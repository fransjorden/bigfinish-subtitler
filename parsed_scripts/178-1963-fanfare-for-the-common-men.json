I sometimes wonder whether it ever was. (BEAT) But I think we properly realised what was happening when we came back from the tour in Sweden. First time we’d played abroad since we’d had a hit, and the second our plane landed back in London it was like —\nMARK: SCENE 2. EXT. LONDON AIRPORT — 1963\nMARK: THEM!’ ‘WE WANT THE BOYS!’ ‘I CAN’T BELIEVE IT!’ BUT MOSTLY IT’S INAUDIBLE. DOCTOR AND NYSSA MUST SHOUT TO BE HEARD.\nDOCTOR: This is what I was talking about, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Why is everyone making so much noise, Doctor? We can’t even see them yet.\nDOCTOR: Just to be in the same place as them is exciting enough.\nNYSSA: So will they play music when they get off the plane?\nDOCTOR: No.\nNYSSA: What will they do?\nDOCTOR: Walk through the airport, get into a car and go home, I expect.\nNYSSA: So all these people are just here to shout at them?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 2\nDOCTOR: Yes, essentially. This is what the Beatles inspired in people.\nNYSSA: Just for playing music?\nDOCTOR: And writing music. And for just being Beatles. Shall we see if\nDOCTOR: we can get a closer look?\nNYSSA: Will it be louder there?\nDOCTOR: Probably about the same, I should\nNYSSA: What?\nDOCTOR: Probably about the same.\nNYSSA: Oh. All right then.\nNYSSA: SCENE 3. INT.

John, Paul, George and... oh.\nNYSSA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Why are there only three of them?\nRITA: Cos there are only three of them, granddad.\nDOCTOR: Only three Beatles?\nRITA: Who are the Beatles?\nDOCTOR: That’s who everyone’s here to see. Isn’t it?\nRITA: Don’t be daft. There’s only one group going to get a crowd like this. The Common Men.\nNYSSA: The who?\nDOCTOR: No, they don’t get together until next year. (TO RITA) The Common Men? They do sound familiar...\nRITA: Of course they do. Mark, James and Korky. Look — they’re coming this way! Oh my god, they’re coming this way!\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Good grief.\nNYSSA: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 4\nDOCTOR: It’s not them.\nRITA: Who are these Beatles then? Are they another group?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nRITA: Are they any good?\nDOCTOR: Well... they were...\nRITA: Nobody’s as good as The Common Men. (SHOUTS) Boys! Over here!\nNYSSA: You haven’t landed us in the wrong place, have you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. 31°* October 1963 — this is definitely right. Something is very, very badly... Oh no!\nNYSSA: What? What are you looking at?\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) Get down! Over there — he’s got a gun!\nDOCTOR: ‘WHAT’S HAPPENING?’ — BUT THE REST OF THE CROWD DROWNS HIM OUT.\nRITA: What?\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) The man in the brown coat! He’s got a gun!\nNYSSA: He’s moving through the crowd. (MOVING OFF) I’1l get him.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa — no!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5.

Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nRITA: Where’d she go? Both of them, they just.. (BREAKS OFF) Where did they go?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea.\nJAMES: What happened to him: the loony with the gun?\nDOCTOR: He got away. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 7\nJAMES: As long as everyone’s all right... you’re the one who shouted?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I saw him in the crowd, he pulled a gun...\nRITA: He just vanished...\nJAMES: Funny noise his gun made.\nDOCTOR: Yes, funny. I’m afraid I only saw him from behind — I didn’t get a good look at his face.\nJAMES: Nice to meet you, anyway. I’m James.\nRITA: Yes, I know.\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, and this is...\nRITA: Um. Er. Rita.\nJAMES: Me and the boys’d like to say thanks — can we buy you a drink?\nDOCTOR: There’s really no — (BEAT) Actually yes.\nJAMES: Great. Come on by the bar in the First Class lounge. (BEGINS\nHEADING: OFF; CALLS BACK) Bring your girlfriend too, if you like.\nRITA: (CALLS) I’m not his girlfriend. (TO DOCTOR) D’you think he heard that?\nDOCTOR: I’ll happily set him straight, if it matters to you.\nRITA: Sorry. Not a big deal, is it, after what happened to your friend.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR: I have to find her.\nRITA: I did see what I thought I saw, didn’t I?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nRITA: She just faded out like she was never here. Was she a ghost?\nDOCTOR: No, she accidentally piggy-backed onto a matter dematerialisation device.\nRITA: (BEAT) OK.\nDOCTOR: Looked like it was fourth-dimensional, and it must’ve been small enough to wear under his coat so he can’t have travelled that far.. which narrows it down to anywhere on this planet within a temporal radius of a decade or two. Wonderful.\nRITA: I’m not sure if I’m still recovering from the shock or if you’re just talking gibberish.\nDOCTOR: Simple version: the gunman escaped somewhere in time and Nyssa’s been dragged along with him.\nRITA: Right.\nDOCTOR: It must have something to do with the change in history — so going for a drink with the three men at the centre of that change seems as good a place as any to start.\nRITA: You think they know who that guy was?\nDOCTOR: I assume he's not a friend, since he was firing an impulse laser at them, but we’1ll see what we can find out.\nRITA: We? You mean you and me?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: It might be useful to have someone along who knows about them. If you don’t mind.\nRITA: What kind of idiot would mind meeting the Common Men?\nRITA: SCENE 7. EXT. DOCKS — 1960\nRITA: AND NYSSA HERE. THE NOISE OF THE TIME MACHINE SOUNDS UNSTEADY, UNHEALTHY.\nNYSSA: (COMPLETING HER SENTENCE AS THEY MATERIALIZE) [Before he tries] again. Oof!\nNYSSA: FROM A COUPLE OF FEET IN THE AIR. WINDED, LENNY STRUGGLES TO GET TO HIS FEET.\nLENNY: Get off me, you stupid-!\nNYSSA: (CLINGING TO HIM) Not until you tell me who you are — and where we are!\nKORKY: (OFF) Hey! What’re you doing with that lass?\nLENNY: Damn!\nLENNY: TO HER.\nKORKY: You all right, love?\nNYSSA: I.. I think so.\nKORKY: (CALLS) Give us a hand, boys!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 10\nJAMES: Damsel in distress, is it Korks?\nMARK: Usually your department, James.\nJAMES: I know. I’m envious.\nKORKY: Help me get her up.\nMARK: Oh, now he wants help, but you see if he wants help with her later.\nJAMES: Come on, let’s get the poor girl off the deck.\nNYSSA: Thank you. You’re very kind.\nMARK: So what’s a posh girl like you doing down the docks at midnight?\nKORKY: Give over, Mark. (TO NYSSA) Did you know that bloke, luv?\nNYSSA: No.\nKORKY: Just some creepy kraut, then.\nNYSSA: Kraut?\nJAMES: You know, kraut. German.\nNYSSA: What made you think he was German?\nMARK: (LOUD AND SLOW) Because you’re in Germany, love.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page I1\nKORKY: She must’ve got bopped on the head. (TO NYSSA) Where are you staying? We’ll help you back.\nNYSSA: I don’t know.\nKORKY: We should take her back to the digs. Sit her down where it’s warm.\nJAMES: We’re back onstage in fifteen minutes.\nKORKY: We’ve got time. She needs a cup of tea.\nMARK: We haven’t got a kettle.\nJAMES: Or any tea.\nNYSSA: I’m fine, thank you. (BEAT) You’re the group from the airport.\nMARK: You’ve got us confused with someone else. We’ve never been to an airport in our lives.\nJAMES: We took the boat train.\nKORKY: Come on. Come back with us.\nJAMES: Korky!\nKORKY: We’ll make the gig! And if we don’t, we’ll get The Beatles to cover for us.\nNYSSA: Beatles. I came to see the Beatles.\nMARK: Then you’ve had a wasted trip. It’s their night off tonight. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nMARK: When we dragged her back to our place, she asked what year it was. I never thought it at the time, but obviously now I realise she was on something. You could probably get it back then if you were posh and knew the right people. But she was alright. Korky liked her a lot. (BEAT) I wonder what happened to her?\nMARK: SCENE 9. INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE — 1963\nLOW: CHAT MURMUR, NOTHING AUDIBLE. PLANES TAKING OFF IN BACKGROUND.\nRITA: I’ve never been on a plane.\nDOCTOR: I’m not getting on one any time soon. Not after what happened last time.\nMARK: What’re you drinking, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just a ginger ale for me, thank you Jo[hn]- um, Mark.\nJAMES: And for you, Rita?\nRITA: Gin and tonic.\nWAITER: I’ll bring those over for you, sir.\nJAMES: Still can’t get used to all this VIP treatment.\nKORKY: I think I could get used to it.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 13\nMARK: I think I will get used to it. Enjoy it while it lasts, fellas.\nRITA: What’d you mean? You’re not splitting up, are you?\nJAMES: I’m not splitting up, are you Mark?\nMARK: No, I’m not. Are you Korky?\nKORKY: No, I’m not. Still in one piece here.\nJAMES: See, we’re at the top now, but how long d’you get at the top? A year? Two years? Nobody’s ever had more than that.\nRITA: But you’re better than those other groups.\nMARK: People’1l move on, they always do. They’1ll find a new group with longer hair or tighter trousers.\nMARK: THE TABLE.\nWAITER: Your drinks, gentlemen. Miss.\nKORKY: Cheers.\nMARK: How come you were in the crowd anyways? You're a bit older than our usual audience.\nDOCTOR: I’m a sociologist, I’m studying youth subcultures. I’m interested in why you’re so popular.\nJAMES: Really?\nMARK: Kids like pop music. There you go, job done.\nKORKY: (LAUGHS) So much for sociology!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: No, I think Rita's right. I think perhaps there is something different about your success.\nJAMES: It’s true that nobody’s ever been this big before. Not in England, anyway.\nKORKY: Don’t tell Cliff Richard, mind.\nMARK: Maybe everyone was just ready for something to happen, and we're it. It could’ve been anyone, it happened to be us.\nRITA: But you’re great.\nMARK: I know we are. But we’ve been lucky, too. Back in Hamburg, a lot of good groups broke up ‘cause of national service.\nDOCTOR: National service?\nJAMES: We all got out of it. Flat feet, me.\nKORKY: Bad eyesight.\nMARK: ; Art student. Vital to the running of the country. Apparently.\nRITA: I wish my brother had got out of it.\nJAMES: Why?\nRITA: Training accident. He never wanted to do it in the first place.\nMARK: (BEAT) Oh, love, I’m sorry. Look at us sitting here laughing about getting out of it —\nRITA: I’m glad you got out of it. Nobody should have to do it, I mean what are we doing it for? So we can go off and help the Yanks in Vietnam?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Vietnam? (ALOUD) You said a lot of good groups in Hamburg broke up.. what other groups [were there —]\nJAMES: Hey up, gaffer’s giving us the nod.\nMARK: What’s the rush? We’ve not got a gig tonight.\nKORKY: He’s probably set up an interview or a photo session or a recording session or he wants us to open a supermarket.\nDOCTOR: I wonder if it would be possible [to see you again] —\nJAMES: Of course! Tickets. Least we can do. Look, here’s a couple for the Royal Variety, Monday night. Backstage too.\nDOCTOR: Can we talk then?\nJAMES: Sure.\nMARK: Come on.\nKORKY: And thanks again!\nRITA: Wow. Thanks for letting me tag along. I don’t know how I can ever pay you back —\nDOCTOR: You can start by telling me more about your brother.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. INT. BUNK ROOM — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: REVELRY. DOOR OPENS. NYSSA AND THE COMMON MEN WALK IN.\nKORKY: And this is our room...\nNYSSA: (BEAT) Oh.\nJAMES: It was like this when we got here. Honest. Wasn't it, Mark?\nMARK: Actually it was a bit worse. We cleaned that window.\nNYSSA: It’s fine — sorry, what was your name?\nKORKY: Korky. Like the cat.\nNYSSA: What cat?\nMARK: I’m sure it’s not what you’re used to, princess. But it’s all we serfs can afford.\nNYSSA: I’m not a princess.\nMARK: No, but you’re close enough that you didn’t realise that was a joke.\nKORKY: Stop confusing the poor lass, Mark. She’s had a shock.\nJAMES: Where are you from?\nNYSSA: (BEAT) Esher.\nMARK: (POSH VOICE) Oh Esher.\nNYSSA: I should find that man. The one from the docks.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 17\nJAMES: So he can beat you up again?\nNYSSA: He didn’t beat me up. But he’s dangerous and I need to know what he’s planning to do.\nKORKY: Should you be looking for him, if he’s dangerous?\nJAMES: Just want to remind you all, we’ve got a gig tonight. Now, as it happens.\nNYSSA: I need to go, I can’t waste any time.\nMARK: You also can’t wander around Hamburg this time of night on your own.\nJAMES: Why doesn’t she come and see the show?\nKORKY: Good idea. Then we can help you find that spotty herbert afterwards.\nNYSSA: I’m not sure it’s really my thing.\nMARK: If you came to see The Beatles, pet, you’re going to love us.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. INT. AITRPORT LOUNGE — 1963\nRITA: Dad didn’t tell me exactly what happened to Greg. It was something to do with... they were training with live ammunition.\nDOCTOR: It shouldn’t have happened.\nRITA: No, that’s what I’m saying, he shouldn’t have had to go on service.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but more than that... this will sound very odd, Rita.\nRITA: I’ve had a very odd day.\nDOCTOR: Right. (BEAT) In the version of history I know, National Service ended three years ago.\nRITA: What do you mean, ‘the version you know’?\nDOCTOR: I travel in time. I’ve seen the future. Sometimes history changes — sometimes in minor ways that don’t affect the bigger picture, sometimes... it’s like this.\nRITA: (BEAT) Assuming I buy all this — how does something like that happen?\nDOCTOR: Usually, because someone makes it change. Like switching points on a railway line — the train heads off in a different direction.\nRITA: Why would someone want National Service to keep going?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Maybe that was just a side effect of the main objective.\nRITA: You're saying Greg died as a side effect?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: Side effects can kill, that’s why you read the label before you take medicine. What I mean is, I wonder if the real point was to take The Beatles out of their place in history.\nRITA: The Beatles? That other group you were talking about?\nDOCTOR: Yes. In the world I know, they’re the ones who’ve got hundreds of fans greeting them at the airport.\nRITA: So The Common Men forced loads of lads into the army so they could be the biggest pop group in Britain?\nDOCTOR: In the world, if things continue along the same course. But it may not be their doing — it’s hard to tell.\nRITA: So what are you going to do about it?\nDOCTOR: You and I are going on a magical mystery tour.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12. INT. TARDIS — 1963\nRITA: Oh.\nDOCTOR: It’s my time machine.\nRITA: Inside a police box.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Always feels like she’s come home when we pop back here. To the 1960s, I mean. Not to London Airport.\nRITA: So... it’s all true then.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now, you asked what I was going to do. National Service should have been abolished at the end of 1960...\nRITA: So — you’re going to go back and change it? Just like that?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it’1ll be that easy, but I'll certainly try.\nRITA: And that would bring Greg back?\nDOCTOR: Logically, it would stop him being in the accident, so...\nRITA: Then I’1l help. Anything you need me to do.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. I was hoping you’d say that.\nRITA: Until we came in here I did think you were mad, you know.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know.\nRITA: Now I’m wondering if I am.\nRITA: WORKING AT THE CONTROLS DURING NEXT SPEECH.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: National Service was abolished in 1960, but it was wound down from 1957... so let’s look for the reasons why that didn’t happen. If we start with the Suez fallout and work from —\nDOCTOR: (TO TARDIS) Come on, old girl...\nDOCTOR: All right, all right!\nRITA: What’s the problem?\nDOCTOR: Er.. normally it does travel in time. Honestly.\nRITA: But not today?\nDOCTOR: Let me see...\nDOCTOR: 1940. Not a problem. Interesting.\nRITA: Er... are we in the middle of an air raid?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, I expect so.\nDOCTOR: DOWN.\nDOCTOR: — CHUNKS OF EARTH — INSIDE & ONTO RITA.\nRITA: Look! You didn’t have to take me into the Blitz just to prove\nRITA: this thing’s a real time machine. Can we go please?\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR: I didn’t just do it to prove the TARDIS works, though. I needed to know whether the TARDIS had a fault... or whether someone else had intervened.\nRITA: How d’you mean?\nDOCTOR: A part of Earth's history has been time-locked.\nRITA: What does that mean? You can’t go there?\nDOCTOR: Essentially. It’s complex and very, very difficult to pull off, but someone has locked off the time vortex all around that point in 1957.\nRITA: To stop you doing what you just tried to do.\nDOCTOR: That seems the logical assumption, doesn’t it? Someone’s changed history, and now they’re stopping me — or anyone else — from changing it back.\nRITA: So what now?\nDOCTOR: Back to 1963.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: MUSIKER?’ ‘ES IST EINE KALTE NACHT DRAUBEN’, ‘DU SIEHST TOLL\nAUS: HEUTE ABEND’, ‘HEY BARKEEPER! VIER WEITERE BIERE HIER!’ (I\nWILL: SUPPLY MORE IF NEEDED.) MUSIC ON JUKEBOX.\nJAMES: Ta dah! The Pfannkuchen Club!\nNYSSA: Gosh. (COUGHS)\nKORKY: Nyssa? Can I get you a drink?\nMARK: Or a gas mask?\nNYSSA: It is very smoky.\nJAMES: Ah yes. The sweet smell of success, eh Mark?\nMARK: (WINE CRITIC VOICE) James, I’m getting aromas of sweat and just a hint of stale beer...\nNYSSA: I’m afraid I don’t have any money...\nKORKY: Don’t worry: I’1ll get it.\nMARK: Don’t let Gunter see you buying drinks for girls, Korky. He’1l think he’s paying us too much.\nNYSSA: I’d just like some water, please.\nJAMES: Get her a coffee. She could do with something to perk her up.\nMARK: If she needs something to perk her up, boys, then the best thing we can do is get up there and play.\nKORKY: (TO BARMAN) Coffee and a glass of water for the lady.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 24\nJAMES: & MARK: (MOCKING) ‘The lady’!\nNYSSA: Thank you.\nJAMES: (OFF) Come on!\nJAMES: ‘MACH SHAU!’ OPENING BARS OF ‘WHO IS THAT MAN’.\nJAMES: SCENE 14. EXT. STREET — 1963\nRITA: Hi Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Rita. How did you get on?\nRITA: The woman at the first house said John lives in town now. She thought I was an old girlfriend come round because I was in trouble, or something.\nDOCTOR: Did she say what he’s doing?\nRITA: He’s still in a group. They’re called The Famous Five. It’s a joke name because there’s four of them.\nDOCTOR: (IN CHORUS WITH RITA) ..there’s four of them.\nRITA: I asked who else was in the group, because I thought they might be your Beatles with a different name, but she said they were called Pete, Chas and another Pete.\nDOCTOR: What about the other house?\nRITA: I met Paul, he was visiting his dad. He was nice. He’s a clerk at a shipping office. But yeah, he did his service.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: So did George. He’s back now, apprenticed to his father. Ringo didn’t get called up because of health problems — but he was never in the group in the first place. Both George and Ringo knew The Common Men from the clubs in Hamburg.\nRITA: So did Paul. He said he was going to get in touch and offer them some songs. I told him they’ve got lots of good songs of their own. He said so does he.\nDOCTOR: But he’s missed his moment, and he’s lost his group. The perfect storm which created The Beatles has been quelled.\nRITA: And The Common Men have stepped in.\nDOCTOR: But was it really as easy as that?\nRITA: They’re a great group. Talent will out, as my mum used to say.\nDOCTOR: But can they keep it up like The Beatles did? I suppose we’1l see on Monday how good they are.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: THREE’. HUGE CHEER FROM CROWD, INCLUDING NYSSA AND SADIE (LATE TEENS, CONFIDENT).\nJAMES: (ON MIC) Cheers, we’ve been The Common Men and we’1l continue to be so tomorrow!\nJAMES: UNGLAUBLICH!’ ‘JAMES SANG SO GUT HEUTE,’ ‘SIE MACHEN EINEN\nGROBEN: VERSION EINES SONGS VON LITTLE RICHARD’.\nNYSSA: Heavens.\nSADIE: Aren’t they great? I’ve been watching them since Liverpool, but they get better and better!\nNYSSA: Liverpool?\nSADIE: They’re from Liverpool. Can’t you tell from the accent?\nNYSSA: I’m not very good with accents.\nSADIE: Expect everyone north of Hertfordshire sounds the same to you.\nNYSSA: Er.. yes. So do you know them?\nSADIE: No. Not properly. I’m just a fan to them.\nNYSSA: Gosh. You must like them a lot to follow them around like this.\nSADIE: Best group in the world. In the universe, probably. And one day everybody’1l agree with me.\nKORKY: (APPROACHING) Nyssa! Nyssa!\nSADIE: (TO NYSSA; SHARPLY) You know them?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 27\nNYSSA: We just met. Hello, Korky.\nKORKY: (ARRIVING) Well, what d’you think?\nNYSSA: It was very... energetic.\nJAMES: Throw the poor kid a bone, love.\nNYSSA: I liked it. I’ve just never seen anything quite like it before. Where I come from, music is far more formalised and complex.\nMARK: Probably brought up on Beethoven and that, weren’t you?\nNYSSA: Everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot.\nSADIE: It was amazing.\nKORKY: Yeah, cheers Sadie.\nJAMES: It was a good night tonight. You got lucky.\nMARK: Lucky nothing. Korky was trying extra hard to impress his new friend.\nKORKY: Give over.\nMARK: I’m not knocking it, she can come and watch us every night if that’s what happens.\nJAMES: Hey! If you’re going to take pictures, Sadie luv, at least give me a chance to do me hair first.\nSADIE: sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nMARK: Something seemed to click around then. When we came back from Hamburg and played Liverpool again — crowds went mad. Went on tour, crowds went mad. You couldn’t hear yourself play. It got frightening sometimes. They called it Common Mania. (BEAT) When did they start saying Common Mania? Was it after the Royal Variety?\nMARK: SCENE 17. INT. DRESSING ROOM — 1963\nMARK: You’d have thought they’d have given us separate dressing rooms. Mind you, the Queen has to sit in that ashtray all evening, so I suppose we got off lightly.\nJAMES: Here, Mark, listen to this.\nMARK: What?\nMORE: FRENZIED, AS THE CROWD CAN SEE HIM AT THE WINDOW. ‘JAMES!’ ‘OH MY GOD!’ ‘JUMP, WE’LL CATCH YOU!’ ‘LOVE YOU JAMES!’\nJAMES: Evening girls.\nTHING: HAPPENS.\nMARK: If we shook our hair and shouted ‘C’mon baby’ and then told them to invade Czechoslovakia I swear they’d do it. Well, at any rate they’d give it a go.\nKORKY: Boys! We’re on.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. INT. AUDITORIUM — 1963\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAY?’ ‘SAW THEM AT MARGATE IN THE SUMMER, THEY WERE INCREDIBLE’.\nRITA: I can’t believe they’re not top of the bill. That last act was a waste of space!\nDOCTOR: If everything goes the same way as it did for The Beatles, Rita, it won’t matter. This is the only part of the night anyone will remember.\nCOMPERE: (OFF) Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome the year’s top pop sensation... The Common Men!\nCOMPERE: ‘OH WON’T YOU PLEASE LOVE ME?’. LET THIS PLAY FOR HALF A MINUTE OR SO, THEN CONTINUE UNDER DIALOGUE.\nGOING: WILD. REALLY WILD. ‘SO GOOD!’ ‘THEY’RE THE BEST!’ ‘LOVE THEM!’\nDOCTOR: Not bad.\nRITA: Not bad!\nDOCTOR: The reaction is extraordinary though... even more than The Beatles got.\nRITA: That’s cos they’re better than your Beatles.\nDOCTOR: Rita, remember what it cost to get them to this point. Your brother, and all the other... Is the Queen Mother is actually doing the twist up there?\nRITA: They’re fab!\nDOCTOR: Fab Three... not quite the same, is it...\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 30\nSADIE: (SHARPLY; HARSHLY) If you don’t like it, shut up. Or better yet, go home.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t say I disliked them, I just —\nSADIE: (TO EVERYONE ELSE) This bloke says they’re rubbish!\nTHINK: HE IS?’ ‘SHUT UP!’\nDOCTOR: I only said — Get off me! I don’t want to call a member of security over, but —\nRITA: Stop it, Doctor! She’s right!\nSADIE: Yeah!\nDOCTOR: Rita! What’s the [matter with —]\nRITA: (INCREASINGLY HYSTERICAL) You’re spoiling it! This is the most important moment in the history of probably the world and there you are yamming away about this, and that, and everyone should just listen to them!\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) We’re getting out of here.\nRITA: No! No, we’ve got to stay and — let go of my arm!\nSADIE: Yeah! Let go of her!\nDOCTOR: It’s for your own good, Rita. And mine.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. INT. THEATRE CORRIDOR — 1963\nCOMMON: MEN’S SONG — THIS IS CONTINUOUS.\nRITA: What the hell d’you think you’re doing, taking me out of there when the [most important —]\nDOCTOR: Rita. Listen to me. (SEARCHING HIS POCKETS) Oh, where is it?\nRITA: You get me into the biggest thing that’s ever happened and drag me out after a minute, what kind of a cruel [trick —]\nDOCTOR: Aha! Pocket watch! (THE CHINK OF THE CHAIN AS THE WATCH DANGLES\nFROM: IT, THEN THE DOCTOR SWINGS IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE — WE HEAR THE TICKING SWING FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE STEREO FIELD\nDURING: ) Look, Rita, watch it going back and forth.\nRITA: What’re you trying to do, hypnotise me into thinking what you said [about them —]\nDOCTOR: No, just trying to get you to focus on something else.\nBACKGROUND: ATMOSPHERE FADES AWAY.\nRITA: But I don’t... understand what you... what... Doctor?\nDOCTOR: All right now?\nRITA: Yeah.\nRITA: THE BACKGROUND LEAPS BACK TO NORMAL.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nRITA: (BEAT) That was strange.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR: What was strange?\nRITA: I... just couldn’t think of anything else... when we were in there. With them on the stage. I wanted to know everything about them, wanted to keep them with me all the time.\nDOCTOR: And that’s different to how you felt before? At the airport?\nRITA: It’s sort of the same... but more so. The excitement was there, same as before. The need to see them. Only this time I felt... I felt like I’d kill for it.\nRITA: SCENE 20. INT. AUDITORIUM — 1963\nJAMES: Thank you very much. Thank you.\nMARK: Thank you, your majesty. But you were only supposed to rattle your jewels, not throw them!\nKORKY: Don’t worry, ma’am: we’1ll return your ring after the show.\nMARK: Much appreciated, but we don’t need it thanks — we’re all right for a bob or two these days.\nJAMES: Now we'd like to sing you a number that’s been in our set since we played the clubs in Germany —\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT. THEATRE CORRIDOR — 1963\nRITA: Are we allowed in this bit, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m allowed everywhere.\nRITA: What are we looking for?\nDOCTOR: Something is amplifying the effect the group has on the crowd. It could be something about the group themselves, some kind of psychic power they have, or it could be something artificial.\nRITA: Like a machine?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Let’s try the understage area...\nRITA: How could a machine change how people feel about them?\nDOCTOR: A hundred years ago you might have asked how a machine could make you hear the voice of a person who wasn’t in the same room as you. You’ll find machines can do all manner of remarkable — Aha!\nRITA: That noise again.\nDOCTOR: Through there! Quickly!\nJUST: DYING AS THEY ENTER.\nDOCTOR: Gah! Missed him.\nRITA: The man who shot at them, his machine made that noise.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: Yes. Quickly, get a reading...\nDOCTOR: (ALL WHILE RITA TALKS).\nRITA: Why would someone shoot at The Common Men, then sit in the basement of the Prince Of Wales Theatre trying to make people like them more? (BEAT) What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Ever since the incident at the airport, I’ve been carrying this around. It’s a component of the TARDIS, reads residual time traces and works out where, or rather when, someone’s gone... you have to get it before the trail goes cold...\nRITA: Does that mean you’ve got something?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Back to the TARDIS, quickly!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. INT. THEATRE CORRIDOR — 1963\nCORRIDOR: AS BEFORE.\nRITA: I’ve still got no idea what’s going on.\nDOCTOR: No shame in that, Rita, I’ve no idea either. This is one of those ones which is like a jigsaw with most of the pieces miss— (BREAKS OFF) Ah. Hello.\nHEADED: BY SADIE, EMITTING A MALEVOLENT MURMUR. ‘THERE THEY ARE,’ ‘HATE HIM,’ ‘LOOK AT HIM’.\nSADIE: It’s him again.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nSADIE: He hates them.\nDOCTOR: No, not at all —\nRITA: Listen. There’s something wrong here, he’s just trying to work out what it is.\nSADIE: Kill him.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSADIE: Kill him!\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand! Something’s controlling your thoughts, manipulating you into-.\nRITA: Let’s get out of here.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR: Good idea. Let’s try the stage door.\nDOCTOR: ‘KILL HIM! KILL HIM!’ FROM BEHIND THEM.\nRITA: Too late! There’s more of them behind us — look!\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear. We’re trapped!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 37"

Only by applying the fifth dimension — which is invisible to us — can we truly\nPARAVATAR: understand the universe.\nDOCTOR: But not invisible to you, I assume?\nPARAVATAR: Not when I focus my mind.\nJAMES: Guru Paravatar, this is the Doctor.\nMARK: So it is!\nKORKY: How’s it going? Haven’t seen you since —\nJAMES: The airport. And he says there might [be another —]\nDOCTOR: Delighted to meet you, Paravatar.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 51\nPARAVATAR: And you too, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But not as delighted as you were to meet The Common Men, I expect. The three most famous people in the world by now, presumably?\nPARAVATAR: I take all people equally, provided they have an open mind.\nDOCTOR: Yes, an open mind is certainly a virtue, as long as you know when to close it.\nMARK: You all right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m fine. Mr Paravatar —\nPARAVATAR: It’s just Paravatar.\nDOCTOR: Could I speak to you in private?\nPARAVATAR: You don’t have to push.\nKORKY: Hey, hang about —\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Just five minutes, please.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34.

SIDE ROOM — 1967\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOOR CLOSES.\nPARAVATAR: I’d be only too happy to grant you a private session at the appropriate time, Doctor —\nDOCTOR: Why have you changed Earth’s history, Mr Paravatar?\nPARAVATAR: I want my teachings to have an impact, but I wouldn’t say I’ve changed history.\nDOCTOR: Don’t play the idiot. I know another time sensitive when I see one.\nPARAVATAR: (BEAT) Ah.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nPARAVATAR: (DROPPING THE MYSTICAL ACT/ACCENT) You’re a Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately for you, yes. What are you — Ferutu? Apalapucian?\nPARAVATAR: No, Turanthian.\nDOCTOR: And I’ve just traced a time machine through from 1963 to this exact spot.\nPARAVATAR: It wasn’t me. I haven’t time-travelled in decades.\nDOCTOR: We’ll see about that.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. No residual vortex energy on you...\nPARAVATAR: I’m retired. That’s what I came to Earth to get away from.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid it’s not the quiet little backwater it might seem.\nPARAVATAR: I’ve found it perfectly pleasant. I live in a remote part of Indonesia, I teach people to get a different perspective on life by using my experience as a time-sensitive. But then something happened to the timelines.\nDOCTOR: You know what happened?\nPARAVATAR: No. I knew once, but it’s faded now.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Only a Time Lord, or someone who was outside of Time when it happened would retain their old memories.\nPARAVATAR: It was ten years ago. At first I couldn’t put my finger on what had happened, then I saw a picture of those young men ina newspaper and I immediately knew it had something to do with them. I’ve been trying to get close to them ever since.\nDOCTOR: The Common Men shouldn’t be here at all. The biggest pop group on Earth should be a band called The Beatles.\nPARAVATAR: Beatles?\nDOCTOR: A phenomenon, an integral part of a revolution in western culture, and someone has taken them out and put those three men in their place.\nPARAVATAR: Why?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. So far, they seem to be following almost exactly the same track of history The Beatles did. If you’re not going to do it differently, why do it at all?\nPARAVATAR: For the thrill of walking in their heroes’ footsteps perhaps?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: Like some insanely elaborate karaoke? There is a sort of slavish devotion about what they’re doing — they’re not as good, but they’re copying The Beatles to the best of their ability.\nPARAVATAR: So they’ve seen what this other group did, and they’re copying cee\nDOCTOR: It seems that way, but why do that and then sing different songs? Surely the whole point would be to pretend you wrote A Day In The Life? So do they know there was this whole other timeline, or not?\nPARAVATAR: Shall we find out?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. EXT. HALL — 1967\nDOCTOR WHO: THEIR HEROES — ‘COME BACK, JAMES!’ ‘WE WANT TO SEE YOU, KORKY!’ ‘MARK! HEY, MARK!’\nSADIE: Didn’t you recognise him, Lenny? From the theatre?\nLENNY: Sadie, I never saw him. You dealt with him. I was gone by the time he got down there.\nSADIE: We don’t want him getting near them, do we?\nLENNY: No way. (ADJUSTING THE MACHINE) Ready?\nLENNY: LENNY’S MACHINE WHICH MAKES THE FANS GO WILD RISES — IMPERCEPTIBLE AT FIRST, LOUD BY THE END OF THE SCENE.\nLENNY: So what’s really going on in there?\nSADIE: I got a look at the bloke they came to see.\nLENNY: I heard about him, he sounded like a total whack job.\nLENNY: ‘WHO IS HE ANYWAY?’\nSADIE: Yeah, definitely a weirdo. And we don’t know what he’s doing with them.\nLENNY: He could be doing anything. I think he’s bad news.\nLENNY: ‘THIS IS BAD’.\nLENNY: Someone should get in there and save them.\nSADIE: But the door’s locked.\nLENNY: Then beat it down.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36. INT. HALL — 1967\nMARK: Hark at them out there, eh James?\nJAMES: I’ve not seen them this bad since last year.\nKORKY: And that was Americans.\nPARAVATAR: (MYSTICAL ACT/ACCENT BACK ON) Sorry — now, where were we?\nMARK: What was all that about?\nDOCTOR: I think there’s someone here who means you harm — but it isn’t\nDOCTOR: him.\nKORKY: It’s starting to feel like there’s about five hundred people\nKORKY: out there who mean us harm.\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen this before...\nMARK: So have we. Every day for four years.\nJAMES: Not usually this bad though.\nDOCTOR: Someone’s amplifying it at specific moments. Royal Variety. A group of your fans tried to\nKORKY: Are you serious about this?\nDOCTOR: I saw it at the tear me to pieces.\nDOCTOR: Entirely. There’s something very wrong happening, and I’m\nDOCTOR: afraid it centres on you three.\nMARK: Everything centres on us three.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 57\nJAMES: What sort of very wrong something?\nKORKY: They’re battering on the windows!\nPARAVATAR: Doctor — I do have the ability to throw up a psychic shield, that should be enough to stave them off.\nDOCTOR: Do it.\nJAMES: Psychic what?\nKORKY: Bloomin’ heck.\nDOCTOR: (CLAPS HANDS) Now! Paravatar has suggested a meditation session.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37. INT. BUNK ROOM — 1960\nNYSSA: Of course, these aren’t laboratory conditions...\nKORKY: You’re kidding me.\nNYSSA: So any result we produce can’t be regarded as one hundred per cent accurate. But it should be a fair indicator.\nKORKY: Of what?\nNYSSA: If I’m right, I’1ll tell you. If I’m not, we’1ll laugh about how silly I was and then forget about it. Can I take a sample of your blood?\nKORKY: I don’t like the sight of blood.\nNYSSA: Then close your eyes.\nKORKY: What are you taking it with?\nNYSSA: A hypodermic needle.\nKORKY: That’s OK then. Where’d you get a hypoAAARGH!\nNYSSA: Sorry, I lied. That was a hairpin. I thought it might help put you at ease if you thought it wasn’t.\nKORKY: Thanks, it did.\nNYSSA: Just let it drop into the glass.\nNYSSA: That’s enough. Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nKORKY: This had better be worth it.\nNYSSA: Hmm.\nKORKY: What?\nNYSSA: I was right.\nKORKY: About what?\nNYSSA: You really don’t know?\nKORKY: No!\nNYSSA: Then you’d better sit down.\nNYSSA: Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38. INT. HALL — 1967\nDOCTOR WHO: QUIETLY. THEN THE COMMON MEN TAIL OFF, ONE BY ONE, AND\nPARAVATAR: STOPS TOO.\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS THE ACT) They’re under, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Will they tell the truth, Paravatar?\nPARAVATAR: If I want them to, yes.\nDOCTOR: Right. (TO GROUP) Have any of you deliberately Earth’s history?\nMARK: No.\nJAMES: No.\nKORKY: No.\nDOCTOR: Do you know who has changed things?\nMARK: No.\nJAMES: No.\nKORKY: No.\nDOCTOR: interfered with\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Right. This is turning out to be fruitful so far.\nPARAVATAR: Doctor... I can see into their minds.\nDOCTOR: Anything useful in there?\nPARAVATAR: Yes. Something very useful indeed.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39. INT. BUNK ROOM — 1960\nKORKY: (LAUGHS) An alien!\nNYSSA: Korky, I’m serious.\nKORKY: I think I’d know if I was an alien, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: But you only know what it feels like to be you.\nKORKY: I’m no more an alien than you are.\nNYSSA: I’m not really from Esher. I’m from the planet Traken.\nKORKY: Oh.\nNYSSA: It was destroyed by an entropy field. I’m the last of my people.\nKORKY: Oh god.\nNYSSA: It’s more common than you might think.\nKORKY: I’ve got a mum and dad! Well, had a dad —\nNYSSA: 61\nNYSSA: Someone might have wiped your memory. Implanted other memories,\nNYSSA: so you don’t know where you really came from.\nKORKY: Or maybe I crash-landed on Earth as a baby, like Superman.\nNYSSA: Maybe.\nKORKY: He was the last of his people too. You and him would get like a house on fire.\nKORKY: on\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 62\nNYSSA: Don’t you want to find out the truth about yourself?\nKORKY: Stop it now.\nNYSSA: Your skin’s a flesh-suit. I’ve seen the technology before — it conceals the shape of the being inside, a perfect disguise. It could grow along with you and seem to age naturally. But I can tell from how your blood behaves.\nKORKY: I can’t deal with this. Go and play your trick on Mark, he’s the joker.\nNYSSA: The seal for the flesh-suit is here. At the top of your neck.\nKORKY: I’m not going to take my skin off! I’m not... Oh man.\nNYSSA: Come here. Don’t be afraid. I’1l show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40. EXT. HALL — 1967\nLARGELY: UNINTELLIGIBLE. SNATCHES OF ‘BREAK IT DOWN!’ ‘GET INSIDE!’\nLENNY: Come on! Break down the door! Get in there! The boys need you!\nSADIE: What is going on in there, Len?\nLENNY: Sadie, how should I know?\nSADIE: Can’t you feel the resistance?\nLENNY: Resistance? No.\nSADIE: It’s like something’s pushing me back — but not physically. In my head. Every time I push, something tells me not to.\nLENNY: Then push harder!\nSADIE: But it hurts.\nLENNY: I don’t care. Push harder!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. INT. HALL — 1967\nPARAVATAR: (IN FULL MYSTICAL MODE) What are your names?\nMARK: Mayanas.\nJAMES: Jecomyn.\nKORKY: Kapraban.\nDOCTOR: Good grief.\nPARAVATAR: And where are you from?\nMARK: The Court of Caldy. Me mam’s the Queen y’see. Me dad’s one of the miners under the castle — she always tells me never you mind who he is, that’s not important. All that matters is he was strong, so I’d be strong too. I’d get my brains from her.\nJAMES: The Convent of Health. Me parents own the place, it’1l all be mine one day they say. They don’t know how any of it works but rich folk pay a fortune to get well there.\nKORKY: The Wheel of Contact. Me dad’s one of the ambassadors. Knows everybody, he does. I never get to see anyone except the other ambassadors’ kids. It’s alright though, y’know.\nDOCTOR: Where are these places?\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) Nowhere on Earth.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. None of them are human. (TO COMMON MEN) What planet is at?\nJAMES: Bional.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: Never heard of it. (TO PARAVATAR) These memories you’re uncovering — do they know anything about them?\nPARAVATAR: No. It’s all buried.\nDOCTOR: Then they don’t know. They don’t know they’re not human.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42. INT. BUNK ROOM — 1960\nKORKY: How could I not have known? I’m such an idiot.\nNYSSA: Someone probably conditioned you not to think about it, Korky.\nKORKY: What?\nNYSSA: The mind can be manipulated, and if it’s done skilfully you never know, because you’ve been manipulated not to notice.\nKORKY: You believe me that I never knew? Because I didn’t.\nNYSSA: Yes, I believe you. But what about the others?\nKORKY: Mark and James? You think they’re aliens too?\nNYSSA: Possibly. If they are, do they know?\nKORKY: We need to find out, don’t we.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. INT. HALL — 1967\nDOCTOR: Paravatar, have their memories been blocked because of some trauma, or has someone done it deliberately?\nPARAVATAR: It’s so comprehensive, Doctor — it must have been done deliberately.\nDOCTOR: Then they probably don’t know they shouldn’t be here at all. And someone must have brought them here.\nPARAVATAR: (TO GROUP; RESUMING ACT) Who brought you here?\nMARK: Don’t know.\nJAMES: I was there and then I was here.\nKORKY: I was too young to understand.\nDOCTOR: That settles it. Someone is manipulating them. They were planted here very young, given a space to take over The Beatles’ lives. And the way they’ve followed the same line ever Since can’t be a coincidence. They’re still being manipulated.\nPARAVATAR: They need to know what they are.\nDOCTOR: Can you lift the block on their memories?\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) I can try. (TO COMMON MEN; RESUMES ACT) Picture your mind as a house. The contents spread over the top floor, the middle floor, the ground floor.\nMARK: Nice house.\nJAMES: Roomy.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 67\nKORKY: Could do with a lick of paint though.\nBREAKING: DOWN.\nPARAVATAR: Now imagine you’re walking through the ground floor... and you see a hatch you’ve never seen before.\nDOCTOR: The crowd are breaking through your defences, Paravatar.\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) I’m sorry — my concentration is split.\nDOCTOR: I’d try to help but I’m a bit out of practice with this sort of thing. Two or three regenerations ago I was quite good.\nPARAVATAR: (TO GROUP; RESUMES ACT) You see a hatch. Now try to open it.\nJAMES: It’s stuck.\nPARAVATAR: Don’t force it.\nDOCTOR: I think you may have to.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. EXT. HALL — 1967\nLENNY: Come on! Break through!\nSADIE: It hurts!\nLENNY: Break through and it’1ll stop! Smash the doors down — before it’s too late!\nLENNY: APPROVAL.\nLENNY: SCENE 45. EXT. STREET — 1960\nKORKY: So why are you here?\nNYSSA: I told you, Korky — we came to see The Beatles.\nKORKY: Really? I mean they’re not bad but if you’re going to come halfway across the galaxy, you should see Buddy Holly, or Chuck Berry, or Elvis.\nNYSSA: We didn’t come to see them here. We came to see them in 1963. The Doctor’s still there.\nKORKY: 1963’s not a place.\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s got a time machine.\nKORKY: (BEAT) You could probably tell me anything at this point.\nNYSSA: When you can travel from the past to the future and back, times start to seem more like places. Here, in 1960, the Doctor’s not around. Three years from now he will be.\nKORKY: So why aren’t you with him?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 69\nNYSSA: I got caught up in someone else’s time-travel equipment.\nKORKY: The man on the docks?\nNYSSA: Yes. That’s why I need to find him. If I can’t, I just have to hope the Doctor finds me.\nKORKY: (BEAT) You said the world you come from’s gone.\nNYSSA: Yes.\nKORKY: But you could go back in time. It’d still be there.\nNYSSA: No. I couldn’t.\nKORKY: But if it works like you say, [then you —]\nNYSSA: It’s not impossible. But I couldn’t.\nKORKY: Oh. I see.\nNYSSA: My home is with the Doctor now.\nKORKY: So.. you and the Doctor —\nKORKY: SHOCKED, PEOPLE TAKING COVER. ‘WAS WAR DAS?’ ‘RAUS DEN WEG!’\nNYSSA: It’s him!\nKORKY: The Doctor?\nNYSSA: No, the man from the docks! He’s found us!\nKORKY: Then come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. INT. HALL — 1967\nDOCTOR WHO: FRANTICALLY. WINDOWS BREAKING, DOORS GIVING WAY. PARAVATAR IS\nSTILL: TALKING TO THE COMMON MEN.\nPARAVATAR: (IN MYSTICAL MODE) The hatch will open... all you have to do is concentrate.\nMARK: No.\nJAMES: We don’t know what’s down there.\nPARAVATAR: Nothing to fear.\nDOCTOR: Paravatar, we’re running out of time.\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) I’m nearly there.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t just a normal crowd of humans. It’s happening again. Something’s driving them wild!\nPARAVATAR: (RESUMES ACT) Just a small push —\nSADIE: (OFF) There he is! And the other freak! Get them away from our boys!\nDOCTOR: Paravatar, come on!\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) But Doctor —\nDOCTOR: Don’t argue! This way!\nDOCTOR: BUILDING.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nMARK: Paravatar? Dunno what his scam was, whether he was going to go through our pockets while he had us hypnotised... or if he was going to make us all sign some business agreement and give him a million quid. We had a plan to go to his retreat in India, or Tibet, or wherever it was, but that got canned. It was one of those days when the fans were going mad. The Doctor warned us... but where was he, eh? So that was when we met Lenny. He saved us, you know.\nMARK: SCENE 48. INT. HALL — 1967\nHYSTERIA: AS BEFORE.\nKORKY: Hey! Get off me!\nMARK: Who let all these in?\nJAMES: Mark? Korks? What... where’s — What happened?\nMARK: Dunno, James, but we’ve got to get out of here.\nKORKY: (CALLS) Doctor? Doctor!\nLENNY: Hey! One side... I’m walking here!\nMARK: Where is the Doctor?\nLENNY: Forget him.\nKORKY: Who are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 72\nLENNY: Lenny Kruger. It’s an honour to meet you.\nJAMES: It’d be more of an honour if someone wasn’t trying to rip the\nJAMES: shirt off my back — get off!\nLENNY: I'll deal with this. (CLEARS THROAT)\nMARK: Try lion taming, mate. It’s safer\nMARK: nicer hat.\nLENNY: (LOUDER) Excuse me!\nLENNY: Thank you, thank you.\nKORKY: (LOW) Get a load of him.\nLENNY: and easier and you get a\nLENNY: QUICKLY.\nLENNY: The boys here appreciate your enthusiasm, but if you could just form an orderly queue in the hallway down there, they’1l sign\nLENNY: autographs on their way out.\nMARK: Jesus.\nLENNY: Not exactly.\nJAMES: What’d you say your name was?\nLENNY: Lenny. Lenny Kruger. The premier manager of rock’n’roll acts in New York, soon to be the premier manager of rock’n’roll acts in\nLENNY: North America, and once I got you\nKORKY: I think you’ve got our attention.\nKORKY: guys... the world.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. EXT. HALL — 1967\nPARAVATAR: (DROPS ACT) I’m sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Paravatar — you helped enormously. We know a great deal more than we did before.\nPARAVATAR: We still don’t know why they’re here.\nDOCTOR: No. But given the effort, someone must be expecting quite a reward.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. EXT. STREET — 1960\nKORKY: Nyssa! Are you all right?\nNYSSA: Yes, Korky. Don’t stop running!\nKORKY: Maybe we should split up?\nNYSSA: Why?\nKORKY: He’s clearly after me —\nNYSSA: We don’t know that. Maybe he’s after me, maybe he’s trying to protect you —\nKORKY: It’s a dead end!\nNYSSA: No! Quickly, if we turn back —\nLENNY: Too late, guys. Sorry. Gotcha now!\nKORKY: Look, I don’t know what you want but I’m just a drummer in a\nLENNY: Oh, you’re a lot more than that. And she knows it.\nNYSSA: Me?\nLENNY: Yeah, you. And I’m gonna find out who you are and what your game is, and then... I’m gonna kill you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 75"

But not enough.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 8&2\nRITA: Why'd he turn against you?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. When we met in 1967, we seemed to be getting on well. But since then, they’ve been giving me the cold shoulder. All of them.\nRITA: He’s changed, that’s for sure. He always had that negative streak, but now... he just seems bitter, and angry.\nDOCTOR: So are you and he...?\nRITA: No.\nDOCTOR: It’s just, I saw you coming out of his building —\nRITA: I’m interviewing him. I’m a journalist now.\nDOCTOR: Gosh.\nRITA: I told you I’d keep finding out more. Eventually people started to ask why I was doing it, and I didn’t want it to seem weird, so I said it was for an article. And then I wrote the article, and it got published.\nDOCTOR: Well done.\nRITA: It was about how National Service was crippling the British youth scene. I interviewed Paul for it.\nDOCTOR: They’ve got rid of it now, but too little, too late.\nRITA: You said you’d come back.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. Been busy. Did you want to ask me something?\nRITA: Yes. Where can you buy sound tapes in New York?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 8&3\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55. INT. AIRPORT — 1970\nDOCTOR WHO: AND LENNY. WE ARE IN NEW YORK.\nCONTROL OFFICER: Passport please, sir.\nLENNY: You need to see this guy’s passport? Really?\nJAMES: Pipe down, Len, it’s fine.\nLENNY: This is James O’Meara, you know. The one and only.\nJAMES: (TO OFFICER) Ignore him. Here.\nCONTROL OFFICER: Thank you sir, enjoy your visit to New York.\nJAMES: I’ve got a feeling I won’t, but thanks.\nLENNY: It’s gonna be great. We’re gonna begin a whole new phase of The Common Men.\nJAMES: Fiver says I don’t even get to see his face. He’1ll shut himself in and wait for us to go away.\nLENNY: Then we won’t go away. He’s gotta come out eventually.\nJAMES: You can stay indoors as long as you like if you’re rich enough, Lenny.\nLENNY: I know you, James. If you don’t give it your best shot you’1ll regret it the rest of your life.\nJAMES: (BEAT) Let’s get it done and we can be home for tea.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE — 1970\nDOCTOR: Rita, have you met their new manager?\nRITA: Met him, been chatted up by him, been sued by him.\nDOCTOR: Sued?\nRITA: He threatened to, anyway. Wanted me to hand over some photos he didn’t like the look of. (TO SHOP ASSISTANT) Just those, please.\nASSISTANT: Sure.\nDOCTOR: I haven’t been able to get near the group since he took over. Remember those hordes of screaming fans who nearly tore us to pieces —\nRITA: — at the Royal Variety? Of course. (TO SHOP ASSISTANT) Thanks.\nDOCTOR: They’re always around now.\nRITA: The group split up and the fans still won’t leave them alone. There’s half a dozen outside Mark’s apartment any time of the day or night, hoping they’1ll see him pop out for milk. That reminds me, I need to pick up some milk.\nDOCTOR: You’re running errands for him?\nRITA: He won’t go outside. He seems afraid of something.\nDOCTOR: He may be right to be.\nRITA: Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR: I think Lenny’s trying to use them.\nRITA: Well, yeah. He’s a rock manager.\nDOCTOR: More than that. That’s why I came here, I hoped I might be able to get close to Mark without Lenny getting in the way.\nRITA: So you want me to take you up to his place?\nRITA: SCENE 57. EXT. DOCKS — 1960\nCATCHING: THEIR BREATH. FOOTSTEPS ON DOCK, A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY. A BOAT’S ENGINE OBSCURES THEIR VOICES.\nNYSSA: (LOW) Korky! Here he comes.\nKORKY: (LOW) OK, I’1l grab his gun.\nNYSSA: (LOW) I’1l1 grab his gun.\nKORKY: (LOW) Nys, come on —\nNYSSA: (LOW) I’ve done this sort of thing a lot more times than you have.\nKORKY: (LOW) Fine, but I’1l run to distract him.\nNYSSA: (LOW) All right. (BEAT) Now. Go!\nLENNY: Stop! Korky! I don’t want to hurt you —\nLENNY: INTO HIM.\nLENNY: Oof!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 86\nNYSSA: (GRUNT OF EFFORT AS SHE GETS THE GUN OFF HIM) Got it!\nKORKY: Nice one!\nLENNY: OK, OK — get off me.\nNYSSA: Now. I want to know who you are, where you got a time from and what you’re —\nKORKY: Argh!\nSADIE: Drop the gun or I’11 cut his throat!\nLENNY: Thanks, Sadie.\nKORKY: Sadie? What’re you doing?\nNYSSA: I thought you loved him?\nSADIE: And I know what’s best for him. Don’t I?\nKORKY: Careful with the knife —\nSADIE: Don’t I?\nKORKY: Whatever you say, doll —\nNYSSA: All right. Here. (DROPS THE GUN)\nLENNY: Thanks. (PICKS IT UP) Let’s all go somewhere a little cosy, yeah?\nLENNY: machine\nLENNY: more\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nDOCTOR WHO: COUNT TO THREE’ PLAYS, THEN THE CRACKLE OF THE NEEDLE, THEN IT\nLIFTS: OFF & THE RECORD STOPS PLAYING. QUIET. MARK IS LOOKING\nOVER: PIECES OF PAPER AND PHOTOGRAPHS. RITA ENTERS.\nRITA: Mark? I got milk, eggs and bread.\nMARK: Fried egg sarnies then. Champion, Rita.\nRITA: Where did you get all those photos?\nMARK: Someone left them in a box outside the door. There’s magazines, too, and tapes of old radio interviews.\nDOCTOR: Quite a collection to just abandon on someone’s doorstep.\nMARK: What’s he doing here?\nRITA: I bumped into him on the street.\nMARK: I told you, he’s bad news.\nDOCTOR: What do you think I’m trying to do?\nMARK: Lenny said you... he said... Can’t remember what he said.\nRITA: Doctor, you’re going to mess this up for me.\nDOCTOR: Do you trust Lenny?\nMARK: I...\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t Lenny just want you to carry on with the group, no matter what?\nMARK: I'm not going back. I’ve had it with all that.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: You’re looking at all these old photographs, though.\nMARK: That’s not me in those pictures any more. It’s not us.\nDOCTOR: Mark... I just want to talk.\nMARK: Talk? I can talk all day.\nRITA: You can say that again. Doctor, can you put the milk and eggs in the fridge?\nDOCTOR: Where’s the kitchen?\nMARK: Just a fridge and a cooker, over there in the corner.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nRITA: Mark, it’s all good material this, but I think six days of tape is more than enough to fill four pages in Disc & Music Echo.\nMARK: It’s not going to be an interview. It’s going to be a book.\nRITA: A book?\nMARK: You’re going to write a book about how it really was.\nRITA: Don’t I get a say in this?\nMARK: Don’t you want to?\nRITA: Well... yeah.\nMARK: There you go then. People need to know how it really was.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: Why?\nMARK: People are still obsessed with us. They need to know the truth. See us with our trousers down. Then maybe they’1ll stop.\nMARK: SCENE 59. INT. TAXI — 1970\nJAMES: Do you miss it, Lenny?\nLENNY: Miss what?\nJAMES: New York.\nLENNY: Oh yeah, yeah. Like crazy. Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, yellow cabs — I ache for them. You know James, if he comes back we can still get a new single out for Christmas.\nJAMES: Christmas is in a month.\nLENNY: This is 1970. You can make a record in a week these days.\nJAMES: I don’t want to put pressure on him.\nLENNY: And I checked venues, you could do three shows in London, New York, Los Angeles —\nJAMES: What’s all the rush?\nLENNY: Rush? I’1ll1 tell you the rush — you won’t be young forever, and you won’t be on top of the world forever. And you gotta make the most of it while it’s still there.\nJAMES: I dunno. I mean, is there anything left for us to do?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 90\nLENNY: Oh yeah.\nJAMES: But we’ve conquered the world. Where else is there to go?\nJAMES: What’s funny?\nLENNY: Nothing.\nLENNY: SCENE 60. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nRITA: Mark? Where’s this one?\nMARK: Toyko, ‘66. And that’s Bahamas, '65.. Adelaide '64! You never saw anything like that. It’s all so... maybe I shouldn’t have gone...\nRITA: Everyone wants you to get the group back together.\nMARK: Korky doesn’t.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nMARK: He’s had it. Don’t blame him, putting up with James and me. Says he wants to be an actor.\nDOCTOR: Children’s television?\nMARK: I said that. He’d be great at that.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 91\nMARK: Oh man, look — this is the interview.\nRITA: I saw this when it was in the Standard. We just laughed when we read it in the office.\nMARK: Yanks didn’t like it. Not at all. What’s the diagnosis, Doc?\nDOCTOR: (READING) ‘Kids don’t go to church any more to feel part of something bigger, they come to our gigs. They listen to us when they want to know what’s what. I’m not saying they should but they do. It’s like we’re the new gods. We’ve got power over these kids because they listen to us and talk about us.’\nMARK: I didn’t say it to be big-headed, I just meant that’s how other people see us. But it came out a bit wrong, or it was taken wrong.\nDOCTOR: Rita.. I’m going to make some tea, could you help me please?\nRITA: Right.\nMARK: (OFF) Three sugars.\nRITA: Yes, I know.\nRITA: (LOW) What is it?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Something about that interview. Where are the matches?\nRITA: (LOW) Here.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 92\nRITA: (LOW) What about the interview? That was years ago.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) There’s something about the power of the group, the three of them together. If they split up, they’1ll never match what they were as a unit — creatively or in terms of popularity.\nRITA: (LOW) Of course not, that’s why Lenny wants to get them back together.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) They’re amplifying each others’ impact — but if they’ve split up.. there’s something more. This isn’t finished yet.\nRITA: (LOW) What do we do?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Don’t encourage him to get the band back together.\nRITA: (LOW) But that’s my story — our readers want the group to get back together.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Please, just go along with this.\nRITA: (LOW) All right.\nRITA: There you go.\nMARK: Cheers. These go right back — look at that one.\nDOCTOR: Good grief.\nRITA: What is it?\nMARK: Hamburg. A fan took this at the club. Can’t remember who that girl is, but Korky certainly took a shine to her — just look at his face!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 93\nRITA: What?\nDOCTOR: That must be where she went after she vanished at the airport.\nMARK: Nyssa! That’s right. Nice lass. Shy, but sweet.\nDOCTOR: What happened to her?\nMARK: Er... I don’t remember.\nDOCTOR: Please, Mark. This is important!\nMARK: Mate, I don’t remember. She just hung around the club for a night or two, she stayed in our room.. then she vanished. Korky never mentioned her again.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61. INT. CELLAR — 1960\nLENNY: Nice and tight, Sadie.\nSADIE: I can manage to tie a knot, Len.\nKORKY: Why are you helping him?\nSADIE: Cos I want to.\nNYSSA: You might think that, but he could be controlling your mind and you [wouldn’t even —]\nSADIE: He’s not controlling anything. I’m here because I love them.\nKORKY: Yeah, seems like it.\nSADIE: Oh, you don’t know what Lenny’s got planned yet.\nLENNY: Don’t tell him.\nSADIE: I wasn’t going to tell him. (TO KORKY) He found me at a gig.\nKORKY: That doesn’t narrow it down. You came to them all, even when we were useless.\nSADIE: You’ve always been great, and it made me angry when the other groups slagged you off. Then Lenny told me what he was going to do. He’s going to make you big.\nLENNY: Don’t tell him!\nSADIE: I’m not telling him the main bit.\nNYSSA: What are you getting out of it?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 95\nSADIE: I’m their number one fan. He’s seen the future. I’m going to follow them around the world and see everything they do, and Lenny’s going to pay for it.\nNYSSA: Yes, I experienced his time-travel equipment first hand. Rather primitive, I thought.\nLENNY: It does what I need it to do. What are you doing here?\nSADIE: Trying to get her nasty little claws into Korky.\nNYSSA: You must have a very short memory. I’m here because I got caught up in your time-travel equipment.\nLENNY: I don’t mean here as in Hamburg, I mean here as in Earth.\nNYSSA: Oh. I’m... visiting.\nLENNY: C’mon, gimme some credit. You’ve gotta be a Jude.\nKORKY: A jude?\nLENNY: An Adjudicator, a Jude. The cops, if you like.\nNYSSA: If you’re afraid I’m the police, you must be doing something illegal.\nKORKY: What, other than shooting at us?\nNYSSA: Something much worse than that. Something that’s illegal on his world, something they’d pursue him all the way here for.\nKORKY: Something to do with me? With the band? Is he from my world?\nLENNY: So, she told you you’re not human, did she?\nKORKY: That’s what she said.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 96\nSADIE: It doesn’t make any difference to me.\nLENNY: Cool it, sister.\nNYSSA: Yes, Korky: you’re from the same place as him. So are Mark and James. Did you bring them here, Lenny? Insert them into Earth’s history?\nLENNY: I’m gonna make these boys great.\nSADIE: They’re already great.\nLENNY: Greater than great. And you, young lady... are not gonna stop me. (TO SADIE) OK, wipe his memory.\nKORKY: What?\nLENNY: Sorry, can’t have you remembering any of this. You’ve gotta fit in here, and that means you can’t know what you really are... just yet, anyway.\nSADIE: Hold still.\nKORKY: No!\nNYSSA: You can’t do this to him!\nLENNY: Of course I can. He’s mine.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nDOCTOR: Mark, is this the only picture of her? Of Nyssa?\nMARK: Like I say, she was only there one or two nights. Oh, that’s a great pic — Abbey Road, '66.. or could be '’67...\nRITA: And he never mentioned her again?\nMARK: Not that I remember. Funny, cos Korks seemed smitten with her...\nDOCTOR: Logically... that could be because I went back, or will go back, and pick her up.\nMARK: Go back?\nRITA: He’s a time traveller.\nMARK: (LAUGHS) Sure. Blackpool Big Night Out, ‘65. Shea Stadium, '65...\nRITA: That must be it. You found her, and maybe Korky saw you take her away in the TARDIS, and he never said anything because he didn’t think the others would believe it.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Unless... I don’t get back there and save her. And something else gets her.\nMARK: Cavern, ‘61... Amsterdam, ' 64...\nRITA: Then you have to go and find her. Now. Before something else does.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, I want to, but it won’t make any difference. That’s the nature of time travel. Before I go, I need to [ensure that\nDOCTOR: —]\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 98\nBOTH: NOTICE.\nMARK: Morecambe '62.. Stockholm '63...\nRITA: Doctor... what’s wrong with him?\nMARK: London ‘65.. London '’67...\nDOCTOR: Mark...? Are you all right?\nMARK: Give me the photograph.\nDOCTOR: But it’s the only one of Nyssa —\nMARK: I need it!\nDOCTOR: Why?\nMARK: I need all of them!\nDOCTOR: Ahh!\nDOCTOR: Oof!\nRITA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’m all right. Just hit my head on the cooker.\nRITA: He knocked you halfway across the room.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 99\nMARK: Pictures... from here to there, from then to now... a web running through the years and across the world...\nRITA: He doesn’t even sound like himself.\nDOCTOR: Something’s taking him over... or something that’s been submerged is breaking through...\nMARK: New strength!\nDOCTOR: He’s drawing energy from the photographs.\nRITA: How?\nDOCTOR: Just as he said, the images form a web, recording moments in his life. But where’s the power coming from?\nRITA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Energy has to come from somewhere. He’s using the photos to access it, but...\nRITA: (SICKLY) He seems like he’s... growing...\nDOCTOR: Rita? Are you all right?\nRITA: I don’t feel... quite...\nMARK: Millions upon millions upon millions of people, every day seeing my face, hearing my voice, reading about me, writing about me, talking about me, thinking about me...\nDOCTOR: No. No! Stop!\nRITA: What is it?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: That’s where the energy is coming from — the people who’ve seen these images. His fans. That was the point all along — to make him famous. All three of them.\nRITA: What’s going to happen to me?\nDOCTOR: (TO MARK) Mark. Can’t you hear me? Stop this now!\nRITA: Doctor?\nVOICE: IS LOUDER, DEEPER.\nMARK: It cannot be stopped!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/01\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63. EXT. STREET — 1970\nDOCTOR WHO: OF A TAXI. A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY, SOME CAMPED-OUT FANS NOTICE\nHIM AND MURMUR: ‘IT CAN’T BE,’ ‘YEAH — IT’S JAMES!’ ‘WHY’S HE HERE?’\nLENNY: Keep the change.\nJAMES: Lenny, look — he’s still got the fans camping outside.\nLENNY: He’1ll still have the fans camping outside when he’s sixty-four, James. And so will you.\nJAMES: Will the fans be sixty-four too?\nJAMES: Evening, ladies — or is it afternoon?\nLENNY: Gimme a minute, I’m gonna talk to them.\nJAMES: (OFF) OK.\nLENNY: (TO SADIE) Sadie! How’s it going?\nSADIE: I left the box of stuff outside the apartment. Don’t know if he took it in.\nLENNY: Couldn’t you put it in his hands?\nSADIE: He’s not answering the door. To anybody.\nLENNY: This better work. We’re so close...\nSADIE: You've been saying that since 1964.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 102\nLENNY: I know, but these last few years with me in control... it’s all been so tight. Nothing bad’s getting out — even when they split, I kept a lid on it all. It’s gotta happen soon.\nLENNY: SCENE 64. INT. CELLAR — 1960\nNYSSA: The Doctor won’t let you do this.\nLENNY: Doctor?\nNYSSA: He knows something’s wrong. He’s onto you, and he’1l put it right.\nLENNY: He the guy who told the boys to duck down at the airport?\nNYSSA: Yes.\nLENNY: He did me a favour. (TO SADIE) OK, this is done.\nSADIE: How do you know you’ve erased the right bits of his memory?\nLENNY: I wiped a good chunk of it just to be sure... anything else, we put down to drink.\nNYSSA: Why did you shoot at the band?\nLENNY: It got headlines. People took the boys more seriously, wanted to protect them more. Less than a month later, they shot the President and people were saying maybe it was the same guy who shot at The Common Men. That broke America for us.\nNYSSA: You’ve been hopping about in time, manipulating things all along. Sooner or later you’1ll tie yourself in a knot.\nLENNY: Even if I do.. you won’t be there to take advantage.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nDOCTOR WHO: ANIMAL, BUT IT IS HYSTERICAL.\nMARK: I remember. I remember everything...\nRITA: Doctor, I can’t... I can’t see.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Rita, it’s all right. I’1ll find a way, I'll reverse his power.\nRITA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: You don’t want to know. But he’s between us and the door — just hang on, if I can get you to the TARDIS I’m sure I can... do something for you.\nMARK: She is tied to me by her words... I will take all of her.\nDOCTOR: Why are you doing this?\nMARK: Wouldn’t you, if you could?\nDOCTOR: No!\nMARK: Feeble.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. INT. STAIRWELL — 1970\nJAMES: Leave the talking to me, Lenny.\nLENNY: Whatever you say, James.\nJAMES: In fact, perhaps you should stay out here.\nLENNY: Why?\nJAMES: You can be a bit abrasive.\nLENNY: So can he.\nJAMES: Yeah, but he’s Mark Carville and you’re not, so he gets away WEth: 2b).\nLENNY: I’ll be quiet, I’1ll be low-key, I’11 give the situation whatever it needs.\nJAMES: OK.\nJAMES: DOOR.\nJAMES: He’d better be in, after all —\nLENNY: Shh — listen.\nJAMES: (BEAT) What is that?\nLENNY: We gotta get in there.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 105\nJAMES: What’s going on?\nLENNY: Something big. But why now...?\nJAMES: You know, don’t you? What’s going on?\nLENNY: Ah, nuts to this.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67. INT. APARTMENT — 1970\nJAMES: What the —\nLENNY: It’s Mark.\nJAMES: What?\nMARK: You!\nDOCTOR: James, be careful!\nJAMES: That’s Mark?\nMARK: You came here to take from me again, like you always do.\nJAMES: No! I didn’t want to come at all, he made me — Lenny!\nLENNY: I’1ll handle this — James, maybe you should go [and I'll —-]\nMARK: No! He stays.\nLENNY: Mark, this is good. It’s what I’ve always wanted for you — but I wanted it for all three of you.\nJAMES: You wanted this?\nDOCTOR: What is he?\nLENNY: Do you remember now? Home?\nMARK: Yes.. I forgot, for a long time. But now I remember.\nLENNY: All our people can become this powerful, if we get the adulation of the masses.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: All you need is love?\nLENNY: But the people in charge, they don’t like us doing it. They say is changes us, gives us a thirst for more power, domination — but this is our true nature. That’s what they’re denying. That’s why they banned photographs, anything that records...\nDOCTOR: So you came here.\nLENNY: We’re dopes. We ought to be using our power. We can travel in time, manipulate the vortex — but we never even leave our own planet.\nDOCTOR: And so you’re turning this planet into a giant battery to power your monsters.\nJAMES: By making us famous?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (TO LENNY) But you made them famous, instead of yourself. You stay in the background. Why?\nLENNY: I’m an orchestrator. My place is behind the scenes.\nDOCTOR: Mark, he’s afraid of this power. He wants you to wield it for him, he wants to control you!\nMARK: I don’t take orders from no-one. Not Lenny, not James. Never again.\nJAMES: I never gave you orders.\nRITA: D... Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Hold on, Rita, hold on.\nMARK: ; You gave everyone orders.\nJAMES: Someone had to, man. It wasn’t holding together on its own.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 108\nMARK: Nine hours I spent recording a guitar solo. Nine hours. You listened to every take and told me we’d almost got it right.\nJAMES: Mate —\nMARK: And then you came in early the next day and did it yourself in twenty minutes.\nJAMES: I just did what was for the good of the group. More than you ever did.\nMARK: What?\nJAMES: When Korky wrote a song, you never even came in to work on it with us. You never helped him.\nMARK: Don’t bring him into this.\nJAMES: Why am I asking you to come back to the group? You only ever think of yourself anyway.\nLENNY: No!\nLENNY: What the hell did you just do?\nDOCTOR: Killed him. And he used the last of Rita’s strength to do it. She’s dead.\nLENNY: No! I needed all three. The Triumvirate — that’s how it worked in the old days. Three of you linked, working together would’ve been unstoppable. You weren’t meant to do this!\nMARK: I’1l do what I like.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 109\nLENNY: No! I did this to you.\nMARK: And you can take it away?\nLENNY: I can. Absolutely I can. You need the people of this world, if they turn against [you —]\nMARK: Then I should destroy you too.\nLENNY: Woah, woah —\nMARK: So long, and thanks for all the cash.\nLENNY: Sorry, Doctor, but —\nMARK: So now it’s just the two of us.\nDOCTOR: Mark, listen. You don’t want to destroy me —\nMARK: I do though.\nDOCTOR: No, I can help —\nMARK: I don’t want to be helped. I just want to burn everything that refuses to be mine.\nDOCTOR: Mark, please!\nMARK: And I’m going to start with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/10"

CELLAR — 1960\nLENNY: (EXCITED) You got them to ascend?\nANOTHER LENNY: Woah, woah, woah. Only Mark, and it didn’t work out.\nSADIE: What d’you mean, didn’t work out?\nANOTHER LENNY: It took longer than I thought. The group had already split up.\nSADIE: You can’t let them split up. Get them back together.\nANOTHER LENNY: That’s gonna be a little difficult. After Mark ascended he killed James.\nLENNY: (BEAT) Oh.\nANOTHER LENNY: So we've got to change history.\nSADIE: Again?\nANOTHER LENNY: Yeah, again. We got to keep the group together and get them to ascend together.\nLENNY: How come it took so long? We had ten years.\nANOTHER LENNY: Hey, I did everything I could. Every step of the way I had to get the hysteria going, get people talking, get people listening to their music. Then I took control myself, stopped any bad press getting out. Couldn’t have done more.\nLENNY: But we had the whole template, everything that made The Beatles famous. Everything except the songs.\nANOTHER LENNY: You got Korky here?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/16\nSADIE: Yeah, we’ve just been wiping his memory.\nANOTHER LENNY: Perfect. You’ve got to put it into his head what’s going to happen when the group splits up, and what he’s got to do about it. He’s gotta be the buffer between Mark and James, right?\nSADIE: And that’1ll work? That’ll keep them together?\nANOTHER LENNY: If not, we try something else. We’ve got nothing but time.\nANOTHER LENNY: SCENE 72. EXT. STREET — 1960\nDOCTOR: I don’t know where they’ve come from. But they are alien.\nNYSSA: I know.\nDOCTOR: You know?\nNYSSA: It’s obvious if you know what you’re looking for.\nDOCTOR: Oh. I see. Well, they derive power from being known of. The more people who meet them, who see pictures of them, who hear their voices, who read about them — that all creates a web which enables them to draw energy from those people.\nNYSSA: So their power comes from being famous.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. So they travelled here and found the most famous people they could — people whose music and image has been replicated around the globe. The fact they write and perform the music themselves strengthens the effect — the whole package is bound up with their personalities. It wouldn’t work as well with, say, Elvis.\nNYSSA: Who’s Elvis?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: I’ll explain later. There’s also something to do with them being a group — Lenny mentioned a triumvirate.\nNYSSA: Why can’t Lenny do this himself?\nDOCTOR: I think there’s some personal risk involved and he wants someone else to take it. He seems to think he can control them.\nNYSSA: This is it.\nDOCTOR: The Pfannkuchen?\nNYSSA: Now I understand, it means ‘Doughnut’!\nDOCTOR: Of course, you’ve been stuck here without the TARDIS to translate the language.\nNYSSA: I was starting to pick up some German. It seems very logical. I rather like it.\nDOCTOR: And I like doughnuts. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. INT. CELLAR — 1960\nANOTHER LENNY: It’s done.\nSADIE: Will it work?\nANOTHER LENNY: I’m gonna go back to 1970 and find that out, Sadie.\nLENNY: (OFF) Yeah, get out of here. I’m getting sick of the sound of my voice.\nANOTHER LENNY: Ain't I full of charm today. OK, I’m going.\nSTARTS: WALKING OVER.\nLENNY: (OFF) Let’s see if we can bring Korky round.\nSADIE: Right. How do we explain how he ended up down here?\nLENNY: Does he have any cash on him?\nSADIE: Yes, a few deutschmarks.\nLENNY: Take them and tell him someone robbed him down here. If he remembers Nyssa, we'll say she did it.\nSADIE: You know, I could keep women like her away from him permanently if you’d let me —\nLENNY: Sorry, but no. I need you working out there with the other fans. You’re my focal point.\nSADIE: Aw.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/19\nLENNY: Don’t give me that [face —]\nSADIE: What’s that?\nLENNY: Huh. It’s... my communicator.\nSADIE: Who’s calling you?\nLENNY: Don’t say the Judes found me. Not when I’m so close... You answer ah ee\nSADIE: What?\nLENNY: If it’s Judes, play dumb. Say... you found the communicator.\nSADIE: No.\nLENNY: Do it!\nSADIE: All right, all right.\nLENNY: Hit that switch there.\nSADIE: Er, yes? Hello?\nCOMMANDER: (D) We’re looking for the Emperor Paternis.\nLENNY: (TO HIMSELF) Emperor?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 120\nSADIE: I don’t know who you mean.\nCOMMANDER: (D) His name is Klyneln. His future self sent us to assist him.\nLENNY: Future self?\nCOMMANDER: (D) Yes.\nSADIE: What does it mean?\nLENNY: It means it worked. It means we won.\nLENNY: SCENE 74. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1960\nLENNY: TO A TABLE WHERE MARK AND JAMES ARE SITTING.\nDOCTOR: Mark! James! Good to see you.\nMARK: Have we met?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Good point. Not yet.\nNYSSA: This is the Doctor.\nJAMES: Oh! Your friend! He turned up, then.\nMARK: Nyssa, have you seen Korky?\nNYSSA: He’s in trouble, I’m afraid.\nJAMES: Oh lord, has he set fire to the bunk again?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/21\nDOCTOR: Not that sort of trouble. This is going to sound odd, but... you’re not human.\nJAMES: Eh?\nDOCTOR: The three of you. None of you are.\nMARK: (LAUGHS) What? I see now why you didn’t get my jokes, Nyssa — I was being too subtle. Not human!\nGROWING: LOUDER.\nDOCTOR: I wish there was some evidence I could [show —]\nNYSSA: Doctor — what’s that noise...?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It sounds like...\nJAMES: What?\nMARK: Is it a plane?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) No. I’m afraid it’s not. Outside, quick!\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75. EXT. STREET — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: NEARING. PEOPLE IN THE STREET ARE PANICKING, RUNNING AWAY.\nNYSSA: It’s a spaceship, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Capable of space and time travel, I think.\nNYSSA: But the amount of energy to transport a ship that size —\nDOCTOR: Colossal. Yes. So whoever we’re dealing with, they’re that sort of people.\nNYSSA: What do they want?\nDOCTOR: Let’s ask them. (CLEARS THROAT: SHOUTS) Excuse me? What do you want?\nDOCTOR: THE CLUB.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 76. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1960\nMARK: What in the [name of —]\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, but clearly they came here to get rid of Nyssa and myself.\nJAMES: Why?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, but in my experience if people are trying to kill you, you’re usually doing something right.\nMARK: What are they?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR: Well spaceships, obviously. Should’ve been careful what I wished for.\nBARMAN: (OFF; GERMAN ACCENT) Hello, the Pfannkuchen? (PAUSE; THEN CALLS) Is there anyone here called ‘the Doktor’?\nDOCTOR: That’s me.\nDOCTOR: Hello?\nLENNY: (D) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Where did those ships come from, Lenny?\nLENNY: (D) The future. A future where I won.\nDOCTOR: What?\nLENNY: (D) And my boys are the most powerful beings the galaxy has ever seen, and we got a whole empire and the kind of firepower you just saw out there.\nDOCTOR: I see. Did you just phone me to boast?\nLENNY: (D) No, I phoned to tell you to get out of there. And don’t even think about harming Mark and James.\nDOCTOR: I hadn’t. They’re entirely innocent in all this, aren’t they?\nLENNY: (D) You won’t hurt them because they’re innocent. Right, that’s interesting to know.\nDOCTOR: I notice your ships have stopped shooting. They don’t want to hit Mark and James, do they?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 124\nLENNY: (D) My troops can beam in and get you.\nDOCTOR: But they haven’t yet, which means we must be beyond the range of their transmats.\nLENNY: (D) Dream on, wiseguy.\nDOCTOR: So that buys us a couple of minutes. Thank you.\nJAMES: A couple of minutes to do what?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Is there a back way out of here?\nNYSSA: That ship managed to target you from over a mile away. They’1l find you before you reach the TARDIS.\nMARK: We might be better off barricading the door, stopping them coming in.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Why the rush to get us out? He knows I won't harm you, and we can’t live on lager and peanuts forever.\nMARK: We can try.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) There is a way out. And he’s afraid I'll work it out if he leaves me here long enough.\nNYSSA: Then you’d better hurry.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Does anyone know when this club was built?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77. EXT. STREET — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: WALK. SPACESHIP HOVERING IN SKY ABOVE.\nLENNY: How’s our boy, Sadie?\nSADIE: Heavy.\nKORKY: (GROGGY) I’ve got to get to the gig.\nLENNY: Easy. The gig’s not till tonight.\nKORKY: Who are you?\nLENNY: Nobody you know.\nSADIE: HELPING KORKY\nSADIE: I can’t believe that thing’s really up there.\nLENNY: Believe it, baby. And it’s all mine.\nLENNY: OK, send a squad of guys down as soon as you're in range. Twenty should do it. Get in there and bring the Doctor and his\nLENNY: friend out.\nCOMMANDER: (D) Understood.\nCOMMANDER: TO\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1960\nDOCTOR WHO: SOMETHING.\nNYSSA: What are you looking for?\nDOCTOR: Controls.\nJAMES: Controls for what?\nMARK: He’s flipped.\nJAMES: If he’s flipped so have I. That thing out there’s definitely a spaceship.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) I suggest you all leave. Whatever happens, this isn’t going to be a good place to be.\nJAMES: Us too?\nDOCTOR: No, you stay here. Now... back rooms.\nBARMAN: (CALLS) Hey! Private, no entry!\nDOCTOR: I said everyone — out of here!\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT. BACK ROOM — 1960\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on...\nDOCTOR: Aha!\nMARK: What the hel1ll1...?\nMARK: LIFE.\nDOCTOR: Pretty basic, but they should be able to get us out of here.\nDOCTOR: SHUDDER.\nDOCTOR: James, make sure anyone who hasn’t left the building does so immediately, will you?\nJAMES: Right.\nMARK: The club is a spaceship too?\nDOCTOR: The spaceship Lenny used to bring you to Earth, with a bit of surface remodelling. A perfect disguise.\nNYSSA: I’1ll bet there’s equipment here that’s been amplifying the hysteria.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Lenny’s been boosting enthusiasm for the group, and if necessary he uses the crowd as a weapon.\nMARK: You’re saying it’s not us they’re reacting to? Just this guy’s machines?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: It was always there, but he was enhancing it.\nMARK: So we’re not that good, then?\nDOCTOR: You’re good. Just not as good as the real thing, that’s all.\nMARK: Oh.\nDOCTOR: Lenny clearly thinks he can just slot anyone into The Beatles’ place in history and get the same result. But he is mistaken. You can’t replicate that perfect combination of talents and personalities, who came together at the right moment in history to create something marvellous. The problem with people who try to engineer history is they don’t appreciate the wonder of sheer happenstance.\nJAMES: The place is clear now.\nDOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone.\nNYSSA: Hold tight onto what?\nDOCTOR: Anything. Each other, if you can’t find anything else. Here goes...\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80. EXT. STREET — 1960\nLENNY: Dammit!\nSADIE: Oh my god...\nKORKY: I don’t think I’m quite right. It looks like the club’s sort Of. Lifting Up.\nCOMMANDER: (D) Do I open fire?\nLENNY: No! The boys are in there. Are you in transmat range yet?\nCOMMANDER: (D) Just coming into range now.\nLENNY: Good. Bring me aboard, cloak the ship and catch up with them.\nLENNY: SCENE 81. INT. BACK ROOM — 1960\nJAMES: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Away from here. Liverpool?\nMARK: Sounds good.\nDOCTOR: I wonder what else is on board this thing? There must be a communicator... and logically, the genetic modelling equipment he used to create your flesh-suits will be here too.\nNYSSA: Is there anything we can use to stop Lenny?\nDOCTOR: As long as we’ve got Mark and James, his plan won’t work. If I can work out how to operate this ship’s time-travel capacity, we could get them away from here.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 130\nNYSSA: What about Korky?\nDOCTOR: We'll have to do something about him later. If I take them out of the timelines altogether I [can —]\nDOCTOR: MACHINE.\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Someone’s trying to board us with a transmat. I’m going to speed up and see if I can stop him getting a lock on us...\nMARK: He’s vanishing...\nJAMES: Nice one, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And I think I’ve located the controls for the time-travel [capability —]\nGOES: VERY STILL.\nNYSSA: Tractor beam!\nMARK: What does that mean?\nNYSSA: We can’t move, we’re suspended in the air.\nDOCTOR: I’ll see if I can still use the time-travel —\nLENNY: OK, give it up now.\nMARK: If you think we’re coming with you —\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/31\nLENNY: You are coming with me. And not just because I’ve got a gun.\nJAMES: The Doctor’s told us about you.\nLENNY: I’m sure he has. That’s why I’m going to wipe your memories and make you forget about it.\nMARK: You can’t just —\nLENNY: OK, stop talking now.\nJAMES: Bu- (HE STAMMERS, UNABLE TO FORM WORDS)\nDOCTOR: Subliminal suggestion?\nLENNY: They do what I say.\nDOCTOR: But you can’t do it remotely, can you? Only in person. Otherwise you’d never have come here yourself, would you?\nLENNY: What’s that supposed to mean?\nDOCTOR: You’re a coward.\nLENNY: Right.\nDOCTOR: You clearly are. You don’t want this power for yourself, because you’re afraid of it, afraid of what it’1ll do to you — so you’re giving it to people you can control.\nLENNY: Believe what you like.\nNYSSA: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 132\nNYSSA: If Mark and James have gone —\nDOCTOR: I know, I know! I think I’ve got the hang of these controls —\nNYSSA: They could fire on us any moment!\nDOCTOR: Then let’s hope I’ve got it right!\nDOCTOR: LOUDER, BIGGER VERSION OF THE NOISE OF LENNY’S TIME MACHINE.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 82. EXT. STREET — 1960\nDOCTOR: JAMES.\nLENNY: And I’m back.\nSADIE: You got Mark and James!\nLENNY: No sweat.\nSADIE: Are they OK?\nMARK: Yeah.\nJAMES: Yeah.\nSADIE: Lenny, they don’t seem OK.\nLENNY: I’m just keeping them calm until I can wipe their memories.\nSADIE: What about the Doctor and Nyssa?\nLENNY: Oh, they’re gone. (BEAT) Gonna have to find a new venue for the gig tonight.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83. INT. PFANNKUCHEN CLUB — 1966\nNYSSA: Doctor — you did it!\nDOCTOR: Don’t congratulate me just yet, Nyssa...\nNYSSA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: Suddenly getting free of the tractor beam is playing havoc with the flight controls. But don’t worry, I think I can land us in the —\nNYSSA: FALL TO THE GROUND.\nDOCTOR: — sea.\nNYSSA: When are we?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure how this read-out works...\nDOCTOR: Er... 1966? Sometime in the summer... I think it’s June. I should steer clear of London in case I bump into myself.\nNYSSA: What now?\nDOCTOR: We need to take Lenny out of the equation somehow.\nNYSSA: But he’s so powerful now.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s use his power against himself. Lenny’s obsessed with avoiding bad press. He closes it down very aggressively.\nNYSSA: You think it’s got something to do with how their power works?\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: He said something to Mark about turning the people of this world against them. Perhaps negativity has the opposite effect.\nNYSSA: Could we use it to de-power The Common Men?\nDOCTOR: That’s a tall order. It would take a lot to put a dent in their popularity. (BEAT) But I’ve got another idea. Which glass was James drinking out of?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 84. EXT. STREET — 1970\nDOCTOR: FROM A ROOFTOP. THE COMMON MEN ARE PLAYING A GIG.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) Thank you!\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) It’s good to be back... now our next number is going to be the A-side of our next single.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) Is it?\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) Yeah.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) I thought it was going to be my one?\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) That’s the B-side.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) Really?\nKORKY: (OFF; ECHO) We’re going to split up again in a minute.\nSADIE: This is great.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 135\nLENNY: Yeah.\nSADIE: Do you have to take them away?\nLENNY: Sorry. Nothing lasts forever, kid.\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) Right — we’ve got back together... but we’ve got a problem with tuning up.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) It’s the cold, I can’t grip the keys.\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) Give us a minute, folks.\nDOCTOR: Enjoying the show?\nLENNY: You!\nSADIE: What’s he doing here?\nLENNY: Don’t panic, Sadie, don’t panic. (TO DOCTOR) My ships are cloaked, Doctor, still up in orbit. They can destroy you any time.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure they can.\nLENNY: All I have to do is give the word. Nobody would know it had anything to do with me — it’d look like you died of a heart attack.\nDOCTOR: Very impressive. (BEAT) I’ve got someone to give the word to well, you know.\nSADIE: What?\nLENNY: He’s bluffing.\nLENNY: as\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR: Am I? How interesting.\nSADIE: Kill him. He’s annoying.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa is monitoring this, poised to put our plan into action as soon as I give the word — or as soon as you kill me, whichever happens sooner. Unless you give up.\nSADIE: Just like that?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Give up on your plan and tell me how to release the time lock you put on 1957.\nLENNY: What are you going to do if I don’t?\nDOCTOR: I can’t tell you.\nLENNY: You can’t expect me to give up without even knowing what you’re threatening me with.\nDOCTOR: But if I told you, you might find a way around it.\nLENNY: OK, this is just dumb. I ain’t giving up. You got nothing.\nJAMES: (OFF; ECHO) And we’re back. Sorry, we’ve only had ten years in the business, we’re still learning.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. I’d hoped I wouldn’t have to do this.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Go ahead.\nNYSSA: (D) Right, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 137\nMARK: (OFF; ECHO) As we were saying half an hour ago, this is the A- Side of our next single...\nLENNY: And when will we see this plan of yours come to fruition?\nDOCTOR: Oh, here they come.\nDOCTOR: PUZZLED.\nJAMES: (D) Wait up — the rozzers are here...\nLENNY: What?\nPOLICEMAN: Mr Leonard Kruger?\nLENNY: Yeah?\nPOLICEMAN: I’m arresting you for the murder of James O’Meara.\nLENNY: What? He’s right up there!\nPOLICEMAN: You have the right to remain silent...\nLENNY: You did this. You — the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I didn’t do anything.\nPOLICEMAN: You have the right to —\nLENNY: It was her! Not me.\nSADIE: What?\nPOLICEMAN: The evidence we have puts you at the scene, Mr Kruger. Now we need you to [come with —]\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 138\nLENNY: Back off!\nDOCTOR: Look out!\nLENNY: I still got my fleet.\nLENNY: (TO COMM) Take them out. The police, the crowd, everyone!\nLENNY: Respond. Come on!\nDOCTOR: They’re gone. We’re on a different track of history now.\nLENNY: I’1l undo it. Whatever you did, I’1l1 go back —\nSADIE: The time machine!\nDOCTOR: lS out of batteries. I told Korky how to remove them.\nPOLICEMAN: Can you stop with the weird stuff, sir, and get in the back of the van [please]?\nDOCTOR: No! You didn’t have to kill him.\nLENNY: Nobody try to follow me! (HE RUNS OFF)\nDOCTOR: Don’t let him get away!

Are you still in the club?\nNYSSA: Yes, in Hyde Park. The radio news has got hold of the story.\nDOCTOR: (D) Thanks to Rita. She said she’d use every contact she had.\nNYSSA: What can I do?\nDOCTOR: (D) Help me look for Lenny.\nNYSSA: Aren’t the police doing that?\nDOCTOR: (D) It might be useful if I could get to him first. I’d hoped he might come quietly, but no luck.\nNYSSA: Maybe I could [come and —] [SHE’S CLUBBED ON THE HEAD BY SADIE]\nDOCTOR: (D) Nyssa?\nSADIE: I’ve got your friend.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 87.

RADIO BROADCAST — 1970\nRITA: It’s hard to believe what Lenny Kruger’s pulled off here. He fooled everyone. I’ve interviewed the Common Men before and after September 1966 and I didn’t know. But yeah, it’s true. They’re going to make a statement about it soon.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 1/41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 90. EXT. STREET — 1970\nDOCTOR WHO: TALKIE.\nDOCTOR: Sadie, listen to me. Lenny has already lost.\nSADIE: (D) Says you.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and I’m right. Being venerated and adored makes his people strong, being hated makes them weak. The news will be spreading across the world — the world believes he killed James. Very soon he will die — but first I have to find him.\nSADIE: (D) Why? What do you care whether he lives or dies?\nDOCTOR: I’ve stopped him making his monsters, but now I need to undo what he did. The world can’t be like this.\nSADIE: (D) I like it like this.\nDOCTOR: Please, Sadie!\nSADIE: (D) Stop looking for him or I’11 kill your friend.\nDOCTOR: You think that’1ll do any good?\nSADIE: (D) What will do any good now?\nDOCTOR: Undoing what he did. Don’t you see? None of this will ever have happened. You can live a whole new life. (BEAT) Or be an accessory to James' murder.\nSADIE: (D) But I'm not —\nDOCTOR: The evidence is there.

PRESS CONFERENCE — 1970\nJAMES: I was hired to take James’ place in September 1966, and was immediately sent for plastic surgery. But y’see they told me it was an accident. We hadn’t even met Lenny then. It’s very weird, y’know, having had him working for us all this time, knowing what... they say he’s done.\nJAMES: SCENE 92. INT. BASEMENT FLAT — 1970\nNEWSREADER: 1:\nNEWSREADER: (D) ..other members of the Common Men, Mark Carville and Korky Goldsmith, have admitted they knew their bandmate had been replaced by a lookalike, but had been told the real James O’Meara had suffered a nervous breakdown and gone to a private Sanatorium in New Mexico.\nNEWSREADER: COUPLE OF TRIES, THEN HE ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: There you are!\nLENNY: Don’t... don’t come any closer.\nDOCTOR: If you kill me, you kill yourself. This story about you is unstoppable now.\nLENNY: It’s not true.\nDOCTOR: I know. But it’s very convincing. Nyssa and I used the genetic refashioning technology on your ship to create a lifeless dummy of James. Then we traced the rumours about James being dead back to their source and made them seem true.\nLENNY: And you got the boys to lie for you.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR: When they found out what you had planned... Your whole history is a lie, anyway. All fudged and pushed into position for your benefit — and it’s a pale copy of the real thing, a soulless cover version of history.\nLENNY: I’l1ll get lawyers... all I gotta do is... ride it out...\nDOCTOR: Look at you, Lenny. You’1ll be dead within a day. The news is only just reaching America. Even if the truth comes out, it’ll be too late for you. Give me the key for your time lock. I’1l go back, undo what you did, and...\nLENNY: None of this will have happened.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nLENNY: (BEAT) I’m proud of what I did. This was a huge operation, and I did it almost alone... just me and some schoolkid I picked up in Liverpool... and I almost made it. Almost. And if I give you that code I won’t even remember it.\nDOCTOR: You won’t remember anything at all if you don’t.\nLENNY: (BEAT) You’ve got a point.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 93.

His real name’s (POSH VOICE) Aubrey, don’t you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: He’s looking for a new image, a new sound. He wants a Merseybeat group to back him.\nMARK: Cashing in on The Beatles.\nKORKY: So’s everyone.\nJAMES: Ah well. If you can’t beatle them, join-le them!\nJAMES: SCENE 94. EXT. STREET — 1963\nJAMES: IN DISTANCE, GROWING CLOSER AS THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA APPROACH.\nDOCTOR: I knew the name was familiar. Susan had one of their records. She used to play it in the TARDIS. I didn’t like it.. but I was so much older then.\nNYSSA: But if things have only just changed now, how could you have heard their record back then?\nDOCTOR: This was how things always were. But this was the moment I was supposed to set things on that path.\nNYSSA: So it was always going to turn out this way?\nDOCTOR: Not if we’d made a hash of it, no. History would have been wrong forever and Lenny’s army would have run riot. But now history is as it always was, Lenny was always supposed to bring the Common Men here... and he was always supposed to get caught by his own people, thanks to our tip-off, and hauled off home.\nNYSSA: But they didn’t take Mark, James and Korky?\nDOCTOR: They don’t know they’re here. Using time travel technology is an offence in itself, and Lenny’s not owning up to bringing anyone with him.\nNYSSA: I thought the Common Men might prefer to go back to Bional.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR: I think they’1ll have more fun here. Did you see the chart? They’ve just gone in at number thirty-four. In three weeks it’ll peak at number two.\nNYSSA: Is that good?\nDOCTOR: Very good. Any other time they’d have a decent shot at number one, but it’s occupied by someone else at the moment.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 95. INT. PRINCE OF WALES THEATRE — 1963\nDOCTOR: They’re on next.\nNYSSA: Oh good.\nDOCTOR: Not enjoying it so far?\nNYSSA: I just... don’t really understand a lot of it.\nRITA: I know, it’s a bit naff. But it’1l be worth it for The Beatles.\nDOCTOR: Are you here to review the show?\nRITA: No, just to see it. Why?\nDOCTOR: Just thought you might be a music writer.\nRITA: (FLATTERED) Oh. Really?\nDOCTOR: Here they come!\nDOCTOR: END\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 147\nFANFARE: FOR THE COMMON MEN - SONGS\nFANFARE: Song #1: Who Is That Man\nFANFARE: This should be upbeat and pacy, a breezy skiffle-type dance number. A combination of ‘T Saw Her Standing There’ and ‘Twist and Shout’ by The Beatles and ‘Foot Tapper’ by The Shadows. We need only this opening part of the song.\nFANFARE: Well, Who is that man\nFANFARE: The man who has a plan.\nFANFARE: See the danger in his eyes? It’ll twist your soul away\nFANFARE: So don’t you listen to his lies Or he’ll turn your night to day.\nFANFARE: He says: ‘Who are you?’\nFANFARE: ‘T’m the girl that you love.’ You say: ‘Who are you?’\nFANFARE: ‘I’m the man from up above.’\nFANFARE: Song #2: Just Count To Three\nFANFARE: This should have a bit of a bounce to it. A combination of ‘From Me To You’ by The Beatles and ‘Dance On’ by The Shadows. We only need the end part of the song.\nFANFARE: When the time comes to be true When the time comes just be you I'll fly to you\nFANFARE: From out the blue\nFANFARE: You'll know it’s me\nFANFARE: Just count to three\nFANFARE: To one, to two, to three.\nFANFARE: You'll know it’s me Just count to three To one, to two, to three.\nDOCTOR WHO: FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MEN by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR WHO: Song #3: Oh Won't You Please Love Me?\nDOCTOR WHO: A driving rhythm to and plenty of Hank Marvin-style guitar. A combination of ‘I Wanna Hold Your Hand’ by The Beatles and ‘Apache’ by The Shadows. We need the whole song.\nDOCTOR WHO: Hey girl\nDOCTOR WHO: You are the one\nDOCTOR WHO: That’s all I have to say\nDOCTOR WHO: My love\nDOCTOR WHO: Burns like the sun\nDOCTOR WHO: I’ll blow your world away!\nDOCTOR WHO: Oh won't you please love me?

Oh won't you please love me?\nDOCTOR WHO: Beneath this skin There’s another me Just let me in\nDOCTOR WHO: You'll be sure to see How much\nDOCTOR WHO: You mean\nDOCTOR WHO: To me.\nDOCTOR WHO: Oh won't you please love me?
