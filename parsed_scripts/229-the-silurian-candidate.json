Unfortunately.\nACE: His loose ends are all about half-finished battles with old enemies: Daleks, Cybermen, Fenric.\nMEL: What’s a Fenric?\nACE: You need to be on your guard when he starts behaving like this. Things could get dangerous.\nMEL: That’s always true when you’re around the Doctor. Danger’s his middle name. Or possibly his first or last name. I can’t believe I’ve never asked him about that, actually.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 3\nACE: Whatever you ask him now, you won’t get an answer. That’s not who the Doctor is now. He’s a lot more secretive. Maybe he always was, and you just didn’t notice because, well...\nMEL: Because what?\nACE: Because he was being secretive.\nMEL: There was a time in Pompeii.

In the meantime, I’m trying to get the Karlas to function properly.\nRUTH: Don’t tell me you don’t approve of female-gendered robot soldiers.\nGORRISTER: I don’t approve of anything we’re doing on this mission, Professor.\nRUTH: That’s the difference between you and me. I don’t see this as a mission. It’s just something I have to do, so I’m doing it.\nGORRISTER: Sounds like a mission to me. One that’d have Chairman Falco tearing his wig off if he knew about it.\nRUTH: But he won’t know about it, will he? That’s why you’re here, as my expert on stealth.

Or by the Eastern Bloc for spying.\nRUTH: Seems to me, the petulant Frank Gorrister is nearly as unattractive as the tough Frank Gorrister.\nGORRISTER: Have you ever thought that maybe you just don’t like men?\nRUTH: I don’t like two particular types of men, the sensitive and the senseless.\nGORRISTER: That doesn’t leave a lot of wiggle room in between.\nRUTH: Then perhaps mankind should take a long, hard look at itself.\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 6\nRUTH: SCENE 3: INT.

So is there a reason for the diversion?\nDOCTOR: Does there have to be?\nMEL: No, it’s just that- Well, I’m dressed for a party. I’d like to know if I’ve got to change.\nDOCTOR: I often think that would be nice, too. Though in my case, the changes are usually more than just fashion-related.\nMEL: So are we going to a party or not?\nDOCTOR: Not a party, no. There’s just something I have to take care of.\nMEL: Should I be concerned?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so, Mel. It shouldn’t take more than an hour.

Don’t conjugate any verbs without me.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 11\nACE: SCENE 6: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — OUTSIDE THE TARDIS\nDOCTOR: What were you two talking about?\nACE: Girl stuff. Boys, shoes, nails, the usual. Which way?\nDOCTOR: Come along.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR: SCENE 7: INT. GORRISTER’S JET — FLIGHT DECK\nRUTH: Whoa!\nGORRISTER: Try to stay right way up, will you?\nRUTH: Do we absolutely have to fly this low over the treetops?\nGORRISTER: I thought it was a privilege to see an expert at work.\nRUTH: Do you want to know what I think?\nGORRISTER: You haven’t had an unexpressed thought since we took off.\nRUTH: I think you’re being deliberately reckless to try to scare me.\nGORRISTER: You really think I’m that petty?\nRUTH: Frankly-\nGORRISTER: Whoah-ho-ho! Bit too low that time! (LAUGHS AND HOOTS)\nRUTH: (SOTTO) Just keep telling yourself it’s for the good of humanity, Ruth.\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 13\nRUTH: SCENE 8: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — UNDERGROWTH\nDOCTOR: I get the impression you and Mel aren’t overly keen on my making this quick stop.\nACE: Only because your quick stops tend to involve some all-powerful Time Lord weapon you left on Earth by accident, like the Foot of Omega, or something.\nDOCTOR: I told you, you needn’t have come.\nACE: Ever heard of Pavlov, Professor?\nDOCTOR: He was never the same when his dog disappeared off after Schroedinger’s Cat. They named the Pavlova after him to try and cheer him up, but it was no good, he was inconsolable.\nACE: Yeah, I’m pretty sure none of that happened. But he discovered Pavlovian response, right?\nDOCTOR: It would have been awkward if someone else had discovered it; that would’ve meant changing the name.\nACE: Well, my Pavlovian response is to expect you to get into trouble every time you say you don’t expect any trouble.\nDOCTOR: But I don’t expect any trouble.\nACE: And there I go again.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 14\nACE: SCENE 9: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nMEL: What is the point of buying Spanish language tapes when the\nTARDIS: automatically puts them into English? I mean, how is it useful for me to know that “Yes, I would like a Sangria” translates as “Yes, I would like a Sangria”?\nMEL: Come on, one of these buttons must turn off the telepathic circuits, which one is it?\nMEL: No, I don’t want to see what’s on the monitor, that’s not even the right switch! How can you have two controls that do the same thing?\nMEL: What was that? A plane coming into land.. Why do I get the impression this is the sort of trouble Ace was talking about?\nMEL: I’m going to regret this. What am I saying? I already regret\nMEL: it!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 15\nMEL: SCENE 10: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — UNDERGROWTH\nACE: You saw that plane, right?\nDOCTOR: A P-One Thousand Bowhead stealth jet, powered by slush hydrogen. I thought they were still in the testing stages at this point.\nACE: Were you expecting it?\nDOCTOR: No.\nACE: So.. this is a bad thing?\nDOCTOR: Into each life some rain must fall. Why do you think I carry an umbrella?\nDOCTOR: Now... tell me what you think of this.\nACE: Looks like a load of ruins.\nDOCTOR: Archaeologists have speculated that it was once a temple, built before recorded time to honour a god no-one can even remember.\nACE: So what was the- (DISTRACTED BY BUTTERFLY) Clear off!\nDOCTOR: What is it, Ace?\nACE: A butterfly, right in my face!\nDOCTOR: Don’t swat it, you’ll start a tidal wave!\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: (D; ONSCREEN, FINISHING HIS THOUGHT) Or is it “prevent a hurricane”? I can never remember.\nSPENODUS: Intruders!

MOTUO JUNGLE — TEMPLE (CONT)\nACE: What about this little building here? A chapel, maybe?\nDOCTOR: Very close, but completely wrong. It’s actually a lift.\nACE: A 1ift? Made out of stone?\nDOCTOR: Just the natural results of the passing millennia. Let’s get it working again.\nDOCTOR: CHUNKS. ITS DOORS SLIDE OPEN.\nACE: It’s metal underneath!\nDOCTOR: Of a sort. Shall we be going?\nACE: What, inside there?\nDOCTOR: Les Only ia: litt.\nACE: A lift that hasn’t been used in so long the outside’s turned to stone.\nDOCTOR: There’s no shame in being afraid, you know.\nACE: I hope you know how to press the buttons in there as well as you press mine. (DISTRACTED BY THE BUTTERFLY) Get out of it!\nDOCTOR: Leave it alone, Ace. It’s about as harmless as- well, as another butterfly.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR: SCENE 13: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nSPENODUS: Replay that last segment!\nSPENODUS: FROM THE PREVIOUS SCREEN IS REPLAYED FOLLOWED BY NEW LINES.\nACE: (D; ONSCREEN) I hope you know how to press the buttons in there as well as you press mine, Professor. Get out of it!\nDOCTOR: (D) Leave it alone, Ace. It’s about as harmless as- well, as another butterfly. In you go.\nDOCTOR: (D) Next floor, menswear. Going down!\nSPENODUS: Mute!\nAVVOX: Who is “the Professor”?\nSPENODUS: And what was that device in his hand?\nAVVOX: It may have been constructed to provide protection against precipitation.\nSPENODUS: His other hand, Avvox!\nAVVOX: A- a sonic tool of some sort. Chordok would know better than I.\nSPENODUS: We have planned for too long for any unexpected intrusions!\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 19\nSPENODUS: SCENE 14: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — UNDERGROWTH\nMEL: (A LOUD HISS) Doctor? Ace? Are you anywhere about? (SOTTO) What am I doing? What are any of us doing? I’m just as likely to bump into whoever [was flying that-] (BREAKS OFF)\nMEL: Doctor, is that you?\nKARLA TWO: Please do not struggle. It is not my intention to exert the pressure sufficient to break your hyoid bone, but I may do so accidentally.\nMEL: (CHOKING) You’re- You’re a robot!\nKARLA TWO: The correct term is Security Android. I am designated Karla Two. What is your designation?\nMEL: I don’t have a designation, just a name. Melanie. Mel.\nKARLA TWO: Which is correct, Melanie or Mel?\nMEL: You can choose whichever you like if you just loosen your grip!\nKARLA TWO: Very well.\nMEL: (CAN BREATHE AGAIN) Whew!\nKARLA TWO: I select Mel for speed of pronunciation and to preserve power.\nMEL: Good idea. Keep your strength up. Look at you! You look magnificent, and so shiny! I can see my reflection in you.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 20\nKARLA TWO: You must come with me. My commander will wish to speak to you.\nMEL: I don’t seem to have much of a choice, do I?\nKARLA TWO: No.\nMEL: Easy, easy! So... Karla, was it?\nKARLA TWO: Karla Two.\nMEL: Karla Two. No point in asking if there are any more at home like you, then. Where were you made? Not here, or you’d be speaking Chinese. Oh wait, the telepathic circuits. Forget what I said.\nKARLA TWO: My memory capacity is at seventy-two per cent, I am incapable of forgetting. And I am speaking English.\nMEL: So who do you belong to? What’s the name of this commander?\nKARLA TWO: That information is restricted.\nMEL: Then should you really be taking me to see him? You could just forget you ever saw me.\nKARLA TWO: My memory capacity-\nMEL: I know, seventy-two per cent.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 21\nMEL: SCENE 15: INT. SILURIAN LIFT\nDOCTOR: Anyway, I dispersed the Key to Time throughout the Universe, so the Black Guardian couldn’t get his hands on it again. What do you think of that, Ace?\nACE: What do I think of what? You haven’t said anything for twenty\nACE: minutes, then you pipe up with “Anyway, I dispersed the Key to Time throughout the Universe”. What am I supposed to think of\nACE: that?\nDOCTOR: Really? I must’ve just thought the other parts. Pity you’re not telepathic, Ace, you would’ve found it very vivid, especially the sword fights.\nACE: I bet. You know, Professor, these are the times you just don’t get back.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 22\nACE: SCENE 16: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — OUTSIDE THE JET\nRUTH: This is a waste of time, Gorrister.\nGORRISTER: That’s what I said.\nRUTH: Sending Karla Two off, I mean. She only detected a- a field mouse, or whatever they have in this part of the world.\nGORRISTER: We have a saying in my profession: better safe than mown down by a firing squad.\nRUTH: Sane people have a similar saying. Look, Karla Three can’t manage the drill on her own, can she?\nKARLA THREE: Its weight exceeds my power specifications.\nRUTH: You see? Call her back.\nGORRISTER: No need, that’s her heading back now.\nMEL: Ouch!\nGORRISTER: With company.\nMEL: Er, hello.\nRUTH: Who are you?\nKARLA TWO: Her name is Mel.\nGORRISTER: Who are you working for?\nGORRISTER: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 23\nMEL: I’m not working for anyone, I’m sort of between employers. Quite a long way between, really. Can you tell your android let me go, please? I’m not armed, and she is. That thing on arm is a gun, isn’t it?\nRUTH: Let her go, Karla. (BEAT) Why didn’t that work?\nGORRISTER: Karla Two, release her.\nRUTH: Have to remember the number, right. Did Chairman Falco send you, Mel?\nMEL: Falco? No.\nGORRISTER: She could be working for Director Shen. She said she was a freelancer.\nMEL: I didn’t actually say that.\nGORRISTER: Well, are you a freelancer, or aren’t you?\nMEL: I work mainly with computers.\nGORRISTER: Cyber-espionage. Like it.\nMEL: You do? Good. Does that mean I can go?\nGORRISTER: Oh, hell no. No, it’d be a lot safer if we just killed you.\nGORRISTER: to her\nGORRISTER: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 24\nGORRISTER: SCENE 17: INT. SILURIAN LIFT\nACE: So anyway, when the streetlamps came back on, I was hopping onto the bus, and he was left holding the chicken.\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nACE: Now you know what it feels like to come in on the end of a story.\nDOCTOR: Oh, a chicken! I was picturing a mongoose for some reason. Yes, a chicken makes much more sense.\nACE: You can’t read my mind.\nDOCTOR: You’d like to think that, wouldn’t you?\nACE: So what am I thinking now?\nDOCTOR: Wash your mind out with soap, young lady!\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — UNDERGROWTH\nDOCTOR: BLEEPING FROM RUTH’S WRISTPAD.\nGORRISTER: We should’ve killed her.\nRUTH: “We” are not killing anyone. Wristpad says twenty degrees to the left, everyone.\nGORRISTER: Every second she’s alive is a threat to this mission. You want my assistance, Ruth, but you won’t take my advice.\nRUTH: No, I won’t. And don’t call me Ruth. We’re not friends, Gorrister.\nMEL: Is it all right if I call you Ruth? Because I’d just like to say I am delighted that you’re the one giving the orders.\nGORRISTER: Yeah, I’m just here to do the heavy lifting.\nMEL: Seems like the Karlas are the ones doing the lifting. What is that thing they’re carrying? It looks like an enormous drill.\nRUTH: There’s a good reason for that.\nRUTH: This is it! This is the place!\nMEL: The place for what?\nRUTH: The place where I show you just what we’re doing and why we’re\nRUTH: doing, 1.\nMEL: These look like the ruins of a temple!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 26\nRUTH: So it would seem.\nGORRISTER: I thought the whole point of this exercise was so no-one knew we were doing it.\nRUTH: Ideally, but she’s here now. I’m going to present my results to the leaders of both blocs simultaneously. What does it matter if she’s working for Falco or Shen?\nMEL: What if I’m working for neither?\nRUTH: She can report back to her masters that what we do here, we do for the good of mankind. Karlas Two and Three, set the drill down right there.\nMEL: So you’re planning to bore down through the Earth?\nRUTH: Should probably take a few hours. I hope you brought a book to pass the time, Mel.\nMEL: Why don’t you just use the lift?\nGORRISTER: What lift?\nMEL: Right behind you. It certainly looks like a lift.\nGORRISTER: My God!\nRUTH: This is impossible.\nGORRISTER: (TO MEL) You don’t look surprised.\nMEL: You travel with the Doctor for long enough, you get used to the\nMEL: impossible.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 27\nRUTH: Doctor Wh- (SNEEZES)\nGORRISTER: Allergies, Professor Drexler?\nRUTH: No, a butterfly just landed on my nose!\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 28\nRUTH: SCENE 19: INT. SILURIAN CITY\nACE: The buildings... they’re like bubbles, blown out of the rock. They go on forever.\nDOCTOR: Welcome to the world beneath the world, Ace.\nACE: How long has this place been here?\nDOCTOR: Long before the first of your ancestors crawled out of sea. Contrary to my advice, incidentally.\nACE: Aliens were living under our feet all this time?\nDOCTOR: Some people called this place Shambhala. To the Nazis, it was New Schwabia. Edgar Rice Burroughs knew it as Pellucidar.\nACE: What do you call it?\nACE: Professor, is the lift going back up automatically, or did someone call it?\nDOCTOR: The latter, I think.\nACE: Since you weren’t expecting anyone to fly in, I’m going to go ahead and guess that this isn’t part of your brilliant plan, either.\nDOCTOR: I could tell you that it is, but you wouldn’t believe me.\nACE: Maybe you can read my mind.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 29\nACE: SCENE 20: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nACE: FROM THE PREVIOUS SCREEN IS REPLAYED.\nRUTH: This is impossible.\nGORRISTER: (TO MEL) You don’t look surprised.\nMEL: You travel with the Doctor for long enough, you get used to the impossible.\nSPENODUS: The Doctor!\nRUTH: Doctor Wh- (SNEEZES)\nGORRISTER: Allergies, Prof-\nAVVOX: Pause playback!\nAVVOX: The Professor and the Doctor. The same being?\nSPENODUS: He has altered his appearance more than once, Avvox. We are too close to completion to permit his interference. Measures must be taken!\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 30\nSPENODUS: SCENE 21: INT. SILURIAN CITY\nACE: In the time we’ve been waiting we could’ve explored this whole place and been back.\nDOCTOR: Patience is a virtue, Ace, as well as an opera. Don’t you want to find out who else is interested in the city?\nACE: The only person I want to see walk out of that lift is-\nACE: Mel!\nMEL: Hello, you two.\nDOCTOR: Ola, Mel.\nMEL: That’s not fair, why doesn’t it translate when you say it?\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS, my rules.\nGORRISTER: You weren’t joking about this place, were you, Ruth?\nMEL: This is Gorrister, that’s Professor Drexler, and these are two robots called Karla.\nDOCTOR: A pleasure to meet you all, especially the Karlas. Wonderful design, very Fritz Lang.\nRUTH: Seems as though you know as much about this place as I do, Doctor.\nACE: More, I’ll bet.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: This way, if memory serves.\nMEL: This way for what?\nDOCTOR: The parliament of the Silurians.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22: INT. DEEPER INTO SILURIAN CITY\nGORRISTER: So we're just trusting everyone now?\nMEL: It’s us who should have trust issues; you’re the one with the guns. I mean, the robots with guns on their arms.\nACE: Which is actually dead cool, by the way.\nACE: (SIMULTANEOUSLY ) KARLA TWO: KARLA THREE: Thank-you. Thank-you.\nRUTH: Watch your step, the Silurians didn’t believe in railings, and it’s a long way down.\nMEL: What are the Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Have I not mentioned them before?\nMEL: I'd have remembered.\nDOCTOR: Many millions of years ago, this was their capital city. That rather imposing structure was their parliament building.\nACE: Right (SPITS ON HER HANDS), who wants to help me get those doors open?\nDOCTOR: Not so fast, Ace. They might be electrified.\nMEL: Not very sociable.\nGORRISTER: Karla Two, Karla Three, get those doors open.\nKARLA TWO: Synchronise, Karla Three.\nKARLA THREE: Synchronised, Karla Two.\nKARLA THREE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 33\nGORRISTER: Nice work. C’mon, let’s go inside.\nGORRISTER: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 34\nGORRISTER: SCENE 23: INT. PARLIAMENT HALL (CONT)\nKARLA TWO: No electrical discharge detected.\nDOCTOR: Odd. I would’ve expected some type of security measure.\nMEL: Why? The people who built this can’t still be alive... Can they?\nRUTH: It’s beautiful! So smooth and... big.\nACE: Pretty tall were they, these Silurians?\nDOCTOR: What makes you think that, Ace?\nACE: Why else would they have made the ceilings so high?\nDOCTOR: Oh, that would have been to accommodate their pets.\nDOCTOR: DINOSAUR.\nGORRISTER: What kind of pets?\nDOCTOR: Dinosaurs.\nRUTH: Oh my God!\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 35"

About himself, I mean. You haven’t answered my question... like that should be a surprise.\nDOCTOR: A Silurian I bumped into on the Galapagos Islands dabbled in genetic experimentation. The Karlas just killed an example of his craft.\nACE: A dinosaur watchdog? I hope someone remembered to sort out food and a litter tray.\nDOCTOR: It was awakened quite recently.\nACE: She. Awakened by who — these Silurians?\nDOCTOR: More likely by an alarm system activated when the Karlas opened the doors. The Silurians themselves have been hibernating down here for several million years.\nACE: OK, Professor, it’s time for explanations. Who are these Silurians, where did they come from?\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR: They came from right here, Ace.

Maybe that’s all I am to him, a big heart.\nKARLA TWO: I do not detect signs of enlargement.\nMEL: Maybe that’s why he needs me now, because he’s forgotten how to feel. And if that’s what I’m here for, what does that say about what he’s done to Ace?\nKARLA TWO: I do not have the data required to answer that question.\nKARLA TWO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 42\nKARLA TWO: SCENE 27: INT.

In reality, it was just the moon coming into orbit.\nACE: I bet that caused a few red faces. They’ve got faces, right?\nDOCTOR: At this point in time, they haven’t been revived in particularly large numbers. Last year, a small number laid siege to an underwater defence base.\nACE: Not fans of humanity, then.\nDOCTOR: Try and see things from their point of view. They forgot to set their alarm clocks and wake up to find their home overrun by squatters.\nACE: You snooze, you lose. Literally.\nDOCTOR: To them, humanity is as much of an alien invader as the Daleks and the Cybermen are to humanity.\nACE: That’s not even close to being the same thing.\nDOCTOR: It is in the eyes of the Silurians. All three of them.\nACE: Three eyes or three Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and yes. The central chamber contains the capsules of the ruling triad: Spenodus, Avvox and Chordok.\nACE: So you’re going to wake them up and say, sorry, the Earth’s under new management?\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: Nothing of the sort, Ace.

Just follow me.\nRUTH: I’m wondering if I should trust you, Doctor.\nACE: You’re not the only one.\nRUTH: Is there any chance you’1l tell me how you came by this knowledge?\nDOCTOR: From the Silurians themselves, a very long time ago. En masse, they’re extremely civilized. And you?\nKARLA THREE: Combined sociological studies suggest that Professor Drexler is Eighty-two percent civilized.\nACE: I think he meant how did she get those plans, Karla Two.\nKARLA THREE: Karla Three.\nACE: Sorry, you look... similar.\nKARLA THREE: Identical, save for a quarter-inch scratch on my casing incurred during the unpackaging process.\nRUTH: To answer your question, Doctor, I was sent the plans by a member of the government, someone who’d prefer to remain anonymous.\nDOCTOR: And how did he or she get them?\nRUTH: I think I’m done explaining.\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR: Then permit me. They were recovered after the incident at Sea Base Four.\nRUTH: How do you know that?\nDOCTOR: I was there.\nRUTH: Impossible.\nACE: You hear that word a lot when you hang around with the Professor. You said the Silurians attacked the base.\nDOCTOR: A small unit, yes. They attempted to initiate a world war.\nACE: I’m not loving their reputation.\nDOCTOR: I thought I’d fried the circuits on the Sea Devil ship.\nACE: What’s a Sea Devil when it’s at home?\nDOCTOR: It is home. Pay attention, Ace.\nRUTH: My contact used a graverobber program to recover the software. Some, anyway, most of it’s still pretty scrambled.\nDOCTOR: My friend Mel might be able to help you with that. She’s very capable.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: SCENE 31: INT. PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS\nKARLA TWO: Please do not attempt to escape, Mel.\nMEL: You’re not going to tell me that resistance is futile, are you?\nKARLA TWO: No. But it is.\nKARLA TWO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 50\nKARLA TWO: SCENE 32: INT. PARLIAMENT WALKWAY\nACE: So why do you want to wake up the Silurians, Ruth? Wait, don’t tell me: you want their advanced weapons.\nDOCTOR: Technically, their weapons are prehistoric, but more effective than slings and spears.\nRUTH: Who said I wanted to wake them?\nACE: Then what are you doing here?\nRUTH: I want their research on hibernation. It’s far ahead of anything we’ve achieved. The reconstructed data gave me the location of the creatures’ capital — beneath Eastern Bloc territory, wouldn’t you know it — and a map of the city. There’s a data hub in the central chamber, and I plan to access ats\nDOCTOR: That’s really all you’re after?\nRUTH: It’s the key to everything, Doctor. The world’s been on the brink my entire life, the only thing we can do is leave it all behind. Our destiny lies out there, in deep space. With the hibernation technology, we can have it!\nDOCTOR: Just your side of the conflict?\nRUTH: Not at all. Once I have the data on my wristpad, I’m going to provide it to Chairman Falco and Director Shen simultaneously. There’ll be no edge — both sides can co-operate to secure humanity’s future.\nACE: Sounds too good to be true.\nDOCTOR: Possibly, Ace, but I have a good deal of time for optimists. I wish you all the best with your endeavour, Ruth.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 51\nRUTH: And what about yours?\nACE: Good question.\nDOCTOR: Nothing you need trouble yourself over. (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Oh, look! The central chamber.\nRUTH: That giant igloo thing, yes. No doors for you to push open, Karla Three.\nKARLA THREE: I observe.\nDOCTOR: The ruling triad were accessible to the rest of their people at all times.\nACE: Blimey, my mum had to write to her M.P. about the noise from next door, and she never even got a reply.\nRUTH: Fortunately, it doesn’t seem tall enough to house a Tyrannosaur.\nACE: It wasn’t a Tyrannosaur.\nRUTH: I’ll take your word for it.

(REACTS TO TWINGE OF PAIN) Make that twenty- two.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 55\nRUTH: I thought that was really it.\nACE: I reckon I would’ve preferred a dinosaur. What was that?\nDOCTOR: Mantric energy.\nRUTH: Never heard of it.\nDOCTOR: Silurians can generate it with their third eye. A broad stream like that disrupts neural pathways.\nKARLA THREE: And my amblicyclic network.\nDOCTOR: Yes, my apologies for that, Karla Three.\nKARLA THREE: Unnecessary.\nRUTH: So the Silurians were their own power source?\nDOCTOR: In a limited fashion. They could store it in vehicles and tools.\nACE: And weapons.\nDOCTOR: But it couldn’t power anything on the scale of this city.\nRUTH: Worthy of further research, I’d say.\nDOCTOR: I advise against it, Ruth. A concentrated blast would have unravelled all four of us.\nACE: Remind me again about how civilized they’re supposed to be.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: They were born with that ability, Ace. They didn’t have to invent it, like the gun.\nACE: They didn’t have to set up a booby trap with it, either.\nRUTH: I am starting to feel a little unwanted.\nACE: What are you doing with all those bits, Professor?\nDOCTOR: Only an amateur burglar doesn’t tidy up after themselves. Besides, I have a notion I can use these components to build a particle suppressor.\nRUTH: Something that’1ll protect us from another mantric energy attack?\nDOCTOR: Hopefully.\nRUTH: (DEPARTING) I don’t plan to be around long enough for that to happen. The data hub should be through here. Come on, Karla Three.\nDOCTOR: You’d best keep an eye on her, Ace.\nACE: Right.\nACE: (DEPARTING) What are you going to be doing?\nDOCTOR: Just picking up the pieces.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR: SCENE 36: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER — ANTEROOM\nRUTH: That’s what we want. Very nice.\nACE: Aren’t you worried about having the right connectors?\nRUTH: Ace! You frightened the- hell out of me.\nACE: Don’t panic, I’m not a dinosaur. I said, aren’t you worried-\nRUTH: Not at all. I was hoping the Silurians would have some wi-fi interface equivalent, and they do. It’s not completely compatible, but I’ve got something.\nACE: Not remorse. Gorrister’s probably dead now, and you don’t seem in the least bit bothered.\nRUTH: This is what he would have wanted.\nACE: To be bitten nearly in two by a dinosaur? Well, you knew him better than I did.\nRUTH: Dying in the middle of the action, I mean, not winding up on life-support somewhere. Besides, he made the mistake of owing me a favour.\nACE: Big favour.\nRUTH: It was. He was a government operative. Four years ago, he came to me, asking for advice on how to sabotage Eastern Bloc space shots. I didn’t want to believe anyone would die as a result. I was spectacularly naive. He said at the time he’d do anything for me in return.\nACE: You needed someone to get you into the Silurian capital.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 58\nRUTH: I couldn’t very well take my proposal directly to Falco, he’d never have authorized it. Better to present him with the results once the job’s done.\nACE: I doubt Gorrister knew what he was getting into when he agreed to help you. I know that feeling.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 59\nACE: SCENE 37: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: Chordok, Spenodus and Avvox.. Where have you got to?

Can anybody hear me?\nDOCTOR: Mel?\nSLIDES: SHUT. HE TAKES A FEW QUICK FOOTSTEPS TO DOOR.\nSLIDES: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 60\nSLIDES: SCENE 38: INT. PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS (CONT)\nDOCTOR: (FROM WAY OFF) Mel? (SEES HER IN DISTANCE) There you are! Why are you crouching down like that?\nMEL: Doctor, thank heavens! Karla Two’s after me! She’s trying to kill me!\nDOCTOR: (WAY OFF) Why?\nMEL: Does that matter? I’m pinned down here, can you help me?\nDOCTOR: (WAY OFF) Yes, I’m coming!\nMEL: No! You’ll be a target, too! Just- do something brilliant!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 61\nMEL: SCENE 39: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER (CONT)\nACE: Doctor? What’s going on? I thought I heard Mel.\nDOCTOR: You did. Karla Two’s out to kill her.\nACE: Why?\nDOCTOR: Does that matter, Ace?\nRUTH: This must be Gorrister’s doing. Even dead, he’s an\nRUTH: inconvenience.\nMEL: (WAY OFF) Are you still there?\nDOCTOR: Still here, Mel! Just brainstorming!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 40: INT. PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS (CONT)\nMEL: (RESPONDING TO THE DOCTOR) Well, storm faster! I’m running out of cover!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 62\nMEL: SCENE 41: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER (CONT)\nACE: Karla Three, can you get out there and\nKARLA THREE: shoot down Karla Two?\nKARLA THREE: I am unable to harm the mission controller, whatever the\nKARLA THREE: circumstances.\nDOCTOR: So much for the laws of robotics. Ace,\nDOCTOR: carrying any Nitro-Nine?\nACE: Not these days.\nRUTH: And I’m not armed. So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you’re\nDOCTOR: Karla Three, step this way. The Doctor will see you now.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42: INT. PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS\nKARLA TWO: Remain still, please. You are causing a delay in the completion of my mission.\nMEL: Why not just forget all about me, and get on with it them? You don’t have to do this, you know.\nKARLA TWO: My programming states that it is the first thing I must-\nKARLA: THREE APPROACH.\nACE: Shoot her again!\nKARLA TWO: Please do not shoot me. It hampers my ability to function at optimal efficiency.\nMEL: Oh, thank goodness!\nACE: Thank Ruth.\nRUTH: And the Doctor. He used that sonic- thing to get the gun off Karla Three’s wrist.\nDOCTOR: In fairness, the mantric energy blast loosened it up quite a bit. How are you feeling, Mel?\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 64\nMEL: Glad I took up jogging round the TARDIS corridors. Karla Three’s not going to come after me now, is she?\nDOCTOR: Not after I did a little tinkering with her circuits. I hope it didn’t tickle, Karla Three.\nKARLA THREE: I am unfamiliar with the sensation. Or any sensation.\nMEL: Gorrsiter’s dead, by the way.\nRUTH: No surprise there.\nMEL: Not even a little regret?\nACE: We’ve already been through all that, Mel. It’s a long story.\nDOCTOR: I should like very much to hear it. I enjoy stories.\nRUTH: Another time, maybe. Here, can you get this gun thing back on Karla Three?\nDOCTOR: It may have been easier to remove it than to replace it. Look after this, would you, Mel?\nACE: Hey, I want a gun!\nDOCTOR: Which is precisely why I’m not giving it to you. Mel, only use it if you need to. But try not to need to.\nMEL: I'd rather not.\nACE: Fine, give it here.\nMEL: Tell you what, I’1ll just put it somewhere hard-to-reach.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 65\nRUTH: Right, I’ve got everything I can, now let’s get the hell out of here.\nDOCTOR: Not quite yet, I’m afraid. There’s something in the central chamber I want you to see.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: SCENE 43: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER\nMEL: Well, this place is nice. But anywhere no-one’s trying to kill me is nice.\nACE: So what is it we’re supposed to be looking at?\nDOCTOR: These.\nMEL: What are they?\nRUTH: Hibernation cells.\nACE: For the ruling Silurian triad, right?\nDOCTOR: Correct, Ace.\nMEL: I feel like I’ve missed a lot while I’ve been running for my life. I’m still not clear on who these Silurians are.\nDOCTOR: Plenty of time to catch up later, Mel.\nRUTH: You haven’t told me what you want with them, Doctor.\nACE: Good question. Tell us, Professor.\nDOCTOR: There’s time for that later, too. Right now, we have a small problem.\nRUTH: The cells are empty!\nDOCTOR: Concerning, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 67\nACE: So they’re wandering about down here, too.\nMEL: Are they the ones who let that tyrannosaur loose?\nRUTH: It wasn’t a tyrannosaur.\nMEL: Whatever it was, then.\nDOCTOR: Not unless it was done remotely. I checked for Silurian heat Signatures and came up negative.\nACE: So unless they went looking for bunk-mates, they’re gone.\nDOCTOR: Long gone. Records indicate that their cells were last opened four years ago.\nRUTH: So what have they been doing for the last four years?\nDOCTOR: I honestly wish I knew, Ruth.\nRUTH: OK, change of plan. I have to see Chairman Falco. He needs to know that there are three Silurians at large on the planet!\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 68\nRUTH: SCENE 44: INT. PARLIAMENT WALKWAY\nLAG: BEHIND.\nMEL: Where exactly is the base of government these days?\nRUTH: Canberra, obviously.\nMEL: Obviously. I’ve never been to Canberra.\nRUTH: Then I hate to have to disappoint you now, but that’s not where we’re going. Falco’s about to leave there for an island off the coast of Washington State. A presidential retreat, back when there were still presidents.\nMEL: Well, I’ve never been there either.\nRUTH: He’s there to hold talks with Director Shen of the Eastern Bloc. It’s mostly for show, you know, shake hands for the camera, Signatures on some meaningless piece of paper... but you can imagine how tense everyone is after the Sea Base thing.\nMEL: Not really. I would’ve asked Karla Two to bring me up to speed, but she was a bit busy trying to kill me.\nRUTH: I wanted to hand the Silurian hibernation data over to both leaders on the island, once I’d got it decrypted.\nMEL: Maybe I could do that for you.\nRUTH: Fine. I never thought I’d say this, but there are bigger issues now, though what Falco will do with the information, I can’t imagine. Please don’t tell me you voted for him.\nMEL: I can honestly say I didn’t. So is someone finally going to tell me what the Silurians are?\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 69\nRUTH: Well, I suspect the term is a misnomer. They should properly be called Eocenes, and they roamed this world some fifty million years ago.\nMEL: Wait, so they’re actually from the Earth? They pre-date mankind? Surely there’d be some sort of fossil record.\nRUTH: Not necessarily. There was an incident in Alaska late last century. Most of the evidence is anecdotal, but if a creature is sufficiently intelligent, it doesn’t leave behind any obvious traces.\nMEL: Ruth, this is incredible! I can’t believe the Doctor’s never mentioned it before.\nCROSS TO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 70\nCROSS TO: SCENE 45: INT. PARLIAMENT WALKWAY — A FEW FEET AWAY (CONT)\nCROSS TO: THE NEAR-DISTANCE.\nACE: When are you going to tell them?\nDOCTOR: Tell them what?\nACE: That you’re selling them out, giving the planet back to the Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Is that what I’m doing?\nACE: That’s what you said before!\nDOCTOR: Ace... homo reptilia are no more evil than homo sapiens. Alas, I’ve let them down on several occasions.\nACE: So this is your way of making it up to them? How do you think Mel and Ruth are going to react to that?\nDOCTOR: Why don’t you tell them?\nACE: When I know for certain what you’re up to. Until then, I’m playing it close to my chest.\nDOCTOR: You’re a woman after my own hearts, Ace. Ah! The lift...\nDOCTOR: Everybody in, please! — Ruth, you won’t mind if we accompany you?\nRUTH: You ever flown in a Bowhead jet?\nDOCTOR: Oh, many times. But not yet.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 71\nMEL: We could always take the-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Take the lift to the surface, that’s exactly what we’re going to do, Mel.\nACE: Anyone else hear that?\nMEL: I thought you said the Silurians were gone!\nMEL: (SIMULTANEOUSLY ) APEMAN ONE: APEMAN TWO:\nDOCTOR: They’re not Silurians.\nACE: Cavemen! Brilliant!\nRUTH: They don’t seem at all happy. More watchdogs, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Recently revived, I think!

You’re not telling me you burst\nRUTH: tears when your toaster breaks.\nACE: The Professor might. He can’t stand burnt toast.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Would you mind moving to one side, please, Mel?\nMEL: What for?\nDOCTOR: I just want to.. (STRAINS AS HE PULLS CONTROL PANEL) get to control panel.\nACE: There’s probably a fine for that.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure there’s a greater penalty to pay if someone takes control of this lift and sends us back down again.\nRUTH: into\nRUTH: that\nRUTH: I can’t see those creatures knowing how to even press a button.\nMEL: I think we’re in bigger trouble with whoever’s controlling them.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: Ah, you saw the micro-filaments running across their scalps, too? Well spotted, Mel.\nACE: The Silurians know we’ve been here, then.\nDOCTOR: I did think there was something strange about that butterfly...\nRUTH: I saw a butterfly!\nACE: Small world.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but surprisingly roomy on the inside.\nMEL: Like the TARDIS.\nRUTH: Like the what?\nDOCTOR: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) We’re picking up speed. Should reach ground level in less than half the time.\nACE: Just so long as we don’t keep going. I’ve read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nMEL: Willy Wonka, that’s it! Finally, I’ve realised who you remind me of, Doctor!\nRUTH: Wait, how did the Silurians get their hands on examples of prehistoric man?\nDOCTOR: It’s not so much a question of acquisition as it is of design. I take it you can remember the way back to your jet, yes?\nRUTH: I don’t have to, I’ve got a tracker on my- What did you mean, “design”?\nACE: There’s no point in asking him to explain himself; he’s not in the mood for doing that.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page\nACE: SCENE 48: EXT.

I want her to put our safety above that of any others of her number we might run into.\nRUTH: Chairman Falco has platinum Karlas. Top of the line models.\nDOCTOR: There. Now, Karla One, how does that feel?\nKARLA ONE: I am incapable of feeling, and therefore equally incapable of responding.\nACE: Except that you just have. If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a pernickety robot.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 80\nMEL: We’re in trouble!\nRUTH: Don’t tell me we didn’t get the specs!\nMEL: Yes- no- I don’t know! Never mind about that, I know what the Silurians are up to!\nACE: Oh, they’re too civilized to be up to something, isn’t that right, Professor?\nMEL: Ace, what is the matter with you?

It’s just you and me at the moment, right?\nJODELET: There is no-one else here, Monsieur Chairman. It was one of Director Shen’s demands, you might recall.\nFALCO: Yeah, Director Shen. Don’t tell anyone this, Jodelet, but that woman gives me the creeps. Just something about her, she comes across SO.. SO...\nJODELET: Cold-blooded?\nFALCO: That’s it. That’s it.\nJODELET: Nevertheless, she is due to touch down in... (CHECKS TIME) .. a little over two and a half hours. With your permission, Monsieur Chairman, I shall check the cameras are set up for the Signing ceremony.\nFALCO: Yeah, fine, fine. Oh, and Jodelet?\nJODELET: It’s “Mister” Chairman, “Mister”.\nJODELET: Indeed, Mr Chairman.\nFALCO: Don’t forget.\nFALCO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 82\nFALCO: SCENE 55: INT. GORRISTER’S JET — FLIGHT DECK\nRUTH: I can’t make out who it is lying on the operating table, they’re all covered up.\nMEL: He says it’s the leader of the human sect.\nRUTH: Yes, but which sect? The Eastern Bloc or the Western Bloc?\nMEL: Well, I don’t know. The program crashed before I got that far.\nACE: Well, if we’re going to accuse one of them of being a Silurian zombie, we should probably know which one it is.\nRUTH: Is there no way of reconstructing the rest of the report?\nMEL: There might be. I just thought you ought to know before we reached the island. How much further is it?\nRUTH: We’re almost on top of it. I wasn’t looking forward to explaining my presence in restricted airspace before, I relish it even less now.\nMEL: I’1l1 let you know when I’ve got something more.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 83\nMEL: SCENE 56: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nSPENODUS: Still, the Doctor persists in hampering our plans!\nAVVOX: He cannot be allowed to interact with the candidate. We must delay him.\nSPENODUS: Delay him, Avvox? We must destroy him!\nREPETITIVE: ALARM.\nREPETITIVE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 84\nREPETITIVE: SCENE 57: INT.

I’m quiet.\nACE: Wondering whether the Silurians need your help after all?\nRUTH: What help? Doctor, what’s she talking about?\nRUTH: What the hell is that?\nDOCTOR: It’s a proximity alert.\nACE: Someone’s launched a missile at us!\nRUTH: I’ll try and contact someone on the island, tell them to abort.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it’1ll do much good now, Ruth. That’s a Silurian weapon!\nRUTH: Brace for impact!\nRUTH: SCENE 58: EXT.

It sounded like an explosion.\nFALCO: (D) I thought so, too.

SILURIAN SHIP — LAB\nMEL: I don’t know how... but I’m alive.\nCHORDOK: The section of the craft in which you were travelling struck the water.\nMEL: (GASPS) You’re a Silurian!\nCHORDOK: And you are a mammal.\nMEL: I- Yes, I suppose I am, but you can call me Mel. What do I call you?\nCHORDOK: Not ‘Silurian’. I am a person. My name is Chordok.\nMEL: What am I doing here, Chordok? And where is here? It looks like the city, but- but I can’t be back there! How long was I unconscious?\nCHORDOK: Less than the time-unit known as one hour. Your body was retrieved, and you were brought to my laboratory.\nMEL: Well, thank-you for saving me from drowning, that was nice. The explosion, what was that?\nCHORDOK: One of our projectiles.\nMEL: That was less nice. I suppose that means I’m a prisoner.\nCHORDOK: As a scientist, I think of you as a subject.\nCHORDOK: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 87\nMEL: I think I’ve seen you in a video quite recently. I was with some other mammals, friends of mine. Are they here?\nCHORDOK: The Doctor is not a mammal. Not one common to this planet.\nMEL: You know him, then? Can I speak to him, is he alright?\nCHORDOK: What are the Doctor’s intentions?\nMEL: I don’t know. Was he hurt? I want to see him!\nCHORDOK: What are his plans?\nCHORDOK: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 88\nCHORDOK: SCENE 61: EXT. FALCO’S RETREAT — SHORELINE\nACE: I think he’s coming to, Ruth. Professor?\nDOCTOR: (DROWSILY) Oh, Ace, I was having the most terrible dream. A man in ringlets was reaching out to me, saying “Come in, Number Seven, your time is up”.\nRUTH: Welcome back, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Ruth, this is very cosy.\nRUTH: It’s not cosy, we’re stuck together!\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) I don’t seem to be able to move.\nRUTH: None of us can move until the foam dissolves.\nACE: Foam?\nRUTH: Yes, the foam. Where are you two from?\nACE: Just tell him what this stuff is!\nRUTH: It’s a safety measure. You were covered in it at the moment of impact. It hardens instantly, prevents any broken bones.\nACE: All my bones feel like they’re broken.\nRUTH: They’re probably just bruised. The protective crust starts to dissolve after an hour or so.\nDOCTOR: (SUDDEN REALIZATION) Mel! Where’s Mel?\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott\nACE: She’s not here. I think the jet split in two.\nDOCTOR: We'll find her, Ace. We just have to get up...\nDOCTOR: I think this foam’s starting to dissolve.\nACE: (FINAL) Page 89\nACE: She must be-\nACE: Brilliant! Try struggling a bit, that might loosen it more.\nDOCTOR: It might be a little late for that, Ace. Look.\nRUTH: Platinum Karlas!\nKARLA: FORTY-SEVEN: You are intruders on this island.\nDOCTOR: We didn’t so much “intrude” as “crash”.\nKARLA: THIRTY-ONE:\nKARLA: We have instructions on how to deal with intruders.\nKARLA: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 90\nKARLA: SCENE 62: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nSPENODUS: Chordok! What progress has been made?\nCHORDOK: (D; OVER RADIO) The human is reluctant to co-operate.\nMEL: (D; OVER RADIO) The human has a name!\nSPENODUS: This delay is unacceptable! We are close to achieving our aim! We must know how much of a threat this Doctor poses. You should use the surgical instruments!\nCHORDOK: (D) Surely a dissection would cause further delay, Spenodus.\nSPENODUS: I did not say perform surgery! I simply said you should use the instruments!\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 91\nSPENODUS: SCENE 63: EXT. FALCO’S RETREAT — WOODS\nRUTH: You didn’t have to shoot the foam off us, you know. You could always just have cracked it open.\nKARLA: FORTY-SEVEN: That would have been less efficient.\nACE: And less terrifying.\nKARLA: FORTY-SEVEN: As the result of a faulty battery, Karla Thirty-One is already operating at eighty-nine percent efficiency.\nKARLA: THIRTY-ONE: Eighty-eight.\nKARLA: FORTY-SEVEN: Eighty-eight percent efficiency. Unnecessary conversation is also a drain.\nDOCTOR: How true, how true.\nRUTH: Well, that’s fine. It’s the Chairman we want to talk to. I just pray it’1ll do some good.\nACE: You don’t have a lot of faith in this bloke, then.\nRUTH: I voted for Senator Albert. Everybody else voted for Falco out of fear and name-recognition.\nDOCTOR: It’s not a name I recognise.\nRUTH: Where have you been, on the moon?\nDOCTOR: Amongst other places. Indulge us.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 92\nRUTH: Falco was the Western Bloc’s premier arms manufacturer. He was voted in on a platform of keeping us safe, whatever the cost. I don’t think he ever expected that the cost might be negotiation. It’s probably more painful to him than actually going to war.\nACE: Then why doesn’t he just declare war, if he’s the one in charge?\nDOCTOR: Because the one in charge isn’t necessarily the one who wields the power. Not always a bad thing.\nACE: I notice nobody’s asking what happens if Falco turns out to be the body under the sheet.\nRUTH: The Silurian capital’s under Eastern Bloc territory, Ace. It’s more likely to be Director Shen. Maybe.\nACE: Just so long as he helps us look for Mel, I could care less-\nACE: BEATING THE OTHER TWO KARLAS.\nACE: Karla One!\nKARLA ONE: I am here to rescue you.\nRUTH: I thought she’d been destroyed in the crash!\nKARLA: FORTY-SEVEN: Please do not attack us, inferior Karla.\nKARLA: THIRTY-ONE: There is no apparent benefit to be derived from compromising my\nDOCTOR: Karla One, please stop! You’re destroying them! Stop!\nDOCTOR: GROUND.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: Oh, well... that’s them all over.\nRUTH: Brilliant. Before she tore them to pieces we were just intruders. Now we’re insurrectionists. Karla One, where’ve you been all this time?\nKARLA ONE: On the seabed.\nACE: You sank!\nKARLA ONE: Affirmative. I was forced to walk here in order to rescue you.\nACE: So now what do we do?\nDOCTOR: Now we do the only thing we can, Ace. Karla One... take us to their leader.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR: SCENE 64: EXT. FALCO’S RETREAT — LANDING PAD\nJODELET: Mr Chairman! I hoped I’d find you\nFALCO: Jodelet, how’s my hair looking? I the updraft when Shen lands.\nJODELET: No-one would ever know, sir.\nFALCO: (DEADLY SERIOUS) Know what?\nJODELET: Er, nothing. Mr Chairman, there’s\nFALCO: at the pad.\nFALCO: don’t want it messed about by\nFALCO: been a development.\nFALCO: Don’t say she’s delayed, doesn’t she realise how much this matters to- (STOPS HIMSELF) to the whole world?\nJODELET: Actually, sir, Director Shen’s craft is due to arrive at landing pad the appointed hour. You’re out at the landing pad a\nJODELET: little early.\nFALCO: Yeah, I suppose I am. Guess I’m on edge, Jodelet. Peace treaties, negotiations... It’s new to me. I’m not the kind of\nFALCO: chairman I thought I'd be.\nJODELET: It’s all already been taken care of in advance, sir. This\nJODELET: televised event is simply...\nFALCO: Propaganda.\nJODELET: I would prefer to say “advertising”. But that’s not what I\nJODELET: wanted to talk about. I wished to intruders are under guard in your\nFALCO: What?\nJODELET: let you know that three office.\nJODELET: An unregistered Karla, an unknown male and female... and\nJODELET: Professor Ruth Drexler.\nJODELET: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 95\nFALCO: Drexler? The space programme woman? What the hell is she doing here?\nJODELET: That’s one of the questions I intend to ask her, Mr Chairman.\nFALCO: Forget it! I’m gonna get an explanation out of her! You stay here.\nJODELET: But, sir!\nFALCO: (DEPARTING) I said stay here!\nJODELET: Director Shen-\nFALCO: Just fob her off, Jodelet, that’s what you’re good at!\nJODELET: (TO SELF) No, what I’m good at is doing all the work and staying in the shadows. Who’s the real leader here?\nJODELET: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 96\nJODELET: SCENE 65: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — LAB\nCHORDOK: Remain still, Mel.\nMEL: I wish people would stop saying that to me! Look, Chordok, you don’t need to do this!\nCHORDOK: I had hoped not.\nMEL: Don’t tell me, you’re just following orders!\nCHORDOK: No triad member can give orders to another.\nMEL: Just put down that drill and we can talk.\nCHORDOK: You have been unwilling to do so without the encouragement of the drill.\nMEL: That’s because I don’t know whatever it is you think I know, which means I can’t tell you what it is you want to hear.\nCHORDOK: I have no experience of your kind. I therefore cannot know if you are lying to me now.\nMEL: The Doctor says I’m as honest as the day is long! And we’ve been to some places with really long days!\nCHORDOK: The Doctor has long been an enemy of the my people.\nMEL: Look, I’m sure you’re wrong about that.\nCHORDOK: What has he told you of his encounters with us?\nCHORDOK: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 97\nMEL: Well... nothing, actually. But I know the Doctor, and I can promise you that all he ever wants to do is help people.\nCHORDOK: The Doctor was a party to the destruction of one of our colonies over a hundred years ago.\nMEL: I told you, I don’t know about that, but I’m sure you’re mistaken!\nCHORDOK: More recently, he took the lives of an entire military unit using the deadliest poison known to our species.\nMEL: That- That doesn’t sound like something he’d do.\nCHORDOK: Then perhaps you are incorrect when you claim to know him. To my race, he has brought nothing but death.\nCHORDOK: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 98\nCHORDOK: SCENE 66: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — OFFICE\nFALCO: Lizard people?\nRUTH: Silurians.\nFALCO: You know, Professor Drexler, my old man used to write “Tlluminati” on every banknote he had. Back when we still used paper money. I thought you of all people had more sense than he did:\nRUTH: Mr Chairman, Jodelet must have been briefed you about the Sea Base Four incident.\nFALCO: Deranged synch-operator.\nRUTH: You know that’s not true.\nFALCO: And who are these two?\nACE: I’m Ace, he’s the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Pleased to meet you, Mr Falco.\nFALCO: Mr Chairman.\nDOCTOR: Mr Chairman — we’re very concerned about our friend, and I wonder if your Karlas here would conduct a search for her?\nFALCO: Leaving me defenceless just minutes before the most important summit of our lifetime.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes. But with good reason.\nFALCO: To look for someone I’ve no way of knowing even exists.\nACE: She exists! I hope.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 99\nFALCO: I’ve seen footage of a guy named the Doctor, and he didn’t look anything like you.\nDOCTOR: I don’t photograph well, unfortunately.\nFALCO: What’s your interest in all this?\nDOCTOR: We’re just two innocent bystanders who became swept up in all the excitement. But I can confirm that everything Professor Drexler says is true.\nFALCO: Funny thing, Doctor: I don’t believe you. Are you gonna give me the same story, honey?\nACE: I’m not your honey.\nFALCO: Spunky! I love it. What I don’t love is having four intruders on this private retreat, one of whom tore apart two very expensive-to-replace Karlas.\nKARLA ONE: Their reaction times were considerably below acceptable levels.\nDOCTOR: That sounds like a boast, Karla One.\nKARLA ONE: It may be interpreted as such, but there can be no intent. My vocabulary is entirely pre-programmed.\nFALCO: Are you lot done? Because I can’t spare any more of my valuable time on you. I don’t think any of you appreciate just what I have to do today.\nRUTH: We surrendered, Mr Chairman, so we could bring you the evidence.\nFALCO: What evidence?\nSETTING: DOWN.\nSETTING: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 100\nJODELET: (D; OVER RADIO) Mr Chairman, I’m at the landing pad. Director Shen’s craft is touching down now! She’1ll no doubt want to see you!\nFALCO: In a minute, in a minute!\nFALCO: This evidence is supposed to be stored on some wristpad, right?\nFALCO: So where’s the wristpad?\nRUTH: Mel had it.\nRUTH: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 101\nRUTH: SCENE 67: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nRUTH: AVOXX AND SPENODUS’ DIALOGUE.\nCHORDOK: (D; OVER COMPUTER) Status update four hundred and twenty-seven. Work has progressed quickly since the last surgery. All difficulties regarding the human subject’s more evolved synapses have been overcome. In a very short space of time, the candidate will once again take their place as leader of the human sect, and the next stage of the triad’s plan to hasten nuclear catastrophe-\nAVVOX: This information must be deleted.\nSPENODUS: It must all be deleted, Avvox, everything!\nAVVOX: I shall notify Chordok.\nSPENODUS: Chordok is with the human prisoner. I shall deal with this.\nAVVOX: Do you have the technical knowledge, Spenodus?\nSPENODUS: I do not need “technical knowledge” to destroy this device.\nAVVOX: What do you suppose the humans wanted with the information?\nSPENODUS: Irrelevant! Their elimination will begin shortly.\nAVVOX: They penetrated our capital, but made no attempt to harm our sleeping brothers.\nSPENODUS: They did not have the opportunity, or they were simply an advance party.\nAVVOX: But what if-\nAVVOX: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 102\nSPENODUS: They are enemies of the our people, Avvox! The presence of this Doctor confirms it! He alters his appearance to confuse us, but always his motives are the same: he means to destroy us!\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 103\nSPENODUS: SCENE 68: EXT. FALCO’S RETREAT — LANDING PAD\nSHEN: WALKS TOWARDS JODELET.\nJODELET: Madam Director, it’s an honour to finally meet you.\nSHEN: Where is Chairman Falco, Mr Jodelet?\nJODELET: He is unavoidably detained.\nSHEN: Detained? This meeting was arranged many months ago, it has been planned down to the very second we are to appear together before the eyes of the world. It is important that we are seen. The people must see.\nJODELET: Yes, but.. there was an unexpected incident. A small aircraft crashed, just off the island’s coast.\nSHEN: An accident?\nJODELET: Oh yes, yes, completely accidental. A freakish coincidence, but... they do sometimes happen.\nFALCO: OK, I’m here now. We’re all ready to go.\nSHEN: Mr Chairman.\nFALCO: Madam Director. I, uh, apologise for the delay-\nJODELET: I was just informing Director Shen about the light aircraft that crashed nearby.\nFALCO: Oh yeah, that.\nSHEN: There were no survivors?\nSHEN: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 104\nFALCO: Doesn’t look like it, no.\nSHEN: Surely you have conducted a search?\nFALCO: No-one to do it, Madam Director. It’s just you, me and Jodelet on the island.\nJODELET: As per your demands. We retain only a force of security androids.\nSHEN: Then perhaps some of them might now be used to search the vicinity for the bodies of the passengers. As you see, I have brought my own security robots.\nFALCO: Riiiight. Have you ever thought of something a little more lightweight, Madam Director? Something more like a person and less like a tank?\nSHEN: Human beings are unreliable, Chairman.\nFALCO: Interesting philosophy.\nSHEN: There is still a little time before our joint broadcast. I should like to spend that time in contemplation.\nFALCO: Contemplation?\nSHEN: I view this opportunity for mutual disarmament as more than mere political expediency; on a purely personal level, it is an act of faith.\nFALCO: Faith?\nSHEN: I answer to a higher power.\nSHEN: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 105\nFALCO: Fine, fine. Jodelet here will show you to one of our guest rooms.\nSHEN: That will not be necessary. I will remain onboard my craft until required. Until then, Mr Chairman.\nFALCO: Well, that’s rude! She doesn’t even seem human! I mean, who talks like that?\nJODELET: I do, sir.\nFALCO: Yeah, whatever. I’1ll be in my office ‘til she’s got herself sorted out.\nJODELET: I hope you didn’t think me presumptuous earlier?\nFALCO: Telling her it was an accident, you mean? No, no, that was good thinking. One wrong word right now, and we’ve knackered the whole deal.\nJODELET: If you don’t mind mind me asking, sir, where are the prisoners now? There are no cells in the compound.\nFALCO: Got a bunch of Karlas guarding them in the library.\nJODELET: At least they won’t be bored.\nJODELET: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 106\nJODELET: SCENE 69: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — LIBRARY\nRUTH: None of the books in here look like they’ve ever been read, except for this one... Oh, and look what it is: Falco’s autobiography. Hey, Karlas, think fast!\nDOCTOR: Ruth, no!\nKARLA NINETEEN: Kindly do not attempt to use works of literature as offensive weapons.\nRUTH: Just testing your response times. They’re good, dammit.\nDOCTOR: Please try not to rouse them. The same goes for you too, Ace. Stop doing whatever it is you’re doing.\nACE: I’m trying to figure out which of these bookcases has a secret tunnel behind it.\nDOCTOR: That’s rather too clichéd for words, isn’t it? Come over here, we need to pool our ideas.\nACE: That all depends on whether we all want the same thing.\nRUTH: Is this what you were on about before? I think it’s time you two were honest with me.\nDOCTOR: Ace has decided secrecy is the best policy.\nACE: It doesn’t matter now. The three of us stuck here, and even if Mel is still out there somewhere, there’s no way we can get to her.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 107\nKARLA ONE: Four.\nACE: Four of us stuck here. Sorry, Karla One. So tell her, Professor. Tell her how you were planning on helping the Silurians.\nRUTH: What?\nACE: He brought us here because he wanted to give the Earth back to them.\nRUTH: Is that true?\nDOCTOR: The Silurians didn’t give up their claim to this planet. I hardly think they should be penalised for sleeping in.\nACE: They’re planning on killing the human race!\nDOCTOR: Not for the first time. But humanity has tried to wipe them out more than once.\nACE: So how were you planning on doing it?\nDOCTOR: It’s just a simple exercise in levelling the playing field, Ace, that’s all.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: SCENE 70: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — LAB\nCHORDOK: This is not what I imagined I would find myself doing when I made science my vocation, Mel. But much has happened to this world since that day.\nMEL: I understand, Chordok. You’re a man- (CORRECTS SELF) a person of learning. You’re not a torturer.\nCHORDOK: I believed that I was not.\nMEL: Then don’t let Spenodus turn you into one! You’re a scientist, you have an obligation to the truth!\nCHORDOK: You are correct, Mel. Which is why I must make all possible effort to get to the truth.\nMEL: Oh, no!\nCHORDOK: You will disclose the Doctor’s intentions!\nMEL: All right, I didn’t want to have to do this...\nMEL: . but stay back or I shoot!\nCHORDOK: Where did you acquire that weapon?\nMEL: From a robot friend of mine. Now move away from the doorway!\nCHORDOK: Much is unknown about the Doctor, but in all our accounts, one thing remains constant. Neither he nor his human companions ever use firearms.\nCHORDOK: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 109\nMEL: Was that why you didn’t search me? Look, this wasn’t exactly part of my plan, but neither was getting dissected, so out of my way!\nCHORDOK: No!\nMEL: Oh no! Chordok, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for it to go off, I just- Are you alive, please speak to me!\nAVVOX: (D; OVER RADIO) Chordok? We heard an explosion, what is happening? Respond, Chordok!\nMEL: I hope your pals know how to patch you up, Chordok, I need to get out of here. I’ve got to find the Doctor.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 110\nMEL: SCENE 71: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — LIBRARY\nDOCTOR: Honestly, Ace, I really don’t know what you’re getting so upset about.\nACE: Oh, how about because you’ve always stood up for the Earth until now?\nDOCTOR: I still am. Just not for the species that happens to be dominant at present. There was a turning point in history where man and homo-reptilia might have lived together in peace, but that time is long past.\nACE: You can’t!\nDOCTOR: Do I have to remind you about our recent disagreement with the Galparians? Having saved the world a number of times I’m now, to all intents and purposes, the legal owner of this world...\nDOCTOR: . and I have the documentation to prove it.\nACE: Gimme that!\nACE: There’s your documentation!\nDOCTOR: I also have a duplicate.\nACE: Not any more!\nDOCTOR: It really doesn’t matter, Ace, my claim has been registered in ‘Puterspace, it’s all quite legal and enforceable.

Well, Professor?\nDOCTOR: Well, what?\nACE: How do we get out of here?\nDOCTOR: Well, it just so happens-\nRUTH: Falco’s Karlas are listening.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) It just so happens that I still have the components I took from the Silurian central chamber. Gather round, please, gather round.\nACE: (SOTTO) Sonic screwdriver, Professor?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No, I’d better do this by hand, I don’t want our guards\nDOCTOR: getting suspicious.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I was planning to reverse its function, but once repaired, it should scramble the Karlas’ circuits.\nACE: (SOTTO) Including Karla One’s.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Oh yes!

Oh wait, I can’t, I’m gonna be dead.\nMEL: Dead?\nFALCO: Yeah, there’s always something. So want do you want me to do with her, Master? I figure I could choke her, maybe?\nSPENODUS: It is only right that she should be executed by a member of the triad in the traditional manner.\nAVVOX: If you attempt to kill her, Spenodus, we shall all die, and the mission can never be completed.\nSPENODUS: She attacked Chordok!\nAVVOX: Chordok lives!\nMEL: He does? Oh, thank goodness!\nAVVOX: He told me what happened. The human fired her weapon by accident. It would be an ignoble act to kill her.\nMEL: I agree, ignoble.\nAVVOX: Not when she will be soon be dead in any case.\nMEL: Wait, what?\nAVVOX: The balance of mantric energy within the candidate is extremely delicate. A single thermal unit might cause him to explode too soon.\nAVVOX: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 122\nMEL: Mantric energy... you’ve turned him into some kind of living bomb!\nFALCO: Yeah, when I go up, everyone goes up. Not the glorious Silurian triad, obviously; they’1ll be in their ship, but everyone on the island...

Make a bit of a speech about how I’m doing this for the people of the Western Bloc...\nMEL: But you’re not!\nFALCO: Doesn’t matter what’s true, Mel, it only matters what’s seen.\nSPENODUS: Total nuclear war will be assured. The human infestation will be utterly destroyed.\nAVVOX: The resultant release of radiation will be sufficient to restore power to all our cities and revive all our people, the world over.\nSPENODUS: It is fitting. Only primitive mammals would kill their own kind.\nMEL: Not if I have anything to do with it.\nFALCO: Yeah, but you don’t.\nMEL: We'll see about that!

Somehow, we’ve got to try to make them listen.\nRUTH: One of them’s a Silurian spy, and we don’t know which.\nACE: So one of us is going to be in more danger than the other. You take Karla One with you, I can look after myself.\nRUTH: I can believe it. What about the Doctor?\nACE: He’s better off where he is, trust me.\nRUTH: Looks like I’m going to have to. Wait, how do we know where to find either Falco or Shen?\nACE: I never said it was a perfect plan, I just said it was a plan.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 125\nACE: SCENE 79: INT.

Thank- you, ladies.\nMEL: (BEHIND WALL) Doctor, is that you?\nDOCTOR: Mel? Mel, you’re alive! I think. Why can’t I see you?\nMEL: (BEHIND WALL) The same reason I can’t see you. I’m behind the wall.\nMEL: (BEHIND WALL) Hear that?\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I’m coming. Now how do I...?\nMEL: (BEHIND WALL) There should be a catch somewhere in the coving.\nDOCTOR: How do you know?\nMEL: (BEHIND WALL) Believe it or not, this isn’t the first time this has happened to me today.\nDOCTOR: Got it!\nDOCTOR: Mel, you don’t know how good it is to see you!\nMEL: You too, Doctor. There’s a secret tunnel back here.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: Hidden by the bookcase. Yes, I did say to Ace I thought there might be something of the kind.\nMEL: Where is Ace?\nDOCTOR: Around. I hope you don’t mind if I join you back there?\nMEL: I’d sooner join you in there. Doctor, we’ve got to stop Falco, he’s the one controlled by the Silurians! I’m running from them right now!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 129\nMEL: SCENE 81: INT.

Come along.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: SCENE 82: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — CONFERENCE ROOM\nFALCO: So.. Madam Director... I see everything’s been laid out for us. Jodelet’s even got the agreements open on the right page.\nSHEN: Are you psychologically prepared, Mr Chairman?\nFALCO: How did you-? Yeah, totally prepared.\nSHEN: Is your aide controlling the cameras?\nFALCO: Aw, no. They’1ll come on automatically, direct feed to both blocs.

FALCO’S RETREAT — CORRIDOR\nRUTH: What I’d give right now for a map with a little arrow saying “You are here”.\nACE: We’re running out of time, Ruth.\nRUTH: I know. We’re going to have to confront Shen and Falco together. First thing we’ve got to- (SOTTO) Wait!\nACE: (SOTTO) What?\nRUTH: (SOTTO) I think we’ve found their meeting room. That door’s guarded. Two robots. Look round the corner — carefully!\nACE: (SOTTO) What are they? They’re not like the Karlas.\nRUTH: (SOTTO) They must be Shen’s bodyguards.\nACE: (SOTTO) They could make a Dalek feel inadequate.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 132\nACE: SCENE 84: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — CAVES\nDOCTOR: You know, I always suspected the sea base invasion might be used as a prelude to something larger.\nMEL: I don’t know anything about any of this, remember.\nDOCTOR: It was several lifetimes ago for me.\nMEL: And about a hundred years in my future.\nDOCTOR: The Silurians attempted to launch a proton missile and trigger a final world war.\nMEL: You think it was just meant to bring the two world leaders together?\nDOCTOR: Probably this was their back-up plan. An elegant piece of gamesmanship!\nMEL: “Elegant”? You mean horrific. Doctor, one of them’s a walking mantric bomb!\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 133\nMEL: SCENE 85: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — CORRIDOR\nACE: (SOTTO) We can’t just stay here.\nRUTH: (SOTTO) I agree, but there doesn’t seem to be any way of getting past those- things.\nACE: (SOTTO) So now what do we do?\nKARLA ONE: (AT FULL VOLUME) I might act as a diversion.\nKARLA ONE: TRACKS AND APPROACH.\nACE: Do you have a whisper setting or something?\nKARLA ONE: Whisper setting is available on Platinum Karlas only.\nACE: Run!\nACE: ITSELF TO RUTH.\nRUTH: (CHOKING) Ace!\nRUTH: (CHOKING) They’ve got me, Ace!\nRUTH: (CHOKING) It’s a line... they’re reeling me in!\nACE: Karla One, can you snap the line?\nKARLA ONE: The tensile strength is greater than any resistance I could bring to bear.\nKARLA ONE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 134\nKARLA ONE: I, too, have been restrained.\nJODELET: What the hell’s going on here? I thought you were supposed to be locked in the library.\nACE: We read everything. Let them go!\nJODELET: You’re joking. There’s a lot at stake here.\nACE: You’re right about that. We need to see the leaders.\nJODELET: I’m sure you do. But you’re not going to get that opportunity.\nACE: Now listen, mate-\nJODELET: You listen!\nJODELET: Put your hands up! This moment is too important for you to try\nJODELET: and interfere!\nRUTH: (CHOKING) Karla One... can you still move your arm?\nKARLA ONE: Affirmative.\nRUTH: (CHOKING) Then shoot his wrist!\nACE: I’1ll take your gun.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 135\nACE: Nice shooting, Karla One.\nKARLA ONE: The wound is disabling but not fatal.\nJODELET: It feels fatal! You two robots, shoot her!\nACE: Try it and I shoot him!\nJODELET: You wouldn’t!\nACE: How many extra holes do you want in you Open it!\nRUTH: (CHOKING) You’re on your own, Ace.\nACE: today?

Jodelet, you let her escape?\nJODELET: Not... exactly, sir.\nACE: Sit down!\nSHEN: Mr Chairman, I had your assurance that we three were the only persons on the island.\nFALCO: Yeah, that was a lie. But told with the best of intentions.\nFALCO: This woman claimed she was a survivor of that crash. But the gun in her hand says otherwise. Jodelet, tell me that’s not\nFALCO: your gun.\nJODELET: I’m sorry... Mr Chairman.\nFALCO: OK, when this is over, you’re out of here.\nSHEN: Mr Falco, you have violated the terms of our agreement. I am leaving immediately.\nFALCO: I don’t think she’s going to let you.\nACE: Stay where you are!\nFALCO: Y’see? Besides, the broadcast’s due to start any moment. Looks like the punters are gonna get more than they bargained for.\nFALCO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 137\nFALCO: SCENE 87: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nAVVOX: The moment is almost upon us, Spenodus.\nSPENODUS: Our restoration begins. This is a great day, Avvox, a turning- point in history.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but history has so many turning-points, it can start to look like an ornamental maze.\nSPENODUS: You!\nDOCTOR: Me!\nMEL: And me. How’s your face? I am sorry about that, but you were planning on killing me.\nSPENODUS: I have no reason not to!\nDOCTOR: Except that we surrender unconditionally to the might of the Silurian triad. You’re not going to execute us without due process, are you?\nAVVOX: You know of our customs.\nDOCTOR: I’ve had occasion to study them, Avvox — that’s what your colleague said your name was, I think?\nSPENODUS: Such laws have no meaning when the prisoners are armed and pose a threat.\nMEL: The last person I posed a threat to was the reigning Pease Pottage roller disco champion. And we’re definitely not armed.\nSPENODUS: You forced your way onto our vessel.\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR: With the aid of a few wires from a deceased robotic friend, see.\nAVVOX: Chordok will wish to question him.\nSPENODUS: When he is recovered. He was the first of our triad to be injured by your companion, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mel, I am shocked.\nMEL: I’m not especially proud of myself today. I never meant to hurt Chordok.\nDOCTOR: If it’s any consolation, no-one else will get hurt today.\nAVVOX: You will be unable to keep that promise, Doctor. In a few minutes, the two human leaders will be destroyed.\nSPENODUS: The first of millions.\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t think so. I may not be armed, but those wires aren’t the only thing I keep in my pockets. Perhaps you recognise this...\nAVVOX: That is our technology!\nDOCTOR: I appropriated certain components from the central chamber in your city. Now — I expect your friend Chordok could tell you how easily this device could be altered to suppress the spread of mantric energy...?\nSPENODUS: Lies!\nDOCTOR: No, Spenodus. I’m afraid your plans have come to a sudden stop. There’1ll be no more deaths.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: SCENE 88: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — CONFERENCE ROOM\nSHEN: Put the weapon down, child.\nACE: Shut up! Which of you is the Silurian agent?\nFALCO: She can’t tell you that if she shuts up, Ace. Think it through.\nACE: One of you is under Silurian control! I don’t know what you’re planning, but I won’t let it happen! I won’t let the Silurians take this planet!\nSHEN: Who are the Silurians?\nFALCO: A superior race, who ruled over the Earth when we were just rodents. Now they want it back, and that seems totally fair to me. I mean, you wouldn’t want to share your place with rodents, would you? No, you’d put down poison.\nACE: It’s you. You’re the one.\nFALCO: Well, yeah. Wait, are we on yet? (CHECKS WATCH) Still a couple of minutes. Right now, there isn’t the power to reawaken the billions of so-called Silurians in hibernation across the world.\nSHEN: Billions?\nFALCO: Oh, for sure. But when I kill the Director of the Eastern Bloc-\nSHEN: How do you propose to kill me? She is the only one who is armed.\nFALCO: Oh, don’t you worry, Madam Director, I’m loaded for bear alright.\nFALCO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 140\nFALCO: SCENE 89: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: Now we have a little time, perhaps you should listen to my proposal.\nSPENODUS: You have nothing to offer us, human!\nDOCTOR: Ah, but I’m not human. You should have some idea of the average hominid’s life expectancy, yes?\nAVVOX: Correct, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You should also have records of my encounter with your people in the year eighteen-thirty-five. Do you know of any humans with a lifespan of over two hundred and fifty years? Well?\nSPENODUS: Do not indulge him, Avvox!\nDOCTOR: I exist outside the normal flow of time. One of the advantages of such an existence is that you see everything in hindsight, including the fate of this planet.\nAVVOX: Its fate?\nSPENODUS: Avvox!\nSPENODUS: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 141\nSPENODUS: SCENE 90: INT. FALCO’S RETREAT — CONFERENCE ROOM\nFALCO: I wonder whether I’11 feel it when it happens, or whether I’11l just — poof! — vapourize. Jodelet, how you doin’ over there?\nFALCO: You holding up alright?\nJODELET: Yes... Sir.\nFALCO: It’ll be over soon.\nSHEN: He is mad.\nFALCO: I’m not mad, honey, I’m just brainwashed. And honestly, I’ve never felt better. All I ever wanted to do was build a better, safer world.\nACE: By starting a war that’1l kill everyone?\nFALCO: Not everyone. Not the Silurians. That was where I went wrong from the start, I see that now. The human race just isn’t worth saving. The world’s meant for something more.\nSHEN: Shoot him!\nACE: What?\nSHEN: You have the gun, kill him!\nFALCO: She’s right. You should kill me. I don’t mind. Maybe it’1l stop me going up, maybe it won’t. Honestly I don’t know. But it’s got to be worth a shot, so to speak.\nSHEN: Do it! Kill him now!\nSHEN: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 142\nACE: I don’t... know...\nFALCO: You can do it, Ace. That’s one of my models, it’s crazy easy to use. Just squeeze that trigger.\nACE: Why do you want me to?\nFALCO: It’s not for me, it’s for them.\nACE: The Silurians?\nFALCO: Not the Silurians, them.\nFALCO: Cameras are on. Greetings, folks at home. You know me, Chairman Bart Falco. Over there is Director Shen, and this here is an assassin, an agent of the Eastern Bloc.\nACE: That’s a lie!\nFALCO: Well, she would say that, wouldn’t she?\nFALCO: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 143\nFALCO: SCENE 91: INT. SILURIAN SHIP — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: Many centuries from now, the Earth will be ravaged by solar flares. Humanity abandons the planet.\nMEL: They do?\nDOCTOR: You must return to hibernation. For now.\nSPENODUS: To awaken and inherit a ball of ash? You think little of us, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: That’s not what I’m offering, Spenodus. The world eventually heals itself and the human race returns from the stars to reclaim their home.\nSPENODUS: It is not their home!\nMEL: I was born here!\nDOCTOR: At that point, the Earth won’t belong to anybody. It’s anyone’s for the taking.\nSPENODUS: Why wait to destroy them in the future, when we can destroy them now?\nDOCTOR: No, that’s not what I- Avvox, do you understand?\nAVVOX: I believe I do, Doctor. You propose my people are revived at the same rate as the humans return?\nDOCTOR: A completely level playing field. No one side has the advantage, both have equal claim to the Earth.\nSPENODUS: Our people will never surrender!\nAVVOX: There can be no surrender where there is no conflict, Spenodus.\nAVVOX: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 144\nSPENODUS: This is treason!\nMEL: Actually, it sounds more like co-habitation.\nDOCTOR: If both races are prepared to trust and respect one another.\nSPENODUS: The humans are undeserving of our respect! We could walk on the surface now, but you would have us wait hundreds of years?\nDOCTOR: Actually, it’s more like thousands.\nMEL: Er.. That may not be the best selling point, Doctor.\nSPENODUS: I have grown tired of your babbling! Avvox, the controls! Overload the candidate’s energy levels, activate the mantric bomb!\nDOCTOR: That won’t do you any good, Spenodus. Remember the particle\nDOCTOR: suppressor.\nSPENODUS: I do not believe that device even works!\nMEL: Don’t be ridiculous! The Doctor would never resort to such a desperate ruse- (TO DOCTOR) It’s not true, is it?\nDOCTOR: I was hoping the subterfuge would last a little longer.\nSPENODUS: Deceitful creature!\nAVVOX: Spenodus, no!\nAVVOX: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 145\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I take it that’s a “no”, then?\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR: SCENE 92: INT.

Do it, girl!\nJODELET: I have to agree, miss, please kill him.\nACE: I just- need to think, why won’t anyone let me think!\nFALCO: Ladies and gentlemen... and of course, all you kids... This is an historic moment.\nACE: Shut up!\nFALCO: Our enemies in the Eastern Bloc have effectively declared war on us all by threatening your Chairman.\nSHEN: These are lies! You are deranged, Falco.\nFALCO: Everybody’s out to shoot Bart Falco. Folks at home, this is not the first time today your Chairman has had a gun at his head; earlier on, an Eastern Bloc agent by the name of Mel had me in her sights.\nACE: Mel?\nFALCO: Mm-hm. Proper ruthless little minx, she was. Never trust a redhead.\nACE: Mel... The nicest person in the whole universe.. And you got her to point a gun at you?\nFALCO: What’s your point, sweetheart?

Listen to her, Spenodus.\nSPENODUS: You will not activate the control?\nAVVOX: I will not. I cannot.\nSPENODUS: Then I shall!\nMEL: No, you can’t!\nDOCTOR: Mel, don’t!\nSPENODUS: Do not attempt to stop me, filthy creature!\nMEL: I can’t let you start a war! Why can’t you see this is wrong-\nSPENODUS: Away!\nSPENODUS: Disgusting mammal! You dare to scratch the scales of a superior being!

Only primitive mammals... kill their own... kind.\nAVVOX: Forgive me, my husband.\nDOCTOR: Avvox, I’m so... I’m so sorry. I never meant for this to happen.\nAVVOX: It is a day for sorrow, Doctor. And a day for apologies.\nMEL: She’s right, Doctor. You promised me no-one else was going to get hurt.\nMEL: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 150\nMEL: SCENE 94: INT.

Why are you holding that gun?\nACE: Why-? I don’t know. Does anybody else want this? There might be some bullets left.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 151\nJODELET: I’1ll take it. Mr Chairman... Come with me, please.\nFALCO: Yeah, I think that’s- I’d like that. I wanted to explode, you know.\nJODELET: I know, sir.\nFALCO: Why-why-why would anybody want that?\nJODELET: I’m sure I couldn’t say, sir. Come with me, please.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Mr Jodelet... some of my friends are having a little difficulty with a security robot. Would you mind releasing them?\nJODELET: Of course.\nSHEN: I am due an explanation from someone.\nDOCTOR: I entirely agree, but Mel and I are hardly the people to give nh oa\nACE: Well, I’ve got a thing or two to say.\nDOCTOR: And perhaps a thing or two to hear, Ace. May I introduce you to a recent acquaintance of mine...\nAVVOX: Madam Director.\nACE: Blimey.\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 152\nAVVOX: My name is Avvox. I represent homo reptilia.\nDOCTOR: I believe the two of you have a good deal to talk about.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 153\nDOCTOR: SCENE 95: EXT. FALCO’S RETREAT — SHORELINE\nRUTH: There are bound to be people from both Blocs on their way here right now.\nDOCTOR: I don’t envy you the explanations you’1ll have to give over the next few days.\nRUTH: The big question is, what do we do about Falco? He can’t be allowed to stay in power.\nDOCTOR: Remember, Ruth, the one in charge isn’t necessarily the one who wields the power. I think Mr Jodelet will ensure that the transfer of title of Chairman goes smoothly.\nRUTH: I bet he will. Maybe he can arrange a jet to fly you all to Motuo.\nDOCTOR: Thank-you, but there’s no need. Avvox and Chordok have agreed to give us a lift back...\nDOCTOR: There they are now! Goodbye, Professor. Do give my best wishes\nDOCTOR: to Karla One.\nRUTH: She won’t appreciate it.\nDOCTOR: All the same. And remember to always have faith.\nRUTH: In what? The future?\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR: SCENE 96: INT. CENTRAL CHAMBER\nCHORDOK: The future of our race is in your hands, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, these hands — which are presently setting the controls for you to be awakened in the year sixteen-oh-eighty-seven — don’t belong to a human. I have no quarrel with either species.\nAVVOX: Lay back, Chordok. We shall not see one another for some time.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, I truly wish Spenodus could be joining you in his capsule.\nAVVOX: I, too, Doctor. More than you can ever know. For now, I wish to sleep. When next my eyes open, they shall look upon a new world.\nDOCTOR: It’s the best therapy, Avvox. Take it from one who’s seen a few.\nDOCTOR: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: SCENE 97: EXT. MOTUO JUNGLE — OUTSIDE THE TARDIS\nMEL: Here he comes. Everything alright?\nDOCTOR: At this precise moment in Earth’s history, far from it. But I suspect it shall be.\nMEL: In time.\nDOCTOR: That’s where all the answers are, Mel.\nMEL: You know, if they’d wanted to be woken up a bit earlier, Avvox and Chordok could have used the radiation from the solar flares to revive their entire species.\nDOCTOR: I realise that. I find it quite encouraging that they didn’t ask about it.\nMEL: I’1ll be in the TARDIS, boxing up my language tapes. Don’t be too long.\nACE: Here, you’1ll be wanting your sonic screwdriver back.\nDOCTOR: Why, thank you, Ace.\nACE: So.. Are we done?\nDOCTOR: With the Silurians, you mean?\nACE: You tell me. It’s like you expect me to prove myself to you, over and over again. How does somebody get to be nine hundred years old and still be so insecure?\nACE: #229: THE SILURIAN CANDIDATE by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR: It’s true, I expect a lot of you, Ace. But not too much, never too much.\nACE: What’s that supposed to mean?\nDOCTOR: It means I have faith in the future. And in you."
