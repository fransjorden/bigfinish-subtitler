      "searchable_dialogue": "MAGGIE: How is he?\nSKREDSVIG: He is sleeping, but I have never seen a man so tortured in his sleep. His brow furrows constantly. It is as if some great turmoil rages within him.\nMAGGIE: Did he say anything about what was troubling him? Has he spoken to you at all?\nSKREDSVIG: He has spoken for some time about painting the memories of a sunset. He talks about the sky being red like blood — no, he believes that it really is blood. Coagulated blood. No one else would see it that way, ali they would see are clouds. But if you talk to Edvard about it... (he sighs) Something has consumed him with fear.\nMAGGIE: But what? What could have caused this malaise?\nSKREDSVIG: He talks of a trip to Ekebergasen. He says that he was walking along the road with two friends. He was feeling tired and so he stopped, looking out over the fjord, watching the sunset. He says that the sky suddenly turned red, that blood and tongues of fire hung over the town. His friends walked on, they saw nothing, but Edvard was left trembling with fear. He claims that he heard a scream — an infinite scream passing through nature. The sadness that we see in him is because the humble means available to art are not enough for him to put that experience onto canvas. He is striving for the impossible and has despair as his religion.\nMAGGIE: What did you advise him?\nSKREDSVIG: This scream is still in his head so I advised him to paint it.\nSKREDSVIG: A storm, but it isn’t rain battering the windows ~ it’s dust. The wind is ferocious and there is an eerie drawn out howl - a constant background scream. (Every scene set on this planet should have the same constant background atmospheric to a greater or lesser extent.) Above the storm we hear the burbling of a radio transmitter. A distress beacon starts to sound.\nTECHNICIAN: (Frantic) Mayday! This is third technician Jay Binks on Refuelling Station B calling Duchamp control! Come in control! Can you hear me? They're dead. Do you hear, everyone dead! Killed by the dust. By the damn dust I tell you! (Calmer) It's everywhere, can you hear it, Contrel? Hear it on the wind? It’s trying to get in!\nTECHNICIAN: A window smashes. The wind and screaming increases in pace.\nTECHNICLAN: Did you hear that? It knows I’m in here! It wants to smother me, smother me like all the others.\nTECHNICLAN: The wind is deafening now. More windows smash.\nTECHNICLAN: TECHNICIAN The planet is alive! It wants us all dead! AAAAAAAGH!\nTECHNICLAN: 145\nTECHNICLAN: There is a terrifying gurgling scream above the noise, and then just wind and the beacon...\nTECHNICLAN: The familiar background hum of the ship in flight. Footsteps...\nACE: (Hushed) Professor? THE DOCTOR Ah, there you are, Ace. What kept you?\nACE: (Hushed) It’s a long way from the control room.”\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes.\nACE: (Hushed) And I didn’t know the TARDIS had an art gallery...\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Whispering) Why are you whispering?\nACE: Because it feels like a museum, or a library. Somewhere serious.\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Suddenly loud) Nonsense. This is my play room. In you 60...\nACE: A door swishes open. They enter an echoey, cavernous sounding space.\nACE: What’s this, an explosion in a glass factory?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Terileptil sculpture. Such a talented race, if only they’d stick to art. Such a pity... (perky) Have you seen my Mona Lisa? It’s just down here... He sets off, Ace in tow.\nACE: Your Mona, Lisa? THE DOCTOR Yes, you remember, Ace, I told you. Leonardo actually painted seven of them. I managed to pick one up as a souvenir”\nACE: Is it the Mona Lisa? THE DOCTOR Well it’s not the one with ‘This is a Fake’ written under the paint in felt tip. That one’s in the Louvre...\nACE: Hey... Hey, hold up, Professor, what’s this doing here? THE DOCTOR Ah... The Night Watch.\nACE: Doctor, I remember this from ‘O’ level art. It’s by that Dutch dloke...* THE DOCTOR Rembrandt.\nACE: It’s meant to be one of the greatest pictures of all time. THE DOCTOR Yes, it is rather good isn't it? I picked it up from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in the 33rd Century. AC CAppalled) You stole it? THE DOCTOR No, no, no! Of course not!? The museum burned down. I nipped in there an hour or so beforehand. I rescued it. That’s how I got most of my collection.\nACE: You stole them. THE DOCTOR Rescued them!\nACE: You hang around waiting for museums and art galleries\nACE: to burn down or whatever - and then you loot them. It’s like grave robbing.\nACE: THE DOCTOR They would have been destroyed.\nACE: So why don't you return them? re DOCTOR What? And alter the course of history?\nACE: Huh! That’s always an argument you love to use when it ate you... (pause) So I assume we're off to nick another masterpiece, then. THE DOCTOR Nick?\nACE: 146\nACE: Rescue, then. From where, exactly?\nACE: THE DOCTOR A backwater planet called Duchamp 331. Not a very pleasant place I'm afraid, but there’s a little something that I want to pick up.\nACE: ACE A little something that will sit in this gap.° THEDOCTOR Yes...\nACE: (Reading) The Scream, by Edvard Munch.”\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes. According to my diary, it’s about to vanish in Inysterious circumstances...\nACE: 4, EXT. REFUELLING STATION A - DAY\nACE: The same howling wind and screaming as before. Not as ferocious, but distant and constant. A door hisses open. There is a distant echoing tannoy voice.\nCOMPUTER: VOICE This is Duchamp Control. AH staff on Duchamp Refuelling Base A are reminded we are on stage two storm alert. Full filtration and dust contamination procedures will be observed until further notice. Control out.\nBEV: TARRANT Of all the God-forsaken planets to get stranded on... You pick ’em Bev. You really pick ‘em.\nGUTHRIE: Heh! Got the dust blues girl?\nBEV: TARRANT Blue would be a relief. It’s just so bleak. All this rolling grey. Endless... You must be Guthrie.\nGUTHRIE: If you say so, then that’s who I must be.\nBEV: TARRANT I'm Tarrant, Bev Tarrant.\nGUTHRIE: Good to meet you girl. (He hawks up and spits) Be proud to shake yer hand.\nBEV: TARRANT Charming.\nGUTHRIE: Heh, attagiri. Spit’s a precious commodity on Duchamp. Everything’s so dry — inside and out. Dust. Gets right up the crack of\nBEV: TARRANT Quite.\nGUTHRIE: Yer not one of the freighter crew, are you, what’s a girl like you...?\nBEV: TARRANT Doing on a dump like this? (She laughs) Bad luck, and lots of it. Got caught out by a border patrol and had to make a long hyperjump. Came out in this system with a blown hyperdrive and no fuel. (She laughs humourlessly) Six of the biggest fuel dumps in the entire sector and I've got nothing to pay for it with.\nGUTHRIE: I wouldn't say that... you’re a damn fine looking woman...\nBEV: TARRANT And you can forget any ideas like that...\nGUTHRIE: (Gives a hacking laugh) No harm in tryin’...\nBEV: TARRANT (Pause, then) They tell me you’ve been here twenty years, Guthrie. That you were here with the construction crews and you just keep extending your tour of duty. Why do you stay?\nGUTHRIE: Me? Wouldn't live anywhere else. Been here since the beginning. Gonna stay till the end. (Pause) How old are you, girl?\nBEV: TARRANT That's no question to ask a lady.\nGUTHRIE: How old?\nBEV: TARRANT Twenty nine.\nGUTHRIE: Only twenty nine, eh? That’s rough. Duchamp’s no place\nGUTHRIE: 147\nGUTHRIE: for the young. We're all ancient here. Old before our time. Aged by the dust. No one young ever comes here. :\nBEV: TARRANT You get the long haul pilots. Ships are always refuelling here.\nGUTHRIE: But no one stays. Not for long. They’re always quick to leave Duchamp. (He cackles) This is where they send you to die, girl.\nGUTHRIE: SALVADORI- Klemp? Klemp! Oh, curse the man, where is he? (Belliowing) Klemp!\nKLEMP: (Off) Coming, Madame Salvadori.\nSALVADORI: Ah, there you are Klemp. Where the devil have you been?\nKLEMP: Well ma’am... (taps at a keypad)\nSALVADORI: No, don’t bother, already I can feel waves of boredom sweeping over me. What of the preparations? Is the good ship ‘Gallery’ ready to embark on its great adventure to Duchamp 331?\nKLEMP: Almost. Madame Salvadori, we are just waiting for one passenger.\nSALVADORI: Waiting for a passenger! Heavens man, we can’t delay the most prestigious social event of the decade for one passenger. Tell the captain to leave without him.\nKLEMP: Ah, it is a rather special passenger, ma’am. Our mysterious benefactor, Mr Seta...\nSALVADORI: Ah... Well in that case... (conspiratorially) Have you made any headway in uncovering his identity, Klemp, or the nature of his mysterious and, no doubt, very expensive cargo?\nKLEMP: I’m afraid not, Madame Salvadori. (Taps at a keypad) All investigations have met with rather... limited success.\nSALVADORI: Oh, you’re useless, I really don’t know why I keep you.\nKLEMP: No, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: Very well, Klemp, hurry along.”\nKLEMP: Yes, ma'am.\nSALVADORI: Oh, Klemp. Before you go. What do you think of the outfit?\nKLEMP: Well...\nSALVADORI: Come on, man, speak up.\nKLEMP: Well you will clash with the hors d’csuvres if you wear that particular shade of green, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: Oh, away with you, Klemp. Out, out! Shoo! (Bellowing) And bring me back something that is purple! (Hxasperated) Oh, why is nothing ever easy?!\nSALVADORI: The Doctor and Ace approach from the access corridor.\nACE: (Distant) So where is the God-forsaken planet?\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Entering the contro] room) In the middle of the major freight shipping routes. It’s a way station. A refuelling post for spacecraft carrying supplies to the new frontier.\nACE: ACE And they decided that was a good place for an art gallery? They must run a good bus service.\nACE: THEDOCTOR (Exasperated) There is a colony of independent artists\nACE: 148\nACE: and musicians who decided that Duchamp 331 was the perfect getaway from the rest of society.\nACE: Oh, great. Hippies.'”\nACE: THE DOCTOR Really Ace...\nACE: There is a bleep from the console, and the distress beacon from earlier.\nACE: Hey, what's that?\nACE: THE DOCTOR A distress beacon. Very faint.\nACE: He punches at controls.\nACE: ACE A ship...\nACE: THEDOCTOR No, it’s a planetary beacon... How interesting. It’s from Duchamp 331.\nACE: Professor, I don’t suppose your diary mentions exactly how this painting of yours mysteriously vanished?\nACE: THE DOCTOR No, it was rather vague.\nACE: So we’re just jumping in feet first as usual. THE DOCTOR Exactly!\nACE: Marvellous!\nACE: THE DOCTOR Honestly, Ace! Where’s your sense of adventure? The TARDIS starts to make its familiar landing noises.\nACE: Above the wind and constant faint background screaming the TARDIS starts to materialise. The door opens and the Doctor and Ace emerge. There is the bleep of a handheld device and the noise of the beacon\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes, this is the place. The signal’s getting weaker though.\nACE: God, look at this place. (Reading) ‘Duchamp Corporation Refuelling Station B. Capacity twenty thousand tonnes.’ (She coughs) This dust... THE DOCTOR (Thoughtfully) Yes... the entire planet is dust. The refuelling bases sit on the fuel reservoir tanks floating beneath the surface, Technologically they’re quite an achievement.\nACE: It doesn't look much like a technological achievement at the moment. It looks like a bomb hit it. THE DOCTOR Yes, it’s strange, the building looks like it was blown in... The force of the wind must have been phenomenal.\nACE: It’s not exactly a summer breeze at the moment. THE DOCTOR Come on. This way... Carefully. This roof could come in any minute.”\nACE: What’s that awful screaming noise? aoe DOCTOR (Thoughtfully) I’m not sure, Ace. I’m not sure.\nACE: Well whatever it is it’s getting louder. wid Tattles the walls. THE DOCTOR The signal is coming from in here, Ace. Ace?\nACE: (Quietly) Doctor... Look. Over there, under the dust. It looks like a body THE DOCTOR Yes... and there, another. And another\nACE: Doctor, they’re all dead, aren’t they? THE DOCTOR Someone set that distress beacon going.\nACE: Then why did no one come?\nACE: THE DOCTOR I don't know, Ace. Perhaps the signal was too weak. Perhaps this dust is blanketing things somehow.\nACE: 149\nACE: Another gust of wind rattles the base.\nACE: Come on, Doctor, let’s get out of here.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Perhaps you're right.\"\nACE: There is a moan of pain from nearby.\nACE: Doctor...?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Ace, over here.\nACE: TECHNICIAN The dust...\nACE: THE DOCTOR It’s all right. We're going to help.\nTECHNICIAN: No escape. The dust...\nTECHNICIAN: The wind slams in again, the screaming louder.\nACE: It’s getting worse!\nACE: THE DOCTOR Quick, help me with him.\nACE: They struggle to lift the man. There is a crash as a wall collapses. The screaming is loud now.\nTECHNICIAN: It will kill us all!’\nTECHNICIAN: ACE The entire place is coming down!\nTECHNICIAN: THE DOCTOR Ace! Get the TARDIS door open!\nTECHNICIAN: The TARDIS door opens and they bundle inside. The storm is filled with the sound of the TARDIS dematerialising.\nACE: That was close...\nTECHNICIAN: (Weak) No escape... from the dust...\nTECHNICIAN: THE DOCTOR How’s he doing?\nACE: I can’t see anything obviously wrong with him... He’s unconscious again. What are we going to do with him, Professor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR There are five other refuelling bases on the planet. We'll let his own people take care of him.\"®\nACE: What do you think happened back there?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Mysterious circumstances...\nACE: The clink of glasses and a steady buzz of background conversation. A door opens.\nBEV: TARRANT Vodka martini. A dry one.\nGUTHRIE: Heh! That won't shut the world out!\nBEV: TARRANT No, but it might help dull the edges a little. You got a light, Guthrie?\nGUTHRIE: Sure. (There is the klunk of an old-style lighter) Dangerous habit on a refuelling base.'°\nBEV: TARRANT You're the one with the lighter.\nGUTHRIE: I keeps it for... sentimental reasons.'”\nBEV: TARRANT Right. (She drinks) Any news from the radio room yet? Have they got through to anyone or are we still cut off?\nGUTHRIE: Still the same. Static and ghost signals. Always the same when it’s like this. We'll get nothing till this storm blows itself out. Be patient, girl. It will all be the same tomorrow.\nBEV: TARRANT That’s the problem. I just don't know how you do it\nBEV: Guthrie. Day in day out, the same old routine. Endless, mind numbing monotony...\nBEV: 150\nBEV: The noise of the TARDIS materialising fills the room. @ What in tarnation...?!\nBEV: The door opens.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Good afternoon. I'm the...\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor! Ace!\nACE: Bev!\nBEV: TARRANT I don't believe it! I just don’t believe it!\nGUTHRIE: (Cackling) Well if that don’t take the biscuit. You’ve got\nGUTHRIE: some clever friends, girl...\nBEV: TARRANT What the hell are you doing here?\nACE: That’s a very long story...\nACE: THE DOCTOR That can wait for the moment. We've got an injured man who needs medical attention. Would you mind if we used your sickbay?\nACE: The rhythmic background beep of medical equipment.\nACE: THE DOCTOR There...\nACE: Is he going to be all right?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Oh yes, I think so. These autodoc units are very efficient. He should be back on his feet in a couple of hours. Then perhaps he can tell us what happened.\nBEV: TARRANT Who is he?\nYHE: DOCTOR Jay Binks, according to his ID. A junior refuelling technician on Duchamp Station B.'°\nBEV: TARRANT That's about fifty kilometres away. What happened?\nACE: Dunno. We picked up a distress signal. Went to investigate. The base was trashed. (Pause) Everyone else was dead.\nBEV: TARRANT Jeez...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR How come the distress signal wasn't received here?\nBEV: TARRANT Communications are shot to hell. This storm. Something in the dust apparently.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes...\nBEV: TARRANT Look there's nothing else we can do here. Let me get you a drink, and you can tell me what brings you to Duchamp 331 of all places.\nACE: You coming, Professor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes, yes, I'll be right there.\nACE: The door opens and Bev and Ace leave.\nBEV: TARRANT (Distant) It’s good to see you again, Ace...\nACE: (Distant) Where did you go after Kar-Charrat?\nBEV: TARRANT (Distant) Oh, you wouldn't believe it... but at least it was free of Daleks...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Mysterious) Something in the dust? Or the dust itself...\nBEV: The chatter of a lot of people. Muted classical music, clinking champagne glasses. A knife taps on a glass.\nKLEMP: Ladies and Gentlemen. Your attention please. (The room\nKLEMP: quietens) Your host, Madame Elsa Salvadori. Applause.\nKLEMP: 151\nSALWVADORI: Thank you, thank you, you are too kind. On behalf of Salvadori Entertainment — welcome! Welcome to ‘Gallery’! The most luxurious space liner ever built. I have promised each and every one of you the opportunity to bid for priceless works of art from across the known universe, but I also promise that this trip will prove unforgettable in other ways. I have commissioned a piece of art so stupendous, so unique, that all your purchases will seem shallow and ordinary in comparison. ‘Gallery’ is about to set out on a little journey, and at its end lies wonder. In the meantime, enjoy yourselves. Hat, drink and, above all,\nSALWVADORI: spend! More appiause. And the music starts up again.\nKLEMP: Wonderful, ma'am. Inspiring.\nSALVADORI: Thank you, Klemp. I thought so.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER (His voice slightly muffled by the mask he wears — as indeed it must be until he reveals himself halfway through Scene 42) Bravo. Madame Salvadori. A most impressive speech.\nSALVADORI: Oh. Mr Seta. You startled me. I trust you are being well looked after.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Everything is quite satisfactory. Your staff are being most... cooperative.\nSALVADORI: After the help you have given in funding this little excursion it is the least we can do. I must admit though, to being impatient to see quite what treasures you have brought on board.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER 0h, I assure you, Madame Salvadori, when you see what 1 have to offer, it will quite take your breath away. (He gives a racking cough)\nSALVADORI: Heavens. Are you quite all right?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER It will pass. The journey here has left me weary. If you will excuse me. Madame. Mr Klemp.\nSALVADORI: (Conspiratorially) How much do you think that mask he wears is worth, Klemp?\nKLEMP: (Taps at a keypad) The analyser puts the gemstones alone at three million, ma'am.\nSALVADORI: Mysterious and wealthy... I am so looking forward to getting to know our Mr Seta. Come along Klemp, we are neglecting our other guests. Mingle, mingle, mingle!\nSALVADORI: They bustle off.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER (To himself) You will know me soon enough, Madame Salvadori. Soon enough...\nSALVADORI: The chatter of crew.\nBEV: TARRANT ...so that’s it. Managed to get the idol, lose the patrols, and limp this far.\nACE: You could have picked a, better planet to crash on. I mean. What a dump!\nBEV: TARRANT I didn’t have a lot of choice! There aren’t that many Planets out this far!\nBEV: Wind rattles the windows, the distant screaming echoes around.\nACE: What is that noise?\nGUTHRIE: That's the noise of Dalek madness!\nGUTHRIE: 152\nACE: You what?\nBEV: TARRANT Ace, meet resident nutter, Guthrie. If he asks to shake your hand, decline.\nACE: Wotcha.\nGUTHRIE: They all laugh. But old Guthrie knows the truth.\nACE: What truth?\nGUTHRIE: Way back. Way before man decided that he had a use for Duchamp 331, they came here.\nACE: Daleks?\nGUTHRIE: Yup.” Crippled they were. Crippled from a fire fight out\nGUTHRIE: on the rim. They thought they’d land and make repairs, but they didn’t reckon on the dust. Dragged them down it did, the entire saucer, buried \"em alive. Somewhere down there they are. Inside the planet, in the dust. No light, no sound, no nothin’ - enough to send any creature mad that\nGUTHRIE: 2? Even them tin tyrants, and now on nights like this you can hear their screams on the wind. Dalek madness... The wind rattles the windows again.\nBEV: TARRANT Take no notice of him. The screams are from the only indigenous species on this hell-hole. Locals cali them dust sharks. The young scream when they’re hungry, but Guthrie sticks to his story... Don’t you Guthrie?\nGUTHRIE: Hah! You'll see.\nACE: Bet he’s a bundle of fun at parties.\nBEV: TARRANT ON, he’s been here longer than anyone. Actually seems to like it. But then this planet attracts nutters. If it’s not Guthrie then it’s the mob from the Outhouse.\nACE: Outhouse?\nBEV: TARRANT The drop outs. Guthrie says they came up with some arty name originally, but the workers here call it the Outhouse because everything they produce is —\nACE: (Quickly) Oh right, the Doctor’s space hippies. is\nBEV: TARRANT Yeah, they built their own colony out on the dust.” ‘You’ve never seen such a lash up. The Duchamp Corporation tried to evict them, but they’re stubborn and they're getting a lot of support.\nACE: How on earth do they survive out here?\nBEV: TARRANT Oh they’ve got it all worked out. The freighter crews buy bits of work off them and ship things back to the homeworlds and out to the frontier.* Some of the artists are getting quite well known. It’s becoming very fashionable to have some dust art from Duchamp 331. It’s the only place that I'm able to off-load any of my...\nACE: Loot?\nBEV: TARRANT Merchandise! I was going to head out there in a bit and see if I can get enough money for the idol to refuel my ship. Borrowed a dust skimmer from engineering. Interested? THE DOCTOR We'd be delighted!\nACE: Doctor! Where have you been? THE DOCTOR Just seeing if the command crew here could shed any light on the destruction of that refuelling base.\nACE: And? THE DOCTOR Nothing as yet. But the storm is easing and communications are working again.\nACE: Great.\nACE: 153\nACE: THE DOCTOR And the commander would like us to stay around whilst they investigate.\nACE: Not so great.\nACE: THE DOCTOR So I think a little trip to the local artists’ colony is just the thing to pass the time, don’t you?\nACE: 13, INT. THE OUTHOUSE — DAY We hear a radio crackle into life. An alert signal.\nDAMIEN: Yes?\nSALVADORI: (Over) That sounded a bit tetchy, my dear. I’m all for the\nSALVADORI: artistic jemperament, but is that any way to speak to your beloved atron?:\nDAMIEN: Madame Salvadori... Forgive me, 1 was... preoccupied.\nSALVADORI: (Over) I'm so very glad to hear it. And how is my\nSALVADORI: commission progressing?\nSALVADORI: DAMIEN The sketch was a success. I'm hopeful that the full work\nSALVADORI: will be ready for your arrival.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Hopeful? My dear, you have no choice. We are on\nSALVADORI: route and will be with you in exactly three hours. If you are not ready to\nSALVADORI: make me look fabulous in front of my guests then I will be angry...\nDAMIEN: But Madame Salvadori...\nSALVADORI: (Over) Very angry. And I’d hate to withdraw my\nSALVADORI: patronage. Young artists do struggle so.\nSALVADORI: There is a commotion from outside.\nDAMIEN: I must go, madame. We have visitors.\nSALVADORI: Just make sure you’re ready, Damien. Three hours.\nSALVADORI: A skimmer engine powers down.\nBEV: TARRANT Here we are.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Extraordinary!\nACE: I see what you mean about a lash up!\nBEV: TARRANT Built it all themselves. Cannibalised most of the parts from the ship they arrived in.” As more people arrive so the colony gets bigger. I’m amazed the thing stays afloat. Ah, here’s Damien.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Damien?\nBEV: TARRANT Damien Pierson. Sort of leader of this bunch...\nDAMIEN: Miss Tarrant. Back again so soon?\nDAMIEN: a TARRANT Can't keep away, Damien. Brought a couple of art lovers wi me.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Good afternoon, I'm the Doctor, this is Ace.\nACE: Hiya.\nDAMIEN: Welcome to the Outhouse.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Thank you.\nDAMIEN: It’s rare we get visitors, Doctor. Was there something specific that you were interested in?\nACE: Yeah, a painting by... Ow!\nACE: THE DOCTOR No, nothing in particular. Just browsing, really.\nDAMIEN: Then allow me to show you around some of the studios.\nDAMIEN: 154\nDAMIEN: (Walking away) Now then Miss Tarrant, you will no doubt have some more interesting artifacts to show me...\nACE: (Whispering) Professor. That hurt. If you think the painting is here then why don't we just ask muggins where it is, grab it and push off?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Because there is something else going on here, and I want to find out what it is. Mysterious circumstances, remember...\nACE: The sound of the party is distant. We hear the footsteps of a lone security guard,\nGUARD: Check the hold they say. Never check the bar, or check out. the cold buffet, or check to see if the beds are comfortable. Always check the hold. I mean, what do they think I’m going to find? The boxes are checked at customs at the departure lounge. Then security do a sweep before the crates are loaded, then shipboard security do another check before the robots bring the crates down here. But no, every time we start a journey it’s, ‘Albert, go down to the hold and check the crates,’ whilst the nobs enjoy themselves at the champagne reception. And here they are. Crates. Dozens of them, All checked and accounted for, all of them... (There is a crash from one side and a scuffle) Hey, who's there?” (Another scuffle) There’s no point trying to hide, I can see you, so come out.” (Another scuffle)\nGUARD: THE MASTER I apologise. I was just checking that my... cargo was secure.\nGUARD: It’s Mr Seta, isn’t it? Look, sir, this is a restricted area. No guests are allowed in the lower levels. I’m afraid I'm going to have to report you to the captain.\nGUARD: THE MASTER Really. How unfortunate...\nGUARD: Really, sir there’s no need to... what are you doing? No! Keep back! NO! AAAAAAAAAARGH!\nGUARD: There is the high pitched whine of a weapon, and @ scream.\nGUARD: The Doctor and Ace are being shown around.\nDAMIEN: So as you can see, we cover just about every discipline. Fine art, sculpture, textiles. E It’s wicked.\nAC: THE DOCTOR ‘You have some very talented people here Mr Pierson.\nAC: A door opens. Bev steps in.\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Hm?\nBEV: TARRANT I've just had a message from Guthrie. The technician you found — Binks. He’s dead.\nACE: Dead?\nACE: THE DOCTOR That's preposterous. He should have made a full recovery.\nBEV: TARRANT The commander wants us 3 back.\nDAMIEN: Problems, Doctor?\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Yes. Something’s come up as it always does. I'm afraid ]’m going to have to leave.\nDAMIEN: 155\nDAMIEN: I’m sorry to hear that. There’s still a lot to show you.\nACE: Hey, could I stay, Doctor?” THE DOCTOR Are you sure?\nACE: ‘Yeah. I like it here. It’s like Camden market gone mad.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Right. We’ll be back later.\nBEV: TARRANT Have fun. ; THE DOCTOR Oh and Ace... (low) Keep your eyes open for anything...\nACE: . moysterious. Right, Doctor.\nACE: 17, INT. ‘GALLERY’ BALLROOM. 5 The party is in full swing now. Salvadori is mingling with her guests.\nKLEMP: Madame Salvadori.\nSALVADORI: Oh, what is it Klemp?\nKLEMP: If I might have a word...\nSALVADORI: Oh, honestly. If you will excuse me ambassador... You are a gooseberry, Klemp, a total gooseberry.\nKLEMP: There has been an incident in the hold, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: Incident? What the devil do you mean by an incident? KLEMP A murder, madame. One of the guards.\nSALVADORI: Murder? On my ship? How? When?\nKLEMP: I think you should come and see for yourself...\nKLEMP: The medical equipment that once beeped rhythmically now gives out a Jong flat note. A door opens.\nBEV: TARRANT Well?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR The crew here are at a loss. The medical computer indicated that he was fine.\nBEV: TARRANT So what now?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR I’ve persuaded the commander to let me do an autopsy.”\nBEV: TARRANT Man of many talents, aren’t you, Doctor...?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And in the absence of Ace, you’ve just volunteered to be my assistant!\nKLEMP: Here we are, madame.\nSALVADORI: Oh that’s grotesque. Grotesque. I feel quite ill.\nSALVADORI: arian I must admit to never having seen anything like it efore.\nSALVADORI: Cover it up. Cover it up! Who was he?\nKLEMP: (Taps at a keypad) Albert Bootle, ma’am, security guard.\nSALVADORI: Thank heavens it wasn’t one of the guests. What was the man doing down here?\nKLEMP: Checking on the cargo. It seems likely he disturbed an intruder.\nKLEMP: SALVADORI An intruder? In the hold? With all this priceless art. It is all still here, isn’t it? Tell me its all still here, Klemp!\nKLEMP: MP (Taps at a keypad, then) All accounted for ma‘am.\nSALVADORI: 0h thank the stars.\nKLEMP: There is one interesting fact...\nSALVADORI: Stop being needlessly melodramatic, Klemp! Out with it!\nSALVADORI: 156\nKLEMP: It would appear that our intruder was tampering with the eargo of our masked friend —- Mr Seta.\nKLEMP: A door opens.\nKLEMP: DAMIEN And this is our gallery. A modest collection of pieces of historical value.\nACE: My ‘0’ level art teacher would have loved this.”\nDAMIEN: I'm sorry?\nACE: She used to love all this abstract stuff.** Used to be able\nACE: to waffle on for hours about the importance of form and meaning and stuff...\nDAMIEN: Yes... quite. Well, if you will excuse me, Ace, I have Matters to attend to. When you’re finished here, ask anyone and they'll direct you back A my office.\nACE: kay. Cheers. The door closes. Ace walks around the room.\nACE: All a load of Jackson Pollocks if you ask me. Hey! The girl\nACE: from Perivale hits the jackpot again. The Scream, by Edvard Munch. Yuck! Can’t see what you want it for, though Professor. Hardly the cheeriest painting.\nACE: Gradually a noise begins to build — a low throbbing. This should be one of those classic and very recognisable Doctor Who type sound effects — something like Fendahi. It get louder.\nACE: Yes. I can hear (gives a ery of pain) ...ah... Professor... (The noise builds and builds) Doctor... help..\nACE: Wind thrashes against the window\nBEV: TARRANT [ think it’s going to be a while before we can pick Ace up. This storm is really building again\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Well we’re going to be here for a little while anyway. I’m going to make the first incision here...\nBEV: TARRANT Is this a good point to tell you that I'm a tad squeamish...? I think that I... Oh my God! Doctor. There's no blood.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR No...\nBEV: TARRANT That looks like...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Dust. This man’s body is full of dust. Where’s that microscope? (There is a beep of machinery) Fascinating.\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor...”\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Look at this, Beverly. The dust particles are moving of their own volition.\nBEV: TARRANT So is our corpse...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR What?\nBEV: Bev screams. Medical equipment crashes aside.\nTECHNICIAN: Ashes to ashes!\nTECHNICIAN: THE DOCTOR Bev! Get away from the window!\nTECHNICIAN: There is the shattering of glass. Wind howls in.\nTECHNICIAN: Dust to dust!\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor!\nBEV: The howling wind mingles with the end title theme.\nBEV: 157"

Well, if you will excuse me, Ace, I have matters to attend to. When you're finished here, ask anyone and they'll direct you back to my office.\nACE: Okay. Cheers.\nACE: The door closes. Ace walks around the room.\nACE: All a load of Jackson Pollocks if you ask me. Hey! The girl from Perivale hits the jackpot again. The Scream, by Edvard Munch. Yuck! Can't see what you want it for, though Professor. Hardly the cheeriest painting.\nACE: Gradually a noise begins to build —- a low throbbing. This should be one of those classic and very recognisable Doctor Who type sound effects - something like Fendahl. It get louder.\nACE: Yes. I can hear (gives a ery of pain) ...Ah... Professor... (The noise builds and builds) Doctor... help...\nACE: Wind thrashes against the window\nBEV: TARRANT [ think it’s going to be a while before we can pick Ace up. This storm is really building again\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Well we're going to be here for a little while anyway. ’'m going to make the first incision here...\nBEV: TARRANT Is this a good point to tell you that I'm a tad squeamish...? I think that I... Oh my God! Doctor. There’s no blood.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR No...\nBEV: TARRANT That looks like...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Dust. This man’s body is full of dust. Where’s that microscope?

The dust particles are moving of their own. volition.\nBEV: TARRANT So is our corpse...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR What?\nBEV: Bev screams. Medical equipment crashes aside.\nTECHNICIAN: Ashes to ashes!\nTECHNICIAN: THE DOCTOR Bev! Get away from the window!\nTECHNICIAN: There is the shattering of glass. Wind howls in.\nTECHNICIAN: Dust to dust!\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor!\nBEV: 158\nBEV: The howling wind mixes to:\nBEV: The noise from the scream is deafening now. Ace hammers on the door.\nACE: Please, stop... Doctor... the painting... The scream... make it stop...\nACE: 2S.INT. REFUELLING BASE A. SICKBAY Howling wind and smashing glass. The Doctor and Bev have to shout above the noise.\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor!\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Get back! Get away from the windows!\nBEV: Another window smashes.\nBEV: TARRANT What is Binks doing?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Letting in more of the dust. Get that door open!\nBEV: Bev punches at the door controls.\nBEV: TARRANT It’s no good! They’re jammed! The controls are full of dust, (She coughs) We're going to suffocate!\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Quick, give me a hand here!\nBEV: TARRANT (Coughing) What the hell are you doing?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR The air conditioning unit. Help me get the cover off!\nBEV: TARRANT I rather think we’ve got enough air in here already. THE DOCTOR If I can just boost the power and reverse the polarity... There is a powerful whine as the air conditioning starts up. The technician gives a long drawn out scream and then everything goes quiet. THE DOCTOR .. then all the dust will be vented outside.\nBEV: The door opens.\nGUTHRIE: What in tarnation’s been going in in here?*°\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Ah, Mr Guthrie. I don't suppose you've got a broom?\nGUTHRIE: The throbbing noise from the painting abruptly stops and the door opens.\nACE: (Gasping with pain) Ooh... Hope that was mysterious enough for you, Professor.\nACE: 27, INT. ‘GALLERY’ SALVADORI’S CABIN.\nSALVADORI: How many people know about this murder, Klemp?\nKLEMP: Outside of this room, only the head of security and a handful of guards, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: Their silence can be bought quite easily. I want no word to the guests, do you understand? This must be kept a secret. Have the... remains locked in my safe,\nSALVADORI: KLEMP At once, ma'am. (He crosses the room and opens the door and is startled) Oh, Mr Seta. You startled me.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER I hope I’m not intruding?\nSALVADORI: No, not at all, not at all, Please, won't you come inside. Thank you, Klemp if you will... attend to those matters for me.\nSALVADORI: 159\nKLEMP: Yes, ma’am.\nKLEMP: The door closes.\nSALVADORI: Now, Mr Seta. What can I do for you? Can I offer you a drink?\nSALVADORI: \"HE MASTER Thank you, no. I just came to ensure that everything is still running according to schedule.\nSALVADORI: (Nervous) Why yes. Everything is just fine.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER [I am glad to hear it.\nSALVADORI: Why do you ask?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER I have invested a great deal in this little venture of yours, madame.\nSALVADORI: Indeed, and we are very grateful...\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER (Interrupting) And I have a vested interest in ensuring that everything runs to a very strict timetable. I am something of a perfectionist when it comes to time.\nSALVADORI: (Starting to bristle) ] assure you, Mr Seta, that everything is exactly as it should be. Our arrival at Duchamp 331 will be exactly on schedule and the little... entertainment that I have planned is well in hand.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Then I shall not take up any more of your valuable time. (He gets up to leave. The door opens) This mask I wear can be misleading. People take it to mean that I am disabled in some way, infirm, perhaps. I assure you, I am anything but. Good evening madame.\nSALVADORI: The door swishes shut.\nSALVADORI: SALVADORI And you, Mr Seta, will discover that Iam a woman who does not take kindly to being threatened.*”\nGUTHRIE: deez! What a mess!\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Fascinating.\nBEV: TARRANT Our corpse doesn’t seem to be the man he once was. THE DOCTOR No. Ali the fluid in his body had been replaced with dust. When we vented everything outside...**\nBEV: TARRANT That's horrible.\nGUTHRIE: Heh! Not much left of him now. Looks just like an old empty water bag.\nBEV: TARRANT [ need a cigarette. Give me your lighter, Guthrie.”\nBEV: The klunk of the zippo.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Dangerous habit on a refuelling station.\nBEV: TARRANT It has been mentioned. Thanks, Guthrie. (Pause) Doctor, what in God's name is going on here?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR I don't know, not yet.\nGUTHRIE: But it’s left to me to clean up, as usual.\nGUTHRIE: A hoover starts up.\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR (He coughs) Come on Bev, let’s get out of Mr Guthrie's\nGUTHRIE: way. The door swishes open.\nGUTHRIE: Ace wanders through echoey corridors. The wind sound from outside.\nACE: Hello? Anybody about? (Silence) Brilliant. Anybody will\nACE: 160\nACE: direct you to my office, he says, but when you've been attacked by a psycho painting and need help can you find anyone? No. (Pause) Where the hell has everybody gone?\nACE: A door opens and the Doctor and Bev enter.\nBEV: TARRANT How come whenever I cross paths with you something is trying to kill me?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR There's something not right here. Binks was meant to kill us, sure enough, but there were far more direct means he could have used.\nBEV: TARRANT Suffocation seems fairly direct to me.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And all that shouting. It all seemed so...\nBEV: TARRANT Theatrical?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes. Like he was putting on a performance\nBEV: TARRANT Most performances don't kill off the audience.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR You're assuming that we were the audience...\nBEV: TARRANT Then who?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR I don’t know, Bev. Not yet...\nBEV: TARRANT Do you... Do you think that the dust is alive in some way?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR No. No, I don’t think so. If that was true I think we'd all be dead by now. No J think the dust is being manipulated somehow. Driven by some outside force.\nBEV: We hear the Doctor and Bev talking, overheard on some surveillance device.\nBEV: TARRANT (Over) You think someone is controlling it? How?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Over) Telekinesis of some kind perhaps. At the moment I’m more interested in why than how.\nBEV: TARRANT (Over) And this is connected with the destruction of the other base.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Over) It would be very surprising if it wasn't, don’t you think?\nBEV: NB: The following dialogue is for the background of the scene below — behind Ace and Damien’s dialogue.\nBEV: TARRANT (Over) I don’t know, Doctor. It seems a bit... far fetched to me.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Over) You have some better idea?\nBEV: TARRANT (Over) But telekinetic dust?!\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Over) Is it any more far fetched than living raindrops?\nBEV: TARRANT (Over) No you've got a point there. God, why is life always so complicated with you?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Over) It’s a knack. (He sighs) And to think I just wanted to collect a painting.\nDAMIEN: (To himself, this line running over the Doctor’s: it would be very surprising if it wasn’t, don’t you think?) You are too clever by half, Doctor. Clever and dangerous.\nDAMIEN: A door slams open and a very pissed off Ace enters.\nDAMIEN: 161\nACE: There you are. I’ve been all over this lash-up looking for you! What sort of freaky outfit are you running here, Damien? One of your paintings just decided to do some very strange things to my head, and... Hey! That’s the Doctor and Bev! What the hell are you playing at?\nDAMIEN: Ah, my dear Ace. It seems your friend the Doctor isn’t quite the art lover that I hoped he would be.\nACE: If you’ve hurt him...\nDAMIEN: Oh, don’t be stupid girl. I'm not going to hurt him, not yet.\nDAMIEN: The final work would be sadly diminished if we wasted all our materials on the sketches.\nACE: Sketches?\nDAMIEN: All great works begin with sketches, but they are just pale echoes of what is still to come.\nDAMIEN: ACE And what's that then, Damien? What have we got to look\nDAMIEN: forward to? More hallucinogenic paintings?\nDAMIEN: My sculpture! My masterpiece! The piece that will assure my place alongside the greatest artists in history. You should feel privileged.\nACE: Privileged, right.\nACE: DAMIEN To be a part of a work of art. To be talked about throughout the galaxy for the rest of time. You will be immortal.\nACE: Right, Damien. Now I know you're mad. I’m going to get the Doctor.\nDAMIEN: Ah, ah, ah. I] think I'd rather have you somewhere where I can keep an eye on you.\nDAMIEN: ACE And how exactly are you going to stop me?\nDAMIEN: DAMIEN With this.\nACE: Ah...\nDAMIEN: These aren't a very aesthetic solution to life’s problems\nDAMIEN: I will admit, but they are very good at shutting the chattering mouths of critics.\" (A gun fires)\nBEV: TARRANT But, Doctor, if you're right then the destruction of refuelling site B wasn’t a natural disaster at all. It was planned — deliberate.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes.\nBEV: TARRANT But that would mean that someone is capable of manipulating the dust in vast quantities.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes. Unnerving isn’t it? To know that there is nowhere you could escape to. No dry land for sanctuary.\nBEV: TARRANT But why? Why would anyone do this?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR I'm not sure. Not yet. How many of these refuelling bases are there?\nBEV: TARRANT Six. At least there were six...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And how many crew?*!\nBEV: TARRANT I'm not sure, twenty, maybe twenty five on each base. THE DOCTOR (Thoughtfully) No more than a hundred or so people on the entire planet...\nBEV: TARRANT There are a few freighter crews, but they hardly ever spend any time down here. Even the thought of shipboard rations is considered a better option than spending a night on Duchamp. Oh, and\nBEV: 162\nBEV: there's the Outhouse of course. Must be almost fifty of them over there. THE DOCTOR Really? But we barely saw more than half a dozen artists.\nBEV: TARRANT Maybe they don’t like company. Artists are meant to be reclusive aren't they?\nBEV: A door opens and Guthrie shambles in, coughing.\nGUTHRIE: You youngsters sure know how to make a mess.” Sickbay’s damn near useless now, dust in everything...\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Yes. I’m afraid I do tend to stir things up a bit. It’s a gift.\nGUTHRIE: Things will be stirred up a damn sight more before this is over, an’ all.*\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Really? Why do you say that?\nGUTHRIE: Cos I knows, that’s all.”\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR You've seen this before, haven’t you, Mr Guthrie? The dust, the storms?\nGUTHRIE: Might have.”\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR When?\nGUTHRIE: (Suspicious) Why's you want to know?”\nBEV: TARRANT Oh, take no notice of him, Doctor. It’s just another of his stories.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Quiet, Bev!\nGUTHRIE: Believe what you like girl. Guthrie knows, knows what\nGUTHRIE: happens when the planet gets angry.\nBEV: TARRANT Oh, come on...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Sharply) Beverly! (Quietly) What do you know, Mr Guthrie? Tell me.\nGUTHRIE: (His voice dropping low) There weren’t many of us who first came to Duchamp. A handful of us, barely away from our mothers’ arms. Conscripted by the Duchamp Corporation to build a new world. It was no easy colonisation. The damn planet fought us every step of the way, the wind and the dust. It got everywhere. In machinery we thought sealed. In throats and eyes and noses. Wind and dust...\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR But there was more, wasn't there, something else that you saw.\nGUTHRIE: Frontier life is hard on a man, Doc.‘” No one is ever there to look out for you, to watch your back, but here on Duchamp the planet made us bind together, gave us something to rage against, something real to fight.\" My partner and I were out on a skimmer trawling for dust sharks. The wind started to build, and then...\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Yes...\nGUTHRIE: GUTHRIE The dust rose up, became a living thing... a huge fist. It took my partner, dragged him down. I tried to save him. Tried to claw him back. All I ever found was this.\nBEV: TARRANT Your lighter.\nGUTHRIE: His lighter. I don't know why the planet left me, never have known, but I’m damned if I’m going to leave until I know why.”\nBEV: TARRANT No one believed you?\nGUTHRIE: Work crew always have blood feuds. Company just shrugged it off.’ No one’s goin’ to mourn the death of another labourer. THE DOCTOR They blamed you?\nGUTHRIE: No, but I blamed me. Said I’d look after him. I can still hear the scream sometimes. Echoin’ down in the wind.\nBEV: TARRANT You're a cheery soul, Guthrie.\nBEV: 163\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And there was no one else around. Nothing else on the\nBEV: lanet\nGUTHRIE: Nope. Just us, and the luvvies over at the Outhouse. THE DOCTOR The Outhouse was here, back then?\nGUTHRIE: Just Damien and a few. The first of many.\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Really...\nBEV: TARRANT What are you thinking, Doctor?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR That we should go and get Ace. I’m beginning to suspect that our answers lie out in the dust.\nBEV: TARRANT Oh, not with Guthrie’s legendary crashed Daleks?\nBEV: THE DOGTOR No. No, with something far more real and tangible.*' With Mr Damien Pierson.\nBEV: The usual chatter of guests, music, and chink of wine glasses. Salvadori is playing the part of the perfect host.\nSALVADORI: No ambassador, you are going to have to be patient. It would hardly be a surprise if I let you know what little treat I have in store for you, now would it? Ah. If you would excuse me, I think there are some matters that I need to attend to. (She crosses the ballroom) Klemp, the body is safely tucked away, I trust?*?\nKLEMP: Far from prying eyes madame.\nSALVADORI: Good. Then I have another little errand for you.\nKLEMP: Ma‘am?\nSALVADORI: Our Mr Seta is becoming a little tno... arrogant for his own good. He has upset me, Klemp, and you know how I dislike being\nKLEMP: Yes, madame.\nSALVADORI: He actually had the audacity to threaten me on my own\nKLEMP: You wish him disposed of?\nSALVADORI: Oh, no. I don’t think that we need to go quite that far, not just yet. Whatever my personal feelings for the man, his wealth is very attractive. Have you really been able to find out nothing about him, no hints at all as to his past?\nKLEMP: (Taps at a keypad) I'm afraid not, madame. You know how efficient our sources are, but even they have been unable to unearth more than the odd whispered rumour about the man.\nSALVADORI: Then the answers may lie in this mysterious cargo of his, Klemp. I want you to find out what it is. A man who can spend so much on jewellery and masks...\nKLEMP: Might have a great deal more.\nSALVADORI: Exactly. Go down to the hold, my dear. Find out what is in those crates. Find out who this man is.\nSALVADORI: KLEMP At once, madame.\nSALVADORI: Oh, and Klemp.\nKLEMP: Yes, ma’am?\nSALVADORI: Take a gun, just in case our murderer is still down there.\nSALVADORI: ake ont want your body joining the one I already have in my safe, now lo we?\nKLEMP: (With a nervous jaugh) No ma’am.\nKLEMP: 164\nKLEMP: He walks away.\nSALVADORI: Now, Mr Seta, we will see just how much use you are to mne, and if you have been leading me on then our chef can have such fun devising new fillings for the vol-au-vents.\nSALVADORI: There is a groan as Ace comes around.\nDAMIEN: Ah. At last. I was beginning to think you'd never come round. It’s so difficult to be accurate with these stun gun controls.\nACE: (Groaning) Where am I?\nDAMIEN: I'm assuming that you mean literally, as opposed to metaphysically.\nACE: Right bundles of laughs aren’t you..\nDAMIEN: You’re in the gallery.**\nACE: Oh no..\nDAMIEN: No? Tve always liked it here myself. Calm, quiet, away from prying eyes.\nACE: We've got to get out of here.\nDAMIEN: After all the trouble I've gone to carrying you back down here. I don’t think so.\nACE: But you don’t understand! There’s something in here.\nACE: Something in the painting. Something that screams...\nACE: DAMIEN The painting is joining its voice to the sounds of the planet\nACE: You know, don’t you? You know what it is!\nDAMIEN: Yes. it is something... wonderful. Something...\nDAMIEN: inspirational.\nACE: It’s evil Damien!\nDAMIEN: No. It is mine! It is power! It is inspiring me.\nACE: It’s using you! It’s not interested in your art or your\nACE: colony. You’ve got to let me get the Doctor. You've got to let us help you.\nDAMIEN: (Vicious) Help me? You’re kind never help, never see. You\nDAMIEN: laugh and mock, you look down your nose at the art we create here, but when I have finished...\nACE: (Frightened) All right. I believe you.”\nDAMIEN: (Suddenly calm again) I’m being unfair. You can’t possibly know. Not until you have been touched. Not until you have achieved full communion. There have been plenty who were unsure when they joined us here, but after communion... You will soon understand.\nACE: Where are you going?\nDAMIEN: I have things to prepare. An audience that mustn’t be kept waiting.\nACE: No, don’t leave me here!\nDAMIEN: Goodbye Ace.\nACE: You can’t leave me in here with that thing! You can’t let\nACE: it... (The door shuts) Damien! (She hammers on the door) Damn you, Damien let me out of here! (Slowly the throbbing noise from the painting starts to build again) DAMIEN!\nACE: The wind lashes against the window.\nACE: 165\nGUTHRIE: Goin’ to be a bad one. Seen a lot of damage done by storms like this.\nBEV: TARRANT You're never going to get over to the Outhouse by skimmer.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR 1 wasn’t intending to try. I thought I’d go by TARDIS.\nBEV: TARRANT Your ship?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes. And before you ask, no you can’t come with me.\nBEV: TARRANT But Ace...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Can look after herself. Mostly... Besides, I think that things are going to get a good deal worse, and I need someone back here that I can trust. i\"\nGUTHRIE: You can rely on us, Doc...\nGUTHRIE: THE DOCTOR Thank you, Mr Guthrie. Bev?\nBEV: TARRANT Okay, Doctor. Whatever you say.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Good. Won’t be long. I hope.\nBEV: The Doctor opens the TARDIS door, shuts it, and the ship dematerialises.\nBEV: TARRANT Hope you know what you’re stepping into Doctor.\nBEV: Wind rattles the base.\nGUTHRIE: This one’s going to be a humdinger!”\nGUTHRIE: The throb of the painting is joined by the noise of the TARDIS materialising. The door opens.\nACE: Doctor? Oh, Doctor thank God! 2 THE DOCTOR (Concerned) Ace? What's the matter Ace, what's wrong?”\nACE: He left me in here. Left me alone with that thing.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Thing?\nACE: There, The painting.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Ah... The Scream, by Edvard Munch...\nACE: Don’t go near it, Doctor. There’s something alive in there.\nACE: Something evil.\nACE: THE DOCTOR It's all right, Ace. It’s all right. I’m beginning to understand.\nACE: The throbbing from the picture is subdued, now, quieter.\nACE: Damien thinks that it’s just some kind of inspiration.\nACE: I think he's using it like some kind of drug, but it’s controlling him, Doctor.\nACE: 1 know it is. I could hear it in my mind, screaming and screaming...\nACE: THE DOCTOR It’s all right, Ace.\nACE: (Calmer) It's freaked me a bit, Doctor. Damien said that\nACE: if he left me here then I would achieve communion with it.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Did he now...\nACE: I don’t think I’m the first person he’s left in here with it.\nACE: cue pocToR. According to Mr Guthrie there should be fifty or so people Te.\nACE: Oh no. What's he done to them?\nACE: THE DOCTOR $ I’m not sure. Not yet.\nACE: He’s mad, Doctor, barking mad.\nACE: THEDOCTOR Mad? Or easily led? Let’s see shall we?\nACE: Careful, Doctor. Whatever it is in there, it’s not pleasant.\nACE: THE DOCTOR How do you do? I’m the Doctor. (The painting gives an\nACE: angry crackle) You’ve been alone for a long time, haven't you? Trapped\nACE: in the painting. Influencing the world around you without ever being able\nACE: 166\nACE: to interact with it. (Another crackle) How long have you been influencing Damien I wonder, how long since you started expressing yourself through The throbbing starts to build again.\nACE: Agh. Doctor. That sound...\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Quietly but forcefully) Go back Acel® (The throbbing increases) There’s no need for this. I want to help you. Let me help!\nACE: The throbbing reaches a crescendo.\nACE: Doctor!!\nACE: The sound of booted feet.\nKLEMP: Right. You men open that crate. (There is the beep of a communicator) Klemp.\nSALVADORI: (Over) How are you doing Klemp? We're approaching orbit.\nKLEMP: Just opening the first crate now, ma'am. (Irritated) Hurry it up there! (There is the splintering of wood) Good lord...\nSALVADORI: (Over) What? What have you found?\nKLEMP: One moment, ma’am. Open the others.\nKLEMP: There is more splintering as the other crates are prised open.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Well, Klemp. Don’t keep me in suspense. What is in those crates? _KLEMP Eggs, Madame Salvadori.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Eggs?\nKLEMP: Yes, ma’am. Eggs. Four of them.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Are you telling me that Mr Seta is nothing more than an egg collector? Are they gold? Fabergé?\nKLEMP: No, ma’am. Larger than that. Considerably. (There is a chuckle from the gloom). Who’s there? Come out. I have a gun.\nSALVADORI: (Over) What is it Klemp? What’s going on?\nKLEMP: I'll get back to you later, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Klemp I order you to...\nSALVADORI: The communicator is shut off with a beep.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Weil done Mr Klemp. She really does have the most irritating voice.\nKLEMP: I must respectfully ask you to be civil when talking about my employer, Mr Seta.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Respectfully ask? Respectfully? After you and your armed thugs come down here and break into my cargo?\nKLEMP: We are conducting a... safety check. We had some trouble down here earlier.\nKLEMP: ‘THE MASTER Yes, I know. You seem to be very interested in my business, Mr Klemp. Curiosity can be a very dangerous pastime. Particularly if you are not in full possession of the facts.\nLEMP: Mr Seta. I must ask you to stay back. My men and I are armed.\nLEMP: THE MASTER (ignoring him) These eggs for example. Fascinating aren’t they? And I’m sure you must be interested to know what kind of creature might emerge, should one of these eggs happen to hatch.\nKLEMP: Please, Mr Seta...\nKLEMP: 167\nKLEMP: THE MASTER They are designed to withstand almost anything, impervious to attack. They have waited patiently in the cold of space, waited for the conditions to be just right, or for a signal from this device to be reborn.\nKLEMP: Mr Seta, I must ask you to stand back.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER (Chuckling) Witness the birth of one of the ultimate weapons.\nKLEMP: There is a shrill signal. The eggs start to crack. Horrible shrieks fill the air. The guards start to fire. The creatures roar. The men scream.\nKLEMP: My God, what are they?\nKLEMP: THE MASTER The Krill are an ancient and devastating weapon, Mr Klemp. And the means by which I shall become all powerful.\nKLEMP: Who... who are you?\nKLEMP: THE MASTER I am the Master. And you will obey me!\nKLEMP: The roar of the Krill blends with the end titles.\nKLEMP: 168"

(The painting gives an angry crackle) You've been alone for a long time, haven’t you? Trapped in the painting. Influencing the world around you without ever being able to interact with it. (Another crackle) How long have you been influencing Damien I wonder, how long since you started expressing yourself through him?\nACE: The throbbing starts to build again.\nACE: Agh. Doctor. That sound...\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Quietly but forcefully) Go back Ace! (The throbbing increases.) There’s no need for this. I want to help you. Let me help! The throbbing reaches a crescendo.\nACE: Doctor}!\nACE: The sound of booted feet.\nKLEMP: Right. You men open that crate. (There is the beep of a\nKLEMP: communicator) Klemp.\nSALVADORI: (Over) How are you doing Klemp? We’re approaching orbit. Just opening the first crate now, ma’am. (Irritated) Hurry\nSALVADORI: it up there! (There is the splintering of wood.) Good lord...\nSALVADORI: (Over) What? What have you found?\nKLEMP: One moment, ma’am. Open the others.\nKLEMP: There is more splintering as the other crates are prised open.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Well, Klemp. Don’t keep me in suspense. What is\nSALVADORI: in those crates?\nLEMP: Eggs, Madame Salvadori.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Eggs?\nKLEMP: Yes, ma'am. Eggs. Four of them.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Are you telling me that Mr Seta is nothing more\nSALVADORI: than an egg collector? Are they Gold? Faberge?\nKLEMP: No, ma’am. Larger than that. Considerably. (There is a\nKLEMP: chuckle from the gloom). Who's there? Come out. I have a gun.\nSALVADORI: (Over) What is it Klemp? What's going on?\nKLEMP: I'll get back to you later, ma’am.\nSALVADORI: (Over) Klemp I order you to...\nSALVADORI: The communicator is shut off with a beep.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Well done Mr Klemp. She really does have the most\nSALVADORI: irritating voice.\nKLEMP: I must respectfully ask you to be civil when talking about\nKLEMP: my employer, Mr Seta.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Respectfully ask? Respectfully? After you and your\nKLEMP: armed thugs come down here and break into my cargo?\nKLEMP: We are conducting a... safety check. We had some trouble\nKLEMP: down here earlier.\nKLEMP: 169\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Yes, I know. You seem to be very interested in my business, Mr Klemp. Curiosity can be a very dangerous pastime. Particularly if you are not in full possession of the facts.\nKLEMP: Mr Seta. I must ask you to stay back. My men and I are armed.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER (Ignoring him) These eggs for example. Fascinating aren’t they? And I'm sure you must be interested to know what kind of creature might emerge, should one of these eggs happen to hatch.\nKLEMP: Please, Mr Seta...\nKLEMP: ‘THE MASTER They are designed to withstand almost anything, impervious to attack. They have waited patiently in the cold of space, waited for the conditions to be just right, or for a signal from this device to be reborn.\nKLEMP: Mr Seta, I must ask you to stand back. THE MASTER (Chuckling)Witness the birth of one of the ultimate weapons.\nKLEMP: There is a shrill signal. The eggs start to crack. Horrible shrieks fill the air. The guards start to fire. The creatures roar. The men scream.\nKLEMP: My God, what are they?\nKLEMP: THE MASTER The Krill are an ancient and devastating weapon, Mr Klemp. And the means by which I shall become all powerful.\nKLEMP: Who... who are you?\nKLEMP: THE MASTER I am the Master. And you will obey me!\nKLEMP: The roar of the Krill reaches a terrifying crescendo...\nGUTHRIE: Well now here’s a thing. Control tower's picked up a ship heading this way. A big one.\nBEV: TARRANT Hardly surprising Guthrie. This is a refuelling base. People come here to refuel.\nGUTHRIE: This ain’t one of ours.°' Nothin’ scheduled to stop here. Know those shippin’ schedules backwards I do, and there’s nothin’ due near us for weeks.”\nBEV: TARRANT What is it then?\nGUTHRIE: Fancy lookin’ boat from her sensor profiles. She ain’t answering our hails, though.*\nBEV: TARRANT Great. That’s all we need. Dust storms, walking corpses, and now mysterious spaceships.\nGUTHRIE: Told you, girl. This mess ain’t over yet!™\nGUTHRIE: The painting's throbbing is unbearable now. Ace screams above the noise.\nACE: Doctor! (Abruptly the sound stops. So Ace speaks quieter now) Professor? (The Doctor giggles. Very sinister) Doctor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Distorted and alien) Not quite.\nACE: What have you done with him? Where’s the Doctor? THE DOCTOR Oh he’s here. Backed into a corner of his mind. Fighting to gain some control. Oh, he’s strong, the strongest I’ve met. It’s quite a struggle keeping him subdued.\nACE: 170\nACE: What are you? THE DOCTOR Good. Very good. Questions... Some would have run screaming. But not you. He’s pleased with you, this Doctor of yours.\nACE: I don’t run from anything. THE DOCTOR I frighten you, don’t I?\nACE: Yes. THE DOCTOR It’s what I was built for.\nACE: What are you? THEDOCTOR I am every death you can possibly imagine. I am blood and tongues of fire. 1 am the scream of the madman. They named me the Warp Core, the engineers who created me. I was their child and their protector.\nACE: You're alien? THE DOCTOR More alien than anything you have ever encountered. Oh, this Doctor is tickling at my mind, trying to get the answers he seeks, trying to urge you to ask the right questions, but there really is no need. I will tell you what you want.\nACE: Right, then tell me how you ended up trapped in a painting. THE DOCTOR So long ago... so long. Their ships had sailed across space and time and had seeded many worlds, they were clever people, my creators. But war came to them. Brutal and bloody. They came across a weapon, unstoppable, indiscriminate, and so they created me. Something worse.\nACE: Did it work? Did they win? THE DOCTOR Oh, yes, for a while, but having unleashed me... (He laughs) The genie never wants to get back into the bottle.\nACE: You ran. THE DOCTOR (Vicious) I escaped! I took my freedom and fled. But the universe is so vast, so lonely, so very lonely. I searched for others like myself, searched countless worlds, but... nothing — there is nothing else like me. I found the blue world, innocent and unsuilied. The creatures there fascinated me. 1 was weary so I decided to hide in one of them. Hide and rest.\nACE: You mean Earth don’t you? You hid on Earth. THE DOCTOR I was tired and hurt! The mind of the primitive snapped when I contacted him. His madness tainted me, corrupted me, exorcised me into the painting and there I have waited... sleeping, but now they are hear. I can feel them... Getting closer...\nACE: Who? What's getting closer? THE DOCTOR Your little Doctor is struggling now, fighting to regain control of his pitiful shell, and I cannot waste my strength resisting him There is a storm coming, little one. If you've not run before, then perhaps it is time to learn.\nACE: Wait! What about the Doctor? THE DOCTOR (Weakly in his normal voice) Ace?\nACE: Professor, what happened to you?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Strong... so unimaginably strong... Thought I could control it...\nACE: Where did that thing go?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Back... back into the painting.\nACE: Hey, where are you going?\nACE: 171\nACE: THE DOCTOR We've got to find Damien.\nACE: Why? ; ; ; THE DOCTOR Because if I can’t talk sense into him then everything on this planet is going to be destroyed!\nACE: The buzz of conversation and a band playing classical music fades as Salvadori tings a wine glass.\nSALVADORI: Ladies and Gentlemen. Our mystery cruise is almost at an end. We are currently entering orbit around the planet Duchamp 331. If you would care to start making your way to the observation galleries then I think you'll find that there is quite a treat in store for you. (There is a bustle of people heading for the lifts. She then mutters to herself) Come along Klemp. You're going to miss the show...\nLIFT: VOICE Lift to upper floor now arriving. Please stand clear of the doors.” The doors slide open. And the crowd starts to scream as the Krill emerge roaring and hissing.\nSALVADORI: Oh my God! Klemp! Klemp! (She runs. The screams and roars fade behind her. She is breathless as she runs) Computer... access cabin. Access cabin!\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Authorisation code.\nSALVADORI: It’s me you stupid machine! Let me in!\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Voice print accepted. The door slides open. Salvador! collapses sobbing. There is a slow clap. THE MASTER Bravo, Madame Salvadori. Bravo. I had no idea that your instinct for self preservation was so finely honed.\nSALVADORI: = You! Klemp. What is he doing in here? Answer me Klemp! THE MASTER I'm afraid that Mr Klemp is taking orders from another Master now.\nSALVADORI: Don’t be ridiculous! Klemp has been with me for years. He wouldn't dare disobey me! Answer me Klemp, what is going on?\nSALVADORI: Tso 1\nSALVADORI: Out with it man. Has the cat got your tongue?” Le\nSALVADORI: KLEMP!\nKLEMP: I'm sorry, ma’am. I couldn’t resist him. Those creatures... THE MASTER I'm impressed, Madame Salvadori. It is rare that I meet someone whose will is equal to my own. Unfortunately it does leave Mr Klemp rather surplus to requirements. I do so hate staff who are unreliable. Perhaps I should just dispose of him. Another shrunken corpse in your safe.\nKLEMP: No, please...\nKLEMP: THE MASTER (Laughing) Pathetic. A pathetic dog cowering at your mistress’s side.\nSALVADORI: = You monster.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Yes. But you are used to them, surely.\nSALVADORI: (Hissing) What do you mean?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Oh, they may disguise themselves with airs and graces, but the guests in your ballroom — I'm sorry, the ex-guests in your ballroom - were hardly innocents.\nSALVADORI: 172\nSALVADORI: They were civilised people.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Civilised! You barely know the meaning of the word. They were nothing. Base, cheap peddlers in human misery and suffering.\nSALVADORI: How dare you...\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER That ambassador that you were so fond of. Do you know his secret? Did you even begin to guess at the deaths on his conscience? No. You were dazzled by his wealth. Seduced by the titles of his office. The guests that you gathered here were crooks and cheats, liars and tmourderers, but wealth was their shield, their mask, and we all know how easily you are taken in by masks, madame.\nSALVADORI: Keep away from me.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Did you even bother to ask who I might be, where I came from? No. I blinded with you with the legends of my fortune. Beguiled you with wealth and the promise of power. You have spent your life looking at masks, Madame Salvadori, without the merest thought at what might lie underneath. See what lies beneath my mask...\nSALVADORI: SALVADOR] = (Horrified) Oh my God...\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER (No more mask from here on) Unpleasant, is it not? Would you let me into your circle if you had known? Would you have wooed me if you had the slightest inkling of what you were letting close?” SALVADORI_ (Disgusted) No..\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER You are pathetic. You crave power and dominion, but you do not have the stomach for what it takes to achieve it. You sanitise your unpleasantness, wrap it up in baubles and trinkets and call it the trappings of civilisation, but in the end, madame, we aspire to the same dreams.\nSALVADORI: There are screams and roars from outside.\nKLEMP: Those Krill creatures, madame. He’s unleashed them on the passengers and crew.\nSALVADORI: For what? To steal my fortune. You are nothing more than @ petty thief!\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER (Laughing) You think I planned all this just to steal the wealth of a few moneyed families. How little you must think of me. SALVADORI- Then why...? What is all this for?\nACE: Doctor! Slow down. THE DOCTOR There’s no time Ace!\nACE: Just tell me what’s going on!\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Hxasperated) The entity trapped back there in the painting is the Warp Core. A living weapon. The last line of defence east an aggressor who had built the perfect killing machines.\nACE: But it won, it told me. Tan DOCTOR Yes it won. But in stopping one horror another had been created.“ A being of pure energy, unleashed upon the universe. A creature of instinct and unimaginable power, unfettered by morality or conscience.\nACE: So it ran. THE DOCTOR It destroyed its creators and fled into time and space. ACE To Earth. THE DOCTOR Yes. In the late nineteenth century. It was weak from its\nACE: 173\nACE: battle. It invaded the mind of an artist, tormenting him until he banished it by sheer force of will. Exorcised it into a painting.\nACE: ACE The Scream?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes. The Scream. And there it has lain, dormant, hidden, influencing those around it, listening to the universe for a sign, waiting for its ancient enemies to reappear.\nACE: ACE And they have?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes. When it was in my mind I could feel its hate, its anger. I could feel its power building, the sense of anticipation...\nACE: You mean it’s looking forward to fighting again?\nACE: THE DOCTOR It’s all it knows, Ace. It is all it was built to do. And now somehow it has become reactivated, regenerated. Waiting for its enemy to arrive.\nACE: But what is this enemy? What was it built to fight?\nACE: THE DOCTOR The Krill...\nACE: (Very scared now) Oh no...\nACE: 44, INT. ‘GALLERY’ SALVADORI’S OFFICE.\nSALVADORI: What are the Krill?\nKLEMP: (To himself, quietly) Savage horrible things. Monsters. THE MASTER They are an ancient and devastating biological weapon created by a long dead race, well practised in the arts of war. But they met their match. On the planet below is a creature that makes the Krill look like children’s pets.\nSALVADORI: What are you going to do?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER I'm going to let it loose.\nSALVADORI: 45, INT. REFUELLING BASE A.\nBEV: TARRANT Guthrie. Look at this. The storms are easing. The wind’s dropping to nothing...°”\nGUTHRIE: Never seen the likes of this, never in all my years...”\nBEV: TARRANT Look at the dust. Not a ripple... (The scream of a dust shark cuts through the silence) Good God! Dust sharks. Why are they singing like that?\nGUTHRIE: They knows. Knows somethin’s a comin’...”\nBEV: TARRANT Any luck raising that ship yet?\nGUTHRIE: Nope. Just sittin’ there in orbit, it is, waitin’...””\nBEV: TARRANT Well I'm not waiting any longer. I’m going to find the Doctor and Ace.\nGUTHRIE: Won’t make any odds girl. Told you before. Duchamp is where they send you to die...\nSALVADORI: What about me? What part do I play in this scheme of yours? Are you planning to kill me?”*\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Oh no, madame, you and Mr Klemp can still play some small part in my plans.\nSALVADORI: __ I will do nothing to help you.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Oh, but you will, madame. To stay alive a little longer, to\nSALVADORI: 174\nSALVADORI: preserve your own miserable skin you will do as I ask. And it is such a little favour I need from you.\nSALVADORI: What... what is it you want me to do?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Contact your protegé on the planet below. Tell him that his audience is assembled. Tell him that we wait to be dazzled by his brilliance.\nSALVADORI: No.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER You would like Mr Klemp to be reduced to the size of a toy?\nKLEMP: Madame...\nSALVADORI: All right. Whatever you say. Just leave him alone.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Good. Oh, and madame. No tricks. I would hate you to miss the show.\nSALVADORI: There is the bleep of a communications console.\nSALVADORI: Duchamp, this is Gallery. Damien? Are you there?\nDAMIEN: (Over) Madame Salvadori. I was beginning to worry.” I tracked your ship into orbit, but then...\nSALVADORI: Is everything ready there, Damien?\nDAMIEN: COver) Yes, madame. All J require is...\nSALVADORI: Then get on with it.\nDAMIEN: (Over) At... ab once.” Is everything all right, Madame Salvadori?\nDAMIEN: SALVADORI Of course it is. I'm paying for your art, not your conversation. Gallery out.\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER Bravo, madame, bravo. A shame that we are enemies, we could be useful allies.\nSALVADORI: Don’t flatter yourself. What happens now?\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Now, Madame Salvadori, you shall see what true genius is.\nACE: So how does Damien fit into all this? What does he want with the painting?\nACE: THE DOCTOR It’s more a question of what the painting wants with him. The Warp Core has been exerting an influence on certain individuals, certain character types. Visionaries, psychics, sensitives...\nACE: Artistic types?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Exactly. It’s using Damien to gain its freedom.\nACE: But how?\nACE: THE DOCTOR I don’t know yet, Ace, I don’t know.\nBEV: TARRANT (Distant) Doctor? Ace?\nACE: That’s Bev! Over here! .\nBEV: TARRANT Thank God I've found you.” Where the hell is everyone? The place is like a morgue. Look, something really weird is going on. The entire planet is still. The dust is like a millpond.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Or a blank canvas... Of course!\nACE: What is it, Doctor?\nACE: THEDOCTOR Damien plans to release the Warp Core into the dust of the planet, every particle of dust will become part of it, a living sentient planet.\nBEV: TARRANT But that’s impossible!\nBEV: 175\nBEV: THE DOCTOR The destruction of the refuelling base was just a test. I told you that the dust was being manipulated telepathically.\nBEV: ACE And the creature in the painting...\nBEV: HE DOCTOR Is pure mental energy... It wants to be released, We’ve got to get everyone off this planet.\nACE: How? We'll never get everyone into the TARDIS in time.\nBEV: TARRANT The ship!\nBEV: THEDOCTOR What?\nBEV: TARRANT An unidentified ship entered orbit about twenty minutes ago. We’ve got no communication with it yet...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Is your ship back at the base?\nBEV: TARRANT Yes, but I’ve got no fuel...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Then steal some! You're a thief aren't you? Contact all the other refuelling bases. Tell them to get into their shuttlecraft and head for that ship...\nBEV: TARRANT But we've got no idea if it’s safe.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR [If I’m right then anywhere is going to be safer than here. You have to get everyone off this planet! Ace, go with her.”\nACE: Now hang on a minute... 3\nACE: THE DOCTOR I haven’t got time to argue! Just go!”\nBEV: TARRANT Come on, Ace! (Running away) Good luck, Doctor.\nACE: (Fading as she goes) You just take care, all right.\nACE: THE DOCTOR  ['ll join you later. (Beat, then) Now, Mr Damien. I have an appointment for a private viewing.\nACE: The painting is starting to throb, building and building.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Damien...\nDAMIEN: Ah, Doctor, you're just in time\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR I always try to be.\nDAMIEN: It’s a beautiful thing, an unblemished canvas, waiting for an artist to bring it to life, to turn it into a work of beauty. Let me show you, Doctor. Let me show you my studio, the means by which I can shape a world.” THE DOCTOR How long has the painting talked to you, Damien? How long since it first appeared in your mind?\nDAMIEN: (Dreamily) I always felt it. It was always there. From the first time I saw it, in the hands of a collector, so long ago... so long... THE DOCTOR Pamien, you need help. You need...\nDAMIEN: (Scornfuh A doctor? Is that what you think I need? THE DOCTOR You don’t understand what it is that’s controlling you.\nDAMIEN: I understand perfectly! You think I’m crazy, don’t you? A\nDAMIEN: dysfunctional madman with an insane ambition. Well you’re wrong, Doctor. Look at what I’ve created! (A door opens) Are they all mad too? Are they, Doctor?\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR What have you done to them?\nDAMIEN: T have done nothing! I let them achieve communion. I let them share the vision. They entered the depravation tanks of their own free will! Surrendered their minds to me because they believed in what I was doing. Because they wanted to be part of this!\nDAMIEN: 176\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR And did they know that this was to be their contribution? To be exhibited like... like fish in an aquarium? To lose all sense and feeling in order to fulfil your artistic vision? To help you destroy a world? DAMIEN To help me create a masterpiece! And when I join myself to it...\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Damien, listen to me! If you connect yourself to this network of minds you will give the Warp Core the power it needs. It will use the mental web you have created here to escape into the dust of this planet.\nDAMIEN: ‘Yes! I will create a living breathing work of art. A planet sized monument to my vision.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR You will create a monster!\nDAMIEN: I will be immortal! THE DOCTOR No!\nDAMIEN: Too late Doctor, my mind is with theirs! (The switeh is\nDAMIEN: depressed, The throbbing noise of the painting builds and builds. Damien's voice becomes alien and distorted) FREEEE!\nDAMIEN: There is the roar of @ shuttlecraft lifting off.\nBEV: TARRANT Is that everyone?\nACE: Everyone but us.\nBEV: TARRANT Where’s Guthrie?\nACE: Beats me. Must have gone on the shuttle.\nBEV: TARRANT I didn’t see him.\nACE: He’ll be fine, Bev. I told him what Damien plans to do. He may be a bit odd, but he’s not stupid enough to hang around here.\nACE: The Damien/Warp core voice bellows over the wind.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE (Over) Free! Free at last!\nBEV: TARRANT Uh, Ace. I think we’d better get out of here. Right now.\nACE: I think you're right. Come on Bev!\" The bar door closes.\nGUTHRIE: (To himself) Heh.” I know what Damien plans to do all\nGUTHRIE: right. And I always knew I was goin’ to die on Duchamp.\nGUTHRIE: 51, INT. THE OUTHOUSE. The throbbing noise is deafening.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Kun, Time Lord! Run while you can! Before the Krill arrive. Before the battle is joined!\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR (Sellowing above the noise) There’s no need for this!\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Run, Doctor. (There is a peal of maniacal and scary laughter) RUN!\nDAMIEN: There is a screaming wind.\nACE: Is that your ship?\nBEV: TARRANT Yes. (Above the wind we hear the mad laughter) My God, what is that?\nACE: If the Doctor is right, the end of the world!\nACE: 177\nACE: A door slides shut, cutting out some of the noise.\nBEV: TARRANT Computer! Engage primary drives.\nACE: My God, look at the dust!®\nBEV: TARRANT Hold tight Ace, this is going to be rough. The engines of the ship roar into life.\nBEV: 84, INT. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. The door opens and the Doctor bundles in.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Wot the most successful day you’ve ever had, Doctor.\nBEV: He activates the scanner control. We hear wind and the raging warp core.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE (Over) The battle will be joined!\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Time to join Ace I think. Now... where’s that mysterious ship? Ah...\nDAMIEN: There are bleeps from the console as the Doctor sets the co-ordinates. The\nTARDIS: dematerialises.\nTARDIS: The engines settle to a low whine.\nBEV: TARRANT I don’t want to have to do that again in a hurry.\nACE: Now what?\nBEV: TARRANT Now we find this uncommunicative space ship. (The console bleeps as Bev scans) There she is, low orbit.\nACE: Hey... that’s a fancy looking ship.\nBEV: TARRANT Pleasure cruiser. God knows what she’s doing out here... Computer, match vectors. Lock on to her homing beacon. (Bleep) Here we go...\nBEV: 56, INT. ‘GALLERY’ CORRIDOR The TARDIS materialises and the door opens.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Good evening. I’m the Doctor and... (He breaks off) Hmm. Nobody home. Hello? Ace?\nBEV: We hear the computerised voice of the lift in the distance. The Doctor walks over.\nLIFTVOICE: Which floor please? Which floor please?\nLIFTVOICE: THE DOCTOR Wow then, let me see. Cabins, dining rooms... Ah! Ballroom.\nUFTVOICE: Thank you. Doors closing.\nUFTVOICE: A big heavy sounding door opens. Bev and Ace enter the docking bay, footfals echoing.\nACE: Hey, where is everyone?\nBEV: TARRANT [ don’t understand it. All the shuttlecraft have docked okay... All the guys should be up here.\nACE: Hello! Hey is anyone about?\nBEV: TARRANT Ace...\nBEV: 178\nACE: Hellooo!\nBEV: TARRANT Ace... Look. I think that’s the base commander. I think that’s Fredrickson... (There is a scuffle from the far side of the docking bay) Ace, there's something there.*\nACE: Move back. Quietly...\nBEV: TARRANT Ace, what is it?’\nBEV: We hear a man scream — until cut off\nACE: We've got to get out of here, Bev, now.\nBEV: TARRANT What?\nACE: Off here. Get back into your ship.\nBEV: TARRANT Too late. There is a scream from Bev.\" And the hissing shriek of a Krill.\nLIFTVOICE: Ballroom. Lift opening.”\nLIFTVOICE: THE DOCTOR Sorry to intrude, but... Oh no... What has happened here? Ace? Bev? (He steps forward, glass crunching underfoot. There is a chuckle from the gloom) Who is it? Who's there? Do you need help?\nKLEMP: Do not move.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR Don't be afraid. ’'m not going to hurt you.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER But Mr Klemp may well kill you unless you do exactly as you are told. Oh, my dear Doctor. Always the good Samaritan. Always stepping into other people’s misfortune.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR The Master...\nKLEMP: THE MASTER A delightful, if unexpected pleasure...\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR AU this death, this destruction. Your handiwork?\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Oh yes, a means to an end.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR 1 will stop you, you know, whatever it is you are up to. THE MASTER 0h, I don’t think so.

When Dust Breeding came up and I knew I wanted her hubby, I'l! be completely honest, having Carrie along in the same play was the perfect smokescreen. We were able to pitch the publicity along the lines that former Who companion Caroline John was playing the wicked Madame Salvadori in a story featuring the Krill (monsters created by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry for one of their novels). As a sideline, it was, “Oh, and Caroline’s husband Geoffrey Beevers will also be along, playing the part of fellow art dealer, Seta.” Worked like a dream and Seta’s secret remained so until the end of this episode - and I made sure we never put “Mr Seta” anywhere in print! Carrie arrived on the Sunday morning and asked me if she could do Salvadori with an accent, which hadn't ever crossed my mind, as she wanted to play a character part rather than just use her own voice. A mix of Russian, Eastern Europe and Italian ended up in the mix and occasionally I felt her geography slipped between fines. Carrie, quite rightly, pointed out that Salvadori wasn’t from Earth and thus whatever she did was just the local accent of Persius Major of wherever she hailed from. Can't argue with logic like that. I asked Mark Donovan to do the voice of the unscripted ambassador in this scene. I flirted with the idea of getting him to do it as the Gulfrarg Ambassador he‘d played in the Benny adventure The Extinction Event, but as that character only spoke in expletives, the joke wouldn’t have worked here.’",

She’s upset at his death and that’s great. Mark Donovan had done a Benny for me previously. Now i don’t think Mark will be too offended if I point out that he’s a big guy, but Klemp is clearly meant to be a bit of a wimpy, Grimtongue-like fusspot. A great thing about audio is you can cast against type — Mark’s always getting roles as bruisers and bouncers and ‘token fat guy’ because people don’t look beyond the physical. Audio has no such pigeon-holing and more than one person on meeting Mark afterwards has commented to me that they can't square the picture in their heads of Klemp with the real Mark.

He was concerned that he got the voice right and as I'd brought along a VHS of The Keeper of Traken I was able to show it to him. It was educational for Sophie and Sylvester who, only being familiar with Anthony Ainley, were bemused by the references to the Master’s physical deformity in the script but once they saw Geoffrey's performance in Traken, it all made sense. Geoffrey then went into the recording booth and began — and that gorgeous voice was there. We discussed various ways to differentiate between the Master with mask and sans mask and in the end settled on the effective thing of having him put his hand between his mouth and the mike, thus just deadening it enough. When he “took off the mask” he did this by slowly raising his hand during the course of his tines, and so without any of Gareth jenkins’s trickery pokery, the mask came off aurally.’",

I've already won, Doctor!\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE After centuries of watching and waiting, to be able to move again, to reach out into the void, unfettered by the pinpricking minds of others.\nDAMIEN: It laughs.\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER Once again it seems our paths are irrevocably linked, Doctor. That you should appear here at all is surprise enough, that you should survive the attentions of the Warp Core... You must have a charmed life.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Whereas life hasn't be treating you so kindly, by the look of it.\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER A foolish mistake on my part. I underestimated the mental instability of the creature.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR Careless of you.\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER A mistake I shall learn to live with.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR (interrupting) You know that the Core has become activated?” That its ancient enemies are here?\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER The Krill. But of course, Doctor. Who do you think brought them here?\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR (Appalied) You mean the Krill are on this ship? But Ace and the others are out there!”!\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER Forget your companions, Doctor. By now there will be nothing left of them.\nDAMIEN: 64, INT, ‘GALLERY’ SHUTTLE BAY. The hissing gets louder.\nBEV: TARRANT (Whispering) What the hell is it?\nACE: It’s called a Krill.\nBEV: TARRANT What's it doing here?\nACE: Killing people.\nBEV: TARRANT Why doesn’t it attack? Surely it’s seen us?\nACE: Or at least heard us. It seems more interested in the hatchway. As if it was trying to get out, into space.\nBEV: TARRANT Those doors are blast proof.\nACE: Believe me, that won't stop it.\nACE: The hissing of the Krill gets louder, more aggressive, it tears through the door.\nBEV: TARRANT J don't believe it!\nACE: Told you.”\nACE: An alarm starts to sound.\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Warning. Atmospheric seals breached. Hull integrity compromised.\nBEV: TARRANT We've got to get out of here!\nACE: We'll never get past it!\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Cargo bay will be sealed in twenty seconds. Nineteen seconds.\nBEV: TARRANT We don’t have a lot of choice! Come on!\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Cargo bay sealing in four seconds.”*\nCOMPUTER: The girls start to run. More Klaxons sound. The Krill roars.\nBEV: TARRANT I think it’s seen us now!\nBEV: Krill roar, then shriek as it is sucked into space and dies away.\nACE: Don’t look back Bev! Just keep going!\nCOMPUTER: VOIGE Three seconds.\nBEV: TARRANT We're not going to make it!\nBEV: 181\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Two seconds\nACE: Yes...\nCOMPUTER: VOICE One second.\nACE: We...\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Doors sealed There is a clang of doors.\nACE: Are! (Breathless) We did it. We did it! ;\nBEV: TARRANT J don't believe it. It must have punched its way out into space. Why? se\nACE: Who cares? We escaped.\nACE: The two of them catch their breath. There is the distant roar of a Krill.\nBEV: TARRANT But escaped into what?\nBEV: The klaxons boom around the room.\nBEV: KLEMP The ship’s outer hull has been punctured, Master. The cargo bay is sealed off.\nBEV: {THE MASTER Ah. Ferhaps the ship is not as dead as I thought.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Acc?\nBEV: THE MASTER Possibly. Your young companion is certainly resourceful. THE DOCTOR i'm going to help her.\nBEV: THE MASTER Please, Doctor. No heroics. I may not be quite my old self, but Mr Klemp here will kill you without a moment’s hesitation if I so order it, and I would hate you to miss out the full extent of your defeat. THE DOCTOR You're insane. You can’t possibly hope to control the Krill the way you control this poor devill\nBEV: THE MASTER Oh, there aren’t many of them, Doctor. Just enough to prick at the dormant consciousness of the Warp Core, just enough to goad it into life\nBEV: THE DOCTOR But the Krill are unstoppable! Savage, aggressive. Believe me, I know.\nBEV: THE MASTER And you think I don't? You think I haven't catered for every eventuality?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR You hadn't catered for me.\nBEV: THE MASTER No. Like a bad penny, you keep turning up...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Why here? Why Duchamp 331?\nBEV: THE MASTER Not my choice, Doctor. The Warp Core’s. I... indulged it, shall we say. Let it return home.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Home?\nBEV: THE MASTER This is where it was born, Doctor. Duchamp is where its creators first unleashed it upon their unsuspecting attackers, where they finally realised that they had a weapon that could defeat the Krill.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And it destroyed their world.\nBEV: THE MASTER Yes, Doctor. This was a world like any other, teeming with a and the Warp Core destroyed it as easily as I would crush an insect.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR And that's what you want? To unleash it again?\nBEV: THE MASTER I have tracked it through time, Doctor. Followed its trail from this world. Found it on Earth...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Where it nearly destroyed you! THE MASTER Yes, it almost destroyed me! Me, a Time Lord. (He laughs)\nBEV: 182\nBEV: It was just hanging there Doctor, hanging in a miserable gallery, the gawping masses unable to understand what they were looking at. And I thought that I could just walk in and take it.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (Gently) What happened?\nBEV: THE MASTER I was complacent. I thought nothing of a few security guards, a few pitiful alarms. I stole it, Doctor, but had not anticipated its reaction. It was recuperating, resting, and I had disturbed its rest.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Like prodding a sleeping tiger.\nBEV: THE MASTER Yes. And like a tiger it toyed with me. That useless body I obtained on Traken was just not strong enough to withstand such energies. It shredded me, stole away the power given to me by the Traken Source, and then just rolled over and went back to sleep\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Leaving you just as you were before. Scarred, damaged and unable to regenerate. I’m... sorry.\nBEV: THE MASTER Sorry? It was magnificent! And it is that power that I intend to possess. Why else do you think I convinced that ridiculous Damien Pierson to buy the painting from me and suggested that he established his absurd studio on this particular planet?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR I never really saw you as 2 patron of the arts, I have to say.\nBEV: THE MASTER I must agree. But I saw that he had the potential, the drive and the ambition to use the creature. I also found in Salvadori a vain and fawning cretin, someone who would be interested enough in funding Damien’s grand schemes just to make her ‘name’ amongst her fraternity.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Of course, and Damien's ‘art’ would this time dilute the\nBEV: raw power enough for you, so you could siphon it off for your own ends.\nBEV: Brilliant and quite audacious. Utterly corrupt, of course, and vile in the\nBEV: extreme, but certainly audacious.\nBEV: THE MASTER Thank you. You see, I have waited patiently, Doctor. Years\nBEV: I have waited. I have set events in motion that would result in this\nBEV: moment, the creature let loose upon its mortal enemy, the Krill, a battle\nBEV: that will drain it, exhaust it, and then...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR You intend to capture it.\nBEV: THE MASTER This time I have come prepared. I intend to transfer the\nBEV: power of the Core to the heart of my TARDIS, to bind it there, captive to\nBEV: my will, answering to my voice, doing my bidding!”\nBEV: TARRANT You've seen these things before haven't you?\nACE: Unfortunately. They’re called the Krill. They're a kind of biological super weapon, and they’re not friendly. They almost wiped out an entire colony that the Doctor and I visited a while back. (There is 2 scuffle from the gloom) Quiet. Listen. There's something in here with us.°\nBEV: TARRANT Krill?\nACE: We'd be dead by now if there were. (Another scuffle. Then @ sob of relief) That’s no Krill.\nSALVADORI: Oh thank God! Thank God!\nACE: It’s okay. It's all right.\nSALVADORI: [I though I was alone.\nBEV: TARRANT Who are you? What the hell happened?\nBEV: 183\nSALVADORI: My name is Salvadori. Madame Elsa IJvanovitch Carolina...” ;\nACE: All right, all right. We get the picture. ;\nSALVADORI: He sent me out here.” Alone in the dark, with those things...\nBEV: TARRANT Who? I ;\nSALVADORI: Seta. He calls himself Seta. (There is the screaming hiss of a Krill, distant) They killed everyone, tore them to pieces.\nACE: How many of them are there?\nSALVADORI: 0h, I don’t know... ;\nACE: Well think! I’ve got to know what we’re up against.\nACE: 100\nSALVADORI: Four, I think. Yes, Klemp said there were four eggs.\nBEV: TARRANT Klemp?\nSALVADORI: My assistant\nBEV: TARRANT And where is he?\nBEV: SALVADORI- That monster Seta is forcing him to work with him. Oh, poor Klemp.\nACE: What about the rest of the crew? The passengers?\nSALVADORI: Dead, all dead. Those creatures just burst into the ballroom...\nBEV: TARRANT Ballroom? Hey, at least we get to die in style.\nACE: We're not dead yet. Could you get us back up to this ballroom?\nSALVADORI: Well... yes... But the rest of those things...\nACE: You said there were only four. Well one has just decided\nACE: to step outside for a Dit...\nBEV: TARRANT Leaving us with only three bloodthirsty unstoppable alien super weapons to get past. Great.\nBEV: There is another shrieking hiss.\nACE: You’d rather we stayed here?\nBEV: TARRANT What good is it going to do us getting up to the ballroom? Unless you were planning on taking tango lessons.\nBEV: ACE The Doctor could have materialised anywhere on the ship.\nSALVADORI: Doctor?\nBEV: TARRANT Friend of ours. Good at getting out of situations like this.\nACE: Yeah, but as he’s not down here, we’d better start looking elsewhere.\nBEV: TARRANT How can you be sure he’s even arrived yet?\nACE: If he isn’t, we’re in even bigger trouble\nBEV: TARRANT That’s not very comforting...\nSALVADORI: If he’s wandering around alone...\nACE: So let’s hope we can find him first. Now come on!\nACE: Guthrie is humming to himself - something American South (The Great Grand Coolie Dam, or similar). The computer hums into life.\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Purging operation initiated. All fuel tanks on stations A through F now in emergency venting mode.\nGUTHRIE: Heh, thank you, girl. You can shut down for a while. J think someone’s a’comin’.'”\nCOMPUTER: VOICE Yes, technician Guthrie. Shutting down.\nCOMPUTER: 184\nCOMPUTER: There is the crash of wind and the throb of the Warp Core.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE (Alien and rasping) What have we here? A little man. All alone.\nGUTHRIE: Heh, there you are at last, boy. Knew you'd show up eventually.'”\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE! sensed that there was still life here, that not everyone had run. Why haven’t you run away, little man?\nGUTHRIE: Run? (He laughs and coughs) Bin’ waitin’ fer yer. Waitin’ a long time. There’s bad blood between us. Scores to settle.’\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Do you know who I am?\nGUTHRIE: Yup. Reckon you’re the thing that killed my partner.'” That dragged him into the dust of this God-forsaken planet and left me to live with it...\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE (Laughs horribly) And so you’ve waited all this time for your revenge? Waited all this time to stand against me?\nGUTHRIE: That's just about the size of it.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Pitiful creature. If you only had an inkling of the power standing before you you would run screaming.\nGUTHRIE: Well as I said. I’ve never bin a great one fer runnin’.’”*\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE And just what do you expect to do?\nGUTHRIE: Well... I wuz plannin’ on killing you.'\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Killing me? (The Warp Core gives a shriek of Jaughter) Humans, with your intellect, and your ambition. You know nothing of true hate, true rage, but up there is an enemy perfect in every way... oh I can feel them, fee] their hate, their anger. Even now one of them struggles through the void, and all I have to do is flex the muscles of this planet...\nDAMIEN: A low rumble builds.\nDAMIEN: The rumble shakes the ship.\nACE: What the hell was that?\nBEV: TARRANT Ace look! Look out of the window.\nACE: Oh my God.\"\nBEV: TARRANT The planet! It’s moving! The dust is forming into shapes!\nACE: It’s like the planet is growing limbs... That’s why the Krill\nACE: tore its way out. It’s going to attack it.\nSALVADORI: Oh, Damien, my dear. Bravo. You were a genius after all.\nACE: Believe me, there’s nothing artistic about what's going on down there...\nSALVADORI: Oh, it is magnificent. What a shame your audience is dead.\nBEV: TARRANT I’m sure his audience would agree with you!\nBEV: There are screams of rage that echo around them.\nACE: Well it’s certainly rattled the Krill.\nBEV: TARRANT And that probably isn’t good news for us.\nBEV: The rumble reaches the ship.\nBEV: THE MASTER 4h, Doctor, look. After centuries of sleep the Warp Core is stretching itself. Mp Klemp.\nBEV: 185,\nKLEMP: Yes, Master.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Monitor the creature from my TARDIS as you have been instructed.\nKLEMP: Yes, Master.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Let me know when power levels reach critical.\nKLEMP: Yes, Master.\nKLEMP: Klemp crosses the ballroom. Glass crunching underfoot. A TARDIS door opens.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR Your TARDIS disguised as a pillar again. (He tuts) You’re not very original.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Unoriginal, but practical.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR The thing that you have created is a terrifying concept. A planet with the rage and appetites of a mindless killer.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER And with the Krill as bait, as lures, I can direct it where Twill.\nKLEMP: There is the screech of tortured metal as the planet starts to reach the ship.\nKLEMP: THE DOCTOR Your pet seems to have reacquired its taste for Krill. It’s realised it can build with the dust to reach out for the ship and tear it apart.’ Do you really think that you are any safer up here than the rest of us? THE MASTER 0h I don’t intend staying here, Doctor. However luxurious these surroundings are, my TARDIS is far more comfortable. I think it’s time for our little game to reach an unhappy conclusion\nKLEMP: 70, INT. ‘GALLERY’ CORRIDOR. The ship gives a protesting screech of metal.\nSALVADORI: What is it? What’s happening?\nBEV: TARRANT I think Duchamp 331 is throwing a tantrum.\nACE: We've got to get off this ship!\nBEV: TARRANT Well we're not going to get back into the docking bay.\nACE: Then we'll keep going until we find the TARDIS. Salvadori.\nACE: Where's the nearest lift?\nSALVADORI: Just down here. One of the staff lifts.\nACE: Right. Come on.\nBEV: TARRANT Ace, how do you know there aren't any Krill waiting for us up there?\nACE: I don’t but I know there are definitely some down here, so I figure we're not going to be any worse off.\nBEV: TARRANT Your logic is not encouraging.\nBEV: AcE The corridor looks clear. I’m going to check out that lift.\nBEV: TARRANT Be careful.\nACE: Just watch my back.\nACE: She runs over to the lift.\nLIFT: VOICE Doors opening. Which floor please?\nACE: Right. Coast's clear. Come on!\nBEV: TARRANT Okay, after you.\nSALVADORI: I’m not sure I can do this, those things...\nBEV: TARRANT Are out there somewhere. You’re probably safer with us.\nSALVADORI: [I’m not sure.\nBEV: TARRANT Look, I'll go first. As soon as I'm in the lift, you run over and join us, okay?\nBEV: 186\nACE: What are you two waiting for?\nBEV: TARRANT Okay?\nSALVADORI: All right.\nSALVADORI: Bev runs over to Ace.\nACE: What’s up with matron?\nBEV: TARRANT She’s scared witless, Ace. (There is the sudden roar of a Krill. Salvadori screams) Oh God, it’s seen her.\nSALVADORI: Help me! Please!\nACE: We'd better get out of here.\nBEV: TARRANT You can't just leave her!\nACE: There’s nothing we can do.\nBEV: TARRANT J don’t believe this! You're just going to sit back and let her die?\nACE: Bev, I've fought these things before! You can’t beat them, do you understand? You can’t! You've just got to shut them out, shut out what they do and just try and live with yourself afterwards.’”\nBEV: TARRANT Damn you! I’m not just going to sit back and watch that ing tear her apart. Bev! No! Bev TRERANT (Bellowing at the Kril) Hey! Get off her you ugly great frog! I said get off! The screams of the Krill rise in pitch.\nACE: I don't believe it!\nSALVADORI: Help me!\nBEV: TARRANT Come on. Come on!\nACE: Inside! Inside!\nLIFT: VOICE Doors closing. There is a ching as the doors close.\nBEV: TARRANT Unbeatable are they?\nACE: I still don’t believe it. You actually seared it off! There is the tearing of metal as the Krill tries to get at them.\nBEV: TARRANT Maybe scared was a little strong.\nSALVADORI: It’s getting in!\nLIFT: VOICE Which floor please?\nACE: Up, you damn piece of junk, up!\nLIFT: VOICE Thank you.

I know that right enough. Always knew I’d die on Duchamp 331.\nDAMIEN: / WARP CORE (Laughing) I can waste no more time with you. My ancient enemies grow impatient.

Mark my words.\nDAMIEN: 187\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER [ will admit to a certain degree of sadness at your demise, Doctor. There really are so few worthy opponents in the universe these days. Perhaps I will keep your shrunken corpse as a memento.\nDAMIEN: THE DOCTOR How sentimental of you.\nKLEMP: Power readings at maximum, Master.\nKLEMP: THE MASTER Goodbye, Doctor.\nLIFT: VOICE Ballroom. Doors opening.\nLIFT: The lift door opens.\nACE: Doctor! Talk about climbing out of the frying pan...'\" THE DOCTOR Ace! Get back in the lift!\nACE: But Doctor!\nACE: THE MASTER Ah, the Doctor's pugnacious companion. I would advise you to stay perfectly still or Mr Klemp here will happily atomise you.

Who's Freddy Krueger?\nSALVADORI: That animal is Seta.\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR That is the Master.'’*\nSALVADORI: ACE The Master? With a face like a dropped pizza? What happened to him?\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR He had a little difference of opinion with the creature down there on the planet. It stripped his borrowed body from him — de-generated him. This is the Master as he really is.\nACE: Suits him.\nACE: THE MASTER The creature cam renew me once it is safely under my control.\nBEV: TARRANT Control? That creature has decided that it’s not content to stay on that planet from what we've just seen.''®\nBEV: THE DOCTOR No. The Warp Core is animating the dust in vast quantities, forming tendrils, reaching out to attack the Krill on this ship. The ship lurches again.\nBEV: TARRANT And it hasn't exactly put our psychopathic planet in the best of moods.\nBEV: THE MASTER I wouldn't let that worry you, my dear. You're not going to be alive long enough for it to be an inconvenience.\nSALVADORI: Oh, why don’t you just let Klemp go. Let us all go.\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR There's no need for this. You’ve got me.\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER Very noble Doctor, as always, but you are in no position to bargain.\nSALVADORI: The throbbing of the Warp Core fills the ship.\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Salvadoril\nBEV: TARRANT Good God! Look outside the window!

I the Master have released you!\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE You? Released me?\nDAMIEN: THE MASTER Yes. All of this has been my plan. To give you your freedom once more. These primitives have merely been puppets. Salvadori, Klemp, even Damien... All of them, puppets to my will.\nSALVADORI: Damien? Is that you, my dear?\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Ah... Salvadori, at last...\nSALVADORI: Magnificent, my dear, but you're starting to frighten us now...\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE Frighten you? I did this for you.

Go!\nSALVADORI: Klemp...\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR Come on!\nSALVADORI: THE MASTER No, I am the Master. You will obey me.'”\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR You'll never get it to obey you. Don’t you understand? All it is is hate. Unreasoning hate!\nSALVADORI: The Core roars.\nACE: Doctor! Come on!\nACE: THE DOCTOR It hates you as it hates ail things. You've been used. You’ve lost.\nACE: 189\nACE: THE MASTER (Distant) No! This is not how it should be!\nBEV: TARRANT Doctor, get out of there!\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Come on, Madame Salvadori. Run. (The Doctor and Salvadori run. The Core rages around them) Hold that door!\nBEV: THE MASTER (Distant) All right Doctor, run if you can. You will never reach the safety of your TARDIS. The Warp Core will catch up with you soon enough!\nBEV: He enters his TARDIS, which dematerialises. Slightly different sound from the Doctor's?\nBEV: They fall panting into the lift as the door closes. Salvadori sobbing.”\nSALVADORI: Oh my poor Klemp...\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR There was nothing you could do. The Master was controlling him.\nSALVADORI: But he didn’t kill me. He wouldn’t kill me.\nSALVADORI: THE DOCTOR (Gently) No. The Master's influence is almost impossible to resist. He must have thought a great deal of you.\nSALVADORI: SALVADORI And look where it got him...\nACE: So, now what do we do?\nACE: THE DOCTOR The Warp Core will tear the ship apart to get at the remaining Krill.'’’ We've got to get back to the TARDIS.\nACE: Which is where exactly?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Unfortunately somewhere on the lower levels with the Krill.\nACE: No problem... we'll just send Bev in to frighten any Krill off.

Both of you.\nBEV: TARRANT [ don’t see that this is going to help. Apart from a few\nBEV: Reedab pennies all I’ve got is fluff and...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Dust!

Take my handkerchief. Brush the dust from your\nBEV: clothes. Gather as much of it as you can.'**\nBEV: Gey TARRANT And we throw it in their faces and make them sneeze to eal\nBEV: THE DOCTOR (impatient) The dust can be controlled telepathically!

Not out in the dark.\nBEV: TARRANT You'll be fine.\nSALVADORI: (To herself, quietly) Oh Klemp, what have I done? Am I responsible for all this? What should I do now?\nACE: Ready Doctor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Right. Contact...\nACE: The background noise of the Master’s TARDIS should be distinctive and different from the Doctor's. There is the bleep of controls.\nACE: THE MASTER (To himseif) Telepathic activity? What are you up to, Doctor? Still trying to reach the safety of your own TARDIS?\nBEV: TARRANT Ace, look! Look at the dust!\nACE: I can’t, I'm too busy looking after the Doctor — any chance of a helping hand?\nBEV: TARRANT Ob yeah, sorry...\nACE: Here we go!\nACE: From outside the Krill screams in rage.\nBEV: TARRANT The Doctor’s telepathic commands.

What are you doing?\nSALVADORI: Don’t you see? It’s far too late, and I’ve become far too old to live without my wealth or without Klemp. Stop that animal Seta for me, my dears.

She didn’t have to.\nACE: We wouldn’t have made it without her.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Ah, ladies. I gather my cunning plan worked then.\nACE: Yes, Professor, it worked, but we lost Salvadori.\nBEV: TARRANT She just... just let them take her.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Bev, I’m sorry. If I... -\nBEV: TARRANT Can we just get off this ship?!”\nBEV: The Doctor operates controls and the TARDIS dematerialises.\nBEV: THE MASTER Ingenious as ever, Doctor, but still too late to stop me. He stabs at controls.\nBEV: The bum of the TARDIS in flight.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Ace, turn on the scanner, would you?\nBEV: There is a hum as it operates.\nBEV: TARRANT Good God...\nACE: I don’t believe it.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Impressive isn’t it, watching a planet sized mass moving like a living thing...? Now then...'\nACE: There are the bleeps from controis.\nACE: Professor. What are you planning?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Exactly what I just did back on the ship, only on a larger scale, utilising the telepathic circuits of the TARDIS to take control of the dust and force the Warp Core back towards Duchamp. (Clears his throat then calls) Ahem. Are you listening, Master?\nACE: THE MASTER (Over) What do you want, Doctor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR You'll see.\nBEV: TARRANT Ace, last time the Doctor was only trying to contro! just @ handkerchief full of dust! He can't possibly hope to manipulate an entire planet.\nACE: If the Doctor says he can do it...\nACE: 192\nACE: THE DOCTOR Thank you for your confidence Ace. Now quiet both of you. Ready Master? Contact... A hum of power starts to build.\nACE: THE MASTER What? No! Doctor... (He stabs at his own scanner control) Doctor... What are you doing?\nACE: (Over) He’s beating you at your own game, pizza face! THE MASTER No! Your will against mine, Doctor? You would fight my mind for control of the Core?!” So be it. (He stabs at his own telepathic controls this time) Contact!\nACE: The noise builds.\nBEV: TARRANT What’s happening, Ace?\nACE: I guess the Master is using his own telepathic circuits.\nBEV: TARRANT Look at the planet! The two of them are tearing it apart!\nDAMIEN: /WARP CORE No! Time Lords no! You aren't strong enough. I will not be trapped again. I will not submit to you. The planet is mine, I tell you.

Highly flammable atmosphere.\nGUTHRIE: Dangerous habit on a refuelling station.\nGUTHRIE: 8S.INT. MASTER’S TARDIS.

There is the Klunk of a lighter.\nDAMIEN: / WARP CORE Nooco0c00! A colossal explosion then silence......\nDAMIEN: 89, INT. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. From total silence we hear Ace's voice, distant at first then louder and more distinct as the Doctor comes around.\nACE: Doctor...? Doctor...?\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Groggy) Ace?'*!\nBEV: TARRANT Oh, thank God. We were beginning to think you would never come round!\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Oh, I’m beginning to wish I hadn't...\nACE: Here, there’s a seat over here.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Duchamp...”\nBEV: TARRANT Gone, vaporised. Completely destroyed. So’s Salvadori’s pleasure cruiser.'*\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Taking the Krill with it, no doubt.\nACE: Wicked explosion, Professor, what did you do?\nACE: THE DOCTOR The planet was tearing itself apart. I could feel the Warp Core in my mind, sense it weakening. Then suddenly it was trying to stop someone else.\nACE: You mean someone else blew the planet up?\nACE: THE DOCTOR The dust was saturated with fuel. That coupled with the Dalekanium power source at its core...\nBEV: TARRANT You mean the stories were true?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Yes. The entire planet was like an enormous bomb. All it would have taken was a single spark...\nBEV: TARRANT Oh my God... Guthrie.\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Bringing his blood feud to a close.'**\nACE: So the Warp Core is dead.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Oh, I doubt it, but it will be scattered in minute particles\nACE: throughout the universe. Enough to give people a few bad dreams, but little else.\nBEV: TARRANT And the Master?\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Who knows? Thrown out into space/time by the shockwave just like we were.‘\nACE: So he’ll turn up again...\nACE: THE DOCTOR Oh yes, I think we can count on that. He still needs to locate the very particular sorts of energies that’ enable him to find a new body. Those energies are few and far between.\nBEV: TARRANT Well. I don't know about you two, but I could do with a break from all this...\nBEV: THE DOCTOR Quite right. How do you fancy a trip to Oslo?\nBEV: 194\nANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, the National Gallery will be closing in just a few minutes.'* Could you please start making your way to the exits?\nANNOUNCER: The announcer repeats in German, then French in the background.\nACE: So it’s there now, in the painting?\nACE: THEDOCTOR Yes, waiting, dormant, sleeping its way through the twentieth century.\nACE: You could stop it you know, stop the Master stealing it, stop all the deaths on Duchamp in the future.\nACE: THE DOCTOR The future has already happened, Ace. We couldn't stop it if we tried.\nACE: So now what?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Now we get Bev back to her own time and space. Where is she, by the way?\nACE: Dunno. She said something about getting you a picture that would cause a lot less bother. (An alarm starts to ring) She wouldn't...\nACE: THE DOCTOR I think she may have.\nACE: I think you should start collecting stamps Doctor, it'll make life a lot easier!\nACE: THE END\nACE: 195\nNOTES: N.B.

Hence the scenes with Tony Keetch and Karen Henson for The Fires of Vulcan were done during The Apocalypse Element, and the Kaled stuff in Davros with Lou Fauikner and Karl Hansen were done during the recording of the Benny play The Bellotron Incident.

I asked Ed Bishop to play the part but for reasons I never got told, his agent said no at the last minute (I was very pleased when we managed to get him years later into Full Fathom Five, one of the Doctor Who Unbound plays) and I had to start casting again with only a few days to go. lan Ricketts was a voice tutor at Nick Pegg’s old drama alma mater, Guildford, so I asked him, as age was more important than accent. lan was terrific but we rewrote as we went along changing the Americanisms to things lan was more comfortable with.’\nNOTES: 18.

Damien was obviously a nod to Damien Hirst, but I think Damien Pierce is an actor so I made it Pierson. A number of people have asked if it was a nod at old Doctor Who artist Alister Pearson, but no, it’s not.

Throughout this speach, the AMBASSADOR is audible:\nSALVADORI: No ambassador.\nAMBASSADOR: No?\nSALVADORI: You are going to have to be patient. It would hardly be a surprise if I let you know what little treat I have in store for you, now would it?\nAMBASSADOR: (Laughs)\nSALVADORI: Ah. If you would excuse me, I think there are some matters that Ineed to attend to. (She crosses the Ballroom.)\nSALVADORI: 198\nAMBASSADOR: Madam.\nSALVADORI: Klemp, the body is safely tucked away, I trust?\nSALVADORI: Gary Russell: I think it was Carrie john’s idea to have the ambassador respond. ! loved Caroline john the first time I met her at a convention in Coventry - she was refreshingly honest about everything and I wanted to work with her on one of these. When Dust Breeding came up and I knew I wanted her hubby, I'l! be completely honest, having Carrie along in the same play was the perfect smokescreen. We were able to pitch the publicity along the lines that former Who companion Caroline John was playing the wicked Madame Salvadori in a story featuring the Krill (monsters created by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry for one of their novels). As a sideline, it was, “Oh, and Caroline’s husband Geoffrey Beevers will also be along, playing the part of fellow art dealer, Seta.” Worked like a dream and Seta’s secret remained so until the end of this episode - and I made sure we never put “Mr Seta” anywhere in print! Carrie arrived on the Sunday morning and asked me if she could do Salvadori with an accent, which hadn't ever crossed my mind, as she wanted to play a character part rather than just use her own voice. A mix of Russian, Eastern Europe and Italian ended up in the mix and occasionally I felt her geography slipped between fines. Carrie, quite rightly, pointed out that Salvadori wasn’t from Earth and thus whatever she did was just the local accent of Persius Major of wherever she hailed from. Can't argue with logic like that. I asked Mark Donovan to do the voice of the unscripted ambassador in this scene. I flirted with the idea of getting him to do it as the Gulfrarg Ambassador he‘d played in the Benny adventure The Extinction Event, but as that character only spoke in expletives, the joke wouldn’t have worked here.’\nSALVADORI: 83.

Wanders into the studio, doing her bit as Executive Producer for BBC Worldwide and making sure we're not messing things up. She has barely sat down before { grab her, chuck her in front of a microphone and tell her to be a sexy lift (she has a very sexy voice).

Line changed to: ‘An unidentified cruiser entered orbit about twenty minutes ago’ Gary Russell: thought “cruiser” sounded bigger than “ship” and also reasoned that a seasoned traveller like Bev would instinctively make that difference. It’s always great to have Lou Faulkner in the studio — she and Sophie and Sylvester got on really well during The Genocide Machine so it seemed a good idea to have them join forces again. Lou was a friend of Nick Briggs but as it turned out also knew Lisa Bowerman, who plays Benny. Which is just as well, as Bev now inhabits the Bennyverse as a direct result of this story...’\nSALVADORI: 78.

Gary Russell: ‘This exchange created a little bit of a furore amongst Doctor Who fans who keep tabs on continuity between the books and audios. Some of them felt this contradicted things set up by the books. Others have since disputed it and suggested that it still af ties together. To be honest, I don't care - 1 was far more concerned with linking the Master’s degeneration with events on TV than in the books. I should also point out that this whole scenario is of my making — Mike Tucker didn’t write this and any time anyone moans at him about it, he rightfully points them in my direction. I just reiterate that my job is to make a good story and let others worry about policing the post-TV series continuity. Which may explain why Mike is more popular with fans than I am!’\nSALVADORI: 97. Line changed to: ‘There’s something in this corridor with us’\nSALVADORI: 98.

Gary Russell: ‘This is a pivotal moment for Ace, and her continued characterisation through subsequent plays, I felt. I never wanted to go down the route that Virgin Books took her, turning her into a mercenary, but I wanted to toughen her up. Later, the realisation of what she was prepared to do here, her abandonment of Salvadori to die, would start her questioning her personal ethics and motives. This wasn’t something Mike or I intended at the time, it was just something I picked up and ran with after the event.’\nA: 110.

The ‘I’ was moved to the start of KLEMP’s next line. Gary Russell: ‘Another great moment and all credit to Mike for writing it and for Carrie and Mark Donovan for pulling it off. I’ve always been fond of “the little guy” or “the assistant” who eventually dies because they‘re caught up in their master’s plans (cf Mr Fibuli or Vogel) and no matter how much of a bitch Salvadori has been to Klemp, his death resonates with her. She’s upset at his death and that’s great. Mark Donovan had done a Benny for me previously. Now i don’t think Mark will be too offended if I point out that he’s a big guy, but Klemp is clearly meant to be a bit of a wimpy, Grimtongue-like fusspot. A great thing about audio is you can cast against type — Mark’s always getting roles as bruisers and bouncers and ‘token fat guy’ because people don’t look beyond the physical. Audio has no such pigeon-holing and more than one person on meeting Mark afterwards has commented to me that they can't square the picture in their heads of Klemp with the real Mark. Which is, excuse the pun, the mark of good acting.’\nA: 119. Line changed to: ‘It’s too late Elsa, he’s dead’\nA: 120. Gary Russell: ‘Well, it wouldn't be right not to have him say it! I cannot praise Geoffrey Beevers enough - the moment he stepped into the studio, he recreated the character he‘d last played in 1980. He was concerned that he got the voice right and as I'd brought along a VHS of The Keeper of Traken I was able to show it to him. It was educational for Sophie and Sylvester who, only being familiar with Anthony Ainley, were bemused by the references to the Master’s physical deformity in the script but once they saw Geoffrey's performance in Traken, it all made sense. Geoffrey then went into the recording booth and began — and that gorgeous voice was there. We discussed various ways to differentiate between the Master with mask and sans mask and in the end settled on the effective thing of having him put his hand between his mouth and the mike, thus just deadening it enough. When he “took off the mask” he did this by slowly raising his hand during the course of his tines, and so without any of Gareth jenkins’s trickery pokery, the mask came off aurally.’\nA: 121.

DRAKEFELL’S OFFICE. EVENING.\nHALTOLLER: Damn you, Drakefell, I cannot believe that you are being so insensitive about this!\nHALTOLLER: DRAKEFELL And I cannot believe that you are being so ignorant.\nHALTOLLER: Ignorant? How dare you! Have you any idea what it is you're doing here?\nDRAKEFELL: I am perfectly aware of what I’m doing, Mr Toller. Ensuring that industry carries on into the twenty-second century.\nHALTOLLER: For God’s sake man, there’s little enough work here at the best of times. Tourism is all that keeps the village going and your plant...\nDRAKEFELL: Is a necessary addition to this community.\nHALTOLLER: Is a prefabricated monstrosity that is driving the visitors away in their droves! You’re destroying this community! It’s not as if you’ve even taken on any staff -— that at least would show some responsibility!\nDRAKEFELL: I can see that this discussion is not going to get us anywhere.\nHALTOLLER: Oh for heaven’s sake, surely you can see...\nDRAKEFELL: This meeting is at an end, Mr Toller. I am a busy man and I really haven’t got any more time to spend on endless debate. I'm sorry that you can't see what we are trying to do here, but I’m afraid that there is nothing that you can do to stop it. You might as well stop trying to fight it.\nHALTOLLER: Right, well we’ll see about that. Good day, sir!\nHALTOLLER: A door slams.\nHALTOLLER: There is the babble of conversation from the bar. The door opens and we hear the barking of a large dog.\nHALTOLLER: Good boy, Saladin, good boy, down now. He’s behaved himself, George?\nGEORGE: Good as gold.\nMARY: How did you get on, Hal?\nGEORGE: Hold on there, girl, let the man get a drink inside him first.\nMARY: Oh come on, Mr Toller, what did he say?\nGEORGE: Get the man a pint, for God’s sake!\nMARY: Ali right, all right! What’ll it be, Hal?\nMARY: HALTOLLER A pint of Best please, Mary.\nGEORGE: I remember a time when bar staff knew their place...\nMARY: ‘Yes, and men dragged their womenfolk around by the\nMARY: hair. Times change, George. Mary thumps a pint of bitter onto the bar.\nMARY: There you go, Hal.\nMARY: 319\nHALTOLLER: Ah, you're a life saver, you really are.\nHALTOLLER: He drinks.\nMARY: Cimpatient) Well?\nHALTOLLER: Oh, it’s a complete waste of time. Talking to that idiot Drakefell is like talking to a brick wall. He cares nothing for the village, and even less for the impact his blasted plant is having on the environment.\nMARY: But you told him about the fish, about the pollution...\nHALTOLLER: Yes...\nHALTOLLER: MARY And about the disease that the foxes have been catching...\nHAL: TOLLER I told him everything, Mary. As I said, the man just isn't interested.\nMARY: But they must see the impact that the plant is having, they must!\nMARY: HALTOLLER The brutal fact, young lady, is that the demise of another small Welsh fishing village is seen as a small price to pay for cheap unlimited fuel. You’ve seen the news reports. It gets worse every day.\nMARY: But these plants of Drakefell’s are causing chaos. You saw the Greenpeace report about his Australian refinery.\nMARY: HALTOLLER And saw how quickly they covered it up.\nMARY: So you're just going to give up? Hal, you can’t...\nHALTOLLER: Hold your horses! Now did I say anything about giving up? I just think that I need to go higher than Drakefell, that’s all.\nGHORGE: Going to head over to Cardiff then, are you?\nHALTOLLER: 1 think so. Try and talk some sense into the local political mnafia. Pll go on to London if I have to.\nMARY: When?\nHALTOLLER: Tomorrow. The longer we hang around, the more damage Drakefell and his machines are going to do to the coast.\nMARY: I'll come with you.\nHALTOLLER: No, Mary. You're a little too outspoken for the political arena. I think that I'd do far better on my own.\nGEORGE: She’s a little too outspoken behind the bar as well if you ask me.\nGEORGE: There is a ripple of laughter in the pub.\nMARY: Now listen, Hal...\nHALTOLLER: (Interrupting) You would be far more use to me compiling some more evidence of exactly how much impact this project is having on the area. We're going to need all the ammunition we can muster if we're going to have a hope in hell. (He takes another swig of beer) You would also be far more use to me if you could put in an order for one of Derek's steak and kidney pies!\nHALTOLLER: A phone rings.\nDRAKEFELL: Drakefell. (A pause) Yes... Really. To London indeed. No... No, that’s quite all right. Leave everything to me.\nDRAKEFELL: From inside the pub we hear the tinkle of a bell.\nDRAKEFELL: 320\nMARY: Come on, you lot. I want those glasses.\nHALTOLLER: Right. I've got a bag to pack and some phonecalls to make. Hopefully I’ see you tomorrow night.\nMARY: Good luck.\nGEORGE: Goodnight, Hal\nHALTOLLER: Night, George. Come on, Saladin.\nHALTOLLER: We hear the bark of a large dog.\nHALTOLLER: S. EXT. PUB CAR PARK. NIGHT. The pub door opens and HAL TOLLER crosses the car park. He fumbles with his car keys. The dog snaris.\nVICAR: You've had a pleasant evening, I trust, Mr Toller.\nHALTOLLER: (Startled) Good God...\nVICAR: Ah... Not quite.\nHALTOLLER: (Embarrassed) Oh, I... Yes, well you gave me quite a shock, vicar.\nVICAR: I do apologise. I’m afraid that the robes of office don't make me the easiest person to see at night.\nVICAR: HALTOLLER And I wasn’t really expecting to see you in a pub car park at midnight.\nVICAR: Ah, well J had some... business to attend to, and I was hoping that I would catch you, Mr Toler.\nHALTOLLER: Really?\nHALTOLLER: vicaR Yes. I understand that you were up at the new fuel plant today.\nHALTOLLER: Yes, that’s right.\nVICAR: Did you have any joy?\nHALTOLLER: No, I’m afraid I did not. The company director is the most unpleasant son of a...\nVICAR: Quite. What will you do now?\nHALTOLLER: I'm heading over to Cardiff in the morning. I've got some friends in the National Assembly, I can let people know what is going on here, if nothing else.\nHALTOLLER: VICAR And if they won’t listen?\nHALTOLLER: Then it's on to London.\nVICAR: London. You are determined, Mr Toller. Well, I'll leave you\nVICAR: to it, you have a long walk across the moor to your house.\nHALTOLLER: No that’s fine, Vicar, I've got the...\nHALTOLLER: VICAR And I’m sure that you weren’t intending to drive. I understand that our local bitter packs quite a punch.\nHALTOLLER: Yes. Yes, you're quite right, vicar, and I’m sure Saladin will appreciate the walk. Won’t you boy? Good night Reverend\nVICAR: Good night, Mr Toller. I will think of you in my prayers.\nVICAR: The chanting of a coven. Low and sinister.\nVICAR: ‘7. EXT. PUB CAR PARK. NIGHT.\nVICAR: Ah, George, there you are.\nGEORGE: Give a man a heart attack you will, creeping around like that.\nGEORGE: 321\nVICAR: You've got what you promised?\nGEORGE: Yes, I’ve got it.\nVICAR: Good. i\nGEORGE: It’s not right, vicar. What you’re asking. It’s not right, VIcaR You're not going to go back on your word now, are you, George?\nGEORGE: No, no I suppose not. Here...\nVICAR: Excellent. Then I'll see you in church tomorrow.\nVICAR: Goodnight, George.\nVICAR: The chanting increases.\nHAL: TOLLER stumbles through the bracken. There is a distant rumble of thunder.\nHALTOLLER: Wretched man. He'll be trying to make me give up smoking yet. Hold on there Saladin. I want to get a light.\nHALTOLLER: The dog starts to bark wildly.\nHALTOLLER: Saladin! Come here!\nHALTOLLER: More barks.\nHALTOLLER: Wretched dog!\nHALTOLLER: The barks become painful yelps. Then a long drawn out how!\nHALTOLLER: Saladin?\nHALTOLLER: The chanting reaches a creccendo.\nHALTOLLER: There is no sound from the dog now, only the crunch of bracken as HAL\nTOLLER: searches.\nHALTOLLER: Saladin? Where are you boy? Saladin? There is a low snarl.\nHALTOLLER: There you are. What the devil got into you? The snarls become vicious, terrifying.\nHALTOLLER: What's the matter, boy? Saladin!\nHALTOLLER: The snarl becomes a horrifying semblance of human speech, guttural and low.\nSALADIN: Human filth.\nHALTOLLER: I don’t believe... No... Stay back...\nSALADIN: All of you will die! DIE!\nHALTOLLER: No... no... NO!!!\nHALTOLLER: There is a horrible scream of terror interspersed with snarls and roars, then silence...\nHALTOLLER: The sound of the TARDIS materialising. The door opens and ACE emerges.\nACE: (Bxasperated) Professor! I thought we were meant to be in the Cretaceous.\nACE: 322\nACE: THE DOCTOR (From inside the TARDIS) And?\nACE: There’s a mammoth out here.\nACE: THE DOCTOR (From inside the TARDIS) So, I’m a little late.\nACE: ACE A fake mammoth!\nACE: THE DOCTOR (From inside the TARDIS) Ahl\nACE: ACE A bad fake mammoth! We’re in a museum!\nACE: THE DOCTOR (Coming out and locking the door) Fascinating places,\nACE: Not from this side of the glass they’re not. THE DOCTOR Ah, no. The TARDIS must have got a little confused.\nACE: You're telling me. How are we going to get out?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Oh, this lock won't take me long to open. It’s not as if they’re expecting any of the exhibits to try and get out.\nPRIDDY: No, our usual problem is people breaking in.\nACE: (Surprised) Gorden Bennett!\nACE: THE DOCTOR Ah, good morning. Assuming it is morning. 'm the Doctor, and this is my friend Ace. I don’t suppose you could... er...\nPRIDDY: Let you out? Of course, of course. ] must say your arrival was quite fascinating.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Yes, well I suppose that does require some explanation...\nPRIDDY: I mean transportation of matter is perfectly feasible of course, but I didn’t expect the manner of transport to be a metropolitan Police Box.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR (Nonplussed) Er, quite...\nPRIDDY: Where did you get it? I’ve been after one for our twentieth century gallery for quite a while. Police box that is, not matter transporter, and whilst it does look very good next to Algernon...\nACE: Who?\nPRIDDY: Algernon. The mammoth. Quite a good replica, don’t you think? Oh, he’s getting a little tatty, I know, but we had a moth problem last year, you see, and...\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR (Interrupting) Excuse me, Mr...?\nPRIDDY: Priddy, Basil Priddy, chief curator.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Delighted. Well excuse me, Mr Priddy, but you don’t seem very concerned with the manner of our arrival.\nPRIDDY: PRIDDY And I don’t expect that you are at liberty to tell me much about it. Official secrets and all that. You work for some kind of government agency I imagine?\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Something like that.\nPRIDDY: Ah, I knew it. Matter transference, UFOs, psi powers — they're all government black ops projects. There have been articles about their existence for years. I know all about them. Never thought that I’d get a chance to see one, though.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Mr Priddy, you said that you've had problems with people breaking in...?\nPRIDDY: Yes, couple of weeks ago. Couple of fascinating Celtic pieces taken. Still no clue as to where they’ve gone.\nPRIDDY: THEDOCTOR Celtic?\nPRIDDY: Yes, from our Celtic collection. Would you care to see? THEDOCTOR Yes, I would.\nACE: Professor, I though we were going to the cretaceous.\nACE: THEDOCTOR Ace!\nACE: 323\nPRIDDY: Cretaceous? Time travel as well? You government boffins really have been busy haven’t you. Knew it was possible of course, I mean that’s how they went back and assassinated Kennedy. Wish you were allowed to talk about it. Never mind. I must give you my card, perhaps you could pick up some specimens for me. The Celtic gallery is this way. He bustles off.\nACE: Professor! What are we doing? He’s mad. A UFO nut. THE DOCTOR Mr Priddy is a little eccentric I’1] admit, but I’m intrigued as to why anyone would break into a museum to steal Celtic artifacts. Come along, Ace.\nACE: 13, INT. CELTIC GALLERY. DAY.\nPRIDDY: Here you see, or rather you don’t see, what was stolen. This used to house one of the finest selections of Celtic gold in the principality.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Ah, we’re in Wales then.\nPRIDDY: Yes, on the coast. Not far from Swansea.\nPRIDDY: ACE In other words somewhere wild, remote, wet and\nPRIDDY: populated entirely by sheep.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Ace!\nPRIDDY: Not a bad description, actually. We are rather isolated here. I expect that’s why you chose us for your experiments.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Yes, quite. A lot of the gold is still here, though.\nPRIDDY: Yes, only two pieces went. Not the most valuable, but still of enormous scientific value.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Hmm... (He peers at something) This is fascinating.\nACE: It’s just graffiti. Your thieves are just bored kids, I expect. THE DOCTOR Bored kids with a grasp of ancient Celtic runes.\nACE: You what?\nACE: THE DOCTOR These runes are written in a form of Gaelic almost forgotten in this time period.\nPRIDDY: Yes, it’s a runic alphabet that has completely baffled me, Pil admit.\nACE: So the vandals are sophisticated around here.\nACE: THE DOCTOR And they're written in blood.\nACE: Blood?\nPRIDDY: Yes, the police aren’t quite sure what to make of it. I’ve\nPRIDDY: told them about the coven, but they don’t seem to take me very seriously.\nACE: You do surprise me.\nPRIDDY: T'll show you the police report. Won't be a jiffy.\nPRIDDY: Priddy shuffles off.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Honestly, Ace!\nACE: Oh, come on, Professor, our local curator is a Fortean Times junkie with a line on every conspiracy theory going, this coven is probably just the local women’s institute out on a jolly and this theft is just a publicity stunt. There’s nothing going on here!\nACE: 14, INT. CHURCH. DAY. The congregation comes to the end of a hymn - ‘We Plough the Fields and\nACE: Scatter’ would be good. There is much shuffling of hymn sheets and coughing as the VICAR starts his sermon.\nACE: 324\nVICAR: Harvest. A time when we gather in the bounty of the Earth. A time for celebration. But a time when we also remember that man was cast out of the Garden of Eden. Even here in this village, there is sin, hidden deep in the hearts of each of you.\nVICAR: There is a sudden and terrifying rumble. Everything starts to shake. The congregation start to panic.\nVICAR: Judgement is upon us!\nVICAR: Glasses and bottles smash, the rumble is terrifyingly loud.\nGEORGE: What in God’s name?\nMARY: It’s an earthquake!\nGEORGE: Come on, woman. Get out from behind there!\nGEORGE: Bottles start to smash down.\nGEORGE: Display cases rattle (a fire alarm goes off?).\nACE: What's happening, Professor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Feels like an earth tremor.\nACE: ACE In Wales?\nACE: THE DOCTOR If you’ve a better explanation then I... AHH! (He gives a ery of pain)\nACE: Doctor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR It's all right, I'm just... AHH!\nACE: Doctor, what’s wrong?\nPRIDDY: «(Coming back into the room) Well this is turning out to be\nPRIDDY: quite a day for... Good lord, is he all right?\nACE: I don't know. Help me get him to a chair.\nACE: The rumble stops, slowly the glasses and bottles stop rattling.\nMARY: I think it’s stopping.\nGEORGE: Yes. Yes I think you're right.\nMARY: Well now they’re going to have to do something.\nGEORGE: What?\nGEORGE: MARY The government. Oh, come on. George! You’re telling me that that had nothing to do with the plant?\nGEORGE: But surely...\nMARY: We don't know what damage they’re doing out there.\nMARY: I just hope that Hal can get someone to listen to him.\nMARY: A door bursts open.\nCOWLEY: What the hell was that?\nDRAKEFPELL: Ah, Miss Cowley. Nice of you to knock.\nCOWLEY: You're lucky that you still have a door to knock, Drakefell.\nDRAKEFELL: Discourtesy isn’t necessary, Doctor.\nDRAKEFELL: 325\nCOWLEY: I'm sorry, director. I’m a little shaken — literally. What\nCOWLEY: happened? ’ DRAKEFELL A minor earth tremor, an unfortunate side effect.\nCOWLEY: Side effect! We weren’t exactly the most welcome of\nCOWLEY: guests before, now...\nCOWLEY: D Now we will carry on exactly as before, this plant...\nCOWLEY: Is vital to the fuel crisis, I know all that, Director, you can spare ine the propaganda.\nDRAKEFELL: Then can you please let me know if any of our workers were injured during out little... incident.\nCOWLEY: There are no other workers Mr Drakefell. It’s a Sunday, everyone is in bed or in church. It’s just you and me.\nCOWLEY: The hear the babble of the congregation. The rumble fades.\nCOWLEY: VICAR And lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became as black as sackcloth, and the moon became as blood...\nCOWLEY: The rumbling and shaking fades to nothing.\nACE: Get a lot of earthquakes round here, do you?\nPRIDDY: That’s the first to my knowledge.\nPRIDDY: There is 2 groan from the Doctor.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Urgh.\nACE: Hey, he’s coming round. Professor? Are you okay? What happened to you?\nPRIDDY: Here, Doctor. I'll fetch you a glass of water.\nACE: Doctor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR I’m ail right, Ace, I’m all right. How long was I unconscious?\nACE: Only for a couple of seconds, just as long as the earthquake lasted.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes, the earthquake... That’s when it started.\nACE: What started?\nACE: THE DOCTOR An enormous pressure in my mind, the awakening of something... massively powerful - ancient.\nPRIDDY: re-enters the room.\nPRIDDY: Here you are, Doctor.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Thank you, Mr Priddy.\nPRIDDY: He drinks.\nPRIDDY: Poor Algernon hasn't survived very well, I always\nPRIDDY: thought those tusks were too fragile.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR I rather think that damage to a badly stuffed replica Inammoth is going to be the least of your problems, Mr Priddy.\nACE: I was wrong, wasn’t I, Professor? There is something going on here.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Yes, Ace, there is. Something dangerous. I think that I should get back to the TARDIS and run a few tests.\nPRIDDY: TARDIS? Your ship.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Yes. (Mischievously) Would you like to see inside my top\nPRIDDY: 326\nPRIDDY: secret, experimental, government black ops police box?\nPRIDDY: But surely... Official secrets and all that...\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR 0h, I’m sure we can count on you to be discreet.\nPRIDDY: Well, if you think that it would be all right.\nACE: (Accusingly) Professor...\nACE: THE DOCTOR Come along, Ace.\nACE: What do you think caused that tremor?\nACE: THE DOCTOR Well I’m not going to know that until I’ve run my test, am I? Ah, I see what you mean about the mammoth, Mr Priddy. Still, I might have a spare tusk I could let you have...\nACE: The TARDIS key rattles in the lock.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Odd...\nACE: Come on, Professor. THE DOCTOR ‘The door won’t open.\nACE: Have you got the right key?\nACE: THE DOCTOR No, Ace, you don’t understand. It’s the TARDIS. She isn’t letting me in!\nGEORGE: Lord, what a mess.\nMARY: I'm going to phone Hal.\nMARY: She picks up the receiver. Nothing.\nMARY: Dead. (Putting the phone down) Hold the fort here a minute, George.\nGEORGE: Hey, where are you going?\nMARY: (Calling back) The phonebox on the green. I've got a horrible feeling that all the phones are out.\nMARY: The door shuts.\nGEORGE: TH just check that the beers survived then.\nGEORGE: Birdsong, a distant police siren? MARY opens the phonebox door and picks up the phone. Again, nothing. She presses the switch a couple of times.\nMARY: Damn.\nMARY: Something slams into the glass.\nHALTOLLER: (Horribiy loud) The Earth is hungry, all will die!\nMARY: screams.\nACE: But this is daft, Professor. She can't just lock you out.\nPRIDDY: Tm afraid the local locksmith doesn't work Sundays. THE DOCTOR I really don’t think your local locksmith...\nPRIDDY: There is a scream from outside.\nPRIDDY: Good Lord.\nACE: Now what?\nACE: There is another scream.\nACE: THE DOCTOR Come on!\nACE: 327\nACE: THE DOCTOR, ACE and PRIDDY run over.\nPRIDDY: Mary? Mary are you all right?\nMARY: Oh, Mr Priddy, he just came out of nowhere.\nPRIDDY: Good Lord. It’s Hal Toller. What the devil has...\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR He’s been badly mauled, some kind of animal. He’s in shock. Is there somewhere we can take him?\nPRIDDY: MARY The pub. Over here.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Come on. You two give me a hand with him.\nHAL: TOLLER is manhandled inside. He moans weakly.\nGEORGE: What the devil was that screaming about, Mary? Good God.\nMARY: Clear a space for us, George.\nGEORGE: Over here old man, here you go.\nGEORGE: HALTOLLER The Earth... angry.\nMARY: It’s all right, Hal. It’s all right. What’s wrong with him?\nMARY: THE DOCTOR I don't know. Shock certainly, but there's something else. He needs a doctor.\nPRIDDY: But I thought you were a doctor... THE DOCTOR Not a medical Ddoctor Is there one in the village?\nMARY: You're from the plant aren’t you? You’re one of\nMARY: Drakefell’s men. THE DOCTOR Plant?\nMARY: Well, look what your bloody experiments have done...\nACE: Hey, cool it missus!\nACE: THE DOCTOR § I'm afraid that I don’t have the slightest...\nMARY: Oh, don’t you start with al! your hush hush...\nGEORGE: Steady now, Mary. Let’s get Hal sorted.\nMARY: They’ve done enough damage.\nPRIDDY: Oh, don’t be ridiculous, girl, he needs help.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Will someone tell me what this plant is?\nPRIDDY: There’s a new mining and refining installation along the\nPRIDDY: coast, Doctor. Experimental. Caused a fair bit of... friction in the village. THE DOCTOR Then they're bound to have a medical bay!\nMARY: We don’t need them...\nMARY: THE DOCTOR Phone them!\nMARY: T can’t\nPRIDDY: Oh for heavens sake, Mary.\nMARY: No, I mean really, 1 can't. The phones are dead. That’s\nMARY: wy I was checking the phonebox. The earthquake?\nMARY: one DOCTOR Possibly...\nHAL: TOLLER groans again.\nGEORGE: Well we've got to do something. THE DOCTOR This plant. How far is it? GEORGE A mile or so. Look, who the devil are you?\nGEORGE: THE zoezoR There will be time for introductions later. Now, who’s got a car?\nGEORGE: 328\nMARY: Most of the cars in the village are out of action because of this fuel crisis.\nPRIDDY: I could drive you over there, Doctor. My car is still running.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Excellent, Mr Priddy! Ace, go with him.\nPRIDDY: The door swings shut.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Right, you'll need to keep him warm. I don’t think his injuries are life threatening, but I’m worried about infection. Can you get some towels Miss...\nMARY: Reynolds. Mary Reynolds\nMARY: THE DOCTOR We need to try and clean some of these wounds, get some of the earth out.\nMARY: There is the blast of a horn from outside.\nMARY: THE DOCTOR That sounds like my lift.\nMARY: Doctor. ’'m sorry... Thank you.\nMARY: THE DOCTOR I'll be as quick as I can.\nMARY: He exits the pub.\nMARY: The spluttering of an engine.\nACE: It's a real boneshaker, Professor. THE DOCTOR Another exhibit, Mr Priddy?\nPRIDDY: It serves its purpose, Doctor, and in the current fuel crisis\nPRIDDY: it can manage a considerable number of miles to the gallon. Hold tight now. The car roars off.\nPRIDDY: Toller continues to moan.\nMARY: It's all right, Hal. Help is on its way. George, can you give me a hand a moment. George! George?\nMARY: VICAR A doctor, you say.\nGEORGE: Yes, got a girl with him. They’ve headed off to the plant with Priddy. Look, I’ve got to get back. Mary’ll be looking for me.\nVICAR: Thank you George. Perhaps it was a good thing you didn’t\nVICAR: come to church with us this morning, hmm?\nVICAR: The car puttering along.\nPRIDDY: There’s the plant, Doctor, across the bay.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Hmm. They haven’t exactly gone out of their way to make it Dlend in, have they?\nPRIDDY: ACE A right blooming mess if you ask me.\nPRIDDY: PRIDDY The environmentalists are up in arms, and J can’t say I blame them. But Drakefell maintains that it’s the only way to end this fuel crisis quickly.\nPRIDDY: 329\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Drakefell?\nPRIDDY: Edward Drakefell. Company director and the man who discovered this miraculous new fuel source.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR (Thoughtful) Really... Look out!\nPRIDDY: The car screeches off the road. There is a horrible snarl.\nACE: What was it, Professor? THE DOCTOR Something very large and very savage.\nPRIDDY: I'd read all about the sightings of moorland beasts, but\nPRIDDY: I had no idea we had one here.\nACE: Is that what attacked Mr Toller?\nACE: THE DOCTOR More than likely, don’t you think?\nACE: It looked like some kind of dog.\nPRIDDY: Hal Toller had a dog, a Great Dane called Saladin. There is a horrible snarl from nearby.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOH 1 rather think that it's more than just a Great Dane now. I think you should start the car, Mr Priddy.\nPRIDDY: The engine turns over but fails to catch.\nPRIDDY: Tm trying, Doctor, I’m trying.\nPRIDDY: AcE Give it more choke!\nPRIDDY: The snarls get louder.\nPRIDDY: THE DOCTOR Mr Priddy...\nSALADIN: Human scum. All will die...\nSALADIN: The end titles mingle with the howl of the dog."
