(REALISATION) Doctor, I can’t remember!\nDOCTOR: (PLAYING HIS OWN ANXIETY DOWN THROUGHOUT) Try not to worry.\nNYSSA: It’s so dark. I can’t see a thing.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps someone forgot to pay the electricity bill. How do you feel?\nNYSSA: Scared. Like I can’t breathe properly. You?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just stay calm and take this one step at a time, shall we? Take my hand. See if we can’t get up.\nNYSSA: My arms and legs ache.\nDOCTOR: Mine too. Now, this seems to be a rather confined [space] — (STUMBLES ON A PILE OF LOGS) Oww!\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What was that? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Logs.

A wall - you find another and we’1ll soon locate the door. (FORCED CHUCKLE) Either that, or we’ll bash our heads together.\nNYSSA: Doctor... Do you feel it? This terrible sense of [panic —]\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING IN HARSHLY) Nyssa! Please! Focus! (BEAT) I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to raise my voice. Just... breathe deeply. In through the nose, out through the mouth.\nDOCTOR: Better?\nNYSSA: Much. I wish I knew how we got here. I can’t even remember where we are — in time and space, I mean.\nDOCTOR: No, neither can I. But I’m sure the information won’t evade us forever.

It’s nothing, Nyssa. Just a length of rope.\nNYSSA: It’s more than that, Doctor. It’s a noose.\nDOCTOR: Best we don’t dwell. Look - over there.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What is it?\nDOCTOR: A cottage, on what appears to be the edge of a village. Looks rather smart.\nNYSSA: What? With just one floor?\nDOCTOR: Size isn’t everything, Nyssa. Just ask the TARDIS when we relocate it. But perhaps we could shelter there ‘til daylight, when we might be more composed?\nNYSSA: We don’t know who lives inside!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, we have to fight this fear. We seem to be experiencing the same sense of... well, panic.\nNYSSA: So you do feel it.\nDOCTOR: It must be artificially induced. It must.

Have ye the Devil on your tails?\nDOCTOR: I sincerely hope not. I’m the Doctor, this is Nyssa.

What have we got here? My, but your clothes are queer.\nDOCTOR: You live alone, Miss Cobham?\nEMILY: (SAD) I soon will, Sir. Aye... that I will. Can I offer ye some pottage?\nDOCTOR: Most kind.\nNYSSA: Thank you, but I’m afraid I’m not hungry. What did you mean, Emily, when you said — [soon you’1l live alone? ]\nEMILY: I’1ll heat it up. Vegetables to go with it. Ivy and I have lived the life since our mistress passed away, God rest her soul.\nDOCTOR: Oh. You were servants, and now...?\nEMILY: Left her and the master’s cottage to us old maids. Imagine! The locals didn’t like that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 10\nNYSSA: Have you seen the rope outside?\nEMILY: The noose? Aye. Pay it no mind. Been there since Hopkins were around, twenty year back.\nNYSSA: Hopkins?\nDOCTOR: I think Miss Cobham is referring to Matthew Hopkins - am I right?\nEMILY: Aye. The Witchfinder General himself.\nDOCTOR: And I’m now reminded where we are: Suffolk, 1665!\nNYSSA: You were very trusting, to let us in.\nEMILY: Could hardly say no. I saw the fear in your faces.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. We’re stabilising now.\nEMILY: Then why look out the window, eyes so wide?\nDOCTOR: Curiosity.\nNYSSA: We thought we saw.. people, out there, in the mist.\nEMILY: Some say Hopkins and his man John Stearne are still at large in the countryside, eyes full o’ God’s fury. Gliding through the mist in the dead of night, still hunting those with the Devil in their hearts. (BEAT) Sorry, ma’am, did I scare thee?\nNYSSA: s-L’m-just a little cold; that’s. all.\nEMILY: It’s an improbable tale at best. Here, have a blanket round\nEMILY: your shoulders. Stew’s almost done.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: Where’s your friend Ivy tonight?\nEMILY: (DISHING UP) Ivy is my sister, Sir. My twin.

May not last the night.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nEMILY: No need. We’ve lived long in Red Lodge. Fifty year! A miracle for maids like us.\nDOCTOR: Red Lodge! So that’s where we are.\nNYSSA: Is that the name of the cottage?\nDOCTOR: As I recall, Red Lodge is the name of the village. Emily, might I see your sister? There may be something I can do.\nEMILY: Won’t hear of it. (FX: BOWLS ON TABLE) Sit yourselves down, eat. (FX: SCRAPING CHAIRS)\nDOCTOR: Please. It’d be no trouble.\nEMILY: Eat, sir.\nDOCTOR: (FX: HE AND NYSSA SIT) Very well, Emily, but I won’t give up.\nEMILY: Fire’s burning low in the grate.

The fire! Wheels turning, bells ringing. Nyssa, do you remember?\nNYSSA: (SLOWLY) We were talking about fire. We’d just stepped out of the TARDIS, and we were talking about fire!\nDOCTOR: The Great Fire of London to be precise...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: EXT. WOODS (FLASHBACK)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS MATERIALISES. WOODLAND ATMOS, NO WIND. TARDIS DOOR OPENS. )\nDOCTOR: (WALKING OUT) It’s 1665, Nyssa. A whole year yet, before Pudding Lane. Do keep up.\nNYSSA: (FOLLOWING HIM) Do we really have to explore, every time we land somewhere unintended?\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLOSING TARDIS DOOR) He who never explores, Nyssa, will never truly find himself.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Who said that?\nDOCTOR: Me, just then. I think that’s rather good, actually. (BEAT) Look — sunset. Isn’t that worth leaving the old box for?\nNYSSA: If you say so, Doctov...\nNYSSA: (V/O) Doctor, it’s all coming back. As we looked at that\nNYSSA: sunset...\nDOCTOR: (V/O) Yes. We were ambushed.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THICK BUBBLING SOUND AS AMORPHOUS SPEERA-BLOBS SWOOP DOWN TO ATTACK THEM)\nDOCTOR: What was that-?\nNYSSA: AHHHH!\nNYSSA: (V/O) It was all a blur. But something struck the back of my neck...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: (V/O) Something with the texture of warm clay.\nNYSSA: (V/O) And then that terrible hum.\nNYSSA: Doctor! There’s something on me. I can’t move!\nDOCTOR: Me too. Stay calm, Nyssa. Just... stay calm.\nNYSSA: What are they doing, Doctor? Make them stop! Please, make\nNYSSA: stop!\nNYSSA: Page 14\nNYSSA: them\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. COTTAGE — MAIN ROOM\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I can’t remember anything else. Until the woodshed.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) I don’t think I want to. But I’m feeling a little stronger.\nDOCTOR: Whatever happened to us must have induced both the fear and the memory loss, but both are fading. (FX: STANDING UP,\nSCRAPING: CHAIR) Nyssa — take a look at Ivy, would you? Let me know if anything can be done for her.\nNYSSA: Of course. Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: To make sure Emily’s alright with that wood.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT.

Stay away!\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING BED) My name is Nyssa. I’ve come to see if I can help. What is the nature of your illness?\nIVY: “Nyssa”, ma’am? Where might a name like that be from?\nNYSSA: Oh, a long way away.\nIVY: Foreign lands, eh? I never seen ‘em. Never will.\nIVY: NYSSA3: You don’t know that for sure.\nIVY: I always liked the sound of France. But (GENTLE LAUGH) it might as well be the moon. Still, a good life. Yes, good enough for Ivy Cobham. (BEAT) You’ve a kind face, ma’am. Come closer.\nNYSSA: It must be a great comfort that you and Emily are still living together.\nIVY: (CONFUSED) .. What’s that you say, ma’am?\nNYSSA: You and Emily. I just mean: some sisters might have gone their separate ways by now.\nIVY: I.. I don’t know no Emily, ma’am. And I never had a sister.\nNYSSA: But — she’s your twin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 18\nIVY: (ALARMED) My twin? No, ma’am, don’t say that. I thought they were just bad dreams!\nIVY: NYSSA3: What dreams?\nIVY: One of those dreams where you can’t move. And there were demons. Terrible demons: so calm, raking their fingers through my mind...\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) What was that-?\nIVY: Something... someone at the window.\nNYSSA: It’s windy outside, I’m sure it was just a branch.\nIVY: But — but there’s no tree past the glass. (ALARM) Please! No! Stay away from the curtains!\nNYSSA: (STEELING HERSELF) I’ve had enough of being afraid.\nIVY: My nerves can’t take it. Please don’t open ‘em!\nNYSSA: I’m sorry.\nIVY: (GASPS) There is! There’s someone! By all the saints, who is\nIVY: it-?\nNYSSA: (UNNERVED) It’s... it’s me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. COTTAGE — MAIN ROOM\nEMILY: There, sir. Now the fire will last all night.\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) “Improbable”.\nEMILY: I assure ye it will.\nDOCTOR: No, Emily: you called the Hopkins and Stearne ghost stories “improbable”. Where did you learn a word like that? I mean, I find it a touch improbable that you would use it. Not because you lack the intelligence to employ it, but because it sits badly in your mouth. Almost as if someone else was saying it. Someone else, letting themselves slip.\nEMILY: Pardon me, sir?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. IVY’S BEDROOM\nIVY: Ma’am, this is a devil, come to trick us, or worse. She looks\nIVY: all... burned, but she has your eyes.\nNYSSA: No. She’s half me. Almost as if she’s half-developed.\nIVY: Get away from that window, ma’am.\nNYSSA: (TO CLONE NYSSA AT WINDOW) Hello? What do you want?\nIVY: I begs thee, get away!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. COTTAGE — MAIN ROOM\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t pay any attention to me, Emily: perhaps it’s just the paranoia I’ve experienced. But then there’s the small matter of the Plague.\nEMILY: The Plague?\nDOCTOR: It’s rampant in London right now, and spreading further afield. It’s one thing to let strangers in because they sound afraid. Quite another to risk them bringing bubonic plague into your house — wouldn’t you say, ‘Emily’?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. IVY’S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CLOCK TICKS. WIND LOUDER THROUGH BROKEN WINDOW. DOOR OPENS, DOCTOR RUNS IN)\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING SHORT — NYSSA’S NOT THERE) Nyssa?! Nyssa?!\nEMILY: (COLD, CLINICAL) The young woman has been taken.\nDOCTOR: ‘Taken’? Taken where?\nEMILY: To a place where we can feed without interference.\nDOCTOR: I warn you now — if any harm befalls her...\nEMILY: There is no “if”. The probability is one hundred per cent.\nDOCTOR: Probability again. (CHECKING THE BED) I take it this is Ivy? .. Oh. No pulse.\nEMILY: ‘Ivy’ is now an empty vessel. She has served her purpose.\nDOCTOR: This woman wasn’t your twin, was she? She was the original on which you modelled yourself!\nEMILY: Correct. It takes two full charges to duplicate a human.\nDOCTOR: “Charges”? You think of humans as... as batteries?\nEMILY: The first charge allows duplication to begin. Each template must be allowed to recover before we take the second.\nDOCTOR: I assume that’s why we were locked up in the woodshed.\nEMILY: You recovered from the first charge sooner than expected.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: So there are half-formed versions of Nyssa and I walking around out there? Well, this is all very informative, but I have to find the original Nyssa. So if you’1ll excuse me...\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nEMILY: You were incorrect to say that this weapon would be unnecessary.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. RIVER BANK\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SPEERA-ASSIMILATION HUM THROUGHOUT. STREAM RUNS NEARBY,\nWIND: WHISTLES. )\nNYSSA: Please, just let me go.\nCLONE NYSSA: Ninety-eight per cent of your body is now paralysed. Escape is impossible, unless you roll down the bank into the water. I shall not allow this to happen.\nNYSSA: What are you doing to me?\nCLONE NYSSA: Draining you of your life-force. Assimilating your genetic data. Adopting your identity. The first charge gave us your basic body structure.\nNYSSA: And now you’re taking my mind?\nCLONE NYSSA: Correct. Our invasion will require stealth. It is necessary for us to adopt both the outward appearance of humankind, and its internal characteristics.\nNYSSA: And what happens to me after this?\nCLONE NYSSA: Precisely what happened to the human, Ivy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. COTTAGE — MAIN ROOM\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you’1ll pay any mind to the humble suggestion that you pack up and head home?\nEMILY: The Speera will never retreat. Please stand by the fire, where I can see you.\nDOCTOR: Tell me... why did you invent an Emily, when we arrived? I’m guessing you drew upon poor Ivy’s memories — perhaps memories of how she behaved when she had visitors before. But why bother? You could have just paralysed us and got it over with.\nEMILY: Biding time. Controlling you. Waiting for you to recharge. We have discovered that one hundred per cent of humans cannot recharge when immobilized.\nDOCTOR: Remarkably fond of figures, aren’t you.\nEMILY: Numbers yield precision. Precision yields results.\nDOCTOR: Which mean nothing, compared to respecting life.\nEMILY: You respect life in all its forms?\nDOCTOR: I do. Well, unless you happen to have an eye-stalk and a habit of exterminating galaxies.\nEMILY: The Speera do not. This world will be sufficient for us to flourish. Therefore, you must respect us and our intention to assimilate the entire population.\nDOCTOR: Logically, that should be true. In reality, however, I’m going to walk out of the front door. Goodbye.\nEMILY: Stop! I will use this device.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: No. No, you won’t kill me. There’s nothing like death to bring about a one hundred per cent energy loss. And with me dead, you won’t be able to finish the process of...\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED BY HIS CLONE) .. assimilating me. Oh. Hello. My clone-self, I presume?\nCLONE DOCTOR: You are my template. When assimilation is complete, I will be indistinguishable from you.\nDOCTOR: Apart from the fact that I’1ll be dead?\nEMILY: Surrender yourself to The Great Becoming, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Thanks awfully, but I rather think I’1ll resist it instead. Stand aside, Doctor.\nCLONE DOCTOR: Your failure to resist the first charge was precisely one hundred per cent.\nDOCTOR: I have a rule to never be paralysed twice in one day. So I’m\nDOCTOR: afraid I must be off.\nCLONE DOCTOR: This door is the only way out.\nDOCTOR: You’re forgetting the broken window in Ivy’s room.

Your memories.\nNYSSA: I will fight this with everything I have.\nCLONE NYSSA: (CURIOUS) I feel... I feel the sun on my skin.\nCLONE NYSSA: NYSSA3: What?\nCLONE NYSSA: I play in the endless gardens. Warm seasons seem to last forever.\nNYSSA: You’re inside my mind!\nCLONE NYSSA: Sunrise and sunset, my favourite times of day. When my father is home —\nNYSSA: Don’t you dare speak of him!\nCLONE NYSSA: When my father is home, we sit together in the Grove. We watch the sun. I am happy.\nNYSSA: Stop this.\nCLONE NYSSA: I study and achieve. Father’s face, so proud. One day, he disappears forever. So does my world. But now I have a new home, a new [father —]\nNYSSA: Get out of my head!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 28\nCLONE NYSSA: Assimilation seventy-nine per cent complete.\nNYSSA: (WEAK) No...\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Take your hand off her neck and step away.\nCLONE NYSSA: (ALMOST SOUNDING LIKE NYSSA NOW) Doctor, what’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: Don’t be ridiculous — you’re still not fully formed. Anyone can see who the real Nyssa is. Take your hand away.\nCLONE NYSSA: Doctor, you’re scaring me.\nDOCTOR: And you’re underestimating the momentum generated by a well- placed (EFFORT, SHOVING HER) shove.\nCLONE: NYSSAs: Aaaah!\nNYSSA: Good timing.\nDOCTOR: If you say so. It struck me as rather last-minute. Let’s (STRAINING) carry you back to the TARDIS, shall we?\nNYSSA: How deep is the river?\nDOCTOR: One way to find out. (FX: SPLASHES AS DOCTOR RUNS ACROSS KNEE-\nDEEP: RIVER) We need to regroup and find a way to stop the Speera.\nCLONE NYSSA: (RISING OUT OF WATER, OFF) There shall be no escape.\nNYSSA: Doctor! The other me! She’s coming after us!\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Never look back, Nyssa. It’s always worked for me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) There! We can move faster on dry land. Just have to keep going and... (STOPS RUNNING, CRESTFALLEN) Ahhh.\nCLONE VILLAGERS: (ABOVE THEM) Stop. You will stop. You shall not escape.\nCLONE VILLAGERS: You shall not pass. [ETC]\nNYSSA: Doctor, there’s more of them! They’re all around us!\nDOCTOR: Yes. (ALOUD) The villagers of Red Lodge, I presume-?\nEMILY: (STEPPING FORWARD) What made you think you were different from the other ninety-eight per cent of humans in this experimental area? (TO OTHERS) Bring them back to Red Lodge. We shall end this on the village green.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: EXT. VILLAGE GREEN\nDOCTOR: (BEING MARCHED FORWARD) Nyssa, I’m really very sorry about this.\nNYSSA: (DITTO) It’s not your fault, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (DITTO) It’s always my fault.\nEMILY: My brethren! Abandon your positions and gather ‘round. The first stage of the invasion of our new home planet reaches its conclusion.\nCLONE VILLAGERS: The Great Becoming! The Great Becoming! The Great Becoming!\nNYSSA: Please, just let us go.\nEMILY: Death shall be your freedom. Your Speera-twins will now enjoy their final feed, that they may become whole.\nCLONE NYSSA: (ADVANCING) This time, we will not be interrupted.\nNYSSA: Stay back! Please!\nCLONE NYSSA: Assimilating now.\nCLONE DOCTOR: Assimilating now. Soon, I shall access the memory store.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT, BEING DRAINED) So... “experimental area”. This is a test-run? For the full invasion?\nEMILY: Correct. With you and the girl, we now have one hundred human test-conversions.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 31\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Doctor, they still think we’re human.\nDOCTOR: So one of us is the hundredth? Surely we should win a prize. No? Still, it’s all about the taking part.\nEMILY: Silence, fool.\nNYSSA: (ALOUD) The Doctor is definitely more foolish than the average human. Your experimental findings should back that up.\nEMILY: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: (PERPLEXED) Yes, Nyssa, whatever do you mean?\nNYSSA: (ALOUD) Just that the average human lacks extreme failings. Mentally, they are neither too foolish nor too clever for their own good. Physically, neither weak nor muscle-bound.\nDOCTOR: Are you going anywhere in particular with this?\nCLONE DOCTOR: Be quiet. Gaining access to memory store.\nDOCTOR: Kindly stop referring to my brain as a “memory store”.\nNYSSA: (ALOUD) Emily, if you had any kind of worthwhile army, it would replicate the average human paradigm. It would merge the strengths of each gender. Thankfully, that’s beyond your pathetic capability.\nEMILY: How wrong you are. The mighty Speera can utilize its gathered data however it chooses. (TO CROWD) Silence, my brethren.\nEMILY: Let us show them before they die. We shall collate our findings and adopt the statistically average human form.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, why are you helping them?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 32\nNYSSA: Because... my heart’s in the right place. Just like yours.\nEMILY: We shall now transform.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING IT) Ah. Emily, this mightn’t be such a good idea.\nEMILY: Spare us your reverse psychology, Doctor. Your friend’s loose tongue will aid our triumph over humanity.\nDOCTOR: It really won’t. Please, there’s still a chance —\nEMILY: That is enough!\nCLONE DOCTOR: I am inside the Doctor’s memory store. Wait. There is something [wrong] -\nEMILY: Cease assimilation, both of you! (FX: SPEERA TRANSFORMATION-\nHUM: STOPS.) Their minds can wait - we have their bodies. (TO\nHUM: CROWD) The rest of you — link hands! Reassimilate! Regress to the human mean!\nEMILY: (VOICE DIFFERENT, QUITE ALIEN) You see, Doctor? Look now upon the Earth’s new human race. Genderless and statistically optimized.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Emily, if you’d only gone home like a good Speera...\nDOCTOR: 98 CLONE EMILYS:\nEMILY: (EXPERIENCING SUDDEN PAIN) What is this? This... pain? In my chest?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 33\nNYSSA: In all your chests. The Doctor has two hearts, but you’ve counted him as one person. One hundred and one divided by one hundred, means that you each have an extra point-one of a heart.\nDOCTOR: That, and a whole variety of other, non-human glitches in your new biology...\nEMILY: What?!\nDOCTOR: . all of which adds up to a series of fatal anomalies, I’m afraid.\nEMILY: We must transform again!\nOTHER EMILYS: Insufficient time to re-energise. I cannot breathe.\nOTHER EMILYS: Help us! Please!!!\nOTHER EMILYS: (FX: WIDESPREAD AGONISED MOANING, AMONG THE SPEERA CLONES,\nUNTIL: END OF SCENE)\nEMILY: (DYING) This... cannot be happening.

VILLAGE GREEN (LATER)\nNYSSA: I just wriggled my fingers, I’m sure of it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the paralysis is wearing off.\nNYSSA: I have that terrible ‘dread’ feeling again.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but this time, we know why we feel it. The biggest fear lies in not knowing why you’re afraid.\nNYSSA: Finally, some daylight! Feels like it’s been dark forever. Look — you can see the horizon.\nDOCTOR: I might appreciate it more if we weren’t surrounded by the dissolving residue of Speera.\nNYSSA: Doctor, they would have killed us without a second thought. You should be grateful they’ve gone.\nDOCTOR: I take no pleasure from winning a battle in this way, Nyssa. Gratitude for the death of others soon chews through the soul. However, I must admit that your idea was technically inspired. You knew the Speera would be meticulous with their calculations.\nNYSSA: I’m glad they weren’t meticulous enough to notice that you have two hearts. Or that neither of us was from Earth.\nDOCTOR: The Speera saw the human brain as a box of facts, paying no attention to the connective tissue which truly makes someone alive. It’s unsurprising that they might overlook matters of heart and home. Right! Time to (STRAINS) sit up. Yes, that’s the stuff. Now — time to locate the TARDIS.\nNYSSA: Doctor? Can we stay here a minute longer? To see the full sunrise? (BEAT) Please?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DEMONS OF RED LODGE by Jason Arnopp (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR: Yes, if you'd like to. Of course. (SITS BACK DOWN) Is — is everything alright?\nNYSSA: It’s just that — for some time now, I haven’t really allowed myself to think about Traken. About my father. But the Speera in my mind brought everything back.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nNYSSA: They were good memories, Doctor. Happy memories. They haven’t been so happy in a long time.\nDOCTOR: Well, things always brighten. Given time.\nNYSSA: Yes. (BEAT) Look at all that golden sunlight, coming up over the horizon. It’s so very beautiful.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I suppose it is. And when you think about it, there’s no hurry, is there?

So?\nDOCTOR: Read the plaque.\nNYSSA: I still don’t [see what’s so] .. (SURPRISE) Oh.\nDOCTOR: ‘Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole’. Chamber music by Kremmisus, court composer to the inaugural consul of the Traken Union. Lots of lutes. Can’t say I care much for lutes...\nNYSSA: My father loved this piece. He used to play it for my stepmother, when she was low. However did you know?\nDOCTOR: I.. well, I just thought...\nNYSSA: You knew I’d been thinking about Traken. You came here for me. And you so wanted to see that Horizon before it folded.\nDOCTOR: Well, we can always go another day.\nNYSSA: Not quite the same, is it, when it’s not live? Now you’re going to sit through a whole Traken geometrical sonata instead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 4\nDOCTOR: Actually, I was thinking I might have a wander around while you listen. Traken was in many ways a wise and admirable culture.

Cataloguing downloads. Just goes to show [that —]\nDOCTOR: Yes. Jolly interesting. What was that noise?\nNALOOM: (REFOCUSED) There was a girl. She released it. Now it’s spreading through the collection... destroying so many priceless harmonies...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 5\nNYSSA: What is it? An aural virus?\nDOCTOR: Every sound’s viral, when you think about it. Expanding outwards, transferring vibration from particle to particle. Except...\nNYSSA: Except for what?\nDOCTOR: Well, except for primal sonics. But they’re just a theory.\nNALOOM: I’ve seen that terrible sound rend flesh and bone.

Can I access the datacore from here?\nNALOOM: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: This shouldn’t take long.\nNALOOM: (TO NYSSA) What’s he doing?\nNYSSA: He’s tracing the infection. Back to its source.\nDOCTOR: Here it is, ground zero. One single recording within the collection. ‘White Waves, Soft Haze’, composed on Earth in the late nineteen-sixties by one Geoff Cooper. Genre: Progressive rock.\nNYSSA: 3: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Again, not really my thing.\nNALOOM: If I may elaborate...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 6\nDOCTOR: Please do.\nNALOOM: (ENCYCLOPAEDIC) Geoffrey Belvedere Cooper, born 1941, was a reclusive guitarist working in the progressive rock field. Known to aficionados as ‘The Coop’, his quartet achieved notoriety on the club circuit through a short composition entitled ‘You Can See My Pad, Doll’. Which I believe was banned by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Would you like to hear Die\nNYSSA: Yes please.\nDOCTOR: Absolutely not.\nNALOOM: Suit yourself. (SNIFFS) After a brief solo career, Mr Cooper vanished without trace before completing his final composition — a psychedelic suite entitled ‘White Waves, Soft Haze.’ Never released.\nNYSSA: That’s impressive.\nNALOOM: I am an archivist, young lady.

The country estate of Geoffrey Cooper, rock icon.\nNYSSA: Nice place.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLOSING DOOR) Do you think so? It seems a little ostentatious for only one man.\nNYSSA: This from a homeowner who doesn’t even know how many rooms he’s got.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Quiet, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) The rich like their privacy.\nDOCTOR: They like their isolation. (STOPPING) But this isn’t quiet like tranquillity. It’s quiet like death. No birds. No animals. Just the breeze...\nMRS MOLONEY: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Hey! You two! What do you want?\nNYSSA: And a rather angry-looking woman.\nDOCTOR: She’s coming over. Let me handle this...\nNYSSA: Be my guest.\nMRS MOLONEY: (ARRIVING) This is private land. Didn’t you see the signs? Although I suppose you pair are used to breaking into places you’ve no right to be. Look at you, in your King’s Road rags and your... your... Is that a vegetable you’re wearing?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 9\nDOCTOR: It’s decorative. We’re here to see Mr Cooper. Perhaps you could let him know we’ve arrived? We’re.. friends of his. Musicians!\nMRS MOLONEY: You don’t fool me, sonny. None of his musician friends call him ‘Mr Cooper’. It’s all ‘cat’ this, and ‘dude’ that. Now, if you don’t scarper, I’m calling the [police.]\nNYSSA: (CUTTING IN, UNCHARACTERISTICALLY BRASSY) He’s not a musician. Just wishes he was.\nMRS MOLONEY: And who might you be?\nNYSSA: Met The Coop in a club. Asked me back to see his pad, he did. (GETTING HER TEETH INTO THE ROLE) Couldn’t shake this cat once I’d told him. The Coop’s his idol.\nMRS MOLONEY: Oh, I see. You’re a groupie.\nNYSSA: (BACK TO NORMAL) What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Never mind. (TO MRS M.) So, can we see him then? The Coop?\nMRS MOLONEY: He’s in his studio. Not to be disturbed.\nDOCTOR: Well, we’ll just ‘hang out’ here til he’s free, if that’s alright.\nNYSSA: If The Coop don’t like it, he can tell us to scarper himself — right, doll?\nMRS MOLONEY: Doll?!? (BEAT) Oh, suit yourselves. You stay in the kitchen, mind, where I can keep an eye on you. (FX: SHE TRAMPS OFF, ACROSS THE GRAVEL.) I’1l tell you this. though, I don’t approve.

Mr Cooper dotes on him. (SIGHS) Ain’t seen him since yesterday, mind. It’s a big estate, but still — it’s not like Abaddon to miss his food, not like him at al1l..\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) No birds... no dog...\nMRS MOLONEY: Mind you, his master’s the same. I’m supposed to be his cook, but he hasn’t eaten a proper meal in weeks. Marmite and biscuits, that’s all he’1ll touch. I’m neither use nor ornament these days. He’s in that studio all of the time, day and night. Ever since he met [that girl...]\nNYSSA: (CUTTING IN) What do you make of his music, Mrs M?\nMRS MOLONEY: Oh, his old stuff’s not so bad. When he was with the band. All that banging’s not really my cup o’ tea, but I suppose it’s alright for you young ‘uns.\nDOCTOR: I, uh, prefer his more recent material. Have you heard his latest? ‘White Waves, Soft Haze’?\nMRS MOLONEY: Is that what it’s called? Silly bloomin’ name. No, he hasn’t let me hear it. Hasn’t let anyone hear it, ‘cept that girl...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 12\nNYSSA: What girl?\nMRS MOLONEY: Elissa. Erissa. Something foreign.

She was there, inside the music.\nNYSSA: 3: You knew her name.\nDOCTOR: Not her name, her race. Erisi. Entropy Sirens.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY COMPOSITION by Rick Briggs (004) Page 19\nNYSSA: Then you’ve met them before?\nDOCTOR: Of course not. No one has. The Entropy Sirens can’t live in our reality, not since the first stars formed. They disappeared.\nNYSSA: Now one of them is back.\nDOCTOR: Without chaos to feed on, she knew she’d die. So she found Geoff Cooper. She became his muse. Directed him to compose ‘White Waves, Soft Haze’, then infiltrated a copy into Concordum’s vaults.\nNYSSA: The archivist, Naloom. He said something about a girl...\nDOCTOR: In time, all of Concordum will be infected.

She had Geoff Cooper compose ‘White Waves, Soft Haze’ here on Earth in 1968.

JANSON AND PETE’S SINGING IS TREACLY. )\nDOCTOR WHO: JANSON/HOBBLING PETE:\nDOCTOR WHO: (LESS THAN HALF NORMAL SPEED) Oh, when the saints go marching in/Oh, when the saints go marching in/Lord, how I want to be in that number/When the saints go marching in!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. PRISON YARD (CONTINUOUS)\nGOVERNOR: (TO CAMERA) It’s new technology. Personal time is literally slowed down inside the forcefield. One minute’s walk takes a week’s life off you. (FX: BLEEP, INTO COMMS) Field gate, we have a breach. Two prisoners in the time field. Go and collect them. No hurry. (BACK TO CAMERA) Obviously, the prisoners will suffer some ill-effects. Exhaustion. Dehydration. Starvation. But that’s a small price to pay for security. And when I’m your President, —\nDOCTOR: (MARCHING UP FROM OFF, FURIOUS) Governor Chaplin! Would you care to tell the people at home how it was you purposefully choreographed that disgraceful display?\nGOVERNOR: Guards — take Dr Smith to Solitary.\nDOCTOR: You might also want to warn them about the explosion! The explosion that’s going to devastate this — oof! (BREAKS OFF,\nCLOBBERED: BY GUARDS. DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH: )\nGOVERNOR: As I was saying: When I’m your President, the colony borders will be protected by the same defences. Simple, effective, strong.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT\nDASK: (ENTERING) Prisoner Smith will stand!\nDOCTOR: (STANDING) Dask. If this is another cell inspection, I can assure you there’s absolutely no [need —]\nGOVERNOR: (ENTERING) Good afternoon, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Governor Chaplin. I confess I’ve lost track of time, rather, which is a new and not very pleasant experience. But isn’t my parole hearing long overdue?\nGOVERNOR: This is your parole hearing, Doctor. Dask — wait outside.\nDASK: Ma’am. (FX: EXITS, CLOSING DOOR)\nDOCTOR: Now. About this time field of yours. —\nGOVERNOR: Yes, the time field. You’1ll be pleased to hear that I’ve made a few alterations.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) Good. Good!\nGOVERNOR: It no longer takes a week of your life to cross it. It takes a year.\nDOCTOR: A year-?!? Stretching a time field that thin — you know, that’s terribly dangerous.\nGOVERNOR: Is it. (BEAT) I take it you still claim there’s going to be some sort of explosion here?\nDOCTOR: You’ve got six months. Start planning an evacuation, please.\nGOVERNOR: Election’s in six months. I’1l be busy.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: Once again, you’re not listening — (BREAKS OFF) “Doctor”. You called me “Doctor”. Just “Doctor”.\nGOVERNOR: Well, you’re not the infamous ‘Dr John Smith’, are you?\nDOCTOR: At last!\nGOVERNOR: Dr John Smith doesn’t exist. It’s a catch-all name for every unidentified criminal offender on Folly. So when you turned up here, claiming to be that very man —\nDOCTOR: I didn’t stand a chance. Yes, I see that now.\nGOVERNOR: I’m here to offer you a deal, Doctor. I can have you released tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: Good. What’s the catch?\nGOVERNOR: I don’t know why, but — people listen to you, Doctor. The guards, the prisoners, the kitchen staff — they like you. I can’t seem to make them like me.\nDOCTOR: I can’t imagine why.\nGOVERNOR: It’s the same with my campaign. People want me to clean up this Colony, I know they do. It’s just they start getting squeamish when I tell them how it needs to be done. But you, Doctor — you’ve got the common touch. You know what is that people need to hear. You know how to win their confidence.\nDOCTOR: Are you offering me a job?\nGOVERNOR: In a purely unofficial capacity, of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: (THINKS) In which case — might I be placed in charge of evacuating the prison, shortly before noon on the morning of May the tenth?\nGOVERNOR: Not this again. You don’t see it, do you, Doctor? I believe you.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nGOVERNOR: So I’ve decided this “explosion” of yours can be my big election day stunt.\nDOCTOR: Whaat?! ?\nGOVERNOR: Disaster at the prison. Terrible casualties. And me in the middle of it all, bravely battling on. Restoring discipline, punishing the guilty.\nDOCTOR: But — this is madness!\nGOVERNOR: On the contrary. It’s a clincher. (FX: BANGING ON DOOR) Guard! Guard!!! (FX: AS DASK UNLOCKS DOOR FROM OUTSIDE...) Right now, I\nGOVERNOR: only make the rules in the prison, but soon I’1l1 make them for the whole planet. The whole system.\nDOCTOR: Should I applaud now?\nGOVERNOR: Parole refused. Six months’ solitary. (EXITING CELL) Lock him up, Dask. (FX: WALKS OFF.)\nDOCTOR: You heard her, Dask.\nDASK: Doctor, I — (STEPPING IN, CONFIDENTIALLY) .. I’ve a message from Janson. He’s just back from the university hospital. Wants me to warn you that someone called Michael is “foxy”?\nDOCTOR: “Foxy”?\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 26\nDASK: Says you want to be careful, Doctor. They never wait.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Close the door behind you, Dask.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM\nDASK: (ALOUD) Alright, you know the drill. Visitors will not touch the prisoners. No items may be passed either way. No whispering.\nDASK: No squealing either, Jabreth!\nNYSSA: (TO DASK) He’s bored, poor thing. He knows he shouldn’t have played truant, but it was quadruple maths, he didn’t think anyone would notice.\nDASK: What?\nJANSON: (OFF, HISSED) Nyssa! Over here!\nNYSSA: (FX: WALKING UP, SCRAPE OF CHAIR) Janson, where’s the Doctor?\nJANSON: Aren’t you pleased to see me?\nNYSSA: Yes, yes of course. It’s just that — I need to see him.\nJANSON: Yeah, well — he’s still in solitary. Four months now, it’s a record. We’re running a book on how long the Governor’11 keep him in there.\nNYSSA: Is he alright?\nJANSON: I guess. He’s singing a lot. Most days you can hear him from the exercise yard. We’ve been playing cricket, like he taught us — you know, to keep his spirits up. Keep on telling Jabreth, swallowing the ball and regurgitating it doesn’t count as a catch.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 28\nNYSSA: Oh, yes. Cricket. Do you have — (TRYING TO REMEMBER THE WORD) “bails”?\nJANSON: (ANNOYED) If I had bail, do you think I’d still be in here? (CHANGING SUBJECT) Sorry. Let’s talk about you instead.\nNYSSA: I'd rather not.\nJANSON: Michael, right? Is all not well in paradise?\nNYSSA: The wedding was very elaborate.\nJANSON: Oh!\nNYSSA: Yes, they seem very happy together.\nJANSON: Ah.\nNYSSA: Still, I finish at the hospital in a few weeks’ time.\nJANSON: Listen, Nyssa — I won’t be in here forever. And when I get out... I could use a partner who’s smart.\nNYSSA: ‘Partner’?!?\nJANSON: What do you say? Your brains, my beauty — we could be the next Bonnie & Clyde!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: EXT. PRISON YARD\nJANSON: Doctor! You’re — whoa, I’ve got you, I’ve got you.\nDOCTOR: Thanks, Janson. Just a little shaky on my legs. What’s all this?\nJANSON: You’re a hero, Doctor. Longest single term in Folly’s solitary ever recorded. Even the guards have come out into the yard.\nJANSON: (ALOUD) Everybody! The Doctor’s not used to the daylight or you lot shouting, so let’s just calm it down, now.\nDOCTOR: What day is it? Janson?\nJANSON: Err, Monday. Spare the lags a few words, yeah? There’ll be a riot if you [don’t —]\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, later. The date, Janson!\nJANSON: Well - tenth of May, Doctor. Election day!\nDOCTOR: Oh no!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE\nNYSSA: Please, Governor Chaplin. I still don’t understand exactly why it is I’ve been arrested.\nGOVERNOR: I have the details here... (FX: STOPS) Ah, yes. Nyssa Traken. Remanded without bail, on charges of criminal conspiracy.\nNYSSA: What conspiracy?!?\nGOVERNOR: Allow me to explain. It’s prison policy to record all visits, just to ensure nothing untoward is going on.\nNYSSA: But I’ve done nothing untoward!\nGOVERNOR: The fifteenth of March recording says otherwise. (ALOUD) Computer: play.\nJANSON: (DISTORTED) /Listen,] Nyssa — I won’t be in here forever. And when I get out... I could use a partner who’s smart.\nNYSSA: (D) ‘Partner’?!?\nJANSON: (D) What do you say? Your brains, my beauty — we could be the next Bonnie & Clyde!\nGOVERNOR: Computer — stop. Compelling evidence, don’t you think?\nNYSSA: I don’t know this Bonnie and Clyde!\nGOVERNOR: (ALOUD) Guard!\nDASK: (ENTERING) Ma’am — (BEAT) Nyssa. You finally did it.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 31\nNYSSA: So it seems. At least I get to see the Doctor.\nGOVERNOR: Not if I send you to H Block. Dask, we’re taking this prisoner down.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21: EXT. PRISON YARD\nJANSON: Come on, Doctor, say something!\nDOCTOR: I have to get out of here.\nJANSON: Tell me something I don’t know!\nDOCTOR: But first — Janson. We need to get everyone as close to the prison perimeter as possible, just in case.\nJANSON: In case of what-?\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD, TO ALL) Hello. It’s nice to be back in the yard. I’m seeing — what is it, one thousand seven hundred and nine prisoners? And seventeen guards?\nJANSON: You counted-?\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) Yes, I think that’s right. Everyone, we’re going to play cricket. Eight hundred and sixty-eight-a-side cricket. Everyone to my left, you’re Australia. Everyone to my right, you’re England. (CLAPS HANDS) Come on — form up!\nGOVERNOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Enjoying yourself, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Governor Chaplin. I’m going to ask you one last time — evacuate the prison, [before —] (BREAKS OFF) Nyssa?!?\nNYSSA: Hello, Doctor. I thought I couldn’t get arrested around here, but it seems I was wrong.\nGOVERNOR: Well — enjoy your association time, you two. I’m afraid I’m due at my count.\nDOCTOR: Please. We have to talk!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 33\nGOVERNOR: Oh, Doctor, you should know by now — I’m not about speeches, I’m about action. Dask — escort me to the field gate.\nDASK: Ma’am.\nNYSSA: It’s almost noon, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know. I wish I knew exactly what it is she’s planning. A bomb of some kind, perhaps-?\nNYSSA: You don’t think it’s possible you’re mistaken? About the explosion?\nJABRETH: (BEGINS SQUEALING EXCITEDLY, POINTING AT THE SKY. HE’S ACTUALLY SAYING, “LOOK, MY MUM’S COMING!”)\nDOCTOR: I saw the temporal trace, it was perfectly clear.\nNYSSA: What’s that noise?\nJANSON: It’s only Jabreth.\nNYSSA: No, not that. Up in the sky. Engines!\nJANSON: Yeah, Jabreth’s done his time. His folks are coming to collect him.\nDOCTOR: But — that’s it!\nNYSSA: You mean — the Jabreths are going to attack the prison?\nDOCTOR: I daresay that’s what Governor Chaplin is hoping everyone will think! Jabreth starship engines use elliptical warp drive technology.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 34\nNYSSA: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Perfectly safe, under normal circumstances. But in a time field, the warp engines will go into spasm, and... well, boom.\nNYSSA: And Chaplin knows this?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see, Nyssa? I gave her all the information she needed. She’d have observed months ago that the explosion I detected coincided exactly with the scheduled time of arrival of Jabreth’s parents. All she had to do was put two and two together. I even told her how long to stretch out the time field for!\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Jabreth. I’ve got a plan.\nJANSON: You’re going to break out of jail?\nNYSSA: In approximately three and a half minutes?\nDOCTOR: On the contrary. I’ve got a year. (STARTS RUNNING) After me,\nDOCTOR: everyone!\nNYSSA: You heard him, Janson, Jabreth. (RUNNING) Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: EXT. BESIDE MAIN GATE (CONTINUOUS)\nGOVERNOR: (INTO COMMS) Field gate? Lower the forcefields, I’m coming through.\nDASK: That ship, Governor... It’s flying very low.\nGOVERNOR: Is it. (INTO COMMS) Field gate? What’s taking you?\nDASK: Forcefields down, Ma’am.\nGOVERNOR: Escort me, Dask.\nGOVERNOR: (FX: THEY WALK ON. BEAT. DOCTOR, NYSSA, JANSON & JABRETH COME\nRUNNING: UP)\nDOCTOR: (TO HALT) There she goes. Nyssa — wish me luck. I have to get into the time field before the electrified barrier powers up again.\nNYSSA: Doctor, you can’t cross the time field.\nJANSON: It’ll take a year of your life.\nDOCTOR: Blink of an eye. To a Time Lord.\nNYSSA: It won’t work. You’1ll need a year’s supply of food and water. And that’s something we don’t have right now!\nDOCTOR: No. Well, I’1ll just have to risk it. —\nJANSON: Hold on, hold on. Jabreth?\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 36\nJANSON: Yeah, I know. But if there was ever a time to cough up, it’s now.\nNYSSA: What’s he doing?\nJANSON: Regurgitating.\nDOCTOR: What?\nJABRETH: (FX: .. REGURGITATES A BELLYFUL OF CONTRABAND ITEMS, CLATTERING ONTO THE FLOOR. CANS OF POP. CHOCOLATE BARS. MAGAZINES)\nDOCTOR: Good heavens.\nJANSON: There you go, Doctor. Fill your pockets. (PICKING UP ITEMS) We got cans of fizzy pop. We got chocolate bars. Don’t suppose you’1ll need the magazines...\nNYSSA: Yes, but what was all that doing in Jabreth’s stomach?\nDOCTOR: (FILLING POCKETS) Contraband. No wonder Dask’s cell inspections never turned up anything illicit.\nJANSON: Yeah. Turns out there’s an upside to having an alien on the wing.\nNYSSA: Doctor — Chaplin’s on the other side!\nDOCTOR: This’ll have to do. Thank you, Jabreth. (RUNNING, CALLING BACK) Nyssa, Janson — keep everyone on the edge of the [yard!]\nDOCTOR: (FX: SWALLOWED UP BY THE SOUND OF THE FORCEFIELD COMING BACK ON. )\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 37\nNYSSA: Good luck, Doctor.\nJANSON: The ship’s getting closer. (BEAT) Nyssa — what is a Time Lord, exactly?\nJANSON: SCENE 23: INT. FOLLY FORCEFIELD (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: (SLOW) Focus, Doctor. Steady pace at bat. That’s the trick.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: EXT. FIELD GATE\nDASK: That ship’s really low.\nGOVERNOR: You’re right, Dask. I should do something. (FX: STATIC CRACKLE) (INTO COMMS) Jabreth ship, welcome to Folly. This is Gov - (SHRUGS) - President Chaplain. You’re cleared to land.\nDASK: Land?! ?\nGOVERNOR: (INTO COMMS) Time field distortion? No, no — not to worry, it’s normal on Folly.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: EXT. BESIDE MAIN GATE (CONTINUOUS)\nJANSON: What’s keeping him?\nNYSSA: Hurry, Doctor...\nNYSSA: SCENE 26: INT. FOLLY FORCEFIELD (CONTINUOUS)\nNYSSA: (SLOW, BEHIND FORCEFIELD) .. Hurry!\nDOCTOR: (SLOW) I am hurrying!\nDOCTOR: Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: EXT. FIELD GATE\nDASK: (CLUTCHING EARS) That sound-!!!\nGOVERNOR: (SHOUTING OVER NOISE) Camera crews?!? Where are my camera crews-?!? (BEAT) There! Look at that! An alien attack craft! We’re under alien attack! This — this is what I warned you about, Folly! Now it’s really happening! All of you at home — if you’ve not made it out to vote, I urge you — go now, for the sake of our Colony! (FX: FORCEFIELD HUM CUTS OUT. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE ENGINES BEGIN TO SHIFT TO A NORMAL TEMPO. ) Go! Go! Go-!!!\nDASK: It’s gone. The noise. It’s gone!\nGOVERNOR: What? (INTO COMMS) Field gate, raise the forcefields! Field gate, come in please!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: EXT. BESIDE MAIN GATE (CONTINUOUS)\nJABRETH: NYSSA3: The forcefields are down! He made it!!!\nJANSON: Yeah. (LOUD AS HE CAN) Everyone — the forcefields are down!\nNYSSA: Janson, no-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: EXT. FIELD GATE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SOUNDS OF CHEERING PRISONERS CHARGING THROUGH THE GATES BEHIND, EN MASSE)\nGOVERNOR: The prisoners! They’re breaking out! Dask — shoot them!\nDASK: What, all one thousand seven hundred and nine of them?!?\nPRISONERS: (OFF) There’s Chaplin!/Get her!!!\nGOVERNOR: Just — protect me!\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Governor Chaplin! In here! Hurry!\nGOVERNOR: Doctor-?!?\nDASK: What’s he doing in Field Gate Control?\nDOCTOR: No time to debate! In here! Now!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. FIELD GATE CONTROL (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: Quick! .. (FX: CHAPLIN AND DASK RUSH IN) Dask, hold the door!\nGOVERNOR: (BREATHLESS) Doctor. It was you. You powered down the forcefields!\nDOCTOR: It was.\nGOVERNOR: But you were on the other side of the time field. I saw you — (DOUBLE-TAKE) When did you grow that beard?\nDOCTOR: No time to explain. Governor — stand over there, please. In the far corner.\nPRISONERS: (OUTSIDE) Chaplin’s in there!/Get her! Tear her legs off!/And her arms!/Yeah, and her head! [ETC]\nDASK: I can’t hold the door, Doctor! You’1ll have to talk to them!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think they’re in any mood to listen, Dask. But I have another solution in mind...\nGOVERNOR: Whatever it is — do it, Doctor! Do [it!!!]\nDOCTOR: As you say, Governor.\nDASK: The time field! It’s in here!\nDOCTOR: I’ve narrowed it, to around Governor Chaplin. A nice, secure, week-wide exclusion zone around her own personal borders.\nDASK: You did that?\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR: It is rather basic time technology.\nJANSON: Doctor? You here?!?\nDOCTOR: Janson. And Nyssa, there you are.\nNYSSA: We can’t hold them back, Doctor.\nJANSON: You’re going to have to give her up. The Governor.\nDOCTOR: Tell the crowd, they’re welcome to try. But, as you see — she’s spending a little time in Solitary.\nJANSON: The time field. Huh. That’s smart. (CALLING) Alright, everyone, there’s no getting at Chaplin. Not unless you want even more time inside!\nJANSON: Reckon I should do the same.\nDASK: Err, not so sure about that.\nJANSON: C’mon, Dask. It’s not like I won’t be back soon enough.\nNYSSA: Please, Nathan.\nDASK: - Alright, “chen.\nDOCTOR: Janson. You could always go straight, you know.\nJANSON: I’1ll think about it. Honest. (EXITING) Bye, all.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOING TIME by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Nyssa — we should be off, as well.\nNYSSA: You’re not leaving her here. Chaplin.\nDOCTOR: She'll be out of the time field in a week, she’1ll survive.\nNYSSA: But she’s a tyrant!\nDOCTOR: A tyrant who’s gambled her entire reputation on security, but appears to have let one thousand, seven hundred and nine prisoners loose on the streets of Folly. I think her poll ratings may just have taken a bit of a blow. Not to mention her chances of keeping her job.\nNYSSA: And the escaped prisoners?\nDASK: Yeah, some of them might actually have been guilty!\nDOCTOR: Well, I only hope some of them will have listened to my advice.\nNYSSA: Then there’s the temporal trace. The explosion that never happened?\nDOCTOR: An echo isn’t the same as an event. Besides, the explosion could never have happened if I hadn’t detected it, and warned the Governor about it. A paradox!\nNYSSA: Yes, well — I don’t suppose the Time Lords will take such a relaxed view.\nDASK: There'll be an enquiry. What do I do? What do I say?\nDOCTOR: Look here, both of you. If anyone asks, just tell them the notorious criminal Dr John Smith was responsible. I gather that’s how it usually goes, here on Folly...\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 1\nDOCTOR WHO: 4: SPECIAL FEATURES\nDOCTOR WHO: A ONE-PART ADVENTURE BY JOHN DORNEY\nTHE DOCTOR: PETER DAVISON Time traveller.\nTHE DOCTOR: NYSSA/’FELICITY’: SARAH SUTTON Time traveller’s companion./Character played by Nyssa in the film The Devil’s Whisper.\nMARTIN ASHCROFT: Director of the film The Devil’s Whisper.\nSIR: JACK MERRIVALE/ ‘PROFESSOR BROMLEY’ / ‘NARRATOR’ : Actor aged 65./Character played by Merrivale at age 40 in the film The Devil’s Whisper./Narrator of The Devil’s Whisper.\nJOHANNA: BOURKE/ ‘CARLOTTA’ : Actress aged 55./Character played by Bourke at age 30 in the film The Devil’s Whisper.\nALSO: MR PINFIELD; YOKEL; RUNNING MAN; CARRIAGE DRIVER.\nDIRECTOR: KEN BENTLEY\nSCRIPT EDITOR: ALAN BARNES\nPRODUCER: DAVID RICHARDSON\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: NICHOLAS BRIGGS & JASON HAIGH-ELLERY\nBIG: FINISH PRODUCTIONS LTD © 2010\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 2\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 1: INT. RECORDING STUDIO\nASHCROFT: Hello, and welcome to this twenty-fifth anniversary DVD. My name’s Martin Ashcroft, and I directed ‘Doctor Demonic’s Tales of Terror’. With me is —\nMERRIVALE: Sir Jack Merrivale, actor.\nBOURKE: And I’m Johanna Bourke, hello. I played Carlotta in ‘The Devil’s Whisper’, the first of the stories in the film.\nASHCROFT: (ASIDE, TO DOCTOR) Um, can you say your [name-]?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, sorry. I’m Doctor John Smith, historical advisor on ‘The Devil’s Whisper’.\nASHCROFT: Great, that’s all of us. So, welcome to the commentary, here we go.\nASHCROFT: Opening titles here, as you can see. Designed by the legendary Paul Mundell, of course. Dead now, sadly.\nBOURKE: Lovely man.\nASHCROFT: Lovely man, yes, absolutely. Lovely man. Much missed.\nASHCROFT: So, Sir Jack — a lot of people probably won’t realise that was you as Doctor Demonic in the opening scene...\nMERRIVALE: No, no, they probably won’t.\nASHCROFT: Lot of make-up there.\nMERRIVALE: Yes, lot of make-up. Lot of make-up. The idea was that I played a different character in each of the four stories...\nASHCROFT: Which you did brilliantly.\nMERRIVALE: Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 3\nASHCROFT: Unrecognisable every time.\nMERRIVALE: Of course, and that linked in with the whole ‘devil as storyteller’ thing at the end.\nBOURKE: Can we give away the end?\nASHCROFT: We can, yes. Yes, we can.\nASHCROFT: Lovely Laura Price there on props. Such a shame. Some of you may have heard of the so-called ‘Curse of the Devils Whisper’... (BEAT) Actually, it’s not really appropriate to go into that now. Tragic, though. Tragic.\nASHCROFT: Our enigmatic writer Phillip Mongston there.\nASHCROFT: Ah, Jerome.\nBOURKE: Yes. Quite the ladies’ man, our producer.\nASHCROFT: Supposed to be here with us today, of course, Jerome. But we’re recording this a month too late. Hope there are barmaids in heaven.\nMERRIVALE: Are you just going to talk about who’s dead?\nASHCROFT: Yes, so here we go. ‘Doctor Demonic’ was a portmanteau film — basically one big movie made up of several shorter ones. Very popular in the Seventies. Mainly horror. Sometimes comedy. Or indeed comedy horror. Usually horror, though.\nASHCROFT: So now we’re into the first part of the film, ‘The Devil’s Whisper.’\nBOURKE: (To MERRIVALE) Oh, don’t you look young, Sir Jack.\nMERRIVALE: It was a long time ago. We all looked younger.\nASHCROFT: Yes. (BEAT) Except you, Doctor Smith, you don’t look a day older.\nDOCTOR: Don’t I?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney\nBOURKE: No, you don’t.\nASHCROFT: I mean — literally, not a day.\nDOCTOR: Well, I am a Doctor.\nASHCROFT: I see. Yes.\nBOURKE: We must talk later.\nBOURKE: Page 4\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 5\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 2: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nBOURKE: (SEEING NYSSA ON SCREEN) Oh! That’s, um...\nASHCROFT: . Nyssa, Nyssa Traken.\nBOURKE: Nyssa Traken, yes.\nASHCROFT: Only did the one film. European, I think.\nBOURKE: Maybe she went back?\nASHCROFT: Said she was from — from ‘Tardis’, I think it was.\nBOURKE: Tardis, where’s that?\nMERRIVALE: Romania.\nBOURKE: Right.\nASHCROFT: Good little actress. Good little actress. Wonder what happened to her?\nASHCROFT: Yes, so, nineteen seventy-six we made this.\nBOURKE: The long summer, wasn’t it?\nASHCROFT: Actually filmed in Beachamwell itself, it’s a real village. Real village in Norfolk.\nMERRIVALE: Lovely village. Lived in the area many years. Beautiful part of the country.\nASHCROFT: It’s based on a genuine, er, legend. Lots of funny legends from the area.\nMERRIVALE: Yes, like ‘the mystery of Red Lodge’. (SNORTS)\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 6\nASHCROFT: Do you want to tell us anything about that, John?\nDOCTOR: About the mystery of Red Lodge?\nASHCROFT: About Beachamwell.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes. Well, the story goes that in the mid-nineteenth century a landlady who’d recently lost her husband in an accident —\nBOURKE: (INTERRUPTING) That’s me. My character.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The story goes that she turned to spiritualism for comfort, but that during the course of her explorations she was possessed by demons, demons that used her as a conduit for the possession of others. Most of the village was taken over and the number of victims grew exponentially.\nMERRIVALE: So then what happened?\nDOCTOR: Well, the possessions ended when a visiting professor, and his niece —\nBOURKE: (SEEING MERRIVALE ON SCREEN) Oh, that’s you.\nDOCTOR: That’s.. Sir Jack, yes. He, and his niece, reversed the possession and drove the demons away, rescuing all the villagers. (BEAT) And that’s basically it.\nMERRIVALE: Nonsense.\nDOCTOR: Well, it is a legend.\nASHCROFT: So how much of that is actual historical fact, then?\nDOCTOR: Fact is difficult to define, isn’t it?\nASHCROFT: You must have some idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 7\nDOCTOR: I do, but —\nMERRIVALE: How much?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) All of it.\nMERRIVALE: What?\nDOCTOR: Obviously, there’s been some corruption in the telling.\nMERRIVALE: Are you suggesting demons are real?\nDOCTOR: Not as such, no.\nASHCROFT: Then this landlady was, what - mentally unstable?\nBOURKE: (LAUGHING) Explains why I was cast!\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. It’s complicated.\nMERRIVALE: Well, since none of us were there at the time, it’s all rather academic, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 8\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 3: INT.

Probably shouldn’t have mentioned it, really.\nASHCROFT: Building up to the first of the big sacrifice scenes, now. Some of the props and costumes in this sequence are totally authentic. They’re from Beachamwell itself. They’re supposed to have taken part in the actual events.\nASHCROFT: That plate, shield thing, whatever it is.. The circular wotsit with all the odd symbols on it. That’s authentic. (BEAT) Actually, it’s not, is it? The original was authentic, but this is the reshoot...\nMERRIVALE: We’re not going to talk about that, are we?\nASHCROFT: Well, we’ve got to, it’s famous.\nMERRIVALE: I’ve worked on a great number of films over the years. There are always problems.\nASHCROFT: Quite severe problems, Jack.\nMERRIVALE: Just because it’s a horror movie, people start bandying around the word ‘curse’ willy-nilly...\nASHCROFT: It’s sort of understandable, given all the... accidents. And, you know, Laura.\nBOURKE: I thought we weren’t going to talk about her.\nMERRIVALE: What happened with Laura was tragic, yes, but not supernatural. There was nothing otherworldly going on.\nASHCROFT: The missing scene, explain that! (BEAT) The first sacrifice sequence was a reshoot from a day when an entire night’s filming vanished. All the props, script pages, footage. Gone. We were shooting the possession scene you’ve just, er, seen. We were doing Sir Jack’s coverage later. We’d been going an hour or so, just getting ready to hit the whole chanting bit and then — (BEAT) Then, it’s a blank. Don’t know what happened. Suddenly it’s three hours later and everything’s gone. No-one remembered a thing.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 9\nBOURKE: I think it was aliens.\nMERRIVALE: Good grief.\nASHCROFT: There’ve been various tests over the years. Investigations. None of them turned up what happened. Just another one of those unsolved mysteries.\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) So, Sir Jack wasn’t on set...?\nASHCROFT: No.\nASHCROFT: fas\nBOURKE: That’s a nice dress.\nBOURKE: Lax\nASHCROFT: Big action sequence coming up here. The runaway carriage bit. Always a tricky thing to film, action.\nASHCROFT: Obviously, for the most part I let Matt, our second unit director, do the exteriors, the carriage going through the wood.\nMERRIVALE: Most of it was in studio, though.\nASHCROFT: Yes. We used a technique called back projection, so we could integrate the footage from the studio with the scenes shot outside.\nASHCROFT: You see, that’s the studio. You and Nyssa. The view through the window’s back projection.\nASHCROFT: That’s on film.\nASHCROFT: Studio again.\nBOURKE: How are you getting the rocking motion?\nMERRIVALE: Stage hands. Moving a rig.\nASHCROFT: And that’s back on location.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: Gareth Hampton our stunt driver there. Lovely man. Went to his wedding the other week. Lovely service.\nBOURKE: You often did action sequences, didn’t you, Sir Jack?\nMERRIVALE: When required. One of the things with doing a lot of horror films. Lots of action. Lots of make-up.\nASHCROFT: Sir Jack, and indeed Johanna, were already on board when I joined the project. Have to say, I couldn’t have been happier.\nBOURKE: Oh, thank you.\nASHCROFT: There’s a real weight you gain from actors of quality, and iconic actors... even more so. A sort of history. A dignity. A — (BREAKING OFF) Oh, and you’re just about to go in the mud here.\nASHCROFT: There you go. Six takes that was.\nMERRIVALE: Seven.\nASHCROFT: Was it?\nMERRIVALE: Yes.\nASHCROFT: Right.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 11\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 4: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nASHCROFT: (WATCHING CARRIAGE GO OVER CLIFF) That was at the seaside at Southwold, that precipice.\nMERRIVALE: Lovely town. Know it well.\nMERRIVALE: [..]\nASHCROFT: Not the best dialogue in the world, has to be said. Fairly functional. Did any of you ever meet the writer? Phillip Mongston?\nBOURKE: Um. Don’t remember.\nMERRIVALE: No.\nASHCROFT: I didn’t. Bit of a recluse by all accounts.\nASHCROFT: Odd choice. The script. Jerome brought it along at the last minute. Very keen. Don’t know why. Quite insistent. I’m happy with the end result, obviously -\nBOURKE: Yes, it’s good, isn’t it.\nASHCROFT: Very good, but still — odd choice. Odd choice. Plot doesn’t really make sense. We’d planned on making a few changes but our script supervisor had a bit of an accident, bit late in the day. Had to go as written.\nASHCROFT: [..]\nBOURKE: She’s very good, isn’t she?\nASHCROFT: Nyssa Traken?\nBOURKE: Yes.\nASHCROFT: Very good. Very good. Does so much with just the face. I mean, look at the fear there. So real.\nASHCROFT: Felicity was originally going to be played by Amelia Pacquola from.. from somewhere in Europe.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 12\nMERRIVALE: Handsome woman. Wonderful knitter.\nASHCROFT: (NONPLUSSED) But anyway, she left the project about a week before the shoot. Think it was a week. She’d been offered a film in Australia.\nDOCTOR: (AWKWARD) Ah.\nASHCROFT: Big part, big money. Couldn’t say no. Turned out to be made up. Absolute hoax, didn’t exist. Someone just faked it, got her to fly out for no reason. By the time she found out, we’d already started with Nyssa.\nASHCROFT: Who was something of a lucky find, has to be said. The day we heard from Amelia, Nyssa had had an appointment in a different office in the same building, can’t remember what for, and just stumbled into the wrong office. By mistake. Jerome liked the look of her, got her to read... and a star was born.\nASHCROFT: Actually, no, obviously, because she only did the one film, but you know what I mean.\nASHCROFT: Never found out who made the hoax, incidentally, the hoax film. Never found out. Always wondered.\nMERRIVALE: Are you all right, Dr Smith?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes, yes, I'm perfectly fine. It’s just the chair, it’s a little... pointy.\nASHCROFT: Anything you want to add? Been a bit quiet.\nDOCTOR: No, no, you carry on, you’re doing marvellously.\nASHCROFT: You do sort of need to speak, otherwise there’s not a massive amount of point you being here...\nDOCTOR: I’m just thinking.\nBOURKE: What about?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 13\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. The curse, as a matter of fact.\nMERRIVALE: Oh, no.\nASHCROFT: You missed most of it, didn’t you? You weren’t on set ‘til late in the shoot. All that had stopped by the time you arrived.\nDOCTOR: A little after I arrived, technically.\nASHCROFT: Actually, you turning up. That was strange. No-one could remember hiring you.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, you see -\nASHCROFT: Like you’d just walked in off the street. In fact... I don’t remember you being hired for this commentary.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you?\nASHCROFT: They said there was only enough money for three, wasn’t there?\nDOCTOR: I’m very cheap. (BEAT) What did you say?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 14\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 5: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nASHCROFT: Again, this was the actual pub the landlady was supposed to have run.\nDOCTOR: So I was right. It isn’t dead.\nASHCROFT: What? What isn’t dead?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) The Rasht Nursemaid. I knew it was too easy.\nMERRIVALE: What are you on about?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid that two of you are in very great danger indeed.\nASHCROFT: What?\nBOURKE: Two of us? Which two?\nDOCTOR: What happened to Jerome? Precisely?\nASHCROFT: Are you feeling alright?\nDOCTOR: You said he died a month ago, how did he die?\nASHCROFT: I don’t know if this is really appropriate —\nDOCTOR: Answer me!\nASHCROFT: In his sleep?\nDOCTOR: Why? He wasn’t old.\nASHCROFT: Um, no-one’s exactly sure —\nBOURKE: Are we still going?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 15\nASHCROFT: He just sort of — stopped.\nDOCTOR: Stopped?\nASHCROFT: Yes.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Does that remind you of anyone, hmm? Does that sound familiar at all?\nMERRIVALE: (REFUSING TO BELIEVE) No.\nBOURKE: (ANSWERING THE QUESTION) No.\nDOCTOR: Does it, Martin?\nASHCROFT: (QUIETLY) Yes.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nASHCROFT: (BEAT) Laura Price.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Laura Price on props. Twenty-three years old. Died during the night, when her body just stopped for no readily apparent reason. No-one could ever figure out why.\nASHCROFT: It’s not the same thing.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it? Or has the curse come back?\nMERRIVALE: There is no curse.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but there is a cause. The absence of supernatural influences doesn’t mean everything’s totally unconnected. There was only enough money for three people today, you said?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 16\nASHCROFT: So they told me.\nDOCTOR: But Jerome was supposed to be here as well, wasn’t he? If he hadn’t died.\nASHCROFT: Yes, but I don’t see what —\nDOCTOR: So it’s simple maths, Martin. One of you is his replacement.\nASHCROFT: What?\nDOCTOR: But which one?\nBOURKE: I've been booked for months.\nASHCROFT: I’ve always been doing this.\nMERRIVALE: (OFFENDED) I’m Sir Jack Merrivale.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, you were hardly going to admit it, were you?\nMERRIVALE: What are you on about? Admit what?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) One of you killed Jerome so you could be here today. Just like you killed Laura.\nASHCROFT: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 17\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 6: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nMERRIVALE: I’ve had enough of this. (OFF MIC) Over there, in the booth. Can we start again, please? Can we start this again, just the three of us?\nDOCTOR: If you start this again without me, then two of you will be dead within thirty minutes.\nMERRIVALE: What?\nDOCTOR: With me, you’ve got less than five. If I don’t stop it.\nMERRIVALE: I’m calling the police. (FX: BEGINS PRESSING NUMBERS INTO\nPHONE: )\nDOCTOR: (SNATCHING PHONE AWAY) No, I don’t think so —\nMERRIVALE: But - that’s my phone! You give me back my phone!\nDOCTOR: You want to live, you will listen to me. (TO JOHANNA) What if I were to tell you, Miss Bourke, that you were right?\nBOURKE: I was right?\nASHCROFT: About what?\nDOCTOR: About what was responsible for the missing scene.\nMERRIVALE: Aliens?\nBOURKE: I’m never right.\nDOCTOR: Not aliens. One alien. One very nasty alien.\nMERRIVALE: Are you insane?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 18\nDOCTOR: In the eighteen-hundreds. On the film set, in 1976. And here today. The same one. Every time. Martin — you wanted to know what affected the landlady, if it wasn’t demons?\nASHCROFT: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: It was a Rasht. A particularly nasty kind of mind parasite from another dimension.\nASHCROFT: I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: An energy being. More of a concept than a physical reality.\nMERRIVALE: This is ridiculous!\nDOCTOR: They send out seeding devices through space, like dandelions in the wind. Looking for somewhere to land, to fertilise. Round discs covered in symbols.\nASHCROFT: Like the prop in the ceremony?\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Martin, that’s right, exactly like the prop in the ceremony. (BEAT) Sooner or later these devices find life. They’re picked up in space, or land on inhabited planets. Whatever. They find it. Or more accurately, it finds them. Before too long, some poor unfortunate locates one of these devices and touches it.\nASHCROFT: And... erm... then what?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) It plants a seed in their mind — a lone embryonic Rasht that’s lived in the device in suspended animation for perhaps hundreds of years.\nASHCROFT: I think I’ve gone mad.\nDOCTOR: It grows. And as it grows, it envelops and devours the host’s mind, eating it away as nourishment, gaining strength as it dies.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 19\nMERRIVALE: That’s revolting.\nDOCTOR: Slowly, bit by bit, it takes over the host body, possessing it entirely, becoming one. And then its purpose becomes to act as nursemaid, birthing new Rasht in new minds. That’s what all this is about.\nASHCROFT: It is?\nDOCTOR: It’s happened twice before. And it’1ll happen again today if I don? 't:stop 2.\nASHCROFT: The landlady?\nDOCTOR: Her husband was killed when the device fell from the sky. She must have been infected straight away.\nASHCROFT: And then possessed the other villagers?\nDOCTOR: Rasht technology operates through the combination of images and the spoken word. If a control phrase is said while someone looks at the symbols on the seeding device a tunnel opens up in their mind and a Rasht embryo floods in. That’s how they propagate. That’s what the ceremony was.\nASHCROFT: (NERVOUSLY) Which we then repeated?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. And I mean, precisely.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 20\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 7: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nDOCTOR: The first time it happened this... visiting professor was able to force the Rasht out of the villagers’ minds. The Nursemaid retreated into the seed device, where it must have remained untouched for over a century, lost somewhere in the wilds of Norfolk. I couldn’t find it at the time.\nASHCROFT: You couldn’t?\nDOCTOR: Er.. he. (BEAT) Then, in nineteen seventy-six, someone found it. Someone new. Someone involved with the movies. They were possessed.\nASHCROFT: And they put it in the film? In my film?\nDOCTOR: What better way to disseminate their race into as many people as possible? Film the device, speak the control phrase over the footage, distribute it nationally — you’ve got thousands of Rasht waiting to be born. (BEAT) I’d thought it was Jerome. He made sense. He’d insisted on all the authentic locations, the props. He’d even provided the script.\nMERRIVALE: But, the writer —\nDOCTOR: Phillip Mongston doesn’t exist. I checked. It’s a pseudonym.\nASHCROFT: No wonder I never met him.\nDOCTOR: Anyone who got in the way of using the real device and control phrase was dealt with.\nMERRIVALE: Laura.\nDOCTOR: Laura, yes, and the script supervisor. All those other accidents. It couldn’t have anyone changing things before filming began, could it? (BEAT) So on the night you filmed the ceremony the words were said while you looked at the device — and all of you were possessed by Rasht.\nMERRIVALE: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 21\nASHCROFT: There’s one in my mind?\nDOCTOR: Not any more. I was able to drive them out. Your real minds returned, but obviously you had no memory of the events.\nMERRIVALE: (BEMUSED) Obviously.\nDOCTOR: I destroyed the footage.\nASHCROFT: You did?\nDOCTOR: The footage, the seeding device, the script pages, the soundtrack. Anything to ensure the scene couldn’t be replicated, even accidentally.\nASHCROFT: And — the nursemaid?\nDOCTOR: I thought it was dead. I was sure it was dead. Jerome seemed fine. I thought it had left him.\nASHCROFT: But it wasn’t in Jerome?\nDOCTOR: No. I see that now.\nMERRIVALE: But if the footage was destroyed and the device was destroyed, why are you here? Today?\nDOCTOR: Because I overlooked something.\nMERRIVALE: What?\nDOCTOR: The final scene.\nASHCROFT: The second ceremony?\nDOCTOR: Chronologically later, but filmed earlier.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 22\nASHCROFT: Ah, yes, we shot that one first because during production we realised that —\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING IN) I don’t think we really need to know that at the moment, Martin! (BEAT) It had footage of the seeding device. I forgot. I left it in. Say the control phrase over the final scene, and you possess anyone who listens. You can’t do it on the soundtrack any more. But you can do it - on a commentary. I’d thought it was dead. But what if I was wrong? What if it had just retreated, licking its wounds, reviving its strength? What if it realised it had one last chance to spread its spores across the planet? (BEAT) I had to be here. Just to see. It seems like I made the right choice.\nASHCROFT: So, what are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Do? Same as before. I’ve studied Rasht technology, their language. Just as the right control phrase can birth one of their young, so another can burn an adult from our plane completely.\nASHCROFT: Well, then, say it!\nDOCTOR: It destroys human minds too, Martin. I can only say it to the nursemaid, otherwise I kill the innocent.\nASHCROFT: Then you’d better find out which one of us it is. It’s on screen in a minute or two, we’ve not got much time!\nDOCTOR: It’s not that easy!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 23\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 8: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nDOCTOR: It has to be someone who could have influenced Jerome into planting the props and buying the script. Someone with power over him.\nMERRIVALE: Like Martin? He’s the director, he’s all power!\nDOCTOR: Or the star? Someone who could insist on script approval? Someone who’d lived in the area all his life, and could have easily have found the seeding device?\nASHCROFT: Jack! You mean Jack!\nMERRIVALE: Sir Jack!\nDOCTOR: Everything points to one of you two. You’re the only ones who had the power.\nASHCROFT: Wha- But it’s not me!\nMERRIVALE: Or me! I’ve got a BAFTA and everything!\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFUL, AS HE FIGURES IT OUT) But that’s just it, isn’t it? You’re too powerful. Too important. The director and the star. Why wouldn’t you have been booked for the commentary?\nASHCROFT: Um -\nDOCTOR: So maybe it’s a different sort of power. Maybe Jerome was held in a different way.\nASHCROFT: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) ‘Quite the ladies’ man, our producer.’\nBOURKE: Why are you looking at me like that?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 24\nDOCTOR: You’ve been remarkably quiet the last few minutes, Miss Bourke. Did none of that make you want to ask a question?\nBOURKE: I couldn’t follow a word of it, sweetie.\nDOCTOR: It has to be you. You’re the only person who could possibly be a replacement for Jerome.\nBOURKE: Now that’s just rude.\nDOCTOR: You found the device. It took your mind. You wrote a script about the events in Beachamwell —\nBOURKE: I can barely string two words together!\nDOCTOR: You’ve been hiding from me all along. Pretending to be meek and quiet and inoffensive, not saying anything that might draw attention to yourself, anything relevant. I mean, would anyone really talk such inane nonsense all the time?\nBOURKE: Not heard many DVD commentaries, have you?\nDOCTOR: You seduced Jerome. You got him to put your script in the film, the real props in the film. And just to make certain, you cast yourself in the part. What better way to guarantee the phrase will be said, than by saying it yourself?\nBOURKE: You are a very strange man.\nDOCTOR: The game’s up, I’m afraid. Martin, Sir Jack. Cover your ears. (CHANTS) ‘Drakshula maktinsha!’\nBOURKE: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: A new control phrase. One that can destroy you. ‘Drakshula maktinsha —’\nBOURKE: This is mad.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 25\nDOCTOR: ‘Alancra miktelsha —’\nBOURKE: (TO MERRIVALE AND ASHCROFT) Are you just going to sit there?\nDOCTOR: ‘Sambrala tenshula fallancha eltanbla!’\nASHCROFT: Careful!\nBOURKE: (POSSESSED. LOUD AND SHOUTING) You dare use our language against us?\nMERRIVALE: Good grief!\nASHCROFT: Jo, Jo are you all right?\nBOURKE: Quiet, worm!\nMERRIVALE: This can’t be happening!\nDOCTOR: ‘Drakshula maktinsha! Alancra miktelsha!’\nBOURKE: Keep talking, Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: ‘Sambrala tenshula fallancha eltanbla!’\nASHCROFT: It’s not doing anything!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 26\nCOMMENTARY: SCENE 9: INT. RECORDING STUDIO (CONT)\nBOURKE: The words are useless without the pictograms! Another miscalculation, Doctor.\nASHCROFT: What?\nDOCTOR: I think perhaps we could be in trouble.\nBOURKE: Trouble? In one minute, Rasht larvae will enter your brain — and your entire consciousnesses will be food for our young, no trouble!\nMERRIVALE: I need to call my agent.\nDOCTOR: (TO BOURKE) You can’t be planning on continuing this insane scheme? Who in their right mind would keep listening after this?\nBOURKE: You’re still listening. You’re still here. I can seed the three of you.\nASHCROFT: No!\nBOURKE: Then we start the commentary again. And next time, we’ll get it. right.\nMERRIVALE: Listen here, you. I’m Sir Jack Merrivale!\nBOURKE: Will you shut up, you pompous microbe?! That I have had to sit through twenty minutes of your pointless posturing -\nMERRIVALE: How dare you?\nBOURKE: I said SHUT UP!\nBOURKE: (FX: SMASHES HIM TO THE FLOOR. OVER THE NEXT FEW LINES HE MOANS IN AGONY )\nDOCTOR WHO: SPECIAL FEATURES by John Dorney (002) Page 27\nDOCTOR: There was no need for that!\nBOURKE: If my people did not have a use for his flesh, ‘Jack’ would be dead.\nASHCROFT: (PANICKED, SHOUTING) Please! In the booth, whoever you are, phone the police —\nBOURKE: Do you not understand? Nobody is getting in here, nobody is getting out! Your soul is mine. Your life is mine. Look at the screen!\nDOCTOR: Don’t do it, Martin!\nBOURKE: LOOK AT IT!\nASHCROFT: I — I must... must look...\nBOURKE: You too, Doctor. Look at the screen.\nDOCTOR: I -\nBOURKE: You have not the will to resist, look at the screen.\nBOURKE: Twice before you have stopped me. It will not happen a third.\nBOURKE: Feel it.
