She’s not been the same since Terminus...\nTURLOUGH: (CLEARS THROAT) Yes, well. We’ve already spent two days and nights recalibrating the systems.\nDOCTOR: The problem’s persisting, I’m afraid. Can’t have parts of the TARDIS being left behind each time we take off. I’m going to have to try reformatting the interior dimensions.\nTURLOUGH: How long will that take?\nDOCTOR: As soon as you leave the TARDIS I can get started and find out.\nTURLOUGH: I.. I’d sooner stay and help.\nDOCTOR: And if you could, I’d take full advantage. But a procedure like this requires the TARDIS to be free of all organic life — save for the operator.\nTURLOUGH: Can’t I operate it for you?\nDOCTOR: You’re not a Time Lord.

(URGENT) D’you see the man over there? The balding man at the bar in the black leather. The only one standing.\nTURLOUGH: I’d imagine a jumpsuit that tight makes it hard to sit anywhere.\nDEELA: He’s called Kanch. At least he hasn’t seen us. Can’t see Hoss, though...\nTURLOUGH: What’s he look like?\nDEELA: She. They’re mercenaries. They’ve had me locked up for days in their spaceship, picking up scans, losing them, just waiting ‘til you showed up.

DEELA’S VOICE WHEN IT COMES IS SYNTHETICALLY DISGUISED TO SOUND MORE MASCULINE)\nRENNOL: Rennol.\nRENNOL: DEELA [SYNTHETIC VOICE]: All done.\nRENNOL: Hoss and Kanch pulled it off?\nRENNOL: DEELA [SYNTHETIC VOICE]: Just as planned. How could Turlough resist his darling Deela?\nRENNOL: I’ll prepare for his unhappy homecoming.\nRENNOL: DEELA [SYNTHETIC VOICE]: Do that. And have something cold and sparkling ready for when all this is over. Won’t be long now.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 22\nNYSSA: It’s over. They’ve gone.\nDOCTOR: Is everyone alright? Tegan?\nTEGAN: I didn’t think that shaking was ever going to stop.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the stresses on the hull from those blast jets...\nDOCTOR: Well, this ship ought to be able to withstand the force of planetary re-entry. But yes, we must find out if we’re spaceworthy.\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR STARTS ACTIVATING CONTROLS. SWITCHES, BEEPS AND BLOOPS AS ENGINES WARM UP)\nTEGAN: By asking the flight computer?\nDOCTOR: No. By taking off ourselves and seeing if we manage to pull through the atmosphere.\nTEGAN: Wish I hadn’t asked.\nDOCTOR: (STILL WORKING) We can’t delay. Turlough’s abductors already have a head start — I imagine they’1ll be in starwarp by now.\nNYSSA: Then how will we follow them?\nDOCTOR: Think about it, Nyssa. A star-warp — all that superheated plasma pushed out into space...\nNYSSA: Leaving a disturbance in the background radiation.\nTEGAN: A trail!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Unfortunately, this is a mining ship, not exactly built for speed... In this particular race, I’m afraid we’re the tortoise and Turlough’s captors are the hare. Unless...\nTEGAN: I don’t like the sound of that ‘unless’.\nDOCTOR: (FURY OF FLICKING SWITCHES) We need more power. This ship is\nDOCTOR: designed to hollow out asteroids. In zero gravity, harvesting minerals sheared from the rock can be messy, yes? Everything\nDOCTOR: floating about in the void.\nNYSSA: So.. it carries a local gravity field to weigh down the local environment where necessary?\nDOCTOR: Gravity wells, powered by the engines. Precisely. Now, if we could rechannel that power back into the engines...\nTEGAN: We’d go faster?\nNYSSA: Or the engines would explode.\nDOCTOR: We have to take that chance. I’11 make the modifications in orbit I think — first we’d better take off from this spaceport.\nTEGAN: Why? It’ll be crawling with security types, officials, space police any moment. People trying to help.\nDOCTOR: If we wait, we’ll lose the trail. And we can’t afford a delay. Turlough’s abductors are killers. He should be safe while they need him. But once their aims are achieved...\nNYSSA: You’d better get to work.\nNYSSA: (FX: WE HEAR THE DOCTOR PRESSING THE BUTTONS AND RESPONSIVE RUSH FROM ENGINES )\nDOCTOR: Drive systems on line. (FX: BLEEP) There! And with any luck the automatic pilot will...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA/TEGAN:\nDOCTOR: . take us up. Strap yourselves in, you two. This could get a little — bumpy!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 25\nTURLOUGH: (COMING ROUND) Oh... my head.\nDEELA: Vizz? Oh, thank Trion.\nTURLOUGH: Deela?\nDEELA: Here. Drink this. It should make you feel better.\nTURLOUGH: I couldn’t feel much worse. (DRINKS) Where are we? What happened?\nDEELA: Hoss and Kanch happened. We’re in the hold of their ship.\nTURLOUGH: Who are they?\nDEELA: They’re working for a man named Rennol. He kidnapped me weeks ago.\nTURLOLUGH: Weeks?! ?\nDEELA: I’ve been tranquilised for most of it. Then your DNA-trace was picked up on Vektris, and Hoss and Kanch took me there. They waited days trying to get a proper fix on you...\nTURLOUGH: And when I came out of the TARDIS they got it. (SIGHS) What do these people want with me?\nDEELA: That’s my Vizz.. Only caring about himself.\nTURLOUGH: Should I care about you, after all that happened?\nDEELA: It’s not my fault your family group chose the wrong side in the war.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 26\nTURLOUGH: Proving my point. We never cared what was right or wrong in the old days, did we?\nDEELA: Only what was right for us. (PAUSE) I never imagined the two of us would ever be alone together again. Did you?\nTURLOUGH: (SOFTER) It’s a far cry from our Bubble, isn’t it?\nDEELA: Oh, Vizz. Back then you were the only thing that made sense in my life. Now... you’re the only thing that can save it.\nTURLOUGH: What are you talking about?\nDEELA: Rennol knows about our Bubble. That’s why he needs us. Both of us.\nTURLOUGH: But how could he know—?\nDEELA: He stole things from my father — documents, papers.\nTURLOUGH: (UNEASY) But why would this Rennol even care? (BEAT) I take it we’re on our way to the winter planet right now?\nDEELA: Yes. Rennol’s waiting for us in the palace.\nTURLOUGH: Home, sweet home.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 27\nKANCH: Coming out of star-warp.. now.\nHOSS: And there’s Planet Turlough.\nKANCH: Call that a planet?\nHOSS: There’s over a hundred rocks that size in this system, Kanch. Most of them owned by well-off Trions as stellar retreats, then abandoned at the start of the war. (BEAT) Rennol’s signal came from here?\nKANCH: Yeah. And he’s got a life-sign damper in the atmosphere so it looks like a dead world — keep the Trion Repatriation Squads away. Plus the palace has its own covered landing bay, so the ships won’t show on any orbital scans.\nHOSS: Very thorough. What about that tap I put on his personal comms? You’ve been monitoring?\nKANCH: He’s only used it to talk to us. Course, he might have another comms. Private, like...\nHOSS: He might. (BEAT) Well, take us down.\nKANCH: It’s Rennol we should take down. This job’s dragged on for weeks.\nHOSS: We’ve taken care of business in the downtime.\nKANCH: Local debt collecting? (SNORTS) Fact remains you couldn’t buy an old maid on Domo for what he paid us up front for our services. If you work out the daily rate...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 28\nHOSS: It will be worth it. If you could only read as well as you moan, you’d be able to study Rennol’s stolen papers.\nKANCH: He says he nicked them from Deela’s old man, but...\nHOSS: They are genuine. The computer date-checked.\nKANCH: Yeah, yeah, ‘priceless treasure’, something old, unique, blah blah. But why not say what it is?\nHOSS: Doesn’t want it public knowledge, I suppose. In times of war, civilian assets are often confiscated. (IRRITABLY) You’d rather I didn’t take the gamble? You want to be a mercenary grunt your whole life? Or do you want to make a real killing for a change?\nKANCH: You really think this could be the big one?\nHOSS: If it isn’t, I’1l let you get straight back to the killing you prefer. Rennol, Deela, the boy — they’1l be all yours.\nKANCH: Taking her down.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 29\nTURLOUGH: All right, Deela. We’re landing, they’1ll be coming for us. Once we’re in the Palace, we can try to get away to the hidden door, then into the catacombs...\nDEELA: Vizz, if we try to run they’1ll shoot us down. They only need our lips, remember?\nTURLOUGH: I do remember. (BEAT) But if we could hide out in the palace catacombs, give them the slip, then double back and steal their spaceship...\nDEELA: Always the dreamer, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: You used to dream, too, Deela. What happened to make you stop?\nHOSS: All right, you two. Rennol’s waiting. On your feet.\nKANCH: We’re off to your fancy palace.\nTURLOUGH: It’s not mine. It was sequestered by Deela’s father when the war broke.\nDEELA: He secured it, Vizz. Protected it from looters. Better it at least stayed in the family than got wrecked.\nHOSS: Family? You two related then?\nTURLOUGH: Not by blood.\nDEELA: We belong to the same clan.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 30\nTURLOUGH: Belonged. Your father tried to have me removed permanently the first chance he got. I was lucky to get away with exile. If he protected this place, Deela, he had his own reasons — nothing to do with family.\nKANCH: Oi! Spare us. Her old man might be no expert in removal. But we are.\nHOSS: So don’t try anything — either of you. We’re going to meet Rennol in the Great Hall.\nKANCH: And since it’s your gaffe, ginger — you can lead the way.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: There! We’ll try that... (FX: CONSOLE EXPLODES IN SPARKS) Or... something else.\nTEGAN: How much longer is this going to take?\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s constructing a whole new operating system for the engines, Tegan.\nDOCTOR: After working on the TARDIS these last few days, it’s a little like giving up four-dimensional chess for a game of conkers.\nDOCTOR: Luckily, I’ve always been rather good at conkers.\nTEGAN: It’s worked?\nDOCTOR: You sound surprised.\nNYSSA: (FX: PRESSING SCANNER CONTROLS) Now the scanners are back online, I have a likely course vector for Turlough’s abductors.

Use the keyboard to your left...\nTEGAN: (FX: BLEEPS IN TIME) Zero... three... seven...\nDOCTOR: Press the blue button there and let’s.. (FX: ENGINES ACCELERATE WILDLY AS TEGAN HITS ENTER) Follow that spacecraft!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP.

Nice drawings on the walls...\nHOSS: (WALKING) They’re called paintings, Kanch.\nKANCH: (WALKING) All of that, yeah. (STOPS) This palace is an auction waiting to happen, Hoss. We’1ll need another ship to fit everything in. What about it, Ginger — you’1l help us load up, right?\nDEELA: Don’t rise to the bait, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: I thought you wanted to reach the Great Hall?\nHOSS: Good point. Keep moving.\nDEELA: (WALKING) I didn’t think I’d ever see this place again, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) I’ve been trying to get home, fooling myself I could be happy if I could only make it back. That I could belong. But...\nKANCH: (TO STOP) But no-one cares.\nHOSS: Is the Great Hall through here?\nTURLOUGH: Yes. The doors are Majorican oak, you may find them a little stiff.\nKANCH: I doubt it. (EFFORT AS —)\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 33\nTURLOUGH: Yes, one usually tries the handle before one resorts to using one’s boots?\nHOSS: Shut it, Ginger. (CALLING WHILE STEPPING INTO GREAT HALL) Rennol? Rennol — we’ve brought Deela and the boy as agreed.\nRENNOL: (OFF) I can see. (FX: SCRAPE OF A CHAIR AS HE RISES AND MEASURED FOOTSTEPS AS HE WALKS) Finally. The key has been delivered. Now we can begin.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 34\nTEGAN: Any change in course, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Not yet... wait. There’s a disturbance in the background radiation. A big plasma spill.\nDOCTOR: Caused by some kind of manoeuvre, perhaps? Thank you, Nyssa. Time to put on the brakes!\nTEGAN: Oh, thank heavens. Is that an asteroid up ahead?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s a planet.\nNYSSA: The planet where Turlough’s been taken?\nDOCTOR: So it seems. The trail leads here. (BEAT) I’1ll take us ina little lower.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 35\nHOSS: Deela, Turlough — get inside.\nKANCH: (PUSHES THEM) Do as Hoss says.\nRENNOL: Yes, do. You don’t want to argue with a gun like that in a hand like hers.\nTURLOUGH: I take it you’re Rennol?\nRENNOL: Halquin Rennol, businessman and entrepreneur.\nTURLOUGH: And squatter.\nRENNOL: Not though choice, I assure you. Tracking you down has taken longer than anticipated. I’ve had to live in this primitive hovel for weeks.\nKANCH: Yeah, we take all the risks abducting the boy, while you take it easy.\nRENNOL: I got you the girl, didn’t I? And what do you mean, easy? Dismantling the defences around the palace was anything but. Force shields, stasis traps...\nHOSS: Deela’s father’s documents showed you where the defences were set.\nRENNOL: I’m not an expert. That’s why I hired you.\nTURLOUGH: You should’ve hired a cleaner while you were at it. The upholstery on the chairs has a pattern under all that dust, you know.\nRENNOL: You won’t be sitting down, Turlough. Just kiss Deela.\nDEELA: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 36\nTURLOUGH: I.. I don’t understand.\nRENNOL: (IMPATIENT) Kiss her, Turlough. I know that’s the only way to open your “bubble”.\nKANCH: And if her face isn’t an incentive, how about my gun in yours?\nTURLOUGH: This is ridiculous! You can’t just expect us to — [kiss]\nDEELA: (AWKWARD) Oh, come on, Vizz. Not so bad, is it? Sooner we do as they say, the sooner they’1ll let us go.\nTURLOUGH: But will they?\nDEELA: Old times. Come on, we each put one hand on the wall, turn in, and...\nKANCH: Well?\nHOSS: Nothing.\nRENNOL: Where is it? The dimensional vault? It’s supposed to open.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know. The entrance used to appear beside the fireplace.\nDEELA: Maybe... our lips didn’t touch for long enough?\nKANCH: Or maybe this is a trick.\nTURLOUGH: How could it be? You brought me here yourself!\nRENNOL: The power can’t be getting through to the portal circuit...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 37\nTURLOUGH: What’s that?\nHOSS: My wrist communicator’s linked to the ship’s computer. (FX: HITS BUTTONS ON COMMS) Something’s entered the planet’s approach zone.\nKANCH: We can’t have been followed. We were in star-warp.\nHOSS: There’s a ship in low orbit. Most likely scanning the surface.\nDEELA: A Trion ship?\nHOSS: Maybe Rennol taking down the security systems alerted somebody.\nTURLOUGH: (MUTTERS) Or else it’s the Doctor...\nRENNOL: Relax. To any probing scanners, nobody’s home, remember?\nHOSS: We’re taking no chances. Kanch, get back to the ship and check it out. If it’s law enforcement, sit tight. Anyone else...\nKANCH: BOOM! Ha. I’m all over it. Me and a ground-to-air proton cannon are like these two lovebirds — made for each other. (EXITS, WHISTLING JAUNTILY )\nDEELA: (QUIET) I hope your friends didn’t follow you, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) So do I.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 38\nTEGAN: It’s all so white down there. Frozen. No sign of life.\nDOCTOR: I disagree. Look — signs of cultivation in the snowfields ahead. An estate, perhaps?\nTEGAN: And the lord of the manor must live right there. Look!\nNYSSA: A palace!\nDOCTOR: Magnificent, isn’t it? Could use a little restoration, but...\nDOCTOR: (FX: PROTON CANNON BLAST HITS OUTSIDE OF SHIP. EXPLOSION.

But that might just be my legs.\nNYSSA: (CLIMBING DOWN FROM SHIP) It does feel unsteady...\nNYSSA: Doctor! The ground’s splitting.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) The gravity buttresses must’ve weakened the whole area — it’s giving way. Run, Tegan. Get back from the ship.\nTEGAN: (BACKING OFF) What about you?\nDOCTOR: We'll be joining you. Come on, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the ice, it’s cracking open...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 47\nNYSSA: (FALLING) I’m falling...!\nTEGAN: Nyssa! (SHE STARTS FORWARD)\nDOCTOR: Tegan, stay back.\nTEGAN: How far has she dropped? Maybe there’s a ledge. Maybe...\nDOCTOR: She’s still falling. (BEAT) Thankfully, she’s falling slowly.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: More of that displaced gravity from the wells.\nNYSSA: (CALLING FROM BELOW) I’m all right.\nTEGAN: We must get down there, get her out.\nDOCTOR: I’ll go. Wait for us here, we may need your help climbing up again.\nTEGAN: I want to come!\nDOCTOR: Too risky. The local gravity field will be in flux down there. It’s reducing our weight right now, but it could shift and crush us at any second.\nTEGAN: (SULKY) Fine. Get going. Good luck.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (CALLING DOWN) Nyssa! Are you all right? Can you hear me?\nNYSSA: (FROM BELOW) Yes. I can see solid ground. There are tunnels down here. Partly caved in, but... passable I think.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR: Wait for me there. (TO TEGAN) See you shortly, Tegan. (TO SELF) Now, one small step for a Time Lord... but one giant LEAP... (JUMPS INTO THE CHASM)\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 49\nHOSS: Come on, boy. We’re waiting. Tell us about your ‘bubble’.\nTURLOUGH: The dimensional vault was a secret part of the palace architecture. Hoss. I’ve no idea how old it is.\nRENNOL: (KNOWINGLY) Haven’t you?\nTURLOUGH: My father certainly didn’t know anything about it. I only stumbled upon it myself when Deela was researching our clan’s history and discovered some of my great-grandfather’s old journals.\nDEELA: He was a real black sheep. Where you get it from, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: Great-grandfather helped set up a smuggling operation. He was storing contraband for space pirates in the ultimate safe house...\nHOSS: A pocket dimension?\nTURLOUGH: Don’t ask me how a Trion had access to that kind of technology back then. He shouldn’t have done. Either he was a visionary inventor —\nRENNOL: Or he stole alien tech.\nDEELA: That’s the likeliest explanation.\nTURLOUGH: His own great-grandfather was an ambassador to alien worlds in Trion’s colonial era, a member of the Royal Court. Building our colonies had upset a lot of other space powers...\nDEELA: By the time the Arar-Jecks had fought their way to Trion’s borders, this ambassador had done defence deals with many species — so there are clear links.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 50\nTURLOUGH: Anyway, I didn’t care about any of that at the time. All I knew was that Deela and I were the only two people alive who knew about my great-grandfather’s secret.\nDEELA: The old boy tried to double-cross the smugglers, and they killed him for it.\nHOSS: But if you didn’t understand the technology, how did you adapt the entry coder?\nTURLOUGH: You don’t have to understand the insides of a computer to make it work, do you? I’m not saying it was easy to get the vault open, but...\nTURLOUGH: DEELAs: We translated the interface codes...\nTURLOUGH: And I found the hidden portal controls. Two hundred years old, at least.\nRENNOL: The technology behind them is far older...\nTURLOUGH: Who knows? Or cares.\nDEELA: The portal appeared there, beside the fireplace. It opened onto a circular space as large as this room. Sort of.. pale and translucent. Shimmering like crystal. We felt so safe inside.\nRENNOL: I’m sure you miss it terribly.\nTURLOUGH: It was a good place to go to escape the boring world, a place our elders and betters didn’t know existed. That’s all. No magic, no great secrets.\nHOSS: Does his story tally with your own intelligence, Rennol?\nRENNOL: Oh... Near enough. (HE STEPS CLOSER TO TURLOUGH) Where are the hidden controls for the portal, Turlough?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 51\nTURLOUGH: It’s... a virtual interface. If the power supply is damaged we can’t access them.\nHOSS: That was a warning shot. A tapestry instead of your head. Lie to us again...\nDEELA: One of the stones pulls out from the wall.\nTURLOUGH: (ANGRY) Deela!\nDEELA: This one. The workings are built in behind. That’s why we had to touch the wall, it connects to our own bodies to measure the genetic transfer.\nRENNOL: Hoss, help me move the stone.\nHOSS: (DONE) Well, the circuitry doesn’t look too exotic.\nTURLOUGH: The lash-up you see to the fore is my handiwork.\nRENNOL: Then you’re well-placed to repair it.\nHOSS: Kanch has a toolset on board the ship. I’11 call him and get him to bring them. And then you’d better get the vault open before the sun is up, boy. If you can’t, your next kiss comes from the end of my gun.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: EERIE ATMOSPHERE DOWN HERE.

THESE WORDS SHOULDN’T BE EASILY DECIPHERABLE HERE — THEY ARE THE FIRST INDICATION OF THE MORASS FORMING, PERHAPS CHANGING SPEED AS THEY GO)\nMORASS: Enemy strike... STRIKE LANDED. Going to war footing. Prepare for absorption.\nNYSSA: Hello? Is anyone there?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING FROM ABOVE) Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (LOOKING UP) Doctor, I’m here!\nDOCTOR: (COMING DOWN) Are you hurt?\nNYSSA: (LOOKING UP) No, I landed lightly... Watch out, there are stalagmites stretching up nearer the ground. I caught hold of one and used it to break my fall.\nDOCTOR: Where...? Ah, yes. (EFFORT AS HE DOES THE SAME) And then, drift to the ground... (LANDS) .. as gently as a leaf in autumn.\nNYSSA: If only autumn leaves could drift back up again.\nDOCTOR: While we still weigh so little, perhaps we can jump and... (JUMPS — LANDS AGAIN, NORMALLY) Ah.\nNYSSA: We’re normal weight again. If that had happened a few moments sooner while you were on your way down...\nDOCTOR: That’s why I asked Tegan to wait for us.\nNYSSA: I’m not sure it’s any safer up there. If whoever shot us down comes looking... poor Tegan’s alone.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: I didn’t want to leave her. (FX: SLIGHT TREMOR, AS IN PREVIOUS PALACE SCENE) The question is, are WE alone?\nNYSSA: That scraping sound. It seems to be coming from the rock.\nDOCTOR: Tectonic activity? Hmm. There’s definitely a vibration of some kind. Can you feel it?\nDOCTOR: NYSSAs: Yes. But is it natural or artificial?\nDOCTOR: Good question. It could be coming from some sort of power source. Perhaps these catacombs are in use? Given their proximity to the palace...\nNYSSA: One of these tunnels might lead there.\nDOCTOR: Or even back to the surface. You must have seen the walls of this chasm — they’re sheer. There’s no way we can climb out.\nNYSSA: I agree.\nDOCTOR: Time for an expedition, then. Splendid. (CALLING UP) Tegan! I’ve found Nyssa. She’s all right. We’re going to look into these catacombs and try to find a way back up to you. [..]\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: (FX: DISTANT, FROM BELOW) [..] Stay close to the ship. We’1l be as quick as we can.\nTEGAN: (SHOUTS BACK) All right! Be careful! (TO SELF) Stay close? I’1l stay inside — I’m frozen solid out here. Please let whoever owned this wreck have left some warm clothes on board.\nTEGAN: (FX: SHE STEPS TENTATIVELY INSIDE THE CRASHED SHIP — LOUD PROTESTING CREAK OF METAL)\nTEGAN: And please don’t let anything fall on top of me before I find them!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 55\nKANCH: (CALLING FROM CORRIDOR, OFF) Hoss? Hoss! Which way is it again? These tools weigh a ton!\nHOSS: In here, Kanch!\nRENNOL: Finally.\nDEELA: (QUIET) Thought he’d found the hidden way into the catacombs for a minute, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) If we can only get there...\nDEELA: (QUIET) We don’t need to. If we do as they say they’1l let us\nDEELA: go.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) Look at them! The queen of space trash, a frustrated fop who looks ready for a nervous breakdown and...\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) .. that maniac!\nRENNOL: You nearly brought that ship down on our heads, Kanch. Almost got us killed.\nKANCH: No ‘almost’ with me, Rennol. If I wanted you killed — you would be. (BEAT) Vault not open yet?\nHOSS: Obviously not.\nRENNOL: But we have uncovered the portal generation interface.\nHOSS: The controls that the kissing key unlocks.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 56\nTURLOUGH: For all the good it does. You can see the circuitry is largely crystalline. It was decaying when I altered it last time, and now...\nRENNOL: The circuitry ought to regenerate itself. In his notes, Deela’s father is most emphatic about that.\nTURLOUGH: He’s always emphatic — never more so than when he’s wrong.\nHOSS: Well if it won’t repair itself you’1ll have to do it. (PAUSE) Now.\nKANCH: Or the girl gets hurt. (GRABS DEELA)\nDEELA: (GASPS, GRABBED BY KANCH) Please, Vizz!\nTURLOUGH: I can’t!\nDEELA: At least try!\nTURLOUGH: You can’t hurt her, Kanch. Not if you want to get into the vault.\nKANCH: I'll leave her face alone. But the rest...\nHOSS: Oh, leave her be, Kanch. Gallantry doesn’t come easily to this one. It’s his own skin he cares about. (GRABS TURLOUGH BY THROAT) Ian’t that right, Ginger?\nTURLOUGH: (CHOKING) Please, let go...\nHOSS: And if he wants his skin to keep fitting he’1ll get on with repairing the circuit NOW. (RELEASES HIM)\nTURLOUGH: (PANTING) All right. All right!\nDEELA: (AGGRIEVED) Oh, so now you’ll help?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 57\nTURLOUGH: I.. I'll start by testing the holo-cell circuits with your charge-driver...\nHOSS: To be on the safe side, Kanch, I think we’d better check out the wreck of that ship you brought down.\nKANCH: Loot it, you mean?\nHOSS: No, to be sure everyone aboard is dead and that no one’s heading this way with a grudge and a big gun. (BEAT) Remember, any survivors will be friends of Ginger’s. To us, expendable. But to him...\nRENNOL: Yes. We might yet find a way to increase Turlough’s enthusiasm for the job in hand...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA ARE FEELING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ICY TUNNELS. THE GRATING WHISPERS ARE HERE, SLOWLY GROWING LOUDER AND LEGIBLE)\nMORASS: War footing. Impact absorbed. Invaders. Morass. Absorbing.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Yes, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) None of these passages are leading upward to the surface...\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) No. Not yet, anyway.\nNYSSA: (STOPPED) And that sound seems louder. I’m not convinced it’s down to the gravity field permeating the rock.\nDOCTOR: Neither am I.\nNYSSA: It’s too regular. Like a message. A repeated message.\nDOCTOR: A repeated message? Interesting. There’s something else: it seems to be getting lighter.\nNYSSA: You’re right.\nDOCTOR: The ice in these catacombs would appear to have some rather peculiar properties.\nNYSSA: Luminescence?\nDOCTOR: That’s one. Now, feel the wall here. Feel the ice.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 59\nNYSSA: 3: Cold. Wet.\nDOCTOR: And?\nNYSSA: A.. sort of tingling.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Possibly a kind of molecular oscillation, producing the charge of light — a part of the design of these catacombs. Judging from the striations in the rock at regular intervals I’d hazard a guess the passages didn’t form naturally. They were mined out by machines.\nNYSSA: I see what you mean.\nDOCTOR: It’s just a pity whoever built them didn’t put up a few road Signs while they were about it.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AT THIS POINT MORASS WORDS GET LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD — THOUGH STILL VERY DISTORTED)\nNYSSA: Do you think this repeated message is anything to do with the molecular oscillation, Doctor? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ssh, I’m trying to listen.\nMORASS: . Absorbing. Morass. Absorbing.\nNYSSA: Sounds like it’s saying... ‘absorbing morass’. A morass of what?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. But what if that noise is being made by some kind of life form, using the ice as a medium to speak through?\nNYSSA: Well, why would you think that?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m looking at that life form now.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 60\nTEGAN: (PUTTING A COAT ON) Guess a coat’s a coat, whatever it smells like. Ugh.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) And a scary noise is just a scary noise until...\nKANCH: (OFF) Gaw! Made a mess of this old tug, didn’t I, Hoss?\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) .. until you know you’ve got company.\nHOSS: (OFF) We search it. From top to bottom.\nKANCH: (OFF) Come on. No one could’ve survived a crash like this! It’s caved in half the hillside.\nHOSS: (OFF) We’ll know for sure when we’ve found the bodies.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 61\nRENNOL: Any progress, Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Not yet.\nDEELA: Why isn’t the system responding?\nRENNOL: You hear that? Deela wants this all over. She wants to go home.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t have a home to go to and you’ve most likely murdered my friends. Where do I go, Rennol?\nRENNOL: That’1ll be down to you.\nTURLOUGH: (SIGHS) I don’t know what’s wrong. It’s possible my adaptation has led to some kind of power seepage.\nDEELA: But it’s only been a few years since we used it last.\nTURLOUGH: (INSTANT) Three-and-three-quarter years. (EMBARRASSED) Give or take.\nRENNOL: I wonder if you’re telling me the truth about these systems.\nTURLOUGH: Do you?\nRENNOL: Look at these. (FX. BIP! WHIRRRR) Schematics stolen from Deela’s father. Wiring diagrams, right?\nTURLOUGH: Not a design I recognise.\nRENNOL: There’s a power source marked here — right? But it bears zero resemblance to that circuit. So how do you explain it?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 62\nTURLOUGH: (ANGRY) I don’t know where your wiring diagram comes from! This is the only circuit I’m aware of, here in the wall. There could well be other systems behind it, and that could be where the power to the portal generator has seeped into — but this is the interface I used to gain access to the Bubble.\nTURLOUGH: (FX: DISTANT CRASH — HEAVY LIKE ROCK SMASHING TO THE GROUND, MUFFLED )\nDEELA: What was that?\nRENNOL: (UNNERVED) Just... Hoss and Kanch. Must be them coming back.\nTURLOUGH: That vibration in the floor. I can still feel it...\nRENNOL: Shut up. And remember I have my own gun. Keep working on that circuit. (CROSSES TO DOOR. CALLS) Hoss? Kanch, is that you?\nDEELA: (SOTTO) Vizz, were you really going to let Kanch hurt me?\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) I’m sorry if it seemed that way. I... I just wanted them to see they couldn’t push me and you around.\nDEELA: (SOTTO) You never were a good liar.\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) Listen. If there IS some great treasure in the vault, why should they have it?\nDEELA: (SOTTO) You mean you CAN open the Bubble?\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) Whatever’s in there, whatever we missed before — I think we deserve first crack at it, don’t you?\nDEELA: (SOTTO) We? You and me? Like in the old days?\nRENNOL: (WALKING UP) What’re you two whispering about?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 63\nDEELA: I’m just trying to help him. (THEN LOWER, TO TURLOUGH) When you do get it working... d’you think the portal will open on the first kiss?\nTURLOUGH: It’s been some time. It may take several goes.\nDEELA: (SOFTLY) Good.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 64\nKANCH: Reckon that’s the whole ship, Hoss-boss, and we haven’t trodden on anything nasty.\nHOSS: Maybe not. But someone’s been treading ice in here.\nKANCH: What?\nHOSS: Footprints, see? Still wet.\nKANCH: Well — they must be ours.\nHOSS: Except that neither of us is wearing heels.\nKANCH: Survivors? Where’re they hiding?\nHOSS: We’1ll soon see. (CALLS) In ten seconds we’re going to destroy this spaceship. Ten. Nine. Eight. Kanch, prime the frag grenade. Seven. Six. Five.\nTEGAN: (OFF, METAL ECHO) (TO SELF) Oh, rabbits! (ALOUD, STEPPING OUT FROM OFF) All right! All right, I’m coming out. —\nKANCH: Ohh, she was in the gravity well! Clever.\nHOSS: You. Come forward. What’s your name?\nTEGAN: Tegan Jovanka.\nHOSS: Where are your associates, Tegan?\nTEGAN: Dead.\nHOSS: Is that so.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 65\nTEGAN: The Doctor was killed on Vektris when you took off. My friend Nyssa got out, but slipped and fell down that crevasse.\nHOSS: How unfortunate. All of you dying for one solitary, snot-nosed boy.\nTEGAN: What have you done with Turlough?\nHOSS: Put him to work. Something of a first, I’d imagine. Oh, and just in case you only imagined the fate of your friend — Kanch, frag the ship, just to be on the safe side.\nKANCH: Fragging it. Thirty second fuse.\nTEGAN: Do what you want. Just take me to Turlough.\nKANCH: This way. (BEAT) I’d shift if I were you. When that thing goes up there’s going to be a mighty big bang.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 66\nMORASS: Data assimilating. Power charging.\nNYSSA: (HORROR) Look at it. Is it... a man?\nDOCTOR: Humanoid certainly. In this light, through the ice, it’s hard to be any more accurate.\nNYSSA: His mouth is moving... Can he be alive in there? Cryogenics might be able to preserve the body...\nDOCTOR: While he’s still conscious? I don’t know. As I said, this ice has some very interesting properties.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ENORMOUS BLAST FROM ABOVE RATTLES THE CATACOMBS — THE CRASHED SPACESHIP GOING UP. DEBRIS FALLS FROM ROOF)\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What was that?\nMORASS: (CLEARER NOW — AND EVEN SCARIER) War footing. War footing.\nDOCTOR: It came from above ground. Whatever it was, he seems to have found it disagreeable.\nMORASS: Absorbing. Morass, I shall be. Morass, we shall be. Morass, they shall be.\nDOCTOR: Or perhaps the reverse. Drawing energy from the percussive impact moving through the rock.\nNYSSA: Doctor! The light!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Cover your eyes, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: It’s everywhere!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: The ice crystals seem to be transmitting [energy. ]\nDOCTOR: (FX: DROWNED OUT AS PART OF THE ICE WALL EXPLODES.

Turn!\nDEELA: What is it?\nRENNOL: What have you found?\nTURLOUGH: That power seepage. Something’s getting through — a little of this decay has self-repaired —\nRENNOL: . but?\nTURLOUGH: . but, the bulk of the energy’s being diverted. That schematic of yours really must relate to some other power source Deela’s father found here.\nDEELA: In the wall, you mean?\nTURLOUGH: Or beneath the floor... into the catacombs.\nRENNOL: A back-up power generator?\nDEELA: Could be the cause of the vibration. And it feels to be getting stronger.\nTURLOUGH: It doesn’t really matter. The point is, if I can trap a little of the regenerating energy and loop it round the circuit, build the power that way...\nRENNOL: And can you?\nTURLOUGH: I need access to this lattice at the back, but this metal load- plate is blocking it. (STRAINS) It won’t budge. Rennol, you want whatever’s inside so much — why don’t you try to shift it?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 69\nRENNOL: Of course. Tell you what, I’1l1 just put away the gun, turn my back to you and let you overpower me. (HARD) We’1l wait for Hoss and Kanch.\nDEELA: You said that crashing noise was them coming ages ago. So where are they?\nRENNOL: They’1ll be here.\nTEGAN: (FROM CORRIDOR, STRUGGLING) Get your hands off of me!\nHOSS: (FROM CORRIDOR, APPROACHING) Stop wriggling and we might.\nRENNOL: (RELIEVED) See?\nTEGAN: (SHOVED IN) I am not — wriggling!\nKANCH: (ARRIVING) Hey — look what we found, hiding in the wreckage.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan! You’re all right!\nTEGAN: Oh, Turlough. Am I glad to see you.\nTURLOUGH: You are?\nRENNOL: Hoss, was it you who made that crashing noise?\nHOSS: We blew up the wreck of their ship.\nRENNOL: This sounded like it was inside. Something heavy falling.\nHOSS: Knocked over by the impact, perhaps. Kanch, you’d better search the palace properly. Maybe Tegan’s friends aren’t as dead as she makes out.\nTURLOUGH: Dead?!\nKANCH: Hope not.\nKANCH: enough to\nTURLOUGH: Tegan, do\nTURLOUGH: I... see.\nTEGAN: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 70\nTEGAN: (FX: LOCKS AND LOADS) Be as quick as I can. But long enjoy it. (FX: EXITS)\nTEGAN: you mean that the Doctor, Nyssa...?\nTEGAN: They’1l never see their native Earth again.\nTEGAN: That’s why I’m wearing this... special coat of mourning.

(FX: TRICKLING WATER) Feel the ice here.\nNYSSA: It’s melting! The man in the ice — you can see him!\nDOCTOR: The power must be increasing. But power from where, what’s causing this?\nMORASS: (PAINED, HOARSE) Morass. Absorbing. Invaders. Absorbing. Morass.\nNYSSA: The ice all around him. It’s boiling away. Doctor, we must try to help.\nDOCTOR: Let me see. (PUSHES FORWARD) The ice isn’t only boiling around him. It’s boiling out of him.\nNYSSA: The ice was inside his body?\nDOCTOR: Sustaining him, somehow...\nDOCTOR: (FX: MAN’S BODY FALLS WITH WET THUD. DOCTOR AND NYSSA CROUCH TO SEE )\nNYSSA: Well, it’s not sustaining him any more. Poor creature, he’s dead.\nDOCTOR: And already rotting. (STRAIGHTENS) This chamber holding him in the ice-wall.

Like an invisible pocket in reality.\nTEGAN: Is that why they kidnapped you — to open the door to this vault thing?\nTURLOUGH: They think there’s some great treasure hidden inside.\nHOSS: We'll be seeing what’s hidden inside your friend’s skull if you don’t get a shift on. And won’t that make a mess of her ‘coat of mourning’?\nTURLOUGH: I’ve told Rennol, there’s a metal plate obstructing the lattice. I can’t move it. (HE STRAINS AGAIN) See?\nRENNOL: All right, step away. Now Hoss is here, I'll try.\nHOSS: No, Rennol. First, let the girl have a go. In case Turlough thought to spring a trap on the next person who volunteered. (PUSHES HER) Go on.\nTURLOUGH: It’s all right, Tegan.\nTEGAN: I’m just glad I’m wearing this big old coat...\nRENNOL: What are you..? She’s up to something!\nTEGAN: Think there’s something up my sleeve? Well, I hate to disappoint you... (FLOURISHING METAL BAR) .. but you’re right!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 74\nRENNOL: It’s only a metal bar.\nHOSS: No. It’s the generator tube from a gravity well.\nTEGAN: And I’1l use it if I have to. (FX: WHACKS METAL BAR AGAINST WALL — CLANG)\nRENNOL: Don’t! If you discharge a high gravity field you’1ll smear us all over the wall!\nTEGAN: I will..? (HIDES SURPRISE AND HARDENS) I will.

Then that creature back there said, “Function error.”\nDOCTOR: But what is their function? Look, where the ice in the walls has fallen away.\nNYSSA: Alcoves. Not as deep as the one where that poor man was being held.\nDOCTOR: No. More like a container for something.\nNYSSA: Perhaps for something like that creature. The Morass, or whatever it said it was.\nDOCTOR: What else did it say?\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: It made little sense. Said that we had been absorbed. And that it was going to “war footing”.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I don’t like the sound of that, do you?\nNYSSA: We should get away from here.\nDOCTOR: We can only press on and hope to reach that palace we saw...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 82\nNYSSA: Why?\nDOCTOR: Well, it may offer shelter.\nNYSSA: No, I mean, why did Turlough’s abductors bring him here?\nDOCTOR: That’s a good question. And if some kind of program has been activated — have they done something to set it off?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 83\nTURLOUGH: (TO HALT, DITTO DEELA) Tegan, no. This way.\nTEGAN: (STOPPING) But when Hoss and Kanch marched me in here, we came this way.\nDEELA: She’s right. It’s that way to the spaceships.\nTURLOUGH: Which is why we’re going in the other direction.\nDEELA: But surely we need to go back to the— [ships]\nTURLOUGH: That’s the first place they’1l look for us. By the time we've broken in...\nTEGAN: Point taken. Besides, somehow we’ve got to find the Doctor and Nyssa.\nDEELA: You said your friends were dead.\nTEGAN: They’re alive — I hope. When the ship crashed, it caved in the hillside. They found an underground tunnel.\nDEELA: One of the catacombs?\nTURLOUGH: Just as well. That’s where we’re going. (WALKING) Come on, along here.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) What’s with the local knowledge?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) This is my family’s palace.\nDEELA: (WALKING) They used to own the planet.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 84\nTEGAN: (STOPPING) The planet! How can they own the whole— [planet]\nTURLOUGH: (STOPPED) You humans, you see everything on such a small scale. Come on, the door’s just here.\nTEGAN: What door?\nTURLOUGH: I told you, to the catacombs!\nTEGAN: Don’t get shirty with me, Turlough! I see no door!\nTURLOUGH: That’s beause the entrance to the catacombs is hidden. But if you press on the right part of the right flagstone...\nTURLOUGH: (FX: STAMPS ON FLOOR. STONE DOOR GRINDS OPEN. BLAST OF COLD AIR FROM WITHIN)\nTEGAN: A secret door leading to a spooky tunnel? Did your family buy\nTEGAN: this planet from Enid Blyton?\nDEELA: Who?\nTEGAN: Never mind.\nTURLOUGH: (PUSHING THEM THROUGH) Just get in, will you!\nTEGAN: It’s freezing down there!\nTURLOUGH: Stop complaining! In!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 85\nNYSSA: (WALKING) How much further? It feels like we’ve been down here for days.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Yes. But if we continue to follow these power lines, we'll soon see light at the end of the tunnel.\nNYSSA: (STOPPING) Are you sure? It seems to be getting darker.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Hmm. That “function error” must have affected the lighting...\nNYSSA: Presumably these lines — if they are power lines — lead away from the place where that man was held in the ice?\nDOCTOR: Yes — to a power source of some kind. I hope.\nNYSSA: A power source that generates the “Morass”? (SIGHS) I do hope Tegan’s all right.\nDOCTOR: Yes... (SUDDENLY PAINED) Argh!\nNYSSA: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: My fingers. Burning. It’s alright, fuss and nonsense.\nNYSSA: Show me. (PAUSE — THEN SHE REACTS) Doctor, it’s not just burning, it’s boiling.\nDOCTOR: That’s impossible— Agh! (GASPS IN PAIN)\nNYSSA: The wound, the surrounding flesh - the blood is actually boiling!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 86\nTURLOUGH: Come on, you two, keep moving.\nTEGAN: With all this debris everywhere, it’s hard to go faster. Looks like the roof’s caved in.\nDEELA: That would explain that crash we heard, Vizz. The tremors, too.\nTEGAN: \"Vizz\"?\nTURLOUGH: (EMBARRASSED) Never mind. (CHANGING SUBJECT) But it’s not just the roof, is it? It’s the walls as well.\nTEGAN: What about them-?\nDEELA: They’ve split open...!\nTEGAN: Oh, yeah. They look like... I don’t know, like alcoves.\nDEELA: I suppose the crash of your spaceship must have impacted on the whole area.\nTURLOUGH: So the sooner we work our way through to the surface — and put some real distance between us and Rennol and the others — the better.\nTEGAN: Too right. How long do these tunnels go on for?\nTURLOUGH: A mile or so. My great-grandfather used them as part of his smuggling operation.\nDEELA: My father believes the catacombs go back way further than that. Your great-grandfather may have used them — but he didn’t build them...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 87\nHOSS: Well, well, well. Look, Kanch.\nKANCH: Look at what?\nHOSS: Deela’s scarf. She must have dropped it.\nKANCH: That was stupid of her.\nHOSS: (THOUGHTFUL) There’s frost on the floor.\nKANCH: Yeah, someone should fix the draughts in this place. Are we going?\nHOSS: Idiot. Where’d the frost come from?\nKANCH: Er, I don’t know. It looks like it came from the wall.\nHOSS: It might look like a wall. But I’m betting it’s a hidden entrance.\nKANCH: Entrance? To where?\nHOSS: Well, we’ll find out, won’t we? When we work out how to make open...\nHOSS: it\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 88\nNYSSA: Doctor, we need to treat that injury. I don’t like the look of pike\nDOCTOR: (A BIT DISTANT, ANSWERING A VOICE HE CAN HEAR IN HIS HEAD) Yes. Yes, I hear you.\nNYSSA: Well then, we must get a move on. I saw a medical kit in the spaceship. I only hope it survived the crash. (BEAT) Are you listening to me?\nDOCTOR: Please be quiet, Nyssa. I’m trying to listen.\nNYSSA: Listen to what?\nNYSSA: (FX: CUT HARD TO INSIDE THE DOCTOR’S HEAD. THE MORASS IS SPEAKING TO HIM TELEPATHICALLY )\nMORASS: (TELEPATHIC) Our energy source is dead.\nDOCTOR: Words. Words, in my head. It seems to be speaking to me.\nNYSSA: What is?\nDOCTOR: The presence. The thing that lives in the ice. The Morass.\nNYSSA: Well, I don’t hear anything.\nDOCTOR: That’s because it’s not got inside you. Like it got inside me.\nNYSSA: Through your injury!\nDOCTOR: Inside me, like it used to be inside the man in the ice... (TO MORASS) Is that right?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 89\nMORASS: (TELEPATHIC) He has no more power. You shall give us power.\nDOCTOR: No!\nMORASS: (TELEPATHIC) Drive out the invaders! Kill!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, you’ve got to leave me.\nNYSSA: I can’t!\nDOCTOR: I mean it, Nyssa. Go!\nNYSSA: Don’t push me away. I can help!\nDOCTOR: It can see out through me. It might make me harm you. I mean it, Nyssa! Go!\nNYSSA: I’ll find Tegan. I’1ll be back. (EXITING, CALLING BACK) And I’1l bring that medical kit!\nDOCTOR: Go! (TO SELF) I have to fight it. Fight it!\nMORASS: (TELEPATHIC) Fight. And protect. That is all we know...\nDOCTOR: Morass, whatever you are.. Kindly get out of my head.\nMORASS: (TELEPATHIC) That is all.\nDOCTOR: Get out!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 90\nTEGAN: These tunnels give me the creeps.\nDEELA: Turlough and I used to play down here as children. Even though my father forbade it.\nTURLOUGH: Your father forbade everything.\nTURLOUGH: Shh! What’s that?\nTURLOUGH: (IT IS THE MORASS — BUT WE’LL THINK IT’S NYSSA AS THE MORASS\nTURLOUGH: USES ITS MASS FOR IMPERSONATING “INVADERS”. PERHAPS WE USE A\nTURLOUGH: SLIGHT EDGE ON THE VOICE TO SUGGEST MORASS — BUILD THE EFFECT SUBTLY OVER A FEW LINES?)\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 27]: Hello? Is anyone there?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa?\nTEGAN: Are we ever glad to see you.\nTEGAN: MORASS-NYSSA (SC 41): Are you all right, now?\nTURLOUGH: Just about. This is Deela, she was kidnapped like me.\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-NYSSA (SC 41): Are you all right {,—nRew?}\nTEGAN: Why do you keep saying that?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan, look — her eyes...\nDEELA: Glassy.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 91\nTEGAN: Nyssa? Has something happened? (CRIES OUT AS NYSSA GRABS HER THROAT — SHE’S BEING STRANGLED!) Get off! You’re choking me! Nyssa!\nTEGAN: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 46]: Don’t push me away.\nTEGAN: Get off me. Turlough!\nDEELA: Run, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: We can’t just leave Tegan.\nDEELA: You want to be next?\nTURLOUGH: (RUNS FORWARD) Whatever you are, get OFF her!\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-NYSSA (SC 46): Don’t push me away —\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-NYSSA:\nTEGAN: Nyssa? What the... [hell?]\nHOSS: If your friend wasn’t dead before, she is now.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, no.\nDEELA: Hoss!\nKANCH: Don’t forget me, sweets. Come here. (GRABS HER — SHE GASPS)\nTURLOUGH: Let go of her, Kanch!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 92\nHOSS: Don’t worry. We’re not going to kill the lovely Deela. It’s\nHOSS: Tegan Jovanka who’se going to get it, like her weird friend\nHOSS: there. Then we’re going to go back to the Great Hall, so you can fix the damage she — [caused]\nTEGAN: Shut up and look. You didn’t kill Nyssa.\nHOSS: That was a high-level laser blast, she couldn’t have— [INTAKE OF BREATH ]\nKANCH: Those blasts make a mess... but I never saw anyone melt into slush before.\nDEELA: Someone’s coming.\nDEELA: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 27]: (APPROACHING) Hello? Is anyone there?\nHOSS: It.. it’s another her!\nTEGAN: Another Nyssa!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: I.. can’t move. Morass, what are you doing to me?\nMORASS: Our flesh will become your flesh. You will become... encased.\nDOCTOR: In ice? Like that man we met?\nMORASS: We are not ice. We are the Morass. You will feed us. Your flesh will become ours.\nDOCTOR: I am not willing to feed you!\nMORASS: We will devour you. Invade the invader.\nDOCTOR: I am not an invader. I am the Doctor. A visitor from space.\nMORASS: We came under attack. We were bombarded. Invaded.\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t a bombardment. Our ship crashed, by accident. Causing some of the catacombs to collapse.\nMORASS: We are on war footing.\nDOCTOR: But this isn’t war!\nMORASS: Protect. War footing.\nDOCTOR: We came to find a friend of ours, he’s been taken.\nMORASS: Function error.\nDOCTOR: Yes! Function error! You know this isn’t right.\nMORASS: Power low. Absorbing.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 34]: Are we under attack?\nTEGAN: Nyssa, is that you?\nTEGAN: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 30]: Cold. Wet.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan, get back. Her eyes are glassy, like before. It isn’t her!\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 30]: ‘absorbing morass’.\nHOSS: Absorb this!\nTURLOUGH: We won’t learn anything about them if all you’re going to do, Hoss, is blow them to bits.\nHOSS: That freak was the one who needed a lesson. Whatever it was, it’s dead now.\nHOSS: MORASS-NYSSA 2 & 3 [SCENE 27]: Hello? Is anyone there?/Hello?\nTEGAN: You were saying?\nKANCH: How many more of them are there?\nKANCH: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 34]: Are we under attack?\nHOSS: What the hell is happening?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 95\nKANCH: Ugh!\nKANCH: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 36]: Poor creature, he’s dead.\nHOSS: (SPINS ROUND) Kanch? Get up, where did they hit you?\nDEELA: There’s another one, behind us!\nDEELA: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 46]: Don’t push me away.\nDEELA: She’s got Kanch’s gun.\nTEGAN: Her eyes — like ice, like the others.\nTEGAN: MORASS-DOCTOR [SCENE 30]: The ice in these catacombs would seem to have some rather interesting properties.\nHOSS: You?!?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor!\nTEGAN: No, Turlough — look at him, he’s like those Nyssa-things.\nTEGAN: MORASS-DOCTOR [SCENE 30]: Feel the ice.\nHOSS: I don’t think so! (FX: SHE SHOOTS — MORASS-DOCTOR MELTS. )\nTEGAN: Melting, like the others.\nTEGAN: DEELAs: I feel sick.\nTURLOUGH: Watch out, there’s more of them right behind!\nTURLOUGH: MORASS-DOCTOR [SCENE 30]: Feel the ice.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: MORASS-DOCTOR [SCENE 36]: It’s boiling out of him.\nHOSS: So long as they keep coming, I’11 keep shooting.\nTEGAN: (LOW) And while she’s busy, we can get away from those Doctor things.\nDEELA: (LOW) What about Kanch’s gun-?\nTURLOUGH: (LOW) Buried under bodies. I’d sooner our own didn’t join them. Come on. (THEY MOVE OFF)\nHOSS: (FX: STILL FIRING AT MORASS-DOCTORS/NYSSAS) Hey, where’d’you think you’re going-?\nTEGAN: (CALLING BACK) Keep firing, Hoss! It’s what you’re best at!\nHOSS: But — you can’t leave me! I need help to move Kanch!\nHOSS: (FX: THE M-DOCTORS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER — ALL PARROTING RANDOM DOCTOR LINES FROM EARLIER CATACOMBS SCENES )\nHOSS: Kanch! Wake up!

(FX: LASER BLAST) (YELLS) I can keep this up as long as you can!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 99\nDEELA: (CATCHING BREATH) I don’t believe it... we made it past them!\nTEGAN: That last Nyssa took a real swipe at me. Tore the coat right off my shoulders.\nTURLOUGH: You can keep warm by running.\nTEGAN: Sure you know where we’re running to?\nTURLOUGH: I think if we keep going this way, we’ll —\nTEGAN: Wait!\nDEELA: What’s coming for us now?\nNYSSA: (TO HALT) Tegan! Turlough!\nDEELA: Another one!\nTURLOUGH: Get it! Hit it! Smash it!\nNYSSA: What are you doing, it’s me!\nTEGAN: Turlough, look — her eyes.\nNYSSA: What about my eyes?\nTEGAN: Normal, not glassy. Nyssa, it really is you! (HUGS HER)\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 100\nNYSSA: I’m glad to see you too, but listen —\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, there are creatures down there — creatures identical to you and the Doctor.\nDEELA: And ready to kill.\nTURLOUGH: This is Deela, by the way. She was taken, like me.\nNYSSA: Hello, Deela.\nTEGAN: Where is the Doctor?\nNYSSA: I’ve been trying to tell you. He’s hurt. The ice in the walls, it’s some kind of... I don’t know, organism. It got inside him.\nTEGAN: What?\nNYSSA: He’s back down this way. He sent me away, he was worried he might become... violent.\nTURLOUGH: You’d better show me.\nTEGAN: And me.\nTURLOUGH: I think it’s best if you stay here on watch, with Deela.\nTEGAN: Why? I’m just as strong as you are!\nTURLOUGH: And a good deal louder. So I’d feel happier with you watching our backs, ready to sound the alarm?\nTEGAN: (RELUCTANTLY) All right.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL)\nDEELA: Hurry back, Vizz!\nTURLOUGH: I will. Depend on that.\nNYSSA: See you as soon as we can.\nNYSSA: Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: MORASS-NYSSA [SCENE 34]: Are we under attack?\nHOSS: (FX: COMMS BLEEP) (INTO COMMS) Rennol, this is Hoss. Come in, Rennol. —\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) Hoss? Where are you?\nHOSS: Rennol, I need back-up. I’m stuck in these damned catacombs. Kanch is down and I’m under attack.\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) Attack? What’s attacking?\nHOSS: Replicas of people. Don’t know where they came from.\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) The security system. So it really is active. And effective?\nHOSS: They’re not very strong but there’s so many of them. (FX: TWO MORE BLASTS) I need your help to move Kanch out.\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) What about Deela and Turlough? Have you found them?\nHOSS: They got away.\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) Hopefully they’1l make their way back here. I think the portal circuit is drawing enough power to regenerate now. The energy drain was most likely caused by the security system starting up and initialising. The panel here is definitely part of a larger circuit...\nHOSS: Rennol, enough of the theories. You’ve got a map, come in here and help me.\nRENNOL: (VIA COMMS) You’re breaking up, Hoss. You want the digi-map of the tunnels? I don’t have it as a separate file, it’s part of a data bundle. I’1l send it over.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 103\nHOSS: You can’t just... (FX: TWO LASER BLASTS) Rennol, I need back-up!\nRENNOL: (INTO COMMS) I can’t hear what you’re saying, Hoss. Rennol out.\nRENNOL: (TO SELF) Contract terminated. One more expense eliminated, and I didn’t have to lift a finger.\nRENNOL: (FX: CROSSES THE ROOM — AND A GENTLE PULSATING HUM GROWS IN VOLUME )\nRENNOL: (TO SELF) .. Not even to fix the circuit. (SIGHS) You’d better be taking good care of Deela, Turlough. When you get back here... everything will be mine for the taking.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 104\nDEELA: I wonder what’s taking Turlough.\nTEGAN: He'll be back. He’s got more guts than I give him credit for, that boy.\nDEELA: Yes. When his own skin’s at stake.\nTEGAN: Bit harsh, isn’t it?\nDEELA: Probably. He’s changed since I knew him, though. Distant. Wary. He used to be so... (CATCHES HERSELF) Oh, it doesn’t matter.\nTEGAN: You’ve known him a long time?\nDEELA: All my life. (PAUSE) You and Turlough. Are you...?\nTEGAN: What? No way. But... you two look like you’ve got something going on.\nDEELA: I always looked up to him. I thought he was incredible. So clever. Such an attitude. We grew closer as our fathers grew apart. He never cared about any of that grown-up stuff. I did, I tried to hide it, but... Well. When we were in our Bubble, none of that mattered. We were safe. Shut off from everything.\nTEGAN: Your Bubble — that thing Hoss and Rennol want open?\nDEELA: I want it open. Turlough fixed it so that when we kissed, there it was. Our safe haven. Just ours. (BEAT) I want to go back. Back to how things were.\nTEGAN: Hiding away from the world only makes it that much harder when you go back. And you always have to go back.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 105\nDEELA: I always thought if I had him, I’d feel happy. But we always want more, don’t we? Never happy with how things are until they change. (SIGHS) You’re right. It can never be like it was. Not now.\nTEGAN: Life goes on, Deela. You make what you can of it. And when it stops being fun.. you make it something else.\nDEELA: Is this the fun part?\nTEGAN: This? (SIGHS) This is definitely something else.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 106\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING) Where did you leave him?\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING) It was somewhere just along here... (SEES DOCTOR IN ICE) Oh no. Look!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? How did this ice form around him so fast?\nNYSSA: I told you, it’s not just ice.\nTURLOUGH: How do we get him out?\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) With difficulty.\nTURLOUGH: He can hear us!\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) Turlough. You’re here. You must reach into the ice.\nTURLOUGH: And do what?\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) There’s a knot of ice crystals, above my head. The crystals are ganglia. Still growing. A kind of mind... growing into my own.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: I believe him.\nTURLOUGH: It might not be the Doctor talking. We know these things have taken his form as well as yours.\nNYSSA: I said, I believe him.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) Both of you... It will take both. Please — you must reach in.\nTURLOUGH: If you’re wrong, Nyssa...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) Quickly!\nNYSSA: After three, Turlough. One... two...\nTURLOUGH: Three!\nTURLOUGH: (FX: FINGERS PENETRATING HALF-FORMED ICE. SLUDGY, CRACKLING WITH ENERGY )\nTURLOUGH: (FEELING) Above his head... there is something there.\nNYSSA: I can’t get to it. The ice, it’s too solid.\nTURLOUGH: No, no. It’s giving way...\nNYSSA: My hands. They’re burning...\nTURLOUGH: Mine too. Quickly!\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED BY ICE) You must pull out the ganglia. Pull!\nTURLOUGH: I can feel it!\nTURLOUGH: NYSSA3: It’s horrible...!\nTURLOUGH: I’ve got it!\nNYSSA: Then pull!\nNYSSA: (FX: THEY YANK OUT THE GANGLIA — SQUELCHES, POWER DRAIN — THEN ICE SHATTERS )\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 108\nTURLOUGH: The ice, it’s boiling around him.\nNYSSA: The connections are decaying. Destroying the ganglia must have severed the binding force.\nDOCTOR: (RECOVERING) Thank you. Turlough, are you all right?\nTURLOUGH: I’m feeling better than you look, at any rate.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well. I’m a little wiser for my bonding experience with the Morass system — but it’1ll be desperate for a new power\nDOCTOR: supply.\nNYSSA: Desperate? How can the system be desperate?\nDOCTOR: When it’s a living machine. Damaged. Senile. Deranged.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 109\nHOSS: Now what?\nKANCH: (OFF) Hoss? Is that you, Hoss?\nHOSS: Kanch, about time you woke up, get out from that stuff.\nKANCH: I’m trying. (FX: SQUELCH) What clobbered me?\nHOSS: I don’t know. Same thing as I shot down before, only hundreds of them — and more with the face of the boy’s friend...\nKANCH: Where’d they go?\nHOSS: I don’t know. There was a sound like something powering down. My gun’s charge pack must be on its last legs, too. We need to find your blaster and clear out. So get off your knees and start — [shifting]\nKANCH: I — I can’t, Hoss.\nHOSS: Come on, take hold of my — [hand]\nKANCH: It won’t let me go.\nHOSS: It’s just sludge, slush.\nKANCH: It’s not. It’s moving. Agh! It’s biting!\nHOSS: Take my hand, come on —\nHOSS: (FX: KANCH CRIES OUT AS THE SLUSH PULLS HIM AWAY WITH A VIOLENT JERK — HEAVY DRAGGING NOISE)\nKANCH: Hoss! It’s taking me!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 110\nHOSS: No! (FX: FIRES LASERS) Let go of him! Bring him back. Bring him back!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 111\nTEGAN: Deela... do you hear that?\nDEELA: Those things again..? No, I can’t take it.\nDEELA: (DEELA TRIES TO RUN BUT TEGAN HOLDS ONTO HER HAND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY )\nTEGAN: (STRUGGLING) You can’t just run off, Deela.\nDEELA: Let go of my hand!\nTEGAN: Calm down. If you run blindly, who knows what you’1ll run into —\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Tegan!\nTEGAN: Doctor! It’s all right, Deela — look who’s made it!\nDOCTOR: (AUDIBLY WEAKENED) Just about.\nTEGAN: You look terrible.\nNYSSA: We barely got the Doctor free in time.\nTURLOUGH: Deela, are you all right?\nDEELA: Just scared. I— I’m fine now.\nTEGAN: (KNOWING) Now Turlough’s here.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor — this is Deela, a friend. Kidnapped like I was.\nDOCTOR: How do you do. Tell me — why were you brought here?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 112\nTEGAN: It’s Turlough’s palace.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) Yours?!?\nTURLOUGH: Not really. It belonged to my family, once.\nDEELA: A man called Rennol needs us both here together to unlock some treasure.\nDOCTOR: What treasure?\nTURLOUGH: We don’t know what. Apparently it’s held in a dimensional vault.\nDOCTOR: Yes of course. The treasure house...\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Treasure house?\nDOCTOR: That’s how the Morass thinks of it. It’s connected to it through the ice crystals growing out of — and into — the rock.\nTEGAN: What’s this Morass?\nDOCTOR: A sentient security system installed centuries ago to defend that treasure — and in so doing, the planet.\nTEGAN: Then that’s the reason no-one else lives here — the Morass won’t let them?\nDEELA: It fits...\nDEELA: NYSSA3: What fits?\nDEELA: Nothing. Just something my father thought.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR: In any case, when we crash-landed here the gravity wells sent force-energy down through the planet’s crust — enough to activate the Morass and put it on a war footing.\nTEGAN: It thought we were attacking?\nDOCTOR: Seems it can’t distinguish between an accidental impact and a true bombardment. Not any more. Somehow the nature of the treasure-house was altered a long time ago — and the Morass was damaged in the process...\nTURLOUGH: (TO SELF) My great-grandfather, installing the DNA match...\nDOCTOR: (HASN'T HEARD) It’s confused.

Oh, Rennol.\nRENNOL: You and me, sweetest.\nDEELA: Alone at last.\nRENNOL: (BREAKING OFF KISS) Deela, I spoke to Hoss. The security system had got Kanch. She was trapped. I was so worried.\nDEELA: About me — or the plan?\nRENNOL: We’ve put so much into this. If Kanch and Hoss are dead, that only makes cheating them easier. But what about Turlough — is he safe?\nDEELA: (ANXIOUS) I hope so.\nRENNOL: Oh?\nDEELA: (RECOVERING) For the sake of the plan. He’s back with his friends now...\nRENNOL: They weren’t dead?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 117\nDEELA: By now, who knows? I tried to talk Turlough out of going. Then I dropped my scarf by the hidden door for Hoss and Kanch to find — but when I saw they couldn’t get me out... I didn’t know what to do. So I came to find you. Oh, it’s so horrible in there. The security system, it’s so.. so alien. Evil.\nRENNOL: You should’ve stuck with Turlough. If he dies in there...\nDEELA: He can’t... He mustn’t.\nRENNOL: (SLOWLY) For the sake of the plan.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 118\nNYSSA: (TO STOP) Turlough, wait. (BEAT) I thought I heard something?\nTURLOUGH: The Morass could be coming to life any moment. We need to move.\nTURLOUGH: Why did you come with me?\nNYSSA: No-one should have to go through these tunnels alone.\nTURLOUGH: I thought perhaps Tegan had... told you things. About what happened after you left us. I thought you didn’t trust me.\nNYSSA: All of that was a long time ago for me. I trust you, Turlough. I think I always did.\nTURLOUGH: (AFFECTED) Yes, well. Trust is one thing. To rely on me, another.\nNYSSA: Why do you think Deela ran?\nTURLOUGH: She was terrified. She hasn’t seen much away from her own system.. (SIGHS) My world went to war with itself. I was forced to participate in that war.\nNYSSA: You must have seen some terrible things.\nTURLOUGH: My mother was killed. My father and brother were forced to run who-knows-where. I was the lucky one. An exile on a backward planet. But Deela was spared all that. Her father was on the ‘right’ side. He was always so protective. Smothering... (STOPS HIMSELF) This tunnel leads back to the palace. Deela knows where she’s going.\nNYSSA: And this Rennol will be waiting...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 119\nTEGAN: For heaven’s sake, Hoss, we need to be working together!\nHOSS: You’1ll do as I say.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we should get to know each other a little, check who’s really best qualified to give the orders. I’m the Doctor, I’ma Time Lord — this is Tegan, from Earth...\nHOSS: You think this is funny?\nDOCTOR: Not at all. But you seem to think this situation is something you can solve with a gun — and it’s not. I can assure you the Morass won’t accept one of us in place of Kanch. It doesn’t judge us as individuals — we simply represent a threat to the treasure it’s protecting.\nHOSS: And how would you know so much?\nTEGAN: Because he’s been a part of it.\nDOCTOR: It wanted my life energy as a power supply. Just as it now wants Kanch to take my place.\nHOSS: Then they’ve taken him because of you. It’s your fault.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, splendid reasoning! It’s our fault for coming after Turlough when you abducted him. Our fault that the ship that took us here was too easy a target for your murderous friend. Our fault you forced us into a crash-landing and instigated this whole chain of events!\nHOSS: You got away from it. We can get Kanch away from it too.\nDOCTOR: No. The Morass learns, even in its decrepit condition; it scans and absorbs. It will have analysed the way I was released and it won’t let it happen again.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 120\nTEGAN: Quiet — it’s coming!\nDOCTOR: Backs to the wall.\nHOSS: (SOTTO) Kanch. I see Kanch, in the body of that thing!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) It’s smothered him. He’s been absorbed.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) It’s horrible. Like — I don’t know, jelly!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) That’s the raw stuff of the Morass.\nTEGAN: It’s OK, it’s gone. (STEPPING AWAY FROM WALL) So you’re telling me that’s the same stuff those facsimiles were made of?\nDOCTOR: The Morass can scan the enemy and create duplicates in these alcoves. It sends them into the enemy ranks to create confusion and delay.\nTEGAN: But Hoss was shooting them down like fish in a barrel.\nHOSS: They dissolve, go to pieces with a single blast. If we go after it, find its weak spot and attack again...\nDOCTOR: Don’t you listen? The Morass needs energy to function — it wanted you to fire at it. It absorbed the heat and light of your laser blasts. How much did you give it?\nHOSS: I.. I gave it the entire power pack. (FX: SHE DROPS THE GUN TO THE ICE) The gun’s empty.\nTEGAN: That’s a lot of power, right?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: When the Morass bonds with Kanch and uses him as an energy source, there’ll be nothing to stop it converting all that heat and light into strength. When it reforms the facsimiles they’1l be a hundred times more powerful.\nTEGAN: And we’ve got no way to defend ourselves. No way at all!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 122\nRENNOL: (OFF, THROUGH DOORS) You realise one of us will have to go into the catacombs to find Turlough.\nDEELA: (OFF, THROUGH DOORS) Don’t make me go back, Rennol.\nDEELA: [RENNOL: (OFF, THROUGH DOORS) Don’t go to pieces, Deela. There’s too much at stake. ]\nDEELA: [DEELA: (OFF, THROUGH DOORS) I... I must just rest first. ]\nDEELA: [RENNOL: (OFF, THROUGH DOORS) Rest later. Business now. ]\nTURLOUGH: (STOPPING, LOW) Nyssa, listen. That’s Deela. Rennol’s got her.\nNYSSA: (LOW) If we can only talk to him, convince him we’re all in danger...\nTURLOUGH: (LOW) He won’t listen. And he’s armed. Perhaps we should be too.\nNYSSA: (LOW) I don’t follow.\nTURLOUGH: (LOW) Look. Mounted on the wall.\nNYSSA: (LOW) A ceremonial scabbard?! And what has Rennol got?\nTURLOUGH: (LOW) Some sort of laser pistol. But if we push over the suit of armour outside the doors here, Rennol will come to investigate and then...\nNYSSA: (LOW) You whack him with the scabbard.\nTURLOUGH: Deep breath, and — PUSH!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 123\nDEELA: What was that?\nRENNOL: I.. I’11 go and see. (FX: FOLLOW HIM AS HE CROSSES TO DOOR) It could be Hoss or —\nTURLOUGH: (HEFTYING SCABBARD) .. or me!\nRENNOL: Turl—[aaaah!] (FX: TURLOUGH CLOBBERS HIM WITH SCABBARD, PISTOL DROPS)\nDEELA: (RUNNING FORWARD; SEES) You?!?\nNYSSA: Are you all right, Deela?\nTURLOUGH: Rennol’s not out. Deela, get his gun.\nDEELA: Of course. (SCOOPS IT UP)\nRENNOL: (GROGGY) Deel1a...?\nDEELA: (PASSING GUN) Here. You dropped your pistol.\nNYSSA: 3: Deela!\nTURLOUGH: I don’t understand. —\nRENNOL: Thank you, Deela. (GETTING UP) Don’t move, either of you. I will use this if I have to.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 124\nTURLOUGH: Deela, you gave him his gun back, are you mad? (NO ANSWER) Deela?\nRENNOL: Oh, she’s mad alright, Turlough. Mad about me.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Hoss — we must get after Turlough. We need his knowledge of the tunnel layout. There must be a physical link between the Morass and this treasure it safeguards — a confluence of the power supply, the junction of this world and the Palace above. If we can find a way to uncouple them, the Morass will lose its purpose.\nHOSS: You mean with nothing to protect, it’1ll stop fighting?\nDOCTOR: I hope so.\nTEGAN: Can’t we just leave in the flyers, like Turlough said?\nDOCTOR: We can’t just abandon Kanch, whatever he’s done.\nHOSS: You’re serious?\nTEGAN: He’s the Doctor. (SIGHS) OK — so how do we find this ‘junction of worlds’ place?\nHOSS: You say you were a part of that thing, don’t you know?\nDOCTOR: It’s like a dream — slipping away.\nHOSS: Well, you don’t need the boy. I’ve got a map.\nDOCTOR: Show me.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 126\nNYSSA: How could you, Deela?\nDEELA: Don’t judge me, Nyssa. You don’t know what I’ve been through.\nTURLOUGH: I do, and I’m still judging you. You and Rennol.. you’re actually together?\nDEELA: Vizz—\nTURLOUGH: Tell me!\nRENNOL: We don’t have to tell you anything.\nDEELA: No. You should know. Rennol and me, we’re getting married. I... never thought I’d see you again, Vizz, and when I met Rennol..\nRENNOL: You sound like you’re apologising!\nDEELA: I’m explaining. My father took against Rennol.\nTURLOUGH: A rare lapse of bad taste.\nDEELA: He tried to block the engagement. Froze my credit accounts, blocked all assets...\nTURLOUGH: So you looked elsewhere for your dowry. And knew you’d have to trick the only idiot who could help you get it.\nDEELA: I.. Please, I know it looks bad, but — [really]\nTURLOUGH: (BITTER) But what? You suddenly realize you’ve made a terrible mistake? That it was me you wanted all along? That a teenage infatuation is worth more than money?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 127\nRENNOL: All right, enough of this. Deela, if these two got out of the catacombs, so can their friends. We don’t want to be outnumbered. Get back to the hidden entrance. Barricade it.\nNYSSA: If you seal them inside you’1ll be killing them!\nRENNOL: Do it, Deela. And quickly.\nDEELA: Why me?\nRENNOL: (SARDONIC) How can you watch Turlough when you can’t even look him in the eye?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: How did you come by this map, Hoss?\nHOSS: Rennol uploaded it to my comms-band.\nTEGAN: Pictures in the air? That’s amazing.\nHOSS: Where did you find this woman?\nDOCTOR: Er.. this doesn’t look like a map of the catacombs.\nHOSS: It’s part of a data bundle. Rennol sent me through a whole packet of — [things]\nDOCTOR: . Wait. What is that?\nHOSS: Oh. Wiring diagram. Rennol said it was to do with the dimensional vault, but Turlough didn’t recognise it.\nDOCTOR: Can you bring up the catacombs map as an overlay?\nHOSS: I suppose.\nTEGAN: Is it just me, or does that section look exactly the same?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The junction of worlds.\nTEGAN: That’s the join we need to break?\nDOCTOR: If we’re to sever the link between the Morass and the treasure it protects. Now, let me just work out the safest route...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 129\nRENNOL: Turlough, when Deela returns, I hope you’1l be reasonable. Time is against us. If you co-operate, just open the door to the Bubble — [and]\nTURLOUGH: It’s not “the Bubble” anymore. It’s just an empty space. A vault that’s been shut down.\nRENNOL: Open it up, and we can all share the treasure!\nNYSSA: What is this treasure, Rennol? Do you even know?\nTURLOUGH: He knows. Because Deela’s father knows — that’s where he got his “intelligence” on this place.\nRENNOL: Your ancestor was an ambassador to alien worlds — and a member of the Royal Court. By the time the Arar-Jecks had fought their way to Trion borders, he’d done a deal with various neutral powers, to give hin...\nNYSSA: . “special protection”?\nRENNOL: Exactly. He offered the vault as a hiding place for the Trion queen in case of attack or invasion. The entire regal entourage could shelter inside, leaving no heat traces, no life signs. Nothing.\nTURLOUGH: (INTRIGUED DESPITE HIMSELF) Vanishing clean off the enemy’s radar...\nNYSSA: So the invaders would deduce that the palace was empty, and the world deserted, and leave again.\nRENNOL: Or if they didn’t, the Morass — the security system in the catacombs — would activate. Programmed to kill all invaders and protect the people inside the vault.\nTURLOUGH: Buying them time to get off the planet.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 130\nRENNOL: The point is, Deela’s father found papers claiming that the Queen did hide here with her entourage. That they took certain treasures in with them, too. Treasures that the old ambassador agreed to store there in case of future incursions.\nTURLOUGH: But there’s nothing there!\nRENNOL: Think about it, Turlough. Your great-grandfather was a smuggler — by definition, a master of secret compartments.\nNYSSA: Why not hide one within another?\nRENNOL: Imagine, Turlough — the lost treasure hoard of the old Trion royals... What if it’s been there all this time?\nTURLOUGH: I see now why Deela’s father was so keen to ‘protect’ the palace. If he waits till the end of the war, I come back from exile, he puts me and Deela together here — and then he can pocket the lot.\nRENNOL: He’1ll get nothing. Wait ‘til Deela gets back — then you’1ll see.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 131\nHOSS: Doctor, you must have worked out a safe path by now.\nDOCTOR: There is no safe path! But if I could only concentrate, I might be able to discern a route that’s slightly less lethal than all the others...\nTEGAN: Leaving me to make polite conversation with the kidnapping reptile I brained a couple of hours back. Awkward, isn’t it?\nHOSS: I’m a mercenary. Shifting allegiances goes with the territory.\nTEGAN: I’m not sure that goes with the territory.\nHOSS: What doesn’t?\nTEGAN: There, by your feet. Some miniature gizmo. Didn’t see it till it caught the light from that map thing.\nHOSS: (STOOPS TO PICK UP) Looks to be a sub-space transmitter.\nTEGAN: For communicating? It’s so small.\nHOSS: (FX: SMALL BLIP) There’s only one call sign in the memory.\nTEGAN: Whose?\nHOSS: Let’s find out.\nHOSS: (FX: COMMS ACTIVATES — SHOULD MATCH NOISE OF RENNOL’S COMMUNICATOR IN SCENE 3)\nHOSS: Hello? (PAUSE) Hello?\nHOSS: RENNOL [SYNTHETICALLY DISGUISED, AS DEELA’S WAS]: Deela? What’s keeping you?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL)\nTEGAN: They’re asking for Deela?! That thing must be hers.\nTEGAN: RENNOL [SYNTHETICALLY DISGUISED]: Deela? What’s wrong?\nHOSS: (QUIETLY) That’s Rennol. It’s got to be.\nTEGAN: What?\nHOSS: (INTO COMMS) Rennol?\nHOSS: Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 133\nRENNOL: (VOICE NO LONGER DISGUISED, OF COURSE) Deela? Who is this?\nRENNOL: HOSS [SYNTHETICALLY DISGUISED]: (VOICE DISGUISED) Who’d you think? (FX: BLEEP! AND HOSS’S VOICE IS NORMAL) I’m taking the signal off scrambler. Does that help?\nRENNOL: Hoss!\nHOSS: I warned you what would happen if you tried to play me, Rennol.\nNYSSA: That was careless of you, Rennol.\nTURLOUGH: (GLOATS) Very careless.\nRENNOL: (TROUBLED) Shut up.\nDEELA: All right, I pushed a big display case in front of the entrance to the catacombs, that ought — [to keep them inside]\nRENNOL: You little idiot!\nDEELA: What? (BEAT) It’s a really heavy one.\nRENNOL: I hope so. Because if Hoss gets out you’1l be killed right here. You dropped the comms-link!\nDEELA: What...? (FEELS FOR IT) It was fixed to my arm, hidden by my sleeve. It must’ve come loose.\nRENNOL: Obviously! She called me. I thought it was you. I thought she must be dead.\nNYSSA: We’1ll all be dead if we don’t help the Doctor stop the Morass!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 134\nTEGAN: I don’t understand — I thought Rennol kidnapped Deela, held her prisoner.\nHOSS: “Locked up” on a ship — with a direct link on scrambler so she could speak to him whenever, even in confinement. He must've worked out I had a tap on his regular comms band, so he used another to talk to her. I knew he was pulling something.\nTEGAN: But why bother to trick you? Rennol and Deela could have hired you together?\nHOSS: Isn’t it obvious? They wanted us to think Deela was a spineless brat, no threat — so they could cheat us once we’d got the treasure. Plus, your friend Turlough might have seen through her act, if we’d all been in on the game. Too clever for his own good, that one.\nTEGAN: You’re telling me — most of the time. Poor Turlough, he really likes her. When I get my hands on her...\nHOSS: Join the queue. I’11 kill them both!\nDOCTOR: (PIPING UP) Kill who?\nTEGAN: Doctor, did you not hear any of that?\nDOCTOR: I told you, I was concentrating.\nTEGAN: Deela and Rennol are working together. They duped Turlough so he and Deela could do the kiss thing and open the vault...\nDOCTOR: (PUZZLED) Kiss?\nHOSS: The boy rigged the opening mechanism of that pocket dimension so only the two of them kissing could open it.\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFUL) Did he indeed...?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 135\nTEGAN: Tremors.\nDOCTOR: The Morass is starting to revive. (SETTING OFF) Come on — we have to reach that power feed before it’s too late!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 136\nNYSSA: I’m telling you, Rennol — the Morass is gaining strength.\nDEELA: She’s right, Rennol. It lives in the tunnels.\nNYSSA: It doesn’t live there. The tunnels are where it grows until it’s ready to come out.\nTURLOUGH: The point is, any time now it’s going to attack!\nRENNOL: I’ve heard it grumbling in its sleep for weeks. I suppose my arrival, my presence here, must have stirred it.\nDEELA: We have to end this now.\nTURLOUGH: Suits me!\nRENNOL: Very well. Turlough, Deela, stand by the fireplace.\nTURLOUGH: (CROSSING TO DEELA) Well, we all know what comes next.\nRENNOL: Deela, I don’t need to encourage you to kiss your childhood sweetheart, do I?\nDEELA: Don’t be jealous, Rennol, there’s no— [need]\nRENNOL: Let’s get this over with. Kiss him.\nDEELA: ViZz...?\nRENNOL: (SNAPS) His name is Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: And who are you, Deela? Who did you become?\nDEELA: You were always the clever one. You tell me. (KISSES HIM)\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 137\nRENNOL: Finally.\nNYSSA: It’s opening. The vault’s opening!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP) The tunnel ought to split just around this corner... Yes!\nHOSS: Forks left and right.\nTEGAN: Which way do we want?\nDOCTOR: To the left.\nTEGAN: And that’s where we’ll find the spot where this whole catacomb- circuit thing sends power through to Turlough and Deela’s Bubble. Right?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. At the end of a cul-de-sac.\nHOSS: And when we get there, we destroy it how? We’ve no weapons, remember.\nDOCTOR: That comms-unit you say is Deela’s — it has a signal scrambler, mm? Press it up against the circuit at full power and it should be enough to disrupt the feed — at least for a while.\nTEGAN: What will disrupting its feed do?\nDOCTOR: With luck, give me time and opportunity to do a little rewiring up above. I only hope I’m right about the nature of that pocket dimension...\nTEGAN: What about it?\nDOCTOR: No time to explain now, Tegan. You and Hoss must get to that junction box. Carefully.\nHOSS: While you slope off to the palace and safety?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: Hardly that. You want to save Kanch? This is the only way.\nTEGAN: Listen to that.\nDOCTOR: The Morass is getting up to speed with the situation faster than I’d hoped.\nTEGAN: Footsteps this time. Facsimiles?\nDOCTOR: Must be coming to stop us. They’re strong enough to go anywhere now, above or below. Nowhere is safe.\nTEGAN: We’d better get going. But do we know how much power is in this communicator? Will the Morass feed on that too?\nDOCTOR: Hmm. It’s possible. Best if we can synchronise our actions.\nTEGAN: But how will we know when you’re ready to do whatever it is you need to do?\nHOSS: Rennol’s got a communicator.\nDOCTOR: If I can find him, I’1ll do my best to get hold of it. Good luck. (HE SPRINTS AWAY)\nTEGAN: (CALLING AFTER) You too, Doctor.\nHOSS: Come on, Tegan. Let’s finish this.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole\nDEELA: (BREATHES) Vizz, look. Our bubble...\nTURLOUGH: Just as we left it.\nDEELA: The blankets, the books...\nRENNOL: (FINAL) Page 140\nRENNOL: Deela! (CROSSES TO HER) Take the mass detector, get inside the vault and find out where that treasure is.\nNYSSA: A mass detector? You thought of everything.\nRENNOL: Obviously the treasure isn’t in plain sight, or these two would have seen it. (BEAT) Deela, get on with it!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 141\nDEELA: I’d forgotten what it was like, coming here.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIETLY) I hadn’t.\nRENNOL: Well, Turlough. The vault is open. The treasure secured. I\nRENNOL: don’t need you any more.\nDEELA: Rennol, no. You promised you wouldn’t hurt him.\nNYSSA: I think you’ve done that already.\nNYSSA: (FX: MASS DETECTOR BEGINS BLEEPING — LIKE GEIGER COUNTER REGISTERING )\nRENNOL: (STARTING FORWARD) The mass detector. There’s something there!\nNYSSA: Definitely something. Look at those readings!\nRENNOL: (SLOWLY) I was right. It’s all paid off! All the waiting... the planning... Pass me the detector, Deela.\nDEELA: What are you going to do?\nRENNOL: Change the frequency field. After all these hundreds of years, let’s bring the riches into the light!\nDEELA: (STUNNED) No!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 142\nNYSSA: That’s it? That’s your treasure?\nRENNOL: Shut up. Shut up!\nTURLOUGH: Your great treasure. Your magnificent hoard. (KICKS PILE OF BRIC-A-BRAC) All of it smashed! Broken!\nNYSSA: (SIFTING JUNK THROUGH FINGERS) More than that. These things have been pulverised. Jewellery. Sculpture. Paintings.\nDEELA: All ruined.\nRENNOL: Ruined...!\nNYSSA: Ugh — there are bones in here, too. Skeletons!\nTURLOUGH: From the way this one’s dressed... and the hole in the ribcage... I’d say this one used to be my smuggling great-grandfather.\nNYSSA: He had access to the Vault?\nTURLOUGH: The entry coder was keyed to his DNA long before Deela and I came along.\nNYSSA: It’s just — the man we saw in the ice was dressed the same way.\nRENNOL: The smugglers knew about the treasure?\nTURLOUGH: Clearly.\nDEELA: But why would they smash it? Why didn’t they take it?\nNYSSA: I don’t think they did this. These beautiful things have been trampled and crushed. I think the Morass destroyed them.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 143\nRENNOL: Don’t be ridiculous! The Morass exists to protect the treasure.\nNYSSA: What if the treasure was never possessions at all — but the people the vault was built for!\nTURLOUGH: (REALISES) The queen and her entourage. Of course!\nNYSSA: And later, your great-grandfather. Once he fixed it so his DNA became the key to open the vault, he was to be protected.\nRENNOL: Well, his protectors didn’t do much of a job, did they? He’s dead!\nTURLOUGH: Blasted through the chest, yes. But before that he must have set the Morass on a war footing. Too late to save him, but it came for his killers...\nDEELA: And the treasure was trampled in the struggle?\nNYSSA: These things would have meant nothing to the Morass.\nDEELA: But we do, Vizz.\nTURLOUGH: That’s why we were able to charge through the facsimiles.\nDEELA: (REALISING) They only grabbed for Tegan.\nNYSSA: And it’s why you could reach into the Morass ice to reach the\nNYSSA: ganglia, Turlough, when I couldn't...\nRENNOL: What are you talking about?\nNYSSA: Turlough and Deela, Rennol — only their DNA can open the vault!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS) .. Ergo, Turlough and Deela are the treasure the Morass is programmed to protect.\nRENNOL: (TURNING) Who—?!\nRENNOL: TURLOUGH & NYSSA: Doctor!\nRENNOL: Don’t move. (TO DEELA) Deela, I thought you said you blocked the way out of the catacombs?\nDEELA: I did!\nDOCTOR: The display case against the door was shaken loose by those tremors you must have felt. The Morass forms its facsimiles violently — and they stay that way.\nNYSSA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: There’s an army of facsimiles on their way here to protect Turlough and Deela — by killing the rest of us.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 145\nHOSS: This must be it, then.\nTEGAN: The junction of worlds. If the Morass comes for us here, we’re trapped.\nHOSS: Look at the power lines in the roof.\nTEGAN: Like roots. Roots growing for hundreds of years.\nTEGAN: (FX: WE HEAR DISTANT FOOTSTEPS AND CALLS OF FACSIMILES AS\nBEFORE: SUITABLE LINES FOR THIS AND SUBSEQUENT ‘MORASS ARMY’ SCENES NOTED IN APPENDIX)\nHOSS: Those facsimile things... they’re coming for us.\nTEGAN: Get that communicator ready. (TO SELF) Come on, Doctor... give us a sign.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SIZZLES AS DOCTOR, TURLOUGH, NYSSA, DEELA AND RENNOL EXIT THE BUBBLE)\nDOCTOR: (RE-ENTERING HALL) Turlough, Deela, I need that Vault deactivated.\nTURLOUGH: You have a plan?\nDOCTOR: I have a wild hope at any rate.\nRENNOL: No! Nobody move!\nDEELA: Rennol, you heard the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Put down the gun, Rennol. I need to see the Vault controls.\nRENNOL: (CRACKING) I put the last of my money into setting all this up. Hired spaceships, mercenaries...\nDOCTOR: And got at least one person killed on Vektris when Turlough was kidnapped.\nNYSSA: All because of your greed.\nRENNOL: How was I to know that would happen?\nDOCTOR: Now you’1ll die too, unless you put down the gun and let me get to the Vault controls.\nRENNOL: You’re trying to trick me...\nRENNOL: Arrgh!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 147\nDEELA: (FX: RUSHING OVER) Rennol? (CHECKS) He’s out cold. How did he jerk through the air like that?\nNYSSA: That was me. And this — generator tube, I think. It was on the floor.\nTURLOUGH: It came from your spaceship’s gravity well. Tegan used it earlier, a little more bluntly.\nDOCTOR: Good, good. Now! (EXAMINING VAULT CONTROLS) The Vault controls...\nDEELA: Can’t we tell it that you’re our friends, you’re not to be harmed?\nDOCTOR: This lash-up isn’t fully compatible. It’s left the Morass’s command cortex riddled with function errors.\nNYSSA: It’s been slowly driven insane. It can’t listen to anyone.\nTURLOUGH: We didn’t know... how could we have known?\nDOCTOR: I need to get to work. Turlough, Deela, I need you to shut down the Vault — if you wouldn’t mind...?\nDOCTOR: (TURLOUGH AND DEELA PERFORM A PERFUNCTORY KISS. INVERSE ACTIVATION FX AS VAULT POWERS DOWN)\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDEELA: VizZz...\nTURLOUGH: Don’t touch me.\nDEELA: You've got to believe me, since seeing you again...\nTURLOUGH: Don’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FROM CORRIDOR, WE HEAR THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, REPEATED PHRASES OF FACSIMILES, AS BEFORE)\nTURLOUGH: Listen. The Morass is coming.\nNYSSA: (SHUDDERS) So many...\nDOCTOR: Turlough, Deela, stand in the doorway. The facsimiles won’t try to hurt you. Nyssa, you must use the generator tube to keep them out until I can finish rewiring the system.\nNYSSA: But the generator’s almost out of power.\nDOCTOR: It’s all we’ve got! Now, where’s Rennol’s communicator...?\nDEELA: (PASSING COMMUNICATOR) Here.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (FX: BLEEP!)\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MORASS FACSIMILES APPROACHING IN B/G, REPEATED PHRASES AS BEFORE )\nDOCTOR: (VIA COMMS) Tegan? Are you receiving me?\nTEGAN: (INTO COMMS) Doctor, thank heavens. The Morass is on to us. Dozens of those dead-eyed monsters. They’ve got us trapped!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: (INTO COMMS) Stand by, Tegan. Won’t be long now. Doctor out. (FX: COMMS BLEEP) (MUTTERS) Not enough time, not nearly enough.\nNYSSA: Doctor? What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Disconnect the dimensional vault from the security circuit, so the Morass has nothing to guard — and therefore no further purpose.\nNYSSA: But if it’s been driven mad, if it’s not acting rationally...\nDOCTOR: Then it’1ll slaughter us all.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORASS NOW AT THE DOOR, REPEATING SNATCHES OF CATACOMB- SPEECH )\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING BACK) Doctor, they’re here!\nDOCTOR: Hold them back! I need more time to sever the circuit.\nDEELA: (TO MORASS) You know me! Back! Get back-!!!\nDEELA: (FX: SMASHING WINDOW TO ONE SIDE. MORE MORASS FACSIMILES CLAWING THEIR WAY IN)\nTURLOUGH: Now they’re coming through the broken windows!\nNYSSA: (RUNNING OVER TO WINDOW) Don’t worry, I’ve still got the generator tube —\nNYSSA: There! I increased the gravity.\nDOCTOR: (WORKING FRANTICALLY AT CONTROLS) The circuit’s not responding. Oh, for my sonic screwdriver...\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 151\nTEGAN: (VIA COMMS) Doctor? What’s keeping you?!?\nDOCTOR: (INTO COMMS) Tegan, keep standing by.\nDOCTOR: DEELAs: Can’t we all hide in the Bubble?\nDOCTOR: (WORKING) I can’t reopen it until I’ve finished the rewiring. And we can hardly abandon Tegan and Hoss.\nNYSSA: This generator tube’s almost completely drained.\nTURLOUGH: If Deela and I could get off-world, Doctor, might it not have the same effect as removing the vault? With nothing to protect, the Morass would fall dormant.\nDOCTOR: In its current condition, that’s possible.\nDEELA: It’s no use. We’d never get past those things and back to the spaceship before they’d killed you all.\nRENNOL: (GETTING UP) Then again — there’s more than one way to leave the planet.\nTURLOUGH: Decided to rejoin the party, have you, Rennol?\nDEELA: Rennol? You can’t be serious.\nRENNOL: Please, Deela. You and Turlough would be sacrificing yourselves for the greater good.\nTURLOUGH: Deela, come back here with me, he means it. He’1ll kill you.\nDOCTOR: (STILL WORKING) Rennol, don’t be a fool. I must complete the severance. You’re wasting everyone’s time.\nRENNOL: You can’t help us! You only talk!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL)\nNYSSA: 3: More of them!\nTURLOUGH: Then use the tube!!!\nNYSSA: Power’s dead, sorry.\nDOCTOR: (FRANTIC WORK) Nearly there...\nDEELA: Rennol, please — point the gun at the\nRENNOL: Deela. Sweet Deela. If you just leave\nDEELA: You won’t fire. You wouldn’t hurt me...\nTURLOUGH: Deela!!\nNYSSA: Rennol, what have you — [done]\nDOCTOR: . Done it! (INTO COMMS) Tegan, Hoss —\nDOCTOR: Morass, not us!\nDOCTOR: this world...\nDOCTOR: I know you...\nDOCTOR: Page 152\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 153\nDOCTOR: (VIA COMMS) .. put the scrambler unit up against the fronds in\nDOCTOR: the ceiling.\nTEGAN: Finally.\nHOSS: You heard the man. Switch on!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 154\nDEELA: (DYING) Vizz? Are you there, Vizz?\nDOCTOR: Rennol! Give me the gun... It’s over.\nTURLOUGH: I’m here, Deela. Nyssa, help me!\nNYSSA: She’s been shot in the chest. I don’t think we can help her.\nRENNOL: Get away from her, Turlough. (BEAT) I said, get away!\nDOCTOR: And I said - It’s over.\nRENNOL: No! The Morass, it’s still coming! We’ve got to kill the boy too, don’t you see?!?\nDEELA: (DYING) Can we go back, Vizz? Back to our bubble...?\nNYSSA: The Vault — it’s open!\nRENNOL: It’s safe in there. It’s safe!!! (BOLTS FOR IT)\nDOCTOR: No, Rennol! Don’t go in, you don’t understand—!\nRENNOL: (SLIGHTLY OFF, SLIGHTLY MUFFLED) Safe!!! I’m safe-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MORASS RASPS ITS LAST. ITS FACSIMILES FALL APART, AS EARLIER)\nTURLOUGH: Deela. Stay with me. Deela!!!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Turlough.\nNYSSA: So sorry.\nTURLOUGH: (HOARSE) Sorry? (THEN HARDER) Why are you sorry? She’s dead, isn’t she?\nTEGAN: (VIA COMMS) Doctor? Are you there? It’s all gone quiet down here.\nHOSS: (VIA COMMS) The facsimiles have melted to slush. Now what about Kanch?\nDOCTOR: (INTO COMMS) Hoss, Tegan, wait there. I’1ll come to get you — then we can try to revive Kanch.\nHOSS: Try? But the Morass is dead. Kanch will be all right...?\nDOCTOR: I.. There may be some ill-effects.\nHOSS: I was after a change of career... (SNORTS) Nursemaid wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. (BEAT) Hoss out.\nNYSSA: Doctor. You managed to sever the power link between the vault and the catacombs?\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR: I reversed it. Routed the Morass’s power supply into the vault and switched the Vault to encompass Kanch instead — isolating him from the system.\nNYSSA: The Morass couldn’t cope with disruption on that scale?\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nNYSSA: But how did you create a power supply in the Vault?\nDOCTOR: Rennol supplied it just by running inside.\nNYSSA: So he became the battery, instead of Kanch?\nDOCTOR: I was going to enter the Vault myself. I might just have been able to disentangle myself from the system shutdown in the aftermath. But Rennol, I’m afraid...\nTURLOUGH: Then it’s over.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I, er — I’d better find Tegan and Hoss. (HE LEAVES. )\nTURLOUGH: What do you think, Nyssa? Is Rennol dead? Or is he still trapped inside?\nNYSSA: I hope he’s dead.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. FROM OFF, HOSS’S SPACESHIP LAUNCHING, AS IN PART ONE )\nDOCTOR: Ah, Tegan. There go Hoss and Kanch.\nTEGAN: Good riddance.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. Experiences like they’ve had today can change people.\nTEGAN: Well, I don’t think Kanch will ever be the same again. Which can only be an improvement.\nDOCTOR: (REPROVING) Tegan!\nTEGAN: All right. Just so long as they don’t go back to Vektris for their rest cure. (BEAT) Can we get going now?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The TARDIS interior should have stablised. Although I rather think the console needs a complete overhaul...\nTEGAN: I know how it feels.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’d better familiarise myself with the controls of Rennol’s flyer. (PAUSE) Will Turlough be joining us, do you think?\nTEGAN: Nyssa’s gone to see.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 158\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Turlough? We’1ll be going soon.\nTURLOUGH: Will we... (PAUSE) You know, Deela and I used to lie in that vault and talk about the future. Dreaming what we’d do when we got away. When we were free.\nNYSSA: Now that I’m older, I don’t like to talk about the future so much. But I still dream about it. (PAUSE) I have another life now, Turlough. People I’m close to, who are waiting for me. And yet here I am.. back travelling. Back being free.\nTURLOUGH: The future didn’t turn out quite as you planned.\nNYSSA: Not quite. And you can’t turn back the clock, not even with the Doctor. But there’s always another future out there, Turlough — that’s what the Doctor gives us. Hope for the future, when you’re ready to find it.\nNYSSA: By the way... the Doctor doesn’t know anything about your old life on Trion. And Tegan won’t tell. You can move on with your secrets safe. Till you choose to share them.\nTURLOUGH: I’m never sharing anything. Ever again.\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 159\nTEGAN: (WALKING UP) Hi, Nyssa. I was just on my way to find you. Is Turlough coming?\nNYSSA: I think so. And I think we should let all that’s happened here... remain here.\nTEGAN: Freezing over.\nNYSSA: Like the catacombs. Like the palace.\nTEGAN: Like Turlough.\nTEGAN: END OF PART FOUR\nDOCTOR WHO: KISS OF DEATH by Stephen Cole (FINAL) Page 160\nAPPENDIX: LINES FOR ‘MORASS ARMY’ SCENES IN PARTS THREE & FOUR\nAPPENDIX: MORASS [SCENE 27]: Going to war footing.
