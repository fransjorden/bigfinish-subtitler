This is the story of a very powerful and foolish Time Lord, who did a terrible thing, and of the heroic Time Lord who discovered what he did, to his great horror... With me so far? Oh, before we start, could you do something for me? Just a little thing...\nMAVEN: SCENE 2: SOMEWHERE SEEMINGLY UNDEFINED. Atmosphere: echoey menace. Low hum. Again, it is not clear who is speaking until later.\nDALAND: What is their status, Vandekyrian?\nTARPOV: I have confirmation. They are coming, Lord Omega.\nTARPOV: DALAND And are they aware of what is to befall them?\nTARPOV: They suspect nothing.\nDALAND: Poor fools. They know nothing of the power of Omega yet. He assured, Vandekyrian. We\nDALAND: shall give them a demonstration they will never forget.\nDALAND: They laugh, wickedly, but it eventually runs out of steam - DALAND first.\nDALAND: (Abruptly actorly) I must say that was impressive.\nTARPOV: (Abruptly actorly too) Very good.\nDALAND: Can we do that again?

Atmos: excited babble of voices, mostly mature women. There is a speaker broadcasting to them, with ‘historic muzak’ going on under. FX: chime.\nSENTIA: (On speaker, sing-song) Ladies and gentlemen, if I can bring your attention to the windows on the left of the shuttle, you can see a small cluster of stars... It’s hard to believe, but Omega himself could very well have looked out of a window, a window very much like the one you're looking out of, and looked at those very stars, or a collection of stars very like them, as he very probably thought about the historic mission that he was about to undertake...\nSENTIA: (On speaker) Can I politely remind passengers not to use infra-temporal flash photography. The largest star system contains the planet Ullar, and the primitive tribes there believe that the lights they keep believe are angry gods breaking off bits of their sun - and they do tend to appease their gods in a variety of ways, none of them pleasant.

Just grass and trees, and it was always raining.\nGLINDA: Didn’t it, Mave? Rain. Always.\nMAVEN: Did it what?\nGLINDA: Rain. Always.\nMAVEN: It did?\nGLINDA: Yes. And all those old castle ruins.

Castles always seem to be on hills, they’re not very accessible.\nDOCTOR: I think they were probably designed with that intention.\nGLINDA: Well, it’s very rude, especially when you’ve spent all that money getting there. Luckily we\nGLINDA: found a nice little cafe that did pastries. Here’s a photo of Maven eating one. Look.\nDOCTOR: (Acidly) Well, at least your visit to the most beautiful planet in the universe wasn’t\nDOCTOR: completely wasted.\nGLINDA: No, you'll find these tours are much better. You can get a flavour of real history, and I hear the Prydonian’s Pantry at the end is very nice.\nSENTIA: (Over speaker) Attention, everyone. This is an important announcement! We are now entering the (theatrical edge of mystery in voice) Sector of Forgotten Souls.\nSENTIA: (Over speaker) This is the actual area of space where Omega finished his mission: to detonate the star of Jartus and give the Time Lords unlimited energy for their time travel... Of course, in this more enlightened era it seems an awful lot of effort to travel in time. We don’t like going into history, we much prefer Jolly Chronolidays to bring history to us, don’t we?\nSENTIA: (Over speaker) Now, as a lot of you may know, the mission went sadly wrong. Omega’s ship was caught in the gravitational field of the black hole he created, and it was lost. Awww.\nSENTIA: (Over speaker) There are many stories and superstitions about that ship. Legend has it that it was caught between universes, and once every hundred standard years the ghost of that ship appears in this very sector of space, in order to lure unwary travellers to their doom...\nGLINDA: Pardon me for saying so, dear, but aren’t you a bit young to go on one of these things?\nDOCTOR: Well I am pushing 900, actually.\nGLINDA: Even so... Still on the young side. I don’t think I’ve seen you before, have I? Actually, come to think of it, I don’t remember seeing you when we boarded.\nGLINDA: DOCTOR To tell you the truth, I’ve been keeping a low profile.\nGLINDA: Poor love. Bit of eggy belly? I can tell you’re not yourself just by looking at you. Don’t\nGLINDA: know what made you come on a tour like this, if you’re not used to space travel.\nDOCTOR: Well, actually, madam, I’m an old hand at space travel, and there is a very good reason\nDOCTOR: why I came on a tour like this-\nGLINDA: We came for the in-flight catering and the shopping.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m here because... I... I had this dream...\nGLINDA: Oh, yes...\nDOCTOR: Yes. I was on an antique sailing ship, moving silently through the waves, under a black\nDOCTOR: sky. The ship’s timbers were creaking softly, like it was muttering to itself. No, I tell a lie, it was muttering to itself, as if it had already gone insane with loneliness. A hooded figure was at the wheel. He tied it fast and bent towards me to speak to me. I could smell death on its breath, not a murderous stench but a smell of hopelessness, the smell of something that had been around for far far too long. It spoke to me,\nDOCTOR: with a voice like the rusty grinding of the last broken dock in the universe...\nGLINDA: (Hushed, awed) And what did it say to you?\nDOCTOR: (Normal, breaking the spell) It told me I needed a holiday.\nDOCTOR: GLINDA A holiday?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Of course, having dreams like that, no one has to be told twice.\nMAVEN: What’s he say?\nGLINDA: (Louder register) He says no one has to be told twice, dear!\nMAVEN: Oh, yes!\nSENTIA: (Over speaker) Attention, everyone, if you look out of the left-hand side you can just make\nSENTIA: out the... (the speaker starts to cut out. There is interference’) ... famed indigo moon of Kavelron, which is well\nSENTIA: 10\nSENTIA: known for it’s ...uty... began... anet... utiful sunsets... and the area where the... lanet... attacked by the... endahl... Id in a timeloo... Ladies... tlemen we seem to be hit by some galactic turbulence. There is no cause... alarm... Repeat... cause for alarm... (Suddenly out of tour guide’ mode) Oh, my... What’s that? It... can’t be!\nEX: Enormous sound, like a cross between a clap of thunder and fingers down a blackboard. Terrified babble of oldies.\nSENTIA: (Over speaker. Panic-stricken) Please do not panic... I’m sure it’... ust a localised disturb...\nGLINDA: I hope we don’t get hit by an asteroid... Not before we get to the-souvenir shop.\nDOCTOR: It’s not an asteroid, it’s a ship... (Off mic) Excuse me, ladies... Thanks for the chat. It’s\nDOCTOR: been... interesting.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 6: TOUR SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nDOCTOR: static =just like the speaker in the visitors’ area... Bleep - minor alarm.\nSENTIA: Someone’s left their seat. 6E’s empty... I’d better check.\nDALAND: (Over speaker) Probably just an old dear answering yet another call of nature. I tell you, the amount of times they go - we could take out the shuttle engines and use hydroelectric power.\nDOCTOR: (Off mic) Ah, there you are...\nSENTIA: Excuse me, this is a restricted area, you can’t - Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (On mic) Now I don’t want you to panic, but there’s a dimensional anomaly on your\nDOCTOR: doorstep, and if we don’t get it stabilised this whole place could end up a restricted area. But, by lucky chance, I know what this anomaly is, and you’re going to be terribly excited.\nSENTIA: I should explain, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Jane’s Book of Gallifreyan Vessels, chapter three, Omegan sunskippers. It’s Omega’s very own ship, the Eurydice... Turning up right on cue. Don’t worry. This kind of thing happens to me all the time. (Beat) You don’t seem very thrilled.\nDALAND: (Over speaker) Who’s there with you, Sentia? Who’s that?\nDOCTOR: Wait - I can hear voices...\nDALAND: (Over speaker) That’s me!\nDOCTOR: Shhh! Other voices!\nSENTIA: Oh, you mean these, Doctor?\nEX: SENTIA turns up the volume and we can hear the noise. It is SENTIA’S voice, saying the same things as relayed in the passenger section, still being broken up by static.\nDOCTOR: That’s a recording of you! I don’t understand...\nSENTIA: All will become clear, Doctor. I’ve just got to make an announcement to our passengers. If\nSENTIA: you'd like to accompany me...?\nSENTIA: SCENE 7: TOUR SHUTTLE PASSENGER SECTION.\nSENTIA: (On handheld microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you were not alarmed by the arrival of the ship on our starboard bow. It is in fact our interactive Heritage Centre fashioned like the Eurydice, Omega’s very own ship, appearing before us out of nowhere, in the same way as it probably would have done to all those other space travellers in the past. You can hear recordings of some of the more coherent witnesses inside the centre.\nSENTIA: 11\nSENTIA: leave their seats and shuffle out of the area.\nSENTIA: So, the automatic docking procedure seems to have finished. If you would like to make your way to the exit, your tour is about to begin. (Beat) Those in row C, the quicker you step over Mrs\nSENTIA: Ganymede and give her plenty of space, the sooner the medibot will be able to revive her.\nDOCTOR: I seem to have been hoodwinked.\nSENTIA: It’s just a refurbished space-station with invisibility shields, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Pooled by a clever copy. How embarrassing.\nSENTIA: It happens to us all sometimes. Shall we join the others?\nSENTIA: SCENE 8: AIRLOCK CORRIDOR - INTO HERITAGE CENTRE.\nDOCTOR: It’s a very convincing recreation.\nSENTIA: Not just a recreation of Omega’s ship. You see that piece of shrapnel behind that glass?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nSENTIA: That is a piece of the actual hull of a ship that could have been around at about the very same time as the Eurydice.\nDOCTOR: Really!\nSENTIA: As you can see we have spared no effort in giving our customers a true flavour of the\nSENTIA: legend of Omega.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well. (Cough. Sarcastic, but humouring) You can’t get more authentic than a piece from the actual hull of a ship that could well have been around at the same time as the Eurydice... It’s odd, though... I couldn't help but notice there are at least three passengers from races with time travel capability. I also noticed in your commentary that you said time travel was ‘too much effort’...?\nSENTIA: Oh, well, Past Perusals, the last company to offer time tours went bankrupt years ago. The novelty of seeing history first-hand actually wears off pretty quickly.\nDOCTOR: Does it really?\nDOCTOR: SENTIA The past isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. You can’t touch anything, it’s very dirty, frequently boring, and in almost all cases there’s no proper toilet facilities. Our company doesn’t bother with all that. In a survey conducted by Hyperspace Holidays magazine, 85 per cent of people questioned say they preferred our version of history to the real thing.\nDOCTOR: Well, I can see their point of view, but surely it’s better -\nDALAND: (Off mic. Booming declamatory) Hold! Go further at your peril! Be warned, if you enter here you will be in some danger, for in this place begins a perilous feat of stellar engineering!\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear...\nSENTIA: Sssh! (Her voice is raised - she is talking to DALAND as well as the assembled party - her manner is staged and heavily pre- scripted) Now, who could this be? No. It can’t be, can it?\nDALAND: (Booming) 1 am Omega, the first to conquer the great Vortex. I will be the shining star by which my brother Time Lords will navigate. I am destined to be the first Lord of Time! Welcome to my\nDALAND: stout ship, the Eurydice. Join me, as I journey into the void, and I unlock the mysteries of the universe...\nTARPOV: Lord Omega! I bring news from the sunskippers. They say conditions are most fair for our endeavour.\nTARPOV: SENTIA And who is this, Lord Omega?\nDALAND: Why it is my colleague and assistant, Vandekyrian, a fellow temporal scientist who hath\nDALAND: 12\nDALAND: helped me in my experiments. Tell me, does all go well with the stellar manipulator?\nTARPOV: Very well, my Lord, right well.\nDALAND: Good, well. You are a loyal and true friend, Vandekyrian, it is good that you are with me on this day.\nTARPOV: (Whispered aside) Little is Omega aware, my loyalty is to another. I have spoken to my Lord\nTARPOV: Rassilon, who now sits atop his Kasterboran throne. He is most concerned that Omega’s hearts beat in time to those of the people of Gallifrey. He thinks, ‘Mayhap Lord Omega he hast the ear of the Shabogans.’\nDALAND: Come, Vandekyrian, stand with me at the portal, let us look upon our future realm.\nTARPOV: (Aside) Future realm, indeed. My master fears for his own realm, he thinks that once his triumph is complete my Lord Rassilon will fall from favour.\nSENTIA: (Raised voice) There is a common consensus amongst historians that Rassilon indeed conspired to get rid of Omega, who was as loved on Gallifrey as a hero, as Rassilon was hated as a politician. To coin a phrase made famous by Professor Markil Shezion in his book Omega - The Prodigal Sun...\nTARPOV: (Losing the mannered acting) Not so, my lady, Rassilon was an innocent party in this. He was not privy to my machinations.\nSENTIA: (Thrown) Brm... Riiiight-\nSENTIA: TARPOV In truth it was my plan, and mine alone... I had to act to prevent a heinous act that\nSENTIA: would bring shame on the Time Lords, and make Rassilon’s face blush as dark as his Prydonian collar.\nSENTIA: (Getting annoyed) But surely, Vandekyrian, Rassilon conspired against Omega.\nTARPOV: Not so. I cannot stand by and let Lord Omega commit his terrible crime, the blood on his hands would be on mine and every Time Lord. Do you hear me, Omega!\nDALAND: (Thrown) Um... Yes?\nTARPOV: I am Vandekyrian! I am the conscience of the universe and I tell you to desist from this\nTARPOV: dark and shadowy path! Your black deeds will shroud us all!\nDALAND: Oh, will they? (Cough. Trying to think off the cuff) Peace, Vandekyrian, my friend, mayhap you are wrong about me. I wouldn’t get into such a tizz if I were you.\nSENTIA: Well, that’s enough from Vandekyrian. (With heavy emphasis) Omega...? Don’t you... er-\nDALAND: Oh, yes. Oh! Does anyone have anything that they want to ask of the great Lord Omega and his assistant Vandyk-\nSENTIA: Ahem...\nDALAND: Oh, right. Good idea. Just me. Anyone, got anything they want to ask Omega. (Pause) Anyone...? Anyone at all? Yes!\nGLINDA: (Off mic) Didn’t you play the randy priest in Hearts in Orbiton Channel thirty thousand and eight?\nGLINDA: SCENE 9: LATER ON THE HERITAGE CENTRE.\nTARPOV: (Bring up, off mic. Anguished) Like this vessel marked with my sabotage, I am a vessel marked with guilt, Lord Omega. See I have cut off mine own hand that I raised against you, and I place it before you as a symbol of remorse.\nDALAND: (Off mic) Your treachery spans more than a single palm, Vandekyrian. Your other hand also took a hand in your sabotage, and soI relieve that of you also.\nGLINDA: (Very off mic) Now that wasn’t very nice...\nDALAND: (Off mic) And those black hearts of yours did put you at Rassilon’s side and against me,\nDALAND: 13\nDALAND: so I pierce it with my sword.\nTARPOV: (Off mid) My lord! I die! (Choke) I am dead!\nDALAND: (Off mic) Vandekyrian, you were my loyal and trusted friend, once. I will place your hand in the stellar manipulator, so at least In death you will have a hand in our great endeavour.\nDALAND: (Off mic) See on the screen. The stellar manipulator has worked, the sun is no more, and already the black sun greedily feeds on my proud vessel, crippled by the black heart of Rassilon. So, Rassilon, you feared Omega’s fame, and showed me a danger which I had left unheeded. So different and yet so alike. We have both engineered the destruction of a star, and both of us... succeeded.\nSENTIA: (Off mid) Thank you, everyone, I hope you enjoyed it... If you’d just like to follow the hologram of Zagreus, he’ll guide you around the rest of the centre...\nZAGREUS: (Broad Scouse) All right, all right, everybody, I’m Zagreus, me, and I can tell you a great tale or two about them smart Time Lord guys, you just follow me, eh. Come on, come on, hurry along now...\nSENTIA: (On mic over ZAGREUS) So what did you think of our presentation, Doctor. Powerful, wasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Powerful... could be a word for it. Not too clear on this ‘heinous crime’ stuff.\nSENTIA: Ah... That wasn’t actually part of the presentation.\nDOCTOR: Oh, what a shame. I thought for a moment there you were confirming the legends about Omega’s cruelty.\nSENTIA: I’m sure these stories aren’t true. Omega was a hero. And heroes don’t let things like that happen.\nDOCTOR: Nicely put. You have a refreshingly uncluttered view towards history, as I’m already\nDOCTOR: painfully aware. Hmmm...\nSENTIA: (Icy) Yes, well, thank you for your input, Doctor. I thought you of all people might understand. If you wish to know more about Omega, there is a book section in the souvenir shop. There is also a visitors’ book in the reception area. (Away from mic) Do remember to leave your comments before\nSENTIA: you leave...\nSENTIA: SCENE 10: HERITAGE BOOKSHOP.\nROBOT: Attention! Attention! You have violated regulations for this section! Security protocols\nROBOT: have now been engaged!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no... Look, for the last time, leave me in peace!\nROBOT: My scanners observed you picking up the edition of Omega - The Prodigal Sun by Professor Markil Shezion, net price 14 drognas, 99 screebos.\nDOCTOR: I know I have. So what exactly?\nROBOT: You have been examining it for 2.36 minutes. Logic circuits dictate you wish to buy the book.\nDOCTOR: I happen to be browsing!\nROBOT: ‘Browsing’ - that word is not in my database.\nDOCTOR: Why did I know you were going to say that...? All right, fine, ’m buying the book. You do\nDOCTOR: take Alpha Centauri express, I take it?\nROBOT: That will do nicely, sir.\nROBOT: 14\nDOCTOR: You, my metal friend, are an electronic mugging machine.\nROBOT: Would you like to consider other related titles, sir?\nDOCTOR: No, I think ‘electronic mugging machine’ will quite suffice.\nERTIKUS: (A sort of softer version of Dr. David Starkey) Excuse me, have you just bought that book? Because if you have, waste of money. It’s balderdash.\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nERTIKUS: Oh, yes. Balderdash from start to finish. Pure guesswork on every page. That’s the\nERTIKUS: problem with old Shezion: he finds a free gift in his breakfast cereal, he thinks it’s evidence that Omega was a raging nymphomaniac with cannibalistic tendencies and a morbid fear of the colour green. As you\nERTIKUS: can guess, sir, from my professional envy, I’m another broadcaster and historian.\nDOCTOR: Broadcaster and historian. In that order?\nERTIKUS: I’m afraid so, these days. ‘Stuff the facts, Ertikus,’ the telly boys say. ‘History is the new soap opera, so we want the legends, and the more lurid your take on the legends, the better.’\nDOCTOR: Well... legends do have a grain of truth in them...\nERTIKUS: Grains of truth are like grains of sand. Make anything out of them, the tide comes and\nERTIKUS: washes them all away. And they get in your socks and make your feet itch, too. Facts, sir. The most basic facts tell me something about an individual. A name, for example. Take my name, Professor Vidor Ertikus. Profession, genealogy, identity. Couldn’t be simpler. It’s all there, isn’t it? Mr, er...\nDOCTOR: Doctor. Just Doctor.\nERTIKUS: Well, Doctor, I see history as a lighted candle, it illuminates all before it, and burns so brightly, that even people who-\nDOCTOR: (Joins in and finishes quote) ... close their eyes to it can see the mark it makes on their eyelids.\nERTIKUS: Oh, you’ve read my book?\nDOCTOR: No, just the blurb on the jacket. There’s a pile of them by the till. Well, more of a sculpture really. These robots have to do something to pass the time.\nERTIKUS: Would you like a copy? With my compliments. Collectors item this, I haven’t signed it yet.\nDOCTOR: (Reading) ‘Far from ushering the age of enlightenment, I believe there is a compelling case\nDOCTOR: to make that Omega was in fact, more of a dictator than Rassilon ever was...’ If I didn’t know better, this\nDOCTOR: stuff sounds a lot like conjecture, Professor...\nERTIKUS: Oh, yes, but completely different from old Shezion’s guesswork.\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes?\nERTIKUS: Oh, yes. This is my guesswork!\nDOCTOR: Very exciting title. (Reading) Omega - The Blackest Star of Them All\nERTIKUS: (Unenthusiastic) Yes it is, isn’t it? Publishers wanted it. They said it would sell. Didn’t work\nERTIKUS: though. The public can’t cope with history unless it’s on the telly with lots of actors dressed in silly\nERTIKUS: costumes. Philistines.\nERTIKUS: SCENE 11: ACTORS’ GREEN ROOM.\nDALAND: Typical. I’m Omega, one of the most important figures in time travel, and what questions do I get? ‘Do I buy my own costumes?’ ‘How much do I get an hour?’ ‘Weren’t you on Hearts in Orbit on\nDALAND: channel thirty thousand and eight?’ The public can’t cope with history unless it’s in some dusty little\nDALAND: book. Cretins.\nDALAND: iS\nTARPOV: But you were on Hearts in Orbit on channel thirty thousand and eight, weren’t you? I liked that, what happened to it?\nDALAND: (Airily) I don’t like to talk about it...\nTARPOV: Ah. I understand.\nDALAND: Killed by the network. Got cancelled to make way for a twenty-six-part history\nDALAND: documentary because, apparently, ‘History is the new soap opera.’ I was good in it though, wasn’t I?\nTARPOV: Marvellous.\nDALAND: Bless you. I won three awards, you know. But you know, Tarpov, funnily enough, I get more professional satisfaction from doing this. That’s why I do it. It’s the thrill of having an audience. I know today was disappointing, but the crowds we get here seem to be more appreciative, more receptive to the subtleties of performance.\nSENTIA: (Onto mic) Too blind and deaf to notice you overacting, more like.\nDALAND: Look at her, Tarpov, so elegant and refined. She was born to push waste trolleys around.\nSENTIA: (Straining) Well, I’m certainly used to dealing with rubbish. (FX: Waste disposal grinding. Then off. Going off mic) Tarpov, I would appreciate it if you stuck to the script in future, and didn’t mess around.\nTARPOV: Sorry, Sentia, I don’t know what came over me...\nDALAND: Don’t apologise, Tarpov. That, my dear, is what we call acting. In fact, to be more specific,\nDALAND: a tool of the actor’s, trade called ‘improvisation’.\nSENTIA: (Off mic) Really...\nDALAND: Take no notice, Tarpov, you were marvellous. And I loved that idea of workshopping the characters.\nTARPOV: Oh, thank you, it just came to me. I thought it might be useful.\nDALAND: Very good. It certainly helped you get into the role. What was that you said again, about the doodah of the universe? The bit about the path?\nTARPOV: Oh, that! I am Vandekyrian! I am the conscience of the universe!\nDALAND: That’s it. Superb. And spontaneous, too.\nTARPOV: I charge you to desist from this dark and shadowy path!\nDALAND: Now that line made the hairs on my neck stand on end...\nTARPOV: (Getting more worked up) Your deeds are as dark as the heart of the black hole you created. You will shame us all, murderous, guiltless-beast!\nDALAND: You've sold me. I don’t think you even need a prop. I don’t think you need to swing that metal bar around, you’re intimidating enough without it.\nTARPOV: Stop now, Omega! It is not too late!\nDALAND: Tarpov! Put the damn thing down! What are you doing?\nDALAND: (Screams) Tarpov!\nTARPOV: I am Vandekyrian! Conscience of the universe!\nTARPOV: 16\nTARPOV: SCENE 12: ANOTHER PART OF THE HERITAGE CENTRE.\nGLINDA: I must say, we really enjoyed the performance, it’s so nice to see history come alive before\nGLINDA: your very eyes. Wasn’t it, Mave? Nice.\nMAVEN: Yes.\nSENTIA: I’m glad you liked it. ’ll pass your comments on to the actors. A lot of people find the story of Vandekyrian’s betrayal the most powerful.\nGLINDA: Oh, no, that bit was rubbish. We liked the bit when Vandekyrian chased Omega down the corridor. That was very funny.\nSENTIA: I’m sorry?\nDALAND: (On mic. Out of breath) Sentia! Tarpov’s gone mad, he tried to attack me.\nSENTIA: (To herself) Oh, no. Not again. (To DALAND) Where is he?\nDALAND: How should I know? I’m concentrating on going where he isn’t...\nDALAND: SCENE 13: ACTORS’ GREEN ROOM.\nTARPOV: (Sobbing and raging) I know what you want to do, Omega. Oh, yes, I do. I know, and I know what to do. (Away from mic) 1 know how to stop you...\nTARPOV: You won’t stop me, Omega, I know how to stop you!!!\nTARPOV: SCENE 14: CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREEN ROOM.\nDALAND: I’m not sure I want to be here...\nSENTIA: He could have doubled back...\nDALAND: That’s why I don’t want to be here!\nDALAND: SCENE 15: HERITAGE CENTRE. ACTORS’ GREEN ROOM.\nSENTIA: Oh, my...\nDALAND: Tarpov!\nDOCTOR: (Off mic) When you two have finished staring, perhaps you can help me get this poor\nDOCTOR: fellow out of this machine...\nDOCTOR: They strain to take the weight of TARPOV.\nDOCTOR: Help me get him onto the bed. Try and support his back for me, that’s it.\nDALAND: Where’s his hand gone?\nSENTIA: Where do you think?\nDOCTOR: Now, I need those bed sheets over there...\nSENTIA: What, these?\nDOCTOR: Yes - no, no, no, don’t cover him! Tear one into strips! I’m going to have to fashion a\nDOCTOR: tourniquet. Don’t hover in front of the light, there’s a good chap...\nDALAND: Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: 22\nTARPOV: Had to... Had to...\nDOCTOR: (As he bandages TARPOV’s arm) Don’t get yourself excited, there’s a good chap. You’ve had a nasty shock to the system. (To SENTIA) This should staunch most of the bleeding. It’s lucky these\nDOCTOR: machines generate a lot of heat. It’s already cauterised most of the wound.\nSENTIA: They’re very efficient. Even the old ones.\nDOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately...\nTARPOV: Had to... Had to stop him.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you did. He’s raving.\nDALAND: He just attacked me, we were workshopping, and, well, the part just seemed to... to take him over. Started babbling all that stuff he came up with during the performance, then chased me out of the room.\nDALAND: DOCTOR And then he came back and did this? Extraordinary...\nSENTIA: Not really, Doctor. It happens every so often.\nDOCTOR: Does it?\nSENTIA: It’s this sector of space. There’s a high level of background psionic energy. It does things\nSENTIA: to people’s heads. Makes them susceptible to psychic impulses. As you can see, sometimes it sends them\nSENTIA: mad if they stay around too long.\nDALAND: Mind you, I’ve never seen one go violent before... They normally just dribble in the comer.\nDOCTOR: But surely you've got some kind of shielding to stop the effects?\nDALAND: They’ve been talking about that - it’s a bit pricey. Can’t afford to put the tickets up, these\nDALAND: old dears don’t have a lot of money to spare after they’ve forked out for the tinned food for Tiddles. (Going off mic) You do the tour, you take the risk.\nDOCTOR: Do you mean to say that your company risks the madness and death of innocents for... for the sake of a cheap holiday?\nSENTIA: They’re just actors, you know...\nDALAND: (Off mic) I heard that.\nSENTIA: That’s why there’s just a skeleton crew, lessen the risk.\nTARPOV: He’s going to kill them... Kill them all... Had to stop him.\nDOCTOR: Sh-sh-sh. It’s all right, ahm...\nDALAND: (Off mic)... he’s called Tarpov.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Tarpov, you’ve defeated him, he’s gone.\nTARPOV: No...\nDOCTOR: (Gently) He’s gone, yes, he’s gone. (Jo SENTIA, hushed) Why can’t robots do the reconstructions? After all, it’s hardly high art.\nDALAND: Hey, I heard that too. I won three awards you know.\nDOCTOR: Shhh!\nDALAND: (Quiet, coming back on mic) It’s all down to Intergalactic Equity, Doctor... They’re very\nDALAND: powerful, and they don’t like all the acting jobs going to automatons. I’m not having a robot doing pay\nDALAND: job. I don’t think a glorified kitchen appliance is capable of doing what I do.\nSENTIA: Oh, I dunno, a fridge might. You can get a lot of ham in a fridge...\nDOCTOR: Now, I seem to recall there’s a medical robot somewhere...\nSENTIA: You're right, on the shuttle. I'll just go and get it.\nDOCTOR: Well there you are, Daland, it’s not Just actors who get replaced by machines. Doctors can too...\nERTIKUS: Ah, there you are, Doctor, you didn’t actually get that book signed did you - oh, dear,\nERTIKUS: 23\nERTIKUS: what’s happened? Did you cut yourself? Your lovely jacket’s covered with blood.\nDALAND: There’s been an accident, sir.\nERTIKUS: Accident?\nDOCTOR: Not me. Him, I’m afraid.\nERTIKUS: Oh, my goodness!\nDALAND: He’s had a breakdown and hurt himself. That’s all.\nDOCTOR: (Under breath) Is it all... I just wonder who else was here when it happened.\nDALAND: Sorry? Surely you’re not suggesting someone did this to him?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. No. He did this to himself, no question about it. Whether he was in full control of his senses at the time... No, I just wondered why the other person who was here did what they did...\nERTIKUS: I don’t know what youre getting at.\nDOCTOR: Look at the controls of the waste disposal, they’re set well away from the machine on the\nDOCTOR: other side of the room. DALAND Of course, safety precaution. You wouldn’t want someone accidentally putting their...\nDOCTOR: um... yeah...\nDOCTOR: Quite. When I found him, he was physically attached to the machine, and it was off. He couldn’t reach the controls, so who turned off the waste disposal?\nERTIKUS: Failsafe cut-out?\nDOCTOR: No... (FX: Clang as DOCTOR smacks waste disposal) No cut-out switch, that’s why they’re obsolete. These old things were built of sturdy stuff. So, why save a man’s life, but do nothing to help him?\nTARPOV: Got to stop him... He will destroy... Omega will destroy... Destroy, he will destroy... Scintillans... Must stop\nERTIKUS: Scintillans...? What’s he going on about? Scintillans?\nDOCTOR: Where is that medical robot? Come on, Ertikus, let’s go and find it, hmm? Stay here, Daland.\nDALAND: You must be joking!\nDOCTOR: It’s all right. Just keep a close eye on him for safety.\nDALAND: Whose? His or mine?\nDOCTOR: You'll be all right. You’ve got that iron bar. Don’t you worry, at least you've got something\nDOCTOR: up your sleeve...\nDALAND: (Calling) That’s not funny. (To himself) 1 don’t think that’s funny. (Beat)I need a drink.\nDALAND: SCENE 16: OUTSIDE GREEN ROOM.\nERTIKUS: I wonder what made the poor chap do that?\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, Brtikus, you’re an historian! Page 374 of your book. Footnote: reference the ancient and venerable saga of Gallifrey. ‘And Vandekyrian was so mortified at what he had done, that he took his hand, which he raised against Omega, and struck it off, and cast it into the void...’ Tarpov is\nDOCTOR: acting out a twisted version of the legend like it’s real to him.\nERTIKUS: This is very alarming...\nDOCTOR: I agree.\nERTIKUS: I have that passage on page 212. You’re quoting my own rival’s hook at me. You’ve read\nERTIKUS: Shezion’s first, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR: Sorry.\nERTIKUS: Anyway, I know all that. But what are ‘Scintillans’, Doctor? They don’t feature in\nERTIKUS: 24\nERTIKUS: Gallifreyan folklore as far as I know...\nDOCTOR: Well, there you have me. I don’t believe I’ve come across them either -\nERTIKUS: Ill tell you what. I’ve got some equipment in the shuttle’s cargo hold. It contains an impressive library of books on Time Lord history - some of them even written by that old fool Shezion. ’ll go and look up ‘Scintillans’ if you like.\nDOCTOR: Good man! And I'll go and look for Sentia and that robot doctor.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 17: TOUR SHUTTLE.\nSENTIA: I can’t do that to the Doctor! It’s too dangerous. What if I kill him by accident?\nDOCTOR: Who are you talking to? (NB cues such as this one are ‘on mic’ intentionally. He is not arriving in the room, he is already there)\nSENTIA: Doctor! You startled me.\nDOCTOR: Did you say something about killing someone by accident?\nSENTIA: Er, yes! Tarpov. I was just talking to myself about the medibot. It’s more used to dealing with heart failure than injuries. I hope it doesn’t kill him by accident.\nDOCTOR: I see. Well, I think I’d better look in on him, and see how it’s doing. First things first, though. I think I’d better introduce myself. I’m called the Doctor.\nSENTIA: (.Surprised) 1 know that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Which is odd that you do, because I’m not on your manifest, and you’ve been calling me\nDOCTOR: Doctor ever since you met me. How do you know who I am?\nSENTIA: Stay where you are. I don’t want to hurt you. But you have to see Omega.\nDOCTOR: Ah.

And I hear parts of the Peak District are extremely\nDOCTOR: nice.\nOMEGA: (Echoey. Ominous) Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: Definitely not Blackpool, though. Too brash for my liking.\nOMEGA: (Echoey. Enraged) Cease this endless prattling!\nDOCTOR: Oh, must I? But I do it so well. My ability with endless prattle is legendary. Many people\nDOCTOR: have commented on my prattling. I’ve won awards for prattling. I don’t like to go to the award ceremonies,\nDOCTOR: though - they’re very boring. You should hear the length of the acceptance speeches. They do tend to go\nDOCTOR: 26\nDOCTOR: on a bit, but then again, they are such good prattlers you see-\nOMEGA: (Echoey. Over storm) You try my patience!\nDOCTOR: (Shouting. Over storm. Even angrier than OMEGA) Oh, do I? Oh, do I really? Well, let me tell you this, if you've quite finished with your histrionics, Omega...\nDOCTOR: (Murderous whisper) Thank you so much... I will try your patience all I like, Omega, because if you want my help, then you’d better try to control that temper of yours!\nDOCTOR: There is a tense silence.\nOMEGA: (Laughs. He relaxes, the echoey voice is gone) My apologies. I am not used to ‘asking’ for anything.\nDOCTOR: Accepted. Now what do you want, and it’d better be important. I’m not used to helping out megalomaniacs, you know.\nOMEGA: No longer. After our last encounter I was left a formless spirit in the ether. I was\nOMEGA: cleansed. Reborn.\nDOCTOR: I see... And where does your trigger-happy stewardess friend come into all this?\nOMEGA: Oh, Sentia... Sentia has been my rock. Her telepathic abilities shone out to me like a beacon. My consciousness reached out to hers, and she gave me focus, both literally in the form of a psionic carrier, and figuratively, in giving me the resolve to bring about my life’s fulfilment.\nDOCTOR: ‘Gave me focus?’ ‘Resolve to bring about my life’s fulfilment?’ So you’ve gone from being a power-crazed tyrant to talking like an American. I’m not sure which is better.\nOMEGA: I am now as my brother Time Lords knew me before, Doctor. No monster, no tyrant, just the first and greatest scientist of our people.\nOMEGA: DOCTOR And the most modest, obviously. So what does this new, improved Omega want?\nOMEGA: (Wistful) I want to go... home, Doctor...\nOMEGA: SCENE 20: HERITAGE CENTRE. EMBARKATION AREA.\nEX: Embarkation chimes. Muttering crowd of old biddies.\nSENTIA: Hello, visitors. I’m very sorry to interrupt your enjoyment of the Omega Heritage Centre. It has come to our attention that you, ladies and gentlemen, are our ten thousandth tour party! In honour of this occasion, if you could make your way to the Prydonian’s Pantry, our waitrobots have been\nSENTIA: programmed to give you all free cream teas!\nSENTIA: Just through that door, there... There’s three flavours of jam...\nDALAND: (On mic, out of breath) Sentia! Sentia!\nSENTIA: What is it now, Daland?\nDALAND: Something terrible’s happened. Something else terrible... I was only gone for a minute, I swear... Just to get a drink from hospitality.\nSENTIA: And?\nDALAND: You'd better come and have a look.\nDALAND: SCENE 21: ACTORS’ GREEN ROOM.\nDALAND: There. It was like this when I got back. No Tarpov, no Doctor, the medibot blasted into\nDALAND: 27\nDALAND: tiny bits...\nSENTIA: What could have happened?\nDALAND: It’s obvious, isn’t it? Tarpov’s gone berserk, hasn’t he? He’s destroyed the robot, he’s probably killed the Doctor and stuffed him in a drawer somewhere. Look at the way all the bits of that\nDALAND: robot are spread along the corridor. Someone got dragged out of here... Well, no one’s dragging me out of\nDALAND: anywhere.\nSENTIA: You're being paranoid...\nDALAND: No, dear, paranoid’s when they’re not out to get you. Tarpov thinks ’m Omega, and he’s\nDALAND: going to come after me! I’ve always had this strange premonition that I would end my life by dying...\nSENTIA: Daland! Listen. You play the part of the greatest time engineer who ever lived, a man who killed suns and put his head into the mouth of a black hole, and you’re going to run away? Do you think\nSENTIA: Omega would act like this?\nDALAND: You’ve been here too long, Sentia, you’re starting to sound like one of the interactive exhibits.\nSENTIA: So, you’re going to do what? Take the shuttle and run like a coward?\nDALAND: No, I’m going to take the shuttle and heroically fetch help like a hero. Why do you think I\nDALAND: got three awards for Hearts in Orbit? Because, as an actor, I have the ability to draw on untapped resources. And coming back here with security is just a more literal version of exactly the same thing. It’s\nDALAND: not just Omega who can he a hero, you know. You're going to realise just what kind of person I really am.\nSENTIA: I know what kind of person you really are.\nDALAND: Oh, yes? And what’s that?\nDALAND: Oww, my arm! (Drowsy) What did you... What was you... what was... that on... my arm...? SENTIA To answer both your questions, Daland... Just a harmless little prick...\nDALAND: SCENE 22: THE SAILING SHIP IN THE DOCTOR’S DREAM. Atmos: ocean swelling, creaking of timbers.\nDOCTOR: You want to go home? To Gallifrey?\nOMEGA: No, not to Gallifrey.\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand...\nOMEGA: There is nothing for me there. I want to go back to my universe.\nDOCTOR: But didn’t you move heaven and earth, literally, to get here, into this one? And now you\nDOCTOR: want to leave? Was it something we said?\nOMEGA: It is true, I am here. That is all. Just ‘here’. Impotent. Powerless. A shadow of what I was. I have found this reality to be a cold unwelcoming place. I know now where I belong.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re not seeing it at its best...\nOMEGA: Doctor, I can feel my world calling to me... Can you imagine what it’s like for me, someone who ruled his own infinite kingdom, to know of a realm where godhood can literally be achieved, and yet no matter how hard I stretch, it’s just out of reach? To brush it with my fingers. To know that it lies out there, it is too much to bear. Will you help me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know how I can. I hope you’re not asking for a lift.\nDOCTOR: Negotiating my way into a world of anti-matter isn’t like popping down the road to buy a newspaper. I only tend to travel to other universes by accident... Come to think of it, I only tend to travel anywhere by accident. Even if I wanted to help, I don’t see how I can.\nOMEGA: You will, Doctor... you will. (Echoey) You will.\nOMEGA: 28\nOMEGA: SCENE 23: TOUR SHUTTLE. CARGO HOLD.\nOMEGA: Atmos: echoey.\nDOCTOR: (Groaning as he wakes up)\nSENTIA: Are you all right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think so... Where am I?\nDOCTOR: SENTIA In the tour shuttle’s cargo hold. You talked to Omega, Doctor? You saw him?\nDOCTOR: We had a lovely little chat. Asked me to break every rule of physics in the library, but apart from that it was most convivial.\nSENTIA: Will you help him, Doctor? You owe it to him to try.\nDOCTOR: I don’t owe Omega anything... (Pause) Anyway as I said to him, I don’t see how I can help...\nERTIKUS: (On mic) Doctor! You down here, too? Come to take a peek?\nDOCTOR: Peek’ at what, Professor?\nERTIKUS: You've not see? Oh, Doctor, just you take a look out of that window...\nDOCTOR: If you insist... (Off mic) Interesting. Now, I know it sounds like I’m making this a habit, but I’m sure that’s...\nERTIKUS: (Awed) Omega’s ship, the Eurydice herself.\nDOCTOR: It’s not another cleverly camouflaged museum, is it?\nSENTIA: No, not this time...\nDOCTOR: Amazing... (Hushed) So that’s what he meant... Do you realise how dangerous it could be?\nDOCTOR: Taking that ship through the event horizon could turn both universes inside out...\nSENTIA: (Hushed) Please, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (Pauses, then calls) Professor! I presume you’re on your way to look at the Eurydice.\nERTIKUS: (Off mic) Tl say! I didn’t come on this tour for the scones In the Prydonian Pantry, you know. Nice though they are...\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I wondered if... I’m afraid I’m at a bit of an inconvenience, Professor, my transport is temporarily unavailable, and I wonder if I could prevail on you for a lift.\nERTIKUS: (Inside) Can’t resist it, eh? You’re curious, I can tell. Bums like a lighted candle in the dark. Well, no-can-do, I’m afraid. Going to use my advanced equipment over there. Very secret.\nDOCTOR: Oh, surely, Ertikus, you haven’t got anything I haven’t seen many times before. This old wooden cabinet? It’s just a TARDIS, after ah.\nERTIKUS: TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Well, you are a Time Lord, aren’t you?\nERTIKUS: Oh. Is it that obvious?\nDOCTOR: It burns like a lighted candle in the dark, Professor.\nERTIKUS: What gave it away?\nERTIKUS: DOCTOR The fact you’re even contemplating going over there. The only craft that could navigate\nERTIKUS: across that sector of dimensional instability unaided is a TARDIS, and the only type of being that could\nERTIKUS: survive in the dimensional instability unaided...\nERTIKUS: ...is a Time Lord. Obvious, really. DOCTOR And it takes one to know one, too.\nERTIKUS: So... you’re a Time Lord, too... Doctor...? You’re the Doctor! No! With emphasis on the\nERTIKUS: 29\nERTIKUS: definite article?\nDOCTOR: Well, as definite as I can ever be...\nERTIKUS: My dear chap! I’m so sorry, I didn’t make the connection... The heroic ex-president of Gallifrey who vanquished the terrible Omega! I expect you can tell me a thing or two about him, eh, Doctor? Oh, can I interview you about your part in the destruction of the Omega myth?\nDOCTOR: My what?\nERTIKUS: My dear chap, Omega was perceived as a whiter-than- white hero until you came along! It wasn’t until you tussled with him, we started to look more critically at the legend and reassess his lofty\nERTIKUS: status in Time Lord folklore!\nDOCTOR: (Disappointed) Oh, was it?\nERTIKUS: That1l show Shezion! Dematerialisation in five minutes?\nSENTIA: (Whispered) Thank you, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Well, perhaps I do owe Omega something after all. While I’m there, will you keep an eye\nDOCTOR: on things here?\nDOCTOR: SENTIA Of course I will, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 24: INT. ERTIKUS’S TARDIS.\nERTIKUS: Right then, if we set that there and arrange that there, then... (FX: TARDIS door opens) Ah, hello Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Professor.\nERTIKUS: Now then, I’ve researched your battles with Omega in great detail. In fact, just a short\nERTIKUS: time ago I went to twentieth-century earth to have a look of the scene of your last tussle, the one when he used your bio-data to bond physically with you and create a matter imprint-\nDOCTOR: (Cutting across) I suppose this is dangerously close to real history for you, Professor.\nERTIKUS: Ah, when one gets to one’s last incarnation, the prospect of finally discovering history, rather than analysing, theorising and reinterpreting does hold some excitement. Do you know the Time Lord President Mundat the Third?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I know ofhim, a somewhat colourful historical figure, as I remember...\nERTIKUS: Don’t I know it. I’ve done no less than three documentaries on him. In the first one, he was a vicious tyrant, victim of a botched regeneration that made him bitter and twisted, and the murderer of the Arcalian consorts. Couple of years later, I have to do another series, because now everyone thinks he’s a noble warrior who worked his way up from the Chancellery guard, and protected the Arcalian consorts, and they were actually killed by his Castellan. Now, there’s talk of him being a nasty piece of work after all, and so yours truly has to go back out with the old vidibot and make another one...\nDOCTOR: I see, and what with Gallifreyan history being off limits to time travel, you'll never find out for certain.\nERTIKUS: But I will, Doctor. Where Omega is concerned Ill know, and know for certain.\nERTIKUS: SCENE 25: TOUR SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nDALAND: (Calling drowsily) Sentia... Sentia...\nSENTIA: What?\nDALAND: (Sounding drunk) Where... where am I?\nDALAND: 30\nSENTIA: (Off mic) In the cockpit of the shuttle. We have things to do.\nDALAND: What exactly? Hey... you did... did something to me...\nSENTIA: I needed to... to shut you up.\nDALAND: Why?\nSENTIA: Later, Daland, later. (Quiet) I’m sorry...\nSENTIA: SCENE 26: OMEGA’S SHIP, THE EURYDICE. CONTROL ROOM. Atmos: echoey. FX: Materialisation of ERTIKUS’s TARDIS. TARDIS door opens, there are two sets of footsteps. A floating robot glides with them.\nERTIKUS: This is incredible. We’re actually on the Eurydice. The Ship of Omega himself. The vessel that pushed the Time Lord race out of mere civilization and into godhood. Are you getting this, vidibot?\nVIDIBOT: Yes, Professor.\nERTIKUS: You know, Doctor, this is why I became an historian. Omega was my hero when I was at the Academy...\nDOCTOR: Yes, he was mine, too.\nERTIKUS: Then you'll appreciate all of this, too. I dreamed that one day I’d find out everything there was to know about him.\nDOCTOR: Did you really? I always thought it would spoil things, knowing all there was to know about him. I think it’s best to have some element of mystery about the character.\nERTIKUS: Oh, no, I couldn’t disagree more. Nothing annoyed me more when fans of Omega concocted these convoluted theories to explain away discrepancies in the legends. Like the betrayal by Rassilon for example. No one’s ever proved it was the case. I calculated the likeliest time zone when the Eurydice was to enter this universe, and now it’s mine to explore. I want to know exactly what happened on this ship to cause it to fall into the black hole, and if I have to crawl through every inch of it... You'll have to excuse me, Doctor. History beckons. Real history. Running, vidibot...? (Eamest and somewhat facile for the camera) It was here, in this very place, that the greatest engineer of them all laid the foundations of Time Lord society. (Away from the mic, into bowels of ship) Strange to think, that an age of enlightenment was brought about by the cruel and callous figure who was notorious...\nDOCTOR: (Waits until he is gone) So, here I am. Hello? (Declaiming) Is there anybody there? No. Not, a creature was stirring, not arat, a bat, or a cat, a gnu or a kangaroo, not a moose on the loose...\nEX: Shimmery sound as OMEGA manifests himself:\nDOCTOR: .. Just a mole, who lived in a hole. I spy with my little eye, something beginning with ‘Omega’. Let me guess. More psionic energy, am I right?\nOMEGA: Well done, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Enough to make a proper manifestation - as long as you stay in this sector of space, of course.\nOMEGA: Ironic, is it not. To give myself existence, I must return to the very place where I was\nOMEGA: betrayed and destroyed. (Beat) There is another here... He is babbling into a machine, speaking half-truths\nOMEGA: and nonsense.\nDOCTOR: He works in television. I’m told they do that.\nOMEGA: He is an old fool.\nDOCTOR: No, he’s just an old man with a dream. He’s looking for the real Omega. I think he’d be\nDOCTOR: quite annoyed to find out he’s right under his nose.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 27: ANOTHER PART OF THE SHIP.\nDOCTOR: oul\nERTIKUS: (On mic) The word Time Lord’ is a term worn lightly by any Gallifreyan with a capsule, but only he and a few others like him, can truly deserve to be called literally ‘Lords’ of ‘Time’... Cease recording, vidibot.\nERTIKUS: Vidibot... Am I seeing things?\nVIDIBOT: Yes, sir.\nERTIKUS: I meant, am I seeing that thing there. (Sighs) Never mind. That shimmering thing on the wall. Record it.\nVIDIBOT: Yes, sir.\nERTIKUS: I wonder what it is?\nERTIKUS: SCENE 28: THE EURYDICE. CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: (Coming in as a door opens then closes) Right, this is the Eurydice's bridge, so if we’re going to send you on your merry way, we’re going to need these engines... Let’s have a look... Ignition, fusion reactors, here we are... Just press this button...\nDOCTOR: ... and answer came there none. It should have worked.\nDOCTOR: As it was trapped in a state of flux, there should be very little corrosion in the circuits. Let’s have a look...\nEX: Rummages in box. Noise of flashy sonic-screwdriver-type tool. Minor explosion.\nDOCTOR: (Coughing) Ow, well look on the bright side. At least we’ve found some power. Why did I stick my face in a piece of antiquated machinery like that?\nOMEGA: I wonder... Could instability be the reason?\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, the fact ’m not completely stable could well be the reason I stick my face into\nDOCTOR: antiquated machinery...\nOMEGA: No, Doctor, I mean, could the dimensional instability in this part of space have a dampening effect on the engines?\nDOCTOR: It’s possible. What do you suggest?\nOMEGA: We could connect the dimensional stabiliser of the Professor’s TARDIS to its own force- field, boost it, and create what you might call a ‘still point’ to the hurricane...\nDOCTOR: That’s incredibly clever. That’s exactly what I’d do...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 29: TOUR SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nDALAND: (Less groggy) If you wanted to tie me up, Sentia, my dear, you only had to ask. (Dity chuckle)\nSENTIA: Very soon, Daland, you'll understand what’s going on. And your part in it.\nDALAND: Sorry, I don’t get you...\nSENTIA: He’s done it. He’s done it! We’re on our way.\nDALAND: What?\nSENTIA: Look. Out there. What d’you see?\nDALAND: I see a ship. A very big ship.\nDALAND: 32\nSBNTIA: Not any ship. Omega’s ship. Not a story, not a re-enactment, not make-believe. It’s real. And Omega is there on it, not an actor, not you in a silly costume. The real, genuine Omega. Isn’t it fantastic to see something real for a change? Daland?\nDALAND: I’ve always rather liked you, Sentia. Thought we could go places together. But right now, drugged and tied to a chair, ’m beginning to wonder if your mind hasn’t gone the same way as poor\nDALAND: young Tarpov’s!\nDALAND: SCENE 30: OMEGA’S SHIP. CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Now let’s see if putting the stabilisers on has encouraged the engines to go for a spin.\nDOCTOR: Still nothing. Hmm. I wonder...\nDOCTOR: Ah! This is why. Should have thought of it before. It’s a traditional cipher-indent\nDOCTOR: mechanism. The ignition sequence is on a random multi-phase pattern, and relies on some sort of symbiotic imprint, presumably the crew’s. Am I correct?\nOMEGA: I stand in awe of your deductive capabilities...\nDOCTOR: Oh, you're just sulking because your dimensional stabiliser theory was proved wrong. Unfortunately the crew are somewhat indisposed, aren’t they? Ill have to bypass that and rig up a switch to set them off mechanically. Shouldn’t be a problem...\nOMEGA: Doctor... Tell me... How am I seen?\nDOCTOR: Sonic wrench. Where’s the sonic wrench? How are you seen? Well you’re all sort of\nDOCTOR: sparkly and shimmery, like a Christmas tree. Don’t worry. It looks very nice.\nOMEGA: What I meant was, Doctor, how am I seen on Gallifrey? What stories do they tell of me now?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know... Hero of time, founding father of the most enduring civilisation in the\nDOCTOR: universe. The usual.\nOMEGA: You're very kind, but I suspect the truth is somewhat different.\nDOCTOR: (Not really listening) Well, what is truth, anyway...\nOMEGA: Truth is important, Doctor. A story is nothing without truth. The truth is nothing without\nOMEGA: its own story.\nDOCTOR: Really. Where is that wrench?\nOMEGA: There was a statue made of me that they erected in the Great Hall of the Academy. As I watched it being fashioned I thought, As I long as that statue stands, so will my legacy.’ But I realised it would I crumble and erode, even on a planet that hides itself like a hermit from I the passage of time. Then I thought: if I could shape the universe like that 5 mason shaped his ebonite, then my name and my story would live jfuntouched untl the end of eternity...\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s very poetic, but most people who think they can shape the universe tend to chip off an important bit they didn’t mean to - did I ever tell you about the time I met Praxitelles? There\nDOCTOR: he was, carving his Venus, chatting away nineteen to the dozen. I told him to concentrate, but did he\nDOCTOR: listen?\nOMEGA: Is my statue still in its place?\nDOCTOR: Ah, no - you see there was an invasion, lot of guns and shouting, and unfortunately it\nDOCTOR: got damaged. I think they were repairing it, I did see it in a workshop somewhere...\nDOCTOR: 33\nOMEGA: You see... I should imagine it is forgotten... placed in a dark place and forgotten about... dusty and dilapidated...\nDOCTOR: Now, there you go again with your self-pity. ‘Why do all the nice Time Lords hate me?’ Why do you think I’m helping you? It’s not often you get to work with one of your heroes.\nOMEGA: Why, thank you, Doctor. This is... unexpected.\nDOCTOR: Is it? Is it really? Can the great Omega have such a poor idea of how he is perceived by\nDOCTOR: his own people? You were idolised by every Gallifreyan I knew. You were an inspiration, I tried to live my life by the values you set down, it’s no coincidence that we’re actually very alike, you and me.\nDOCTOR: Where did I put the zeus plugs?\nOMEGA: We are alike, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely... apart from the ‘wanting to destroy the Time Lords in a hideous act of\nDOCTOR: revenge’ stuff - though I’ve had a few days like that myself. Your speeches about using the Time Lord technology to change the universe for the good, made at a time of such barbarity, it must have taken courage. It gave me the courage to question a few things myself. (FX: Rattle in box) Zeus plugs... There they are! We both rebelled against the orthodoxy of the society we lived in; you in the name of science, and me in the name of sticking my nose in things that don’t necessarily concern me... And as a price for\nDOCTOR: that we both of course - um.\nOMEGA: (Rising anger) The price we both paid for our ambitions was exile? Is that what you were going to say, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Wishing he hadn't started this) Yes, yes, I was.\nOMEGA: I languished in the heart of a black hole for millennia. What did you have to endure?\nDOCTOR: Um... the Brigadier mostly.\nOMEGA: But the Time Lords didn’t forget you, Doctor. Oh, no, your freedom was restored to you. Your reward for defeating Omega, the monster from another universe.\nDOCTOR: You're not seen as a monster. You’re revered-\nOMEGA: Was revered, Doctor. I was in the Matrix, remember, I know that I am feared and pitied. I\nOMEGA: am just another creature to scare children. ‘You’d better do your cosmic science homework, young Veldin, or while you’re sleeping, Omega will creep out of his black hole and turn you to anti-matter.’\nDOCTOR: Omega, they’re just stories. Stories don’t matter-\nOMEGA: (Sudden burst of anger) Yes they do, Doctor! I am hanging onto existence by my fingernails! I am\nOMEGA: barely able to be seen! How others perceive me is all I have!\nOMEGA: SCENE 31: ANOTHER PART OF OMEGA’S SHIP.\nERTIKUS: There’s definitely something in there...\nVIDIBOT: Yes, sir.\nERTIKUS: Some kind of creature. No, there’s more than one - dozens of them! Ye Gods - did you see that?\nVIDIBOT: Sir?\nERTIKUS: One of them looked at me, there’s nothing there. I could see right through its eyes... I\nERTIKUS: could see the bulkhead behind it. I wonder what they are...?\nSCINTILLANS: (Soft, musical) S-scintillans...\nERTIKUS: Scintillans? Who are you? What are you? What have you got to do with Omega?\nSCINTILLANS: Omega...\nSCINTILLANS: 34\nERTIKUS: That’s right. Omega. What are you to Omega?\nSCINTILLANS: Omega... Oooommmeeegggaaa... Deeeaaattthhh... .\nSCINTILLANS: SCENE 32: EURYDICE. CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Whoops!\nOMEGA: Doctor, are you sure you know exactly what you’re doing?\nDOCTOR: I sincerely hope not. Not exactly, anyway. Ah. Look what I’ve found!\nOMEGA: Oh, yes. Wires. You had wires before.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but those wires were yellow. These are green!\nOMEGA: (Chuckles) Doctor! You are incorrigible! Just like Peylix!\nDOCTOR: Peylix?\nOMEGA: Yes, just someone I was... close to. Before your time. Before everybody’s time.\nDOCTOR: Not Peylix the Annoyingly Curious?\nOMEGA: Do you know a Peylix?\nDOCTOR: I know of a Peylix. He was a figure from an old Gallifreyan fable. The Time Lord who wanted to know everything about everything.\nOMEGA: How does the story go?\nDOCTOR: Well, there was this theory, in the Old Times, that the universe needed to believe in\nDOCTOR: magic, that if anyone actually understood how all the science worked, if everything got demystified, then all this fantastical technology would all pack up and stop working altogether. Then one day there was a lowly time plumber called Peylix who resolved to do just that, and to know everything about everything. Luckily for Peylix, his job was to get rid of all the quantum packets of time left over after the temporal experiments that clogged the vortex tubes. So, at the end of each day, he left work with some spare time under his robes, and used that spare time to study. So, he studied and he studied and he studied, and then he studied a bit more until finally he understood all there was to know. And then guess what...\nOMEGA: Everything stopped working?\nDOCTOR: Everything stopped working. The TARDISes, the food dispensers, even the cat-flaps. So the Time Lords brought Peylix before them and told him to leave, not just Gallifrey but the entire\nDOCTOR: universe. So he did, everything started working once more, and Peylix was never seen again.\nOMEGA: Interesting... Shall I tell you my story about Peylix, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Please do.\nOMEGA: Once upon a time there was a lowly time plumber called Peylix, who worked alongside the\nOMEGA: Great Omega. You may have heard of the Great Omega.\nDOCTOR: Slightly... 1 was never up on the more obscure figures in Time Lord history.\nOMEGA: He wanted to know everything about everything, too. Omega didn’t know how curious he was, and just how much he wanted to know everything, but Omega did find out eventually... when the Chancellery Guard came for Peylix in their laboratory, during a time experiment, and he was placed in a\nOMEGA: dispersal chamber. And guess what, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Peylix was never seen again?\nOMEGA: Peylix was never seen again.\nDOCTOR: (Pause) Perhaps Sentia’s company is right. Perhaps the stories of the past are more fun\nDOCTOR: than the actual history itself... That’s a very sad and tragic story.\nOMEGA: Yes, it is, isn’t it? Very sad and tragic. If it were true.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: 35\nOMEGA: I made it up.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nOMEGA: Does it matter? He could have been a spy who fed secrets to our enemies and was dispersed, or a tyrant who threatened Gallifrey and was vaporized. He could have been a hero who died\nOMEGA: fighting vampires. Why should a story matter if it is not true?\nDOCTOR: I see your point.\nOMEGA: For Peylix and I, the stories of our deeds are all we have left.\nDOCTOR: So what really happened to him? You can tell me, Omega.\nOMEGA: (Laughs) Peylix the Annoyingly Curious is in good company! (Darker) He died, Doctor. He\nOMEGA: was killed by a man called Luvis, and I stood there, and watched, and did nothing. And from that point on I decided to interfere, and make some sort of difference to the universe, and not to stand by and watch\nOMEGA: again.\nOMEGA: SCENE 33: ANOTHER PART OF THE EURYDICE.\nERTIKUS: Tell me! What’s your connection to Omega? What did he do to you? Did he kill you all? Answer me!\nERTIKUS: It’s gone quiet... Wonder why?\nVIDIBOT: I cannot say, Professor. I do not have analytical facilities. However, in my capacity as rostrum vidibot on numerous wildlife documentaries, I have gathered that certain creatures do go silent before they attack.\nERTIKUS: (Starts scoffing, then realisation dawns) Well, really... I'm so glad you told me... that’s nice to... know...\nSCINTILLANS: Oooommmeeegggaaaa!\nSCINTILLANS: SCENE 34: OMEGA’S SHIP. CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Right, here we go... I’ve bypassed the symbiotic link by using good old-fashioned\nDOCTOR: electronic impulses. Let’s see if it works.\nOMEGA: Listen to that, Doctor... What an exquisite sound... I haven’t heard that music for centuries...\nDOCTOR: Yes, well... Best to have it diminuendo for now, don’t want us moving to a new universe\nDOCTOR: before we’re ready.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s about it... There’s no fee, not even a call-out charge. You see this?\nDOCTOR: It’s a remote activator. This switch sets the engines going, this light flashes if anyone attempts to take the engines offline, and this hinge opens the access panel. Quite a neat little chap. I point the ship towards the dimensional rift, and then activate the engines from the safety of Ertikus’s TARDIS, and you can journey on your merry way.\nOMEGA: Don’t lose it, Doctor, you hold the future of Omega in your hand.\nDOCTOR: Well, in my pocket now actually. Don’t worry - I’ve never lost anything from them yet.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately... Sometimes I wonder if I could probably do with losing the odd item.\nDOCTOR: 36\nDOCTOR: I mean, do I really need a bag of caramelised humbugs, a rubber snake, several bits of string cut to one-inch lengths? Oh... and what seem to be several pieces of twisted and blackened metal. I wonder how they got there? Oh well, better not wonder too much about them - don’t want to end up like\nDOCTOR: Peylix, eh, Omega? (Pause) Omega?\nERTIKUS: (To mic) Doctor! Doctor! (Out of breath) Doctor, you will not believe what I’ve witnessed... There’s something alive here with us!\nDOCTOR: What...?\nERTIKUS: Creatures... Flying transparent wraiths... They attacked us, like screaming banshees...\nERTIKUS: Chased us down miles of corridors, didn’t they, vidibot?\nVIDIBOT: Yes, sir.\nERTIKUS: It was absolutely marvellous...\nDOCTOR: Really?\nERTIKUS: Oh, yes! They called themselves Scintillans, Doctor! Scintillans! It clinches it! Tarpov must\nERTIKUS: have discovered something. They must have something to do with Omega - he must have done something terrible to them... (Off mic) ’'m going to check my TARDIS’s database, see what is has to say about ‘Scintillans’.\nOMEGA: (Urgent, hissing) You must stop that old fool, Doctor. Stop him! He is an incompetent meddler. He will ruin everything!\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’re back. Getting a bit close to the truth, is he? The truth about these ‘Scintillans’, whatever they are...\nOMEGA: There is... nothing for him to discover...\nDOCTOR: I hope so, for your sake. He’s very persistent. Let’s hope he doesn’t start questioning the\nDOCTOR: same things as I am. Such as all that rubbish you spouted earlier, about increased psionic energy enabling you to manifest yourself. Where’s the focus for your mind to manifest? Sentia? I find it extremely doubtful that her mind would be powerful enough to act as a focus, and give you licence to flit around\nDOCTOR: this ship like Marley’s ghost.\nOMEGA: Nevertheless, I am here.\nDOCTOR: I know, and that’s what puzzles me.\nERTIKUS: (Off mic) Doctor, is there someone out there with you?\nDOCTOR: Just talking to myself, Professor. First sign of madness, I know...\nERTIKUS: (Off) Doctor, I can’t help but notice, but my dimensional stabiliser seems to be hooked up to the forcefield.\nDOCTOR: Oh, just trying out a little experiment...\nERTIKUS: (Off) Oh, fine. Pll just disconnect it, shall IP\nDOCTOR: By all means...\nOMEGA: (Hissing) No, Doctor! He must not disconnect the circuit!\nDOCTOR: (Calling) Hang on a minute, Professor - could you leave it as it is for a tad longer? Got a few\nDOCTOR: more tests to do.\nERTIKUS: (Off) Righto, I'll just be off again. They’re out there somewhere, and they know the truth. Wish me luck!\nDOCTOR: Now, why do you want to keep that circuit connected? (FX: Clang) A ship’s just docked. But it can’t!\nOMEGA: Oh, but it can, Doctor.\nOMEGA: 37\nSENTIA: Tour shuttle to Eurydice. Come in, please...\nDOCTOR: (Realising) Of course it can. Thanks to Ertikus’s dimensional stabiliser.\nSENTIA: Tour shuttle to Eurydice. Omega! Omega! Are you there?\nOMEGA: I am here, Sentia.\nSENTIA: It’s you! Thank heavens. Is... the Doctor... there with you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m here.\nSENTIA: Oh. I’d hoped he’d gone.\nDOCTOR: Charming. Is that all the thanks I get?\nSENTIA: Daland is here with me... Can you open the airlock?\nOMEGA: Doctor? Can you do it? I’m not good with buttons these days.\nDOCTOR: You tricked me.\nOMEGA: If I had asked you to make this ship inhabitable so she could join me here... Would you have helped me?\nDOCTOR: If you’d asked instead of commanded I might have considered it! What about the people in the Centre! Without the shuttle they’re trapped in a dangerous sector of space!\nSENTIA: Don’t worry, Doctor. They'll be safe. I guarantee it.\nSENTIA: DOCTOR And what about Daland? How does he figure in your plans?\nSENTIA: Daland? He doesn’t know it yet but he’s performing the service.\nDOCTOR: What service?\nDOCTOR: SENTIA The wedding service, Doctor... Omega and I are to be married.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 35: TOUR SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nDALAND: (Off mic) What did you just say?\nSENTIA: (Distracted, as she calibrates the console) We’re getting married, Daland. Omega and I are getting married. That’s what I said. (Pause) Can’t believe it. Daland is finally speechless. Is it because I’m marrying a ten- thousand-year-old spirit from another dimension? Or the fact I can be interested in someone other than the renowned\nSENTIA: soap star and his precious awards? Or is it just because you've never come across the concept of marriage before?\nTARPOV: It’s because I’ve hit him over the head with the handle of your gun.\nSENTIA: (Shocked) Tarpov... You’re-\nTARPOV: (Stall quite hysterical) Married, eh? To Omega? Eh? What happened to just cause or\nTARPOV: impediment? Speak now and forever hold your peace. That’s what they say, isn’t it? I’d better do it then, hadn’t I?\nTARPOV: SCENE 36: EURYDICE. CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: (Into Intercom) Hello, Sentia. I’ve opened the airlock. (To OMEGA) Well, I would never have guessed you had it in you, and at your time of life, too.\nDOCTOR: OMEGA A happy event. A sacred ceremony which echoes across almost every culture in the universe, whereby two individuals can become one, and this one also symbolises the union of my universe... and yours. Is that not a glorious concept, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I suppose... Just as long as I can sit on the bride’s side.\nDOCTOR: 38\nOMEGA: (Laughs) You are known for your compassion, Doctor. Can you not give an old Time Lord\nOMEGA: his last wish in this universe?\nTARPOV: Oh, no, Omega, we can’t. Because you're evil. Sentia just doesn’t know it yet, does she?\nDOCTOR: (Astonished) That’s Tarpov...!\nOMEGA: Vandekyrian, you cringing worm. Come out here and face me, insect!\nDOCTOR: Omega... Don’t get him excited...\nSENTIA: Doctor - he’s got my gun...\nTARPOV: You think you are the only one who can destroy lives, Omega? No, you’re not the only one.\nOMEGA: You dare try to defy me?\nTARPOV: ...1 can do it to you, just like you did it to them. Just you watch.\nDOCTOR: Tarpov!!!\nSENTIA: (Screams)\nSENTIA: END OF PART TWO.\nSENTIA: 39"

I couldn’t stop him now...\nSENTIA: If he gets to you, hel stop you. He'll destroy you. You’ve got to go, Tarp-Vandekyrian... Save yourself...\nTARPOV: Yes...\nSENTIA: I'll need the gun... won’t I? I mean, to defend myself from him...\nTARPOV: Yes, yes, of course... you have it... He’s coming... Omega’s coming and I can’t stop him... I\nTARPOV: can see him in my mind... I can hear his pain, his confusion, his rage beating against my head... Oh, he’s\nTARPOV: coming...\nSENTIA: Go!\nTARPOV: (Shrieking, as he moves away from mic) He’s coming...!\nSENTIA: Go!\nSENTIA: the scene. Door opens.\nOMEGA: (Fury) Where is he? Where is that suppurating maggot?\nSENTIA: He’s gone. Omega...\nOMEGA: What did Vandekyrian say to you! What did he say?\nSENTIA: Nothing! Nothing! He didn’t say anything!\nSENTIA: 40\nSENTIA: Pause.\nDOCTOR: How very touching. I always like to see young couples greet each other. It always gets me right here... and here.\nOMEGA: Doctor, be silent!!!\nDOCTOR: Well, if he won’t ask you, I will. Are you all right?\nSENTIA: I’m fine... Is... Daland, is he...?\nDOCTOR: (Off mic) Yes... He’s fine. Had a bit of a nasty knock but he1ll recover.\nSENTIA: Thank goodness...\nOMEGA: Spare no compassion for him, Sentia. He is a prancing fool, a painted marionette dancing\nOMEGA: and twitching in my name for the delight of the gawping masses.\nDOCTOR: First rule of being a superstar, Omega, don’t dismiss your fans, they put you where you are today. Young Tarpov for instance seems to have put us in a broken shuttle on the edge of known space. (FX: The DOCTOR sweeps debris from a console) Interesting... He sabotages a ship, just as Vandekyrian did to the Eurydice all those years ago.\nSENTIA: I’m here. I’m finally here... Omega’s ship. I used to read about it when I was just a girl. All the times I imagined standing here. This is like my dreams coming come true...\nOMEGA: Our marriage must take place as soon as possible, my dear, and then we can voyage forth and take thrones in our realm of nothingness...\nDOCTOR: Omega, you know I cannot agree to that... You can return to your universe, that’s fine,\nDOCTOR: but as far as I’m concerned it’s just a single ticket. You alone.\nSENTIA: You said you’d help us...\nDOCTOR: I said I'd help him. He knows you can’t go.\nSENTIA: Omega?\nOMEGA: I think what the Doctor is referring to is the dimensional instability which afflicts this\nOMEGA: sector of space... he knows only Time Lords can exist within its boundaries.\nSENTIA: But you fixed that. I’m here. Look, I’m fine.\nDOCTOR: Only as long as the Professor’s TARDIS and its dimensional circuit remains in place. For you to survive the journey, Ertikus will have to leave his TARDIS behind.\nSENTIA: Professor Ertikus is a huge fan of Omega. I’m sure if it were explained to him, he’d be-\nDOCTOR: But it’s not just that. There’s not just you here, there are other lives at stake on this ship, Daland... Ertikus... what’s going to happen to us when the Eurydice enters the other universe? Where do we go? We can’t leave in the shuttle now, can we? So if Ertikus’s TARDIS is immobilised, and if the shuttle is finished too, we can’t leave. And to make sure you survive your honeymoon...\nSENTIA: (Finishing his sentence for him) ... you’re all going to have to come through with us...\nDOCTOR: If you want to travel to another plane of existence, Sentia, that’s fine, but if other people\nDOCTOR: have to travel with you against their will, then I can’t help you, I’m sorry.\nOMEGA: But you will help us, Doctor... As long as Omega wills it, so will it be.\nDOCTOR: I think you'll find that, as long as I have the remote activator safe in my pocket, so won’t it be.\nOMEGA: (Flash of rage) Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: (Equally forcefully) Yes!!! Do you have something intelligent to say, or are you just going to\nDOCTOR: rage and threaten like the old Omega we know and love? I thought you were concerned at how the universe remembered you? Are you going to leave it as you entered it? Kicking and screaming and swearing bloody vengeance?\nOMEGA: (Reasonable again) You’re right, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you think is for the best. We\nOMEGA: cannot hold lives hostage to my... my...\nOMEGA: 41\nDOCTOR: Vainglorious folly?\nOMEGA: I was thinking... quixotic vision.\nDOCTOR: Couldn’t have put it better myself. I suggest before we discuss this further, we check the damage to the... Oh. He seems to have gone again. That’s quite an annoying habit of his.\nSENTIA: You shouldn’t have angered him, Doctor. He’s a noble hero, but he doesn’t suffer fools gladly.\nDOCTOR: Neither do I, Sentia. Neither do I.\nSENTIA: (Off mic) ’m just going to close down the engines manually. If there’s a breach they could explode.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Daland, they’ve both gone. You can stop pretending to be unconscious now.\nDALAND: (Off mic) How did you know?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen people unconscious before. I can tell.\nDALAND: Was that really-\nDOCTOR: Yes. The real thing. What do you make of him?\nDALAND: Not much, I’m afraid. After all, I had my eyes closed, keeping up the ‘nasty knock’ bit. (Beat) He’s completely mad isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: Very probably.\nDALAND: ‘Prancing fool’ indeed. Me! I’ve won three awards you know. They don’t give three awards\nDALAND: to prancing fools.\nDOCTOR: Come on. We have to find Tarpov.\nDALAND: Do we have to?\nDOCTOR: Yes we do. I don’t like what’s happening here. I’m being manipulated, and I don’t like it\nDOCTOR: one bit. So I think we should just slip quietly away in Ertikus’s TARDIS. And we can’t leave non-Time Lords behind, because if we do-\nDALAND: Yes, I heard. Somehow I don’t think Sentia wants to come.\nDOCTOR: Yes... Well, well cross that particular time bridge when we come to it. (Off mic) Come on. We have to hurry.\nDALAND: (Clears throat more meaningfully) Doctor! I am still tied to this chair you know. (Beat) Oh, well, once he realises, he’ll be back...\nDALAND: SCENE 40: ENGINE ROOM OF TOUR SHUTTLE.\nSENTIA: Omega...\nOMEGA: My dearest, Sentia... I... cannot stay long...\nSENTIA: I did what you said...\nSENTIA: OMEGA A temporary measure at best. I fear the Doctor will already be looking for a way off this\nSENTIA: ship... He is resourceful, Sentia. He is weakened by his conscience and feelings of obligation to me, but he is not a fool. I feel him getting nearer all the time, treading softly in my footprints. It is just a matter of time before he discovers that we intend to destroy him.\nSENTIA: What can we do?\nOMEGA: We must find a way to secure the Doctor’s cooperation, of course. We must compel him to leave this universe along with us.\nSENTIA: But what about the others? What about Daland and Ertikus? Omega? Omega!\nSENTIA: 42\nSENTIA: SCENE 41: EURYDICE.\nSCINTILLANS: Omegggaaa... .Deatthh.\nTARPOV: Yes, I know, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry...\nSCINTILLANS: Deattthhh...\nTARPOV: I’m sorry... I tried to save you, but it happened such a long time ago... I did try... (he starts to cry).\nSCINTILLANS: Ooommeeggaa...\nSCINTILLANS: SCENE 42: EURYDICE. CORRIDOR.\nSCINTILLANS: Atmos: echoey.\nDALAND: Doctor? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Very close) Yes?\nDALAND: You didn’t come back for me. I had to struggle manfully out of these ropes by myself, you know.\nDOCTOR: You’re here now, that’s all that matters.\nDALAND: Yes. No thanks to you. (Beat - then sigh) Big ship... !\nDOCTOR: Yes...\nDOCTOR: DALAND And spooky...\nDOCTOR: Not really. It’s just your overactive imagination conjuring up an irrational fear of the\nDOCTOR: unknown, that’s all.\nDALAND: Oh, good. As long as it’s my fault.\nDOCTOR: You know, there’s one thing I’m not clear on - Sentia said something about you\nDOCTOR: conducting the marriage ceremony... I was under the impression you were an actor.\nDALAND: (Sighs) 1 played a priest in Hearts in Orbit - and the network had me ordained one season for a publicity stunt.\nDOCTOR: How tasteful.\nDALAND: It’s the industry one finds oneself working in.\nDOCTOR: You're taking all this very calmly, you know.\nDALAND: That’s because I’ve got a special inbuilt defence against emotional trauma and extreme\nDALAND: situations of this kind.\nDALAND: DOCTOR And what’s that?\nDALAND: I’m very shallow.\nDOCTOR: Ah. (Beat) Omega seemed extremely interested in Tarpov, didn’t he?\nDALAND: I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Particularly about what he might have said to Sentia. I don’t suppose you were conscious\nDOCTOR: enough to hear Tarpov say anything interesting?\nDALAND: No, I was out like a light. First thing I remember was coming to, and hearing him screaming the odds about ‘He’s here! He’s coming!’ and then he ran off and then- hey, wait a minute. I’ve\nDALAND: just realised. Doctor-\nDOCTOR: Shhh! (FX: Footsteps) There’s something coming... Just around this corner.\nDALAND: Tarpov?\nDOCTOR: Who else... Get ready to grab him...\nDOCTOR: 43\nDALAND: Right.\nDOCTOR: After three. One... Two... Thr-\nDOCTOR: GLINDA At last... We have been wandering around this great big monstrosity of a place for some considerable time, and you’re the first member of staff we’ve met. It’s just not good enough. Is it, Mave?\nMAVEN: What?\nGLINDA: Great big monstrosity, Mave.\nMAVEN: Oh, yes!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nDALAND: They must have been sitting in the first-class lounge, got off when we docked.\nDOCTOR: This is all I need...\nGLINDA: Where are the refreshments, dear? The service here is rubbish!\nDOCTOR: (Hisses) Leave this to me... (Clears throat) Well, ladies, I do believe there is an impressive\nDOCTOR: range of in-flight snacks back on the shuttle - if 1 could escort you?\nGLINDA: Now that’s more like it.\nDOCTOR: (Under breath) ll take them back to Sentia on the tour shuttle. Youll be all right here, won’t you?\nDALAND: (Away from mic) Well, not really...\nDOCTOR: Come along, ladies...\nGLINDA: So is this bit of the Heritage Centre meant to look like a ten thousand-year-old spaceship, is it?\nDOCTOR: Er... yes...\nGLINDA: Doesn’t look very old. Does it, Mave?\nMAVEN: What?\nGLINDA: Doesn’t look very old, Mave.\nMAVEN: Ooh! Thank you!\nGLINDA: It’s not right, is itP Look at this dust! They’ve used dust, haven’t they? Dust never looks\nGLINDA: like dust. The Historium on Stelgin IV uses treated neo-cordralite, and that looks far more like dust than dust ever does...\nDOCTOR: (Wearily) Really...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 43: EURYDICE. CORRIDOR. Atmos: the SCINTILLANS are still hovering in their ghostly way.\nTARPOV: So sorry... I’m so sorry...\nOMEGA: Vandekyrian...\nTARPOV: Omega... You’ve come to kill me.\nOMEGA: Yes.\nTARPOV: Like all the others... Yes, that makes sense. Yes, that makes sense. Scintillans... wait for\nTARPOV: me... I’m going to join you now... Wait for me...\nSCINTILLANS: Omegaaaa... Death... Death...\nSCINTILLANS: Death, death, death, death, death! (Their voices scream to a crescendo)\nSCINTILLANS: SCENE 44. EURYDICE. CORRIDOR.\nSCINTILLANS: 44\nDALAND: (Hissing to himself) Doctor, where are you? You've been hours! Well, half an hour. Twenty minutes, Ill give you that.\nDALAND: down the corridor.\nDALAND: Who’s there? Doctor, is that you?\nERTIKUS: (Whimpering, on mic) Over there... on the floor...\nDALAND: Professor Ertikus! What’s wrong?\nERTIKUS: I... think it’s that poor actor who removed his own hand...\nDALAND: Yes, it is... Oh, hell...\nERTIKUS: It’s horrible...\nDOCTOR: (On mic) What’s going on?\nDALAND: It’s Tarpov! Poor boy - he was only doing this season to put himself through college. I\nDALAND: rather hoped I’d never see him again after I that incident with the medical robot but I didn’t want this.\nDOCTOR: What ‘incident’?\nDALAND: After that thing with the waste disposal machine, we left him in that room. When Sentia and I returned, we found that the medical robot was blown apart. Bits of it were all over the place, even down the corridor. It looked like someone had dragged a body out through the mess it made.\nDOCTOR: Really.\nDALAND: We thought Tarpov’d had attacked you, Doctor, and stuffed you somewhere. So someone actually dragged him out, you reckon?\nDOCTOR: No. There’s no fragments on his clothes. He wasn’t dragged out of there. My guess is that someone attacked him, and the medical robot attacked the attacker...\nDOCTOR: DALAND And someone else dragged the attacker out?\nERTIKUS: This is making my head hurt.\nDOCTOR: Ah! (FX: Clatter as he picks something up) Here we are. The culprit. A Finklegruber probe... A very powerful instrument, like a miniature laser lance. A quick blow to the heart by the look of it...\nDALAND: Where did that lance thing come from?\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s easy. From Ertikus’s toolbag... which I foolishly left open and unattended in the Eurydice control room.\nERTIKUS: How can you two be so... calm?\nDALAND: (Odd voice) Doctor... Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Yes...?\nDALAND: His other hand. That’s gone, too...\nBRTIKUS: Oh, my g-\nDOCTOR: I should have known... Daland, be a good chap and see if you can find it lying around.\nDALAND: Find... hand... but I... Oh, all right. (Moving off) So it comes to this, hunting for severed hands in the dark...\nDOCTOR: Professor, you remember when Tarpov went mad? We noticed the similarity to the ancient\nDOCTOR: and venerable saga of Gallifrey-\nERTIKUS: (Babbling) 1 remember you not reading my book...\nDOCTOR: Remember the next part of the story. ERTIKUS The next part of the- oh, yes, I see what you mean... ‘And then when Vandekyrian did\nDOCTOR: offer his severed hand to Omega, Omega in his rage did not accept it, and said his betrayal was too great... (Realising) And he did strike off Vandekyrian’s other hand and smote him n dead.’\nDOCTOR: Now it’s starting to make a little bit of sense. We now know why the waste disposal was\nDOCTOR: 45\nDOCTOR: switched off. Someone wanted to stop him destroying his other hand.\nERTIKUS: Someone wanted his hand? Why?\nDOCTOR: I think the clue’s in the next bit... ‘And in his remorse Omega did...’\nERTIKUS: ‘And in his remorse at what he had done, Omega did place Vandekyrian’s remaining\nERTIKUS: hand in the stellar manipulator so that he would have a hand in the great project that he had helped bring into being. And henceforth the stellar manipulator was known to all as “the Hand of Omega”.’\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was never quite sure why it was called the ‘Hand of Omega’. I mean, why not the ‘Hand of Vandekyrian’?\nERTIKUS: Most of these things boil down to politics. Vandekyrian was not very popular at the time as you could imagine, neither was Rassilon, who was thought by many to be behind Vandekyrian. Rassilon was a politician. Now, what does any politician do when a bitter rival dies in glorious circumstances?\nDOCTOR: What else? Honour him up to the eyeballs. How can the followers of Omega attack you when you're painting yourself as his greatest fan ever?\nERTIKUS: Exactly. But I’m not sure how this helps us. Doctor, there is a maniac running rampant...\nDOCTOR: He’s not running anywhere. He - or she - is amongst us, and isn’t going anywhere. Now, who would want to crudely act out the legend of Omega? Someone obsessed with Omega. Professor?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps someone who knows the legend inside out?\nERTIKUS: Doctor - just because it was my laser probe - I hope I you’re not implying that I would- (Hisses) Daland! It must be Daland.\nDOCTOR: Must it?\nERTIKUS: Facts, Doctor. Why did Tarpov destroy his own hand? Because he thought he was\nERTIKUS: Vandekyrian. Who cut off Vandekyrian’s other hand? Omega. Daland acts as Omega. Therefore, Daland is the murderer. There you go, Doctor, QED.\nDOCTOR: Hmm...\nDOCTOR: ERTIKUS And you said yourself, someone is crudely acting out the legend of Omega. And there’s no\nDOCTOR: one more used to crudely acting out the legend of Omega than Daland...\nDALAND: (Off mic) Doctor, I’d like a word with you. Over here.\nDOCTOR: Coming, Mr. Daland. Voins DALAND) Certainly, what about?\nDALAND: I think he did it. Ertikus.\nDOCTOR: Did what?\nDALAND: Killed Tarpov, of course. Come on, Doctor, it doesn’t take a genius to see that the\nDALAND: murderer is pretending to be Omega. Take it from someone’s who’s pretended to be Omega for years...\nDALAND: It’s obviously someone who’s obsessed with the legends. That’s ‘obsessed’ pronounced ‘stark staring\nDALAND: bonkers’...\nDOCTOR: Really?\nDALAND: Actor’s intuition, Doctor. The old fossil’s been studying Omega all his life. He’s been\nDALAND: telling me about his life’s ambition, to find this ship. Do you know he’s been planning this expedition\nDALAND: for years? If that’s not obsessed I don’t know what is.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s a very interesting... theory.\nDALAND: He'll be wearing silly hats and leaping into the nearest black hole next.\nDOCTOR: Hmm... Yes... Perhaps we’re looking at this the wrong way. Let’s have a look at what’s\nDOCTOR: actually happened. Tarpov is attacked. Tarpov is killed. Between those two events he smuggles himself aboard a shuttle. Why? Omega is outraged at the very idea that Tarpov might have said to Sentia. Why?\nDALAND: He smuggled himself onto the shuttle to tell Sentia something, so... Omega killed him\nDALAND: to shut him up.\nDALAND: 46\nDOCTOR: (Wearily) Daland... Omega happens to be a non-corporeal mass of psionic ectoplasm.\nDALAND: Oh, yeah.\nDOCTOR: But, maybe... Perhaps he wasn’t deluded. Perhaps he knew something about Omega. Are you sure you didn’t hear what Tarpov said to Sentia on the shuttle?\nDALAND: No, no, all I heard. Oh- no! That’s what I wanted to tell you, Doctor, but I forgot all about it when the old crones turned up. About, the shuttle controls being blasted. I don’t think Tarpov did it.\nDOCTOR: He used the gun to blow up the intercom. Why do you think he didn’t blow up the cockpit as well?\nDALAND: Well, I had my eyes closed and everything, but I could have sworn I heard the flare gun\nDALAND: get fired again after Tarpov ran out...\nDOCTOR: Really? Oh, I see. Of course. Of course. Maybe Omega couldn’t have killed Tarpov... But there is another possibility... Right, I'll just be a few minutes. (Louder now) Don’t go away, will you?\nDOCTOR: Stay with Ertikus.\nDALAND: (Hissing) Doctor, you can’t be serious, he might be the killer!\nDOCTOR: (Hissing) 1 doubt it...\nERTIKUS: (Off mic) Wait a minute!!!\nDOCTOR: Don’t forget you two! Stay together!\nDOCTOR: DALAND/ERTIKUS You can’t leave me with-\nDALAND: Well...\nERTIKUS: Erm...\nDALAND: I think I have to...\nERTIKUS: Yes... I think... So dol...\nDALAND: Yes...\nERTIKUS: But he did tell us to...\nDALAND: Stay together, didn’t he?\nDALAND: DALAND/ERTIKUS Yeees...\nERTIKUS: There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you... Why are you here... On this ship? I thought that the Doctor and I were the only-\nDALAND: Oh, we’re just here to conduct the marriage ceremony.\nERTIKUS: What? Marriage?\nDALAND: Oh, didn’t you know? That’s why we’re here. Sentia’s getting married to the ghost of Omega. And they’re setting up house in a world of anti-matter.\nERTIKUS: (Scared of DALAND) Oh... really?\nDALAND: I suppose I should look on the bright side. Saves me buying them a toaster.\nERTIKUS: That’s... very interesting. Thanks for telling me. (To himself) He’s completely off his chump...\nDALAND: What have you been doing...?\nERTIKUS: Ooooh, I’ve just been hunting out the Scintillans. Oh, do you remember? Tarpov\nERTIKUS: mentioned Scintillans? Well, I’ve seen them. They’re big ghostly transparent creatures who float around\nERTIKUS: this ship screeching like nails on a blackboard.\nDALAND: Oh, right. Anyone else seen these... Scintillans?\nERTIKUS: Oh, no... Just me.\nDALAND: Oh, I see. I see (under his breath) Mad as an Ion storm...\nDALAND: 47\nDALAND: SCENE 45: TOUR SHUTTLE. CARGO HOLD.\nOMEGA: My dearest, Sentia... success! The Doctor has delivered to us the means of his own downfall. He now has no choice but to follow us into our universe. Nothing can keep us from eternity\nOMEGA: together. Nothing. Take this device, it is our key to our new realm.\nSENTIA: Omega - about the others here, they can’t stay here, can they...?\nOMEGA: Why not? I’m sure they will find it most interesting.\nSENTIA: You- you're not going to harm them, are you? They can go...\nOMEGA: Stop your incessant bleating, girl! Do you think I could hurt them?\nSENTIA: Well, you tried to hurt Tarpov.\nOMEGA: He was unhelpful to our plan.\nSENTIA: But - oh, never mind.\nOMEGA: You can say what is in your mind to me, my dear...We are to be married, after all. Now, do\nOMEGA: you really think I would hurt anyone?\nSENTIA: (Obviously not completely convinced) No.\nDOCTOR: What a good question.\nSENTIA: Doctor... I...\nOMEGA: He obviously has something to say, my dear. Best we let him say it so he can leave us in peace.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I do indeed have ‘something to say’... Tarpov is dead.\nSENTIA: Oh, no! How?\nDOCTOR: Murdered, of course. Stabbed through the heart. His other hand was severed and removed.\nSENTIA: Oh... Oh, no... Tarpov, poor Tarpov. (Stifled sob)\nOMEGA: And, Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Well I was just saying to Ertikus, someone here has been re-enacting old stories, and it’s\nDOCTOR: obvious that someone has an unhealthy obsession with the legend of Omega. And who else is more obsessed with the legend of Omega than Omega himself?\nOMEGA: Why would I hurt this man? He was nothing to me.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, Omega. He kidnaps and threatens your precious Sentia? You rage about him telling something to Sentia? What j was it about? Those pesky Scintillans?\nOMEGA: Look at me, Doctor, I am as insubstantial as the air. I can do nothing. What can I do in\nOMEGA: this state?\nDOCTOR: That’s what I thought at first, but then I thought, perhaps you have an agent to do your bidding. Sentia, perhaps.\nSENTIA: Me? But why...?\nDOCTOR: Someone attacked Tarpov back on the Heritage Centre... Oh, and it was you who disabled the shuttle, wasn’t it, Sentia? What’s going on?\nSENTIA: This is starting to turn into a bit of a nightmare.\nSENTIA: DOCTOR A bit? Listen to Omega’s words, Sentia. Think about what’s happening here. You can’t leave with him, you know. He will tire j of you... And then he'll destroy you.\nSENTIA: I didn’t kill Tarpov, you know...\nDOCTOR: Somehow Omega found a way, even without your help. He is mad, you know.\nSENTIA: I really want to see Omega’s universe. We have such plans...\nDOCTOR: (Tenderly) ’m sure you do. But you can find happiness in this one, you know. It’s not a\nDOCTOR: 48\nDOCTOR: bad old cosmos. Flowers, cups of tea, trees, mugs of tea, sunsets, pots of tea... as you can see, I don’t\nDOCTOR: expect too much from this universe...\nSENTIA: (Laughs) Oh, Doctor, it’s too late. Omega and I... We’ve come too far to turn back now.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s not. Ertikus and Daland are waiting for us. All we have to do is collect the two old ladies and all leave in Ertikus’s TARDIS.\nSENTIA: Sorry? What? What ladies?\nSENTIA: DOCTOR The ladies from the tour shuttle. I brought them to you.\nSENTIA: You didn’t...\nDOCTOR: I... didn’t?\nOMEGA: (Chuckles)\nDOCTOR: Omega...\nOMEGA: Let me tell you a story, Doctor. Once upon a time, there were two little old ladies.\nDOCTOR: Enough games, Omega... What is going on?\nDOCTOR: OMEGA And they lived happily ever after. Or they would have done. But, sadly, the wicked Doctor\nDOCTOR: left them to die in the heart of a dead ship.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 46: CHAMBER IN THE EURYDICE. Atmos: deep echo.\nGLINDA: (Very echoey) Now this looks more like it. Very authentic. Dusty, filthy and old... (Raises voice) Echoey, too...\nMAVEN: What?\nMAVEN: The words ‘echoey too’ roll back and hit them again.\nMAVEN: (Getting them on the rebound) Oh, yes!\nGLINDA: Well, I do believe that strange-looking man has locked us in here. Well, that’s not on, is\nGLINDA: it? We didn’t get locked in a dark room on Haltropus IV, did we? No... And Haltropus IV was rubbish.\nGLINDA: Well, this is no good. We could be here for hours. As luck would have it I have a little device in my pocket that7l sort us out...\nGLINDA: Care for a game of five-dimensional cribbage, Mave?\nMAVEN: Oh, yes!\nMAVEN: SCENE 47: TOUR SHUTTLE. CARGO HOLD.\nDOCTOR: Where are they?\nOMEGA: Safe, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, I want proof so I’m going to... Wait. The remote activator. Where is it? I had ita\nDOCTOR: moment ago. It was in my pocket. It’s gone...\nOMEGA: It’s safe, too. A moral dilemma for you, Doctor. Stay with us, and you give everyone here the possibility of another existence in another cosmos. Leave, and you condemn your precious humans to\nOMEGA: certain obliteration.\nDOCTOR: (Evenly) Where is it?\nOMEGA: (Mockingly) Sentia, he wants to know where it is...\nSENTIA: No...\nSENTIA: 49\nDOCTOR: Please, give me the activator.\nOMEGA: (Chuckles) Now, Sentia, you can give me back the device, if you please.\nSENTIA: No! You're going to hurt them! I knew it! All your promises! You want to take them all through with us! You don’t care what happens to them!\nOMEGA: Sentia, I promise, I will let your friends go free.\nDOCTOR: Don’t believe him. He’s mad, Sentia. He always was and he always will be.\nOMEGA: You've tried to goad me before, Doctor. It will not happen again.\nOMEGA: SCENE 48: EURYDICE. CORRIDOR.\nERTIKUS: What was that?\nDALAND: Sounds like the shuttle’s PA...\nDOCTOR: (Over Tannoy) Sentia, I want you to listen carefully... this is very important...\nDALAND: It’s the Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (Over Tannoy) Those two ladies are in danger! They’re somewhere on this ship and we have to find them. We’ve got to get everyone back to the TARDIS and leave here. Let Omega take his Journey alone.\nSENTIA: (Over Tannoy) Doctor, we can’t go against Omega.\nOMEGA: (Over Tannoy) Indeed, Doctor, surely you wouldn’t try and destroy a harmonious\nOMEGA: relationship such as ours? A relationship that Sentia clearly wants.\nDALAND: He’s rigged the cargo hold’s Tannoy to broadcast through both ships! I think he’s sending us a message... Clever old, Doctor...\nERTIKUS: Did she say... Omega? It is! That’s... That’s Omega! I’ve studied the Pre-Rassilon data extracts... I know that voice anywhere...\nDALAND: I know it is, I told you. I think the Doctor wants us to find the old ladies... Come on, Ertikus, we’ve got to do what he says, get everyone back to your TARDIS...\nERTIKUS: What? You must be joshing. You don’t understand, sir. This is the chance of several lifetimes... (Off mic) You look for them, Daland, I'll be back soon...\nDALAND: Prof!!! 1 really wouldn't...\nDALAND: SCENE 49: TOUR SHUTTLE COCKPIT.\nDOCTOR: Please, Sentia, it’s vital! I need the activator!\nSENTIA: I can’t! I can’t give it to either of you! Don’t you see! Don’t you see? (Screams) Omega! You’re hurting.\nOMEGA: You are my bright star, Sentia, if you defy me then there is nothing left for either of us.\nOMEGA: Do you understand? Nothing! Cries of SENTIA as OMEGA takes the device off her.\nDOCTOR: Sentia, get out of here.\nSENTIA: I can’t...\nDOCTOR: I’m in no mood to argue! (FX: Door) 1 don’t understand, Omega. You’re supposed to be a\nDOCTOR: mass of psychic energy. How did you take the device off her like that? How can you hold it in your hand?\nOMEGA: Why, it’s magic, Doctor. I can’t tell you how it’s done. The magic might stop working. And I can do more than hold it, Doctor. Look, I can press the buttons. (FX: Bleeps) Not bad for a ghostly\nOMEGA: 50\nOMEGA: presence, I’m sure you will agree. Just one pulse from this machine... And we can begin our great\nOMEGA: odyssey...\nERTIKUS: (Off mic) Doctor, Doctor, is that you?\nDOCTOR: Ertikus, what are you doing here?\nEX: Whirr of VIDIBOT accompanies ERTIKUS into room.\nERTIKUS: (On mic) You’ve not been entirely honest with me, have you, Doctor? I heard you, Doctor. I heard you talking to Omega.\nDOCTOR: Professor, now what makes you think...\nERTIKUS: Don’t try and bluster with me, Doctor. I’m a four-star blusterer myself, with en suite\nERTIKUS: prevarication. He’s here, isn’t he? While I’m running around corridors like an idiot trying to unravel the\nERTIKUS: mystery of Omega, you're taking tea with the chap.\nDOCTOR: It’s not like that.\nERTIKUS: Then tell me what it is like, Doctor. I heard you talking to him. I want to talk to him.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that’s a good idea.\nERTIKUS: He’s here, isn’t he? Don’t you see what this means to me? I want to know. I’m tired of\nERTIKUS: assuming from sources and extrapolating from dog-eared documents. I Just want to know.\nOMEGA: Do you, Professor? Well here I am. Right here in front of you.\nERTIKUS: What? No! No, it can’t be! You’re not!\nOMEGA: Ask me your question, Professor, and I will answer.\nDOCTOR: Omega, leave him alone...\nOMEGA: Ask me! You want to know about the Scintillans, Professor? I killed them. I killed them\nOMEGA: all. And do you know why? Do you want to know my secret? My secret is that I am mad. There. Now you\nOMEGA: know. (Suddenly vicious} Now you can die happy!\nERTIKUS: (Strangulated) Doctor... Please... Help... Help... Stop...\nDOCTOR: No, Omega, you can’t!\nOMEGA: (Strained) Get off me, Doctor, do not interfere!\nDOCTOR: Please! (FX: Prof’s neck is broken. Body hits the floor) Oh, no... (Bends down to examine ERTIKUS)\nDOCTOR: That was his last body! What have you... He was harmless!\nOMEGA: He was a nosy old fool. He would have found out about the Scintillans and told the universe. He would have told... her...\nDOCTOR: That’s it? That he might find out your guilty secret, whatever it is? Is any secret worth a life? You have completely severed your link with reality, Omega...\nOMEGA: It is for you to acknowledge reality, Doctor. I have the activator.\nDOCTOR: If you decide to use that, and this ship starts to move into your universe, I promise you, I will take everyone I can and leave in the TARDIS, innocent lives or no innocent lives. And that includes Sentia.\nOMEGA: Then I will make a deal with you. Join Sentia and I on the Other side of existence, and I will let your human friends go. We will put them into the shuttle and leave them spinning in space. I’m sure they can clear this sector and get rescued by a passing vessel.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t keep your side of the bargain for a moment...\nOMEGA: Oh, I would. You see, my dear Doctor, they are more than mere hostages. They are my audience. They can tell all that they saw Omega, the great King of Time, leave for his eternal realm with his gracious Queen, with just one person who believes enough to speak up for omega and to live their life\nOMEGA: with him... You see, Doctor, how I am perceived is all I have left, and I will... I will... be perceived as a\nOMEGA: 51\nOMEGA: king.\nOMEGA: 52"

I seem to have arrived a little late...\nDOCTOR: Now OMEGA is revealed, and the ‘DOCTOR’ confronts the fact that he is OMEGA too. His voice becomes ‘blurred’ as he slips from the DOCTOR'S voice to OMEGA’S. There’s a muttering of voices in the background, to highlight the confusion in\nDOCTOR: his identity.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Omega...\nOMEGA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I must say, it is very nice to see a familiar face. And you I can’t get a more familiar face\nDOCTOR: than the one you've got there. I see you survived our little visit to Amsterdam.\nOMEGA: But at a terrible cost, Doctor. My mind was fractured, smashed into fragments. I was left with somewhat of an identity crisis.\nDOCTOR: Quite a common complaint for those who visit Amsterdam, I gather.\nOMEGA: But it worked, Doctor, it worked. The attempt to enter this universe using your bio- imprint was a success! A success beyond imaginings, Doctor! (Laughs insanely) Oh, Doctor... Doctor... (OMEGA’S voice submerges, the DOCTOR'S voice emerges) Doctor... is that you? Is that you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s me.\nOMEGA: (As DOCTOR) Thank goodness you're here! The Time Lords received my message...\nDOCTOR: (Warily) Yes, yes we did.\nOMEGA: I must say I didn’t expect them to send another Doctor. But... then again... using two\nOMEGA: Doctors to defeat Omega... Well... it’s been done before, hasn’t it...?\nDOCTOR: Yes...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/ OMEGA (Together) 1 remember...\nOMEGA: (DOCTOR) We’ve got to combine our wills to defeat him, Doctor... We have to... be careful... He’s quite insane... Quite mad...\nDOCTOR: (Sadly - talking over OMEGA) Don’t you worry, Doctor, I’ll be careful... You just - look after yourself...\nOMEGA: Quite mad... Quite mad... Quite... Quite... (OMEGA’S voice takes over) Quite a success... Eh,\nOMEGA: Doctor? (Laughs) A 200 per cent success! Not only did I get your body, but your mind as well...\nDOCTOR: Buy one, get one free... Well, I always thought about giving you a piece of my mind, but never to this extent.\nOMEGA: (His voice strains) Amusing... is it not, Doctor? When we first met I asked you to share the burden of my world. Now I am in this one, we share everything... Everything... Everything... (His voice fades and dies)\nDOCTOR: Omega! Oh, no... (Strains.) Help me keep him upright...\nSENTIA: Is he all right?\nOMEGA: (Low rumbling groan)\nOMEGA: 53\nDOCTOR: For the moment. The pocket of dimensional instability in this part of space doesn’t usually affect Time Lords, but Omega’s got a healthy dose of instability of his own to contend with... Well,\nDOCTOR: Daland, I expect you’re about to say something which goes along the lines of ‘What on earth is going on?’\nDALAND: Yes, although there were going to be a few more expletives in there, but that’s about the gist of it...\nDOCTOR: I think I’m about to say something along the lines of ‘It’s a long story’... You see...\nDOCTOR: Omega... This chap... here... Well, it all started...\nSENTIA: He wanted to escape from his world of anti-matter and to get into this one. He developed a plan, which involved using the Doctor’s physical bio-imprint to create a ‘positive’ body. The Time Lords assumed that he failed and Omega was destroyed on Earth, but the experiment succeeded. Unfortunately, it worked too well. It transferred the Doctor’s psychic imprint as well as his physical one. Omega ended up with two personalities inside the same body...\nDOCTOR: Ah, well done, Sentia...Very well explained... I could use someone like you on a\nDOCTOR: permanent basis... Daland, do you think we can get him into my TARDIS...\nDALAND: Tl have a go...\nDOCTOR: He might be less prone to the dimensional stresses and strains inside there...\nOMEGA: (Sluggish) No... No... TARDIS... Take this...\nDOCTOR: What’s this?\nSENTIA: It controls the engines of the Eurydice, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So it is. An electronic activator, bypassing the symbiotic ignition. Just what I’d have done.\nDOCTOR: (To OMEGA) You want me to send you back to where you once belonged, I take it...\nOMEGA: Take the... prancing... fool...\nOMEGA: DOCTOR The who?\nDALAND: (Unamused) He means me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Does he? Well, prancing fool, you heard him, prance into the TARDIS.\nDALAND: You're not planning to help him, are you?\nDOCTOR: Well, I can’t refuse a handsome chap like this, can I?\nDALAND: You don’t know what he’s done! He’s murdered Tarpov and Ertikus! He’s a monster! DOCTOR And would you prefer this murdering monster to be here with us in our universe, or\nDALAND: safely tucked up in a nice little universe of his own?\nDALAND: Ah. I see your logic there - but what about Sentia? She wants to go with him. She can’t, can she?\nSENTIA: But I can now, don’t you see? You can all leave, and the Professor’s TARDIS will keep me\nSENTIA: safe until Omega and I are in our new home.\nDALAND: She’s as mad as he is! Doctor, tell her...\nSENTIA: It’s my choice, Doctor. My decision.\nDOCTOR: It would be intolerably dangerous.\nSENTIA: Look, we’ve been working towards this for a long time. He won’t be mad on the other side.\nSENTIA: His will can take control again-\nDALAND: What kind of-\nSENTIA: He'll be sane. He won’t be a monster, he won’t hurt people any more. He'll be well again.\nDALAND: But y-\nSENTIA: Don’t worry about me, Daland.\nDALAND: Me - worried? I- I’m not... oh, I am, aren’t IP I am concerned. Do you know, I think that’s\nDALAND: the first genuine emotion I’ve had a proper go at?\nDALAND: 54\nSENTIA: (Warmly) Don’t think I’m not flattered that you decided to waste it on me.\nDOCTOR: (Harrumphing to break the moment) Now, I gather there are some people kept in some sort of hostage situation. I don’t think we can leave without them, can we?\nOMEGA: (From floor. Getting strength back) I will... take you...to where they are concealed... It is not far...\nDOCTOR: (Straining) Good. Up we get again. Omega, if you’re inhabiting an exact copy of my body, then I think I need to lose a bit of weight...\nOMEGA: Thank you, Doctor... (FX: Dull metallic scraping which echoes around the corridors) What was that?\nDOCTOR: (Moving off mic) Nothing...\nDALAND: (Whispering) You know what that sounded like...?\nSENTIA: (Whispering) What?\nDALAND: (Whispering) Like a ship docking... Someone’s come to rescue us...\nSENTIA: (To herself) No... It can’t be.\nDALAND: (Hissing) Yes... At last we’re getting out of this madhouse!\nSENTIA: (Out loud) Omega, it’s a ship!\nDALAND: (Still whispering) What are you doing? Shut up!\nSENTIA: It’s a ship! It’s just docked with us!\nOMEGA: Doctor, have you betrayed me?\nDOCTOR: No, Omega...\nOMEGA: You have brought Time Lords with you to take me bade and answer for my crimes!\nDOCTOR: What crimes? Think! Why would Time Lords bother docking? Eh? If I brought Time Lords\nDOCTOR: we wouldn’t hear ships clanging together would we? Wouldn’t we hear TARDISes?\nDOCTOR: Drawn-out dematerialisation noise, quiet at first then growing in volume.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nOMEGA: Doctor, you lie! You have betrayed me! (Off mic) No one is putting me on trial for genocide, Doctor! No one is erasing Omega from the time line! Tell your precious High Council that!\nSENTIA: Wait!\nDALAND: Sentia, leave him! (Shouts) Sentia!\nDOCTOR: Leave her, Daland... She’s made her decision.\nDALAND: (His voice distorts) But he could do anything to her in that state... Doctor... Doctor... what’s happening?\nDALAND: From this point, DALAND’s voice is slightly distorted, the DOCTOR'S voice remains normal.\nDOCTOR: (Off mic) Look at that TARDIS. That’s Ertikus’s, isn’t itP You see the way it’s flickering like that?\nDALAND: Yes...\nDOCTOR: Some TARDISes tend not to hang around if the operators... ah, depart. There’s this symbiotic link thing, they get awfully attached to their owners.\nDALAND: (Sounding distinctly queasy) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. Most TARDISes spend millennia grieving - some just hurl themselves into the\nDOCTOR: Vortex, never to be seen again. Somewhere at the end of time there’s an elephants’ graveyard of broken capsules. I always meant to go and have a look one day...\nDALAND: Doctor, I’m feeling very strange...\nDOCTOR: That TARDIS is the one thing keeping this area of space free from dimensional\nDOCTOR: interference. We’ve got to persuade it to stay or you and the others will be torn apart...\nDOCTOR: 55\nDOCTOR: SCENE 51: EURYDICE. CORRIDOR.\nEX: Warping weird sound is heard throughout the ship, probably based on TARDIS noise.\nSENTIA: Omega, what’s happening? I... can’t... focus... The walls are changing... The ship... ’m getting swallowed by the ship...\nOMEGA: So, you want to try to punish me? You can infest all recorded history with your piety... (DOCTOR) But I, Omega, will defy you...\nOMEGA: (OMEGA) No, no... Not the Time Lords... It’s them, they’ve found me... (DOCTOR) They’ve found us...\nEX: The whispering builds into the huge ‘SCINTILLAN’ shrieking sound we heard in Part Two.\nOMEGA: (OMEGA) Leave me... (DOCTOR) Leave us... (OMEGA) alone!\nSCINTILLANS: (Variety of high floaty voices) Omega... Omega... Why did you kill us? Was it something we said? Was it something we did? Who are you to do this to us?\nOMEGA: I am... I am not... (As DOCTOR) But I am... not... Omega... I am... the Doctor... I am (OMEGA) Lord of lime, the (DOCTOR) Doctor, the saviour of the Time Lords... Omega, the (OMEGA) Protector of Gallifrey... 1am (DOCTOR) the Doctor...? Iam not... Omega... Iam not a rat, or a cat or a bat... (OMEGA) I am... a mole and I live in a hole...\nSCINTILLANS: Who are you to do this? Who are you?\nOMEGA: (DOCTOR) I am... we are... (OMEGA) I don’t know.\nOMEGA: can be a distorted version of another cast member, or just anyone knocking around the studio...\nOMEGA: SCINTILLAN’ Who are you? Who are you to do this? (Voice changes to CARDINAL LUVIS) Who are you to do this? In my class? Peylix! Peylix!I'm talking to you boy!\nOMEGA: SCENE 52: EURYDICE.\nDALAND: (Less distorted) 1 feel a bit better...\nDOCTOR: That’s because you're near the source of the dimensional stability... Unfortunately it might not be around for much longer... (Shouts to TARDIS) Oh, come on, old girl, life goes on! There’s a\nDOCTOR: whole universe to explore, places to go, people to see. Come on, help me...\nDALAND: Um, yeah... You'll meet another Time Lord I’m sure...! You’re very good looking for your age...\nDOCTOR: (To DALAND, exasperated) What did you say?\nDALAND: Sorry...\nDOCTOR: Come on, you're not old, you’re a classic! Your rotor might be a bit rusty round the edges,\nDOCTOR: but you know what they say: there’s many i a good interstitial vortex field maintained on an old relative continuum stabiliser...\nDOCTOR: It’s no good, she’s too upset. They must have been together a very long time. Come on! Back to the TARDIS! My TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 53: CORRIDORS OF THE EURYDICE.\nDOCTOR: 56\nLUVIS: This is your Chronological Studies paper, is it not?\nOMEGA: (Either sounds or acts younger) Sir, if this is about hiding that warp ellipse field generator in my desk...\nLUVIS: No, Peylix... Giving yourself three years to complete a three-hour examination paper\nLUVIS: shows a scintilla of initiative, at least. I’m, talking about what you wrote, boy... The Genefrenian’s theory of temporal ageing...P Would you like to explain, Peylix?\nOMEGA: Yes, sir, the theory states that time itself, like everything else, ages - that time itself is curved because it has started to bend like an old man’s spine.\nLUVIS: (Impatient) Yes, yes...\nOMEGA: They say if we can isolate where time is oldest, we can secure, control and map out history for ourselves... like finding a worn’ out hole in a coat and then using it to sew on a button. There’s this place they know, they call it the sector of forgotten souls, if we could detonate a star in that area-\nLUVIS: I didn’t ask you to outline the damn thing again! I’m asking you why you ignored my teachings and instead had the nerve to use your exam paper to peddle some tin-plated mongrel theory from a lesser species!\nOMEGA: I thought the Genefrenian theory was interesting...\nLUVIS: No lesser species understand time the way we do, young Peylix. That is why we call them ‘lesser species’. That is why the cosmic sciences are our core curriculum and the rest of the universe, its history, its species and its cultures, all come under the umbrella title of ‘General Studies’.\nOMEGA: But I think it could work!\nLUVIS: You are a dangerous young man, Peylix, with dangerous ideas, and I will make sure you never get any opportunity to try them out. To this end I am not giving you a simple delta fail - just in case some deluded Cardinal gives you the opportunity to retake your exams.\nOMEGA: S-sorry?\nLUVIS: You are very honoured Peylix, this grade, though theoretically possible, has never actually been issued to a student in the history of the Academy... The lowest grade possible. Do you know what it means? It means you will never rise to the first rank. Do you know what grade, I mean...?\nOMEGA: Yes, sir...\nOMEGA: Reality starts to intrude on the scene. SENTIA is in the distance, calling to him.\nSENTIA: Omega! Omega! Omega! Back to dreamlike state.\nOMEGA: Omega...\nOMEGA: SCENE 54: TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Right, got to be a bit of a rush job this... I only hope it’s not too late...\nDALAND: Come on, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (Exasperated) I’m not playing the xylophone here, Daland! It involves a lot of circuit\nDOCTOR: rejigging to- ah! That should do it... Just takes a bit of know-how, that’s all...\nDALAND: That’s better... I felt like I was turning inside out for a minute there...\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s a very simple scientific reason for that... You were being turned inside out...\nDOCTOR: Shame about the Professor’s TARDIS... She was just too upset.\nDOCTOR: 57\nDALAND: Well, that’s the way it goes. Girls get upset about me all the time.\nDOCTOR: Really? ‘You’re very good looking for your age’? I recall that was your technique...\nDALAND: I’m not used to chatting up inanimate objects... Oh, there were those two stewardesses from the planet Xegilias...\nDOCTOR: Anyway, it’s more of a shame than just a TARDIS’s feelings. We only have my TARDIS, and so we’re back to square one. (FX: Bleep) Oh, dear, we’re not just back to square one. It’s worse than\nDOCTOR: that. Do you know what that noise was earlier?\nDALAND: What?\nDOCTOR: Your heritage centre has gone on a little tour of its own, and it’s docked with this ship.\nDALAND: It’s not done that before.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s not had a large object on its doorstep before. Simple physics. This ship is large,\nDOCTOR: very close, and its own gravitational field has overridden your museum’s hyperstabilisers and dragged it towards us. That thud we heard was the automatic docking procedure coming into effect. So, hey presto, we have a whole coachload of tourists who’ve joined us and are now in as much danger as we are.\nDALAND: You do seem to know a lot about what’s going on here.\nDOCTOR: So, all I have to do is find Omega, try and calm him and lead me to his hostages, while at the same time persuading Sentia and party of elderly tourists to join us in the TARDIS under Omega’s nose. Splendid. And what do I do after breakfast, I ask myself.... What, sorry?\nDALAND: Oh, I was just saying, you seem to know an awful lot about what’s going on, considering you've just got here. You know my name, you know about Ertikus, the heritage centre, I was just wondering, that’s all...\nDOCTOR: I’ve got Omega to thank for that... When the High Council asked me to track him down I went to Earth, to where I last left him. Unfortunately he wasn’t there. Which was odd... I’ll try infra red...\nDOCTOR: Odder still was that when the Time Lords received a telepathic message, asking for help in defeating Omega in another part of the galaxy and a completely different time zone... As I was in hot pursuit, the message was routed through the thought transference switchboard and directly into my mind. And the oddest thing of all was... the message was from myself...\nDALAND: Riiiigght...\nDOCTOR: Not for the first time, of course. As a matter of fact, I’ve always considered talking to\nDOCTOR: myself to be the first sign of sanity... But of course it wasn’t me at all...\nDALAND: Oh, I get you. It was Omega...\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Ironic, really. He wasn’t aware of it, but he was asking for help to defeat himself.\nDALAND: That’s nice of him.\nDOCTOR: So putting two and two together - I guessed that Omega was sharing his body with my\nDOCTOR: mind print, and that the two psyches were taking it in turns to be dominant... Like a weather house... I wonder if that’s what it’s like?\nDALAND: Like a what?\nDALAND: DOCTOR A weather house. There’s a little plastic man with an umbrella who comes out when it’s raining, and a little plastic woman who comes out when it’s sunny, you see. And the little plastic man never sees the little plastic woman and vice versa, they’re probably not even aware that each other even exist... I always thought that was rather sad myself... What about you? Think that’s sad?\nDALAND: Thinking about little plastic men? Yes, it’s very sad.\nDOCTOR: One of our plastic figures, the Omega one, is aware he’s in the weather house, and the other one, our Doctor, doesn’t... Though I think my arrival here means he’s starting to realise... Omega\nDOCTOR: could well suffer a complete mental breakdown... And if that happens...\nDOCTOR: 58\nDOCTOR: DALAND And if that happens...?\nDOCTOR: We'll have more to worry about than the weather...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 55: EURYDICE.\nLUVIS: Omega. Omega... (Echoes and distorts into another disparaging voice, that of RAS, again this can be another member of the cast with a distorted voice) Come on, Omega! Keep up! We'll never get to the top at this rate.\nOMEGA: Why did we have to come to the top of Mount Plutarch? You know what the watchtower officer said. They’ve seen Boojums on the mountain, what happens if we come across one?\nRAS: You don’t believe those old Sisterhood stories.\nOMEGA: Frankly, Ras, I do.\nRAS: (Stops, out of breath) There you go, Omega, look!\nOMEGA: Don’t call me Omega. My name is Peylix.\nHAS: Oh, Omega, everyone calls you that, and I have no wish go against fashion. Don’t be such\nHAS: a dullard... Nicknames give you character...\nOMEGA: You don’t like people calling you Ras any more.\nRAS: Nobody except you, Omega! That’s different. It wasn’t endearing it was just a silly vulgarism. It means nothing. (Shouts) Omega represents your achievement, the only student in the history of the Academy to bear the mark of Omega... No one even knew your name before you were such a\nRAS: blimp... You should thank Cardinal Luvis...\nOMEGA: Huh!\nRAS: Come on. Look! Look at the little lights! It'll soon be ours, Omega!\nOMEGA: (Unenthusiastic) Oh... Yes... The stars... Very good. Very poetic, Ras. They’re a map of time,\nOMEGA: I suppose... shining from the past and future... Yes, one day, the past and future of all of them will be ours, I know...\nRAS: No, you idiot! Don’t look up, look down!\nOMEGA: What’s that... No... What’s happening... Those lights... That... That’s where the Academy is... The Capitol... It’s on fire... Ras, The Capitol’s on fire!\nRAS: It’s started! Revolution, Omega! The Inquisitors have started rounding everyone up, all the naysayers, doom-mongers and all I round moaning-minnies. All the Luddites who don’t believe in\nRAS: progress. Our progress... you can have all that up there, my friend, after we’ve got control of everything\nRAS: down here...\nOMEGA: No... No... We’re scientists... It shouldn’t be done with bloodshed, Ras, it’s not right...\nRAS: You are tiresome, Omega. That’s why I didn’t bother telling you, you’d have only started\nRAS: whimpering and we’d have had to have rounded you up with the others. Come on, we’re going back...\nOMEGA: Where? RAS The detention cells. Get your chance to thank Cardinal Luvis... Better hurry... He won’t\nOMEGA: be there for long... Come on... SCENE 56: TARDIS ROOM.\nDOCTOR: (FX: Bleep) Come on... Come on... I think I’ve got him! So thanks to his telepathic message,\nDOCTOR: I know pretty much everything there is I to know about the situation. A very unusual and refreshing\nDOCTOR: feeling for myself. Take a look at the scanner. (FX: Scanner) This big angry blob I here, we can guess that’s\nDOCTOR: 59\nDOCTOR: Omega... And these little angry blobs floating around his head. Now, what does that tell us?\nDALAND: Your scanner’s on the blink?\nDOCTOR: It’s like that because I’ve programmed the scanner to tune out everything but psionic energy... Now, look, there are tiny strands connecting the little blobs to the big blob. Now do you see? (A pause, then he sighs) The creatures are composed of psionic energy. Omega’s psionic energy. The Eurydice is acting like a microwave oven, reflecting and focusing it back on the host. In effect, he’s attacking himself.\nDALAND: That’s good.\nDOCTOR: What did I say about a mental breakdown? A megalomaniac schizophrenic with telepathic abilities in a high psionic I field is hardly ‘good’. Far from it.\nDALAND: If you say so.\nDOCTOR: This sector plays tricks with the mind at the best of time, but you put a Time Lord with a\nDOCTOR: mind as powerful as Omega in it... everything gets amplified. Just as those creatures are manifestations of his mind, his neuroses and subconscious feelings of guilt are leaking out of him and influencing\nDOCTOR: vulnerable minds...\nDALAND: Oh... like Tarpov?\nDOCTOR: Like Tarpov.\nDALAND: Oh, right. So these ghost things that Ertikus saw. They’re not them then, just Omega’s mind.\nDOCTOR: No, they’re not Sentillas, or whatever. Just the stuff that Omega’s dreams are made of.\nDOCTOR: Got it in one.\nDALAND: Right.\nDOCTOR: Now, where to look for these passengers first...\nDALAND: Oh, Doctor... I think your telepathic message got dropped to a puddle somewhere en\nDALAND: route. Those ‘Sentillas’... They’re actually pronounced ‘Scintillans’...\nDOCTOR: Sorry? What did you just say...?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57: EURYDICE. Dreamlike, with a hint of ‘place’ - we should be slightly aware that he 1a hallucinating the Eurydice as it was. A bustling, powerful vessel.\nVANDEKYRIANI: said I know about the Scintillans, Lord Omega...\nOMEGA: I don’t understand, Vandekyrian...\nVANDEKYRIAN: Don’t play games with me. You know there’s an indigenous species on the third asteroid orbiting Jartus Twelve. Omega... I’ve seen them! Creatures of pure thought floating in the corridor as\nVANDEKYRIAN: large as you like... They came here to tell us of their existence.\nOMEGA: You don’t know what you’re saying. We have searched thoroughly... There is no life there.\nVANDEKYRIAN: There is. I’ve seen it!\nOMEGA: But the misenscopes! Look at them! There is nothing! Nothing!\nVANDEKYRIAN: But we can’t risk it! We have to find another star...\nOMEGA: Do you know what you're saying? That will take hundreds, perhaps thousands of years before we find another...\nOMEGA: VANDEKYRIANYou’re contemplating genocide because you're worried about time? When we find another star, every moment of time in the universe will be ours for the taking...\nOMEGA: But not by me! Do you think, after all the shame, the scorn that I have endured, that I will\nOMEGA: simply lie down and leave it to some upstart to take the glory of my research? I am not a warrior\nOMEGA: 60\nOMEGA: Vandekyrian, I am not a martyr, a tyrant or a hero... I am a scientist, I don’t even have my own name, anymore...\nVANDEKYRIAN: You're mad.\nOMEGA: (Pleading) I’m hanging on to history with my fingernails, Vandekyrian. How others perceive me is all I have left...\nVANDEKYRIAN: Omega... You don’t know what you’re saying... Wake up and listen to yourself. Wake up!\nVANDEKYRIAN: The action shifts into reality.\nSENTIA: Omega... ! Wake up!\nOMEGA: Omega... Iam (DOCTOR voice) not Omega... I am the Doctor...\nSENTIA: Oh, no... You said this knowledge would cause you some trauma... You are not the\nSENTIA: Doctor, you are Omega! You are Omega.\nOMEGA: I (DOCTOR) talked to Omega... in a dream...\nSENTIA: That’s right... But you were talking to yourself... You had to convince the Doctor part of you to help us...\nOMEGA: Sentia, my dear... You must never know what I did... killed them... Because I had to... You must never know of it... You must not (DOCTOR) discover what I did...\nOMEGA: SENTIA To the Scintillans? But I do know, my darling. Tarpov told me before he died. He told me about the Scintillans...\nOMEGA: (DOCTOR/ OMEGA) You know...?\nSENTIA: Yes... There was no need... it doesn’t change us...\nOMEGA: You know... about the Scintillans?\nSENTIA: It doesn’t change what I feel for you, what we have together... It doesn’t matter... You\nSENTIA: don’t have to...\nOMEGA: (OMEGA. He is shrieking now) It doesn’t matter? I committed genocide and it doesn’t matter to you? You babble of regrets, you mewl and whine why insignificant individuals had to die...\nEX: Crash as OMEGA blunders around in a violent rage.\nSENTIA: Omega...\nOMEGA: ...yet an entire species is condemned by my hand and you shrug it off like confetti. What kind of creature are you?\nSENTIA: Omega, stop it!\nOMEGA: You are a monster!!! A fiend from hell itself!!!\nSENTIA: (Choking) No, Omega, no!\nSENTIA: SCENE 58: EURYDICE.\nDOCTOR: (Sniffs) It seems fine...\nDALAND: (Off mic, within TARDIS) Can I come out yet?\nDOCTOR: Wait a second — just doing a few tests...\nDALAND: (In TARDIS) Why are you waving that thing about?\nDOCTOR: Waving celery about in the air is a useful method for testing for dimensional instability.\nDALAND: (In TARDIS) How does that check for dimensional instability?\nDOCTOR: Well if it changes into pineapple, I now we are in trouble. (Pause) It’s safe, you can come out of the\nTARDIS: now.\nDALAND: I hope Sentia ’s all right.\nDOCTOR: We'll go and find out shall we. Coming?\nDOCTOR: 61\nDALAND: No, Il stay here. In case we need to make a quick getaway.\nDOCTOR: You'd better take the remote activator, then. Don’t want it falling into certain person’s hands... and\nDOCTOR: don’t press any buttons. Take it from me, Daland. Finding yourself in the wrong universe is not a pleasant\nDOCTOR: experience.\nDALAND: There’s something loose in this, rattling around.\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear, that’s not a good sign. Is it damaged?\nDALAND: Hang on... ITl just open it (FX: Case opened) Oh... eww...\nDOCTOR: Let me see... Oh, dear... That’s a bit grim, isn’t it?\nDALAND: Well, that’s one mystery solved... We know what happened to Tarpov’s other hand...\nDALAND: SCENE 59: EURYDICE. OMEGA’S THOUGHTS...\nOMEGA: You found him?\nTIME: LORD Yes, Lord Omega...\nOMEGA: Where was he?\nTIME: LORD ein the engine room, my Lord. He... he was trying to destroy his hands...\nTIME: OMEGA And did he succeed...?\nTIME: LORD He placed one in the fusion chamber, but he lost consciousness before he could destroy the other.\nOMEGA: Bring him in...\nVANDEKYRIAN: (Weakly) Omega... No... Please don’t... Think of what you’re doing...\nOMEGA: I have done, my friend. Vandekyrian, there are no life signs out there. We must continue.\nTIME: LORD He won’t unclench his hand, Lord Omega.\nOMEGA: I’m sorry, Vandekyrian... But you know the security protocols... (FX: Whirr like a dentist’s drill) We need the handprint of everyone here present to activate the symbiotic link...\nVANDEKYRIAN: (Screams)\nOMEGA: Put... this...on the panel... Activate.\nVANDEKYRIAN: You... monster...\nOMEGA: If I have to be a monster to bring our race into a new age of enlightenment... Then so be it... I will be a monster...\nOMEGA: SCENE 60: HERITAGE CENTRE. AIRLOCK.\nDOCTOR: Are here we are... They should be near the tea shop, if I know my tourists....\nSENTIA: (Off mic) Welcome to the Omega Heritage Centre giftshop, sir...\nDOCTOR: Sentia? Is that you?\nSENTIA: (Off mic) ... we hope you can avail yourself of our impressive selection of official Omega\nSENTIA: merchandise, Omegan happy hats, Black Star paperweights, Hand of Omega ashtrays. The children will love our humorous T-shirts, emblazoned with our copyrighted Omega Heritage Centre logo on the chest, and with a variety of messages, including thin one, ‘I spent millennia in a world of... (falters) anti-matter\nSENTIA: and all I got... got... was this lousy - uuh!\nSENTIA: 62\nDOCTOR: Are you all right? You’re hurt...\nSENTIA: (Distant) Aww... you’re helping me up. You’re so sweet. You're just like him, you know... He was so vulnerable...\nDOCTOR: I’m sure he was.\nSENTIA: When I look at you, Doctor, it’s almost as if he was here, the same lonely face, the sad blue eyes... The soft gentle hands... The way he touched my face... The way he caressed-\nDOCTOR: (Breaking in, embarrassed) Indeed.\nSENTIA: He’s just confused, you know. Just like when I met him on Algonal. He was lost, bewildered, he barely knew who he was. (Giggles) Didn’t know if he was a rat, or a bat, or a cat. I went over and asked if I could help him... And he remembered... I helped him remember... He told me that he... he was Omega... He’d come all the way from, where was it...?\nDOCTOR: Sentia, I can’t find the passengers. Do you know whereabouts the other passengers of the\nDOCTOR: tour shuttle...?\nSENTIA: Oh, I put them somewhere... Can’t remembert...\nDOCTOR: You must concentrate. Where?\nSENTIA: Oh! I remember.\nDOCTOR: Where?\nSENTIA: Amsterdam. He wandered into Ertikus’s TARDIS in Amsterdam, and the next thing poor\nSENTIA: little Omega knew, he was on Algonal... We found out that Ertikus was going to travel to the sector of forgotten souls and try and find the Eurydice. Ertikus was so excited, he was going to find Omega. (Slyly, lazily) but I found him first...\nDOCTOR: Sentia - please concentrate. Where are the passengers...?\nSENTIA: That’s when we planned to go through to his universe together. He would be whole again,\nSENTIA: and we would be so... so... happy.\nDOCTOR: Sentia...! Erm... Stewardess... could you point me to the rest of my party? I seem to be lost.\nSENTIA: (Snapping back into stewardess mode) Certainly sir, they’re just locked behind that door in\nSENTIA: the Prydonian’s Pantry. Wait a moment, I'll just open it for you... (FX: unwelcome bleep). Oh, dear... I’m sorry, sir. It doesn’t seem to be operating correctly. If you'll just wait a moment, sir, I'll just apply my door\nSENTIA: decoder. It should open in just a few minutes...\nOMEGA: (Off mic, calling) Sentia... Sentia...\nSENTIA: I’m in here......\nDOCTOR: Shhh!\nOMEGA: (Off mic) Sentia... where are you? It is 1, Omega... I just want to apologise to you...\nSENTIA: Why are-\nDOCTOR: Shhh!\nSENTIA: (Gently) There’s no cause for alarm, sir... The man out there in the corridor is just one of\nSENTIA: our actors hired to give our centre an authentic historical flavour...\nDOCTOR: I don’t think he’d be very pleased to hear you say that...\nSENTIA: Could I interest you in a souvenir of your stay. How about our Talking Omega? Says four\nSENTIA: simple phrases.\nDOCTOR: That many? Sounds like the Omega I used to know. Not today, thank you...\nSENTIA: It’s very well made. All you have to do to activate it...\nDOCTOR: Sentia, I really wouldn't...\nDOCTOR: 63\nSENTIA: ... is to pick it up. Like so...\nOMEGA: (Too loud, tinny and squeaky) 1, Omega, will have my revenge!\nOMEGA: Doctor!!!\nOMEGA: I, Omega, will have my revenge!’, Welcome to my world of anti-matter!’, Twas betrayed by my brother Time Lords!’ and ‘Release the Hand of Omega’.\nOMEGA: Doctor, so there you are, cowering in the dirt like your Time Lord brothers!\nDOCTOR: Omega, I need to talk to you. It’s quite important.\nOMEGA: Betrayer! Betray me, like Rassilon, like Vandekyrian!\nDOCTOR: Vandekyrian didn’t do anything! Listen to me!\nOMEGA: (As DOCTOR) Doctor, we must join our minds! We must be one! (DOCTOR) You must help\nOMEGA: me! (OMEGA) Help me! (DOCTOR) Help me! (OMEGA) You betrayed me, Doctor (DOCTOR) You betrayed me!\nOMEGA: What is happening?\nSENTIA: Excuse me, sir, if you can step to one side we can let the passengers out of the Prydonian pantry.\nOLDIES: (All saying ‘Omega’, ‘It is Omega’, ragged, disconnected)}!\nOMEGA: What is this?\nOLDIES: (Saying various phrases such as) You must stop this folly! You must mend your murderous\nOLDIES: ways! Desist from your murderous folly! Murderous guiltless beast! Desist from your dark and shadowy\nOLDIES: path! I will stop you! (Ending with a chorus of) lam Vandekyrian Conscience of the universe!\nOMEGA: No! Get away! Get away from me! Leave me alone!\nDOCTOR: They can really bash those crutches around, can’t they? That handbag fetched him quite a nasty wallop. I don’t think it was just; knitting in there...\nSENTIA: My passengers appear distressed. Perhaps they need refreshment...\nDOCTOR: They’ve been affected by this sector of space... I can only hope it’s not permanent...\nDOCTOR: Sentia... Stewardess... Can you hear me... We’re going to evacuate your passengers... I think there is a way to get them off this ship... Unfortunately... Go back to the TARDIS and tell Daland what I’m about to\nDOCTOR: do and tell him to get ready to operate the doors when I shout...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 61: HERITAGE CENTRE.\nDOCTOR: shroud us all’.\nDOCTOR: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see, I am Omega.\nDOCTOR: I’m just about to perform my dark and heinous act, and stain my hands with the blood of\nDOCTOR: innocents. You could stop me, of course, but then again you'll have to catch me first...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 62: TARDIS.\nDALAND: Here he comes... being chased by fifty old ladies screaming their heads off. Who’d be famous, eh?\nDOCTOR: (Off mic, yelling as he runs) Get behind the doors! Get behind the doors!\nDOCTOR: 64\nDOCTOR: Old biddies screaming into TARDIS, past them and into the rest of the ship.\nDOCTOR: (Out of breath) Get the internal doors shut! Get them shut! (FX: Slam Lock) Activate the palm lock - there... that should hold them...\nDALAND: Good idea of yours, pretending to be Omega, but next time, get a few tips from someone\nDALAND: who’s perfected his performance...\nDOCTOR: (Acidly) Thanks for the advice. How’s Sentia?\nDALAND: Weird. Distant. Like nothing’s happening...\nDOCTOR: Sentia, can you hear me...?\nDOCTOR: SENTIA Of course I can, Omega, you're right. I shouldn’t have doubted you. It was a terrible thing\nDOCTOR: you did, killing all those creatures. I can see that now... I can see it... A terrible thing...\nDOCTOR: Sentia!\nDALAND: Doctor, on the scanner! We’ve got company. Your twin’s outside and I think he wants a family\nDALAND: reunion.\nDOCTOR: Right, I7l go and speak to him.\nDALAND: What?\nSENTIA: (In an odd voice, with a strange intensity) I want to come with you. I want to see Omega.\nDOCTOR: No, Sentia, I don’t think that’s a good idea. It’s something I have to do alone...\nDOCTOR: Daland, watch me on the scanner. If anything happens to me, just press this button and the TARDIS will take you off the ship.\nDALAND: This is about the Scintillans, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it’s about the Scintillans.\nDALAND: What about them?\nDOCTOR: Daland, even when you have the whole of time and space to lose yourself in, sometimes\nDOCTOR: the past has a habit of catching up with you. I have to talk to him. I still owe him that much.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 63: EURYDICE. OUTSIDE TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Omega...\nOMEGA: Doctor, I have a terrible guilt. It burns like a lighted candle in the dark. When I shut my eyes it still makes a mark on my eyelids. (DOCTOR) But I am strong. The end justifies the means. It has to. Why then do I feel such pain?\nDOCTOR: You shouldn’t be guilty, Omega. You really shouldn’t. You’re a victim of circumstance.\nDOCTOR: You've always been a victim of circumstance...\nOMEGA: Spare me your twittering conscience platitudes. (DOCTOR) All my life I have listened to spineless (OMEGA) insects like you and Vandekyrian.\nDOCTOR: Vandekyrian didn’t do anything! You have to listen to me!\nOMEGA: No, he didn’t do anything... I did. I killed them all.\nOMEGA: SCENE 64: EURYDICE.\nTIME: LORD ' My Lord, the engines have failed. We’re trapped in the gravitational field of the black hole.\nTIME: 65\nOMEGA: Then restart the engines, you fool!\nTIME: LORD _esiIt’s impossible, Lord. There are impurities in the fusion mix. The engines are completely dead!\nOMEGA: Impurities in the fusion mix! Well, well, well, Vandekyrian... You had a hand in my downfall after all...\nOMEGA: SCENE 65: EURYDICE.\nOMEGA: I killed them all... I deserved my exile, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Because of the Scintillans? Because of how you murdered them in the name of scientific progress? How you murdered Vandekyrian I when he tried to stop you... It’s a very sad and tragic story. If it were true.\nOMEGA: What are you saying?\nDOCTOR: You made it up. You didn’t kill the Scintillans. You’ve created a fiction, a story in your\nDOCTOR: mind to explain away what Vandekyrian did to you...\nOMEGA: I don’t... understand...\nDOCTOR: You didn’t kill the Scintillans. It was me. I killed them!\nOMEGA: You? Your You're lying...\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. There was a Lurman colony just outside the Stegoran asteroid belt. I arrived\nDOCTOR: there whilst they were being attacked by a band of Deradrenim Pirates. The Lurmans asked me to help\nDOCTOR: them.\nOMEGA: Lies!\nDOCTOR: (Charges on, almost gabbling) The Deradrenim control their ships and weaponry using a form\nDOCTOR: of telepathy, so I made a dampening forcefield to stop their equipment functioning... Unfortunately what I didn’t know was that the asteroid belt was also home to the Scintillans... They were beings of pure\nDOCTOR: thought, Omega...\nOMEGA: Youre just telling me a story...\nDOCTOR: No...\nOMEGA: ...telling me a story designed to make me feel better...-\nDOCTOR: No... I wish I wasn’t...\nOMEGA: (Laughs himself hysterical, then collapses in a fit of hoarse giggles)\nDOCTOR: (Almost annoyed at being laughed at) I made a terrible mistake. They were completely destroyed.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 66: TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: (On scanner) You must have taken my memories and made them your own, woven it into a story of what happened on Eurydice all that time ago...\nDALAND: So, it was the Doctor... He did it all along. Poor old Omega was completely blameless. Eh, Sentia, perhaps he is a hero after all. Sentia? Sentia? Where’s she gone? Oh, no, I didn’t shut the door. Oh, God... The remote activator. Where is it?\nDALAND: SCENE 67: EURYDICE.\nOMEGA: (Finally able to speak through the giggles) Yes, I must have done... So what really happened to\nOMEGA: 66\nOMEGA: me, Doctor? What happened to us all those centuries ago! Please tell me! You have me in suspense!\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what happened. Maybe you were betrayed by Rassilon, maybe Vandekyrian was out to sabotage the ship. I don’t know! Probably the most likely explanation is Vandekyrian just went\nDOCTOR: mad and imagined it all, like everyone else seems to when they enter this part of space.\nOMEGA: Why would I construct such a fiction for myself? Why would I want to believe I committed genocide?\nDOCTOR: You tell me... Perhaps you wanted to. Perhaps you can’t bear to think your exile was a\nDOCTOR: result of a stupid mistake, a result of one man’s delusions.\nOMEGA: (Starts chuckling again) Yes, you’re right, Doctor. Perhaps I prefer myself as a monster. Better to shape history like a statue than j to be crushed by the ebonite. Better to shape the universe than\nOMEGA: to be one y of history’s victims. But then, tell me, Doctor... why do I feel tom apart by the guilt that you should be feeling?\nDOCTOR: But I do! Of course, I feel it very deeply. Their deaths will\nDOCTOR: Stay with me forever!\nOMEGA: Oh, not like this... Not like this... You should be on your knees screaming for the universe to forgive you. I must have spent too long from the harsh realities of this life’s existence... For all my reputation as a warlord, a tyrant, a megalomaniac... I am a fragile flower compared to you... Who is the monster here, Doctor? Tell me that!\nSENTIA: (On Tannoy. In manner of commentary in Part One, but more brittle and strained) Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you’ve enjoyed j our little interactive presentation, I hope you’ve learned a little bit\nSENTIA: about Omega and his world. I know I certainly have.\nOMEGA: Sentia...?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nSENTIA: ...And I’d like to inform our passengers that we will shortly be reaching the climax of the\nSENTIA: tour... We’re going to go through a dimensional rift which was the actual place where Omega was trapped for all those thousands of years... (Weakly) ‘Oooh...’ Crossing the event horizon and entering a completely different universe... Just in the same way Omega did in his quest to travel in time...\nOMEGA: Sentia, is that you...?\nSENTIA: ...Of course, we don’t like going into history, we much prefer Jolly Chronolidays to bring history to us, don’t we?\nOMEGA: Sentia! No!!!\nOMEGA: SCENE 68: TARDIS.\nDALAND: Doctor, it’s Sentia.\nDOCTOR: I know it is. The engines have been activated. We’re going in... So we make a choice. We\nDOCTOR: stay, and jeopardise thirty lives, or stay and destroy three.\nDALAND: Oh. Not much of a choice, is it?\nDOCTOR: These are choices I have to make all the time. Sometimes I make the right one, sometimes...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 69: SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nDOCTOR: 67\nOMEGA: (Out of breath) Sentia... (DOCTOR You're taking us into the event horizon... (OMEGA/ DOCTOR) What are you doing, Sentia?\nSENTIA: Sentia? Who is Sentia? I am not Sentia...\nOMEGA: But you...are...\nSENTIA: (Snarls) Iam Vandekyrian! Conscience of the universe!!!\nSENTIA: SCENE 70: TARDIS.\nDALAND: This is the switch, right?\nDOCTOR: Daland.\nDALAND: Come off it, Doctor, we’re not going to survive through there. None of us will.\nDOCTOR: Fine. Il do it.\nDALAND: No, Doctor. I'll do it. Let someone else take some responsibility for a change. Lord knows\nDALAND: it’s about time I did.\nDALAND: SCENE 71: SHUTTLE. COCKPIT.\nSENTIA: Goodbye Omegaaaaa! (Screams, her distorting and echoing round OMEGA)\nOMEGA: Sentia, no. Nol!!! Nol!!! No!!! Nol!!! (His ‘No’ gets angrier more anguished, more echoey, until it is indistinguishable from a loud roar)\nOMEGA: SCENE 78: TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nDALAND: (Hushed) Well?\nDOCTOR: All gone. Eurydice. Heritage Centre. Tour shuttle... Omega... He’s gone.\nDALAND: Is he dead?\nDOCTOR: (Hushed) Omega doesn’t die easily... And the tragedy is, he doesn’t live easily either...\nDALAND: Do you think his plan worked?\nDOCTOR: If it did, he’s on his own again. If it didn’t, hel be with me for all eternity. I’m not sure\nDOCTOR: which fate I’d wish on him.\nDALAND: This is terrible... ’m out of a job now. (Beat) Sorry. Told you I was shallow...\nGLINDA: (Voice slowly resolving out of TARDIS sound) Well, this isn’t very good, is it? You call this a time machine? Where’s the nice oak panelling and the brass fittings, that’s how a proper time machine should look. This doesn’t look anywhere near as impressive as the Chronopodules made by the temporal monks in the catacombs of Sensoterrian Major... And they’re rubbishhhhhhhhhh.\nMAVEN: (Exiting GLINDA) I’m sorry about that. She’s very efficient, but her personality isn’t always the most agreeable... I suppose your old machine leads you quite a merry dance as well, eh, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We have our moments. What are you doing here?\nMAVEN: I’m from the Celestial Preservation Agency, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Never heard of you.\nDOCTOR: 68\nMAVEN: Hardly surprising, Doctor, we’re from your future. As our name implies it’s our job to make sure the pattern of history remains intact.\nDOCTOR: How very commendable, but I don’t see anything here that affects recorded history. And isn’t it forbidden for Time Lords to dip into their own history?\nMAVEN: We also look after the perception of recorded history, Doctor. Sometimes it’s as important as history itself. We look on the past very differently now. We like to keep it... under control.\nDOCTOR: Really? How very uninteresting.\nDALAND: Sorry, you’re a Time Lord? And that old dear’s a TARDIS... So all that deaf-as-a-post stuff...\nMAVEN: Yes, it was all pretend. And yes, Mr. Daland, I did hear you mutter the words ‘crumbling antique’, ‘scrofulous harridan’ and ‘cloth-eared fossil’. You’re very lucky I wasn’t a genuine passenger...\nDOCTOR: Much as I enjoy chit-chatting here with you, can I ask what you’re doing here? Apart from getting in the way, of course.\nMAVEN: My mission is to make sure a certain hero’s reputation remained intact.\nDOCTOR: Well I’m glad you lot have found something useful to do for a change. You realise that\nDOCTOR: nothing was Omega’s fault here. He was completely blameless.\nGLINDA: Oh, you silly man. We’re not here about Omega, he’s a complete joke in our time. We’re here about you.\nDOCTOR: Me?\nMAVEN: You're a great hero now. Your name will be a rallying cry for our people during dark times in your future. We can’t have it bandied around that you committed genocide by accident. And that incident subsequently caused another Time Lord to go insane with your guilt and go on a murderous rampage. Think of the scandal! So we came here to make sure that this unpleasant episode doesn’t\nMAVEN: besmirch your reputation.\nMAVEN: DOCTOR And how would it do that?\nMAVEN: Through the only survivor, of course. Mr. Daland here.\nDALAND: Me?\nMAVEN: He’s the only person who knows what you did, because, you didn’t tell the Lurmans did\nMAVEN: you? (Tuts) Our enemies could pluck him out of time, interrogate him, and make you look a right nasty piece of work, and that would never do. We have tried to mindwipe him, but it doesn’t seem to work.\nMAVEN: Probably a thick skull as well as a thick skin.\nDOCTOR: Well, that would account for him not being sent mad by this area of space.\nMAVEN: So we’re going to take him with us.\nDALAND: Hey, wait a minute! No, no, no! You’ve got a life to lead, I’ve got -\nMAVEN: Nothing, Mr. Daland. Just a tiny habiflat and an unwashed duvet.\nDALAND: Oh, yeah...\nMAVEN: Let me tell you what we are offering. You see, we have interactive museums, too. In fact,\nMAVEN: there’s one right in the centre of the Capitol devoted entirely to the heroic exploits of the Doctor here. We\nMAVEN: need someone like you to... to communicate those deeds in the first person...\nDALAND: You mean, I could play the Doctor? Marvellous! I can do that! (Declamatory) Hold! I am the great Doctor! Champion of Time! Defeater of the dreaded Omega! Can I wear a cloak?\nDOCTOR: Could I ask something of you?\nMAVEN: Anything for you, Doctor. It’s not often you get to work on a project with one of your heroes...\nDOCTOR: I’m just curious... This museum of yours... of me... How do you present this story of me?\nDOCTOR: 69\nMAVEN: Just the same, really, a few tweaks here and there. Names changed to protect the innocent. Would you like to hear it?\nDOCTOR: No! Well... Yes, I suppose... Yes. When you’re hanging onto existence by your\nDOCTOR: fingernails... The stories about your exploits are all you have left...\nMAVEN: All right. If you’re interested, I’ll tell you the story, and this is only because you asked, and only because it’s you. It’s the story of a very powerful and foolish Time Lord, who did a terrible thing, and of the heroic Time Lord, who discovered what he did, to his great horror. With me so far? Oh, before we start, could you do something for me? Just a little thing... I don’t suppose, Doctor... Could I have your\nMAVEN: autograph?\nMAVEN: THE END\nMAVEN: 70\nOMEGA: By Nev Fountain Email: Gary Russell to Nev Fountain — Wednesday 8 May 2002\nOMEGA: Nev,\nOMEGA: I'm looking for a proposal for a Fifth Doctor companion-less adventure, that can find a convincing and original way to do something with Omega (post-Arc of Infinity version). This should be quite a good two-hander (plus supporting characters), but I want it to focus on the fact that the Doctor is instinctively biased against Omega and has a hard time reconciling his feelings with this guy who he, deep down, really rather admires and even worships. A whole we-shouldn’'t-meet-our-heroes-cos-they ve-feet-of- clay approach.\nOMEGA: I know this may seem to be flogging a dead, anti-mattered horse, but I think there's life in the concept yet. I thought you might enjoy the challenge of this because it needs to be a character-based rather than an action-based adventure, but with a smidgen of continuity. Of course there needs to be a good strong Who story at the back of it all, but don't over-complicate it.This is the main thrust.\nOMEGA: Oh, and the story is just to be called Omega.\nOMEGA: Gary\nOUTLINE: PART ONE\nOUTLINE: Two people are waiting.\nOUTLINE: ‘They are coming, Lord Omega:\nOUTLINE: ‘Poor fools. They know nothing of Omega yet. We shall give them a demonstration of his power they will never forget.\nOUTLINE: A tour shuttle is travelling through an infamous sector of space. On it, Sentia, a tour guide, is talking over the intercom to the various holidaying species, reciting her carefully prepared script in a chirpy sing-song voice honed by endless repetition.\nOUTLINE: ‘... and if you look out of the window, you can see a smail cluster of stars... Omega himself could very well have looked out of a window, a window very like the one you're looking out of, and looked at those very stars, or a collection of stars very like it, as he was thinking about the historic thing he was about to do... That’s the end of this part of the tour, ll be returning to you in fifteen minutes when we arrive at the Sector of Forgotten Souls...’\nOUTLINE: Sentia goes for a coffee on the bridge. Captain Daland, who thinks himself rather suave, but is on the wrong side of slimy, notes with amusement that Sentia is yawning. ‘New boyfriend keeping you up nights?\"\nOUTLINE: ‘Longer than you ever did’\nOUTLINE: Daland says it was a bad idea that Sentia broke off theic engagement. She could have been his ‘little woman back on Algol’. Sentia snaps back she could have been, if she hadn’t discovered he'd already got a little woman back on Proxima, and two little women back on Arcturus...\nOUTLINE: In the passenger area, it's very apparent that it’s an intergalactic Saga holiday. Two old\nOUTLINE: 373\nOUTLINE: biddies, Glinda and Maven, are boring another passenger to death with stories of all the planets they've visited. It doesn’t help matters that Maven is profoundly deaf, and Glinda repeats everything she says in a loud register for Maven’s benefit.\nOUTLINE: The other passenger, who calls himself the Doctor, is sounding quite dejected, but humouring them manfully.\nOUTLINE: Glinda is puzzled. ‘You're a bit young to go on one of these things, aren't you?’\nOUTLINE: ‘Well, I am pushing 900.\nOUTLINE: ‘Well, even so... still on the young side all the same.\nOUTLINE: Maven is also puzzled, because she didn't see the Doctor get on at the start of the tour. The Doctor says he’s been keeping a low profile. Maven takes it as an admission of space sickness, which doesn't help to endear her to the Doctor.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor’s not sure why he's on the tour. He puts it down to a dream, in which he’s standing on an old sailing ship. A solitary figure is on the deck with him.‘The figure turned to me, and said something in a sepulchral whisper...’\nOUTLINE: ‘And what did the figure tell you?’ Glinda asks, awed.\nOUTLINE: ‘Funnily enough, he told me I needed a holiday.\nOUTLINE: ‘A holiday!’\nOUTLINE: ‘Yes, mind you, having dreams like that, I probably don’t need to be told, do I?’\nOUTLINE: Sentia continues to tell the passengers about Omega’s famous mission, about his detonation of the star of Kasterill to provide the Time Lords the power of time travel, and how his ship was caught in the resulting black hole, lost with all hands, and caught in the gap between universes.\nOUTLINE: She also tells them of the stories and superstitions that, once in a millennia, the ghost of Omega’s ship appears in this very sector of space, in order to lure unwary spacefarers to their doom.\nOUTLINE: She is interrupted in mid sentence - with an unearthly shrieking sound, a huge ghostly ship appears in front of the tour shuttle...\nOUTLINE: Sentia apologises for the theatrics - it’s just a mock-up. It’s a heritage centre disguised as a life-size reproduction of Omega’s ship with an interactive museum on board.\nOUTLINE: They dock, the geriatric tourists enter and Sentia informs them that,‘When this bell sounds, everyone must return to this point and assemble for embarkation.\nOUTLINE: She is interrupted by the cwo figures (from the opening scene with ‘Omega’'). They turn out to be two actors re-enacting the roles of Omega and his first technician Vandekan - there is a not-very-humorous and over-scripted exchange with Sentia, and once she leaves they re-enact the famous scene: the detonation of the star.\nOUTLINE: At the end of the re-inaction, ‘Vandekan' reveals himself to be an agent of Rassilon. ‘Vandekan’ declaims that Rassilon can never allow Omega back to Gallifrey once his heroism captures the imagination of the people, and betrays ‘Omega’, sending the whole ship into the black hole.\nOUTLINE: Sentia is in the empty shuttle, putting away the rubbish and is accosted by the Doctor. He asks if she believes the rumours of Omega’s cruelty.\nOUTLINE: ‘lm sure it’s not true, she says. ‘Omega was a hero. I’m sure heroes don’t let things like that happen:\nOUTLINE: ‘Nicely put:\nOUTLINE: ‘I'm sure you have more in common with Omega than you know, Doctor:\nOUTLINE: “Well, that is certainly true’\nOUTLINE: He still looks puzzled. Sentia offers to fill him in on more of the legend if he wants.The Doctor shakes his head. The reason he’s puzzled is because he already knows the legend back to front, and is just at a loss as to why he’s chosen to come on such a tacky holiday.\nOUTLINE: 374\nOUTLINE: Offended, Sentia icily plants a guidebook in his hand, and suggests he join the rest of the group on the Omega Heritage ship. He flicks through it, reading about Omega’s young life, and his desire to explore the universe and make a difference. The Doctor Starts to remember why he used to admire Omega.\nOUTLINE: ‘That guidebook's all complete rubbish, of course:\nOUTLINE: Doctor is joined by Professor Corrigan, a reticed Temporal Archaeologist from Gallifrey. He evinces his theory that the whole story of Omega is romantic nonsense, and has taken the tour to this sector of space to see what he can find out.\nOUTLINE: The two actors, Shezion and Tarpov, are relaxing after the ‘performance’ in the green room, giving each other a luvvieish back-slap. Tarpovy compliments Shezion on his resonant Omega, and Shezion repays it, complimenting Tarpov’s idea of ‘workshopping’ before each performance.\nOUTLINE: Sentia enters with the rubbish from the cruiser, apologising for the interruption - it would make things a lot easier if they had a garbage dispenser on the ship, and blames the penny-pinching of the company.\nOUTLINE: Once she departs, Shezion starts acting strangely. Tarpov gets nervous, but tries to humour him. Shezion is enraged at this, calls him a traitor, and calls him Vandekan. Shezion attacks Tarpov, who runs out of the room screaming.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor and Professor Corrigan enter the ship, and come across Glinda and Maven again, who have collared Captain Daland and are complimenting him on the wonderful actors in the performance piece.‘They have a wonderful knack of bringing the whole thing to life’\nOUTLINE: There is a bloodcurdling scream. Daland says, ‘Oh, no, not again!’ He runs to the dressing room and the Professor and the Doctor accompany him,\nOUTLINE: When they get back to the green room, Sentia is alceady trying to staunch the bleeding of an unconscious Tarpov, who is minus a hand. Shezion is under a table, clutching the severed limb, giggling to himself.They try to get the hand from Shezion but he runs away into the ship.\nOUTLINE: They do their best for Tarpov, but the medical facilities are rudimentary. Sentia says it isn’t really odd at all. She concludes that Shezion has done a few too many seasons at the Omega Heritage centre - those that do have a habit of going insane, due to the build-up of psionic energy in this sector of space.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is scandalised by this casual attitude to human life - that madness and death are the price some people have to pay for a cheap holiday. Sentia shrugs - they knew the risks. The Doctor is concerned. Something very strange is happening here.\nOUTLINE: ‘And there’s a nasty thought, too. What if Tarpov starts to believe he’s Vandekan?' They are interrupted by a familiar sound. The garbage grinder. They find Tarpov has put his other hand in it.The Doctor quotes ruefully from his souvenir book:'... And Vandekan, so remorseful was he at the hand he held against Omega, that he took his remaining one from his body...’\nOUTLINE: They stabilise Tarpov, who is babbling about ‘They're all gone...Tried to stop him... Omega... The Scintillans... Killed them all...’\nOUTLINE: Professor Corrigan is intrigued. Tarpov’s babbling looks as though he knows something about what really happened all those millennia ago.\nOUTLINE: Sentia tells the situation to Daland over the intercom, but he cares as little as Sentia did. He's seen it all before; besides, the flight computer alerted him to some unusual readings, so he had to go to the shuttle’s flight deck. Something very strange is happening outside the ship.\nOUTLINE: With an unearthly shimmering - Omega’s rea/ ship turns up.\nOUTLINE: 375\nOUTLINE: The Doctor, Professor Corrigan and Sentia return to the TARDIS where the Doctor makes some checks on the console. The ship is phasing in and out of the real universe. It seems the stories about it being caught between the realities are true.\nOUTLINE: The Professor is in awe of the ship, and would love to explore it. He goes to take his own readings, leaving Sentia and the Doctor alone.\nOUTLINE: ‘By the way, says the Doctor casually, I'm called the Doctor...\nOUTLINE: ‘T know that, says Sentia.\nOUTLINE: ‘Which is odd that you do. because I'm not on your manifest. and I've not introduced myself’\nOUTLINE: She pulls a gun on him.\nOUTLINE: ‘Now that is odd. Does a blaster come under the guidelines of ‘care and comfort of passengers’ ?\"\nOUTLINE: ‘You need to see Omega, Doctor\nOUTLINE: ‘As I say, I didn’t pay for the tour, and I've no real enthusiasm for historical re- enactments:\nOUTLINE: ‘Well, put it another way. Omega wants to see you.\nOUTLINE: ‘Oh, really? Difficult that, 1 was under the impression he was dead’\nOUTLINE: ‘Then let me help you join him:\nOUTLINE: She fires the blaster.\nOUTLINE: PART TWO\nOUTLINE: The Doctor awakens on the sailing ship in his dream.The figure is there again, watching him. It is Omega.\nOUTLINE: ‘I take it this isn’t heaven - and you are not God. Though you would dearly love to believe you are:\nOUTLINE: ‘I am sorry Sentia had to stun you, Doctor. In my present state I can only manifest myself in the subconscious mind’\nOUTLINE: ‘So, ’'ve been hijacked; says the Doctor ruefully. ‘Don’t tell me, I’ve guessed. You “hitched a ride” in the TARDIS telepathic circuit:\nOUTLINE: ‘Your time machine has such strange emotions towards you, it was fascinating’\nOUTLINE: ‘And once you were in the telepathic circuits it was child's play to give me a mental nudge into taking this holiday - ] knew I had better taste than this.\nOUTLINE: ‘I had to bring you to this sector of space, Doctor - I need your help:\nOUTLINE: ‘Oh, yes, I go around hetping megalomaniacs atl the time:\nOUTLINE: ‘Not so. Omega explains that after his body was destroyed by the Doctor on Amsterdam, his mind was thrown back into the Matrix. He claims his mind, having been reduced to nothing more than electronic impulses, was cleansed of his madness.\nOUTLINE: ‘Tam now as my brother Time Lords knew me before, Doctor. No monster, no tyrant... just the greatest scientist of our people’\nOUTLINE: ‘And the most modest, obviously. So what does the new, improved Omega want?’\nOUTLINE: Omega tells the Doctor he wants to return to his kingdom of anti-matter. There is nothing left for him in this universe, and he wants to go to his old ship and push it out of its limbo, and pilot it into his own universe.\nOUTLINE: He needs the Doctor, because to fix the ship he needs a Time Lord - only a Time Lord can survive in such dimensional instability... And the only way they can reach the ship in this unstable sector of space is via a TARDIS.\nOUTLINE: The arrival of Omega's real ship has passed largely unnoticed back on the Heritage Centre, with the tourists assuming it’s just another part of the interactive tour. ‘Not another one, says Glinda.‘My feet are killing me’\nOUTLINE: 376\nOUTLINE: The Doctor agrees to Omega's plan. partly because he decides that Omega has to be sincere, partly because he is intrigued at what lies in Omega’'s ship.\nOUTLINE: ‘Tell me - how did you enlist Sentia. being in your somewhat, ahem. reduced state?’\nOUTLINE: ‘She has great telepathic abilities, Doctor. The more time she has spent in this sector of space. the more her abilities bore fruit - I was formless in the Matrix before I touched her mind.... She gave me iife in this universe: The Doctor doubts that a human mind is capable of such a transmogrification.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor finally regains consciousness. to find Sentia leaning over him. He tells her that he agrees to Omega's request - but there's something very important he has to do first.\nOUTLINE: Sentia sounds the alarm on the heritage centre and everybody duly assembles. Sentia offers them complimentary food and drink. The oldsters gratefully dodder off to the recreation cenure. which Sentia then makes secure. so none of them can dodder back again.\nOUTLINE: Moments later. Glinda and Maven wander through the empty ship. confused where everyone has gone. They decide to wait in the tour shuttle.\nOUTLINE: Tarpov is babbling incoherently in the medical wing when a figure joins him. Omega’s voice is heard.\" You will not give Sentia the truth. Vandekan...”\nOUTLINE: He is strangled.\nOUTLINE: Captain Daland is hurrying from the bridge having heard the alarm. He is unnerved by the arrival of the ghost ship and wants to leave quickly.\nOUTLINE: He meets Sentia, who mocks him for his cowardice. Daland demands to know where the passengers are. but Sentia refuses to tell him. Daland is set to take the shunie and desert everybody. Sentia pulls a gun on him and says she’s taking the shuttle. She orders him back to the flight deck of the tour shuttle.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is about to leave for Omega's ship. when Professor Corrigan joins him, and begs him to take him on board. He has no TARDIS of his own. and would dearty love to take a closer look at the ship. The Doctor retuctanty agrees.\nOUTLINE: Omegz’s ship is an eerie. echoey place. Corrigan goes off to take his own readings.\nOUTLINE: Omega manages to manifest himself before the Doctor. using the extra psychic energy from being at the epicentre of the Sector of Forgotten Souls.\nOUTLINE: ‘There is so much psionic energy. 1 am now Iterally an idea given form!\nOUTLINE: *... AS long as you suzy in this sector of space.\nOUTLINE: ‘Ironic. is it not? To give myself existence. [ must return to the place where I was betrayed and destroyed’\nOUTLINE: They work together to revive the ship's motors. When Omega tries to activate chem using his personal palm print. nothing happens. The Doctor suggests constructing a device linked to the engines that can jump-start and contol them electronically.\nOUTLINE: Like kids working on a train set. they lash up a handheld device to activate the engines. They chat. the Doctor admitting it is an odd situation to be in.\nOUTLINE: ‘To be working on a project with a bitter enemy? asks Omega.\nOUTLINE: “No, to work on a project with one of your heroes-\nOUTLINE: Omega is taken aback. The Doctor is keen to dis2buse Omega of the notion that he had no sympathy for his plight.“You were an inspiration to me. your desire to innovate and explore and to do all those things... And then to be stuck in one place and one time - it's almost too close for comfort for me_\nOUTLINE: They talk of Omega’s betrayal by Rassilon. There is a characteristic flash of the okd Omega anger. before he caims himself with the thought that ~whar is past is past’.\nOUTLINE: “Inchiding the Scintillans?’ asks the Doctor.\nOUTLINE: 37\nOUTLINE: Before Omega can reply, the Doctor activates the device, and the engines kick in. ‘Eureka!’\nOUTLINE: The Professor is analysing the corridor when he hears the engines. ‘The sound of history’ He catches a glimpse of a pale figure who tries to talk to him, but flickers and dies. The Professor wonders who it could be.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor, feeling his work is done, says goodbye to Omega, feeling he has somewhat misjudged him in the past, and wishes him well on his way, but Omega stops him to make his second request. He wants the TARDIS dimensional control to stabilise this sector of space, so Sentia can join him.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is taken aback by and points out the catch-22 in his plan. To stabilise the area of space for Sentia to join them, the TARDIS will need to be immobilised, and how can Sentia get to Omega’s ship without the TARDIS?\nOUTLINE: Omega tells him she will join them using the tour shuttle. The Doctor refuses. He is unnerved by the incident with Shezion and Tarpov. ‘Take that away and the tourists are stuck in this part of space. They could go mad’\nOUTLINE: Omega assures him the shuttle won’t be needed for long. The Doctor reluctantly agrees.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor and Omega stabilise the sector of space. It immediately grows cold.\nOUTLINE: Fleeting images appear before Corrigan, images of Omega and Vandekan appear, silently recreating a scene from millennia ago. Excited, he goes to tell the Doctor.\nOUTLINE: The tour ship docks. Omega loses cohesion and vanishes.\nOUTLINE: The Professor finds the Doctor and tells him of the vision of Omega and Vandekan:'It’s like history were alive, and trying to tell us what really happened here’\nOUTLINE: ‘Um... Professor.... Prepare yourself for a shock...’\nOUTLINE: Sentia and Daland arrive. The Doctor apologies to Sentia for Omega’s absence, and explains his manifestation is far from stable. Sentia assures him that she can definitely feel that Omega is nearby. The Doctor explains to an already excited Professor that Omega is alive and on the ship.\nOUTLINE: ‘Td love to talk to him, I feel like I’ve met him already.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is surprised by Sentia'’s exotic new outfit, but the reason for it is soon explained. Sentia says she is to be married to Omega.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor and Corrigan are astonished, and Daland is incredulous.‘ You dumped me for a two million year old ghost?’\nOUTLINE: ‘He's a damn sight more substantial than you.\nOUTLINE: ‘Who's going to conduct the ceremony?’ asks Daland.\nOUTLINE: “You:\nOUTLINE: ‘Me?’\nOUTLINE: ‘You're a captain of a ship - in a vague sense of the word - you can conduct the service:\nOUTLINE: The Doctor had just taken her as being another of Omega’s fanatical followers.‘I’m a good deal more than that, Doctor’ Sentia explains how Omega came to her in her dreams, and how they got to know each other.\nOUTLINE: She tells him she’s always wanted to travel and see the universe, and find out what's ‘out there’.The best she could do was a hostess on a tour shuttle.\nOUTLINE: She understands Omega, and why he was driven to discover the secrets of time. The Doctor sympathises with her. Omega says he will show her a universe - his own. Sentia leaves to collect some things from the shuttle.\nOUTLINE: Daland is confused, as all he knows about Omega is by rote from the tour - and naturally he thought Omega dead. Corrigan gives him a potted account of the Doctor's\nOUTLINE: 378\nOUTLINE: encounters with Omega - the black hole, and Omega’s attempt to bond with him for existence in this universe.\nOUTLINE: They are interrupted by a call from Sentia on his communicator. Shezion has stowed aboard the tour ship, and has smashed up the flight deck. It’s a write-off. He is hiding somewhere in the ship... Sentia apologises to Daland.\nOUTLINE: Daland is still incredulous. ‘So my ex-fiancé is marrying a multi-dimensional thing composed of pure anti-matter, a mythical figure from the dawn of time...’\nOUTLINE: ‘Yes.\nOUTLINE: ‘Well, when it gets to the part about knowing any just cause or impediment, they’d better not ask me:\nOUTLINE: The Doctor says it’s rather more serious than that. ‘Did you hear the way she apologised to you?’\nOUTLINE: ‘Well, she would, wouldn’t she? Not that ’'m moping of course:\nOUTLINE: ‘I don’t think she was considering your feelings. I’ve got a feeling that Omega won’t want to leave his new bride at the altar. He'll want to take her with him - which means that he’ll need the TARDIS’s dimensional control to stabilise this area of space and keep it habitable for humans - right up to the point they go through... But the shuttle is damaged, and we can’t leave via the TARDIS.\nOUTLINE: “You mean?’\nOUTLINE: ‘We're going to have to go through with him’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor’s never considered any of his enemies to have romantic inclinations, and is dumbfounded. Daland says they must leave. He proposes grabbing Sentia by force and getting out of here.The Doctor refuses - for the moment. Like it or not, he owes a debt to Omega for his sacrifice, and if Sentia wishes to journey into the other universe of her own free will, then he does not feel he has the right to stop them.\nOUTLINE: Daland is aghast at the Doctor's reasoning. ‘Even if he takes us with him?’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor just changes the subject. ‘Let's go and see if the shuttle’s engines are repairable, there’s a good fellow:\nOUTLINE: Leaving Professor Corrigan to track down his mystical images, the Doctor and Daland join Sentia in the tour ship in the hunt for Shezion. They search the forward compartments and succeed only in finding the body of Tarpov, who has been stuffed into the forward compartments.They assume he died through shock and loss of blood - until they see the marks on his neck. He had been strangled.\nOUTLINE: ‘Shezion?’ asks Daland.\nOUTLINE: ‘Probably, says the Doctor.‘We have to be careful?\nOUTLINE: Shezion comes out of nowhere and attacks the Doctor.\nOUTLINE: ‘Lam Omega, there can be only one, my brother Time Lord.\nOUTLINE: PART THREE\nOUTLINE: Shezion sees Sentia and rushes towards her. He appears to want to tell her something, but Daland instinctively knocks him unconscious. They agree they must secure him somewhere. The Doctor suggests the fusion chambers of Omega's ship as a good place, as that’s the most secure part, and asks Daland to take him down there in case he turns on Sentia.\nOUTLINE: After Daland and Shezion leave, the Doctor and Sentia are astonished, as Glinda and Maven appear. They've been sitting in their seats for quite some time and have grown tired of waiting. They were impressed by the show, however, and by Shezion's acting skills, which have improved considerably ‘since the first house’.\nOUTLINE: 379\nOUTLINE: The Doctor switches on his charm and advises the ladies to stay in the shuttle and await ‘the end of the tour’.\nOUTLINE: Daland puts the unconscious Shezion in the fusion chambers. On his way back, Daland is confronted with the white, ghostly image. It says in a high fey voice, ‘going to help you... Must have patience’ He cuns after it.\nOUTLINE: It goes completely dark. Daland feels hands around his throat and hears Omega’s voice - full of fury at Daland’s insolence earlier.\nOUTLINE: Sentia interrupts him, and persuades him to leave him alone. Daland slumps unconscious to the floor.\nOUTLINE: ‘At last we can talk freely my darling - the Doctor isn’t here...’\nOUTLINE: ‘The Doctor is a good man, rumbles Omega. ‘He is a good man. He has helped us:\nOUTLINE: ‘Yes.\nOUTLINE: ‘We must stay apart until the time is right. There is too much confusion here:\nOUTLINE: ‘What a delightful scene; says the Doctor acidly.\nOUTLINE: Corrigan discovers Daland’s form, and is relieved to find him simply unconscious. He hears voices - the Doctor's and another voice.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is talking to Omega. The Doctor is angry. He feels Omega has something to do with the death of Tarpov.\nOUTLINE: ‘Look at me, Doctor. I am far too insubstantial. You know that’\nOUTLINE: ‘You have an agent to do your bidding. Her perhaps:\nOUTLINE: ‘Sentia, leave us.\nOUTLINE: Sentia leaves.\nOUTLINE: ‘She knows nothing. And that is how it must stay. She must not be told about the Scintillans’\nOUTLINE: ‘Is this what this is about? Did you think Vandekan was more than a role to Tarpov? That he had access to what Vandekan knew?’\nOUTLINE: ‘Anything is possible in this place. She will not see that what I did was in the name of science:\nOUTLINE: ‘That’s wasn’t science. That was genocide:\nOUTLINE: ‘All technological invention is genocide, Doctor. We create a new world and we destroy the old?\nOUTLINE: ‘That's slippery logic:\nOUTLINE: ‘Look at your humans and their love of invention. Their fevel of technology goes up, the number of indigenous species goes down. Their science enables numbers of their species to live on past their point of potential...’\nOUTLINE: ‘In your opinion...’\nOUTLINE: ‘And to destroy other members before they have the potential to do anything’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is silent on this point.\nOUTLINE: ‘All my life, I saw as you did hatred and evil throughout the cosmos; says Omega, ‘and like you I wanted to do something about it... I wanted mastery over time - so I could sculpt the universe and make it beautiful. Like the statue of me in the Great Hall of the Academy.\nOUTLINE: “Were it not for me, you'd be still grovelling in the dirt of Gallifrey with alt your Time Lord peers’\nOUTLINE: Professor Corrigan breaks cover and joins the Doctor. Omega is nowhere to be seen. Corrigan says he heard him taiking to Omega and asks him about the Scintillans.\nOUTLINE: ‘If I could find out the secret of Omega, 1 can die happy’\nOUTLINE: “You want to know my secret? My secret is that I am mad’\nOUTLINE: The Professor is faced with Omega. He cannot believe what he is witnessing.\nOUTLINE: 380\nOUTLINE: ‘Then you will have your wish, and you can die happy:\nOUTLINE: The Doctor and Omega struggle with each other, but the Doctor cannot stop Omega from strangling the Professor.\nOUTLINE: Maven and Glinda are sick of waiting in the tour shuttle. They decide to go back into what they think is the heritage centre to find the Captain and give them a piece of their minds,\nOUTLINE: The ship lurches and Daland awakens, feeling his neck. He hears Sentia calling him - she’s come back to see if he’s all right. The Doctor joins them. He says Omega is more powerful than he thought. He’s killed Corrigan. Sentia refuses to believe him, but comes back to the bridge.\nOUTLINE: They come back to the bridge. The Doctor looks the battered Daland over to see if he’s all right. Sentia asks what made the ship lurch. The Doctor checks the dimensional stabiliser - then has a sickening thought. The remote control has gone. He guesses someone has activated the ship’s engines, effectively vaporising Shezion.\nOUTLINE: ‘Tarpov, Corrigan, now Shezion. Omega is mad:\nOUTLINE: The Doctor searches vainly for the remote. It has gone. Sentia says she doesn’t believe that Omega is a murderer. The Omega she knows wouldn't do this. The Doctor says the time for talking is over, and they will leave. Omega can send the ship into his universe at any time. He tells the others to wait near the TARDIS, and goes to get Glinda and Maven back.\nOUTLINE: He finds Omega ~ with the detonator in his hand. Omega's voice is full of menace.‘See in my hand, Doctor. The remote detonator... I have secured the two elderly females in the fusion chamber.The wedding will continue or it will not just be the bride who is toasted.\nOUTLINE: ‘You are my best man, Doctor. It is up to you to make the service run smoothly.\nOUTLINE: Glinda and Maven are sitting impatiently in the fusion chamber. ‘He said to wait here for the holographic presentation; says Glinda.‘Honestly, this is the worst tour we've ever been on:\nOUTLINE: The vision of Omega and Vandekan appears before them. ‘Oh, this place goes from bad to worse; says Glinda. ‘The sound has broken on the hologram now. Maven is shaking her head, staring at the ghostly figures. ‘The story is so sad... so sad...’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor returns and relays Omega’s instructions. Sentia is still quite sanguine about the prospect, much to Daland's outrage. ‘He's killed three people and threatened to kill two more, and you're fine about this?’\nOUTLINE: Sentia says it’s for the best.\nOUTLINE: The door of the fusion chamber clangs open to let out Glinda and Maven. It is Shezion. Maven is still shaking her head ‘So sad... Such a shame about the poor Scintillans...’\nOUTLINE: Shezion says,“You know... don't you? You know...’\nOUTLINE: Omega appears triumphantly in all his finery, ready for the service...\nOUTLINE: ... At least, that’s what the Doctor sees. The others just see empty space. No one is there.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is getting extremely agitated. He insists Omega is stili there, and insists the service continue while Omega still has enough stable energy to manifest himself. They try to teil him there’s no one there.\nOUTLINE: As far as the Doctor is concerned, Omega is there, but weakening. He disappears.\nOUTLINE: Glinda and Maven arrive, freed by Shezion. ‘That's the man!’ They accuse the Doctor of locking them in the fusion generator.‘No, that was Omega, says the bemused Doctor. ‘He locked you in there and threatened to use the...'- the Doctor pulls something out of his pocket and stares at it - ‘.,. remote detonator...’\nOUTLINE: 381\nOUTLINE: ‘Like the one you've pulled from your pocket, Doctor?’ says Daland, unnerved by his strange behaviour.‘I'd give that to me if I were you...’\nOUTLINE: ‘No, the wedding service is going ahead. If Omega can’t make it, Sentia will have to marry the best man.\nOUTLINE: ‘You? You're mad!\" says Daland.\nOUTLINE: ‘Don’t say that!’ says the Doctor with venom, brandishing the remote.\nOUTLINE: There is a tense stand-off, broken by Sentia shouting, ‘Perform the ceremony Daland - for God's sake!’\nOUTLINE: The pale creature appears once again, shimmering in front of them.\nOUTLINE: ‘It’s that alien’ breathes Sentia - looks like it’s starting to manifest itself. It finally takes a very human shape, and a very familiar looking form. The sounds slowly resolve into words.\nOUTLINE: ‘How do you do, says the figure.‘I’(m the Doctor’.\nOUTLINE: PART FOUR\nOUTLINE: ‘Phew, I’m glad that’s over.A Time Ring is many things, but one thing it és7’t is first-class travel. says the Doctor.\nOUTLINE: The newly arrived Doctor advances towards the ‘Doctor’. The ‘Doctor’ is in a state of shock.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor tries to reassure the ‘Doctor’ that everything will be all right, but Sentia grabs the ‘Doctor's’ hand and they run from the room.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor heads for the TARDIS and pats it with relief. He examines the temporal stabiliser. ‘What a lash-up. A miracle it worked. Still, not bad for a two-million-year-old legend:\nOUTLINE: ‘You're the Doctor?’ says Daland.\nOUTLINE: ‘Absolutely. Wouldn't be anyone else. Well, not yet, anyway.\nOUTLINE: ‘So, who’s the other bloke?’\nOUTLINE: ‘Him? Oh, he’s Omega:\nOUTLINE: The Doctor explains why he’s here. When Omega bonded with him to enter this universe, it was assumed it was a failure, but it was in fact a partial success.\nOUTLINE: The result - a thing with an identity crisis. Part Doctor, part Omega. He was notified of Omega’s existence and went back to twentieth-century Earth to intercept him, but while Omega thought he was the Doctor, he took his TARDIS.\nOUTLINE: ‘Unfortunately due to the instability of this region, it was playing merry hell with the Time Ring’ He's been pursuing him through time and space - to here. ‘Like a salmon swimming upstream - he’s come to the place where it all started. I wonder why.\nOUTLINE: Daland tells him Omega’s plans of marriage and his departure to his own universe?\nOUTLINE: ‘Of course - to be whole. This Sentia must give him some kind of identity - a telepathic link. Her belief in him must be very strong’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor/Omega is struggling to come to term with his identity - his voice is now\nOUTLINE: drifting between the Doctor's lighter tones and the gravelly voice of Omega. ‘Come on, Omega’\nOUTLINE: ‘But, I'm the Doctor...’\nOUTLINE: ‘No, Omega, you're Omega, says Sentia.‘Sometimes you think you’re the Doctor - when you're not yourself. You told me to call you the Doctor, when you forgot who you were.\nOUTLINE: ‘I remember now... I killed Tarpov... and Professor Corrigan...’\nOUTLINE: ‘That’s right, my darling, I know. I helped you dispose of Tarpov’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is told about the murders. He realises Omega is dangerously mad, and\nOUTLINE: 382\nOUTLINE: could activate the remote. He needs to get him back into the other universe, pacify him - or destroy him - and get Shezion and Sentia safe. He tells Daland, Maven and Glinda to wait by the TARDIS, and goes to find Omega.\nOUTLINE: Maven is still shaking her head, and saying how sad it is. Daland asks Glinda what Maven thinks is terribly sad.\nOUTLINE: ‘The story of Omega and Vandekan, of course, says Glinda. ‘The story from that projection with no sound. Lucky Maven here, being as deaf as a burrowing skank, is able to lip read, or we'd have made no sense of it at all.’\nOUTLINE: The Doctor is confronted by Shezion, who in his madness, begins to perform a ‘revised version’ of his scene with Tarpov in Part One.Tarpov of course fails to appear.\nOUTLINE: ‘I’m afraid your co-star won't make his cue, Shezion’\nOUTLINE: To the Doctor's surprise, a ghostly Tarpov does, and they re-enact the story that Maven has learned.\nOUTLINE: Glinda tells Daland what Maven has learned. Omega’s experiment, and how Vandekan found out the dark secret behind it. He tried to stop it, but he was too late.\nOUTLINE: Omega searched for many decades to find the right kind of star to detonate and provide the Time Lords with energy, and he found one which was perfect, one called Kasterill - the only problem was, one of the planets orbiting it held life.An advanced race of telepathic beings called the Scintillans. Omega went ahead with the decision to detonate the sun, but told nobody on the project. He sent an entire race to its death.\nOUTLINE: Whilst in the ship preparing to detonate the sun, Assistant Engineer Vandekan was contacted by the Scintillans, and was made aware of their existence. He confronted Omega about it.The engines on the ship required the palm prints of the whole crew to activate the destructor. When Vandekan refused, his hand was cut off. Somehow, Vandekan managed to escape with his hand, made his way to the fusion chamber and thrust his other hand into the engines.\nOUTLINE: He lost consciousness and failed to destroy his other hand. He was found and killed, and his remaining hand used to start the engines. The ship’s computers detected the ‘impurity’ in the engines, and shut down, sending the ship into the event horizon.\nOUTLINE: Daland thinks the story important enough to tell the Doctor. He goes to find him.\nOUTLINE: The Doctor has learned much the same from Shezion and “Tarpov’. The Doctor is starting to realise what is wrong with Omega, and what the images were.\nOUTLINE: Daland finds Sentia running for help. She is desperate. Omega is ill and weakened. She begs for him to help.‘He’s not a bad man... Not a bad man. She is starting to become deranged. Daland reluctantly accompanies her.\nOUTLINE: Omega is on his own and ‘Tarpov' appears in front of him. Omega starts arguing with him like he is the real Vandekan. ‘You were no scientist. It could have been a thousand years before we found another suitable star - and what would have happened if the Daleks or the War Lords succeeded before us? We had to be there first,\nOUTLINE: The Doctor and Shezion find Omega, still arguing with the ghostly Tarpov. He tries to strike a bargain with him - to set up a self-contained dimensional force generator, so the\nTARDIS: can leave with others. He has something important to tell Omega - but Omega is too angry and confused to listen to his offer or his information.\nTARDIS: ‘You and your kind never had to make a hard decision in your lives, Doctor. You step aside while worlds are conquered and friends die, and your hands are clean. It is the ones of true greatness who have to get their hands stained:\nTARDIS: ‘At least you had hands, Omega, says ‘Tarpov’.\nTARDIS: Omega rails at him, and tries to grab empty air. Shezion says he is Omega, and there must be only one. He attacks Omega, and Omega kills him. ‘Tarpov’ vanishes.\nTARDIS: 383\nTARDIS: Omega advances on the Doctor. ‘Traitors. All of you. Traitors. The Scintiflans were a price that had to be paid...’\nTARDIS: ‘The Scintillans, Omega?’ says the Doctor. ‘But what if they came here, roaring their revenge...?’\nTARDIS: There is an unearthly howl.'The fact we stabilised this sector of space has enabled the Scintillans to manifest. That’s why this area of space is so rich in psionic energy; says the Doctor.‘The residue of the Scintillans’ own energy is still around us:\nTARDIS: ‘The Scintillans have come to tell you what they think of the end justifying the means.’ Creatures appear, and attack Omega and roaring with anguish, he runs off, pursued by them.The Doctor follows.\nTARDIS: Sentia and Daland find what they think is Omega, but it’s the Doctor.‘Omega has still got the remote. We have to leave-\nTARDIS: ‘No, we're not leaving my Omega, cries Sentia, and runs into the ship. Daland and the Doctor have no choice but to follow.\nTARDIS: The creatures disappear. Omega is left, confused and howling like a wounded animal. Sentia runs to his side and calms him.\nTARDIS: The Doctor is frantic.‘Omega, 1 know what's wrong, and I have to tell you, it’s your only hope:\nTARDIS: ‘I know what's wrong, Doctor - spineless grubs like you and Vandekan-\nTARDIS: ‘Vandekan didn’t do anything!’\nTARDIS: Omega changes... abruptly sorrowful.‘No, he didn't, ] did’ You must never know what I did, he says to Sentia.‘I had to kill them, they could have told you about my crime, and you couldn't forgive me’\nTARDIS: “You must never know why... You must never let it get in the way of us’\nTARDIS: ‘But I do know, darling. I asked Shezion. He told me about the Scintilians... and it doesn’t matter, It doesn’t change us, it doesn’t change what we have together...’\nTARDIS: ‘It doesn't matter?) Omega/Doctor says hysterically. ‘I committed genocide and it doesn’t matter to you? What kind of woman are you? You're a monster!\nTARDIS: Omega's hands close around her throat.\nTARDIS: The Doctor and Daland tries to pull him off, to no avail. Omega releases her. Wounded and barely conscious, she crawls along the floor. You're ill, Omega, I know how to cure you. She has crawled towards the remote control, which has been dropped in the struggle.\nTARDIS: ‘Sentia, no!’ says the Doctor, but she presses it. The engines start, and the ship starts moving. Daland tries to save Sentia, but Omega is holding her tightly, and refuses to let go. The Doctor and Daland run for the TARDIS.\nTARDIS: ‘Sentia, what have you done?’ says a distraught Omega.\nTARDIS: ‘Taking us into your universe, my love, just as we intended.\nTARDIS: ‘The Doctor will leave... without the TARDIS, you'll be torn apart’\nTARDIS: ‘You've already torn me apart, my dear. Hold me. Sorry, my love’\nTARDIS: Sentia is scattered into the void. Alone again, Omega screams with anguish. Omega’s ship makes its last journey back into his kingdom.\nTARDIS: Back in the TARDIS, a saddened Doctor is at the controls. He was a great man, Omega, he didn’t deserve a fate like that. He doesn’t deserve to be alone. None of us does...\nTARDIS: ‘Serves him right. Omega killed all the Scintillans, didn't he?’\nTARDIS: ‘None of that was true. Omega didn’t destroy a race. He was a decent man.There were no Scintillans. I lied to him again:\nTARDIS: ‘But the images of Omega and Vandekan...’\nTARDIS: 384\nTARDIS: ‘Oh, yes, they were manifestations of his guilt about killing the Scintillans. His telepathic abilities as aTime Lord amplified in the Sector of Forgotten Souls, Part of him was trying to tell us what he’d done, part of him was murdering to cover it up’\nTARDIS: ‘So he was guilty about killing the Scintillans?’\nTARDIS: ‘Part of him was, yes. Because part of him was me’\nTARDIS: The Doctor sighed. ‘I killed the Scintillans.A number of them attacked an Earth colony in the Nexus cluster. I devised a way to stop them. The trouble was, the method I used wiped out the last of their race. When he bonded with me, my memories became his, he thought he did it, and couldn’t cope with it. He’s not as used to killing as I am.\nTARDIS: ‘He never understood why Vandekan did what he did, he thought Rassilon betrayed him, but he didn’t really believe. He wove the Scintillans into the story of Vandekan and gave Vandekan some motivation.\nTARDIS: ‘Vandekan wasn’t a conscientious objector out to save a race. Neither was he an agent of Rassilon. He cut his hands off because he was just a man who went mad. Like Shezion, like Tarpov, Just like so many others who go mad in this sector of space. One madman, who doomed Omega’s ship and sent him into oblivion, just as we've done once again.\nTARDIS: ‘I've failed Omega in various ways in the past - this time I failed him completely’.\nTARDIS: The Doctor drops Daland, Maven and Glinda on the heritage centre, where a rescue ship is docking. They leave the TARDIS, wary of the Doctor; they’ve got to know him a little too well, he can see it in their eyes.\nTARDIS: We end on a similar tour to the same area of space many centuries in the future. This tour guide is telling the story of the Doctor and his great deed in sending the great hero\nTARDIS: Omega and Sentia to lead a new life in another universe.\nTARDIS: One of the passengers - who happens to be a Doctor - ventures a different, more tragic take on events. And he is told in no uncertain terms.\nTARDIS: ‘I don’t think so. The Doctor was a great hero, and heroes don’t let things like that happen:\nTARDIS: 385"
