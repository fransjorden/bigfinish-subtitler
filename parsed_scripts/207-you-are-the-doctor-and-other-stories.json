It’s like King Kong’s gym locker...\nDOCTOR: (INNOCENT) Is this not where you intended us to land?\nACE: Course it’s not.\nDOCTOR: Well, no-one manages perfectly on their first attempt.\nACE: That’s not the problem. I wanted Australia! I wanted sun, sea and sand. Not Walthamstow sewage plant...\nDOCTOR: The atmosphere is far from fragrant, I’ll admit. But it isn’t a sewage plant. Can’t you feel the engines? That whirr. We’re in flight.\nACE: I don’t care if we’re in orbit, this place stinks. Literally and metaphorically.\nDOCTOR: No, we’re not in orbit. This isn’t artificial gravity, it’s the real thing. The hold of an airship, perhaps?\nACE: Can we go?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 3\nDOCTOR: Oh, come now, Ace. You’1l never know what you’re missing out on if you don’t explore.\nACE: Please, Doctor. I got it wrong. I admit that. I didn’t program the co-ordinates correctly. Let me try again and find somewhere nice.\nDOCTOR: But we don’t know what mistake you made. Is this the right time, but the wrong place? Are we nearby or the other end of the universe? Finding out what went wrong will help us compensate.\nACE: I can follow my nose. And my nose wants out of here. Well? Doctor?\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) Well, Doctor? What do you do?\nCHIMBLY: Life’s full of difficult decisions for a wandering Time Lord, isn’t it? One way there’s peril. Another there’s danger. Make the right choices or YOU WILL DIE! You are the Doctor! And you decide!\nCHIMBLY: So if you agree with Ace, and choose to depart, continue to time-track two.

Blimey, this is the messiest ship I’ve ever been on. Do they chuck out any rubbish? Haven’t they heard of bins?\nDOCTOR: From the look of things they just pile it up and hope it rots away. Strange. If they’ve the technology for a flying ship, you’d think cleaning wouldn’t be beyond them...\nACE: This place is a pig-sty!\nDOCTOR: (BEAT. WORRIED REALISATION) Yes.

(BEAT; SOTTO) You know, all these guards have ear implants...\nACE: (SOTTO) They’re being controlled?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Probably. It can’t be the most sophisticated system, judging by the technology. If I can make the implants retransmit all received data back to themselves, that’d set up a feedback loop and interfere with the command network.

Chimbly of the Porcians. As I expected.\nCHIMBLY: So Doctor. We meet again.\nACE: Pig aliens. Well, that explains the smell.\nDOCTOR: The Porcians are the most inept alien invaders in history. They’ve turned failure at planetary conquest into an art form.\nCHIMBLY: Oi, shut it!\nKEITH: You can’t talk down to us cos you’re tall. We run this planet now, stick that in your pipe and smoke it.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think we’ve had the pleasure. Who’s this, Chimbly, another one of your sons?\nCHIMBLY: She’s my wife.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nACE: That’s a woman?\nACE: 10\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 11\nKEITH: Watch it, face-ache.\nCHIMBLY: She’s a diamond. In our language, her name means ‘She that Defiles Dreams and Stamps on Hope’.\nDOCTOR: Which is pronounced in English...?\nKEITH: Keith.\nDOCTOR: Of course it is.\nCHIMBLY: What a treat to find you here, Doctor. When I saw your TARDIS land, I couldn’t have been happier. Now you can be my slave like everyone else on this stupid planet.\nACE: You reckon? Well, I’ve news for you, little piggy, you’d better watch out, he’s the big bad wolf, come to blow your house down.\nKEITH: I’d like to see him try!\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) Well, if that’s not an invitation, Doctor, then what is? Do you dive for the computer controls and set up a feedback loop to disable all the guards through their ear implants? If so, go to track 6. If you allow yourself to be led to the prison cells, go to track 7.\nCHIMBLY: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 12\nTRACK: 6\nTRACK: SCENE 8. INT.

That should disable them long enough for us to destroy your control systems permanently. Fingers in ears, Ace.\nACE: Right you are!\nCHIMBLY: Oh, stuff this. Keith, operate the trap doors.\nKEITH: Will do.\nKEITH: (KEITH OPERATES A CONTROL. A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR BENEATH THE DOCTOR AND ACE AND THEY DROP THROUGH INTO THE OPEN AIR)\nDOCTOR: Aaargh!\nACE: Aaargh!\nCHIMBLY: (SHOUTING DOWN AFTER THEM) I had vents installed all over the bridge, Doctor! In case anyone tried anything funny. It’s a straight drop down to the planet’s surface!\nKEITH: Yeah! How high up are we?\nCHIMBLY: High enough. Mile or so. (CALLS DOWN) Happy landings Doctor!\nKEITH: Happy landings!\nKEITH: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 13\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) Yes, that is quite some fall, isn’t it?

Of course.\nKEITH: Only those two humans got out really easily last week.\nCHIMBLY: I know. That’s why I’ve fixed them, love of my life.\nKEITH: I think you should probably fix them.\nCHIMBLY: (FURIOUS) I have fixed them! I literally just told you I'd fixed them!\nKEITH: Cos you don’t want these two getting out.\nCHIMBLY: I KNOW! Have you been on the cooking sherry again?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK) I’m glad to see you’ve finally managed to achieve your dream of planetary conquest, Chimbly. How on Earth did you manage that after all these years?\nACE: Was it a bank holiday?\nCHIMBLY: Is it too much to believe we just did everything perfectly?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nCHIMBLY: Well, then, what can I say.

Seriously, do I have to do everything around here?\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) Oh, what a pity, Doctor. You’re dead. It was time- track 9 and the cells. Obviously. For you, the adventure is over.

The population not obeying you as much as you'd like?\nCHIMBLY: Yeah, well, we’ve been having some bother with the natives, lately. They’ve been getting... testy.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nCHIMBLY: We got low on provisions, you see. Costs a lot of money feeding a slave army, no-one ever tells you that.\nACE: Oh, my heart bleeds.\nCHIMBLY: Then these two chancers sold us frozen food, turned out to be rotten. They’d done us over. But we soon taught them a lesson.\nKEITH: (QUIETLY) Until they broke out of the cell.\nCHIMBLY: (FURIOUS) You’1ll never let it go, will you!\nKEITH: You said I could kill them!\nCHIMBLY: I make one mistake, I never hear the end of it.

You’ve embarrassed me in front of the Doctor now. I am so sorry.\nDOCTOR: Not a problem. So we wait here, yes?\nCHIMBLY: That’s it. Wait here. The surgeon’1ll be along any moment. Then you'll rejoin us. As — our — slaves! (HE LAUGHS MANIACALLY. STOPS. SILENCE) Yeah, that was an exit line, wasn’t it? I should have gone. Sorry. Spoilt my moment...\nKEITH: That goes double for me and all!\nACE: Right. So we’re just going to wait here to get implanted?\nDOCTOR: Seemingly so.\nACE: I dunno, Doctor. Something fishy’s going on here, we’re not usually this passive.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’ve got the strangest sense of deja vu. I feel like I’m being manipulated...\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION, SHARPLY) Don’t let it worry you.

They’re psychic amplifiers...\nACE: Yeah, that is interesting. What’s going on here, Katrice?\nKATRICE: I don’t know! We keep trying to fight back, rebel. But they stop us every time! No-one can get close, they’re always killed! It’s like the Porcians know what’s coming!\nCHIMBLY: Sorry, sorry, forgot to plug your equipment in.\nKATRICE: What are you doing, I need no assistance, it’s working\nKATRICE: perfectly —\nCHIMBLY: Hold this probe would you?\nCHIMBLY: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 27\nKATRICE: Why?\nCHIMBLY: And switch it on at the wall —\nCHIMBLY: (HE FLICKS A SWITCH.

I suppose with your know-how, you could probably help out Katrice here, get through implanting the rest of the population.\nDOCTOR: My pleasure.\nCHIMBLY: Good. Then we’re sorted.\nCHIMBLY: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 30\nDOCTOR: Off to work we go.\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) Who would you rather follow?

I’m sure something bad happened back there, but I don’t remember it.\nDOCTOR: I know what you mean. Something’s very wrong here, Ace.\nACE: It might have been to do with that room down the corridor. The security suite. You remember, the one with the guard?\nDOCTOR: Yes, the security suite, that was odd, wasn’t it? Certainly suspicious. We’ve not been in there. Perhaps we should rectify that omission now?\nCHIMBLY: (NARRATION) No. No, you shouldn’t.

Here we are.\nACE: Blimey.\nDOCTOR: Well. That explains everything.\nACE: It does?\nRESURRECTIONIST: Help me...\nDOCTOR: That’s a Resurrectionist, Ace. An extra-dimensional being. They’re almost extinct.\nACE: Looks like it’s wired into the mainframe.\nDOCTOR: It has psychic abilities. I imagine the Porcians have been amplifying its powers to control the populace. Some of its powers. It has another skill they’d find even more useful.\nRESURRECTIONIST: Help me...\nACE: Don’t worry, we'll get you out of here. Well, go on, it’s other skill?\nDOCTOR: The clue’s in the name. Resurrectionist. Very compassionate creatures. They can reverse time for the newly dead. Return them to life at an earlier part of their time stream. Then psychically steer them from the path that led to their death in the first place.\nACE: So you can fix time the way you want?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 44\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The only flaw is they absorb each death into themselves, they feel the pain. The more times they save a life, the greater the pain becomes. It’s why they couldn’t save their own species.\nACE: That’s awful.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it? But it gets worse. The Porcians must have been using this poor creature to kill and resurrect the inhabitants of this planet over and over again, until they got the world they desired. They’ve probably done it to us too. We wouldn’t even know.\nACE: They’ve been killing me? Just when I thought I couldn’t hate them any more...\nRESURRECTIONIST: The pain is.. unbearable...\nACE: You'll be free soon, don’t you worry about that.\nCHIMBLY: (BREATHLESS) Oh no, she won’t!\nKEITH: And you two don’t get out of here neither!\nDOCTOR: Chimbly. Am I glad to see you. (BEAT) No. Seemingly I’m not.\nKEITH: I thought you said this room was secure?\nCHIMBLY: The guard needed a comfort break, how was I supposed to know?\nKEITH: Mother was right about you! I should have married Grunthar! He’s got a penthouse. And a pool.\nCHIMBLY: Shut it!\nCHIMBLY: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page\nDOCTOR: Well, Chimbly. This explains everything. You found this poor creature and you’ve been using it to fix your mistakes. Torturing it into actualising your pathetic fantasies. Murdering the people of this planet endlessly until you get your own way.\nCHIMBLY: And bringing them back to life again, be fair.\nACE: You’re warped. Sick!\nCHIMBLY: And in charge!\nDOCTOR: Then you used it to prevent me from finding out and stopping you. Fortunately, it opted not to control my mind completely. I don’t think it likes you very much.\nCHIMBLY: Well, woop-de-do. You’ve worked it out. Big deal. I just kill you, that thing takes time back, and you’re my slave again. Night-night!\nACE: Watch out, Doctor!\nACE: (HE BLASTS AT THE DOCTOR, WHO DARTS OUT OF THE WAY. THE\nCOMPUTER: NETWORK EXPLODES IN SPARKS BEHIND)\nKEITH: Of course he’s going to dive out of the way, you numpty!\nCHIMBLY: Well, if you’d stop shouting in my ear for two seconds and let me concentrate —\nRESURRECTIONIST: My cage has gone! I’m free! FREE!\nCHIMBLY: What?\nACE: She’s fading away!\nRESURRECTIONIST: (FADING AWAY) Thank you, Doctor...\nRESURRECTIONIST: 45\nRESURRECTIONIST: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 46\nACE: Where did she go?\nCHIMBLY: No, no, no, um... let’s go back and —\nDOCTOR: No, Chimbly, I’m afraid you can’t rewrite time again. It’s over.\nCHIMBLY: What did you do?\nDOCTOR: I knew you’d have to kill me. So I simply stood in front of the apparatus anchoring that creature in this world and dived out of the way when you fired. With its cage destroyed, the Resurrectionist was free to return to its own celestial plane.\nACE: (REALISING) Breaking your hold over reality!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid there’s no more reset button.\nCHIMBLY: Oh, swill.\nREVOLTING PROLES: Where are they?/Kill the pigs!/Down with Chimbly! [ETC]\nKEITH: (TO CHIMBLY) I told you, didn’t I? First time you killed him. Leave him dead, I said. He’ll only be trouble if you bring him back, I said. But oh no, you knew so much better, didn’t you? ‘Just imagine. It’1ll be so much fun having the Doctor in our power!’ Well, look at him now, you prawn, does he look like he’s in our power?\nCHIMBLY: I can still kill him properly. I’ve still got the gun.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure that’d be wise? I don’t think you’ve got the time. Listen.\nCHIMBLY: What’s that?\nCHIMBLY: Y.A.T.D. — #1: YOU ARE THE DOCTOR by John Dorney Page 47\nACE: At a guess, that’s a psychically subdued slave-force who’ve just realised they’re not psychically subdued any more.\nCHIMBLY: (TO KEITH) You know, Queen of my heart, I think this would be an opportune moment to beat a hasty retreat.\nKEITH: You took the words out of my mouth. Last one in the escape pod’s a rotting corpse.\nCHIMBLY: Oi! You can’t just run out on me! I — Alright, Doctor, I’1l1 get you next time! Don’t think I won’t. You’re a dead man. Keith! Keith! Wait for me!\nACE: You’re not going after them?\nDOCTOR: No, if the natives don’t catch them, I think leaving them together is punishment enough. Back to the TARDIS?\nACE: You’11l let me fly it again? You sure about that?\nDOCTOR: Like I said, nobody gets it right first time out. I’m willing to give you another chance. — What do you say, Ace?

You hadn’t replied to my invitation.\nDOCTOR: Lost in the post? Still, perhaps I can take a wild guess:\nNORRIS: Oh, I doubt it’ll be a guess, Doctor. I’m well aware that you are highly intelligent.\nDOCTOR: Interception by Timescoop!\nNORRIS: Bravo, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I recognised the effects. The ideal means for scooping up unsuspecting dinner guests, I suppose.\nNORRIS: (SIPS DRINK) Indeed it is, although the majority of my guests come of their own volition, in the hope of winning the game.\nMORECOMBE: Me, for example!\nDOCTOR: Is that right? Why exactly did you come here, Mr Morecombe?\nMORECOMBE: My employer sent me, Doctor. The company I work for has been keeping an eye on Mr Norris for some time now. They wish me to win the game on their behalf.\nDOCTOR: But what for? What’s the prize?!\nNORRIS: My library, of course. My collection.\nNORRIS: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 12\nNORRIS: SCENE 8: INT. THE KITCHEN\nNORRIS: FADE IN.\nACE: A game?! Sounds more like kidnapping to me!\nBRYER: My dear, I don’t think you realise how high the stakes are in Mister Norris’s game. — Tea?\nACE: No, thank you.\nBRYER: Mister Norris has found that men, and women, are willing to risk everything for the prize — whether they came here willingly, or by... alternative means.\nACE: Yeah, well, the Doctor’s not so stupid he’1l walk right into the lion’s mouth. Probably.\nBRYER: Don’t be so sure. My husband and I were his guests many years ago. But Daniel lost the game, so I lost Daniel.\nACE: Lost him? How?\nBRYER: After that, I refused to play. For some reason, Norris took pity on me. Although I suspect he took some pleasure in seeing me suffer. So he let me stay on as the housekeeper.\nACE: But why don’t you just leave? Surely you could run away, tell the authorities about what this Norris is up to?\nBRYER: Alas, not. There is no way off this planetoid, except for the Timescoop.\nACE: Timescoop? — Norris’ “alternative means”, you mean?\nBRYER: Yes. He keeps it in the conservatory. But I’m afraid I haven’t the faintest idea how to use it. Plus... I still live in hope.\nBRYER: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 13\nACE: Hope?! What are you hoping for?\nBRYER: I don’t know if it’s the truth, or if Norris is just taunting me, but he’s hinted — every now and again — that Daniel could somehow be brought back if Norris desired it.\nACE: And you can’t throw away that chance, I get it.\nBRYER: That’s the hope that I cling too. I must.\nACE: How long has Norris been playing this game?\nBRYER: Well, I’ve been here for a little over three years. We have twelve guests every weekend, So...\nACE: What?! That’s insane!\nBRYER: In fact, I’1ll tell you how many it is. We had a guest earlier this evening who was quite the human calculator — Ms Zingiber, a lovely girl! Anyway, she worked out that one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight lives have been lost here. Some of the greatest minds from across all time and space...\nACE: And Norris added her to the tally?\nBRYER: No, actually. Ms Zingiber was our first ever escapee.\nACE: So you can escape from here!\nBRYER: Only if you know how to operate the Timescoop. She watched Mr Norris do it. She must have memorised the commands, and then somehow reversed it all to make her escape. You would have liked her, my dear. In fact, you remind me of her, a little.\nBRYER: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 14\nBRYER: SCENE 9: INT. DINING ROOM\nNORRIS: The situation is quite straightforward. I have brought together a marvellous variety of dinner guests, only there’s a problem:\nDOCTOR: Let me guess: someone keeps killing them?\nNORRIS: Indeed, there is a murderer at large in this house. Each of my guests is given one chance to identify that murderer. When their turn comes, they will have five minutes to enter their answer into the library’s computer.\nDOCTOR: And if they’re wrong... the murderer comes for them.\nNORRIS: Goodness me, half-past eight already. Mister Morecombe, it’s your turn.\nMORECOMBE: My turn. Right.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Mister Morecombe — what’s so extraordinary about Mister Norris’s collection, that you’d play for such high stakes?\nMORECOMBE: Well, that’s obvious —\nNORRIS: Now, Doctor. You mustn’t go putting Mister Morecombe off.\nMORECOMBE: No, no. It’s just...\nNORRIS: What’s the matter, Morecombe? Earlier, you seemed so confident that you’d cracked it. Before the Doctor arrived.\nMORECOMBE: I am, yes. Quite confident! (HE’S NOT)\nNORRIS: You wouldn’t want to miss your turn, Mister Morecombe. If you did, and the Doctor won — why, your employers would be terribly upset.\nNORRIS: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page\nDOCTOR: I’m not playing, Norris.\nNORRIS: (REPROACHFULLY) Doctor. You’re playing now, I think.\nDOCTOR: Don’t listen to him, Mister Morecombe!\nMORECOMBE: It’s my turn. I must play!\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? Are you absolutely certain that you’ve solved the mystery?\nNORRIS: No conferring! — Please.\nMORECOMBE: Don’t worry, Mister Norris. I know the rules. Doctor — I’m so certain, I'd... I’d stake my life on it!\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to go, Mister Morecombe! In fact, I’d strongly advise against it!\nMORECOMBE: (OPENING DOOR) And let you take the prize? Do you take me for a fool?\nNORRIS: (CALLING AFTER) Goodbye, Mister Morecombe!\nDOCTOR: I get the feeling, Mister Norris, that there might be a slightly biased element to your ‘game’.\nNORRIS: Doctor, are you suggesting the game is rigged?\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily, but I’m not sure that you’re giving your guests a fair chance.\nDOCTOR: 15\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 16\nNORRIS: You'll get your turn soon enough. If I were you, Doctor, I’d begin to consider the problem of the murderer’s identity.\nDOCTOR: Well, the choices seem rather limited. Who lives in this house?\nNORRIS: I live here with my housekeeper, Mrs Bryer. That is all.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m sure the chances of winning this game are rather less than fifty-fifty.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 17\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10: INT. LIBRARY\nDOCTOR: SLAMS AND BOLT AUTOMATICALLY BEHIND HIM.\nMORECOMBE: (STARTLED) Ah! — Of course. Locked in. Pull yourself together, Morecombe.\nMORECOMBE: (STARTLED AGAIN) What’s that? — A countdown? (CALLING) Is that your idea, Mister Norris? Counting down five minutes, to add to the peril? (TO SELF) Of course it is.\nMORECOMBE: Come on. You know the answer. Only one possible answer. Just type it into the terminal. (SCOFFING) Five minutes. (CALLING) Five minutes?! As if I’d need five minutes!\nMORECOMBE: This is it. And the winning answer, for the prize, the promotion and the raise, is...\nMORECOMBE: And — enter.\nMORECOMBE: Wrong?! How is that possible?!\nMORECOMBE: No! Please no!\nTORTURED SOULS: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 18\nTORTURED SOULS: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 19\nTORTURED SOULS: SCENE 11: INT. KITCHEN\nACE: What was that?! Another murder?\nBRYER: Yes, I’m afraid so. Poor Mister Morecombe.\nACE: That was from the library. No question! Well, I’ve had enough of doing nothing.\nBRYER: Please, Ace. You can’t go in the library.\nACE: “Do not. Go into. The library.” Creepy old woman, just get out of my way!\nBRYER: It’s for your own good.\nACE: Something’s not right about all this. There’s something you’re not telling me!\nBRYER: I’ve told you — (HESITANT) I’ve told you as much as I dare.\nACE: Then I’1l have to find out for myself. (EFFORT AS SHE SHOVES\nBRYER: ASIDE)\nBRYER: (SHOVED) Ahh!\nBRYER: Wait! Please...!\nBRYER: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 20\nBRYER: SCENE 12: INT. DINING ROOM\nDOCTOR: You knew Morecombe would get it wrong — didn’t you, Norris?\nNORRIS: I’ve seen hundreds come and go from this dining table, Doctor. Most of them think they’ve solved the mystery — by deduction, by instinct, perhaps by an overwhelming belief in their own good fortune. But no-one ever has.\nDOCTOR: Like lambs to the slaughter.\nNORRIS: I see you, Doctor. Thinking. Calculating. Cogitating. Trying to work it out. Not long now, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I told you: I’m not playing.\nNORRIS: Oh, Doctor. (HEAVY HINT) I can read you like a book.\nDOCTOR: Or you’re hoping you’1l be able to, perhaps...?\nNORRIS: Very good, Doctor! You have been paying attention!\nDOCTOR: I’m right, then. Just one question though, Norris: what’s to stop me leaving in my TARDIS right now?\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 21\nDOCTOR: SCENE 13: INT. HALLWAY/LIBRARY\nACE: Here goes nothing —\nBRYER: (OFF, RUNNING UP) Ace! Please, you mustn’t-!\nACE: Not interested!\nACE: OK, space lectern. What is it with that...?\nACE: What the...?!\nBRYER: (BEHIND DOOR, IN HALLWAY) Oh, Ace! I told you not to go into the library!\nACE: Door knob won’t budge. — Have you locked me in here?!\nBRYER: (BEHIND DOOR) The room seals up automatically!\nACE: Now you tell me!\nACE: Hold on — what’s that noise...?\nBRYER: (BEHIND DOOR; PANICKING) Stay calm, Ace!\nACE: I am calm! (SUSPICION) Why aren’t you...?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR, IN LIBRARY) I said, why aren’t you calm?!\nBRYER: Try not to panic. I’1ll fetch Mister Norris!\nACE: Never mind him, fetch the Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: (ARRIVING) I’m already here.\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR) Doctor? Is that you? Doctor, I’m locked in!\nNORRIS: Dear me, Doctor. So you weren’t unaccompanied. I warned Mrs Bryer you might not be.\nDOCTOR: Oh, the housekeeper. (TO BRYER) Hello.\nACE: Stop chit-chatting and let me out of here!!!\nNORRIS: Alas, it seems your young companion is going to have to play the game, too.\nDOCTOR: Let her out of there! Now!\nNORRIS: I can’t do that, Doctor. The whole process is automated from this point. I can no more let her out than I can let you in. (FAUX SINCERITY) There’s really nothing I can do.\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR) Doctor, there’s this noise. I think it’s a countdown!\nNORRIS: Well, yes. It all adds to the peril.\nDOCTOR: Ace! Look on the memorialiser panel!\nDOCTOR: Page 22\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 23\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR) On the what?!\nDOCTOR: On the ‘space lectern’! There should be a display!\nACE: BEAT.\nDOCTOR: Ace? What does it say?\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR; RETURNING) Three point four two, three point four one... it’s minutes, isn’t it?\nNORRIS: Oh, yes.\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR) Minutes ‘til what? Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: Timescoop. (BEAT) Mrs Bryer! Where’s the timescoop?\nBRYER: [It’s—]\nNORRIS: (SIMULTANEOUSLY) Don’t tell him!\nACE: (BEHIND DOOR) Oh, oh! She said! The conservatory!\nNORRIS: (REPROACHFULLY) Mrs Bryer..!\nBRYER: I’m sorry, Mister Norris...\nDOCTOR: Beside the drawing-room we landed in, I suppose?\nBRYER: Erv...\nBRYER: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 24\nDOCTOR: Your hesitation speaks volumes.

DOCTOR HARES INSIDE, BRUSHING PAST FOLIAGE.\nDOCTOR: There you are! Norris’ Timescoop. Quite a smart model too! (STOPS) Now, let’s see if I can remember how to do this. It should be like falling off a bike...\nDOCTOR: Adjust the chronophore trim here... reverse the polarity of the\nDOCTOR: whatsit here...\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 26\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15: INT. LIBRARY\nACE: Doctor...!!! (LOSING HOPE) Oh, what’s keeping you...?\nDOCTOR: And as if by magic...\nACE: Doctor! (BEAT) Naah, that wasn’t magic — was it?\nDOCTOR: Close-proximity spatial displacement, courtesy of Norris’ timescoop.\nACE: Ace! (BEAT) But couldn’t you have just scooped me out of here?\nDOCTOR: That would have been too easy. (CROSSING TO MEMORIALISER) We’ve got to shut this machine down!\nACE: What did you say it was? A ‘memorialiser’?\nDOCTOR: An Aeorian Memorialiser [PRONOUNCIATION: ‘A-YOUR-IAN’]. A machine designed to consume the consciousnesses of the deceased, preserving their knowledge for all eternity.\nACE: That doesn’t sound so terrible.\nDOCTOR: It condenses the dear departed in the process, transforming their carbonised remains into a physical record.\nACE: Like the book on the lectern, you mean? (READING TITLE) “Morecombe Unwise: A Short Life.” Who’s Morecombe Unwise?\nDOCTOR: Just another volume to add to Mister Norris’s library. You see: the Memorialiser was never designed to be used on human subjects.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 27\nACE: Err, Doctor — we’re down to two minutes. Hadn’t you better turn that thing off, before we get paperbacked?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. The question is: who’s the murderer?\nACE: You don’t actually know how to turn it off, do you?\nDOCTOR: Of course I do! Input the name of the killer, and the condensing program will be aborted.\nACE: I knew it! You’re playing Norris’s game!\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 28\nACE: SCENE 16: INT. DINING ROOM\nBRYER: Edwin, I...\nNORRIS: Too familiar, Mrs Bryer! (BEAT) You really are trying to incur my displeasure this evening, aren’t you? What was your intention? To persuade the Doctor’s companion to operate the Timescoop for you? Ha!\nBRYER: I’m so sorry, Mr Norris. I didn’t [mean to]...\nNORRIS: No matter. Despite your.. error of judgement, it’s all gone rather swimmingly.

Think! What are the typical murder mystery solutions?\nACE: Errr.. Norris has a twin?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s just him and Bryer in the house.\nACE: They both did it?\nDOCTOR: Norris and Bryer together? No — each was with us while poor Mr Morecombe made his unwise decision.\nACE: Hang on. Maybe they all did it?\nDOCTOR: Elaborate, Ace.\nACE: Well, if this memorial-whatsit extracts people’s knowledge, or whatever...\nDOCTOR: YessSs...?\nACE: What happens to their tortured, angry souls?\nDOCTOR: Ace, that’s hardly scientific!\nACE: Thing is, when I peeked inside here earlier, I could have sworn I heard a sort of anguished groaning...\nACE: Yeah, like that!\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson\nTORTURED SOULS: (ANOTHER MOAN, AND ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER — CONTINUING TO\nCOAGULATE: AROUND THE DOCTOR AND ACE THROUGH: )\nDOCTOR: Excess psycho-electrical energies, of course!

The machine that’s doing the killing!\nACE: So the guests Norris has knocked off are the murderers...\nDOCTOR: And the murder weapon too!\nACE: Right, then — how do we put that answer into the computer? We can’t put all the names in — there must be hundreds of books. And we’ve got less than a minute! (BEAT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Got it! We copy the full memorialiser log into the terminal.\nACE: Do it, then!\nDOCTOR: Done. Ready to confirm?\nACE: Wait! Is Morecombe on that list?\nDOCTOR: (CHECKING) Errr — yes. Why?\nACE: Well, he hasn’t done anyone in yet. Has he?\nDOCTOR: Good thinking, Ace. Deleting Morecombe’s record, now...\nDOCTOR: Page 30\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 31\nDOCTOR: This is it! — Ready?\nACE: Just promise me, if we’re wrong: I won’t come back as something trashy, with metallic foil on the front?\nCROSS TO: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 32\nCROSS TO: SCENE 18: INT.

There you are.\nNORRIS: (SPLUTTERS ON MINE) What?! But [how]\nACE: Turns out you’re not as smart as you think, mate.\nNORRIS: (CALLING) Mrs Bryer! Fetch my pistols!!!\nDOCTOR: An interesting twist on the traditional murder mystery evening — making your murderees your murderers.\nACE: ‘Twisted’ is right!\nNORRIS: Thank you for your fascinating analysis, young lady.\nACE: Spare us the sarcasm, mate. We won your stupid game. Now we get to claim the prize — isn’t that right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Only we don’t want it.\nACE: We don’t?\nDOCTOR: We have a not inconsiderable library of our own, in the TARDIS. The last thing we need is more books.\nACE: Fair point. — So what do we want?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 33\nBRYER: (ARRIVING) You called, Sir?\nNORRIS: Ah, the pistols. Good. Escort the Doctor and Ace back to the library, would you?\nACE: Yeah, she’s not gonna help you. She hates you just as much as everyone else here does.\nNORRIS: Ah, but I can bring Daniel back.\nDOCTOR: Daniel?\nACE: Her husband. — Think about it, Mrs Bryer. He’s just stringing you along. He can no more bring Daniel back than I can grow wings. He doesn’t know how.\nNORRIS: Perfectly correct, my dear.\nBRYER: What?\nNORRIS: I don’t know how to bring Daniel back. I don’t know how to bring any of them back. All I ever wanted was to collect the greatest intellects in the galaxy.\nDOCTOR: But why, Norris? What was it for???\nNORRIS: (LOSING THE PLOT) So I’d be the smartest, of course!\nACE: All this was to eliminate the competition?\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nACE: He’s a complete nutjob!\nDOCTOR: Again...\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 34\nNORRIS: You’re going in my library, both of you. Mrs Bryer, lead them in!\nBRYER: But — you can’t bring Daniel back...!\nNORRIS: I can’t, you stupid woman! But the Doctor can!\nACE: Eh?\nNORRIS: He thinks he knows everything! Of course he knows how to bring Daniel back! So put that knowledge in my library!\nACE: The Doctor can’t bring the dead back to life!\nDOCTOR: Well...\nNORRIS: See?! See?!?\nDOCTOR: I could leach the excess electrical energies from the machine,\nDOCTOR: yes. But I’m not going to.\nBRYER: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because the dead should stay dead, Mrs Bryer. I’m sorry.\nACE: In an ideal world, yeah, but under the circumstances...\nNORRIS: Take them through, Mrs Bryer!\nBRYER: Doctor, Ace — move!!!\nBRYER: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 35\nBRYER: SCENE 19.

Doctor. “Ace”.\nACE: Mrs Bryer, think about this!\nBRYER: If the Doctor won’t bring Daniel back, then I’ve no choice.\nDOCTOR: Do as he says, Ace.\nNORRIS: Excellent!\nBRYER: You too, Norris.\nNORRIS: What?!\nBRYER: (SHOVING HIM) I said, you too!\nNORRIS: (SHOVED INTO LIBRARY) Oof!\nNORRIS: Mrs Bryer. Mrs Bryer!!!\nACE: Here we are again. Back in the frying pan. Least we know what to do.\nDOCTOR: I won, Ace. But I refused to take possession of the machine, when it was offered.\nNORRIS: So it’s still mine to control!\nDOCTOR: No, now it’s possessed itself.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 36\nDOCTOR: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: Now we shall possess you...!\nACE: Uh-oh...\nACE: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: With the Doctor’s knowledge, we shall be complete! The greatest library in the galaxy!\nACE: Is it just me, or is everyone here completely insane?\nDOCTOR: It’s the machine that made them mad. That’s why I can’t bring anyone back.\nNORRIS: Doctor, I beg you — do something! There’s still three minutes and forty-eight seconds on the clock!\nNORRIS: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: The countdown was only ever for effect. Now we will take our revenge — on you, Mister Norris!\nNORRIS: What? No — no!!! (SCREAMS AS...)\nNORRIS: SUDDENLY.\nACE: He’s vanished!\nDOCTOR: Condensed. (FX: FLICKS PAGES) Brought to book, you might say. What a disappointingly slim volume.\nDOCTOR: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: Now, Doctor. Now we shall absorb you...!\nDOCTOR: Yes, but why?\nDOCTOR: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: Just... because.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 37\nDOCTOR: That’s not a good enough reason!\nACE: I told you. — Doctor, think of something!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid our fate is no longer in our own hands. The machine will have to power itself down from the inside. (CALLING) Mister Norris! Are you still in there?!\nNORRIS: (GHOSTLY) Doctor? Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: You can still do it. Delete the full memorialiser log!\nNORRIS: (GHOSTLY) Why should I?\nACE: Because otherwise, they’1ll have outsmarted you! All of them!\nACE: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS:\nDOCTOR: Hear that, Norris? They’re laughing at you!\nNORRIS: (GHOSTLY) Laughing? At me? Well, I’11l show thenm...!\nNORRIS: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: Norris, no!\nNORRIS: (GHOSTLY) Copy, paste — and enter!\nNORRIS: MORECOMBE/OTHER TORTURED SOULS: Noooo—\nBOLTS: UNLOCK.\nACE: Is that it?\nDOCTOR: The ghosts have been exorcised from the machine. It’s over.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 38\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20: INT. PARLOUR\nBRYER: They were mad, of course. All of them. I see that now. But while there was the slightest chance, I had to take it — don’t you see?\nACE: I didn’t mind making the tea, but I’m not sure I’ve got any sympathy.\nDOCTOR: And very good tea it is too, Ace. I think we can afford to be magnanimous, don’t you?\nACE: I guess.\nDOCTOR: The question is, Mrs Bryer — what will you do with the Library?\nBRYER: The Library?\nDOCTOR: The hard copies survive, Mrs Bryer. It’s still a very fine collection. All that knowledge and experience mustn’t go to waste.\nBRYER: I... I suppose...\nDOCTOR: In time, the Daniel Bryer Memorial Library might be as famous as.. as, well, the Great Library of Alexandria!\nBRYER: Do you really think so?\nDOCTOR: I know so.\nACE: Only you might want to categorise everything properly first?\nBRYER: I don’t understand.\nACE: Doctor, you still got Norris’s book?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #2: COME DIE WITH ME by Jamie Anderson Page 39\nDOCTOR: I do, yes.

The next one of you that makes a noise will end as dead as the housekeeper. Understand?\nKORDEL: Yeah, heroics were way above her pay scale, too.\nKORDEL: What now?\nKORDEL: (CLEARS THROAT, ALL CHARM) Good afternoon, room service?\nKORDEL: Oh, Reception, thanks for calling...\nKORDEL: The security alarm? A malfunction, nothing serious.\nKORDEL: No, a patrol won’t be necessary. Just a minor fluid spillage on\nKORDEL: the control terminal. I have a technician working on it.\nKORDEL: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 9\nKORDEL: No, we wouldn’t want the guests complaining. We’1ll have the issue resolved shortly.\nKORDEL: (IMPATIENT) Get a move on, Ruben.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 10\nCUT TO: SCENE 5: INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR\nCUT TO: PANEL. OCCASIONAL SPARKS FIZZ.\nRUBEN: (CLOSE. MUTTERING IMPATIENTLY) Stupid system. Why won’t you shut down?\nACE: (DISTANT — SHOUTS) Oi, mate!\nRUBEN: OUCH!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Excuse my young friend’s manners. New chambermaid, just started today — I’m giving her “the tour”. (CONSPIRATORIALLY) Between you and me, I’m not sure she’s got what it takes.\nACE: Hey!\nDOCTOR: Do you need some assistance?\nDOCTOR: Let me take a look. It’s really not the most pleasant of noises, a security alarm.\nACE: That’s the point, isn’t it? To be “alarming”.\nDOCTOR: Maybe I’ve set off too many in my time. They’ve lost their novelty value. What do you think, Ace — the red or the blue wire?\nACE: Oh, the red. It’s always the red, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Or it could be this grey one. Let’s go grey. Happens to us all eventually. Or previously.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 11\nDOCTOR: There.\nCORRIDOR: ATMOS. AN UNEASY MOMENT.\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you’d be kind enough to show us to the nearest exit, would you?\nRUBEN: But weren’t you..? — I mean, yes, you’d probably better follow\nRUBEN: me.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 12\nCUT TO: SCENE 6: INT. COURT OF JUSTICE\nCHAFAL: And you claim this was your first encounter with Suspect A303, the Soror native Ruben?\nACE: Why should I go to the effort of making stuff up? I thought that was your job?\nCHAFAL: Only, your companion seemed to know so much about the hotel’s security system.\nACE: The Doctor knew a lot of things.\nCHAFAL: One wonders how much you ever really knew about him?\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 13\nCUT TO: SCENE 7: INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR\nRUBEN: (AHEAD OF THE OTHERS) It’s not far. I just have to report back to my, um, line manager.\nRUBEN: THE DOCTOR AND ACE TALK CONSPIRATORIALLY.\nACE: Is it just me, or does Mister Short and Hairy seem a bit shifty?\nDOCTOR: Never judge a book by its cover, Ace — unless that book’s called “Tampering with Security Systems for Dummies”.\nACE: So that’s how you know so much about them!\nDOCTOR: This chap’s a low-level porter, going by the uniform. I don’t imagine he has clearance to operate a paper cup dispenser, let alone fix an alarm.\nRUBEN: (NEARBY, STAMMERS) Here we are. Just through here.\nACE: (WHISPERS) Whatever it is he’s up to, I think we’re about to find out.\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 14\nACE: SCENE 8: INT. ROOM SERVICE CONTROL [CONTINUOUS]\nKORDEL: Finally. What took you?\nRUBEN: (ENTERS) I’m sorry, Kordel. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t —\nRUBEN: THE DOCTOR AND ACE ENTER.\nDOCTOR: Room Service, I presume? I wanted to talk to someone about the towels...\nACE: (ALARMED) Professor.\nDOCTOR: Ah. A Pulz—-Kannon, I believe? Kannon with a ‘K’.\nKORDEL: (SHOUTS) Hold it. Hands behind your heads. On your knees. NOW. (TO RUBEN) What were you playing at, Ruben?\nRUBEN: They found me at the alarm interface. I couldn’t just let them walk away. What if they’re Security?\nKORDEL: Do they look like Security? Go find a rope or something and get them tied up. (BEAT) Well, go on!\nRUBEN: Right. Yes...\nACE: (WHISPERS) Suddenly dirty linen doesn’t seem so bad. Who’d stick up a hotel laundry?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERS) Someone who wants to make a clean getaway?\nKORDEL: (ORDERS) Stop talking.\nDOCTOR: I think there’s been something of a misunderstanding.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page\nKORDEL: I said stop.\nDOCTOR: You do realise it was us who shut down the alarm, don’t you?\nKORDEL: You?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid your friend seemed rather out of his depth.\nACE: This place would be swarming with hotel security by now, if we hadn’t helped him.\nKORDEL: I’ve already dealt with our security issue. We’re in the clear. Question is — who are you?\nDOCTOR: Do I have to spell it out? We’re part of the gang, not casual passers-by. You’re evidently the muscle, he’s the inside man, and we’re.. I.T. support.\nKORDEL: You look pretty casual to me. I wasn’t told anyone else was on this job.\nDOCTOR: You’re on a Need-to-Know basis, and you didn’t need to know until you needed to know, which was when the alarm bells started ringing.\nACE: Think of us as Plan B.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. — So you might want to point that Kannon with a K at something less susceptible to death by plasma fire...?\nRUBEN: (PANTING) All I could find was this old shower curtain and some soap on a rope.\nKORDEL: Keep them. Seems we’re all in this together.\nKORDEL: 15\nKORDEL: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 16\nKORDEL: SCENE 9: INT. COURT OF JUSTICE\nCHAFAL: So, you admit that you and your accomplice were involved after all?\nACE: We were bluffing. She had a gun on us. It was a strategy — confuse the enemy, get them on-side?\nCHAFAL: A simpler explanation would be that you were not only involved but complicit.\nACE: Kordel was obviously dangerous, so we improvised! We had no idea what was going on in there.\nCHAFAL: Are you quite sure about that?\nACE: I told you what happened!\nCHAFAL: And were you aware that the Doctor had been known to the Soror authorities for some time?\nACE: He got around.\nCHAFAL: As the police records show.\nCHAFAL: AS THE CLIPS PLAY OUT.\nCHAFAL: LASER-FIRE, SCREAMS.\nCHAFAL: Here. The social unrest on Soror B that resulted in the unavoidable execution of twenty-two civilians. There’s your Doctor, ringleader of a criminal mob.\nCHAFAL: EXPLOSION.\nCHAFAL: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 17\nCHAFAL: Here. The destruction of Soror’s primary nutrient factory. The Doctor can be seen fleeing the facility shortly before the explosion.\nBIGGER: EXPLOSION.\nCHAFAL: And again...\nEXPLOSION: STILL.\nCHAFAL: And again. These are not the actions of a man who merely blunders into situations. I put it to you that you knew exactly what you were getting into, and that you and the Doctor were on a mission. A mission to overthrow the Soror Dictat!\nACE: That’s ridiculous!\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 18\nCUT TO: SCENE 10: INT. ROOM SERVICE CONTROL\nDOCTOR: Now we’re all friends, how about some introductions? Criminal aliases, obviously. I’m the Doctor, AKA the Professor, AKA The Approaching Inclement Weather System — although I admit that last one is a work in progress.\nACE: Yeah, and I’m Ace, his... Hench-Person?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure our reputations precede us.\nKORDEL: They don’t. Just because you cut the alarm doesn’t mean security won’t be on our case eventually. We need to hustle. So, I.T. Helpdesk — what’s your plan B?\nDOCTOR: I was rather hoping you’d tell us.\nACE: That’s the problem with Need-to-Know. We don’t.\nKORDEL: Some support!\nDOCTOR: This location must have been chosen for a reason. Out of the way, unimportant, a soft target. But why?\nRUBEN: Room Service has a portal to the hotel’s Vault Conduit. With the correct pass-code, it enables unrestricted access to every portal on the network, even the secure ones. I.. used to work here, that’s how I know. But...\nDOCTOR: A Vault Conduit. A conduit.. A device for conveying matter from A to... Oh!\nACE: What?\nDOCTOR: Some of the wealthiest and shadiest guests in the entire galaxy frequent the Grand Betelgeuse Hotel, every one of them with “baggage” they’d prefer to keep locked away, somewhere totally secure.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 19\nACE: The vault at the other end of the Vault Conduit...\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The safest safety deposit box in this or any other universe — which happens to be just beyond the event horizon of the hotel’s tame black hole.\nACE: Awesome. Beats stuffing bank notes under a mattress.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. unless some nefarious ne’er-do-wells — no offence — get their hands on the pass-code, then you might as well have stayed in bed.\nKORDEL: Stop telling me what I already know and open the conduit. That’s what you’re being paid for, right?\nDOCTOR: You’re our man in Havana, Ruben. The code is your area of expertise.\nRUBEN: . What?\nDOCTOR: The pass-code?\nRUBEN: Oh. Erm...\nKORDEL: You do have the code, don’t you?\nRUBEN: I stole it when I was let go... but it doesn’t work. I found out just when the housekeeper...\nKORDEL: (ANGRY) I knew you’d turn out to be a useless asset, you Sororian waste of molecules.\nRUBEN: (UPSET) It’s not my fault. They must have changed it. And you’d better stop talking to me like that, or you’1ll be sorry!\nKORDEL: Not nearly as sorry as you’re about to be.\nKORDEL: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 20\nRUBEN: (SQUEALS) But...\nDOCTOR: (COMMANDING) NO. No more killing. If you pull that trigger, I’m not opening anything.\nKORDEL: (DISGUSTED) Ugh.\nDOCTOR: There. Doesn’t that feel better?\nKORDEL: Not particularly.\nDOCTOR: I’1l have to work around the missing code, but it shouldn’t take long to knock up a bypass circuit. Ace, take Ruben and find the staff room. We could all do with a stiff drink. Tea, milk and half-a-dozen sugars please.\nACE: I’m not really a trainee chambermaid, you know.\nDOCTOR: (GROWLS UNDER HIS BREATH) I know. Just get Ruben away from her — and try to find out what it is we’re supposed to be stealing.\nCROSSFADE TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 21\nCROSSFADE TO: SCENE 11: INT. STAFF ROOM\nATMOS: A SMALL ROOM.\nATMOS: DISPENSER.\nRUBEN: (PERTURBED, NOT REALLY SPEAKING TO ACE) She can’t speak to me like that. How was I supposed to know the code had changed ...?\nACE: Here. Drink this... whatever this is.\nRUBEN: It’s all going wrong. I don’t know what to do.\nACE: The Doctor will make it right. He’s broken into way more places than I have, and I grew up in Perivale.\nRUBEN: (SIPS DRINK AND SNORTS CONTEMPTUOUSLY) You humans are all the same. Duplicitous, greedy, criminal monsters.\nACE: We’re not all the same. If it’s monsters you want, think yourself lucky we’re not Cybermen, or worse.\nRUBEN: DOESN’T RESPOND. ACE TRIES AGAIN.\nACE: You must have been pretty desperate, Ruben. To come back like this, after they’d.. they fired you, right?\nRUBEN: It happens. Sororian labour is cheap and easy to come by. Career prospects are not something we give much consideration too. So long as we can feed our families.\nACE: If this place is worth as much as the Doctor says, they’1ll feed pretty well.\nRUBEN: It is worth nothing.\nACE: So if it’s not about the money, what are you after? Revenge?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 22\nRUBEN: That’s what you think this is about? Something that petty? You think we’re so small-minded?\nACE: No. It’s just, you don’t seem like much of a criminal.\nRUBEN: I’m nothing like that witch out there. Or you and your bizarre companion. Thugs, thieves and vagrants.\nACE: The Doctor saved your life, remember?\nRUBEN: What good is being alive if I’ve already failed my people? My family?\nRUBEN: STANDS AND WALKS OUT.\nACE: Ruben, wait! (BEAT, TO HERSELF) Sorry, Professor. I tried.\nACE: FOLLOWS RUBEN.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 23\nCUT TO: SCENE 12: INT. ROOM SERVICE CONTROL\nKORDEL: I’ve sealed the entrances. Security will be onto us the second the conduit is activated. Should keep them off our backs until we’re gone. Are you done yet, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (WORKING AWAY ON A CIRCUIT) Almost there...\nKORDEL: We’re running out of time. Just need to add a little extra insurance policy...\nKORDEL: CONSOLE, BLEEPS SIGNIFY IT HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.\nDOCTOR: A thermic detonator?\nKORDEL: It’ll trigger automatically once we’re on the other side. I don’t want anyone following us.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t blowing up the portal make this rather a one-way trip?\nKORDEL: I never take on a job without an extraction plan.\nDOCTOR: I prefer to make things up as I go along.\nKORDEL: Why doesn’t that surprise me?\nDOCTOR: Can I ask — why Ruben? What did you promise him? I can’t help feeling he was hoping to get rather more out of this than money.\nKORDEL: We needed an ex-employee who could gain us easy access to the conduit. He was so keen, it was as if the servile mongrel couldn’t wait to find a way back into the hotel.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating...\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 24\nKORDEL: Still, without the code, he’s excess baggage. We’ll be leaving\nKORDEL: him here.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 25\nCUT TO: SCENE 13: INT. STAFF ROOM CORRIDOR\nACE: Ruben?\nRUBEN: (COMPOSES HIMSELF) Keep away from me.\nACE: I’m trying to understand. What is it you have to do? The Doctor and me, maybe we can help.\nRUBEN: (INTERUPTS) I don’t need your help, or anyone else’s. This is something I have to do.\nACE: Look - we’re not really part of any gang. Whatever Kordel is here to steal, believe me, we have nothing to do with it.\nRUBEN: I stopped believing human lies the day they took my children.\nACE: Your kids? I’m so sorry. Who would do that? Why?\nRUBEN: (CYNICAL) The “Grand” Betelgeuse Hotel has a high staff turnover. They take what they need. If the guests only knew the suffering and torment my people endure so that they have a “pleasant stay”.\nACE: Can’t you go to the authorities? Tell them what’s happening?\nRUBEN: The hotel is “the authorities”. The Soror Dictat controls everything — the solar farms, the furnaces, even the dessert menu — all in the service of hospitality.\nACE: So if the hotel is just another branch of the state, then... That’s why you’re working with Kordel — You want to use the conduit to find your kids!\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 26\nRUBEN: (DARKLY) Something like that.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 27\nCUT TO: SCENE 14: INT. ROOM SERVICE CONTROL\nDOCTOR: Who needs a secret access code when there’s a Doctor in the house?\nKORDEL: Are we good to go?\nDOCTOR: More or less, once Ace and Ruben get back.\nDOCTOR: Talk of the devil... No tea?\nACE: Just a kind of gloopy soup. Not really your sort of thing.\nDOCTOR: Shame. A cup of tea helps no end before a spot of inter- dimensional matter transferal. Where’s Ruben?\nACE: He’s.. he’1l be here in a bit. He just needs a little time.\nDOCTOR: There isn’t any. We’re ready.\nKORDEL: Not so fast.\nKORDEL: Get over there. You’re not coming.\nKORDEL: ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF KORDEL TO ACE AND THE DOCTOR].\nRUBEN: What’s going on?\nKORDEL: I’m putting this plan back on track. Anyone but me going through the portal was never part of it.\nRUBEN: (DISTRAUGHT, SHOUTS) You lied to me!\nRUBEN: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 28\nKORDEL: That’s rich, coming from you!\nRUBEN: NO! (SCREAMS — LIKE AN ANGRY CHIMPANZEE)\nRUBEN: LEAPS AT KORDEL, AND THEY STRUGGLE.\nDOCTOR: Ruben! No!\nKORDEL: STRUGGLES FOR BREATH AS RUBEN ATTEMPTS TO THROTTLE HER.\nKORDEL: Achhkkkkk...! Get... this... animal... off me!\nACE: Watch out, Professor. The gun!\nLARGE: OBJECT — KORDEL’S CORPSE — SLAMS INTO THE GROUND.\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 29\nCUT TO: SCENE 15: INT. COURT OF JUSTICE\nCHAFAL: When our security team gained access to Room Service Control, you were found with two corpses, burnt beyond all recognition.\nACE: The Doctor. He didn’t stand a chance...\nCHAFAL: (CHUCKLES) Convincing, but impossible. One was the housekeeper. The autopsy confirmed that the other was female. Are you implying your accomplice somehow changed gender, mid-robbery?\nACE: OK, Judge Judy — it was Kordel. Ruben got hold of her blaster in the struggle and... well, blasted her.\nCHAFAL: You expect me to believe an ex-hotel porter, a Sororian, knew how to fire an advanced energy weapon?\nACE: It’s not difficult. All you have to do is pull the trigger. Give me a gun and I’1l prove it, if you like?\nCHAFAL: That won’t be necessary. It is well known that Sororians are incapable of anything more than rudimentary menial tasks.\nACE: You’re wrong. You treat them like animals, yet you’re surprised when they fight back?\nCHAFAL: The facts are not up for debate. You and the Doctor conspired to murder your accomplices, to take their share of your ill- gotten gains.\nACE: You’re an idiot.\nCHAFAL: We have a murder weapon, two victims, one suspect, and the testimony of several hostages.\nACE: Who were locked up in a storage cabinet. They didn’t see anything! Don’t you even want to know what happened to the others?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 30\nCHAFAL: Is your guilt not proven? Or do their deaths weigh heavily on your conscience too?\nCUT TO: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 31\nCUT TO: SCENE 16: INT. ROOM SERVICE CONTROL\nACE: Kordel’s dead.\nRUBEN: (CATCHING BREATH) You, Doctor. You were working on a way to open the Vault Conduit, bypassing the security protocols?\nDOCTOR: I was.\nRUBEN: Do it now, (FX: PULZ-KANNON COCKED) or your hench-person dies too.\nACE: There’s no need for this, Ruben. Once the Doctor knows what they did to your family...\nRUBEN: Do it!\nDOCTOR: Conduit active. Everybody, into the portal.\nRUBEN: No. Now, Doctor — activate every other portal in the network, on both sides of the black hole.\nDOCTOR: Both sides? But —\nRUBEN: Never mind. I’ve been watching, I can do it myself.\nRUBEN: STARTS ALTERING SETTINGS ON THE PORTAL CONTROL TERMINAL.\nDOCTOR: Ruben, think about this!\nDOCTOR: PITCH AND VOLUME THROUGHOUT THE SCENE.\nACE: (TO DOCTOR) What’s he doing, Doctor? What happens if he activates every portal in the network? Something bad, right?\nDOCTOR: Extremely.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 32\nVOICES: RAISED ABOVE THE GROWING DIN.\nDOCTOR: Ruben, you’re about to flood a planet-wide transmat system with unfiltered anti-matter. Do you have any idea what that means?\nRUBEN: Freedom!\nDOCTOR: The total destruction of your planet. Your people. Every one of them will die.\nRUBEN: Your Earth Empire began that process long ago.\nACE: But your kids...!\nRUBEN: (DISTRAUGHT) The Dictat stole them from me. If they’re not dead already, there’s no chance I'll ever find them. Now I’m taking everything back, for Soror!\nACE: This isn’t the way!\nDOCTOR: What if your children are still alive? The hotel will have kept records, left a paper trail. I can help you follow it.\nACE: We can help you find them, Ruben. Please! You owe it to them to try!\nRUBEN: (REALISATION) I... oh my.. what have I done?\nSTILL: INCREASES.\nRUBEN: (SOBBING) I can’t stop it. I can’t stop it!\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING) It’s too late.

Perhaps that was the reason he tolerated your companionship, all along.\nACE: He died saving your planet. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?\nCHAFAL: He was part of a pre-meditated attack against the Dictat. You admitted as much yourself.\nACE: I’ve told you what happened. Have you got cloth ears or something?\nCHAFAL: You and your associates have been found guilty as charged. As their legal status is deceased, their sentences will be commuted onto yours.

You beamed me out of the dispersal chamber!\nDOCTOR: A little theatrical, but so far as the court knows, your atoms have been utterly discombobulated.\nACE: There was an explosion. Back in Room Service Control. I thought...\nDOCTOR: Kordel had installed a thermic detonator to explode when the portal was used, so using it was the quickest way to stop everything else going bang. That’s why I told you to take cover.\nACE: You could have told me!\nDOCTOR: Ah, but thanks to your testimony, mine and Ruben’s legal status is ‘deceased’.\nACE: Great, so you used me.\nDOCTOR: It afforded me a wonderful opportunity. I was right about the hotel records. I found Ruben’s family.\nACE: What about Ruben? How is he?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #3: THE GRAND BETELGEUSE HOTEL by Christopher Cooper Page 39\nDOCTOR: Resting. I know a Venusian litany that works wonders to soothe a troubled mind. He was right, though: his people need our help.\nACE: Too right. They showed me holograms, in the courtroom. You were helping the Sororian rebels.\nDOCTOR: Really? Well I wasn’t, yet. That’s the problem with time travel — sometimes the future overtakes you. This hotel needs new management.\nACE: Well, it’s the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in.

I know how that must sound.\nDOCTOR: I wonder if you do, Miss Quince.\nCYNTHIA: Cynthia.\nDOCTOR: Cynthia.\nCYNTHIA: Up until yesterday, I was still in hysterics. I suppose I’ve just come out the other side of it, you know, accepted things.\nDOCTOR: What things, precisely?\nDOCTOR: Page 3\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 4\nCYNTHIA: That I was going to go the same way as everyone else, you know — liquefy. That’s a funny word, isn’t, liquefy?\nDOCTOR: It’s not one of my favourites. What’s causing it, Cynthia?\nCYNTHIA: You tell me. You’re the doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but I, uh, need more information before I can make a diagnosis. Prognosis. No, diagnosis. I think.\nCYNTHIA: Adriana must’ve told you what happened. Captain Beauvais, I mean. Mervyn and me, we call her Adriana now. When you’re stuck together like this and you don’t know who’s going next, you don’t bother with titles. So what do I call you?\nDOCTOR: Doctor. What’s this ship’s course, Cynthia? Where were you headed?\nCYNTHIA: There and back again. After I had the accident, I thought- why not?\nDOCTOR: Why not, indeed? (BEAT) I’m sorry, what accident?\nCYNTHIA: Three years ago, I was walking to work, went past a building site, this bloke on the scaffolding drops his hammer... (WHISTLES, FOLLOWED BY A SPLAT SOUND). The surgery I had! Tap my forehead. Go on.\nDOCTOR: Good grief.\nCYNTHIA: That’s titanium, that is. Doesn’t half give me a migraine when it rains. I’m lucky to be alive. I mean, I will be. If I live. Anyway, when my insurance money came through, well... I just wanted to see the world from space, have a real once-in-a- lifetime experience.\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 5\nDOCTOR: Space tourism! Yes, it was quite a fad in this period. Well, until the Daedalus tragedy, of course. (TUTS) Those poor people. (HESITANTLY) This ship wouldn’t happen to be called the Daedalus... would it?\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 6\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3: INT. DAEDALUS — CORRIDOR\nGARVEY: I expect we’ll be going back in the Doctor’s ship — leave the Daedalus behind.\nADRIANA: I expect so.\nGARVEY: Adriana, I just want you to know — when we’re back on the ground... you know, on Earth?\nADRIANA: I remember where the ground is.\nGARVEY: There’1l be no legal ramifications. What I’m trying to say is, uh...\nADRIANA: You’re not going to sue me. How magnanimous of you, Mr Garvey.\nGARVEY: I’1ll manage.\nADRIANA: That’s a weight off my mind.\nGARVEY: Probably start up another company.\nADRIANA: It’s just that easy for you, isn’t it? “King of the entrepreneurs”.\nGARVEY: I wanted to call my autobiography ‘I Did It My Way,’ but there were legal issues. Look, that doesn’t matter.\nADRIANA: None of it does.\nGARVEY: You don’t have to think that way now. Once the Doctor’s examined us, we can get out of here.\nADRIANA: Looks that way, doesn’t it, Garvey?\nADRIANA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 7\nGARVEY: I wish you’d call me Mervyn.\nADRIANA: I wish you’d call me Captain.\nADRIANA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 8\nADRIANA: SCENE 4: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE\nCYNTHIA: It started with the first spacewalk. It was supposed to be me, but I wanted to see someone else try it first, so I’d know it was safe. Poor- I can’t even remember her name, isn’t that awful? I suppose I thought we’d all have time to get to know each other.\nDOCTOR: It’s a typical human failing to imagine there’1ll always be enough time.\nCYNTHIA: She was loving it, I’ve never heard anyone so happy. Then the thing happened.\nDOCTOR: If I’m to help you and your friends, Cynthia, I’m going to need a more detailed description than “the thing”.\nCYNTHIA: I’m not really good with- you know-\nDOCTOR: Words.\nCYNTHIA: Yeah, them. OK, let me think. Nobody saw it coming, it was like a bolt from the blue- Bolt! That’s the word. Like an- a beam or a burst or a bolt. Does the colour matter? — only I didn’t notice.\nDOCTOR: I assume the spacewalk was recorded.\nCYNTHIA: All part of the package. You get a disc of your whole holiday experience. I’m not sure I want one now.\nDOCTOR: I’d like to see the incident for myself.\nCYNTHIA: That’s not going to happen. There’s barely enough power for life-support.\nDOCTOR: Odd, that. Please go on, this anonymous spacewalker was struck by an energy bolt.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page\nCYNTHIA: She wasn’t anonymous, we just didn’t get a chance to talk, that’s all. After the Captain- Adriana — got her spacesuit off, she started to- Ugh! You’ve never seen anything like it!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I might have done.\nCYNTHIA: Half an hour, that was all it took. There wasn’t anything left of her. Nothing recognisable, I mean. Just a load of goo — we had to pour it into the helmet, like soup.\nDOCTOR: A very particular variety of soup.\nCYNTHIA: It was tragic, really. Before the accident, she was so bubbly. And then afterwards... Well, she was still quite bubbly, actually. I suppose that must’ve been the methane.\nDOCTOR: So you, Mr Garvey and Captain Beauvais are the only ones left?\nCYNTHIA: Mervyn’s been my rock. He’s got such wisdom and life experience. And a nice bum for a man of his age. And he’s successful — he does computers.\nDOCTOR: And what about the less fortunate passengers...?\nCYNTHIA: A few hours after that girl, there was another infection — Canadian bloke, I think. That was when we started losing power. And people kept dying — there were fourteen of us to start with. I reckoned we’d either starve or- what was the word I said?\nADRIANA: Liquefy, probably. You must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: A pleasure to meet you, Captain.\nADRIANA: I wish I could say the same. Hands up, please.\nGARVEY: Adriana, what the hell?\nGARVEY: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 10\nDOCTOR: Firing a percussion weapon in a pressurized environment isn’t a particularly wise idea.\nADRIANA: The windows can take it. Besides, we’re dead anyway.\nGARVEY: What are you talking about, he’s a doctor!\nADRIANA: He’s a stowaway, a saboteur. No ship’s docked with the Daedalus.\nCYNTHIA: Sorry, I am completely lost.\nADRIANA: Are you alone, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Alone? Yes, totally alone.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 11\nDOCTOR: SCENE 5: INT. DAEDALUS — COMMUNICATIONS CONSOLE\nACE: Anyone about? I’m not here to make trouble or anything, I just need to use a communications cons- (STOPS WALKING) Never mind, I found one. Right then...\nACE: Oh, you must be joking. Come on, work!\nACE: What is the matter with you, you stupid machine? You’re just lucky I don’t have my baseball bat anymore.\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 12\nACE: SCENE 6: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE\nDOCTOR: Of course, even when I’m on my own, it can get quite crowded — half a dozen voices, each telling me they’d do things differently.\nGARVEY: I think he needs a doctor.\nDOCTOR: I ama doctor.\nADRIANA: No more talking. You’re coming with me.\nGARVEY: Are you sure you know what you’re doing, Adriana? What if he knows how to cure this virus?\nDOCTOR: It’s not any kind of virus, Mr Garvey.\nCYNTHIA: It’s not?\nDOCTOR: I’d love to stop and tell you all about it, but for some reason your Captain has a strict “no chit-chat” policy. Still, food for thought.\nADRIANA: Move!\nCYNTHIA: He seemed so nice an’ all. Who’d have thought it?\nGARVEY: Thought what?\nCYNTHIA: That he was a- you know, whatever he is.\nGARVEY: Something’s not right here, Cynthia.\nGARVEY: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page\nGARVEY: SCENE 7: INT. DAEDALUS — CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: I’ve met some closed-minded people in my time, Captain, but you’re not even prepared to consider the possibility that I might be able to help you?\nADRIANA: Nope.\nDOCTOR: Not much of a one for small-talk, eh? I’1ll be sure to make a note of it in my online review. “Captain Beauvais does not indulge in small-talk; tea and coffee-making facilities in all cabins.”\nADRIANA: Actually, there are. Make yourself a drink while you wait.\nDOCTOR: Thank-you. What exactly am I waiting for?\nADRIANA: The same thing we’re all waiting for, Doctor — death.\nDOCTOR: You’re not going to shoot me? Not that I encourage or condone that sort of behaviour.\nADRIANA: There’s no need. Just give it time.\nDOCTOR: I always do. You know, I’m beginning to revise my notion of what constitutes a pressurized environment.\nADRIANA: Get in the cell.\nDOCTOR: Captain, I cannot for the life of me recall a virus capable not only of liquefying its victims, but also of shutting off your ship’s power.\nDOCTOR: 13\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page\nADRIANA: Well, now you’ll have the opportunity to try and think of one.\nDOCTOR: Aren’t you worried that someone might actually answer your distress call?\nADRIANA: Not remotely.\nDOCTOR: I wonder why.\nADRIANA: No you don’t.\nADRIANA: KNOCKS ON THE DOOR’S GLASS PANEL.\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND THE DOOR) Excuse me, I can’t seem to find the trouser- press.\nDOCTOR: 14\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 15\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE\nGARVEY: Why was Adriana so sure another ship hadn’t docked with us?\nCYNTHIA: She’s the Captain.\nGARVEY: She didn’t know the Doctor was on board until I told her, but she was certain he couldn’t have answered her distress call.\nCYNTHIA: Because she never sent it?\nGARVEY: That’s what I reckon.\nCYNTHIA: Why would she just let us die, Mervyn? Let herself die?\nGARVEY: I don’t care half as much about that as I do about letting the folk back on Earth know what’s happening.\nCYNTHIA: It must be too late now!\nGARVEY: Computers are my business. If there’s a drop of power that can be rerouted, I’1ll find it!\nCYNTHIA: That is the sexiest thing I have ever heard.\nGARVEY: Not a good time, Cynthia.\nCYNTHIA: Right.\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 16\nCYNTHIA: SCENE 9: INT. DAEDALUS — CELL\nDOCTOR: Don’t feel too bad, it’s a mechanical lock, it’s hardly your fault, old- old.. Funny, I spend so much time calling the TARDIS “old girl”, I never stopped to think whether my sonic screwdriver has a gender. So are you a boy or a girl?\nDOCTOR: Boy.\nACE: Would you two like to be left alone?\nDOCTOR: Ace. I was wondering where you’d got to.\nACE: Have you ever worked out what percentage of your life is spent locked up like this?\nDOCTOR: Ace, get me out of here!\nACE: I’m just saying, it’d be a big slice out of a pie chart.\nACE: THE DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: I take it you had no success with that little task I gave you?\nACE: (CAN NOW BE HEARD CLEARLY) If you knew beforehand, why did you even ask me? This isn’t another one of your brilliant schemes, is it?\nDOCTOR: Hardly, but I’m assured that this ship is gradually powering down, and if that’s the case, you wouldn’t have been able to access the passenger manifest.\nACE: What was the point of me doing that if this isn’t where we were supposed to be going?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 17\nDOCTOR: It’s not where we were going, but I have a feeling it’s where we need to be. Shall we be off?\nACE: Not so fast, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ace, I may make a habit of getting locked up, but I prefer not to be incarcerated for any longer than necessary.\nACE: You know something, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: I know many things, including the time it takes to cook a perfect omelette with the eggs of the Harkolian peahen.\nACE: Something about what’s going on here! That’s probably why they locked you up.\nDOCTOR: Not precisely. But I have some very nasty suspicions.\nACE: Then tell me what they are. After all this time, after everything, after Hex, haven’t I earned that?\nDOCTOR: Have you ever heard me talk about the Galparians?\nACE: Galparians? No.\nDOCTOR: I’m not surprised. There are some species even I fear. I always hoped the Earth would be spared their attentions. But I was wrong.\nACE: So what are they, then? Conquerors, killer robots, what?\nDOCTOR: Worse than that. They’re estate agents.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE\nGARVEY: We need a plan.\nCYNTHIA: Not really, there’s only three of us on board. Four, if you count the Doctor.\nGARVEY: One of us has a gun. And it’s not either of us. There’s still some power in the cockpit — I need to work in there without distraction. Can I rely on you, Cynthia?\nCYNTHIA: No-one’s ever relied on me before! Actually, lots of people have relied on me, but I’ve always let them down.\nGARVEY: Again, that’s not really helping.\nCYNTHIA: Mervyn, I promise I will do my utmost for you. (BEAT) What is an ut?\nCYNTHIA: 18\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 19\nCYNTHIA: SCENE 11: INT. DAEDALUS — CORRIDOR\nACE: So they want to sell the world?\nDOCTOR: They want to sell this world, as they have hundreds of thousands of others.\nACE: Well... they can’t.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nACE: It’s ours.\nDOCTOR: Can you prove that? Do you have any official documentation?\nACE: I don’t even have my twenty-five metres swimming certificate any more. I thought this was going to be some sort of threat. Seriously, there is nothing scary about estate agents.\nDOCTOR: The Galparians’ business methods make all other estate agents look ethical by comparison. I don’t think you quite appreciate what’s about to happen to your home planet.\nACE: How could I, I’ve never had a place to sell.\nDOCTOR: This is it — spacesuit storage. (HE STRUGGLES TO TURN THE WHEEL) Ace, would you mind?\nACE: Do a sit-up every couple of hundred years, would you,\nACE: Professor?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 20\nDOCTOR: The Galparians have a standard operating procedure. Stage One: They identify a planet to which no-one has any legal claim. Stage Two: In order to make it more attractive to their clients, they beautify it.\nACE: They should start with Middlesbrough.\nDOCTOR: To the Galparians, beautification means fumigation: the\nDOCTOR: elimination of pests.\nACE: Not liking the sound of that.\nDOCTOR: Come along, Pest.\nCONTINUES INTO: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 21\nCONTINUES INTO: SCENE 12: INT. DAEDALUS — STORAGE ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nACE: We’ve got spacesuits back on the TARDIS, you know.\nDOCTOR: I know. This is where they keep the remains of the crew’s remains.\nACE: In the suits?\nDOCTOR: In the helmets. Look at that.\nDOCTOR: ABOUT.\nACE: This is what’s left of those tourists? I’d say it was impossible, but- I know it’s not. I’ve seen this before.\nDOCTOR: Have you?\nACE: Yeah. At Gabriel Chase.\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 22\nACE: SCENE 13: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE\nGARVEY: (WHISPER) She’s coming! Act natural!\nGARVEY: Natural-er!\nADRIANA: What the hell’s the matter with you two?\nGARVEY: Nothing. Just- the usual. Impending death and that.\nADRIANA: Right. Our intruder’s safely locked away.\nCYNTHIA: Do we know how he got on board?\nADRIANA: I’m certain you don’t, Miss Quince. I did a sweep of the ship, and I found a sort of- blue box... thing. I don’t know what it’s for, but he can’t get to it now.\nGARVEY: Right! Well, I’m just off to, er, use the... facilities.\nADRIANA: Don’t give us a commentary, just go.\nGARVEY: Look, if something happens to me while I’m away, I just want-\nADRIANA: It won’t matter because the same thing will happen to us sooner or later.\nGARVEY: Good point. Yeah. Bye.\nCYNTHIA: Good luck, Mervyn.\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 23\nADRIANA: I know what he’s really doing.\nCYNTHIA: You do?\nADRIANA: He wants a look at that box.\nCYNTHIA: Right! I expect so, yeah.\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 24\nCYNTHIA: SCENE 14: INT. DAEDALUS — CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: Think of it, Ace. If the Daedalus hadn’t been directly in the path of the Galparian signal, what happened to the passengers would be happening all over the Earth!\nACE: And this signal turns people into cream of mushroom.\nDOCTOR: It’s programmed to activate the redundant DNA in the human system. Anyone who hears it reverts to a puddle of primordial sludge.\nACE: That’s the most evil thing I’ve ever heard!\nDOCTOR: That’s estate agents for you. The program must’ve been downloaded by instruments on the original victim’s spacesuit and then re-broadcast periodically throughout the ship.\nACE: Good thing the power drain happened, they’d all be dead a lot sooner.\nACE: Hang on, that doesn’t make any sense! Why’d the Galparians design their program to do the one thing that’d stop it working properly?\nDOCTOR: They didn’t. Someone else did that, and they probably did it from the cockpit.\nACE: And now we’re going to undo it?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s the power drain that’s keeping us alive. I just want to look at the passenger manifest. You wouldn’t mind giving me a hand with the doors again?\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 25\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE.\nCYNTHIA: Listen, Adriana...\nADRIANA: Captain.\nCYNTHIA: It strikes me that we haven’t really talked — got to know each other.\nADRIANA: You know, we haven’t.\nCYNTHIA: I know!\nADRIANA: And I’1l1 be damned if I’m going to start now.\nCYNTHIA: Rude. We’ll just have to find another way to pass the time.\nADRIANA: Like what?\nCYNTHIA: I don’t know. What if I were to punch you in the face?\nADRIANA: I’d like to see you try.\nCYNTHIA: Really? Would you?\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 26\nCYNTHIA: SCENE 16: INT. DAEDALUS — COCKPIT.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t seem to be working. Perhaps if I reversed the popularity...\nACE: Polarity!\nDOCTOR: Polarity, sorry. Haven’t done that in a while. Oh well, old habits dye scarves.\nDOCTOR: That’s more like it! Good work, old boy!\nACE: Why are we wasting time with the passenger manifest? If we weren’t supposed to land on the Daedalus, why should we know anyone on board?\nACE: Besides, won’t these Galparians just use their program again, as soon as they realise what happened?\nDOCTOR: Good questions all, Ace. And I have one for you — do any of these names seem familiar?\nACE: No.\nDOCTOR: Look, one cancellation — interesting. A chat with Captain Beauvais is in order, I think.\nACE: (DEPARTING) Seeing as how she thinks you’re locked up, how d’you suppose she’s going to react?\nDOCTOR: (DEPARTING) Based on what little I know of her, I expect she’1l be furious...\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 27\nGARVEY: (TO SELF) I thought they’d never leave.\nGARVEY: (GROANS) Aah! That cramp’s not going away anytime soon. At least they didn’t see me. Well, Doctor, looks like you’ve done half my job for me — thanks! Let’s hope Cynthia’s keeping the Captain distracted...\nGARVEY: Y.A.T.D. — #4:\nGARVEY: SCENE 17:\nGARVEY: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott\nADRIANA: (HER CRIES SUGGEST SHE’S GETTING\nCYNTHIA: You like that, do ya?

Ladies, there’s no need to fight over me.\nADRIANA: We’re not!\nDOCTOR: Well, please stop, all the same.\nADRIANA: What do you want on my ship?\nACE: Long story short: aliens, real estate, deadly computer program, Earth in danger.\nDOCTOR: Now, Cynthia, would you be so kind as to let the Captain up, so I can shake her hand?\nCYNTHIA: What? Why?\nDOCTOR: For saving the planet. By shutting off the ship’s power, she prevented the program from ever reaching Earth.\nCYNTHIA: She did that?\nADRIANA: That’s right.\nDOCTOR: But not for the sake of humanity. On second thoughts, I’ve had a change of hearts; I don’t think I would like to shake your hand. You see, you didn’t sacrifice the passengers on this ship to save the Earth... did you?\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 30\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18: INT. DAEDALUS — COCKPIT.\nGARVEY: That ought to do it. Come get us, fellas.\nGARVEY: Oh yeah. Cynthia’s letter. What was that all about, anyway...?\nGARVEY: (READS) “It’s been so long since I had to write anything by hand...”\nGARVEY: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 31\nGARVEY: SCENE 19: INT. DAEDALUS — LOUNGE.\nADRIANA: My reasons were far from petty, Doctor. Can you imagine the lawsuits I’d be looking at once we got back?\nCYNTHIA: Lawsuits?\nADRIANA: Failure to provide adequate quarantine facilities.\nACE: If by “adequate” you mean “any”.\nADRIANA: This is my company, my ship! It would’ve crippled me!\nACE: Whereas, if you stay up here, you just get killed. You really have a weird set of priorities, you know that?\nADRIANA: There’s no point carrying on a life that’s not worth living.\nCYNTHIA: We didn’t get a say in that!\nADRIANA: Who? You and the passengers whose names you couldn’t be bothered to remember?\nACE: You can carry on this fight when we get back on the ground — I’ll even referee. But some aliens just tried to melt the human race! How long ‘til they try again?\nDOCTOR: I think we have a little time, Ace. What’s important is the original program’s trapped inside the ship’s systems. So long as no-one contacts Earth-\nGARVEY: I did it, I contacted Earth.\nDOCTOR: WHAT!!!\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 32\nGARVEY: Distress call sent, just waiting on a reply. Who’s your friend, by the way?\nDOCTOR: You idiot!\nGARVEY: Yeah, I just saved us all, no thanks to you, Captain!\nGARVEY: Look what I found — a confession!\nCYNTHIA: That’s old news, Mervyn.\nDOCTOR: Why will no-one listen to me when I’m calling them an idiot? The Galparian program will be embedded in that distress call! It’s on the way to Earth right now!\nADRIANA: How long do they have? Days?\nDOCTOR: Probably hours. Adriana, you may not care about anyone on this ship, but how do you feel about an entire world?\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nADRIANA: What do you want me to do?\nDOCTOR: Restore power.\nADRIANA: On it!\nCYNTHIA: I thought if that happened, we were all dead.\nACE: It’s not going to matter if there’s nowhere to go home to!\nGARVEY: Hold on, hold on. I’d like an explanation if it’s not too much trouble.\nGARVEY: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page\nDOCTOR: It is! Where’s the nearest communications console?\nCYNTHIA: Ten metres down on your left.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Ace!\nGARVEY: I’m not following this at all. What’s a Galparian, and what’s this about a signal?\nACE: There’s no time for this any more! Look, you trusted the Doctor when you thought he was here to help, didn’t you?\nGARVEY: So?\nACE: He really is here to help. He just didn’t know it then. Gotta go!\nSHE EXITS INTO: 33\nSHE EXITS INTO: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 34\nSHE EXITS INTO: SCENE 19: INT.

It all depends on the Daedalus’s processing capacity.\nACE: Cross your fingers, then.\nDOCTOR: I’d rather not — it’s going to make locating the Galparians even trickier.\nACE: You’re never going to be able to get in touch with them from here!\nDOCTOR: I don’t need to. I just need to locate one of their advertising satellites... express my interest...\nDOCTOR: . and wait for a response.\nBAILIFF: Good-day, valued customer.\nDOCTOR: Am I speaking to the Galparian Bailiff?\nBAILIFF: You are indeed, Mr...?\nDOCTOR: Doctor. The Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 35\nBAILIFF: As you wish. And you’re interested in.. (LOOKING IT UP) the planet... Earth.\nDOCTOR: It’s just come on the market, I understand.\nBAILIFF: Yes. What can I tell you about it? Do you have any questions?\nACE: I’ve got a question. Why don’t you take your rental service and-\nDOCTOR: Ace!\nBAILIFF: Children, they’re such a blessing, aren’t they? And so boisterous.\nDOCTOR: Oh, she’ll sleep tonight.\nBAILIFF: Rest assured, there’s plenty of space for her to tire herself out on Earth.\nDOCTOR: Yes, about the name...\nBAILIFF: It is a bit on the ordinary side, isn’t it? If you buy outright, you’re welcome to change it as you wish (SUDDEN SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH — PAINED) Ahhh! Itching.\nACE: That’1ll be your conscience prickling.\nDOCTOR: Ace, please. The bailiff and I are negotiating.\nBAILIFF: Do forgive me. Must be a reaction to something. Speaking of\nBAILIFF: which, you’re not allergic to water, by any chance?\nDOCTOR: Water?\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 36\nBAILIFF: There’s rather a lot of it, on Earth. If you want the oceans filling in, we can recommend a good contractor — he’s fully licensed, very reliable.\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary. You see, I have no intention of purchasing the Earth.\nBAILIFF: A hoax call. I see. I thought someone of your age would know better.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I never learn. But you misunderstand me. The planet is off the market. I need you to issue the kill code that will nullify your ‘Beautification’ process.\nBAILIFF: Ummm... No.\nDOCTOR: I thought you might say that. Which is why I added a small incentive.\nACE: Did he have that rash before?\nBAILIFF: Rash! (SHRIEKS)\nDOCTOR: Now that I have your attention... I want you to issue your kill code. Then I’1l issue mine.\nACE: Yours?\nBAILIFF: What’s happening to me?\nDOCTOR: It becomes unpleasant rather quickly, fatal shortly thereafter.\nACE: You did this, Doctor?\nACE: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 37\nDOCTOR: Sh! The kill code, please, Bailiff.\nBAILIFF: Yes! Yes! Ow! Ah!\nBAILIFF: There! Now you!\nDOCTOR: With pleasure.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and if you’re thinking of attempting something like this again, I’ve been looking over your own bye-laws. It appears that by saving the Earth on multiple occasions, I am now its de facto owner.\nACE: You are?\nDOCTOR: Feel free to check my bona fides with the races I’ve confounded. You might want to start alphabetically, with the Autons and the Axons, or you could just jump straight to the Daleks.\nBAILIFF: The Dal... That will not be necessary. The planet is no longer among our listings! Good day!\nDOCTOR: And that, Ace, is what’s known as “hard bargaining.”\nDOCTOR: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 38\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20: INT. DAEDALUS — COMMUNICATIONS CONSOLE\nACE: You know, sometimes I forget how ruthless you can be, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ruthless? Nonsense! I have a positive over-abundance of ruth.\nACE: You did to the Bailiff exactly what he did to humanity.\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. (FX: ALL STOP WALKING) My program was merely a Simulation of a touch of Draconian scale rot. It might itch a bit for a year or six. You don’t disapprove, I hope?\nCYNTHIA: I don’t. — So this is that blue box Adriana was talking about?\nGARVEY: I hope it’s roomier than it looks.\nDOCTOR: Deceptively so.\nGARVEY: Ace tells me you’re the rightful owner of the Earth now.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nGARVEY: Should we be worried? I mean, do you have any plans for it?\nDOCTOR: One or two ideas in the short term. And what about you, Mr Garvey? Cynthia tells me you “do” computers.\nGARVEY: That’s where I made my money, yeah. But the space tourism business... Maybe there’s still a future in it. ‘Course, it’1ll probably take about ten years to build up investor confidence.\nDOCTOR: Twelve. (BEAT) I would imagine.\nCYNTHIA: Oh, nearly forgot! Captain Beauvais says she’s sorry she couldn’t be here to see you off. Something like that, it was hard to make out through a locked door.\nCYNTHIA: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott\nGARVEY: I wonder if the authorities will arrest her or give her a medal.\nACE: Maybe both.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s been a thin slice of heaven, but Ace and I really must be going.\nDOCTOR: Cynthia, Mervyn — I wish you better luck with your next\nDOCTOR: holiday.\nDOCTOR AND ACE ENTER INTO: Page 39\nDOCTOR AND ACE ENTER INTO: Y.A.T.D. — #4: DEAD TO THE WORLD by Matthew J Elliott Page 40\nDOCTOR: Where next, Ace? The TARDIS is yours to command.\nACE: I wish. I don’t think it wants me at the controls.\nDOCTOR: She.\nACE: Suit yourself. You can tell her I know when I’m beaten — you can choose the destinations from now on. (DEPARTING) Any aliens show up wanting to kill me, point them in the direction of my room.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll tell them not to wake you. (PAUSE) I know what you’re playing at. I’m talking to you, “Old Girl”. You’re the one setting the controls, and I think I know why. You’re looking for someone, aren’t you? Someone who fell foul of the Porcians?\nDOCTOR: I thought so. And that same someone was invited to Edwin Norris’ party under the name ‘Ms Zingiber’ .. and was a guest at\nDOCTOR: the Grand Betelguese Hotel... and failed to take her place on the Daedalus.\nDOCTOR: You’ve not been having much success, have you? So... let me help."
