What the hell’s going on?\nACE: What makes you think I have any idea?\nHEX: One minute I’m getting my head down for a kip, the next all the lights have gone out and the whole place is lurching like a bucking bronco, making a noise like a steam engine giving birth.\nACE: You’re welcome to look at the controls. See if you can make any sense of them.\nHEX: Well, those are the warning lights, right? Only I’ve never seen them all lit up at once before.\nHEX: What’s that? Doesn’t sound good.\nACE: It’s not. It means the TARDIS is in serious trouble and that the pilot should get to the control room A.S.A.P.\nHEX: The Doctor? Yeah, where is he?\nACE: I don’t know. But if he’s not answering the cloister bell, that can only mean one thing. (BEAT) The Doctor is not in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 3\nHEX: Well, he’s not in his room. Or the games room, or the gym, the sauna, the [library] —\nACE: He’s not on board, Hex. Internal scan registers only two life forms in the TARDIS. You and me.\nHEX: So the Doctor’s done a bunk?\nACE: He wouldn’t leave us, not unless he was forced to.\nHEX: (INCREASINGLY PANICKED) You mean he’s been kidnapped. Great. The Doc’s been kidnapped!\nACE: Well, that explains the cloister bell. It’s the TARDIS’s way of letting us know he’s been abducted.\nHEX: Doesn’t explain why everything else has gone haywire though.\nACE: Hex. Panicking isn’t going to help the situation.\nHEX: No? Well, I’m sorry, Ace, but I can’t think of anything better to do under the circumstances!\nACE: If the Doctor’s not on board, then it’s up to us to try to sort things out.\nHEX: How do you suggest we do that? Play a game of TARDIS console lucky dip until something happens? You press all the red buttons, I’ll press all the green ones?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 4\nACE: These are the controls that deal with materialization. If I can land the TARDIS, we might be able to get help.\nHEX: Yeah, good luck with that, landing us somewhere with a TARDIS repair service.\nACE: Well, do you have any better ideas?\nHEX: No. Like I said, ‘panicking’ was kind of my best one.\nACE: Well, I’m going to try and materialize, are you going to try and stop me?\nHEX: No. No, you go for it, doll.\nACE: Watch it, mush. (DEEP BREATH) Alright. Here goes. —\nACE: (FX: BUTTONS ON CONSOLE BEING PRESSED. TARDIS SOUNDS WORSE, BUT CLOISTER BELL STOPS)\nHEX: Hey, doesn’t the Doctor normally press that switch first?\nACE: Hex! He presses that switch last.\nHEX: No, that’s for take-offs, he presses it first for landings.\nACE: Look. If this doesn’t work, you can have a go. But until then, let me get on with it.

You’ve dug quite a trench there.\nALBERT: I’ve been at it half the morning. (DRINKS TEA) Hits the spot.\nPEGGY: You just be careful, I don’t want you tramping mud all over the carpet.\nALBERT: Don’t worry, I’1ll put some newspaper down first.\nPEGGY: And when you’ve done that you can do the windows.\nALBERT: Blimey, Peg, you’re a real slave-driver today.\nPEGGY: I know you, Albert Marsden — given half a chance you’1l be in that potting shed of yours with your feet up snoring to the high heavens. You finished with that cup?\nALBERT: Give me a chance. (FINISHES IT) All done.\nPEGGY: That’s the eighth one today.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 6\nALBERT: Cup of tea?\nPEGGY: No. Aircraft.\nALBERT: Wonder where they’re going. Haven’t seen any coming back.\nPEGGY: Hope they don’t. I could do with a bit of peace and quiet.\nALBERT: What about me, out here in the freezing cold? Took me years to get the lawn looking nice, and now look at it.\nPEGGY: Well, you just stay away from my herbaceous borders. (BEAT) I tried calling Raymond again.\nALBERT: No answer?\nPEGGY: I was hoping to get through to that answering-machine of his, but it just keeps going \"bleep bleep” at me.\nALBERT: They did say there might be some trouble with the lines, they want them clear for emergencies.\nPEGGY: Isn’t me worrying about my son and daughter-in-law an emergency?\nALBERT: No, love, you know it’s not. Come here.\nPEGGY: Oh no, don’t you try hugging me, not with those dirty hands.\nALBERT: They’1l be all right. Our Raymond’s got a good head on his shoulders.\nPEGGY: You don’t think he’s already left, to join us up here?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page\nALBERT: Not without phoning us first.\nPEGGY: But he might not have been able to phone us first.\nALBERT: Well, he’1ll come when he comes.\nPEGGY: But what if he never comes?\nALBERT: He said he’d come. He promised us.\nPEGGY: Only it’s been so long. He should have been here by now.\nALBERT: Then we’ll just have to keep on waiting, won’t we?\nPEGGY: I don’t think he is ever coming.\nALBERT: Don’t give up. We can’t give up.\nPEGGY: Then what else can we do?\nALBERT: We just have to keep on hoping, that’s all.\nPEGGY: What’s that?\nALBERT: It came from down the lane. Wait here, I’1l go and look.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 8\nHEX: Whoa. We made it.\nACE: If you’re going to make a crack about women drivers, I should warn you, I’ve got a baseball bat in my room.\nHEX: Wasn’t gonna say a word. Though I’ve learned one thing today.\nACE: What’s that?\nHEX: That the TARDIS has a spin cycle.\nACE: Very funny.\nHEX: Well, we’re on Earth, that’s something to be grateful for.\nACE: Come on, let’s get some fresh air.\nHEX: We could always stay put? That cloister gong’s shut up.\nACE: Bell. You can stay here if you like, I’m going outside.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 9\nACE: It’s a bit chilly, you might want to get your coat.\nHEX: No, it’s all right, I’1ll live. Once you’ve felt the Antarctic\nHEX: wind in your kecks, you kind of get a different perspective on the whole cold thing.\nACE: Suit yourself.\nACE: We'll try that cottage, it can’t be more than half a mile.\nHEX: Someone likes to get away from it all. Still, looks twentieth century. Telephone wires but no satellite dish.\nACE: Yeah. And I’m guessing this is the guy who lives there.\nALBERT: (CALLING) Hello! Can I help you?\nHEX: Yeah, maybe you can, we’re a bit... lost.\nALBERT: Lost?\nACE: Yeah. We’ve kind of gone of holiday by accident.\nALBERT: But you don’t have backpacks, what about your tents?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nACE: Hex here was being chased by a bull, and threw our stuff at it to distract it.\nHEX: Hey, I wasn’t the one who was screaming.\nACE: I think you’1ll find it was you who was doing the screaming. Like a little girl.\nALBERT: But you don’t have hiking boots. If you don’t mind me saying, you don’t seem to have come out very prepared.\nHEX: Yeah. Next year we’re doing Skeggy, definite.\nACE: You wouldn’t be able to point us in the direction of the nearest town, would you?\nALBERT: You're a bit out of luck, I’m afraid. The nearest is Hebden Bridge and that’s eight miles. If you don’t me asking, what were you doing inside that thing?\nACE: What thing?\nALBERT: The police box. I saw you getting out.\nALBERT: Haven’t seen one of these for years. Though shouldn’t it be blue?\nALBERT: I don’t remember ever seeing a white one before.\nHEX: Ace, I think it’s time we told this good gentleman the truth.\nACE: The truth?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nHEX: The thing is I’m due to get married tomorrow, and last night was my stag do. And my hilarious mates, well, as a joke they must have waited until I was out cold and then locked me up in that police box, because the next thing I know I’m waking up inside it with this young lady here.\nACE: (EMBARRASSED) Hex!\nALBERT: In my day we just spent the evening playing dominoes.\nHEX: Yeah, I’m kind of wishing that’s what we’d done too.\nALBERT: So this young lady, she would be — (a)\nACE: The innocent victim of a cruel prank. So if you could see your way clear to giving us a lift, we’d be dead grateful.\nALBERT: Well, I don’t know about a lift, but you’re welcome to use the telephone.\nHEX: Thanks, that would be a great help.\nALBERT: I’m Albert, by the way. Albert Marsden. And you are “Hex”?\nHEX: Yeah. Short for Hector. Thomas Hector Schofield.\nALBERT: And your friend’s name?\nACE: Call me Ace.\nALBERT: Ace?\nHEX: Yeah. (ASIDE) She wouldn’t tell me her real name either.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nALBERT: (CALLING) I’m back, dear.\nPEGGY: Who is it? Is it —\nALBERT: No, love. It’s a young gentleman, Hex, and his friend Ace.\nPEGGY: Why do young people have to have such funny names?\nALBERT: You can hardly talk, love. You wouldn’t have me in the house if I started going around calling you Margaret.\nPEGGY: That’s different, everybody’s always called me Peggy. And I don’t like that name, it reminds me of that woman.\nACE: Nice to meet you, Peggy.\nALBERT: They were wondering if they might use our telephone.\nPEGGY: Well, they’re welcome to try, but I can’t even get through to our Dot now.\nALBERT: They said the phone’s only for emergencies, I hardly think you calling your sister counts.\nPEGGY: I suppose whatever these young people need the telephone for is an emergency?\nACE: It is, yes, I’m afraid.\nPEGGY: Well in that case, follow me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nACE: Thank you, you’re very kind.\nACE: (FX: ACE AND PEGGY HEAD INDOORS DURING THE ABOVE, CLOSING THE DOOR AFTERWARDS. )\nHEX: Nice place you’ve got here.\nALBERT: Yes. We’ve been here five years, ever since I retired.\nHEX: If you don’t mind me asking, though, why are you digging up your lawn? Decided to go for vegetables?\nALBERT: No. It’s to fill the cardboard boxes.\nHEX: The what?\nALBERT: We’re supposed to pile them up against the walls of our fall-out room. To keep out the radiation.\nHEX: What did you just say?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nACE: Hello. Is there anyone there? Hello. Hello?\nPEGGY: No luck, dear?\nACE: No. I’m not even getting an engaged tone.\nPEGGY: Yes, it’s been like that for the last hour. I expect one of the wires has come down. We’re always getting cut off in storms.\nACE: Has there been a storm?\nPEGGY: No. Odd that. (BEAT) I’m sorry if you can’t phone your friends. Would a cup of tea help?\nACE: Yes, that would be lovely, thank you.\nHEX: Ace, you'll never believe —\nPEGGY: Feet! On the newspapers.\nHEX: sorry.\nPEGGY: It’s bad enough with Albert without everyone else tramping dirt\nPEGGY: in. I was just making some tea, would you like a cup?\nHEX: What? Oh, yeah. That would be fantastic.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nPEGGY: Well I don’t know about ‘fantastic’ but I’11l do my best.\nHEX: Ace, there’s something going on here. Something weird.\nACE: You’re telling me. The phone is dead.\nHEX: Dead? Who were you trying to call, anyway?\nACE: UNIT. What do you mean, ‘something weird’?\nHEX: The old fella out there, he says he’s building a fall-out shelter.\nACE: A fall-out shelter?\nHEX: Yeah. Like in a nuclear war.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ALL ANNOUNCEMENTS OPEN WITH LOW RUMBLE, LIKE AFTER AN EXPLOSION. THEN ANNOUNCER, THEN THE CLOSING THEME. )\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Your first priority is to make a fall-out room to protect you from radioactive fall-out. This should be the room in your home which is furthest away from the exterior walls and roof. If you have a basement, use that.\nANNOUNCER: (FX: CLOSING THEME — SINISTER MOOG NOTE, SERIES OF SINISTER MOOG BLEEPS, ANOTHER SINISTER MOOG NOTE. )\nPEGGY: Here you go, love. You can do your own milk and sugar.\nHEX: Peggy. Your husband said he’s building a fall-out shelter.\nPEGGY: Oh, that. Waste of time if you ask me. But he says we have to be prepared.\nACE: You think there’s going to be a nuclear war?\nPEGGY: No, but it doesn’t matter what I think. The government says we have to. They even put a leaflet through our front door.\nHEX: Can I see this leaflet?\nPEGGY: Didn’t you get one? I think Albert had it.\nALBERT: What’s that, love?\nPEGGY: The leaflet, the one from the government. Have you got it?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nALBERT: Here. What’s the matter?\nHEX: (READS) “Protect and Survive. What to do to make you and your family as safe as possible in the event of nuclear attack.”\nACE: I think I heard about that once in a documentary, it was a thing in the early eighties. But the leaflets were never sent out, I’m sure.\nPEGGY: No, dear. We got this one through, when was it?\nALBERT: The day before yesterday.\nPEGGY: That’s right. Maybe they haven’t sent them out yet where you live. I’m not surprised, what with all the strikes. Honestly, you’d think the teachers and the — (postmen)\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Use thick, dense materials to make the walls of your fall-out room thicker to protect against radiation. Use bricks, concrete blocks, timber, or boxes of earth and sand.\nACE: But why? Why are you building the shelter?\nPEGGY: Because it’s our best chance, if the worst comes to the worst. Haven’t you seen the news?\nHEX: No, I’m afraid I’ve been a bit busy.\nPEGGY: Both of you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nACE: Yes.\nPEGGY: What do you do, by the way?\nHEX: I’m a nurse, and Ace here, well, she —\nACE: I travel. A lot. So tell us. What’s been happening in the news?\nPEGGY: We don’t have time to sit around talking all day. I’ve got to tape up the windows, and Albert still has to move the boxes.\nHEX: Look, how about Ace and I help you out? Might as well make ourselves useful while we’re here.\nPEGGY: Well, I suppose an extra pair of hands would come in useful.\nALBERT: Well, then. Boxes is in the garden, lad.\nACE: Go on, Hex. You could do with beefing up a bit.\nHEX: Aw, go bake a cake! (EXITS WITH ALBERT)\nPEGGY: Right, then, young lady. Windows it is. Reckon I’ve a spare pinny somewhere.\nACE: Pinny?\nPEGGY: You don’t want to be getting your clean things mucky.\nACE: Alright, whatever. But while we’re about it — you can tell us everything that’s been going on.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nALBERT: All those boxes are to go along the living room wall, same side as the stairs.\nHEX: Same side as the stairs, got you.\nHEX: You think there’s really going to be a war?\nALBERT: I don’t know. I think politicians are damn fool enough to do anything. Particularly our lot.\nHEX: And you think this shelter’s going to make a difference?\nALBERT: That’s what the government are saying. You know what I think, though. I think it’s all just a big bluff.\nHEX: A bluff?\nALBERT: We’ve got to show the Ruskies that we’re serious and we’re not going to back down. That’s why they’ve sent out the leaflets. To show them we mean business.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nPEGGY: I’m trying to think back to how it all started. Here, love, you hold the chair while I get the net curtains.\nPEGGY: (FX: FLOOR SCRAPES, CURTAINS BEING TAKEN DOWN DURING THE\nFOLLOWING: )\nACE: You sure you don’t want me to do it?\nPEGGY: No, they’re my curtains. And then you can help me put them in the airing cupboard. I don’t want them getting any paint on them.\nACE: Paint? What paint?\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: You must also prepare the rest of your house to limit the damage from heat and blast. Remove anything flammable such as net curtains, newspapers and magazines. You should then coat the windows with diluted white paint, to reflect the heat flash.\nPEGGY: Yes, that was it. It was all something to do with the uprisings they were having in all those Eastern Bloc countries, like Poland and Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\nACE: Yes, I remember, there were all the protests for democracy.\nPEGGY: Well, the Russian President, he told them all to go home, and when they didn’t, he sent in the tanks.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nALBERT: I remember seeing it on the news. They just opened fire on the demonstrators... even the children.\nHEX: At the orders of the Soviet President? Gorbachov?\nALBERT: What? No. General Secretary Vladimir Kryuchkov. I remember the name because he sounds like a James Bond villain. And then there were more demonstrations in East Germany, along the Berlin wall, and so the Russians went into West Berlin, to restore order... or so they said.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nPEGGY: But this meant all the American bases in West Berlin were now controlled by the Russians, so the Americans gave the Russians an ultimatum.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nALBERT: And then one of our satellites spots there are Soviet tanks gathering on the border with West Germany, at a town called Helmstedt. For defence, the Soviets say, but by then it’s too late as the Americans have dropped a bomb on it. What they call a battlefield nuclear weapon.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nPEGGY: That was three days ago. The news has been quiet ever since. I think they’re deciding what to do next.\nACE: And it all started with the uprisings... So it’s 1989?\nPEGGY: Yes. The ninth of November. Don’t you even know that?\nACE: So, what do we do after we’ve whitewashed the windows?\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Inside your fallout room you should prepare an inner refuge, to give you extra protection during the first two days after the attack, when the danger from radiation is most critical.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nALBERT: Careful, watch your step, it’s very steep.\nHEX: Nice fall-out shelter, mate. Liking it.\nALBERT: Just put the box by the entrance of the inner refuge, but not blocking the way in.\nHEX: You’re planning on spending two weeks down here?\nALBERT: No. The inner refuge is just for the first two days. For the rest of the two weeks, we’re allowed to use the rest of the room.\nHEX: Wow, luxury. And then what?\nALBERT: And then they’1l sound the all-clear, and we can come out.\nHEX: If there’s anything left.\nALBERT: I wouldn’t worry, lad. Nothing’s going to actually happen.\nHEX: Yeah. Either that or you’re dead no matter what you do, and this is just their way of keeping you busy.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: You will need to store enough food and water in your fallout room for each member of your family for fourteen days. Choose foods which can be eaten cold and which are tinned or well-wrapped. Don’t forget to make sure you have a tin opener in your inner refuge.\nANNOUNCER: (FX: PEGGY IS FILLING BOTTLES FROM THE TAP AS ACE SORTS THROUGH CUTLERY DRAWERS )\nACE: Tin opener. Tin opener — here!\nPEGGY: Any more bottles, love?\nACE: No, the only other thing I could find was a watering can.\nPEGGY: Hmmm. I suppose it counts as a container.\nACE: Is all this for you and Albert?\nPEGGY: What’s that, dear?\nACE: Only the leaflet says three and a half gallons per person, and you must have stored more than twice that.\nACE: I’m sorry, have I said something wrong?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nPEGGY: No, dear. It’s.. when you arrived, we were expecting, hoping for someone else to turn up.\nACE: Who?\nPEGGY: My son Raymond, and his wife Joanna. They said they’d come up to stay with us, but I haven’t heard from them for two days. They live in London, you see. But the radio has been saying that the motorways are for essential services only.\nACE: I’m sorry. I’m sure he’s on his way.\nPEGGY: That’s very kind of you to say, dear. (BEAT) It’s funny. He’s a grown man now, but when I picture him, I still see a little boy playing cowboys and Indians in the garden. Just underneath that apple tree.\nACE: He must have had a wonderful childhood, growing up here.\nPEGGY: Couldn’t wait to leave, first chance he got, though.\nALBERT: Inner refuge finished and ready for inspection, ma’am.\nPEGGY: You’re not getting me down in that cellar, Albert Marsden. You can carry the water down there yourself.\nHEX: It’s alright, I’1ll help.\nALBERT: No, lad, you’ve done enough.\nPEGGY: And then you can clear all the newspapers from the hall.\nACE: Why don’t you let us do that? We can do it on our way out.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nPEGGY: Are you leaving us, love?\nACE: Well, if we’re walking to the next town, we should make a start.\nPEGGY: If you’re sure. The newspapers, they go in the garage. Albert bundles them up for the Scouts to do recycling.\nACE: Okay. And thanks, for being so kind.\nPEGGY: Not at all, dear. It’s been nice having someone to talk to other than the radio.\nALBERT: That radio! It never stops.\nACE: Yes. I hope... I hope you don’t have to wait too much longer. Goodbye.\nHEX: Yeah, cheers.\nPEGGY: Goodbye, and good luck.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nHEX: So why you were so keen to clear away the newspapers?\nACE: Isn’t it obvious? To find out what’s been going on.\nACE: Three days ago. “Parliament passes emergency powers act. All airports are to be closed. All hospitals are to be cleared of non-critical patients to make room for expected casualties.”\nHEX: Four days ago. “Following widespread panic-buying of petrol, number ten has announced that remaining supplies are to be restricted to official vehicles. Stocks of tinned food are at a critical level.”\nACE: “Anti-war demonstrations in London, Manchester and Liverpool end in riots and looting. Curfews are now imposed in all cities.”\nHEX: Yesterday. “The Archbishop of Canterbury has appealed for calm and for prayers for peace, as the government places all emergency services on stand-by.”\nACE: Today. “The Prime Minister has flown to Paris for a meeting of NATO, but remains “optimistic” of a diplomatic solution. Foreign office sources refuse to confirm reports of a series of nuclear explosions in the Middle East.”\nHEX: But none of this ever happened.\nACE: No. Something’s wrong.\nHEX: Maybe, I don’t know, we’re in a parallel universe?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nACE: Or something has changed the course of history. Bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war.\nHEX: But it’s not going to happen, is it? No-one would ever really push the button, would they?\nACE: I hope you’re right, Hex. Because whatever’s going on, we’re\nACE: stuck here for the foreseeable future.\nHEX: No. No, there’s still a way out. The TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nALBERT: Have they gone, dear?\nPEGGY: They’re just off down the lane. Pity. I liked them.\nALBERT: Don’t worry, love. They’1ll be back, soon enough. It’s not as if there’s anywhere else they can go.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO) If an attack with nuclear weapons is expected, you will hear the following sound.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: If you are at home when you hear this sound, turn off the gas and electricity at the mains, and go to your fallout room. If you are not at home, but can get there within two minutes, do so. Otherwise take cover at your place of work. If you are in the open, take cover in the nearest building. If you cannot reach a building, lie flat on the ground and cover your head and your hands.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nHEX: Come on, it should be just around the next corner.\nACE: It’s gone. The TARDIS has gone.\nHEX: It must have dematerialized. Without us.\nACE: But it can’t have.\nHEX: Yeah. Unless.\nACE: Unless what?\nHEX: Unless the Doctor was still in it.\nACE: The Doctor wouldn’t abandon us. (BEAT) We can’t hang around here. We have to make contact with UNIT somehow.\nHEX: What do you suggest? We walk to the next town?\nACE: Walk? Don’t you know how to drive?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nHEX: You’re not going to nick Albert’s car?\nACE: Borrow, that’s all.\nHEX: You can’t hotwire a Morris Minor, it’s practically vintage!\nACE: I don’t have to.\nHEX: Hey, where d’you get those?\nACE: (FX: OPENING CAR DOOR) Toby jug on the sideboard. I thought, just in case... (BEAT) Oh, get in, will you?\nHEX: (GETTING IN) Look, I’m not sure about this. —\nALBERT: (FROM DOORWAY, OFF) Glad to hear it, lad.\nACE: Rumbled. (ALOUD) Albert. Sorry about this, but we don’t have any choice. We’ll make sure you get it back.\nALBERT: (FX: SCRAPING ON CONCRETE AS HE HEFTS SPADE LIKE A WEAPON) No, young lady. You’1ll give it back, right now.\nHEX: Albert, mate. Put the spade down, eh?\nALBERT: (JABBING SPADE) Go on, get out of it!\nACE: You keep on swinging that thing about, you’1ll ruin your paintwork!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nALBERT: I’1l paintwork you, [young lady]\nACE: What’s that?\nHEX: Oh no.\nALBERT: That’s the air attack warning. (FX: DROPS SPADE) Oh my. The air attack warning!\nACE: Then it’s really happening?\nHEX: (SHAKING HER) Ace. Ace! They’ve only gone and started World War Three!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO, FROM KITCHEN)\nANNOUNCER: Air attack warning. Go to your fall-out room or take shelter. Do not panic. Stay calm. This is not a test. Repeat. (MESSAGE REPEATS IN B/G THROUGH: )\nPEGGY: Albert, we have to close all the doors! The windows, too —\nPEGGY: (STOPS, SURPRISED) Oh!\nACE: Hello again, Peggy.\nPEGGY: You came back! Both of you!\nHEX: Yeah, we were hoping you might have room for us in your shelter?\nALBERT: You expect us to take you in? [After-]\nPEGGY: (CUTTING OVER) We can hardly leave them outside.\nALBERT: I suppose not, but.\nACE: Thanks, you’re a life-saver.\nPEGGY: Oh! Oh my! The box! With our birth certificates! It’s upstairs!\nALBERT: You'll have to leave it, love.\nPEGGY: It’ll only take a minute. You can do the gas, and the electric!\nALBERT: No, love. We have to go down to the inner refuge.\nACE: He’s right, Peggy.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nPEGGY: What about the kitchen? We didn’t do the kitchen. —\nHEX: Peggy, love, we have to get into the basement.\nALBERT: (EXPLOSIVELY) Now!!!\nPEGGY: Don’t you raise your voice, Albert Marsden. (FX: OPENING CUPBOARD DOOR) I’m going, alright? — I’m going.\nACE: Wait. The radio. It’s stopped. Maybe it was a false alarm.\nALBERT: No. ‘The first part of an air attack would consist of a warhead being detonated in the atmosphere, to knock out communication systems with an electromagnetic pulse.’ That’s what the leaflet said.\nHEX: Ace, it’s really happening. Ace!\nALBERT: Into the shelter, both of [you] —\nALBERT: (FX: TO INDICATE THE LIGHT, THE MUSIC SHOULD EITHER CUT OUT OR GIVE ONE CONTINUOUS PIERCING HIGH NOTE LIKE TINNITUS. SIREN ENDS HERE. )\nALBERT: (GASP) The light.\nALBERT: (WE HEAR ALL THREE CHARACTERS REACTING, WINCING IN FEAR AND PAIN, THEN THE SOUND CUTS OUT, THEN WE HEAR THEM AGAIN.)\nACE: Don’t look at it! Hex!!!\nHEX: I can see the bones in my hand. Like an x-ray.\nACE: Hex, close your eyes!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 37\nHEX: I’m closing them, I’m closing them!\nACE: No. (NO LONGER IN PAIN) It’s alright, the light’s gone now. It’s safe for you to open your eyes again.\nHEX: What? But... I can’t see.\nALBERT: We’ve got to get into the inner refuge. Before the heat blast hits.\nACE: The heat blast. That wasn’t it?\nALBERT: It’s like lightning, you get the flash, then the bang follows.\nALBERT: Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ALBERT LEADS ACE AND HEX DOWN CELLAR STAIRS. DOOR BANGS SHUT. ACE BOLTS IT)\nACE: Door’s bolted!\nHEX: Ace. I can’t see. I can’t see the stairs!\nACE: Just keep hold of my shoulders. (FX: THEIR FOOTSTEPS TO FIT:) Step. Step. Step.

Try not to worry about it. It’s probably only temporary.\nHEX: Yeah, and if it’s not?\nPEGGY: Albert, where are you going?\nALBERT: I’ve got to check upstairs.\nPEGGY: No. You’1ll die up there.\nACE: Your wife’s right, Albert.\nALBERT: No. It’s in the leaflet...\nALBERT: (READS) “After the attack there will be a brief period before fall-out descends.

The TV, all the plastic and metal has fused together. The force of the wind must have put out any fires.\nALBERT: The photos on the mantelpiece, of our wedding day. The glass has melted.

Was there anything else we had to do while we were out here?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nALBERT: I — I can’t think...\nACE: Someone’s shooting.\nALBERT: No. That’s the fall-out warning.

It can be carried by winds for hundreds of miles before falling to the ground. The radiation from this dust cannot be seen, felt or smelt but exposure to it, even for a few minutes, can cause sickness and even death.\nPEGGY: So this friend of yours, he’s still out there?\nHEX: I don’t know. I suppose so.\nPEGGY: Like our Raymond.

What’s it like up there?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nALBERT: It’s not actually that bad. A few broken windows, that’s all.\nALBERT: Isn’t that right, Ace?\nACE: Yeah, that’s right.\nPEGGY: Oh. I thought it would be more than that, from the sound.\nHEX: What are you doing?\nALBERT: Sealing the inner refuge. We’ll have to sit tight in here\nPEGGY: My throat’s all dry. Could do with a cup of tea.\nALBERT: Peggy love, we’ve no way of boiling the water.\nPEGGY: I suppose not. Could you pass one of those bottles, Hex?\nHEX: You’re going to have to give me a bit more to go on.\nPEGGY: By your head.\nHEX: Right... got one.

When the Doctor gets here, he’1ll sort you out.\nHEX: I wish had your faith.\nALBERT: I’m sorry, who are you talking about?\nPEGGY: They have a friend called the Doctor.\nALBERT: The Doctor?\nACE: And I know that wherever he is, he’ll be doing his best to find us.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: The first two days will be the most dangerous. Remain within your inner refuge, no matter how uncomfortable it may be. If you have to leave your inner refuge for water, food or sanitation, make sure your time outside is as brief as possible. Do not leave your fall-out room under any circumstances.\nHEX: How long has it been?\nALBERT: Hang on, I’11 look.\nALBERT: It’s just gone eleven. So about twelve hours.\nPEGGY: Albert, do you think we should look outside?\nALBERT: We’re not supposed to, love. Remember. The fall-out.\nPEGGY: But what if Raymond’s come? He’1ll be wondering where we’ve got to.\nALBERT: We’d have heard his car, dear.\nPEGGY: Yes, I suppose so. Could I have another of those pills?\nALBERT: You still got that headache?\nPEGGY: Yes. It’s worse now.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nALBERT: You’re not meant to take more than two every four hours. You’1ll have to wait, I’m afraid.\nACE: (CHANGING SUBJECT) What’s he like, your Raymond?\nALBERT: What’s he like?\nACE: What does he do?\nPEGGY: Something with computers. He’s tried explaining it to us but it’s too complicated.\nALBERT: Computers are the future, he’s always said. He studied them at university.\nPEGGY: We’ve got a photo of him somewhere, excuse me —\nHEX: Ow! (SQUEEZED) Hey, careful, squeezed in here.\nPEGGY: Sorry, love. Can you pass me that book? By your shoulder.\nHEX: Here.\nPEGGY: There, that’s our Raymond and Joanna at their wedding.\nACE: He’s very handsome.\nPEGGY: It was only a small do, Raymond’s never been one for making friends. We were ever so happy when he found Joanna, weren’t we?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nALBERT: Two proper love birds, they were...\nPEGGY: Just like us at their age. Oh, I wish had the photos from our wedding to show you, Ace, but they’re upstairs.\nACE: Yeah, I remember seeing them.\nPEGGY: He always looked so dashing in his uniform. He even wrote me a poem once. No-one had ever written me a poem before.\nALBERT: Peggy, you’re embarrassing me.\nPEGGY: You shouldn’t be embarrassed, it was very good.\nPEGGY: I think I might be able to go to sleep now.\nALBERT: Me too. What about you, Hex?\nHEX: Yeah. There’s not exactly a lot to stay awake for.\nALBERT: Ace?\nACE: Yeah, I’m shattered. Goodnight, Albert, Peggy.\nACE: ALBERT & PEGGY: Goodnight.\nALBERT: (WHISPER) Just had a thought. Me, going to sleep next to a young woman.\nPEGGY: (WHISPER) And me, going to sleep next to a young man!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nALBERT: (WHISPER) See you in the morning, love.\nPEGGY: (WHISPER) See you in the morning.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: After two days, the danger from fall-out will be reduced and it will be relatively safe for you to spend time outside your inner refuge. But it will not be safe for you to leave your fall-out room.\nHEX: (STRETCHING) Good to stretch my legs at least. Cooped up in there, I was getting cramp.\nACE: Peggy, how are you feeling today?\nPEGGY: Still a bit shivery.\nALBERT: That’s just the stress, love. Wears you out.\nPEGGY: And I was sick in the night. Twice.\nALBERT: Lucky we’ve got our own private nurse to look after you.\nHEX: Yeah, you just try and get some rest.\nPEGGY: I’ve been lying down for two days, I’m fed up of rest. What I need is fresh air.\nACE: We all do. Sitting in the dark does your head in.\nHEX: Tell me about it.\nACE: It’s not my fault you can’t see, Hex.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nHEX: No, it’s my own stupid fault, that’s the worst thing about it. Well, the second worse — after not being able to see.\nALBERT: Calm down, lad.\nHEX: Calm down? For all we know we’re the last four people left.\nACE: We survived. There will be other survivors.\nHEX: Oh, you’re sure of that, are you? Just like you were sure that the Doctor would turn up and rescue us.\nACE: He will.\nHEX: Well he’s taking his time about it, that’s all I can say.\nACE: The Doctor will find us.\nHEX: When? After a week? A month? A year? Assuming we’re still alive by then. Assuming the Doctor’s still alive.\nALBERT: The lad does have a point. If your friend was out there —\nACE: He wasn’t out there. (BEAT) I don’t know where he is, but he wasn’t out there.\nHEX: Ace, he vanished from the TARDIS, for all we know he’s been kidnapped by [the Daleks].\nPEGGY: (CUTS IN, SHARPLY) What’s the TARDIS?\nHEX: It’s like our space ship. We travel in time and space.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nACE: Hex!\nHEX: We might as well tell them, what difference will it make?\nALBERT: You travel through time in a space ship?\nHEX: Yeah. You know that Police Box you saw us in? That was it.\nALBERT: Bit small, isn’t it?\nHEX: It’s bigger on the inside. It moves by disappearing from one place and reappearing somewhere else.\nALBERT: So where do you go in this ‘TARDIS’ of yours?\nHEX: All over. Different times, different planets.\nPEGGY: And is that where you’re from? A different planet?\nACE: I’m from this time, more or less. Hex is from the future.\nALBERT: So you know what’s going to happen? If this is all in the past you?\nHEX: I’m afraid not. This isn’t my past.\nPEGGY: What does he mean, Albert?\nHEX: In the history we come from, there were all the uprisings in Eastern Europe, but the Soviet President was a guy called\nHEX: Gorbachev. His attitude was that if these people wanted out, he\nHEX: wasn’t gonna stand in their way.\nHEX: to\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nACE: And so the Soviet Union split up and they pulled down the Berlin Wall.\nALBERT: (INCREDULOUS) Pulled down the Berlin Wall?\nACE: Yes. That’s what should be happening right now.\nPEGGY: Have to say, I much prefer your version of history.\nALBERT: But if that’s what supposed to happen, then why isn’t it?\nACE: I don’t know.\nHEX: Something to do with Kryuchkov being in charge.\nPEGGY: (COUGHS) I’m sorry, Albert. Need a handkerchief.\nALBERT: Peggy... it’s alright, it doesn’t matter.\nPEGGY: My mouth... it’s blood. My gums are bleeding.\nHEX: One of the first symptoms of radiation sickness. All the time we spent in the inner refuge, it wasn’t enough. The radiation’s in here with us. (BEAT) We’ve all received a lethal dose.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP ON ALBERT WHEEZING IN HIS SLEEP AS ACE WASHES HER HANDS IN A BOWL OF WATER. )\nACE: How are they now?\nHEX: I can still feel Peggy’s pulse, but it’s weak. Albert’s having respiratory problems. How do they look to you? Ace?\nACE: I’m doing my best, the torch is dying on me. (BEAT) Their skin’s red, covered in blisters.\nHEX: They haven’t got long left. What about you?\nACE: Me?\nHEX: You don’t have to put on an act for me. What about you?\nACE: Well, I’ve looked better. Weirdest thing is that when I woke up there was a load of hair on my pillow. Let me tell you, the skinhead look doesn’t suit me.\nHEX: (LAUGHS) Wish I could see it. (BEAT) What time is it now?\nACE: About four o’clock.\nHEX: Morning or night?\nACE: Morning, I think.\nHEX: So we’ve been down here a week?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nACE: I suppose so.\nPEGGY: (WEAK) Where... Albert? Albert?\nACE: It’s alright, he’s right next to you.\nPEGGY: (WEAK) Who are you? Are you the nurse?\nACE: I’m Ace, remember.\nPEGGY: Water. Please. Water.\nACE: Here. Careful, drink it slowly.\nACE: It’s alright, Peggy. The Doctor will be here soon. He’1l save us, I know he will.\nHEX: He'd better get a move on, because in a couple more days, there won’t be anyone left to save.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: If the all-clear has not been sounded and anyone dies while you are in the fallout room, move the body to another room in the house.

That’s it, follow the sound of my voice, to me. Okay, you can put him down now.\nHEX: I can’t believe how knackered I am. My arms are killing me.\nACE: We'll go downstairs, get our energy back, then do Peggy.\nHEX: Okay, good plan. What’s it like outside?\nACE: Grey. Can’t see the sky, it’s all misted over. There’s a sort of ash over everything. Like it’s been snowing.\nHEX: Maybe it has. It’s freezing.\nACE: Yeah. And we thought it was cold in — (the)\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nHEX: Another attack.\nACE: No, it’s a single note. Hex, it’s the all-clear!\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: When there is no immediate danger of air attack or fall-out, an all-clear warning will sound and you may resume normal activities.\nHEX: Normal activities? They’ve gotta be joking.\nACE: Yeah. For all we know, we’re the only people left alive.\nHEX: Except whoever’s making all the radio announcements.\nACE: They’re all pre-recorded, that doesn’t mean anything.\nHEX: (REALISATION) Hang on a minute. Just before the attack, I thought all communications were knocked out.\nACE: Yeah. By an electromagnetic pulse.\nHEX: So how come we can hear these announcements? Where’s the radio?\nACE: The kitchen, I think. Here, I’1ll guide you.\nACE: The whole place has been gutted... except for the radio.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nHEX: But that’s impossible, the explosion couldn’t destroy everything else and leave it intact.\nACE: Then someone must’ve left it here.\nHEX: Who?\nACE: I don’t know. It must be running on battery power.\nACE: I don’t believe it.\nHEX: What is it?\nACE: There aren’t any batteries. It’s empty.\nHEX: But we heard it, we heard the voice of the announcer.\nACE: Hex. We were in the basement for nine days and it never occurred to any of us to notice that there was anything strange about the fact that the radio was still working.\nHEX: Well, we had other stuff to worry about.\nACE: For nine days? No. Something was preventing us from noticing.\nACE: And there’s something else. Listen.\nHEX: I can’t hear anything.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nACE: The wind’s stopped. Not even a breeze.\nHEX: Well it’s back now. (SHIVERS)\nACE: Yes.. but it’s changed. The wind was blowing into the house, through where the windows used to be.\nHEX: Yeah, I remember. (REALISES) It’s coming from the opposite direction.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: When there is no immediate danger of air attack or fall-out, an all-clear warning will sound and you may resume normal activities.\nHEX: What’s gone wrong with the radio?\nACE: Hex.

(GASPS IN SURPRISE)\nHEX: What is it?\nACE: Albert’s body. It’s gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nACE: Hex, careful, one step at a time. One more.\nHEX: We’re not alone down here.\nACE: No. It’s Albert and Peggy. They’re both asleep.\nHEX: So time’s gone back to a point when they were still alive.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: [If the all-clear has not been sounded and anyone dies while you are in the fallout room, move the body to another room in the house.

Need a handkerchief.\nALBERT: Peggy... it’s alright, it doesn’t matter. ]\nPEGGY: My mouth... it’s blood. My gums are bleeding.\nACE: Albert and Peggy... they’re moving about. Backwards. But they can’t see us. They’re like ghosts. Or long-exposure photographs.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nHEX: What was that?\nACE: The fall-out warning. And we’re back upstairs. In the kitchen.\nHEX: So now it’s just after the explosion.\nACE: The cooker, the microwave, they’re all sucking the smoke from the air. They’re all on fire, but the fire is returning them to\nACE: normal.. Hex, watch out!\nHEX: Watch out for what?\nACE: (OVER ROAR)\nACE: All the fires have gone out.. the glass is reforming in the windows... outside, the blast cloud, it’s rushing away from us...\nHEX: It’s over?\nACE: Not quite.. (BEAT) A light, brighter than the sun...\nHEX: (GASPS) I can see. I can see again!\nACE: And listen. Even the birds are back.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nHEX: Never mind the birds, I thought I was blinded for life! It’s a bloomin’ miracle! (BEAT) Hey, the clouds, there’s something weird about the clouds.\nACE: Time’s still going backwards. And getting faster.\nACE: (FX: IN B/G, ALBERT AND PEGGY BACKWARDS DIALOGUE FROM SCENE 18,\nSPED UP: )\nALBERT: Have they gone, dear?\nPEGGY: They’re just leaving the garage now. Pity. I liked them.\nHEX: Albert and Peggy... they’re back.\nACE: Removing the whitewash from the windows, returning the water to the taps.\nHEX: Carrying boxes of earth out of the basement and shovelling them\nHEX: back into the ground —\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nACE: We're back. Back at the point where we first arrived.\nHEX: What the hell is going on here?\nACE: Isn’t it obvious? We’re stuck in a time-loop.\nHEX: No. Wait. If this is when we first arrived... then the TARDIS should still be here!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nACE: Nope. No sign of it.\nHEX: Maybe we’ve gone back too far. Maybe we haven’t landed yet.\nACE: Yeah. Or when the TARDIS vanished, it left this place, never return.\nHEX: This place?\nACE: Wherever we are, Hex, this isn’t Earth. Not our Earth.\nHEX: Then what is it?\nALBERT: (CALLING) Hello! Can I help you?\nHEX: It’s all happening over again, like when we first got here.\nACE: Then that settles it. The TARDIS isn’t coming back.\nALBERT: You mean that Police Box of yours? The one you arrived in?\nACE: Albert. You remember? You know who we are?\nALBERT: Of course I know who you are. Just because we’ve gone back to square one, that doesn’t mean we forget.\nALBERT: to\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 69\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Your first priority is to make a fall-out room to protect you from radioactive fall-out.

If you have a basement, use that.\nANNOUNCER: (FX: CLOSING THEME — SINISTER MOOG NOTE, SERIES OF SINISTER MOOG BLEEPS, ANOTHER SINISTER MOOG NOTE. ) ]\nPEGGY: Yes. We go through the same ten days, over and over again.\nHEX: The same ten days?\nALBERT: The day before the war, then the explosion, then nine days in the fall-out room. And then we die.\nPEGGY: Then we go back to the start and do it all again.\nACE: Then why didn’t you tell us? Why didn’t you warn us that would happen?\nPEGGY: Well, there didn’t seem to be any point, to be honest.\nALBERT: After all, you’d be finding out for yourselves soon enough.\nHEX: I thought I was permanently blinded! I thought we were all dying! And you didn’t want to spoil the surprise!\nPEGGY: How about a cup of tea? You can do your own milk and sugar.\nHEX: I don’t want tea. I want answers.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 70\nALBERT: Answers?\nACE: Where are we? What’s going on here?\nPEGGY: Well, I suppose you would say we’re in a kind of prison.\nHEX: A prison?\nACE: But what is it? Some sort of virtual reality?\nALBERT: It’s hard to explain. It’s like a dimension, all of itself.\nACE: A parallel universe?\nALBERT: Not a whole universe. Not even a whole planet.\nPEGGY: Just us, and our house, and everything you see around us, and then, only for ten days.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Use thick, dense materials to make the walls of your fall-out room thicker to protect against radiation. [Use bricks, concrete blocks, timber, or boxes of earth and sand. ]\nHEX: Okay. If this is a prison, then why are you here?\nPEGGY: Well, that’s just it, dear. We don’t know.\nALBERT: Haven’t the faintest.\nACE: You must have some idea. Who made this place? Who put you here?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 71\nPEGGY: It’s rather hard to say. It was all so long ago.\nHEX: Try.\nALBERT: All I can remember was that it was evil. Utterly evil.\nPEGGY: Yes. It would have to have been, for it to have created this place and put us here.\nACE: But this evil, what was it? Some kind of creature?\nALBERT: Yes, I think so.\nHEX: Then what did it look like?\nPEGGY: It was all so long ago.\nACE: You keep saying that. How long have you been here?\nALBERT: Oh, it must be... a hundred years.\nPEGGY: Yes, a hundred years at least. If not two.\nACE: This “evil” decided you should be forced to relive World War Three for a whole century?\nPEGGY: Oh, no.\nALBERT: No. We’re to be forced to relive World War Three forever.\nHEX: Forever?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nPEGGY: For all eternity. Round and round we go.\nACE: But there must be some way out. There must be.\nALBERT: If there is, we’ve never managed to find it.\nPEGGY: We were rather hoping you would tell us.\nHEX: How we are supposed to know? We just landed here by accident, we’re not even meant to be here.\nALBERT: Can’t you leave the same way you came?\nACE: No. The TARDIS is gone.\nHEX: And we don’t have any way of getting it back.\nPEGGY: Oh dear. Then it rather looks like you’re going to be trapped here with us, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 73\nALBERT: All those boxes are to go along the living room wall, same side as the stairs.\nACE: Hex. We can’t just go along with things.\nHEX: Then what do you suggest?\nACE: Think. What would the Doctor do if he was here?\nHEX: I don’t know. He’d probably be working to some incredibly complicated plan, which he can’t tell us about because it all depended on us doing his dirty work without realising.\nACE: Hex.\nHEX: Maybe that’s what he’s done here. Maybe this another of his plans, and we just haven’t been let in on the secret yet.\nACE: There’s no need to be like that.\nHEX: Like what? The Doctor doesn’t trust us, never has.\nACE: He does.\nHEX: No, he trusts us to do what he wants, he doesn’t trust us enough to tell us what he’s up to.\nALBERT: Hex, lad, are you going to help me with these boxes or not?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nHEX: Yeah, yeah, in a minute.\nACE: No. Wait. Maybe that’s it. Maybe if we do things differently, we can break out of the time loop.\nALBERT: Won't do any good, my dear. You can’t stop the bomb. Time marches on, no matter what.\nACE: Well, it’s gotta be worth a try. Hex?\nHEX: Yeah, I’m in. So what do we do?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 75\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: You must also prepare the rest of your house to limit the damage from heat and blast. [Remove anything flammable such as net curtains, newspapers and magazines. You should then coat the windows with diluted white paint, to reflect the heat flash. ]\nANNOUNCER: (FX: OVER THIS, PAINT BEING THROWN ONTO DOORSTEP WITH A BIG SPLASH AND DIALOGUE. )\nPEGGY: Ace. What are you doing?\nACE: Getting rid of the paint. Now you can’t whitewash the windows.\nPEGGY: But the radio says —\nACE: You don’t always have to do what the radio tells you, you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 76\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Inside your fallout room you should prepare an inner refuge, [to give you extra protection during the first two days after the attack, when the danger from radiation is most critical. ]\nALBERT: Hex, I spent all morning filling those boxes.\nHEX: And now I’m emptying them.\nALBERT: But if we don’t prepare the inner refuge —\nHEX: What? What difference will it make?\nALBERT: We'll die.\nHEX: You’re gonna die anyway, so why not live a little first?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 77\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: You will need to store enough food and water in your fallout room for each member of your family [for fourteen days. Choose foods which can be eaten cold and which are tinned or well-wrapped. Don’t forget to make sure you have a tin opener in your inner refuge. ]\nPEGGY: What are you trying to do?\nACE: Mess things up. Throw out the system. Stick a spanner in the works.\nPEGGY: You don’t think we haven’t already tried that?\nACE: Well maybe you didn’t try hard enough.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO) If an attack with nuclear weapons is expected, you will hear the following sound.\nANNOUNCER: [ (FX: RISING AND FALLING SIREN)\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: If you are at home when you hear this sound, turn off the gas and electricity at the mains, and go to your fallout room. If you are not at home, but can get there within two minutes, do so. Otherwise take cover at your place of work. If you are in the open, take cover in the nearest building. If you cannot reach a building, lie flat on the ground and cover your head and your hands. ]\nPEGGY: The gas and the electric! I’d almost forgot!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 78\nACE: You don’t have to do what the radio — (REALISES) Hang on. This announcement. It’s being played earlier than it was last time.\nPEGGY: What do you mean?\nACE: Events are speeding up.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nACE: Hex. I think I’ve got it. What we’re doing, it’s affecting the radio broadcasts somehow. By trying to break the pattern, we’re making things happen faster.\nHEX: How?\nACE: The radio isn’t just telling us what’s going to happen. It’s\nACE: making things happen. Isn’t that right, Peggy?\nPEGGY: It won’t make any difference. There’s nothing you can do.\nACE: Oh, we’ll see about that.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 80\nHEX: How do you suggest we stop it? We can’t take out the batteries, it doesn’t have any batteries.\nACE: Then we smash it to pieces.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO, FROM KITCHEN)\nANNOUNCER: Air attack warning. [Go to your fallout room or take shelter. Do not panic. Stay calm. This is not a test. Repeat. (MESSAGE REPEATS IN B/G) ]\nACE: It’s no good, it won’t break.\nHEX: Can’t you unscrew it or something?\nACE: Give me a knife. (SHE TRIES) Yes, I think I’ve got it —\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO, PREVIEW OF SCENE 53 DIALOGUE) Nothing you can do can alter or delay the course of events. What has happened, will happen, must happen.\nHEX: (WHISPER) The Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO, PREVIEW OF SCENE 53 DIALOGUE)\nDOCTOR: The time loop will continue until I return and deactivate it. Until then, you must remain here and learn what it is to be human. Find out how it feels to suffer as a human suffers, find out how it feels to fear as a human fears. Find out what it feels like to die.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 81"

Can I help you?\nDOCTOR: Quite possibly. I’m after a little information.\nALBERT: Information?\nDOCTOR: In an entirely official capacity, on behalf of her Majesty’s Government.\nALBERT: Right. Which is why you’ve brought a Police Box with you?\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. Don’t worry, it’s purely temporary.\nALBERT: Haven’t seen one of these for years. But shouldn’t it be blue? I don’t remember seeing a black one before.\nDOCTOR: It’s a new thing. So, do you live near here, Mister —\nALBERT: Albert Marsden. We’re the cottage just up the road.\nDOCTOR: The cottage just up the road?

It’s a man from the government. Mister... er —\nDOCTOR: Doctor. Doctor John Smith.\nALBERT: Doctor Smith, this is my wife, Margaret.\nPEGGY: Please, call me Peggy. Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor Smith?\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind of you. I’ve had rather a long journey.\nALBERT: Yes, I’ve heard the traffic’s bad, the radio said they’ve had to close all the motorways to non-essential vehicles.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t come by motorway.

What can I do for you?\nDOCTOR: I want to talk to you about the forthcoming nuclear war.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 84\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Your first priority is to make a fall-out room [to protect you from radioactive fall-out. This should be the room in your home which is furthest away from the exterior walls and roof.

You can do your own milk and sugar.\nALBERT: So we just have to stock up on water, whitewash the windows, and we’re done.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Because some white paint will make all the difference.\nALBERT: So you can tell them in the government, we’ll be ready for it, whatever happens.\nDOCTOR: Yes. That’s the bulldog spirit. Keep calm and carry on! Fight for king and country, and keep the British end up! Because it’1ll all be over by Christmas.\nPEGGY: I don’t understand.\nALBERT: I think he’s making fun of us.\nDOCTOR: Mr and Mrs Marsden. I have nothing but admiration for your courage and your kind-heartedness...\nALBERT: Just doing our bit.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR: . but I’m afraid it won’t be enough to save you.\nDOCTOR: [ANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nDOCTOR: Use thick, dense materials to make the walls of your fall-out room thicker to protect against radiation. Use bricks, concrete blocks, timber, or boxes of earth and sand. ]\nALBERT: Now, look here —\nDOCTOR: You think a few boxes of earth will protect you from the radiation of a hydrogen bomb? And even if you do survive, what do you think the world will be like after a nuclear war? Those killed by the bombs would be considered the lucky ones.\nALBERT: You sound like one of those people on the television —\nPEGGY: - the ones they had arrested.\nDOCTOR: Ten thousand years of human civilisation, wiped out in an instant. Every play by Shakespeare, incinerated. Every painting by Michelangelo, burned. Every album by the Beatles, obliterated. Every achievement of the human race, every hope, every dream, every memory... reduced to ashes.\nALBERT: You can’t be sure of this.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I can. Because I’ve already seen it happen.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 86\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: If you are at home when you hear this sound, turn off the gas and electricity at the mains, and go to your fallout room. If you are not at home, but can get there within two minutes, do so. Otherwise take cover at your place of work. [If you are in the open, take cover in the nearest building. If you cannot reach a building, lie flat on the ground and cover your head and your hands. ]\nALBERT: Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: These newspapers. You don’t mind if I borrow them, do you?\nALBERT: What you said back there, about already seeing it happen? What did you mean?\nDOCTOR: It’s perfectly simple. I travel in time.\nALBERT: What?\nDOCTOR: That’s why I’m here. Something has interfered with the course of history. So I have to find the source of that interference, and prevent the forthcoming war from taking place.\nALBERT: But they’d never really do it, would they? They’d never really press the button.\nDOCTOR: Albert Marsden.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nALBERT: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I suggest you take cover.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 88\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO, FROM KITCHEN)\nANNOUNCER: Air attack warning.

But before you kill me, don’t you want to know why I’m here?\nALBERT: Why are you here?\nDOCTOR: To talk.\nALBERT: To talk? (LAUGH) You have two minutes, comrade.\nDOCTOR: Two minutes until you and millions of your countrymen die.\nALBERT: That is why we’ve launched a counter-attack on those responsible.\nDOCTOR: And in so doing, you consign millions more innocent lives to oblivion. You sign the death warrant of the human race.\nALBERT: I have my orders.\nDOCTOR: And orders must be obeyed. But nobody will court-martial you if you press the abort button. The responsibility is yours, and yours alone.\nALBERT: It is not my decision. The General Secretary has commanded.\nDOCTOR: The General Secretary will be dead in one minute’s time, along with the rest of your country and your revolution.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nALBERT: The Americans attacked first. They knew we would retaliate.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t have to. They will suffer long and hard for what they’ve done, but at least life will continue. Isn’t it better to die in the name of comradeship than to die in the name of revenge?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nALBERT: (AMERICAN ACCENT) (OFF) What’s the situation in Berlin? People! I need an update from Berlin!\nPEGGY: (AMERICAN ACCENT) (ALOUD) This is a level one readiness alert. Prepare for missile launch.\nDOCTOR: You think that likely, General Mitchell?\nPEGGY: (TURNING TO DOCTOR) Unless we hear from the Soviets in the next few minutes, I’d say it was a certainty. (BEAT) Who are you, anyway?\nDOCTOR: I’m here with the British ambassador. I can show you my pass if you like.\nPEGGY: You couldn’t be in the war room if you didn’t have a pass.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. But I’m a little out of the loop due to the news blackout, so if you could fill me in?\nPEGGY: (SIGH) As you know, three days ago we used a tactical nuclear weapon on the Soviet base at Helmstedt. Since then, they have continued to build up forces on the Inner German border. Despite all diplomatic efforts, they have ignored our final ultimatum to withdraw from West Berlin and East Germany.\nDOCTOR: And the ultimatum runs out in a few minutes?\nPEGGY: Ninety seconds and counting.\nDOCTOR: And then you intend to declare war.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nPEGGY: It’s only a war if we give them a chance to fight back. Our intelligence reports that a pre-emptive nuclear strike will take out any capacity they have for retaliation.\nDOCTOR: Then your intelligence is wrong. Their missiles will be in the air long before your missiles hit their targets.\nPEGGY: The point is, we’ve drawn a line in the sand. If we don’t act now, it will be message to the whole world that we’re not prepared to follow through on our warnings.\nDOCTOR: You have to show them you mean business.\nPEGGY: Exactly. The President can’t just sit back and do nothing in the face of enemy aggression. The people would never forgive him.\nDOCTOR: He’s backed himself into a corner. Frightened of losing face.\nPEGGY: That’s another point of view. History will decide which of us is right.\nDOCTOR: If you give the order to launch those missiles, there won’t be any more history.\nALBERT: (AMERICAN ACCENT) (APPROACHING FROM OFF) General Mitchell. It’s time.\nPEGGY: Twelve o’clock in Berlin. Any word from the Soviet ambassador?\nALBERT: No, ma’am. Satellites show no signs of Soviet retreat.\nPEGGY: Captain Sutherland. Commence missile launch.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nALBERT: Yes, ma’am. (FX: CLICKS HEELS, TURNS) (TO GENERALS, OFF) We are green to go. Commence missile launch. [Repeat, commence missile launch. This is not a drill, this is the real deal! ]\nDOCTOR: Don’t you have to wait for authorisation from the President?\nPEGGY: We already have authorisation. The President’s orders were perfectly clear.\nDOCTOR: But you could stop this. You could wait for confirmation. You could at least check!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WE’RE AT THE TOP OF A WATCHTOWER — WIND, RAIN. A DEMONSTRATION FAR BELOW)\nPROTESTORS: (CHANTING, OFF) Wir wollen raus! Wir wollen raus! Wir wollen raus! [MEANING: ‘WE WANT OUT!’ CONTINUES SPORADICALLY UNDER: ]\nALBERT: (GERMAN ACCENT) Halt! Identify yourself.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Major Johann Schmidt. Inspection from Politburo.\nALBERT: A watch-tower inspection? Tonight of all nights?\nDOCTOR: Particularly tonight of all nights. Anything to report, Sergeant Schumacher?\nALBERT: Well, sir, the demonstration in Alexanderplatz is growing. They’re saying there’s over a hundred thousand people.\nDOCTOR: Are they indeed? What about along the wall?\nALBERT: It’s been as quiet as the grave, sir.\nANNOUNCER: (GERMAN ACCENT, VIA RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: Calling all border guards, all border guards. New orders, direct from General Secretary Kryuchkov. The crowd are to be ordered to disperse. If they refuse, they are to be shot. They have been declared enemies of the revolution.\nALBERT: (QUIET) Enemies of the revolution...\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter, Sergeant? Do I detect some qualms about turning your gun on your own people?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nALBERT: N-no, sir. If they are the orders of the General Secretary.\nDOCTOR: But what if I was to tell you what the consequences of those orders will be?\nALBERT: I don’t understand, sir.\nDOCTOR: Tonight should have marked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Bloc. Instead it will mark the first step towards a nuclear war.\nALBERT: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: Because that’s why I’m here. Following the threads of cause and effect back to the start.\nALBERT: Which is tonight?\nDOCTOR: Tonight the future hangs in the balance. One stray shot could be the snowflake that sets off the avalanche.\nALBERT: You’re not from the Politburo. Who are you?\nDOCTOR: The ghost of Christmas yet to come. (BEAT) Listen, Sergeant Schumacher. It’s not too late. Open up the border crossings.\nALBERT: But if I do that, I will be executed, as a traitor.\nDOCTOR: You would be a hero. You know that the demonstrators are not the enemies of the revolution. Do you want their blood on your hands?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nPEGGY: (RUSSIAN ACCENT) So, Commissar Leonov. Comrade Chernenko is dead, and it is time for the central committee to elect a new leader.\nALBERT: (AS COMMISSAR LEONOV) (RUSSIAN ACCENT) History records they will choose Gorbachev, with the only opposition from Romanov.\nPEGGY: But history can be rewritten. We can influence every member of the committee in turn, make them select a new candidate.\nALBERT: (AS COMMISSAR LEONOV) Vladimir Kryuchkov?\nPEGGY: He is the one most suitable for our purposes. The most paranoid, the most belligerent, the most weak-minded.\nALBERT: (AS COMMISSAR LEONOV) Then Kryuchkov it will be.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be so sure of that if I was you.\nPEGGY: Who are you? What are you doing here? This is a private meeting —\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. And, like you, I am not of this world.\nPEGGY: (NO MORE ACCENT — ‘NATURAL’ ALIEN VOICE, SAME SPECIES EFFECT AS MOLOCH IN PART FOUR, ONLY THINNER) So. You have come to stop us?\nDOCTOR: Something like that.\nALBERT: (NO MORE ACCENT — ‘NATURAL’ ALIEN VOICE, AS ABOVE) You, against us? Any attempt you make would be futile.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: Quite probably. You could kill me in an instant. But why bother, as I pose no threat? Now, let’s see. You intend to divert the course of history to cause the destruction of all life on Earth. Which leads me to wonder three things.\nALBERT: (ALIEN) Really?\nDOCTOR: Firstly, who are you? Changing history is beyond the capacity of most species — so you are Elder Gods, am I right?\nALBERT: (ALIEN) You are correct.\nDOCTOR: Which leads me onto my second question. Why destroy the Earth?\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) Because we can.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought there wouldn’t be a good reason, there never is with you. Chaos for chaos’ sake. One last question. How?\nALBERT: (ALIEN) Isn’t it obvious?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know you have the ability to travel through time and possess the bodies of human beings. That’s pretty much par for the course. But how to change history without creating a temporal paradox...?\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) It is perfectly simple. We preserve the planet’s original time line within a pocket universe.\nDOCTOR: Of course! Very ingenious!\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) I’m so pleased that you’re impressed.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid that when you asked me if I’d come to try and stop you, I didn’t quite tell the truth.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nALBERT: (ALIEN) No?\nDOCTOR: No. I’m not here to try to stop you. I’m here to tell you I already have.\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) That is quite impossible.\nDOCTOR: I’m so pleased that you’re impressed. But it wasn’t that difficult. For your plan to succeed, you would have to directly influence events at several key points. I've been to the future and made sure, at each of those points, that history continues on its established path.\nALBERT: (ALIEN) You expect us to believe that?\nDOCTOR: I’ve already met both of you, several times, in the future. At the Berlin Wall, in the White House War Room, in a missile launch silo in Plokstine...\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) You're bluffing.\nDOCTOR: Oh? Well, if you’re sure, you keep on doing what you doing.\nALBERT: (ALIEN) There is a simple way of verifying your story.\nDOCTOR: There is?\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) We can go forward and look!\nDOCTOR: You have a time machine?\nPEGGY: (ALIEN) We have no need of a ‘time machine’.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nALBERT: (ALIEN) We can simply transport our minds into the bodies of some humans in the future.\nALBERT: (FX: ECHO ON ‘THE FUTURE’.

[This should be the room in your home which is furthest away from the exterior walls and roof. If you have a basement, use that.\nANNOUNCER: (FX: CLOSING THEME — SINISTER MOOG NOTE, SERIES OF SINISTER MOOG BLEEPS, ANOTHER SINISTER MOOG NOTE.) ]\nPEGGY: (NORMAL VOICE FROM HERE) You see, Doctor? The morning of the last day before the war.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It seems I must have miscalculated.\nALBERT: (NORMAL VOICE FROM HERE) So we are successful in diverting the course of history.\nPEGGY: Resulting in the absolute destruction of the planet Earth.\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) Except, of course, this isn’t the Earth.\nPEGGY: What?\nDOCTOR: You were right, I was bluffing. I just had to make you doubt things enough so that you’d want to go and check.\nALBERT: What do you mean, this isn’t the Earth?\nDOCTOR: This is the Earth that resulted from your interference. Well, not the entire planet. Just the surrounding five miles or so. All sealed within a pocket dimension.\nPEGGY: Doctor, what have you done?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR: What have I done? I’ve caught you in a trap of your own making. Two future timelines — all I had to do was make sure that you ended up in the wrong one.\nALBERT: You cannot hope to imprison us.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I’m afraid you won’t be able to time-travel out of here. You’re no longer Elder Gods. You’re human beings.\nPEGGY: Human beings?\nALBERT: These mortal bodies we inhabit... who are they?\nDOCTOR: A delightful couple I met called Albert and Peggy Marsden. Well,\nDOCTOR: not the real Albert and Peggy. The real Albert and Peggy are safe and sound in a version of history where a nuclear war never took\nDOCTOR: place.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FLASHBACK EFFECT — LOOKING THROUGH A DISTORTING WINDOW, WE HEAR ANOTHER ALBERT AND PEGGY, ALBERT DIGGING IN THE GARDEN. )\nPEGGY: Albert. Cup of tea.\nALBERT: (STRAIGHTENING UP) Aw, thanks love. I’ve just finished. (DRINKS TEA) With any luck, we’1ll have roses all along the edge of the lawn, come the spring.\nPEGGY: Can you hear that? Sounds like our Raymond’s car.\nALBERT: Yes. They’re early — you’1ll have to make another pot —\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: No, you’re looking out through the eyes of the alternative Albert and Peggy from the timeline you created.\nALBERT: But why?\nDOCTOR: Why? To give you a chance to walk in their shoes.\nPEGGY: You are condemning us both to death.\nDOCTOR: Not quite. I’ve time-looped this pocket dimension so, no matter what happens, you always end up back at square one. Nothing you do can alter or delay the course of events. What has happened, will happen, must happen.\nPEGGY: You intend to trap us here forever? For all eternity?\nDOCTOR: The time loop will continue until I return and deactivate it. Until then, you must remain here and learn what it is to be human. Find out how it feels to suffer as a human suffers, find out how it feels to fear as a human fears. Find out what it feels like to die.\nPEGGY: How long must we wait?\nDOCTOR: However long it takes. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have two friends who’ll be beginning to wonder where I’ve got to.\nDOCTOR: I’d start work on that fall-out shelter if I were you.\nPEGGY: You cannot leave us, Doctor. You cannot!\nALBERT: Have you no mercy? No compassion? No pity?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: PEGGY & ALBERT: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO, FROM KITCHEN)\nANNOUNCER: Air attack warning.

That makes sense.\nACE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nHEX: This is just his style, isn’t it? It’s not enough to defeat the bad guys, he has to punish them.\nACE: What’s wrong with that?\nHEX: Who died and put him in charge? What right does he have to hand out judgement?\nACE: You make him sound like a monster.\nHEX: No, it’s just that sometimes he gets so close to the monsters it’s hard to tell them apart.\nALBERT: Peggy, we have to go down into the basement. Now.\nPEGGY: Alright, no need to raise your voice. What about you two?\nACE: What difference does it make? We know we can’t die here.\nALBERT: Just because you’1ll be brought back to life doesn’t mean you won’t suffer.\nPEGGY: You don’t want to stay up here, love. I did it once, and believe\nPEGGY: me, being burned alive isn’t much fun.\nACE: Alright, you’ve convinced me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BASEMENT DOOR OPENED.

Make it stop.\nALBERT: Hush, it’s all right dear. I’m with you.\nPEGGY: (IN B/G) Albert. I’m shaking.\nALBERT: (IN B/G) That’s just the shock, Peggy love, that’s all.\nACE: (OVER PREVIOUS TWO LINES) I still can’t believe the Doctor’s behind all this.\nPEGGY: The Doctor? Your friend?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nHEX: Yes. We think he’s the one who created the time loop.\nACE: He must have had a good reason for it. So maybe you two should start talking.\nPEGGY: You think he imprisoned us here?\nALBERT: We didn’t even know about the Doctor until you mentioned him.\nACE: Yeah, so you Say.\nHEX: Ace, what are you doing?\nACE: There’s no point in hanging around down here.\nHEX: But you can’t go upstairs. The radiation —\nACE: Bring it on, that’s what I say. Are you coming or not?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 109\nHEX: Woah. The blast’s burned everything to a crisp.\nACE: Just like before.\nHEX: What are you looking for?\nACE: I just want a chance to think, without those two around.\nHEX: Albert and Peggy?\nACE: If that’s their real names. What do we really know about them? Only what they’ve told us.\nHEX: And that they’re human.\nACE: No. You heard the Doctor’s message. Whoever this prison is for, he designed it to make them feel what it’s like to be human. Maybe he Doctor made them human.\nHEX: The fall-out warning.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: After a nuclear explosion there will be a cloud of deadly dust called fall-out. [It can be carried by winds for hundreds of miles before falling to the ground. The radiation from this dust cannot be seen, felt or smelt but exposure to it, even for a few minutes, can cause sickness and even death. ]\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 110\nHEX: But if they weren’t human, what were they?\nACE: I don’t know. But there must be some way of finding out.\nHEX: The radio?\nACE: The Doctor made a recording deliberately. Maybe we didn’t hear all of it.\nHEX: Knife?\nACE: Thanks. If I can just force it open —\nACE: (FX: SHE DOES SO. AS SHE DOES, THE DOCTOR’S LINE FROM SCENE 53 PLAYS IN B/G.)\nDOCTOR: This is the Earth that resulted from your interference.

They are close to discovering the truth.\nALBERT: It is of no importance. What can they do to harm us?\nPEGGY: You think the Doctor will come for them? You don’t think he might abandon his friends, rather than release us?\nALBERT: There is always that possibility. It will be interesting to find out.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: [However long it takes.] Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have two friends who’ll be beginning to wonder where I’ve got to.\nDOCTOR: I’d start work on that fall-out shelter if I were you.\nHEX: You were right. Elder Gods!\nACE: The Doctor mentioned his two friends. He must’ve done all this while we were sleeping. But why make a recording?\nHEX: More to the point, where is he now? Why hasn’t he turned up like he promised?\nACE: Maybe Albert and Peggy haven’t been here for long enough.\nHEX: Ace, they’ve been here for a hundred years. D’you think the Doctor would inflict that on even his worst enemies?\nACE: No, You’re right. Something must have happened to him.\nHEX: Did you hear that?\nACE: Yes. Time’s going backwards. But it shouldn’t be happening yet, should it?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 113\nPEGGY: Yes, my dear. You see, while we might not be able to escape the time-loop, we have learned how to control it.\nALBERT: Backwards and forwards, forwards and backwards.\nPEGGY: Round and round we go. (LAUGHS)\nHEX: What do you want? What have you brought us here?\nPEGGY: Haven’t you worked it out? We weren’t trying to bring you here.\nALBERT: We were trying to bring the Doctor here.\nACE: Bet you were disappointed when we walked out of the TARDIS instead.\nPEGGY: As disappointed as you were when, a few short moments later, the TARDIS departed without you.\nALBERT: The Doctor choosing to abandon his companions, just as he abandoned us, a hundred years ago.\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO, FROM KITCHEN)\nANNOUNCER: Air attack warning. Go to your fallout room or take shelter. Do not panic. Stay calm. This is not a test. Repeat. (MESSAGE REPEATS IN B/G)\nACE: The Doctor wouldn’t leave us here to die.

Call him.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 114\nHEX: What do you mean, call him?\nALBERT: He must have given some means of summoning the TARDIS?\nHEX: Don’t you think if he had we would have done it already?\nPEGGY: Sounds to me like he wanted to be rid of you.\nACE: If the Doctor knew we were here, he’d come and find us, I know he would.\nPEGGY: Then call him.\nACE: We can’t! We don’t have any way of contacting him.\nALBERT: You do. The radio.\nHEX: The radio?\nALBERT: You can use it to send him a message.\nACE: No. If that’s what you want us to do, we won’t help you.\nPEGGY: We thought you might say that.\nPEGGY: (FX: IN B/G, SIREN AND ANNOUNCEMENT FROM SCENES 20/21 PAUSES,\nTHEN BEGINS TO GO FORWARD: )\nANNOUNCER: (RADIO) Air attack warning.

We're trapped inside this pocket dimension thing with a couple of former Elder Gods. Please... wherever you are, come and get us out of here...\nALBERT: Oh dear. It seems he doesn’t want to answer.\nPEGGY: I can’t hear the sound of his TARDIS. Can you?\nALBERT: No. Then wherever the Doctor is, either he doesn’t know you’re here, or he doesn’t care.\nACE: If the Doctor heard that message, he would be on his way.\nHEX: Unless you were right, and something’s happened to him.\nPEGGY: Either way, he’s not coming to save you.\nALBERT: And there’s no-one else who can.\nANNOUNCER: (VIA RADIO)\nANNOUNCER: If an attack with nuclear weapons is expected, you will hear the following sound.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ANNOUNCEMENT STUTTERS LIKE A SCRATCHED CD.

Yeah, what Ace said.\nALBERT: Then so be it. Let there be light!\nACE: The bomb —\nPEGGY: (LAUGHS) Remember not to look, or you’1ll go blind!\nHEX: You’re making this happen.\nALBERT: Of course.

Where are you? We cannot see you.\nMOLOCH: I stand on the threshold of this dimension. The integrity of this realm is weak. The forces preserving it have decayed over the centuries.\nPEGGY: We know. That is how we have gained control over it, using the power of our will.\nMOLOCH: Were it not for this decay, I would not have been able to find you.

You don’t think they’ve already gone?\nACE: And not gloat first? That’s what these Elder Gods live for, the chance to show off how clever they are in front of lesser races.\nHEX: Like the Doctor.\nACE: What is your problem, Hex?\nHEX: My problem with the Doctor? Apart from what happened to my mam, being lied to, and being treated like some kind of fall guy?\nACE: You could always ask him to take you home.\nHEX: And where would that be, exactly? (BEAT) It’s not that I want to go, it’s just, well, the Doctor. Don’t you think that he’s different, from how he used to be?\nACE: Different how?\nHEX: Keeping more secrets. I mean, he only ever used to tell us half of what was going on, but now he doesn’t even do that.\nACE: You get used to it.\nACE: Radio’s still broken.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 124\nHEX: And he’s been getting more extreme. It’s like... it’s like there’s something going on, something bad he won’t tell us about, and he’s starting to get desperate.\nACE: The Doctor will have a plan. He always has a plan. Whenever I’ve been in trouble, he’s always come through for me.\nHEX: Until now.\nACE: No. There’s only one reason why he’s not here and that’s because he’s in as much trouble as we are. So now it’s time for us to come through for him.\nHEX: The fall-out warning.\nACE: Yes. Come on, let’s get some fresh air.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nALBERT: Hex. And Ace. So glad you could join us.\nACE: See what I mean, Hex.

That a prison of the Doctor’s making should incarcerate his own companions.\nACE: You won’t get away with this.\nHEX: The Doctor will find us. Even if we have to wait a hundred years.\nPEGGY: Unfortunately, you will not have that opportunity.\nACE: What do you mean?\nALBERT: The forces that sustain this realm have grown weak. In our absence it will not exist for more than a few hours.\nPEGGY: And then it, and everything inside it, will collapse into a Singularity.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 126\nACE: You sure you don’t want to stick around for that?\nALBERT: No. We have other places to be. Other times.\nPEGGY: Goodbye. And thank you, to you both. If it were not for you, we'd still be trapped here...\nALBERT: My Lord Moloch. It is time.\nMOLOCH: Then let us begin.\nACE: No. You can’t force us to do this.\nMOLOCH: There is no need. You will acquiesce willingly.\nHEX: Er, no, I don’t think so.\nMOLOCH: You. The girl who calls herself Ace. You will submit. Or I will kill the boy Hex.\nACE: Go ahead.\nMOLOCH: And you, the boy who calls himself Hex. You will submit. Or I will kill the girl Ace.\nHEX: Won’t work. We’d both rather die than submit to you.\nMOLOCH: You may say that. But I can see the truth in your mind. Neither of you are prepared to see the other die.\nACE: Yeah? Try us.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nMOLOCH: Very well. My children. Kill the girl, Ace.\nALBERT: As you command, my lord.\nACE: Guess you’re not thinking of digging over your spuds with that?\nHEX: Alright, alright — stop. Please.\nMOLOCH: Then you have a simple choice. Submit. Or she will die.\nHEX: Then... Ace, I’m sorry —\nACE: What have you done? What have you done with him?\nMOLOCH: He is now part of this realm. Now you have a choice. You may either remain here with him or you can leave.\nACE: Thanks but no thanks.

The voice on the radio controls everything that happens here. It gives a warning about fall-out and —\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 132\nACE: And the fall-out starts.\nHEX: I get that, yeah, but how does that help us?\nACE: Look, if the voice on the radio wants us to stay downstairs maybe that’s because —\nHEX: - there’s something out here it doesn’t want us to find.\nACE: Exactly. So whatever it tells us to do, we do the opposite.\nDOCTOR: (RADIO)\nDOCTOR: The first two days will be the most dangerous. Remain within your inner refuge, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.

We still don’t know how Albert and Peggy managed to bring it here.\nHEX: Well, maybe they had some special powers.\nACE: No. The Doctor made them human, he wouldn’t leave them with the ability to drag the TARDIS off-course.\nHEX: Then how do you think they did it?\nACE: What were they doing, when we first arrived?\nHEX: They were just behaving as normal.\nACE: Of course! That must be it. Hex. The Doctor set up this place to teach them what it is to be human, right?\nHEX: Yeah, so?\nACE: So how would he know when they’d learned their lesson?\nHEX: I don’t know.\nACE: He’d know because they’d be acting as though they were human.\nHEX: You mean, whoever is in this prison goes around and around until they do all the same things that the real Albert and Peggy did.\nACE: We've been getting it the wrong way around. We’ve been trying to resist the pattern, when we should have been trying to follow it!\nHEX: I get it. Like Groundhog Day! It keeps repeating, until Bill Murray gets it right. And then...\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 144\nACE: It brings the TARDIS here.\nHEX: That’s why the Doctor didn’t tell them how long they’d be imprisoned here. He didn’t know how long it would take.\nACE: So if we go along with the pattern, if we follow it exactly, this place will summon the TARDIS.\nHEX: But Albert and Peggy were stuck here for a hundred years, they had a whole century to get it right. We only have a few hours.\nACE: Yes, but we have a head start.\nHEX: We do?\nACE: We do. Because we already know what it’s like to be human.\nDOCTOR: (RADIO)\nDOCTOR: When there is no immediate danger of air attack or fall-out, an all-clear warning will sound and you may resume normal activities.\nDOCTOR: (FX: RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS — THEN REWINDS.

I think I can hear his car.\nHEX: It’s alright love, I’m here beside you.\nACE: Oh my lord. So this is it, Albert.\nHEX: (STRAIGHTENING UP) Aw, thanks love. (DRINKS) Hits the spot.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 149\nACE: Albert. Cup of tea.\nACE: (FX: HEX TAKES TEA, DRINKS. A QUIET WHOOSH OF REALISATION AS IN SCENE 66.)\nHEX: Albert? We did everything we were supposed to. It hasn’t worked. It hasn’t worked.\nACE: We have to keep trying.\nHEX: Don’t you see? You were wrong. There’s no way out. We’re going —\nDOCTOR: Well done. It seems you have learned how to act like human beings.\nHEX: Ace! It’s the Doctor! He’s here!\nACE: No, it’s a hologram, a recording.\nDOCTOR: But before I summon the TARDIS, I have some bad news for you. You see, I’m afraid that it will be impossible for either of you to be released — unless one of you remains here. This prison requires the presence of a prisoner to sustain it.\nHEX: (QUIET) We know, that’s how we ended up stuck here.\nDOCTOR: So all you have to do is decide which of you can have your freedom, and which of you will be consigned to this reality for the rest of eternity. You have... one minute to decide.\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 150\nHEX: One minute? Thanks.\nACE: Well, it’s not difficult, is it?\nHEX: No?\nACE: I’m going to stay. You can go.\nHEX: Er, no, I think not. Look, you’re better at this saving-planets lark than me, you’1ll do more good, and you were with the Doctor long before I came along. I’1l1 stay.\nACE: No. You don’t get to decide, you’re a nurse, your job is saving lives. Me, I just blow things up. I’m staying. And that’s final.\nHEX: No. No-one gets to lay their life down for me. Not even you, Ace.\nACE: Don’t be stupid, do you want to be stuck here forever? I’m trying to do the right thing here.\nHEX: And so am I. Besides, if I was the one set free, I’d never forgive myself. I think I’d be okay here on my own knowing it was for a good cause.\nACE: A good cause? You patronising little — (git)\nDOCTOR: Time’s up! I hope you’ve sorted out what you want to do. I’1l be asking each of you individually what you’ve decided.\nHEX: Hey, where did Ace go? What have you done with Ace?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: You must tell me your decision. Which is it to be? Will you be the one who stays, or the one who leaves?\nHEX: I’m staying.\nDOCTOR: As you wish.\nACE: Hey, what did you do? Where’s Hex?\nDOCTOR: (REPLAY OF PREVIOUS DIALOGUE)\nDOCTOR: You must tell me your decision. Which is it to be? Will you be the one who stays, or the one who leaves?\nACE: What do you think? I’m staying.\nDOCTOR: (REPLAY OF PREVIOUS DIALOGUE ) As you wish.\nHEX: Woah, Ace, you’re back!\nACE: Er, if either of us has been doing a disappearing act, it’s you.\nHEX: So you told the Doctor what you wanted to do?\nACE: I did. And you?\nHEX: Yep. (BEAT) I told him I wanted to stay.\nACE: You muppet! I told him I wanted to stay.\nHEX: What? But what happens if we both say we want — (to stay)\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: Congratulations. You’ve passed my final test.\nACE: Your final test?\nDOCTOR: I had to be sure you had learned your lesson. And so I set you a little prisoner’s dilemma. Because only a true human would be prepared to sacrifice their life in order to save another.\nHEX: Oh, I get it. Very clever.\nDOCTOR: And so I gave you a choice. “Protect or survive”. And both of you chose to protect... and so you both get to survive.\nACE: Protect and survive.\nDOCTOR: And now, with any luck, my TARDIS should be on its way...\nACE: Shush. Listen.\nHEX: The TARDIS. It worked! Ace, it worked!\nACE: Hang about, it’s black. Something has turned it black.\nHEX: Who cares what colour it is, it’s here isn’t it?\nACE: Doctor? Doctor, are you in there?\nDOCTOR WHO: PROTECT AND SURVIVE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 153\nHEX: Okay, we’ve gotta get out of here, before this dimension collapses.\nACE: Er, Hex.\nHEX: First, close the doors, then I think I can remember the right sequence of switches on the console —\nHEX: This switch first...\nACE: Hex.\nHEX: What?\nACE: We’re not alone in here. Look.\nHEX: Oh my — (God)\nHEX: (TO SALLY AND ARISTEDES) I don’t believe it. What are you two doing here?\nACE: Yeah, and more to the point — what have you done with the Doctor?\nACE: END OF PART FOUR"
