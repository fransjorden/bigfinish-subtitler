PRE-TITLE SEQUENCE. A ROOM The EERJE WAIL of a child’s humming top whirling up to speed.\nRECEPTIONIST: THE DOCTOR When a humming-top is at the acme of its gyration it becomes so steady and quiet that it doesn’t seem to move. In this state it is said to sleep. Dormir comme un sabot.\nCHARLEY: \"Sleep like a top.\" (beat) I’m scared.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ We’re all scared. But we all agreed. It’s for the common good. Isn’t it?\nCHARLEY: What will it feel like? Do you know?\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ Will it hurt?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Sleep. It will just feel like going to sleep.\nMARCHING: FOOTSTEPS stop outside the room. A thunderous battering at the door. THE\nDOCTOR: drives the humming top louder and louder. WHUUQOMM! WHUUUOOMM!!\nCHARLEY: They’re here! They’ve come for us!\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR It’s time.\nCHARLEY: The door is smashed in with a tremendous crash.\nOPENING: THEME MUSIC. Hold for a beat, then fade under...\nINFOTAINMENT: 1\nTBA: — Mix to RADIO EQ and fade under...\nTBA: 1.2. INT. THE WHITE CITY. PROLE HUTCH. MORNING\nTBA: A dead space. Very claustrophobic. Two PROLES one MALE, one FEMALE, are listening to the radio. (The FEMALE is CHARLEY. Later in the scene, the CONSCIENCE is C’RIZZ).On the radio, an announcer: the VOICE. Genderless, stern yet loving, the- VOICE is a symbol of State control. The VOICE also echoes loudly from outside the hutch.\nTBA: THE VOICE\nTBA: This is the Voice of the White City. Welcome to your new work day. Today is a High Productivity Day. Loyalty and productivity will be rewarded with extra licensed broadcast hours. Your State loves You. Happiness Through Acceptance.\nBOTH: PROLES Productivity Through Happiness.\nBOTH: The announcement introduces tension into the hutch. The PROLES try to deal with it, each in their own way.\nFEMALE: Extra infotainment time! Wonderful! That episode was really exciting. Those two! They must really love each other. I can’t wait to find out what happens next.\nMALE: It’s just an infotainment. Ill get a breakfast cube. We’ll have to hurry though or we’ll be late. I can’t afford to work overtime this month. Not with all those extra broadcast hours to use up.\nFEMALE: Don’t bother with food, Pll go without. There’s no \"just\" about it. Those two really love each other. They’d do anything for each other. As I would. For the Common Good.\nMALE: (turning the idea over in his mind) The Common Good. (beat) You know sometimes I think-\nFEMALE: You sound like you don’t believe in the Common Good.\nMALE: Is there any reason I should?\nMALE: A moment of shocked silence.\nFEMALE: You said... you used a... no! I can’t!\nMALE: (realization — and panic) It was a slip! An accident! I didn’t mean it. I didn’t chink-\nFEMALE: (anger) You certainly didn’t!\nMALE: You provoked me! Surely no-one will notice such a small-\nFEMALE: I noticed! (beat) This is what happens when you don’t listen to regular infotainments. This is what happens when you lie about your broadcast license. (beat) We’re licensed to watch more than a certain amount of hours for a reason you know. And it isn’t so you can play the fool with our lives!\nFEMALE: Lines over lines.\nMALE: OF course. I know that bur-\nFEMALE: I should never have listened to you. I should never have let it go on for so long.\nMALE: But... I only meant to-\nFEMALE: I was blinded by love of course. But you don’t understand what love is.\nMALE: I do, I-\nFEMALE: Real love. Or real loyalty.\nMALE: -do love you I-\nFEMALE: (cutting through definitively) And now this! (disgust) This use of questions.\nMALE: It was just one question-\nFEMALE: (a programmed mantra) Questions Breed Questions. (beat) You know what happens now.\nFEMALE: Another moment of horrified silence.\nMALE: You'll call the Conscience. (beat) But... it’s been too long. We’ll never make up the hours. The fine will be too high. You can’t!\nFEMALE: I must!\nFEMALE: A bleep.\nFEMALE: I have.\nFEMALE: Outside the hutch, the VOICE begins an echoed pronouncement. It’s on the radio too. THE VOICE\nFEMALE: (continues under) Unauthorized use of interrogative preposition committed at hutch two-zero- four-zero-seven-nine, tier M-seven-zero-four, South Plaza. Conscience has been assigned.\nFEMALE: It'll be better for both of us this way.\nMARCHING: FEET sound outside. A KNOCK at the door.\nMALE: Its’ them. So fast...\nFEMALE: Come in...\nFEMALE: The hutch door opens. The CONSCIENCE and the SUB-CONSCIENCE enter.\nFEMALE: Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: (not so much a policeman as a clerk) Begin session. Hutch two-zero-four-zero-seven-nine, tier M-seven-zero-four, South Plaza. Occupants, Proles, two; one male, one female. Confirm, please.\nFEMALE: Confirm, Conscience. It was my decision to-\nCONSCIENCE: A crime has been committed here.\nFEMALE: Yes, Conscience, it was...\nMALE: (shaky courage) I admit to the crime. I used a... I asked a question. The crime is mine alone.\nCONSCIENCE: Determination of blame is not within your purview. There is no need to compound your crime with additional unlawful behavior\nMALE: But I only meant to say that-\nCONSCIENCE: (to SUB-CONSCIENCE) Sub-Conscience: fetch the Box.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Immediately, Conscience.\nTROOPERS: pile into the hutch. Both PROLES are pushed against separate walls.\nCONSCIENCE: Stand still!\nCONSCIENCE: A moment of quiet in which the Box is wheeled into the hutch. It’s big, clunky, with wheezing pumps and clicking valves. The CONSCIENCE switches it on and we hear a KLUNK followed by a powering-up whine like an old TV.\nCONSCIENCE: Scan them.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE At what strength, Conscience?\nCONSCIENCE: Maximum! Always scan at maximum strength!\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Of course, Conscience. My-\nCONSCIENCE: And fifty demerits for asking a question in front of a Prole. Never let a Prole hear you ask a question!\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE My abject apologies, Conscience. (to troopers) Begin scan!\nCONSCIENCE: A sharp whining noise like an old TV set tuning in, as the Box scans the PROLES. It’s a painful process. The PROLES whimper and moan. As the tuning signal homes in it resolves into a dreamlike mumbling... the thoughts of the PROLES.\nBOTH: PROLES (dreamlike thoughts) Obedience... respect... love... honesty... happiness through acceptance... etc...\nCONSCIENCE: (over the above) Yes... yes... see... Hm...\nMALE: (a sudden isolated thought) 1m scared.\nCONSCIENCE: Very well, stop the scan.\nCONSCIENCE: The whining noise stops.\nCONSCIENCE: (curiosity and some surprise) Deep-level Id scan suggests worldview of male includes a signifier for self. (to Male) You have a name.\nMALE: No! I... There’s been a-\nCONSCIENCE: (dismissive) A Prole with a name. Very curious. (to SUB-CONSCIENCE) Transfer this male to the Ministry of Tourism. The Editor will decide what to do with it.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Immediately, Conscience. I also request instructions for the disposal of the female.\nCONSCIENCE: (distracted) The female is clear. Release it.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Conscience...\nCONSCIENCE: Yes, of course, you’re quite right. There is concern regarding psychological cushioning. (to FEMALE) Please confirm emotional dependence on this male.\nMALE: Depends? Of course she does! We depend on each other. We love each-\nCONSCIENCE: Minor personality Revision is permitted to facilitate new State sanctioned marriage. Schedule this female for Reorientation at the first available opportunity.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Confirm, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: Session ends.\nCONSCIENCE: The TROOPERS pack up the scanner and the MALE PROLE, and move out.\nMALE: (to FEMALE) But I love you.\nFEMALE: Very soon we’ll never have met. (beat) We'll be happy again.\nMALE: Why!?\nMALE: The TROOPERS leave. The door shuts with a quiet click, cutting off the MALE’s screamed crime.\nMALE: 1.3. EXT. PLAZA WALKWAY. MORNING High up. Some wind but not cold. Footsteps on concrete as the MALE PROLE is marched along.\nCONSCIENCE: Male Prole will match pace with the squad. Hesitation will be punished.\nMALE: Why are you doing this? Why is it a crime to ask questions? Why is it a crime to love?\nCONSCIENCE: It is not a crime to love.\nMALE: (building to a shout) No of course it isn’t... not when the object of our love is the all powerful White City!\nMALE: The MALE’s shout echoes from nearby buildings.\nMALE: That’s right. All you drudgers down there! Don’t you listen to me. I’ve committed the ultimate sin! I’ve asked a question! Oh no. Don’t listen to me. Just keep to your schedules. Watch your broadcasts. Think your permitted thoughts. Robots! You’re all robots!\nMALE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Male subject has used unauthorized language. Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: (suddenly concerned) So (hear. Gag this Male immediately.\nCONSCIENCE: A short scuffle — the MALE breaks loose momentarily.\nMALE: You can’t even understand me can you? No wonder when half the words I’m speaking have been removed from your language! You don’t even have names! They don’t even let you have names!\nTROOPERS: run closer. Sensing the end is near, the MALE shouts even louder, trying desperately to get the attention of the PROLES below.\nMALE: Listen to me. Listen to my words. Words have been denied us for too long. Without words there can be no thought. Without thought there can be no understanding. How can you love without understanding?\nTROOPERS: make a grab for the MALE, who climbs onto the edge of the walk way.\nCONSCIENCE: Male prole will step back from the parapet immediately!\nCONSCIENCE: A scuffle.\nMALE: I do this in the name of love!\nMALE: The MALE jumps. The last sentence becomes a long scream cut off by a thud as he hits the Plaza beneath. There are many PROLES nearby. No-one takes any notice.\nMALE: (dying breath) won’t anyone even... ask... why?\nMALE: Mix scene to RADIO EQ and Jade under...\nMALE: 1.4. INT. MINISTRY OF TOURISM. THE WHISPERING GALLERY. MID-MORNING\nMALE: A large chamber. Quiet echoes, as if from distant walls. Listening to a recording of the previous scene are the CONSCIENCE and the EDITOR (The EDITOR is THE DOCTOR.)\nEDITOR: I take it this account is complete and uncensored.\nCONSCIENCE: That’s correct, Editor.\nEDITOR: And the witnesses...\nCONSCIENCE: There were slightly more than thousand.\nEDITOR: (mulling it over) Slightly more than a thousand... they saw and heard everything. (it’s not a question)\nCONSCIENCE: Variations to their daily routines are within statutory limits, Editor, but yes, they could hardly have failed to notice such an unusual event.\nEDITOR: And memory is such an... unpredictable process. Neurons. Proteins. The chemical dance that governs our lives. Who can really say whether the things we think of as real, as meaningful, even exist except in our own minds... Tell me have you ever wondered-\nCONSCIENCE: Absolutely not, Editor.\nEDITOR: I’m very pleased to hear it, Conscience. Wondering is the province of those luckier than you or I.\nCONSCIENCE: The task of a Conscience is not to wonder or question. His task is to provide guidance, offer happiness and ensure obedience.\nEDITOR: Happiness through Acceptance.\nCONSCIENCE: Productivity through Happiness. That is what I believe.\nEDITOR: I’m sure it’s what our slightly-more-than-a-thousand witnesses also believe. (beat) List their bar- codes in order of proximity to the crime scene. Tube the information to the Secretary for Revision here at the Ministry of Tourism.\nCONSCIENCE: Ill have the list ready by the end of this current work period.\nEDITOR: It’s clear to me these Proles have been extremely productive. The State rewards productivity. It’s time they had a nice holiday. Oh and Conscience — make sure to include yourself on chat list.\nCONSCIENCE: (tiny hesitation) Naturally, Editor.\nEDITOR: We must lead by example. With absolute power comes absolute responsibility.\nCONSCIENCE: Of course.\nCONSCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE walks away — the chamber is very big. The EDITOR clicks a switch on the broadcast monitor and the MALE PROLE’s last words repeat, rocking back and forth as the\nEDITOR: tries to fathom their meaning.\nMALE: PROLE (radio EQ) Won’t anyone even... ask... why? ...ask... ... eh (= I arn anyone even... ask... why? ...why? ...why?\nMALE: The EDITOR is getting nothing. He switches off the broadcast monitor. KLUNK\nINFOTAINMENT: 2\nTBA: — echoing from giant drive in-style screens around the Plaza. Mix to RADIO EQ and fade under...\nTBA: 1.5. EXT.PLAZA. NOON\nTBA: The sound of PROLES moving and speaking in subdued tones. Some are eating lunch as they watch the Infotainment. A gentle wind moves the trees. No traffic noise. Vehicles are forbidden here. As is unauthorised travel. The CONSCIENCE and SUB-CONSCIENCE cross the Plaza.\nTBA: SUB-CONSCIENCE Id like to thank you, Conscience, for this opportunity to-\nCONSCIENCE: You asked a question. You broke the law. I could have assigned you for personality Revision. Don’t thank me. Watch. Learn. Become a better Citizen.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Happiness through Acceptance. I understand.\nCONSCIENCE: You don’t. But you will. (beat) One way or another.\nPROLES: fall silent as they approach.\nPROLES: SUB-CONSCIENCE They stop talking when you approach. A sign of respect.\nCONCIENCE: Of fear. They’re frightened of me. Of what lean do to them. And they remember what happened here today. It’s why we have to help them.\nCONCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE and SUB-CONSCIENCE pass by, and the subdued conversation from the\nPROLES: resumes exactly as before.\nPROLES: SUB-CONSCIENCE You pass from their lives and their notice. As if you were never here. As if they wish you were never here.\nCONCIENCE: (irony) As if they were permitted to wish.\nCONCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE and the SUB-CONSCIENCE walk up some stone steps.\nCONCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Broadcast House. The seat of power. Ever since I was a child I... I never thought I’d see inside.\nCONSCIENCE: Remain here.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE I— yes, of course, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: Alone, the CONSCIENCE ascends the rest of the stone steps and pushes in through a revolving door.\nCONSCIENCE: 1.6. INT. BROADCAST HOUSE. FOYER. NOON\nCONSCIENCE: A warm acoustic Carpets. Quiet, approved muzak, or PR INFOTAINMENT. The CONSCIENCE crosses the foyer to a reception desk. The RECEPTIONIST is brimming with State-sanctioned happiness.\nRECEPTIONIST: Conscience! Welcome to Broadcast House.\nCONSCIENCE: I need to access the Infotainment schedule. I don’t have an appointment, I’m afraid.\nRECEPTIONIST: For anyone else that would be a problem. Just follow the grey carpet riles to Studio One. You know the way.\nCONSCIENCE: I do. Thank you. I'll need the Disc Jockey.\nRECEPTIONIST: No problem. I'll have him meet you there.\nCONCIENCE: You’ve been very helpful. Happiness through Acceptance.\nRECEPTIONIST: Productivity through Happiness!\nRECEPTIONIST: 1.7. INT. MINISTRY OF TOURISM. WHISPERING GALLERY. AFTERNOON\nRECEPTIONIST: A medical set-up. ASUB-EDITOR and two NURSES have been working on the MALE PROLE?’s body, preparing it for brain surgery. We hear quiet instructions, surgical instruments clicking, the subdued whirr of a saw parting flesh and bone, the hiss of suction removing blood. The EDITOR enters through the distant Gallery door and walks to near-field.\nEDITOR: Report please.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR\nEDITOR: Male subject has been prepared. The body suffered irreparable damage and has been reclaimed by the Department of Protein. The skull however was intact. The cerebellum has been removed. Nutrient lines have been attached to the carotid arteries. I must warn you, sir, that physical and psychological trauma to this brain was extreme. Chances are we’ll recover only ambiguous, deep-level symbols. They can be difficult to interpret.\nEDITOR: I understand. Fetch the Box please, Nurse.\nNURSE: 1 Right away.\nNURSE: I walks to the Box and prepares it for operation.\nEDITOR: A note for future reference, Sub-Editor. Please remember that we only need the brain. We are investigating the mind, the Id, the thought processes. The body is irrelevant. And that includes the face. (beat) It’s hard to remain objective when the subject of your investigation is staring at you from such attractive brown eyes.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR I understand. Nurse, please cover the face.\nEDITOR: NURSE2 Of course.\nNURSE: 2 drapes the face with a plastic cloth as NURSE I wheels the Box closer.\nEDITOR: That’s better. Now we can really get to the heart of the matter.\nEDITOR: The Box is switched on and tuned in to the fragmented images held within the MALE PROLE’s slowly dying brain.\nMONTAGE: Fade up the ghostly rhythmic humming sound of a child’s spinning top. Mix in urgent breathing and moans, the sound of a woman giving birth. Add the sound of building: laying bricks, sawing, cranes moving great loads... The montage builds under...\nEDITOR: Consciousness can be independent of brain function. Think of a radio. If you open it up you will not find the program. The radio is just the receiver. When you turn off the radio the program is still there — you just can’t hear it.\nMALE: (dreamlike thoughts) ... don’t let it fall... don’t let it fall... (suddenly clear) Don’t let me fall!\nMALE: And just like that the sound montage ends... all we can hear is the pure sine-wave resonance oft- he Box tuning signal, slowly fading under...\nEDITOR: The persistence of memory. A single image fighting through the chaos of misfiring neurons. Overwhelming. Ambiguous. The fragment could refer to a child’s toy, a fear of falling... the love of a spouse or lapsed faith in the State. Any memory is meaningless without context. There is no context here. (disappointment) We’ re too late.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR switches off the Box. A moment of silence. The EDITOR switches the Box back on again.\nEDITOR: Access query: Box File alpha-seven-zero-nine-two-nine-five-three; this work period. Conscience probe, deep level. Hutch two-zero-four-zero-seven-nine, tier M-seven-zero-four, South Plaza. Subject: domestic engineer, female. Authorization for access: State Editor.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Access denied. File unavailable.\nEDITOR: Confirm access authority.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Authority confirmed, Editor. Access is denied. File unavailable.\nEDITOR: (considerable surprise) Even to- (ie: \"me?\") (recovering fast) State authority for denial.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Authorization: Certification Board. File status is inactive, pending censorship. Public record will be available in local theaters in due course.\nEDITOR: I see. (to SUB-EDITOR) Tube a warrant to the South Plaza Conscience: I want the female prole from hutch two-zero-four-zero-seven-nine, tier M-seven-zero- four, South Plaza, brought in for cross-referencing.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR Yes, sir.\nEDITOR: And have this male’s remains recycled. A place for ever y thing and everything in its place, Sub- Editor. Blood in this quantity is both wasteful and unconducive to safety in the workplace.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR switches off the Box. KLUNK\nEDITOR: 1.8. INT. BROADCAST HOUSE. STUDIO ONE. MID AFTERNOON\nEDITOR: A large, warm acoustic No echoes - row after row of shelving sees to that. In the shelves — records. Millions of them. The CONSCIENCE is with the DISCJOCKEY — an old man with a sense of humour he learned early in life to keep a tight lid on. The DJ treats the CONSCIENCE as an equal — a trick just this side of disrespect. The CONSCIENCE doesn’t quite know how to deal with this attitude, so ignores it. The DJ is pulling records from shelves, loading the discs into the jukebox, stacking the sleeves for later use.\nEDITOR: DJ\nEDITOR: Be with you in half a mo’ Just setting up the Jukebox here with the Pose Meridian Infotainment Broadcast Schedule. Now then... I’d just love to know where... ah! There you are. These Clerks. I don’t know where they dig them up. They wouldn’t know how to file a nail if they weren’t trained for a year and a day.\nCONSCIENCE: I appreciate your meeting me here on such short notice. The DJ closes the lid on the Jukebox and begins to punch heavy buttons.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ What’s good for the Conscience is good for the State. What’s good for the State is good for me.\nCONSCIENCE: Succinctly put.\nCONSCIENCE: The DJ begins to re-file the empty record sleeves. His words are punctuated by the soft TRUNK of sleeves slotting back into their proper shelf space. Some of them are high up and hard to reach.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ\nCONSCIENCE: There are districts where a Clerk’s job would be to install idiosyncratic filing systems chat wouldn’t make sense to an entire department of war-time code-breakers. The result of which, as I’m sure you’ll realize, is low efficiency, low happiness, and low productivity. Things are different here. The White City. The Capital. Here you will find Axons filed under A and Zarbi filed under Z.\nCONSCIENCE: (bored now) How interesting.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ Oh yes. There are eight basic Hero-types; cross-referencing for Companions and Villains is straightforward, and locating the discs is as easy as- oh!\nCONSCIENCE: The DJ over-reaches and loses his balance. The CONSCIENCE steadies him. DJ\nCONSCIENCE: -er yes, thank you — as easy as falling off a log. With my system, anyone could operate this place.\nCONSCIENCE: Which of course makes you completely indispensable.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ Bad filing is how wars stare, my friend.\nCONSCIENCE: You have a unique perspective.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ An efficient perspective should never be unique.\nCONSCIENCE: The DJ punches buttons on the jukebox, which whirrs into life. The arm clanks into motion, selects a record from a slot, drops the disc onto the turntable. The needle hits with a soft crackle. Faintly we can hear the INFOTAINMENT THEME. This fades under...\nCONSCIENCE: DJ Now. Please tell me how I can help you today.\nCONSCIENCE: I need a list of infotainment broadcasts for the last year. I need to compile a set of word and symbol triggers to cross-reference with a brain scan taken recently from a male Prole. (casual) I'll need Certificated and uncensored files.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ\nCONSCIENCE: An unusual request. (beat — no response from the CONSCIENCE) There are lost episodes of course. Stories that were commissioned but never made. Or made but misfiled post-broadcast. Sheer incompetence, of course, as I said. But with several million records here it’s unlikely we'll ever see the Masters-\nCONSCIENCE: Master?\nCONSCIENCE: DJ\nCONSCIENCE: -of Luxor, for example. Though I believe you can read the script, if you have enough clout in high places. (beat — no response from the CONSCIENCE) But of course you’ re interested in real programs, not the half forgotten memories of an old drudger like me, even when I don’t see the world through rose tinted spectacles. (bored of poking now) V1] get the index. But I can tell you right now it’ll be a big list. Here at Broadcast House we operate two simultaneous schedules. First of all you have your Repeats, which we use to reinforce basic rules for day to day living, behavior in the workplace and at home, that sort of thing. Then you have New Programming. These are specially commissioned works designed to-\nCONSCIENCE: -introduce major changes to the social and psychological structure of the general populace. I know the theory. Now show me the facts.\nCONSCIENCE: DJ Well, since you ask, here it is. The full list. Two hundred and fifty four tides broken down into a total of... let’s see... one thousand, three hundred and... six episodes. With one episode synopsis\nCONSCIENCE: per page plus cast lists, extras, details of props and sets, that makes... (a heckuva lot of pages) ... well. I hope you’ve brought someone to help you carry it all.\nINFOTAINMENT: MONTAGE\nTBA: — hold for a moment, then re-tune to a different channel — it’s another INFOTAINMENT Another channel — another INFOTAINMENT.Then another, and another; channel after channel; the same, all round the dial. With a final impatient KLUNK the last broadcast is replaced by...\nTBA: 1.9. INT. EDITOR’S OFFICE. LATE AFTERNOON\nTBA: An intimate acoustic Soft choral music. No instruments: the EDITOR is a people-person. The\nEDITOR: is tapping a pencil on his desk. He’s puzzled, mulling over the sounds and memories the Box filtered from the chaos in the MALE PROLE’s dying brain.\nEDITOR: The sound of a child’s humming top...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR winds the pencil in circles, squeaking and scraping on the desk top.\nEDITOR: A female in labour...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR takes a second pencil and taps out an increasingly frenetic double-heartbeat.\nEDITOR: The sound of construction...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR takes a third pencil and scrapes it mechanically across the desk: scraaaaaap-tap, scraaaaaaape-tap. All three pencils lock rhythms The force increases. A pencil snaps. CRACK! The choral music reaches a natural crescendo and continues under...\nEDITOR: (a terrible fear) Someone, somewhere, has had... an... idea.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Attention. Attention. Use of uncensored experimental music has been detected...\nEDITOR: (an impatient sigh) Not again.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Location: Ministry of Tourism. Office of The Editor. Post Meridian work period...\nEDITOR: (old news) Music is censored to maintain an emotional equilibrium among the Proles. I’m not a Prole.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE (it’s not a conversation) Use of uncensored music is forbidden by order of the State...\nEDITOR: And I am thinking. To think I need to feel. To feel I must have stimulation.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Conscience has been assigned.\nEDITOR: Do you want me to preserve this perfect lit the State of yours?\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Attention. Unauthorized used of interrogative preposition has been detected...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR sighs in annoyance and turns the music up to cover the VOICEs announcement.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Location: Ministry of Tourism. Office of the Editor. Post Meridian work period. Subject will remain in this location. Conscience has been assigned.\nEDITOR: A knock at the door.\nEDITOR: I’m working!\nEDITOR: The door opens. The CONSCIENCE enter the office.\nCONSCIENCE: So am J, sir.\nEDITOR: I have a right to privacy.\nCONSCIENCE: Of course you do sir. Authorized privacy is essential to happiness.\nCONSCIENCE: THE EDITOR Happiness through Acceptance.\nCONSCIENCE: I’m glad you see it that way sir.\nEDITOR: Alright. Let’s get it over with. Scan me.\nCONSCIENCE: (slightly embarrassed) Thank you sir, but that won’t be necessary. (louder) I’m sure these minor transgressions were committed while protecting the State from a far greater crime. (beat) Please confirm, sir.\nEDITOR: (sudden anger) Confirm. Confirm. I'll tell you what Pll confirm. In this Office, Conscience, we adhere strictly to the Law of Censorship! I wasn’t giving you permission. Now bring in the Box and scan me!\nCONSCIENCE: (thoroughly abashed) At once, Editor. (te TROOPERS) Fetch the Box. The Box is wheeled in and switched on.\nCONCIENCE: Subject will remain still while undergoing scan. (beat) Subject will indicate compliance!\nEDITOR: Yes, of course I’ ll remain still.\nEDITOR: The Box is tuned into the EDITOR’s thoughts.\nCONSCIENCE: I see... yes... I understand. I — (sudden realisation) Oh. (to TROOPERS) Remove the Box. Leave us!\nCONSCIENCE: The Box is switched off and wheeled from the Office.\nCONCIENCE: A test. You were testing me. To see if I had been affected by the Male Prole.\nEDITOR: Not to see if you had been affected- that was inevitable — to assess by what degree you had been affected. Tell me what else you saw. In my mind.\nCONCIENCE: (barely avoiding a question) I... passed the test.\nEDITOR: By the skin of your teeth.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR switches off the music.\nEDITOR: Let me tell you something, Conscience. Our rank does not grant us privileges beyond the median. If anything we owe more loyalty and more responsibility to the State than anyone else except the Board of Censors and the Mayor. It is our duty to implement the Law. But we ourselves must never break it. Never. If we do then then anything we accomplish — all of our good work — will be rendered meaningless. (beat) I’m sure I don’t need to test your understanding.\nCONSCIENCE: No, Editor.\nEDITOR: Good.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE Attention. Female Prole has been processed and is now awaiting cross-referencing in the\nEDITOR: Whispering Gallery.\nCONSCIENCE: If you'll excuse me, I'll leave you to your work.\nEDITOR: No. You can purchase overtime to finish your work later. An opportunity to study this cross- referencing will be good for you. With any luck it will reinforce correct and attainable life-goals.\nCONSCIENCE: I understand.\nCONSCIENCE: The EDITOR ejects the music cassette and gives it to the CONSCIENCE.\nCONSCIENCE: A gift.\nEDITOR: Glasst’s Universe.\nCONSCIENCE: What I heard was very...\nEDITOR: (probing) Yes it was. And perhaps it should be available to all. (no response from the CONSCIENCE) This music is censored because harmonic content apparent in the aria causes cellular damage to certain forms of biological life. The Composer was the final victim. Rules are never made without good reason, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: I understand.\nEDITOR: Think of it as a reminder of the things we sacrifice for the common good. Keep it close. Consider it before each work period. And remember this conversation.\nCONSCIENCE: I will.\nEDITOR: Good. Now remove yourself from the list for Personality Revision, and come with me.\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE follows the EDITOR from his office.\nEDITOR: 1.10. INT. WIDSPERING GALLERY. NO TIME\nEDITOR: A vast space — but the characters are close. An intimate scene — but very cold. No music. The\nFEMALE: PROLE is under examination by the SUB-EDITOR and two NURSES when the EDITOR and the CONSCIENCE enter the Gallery. The Box is active... tuned into the FEMALE’s thoughts.\nMONTAGE: A jumbled copy of that from the dying Male Prole: sounds of building, overlaid with sounds of childbirth, running backwards to stop abruptly at the sound of bricks being laid, and then the ghostly rhythm of a child’s humming top spinning endlessly...\nFEMALE: (dreamlike thoughts) my child... don’t let him... don’t... (sudden clarity) Don’t let me fall!\nFEMALE: SUB-EDITOR The same sounds.\nEDITOR: The same words.\nCONSCIENCE: Coincidence.\nEDITOR: Unlikely.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR The memory symbols are assembled in a different order to that of the Male Subject.\nEDITOR: But they have a nexus.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR The words: \"Don’t let me fall.\"\nEDITOR: And the sound of a child’s toy. A humming top...\nCONSCIENCE: (no-one else will say it) A trigger.\nEDITOR: Good. A hypnotic, I agree. And the sounds of building...\nCONSCIENCE: Symbolic, of course. A barrier. Something to protect the deeper levels.\nEDITOR: The deeper levels. Like Russian Dolls, nested at the cerebellum. The mammal brain, the reptile brain, the snake brain... each a more primitive: state than the one before... deeper and deeper... further and further back in time... until... until... (abruptly) No. Not a barrier. At least, not completely. And not going backwards. Think of the other sounds. Childbirth. That’s a sound associated with the future. Add this to the sounds of construction. Yes. Yes, I see it clearly now. This female wants to give birth — to the future! Sees herself as mother and architect — of the future!\nNURSE: 1 (terrified) Change. This female wants to make-\nNURSE: 2 gives a horrified gasp at NURSE I1’s use of a censored word.\nEDITOR: Control your staff, Sub-Editor!\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR My apologies, Editor. Nurse. Report for immediate Revision.\nNURSE: 1 Yes, sir, right away. You’re right. I should never have... I’m sorry!\nNURSE: 1 leaves the Gallery.\nEDITOR: Incredible. If I had not actually witnessed this I would have believed it a lie. A Prole — capable of original thought! Conceiving a world-view beyond its own! Projecting to a future that has yet to take place — and... (horror of horrors!) ... presuming it could shape that future! (rising anger) A Prole is incapable of acting alone. There must be a network. An underground. Social crime like Russian Dolls spiraling further and further out into the world, the lives we have built so carefully, shaped so meticulously... They must... they must be...! (desperately wants to say killed’: Regains control by a supreme effort) Well. {shuddering breath) There we have it, in block capitals even a child could read. (beat) Revolution. (beat) Nurse. Wake the Subject.\nNURSE: 2 At once sir.\nNURSE: 2 punches buttons. The electronically induced anaesthesia is reduced and the FEMALE\nPROLE: begins to regain consciousness.\nFEMALE: Fall... don’t... let me... love the... Stare. I love the State. I venerate the Regime.\nEDITOR: (hate — he’s lost his objectivity) You may think the worst thing I can do to you is hurt you.\nFEMALE: I love the State. I love the State. I venerate the Regime.\nEDITOR: Prayers won’t help you now.\nFEMALE: I love the State! I venerate the Regime! Why are you doing this to me?!\nFEMALE: The EDITOR picks up a pencil and pad; methodical note-taking.\nEDITOR: (making notes) Session one. Post Meridian. The Subject — a female Prole — has asked her first question. Self orientation query typical of standard ego in pre-Revision ‘realization’ phase.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR makes a few more notes and then puts down the pencil and pad. Each underlined word in the next speech is matched by a scream from the FEMALE. We can only imagine what terrible things the EDITOR is doing to her with his bare hands — or maybe it’s just the ideas that are so painful.\nEDITOR: (to FEMALE) Questions are bad for the common good. (a mantra - relentless logic) Questions lead to answers. Answers lead to knowledge. Knowledge leads to freedom. Freedom leads to dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction leads to... (we expect a scream but get just a whimper) (quiet — almost gentle) ... unhappiness. (kind) The State wants you to be happy. The State wants all of its citizens to be happy.\nFEMALE: I love the... the... State. I... ven... venerate... the-\nEDITOR: If you did, you would not ask.\nEDITOR: Another scream from the FEMALE -— the worst yet. The scream subsides eventually into sobs and desperate gulps of air.\nEDITOR: You may think the worst thing I can do to you is hurt you. (to NURSE 2) Fetch The Index.\nNURSE: 2 Yes, Editor.\nNURSE: 2 walks away.\nFEMALE: I love the... I... uuhh... (the words won’t come)\nNURSE: 2 returns with the Index.\nEDITOR: Thank you Nurse.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR puts down his pencil and pad, opens The Index and riffles through the cards. The\nFEMALE: begins to whimper. This continues under...\nEDITOR: (extracting, examining and replacing Index cards) There are truths that make our great Metropolis work. A Builder builds. A Healer heals. An Editor performs Revisions. For each his proper place. (it’s a slogan) Happiness Through Acceptance. (riffling cards — a simple sound but in context, terrifying) A citizen supports. A citizen serves. A citizen does not use questions. A citizen does not enjoy freedom. Only the deviant use questions. Only the perverse crave freedom. You have used questions. You have enjoyed freedom. (takes a last card from The Index and taps it thoughtfully with a fingernail) Therefore you can no longer... be.\nEDITOR: The FEMALE moans. Sheer terror. She knows what’s coming This continues under...\nEDITOR: (a moment of sympathy) There, there. It’s alright. It’s alright. It’s for your your own good. The State loves you. It loves you. Take a breath. That’s right. A deep breath. There. (harder) Now say goodbye to everything you ever knew.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR slams the lid of the Index shut. BOOM! The noise is for too loud: a real Hitchcock moment. The FEMALE screams.\nCLOSING: THEME MUSIC — END OF PART ONE\nCLOSING: Establish, hold for a few bars, then re-tune to...\nCLOSING: PART TWO\nCLOSING: Author’s Note: In Part 2 the character of THE NURSE is played by INDIA FISHER. (THE NURSE is the Revised FEMALE PROLE. from Part 1.)\nOPENING: THEME MUSIC —- PART TWO\nINFOTAINMENT: 3\nTBA: — MIX to RADIO EQ and fade under...\nTBA: 2.1. INT.WHITE CITY. CITIZEN’S HOME.MORNING\nTBA: Not such a cramped acoustic as a PROLE HUTCH. A Citizen’s home has more rooms and — luxury of luxuries — a Broadcast Monitor in each. Two CITIZENS are listening to the INFOTAINMENT, a NURSE and an ENGINEER (The NURSE is CHARLEY; ie: the Revised\nFEMALE: PROLE. from Part One.) The NURSE is distracted — she has sensed something odd about the broadcast. The ENGINEER is also worried — he has sensed something odd about the NURSE.\nTBA: speaking along with CHARLEY’s dialogue from the INFOTAINMENT. She’s hesitant. Doesn’t quite have all the words... yet.\nENGINEER: You must love these stories.\nNURSE: (reflective) I do... they’re important... I... (changing tack: a fact — not a question) ... they stick in your mind.\nENGINEER: Well, I don’t see how. This is a new Season. Maybe the writers are getting lazy. Reusing the same ideas. (another mantra) Lazy workers make poor product.\nNURSE: (distracted)Yes... you’re probably right... though I don’t think it’s really so much a case of them being lazy as me remembering things I can’t have heard- ( ie: \"before.\")\nENGINEER: (worried) Darling... (sharply) Darling!\nNURSE: Sorry. I was just-\nENGINEER: It’s alright! It’s alright. Now I want you to do something for me. Say you will.\nNURSE: Of course. Anything.\nENGINEER: Make an appointment to see the Conscience. Buy a sick-day. We can afford it.\nNURSE: (the unease begins to fade) You know — you’re right. It has been bothering me. I will go and see the Conscience. (happy) A little post-Holiday therapy will do me the world of good!\nENGINEER: Oh that’s terrific! Darling, I’m so pleased you agree with me. Happiness through Acceptance.\nNURSE: Productivity through Happiness.\nNURSE: They embrace and kiss. A tender moment.\nENGINEER: Oh well. Must dash. Proles! They’d build the new Public Infotainment Screens upside down if I gave ‘em half a chance! See you later!\nNURSE: (distracted) Yes... see you...\nNURSE: The MALE leaves the hutch. The NURSE turns up the INFOTAINMENT volume.\nNURSE: (uneasy and fearful) Yes... 1 remember that... but... no, no, it’s not possible. This isn’t a repeat. Ican’t... I didn’t...\nNURSE: The NURSE senses something wrong with the INFOTAINMENT.\nNURSE: That’s not right... it didn’t happen like that... I didn’t say that...\nNURSE: Something odd is happening here. The NURSE is talking about the INFOTAINMENT as if SHE were the DOCTOR\nNURSE: MIX to RADIO EQ and fade under...\nNURSE: 2.2. INT. OFFICE OF THE CONSCIENCE. NOON The Box is on. The NURSE and the CONSCIENCE are watching a recording of the previous scene.\nNURSE: So you see, under the circumstances, I felt it was important to arrange an appointment as soon as possible.\nCONSCIENCE: Well, I wouldn’t worry too much. A little disorientation is to be expected after a long Holiday. It'll fade with rime.\nNURSE: Well thank goodness for that.\nNURSE: On the monitor the INFOTAINMENT ends at a suitable cliffhanger and the VOICE issues a repeat of the standard \"Welcome To Your New Work Day\" announcement. The CONSCIENCE switches the Box off.\nCONSCIENCE: (small-talk) In the meantime I’1] just take a few notes. Now. You told me you knew lines from the broadcast, even though it wasn’t a repeat.\nNURSE: Yes. That’s right.\nCONSCIENCE: And you’ve never worked in Broadcast House.\nNURSE: No. that’s right, I haven’t.\nCONSCIENCE: I see. You’re a Nurse. Your husband’s an Engineer. Tell me about your marriage.\nNURSE: It’s the best! You can’t be together for as long as we have without being in love, you know.\nCONSCIENCE: Of course not. You have children.\nNURSE: (undercurrent of unease) We’ve applied for permission. The paperwork is extensive.\nCONSCIENCE: It’s not important. Tell me about your Holiday.\nNURSE: It was wonderful.\nCONSCIENCE: Tell me where you went.\nNURSE: Oh... abroad, I think. We had a lovely time.\nCONSCIENCE: Lovely.\nNURSE: Yes. Yes, I remember that very well.\nCONSCIENCE: (down to business) Good. Now. The reason that brought you here. Tell me all you can about it.\nNURSE: Sometimes... sometimes I can remember things. Things that haven’t happened. (beat) My husband noticed it first. I knew before that, of course, that my behaviour was... anyway... once he pointed out what I was doing, it seemed obvious I should report the matter.\nCONSCIENCE: (getting chilly now) Failing to report deviant behaviour is a crime.\nNURSE: Yes... I know that.\nCONSCIENCE: And yet you failed to report your own behaviour.\nNURSE: That’s right.\nCONSCIENCE: I fail to see why.\nNURSE: I don’t... Imean I... Ihave no answer, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: (disappointment?) No. It doesn’t seem as if you do.\nCONSCIENCE: A moment of reflection. And growing tension.\nNURSE: I want you to report this matter. However it turns out. I don’t believe in secrets. I know they’re not allowed. I love the State. I want to be a good Citizen.\nCONSCIENCE: You’ve no need to worry about privacy. This conversation is being recorded and will be passed on to the appropriate authority as a matter of due course.\nNURSE: Secrets breed questions. Questions are bad for the common good.\nCONSCIENCE: (quick-fire test) Questions-\nNURSE: -lead co answers.\nCONSCIENCE: Answers-\nNURSE: -lead co knowledge.\nCONSCIENCE: Knowledge-\nNURSE: -leads to freedom.\nCONSCIENCE: Freedom-\nNURSE: -leads to dissatisfaction.\nCONSCIENCE: Dissatisfaction-\nNURSE: -leads to unhappiness.\nCONSCIENCE: (pushing hard) The State wants you to be happy.\nNURSE: (uncertain) The State wants all of its Citizens to be happy. (convincing herself) The State wants all of its Citizens to be happy. I want to be happy. I am happy.\nCONSCIENCE: I’m very pleased to hear it. Happiness through Acceptance.\nNURSE: (relief) Productivity through Happiness.\nCONSCIENCE: I want to hypnotise you. Just to help you remember.\nNURSE: Is that safe?\nCONSCIENCE: Perfectly.\nCONSCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE puts a spinning top on the table between them.\nNURSE: A spinning top.\nCONSCIENCE: A child’s toy, nothing more.\nCONSCIENCE: He begins to pump the handle. The top spins. A hypnotic humming. WHUUM- WHUUUUUUM! WHUUM-WHUUUUUUM!\nNURSE: (getting dreamy) I like the pictures... the smiling faces... they look familiar... and the blue box... I know... they remind me of the actors who play the Hero and his Companions... in... in the... Info... rain ...mmmm... ment... (fade this under the Conscience so it joins up with the NURSE’s next line)\nCONSCIENCE: Listen to the sound of my voice. Focus on the sound of my voice. No you don’t need to look at me. Close your eyes if you want. Now. Tell me about the Infotainment. Tell me how it differed from your memory.\nNURSE: (hesitant) The Hero... the Doctor... arrived in the White City... in the Plaza... with his Companions... It was... the post-meridian work period... just before the Jubilee... the sun was warm... everyone was happy... the Doctor was... (firmer) ... happy as a hermit crab with a new boot for a home! (puzzled) Hermit crab...\nCONSCIENCE: Never mind. Please continue.\nNURSE: He said... \"Look at this place! It’s magnificent! I can’t imagine anything bad happening here.\" His friends thought it was very bright. (good memories) He said, \"One could ask for a touch more variety, if one were inclined. A splash of Pollock to point up the mid-tones, a hint of Breughel to deepen the shadows.\" He found some Ray Bans in his pocket, gave them to his friends. Everyone was happy. And that was the same. The same as the Infotainment. (some discomfort) But then I remember... they were happy because they travelled a lot together and this was an interesting new place for them... and travel is forbidden. We have everything we need right here in the White City. We’re happy here. Why would someone make an Infotainment about travelling when we’re so happy to live here? (tension) And then his friend, the Male Nurse, asked about a Llama. A Dalai Llama. He thought it was an animal. His other friend, the Female, thought that was strange...so did I for that matter. Questions are forbidden, after all. (fear) Iremember... he told them about... Buddhism. Reincarnation. And that made them happy. It was good that they were happy. But... Conscience, what is \"faith?\" What is Reincarnation? How can I remember things that haven’t happened to me?\nCONSCIENCE: Tell me why you think the Censor would allow characters in an Infotainment to ask questions.\nNURSE: Oh they didn’t. Not in the Infotainment.\nCONSCIENCE: Only in your memory.\nNURSE: Yes, that’s right. Conscience I’m frightened. Is there something wrong with me? Am [a bad Citizen?\nCONSCIENCE: You speak of questions. And ask questions of me. You behave as if it were Jubilee.\nNURSE: Oh, of course! Jubilee. That must be it! The Infotainment must have been about... (a shuddering breath) ... about... (an overwhelming memory) ... asking... they... were all asking... so many... no... can’t... it’s too much! I can’t.... stop it... why can’t you stop it! Make them go... Charley, where are you? C’rizz help me! She’ll drown if we can’t-!!\nCONSCIENCE: You’re beginning to wake up now. When I snap my fingers you’ll awake refreshed and very pleased to have been so helpful. Ready...\nCONSCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE stops pumping the top and snaps his fingers. The humming stops. The\nCONSCIENCE: puts the toy away.\nCONSCIENCE: Drink this. (a glass of water)\nNURSE: (greedy gulps) ...help...I can’t.. what did I... (catches herself in time) ...can’t remember what I said.\nCONSCIENCE: Drink the rest of your water. And don’t worry about what you said. It’s all on record. You can view the certificated transcript later. In the Theatre...\nCONSCIENCE: MIX to RADIO EQ and fade under...\nCONSCIENCE: 2.3. INT. THEATRE. LATE AFTERNOON\nCONSCIENCE: A large chamber; a whispering ambiance from staggered tiers of Broadcast Monitors... a nomad tribe of disaffected PROLES flipping through the properly Certificated moments of their lives... reinforcing their valuable status as Citizens of the State... and not incidentally overriding any memory fragments left over from before their last Holiday. The NURSE has been here for some time watching the previous scenes on a Broadcast Monitor she’s rented. She’s close to tears, clearly upset by what she has seen. And she’s also being watched. By the EDITOR.\nEDITOR: Please. Take this.\nNURSE: Editor! How long have you- I didn’t see you. Watching me. I mean- Thank you. (blows nose) My life... up there on the screen... it must be- I mean, you must think me... very boring.\nEDITOR: Not at all. come here often. I watch the people watching themselves. Validating their lives. They come here frightened, confused, sometimes with thoughts they shouldn’t be thinking. Later they leave; stable, confirmed... happy. I find the experience uplifting. Even joyful.\nNURSE: Urn. Yes. Well. I must admit...\nEDITOR: You’re surprised. It’s only natural. Even the Editor has human needs.\nNURSE: Um... yes, I suppose. Not that I mean... well... you know what I mean.\nEDITOR: Always. (beat) You’ve been watching yourself.\nNURSE: Yes, Editor.\nEDITOR: You don’t seem the type to need reminding of how happy you are.\nNURSE: Er...\nEDITOR: You don’t know how to respond. I understand. Self-referencing topics can be confusing. Objectivity. That’s the key-word. Fortunately it’s still one we’re allowed to use. Objectivity is essential to happiness. Happiness through Acceptance.\nNURSE: (familiar ground) Productivity through Happiness.\nEDITOR: I’m glad you see it that way.\nEDITOR: A moment of awkward silence.\nEDITOR: You want to ask if there’s anything else you can help me with.\nNURSE: Well of course I — (recognising the trap) — no, never! Questions are... I would never pose a question, Editor. If information is required I will give it, as you see fit.\nEDITOR: An excellent response.\nNURSE: Thank you, Editor.\nEDITOR: Your husband was wise to suggest therapy. You came here feeling confused... worried, even scared. Now you’ve met the Editor, found he’s not such an ogre... even engaged him in conversation. You’re a good Citizen. The State values all good Citizens. Perhaps you’d like to have your views transcribed for the National Paper. So your words can help others love the State as you do?\nEDITOR: The NURSE doesn’t know how to respond. The EDITOR has asked a question.\nNURSE: If you see fit, Editor.\nEDITOR: You find the idea uncomfortable?\nNURSE: I... ’'m just a Citizen. One of many. No more or less important than any other.\nNURSE: The EDITOR hasn't missed the NURSE’s ambiguous response to his little crime.\nEDITOR: (warm — another trap?) It’s a pleasure to meet such a model Citizen. May I pay for your Monitor time?\nNURSE: Yes. Yes, thank you. I had to buy a sick-day today and well... money is tight.\nNURSE: The NURSE and the EDITOR begin to walk slowly through the Theatre, past whispering Monitor and hushed PROLES. In some cases the PROLES are sobbing at the confirmation of their lives, but whether in fear or awe we can’t tell.\nEDITOR: You’re wondering why we’re here together, like this. ’m curious about you. The truth is ’ve been watching you for some time. (a whisper) I wanted to assess your Revision personally.\nNURSE: I see.\nEDITOR: (intimate) ’'m sure you don’t. Confidentially... I suspect that prior to your Revision someone gained access to the Ministry.\nNURSE: Oh.\nEDITOR: (mild aggression) You’re not curious? Of course you are. But like a good Citizen you won’t ask. Let me tell you something. Our State is built on an order which dates back hundreds, thousands of generations. Even chaos here in the White City is precisely controlled. For Prole and Citizen, the quarterly hour of Jubilee is a chance to break the rules without fear of punishment. For the State, it’s an opportunity to observe and limit the process of social mutation. But now... now someone has introduced a true random element into the mix. (a forbidden word) The times they are a-changing. (significance) No-one is safe anymore. (beat)\nEDITOR: \"Don’t let me fall.\"\nNURSE: (tension) I don’t really understand what this has to do with me.\nEDITOR: (Setup for a trap? Maybe) In our conversation I used questions. Your responses were not among those recommended by the State. This could mean you’re linked to the chaotic element I have detected.\nNURSE: (automatic anger) That’s outrageous, I-\nEDITOR: No, wait, please! Let me finish. (beat — urgent whisper) Listen. Society is built upon a wheel of change. Prevent change and you prevent advancement. Only stagnation is left. Do you agree? Without change we die. But change itself is dead here. Even the random force of evolution has been controlled.\nEDITOR: The volume of the whispered Monitors is beginning to rise. Now we can hear more than just snatches. Whole words. Forbidden words. \"Dream.\" \"Imagine.\" \"Experiment.\" \"Change.\"\nNURSE: Those words! Evolution. Change. They’re forbidden words. You shouldn’t use them! I could be Revised just for listening co you!\nEDITOR: (a trap?) Please! Hear me out. I’m the Editor. I have a certain freedom. I use it co chink. To listen to music. Uncensored music. There are days when I can fed the chemical dance in my head spinning out of control. I chink. I imagine. I dream. Didn’t you ever dream? Of freedom? Not even once?\nEDITOR: The whispering reaches a crescendo and ceases abruptly. Silence.\nNURSE: (rising to a shout) No. No this is wrong! You’re not allowed to dream! You’re trying to crick me! Leave me alone! Crimes have been committed here! Summon the Conscience! Arrest the Editor!\nNURSE: No-one takes any notice.\nNURSE: Do something! Somebody do something!\nMARCHING: FOOTSTEPS approaching swiftly. The CONSCIENCE.\nNURSE: Conscience! What a relief! Arrest the Editor. He wants to start a revolution. He wants to involve me in a revolution!\nCONSCIENCE: It’s alright. Calm down. No crime has taken place here.\nNURSE: I... Idon’t... wait. It was a test. You were testing me!\nNURSE: The EDITOR doesn’t respond.\nNURSE: That was it! Of course it was. A test. I passed, though, didn’t I? I passed your test. I am a good Citizen.\nEDITOR: (she passed) Thank you for your time. Your monitor bill will be paid. You may leave now. Go back to your husband. He’ll be glad to see you.\nNURSE: (a question) I can...? (a statement) ...Yes. Yes of course. I can go. Thank you.\nNURSE: The NURSE leaves the Theatre. Did anyone notice her little slip?\nEDITOR: You may all leave!\nEDITOR: One by one the PROLES in the Theatre switch off their Monitors and shuffle out. Silence.\nCONSCIENCE: Your staff, of course.\nEDITOR: Of course.\nCONSCIENCE: They’ lI still have to be Revised.\nEDITOR: Naturally.\nCONSCIENCE: You found out what you wanted to know.\nEDITOR: Always.\nCONSCIENCE: You saw her response to your test. She doesn’t have anything to do with the Revolution. She’s just a Nurse. She’s safe.\nCONSCIENCE: A moment — the EDITOR doesn’t respond.\nCONSCIENCE: I recommend we terminate any record beyond routine public surveillance.\nEDITOR: I see. (beat) Very well. You may leave.\nCONSCIENCE: Before I do that I’d like to voice a concern.\nEDITOR: About my methods.\nCONSCIENCE: (somewhat embarrassed — they’re both professionals: he shouldn’t have to be saying this) Many questions were asked, many forbidden words used, in your pursuit of the truth concerning the Nurse’s connection to this... Revolution. (harder now - more confidence) Some might label your behaviour obsessive. Certainly your use of proscribed language was unorthodox. Its’ well within my purview to request an explanation.\nEDITOR: (a threat) Don’t you trust me?\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE doesn’t respond.\nEDITOR: (brisk) You may resume your duties.\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE doesn’t respond.\nEDITOR: (angry) Until such time as the Board Revises this office, I am still your superior!\nCONSCIENCE: (he’s lying) I don’t question it, Editor.\nEDITOR: I’m very pleased to hear that, Conscience.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR walks away, leaving the CONSCIENCE alone in the Arena.\nCONSCIENCE: (to himself) But the Nurse questioned you. And you didn’t notice it. Did you?\nINFOTAINMENT: 4 TBA. Mix to a RADIO EQ and fade under...\nINFOTAINMENT: 2.4. EXT.WHITE CITY. HARBOUR.NIGHT\nINFOTAINMENT: A wide open acoustic The slap of water against wooden pilings. A breeze. Out in the harbour, a buoy with a bell dings solemnly as it bobs from side to side. The sound echoes off the walls of nearby buildings. The CONSCIENCE and the NURSE are walking.\nCONSCIENCE: You’re wondering why I asked you to meet me here, at the harbour. What I wanted to talk about.\nNURSE: Wondering is forbidden. You know that. This is another test. You and the Editor. You’re checking up on me. Making sure I’m happy. Making sure I’m a good Citizen. (beat) You’re frightening me! I am a good Citizen! So is my husband! We’d never do anything antisocial. We love the State!\nCONSCIENCE: I love the State too. I love the potential of the State. A City such as ours, in a world like this. There is no limit for us. (beat) None except char which is imposed upon us.\nNURSE: (sucked in despite herself) But... tell me why... someone would do that.\nCONCIENCE: You think I know. You think I have answers for you. You have answers for me!\nNURSE: (awful foreboding) What... tell me what you mean!\nCONSCIENCE: Tell me how you feel. Since your Holiday. Tell me how you felt listening to that Infotainment, knowing the words, speaking them aloud, even before the characters did themselves. Tell me how you could remember someone else’s memories!\nNURSE: No. I thought all this was over. I just want to go home!\nCONSCIENCE: (growing urgency) Look. Something went wrong, I grant you that. We planned carefully but something happened. I tried my best! But I’m not a DJ! ’'m not an Editor! I don’t have the skill! (scary now) Oh my love, how I’ve missed you, these last years! Watching you and knowing you couldn’t remember me. Love me. But now. Now it’s all been worthwhile.\nNURSE: (lines over lines) What... no. Don’t say those things. You’re frightening me. Don’t say those things!\nCONSCIENCE: (riding roughshod over her protestations) I knew. I knew if I pushed you, if I dug deep enough, I'd find you in there. I promised I’d never leave you, not while I had a mind to remember. But I’ve had to be so careful. And it’s been so long. But you still love me don’t you? Somewhere inside? Say that you do!\nCONSCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE tries to kiss the NURSE, who struggles wildly.\nNURSE: What are you- No! Stop it! She kicks him — hard.\nNURSE: You’re my Conscience, and I obey you. But you can’t do that!\nCONSCIENCE: You think I want to assault you? The only rape here is what they’ve done to your mind. What they’ve done to all our minds! We’re prisoners. We just can’t see the bars!\nCONSCIENCE: A breathless moment — both try to calm down.\nCONSCIENCE: You don’t... you don’t know how to respond... to the situation.\nNURSE: You’re my Conscience. You’re supposed to protect me from this sort of situation.\nCONSCIENCE: You’re right. I’m sorry. Bur listen. Please. It’s very important that you listen to me. Everything depends on it. The Revolution depends on it.\nCONSCIENCE: Shocked silence.\nCONSCIENCE: Look at the boars. These mouldering wrecks lathered with weed. There’s a legend. That generations ago slaves were brought to the White City. By boat. From overseas.\nCONSCIENCE: \"Overseas\" is a forbidden word.\nNURSE: That’s... you used a...\nCONSCIENCE: Forbidden word, yes. (a sigh) The word is not the problem. The word is just a symbol. It is the idea that is proscribed The idea that there could be somewhere other than this, better than this. A land from which our ancestors were taken against their will, and brought here, and caged. In their heads. For the good of the State. (beat) You can’t deny it. It could be true. I could be right. And you, for all your unswerving loyalty... there could be a better way for you than blind worship of a faceless Regime!\nCONSCIENCE: The words echo loudly across the water.\nNURSE: (crumbling) That’s it. I can’t take any more of this. You’re mad. You should be Revised. There is no revolution! How can there be when revolution is forbidden? I’m summoning the Editor! You’ll be arrested! Arrested and Re-\nCONSCIENCE: (widening the cracks) You asked a question.\nNURSE: No! I— It was a slip. No-one will know-\nCONSCIENCE: (blow after blow — relentless logic) You asked many questions. You remember things that haven’t happened to you.\nNURSE: My Holiday. I’m still getting used to-\nCONSCIENCE: (the final hammer blow) Don’t you want to know why?\nNURSE: (surrender) Yes! Yes I want to know! Of course I want to know! How could anyone not want to know! (yearning) Oh, I want to know... to understand... (resignation) Tell me... please... (anger) Just tell me what you’ve done to me!\nCONSCIENCE: Come with me. Here. Under the board-walk. Out of the wind.\nCONSCIENCE: They climb down a wooden Ladder onto the stony beach, and make their way between the wooden pilings. The wind fades, the lapping waves grow louder.\nCONSCIENCE: The State. It’s very old. No-one really knows how old. Hundreds of generations. Maybe thousands. Nothing can exist that long without change. The State knows that. They’re terrified, you know. Of change. Choice. Evolution. Imagination. (beat) Freedom.\nNURSE: But we are free! We make choices every day.\nCONSCIENCE: From a list they supply. The choices aren’t ours. The choices are theirs. Why else do you think they have an Editor? One hint that you see beyond the limits they set and off you go on Holiday. And back you come with a shiny new personality.\nNURSE: This... this can’t be real... I’m dreaming...\nCONSCIENCE: Dreaming is also a cause for concern. Why else have a Conscience?\nNURSE: Alright! Alright, P'Il listen. But-\nCONSCIENCE: You’re scared. That’s understandable. The truth is addictive. But it curs so deep. (talking about the past now) Deeper than flesh. Deeper than muscle or sinew or bone. And it hurts... it hurts so much...\nNURSE: (intuition) You were in love. With her. Whoever I was... before I was... me. (she’s right and they both know it) Tell me then. Tell me all of it.\nCONSCIENCE: The White City. You think it’s so perfect. You think you’re so happy here. But that’s what they want you to think, what they’ve programmed you to think. The Infotainments we lap up so eagerly. They’re not stories. Not adventures. They’re suggestions. Instructions they use to direct the way we think. We are their slaves. (beat) But it’s worse than that. So much worse. The broadcasts. They’re real memories. Stolen. Edited. Re-written by them and used to control us.\nNURSE: You can’t be... that can’t be...\nCONSCIENCE: (bitter) True? It is. The Hero was real. His name was the Doctor. He stood for freedom and fought oppression wherever he found it. But long ago he fell to the shadows. They took him. Re- wrote him. Gave him back to us as a fiction they knew we would idolise. No man now but a drone. A robot. The ultimate selfless drudger. His charisma, his intelligence, his imagination and his heroism corrupted. And us? We follow our Hero blindly, day after day, story after story; along a road that once we would have burned. (disgust) And we think we are happy. (calmer) There is a cell. Within the Revolution. The Restoration Group. You and I were part of this group. Over the years we secretly recorded the broadcasts, comparing the repeats, removing inconsistencies and lies... like a sculptor paring away stone, to reveal... the original intention... the director’s cut, you might say. His message.\nNURSE: I can’t listen to this. I want to go home now. Please let me go.\nCONSCIENCE: No! You must listen. There’s more. The Group had a plan. To create a new Hero for the people. To restore a set of uncensored memories, the Doctor’s original memories, and place these memories into a new mind. A Revised mind. (beat) Your mind. (beat) The Doctor must live again — in you! His memories must live again, his personality, his message. Revolution! Revolution now! And you, Doctor — you won’t let us fall again!\nNURSE: This is mad. What you’re saying is madness. You’ll be arrested. Revised. I’m going home!\nCONSCIENCE: You think you’re scared. You think you’ll be Revised. You’ve already been Revised, more times than you know. Listen. Before your husband, and the husband before him, you were part of the Revolution. You devised a plan. Your memories were erased using a hypnotic trigger to hide that plan from the State. Your life was carefully arranged. You were set up with a husband to whom information was leaked. He died so you could be arrested and Revised. Only the Revision process can install new memories into a living mind. My job was to replace your scheduled Revision personality with our copy of the Doctor’s memories. I’m not an expert. Obviously I got something wrong. But you are the Doctor. That’s why you can remember things you shouldn’t be able to. That’s why you feel the way you do. You are the Doctor now. (Has he pushed her too for? Maybe) Don’t you understand? It was your plan! You conceived it. You were the only one prepared to take the risk. The risk to themselves. Of death. Or insanity. (the NURSE isn’t getting it) The people need a Hero. A real Hero. Not to overthrow a dictatorship. Not to kill and burn. To give us a future! One we can choose for ourselves. (he’s lost her and he knows it) You knew that. You still know it. [know you do. Somewhere inside. Buried deep. Out of reach. Trust me. I can help you reach it. Open your eyes. Open your eyes and really see!\nCONSCIENCE: A long moment of silence. Will the NURSE see things his way?\nNURSE: (shouting ) Thought Crime! Word Crime! Thought Crime has happened here! Summon the Editor! Arrest the Conscience! Thought Crime has happened here!\nNURSE: The NURSE’s voice echoes stridently across the harbour.\nCONSCIENCE: (broken) No! You can’t. After everything I said, everything we meant to each other, you can’t! I love you!\nNURSE: Get away from me! You’re deviant! You’re sick! Revision is too good for you. There is no punishment suitable for your crimes! (shouting again) Summon the Editor! Arrest the Conscience! Thought Crime has been committed here! (breaking down to shocked sobs) Thought Crime has... has been...\nNURSE: The VOICE takes up the NURSE’s chant, echoing stridently across the harbour. The sound of\nTROOPERS: running across the board-walk drowns the NURSE’s sobs. We hear truncheons foiling, blow after blow...\nCONSCIENCE: Remember... please remember! For everyone’s sake... You have... to... re-\nCONSCIENCE: The CONSCIENCE is driven to the ground... the truncheons keep rising and falling, cutting off his pleading words... A final SMACK! And we cut to...\nCONSCIENCE: 2.5. INT.MINISTRY OF TOURISM. HALLWAY. NIGHT A distant SCREAM; long, despairing, agonised; prowling restlessly through the deserted halls of the Ministry.\nCONSCIENCE: 2.6. INT.MINISTRY OF TOURISM WIDSPERING GALLERY. NIGHT\nCONSCIENCE: Close on the scream. It’s the CONSCIENCE. The scream tails off into bubbling hysteria, fading under the muted chatter of the SUB-CONSCIOUS and NURSES and the piercing whine of the Box.\nNURSE: 3\nNURSE: ... pressure seventeen over fifty three and falling.. nineteen over sixty and falling... 23... 27... still falling...\nNURSE: 2 ... alpha rhythms erratic... Neuronal imbalance at critical threshold...\nNURSE: 3 Sir! Heart rate at critical!\nEDITOR: Your thoughts are as glass to me. You’re afraid — not for your life, in truth that was never yours to fear for. But for your precious Revolution. (a laugh) You said yourself the Nurse was safe. And if her Revision was successful, then your plans have failed. All the sacrifices you’ ve made have been for nothing. You didn’t make her a hero. You made her insane.\nCONSCIENCE: No... no! I won’t believe you! She got away, I know she did! She’ll remember!\nEDITOR: It doesn’t matter what you think. You’ve lost her. And all the pain you’ ve suffered. The lies you’ve lived. All that for nothing. Because I know everything about the Revolution. Everything.\nEDITOR: SUB-CONSCIOUS Sir, listen to me. Listen to the monitors! You have to stop now! If we push any harder we’ll induce a psychotic break. He’ll be out of your reach forever!\nEDITOR: All the dialogue reaches a crescendo here. Beat- just alarm bleeps from the monitors. The EDITOR closes a switch — the alarms stop. Silence.\nCONSCIENCE: (crushed) Revise me. Or kill me. I don’t care which. Without her it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. Just get it over with. Please.\nCONSCIENCE: Fade monitor and Box sounds back up slowly.\nEDITOR: If only you had applied this quality of dedication to our State. If only you’d realised that our State loves you with every bit as much feeling as you love your misplaced ideals. (beat) But you don’t. I see that now. (to the SUB-EDITOR) Alright. Pack up the equipment. You can all leave. Ill finish up here.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR Yes sir. Nurse. Help me.\nNURSE: 2/3 Of course. / Yes sir.\nNURSE: The SUB-EDITOR and NURSES pack up and leave. The EDITOR and the CONSCIENCE are alone together. The EDITOR shuts down the remaining equipment. KLUNK, KLUNK, KLUNK A descending whine like an old TV; valves ticking as the glass bulbs cool.\nEDITOR: So here we are. Two old friends, finally alone. What a dance you’ve lead me. I’m exhausted. But I’ve still got one surprise left. One last secret for you to take to the grave. Are you ready? Here it comes... (whisper) I believe. Not in the State. In your Revolution. I have for some rime. I wanted to help. But I’m the Editor. You’d never have trusted me. Especially not if ’'d spared you the pain you’ve been educated to expect. That’s why I tortured you. Now it’s over. There’s no reason to lie. (beat) Shortly you’ll be taken from this place, packed and shipped for Revision You’re going on a nice long Holiday. But before you go I wanted to have this time with you. To explain one last truth. (beat) ve been helping you all along... by arresting the revolutionaries, by Revising them instead of killing them, by allowing the Nurse to watch your arrest... more importantly, to remember it. Oh yes, She’s alive. At large, somewhere in the City. (beat) P’ve known for some time that someone tried to insert new memories into the Nurse’s last Revision process. I didn’t know it was you until now. If only you’d taken me into your confidence from the start we wouldn’t be having this conversation. By now the Hero personality would have been properly installed in the Nurse’s mind and the Revolution well under way. (beat) I understand why you didn’t crust me, of course. I’m the Editor. No greater symbol of loyalty to the State exists. Bur you must believe me now. It is your last chance. The Revolution’s last chance. I’ve been studying the Nurse. Attempting to strip away her Revised personality. The one you damaged.\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE is babbling hysterically now.\nEDITOR: Sshh. Sshh. Soon the pain will be over. And you’ll be gone. Bur [ll carry on your work. I'll free the Doctor from the Nurse’s mind. I'll make your Hero for you. (beat) All you have to do is tell me where you’ ve hidden the tape containing the Doctor’s reconstructed personality.\nEDITOR: A pain-filled gurgle. The CONSCIENCE is laughing.\nEDITOR: You don’t believe me.\nCONSCIENCE: Must think... me... fool...\nEDITOR: Listen to me. There’s no time.\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE laughs again.\nCONSCIENCE: Fool! Won ’t tell! Fool! Won’t tell! (continue with wild laughter under...)\nEDITOR: If you don’t tell me you are a fool! The Shipping Clerk will be here soon. Don’t you understand? You must tell me where the original memories are! Where you’ve hidden them. Only then can the Revolution succeed!\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE laughs.\nEDITOR: Do you want to die for nothing? Do you want her to die for nothing? Do you!?\nEDITOR: The CONSCIENCE just laughs and laughs. He tries to speak: broken words from a broken body and mind.\nCONSCIENCE: Editor... asked... a question... heh... arrest ... the... editor... arrest... the... editor!\nCONSCIENCE: The SHIPPG CLERK enters as the CONSCIENCE dissolves into sputtering laughter again. If the EDITOR was telling the truth, he’s missed his only chance.\nSHIPPING: CLERK I wasn’t expecting a live one. Restraints are extra.\nEDITOR: Ill sign for them personally. Just take him away.\nSHIPPING: CLERK Sign here then please. And here... and here. Thank you. Your receipt and tracking order. Initial here for anaesthesia.\nEDITOR: Of course. He shouldn’t suffer needlessly.\nSHIPPING: CLERK You know, I’ve been handling Revision shipping for years. I’ve never seen one come out of here laughing before.\nEDITOR: He thinks the last laugh is on me.\nEDITOR: The SHIPPING CLERK has no response.\nEDITOR: You can go now.\nEDITOR: The SHIPPING CLERK wheels away the still weakly laughing CONSCIENCE. A moment of quiet. When the SUB-EDITOR speaks his voice comes as a shock.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR There’s something you should know.\nEDITOR: (surprised) What- ? Don’t sneak up on me like that. Explain your presence here. I thought you had work to do.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR Ido. But...\nEDITOR: Speak up!\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR It’s the Nurse. She didn’t go home after the Conscience was arrested. A missing person report has been filed by her husband, the Engineer.\nEDITOR: I see.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR I await your instructions.\nEDITOR: Arrest the Engineer. Ship him directly for Revision. Find anyone who the Nurse ever spoke to. Anyone. Arrest them. Revise them. I want the Nurse erased from public memory.\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR (Overkill? Maybe) Of course sir. You instructions will be carried out at first light tomo-\nEDITOR: My instructions will be carried out immediately, Sub-Editor! I trust I make myself quite clear!\nEDITOR: SUB-EDITOR Of course, sir.\nEDITOR: The SUB-EDITOR leaves the Gallery.\nEDITOR: And so the Revolution begins...\nCLOSING: THEME MUSIC — END OF PARTTWO Establish, hold for a few bars, then MIX to a RADIO EQ and...\nSWITCH: OFF\nSWITCH: PART THREE\nSWITCH: Author’s Note In Part 3 the character of THE NURSE is still played by INDIA FISHER.

The EDITOR is talking with the FIRE CHIEF.\nEDITOR: Tell me what happened here.\nFIRE: CHIEF\nFIRE: Someone blew up the South Plaza Public Broadcast Screens. (a post-Revision memory? — maybe) They’re new you know. Hadn’t even cut the ribbons. (focusing) A good portion of the injuries occurred when the pylons came down. Crush injuries, gas burns from broken tubes, a few electrocutions. (hesitation) There’s something odd though...\nEDITOR: Tell me more.\nFIRE: CHIEF There’s something about the placement of the explosives... It was too precise... Whoever did this wanted maximum destruction, and knew how to get it.\nEDITOR: Explain.\nFIRE: CHIEF\nFIRE: Collateral blast damage was extensive. Several nearby offices were demolished, destroyed when the screens came down. And one entire hutch. Several hundred citizens were killed or injured.\nEDITOR: Several hundred... all citizens you say? Were any proles killed?\nFIRE: CHIEF No. The entire hutch was on day-shift.\nEDITOR: (putting it together) It’s a message. Someone is sending me a message.\nFIRE: CHIEF I don’t understand.\nEDITOR: The damage, the injuries... they were a by-product Accidental. Whoever did this wasn’t interested in killing. They didn’t want destruction. They wanted... silence.\nEDITOR: Something attracts the EDITORs attention.\nEDITOR: Someone’s watching us. There, by the rubble.\nFIRE: CHIEF I can’t see anyone. There’s too much smoke.\nEDITOR: Sometimes a criminal will return to the scene of his crime. To watch. To gloat. If there’s someone there it could be significant. Carry on with your work, Fire Chief.\nFIRE: CHIEF Of course sir.\nFIRE: The EDITOR walks away, skirting rubble and small fires. Sounds from the scene of the fire grow indistinct, obscured by the smoke. The EDITOR has some difficulty breathing. He sees something — or someone.\nEDITOR: You there! Stand still! (beat) Stand still I say! (beat) (A vocal noise — between an exhalation and a curse.)\nEDITOR: Whoever it is runs off The EDITOR gives chase. All sounds fade except for his running footsteps. He stumbles, hits a wall, cries out in pain, pushes himself off and continues running into...\nEDITOR: 3.3. EXT.ALLEY. MID-MORNING Wet concrete underfoot, slapback-echo.

He scrambles over crates and a fence into...\nEDITOR: 3.4. EXT. HARBOUR. MID-MORNING Gentle slap of water against wooden pilings. The EDITOR runs down the ramp to the stony beach. His footsteps falter as he slows, looking around for the NURSE.\nNURSE: (middle distance) I told you not to follow me.\nEDITOR: (angry) It is not your place to instruct! You are under arrest. Report for Revision immediately.\nEDITOR: No reply from the NURSE. The EDITOR moves cautiously up the beach and clambers under the Pier.\nEDITOR: As a Citizen it is your duty to obey the Editor and the State.\nEDITOR: Answer me immediately!\nNURSE: (suddenly close — a shock) You followed me.\nNURSE: I said you would die and you followed me anyway. You must really love me to do that.\nEDITOR: I thought you were safe.\nNURSE: You made a mistake.\nEDITOR: You’re a deviant and a terrorist! I’m here to arrest you.\nNURSE: You think I’ve done wrong. You’ve judged me. Only my Conscience can do that.\nEDITOR: Your Conscience is currently under Revision. The new Conscience has not yet taken office. [am Editor and Conscience pro-tern. And I am arresting you for harbouring fugitive memories and acts of terrorism.\nEDITOR: No reply from the NURSE.\nEDITOR: You can’t hide from me! (beat) Where are you? Answer me! (beat) Answer me immediately! (an exhalation — frustration and anger)\nEDITOR: The EDITOR clambers about under the Pier. His foot strikes something metallic. KLANK! A corroded old hatch cover. He knocks on it. BONG! BONG! It’s hollow. He pulls it open. Clambers inside.\nEDITOR: 3.5. INT. TUNNEL. NOON.\nEDITOR: A cramped, metallic acoustic Drips. Rats.

Rats scurry off.\nNURSE: -low roof.\nEDITOR: Show yourself!\nNURSE: You couldn’t see me anyway — all alone. In the dark.\nNURSE: The EDITOR bumps and fumbles around. His hand touches something unsavoury — it squeaks and scuttles away.\nEDITOR: Oh!\nEDITOR: I can’t hear you moving. You know this place. (beat) You’ ve been here before.\nNURSE: Is that a statement or a question? (beat) You’ ve been asking a lot of questions lately haven’t you? How do you feel about chat? (accelerating) Does it scare you? Anger you? Do you blame me? Do you want to kill me? Do you chink killing me will make everything right?\nEDITOR: (provoked) Questions! Always questions! By what right-! (regaining control with an effort) You are a dangerous and unpredictable social variable.\nNURSE: And I must be eliminated.\nEDITOR: Yes!\nNURSE: For the good of the State.\nEDITOR: Yes, for the good of the State!\nNURSE: Why did you let me go then?\nEDITOR: What? !I-\nNURSE: That’s what you cold the Conscience before you Revised him.\nEDITOR: How did you know what-\nNURSE: There are PR CAMS all over the City. All it takes is a portable Jukebox, some scissors and sticky tape, and a little ingenuity. You can learn anything you want.\nEDITOR: You bugged the Whispering Gallery? The Board will recommend execution for this. (no answer) Do you hear me? You’ll be dead!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR slams a fist against the tunnel wall. BANG!\nEDITOR: Where are you ? (Another blow — BANG!) Come out and face me! (And another — BANG!) You’re a coward! (And three more — BANG! BANG!

NO-TIME\nEDITOR: A vast acoustic Slight wind. Outdoors? Indoors? Can't tell Maybe it’s not even a real space at all. This is the first scene to use incidental music. The EDITOR screams as he falls. Scream and fall end in the same rubbery thud. BLOP!\nEDITOR: (hysteria) Now what!!?? (gathering his wits) Now what? A moment of quiet. Just rubbery noises as the EDITOR moves around.\nNURSE: (very close) There’s something you’ve forgotten.\nEDITOR: Wha-!\nNURSE: (distant) Something you need to know.\nEDITOR: You... you can’t...\nNURSE: (dose) Shall I tell you what it is?\nEDITOR: No! No you may not tell me — anything. I’m the Editor. I tell you.\nEDITOR: No reply from the NURSE.\nEDITOR: D’you hear me? J tell you!\nNURSE: (mid-distance) 1 think I will tell you. (close) You'll thank me for it. (distant) It’s very important.\nEDITOR: (moaning) No... no... no... no... no!\nNURSE: (close — frightening intimacy) Nurse knows best!\nNURSE: The NURSE begins to whisper. The EDITOR slowly racks up a despairing wail.\nNURSE: (dose) Listen to yourself (mid-distance) Trust your own voice. (very close) Your own mind. (distant) Think outside the box. (close) Get inside to get outside.\nNURSE: The NURSE’s whisper gets harsher with the EDITOR’s wail; each fuelling the other, both dwindling together. The EDITOR whimpers. A moment of quiet.\nNURSE: (distant) You’re lost.\nEDITOR: Yes.\nNURSE: (very close) You’ ve forgotten who you are.\nEDITOR: Yes! Help me, please.\nNURSE: I will. It’s what a Nurse does.\nEDITOR: What do I do?\nNURSE: Take my hand.\nEDITOR: I can’t see you, I can’t see your hand. All I can see is this endless grey nothing!\nNURSE: No. Oh no. You’re: quire wrong. It’s nor \"nothing.\" It’s everything. Everything your precious State forbids you to see. The State blinds us from birth to the wonders of a world beyond their control. I’m here to take the blindfold off. {sharp — a command) Open your eyes!\nEDITOR: But I’m already-\nNURSE: Look ahead. That’s right. Straight ahead. Tell me what you see.\nEDITOR: Are you deaf?

NIGHT The INFOTAINMENT is playing on the jukebox. The DJ is fussing over his discs and sleeves. He stops when the EDITOR comes in. They’ve never got along.\nTBA: DJ (trying it on, as ever) Studio One is on-air. Did you see the Receptionist for an appointment?\nEDITOR: (brusque — he’s not here to fence) A post-Revision Citizen in my purview has demonstrated memories she cannot possibly have. I have viewed the public transcript of a recent therapy session between a Nurse and her Conscience. The dialogue includes spoken questions. It is unedited. Unedited, do you understand? That can mean only one thing. The Censer did not receive the transcript before it entered the public domain. (accusation) All broadcasts and PR Cam recordings are routed through Broadcast House to their destinations.\nEDITOR: DJ I hope you’re not implying anything that might get you into trouble with the Board.\nEDITOR: (losing patience) Listen to me old man. Revolution is brewing in the White City. I can feel it stirring, drawing breath. Trying to hide while gathering its strength for the kill. (anger) The truth is an animal, voracious, blind in its hunger. It is a predator forever stalking new victims. Someone has let the truth out of its cage. My job is to put it back. (a threat) Or put it down.\nEDITOR: DJ\nEDITOR: How dare you threaten me! As DJ I occupy a position of responsibility second to none. My position is the keystone of this State. I was old when the Editor before you was Revised, when the Editor before him was born! This position exists by virtue of the Board and the Censor and you do not have the authority to question it.\nEDITOR: Your arrogance sickens me. This so-called \"office\" is a luxury the State can ill-afford. To vest such power in a single individual is utter folly. If you truly believed in your State you would have promoted a more responsible Citizen co DJ and submitted co Revision long ago. Your State would be better served and you would be happy.\nEDITOR: DJ As you are happy?\nEDITOR: Do not question me! Questions lead to unhappiness!\nEDITOR: DJ\nEDITOR: I am an old man. I don’t care what you think. You can’t threaten me and you don’t frighten me. (beat) You’re like a child, forbidden by repressive parents co learn and grow. You’re ignorant, opinionated, self-important, and ultimately worthless. I pity you.\nEDITOR: You presume too much on your much-vaunted \"office-\"\nEDITOR: DJ\nEDITOR: Hundreds of stacks. Thousands of shelves. Millions of records. Every one a take, some just a snippet of dialogue, perhaps a single perfect image; others entire mnemonic sequences. My job is to grade them, compile scenes, assemble rough cuts. To design sound and add a score, to sculpt\nEDITOR: from such disparate pieces a cohesive, functional and useful whole. I broadcast the approved product, and through each episode give life and meaning to the State. My job is the care and guidance of the Citizens. To lift and sustain them, to drive them in their work time, soothe them in their leisure time... I’m a priest, productivity my God.

There’s a Jukebox at the end of the aisle. Use the headphones. Witness the truth you seek so desperately. Then put chat truth back in its cage — if you can.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR takes the record from its sleeve and puts it on the jukebox. CRACKLE. The\nEDITOR: pulls on headphones and listens for a moment. The sound is muffled. After a moment he takes the headphones off switches off the jukebox and removes the record from the turntable.\nEDITOR: (horror) You're right.

Take no chances.\nEDITOR: The TROOPERS fan out into the stacks.\nEDITOR: SUB-CONSCIENCE Tell me again why this is necessary, Editor. This is an old man we’re dealing with. Tell me why you think he’s such a threat.\nEDITOR: You have no idea. A fist is not a threat. A gun is not a threat. A word is a threat. An idea is a threat. Ideas are patient. They like to grow. They live in the old. Those with time to think. To plan. The Disk Jockey should never have been allowed. He should have been Revised years ago. Decades. He is a very real threat to our State and should not be underestimated!\nTROOPER: (distant) Sub-Conscious!

The last few footsteps splash lightly.\nTROOPER: SUB-CONSCIENCE Well there he is, right where you left him. Mind the floor, sir, it’s still slippery.\nTROOPER: He’s dead sir. Suicide. He used this. Found it in his hand. Watch it sir. It’s sharp as a knife. Jagged too.\nTROOPER: SUB-CONSCIENCE\nTROOPER: (a poke) Well, Editor. Perhaps under the circumstances you’ll forgive me if I go on record with a question. (hard as nails) What kind of Revolutionary hero rips out his throat with a broken piece of his own record?\nTROOPER: MIX to RADIO EQ and FADE UNDER...\nTROOPER: 3.10. INT. BOARD OF CERTIFICATION. NOON.\nTROOPER: A Large chamber, a cold acoustic Fire crackles in a hearth. The BOARD is in session, a gestalt entity with one objective: the implementation of State Policy as set by their superior, the CENSOR. Together with the EDITOR, the BOARD MEMBERS have been observing the previous scenes on the Box. The record ends as the Box is switched off. KLUNK!\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 The Board of Certification wishes to express its surprise-\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 -its dissatisfaction-\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 -indeed, its very great displeasure-\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 -at the remarkable lack of foresight demonstrated by the Editor in regard to the investigation of this apparent \"Revolution.\"\nEDITOR: I can assure the Board that-\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 Our concern does not end with the destruction of State property or the murder of loyal Citizens.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 There are additional matters to discuss. Specifically-\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 -the matter of the Editor’s comportment and demeanour prior to and during the immediate crisis. As Editor-\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 -your du ty and responsibilities to the State are clear. And yet-\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 -records show your broadcast viewing time is considerably less than your licence requires.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Examination of your credit balance indicates you have regularly purchased more than the recommended amount of overtime.\nBOARDMEMBER: 3 You have used proscribed language.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 Discussed forbidden concepts.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Played uncensored music.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 Citizens who cannot conduct their business within the permitted time and language parameters are inefficient.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 Inefficiency leads to dissatisfaction.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Dissatisfaction leads to questions.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 We understand you have been asking questions, Editor.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 We'd like you to tell us why.\nBOARD: A moment of consideration.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 You may speak now.\nEDITOR: A moment of consideration.\nEDITOR: Don’t you see that?\nEDITOR: Why don’t you answer?\nEDITOR: The humming top is placed on the boardroom table...\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 We found this in your office.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 A child’s toy.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 A humming cop.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Please explain its significance.\nEDITOR: It belonged to the Conscience. It was taken from his home with other personal effects when he was shipped for Revision. I think it has something to do with the Revolution.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 There is no PR CAM record of such a toy in the home of the Conscience.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 This toy should have been recycled.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Like its owner.\nEDITOR: (slow burn) You think there is no Revolution. Were you not born with eyes to see? Minds to think? The top is a symbol. It goes round in circles, round and round, always moving but never travelling. It’s a metaphor for the State! And the symbol of the Revolution. Dormir comme un sabot. \"Sleep like a top.\" Don’t you understand? We’re all asleep! (fury) But now... now, the sleepers must awake! Break the symbol! Tear down the Revolution! Or everything we stand for, everything we love, everything... is lost! (softer — a desperate plea) Please, I beg you, in the name of everything I hold dear, please just let me do this one last thing. Let me find this Nurse, this... demon. Let me find her and bring her before you for judgement and punishment. Just let me do that and I'll willingly, happily, submit for punishment myself. Revision if necessary. Scan me! Bring the Box! Let me prove my loyalty and dedication. You know I speak the truth!\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Your honesty is not in question.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 But there are other considerations.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 You are obsessed.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Paranoid.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 You have allowed your \"love\" to overcome your judgement.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 We have seen it before.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Many times.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 There is but one course to follow.\nBOARD: MEMBER3 One action consistent with State Policy.\nEDITOR: No. I beg you!\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Revision!\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 Immediate. Total. Revision.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 Crimes have been committed in the board room!\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Summon the Conscience!\nEDITOR: (building under the above lines to a final desperate shout) No... this is mad... it can’t be... you\nEDITOR: can’t do this to me! I’m the only one! Do you hear me? The only one who one who can stop her! You have to let me stop her!\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Tell us why you think you’re the only one who can.\nBOARD: And of course, the EDITOR has no answer.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 You say you have been Outside the City.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 Everyone knows there is no Outside.\nBOARD: MEMBER I The Public Record shows it.\nEDITOR: (Trying to interrupt as the board batter him down) I... but... no that’s not\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 The Public Record shows you are lying.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 Or mistaken.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Or deluded.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 Or insane.\nBOARD: can find her! The only\nBOARD: ... (etc)\nEDITOR: Don’t try to tell me Outside doesn’t exist! I know it does! The Nurse took me there! Showed me things no-one has ever seen... she helped me to see... helped me to wake up. She freed me. Don’t you understand? That’s why she’s a threat! That’s why I have to kill her!\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 (swooping in for the kill) The Nurse for whom you have been searching so diligently was arrested and Revised several days ago — on your own orders.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 The Nurse showed you nothing. The Public Record proves it.\nEDITOR: (stunned) Wha-?\nBOARD: MEMBER 2\nBOARD: Your conversations with her were not real. The meeting she had with the Conscience on the docks did not take place. How could they when you had scheduled the Conscience for cross- referencing and Revision? They were all simply a fiction that you yourself created.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Props for your own — sadly broken — mind.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 The former Nurse and Conscience now serve in a more useful capacities.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 There is no Hero.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 There is no Revolution.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 There is only the chaos you have caused.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 It is your duty which remains unfulfilled.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 Your lies which threaten the State.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 Your obsession that must be ended.\nEDITOR: Are you suggesting... those explosions... the terrorist actions... were all my... No. You’re wrong. You’re all wrong. I didn’t kill anyone! She’s got his memories! The Doctor’s memories! She’s clever! She’s framed me and tricked you all! And now-\nMARCHING: FOOTSTEPS as the CONSCIENCE and TROOPERS approach the Office. They crash to a halt outside. There is a knock at the door.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 That will be the new Conscience. Enter!\nBOARD: The door opens. The CONSCIENCE enters. It’s the Revised NURSE (ie: CHARLEY). The\nBOARD: were telling the truth.\nCONSCIENCE: Please excuse this intrusion. The Conscience was summoned. Crimes have been reported here.\nEDITOR: (a psychotic break) No... no... this can’t be... it’s wrong... If not her then who?... I can’t be... Its’ not me... I love the State... I love... the... happiness... through acceptance. Happiness through Acceptance. Happiness through Acceptance... (etc, fade under...)\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Arrest the Editor!\nCONSCIENCE: Of course, sir. Please specify a charge.\nCONSCIENCE: The TROOPERS step forward as one.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 The Public Record will show he murdered the State DJ in cold blood after being exposed to an unCertificated Infotainment.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 He is to be packed and shipped for immediate Revision.\nBOARD: MEMBER 1 There’s no need to be gentle.\nBOARD: MEMBER 2 He’s been the cause of some inconvenience.\nBOARD: MEMBER 3 And after all, it’s not as if he’Il remember the pain.\nBOARD: The EDITOR begins to rant and struggle. He’s powerless against the TROOPERS.\nBOARD: MEMBER 4 Id say let this be a lesson to you, but I’m rather afraid you won’t remember it. Take him away!\nEDITOR: No. This can’t be true! I can’t be wrong! I’m the Editor! The Editor do you hear me? The Editor...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR is dragged protesting from the boardroom.\nEDITOR: 3.11. EXT. PLAZA WALKWAY. NOON High up. Some wind but not cold. The TROOPERS are struggling with the EDITOR.\nCONSCIENCE: Former Editor will match pace with the squad. Hesitation will be punished.\nEDITOR: Why are you doing this? Why is it a crime to ask questions? Why is it a crime to love?\nCONSCIENCE: It is not a crime to love.\nEDITOR: (building to a shout) No of course it isn’t... not when the object of our love is the all powerful White City!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR’s voice echoes from nearby buildings.\nEDITOR: That’s right. All you drudgers down there! Don’t you listen to me. ’ve committed the ultimate sin! I’ve asked a question! Who threatens your State? Your schedules and broadcasts? [ll tell you! Anyone who asks a question! Anyone who questions the law! Anyone who commits crimes to be happy! Root these traitors out! Bring them to me! I will punish them! Happiness through Acceptance! Happiness through Acceptance!\nTROOPER: Male subject has committed word-crime, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: So [hear. Gag this male immediately.\nCONSCIENCE: A short scuffle — the EDITOR breaks loose momentarily.\nEDITOR: You can’t even understand me can you? No wonder when half the words I’m speaking have been removed from your language! They don’t even let you have names! How can you betray the Revolution when none of you even have names?\nTROOPERS: run closer. Sensing the end is near; the EDITOR shouts even louder; trying desperately to get the attention of the PROLES below.\nEDITOR: Listen to me. Listen to my words. Words have been denied us for too long. Without words there can be no thought. Without thought there can be no understanding. How can you love without understanding?\nTROOPERS: make a grab for the EDITOR, who climbs onto the edge of the walkway.\nCONCIENCE: Former Editor will step back from the parapet immediately!\nCONCIENCE: A scuffle.\nEDITOR: I do this in the name of love!\nEDITOR: An EXPLOSION rips through the walkway. Debris. Fire. SCREAMS. The EDITOR runs from the TROOPERS, leaping the gap blown in the walkway as more of the edge crumbles away, making pursuit impossible.\nCONSCIENCE: He mined the walkway!\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE He jumped the gap! He’s getting away!\nEDITOR: (through the above) You'll see! T'Il destroy the Revolution! I'll stop the Doctor! I ‘Il save the White City! And I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!\nEDITOR: And the EDITOR is off, baring it through the flames as more of the walkway comes down on the heads of the stunned PROLES beneath.\nCLOSING: THEME MUSIC — END OF PART THREE Establish, hold for a few bars, then re-tune to...\nCLOSING: PART FOUR\nCLOSING: Author’s Note: In Part 4 the character of the NEW-EDITOR is played by [C WESTMAAS] (The NEW\nEDITOR: is the REVISED CONSCIENCE from Part 2)\nEDITOR: The part of the CONSCIENCE is played by INDIA FISHER.

NIGHT Heavy rain on the pier overhead. Ragged breathing. Coughs. It’s the EDITOR. He’s in a bad way. Drenched, starving, exhausted. He’s talking to someone.\nEDITOR: (a mantra, almost) No-one understands. No-one can see the danger they’re in. I can’t understand it. They’re so complacent. So well-meaning and yet so misguided. Not you though. You understand, don’t you? Of course you do. You and me, we’ve got — sshhh!\nTROOPERS: march along the nearby harbour wall The EDITOR falls silent. The TROOPERS pass. The EDITOR picks up right where he left off.\nEDITOR: You and me, we’ve got imaginations. We understand the danger. But it’s cold and I’m hungry. And I have so much to think about. To plan. To achieve. Together we will endure. (ragged irony) We might even prevail (recovering ftom a breathless laugh) You wondering how you can help. It’s alright, I can tell I’m a people person, you see, I know a thing or two. Come here. Just a little closer. That’s right. Here. Right up here to the blood and-\nEDITOR: A sudden flurry of movement and furious squeaks. The EDITOR catches the rat he’s been luring with his own blood. He breaks its neck. A sound like wet sticks snapping. He rips out the animal’s throat with his teeth, chewing greedily on the meat.\nEDITOR: (chewing and slurping) — 1] explain... mm... how you can... mm... help.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR consumes the rest of the rat. MIX to RADIO EQ and FADE UNDER...\nEDITOR: 4.2. INT. OFFICE OF THE CONSCIENCE. DAY The CONSCIENCE and the SUB-CONSCIOUS have been watching the above scene.\nEDITOR: SUB-CONSCIENCE I feel almost sorry for him. Under the pier like that, trapping rats with his own flesh... disgusting.\nCONSCIENCE: I'd watch that attitude, if I were you, Sub-Conscious. Unless you want to replace the former Editor as Number One on the Most Wanted List.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Of course, Ma’am. My apologies. (beat) It’s just that-\nCONSCIENCE: (a warning) Understanding can be an effective tool. But when you’ve been Conscience as long as I have you’ll realise it’s a double edged sword. Understanding leads to empathy. And the last thing a Conscience needs are feelings.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE I understand.\nCONSCIENCE: Good. Now enter the camera data into the Box.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Immediately, ma’am.\nCONSCIENCE: The SUB-CONSCIENCE switches on the Box and enters the data.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE Let’s see... Public Record CAM number 3578299236... location... City Harbour... the Old Pier... pre-meridian... there...\nCONSCIENCE: You’re wondering what we’re collecting this data for.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE My place is not to wonder, Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: Nothing in life is ever truly random. The former Editor has eluded arrest long enough for his movements to begin to show a pattern. Patterns are informed by habits. With enough data, habits can be predicted.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE We’re making a map.\nCONSCIENCE: Indeed we are. A map of the human heart.\nCONSCIENCE: SUB-CONSCIENCE I don’t understand. We could simply arrest him when he next appears on the public record cameras.\nCONSCIENCE: Yes we could do that. But I want tuy find out where he goes when he’s off the public record cameras...\nCONSCIENCE: The EDITOR turns off the Box. KLUNK!\nEDITOR: Ill consider it my privilege to give you that information.\nEDITOR: SUB-CONSCIENCE Conscience! The Editor He’s-!\nEDITOR: A short, sharp scuffle. The SUB-CONSCIENCE goes down. THUD! As crape as the EDITOR picks up the SUB-CONSCIENCE?’s truncheon. The CONSCIENCE jumps up, knocking her chair over. The EDITOR bangs the truncheon against the table threateningly.\nEDITOR: Don’t move! (beat) Now. Move back to the desk — slowly! Good. Now sit down.\nEDITOR: A moment of tension. The CONSCIENCE picks up her chair and sits down.\nCONSCIENCE: Everything that happens in this room is recorded.\nEDITOR: Everything that happens anywhere is recorded. How else could your — habits — be so predictable? (chuckle) Its’ amazing what you can do with some scissors and sticky tape, a portable Jukebox and a little imagination. (clicks the scissors for effect) And don’t worry about the Sub- Conscience. He has a thick skull. He’ II live.\nCONSCIENCE: You’re lucky he’s not dead.\nEDITOR: Or he’s unlucky. Depends on your point of view, doesn’t it? Please don’t get up.\nCONSCIENCE: Listen to yourself. You asked a question. Illegal! The Board were right about you. You’re driven by obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The thing you’re hunting doesn’t exist — except inside you. You’ve become the thing you — uuhh!\nCONSCIENCE: The EDITOR knocks the CONSCIENCE out with the truncheon. SMACK!\nCONSCIENCE: 4.3. THE BEYOND.NO-TIME The EDITOR has brought the CONSCIENCE here. She’s beginning to come round.\nEDITOR: You can stop pretending now. I know you’re awake. I didn’t hit you that hard.\nCONSCIENCE: Where-? Tell me where I am.\nEDITOR: I call it... the Beyond. It’s a place... outside the City.\nCONSCIENCE: Outside? How is that-? (recovering quickly) Tell me how that can be.\nEDITOR: Listen. No-one can see you here, no-one’s watching. You can say and do anything you like. Anything you want. There’ll be no repercussions. No punishment. Ask a question. Go on. See what it feels like.\nCONSCIENCE: I can’t... why... have you blindfolded me?\nEDITOR: Your eyes are open.\nCONSCIENCE: (a rush of panic) Then why can’t I see anything? Why... is it all the same colour? Why are there no shapes ? Why-\nEDITOR: That’s enough! It’s not Jubilee.\nCONSCIENCE: What’s... ? (ie: \"going on?’’)\nEDITOR: Think outside the box.\nCONSCIENCE: I don’t understand.\nEDITOR: You think you see nothing. In fact you see everything. Everything you couldn’t see inside the White City. Everything you couldn’t hear, or taste or smell or touch. An entire world. But you’ ve no language to describe what you see, no experience to relate it to. So it doesn’t register. Your mind sees nothing, hears nothing, feels nothing.\nCONSCIENCE: You’re mad. A criminal. This is some kind of deviant trick. You think you can use me to help the Revolution. It won’t work.\nEDITOR: Listen to yourself. Listen to that paranoia. That’s our glorious State chanting its National Anthem through you. \"You’ve become the thing you worship.\" (ironic chuckle) Sound familiar?\nCONSCIENCE: Let me go. Let me go and I’Il see you get-\nEDITOR: -a fair hearing? Curiously enough, that’s precisely why I want to keep you here. I’ve been alone in this place for too long. I’m afraid I’ve developed some rather radical notions. But it’s so hard to be objective these days. I need someone to discuss them with. (harder) You’re my Conscience and I need you. There’s no other reference for me here. Without you I'll never know if I’m right or merely insane. (softer) Will you help me? Will you be my Conscience one last time? It is your job after all.\nCONSCIENCE: Talk then! But you’re just avoiding the inevitable. Happiness-\nEDITOR: -Through Acceptance. I know. I know... (beat) I found this place... it feels like a long time ago. But time moves differently here. It doesn’t seem so... important. The work periods, the Infotainments, the Voice... they all seem a very long way away. And yet... they must be close because... well, maybe I just think they’re close...\nEDITOR: The EDITOR takes the spinning top from his pocket. He rattles the plunger up and down a few times.\nEDITOR: I took this from the former Conscience.\nCONSCIENCE: A child’s toy.\nEDITOR: A humming top.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR gets a lazy rhythm going on the plunger. The top makes a tinny scraping noise as it slowly revolves.\nEDITOR: The Board wanted it destroyed. Recycled.\nCONSCIENCE: Tell me what... Why is it so important?\nEDITOR: It has something to do with the Revolution. I don’t know what. But I know when I make it spin like this I feel... calmer. Soothed, almost. Perhaps... perhaps it’s some kind of auto- suggestion... a memory fragment left over from a forgotten childhood. A reminder of more comfortable, more stable days...\nCONSCIENCE: Your behaviour is neither calm nor stable. You’ve blown up buildings. Killed Proles and Citizens. Kidnapped your Conscience. Why?\nEDITOR: (sharp) I don’t know! (softer) I don’t know...\nCONSCIENCE: I understand. Come with me. Leave this place. I can help you. Together we can forget all these things that trouble you so much.\nCONSCIENCE: The top is spinning/aster now. The scraping noise more and more insistent.\nEDITOR: But I don’t want to forget. I want to remember.\nCONSCIENCE: How can you say that? You were the Editor!\nEDITOR: I want to remember everything. I want to remember who I was before I was me. Don’t you?\nCONSCIENCE: No! No I don’t! It’s forbidden! Anyway, it’s too dangerous. We can’t have people remembering things they shouldn’t. It’s bad for them. What’s bad for them is bad for... I mean what’s good for... They wouldn’t be happy! Happiness Through Acceptance!\nCONSCIENCE: The top is much louder now, as the EDITOR cranks it faster and faster. And it’s beginning to make a ghostly humming sound. WHUOOM-WHUUUQOOOM WHUOOM-WHUUUOOOOM The sound is affecting the CONSCIENCE.\nEDITOR: We are a species predated from cradle to grave. From our waking thoughts to our sleeping dreams there is no escape.\nCONSCIENCE: I don’t...\nEDITOR: Every person alive today is a battleground. A war is being fought in our heads every moment we exist. A conflict so violent it can destroy individuals and nations alike, yet one fought with weapons possessing no weight or mass, no moment of inertia, no quantifiable physical presence whatsoever.\nCONSCIENCE: What...?\nEDITOR: Even ideas have a natural history. Evolutionary trends. Passive and aggressive species. I’m talking about predatory concepts. Ideas that attack, engulf direct the actions of the host mind, spread by simple contact through language and movement; consuming and converting social and ethnic groups, even entire species in the name of survival, of progress.\nCONSCIENCE: That’s...\nEDITOR: An example: you and I, talking together about this idea I have. An equal exchange you might think. You might even think you can choose whether to believe me or not. (she'd be wrong if she did) 'm exposing you. Infecting you. The concept is in control. Iam merely its vector. Your only protection is how stupid you are. The problem is that stupid people make mistakes, and die. Evolution deselects them for survival. Which only leaves intelligent people. And intelligent people, people who understand things more readily and are more flexible, are by definition more susceptible to infection by new ideas.\nCONSCIENCE: I feel... that sound... what...\nEDITOR: By keeping the people stupid, you prevent the spread of infectious ideas. The State has kept us stupid. You, me, everyone. For generations. We’re living in a box, quarantined, prisoners of an endless today. Isolated from infection by tomorrow.\nEDITOR: The top is spinning really fast now ,the humming noise rising in pitch and volume to a near- painful climax.\nEDITOR: When a humming-top is at the acme of its gyration it becomes so steady and quiet that it doesn’t seem to move. In this state it is said to sleep. Dormir comme un sabot. Everyone alive today in the White City is asleep. Everyone. Except you and me.\nEDITOR: For the first time, the top reaches the acme of its gyration. A smooth, warm, harmonic humming.\nEDITOR: Toys, people, everything is reclaimed, Revised. A closed loop, endlessly repeating. If it were a mind, the State would be in fugue, psychological retreat, endlessly fleeing the predator future. Break the cycle!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR grabs the top, stopping it dead. Shocking silence.\nEDITOR: And you break open the box.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR begins whirling the top again, slowly at first but with increasing speed.\nEDITOR: (in time with the plunger) Infection... ideas... change. (beat) Time... begins... again.\nEDITOR: The effect of the top’s humming noise on the CONSCIENCE is remarkable. She begins to regress through various personalities.\nCONSCIENCE: ... what have you... that sound... oh... my head I... stop it! That noise, I can’t... ohhh... I-\nCONSCIENCE: -don’t see how, darling. This is a new Season. Maybe the writers are getting lazy. A little post- Revision therapy will probably do me the world of good!\nCONSCIENCE: This is what happens when you don’t listen to regular infotainments. This is what happens when you lie about your broadcast license.\nCONSCIENCE: You can’t be together for as long as we have without being in love, you know.\nCONSCIENCE: I was blinded by love of course. But you don’t understand what love is.\nCONSCIENCE: I want you to report this matter. I don’t believe in secrets. Secrets breed questions.\nCONSCIENCE: And now this! This use of questions. Questions Breed Questions.\nCONSCIENCE: Questions lead to answers. Answers lead to knowledge. Knowledge leads to freedom. Freedom leads to dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction leads to unhappiness!\nCONSCIENCE: Soon we’ll never have mer. We’ll be happy again.\nCONSCIENCE: The State wants all of its Citizens to be happy. J want to be happy. I-\nCONSCIENCE: -I’d be as happy as a hermit crab with a new boot for a home if I...\nCONSCIENCE: -am happy, I...\nCONSCIENCE: -bright. So warm. Like the tropics. It’s making me fed tired.\nCONSCIENCE: (as the DOCTOR — easy confidence) Like children, we’re here to learn.\nCONSCIENCE: No, of course not! The Dalai Llama is a religious leader. A Buddhist. They believe in reincarnation, you know.\nCONSCIENCE: If we learn well during our life we’re rewarded with Nirvana.\nCONSCIENCE: Human souls are eternal. If we’re good in life we’re rewarded with eternal life after we die.\nCONSCIENCE: If not we’re reborn in a new body to try to accomplish what we failed to learn the first time round.\nCONSCIENCE: Doctor — you tell him!\nCONSCIENCE: Easy as falling off a log.\nCONSCIENCE: Don’t let me fall!\nCONSCIENCE: And how many bodies have you had now?\nCONSCIENCE: The EDITOR stops pumping the top. The ghostly humming fades as the toy slowly winds down and topples over.\nCONSCIENCE: How many bodies have you... have you... uuhhbh...\nCONSCIENCE: It’s too much. The CONSCIENCE can’t deal. A shuddering sigh as she’s overwhelmed by memories the humming top has brought to lift. The sigh builds, stopping abruptly just short of a scream as the EDITOR grabs the CONSCIENCE by the shoulders and shakes her hard. And now we realise the trap the EDITOR has sprung.\nEDITOR: Listen to me. I need the tape. The Doctor’s memories, as collated by the Restoration Group. Where is it hidden? You must know. You must remember! Tell me where it is! Tell me where it is or by everything I hold dear I'll kill you where you stand!\nCONSCIENCE: (as CHARLEY) Doctor? What are you doing? My head... The memories... on a tape... the Nurse... she hid it... I hid it...\nEDITOR: I know you hid it! Tell me where!\nCONSCIENCE: (as NURSE) In the top. It’s inside the spinning top. It’s here. You’ve had it all along.\nCONSCIENCE: Drained, near collapse, the CONSCIENCE groans and sinks to the ground.\nEDITOR: (a triumphant roar) At last!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR batters the top against the ground, peels back flaps of tin skin and rips out the clockwork innards with his bare hands. A cassette tape.\nEDITOR: I told you I’d kill you. I told you [’d kill you!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR stamps on the tape. Grinds it into the ground. The DOCTOR’S memories are destroyed. Forever.\nCONSCIENCE: (flipping between the DOCTOR and CHARLEY) Doctor wait... what are you doing?... those are my memories. You’re destroying myself!\nEDITOR: What are you raving about? Never mind! Just get up!\nCONSCIENCE: What...? Where are you taking...?\nEDITOR: Back of course! Back to the White City and the Ministry of Tourism.\nCONSCIENCE: Oh no. You don’t understand... No... no... it can’t be... that can’t be true... (etc)\nEDITOR: What? You thought I was pro-Revolution, is that it? Some misguided zealot seeking freedom and truth to use as weapons against an overwhelming oppressive force? Well I’m afraid you’re very much mistaken in that belief!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR hauls the CONSCIENCE to her feet.\nCONSCIENCE: (Charley and the Doctor mangled together) No. Listen to me. She’s the Doctor. You have to believe you! Please remember... you have to, don’t I see? It’s vital! Everything depends on it!\nEDITOR: You’re all the same. You’re all mad. All deluding yourselves. None of you understand what love is, what self-sacrifice is. No-one loves the State like Ido! And now I’m going to prove it.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR begins to walk the weakly struggling CONSCIENCE along.\nCONSCIENCE: Oh why won’t I believe me! If we go back there we’ll never get away!\nEDITOR: (rising to a shout) Youll see. You'll all see! And when I’ve given them the leader of the Revolution, and shown them the tape of the Doctor’s memories which I have destroyed... well then Ill surrender for Revision myself!\nEDITOR: The EDITOR stops walking for a moment. The CONSCIENCE, exhausted, gathers her strength for another shout. Instead...\nEDITOR: (almost a whisper) And have ever y moment of this living nightmare erased from my mind — forever.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR hustles the CONSCIENCE along again.\nCONSCIENCE: (finally stable as CHARLEY) Look. You’re — I’m Charley. Charley Pollard. You’re the Doctor. We travel together. With C’rizz, don’t you remember? No. Of course you wouldn’t. I’ve got your memories... some of them anyway... oh dear... this is all so...\nEDITOR: (building again) The ultimate sacrifice! Not that you’ll be there to see it. You’ll be gone by then. All gone. Neatly and properly Revised. A place for everything and everything in it’s place! Now keep walking!\nCONSCIENCE: Dear God, Doctor! Please don’t take me back there! I can’t go through that again! Don’t you understand? If they revise me again I’II die! Doctor please!\nCONSCIENCE: The EDITOR drags the protesting CONSCIENCE away. MIX to RADIO EQ and FADE UNDER...\nCONSCIENCE: 4.4. INT. MINISTRY OF TOURISM. THE WHISPERING GALLERY. MORNING The EDITOR is restrained. The NEW EDITOR (ie: the Revised former CONCIENCE — or C’RIZZ, in other words) is interrogating him.

I sense we’re very close now... close to the truth...\nEDITOR: Protect the State! Happiness through Acceptance! Productivity through Happiness! (a moment of epiphany) Happiness through Death!!\nNEW: EDITOR There! Alright. Increase Anaesthesia five points. But no more. I don’t want him to get away. Not now. Not when we’re so close...\nNEW: The SUB-EDITOR administers the electronic anaesthesia. The EDITOR comes back from the edge — but not by for.\nEDITOR: (reducing to a mumble) Death... Death is the natural order... change... the only constant... freedom... the only... death... brings... help... I want to help... I have to find them... C’rizz and... and... Charley... Oh Charley... (rising to another shout) Charley, what have they done to you? What have they done to you!\nNEW: EDITOR\nNEW: The Conscience has been Revised. As you correctly surmised she was a rebel element and has been eliminated. She was quite far gone, ac the end. She thought she had a name of all things. She thought she was \"Charley.\" She begged for a Doctor. (chuckle) Perhaps I’Il make her one.\nEDITOR: Not a Doctor...\nNEW: EDITOR I can’t hear you. Please speak up.\nEDITOR: Not a Doctor. The Doctor. She wanted the Doctor.\nNEW: EDITOR Ah I see. She evinced a desire to be with her \"hero\" her psychological cushion. A means of accepting Revision, the termination of her current ego.\nEDITOR: He’s dead.\nNEW: EDITOR Louder please.\nEDITOR: (jerky — a clockwork robot running down) The Doctor. I killed him, killed the tape! Stamped on it, crushed it. Destroyed his memories.\nNEW: EDITOR\nNEW: Then the danger has passed.\nEDITOR: The Revolution has passed. I destroyed it!\nNEW: EDITOR So you believe. But I think there’s more. A deeper level. Motivations perhaps hidden even from yourself. You did after all commit acts of heinous terrorism before you were apprehended.\nEDITOR: Did I? Did I really? Or did I just dream I did?\nNEW: EDITOR The blood of many is on your hands. You’ve no idea of the extensive Revision necessary to erase the personal tragedy, the public outcry, the very culture shock that you caused.\nEDITOR: You have no way of being objective. What if it’s your memories which have been altered — to believe I am a terrorist? How would you know?\nNEW: EDITOR I wouldn’t. Of course. But it doesn’t matter. My job is to act on what is currently real.\nEDITOR: Reality is a function of memory. Change the memory and the reality changes right along with it.\nNEW: EDITOR An interesting point of view. But discussion of any form of solipsism is illegal. I’m afraid I won’t be able to continue this conversation any further. Professional ethics forbid it.\nNEW: In his madness, the EDITOR is tickled by this absurdity.\nEDITOR: What then shall we do? Play while the ship goes down? Fiddle while Rome bums? (bitter) I saved the State. I did my duty. I demonstrated my loyalty and my love. You have no idea of the pain I’ve suffered, the sacrifices I’ve made... (continue under...)\nNEW: EDITOR There. There! Good... Now we’re getting to it.\nEDITOR: (angry) ...All for our beloved State! All for you! Because I love you! And now I want my reward. I want Revision. Revise me, damn you, Revise me right now! (softer) Please. I can’t bear it. I want to forget. (loud again) I have to forget!! (soft) How else will I ever love again? (whisper) How else will I be happy?\nNEW: EDITOR (warm) L understand. And I will authorise Revision for you, I'll be glad to. Soon the pain will be gone. All you have to do is cell me one thing. Just a small thing, really.\nEDITOR: Anything. I'll tell you anything! Just — don’t let me fall... Don’t let me-!\nNEW: EDITOR (interrupting) Tell me the names of your friends in the Revolution.\nEDITOR: No... no you don’t understand! Haven’t you listened to me? I killed the Revolution! I killed it!\nNEW: EDITOR Tell me the names of the Restoration Group!\nEDITOR: They’re dead! I killed them, I blew up their hutches, their offices. I killed the DJ! They were my acts of terrorism! Not destroying a few public broadcast screens. That was just collateral damage! An accident! The Revolution is dead! They’re all dead! (sobs — quieter)They’re all dead. They’re all dead, they’re all dead... (fade under...)\nNEW: EDITOR (something doesn’t add up) No... no, no, no. (to EDITOR) Tell me how you knew who they were, where they lived and worked.\nEDITOR: You self important fool, I remembered them! How else do you think I- (sudden understanding) Oh. Oh. The toy. The spinning top. The sound it made triggered a memory regression in the Conscience. But I-\nNEW: EDITOR Yes. You’d already heard that sound.\nEDITOR: What did Iremember? Tell me what I remembered!\nNEW: EDITOR There’s no need for me to tell you. See for yourself. Witness your own memories of the event. The root of your obsession. Sub-Editor: tune the Box!\nNEW: The SUB-EDITOR retunes the Box to the EDITOR’s memories. The sound of a humming top begins, peaks, then fades under...\nNEW: 4.5. EXT. WHITE CITY. PLAZA. MORNING (FLASHBACK)\nNEW: The DOCTOR, CHARLEY and C’RIZZ are looking around in breathless amazement at the beautiful architecture and exquisitely landscaped parks. PEOPLE everywhere. A normal day. Apparently.\nNEW: THE DOCTOR\nNEW: (fading in) ... tell you if I lived here I'd be as happy as a hermit crab with a new boot for a home! Don’t you think Charley? C’rizz? Look at the architecture, the gardens. Magnificence unequalled by anything since the splendour of Rome. What a place for a holiday. I can’t imagine anything bad ever happening here.\nCHARLEY: It’s all so bright. So warm. Like the tropics.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ It’s certainly consistent. More variety might be nice...\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: You know, I think you could be right. A splash of Pollock to point up the mid-tones, a hint of Breughel to deepen the shadows. Yes. I think that’d be a definite improvement. Maybe I'll suggest it.\nCHARLEY: To whom?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Oh... whoever’s in charge. You know.\nCHARLEY: Don’t I just. In the meantime, Doctor, I don’t suppose you have such a thing as a sunshade in those pockets of yours?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: (rummaging) Hm. Yes, should have something or — (a machine pistol) — oops, well, not that obviously — (something futuristic and very dangerous) — or that — (a handful of little clockwork robots) — er, sorry — yeucch. (rotten apple) Where did that come from...? (more junk, all dropped on the ground)\nCHARLEY: Ooh! A humming top. [ had one like this when I was little. Can I keep it?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Oh, er, yes, of course, now er... (sunglasses — hoorah!) — ah! Finally. Here. Try these. Until you get used to the light.\nCHARLEY: Ray Bans.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: (child-like delight) Yes, look. You can squash them and they just bounce right back into shape. Squash. Bounce. Squash. Bounce. (happy sigh ) It’s the little things that make life worth living. Don’t you think? Charley? Charley?\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ She’s over there. Admiring the fountains.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Oh. Oh really? Oh.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR tries unsuccessfully to cram all the junk back into his pockets. He misses one of the clockwork robots, which marches chirpily away across the plaza... THE DOCTOR runs after it and C’RIZZ follows on.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR (calling) Charley? I say — could you be so kind...?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR approaches CHARLEY and the fountains.\nCHARLEY: (coming closer) I beg your pardon? Oh yes. Your little stray. Don’t panic. ve got him.\nCHARLEY: scoops up the toy robot and hands it back to THE DOCTOR, who throughout the next few lines amuses himself switching it on and of€ idly imitating the bleeping noises it makes under his breath.\nCHARLEY: Here you are.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Thanks. How’s the view?\nCHARLEY: Much better through these Ray-Bans. Have you got another pair for C’rizz?\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ It’s alright, Charley. I don’t need them.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Compound eyes see things a little differently than you or I.\nCHARLEY: Yes, of course, I’m sorry. How easily one gets used to... I mean, how quickly one forgets you’re not... mean... um...\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ\nCHARLEY: (amused by CHARLEY ’s embarrassing faux pas) It’s alright. You’re both just as odd to me as I am to you. I think it’s the lack of mandibles. Or maybe it’s that you don’t regurgitate before meals.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR finally gets bored playing with the toy robot and switches it off.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Vive la difference, Charley. Vive La difference.\nCHARLEY: Just not at dinnertime. There are limits. Doctor what are you-\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: Do you think anyone’ll mind if I have a quick paddle in the fountain? (taking off shoes and socks) You humans. You’re so funny. On the one hand you have Einstein, the Dalai Llama, toasted tea cakes... on the other... (jumps into fountain) ... you run squealing at the sight of a little pre-digested-\nCHARLEY: Yes, thank you Doctor, that’s really quite enough dinner table conversation for one day.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ The Dalai Llama. That’s some kind of animal?\nCHARLEY: (amused, authoritative and almost completely misinformed) No, of course not! The Dalai Llama is a religious leader. A Buddhist. They believe in reincarnation, you know. It’s very pagan.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ Pagan.\nCHARLEY: Yes Pagan. The old gods. Christianity teaches rebirth as well, of course, but not in the same way as the Buddhist Faith. But both claim human souls are eternal. If we’re good in life we’re rewarded with eternal life after we die.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ Isn’t that a contradiction? To be rewarded with life... only after your life has ended?\nCHARLEY: (out of her depth) Yes, well, ’'m not saying it very well. Doctor — you tell him!\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: Buddhism is a relatively simple philosophy, C’rizz. Like children, we’re here to learn. If we learn well during our life we’re rewarded with Nirvana. If not we’re reborn in a new body to try to accomplish what we failed to learn the first time round. Easy as falling off a log.\nCHARLEY: (a good-natured prod) And how many bodies have you had now?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Yes, well, that’s beside the point Charley. Anyway, C’rizz, I think you’d get on rather well with the Dalai Llama. As a monk yourself, I mean.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ You... you know...\nDOCTOR: Yes, C’rizz. (QUIETLY) And I understand what you did in the Kromon biosphere. It must have been devastating for you. I’m sorry. If there’s anything I can-\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR is interrupted by a nearby CITIZEN.\nCITIZEN: Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to Broadcast House?\nCITIZEN: C’RIZZ I’m sorry to say we’re strangers here ourselves. But I’m sure one of these other people could-\nCITIZEN: (interrupting) What are you?\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR C’rizz? Oh he’s just a Eutermesan.\nCITIZEN: C’RIZZ \"Just a Eutermesan\". I can see it on my tombstone now -\nCITIZEN: (interrupting — to the DOCTOR) What’s that you’re holding?\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR\nCITIZEN: This? (bleeps from the robot) It’s just a toy. We call it a robot. (a kid with a football card) Actually it’s a \"Robbie the Robot\" 1963 collectible based on a movie: called- (ie: \"Forbidden Planet.\")\nCITIZEN: (interrupting again — to CHARLEY) What’s chat you’re holding?\nCHARLEY: This? Just another toy. A humming- (ie: \"top.\")\nCITIZEN: (interrupting sharply) Why is it red?\nCHARLEY: Well, it’s a child’s toy. It’s painted with-\nCITIZEN: (rising frenzy) What are the pictures of?\nCHARLEY: Um. Well, that’s a-\nCITIZEN: (cascading demands — a rising frenzy of hysterical free-association) Are they licensed ? Are they censored? What do they mean? What is your name? What is your name? (continue under...)\nCITIZEN: C’RIZZ Uh, C’rizz, I-\nCITIZEN: (unbroken flow) Why are you a different colour to them? What are you doing here? Have you come for the Jubilee? Have you seen it before? Do you think you’ll enjoy it? Why are you wearing clothes? How did you come here? Did you walk? Did you fly? Do you like to swim? Why are you in the fountain? Is water blue where you live? Is the sky green? Are there birds? Are there fish? (continue under)\nCHARLEY: (under the above — a bit scared) Licensed? Censored? Doctor, what on Earth is he...?\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR It’s alright... I don’t think he’s dangerous. Just a little... (ie: Odd? On edge?)\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ Perhaps there’s a hospital nearby.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR\nCHARLEY: Never jump to conclusions, C’rizz. On this world it may be how they say hello. (to CITIZEN — hesitant but gathering confidence) How do you do? What is your name? Why are you here? Have you come to see the Jubilee?\nCHARLEY: By now the CITIZEN is in full flow. THE DOCTOR ups the ante to match. He’s not connecting, though.\nCITIZEN: (a torrent of words -almost meaningless) What do you eat there? Do you cook your food? Do you eat it raw? Do you like salt? Have you got forks? What about tables? What are they made of?\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR (free-associating as intensely as the CITIZEN) Is the sky blue? Do the birds fly quickly? Is salt white? Do you play marbles? Can you walk on the grass? Does smoke get in your eyes?\nCITIZEN: (sheer hysteria) Is it plastic? Is it metal? Is it wood? Is it green? Is it legal? Is it hard? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is? Is? Is? (etc)\nCITIZEN: By now it’s clear the CITIZEN is nuts. What was odd and a little amusing is now actually quite Scary.\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR (giving up) This is ridiculous. He’s worse than a scratched record. Maybe you’re right, C’rizz. Perhaps there is a hospital... around here... some... hm...\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR tails off, attention caught by an air-raid siren.\nCITIZEN: THE VOICE\nCITIZEN: This is the Voice of the White City. Attention. Welcome to your new work day. Today is a Jubilee day. Citizens may celebrate for one hour without arrest or punishment. Happiness Through Acceptance. Welcome to your Jubilee day. (repeat and fade under...)\nCITIZEN: (not a word so much an incoherent utterance of shuddering ecstasy)Ju... bi... lee-ee-ee...!!\nCITIZEN: The CITIZEN jumps into the fountain, pushes the Doctor over and runs off through the water. The toy robot gurgles and fizzes despondently.\nCITIZEN: THE DOCTOR Oh thank you very much.\nCITIZEN: CHARLEY and C’RIZZ help the Doctor up.\nCITIZEN: C’RIZZ Here’s your shoes and socks.\nCHARLEY: (highly amused) At least they’re still dry.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Hm. Yes. Very funny I’m sure.\nCHARLEY: THE VOICE\nCHARLEY: (still repeating) This is the Voice of the White City. Attention. Welcome to your new work day. Today is a Jubilee day. Citizens may celebrate for one hour without arrest or punishment. Happiness Through Acceptance. Welcome to your Jubilee day. (etc)\nCHARLEY: Jubilee? With processions and everything? Oh goody! I haven’t seen a procession since-\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR (a warning) Charley, I don’t think that’s quite what they mean.\nCHARLEY: C’RIZZ Listen!\nCHARLEY: A sound has been growing in the background. A ROAR.\nCHARLEY: That’s a big crowd. Do you suppose we’ll see any Royalty ? I wonder what they look-\nCHARLEY: A PROLE crossing the Plaza suddenly runs screaming at CIIARLEYand pushes her aside. She falls into the fountain.\nPROLE: (absolute hysteria) Who am I? Where do I come from? Who was my father? Why is the sky blue? Why is it that fork? Why use glue? What’s for dinner? (etc etc: fade under...)\nPROLE: THE DOCTOR (a momentary poke) Well there’s a perfect example of tit-for-tat if ever there was one.\nCHARLEY: (to DOCTOR) I beg your pardon. (to PROLE) Look what you’ve done! What do you think you’ re-\nCHARLEY: The PROLE runs off into the distance. A moment of tension. The distant ROAR builds to sudden hysterical pitch as a stadium-sized CROWD pours into the Plaza. Screeching, yelling, performing acts of unspeakable violence upon each other, their voices drown even the wailing sirens. And the odd thing? — they’re all screaming questions at the tops of their lungs. Pertinent, abstract and downright surreal. Anything and everything. A celebration of the question mark. People with months of restriction suddenly removed. A pressure valve. A literal explosion of who, what, where why and how. (NB: Ask the performers to improvise here!)\nCHARLEY: Doctor — Help I— Oh!\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR and C’RIZZ inundated by the CROWD.CHARLEY is knocked down again. SMACK! She falls back into the fountain. SPLASH!\nCHARLEY: (gurgling) Doctor...!\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Charley! C’rizz help me! She’ll drown if we can’ t- Charley, quickly! Take my hand!\nCHARLEY: Doctor! I can’t reach you! I’m slipping! Don’t let me go!\nCHARLEY: Splashing in the fountain, the crowd spills over them. Chaos.\nDOCTOR: What are you — get away from her!\nCHARLEY: Don’t let me fall! Don’t let me fall!\nCHARLEY: CHARLEY’s voice is swallowed up by the CROWD.\nCHARLEY: THE VOICE\nCHARLEY: This is the Voice of the White City. Attention. Welcome to your new work day. Today is a Jubilee day. Citizens may celebrate for one hour without arrest or punishment. Happiness Through Acceptance. Welcome to your Jubilee day!\nCHARLEY: Build the sound of screeching and questions, louder and louder. People are fighting too. SMACK! SMACK! MIX to RADIO EQ and FADE UNDER...\nCHARLEY: 4.6. INT.OFFICE OF THE CENSOR. DAY. (FLASHBACK) The DOCTOR and the CENSOR are watching the previous scenes on the Box. Throughout this scene the CENSOR becomes progressively more affected by the Jubilee.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR (dazed) Look at the screen. It’s a nightmare. Everyone’s gone completely mad.\nCHARLEY: He wrings out some wet clothes.\nCHARLEY: THE DOCTOR Sorry about the carpet.\nCENSOR: It can be cleaned. You’re safe for the time being. You were lucky to reach the Town Hall. Few escape the Plaza at Jubilee.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR The Town Hall. Yes. I remember the brass plaque on the plinth outside... The Office of the Censor... That’s you I take it?\nCENSOR: The shore against which all sin breaks.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Sin? (sudden understanding) The questions!\nCENSOR: Precisely!\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR The violence. It’s city-wide?\nCENSOR: Oh yes. What would be the point otherwise?\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR But the damage... how many... will die?\nCENSOR: Perhaps as many as several thousand. The exact figure is Censored, of course. More will be injured. The ratio is generally around 8:1.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Generally? This happens often?\nCENSOR: Every quarter.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Every...? What about my friends, Charley and C’rizz? Have your officers found them yet?\nCENSOR: I’m afraid there’s no news. The Public Record cameras gather information ceaselessly. But there are thousands of them. Millions of hours of footage.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR And right now there’s no-one to collate the information. All your officers are out there. (bitter) Having fun.\nCENSOR: You want me to tell you more. Why this happens. What it’s all for.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Yes. Yes, you’re right, I do! It’s an outrage! An abomination! Social experimentation on this scale is... is... (no words)\nCENSOR: This is why there are no visitors to the White City. No-one from outside understands our way.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR How long has it been like this?\nCENSOR: (sudden anger) You ask too many questions! You ask as if you have a right to answers! This is our State. Our City. You were allowed to live only to help us! (recovering) I apologise. The Jubilee... it is hard to remain... it is hard to be... calm...\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR\nCENSOR: A trade. I understand. My memories for my friends’ lives.\nCENSOR: And their memories also, when we find them.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR It’s blackmail.\nCENSOR: Call it what you will — so long as you agree.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Even though we came here by accident and mean you no harm?\nCENSOR: I serve the State. As Censor my purpose is to guide this new world, to shape it’s growth, to allow it to be all that it can be. I understand your concern for your friends bur my loyalties lie elsewhere. Do not ask me to sympathise with you. I care only for the Body and Mind of the State.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR And what of the Soul?\nCENSOR: The Soul! Of course, the Soul. Critical mass! That’s what we need. A critical mass of life experience. Only then can this perpetual madness serve a meaningful end.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR Our minds... our memories... all just pollen. To fertilise your society.\nCENSOR: On any other day the use of analogous reasoning would be punishable by Revision. Today...\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR ... it’s just the simple truth.\nCENSOR: Yes.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR (beaten and he knows it) Then don’t ask me to sympathise with you!\nCENSOR: (losing control to the Jubilee) I ask only for your memories. Experiences. All that you are. To shape all that we can be. Is that so much to ask? For their lives? Isn’t the truth that you would give anything to save them? Because you love them?\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR I would’ve helped you if you had simply asked.\nCENSOR: You agree then.\nCENSOR: THE DOCTOR (angry) Of course I agree!\nCENSOR: (a shout) Summon the Conscience! Alert the Editor! Prepare the Whispering Gallery for a new production! (quieter- some reverence) Thank you, Doctor. (real weight) You will be remembered.\nCENSOR: MIX to RADIO EQ and FADE UNDER...\nCENSOR: 4.7. INT.OFFICE OF THE CENSOR. DAY. (PRESENT DAY) The NEW-CENSOR and the EDITOR are watching the previous scenes on the Box. (The NEW-\nCENSOR: is the Revised NURSE, ie: CHARLEY.)\nEDITOR: I remember... yes... [remember now... (fade under next line)\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR Everyone remembers in the Office of the Censor.\nEDITOR: (not really listening) ... had... a plan...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: (a little more sharply — to get the EDITOR’s attention) Of course you did. To make us think you were working for us and then reveal to the public whatever secrets you discovered here in my office. To incite the Citizens to Revolution, bring down the State. Of course you had a plan. You admitted as much yourself during your interrogation.\nEDITOR: You’re right. I was going to tell them everything. Whatever secrets I found out. But this... I knew you were hiding something, but this... to know I volunteered for this nightmare... that I allowed my memories to-\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: ... Shape the infant consciousness of an emergent species. Yes. A magnificent gesture. The Doctor was a true Hero and his sacrifice ennobles us all. (beat) Oh, by the way. You can take that portable Jukebox out of your pocket. No don’t switch it off. You can record anything you like. You’ll just get better signal-to- noise ratio if the microphone isn’t covered.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR puts the portable jukebox on the table.\nEDITOR: You knew. All along you knew.\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: Not me personally. But the Censor, yes. And as the New Censor, I have inherited that legacy. (a casual question) Where do you suppose we put all the memories we remove from those we Revise?\nEDITOR: (splutters helplessly — it’s an obvious thought but one he’s never had.) 1 suppose we... I mean I assumed they were... well, discarded. Destroyed.\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: (a chuckle — how naive) As the New-Censor it is my job to remember the things everyone else has forgotten (beat) For example — your plan to capture the Nurse, to have her Revised, to end the Revolution. That was expected. (beat) What neither of us expected was that she — I — the person who thought herself Charlotte Pollard — would be Revised to be the New Censor. That was a surprise to both of us, I think. (beat) Yet we should have expected it. Think back to when I was the Female Prole, before you Revised me to be the Nurse. Tell me what the Box found in my mind during my cross-examination.\nEDITOR: I... (remembering) \"The deeper levels. Like Russian Dolls, nested at the cerebellum...\" (fade in the Box tuning signal and SFX montage from part 1) \"... The mammal brain, the reptile brain... each a more primitive stare than the one before... deeper and deeper... further and further back... until... until...\" (abruptly — realization dawns) \"No. Not a barrier. At least, not completely. And not going backwards. Think of the other sounds. Childbirth. That’s a sound associated with the future. Add this to the sounds of construction. Yes. Yes, see it clearly now. This female wants to give birth — to the future! Sees herself as mother and architect — of the future!\" (SFX stop abruptly) (understanding) Oh!\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: And now here we are. And I am the architect of your future. For I will let you create it for yourselves. We’ll be partners in this birth, you and I. Mother and Father to a new society. A new State of being.\nEDITOR: (still out of his depth) But... if you knew the truth... why didn’t you...?\nEDITOR: I’d come here planning to broadcast everything I found out to the citizens. Whatever secrets I found out. But this... I knew you were hiding something, but this... to know I volunteered for this nightmare... that I allowed my memories to be...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: ... to shape the infant consciousness of an emergent species. Yes. A magnificent gesture. In providing critical mass the Doctor was a true Hero and his sacrifice ennobles us all. (beat) Oh, by the way. You can rake that portable Jukebox out of your pocket. No don’t switch it off. You can record anything you like. You’ll just get better signal-to-noise ratio if the pick-ups aren’t covered.\nEDITOR: The EDITOR puts the portable jukebox on the table.\nEDITOR: You knew about this? My plan?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: Of course I do. The Censor knows everything. Your plan to bring us the Nurse, make us think you were working for us and then to go public with whatever secrets you found out in the Office of the Censor. To incite the Citizens to Revolution, bring down the Stare. Of course I knew. You admitted as much yourself during your interrogation.\nEDITOR: Bur... if you knew the truth... why didn’t you...?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: Think about it and you’! understand. The success of any social group rests upon a fundamental truth: if the time is right for change, then change will happen. Every so often a Revolution is required. Social evolution demands it.\nEDITOR: (dazed) Social...?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR There have been revolutions in the past. There will undoubtedly be more in the future. How else can we scale the cultural plateaux?\nEDITOR: (confused) Plateaux...?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR Like the Doctor you have a simple, obsessively driven and somewhat naive world-view.\nEDITOR: Obsessive...?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR The truth is often more complex than we can imagine... and always too big to be used as a mere tool.\nEDITOR: Tool...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR Like bulldozing an office block to crack a walnut.\nEDITOR: Office...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR Where’s the meat in that? Buried under a thousand tons of rubble.\nEDITOR: (Beginning to get the point.) Rubble...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: Social. Plateaux. Obsessive. Office. Tool. Rubble. Six words that define your role in your culture. (old memories) I remember what it was like to be you. I remember the confusion, the pain. So long ago... so clear. (focused again) As Censor I am merely the guide on life’s path. I can show you the tracks, suggest a direction of travel. But I can’t tell you which one to take. Think of me as a parent. I'll nurture you, guide your formative years, even try to control your adolescence. But I can’t tell you what to do for ever. Sooner or later you’re going to have to start\nEDITOR: making decisions on your own. If you want peace, have it. If you want a Revolution, have that. The choice is yours now. You’re all old enough.\nEDITOR: What if we’re not ready?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR (a chuckle) I haven’t let you fall yet.\nEDITOR: And the Board? The Editor? The Conscience?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR Children need structure when they’re young. But they grow fast. And soon they make their own structure. And decisions. And... become adults. (eg:) What did you see beyond the White City?\nEDITOR: What did I... Isaw... (Trees? Libraries? Peace? War? Space travel? A universe to travel in?) Potential. (a real struggle to get the ideas out) For good, for evil. Everything we could be, and everything we mustn’t be, all mixed up together in the same... at the same... (can’t say \"time.\") (Understanding ? Acceptance, maybe?) A rainbow. (laugh) I saw a rainbow!\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR (sensing a breakthrough) A rainbow... An infinity of colour from a single tone... Yes... you might just be ready.\nEDITOR: (can’t quite ditch his suspicion) Ready? For what?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR To be the new me. The new Censor. To guide our people to a new social and political order. To help them find their soul... their future... perhaps at the end of some cosmic rainbow.\nEDITOR: (sensing a trap) No. You’re trying to trick me. I’m the Doctor. I have to find Charley and C’rizz. They’re in danger! You want to control us! Steal our memories!\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR (gentle) You are those memories. The Doctor and his friends left the White City a very long time ago.\nEDITOR: What? But I’m -\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR (inarguable truths) — the Doctor has two hearts. C’rizz is a reptile. Charley a mammal. They’re\nEDITOR: bipedal.\nEDITOR: Bi...\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR\nEDITOR: Two arms. Two legs. Tell me how many limbs you have.\nEDITOR: (A shock.) Eight of course. I-\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR And how long do they live?\nEDITOR: The Doctor? Centuries. Even his friends live for decades...\nCENSOR: A hundred of our generations would not fill a single one of their years. We are small and we stand on the shoulders of giants. They are the giants.\nEDITOR: (acceptance — finally at peace) I understand. I... I can’t be the Doctor. Nor physically, you’re right. I knew that... Bur in my heart... (sadness) What happened to them? The Doctor... Charley, C’rizz. Did they die?\nEDITOR: NEW-CENSOR You could ask that question for the test of your life and never get an answer. They left this place and passed into memory. Into urban myth. No-one will ever know what happened to them.\nEDITOR: A moment of reflection. In the background, a rumble — throughout the scene a CROWD has been gathering outside the building. Outside, the giant screens are showing a live playback of the conversation between the EDITOR and the CENSOR, recorded and broadcast by the EDITOR’s pocket jukebox. The truth is out of the cage.\nEDITOR: 4.8. EXT.PLAZA.DAY The CROWD are listening to previous scene playing out on screens. Anticipation.

What fate have I wrought upon the world I love? What have I done? What have I done?\nEDITOR: The EDITORs questions are drowned as the roar of the CROWD rises to fever pitch. Questions piled on questions. Screams. Smashing glass. Distant explosions. Collapsing buildings. And tens of thousands of PEOPLE screaming questions... worse even than Jubilee... and then... as if that’s not enough... the sirens begin to howl. Only now do we realise how much like the eerie sound of a child’s humming top they are.\nEDITOR: THE VOICE\nEDITOR: (on screen) This is the Voice of the White City. Attention.

Welcome to your Jubilee-\nEDITOR: An explosion. The screen falls. The CROWD have pushed it over. The VOICE is silenced forever.
