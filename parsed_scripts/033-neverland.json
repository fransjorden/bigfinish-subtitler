Are you alright? Have you broken anything?\nDOCTOR: I nearly broke an intergalactic pudding-eating record on Maruthea a few bodies ago, but right now — no. Well, nothing a hot bath and a king-sized tub of liniment won't cure.\nCHARLEY: What happened back then?\nDOCTOR: Oh. Right. As I was saying — ow! — the TARDIS was riding the tail of the time slippage we experienced. The Time Lords won't have been able to predict our route — terribly jumbled co-ordinates, you see, that's why it feels like we've been tumble-dried. And now —\nCHARLEY: Yes?\nDOCTOR: — now, we've been beached up in the wake of the slippage — (GETS UP, CROSSES TO CONSOLE, FLICKS SWITCHES) — so let's just see where and when that might be...\nCHARLEY: (TO HERSELF) Well, I may be none the wiser, but I dare say I'm better informed.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Vectors stabilising ... a-ha! That's only a few hundred light-years off- course! (TO CHARLEY) Now. Before I was so rudely interrupted, I promised you a surprise. Tell me, Charley, how long have you been travelling with me in the TARDIS?\nCHARLEY: It's not all that easy to keep track — but, well, a good six months, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Which means... ? (BEAT ) Something that's terribly overdue? Something extra-special? Oh, come on, Charley!\nCHARLEY: (DRY) I haven't got the faintest idea, but I'm sure you're going to tell me.\nDOCTOR: It means that it really is way past time we... I mean, it must be round about... Oh, look: it's like this. (BEAT) Happy birthday, Charley.\nCHARLEY: (INCREDULOUS) Happy birthday?!?\nDOCTOR: Happy birthday! And what tends to happen on birthdays, hm? (BEAT) Parties! Parties! I like parties, don't you? And I happen to think that the best assistant in the Universe deserves the best party in the Universe — so that's where we're going!\nCHARLEY: I'm sorry, you've lost me. Could we start again?\nDOCTOR: (OBLIVIOUS) Sumaron Era, dateline 9235 point three! The Jovian Fold! The Millennium Mardi Gras! You see, the Jovians — a lovely race of people, trust me — decided to celebrate the\nDOCTOR: 8\nDOCTOR: billionth span of their civilisation with a party lasting a thousand years inside a very discreet little space-time fold — which, quite coincidentally, the Time Lords know absolutely nothing about. And just as well! It's the party to end all parties and we don't want killjoys in the kitchen! The most exclusive event in history — and guess who's got an invite? (BEAT) You, Charley, you! You are going to have a ball. I'm actually quite jealous.\nCHARLEY: I'm going to this amazing shindig — and you're not?\nDOCTOR: Only one invite, I'm afraid. I told you it was exclusive. Besides... you don't want a neurotic old nine-hundred-and-fifty- something cramping your style! Let your hair down! Go wild! There's a suite booked at the best hotel in town — I'll pick you up in a year or so!\nCHARLEY: One year!?!\nDOCTOR: Not long, I know, but it was the best I could do at such short notice. (BEAT) Oh, cheer up! You'll love it — I promise?\nCHARLEY: (SARCASTICALLY) So what will you be doing while I'm whooping it up in the back of beyond?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well. Things. Nothing for you to worry about.\nCHARLEY: (COLD) You're going to see the Time Lords, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: No, no, of course not! Why in the Seven Galaxies —\nCHARLEY: (CUTTING IN, ANGRY) Don't lie to me, Doctor! It's written all over your face!\nDOCTOR: (FLATLY) Is it? (BEAT) Oh, Charley — don't turn away. It's for the best. I just have to go and sort things out with President Romana, see what all this is about. It won't take long. And then, well, I'll be back and —\nCHARLEY: This is about me, isn't it? The break in the Web of Time caused by me surviving the crash of the RIOI. It's not over, is it? It's nothing to do with the Nimon, or the Daleks — it's me, and you know it!\nDOCTOR: I don't know it, Charley. But I'm very much afraid that's what the Time Lords might think. They've been tracking the TARDIS for some time now, you see — hovering on the fringes of the Vortex, waiting for their chance to pounce. I couldn't understand why they didn't just haul us back to Gallifrey. But they're scared, you see — scared of any random factor, any tremor in causality — and they don't want any of that back home, oh no. They have to preserve the Web of Time and any chink in the Web, however slight, they fix it. It's their job.\nCHARLEY: You think they'll put me back on the R101, don't you?\nDOCTOR: I think that they might think that was the simplest option, yes. But I won't allow that to happen. I need to go to the Time Lords, talk to them — explain. I won't let anyone hurt you, Charley. Whatever it takes. Whatever the cost.\nCHARLEY: (BITTERLY) ‘Happy birthday,' he says. 'Happy birthday: Charley.’ Only it isn't my birthday, is it? It isn't my birthday because I'm not supposed to have any more birthdays. No more cake, no more candles, no more presents, not now, not ever. No more birthdays since —\nDOCTOR: (SADLY) Oh, Charley ...\nCHARLEY: - since I died. That's right, isn't it, Doctor? No more birthdays because I'm supposed to be dead, dead and burned in the wreck of an airship. Born on the day the Titanic sank, died on the RIO1. Poor, tragic little Charlotte Pollard, her life snuffed out before it had even begun — that's how it is, isn't it, Doctor? (BEAT) And now you want to hide me away in some knees-up at the end of the universe while you go and risk God-knows-what at the hands of the Time Lords on my behalf. Why's that, Doctor? Why? It's not your problem. It was me who wanted to see the world. It was me who stowed away on the RIOI. It was my choice, Doctor, my own stupid fault. Should have stayed at home that day, but I didn't. And that's that.\nDOCTOR: But what if it isn't? What if it doesn't have to be like that?\nCHARLEY: (ANGRY) But it is like that! (BEAT; SOFT, SOOTHING) Oh, you. You know who you remind me of? You're Peter Pan — the little boy who never grew up, who lived in Never-Never Land\nCHARLEY: 9\nCHARLEY: and fought with pirates and pixies. Nanny used to read me Peter Pan. I wanted to be Wendy. And now Iam. Wendy Darling, having adventures in fairyland with the boy who never grew old. But, you see, Wendy grew up in the end. That's what's so sad. And poor Peter, poor little Peter, left all on his own —\nDOCTOR: He didn't forget, Charley. He'd never forget. And he never left Wendy to face the crocodiles alone.\nCHARLEY: You're so sweet, so kind, so caring. Too good to be true, like a dream. And all this is just dreaming. These adventures we've had, these scrapes and japes in Never-Never Land, with monsters and ray guns and magic — they've been wonderful. Better than my wildest dreams. But you can't hide in dreams. Everyone wakes up in the end. It's time to stop dreaming, Doctor. Time to grow up.\nDOCTOR: Charley, I— I don't know what — (PASSIONATE) I won't give up, Charley! Not now, not after all this time! Please, Charley — let me help you. Let me face this for you. Whatever it takes I'll put it right and —\nCHARLEY: (INTERRUPTING, AS IF APROPOS OF NOTHING) Doctor remember this switch? The one marked 'Fast Return’, the one I used to get us out of the Nimon problem? If I remember your description correctly, it sends the TARDIS back to its last spatio-temporal location.\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) Charley, will you please just listen to m— (THE PENNY DROPPING) Fast Return. Don't touch that - Charley: no!\nCHARLEY: Sorry, Doctor. It was my choice to get on board that airship. It's been a fantastic ride — but now it's time to get off.\nCHARLEY: (SADLY) There is no alternative.\nDOCTOR: NO!!! (FRANTIC SWITCH-FLICKING) Can't stop it! We're going back —\nCHARLEY: — back into the path of the Time Torpedoes. (FX:ROARING OF ENCROACHING TORPEDOES) I'm going to meet the Time Lords. Can't wait to see Gallifrey, at last.\nDOCTOR: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOQOOOQ0OOOOO0OOO0O0000000\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE TORPEDOES HIT.

(DEEP BREATH; CONSOLE EFFECTS CLEARLY HEARD ) What has he done to the inside of this capsule?\nKURST: Looks like an Ormelian brothel.\nLEVITH: Like you'd know. (BEAT) Now, where —\nLEVITH: 10\nKURST: Here, Levith. This him?\nLEVITH: Dressed like a retrograde. Must be. (BEAT) How long has this capsule been frozen?\nKURST: Only a few hundred years.\nLEVITH: Seasoned traveller. Adjusts quickly. He's back with us, see?\nDOCTOR: (WEAK, BEFUDDLED) I tell you, Lord Byron... you're meddling with forces you don't understand — (TRAILS OFF)\nLEVITH: He's ready for transport. Is that the Earth girl?\nKURST: Yes. (FX: CHARLEY BREATHING ) She looks almost intelligent. (BEAT) Must get lonely, rattling about in a capsule this old. You don't suppose he... indulges?\nLEVITH: Kurst, that's disgusting. (BEAT) You'll have to ask our Madam President.\nKURST: She knows him?\nLEVITH: You haven't heard? She went renegade for a while, travelled with him.\nKURST: 'Travelled'?\nLEVITH: Travelled. And that's all she did. If you know what's good for you, that is. (BEAT) The girl will live. Better bring the equipment in, hook her up to the time/space converter.\nKURST: And the Doctor?\nLEVITH: Yes, 'the Doctor'. The Doctor has a date with the President herself.\nDOCTOR: (GROGGY) Mary, Mary — you must believe me. That man is not your brother! He — (BEAT; SURPRISED) Oh! Oh. Not Switzerland, then. Some sort of... chamber. Dark. (FX: GETS UP. FOOTSTEPS ON METAL FLOOR ) Hello? Hello? (FX: TAPS METAL WALLS ) Metal. Triple-bonded polyesium with tinclavic relief, if I'm not much mistaken. (ALOUD, AS IF TO AUDIENCE) Unusual composition. Very unusual. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it was specific to the hull of one particular Gallifreyan vessel — a Class Seven Supra-Orbital Time Station. (BEAT) Well? Am I right? (ANGRY) Show yourselves!\nDOCTOR: Ah! Do you mind? Those lights really are terribly bright...\nVANSELL: (HEARD FROM ABOVE LEFT ) Class Seven-C, actually, Doctor. But in all other respects you are, of course, infuriatingly correct.\nDOCTOR: Oh, now there's a voice I recognise! (FAIRGROUND BARKER PATOIS ) Come on! Don't be shy! Step forward Celestial Intervention Agency Co-ordinator Sevansellostophossius, hif yew pur- lease! (MOCKING) Oh, I'm sorry. I forget — you never were all that keen on the 'ostophossius' bit, were you? Terribly common. Prefector Zorac came up with something rather better, if I remember right...\nVANSELL: If you really think I will be in the least bit affected by any sordid reminiscence relating to our time in the Academy all of six hundred years ago...\nDOCTOR: (EXPLOSIVELY) 'Nosebung'! That was it! Nosebung! Hm. Or was it 'Toastrack'?\nVANSELL: (PAINFULLY CONTROLLED) That wasn't me, Doctor, and well you know it.\nDOCTOR: You're quite right, Vansell. I do apologise. (UNDER HIS BREATH) No need to get sniffy. (BEAT; ALOUD) This isn't an impromptu reunion, then? No Ushas, no Koschei, no Jelpax or Magnus? No more of the Deca?\nVANSELL: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (RESIGNEDLY) So what does the Agency want?\nVANSELL: Charlotte Elspeth Pollard. Human. Born Hampshire, England, on the fourteenth of April, 1912. Died Bee-or-var-iss, France —\nDOCTOR: — that's 'Beauvais’, actually —\nVANSELL: 'Beauvais', thank you. Died Beauvais, France, on the fifth of October 1930, aged eighteen years, five months and twenty-one days.\nVANSELL: 11\nDOCTOR: And?\nVANSELL: And then: traced to deep space freighter Vanguard, 2503; Venice, Earth, 2294; the republic of Malebolgia, Earth, 2003; New York, Earth again, 1938; London, oh look, Earth ... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And all despite having died in Beauvais, France, on the fifth of October 1930, in the wreck of a dirigible known as the RIOI. What an intriguing anomaly.\nDOCTOR: On behalf of Charlotte Elspeth Pollard, I invoke the right clearly stated in the Archetryx Convention to be tried by an independently-assembled commission of the Temporal Powers. Harm one hair on her head in malice, Vansell, and I'll hound you to the end of reality.\nROMANA: (FROM ABOVE RIGHT) And I'll gladly assist you, Doctor. But there's no chance of it coming to that.\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED ) Romana! Or should that be Madam President? Whatever. Romana, will you kindly tell Co-ordinator Nosebung to stop sticking his snout in where it's not wanted?\nROMANA: It's not quite that simple, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I get it. Bad cop, good cop; good cop, bad. Have you prepared my confession? Shall I sign it now?\nVANSELL: (TO ROMANA) 'Good cop, bad cop'? This is an Earth colloquialism?\nROMANA: (TO VANSELL) It usually is. (TO DOCTOR) Doctor, I give you my promise: I will not sanction any random justice or injustice against your friend Charlotte Pollard.\nDOCTOR: Friends call her Charley.\nROMANA: Charley, then. She's still in your TARDIS, and safe.\nVANSELL: At least, as safe as anyone — now.\nCHARLEY: (WOOZY) What — where —\nLEVITH: (BUSINESSLIKE) (FX: BLEEPS OF EQUIPMENT) Disoriented? Not surprising. You just sit tight in your nice Earth chair.\nCHARLEY: Who are you? And — (REALISING SHE'S STRAPPED IN) — \\et me out of these straps! Where's the Doctor? What have you done with the Doctor?\nKURST: (TO LEVITH) Thalia's bones! Are all humans this noisy?\nLEVITH: (TO KURST) I've only met a few.\nCHARLEY: Please! It's me you want. Wherever he is, whatever you've done to him, it's not his fault — it's mine. I'll do whatever you want so long as he's safe.\nKURST: (TO LEVITH) Loyal, isn't she? Interesting, that.\nLEVITH: Kurst, you're obsessed. (TO CHARLEY, ENUNCIATING SLOWLY SO CHARLEY WILL UNDERSTAND) Don't you worry, Earth girl. Your friend the Doctor is all right. My name is Levith, this is —\nCHARLEY: (JUST AS DELIBERATELY) — Kurst, I know. I am not subnormal.\nKURST: (AMUSED, TO LEVITH) Oho! Picked up some tricks from her master...\nLEVITH: Drop it, Kurst. (TO CHARLEY) We represent the Celestial Intervention Agency. We're not going to do you any harm. We need to prepare you for a small ... procedure. So long as you don't resist, it won't hurt at all.\nKURST: We can't guarantee that, you understand. But if it doesn't work, Earth girl, you won't live long enough to feel the pain.\nLEVITH: Then again, neither will we.\nCHARLEY: (WAILING) No!\nCHARLEY: 12\nVANSELL: Doctor, tell us how you first escaped the Time Torpedoes?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well. You know. Improvisation, genius, a well-turned trouser, a rapier wit ...\nROMANA: (REPROACHFULLY) Doctor ...\nVANSELL: A wave of time distortion, hm?\nDOCTOR: Time distortion? Oh! You've brought me here to talk about time distortion? (BRIGHTENING) Well, I'm your man! I've been warped and flipped and slipped and spun through more temporal phenomena than a Mexxonian Dragon has had hot dinners!\nVANSELL: But this particular type of time distortion — you have encountered it several times recently, have you not?\nDOCTOR: (CAREFULLY) Time factors do seem to have played a large part in my life of late — but that sort of slippage, no. At least, I don't think so.\nVANSELL: Then I suggest you pay closer attention to what's going on right beneath your ... nose. We at the Agency have observed that very form of slippage many times over the last few quarters. Gallifrey's scientists have been struggling to categorise it. In many ways, it behaves quite unlike any other form of causal disturbance ever before detected. But one possible explanation has presented itself in one of the more esoteric branches of academia. The research was suppressed, naturally.\nDOCTOR: (MOCKING) Naturally.\nROMANA: The distortion fits a thesis which has been among the Thinking Circles for a long time — one which has never been accepted into our Codex of Disciplines. (BEAT) 'Anti-Time.'\nDOCTOR: Ha! 'The spider in the Web of Time' — that old chestnut? Romana, 'Anti-Time' has been around longer than the Flat Galaxy Society, but it's given far less credence!\nVANSELL: Officially.\nDOCTOR: Now, how does it go? 'The Web of Time could not exist until the great Rassilon built the Eye of Harmony, the hitching-post of chronology, that which does not flux nor wither nor change its state .. .'\nROMANA: 'The Eye of Harmony created a universe of ‘positive’ time, finite time. Gallifrey anchored the continuity of the universe. But just as matter has its counterpart in anti-matter, just as every action has an equal and opposite reaction, then, by all the immutable laws of the universe, positive Time — the Web of Time — must have its shadow ...'\nDOCTOR: “Anti-Time\" ... as intractable and destructive a force to causality as anti-matter is to space. Something with no past, no present, no future ... a perpetuity of meaningless chaos, a now with no beginning or end.'(BEAT) Elegant, brilliant, thoroughly logical — and utter gibberish. I've been trolling about the Space/Time Vortex for a lot longer than any of you. If there really was another plane of cause and effect, don't you think that maybe, just maybe, after all these centuries, I might have noticed?\nROMANA: The Web of Time is stretched to breaking. Observe the screens. (FX: BUZZ OF\nELECTRONIC: DATA) We see time slippage in the Sensorian Rumanian and Sumaron eras. The Fifty Years' War of the Kosnax and the Uhrai is now into its third century. In the Ring System of the Veta Worlds, stones, and not reptiles, are emerging as the dominant life form. Earth was barely stable untll this nexus, when the wrong President was elected into executive control of this major land-mass ...\nVANSELL: The Agency no longer has enough operatives to maintain continuity across the universe, despite a draft of the Temporal Powers. History is leaking like a sieve.\nROMANA: If we plot these slippages back, however, a remarkable pattern emerges. We see the earliest major wave of distortion centred around the planet Earth in the 1930s ... then deep space 2503; back to Earth in 2294, 2003, 1938, 1906 and so on; each outbreak sees the distortion expanding, sometimes trailing off, but most usually infecting histories wherever it goes.\nDOCTOR: You talk like it's a virus.\nROMANA: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: (SLOWLY) And you think ... Charley is the carrier?\nROMANA: Not exactly. But she might be Patient Zero. (DARK) If the universe of Anti-Time was real, Doctor, if it were an actual place, how do you suppose it might be accessed?\nROMANA: 13\nDOCTOR: I don't know. Some kind of gateway? A rip, a tear, a breach... a hole?\nROMANA: (GRIMLY) Go on.\nDOCTOR: (AGHAST) Charley?\nVANSELL: In itself, the Earth girl's survival is not the problem. She was nothing. She would amount to nothing. Her descendants would be nobodies. She's nothing special, Doctor. She wouldn't go on to cure a disease, or start a war, or discover a planet. By rights, her survival would be but the tiniest hiccup, easily made and easily mended. But her living was a rift, her very being a breach. Charlotte Pollard is a rip in the fabric of space/time, a breach with presence and physicality.\nROMANA: And it's through her we believe these distortions are flowing — a living conduit to a dimension which should never have met ours.\nVANSELL: Well, Doctor? Have you nothing to say?\nDOCTOR: (LOST TO HIMSELF) Charley ... oh, Charley. What have I done? I should have realised, should have seen it. (BEAT) Ramsay! Of course, he could sense it — as a Vortisaur, he wanted to feed from it. That's why he became so unmanageable...\nVANSELL: Doctor, please, do pay attention. Time is short. Time, in fact, is running out. The Matrix, as you know, is a vast repository housing the combined intelligences of all Time Lords, past and present living and dead. We have turned the entirety of the Matrix over to remembering all of history, as it should be recorded — so.\nMATRIX VOICES: (SCREAMING) Can't remember! I can't remember!\nMATRIX VOICES: [ETC]\nVANSELL: But as you can hear, the Matrix is cracking under the strain. And the Agency can no longer determine the true course of recorded time, well ... (TO ROMANA) I think, Madam President that the Doctor should see for himself.\nROMANA: If he must.\nVANSELL: The chamber in which you have been standing is not a cell, Doctor. It 1s, in fact, a portal into the Matrix — an Eighth Door, if you. will, over which you are currently positioned. There is a projected future, based on the likelihood of a continuing and incremental incursion of these Anti-Time phenomena into our universe. As ever, you will have an actual presence in the projection... but there's no substitute for being there, eh Doctor? Tell us what you see.\nDOCTOR: No — wait — I'm not readyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy —\nDOCTOR: 10. THE MATRIX (DARK GALLIFBEY)\nDOCTOR: (FX: UP CITY ATMOS. SPACESHIPS ROARING OVERHEAD. DISTANT EXPLOSIONS.

There has to be another way. And while my hearts are still beating, I swear to you I'll find it.\nROMANA: I know that, Doctor. Even if I was prepared to sanction the intervention necessary, to avoid the breach being opened in the first place, it'd be too late. This distortion, this disturbance, has grown too large to be controlled. (SLOWLY) But what if there was another way?\nDOCTOR: Then I'd take it.\nROMANA: It might be — dangerous. And the chances of success very slight.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know me, Romana — I like long odds.\nVANSELL: And you'd go along with anything, to put things right, so long as no harm came to Miss Pollard?\nDOCTOR: I think so, yes.\nROMANA: (FORMAL) Very well. Doctor, our only realistic approach is to follow the time distortion to its source —\nVANSELL: And destroy it. Lay waste to the scourge of Anti-Time at its root, before it lays waste to us. Always and forever.\nDOCTOR: You want to cross over into a dimension which may or may not even exist — and wipe it out?\nVANSELL: Oh, we have reason to believe the thinking is sound. There are — records, Doctor. Ancient records. But that's not important now. Will you join us? Will you help us?\nROMANA: (TO THE DOCTOR) Will you help me?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you know I will. (BEAT) But how? How in the name of Rassilon are you going to transport yourselves into this universe of Anti-T— (DRIES AS REALISATION STRIKES) Ah.\nVANSELL: Obvious, isn't it, Doctor? We'll be taking the same route as the time distortion. Through the space/time breach. Through Charlotte Elspeth Pollard.\nKURST: That's the Space/Time converter installed and operational. Though whether or not it's fully 18\nKURST: compatible with this antique — well, who can say?\nLEVITH: Then run through the data codes again, Kurst. We only have one chance to get this right, and I don't plan on being squashed to a singularity thanks to a faulty plug. (TO CHARLEY) Now, girl —\nCHARLEY: That's 'Charlotte’, thank you.\nLEVITH: ‘Charlotte’. (BEAT; THEN, SOFTER) Sorry. Tense. Pressure of work. This is the difficult bit. This device here is what we call a sub-proton accelerator — a special machine which, um... stimulates matter at the atomic level?\nCHARLEY: [ haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about, but it looks a bit like one of those things they have in hospitals now — you know, a Z-ray thing.\nLEVITH: An X-ray, you mean?\nCHARLEY: X-ray, Y-ray, Z-beam- what's the difference?\nLEVITH: Never mind. We're going to position these around you and soon — well, things will start to happen. You may feel yourself... changing.\nCHARLEY: Changing? Changing how?\nLEVITH: You're special, you see. Very special. There's more to you than meets the eye. Charlotte — I don't know how to tell you what you are. If I told you you were a unique cosmic phenomenon, a four- dimensional archway into a universe, anathema to our own, you wouldn't understand me, let alone believe it. Be still.\nCHARLEY: (STRUGGLING) What do you think you're — ow! (BEAT) If you see the Doctor afterwards, Levith — give him my love. If you'd understand that, of course.\nLEVITH: (TO KURST) Activate!\nCHARLEY: (GASPS IN PAIN) Uuuuuuh!\nDOCTOR: This is madness, Romana! If you're wrong —\nROMANA: Then the process should make no difference to Charley. It's an acceleration of matter — not all that different from a simple teleportation.\nVANSELL: And how many times in all of your famous exploits have you had your atoms split, broadcast and reassembled in the name of derring-do, Doctor — hm?\nDOCTOR: Lots, I suppose, but —\nROMANA: - but the point is, Doctor, you think we're right about her. You know what effect it's going to have on her. But it doesn't have to be for long — she'll restabilise once we're through, be her normal self again. And once we've discovered how to stem the flow of Anti- Time, there'll be no reason not to let she, and you, go. I'm sure that, under the circumstances, given your co-operation, Co-ordinator Vansell will be minded to turn a blind eye to an error in the CIA's — accounting.\nVANSELL: The Agency might be — persuaded, yes.\nDOCTOR: Romana, I wasn't sure about it at first, but I'm warming to your style of government.\nROMANA: I'll take that as a compliment, shall I? We're here.\nDOCTOR: Now that's what I call a Time Rotor.\nROMANA: Oh, Doctor. You don't keep a trans-temporal space/time station this size going with Meccano and a ball of string.\nDOCTOR: Foul slur! I replaced those parts properly, in the end. (BEAT) Hm. Don't have too many shipmates, do we? Just a skeleton crew — the Under-Cardinal there, and a cohort of guards. Keep the secret mission secret, hm? Wouldn't do to spread alarm.\nROMANA: Do be quiet and take a seat. Vansell — are your people prepared?\nROMANA: 19\nVANSELL: Confirming now. (FX: PUNCHING BUTTONS; INTO INTERCOM) Levith, Kurst — all is ready aboard the Doctor's TARDIS?\nLEVITH: (FUZZY, THROUGH INTERCOM) Running smoothly, Co-ordinator Vansell.\nDOCTOR: (TO VANSELL) I want to speak to Charley.\nVANSELL: Too late, Doctor. She's already in the acceleration field. (TO LEVITH, VIA INTERCOM ) That is correct, Levith?\nLEVITH: (VIA INTERCOM) Fully stabilised, now. Ready on your command.\nROMANA: (TO THE DOCTOR) As the breach is opened Vansell's people will download details of its precise space/time co-ordinates to us here in the console chamber. The Time Station will then dematerialise through those precise co-ordinates and — well, we'll see where we are when we get there.\nDOCTOR: If we get there.\nROMANA: Doctor, she will be alright.\nDOCTOR: She'd better be.\nROMANA: (ALOUD, ECHOING THROUGH SPEAKERS) Attention crew of Time Station! Prepare for full dematerialisation! (TO VANSELL) Vansell, give the order.\nVANSELL: (TO LEVITH, VIA INTERCOM) Calling Doctor's TARDIS. Begin sub-proton acceleration. (BEAT) Open the gateway!\nLEVITH: Confirmed. (BEAT) Ready, Kurst?\nKURST: Ready\nLEVITH: This is it. Begin full proton acceleration.\nCHARLEY: (SCREAMS) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nDOCTOR: You're hurting her! Stop it! Stop it now!\nVANSELL: (INTO INTERCOM) Levith! What's happening down there?\nLEVITH: (VIA INTERCOM, EXCITED) The girl — Charlotte. She's rippling, like a stone thrown into a pond, changing, expanding ... It's happening! It's — (FX: VIA INTERCOM, CHARLEY'S SCREAM TRANSMUTES INTO A HUGE, VIBRATING,\nWHIRLING: SOUND — TINGED WITH TWINKLING, ETHEREAL EFFECTS. BURST OF STATIC. INTERCOM GOES DEAD)\nDOCTOR: Charley!!!\nVANSELL: (INTO INTERCOM) Levith! Levith, are you there?\nDOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no!!!\nROMANA: Doctor, I — I'm sorry. I— (FX: BUZZ OF STATIC. INTERCOM BURSTS BACK INTO LIFE. THE WHIRLING IS GENTLER,\nMORE: EVEN)\nVANSELL: Quiet! Levith? Levith?\nLEVITH: (VIA INTERCOM, AWESTRUCK) It's just — fantastic. She's whirling, dancing with colour and... You can see the universe through her. You can see — everything —\nVANSELL: (SOFTLY, TO HIMSELF) 'And the gate of Zagreus opened before him/ And all of the Antiverse was revealed to him/ And its terrible beauty ached in his hearts...’\nROMANA: There, Doctor. There is another way. There is — hope. (ALOUD) Under-Cardinal! Commence dematerialisation. UNDER-CARDINAL: Yes, Madam President! 20\nROMANA: So the adventure begins.\nKURST: Amazing. Just amazing .. .\nLEVITH: Kurst! The console!\nKURST: Something's wrong — it's too much for this heap —\nKURST: (FX: AND THE ROARING GATEWAY BEGINS TO VIBRATE, CHARLEY'S SCREAMING FADING IN AND OUT OF THE EFFECT)\nLEVITH: The breach!

What — ANTI-CHARLEY: I'm not you, Charley. But I know everything about you. I know about when you were six, about that time in Burnham Beeches. Such a long, lazy, late afternoon in the woods, running and laughing with Nanny, your brothers. Then you ran on ahead, and you hid in the bracken, and you waited and waited — but they never came. And it got darker and darker, and you called out for help, but they still never came. And the shadows got longer, so you called and you whoopped and you shouted and cried. Then you ran, but you only went deeper and deeper into the woods — became more alone. And the shadows got longer and longer and longer, touching your heels. And you fell in a clearing, with no-one in sight. And you thought you were lost, that you'd never be found, and the shadows would reach you and take you away. (BEAT) Oh, Charley.

Let us feast on it.\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) What are they doing?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERED) Draining temporal energy from the rotor — from this ship. Fascinating! They're becoming less translucent, more solid!\nROMANA: (TO ANTI-CHARLEY) This Time Station is the property of the High Council of Gallifrey! I demand you... you people evacuate my craft!\nDOCTOR: Careful, Romana. No need to antagonise them...\nVANSELL: (ALOUD) That's quite enough. You guards — ready stasers and — FIRE!!!\nVANSELL: ANTI-CHARLEY: (LAUGHING) Oh, Vansell. Don't be so silly. (BEAT) The thing that you seek lies not far from here.\nVANSELL: What thing, Anti-creature? ANTI-CHARLEY: The truth you came in search of, you foolish man. The truth about Zagreus.\nVANSELL: (AGHAST) You know about Zagreus?\nDOCTOR: Everyone seems to, today. Interesting, that.\nROMANA: Quiet, Doctor! ANTI-CHARLEY: (TO VANSELL) There is a grotto in the hills not far away. There you will find the answers that you seek — and the object of your quest. (BEAT) Leave us to feed on your vessel — and go in search of the thing you came here for.\nVANSELL: (DECISIVE) Guards, lower your weapons and follow me.\nROMANA: Stop! (BEAT) You over-reach your authority, Vansell!\nVANSELL: And there is a higher authority than yours, Madam President! Guards!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERED) Romana, I have absolutely no idea what's going on here, but you can't possibly consider abandoning the Time Station to these creatures — it's our only way out of this place!\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) Firstly — if you could be bothered to keep up with the latest developments in our technology, you'd know that this ship has a limited ability to regenerate itself — given time. And secondly — we do still have your TARDIS, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERED) Wherever she is.\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) And we have to find your friend. My mind is made up. (ALOUD) Guards — form an escort. Co-ordinator Vansell and myself have a great and important mission to carry out.\nVANSELL: We do.\nROMANA: Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Romana, this is madness!\nDOCTOR: 30\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Go, Doctor. Go, all of you.\nDOCTOR: Well, whatever this great secret is, I only hope it's worth it.\nROMANA: Doctor, it will be. (ALOUD) Guards — follow me!\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 1: Can we not gorge ourselves on the Time Lords? All that temporal energy flowing through them...\nROMANA: ANTI-CHARLEY: Not yet, brother. They cannot escape us — not here, not now. First we feast on their machine — and once we're filled to bursting with their time, then we can consume them all.\nLEVITH: (PANTING) Slow down, Charley!\nCHARLEY: It's still in one piece! They might need help! (BEAT; THEN, EXULTANT) DOCTOR!!!\nDOCTOR: So come on, Romana. What exactly have we come here for?\nROMANA: The source of Anti-Time, Doctor. And we've found it.\nDOCTOR: I know that. But please, please — what else?\nCHARLEY: (SHOUTING, ABOUT 50 YARDS DISTANT) Doctor!!! Whoo-hoo! Over here! Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: Charley! Romana, it's Charley! Charley, I'm coming!\nVANSELL: (TO ROMANA, SARCASTIC) Such devotion to his companion. Oh, how touching. (BEAT) You know that if that 'Never- person' back there was correct — if the Books of Zagreus are proved to be true, and what we seek is indeed somewhere in this Anti-verse — then the Doctor will never approve.\nROMANA: The Doctor is full of surprises, Vansell. But his one abiding characteristic, whichever body he wears, whatever gibberish he speaks, however erratically he acts — is his unerring sense for what is right. I trust him, absolutely. And I always have.\nVANSELL: And if he pits himself against you? Against the Time Lords? Against the thing we almost daren't believe might be here? Who will you place your trust in then, Madam President?\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Oh Doctor — I was so afraid I'd never see you again!\nDOCTOR: You don't get rid of me that easily! (BEAT; INTIMATELY) I told you, Charley — whatever it takes. I won't ever let you down, I promise. (UP) Come on — you have to meet Romana! (BEAT) Romana, this is Charley, one of my best-ever friends. Charley, this is Romana, one of my best friends ever.\nCHARLEY: (SOURLY) Hello.\nROMANA: (AWKWARDLY) Hello.\nDOCTOR: (OBLIVIOUS, EXUBERANT) See — you're going to get along just famously! Now, who's this?\nCHARLEY: Oh, this is Levith. She... helped me, I suppose.\nLEVITH: Commander Levith. CIA.\nDOCTOR: Never mind.\nLEVITH: Co-ordinator ... Madam President. You should know — there are creatures here. We lost Kurst when we met them. They've vanished now, but they're dangerous —\nROMANA: Yes. The Never-people currently have control of the Time Station, Commander.\nDOCTOR: Not the best news, is it? (DISTRACTED, WALKING AWAY) Hmm. Those spikes. I wonder ...\nVANSELL: (URGENT) What about the local terrain, Levith? What have you seen?\nVANSELL: 31\nLEVITH: It's weird, Co-ordinator. There's a crevasse opened up — and then there's this forest — and the blowholes we passed on the way here —\nVANSELL: Blowholes?\nLEVITH: Entrances or something, in the ridges an foothills.\nVANSELL: Really.\nCHARLEY: So what do you make of this forest, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Mm. Interesting. These spikes — there's something about them. Nothing natural. It's almost like they've been manufactured, then beaten out of shape, twisted beyond recognition. Even the dust and the earth... this is metal ore, see?\nCHARLEY: Like iron filings?\nDOCTOR: That's it, exactly! (BEAT) Exactly...\nCHARLEY: Don't like the sound of that. (SUDDENLY) Yow!\nDOCTOR: What's wrong, Charl — ow!\nCHARLEY: Spots of rain.\nDOCTOR: Acid rain.\nCHARLEY: & DOCTOR: (TOGETHER) Run!!!\nROMANA: (SHOUTING FROM A FEW FEET AWAY) Doctor! Charley! We have to take cover! Over here!\nROMANA: (FX: RAIN GETS HARDER. MORE THUNDER. DOCTOR AND CHARLEY RUNNING OUT OF SCENE, 'OW'-ING AS THEY GO)\nROMANA: (DOCTOR AND CHARLEY RUNNING INTO TUNNEL; ROMANA, VANSELL, LEVITH AND\nGUARDS: ALREADY THERE)\nROMANA: Oh, do get a move on, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I know! I know! (STOPS) Whew. That stuff stings — and where I'm going to find a tailor to mend this jacket in the whole of Anti-Time, I don't know. (BEAT) You should get rid of that collar, Romana. It's hardly practical — and we're not standing on ceremony here.\nROMANA: Aren't we? (MOVES OFF)\nCHARLEY: (TO DOCTOR) Is your Madam Icy-Drawers always so frosty?\nDOCTOR: (SCANDALISED) What, Romana? No, not at all! But there's something here — something she's not telling me. Something big. Vansell's in on it, too — and that certainly bothers me. (BEAT) Tunnels.\nCHARLEY: Blowholes, Levith said.\nDOCTOR: No, too regular. Corridors, in fact. Leading left and right and straight ahead. (LOST IN THOUGHT) A network, forking off in all directions. There's light here, too. Dim light. Phosphorecence? No, no, no...\nCHARLEY: Is this a pattern, on the walls? See, like big ellipses? (BEAT) There's something it reminds me of, but I don't know what.\nDOCTOR: Hm. More filings. More rust. More decay. This is a very odd place we've landed up in, Charley.\nLEVITH: (DISTANT) Here! Over here!\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) Come on.\nDOCTOR: 32\nLEVITH: It's incredible!\nROMANA: Guards — spread out. (SCHOOLMISTRESSY) And don't touch anything. (TO VANSELL) Well, Vansell?\nVANSELL: This is it.\nROMANA: Possibly.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Come on, come on, let us through! (STOPS DEAD) Well, I'm impressed! It's vast — not so much a cavern, more a —\nROMANA: — achamber, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's it! A chamber! (MOVING FORWARD) And what's this at the heart of it, hm?\nCHARLEY: Doctor, this doesn't make sense. We've not come deep enough underground to be in a space like —- (AND SOMETHING DAWNING ON HER) Oh. Oh, Doctor, don't you see what this is?\nDOCTOR: (GRANDSTANDING, MOVING AROUND) Yes, Charley, I think I do! Metal spikes, piercing the earth all around us, twisted and blasted, encrusted with rust and decay... Tunnels, corridors leading to a huge chambers and vaults, perhaps some even bigger than this... Everywhere, pitted circles in the walls... And now here, at the core of the thing, a massive stalactite, connecting a fluted ceiling to a broad, hexagonal dais... We're not on an asteroid, some natural satellite.\nDOCTOR: This entire planetoid — this blasted lump of flotsam, spinning in the chaos of Anti-Time, this coal fallen from infinity's grate — the only fixed point in the whole of this swirling Anti-verse... it doesn't belong here. It came from outside the bounds of the maelstrom, from — from...\nROMANA: Our world, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Our world, exactly.\nCHARLEY: (SLOWLY) We've not come deep enough underground to be in a space like this because... because it's bigger on the inside than —\nDOCTOR: — bigger on the inside than the out! No stalactite, then. A console. (BEAT) This whole world... the shattered hulk of a fabulous machine, its dimensions ripped asunder, turned inside out, compacted, mapped onto itself... (LOUD, ALMOST EXULTANT) This — is the wreck — of a TARDIS!\nCHARLEY: I don't believe this.\nDOCTOR: Romana, Vansell — you knew, didn't you? You've known all along. (SADLY) Oh, Romana.\nROMANA: The possibility was accounted for. I'm sorry, Doctor — I didn't quite dare believe it myself.\nVANSELL: You see, Doctor — the question is not that this place is the remnant of an abandoned TARDIS. The question is not even how it came to be here. No, the question is - who brought it here? Whose TARDIS was this? (BEAT) Madam President — if you would permit me the honour?\nROMANA: The stage is yours.\nVANSELL: Guards. The neutron staff — quick. Now, Doctor — let's see if we can shed a little light on the mystery. Out of the way of the console! (FX: SCRAPING OF METAL) The power receptors are still intact. Opening flux valves — now. (FX: SPARKS. BLIPS AND BLEEPS. SHAKING. STEADY THRUM OF BUILDING POWER,\nEVOLVING: INTO MAJESTIC TARDIS ATMOS)\nDOCTOR: Amazing — I never imagined —\nVANSELL: Just a spark of life, Doctor. One spark... will be... enough!!!\nCHARLEY: (STARTLED) Aah! Above the console- there's something forming... A face — in the air!\nDOCTOR: We call it a hologram, Charley. (BEAT) And I know that face. I saw it in the Matrix... An old man, eternally sad and infinitely wise ... (SUBDUED, ALMOST HORRIFIED) It can't be.\nVANSELL: (QUOTING) 'There to do battle with Zagreus, the Beast/Never resting as long as history is lasting/Until either or both are laid to waste...’\nCHARLEY: It's going to speak!\nROMANA: On your knees, Doctor — Miss Pollard. On your knees, all of you! (AND THE HOLOGRAM SPEAKS — SLIGHTLY DISTORTING, SHAKING, BUT STILL FILLING\nROMANA: 33\nROMANA: THE AIR WITH DEPTH AND RICHNESS...

I resolved to journey into the strange, uncharted fringes of space/time in search of my nemesis — and here, in this weird unreality, I found the neverworld of Zagreus, the corpus of chaos and no-when.

Now, Doctor — let's see if we can shed a little light on the mystery. Out of the way of the console! (FX: SCRAPING OF METAL) The power receptors are still intact. Opening flux valves — now.\nVANSELL: (FX: SPARKS. BLIPS AND BLEEPS. SHAKING. STEADY THRUM OF BUILDING POWER,\nEVOLVING: INTO MAJESTIC TARDIS ATMOS)\nDOCTOR: Amazing — I never imagined —\nVANSELL: Just a spark of life, Doctor. One spark... will be... enough!!!\nCHARLEY: (STARTLED) Aah! Above the console- there's something forming... A face — in the air!\nDOCTOR: We call it a hologram, Charley. (BEAT) And I know that face. I saw it in the Matrix... An old man, eternally sad and infinitely wise ... (SUBDUED, ALMOST HORRIFIED) It can't be.\nVANSELL: (QUOTING) 'There to do battle with Zagreus, the Beast/Never resting as long as history is lasting/Until either or both are laid to waste...’\nCHARLEY: It's going to speak!\nROMANA: On your knees, Doctor — Miss Pollard. On your knees, all of you!\nROMANA: (AND THE HOLOGRAM SPEAKS — SLIGHTLY DISTORTING, SHAKING, BUT STILL FILLING THE AIR WITH DEPTH AND RICHNESS... SOMETHING LIKE THE VOICE OF GOD)\nOLD MAN: It has been a time beyond measuring — here, alone in the cold, adrift and aloof from my people, my home. Once, my name was hailed and feared in equal measure by friends and enemies alike. Know, then, that I am Conqueror of Yssgaroth, Overpriest of Drornid, First Earl of Prydon, Patris of the Vortex, Ravager of the Void... and President of Gallifrey from the time of our empire's Great Foundation. I am the Lord Rassilon. At last, my children, you have returned to me.\nDOCTOR: (TO ROMANA) I don't understand. Rassilon died on Gallifrey millions of years ago. Romana, I've been inside his tomb!\nROMANA: Quiet, Doctor! There's more of the simulacrum!\nOLD MAN: (CONTINUING) A long time past, I helped end centuries of tyranny and bloodshed on my home planet, helped to usher in a great age of enlightenment. With faithful counsel from the wisest of my technomagi, I locked the space/time continuum with the great Eye of Harmony. But, in my declining years, I grew fearful that by constructing the one true Time, I might have brought into being its very opposite. The menace of what I termed Anti-Time — a vile poison which might yet spill out to contaminate and undo all I have sought to achieve — filled me with horror and dread. I resolved to journey into the strange, uncharted fringes of space/time in search of my nemesis — and here, in this weird unreality, I found the neverworld of Zagreus, the corpus of chaos and no-when. I have battled this entity; it is dormant, docile now. My TARDIS shattered, my exit point shut, I am trapped in this place. But I leave this message in the hope that one day, my Time Lords will find a way to rescue me. My body, I have placed in a Zero Cabinet nearby, my life's breath suspended; if I live, my children, I should like you to revive me, and take me to Gallifrey... take me home.\nCHARLEY: So... I take it that was someone important?\nDOCTOR: That's putting it mildly, Charley. (BEAT; TO HIMSELF) This is all wrong...\nROMANA: (TO EVERYONE) You may stand. Well, Doctor. Now you know.\nDOCTOR: Congratulations, Romana. You've discovered Rassilon. What do you call someone so powerful they rescue God?\nDOCTOR: 35\nROMANA: There are no gods, Doctor — Rassilon least of all. Oh, we've given him the trappings of a\nROMANA: god — sacred relics and recitals, myths of his achievements and creations. We even call him Father to\nROMANA: our race. But he was just a man. A great and wise man — but a man, all the same. For millions of years,\nROMANA: we've been busy venerating his name, garlanding him in glory — but how much do we actually know\nROMANA: about him?\nDOCTOR: Biographical information is thin on the ground, I'll admit, but —\nVANSELL: So the great Doctor turns sceptic. Now I've heard it all!\nDOCTOR: That's not the point, Vansell. We are in an environment we know next-to-nothing about —\nDOCTOR: just conjecture and guesswork. There are ghost-like creatures back there — which we really don't know\nDOCTOR: anything about — draining the Time Station dry. And now we find that the greatest of our heroes is not\nDOCTOR: actually resting in peace in the Death Zone, but actually transported himself here I-don't-know-how in\nDOCTOR: search of an I-don't-know-what called \"Zagreus'? (BEAT) Whew. Hasn't it been a long day?\nCHARLEY: I think I understand who Rassilon was. But how did this lot know to find him here? And\nCHARLEY: wasn't 'Zagreus' a character in a children's rhyme, or something? That's right — it came up in Singapore,\nCHARLEY: remember?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. 'Zagreus sits inside your head/Zagreus lives among the dead...\nVANSELL: ...'Zagreus sees you in your bed/ And eats you when you're sleeping.’ Miss Pollard asks\nVANSELL: good questions, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It's a nursery rhyme, Vansell — tea-time terror for Time Tots! It doesn't mean anything —\nDOCTOR: does it?\nCHARLEY: 'Ring-a-ring-a-roses.'\nDOCTOR: What?\nCHARLEY: Oh, Doctor — you know. 'Ring-a-ring-a-roses/ A poket full of posies/A-tish-oo/A-tish-\nCHARLEY: 00/We all fall down.’ (BEAT) It's about the Black Death, isn't it? Sneezing was a symptom of bubonic\nCHARLEY: plague, and ‘all fall down' means — well, dying.\nDOCTOR: Charley, you're right! So how does the second verse go? Think, think! 'Zagreus at the end\nDOCTOR: of days/Zagreus...' (BEAT) No, it's gone.\nVANSELL: Then let me refresh your straining memory, Doctor. 'Zagreus at the end of days/Zagreus\nVANSELL: lies all other ways/Zagreus comes when time's a maze...'\nDOCTOR: ...'And all of history's weeping.’ Yes, of course! It could almost be a metaphor —\nVANSELL: —for what's happening to the Web of Time, yes. Intriguing, then, that 'Zagreus' should\nVANSELL: figure in the literature of other worlds — as a parable on Sparbarus and Finniam 4; as an epic of the\nVANSELL: Jxrxkrk-speaking peoples...\nDOCTOR: Well, don't quote that. The consonants alone could keep us here for weeks.\nVANSELL: (JGNORING HIM) ... and can be found in the Black Library of an Earth sect, the Knights\nVANSELL: of St John the Beheaded. Commander Levith here borrowed this 'Book of Zagreus' in Earth's twentieth\nVANSELL: century — but it is known to have existed as far back as the twelfth epoch, and possibly beyond.\nVANSELL: Levith?\nLEVITH: Co-ordinator. (BEAT; CONTINUES STORY) The book tells of a great hero, an alchemist\nLEVITH: and warrior who has struck a deal with the Gods to establish a marvellous empire in the heavens; his\nLEVITH: people are contented and happy, living in an enlightened, benevolent Utopia. But at night, this hero\nLEVITH: dreams of a terrible being who will rise to overthrow his people; his mirror-opposite, who will exact as\nLEVITH: awful a disestablishment of the hero's empire as its building was miraculous.\nVANSELL: (QUOTING) 'Zagreus waits at the end of the world/For Zagreus is the end of the\nVANSELL: world/His time is the end of time/ And his moment Time's undoing.' Again, the parallel to the Web is\nVANSELL: quite remarkable.\nCHARLEY: So what happens, to the hero?\nVANSELL: He abandons his people. He builds a vast and mighty cosmic ship and goes in search of\nVANSELL: the land of Zagreus, a land he knows only to exist in dreams. (QUOTING) 'He set then his course/To a\nVANSELL: soar on the face of Creation/Where the stars lived and died in the churn of one night/And decay was\nVANSELL: the only true constant.'\nLEVITH: After many, many years, he is ready to give up his quest — when he imagines a huge gate in 36\nLEVITH: the clouds: (QUOTING) ‘And the gate of Zagreus opened before him/And all of the Anti-verse was revealed to him/And its terrible beauty ached in his hearts.'\nDOCTOR: (INTRIGUED) Hearts plural? Really?\nVANSELL: (CONTINUING)'So through them he ventured/There to do battle with Zagreus, the Beast/Never resting as long as history is lasting/Until either or both are laid to waste.'\nDOCTOR: ... and they all lived happily ever after, I suppose? I accept, there are a few circumstantial connections to be made, but the evidence is hardly compelling. So what else?\nROMANA: The name of the hero, Doctor, is 'Azalon' or sometimes 'Razlon'; in some traditions, simply 'Ra’. These folktales share one other element: before the hero leaves home in search of Zagreus, he orders all records of his quest destroyed, for fear of undermining his Utopia. His people believe him passed away.\nDOCTOR: And you believed it. All of it.\nVANSELL: It explained why the idea of Anti-Time has always b un discredited or suppressed — an enduring legacy of Rassilon's lieutenants — but a possible congruence between these tales and the heresy of Anti-Time has been noted for centuries.\nROMANA: Only recently have our students been brave enough to break with the Great Curriculum, to open their eyes to newer fields — sharing their knowledge with other of the Temporal Powers.\nVANSELL: — An undertaking which my Agency has been happy to assist. But imagine if the great Rassilon were to be returned to us — he who began the Intuitive Revelation, who established the Eye of Harmony and anchored the space/time vortex. How much could we achieve? How much further could the Time Lords go?\nDOCTOR: Well, you'll forgive me for stating the blindingly obvious, Vansell, but the question is entirely academic for the moment.\nCHARLEY: Why's that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Where is he, Charley? Where's Rassilon? Where's the body?\nDOCTOR: ANTI-VOICE 1: The Time Lords are all gathered together, sister, in the cavern. Can we not absorb them now — now, while their saga is stalled and their histories ripe for consumption? ANTI-CHARLEY: Stay your appetite, brother. Will we squander an eternal banquet for the sake of a moment's hunger? Satisfaction will be ours. There is a phrase, known by the Earth girl — ‘just desserts’. The Time Lords will be our just desserts — not only now, but forever.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) They procrastinate. It's time we intervened.\nDOCTOR: — but you're not listening to me, any of you! Our mythologies are not so widespread to have permeated the cultures of so many other worlds —\nROMANA: The legend of the Vampires did. There, Rassilon is cast in many guises: on Xerxes, as He- With-the-Bolts-of-Truth; on Earth, as Shandor, and Van ... something, too.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, there is that.\nVANSELL: In the Outer Wastes, the curse of the Pythia is recounted in the saga of their She- Serpent...\nLEVITH: In the witch-lore of Casseiopeia, she is known as the Countess Bathori, or Baphmet.\nROMANA: So why not? Why should the tale of Rassilon's true fate not have escaped Gallifrey — especially if it were proscribed?\nCHARLEY: Romana does have a point, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know — it's just that I'm certain something's wrong, and I don't know quite what...\nLEVITH: Why are we debating this?\nLEVITH: 37\nVANSELL: Indeed. (TO ROMANA) Madam President, the proof lies inside a Zero Cabinet,\nVANSELL: somewhere within the bounds of this planet — or TARDIS, whatever.\nROMANA: Agreed. (TO ALL) We search, methodically — and find Rassilon's casket.\nDOCTOR: If it exists.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Oh, Doctor. Of course the casket exists.\nDOCTOR: You again! Have you been listening in?\nCHARLEY: (TO DOCTOR) Doctor! Have you met that, that — thing with my face already?\nDOCTOR: (TO CHARLEY) Oh yes. And I know enough to be wary of it.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Well, Co-ordinator? Have you found what you came here for?\nANSELL: Only in part. Do you know where the casket is, Never- person?\nANSELL: NTI-CHARLEY: We do.\nOCTOR: I don't like the way this conversation is going...\nOCTOR: NTI-CHARLEY: We hold the casket. We wish to make an accommodation with you, for its return.\nOMANA: I'm sorry? Am I to take it you want to negotiate terms?\nOMANA: NTI-CHARLEY: We know you, Time Lords. We know the effect that our limited excursions into\nOMANA: your reality has had upon your continuity. We know, if you could, you would eliminate us utterly. But\nOMANA: your time gives us being. Would you deny us our right to exist?\nDOCTOR: A very fair point. Romana?\nROMANA: Doctor, I can't. What their very existence might do to the Web of Time —it's incalculable!\nROMANA: You saw the Matrix projection.\nDOCTOR: But who's to say that's not one of a billion alternatives? You — I mean, we — we Time\nDOCTOR: Lords are a pretty conservative bunch; the minds in the Matrix even more so. The slightest tremor in\nDOCTOR: their web sets their senses jangling. Of course the Matrix is in turmoil!\nVANSELL: As much as the sentiment sticks in my throat, Madam President, the Doctor is right. The\nVANSELL: least we can do is hear their terms.\nROMANA: I will not be rushed, Vansell!\nVANSELL: And I will not stand by while our greatest hero languishes at the mercy of these creatures,\nVANSELL: while our very reality is imperilled! (COLD, DELIBERATE) Sometimes, Madam President, I don't\nVANSELL: think you've the hearts for this job.\nROMANA: Is this insurrection, Co-ordinator? Take care. Take great care!\nDOCTOR: Calm down, both of you.\nVANSELL: (BURSTING WITH ANGER) I will not be calm! We have held ourselves back too long,\nVANSELL: bound by caution, tradition and deference. We are a joke! We maintain the universe, oh yes — we\nVANSELL: preserve it in amber, its injustices uncorrected. Aggressors go unpunished in the name of mediation.\nVANSELL: Doctor, you placed the Daleks — the Daleks, the most evil, ruthless, coldly calculating race to have\nVANSELL: ever stained our history! — in a time loop. We could crush them, now, ensure that the torments they\nVANSELL: visit upon every peoples they encounter never occur again! But will we? Will we? We could work with\nVANSELL: our allies — the Monan Host, the Warpsmiths of Phaidon, humanity even — to build a consensus for\nVANSELL: progress across all the galaxies, to be a radical force for the advancement of a common good!\nROMANA: Have you quite finished?\nVANSELL: I haven't begun! So come on, Madam President. The Daleks. What will you do? Will you\nVANSELL: let them go eventually? Will you? Of course you will. You don't have the imagination for anything\nVANSELL: else!\nROMANA: This Is hardly the time or the place for such a debate.\nVANSELL: Why not? Do we have to argue whether or not we should negotiate the return of the\nVANSELL: architect of our race — a progressive, a hero who was unafraid to reach out to the unknown to further\nVANSELL: not just the glory of his people, but the security of the people of the entire universe! Our reality is\nVANSELL: falling apart, and yet you vacillate while the one man who might have the wisdom and power to\nVANSELL: resolve this crisis is within your reach!\nDOCTOR: Good speech, Vansell — a postcard from Planet Nosebung. A nice place to visit, but you 38\nDOCTOR: <\nDOCTOR: rASroS\nDOCTOR: wouldn't want to live there.\nVANSELL: I'll not take criticism from a deposed President a convicted criminal — a feckless joyrider whose misplaced sentimentality caused the Anti-Time breach in the first place! You should have paid dear for your countless offences by now. A strong leader would have ensured it!\nVANSELL: ANTI-CHARLEY: (BOOMING) Enough! These are our terms. We will return to you the casket containing your hero, the great Rassilon, whose thoughts and deeds have passed into legend. We will also return to you your Time Station. In exchange we require only that you undertake to establish a dialogue between the peoples of our realities. We hope to abide by the laws of your universe, in exchange for limited freedom to trawl your time stream for the energies which give us meaning. We anticipate, therefore, the construction of a permanent gateway between our realities...\nDOCTOR: What, using Charley as your back door? That's not on!\nCHARLEY: Definitely not! (ALMOST EMBARRASSED) Well don't I have a say in the matter? ANTI- HARLEY: (CONTINUING, UNAFFECTED) ... and so, as a show of good faith, we desire to retain one of your three leaders — the Madam President, the Co-ordinator, or the Doctor — who shall remain here in our universe, until such an accord can be reached.\nDOCTOR: Yes yes yes, but what about Charley?\nVANSELL: \"What about Charley?\" What about her? The time she has now is stolen — pilfered on her behalf by you, Doctor.\nROMANA: That is a very unkind reading of Miss Pollard's predicament —\nVANSELL: (CUTTING IN) — but an accurate one! (BEAT) There is every reason to suppose that Rassilon himself may yet find a solution to this conundrum. After all, we don't yet know how he entered this Antiverse m the first place. (BEAT; TO ANTI-CHARLEY) We accept your terms, Never- person.\nVANSELL: ANTI-CHARLEY: You volunteer yourself to remain behind Co-ordinator?\nVANSELL: I do not. I nominate the Lady Romanadvoratrelundar, President of Gallifrey and all its dominions. One president — for our first President. A fair exchange. Levith — escort the Lady Romana.\nLEVITH: With pleasure, Co-ordinator.\nROMANA: I would have stayed behind all the same, Vansell. My choice will not be made at staser- point.\nDOCTOR: So this is what you wanted, Vansell. Staff a Time Station with your CIA placemen, take your President into another universe and pull off a bloodless coup, returning in glory as Rassilon's right-hand man — and chosen heir, perhaps? (TO ANTI-CHARLEY) Do not take this man at his word, Never-person. He is more interested in his own political gain than the well-being of your people! ANTI-CHARLEY: I do not agree, Doctor. We have been observing the Co-ordinator. He is a principled and honest man, who believes in his oath of office. We trust him. (BEAT) The casket awaits you on the plain outside. You will all join me there.\nROMANA: I'm disappointed in you, Vansell. I judged you loyal.\nVANSELL: Oh I am. To my planet. To my people. To Rassilon. But to you, my lady? I don't think so.\nCHARLEY: Well, I think turncoats like you get what they deserve!\nVANSELL: Levith, keep these three covered. And if Miss Pollard so much as squeaks again — be sure to kill the Doctor. (BEAT) Now, we have just arranged a meeting, let's go. Come on, then — move!\nVANSELL: (SHOUTING INTO THE AIR) We are here, Never-people. Where are you? (FX:\nTWINKLING: COSMIC EFFECTS. ANTI-TIME MUSIC) What — just you again? Where is the casket? ANTI-CHARLEY: Patience, Co-ordinator. (BEAT)\nTWINKLING: 39\nCHARLEY: Doctor, is she communicating with the others — you know, with telepathy or something?\nDOCTOR: Possibly, Charley, very possibly. (WHISPERED, TO ROMANA) Romana, whatever happens, don't give up. Keep the faith. There's a way out of all this — I know there is!\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) Doctor, one day you'll fail to keep one of your promises. It'll come as a terrible shock to you when it happens.\nVANSELL: Stop gossiping, you two. We're waiting.\nROMANA: I'm ready. (TO ANTI-CHARLEY) What do you want with me, Never-person? ANTI-CHARLEY: You will cross to my position. The remainder will stay back.\nROMANA: Very well. (BEAT/ FX: TEN FOOTSTEPS' SPACE) Will this do? ANTI-CHARLEY: That will suffice.\nROMANA: (SPONTANEOUSLY, ALOUD) You know, you're wrong, Vansell. We Time Lords have a duty to all the people of the Universe, yes. But the Utopia you imagine is an anodyne and pointless paradise. How many things do you want us to set right? Do we intervene to ensure that no-one dies young? Do we change the course of history when someone's heart is broken? Do we remove all predators from the timeline, rewrite the rules of natural selection? The Universe can be a cruel and savage place-but a wild garden can be beautiful. You'd concrete the galaxy if you pricked your thumb on a rose. We guard the inevitability of events. Sometimes, the hardest thing is not to act; the hardest thing is to watch, and learn.

(BEAT) I've never been inside this universe before — well, no-one has. NTI-CHARLEY: (MOCKING?) — except for your hero Lord Rassilon, of course.\nROMANA: Of course. But he didn't send me a postcard.\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 2: Oh, no, no, no! You really don't remember me, Romana? Oh, they said you'd grown cold and heartless — but I didn't believe them. And now I know it's true. (SHE BEGINS TO SOB)\nROMANA: Well, I'm sorry. I'm usually good with faces, but yours — ANTI-CHARLEY: Then let us put names to the faces. The girl's name is Laris; the boy is her brother, Korvan.\nROMANA: No. Those names mean nothing to me. ANTI-VOICE 2: (WAILS PLAINTIVELY) She doesn't remember, Korvan!\nROMANA: 42\nFASS: AFOSAR\nFASS: ANTI-VOICE 1: How could you be so beastly?\nROMANA: Oh, come on! This is getting ridiculous!\nROMANA: ANTI-CHARLEY: When you were a little girl, Lady Romana, no more than sixty years or so, your family would spend most summers in a rambling house on the shores of Lake Abydos. You used to go swimming with the singing fish; you collected zinc hawthorns from the molten rushes near the water's edge.\nROMANA: I did — yes. But how do you know — ? And just what has any of this got to do with you lot, anyway?\nROMANA: ANTI-CHARLEY: Quiet! (BEAT) Did you go alone, Lady Romana?\nROMANA: (WITH HER LAST RESERVES OF PATIENCE) Yes. I was an only child. I didn't have many friends. I was usually too worried about my tribiphysics marks.\nROMANA: NTI-CHARLEY: Oh, but you did have friends, my lady.\nROMANA: NTI-VOICE 2: You had us!\nOMANA: Well, now you're just being silly. I know my own memories.\nOMANA: NTI-VOICE 1: Then you'll remember the day we found the flurry-birds nesting in the old pavilion . the time the hermit at the far side of the Ravos-burn chased us away with fire-sigils? NTI-VOICE 2: Oh, say you do, Romana — please?\nOMANA: No... no I do not... how can I?\nOMANA: NTI-VOICE 2: But... but we were your friends. For years...\nOMANA: NTI-CHARLEY: Enough, Laris. Don't hurt yourself any more. (BEAT) Tell me, my lady — with your investiture into the highest office, were you not made privy to all of Gallifrey's most closely- guarded secrets?\nROMANA: Well, obviously.\nROMANA: NTI-CHARLEY: The Jaskud Records? The War Perceptors? The Cavux Imperatives?\nOMANA: Yes, yes, yes ...\nOMANA: TI-CHARLEY: — plus, of course, the Oubliette of Eternity.\nMANA: (CAGEY) Yes.\nMANA: TI-CHARLEY: What is the Oubliette of Eternity, Madam President?\nMANA: A disused chamber, deep in the heart of our largest off — world station — NTI-CHARLEY: The headquarters of the Celestial Intervention Agency. Could you tell me, Madam President, what this chamber was used for?\nROMANA: Dispersal — a barbaric punishment, long since abolished. Is this relevant? ANTI-CHARLEY: Very. And what exactly did 'dispersal' entail?\nROMANA: It was reserved for those found guilty only of the highest treason against Gallifrey. Inside the chamber, offenders would be dissipated from history — their entire timeline erased, as if they had never... (REALISATION DAWNING)... existed.\nROMANA: ANTI-CHARLEY: And where, do you suppose, did these dispersed people go?\nROMANA: Nowhere... I mean, they'd never existed! There was nowhere for them to go!\nDOCTOR: (LOUD) Oh, but there was, Romana. Here! — They came here! (TO HIMSELF) It all makes sense, don't you see? A barren subdimension beyond the planes of our reality where the usual rules don't apply!\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Doctor! How good it is to see you! (TO ANTI-PEOPLE) Bring him here.\nDOCTOR: It's alright, I'm coming, I'm coming. I've got no reason to hide.\nROMANA: (UNPERTURBED) You mean... all of you... all these thousands of you... once, you were Gallifreyans? Time-Lords even?\nROMANA: ANTI-CHARLEY: Banished from existence at the behest of the CIA. (BEAT) Biddulf here was a Chancellery Guard who got drunk on Malian Head Juice and babbled details of President Pandak's retinue. Savos beside him was the barman whose only crime was to listen to Biddulf's slurred nonsense. Both were dispersed here, their lives deleted and forgotten. Korvan and Laris were caught\nROMANA: 43\nROMANA: PrrAr: PRES\nROMANA: rFArASr RS\nOZOZ: accessing classified documents in a bid to discover how they where orphaned; they discovered that their parents, Majos and Tesla, were student rebels, dispersed for unlicensed and unsponsored researches into mutagenic breeding. Everyone here has a story to tell.\nOZOZ: ANTI-VOICE I: And you forgot all about us. If we'd never existed, what was there to remember? But we remember. We remember you, Romana.\nDOCTOR: Can I ask a question? You-the one with Charley's form. Who are you? Where did you come from?\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: I wear the shape of the space-time breach as a badge, a symbol of our means of escape. On Gallifrey, my name was Sentris.\nDOCTOR: And what was your crime? What did you do?\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: My offences were many and terrible, Doctor. I was a cold killer, a ruthless murderer of innocents.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, but by the sounds of it you, at least, got something of what you deserved. ANTI-CHARLEY: Oh, I was never sentenced — or caught, even. I sent myself to the Oubliette of Infinity, dispersed myself into this screaming tumult. I was the two-hundred-and-seventeenth Co- ordinator of the CIA (BEAT) It seemed very rare, to authorise a dispersal. But when you cannot remember that the last person you had destroyed was ever alive at all — you go along with it. One day, I checked the records we kept in a time-protected vault. In just one year as the head of the Agency I found that I had approved the non-execution of over two hundred non-people. The shame was too much to bear. I destroyed myself. And came here, to find myself surrounded by my victims. They have despised me for an eternity, but I have promised to make amends — to give them their lives back. This I shall do.\nROMANA: (OVER THIS AS THEY GET FRACTIONALLY LOUDER) On behalf of the High Council of Time Lords, I tell you that I am desperately sorry for what has happened to you: to you, Biddulf and Saves; to you, Korvan and Laris; to all of you. And you, Sentris, I pity you, and, I hope one day you find peace. This was a terrible chapter in Gallifrey’s history, and if there is some way to give you something back, then —\nROMANA: ANTY-CHARLEY: (CUTTER SILENCE BEHIND THIS) 'Was'! This 'was' a terrible chapter in Gallifrey's history? I pity you, Time Lady — I pity the act that our ranks swell by the day, that the number of us continues to grow — by the men who carry out their actions in your name, Madam President, in your sacred name!\nDOCTOR: Are you saying that — that these '‘dispersals' continue? Now?\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Yes, Doctor. Yes, I am!\nROMANA: (TO HERSELF, WITH UTTER FURY) Vansell!\nVANSELL: (NEXT TO CRACKLING CASKET, A BIT DISTANT) Is the Time Rotor fully charged, Under-Cardinal? UNDER-CARDINAL: Temporal reactors fully fuelled Acting President — sir!\nVANSELL: Good, good... (MURMURING TO CASKET) Great Lord Rassilon. I am but your humblest servant. I live to carry out your every instruction. (BEAT) (FX: CRACKLING 'RIPPLES' ) What? What's that? Yes, yes — of course . ..\nLEVITH: Don't fight the straps, Charley. Only one more transformation.\nCHARLEY: (STRUGGLING) So you say. Levith, we can't just abandon Romana — or the Doctor, if he's still alive. What you're doing is treason!\nLEVITH: I'm carrying out my Acting President's instructions. And for what it’s worth, I happen to think that what he's doing is right. Oh you wouldn't understand.\nLEVITH: 44\nCHARLEY: I understand that your Acting President has flipped his lid! He's talking to the casket\nCHARLEY: now!\nVANSELL: (DISTANT) Is everything alright, Levith?\nLEVITH: Nearly ready, sir!\nVANSELL: Excellent. (FX: A SLIGHT CRACKLING EFFECT ON HIS VOICE, BREAIUNG HIS WORDS. ANTI-TIME MUSIC) Dematerialisation in thirteen microspans!\nCHARLEY: Anti-Time! Did you hear that, Levith — did you? (BEAT) Vansell's been infected with Anti-Time!\nCHARLEY: ANTI-CHARLEY: Korvan, Laris — you may leave now. You know what you have to do. ANTI-VOICE 1:Yes, Sentris. ANTI-VOICE 2: Goodbye, Romana. We miss you.\nROMANA: Goodbye — and I'm sorr — (BEAT) They've gone.\nDOCTOR: Hm. So tell me, Sentris — is there no way back to Gallifrey, back through this Oubliette? ANTI-CHARLEY: It isn't a doorway, Doctor — just a crude, cruel device. But when you opened the breach, when you saved your friend Charley — oh, to swim in real time, Doctor! To exist! To be! That small, simple right — denied us by you, and all who follow Rassilon!\nROMANA: Rassilon? What do you have against Rassilon? ANTI-CHARLEY: Rassilon! Ha! That paranoid despot, the architect of the Web of Time? The worm who denied free will to the people of the Universe, chained them to his Eye, bound them to one single reality? Who decreed that any threat to his great empire's sanctity should be dispersed from all time?\nROMANA: (INCREDULOUS) What, Rassilon built the Oubliette? Then that means —\nDOCTOR: Oh yes! Rassilon created Anti-Time!\nROMANA: (JNSPIRED) And he called it 'Zagreus'! He realised what he'd done, and transported himself here, to — to ... No, no. That can't be right, can it?\nDOCTOR: No, it can't. Oh, Romana — don't you see? There's no such thing as 'Zagreus'! There never was!\nROMANA: No such th — (BEAT; TO ANTI-CHARLEY, ANGRY) Is this true? ANTI-CHARLEY: Ah, the legend of Zagreus! What a fabulous invention, a marvellous conceit — whispered in the ears of the gullible on a hundred worlds, in a thousand different eras. An enticement — and you, Madam President, have been well and truly snared.\nDOCTOR: See? I knew it was too good to be true. Let's think now: Gallifrey has been sealed off, ever since the time distortions began to warp the weft of reality — yes?\nROMANA: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: So how to persuade its masters to take a trip into Anti-Time? Why not invent a legend, a myth which no Time Lord could possibly ignore? The survival of Rassilon, say. All very clever —a story just obscure enough to be plausible, a murmur given to chroniclers on twelfth century Earth, on Xerxes, on Sparbarus and so many others; a folktale which we, ourselves, might have forgotten. And it spread, throughout the ages, being repeated, becoming distorted until finally it gets brought to Gallifrey as a children's nursery rhyme. Then everything is set for one small, judicious intervention, perhaps, to nudge the tale beneath the noses of the CIA. And what a temptation that would have been — the possibility that Rassilon himself might be alive. Of course Vansell swallowed it — baited, hooked and reeled in. (TO ANTI-PEOPLE) Am I[ right, or am I right, Sentris? ANTI-CHARLEY: Close enough, Doctor.\nROMANA: But to what end? Why?\nDOCTOR: Well, surely that's obvious. If the legend of Zagreus is a myth, then Rassilon still sleeps the sleep of the just in his Dark Tower, back in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.\nROMANA: So who was that man we saw, in the hologram? ANTI-CHARLEY: A trick of the light? A mere phantasm? (FX: HER VOICE BEGINS TO WARP\nROMANA: 45\nROMANA: AND DISTORT, BECOMING THAT OF THE OLD MAN IN Sc. 33) Or simply a projection of the thing you most desired —\nOLD MAN: (ANTI-CHARLEY) (MOCKING, COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED) — a man with the wisdom of all the ages.

I suppose the wrecked TARDIS was a false construction, too?\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: (WARPED BACK — A LINGER OF THE OLD MAN ON HER FIRST FEW WORDS) Oh, my people include several TARDIS engineers — dissolved from history for sharing secrets with alien mechanics, or striving to over-ride Rassilon's Great Protocols. This whole world was fashioned from the debris of unlicenced time vessels, blasted out of continuity by your agents.\nDOCTOR: Hm. All of which begs one final question ...\nROMANA: If that's not Rassilon in the casket ...\nDOCTOR: ... what does it contain?\nDOCTOR: (FX : ENGINES BUILDING IN PITCH.

Of course. (ALOUD, TO CREW) There's no need for alarm. Everything's going according to plan.\nCHARLEY: No...\nDOCTOR: What are you planning, Sentris - you and your people? ANTI-CHARLEY: Anti-Time cannot pass the transduction barriers which separate Gallifrey's continuity from the remainder of space-time. Your temporal locks are too strong.\nROMANA: Not one single atom can arrive on Gallifrey without authorisation, that's true — but —\nDOCTOR: — but a Presidential vessel, especially one carrying the head of the Celestial Intervention Agency —\nROMANA: - need give no warning of its arrival; its signature will guarantee its conveyance automatically. What is in that casket? (BEAT) Tell me!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think we can make a pretty good guess, don't you? How about — a critical mass of raw and ravenous Anti-Time? ANTI-CHARLEY: The casket will detonate as the Time Station materialises inside the barriers. A vast flood of Anti-Time will wash over the Capitol, swamping it, infecting it...\nDOCTOR: The Web of Time is already stretched at the seams. Gallifrey is the last bastion of positive time. All that maintains the constance of the Universe is the Eye of Harmony — and if that is contaminated...\nDOCTOR: 46\nROMANA: All things will flux, wither and change their state.\nDOCTOR: It will be as if the Time Lords had never existed!

ANTI-VOICE 1:Your Time is a prison —\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 2: You lock yourselves within it.\nROMANA: You don't believe that any more than I do, Laris. Your sense is so blunted by anger that you'd deprive the Universe of meaning. But you're right: if I've only got a few more microspans of purposeful existence remaining, I'm damned if I'm going to waste them trying to persuade you that bitterness has warped your reason. (BEAT) We're here. (FX: BLEEPS. DOOR SLIDES OPEN.) The Temporal Reactors. Are you coming, Vansell?\nVANSELL: (NO FX) What? Yes, yes — Romana.\nROMANA: (ENTERING REACTOR) Good.\nDOCTOR: There. The console chamber is now fully aligned to the TARDIS's power rhythms — 52\nDOCTOR: there'll be no more difficulties this end. We just have to wait for Romana.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Excellent. You will now assist the Under-Cardinal. Hurry! Under-Cardinal — connect these Delta Leads to the Radial Socket on the Lord Rassilon's casket. UNDER-CARDINAL: (CRACKLING FX) I will.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Now, Doctor — take the other end of the Delta Leads and wire them into the third panel on the Control Array.\nDOCTOR: You ought to hire a handyman, Sentris. (FX: HOISTS LEADS TO PANEL. BLEEPS -\nAND: ) Oh no you don't. Count me out. I'm not doing this!\nCHARLEY: What's she want you to do, Doctor? (STRUGGLING AGAINST STRAPS) I can't — see!\nDOCTOR: (TO ANTI-CHARLEY) You want someone to connect the casket to the Time Station's self- destruct mechanism, then find another pair of hands.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Oh Doctor, don't be so ... prissy. Commander Levith! Is your staser charged?\nLEVITH: (CRACKLING FX) It is.\nLEVITH: ANTI-CHARLEY: I shall count to three. If the Doctor has not completed his task by the time I've finished, I want you to raise your staser —\nLEVITH: (CRACKLING FX) — I understand —\nLEVITH: ANTI-CHARLEY: — and blast yourself through the head. One. Two. Three—\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) Alright, Sentris, you've made your point! (FX: CLUNKS. BEEPS) Happy now?\nCHARLEY: (TO DOCTOR) What's that done?\nDOCTOR: That has ensured that as soon as the Time Station materialises in Gallifrey's internal ionosphere, the ship's self-destruct mechanism will begin a short countdown. It will be completed the very nanosecond the casket opens —\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Spreading Anti-Time fallout over the maximum possible area, corrupting all of Gallifrey before the Time Lords can marshal any kind of response.\nCHARLEY: What — the Time Station will explode?\nCHARLEY: ANTI-CHARLEY: Miss Pollard, when I first tracked your form across space/time, I found your naivete engaging. Now, it begins to grate!\nCHARLEY: That's charming, that is. Doctor, will you kindly tell this Sentris person to — (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (LOST TO HIMSELF) Come on, Romana. What's going on?\nROMANA: You like to feast on Time, Korvan and Laris? Well, there you are — a cauldron of pure\nROMANA: Chronoplasmic Energy.\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 1: It is ... awesome.\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 2: We hunger for it.\nROMANA: Mouthwatering, is it? I wouldn't get too close if I were you — one inch past that Zybanium\nROMANA: Shield and even you will be atomised. Vansell — could I have your assistance? (BEAT; THEN,\nROMANA: WHISPERED) Correct me if I'm wrong, 'Acting President’ — but the casket's influence over you has\nROMANA: waned, hasn't it?\nVANSELL: I don't know — there's something wrong —\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) Careful! While Korvan and Laris are mesmerised by the Temporal\nROMANA: Reactors — let's not give the game away. (BEAT) You've been infected by the Anti-Time in the casket.\nROMANA: It's been influencing you, affecting your behaviour — maybe for even longer than you think. But its\nROMANA: hold over you seems to decrease with distance. Are you listening to me?\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) Oh, my lady — I remember now! I think I have done some terrible\nVANSELL: things...\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) You have — and the purges you colluded in back on Gallifrey were only\nROMANA: the beginning. So I ask you just this once — are you loyal? Come on, quick — the whole of reality may 53\nROMANA: hang on it!\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) Madam, I will serve you until the stars decay and the cosmos is naught but a dying ember in eternity's fire.\nROMANA: (DRILY) Well, the next five minutes will do. (WHISPERED) I need a distraction — time to get to the Matrix Chamber, change the authorisation code of this ship before it materialises and destroys the Eye of Harmony. Now — (FX: BLEEPS) — if we can lower both these shutters simultaneously, our floaty friends there will be trapped between the shutters and the Reactors - and if I then raise the Zybanium Shields, they'll be exposed to the Reactors’ cores. That should sort them out — at least, long enough for me to reach the next deck down. I need you to raise the other shutter, over there, exactly when I say — got it?\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) I understand. (BEAT) Will you ever forgive me? It's just —\nROMANA: (HISSING, FRUSTRATED) What?!?\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) You remember the Matrix Projection we saw? Of the possible future? We watched you — a different, strong, Imperial you — deciding the fate of the Daleks. You elected to collapse the time pocket they were trapped in, destroy them forever. Their Emperor was on the viewscreen. 'Have pity,’ it croaked. (FX: ON 'HAVE PITY’, WE HEAR THE DALEK EMPEROR\nRUNNING: OVER, IN TANDEM WITH VANSELL'S VOICE — DISTANCED, LIKE A FLASHBACK) And then you pressed the button, wiped them out, turned and said —\nROMANA: 'Does anyone else care to disagree with me?' (FX : ON 'DOES ANYONE ELSE ...', WE HEAR THE IMPERIATRIX ROMANA'S VOICE RUNNING OVER ROMANA'S LINE — DISTANCED, LIKE A FLASHBACK) I remember.\nVANSELL: (WHISPERED) You could have been so magnificent, so powerful — and yet —\nROMANA: (WHISPERED) I saw myself as a vile, twisted, hateful monster. And if you found that hideous distortion of everything that I am somehow admirable well, I feel very sorry for you, Vansell. (BEAT; THEN IMPATIENT) We’II\\ deal with this later, shall we? For now — will you kindly go and go and lower the other shutter?\nVANSELL: My lady. (WALKS AWAY)\nVANSELL: ANTI-VOICE 2:Are you not finished?\nROMANA: Nearly Laris, nearly (ACROSS ROOM, TO VANSELL) Are you ready, Vansell? After three. One. Two. Three —\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 1: What is this?!?\nROMANA: ANTI-VOICE 2: What is happening?\nVANSELL: (SLIGHTLY MUFFLED — BEHIND SHUTTER)\nVANSELL: My shutter — it’s jammed! (BEAT THEN QUITE CALM AND PROFESSIONAL) I ... 1 am opening the Zybanium Shield, my lady.\nROMANA: Vansell, you can’t! The shutter on your side’s not down — you’ ll be exposed to the Reactor Cores!\nVANSELL: I do this ... gladly. (FX: BLEEPS)\nVANSELL: ANTI-VOICE 1: No, Vansell!!! Do not open the shield —!\nVANSELL: (FX: A VAST ROARING OF EXPLOSED ENERGY, HEARD FROM BEHIND THE SHUTTER ON ROMANA’S SIDE. SCREAMS FROM BEHIND THE SHUTTER ON ROMANA’S SIDE.

Shame.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Quiet, Doctor! Under-Cardinal — can you follow the President's biorhythmic trace?\nDOCTOR: UNDER-CARDINAL: (CRACKLING FX) The Lady Romana is currently ... in the lower deck, hearding for —\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: — the Matrix Chamber! Seal the doors!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no you don’t, Under-Cardinal! (FX: PUNCH)\nDOCTOR: UNDER-CARDINAL: (CRACKLING FX) Oof!\nDOCTOR: Terribly sorry — don't know my own strength ...\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Levith — kill him!\nDOCTOR: Waah! Waah!

No more silly attempts at sabotage-\nDOCTOR: Solar Scout's honour!\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: And all to ensure the Lady Romana made it to the Matrix Chamber. I wonder\nDOCTOR: why? Ah. Of course. She's going to try and change the Time Station's conveyance signature from\nDOCTOR: inside the Matrix, isn't she?\nDOCTOR: (BASHFUL) Well, er — could be ...\nLEVITH: (CRACKLING FX) She cannot succeed, Doctor.\nLEVITH: ANTI-CHARLEY: See?

Typical CIA.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Oh, Doctor — don't dismiss it out of hand. I can't believe you haven't thought of it\nDOCTOR: yet!\nCHARLEY: Don't give up, Doctor! There's still a chance.

Shall I begin proton\nLEVITH: acceleration on the girl?\nLEVITH: ANTI-CHARLEY: Not just yet, Levith! This is too fascinating to miss!\nCHARLEY: It's me, isn't it, Doctor? Everything depends on me. So long as I'm alive, the breach in\nCHARLEY: space/time has co-ordinates — and that's how they're going to travel through. But if those co-ordinates 56\nCHARLEY: weren't there — well, they'd all be stuck in this reality, wouldn't they?\nDOCTOR: Charley, Charley, Charley — don't even think about it. ANTI-CHARLEY: Well, why not, Doctor? Miss Pollard indeed has a point. Commander Levith — place your staser on the ground, at the Doctor's feet.\nLEVITH: (CRACKLING FX) Sentris, are you —? ANTI-CHARLEY: Oh, I am sure. (BEAT) Go on, Doctor. Pick it up.\nDOCTOR: This isn't a game, Sentris! ANTI-CHARLEY: No. It isn't. It's a matter of life and death. The girl's life — against the death of the Web of Time which your entire civilisation was constructed to protect. Pick it up. There. That didn't hurt, did it?\nCHARLEY: It's alright, Doctor. I'm not afraid. It's like I said in the TARDIS — my time is up! There is no alternative. (BEAT) Oh, Doctor — you rescued me from the R 101 ; you gave me these last few wonderful months. The things that I've seen, the places I've been — I've lived more than I could ever have dreamed of, and all thanks to you! And you're the sweetest, the kindest, most wonderful man I've ever met — an I'm sorry it's come to this and I'm sorry it has to end like this but if the Web of Time is destroyed then all the time I've had, everywhere I've been, all these fabulous, fantastic things we've done — they won't ever have happened at all! Don't let those times be taken away; don't let it all go to waste. I know it's an awful and terrible thing, but I want you to do it! Oh, Doctor — please do it, before it's too late!\nDOCTOR: Charley, I— I can't. You're my friend and I love you. I can't look you in the eye and shoot you, no matter what!\nCHARLEY: Doctor, I love you too and this is no way to say goodbye but please, please — (BEAT) Oh, what's wrong with you?!? You've saved the universe before — so do it again, the only way how! ANTI-CHARLEY: That's right, Doctor. It won't take much. A quick burst of staser-fire and all these troubles will be over. And if your conscience pricks a little — well, it'll all have been in the noblest possible cause.\nCHARLEY: (BLAZING) Oh, shut up, Sentris! (BEAT) You think we're alike, don't you? That's why you took my form. But we're not. We both died before our time — whether we should or we shouldn't, it just doesn't matter. The difference is, I'm grateful for every second that I've had. Charlotte Pollard, Edwardian Adventuress! We measure our lives in love, and I've loved every minute. But you, and all the lost boys and girls in your Never-Never Land — you're so fixated on what you might have missed out on, you've forgotten what living was like. I could get angry, too. I'm so scared, you know. But we're born into love, not anger — and love never dies, however brief our lives might be. (BEAT) Now, Doctor. Do it now.\nDOCTOR: I —I can't, Charley. I can't. I'm sorry.\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Pick up the staser, Levith.\nCHARLEY: No!!! No, no, no, no, no! I don't want it to be like this! ANTI-CHARLEY: And now, Levith — activate the breach.

(BEAT) Well, Doctor. We have very few hands — just Levith, the Under-Cardinal and a handful of guards. Perhaps if you were to shoot all of them, then maybe the final outcome could be averted? But you won't. All hail the Doctor — the hero so squeamish he stood by while all that he loved was condemned to extinction!\nDOCTOR: Sentris, you're not just evil and vindictive — you're confused. Once, you were so sickened by killing that you blasted yourself into this state. I won't destroy my friend, and I won't be ashamed of the fact! Can't you see what you're doing? You're going to unmake the lives of innumerable billions if you carry this out! Don't they matter? Don't innocents count?\nDOCTOR: 37\nDOCTOR: ANTY-CHARLEY: The living? No. Don't judge me, Doctor. I'm just looking after my own — something you've proved yourself quite incapable of. You see, once in a while, you have to pick sides. And if you don't stand with your own kind, well — you're a traitor. So hang your head, Doctor — you've betrayed the whole Web of Time because you can't bear to bloody your hands. How does that feel? (BEAT) Under- Cardinal! Is our course set for Gallifrey?\nDOCTOR: UNDER-CARDINAL: (CRACKLING FX) Course computed, Sentris!\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: Then commence the final dematerialisation!\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) 'The final dematerialisation' ... ?

Raise your staser — and shoot him through both his bleeding hearts.\nLEVITH: (CRACKLING FX) Yes, Sentris.\nLEVITH: (FX: TWO STASER BLASTS - BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE HEAR THE TARDIS DOORS\nBANGING: SHUT.

Nearly there — nearly at the breach, and then — that's it, yes! (BEAT) Now: I can't pretend this next bit isn't going to hurt. I have to reconfigure your superstructure, and I can't do it gently. Brace yourself —\nDOCTOR: What? You pick your moments, old girl — but not now! Please don't jam on me now!\nOLD MAN: (SUDDENLY APPEARED) My friend, the mechanism is not at fault.\nDOCTOR: (CAUGHT UNAWARES) You?!? It is you. Really you. (BEAT; HARD) My Lord, Iam truly humbled — but I beg of you: do not intervene.\nOLD MAN: Oh, Doctor. You should know better than to even suggest it. I have simply frozen us here — perhaps in your TARDIS perhaps, in your mind. Time marches on.\nDOCTOR: It might not, soon. What you showed me, in the Matrix — the past and the future sacrificed to one single present — it could happen, now, unless ... well, unless I'm allowed to do what. I mean to do.\nOLD MAN: Then this is surely a desperate hour. Tell me, Doctor. Tell me how all this has come to pass.\nDOCTOR: My Lord — I don't have the time!\nOLD MAN: You do now. You can humour an old, dead man, can you not?\nDOCTOR: I — well, if you're sure. Where did it all begin? One night on Earth, I suppose, high above the English Channel. I was aboard a magnificent airship — a vessel they called the RIOI. There was a boy, a steward, running towards me, running from someone — or something. But it wasn't a boy at all. It was a girl — Charlotte. Charlotte Pollard. Friends called her Charley, she said. (FX: BEGIN TO FADE) She told me I was the oddest man she'd ever met...\nDOCTOR: ANTI-CHARLEY: The breach! The breach! We ... are ... going ... through! 58\nDOCTOR: [ honestly believed that Grayle was behind the time disruption. That with his redemption, I need worry no longer. I meant every word I said to Charley. I should have known better.\nOLD MAN: Indeed! And what else do you have to tell me?\nDOCTOR: I think the rest of the story can speak for itself, my Lord. Let's just say, not long after we left Singapore, Charley and I discovered that our troubles were only just beginning, first with the Daleks and now ... (BEAT) now, it's come to this. I have to stop the Never-people from reaching Gallifrey, regardless of the consequences to myself.\nOLD MAN: And you mean those words too?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely.\nOLD MAN: You have considered every alternative?\nDOCTOR: [ have.\nOLD MAN: Then I must let you continue.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, my Lord. (BEAT) Before you go — might I just ask why you've — well, dropped in on me like this?\nOLD MAN: Doctor. I told you. I wanted to know what led you here, to this — decision. But if your mind is made up, I cannot intervene. That causes me sorrow.\nDOCTOR: Sorrow?\nOLD MAN: I have watched you these many long years — I have seen you in all of your adventures, seen the many things you have done in the service of your beliefs. Some I can hardly be seen to approve of ...\nDOCTOR: (COY, BASHFUL) Oh. Well. You know. Sometimes things don't work out quite the way you planned them.\nOLD MAN: Indeed. But for the most part — Doctor, you have made me proud. You have enriched the lives of more people in more worlds than I suspect you will ever know. You have made a difference. And I come here simply to tell you that. Before everything is ended. Before it's too late.\nDOCTOR: My Lord — you honour me.\nOLD MAN: No, Doctor. You have honoured me. Farewell.\nOLD MAN: (FX: SNAPS FINGERS —\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Eh? Is it just me, or did something very odd just — (BEAT) Doesn't matter. Now, where was I?

I hope I still have much to offer the people of Gallifrey, especially after today.\nOLD MAN: Then it is our wish you should continue in her stewardship.\nROMANA: A doorway!\nOLD MAN: Go with our blessing, Daughter of Time.\nROMANA: I - thank you, my Lord. The first thing I will do is rescue Miss Pollard, find a space for her in history's pages.\nOLD MAN: Miss Pollard? Oh, her story is not quite finished. In fact it's only just beginning. As the next chapter unfolds — and a dark and terrible chapter it is — I trust you to play your part, Romana, with all the wisdom and passion you have displayed today.\nROMANA: The next chapter? What do you mean? What's going to — (BEAT) Sorry, my Lord. I didn't mean to —\nOLD MAN: (LAUGHING) If you do not wish to remain, I cannot grant you that knowledge.\nROMANA: Of course. I'll just have to take it — well, one day at a time.\nOLD MAN: Go, Madam President. Go into the future.\nROMANA: I will. (BEAT) My Lord.\nOLD MAN: Farewell, daughter. We wish you well ... (WALKING AWAY, QUOTING TO HIMSELF) '... for Zagreus waits at the end of the world/And Zagreus is the end of the world/His time is the end of Time/And his moment, Time's undoing ...'\nOLD MAN: 61\nOLD MAN: (FX: VAST, BARREN, STONE-WALLED ATMOS. FAINT GRACKLES AND HISSES OF EXPENDED ANTI-TIME ENERGY — LIKE ON RASSILON'S CASKET)\nCHARLEY: Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Oh, Doctor — are you there?\nCHARLEY: Doctor? Doctor, is that you? It's so dark and cold in here, I can hardly —\nDOCTOR: (HISSING) Keep away!\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Doctor — it is you! Is this the TARDIS? I mean, what's happened? It's all been like a dream — I found myself here, when I was last in the Time Station with those awful Never-people and —\nCHARLEY: Oh Doctor — come on, let me help you —\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) I said — keep away!\nCHARLEY: Oh! (BEAT) Doctor — what's wrong? Have you been injured, or something?\nDOCTOR: Injured? No, I have not been injured. This TARDIS contained all of the Time Station when it exploded. This ship was filled to bursting with a great mass of the fiercest, fizzing, energy —\nCHARLEY: What, Anti-Time?\nDOCTOR: A crude term for such matter of life ... and death. But now that the breach is resolved — now that the problem of you is resolved — well, all that remains of that stuff in this whole reality is held ... in here.\nCHARLEY: What, in the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: (CHUCKLING EVILLY — HINT OF CRACKLING FX ON HIS VOICE) No. In ... here.\nCHARLEY: Y- you're scaring me now. Stop it, Doctor, please —\nDOCTOR: (RISING CRACKLING FX) 'Doctor'? 'Doctor'? I hold the last vestiges of the most awesome power ever imagined. Imagined — yes! How much better if I should take my title from a work of imagination — a creature willed to power by the undying anger of an unreal race!\nCHARLEY: Doctor, I haven't got the faintest idea what you're on about but I really think you need help so if you'll just let me —\nDOCTOR: Yaaaa!\nCHARLEY: Aaaah! (BEAT) (SHOCKED, FRIGHTENED) Doctor — Doctor, what's wrong with you?\nDOCTOR: (CRACKLING FX) I told you, girl — (BELLOWED) 1... AM... NOT ... THE DOCTOR!!! (BEAT) I am become he who sits inside your head ... he who lives among the dead ... he who sees you in your bed ... and eats you when you're sleeping. (BEAT) I ... am become ... ZAGREUS!!!\nDOCTOR: 62"
