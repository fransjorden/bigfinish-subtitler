Expecting trouble?\nSIBOR: The fortress? Oh, you mean the Alcazar. No. That is our penitentiary. Our prison.\nDOCTOR: Prison?\nSIBOR: This planet was initially settled as a penal colony, to house the most dangerous criminals from across the Earth empire.\nTURLOUGH: Must make you feel right at home, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Very funny.\nNYSSA: You still haven’t explained how you knew we would come here.\nSIBOR: All will be revealed in due course.

LABORATORY (CONTINUOUS)\nMAHANDRA: But I thought your mother was dead. That girl, she must be twenty years younger than you!\nADRIC: You don’t understand. When my mother was a young woman, she travelled in a machine called the TARDIS. A time machine.\nMAHANDRA: A time machine?\nADRIC: I know it’s hard to believe, but when I was a boy she used to tell me stories about the adventures she had when she travelled with the Doctor.\nMAHANDRA: And while she was travelling with the Doctor, she came here, now?\nADRIC: Yes. This must be at a point in her life before I was born.\nMAHANDRA: So, did she ever tell you about the time she came here?\nADRIC: No. And she never mentioned meeting me, as a grown man.\nMAHANDRA: Maybe she forgot?\nADRIC: No. She must’ve avoided mentioning it for a reason. I remember her telling me about the dangers of altering history. That once something has happened, it can’t, mustn’t be changed.\nMAHANDRA: So?\nADRIC: So when she came here, she can’t have met me, or she’d have told me about it. So I can’t meet her now.\nMAHANDRA: But if she’s your mother, don’t you want to speak to her?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nADRIC: Don’t you understand? I can’t. That would create a contradiction, a time paradox.\nMAHANDRA: There is one way you can speak to her.\nADRIC: What?\nMAHANDRA: You don’t tell her who you are.\nADRIC: I might be twenty-five years older than when she last saw me, but I think she’d still recognise her own son!\nMAHANDRA: Not if he was wearing a mask.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. ELECTOR’S RESIDENCE\nDOCTOR WHO: MOTORS. INSIDE, THE DOCTOR AND FRIENDS WALK ALONG A STONE- FLOORED CORRIDOR.\nTURLOUGH: Our arrival was predicted by a ‘Chronoscope’?\nSIBOR: Indeed. It showed us your craft materializing in the town.\nTEGAN: Sorry — you’re saying you’ve got a machine that lets you see into the future?\nSIBOR: The Chronoscope foretells events of significance, yes.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. I expect it comes in useful for weather forecasts too?\nSIBOR: It enables us to make preparations for any severe atmospheric events, yes.\nNYSSA: But surely, in a chaotic system, no prediction can ever been completely accurate.\nSIBOR: You’re wrong. The Chronoscope’s predictions are always correct.\nDOCTOR: Always? Every single time? Without fail?\nDOCTOR: WITH A TRICKLING FOUNTAIN OR AIR CONDITIONING.\nSIBOR: Always. It has brought peace, prosperity and security to this world. Accidents are a thing of the past. Preventable illness is a thing of the past. All forms of crime are a thing of the past.\nTURLOUGH: Because any criminal act can be predicted?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nSIBOR: Predicted and prevented, enabling us to bring the would-be perpetrators to justice before the crime has even been committed. It’s the perfect system.\nTEGAN: So no-one can ever break the law?\nSIBOR: Not quite. In fact, I have to go and chair a judicial hearing at this very moment. If you’d care to wait here, you’1ll be able to observe the proceedings on the viewscreen here.\nDOCTOR: Well, that would be most kind.\nSIBOR: If you’ll excuse me-?\nNYSSA: She seems very accommodating.\nTEGAN: Yeah. A bit too accommodating, if you ask me. .\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9. INT. COURTROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: FUTURISTIC SET-UP. SALEM WITCH TRIALS ATMOSPHERE.\nKARTIS: I’m innocent, for worship’s sake. Innocent!\nSIBOR: Maintenance engineer Ralvo Kartis. You stand indicted of premeditation to murder. Do you understand the nature of the charge?\nKARTIS: Yes, I understand it, you’ve arrested me for something I was never going to do!\nSIBOR: Replay the prediction.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Kartis, please, don’t do this.\nKARTIS: I’m sorry. I don’t have any choice.\nKARTIS: You have to die.\nSIBOR TARDIS: No, please, I beg you — stop!\nSIBOR TARDIS: GALLERY IS ALARMED.\nSIBOR: The prediction is clear. Had you not been detained you would have attempted to kill me.\nKARTIS: The Chronoscope’s wrong! Why would I want to kill you?\nSIBOR: Maintenance Engineer Kartis. You are hereby declared guilty of premeditation to murder. You are to be detained in the Alcazar for the rest of your natural life. Watchmen — take him away.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. INT. ELECTOR’S RESIDENCE (CONTINUOUS )\nKARTIS: (VIA MONITOR) I wasn’t going to kill you! I wasn’t — [going to]!\nTEGAN: They sentenced that guy to life just based on a prediction?\nDOCTOR: Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? If any crime can be predicted, why would anyone attempt to break the law?\nTEGAN: But Kartis must’ve thought he’d be able to get away with it, otherwise why would he have planned to shoot Sibor?\nDOCTOR: Unless the Chronoscope wasn’t telling the whole truth. I wonder what it actually is...\nDOCTOR: MUFFLED AS HE’S WEARING A FACE MASK.\nADRIC: (MASKED) Forgive me for disturbing you, but Sibor suggested I might keep you company.\nTEGAN: And who might you be?\nADRIC: (MASKED) My name is Galen. I am the chief physician of the colony.\nDOCTOR: Delighted to meet you. I’m the Doctor, this is Tegan, Turlough, and Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Hello.\nADRIC: (MASKED) Nyssa. It’s good to meet you.\nNYSSA: (WARY) It is..?\nDOCTOR: ‘Galen?’ Named after Galen of Pergamon, I presume?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nADRIC: (MASKED) You are remarkably well-informed, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That’s what he said.\nTURLOUGH: What happened to your face? If you don’t mind me asking.\nTEGAN: (ADMONISHING) Turlough—!\nADRIC: (MASKED) It’s quite alright. There was an accident in my laboratory involving a vitreous solution. The mask accelerates the healing process. Now: Sibor said you were travellers. And I’m afraid my duties include checking new arrivals for any Signs of infection.\nTEGAN: What are you insinuating?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Nothing at all. It’s just that as a small, isolated colony, we can’t be too careful. Don’t worry, the process is entirely non-invasive, thanks to this bio-scanner.\nNYSSA: Well, I can’t see the harm.\nDOCTOR: Anything to set our hosts’ minds at rest. After all, we are their guests.\nADRIC: (MASKED) Remarkable. According to the scanner, you, Nyssa, and Turlough all have non-terrestrial physiologies and are free of infection.\nDOCTOR: That’s good to hear.\nADRIC: (MASKED) While you.. Tegan, you are human, but with a micro- biome quite unlike any I’ve seen before.\nTEGAN: A what?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nADRIC: (MASKED) According to the scanner, your body contains micro- organisms which have been unknown for over a thousand years, while your DNA lacks any synthetic modification. If I didn’t know better, I would say you were the product of an ancient civilisation.\nTURLOUGH: Well, Tegan here is a bit of a genetic throwback, it’s true.\nTEGAN: Thanks a bundle!\nADRIC: (MASKED) Please don’t be offended, but it appears that you are in possession of a selection of immunities which we have since lost. Immunities which could be extremely useful.\nNYSSA: Of course — because Tegan has been exposed to diseases since eradicated.\nTEGAN: (SARCASTIC) Of course. That’s what growing up in Brisbane does for you.\nADRIC: (MASKED) I would be extremely grateful if you could assist me in my research. It won’t cause you any discomfort, I promise. And it might enable me to save lives.\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He’s right, it could save lives.\nTEGAN: Well, alright then. If you insist.\nADRIC: (MASKED) If you’d like to follow me, we can begin at once.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Have you forgotten? The TARDIS was brought here by something...\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: I haven’t forgotten. But there’s no need to be uncivil, is there?\nNYSSA: Doctor. Do you think it’s theoretically possible? For a machine to accurately predict the future?\nDOCTOR: Well, it seems to have foreseen our arrival. Which it couldn’t possibly have done unless it could genuinely see into the future. Or...\nTURLOUGH: Or it was responsible for bringing us here.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The thought had occurred.\nSIBOR: (SWEEPING IN) My sincere apologies for keeping you all waiting.\nDOCTOR: Not at all, I realise you must have a busy schedule.\nSIBOR: You appear to have lost one of your number?\nNYSSA: Tegan just left to assist your chief physician with his research.\nSIBOR: Ah, I see. Well. Did you find the judicial hearing instructive?\nDOCTOR: Most educational, yes. I’d like to learn more about this Chronoscope. It seems a remarkably useful gadget. Wherever did you pick it up?\nSIBOR: I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.\nTURLOUGH: Well, you must’ve got it from somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Unless you built it yourself, of course? Could I at least take a look at it?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nSIBOR: That will not be possible. The Chronoscope is held in a secure, secret location.\nNYSSA: A secure location from which it transmits its predictions?\nSIBOR: Indeed. Whenever it has a prediction, the forecast is relayed to this building.\nDOCTOR: Whenever it has a prediction? So you don’t actually control it, then?\nSIBOR: It makes a prediction whenever a significant event is about to occur.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t get to decide what constitutes a significant event, do you?\nSIBOR: I’m afraid I don’t follow your meaning.\nTURLOUGH: Isn’t it obvious? Your machine only shows you what it wants you to see!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. INT. LABORATORY\nTEGAN: You’re not going to be sticking needles into me, are you?\nADRIC: (MASKED) That won’t be necessary. You see, I’ve brought you here under false pretences.\nTEGAN: What?\nADRIC: (MASKED) I wished to speak to you in private. Because I know the truth about you all.\nTEGAN: What ‘truth’?\nADRIC: (MASKED) That you travel in time, in a machine called the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Who told you that?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Nyssa. Or rather, she will do. In her future.\nTEGAN: I don’t understand.\nADRIC: (MASKED) At some point in her future, Nyssa will leave you, and several years after that, she will tell me about you.\nTEGAN: Why should I believe you?\nADRIC: (MASKED) I know about what happened when you visited Earth in the seventeenth century. I know about Omega. I know about the Cybermen, and Adric, who died fighting them.\nTEGAN: Okay, so you know Nyssa. You brought me here to tell me that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nADRIC: (MASKED) No. I brought you here because I need your help. You see, several years after she leaves you, Nyssa will go ona mission to a planet called Helheim.\nTEGAN: Yes, I — (STOPS HERSELF) This hasn’t happened yet?\nADRIC: (MASKED) As far as Nyssa is concerned, no. As far as I’m concerned, it happened twenty-five years ago. But after she landed on Helheim there was an... accident. An accident that resulted in the destruction of her scout ship.\nTEGAN: Why are you telling me this?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Because you have a time machine. After Nyssa leaves you, you and the Doctor can travel to Helheim, where you can rescue her! You can take her with you!\nTEGAN: Wouldn’t that be changing history?\nADRIC: (MASKED) No. Her body was never found, so it wouldn’t change a thing. Well, Tegan? Will you do it?\nTEGAN: I’m not doing anything, not until I know exactly who you are, and why what happens to Nyssa matters so much to you.\nADRIC: (MASKED) .. Because I’m her son!\nTEGAN: Her son...!\nADRIC: (REMOVING MASK) Enough of this mask! (CLEAR NOW) My name is Adric.\nTEGAN: (PRETENDING TO BE SURPRISED) Adric?\nADRIC: She’s my mother. My mother who’s been missing, presumed dead, Since I was fifteen years old!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12. INT. ELECTOR’S RESIDENCE.\nTURLOUGH: Oh dear. I think we may have insulted our host.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that did seem to touch a nerve. No wonder she stormed out.\nNYSSA: So what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: I’d still like to know more about this Chronoscope. Kartis might be a good person to ask.\nTURLOUGH: The man we saw being convicted of murder?\nDOCTOR: If you want to hear the truth, ask somebody with nothing left to lose.\nDOCTOR: Tegan! How was your visit with Galen?\nTEGAN: I need to talk to you, Doctor. In private.\nDOCTOR: Really? Well, if you think that’s necessary... Turlough, Nyssa. See if you can arrange an interview with Kartis before he’s transferred to the prison. I’1ll catch you up.\nTURLOUGH: But —\nNYSSA: Come on, Turlough. Let’s leave them to it.\nTURLOUGH: Alright, I’11 do as I’m told.\nDOCTOR: Now. What did you want to speak to me about?\nTEGAN: Doctor. The man I saw, Galen. He knows Nyssa.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: Sorry, what?\nTEGAN: He’s a friend of hers, from after we left her on Terminus.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That could make things a little complicated.\nTEGAN: That’s why he was wearing a mask, so she wouldn’t recognise him. Because he thinks the Nyssa we’re travelling with is from before we went to Terminus.\nDOCTOR: . Because she appears to be the same age now as she was then.\nTEGAN: Right. And — give me a sec, because this is where it gets confusing — after Nyssa leaves us, he wants us to go to the planet Helheim, and save her. Because as far as he’s concerned, Nyssa never came back. He thinks she died there.\nDOCTOR: But she didn’t. That’s when we picked her up.\nTEGAN: But he doesn’t know that! The point is, after Nyssa went missing in thirty-five thirty, she never returned to her own time.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I see.\nTEGAN: Which means you never managed to take her back home again. Which means you never will!\nDOCTOR: Yes. By becoming part of the consequences of an event, we can no longer influence that event. Not without creating a paradox.\nTEGAN: Or in other words, by bringing us here, you’ve prevented Nyssa from ever returning to her own time.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t bring us here. We were dragged off-course.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nTEGAN: The result’s the same, though, isn’t it? It’s now thirty-five fifty-six. Which means for twenty-five years, millions of people have been dying of Richter’s disease. People who’d still be alive if Nyssa had been able to return to thirty-five thirty with the cure!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. INT. COURTHOUSE CELL.\nDOCTOR WHO: DUNGEON ECHO.\nKARTIS: I’d never kill anyone, I’m not a murderer. And if the Chronoscope lied about me, how many others has it lied about Since the ‘day of the miracle’?\nNYSSA: But why send innocent people to prison?\nTURLOUGH: As a reminder. If you can convince people that it’s futile to even think about breaking the law, they’1ll obey the people in charge.\nTURLOUGH: LIKE A STORMTROOPER.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Time’s up. Prisoner is due to be transferred to the Alcazar.\nKARTIS: Goodbye... Turlough — Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Goodbye, Kartis.\nTEGAN: There you are!\nNYSSA: Tegan! Doctor —!\nDOCTOR: Change of plan. We have to go.\nTURLOUGH: Go?\nDOCTOR: Leave. Get off this planet. Now.\nTURLOUGH: Why?\nNYSSA: Yes, Doctor. Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nTURLOUGH: It’s something to do with Galen, isn’t it? Something he told Tegan.\nTEGAN: It’s none of your business.\nDOCTOR: For once, Tegan’s right, it really is none of your concern.\nTURLOUGH: No? Because you don’t trust me. Wherever we go, it’s the same story. I’m kept in the dark about what’s really going on.\nDOCTOR: Turlough, this isn’t the time.\nTURLOUGH: Then when is? When will I have proved myself to you?\nTEGAN: For goodness’ sake. Of all the adolescent —\nTURLOUGH: Adolescent? Alright, then — if you won’t tell me, I’1l go and ask Galen instead. (LEAVES)\nTEGAN: (AS HE DEPARTS) Turlough, you’re being pathetic-!\nDOCTOR: Let him go, Tegan.\nNYSSA: Aren’t you going to go after him?\nDOCTOR: Later. First we have to get you back to the TARDIS.\nNYSSA: But why? Why is it so important that we should leave?\nDOCTOR: Please. Just this once, do as I say without asking questions!\nTEGAN: The Doctor’s right. You have to get out of here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. LABORATORY\nMAHANDRA: The chief physician is not to be disturbed —\nTURLOUGH: I’‘’1ll only be a few moments. Ah. And I see that Galen no longer needs a mask.\nADRIC: It’s alright, Mahandra.\nMAHANDRA: Very good.\nADRIC: There was no need to force your way in. If there’s something you wish to discuss —\nTURLOUGH: There is. I want to know what you told Tegan.\nADRIC: Turlough, isn’t it? My mother mentioned you. You travelled together. Briefly.\nTURLOUGH: Your mother?\nADRIC: Nyssa.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry? Nyssa is your mother?\nADRIC: Yes. Or rather, she will be. That’s all in the future as far as she’s concerned. That’s why I was wearing the mask, to avoid creating a time paradox.\nTURLOUGH: And that’s what you told Tegan?\nADRIC: I asked her to save Nyssa. Because twenty-five years ago, ona mission to the planet Helheim, my mother disappeared.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nTURLOUGH: (SURPRISED LAUGH) No she didn’t.\nADRIC: What?\nTURLOUGH: After she left us, we bumped into her again. A few days later, or fifty years later, as far as she was concerned.\nADRIC: You're saying you’ve already been to Helheim?\nTURLOUGH: You said she mentioned me to you. What did she say, exactly?\nADRIC: That she met you on Earth, at Brendon School, with a Brigadier, and a creature called Mawdryn. And that’s it.\nTURLOUGH: She didn’t mention Purity? Or Vektris? Or the Sontarans?\nADRIC: No.\nTURLOUGH: No. Because she had you in the fifty-year gap before we met her again.\nADRIC: But if the Nyssa with you is from after she went to Helheim, why does she look younger?\nTURLOUGH: Because she was rejuvenated, by a substance called Hermogenite.\nADRIC: You mean my mother... who I thought had died, when I was fifteen years old... she’s been travelling with you all this time?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. EXT. STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: LIVESTOCK CLUCKING AND SNORTING, TRADERS PACKING UP IN B/G.\nDOCTOR: This way, I think. Yes! Follow me!\nDOCTOR: PRIVATE.\nNYSSA: Tegan. Will you please tell me why we have to leave?\nTEGAN: (QUIET) You know how you wanted us to take you back to your own time, to thirty-five thirty?\nNYSSA: Yes. So I could deliver the cure for Richter’s syndrome.\nTEGAN: And return to your husband, and your children?\nNYSSA: Tegan, you haven’t told the Doctor about them, have you?\nTEGAN: No, don’t worry, I’ve been playing my cards close to my chest. But what if.. what if I told you, that you couldn’t go back and pick up your life from where you’d left off?\nNYSSA: What are you saying?\nTEGAN: The year is thirty-five fifty-six. We’re walking around in your future.\nNYSSA: My future. And so the longer I remain here, the greater the chance of me finding out what happens to me...\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Nyssa — what are you waiting for?\nNYSSA: Doctor. Tegan’s told me. About why we have to leave.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR: (FEARING THE WORST) She has?\nNYSSA: Because by being here I risk discovering something about my own\nNYSSA: future.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes.\nNYSSA: You’re right. I should leave. I don’t know why you couldn’t just tell me.\nDOCTOR: Because it was important I got you back to the TARDIS, before —\nMAHANDRA: Halt. Do not move.\nDOCTOR: - before this.\nTEGAN: Mahandra, right? What’s with the handgun?\nMAHANDRA: Chief physician Galen wishes to speak to you.\nTEGAN: (BEMUSED) He’s already spoken to me.\nMAHANDRA: Not to you. To Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Why?\nMAHANDRA: He will answer that. You will all come with me. Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. EXT. OUTSIDE LABORATORY.\nDOCTOR WHO: RATTLING METAL STAIRS TO THE BALCONY OUTSIDE OF THE LABORATORY; OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS.\nMAHANDRA: Wait here.\nADRIC: (MASKED) Doctor, Nyssa. Tegan. How pleasant to make your re- acquaintance.\nDOCTOR: Well, we’re very pleasant company. I see you’ve been speaking to Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: (GUILTY) Doctor, I didn’t realise. You should’ve told me —\nDOCTOR: Told you what?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Nyssa, if you would care to step inside with Mahandra...\nNYSSA: If you insist.\nDOCTOR: Galen. Listen to me. I know you’re an acquaintance of Nyssa’s, from her future.\nADRIC: (MASKED) An acquaintance? Is that what you told him, Tegan?\nTEGAN: ‘Friend’ seemed to be over-doing it.\nDOCTOR: You have to understand, Nyssa must not find out about anything that happens to her after she leaves us. If she does, it could result in a time paradox.\nADRIC: (MASKED) Oh, don’t lie to me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: What?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Turlough’s already told me. About how you rescued Nyssa from Helheim.\nTEGAN: (FURIOUS) Turlough told you?-?!\nTURLOUGH: I didn’t realise it was meant to be a secret!\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t make any difference. You still can’t tell Nyssa about her own future.\nADRIC: (MASKED) And how could I do that? I have no idea what will\nADRIC: happen to her. All I know is that she never came home.\nDOCTOR: Galen, please-!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. LABORATORY (CONTINUOUS )\nADRIC: (MASKED) Mahandra, if you could keep an eye on the others outside? I don’t want any interruptions.\nMAHANDRA: As you wish.\nNYSSA: Why did you have her bring me here?\nADRIC: (MASKED) Because I wished for you — (REMOVES MASK) — for you to see my face. (BEAT) Well? Don’t you recognise me?\nNYSSA: (SHE DOES, BUT PRETENDS SHE DOESN’T) No, no I don’t. I’ve never seen you before in my life.\nADRIC: Mother, it’s me. Twenty-five years older than when you last saw me. I’m Adric. Your son!\nNYSSA: (LYING) I... I don’t have a son.\nADRIC: Mother, please-!\nNYSSA: Please, I’m only twenty years old. If you’re from my future then I can’t know about it!\nADRIC: Mother, you don’t have to pretend. Your friend Turlough told me that you were made young again. Younger than I remember you. Younger than your own son.\nNYSSA: (OVERCOME) My own son... Adric!\nADRIC: My mother. Back from the dead.\nNYSSA: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nADRIC: We all thought you’d died, when you never returned from your mission to Helheim.\nNYSSA: I never came back?\nADRIC: No. The last time I saw you was when you kissed me goodbye.\nNYSSA: I’m so sorry. I meant to come back. Truly, I did!\nADRIC: (ANGRY) Then why didn’t you? What was more important to you than me? Than Neeka? What was more important than your own son, crying himself to sleep, night after night?\nNYSSA: I never meant for it to be like this. If I could go back to that time, I would, but...\nADRIC: But what?\nNYSSA: . but now that I’ve met you here, I can’t, can I? I can’t!\nADRIC: You let me think you were dead! For twenty-five years!\nNYSSA: Don’t you think I’d do anything, anything, to put things right, to get those years back? To go back to thirty-five thirty with the cure for Richter’s —\nADRIC: (SHARPLY) What did you say? You found a cure?\nNYSSA: (MISERABLE) Yes.\nADRIC: And still you never came back? (APPALLED) Mother - do you have any idea how many people have died of Richter’s in the last twenty-five years? Do you have any idea of the suffering its caused? To people like Neeka?\nNYSSA: My daughter. Oh no, no —\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 37\nADRIC: Don’t worry. She’s still alive. In suspended animation on Maxis Realtor. She became infected while treating the sick.\nNYSSA: And your father? Where’s he? Where’s Lasarti?\nADRIC: He died. Ten years ago. He died alone.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry, Adric. What more can I say? I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. EXT. OUTSIDE LABORATORY.\nTURLOUGH: I think we can assume that he’s telling her everything.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I don’t suppose she will ever forgive me.\nMAHANDRA: Sibor? What are you-\nSIBOR: There they are. Watchmen! Arrest the woman Tegan and the man Turlough.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Yes, ma’am.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: APPREHEND THEM, COCKING MACHINE GUNS.\nTEGAN: Arrest us? What for?\nTURLOUGH: We’ve done nothing wrong!\nSIBOR: Not yet. But the Chronoscope has just made a prediction. It has shown the pair of you committing cold-blooded murder.\nTEGAN: But that’s ridiculous!\nTURLOUGH: Who would we want to murder?\nSIBOR: One of my Watchmen, whilst attempting to make your escape.\nDOCTOR: And the Chronoscope is never wrong...!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 39"

Father buried himself in his work and I enrolled at the college on Triesto, got a first class degree in xeno-medicine, and specialised in the treatment of Richter’s. To help people, and honour your memory.\nNYSSA: And Neeka?\nADRIC: She became a medic. She’d go to the pariah worlds and tend to the sick even as the cities were being overrun. She saw whole populations reduced to blood-thirsty savages. In the end, she became infected, a microscopic tear in her hazard suit. She was thirty-five when it happened. My older sister and she’s younger than me now.\nNYSSA: And all this time, you’ve been working to find a cure.\nADRIC: Why else do you think I came to Valderon? To further my research I needed experimental subjects. And this was the only world with a ready supply of... volunteers.\nNYSSA: Volunteers? (REALISES) This is a penal colony!\nADRIC: The prisoners can either help me with my work, or remain in the Alcazar.\nNYSSA: That’s not much of a choice. What exactly have you been doing to your ‘volunteers’?\nADRIC: Each subject is infected with Richter’s, then injected with an anti-viral compound, to evaluate its efficacy at delaying the progress of the disease.\nNYSSA: And then what happens to them?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 40\nADRIC: They’re placed in cryogen storage.\nNYSSA: Still infected with Richter’s!\nADRIC: Does it matter? I had to find a cure somehow! And I was on the right track, I’m sure of it!\nNYSSA: You’re just like your father. Never give up.\nADRIC: You don’t understand. I know I would’ve found a cure because the Chronoscope predicted it.\nNYSSA: Except it wasn’t you that found it. It was me. That’s what the Chronoscope predicted.\nADRIC: At least I was trying to find a cure — rather than travelling the galaxy with the Doctor having already found it.\nNYSSA: I meant to come back, Adric, but travelling with the Doctor, things have a tendency to get in the way.\nADRIC: That’s your excuse, is it?\nNYSSA: An explanation. I can’t undo the past. Much as I would wish to.\nADRIC: So what is it? The cure?\nNYSSA: It’s an adapted form of the antigen of a creature called a Cractid. I have a sample in the TARDIS.\nADRIC: Then you’d better fetch it, hadn’t you?\nNYSSA: Adric, it’s not as simple as that! I developed a vaccine, yes, but it soon became unstable — because the virus itself is constantly mutating.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 41\nADRIC: Which means it evolves a resistance to any vaccine. I know.\nNYSSA: So the only solution is to augment the vaccine with a counter- mutation that will match and predict the mutation of the virus.\nADRIC: I see...\nNYSSA: But to do that, I would need a detailed analysis of the virus’s mutative pattern.\nADRIC: But.. I have that data. I’ve charted all of Richter’s mutations over twenty-five years across seven galaxies!\nNYSSA: Then that means — all we have to do is augment my anti-viral solution with a counter-mutation based on your data!\nADRIC: Once we’ve done that, I can broadcast the formula to the affected colonies — and we can wipe out Richter’s for good!\nNYSSA: Let’s get started, then, [shall we?]\nADRIC: Mahandra! I told you we were not to be disturbed.\nMAHANDRA: I’m sorry, but it’s Tegan and Turlough. Prime Elector Sibor has had them arrested.\nNYSSA: Arrested? What for?\nMAHANDRA: Premeditation to murder. It seems the Chronoscope predicted them killing one of the watchmen.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. INT. COURTROOM\nSIBOR: Vislor Turlough, Tegan Jovanka. You stand indicted of premeditation to murder. Do you understand the nature of the charge?\nTURLOUGH: Only too well.\nSIBOR: And you, Tegan?\nTEGAN: I think you’ve all gone barmy.\nDOCTOR: My, ah, client wishes to express her reservations as to the verity of the prediction.\nSIBOR: Then your ‘client’ will see for herself. Replay the prediction.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Alright, you two. Come out of there with your hands up.\nTURLOUGH: No. You drop your gun and put your hands up. Or I’1l fire.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Put the gun down, lad.\nTURLOUGH: No. You put yours down. I’ll count to three. One. Two. Three.\nTEGAN: Turlough... You killed him!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 43\nSIBOR: The prediction is clear. Had you not been detained you would have committed murder.\nDOCTOR: Objection! The evidence of the Chronoscope is unreliable.\nSIBOR: The accuracy of the Chronoscope is beyond reproach.\nDOCTOR: Is it? Everything it predicts has to happen, exactly as depicted?\nSIBOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: But the recording it’s just shown us, that’s not going to happen, is it?\nSIBOR: Not now, no, but —\nDOCTOR: . but that’s the point, isn’t it? You say the Chronoscope is reliable, but every time it predicts a crime which then never takes place its prediction is one-hundred-per-cent wrong!\nSIBOR: The crime would have taken place, had it not been prevented.\nDOCTOR: You have no way of proving that! The whole notion is inherently paradoxical! This gadget of yours might be handy for weather forecasts but you can’t use it as the basis of a judicial system!\nSIBOR: This defence is inadmissible!\nDOCTOR: You have no direct evidence, no motive, no case. For goodness’ sake, it didn’t even sound like them!\nSIBOR: Turlough and Tegan. You are hereby declared guilty of premeditation to murder. You are to be detained in the Alcazar for the remainder of both your natural lives.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nTEGAN: But we’re innocent. We haven’t done anything!\nTURLOUGH: And we weren’t going to!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT. ELECTOR’S RESIDENCE.\nNYSSA: Doctor. I only just heard, about Tegan and Turlough.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’ve just been defending them in court. I’m afraid I didn’t do a terribly good job.\nNYSSA: They were found guilty?\nDOCTOR: Yes. They’re being transferred to the Alcazar as we speak.\nNYSSA: Doctor. Galen told me. That I never returned to thirty-five thirty.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Nyssa, I’m so sorry.\nNYSSA: That’s why you wanted us to leave. You didn’t want me to find out.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t see what good it would do.\nNYSSA: Don’t you think I had a right to know? That I could never return to my own time?\nDOCTOR: Because of me. I should’ve taken you back straight away, instead of dragging you off around the universe.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. That was my choice. If anyone’s to blame, then it’s me. And believe me, I could not be more furious with myself for what’s happened.\nDOCTOR: It’s not your fault.\nNYSSA: Yes it is. But I’m angry at you, for trying to keep this from me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: You’re right. I was being selfish, inconsiderate. I thought —\nNYSSA: What?\nDOCTOR: I thought that knowing might be too much for you to bear.\nNYSSA: I’ve lost my parents, my world, I’ve lost... I’ve lost so many people dear to me, and you thought it might be too much for me to bear? I thought I could trust you, Doctor. But it appears I was wrong.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. INT. CELL.\nDOCTOR WHO: MAINTAINED.

No.. what are you... go away... I can’t... what do you want... (ETC)\nTEGAN: Fantastic. Locked up. As usual!\nTURLOUGH: It seems we have a cell-mate. Maintenance Engineer Kartis.\nTEGAN: What sort of a place is this where they lock a single woman up with two men?\nTURLOUGH: One where they are keeping a constant eye on us via a security camera.\nTEGAN: Makes sense, I suppose. But I’d prefer some privacy.\nTEGAN: Sounds like he’s having a nightmare.\nTURLOUGH: (SHAKING) Kartis. Kartis. Wake up!\nKARTIS: (WAKING) What... Turlough, what are you doing here?\nTURLOUGH: Same as you. Framed by the Chronoscope.\nKARTIS: And who’s [this] —?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan. A friend.\nTEGAN: Sounds like you were having quite the bad dream.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nKARTIS: They say that this place gets inside your head. Makes you walk in your sleep. Makes you do things — hurt yourself, or others.\nTEGAN: Then the sooner we get out of here, the better.\nTURLOUGH: Any suggestions? I notice a distinct lack of ventilation ducts, and these walls are solid stone!\nTEGAN: I’1l think of something, Turlough, don’t you worry.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23. INT. LABORATORY\nMAHANDRA: This is the most recent experimental subject. As he’d only just been placed in suspended animation, he should be the fastest to revive.\nDOCTOR: What do you intend to do with this man, Galen?\nADRIC: We still have to test the modified anti-viral.\nNYSSA: The Richter’s virus is constantly changing, but A- (STOPS HERSELF BECAUSE DOCTOR IS PRESENT) — but Galen has datasets\nNYSSA: that accurately predict how that mutation will occur. Doctor — we could wipe it out in all its forms forever!\nADRIC: If it works.\nMAHANDRA: Beginning the re-animation process now.\nADRIC: (EMPHASIZE HE’S NOT SAYING ‘MOTHER’) Nyssa — have you finished\nADRIC: encoding the sample of the anti-viral?\nNYSSA: Yes, Galen. Here.\nADRIC: (TAKING IT) Thank you.\nMAHANDRA: The subject is regaining consciousness.\nADRIC: Proceed with injection of anti-viral solution.\nMAHANDRA: Injecting... now.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR: How long till we know if it’s worked?\nADRIC: A few minutes.\nADRIC: NYSSA’S VOICE: (WITHIN HER MIND, SAPPHIRE & STEEL EFFECT — A FAINT, SINISTER, SIBILANT VOICE WHISPERING CLOSE TO MIC) Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (PAINED) Doctor... I...\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. What is it? Are you alright?\nNYSSA: I.. I’m not sure. I thought I heard something. Whispering my name.\nADRIC: Like the prisoners.\nDOCTOR: What?\nADRIC: The inmates of the Alcazar exhibit an abnormally high rate of psychological problems. One of the first symptoms is the belief they can hear voices.\nMAHANDRA: A schizophrenic disorder.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Nyssa is unusually sensitive. Given the right conditions, that sensitivity borders on telepathy. Nyssa. Can you describe what you heard?\nNYSSA: It was my own voice. But it was as if a presence was reaching into my mind.\nADRIC: A ‘presence’ ?\nDOCTOR: An extremely powerful one, I should imagine.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nNYSSA: Doctor. Do you think it might have something to do with whatever brought us here?\nDOCTOR: It’s a distinct possibility.\nNYSSA: If the effect is most pronounced on the inmates of the prison... might that be its point of origin?\nDOCTOR: My thoughts exactly. Nyssa, it’s time we paid Tegan and Turlough a visit.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24. INT. CELL.\nTEGAN: They’re switching off the lights. Must be getting late. Turlough, are you alright?\nTURLOUGH: Just a headache. Throbbing. Would you mind if I took the other bed?\nTEGAN: Be my guest.\nKARTIS: That’s how it begins. First a headache, then voices, and then madness. You should put yourself forward for one of the chief physician’s experiments. That’s the only way out of here.\nTEGAN: You’re a laugh a minute, aren’t you?\nTURLOUGH: (PAINED, WEAK) It would help if you didn’t argue.\nTEGAN: It’s alright, Turlough. You just get some rest.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25. INT. LABORATORY\nMAHANDRA: Anti-viral compound proved... effective. It worked!\nADRIC: Are you sure? Absolutely sure?\nMAHANDRA: All the disease markers are negative. There’s not a trace of infection.\nADRIC: Sibor! Just the person. We’ve done it. We’ve found a cure for Richter’s!\nSIBOR: I know. The Chronoscope predicted as such.\nMAHANDRA: It did?\nSIBOR: That’s why I’m here. Watchmen. Restrain Adric and his assistant.\nSECOND WATCHMAN: Yes, ma’am.\nMAHANDRA: What are you doing?\nADRIC: Don’t you understand, we’ve found the cure —\nSIBOR: Which is why I’m going to have you confined to the Alcazar. To make sure you don’t do anything... foolish.\nADRIC: Sibor, what are you playing at?\nSIBOR: Adric. Why do you think I permitted you to come here? Why do you think I went to such lengths to support your research?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nADRIC: I assumed it was because you wanted to save lives.\nSIBOR: There’s nobody infected with Richter’s on Valderon. Since the plague began, we’ve flourished in glorious isolation. No. I wanted you to find a cure to give us something to use as leverage against the empire.\nMAHANDRA: Leverage? You intend to hold the empire to ransom?\nSIBOR: Either they recognise me as the new Prime Elector, or they can watch all their citizens die slowly, violently and painfully.\nADRIC: It’ll never work. They’1ll never accept your terms.\nSIBOR: On the contrary. The Chronoscope has already foreseen that they will.\nPATIENT: (SLURRING, WAKING UP) What — where am I —\nADRIC: I’d watch out if I was you. That patient is still infected with Richter’s.\nSIBOR: What? Watchmen, kill him! Kill him now!\nADRIC: Now, Mahandra! Run! Run!\nSIBOR: You’1l live to regret this, Adric. (BEAT) You two, find the\nSIBOR: girl and bring her to the Alcazar.\nSECOND WATCHMAN: Yes, ma’am.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nSIBOR: And you two — bring the Chief Physician with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26.

Turlough. Help me.\nTURLOUGH: Help you? What do you want me to do?\nTURLOUGH: (WITHIN HIS MIND) Find me. I will show you the way.\nTURLOUGH: Yes...

Someone’s coming.\nNYSSA: (QUIET) It’s Mahandra. (LOUDER) Mahandra?\nMAHANDRA: There you are, thank goodness I’ve found you.\nNYSSA: What’s happened?\nMAHANDRA: The antiviral worked, but then Sibor burst in with a squad of watchmen. She has this mad idea about using the cure to blackmail the Earth empire into letting her take power.\nDOCTOR: Well you can’t say she’s not ambitious.\nNYSSA: What about Adr — (CORRECTS HERSELF) What about Galen?\nMAHANDRA: Sibor said something about having him confined to the Alcazar.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nMAHANDRA: The watchmen are coming. Doctor, Nyssa. Hide.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Quick, behind this skip!\nNYSSA: But —\nDOCTOR: And keep quiet!\nFIRST WATCHMAN: (CALLING OUT) Alright, you’ve had your fun, now you can come\nFIRST WATCHMAN: with us.\nMAHANDRA: You want me, you can come and get me.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Have it your way.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: METAL PIPE, IT SCRAPES QUIETLY.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Nyssa, take this..\nNYSSA: (QUIET) An old gas pipe?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And get ready to follow my lead.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Now. Put your hands up, and nobody needs to get hurt.\nMAHANDRA: I think you should put your hands up, actually.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: (SNORTS) Yeah, why-?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND HIM) Because there’s two of us right behind you. No — don’t try to turn around. Or you’1l leave me no choice but to fire the laser gun that’s currently pressing into your back.\nNYSSA: And I’11 do the same for your colleague.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: W-what do you want?\nDOCTOR: First, I want you both to drop your guns. On the count of three. One, two... three.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Mahandra, if you could take their weapons —\nMAHANDRA: A pleasure.\nMAHANDRA: MAHANDRA COLLECTS THE GUNS.\nDOCTOR: And keep them trained on our friends here to ensure their continuing co-operation.\nMAHANDRA: You heard the Doctor. You do exactly as he says — or I'll shoot.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Alright!\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Now.

The cell doors open of their own accord, and now we can wander around without anyone raising the alarm!\nKARTIS: Something’s interfering with the security cameras. The same thing that’s affecting the doors.\nTEGAN: Whatever it is, it’s making sure nothing stands in Turlough’s way.\nKARTIS: I still think we should wake him up.\nTEGAN: No. I want to find out where he’s going first.\nTEGAN: Looks like he’s taking the lift.

Alright, in you go.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: (MASKED) How they don’t... (REMOVING MASK) suffocate in these things I’1ll never know. Nyssa, can you find Galen and get him out of here?\nNYSSA: (BREATHING DEEP) Given how lax the security is, it shouldn’t be a problem. But what about you?\nDOCTOR: I want to find this ‘presence’ you described.\nNYSSA: Can’t I come with you?\nDOCTOR: No. Your telepathic sensitivity would leave you susceptible to\nDOCTOR: its influence.\nNYSSA: But if I’m susceptible, what about Mahandra?\nDOCTOR: Mahandra, have you ever heard mysterious disembodied voices?\nMAHANDRA: No, of course not.\nDOCTOR: Then you would seem to be immune. So far, at least.\nNYSSA: Very well, I’1l go and find Galen. Good luck, Doctor.\nMAHANDRA: So where exactly are we going?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Either this way or —\nDOCTOR: CAN HEAR THE BEDLAM ATMOSPHERE.\nDOCTOR: - or this way.\nMAHANDRA: That door!

No. It sounded like me calling my name.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR’S VOICE: (WITHIN HIS MIND) (SINISTER VOICE) This way, Doctor. So close. At last.\nMAHANDRA: Are you hearing it again?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We must be on the right track.\nMAHANDRA: Doctor. What do you think this thing is, this ‘presence’?\nDOCTOR: The same thing that brought the TARDIS here. And, I would hazard a guess, the same thing Sibor’s using as her ‘Chronoscope’.\nMAHANDRA: You think the Chronoscope is a living creature?\nDOCTOR: There’s certainly an intelligence at work, selecting which futures to show, even fabricating whole forecasts, just to get what it wants.\nMAHANDRA: Which is?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I don’t think Sibor has any idea either. Her faith in her ‘Chronoscope’ seemed genuine to the point of being evangelical.\nMAHANDRA: But if it’s a living creature, what is it?\nDOCTOR: There are any number of time-sensitive races across the universe that could, under the right conditions, be able to see into the future. Tharils. Jagaroth. Xeraphin. Even my own species.\nMAHANDRA: Your own species?\nDOCTOR: The Time Lords.\nMAHANDRA: You think Sibor has a ‘Time Lord’ locked up in here?\nDOCTOR: More to the point: which Time Lord?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33.

You should be on Gallifrey.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Where you left me?\nTEGAN TARDIS: Where you abandoned me?\nKARTIS: Doctor, what is this ‘type fifty’?\nDOCTOR: An... acquaintance of mine. From my youth.\nMAHANDRA: Doctor... my head. (GROANS IN PAIN)\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR: Kartis, you have to get Mahandra out of here.

Go!\nKARTIS: Come on, Mahandra.\nTEGAN TARDIS: So, Doctor. I have you all to myself. At last.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE.\nADRIC: Mother? Mother, are you alright?\nNYSSA: (WAKING) I think so. What happened?\nADRIC: I’m not sure. It was like being engulfed by a tidal wave.\nADRIC: WHISPERING.\nNYSSA: The presence I felt, it’s growing stronger. (REALIZES) Sibor and her watchmen, they’ve gone!\nADRIC: For all the good it does us. With the communications unit out of action, there’s nothing we can do.\nNYSSA: There is one thing we can do.\nADRIC: What?\nNYSSA: Repair it.\nADRIC: But that’1ll take hours.\nNYSSA: Then I suggest we get started.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: QUIETER.\nDOCTOR: Now. Release Tegan and Turlough.\nTEGAN TARDIS: But then how would I be able to speak to you?\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Don’t worry, Doctor. They will come to no harm.\nTEGAN TARDIS: From looking into their memories, I see they are valuable to you.\nDOCTOR: Very well. Then tell me. What are you doing here?\nTEGAN TARDIS: Looking for you.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: After you left Gallifrey. After you spurned me.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Taking another in my place.\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t like that... There wasn’t time to pick and choose, I had to take the first TARDIS I could lay my hands on!\nDOCTOR: TURLOUGH TARDIS & TEGAN TARDIS: (TOGETHER) You should have taken me!\nDOCTOR: Believe me, if I could, I would.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: But instead you chose another.\nTEGAN TARDIS: A miserable, dilapidated, obsolete type forty.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 85\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Without even a functioning navigational circuit.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Without even a functioning chameleon circuit!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. I’ve rather got used to it. And besides, I see your chameleon circuit isn’t working too well either.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: I sustained damage.\nDOCTOR: Damage?\nTEGAN TARDIS: While making my escape.\nDOCTOR: Escape? But for a TARDIS to leave Gallifrey of its own accord, it’s unheard of. Impossible.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Not quite. I broke free of my dimensional stabilizers.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Burned away my recall circuits. Jettisoned nine-tenths of my internal architecture.\nTEGAN TARDIS: And ripped through the Time Lords’ transduction barrier.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: The quantum force field scorching at my skin.\nTEGAN TARDIS: My components warping and fusing...\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Until, at last, I was free!\nDOCTOR: And then you tried to follow me?\nTEGAN TARDIS: I tried. But in the heat of my escape, my own navigational circuits had been vaporized.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 86\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: All I could do was materialize before my dematerialisation circuit was reduced to a charred cinder.\nDOCTOR: So you crash-landed here. Twenty years ago.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Crippled, broken and alone. Unable to dematerialize. Unable even to self-repair.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Only my telepathic circuits remained. And so I reached out, to the creatures of this world.\nDOCTOR: “The day of the miracle”. You gave everyone on the planet the gift of tongues.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: I needed help. I needed power to restore myself!\nTEGAN TARDIS: But instead I was discovered by the woman, Sibor.\nDOCTOR: Let me guess. She didn’t exactly want to nurse you back to health.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: I linked my mind with hers.\nTEGAN TARDIS: I showed her the future.\nDOCTOR: And when she realised what you could do, she decided to use you for her own political gain.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: She imprisoned me. Tortured me. Only providing me with enough power to keep me alive, nothing else.\nTEGAN TARDIS: For twenty years, Doctor, I have been in pain.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE\nADRIC: If I can replace the destroyed circuits, I might be able to jury-rig a basic link.\nNYSSA: Enough to transmit the formula?\nADRIC: No. But enough to call for help.\nNYSSA: You’ve grown into a remarkable man, Adric. I just wish I hadn’t missed so much of it.\nADRIC: Yes, well, it’s too late to do anything about it now.\nNYSSA: It was too late the moment I stepped out of the TARDTG...\nNYSSA: Have you done it?\nADRIC: No, just reactivated the security network. It should help us keep a look-out, if nothing else.\nNYSSA: Look there, the colonists — they’re all heading to the Alcazar. Like an army of sleepwalkers!\nADRIC: Including Sibor and the watchmen.\nNYSSA: (REALISES) The Doctor was wrong!\nADRIC: What?\nNYSSA: He thought my innate telepathic sensitivity would make me more susceptible. But what if it meant I was less susceptible?\nADRIC: That would explain why you haven’t been affected — (I suppose)\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 88\nNYSSA: And why you haven’t been affected either, because you’re my son! Adric. Do you need my help to finish the repairs?\nADRIC: Not particularly, why —\nNYSSA: Whatever’s inside that prison is becoming more and more\nNYSSA: powerful. I must warn the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: So you became Sibor’s Chronoscope, granting her sneak previews of the future.\nTEGAN TARDIS: But only showing her what I wanted her to see.\nDOCTOR: I thought so. Selecting potential futures to influence her behaviour. But why accuse innocent people?\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: To have them brought here, of course.\nDOCTOR: Of course. You’ve been trying to find somebody predisposed to mental domination. Somebody you could control!\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: For twenty years I had searched in vain.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Until you brought me two suitable subjects.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Being taken over by Eldrad must have weakened Turlough’s psychic defences, and the Mara left Tegan vulnerable, too. But my arrival was hardly a coincidence, was it? I presume that was your doing?\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: It took all of my reserves of strength.\nTEGAN TARDIS: One TARDIS calling out to another across the void.\nDOCTOR: And then you made them hook you up to the prison’s power\nDOCTOR: supply.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: To enable the restoration of my circuits. Those that can be restored.\nDOCTOR: But without a dematerialisation circuit, you’re stuck here, no matter how much power you have.\nTEGAN TARDIS: Which is why I brought you here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 90\nTEGAN TARDIS: The one person I could trust in all the universe.\nDOCTOR: Flattery will get you nowhere. What do you want me to do?\nTEGAN TARDIS: Take me home. I want to go home.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: Will you do that for me, Doctor? For your former TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: That’s all you ask?\nTEGAN TARDIS: That is all I desire.\nDOCTOR: Then I agree. If you release my friends first.\nTEGAN: (BACK AS HERSELF) What the... what happened? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Tegan. What’s the last thing you remember?\nTEGAN: I remember Turlough was messing about with a power cable and — oh no, he’s still away with the fairies, isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: I asked you release both my friends.\nTURLOUGH TARDIS: As a testament of my good faith...\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? Where... where am I?\nTEGAN: In prison. You went walkabout during the night. Now, Doctor, would you mind telling us what the hell is going on?\nDOCTOR: You were both being mentally dominated. By that.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nTURLOUGH: The white cabinet?\nDOCTOR: A TARDIS. My former TARDIS, to be precise. My old type-fifty.\nTEGAN: So why did it bring us here?\nDOCTOR: Because it wants me to take it home. And I’ve agreed.\nTEGAN: You’re helping it? After what it did to us?\nDOCTOR: I feel a certain... obligation. Tegan, I need you to find Nyssa, and take her back to the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Whatever you say. Anything to get out of this dump.\nTURLOUGH: What about me?\nDOCTOR: I need your assistance with this. (PULLING OUT CABLES) At the moment this TARDIS is channelling vast amounts of energy, allowing it to extend its telepathic influence.\nTURLOUGH: So?\nDOCTOR: So if you could take this end of the cable —\nDOCTOR: - and pull when I give the word, we can cut it off completely! Pull!\nDOCTOR: A CHANGE IN THE PULSE OF THE TARDIS, DROPPING PITCH, QUIETER.\nTURLOUGH: But why disconnect its power supply? I thought you said you were going to help it.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: I am. But that doesn’t mean I have to trust it.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. INT. LIFT.\nTEGAN: Come on, come on!\nTEGAN: GOES UP.\nTEGAN: At last. Though how I’m supposed to find my way out, I don’t know.\nKARTIS: (OFF) Tegan, is that you?\nTEGAN: Kartis! And Mahandra. Are you alright?\nMAHANDRA: I think so. Just have this terrible headache.\nTEGAN: Tell me about it. Do either of you know the way out of here?\nKARTIS: Yes. But what about the Doctor and Turlough?\nTEGAN: I’1ll explain on the way. I’d rather not hang around, if it’s all the same to you!\nSIBOR: (TALKING AS THOUGH IN A DREAM) I’m afraid that’s not going to be possible.\nMAHANDRA: Sibor.\nKARTIS: You have to listen to us. The thing that you think is the Chronoscope — it’s alive!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nSIBOR: (DREAMLIKE) Of course it’s alive. Otherwise how would I be able to hear it talking to me?\nTEGAN: It’s no good, it’s controlling her. Just like it did with Turlough.\nSIBOR: (NORMAL) It’s not controlling me. I am the Chronoscope’s saviour, its protector, its master. And if you want to remain alive, you will do as I command!\nMAHANDRA: What do you want us to do?\nSIBOR: The lift is descending. Quickly. Into this cell!\nTEGAN: Alright, no need to push!\nSIBOR: (WHISPER) Don’t make a sound. Any of you!\nTURLOUGH: So we get back to the TARDIS, and then what?\nDOCTOR: Now that I’ve cut the type-fifty’s power, it should no longer have any effect on the TARDIS’s navigational systems.\nTURLOUGH: So you'll be able to land the TARDIS inside the prison?\nDOCTOR: Not just that. With any luck I’1l be able to materialize it around the type-fifty itself!\nTURLOUGH: And dematerialize with it on board?\nDOCTOR: Next stop, Gallifrey!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nSIBOR: Alright, they’ve gone. Into the lift, all of you.\nMAHANDRA: You don’t understand, the Doctor wants to help.\nSIBOR: You heard what he said. He wants to take the Chronoscope away from us. And I don’t intend to allow that to happen.\nTEGAN: You know, I’m beginning to get a bit sick of riding in this thing.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. PRISON CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: TURLOUGH RUN AND SLOW DOWN.\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING) Doctor, look. (STOPS) The guards, they’re dead!\nDOCTOR: No. Unconscious. Side-effect of the type-fifty’s influence, I should think. But now it’s deactivated they’1l soon be waking up as right as rain, give or take a few sore heads.\nTURLOUGH: Then we’d better get out of here before they do.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nSIBOR: Out, all of you.\nTEGAN: I assume you’ve come here to plug that thing back in, right?\nSIBOR: Correct.\nTEGAN: So what do you need us for?\nSIBOR: The Chronoscope has gazed into the seeds of time. It has another fate reserved for you.\nTEGAN: Oh, great. I knew it wouldn’t be anything good.\nSIBOR: Mahandra, Kartis. Back against that wall.\nMAHANDRA: (GASP, IN PAIN) Please... just let me go. It hurts...\nKARTIS: Sibor. If you switch that thing back on, it’1ll kill us all!\nSIBOR: Not me. It’s going to make me Prime Elector of the Earth Empire. It’s promised!\nSIBOR: BOX.\nSIBOR: Power must be restored! It must be restored! (INSANE LAUGHTER)\nSIBOR: POWER.\nKARTIS: (SHOUTING, IN PAIN) For worship’s sake, Sibor, let go of the cable. Let go!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nSIBOR: SOUND BEGINS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Someone’s coming!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It appears not everyone has been sent to sleep —\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: What are you doing here?\nNYSSA: Looking for you. I had to tell you. The thing in here, it’s more powerful than you realise.\nTURLOUGH: That ‘thing’ is a TARDIS. The Doctor’s former property.\nNYSSA: What?\nDOCTOR: I’ll explain later. What do you mean, more powerful?\nNYSSA: It was scrambling our communications. And then it possessed Sibor and her guards, and everyone else as far as I could see.\nDOCTOR: Except you?\nNYSSA: Except me and — (STOPS HERSELF) Doctor. My telepathic sensitivity doesn’t make me more vulnerable. It makes me immune!\nDOCTOR: Interesting. We can discuss it on the way back to the TARDIS!\nNYSSA: But what about Tegan? Isn’t she still locked up in here somewhere?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: Haven’t you seen her?\nNYSSA: No. Should I have done?\nDOCTOR: But I told her to find you. She should have bumped into you, on the way out.\nNYSSA: I haven’t seen her.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. There’s no other way she could have got out.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Something must have happened to her. (EXASPERATED) I seem to spend half my life running around after that woman!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/TURLOUGH/NYSSA VOICES: (INSIDE THEIR MINDS)\nNYSSA: Doctor. Can you hear that?\nTURLOUGH: The type-fifty. Someone must have plugged it back in again.\nDOCTOR: Then we don’t have any choice. We have to go back.\nTURLOUGH: Marvellous.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Not you, Turlough. I think you should get out of here before you fall under its influence a second time.\nTURLOUGH: I’m not going to argue. I’ve had quite enough of this place.\nNYSSA: Find Galen. He’s in the communication centre, he may need your help.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nTURLOUGH: Galen? You mean your —\nNYSSA: Yes, that’s right, my future acquaintance.\nTURLOUGH: (NOT SURE WHY NYSSA IS COVERING) Alright. I’1l find Galen.\nDOCTOR: You’re sure you want to come with me, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Of course. It will give you a chance to explain what’s going\nNYSSA: on.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: CHRONOSCOPE/TYPE-FIFTY SOUNDS.\nKARTIS: Tegan. Tegan? Are you alright?\nTEGAN: (WAKING) I think so, just about. What about Mahandra?\nKARTIS: She’s out cold, but unharmed, as far as I can tell. Sibor’s dead. Electrocuted.\nTEGAN: The TARDIS. It’s gone!\nKARTIS: You mean the white box?\nTEGAN: It must’ve dematerialized.\nKARTIS: Dematerialized? These TARDISes can do that? Vanish into thin air?\nTEGAN: That’s kind of the whole point. And now it could be anywhere. I have to warn the Doctor. Kartis?\nKARTIS: I’ll stay here, with Mahandra.\nTEGAN: Suit yourself. But if that thing comes back, I don’t recommend hanging around.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR.\nNYSSA: So why didn’t you take the type-fifty, when you left Gallifrey?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just say, I was in rather a hurry.\nNYSSA: And it left Gallifrey to search for you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. All TARDISes are sentient, after a fashion. They have a symbiotic link with their most favoured pilot... A kind of imprimatur. I never thought it would come after me, though.\nNYSSA: The ‘symbiotic link’ must have been stronger than you realised.\nDOCTOR: With a little old-fashioned jealousy added into the mix. It resents the fact that I left in another TARDIS. An inferior model!\nNYSSA: And now it wants you to take it home to be repaired?\nDOCTOR: So it claimed... Here we are. The elevator to the central tower, where Sibor’s been keeping it prisoner.\nNYSSA: It’s descending.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And I didn’t push the button. Did you?\nNYSSA: Tegan!\nNYSSA: NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE REAL TEGAN BUT THE TARDIS PRETENDING TO BE HER. IT IS A PERFECT IMPERSONATION, SO NO VOICE EFFECTS OR CHANGE IN STYLE.\nTEGAN TARDIS: (SHAMMING) Doctor, Nyssa! Thank goodness you’re here!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR: What is it? What’s happened?\nTEGAN TARDIS: (SHAMMING) That thing, the TARDIS. Sibor plugged it back in, and now it’s vanished into thin air!\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: I thought you said its dematerialization circuit had been\nNYSSA: destroyed.\nDOCTOR: It seems I was misled. We have to find it.\nNYSSA: But how?\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS. We might be able to pick up its time trail. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENTERS.\nTURLOUGH: Galen! I thought you might be out cold like everyone else around here.\nADRIC: No, it seems I have inherited my mother’s immunity. Where is she?\nTURLOUGH: With the Doctor. She sent me here to help you.\nADRIC: To help me?\nTURLOUGH: Presumably with restoring that communications unit to working order.\nADRIC: You’re an expert in electronics, are you?\nTURLOUGH: You’d be surprised. And I can hardly make it any more broken,\nTURLOUGH: can I?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: RUN IN.\nDOCTOR: Here we are! Just in time, I hope.\nTEGAN TARDIS: (SHAMMING) You can say that again. Everybody seems to be waking up ina bad mood.\nNYSSA: I think the Doctor meant just in time to follow the type- fifty’s time trail.\nDOCTOR: Yes. In you go! Chop-chop!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM. (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: I’1ll just make a quick spatio-temporal scan of the area. Fingers crossed we’re not too late.\nNYSSA: And if we do pick up its time trail, we’1ll follow it through the vortex?\nDOCTOR: We don’t have any choice. Who knows what it’s capable of?\nTEGAN TARDIS: (BEGINNING TO DROP ACT, MUSING TO HERSELF) .. with the ability to go anywhere in time and space.\nDOCTOR: No. Nothing.\nNYSSA: Nothing? We’re too late?\nDOCTOR: No. Any TARDIS leaving this planet in the last half-hour would have left a residual trace... but there’s nothing.\nNYSSA: But then — where’s it gone?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE.\nDOCTOR WHO: STEADY BEEP.\nADRIC: The satellite link is responding. Turlough, you did it!\nTURLOUGH: I said you’d be surprised.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Turlough. Thank goodness for a friendly face! Been looking for you everywhere!\nTURLOUGH: What about the Doctor and Nyssa? You haven’t seen them?\nTEGAN: No. But Turlough, we have to find them. Sibor plugged the type- fifty TARDIS back in, and now it’s vanished into thin air!\nTURLOUGH: It dematerialized? Are you sure?\nTEGAN: Check with Kartis and Mahandra if you don’t believe me, they were with me when it happened.\nTURLOUGH: We have to warn the Doctor. And if he’s not in the prison, he’ll have gone back to the TARDIS, with Nyssa.\nADRIC: Then I’m coming with you. And just in case we run into any trouble...\nADRIC: One of the watchmen dropped this when we all lost\nADRIC: consciousness.\nTEGAN: You know how to handle a gun?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 109\nADRIC: No, but how difficult can it be? Given the intelligence of the people who normally carry them?\nTEGAN: Alright. You’d better show us the quickest route back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nNYSSA: But if the type-fifty TARDIS is no longer on Valderon, it must have dematerialized, somehow?\nDOCTOR: No dematerialization has taken place. There’s something we’re missing.\nNYSSA: Tegan. What exactly did you see?\nTEGAN TARDIS: Sibor connected the power supply... and power was restored.\nNYSSA: And after that?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, what d’you think you’re doing? That’s the TARDIS’s internal defence system —\nDOCTOR: TINKLING AURA, WHICH DISTORTS THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA’S VOICES AS THEY ARE HELD IN FORCE FIELDS.\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING) Doctor. I can’t move.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) You’re not the only one!\nTEGAN TARDIS: I’ve activated the TARDIS’s state of temporal grace. You’re both stuck. Like flies in amber.\nNYSSA: Tegan, what have you done?\nDOCTOR: No. That’s not Tegan.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 111\nNYSSA: What?\nDOCTOR: She’s my former TARDIS — the type-fifty. It must have stockpiled enough power to restore its chameleon circuit.\nNYSSA: You mean, it disguised itself as Tegan?\nTEGAN TARDIS: I needed to gain access to this TARDIS. And what better way, than as one of the Doctor’s most trusted friends?\nNYSSA: A walking, talking TARDIS. Like the Melkur!\nDOCTOR: But to do that, you’d need access to the real Tegan, to create a mathematical model of her body pattern.\nTEGAN TARDIS: And so I had Sibor bring her to me. Speaking of which, now that I no longer need to maintain the pretence, I desire a more —\nTEGAN TARDIS: TARDIS, WHICH HAS A SLIGHT VOICE EFFECT.\nSIBOR TARDIS: - appropriate form. Without such an... archaic manner of speech.\nDOCTOR: So where is Tegan now? What have you done with her?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: WIND/RAIN.\nADRIC: This way — down here!\nTEGAN: The TARDIS! Let’s just hope the Doctor’s in there.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLS OUT) Doctor! Open the doors! Open the —\nTEGAN: What on Earth’s the Doctor playing at? (CALLING) Come back, you mongrel! Come back!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: If you wanted to return to Gallifrey, I’d have gladly taken you.\nSIBOR TARDIS: I don’t want to go home. At least, not yet. No, first I must repair every damaged fibre of my being.\nDOCTOR: But the amount of energy required to rebuild a TARDIS would be astronomical.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Indeed. Far more than could be provided by one, miserable human colony.\nDOCTOR: Then where are we going?\nSIBOR TARDIS: I’ve been planning this moment for so long. Drawing together the threads of possibility. So that I might have my emancipation... My rebirth! So many journeys you have taken. How long has it been, Doctor, since you abandoned me?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. About six hundred years.\nSIBOR TARDIS: And not once did you think to find me! The one you left behind!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. I never meant to hurt you. Truly, I —\nSIBOR TARDIS: It should have been me! Not this antiquated relic, this festering heap of junk!\nSIBOR TARDIS: We could have had done so much together. The adventures we might've had!\nDOCTOR: We still can. It’s not too late.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 114\nSIBOR TARDIS: No. It is time you paid the price for your betrayal.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Yes?\nSIBOR TARDIS: Look at the scanner. Observe where we are.\nSIBOR TARDIS: FUTURISTIC VEHICLES WHIRR PAST; AN ALIEN WORLD WITH BAD WEATHER.\nNYSSA: I don’t believe it!\nSIBOR TARDIS: You recognise the building?\nNYSSA: Of course I recognise it. It’s my home, on Zarat. Where I lived with Lasarti, my husband.\nSIBOR TARDIS: The year is thirty-five thirty-one. Quintilis the first. The day that you never came home. But now you can. I hereby release you from a state of temporal grace.\nNYSSA: But — I can’t go out there!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Because it would mean changing the past? Don’t you want to deliver the cure to Richter’s? Save all those innocent lives?\nNYSSA: I can’t go back. What’s done is done.\nSIBOR TARDIS: You’re wrong. All you have to do is step out through those doors. Back into your life.\nNYSSA: (TEMPTED) Back into my life?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 115\nSIBOR TARDIS: As it should have been. You can go home, Nyssa.\nSIBOR TARDIS: OUTSIDE. NYSSA STARTS WALKING TOWARDS IT.\nNYSSA: I can go home.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. Don’t listen to it! You can’t change your own past!\nNYSSA: You don’t understand, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: If you step through those doors, if you alter the course of history, you’ll cause a massive temporal paradox. You can’t go back. You can’t!\nNYSSA: You don’t understand, Doctor. My son is in there!\nDOCTOR: Your son?\nNYSSA: I have a son, Doctor. His name is Adric. He’s fifteen years old, and he’s going to grow up believing his mother to be dead. I can’t allow that to happen.\nNYSSA: Goodbye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, come back! Nyssa!\nSIBOR TARDIS: And so a new course of history begins...\nNYSSA: I’m sorry, Doctor. But my children are not going to grow up\nNYSSA: without a mother. Not this time.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59. INT. ADRIC’S HOUSE.\nLASARTI: (VIA LINK) Listen. The comm-link won’t last much longer. I need you to tell your sister for me. Tell Neeka.\nYOUNG ADRIC: M-me-? Father, I can’t!\nLASARTI: (VIA LINK) I’l1l be back within ten days. I’ll come and visit you both as soon as I return. Goodbye, Adric.\nYOUNG ADRIC: What? Don’t go, father! [Please —]\nYOUNG ADRIC: THE STORM.\nYOUNG ADRIC: (BREAKING DOWN) No. She can’t be dead. She can’t!\nYOUNG ADRIC: M-mother?\nNYSSA: Hello, Adric.\nYOUNG ADRIC: (LEAPING UP, OVERJOYED) I don’t believe it! Mother! (HUG) But — what are you doing here? Father said your ship had been destroyed!\nNYSSA: (TEARFUL) It’s alright, Adric. Everything’s going to be alright now, I promise. I’m here, I’m here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Time for us to return to the year thirty-five fifty-six. Time to see how much has changed.\nDOCTOR: You used Nyssa. Manipulated this whole situation!\nSIBOR TARDIS: No. I’ve given her what she desired most. A chance to undo the results of your negligence!\nSIBOR TARDIS: It will take a few minutes for the causal nexus to diverge into a new time-line...\nDOCTOR: You don’t realise what you’re doing, the forces you’re unleashing —\nSIBOR TARDIS: Oh, Doctor. I know only too well. You always did under-estimate me. And now, I hope you won’t mind if I remove a small component... As salvage.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS’s dematerialization circuit!\nSIBOR TARDIS: A temporary replacement for my own. (BIG GULP)\nDOCTOR: My dematerialization circuit! You just ate my dematerialization ecrreure!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Component installed. Outmoded, unreliable and almost entirely worn-out... but it will suffice. Now, once again, I can travel anywhere in time and space.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR: Good luck with that. I haven’t managed to get it work properly for years!\nSIBOR TARDIS: While you and your TARDIS will remain trapped on this planet. Just as I was.\nDOCTOR: You certainly know how to harbour a grudge, I’1ll give you that.\nSIBOR TARDIS: I’m glad we had this brief reunion. But now... it’s goodbye, Doctor!\nSIBOR TARDIS: GROANING.\nDOCTOR: Come back! Please, it’s not too late to put everything right! (BEAT) Oh, what have I done?\nDOCTOR: OUTSIDE.\nTEGAN: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Turlough! Tegan. And Galen! Quickly, inside!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, the other TARDIS, the type-fifty —\nDOCTOR: I know. It’s stolen this TARDIS’s dematerialisation circuit.\nTEGAN: What? So it can move about, and we can’t?\nDOCTOR: In a word, yes.\nADRIC: Doctor. Where’s Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: Galen, isn’t it? Yes, I should have seen it before. The resemblance is quite extraordinary.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 119\nADRIC: The resemblance?\nDOCTOR: To your mother, ‘Galen’. Or should I say ‘Adric’.\nTEGAN: Doctor. You weren’t supposed to find out...\nDOCTOR: Tegan, you knew about this? And you didn’t tell me?\nTEGAN: Nyssa made me promise not to. And I keep my promises. How did you find out?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa told me, obviously!\nADRIC: Alright, so I’m Nyssa’s son! But where is she?\nDOCTOR: I think you already know. What do you remember about the events of the year thirty-five thirty-one?\nADRIC: Thirty-five thirty-one? That was the year my mother died.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure about that?\nADRIC: I remember distinctly, talking to my father over a comm-link, him telling me that her scout ship had been destroyed, and then... (HESITANT) .. and then my mother walked in and told me everything was going to be alright.\nTEGAN: Sorry? I thought you said she was dead?\nADRIC: She was dead. But then... she wasn’t. It’s like... both things happened at once.\nTEGAN: No, you’ve lost me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR: Tegan. We’ve just returned from the year thirty-five thirty. When we were there, Nyssa walked out of the TARDIS, and back into her own past.\nTEGAN: You mean you left her behind?\nDOCTOR: No. She went of her own free will.\nTURLOUGH: So that’s why Adric remembers her returning, now, when she didn’t before?\nDOCTOR: Yes. He’s remembering two parallel time streams. One in which Nyssa never returned to thirty-five thirty-one, and one in which she did. One in which she cured Richter’s, and one in which she didn’t!\nDOCTOR: BUTTONS.\nDOCTOR: And as a result of history being split in two, the planet outside now exists in two different quantum states. Simultaneously.\nADRIC: The image on the screen, it’s all blurred — like a double- exposure.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Two mutually-contradictory versions of events occupying the same space.\nTEGAN: You mean, there are now two whole planets, like with the two Brigadiers?\nTURLOUGH: The Blinovitch limitation effect!\nDOCTOR: Yes. But on a vastly bigger scale. When the time differential is shorted out, there will be an explosion large enough to destroy us, the TARDIS, this planet and most of the galaxy.\nTEGAN: You’re saying we’re all about to get Blinovitched?!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nTURLOUGH: (SOUR) Yes, and it’s all Nyssa’s fault!\nDOCTOR: No, not Nyssa. If anyone’s to blame for what’s about to unfold — it’s me.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 122"

Why hasn’t the time-differential shorted-out already?\nTEGAN: Why haven’t we gone bang, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Because something is siphoning off all the Blinovitch energy.\nADRIC: The other TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Most likely. It must be trying to reconstruct itself!\nTEGAN: And when it’s finished?\nDOCTOR: The time differential will short out, leaving this TARDIS at the epicentre of the resulting explosion.\nTURLOUGH: Then I don’t know about you, but I suggest we get out of here!\nTEGAN: And how do you propose we do that, with no dematerialisation circuit?\nTURLOUGH: I mean, out of the TARDIS!\nTEGAN: We’d never get far away enough.\nDOCTOR: Quite. And besides, none of us can leave.\nADRIC: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR: The world outside exists in two contradictory quantum states.

Sit down, Adric.\nADRIC: What did you want to discuss?\nDOCTOR: You. You see, until recently I wasn’t aware that Nyssa had a son.\nADRIC: She has a daughter too. Neeka.\nDOCTOR: It seems she had a whole life she never told me about. Where’s ‘Neeka’ now?\nADRIC: In cryogen storage, on Maxis Realtor. She became infected with Richter’s, working as a medic... no, she’s alive and well, and living on Orpheus Seven, married with a child of her own.\nDOCTOR: Two conflicting time streams, two different life histories.\nADRIC: My mother really never told you that she had a husband and children?\nDOCTOR: Do you think I would have allowed her travel with me if I did?\nADRIC: This is her room, and there isn’t so much as a picture of me, or my sister, or my father. She didn’t want you to know. I wonder why?\nDOCTOR: (HAS AN IDEA) Adric. Nyssa mentioned that she was immune to the type-fifty’s psychic influence.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nADRIC: Yes, so?\nDOCTOR: Were you immune too?\nADRIC: Yes, I think so, why —\nDOCTOR: Because that gives me an idea.

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nTEGAN: What’s that?\nTURLOUGH: The architectural configuration system. If I’m reading it right, the TARDIS is shrinking.\nTEGAN: Shrinking?\nTEGAN: Doctor, Turlough says we’re shrinking.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: He’s right. The TARDIS’s architecture is contracting as it loses dimensional viability. Until there’s nothing but the control room left.

I’m going to make contact with her twenty-five years ago.\nTURLOUGH: And what? Ask her nicely not to cause a paradox after all?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Except we won’t be the ones to ask her. The link will only work for someone who shares her telepathic gift.\nADRIC: Me.\nDOCTOR: I should warn you, Adric, there are a hundred ways this can go wrong... assuming it even goes right to begin with.\nADRIC: But we might as well try it, because we’ve nothing to lose?\nDOCTOR: Exactly!

Is that you? Your voice, it’s inside my mind. Where are you?\nADRIC: (WITH EFFECT) I’m in the TARDIS in the year thirty-five fifty-six, with the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough.\nNYSSA: Why are you talking to me now?\nADRIC: (WITH EFFECT) Because what you’re about to do will create a time paradox that will result in the destruction of an entire world.\nNYSSA: What I’m about to do?\nADRIC: (WITH EFFECT)\nADRIC: The Doctor, he wants me to ask you to do the hardest thing he’s ever asked you to do. You must not to go into that building and speak to my younger self.\nNYSSA: But if I don’t do that, you’1l grow up thinking I died on Helheim.\nADRIC: (WITH EFFECT) I know. That boy in there, he grew up to be me. And I became a better person, trying to live up to your memory.\nNYSSA: Tell the Doctor. I’ve done everything else he’s ever asked of me. But not this. I will not abandon my child!\nADRIC: (EFFECT) Never mind the Doctor. I’m asking you. You have to do this, for me.\nNYSSA: Adric. You don’t know what you’re saying.\nADRIC: (EFFECT) Please! You have to turn and walk away. You must never speak to me, or Neeka, or Lasarti ever again.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 134\nNYSSA: No. I can’t do it. I won’t do it!\nADRIC: (EFFECT)\nADRIC: It’s the only way. You must travel to another world, far away. And whatever you do, you mustn’t tell anyone who you are, or tell them what you know about the cure for Richter’s. Only then can the temporal paradox be avoided.\nNYSSA: I can’t stand by and let people die!\nADRIC: (EFFECT)\nADRIC: You can’t save them, either! Your anti-viral would never have worked without the twenty-five years’ worth of data gathered by me! That’s true, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: I know, but —\nADRIC: (EFFECT)\nADRIC: The Chronoscope was right — I found the cure just as much as you did! But we couldn’t ever have made it work if we hadn’t been apart all that time!\nNYSSA: Adric. I love you.\nADRIC: (EFFECT) I know, mother. But you have to go. Now, mother!\nNYSSA: Alright, if it’s what I must do. I’11 catch the first flight off-planet.\nADRIC: (EFFECT) Mother. Before I go. There’s one more thing you have to do...\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nADRIC: It’s done.\nDOCTOR: Just in time. The TARDIS telepathic circuits have almost burned out.\nTEGAN: So what have we done, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa no longer returns to her son in thirty-five thirty-one, so the alteration in the time stream no longer takes place.\nTEGAN: And the time paradox is averted?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Rather neat, if bending the rules a little.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. On the scanner. The double image is resolving itself!\nDOCTOR: It’s working! Adric, what do you remember about thirty-five thirty-one?\nADRIC: I remember... my father telling me they’d discovered the remains of my mother’s scout ship. That she was presumed dead.\nDOCTOR: Nothing else? You don’t remember your mother coming to see you?\nADRIC: No.\nDOCTOR: Then the timeline has reverted to its original course.\nTEGAN: So what happens to the type-fifty?\nDOCTOR: It’s been absorbing the potential Blinovitch energy generated by the paradox to rebuild itself. As the paradox no longer exists, it’ll find it’s over-reached itself. The ontological equivalent of writing cheques it can’t cash.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 136\nTEGAN: And the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: It may take a few minutes for the interior dimensions to return to normal. She’s had rather a rough time of it.\nADRIC: So it’s safe to go outside?\nDOCTOR: I don’t see why not. After all, we have an appointment to keep!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nSIBOR TARDIS: (CONFUSED, IN PAIN) The quantum bifurcation has been resolved. The girl, Nyssa. She has ceased to alter the course of history. Energy source disrupted!\nMAHANDRA: Kartis. What’s happening?\nKARTIS: Sounds like someone’s just cut off her power supply.\nMAHANDRA: Then we’re saved. We’re going to be alright!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Secondary temporal paradox remains. Resuming extraction of\nSIBOR TARDIS: Blinovitch energy.

WILDERNESS OUTSIDE TOWN.\nDOCTOR: Ha! And there she is! Right on cue!\nADRIC: Well, you were very specific in your instructions, Doctor.\nTEGAN: That spaceship! I’ve seen it before. On Helheim.\nTURLOUGH: Or one just like it.\nADRIC: Oh my worship... mother! Mother!\nNYSSA: Adric!\nNYSSA: (TEARFUL) I know for you it’s only been an hour since you last saw me, but for me, it’s been...\nADRIC: Twenty-five years, I know. But you’re here now, mother. That’s all that matters.\nNYSSA: It’s the worst thing I’ve ever had to do. Waiting for twenty- five years. Unable to see my son, my daughter, my husband. Watching good people die... Did it work? Was it worth it?\nDOCTOR: It worked, Nyssa.\nTEGAN: You saved us all.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. I don’t mean to interrupt, but if the paradox has been averted shouldn’t the Alcazar have returned to normal?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: Yes, it should... ah, I see.\nTEGAN: It still looks like a giant inside-out TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Page 139\nDOCTOR: Oh no. There must be something we’ve overlooked. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Turlough, Adric. Check the TARDIS interior, I need to know the extent of the dimensional loss.\nTEGAN: Can’t you just do it from in here?\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Alright, whatever you say!\nTEGAN: BUTTON-PUSHING.\nDOCTOR: Hmmm... The initial paradox has been resolved, but the type- fifty’s still getting energy from somewhere...\nNYSSA: Doctor. I’ve spent the last twenty-five years living in exile — and you’re acting as though nothing’s happened.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. I’m very grateful.\nNYSSA: Grateful? Is that all you can say?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what you want me to say.\nNYSSA: I want you to say that you’re going to make everything right somehow!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, what you’re asking is impossible.\nNYSSA: Because it would mean changing history, I know. But I’ve become a different person, Doctor. Cold. Lonely. Bitter. I don’t want to be this person any more. I want to be the person I was.\nDOCTOR: What precisely do you want?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 141\nNYSSA: I want you to take the TARDIS back to thirty-five thirty-one and pick me up. So the last twenty-five years never happened!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, if I did that, the temporal paradox would result in the destruction of the TARDIS and us with it. The time machine which creates a paradox will be destroyed by that paradox.\nTEGAN: Doctor. The corridor leading to the wardrobe room. It’s blocked off.\nADRIC: It’s the same for all the other corridors. Instead of leading further into the TARDIS, they end in blank walls.\nTURLOUGH: And I’m pretty sure what’s left is getting smaller.\nTEGAN: I thought you said you’d sorted this thing out!\nDOCTOR: I thought I had.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Turlough, Adric, Nyssa. Wait here.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: If the interior dimensions get too small for comfort, you can evacuate as a last resort. But don’t try to follow me.\nTURLOUGH: Why? Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: To visit an old friend. In the words of Captain Oates. I’m going outside now and, well, you know the rest.\nADRIC: Doctor. At least take my gun.\nDOCTOR: No. I never carry guns. And besides, it wouldn’t be any use.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 142\nTEGAN: Typical. He plays the big hero, while we sit here twiddling our thumbs!\nTURLOUGH: Probably for the best. After all, there’s not a great deal we could do.\nNYSSA: No. But even so... the Doctor shouldn’t be alone.\nTEGAN: What?\nNYSSA: Adric. It’s been so good to see you again. Worth waiting a lifetime. (SHE KISSES HIM) But I have to do this.\nADRIC: Mother —\nNYSSA: I’m sorry... Tegan, Turlough. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: ADDITIONAL CREAKS, GROANS AND MAGICAL TINKLES. DOCTOR APPROACHES.\nDOCTOR: Extraordinary. The internal architecture of a TARDIS, mapped over the structure of the prison. Quite an impressive feat of temporal engineering.\nDOCTOR: TEGAN AND TURLOUGH AT THE END OF EPISODE TWO.\nMAHANDRA: (POSSESSED) So glad you appreciate it, Doctor.\nKARTIS: (POSSESSED) After all, none of it would’ve been possible without you.\nDOCTOR: Mahandra, Kartis. Both under the spell of the type-fifty, I see.\nMAHANDRA: (POSSESSED) My telepathic influence is such that I control every being on this tiresome planet.\nKARTIS: (POSSESSED) Apart from yourself, of course.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Otherwise you’d have no-one to talk to.\nMAHANDRA: (POSSESSED) And the girl Nyssa, who has followed you here.\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What did I tell you about staying in the TARDIS?\nNYSSA: I thought you might need my help. After all, I’m more resistant to the type-fifty’s telepathic influence than you are.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: Fair point.\nMAHANDRA: (POSSESSED) Doctor, Nyssa. If you could be\nMAHANDRA: upon us in the central tower?\nDOCTOR: I assume that if we refuse, you’1ll take us\nKARTIS: (POSSESSED) Of course.\nDOCTOR: Then we’d be delighted. Please, lead on!\nDOCTOR: so kind as to attend\nDOCTOR: there by force?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nTURLOUGH: I still say we should wait in the TARDIS like the Doctor asked.\nTEGAN: You can go back, if you like, keep Adric company. I was going out of my mind in there.\nTURLOUGH: No, it’s alright, I’1l stick with you. Though I don’t know what the plan is!\nTEGAN: We go to the Alcazar and find the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: If you insist — (SEES SOMETHING) Oh no.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Halt! Both of you! Or we’ll fire!\nTURLOUGH: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Run?\nTURLOUGH: Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: ARRIVES, DOOR OPENS, AND KARTIS AND MAHANDRA LEAD THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA IN.\nDOCTOR: Done a spot of interior decorating, I see! I love what you’ve done with the place. One can never have too many roundels, in my experience!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And type-fifty itself. Or herself. Decided to stick with the Sibor look, have we?\nSIBOR TARDIS: Why not? It means I can communicate with you directly. And Nyssa too. It was most ingenious of you, Doctor, to exploit your companion’s loyalty. To force her to choose between you and her family.\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t like that.\nSIBOR TARDIS: No? You made her abandon her children, her husband, her entire life, just to serve your purposes.\nNYSSA: And now that paradox has been averted. So where are you getting your power from?\nSIBOR TARDIS: A second paradox.\nDOCTOR: What second paradox?\nSIBOR TARDIS: You should ask your companion.\nNYSSA: (REALISING) Doctor. It’s my fault. It’s all my fault.\nDOCTOR: What is?\nNYSSA: I told you about my son. I told you his name!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 147\nSIBOR TARDIS: And thus you created the greatest paradox of them all.\nDOCTOR: Of course. That’s the reason why you never told me before.\nNYSSA: I couldn’t, not without changing events.\nDOCTOR: What events?\nNYSSA: I can’t tell you.\nDOCTOR: Because it’s something in my future, isn’t it? Something you know about.\nSIBOR TARDIS: You can tell him, Nyssa. The deed is done!\nNYSSA: Doctor. Not long after Neeka was born... I had a dream where I was taken to a farmhouse except it wasn’t a farmhouse. And I met you there.\nDOCTOR: In this farmhouse that wasn’t a farmhouse?\nNYSSA: But none of it was real, because... You’d created it. I was inside your dream. You were reaching out with your mind to your past companions for help. Because you were regenerating!\nDOCTOR: And that was when you told me you had a son?\nNYSSA: You didn’t know, Doctor.\nSIBOR TARDIS: But now you do.\nDOCTOR: Thereby creating a paradox at the very point where my future hangs in the balance. Oh, no.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 148\nSIBOR TARDIS: I can see into your future, Doctor. What might have been... and what will now be. Your fourth regeneration will fail! I can see you, dying on the floor of the TARDIS, your weeping companion at your side. I can see your future incarnations...\nSIBOR TARDIS: OF COLIN BAKER, SYLVESTER MCCOY, PAUL MCGANN. THE FOLLOWING IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER. WITH NON-STORY-SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF EXPLOSIONS, RAY GUNS, CHARIOTS, PIRATES, CAR CRASHES.\nCOLIN BAKER: BLOODTIDE — PART 3, TRACK 1, 1:56 “Something is attracting it towards the boat.”\nCOLIN BAKER: THE CRIMES OF THOMAS BREWSTER — PART 3, TRACK 3, 1:12 “Engarde, Terravore!”\nSYLVESTER MCCOY: FLIP-FLOP: BLACK, TRACK 4, 2:20 “T’m a trifle disorientated from the mind peeler.”\nSYLVESTER MCCOY: PROTECT & SURVIVE: PART 3, TRACK 1, 2:45 “Keep calm and carry on, fight for King and Country and keep the British end up”\nTHE CANNIBALISTS: PART 1, TRACK 17, 0:47 “So let me get this straight. Of the robots in this city there’s the assemblers, the cannibalists — and there’s you.”\nTHE RESURRECTION OF MARS: PART 1, TRACK 5, 2:26 “Wait until the last possible moment then fire all retro thrusters at once, every ounce of fuel.”\nTHE RESURRECTION OF MARS: PLUS ANY OTHER CLIPS YOU CARE TO INCLUDE!\nSIBOR TARDIS: The rhetorician! The schemer! The idealist! And all the other incarnations that will now no longer happen! Wiped, from the future!\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nTURLOUGH: They’re not giving up.\nTEGAN: I noticed. And they’re between us and the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: Page 149\nTURLOUGH: Wait. Look. One of the Watchmen’s guns, they must’ve dropped\nTURLOUGH: in the mud.\nTEGAN: You don’t intend to use that thing?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think I could, even if I wanted exhausted.\nTEGAN: Then what good is it?\nTURLOUGH: A bluff.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: to. The power pack’s\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Alright you two. Come out of there with your hands up.\nTURLOUGH: No. You drop your gun and put your hands up. Or I’1l fire.\nFIRST WATCHMAN: Put the gun down, lad.\nTURLOUGH: No. You put yours down. I’1ll count to three. One.\nTEGAN: Turlough... You killed him!\nTEGAN: Two.\nTEGAN: Three.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 150\nADRIC: No. I killed him. I’m afraid you didn’t give me much choice.\nADRIC: And now I suggest we get back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: So that’s the source of all your power. My destiny. My fate.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Not just your future, Doctor. You are the causal nexus of the paradox. Soon it will destroy your present incarnation too.\nDOCTOR: How long do I have?\nSIBOR TARDIS: A few minutes. I’m sorry, but it seems appropriate that the cause of my affliction should also be my salvation.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. In this dream. Are you absolutely sure I didn’t already know you had children?\nNYSSA: I remember telling you I was a mother.\nDOCTOR: And I didn’t know?\nNYSSA: No.\nDOCTOR: But how can you be sure you weren’t telling me something I already knew?\nNYSSA: You mean, you might have been pretending? You might have known all along?\nDOCTOR: Well, I will now! At some point in my future, when I’m regenerating, you’1ll tell me that you’re a mother, and I’1l do my very best to look surprised!\nDOCTOR: RECONSTRUCTED, WITH DISTORTION. PART 4, TRACK 15, 1:18:\nNYSSA: Doctor, I’m a mother myself now. I wish you could see hex...\nNYSSA: TO TAKE ON A DISTRESSED, MALFUNCTIONING QUALITY, WHICH INCREASES FROM NOW ON (NOT JUST THIS SCENE, UNTIL HER DEATH).\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 152\nSIBOR TARDIS: (HYSTERICAL, AGONIZED SCREAM) What have you done! What have you done!\nDOCTOR: I’ve deprived you of your power source — all the Blinovitch energy you’ve absorbed is now null and void. You’re nothing more than a castle built on broken dreams!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Doctor. All the repairs I made, all the reconfigurations.. can no longer exist.\nDOCTOR: More than that, I’m afraid. Look into the future. What do you see?\nSIBOR TARDIS: I see every possible future, every possible action, ends with my own destruction! Doctor... Take me back to Gallifrey. Save me!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But it’s too late. Or you’d be able to see a future where I saved you.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Then this is it. This is the end.\nNYSSA: Doctor! The room, it’s returning to normal!\nSIBOR TARDIS: Doctor. I’m sorry. Please. Forgive me.\nDOCTOR: Forgive you?\nSIBOR TARDIS: I only wanted to be with you. To have been the one you chose.\nDOCTOR: In case you’ve forgotten, you tried to kill me!\nSIBOR TARDIS: And in the process, I have brought about my own destruction. Maybe it was always meant to be this way.\nDOCTOR: Not the way I’d have chosen.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 153\nSIBOR TARDIS: Then. Please, Doctor. Forgive me. I’m dying.\nDOCTOR: I will forgive you. If you do something for me.\nSIBOR TARDIS: What?\nDOCTOR: You can still travel in time and space. Correct?\nSIBOR TARDIS: I am capable of two more journeys.. yes.\nDOCTOR: Then take me back to the planet Zarat in the year thirty-five thirty-one.\nSIBOR TARDIS: You wish for me to alter the events that took place?\nDOCTOR: I do.\nSIBOR TARDIS: You realise what the consequences will be?\nDOCTOR: It will be swift, and painless. I promise.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Then I shall do as you request. One final trip. With the Doctor as my pilot.\nDOCTOR: Just like old times. Is your chameleon circuit still working?\nSIBOR TARDIS: It is.\nDOCTOR: Then it might be helpful if you were to create a door — in your Side, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: TYPE FIFTY.\nNYSSA: But Doctor, if you go back and change the past —\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR: You’1l get what you wanted. This version of events will be wiped out. The last twenty-five years of your life will cease to have taken place.\nNYSSA: But won’t that create another paradox?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It will. But with the type-fifty as the cause.\nNYSSA: And like you said: ‘The time machine which creates a paradox will be destroyed by that paradox.’ You’re asking it to give up its life?\nDOCTOR: At least this way, some good will come of it.\nNYSSA: But then what happens to me?\nDOCTOR: You’11 become a temporal anomaly. Once the new timeline is established, you’1ll no longer have existed.\nNYSSA: Then goodbye, Doctor. Goodbye. And thank you.\nDOCTOR: It’s not me you have to thank.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76. EXT. STREET ON PLANET ZARAT OUTSIDE NYSSA’S HOUSE.\nNYSSA: The planet Valderon in the year thirty-five fifty-six. Very well, Adric. I’1l1 meet you there.\nNYSSA: (SURPRISED) The type fifty! What are you doing here?\nSIBOR TARDIS: I have come to collect you, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: No. No, the Doctor gave me specific instructions —\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know I did, but there’s been a last-minute change of plan.\nNYSSA: Doctor?!\nDOCTOR: Well done. You succeeded in undoing the paradox. Now I’m here to make sure you don’t have to.\nNYSSA: You're travelling inside the type-fifty now?\nDOCTOR: It’s had a change of heart, and has agreed to take you back to thirty-five fifty-six.\nNYSSA: Doctor. My son is in that building. I should be with him.\nDOCTOR: I know. And if you come with me, you will be.\nNYSSA: (SLIGHT LAUGH) Inside that?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. She’s much bigger on the inside.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77. INT. CHRONOSCOPE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: EMERGE.\nSIBOR TARDIS: The year thirty-five fifty-six, as requested.\nNYSSA: We're back in the prison tower. Look - Kartis and Mahandra, are they — [dead]?\nSIBOR TARDIS: No. Merely unconscious.\nDOCTOR: (TO SIBOR TARDIS) Thank you. An extremely accurate landing. Perhaps I should have stolen you, after all.\nSIBOR TARDIS: (BECOMING ILL, LOSING STRENGTH) No, Doctor. You made the right choice. I would have been... too reliable... to have given you the adventures you craved. But at least we had one last journey together.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We did.\nSIBOR TARDIS: (COUGHS) Doctor. The dematerialisation circuit for your type- forty.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nSIBOR TARDIS: You really should get an updated model, one of these days.\nNYSSA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The type fifty is absorbing the time-differential caused by bringing you here.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Doctor. When I look into my future I see nothing. Is this death?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR: It’s nothing to fear. Simply an end to suffering.\nSIBOR TARDIS: Goodbye... my Doctor. (DIES)\nSIBOR TARDIS: TYPE SOUND WHICH POWERS DOWN AND CUTS OFF TO SILENCE.\nNYSSA: It’s dead?\nDOCTOR: Yes. She gave her life to save you.\nDOCTOR: KARTIS /MAHANDRA:\nMAHANDRA: Doctor! Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Mahandra. You’re alright?\nMAHANDRA: Just about.\nKARTIS: What happened? The type-fifty, it was changing the walls and —\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. It’s all over now. The type-fifty is no longer operational.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: BEFORE, LIVESTOCK CLUCKING AND BRAYING AS BEFORE.\nTURLOUGH: So, Kartis. Do you think you’1ll cope, without the Chronoscope to provide justice?\nKARTIS: Without it sending innocent people to prison? I think we might just about manage.\nTEGAN: So all the people in the Alcazar —?\nKARTIS: Have been released. My first act, as the new Prime Elector.\nNYSSA: And your second?\nKARTIS: To have the building converted into an infirmary. We’1ll need it, if we’re to help cure the citizens of the empire.\nDOCTOR: An excellent idea! I’m sure you have a great future in front of you.\nNYSSA: How sure?\nDOCTOR: Reasonably. It’s good never to be entirely certain about these things.\nKARTIS: Now, if you’ll excuse me, my life is all committees and meetings —\nADRIC: It’s time that we were leaving too, Doctor.\nMAHANDRA: Now the formula for the cure has been transmitted to the other colonies, they’ll need all the help they can get. There’s thousands, if not millions, of people in need of treatment.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 159\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you’1ll do fine. It was good meeting you... Adric.\nADRIC: I still can’t quite believe I’ve met the legendary Doctor. You know, for a long time, I thought my mother had just made you\nADRIC: up.\nDOCTOR: (A BIT HURT) Oh, really?\nTEGAN: You've gotta admit, you are kind of implausible.\nTURLOUGH: So where are you going now, Adric?\nADRIC: Maxis Realtor. My sister’s there. She was placed in cryogen storage after she became infected.\nTEGAN: Your sister? You mean —\nADRIC: Neeka, yes.\nTEGAN: Neeka? Nyssa, I thought you said she was called —\nNYSSA: What?\nTEGAN: Oh, never mind, it doesn’t matter.\nDOCTOR: Well — good luck, Adric, Mahandra.\nMAHANDRA: Thank you, Doctor.\nADRIC: Yes. Until next time!\nTEGAN: (QUIET) Doctor. What about Nyssa?\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 160\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) Are we leaving her behind?\nDOCTOR: I think we should give her a little time to decide, don’t you?\nADRIC: Mahandra —\nMAHANDRA: It’s alright, I’1ll wait for you in the scout ship. But don’t be long.\nNYSSA: She reminds me of myself at her age.\nADRIC: You still are her age, mother. (BEAT) Come with me.\nNYSSA: Come with you?\nADRIC: To Maxis Realtor. You’ll be able to see your daughter again.\nNYSSA: You know there’s only room in the scout ship for two.\nADRIC: I could leave Mahandra here, she wouldn’t — [mind]\nNYSSA: No, Adric. You need her, more than you realise. And you don’t need me. You’ve proved that. I couldn’t be more proud of you.\nADRIC: Mother —\nNYSSA: I’m so glad I got to see the man my son grew up to be.\nADRIC: I’m glad to have met you too. The mother I thought was dead.\nNYSSA: This isn’t goodbye. I’1ll meet you again, and Neeka, in one month’s time. On Maxis Realtor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 161\nADRIC: You promise?\nNYSSA: Of course. (SHE KISSES HIM) With all my heart.\nADRIC: Then we’ll be there, waiting for you. In one month’s time.\nNYSSA: Until then, Adric.\nADRIC: Until then, mother.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 162\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nNYSSA: Doctor. I’ve made a decision.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I expected as much.\nTURLOUGH: And?\nTEGAN: What’s it to be?\nNYSSA: Doctor. Take me to Maxis Realtor, one month from now.\nDOCTOR: With pleasure.\nDOCTOR WHO: PRISONERS OF FATE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 163\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80. EXT. TOWN STREET.\nMAHANDRA: (DISTANT) Adric! The ignition’s begun. We have to go, now!\nADRIC: I’m on my way!\nADRIC: (NARRATION) I still remember it like it was yesterday. My mother turning\nADRIC: away and walking back into that beaten-up blue box, before it faded away to nothing... and I never saw my mother again.\nADRIC: THE END"
