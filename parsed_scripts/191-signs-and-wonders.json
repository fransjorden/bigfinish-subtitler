Already a flashmob of several hundred has gathered for what they’re calling ‘Rufus Stone Day’. People keep arriving, and we’ve seen local bands, acrobats and fire-eaters. No sign of the man himself as yet...\nNEWSREADER: We don’t know exactly what to expect, but online rumours and word-of-mouth suggest that after the entertainment here, there’1ll be a parade through the streets to the dance-stage and sound system that’s being set up right now in the park. Rufus Stone has said... well, he’s said this is the last day. Stone is the media sensation that came from nowhere. Famous for being famous, after his triumph on reality TV last year, he’s been touring cities across the North-West with his own brand of cod- philosophy. Are your nightmares predicting the end of the world? Rufus Stone seems to think so, and he’s promised he’11l reveal all later today.\nRUFUS: (VIA PA IN B/G) (WHOOPS) Yeah!\nNEWSREADER: (OVER NOISE) That’s him, taking the stage now. Church leaders have objected, saying he’s stealing from every organised religion to suit himself. Stirring things up. But he’s certainly drawn a crowd. Not surprising perhaps, when a free festival springs up wherever he goes. Let’s see what he has to say-\nNEWSREADER: (FX: A CROWD GATHERED AT A RALLY, FALLS QUIET AS RUFUS PREPARES TO SPEAK)\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) (WHOOPS. SHUSHES CROWD, THEN SERIOUS) And in the end days, there will be dreams and visions. I know you’ve had ‘em. We all have. It’s not written down anywhere. You won’t find any of this in your New Testaments or Old. Your Qurans or your Torah. I’m talking about the here and now. The days we live in.\nRUFUS: (SUDDENLY LIVELY) And today we’re gonna partyyyy! Woo-hoo!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 2\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) I know what they’re saying on the telly. Rufus Stone is just some numpty. Just another loon predicting the end of the world. Well, look out, ‘Look North’. You’re wrong.\nRUFUS: I’ve been right across this green and pleasant land. I’ve listened to England’s beating heart. I’m not talking about the cesspits down south. That’s England’s belly and its bowels.\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) You know what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the North. Some of you lot have been with me from the start. Followed me from Sheffield to Manchester. Bolton to Leeds and back again. I’ve no favourites. You’re all welcome. And I’m gonna do my best to save you all.\nRUFUS: Today’s gonna be a blinder. Today’s gonna be a day of signs and wonders. But first. Let’s have the sounds and dancing. I give\nRUFUS: you ‘The End of Days’.

Almost missed you.\nJANET: It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me But my darling when I think of thee.\nSALLY: Thought I’d find you here. (FX: CLOSES CHURCH DOOR)\nJANET: Hiya. (GETTING UP) You’ve got me sussed. Only agreed to help out at this church so I could do my brass-rubbings.\nSALLY: (WALKING OVER) What are they? Eagles? Shields?\nJANET: Arrows too. The same symbols carved in Kirklees. Can’t tell if these are meant to be snakes or... something else... Fascinating stuff. (BEAT) How about you, Sally love? All packed up?\nSALLY: Yeah. Ready to hit the road. Stayed longer than I should have anyway.\nJANET: You and me both. Worked out where you’re going yet?\nSALLY: Not exactly. Got my papers through from my old unit. Had a contact pull some strings to account for my ‘compassionate leave’. Might just sign up with them again. Belong somewhere, you know?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 4\nJANET: I know all about belonging, Sally. Dog collar, remember?\nSALLY: Yeah, I suppose being a vicar is like having a squadron. Being part of a club.\nJANET: And the good Lord gave us lots of clubs to choose from.\nSALLY: Well, even though you’re not in the Catholic squad, I’m glad I met you at St Michael’s. Before the funeral.\nJANET: That’s why I’m doing this. You don’t think I’m touring every church in the North-West just to sketch medieval carvings?\nSALLY: I did wonder...\nJANET: It’s just a cover. I’m here to meet people. Help people. Get some perspective.\nSALLY: You’ve helped me these last few weeks. I don’t know what I’d have done without you.\nJANET: I know. Always hard to say goodbye — it’s not about how long you’ve known them, it’s how close you are. Well. You’ve got St Christopher looking after you now.\nSALLY: What? (TOUCHING NECKLACE) Oh, this. Yeah. It belonged to a friend.\nJANET: You’ve seen a lot of death, Sally Morgan. Don’t let it make you old before your time. Are you sure soldiering is the right thing?\nSALLY: It’s all I know. (BEAT) Janet.. I had another of those dreams last night.\nJANET: Go on.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 5\nSALLY: I was lying there. In agony. Like I’d been shot. Right in the guts. Everything around me white. And the pain... I was screaming. I think I woke myself up. Look at my palms. Dug my nails right in.\nJANET: Ouch.\nSALLY: Everyone’s saying they’re premonitions. About... how they’1l die. They’re seeing earthquakes. Monsters. Loads of people with the same nightmares. Giant black slugs sucking the life out of them. Everyone’s on about it. Rufus Stone was interviewed-\nJANET: Don’t talk to me about that charlatan.\nSALLY: I thought, it’s just coincidence. You know when you hear an old song then suddenly it’s everywhere. But it’s more than that.\nJANET: People are worried about bad dreams, love. So they have bad dreams. Probably feeds itself. Everyone has nightmares. Doesn’t mean they’1l1 come true.\nSALLY: (BEAT) Janet. Have you...?\nJANET: Blackness. That’s all I get. Falling forever and ever. Into darkness. Not very nice. But like I said. It’s a dream.\nSALLY: (FX: HOIKING UP RUCKSACK) Well the world better not end before I catch my train. I’1ll take a last wander round. I’ve grown quite fond of this city. Got a buzz all its own.\nJANET: The pool of life, they used to call it. Everyone feels at home here. No matter where they’re from. Take care, Sally. If you ever need a friend. Well, you know where I am.\nSALLY: Yeah. I’1ll just look for the nearest brass rubbings. Thanks Janet. For everything. Bye.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 6\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: INT.

It gets a bit much for him. Sometimes he just wants to be left alone.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps that’s what we should do.\nACE: You never wanted him here in the first place, did you?\nDOCTOR: Ace. We can’t carry on. Some people aren’t cut out for life aboard the TARDIS. Do you think Hector’s enjoying himself? Do you really think he wants to be here? With us?

About me?\nACE: No. We were just deciding where to go next.\nHECTOR: Come off it. If my ears were burning any more they’d set me hair on fire.\nDOCTOR: I’1l.. let you two decide on our destination. I’ve left a kettle on somewhere. Several kettles, probably. (FX: GOES OFF)\nACE: So where do you fancy? You’ve seen space. The far-off future. Ancient Greece.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 7\nHECTOR: Yeah. And that all went well, didn’t it? You know where I wanna\nHECTOR: go.\nACE: Yeah I know what you said. But now you’ve had a chance to think about it-\nHECTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Ace. I wanna go home. Or at least the nearest thing to home I know.\nACE: Listen...\nHECTOR: Take me back to Liverpool. Twenty-twenties. That’s where I belong.\nACE: But I can’t give up-\nHECTOR: The Doctor’s right. Some people aren’t cut out for this. I think we worked that out a while ago, you and me.\nACE: Hector-\nHECTOR: It’s not doing either of us any good. Go and get him to program the satnav, or whatever. I’ve made me decision. Stop the TARDIS, I wanna get off.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: EXT.

Hope you’re all having a good time!\nSALLY: (WALKING, TO SELF) The apocalypse guy. Well, we can’t all party like it’s the end of the world. Some of us have places to go.\nRUFUS: (DISTANT OVER P.A.) In a bit, we’re all gonna go for a little wander. Down to the park. Take a stroll around this glorious city one more time. So behave yourselves. Keep together, and be polite to the dibbles. ‘Cos when we get there, we’re gonna be ‘avin’ it large!\nRUFUS: And I’m gonna tell you a story. About why I’m here.

If I’m staying.\nACE: (STOPPING) This is it. Gerrard Street. Number fifty-three isn’t it?\nHECTOR: I dunno. I’ve never been.\nACE: She brought you up here. It’s your nan’s street.\nHECTOR: Not my nan. I don’t remember being here.\nACE: If you want to find a home, like you said. Then surely this is the best place to start.\nHECTOR: Dunno if it’s that easy. I don’t know these people. Maybe we should-\nNEIGHBOUR: (INTERRUPTING, CALLING) Hey? You from the council?\nACE: You what? No, we’re friends of Hilda.\nNEIGHBOUR: Oh. You haven’t heard then?\nACE: We’ve been out of the country.\nHECTOR: A long way out of the country.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 10\nNEIGHBOUR: The old girl passed a month or so back. You’ve missed the funeral I’m afraid. Right old knees-up it was. I mean, I’m not even family, but I didn’t get home till gone midnight-\nACE: (OVER NEIGHBOUR) Hilda Schofield... she’s dead?\nHECTOR: Right. Not much point us sticking around then- Hang on. (CALLING) What year is this?\nNEIGHBOUR: What year? Different time zone was it?\nACE: Sorry. He gets a bit confused. Did you know Hilda well?\nNEIGHBOUR: Pleasant old dear. Bit bonkers by all accounts. I only moved in last year, but I’d heard all about that business with her grandson. Very sad.\nACE: Oh yeah. When was that?\nNEIGHBOUR: Couple of years ago now.\nHECTOR: Two years? He’s brought us back two years after we were last here?\nNEIGHBOUR: Still, she had that young lass stopping with her. Nice girl. Sally.\nACE: Sally. (REALISES) Morgan. (TO NEIGHBOUR) She still around?\nNEIGHBOUR: Oh no. Went off to the station this morning. Came to say goodbye. Lovely manners. That’s why I thought you was the council. Quick off the mark before squatters get in. Now don’t you lot go putting any old family in there. None of them London refugees. This is a nice neighbourhood now.\nACE: (OVER NEIGHBOUR) Thanks. Come on, Hector.\nHECTOR: Thanks.

A good life.\nDOCTOR: I hope he’s learned something. That his time with us wasn’t wasted...\nDOCTOR: (FX: SWITCHING ALERT OFF) Yes, you were right, old thing. Best not to land exactly where we left off. Give it a wide temporal berth.\nDOCTOR: Or is that... something else? (BEAT) Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Interference with your telepathic circuits. Psychic disturbance... If it can do that to you, what’s it doing to all the people out there...?\nDOCTOR: How to find out what’s going on..? Listen to local radio.\nRUFUS: (VIA RADIO) You know. I know. Something’s coming. So let’s party like it’s the end of the world!\nNEWSREADER: (VIA RADIO) Rufus Stone there, speaking live at his impromptu festival down in Mathew Street. So far there’s been music, parades and dancing in the street. The crowd’s getting bigger all the time. They’re currently marching along North John Street towards the park. Police say it’s a good-natured carnival atmosphere, and they’re keeping their presence low- key.\nNEWSREADER: Now, the weather. Well, it might be October but we’re still having the warmest autumn on record. Not a cloud in the sky. So get down to Rufus Stone Day while the party’s still going. It might be your last chance after all-\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 13\nDOCTOR: Mathew Street. The Cavern. Eric’s. Carl Jung. And now Mr Rufus Stone. Things get started in Mathew Street. It’s always been the place to be.\nDOCTOR: No rain. But I’d best take my brolly. Just in case.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. STREET\nHECTOR: You’re mad. I’m not climbing over there into a dead woman’s garden. And I’m definitely not breaking into her house.\nACE: (CLIMBING) It’s your house! Come on. Surely it’s worth a try. There might be something in there. Something that’1ll remind you.\nHECTOR: Lay off, will you, Ace. I’m not him. Hex got lost when his ‘memory container’ got destroyed. That champagne. There’s nothing left. In that bottle. In me. Anywhere.\nACE: Don’t say that. You can’t give up.\nHECTOR: It’s gone on long enough. That’s what I am doing. And that’s what you should do an’all. Give up. It’s a lost cause. Stop trying to turn me into something I’m not.\nACE: Hector. You played in that garden. Don’t you feel anything, knowing she’s dead? The woman who looked after you?\nHECTOR: She didn’t! She’s just a stranger. All I’ve got is the fake history of some gangster’s life. Even that’s fading away. I’ve got no memories I can rely on. Nothing. I can’t remember where I played as a kid. What my mum was like. Even if I did. I can’t be sure what’s real and what’s been put there.\nHECTOR: I’m sick of it. I wanna start building new memories in a normal place. A normal life. I just want to be like everyone else.\nACE: But you’re not like everyone else. You’re Hex.\nHECTOR: Have you even been listening? I’m not. There’s a hole where Hex should be. And you can’t just stuff it full of your ideas of who he is. Was. You can’t do it, Ace. You can’t turn me into him. (TURNS AWAY)\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 15\nACE: (JUMPS DOWN.

You’re only hurting yourself even more.\nACE: Hector.\nHECTOR: Leave me alone. There’s the bus. I’m going back into town. And I’m gonna find the Doctor. Say goodbye.\nACE: No, listen-\nHECTOR: (WALKING AWAY) Stay away from me, Ace. Just. Keep away.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT. LIVERPOOL PARK ENTRANCE\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) Glad you all made it. Seems like a few more have turned up. Can you hear me at the back?\nRUFUS: Now this is more like it. Bit of legroom for a rave. But... you can’t have a rave when the lights are still on, can ya? So whaddya say, I turn ‘em off? (COMMANDING) Let... there... be... dark!\nDOCTOR: (ARRIVING IN CROWD) I see the weather’s taken a turn for the worse. Total eclipse. How did he manage that, I wonder?\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) So now it’s time for the light show! One, two, three!\nRUFUS: Don’t you worry, it’s not gonna rain. Not today of all days. I’m bringing you something brilliant. Something amazing.\nDOCTOR: Are you indeed?\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) Some of you’ve been with me since the start. A lot of you joined after the miracle of Wigan. And I don’t mean them staying up in the Premier League.\nDOCTOR: (PUSHING THROUGH THE CROWD) Excuse me.. Thank you... Room for a little one? Can I just...\nRUFUS: (VIA PA) No. That was turning point. They started to listen. They laughed of course. But they listened too. And now we've come full circle.\nRUFUS: That wasn’t just me at Wigan, you know. Feeding all them people. The guys in the wheelchairs. I didn’t do that. You did. Same at Blackpool. People helped each other. We all give strength to each other. And you need to help yourselves now. (CLICKS FINGERS) Apocalyptic enough for ya?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 17\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) How is he doing that?\nRUFUS: Hope you’re all lovin’ it, lovin’ it, lovin it! (QUIETER) Cos, sorry to keep banging on about it. But, you know... end of the world. (BEAT. LOUD AGAIN) You ready to party? DJ, one more tune. Make it immense!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE PARK\nHECTOR: So many people. No wonder the buses couldn’t get through...\nJANET: (OFF, IN CROWD) Let me through. Hey mind out. Excuse me. Sorry. (FALLS) Aah!\nHECTOR: (RUNNING TO HELP) Hey. Are you all right?\nJANET: Yes. Just lost my footing. I was trying to squeeze through.\nHECTOR: I don’t think they were taking any notice.\nJANET: No. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em, eh? Thanks. I’m all right now. You get along if you want to go hear what he’s got to say.\nHECTOR: What who’s got to say? Who’s everyone come to see? Is Macca doing another farewell gig? Sounds a bit rave-y for hin...\nJANET: Don’t tell me you’ve not heard of Rufus Stone?\nHECTOR: Who’s he? A rock star?\nJANET: Might as well be. All this fuss. You don’t mind if I take your arm do you... er?\nHECTOR: Hector.\nJANET: Hector. Valiant warrior of Troy.\nHECTOR: How do you- (STOPS) Oh yeah. Right.\nJANET: Janet. Reverend Janet Green. Let’s go and see the circus shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. TRAIN STATION\nSALLY: (FX: PRESSING BUTTONS ON TICKET MACHINE) OK. Let’s try again. Economy... One-way... London...\nSALLY: What do you mean, ‘no service’? It’s up there on the board. Six o'clock tonight.\nTANNOY: We regret to announce that due to unforeseen circumstances there are no further departures to London Euston this evening.\nSALLY: Fine. You win. Let’s try... Birmingham. (FX: MORE BUTTONS) They can’t all be cancelled. There must be a train going somewhere... (BEAT) Where’s my charge card gone? (FX: TRIES A FEW MORE BUTTONS) You swallowed it?\nSALLY: (FX: HITS IT) Come on, you stupid machine.\nACE: (CALLING, OFF) Oi! Getting violent with power-mad tin-cans? That’s my job.\nSALLY: Ace? (SEES HER) Ace!\nACE: Er yeah. Soldier girl. Sally. How you doing? It’s... been a while.\nSALLY: What are you doing here? I mean it’s good to see you and everything, but how did you know I’d be- (BREAKS OFF, WORRIED) Oh no. You haven't.\nACE: Haven’t what?\nSALLY: Brought him. (GASPS, SUDDENLY HOPEFUL) Is he-?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 20\nACE: (CUTTING HER OFF) No. No — he’s still Hector.\nSALLY: So you have brought him along. What a stupid thing to do.\nACE: Nice of you to keep up the happy-to-see-me act all of what... seconds?\nSALLY: Have you any idea what’s going on?\nACE: I heard about Hilda. I’m sorry. That must’ve been hard.\nSALLY: Yes. Yes it was. But I did it. On my own. I’m just about to start putting my life back together. But there’s other stuff happening too. Weird stuff. And now you turn up. Where’s the Doctor?\nACE: What was that?\nSALLY: The lights. What happened to the lights?\nSALLY: ten\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: EXT. LIVERPOOL PARK, BACK OF CROWD\nHECTOR: Flippin’ heck. He is a rock star.\nJANET: It shouldn’t have got this far. (TO SELF) How’s he doing it? How’s he got everyone believing his lies?\nHECTOR: It’s a free country isn’t it? People can believe what they want.\nJANET: A parade. A stage. A few bands. A free festival. That’s not what he’s about. If you listen to him. What he’s been saying. That’s not what he’s really about.\nHECTOR: You know a lot about him?\nJANET: I’ve been following him. Across the North West. Even had a few run-ins with him at some of his smaller rallies. At the start. He’s... dangerous.\nHECTOR: Hate to break it to you Reverend Janet, but maybe the kids just aren’t into hymns and prayers any more. They’d rather rave all night with this guy than get up on a Sunday and go to church.\nJANET: No. It’s more than that.\nHECTOR: You can’t blame this fella for poaching your congregations.\nJANET: It’s not just the church that’s in danger. That’s the least of it. It’s everyone.\nHECTOR: You what?\nJANET: Come on. He’s coming back on stage. I want to get closer.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. LIVERPOOL PARK, FRONT OF CROWD\nRUFUS: Dunno about you lot, but I.. am. buzzin’!\nRUFUS: Can you feel the energy? We got it all right here. See that?. Lights are going out all over town. There goes the Town Hall. The station. The McCartney Museum.\nRUFUS: It’s another sign. A sign we’ve had our fun. And now the work begins. Don’t be afraid. If you’re here, that’s a start. It means you can listen to what I’ve got to say. And that might just save your life.\nRUFUS: Now, who wants to be saved?\nRUFUS: I said, who wants to be saved?\nRUFUS: Because you will need saving. And it’1ll be a choice. (BEAT) You all had a proper mad one today?\nRUFUS: Nice one. Sorted. ‘Cos, listen. Here’s the serious bit. The end isn’t just nigh. It’s now. Tonight. You’ve seen the signs across the world. Natural disasters. Disease. Wars. Starvation. But the North is the chosen land. Liverpool the chosen site of the final great battle. Power’s down everywhere. Everywhere but here. Everything’s stopped. Buses. Trains. No-one in or out.\nRUFUS: You all know about the dreams? Well, some of you have seen this coming.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: Some of you will know what happens next. To you. You might even have seen... how you die. Don’t be afraid. It’s all part of the plan.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING FROM CROWD) Con-man! Fraud!\nRUFUS: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) This is all fake!\nRUFUS: Down there. Put the spotlight on him. Give him a mike. (TO DOCTOR) You’re not here to be saved, fella? You don’t believe?\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe there’s anything these people need to be saved from. (GETS MIC) Except perhaps, you. (BEAT) Anyone can predict an apocalypse. I should know. I’ve seen a few.\nRUFUS: Go on. I’m open to all points of view. But the signs are all there. The horsemen are riding. You can’t deny that, fella.\nDOCTOR: (VIA MIC) I’m just saying. You can choose any time in human history. You’ll always find war. You’1l always find plague. You’1l always find famine.\nDOCTOR: If you’re ticking boxes for the end of the world, the four horsemen are on permanent rotation.\nRUFUS: I see there’s some think you’ve got a point. Come on. Up on\nRUFUS: stage. Join me... mister...?\nDOCTOR: (VIA MIC) Doctor. I’m on my way.\nRUFUS: Give him a hand, then. Let’s hear it for.. the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. TRAIN STATION\nACE: This way. I think the steps were back here.\nSALLY: There’s a lot of strange stuff been happening. I was going to try and hook up with the Department again. One of those taskforces, anyone. I’d filled in forms. Confirmed my ID. Going down to London for interviews.\nACE: Strange stuff? What strange stuff?\nSALLY: Lights in the sky. Weird weather. Bad dreams. The trains all stopped running just now.\nACE: You think the world’s ending ‘cos British Rail’s kaput?\nSALLY: What happened to the power, then?\nACE: (UNSURE) Coincidence?\nSALLY: That’s what I thought about the dreams. But everyone’s been getting the same thing... Premonitions.. Flashes of visions... Aaaaarrgh! (CRIES IN PAIN, SINKS TO FLOOR)\nACE: Sally?\nSALLY: (PANTING) I... I just thought about it.. and I’m there... I’m in there now... My nightmare. My future... it’s in dreams...\nACE: Morgan? What are you on about? You’re not dreaming. You’re awake.\nSALLY: (DELIRIOUS) Where am I? The walls are white... (CRIES OUT IN PAIN) Ace...? Are you there? I can’t see you.\nACE: I’m here, Barbie. Here. Take my hand.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 25\nSALLY: (GASPING) Always the same... (CRIES OUT) Pain... in my.. (SCREAMS IN\nAGONY: )\nACE: Sally!\nACE: (TO SELF) What now? Earthquake?\nACE: Hold on, Morgan! Hold on!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. LIVERPOOL PARK, BACK OF CROWD\nHECTOR: What’s he up to now? The Doctor?\nJANET: You know that fella? He’s challenging Mr Stone. Could have done with a few more people doing that early on. Maybe things wouldn’t have got so far out of hand.\nHECTOR: He’s up on stage with him.\nJANET: What’s he going to do? Sing a song?\nHECTOR: We'd be getting off lightly. Just pray he didn’t bring his spoons.\nRUFUS: (DISTANT, VIA P.A.) Very well, Mr Doctor. Now you’re here. What is it you want to say?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: EXT. LIVERPOOL PARK, ON STAGE (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: I think everyone should go home.\nRUFUS: Don’t tell me, you’re just a party-pooper? The kids being too noisy for you?\nDOCTOR: Crowds create a psychic energy. A potent force. I don’t know why, but this man is manipulating you for his own purposes.\nRUFUS: Who’s spouting the mumbo-jumbo now, Mr Doctor? (CHUCKLES) What do you say you lot, shall I let him carry on?\nRUFUS: Ooh. Tough crowd.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes people don’t know they need help. Don’t realise the danger they’re already in.\nRUFUS: Don’t take it to heart, Mr Doctor. We’re agreed on something then. Something’s coming. No-one ever believes a prophet in his own land. That’s why I left Macclesfield. Well, not the only reason.\nDOCTOR: If the world were about to end, I’d know. But for some reason, you need people to think it’s true.\nRUFUS: Come on then. What am I supposed to be doing here?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Not yet.\nRUFUS: You don’t know. But I do. And that’s why everyone’s been here today. Why they’ve gathered. This is just the beginning. I’ve a whole load of miracles to show off before we reach the end of the end of days. So, we might as well ‘ave a large one!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 28\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Humans... I don’t know why I bother...\nRUFUS: Aw... don’t go, Mr Doctor. Don’t go. You see I can give even the non-believers something no religion’s ever offered before.\nRUFUS: I can give you... proof.\nDOCTOR: Proof? You’re going to make the sky crack open? Bring down the\nDOCTOR: portents of the end of the world?\nRUFUS: (BEAT) Something like that, yeah.\nRUFUS: (FX: SNAPS FINGERS. CRACK OF THUNDER. SOUND OF HUMMING ENERGY BEAM.

They have chosen you.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING, HELD BY ENERGY BEAM) What... are... you?\nRUFUS: Do you believe me now, Mr Doctor?\nRUFUS: The angels are here. Look up. Everyone.

You are welcome here.\nDOCTOR: And you are...?\nPRASKA: Empress Praska of the Third Holy Aquilian Empire. Daughter of Veska the Magnificent (may his plumage never fade). You have passed through our matter transportation beam, so you may be a little disorientated. Would you care for some tea?\nDOCTOR: Eagles... You look like eagles... in golden armour.\nPRASKA: I understand that some species have made this comparison.\nDOCTOR: And when it suits you, you can look like angels. Or gods?\nPRASKA: When it suits. Precisely. And for the moment, it suits our purpose for you to remain here. To allow our agent to do his work.\nDOCTOR: Your.. agent? Rufus Stone. He’s doing your bidding.\nPRASKA: He answered our call. He has been an ideal representative on Earth, but we thought it time we enhanced his... theatre.

You can see the city set out below. This Liver-pool. But you are mistaken. The people are not our purpose.\nDOCTOR: The eclipse. The thunder and lightning. You’re projecting a solar shield.

In more ways than one.\nPRASKA: The mortals know so little of their part in our destiny.\nDOCTOR: They are not tools to be used, these humans. (BEAT) And yes. I'd love some tea.\nPRASKA: Of course.

Doing as they’re told.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 36\nHECTOR: Only some. Everyone else is sticking around. They really do anything he tells them. They’re all so calm.

With your many faces.\nDOCTOR: So you know what I can do.\nPRASKA: You are a protector. Like us. We extend our protection to the whole of this region.\nDOCTOR: Do you? Your benevolence has boundaries, then?\nPRASKA: Some incursions have been inevitable. We do not control all planes of being. Our power is not limitless. Not yet.\nPRASKA: But as far as we are able, using the means granted to us by the Emperor Veska (may his flight through eternity be without end) — we shield this sacred land from direct assault. Many have tried. But we deflect their ships, their weapons, their agents, further to the south. There they can be dealt with by others. Others such as yourself, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I see. You guard this part of the Earth. Of England. Jealously. And I bet you pop down every so often to shake a feather. Stick your beaks in.\nPRASKA: When it has been necessary, yes. Always for good. Always for protection.\nDOCTOR: You're in their legends. Liver Birds. Defending the city of Liverpool.\nPRASKA: Not just this city. Across this region lies the power we protect. Buried deep within and beneath. Between the dimensions of down and around.

Preparing them for their greatest battle.\nDOCTOR: How very considerate of you. And who is this battle against?\nPRASKA: The Hirudines are coming. And they will feed. I must attend to our preparations. You will remain here. Securely.\nDOCTOR: Hirudines. Inter-dimensional leeches sucking up psychic energy bleeding between realities. If they ever existed at all, they’re a legend of the old universes. Extinct. They’ve no place here. (BEAT) Why now?\nPRASKA: Because now is the end of days.

But I think everyone made it out.\nSALLY: I don’t pass out. (GETTING UP) We should go too. Assess the damage.\nACE: Hang on. You did a pretty good impression of being unconscious. Not to mention all the screaming before. What’s wrong with you?\nSALLY: (FX: PICKING UP HER STUFF) Nothing. It’s just a dream. It’s not real. Never had it while I was awake before.\nACE: What was it then? Hallucination? You never struck me as the hysterical type.\nSALLY: It’s not just me. It’s everyone round here.

That we can jog his memory. Somehow bring him back-\nSALLY: (ANGRY, OVER HER) He was already dead, Ace. (QUIETER) He was already dead.\nACE: Yeah. Give up. Some soldier you turned out to be.\nSALLY: Don’t you dare judge me...\nACE: I tried. At least I tried to do.. something.\nSALLY: It’s not a competition, Ace. Why does everything have to be a contest with you?\nACE: Because it is. Life’s a contest. You’ve got to win. Every time.\nSALLY: (FINALLY SNAPPING) Right, well, look at me. I made it home. I’m living my life. I won. I’m best at life. You got that? Now get out of my way.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 41\nACE: No way, Barbie.

We’re going to the Pier Head, but I got to attend to some business. I need a man with a good story to keep the crowd onside.\nHECTOR: Me?

That must be why we started fighting-\nJANET: No. Nothing like that. If anything, it’s been deadly calm. Any problems you two have are all your own.\nACE: So, the sun disappears, the ground splits open and everyone politely walks away?\nJANET: Pretty much, yeah. Telly’s off. Radio too. Most people went home to wait and see. The rest are along with him, heading for the river.\nACE: You're right. I can see a line of people. Looks like a march.

I like gubbins.\nDOCTOR: There! (GETS UP, PACES) An efficient ship like this has a very sensitive environmental control system.\nDOCTOR: So if I happen to have re-routed the fire-alarm sensor to the engine monitors, then spilling something hot... like this tea...\nDOCTOR: Well, that could convince the mainframe that the ship’s thrusters are exploding.\nDOCTOR: And so begin an emergency fuel vent.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 46\nDOCTOR: And if I’ve also re-routed the signal from the pressure sensov... here. (FX: SMASHES CUP ON SENSOR)\nDOCTOR: That might tell the ship its hull’s going to rupture due to unstable atmospheric forces.\nDOCTOR: (WALKS ACROSS ROOM) Pressure vents located here, here and here. So I should stand... here, I think.\nDOCTOR: The warm air currents created by the engine venting will cause an updraft. I simply need to impede my mass-velocity by spreading it across a larger surface area. And drift safely down to Earth. In theory.\nPRASKA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: In other words.

Impressive swim in choppy waters, there, Private.\nSALLY: Just keen to do my bit sir. If I can. I don’t know if you-\nGORMLEY: You can stop right there, Morgan. We ran a DNA test on your profile. You got a special flag off the central personnel database. Quite the expert in the weird and uncanny are you not?\nSALLY: Yes sir. That’s why I came sir. Thought you might want the help.\nGORMLEY: You thought correctly. A strange commission this one. Good to have someone like you along. Glad you’re volunteering.

Do you take on commissions from anyone who asks?\nGORMLEY: We’ve run high security transports before. Archaeological finds. Treasure troves. This was a bit different. Mr Stone was offering a lot of money. His deposit could pay for this ship. With double the amount promised on delivery. Besides, we can always do with the training.\nSALLY: So Rufus Stone turned up on your doorstep with this rock and told you to deliver it here. You do know who he is? What he’s saying?\nGORMLEY: We do now. Gave us this map reference and this time and date. So we're here on cue. He’s expecting an attack. He might just be a loony-tune like everyone says, but we’ve got his deposit. No harm done. Until these symbols lit up gold.\nSALLY: The markings. I’ve seen them before. Do they look like eagles to you?\nGORMLEY: I knew you’d be good. Go on Morgan, what’s your scientific advice?\nSALLY: I think the sculpture needs to stay here. You’ve got it rigged up to monitors, so you’1ll get warning if energy levels approach anything dangerous.\nGORMLEY: You've seen these carvings somewhere else?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 53\nSALLY: That chopper of yours. Fancy flying us back to shore?\nGORMLEY: Too tricky landing with all the crowds. But we’ve some pretty nifty speedboats.\nSALLY: Then they’1ll have to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. CHURCH\nJANET: (CALLING) Rufus? Rufus Stone? I know it’s you.\nACE: (WHISPERS) Who’s Rufus Stone when he’s at home? Which he’s not. Obviously. Cos he’s in your church.\nRUFUS: (CALLING, OFF) Reverend Green. Come on up. It’s a wonderful view.\nJANET: Wait here. I won’t be long.\nACE: (CLOSE) What about Hector? Will you-\nJANET: (CLOSE, INTERRUPTING) Look around. He might be here. I’1l be straight back down. I promise.\nACE: Right. If you can’t trust a vicar, who can you trust? (TIPTOEING, STAGE WHISPER) Hector? Mate? You in here?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: EXT. STREET\nDOCTOR: I’m sure I parked along here... Streetlights would help. And there’s something else, something throwing off my homing senses...\nPRASKA: (FX: TELEPATHIC FX) You may have escaped us physically, Doctor. But I have had time enough to track your psychic spore. It is potent.\nDOCTOR: I do hope this isn’t a collect call. Telepathic communication. I suspected your power was all about mind control.\nPRASKA: (D) You misconstrue our intentions. The mortals here are meaningless to us.\nDOCTOR: No life is without meaning.\nPRASKA: (D) An interesting philosophical standpoint. So many powers are converging. Let us say, the humans are beneath our purview.\nDOCTOR: That’s worse. Do you have any idea how bad an impression you’re making?\nPRASKA: (D) But the boy is interesting.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know who you mean.\nPRASKA: (D) Really, Doctor. We already know his name and our agent has made contact. There are far more dangerous forces at work here. They need to be dealt with.\nPRASKA: All scavengers have so far been deflected, but the Hirudines are only manifesting now. At the weakest points of dimensional cohesion. Where energies are emanating. Telepathic and temporal.\nDOCTOR: Nice talking to you again Praska. But I’m hanging up.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 56\nPRASKA: (D) Doctor! (FADING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Time distortion, psychoactive aliens, parasites from another dimension. This really doesn’t bode well at all. I can sense her. The TARDIS is... scared.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. CHURCH TOWER\nJANET: What is it you want Mr Stone? Why are you here?\nRUFUS: I want the best. For everyone. You don’t believe in me, do you, Janet?\nJANET: You know what I think. Or at least you know I don’t think people should believe all you say.\nRUFUS: You know what it all means. Tonight.\nJANET: Do I?\nRUFUS: Everything I’ve been doing these last few months. It’s all been leading to this. It’s why you’ve been following me.\nJANET: I’m just touring round making a study of medieval carvings in the churches of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire-\nRUFUS: You can drop the cover. You’ve been dogging me every step of the way. Ever since the revelation of Barnsley.\nJANET: Right. So this is it, is it? You’re warning me off? You want me to keep quiet?\nRUFUS: Not me. Nothing personal, you understand. I just do their bidding... And it’s them who want to see you now.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: EXT.

They gonna whisk me away just like they did that Doctor fella? Zap me into oblivion? (CRIES OUT)\nRUFUS: Oh nothing so mysterious, Janet. Your fate’s gonna be much more down to earth.\nJANET: (STRUGGLING) Tell them to... put me down!\nRUFUS: You might remember having a dream about it. Falling into blackness...?\nJANET: No... No... wait...\nRUFUS: You heard the woman. Put her down. (HARD) Drop her.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH (CONTINUOUS)\nACE: Janet! What the- (RUNS OVER TO BODY) Oh no. Oh no, no...\nACE: (YELLING AT RUFUS) Why did you do that?\nRUFUS: (CALLING FROM ABOVE) You gotta pick a side, girl.\nACE: You toerag. Come down here. You and your birdbrain mates come down here and I’1l show you whose side I’m on.\nRUFUS: (CALLING) Sorry. Hector’s waiting. Gotta fly. Carried away on angels’ wings!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH\nGORMLEY: This the place, soldier?\nSALLY: Yeah. Did you see? They were here. They dropped something from the tower.\nACE: (OFF) Janet...? Wake up.. please. Breathe!\nGORMLEY: (FX: COCKING WEAPON) You there. Get away from the body! Stand up slowly and keep your hands where I can see them.\nSALLY: Oh no. Is that... Janet? What happened?\nACE: She fell... No, she was pushed.\nGORMLEY: Hold her. What have you done girl?\nACE: (GRABBED BY SOLDIERS) Me? No. You can’t think I did this?\nSALLY: Captain. Wait. I know this woman.\nGORMLEY: Well, I don’t. Metcalfe, go inside and check the carvings. Get some pictures.\nGORMLEY: (ANSWERING RADIO) Gormley. Go ahead. (GOES OFF, INDISTINCT\nRADIO: CONVERSATION )\nACE: (CLOSE) Great. As soon as they see me, your soldier mates clap me in irons. Did you make that a standing order?\nSALLY: (CLOSE) I’1l sort it out. Who did this to Janet?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 62\nACE: (CLOSE) Rufus Stone.\nSALLY: (CLOSE) But he brought in Captain Gormley...\nACE: (CLOSE) Life in the army not so black and white after all?\nGORMLEY: (RETURNING) OK people. Change of plan. The Heaney’s reporting disturbances in the Mersey. Something’s churning the waters. Whirpools with multiple centres springing up. They think the Mersey Tunnel’s been breached. We’re going back. You two bring the prisoner.\nACE: Get your gorillas off me. I can walk by myself.\nGORMLEY: You’re in custody miss. You don’t have a choice.\nSALLY: What about Janet? What about the body sir?\nGORMLEY: Too late for her, Private.\nSALLY: She was my friend.\nGORMLEY: We need to move now. Return to the carrier while we’re still able. Metcalfe can bring her in the second boat. Good enough?\nSALLY: Yes sir.\nACE: Happy now you’ve got someone giving you orders again, Barbie?\nSALLY: Leave it, Ace. Just... leave it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: EXT. PIER HEAD, DOCKSIDE\nHECTOR: (VIA PA) Hiya. Never done anything like this before. But Rufus thought I should say a few words while he’s off... talking to his angels. Seems to think I can keep you all entertained.\nHECTOR: Well, me name’s Hector Thomas. I lived here a while ago. Some of you may remember. I’ve been a bad man. And a good man. But now, I’m not sure what I am any more.\nHECTOR: But if this really is the end of days like Rufus says... Well, I just wanna do some good.\nHECTOR: You see, I lost my memory. My friends tried to help me get it\nHECTOR: back. But I’m only gonna end up letting them down. Letting her down. (GAINING STRENGTH FROM CROWD) So now, I’ve literally got nothing left to lose. I’m here for youse lot.\nHECTOR: So if Rufus Stone wants me for his champion... What do you reckon?\nHECTOR: You think I can do it? Lead the charge against whatever monsters are coming?\nHECTOR: Nice to know. I’m not the man I was... and it feels good!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. STREET\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS. There she is!\nDOCTOR: Natural tectonics here could never cause tremors on this scale. But then again, the cause isn’t natural.\nDOCTOR: (FX: HIRUDINES SQUELCH FROM CRACKED GROUND. THEY HISS AND RASP AS THEY EMERGE. ACCOMPANIED BY A TERRIFYING INHUMAN GURGLING,\nSUCKING: ENERGY FROM ALL AROUND. )\nDOCTOR: Hirudines. They are real after all.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) Get away from my ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: EXT. PIER HEAD, DOCKSIDE\nRUFUS: Did ya miss me? Ta for waiting. And for giving our pal here your support. As you can see, the river’s not happy. The Mersey’s boiling. This is where all hell breaks loose. I’m glad so many of you‘ve stuck around to join the fight...\nRUFUS: This fine fella. Well he’s gonna show you what it’s all about. You know his name?\nHECTOR: (FIRED UP) Yeah! I’ve got a purpose at last.\nRUFUS: Your name will be remembered. Dunno if you lot know your mythology... but Hector was Troy’s greatest warrior. Liverpool’s got its very own Hector here. And you’re gonna walk that Pier to meet the enemy.\nHECTOR: Do I get a weapon?\nRUFUS: Our faith in you, our kid. That’s all you need. Do you feel it?\nHECTOR: Yeah... (MORE CERTAIN) Yeah! I do. I can feel every one of you looking to me. I can do this for ya. I know I can.\nRUFUS: River’s rising. Mersey Tunnel’s cracked. They’re breaking through. From the darkness, I give you — the Hirudines! The seals are broken! Come and see!\nPRASKA: (FX: TELEPATHY FX) You have done well, our agent. The boy can be another beacon. Like the rock you gave to the military. He will channel the crowd’s psychic energy to those leeches. Feed them, occupy them for some small moments. When the monsters suck the power from him, fear will take over. But by then, the soldiers will be in position. They can do the rest.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 66\nRUFUS: (FX: TELEPATHY FX) Yeah. He seems pretty willing.\nPRASKA: (FX) Hector is an empty vessel. He is missing his soul, his centre. His shell takes what it can to fill the void and the Hirudines will be drawn to him. We need to keep the parasites occupied. Every distraction aids our holy mission.\nRUFUS: (FX) Whatever. All I know is, as futile noble gestures go, it’s gonna be a biggie.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: EXT. STREET\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) Get... away! I can’t... can’t hold you... back with my... mind. Can’t get to.. the TARDIS. Too many... Too... many!\nDOCTOR: Aaaargh!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: EXT.

It’s a homing beacon.\nGORMLEY: It certainly seems to be drawing those things away from the docks. And towards us. (BEAT) This was a good idea was it? Ready to engage on my command, Lieutenant?\nLIEUTENANT: Sir!\nSALLY: Anything to reduce the danger to civilians.\nGORMLEY: You actually signed up to do good, didn’t you soldier?\nSALLY: It’s a bit of a family tradition. Saving people’s lives.\nGORMLEY: Looks like you’ve saved one poor soul anyway. Some idiot jumped into the river.\nSALLY: Give me your bins.\nGORMLEY: What?\nSALLY: May I use your binoculars. Please. Sir.\nGORMLEY: Here. (FX: HANDS OVER BINOCULARS )\nLIEUTENANT: Targets within range of the gunboats sir.\nGORMLEY: Let’s get on with why we’re here.

Why don’t you stay?\nPRASKA: (FX: TELEPATHY) Your spell is broken, our acolyte. The reality of the Hirudines is too much for even the most faithful followers. Fear overwhelms all, but we have harvested enough from their adulation.\nRUFUS: But they’re going. My followers are leaving me...\nPRASKA: (FX) Do not let vanity betray your purpose, our servant. All is in place. We channel the psychic energies you have gathered through the sacred stone. The human soldiers will distract the Hirudines at this most crucial of times.\nRUFUS: I didn’t... I mean.. I didn’t know what to expect.\nPRASKA: (FX) Fear not. It is all part of our plan. The soldiers you\nPRASKA: prepared already battle the parasites. Humanity has much to\nPRASKA: offer in this fight.

No offense.\nACE: Doesn’t sound like they’re giving up easy, whatever they are.\nGORMLEY: Right. You. Out. With me. To the bridge.\nACE: Finally won you over with my charming personality?\nGORMLEY: Believe it or not — and personally I don’t — your DNA is on file too.\nACE: Course it is. I’m more battle-hardened than I look. Take these cuffs off and I might be able to lend a hand.\nGORMLEY: Here. (FX: UNDOING CUFFS) Why do you think I’m taking you out of the brig?\nACE: Thanks. You’re letting me go?\nUNIT: has a profile on you. Dorothy McShane. 1963. 1997. 2025. And several other years that make just as little sense.\nACE: I’ve got a profile? Nice. Oh yeah. Me and Chunky and Alastair and Winifred. We all go way back.\nGORMLEY: As fast as we blow these things up, more of them keep coming. Frankly. I’m after all the help I can get.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 76\nACE: Blowing things up. Now that’s got to be in my file.\nGORMLEY: Up the ladder to the bridge. After you.\nACE: Cheers Captain O’Nemo. (FX: GRABS LADDER, STOPS) What about the dead reverend?\nGORMLEY: She’s not going anywhere. Like I said. We’re a little busy.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: EXT. MERSEY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MOTORBOAT PULLS UP AT QUAY. ENGINE OFF.

Once the current dies down, I’1l take us back to the carrier.\nHECTOR: (STARTS TO CLIMB OUT) Nah. That’s it for me, love. Ta for the rescue and all, but this is where I get off. Looks calm enough and shallow enough for me to walk to the side.\nSALLY: What are you doing? Get back in the boat, Hex!\nHECTOR: (BEAT, STOPS) So, you do think you know me?\nSALLY: Hex. I knew Hex. Not you. Not Hector.\nHECTOR: And you and Hex. You had a.. thing?\nSALLY: I don’t know. Never got the chance to find out.\nHECTOR: I know who you are now. Sally. Sally Morgan. You stayed with his gran, all this time.\nSALLY: I did. It was kind of her to take me in. Life and soul, Hilda was. And there was still so much life in her... But once she knew he'd gone, when she finally accepted it.. There was nothing left for her to hold on for.\nHECTOR: You can’t look me in the eye, can you?\nSALLY: Is there any point? Maybe I don’t want to see what’s in there.\nHECTOR: Or you’re afraid you might like it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 78\nSALLY: No. I saw what you were like back in your nightclub. In your penthouse. Hector Thomas. A chancer. A gangster.\nHECTOR: That’s not me any more. It never was. That Hector was never really real. Funny thing is, the further I’ve travelled, the more the disguise has fallen away.\nSALLY: All right. So what’s left? Underneath the mask?\nHECTOR: I dunno. Maybe nothing. That’s the problem.\nSALLY: Come with me. Back to the ship.\nHECTOR: You don’t mean that. No. You don’t want me around. And I don’t wanna stick around out here with those... monsters. I’m gonna find the Doctor. He’s alive. I just know he is.\nSALLY: Well, I can’t stop you. (CALLING) If you do find him. Bring him back here. To me.\nHECTOR: (CALLING) Yeah. Your army mates look like they need all the help they can get. (OFF) The Doctor’1l sort ‘em out.\nSALLY: (SOTTO) I wasn’t talking about the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: EXT. EXT.

Give me a figure on casualties.\nACE: There’s dozens of them. You’re surrounded. Every one you turn into sushi, two more are coming up to replace them.\nGORMLEY: When I want your military assessment, I’1l ask for it.\nACE: Well, why else did you bring me up here? To show me your pebble collection? That one’s a beauty, I’ve got to admit.\nGORMLEY: This rock. We think it’s attracting them. Morgan reckons it’s a homing beacon of some kind.\nACE: Alien glowy rock draws in alien slimy monsters? Works for me.\nGORMLEY: I want you to take it.\nACE: As bait? You are joking.\nGORMLEY: Not just bait. If you draw them away from the ship, then it might give us a chance to pick them off. Get an idea of numbers. I’m having the helicopter made ready, and you can carry it on board.\nACE: (CONSIDERING IT) A helicopter ride... You do know how to get around a girl, Captain. Do I get a rocket-launcher too?\nGORMLEY: Hang on. What’s that? Someone’s clearing a path...\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 80\nACE: More like carving a path. I’d know that blast anywhere. Nitro- 9!\nSALLY: (CALLING FROM BELOW) Permission to come aboard sir!\nGORMLEY: Morgan!\nSALLY: (CALLING FROM BELOW) Captain Gormley, sir! I think we’re in trouble.\nACE: No kidding, Private.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: EXT. STREET\nHECTOR: (RUNNING UP) Doctor? Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Hex... No.. Hector. (COMING ROUND) You came back. You came to find me.\nHECTOR: You're alive! I knew. I knew if I just found my way back to the\nTARDIS: you’d be here. Who else is gonna have the faintest idea what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) Sorry to disappoint...\nHECTOR: Here. Let me check there’s nothing broken.\nDOCTOR: Only my mind. I was holding back those parasites from the TARDIS. They were trying to drain the poor thing. Then... they left.\nHECTOR: Slimed off to the river to join their mates. Seen a few coming out of the ground on my way here. Chapel Street’s split in half. I passed ‘em crawling all over St George’s Hall. Amazing what you get used to.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it?\nHECTOR: (HELPS DOCTOR SIT) I’ve got you. Now see if you can sit up. Let me take your pulse. Pulses. (FX: EXAMINES HIM)\nDOCTOR: Nurse’s instinct... Now where did that come from?\nHECTOR: I- I dunno why I’d do that? Why would I do that?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure either. (QUICKLY) Tell me. Where was Cassie born, Hector?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 82\nHECTOR: (QUICKLY) Bolton. Same as me. (BEAT) Wait. How do I know that? Who’s Cassie?\nDOCTOR: Interesting. Flashes of memory. The dimensional fracturing. It’s affected you in a similar way. People notice visions of their future bleeding through. But your past is news to you.\nHECTOR: You mean Hex’s past. Is there... is there some way I can go back after all?\nDOCTOR: No. I think it’s just a flash in the pan. A side-effect of everything else happening here.\nHECTOR: You mean the monsters and the angels and the festival of loons?\nDOCTOR: You concern me, Mr Thomas. You’re a reminder of my mistakes. Something I did wrong. I want to help you, but I don’t know if I can. If I should. (BEAT) I thought you were leaving.\nHECTOR: I guess... When it comes down to it, when it all hits the fan, I know you’re the man who can. I’m glad I’m on your team, Doctor. And that’s me saying that. Hector, not Hex. I know I’ve been pretty useless. More of a liability than an assistant, and I’m probably not worth saving-\nDOCTOR: You’re worth saving Hector. Everyone is.\nHECTOR: How can you though? I mean, you can barely stand up. Here, let me help. (HELPS HIM UP)\nDOCTOR: Yes, hardly a match for the eagle warriors from another dimension. But I can’t help feeling... there’s something even stronger, much darker than the Aquilians or the Hirudines here. A presence...\nHECTOR: Something else? Where?\nDOCTOR: All around. That’s the problem. And I don’t want it getting its hands on the TARDIS. Perhaps if I can slip inside quickly...\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 83\nDOCTOR: Aaagh!\nHECTOR: Doctor? Doctor! What is it? What’s happening to you? What can I do?\nDOCTOR: It’s too powerful. It knows... This force... It’s everywhere... it could destroy the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. AQUILIAN SHIP\nPRASKA: This is what we have prepared for. This is why you are special\nPRASKA: Rufus Stone. From our ship, you can see what we see. You have a gift. A psychic ability we can join with. Let me show you your\nPRASKA: land as we see it.\nRUFUS: It’s amazing. I never thought... never thought I’d see the world like this. We’re so high above it all.\nPRASKA: Look closer. Let me help you see. (FX: TELEPATHY FX)\nRUFUS: Wait.. yeah... I see it. There’s a line... right from the coast, from Merseyside to Manchester, down to Bolton. I can see where I was born.\nPRASKA: To’koth’s time draws near. We sense the gathering spirit as it prepares to free itself from his body.\nRUFUS: The Earth’s cracking. Like a fault line. The Peaks... they’re glowing. There’s a shape. Something... sleeping. A huge creature... curled across the north of England. My God...\nPRASKA: No, Stone. It is our God. To’Koth be praised. He dwells between dimensions and times. He lived life and gave life, and through us, his glory shall be never-ending.\nRUFUS: (AWESTRUCK) Praise be to To’Koth.\nPRASKA: You are correct. There are cracks in the Earth. His passing cannot come without destruction. The mortals below will experience tremors, earthquakes, temporal confusion. You see, a god’s passing has the power to shake all things to their foundation. But together, we can spare the humans the worst torments.\nRUFUS: What can I do? What can I do to help?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 85\nPRASKA: You shall be our channel. Our means to absorb his powers. You will make us gods. Prepare yourself. It is almost time. (BEAT) Why not have.. tea?\nRUFUS: (SURPRISED) Nice one.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: EXT. DECK OF CARRIER ON MERSEY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CHURNING WAVES, BOAT ENGINES, GUNFIRE, SCREECHING\nHIRUDINES: THROUGH. ACE, SALLY AND GORMLEY RUN ACROSS DECK)\nGORMLEY: (OVER NOISE THROUGHOUT) Get down. Take cover. Here, behind the cabin door.\nSALLY: (OVER NOISE THROUGHOUT) Did you see that? The Mersey Tunnel’s cracked open. There are hundreds swarming out of it. Can’t you head them off somehow?\nGORMLEY: What with? We’ve lost most of the gun-boats. They keep attacking from below.\nSALLY: What about our onboard weapons here?\nGORMLEY: Fore and aft gun-turrets.. gone. They’re just not stopping. (FX:\nFIRES: WEAPON) The last report from engineering said they’re starting to dissolve the hull.\nACE: (OVER NOISE THROUGHOUT) If they’re coming from under the water... What about the ‘copter? Up in the air seems like a really good option right now.\nSALLY: From what I’ve seen, I don’t think those things can fly.\nGORMLEY: The chopper won’t either... I’ve lost my pilot.\nACE: Right. Small problem.\nSALLY: But the stone’s already loaded on board.\nGORMLEY: Maybe we should just let them have it. Maybe they’1l stop once they get a hold of it?\nACE: What if we smash it? Blow it up?\nGORMLEY: It’s an idea. (FX: FIRES WEAPON)\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 87\nSALLY: But what’1ll they do then? Whether we destroy it, or hand it over. They’re animals. They’1l just want more. Before the stone was activated the leeches were going for civilians. Who’s to say they won’t just head inland again?\nACE: Original plan then. We take it up in the whirlybird.\nGORMLEY: I told you. I lost my pilot.\nACE: You fly it then.\nGORMLEY: I can’t abandon my men. My ship.\nSALLY: There is someone else here who could do it. (BEAT) Me.\nACE: Sergeant Barbie to the rescue! Really? You can fly a helicopter?\nSALLY: What can I say? Lysandra ran a very thorough training program.\nGORMLEY: What are you waiting for? Get to it soldier!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: EXT. STREET\nHECTOR: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) My hand. Keep hold of my hand...\nHECTOR: Is it helping?\nDOCTOR: You being here, Hector. You’re shielding my mind somehow. Containing the assault. Stay close. Stay with me.\nHECTOR: I’m here Doctor. I’m right here.\nDOCTOR: Good. Good. The mists are clearing. I thought you might be the cause of this. That your being here was breaking things down. But no, it isn’t you. You may be more useful than you know.\nDOCTOR: ‘Liverpool is the pool of life. It makes to live’.\nHECTOR: You what? Can you move?\nDOCTOR: No. But I can think. At last, I can think clearly. For the first time since we arrived. Rufus Stone. His followers. Humanity itself. What if it’s all a distraction?\nHECTOR: There are soldiers and all sorts down by the river. Fighting those massive sea slug things.\nDOCTOR: Just what the Aquilians ordered.\nHECTOR: Aquilians?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 89\nDOCTOR: The golden eagles who flew down for me back at the park. They’re an alien race hovering somewhere overhead in a great big golden spaceship. And they were expecting this. Preparing humanity to fight against the Hirudines.\nHECTOR: (EVEN MORE CONFUSED) Hirudines?\nDOCTOR: The giant leeches. Mindless parasites. Controlled only by appetite. But the real question is, what were they expecting for dinner?\nHECTOR: They were coming for the people, weren’t they? They were coming for me.\nDOCTOR: Only because Rufus Stone was sent to change the menu. Distract them with some tasty appetisers.\nDOCTOR: Ancient and terrible powers are being unleashed here. The\nTARDIS: can sense them. So I can, too. She’s afraid.\nHECTOR: The TARDIS is afraid?\nDOCTOR: Oh she has feelings, Mr Thomas. She liked Hex, but she was never that sure about you.\nHECTOR: You can tell her the feeling’s mutual.\nDOCTOR: Now, Empress Praska and her Aquilian people are psychoactive. They’d be just another source of food if they tried to engage directly with the Hirudines. So that’s what the humans are for.\nHECTOR: (WORKING IT OUT) To keep the leeches occupied while the eagles swoop in on something else.\nDOCTOR: Correct! You do have potential after all, Hector.\nHECTOR: I don’t understand any of this... Just tell me what I can do. How can I help you get back to full strength?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 90\nDOCTOR: You already are. Yes, you, Hector Thomas. You’re a vessel of the Elder Gods. And you’re empty. You may be our only hope of containing what’s been unleashed. But first, tell me, are you getting any more of Hex’s memories?\nHECTOR: No. Nothing. You were right. It was just a one-off.\nDOCTOR: Good. Because Hex couldn’t do this. Only you can, Hector. I think I’m formulating a plan...\nHECTOR: Anything. I’1l do anything, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You need to get to Rufus Stone. Work with him. It’s vital that you find him. And tell him this...\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. HELICOPTER OVER MERSEY\nSALLY: (OVER COPTER NOISE THROUGH) They’re still swarming around the carrier.

The water’s black.\nSALLY: I'll take us back to the docks.\nACE: You’re good at this. Why didn’t you tell me you could drive one of these?\nSALLY: Well. I haven’t. Before.\nACE: I thought you said-\nSALLY: I had training. In simulators. Yeah. But... not in an actual helicopter.\nACE: Don’t... Say any more.\nSALLY: Ace. There is one more thing you should know.\nACE: What?\nSALLY: I don’t think I did landings.\nACE: You didn’t have to tell me that.\nACE: What the- (BEAT) Right, now it’s my turn with the bad news. You know we thought those things couldn’t fly?\nSALLY: Yeah?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 92\nACE: Well, they can jump. Really high.\nSALLY: OK... I’m thinking we need a plan B.

Snap out of your dream.\nSALLY: (RECOVERING) Janet?\nACE: She’s got your stone, Morgan. Look at it. It’s burning white.\nSALLY: (CALLING) Janet? D’you wanna tell me what’s going on?\nJANET: (CALLING, D) You want to feed on some psychic energy you big fat leeches? Eat this.\nJANET: (FX: SHE THROWS THE STONE INTO WATER.

Every last one.\nACE: What are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 98\nJANET: (D) I’m more powerful than you can ever imagine. And I’ve barely got started. Now girls, if you can bring yourself to ignore the pond weed and unhealthy green pallour, I'd like you to think of me as your fairy godmother. I can grant your wishes.\nHECTOR: (DISTANT, CALLING) Hey. You lot. Ace! Sally! Where’s Stone? The Doctor sent me. I’ve got to find Rufus Stone.\nJANET: (D) And what do you both wish more than anything else in the world? You wish that boy wasn’t him.\nACE: Shut up.\nJANET: (D) You’ve got the answer right there, Sally Morgan. Around your neck. You’ve had it all along.\nSALLY: (CRY OF PAIN) My St Christopher! Ow, it’s burning.\nJANET: (D) Not yours though, is it? And it’s so full of him. Very devious those Elder Gods. Never be so obvious as to use a bottle as a.. bottle. More like a decoy. Now if you both want it enough... you can have your heart’s desire...\nHECTOR: (RUNS UP) What are youse all staring it? Listen, the Doctor told me. It’s really, really important that we find Rufus. There’s this power being released and he needs to come here and I need to— (CRIES OUT)\nACE: Sally!\nSALLY: I- I’m all right. It was like a massive energy discharge from the necklace into.. into him. (BEAT) Oh no. (FX: RUNS TO HECTOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 99\nACE: What have you done? What did you do to him?\nJANET: (D) Your friend’s investigating. (CALLING) Hey Sally. You know your fairy stories. Sometimes the prince needs a kiss to wake up. Or something like that. (BEAT) Now I’ve just gotta nip to the Pier. Be back soon! (FX: VANISHES IN A FLASH)\nACE: Where did she go?\nSALLY: (CLOSE) Hector? (CALLING) Ace, he’s waking up...\nACE: (JUST OFF) Morgan.

PIER HEAD, LITTLE WAY OFF\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ENERGY BEAM OF AQUILIAN TELEPORT, RUFUS APPEARS AND STUMBLES. )\nJANET: (D) You took your time. Rufus Stone’s not usually late to any party.\nRUFUS: What happened to the Hirudines? They’re all dead... destroyed. What’s going on? Who are you? Wait, you’re Janet. But you’re not. You’re.. something more.\nJANET: (D) I’m bored of Janet. Call me Ginny Greenteeth. You remember the stories your ma told you when you were little. Stay away from the rivers. Stay away from the moors and the ponds. Or Wicked Ginny will get you. With her dark green hair, yellow eyes, pointed teeth and nails... Do you think I look the part?\nRUFUS: What have you done? I’m supposed to be harnessing the power... for Empress Praska. But I... I can’t feel it.. Where’s it gone?\nJANET: You know what’s happening here, Stone. I’ve already started. To’Koth’s lifeforce will be mine.\nRUFUS: No, we knew you were here. And we got rid.\nJANET: (D) You think something as insignificant as death is gonna stop me? In another life, I am death.\nRUFUS: I’11 summon them. I’11 summon the angels.\nJANET: Your masters dare not face me. The Aquilians know they’d share the fate of those leeches.\nRUFUS: That was you? You defeated the Hirudines?\nJANET: (D) With hardly a thought. You know what the potential is here? I’ve only just begun.\nRUFUS: My masters have the right... To’Koth is their god.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 101\nJANET: (D) He’s not their god. He’s hardly aware of their pitiful existence. He’s one of the Gods. The Elder Gods. From before this universe was a spark of singularity. He arrived so long ago. And I came with him.\nRUFUS: But... I’m meant to be the channel-\nJANET: You? They send you? A paltry mortal container for psychic energy. It’1ll burn you out from the inside in seconds.\nRUFUS: But I was supposed to save the world...\nJANET: (D) Ha! Let me give you just a taste.\nRUFUS: Aaaagh!\nJANET: (D) To’koth is an Ancient One. He’s been dying beneath this Earth for millennia. His life force will be freed and this universe will have never seen the like. It will be the ultimate power in this reality.\nJANET: And it will be mine.\nRUFUS: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 102"

I wasn’t playing chess, was I?\nSALLY: Not you, no.\nHEX: No. You’re right. It was cards. With a right couple of weirdos.\nACE: (STANDING JUST OFF) Yeah, when you two have quite finished.\nHEX: Ace? That you Ace?\nSALLY: Here I’1ll help you up. (FX: HELPS HEX TO HIS FEET)\nACE: It’s me, all right. Put him down Barbie. My turn.\nACE: I missed you. I missed you so much, mate. It really feels like you at last.\nHEX: (SQUEEZED) Whoah there. You’re crushing me!\nACE: (LETTING HIM GO) Sorry. Just... it’s good to see you.\nHEX: What’s all this about eh? It’s like you haven’t seen me for years. I mean we were all just together in the TARDIS, but you two are acting like I’ve just come back from the- (BREAKS OFF) Oh. Oh no. (WOOZILY FALLS)\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 105\nACE: Catch him!\nSALLY: I think he’s starting to remember.\nHEX: Oh... my [God]- I was dead. I... died. What the hell-?\nACE: While we’re on the subject. Reverend Indestructible’s on her way over.\nSALLY: Good. She did this. Maybe she can explain.\nACE: You didn’t see what else she did over on the Pier. I’m not so sure she’s one of the good guys.\nSALLY: What do you mean?\nACE: She exploded Rufus Stone.\nHEX: What are you talking about? Is anyone gonna tell me what the hell’s going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: EXT. STREET\nPRASKA: To’Koth, (glory to his blessed name), has lived in this realm for millennia. He has dwelt beneath the people of this land Since before they evolved the language to praise him.\nDOCTOR: Beneath them?\nPRASKA: Within. Beneath. Around. He is not bound by the tiny dimensions here. He hails from the Old Time.\nDOCTOR: An Ancient One. You believe an Elder God of the old universe, an entity like Ragnarok, Fenric or Weyland — has been buried under North West England ever since humanity evolved?\nPRASKA: Those names are known. But they are as gnats to the mighty lion of To’Koth. But the lion is dying. We heard him across the centuries and light years. We attend his hour of need. His life-force can confer infinite power on those with understanding.\nDOCTOR: That’s the problem right there. You can’t possibly have the understanding. You’ve no idea what you’re dealing with.\nPRASKA: To’Koth will-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Elder Gods don’t die in this universe. Even when I’ve defeated them, they’ve always sloped off back to their own dimension.\nDOCTOR: It has never happened. It can never be allowed to happen, because it would unleash energies that have no place here. That could rip this universe apart.\nPRASKA: Those are the powers we will harness.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 107\nDOCTOR: You? You couldn’t even face down a few leeches. What hope do you have of controlling this?\nDOCTOR: No. This explains the itch at the back of my mind ever since we arrived. Why Hector was able to defend me. I should have recognised the stench of an Elder God.\nPRASKA: Do not blaspheme, Doctor. We ask your help to stop this other one.\nDOCTOR: Which ‘other one’?\nPRASKA: We cannot say. We see only dimly. To’Koth knows. He wishes to commune. He has been trying to use your machine.\nDOCTOR: I see. It wants to communicate. (BEAT) Well if this To’Koth really is dying and threatening to tear this dimension apart, I don’t see I have any choice.\nDOCTOR: (FX: UNLOCKS TARDIS) Don’t be afraid, old girl. I won’t let you come to any more harm.\nPRASKA: If you are granted an audience... then I, Empress of the Aquilians, must beg attendance-\nDOCTOR: (CUTS HER OFF) All right. I may live to regret this. But I think you’d better come in.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: EXT. DOCKS\nJANET: My congregation still here? Good. Well, as you can see, reports of my death have been premature.\nHEX: Wh-\nJANET: (OVER HIM) There’s a lot of it about.\nHEX: Who’s this?\nACE: She’s the vicar. The lady vicar. The.. er, zombie lady vicar.\nSALLY: It’s not her, Ace. She was my friend.\nJANET: I was, wasn’t I? Have you any idea how boring it is hanging around you humans for several thousand years? This identity provides some distractions. Army chaplain. Prison visits. Touring the churches of the poor and needy all across the North. Of course I had to keep changing over the centuries. But I’ve always been able to take succour from the desperate.\nJANET: I’d keep coming back too. To Merseyside. To check on him. Recharge myself. Ginny Greenteeth. Janet Green. Wicked Jenny. Peg O’Nell. I let them choose my names.\nJANET: I just had to wait long enough... and he’d die. (FX: ENERGY STARTS TO FLOW INTO HER) Ah... Here it comes...\nHEX: What’s she saying? Ginny Greenteeth?\nACE: Hex, you won’t understand. There’s been monsters and angels and all sorts turning up here.\nSALLY: People predicting the end of the world. Dreams and premonitions...\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 109\nHEX: No. It was something me nan used to say, keep away from the river. Don’t go near, or Ginny Greenteeth will drag you under.\nJANET: Wise words. I’ve grown strong in these waters. Watched all those humans going about their business. Slaving, trading, exploiting the workers. Been no end of suffering for me to feed on. Just to tide me over for a millennium or two. Till I could get to this...\nSALLY: What is that? Looks like light... energy... flowing out from the river. Into her...\nACE: Is that all you are? A parasite, no better than those leeches?\nJANET: I’m soaking it up. Bathing in the power of the Mersey. To’Koth is finally giving up the ghost... To me.\nHEX: Yeah... and all the while, what’s flowing through you is flowing through me too. I know now. It’s all been jumbled in my head. But I’ve memories of where I’ve been. Who I was. Like waking from a dream.\nJANET: You want to be careful remembering dreams, Hector. Ask your soldier friend.\nHEX: I’m not Hector.\nJANET: No. You’re something different now. I made sure that empty vessel was filled-\nHEX: With Hex. I know. But it’s all mixed up in my head... Little bits of stardust left inside. I’ve been to where you came from. It’s all coming back to me. It wasn’t nice.\nACE: Hex. Maybe you’d better sit down.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 110\nHEX: You were right Ace. Ginny Greenteeth’s even less than a leech. A tick. A flea, with eternal life. I saw things like her... when I was dead. Being close to the source.. I remember it all.\nJANET: What?\nHEX: Yeah, this Hector fella. He was a right mess. But the Doctor gave him a job to do. (FX: WALKS TOWARDS JANET)\nSALLY: Hex, what are you doing? You’re not strong enough. Keep away from her.\nHEX: And that job was to stand in your way.\nJANET: You remember the gods, boy? Remember the power they have to create realities. Imagine having that power in this world. This place teeming with life and now it’s all gonna be mine. I’m sick of being mortal.\nHEX: You’re not human. But you were for a while.\nSALLY: Tommy. Please.\nHEX: Don’t worry. I’ve got this, Sal. Look at ‘em, Ginny. My friends. Sal.. well, she’s just amazing. And Ace never gave up on me. Even when I was dead. That’s what humanity’s about. That’s true strength.\nHEX: (WITH EFFORT OF CONCENTRATION) You should know. Living alongside it so long. Living in this fantastic city.\nJANET: What? What are you doing? The power... It’s escaping... No!\nHEX: (STRUGGLING) Not so different, me and you. The world of the ancient gods, and the world of humanity. I’ve tasted both too. And I know which I prefer.\nACE: Hex, mate! You don’t know how dangerous she is...\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 111\nHEX: Come here. Everyone else has had a turn today. Give us a hug, Ginny Greenteeth. (GRABS HER)\nJANET: Get off me, boy!\nHEX: (STRUGGLING) That’s the trick with this self-sacrifice stuff. When you’ve done it once... next time comes easier.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. TARDIS, CONSOLE ROOM\nDOCTOR: Let’s speak to this To’Koth.. Hear its dying words.\nPRASKA: Your craft. It is somewhat impressive. For an ephemeral being.\nDOCTOR: Don’t go overboard, Praska. You’1ll start worshipping me next. (FX: WRESTLING CONTROLS) I’m sorry old girl, this may hurt after all.\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH:\nDOCTOR: We are here, Time Lord. To’Koth hears you.\nDOCTOR: And speaks with Rufus Stone’s voice. Or something like it.\nPRASKA: That is but the channel. Such unknowable majesty must be reduced infinitely to enter mortal understanding. Speak to us, O To’Koth, O magnificence, O-\nDOCTOR: Do stop squawking, Praska. I’m trying to fine-tune the [signal]\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: (FX, BOOMING) I am your god and you will listen to me!\nPRASKA: Yes. Oh majesty. Never, never in my wildest raptures did I believe I could address-\nPRASKA: TO’ KOTH: (FX) Silence!\nDOCTOR: How typical of your kind. So demanding.\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: (FX) You misunderstand Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Do I?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: TO’ KOTH: (FX) To’Koth is in pain. Dying. There is no time.\nDOCTOR: And your death will destroy the Earth.\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: (FX) This To’Koth knows. And it saddens us.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: (FX) To’Koth wants only your help, Time Lord. So we can die in peace. And leave this world unharmed. This world... that we love.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: EXT. DOCKS\nJANET: (FX: DISTORTED, STRUGGLING THROUGH) I’m doing it now. I’m taking it all. You can’t stop me. No! You can’t-\nHEX: (STRUGGLING THROUGHOUT) Yeah? But I can. Feel that, Ginny Greenteeth? That’s me closing off your feeding tube.\nJANET: At what cost boy? The more you hold me back, the more you’re chipping away at yourself.\nHEX: I remember, coming here. Liverpool. To live with me nan. Can’t have been more than three or four. When we moved from Bolton. Back to her home town. To be nearer me dad. Not that he was around that much longer.\nACE: I’ve no idea what you think you’re doing mate... but it’s gonna kill you. Again.\nSALLY: (STOPPING ACE) Wait. Don’t touch him. I think... I think I know what he’s trying to do. Tommy? Can we help you?\nHEX: Ace... Sal... The Doctor said I could block this energy. That Rufus could channel it away somehow. Well he’s not here. At least I can stop this one getting any more powerful... (CRIES OUT)\nHEX: But I mustn’t get swept into her.. Youse two. Help me remember... Keep me grounded... Tell me who I am.\nACE: Got it! Right. Remember who you are. You’re Thomas Hector Schofield. Nurse. St Garts. London. Cybermen, remember?\nHEX: Yeah! That’s it. I... remember\nACE: The Doctor! The TARDIS. Oh... I can’t think. We’ve been everywhere, we’ve done so much good. Florence Nightingale! You went gaga over her...\nJANET: No! I will break him! I... will... win!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 115\nHEX: Tell me more... about me mam. Me family... Where I come from...\nSALLY: Your mum was Cassie Schofield. Your gran, Hilda. She brought you up when Cassie went missing. You loved her so much and she was so very proud of you. We’d stay up into the night Tommy, and she’d tell me all about you.\nSALLY: Coming off your scooter on the jetty. Scraping your knees when you fell off the swing. Accident-prone, she said. No wonder you became a nurse.\nHEX: Sal... Keep going. I remember. We’re the same... you and me... Your granddad... My nan... We’ll get ‘em together right?\nSALLY: Too late for them both now. I missed gramps’ passing too. But I bet they’re up there together with a couple of stouts.\nJANET: No! You cannot do this!\nHEX: Not... pina coladas?\nSALLY: No, that’s our date. You promised. You’ve got to stick around, because you promised. You and me, remember Tom?\nHEX: I... remember.\nACE: (SOTTO) Good girl, Morgan. Good girl.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: INT. TARDIS, CONSOLE ROOM\nDOCTOR: Love? What does an Elder God know of love? All those I’ve met exist only to hate... destroy.\nPRASKA: Doctor! Do not speak so to the mighty To’Koth!\nPRASKA: TO’ KOTH: To care for something more than one’s own life. That is one definition of love is it not?\nDOCTOR: So I’ve heard. But you’re about to destroy this world. This universe. How is that showing love?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: It was not our intent. We waited too long.\nDOCTOR: You came here to die. Didn’t you know-?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH:\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) To’Koth was dying before we came here. We’d grown old in the Old Time, diseased, wearied by age and care. We tired of all our squabbling children. Fenric. Moloch. Mi’en Kalarash. We came and saw this world born around the Racnoss** core. It intrigued us.\nDOCTOR: You decided to stay?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: When the Earth took shape around us, we could move no longer. We were content to remain beneath these lands. And observe.\nDOCTOR: Liverpool. Lancashire. England. A land of dreamers and revolutionaries. All the artists, the visionaries... were you their inspiration, I wonder?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH:\nDOCTOR: No, these mortals were To’Koth’s own fascination. Such energies, such passions, all invested in such tiny insignificant lives. It is a paradox is it not? We dreamed within the rivers and the mountains. We slept a fitful sleep, but now our time is ended. To’Koth tarried too long. And we are filled with sorrow at what will come to pass.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 117\nDOCTOR: Something is stealing your lifeforce.\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: A dark parasite desires it. These scavengers come. The Aquilians have defended us-\nPRASKA: Great Lord. We beg you-\nPRASKA: TO’ KOTH:\nPRASKA: But however well-intentioned, our powers are not meant for this universe. We did not realise the consequences until it was too late.\nDOCTOR: So the question remains. What can I do? To stop this reality being ripped apart by your dying breath?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: There is one place it will be safe. One place our essence can be dispersed with no ill effect.\nDOCTOR: And where is that?\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: Home.\nDOCTOR: ** NOTE: RECORD THIS LINE BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT WORD ‘’RACNOSS’.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: EXT.

Janet’s getting free. He’s letting her\nSALLY: go.\nJANET: That’s it? That is all you pitiful mortal have to give? A few memories and feeble declarations of love?\nJANET: I have waited thousands of years. I can wait thousands more while this boy’s frame rots from his bones. But I sense he will be done long before that.\nHEX: (PANTING) I can’t do it.. Not on me own...\nPRASKA: (CALLING) Allow us to assist, Thomas Hector Schofield!\nJANET: No. It cannot be.\nPRASKA: Reverend Janet Green. You are our foe. Now we have the fury of To’Koth on our side.\nACE: What are you doing in there, birdbrain? Where’s the Doctor?\nPRASKA: Within.\nJANET: I have waited so long. I will not let it go! (FX: SCREAM\nSTRETCHED: OUT)\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: She’s being pulled, stretched into the TARDIS. How’s that possible?\nPRASKA: The foul interloper. The infidel. You seek to steal the life of the great one. All you have taken will be ripped from you. If you hold onto it, then you will be spread across this dimension and his. And all the ones in between.\nJANET: (FX: SCREAMS, STRETCHED FX) I’1l take them with me! Hector... this ‘Doctor’! Anyone who stands in my way!\nHEX: (CRIES OUT) She’s got me!\nSALLY: Tommy! Take my hand! Here. I won’t let go. I won’t ever let you\nSALLY: go.\nACE: That’s the Doctor! What’s happening to him in there?\nPRASKA: His vessel. It has visited the realm of the gods. The Doctor explained. It tracks a course through this universe and all others. Everywhere it has been is connected to here and now. It can channel To’Koth’s life-force back to its point of origin.\nPRASKA: But the Doctor’s mind and his machine are linked. He is experiencing its agony.\nACE: He can’t be alone in there. I can’t let him go through it alone.\nSALLY: (CALLING) Go, Ace! I’ve got Hex. You go to the Doctor. He needs you! Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: INT.

I know what I’ve got to do. You look at me and you don’t stop. I’ve got you. I believe in you. I... love you.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: INT. VORTEX BETWEEN REALMS (CONTINUOUS)\nACE: Concentrate on me. I’m your friend.\nDOCTOR: (RECOVERING) Ace. You came to help me.\nACE: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere between the universes of mind and matter. Both are being blasted apart. Along with the TARDIS. I agreed to let To’Koth use it as an escape route back to the Elder Gods’ dominion. The alternative was.. well, the end of the world. All worlds.\nACE: Typical you. All about the grand noble gestures. (BEAT) Hex came back.\nDOCTOR: I know. But it took the near-destruction of everything to do it. I suppose he was worth it?\nACE: You bet.\nACE: (FX: SHIMMERING OF EVENTS OUTSIDE TARDIS: HEX AND SALLY’S CRIES\nINDISTINCT: )\nACE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Our reprieve is over. The barriers between dimensions are breaking down. We’re seeing shades and visions of now. Now and the future.\nACE: I can see.. Hex and Sally. She’s holding his hand. He’s out there now. Screaming in pain.\nDOCTOR: Look again.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 122\nACE: No it’s her in pain. She’s lying down...\nDOCTOR: He’s holding her hand.\nACE: White walls. In a room, with nurses? Hang on... This was Morgan’s dream. Her vision of the future.\nDOCTOR: A possible future.\nACE: She’s not dying, she’s... Oh my.. She’s having a baby! (BEAT) Professor, I am never, ever doing that.\nDOCTOR: The vision’s fading. (CALLING) Ace we’re about to get blown apart. You’ll see many strange things. Echoes of the future. The vortex is being turned inside out by To’Koth’s lifeforce...\nDOCTOR: TO’ KOTH: (DISTANT, FX) Doctor... Help me...\nACE: Is that him?\nDOCTOR: He needs my assistance on the final part of his journey.\nDOCTOR: I can’t promise we’ll make it out...\nACE: Don’t worry Doctor... I trust you!\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: EXT. DOCKS\nSALLY: Hex. Hex. Are you all right?\nHEX: Think so, Sal. Something else got hold of Ginny Greenteeth. Dragged her away. It was.. I think it was, the TARDIS.\nSALLY: Yeah. The last of her got sucked in, and the doors slammed. It’s just been standing there for the last half-hour. You did good work, Nurse Schofield. Be proud to have you in my unit.\nHEX: That your idea of recruitment policy? ‘Cos no way am I signing up for anything after that. (BEAT) Am I back? Am I really, really back? Cos. You know, looking up at you now. It could all be a dream.\nSALLY: If it is, I don’t want to wake up.\nSALLY: It’s getting light. I can’t believe we made it to another day.\nHEX: Me either. (BEAT) Hang on. Wasn’t there a seven-foot golden eagle standing there just now?\nSALLY: Yeah. She left. Beamed back up to her spaceship.\nHEX: Right. Course she did. (BEAT) Do you think we should try and get into the TARDIS?\nSALLY: Let’s see if there’s anyone at home.\nHEX: No answer. What now?\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 124\nSALLY: I don’t know. We just wait, I guess. (BEAT.

I should be able to restore the configuration if...\nDOCTOR: Ah, here’s her console. I suppose that’s what happens when the lifeforce of an Elder God rips through back to its home dimension.\nACE: Is that what happened? It worked?\nDOCTOR: I accompanied To’Koth on the last leg of the journey. Saw him returned to his own. They were grateful. Awestruck. You see, one of their kind has never died before.\nACE: You were there? And they let you come back?\nDOCTOR: You know what To’Koth did with his last breath? He called a truce. The Elder Gods and I have reached... not a concord exactly. An end of hostilities.\nACE: You mean, he was a goodie from the dawn of time?\nDOCTOR: Yes. First time for everything.

Course I’1ll never be able to afford the premiums again. But there is Mr Stone’s deposit to consider.\nSALLY: Enough for another aircraft-carrier, you said.\nGORMLEY: I lost a lot of good men out there. Nothing’s gonna pay for that.\nSALLY: And the people in Liverpool. How are they going to explain all that?\nGORMLEY: One for your UNIT mates. Not that they care too much about what happens up north.

It’s the missus.\nOLDER HEX: Bye McShane.\nACE: Better scarper before she catches us snogging. Don’t want to mess up fifteen years of wedded bliss. (FX: GOES OFF THROUGH\nTREES: )\nOLDER HEX: We’re not married- (CALLING AFTER) Ace! She told me what you did. Sticking by me. Thanks for that. Look after him, won’t you? (SOTTO) Look after each other.\nOLDER SALLY: (ARRIVING, WITH EFFORT) What was that? Tommy? I thought I heard-\nOLDER HEX: Yeah. Just ghosts. You should be resting.\nOLDER SALLY: Ghosts?\nOLDER HEX: Friendly ones. But ghosts all the same. (WALKING BACK TO HOUSE) Come on. I’m making pina coladas.\nOLDER SALLY: (FOLLOWING) No rum in mine.\nOLDER HEX: Course not. Not in your condition.\nOLDER SALLY: Come on. We’ll finish the birth plan. This time, straight to epidural. No messing. (STOPPING AT DOOR) It was them, wasn’t it? After all this time...\nOLDER HEX: Yeah. Don’t worry. I thought they wanted my help, but no, they’re fine saving the universe without me.\nOLDER SALLY: Good. Cos you’re mine, Tommy Schofield.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 134\nOLDER HEX: And you’re mine. We really did it, didn’t we?\nOLDER SALLY: Did what?\nOLDER HEX: We got away with our lives.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: INT. TARDIS, CONSOLE ROOM\nACE: Doctor. There’s something I’ve been wondering. Do you know when I die? How I die?\nDOCTOR: Ace, you've a universe of possibilities still ahead of you. Several universes. Did you... see anything? In your future flashes?\nACE: Lots of stuff. Me in a big collar and a cloak. Me on a moped. Riding through what looked like nineteenth century Paris. That can’t be right. Then me somewhere else. Surrounded by giant fleas.\nDOCTOR: Like I said, several universes.\nACE: How about you?\nDOCTOR: I heard... Puccini. Madam Butterfly.\nACE: That’s your big future revelation? You go to the opera.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure... Certainly a theatre of some kind. (FX: STARTS\nSETTING: CONTROLS. STOPS.) Actually. (BEAT) Why don’t you do the honours?\nACE: Really? (FX: SETTING CONTROLS) You know I could just grow old and die in the TARDIS. ‘Cos I told you — I’m not leaving. (FX:\nSTOPS: USING CONTROLS) You’d have to watch. (BEAT) That’s another thing I saw.\nDOCTOR: I would. But after everything I’ve put you through, that’s the least I could do.\nACE: I’m starting to get some of that famous big picture of yours. (BEAT) I’d do it all over again, you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: SIGNS ANND WONDERS (001) Page 136\nDOCTOR: I’ll bear that in mind. (BEAT) Don’t forget the spacial regulator.\nACE: (FX: FLICKS CONTROLS) Right. Destination set. (BEAT) You told me once there were places where the rivers dream.\nDOCTOR: I did, didn’t I?\nACE: Places where there’s danger, places there’s injustice. You’d better find a kettle and fire it up. (BEAT) Come on, Doctor — we’ve got work to do.\nACE: END"
