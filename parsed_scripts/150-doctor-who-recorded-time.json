Horrible, but not a mystery, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but where did they flee to? You see, the Sendosa had no access to spaceflight. They couldn’t leave.\nPERI: So they had time to build this fabled Armoury?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they converted an existing building. Perhaps it was built before the plague. I simply don’t know. The Armoury is a legend. A myth. And it’s hidden somewhere in the ruins of this city. Supposedly.\nPERI: Hidden?\nDOCTOR: Camouflaged. Discreet.

It doesn’t make sense.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A SOUND LIKE RUSHING WIND TINGED WITH AN ELECTRONIC BUZZ AS THE VOLSCI BEAM IN, RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOCTOR. )\nDOCTOR: Hello! Where did you two spring from?\nDOCTOR: VOLSCI 3: They appear to be unarmed.\nDOCTOR: Indeed, madam. All I have with me is my rapier wit.\nDOCTOR: VOLSCI 2: Restrain the male.\nPERI: Hey, leave him alone!\nPERI: VOLSCI 2: Males are proven to be more aggressive than females.\nDOCTOR: (GASPING) I take it, you’‘re the exception that proves the rule?\nDOCTOR: VOLSCI 3: Females are more practical than males.\nDOCTOR: Touché. Ugh.\nDOCTOR: VOLSCI 2: Take them to the Inquisa.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: EXT. ARMOURY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE INQUISA IS EXAMINING THE ARMOURY BUILDING WITH A SCANNER. IT MAKES A SONAR LIKE SOUND. )\nINQUISA: (INTO COMMS) There is a crystalline structure on the far side of the building. (FX: SHUTS OFF SCANNER) Scan reveals it is not an opening, but attached to the wall.\nCENTURIA: (D) Interesting. A locking mechanism?\nINQUISA: Possibly.\nCENTURIA: (D) But what could be the key?\nCENTURIA: (FX: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR, PERI AND THE VOLSCI APPROACH FROM OFF. )\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Ah, now this must be it! The Armoury of Sendos!\nPERI: What? That ugly, concrete thing?\nINQUISA: Centuria, the humanoid captives have arrived.\nCENTURIA: (D) Interrogate them, Inquisa. I want to hear what they have to say for themselves.\nCENTURIA: VOLSCI 2: (STOPPED) We have brought the prisoners, Inquisa.\nINQUISA: (TO DOCTOR) So I see. You know of this building, prisoners?\nDOCTOR: We've heard of it.\nINQUISA: If you have only heard of it, how do you know this is the correct building?\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: Because you ladies are gathered round it like wasps around a jammy jam jar. (BEAT) This is Sendos. The most important building is the Armoury. Ergo, you have a problem.\nPERI: Problem?\nDOCTOR: Why else would we be alive, Peri? The Volsci are nothing if not practical.\nINQUISA: You know of us?\nDOCTOR: A little. (BEAT) I note that you’re not refuting the fact that you have a problem-?\nINQUISA: We are nothing if not practical.\nDOCTOR: So I gather.\nPERI: The building — the Armoury — it’s... it’s shimmering.\nINQUISA: Some form of shielding technology. It seems to be linked to a crystalline structure on the building’s outer wall.\nDOCTOR: And there’s no door?\nINQUISA: Correct.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. That is sad. (TURNING TO LEAVE) Well, sorry, I wish I could help, but—\nPERI: (TO INQUISA) What are you doing to him?!? Stop it!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: VOLSCI 2: The Inquisa’s crown contains a mind probe. It is highly practical.\nPERI: Practical? She’s hurting him! Doctor!\nPERI: (FX: THE SOUND CUTS OFF. DOCTOR FALLS TO HIS KNEES, BREATHING HARD. )\nDOCTOR: Argh...\nPERI: Doctor? Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: Just about.\nINQUISA: Calm yourself, female. You disgrace your gender!\nPERI: Actually, I think you’re doing that!\nCENTURIA: (D) What does your mind analysis reveal, Inquisa?\nINQUISA: (D) One of the prisoners is a member of a race known as Time Lords. The method of entry to the Armoury is not in his mind. However, he has a time ship hidden nearby.\nCENTURIA: (D) Can we use this vehicle?\nINQUISA: It is apparently useless without its pilot’s biological presence.\nCENTURIA: (D) Bring the prisoners and their ship aboard the Kyal Yomofu (“KY-AL YO-MOW-FOO”). I have an alternative strategy in mind.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. VOLSCINE SHIP — CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DOCTOR AND PERI ARE BEING MARCHED DOWN A METALLIC CORRIDOR, ACCOMPANIED BY 2 x VOLSCI AND THE INQUISA)\nVOLSCI: Keep moving!\nDOCTOR: Wouldn’t dream of doing anything else! So this is the Kyal Yomofu. How.. utilitarian. (WHISPERING) Did you notice that the Armoury differed from the other buildings?\nPERI: (WHISPERING) Yeah. It looked like it had been built in a hurry.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERING) I thought so too.\nPERI: (WHISPERING) The other buildings were elegant — “Ultra- Classical”, remember? The Armoury was more like a concrete bunker than a coliseum!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERING) Very good, Peri. And exactly right.\nINQUISA: Halt!\nINQUISA: Guards, remain here. You two — proceed.\nPERI: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: You’re too kind.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. VOLSCINE SHIP — BRIDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nCENTURIA: (SWIVELLING IN CHAIR) Ah. The Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING TO STOP) Just “a” Time Lord, actually. Do try to use the proper article.\nINQUISA: He has adopted the title of “Doctor”, Centuria.\nCENTURIA: A Doctor...\nPERI: The Doctor.\nDOCTOR: There you are, you see? Peri has mastered it.\nCENTURIA: (IGNORING THIS) We have his time ship?\nINQUISA: Yes, Centuria. It has been taken to the engine chamber.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nCENTURIA: We will link your time ship to our own craft, Doctor. You will then pilot the conjoined vessels back in time to a point before the Armoury was built. Thus we will be able to acquire the weaponry without the need to enter the Armoury.\nDOCTOR: Very neat. But what makes you think that’s even possible? And even if it were, are you sure I’1ll comply? I mean, I’m a very accommodating sort of chap, but [when it comes to...]\nINQUISA: Mind analysis revealed he is susceptible to threats against his companion.\nCENTURIA: So, you will do as I say, Doctor, or the female will die.\nPERI: Oh great.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 13\nCENTURIA: We can then force the Sendosa to hand over their weapons.\nDOCTOR: (RELUCTANT) It would seem... (SIGHS) you leave me little choice.\nPERI: (SOTTO) Sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Not your fault, Peri.\nCENTURIA: Ship, prepare to embed alien technology into navigational systems.\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nDOCTOR: Voice control? How impressive.\nCENTURIA: It will not respond to your voice, Doctor, so forget any plans of hijack.\nDOCTOR: No, no. (OSTENTATIOUSLY) I assumed it would only work for the “su-Peri-or” female vocal range. (NUDGING PERI IN RIBS) Isn’t that right, Peri?\nPERI: Ow! Right. Right...\nCENTURIA: Ship, prepare to transport myself, the Inquisa and the Doctor directly to the engine chamber.\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nDOCTOR: Internal teleportation? It’s not that big a ship, why can’t we just walk?\nCENTURIA: It is practical. (CALLING OFF) Guards!\nCENTURIA: VOLSCI 2 & 3: (OFF) Yes, Centuria.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 14\nCENTURIA: The female will be detained here. You will destroy her, if the Doctor’s behaviour causes me to deem it necessary.\nCENTURIA: VOLSCI 2 & 3: (OFF) Yes, Centuria.\nCENTURIA: Ship, teleport... now.\nPERI: So it’s just us, then? All girls together? (BEAT) Well, are we just going to stare at each other or... are you allowed to talk to me?\nPERI: VOLSCI 2: Reason and dialogue are proof of higher evolution.\nPERI: Does that mean “yes”?\nPERI: VOLSCI 3: It does.\nPERI: Why?\nPERI: VOLSCI 3: You are female. All females are valid.\nPERI: Really? ‘Valid’? Mmm...\nPERI: VOLSCI 2: Males are reactionary, females are analytical.\nPERI: Well then, analyse this: Ship! Transport these two guards to the planet’s surface!\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nSHIP: VOLSCI 3: Ship, ignore— [that request]\nPERI: This instruction cannot be countermanded!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 15\nPERI: I am woman, hear me roar. Ship — return the Doctor here.\nSHIP: The male. Confirmed.\nPERI: Just him, mind! No-one else!\nDOCTOR: (BEAMING IN, BOUNDING FORWARD) Oh, well done, Peri! You picked up on my little hint, then-?\nPERI: “Su-Peri-or” female voice? Little?\nDOCTOR: Interesting that they’re so convinced of their feminine Superiority that it never occurred to them that a male anda female could work so well together.\nPERI: Are you trying to say we make a great team?\nDOCTOR: Naturally! Now, quickly! Tell the computer to block any further [transports —]\nPERI: OK, Ship—\nCENTURIA: I don’t think so, Doctor. Ship, remove the female Peri’s voice—\nPERI: No, wait— !\nINQUISA: Silence, girl!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: Leave her alone!!!\nINQUISA: You dare to command me?\nDOCTOR: All right, I’m sorry, but that’s enough!\nDOCTOR: (VERY CONCERNED) Peri... are you all right?\nPERI: (WEAKENED) I.. I am now, yeah, but... that was.. really horrible.\nCENTURIA: Ship — retrieve the guards from wherever the girl dispatched\nCENTURIA: them. Then return us all to the engine chamber.\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. VOLSCINE SHIP — ENGINE CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE ENGINES DRONE IN THE BACKGROUND. BEEPS AS THE DOCTOR WORKS ON A PANEL. )\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE WORKS) Power flow transmission seems constant now. Control circuits connected. Hmm...\nPERI: (SOTTO) Doctor... are you really going to do this?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I don’t see what choice we have.\nPERI: (SOTTO) But we can’t just give them what they want. And anyway, aren’t there rules against this kind of fooling around with time?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) More than I could easily quote just now, but—\nPERI: (SOTTO) Then we have to find a—\nPERI: Aaaaaaargh! (CONTINUES, UNDER)\nINQUISA: No more talking! Doctor, you are procrastinating!\nDOCTOR: No, I am not! Release Peri now! If you don’t, I’1l sever all the power connections! (ANGRY) Stop it! Now!\nDOCTOR: Peri... ? (TO INQUISA) I’ve agreed to your demands! This barbarity is unacceptable. Call yourselves superior?\nCENTURIA: Doctor! Have you identified a time period suitable to our needs — before the Armoury was built?\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR: (SULLEN) Yes.\nCENTURIA: Then operate the temporal link. Take us there. Or the Inquisa will cause more suffering to your friend.\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) Very well.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORE BEEPS AS THE DOCTOR OPERATES THE TEMPORAL LINK. THE TARDIS ENGINES SOUND, DISTORTED. )\nINQUISA: (OVER THE DIN) Is it working?\nCENTURIA: (OVER THE DIN) Well, Doctor?\nPERI: It’s worked, then.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We’ve arrived. We’re still in orbit, but we’ve moved into the past.\nCENTURIA: Ship, scan the planet.\nSHIP: The planet has a communication network suitable for interruption. It also possesses shielding technology similar to that identified on the Armoury.\nCENTURIA: Broadcast the following message to the Sendosa government.\nCENTURIA: We of the Volscine Imperia greet the government of Sendos. We know that you have plans to construct weapons of incredible destructive capability. We ask that you share those plans with us. We do not seek to overthrow or destroy you. We only seek to gain your knowledge. Once we have achieved this, we will then depart. You should reply immediately or face the consequences.\nDOCTOR: Not what you’d called a veiled threat, was it? And what if they reject your proposal?\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 19\nCENTURIA: Why should they?\nDOCTOR: They might not agree with your definition of practicality.\nSHIP: No response.\nPERI: What? You can’t mean—\nCENTURIA: Ship, energize and focus particle bombardment batteries.\nDOCTOR: (TAKEN ABACK) Be reasonable, it’s only been a few seconds.\nPERI: You haven’t given them any time to answer you!\nCENTURIA: Commence particle bombardment.\nPERI: No!\nPERI: (FX: THE SHIP RUMBLES AS THE VOLSCINE PARTICLE WEAPONS OPEN FIRE. )\nSHIP: The particle weapons are being deflected by an energy shield.\nDOCTOR: What a pity for you.\nCENTURIA: Damage is not necessary at this point.\nPERI: At this point?\nSHIP: Incoming transmission from the planet surface.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 20\nBAROND: This is Drar Barond. I am Prime Minister of the Sendosa sphere. I greet the representative of the Volscine Imperia and offer our hospitality. (BEAT) I assure you of our peaceful nature. We neither mean you harm nor have the ability to inflict it. We... we are not... not a perfect race... but we do not possess any weaponry that might be deemed to have “incredible destructive capability”. You are mistaken in your belief about these... these plans you think we have made. I would, however, be delighted for a delegation of our government — (to meet with any representation of the Volscine Imperia...)\nCENTURIA: Do you think I don’t recognise stalling tactics when I hear them? This is a sham. A performance.\nBAROND: (RADIO FILTER) No.. no, I assure you—\nCENTURIA: Unless you produce the plans for your weapons, we will be forced to increase the level of our attack and penetrate your energy shield.\nBAROND: Please... We.. we do have weapons... projectile weapons, but they are by no means comparable — (to the weapons you)\nCENTURIA: Ship, curtail communication.\nDOCTOR: He sounded sincere to me.\nCENTURIA: If that is the case, then why does their city possess a shield capable of deflecting energy weapons?\nPERI: Perhaps because they’re more concerned with protecting their people than destroying others?\nINQUISA: (TO CENTURIA) Increasing the energy levels of our attack may prove time consuming and costly, Centuria. There is, however... (WITH SOME PLEASURE) another solution.\nCENTURIA: Ah yes... Ship, prepare the “Abdima Device”. (AB-DEE-MAR)\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: “Abdima” ?\nPERI: I don’t like the sound of that.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nCENTURIA: Let us say that this will both overcome the issue of penetrating their shields and give us the upper hand in one manoeuvre.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Hold on, Peri.\nSHIP: Now preparing Abdima device.\nDOCTOR: (WITH EFFORT AS HE WRENCHES CONTROLS) I’m sorry. I cannot allow that.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE TARDIS ENGINES ENGAGE. THE VOLSCINE SHIP VIBRATES ALARMINGLY. )\nINQUISA: (FALLING OVER) Aargh! What have you done, Doctor!?!\nINQUISA: (FX: AN ALARM SOUNDS URGENTLY. THE CHARACTERS HAVE TO SHOUT OVER THE TOP OF THIS.)\nCENTURIA: (OUTRAGED, DEFIANT) Ship! Launch the device!\nPERI: No, you can’t!\nSHIP: Abdima device launched.\nDOCTOR: Whatever you unleash, it will do you no good. I have induced a dimensional mis-phase in your engines. (BEAT) This ship is going to crash, Centuria!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 22\nSHIP: Emergency landing imminent.\nCENTURIA: Fire all landing rockets immediately!\nSHIP: Landing rockets firing.\nSHIP: (FX: BLAST OF ROCKETS, MUFFLED BY HULL. THE WHINE OF THE ENGINE DECREASES. )\nDOCTOR: (EDIT OVER SHIP AND CENTURIA’S PRECEDING LINES. CLOSE AND INTENSE) Peri! Listen to me!\nPERI: (CLOSE AND INTENSE) Shouldn’t we just get in the TARDIS and go?\nDOCTOR: (A REALIZATION MOMENT) Of course!\nPERI: ‘Of course’ what?\nDOCTOR: Listen! This ship is going to crash now... It’s just going to be a bumpy landing.\nPERI: So?\nDOCTOR: So I have a plan! And this is your moment in history, Peri.\nPERI: My moment... ?\nDOCTOR: Yes.. I’ve worked out what the Abdima device is. So, this is what you’ve got to do!\nDOCTOR: (CUT TO EXTERIOR AS THE SHIP CRASH-LANDS IN ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION.

Come on, you must be able to hear me!\nSHIP: (VOICE WINDS UP) The Kyal Yomofu has crashed on Sendos.\nPERI: Yeah... I know, and the crew are in the engine room. Listen, I know my voice is no longer in the command database, but—\nSHIP: Your voice was not removed. The command to remove your voice was not completed. You are female, you are valid.\nPERI: Oh... okay. But I don’t want to give you a command, I want to give you a warning.\nSHIP: A warning?\nPERI: For the people of Sendos.\nSHIP: I do not understand.\nPERI: You can broadcast it — like you did just now for the Centuria.\nSHIP: Broadcast.\nPERI: Yes. Please! Record and Broadcast this message (BEAT) Um... Ok... I’ve been asked to record a message to help you. We are prisoners of the alien race attacking the Sendosa. They have come to find an Armoury of super weapons. We need you to escape from the plague using this ship. The ship is voice activated. Just tell it what to do and it should do as you say. Good Luck!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 24\nSHIP: It is done.\nPERI: Good. Oh... and actually... er.. I do have some commands!\nSHIP: Please go ahead.\nPERI: From now on, you will accept voice commands from males as well as females.\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nPERI: And... is there a main door on the ship’s hull? You know, to let people in?\nSHIP: There is.\nPERI: Okay, well... open it, please. And that order cannot be countermanded by anyone, okay?\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. VOLSCINE SHIP — ENGINE CHAMBER\nINQUISA: The main door is opening!\nCENTURIA: But the Abdima device will have activated it!\nINQUISA: This is your doing, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (IN PAIN) Argh! Please! Stop! Listen... to... me!\nCENTURIA: Release him.\nCENTURIA: What do you have to say?\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS) The Kyal Yomofu will need time to re-configure her engines. If you need to leave right away—\nCENTURIA: We must leave now!!!\nDOCTOR: All right, then you’1ll have to go in the TARDIS.\nINQUISA: It is small. Will there be room for ten Volsci plus you?\nDOCTOR: (STILL RECOVERING) It has hidden depths. (BEAT) And you are forgetting Peri.\nINQUISA: But we cannot leave this time period until we have secured the weapons.\nCENTURIA: It is not safe for us to stay here now! Not now the Abdima device is activated!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Oh, don’t worry, I think I’ve worked out how you can open the Armoury back in the future.\nCENTURIA: What? Tell us!\nDOCTOR: Not until we have all returned to our proper time and place. I cannot conscience any more temporal meddling.\nCENTURIA: (CONSIDERING) Very well. Ship! Find the female. Transport her and all Volsci here at once.\nSHIP: Confirmed.\nSHIP: (FX: THE VOLSCI TRANSPORTER BEAMS IN PERI AND THE VOLSCI TROOPS. )\nDOCTOR: Is everything all right, Peri?\nPERI: I think it will be...\nCENTURIA: You will use your time ship to pilot the Volscine forces to safety. You will not deviate or we will—\nDOCTOR: Yes, all right, all right! No need for any more of your tiresome threats. Into the TARDIS, everyone. Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: B/G HUM. A DOZEN VOLSCI ARE MILLING ABOUT.

I don’t want Bolshie Volsci in the skirting board, thank you!\nPERI: (CLOSE, WHISPERING, URGENT) What’s your plan now?\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) It was you who opened the doors?\nPERI: (CLOSE) Yeah, turns out my voice hadn’t been erased from the ship’s database after all.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Well done. And you sent the message?\nPERI: (CLOSE) I hope I got it right.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m sure you did.\nDOCTOR: Anything like this... ?\nVOICE: . record a message... We are.. the Sendosa.. come to find an Armoury of super weapons... we.. escape from the plague... It is...\nVOICE: Just... Good luck...\nPERI: Yes! It’s a broken version of my message!\nCENTURIA: This recording. The female. The voice pattern is identical.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem...\nINQUISA: What does this mean?\nDOCTOR: Er.. Shall we find out?\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. ARMOURY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE TARDIS MATERIALISES AND THE DOOR OPENS. OUT STEP THE DOCTOR AND PERI FOLOWED BY THE VOLSCI. THE TROOPS ARE CARRYING SUPPLIES, HEAVY WEAPONS, ETC.)\nDOCTOR: There we are. Landed right inside the force-field.\nCENTURIA: You will tell us your theory now.\nDOCTOR: I believe that the crystal formation on the wall, there, is a locking mechanism.\nINQUISA: I surmised that. But what is the key?\nDOCTOR: I see you’re carrying some heavy weaponry.\nCENTURIA: We have two particle cannon.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then you simply set one of them up and fire it at the crystal.\nINQUISA: That will destroy the lock! Is this another of your tricks, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe so.\nINQUISA: I could take the truth from your mind.\nDOCTOR: You know I know that. So why would I lie?\nCENTURIA: Very well. Set up the cannon!\nCENTURIA: VOLSCI 1: Yes, Ma’am.\nCENTURIA: (FX: THERE IS THE MECHANICAL SOUND OF A LARGE WEAPON BEING SET UP AND PREPPED FOR FIRING. )\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 29\nCENTURIA: Fire when ready.\nCENTURIA: Nothing. It hasn’t worked!\nINQUISA: (ANGRILY) I will dissolve your mind...\nDOCTOR: Patience! The Armoury has not been opened for a very long time.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SURE ENOUGH, THERE IS A GRINDING AS THE WALL SEPEATES IN TWO, REVEALING A GAP.)\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) There! You see? Just large enough for us to enter Single file. (SETTING OFF) Shall we? Come along, Peri!\nINQUISA: We should kill them both.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OVER HIS SHOULDER) You’1ll need a guide. There could be traps. Danger. I’ve mastered the Dark Tower of the Death Zone on Gallifrey! Solved the riddles posed by the Cybermen’s Tomb on Telos! Survived the city of the Exxilons! You couldn’t find a better scout than I!\nCENTURIA: (WITH DISDAIN) Cyber-men! (BEAT, THEN HARD) You and your companion will go first. We will follow with the squad. Any deviation... Any artifice.. We will kill you immediately. Is that clear?\nDOCTOR: (STILL SOME DISTANCE AWAY) As the crystal of this opening mechanism! (BEAT) However, it looks quite obscure in there! Do we have any torches?\nCENTURIA: Bring the glow-tubes. And monitor this building. If there is weaponry there may be defence mechanisms — as the Doctor says.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. ARMOURY — PASSAGEWAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FOOTSTEPS OF THE GROUP SCUFF AND ECHO. SUDDENLY, THE SOUND OF A PAVING STONE GRINDING AND A HISS OF AIR.)\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nCENTURIA: What?\nDOCTOR: Someone’s trodden on a hidden pressure pad.\nINQUISA: A trap!\nDOCTOR: Let’s see, shall we?\nDOCTOR: (FX: A BUZZING SOUND AS AN ADDRESS SYSTEM COMES TO LIFE AFTER MILLENNIA. IT IS VERY LIKE PERI’S VOICE, BUT A BIT DISJOINTED. )\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: This is the Armoury of Sendos. Welcome, traveller.\nCENTURIA: What is this?\nPERI: My voice. Again.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like they sampled and recreated it.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: For countless ages the Sendosa civilisation developed without contact from the rest of the galaxy. Then, suddenly, death came from the skies. This is the story of our legacy to the universe. (BEAT) You must travel to the heart of the Armoury to complete your destiny.\nPERI: Bit like a creepy theme park experience.\nDOCTOR: Creepy and distinctly dangerous, I imagine.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 31\nCENTURIA: Lead on, Doctor.\nINQUISA: And the girl. If there is any danger, they will face it first.\nPERI: (SOTTO) Doctor... the Sendosa built the Armoury because their race died from a terrible plague that came from space.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Yes, Peri. Ring any bells?\nPERI: (SOTTO) You mean... The weapon the Volsci used!\nCENTURIA: Has it detected something?\nVOLSCI: There is a power source at the centre of the structure.\nCENTURIA: The power source must be for the weapons.\nDOCTOR: Think for a moment, Centuria. You wanted to get off this planet the moment the main door of the Kyal Yomofu opened. Is that because the Abdima device was a biological weapon?\nCENTURIA: The Abdima device releases an airborne contagion that attacks the nervous system of all mammalian life forms. The spread of the disease is swift.\nPERI: (AGHAST) So it was you. You killed the Sendosa.\nDOCTOR: Just to satisfy your lust for a greater collection of bigger and better weaponry!\nCENTURIA: (DETERMINED) And now we shall claim that weaponry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And is that all that matters to you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 32\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: Unbidden and unexpected, aliens arrived on our world making demands that the Sendosa could not answer.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: PERI (APPALLED AS HER FEARS ARE CONFIRMED) We did this.\nDOCTOR: No, Peri. The Volsci did this. They used us.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: The aliens then unleashed a terrible pestilence. Destruction seemed inevitable. Even as the peoples of Sendos died in their millions, they undertook the great labour of building this Armoury.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: (FX: SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION. MACHINERY, DRILLING, PEOPLE CALLING TO ONE ANOTHER, ETC. )\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: The Plague took mere weeks for it to consume those it afflicted. But the sick were united in this cause. By the time the construction was completed, all but a handful were dead. (BEAT) Aliens had brought about the annihilation of our civilisation.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: (FX: THE AUDIO TRACK CRACKLES TO A STOP ONCE MORE. THEY ALL CONTINUE DOWN THE PASSAGE. )\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see, Centuria? You have created a temporal paradox of unfathomable depth. Why not show some true wisdom and leave now. I could take you home and—\nCENTURIA: Silence.\nCENTURIA: VOLSCI 2: Centuria. The power source is very close. It is... familiar.\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: Salvation came from the most miraculous of sources. A voice was\nSENDOSA COMPUTER: heard summoning those that could to a space craft.\nPERI: That was me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: Your voice must have seemed like the voice of a saviour.\nINQUISA: So the Sendosa built the Armoury to house their weapons because we gave them the idea.\nDOCTOR: More than that.. The question is why did they beam your message out into space as a beacon?\nCENURIA: The message tells of the Armoury. It is a challenge.\nDOCTOR: Is it? Think about it for just a moment.\nDOCTOR: VOLSCI 1: The power source lies on the other side of these doors.\nCENTURIA: At last.\nINQUISA: The weapons are within our grasp.\nDOCTOR: Don’t open those doors! Please! Wait! Think! What opened the Armoury?\nCENTURIA: A gun.\nDOCTOR: A Volscine gun. The locking mechanism was tuned to the Volsci’s weapons’ Signature.\nPERI: So the Sendosa recorded the Volscine weapons’ signature and used that as the key to the Armoury.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Only the Volsci would be able to open the Armoury.\nINQUISA: Stop your chattering. Centuria, shall I kill them now?\nCENTURIA: (IMPATIENT) Open the doors!\nDOCTOR WHO: PARADOXICIDE by Richard Dinnick (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TWO VOLSCI OPEN THE HEAVY DOORS. THE VOLSCI SCANNER FINALLY HAS A CLEAR READING OF THE POWER SOURCE. )\nDOCTOR WHO: VOLCSI 1: The energy patterns!

It appears the plague gas was contained within the Armoury.\nPERI: So the Sendosa built the Armoury as a trap for the Volsci.\nDOCTOR: Yes. They knew what the Volsci came here for, so they made sure they gave it to them. Fatally.\nPERI: But some Sendosa must have escaped in the Volsci ship.\nDOCTOR: It would seem so... beaming your message out into space to create the myth of the armoury.\nPERI: So.. even though the Volsci forced us to create a time paradox which almost wiped the Sendosa out... We were kind of responsible for saving the Sendosa too.\nDOCTOR: And you and your message played a vitally important part in that.\nPERI: (PLEASED) You think so?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, Peri.

I confess, such a sum would not go amiss. (FX: PRODUCING LETTER) Tilly — I didn’t tell you. After the ball, he left me a letter.\nTILLY: (GASPS) Dearest sister! How could you keep this from me?

But can such a lowly family be a Suitable match for one of your lofty status?\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/DARCY As I say, Doctor, Miss Brown has fostered unfamiliar feelings in me.\nDOCTOR: Please. Don’t let me keep you. I have a mission of my own. We shall see whom fortune favours.\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/DARCY Indeed we shall, Doctor. Ha!\nDOCTOR: What an unconscionably arrogant fellow.

Both amused and bemused, I'd say.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/DARCY\nPERI: I fear my pride belies my true inclination. It seems there is none with whom I would rather dance than the one who refuses my hand.\nPERI: In that, I suspect we are kindred spirits.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/DARCY You have seen my letter.\nPERI: It appears we have misjudged you. I, more than most. (BEAT) Did you have something to ask me, Mr Darcy?\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: MINDSMITH/DARCY A woman of such perspicacity would no doubt be aware of my question already.\nPERI: And a man of such certainty would be aware of my answer.

Spirit. And many other qualities... which are not unattractive. I am here to request your hand. In marriage.\nPERI: Doctor Smith! I did not realise you had... intentions. I’m flattered by your interest, but I cannot accept.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know it’s usual practice to reject the first application, but to save time —\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/DARCY The lady has given her answer, sir.\nDOCTOR: Miss Brown and I have an acquaintance a long time in the forging, Mr Darcy.

Are you listening to me?\nCRANTON: (D) Doctor! How’d you get on?\nDOCTOR: Well, we’ve tried it your way, and failed.\nCRANTON: (D) You were the one who wanted to go barging in after her. I just suggested it’d be worth playing along to try and ease her mind out gently.\nDOCTOR: Well, it wasn’t. Peri is totally immersed in the fiction. Didn’t recognise me at all. Typical Peri, she wanders off on her own and ends up falling for the sales patter of some sideshow huckster shilling the rubes with highly suspect technology!\nCRANTON: (D) Hold up, Doctor. I’m hardly small-scale.\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 11\nCRANTON: This the 2351 Galaxy Fair. It’s not like anyone can roll up and grab a pitch. Cost me a pretty penny to be here.\nDOCTOR: (VIA COMLINK) Well, you’re charging more than a pretty penny for your services. (DISDAINFULLY) The Austen Experience. Believe me, Jane would not approve. Your brochure says ‘other nineteenth century novelists are available.’ What else have you got in here?\nCRANTON: Eliot, Thackeray... a Bronté or two. Bit depressing, mind. Don’t get much call for it. Austen’s far and away the favourite. Ironic really. The idle rich spending their leisure credits to play at being the idle rich.\nDOCTOR: (D) Well, it’s not exactly faithful to the book.\nCRANTON: Scenarios are based on characters, events and my ladies’ own... proclivities. To be honest, most of ‘em just want to flirt with Mr D.\nDOCTOR: (D) And you’re absolutely certain nothing like this has happened before?\nCRANTON: Absolutely. Your young lady’s completely out for the count. Practically comatose. A few gents have offered me a tidy sum to keep their missus under. Deliberate, like.\nDOCTOR: (D) Which you refused, I hope?\nCRANTON: Of course. I mean, eventually. One fella wanted me to hang on to his old lady for the rest of her natural. I says no way. No more than a couple of weeks. A month tops. Maybe two. What do you take me for?\nDOCTOR: (D) Do you really want me to answer that?\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR: (INTO COMLINK) No, there’s something else going on here. I need to access the processor.\nCRANTON: (D) Hold your ‘orses. This is highly specialised technical stuff. I can’t let any old punter mess around with it.\nDOCTOR: You should know by now, Cranton, I am far from being ‘any old punter’. I can tell you that this psychic-landscape is maintained by a trans-neural damping field with psycho-neutrino stabilisers. Which means there must be an A.I. processing and feeding back the data. And I need access to it. Now.\nCRANTON: (D) OK, OK. You want the Trans-neural Logical Interface. In its native format. Hang on a mo, I’1l1 sort it for you.\nDOCTOR: Just hurry it up, would you?\nTILLY: Doctor Smith. I am so sorry for your disappointment.\nDOCTOR: (TURNING) Now where did you spring from?

Patched up those boys best I could, but they were never the same once the Mindsmiths had been at ‘em. Took their souls.\nDOCTOR: A dirty little war, as I recall. The Mindsmiths lost. Askertan was reduced to a burned-out wasteland.\nCRANTON: I know. I helped mop up.\nDOCTOR: Only you ‘mopped up’ a datacore.

In this nineteenth-century world, marriage entails ownership of a lady’s entire person. It marries Peri in here: it takes her mind in the real world.

Just get him out.\nCRANTON: It’d cause permanent brain damage even if I could pull him out now. Which I can’t.

Your estates of Netherfield and Donwell are forfeit. As is the House of Tardis, and Lordship of... Time. (BEAT) Tardis, would that be up by Ilkley?\nDOCTOR: (WEAK & DISTRACTED) These properties have been with me for so long.. I can’t help feeling there’s something I’m forgetting...\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Just so long as you remember your name, you can make your mark here. And all will be mine.\nPERI: I wouldn’t sign anything if I were you Doctor...\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Miss Brown, we have no need of you here. A mere woman has little understanding of these matters.\nPERI: This ‘mere woman’ understands enough to know those deeds aren’t worth the virtual paper they’re written on.\nDOCTOR: Miss Brown... Peri...?\nPERI: Shame on you, Doctor. Conning poor Mr Heathcliff into thinking you’re a man of means. When we both know the truth.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF (QUIETLY) No...\nPERI: And Mr Heathcliff, don’t you think you should find out a little more about a girl before you go proposing? Like where I met Mrs Brown, maybe?\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF (UNSURE) In the colonies, I understood. You were an orphan and she... she...\nPERI: Missing a little backstory, huh? Well let me fill you in. Mrs Brown took me on in Virginia, to be precise. But not just as her ward. As her apprentice. Only I knew her as Moll. Moll Flanders. And she taught me everything I needed to know about finding a mark and fleecing him of every last dime.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF (LOUDER) No.\nPERI: And the Doctor, as you know, is a gambler. A risk-taker and habitual thrill-seeker. Oh, he might appear the upright pillar of society, but anyone who knows him at all can tell you he has a much more... questionable lifestyle.\nPERI: Here are the deeds to his properties, and the key to his manor.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Silence! To the devil with your clamour!\nPERI: Here’s your key, Doctor. Your-\nDOCTOR: TARDIS key! Mr Heathcliff, I’m afraid it’s true. I have been less than candid with you...\nPERI: You see, Heathcliff, you can’t win the Doctor’s property. He already lost it. To me.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Had I been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of you two...\nPERI: Nice. And before you get any other ideas, Heathcliff, Darcy — whatever your name is — the engagement’s off.\nDOCTOR: You can quote all the borrowed threats you like, Mindsmith. You’ve lost your power over us. (SOTTO) For now at any rate.\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF But yet, you both remain. Have a care Doctor, Miss Brown. You shall not quit this place till my wishes are fulfilled.\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 33\nPERI: That’1ll be mother.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF I understood Mrs Brown was... indisposed?\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter, Mindsmith? Losing track of your minor characters?\nTILLY: Peri, it’s Mamma. I’ve never seen her so agitated.\nTILLY: Mr Heathcliff, she is most eager to speak with you. She says to tell you, you may hear something to your advantage.\nTILLY: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF (SOTTO) A new mind. One with power...\nTILLY: Dr Smith, Mamma is close to the end.\nDOCTOR: I shall be there presently, Tilly. I just need a moment with your sister.\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF\nDOCTOR: (LEAVING WITH TILLY) Make haste, Doctor, Peri, if you wish to say your farewells. Miss Tilly, direct me to your mother’s chamber.\nDOCTOR: So, you can take the girl out of Baltimore — and, it seems, you can also take Baltimore out of the girl! Welcome back, Peri!\nPERI: You too, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Daniel Defoe — an earthy but inspired selection. A near enough fit that the Mindsmith overlooked your rewriting of history. Miss Brown, I have to admit: I’m impressed.\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 34\nPERI: Now I know you’re not yourself.\nDOCTOR: Fair’s fair! You have saved my mind from oblivion and for that, the universe and I are extremely grateful. (BEAT) Although... was it absolutely necessary to besmirch my good name quite so much? Habitual thrill-seeker? Questionable lifestyle?\nPERI: Just think of it as... dramatic licence.\nDOCTOR: Well, I hope you’ve thought out your next move very carefully. Where next? To meet Moll Flanders, I presume?\nPERI: Yep. Cranton’s opened a maintenance window to disable the Mindsmith. Just wait till you get a load of the next chapter.\nDOCTOR: Peri, our minds are in a very precarious position. The Mindsmith may be limited by the scenario in which it’s forced to exist, but we are still trapped in its domain. We do not want to provoke it!\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 35\nTILLY: Mother? I have Mr Heathcliff with me.\nTILLY: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN)\nTILLY: (ATTEMPTING AN OLD WOMAN’S VOICE, BADLY) Tilly, my dear. Oh, and Mr Heathcliff, too. Step forward, sir, so I may look at you.\nTILLY: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Mrs Brown? Forgive me, I didn’t realise you were... awake, else I’d have paid my respects sooner.\nTILLY: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) Don’t you worry, sir. I am not long for this world. (SOTTO — AS HIMSELF) About two minutes to be precise.\nTILLY: Oh Mamma, no!\nTILLY: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) Be strong, my dear, there are things you need to hear before I go. You and Mr Heathcliff. Is the Doctor here? And Peri?\nDOCTOR: We’re here... ‘Mrs Brown’.\nPERI: Mother.\nPERI: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) Come closer, Dr Smith. I have some letters. Under my pillow.\nDOCTOR: Lean forward, madam. (SOTTO) I do hope you know what you’re doing, Cranton. You’ve singularly failed to inspire my confidence so far.\nCRANTON: (SOTTO — AS HIMSELF) I’ve got maintenance access for another ninety seconds. I’1l disable our friend, then I’m out and you two should be able to follow. Just play along.\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) I have the papers.\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN)\nDOCTOR WHO: Here, Mr Heathcliff, you will find some correspondence between myself and your guardian, Mr Earnshaw. Along with his last will and testament.\nDOCTOR WHO: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF You said I would hear something to my advantage...\nDOCTOR WHO: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) Actually, I said you ‘may’. Then again, you may not.\nDOCTOR WHO: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF What is this charade?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN)\nDOCTOR WHO: You see, only now dare I own who I have been as well as who I am.. You may know of Moll Flanders by reputation. Late of the colonies, funds were low. So my ward and I set sail for England, to embark once more upon my Criminal Career of Deception and Debauchery.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) All right, don’t build up your part.\nDOCTOR: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN)\nDOCTOR: In short, Mr Earnshaw and I were married, and I bore him another heir. His favoured child. As an attractive widow, I did not remain alone in my grief for long. I wed General Tilney soon after, he too was generous enough to change his will.\nDOCTOR: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Tilney? Of Northanger Abbey?\nPERI: Then there was old Mr Darcy of Pemberley.\nPERI: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) One o’mine.\nPERI: Mr Rochester of Thornfield Hall.\nPERI: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) And ‘im. State of that attic!\nDOCTOR: Sir Walter Elliot? Took very little ‘Persuasion’.\nDOCTOR: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) Indeed. ‘Ad ‘im twice!\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Enough! So you claim my estates are not my own? If you were not at death’s door I’d throttle you myself...\nDOCTOR WHO: CRANTON (AS MRS BROWN) And with my dying breath, I bequeath all of my properties to... my dearest daughter Tilly. (SIGHS)\nTILLY: Mamma! No! (SOBS)\nPERI: Tilly, I’m sorry. She’s gone. As for you, ‘Heathcliff’ — you now have nothing, you own nothing and so you are nothing in this world. Even your name’s stolen.\nPERI: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF Then so shall you all come to nothing. (FX: DEEP ALIEN VOICE) Initiate datacore wipe.\nPERI: Doctor, Cranton’s out — shouldn’t we be too?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was rather afraid there’d be a twist in the tale. This is Mindsmith technology after all. It’s rebooting the core. Wiping the entire psych-scape. Our minds included.\nPERI: Isn’t there anything we can do?\nDOCTOR: Not we. But...\nDOCTOR: TILLY/T.L.1I. (COMMANDING) Excuse me, Mr Heathcliff. (BECOMING COLD, COMPUTER-LIKE) I think you’1ll find I am mistress of this house.\nPERI: Way to go sister!\nPERI: T.L.I. Release psych-scape connections.\nDOCTOR: Tilly! Just let me- (FX: TWO ELECTRONIC PHUTS)\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 38\nTILLY: Goodbye, Doctor, and sister Peri.

But you have never felt the heat of my passion till now.\nTILLY: MINDSMITH/HEATHCLIFF\nTILLY: The fire.. (COUGHING) How quickly it spreads. The door... Help me. (TILLY EMBRACES MINDSMITH) What? What are you doing? Unhand me, girl!\nTILLY: Rochester escaped these flames — but you shall not. Feel them! They forge our fates together!

The whole thing, burned out!\nDOCTOR: A good thing too.\nPERI: Poor Tilly,\nCRANTON: It was just an A.I.\nDOCTOR: Just an A.I.? I’ll have you know, Tilly saved both Peri’s mind and mine.\nPERI: Isn’t there anything we can do, Doctor? She seemed so real.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Peri. The datacore is just a lump of silicon now. There’s nothing left.\nCRANTON: What am I gonna do?\nDOCTOR: Well, I think we’ve ruled out a career on the stage. Might I suggest you try working for a living? You’re not without skills. It took some technical genius to do what you did. Even if the parts were stolen.\nCRANTON: Thanks, Doctor. Miss Brown. I'll, er.. see what comes up.\nDOCTOR WHO: A MOST EXCELLENT MATCH by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND PERI WALKING THROUGH DOOR INTO BUSTLING CROWD ATMOS)\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) ‘To live in a perfectly new manner, if — in short, if anything turns up.’ He really should have had some Dickens in there, you know.\nPERI: (STOPPING) You’re not gonna let him get away with it, are you? Cranton, I mean?\nDOCTOR: I like to think that I’m some judge of character, Peri.\nPERI: Well, you have always had ‘the highest regard for my spirit’!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes. (STOPPING.

I’m scared too.\nDESTINY: I’m not scared.\nPERI: Yeah, well — you’re on the right side of the gun. (BEAT) Captain, please. Two people with amnesia — that’s more than a coincidence, don’t you think?

But as for what this place is, or who we are-\nSTONE: One thing at a time, lad. One thing at a time. (MUSING) These cables here.

I don’t know how I’m going to save everyone otherwise.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: You’re not alone you know.\nDESTINY: Really? This badge says I’m the Captain. That means it’s my responsibility to get us all home, safe. Wherever home is.\nDOCTOR: Come on. The generator’s this way.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 21\nMCALLISTER: I’m getting no joy from here. I’1ll have to go to the communications room.\nPERI: Where’s that?\nMCALLISTER: According to the schematic — down the corridor and up a bit.\nSTONE: Damn it. I can’t get anything on this.\nPERI: (SOTTO, TO MCALLISTER) Don’t leave me with old grumpy there.\nMCALLISTER: Sorry. I’ll be quick. (EXITS)\nPERI: What’s up, Mr Stone?\nSTONE: I’m finding only internal sensors. No indication of what’s outside. (BEAT; REALISATION) Of course-!\nPERI: Of course what? What’s the graph mean?\nSTONE: It’s telling me a wave of energy passed through the ship about twenty minutes ago.\nPERI: What? Is that what wiped our memories?\nSTONE: Well, it can’t be a concidence, can it?!? But it still doesn’t tell me what’s outside.\nPERI: I was thinking: if we’re in space, why’s it so hot?\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 22\nSTONE: We could be drifting into a star for all we know. If only we could see out.\nPERI: There’s a great metal hatch in the ceiling. For all we know, it’s covering a porthole.\nSTONE: (PATRONISINGLY) Don’t you mean a viewport-?\nPERI: I.. I'll just go and see how Arnie’s getting on.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 23\nDESTINY: (WALKING UP) Is this it, Question Marks?\nDOCTOR: One shield generator, yes.\nDESTINY: Should all that wiring be exposed like that?\nDOCTOR: I shouldn’t think so. Look, there are bits of it missing!\nDESTINY: Sabotage?\nDOCTOR: Done a hurry, certainly, judging by the way these circuits have been left hanging. Mindless vandalism!\nDESTINY: It wasn’t random. These wires have been deliberately cut, see?\nDOCTOR: So they have.\nDESTINY: . and I’ve seen this kind of circuit before.\nDOCTOR: You have? Where?\nDESTINY: In your pocket. Have you still got it?\nDOCTOR: Here. I’m sure these things are universal. It could have come from anything.\nDESTINY: Then why does your circuit fit perfectly into this recess?\nDOCTOR: I... can’t explain.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 24\nDESTINY: Even the cut wires match up.\nDOCTOR: Why would I sabotage the shields? And where are the other missing circuits?\nDESTINY: I don’t know. But whether you remember or not is irrelevant. This “mindless vandalism” was done by you!\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL)\nPERI: (OFF) Arnie? Are you there?\nMCALLISTER: Up here!\nPERI: (ENTERING) Hi.\nMCALLISTER: Come to keep me company?\nPERI: I’m not sure Mr Stone likes me very much.\nMCALLISTER: Well, I like you. (AWKWARD LAUGH)\nPERI: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Any luck?\nMCALLISTER: I’ve got a channel open, but the screen’s just fuzz.\nPERI: Page 25\nPERI: Stone thinks some sort of energy wave might have wiped our\nPERI: memories.\nMCALLISTER: Guess if we’ve worked out the cause, we can find the cure.\nPERI: I hope so. I don’t want to be known only as Mystery Woman for the rest of my days. I’d like my old life back now, thanks.\nMCALLISTER: I wonder what we were like? In our old lives, our ordinary\nMCALLISTER: remembering lives?\nPERI: Maybe we hated each other.\nMCALLISTER: Or maybe we were...\nPERI: . were what?\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 26\nMCALLISTER: You [know] — (BREAKS OFF, SEEING) Oh my God!\nPERI: What is it? Arnie?!?\nMCALLISTER: By your feet. Behind that transmitter column. Don’t look.\nPERI: Why? — (SHE LOOKS) Oh!\nMCALLISTER: Is he dead?\nPERI: I don’t know, I’m not a nurse!\nMCALLISTER: Well, kick him.\nPERI: Yeah, I know enough to know that’s not how you do it. (BEAT) There’s no blood, but... yeah, I’m pretty sure.\nMCALLISTER: Poor guy. Whoever he was.\nPERI: (READING BADGE) ‘Andrew Jameson. Communications officer.’\nMCALLISTER: You alright?\nPERI: I guess. I don’t know if I’ve seen a dead body before.\nMCALLISTER: Me neither. It’s OK.\nPERI: No, it’s not. What if.. what one of us killed him? Arnie?\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 27\nDESTINY: (SHOVING DOCTOR) Get in there, Question Marks.\nDOCTOR: Captain, there’s no need to push.\nDESTINY: Officer Stone, any news?\nSTONE: As it happens — I’ve found the viewport control.\nDESTINY: Viewport? What viewport?\nDOCTOR: That viewport. Up there.\nDESTINY: Is that... lava?\nDOCTOR: Red-hot magma. Around a ship with no shields. No wonder it’s warm in here.\nDESTINY: You were right, Question Marks.\nDOCTOR: It’s no comfort.\nMCALLISTER: (SMALL LOUDSPEAKER) Cadet McAllister to control room. Come in, please.\nDESTINY: Where’s that coming from-?\nSTONE: Comms array.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 28\nMCALLISTER: (D) Repeat, McAllister to [Control Room] —\nDESTINY: Captain Gray, receiving. Did you get a signal out, Cadet?\nMCALLISTER: (D) Not yet, there’s just static.\nDOCTOR: No surprise there, with a sea of magma above us.\nMCALLISTER: (D) There’s something else. A body. Someone named Jameson. He’s dead.\nDESTINY: Murdered?\nMCALLISTER: (D) Can’t tell.\nDOCTOR: I don’t like the way you’re looking at me, Captain.\nDESTINY: Guilty conscience? Did he catch you at the shield generator, Question Marks? Give you that bruise?\nDOCTOR: So — what? I dragged his body all way to the communications room, then locked myself behind a bulkhead?\nSTONE: Or maybe the rest of us locked you behind the bulkhead because you killed this ‘Jameson’?\nDESTINY: Wait here, Stone. Keep an eye on him. (EXITING) I’m going to check on this body.\nDOCTOR: What was that-?\nSTONE: The Captain just locked us in here.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: No, not that —\nDOCTOR: That. (LOOKING AROUND) It’s coming from over... here.\nSTONE: A puddle. Must be a leaky pipe somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Don’t touch it! That’s not water, it’s plastic. Molten plastic!\nSTONE: From where?\nDOCTOR: Look up, Mr Stone.\nSTONE: The viewport! It’s melting...!\nDOCTOR: The shields are down. The magma’s getting in!\nSTONE: It’s cracking!\nDOCTOR: Close the hatch, man. Hurry!\nSTONE: It’s stuck! It won’t move!\nDOCTOR: And we're locked in. (INTO COMMS) Cadet McAllister. Arnie. Tell the Captain —\nSTONE: Look out above you!\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR: Well, so much for the comms.\nSTONE: What do we do now-?\nDOCTOR: Improvise! (RUSHING TO ONE SIDE) Help me free this coolant duct.\nSTONE: What are going to do? Freeze lava with coolant?\nDOCTOR: We can clear a path around us, at least!\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 31\nPERI: (RUNNING UP) You locked them in there? Destiny?\nDESTINY: (STOPPING, TURNING WHEEL) Leave this to me, girl.\nDESTINY: (FX: WHEEL TURNED, DOOR SWUNG OPEN. SOUNDS OF LAVA, SPRAYING FROM INSIDE)\nDESTINY: Oh my goodness —\nPERI: That’s what the alarm was for!\nSTONE: (RUNNING TO DOOR) Captain! The viewport’s cracked! The magma’s\nDESTINY: Just get through here, Mr Stone!\nPERI: (CALLING) Question Marks! Hurry!\nDOCTOR: (OFF) I am hurrying-\nPERI: What are you doing? You can’t shut him in there!\nSTONE: That’s liquid lava! Captain!\nDESTINY: I told you he doesn’t belong here.\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND DOOR) Please, Destiny! This isn’t fair!\nDESTINY: No, Question Marks. You sabotaged the shield generator.\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND DOOR) If I did.. I’m sure I had a reason.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 32\nDESTINY: And Jameson? Did you have a good reason for shooting him?\nPERI: Please, Captain. We may not remember exactly who we are, but I won’t believe that we’re inhuman-!\nDESTINY: I’ve worked it out. Question Marks was found by Jameson, so he shot him. We locked him up, and took the gun. This gun.\nDOCTOR: What, the one you’ve been carrying? Well, there’s no way anyone was shot with that!\nDESTINY: (BEHIND DOOR) You don’t know that.\nDOCTOR: I do. Because it isn’t a gun.\nDESTINY: (BEHIND DOOR) What?\nDOCTOR: It’s just a tool. A laser pointer. I realised some time ago — you’re not soldiers, you’re scientists. This is a research ship.\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND DOOR) I daresay you were studying this magma, which right now I’m studying a little too closely for comfort, so if you wouldn’t mind —\nPERI: Open the door, Captain! Now!!!\nPERI: (FX: WHEEL TURNS. DOOR OPENS. BUBBLING LAVA AND SMOKE. EXPLOSIONS. SPARKS. )\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Thank you.\nPERI: Any time.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL)\nSTONE: We’ve lost the control room. What now?\nDOCTOR: The bulkhead should give us a few minutes.\nPERI: And then-?\nDESTINY: Back to the comms room. Hurry!\nDESTINY: Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 34\nMCALLISTER: Mayday, mayday. Can anyone hear me? Mayday, mayday. — Oh, what’s the point?\nDESTINY: (ENTERING) Girl, Question Marks, Stone, inside.\nPERI: (ENTERING) Arnie!\nMCALLISTER: Thank goodness you’re alright —\nSTONE: The alarm’s cut out.\nDESTINY: Yes, and the lights are fading.\nDOCTOR: Which means, the magma’s reached the power cables.\nDOCTOR: We don’t have much time. Destiny, do you still have that component from the shields?\nDESTINY: Here.\nDOCTOR: You got me thinking, Captain. What possible reason could I have for removing it?\nPERI: Well?\nDOCTOR: I think it could be used to create a matter field. A shield around us.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 35\nPERI: To protect us from the lava?\nDOCTOR: More than that. Coupled with the communications booster here might be possible to transmit everything in that field up to the surface.\nDESTINY: Rig up a transmat you mean?\nMCALLISTER: That’s crazy!\nPERI: Yes, but could it work?\nDESTINY: This circuit’s heavily charred.\nDOCTOR: I might be able to bypass the damaged areas.\nDESTINY: How?\nDOCTOR: In case you hadn’t noticed, I appear to be possessed of a\nDOCTOR: at\nDOCTOR: Superior intellect. Stone, help me open that hatch down to the\nDOCTOR: transmitter. — (BEAT) Stone? Where’s he gone?\nDESTINY: He’s over.. oh.\nMCALLISTER: He was here a second ago.\nPERI: He can’t have left this room!\nDOCTOR: Worry about him later.\nDOCTOR: Destiny, with me. I might need your tool.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR'S STEPS GOING DOWN A LADDER. DESTINY FOLLOWS. SPARKS. CRUNCHING METAL. )\nPERI: Arnie, we haven’t got much longer. I was wondering: would it be\nPERI: alright to.. hold me?\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR: (BOUNDING UP) Captain, pull those cables. I’1l have to insert this component between the transmitter and the emergency power cells.\nDESTINY: Someone’s beaten us to it. Look at this lot.\nDOCTOR: Those are the other shield generator components.\nDESTINY: All charred. They’re in a worse state than your one.\nDOCTOR: They’ve blown. Must have been a power surge in the transmitter coil.\nDESTINY: That’s where Jameson was found. Did it electrocute him, I wondeYr...?\nDOCTOR: And wipe our memories in the process? It makes [no sense. ]\nDOCTOR: The girl?\nDESTINY: (CALLS) What is it? What’s going on up there?\nPERI: (CLIMBING DOWN LADDER) It’s Arnie.\nDESTINY: What?\nPERI: McAllister. He, he’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Gone? Gone where?\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 38\nPERI: He just, just —\nDOCTOR: He left the room?\nPERI: He disappeared. Vanished!\nDESTINY: People don’t just vanish.\nPERI: I tell you, he did! He just turned into air. He was in my arms, I felt him — go...\nDOCTOR: First Stone, now McAllister?\nDESTINY: The lights!\nDOCTOR: That’s it. Main power’s gone.\nPERI: I can see something glowing. Along that conduit, there!\nDOCTOR: Lava. It’s seeping along the vents.\nDESTINY: (GASPING) It’s getting harder to breathe.\nPERI: (GASPING) Good news, at last. Guess I’d rather suffocate than be boiled to de-[ath. ]\nPERI: (FX. BACKWARDS POP AS PERI DISAPPEARS BEFORE THE DOCTOR AND DESTINY’S EYES. )\nDESTINY: What? Where did she go?\nDOCTOR: She just... went.\nDESTINY: One second she was there, the next...\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR: Destiny. The lava’s rising. We have to get out of here.\nDESTINY: But...\nDOCTOR: Up that ladder, now!\nDOCTOR: (FX: PANICKED STEPS UP THE LADDER. LAVA SPURTS IN. MELTING\nMETAL. SPARKS. CONTINUES INTO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 40\nDESTINY: (COUGH, ENTERING) Now what?\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) That was our only chance.\nDESTINY: Question Marks, look at the screen. There’s a signal!\nREAL PERT: (ON COMMUNICATOR) Hello? Is anyone there?\nDESTINY: It’s the girl. She must have beamed out.\nDESTINY: Girl, help us.\nREAL PERI: (D) Destiny? Is that you?\nDOCTOR: That’s not possible.\nREAL PERI: (D) Doctor, you did it! It’s coming through!\nDESTINY: Question Marks... look!\nDOCTOR: Yes. That’s me.\nDESTINY: How can you be both there, and here?\nDOCTOR: Of course. The evidence was staring us in the face.\nDESTINY: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: The failing ship, the butchered shield generator, the blown transmitter coil.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 41\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) I’m so sorry, Doctor, Destiny. As you can see, we already beamed out.\nDESTINY: But this is madness! We’re still here.\nDOCTOR: No. We’re copies. Aren’t we, Doctor?\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) I’m afraid so. Mayfly copies created by an unstable transmat device.\nDESTINY: But I’m real. I’m here. I can think. I can feel.\nDOCTOR: No. We’re just partial traces. Echoes. —\nDESTINY: Question Marks? Not you, as well!\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) I’m sorry, Destiny. I didn’t believe any of you would last more than a few moments. But then we caught a trace of your Signal, which I was able to patch through my TARDIS.\nDESTINY: Your what-? Please, you have to get me out of here!\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) You’re already out of there, Destiny. You, Mr Stone, Cadet McAllister. All safe and sound.\nDESTINY: What about Jameson? Is Jameson there too?\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) Don’t worry. His sacrifice was not in vain.\nDESTINY: Sacrifice?\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) We knew that someone had to stay behind, to hit the switch and activate the process. Jameson took it upon himself. He whacked you over the head with a sonic wrench and shut me\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: behind a sealed bulkhead. We transmatted out of those exact positions, which is why our copies... well.\nDESTINY: And the girl?\nDOCTOR: Peri, you mean? She’s with me. We’re travellers. My ship materialised aboard your vessel. She was engulfed by lava when your shields failed, causing her displacement system to send her to the surface, leaving the pair of us behind. Not that any of that matters now.\nDESTINY: Who are you, Question Marks?\nREAL DOCTOR: (D) Your friend.\nDOCTOR WHO: QUESTION MARKS by Philip Lawrence (FINAL) Page 43\nDESTINY: (D) I’m scared, Question Marks.\nREAL DOCTOR: I know.\nDESTINY: (D) Talk to me. Please. I don’t want to die, not on my own.\nREAL DOCTOR: I’m not going anywhere, Destiny.\nDESTINY: (D) You’re travellers, right? You and Peri. Tell me about that. Where did you come from? Where are you going?\nREAL DOCTOR: Well — not so very long ago, Peri and I were at the 2351 Galaxy Fair. (FX: IN B/G, DESTINY POPS OUT OF EXISTENCE) Before that,\nREAL DOCTOR: on the lost planet Sendosa. And before that, at the court of King Henry the Eighth, would you believe...?\nREAL DOCTOR: Destiny? Are you there? Are you receiving me? Destiny?\nREAL DOCTOR: THE END"
