They came from out there... We shouldn’t have... shouldn’t have—\nHEDGERTON: LEE ENFIELD RIFLES ARE COCKED NEARBY. GENTLE FOOTSTEPS OF WINGFORD ACROSS SAND.\nWINGFORD: (APPROACHING. CALMLY) It’s all right, Hedgerton. My men aren’t going to open fire. Not unless I tell them to. We’re just here to take you back. You want to come back, don’t you?\nHEDGERTON: I... I don’t know. I’m... I’m...\nWINGFORD: Confused?\nHEDGERTON: Yes... That’s it. Confused.\nWINGFORD: Of course you are, old chap. These are difficult times. No need to worry, though. We’ll get you sorted.

Remember, it’s all in the interests of National Security.\nHEDGERTON: All... in the... interests of... of... of...\nWINGFORD: (PROMPTING GENTLY) National Security. Remember?\nHEDGERTON: National Security. Yes. I remember.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 7\nWINGFORD: Good. Good, there’s a good chap. Now come on, take my hand. That’s it.\nWINGFORD: FOOTSTEPS ON SAND AS THEY LEAVE.\nHEDGERTON: (LIKE A MANTRA) All in the interests of National Security. All in the interests of National Security. All in the interests of National Security.\nHEDGERTON: THROUGH THIS, THEIR FOOTSTEPS ON SAND AS THEY WALK AWAY.\nWINGFORD: (CALMLY, OVER THIS) There, there. That’s it. Well done. Everything’s going to be all right.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 8\nJO: But you’re not... I mean. What do you mean, ‘not quite the Doctor I was expecting’?\nDOCTOR: I mean... Actually, I’m not sure what I mean. I don’t even know what’s happened.\nJO: Oh, I get it.\nDOCTOR: Get what?\nJO: It’s what happened before, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: What happened before?\nJO: When there were two of you in the TARDIS and another one on the scanner. You know, the old one with the long white hair and the one with a sort of Beatles haircu—\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes, I remember that.\nJO: I thought there were only three of you. You mean there are actually four of you?\nDOCTOR: Well... seven, at least.\nJO: Seven?\nDOCTOR: So far. I’m number seven.\nJO: So where are the others?\nDOCTOR: Just me. No sign of the others.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 9\nJO: Is this the Time Lords again? Is there some sort of crisis in space or something?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nJO: You don’t know? How do I know you’re telling the truth?\nDOCTOR: Ah, but that’s just it. You don’t.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH AS CORNELIUS ENTERS.\nCORNELIUS: Ah, Doctor, there you are.\nDOCTOR: You recognise me?\nCORNELIUS: Of course.\nJO: (MUTTERS) You’re one up on me, then.\nCORNELIUS: I beg your pardon?\nJO: Nothing.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor. My name is Captain Cornelius. His Brittanic Majesty’s Security Services require your presence.\nDOCTOR: Do they indeed.\nCORNELIUS: While you’re here, you’re under British jurisdiction.\nDOCTOR: ‘While I’m here’?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 10\nCORNELIUS: (IGNORING HIM) You have no choice. I have orders to take you and Miss Grant to a secure location. I expect Miss Grant has explained.\nDOCTOR: Er no... we’ve had other pressing matters to—\nJO: There’s nothing much to explain. (POINTEDLY) It’s alla bit ‘hush, hush’ apparently.\nDOCTOR: Jo, what’s going on?\nJO: I’ve no idea. The Brigadier’s in Geneva. Mike Yates was in command, but apparently he, Sergeant Benton and everyone else have been shipped out and replaced by— SOLDIERS IN FULL KIT COME JOGGING IN.\nJO: . this lot!\nCORNELIUS: All right, carry on, Sergeant Wilkins. Escort these two to the helicopter.\nDOCTOR: And what if we don’t want to be escorted to your helicopter?\nDOCTOR: RIFLES ARE COCKED.\nJO: You’re not serious!\nCORNELIUS: Deadly, Miss Grant. It’s a matter of Natio—\nJO: National Security. So you said.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 11\nDOCTOR: I think he means it, Jo. We’d better do as he says.\nDOCTOR: THEY ARE BUSTLED OUT OF THE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 12\nDOCTOR: THE HELICOPTER ENGINE IS STILL RUNNING, ROTAR BLADES WHOOSHING.

Interesting.\nJO: Really? I’m more interested in whether or not you’re who you say you are.\nDOCTOR: And I’m also interested in why you didn’t voice your suspicions about me to Captain Cornelius.\nJO: Because... well, I suppose I trust him even less than I trust you.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take that as a compliment, Jo.\nJO: (NOT HAPPY) Hmmn...\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 13\nJO: HELICOPTER SOUND OUTSIDE. COMMS BLEEP.\nCORNELIUS: Yes, we’ve refuelled and they’re boarding the helicopter.\nCORNELIUS: STRANGE, DISTORTED NOISE FROM HIS ‘WALKIE-TALKIE’.\nCORNELIUS: (AS IF REPLYING) Yes, I’m going to scan it now.\nCORNELIUS: THE SOUND OF HIM TAKING A SMALL DEVICE FROM HIS POCKET. A FEW HI-TECH-SOUNDING CONTROLS ARE PRESSED. THE WARBLE OF\nCORNELIUS: A SHORT SCANNING SOUND. A FEW BLEEPS OF CONFIRMATION.\nCORNELIUS: It’s confirmed. We’ve found it. It’s the TARDIS all right.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 14\nCORNELIUS: LATER IN FLIGHT.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS (OF CORNELIUS) CLAMBER IN. DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

Don’t you mean, ‘Hey, Doctor’?\nJO: Huh. Look down there. Look.\nDOCTOR: Now I wonder what that’s for...\nJO: Captain?\nCORNELIUS: Yes, Miss Grant?\nJO: There’s a lorry arriving at UNIT HQ down there. What’s it for?\nCORNELIUS: I think it’s time we... er, restricted your view. Put the hoods on them.\nDOCTOR: What? Aargh—\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 15\nCORNELIUS: Sorry about this, but I’m afraid it’s necessary. We can’t allow you to see where you’re going.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED THROUGH HOOD) How thoughtful of you. We wouldn’t want to become a risk to National Security, would we?\nCORNELIUS: Quite. Now sit back and enjoy the ride. It’s going to take a while.\nJO: (MUFFLED THROUGH HOOD) A while? What if we get\nJO: claustrophobic?\nCORNELIUS: (WRY CHUCKLE) Just remember, it’s for King and country!\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) King... ?

Er, no, it’s all right, Commander, I ex...\nWINGFORD: Oh, now I did, didn’t I? You were asleep.\nHEDGERTON: Well...\nWINGFORD: Sorry about that, old chap. I just wanted to pop by and check up on you. See if you were all right. You’re important to us, you know. To the vital work we’re doing here on Delphin.\nHEDGERTON: (VAGUE) Vital work? Oh, yes, yes, of course.\nWINGFORD: You’re our engineer. You’re pivotal to the plan. And don’t worry, your work will soon be over.\nHEDGERTON: Will it?\nWINGFORD: Oh yes. Absolutely. Just one last push. Now, what you need is a nice visit to Level Zero-One.\nHEDGERTON: (SOME DAWNING DREAD) Level Zero-One?\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 17\nWINGFORD: (ENCOURAGING) Yes. It’1ll do you the world of good. Just what you need.\nHEDGERTON: Just... what I... I need?\nWINGFORD: Yes. You have your little rest, then I’1l send a couple of my chaps to come and get you, all right?\nHEDGERTON: Rest... Yes.. yes, of course. Level Zero-One.\nWINGFORD: Get some rest.

THEIR CONVERSATION IS CONFIDENTIAL IN TONE. HEADS TOGETHER.\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) Jo? Jo...\nJO: (WAKING UP) Um? Sorry, I fell asleep. Did they drug us or something?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. It’s just the dark and the droning of the rotar-blades.. sends you to sleep.\nJO: So you’ve been awake?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nJO: How long have we been travelling?\nDOCTOR: Just about three and a half hours.\nJO: How do you know that?\nDOCTOR: I have an infallible sense of time, Jo. And I also know we’re about to land.\nJO: How come?\nDOCTOR: The Westland Whirlwind helicopter has a maximum reach of just over 300 miles. Its top speed is 86 miles per hour, and we’ve certainly been travelling at top speed. So if we've been flying for about three and a half hours, we’ll have to land soon... Or crash into the sea.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 19\nJO: The sea? How do you— ?\nDOCTOR: I can smell it.\nCORNELIUS: (APPROACHING) All right, you two, you can stop gossiping now. We’re about to land.\nJO: You were right, D— Er, you were right.\nDOCTOR: You nearly called me Doctor.\nJO: Only nearly.. whoever you are. You still haven’t explained yourself—\nDOCTOR: Only because I don’t have an explanation, Jo.\nDOCTOR: CROSS-FADE TO EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE. WAVES CRASHING ON ROCKS.

Where are we?\nJO: PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: Top secret?\nCORNELIUS: Correct, Doctor.\nJO: You were right about the sea... er, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was, wasn’t I? You know, Captain Cornelius, I get the distinct feeling we’re on an island.\nCORNELIUS: Do you now, sir?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere in British Territorial Waters... maybe in the North Sea?\nCORNELIUS: (WITH A SMILE) I couldn’t possibly comment, sir.\nDOCTOR: Hmmm. No, I’m sure you couldn’t possibly.\nJO: So, where to now? Are you just going to let us freeze to death on a cliff-top?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 21\nCORNELIUS: Time’s getting on. We’ve got some accommodation for you down in the village.\nDOCTOR: Village? What village?\nCORNELIUS: You'll see. It’s not far off. This way, there’s a track\nCORNELIUS: down here.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 22\nCORNELIUS: SOLDIERS, CORNELIUS, DOCTOR AND JO WALKING ALONG A TRACK. SHELTERED, NO WIND NOW. SEAGULLS IN BACKGROUND.\nJO: (CONFIDENTIALLY) I think you’re right about this being an island. I can’t see any coastline in the distance.\nDOCTOR: (CONFIDENTIALLY) No, neither can I. Just the sea. Mind you, it is starting to get dark now.\nCORNELIUS: Here we are, Doctor! Up ahead!\nDOCTOR: Ah yes. Very picturesque.\nJO: Where are you taking us?\nCORNELIUS: Down the hill, straight along the quayside. The local pub.\nJO: You flew us all this way just to buy us a drink?\nCORNELIUS: (AMUSED) Huh, in a way, Miss Grant. Yes.\nDOCTOR: Quite a fleet of small boats moored in the harbour, Captain. Must be a thriving fishing industry here.\nCORNELIUS: Er... perhaps.\nJO: Perhaps? What sort of answer is that? Are you obsessed with secrecy when it comes to any information? What if we want to buy you a drink in the pub? Will that be too ‘hush-hush’ for you to tell us what you want?\nCORNELIUS: Just along here, Miss Grant.\nCORNELIUS: A FEW MORE FOOTSTEPS, THEN THEY COME A HALT.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 23\nDOCTOR: (READING) ‘The Delphin Arms’. (BEAT) Looks very warm and inviting. Lovely glow from the fire inside.\nCORNELIUS: Yes. Commander Wingford was keen for you to get a taste of the local hospitality before you join us in the base tomorrow.\nJO: There’s a base here, then, is there?\nCORNELIUS: Of course, Miss Grant. Yes.\nJO: What sort of base— ? Oh, don’t tell me, a top secret one.\nCORNELIUS: Naturally.\nJO: And we're staying the night in this pub?\nCORNELIUS: Yes.\nDOCTOR: (INTRIGUED) Captain, if our presence was so urgently required... Why are you wasting our time with ‘local hospitality’?\nDOCTOR: AWKWARD PAUSE.\nJO: Captain?\nCORNELIUS: Commander Wingford’s orders, Miss. Simple as that. In you\nCORNELIUS: go. HE OPENS THE PUB DOOR.\nCORNELIUS: SOME GENTLE HUBBUB WAFTS FROM INSIDE. (WILDTRACK)\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 24\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Captain. You won’t be joining us for a drink?\nCORNELIUS: No, Doctor. But my men and I shan’t be far away.\nJO: That sounds a bit like a threat.\nCORNELIUS: (SMILES) Does it? Enjoy yourselves.\nDOCTOR: Thank you...\nTHEY GO IN AND DOOR CLOSES: CUT TO...\nTHEY GO IN AND DOOR CLOSES: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 25\nJEREMIAH: (CALLING FROM THE BAR) Come in, don’t be shy now!\nDOCTOR: (TO JEREMIAH) Oh, thank you!\nJO: (SOTTO) This is just... a bit weird. Bringing us all this way.. to stay in a pub.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) And I’11 tell you something else that’s a bit ‘weird’.\nJO: (SOTTO) What?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I think our Captain Cornelius was wearing make-\nDOCTOR: up.\nJO: (SOTTO) Make-up?\nJEREMIAH: Come on, now!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) When I spoke to him at the door, with the light from the pub shining on him.. There was a line where his skin colour changed, just below his collar.\nJO: (SOTTO) Um... I’m not sure what that proves...\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Me neither.\nJEREMIAH: (CALLING FROM BAR) Come on. No meandering. Come over and\nJEREMIAH: have a pint of our finest.

We’re the landlord and landlady of the Delphin Arms.\nDOCTOR: (DEADPAN) And there we were, wondering why you were standing behind the bar.\nDOCTOR: AWKWARD PAUSE.\nJEREMIAH: (SUDDENLY LAUGHS) Ah, very good. Very funny. And you two are... ?\nJO: Didn’t the commander tell you?\nCLAIRE: No. Just said two very important [sic] VIPs from the mainland would be staying.\nJO: ‘Mainland’, you were right. This is an island.\nJEREMIAH: That’s right. Delphin Island.\nDOCTOR: (DEADPAN) Oh, they named it after your pub.\nCLAIRE: No.. It’s the other way round, dear.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes... of course.\nJO: (SOTTO) Doctor, what are you—?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 27\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Just a little irony test, Jo. And you just called me ‘Doctor’.\nJO: Wha— ? Oh, well, I didn’t mean to.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 28\nJO: SOME HUBBUB FROM THE PUB CAN BE HEARD, MUFFLED IN THE BACKGROUND.\nJO: COMMS BLEEP.\nCORNELIUS: (RESPONDING) Cornelius. Go ahead.\nWINGFORD: (DISTORT) Are they happy?\nCORNELIUS: Relatively. The Doctor seems... suspicious.\nWINGFORD: (DISTORT) They should be happier after some social interaction, a hearty meal and a good night’s sleep.\nCORNELIUS: Any news from London?\nWINGFORD: (DISTORT) All security protocols are still active. There shouldn’t be any trouble before we’re ready. Keep an eye on the pub, Cornelius.\nWINGFORD: Will do. Out.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 29\nWINGFORD: PULLING TWO PINTS.\nJEREMIAH: Now then, here’s a pint of best for you both.\nJEREMIAH: FULL GLASSES PLONKED ON BAR DURING THE FOLLOWING.\nCLAIRE: Drink up now.

Rotten and sour. Don’t drink any\nDOCTOR: more, but keep smiling.\nJO: (SOTTO, TO THE DOCTOR) Let’s hope the food’s better.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, TO JO) Hmm, let’s hope so.

A LIGHT WIND BLOWS, RIGGING RATTLES. SOME GENTLE SEAWASH.\nCUT TO: JO’S FOOTSTEPS ON CREAKY FLOORBOARDS.\nCUT TO: SHE STOPS. WE HEAR A RUSTLE OF HER TAKING SOMETHING OUT OF HER POCKET. SOMETHING PLASTIC AND METAL (HER SECRET TRANSCEIVER - ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH). A BUTTON CLICKS.\nCUT TO: STATIC BURST.\nJO: (SOTTO) Emergency transmission. Setting coded scrambler.\nJO: A CLICK AND A STRANGE, DISTORTED SQUAWKING NOISE.\nJO: This is Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader. Are you receiving me, over?\nJO: STATIC FOR A FEW SECONDS. (TO HERSELF, IMPATIENT) Oh, come on, Mike. Come on.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 37\nJO: THE DISTINCTIVE DEEP THROB OF AIR CONDITIONING. DOOR KNOCKS.\nWINGFORD: Come.\nWINGFORD: DOOR OPENS. FOOTSTEPS IN, STAND TO ATTENTION.\nCORNELIUS: Sir!\nWINGFORD: Ah, Cornelius. Everything all right at the pub?\nCORNELIUS: They went to bed a couple of hours ago. Not a peep out of them since.\nWINGFORD: I’m afraid you’re wrong about that, Captain. Seems the girl had a concealed transceiver on her. She’s attempted to use it once to contact Yates.\nCORNELIUS: Did she make contact?\nWINGFORD: No. But she will. The officers at the holding location in London will have told him. We can’t prevent that. And it won't be long before she tries again. Yates will probably be waiting for her call.\nWINGFORD: A STRANGE BLEEPING SIGNAL.\nCORNELIUS: That’1l be it.\nCORNELIUS: A SWITCH FLICKS.\nCORNELIUS: WE HEAR THE FOLLOWING ON SPEAKER.\nJO: (DISTORT) This is Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader. Are\nJO: you receiving me, over?\nJO: STATIC BURST.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 38\nYATES: (DISTORT) Greyhound Leader receiving. Coded scrambler engaged. Go ahead, Jo. Where are you?\nJO: (DISTORT) We’re on Delphin Island, apparently.\nMIKE: (DISTORT) Apparently? You and the Doctor?\nMIKE: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 39\nJO: (HESITATES) Er.. well...\nYATES: (DISTORT) Jo? Jo, what’s the matter? Are you all right?\nJO: So far. Listen, Mike—\nYATES: (DISTORT) What do you mean, so far? Jo? Where is this Delphin Island anyway? I’ve never heard of it.\nJO: Neither had I. Mike, where are you? What’s going on?\nYATES: (DISTORT) London. Secure premises. There’s some kind of security flap on.\nJO: Yes, that’s what Cornelius told us.\nYATES: (DISTORT) Cornelius? Who’s he?\nJO: The regular army officer who had us brought here. So you’ve no idea what all this is about?\nYATES: (DISTORT) None at all. To be honest, it’s been really getting on my nerves. I’ve spent the last few hours here trying to get answers. But all I get in return is blank faces and lectures on National Security. I can’t even get in touch with the Brigadier. (BEAT) Look, Jo, how did you get to this island?\nYATES: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 40\nYATES: THE DISTINCTIVE DEEP THROB OF AIR CONDITIONING.\nJO: (DISTORT) Well, there was a helicopter.\nWINGFORD: I think that’s enough.\nJO: (DISTORT) And... er, well the... the Doctor... (SHE THINKS BETTER OF GOING INTO THE WHOLE ‘DOCTOR ISN’T THE DOCTOR’ BUSINESS HERE) Er, he said we'd travelled about three hours.\nCORNELIUS: Jam it?\nWINGFORD: Yes.\nCORNELIUS: (OBEYING) Sir.\nYATES: (DISTORT) So you were travelling for three hours and—\nYATES: CLICK OF SWITCH.\nJO: (DISTORT) Mike? Mike, can you hear me? Mike, come in. Come— (CUT OFF)\nJO: CLICK OF SWITCH. SPEAKER OFF.\nWINGFORD: You should have searched her, Cornelius.\nCORNELIUS: [*m sorry, sir. 1 didn*t think=\nWINGFORD: It doesn’t matter now. They’ll feel reassured enough after the hospitality of the pub and a good night’s sleep, I’m sure of it. They’1ll soon acclimatise. And besides, there’s no immediate rush. We can’t proceed until the arrival of the vital component.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 41\nCORNELIUS: Understood, sir.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 42\nJO: Mike... Can you hear me?\nJO: STATIC BURST. Mike? DOOR OPENS.\nJO: DOCTOR'S FOOTSTEPS ENTER LIGHTLY.\nDOCTOR: They’re jamming his transmission.\nJO: Who is?\nDOCTOR: Whoever was listening in.\nJO: And were you? Listening in, I mean?\nDOCTOR: You were speaking quite loudly. So was Mike Yates.\nJO: (SUDDENLY WORRIED) Oh... Do you think the landlord and landlady heard us?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nJO: You don’t know much, do you?\nDOCTOR: Don’t I?\nJO: And the Doctor would know.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 43\nDOCTOR: Would he? Yes, I suppose he might have thought he knew. He was such a resolute sort of fellow, wasn’t he?\nJO: So, you admit you’re not him.\nDOCTOR: Of course I’m not him. But I am the Doctor. A different version. A future version.\nJO: (SCEPTICAL) You said.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I did.\nJO: The seventh.\nDOCTOR: I don’t blame you for not believing me, Jo. Especially Since I don’t really have any answers. And you’re used to your Doctor having all the answers. I was a very confident chap back in... these days.\nJO: (LEADING UP TO TESTING HIM) I mentioned that I’ve seen two other versions of the Doctor, earlier.\nDOCTOR: You did. What of it?\nJO: Well, if you really are the Doctor... a future, seventh version... you’d know why those Doctors were togeth—\nDOCTOR: To defeat Omega. This is going to be a test, is it? Ask me anything you like.\nJO: (EMBOLDENED) Okay then, what was the name of the planet where we had to pretend I was a princess so that— ?\nDOCTOR: Peladon— is this going to take all night? Because we’ve got work to do, young lady.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 44\nJO: What sort of work?\nDOCTOR: Do you accept that I’m the Doctor now?\nJO: (RELUCTANT) Maybe.\nDOCTOR: Then ‘maybe’ will have to do. (HUSHED) Come on.\nDOCTOR: HE OPENS THE DOOR.\nJO: (HUSHED) Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) To take a look at the boats in the harbour—\nJO: The boats?\nDOCTOR: — there was something about them that worried me, but I want to— [make certain]\nJO: (HUSHED) Never mind the boats, I’m more worried about that awful beer and the terrible food.\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) Good point, we’ll investigate those on the way. Follow me.\nDOCTOR: START TO FADE OUT.\nJO: And then there’s the fact that you thought Captain\nJO: Cornelius was wearing make-up.\nDOCTOR: Ssssh.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 45\nDOCTOR: SAUCEPANS CLATTER NOISILY TO THE FLOOR.\nJO: Sssssh! Can’t we turn the light on?\nJO: FLICKING OF SWITCH.\nDOCTOR: It’s not working. You take a look around here. I’11 nip down to the cellar.\nDOCTOR: DOOR CLOSES AND HE SCUTTLES OFF.\nJO: (HUSHED) But Doctor—!\nDOCTOR: (HEADING OFF - FROM BEHIND DOOR. TEASING) Thank you for calling me Doctor again.\nDOCTOR: HE’S GONE.\nJO: (TO HERSELF) Oh, what if I did? (SIGHS) I know he’s had\nJO: different faces... so I suppose— Oh, I don’t know. Anyway...\nJO: WE HEAR HER OPEN A CUPBOARD AND RUMMAGE FOR QUITE A FEW SECONDS. CANS HANDLED.\nJO: Aha. Just as I thought. Canned food. Potatoes, carrots... bully beef.\nJO: DOOR OPENS. (GASPS, STARTLED) Will you stop doing that?\nDOCTOR: I said bully beef, didn’t I?\nJO: What did you find in the cellar?\nDOCTOR: Rotting barrels. That beer’s been off for years.\nJO: Years. Seriously?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 46\nDOCTOR: Seriously. Lucky we only had a sip. I think it might’ve proved fatal otherwise.\nJO: Really? Beer? Fatal?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. Come on, let’s take a look in the harbour.\nJO: What is it about those boats you’re so— ?\nDOCTOR: Ssh. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 47\nDOCTOR: LAPPING OF SEA. COLD BREEZE. RATTLE OF RIGGING. PUB DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR AND JO ARE VERY HUSHED.\nJO: Careful... there’s a soldier on guard over there.\nDOCTOR: He’s not looking our way. We can make it to the jetty.\nDOCTOR: Come on, follow me. Quickly.\nDOCTOR: THEY SCAMPER AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT THEIR FOOTSTEPS ARE STILL NOISY IN THE NIGHT AIR.\nDOCTOR: BOTH SLIGHTLY OUT OF BREATH, THEY TAKE COVER. WATER LAPPING IS CLOSER NOW.\nJO: He must’ve heard us. What’s the matter with him?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Jo. He’s just staring into nothing.\nJO: It’s still too dark to see your precious boats.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. but it’s late.. or early. The sun will be coming up\nDOCTOR: soon.\nJO: So... what? We just wai-— ? Wait a minute. Look.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nJO: Down there. Something in the water, look.\nDOCTOR: Wh— ? Oh no. Come on! There’s a slipway, follow me.\nDOCTOR: THEY SCRAMBLE DOWN TO THE STONE SLIPWAY.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 48\nDOCTOR: WE HEAR CLOSER LAPPING OF THE WATER. SOMETHING TO SUGGEST THERE ARE BODIES IN THE WATER, IF THAT’S POSSIBLE.\nJO: (SHOCKED) It’s a body.\nDOCTOR: More than one, Jo. Look.\nJO: But. Oh my G— That’s Claire.\nDOCTOR: And Jeremiah... And everyone else who was in the pub last night.\nJO: But they’re not moving... Just floating there. All of them... dead.\nJO: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 49 PART TWO.\nJO: (SHOCKED) It’s a body.\nDOCTOR: More than one, Jo. Look.\nJO: But. Oh my G— That’s Claire.\nDOCTOR: And Jeremiah... And everyone else who was in the pub last night.\nJO: But they’re not moving.. Just floating there. All of then... dead.\nJO: DOCTOR DASHES FORWARD.\nDOCTOR: Quickly, help me with them. (EFFORT AS HE STARTS TO DRAG A BODY UP THE SLIPWAY )\nDOCTOR: BODY IS DRAGGED UP THE SLIPWAY.\nJO: (EFFORT AS SHE JOINS IN) He’s freezing cold.\nJO: BODY DRAGGING HALTS. RUSTLE AS DOCTOR CHECKS PULSE.\nDOCTOR: No pulse. He’s dead.\nJO: You expected him to be alive? He’s blue.\nDOCTOR: Yes... very blue. Too blue.\nJO: ‘Too’— ?\nJO: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.\nJO: (HUSHED) It’s that soldier. He’s heard us.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 50\nJO: GUN COCKED SOME WAY OFF.\nSOLDIER: (OFF) You two. Don’t move.\nJO: You've got to help us. Some of them may still be alive.\nSOLDIER: (OFF) Stay where you are or I’11 shoot.\nDOCTOR: You don’t seem surprised to see these bodies. Did you\nDOCTOR: know they were here? LANDROVER APPROACHING IN DISTANCE.\nJO: (SOTTO) More company. (ALOUD) Please, won’t you help us?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Seems a bit blank, doesn’t he?\nJO: Yes. Callous, even.\nJO: LANDROVER PULLS UP. DOOR OPENS.\nJO: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.\nCORNELIUS: (APPROACHING) It’s all right, Jenkins, I’1l handle Doctor, Miss Grant, what are you doing out of bed?\nCORNELIUS: often go wandering around during the small hours?\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t aware we were under house arrest.\nCORNELIUS: You’re not.\nJO: Did you know about these poor people?\nCORNELIUS: (ODDLY DISCONNECTED FOR A MOMENT) What do you mean?\nCORNELIUS: this. Do you\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 51\nJO: (UPSET) These bodies! Did you know they were here?\nCORNELIUS: (DOING A FAIRLY GOOD JOB OF FAKING IT) Bodies... ? My God! What’s going on here? Did you just discover them? Who is at?\nJO: Jeremiah, his wife Claire and everyone else from the pub.\nCORNELIUS: Jenkins! Get some more men! We’ve got to get them ashore!\nSOLDIER: Sir!\nSOLDIER: SOLDIER RUNS OFF AT THE DOUBLE.\nCORNELIUS: (TO DOCTOR AND JO) Are they all dead?\nDOCTOR: I think so, don’t you?\nCORNELIUS: This is... terrible. I’d.. I’d better inform the local police officer.\nJO: Will he call the mainland?\nCORNELIUS: Of course. Of course.\nDOCTOR: And where’s that?\nCORNELIUS: What? Britain, of course.\nJO: Where in Britain?\nCORNELIUS: I’m afraid that’s top secret.\nDOCTOR: Oh, naturally.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 52\nCORNELIUS: There’1l be a full investigation. CID will probably send a team over on the next boat.\nDOCTOR: When is the next boat.\nCORNELIUS: Not until next Thursday, I’m afraid.\nJO: It’s just about Saturday morning now. Can’t you get them to send someone earlier than that? Or maybe send your helic—\nCORNELIUS: I’1l see what I can do.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS OF MEN APPROACHING.\nCORNELIUS: (TO THE MEN) Ah, there you are. Get these people out of the water on the double. If we get them to hospital in time, we may be able to save them.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS AND SOUNDS OF BODIES BEING BROUGHT ASHORE IN BACKGROUND.\nJO: Save them? Are you serious?\nCORNELIUS: Er.. well, you never know. Mustn’t abandon hope.\nDOCTOR: (HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS) Hmm. Quite. (BEAT) Captain, if everything is so top secret around here—\nCORNELIUS: (DEFENSIVE) Yes?\nDOCTOR: How do the locals cope? I presume they know the name of the nearest mainland port?\nCORNELIUS: The people here accepted everything long ago.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 53\nJO: ‘Accepted everything’?\nCORNELIUS: Their being here is part of our base’s camouflage.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nCORNELIUS: It’s a good protection against the prying eyes of foreign powers. Just a perfectly innocent fishing community.\nJO: And do you think the death of these people here is anything to do with foreign powers?\nCORNELIUS: It’s.. a possibility. We shall have to investigate.\nDOCTOR: Funny that no one has come out to see what all the fuss is about.\nJO: Good point. Not even any twitching curtains.\nJO: THE SOUNDS OF SEAGULLS DRIFTING IN.\nCORNELIUS: National Security. The people here know better than to ask questions.\nJO: Even when the bodies of about fifteen of their friends or family are being dragged ashore?\nCORNELIUS: I think it’s best if we take you to the base now. (STRIDES OFF) Jenkins!\nDOCTOR: Yes, why not? The sun’s coming up, and with poor Jeremiah and Claire dead, there’1ll be no breakfast at the Delphin Arms this morning.\nJO: (SOTTO) Bit of a lucky escape for our stomachs.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 54\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Jo...\nJO: (SOTTO) Sorry, that was in bad taste.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No, I didn’t mean that. Look behind you.\nJO: (SOTTO) At wh— ? Oh...\nJO: CORNELIUS RETURNS.\nCORNELIUS: (APPROACHING) Come along, that’s enough chatter. Let’s\nCORNELIUS: get you two into the Land Rover.\nJO: (SOTTO) Those fishing boats... They’re.. well, they’ re—\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Rotting, falling apart. So much for the ‘innocent fishing community’. Nobody’s been fishing in a long while on Delphin Isle.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 55\nDOCTOR: THE DISTINCTIVE DEEP THROB OF AIR CONDITIONING.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS OF SOLDIER 2 APPROACH.\nDOCTOR: KNOCK ON A DOOR.\nDOCTOR: NO RESPONSE.\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER KNOCK.\nDOCTOR: SOLDIER 2: Mr Hedgerton?\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER KNOCK. Mr Hedgerton, are you in there? ANOTHER KNOCK.\nDOCTOR: Mr Hedgerton, if you don’t open the door, I shall have to come in.\nDOCTOR: TRIES THE DOOR. IT’S LOCKED.\nDOCTOR: Mr Hedgerton, please unlock the door. You’re due on Level Zero-One. Commander Wingford’s orders.\nDOCTOR: KNOCKING LOUDER.\nDOCTOR: Mr Hedgerton, I can easily get a pass key. (PAUSE. SIGHS) Right, very well, if that’s the way you want to play it.\nDOCTOR: SOLDIER WALKS OFF DOWN THE CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: WE’RE AWARE OF HEDGERTON’S BREATHING CLOSE BY.\nHEDGERTON: (CLOSE, SOTTO. TO HIMSELF) Wingford’s orders. Wingford...\nHEDGERTON: No... Not Wingford’s orders... not Wingford’s orders...\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 56\nHEDGERTON: PHONE RINGS. IT’S PICKED UP.\nWINGFORD: Commander Wingford...\nWINGFORD: Yes. The vital component is now being shipped from the mainland— (LISTENS) Yes, the security protocols we activated remain unquestioned. (LISTENS) The Doctor and the girl are being brought here now. (LISTENS) Quite. All non-essential personnel must wear security masks. Understood. (LISTENS FOR A WHILE, THEN DRAWS BREATH) Well, they’re becoming suspicious, but there’s nothing they can do now.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 57\nWINGFORD: THE LAND ROVER MAKES ITS WAY OVER A GRAVELLY TRACK. SEAGULLS AND SEA IN THE BACKGROUND.\nWINGFORD: THE LAND ROVER THEN ENTERS A CAVE. REVERBERATING SOUND. SEAGULLS FADE INTO BACKGROUND.\nWINGFORD: LAND ROVER COMES TO A HALT. WE’RE AWARE OF THE GENTLE LAPPING OF A LARGE CAVE POOL. LAND ROVER DOORS OPEN. FOOTSTEPS ON SHINGLE.\nCORNELIUS: (ORDERING TO MEN) Bring the dinghy over!\nSOLDIER: (OBEDIENT) Sir!\nSOLDIER: SOLDIER DASHES OFF. IN BACKGROUND UNDER FOLLOWING, WE HEAR A DINGHY PULLED ‘ASHORE’.\nJO: Where exactly is your base... or are you about to put hoods\nJO: over our heads again?\nCORNELIUS: No need for that now.\nJO: Well that’s a relief.\nCORNELIUS: Please, into the boat.\nDOCTOR: Where are we going?\nJO: This is just a pool. It doesn’t lead anywhere.\nCORNELIUS: This way. You’1ll see.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Will we now?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 58 FOOTSTEPS ON SHINGLE AND WE HEAR THEM CLAMBER INTO THE BOAT.\nDOCTOR: (MOCK POLITENESS) Can I give you a hand, Miss Grant?\nJO: I can manage, ‘Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: (SMILES) Yes, you always could.\nDOCTOR: THEY’RE SITTING DOWN.\nCORNELIUS: All right, Jenkins, get us into position.\nSOLDIER: Sir.\nSOLDIER: GENTLE ROWING.\nDOCTOR: And what position would that be, Captain?\nDOCTOR: STATIC BURST OF WALKIE-TALKIE.\nCORNELIUS: (IGNORING DOCTOR) Cornelius to base. Activate.\nCORNELIUS: A BUBBLING, SUCKING SOUND AS THE WATER ALL AROUND THEM STARTS TO SWIRL AND BUBBLE. THE SOUND GETS GRADUALLY LOUDER.\nJO: (WARY) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Yes.. What exactly is going on, Captain Cornelius?\nCORNELIUS: Hold tight. Going down!\nCORNELIUS: THE RUSHING OF WATER GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 59\nCORNELIUS: THE DISTINCTIVE DEEP THROB OF AIR CONDITIONING.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS AS SOLDIER 2 APPROACHES HEDGERTON’S DOOR, KEYS JANGLING.\nCORNELIUS: SOLDIER 2:\nCORNELIUS: HE STOPS. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.\nCORNELIUS: SOLDIER 2:\nCORNELIUS: Now... I’ve got the pass keys with me this time, Mr Hedgerton.\nCORNELIUS: TRIES DOOR. IT’S LOCKED.\nCORNELIUS: Are you going to unlock the door now?\nCORNELIUS: KNOCK. NO REPLY.\nCORNELIUS: Right...\nCORNELIUS: JANGLE OF KEYS. ONE SELECTED. IT GOES INTO THE LOCK, TURNS. THE HANDLE IS TURNED AND THE DOOR OPENED.\nCORNELIUS: Now, then, let’s stop playing silly— (SEES NO ONE IS IN. SIGHS)\nCORNELIUS: WALKIE-TALKIE CLICK AND STATIC BURST. Level Zero-One, come in, please. Over.\nCORNELIUS: LEVEL ZERO-ONE VOICE: (DISTORT) Go ahead. Over.\nCORNELIUS: SOLDIER 2: You got Hedgerton down there, over?\nCORNELIUS: LEVEL ZERO-ONE VOICE: (DISTORT) No sign of him. Problem? Over?\nCORNELIUS: SOLIER 2: (SIGHS) Yeah, you could say that.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 60\nCORNELIUS: AREA.\nCORNELIUS: RUSHING OF WATER SUBSIDES.\nCORNELIUS: NOW THERE’S ONLY THE GENTLE LAPPING OF WATER. VERY LARGE REVERB ACOUSTIC. WATER DRIPPING.\nJO: (POST ORDEAL) That... that was incredible.\nDOCTOR: Ingenious.\nCORNELIUS: Amazing what the boffins come up with, isn’t it? They call it the ‘water elevator’.\nDOCTOR: Very apt. Your cave pool was in fact the surface of a deep, man-made bore-hole.\nJO: And somehow the water got sucked down... and us with it.\nCORNELIUS: Takes us down about three hundred feet or more below the surface. All done with massive pumps a few levels down.\nDOCTOR: You’ve gone to a lot of trouble to stop people finding you.\nCORNELIUS: Of course. Take us in, Jenkins.\nCORNELIUS: ROWING STARTS. BOAT BUMPS ALONGSIDE A METAL JETTY. FOOTSTEPS SCRAMBLE OUT ONTO METAL GRATING OF JETTY.\nCORNELIUS: (AS HE GETS OUT OF BOAT) Let me help you out. (SOUNDS OF EFFORT)\nJO: (CLIMBING ONTO JETTY) Thank you.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING ONTO JETTY) Much obliged, Captain.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 61\nDOCTOR: LARGE WATER-SEAL DOOR IS YANKED OPEN. THEY WALK THROUGH INTO ADJOINING AREA.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor... Miss Grant. Welcome to Delphin Base. (THE REST OF THE SPEECH FADES UNDER) Now, if you’1ll follow me, we've got quite a walk to the Commander’s office. It’1ll take us past some quite hazardous areas, so I’1l thank you not to deviate from the route. Then we’ll be taking the lift up to the command level. This way, please.\nCORNELIUS: DURING THIS, WE CROSS-FADE TO A POSITION, SOME WAY OFF, WHERE HEDGERTON IS SECRETLY WATCHING THEM.\nCORNELIUS: WE HEAR HIS RAGGED BREATHING.\nHEDGERTON: (MURMURING TO HIMSELF) National Security... it’s all... all for national... (A MUFFLED STAB OF PAIN) Urgh. No... You’re new.. you two. New. Not like us. You haven’t defected yet.\nHEDGERTON: CROSS-FADE BACK TO CORNELIUS, THE DOCTOR AND JO. IN THE BACKGROUND, OTHER FOOTSTEPS.\nDOCTOR: Who are those people over there?\nCORNELIUS: Base personnel. Our workforce. Some of the locals work here.\nDOCTOR: They’re wearing protective clothing.\nJO: Are those anti-radiation masks?\nCORNELIUS: Just a precaution.\nDOCTOR: A precaution against what?\nCORNELIUS: Radiation, of course.\nDOCTOR: What kind of radiation. From where?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 62\nCORNELIUS: (IGNORING THE QUESTION) This way.\nDOCTOR: What, the radiation?\nCORNELIUS: If you’d walk this way, please.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE. Thank you. THEY CONTINUE WALKING FOR A WHILE.\nJO: (SOTTO) I don’t like the feel of this place.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Neither do I, Jo. Neither do I.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 63\nDOCTOR: PHONE RINGS. IT’S ANSWERED.\nWINGFORD: Commander Wingford...\nWINGFORD: HE LISTENS.\nWINGFORD: He’s what? But I thought he was on his way down to level Zero-One? (LISTENS) But how— ? Oh, never mind. Just make sure you find him and get him down there, do you under— ? KNOCK AT DOOR.\nWINGFORD: I’1l call you back.\nWINGFORD: PHONE SLAMMED DOWN.\nWINGFORD: Come in.\nWINGFORD: DOOR OPENS. FOOTSTEPS OF THE DOCTOR, JO AND CORNELIUS.\nCORNELIUS: The Doctor and Miss Grant, sir.\nWINGORD: (ALL SMILES) Ah, welcome, welcome... I’m Commander Wingford. Please do excuse all this cloak and dagger business.\nDOCTOR: Ah, so we’re about to get some answers, are we?\nWINGFORD: (AFFABLE) Er.. All in good time, all in good time.\nJO: (ANNOYED) Good time? We’ve been kept in the dark ever since—\nWINGFORD: Um, can we get you anything? Tea?\nJO: No thanks.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 64\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t happen to have any really sour beer, would you?\nWINGFORD: (WRONG-FOOTED) Er... I’m sorry?\nJO: (TRYING NOT TO LAUGH) Or some luke-warm tinned food?\nDOCTOR: (DEADPAN) Oh yes, that’d be lovely.\nWINGFORD: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) I was very sorry to hear of your disturbing experience on the quayside. Very distressing news.\nDOCTOR: Has that sort of thing ever happened on the island before?\nWINGFORD: No. Never. Why should it? Everything’s very peaceful and normal here.\nJO: Have the police been informed yet?\nCORNELIUS: (RATHER TOO QUICKLY) Yes, they have been.\nJO: Oh, and when did you do that? We’ve been with you ever since you said you’d call them.\nCORNELIUS: I detailed my sergeant to do it. We’re trying to arrange for an earlier boat over for the CID — but the weather forecast isn’t too good and it gets very choppy out here.\nDOCTOR: Does it indeed?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 65\nWINGFORD: Yes, I’m afraid it does. Too rough for the helicopter. During the stormy season, we’re sometimes holed up here for weeks without fresh supplies.\nDOCTOR: Still, I’m sure you’ve lots to distract you here.\nJO: Yes. There seems to be a lot going on. We saw quite a large number of personnel on our way here.\nDOCTOR: They seemed very busy indeed.\nJO: What were they doing?\nJO: PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: Well?\nJO: (CONFIDENT BLUFF) As members of UNIT, I must remind you that we have the highest security clearance. I’m afraid I must insist on knowing what goes on in this base and why you’ve brought us here.\nWINGFORD: Of course.\nJO: Oh... really?\nWINGFORD: Yes, Captain Cornelius here will escort you on a full tour of our operations, Miss Grant. I think we’d find your input very valuable.\nJO: You would?\nWINGFORD: And if you’1l excuse me, I’m rather keen to monopolise the Doctor’s time here in my office.\nDOCTOR: Um... I think I’d like to take the tour too.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 66\nWINGFORD: Naturally. But there are certain, specialist, scientific matters that I’d like you to take a look at first, Doctor. You can join Miss Grant afterwards.\nJO: (WARY) I’d.. I’d rather the Doctor came with me.\nCORNELIUS: It’s just that the Brigadier is anxious to see you straight away, Miss Grant.\nJO: (TAKEN ABACK) The Brigadier?\nWINGFORD: Yes. Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, your commanding officer. He arrived on Delphin Isle shortly before you did. He’s been with us since last night.\nJO: But.. The Brigadier’s in Geneva.\nCORNELIUS: He was until yesterday, yes. Now he’s here, overseeing\nCORNELIUS: some of our urgent security matters.\nDOCTOR: What ‘urgent security matters’?\nWINGFORD: We'll leave that for him to explain to you.\nDOCTOR: Can I speak to him now?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. I really think I should. Don’t you?\nWINGFORD: Of course. Cornelius?\nCORNELIUS: (OBEDIENT) Sir.\nCORNELIUS: STATIC BURST OF WALKIE-TALKIE.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 67\nCORNELIUS: Captain Cornelius to Level Zero-One.\nCORNELIUS: LEVEL ZERO-ONE VOICE: (HEAVY DISTORT) Receiving.\nWINGFORD: Sorry, Signal’s a bit dodgy in the lower levels.\nCORNELIUS: Put Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart on, please. The Doctor wishes to speak to him.\nCORNELIUS: DISTORT SOUNDS OF WALKIE TALKIE BEING HANDED OVER.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor (HANDING WALKIE-TALKIE TO HIM)\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Hello? Brigadier? Brigadier?\nDOCTOR: HEAVY STATIC.\nDOCTOR: You recognise my voice?\nDOCTOR: HEAVY STATIC.\nJO: Bu—\nDOCTOR: Miss Grant and I are here. Commander Wingford wants Jo to come down and join you.\nDOCTOR: MUCH STATIC AND FRAGMENTS OF DISCONNECTED SPEECH.\nDOCTOR: Brigadier? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: MORE STATIC.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 68\nWINGFORD: (AFFABLY) Signal’s terrible, I’m afraid. The one thing our boffins haven’t been able to fix. The phone lines are corroded and you can’t argue with solid granite.\nBRIGADIER VOICE: (HEAVY DISTORT) That’s quite all right, Doctor. Out. (Or\nBRIGADIER VOICE: similar phrase gleaned from archive)\nJO: (VERY WARY) Doctor... ?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps Miss Grant can wait here with me and—\nCORNELIUS: We really do have quite a tight schedule to run.\nJO: (POINTED) Well if it’s so tight, why did you waste time putting us in that pub last night? Well?\nWINGORD: I’m afraid matters are coming to rather a head this morning, Miss Grant.\nDOCTOR: What ‘matters’?\nWINGFORD: (POLITE BUT FIRMER) That’s precisely what we wish to explain to you, Doctor. Which is why I really must insist that Miss Grant goes with Captain Cornelius now to see the Brigadier and that you stay here with me. It’s a matter of National—\nJO: — National Security? Yes, we know.\nDOCTOR: (SENSING DANGER. CALMING HER) Jo.. I think we’d better do as the Commander wishes. Trust me.\nJO: Trust— ?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERS) I don’t think we have any choice.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 69\nJO: (CONTAINING HERSELF) Okay. If you’re sure... Doctor. (SHE’S STILL NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED HE’S THE DOCTOR)\nCORNELIUS: This way, please, Miss Grant.\nJO: Very well.\nDOCTOR: And, Jo?\nJO: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Give the Brigadier my regards, won’t you? And be sure to remind him, he can ‘tell it to the marines’.\nJO: Wh— ?\nDOCTOR: It’s... a little joke of ours.\nWINGFORD: A joke?\nDOCTOR: Yes, a joke. You know all about jokes, don’t you, Commander?\nWINGFORD: Of course. Very... amusing.\nJO: See you later, Doctor.\nJO: FOOTSTEPS AS SHE AND CORNELIUS LEAVE. DOOR CLOSES.\nWINGFORD: Now then, Doctor—\nDOCTOR: Yes, Commander Wingford. What precisely can I assist you with?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 70\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS ALONG STONE CORRIDOR.\nJO: So, how long have you been serving on this island, Captain?\nCORNELIUS: Quite a while, Miss Grant. That’s all I’m at liberty to—\nJO: Is everything classified information around here?\nCORNELIUS: Pretty much.\nJO: But you are going to tell me what this base is for now?\nCORNELIUS: I have now been authorised to do that.\nJO: Go on, then.\nCORNELIUS: This base was established during the Cold War as a top secret debriefing safe haven for high-ranking defectors.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 71\nDOCTOR: Defectors?\nWINGFORD: Yes. The kind of high-ranking defectors that we wanted the Soviets to think had simply vanished or died.\nDOCTOR: What better place? An island that no one knew existed.\nWINGFORD: Precisely.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs\nWINGFORD: LIFT DESCENDING.\nJO: So what’s on this ‘level Zero-One’ ?\nCORNELIUS: You'll see.\nJO: And what’s it got to do with UNIT?\nCORNELIUS: Page 72\nCORNELIUS: There are certain... unique security concerns which have\nCORNELIUS: arisen. And UNIT’s unique skill set seemed...\nJO: In what way?\nCORNELIUS: The.. Brigadier will explain.\nCORNELIUS: LIFT CONTINUES TO DESCEND.\nJO: It’s a long way down.\nCORNELIUS: A very long way.\nCORNELIUS: appropriate.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 73\nWINGFORD: Back in 1951, an experimental Soviet craft ditched in the sea just off the island.\nDOCTOR: Were you expecting it to do that?\nWINGFORD: (LYING REASONABLY WELL) Er... yes.\nDOCTOR: And did it contain a high-ranking defector?\nWINGFORD: Lt .daid.,\nDOCTOR: And is that defector still here?\nWINGFORD: He is. Yes. And so is the craft.\nDOCTOR: The craft survived the crash?\nWINGFORD: Not entirely. But we salvaged most of it. The pilot has been helping us to rebuild it.\nDOCTOR: Rebuild it? Since 1951?\nWINGFORD: And that’s the trouble.\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nWINGFORD: He is, well, very old now.\nDOCTOR: How old?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 74\nWINGFORD: In fact.. he’s on life support, down at level Zero. I’m afraid our medics say he doesn’t have much longer to live.\nDOCTOR: So you want my help with this craft?\nWINGFORD: You're very perceptive. Yes. Your record with UNIT suggested you had the perfect skills for the job.\nDOCTOR: So why all this, as you put it, ‘cloak and dagger business’? Why not just come right out and ask me? Well?\nWINGFORD: (NOW STRUGGLING SLIGHTLY TO EXPLAIN) We... we wanted to make sure that you were... comfortable.\nDOCTOR: Comfortable? In a pub where the beer was poisonous and the food barely edible?\nWINGFORD: (GENUINELY CONFUSED) Er... I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: A pub whose landlord and landlady, along with all their customers, end up floating dead in the harbour?\nWINGFORD: Um... as I say, that was most regrettable. But—\nDOCTOR: Regrettable? Mass suicide? Mass murder? Which do you\nDOCTOR: think it is, Commander?\nWINGFORD: That is a matter for the police to determine.\nDOCTOR: The police who won’t be arriving until next Thursday. But you must have an opinion, surely, Commander.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: Well?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 75\nWINGFORD: As a matter of fact... (HESITATES)\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nWINGFORD: I do not.\nDOCTOR: No opinion on the matter at all?\nWINGFORD: No. My concern is for you to help us in the final phase of reconstruction of this craft.\nDOCTOR: You’re a remarkably single-minded fellow, aren’t you?\nWINGFORD: I.. have my duty to perform. In the interests of—\nDOCTOR: — National Security, so you and Captain Cornelius keep on saying. (BEAT) Tell me, Commander, just how ‘experimental’ is this crashed Soviet craft?\nWINGFORD: Its drive mechanisms are unique on this planet.\nDOCTOR: Unique on this planet? That’s an interesting way of putting it.\nWINGFORD: It is.. a very interesting craft. We need you to help us complete the work on it.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 76\nWINGFORD: LIFT DESCENDS AND STOPS.\nWINGFORD: LIFT DOORS OPEN.\nJO: So you want the Doctor to help you with this old Soviet\nJO: plane?\nCORNELIUS: That’s right.\nCORNELIUS: JO AND CORNELIUS’S FOOTSTEPS EXIT AND STOP.\nJO: And... this is Level Zero-One, then?\nCORNELIUS: Tt: is.\nCORNELIUS: AWKWARD PAUSE.\nJO: So.. where’s the Brigadier?\nCORNELIUS: Through there.\nJO: Where? Behind those doors?\nCORNELIUS: Yes.\nJO: Looks... er.. sort of airtight. Like a water tank or something.\nCORNELIUS: I suppose it does. Yes. This far down, there’s a risk of flooding, so we have to be careful.\nJO: And... the Brigadier’s in there.\nCORNELIUS: Yes.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 77\nCORNELIUS: I believe that’s him, isn’t it?\nJO: Yes.. Well, it certainly sounds like him.\nCORNELIUS: Well then, after you.\nCORNELIUS: HE TURNS THE WHEEL HANDLE ON THE LARGE DOOR. IT HISSES\nCORNELIUS: SLIGHTLY AS IT YAWNS OPEN.\nCORNELIUS: (SLIGHTLY MORE INSISTENT) After you. Miss Grant.\nCORNELIUS: JO WALKS IN THROUGH DOOR.\nJO: Thank you. (AS SHE ENTERS) Brigadier? We had no idea were already...\nJO: CROSS-FADE TO...\nJO: you\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 78\nJO: METALLIC, CONFINED ACOUSTIC.\nJO: (TRAILS OFF) .. here— Hey, wait a minute, there’s nobody in— [here]\nJO: DOOR WINDING TO CLOSE VERY QUICKLY.\nCORNELIUS: (CALLING FROM OUTSIDE) You won’t have to wait long!\nCORNELIUS: aon long? Wait long for wh— ? Where’s the Briga— ? [dier]\nCORNELIUS: DOOR SLAMS SHUT.\nCORNELIUS: Captain Cornelius! Open this door!\nCORNELIUS: SHE THUMPS THE DOOR. IT IS VERY SOLID METAL. Captain!?! Just what do you think you’re playing at? SILENCE.\nCORNELIUS: THEN SHE MOVES AROUND ON THE METAL FLOOR.\nJO: There isn’t another way out.\nJO: SLOWLY, A GURGLING, SURGING SOUND OF SOME VAST MASS OF VISCOUS FLUID FADES IN.\nJO: What’s going on? Captain! Captain Cornelius!!! There’s... urgh...\nJO: THE GURGLING FLUID STARTS TO GUSH IN.\nJO: It’s... what is this stuff? This isn’t water, it’s sticky and— Captain! Open the door! OPEN THE DOOR!\nJO: STICKY, GURGLING RUSHING...\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 79\nJO: A DRAWER OPENED AND A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER ROLLED OUT.\nWINGFORD: These are the original design drawings we made of the crashed craft’s drive systems.\nDOCTOR: Really? (STUDYING THEM) Yes, you were right. They’re highly advanced.\nDOCTOR: PHONE RINGS.\nWINGFORD: Excuse me.\nDOCTOR: (ENGROSSED) Of course.\nDOCTOR: PHONE IS PICKED UP.\nWINGFORD: (ANSWERING PHONE) Commander Wingford... (HE LISTENS) Good. Thank you, Cornelius.\nWINGFORD: HE PUTS THE PHONE DOWN.\nDOCTOR: Everything all right?\nWINGFORD: That was Cornelius.\nDOCTOR: So I gathered. How’s Jo?\nWINGFORD: All is well.\nDOCTOR: Is she with the Brigadier now?\nWINGFORD: Yes. She is.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 80\nWINGFORD: THE GURGLE AND BUBBLE OF THE VISCOUS FLUID. THE CHAMBER IS ALMOST FULL NOW.\nJO: (CHOKING AND GAGGING) Ugh! Captain Cornelius! For goodness sake— !\nJO: SUDDENLY A METAL HATCH SQUEALS AND CLANGS OPEN. What— ?\nHEDGERTON: (AGITATED. HARSH WHISPER) Quickly! Reach up! Take my hand!\nJO: But— who are you? What are you doing up there?\nHEDGERTON: It’s the only way out! I discovered it a few years ago.\nJO: Years— ?\nHEDGERTON: Quickly, before its too late! Come on!\nJO: Where’s Captain Cornelius?\nHEDGERTON: He won’t help you. He wants you to be engulfed.\nJO: ‘Engulfed’?\nHEDGERTON: For pity’s sake, grab my hand, girl!\nJO: All right. (EFFORT AS SHE STRETCHES UP)\nHEDGERTON: (GASPS WITH EFFORT AS HE GRABS HER ARM) Got you... That’s it. Now.. (EFFORT AS HE PULLS HER UP)\nHEDGERTON: JO IS PULLED UP THROUGH THE HATCHWAY.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 81\nHEDGERTON: THE LIQUID SURGES UPWARDS.\nHEDGERTON: JO & HEDGERTON:\nHEDGERTON: Just in time. The chamber’s almost full of it.\nJO: But what is it? It looks like... I dunno, a sort of blue gloop. And where’s the Brigadier?\nHEDGERTON: There is no Brigadier. Just recordings. They tricked you. Out of the way, while I close the hatch.\nHEDGERTON: IT CLANGS SHUT.\nHEDGERTON: CUT TO...\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 82\nHEDGERTON: CONTINUOUS.\nHEDGERTON: CONFINED, METALLIC ACOUSTIC.\nHEDGERTON: Now then, let me see... (EXAMINING HER FACE)\nJO: What are you doing? Get your hands off my face!\nHEDGERTON: Sssh, ssh. Quietly now. If we’re very unlucky, they may hear us, and I just need to check... (LOOKING) No, none of it got into your mouth, eyes, ears or nose. You should be all right.\nJO: Should I? What about you? Your skin is completely blue.\nHEDGERTON: Yes, I know... but fading... fading... I.. I think it takes a while.. a while to fade. But then, the skin ages...\nJO: Look, what’s really going on in this base? Why did Cornelius lock me in that chamber?\nHEDGERTON: (HIS MIND DRIFTING) Hmmm? They’re all defectors, you see.\nJO: What? Who are?\nHEDGERTON: All of them. Everyone here in this base. Everyone on Delphin Isle. All... defectors.\nJO: You mean... from the Cold War days?\nHEDGERTON: Hm? That’s when it started, yes.\nJO: When what started?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 83\nHEDGERTON: But it’s getting weaker now. Weaker. Getting weaker every day...\nJO: That stuff? That... fluid?\nHEDGERTON: Yes. Weak enough, over the years, for me to find the strength to miss one submersion.\nJO: Miss one? You mean... You’ve actually been submerged in that stuff?\nHEDGERTON: Yes.. many times... over the years... But after I missed one... I found... I found I started to remember things. I found I started to have the strength to... to...\nJO: The strength to do what?\nJO: PAUSE.\nHEDGERTON: To be myself. To be the real Hedgerton again.\nJO: Hedgerton? Is that your name?\nHEDGERTON: Yes. Who I really was came back to me in small ways to start with. And the more you fight, the more.. the more... (A NOISE OF FRUSTRATION) I get confused. But things are beginning to get clearer now. Beginning... (WITH DREAD) And I won’t go back in there. (BEAT) But when I saw them bringing you.. you and your friend here...\nJO: Me and the Doctor, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Doctor... ? Yes. I knew I had to stop them from turning you into Defectors.\nJO: What are Defectors? What’s going on in this place?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 84\nHEDGERTON: Defectors... This place was all about defectors, but...\nHEDGERTON: That’s what we all became. (BEAT) You say you want know what’s going on?\nJO: Yes, of course.\nHEDGERTON: Then I’1l1 show you what I can. Come with me.\nHEDGERTON: HE STARTS TO SHUFFLE ALONG THE DUCT.\nHEDGERTON: to\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 85\nHEDGERTON: MAP SHIFTED AND REPOSITIONED ON THE DESK.\nWINGFORD: So, do you think you can help us, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well... I wonder if you can help me first.\nWINGFORD: How? What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Well... This...\nDOCTOR: PLAN SHIFTS ON TABLE. These drawings aren’t quite ‘drawings’, are they?\nWINGFORD: Aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: No.. And this isn’t quite paper, is it?\nWINGFORD: (BLUFFING) Ah, yes, well, it’s a top secret material. And a top secret method of—\nDOCTOR: Top secret, top secret, top secret... Everything’s so top secret, isn’t it?\nWINGFORD: Well... naturally.\nDOCTOR: And you want to know what I think of this... craft and its propulsion system?\nWINGFORD: We do.\nDOCTOR: It would seem the Russians were working on something far more complex than just a superior jet aeroplane.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 86\nDOCTOR: CONFINED, METALLIC ACOUSTIC. THEY ARE BOTH STRUGGLING ALONG.\nJO: Hedgerton.. Hedgerton, wait. Stop.\nJO: THEY STOP.\nJO: (GETS HER BREATH BACK) Look... Where are you taking us?\nHEDGERTON: I.. I must show you. Show you what’s going on. Don’t you see? It’s best if I show you, so you believe me.\nJO: Right. Okay. But I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff in my time and you’d be surprised what I can believe. When you hang around with the Doctor for any length of time, you—\nHEDGERTON: What is your name? Did you tell me?\nJO: Wha— ? Er, no, no, I don’t think I did. Why do you want to know?\nHEDGERTON: You know mine.\nJO: Um... fair enough. Sorry. I’m Jo Grant. Pleased to meet you, Mr Hedgerton.\nHEDGERTON: Jo... Jo. Yes. I like that name.\nJO: Oh... well, good.\nHEDGERTON: Jo, help me to remove this panel here.\nHEDGERTON: JO & HEDGERTON: (NOISES OF EFFORT AS THEY REMOVE A METAL PANEL FROM THE DUCT. )\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 87\nHEDGERTON: PANEL IS GENTLY PLACED INSIDE THE DUCT.\nJO: Now wha— ?\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Sssh. They will hear you.\nJO: (WHISPER) Oh. Sorry. These... Defectors, you mean?\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Yes... Look, down there, through all the pipes and structures. There.\nHEDGERTON: SLOWLY FADE UP THE SOUNDS OF MANY FOOTSTEPS ON METAL GRATING AND LADDERS.\nJO: (WHISPER. SQUINTING) Down there in the dark... I can see... Loads of people. A hundred or more... The Doctor and I saw some of them. People working on that plane, I guess. They were wearing masks before.\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Only so you wouldn’t see the blue of their skin. They’re not in masks now.\nHEDGERTON: FOOTSTEPS NEARER BY.\nJO: (WHISPER) Look, there are some coming this way.\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Get back or they’1ll see you.\nJO: (WHISPER) Wait a minute... I recognise... That’s Claire... Claire from the pub... and her husband Jeremiah. (BEAT) But they were drowned. I saw them. They were dead.\nJO: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 88\nJO: PART THREE.\nJO: FOOTSTEPS NEARER BY.\nJO: (WHISPER) Look, there are some coming this way.\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Get back or they’1ll see you.\nJO: (WHISPER) Wait a minute... I recognise... That’s Claire... Claire from the pub... and her husband Jeremiah. (BEAT) But they were drowned. I saw them. They were dead.\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER) Keep back...\nHEDGERTON: FOOTSTEPS PASS. They’ve gone.\nJO: But... how can they be alive?\nHEDGERTON: You saw them in the water?\nJO: Yes. Drowned.\nHEDGERTON: They weren’t drowned... They were sleeping.\nJO: Sleeping? They weren’t sleeping. They weren’t breathing and their skin was so blue—\nHEDGERTON: Everyone on this island has blue skin.\nJO: Everyone? But not Wingford and Corneli— Wait a minute, the Doctor said Cornelius was wearing make-up.\nHEDGERTON: They are trying to conceal their blue skin from you.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 89\nJO: But why?\nHEDGERTON: I’m not sure... I don’t know.\nJO: And if it’s this blue stuff that makes you all blue, what’s the point of it?\nHEDGERTON: To make us... (SEARCHING FOR THE WORD)... to make us... compliant.\nJO: You mean, someone’s controlling you?\nHEDGERTON: Not exactly that... It’s difficult for me.. difficult for me to describe.\nJO: Okay, okay... but where does it come from? This blue stuff.\nJO: It scares you, doesn’t it? Hedgerton, it’s all right.\nHEDGERTON: No. It isn’t. Not since they came here.\nJO: Who came here?\nHEDGERTON: (LOST IN MEMORIES) I remember... I remember... It was... was a bright, sunlit day. The sea.. the sea was calm. I... I felt so young. The warmth... the breeze upon my face.\nJO: This happened a long time ago?\nHEDGERTON: It feels like a story... a story someone else has told me... But it was me. My life. I’m starting to become more and more sure of that.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 90\nJO: Tell me the rest of the story, Hedgerton.\nHEDGERTON: Hm? Ah, well... they brought it ashore.\nJO: Brought what ashore? Hedgerton?\nHEDGERTON: It was blue... It glinted in the sun... bigger than any\nHEDGERTON: aeroplane I’d seen before.\nJO: The Russian plane?\nHEDGERTON: No. Not a plane—\nHEDGERTON: ALARM SUDDENLY BLARES OUT.\nJO: Oh no. What does that mean? They’ve found us?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 91\nJO: VERY DISTANT, MUFFLED ALARM.\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nWINGFORD: Hm? Oh... it’s a shift change in the lower levels. We can’t have the locals cooped up underground for too long. We like to look after them.\nDOCTOR: (NOT REALLY BELIEVING HIM) I see... (BEAT) This ‘Russian’ drive system is an incredible piece of work. Really rather beautiful.\nWINGFORD: (EAGER) You understand the principles of its operation?\nDOCTOR: Yes.. yes, I think I do.\nWINGFORD: (PLEASED) We knew you would.\nDOCTOR: I presume your aim is to reactivate it.\nWINGFORD: Of course.\nDOCTOR: And how close to that are you now?\nWINGFORD: We.. are close. But there is a small number of technical difficulties we still haven’t conquered.\nDOCTOR: I’d need to see documentation of all your work so far. I take it you’d keep that here...\nDOCTOR: HE PULLS OPEN A FILING CABINET DRAWER.\nDOCTOR: In these files.\nWINGFORD: Er... yes, but.. (COMES TO A DECISION) Please, be my guest.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Page 92\nDOCTOR: HE RUMMAGES IN THE DRAWERS. PULLS OUT A PHOTOGRAPH.\nDOCTOR: Oh, what’s this?\nWINGFORD: Um... a photograph. But never mind about— [that]\nDOCTOR: Lt sof you; .2sn*t: 1b?\nWINGFORD: (UNCONCERNED) Is it?\nDOCTOR: Yes, look. Down on the quayside.\nDOCTOR: the fuselage they’re winching up?\nWINGFORD: I believe so.\nDOCTOR: Beautiful day. Was it summer?\nWINGFORD: (A TAD CONFUSED) Summer? No... no... those freak days in late Autumn...\nWINGFORD: shone. I think I got sunburnt.\nDOCTOR: But not today?\nWINGFORD: By the crane. Is this\nWINGFORD: I.. I think it was one of Out of nowhere... the sun\nWINGFORD: (CAUGHT IN REMEMBRANCE MOMENTARILY) Hm? No... not today—\nWINGFORD: (SNAPPING OUT) What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: No sign of sunburn on your face today. Just a nice, matt\nDOCTOR: complexion.\nWINGFORD: No chance of getting sunburnt down here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Still, you look healthy enough. And exactly the same as\nDOCTOR: you did in 1951.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 93\nWINGFORD: (BEMUSED) Er.. yes. Anyway, you should find the documents\nWINGFORD: you require in the next drawer down.\nDOCTOR: Of course...\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH IS PULLED OUT. Oh look, here’s one of Captain Cornelius.\nWINGFORD: Yes... probably, but—\nDOCTOR: Taken on the same day. And isn’t that Claire and\nDOCTOR: in the background? All looking the same—\nWINGFORD: Probably. The next drawer down?\nDOCTOR: Sorry.. I was allowing myself to be distracted by...\nDOCTOR: (POINTEDLY) irrelevant details. Back to work.\nDOCTOR: Jeremiah\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 94\nDOCTOR: ALARM IS STILL SOUNDING.\nJO: If that alarm’s for us... Why haven’t we been spotted yet?\nJO: ALARM STOPS.\nJO: What is it? What’s the matter?\nHEDGERTON: It wasn’t for us. It was for them...\nHEDGERTON: FOOTSTEPS TRUDGING PAST ON THE METAL GRATING BELOW.\nJO: (WHISPER) They’re heading back the way we came... Back...\nHEDGERTON: (WHISPER. WITH DREAD.) To the chamber...\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 95\nHEDGERTON: CHAMBER.\nHEDGERTON: FOOTSTEPS OF ABOUT TEN PEOPLE AS THEY WALK ACROSS THE METAL GRATING.\nHEDGERTON: THE CHAMBER DOOR OPENS AS BEFORE.\nCORNELIUS: This way. In here, please. Thank you.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS THROUGH DOORWAY AND INTO THE CHAMBER. DOOR CLOSES BEHIND THEM.\nCORNELIUS: Begin.\nCORNELIUS: CUT TO...\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 96\nCORNELIUS: AS BEFORE, WE HEAR THE GOOEY FLUID SURGING UP THROUGH THE GRATING, BUBBLING UP DISTURBINGLY TO SMOTHER THE MICROPHONE.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 97\nCORNELIUS: SOME OF THE GURGLING CAN BE HEARD REVERBERATING FAINTLY DOWN THE DUCT.\nJO: (WHISPER) That’s horrible. All of them.. all those people...\nHEDGERTON: (WEEPING) Submerged...\nJO: (WHISPER) So that they’11l continue to be... compliant?\nHEDGERTON: (THROUGH TEARS) Yes.\nJO: (WHISPER. DETERMINED) Hedgerton, where does this fluid come from? Tell me.\nHEDGERTON: There is a pipeline.\nJO: A pipeline? Where?\nHEDGERTON: I’1ll show you. We must climb out of the duct.\nJO: But—\nHEDGERTON: It’ll be safe. It’ll be a while before they leave the chamber. This way. Come on.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 98\nHEDGERTON: MORE OF THE PLANS ROLLED OUT AND PUT ON THE TABLE.\nDOCTOR: (ENGROSSED) So, from what I can see, you’ve reconstructed the entire drive system. All that’s left is for the power couplings to be aligned. And the energy from these fuel stacks needs to be initialised.\nWINGFORD: Yes.. That is what I’ve been told by our... engineers.\nDOCTOR: Would you like me to calculate the alignment?\nWINGFORD: You can do that?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. (STALLING) But er... it might take me quite\nDOCTOR: a while.\nDOCTOR: A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL ARE PULLED OUT OF A DESK BY WINGFORD.\nWINGFORD: Then perhaps you would oblige us by starting now.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see what I can do, shall we?\nDOCTOR: KNOCK AT THE DOOR.\nWINGFORD: Come!\nWINGFORD: DOOR OPENS.\nWINGFORD: Cornelius... Is all well?\nCORNELIUS: EY...\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter, Captain?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 99\nWINGFORD: Is there something the matter, Captain?\nCORNELIUS: (COVERING) Nothing to worry about, sir.\nWINGFORD: Well?\nCORNELIUS: I.. I seem to have lost Miss Grant.\nDOCTOR: Really? Oh, I expect she and the Brigadier have sneaked off somewhere to have a cup of tea.\nCORNELIUS: No— (STOPS HIMSELF. THEN FORCES AFFABILITY) Yes... yes, of course. You’re probably right.\nDOCTOR: Did Jo give the Brigadier my message? My little joke?\nCORNELIUS: (LYING NOT QUITE WELL ENOUGH) Yes. He found it... most amusing.\nDOCTOR: Oh good. The Brigadier and I like a good laugh, you know.\nCORNELIUS: Mm. Er, Commander, may I have a word with you in private?\nWINGFORD: EY...\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t mind me, I have my calculations to complete.\nWINGFORD: Thank you, Doctor. This way, Captain. I believe my adjutant’s office is free.\nWINGFORD: THEY WALK OFF. A DIFFERENT DOOR IS OPENED AND THEY LEAVE. SHUTTING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) So... you got away, did you, Jo? Good girl.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 100\nDOCTOR: FOREGROUND, A PUMPING, SQUELCHING SOUND FROM WITHIN A (TRANSPARENT) PIPE.\nDOCTOR: TENTATIVE FOOTSTEPS OF JO AND HEDGERTON APPROACH. THEIR TONES ARE HUSHED.\nHEDGERTON: (APPROACHING) This is it. This is the pipeline.\nJO: Full of that blue stuff... yuk. I can see it leads off in the direction of that chamber I got trapped in... But where does it come from.. ? Ah, down here.\nHEDGERTON: (WITH GROWING DREAD) Yes... down to Level Zero.\nJO: What’s on Level Zero?\nHEDGERTON: I.. I can’t... remember... I.. it’s a blank in my mind, but...\nJO: But what? Come on, Hedgerton. Surely you can remember. You said you’ve been remembering more and more... Just try to think.\nHEDGERTON: (AN INVOLUNTARY YELP) I can’t. But... I know... I know... that it’s something (WITH DREAD) terrible.\nJO: Then we’ve got to find out what it is. The Doctor — if he is the Doctor — is still being held captive upstairs. And if whoever is using this blue stuff to control everyone is down on Level Zero, then that’s where we’ve got to go. We've got to find out what we’re up against. That’s what the Doctor, my Doctor, would’ve done. (BEAT) So, Hedgerton... will you take me there? Hedgerton?\nHEDGERTON: (STEELING HIMSELF) Yes. I will.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 101\nHEDGERTON: WINGFORD AND CORNELIUS SPEAK IN HUSHED, URGENT TONES.\nWINGFORD: There is clearly a connection between the disappearance of Hedgerton and the girl.\nCORNELIUS: Why?\nWINGFORD: Because Hedgerton somehow found a way of avoiding the submersions. He was free when the Doctor and Miss Grant entered the base. He must have seen them. He is making mischief.\nCORNELIUS: There is nothing they can do to disrupt anything.\nWINGFORD: I hope you’re right, Cornelius.\nCORNELIUS: We should waste no more time with the Doctor. He must undergo submersion.\nWINGFORD: No. We need the Doctor’s mind fully in tact.\nCORNELIUS: But he is a danger to us. He is... sharper than we are. I sense that he understands more than we do. He knows humans and their behavioural patterns too well. I believe he suspects—\nWINGFORD: It doesn’t matter! The repair and activation of the ship is all that matters. And for that, we need his—\nWINGFORD: DOOR OPENS. DOCTOR’S FOOTSTEPS ENTER.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Sorry to interrupt. Is anything the matter?\nDOCTOR: Only I heard raised voices. Can I help at all?\nWINGFORD: Have you finished your calculations?\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 102\nDOCTOR: Not quite.\nCORNELIUS: (ENRAGED) He’s procrastinating. Trying to trick us— (A NOISE OF EFFORT AS HE GRABS THE DOCTOR).\nDOCTOR: (GASPS IN PAIN AS HE’S GRABBED) Time for the rough stuff, is it, Captain?\nWINGFORD: Don’t damage him.\nDOCTOR: How thoughtful of you, Commander. (HE’S RELEASED) Thank you, Captain.\nCORNELIUS: (INSISTENT) Can you fix the.. plane or not?\nDOCTOR: I believe I can successfully complete my calculations, if that’s what you mean. But as for the power needed— (INTERRUPTING HIMSELF) By the way, I’m sure you already knew, but it isn’t a plane.\nWINGFORD: Not... a plane?\nDOCTOR: No. It’s obviously an alien space craft.\nDOCTOR: TENSE PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: You look confused. Maybe you didn’t know. Well, did you or didn’t you?\nWINGFORD: (WITH SOME DIFFICULTY) It’s all a matter of National Security.\nDOCTOR: Now... that’s interesting. Some kind of perception barrier? Conditioning of some sort? Maybe you really don’t know what’s going on here.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 103\nCORNELIUS: He should be given full submersion.\nDOCTOR: Submersion like those poor, blue souls in the harbour? And why were they so blue? Is that how blue you are under your carefully applied make-up?\nWINGFORD: You will complete your calculations.\nDOCTOR: Well, I might. Or I might not. It depends.\nCORNELIUS: On what?\nDOCTOR: On where the pilot of your craft is. The alien pilot. Is it controlling you? Is that it?\nWINGFORD: (CONFUSED) I... I...\nDOCTOR: Giving you blue skin, controlling you, making some of you jump in the water? You tell me, I’ve given up guessing.\nWINGFORD: (SUDDENLY ‘UNEARTHLY’, WITH EFFORT) The humans here captured and tortured us, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oooh, now that’s not you talking, is it, Commander?\nWINGFORD: You are too intelligent for us to fool. (BEAT) We had to protect ourselves or they would have destroyed us or stranded us here forever.\nDOCTOR: So you bent them to your will.\nWINGFORD: We had reached the limit of raw materials and expertise here. We could no longer proceed with the repairs of our ship. So we accessed the humans’ security network. Accessed your files. Infiltrated UNIT. We discovered that you too were alien to this planet. You must know of the cruelty and destructiveness of this species.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 104\nDOCTOR: (A LITTLE FORLORN) I do. But—\nWINGFORD: Then you know we had no choice but to subdue them.\nDOCTOR: There’s always a choice.\nWINGFORD: We have not harmed them.\nDOCTOR: Except for the dead villagers in the harbour.\nWINGFORD: They are not dead. They were.. resting. Conserving.\nDOCTOR: Conserving what?\nWINGFORD: When we have no use for them, the cold of the water preserves them.\nDOCTOR: But they were dead. Why should I believe you?\nWINGFORD: All we want to do is leave this world. There is nothing for us here. We wish only to resume our voyage.\nDOCTOR: Tell me about this voyage of yours and I might believe you.\nDOCTOR: A TELEPHONE RINGS.\nDOCTOR: Expecting a call?\nDOCTOR: PHONE PICKED UP.\nWINGFORD: Thank you.\nWINGFORD: PUTS PHONE DOWN.\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 105\nDOCTOR: Good news?\nWINGFORD: Yes. Cornelius, the screen.\nCORNELIUS: Sir.\nCORNELIUS: A DESK SHUTTER IS PULLED BACK. WE HEAR THE HUM OF ALIEN TECHNOLOGY.\nDOCTOR: Ah, now that monitor screen definitely wasn’t manufactured on Earth.\nDOCTOR: STATIC OF SCREEN CLEARING/TUNING IN.\nDOCTOR: ON ‘DISTORT’, THE SOUNDS OF A SHIP APPROACHING ACROSS ROUGH SEE.\nDOCTOR: I see you have visitors. The police arriving early?\nCORNELIUS: Look closely, Doctor. Lashed to the deck of that ship.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS. Of course, that’s what that lorry was for at UNIT HQ. You’ve had the TARDIS brought here.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 106\nDOCTOR: JO AND HEDGERTON ARE CLIMBING DOWN THROUGH THE METAL INFRASTRUCTURE.\nDOCTOR: PUMPING SOUND OF THE PIPE.\nJO: (EFFORT OF CLIMBING) Down here? That’s the way the pipe is leading.\nHEDGERTON: Argh! (CONTINUES TO PANIC)\nJO: (GRABBING HIM) It’s all right. It’s all right, I’ve got you. That’s it. You’re all right.\nHEDGERTON: (CALMING) Thank you. Thank you.\nJO: You okay to go on?\nHEDGERTON: Yes.. yes. It’s just through here, then there’s a ladder down. It.. it isn’t far.\nJO: (SQUEEZING THROUGH A GAP) Beats me why we didn’t take the Lift;\nHEDGERTON: (EFFORT OF SQUEEZING THROUGH) They would have known we were coming...\nJO: (STOPPING) Who would?\nHEDGERTON: (SUDDENLY REALIZING) I.. still don’t know.\nJO: Do you think whoever it is has made you forget? Using that blue stuff?\nHEDGERTON: Perhaps... I don’t know. (BECOMING VAGUE) I don’t know...\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 107\nJO: Well, never mind, Hedgerton. For better or for worse, we’re going to get to the bottom of this, right?\nHEDGERTON: Er.. right. Yes.\nJO: Come on.\nJO: THEY START CLIMBING DOWN THE METAL LADDER.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 108\nJO: DOOR OPENS AND DOCTOR, WINGFORD AND CORNELIUS ENTER.\nDOCTOR: So what happens now?\nWINGFORD: Now you will complete the calculations for the power coupling alignment.\nDOCTOR: How can you be sure I’1l1 do it? I might not want to anymore, now I know that you’ve stolen my TARDIS.\nCORNELIUS: We haven’t stolen it. We’ve simply brought it to you.\nDOCTOR: Only because you think I’1l need it to restore your spaceship. I’m guessing you need a power source.\nWINGFORD: We have shown you courtesy and made you comfortable.\nDOCTOR: I can see how you tried. But you made a mess of it. The beer was off and the food barely edible. You might have poisoned us.\nWINGFORD: That... was not our intention. We are unfamiliar with human ways.\nDOCTOR: Even though you’ve been here since 1951?\nWINGFORD: (BEAT) You are also an alien stranded on this planet.\nDOCTOR: Not stranded any more. Why are you talking through these people? Why can’t you come out and show yourself to me?\nCORNELIUS: (IGNORING HIM) You must complete the calculations.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 109\nDOCTOR: Where’s Jo Grant? She obviously gave you the slip. And the Brigadier was never here, was he?\nWINGFORD: How do you know this?\nDOCTOR: I knew something was wrong the moment Captain Cornelius here supposedly recognised me at UNIT HQ. And when the Brigadier apparently recognised my voice... You see, I’m not the right Doctor.\nWINGFORD: But we know you are an alien. You must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m the Doctor all right.\nCORNELIUS: You are wasting time. Finish your calculations, then you\nCORNELIUS: will be taken to your... TARDIS craft.\nDOCTOR: Not until I know Jo Grant is safe.\nDOCTOR: PISTOL COCKS.\nCORNELIUS: You will complete your calculations, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (GRAVELY) Will I? Will I, indeed? (SUDDEN SHIFT) Well, perhaps I will. (HE GETS TO WORK)\nDOCTOR: SCRIBBLE OF PEN ON PAPER.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 110\nDOCTOR: THE AIR CONDITIONING SOUND IS DEEPER, MORE THREATENING HERE.\nDOCTOR: JO AND HEDGERTON CLIMB DOWN THE LAST FEW RUNGS ON THE LADDER.\nDOCTOR: THE FLOOR SOUNDS GRITTY AND UNPLEASANT.\nJO: (HUSHED) It’s so dark... Is this it?\nHEDGERTON: (HUSHED) Yes, I... think so.. Yes.\nHEDGERTON: THEY WALK SLOWLY FOR A WHILE.\nJO: (HUSHED) I can’t see a thing... can you? Hedgerton?\nHEDGERTON: (JUST A FEW, STIFLED, FRIGHTENED NOISES) TI...\nHEDGERTON: AS THEY CONTINUE WALKING, SLOWLY FADE UP THE SOUND OF THE PUMPING BLUE GUNGE PIPELINE.\nJO: (HUSHED) Listen... Can you hear it? It’s the sound of that pipeline full of blue stuff, isn’t it?\nJO: THEY WALK FURTHER AND THE SOUND GETS LOUDER.\nHEDGERTON: (HUSHED. TERRIFIED) There! Look! I can see it.\nJO: (HUSHED) Yes, that’s it. The pipeline. The blue’s glowing... (PEERING THROUGH THE GLOOM) It’s... it’s connected to something. What is it?\nJO: THEY MOVE CLOSER, AND WE CAN HEAR THE PUMPING OF THE GUNGE IN THE PIPELINE VERY CLOSE NOW. THERE’S A KIND OF ANIMALISTIC GURGLE ACCOMPANYING THE PUMPING NOW, ALONG WITH A KIND OF WHEEZING BREATH.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 111\nJO: (HUSHED) What is it? It’s.. moving in time with the pumping of that stuff. Maybe some kind of weird machine... Have you seen anything like this before?\nHEDGERTON: (HUSHED. CONFUSED, DISTURBED) I.. I.. Miss Grant. I don’t think this is... is a good idea.\nJO: (HUSHED. INSISTENT) Tell me, Hedgerton. Have you seen this before? Do you know what— ? (MOVES QUICKLY TOWARDS IT) It seems to be made of some sort of shiny, dark—\nHEDGERTON: Don’t touch it!\nJO: (YELPS IN SURPRISE) It moved!\nEUROPAN: THE SOUND OF THE EUROPAN CREATURE DISENGAGING FROM THE PIPE. THE PIPE SNAPS AND FLUID GUSHES OUT. THE CREATURE SCUTTLES.\nJO: It’s alive! The pipe was connected to something living!!!\nEUROPAN: (SHRIEKS) Get away!!!\nJO: What? It spoke!\nHEDGERTON: We must get out of here.\nHEDGERTON: MORE EUROPAN SCUTTLING SOUNDS FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STEREO FIELD.\nJO: More of them! What are they?\nEUROPAN LEADER: (SHRIEKS) Get away!\nEUROPAN LEADER: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 112\nHEDGERTON: Quickly, Miss Grant! We must get out of here! Back up the ladder! Come on!\nEUROPAN: Get away!\nJO: (STEELING HERSELF. BRAVE) Who are you? Where are you\nJO: from? Er... we mean you no harm!\nJO: EUROPAN/EUROPAN LEADER: Get awaaayyy!!! (SHRIEKING BECOMES CONTINUOUS )\nJO: HEDGERTON AND JO SHOUT OVER THE SHRIEKING.\nHEDGERTON: Come on, Miss Grant! Come on!\nJO: All right! All right! I’m coming!\nJO: SHRIEKING. FOOTSTEPS OF JO AND HEDGERTON DASH ACROSS TO THE LADDER AND START CLIMING.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 113\nJO: LATER.\nJO: JO AND HEDGERTON ARE CLIMBING, FRANTICALLY.\nJO: SHRIEKING (FROM PREVIOUS SCENE) IS ECHOING BEHIND THEM, RECEDING INTO THE BACKGROUND.\nHEDGERTON: Keep going! Keep going!\nJO: I’m right behind you!\nHEDGERTON: We’ve got to get to the surface! We’ve got to get away from here!\nJO: Are they following us? I can’t see!\nHEDGERTON: We’ve got to get to the surface!\nJO: All right, all right... but do you know what those things\nJO: were? Have you seen them before?\nHEDGERTON: Yes... I.. I don’t know. I think so... I’m not sure.\nJO: Hang on, Hedgerton. Hang on! I don’t think they’re coming\nJO: after us. Stop a minute. HE STOPS AND GETS OFF THE LADDER ONTO STONE FLOOR.\nHEDGERTON: This is it. Here we are...\nJO: What— ? Here? Hang on! Where?\nHEDGERTON: The way out. I found the way out... before.\nJO: But we can’t just leave!\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 114\nHEDGERTON: We have to!\nJO: But.. I can’t just leave the Doctor— If he is the Doctor— he must be the Doctor! Oh, I don’t know, but we can’t just leave him here!\nHEDGERTON: (AS HE RUNS OFF) None of that matters! We must go! Follow me! Quickly!\nJO: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Hedgerton! Come back! Come— (SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION. THEN RUNS AFTER HIM) All right! All right, I’m coming!\nJO: THEIR FOOTSTEPS ECHO DOWN A STONE TUNNEL.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 115\nJO: DURING THIS, WE HEAR THE STRANGE, DISTURBING CLICKING AND SHUFFLING OF THE CREATURES.\nEUROPAN LEADER: (ANGRY) You should have prevented the humans from escaping.\nEUROPAN: Yes! Yes, I know. But they are so.. repulsive. It is difficult even to look upon them.\nEUROPAN LEADER: Yes.. yes, they are truly disgusting. I had almost forgotten just how disgusting. The effects of the fluid should have prevented them from coming down here. They should have forgotten about us by now.\nEUROPAN: If those two remind the other humans that we exist, the final stages of the work could be disrupted.\nEUROPAN LEADER: We cannot allow that to happen!\nEUROPAN: I know, I know...\nEUROPAN LEADER: Then... You must follow them.\nEUROPAN: (WITH DREAD) Follow them... up there? Amongst the other humans?\nEURPOAN LEADER: It has to be done. They must be killed before they can spread panic. You understand that?\nEUROPAN: (BRAVELY) I... I understand.\nEUROPAN: Then go now, before it is too late. Fly.\nEUROPAN: I... will... go.. (A SOUND OF EFFORT AS HE BEGINS TO TAKE OFF)\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 116\nEUROPAN: THE SOUND OF ITS LARGE WINGS UNFURLING AND FLAPPING, THE FLAPPING INCREASING IN FREQUENCY TO A DEAFENING BUZZ.\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 117\nEUROPAN: THE SCRIBBLING OF THE DOCTOR’S PENCIL ON PAPER.\nDOCTOR: (MUMBLING TO HIMSELF AS HE’S FINISHING WRITING UP THE CALCULATION) And carry that forward... not forgetting the differential imbalance... which should give you... There! Finished.\nWINGFORD: (TAKING THE PAPER) Thank you, Doctor. (READING IT) Hmm...\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) You actually understand that? (THEN, REALIZING) Ah, of course... someone else is looking at it through your eyes.\nWINGFORD: These calculations solve the power coupling problem. You\nWINGFORD: have our sincere thanks.\nDOCTOR: (GRAVELY) I only hope I’ve done the right thing.\nDOCTOR: TELEPHONE RINGS. WINGFORD PICKS UP PHONE.\nWINGFORD: (ANSWERING) Wingford... (LISTENS) Understood.\nWINGFORD: PHONE DOWN.\nWINGFORD: Your TARDIS is ashore and on the quayside.\nCORNELIUS: It’ll be easier to take him to it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I don’t think the old girl will fit into your ‘water elevator’ dinghy.\nCORNELIUS: This way.\nDOCTOR: After you.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs\nCORNELIUS: (MORE INSISTENT) This way.\nDOCTOR: Charmed, I’m sure...\nDOCTOR: Page 118\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 119\nDOCTOR: JO AND HEDGERTON ARE BOTH EXHAUSTED FROM RUNNING. JO IS JUST CATCHING HIM UP.\nJO: (OUT OF BREATH) Hedgerton! Hedgerton! Just stop running, will you? For goodness sake!\nHEDGERTON: (STOPPING, EXHAUSTED) We... we must get away from them.\nJO: Don’t worry, they seemed to agree. But they weren’t attacking us.\nHEDGERTON: (RELIVING THE TRAUMA FROM THE 1950s) No... No, they didn’t attack. It was our fault.\nJO: (REALIZING) You’re not talking about what happened just now, are you?\nHEDGERTON: We... we did it to them.\nJO: Those aliens? You and the people here did something to them, when you found them, didn’t you? In the harbour... on that bright sunny day...\nHEDGERTON: Not straight away. We... we pulled the craft ashore. It was damaged. Scorched. We.. opened the hatch... And there they were. Terrifying... so.. so.. alien. Monsters. The villagers ran, screaming. Cornelius ordered his men to take aim. They... they shot one of them. The scream. The scream was... a terrible thing to hear.\nJO: But you didn’t kill them all.\nHEDGERTON: (DEFENSIVE) I didn’t do any of the killing!\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 120\nJO: All right, all right... But we saw at least two of them down there on Level Zero, so obviously they weren’t all killed. What happened to them?\nHEDGERTON: (DEFENSIVE) I didn’t conduct experiments on them. I’m an engineer. My job was to work on any new technology we found, not dissect the pilots.\nJO: Who ordered the dissection?\nHEDGERTON: Wingford, I think. Probably got orders from the government. I don’t know. They don’t share that sort of information with an engineer.\nJO: So.. aliens came here. You stole their ship and dissected them. But at some point.. the tables must have turned. They’re controlling you all now, with this blue stuff.\nJO: DISTANT BUZZ OF EUROPAN ECHOING DOWN THE CAVE.\nJO: That sounded like...\nHEDGERTON: I remember that sound. They fly! They’re coming after us. Come on, it’s just through here.\nJO: What’s through here?\nJO: SCUFFED FOOTSTEPS AS HE SQUEEZES THROUGH A NARROW GAP IN THE ROCKS.\nHEDGERTON: (SQUEEZING) It’s a short-cut. Come on, follow me.\nHEDGERTON: DISTANT BUZZ IS STARTING TO GET CLOSER.\nJO: Er.. all right, then. (EFFORT AS SHE STARTS TO SQUEEZE THROUGH) A short-cut to where?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 121\nJO: THEY SQUEEZE OUT OF A GAP INTO...\nHEDGERTON: Now just through here... (EFFORT AS HE OPENS A BIG, IRON DOOR )\nHEDGERTON: WATER-SEAL DOOR OPENS\nHEDGERTON: THE FAMILIAR, DRIPPING WATER SOUND OF THE WATER ELEVATOR CHAMBER.\nHEDGERTON: FOOTSTEPS AS JO AND HEDGERTON ENTER.\nJO: Your water elevator!\nHEDGERTON: There’s no one about. Quick, get into the dinghy. I’11l set the pumps going.\nHEDGERTON: DOOR SLAMS. HURRIED FOOTSTEPS OF JO ACROSS METAL WALKWAY, THEN CLAMBERING INTO THE DINGHY.\nHEDGERTON: SOUND OF LEVER BEING PULLED. WATER STARTS TO RUSH IN.\nJO: Quickly, Hedgerton! Before the whole place floods.\nHEDGERTON: (PANTING AS HE GETS INTO THE DINGY) That’s it. That’s it. We’re going up. They’1ll never get us now.\nHEDGERTON: WATER IN FULL, GUSHING FLOW.\nHEDGERTON: Shouldn’t take long. I set the pumps to maximum.\nJO: (A SIGH OF RELIEF. THEN...) Wait a minute, how are we going to warn the Doctor about— ?\nHEDGERTON: It’s too late. We must get away from those things.\nJO: Hedgerton, you’re just not thinking straight. I’ve got to find out what these aliens are up to. And if the man who\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 122\nJO: came here with me really is the Doctor, then he’s the only one who—\nJO: A SUDDEN SHRIEK AND SURGE OF WATER AS AN ALIEN SURFACES.\nEUROPAN: (SHRIEKING) You cannot escape! You must diiieee!\nEUROPAN: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 123\nEUROPAN: PART FOUR.\nEUROPAN: MUFFLED RUSH OF WATER.\nEUROPAN: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR, WINGFORD AND CORNELIUS APPROACH AND STOP.\nDOCTOR: Sounds busy in there.\nCORNELIUS: (SHOCKED) Someone is using the water elevator.\nWINGFORD: No movement orders have been given. Reverse the flow.\nCORNELIUS: Yes, sir.\nCORNELIUS: WRENCH OF LARGE LEVER. SQUEALING OF GEARS.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs\nCORNELIUS: WATER GUSHING. BUZZ OF EUROPAN. BOAT ROCKING.\nEUROPAN: (SHRIEKING) Die! Die! You will diiieee!\nJO: Argh! It’s trying to tip the boat over!\nHEDGERTON: Argh, no! It’s going to kill us!\nJO: Well obviously! Grab that oar— Oh, I’1l do it.\nJO: SHE BASHES THE EUROPAN)\nJO: IMPACT ON EUROPAN, IT SPLASHES INTO THE WATER.\nEUROPAN: Argh! Die! (GURGLING IN WATER)\nJO: Page 124\nJO: (EFFORT AS\nJO: Somehow I don’t think he’s going to give up! Hedgerton,\nJO: grab the other oar for goodness sake!\nJO: SUDDENLY, THE GUSHING OF THE WATER CHANGES TO A SUCTION\nJO: SOUND.\nJO: (NOTICING THE CHANGE) Wait a minute...\nEUROPAN: Nooo!\nHEDGERTON: The water... it’s... Someone’s reversed the elevator—\nJO: The water level’s going down! Quick, paddle for the\nJO: shore. (FRANTICALLY PADDLING) Come on!\nJO: That\nJO: thing’s getting sucked under. I only hope we don’t join\nJO: it!\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 125\nJO: FINAL, MUFFLED WHOOSH OF WATER.\nWINGFORD: That’s it. The water level’s back down now. Open the door, Cornelius.\nCORNELIUS: Sir.\nCORNELIUS: DOOR SCREECHES AND CLANGS OPEN.\nWINGFORD: Now, Doctor, if you’d care to—\nWINGFORD: A WHOOSH OF WATER AND A BUZZ OF THE EUROPAN’S WINGS AS IT RISES FROM THE WATER.\nDOCTOR: Well, you don’t see that every day, do you, Commander? Captain?\nDOCTOR: WINGFORD & CORNELIUS: (BLANK) I... I... Iu.\nDOCTOR: Clearly not. (TO THE EUROPAN) Hello there! Here you are at last! Are you the pilot?\nDOCTOR: EUROPAN BUZZES SETTLE AS IT LANDS. ITS MANY FEET CLATTER ACROSS THE METAL GRATING.\nDOCTOR: Swimming and flying... now walking. Very impressive. Clearly you’re a very adaptable species. Where are you from?\nDOCTOR: Now, we both know there’s no point in your threatening me. You need me. You brought me here!\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 126\nEUROPAN: I do not threaten you, Doctor. You look the same as the humans, so I find you... repulsive.\nDOCTOR: Charming. It takes all sorts to make a universe, you know. And there are some who might find you more than a little disturbing to look at.\nDOCTOR: Am I really that ugly?\nEUROPAN: Yes. (SHRIEK)\nDOCTOR: You know, I think you have a bad case of anthrophobia. A fear of humans.\nEUROPAN: It is instinctive. And it has proved well-founded.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean by that?\nEUROPAN: When our craft crashed in the ocean, these humans rescued us. But they feared us. Killed many of us. Experimented on us.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned they tortured you. I’m sorry to say that’s not surprising.\nEUROPAN: You support their actions?\nDOCTOR: No! But they did it out of fear and ignorance.\nEUROPAN: We had no choice but to subdue them.\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 127\nDOCTOR: So you said, through your human mouth-pieces. How did you do it?\nEUROPAN: A secretion we used back on our homeworld.\nDOCTOR: A secretion?\nEUROPAN: For controlling our food animals.\nDOCTOR: Your cattle? You treated the humans like cattle?\nEUROPAN: They treated us as subjects for experimentation. Our treatment of them was... kinder.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. So you turned them blue and kept them as young as they were in 1951.\nEUROPAN: I... do not... understand.\nDOCTOR: You must have noticed their skin colour changing.\nEUROPAN: Of course. But the year you spoke of... 1951?\nDOCTOR: The year you arrived!\nEUROPAN: Yes. We know. We have accessed much human knowledge.\nDOCTOR: But you halted their ageing. Didn’t you notice that?\nEUROPAN: We look upon the humans as little as possible. No matter what age they may be, they are disgusting to us.\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 128\nEUROPAN: JO AND HEDGERTON SCRAMBLE UP THE SIDE OF THE ELEVATOR BORE HOLE.\nEUROPAN: MUCH EFFORT AND STRUGGLING FROM BOTH OF THEM. DRAGGING SOUND OF HEDGERTON BEING DRAGGED ACROSS ROCK.\nJO: Hedgerton? Are you all right?\nHEDGERTON: I’m not sure. I feel... so weak.\nJO: Well, that was quite a climb. When that water just drained away, we had— Wait a minute... your face. Almost all the blue’s gone.\nJO: JO IS GETTING HER TRANCEIVER OUT.\nHEDGERTON: Has... ? Has it? Good. What are you doing?\nHEDGERTON: I’m going to try to call for help.\nHEDGERTON: TRANSCEIVER CLICKS ON. BURST OF STATIC, THEN...\nHEDGERTON: This is Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader, do you read me, over?\nHEDGERTON: HISS OF STATIC.\nHEDGERTON: (FRUSTATED) No reception down here. We’ve got to get out of this cave. Come on.\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 129\nHEDGERTON: SOUNDS OF GIANT MECHANICAL PARTS CLUNKING INTO PLACE RESOLUTELY.\nEUROPAN LEADER: You must proceed with the Doctor to the surface. The power coupling alignment has been successful.\nEUROPAN LEADER: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 130\nEUROPAN: I understand.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon. What do you understand? You were just going to tell me where you came from—\nEUROPAN: My leader has just informed me that your power coupling calculations were correct. The couplings are aligned. We are grateful.\nDOCTOR: Even though I’m repulsive?\nEUROPAN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: So now you need me to get energy from the TARDIS to initialize your power stacks?\nEUROPAN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Why should I help you?\nEUROPAN: We compelled you before with the threat of death. We will compel you again.\nDOCTOR: I was just playing for time. I’m made of sterner stuff.\nEUROPAN: (IGNORING HIM) We will proceed to the surface. Take him.\nWINGFORD: Yes... er.. Sir. Cornelius. Get the dinghy.\nCORNELIUS: Er... yes, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Ingenious, this fluid of yours... They can’t really see or hear you, can they?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 131\nEUROPAN: We have made these two prime units, with stronger control. But the strength of the secretion has been decreasing. As time has passed, we have been less and less able to produce it. Some of the workers are barely compliant. One has resisted and escaped, with your companion.\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED) Yes, Jo got away, didn’t she?\nEUROPAN: This is an island. There is nowhere for them to run.\nEUROPAN: PISTOL COCKED.\nCORNELIUS: Into the dinghy, please, Doctor. Move.\nDOCTOR: (BIDING HIS TIME) Very well.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 132\nDOCTOR: SEA CRASHING IN DISTANCE. SEAGULLS. A BREEZE BLOWING. FOOTSTEPS AS JO AND HEDGERTON STAGGER OUT OF CAVE.\nJO: Good to get some fresh air in our lungs.\nHEDGERTON: (EXHAUSTED) Yes... yes... It’s good... good to be alive.\nHEDGERTON: TRANSCEIVER CLICKS ON AGAIN. STATIC BURST.\nJO: This is Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader. Do you read me, over?\nJO: BURST OF STATIC. (TO HERSELF) Come on, Mike. (CLICK) This is Grey—\nJO: Hedgerton? You really are whacked, aren’t you?\nHEDGERTON: Yes.. sorry, I.. I’m so sorry...\nJO: It’s all right. Lean on me. That’s it.\nHEDGERTON: Thank you. Thank—\nJO: Hey, that blue on your skin has nearly completely faded.\nHEDGERTON: I remember it all now. Like it was yesterday. The killing of the aliens. The dissecting. The day they turned the tables on us. The dissection team defected first. They must have come into contact with the fluid when they... when they... they... (BECOMES INDISTINCT)\nHEDGERTON: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 133\nJO: When did all this happen, Hedgerton?\nHEDGERTON: Mmm? It feels like yesterday.\nJO: What year was it?\nHEDGERTON: Was it... ? It’s 1951.\nJO: And you were a young man?\nHEDGERTON: Were... ? I am.. No. (REALIZING) I’m old, aren’t I? Old... My hands! I feel.. My face feels.. I’m getting older, aren’t L?\nJO: Hedgerton. 1951... That’s nearly 30 years ago now.\nJO: STATIC BURST.\nYATES: (DISTORT) Greyhound Four.\nJO: It’s Mike!\nYATES: (DISTORT) This is Greyhound Leader. Do you read me, over?\nJO: (CLICK) This is Greyhound Four, reading you loud and clear.\nYATES: (DISTORT) Jo, what’s happening?\nJO: (TALKING FAST) Listen, Mike, there may not be much time. There are aliens here. They’ve been here for about thirty years, controlling the population and—\nYATES: (DISTORT) Thirty years... That’s interesting.\nYATES: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 134\nJO: What? What do you mean, ‘interesting’?\nYATES: (DISTORT) Because of what’s happened here.\nJO: What do you mean? What’s happened there?\nJO: WHOOSH OF WATER ELEVATOR IN THE BACKGROUND.\nJO: Wait a minute... what’s that sound?\nYATES: (DISTORT) What did you say?\nJO: Sssh! Hang on a sec, Mike!\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 135\nJO: WATER WHOOSHING, SWIRLING AND GURGLING.\nDOCTOR: Going up! Menswear, blue skin and amphibious aliens!\nDOCTOR: THE ‘ELEVATION’ PROCESS COMPLETES AND THE WATER SETTLES, LAPPING GENTLY. WE ARE IN THE CAVE NOW...\nDOCTOR: Do row us ashore, Captain. I don’t fancy a swim.\nWINGFORD: Do as he says, Cornelius.\nCORNELIUS: (RELUCTANT) Yes, sir.\nCORNELIUS: SOME ROWING, THEN THE DINGHY NUDGES THE SIDE OF THE HOLE.\nCORNELIUS: Get out of the boat, Doctor.\nCORNELIUS: FOOTSTEPS AS THE DOCTOR CLAMBERS OUT OF THE BOAT ONTO THE CAVE FLOOR.\nCORNELIUS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 136\nJO: That was your water elevator thing, wasn’t it?\nHEDGERTON: Those monsters must have somehow—\nYATES: (DISTORT) Jo? Jo, what’s happening?\nJO: Sorry, Mike, we may have aliens incoming.\nYATES: (DISTORT) We’re triangulating your position now, Jo. It sounds like you need help.\nJO: I.. well, I think we do, Mike. Yes.\nYATES: (DISTORT) Is it a full invasion force?\nJO: I’m not sure. Hedgerton? How many aliens are there?\nHEDGERTON: I don’t know. Some were killed, but the others went to the lower levels... They’ve controlled us all this time—\nYATES: (DISTORT) Sounds pretty bad. I’1l muster as big a force as I can.\nJO: (SHE’S NOT SURE) Okay, but we don’t really know how hostile—\nJO: THE SOUND OF THE EUROPAN SURFACING IN THE CAVE ECHOES OUT TOWARDS THEM.\nJO: (WORRIED, HUSHED) Sorry, Mike. Have to go. Something’s happening.\nYATES: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 137\nYATES: THE EUROPAN IS SURFACING, BUZZING NOISILY FROM THE WATER.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there you are again. Where did you learn to be so adaptable? You still haven’t told me where you’re from or where your voyage was supposed to take you.\nEUROPAN: What purpose would that information serve?\nEUROPAN: THE EUROPAN LANDS ON THE STONE CAVE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: I want to know who and why I’m allegedly going to help.\nEUROPAN: You will have no choice.\nDOCTOR: All you can threaten me with is death. But if I’m dead, you won’t get the help you need. And I won’t help you if I think you’re going to harm the human race.\nEUROPAN: You really are that concerned for this cruel, brutal race?\nDOCTOR: Everyone in the universe is capable of being cruel and brutal. What’s important is whether they can learn and change. And bit by bit, I’ve seen the human race start to do that. (BEAT) You might say, I have something of a soft spot for them.\nEUROPAN: Perhaps you might not be so tolerant if you had suffered as we did.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. (BEAT) So tell me... Who are you and where are you from?\nEUROPAN: We are the (AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE, SCREECHING NOISE).\nDOCTOR: That doesn’t translate very well, does it?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 138\nEUROPAN: Our infiltration of your government departments has provided us with much information. You know our planet as Europa, a moon of a world you call—\nDOCTOR: — Jupiter, yes. I thought there was no life on Europa.\nEUROPAN: There probably isn’t... now. We may be the last. When we left, our people were dying out... For aeons we adapted to survive the ever-worsening conditions of our world. But finally, the hostile environment overtook us.\nDOCTOR: It’s a harsh, unforgiving climate. You did well to survive as long as you did.\nEUROPAN: We do not need your sympathy. Just your help.\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute, I haven’t finished asking questions— Why did you come here?\nEUROPAN: A mistake. Our craft developed a fault. We were captured by Earth’s gravity well.. and crashed into the sea.\nDOCTOR: So where were you heading?\nEUROPAN: (FRUSTRATED) Enough questions!\nDOCTOR: Do you want my help or not?\nEUROPAN: (RELUCTANTLY) Very well... We were heading... Out there. Beyond this solar system. We hoped to find a planet to make our home.\nDOCTOR: Well, if you could adapt to survive on Europa all that time, you can survive almost anywhere, I’d guess.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 139\nEUROPAN: Except here. Surviving on Earth has left us exhausted. Producing the secretions to subdue these humans has reduced the chances for successful reproduction. If we stay here much longer, we will be barren. Our race will die out. That is why we will do anything to survive.\nDOCTOR: I understand.\nEUROPAN: Then you will help us?\nJO: (EMERGING) Doctor, how can you be sure they’re telling the truth?\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED TO SEE HER) Jo...\nEUROPAN: (SCREECHES) These are the humans I ascended to kill.\nJO: I know! And look what you’ve done to Hedgerton with that filthy blue stuff of yours!\nJO: HEDGERTON STUMBLES FORWARD.\nHEDGERTON: (A PITIFUL WHIMPER) It stopped me ageing, all those years ago, but now I’m free of it...\nHEDGERTON: EUROPAN BUZZES FORWARD.\nDOCTOR: Leave them alone!\nEUROPAN: There will be no need to kill them or any of these humans you care so much for... if—\nDOCTOR: (GRAVE) If I help you. Yes. I understand. All right. Take me to my TARDIS and I’1ll see what I can do.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS AS THEY START TO MOVE. THE EUROPAN STARTS TO BUZZ ALONG.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs\nJO: (SOTTO) Doctor, you can’t be sure truth.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I know, Jo. I know.\nDOCTOR: Page 140\nDOCTOR: they’re telling the\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 141\nDOCTOR: MASSED FOOTSTEPS OF TROOPS RUSHING OUT. IN THE DISTANCE, WE CAN HEAR HELICOPTERS LANDING.\nYATES: (ISSUING ORDERS) Right, keep in your sections! Into the helicopters as soon as they land. The pilots have the grid reference. Come on, look lively! (SOFTER) Corporal Winters, any news on those extra troops?\nWINTERS: Yes sir, Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart has telexed through the order from Geneva. They should be ready to embark in fifteen minutes.\nYATES: Sailing from Hull?\nWINTERS: Yes, sir. HMS Fortitude. At maximum speed, it’1ll take them up to four hours to reach you on Delphin Isle, I’m afraid.\nYATES: We shall just have to do our best to contain the threat until they arrive. Right, I’m off. (AS HE DASHES OFF) Wish me luck!\nWINTERS: Good luck, sir!\nWINTERS: AS HE DASHES OUT OF THE ROOM... CROSS-FADE TO HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF.\nWINTERS: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 142\nWINTERS: THE DOCTOR AND JO ARE SUPPORTING HEDGERTON AS THEY WALK ALONG — QUITE A STRUGGLE. WINGFORD AND CORNELIUS ARE FOLLOWING.\nWINTERS: THE EUROPAN IS BUZZING SOME WAY OFF OVERHEAD.\nCORNELIUS: Keep moving! Come on, move!\nJO: (EFFORT OF SUPPORTING HEDGERTON) Can’t you see Hedgerton is exhausted? We have to rest.\nWINGFORD: We cannot wait. You must keep moving.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT OF SUPPORTING HEDGERTON) It’s all right, Jo... we're nearly there. The TARDIS is just up ahead.\nHEDGERTON: (WEAK) I’m sorry... sorry to be such a nuisance.\nJO: It’s all right. Don’t you worry. (SOTTO) Doctor, he’s getting worse.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) The years are catching up with him. I know the feeling... (THEY’VE ARRIVED) Here we are.\nHEDGERTON: A.. police telephone box?\nJO: (SOTTO) Doctor, we could just get in the TARDIS and leave. I know. Bad idea, right?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I’ve been wondering what I’m doing here, Jo... somehow transplanted into the wrong part of my life. Maybe there’s something I’m supposed to do. Something I didn’t do before. Maybe this is a second chance.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 143\nJO: (SOTTO) Second chance? But if it’s in your own past, wouldn’t you remember it? Do you remember it?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No... that’s what’s worrying me.\nDOCTOR: EUROPAN DESCENDS NOISLY AND HOVERS OVERHEAD.\nEUROPAN: It is time for you to enter your TARDIS. Our ship is now ready for take-off. All it needs is the energy from your ship.\nEUROPAN: A STRANGE, HUMMING SOUND. THE TARDIS IS GLOWING.\nJO: Doctor, what’s happening to the TARDIS? It’s... sort of... glowing.\nEUROPAN: Our power stacks have locked onto it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but you won’t be able to take the power unless I release it. (BEAT) Well, am I right?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 144\nDOCTOR: CONTROLS OPERATED. NEGATIVE BLEEPS.\nEUROPAN LEADER: I am now on the command deck of our ship. It is as we suspected. We cannot simply take the power. The Doctor right.\nEUROPAN LEADER: is\nEUROPAN LEADER: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 145\nEUROPAN LEADER: TARDIS IS STILL HUMMING WITH POWER.\nEUROPAN: You must enter your craft.\nDOCTOR: But you were trying to take the power without my permission, weren’t you? Don’t you realise how much suffering could have been avoided if you’d simply asked politely in the first place?\nJO: Doctor, you can’t help these creatures. You don’t know what they might do with this power.\nDOCTOR: She’s right. Will you simply leave this island... this planet?\nEUROPAN: Yes!\nJO: That’s what you say!\nDOCTOR: How can I be sure of that? You could do a lot of damage with energy from the TARDIS. You could use it for a weapon to destroy the human race.\nEUROPAN: There is no time for this. Wingford, Cornelius! Restrain the female!\nEUROPAN: JO IS ROUGHLY GRABBED.\nJO: Get off me! Ugh— ! Doctor, don’t let them force you to—\nCORNELIUS: Shut up!\nEUROPAN: Kill her if the Doctor does not enter his craft\nEUROPAN: immediately.\nEUROPAN: GUN COCKS.\nEUROPAN: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 146\nHEDGERTON: (LAUNCHING HIMSELF FORWARD) No!\nWINGFORD: Get back, Hedgerton. (HITS HIM)\nWINGFORD: IMPACT.\nJO: No! Leave him alone. Hedgerton... ?\nDOCTOR: Can’t you see how weak he is? You could’ve killed him.\nEUROPAN: One human looks much like another to us.\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t talking to you! Commander! Captain! Listen to me, do you see what’s happening to this man?\nJO: He’s dying.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps he should have died years ago. Perhaps you’re all long dead...\nJO: Just kept alive by that blue stuff of yours.\nWINGFORD: (SOME DAWNING REALIZATION) What... ? What do you mean?\nCORNELIUS: (STRUGGLING TO RECALL) Blue... I remember... remember...\nHEDGERTON: (WEAKLY) The effect is weakening... even for them... Wingford? Cornelius? Don’t you remember what happened? All those years ago?\nWINGFORD: All... all those years... I... I...\nWINGFORD: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 147\nEUROPAN: Kill the girl! That is an order! From the government!\nWINGFORD: (STRUGGLING) All government orders must be—\nDOCTOR: Wingford! Cornelius! Look at that creature! Up there!\nDOCTOR: Look!\nJO: Since when did the government look like that!?!\nWINGFORD: (GASPING IN SHOCK) No! What— ? That thing!\nCORNELIUS: (HORRIFIED) What is that creature?!?\nDOCTOR: Quickly, everyone, into the TARDIS!\nJO: Come on! All of you!\nJO: HEDGERTON IS STRUGGLING TO HIS FEET.\nHEDGERTON: All of us? In there?\nDOCTOR: Come on, Jo, help me push them in!\nDOCTOR: JO, CORNELIUS, WINGFORD, DOCTOR, HEDGERTON:\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS SCUFF. TARDIS DOOR CREAKS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 148\nDOCTOR: DOOR OPENS/CLOSES AS THEY ALL ENTER. (NB. BACKGROUND AND CONTROL EFFECTS ARE PERTWEE TARDIS - REF THE THREE DOCTORS )\nCORNELIUS: What's... what’s going on? Where are we? (STARTING TO SOUND WEAKER) Where... ?\nWINGFORD: This is incredible... (STARTING TO SOUND WEAKER) Incredible...\nDOCTOR: Never mind all that! (HE’S AT THE CONTROLS) Now then...\nDOCTOR: VARIOUS BLEEPS OF DOCTOR OPERATING CONTROLS.\nHEDGERTON: Never mind... ? Have I gone mad?\nJO: So what are we going to do, Doctor? Are we going to leave?\nJO: A BLEEPING.\nDOCTOR: There’s a communication coming in through the scanner.\nDOCTOR: STATIC CLEARS ON SCANNER.\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) Doctor. Our fate is in your hands. Our ship is ready for take-off. All we need is the power from your craft.\nJO: Well you’re not going to get it— are they, Doctor? Doctor?\nJO: PAUSE.\nJO: And anyway, a taskforce from UNIT is on its way to stop you.\nDOCTOR: Jo?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 149\nJO: I managed to get through to Mike Yates. He should be on his way by now.\nDOCTOR: On his way? With a taskforce?\nJO: Well... yes.. He said he was going to muster as big a force as he could.\nDOCTOR: But why? What did you tell him?\nJO: Well... I don’t know. I thought.. I mean, they’re going to attack us, these things, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: (LAMENTING) Oh, Jo..\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) You think you know these humans so well, Doctor. You are an apologist for their fear and their brutality. Yet now you see how they intend to destroy us.\nJO: What about what you did to the people of this island!?!\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) We fought to survive in the face of their naked aggression. We were fighting for the survival of our race.\nJO: Survival?\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) We are the last of our people. Our planet will be dead by now. Our mission was to find another world.\nJO: Yes! You came to invade us!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so, Jo.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 150\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) Not this planet, with its corrosive atmosphere and its savage inhabitants. We hoped that our destiny would be out there... beyond this solar system.\nJO: So.. you don’t want to invade... or destroy us?\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) No.\nJO: Oh no... But if Mike arrives and attacks—\nDOCTOR: You’ve got to stop him, Jo. Do you still have your radio?\nJO: Yes... (FINDING IT IN HER POCKET) Yes, I have. (CLICK) Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader. Are you receiving me, over?\nJO: STRANGE LOUD STATIC.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 151\nJO: START ON EXTERIOR PERSPECTIVE AS FOUR OR FIVE HELICOPTERS WHOOSH TOWARDS US. CROSS-FADE QUICKLY TO INTERIOR.\nJO: THE STRANGE STATIC NOISE AND GARBLED REPEAT OF JO’S CALL.\nYATES: This is Greyhound Leader. We cannot read you. Jo? Jo, is that you? We’re nearly there! We’1ll be with you soon! Hold on! If you can hear me, hold on! Help’s on the way.\nYATES: CLICKS RADIO OFF.\nYATES: Right, sounds like they’re in trouble. Get the machine guns ready to fire.\nYATES: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 152\nYATES: CONTROLS ON THE TARDIS BEING OPERATED. STRANGE STATIC.\nJO: (FRUSTRATED) It’s no good— Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to try to give the Europans the power they need.\nJO: But if that ship takes off.. I mean, it’s buried underground, isn’t it? Won’t it smash through the island or something? Won’t that kill all those people who are— ?\nHEDGERTON: (VERY WEAK NOW) As the Doctor said... we should have all died years ago... And without that... that secretion, we’re all dying now. Perhaps we’re already dead. Dead and just still walking.\nJO: Maybe, maybe not. But we can’t condemn everyone on this island to die when that underground base gets destroyed. That’s—\nDOCTOR: Inhuman? You’re right, Jo. As inhuman as the treatment the humans gave their alien visitors 30 years ago.\nJO: So.. what are you saying? Two wrongs make a right? My Doctor would never have agreed with that.\nDOCTOR: I know he wouldn’t. But then, perhaps that’s why I’m here.\nJO: To wipe out the people of Delphin Isle?\nDOCTOR: Or to save the last survivors of an entire species. Or do you want me to let them die here in a hail of bullets from Mike Yates and his army?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 153\nJO: But if I can get through to Mike—\nDOCTOR: But can you get through to him? Can you?\nDOCTOR: CLICK.\nJO: Greyhound Four to Greyhound Leader. Come in.\nJO: STRANGE STATIC.\nDOCTOR: The power signal from the Europan ship is blocking the frequency. You’ll never get through.\nJO: Then... (TO THE EUROPAN) then shut off your stupid power Signal!\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) We cannot. The ignition sequence is primed and ready. Doctor, we must receive the power now. It is our only chance of survival.\nDOCTOR: Very well. I’m activating power feed from the TARDIS’s engines now.\nDOCTOR: HE FLIPS A SEQUENCE OF CONTROLS. A HUM OF POWER FROM THE CONSOLE BEGINS. IT STARTS RISING IN PITCH THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING.\nJO: No, Doctor! You mustn’t!\nHEDGERTON: (SO VERY WEAK NOW) Jo... Jo...\nJO: Hedgerton?\nHEDGERTON: Look... look at Wingford and Cornelius... Look at them.\nJO: Oh my God.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 154\nHEDGERTON: Both dead. Aged to death. They were older than me, you see. I was hardly more than a boy. Everyone on the island must have died years ago.\nJO: But you can’t be sure. You’re still alive.\nHEDGERTON: Not for much longer, I fear.\nHEDGERTON: But there may be others. Others who were as young as you.\nHEDGERTON: No, Jo. I don’t think so.\nJO: We can’t just assume that.\nHEDGERTON: The Doctor’s right. We did something terrible here... A race of aliens that meant us no harm.. And we made their lives into a living hell.\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) Power building. Stacks initiating. Primary engine drive engaging.\nDOCTOR: Steady... steady! You’re draining too much power too fast.\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) We cannot stop now. The primary drive thrusters need more power.\nEUROPAN LEADER: WARNING ALARM SOUNDS.\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nJO: Doctor? Something’s gone wrong, hasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I forgot... This version of the TARDIS pre-dates certain... modifications I made.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 155\nJO: What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It means the old girl won’t be able to regenerate her power fast enough. The Europan ship will take every last drop from her... She’1ll die.\nJO: The TARDIS will die?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nJO: You can’t let them do that. The TARDIS is too important to you. You just got it fixed again!\nDOCTOR: Is the TARDIS more important than the freedom and survival of a whole race?\nJO: What? No! You can’t think like that.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t know why I was here, in this wrong body, in this wrong era... But maybe I do now. Maybe it really is to correct something I didn’t get right before. If only I knew who was behind this... friend or foe— then I could be sure of what I should do.\nDOCTOR: THE TARDIS ROCKS AND STARTS TO GROAN. A CIRCUIT EXPLODES. A DEEP RUMBLE.\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) We are lifting off, Doctor! Thank you!\nDOCTOR: Good-bye! Good luck! (TO HIMSELF) And good-bye, old girl... This is as good a way for you to go as any...\nDOCTOR: THE POWER DRAINS RAISES TO A PAINFULLY HIGH LEVEL. CIRCUITS EXPLODE.\nJO: No, Doctor! No! My Doctor would never do this! You can’t! And what will happen to you?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 156\nDOCTOR: To me?\nJO: If the TARDIS dies now.. will there even be you? A seventh version of the Doctor? Won’t this change your history?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps... or put it on the right track. Maybe that’s why I’m here. To repair history. My own history.\nJO: This can’t be right, Doctor! You can’t destroy the TARDIS! I won’t let you!\nJO: FRANTIC FLICKING OF SWITCHES. BLEEPS OF CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR: Jo! Jo, what are you doing? Stop that! No!\nEUROPAN LEADER: (DISTORT) Power cut off! Engines stalling!\nDOCTOR: Jo, what have you done?!?\nDOCTOR: A HUGE EXPLOSION. CUT TO SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: HOLD. THEN SLOWLY FADE UP ON...\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 157\nDOCTOR: JUST THE QUIET HUM OF THE TARDIS.\nJO: (SLOWLY REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS. GROGGY) Doctor... ? Doctor... ? Where... ?\nHEDGERTON: (CLOSE) Jo!\nJO: (SHE WAKES WITH A START) Hedgerton? What’s going on? It’s all gone quiet. Doctor? He’s gone.\nHEDGERTON: He went outside?\nHEDGERTON: A DEEP, RUMBLING, CRUNCHING OF AN EARTHQUAKE OUTSIDE.\nJO: Oh no... (SHE GETS UP AND RUNS, OPENING THE DOOR) Doctor!\nJO: Doctor!!!\nJO: DOOR OPENG...\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 158\nJO: THE DRAMATIC SOUNDS OF THE ISLAND FALLING APART. BUILDINGS CRASHING TO THE GROUND. HILLS SUBSIDING. ROCKS CRASHING INTO THE SEA.\nJO: JO EXITS THE TARDIS.\nJO: The place is falling apart! Falling into the sea.\nDOCTOR: You were right about what would happen.\nJO: Then... they took off.. And destroyed the island.\nDOCTOR: No. You cut off the power. It created an engine imbalance and their ship exploded.\nJO: Oh. And I didn’t save the island.\nDOCTOR: I think the Europans had weakened its structure. Probably mining it for minerals on a molecular level. This place is as brittle as the crust of a salt lake. One shock to its core was all that was needed.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry about the.. what did you call them? Europans?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The last survivors from a moon of Jupiter. There was life on your doorstep all this time. And now they’ve been snuffed out.\nJO: And... It’s my fault. But I did it to save you. To save the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: You had the best of motives, Jo. I know that.\nJO: I’m not sure if that’s good enough. I kept trying to think what ‘my Doctor’ would have done.\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 159\nDOCTOR: I am your Doctor, Jo... just with the benefit of a few more centuries’ wisdom. But... (SIGHS) This was an impossible Situation. There was no right course of action. And don’t blame yourself. It was the fault of.. the worst of human behaviour. What happened here back in 1951.\nJO: So.. Do you think you’ll stay here, or will I get my own Doctor back? Don’t tell me... You don’t know.\nDOCTOR: I have no idea, Jo. But if things do go back to normal and the timelines reset.. I dare say you won’t even remember my being here.\nDOCTOR: BUZZ OF EUROPANS APPROACHING FAST.\nDOCTOR: EUROPAN LEADER & EUROPAN:\nJO: Look, Doctor! They survived!\nDOCTOR: They must have ejected or something.\nEUROPAN LEADER: You betrayed us, Doctor! Condemned us to death, just as your precious humans did!\nJO: No! It was my fault. You were going to destroy the Doctor’s TARDIS.. destroy his future! And any survivors on the island, I couldn’t let—\nEUROPAN: There are no human survivors! They have all died!\nEUROPAN LEADER: And we too will die. But you will die with us!\nDOCTOR: Jo, get back to the TARDIS! QUICKLY!!!\nDOCTOR: EUROPAN LEADER & EUROPAN:\nDOCTOR: A GUSHING, UNPLEASANT SQUIRT OF SECRETION.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 160\nDOCTOR: (ENGULFED) Aaargh!\nJO: Doctor!\nJO: HELCOPTER GUNSHIPS SUDDENLY SWOOP IN.

Doctor, are you— ?\nJO: YATES HAS BEEN RUNNING OVER DURING THIS.\nYATES: (ARRIVING, OUT OF BREATH) Jo! Jo... Is that the Doctor under that blue stuff? Is he— ?\nJO: I don’t know.\nJO: ANOTHER SQUELCH AS SHE BRUSHES MORE OFF HIM.\nYATES: What’s been going on here, exactly?\nJO: It’s... a bit of a long story, Mike. Thirty years in the making.\nYATES: Tell me about it... We discovered about thirty years of alien infiltration in that London secure location.\nJO: Really?\nYATES: Seems whatever had been going on here... they had spies or\nYATES: something right inside UNIT and the government for years. That’s how they were able to declare a security alert and get us all shipped out.\nPERTWEE DOCTOR: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 162\nJO: Doctor?\nPERTWEE DOCTOR: Jo?\nYATES: Seems as though the Doc’s going to be all right.\nYATES: ROCKS NEARBY CRASH INTO THE SEA.\nYATES: This island’s falling into the sea. We’d better get out of here soon. (SUDDENLY NOTICING SOMETHING) Hey, who’s that?\nYATES: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.\nHEDGERTON: Jo?\nJO: (DELIGHTED) Hedgerton. You’re still okay.\nHEDGERTON: It.. it would seem so. There’s life in the old dog yet, eh? Um... who’s that?\nYATES: Captain Mike Yates. UNIT. Pleased to meet you, Mr Hedgerton. You’re a survivor, I take it—\nHEDGERTON: No. Not you. That. Who’s that lying there in all that...\nHEDGERTON: mush?\nJO: What do you mean? It’s... the Doctor.\nHEDGERTON: But... he looks... different.\nJO: Does he? I hadn’t noticed. Are you sure?\nJO: Doctor Who: The Defectors by Nicholas Briggs Page 163\nHEDGERTON: (SUDDENLY UNSURE) Sure... ? I’m... No... No, I’m not sure at all now. I... Yes... that’s the Doctor. I.. I remember now.\nJO: There’s no mistaking the Doctor. Come on, Mike. Can you pick up the TARDIS with one of your helicopters?\nYATES: Would the Doctor ever forgive me if I didn’t?\nJO: (CHUCKLES) No... No, he wouldn’t. Come on.
