Well, we proved them wrong. It’s still not cheap, I know, but now we offer space flight for the price of a luxury cruise.\nJOANNE: (D) I realise that, of course, sir —\nCAMPBELL: But as of today, Miss Slade — Joanne — as of today, everything changes. Today marks not just the first flight of the Windermere, but the first day of Britain’s future in a post- carbon world!\nMISSION CONTROL: (OFF) Sorry, Mr Irons, sir, but we really should —\nCAMPBELL: We’ve got time.

Backwards or forwards?\nJOANNE: Backwards.\nDAVID: You hope.\nJOANNE: We’re hearing the original broadcast. The one Axos made when it first contacted Earth, back in the twentieth century.\nCRAIG: You’re sure?\nJOANNE: I’ve studied to that recording hundreds of times. (FX: VOICE OF\nAXOS: FADES OUT.) Trust me, it’s just a blast from the past. Axos is dormant.\nFUTURE JOANNE: (RADIO DISTORT) This is the spaceship Windermere. —\nDAVID: Hang on.

If Brewster here is from the Victorian age — what was he doing in 2011?\nBREWSTER: That was the Doctor’s doing. When I was his companion before, that’s where he dropped me off.\nDOCTOR: And I’m sorry it didn’t work out, but the fact remains, Thomas — it’s time you faced the music!\nEVELYN: I’m not sure I see the harm, in taking him back where he came from.\nBREWSTER: Yeah, me neither.\nDOCTOR: The harm is Thomas Brewster himself!

(BEAT) We’re approaching the threshold. Jo, you ready with that magic box of yours?\nJOANNE: Yeah, you just concentrate on steering, okay?\nDAVID: What is that thing, exactly?\nJOANNE: Recovered alien tech, as if you couldn’t tell by looking at it. There was stuff falling out of the sky like confetti in the last century. This was found in a field in Kent. So far as we can figure it out, given it didn’t come with a manual, it’s like a shield, displacing the flow of time about an area of space.\nDAVID: Not much of a time machine, then.\nJOANNE: No, but we figure it’1ll protect us from any physical damage as we cross the threshold, and enter the time loop itself.\nDAVID: Physical damage-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 15\nJOANNE: You know — us suddenly ageing to death, that sort of thing.\nDAVID: Yeah, but that’s not likely, is it-?\nJOANNE: Not to death, no. But the loop was first placed nearly fifty years ago, so —\nDAVID: What, we might turn eighty in an instant?\nJOANNE: Got to admit — I topped up my pension, just to be sure.\nCRAIG: Hold on to that happy thought, here comes the threshold in five. Four. Three. Two. [One. ]\nJOANNE: Activating — now.\nBODYSNATCHERS: MIXED WITH AN ANIMAL IN PAIN. HORRIBLE.\nDAVID: Turn it off! Turn it off!\nJOANNE: I can’t!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nEVELYN: Brewster, here? A menace? How?\nDOCTOR: Don’t let the ‘poor me’ face fool you, Evelyn. He’s already happily conversant with twenty-first century history and technology. If I take him back to the nineteenth century, trust me — he’ll use every scrap of foreknowledge he’s gleaned in his own self-interest!\nEVELYN: You don’t know that.\nBREWSTER: Aw, leave it, missus. He’s just sore about the damage to his Holy Joe reputation, what with me going round calling meself ‘The Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and that’s the second time you’ve pulled that particular\nDOCTOR: stunt, which rather proves my point — a leopard doesn’t change its [spots!]\nBREWSTER: What the Devil is that?\nEVELYN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUTTONS, LEVERS.) I don’t know!\nBREWSTER: Make it stop!\nBREWSTER: Hey, is it supposed to make that noise?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s not! —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB)\nDOCTOR: There, that’s better.\nBREWSTER: That sound — it was like a fox in a snare, screaming.\nEVELYN: It was horrible.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SCANNING NOISES.) It was a cry for help. Someone or something is in pain.\nEVELYN: Where’s it coming from?\nDOCTOR: The Time Vortex. Someone is playing around with time technology.\nEVELYN: Another Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: No.. I don’t think so. Whoever it is, they don’t have the faintest idea what it is they’re doing!\nDOCTOR: Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nCRAIG: It’s stopped.\nDAVID: What was that? Jo? Jo!\nJO: I don’t know, I don’t know what it was -\nCRAIG: I thought you were the expert on alien stuff.\nJO: It must... it must have been something to do with crossing the threshold. Some kind of temporal feedback.\nDAVID: Anything on the instruments?\nCRAIG: Nothing. Everything’s reading normal.\nJOANNE: And we've not aged fifty years, so that’s a bonus.\nDAVID: Not on the outside, maybe. My guts, on the other hand —\nCRAIG: Come on, people, we all need to focus. David — distance to target?\nDAVID: Two point six kilometres.\nCRAIG: Check retros. Coming about.\nDAVID: There it is again. Axos. You are sure it’s dead?\nJOANNE: 18\nJOANNE: We wouldn’t be here if it was dead. It’s hibernating, we think.\nJOANNE: But still, very much alive...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nEVELYN: So this time interference is causing someone or something to cry out in pain?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Let’s see exactly what. Scanner, please, Evelyn. —\nBREWSTER: It’s alright, I can do that.\nDOCTOR: Earth. Low orbit. Oh, now that looks familiar!\nEVELYN: What on Earth is it? Looks like a pitcher plant, floating in space.\nDOCTOR: Honestly, if you want something doing, don’t leave it to your former selves to sort out. I wonder what’s wrong?\nBREWSTER: Looks harmless enough.\nDOCTOR: Harmless? Harmless?!? That — is a parasitic organism, a vampire from space, drifting from planet to planet to suck their energy dry. It’s called Axos.\nEVELYN: Well, it doesn’t seem to be doing anything much right now.\nDOCTOR: What? No, do pay attention, Evelyn. It tried to feed on the Earth years ago, but I trapped it in a time loop. Trouble was, my TARDIS was, er, compromised, and half my memory was missing.\nEVELYN: So you bodged the job?\nDOCTOR: Well, it was all the Time Lords’ fault. They’d stranded me on Earth.\nBREWSTER: Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox\nDOCTOR: Why?!?\nEVELYN: Yes, Doctor. Why?\nDOCTOR: Oh, stupid reasons.\nEVELYN: Such as-?\nDOCTOR: Oh, mostly to do with stealing the TARDIS.\nBREWSTER: What — you stole the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Technically.\nBREWSTER: And he dares to have a pop at me?!?\nDOCTOR: None of this is relevant right now. Right now, suspect that someone or something is interfering with Axos — and it’s my business to put a stop to them!\nDOCTOR: Page 20\nDOCTOR: I strongly\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nDAVID: Axos straight ahead, one kilometre and closing.\nCRAIG: See anything, Jo?\nJOANNE: No. No sign of a hatch. So — David —\nDAVID: — we stick to the A plan. Fly into its mouth.\nJOANNE: Dock with its mouth.\nDAVID: There’s a difference-?\nCRAIG: Just take us in nice and easy. Fingers crossed we can get it to open up.\nDAVID: Jo, Craig — you know what comes next. Get down to the cargo bay.\nJOANNE: E.V.A. time.

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nSOUNDS: OVER SCANNER.\nBREWSTER: We’re inside this ‘Axos’, then?\nDOCTOR: In one of the minor arteries, by the look of it.\nEVELYN: What’s that flickering? — There!\nDOCTOR: Nerve endings, I expect. (FX: CONSOLE BLEEPS.) Ah.\nEVELYN: ‘Ah’?\nDOCTOR: Pressure — variable; atmosphere — very variable; oxygen — thin.\nBREWSTER: Which means, what-?\nEVELYN: Ohh no. You are not getting me in a spacesuit!\nDOCTOR: It’s either that, I’m afraid, or sit this one out in the TARDIS. There’s a good selection in the wardrobe room...\nEVELYN: What, of Barbarella’s cast-offs? (BEAT; THEN EXITS) Alright, alright — I’1l find something...\nDOCTOR: You’d better go and get suited up too, Thomas.\nBREWSTER: It’s alright, I don’t mind waiting in here.\nDOCTOR: Nice try, but I think not. No, I want you right where I can see you.\nBREWSTER: And afterwards, Doctor? You going to take me home?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 23\nDOCTOR: Give me one good reason why I should.\nBREWSTER: Because it’s where I belong. I’d stay out of trouble.\nDOCTOR: Somehow I doubt that. Selling off my TARDIS, bit by bit? Kidnapping innocent people? Running a criminal gang? Pretending to be me?!?\nBREWSTER: Trying to be like you, Doctor. (BEAT) I wouldn’t do anything — you know, to change the future and that. I’ve seen enough to know better. You do know that, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. Prove to me I can trust you, and... and, well, I might be persuaded to reconsider.\nBREWSTER: Deal?\nDOCTOR: Deal. Go on, if you’re going. Third door on the right. Mine’s the one with the fishbowl helmet.\nBREWSTER: Got you. (BEAT) Thanks, Doctor. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER) And while you’re about it, you’d better tell Evelyn — make sure you get suits for oxygen-breathers!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. CARGO HOLD OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nJOANNE: (STRUGGLING) Ohh, I hate these suits —\nCRAIG: Hold still while I check your seals.\nJOANNE: It’s not easy when you’re floating upside down.\nCRAIG: Actually — I’m upside down, you’re the right way up.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Thank you, Craig. Don’t want the lady losing her breakfast in a confined space, do we?\nJOANNE: Right. Harness on. Do people do that often? Get sick I mean?\nDAVID: (RADIO) Nine times out of ten, but we don’t mention it in the\nDAVID: brochure.\nCRAIG: Right, visors down. —\nDAVID: (RADIO) All good?\nDAVID: JOANNE/CRAIG: (FX: THROUGH SUIT MICS) Check./Check.\nDAVID: (RADIO) OK. Opening cargo bay doors. Hold tight.\nJOANNE: (FX: SUIT MIC) This is the bit I’ve been having the nightmare about...\nJOANNE: 24\nJOANNE: Ss\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. TARDIS WARDROBE ROOM\nEVELYN: Honestly, this wardrobe is utterly unfathomable. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be sorted by planet, date, colour or chest size.\nBREWSTER: (FX: PULLING SUIT OFF PEG) How’s this-?\nEVELYN: It’s got gills, Thomas.\nBREWSTER: Ah. Right. (FX: REPLACING SUIT) I’m sorry about the — you know, what happened.\nEVELYN: The attempted hijack, or abducting me to another planet?\nBREWSTER: Both.\nEVELYN: Yes. We got off on the wrong foot, rather.\nBREWSTER: Several wrong feet. (FX: ANOTHER SUIT OFF RACK.) Here. Try this one for size. Don’t know about the colour, but at least it’s only got two arms.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. CARGO HOLD OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nDAVID: (RADIO) Cargo hatch now fully open.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Roger. Hey, who’d have guessed, it’s a starry night out there. Jo? You OK?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Yes. My pen’s just gone into orbit.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) You trained for this in a water tank. Space is different.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) You can say that again. It’s so clear, it’s almost as if you could reach out and touch the stars...\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Extending umbilical now. Jo, keep looking at me! It’s my first E.V.A. too, don’t forget, so whatever you’re\nCRAIG: feeling, I’m feeling too. Just breath steady and don’t look down.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Which way is down?\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) I don’t know, but whichever way it is, don’t look there. OK. Here... we... go!\nCRAIG: THEY LAUNCH THEMSELVES INTO SPACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nEVELYN: So. How do I look? It was the best I could find in size Elephant.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be silly. It’s very...\nBREWSTER: . very?\nDOCTOR: . very you.\nEVELYN: Says Flash Gordon, in his go-faster stripes.\nBREWSTER: Who’s Flash Gordon?\nEVELYN: After your time, Buck Rogers.\nBREWSTER: What?\nDOCTOR: Right, then — helmets visors down —\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) .. and sealed. Ready?\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Yes, Flash.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Follow me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: AXOS — PASSAGEWAY\nLINKS: VERY 2001, INTERRUPTED BY NASA “BLEEP” EVERY TIME THEY\nSTOP: TALKING. AXOS IS VAST AND CAVERNOUS — THEY’RE LIKE\nPINOCCHIO: INSIDE THE WHALE.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) It’s alright, just tread carefully.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) Yeah, the ground ain’t too firm. Reminds me of me mudlarkin’ days.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Reminds me of a bouncy castle.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Come on — we should be able to trace the artery back to the heart of the ship. Quite literally.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) Hey, Doctor, slow down!\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) What is it about wandering around inside veins and arteries! Don’t do it for years, and suddenly you’re doing it two days in a row!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: EXT. SPACE (BESIDE AXOS)\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Right. I’m outside the Windermere. I can just touch the exterior surface of Axos. It’s soft, almost frictionless. I can’t get a purchase.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Give us a second. I’m reaching up to insert the\nJOANNE: relay line. Firing harpoon now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) What was that? Like an earthquake.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) I don’t know. Thomas, shine your light against the membranes here.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) It’s breathing. Is it breathing?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) If it helps to think of it like that, then yes. Axos is a composite creature. I think it’s dreaming.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) (SMALL SCREAM.) Ah! Something just — touched me!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Try to mind out of the tendrils. They’re sensors, like cilia.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) Silly what?\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Nose hairs? We’re up a nostril-?!?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn, are you sure you don’t want to go back to the TARDIS?\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) No! No, I think I’1l stay with you, if that’s alright.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) I wouldn’t mind going back...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: EXT. SPACE (BESIDE AXOS)\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Ugh. It’s bleeding.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) It’s organic, what did you expect? OK. Help me take the line back to the Windermere. Gently, yeah? We don’t want to tear the skin membrane.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) I know, I know. (TO SHIP) David? We’re making our way back to the cargo bay. We’1ll let you know when we can extend the docking tunnel.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Roger. No hurry. You be safe out there.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Jo? You OK?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) I was just thinking — she’s beautiful, isn’t she? Axos, I mean. Like a sea anemone, drifting on the solar wind... I know, I know, we don’t have time for [this—]\nJOANNE: CRAIG/ JOANNE: (SUIT MIC) (JERKED ABOUT ON END OF LINE) Whoa!/Oh!!!\nDAVID: (RADIO) Craig? Jo? You alright out there?\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) We’re fine. It — moved. Axos. Like a pulse, running right through the relay line.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Axos is taking in energy.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Energy? From where?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) From us, perhaps. It seems to have settled down now. Probably just an unconscious response...\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Love that ‘probably’.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Come on, Craig, time to unpack the docking tunnel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. AXOS — MAIN CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: FLOORS, SO CAST MAKING EFFORT TO INDICATE WALKING RATHER THAN FOOTSTEPS.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) .. and here we are. The central chamber. The heart of Axos.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) It’s enormous. Like a cathedral made of jelly.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) I thought we were in a spaceship.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) We are. The spaceship is Axos. A vast organism with a Single mind, but with the ability to extrude smaller independent units, so it can relate to other species.\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) Friendly, is it?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) No. It relates to them, and then it absorbs them. (FX: BLEEP FROM SUIT.) Aha! Pressure — one atmosphere; oxygen — well, that’1ll do.\nDOCTOR: (NORMAL — NO MIC) There, that’s better.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) We can take raise our visors?\nBREWSTER: (SUIT MIC) You sure?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. We might as well save our oxygen for when we need it.\nEVELYN: Oh. Smells like wet dogs. And feet. How odd. It’s like the rugby changing room after the boys beat Loughborough.\nDOCTOR: What were you doing in the rugby changing room?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 33\nEVELYN: Sightseeing, mainly.\nBREWSTER: Hey, is it just me, or is this place getting lighter?\nDOCTOR: Axos is an energy vampire. Even our footsteps are giving it life.\nEVELYN: In which case — what are we doing here?\nDOCTOR: Looking for whoever, or whatever, caused Axos to cry out.\nBREWSTER: Well, I don’t see no-one here.\nDOCTOR: We got here first, evidently. Which means...\nDOCTOR: EVELYN/BREWSTER: Whoa!!!/Steady!!!\nDOCTOR: . which means, whatever is affecting Axos is on the outside, and they’re trying to get in. (BEAT) Come on, we need to get back to the TARDIS.\nEVELYN: Well, make up your mind.\nDOCTOR: Basic physics, Evelyn. If someone’s trying to access Axos from the outside, they’1ll have to make a hole to get in.\nBREWSTER: So?\nDOCTOR: Outside is a vacuum, but this part of Axos, as we’ve discovered, has an atmosphere.\nBREWSTER: $0???\nEVELYN: So... if someone makes a big enough hole...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 34\nDOCTOR: Quite. Whatever’s inside Axos will be sucked out into space.\nBREWSTER: But... we’re inside Axos.\nBREWSTER: DOCTOR/EVELYN: Precisely!!!\nBREWSTER: Well, what are we waiting for-? (MOVES OFF)\nDOCTOR: Slowly, slowly! Remember — the faster we run, the more energy we give Axos!\nBREWSTER: (GRABBED BY TENDRIL) Aaaah!\nDOCTOR: Oh, what now-?\nBREWSTER: (EFFORT) One of them ‘sillier’ things. It’s got me by the ankle.\nDOCTOR: It’s just a reflex response, it doesn’t know we’re here. Try wriggling.\nDOCTOR: I said wriggle, not do the lambada.\nEVELYN: Well, now there’s a whole mass of them. Twitching away like attention-deficit spaghetti.\nDOCTOR: More to the point, they’re blocking the way back to the TARDIS. (BEAT) Evelyn, stay with Thomas.\nEVELYN: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 35\nDOCTOR: These smaller vents lead off towards the exterior of Axos. I’m going to try and stop whoever’s out there from cutting their way in.\nEVELYN: How?\nDOCTOR: (EXITING) Oh, I’1l think of something!\nBREWSTER: (CALLING AFTER) You can’t just leave us! Doctor! Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY/REPLICATION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: RUSHES PAST... AND STOPS SHORT.\nDOCTOR: . Oh no! Dead end! This biology is ridiculous! (BEAT) Hold on. Is that —\nDOCTOR: A membrane! Or a door, you might say. Oh well — nothing ventured...\nDOCTOR: And now I can’t see a thing. (AN IDEA) Running on the spot. (BEGINS RUNNING ON THE SPOT) That’s it, running on the spot! Come on, come on.. Yes, now I can see!\nDOCTOR: IN DUPLICATION OF BILL FILER IN ‘THE CLAWS OF AXOS’ EPISODE TWO.\nVOICE OF AXOS: (FROM ALL AROUND) We are Axos.\nDOCTOR: (PAINED) Where are you-? Please — go back to sleep. Get out of my head, and go back to sleep...\nVOICE OF AXOS: (FROM ALL AROUND) Sleep. Sleep.\nDOCTOR: (PAINED) That’s right, sleep. Sleep. I’m here to help. I know there’s something out there, something that caused you pain. Please — go back to sleep, and I can make whatever it is go away.\nVOICE OF AXOS: (SLEEPY, LOSING ENERGY) We... are... Axos.\nDOCTOR: That’s right. You are Axos. Now... sleep.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 37\nVOICE OF AXOS: (ALERT AGAIN) We are Axos. We... know you. You... are.. the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) Doctor? No. No!!!\nVOICE OF AXOS: We are Axos. You are the Doctor. We have slept. But now we wake.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) Please — you’re in my mind. Get out! Get out of my\nDOCTOR: mind!!!\nVOICE OF AXOS: We are Axos. We are Axos! We are Axos!!!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 38"

We are Axos!!!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22: INT. AXOS — REPLICATION CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: You will sleep, Doctor. Sleep, like Axos has slept. While you sleep, you will be replicated.

Craig, Jo — you’re good to go.\nJOANNE: (APPROACHING MOUTH OF AXOS) (SUIT MIC) Roger that, David. Access to Axos looks good. You can close the cargo bay doors now.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Check. Equalising pressure.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) OK, stage two. Craig — help me with the saw.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) You’re sure that cutting into Axos won’t wake it up?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Look at the size of it, Craig. We’ll only be making a minor incision, the equivalent of a pin-prick.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Hey, a pin-prick would wake me up.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) The mouth part’s healed over. I don’t see any other way in, do you? OK. You’ll have to help me brace myself. (BEAT) Don’t be shy, hold me tighter!\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Yes.

(HELPING BREWSTER UP) I daresay the Doctor had something to do with it.\nBREWSTER: Yeah, or maybe this Axos thing is just too figged to eat us.\nEVELYN: Who said anything about it eating us?\nBREWSTER: Yeah, well — can’t say I care much what it wants, I just don’t want to be inside it a minute longer. Come on, missus —\nEVELYN: ‘Evelyn’, please! —\nBREWSTER: Evelyn, yeah. Look, it’s time we made ourselves scarce. We should get back to the TARDIS, while we can.\nEVELYN: But what about the Doctor? We can’t just leave him.\nBREWSTER: He’s a big feller, he can look after himself.

Dunno where we are now. All these arteries look the same. Eeny, meeny, miney, mo, [catch a —]\nEVELYN: Stop right there, please! Now. There must be some kind of logic to the structure of this organism. (FX: THE CHAINSAW STARTS UP AGAIN, ABOUT TWENTY FEET AWAY.)

A motor?\nBREWSTER: Don’t ask me. — Hey, where’re you going?\nBREWSTER: AREA.

Not just a motor — a motorised saw, coming through the wall!\nBREWSTER: Yeah, I’ve seen enough. We need to get out of here!\nEVELYN: They’re cutting into it. It’s bleeding, do you see-? (CROSS) Oh, this is butchery! Sheer butchery!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 44\nBREWSTER: You’re not listening. Remember what the Doctor said, about the pressure? About us being sucked out into space-?\nEVELYN: Goodness, yes, you’re quite right. Please forgive me. Yes, back the way we came. —\nBREWSTER: Too late for that, they’re nearly through!

Can you see anything?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) It’s pretty gloomy.\nDAVID: (RADIO) How’s the pressure-?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Pressure? What pressure-?\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) (FOLLOWING) That was a joke. Pressure’s good, David. Gravity near Earth normal.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) (ADVANCING) OK, my eyes are beginning to adjust. The floor’s soft. Spongy, kind of like —\nEVELYN: (OFF) .. a bouncy castle?\nHUGE: ALARM FROM JO, CRAIG & DAVID SIMULTANEOUSLY:\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) There’s someone here! Craig, there’s someone here-!\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Jo, get back!!!\nDAVID: (RADIO) What was that? I heard — God, what was that-?\nEVELYN: Sorry about that. We come in peace, and so on and so forth. Brewster — say hello to our astronaut friends. Brewster. Brew— (REALISES, BREWSTER’S GONE) Oh, the rotten beggar, he’s gone and done a runner.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Craig, Jo — do you need assistance? Repeat, do you —\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) I don’t know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 47\nEVELYN: Yes, I can see this is all terribly confusing for you. I’m Evelyn — Dr Evelyn Smythe. Would you mind awfully helping me out of these tendrils? I seem to have got myself caught good and proper.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Careful, Jo-!\nJOANNE: Evelyn, you said. What are you doing here, Evelyn?\nEVELYN: I’m sorry-?\nJOANNE: I said, what are you doing here-?\nEVELYN: My dear, it’d be much easier on my ears if you just removed that silly helmet. Look at me, I’m not wearing one, and I’m absolutely fine!\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Jo, it could be an Axon.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) She could be, yes. But somehow —\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Jo! No!!!\nJOANNE: . I doubt it.\nEVELYN: There, isn’t that much better? I know, I know — “What am I\nEVELYN: doing here?” And I will tell you, I promise, just as soon as your friend stops waving his laser about.\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Taser.\nEVELYN: I’m sorry-?\nCRAIG: (SUIT MIC) Oh, this is stupid. —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 48\nCRAIG: Taser. High-intensity taser.\nEVELYN: There’s a difference, obviously. Well, if it means that much to you, point it where you like. Now — help me out of these tendrils and I’1l tell you how we got here — me, Brewster and the Doctor.\nEVELYN: JOANNE/CRAIG: The Doctor-?!?\nEVELYN: Well. He does get around, doesn’t he?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: We have journeyed far, and we have slept. But now we wake. Soon, when the Doctor gives us the secret of space-time travel, we shall be free of our prison, free to feed once more on the planet Earth. Free to feed anywhere within the whole of space- time. The feast of Axos is about to begin!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. AXOS — MAIN CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: (ENTERING, CALLING OUT) Hello? Doctor? It’s me, Thomas. There’s other people, here in Axos. Mrs Smythe — Evelyn, she needs you. Doctor!!! (BEAT; NO REPLY. TO SELF) No good. Oh, where’s he got to-? Brewster, old son — face it, he’s left you up a gum tree, good and proper. Ah, this is pointless. (ALOUD) Reckon I’11 just have to go back and do what I can for the old lady. (TURNING ASIDE, MOVING OFF; TO SELF) Yeah, but don’t blame me if the both of us end up getting ourselves killed, [alright?]\nCOMING: THROUGH WALL.\nBREWSTER: (TURNING BACK) Hang about, what was — [that?] (WALKING BACK IN; ALOUD, A BIT NERVOUS) Doctor? You there-? Don’t play silly beggars, I can’t see a bloomin’ thing in this [murk] —\nAXON DOCTOR: (OFF) Thomas. Thomas... Brewster.\nBREWSTER: That you? Doctor?\nAXON DOCTOR: (OFF) Greetings, Thomas Brewster.\nBREWSTER: Oh now, there you are! Scared me silly. What are you doing, hanging about back there?\nAXON DOCTOR: (OFF) What is it you want, Thomas Brewster?\nBREWSTER: I want to get off this thing. Get off here and get away. It’s not right. Crawling round in the belly of a whale like Jonah. Here, step into the light where I can see you.\nAXON DOCTOR: (STEPPING FORWARD) As you insist.\nBREWSTER: Mercy me! Your eyes. Doctor, what happened to your eyes? Yeah, and your clothes? You’re all golden!\nAXON DOCTOR: I am not the Doctor. I am Axos. And I bring you... a proposition.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 51\nBREWSTER: (TURNING TO LEAVE) You must be off your chump, I ain’t standing around waiting to be.. (HIS INSTINCTS KICK IN; TURNING BACK) Hang about. What sort of proposition?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY\nEVELYN: (AHEAD) Yes, this is it, this is where we went wrong!\nCRAIG: Jo, it’s getting lighter.\nJOANNE: I noticed. Axos is coming round.\nEVELYN: Ah! And there we have it!\nCRAIG: (TO JO) I don’t believe it. The old lady was telling the truth.\nJOANNE: (STEPPING FORWARD) A nineteen-fifties metropolitan police box. I’1l bet the doors open the wrong way, and it makes a noise like an elephant in labour. (SHAKING HEAD) Just like it says in the UNIT files. Incredible.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) It is, rather. But I’d keep my hands off, if I were you!\nEVELYN: Doctor! Where’ve you been-?\nDOCTOR: Ah, well — Axos attacked my mind. But when I came round, it seemed to have retreated back into dormancy — (BREAKS OFF)\nDOCTOR: Young woman, when I say ‘Hands off’ —\nJOANNE: Ow!\nDOCTOR: . I say it for a reason!\nEVELYN: There’s tendrils, all around the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 53\nDOCTOR: Yes. Axos is trying to get its claws into her. (ALOUD,\nADDRESSING: AXOS) But it won’t succeed!\nEVELYN: It can, however, succeed in keeping us stuck here for the duration.\nDOCTOR: That, I suspect, is the plan. — Where’s Brewster?\nEVELYN: Skedaddled, true to form. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Well, he’1ll find out soon enough, we’re all in the same multi- nucleic boat. So, then, Evelyn — aren’t you going to introduce us to your astronaut friends?\nEVELYN: Yes, of course. This is [Joanne —]\nJOANNE: . Joanne Slade.\nDOCTOR: And the chap with the taser?\nCRAIG: Craig Swanson.\nDOCTOR: Ironclad Industries spacesuits. A private mission, then. Surely not space tourism?!?\nCRAIG: We don’t like the ‘T’ word.\nDOCTOR: Whether you like it or not, Mr Swanson — I can scarcely believe you’ve broken into Axos, only to shepherd in a shuttleful of Sightseers! You do realise, I hope, the catastrophic consequences for Earth, should Axos break free of its temporal trap?\nJOANNE: The catastrophe’s on us already, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, what do you mean by [that-?]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 54\nEVELYN: Oh my goodness!\nDOCTOR: Stay calm! Axos doesn’t want us dead, else it’d just have opened its mouth and coughed us out.\nJOANNE: We need to proceed with stage three of the mission. Doctor — we've read the files, we know you’ve been inside Axos before.\nDOCTOR: Ye-es...\nJOANNE: So you can lead us on. Take us to the central chamber. Take us to the heart of Axos!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY/EYE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) So how d’you know my name, then? Did the Doctor tell you? The real Doctor, I mean?\nAXON DOCTOR: (WALKING) We have replicated the Doctor, so we might share his ideas, his knowledge, his memories. Some of those memories are of you, Thomas Brewster.\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) (WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM) Oh. That’s good.\nAXON DOCTOR: (WALKING) He does not trust you. We believe he is right not do to so. It is in your nature to betray him.\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) You know what they say — ‘Give a dog a bad name...’\nAXON DOCTOR: (STOPPING) Who are these ‘they’?\nBREWSTER: Don’t matter. So where is he, the Doctor? (A THOUGHT) You haven't... you know?\nAXON DOCTOR: You... know?\nBREWSTER: Topped him? Done him in? (BEAT) Killed him?\nAXON DOCTOR: The Doctor... lives. (WALKS)\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) Good, cos I ain’t doing nothing for you if the Doctor ain’t safe. Old lady Smythe, too, for that matter. Now, about this ‘proposition’ of yours...\nAXON DOCTOR: (WALKING) Humans have boarded Axos. But Axos has slept. We are not strong.\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) And-?\nAXON DOCTOR: (WALKING) You are deceitful, dangerous and sly, Thomas Brewster.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 56\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) Yeah, alright...!\nAXON DOCTOR: (STOPPING) We wish you to speak for Axos.\nBREWSTER: What-?\nAXON DOCTOR: We have arrived. You may enter the chamber adjoining.\nBREWSTER: (FX: PARTING ‘CURTAINS’, AS BEFORE.) If you sSay.. Oh my life! What is that... thing?\nAXON DOCTOR: Behold, Thomas Brewster - the eye of Axos!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nJOANNE: (RADIO) David? You there? Come in, David. —\nDAVID: (SPEAKING INTO COMMS) I’m here, Jo. What’s happening?\nJOANNE: (RADIO) You heard everything, right?\nDAVID: The mysterious Doctor, yeah. If he is the Doctor, the real Doctor, we should leave now. Abort.\nJOANNE: (RADIO) We can’t do that, David. We agreed with Campbell — we’d stick to the plan, no matter what. Voices, time travel, monsters, anything.\nDAVID: I know, but —\nJOANNE: (RADIO) Nothing stops the mission, David. Nothing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY\nEVELYN: She’s taking her time. The lovely Ms Slade.\nCRAIG: She’s got some gear to bring in. For the mission.\nEVELYN: And the mission is...? (BEAT) No answer. You don’t mind if we speculate among ourselves?\nCRAIG: Just don’t wander off.\nEVELYN: I wouldn’t dream of it, Mr Swanson. (BEAT; SOTTO) Whatever it is they’re up to, Doctor, they’re playing their cards very close to their chest.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) We need to watch these people like hawks. Our Thomas Brewster, too, when he gets back from wherever it is he’s wandered off to.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) I have a feeling he went in search of you. You never know, that young man might yet surprise us.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Oh, he’s full of surprises.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) I think he means well. Surely that’s all that matters.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Evelyn, have you forgotten, he tried to hi-jack the TARDIS!\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) Everybody makes mistakes. For heaven’s sake, we wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t managed to mess something up in the past!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Well now you’re being unfair.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) All I’m saying is that maybe Thomas has never had the opportunity to be trustworthy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 59\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I’m sorry?\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) Doctor, trust is a two-way street. How can he prove he can be trusted, if you’re not prepared to give him a chance? And, for that matter, if you’re not prepared to trust him, why should he trust you?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I suppose you may have a point.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) You two, your problem is that you’re more similar than you realise.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I hardly think —\nDOCTOR: EVELYN; (SOTTO) You’re both outsiders, forced to be self-sufficient, never fitting in anywhere — but both trying to do the right thing.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) There is that, yes.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) And both as pig-headed, too!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Consistency of character is a virtue.\nJOANNE: (APPROACHING FROM OFF, HUMPING GUITAR AMP-SIZED OBJECT) Give us a hand with this thing, Craig.\nCRAIG: Well, what about these two?\nJOANNE: I think you can afford to lower the taser, just for a minute. They’re not going anywhere, are they?\nDOCTOR: In which case — why don’t I help with that gadget of yours? It looks fascinating.\nJOANNE: What? The great Doctor? You don’t know what it is?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 60\nDOCTOR: It’s a Sell-Ska-Ratch Universal Arbitrator. Made by a race as far advanced from humans as you are from nematode worms. By the look of it, it’s been dropped from a great height, then rebuilt by an engineer working for Ironclad Industries, who’s painted it a cheerful shade of yellow and given it to you to play with. (BEAT) Yes, Ms Slade, I am ‘the great Doctor’. I’m here to help.\nJOANNE: I believe you. Now, please — lead the way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: So, the big scary Eye. This is, what, your brain or something?\nAXON DOCTOR: No. Axos is one.\nVOICE OF AXOS: We are Axos.\nAXON DOCTOR: We are all Axos.\nBREWSTER: One Eye, maybe, but you don’t seem short of voices. So why d’you need me to speak for you?\nVOICE OF AXOS: The human astronauts can hurt us. The Doctor can hurt us. But Axos is weak.\nAXON DOCTOR: We need time, Thomas Brewster. Time to gather our strength, so we may feed on the humans’ spacecraft, and commence our nutrition cycle.\nVOICE OF AXOS: Only then will we have the energy to break free of our space- time prison.\nAXON DOCTOR: The prison the Doctor placed us in.\nBREWSTER: I get you. You want me to hold things up a bit, so you can spring yourselves out of the jug?\nAXON DOCTOR: Hold... things... up. That is correct, Thomas Brewster.\nBREWSTER: Then — what, you’ll be gone?\nVOICE OF AXOS: (UNFAMILIAR WITH LYING) Then... we will be gone.\nBREWSTER: Fair dos. What do I get?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 62\nVOICE OF AXOS: We know you, Thomas Brewster. We know what it is you most\nVOICE OF AXOS: desire.\nBREWSTER: Oh yeah?\nAXON DOCTOR: There is a substance we call Axonite.\nVOICE OF AXOS: Axonite is the chameleon of the elements. It uses the energy it absorbs, not only to copy but to recreate and restructure any\nVOICE OF AXOS: given substance.\nBREWSTER: Like you copied the Doctor-?\nAXON DOCTOR: Our energy levels are too depleted at present to allow for the\nAXON DOCTOR: creation of a perfect replica.\nBREWSTER: ‘Any given substance’, you say? Like, I dunno, a gold\nBREWSTER: sovereign?\nAXON DOCTOR: He means, a numismatic token.\nVOICE OF AXOS: Axonite can be used to duplicate such a token. In unlimited\nVOICE OF AXOS: quantity.\nBREWSTER: Well now, sirs — that is a handsome offer. I most desire.\nAXON DOCTOR: We know, Thomas Brewster.\nBREWSTER: Oh, yeah? So what is it, then?\nVOICE OF AXOS: We hold the Doctor’s space-time ship.\nBREWSTER: Come on, I wasn’t born yesterday. You’1l be break out of chokey.\nBREWSTER: But that ain’t what\nBREWSTER: needing that to\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 63\nAXON DOCTOR: Axonite may be used to replicate a Time Lord. Why not his TARDIS?\nBREWSTER: You’re pulling my [leg.]\nVOICE OF AXOS: Alert. Alert. Human astronauts have penetrated the heart of\nVOICE OF AXOS: Axos.\nAXON DOCTOR: Opening thought window.\nTHREE: (THOUGHT EQUATIONS SEQUENCE).\nJOANNE: (ON MONITOR) [Hello. My] name is Joanne Slade. I represent the common good of humanity. I want to talk to Axos! [.. Can you\nJOANNE: hear me? I need to talk to Axos!]\nBREWSTER: I see ‘em. The Doctor and old lady Smythe, an’ all.\nAXON DOCTOR: Well, Thomas Brewster?\nVOICE OF AXOS: What is your decision?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT. AXOS — MAIN CHAMBER\nJOANNE: (CALLING OUT) Hello? Can you hear me? Axos?\nEVELYN: (ASIDE) What is it they’re up to, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Playing with fire. (WALKING OVER TO JOANNE) A Universal Arbitrator. Ms Slade, please tell me you’re not planning to negotiate with this vampire?\nJOANNE: I’m not negotiating anything.\nCRAIG: It’s Mr Irons will be doing the talking.\nEVELYN: I’m sorry-?\nJOANNE: Campbell Irons, CEO of Ironside Industries. The man who bankrolled this mission.\nDOCTOR: Never heard of him.\nCRAIG: He bought out the old British Rocket Group, thirty years ago. He runs his operations out of the former Space Defence Station at Devesham.\nDOCTOR: A pity to see such a noble heritage privatised.\nCRAIG: Mr Irons hopes to extend his sphere of influence far beyond the shores of Britain, or the Euro-zone.\nJOANNE: (WARNING) That’s enough, Craig. (ALOUD) Axos? Talk to us, Axos. We wish to make you an offer!\nVOICE OF AXOS: (ALL AROUND) Axos hears you, Joanne Slade.\nEVELYN: (ASIDE, BAFFLED) Well, where did that come from-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 65\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Everywhere. We’re inside Axos, remember?\nVOICE OF AXOS: We are Axos. We are all around. We wish to hear your offer. To that end, we have appointed one individual to negotiate on our behalf.\nJOANNE: One individual-? I’m sorry, Axos. Please elaborate. —\nDOCTOR: (GROANS) Oh, no...\nBREWSTER: Surprised, much, Doctor?\nVOICE OF AXOS: His name... is Thomas Brewster.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nJOANNE: (RADIO) David? Come in, please.\nDAVID: Receiving you, Jo. Are we good to go?\nJOANNE: (RADIO) Seems like it. Activate the displacement device. Low level, just enough to get the comms channel through.\nDAVID: Right, she’s warming up.\nJOANNE: (RADIO) Now get Campbell on. Jo out.\nDAVID: (INTO COMMS) This is spaceship Windermere calling Mission Control Devesham. Are you receiving me, Devesham?\nMISSION CONTROL: (RADIO) We hear you, David.\nDAVID: Tell Mr Irons — Axos is ready to talk.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. AXOS — MAIN CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: We detect a communication from Earth. But the time threshold remains intact.\nJOANNE: We’re passing information through, not a spacecraft.\nEVELYN: (ASIDE) What ‘information’ -?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) I think the boss wants a word. The mysterious Mr Campbell Irons.\nEVELYN: (ASIDE) Hello, where’s he off to-?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Sorry, who-?\nEVELYN: (ASIDE) Mr Swanson, sneaking off out the way we came. Do you think we ought to see what he’s up to?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) I need to be here, to keep an eye on Thomas Brewster. Evelyn, would you mind-?\nEVELYN: (ASIDE) Of course. Don’t worry, I shall be very discreet.\nBREWSTER: Is this going to take much longer?\nJOANNE: No, no, we’re running now. Watch the Arbitrator.\nSLIGHTLY: BROKEN UP BY STATIC THROUGHOUT, BUT STILL CLEAR.\nBREWSTER: What’s that? Looks like a ghost.\nJOANNE: (FX: BUTTONS ON ARBITRATOR) I’m just refining the image.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) [That’s] better. Are you receiving me, Axos?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 68\nBREWSTER: Who’s that?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) My name is Campbell Irons. You’re viewing a holographic image broadcast from Mission Control, Devesham. I have the honour of addressing Axos?\nVOICE OF AXOS: That is correct, Campbell Irons.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Then who’s that with you-?\nBREWSTER: I’m Thomas Brewster. I speak for Axos.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Oh, right. One of your avatars, I presume-?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly.\nVOICE OF AXOS: Continue, Campbell Irons.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Of course. I expect you’re wondering why I’ve gone to all this [trouble —]\nVOICE OF AXOS: Your planet’s supply of fossil fuel has been exhausted. You\nVOICE OF AXOS: face impending social and economic collapse. Wind, wave and\nVOICE OF AXOS: geothermal technology will not meet demand and, although you possess nuclear fission, concerns over security have stalled its development. All this was inevitable.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) The world faces catastrophe. I believe Axon energy can save it.\nDOCTOR: Mr Irons — you must know what happened last time. You can’t, surely, trust Axos?\nBREWSTER: Hush there, Doctor. (TO CAMPBELL) What are your terms?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 69\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) There is a prototype microwave transmitter aboard the spaceship Windermere. We will use it to beam energy directly to our receiver on Earth.\nAXON DOCTOR: And if we do not permit this?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Then I shall cause the miniature nuclear reactor that powers the Windermere to explode.\nJOANNE: What-?!?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) I’ve no doubt Axos can absorb the explosion. But since Axos is stuck in a time loop...\nDOCTOR: It’ll be stuck in a feeding frenzy, absorbing and reabsorbing the full force of a nuclear blast! Forever!\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Destroying you over and over again, effectively. Sorry, Joanne. No price too high, you knew that.\nJOANNE: You’ve no sense of shame, have you, Campbell?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Errr.. No.\nBREWSTER: Hang about. Axos will still need to feed, right-?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) We will allow you to top up your nutrition cycle once every ten years. Contained to a specfic geographical area, I should stress. Initially, I’m offering you a strip of Central Africa.\nDOCTOR: What-?!?\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Oh, it’ll be very well-managed. We can engineer a cover story to mask what’s really happening — war, disease, a natural disaster. No comebacks, no reprisals.\nDOCTOR: Mr Irons, this is monstrous!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB)\nJOANNE: (STAGGERED) This — this wasn’t the plan...\nBREWSTER: (ALOUD) Well then, Axos —\nBREWSTER: Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: (DISTORTED, VIA THOUGHT WINDOW) .. you’ve heard what Mr Irons has to say. What do you reckon?\nAXON DOCTOR: Tell the Earthman —\nVOICE OF AXOS: . we will consider his proposal.\nBREWSTER: (D) Right you are.\nAXON DOCTOR: We are Axos. We are hungry.\nVOICE OF AXOS: We shall send our roots deep into the Earth below. We shall absorb its every atom. We shall drink it dry.\nAXON DOCTOR: Then we will accept the Earthman’s offer?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Yes. And let the feast begin.\nVOICE OF AXOS: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 72"

And when I saw you were deep in an important conversation, I thought I’d best not disturb you.\nCRAIG: (SHIFTY) Yes. I had to check in with Mission Control.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 73\nEVELYN: In French?\nCRAIG: It’s a pilot thing. Always handy to have a second language.\nEVELYN: I can imagine. Except I always thought that English was the universal language of aviation. I thought Mexican pilots in Guadalajara spoke English, just like Russian pilots in Moscow or Spanish ones in Madrid. Don’t tell me that in this century French has become the — well, lingua franca?\nCRAIG: Know a lot of French, do you, Dr Smythe?\nEVELYN: Oh, you know — enough to order a glass of Bordeaux and a bed for the night.\nCRAIG: Well, then — translate this: Haut les mains!\nEVELYN: That’s easy, ‘Hands up!’ .. (FX: TASER CHARGING UP.) Oh!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: INT. AXOS — MAIN CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: So what was it Axos offered you, Thomas Brewster? A lifetime’s supply of mother’s ruin, and all the gold you can eat?\nBREWSTER: That’s my business, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s business has created this mess. (SNORTS) Clean, green, everlasting energy for all! Was that the dream, Ms Slade?\nJOANNE: That was the idea.\nDOCTOR: Only with this Campbell Irons fellow reaping the rewards. Humankind! You should be pooling your resources to solve your problems, not looking for get-rich-quick schemes. And you certainly shouldn’t be resorting to anything as dangerous as Axon energy. This is fool’s gold!\nBREWSTER: Yeah, well — you huff and puff as much as you like, Doctor. (FX: EXITING THROUGH CURTAINS) I’1ll be back soon as Axos has made its decision.\nDOCTOR: Good luck to you, Brewster. (CALLING AFTER HIM) Just remember this — if something seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is!\nJOANNE: He’s gone. Doctor — quickly. What do we do now?\nDOCTOR: Oh, now you expect me to clear up this mess-?\nJOANNE: You're the Doctor. You’re here to help, you said.\nDOCTOR: Touché. Well, it seems to me Axos is still too weak to attack in [force —]\nDAVID: (RADIO) Jo? Jo, are you there-?\nJOANNE: One moment, Doctor. —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 75\nDOCTOR: Can’t it wait-?\nJOANNE: What is it, David-?\nDAVID: (RADIO) I’ve got a proximity alarm. Another spaceship.\nJOANNE: That’s not possible. We’re well clear of all standard orbital paths.\nDAVID: (RADIO) Possible or not, it’s here!\nJOANNE: Then it’s a rogue signal, like the message from the past. —\nCRAIG: (ENTERING FROM OFF, WITH EVELYN AT TASER-POINT) It’s not a rogue Signal. It’s the Eurozone Space Agency shuttle “Jules Verne”.\nEVELYN: Please, Mr Swanson, there’s no need to push!\nDOCTOR: Evelyn? What’s going on-?\nDAVID: (RADIO) (INCREDULOUS) It is! It’s the “Jules Verne”! How —\nJOANNE: How did you know that, Craig-?\nCRAIG: Because I called them.\nJOANNE: What-?\nEVELYN: I heard him talking in French. Didn’t catch what, but he was awfully jumpy about it.\nJOANNE: I don’t understand.\nCRAIG: Oh, Jo. Don’t you see-? I never resigned my commission from the RAF.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 76\nJOANNE: You never what?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see, Ms Slade? Craig here is a spy!\nEVELYN: A British spy, what’s more. James Bond. How marvellous!\nCRAIG: If anyone’s going to exploit Axos, it’1ll be for the benefit of all mankind, not just Campbell Irons.\nDOCTOR: I can’t disagree with your global sentiments, Mr Swanson, but still — this is Axos we’re talking about!\nCRAIG: Jo, I need you set up the Arbitrator. David, I need you to open a channel to Devesham. I want a word with Campbell Irons!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: INT.

Thank you, Phillippe. Please confirm visuals.\nMISSION CONTROL: LeFEVRE: We have a confirmed sighting, repeat confirmed sighting of Axos artefact.\nMISSION CONTROL: Check. Any sign of the Windermere?\nNILSON: Affirmative, control.\nMISSION CONTROL: Status on Axos?\nMISSION CONTROL: LeFEVRE: It’s not moving.\nMISSION CONTROL: Check that. The shuttle Johannes Kepler will be with you in five hours. If you’re not out by then, they have the option to open fire.\nMISSION CONTROL: LeFEVRE : Then let’s make sure we’re out.

The alarms.\nJOANNE: It’s the other ship, disrupting the time threshold about Axos.\nDOCTOR: We have to get to the Windermere, while Axos is affected. While there’s still time.\nJOANNE: Why-?\nDOCTOR: In case you’ve forgotten — your boss had a Plan B, if things didn’t work out quite as he wanted?\nJOANNE: The nuclear reactor. Oh no.\nDOCTOR: We need to disable your ship, first and foremost. Come on.\nEVELYN: (TO CRAIG) You too, James Bond.\nCRAIG: No. My mission was to take control of this vessel. I’m standing\nCRAIG: my ground.\nDOCTOR: Don’t argue with him, he’s made his choice.

Repeat, Axos is made safe.\nNILSON: What is this?\nNILSON: LeFEVRE: I think we could be picking up transmissions being bounced back through the time threshold. From the future, perhaps.\nNILSON: Saying their mission is a success? That implies — our mission fails, Philippe.\nNILSON: LeFEVRE: It might mean a different outcome, it might [mean that we-]\nALTERNATIVE: TIME LeFEVRE:\nALTERNATIVE: (RADIO) This is shuttle Jules Verne! We are under attack! Fuel cells ruptured, we are instigating emergency evacuation!\nNILSON: That was your voice.\nNILSON: LeFEVRE : Yes.\nNILSON: From the future?\nNILSON: LeFEVRE : Oui. A possible future only. You OK?\nNILSON: No. But we keep going, see what happens.

(STOPPING, WARNING) Evelyn — tendril!\nEVELYN: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The more Axos wakes up, the more lively they’1ll get. At least we don’t have Axonoids after us. Yet.\nEVELYN: Axonoids?\nDOCTOR: Well, I don’t know what else to call them. Like walking compost heaps powered by mains electricity.\nJOANNE: Come on, you two! (RUNNING, INTO COMMS) Craig, we’re approaching the docking tunnel. Get ready to seal us in!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT.

MISSION CONTROL (DEVESHAM)\nCAMPBELL: What are you talking about-? [Craig-?]\nCRAIG: (RADIO) You heard me, Mr Irons. Consider yourself under arrest. All I have to do is give the signal, and — Oh my [God-]\nAXON: CHARGE, AS PER ‘CLAWS OF AXOS’.\nCAMPBELL: What signal-? Craig, I don’t understand. What’s going on-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: The human known as ‘Craig Swanson’ has been absorbed.\nBREWSTER: Well, what do you want to go and do that for?\nAXON DOCTOR: Page 83\nAXON DOCTOR: For.. nutrition. We must possess the spaceship Windermere, so\nAXON DOCTOR: the feeding cycle may begin.\nBREWSTER: So he was what? A pick-me-up?\nVOICE OF AXOS: We do not understand.\nBREWSTER: I mean, is it me next?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Not while you remain useful to us.\nBREWSTER: Well, that’s me told. —\nAXON DOCTOR: Hold him. He means to run.\nBREWSTER: Me, run? Never — (GRABBED BY TENDRILS) Gaah! Get these\nBREWSTER: ‘sillier’ things off me!\nAXON DOCTOR: The Doctor had such hopes for you, Thomas Brewster. But you\nAXON DOCTOR: disappointed him. He distrusts you. We distrust you, too.\nBREWSTER: Nice.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nDAVID: Welcome to the Windermere.\nJOANNE: Doctor, Evelyn — David Brock. David — Evelyn, and the great Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Pleased to meet you, Mr Brock. Do you know, Evelyn, I think I might join you. (SITS)\nJOANNE: David? You OK?\nDAVID: Do you want the bad news, or the bad news?\nEVELYN: You mean, it gets worse-?\nDAVID: I’ve checked the nuclear reactor. It’s booby-trapped. Break the seals and — boom.\nJOANNE: Doctor? That sounds like your department.\nDOCTOR: Well, if I still had my sonic screwdriver...\nJOANNE: You don’t?\nDOCTOR: It’s on my ‘to do’ list. Come to think of it, it has been for a rather long time...\nJOANNE: What else? David?\nDAVID: Craig’s dead. I heard it over the comms.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 85\nJOANNE: Exactly. He was a good man.\nDOCTOR: Well, of course he was, but that’s not the point. You have external cameras, Mr Brock?\nDAVID: Yeah, why?\nDOCTOR: Show me the hull of this ship.\nJOANNE: My God. What is that?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid Mr Swanson’s absorbtion will have given Axos something of a boost. Axos is wrapping its claws around the Windermere. There’s no way we can leave in this ship.\nJOANNE: Maybe if we gave it a blast, with the reverse thrusters —\nDOCTOR: You might as well give it an isotonic drink and a couple of glucose tablets. Oh, this is hopeless. Any minute now, they’11l be trying to get aboard.\nEVELYN: Well, what are our options?\nDOCTOR: We don’t have any options. But I do have a plan. I can’t see it being particularly popular, but I can see it working.\nJOANNE: What is it, then?\nDOCTOR: We abandon the Windermere, and evacuate everyone to the TARDIS.\nJOANNE: What?\nDOCTOR: Once inside the TARDIS, I can lock Axos into a more robust temporal orbit, and transport the wretched thing to a long-dead and very distant galaxy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox\nDAVID: Why not just kill it?\nDOCTOR: (005 — AB) Page 86\nDOCTOR: Yes. And why not find some spiders to pull the legs off as\nDOCTOR: well?\nDAVID: Sorry?\nDOCTOR: It’s a living being, Mr Brock. A sentient creature. Not a\nDOCTOR: particularly pleasant one,\nDOCTOR: I admit — one that’s taken the\nDOCTOR: concept of “parasite” to a whole new level, in fact — but that doesn’t give us the right to snuff it out because it happens to\nDOCTOR: be a nuisance.\nEVELYN: Doctor, you said this thing could devour the Earth. Bit more\nEVELYN: than a nuisance.\nDOCTOR: Evelyn, even in your time there happily have you for lunch, but nonetheless.\nDAVID: Your ship, the TARDIS, where is\nDOCTOR: Ah. This is the unpopular part. inside of Axos, not now Axos is the Windermere and make our way\nEVELYN: You mean spacewalk?\nJOANNE: We don’t actually call it that.\nDOCTOR: are creatures that would deserve your respect\nDOCTOR: it exactly?\nDOCTOR: We can’t get to it through the on the move. I suggest we leave around the outside of Axos.\nDOCTOR: E.V.A.\nDOCTOR: We can gain access to Axos by cutting a hole in the outer\nDOCTOR: membrane. From there we can get\nEVELYN: What about Thomas?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — when we cut a hole,\nDOCTOR: to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: the internal atmosphere will\nDOCTOR: vent through the aperture and he may be expelled into space.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page\nEVELYN: Well, that settles it then. We can’t risk it.\nJOANNE: It’s one person, Dr Smythe. Against everyone on the Earth below.\nEVELYN: But still a person! Doctor, surely you can’t be considering this? You’1ll kill Thomas! Doctor!!!\nEVELYN: 87\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: (HELD BY TENDRILS) So why is it I’m still alive, if you don’t trust me?\nVOICE OF AXOS: You are more useful to us as a hostage.\nAXON DOCTOR: A human shield.\nBREWSTER: Yeah, but you could just copy me, like you did the Doctor.\nAXON DOCTOR: We are still weak. A perfect replication of your form would use up valuable energy.\nBREWSTER: True. I just wish I shared your conviction that the Doctor gives a fig for me.\nVOICE OF AXOS: We have assimilated Craig Swanson’s communications device. The humans are unaware of it, but we may easily learn their intentions.\nPREVIOUS: SCENE, DISTORTED.\nJOANNE: [It’s] one person, Dr Smythe. Against everyone on the Earth below.\nEVELYN: But still a person! Doctor, surely you can’t be considering this? You’ll kill Thomas!

FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nEVELYN: You’d really do it? You’d let Thomas Brewster die?\nDOCTOR: No, of course not. We have to find some way of getting into Axos without Thomas being sucked outside when the pressure drops.\nEVELYN: And what if you can’t-?\nDOCTOR: If there was any other way, don’t you think I’d take it? Evelyn, I promise you I will do everything I can. If we don’t act now, then in a matter of hours not only will we be dead, but most assuredly will Thomas be too. This is not just our only chance. It’s his only chance, too. Are you with me?\nEVELYN: When all this is over, you forgive Thomas, and you take him home.\nDOCTOR: Agreed.\nEVELYN: Then I’m with you.\nDOCTOR: Right, then — our E.V.A. awaits.\nEVELYN: (SARCASTIC) Marvellous.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER EVELYN’S VOICE PLAYING FROM PREVIOUS SCENE.\nEVELYN: You’d really do it? You’d let Thomas Brewster die?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Cease transmission.\nAXON DOCTOR: You were correct, Thomas Brewster. The Doctor does not... ‘give a fig’ for you.\nBREWSTER: Seems like it. Seems like I’ve just talked myself out of living, too.\nVOICE OF AXOS: No. Release the tendrils.\nBREWSTER: I’m free? You ain’t gonna absorb me-?\nAXON DOCTOR: We could not trust you before, Thomas Brewster. We did not believe that, when the time came, you were sure to betray the Doctor.\nBREWSTER: Maybe. But now I’ve heard what he really thinks of me, now you can trust me — is that what you think-?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Yes.\nBREWSTER: Well, you’ve got that right.\nAXON DOCTOR: You have made a wise decision, Thomas Brewster.\nBREWSTER: Axos, you’re a gent. (BEAT) So — what’s the plan?\nVOICE OF AXOS: We must take the spaceship Windermere. But to do so —\nAXON DOCTOR: We need more Axon units. Axon units — assemble.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: AS IN FIRST MOMENTS OF ‘CLAWS OF AXOS’ EPISODE 1.\nBREWSTER: What are those things? They’re disgusting.\nAXON DOCTOR: They are Axon. Our natural form.\nBREWSTER: Blimey.

Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Axos is trying to breach the hull of the Windermere.\nJOANNE: David, is the docking tunnel secure?\nDAVID: Not for much longer, by the sounds of it.\nDOCTOR: Right then, everyone — helmet visors down.\nHERE: ON.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Is everyone secured?\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Check.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Oh, er — ‘Check’.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) I’m quite capable of securing a helmet visor, Ms Slade.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) I’1ll take that as ‘Check’. David — open the cargo bay doors.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Roger.\nDAVID: ABOVE.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) ‘Roger’. Please, spare me any more of this jargon!\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) What now? Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 93\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Take the line. I’1ll be tethered at the far end. Evelyn, you next, then Jo. Mr Brock, you’re last. Whatever you do, don’t disconnect yourself from the Windermere until we’re attached to the surface of Axos. (BEAT) Mr Brock?\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) I’d roger that, but I thought you wanted to be spared the jargon?\nDAVID: THROUGH THE DOCKING TUNNEL.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) The docking tunnel! Doctor, the tendrils are breaking through!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Hold my hand, Evelyn, here we go.

Joanne, wait until we’re on the surface of Axos, then kick off and follow.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Roger that.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) This is madness. I’m walking, in space! Wheeee-!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Yes. Axos surface coming up now, Evelyn, rather sooner than I’d hoped. Try to find something to grab onto, a break in the skin.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Oh, just look at the Earth. It’s so beautiful. So blue. And white. Like marbled paper. There! I can see Africa!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Focus, Evelyn. Get ready for impact...\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) (WINDED) Ooof!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Quick, find something to hold onto, before we drift away again.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) I’m trying, it’s like trying to grab hold of an omelette...\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Here, some tissue scarred by meteorite impacts. Now, Evelyn, pull yourself along the surface towards me.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Hard to do anything in these gloves, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 95\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Jo? We’re ready when you are.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Coming over now.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) We need to make our way round to the far side of Axos. Try not to spend too much time Earthgazing.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) I’m sorry. It’s just — I should be marking students’ essays, not floating above the world like that chap in the David Bowie song. Why haven’t we done this before, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Do you know, I’m not actually what you’d call a fan.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Of David Bowie?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) No. Of space walking.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Made it!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Now keep going! Remember Newton’s third Law — if you try to move anything you’ll only end up moving yourselves.

Knew you’d see sense!\nVOICE OF AXOS: We accept your offer of life and energy. We have taken possession of your microwave transmitter. The means by which you intend to beam Axon energy to Earth.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Well, there we are then. I’ve got some champagne on ice, maybe you’d care to join me in a toast?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Using Axonite, we have modified your transmitter. We have... improved it.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Even better. So then — (FX: POPS\nCHAMPAGNE: CORK) To a new era of energy! And, of course, the start of a long and fruitful partnership.\nVOICE OF AXOS: Now, we shall operate the device.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) Whoa there, Axos — we’re not ready!\nVOICE OF AXOS: You do not need to be.\nCAMPBELL: (HOLOGRAPHIC; DISTORT) I’m sorry-?\nVOICE OF AXOS: Axonite is the chameleon of the elements.

Like a blow hole. A pore in the skin.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Exactly, Mr Brock.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) And that’s how we’re getting in?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Hopefully. Joanne, can you come about with that taser-?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Here you are. Whoa, upside down again. Each time that happens, I get a little reminder of what I had for breakfast.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Don’t think about it, just target the taser at the blow-hole. I’m hoping if we shock it, we might cause the muscle to go into spasm. All set?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) All set.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Go.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Well.

Two are standard B.S.P. design, but the other two I don’t recognise.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 104\nNILSON: Switching to broad scan emergency frequency. See if we can get them to talk to us —\nDOCTOR: (RADIO) Well about time. We’ve been sitting around here wondering when you were going to say hello.\nNILSON: This is the Eurozone Space Agency shuttle Jules Verne. Please identify yourselves.\nDOCTOR: (RADIO) I’m the Doctor, this is my friend Evelyn Smythe.\nEVELYN: (RADIO) Hello.\nDOCTOR: (RADIO) And as you can probably see, there are two British astronauts stuck here with us. Don’t suppose there’s any chance of a lift, [-— is there?]\nDOCTOR: LeFEVRE:\nDOCTOR: Pardon, but I am losing your signal. Please repeat, over? Shuttle Jules Verne to spationaut Doctor on surface of Axos,\nDOCTOR: respond please.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: EXT. SPACE — SURFACE OF AXOS\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Radio’s gone dead. That’s odd.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) I can hear you fine.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Me too. Maybe the problem’s at their end?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) There they are. They’re still coming towards us. Try waving. “Hello!”\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Look, their cargo bay’s open. What are they doing?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) I rather think they intend to get us inside.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Yeah, they’re extending the cargo arm now. Here it comes.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Mister Brock, can you see anything to attach yourself onto?\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Looks like foot restraints on the end there. I’ve used one before.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Right. We should probably carefully unclip ourselves, grab onto it and have a word with them once we’re inside their ship. I’m sure they’re very pleasant people, willing to listen to reasoned argument.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Doctor, our mission here is a legitimate claim on Axon resources.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Alright, Jo.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 106\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Just leave it.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) They can’t stop us. This is free enterprise, it’s a human right.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) But what if they don’t see it that way? What do we do then? Fight?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) David’s right. Your best bet right now is to co- operate. Now, whatever happens, keep yourselves hooked onto the line until we’re ready. We don’t want anyone floating off. Ready, Evelyn?\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Oh dear what?\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) I unhooked myself when you said we were going over. Just then. I thought it was an instruction.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Well — hook yourself back onto Axos again, quickly.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Trouble is... (EFFORT) .. I can’t quite reach it.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Here let me.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) It’s silly, it’s only a couple of inches away. Maybe if turn this way -\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) No! Whatever you do, stay perfectly still!\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn, stop! Stop, please.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) But I’m only a couple of inches away from the line, (EFFORT) I’m sure I can... (BEAT) Oh. It’s more like six inches now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 107\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn, don’t move. Whatever happens, don’t move a muscle. Remember, Newton’s third law!\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) But it’s no more than a foot away. Surely you can just jump and get me?\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Hold the line, Jo. I’m going to push off and grab her. Ready? Here we go.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Oh! Missed you!\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) It’s too late. We’ve lost her.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) What are you talking about, I’m still here. Not two feet away from you.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Here. I’m unhooking too. Daisy chain. Jo, stay attached to Axos. You hold David, I’1l hold him. You ready?\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Doctor, she’s too far out. The safety line is already stretched as far as it’1ll go. You’1l never reach her.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Well of course I will.\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Unhooking myself from the safety line and... detaching my oxygen supply. I can use it to propel myself. Push equals shove!\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) And then what? You’1ll both go floating off together.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) In which case, get the Jules Verne over there to pick us up.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 108\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) It’s not ‘over there’ any more.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) What-? Well, where’s it gone?\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Doesn’t matter now. I have to save Evelyn!\nJOANNE: (SUIT MIC) Even if you reach her, Doctor, it’d be suicide.\nJOANNE: By the time the Jules Verne comes round again, you’1ll already be miles away, in a new orbit. You’1l qualify as a couple of extra moons.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) I can hear, you know!\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Never mind them, Evelyn. Concentrate on me. Concentrate on my voice.\nDOCTOR: RANGE.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) How far away from you all am I now? Twenty feet? Thirty? I can’t seem to judge the distance any more.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn. Please, stay very still, any additional motion might cause you to accelerate. I’1l be with you as soon as I can.\nDAVID: (SUIT MIC) Doctor. You have to let her go.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Don’t be ridiculous.\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) They’re right, Doctor. It’s too late for me now. You look after yourselves.\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn, I’1l find you, do you hear me? I’1l1 find you, and I’1l bring you back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 109\nEVELYN: (SUIT MIC) Don’t worry, Doctor. It’s not your fault. Silly,\nEVELYN: idiotic woman, messing around in space like Barbarella. At my age. Goodbye, Doctor. My dear, dear [Doctor —]\nDOCTOR: (SUIT MIC) Evelyn. Evelyn!!!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 110"

It must have realised I was worth far more to it than mere nutrition, and made a copy of me. The drain on its resources would have been huge.\nJOANNE: Huge? Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 117\nDOCTOR: No offence, but my mind and physiology are so far beyond a human’s, it’s like comparing a parsley pig to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.\nDAVID: You’re too modest.\nDOCTOR: Somewhere on this vessel is an Axon construct, with my memories, my knowledge, my abilities.

We know the history Axos. It was not hard to work out.\nEVELYN: I must say — this makes a change from having to convince that I’m not a spy, or a saboteur!\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE:\nEVELYN: Non. You are an ordinary woman with no special training, qualification for space warfare - and who exists outside international law.\nNILSON: Page 120\nNILSON: of\nNILSON: people\nNILSON: no of\nNILSON: Whereas we represent untold trillions of Euromarks of Eurozone investment and training, backed up by the combined armed forces\nNILSON: of the governments of twenty-five countries.\nNILSON: LeFEVRE : And as such we are entirely at your disposal, Madame.\nNILSON: Where would you like us to start?\nEVELYN: I say.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: Alert. Alert. Spaceship Jules Verne now in range of microwave receiver.\nAXON DOCTOR: Then we must feed. Thomas Brewster, you will communicate with this vessel.\nBREWSTER: Look, I don’t want no-one hurt —\nAXON DOCTOR: If Axos cannot feed on the Jules Verne —\nVOICE OF AXOS: . Axos shall feed on you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP JULES VERNE\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) Axos calling spaceship Jules Verne. Over.\nEVELYN: What was that-?\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE:\nEVELYN: Quiet, please. (RADIO) This is Eurozone Space Agency shuttle Jules Verne, operating under the authority of the Eurozone Space agency. Please state your identity. Over.\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) This is astronaut Thomas Brewster calling. I’m on Axos. We thought it was alive, but it’s not. Fact is, it’s as dead as a doornail. We’re stuck here.\nBREWSTER: LeFEVRE: What is the status of your ship?\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) Yeah, the ship. The — um — the engine’s blown a gasket.\nBREWSTER: LeFEVRE: You’re sure Axos is dormant? Repeat, is Axos in a dormant state?\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) Dead as a five day floater in the Thames.\nBREWSTER: LeFEVRE : Repeat that please?\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) It’s dead, yes. You can dock at the front. See the funnel-shaped area? Head for that, then drift in slow as you can.\nEVELYN: Phillipe, give me the comms. (INTO RADIO) Would that be directly in range of the Windermere’s microwave receiver, astronaut Brewster?\nBREWSTER: (RADIO) I don’t... Evelyn? Evelyn, is that you?\nEVELYN: And if you thinking of luring us to our doom, you’ve got another think coming! You should be ashamed of yourself, Thomas Brewster.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 123\nVOICE OF AXOS: (OFF) (RADIO) Cease transmission! —\nEVELYN: Well. That told him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: You have failed us, Thomas Brewster!\nAXON DOCTOR: You will be absorbed into Axos!\nBREWSTER: No, no — please! I weren’t to know old Mother Hubbard was aboard. It weren’t my fault! (DESPERATE) The TARDIS. The Doctor’s TARDIS. What if I could get you inside? What would that be worth to you?\nAXON DOCTOR: That would be worth the price of the universe.\nBREWSTER: Hang about — you should have the key. You copied the Doctor, you’ll have copied the key!\nVOICE OF AXOS: The key was — complicated. It is no ordinary key.\nBREWSTER: Well then, best I get you the real one.\nVOICE OF AXOS: You will bring us the key.\nBREWSTER: And in return, you’1ll give up on your plan to take over the Earth?\nAXON DOCTOR: With all of time and space to feast on, we can afford to leave your puny planet alone.\nBREWSTER: No, no, no. I don’t want you to leave it alone. Not exactly. I want you to give it to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74: INT. AXOS — PASSAGEWAY\nJOANNE: (WALKING) There’s tendrils everywhere-!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Then I suggest you avoid them, Ms Slade. Don’t flap about, we don’t want Axos any more awake than it already is.\nDAVID: I don’t understand. Where’s it got all this energy from? The Windermere?\nDOCTOR: The microwave device you intended to use to beam energy to earth. It’s been reversed. I can only assume, Axos is sucking energy directly from the national power grid. Even as we speak, the lights are probably going out all across the United Kingdom.\nDAVID: How is that possible?\nDOCTOR: It’s quite simple. I told them how to do it.\nJOANNE: What?\nDOCTOR: Well, not me. I mean my duplicate. My doppelganger.\nBREWSTER: (OFF) You’re wrong, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thomas Brewster. Fancy meeting you here.\nBREWSTER: Oh, so you’re glad to see me, are you? You’re wrong, Doctor — about the microwave doo-dah. Axos got its power from draining Devesham alone.\nJOANNE: Devesham? It drained Devesham?\nDOCTOR: Of course. Transmitting energy back through the displacement device on the Windermere, connected to Devesham! Well, this is good news!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 126\nDAVID: Good news?!? All our friends, all our colleagues — you’re saying they’re dead!\nBREWSTER: Campbell Irons, too.\nDOCTOR: So much for his scheme. Jo, Mr Brock — I don’t mean to sound heartless. The point is, Axos could only drain Devesham because Axos was linked directly to Devesham, through the displacement field. But the time threshold remains in place. Axos can’t target anywhere else on the Earth, not unless that barrier is broken.\nJOANNE: You mean, it’s not too late to save the world?\nBREWSTER: Old mum Smythe, she’s safe too. The Jules Verne picked her up.\nDAVID: The Jules Verne? But we saw it destroyed. Sucked dry!\nBREWSTER: Naah. I spoke to her. Tipped her the wink. Changed the future, I guess.\nDOCTOR: Thank goodness. Thank you, Thomas.\nBREWSTER: Yeah, geddoff!\nJOANNE: Changed the future? How is that possible-?\nDOCTOR: Within the confines of the time loop, it’s very possible!\nDAVID: The transmission we heard on the Windermere, Jo. Your transmission. Saying the mission had succeeded, and Axos was safe —\nJOANNE: It wasn’t real. Like the destruction of the Jules Verne. None of it was real!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 127\nDOCTOR: A four-dimensional mirage, I’m afraid. The ghost of a possible reality? Maybe, maybe not. Time is in flux, it’s hard to say.\nJOANNE: Then we can change things. David, we can change things!\nDAVID: Roger that.\nDOCTOR: Ms Slade? Are you going somewhere?\nJOANNE: Remember Campbell’s back-up plan? The nuclear reactor, on the Windermere?\nDOCTOR: Jo. It’s not come to that. Not yet.\nJOANNE: But it might do. Good luck, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I was there, Joanne, when the British space programme was in its infancy. Those who worked on it were fearless, brave pioneers. I’m glad to see that flame still burning.\nJOANNE: Thank you, Doctor. And good luck. Come on, David.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER) Send a message to Evelyn! Tell them to get out of the time loop, fast as they can! (BEAT) Come on, Thomas. We need to get back to the TARDIS.\nBREWSTER: You won’t be doing nothing without the key, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, where did you get that [from-?] (CROSS) Did you just pick my pocket?\nBREWSTER: Once a thief, always a thief — ain’t that right?\nDOCTOR: You give that back this instant!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 128\nBREWSTER: Uh, uh, uh! Thing is, Doctor — I don’t trust you. I heard what you said to Evelyn, about leaving me to die.\nDOCTOR: But — you can’t have! What I mean is, I didn’t-!\nBREWSTER: Which is why, well, I’ve decided to live up to your expectations. You’re prepared to let me die to save yourself, why should I be any different?\nDOCTOR: Thomas, whatever you may have heard, I promise you, it was never my intention —\nBREWSTER: Don’t tell me, you were just doing your best. Well, I’m doing my best. Looking out for number one. Which is why I’ve made me a deal.\nDOCTOR: A deal? Who with?\nAXON DOCTOR: (STEPPING IN FROM OFF) A deal... with me.\nDOCTOR: Well, well, well. What have we here? It’s a good attempt, I give you that. Not sure you’ve quite captured my nose, though.\nAXON DOCTOR: Extrude the Doctor’s vessel.\nBREWSTER: Right then. Here’s his TARDIS. And here’s the key, like I\nBREWSTER: promised.\nAXON DOCTOR: You have done well, Thomas Brewster.\nVOICE OF AXOS: (ALL AROUND) Now, Doctor. Now you will give us our freedom!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75: INT. BRIDGE OF SPACESHIP JULES VERNE\nDOCTOR WHO: LeFEVRE: Svenni, can you take us in any closer?\nNILSON: Sorry Philippe. Either we will be caught by the microwave energy or the time distortion may eject us from the barrier altogether.\nNILSON: LeFEVRE : What about manual delivery?\nEVELYN: Manual what? What are you talking about?\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE: We have a bomb. We could use it.\nEVELYN: A bomb?! ?\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE: Only as a final option.\nFUTURE JOANNE: (RADIO) Our mission is a success. Axos is safe. Repeat, Axos is made safe.\nNILSON: Time distortion again.\nEVELYN: I’m still not getting this, though. How is their mission a success? We abandoned the Windermere and were making along the outside to try and get to the Doctor’s, er —\nNILSON: His TARDIS, yes. Like we say, we know all about the Doctor.\nEVELYN: Right. But even if they managed to get onboard, how does that qualify as a success? Or is this some sort of possible future? A potential future that might be, but not necessarily?\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE: So we sit and wait, to see what happens. Then, if Axos is not made safe after all, we step in.\nEVELYN: With your bomb.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: LeFEVRE : As I said — it is the final option.\nDAVID: (RADIO) This is spaceship Windermere, calling spaceship Jules Verne! Come in, please-!\nNILSON: Jules Verne, [receiving-]\nDAVID: Spare us the jargon. Turn tail and cross the time threshold. Repeat, cross the time threshold!\nNILSON: On whose authority-?\nDAVID: The Doctor’s! Do it! Do it now!\nEVELYN: Well, you heard the man, Phillipe!\nEVELYN: LeFEVRE: Burn, Svenni! Burn!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nDAVID: All clear? Jo?\nJOANNE: Yeah. Amazing what a chainsaw can do to an Axonoid. (FX:\nBELTING: UP, STRAPPING IN) Where’s the Jules Verne?\nDAVID: Approaching the time threshold in five, four, three, two, one... They’ve gone.\nJOANNE: Then Evelyn Smythe is safe, at least. Status of Windermere.\nDAVID: We’re still held tight by Axos. If I go for full thrust, it’1l blow the ship apart before Axos lets go.\nJOANNE: And set off Campbell’s booby-trap, on the reactor?\nDAVID: Yes.\nFUTURE JOANNE: (RADIO) This is the spaceship Windermere. Our mission is a success. Axos is safe. Repeat, Axos is made safe.\nDAVID: That message again. Bouncing around the time loop.\nJOANNE: It’s not a mirage, David. Listen. ‘Axos is made safe’. Meaning we stop the threat. That’s our mission. That’s our ‘success’.\nDAVID: I have a family.\nJOANNE: Then all the more reason.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: There. That’s the maths done. Dematerialise the TARDIS, and Axos will follow it out of the loop.\nAXON DOCTOR: I know you, Doctor. As well as you know yourself. You will have tricked us.\nDOCTOR: In that case, my Axon doppelganger, you’re welcome to check the program. Go ahead, be my guest.\nAXON DOCTOR: There is... no trick.\nDOCTOR: See?\nBREWSTER: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Course there is.\nAXON DOCTOR: Thomas Brewster? What do you mean?\nBREWSTER: Prestidigitation, old chum. You’re looking at one hand, but the trick’s being done with the other.\nAXON DOCTOR: (GRABBING BREWSTER BY THROAT) What... do you mean?\nBREWSTER: Alright, alright! (RELEASED) What I mean is, the Windermere’s about to blow up. Axos’1ll stay stuck in the loop, feeding over and over on the explosion.\nDOCTOR: Have you no decency, Thomas Brewster-?\nBREWSTER: Just looking out for meself, Doctor. I’d say sorry, but I can’t say I am, much.\nAXON DOCTOR: Then — I must dematerialise this vessel!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 133\nDOCTOR: No!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78: INT. FLIGHT DECK OF SPACESHIP WINDERMERE\nJOANNE: (INTO COMMS) This is the spaceship Windermere. Our mission is a success. Axos is safe. Repeat, Axos is made safe. We brought this on ourselves, but through our actions we hope we have redeemed the good name of the British Space Programme, and those who went before us. If anyone receives this message, please tell our families that our last thoughts... Our last thoughts were of them. And that we ask them to forgive us.\nDAVID: Ready to go for full thrust.\nJOANNE: Ready.\nDAVID: Then here goes nothing. Three, two, one —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nAXON DOCTOR: The controls confirm it. The explosion has occurred inside the time loop. But Axos is no longer there. Axos is free.\nBREWSTER: Thanks to yours truly.\nDOCTOR: Thanks to you, those astronauts died for nothing!\nBREWSTER: Their choice to mess with Axos. Nothing to do with me.\nDOCTOR: I wish to make Axos an offer. I can take you somewhere utterly devoid of intelligent life. There are regions where you can feed until the heat death of the universe without once coming across anything with an IQ higher than a bowl of porridge.\nAXON DOCTOR: We believe that you could take us to such a region.\nDOCTOR: So will you?\nAXON DOCTOR: No. Axos will feed on Earth.\nBREWSTER: Hey, what about our deal?\nAXON DOCTOR: You would have betrayed us, Thomas Brewster. We read it in your mind. So is it such a surprise that we should betray you?\nBREWSTER: No. I knew you were only keeping me alive for as long as I made myself useful. And all that stuff about the Doctor being prepared to let me die — naah, that’s not how it was, was it? Not really.\nDOCTOR: No, Thomas. No, it wasn’t.\nAXON DOCTOR: It is of no matter. When we have exhausted the Earth, we shall take your TARDIS and feed on the universe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 136\nDOCTOR: Oh, Axos, I’m sorry. I’m so very, very sorry.\nVOICE OF AXOS: You regret your loss.\nDOCTOR: No. I was apologising to you. Thomas, hold him-!\nBREWSTER: (GRABBING AXON DOCTOR) Right you are —\nAXON DOCTOR: There is a trick! Depersonalise! Depersonalise!!!\nBREWSTER: (STRUGGLING) Whatever you’re about to do, Doctor — do it!\nDOCTOR: Fast return switch! Axos is headed straight back into the\nDOCTOR: explosion!!!\nAXON DOCTOR: Nooo-!!! You must not!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80: INT. AXOS — EYE CHAMBER\nVOICE OF AXOS: Alert. Axos returning into time loop. Axos unable to escape\nVOICE OF AXOS: time threshold. Time loop repeating, repeating, repeating...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81: INT. BRIDGE OF SPACESHIP JULES VERNE\nNILSON: See that, Philippe? Axos exploded!\nNILSON: LeFEVRE: And again! And again! And again!!!\nEVELYN: But what about the Doctor and Thomas?!?\nEVELYN: 138\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: (SHAKEN) Hold on tight, Thomas! The TARDIS wasn’t designed to take this sort of turbulence!\nTHOMAS: (SHAKEN) Well, are we gonna get out?\nDOCTOR: (SHAKEN) Honestly? I don’t know!\nBREWSTER: (SHAKEN) If we don’t — I knew you’d have a plan, Doctor. I knew you wouldn’t give Axos what it wanted on a plate!\nDOCTOR: (SHAKEN) Did you really?\nDOCTOR: We’re out. Thomas, we’re out of the time loop!\nBREWSTER: And Axos?\nDOCTOR: Back inside. Going nuclear over and over again.\nBREWSTER: what, forever?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. Only until the loop decays naturally — say, in another six billion years? Long after this galaxy has ceased to support any kind of life, human or otherwise. I’d call that a good day’s work, personally.\nBREWSTER: Err, Doctor... haven’t you forgotten something-?\nDOCTOR: “Forgotten something,” Thomas? No, no — can’t say I have...\nBREWSTER: Axon — monster — thing!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 140\nDOCTOR: Ah, my depersonalised doppelganger. Well, don’t mind him. Cut off from the host body, all he can do is rot.\nDEPERSONALISED AXON DOCTOR: Doc-tor... we will absorb you. Doc-tor!!!\nDOCTOR: I’d like to see you try. But by the looks of it, my friend...\nDEPERSONALISED AXON DOCTOR: Absorb youuuu... (DIES)\nDOCTOR: .. you just don’t have the energy.\nBREWSTER: Cor, that’s disgusting.\nDOCTOR: Fetch a bucket and mop, would you, Thomas?\nBREWSTER: Not keen on cleaning up after your mess, are you?\nDOCTOR: I shall be otherwise engaged. I need to pick up Evelyn.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83: INT. BRIDGE OF SPACESHIP JULES VERNE\nDOCTOR WHO: LeFEVRE:\nDOCTOR WHO: (INTO COMMS) Geneva, This is the spaceship Jules Verne. Our mission is a success. Axos is safe. Repeat, Axos is made safe. We are returning home.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nEVELYN: There they go. Brave, brave men.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — so long as they take the message back with them: humanity will have to solve its energy crises on its own!\nEVELYN: Quite. (BEAT) Well, if you’1ll excuse me, I’ve had enough of lolloping about inside a spacesuit to last me a lifetime. I’1ll leave you boys to it, shall I?\nBREWSTER: Think she wants us to talk, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I made her a promise, back on Axos. I promised to trust you, Thomas.\nBREWSTER: You’re taking me back? To my own time?\nDOCTOR: No more pretending to be me, mind. There isn’t a vacancy!\nBREWSTER: Fair enough. Deal.\nDOCTOR: We’re not so different, you and I. That’s what Evelyn thinks. Both independent spirits, having to rely on our wits to survive, striving to do what’s best...\nBREWSTER: Come off it, Doctor. Do you really think that? Do you really think we’re not different?\nDOCTOR: Well, it was just an observation.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FEAST OF AXOS by Mike Maddox (005 — AB) Page 143\nBREWSTER: Thing is — you’re a Lord. A Time Lord, but a Lord all the same. Any time this gallivanting gets too much to you, you can just go home, and everything will be peachy. Me, I’ve got nothing. No-one. I’ve had to fight to get on in the world, ever since I was a nipper. Nobody’s ever done me any favours - I’ve had to take what I needed. No schooling, no roof over my head. I haven’t had it handed to me on a silver plate. Not like some.\nDOCTOR: I.. take your point. Thomas?\nBREWSTER: Yes?\nDOCTOR: I want you to take you to a strange, beautiful world, still largely unexplored. A place where no-one knows how high the mountains are, how deep the oceans are, or what strange creatures lurk there. Whole continents full of ice, vast deserts, entire civilizations still unmapped and unknown. And everywhere, there is romance, and mystery, and the people who live there have the most extraordinary, inventive, and daring minds imaginable. A world where absolutely anything is possible.\nBREWSTER: Appreciate the offer, Doctor — but I’d rather be on Earth.\nDOCTOR: I was talking about Earth. That’s where we’re going.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
