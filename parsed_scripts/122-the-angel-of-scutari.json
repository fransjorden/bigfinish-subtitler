A more fearful spectacle was never witnessed than by those who, without the power to aid, beheld their heroic countrymen rushing to the arms of death. At the distance of one thousand, two hundred yards, the whole line of the enemy belched forth, from thirty cannon-mouths, a flood of smoke and flame, through which hissed the deadly balls.\nRUSSELL: (FX: CANNON FIRE. HORSES STRUCK. MEN CRYING OUT. THIS IS THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE — A TERRIBLE, ONE-SIDED SLAUGHTER)\nRUSSELL: Their flight was marked by instant gaps in our ranks, by dead men and horses, by steeds flying wounded or riderless across the plain...\nRUSSELL: At thirty-five minutes past eleven not a British soldier,\nRUSSELL: except the dead and dying, was left in front of these bloody Muscovite guns.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 3\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 2: INT.

IN THIS SCENE THE ANTEROOM IS TILED, THE OFFICE CARPETED)\nKITCHEN: Just get on with it, damn you!\nSIDNEY: Very well, Brigadier-general Kitchen. The reason you’ve been called before me is —\nKITCHEN: Just say it, Herbert! You’re demanding I resign my commission on grounds of mental instability.\nSIDNEY: Nothing so dramatic, my dear fellow. Extended leave for perhaps... six months?\nKITCHEN: (FX: THUMPS TABLE) Are you aware of the facts, sir?\nSIDNEY: I read your report. I’ve also received a telegram from Sir Hamilton Seymour in St Petersburg.\nKITCHEN: I got him! I ran the traitor down and I got him! You need men like me. Heroes. I’m a bally hero!\nSIDNEY: (CONCERNED) Bartholomew...?\nKITCHEN: I should not have left St Petersburg. And you cannot prevent my returning. Men like me are needed over there. Men who can make tough decisions.\nSIDNEY: Bartholomew, are you well-?\nKITCHEN: Sebastopol should never have happened! Men have died and it’s your fault! Men have died! (BEAT) No. Thank you for your offer of a period of extended leave, Sir Sidney, but I shall not be requiring it. (WALKING) Good day, Minister.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 4\nSIDNEY: (LOW, TO HIMSELF) Poor fellow. Poor fellow.\nSIDNEY: Come in.\nFLORENCE: Sir Sidney.\nSIDNEY: (FX: HEAVY CHAIR MOVES BACK AS SIDNEY STANDS) Dear lady. Thank you for coming.\nFLORENCE: May I ask who that was? The man who just left?\nSIDNEY: Ah. You heard everything then.\nFLORENCE: He seems a very troubled soul.\nSIDNEY: He is. Please: have a seat.\nSIDNEY: Brigadier-general Kitchen. Ten days ago he ran a Russian collaborator to ground in Kursk, and killed him. Since then he’s not been himself, no-one knows why.\nFLORENCE: Was there a conflagration? Was he hurt?\nSIDNEY: No. He just seems to have taken it rather hard. But how are you, Miss Nightingale? I’ve not seen you since you returned from Germany.\nFLORENCE: Rather anxious to know when you are sending me to Scutari. (FX: RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPER) I have been reading Mr Russell’s correspondences from the Crimea in the pages of The Times. By his account, I cannot depart too soon.

Have you spoken to Richard?\nFLORENCE: Sidney...\nSIDNEY: You never answered my letter, asking about him.\nFLORENCE: Richard has proposed to me.\nSIDNEY: Well, why on Earth didn’t you say?!? That’s marvellous!\nFLORENCE: And I have turned him down.\nSIDNEY: Oh Florence, you’re insufferable! That poor man has been in love with you for longer than I’ve known you. And you with\nSIDNEY: him. Why do you torture yourself like this? Marry the man!\nSIDNEY: He’s a baron, for goodness’ sake —\nFLORENCE: Sidney, please. I learned so much in Germany. The dedication I saw towards the sick and deprived... That is my ideal. It is very selfish of me to live my life this way, I know, but that is between me and God.\nSIDNEY: Then the fellow should give you a good talking-to, if you ask me! Sorry.\nFLORENCE: I know my own heart as well as He does, and I have come to understand that I must deny myself the love of a man. That is Simply the way it has to be.\nSIDNEY: Poppycock!\nFLORENCE: I can live without love. I cannot live without my work. (BEAT) When do I leave for Scutari?\nSIDNEY: (HEAVY SIGH) The aim is for you to arrive by the second week in November.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 6\nFLORENCE: A fortnight?\nSIDNEY: You'll have to start the day after tomorrow, at the latest. Won’t be all on your own, of course —\nFLORENCE: I should hope not —\nSIDNEY: First-rate fellow turned up there out of the blue, a week or so ago. Some sort of medico.

What are you doing?\nACE: (SOTTO) Yeah, yeah, the sailor’s seen us. We’re supposed to be captured, remember?\nDOCTOR: I’m supposed to be captured. Sir Hamilton’s report said nothing about you.\nTOLSTOY: (OFF) You men — follow me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 9\nACE: Now he tells me-!\nDOCTOR: Nothing our Mister Russell read about, anyway. Certainly, he didn’t mention you, back at Scutari.\nACE: So I’m staying at large then. What else did this report say?\nDOCTOR: That when I was brought to St Petersburg, my clothes were covered in blood.\nACE: (SARCASTIC) Nice —\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Here they come. Stay down! I don’t think they’ve seen you —\nTOLSTOY: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Come out from there! Come out or my men will drag you out!\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) No need for that — Ensign, is it?\nTOLSTOY: Arrest that man!\nDOCTOR: On what charge-?\nTOLSTOY: Signalling to the British fleet!\nDOCTOR: Don’t be ridiculous — (ALARM) Duck!!!\nTOLSTOY: What-?\nTOLSTOY: (FX: IMPACT AND SPLINTERING OF RIGGING.

(FX: CLATTER OF SCABBARDED SWORD ON DECKING) Just don’t expect me to bring the blue box back as well.\nDOCTOR: Hurry!\nTOLSTOY: I wonder what the odds are of me surviving this.

Tact and all that.\nKITCHEN: Well it’s beyond the pale, it really is.\nRUSSIAN DUNGEON GUARD: Follow me. (FX: WALKS)\nKITCHEN: (WALKING) What’s this fellow’s name, anyhow?\nSEYMOUR: (WALKING) All he’s giving is ‘The Doctor’, apparently.\nKITCHEN: (WALKING) A medico?\nSEYMOUR: A daring one, certainly.\nKITCHEN: (WALKING) They’re only daring until they’re dead. Then they’re just dead. Someone shall have to cure you of that romantic streak, Seymour.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 14\nSEYMOUR: (WALKING) Ah, but this fellow’s the stuff heroes are made of: makes his own way to Sebastopol, smuggles himself aboard a Russian warship, then signals the fleet’s location to our boys!\nKITCHEN: (WALKING) If he were an infantryman, acting under orders, I'd pin a medal on his chest myself. But he’s not, he’s a civilian, and as such he’s a nuisance and a damn fool!\nRUSSIAN DUNGEON GUARD: (FX: STOPS. JANGLING OF KEYS THROUGH:) Just one moment —\nSEYMOUR: Oh, come on, Barty. After all, you’re a hero yourself. About a bally dozen times [over —]\nKITCHEN: (AGGRESSIVE) Don’t call me that!\nSEYMOUR: Oh, come now, don’t be modest —\nKITCHEN: (COVERING UP HIS OUTBURST) Soldiers don’t like to be singled out so much. We’re part of an army. If we win the battle then we're all perishing heroes.\nKITCHEN: (MORE TO SELF) In any case, it’s for God to decide who’s a hero and who not.\nKITCHEN: (ALOUD) He’s in here, is he? This idiot?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, IN CELL) Come in! Come in!\nRUSSIAN DUNGEON GUARD: I wait outside.\nSEYMOUR: Jolly good. Yes —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: INT. CELL (ST P’BURG) [LATE SEP]\nSEYMOUR: (APPROACHING) Your name is ‘the Doctor’, I believe?\nDOCTOR: Usually. I don’t suppose you’ve brought a couple of spoons with you, by any chance?\nKITCHEN: You’re not planning to dig your way out-?\nDOCTOR: Failing that, at least I could entertain myself with a tune.\nSEYMOUR: I say, your clothes are covered in blood!\nDOCTOR: It’s not mine. It belongs to my friend. Ace.\nSEYMOUR: Ah, yes —\nKITCHEN: His accomplice?\nDOCTOR: Something like that. Tell me she’s alive and well.\nSEYMOUR: A telegram arrived from Sebastopol ahead of you. Your friend is recovering in Fort Alexander.\nDOCTOR: That’s.. a relief.\nSEYMOUR: Took a bit of a bump to the noggin, I’m told, but she’s being well looked after.\nDOCTOR: If the conditions there are anything like those in Scutari I seriously doubt it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT.

It is miles off.\nACE: Is it?\nTOLSTOY: Good morning.\nACE: I feel like a Dalek just sat on my head.\nTOLSTOY: Well, I’m not sure what a Dalek is, but if it is something large, heavy and nasty —\nACE: That’s a Dalek all right —\nTOLSTOY: . then, yes, that would be a fair expression of how you must be feeling.\nACE: I remember you. The ensign — (WINCES AGAIN)\nTOLSTOY: Don’t try and move. As well as the head wound, you’ve broken two ribs.\nACE: Where’s the Doctor?\nTOLSTOY: Now that’s annoying.\nACE: What’s annoying?\nTOLSTOY: That you should inquire about your accomplice before asking who I am or where you are. That’s another twenty-five roubles I owe Odakhovsky.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 17\nACE: Let’s just say I like to avoid clichés. And what’s with all this “accomplice” business?\nTOLSTOY: Please don’t try to protest you are not a British spy. Apart from anything else, I didn’t think to lay a wager on it...\nACE: Tell you what, I’ll meet you halfway. I’1ll guess for myself that I’m under constant guard in some kind of military hospital in Sebastopol... and I’1l let you tell me where the Doctor is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. CELL (ST P’BURG) [LATE SEP]\nSEYMOUR: I’m Sir Hamilton Seymour, the Ambassador here in St Petersburg. This is Brigadier-general Bartholomew Kitchen. I have to say, Doctor, we’re all terribly proud of you.\nDOCTOR: I suspect that Tsar Nicholas doesn’t share your enthusiasm, having thrown me in his best dungeon on arrival.\nSEYMOUR: Fair’s fair, old man. You are the enemy, after all.\nKITCHEN: So — one of these sightseers, are you?\nDOCTOR: Excuse me? Sightseers?\nSEYMOUR: That’s what we call you lot. You civilian fellows that get into your little boats and tag along behind the troopships, all the way from England and up the Bosporus. Some of you, it seems, have even made it across the Black Sea. Good show!\nKITCHEN: Damn foolish, if you ask me —\nSEYMOUR: (JOKINGLY) Barty doesn’t like people stealing his thunder, Doctor. He’s the biggest hero we’ve got around here —\nKITCHEN: (SUDDENLY, AGGRESSIVELY) I told you! No-one’s a hero in this farce of a war! (BEAT, THEN CONTINUES CALMER) Oh, there’s nothing to learn here. If you’1ll excuse me, I have my duties to attend to. Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Now there’s a man with something on his mind...\nSEYMOUR: (UNCOMFORTABLY) Anyway, just thought we’d put our heads round the door, as it were.\nKITCHEN: (OFF) Guard! Guard!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 19\nSEYMOUR: You’1l be presented to the Tsar in a few days’ time. Not the most straightforward of chaps, but easy enough to rub along with. Once you get to know him, of course —\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we’ll get on heroically.\nSEYMOUR: (UNCERTAINLY) Yes, well.. See you in a couple of days, then.\nDOCTOR: I’1l look forward to it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. SMALL ROOM (FORT ALEXANDER, SEB’POL) [LATE SEP]\nACE: Well? Where is he?\nTOLSTOY: After your — accident — the night before last, the Doctor was taken by train to St Petersburg, to answer to Tsar Nicholas.\nACE: Right...\nTOLSTOY: He is quite unharmed. You will remain here at Fort Alexander, Since you are too weak to travel.\nACE: (WINCES, UNCOMFORTABLE) You’re not wrong there.\nTOLSTOY: My name, although you seem less than interested to know it, is Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy.\nACE: Tolstoy? What, as in the writer?\nTOLSTOY: You’ve read my work?\nACE: Umm — not recently, no.\nTOLSTOY: No. Two stories are all I’ve had published. In The Contemporary. But I’m working on a series about Sebastopol at the moment.\nACE: Course you are. When your duties as an Ensign allow.\nTOLSTOY: . actually, I’m a Count.\nACE: I should be impressed then, should I?\nTOLSTOY: Most women are.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 21\nACE: Are you trying to chat me up, Lev? Cos if you are, I’d like to point out I’m a suspected enemy agent and apparently pretty much on my deathbed. The word “inappropriate” leaps to mind.\nTOLSTOY: It’s true that I’ve never before had anyone quite so beguiling placed in my charge. And it’s not often I get to speak with an English person.\nACE: Right. What odds did this Odakhovsky give you that you couldn’t pull me?\nTOLSTOY: ‘Pull’?\nACE: Come on.\nTOLSTOY: . Evens. He was being generous — it wasn’t certain you’d survive the night.\nACE: Charming. Lev, me old mate —\nTOLSTOY: . yes?\nACE: . devilishly handsome as you are...\nTOLSTOY: . yes...\nACE: .. you've just lost your stake.\nTOLSTOY: “Charming”. Would it make any difference if I told you it was I who jumped into the water to save you last night, after your brains had been all but dashed across the deck?\nACE: You saved my life?\nTOLSTOY: If it wasn’t for me you may have been washed away from the moorings and into one of the harbour mines. Then you’d have had a headache...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 22\nACE: (AWKWARDLY) Thanks.\nTOLSTOY: . The fact is, you weren’t in any immediate danger. You'd grabbed hold of the blue box that went over with you.\nACE: The TARDIS! Where is it?\nTOLSTOY: Probably halfway across the Black Sea by now. Was it part of your spying equipment?\nACE: We’re not spies, OK?! (WINCES AGAIN)\nTOLSTOY: (STANDING) I think I should leave you now to recover, but I very much hope we will speak again. (MOVES OFF)\nACE: Ace.\nTOLSTOY: (STOPS) Excuse me?\nACE: My name. It’s Ace.\nTOLSTOY: So that’s why your Doctor kept on saying it!\nACE: Well, duh.\nTOLSTOY: I took it for some sort of exclamation. Well... Ace. It’s a pleasure to meet you. (FX: OPENS DOOR) Now try to rest. You’1ll most likely be moved to a local prison before the end of the week.

The seventeenth of October, 1854.\nACE: (WALKING, ALOUD) The [seventeenth-? ]\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, LOW) Approximately.\nACE: (WALKING, LOW) And Hex knows this-?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, LOW) If any period of Earth history needed a nurse from the future, this is it.\nACE: (WALKING, LOW) We’d better find him. He’s going to want to get involved.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, LOW) So long as he doesn’t make too much of an impression...\nACE: (WALKING, LOW) You’re the expert. Suppose it might even do him some good. You know, after what happened with the Daleks on Bliss. Bit of luck the TARDIS plonking us down here.\nACE: (WALKING, LOW) Still, best if we give him a heads-up, yeah?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Ace -\nACE: (EXITING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION) Low profile, I know. I’m not a beginner at this.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER HER) Ace. I think he knows. Ace-/!!\nDOCTOR: (LOW) So much suffering. So much death...\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOUBLE INTERIOR DOORS OPEN, RUSSELL ENTERS CORRIDOR, STOPS)\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello!\nRUSSELL: (ASTONISHMENT) Good God almighty! You!!!\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and I’m looking for my friend, Hex. I wonder if you’ve seen — (DOUBLE-TAKE) What do you mean, ‘me’?\nRUSSELL: (MARCHING OVER) I knows who you are, sir! Right down to your jersey! (GRABBING DOCTOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: (GRABBED) Let go of [me-]\nRUSSELL: Stop your squirming! (ALOUD) You! Private Preston!\nPRESTON: (ARRIVING) Yes, Mr Russell?\nRUSSELL: Take up your musket and train it on this man!\nPRESTON: What, sir?\nRUSSELL: He is wanted on suspicion of treason against the Crown!\nDOCTOR: Page 30\nDOCTOR: Treason?!? Rubbish! (BREAKING FREE) I don’t know who you think\nDOCTOR: I am, sir, but I shall not be detained a moment longer —\nRUSSELL: Don’t move, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (TURNING, WALKING AWAY) Good day to you —\nRUSSELL: Oh, for the love of God, Preston —\nPRESTON: Mr Russell-?\nRUSSELL: Shoot him, man! Shoot him afore he runs!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. OFFICE (WHITEHALL) [LATE OCT]\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: LONG REVERSE ECHO INTO REPRISE FROM SCENE 1, TO SIGNIFY\nTIMESHIFT: )\nSIDNEY: (READING) Schofield. ‘Thomas Hector Schofield.’ Regular angel of mercy, by all accounts.\nFLORENCE: Well, I look forward to making his acquaintance.\nSIDNEY: Good, good. (FX: STANDING, PUSHING BACK CHAIR) Well then. God speed, Miss Nightingale —\nFLORENCE: Of course, Sir Sidney. (FX: RISING) There’s just one thing —\nSIDNEY: Is there now?\nFLORENCE: Brigadier-general Kitchen. What’s to become of him-?\nSIDNEY: I’m to take him off active service for a time, perhaps for good. PM’s orders. A shame. He was a good soldier, despite everything —\nFLORENCE: Let him come with me to Scutari.\nSIDNEY: Oh, now, Florence —\nFLORENCE: I can help him understand that God has forgiven him.\nSIDNEY: Dear lady, you’ll have enough to contend with as it is. It’s a hell of a mess out there, by all accounts. Terrible misjudgement at Balaclava three days ago. No-one knows what Cardigan was thinking. Doubt the fellow knows himself.\nFLORENCE: I shall talk to the Prime Minister myself if I have to.\nSIDNEY: (SIGHS) You are...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 32\nFLORENCE: Insufferable?\nSIDNEY: (WALKING) Very well, then, Miss Nightingale, I shall square things with the Prime Minister.\nFLORENCE: (WALKING) Thank you, Sir Sidney.\nFLORENCE: This collaborator. The man Bartholomew Kitchen killed. Was it a friend of his?\nSIDNEY: No, not at all. Another mystery medico, in fact. Some strange fellow known only as... ‘the Doctor’.\nSIDNEY: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 33"

Maybe you can’t help it.\nDOCTOR: I find it’s better than carrying arms.\nRUSSELL: Make your enemies destroy each other, you mean. Interesting. Maybe you hate the Russian Empire as much as the British. Maybe you see yourself as better than all of us.\nDOCTOR: I can see that nothing I say is going to dissuade you of my guilt. And I have to say, Mr Russell, that doesn’t bode well for the quality of your journalism.\nRUSSELL: What were you doing in Sebastopol on the night of the twenty- fifth of September? The night you were ‘captured’ by the Russians?\nDOCTOR: Sebastopol? Oh yes. The siege must be, what, a month old by now? All that cannonfire. All that wanton destruction —\nRUSSELL: All of which was caused by you!\nDOCTOR: It was-?\nRUSSELL: You knew that the city was to be taken on the twentieth with naval support, so you passed information through your man in Constantinople to the effect that the Tsar was considering surrender.\nDOCTOR: I seem to be terribly well connected.\nRUSSELL: So the fleet was held back, the British stayed outside Sebastopol, and the Russians were able to dig trenches and shore up the city tighter than an Irishman on St Patrick’s Day.\nDOCTOR: Did I really do all that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 43\nRUSSELL: Oh you’re a proud one, alright. You think you know something I don’t, don’t you? I can see it in your eyes.\nDOCTOR: (RISING TO THE BAIT) And are you proud, Mr Russell? Proud of the way the British Empire has conducted itself? How it has perpetuated this needless war?\nRUSSELL: The War Office decided —\nDOCTOR: The War Office! This should have ended months ago! The Russians had withdrawn from the Balkan territories before the British Army had even arrived!\nRUSSELL: There is still a Russian military threat —\nDOCTOR: A threat that has been created! A bear that has been goaded!\nRUSSELL: Our boys weren’t sent here for no reason!\nDOCTOR: No. So with no enemy in sight, they were ordered to press on into the Black Sea and destroy the Russian navy once and for all! Is opportunism something to be proud of, Mr Russell?\nRUSSELL: You want to know what I’m proud of? I’m proud of the way our boys have come to the other side of the world to fight for the stability of the world their children shall inherit —\nDOCTOR: A stability built on war-mongering!\nRUSSELL: If the Russians control this part of the Ottoman Empire they’1l move their Black Sea ports south. Maybe as far round as the eastern Mediterranean. From there, they could control the world.\nDOCTOR: Control the world, dominate the universe. It’s always the same old justification.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CHAIR SCRAPES BACK AND CLATTERS TO THE FLOOR. HEAVY IMPACT OF FIST ON TABLE.

Balaklava, the twenty-fifth October. And now occurred the melancholy catastrophe which fills us all with sorrow. Lord Lucan gave the order to Lord Cardigan to advance his Light Cavalry brigade upon the Russian guns. The noble Earl, though he did not shrink, also saw the fearful odds against him. Don Quixote in his tilt against the windmill was not near so rash and reckless as the gallant fellows who prepared without a thought to rush on almost certain death. There was a plain to charge over, before the enemy’s guns were reached, of a mile and a half in length.\nRUSSELL: At ten minutes past eleven, the Light Brigade advanced...\nRUSSELL: (FX: FADE UP.

The bloody massacre resulting admits of no description...\nBAYONET: . Scutari, the eighteenth November. I return to the hospital to find that the diminution of our numbers every day is a cause of serious anxiety.

In the absence of a surgeon, we must proceed. Hot irons, please, Mr Schofield.\nHEX: Hot irons. Right. (BEAT) Are you sure-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 59\nFLORENCE: Quite sure, Mr Schofield.\nRUSSELL: It’s always a mercy when the hot irons come out. Least the smell of burning flesh covers the stink from the drains some.\nHEX: Oh God. The drains. I’m so sorry, Miss Nightingale. I’ve been trying for weeks to get something done about them, but...\nFLORENCE: But-—-?\nHEX: Look, I’m sorry. I haven’t done a good enough job for you.\nFLORENCE: For me-? Whatever can you mean?\nHEX: I-I just meant... I don’t know what I meant.\nFLORENCE: Hot irons! Now, Mr Schofield!\nFLORENCE: (FX: HEX TAKES A COUPLE OF STEPS THEN STOPS — KITCHEN ARRIVES AT THE SAME TIME, THEY SCUFFLE. SLOSH OF LIQUID IN LARGE-ISH\nMETAL: CONTAINER)\nHEX: (EXPRESSION OF BUMPING INTO SOMEONE) Sorry.\nKITCHEN: That’s quite alright, doctor.\nHEX: I’m not — oh, doesn’t matter.\nRUSSELL: (LAUGHS) Away you go, lad. (CALLING) But she’1ll still be here\nRUSSELL: when you get back, so!\nKITCHEN: Here’s the oil you needed, Miss Nightingale.\nFLORENCE: Thank you, Brigadier-general, I’1ll take it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 60\nKITCHEN: May I help with something else, Miss?\nFLORENCE: Perhaps you could make sure Mr Schofield doesn’t burn down the barracks, collecting the hot irons?\nKITCHEN: Right away, Miss.\nFLORENCE: Mr Russell — would you help me fill these lamps?\nRUSSELL: Right you are.\nRUSSELL: (FX: CORK PULLED FROM CONTAINER. METAL LAMP SET DOWN ON TABLE.\nUNDER THE NEXT LINE: DOUBLE DOORS OPEN, OFF, KITCHEN EXITS,\nDOORS: CLOSE, AND GLASS LAMP UNSCREWING FROM METAL LAMP BASE.\nGLASS: SET DOWN ON TABLE)\nRUSSELL: If you don’t mind my saying, you seem to have brought with you your own personal Brigadier-general there.\nFLORENCE: I do mind you saying, as a matter of fact, Mr Russell. Your implication is lascivious.\nRUSSELL: Lascivious am I?\nFLORENCE: Brigadier-general Kitchen and I struck a firm friendship on the journey here, rooted in a shared belief of Our Lord, and that is all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 61\nRUSSELL: Well then, that’s me told. But don’t you be telling me you don’t know the effect you have on the menfolk. Just look at our Thomas Schofield. He’d fallen for you soon as he looked at you. Hook, line and the whole shebang, as they say.\nFLORENCE: (CROSS) Mr Russell, I hardly think the unwanted attentions of a well-meaning idiot should worry me any-!\nRUSSELL: Slow down there, Miss. Only having a bit of fun with you so. No harm meant. (BEAT) ‘Sides, Schofield’s no idiot.\nFLORENCE: Yes, so I’m told. You may replace the cover of that lamp, Mr Russell —\nHEX: (OFF, BEHIND DOORS, RAISED YELL) Bill! Bill!\nFLORENCE: What the devil...?\nRUSSELL: That was him. (ALOUD) Thomas-?\nHEX: (OFF, BEHIND DOORS, TO BARTY) What are you doing?! For God’s sake-!\nKITCHEN: (ENTERING, DRAGGING HEX) It’s unforgivable!\nRUSSELL: Hoy there, you! Brigadier-general! Put that man down!\nHEX: Bill! This guy’s gone off his head!\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew? You’re among friends, Bartholomew, all is well.\nHEX: Yeah? I’m not! He just went for me with his fists!\nKITCHEN: There are some things even God cannot forgive!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 62\nRUSSELL: Thomas, move away slowly.\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew-?\nKITCHEN: We are at war! And in war nothing can forgive collaboration. God demands penance! And for your actions — the penance is death!\nHEX: Aw, gettoff-!\nKITCHEN: No!\nFLORENCE: Put the weapon down, Bartholomew.\nRUSSELL: (COMMANDING) Brigadier-general! Sheathe your blade, man!\nKITCHEN: You - stay out of this!\nRUSSELL: (WALKING) Well, if it’s a fight you'd be after...\nFLORENCE: Mr Russell! No!\nRUSSELL: To me, lad!\nHEX: (SCRAMBLING UP) Thanks, Bill. That guy’s a nutter!\nFLORENCE: (WITH KITCHEN) Bartholomew? Are you alright-?\nKITCHEN: Yes, yes. (TO HEX) ‘Nutter’ I may be, but you, sir — you are a collaborator!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 63\nHEX: No, mate. You’ve got this all wrong.\nRUSSELL: Come on, now. I’ve known Thomas Schofield there more than a month, and a man less likely to be a collaborator you’1l not find in these here barracks.\nKITCHEN: He’s just admitted it to me himself!\nHEX: I didn’t say nothing!\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew?\nKITCHEN: He implicated himself!\nFLORENCE: Mr Schofield — did you say anything that could have been misconstrued in any way?\nHEX: Look, all I said was... He asked me how I’d got here. If I was a Sightseer, whatever that means. And I said I’d arrived with two friends... But that they were dead now, for all I know.\nFLORENCE: And is that when the Brigadier-general struck you?\nHEX: No. I said... (BEAT) I said I wished Ace and the Doctor could've met you. Miss Nightingale.\nRUSSELL: (SHOCKED) The Doctor?\nHEX: (SHEEPISH) Yeah.\nRUSSELL: Ace... and the Doctor?\nHEX: Sorry, Bill. I know you guys didn’t exactly get off on the right foot, that’s why I never mentioned them to you before, like.\nRUSSELL: Brigadier-general. My apologies to you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 64\nHEX: Oh God, here we go.\nRUSSELL: I suggest you arrest this man Schofield for suspicion of collaboration in wartime. Before I beat him black and blue myself.\nRUSSELL: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 65"

I’ve dined with Tsars and danced with Czarinas. Crossed wits with emperors and crossed swords with kings. I know what I’m doing.\nSEYMOUR: (WORRIED) Nonetheless, protocol dictates —\nDOCTOR: Protocol is for dullards.\nNICHOLAS: (IN NEXT ROOM, COUGHING, ILL) He may approach.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Don’t worry, Ambassador. I shall endeavour not to offend etiquette. (FX: WALKS THROUGH DOOR, ACROSS PARQUET FLOOR)\nSEYMOUR: Best of British, then — (REALISATION, HISSED) Your hat, man! Remove your [hat—]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT. STATE ROOM (ST P’BURG) [EARLY OCT]\nDOCTOR: Your Majesty. I’m the Doctor.\nNICHOLAS: So you are.\nDOCTOR: We've never met before, but I have it on good authority that I’m a close personal friend of yours.\nNICHOLAS: Yes. (COUGHS) You may sit.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nNICHOLAS: So. I’m told you helped the British destroy my fleet at Sebastopol?\nDOCTOR: I’m told so, too.\nNICHOLAS: (BORED) Yes... I was warned you could be rather oblique.\nDOCTOR: Now. Having established my guilt — what’s the plan, your Majesty? Fake my escape from your dungeons and set me up as a double agent?\nNICHOLAS: You should have to present a convincing traitor first.\nDOCTOR: .. Or I might be a triple agent, yes. Perhaps I’m not an agent at all.\nNICHOLAS: There is a samovar prepared. Help yourself to tea.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (FX: CLINK OF FINE CROCKERY) Such fine crockery. And such lovely spoons. (FX: TAPS SPOON AGAINST CROCKERY) Real gold, if I’m not mistaken.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 67\nNICHOLAS: (BORED) Yes, yes...\nDOCTOR: I’1l be mother. (FX: POURING TEA) So. This war of yours. What do you think of it so far, your Majesty?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT.

HEAVY KEY\nINSERTED: INTO AND TURNED IN A LOCK. CELL DOOR OPENS)\nACE: Mr Writer Man. You again.\nTOLSTOY: I. Yes. (SETTING DOWN TRAY) I have brought you breakfast, Ace.\nACE: Yeah, and you can take it right back. Wouldn’t feed it toa Killoran —\nACE: (ALOUD) Pack it in!!! (TO TOLSTOY) They’ve been doing that Since the crack of dawn. The sentries. Playing some stupid game.\nTOLSTOY: (CROSSING TO WINDOW) Ah yes. They are balancing on tent pegs.\nACE: Hilarious. I know they’re balancing on tent pegs. Why?\nTOLSTOY: Because if they stay on long enough I give them a piece of ginger cake or some tobacco, whatever they have a fancy for. (ALOUD, TO SOLDIERS BELOW) Dolohov is cheating again! You make him do it on the left leg, now! (TO ACE) It is good fun. (BEAT) Ace. You must eat the gruel.\nACE: Yeah, you try it, Lev!\nTOLSTOY: You think I get any different?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 69\nACE: . Besides, how are you supposed to eat breakfast without the back of a cereal packet to read?\nTOLSTOY: ‘Cereal-?’\nACE: I’ve read everything these walls have got to offer. (READING) “Natasha, my love! February the sixth 1802.” “Innocent! Nikolai Petrovich, December the nineteenth 1841.” “Book me a seat on the next TARDIS out of here. Ace, October the second 1854.” (BEAT) Oh, pass the gruel, will you?\nTOLSTOY: Look on the bright side. At least you can read Russian.\nACE: (EATING) Yeah — (SUDDEN REALISATION) Oh my God!\nTOLSTOY: Ace-?\nACE: I can read Russian! There’s me thinking the TARDIS was —\nTOLSTOY: TARDIS-—?\nACE: (TO SELF) .. and all the time, I’m reading Russian, talking Russian —\nTOLSTOY: Evidently.\nACE: Stupid, stupid, stupid —\nTOLSTOY: Ace-?\nACE: (LOW, TO HERSELF) OK. Escape from Russian prison. Find TARDIS somewhere in the Crimea. Track down the Doctor in St Petersburg. (BEAT) Three impossible things before breakfast it is, then...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. STATE ROOM (ST P’BURG) [EARLY OCT]\nNICHOLAS: . The war, yes. I doubt I shall win.\nDOCTOR: No-?\nNICHOLAS: You don’t look sorry for me, Doctor. People are always feeling sorry for me. Your Sir Hamilton, he feels sorry for me. But he doesn’t do anything to help me.\nDOCTOR: (FX: PASSING TEA) Your tea, your Majesty.\nNICHOLAS: Thank you, Doctor. (SLURPS TEA) Brigadier-General Kitchen, he is worse, for he pities me.\nDOCTOR: I took him for a man of conscience.\nNICHOLAS: True. I have no time for pity. But a man of conscience has something I can use.\nNICHOLAS: (FX: DOCTOR SETS SPOON ON SAUCER; CUP BRIEFLY SCRAPED ON SAUCER)\nDOCTOR: And which do you think I will offer you, your Majesty? My sympathy, or my pity?\nNICHOLAS: I would say you are a man of conscience, Doctor. You say what you mean, what you think must be said. Your air of mockery tells me you honour this in your actions also.\nDOCTOR: You think I mock you?\nNICHOLAS: You don’t sympathise, like Seymour does. You show no tendency to pamper me with platitudes. Yet you don’t pity me either. It’s almost as if you... empathise...\nDOCTOR: You bear a great responsibility, Tsar. You keep your people alive, you keep your country going. You’ve achieved remarkable\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: things in the running of your Empire, yet you remain outwardly unremarkable yourself.\nNICHOLAS: This is the destiny of some men. And does that sound like you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nNICHOLAS: (SIGHS) Oh, I cannot decide what to do with you. To free a guilty man would be foolish. But to execute an innocent would weigh heavy on my conscience.\nDOCTOR: (SLURPS TEA) Well, yes —\nNICHOLAS: (CRUEL) I do not wish to be made a fool. And I have more than enough on my conscience. (CALLING) Guard! (COUGHS)\nNICHOLAS: Return this man to my dungeons. I do not wish to see him again.\nDOCTOR: But — I thought we were getting along. We’re having tea!\nNICHOLAS: I defer my judgement. If it means you live out the rest of your days beneath my palace — so be it. (TO GUARD) Take him away.\nDOCTOR: Let go of me, there’s no need for this!\nNICHOLAS: I have no use, Doctor, for men of conscience who do not pity me. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: (DRAGGED AWAY) No! Get off me! This isn’t right!\nNICHOLAS: (LOW) No use at all...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT. SMALL ROOM (FT ALEXANDER, SEB’ POL) [EARLY OCT]\nACE: (TO TOLSTOY) You still here, Lev-?\nTOLSTOY: Of course. I have not told you the news yet.\nACE: The Doctor. You’ve heard something about the Doctor-?\nTOLSTOY: No. No, I am afraid not. Ace, you will be leaving Fort Alexander. Today!\nACE: They’re letting me go-?\nTOLSTOY: No. You will be transferred to another prison.\nACE: Great. Guess it can’t be any worse than this.\nTOLSTOY: But it is. Army prison, the conditions are terrible. But you\nTOLSTOY: are a lucky lady, Ace.\nACE: Yeah, I’m not feeling all that lucky right now —\nTOLSTOY: . for three reasons. One, the new prison is out of range of\nTOLSTOY: the British guns.\nACE: Suppose I might at least get a good night’s sleep.\nTOLSTOY: Two, it is early October.\nACE: So-?\nTOLSTOY: The cold weather is killing the flies.\nACE: Right —\nTOLSTOY: Mind you, soon it will start to kill the prisoners also.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page\nACE: Yeah, I’m not sure ‘lucky’ quite covers that one.\nTOLSTOY: (DARK) You have not yet seen the new prison.\nACE: Three reasons, you said?\nTOLSTOY: Oh, yes. I am to transport you there.\nACE: And then-?\nTOLSTOY: Hard to say. We have to assume that the chain of command remembers about you at all.\nACE: Oh, great. Same goes for the Doctor, I suppose-?\nTOLSTOY: (DEADPAN) Who?\nACE: 73\nACE: Funny. (BEAT) Right then, Lev. You going to take me to prison,\nACE: or what?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. CORRIDOR (ST P’BURG) [EARLY OCT]\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Let me go! I tell you there’s been a mistake! This isn’t what is supposed to happen!\nKITCHEN: (APPROACHING) Guard, what’s going on here?\nDOCTOR: Brigadier-general Kitchen! Contrary to what I’d been led to believe, the Tsar isn’t going to arrange for my so-called ‘escape’ —\nKITCHEN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: So I was wondering if you and Sir Hamilton couldn’t pull a few strings, and get me ‘unincarcerated’?\nKITCHEN: If you’re a prisoner of war there’s not a great deal we can do until the war’s over. You should have stayed at home, Doctor. Let it be a lesson to you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t let it trouble your conscience. (DESPERATE) I know you have a conscience, Brigadier-general. The Tsar himself told me all about it!\nKITCHEN: What do you mean by that?\nDOCTOR: I wonder what he could have meant, though? Probably nothing. Although a man with a conscience, a military man, who disagrees with the war policy of his own country...\nKITCHEN: I don’t know what it is you think you know, Doctor...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: A man who may even be ashamed of it. What could such a man’s conscience lead him to, I wonder?\nKITCHEN: . but I assure you you do not want to play games with me.\nDOCTOR: Oh, this isn’t a game, Brigadier-general. This is a war. And war makes people do terrible and shameful things. But you know that already — don’t you, Bartholomew Kitchen?\nKITCHEN: Guard! I believe you have your orders.\nKITCHEN: (MOVING OFF) I suggest you carry them out and throw that man in the palace dungeon.\nDOCTOR: (LOW, PLEASED WITH HIMSELF) Well... That seems to have stirred things up a bit...\nDOCTOR: (FX: LONG ECHO ON DOCTOR’S LINES AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME\nTO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 76\nKITCHEN: (TO HEX) ‘Nutter’ I may be, but you, sir — you are a collaborator!\nHEX: No, mate. You’ve got this all wrong.\nHEX: hacd\nFLORENCE: Mr Schofield — did you say anything that could have been misconstrued in any way?\nHEX: Look, all I said was... He asked me how I’d got here. If I was a sightseer, whatever that means. And I said I’d arrived with two friends... But that they were dead now, for all I know.\nFLORENCE: And is that when the Brigadier-general struck you?\nHEX: No. I said... (BEAT) I said I wished Ace and the Doctor could’ve met you. Miss Nightingale.\nHEX: SCENE 31: INT. KITCHEN’S ROOM (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew? Are you resting? Bartholomew...?\nKITCHEN: (LOW, TO HIMSELF, QUOTING THE DOCTOR) “What could such a man’s conscience lead him to...?”\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew, I wish to speak to you about Thomas Schofield —\nKITCHEN: (TO SELF) .. I wonder.\nFLORENCE: Are you quite well, sir?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 77\nKITCHEN: . Thomas Schofield, you say? The boy’s a traitor, Miss Nightingale. A collaborator, by heaven!\nFLORENCE: You are here to assist with the medical effort, Bartholomew. And it would be of the greatest assistance to me if you were to withdraw your allegations regarding Thomas Schofield! They are disruptive, distracting and, from what I gather, entirely without foundation!\nKITCHEN: I shall determine his innocence.\nFLORENCE: You shall not, sir. That comes within the purview of Our Lord.\nKITCHEN: The Doctor was a double agent. A spy in the pay of the Tsar! Schofield — Schofield is guilty by his self-confessed association!\nFLORENCE: He is a boy! And a more innocent-looking one I can scarcely imagine...\nKITCHEN: Ask Russell, madam! He knows! He’1ll tell you!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. HOLDING CELL (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nHEX: Bill, it was a month ago! The Doctor left a month ago and I don’t know where he is!\nRUSSELL: (TO SELF) Sure, that’s the worst cup of tea I’ve ever had. Tastes like the inside of a Muscovite’s breeches.\nHEX: How long are you gonna keep us locked up here? Bill?\nRUSSELL: As long as needs be, lad. (BEAT) Why didn’t you tell me you knew the Doctor?\nHEX: Cos I knew you’d get me arrested! I didn’t think anyone would try and kill me, though...\nRUSSELL: You admit he’s a traitor then.\nHEX: The Doctor is not a traitor! And neither am I. Bill, you’ve known me a month. We’re friends. Then Kitchen turns up and suddenly you think I’m public enemy number one!\nRUSSELL: (YAWNS) I don’t know what to think, to give you the truth of it.\nHEX: You look tired...\nRUSSELL: Not too tired to keep an eye on you, don’t be worrying yourself about that now. (YAWNS) I am feeling awful tired, mind —\nHEX: Yeah. That’1ll be the pentobarbital kicking in.\nRUSSELL: (DROWSY) ‘Pento-bubb-it-all’?\nHEX: (FX: STANDING UP, SCRAPING BACK CHAIR) Tastes like the inside of a Muscovite’s breeches. Apparently.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page\nRUSSELL: (DROWSY) Something... something in the tea?\nHEX: Fraid so. Stay there, Bill.\nRUSSELL: (DROWSY) What’s that? Hey! You’re not going anywhere, you —\nHEX: (SOFTLY) Just close your eyes, mate...\nRUSSELL: (DROWSY) Damn, but me legs won’t — won't...\nHEX: (SOFTLY) It’s just a sedative. It won’t hurt you.\nRUSSELL: (DROWSY) Thomas, you’re a... a...\nHEX: I know, mate.\nHEX: 79\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. KITCHEN’S ROOM (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nKITCHEN: (FX: DRUG FX) Russell! Wake up, man! Russell!\nRUSSELL: Whuh-?\nKITCHEN: (FX: DRUG FX) Dammit —\nKITCHEN: (FX: SPLOSH OF COLD TEA IN RUSSELL’S FACE. SHIFT TO NORMAL\nPERSPECTIVE: )\nKITCHEN: Awake now-?\nRUSSELL: (SPLUTTERING) Tea! Cold tea. Damn!\nKITCHEN: What d’you think you’re playing at, sleeping on duty?\nRUSSELL: Kitchen. I’m not — I wasn’t...\nKITCHEN: He’s escaped! Thomas Schofield!\nRUSSELL: . I’m not on duty, sir!\nKITCHEN: Never mind that, we have to find him!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. CHAPEL (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nFLORENCE: (LOW, CLOSE) I light this candle in His name.\nFLORENCE: (ALOUD) Come in, soldier. Don’t be afraid. The chapel is a place of peace.\nFLORENCE: Come. Kneel beside me. We can pray together, if you’d like.\nHEX: (LOW) It’s me, Miss Nightingale.\nFLORENCE: (SHOCK) Thomas Schofield! But... (BEAT; LOW) The Brigadier- general has got soldiers looking for you everywhere.\nHEX: (LOW) Yeah. I’ve been buried in this greatcoat for hours. Thought you’d come here sooner or later.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) You’ve been waiting for me-?\nHEX: (LOW) Yeah.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Surely you don’t expect me to help you escape the barracks?\nHEX: (LOW) What good’s escaping gonna do me? My only friends in the world are more than likely... (TRAILS OFF) Well, if they’re still around, they’1ll be expecting to find me here. Look. I came here to Scutari to help. I still want to do that, if I can.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Well then. That explains it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 82\nHEX: (LOW) Explains what?\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Why, the mystery of you, Thomas Schofield.\nHEX: Of me-?\nFLORENCE: Before I left London, I met with Sir Sidney Herbert — he’s the [Minister for War—]\nHEX: . Minister for War, yeah —\nFLORENCE: . Well, he told me all about your strange and sudden appearance. An angel descended upon Scutari, to minister to the sick...\nHEX: (LOW) You what-? (BEAT) Look — it’s you’s the angel, not [me]\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Don’t make light of it, Thomas.\nHEX: (LOW) But it is! You’re pretty much a saint, you are. Someone who gives themselves over completely to what they believe. I don’t. I just help people. I can turn it on or off.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) And you will turn it off when your friends return?\nHEX: (LOW) I guess. I have got a life outside hospitals and that, you know.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Ah. Not like me, is that correct?\nHEX: (LOW) Oh, hey, I didn’t mean —\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Sir Sidney despairs of me, too. He thinks I should be married. In fact, he even suggested I might employ my so- called “feminine wiles” in pursuit of the mystery of you.\nHEX: (LOW) Do what-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 83\nFLORENCE: (LOW) I asked him if he quite remembered to whom he was speaking. To his credit he blushed rather at that.\nHEX: (LOW) (DISAPPOINTED) No wiles. Fair enough.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Are you disappointed, Mr Schofield-?\nHEX: (LOW) Well, you are pretty hot.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) I beg your [pardon-?!?]\nHEX: (LOW) Oh, hey. It’s just something they say where I come from. It’s a compliment.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) It sounds more like a blasphemy. (BEAT) The two friends you say you’ve lost; are they the ones Mr Russell was talking about?\nHEX: (LOW) Ace and the Doctor, yeah. But he’s wrong about them being collaborators.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Are you close to them?\nHEX: (LOW) The Doctor’s not the easiest of guys to get close to. But yeah, I think so. And Ace... I thought at one point I really wanted to get close to her. You know?\nFLORENCE: (LOW) I know.\nHEX: (LOW) But I’m not so sure anymore. Ace is.. well, she keeps you guessing. Any time she kissed you, you’d think it could be the last.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) You... kiss her a lot?\nHEX: (LOW) You kidding? She’d break my arm if I tried! I miss her, though. Her and the Doctor. But it’s like — like they’re a package deal, you know. You don’t get one without the other.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 84\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Are they — related?\nHEX: (LOW) You’d think so sometimes, listening to them argue. I'd always had the idea of travelling with the Doctor as this temporary kind of thing. That it’d end. It’s not like that for Ace, though. Maybe it was once, but not any more.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) But your heart is still in England.\nHEX: (LOW) Kind of. I belong somewhere. The Doctor doesn’t. Or he belongs everywhere, I don’t know. And Ace belongs with him. If they’re still alive, I hope they’re still together.\nFLORENCE: (LOW) Thomas, I —\nHEX: What? What is it?\nFLORENCE: I don’t know how to tell you. In London, Sidney told me that the Brigadier-general had hunted down and killed a traitor in Kursk. A man known only as the Doctor.\nHEX: (LOW) What about Ace?\nFLORENCE: (LOW) I don’t know. (PAUSE) Perhaps we should pray for them both-?\nHEX: (STANDING; A BIT TEARY) Won’t do them any good, though, will it?\nFLORENCE: Don’t go, Thomas. Let me talk to Bartholomew again. Perhaps he can be persuaded he was mistaken —\nHEX: What — about me being a traitor? Or about his killing my friend? (WALKING) Oh, look — I think I just want to go now. Find out for sure what happened to Ace.\nFLORENCE: Thomas —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 85\nHEX: (FX: WALKING) They called me Hex. Me name’s Hex.\nFLORENCE: (FX: GETTING UP, GOING AFTER HIM) Thomas. Come back. Thomas —\nHEX: Save it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. CORRIDOR (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nRUSSELL: Stay right where you are, Thomas Schofield.\nHEX: Bait\nRUSSELL: Put your hands where I can see ‘em.\nHEX: Listen, I don’t want any trouble —\nRUSSELL: Good. You wouldn’t want to make it any harder on yourself, lad. (CALLING OFF) Kitchen! Kitchen!!!\nFLORENCE: (ENTERING) What’s the meaning of —\nHEX: See for yourself. You gonna shoot me, Bill? Really?\nFLORENCE: Mr Russell, what d’you think you’re doing? The chapel is a place of worship-!\nRUSSELL: Ah, but this would be the corridor outside the chapel, Miss Nightingale. I’m desecrating nothing.\nHEX: Been waiting for me, have you, Bill?\nRUSSELL: Reckoned there was one person round here you was soft enough on to seek out.\nHEX: You reckoned right.\nFLORENCE: Mr Russell! Lower your weapon. Please-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page\nRUSSELL: (FX: LOWERS MUSKET) Ah, but it’s only for show. For sure there’s no shot inside — see? (BEAT) Still, you’1ll give yourself up to me, lad. If you know what’s good for you.\nHEX: You’ve got to be kidding.\nRUSSELL: You’11l just be locked up ‘til all this can be sorted out, that’s all.\nHEX: Right. And your Brigadier-general is gonna settle for that, is he-?\nRUSSELL: he\nHEX: He’s gonna have me shot. So I’m not stopping. (WALKS)\nRUSSELL: (OFF) Thomas, please! I’m trying to give you a chance here!\nHEX: (WALKING, RAISED) I’ve not done nothing wrong! All I’ve tried to [do is-]\nKITCHEN: (HOLLERED FROM OFF) Stop right there, Schofield!\nHEX: Aw, hell. (STOPS)\nKITCHEN: (FX: STRIDING DOWN CORRIDOR) You’re going nowhere, traitor!\nFLORENCE: (RUSHING UP) Bartholomew!\nKITCHEN: Out of my way, Miss Nightingale —\nFLORENCE: Set your pistol aside, Bartholomew. (CALLING OFF) And you,\nFLORENCE: Thomas Schofield, you do as the Brigadier-general asks and\nFLORENCE: stand where you are! (BEAT) Now. This matter may be settled fairly if you would both but come together and speak to one another as gentlemen!\nRUSSELL: (OFF) She’s right, lad.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 88\nFLORENCE: Thomas? What do you say?\nHEX: If your Brigadier-general will hear me out, yeah.\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. CITY OF SEBASTOPOL [EARLY OCT]\nTOLSTOY: (TO HORSE) Steady now.\nACE: (WINCING) Lev-! Injured woman here!\nTOLSTOY: I apologise!\nACE: Yeah, cobblestones and broken ribs don’t mix. Is it far? Cell Block H?\nTOLSTOY: The prison? Not far. Just at the bottom of the hill.\nACE: Thanks, Lev.\nTOLSTOY: What for? Ace?\nACE: Coming to see me every day. Keeping me company.\nTOLSTOY: It was a pleasure, I assure you. And to be honest I had an ulterior motive.\nACE: Don’t tell me. Odakhovsky?\nTOLSTOY: Uh-huh. Bet me seventy-five roubles you would either be shot or sent to St Petersburg without having kissed me. Not that I wouldn’t have wanted to kiss you if he had not made the bet. I mean, I would have tried anyway. To kiss you. Or rather to get you to want to kiss me. If you see what I mean...\nACE: Well, seeing as I won’t see you again...\nTOLSTOY: You make it sound like you are expecting to die. You are not so badly injured.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 90\nACE: Just shut up, will you? (KISSES HIM. A BIT LINGERING)\nTOLSTOY: (BREAKING OFF) Well...\nACE: Don’t spend the money all at once. And sorry.\nTOLSTOY: Don’t be —\nACE: I meant — Lev, this is my last chance to escape. So — (STRAINS WITH EFFORT, SHOVING HIM OFF CART)\nTOLSTOY: (SURPRISE) What — waaaah!\nTOLSTOY: (FX: TOLSTOY’S YELL MOVES OFF. IMPACT AS HE HITS THE COBBLES,\nOFF: )\nACE: Sorry! Sorry!

Whatever you are, can you promise me you’re not a collaborator?\nDOCTOR: What I can promise you, Ambassador, is that the identity of the collaborator will be revealed in due course.\nSEYMOUR: It will-?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely.

They are simple, noble people.\nACE: You really are a writer, aren’t you?\nTOLSTOY: What do you mean by that?\nACE: Well, it’s all romantic exaggeration, isn’t it?

I think that should do the trick.\nSEYMOUR: So this... bottle... will enable you to find your friend, Ace. Like a compass.\nDOCTOR: In a manner of speaking, yes. I coated the TARDIS key with a thin saline solution mixed with dried particles of Ace’s blood from my pullover.\nSEYMOUR: Yes. I’m not really following a word of this, you know, but it sounds bally clever.\nDOCTOR: The residual energy in the key oxidises the blood and serves to suspend it in the oil. See?\nSEYMOUR: And you’re telling me that’s pointing towards this Ace?\nDOCTOR: . and the markings here indicate the approximate distance between St Petersburg and Sebastopol.\nSEYMOUR: Well I never.

We’1l abandon the horses in the forest — the dogs will follow their scent, not ours!\nACE: (RIDING HARD, SHOUTING BACK) Just make sure you keep up with\nACE: me, Writer Man!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE [OCT]\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP TO COUNTER) Good day. This is the telegraph office, yes? (FX: UNFOLDING PAPER) I’d like you to send this message to Sir Hamilton Seymour, care of the royal palace in St Petersburg. It’s rather urgent, so I’1ll wait for the reply.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 52: INT. BRITISH EMBASSY (ST P’BURG) [OCT]\nSEYMOUR: (TO SECRETARY) Take a letter. (DICTATING) For the attention of the Doctor, from Sir Hamilton Seymour, British Embassy, St Petersburg. Message reads: Sorry to hear of demise of your marvellous contraption. Stop. All information suggests Ace still heading north. Stop. Pursuers forcing her towards city of Kursk. Stop. Expected there within two days. Stop. God speed. Stop. Message ends.\nSEYMOUR: SCENE 53: EXT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE [OCT]\nKITCHEN: (WALKING QUICKLY TO HORSE) We’ve got him, Lieutenant! Telegraph operator says he was here at this office yesterday. He’s heading for Kursk! (FX: MOUNTING HORSE) We’1l be there by midnight. And when we do — (FX: REINS) — I’1l be going in alone!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: EXT. KURSK STREET [OCT]\nTOLSTOY: (STOPS, BREATHLESS) Kursk. At last.\nACE: Lev. Come on. There must be a stable or something.\nTOLSTOY: I do not believe I can go any further, Ace — horse or no horse.\nACE: I meant to sleep in, dummy.\nTOLSTOY: No. It is too dangerous. The soldiers will be here by morning. (DECISIVELY) Ace - you go. I shall wait here. When they arrive, I shall try to send them in the wrong direction.\nACE: But what if they catch you-?\nTOLSTOY: I will say you were a double agent all along. Failing that, I will buy them off.\nACE: What with?\nTOLSTOY: Odakhovsky’s seventy-five roubles, of course! (BEAT) Go. Find your Doctor. Find your TARDIS.\nACE: It was nice to meet you, Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy.\nACE: (FX: RUNNING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING — THE DOCTOR'S. WITH KITCHEN ON HORSEBACK NOT FAR BEHIND)\nTOLSTOY: (LEANING OVER HER) Come closer. The pleasure was [all mine —]\nACE: . Leave it out, Lev. Someone’s coming-!\nTOLSTOY: I hear hoofbeats. Oh God, they have gained on us-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: (OFF, RUNNING) Aaaaaaaaace!\nACE: I don’t believe it —\nTOLSTOY: Impossible. It cannot be —\nACE: It bleeding well can! (FX: RUNNING TO MEET HIM) Doctor! Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: (FX: RUNNING TO HALT) Ace-!!!\nACE: (FX: RUNNING UP) I don’t get it. How’d you know to find me [here-? ]\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS) No time —\nKITCHEN: (FX: RIDING TO HALT, OFF) Oh yes! Doctor! I have you now-!\nACE: I’m guessing the guy on horseback waving a sabre isn’t friendly-?\nDOCTOR: Far from it!\nKITCHEN: (FX: DISMOUNTING AND STRIDING PURPOSEFULLY UP) Ten days and two hundred miles later, here we are. Stand, sir! You should stand and face me, not cower in some peasant woman’s shadow!\nACE: (CALLING) Oi-!!! I don’t know who you are, pal, but you are so not making a good first impression!\nKITCHEN: An Englishwoman-?!?\nTOLSTOY: (FX: STRIDING TO STOP — AT OPPOSITE SIDE OF SOUNDSCAPE TO KITCHEN) Yes, sir. And she is no peasant!\nDOCTOR: (BEMUSED) Ace...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 113\nKITCHEN: Oho, and a Russian Ensign! Why, I do believe I’ve stumbled on a viper’s nest of spies and traitors!\nACE: (TO DOCTOR) That’s Lev. Remember?\nTOLSTOY: Do you accuse me, sir?\nKITCHEN: I do, sir!\nDOCTOR: (TO ACE) You know, his face seems oddly familiar. Couldn’t put my finger on it before —\nACE: (TO DOCTOR, FAUX-INNOCENT) No-?\nTOLSTOY: (FX: UNSHEATHING SWORD — SHING!) Then — prepare to die, sir!\nTOLSTOY: TOLSTOY/KITCHEN:\nTOLSTOY: (FX: CHARGING TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER, IE TO MEET IN THE CENTRE OF THE SOUNDSCAPE, AND CONTINUING THROUGH ACE/DOCTOR DIALOGUE\nBELOW: ) Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.. /Haaaaaaaaaaaaaah...\nDOCTOR: (TO ACE) Never mind that now. Quickly, Ace. Before our two acquaintances hack one another to pieces — hug me.\nACE: What-?\nDOCTOR: Our lives depend on it!\nACE: Well, if you say so — (THEY HUG)\nACE: What the-?\nDOCTOR: Now — stand well back-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 114\nACE: The TARDIS-?!?\nDOCTOR: (WARNING TOLSTOY & KITCHEN) You two — mind!\nTOLSTOY: /KITCHEN: (FX: CHARGE INTO THE SUDDENLY SOLID TARDIS) .. aaaaah!\nTOLSTOY: (FX: HEADS KLONK!

It’s —\nDOCTOR: . white, I know. I’1l explain later.\nTOLSTOY: (STIRRING) Ace-?\nACE: We'll be off now, Lev. Thanks for everything.\nTOLSTOY: (GROGGY) Don’t mention it —\nDOCTOR: His face really is familiar...\nACE: Yeah, before your sabre-wielding chum comes back for more?\nDOCTOR: Of course — (REALISATION) Oh no! The key!\nACE: Don’t tell me you’ve lost it-?\nDOCTOR: In the forest. When my Ace-detector shattered...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 115\nACE: Obviously. (FX: ‘REVEAL’ STING) Just as well I thought to bring a spare...\nDOCTOR: (CROSS) But that should be —\nACE: . in a cubby hole above the ‘P’ of “Police Box”, yeah.\nDOCTOR: (SNATCHING KEY) Give me that. (FX: OPENING DOOR) (ENTERING TARDIS) The spare key is not to be removed!\nACE: (FOLLOWING) Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say —\nKITCHEN: (STIRRING) What-? (REALISATION) No! No!!! Come back, damn you! Come back!\nTOLSTOY: Too late, comrade. They are gone. Dis-apparated. I think, therefore, our disagreement is ended? (FX: TRUDGES AWAY)\nKITCHEN: Dis-apparated..? But - they can’t! (INTO THE AIR) Doctor! Come back! Doctor! DOCTOR-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. TARDIS (CONTROL ROOM)\nACE: Am I glad to be back in here!\nDOCTOR: (BUSY) Yes, yes...\nACE: So come on, then: how’d you do it? Bring the TARDIS back? You got a sneaky remote control, or something?\nDOCTOR: In a sense. You’re my remote control, Ace. The TARDIS followed you to me.\nACE: Do what?\nDOCTOR: The readings confirm it. As I suspected: when the cannonball hit the TARDIS in Sebastopol, it caused the Hostile Action Displacement System to activate.\nACE: Yeah, but — white TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well. The cannon shot must have shattered her corporeal shell.\nACE: Must have. Yeah.\nDOCTOR: I daresay most of it ended up drifting in the Black Sea.\nACE: So all the while the TARDIS has been floating in the vortex —\nDOCTOR: . waiting for you to find me, Ace —\nACE: . she’s been growing a new shell-?\nDOCTOR: In essence, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 117\nACE: Still a Police Box, though.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure the colour will come, in time. (FX: BLIPS) Now — let’s see what Mister Hex has been up to...\nACE: Whoa whoa whoa! Backtrack there a minute. ‘Remote control’? ‘Waiting for me to find you-?’\nDOCTOR: The sea is not a fixed substance. So when the TARDIS sensed that you were holding on to her when you both went into the water at Sebastopol, she chose to re-emerge from the vortex at your space-time location.\nACE: Riiight —\nDOCTOR: Alas, you’re not a Time Lord, so she couldn’t trace you.\nACE: . I get it. The hug!\nDOCTOR: Fooled her into thinking you had the double hearts-beat of a Time Lord, [yes —]\nACE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: A hypersonic pulse emanating from the area of Turkey, at ten- fourteen p.m. on the nineteenth of November, 1854.\nACE: Hypersonic-?\nDOCTOR: (ACCUSATORY) Hex!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 118\nFLORENCE: . Now. This matter may be settled fairly if you would both but come together and speak to one another as gentlemen! [...] Thomas? What do you say?\nHEX: If your Brigadier-general will hear me out, yeah.\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew...?\nKITCHEN: I say the boy’s a collaborator. To hell with him.\nFLORENCE: Bartholomew, no-!!!\nRUSSELL: (RUSHING OVER) Damn it, Kitchen —\nHEX: Oh God. Ace —\nHEX: SCENE 56: INT. CORRIDOR (BARRACKS, SCUTARI) [MID-NOV]\nRUSSELL: Now what in heaven’s name did you do that for-?\nKITCHEN: (FX: RELOADING PISTOL THROUGH:) The Doctor isa proven collaborator. Thomas Schofield is a self-confessed associate of the Doctor.\nRUSSELL: And that means he has to die?\nHEX: (GASPING) Oh God, that hurts-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 119\nFLORENCE: (WITH HEX) Thomas. Let me see.\nHEX: It’s me shoulder —\nFLORENCE: I know. (FX: RIPPING MATERIAL)\nKITCHEN: (TO RUSSELL) Everyone has to die! Our army was delayed for days outside Sebastopol. And now they are dying! Don’t you see? They all have to die! (FX: PISTOL RECOCKED) Save your efforts, Miss Nightingale. A shot through the heart will end his misery.\nRUSSELL: (SHOUTING) Brigadier-general! Shooting this boy will not appease your own daemons!\nHEX: (WOUND TOUCHED) God-!\nFLORENCE: Stay still, Mr Schofield! I can see — the shot has passed through the clavipectoral fascia...\nHEX: Anything else-?\nFLORENCE: . I need more light. Mr Russell! Procure me a lamp, if you please!\nHEX: I don’t believe it. The one time the Lady with the Lamp’s without a lamp, is when she’s treating me —\nFLORENCE: Be quiet!\nRUSSELL: . A lamp. For sure, yes —\nKITCHEN: Don’t move-!\nRUSSELL: Brigadier-general, whoever yer man here has for friends, I won’t let him die for the want of a lamp — and there’s an end poo yee i ot\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 120\nKITCHEN: I’m warning you-!\nHEX: Bill, for God’s sake get out of the way, he’ll just shoot you too —\nFLORENCE: Lie still. There is — much blood.\nHEX: Listen. Miss Nightingale. Florence. In the pocket of me tunic, there’s this — kind of wand thing?\nRUSSELL: (TO FLORENCE) It’s no good, Miss Nightingale. Reckon as we’re gonna have to dig it out, with our fingers, like —\nHEX: (TO FLORENCE) Just — give it here, will you-?\nFLORENCE: This is no time for magic tricks, Mr Schofield!\nHEX: Please. He’s gonna kill me for it, but I’m dead otherwise. If you see what I mean.\nFLORENCE: (FX: RUSTLING IN TUNIC) This-?\nHEX: That’s it. Give it here —\nKITCHEN: (STRIDING OVER) What the devil-?\nRUSSELL: What is it, lad?\nHEX: Hypersonic scalpel —\nFLORENCE: (TAKING IT) For surgery? It is — warm.\nKITCHEN: Hand it over, Miss Nightingale.\nFLORENCE: What, Bartholomew? Would you shoot me too?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 121\nKITCHEN: I — I don’t know. (ANGRY) Hand it over!\nFLORENCE: Very well —\nFLORENCE: (FX: KITCHEN’S BOOT STAMPS ON SCALPEL. SHATTERS. PULSE CUTS OFF)\nHEX: Well, that’s me done for —\nFLORENCE: Do you — hear something?\nKITCHEN: No-!!!\nHEX: Oh yes-!\nKITCHEN: Apparating again! The white box-!\nHEX: Eh-?\nRUSSELL: What in heaven’s name-?\nDOCTOR: (EXITING TARDIS) Hello. Us again. Brigadier-general.\nHEX: Doctor! Ace!\nACE: Oh my God, what’s happened?\nKITCHEN: Keep back! Oh, but I won’t squander my second chance. This time, Doctor, you’1ll stay dead — (GRABBED BY THROAT BY RUSSELL) — glurg!\nRUSSELL: No, but I shan’t squander me first.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 122\nKITCHEN: (GASPING) Please — let go of me —\nRUSSELL: Not until you drop the pistol —\nRUSSELL: There’s a good fellow. Now sit down-!\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Mr Russell. First things first:\nACE: (FX: RUSHING OVER) .. Hex.\nFLORENCE: Stay out of the light, please-!\nACE: If you stay out of my face, mush-!\nFLORENCE: I beg your pardon-?\nHEX: Yeah, don’t fight, girls —\nDOCTOR: I think he’s in good hands, Ace. Miss Florence Nightingale, I presume-?\nFLORENCE: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: Delighted to make your acquaintance. Now: Mr Russell. I’m sure my friend Ace here will be more than willing to apologise to you later...\nACE: .. yeah, or give you the chance of a rematch...\nDOCTOR: . but in the meantime, would you please contact Sir Hamilton Seymour in St Petersburg. He will validate my credentials.\nRUSSELL: Ah, but you’1ll have to do better than that —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 123\nFLORENCE: This is the Doctor? The man you killed, Bartholomew?\nACE: Killed-?\nKITCHEN: They dis-apparated! What else could I say?\nACE: Erm, why was he so eager to kill you, anyway?\nDOCTOR: Well, because when we met in St Petersburg, I hinted to the Brigadier-general that I knew his secret.\nACE: Secret-?\nDOCTOR: . and after that, he had to try and eliminate me. By fair means or foul.\nRUSSELL: What secret-?\nKITCHEN: Oh, can’t you guess, man-? I — I was the one who alerted the Tsar to the naval action of the twentieth of September. I am responsible for the army being stalled outside Sebastopol. Me!\nRUSSELL: You were the traitor-?\nFLORENCE: Of course. This is the burden that torments you so. Isn’t it, Bartholomew?\nKITCHEN: It’s all wrong, this war! It isn’t just! There’s no honour in it. No nobility.\nACE: I met someone in Sebastopol who thinks the same way. But he’s not perpetuating it by selling information to the enemy.\nKITCHEN: I sold nothing! I just thought it would stop. I thought we’d turn back when it was plain that the Russians were dug in at Sebastopol, that the war would be over.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Every act of hostility is done in the name of peace...\nKITCHEN: (WEEPING) I’m sorry. So sorry —\nRUSSELL: Ah, stop snivelling, man —\nFLORENCE: (SHAKING HEX) Mr Schofield? Thomas?\nACE: What have you done to him-?\nHEX: (VERY WEAK) It’s alright, Ace. Really.\nDOCTOR: Let me see —\nFLORENCE: He is — fading somewhat, I’m afraid.\nRUSSELL: Poor lad. Perhaps I should fetch the chaplain, like?\nFLORENCE: No. I shall treat him here —\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary. Ace, help me with him —\nFLORENCE: You can’t move him!\nACE: Yeah — (HOISTING HEX; EFFORT) —\nACE: . but he could catch anything in this place-! No offence, but can’t you smell it?\nHEX: Miss Nightingale. Florence. I have to go, like —\nFLORENCE: Where to-? The white box-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 125\nACE: If anyone asks, just say the angels took him.\nFLORENCE: But —\nDOCTOR: Come on-!\nRUSSELL: Well, would you look at that-?\nKITCHEN: ‘The angels took him’. Ha! (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)\nFLORENCE: Quiet, Bartholomew. (BEAT) The way I see it — Thomas Schofield was an angel already.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: INT. TARDIS (CONTROL ROOM)\nACE: Hurry up, Doctor! I don’t like the look of him —\nHEX: (WEAK) So what’s new, eh-?\nACE: Shut it, you.\nHEX: I’m sorry, Doctor. About the scalpel, like. You know I’d never have —\nDOCTOR: (BUSY) Time and a place, Mister Hex!\nHEX: (TO ACE) Tell him — tell him I know he was only trying to make me feel better about meself. You know, after Bliss —\nACE: I’1l have words, don’t worry.\nHEX: Yeah, yeah. Time and a place —\nACE: Doctor! Wherever we’re going, we need to get there fast-!\nHEX: Don’t wanna be in any poncey space hospital, mind. There’s only one time and one place I wanna be right now —\nDOCTOR: I realise that, Mister Hex! And that — is precisely where we’re going!\nACE: Where-?\nHEX: He knows — (GROANS, PASSES OUT)\nACE: Hex? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR: .

Not yourself.\nKITCHEN: (LOW, CLOSE) Perhaps.\nFLORENCE: (LOW, CLOSE) God forgives, Bartholomew.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ANGEL OF SCUTARI by Paul Sutton (FINAL) Page 129\nKITCHEN: (LOW, CLOSE) Not me, Miss Nightingale. I will not let him. There are some things that a man cannot bear; that he does and then cannot live with. It is correct and proper that he cannot live with them. I do not ask for forgiveness. I am doing penance in the eyes of God. That is all I ask. That I suffer for what I have done.\nFLORENCE: (LOW, CLOSE) I understand. But the idea of paying penance is that it ends, Bartholomew. You balance your sin. You must at some point say, Enough.\nKITCHEN: (LOW, CLOSE) And you, Florence?\nFLORENCE: (LOW, CLOSE) Me?\nKITCHEN: (LOW, CLOSE) When will your suffering have been enough?\nFLORENCE: (LOW, CLOSE) Let us pray together, Bartholomew.
