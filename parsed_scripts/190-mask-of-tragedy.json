Instead, I'm here as your chorus.\nACE: Every Greek play should have one, apparently. And I've nothing better to do for a bit.\nACE: The Doctor says that when theatre started it was almost by accident. People gathered to hear poems sung about heroes. And then, one day, someone stepped forward from the choir and pretended to be the hero. That was how it all began. With a hero.\nACE: The thing is, the chorus got left behind. Standing around like gooeseberries while the hero did his hero thing. There were rules for plays. Unity of time, unity of place. You had to have a hero. A villain. And you always had to have a chorus whether you wanted them or not. Lurking. Waiting. Doing the gossip. Hollyoaks, basically.\nACE: So, since there are rules, and I've always loved rules, I'm going to be your chorus. With your help.\nACE: Any questions, girls? No? All right then.

CLEON'S PALACE.\nDIONYSOS: (narration) And while that was going on, Lord Cleon, the arrival of the strangers had reached your ears in the palace...\nTELEPHUS: My noble Lord Cleon! Strangers have been sighted in the Theatre of Dionysus.\nCLEON: Strangers, spymaster?\nTELEPHUS: Aliens.\nCLEON: Tourists, now?!? Our city's starving and the universe comes to gawp for their amusement.\nCLEON: ct ct\nTELEPHUS: Yes, my Lord.\nCLEON: Can we blame them for something? The plague, perhaps?\nTELEPHUS: Well, the Winged Fury has been sighted again. Hovering over the bodies of the walking dead.\nCLEON: (fearful) Don't talk about it! (PAUSE) Near the walking dead? Could it be what’s causing the plague?\nTELEPHUS: I don't know.\nCLEON: I pay you to know! (SIGHS) Sorry, Telephus. I'm tired. Of this war, of the unruly people, of aliens, of...(SOFT) My pursuer.\nTELEPHUS: Aristophanes?\nCLEON: (forced laugh)\nCLEON: No, not him. Freedom of speech is vital for our democracy. By all means he should publicly humiliate me at the festival. Let him say what he likes!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 18\nTELEPHUS: I could find out what he's going to say, my lord.\nCLEON: No. (PAUSE) Could you?\nTELEPHUS: Of course, my lord.\nCLEON: (laughs to himself) Doesn't really matter. He's just one more problem. Among so many.\nCLEON: (gasps in pain) Why do you haunt me, Fury? Ever since the battle at Amphipolis...

I'm a big fan.\nARISTOPHANES: Well hello. Really?\nTYRGIUS: It is Euripides, isn't it?\nARISTOPHANES: (groans) Yes. The finest tragedian that ever lived. I'm just rehearsing my dancing wine.\nTYRGIUS: Oh. Forgive me, sir, but this seems more like one of those awful comedies by...\nARISTOPHANES: Ha! Got you! I'm Aristophanes, the comedian. At your service.\nTYRGIUS: I've... (SIGHS) Got it wrong again.\nARISTOPHANES: Yes, you have rather.\nTYRGIUS: Sorry. I'm Tyrgius of Nephelokokkygia (Neff-ello-cock-edge-ia). I'm here on holiday.\nARISTOPHANES: In Athens? During war and plague? Where did you say you were from? Nephelokokkygia? Cloud Cuckoo Land?\nTYRGIUS: (halting) Well....\nARISTOPHANES: Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 21\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. Definitely an alien.\nTYRGIUS: I don't know what you mean...\nTHE DOCTOR: Thought so.\nTYRGIUS: But what have I got wrong? My telegenic disguise doesn't seem to be working very well.\nARISTOPHANES: Little tip - We Greeks are handsome folk, Tyrgius, but not even our finest look like you.\nTYRGIUS: I'm too good-looking?\nARISTOPHANES: Sometimes it requires a comedian to tell the truth that no-one else can. Young man, you are far too gorgeous.\nTYRGIUS: Oh dear. That would explain the furora in the agora.\nARISTOPHANES: Uh huh. Keep away from my cast, would you? They're already dropping like flies. The last thing I need is a lovesick suicide.\nTYRGIUS: I can't get anything right. I didn't come on one of the organised tours. I'm a traveller, not a tourist. I wanted to experience the real Athens. To learn Tragedy at the hem of Euripides and study Philosophy at the feet of Socrates.\nARISTOPHANES: Tell Socrates I sent you. He does a one-day package for aliens. All the hits - ideal forms, shadow on the cave, and (GRITS TEETH) why Athens should exile playwrights.\nARISTOPHANES: Now, come my friend. Stay and watch the rehearsal. So much still to do... (CALLS) Wineskins, prepare to dance!\nTYRGIUS: Perhaps I'll leave you to it.\nARISTOPHANES: (MUTTERS) Tourists! Typical, absolutely typical.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: START TO SING.\nTYRGIUS: (walking away) I can't get anything right. I just wanted to fit in, to help...\nTELEPHUS: Excuse me, my friend, excuse me!\nTYRGIUS: No thank you, I'm really not interested.\nTELEPHUS: Burt...\nTYRGIUS: I don't need a tour guide and I don't want to buy a vase.\nTELEPHUS: My friend -\nTYRGIUS: And I'm sure your unmarried sister is very nice, but no thank you.\nTELEPHUS: You don't understand me, my friend.

Or the night after.\nTHE DOCTOR: So, I was wondering... there's a mystery here.\nACE: Finally!\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector, shall we go and investigate?\nACE: Oh, what?!?\nTHE DOCTOR: Best you stay out of trouble.\nACE: Cos I'm a woman?\nTHE DOCTOR: Because I need you to keep an eye on Aristophanes, Ace. Please.\nACE: In case he does something funny?\nTHE DOCTOR: No, there’s no danger of that. But there's something\nTHE DOCTOR: going on here I don't like....\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. CLEON'S PALACE\nCLEON: Throw him down there.\nTYRGIUS: Why are you doing this? I'm just a visitor!\nCLEON: You're an alien. And I am Cleon, Ruler of Athens.\nTYRGIUS: (groans) I know who you are. Your guards were rough.\nCLEON: They're about to get rougher.\nTYRGIUS: (to himself) This is turning out to be a dreadful holiday.\nTYRGIUS: Are you all right?\nCLEON: (snaps) Yes! I'm fine (BREATH) Let's have a look at you. Well, my guards haven't spoiled your looks.\nTYRGIUS: (groans) Oh no, not you too.\nCLEON: Save it, alien. I need your help.\nTYRGIUS: How?\nCLEON: Your kind disgusts me. You come to gawp at the splendours of Athens. But you don't notice that I'm... that we're tired. This city's falling apart and everyone blames me. I've done all I can, but I can't win - the Spartans are coming and there's nothing more I can do. Unless... you help me.\nTYRGIUS: Me?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 26\nCLEON: Yes, alien. Weapons. You must have something.\nTYRGIUS: No. Even if I did, I couldn't.\nCLEON: So you'd rather just watch the Slaughter Of Athens? A good story for your holiday? Tourists!\nTYRGIUS: Why not just make peace with them?\nCLEON: Peace with the Spartans? Never!\nTYRGIUS: Arg... I think you've broken something.\nCLEON: (STRIKES AGAIN) You won't help me?\nTYRGIUS: (pain) I can't. I'm sorry.\nCLEON: You're not the only alien in Athens. But you can be a warning to the others. Guards! Break him, like I'll break the lot of them.\nTYRGIUS: Something's wrong. No please, don't!\nMERGING: INTO THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE. AND A TERRIBLE BUZZING.\nCLEON: (whimpering) The sounds of war... they won't stop. My Fury, leave me alone!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. GREEK STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: CHICKEN. SANDY PAVEMENT.\nHECTOR: You made that thing up, didn't you? About there being something odd in the theatre?\nTHE DOCTOR: Perhaps. Athens... this city's not really the place for Ace. Not at the moment. Now Mel, she fitted in. She corrected Euclid's\nTHE DOCTOR: geometry. (PAUSE) Well, she fitted in. Apart from when she corrected Euclid's geometry.\nHECTOR: Is that what history's about? Fitting in?\nTHE DOCTOR: Not just that. It's about knowing what you can and can't interfere with.\nHECTOR: Plague of Zombies?\nTHE DOCTOR: Maybe.\nHECTOR: Flying beetles?\nTHE DOCTOR: Also maybe.\nHECTOR: But not the Spartans?\nTHE DOCTOR: No. They're part of history. Off limits. They're unstoppable - like Daleks with good hair.\nHECTOR: Really?\nTHE DOCTOR: All curls and ringlets. Remind me of Wham. Or do I mean One Direction? Is that more your era?\nHECTOR: Don't try so hard. So what's gonna happen when the Spartans rock up? They'll wipe the city out, won't they?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTOR MAKES AN AWKWARD NOISE\nHECTOR: So really, we're just wasting time with your mate Aristophanes when we could be saving lives?\nTHE DOCTOR: You think fighting's more important than art?\nHECTOR: Of course.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hex wouldn't.\nHECTOR: No?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to imply -\nHECTOR: Mr Perfect strikes again.\nTHE DOCTOR: (lying) Different.

The last night. Its people look out and they worry. For, somewhere out there, the Spartans are coming. And there's no stopping the Spartans, is there?\nACE: The Doctor and Hector, they're off solving mysteries and having adventures. And what of Ace? Well, she's just a girl. So she doesn't get to do anything. Because, girls. They're not important.\nACE: Only...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17.

She's got rights.\nSLAVE TRADER: No she hasn't.\nACE: Oh shaddup, I'll deal with you in a minute. (to LYSISTRATA) Hi.\nLYSISTRATA: Hello? Why are you helping —- (me?)\nACE: We're both women. We're as strong as they are, as clever as they are, and, let's face it, we look way better in a toga than they do. And, as I'm about to show you, we're great at fighting. Be right back. (TO TRADER) Where were we? Ah yes. Your teeth.\nSLAVE TRADER: What about them?\nACE: Oh look. I've invented dentistry. No, don't thank me. Now, are you going to hand me your keys?\nSLAVE TRADER: (PAIN) Who are you?\nACE: Germaine Greer. Keys.\nSLAVE TRADER: No. Why, you....\nACE: Thanks for the keys. Here you go... er, what's your name?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 31\nLYSISTRATA: Lysistrata.\nACE: Grab these keys, Lysistrata, fr the other slaves and scarper.\nLYSISTRATA: Thank you.

GREEK STREET\nHECTOR: These zombies are weird.\nTHE DOCTOR: And not mindless. That's not quite right. It's like they're... they're... waiting for a signal.\nHECTOR: Er, Doctor, I don't like the way they're coming towards us.\nTHE DOCTOR: Fascinating.\nHECTOR: Not creepy?\nTHE DOCTOR: (hesitates) Slightly creepy. But mostly fascinating.\nHECTOR: Have you ever seen a horror movie?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well no. Never had the time.\nTHE DOCTOR: How are you at running?\nHECTOR: Used to be the champion at sprinting from the Woolworths Pic N'!\nHECTOR: Mix.\nTHE DOCTOR: I miss that shop. (SIGHS) When I say run, run. Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. THE CELLS\nDIONYSOS: When madness spreads through the city, it normally means only one thing. A god has come to town.\nCLEON: You're no god.\nDIONYSOS: You think not, Cleon?\nCLEON: You're just another alien. I'll do to you what I did to all the others...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. CLEON'S PALACE.\nCLEON: So, you're the girl alien?\nACE: And you are?\nCLEON: I am Cleon, ruler of Athens.\nACE: Good for you. I'm Ace.\nCLEON: I'm not interested in your name. Only in that of your owner.\nACE: Owner? You really don't get women, do you?\nCLEON: I tolerate you aliens so long as you fit in. I can't have you giving women ideas. Whatever next? Will you be liberating furniture? Granting chickens the vote?\nACE: If women are so helpless, how come it’s taking three of your guards to hold me down?\nCLEON: (caught) I don’t have to answer to you.\nACE: You're not a leader - just a bully.\nCLEON: Girl, if you are so strong, will you help me save Athens?\nACE: Help you? Forget it, I’ve got better things to do with my time, boy.\nCLEON: Very well. You can’t say I didn’t give you a chance.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 36\nCLEON: Normally, we do this once a year. But you're lucky. I'm putting on an extra one-off performance. What happens is this. The people write down the name of someone they really can't stand on an ostraka (Oss- trar - car)- this bit of broken pot. Then the person with the most votes is ostracised from Athens. Handy way of getting rid of rivals. Did you say your name was Ace?\nCLEON: Congratulations, Ace. You're now banished from Athens.\nACE: What?\nCLEON: You wouldn't help me. So you're of no use to the city. Guards, throw her outside. Leave her to the mercy of the Spartans.\nACE: You can't! What about my friends!\nCLEON: T'll get to them. Oh, and one last thing - the Spartans have no mercy.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. GREEK STREET\nHECTOR: The zombies are gaining on us.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. (CALLS OUT) Help! Can anyone help?\nHECTOR: They've bolted their doors. The city doesn't want to know.\nTHE DOCTOR: This was supposed to be a fun trip into history.\nHECTOR: Does anything ever work out like you planned it?\nTHE DOCTOR: T'll get back to you on that.\nHECTOR: Er, Doctor, what is that?\nTHE DOCTOR: Umm.\nHECTOR: It's just - and I don't want to make a bad day worse - but it looks like a giant beetle.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes.\nHECTOR: I thought giant prawns were bad enough. But that's a giant beetle.\nTHE DOCTOR: You've said that.\nHECTOR: Flying towards us.\nTHE DOCTOR: You've left out the bit about its wings.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 38\nHECTOR: Yeah. They look like huge knives, don't they?\nTHE DOCTOR: That's because they are huge knives. RUN!\nTHE DOCTOR: THEM.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: EPISODE TWO SCENE 23.

It's just me. Standing my ground. Hello Death. Again.\nTYRGIUS: (WITH VOICE EFFECT) Hello. Sorry. I hope I didn't alarm you.\nHECTOR: Doctor, the beetle's speaking to me.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, yes it is. Hello, how do you do? I'm the Doctor.\nTYRGIUS: We've met.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh dear. Did I, um, by any chance thwart your invasion plans?\nTYRGIUS: Nope. We met about an hour ago. In the theatre. I'm Tyrgius.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh I see! You looked different.\nTYRGIUS: I was wearing my telegenic mask. Hold on.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 43\nTYRGIUS: (NO VOICE EFFECT) Better?\nHECTOR: Yeah. Much. Why weren't you wearing that just now?\nTYRGIUS: For flying? Wouldn't that not working as well as it Cleon earlier.\nTYRGIUS: have looked a bit odd? And besides, it's should. Not since my encounter with\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh.\nTYRGIUS: Well, with Cleon's fists, really. He doesn't like aliens. He explained this to me guite forcefully.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm fascinated by your mask - can I have a look? Ah yes - telepathic projector. Makes people see you as you want them to.\nTYRGIUS: The perfect disguise. Well, should be. If it was still working, but it keeps -\nHECTOR: Die! Die! Die! Stop it please! (RETCHING NOISE)\nTYRGIUS: (VOICE EFFECT BACK ON) . doing that. I'm sorry if that discomforted you.\nHECTOR: (shaken) No worries.\nTHE DOCTOR: (flustered) What was that?\nTYRGIUS: Subconscious buffer overrun. Picking up and amplifying the city's\nTYRGIUS: background fears. Dampening filter's been playing up for a while,\nTYRGIUS: but I think Cleon's heavies have finally broken it. Which could be quite, um, dangerous.\nTHE DOCTOR: Come back to the theatre and I'll take a look at it...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27. OUTSIDE ATHENS.\nACE: (narrating) Meanwhile, outside the city, a young woman was taking her exile nobly...\nACE: (distant, coming closer, muttering angrily) You know what you are, Athens? You're rubbish. You can keep your philosophy and your poems and your maths.\nACE: No wonder the Spartans have got it in for you - you're a bunch of snobby sexist slave traders run by a bully.\nACE: And, for another thing, it's really cold at night.\nACE: I could go on like this for hours.\nACE: Problem is, I've not got hours. If my luck holds, someone'll try and kill me in a minute. They'll have proper swords. What have I got? A rucksack. (THINKS) Oh...\nACE: That was close! Hello? Is that the Spartans? You hear me? My name's Ace, and... I'm not... afraid... of you...\nMOCKING: LAUGHTER ECHOES.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28. THE THEATRE\nARISTOPHANES: Doctor, there you are!

Remember him?\nARISTOPHANES: The pretty one?\nTYRGIUS: (STILL WITH VOICE EFFECT) Hello again.\nARISTOPHANES: You came amongst us disguised like Zeus on a romantic date?\nTYRGIUS: Well...\nHECTOR: Only his mask's on the blink. Here -\nARISTOPHANES: What a thing of beauty!\nTYRGIUS: Do you like it? I had it customised to look like a player's mask of Dionysos.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh yes! What does it do?\nHECTOR: If it was working, it could make people think whatever you wanted them to.\nARISTOPHANES: So, if I wore it, I could make people think my plays were actually funny?\nTYRGIUS: It has its limits.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 46\nTHE DOCTOR: Anyway, Tyrgius, we can't have you raising eyebrows. I'll just get some tools from my ship. Back in amo.\nHECTOR: So, Aristophanes, you're pretty cool about aliens visiting Athens?\nARISTOPHANES: You get used to it. In the old days, the Gods were always popping in for a feed and a ravish. Aliens? They're not so different.\nTYRGIUS: When you put it like that...\nARISTOPHANES: But a beetle! Dear sir, you are remarkable.\nTYRGIUS: Thank you.\nHECTOR: Mind you, what were you doing flying around at night?\nTYRGIUS: Visiting the plague victims.\nARISTOPHANES: There have been reports of a winged creature seen near them. It was thought it was one of the Furies hurrying their souls to Hades.\nTYRGIUS: No. Just me.\nHECTOR: Why?\nTYRGIUS: Busman's holiday. I'm a xenopsychosurgeon.\nHECTOR: A what now?\nARISTOPHANES: (patient) It's all Greek. Xeno = other, Psyche = spirit. Surgeon = good with his hands.\nTYRGIUS: I mend people.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 47\nHECTOR: Ah.

I knew he'd be behind it. You remember when h insulted Athens in front of visiting aliens?\nTELEPHUS: He was very rude about you, my Lord.\nCLEON: Oh, that wasn't important [IT WAS]. He brought the city into disrepute. No alternative but to prosecute. Couldn't get him for treason then, but this time I will. Telephus, get down to the theatre. I want Aristophanes' head on a plate.\nTELEPHUS: Before this year's performance?\nCLEON: Before breakfast. Go!\nCLEON: (musing) So, Aristophanes, you're behind my persecution? The dreams that won't stop... the killing? Do you really hate me that much?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30. THEATRE.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector - this mask is fascinating. The circuitry is a miracle of solid state micro-welding.\nHECTOR: (disinterested) Yeah, great. Where's Ace?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure she's around...\nHECTOR: Doctor, this is important. She's missing.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, yes, just finishing these repairs. With you in a minute.\nSUPE: .. 2.4\nARISTOPHANES: And then, turns out he's married his own daughter. Hilarious ending!\nTYRGIUS: Umm.\nARISTOPHANES: (coughs) Perhaps you had to be there.\nTYRGIUS: GROANS IN PAIN.\nHECTOR: Hey, are you all right, Tyrgius?\nTYRGIUS: Not really... My left brains hurt terribly. That mask can be quite tiring. And thanks to Cleon and his war, my services have been in demand. So many injured, so much pain.\nARISTOPHANES: The man is a monster, no offence. We grew up together. He was a nasty little boy.\nHECTOR: What's he like now?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 50\nARISTOPHANES: Still a nasty little boy. Is that fair?\nTYRGIUS: Perhaps I caught him on a bad day.\nARISTOPHANES: It's always a bad day with Cleon. He's filled Athens with cronies and spies - it’s because of him we're still at war with Sparta. He\nARISTOPHANES: doesn't want to lose face by ending it. As my play will demonstrate to the whole city.\nHECTOR: Right. Sure it will.\nARISTOPHANES: You don't sound convinced.\nHECTOR: Look, have either of you seen Ace? My friend? We left her her earlier.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh... her. Your slave girl.\nHECTOR: SPLUTTERS.\nARISTOPHANES: I sent her out to do some shopping. Told her to keep the change. (CONFIDENTIALLY) After all, the Doctor's paying.\nHECTOR: Where?\nARISTOPHANES: In the agora. Second left.\nHECTOR: Thanks.\nARISTOPHANES: Don't worry. She'll come back. Slave girls normally do. And, hey, if not, we'll buy you another one.\nHECTOR: Happy with the one I've got, cheers.\nARISTOPHANES: So, anyway, Tyrgius, we're an actor short.

Did I just see you come out of the Theatre of Dionysos?\nHECTOR: What of it?\nTELEPHUS: Is Aristophanes in there? Huge fan. I don't suppose... you have any spoilers about this year's comedy?\nHECTOR: You're a spy, aren't you?\nTELEPHUS: no.\nHECTOR: Come on.\nTELEPHUS: might be.\nHECTOR: Good. Then listen - my friend Ace has gone missing. You'd know what happened to her? She's a visitor. Young. Pretty. Not wearing a toga. Has your boss abducted her?\nTELEPHUS: I can assure you, my friend, I know nothing. She may well just have got lost. Athens is a large city.\nHECTOR: Exactly. And apparently you spies ar verywhere, so maybe you can ask around. Find her for me, eh?\nTELEPHUS: I would be only too happy to. I can put out the word right now. But, perhaps, in return....\nHECTOR: What do you want?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 53\nTELEPHUS: My boss, Cleon, you understand... he hates being mocked by Aristophanes. Every year. People can be so hurtful. He'd just like to know... in advance, what's planned. That's all. Not stop it - just brace himself.\nHECTOR: It so happens, I know a way you can find out.\nTELEPHUS: Do you?\nHECTOR: Yeah. Don't suppose you've ever fancied yourself as an actor?\nTELEPHUS: (thinks) My friend, the one thing actors have in common with spies - We both lie for a living.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. THEATRE STAGE.\nTYRGIUS: Oh dear. I'm not feeling too... [well]\nARISTOPHANES: (calling) Doctor! Your bug friend's passed out. I swear I didn't hit him with my shoe.\nTHE DOCTOR: (running) Tyrgius? Tyrgius... It's psychic shock. (MUTTERS) Something's badly wrong with that mask.\nHECTOR: Mister Aristophanes, I've- Oh.\nARISTOPHANES: Erm. It's just a prop for my play. Er, the hero flies to heaven on a giant beetle. Yes.\nTELEPHUS: (suspicious) A giant beetle? It's twitching.\nARISTOPHANES: All done with hidden wires. Marvellous prop. And you are?\nTELEPHUS: I'm an actor. Your friend Hector here told me you're looking for one.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh I am! My dear sir. How wonderful. Owe anyone money?\nTELEPHUS: No.\nARISTOPHANES: Ever been in a play by Euripides?\nTELEPHUS: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 55\nARISTOPHANES: You're hired. Come over here and I'll give you a script. I'vea costume for a Dancing Wine Flask that'll fit you like a glove.\nHECTOR: Is Tyrgius all right, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Even when he's not wearing it, that mask's still draining mental energy from him. I think this is a healing coma.\nHECTOR: Can you repair the mask?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, it's mended. Mostly. Works by rewriting the thoughts of anyone in the surrounding area. Fascinating really.\nHECTOR: Yeah, yeah. Can we find Ace now?\nTHE DOCTOR: What?!?\nHECTOR: Ace. She's gone missing.\nTHE DOCTOR: Why didn't you tell me? Wait, you did, didn't you, and I didn't pay any attention...\nHECTOR: Yeah.\nTHE DOCTOR: Sorry.\nHECTOR: Apparently she went to the Agora.\nARISTOPHANES: Hey presto, you're a singing jug of wine! Marvellous!\nTELEPHUS: Ummm...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33. THE AGORA.\nTHE DOCTOR: Excuse me!\nSLAVE TRADER: Yeah?\nHECTOR: Have you seen our friend Ace?\nSLAVE TRADER: Dressed a bit funny? Rude?\nHECTOR: Yeah.\nSLAVE TRADER: No. (SNIFFS) Unless....\nTHE DOCTOR: Here, noble trader, are some coins.\nSLAVE TRADER: Much obliged, sir. Your friend, was she called Germaine Gree?\nTHE DOCTOR AND HECTOR: Yes.\nSLAVE TRADER: Well, she had a look around, didn't buy anything. Went away. Peacefully.\nHECTOR: Anything more?\nSLAVE TRADER: No.\nTHE DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Hector.\nHECTOR: How did you do the thing with the coins?\nTHE DOCTOR: Produce them from my mouth?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 57\nHECTOR: Yeah. Neat trick.\nTHE DOCTOR: Not at all. It's where the Greeks keep their small change.\nHECTOR: Euw.\nTHE DOCTOR: They invented the coin before they invented the purse. Or the pocket. Imagine that - the Ancient Greeks have a term for The\nTHE DOCTOR: Ideological Sublime Of The Soul but nothing for Pocket Fluff.\nHECTOR: How do we find Ace?\nTHE DOCTOR: We'll ask the stock. Dealing in slaves is a filthy business. Doesn't encourage loyalty. (OUT LOUD) What a lovely looking dancing girl! (SOFT) Excuse me - can you help?\nLYSISTRATA: The girl you were asking about?\nHECTOR: Yes.\nLYSISTRATA: I saw her. She hit my master.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's Ace.\nHECTOR: What happened to her?\nLYSISTRATA: Guards came and took her away. It was quite a fight. It took three of them to hold her down.\nHECTOR: Definitely her.\nLYSISTRATA: I wish she'd come back and hit him again.\nHECTOR: We'll do our best.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 58\nHECTOR: Are we doing anything about them?\nTHE DOCTOR: The slaves? Vital part of the Athenian economy.\nHECTOR: It's disgusting.\nTHE DOCTOR: Comes back to bite them in the end.\nHECTOR: (dubious) So we just leave them to get beaten?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm afraid so. For the moment. Ace'll be before a jury tomorrow morning. There's nothing we can do until dawn.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34. THEATRE STAGE.\nTELEPHUS: (SLIGHT DISTANCE, ACTING) I say, I say, I say, what smells worse than a giant dung beetle? Cleon.\nARISTOPHANES: (APPLAUDING) Oh very good. Splendid. Doctor, Hector - there you are. Did you find your friend?\nHECTOR: She's in prison.\nARISTOPHANES: Never mind, eh? I say, thanks for finding Telephus - he's a marvel.\nTELEPHUS: Thank you.\nARISTOPHANES: A natural actor. Voices, misdirection, you name it. And he does such a good Cleon you'd think he was his best friend.\nHECTOR: Ummm.\nARISTOPHANES: My dear Telephus, with you in the cast, I may even win second prize. How about that? Provided, naturally, the Spartans don't get here first. Rotten sense of timing.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, they're not all that bad.\nHECTOR: (coughs) Let's talk about this later shall we?\nARISTOPHANES: Cleon just wants us to be afraid of them. Only thing keeping him in power. War makes him look good. Why, if we had peace, everyon would realise what a rubbish ruler he was.\nHECTOR: Er... he's not so evil, is he?\nARISTOPHANES: Oh no, he's the worst. Cowardly, callous, unhygienic. He probably eats babies for breakfast.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 60\nTELEPHUS: (sharp) Oh, really?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, his track record's not impressive. Since he came to power, tens of thousands of lives have been lost in a war with Sparta that he's needlessly prolonged through his incompetence.\nHECTOR: (hiss) Doctor, shut up!\nARISTOPHANES: You know, we had a chance to wipe out the Persians for good. He won a vote to go to war with them, and then spent the dosh on a war with Sparta instead.\nHECTOR: (MEANINGFULLY) Let's chat about this later.\nARISTOPHANES: While we've been squabbling with Sparta, the Persians and Macedonians (Mass-edough-knee-annes) have only got stronger. They'll be coming for us next, you mark my words. And the only people who could save us? Sparta. Fat chance of that. Thank you Cleon!\nTELEPHUS: Fascinating. (YAWNS) It's get a wine skin, but I really must\nTELEPHUS: ing late. I've really enjoyed being go to bed.\nTELEPHUS: ct ct\nARISTOPHANES: See you soon?\nTELEPHUS: (sinister) Oh yes. You certainly will.\nARISTOPHANES: & THE DOCTOR: Good night.\nHECTOR: \"Scuse me. Just going to say goodnight to him, outside.\nARISTOPHANES: Lovely fellow.\nTHE DOCTOR: (INNOCENT) Yes. And such a good listener.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. AGORA\nHECTOR: Telephus! Telephus! I made a mistake! Listen, I need to have a word! Damn. No sign of him.\nSLAVE TRADER: You again?\nHECTOR: Have you seen Telephus, the, er, spy?\nSLAVE TRADER: What's it to you... to you... to you... Dion... Dion... Die-Die- Dive\nHECTOR: Are you all right?\nLYSISTRATA: It's the sickness! He's got the plague. Quickly get the keys, free us.\nSLAVES: Help us!\nLYSISTRATA: Help us —- we don't want to get the plague.\nHECTOR: Sure, just give us a chance to find the keys...\nSLAVES: Help us.... help ussss... die. Die-Die-Di\nHECTOR: I'm too late. It's spreading.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36. CLEON'S PALACE\nCLEON: He! Said! What?!?!?\nTELEPHUS: That you eat babies. That you're a war criminal. That we should make peace with Sparta. It's all Free Speech, of course...\nCLEON: HISSES\nTELEPHUS: Only, my lord, he did make these treasonable statements on the stage of Dionysos.\nCLEON: So it was technically a public performance?\nTELEPHUS: Two outsiders were present. Alien outsiders.\nCLEON: Brilliant. Actual Treason.\nTELEPHUS: Yes.\nCLEON: He's always had it in for me. Ever since we were children. Just\nCLEON: because I was more popular than him. He was a name caller then,\nCLEON: and he's no different now. Typical writer - jealous of everyone\nCLEON: else's success. Well, I've nailed him now. Raid the theatr\nCLEON: bring 'em all here. Aristophanes can star in a tragedy. (LAUGHS) Oh, and Telephus, round up all the plague victims. Time to sweep the stables clean.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37. GREEK STREET\nLYSISTRATA: Please! Don't leave me here to die-die-die...\nHECTOR: Zombies who can snap iron. Great.\nHECTOR: Hey, guards! Am I glad to see you these people need your help.\nGUARD: Not from us, they don't.\nHECTOR: What?\nGUARD: Our orders are to round them all up. Cleon's new directive.\nHECTOR: And take them where? Hospital?\nGUARD: (shrugs) Drive them into the Theatre of Dionysos. And set fire to it.\nHECTOR: No. You can't! They're just sick, that's all.\nGUARD: Orders. The city must be kept pure. (TO GUARDS) Come on you lot, let's shift em.\nHECTOR: Right, Doctor. That's it. Enough about putting on your stupid play. This city's in a right mess. Someone's got to sort it out.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38. THE THEATRE\nTHE DOCTOR: (echo) Aristophanes? Hello?\nTELEPHUS: The Theatre's empty. He's gone, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Gone, Telephus? Gone where?\nTELEPHUS: Cleon's men came. They arrested him for treason.\nTHE DOCTOR: What? Nonsense!\nTELEPHUS: Page 64\nTELEPHUS: He and his co-conspirators were planning on betraying the city to\nTELEPHUS: Sparta.\nTHE DOCTOR: Really? Who said all this? Take me to Cleon! I'll set the record\nTHE DOCTOR: straight.\nTELEPHUS: Gladly. (WHISTLES) Guards!\nTHE DOCTOR: What? What are you doing -\nTELEPHUS: ) Iwas the one who told Cleon, Doctor. You see,\nTELEPHUS: I’m a spy.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh.\nTHE DOCTOR: I work for him.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39. CLEON'S PALACE\nARISTOPHANES: Cleon... do you really hate me this much?\nCLEON: The city hates you, not me. For your treachery.\nARISTOPHANES: I'm no traitor. I believe in Athens, in the amazing things this City has given the world. People come from the heavens to marvel at us.\nCLEON: You conspire with them all, don't you? You would have Sparta overrun us!\nARISTOPHANES: No! I just want an end to this war.\nCLEON: You think I don't?\nARISTOPHANES: No. You've let so many die... the people we grew up with.\nCLEON: That's war. You think this job's easy? You want to try it? Have my seat. Athens is yours. Go On!\nARISTOPHANES: (awkward)\nARISTOPHANES: T .don't... I'm not sure...\nCLEON: The great playwright, lost for words. Fine. Carry on writing your\nCLEON: nasty little plays. You've never achieved anything and you never will.\nARISTOPHANES: I've made people happy. The grieving, the frightened, the orphaned. I've made them laugh. (PAUSE) On a good day. (SIGHS)\nCLEON: You've done more than that. You sent a Fury to madden me! Haven't you?\nARISTOPHANES: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40. THEATRE OF DIONYSOS\nHECTOR: Doctor, are you around? Nah, the theatre's empty. No-one here but us chickens. And, yeah, one big sleeping beetle.\nHECTOR: Telephus!\nTELEPHUS: They've all gone, my friend. There's only you left.\nHECTOR: Is that so, “my friend”?\nTELEPHUS: Oh yes. I had them all rounded up. I've just been waiting for you.\nHECTOR: We have more important things to worry about. Can you hear that?\nTELEPHUS: What is that?\nHECTOR: Your man Cleon is driving the plague victims here. To slaughter them.\nTELEPHUS: Good riddance to them. They'll die... die-die-die. Oh no.\nHECTOR: Yeah. Not so funny now, is it?\nTELEPHUS: (shakes head) What's happening to me, my friend —- dion... dion... DIONYSOS. Help me.\nHECTOR: I can help you. But you've got to help me. Dionysos - that name you're all saying - tell me all you know about him.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 67\nTELEPHUS: Dionysos... Dionysos...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. CLEON'S PALACE\nCLEON: Somehow, Aristophanes, you're behind it all, aren't you?\nARISTOPHANES: I don't know what you're talking about.\nCLEON: You haunt my mind. Torturing me with waking dreams of battle. You sent that Fury after me.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh, you mean.... [that beetle]\nCLEON: So you do know. I thought at much.\nARISTOPHANES: I'm innocent. Why would I...[do that]?\nCLEON: You hate me. You want to drive me mad!\nARISTOPHANES: I don't! It's just... Oh, what's the use? You've never listened. Not since you were a boy. Never mind. (SIGHS) Show me to my cell.\nCLEON: Don't get too comfortable. The city may fall, but sure you and your alien friend are executed first.\nCLEON: T'll still make\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. THE THEATRE\nTELEPHUS: And then Dionysos... he... die-die-die...\nHECTOR: It's okay, my friend. You can go. You've told me enough. It's time to sort this mess out.\nHECTOR: Here they come.\nTELEPHUS: Die-die-die...\nZOMBIES: Die-Die-Die-Dion-Dion-Dion...\nHECTOR: Now, where's that mask? Come on Tyrgius, let's shift you.\nHECTOR: Aw, come on Doctor, where'd you leave that mask?\nZOMBIES: Diony-Diony-Diony-\nHECTOR: Got it! I hope the Doctor was right when he said he'd fixed it...\nZOMBIES: Dionysos! Dionysos! Dionysos!\nHECTOR: Please work. That's all. Save them. Here goes.\nDIONYSOS: Stay back. Stop and listen. Everyone. Stop and listen. (AS HECTOR) Yes. It's working. Like it's telling me what to say.\nZOMBIES: Tell us what to say!\nDIONYSOS: Dionysos is here. I'm Dionysos. The God of Fun. And that's just what we're going to have.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 70\nZOMBIES: Fun! Fun! Fun!\nDIONYSOS: Don't worry about the guards outside. Just relax, eh? Enjoy yourselves. If those guards try and come in... Dionysos says we're\nDIONYSOS: going to show them a good time.\nZOMBIE CHEERS: Dionysos! Dionysos! Dionysos!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. CLEON'S PALACE\nGUARD: Lord Cleon! Good news! The plague victims have been driven into the Temple of Dionysos.\nCLEON: And?\nGUARD: I'm afraid the god Dionysos himself has shown up to protect them.\nCLEON: What? Oh, it's just one of Aristophanes' actors. Wearing a mask and putting on a voice.\nGUARD: But my lord... It's a miracle - all the sick - they're now singing and dancing. They're his worshippers —- the Bacchae.\nCLEON: I don't care. Drag that impostor out of his theatre and throw him in a cell. He's no God. You'll see. But first, time to do something I'm really going to enjoy.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. THE RAMPARTS OF ATHENS\nCLEON: Good morning gentlemen. It's dawn. I love the view from the city walls. Out across Athens down to the sea. I trust you slept well.\nTHE DOCTOR: I've been in worse cells.\nARISTOPHANES: He spent most of the night talking to the rats.\nTHE DOCTOR: They were very friendly.\nCLEON: While you've been singing to vermin, I've been trying to save this city. And I think I've done it. Despite your treason.\nARISTOPHANES: Treason? We're innocent!\nCLEON: I've decided you're guilty.\nTHE DOCTOR: As any tyrant would.\nCLEON: I didn't bring you up here to admire the sunrise. I've decided to exile you. From the top of the city wall. Guards!\nCLEON: STRUGGLING.\nTHE DOCTOR: Cleon, why can't you believe that Aristophanes... he may not like you, but he's not plotting against you. I may be an alien, but I am most assuredly NOT WORKING WITH THE SPARTANS.\nGUARD: My lord! The Spartans are coming! They're marching on the city.\nCLEON: That damned racket. So it begins. Athens' darkest dawn.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 73\nTHE DOCTOR: Ask them if they've heard of me. They haven't. They don't know who I am. They don't care. And then, when we've cleared that up , I can help you.\nARISTOPHANES: He can you know, he's very good.\nCLEON: All right. I will ask them!\nADONIA: (helmeted, shouting) Cleon, Tyrant of Athens. Surrender in the Name of Sparta.\nCLEON: Spartan, do you see this man I'm about to throw off the wall?\nCLEON: Well, does anyone down there know him?\nMUFFLED SOLDIER: I do!\nTHE DOCTOR: Whu?\nCLEON: Really? Step forward, Spartan!\nACE: Hello Doctor! Don't worry. I've come to rescue you!\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh dear.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: EPISODE THREE SCENE 45. CLEON'S CELL\nDIONYSOS: So. We reach the dawn of the new God.\nCLEON: I don't have time for this. You've driven us all mad. I'm beset by traitors, and the Spartans are beating at the gates.\nDIONYSOS: Sounds like exactly the time for a god. If you ask me.\nCLEON: You? An expert?\nDIONYSOS: I am Dionysos —- I lead the dance. I bring freedom.\nCLEON: You're just a man in amask. One that I can take off, like-\nCLEON: My head! All I can see is death! Death and madness!\nDIONYSOS: It is unwise to lay hands on a god.\nCLEON: This is just some trick. An alien trick. To take my city from me.\nDIONYSOS: A city is not a city when it is held by one man.\nCLEON: I don't have to listen to you.\nDIONYSOS: (thunders) Yes you do! (SURPRISED PAUSE) No.... no, you don't.\nCLEON: In two minds?\nDIONYSOS: (shaken) Dunno what came over me... I.... Listen, mate, it's complicated...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 75\nCLEON: (mocking)\nCLEON: Do go on. “Dionysos”. If you really are a god, prove it by escaping this dungeon. Otherwise I'll burn your theatre down! You have an hour. In the meantime... I have nothing more to say to you.\nDIONYSOS: (mutters) I... (ASSERTING) I am Dionysos. I bring strength through joy.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: ANOTHER CELL\nARISTOPHANES: There goes Cleon. He doesn't seem very happy.\nTHE DOCTOR: Perhaps it's not much fun ruling Athens.\nARISTOPHANES: Nonsense! He lords it over all us. Did you see his face when the Spartans turned up and denounced you? Delighted.\nTHE DOCTOR: IT wouldn't say that. Although, I will admit their timing was rather unfortunate....\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. THE SPARTAN CAMP\nACE: (NARRATION) So, the story so far. I was captured by the Spartans. They made me fight for my life. I lost... and then...\nADONIA: (removes helmet, exertion) You fought well. For an Athenian.\nACE: (also tired) You're a Spartan? You're a Spartan woman?\nADONIA: We all are. Aren't we girls?\nACE: But I thought you were... I mean... blokes.\nADONIA: (laughs) Sparta does have women, you know. I am Adonia, Captain of Sparta.\nACE: And I'm Ace of Athens. Sort of. Why are you soldiers?\nADONIA: Because we're rubbish dancers. Seriously. All good Spartan girls dream of being a dancer. Sadly, not all of us make the grade - so\nADONIA: we have to join the boys at fighting.\nACE: But... isn't capturing Athens too important a job...[for women]?\nADONIA: Blimey, Ace you really are from Athens.\nACE: Sorry. I've just got so used to-\nADONIA: It's true what they say. The women of Athens don't think for themselves.\nACE: I don't actually like Athens very much. There was a whole being- thrown-out and having-rocks-chucked-at me thing.\nADONIA: Then, would you like to help us invade it?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 78\nACE: (narration coming back into the moment)\nACE: And since then, we've got on like a house of fire. Actually, we have set a fair few things on fire. Oh yeah, I like being a Spartan.\nACE: True, you Spartans aren't exactly Taste The Difference, but you're certainly a very good rough and ready meal. And at least you're honest. No tyrants, no philosophers, no slaves.\nADONIA: Isn't that right, comrades?\nMORE: CHEERING.\nACE: So, we march on Athens together. (CHEERS) To bring down a tyrant.\nADONIA: And who better than the Spartan Army? When you Athenians put on helmets you are playing a game of pretend. But when we put ona helmet we are warriors.\nACE: Come on ladies, let's go get em!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. A CELL.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRASH.\nARISTOPHANES: What the Zeus was that? It came from the cell next door.\nTHE DOCTOR: Something’s very wrong.\nHECTOR: Hello Doctor, Aristophanes. How's tricks?\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector, what are you doing here?\nHECTOR: (Change of subject) Fancy being rescued?\nARISTOPHANES: Very much so.\nTHE DOCTOR: Wait. It depends who by.\nHECTOR: Who do you think? Me, Hector.\nTHE DOCTOR: Were you being held hostage by Cleon as well?\nHECTOR: ..in a way.\nTHE DOCTOR: How did you escape? What's that behind your back?\nHECTOR: Nothing.\nTHE DOCTOR: Nothing looks like Tyrgius's mask.\nHECTOR: What's it to you?\nTHE DOCTOR: (sad) Oh; Hector}.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 80\nHECTOR: Do you want rescuing or not?\nARISTOPHANES: Stop questioning your friend and let him get us out.\nTHE DOCTOR: Not at that price. Hector, listen to me. Don't wear that mask. You don't know what it does, how it works, or what it costs.\nHECTOR: Then tell me.\nTHE DOCTOR: Your mind is still weak from the Swarm. You won't be able to control the mask. Give it to me, I’ll -\nHECTOR: No, Doctor. This city is in danger. Run by a madman! At war! Zombies everywhere... and what have you done? You could have done something about it. Instead you've just clowned around with Ben\nHECTOR: Elton here.\nTHE DOCTOR: Don't wear that mask. Being a god isn't worth the price.\nHECTOR: But I'll pay it. I'm just an ordinary guy, lost in history. I've no special powers. I'm not a hero like you. Maybe I can't control it. It's okay. I know it won't make me a god. But it'll make me a bit more like you. Like you should be. Someone who does\nHECTOR: something.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hex!\nHECTOR: REACTS TO THIS. A WINCE?\nTHE DOCTOR: (softer) Hector.\nDIONYSOS: Not Hector, Dionysos. I'm going to sort Athens out. And then, yeah, after that, you can put on your panto. See you around.\nARISTOPHANES: Well, I think you could have handled that better.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 81\nTHE DOCTOR: Shut up.\nARISTOPHANES: (BEAT) And who is Ben Elton?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. THE SPARTAN CAMP\nACE: Something's wrong with the dawn. The sun's not coming up.\nADONIA: There is something strange about this day. They say a new god walks their streets —- Dionysos.\nACE: What? Oh, I'm sick of gods. Who's this one?\nADONIA: A typical Athenian God - the lord of drunken stupidity.\nACE: Makes a change from being an evil from the dawn of time I suppose.\nADONIA: The people who once stood like living statues now run riot through the streets worshipping this new God. They are his Bacchae —- they have woven ivy through their hair and they sing and chant. Soon all of Athens will join in the dance. What of you, Ace of Athens? Do you wish to join in his jig?\nACE: No. Call me a killjoy if you like, but I think it's always fishy when Gods walk the streets.\nADONIA: Athens has welcomed all sorts for too long. Now their city is doomed.\nACE: But what about my friends?\nADONIA: It may well be too late. When gods come to call, there is one thing you can be sure of sooner or later they will demand a\nADONIA: sacrifice.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. CLEON'S PALACE\nCLEON: (to himself, on a balcony)\nCLEON: Look at them. running wild,\nCLEON: Too many for my soldiers to contro\nCLEON: Page 83\nCLEON: 1.

What are you doing here?\nDIONYSOS: You told me to come to you. If I escaped. Well,\nDIONYSOS: am here.\nCLEON: How? How did\nDIONYSOS: you get free?\nDIONYSOS: No prison can hold me. I am a god.\nCLEON: No, you're not. If you were —- you'd do something\nCLEON: out there in\nCLEON: the streets.\nDIONYSOS: That rabble are my Bacchae. They simply rites of Dionysos. Let me go to them. I can tame\nCLEON: and that lot\nDIONYSOS: Can you? The Spartans are coming in are clogging the streets.\nDIONYSOS: Tell you what, Cleon. You made a bargain with me\nDIONYSOS: bargain with\nDIONYSOS: you. I'll send the Bacchae back to\nDPONYSOS: 65 PL es\nCLEON: What do you want?\nCLEON: is this?

Did you do that?\nDIONYSOS: Yes. And I can do more. Let the ship of state coast for a bit. You're coming to a party.\nCLEON: (TEMPTED) Can you control the Bacchae?\nDIONYSOS: (silky) Of course. Come, walk in their shoes... walk in the steps of their God....\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. PRISON CELL\nARISTOPHANES: The people are calling for your friend Dionysos.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector isn't Dionysos. He isn't anything.\nARISTOPHANES: Cold.\nTHE DOCTOR: He's just a man. He shouldn't even be here, but Ace wanted him to come. She couldn't let him go, couldn't let him die. So he's here, now. A memento of someone better. Poor Hector.\nARISTOPHANES: He seems pretty sure of himself now that he's wearing that mask.\nTHE DOCTOR: His mind is still recovering from our last adventure. He's in no fit state to control the subconscious of the city. It'll eat him alive. He doesn't know what he's doing.\nARISTOPHANES: Do you?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes! Most of the time. Some of the time. When there's an R in the day. (COUGHS) I've handled this sort of thing quite successfully. But not Hector. He's never walked in history before. And he's not the sort to leave the past alone.\nARISTOPHANES: He's trying to save the city. You're being hard on him.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm being hard on ME. My mistake. Trips to other planets, trips to the future - oh, Hector could cope with those. But not his own past.\nARISTOPHANES: This is one of those things I'm never going to understand isn't it? Like when to avoid a joke about flatulence.\nTHE DOCTOR: Take a man into his future and they are not affected because it's not happened to them yet. But take him into history and they are, however indirectly, a product of it. He could be doing untold damage to whatever makes him Mr Hector Schofield.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 86\nARISTOPHANES: By prancing around in a toga with a mask on pretending to be the God Of Fun? We're Athens, relax. Anything goes with aliens.\nTHE DOCTOR: He's not an alien. He's a human. One whose very existence is...\nTHE DOCTOR: literally an Act of God. So the last thing he should do is pretend to be one.\nARISTOPHANES: Pity. He does it rather well.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. GREEK STREETS\nDOCTOR WHO: IS COMING!”\nCITIZEN: Save, us, someone, save us!\nCITIZEN: 2: My head... I can feel them in my head.\nCITIZEN: What?\nCITIZEN: 2: Die-Die-Die... Dionysos is coming.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. CLEON'S PALACE\nCLEON: Well, what do you think? Do I look like one of your Bacchae?\nDIONYSOS: Amazing.\nCLEON: It's not dignified. But if I must pass among them, if I am to understand the influence you have over them... and denounce you.\nDIONYSOS: Yes, to denounce me, that's exactly why you're doing it.\nCLEON: Do I look enough like a wandering madman?\nDIONYSOS: The ivy in your hair, it's a nice touch.\nCLEON: I thought so.\nDIONYSOS: Let me... let me arrange it for you better. See?\nCLEON: Marvellous! You truly have the touch of a God.\nDIONYSOS: Do I?\nCLEON: My head! As the city descends into chaos, my mind becomes clearer. I am free of my Fury!\nDIONYSOS: Good. Then, shall we go? Out into the streets of your city?\nCLEON: Oh no, of your city. Let us wander among the mad.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. GREEK STREET\nBACCHANTE: Dionysos! Dionysos is free!\nDIONYSOS: My people! As you can see, no prison can hold me.\nBACCHANTE: Celebrate!\nDIONYSOS: Oh all right then - but it's no good doing it here, blocking the streets.\nDIONYSOS: Have you forgotten there's a war on?\nBACCHANTE: It's all Cleon's fault!\nBACCHANTE: 2: You should have his head!\nDIONYSOS: Come, my Bacchae —- let's go to my Theatre. Let's clear the streets\nDIONYSOS: and have our revels there. Let's show Cleon how to party.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55. THE SPARTAN CAMP\nACE: Are they... are they having a party?\nADONIA: They say the people of Athens are mad. You would not catch us doing that in Sparta.\nACE: You don't have parties?\nADONIA: We... do. But they must be carefully planned and trained for.\nACE: Oh Sparta, you need to let your hair down.\nADONIA: My hair is the approved length and style. It is the people's haircut.\nACE: Good for it.\nADONIA: You would look better with shorter hair.\nACE: Thanks but no thanks.\nADONIA: Poor you. It must be terrible having no ambitions. I bet you c even read, can you?\nACE: I can read.\nADONIA: But still you don't know much. If it is a religious festival, we should not intrude.\nACE: That's no church service. They're having a knees-up.\nADONIA: A party. So?\nACE: Ladies of Sparta, I'm going to teach you how to gatecrash...\nACE: an't\nACE: then\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. THE PRISON CELL.\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah, have you come to release us?\nGUARD: No, citizen. We have come to put you on trial.\nGUARD: CORRIDOR.\nARISTOPHANES: Strictly speaking, of course, it's only me who you're putting on trial.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm more of a defending counsel.\nGUARD: Right....\nTHE DOCTOR: Could you, ah, give me the briefest refresher on Athenian Jurisprudence?\nARISTOPHANES: Really?\nTHE DOCTOR: I talked about it with Socrates once. I'm sure it'll come back to me.\nARISTOPHANES: We'll be brought before Cleon -\nGUARD: No you won't. He's done a bunk.\nARISTOPHANES: Ah. Then we'll be brought Athens. You remember that\nARISTOPHANES: before a jury of voting citizens of play of mine, The Wasps?\nTHE DOCTOR: Last year. Didn't win, didn't it?\nARISTOPHANES: No. But the joy I had poking fun at the jurors. Saying they were a bunch of old codgers -\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 92\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah.\nARISTOPHANES: Saying they were in the pay of Cleon!\nTHE DOCTOR: Uh-huh.\nARISTOPHANES: And that I don't know why he bothered corrupting them as they were all so miserable they found everyone guilty anyway.\nTHE DOCTOR: I see.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh, how the people laughed at them! And they had to sit there and take it. Ah, satire. I showed the old wasps. How they squirmed!\nTHE DOCTOR: Did they?\nGUARD: Here we are. (SMILES) They're waiting for you.\nARISTOPHANES: Anyway, point is —- make a good case and they'll give you a fair hearing.\nJUDGE: (distant) My noble jurors, called before you on a charge of treason is Aristophanes of Cydathenaus (Sigh-dath-een-ay-us) .\nARISTOPHANES: Tough crowd, tough crowd.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. THE THEATRE.\nCLEON: Amazing.\nDIONYSOS: You think so?\nCLEON: Yesterday... these people were all infirm or mad.\nCLEON: dancing in your theatre.\nDIONYSOS: I've cured them. Like I cured you.\nCLEON: But how? Alien magic?\nDIONYSOS: Perhaps I am a god.\nCLEON: It's not that.\nCLEON: I am.\nDIONYSOS: Come —- join in the dance.\nCLEON: I'm Cleon of Athens. I don't dance.\nDIONYSOS: It'll do you good to lose your head.\nDIONYSOS: (sinister)\nDIONYSOS: Page 93\nDIONYSOS: Today they're\nDIONYSOS: Still asking questions - why not just enjoy yourself?\nDIONYSOS: There goes Cleon, tyrant of Athens. Dancing. Not a care in the\nDIONYSOS: world. But who rules his city now?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. COURT.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hello Everybody! First of all, I won't keep you long.\nJURORS: SOME CHEERS\nTHE DOCTOR: My client is charged with betraying Athens, yes?\nJURORS: BOO\nTHE DOCTOR: And he's hurt you personally, has he not?\nJURORS: BOO\nTHE DOCTOR: He can be very cruel, can't he?\nJURORS: AGREE\nTHE DOCTOR: The audacity of the man, to put on a play in front of all of Athens, mocking you jurors?\nLONE VOICE: “Our eet*\nTHE DOCTOR: And when he did that, you were furious, weren't you?\nJURORS: AGREE\nTHE DOCTOR: You went home angry that night, you kicked your favourite chair, you went to sleep muttering. How dare he, how dare he?\nJURORS: MUTTER “True, true”\nTHE DOCTOR: And what did he call you - corrupt, vindictive old men, wasn't it?\nJURORS: LOUD BOOS\nTHE DOCTOR: Exactly. You're not, are you?\nJURORS: “No!”, “Outrageous!”\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 95\nTHE DOCTOR: Of course you're not. Wouldn't dream of suggesting it. But... I hate to say this... but perhaps some jurors were corrupt. And they went home that night and they never came back, did they?\nJURORS: - “thinking about it” murmurs.\nTHE DOCTOR: The result - the rotten apples were weeded out. So, reprehensible as my client's methods no doubt were - the outcome was for the good of Athens!\nJURORS: “ooh, he has a point” murmurs.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's all my client does. He is a surgeon - his satires may be blunt instruments, but his points are razor sharp. Where he finds a fault, he exposes it to laughter, and then banishes it. Athens is made better.\nJURORS: AGREE\nTHE DOCTOR: Perhaps a satirist should know when to sit down and shut up. But Aristophanes is on trial today for simply saying that this City is Sick of war. And you are, aren't you?\nJURORS: CHEER\nTHE DOCTOR: You've lost your families, your wealth and your crops.\nJURORS: AGREE\nTHE DOCTOR: Who wouldn't want an end to that? Especially, a little bird tells me, when peace with Sparta is in sight.\nJURORS: AGREE\nTHE DOCTOR: The war could be over. Your sons could come home.\nJURORS: HOORAY\nTHE DOCTOR: And Athens could be great again.\nJURORS: APPLAUD AND CHEER\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 96\nTHE DOCTOR: My client was simply saying that those who prolong this war are working against Athen’s best interests.\nJURORS: “And they are!” “Villains!”\nTHE DOCTOR: By doing so, he was using the thing that Athens hold vital - his freedom of speech.\nJURORS: Hear Hear!\nTHE DOCTOR: Would you have me take that freedom of speech away from him?\nJURORS: No! Shame on you!\nTHE DOCTOR: Then I shan't.\nJURORS: Hooray!\nTHE DOCTOR: He wants a strong Athens!\nJURORS: CHEER\nTHE DOCTOR: He wants a free Athens!\nJURORS: CHEER\nTHE DOCTOR: He wants an end to war!\nJURORS CHANT: “An end to war! An end to war!”\nTHE DOCTOR: I rest my case. Thank you.\nARISTOPHANES: (soft)\nARISTOPHANES: Of course, Doctor, you didn't say that what I really want is first prize.\nARISTOPHANES: THE DOCTOR MUTTERS\nARISTOPHANES: (serious) Doctor, well done. Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 97\nTHE DOCTOR: That was the easy bit. Now to actually save the City...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59. OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS\nACE: Right, pull up ladies. We're at the City Gates.\nADONIA: Are they... still having a party?\nACE: Sounds like it.\nADONIA: Shameful.\nACE: Oh, I dunno. Means it'll be easy for us to get in. Look - no guards on the walls.\nADONIA: The Long Walls of Athens have kept everyone at bay. They're impenetrable.\nACE: Yeah... about that. What's a party without a few fireworks?\nADONIA: Fireworks?\nACE: Riiiight. Not invented yet.\nACE: Here we go.\nADONIA: What is that silver flask? Are you pouring a libation in offering to the gods?\nACE: Not exactly.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 99\nACE: Thermos Flask. Thermodynamics.\nADONIA: Thermo....\nACE: Greek Fire. Stand back.\nADONIA: Ace, you blew up the gates! Amazing!\nACE: Yeah. Come on, we've got a party to join and my friends to save!\nADONIA: Spartans! Athens is ours! Put the Athenians to the slaughter!\nACE: (alarmed) What? Hang on, wait, wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. INSIDE THE THEATRE\nDIONYSOS: Cleon, mate, there you are. Having fun?\nCLEON: (despite himself) Yes.\nDIONYSOS: What do you think of the dance?\nCLEON: Truly ecstasy.\nDIONYSOS: Not lost your head?\nCLEON: Not yet.\nDIONYSOS: Another dance?\nCLEON: Later. Tell me, how do you do control them?\nHECTOR: It's a secret. But are you having fun?\nCLEON: For once in my life. Thank you. I owe that to you, Dionysos!\nBACCHAE: Dionysos! Dionysos! Dionysos!\nDIONYSOS: (over this) See? Even Cleon bows to Dionysos!\nBACCHAE: CHEER. “Cleon... Cleon... Cleon!”\nDIONYSOS: Gather round, Bacchae! Garland Cleon! Anoint him! For he's a jolly good fellow!\nDIONYSOS: DIONYSOS AND THE BACCHAE sing “For He's a jolly good fellow”. It starts out jubilant, but has a sinister edge as they close in on Cleon.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 101\nCHORUS: And so say all of us. And so say all of us.\nCLEON: Go on then. Do it.\nDIONYSOS: Do what?\nCLEON: You're a strong man - or haven't you the stomach for it?\nDIONYSOS: For what?\nCLEON: Don't make me laugh. I've a classical education. I know the story you theatre folk tell - how Dionysos took revenge on a tyrant who wouldn't worship him. Beguiled him, led him to the Bacchae... and\nCLEON: they tore him apart. That's what happens next, isn't it?\nDIONYSOS: That's... that the story, yeah.\nCLEON: Go on.\nDIONYSOS: Yes, it's time. (GROANS) No, I can't...\nCLEON: But you have to. You're a god, are you not? I'm a ruler who won't worship you. You can't let that challenge stand. Can you...?\nBACCHAE: (sinister) Blasphemy... must... be... punished...\nDIONYSOS: (weak) I forgive you. This time.\nCLEON: Not good enough.\nDIONYSOS: (desperate) I am a merciful god!\nBACCHAE: Show no mercy!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 102\nDIONYSOS: Shut up! Listen... (CRIES OUT) The mask! So many thoughts.... They hurt me when I won't do what they want...\nBACCHAE: Give! Us! Cleon!\nCLEON: You're no longer in control of your story. I'm at your mercy. Surrounded by your supporters. Eager to tear me limb from limb. After all, it's just one life. One life to bring peace to Athens. Isn't that right, Bacchae?\nBACCHAE: Kill Cleon! Kill Cleon!\nCLEON: Come on Dionysos. Don't stop them!\nDIONYSOS: (effort) No! That's the story, but I'm not a story. I can't do it.\nCLEON: A god would.\nDIONYSOS: (pain) I'm not... a god. Just an actor...\nCLEON: You're not even that. An actor wouldn't hesitate. He becomes the part. You're just a man.\nDIONYSOS: So? What if I am?\nCLEON: You don't deserve to wear that mask. That's the source of your power, isn't it?\nDIONYSOS: (Gasping) Stay back. Don't touch it - it hurt you before.\nCLEON: You wanted it to. I don't think it will hurt me now.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 103\nDIONYSOS: I'm warning you, mate, for your own good -\nCLEON: Thank you. Looks like the mask doesn't believe in you any more,\nCLEON: either.\nHECTOR: (agony) My eyes! I'm blind! What's happened to my eyes?\nCLEON: There. The mask fits perfectly. Ohhhhhh....\nBACCHAE: CLEON! CLEON! CLEON!\nCLEON: Thank you. For showing me how to control the city. I can feel it... my mind reaching out... Finally... I AM ATHENS.\nHECTOR: (weak) Stop it... Don't let the mask into your head! (CRIES OUT)\nCLEON: That's right Bacchae. Teach him that weak men shouldn't try and become gods. They haven't the (PAUSE) stomach for it.\nHECTOR: CRIES OUT.\nCLEON: But I have. Oh Athens, how beautiful, how strong you are now. Now that you're me. They said I wanted to be king... but I'm much better than that. I'm now a god.\nCLEON: HECTOR'S SCREAMS. BUT MOSTLY THE LAUGHTER. ECHOING ACROSS ATHENS.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: EPISODE FOUR. SCENE 61. THE THEATRE\nCLEON: Come — we'll make this city great again. They accused me of prolonging this war? Let's finish it.\nBACCHANTE: What about this man?\nCLEON: Is he still alive? (SHRUGS) leave him on the stage. We have more important things to do. Come.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. BENEATH THE CITY WALLS\nADONIA: Slaughter them!\nACE: Wait! Stop! You can't sack the city! That wasn't the plan!\nADONIA: We needed you. Who better than an Athenian to get us into Athens? And now we shall wipe it out!\nACE: No! You lying Spartan! You said you didn't lie!\nADONIA: I lied.\nADONIA: BUT, UNDERNEATH IT ALL...\nBACCHAE: (distant) Cleon! Cleon! Cleon!\nADONIA: Go on my girls! Crush them! You beauties!\nSPARTAN SOLDIER: (Distant)\nSPARTAN SOLDIER: There's a wall of them. We can't... get past them. It's like the whole city.... Too many -— no, keep back! (screams)\nBACCHAE: Cleon! Cleon! Cleon!\nADONIA: No!\nACE: What's going on?\nADONIA: They're tearing my troops apart.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 106\nACE: They're not even armed.\nADONIA: What is this?\nACE: Weird. And horrible. They're like zombies.\nADONIA: Witchcraft?\nACE: I don't know, but call your troops back.\nADONIA: Spartans do not retreat.\nACE: Then you're stupid as well as nasty. Look —- those aren't just soldiers, they're your friends.\nADONIA: (hesitates) You're right. This is a massacre. Oh, I should have been exposed at birth. (CALLS) Retreat. You heard me! Fall back!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63. TOP OF THE THEATRE\nARISTOPHANES: When they hauled me off, I thought I'd never see this old theatre again. Ah, I love the view down to the sea. Especially at dawn.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hasn't it been dawn for a while now?\nARISTOPHANES: Yes. Come to think of it.\nTHE DOCTOR: Psychic overflow impinging on the troposphere. Giving me a headache. Not good.\nARISTOPHANES: Should I be worried?\nTHE DOCTOR: There's a lot to be worried about.\nARISTOPHANES: It's peaceful. The streets wer mpty.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's one thing I'm worried about. Where is everyone?\nARISTOPHANES: PS is a (DEE “quer.\nDISTANT: GROAN.\nHECTOR: (weak, distant) Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: What was that?\nARISTOPHANES: Someone calling your name - those rags down on the stage?\nGROANING: HECTOR.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector! Oh, Mr Schofield...\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 108\nARISTOPHANES: What happened to him?\nTHE DOCTOR: What does it look like? His mind is probably in a worse state than his body.\nHECTOR: Help me...\nTHE DOCTOR: Who did this?\nHECTOR: Cleon... took the mask...\nTHE DOCTOR: He did what?!\nARISTOPHANES: Is that bad?\nTHE DOCTOR: Bad? A telegenic mask is being worn by a lunatic tyrant.\nARISTOPHANES: Cleon?\nTHE DOCTOR: Now has control over every mind in Athens.\nARISTOPHANES: But we're fine.\nTHE DOCTOR: And that's why I have a slight headache. Don't thank me for protecting you. Oh, Hector, I warned you! I said it would go badly.\nHECTOR: (agony) Someone had to do something... you wouldn't...\nTHE DOCTOR: This is not my fault! Why couldn't you trust me? I have done this before, you know.\nHECTOR: Didn't seem like it.\nTHE DOCTOR: Really? I've lived 900 years. I know how to take the long road.\nHECTOR: If you’re wanting an apology you’ll have a long wait.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 109\nTHE DOCTOR: Just for once, I'd like someone to understand how I work.\nHECTOR: COUGHS WEAKLY.\nTHE DOCTOR: Never mind. There's a time and a place. Aristophanes, help me get him up...\nTHE DOCTOR: We need to get him to that beetle. Quickly.\nARISTOPHANES: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: You heard.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64. GREEK STREET\nCLEON: That's right, my people! Throw yourselves on them! Crush them. Your lives don't matter. It's the numbers that count. We move as one, think as one, we're unbeatable!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65. OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES\nACE: Have you got your troops out?\nADONIA: Some are still in there. They're being torn apart.\nACE: Someone's not playing fair. Serves you right.\nADONIA: Few play fair on the dancing plain of Ares.\nACE: I don't know what's happened to the Athenians, but they're unstoppable.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. THE THEATRE\nTHE DOCTOR: You stupid beetle. Wake up! Hector's dying - I won't lose him again. I won't...\nARISTOPHANES: Doctor, your scarab friend is waking up.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hurry, Tyrgius... Hector's slipping away.\nTYRGIUS: (yawns) Whassa problem? Why've you woken me from my healing coma?\nTHE DOCTOR: My friend needs you, psychoxenosurgeon Tyrgius.\nTYRGIUS: Oh dear, he has been in the wars. What happened to him?\nTHE DOCTOR: He, ah, stole your mask.\nTYRGIUS: He what?\nTHE DOCTOR: (mutters) Took it, pretended to be a god, and now Cleon has stolen it.\nARISTOPHANES: Calm down. Don't get your wings in a twist.\nTYRGIUS: Hector had no right!\nTHE DOCTOR: No, he didn't. And neither did you.\nTYRGIUS: Sorry? How dare you!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 113\nTHE DOCTOR: Flying over the victims of the plague? How long have you been doing that?\nTYRGIUS: I hardly see how that's relevant.\nTHE DOCTOR: You've been trying to use your mask to cure them. Amplifying your natural healing talents.\nTYRGIUS: A few therapeutic thoughts, that's all...\nTHE DOCTOR: Making them susceptible to telepathic control. Causing a buffer overload.\nTYRGIUS: I was just trying to fit in. It's hard when you're a giant beetle. I was saving lives. Doing something for Athens. No, don't thank me.\nTHE DOCTOR: I don't have time for a sarcastic scarab. The plague is a terrible thing —- but that doesn't mean you can go around curing it. That's irresponsible.\nARISTOPHANES: What? Saving lives is irresponsible?\nTHE DOCTOR: Sorry, but it is. The plague is what happens to Athens. Set in stone. The population has to decrease in order for the state to make peace with Sparta. Otherwise the war you all hate so much will drag on for decades.\nARISTOPHANES: You make that sound so easy. It's taken so many people... friends... my family. And you say it HAS to happen?\nTHE DOCTOR: Fewer people die in the end. I hate the way the universe works, sometimes. Please. Help me save Hector. He shouldn't be here. Dying.\nTYRGIUS: I can heal him... But what about Athens?\nTHE DOCTOR: Let's start with the small things.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 114\nTYRGIUS: All right. Let me just... get the frequency right...\nTHE DOCTOR: You do that, I'll work out what I can possibly do next.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67. OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES\nCLEON: (distant, from the top of the City Walls) Can you hear me, Spartans? This is Cleon, God Of Athens!\nADONIA: The what now?\nCLEON: (distant)\nCLEON: I've let some of you live. Take a message. Athens fights as one. Every man, woman, child and slave. We are unbeatable. So run and hide while you still can. Because we're coming for you.\nADONIA: I don't believe it.\nACE: I do. When a man puts on a mask and says he's a superhero, it's never good news.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: THEATRE\nARISTOPHANES: (distant) Doctor, it looks like Cleon's taken control of Athens.\nTHE DOCTOR: Aristophanes, get me all the masks you have.\nARISTOPHANES: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: Raid the prop cupboard. Everything!\nARISTOPHANES: Some of it's not mine. Euripides will kill me.\nTHE DOCTOR: He won't notice. Hurry.\nARISTOPHANES: Can I ask why?\nTHE DOCTOR: Not until I've got some copper wire and done something clever.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69. OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES\nACE: (calling) Oi.... CLEON. You at home?\nCLEON: (battlements) Yes? Oh. You again.\nACE: Yes. Just a girl. Remember, you threw me outside?\nCLEON: How's that going?\nACE: Not so bad. Look at me. With the Spartan Army. And how's being a god?\nCLEON: Can't complain. Finally winning the war.\nACE: Yeah. With your horde of mindless slaves.\nCLEON: They are not mindless. They have my mind.\nACE: Mmmn. Same difference. You don't really do forward planning do you? Let me see, at your current form, it takes 10 of your lot to take out 1 of mine. How many thousands have you got? Just so I know how many hundred Spartans I need to order up.\nCLEON: T'll save you the effort - I'll reach out to your Spartans and....\nADONIA: C=c=c-Cleéon sees\nACE: Playing dirty? You're new at this, aren't you? Spartans! Fight back. Wherever you see him sneaking into your head, hit that thought. Hit it hard. It's what you Spartans are good at!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 118\nACE: That's taking more effort isn't it, Cleon? I guess, if you're giving everyone a piece of your mind, you’re spreading yourself a bit thin.\nCLEON: Shut up!\nACE: Adonia, the Athenians near the city gates they're staggering about. I've given you an advantage.\nADONIA: (weak) You...want us to attack again?\nACE: Yeah. Don't kill them.\nADONIA: Why not?\nACE: Because it’ll give him a bit more of his mind back. Knock them out.\nADONIA: Oh that's easy.\nACE: Go on, then. Give him Hades....\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70: THE THEATRE\nHECTOR: The battle sounds pretty bad.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. Feeling better?\nHECTOR: A little. (AWKWARD) Can I help?\nTHE DOCTOR: For a change, yes. Take this wire and these snips.\nARISTOPHANES: Here's all the masks I could lay my hands on.\nHECTOR: Who's this one?\nARISTOPHANES: Medea the child killer.\nHECTOR: Nice.\nARISTOPHANES: What do you want with them?\nTHE DOCTOR: Go to the top of the theatre. Where's the beetle?\nARISTOPHANES: Gone back to sleep - healing your friend's taken it out of him.\nTHE DOCTOR: Pity, I needed him.\nHECTOR: Another thing which is my fault, I suppose?\nTHE DOCTOR: It's not your day, is it? (PAUSE) Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 120\nHECTOR: The cheap seats? What's up there?\nARISTOPHANES: Well, there’s a nice view of the surrounding countryside.\nHECTOR: (BREATHLESS) Really?\nARISTOPHANES: Oh yes. Several thousand people coming our way planning on tearing us limb from limb. Quite the picture.\nHECTOR: Sorry about that.\nARISTOPHANES: Why did you have to choose Dionysos? Couldn't you have picked Hermes the Messenger? Then his followers would all have run away. But oh no, you had to pick the dancing murderers.\nHECTOR: Sorry. It just came into my head. Name of the theatre. And this chap told me a bit about him - that actor...\nTHE DOCTOR: Who?\nHECTOR: (lying) Can't remember.\nARISTOPHANES: Telephus!\nTHE DOCTOR: The spy?\nARISTOPHANES: Who you brought here!\nHECTOR: Alright! I just met him in the street. That's all.\nTHE DOCTOR: All?\nHECTOR: He said he could help find Ace, and I thought... what would be the harm? I'm sorry, okay?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 121\nTHE DOCTOR: (acid) Just don't drop those masks.\nARISTOPHANES: Here we are.\nTHE DOCTOR: Good. Now for some hurried welding. Since we haven't got Cleon's mask, I'm going to make a lot of the next best thing. With copper wire, and a few bits and bobs I got from my... caravan.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh, your TARDIS.\nTHE DOCTOR: (tightly) Yes. My caravan.\nHECTOR: That's enough to build more of Tyrgius's masks?\nTHE DOCTOR: The pound shop version. Let's get cracking.\nARISTOPHANES: My word, what a thyrsus!\nTHE DOCTOR: It's a sonic screwdriver.\nARISTOPHANES: Even the gods don't have one that lights up. I say, could I borrow that for my play?\nTHE DOCTOR: If we don't get a move on there won't be any play. Ever again.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71. OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES\nADONIA: Well done my sisters!\nACE: Yeah, drive them back!\nCLEON: (shouting) Bacchae, to the Theatre! Regroup!\nBACCHAE: Die! Die!

What do we do now?\nTHE DOCTOR: I want you to take this handful of Mettybelis crystals.\nARISTOPHANES: Mettebelis?\nTHE DOCTOR: Whatever. Take them and think. They'll form a memory patten that'll be reproduced by the wearer.\nARISTOPHANES: Think? Think about what?\nTHE DOCTOR: About... something that makes you smile. (PAUSE) Noo, not that. Something harmless.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh right. (LAUGHS) Yes. That'll do.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'll fit the crystals to the masks. Hector?\nHECTOR: Yes?\nTHE DOCTOR: As the Bacchae come towards us, put these masks on their heads.\nHECTOR: What? I don't much fancy-\nTHE DOCTOR: I don't care. Just do it!\nHECTOR: Right.\nARISTOPHANES: T'll help.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY\nHECTOR: Cheers.\nARISTOPHANES: They're coming....!\nHECTOR: (deep breath) Not again.\nARISTOPHANES: Page 124\nARISTOPHANES: IN.\nARISTOPHANES: Oh gods I don't really believe in,\nHECTOR: Right\nHECTOR: then.\nHEART: SUDDENLY, THE CROWD IS UPON HIM, UNDERWATER.

The complete works. Look at it!\nHECTOR: Oh... oh wow...\nARISTOPHANES: In any play, the chorus is the voice of reason.\nTHE DOCTOR: Our psychic wave is spreading through the crowd, across Athens. Countering all that rage and madness...\nARISTOPHANES: Tragedy dispersed by comedy?\nTHE DOCTOR: We may have a hit on our hands.\nARISTOPHANES: Blimey.\nHECTOR: Yeah, well, let’s not sit around waiting for the reviews, let's make some more masks, shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73: GREEK STREET\nCLEON: And this is for you, stupid girl.\nACE: Cleon! That's you all over. Beating up a woman?\nADONIA: Whereas I've got no qualms about beating up a man.\nACE: Adonia! You came back!\nADONIA: A few of us. To do what we can. Sacrificing ourselves against a mighty army.\nCLEON: A blood sacrifice. One I shall enjoy. Bacchae! Seize them! Rip them apart!\nBACCHAE: Bre--- brekekex...Brekekex Brekekex!

It's safe there.\nCLEON: Maybe safe for them, but not for you.\nCLEON: See this torch? If you're going to take my city from me, then maybe I don't want it any more. I'm going to burn it. Starting with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74: THEATRE\nARISTOPHANES: I don't believe it. Look at that!\nADONIA: Behold the might of Sparta. I've brought you an audience.\nHECTOR: Wow.\nTHE DOCTOR: This is excellent. Thank you, Sparta.\nTYRGIUS: Bring them closer. I can help...\nTHE DOCTOR: So you're awake, Tyrgius? About time.\nTYRGIUS: (groans)\nTYRGIUS: T'll do what I can.\nTHE DOCTOR: Capital.\nHECTOR: Where's Ace?\nADONIA: She's still fighting Cleon. Out there...\nHECTOR: (worried) Near all that smoke?\nTHE DOCTOR: Smoke? Did you say smoke?\nHECTOR: The city's on fire!\nHECTOR: I'm still the mask's primary power source. It's draining me...\nHECTOR: But\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75: GREEK STREET\nACE: Can't breathe... Cleon, you'll be burned too. Don't you care?\nCLEON: I have nothing left to care for. I have lost my city.\nACE: Then maybe it didn't mean that much to you in the first place.\nCLEON: They will remember me. If not as a god, then as the man who destroyed Athens.\nACE: Doctor! Hector... help....\nACE: What the hell's that?!?\nCLEON: No! It's my Winged Fury! I banished you! Keep away!\nACE: What is that? You know, don't you?\nCLEON: It haunts the battlefields. It's a demon.\nTYRGIUS: I'm a xenopsychosurgeon actually. Hello.\nACE: Hello.\nCLEON: Don't touch me again!\nTYRGIUS: Oh do shut up. You have something of mine. The mask. Give it to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 130\nCLEON: No.\nTYRGIUS: Then I shall take it from you. And you won't enjoy it.\nCLEON: SCREAMS AND FALLS AS THE MASK IS TORN OFF.\nTYRGIUS: Now to destroy it.\nTYRGIUS: That's better. You, girl?\nACE: Yes.\nTYRGIUS: Hop on my back. We're flying out of here. Get up. You on?\nACE: Just about. What about Cleon? Should we leave him?\nTYRGIUS: Oh, I suppose you’d better heave him up too.\nACE: Okay, he's aboard. What now?\nTYRGIUS: Find something to hold onto. Ow! Not that.\nACE: Sorry. The flames are getting close.\nTYRGIUS: Time to get out of here.\nACE: I've never done this before. Is it safe?\nTYRGIUS: No idea, I’ve never done it befor ither.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 131\nACE: Oh.\nACE: (worried) Can you go any higher?\nTYRGIUS: (grunts)\nTYRGIUS: You're both quite heavy. Don't look at the flames, look at the sky, look at the pretty sky. (GRUNTS) You know, I think the sun's coming up at last.\nACE: (REACTING TO WHOOSHING UP IN THE AIR) Woahhhh!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: THEATRE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GROUND\nARISTOPHANES: What the hell just happened?\nHECTOR: Everyone passed out.\nARISTOPHANES: Why?\nTHE DOCTOR: Dawn. The mask has been destroyed. The people of Athens are asleep. A few minutes' healing coma and they'll be right as rain.\nHECTOR: Even the ones who are supposed to be dead?\nTHE DOCTOR: Um. Tyrgius has cured them. Accidentally. That makes him not my favourite beetle.\nARISTOPHANES: What's that up in the sky? Is it a bird? Is it an astral plane?\nTHE DOCTOR AND HECTOR: It's Ace! On a beetle!\nACE: Woah! Incoming!\nACE: Thanks for the lift, mate.\nTYRGIUS: Don't mention it. I'll just have a lie down (BUZZ) Behind the stage... (BUZZ) Very tired.\nACE: Doctor, Hector! Long time no see. I've brought Cleon with me. Didn't drop him from a great height.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 133\nTHE DOCTOR: Good.\nACE: This is a right mess.\nHECTOR: It's my fault.\nACE: City in flames? Population unconscious? Ah, beginner's luck.\nHECTOR: Cheers.\nTHE DOCTOR: Help me drag Cleon to his seat...\nACE: Sure.\nHECTOR: Are any of them going to remember? When they wake up?\nTHE DOCTOR: Cleon will. I wonder how that'll play out...\nACE: What about the rest?\nARISTOPHANES: Waking up in a daze in the theatre? I'll just tell them they've slept through something by Euripides...\nHECTOR: And then what?\nARISTOPHANES: This, dear boy, is a theatre. Why not give them a play?\nACE AND HECTOR: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: That may not be a bad idea.\nDOCEOTK: as.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 134\nHECTOR: They're waking up! Are you sure about this?\nTHE DOCTOR: For want of a better idea, let's put the show on right here.\nARISTOPHANES: (calling) Citizens!\nCLEON: (waking) You! Traitors! What have you done?\nARISTOPHANES: Oh pipe down. Hello, Athens. Take your seats. Don't worry, the\nARISTOPHANES: tragedy is over. Now it's time for a comedy. You're in safe hands. I'm Aristophanes.\nARISTOPHANES: I’1l give you a couple of minutes to get properly awake, then we'll get started.\nTHE DOCTOR: (hisses) You know, I think we might be about to get away with it.\nADONIA: Greetings Athens. We're the Spartan Army.\nHECTOR: Oh dear.\nCLEON: Citizens, we're invaded!\nADONIA: Don't look so alarmed. We're no put out a fire. It's fine. Don'\nADONIA: staying.

Not palaces. Not temples. Voter's homes. Like yours and mine. Well, not yours, Cleon. You do live in a palace, after all.\nCLEON: People of Athens, seize them! Now! I order you!\nCLEON: Listen to me! My people, listen-\nARISTOPHANES: Sounds like your people want us to get on with the play. Perhaps, Spartans, you'd care to stay?\nARISTOPHANES: Oh, come on. Let's show the Spartans how to have fun, eh? For once in their lives!\nCLEON: What? Will you listen to this traitor? If you think I’m going to stay for this outrage...\nARISTOPHANES: Pity. If you go, you'll miss the jokes about you. Wouldn't want the people thinking you were a bad sport, now, would we?\nCLEON: I shall stay. A temporary truce is called.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 136\nARISTOPHANES: Ladies, take your seats! Come on people, budge up.\nADONIA: Very well. We shall... have fun.\nARISTOPHANES: Splendid! I'll just nip behind the Skene. You'll have to forgive\nARISTOPHANES: But, we'll improvis\nARISTOPHANES: give you a little play I'll call “Peace...’\nARISTOPHANES: the play.

For I am going to bring peace to this City.\nARISTOPHANES: CHEERS FROM THE CROWDS.\nARISTOPHANES: . and to Sparta!\nCLEON: (heckling) Come Aristophanes!

CLEON GASPS.\nACE: On that?\nARISTOPHANES: Why yes.\nACE: You're going to fly to heaven on a dung beetle? Someone's full of it.\nARISTOPHANES: Have a little faith, slave. Come Noble Pegasus! To heaven!\nARISTOPHANES: CREAKING.\nARISTOPHANES: To heaven!\nARISTOPHANES: (hissing) Tyrgius, wake up!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 139\nTYRGIUS: (sleepy) Whaaaaat?\nARISTOPHANES: My steed awakes! (LOUD WHISPER) Come on, flap flap!\nTYRGIUS: What? Oh no. Am I in one of your plays?\nARISTOPHANES: (SOFT) Yes. (LOUD) What's that Dung Beetle? You can't wait to fly me to Heaven to claim Peace?\nTYRGIUS: Dung beetle?!?\nARISTOPHANES: Giddy-up! And take care not to fly too close to the sun!\nTYRGIUS: I hate you.\nARISTOPHANES: Up! Up! And! Away!\nUNDER: THIS...\nCLEON: No! Gods, no! My Fury! (RUNNING IN TERROR) Get that horrible thing away from me!\nARISTOPHANES: (distant) See, Athens! See - Cleon flees at the very mention of the word\nARISTOPHANES: peace! Look! Look at him run!\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79: BEHIND THE SCENES\nACE: Well, thank Zeus that's over.\nLAST: LINES OF PLAY DISTANT.\nLAST: (“Oh! Peace, mighty queen, accept the sacrifices we offer you. Put an end to the words of war. Let the Greeks once more drink the cup of friendship.\nLAST: Blood cannot please Peace, so let us spill none upon her altar.\nARISTOPHANES: (coming in) That went very well. They'll have trouble topping that. No-one else has ever had a flying beetle befor\nTYRGIUS: Oh the indignity!\nARISTOPHANES: Lighten up, Pegasus. You stole the show. Didn't you have fun?\nTYRGIUS: . a little.\nARISTOPHANES: And did you see - when you took flight, Cleon scarpered!\nTYRGIUS: Ummm....\nTHE DOCTOR: Tyrgius - can I have a word?\nTYRGIUS: What about? I'm still very tired.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. It's about that.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80: OUTSIDE ATHENS\nNOISE: AS TYRGIUS FLIES IN\nCLEON: (ON THE GROUND) Stay back Fury! Haven't you done enough? Hounded me out of my city! Leave me alone!\nTHE DOCTOR: (on high, sat on Tyrgiush) Hello, Cleon.\nCLEON: Doctor! You're behind this!\nTHE DOCTOR: Leaving us so soon?\nCLEON: Are you Zeus, that you unleashed this Fury on me?\nTYRGIUS: Fury?\nTHE DOCTOR: The Furies only pursue those who've done something wrong... have you done something wrong, Cleon?\nCLEON: No!\nTHE DOCTOR: Sure?\nCLEON: Life's complicated. Not like one of your fables. I just tried my best. What do you want me to say, Doctor? It's the end of my tragedy, is that it? Before he goes into the wilderness, the defeated hero makes a big speech?\nTHE DOCTOR: (softly) I've had enough of speeches.\nCLEON: Then what? Your Fury's haunted my dreams ever since I fell in battle three months ago. I thought it was the end —- but I woke to find my wounds healed and this scarab hovering over me.\nTYRGIUS: Ah.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 142\nCLEON: And you've never left me!\nTHE DOCTOR: If you go now Cleon, I promise this Fury will follow you no more.\nCLEON: Fine. I leave Athens. To aliens and Spartans. I wonder how it will manage without me.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh it will. Good cities always survive their leaders. Goodbye, Cleon.\nTHE DOCTOR: THE DOCTOR AND TYRGIUS.\nTHE DOCTOR: Tyrgius, three months ago you saw Cleon wounded in battle, did you not?\nTYRGIUS: Yes. I simply went to see what the great Pelopennesian Wars (Pel- opp-en-ease-ian) were like... - so much blood and horror! - and suddenly, Cleon went down. I cured him without thinking.\nTHE DOCTOR: Cleon was supposed to die that day. That's what's been draining your strength, causing the problem with your mask —- you've not\nTHE DOCTOR: just been fighting his body, you've been fighting the universe.\nTYRGIUS: Now he's gone?\nTHE DOCTOR: Into exile. A peaceful, and probably short-lived retirement. So long as you keep away from him.\nTYRGIUS: I will.\nTHE DOCTOR: Your holiday is over, Tyrgius. Go home. And it's time I got back to the theatre. I believe Aristophanes has good news.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81: BEHIND THE SCENES\nARISTOPHANES: First prize! First prize! I've actually won! There shall be A PARTY to end all parties!!!\nACE: But wasn't there only the one play?\nHECTOR: Who cares?\nACE: Cheer up, Hector. One thing I've learned history's like a toddler. Beautiful and delicate, has a habit of bouncing back.\nHECTOR: History's not beautiful. War. Plague. Slavery. I tried to... I don't know what I tried to do. But we've done nothing except help\nHECTOR: the Doctor invent Chucklevision.\nACE: Is that what you think?\nADONIA: Ace! There you are!\nACE: Adonia! (to HECTOR) Hector, wait a mo, would you?\nHECTOR: Sure. I'll be over her\nACE: Adonia. How did you find the theatre?\nADONIA: I liked the dancing.\nACE: There wasn't much dancing.\nADONIA: I know.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 144\nACE: Oh.\nACE: So, what you going to do now?\nADONIA: Go back outside the walls. We did not win this City fairly. We shall attack again... (SMILES) Tomorrow. Tonight, we are going to\nADONIA: a party. We've been invited by those men over there. They have promised to introduce us to wine.\nACE: (looks) Wow. What! Are! They!?\nADONIA: Apparently they are Athletes. For Athenians they are not too puny.\nACE: You can say that again. Well, have a good time,\nADONIA: We intend to (SMILE). Goodbye Ace of Athens. It's been... fun.\nACE: Goodbye Adonia of Sparta.\nACE: Hector...?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82: AT THE TOP OF THE THEATRE.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hector! There you are.\nHECTOR: Déctor:. Hey.\nTHE DOCTOR: Lovely view from the top of the theatre. All of Athens.\nHECTOR: Is that all history is to you, Doctor? Nice views?\nTHE DOCTOR: Ouch.\nHECTOR: I messed up, sure. But...\nTHE DOCTOR: History's like life. It's complicated.\nHECTOR: You and Ace keep telling me what history's like. I just see people who need helping. And I tried.\nTHE DOCTOR: Didn’t really work out, though.\nHECTOR: No. (SARCASTIC) But hey, at least you put on your panto.\nTHE DOCTOR: Silly fun, wasn't it? Yet, it's quite famous, you know.\nHECTOR: Seriously?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh yes. A man flies into heaven on a beetle in search of peace. Just the play a man exhausted by decades of war, death and plague would write. Silly fun.\nHECTOR: Still, it won.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 146\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. A play performed in front of the entire city. Who voted for it to win. Athens just voted for Peace. And a fortnight from now.. the war between Athens and Sparta will be over.\nHECTOR: Wait. Doctor.... Was that your plan all along?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, I'd like to think I've helped. Call it a hobby. Backing Aristophanes' plays when no-one else would.\nHECTOR: You cunning old fox.\nTHE DOCTOR: Just doing my bit. His one about The Birds is lovely. Set ina place called Cloud Cuckoo Land.\nACE: Hey, you two. You're missing quite a party. Those Spartans really can dance.\nHECTOR: Afraid I'm not in a party mood.\nACE: The old Hex was a champion sulker too, you know.\nDOCTOR: (warning) Ace...\nACE: What? You're not the same, Hector Schofield, but you try your best.\nHECTOR: (bitter) Cheers.\nACE: Don't sweat it. History's back on the right track. Isn't it?\nTHE DOCTOR: (considering)\nTHE DOCTOR: Well... over in Macedonia (Mass-ee-dough-knee-a), a King is right now looking for a tutor for his son. He'll pick an Athenian called Aristotle, and his pupil will be so impressed by him he won't wipe out the Greeks. He'll enslave them, but he won't wipe them out.\nACE: Huh?\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 147\nTHE DOCTOR: Aristotle's pupil is Alexander the Great. He's still a fan of Greek Theatre. When he grows up. And conquers the world.\nHECTOR: So you're saying that's how history's supposed to go?\nACE: Aren't the details now a bit wrong?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well yes, but I'll just nip forward and edit Wikipedia.\nACE: Oh. (LAUGHS)\nHECTOR: And that's it, isn't it, for the two of you? Death and bloodshed and empires —- it's all FUNNY.\nACE: Hey!\nTHE DOCTOR: No...\nHECTOR: Forgive me, I don't get the jok\nACE: Hex would have.\nHECTOR: Yeah. You keep banging on about how much better than me he was.\nTHE DOCTOR: No-\nHECTOR: Oh, you do. Trust me. Look at you both - laughing and dancing as empires fall. It's funny for you. Well, you can keep your jokes.\nACE: That's not fair.\nHECTOR: Would Hex have stood here laughing? If that's what a hero is, then I'm glad I'm not one. Sorry I saw people dying and tried to stop it. So, I messed up. Fine. I quit.\nDOCTOR WHO: MASK OF TRAGEDY Page 148\nACE: Hector -\nHECTOR: You heard. Take me home.\nHECTOR: END"
