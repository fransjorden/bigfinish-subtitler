The Doctor and his young companion accompanied us upon our return to Constantinople, seeking another of their party from whom they had become separated, and on their arrival embroiled me in a most peculiar scheme to replace the Medusa heads at the bases of two columns in the Basilica Cistern — which had, unaccountably, vanished — with two identical heads.

It’s, er... very good to see you.\nSTEVEN: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m... the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: STEVEN/VICKI: The Doctor! ?\nDOCTOR: WHO THEME\nDOCTOR: Quite so: the Doctor.\nSTEVEN: No you’re not.\nDOCTOR: I realise, I do look different -\nVICKI: You’re not joking.\nSTEVEN: They’re right outside the TARDIS!\nVICKI: That’s all we need!\nDOCTOR: Who are ‘they’, might one ask?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 4\nSTEVEN: The Antoim.\nVICKI: Great round things covered in spikes — they float and smother and kill people! Ugh.\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST NOSTALGIC) Oh yes.\nSTEVEN: We’ve got to get out of here.\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course.\nVICKI: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Getting us out of here.\nVICKI: But we can’t leave the Doctor behind.\nDOCTOR: We’re not leaving the Doctor behind.\nSTEVEN: What are you doing with the controls? Only the Doctor can —\nDOCTOR: You were saying?\nSTEVEN: How did you do that?\nVICKI: Maybe... he is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I am. It’s... difficult to explain. For some reason, I appear to have suddenly switched places with the Doctor you know. I’m the Doctor - the same Doctor - but from a different point in my life.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 5\nSTEVEN: So you’re.. a younger version of the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: In a sense.\nVICKI: (TO STEVEN) I suppose he could be.\nSTEVEN: But if you’re younger than our Doctor, you wouldn’t know who we are.. and yet when we came in, you used our names.\nDOCTOR: Of course I know who you are: Steven and Vicki. (EXPLAINS) You see, I’m a younger version, but I’m actually older.\nVICKI: Do you age backwards or something?\nDOCTOR: To an extent. Look, Vicki — only the Doctor would know about the chat we had when we first met, yes? When I told you to give Barbara another chance after she shot Sandy.\nSTEVEN: Sandy?\nVICKI: My pet sand beast.\nSTEVEN: Your pet wh-?\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) And how we travelled to Rome together, and how that assassin attacked us at the tavern.\nSTEVEN: Assass-?\nVICKI: (LAUGHS) And you threw him out of the window, and I couldn’t stop laughing!\nSTEVEN: (UNDER HIS BREATH) It doesn’t sound that funny.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 6\nDOCTOR: And if we’ve just had a brush with the Antoim.. (CASTS HIS MIND BACK) Aha, yes! We helped the colonists escape, and my plan to put a stop to the Antoim didn’t work, so we decided to just run away and leave them on a deserted planet.\nSTEVEN: And they swore they’d track you down and destroy you.\nDOCTOR: I’d be surprised if they could find a way off that planet, never mind halfway across the galaxy. They’re remarkably stupid.\nVICKI: But why are you here instead of our Doctor? I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Neither do I. One moment I was in ‘my’ TARDIS, as it were; the next I was in... well, his. I mean yours.\nSTEVEN: How?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of temporal glitch, perhaps...? I might just switch back or...\nSTEVEN: ‘Or...’ ?\nDOCTOR: Or.. all this is rather less straightforward than I’d hoped.\nVICKI: We’re landing.\nDOCTOR: And I know where. I know exactly where.\nSTEVEN: Well that’s a first. The Doctor - our Doctor - never knows where we’re landing.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 7\nDOCTOR: I know because it’s already happened, to me. (F/X: AS\nMATERIALISATION: SEQUENCE CONCLUDES: ) When next I open those doors, we’ll be in the city of Ravenna near the northeast coast of Italy in the year 540 AD.\nDOCTOR: There, you see? On the scanner?\nSTEVEN: I’ll take your word for it.\nVICKI: (ADMONISHINGLY) Oh, Steven, buck up — it looks nice.\nDOCTOR: (UNCERTAIN) I suppose we should go outside.\nSTEVEN: You don’t sound too sure.\nDOCTOR: At this moment, I can remember how this whole journey turned out, because I’ve lived through it before. But as soon as I step out of the TARDIS, the timelines will change, it’1ll be me who does all this instead of your Doctor, and I won’t remember what happened first time around because it won’t have happened yet. If you see what I mean.\nSTEVEN: (BEAT) Yes, absolutely.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nSTEVEN: No.\nDOCTOR: It’s essential that I do everything as your Doctor would have done it. Anything else, and I'll have interfered with my own\nDOCTOR: timeline and... there could be severe consequences if that were to happen. Along the way I’1l try to work out what’s happened and how to bring your Doctor back. All right?\nVICKI: All right.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page\nSTEVEN: You definitely believe he’s the Doctor?\nVICKI: (BEAT) Yes. There’s just something... Doctorish about him.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take that as a compliment.\nSTEVEN: (RESIGNED) All right. Let’s go.\nCONTINUES INTO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 9\nVICKI: What’s so special about this place... Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ravenna? Well, it was once the capital city of the Western Roman Empire — until its collapse, of course.\nSTEVEN: Western Roman Empire?\nDOCTOR: Yes, the Empire became split, with a Eastern Empire ruled from Constantinople, often called the Byzantine (biZANtyne) Empire. But now, the Eastern Empire is the only Roman Empire still standing, and Ravenna is capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths.\nVICKI: Ostrowhats?\nDOCTOR: Ostrogoths. They occupy large parts of Italy at this time. This was supposed to be their great city, conceived as a rival to Constantinople or even Rome itself.\nSTEVEN: So what went wrong? The place looks half-finished. (HE KICKS OVER A PILE OF WOOD & RUBBLE.) Or half-begun.\nDOCTOR: We’re in the middle of the Gothic Wars. Ravenna is about to fall to the Romans, who are re-conquering Italy. Their army will march on the city at any moment.\nVICKI: Is it safe?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. As sieges go, it’s all quite low-key. — This way, I think.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 10\nPROCOPIUS: Belisarius, for the last time, I urge you not to go into the city personally.\nBELISARIUS: (WINCING SLIGHTLY AS THE STRAPS ARE TIGHTENING) The whole point of going into Ravenna is to make them think I’m going to accept their offer, Procopius. I can’t send someone else to accept on my behalf.\nPROCOPIUS: At least take more than just a small complement of household troops.\nBELISARIUS: I don’t want it to look like I’m invading.\nPROCOPIUS: But you are invading.\nBELISARIUS: Which is why it’s important that it doesn’t look that way. Tighter across the chest.\nPROCOPIUS: (PULLING ON THE CHEST STRAPS) You’1l be vastly outnumbered in there.\nBELISARIUS: We.\nPROCOPIUS: What?\nBELISARIUS: We'll be vastly outnumbered in there. You’re coming too.\nPROCOPIUS: (STOPS ASSISTING WITH THE ARMOUR) Me? Why?\nBELISARIUS: You're my secretary and legal advisor. If I was going in to negotiate a transfer of power, you’re the first person I'd bring.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 11\nPROCOPIUS: I’m not sure that I’1l be [of any —]\nBELISARIUS: You’re coming. Now where’s my sword..? (FINDING IT) Aha!\nPROCOPIUS: All right — but please, at least bring a medic with you. Just in case you’re beset by an assassin, [or —]\nBELISARIUS: (TYING ON HIS SWORD BELT) All right, bring Quintus. But it’s perfectly safe.\nPROCOPIUS: How can you be sure?\nBELISARIUS: (FINISHING HIS ARMOUR) They’re willing to make me Western Emperor, they have too much respect [to —]\nPROCOPIUS: A very generous offer. Which gives them ample reason to be angry when they find out you’re not actually going to take it.\nBELISARIUS: (NO MORE ARMOUR PREP) If they had any stomach for a fight they wouldn’t have made this offer at all. It’s my job to fight wars, Procopius, and it’s your job to deal with the paperwork. Come on.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 12\nPEOPLE: MILLING ABOUT.\nSTEVEN: Not a very lively place, is it?\nDOCTOR: Everyone’s on edge. Hoping it’1ll all be over soon. Which it Wail.\nVICKI: How did people live in these days? Never knowing if you’re going to be conquered and someone else is going to be in charge...\nDOCTOR: Hello — here he comes.\nSTEVEN: Who?\nDOCTOR: Belisarius. General of the Roman army. Already a legend, and he’s only just turned forty.\nCROSS TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 13\nGATHERED: AROUND.\nPROCOPIUS: (MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH) What happened to Quintus? He was at the back, wasn’t he?\nBELISARIUS: (QUIET) Eyes front, Procopius. (LOUDLY) All hail the emperor!\nPROCOPIUS: (LOW) Not many joining in with the ‘hails’, Belisarius.\nBELISARIUS: (LOW) They’ve let us in now — what choice do they have? (LOUDLY) Which way to the palace, Procopius?\nPROCOPIUS: (LOUDLY) That way, General.\nBELISARIUS: (LOUDLY) To the palace! Cheer, good people, cheer!\nCROSS BACK TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 14\nVICKI: (CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT) They’re cheering him on now.\nSTEVEN: I thought you said this was a siege?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) The Ostrogoths think he’s here to accept their offer to become Western Emperor.\nSTEVEN: (LOW) But he’s not?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) No. He’ll go the palace and declare that he’s conquered the city. Ravenna will have no choice but to surrender.\nVICKI: (STILL EXCITED) Shall we follow the crowd? See him enter the palace?\nSTEVEN: Are you sure that’s a good idea?\nDOCTOR: I told you, this is a bloodless siege. Belisarius just sort of batters them with his reputation, so he doesn’t even have to fight. I’d rather like to meet him.\nVICKI: You don’t have to come, Steven.\nSTEVEN: Shouldn’t we stay together?\nDOCTOR: True. Back in these days, my problems always seemed to begin with someone wandering off.\nVICKI: I want to go.\nSTEVEN: (WITH A SIGH) All right, we’ll all go. Come on.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 15\nSOPHIA: (SURPRISED & SLIGHTLY FLUSTERED) Quintus! What are you doing here?\nMONK: We agreed to meet here. Your message -\nSOPHIA: Yes, but aren’t you meant to be with Belisarius and the others? You can’t just sneak off.\nMONK: They’ve got other things to think about. This room’s a bit dingy, Sophia. How long have you been living here?\nSOPHIA: Since I arrived in Ravenna seven weeks ago.\nMONK: Was this really the best room you could find?\nSOPHIA: No, but you said we needed something with a high balcony.\nMONK: Oh yes, I did say that. Ah! Shutters, too!\nMONK: Perfect!\nSOPHIA: Why do we need a high balcony?\nMONK: Hmm? Oh, because there’s someone I want to find in the crowd. (SCANS THE CROWD BELOW) Three people, actually... And here they come now. See?\nSOPHIA: Who are they? They are dressed so strangely...\nMONK: She’s called Vicki, he’s the Doctor and that is Steven. And I came up here to tell you to protect them. With this.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 16\nSOPHIA: A crossbow?\nMONK: You can fire it, I’ve seen you. You’re very good. Positively Amazonian - only with a full complement of [you know whats].\nSOPHIA: (INTERRUPTING) It’s not very subtle though, is it?\nMONK: When have you ever known me to be subtle?\nSOPHIA: Fair point.\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 17\nBELISARIUS: Men of Ravenna! I demand your immediate surrender! — I am Flavius Belisarius of the Imperial Roman Army, and I take this city in the name of the Emperor Justinian!\nBELISARIUS: (EXHALES) Well, that’s the marching done. — Is there any wine in this palace? I’m parched.\nPROCOPIUS: Fetch wine for the General! (CLAPS HIS HANDS) Wine for the General at once!\nBELISARIUS: (LESS PUBLICLY) Procopius, tell the crowd outside what’s happened.\nPROCOPIUS: Why me?\nBELISARIUS: I need to stay in the palace until the handover of power is complete.\nPROCOPIUS: Can’t we both stay in the palace until the handover of power is complete?\nBELISARIUS: Tell them anyone who offers no resistance will be left in peace. We won’t loot their homes or defile their women, and we won’t set fire to anything. That should quieten them down. (A BEAT) — Go on, go!\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 18\nVICKI: I can’t see. Some walking rampart is blocking my view. Ow! (TO THE PERSON IN FRONT OF HER) That was my foot, clumsy! (TO THE DOCTOR, AS SHE NURSES HER FOOT) What’s happening now?\nDOCTOR: Someone’s coming out of the palace.\nPROCOPIUS: (DISTANT, TO CROWD) I bear a message from Flavius Belisarius.\nSTEVEN: He was with Belisarius when they came past us. Who is he?\nPROCOPIUS: He is returning the city of Ravenna to its rightful place as part of the true Roman Empire.\nCITIZEN: #1 Never!\nPROCOPIUS: And he pledges that all those who surrender without violence will be allowed to keep their wealth, their homes, and.. their families safe.\nCITIZEN: #1 No surrender! No surrender to the Roman invader!\nVICKI: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Vicki, things seem to be getting a little heated. How’s that foot of yours?\nVICKI: Recovering fast.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 19\nDOCTOR: Delighted to hear it. Steven?\nSTEVEN: Back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Yes, back to the TARDIS. Come on. (TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH CROWD) Excuse me. Please!\nCROSS TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 20\nMONK: Blast! Can you still see them, Sophia?\nSOPHIA: Just about, Quintus. Over to the right. They’re trying to get clear, but the crowd keeps closing around them.\nMONK: Getting rowdy out there, isn’t it?\nSOPHIA: I didn’t expect this.\nMONK: Expect the unexpected, my dear. I’1ll be needed down there — you just be ready to shoot if necessary. The Doctor isn’t supposed to die here... just make sure he doesn’t.\nCROSS BACK TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 21\nCROSS BACK TO: NOISE OF THE CROWD.\nVICKI: Steven? Steven! Doctor, I’ve can’t see Steven in the crowd!\nDOCTOR: Me neither. Let’s head back to the TARDIS and hopefully we’1l meet him there.\nVICKI: I thought you said this would go off peacefully?\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand. They should be accepting his terms.\nCITIZEN: #1 Coward! He’s betrayed us and you think we should roll over?\nDOCTOR: Good citizen — Belisarius has an army out there and men on the inside — you don’t stand a chance!\nCITIZEN: #1 What about our pride? We’re not going down without a fight.\nCITIZEN: #1 Starting with traitors like you.\nVICKI: Doctor!\nVICKI: IN THE CHEST. THE CROWD ON EITHER SIDE REACT.\nCITIZEN: #1 Time you accepted my terms, you trai- (CRIES OUT, FALLS BACK)\nVICKI: What on earth was that? What’s happened to him?\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINES HIM) He’s been shot with a crossbow bolt. He’s dead...!\nVICKI: Then there’s nothing we can do for him. Doctor, let’s go!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 22\nSTEVEN: Doctor? Vicki? Doctor! — Please, let me through — I need to find my friends...\nCITIZEN: #2 Oi! No need to push! What’s the hurry anyway?\nSTEVEN: I’m sorry, I just need to get through to my friends —\nCITIZEN: #2 What friends? Your Roman friends?\nSTEVEN: Don’t be stupid. Please!\nCITIZEN: #2 Oh — stupid, am I? I’11 show you who’s [PUNCHING] stupid!\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 23\nVICKI: Steven isn’t here.\nDOCTOR: Maybe he went inside the TARDIS to wait.\nVICKI: You’re the only one with a key.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Yes. You two should really have keys [of your —] Down!\nVICKI: (LOW) What?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) There’s someone hiding behind the TARDIS. I saw their shadow. (RAISING VOICE) Come out from behind the box and we won’t, er, hurt you.\nPROCOPIUS: Please. I’m not, I’m not armed, I’m not a soldier —\nVICKI: Hey, he’s the man who talked to the crowd.\nDOCTOR: So he is.\nPROCOPIUS: You’re Goths?\nVICKI: Goths? No, we're...\nDOCTOR: — just visiting the city. Who are you?\nPROCOPIUS: Me? Nobody.\nVICKI: Everybody’s somebody.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 24\nPROCOPIUS: Well I’m not. I’m just Belisarius’ legal adviser.\nDOCTOR: Procopius of Caesarea?!\nPROCOPIUS: (BEAT) How did you know that?\nDOCTOR: Author of ‘The Wars Of Justinian’, and ‘The Secret History’. It’s an honour to meet you!\nPROCOPIUS: I haven’t written any (hist—)\nDOCTOR: Not yet, but you’re thinking about it.\nPROCOPIUS: Yes, well, I mean I have accompanied Belisarius on several military excursions and I’ve made close-hand observations of — Look, who are you?\nVICKI: I’m Vicki, and this is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You were at the siege of Rome.\nPROCOPIUS: Ah yes, it was my privilege to witness —\nVICKI: Doctor! Shouldn’t we be looking for Steven?\nDOCTOR: Of course. We’ve been separated from our friend. You haven’t seen him, have you? Tall, dark-haired, square-jawed -\nPROCOPIUS: (INTERRUPTING) I don’t think you’1ll find anyone until the fighting’s calmed down. I tried to get back into the palace, but some of the crowd went for the doors. Cut me off.\nVICKI: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: You stay here, Vicki — I’1ll go out and look. Procopius can tell you all about the capture of Carthage. Back in a jiffy.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 25\nVICKI: (AFTER DOCTOR) He can tell me what about Carthage?\nPROCOPIUS: Ah. Well, if you want to know about Carthage you have to go back to the Battle of Ad Decimum (DEKKYm'm), ten miles from Carthage.\nVICKI: Right.\nPROCOPIUS: Unfortunately, Gelimer’s (GELLYmuh) intelligence was sound, and he had advance warning of the pending arrival of the Roman army...\nPROCOPIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 26\nPROCOPIUS: FADE IN & OUT, SWIMMING AROUND THE STEREOFIELD, SOMETIMES MUFFLED, SOMETIMES SHARP. THEY RESOLVE INTO STEVEN BEING SHAKEN\nAWAKE: BY THE MONK. STILL A BIT ROWDY OUTSIDE.\nMONK: Young man? Hello?\nSTEVEN: Whu...?\nMONK: Don’t worry, the worst of the fighting’s over. Are you all right?\nSTEVEN: (SHUDDERING, PAINED BREATH) Doctor. Find the Doctor.\nMONK: You’re in luck. It so happens that I’m a physician.\nSTEVEN: No.. different kind of Doc—\nMONK: Shh... save your strength. You’1ll need it.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 27\nPROCOPIUS: But then — the turning point of the battle: we slew Gelimer’s brother, thereby throwing the commander of the opposition forces into crisis and enabling us to regroup. We [then —]\nVICKI: (WITH RELIEF, HAVING BEEN BORED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Glad you’re still safe.\nPROCOPIUS: Yes, it’s all been quiet down here.\nVICKI: No sign of Steven?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. But the fighting’s calming down.\nVICKI: I’11 come and help you look, then.\nPROCOPIUS: But I haven’t even got to the taking of Carthage yet.\nDOCTOR: You can tell us later. Come on.\nPROCOPIUS: If your friend was caught up in the fighting, it’s possible he was mistaken for a Goth and taken prisoner.\nVICKI: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: If that was the case... (STOPS WALKING) perhaps I could speak to Belisarius?\nPROCOPIUS: Yes, I could get you an audience.\nDOCTOR: Vicki — can you keep looking for Steven while I deal with this?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 28\nVICKI: I suppose. After all, you’re the one who knows all about glad- handing historical figures.\nPROCOPIUS: Historical?\nDOCTOR: He’1ll be at the palace, I take it...?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 29\nSTEVEN: Wh-where are we going...?\nMONK: (GRUNTING WITH THE EFFORT) Don’t you worry, my young friend. I’1ll take care of you. You’ll see...\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 30\nMONK: BELISARIUS; THE DOOR IS ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY.\nPROCOPIUS: Belisarius...? Is this a good time?\nBELISARIUS: Yes, yes. Where have you been, Procopius?\nPROCOPIUS: I was cut off from the palace during the fighting.\nPROCOPIUS: This man helped me — he’s called the Doctor.\nBELISARIUS: Let him approach.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP TO BELISARIUS) General, hello. A friend of mine was caught in the upheaval, I’m trying to find him.\nBELISARIUS: Whose side was he on?\nDOCTOR: He wasn’t — we’re just visitors. But we wondered if perhaps he'd been mistaken for a Goth, and captured.\nBELISARIUS: If he was wearing clothes like yours, with your legs all covered like that, doubtless he was mistaken for a Goth.\nDOCTOR: Right.\nBELISARIUS: In which case, he’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Gone?\nBELISARIUS: Anyone involved in the resistance will be on their way to the coast by now. I ordered them to be put on a boat for Constantinople.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 31\nDOCTOR: You must get them to turn back.\nBELISARIUS: No, I’d need to send a rider and nobody can be spared whilst we're securing the city.\nDOCTOR: Then let me go.\nBELISARIUS: Nobody comes in or out except my men, until I say so.\nDOCTOR: But you must understand —\nBELISARIUS: And you must understand that I’m trying to rebuild the Roman Empire, and I’m afraid I consider that to be of greater importance.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 32\nVICKI: His name’s Steven. Steven Taylor. Dark hair, strange clothes?\nWOMAN: No, sorry.\nVICKI: All right — thank you anyway.\nSOPHIA: Excuse me — was this man wearing a sort of blue tunic? And black shoes?\nVICKI: Yes! Have you seen him?\nSOPHIA: He was being taken away with the injured.\nVICKI: Where are they now?\nSOPHIA: Bound for Constantinople.\nVICKI: Oh no...\nSOPHIA: Is he your betrothed?\nVICKI: No no.\nSOPHIA: Then why are you so keen to find him?\nVICKI: (BEAT) Yes, actually he is. It’s a secret. We eloped together.\nSOPHIA: How romantic. I shall shortly be travelling on to Constantinople myself. I could show you the way to the port, if you like...?\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 33\nVICKI: I'd be very grateful, ev...\nSOPHIA: Sophia.\nVICKI: I’m Vicki.\nVICKI: Is that where you’re from? Constantinople?\nSOPHIA: No no, I’m from Nikopolis (niCOPolis). Surely, you must have realised — you speak such good Greek.\nVICKI: Do I?\nSOPHIA: No need to be modest.\nVICKI: Why did you leave Greece?\nSOPHIA: Oh, they thought I was strange. I... did some strange things, it was better to leave. I couldn’t understand why I was different — but then a man, a stranger, came to my town. He talked to me, and explained why.\nVICKI: That was lucky. To find someone who understood.\nSOPHIA: Yes. Without him, I’d probably be dead...\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 34\nSTEVEN: (COMING ROUND) Whu... where...?\nMONK: Steady, my boy. Don’t try to get up.\nSTEVEN: What happened?\nMONK: There was fighting in the city. You were injured.\nSTEVEN: I remember getting hit on the head... ow!\nMONK: You’ve caught a blow from a sword across your chest. I’ve treated it as best I can... it seems to be healing well enough...\nSTEVEN: You pulled me out of the crowd. You saved my life. Who are you?\nMONK: My name is Quintus.\nSTEVEN: Thank you, Quintus. (BEAT) Wait — are we on a ship?\nMONK: Yes.\nSTEVEN: What? Why?\nMONK: Any Goths captured in the siege are being taken to Constantinople to join the Roman army and fight the Persian menace.\nSTEVEN: Oh no — I’m not a Goth.\nMONK: Oh. I thought you didn’t look like you were from round here.\nSTEVEN: I don’t even really know what one is. I was just visiting the Citys\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 35\nMONK: Odd time to visit, in the middle of a siege. How did you get in? Fall out of the sky?\nSTEVEN: Not exactly. But my friends — the people I was travelling with — they’re back there.\nMONK: I'm afraid it’s too late to turn back, but I’m sure I can sort this out with the captain. You’ll be a free man when we reach Constantinople...\nSTEVEN: But I’1ll be stranded there.\nMONK: Look on the bright side. At least you’1ll be stranded in the finest city in the world.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 36\nARE: POSITIONED WITH BELISARIUS & THE OTHERS APPROACH US.\nPROCOPIUS: (OFF) Belisarius! A message has arrived for you.\nDOCTOR: It’s from the Emperor Justinian.\nBELISARIUS: (SIGHS) Perhaps it’s a message of congratulations.\nPROCOPIUS: Er.. it has been only a matter of hours since you completed the occupation, so word of your victory won’t even reach him until\nDOCTOR: I think that was a joke, Procopius.\nDOCTOR: READS.\nBELISARIUS: What in the name of — ?\nPROCOPIUS: What’s it say?\nBELISARIUS: He wants us to return.\nPROCOPIUS: To Constantinople?\nBELISARIUS: With immediate effect. Angels defend us! The job here is only half done. If I leave now —\nPROCOPIUS: The Goths will encroach on the territory we’ve secured.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I think the Emperor’s concern might be [that —]\nBELISARIUS: Who asked you?\nDOCTOR: Nobody. Carry on.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 37\nPROCOPIUS: The Emperor says the armies in Persia are massing.\nBELISARIUS: They won’t mass as quickly as all that. Has he heard of the offer they made to me here?\nDOCTOR: He’1ll have been told, surely.\nBELISARIUS: He thought I’d take it. Faithless idiot.\nPROCOPIUS: And you weren’t tempted? At all?\nBELISARIUS: This is my life’s work! A thousand years from now, Roman Emperors will remember me as the one who made it all possible! The one who built the Empire back up when it was on its knees — after the feckless numbskulls who called themselves Emperors let Rome itself slip away from them!\nPROCOPIUS: We should prepare to return.\nBELISARIUS: Should we?\nPROCOPIUS: Well... the Emperor seems quite clear [that —]\nBELISARIUS: And I am quite clear that the conquest of Italy must be completed now and I would not let the gods themselves stand in the way of that, never mind the petty jealousies of a corrupt fool like Justinian.\nDOCTOR: General, if I could [just —]\nBELISARIUS: If you could what?\nDOCTOR: The Emperor is correct to be worried about the threat from Persia. I’ve, er, been there myself quite recently — and without you there to defend Constantinople, well...\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 38\nPROCOPIUS: It would be like cutting off the Empire’s head.\nDOCTOR: And clearly Justinian is already suspicious of your motives.\nBELISARIUS: Baseless suspicion.\nDOCTOR: Of course, but... if you don’t show him he’s mistaken now — how do you think he’1ll interpret it if you disobey him and stay in Italy?\nPROCOPIUS: That would be a disaster. The armies of the Empire fighting each other? The Persians would walk in and all would be lost.\nBELISARIUS: (BEAT) This is a mistake. But I’m not the one who has made it. (BEAT) Very well, prepare for our departure.\nDOCTOR: Procopius - would my friend and I be able to travel on with you to Constantinople?\nPROCOPIUS: Yes, I’m sure. Thank you, Doctor — for what you said.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t mention it.\nPROCOPIUS: He must obey the Emperor. However misguided it seems.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m afraid he must.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 39\nBELISARIUS: (CALLS) Hurry it up, men! A donkey could load a ship faster than you — I want to be ready to sail within the hour! (TO SELF) Every minute I spend here just reminds me of what I’m leaving behind.\nVICKI: Please, General — are you sure you can’t find room for it on the ship?\nBELISARIUS: No. It’s too large and too heavy.\nDOCTOR: But it’s very, very important to us.\nBELISARIUS: The wellbeing of my army is very, very important to me. It would take up valuable space needed for provisions.\nVICKI: Please —\nBELISARIUS: Be grateful I’m allowing you passage on my ship. I am not taking your enormous blue travelling chest as well.\nVICKI: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. It just means we’ll have to return to Ravenna after we find Steven.\nVICKI: If we find Steven.\nDOCTOR: Brave heart, Vicki.\nVICKI: It’s lucky the army’s turning back so soon.\nDOCTOR: For us, yes. Not such a good thing generally, though.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 40\nVICKI: Why not?\nDOCTOR: If he was allowed to stay here, Belisarius would have completed the conquest of Italy in a matter of months. While he’s away, there’1ll be skirmishes and land-grabs... and eventually he’1l come back and conquer it all over again. Many more lives lost, for no good reason. And I just helped that to happen.\nVICKI: You did?\nDOCTOR: Not because I wanted to get a lift to Constantinople, we’d have found another way if we needed to, but because —\nVICKI: That’s what was supposed to happen.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Otherwise, who knows, maybe the Roman Empire would still be around in your time.\nVICKI: Yes, maybe I’d be called Victorious.\nDOCTOR: Please, don’t joke.\nVICKI: You’re a lot more fretful than my Doctor, you know.\nDOCTOR: I assure you — I’m the same man.\nVICKI: I know, I know. But you are... different. In a strange way... you do seem older.\nDOCTOR: Really? I hope I’m wiser too.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 41\nVICKI: (DISTRACTED) Look! There’s Sophia.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nVICKI: The woman who showed me the way to the port. She must have a berth on the General’s ship, too...\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 42\nVICKI: WORLD. STEVEN WALKING, WITH THE MONK.\nMONK: Well, what do you think of Constantinople, Steven?\nSTEVEN: I can’t believe it’s so big, Quintus. Bigger than I was expecting. Amazing architecture...\nMONK: There has been a major programme of new public buildings, ever Since the Emperor Justinian came to power. — Is there anywhere\nMONK: I can take you, my boy?\nSTEVEN: I don’t know. I need to make passage back to Ravenna, but I’ve no money. I suppose I’1ll have to earn some.\nMONK: Well... they’re always looking for help down at the chariot races.\nSTEVEN: Really?\nMONK: If you’re feeling up to it. There’s a little job I have to do first... but if you meet me at the Hippodrome later, I can introduce you to my chum Yazid.\nSTEVEN: Hippodrome?\nMONK: Where the chariot races are.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 43\nDOCTOR: There it is, Vicki. Constantinople.\nVICKI: At last!\nDOCTOR: At this time, the largest city the world has ever seen. And most of it’s brand new.\nVICKI: So long as the land doesn’t sway from side to side. After days at sea, that’s all I care about.\nPROCOPIUS: Quite a greeting party down there on the docks.\nDOCTOR: They’1l have heard all about your success in Italy, Procopius.\nPROCOPIUS: (PLEASED) Do you think so?\nDOCTOR: Come on — let’s get ashore and we can start looking for —\nGUARD: (OFF) There he is! The blond one.\nVICKI: Now what’s all that about...?\nPROCOPIUS: Imperial guards. Doctor, I think they were waiting for you!\nDOCTOR: Me? But how —\nGUARD: You’re the Doctor, yes?\nGUARD: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 44\nDOCTOR: Not much point denying it.\nVICKI: Hey! Where are you taking him? (TO PROCOPIUS) Procopius, what’s this about?\nPROCOPIUS: I wish I knew.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Don’t worry, Vicki! I’1l think of something. I think.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 45\nSOME: CAGED BIRDS. THE MONK ENTERS.\nMONK: Emperor Justinian! Thank you for gracing me with your valuable time.\nJUSTINIAN: You are always welcome in our chambers, Quintus.\nMONK: I’m honoured.\nJUSTINIAN: You were right. The man you identified was aboard Belisarius’ ship.\nMONK: Excellent news.\nJUSTINIAN: I’ve had him arrested. You’re quite sure? This Doctor is a Persian spy?\nMONK: Very sure. What will you do with him?\nJUSTINIAN: Question him. Torture him, if necessary. Then put him to death.\nMONK: Very good, your Imperial majesty. Oh, yes. Very good indeed.\nMONK: END OF PART ONE\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 46\nMONK: 2: THE LAST ROMAN\nVICKI: General Belisarius, surely you can do something to help the Doctor?\nBELISARIUS: I’m far too busy here, unloading the ship.\nVICKI: Are they really accusing him of being a spy?\nPROCOPIUS: Apparently, yes.\nVICKI: Oh, Procopius — but it’s absurd!\nBELISARIUS: Don’t feel bad for being taken in by him, Vicki. These people are clever. They seem perfectly normal.\nVICKI: I’m sure they do, but the Doctor has never seemed ‘perfectly normal’ to me.\nPROCOPIUS: She has a point, Belisarius. Wouldn’t a spy try to be less conspicuous?\nBELISARIUS: Perhaps, it’s not my affair. The Emperor will decide. You’d better pray he’s in a good mood.\nVICKI: I want to know who’s accused him of this.\nPROCOPIUS: Why?\nVICKI: Maybe it’s a case of mistaken identity, but if not they must have a reason for wanting the Doctor arrested.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 47\nBELISARIUS: (SIGHS) I need to speak with the Emperor later about his so- called ‘strategy’ — I shall raise the matter with him then.\nVICKI: When will we go?\nBELISARIUS: First I need to leave instructions with — What do you mean, ‘we’?\nVICKI: Isn’t it better that I come with you instead of getting you to repeat it all to me later?\nBELISARIUS: (BEAT) All right, but you are not to speak.\nVICKI: Of course not.\nPROCOPIUS: I’m not needed, am I?\nBELISARIUS: No, I think this will be quite straightforward. I’1l tell the Emperor he’s wrong, he’1ll refuse to change his mind, and then if we haven’t killed each other, I’11 deal with Vicki’s business.\nPROCOPIUS: Good.\nVICKI: Why good?\nBELISARIUS: He doesn’t like going to the Palace, it might mean he had to talk to the Empress. (TO PROCOPIUS) She’s probably asleep anyway, Procopius, she usually is.\nVICKI: Why don’t you like her?\nPROCOPIUS: Because her soul is a cesspool.\nBELISARIUS: You just don’t trust yourself around beautiful women.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page\nPROCOPIUS: No man should trust himself around beautiful women.\nBELISARIUS: You’re a complex chap, aren’t you, Procopius?\nVICKI: Procopius... would you mind checking on the Doctor for me?\nPROCOPIUS: Well... I suppose —\nVICKI: I’d be very grateful. Just to make sure he’s being well treated.\nBELISARIUS: Oh, I’m sure they haven’t started torturing him yet.\nBELISARIUS: 48\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 49\nSTEVEN: So are these chariot races popular?\nMONK: Good grief, yes. The greatest action spectacle you’1ll see anywhere in the world today. Thrills. Drama. People getting trampled by horses. Fun for all the family.\nSTEVEN: It’s dangerous, then?\nMONK: Not where you’1ll be, I shouldn’t think. (CALLS) Yazid! — I’ve strong young man in need of hard manual labour. His name’s Steven.\nYAZID: (COMING OVER) Hmm. You a Blue or a Green?\nSTEVEN: A what?\nMONK: He’s not from Constantinople. (TO STEVEN) Blue and Green are the colours of the two chariot teams. Everyone in the city supports one or the other.\nYAZID: My family’s Blue going back three generations.\nSTEVEN: I’ll be Blue if you give me a job.\nYAZID: You worked with horses before?\nSTEVEN: I was hoping for something along more... mechanical lines.\nYAZID: We haven’t got anything along more mechanical lines. We got something along more ‘mucking out the stables’ lines.\nMONK: He’s bright, and willing to learn...\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 50\nYAZID: And willing to stink of horse dung?\nSTEVEN: (BEAT) Sure.\nYAZID: All right, all right — 1I’11 take him.\nSTEVEN: Thank you. I don’t suppose I could have an advance on my wages, could I?\nYAZID: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! No.\nSTEVEN: It’s just, I’ve nowhere to stay tonight and no money so —\nMONK: Don’t worry, don’t worry — I can give you a little money.\nSTEVEN: You’ve been so kind — I’1l pay you back. Thank you.\nMONK: No no, thank you.\nSTEVEN: What for?\nMONK: For your company on the voyage. I do get bored of talking to soldiers. I hope to see you again.\nSTEVEN: Yes, well — I’1l be here.\nYAZID: Here you go. One shovel.\nYAZID: Horses are over there.\nSTEVEN: Thanks.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 51\nSHUTTERED: WINDOWS. COOL. BELISARIUS AND VICKI AWAIT JUSTINIAN.\nVICKI: This is fancy.\nBELISARIUS: What else would you expect from an Emperor’s palace?\nVICKI: An Emperor. Where is he?\nBELISARIUS: He’s keeping me waiting to show me who’s in charge. Remember, girl, don’t speak unless the Emperor addresses you directly.\nVICKI: Yes, General, I get it.\nBELISARIUS: He’s a capricious man. Any little annoyance, any suspicion that he’s being manipulated or made a fool of, and he might decide to have the Doctor put to death. Or have you put to death. Or both.\nVICKI: Right.\nJUSTINIAN: (APPROACHING) Belisarius! Welcome home.\nBELISARIUS: Thank you, your majesty.\nJUSTINIAN: And we see you’ve bought us a present.\nVICKI: What?\nBELISARIUS: Ah. No, you see —\nJUSTINIAN: An Ostrogoth, is she? Is this how they’re dressing these days? How comical.\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 52\nBELISARIUS: No no — she’s not a present.\nJUSTINIAN: Perhaps we should be the judge of that.\nBELISARIUS: She’s the travelling companion of the man you arrested as a Persian spy earlier today.\nJUSTINIAN: Oh.\nBELISARIUS: She’s accompanied me here to make the case for his innocence.\nJUSTINIAN: Then she’s wasted her time. I’m not prepared to consider releasing him. (BEAT) Unless, of course, you were willing to surrender something in return...?\nVICKI: Like what?\nJUSTINIAN: Hmm... what could a lady such as yourself offer us...?\nVICKI: You mean..? — Well, of all the [cheek]\nBELISARIUS: (HURRIED INTERJECTION) Your majesty — if this Doctor is as dangerous as you suggest, surely he should not be allowed to go free on any grounds?\nJUSTINIAN: Are you questioning our judgement?\nBELISARIUS: I simply mean, the threat from Persia must be serious indeed, to justify my return from Italy — so in fact it is your judgement, not mine, that suggests he should not be let go.\nVICKI: Hey! I thought —\nJUSTINIAN: Be quiet. (TO BELISARIUS) Yes, the threat from Persia is a grave one.\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 53\nBELISARIUS: Of course it is. I’m sure your decision to abandon the Italian front was not taken lightly, but if this Persian menace is imminent —\nJUSTINIAN: It is.\nBELISARIUS: Then we must concentrate our resources here, and Italy will have to wait. Hopefully we shan’t lose Rome again.\nJUSTINIAN: Well, the faster you defeat the Persians, the faster you can get back there.\nBELISARIUS: Then there’s no time to waste. (TO VICKI) Come on, Vicki.\nVICKI: But you didn’t ask [him about —]\nBELISARIUS: Come on.\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 54\nBELISARIUS: STRIDES ALONG, VICKI HURRYING AFTER.\nBELISARIUS: Unbelievable.\nVICKI: Hey, that’s not what we [agreed —]\nBELISARIUS: The nerve of him, to act like this is all about Persia.\nSOPHIA: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Belisarius. Hello.\nBELISARIUS: Sophia. I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there.\nSOPHIA: No need to apologise.\nBELISARIUS: Are you waiting to see the Emperor?\nSOPHIA: Yes. Has your audience with him concluded so soon?\nVICKI: Sooner than I’d hoped, certainly.\nBELISARIUS: Yes, yes — he just wanted to offer his congratulations to my army for the conquests in Italy.\nSOPHIA: How nice of him.\nBELISARIUS: (RECEDING) Yes, wasn’t it. Vicki!\nVICKI: (TUTS) Coming.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 55\nBELISARIUS: He has heard about the deal they offered me at Ravenna. Of course the paranoid old fool thinks everyone’s out for power.\nVICKI: Yes, but —\nBELISARIUS: And then he has the nerve to consider releasing a Persian spy, right in front of me!\nVICKI: But wasn’t that what we wanted?\nBELISARIUS: It was what you wanted. The fate of your friend is not my problem.\nVICKI: But you don’t understand — if the Doctor doesn’t go free, then\nBELISARIUS: (STOPS) Then what? Does the weight of history rest on the Doctor’s shoulders?\nVICKI: Yes! Yes, it does!\nBELISARIUS: (LAUGHS) Come then, explain to me how this man nobody has heard of can be so important.\nVICKI: (PAUSE) Oh, you wouldn’t understand.\nBELISARIUS: I don’t blame you. A woman should think her man the most important person in the world. Come!\nBELISARIUS: HIM. WE REMAIN WHERE THEY STOPPED.\nVICKI: (RECEDING) No, it’s not like that. It’s not!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 56\nVICKI: THE MANACLES THE DOCTOR IS WEARING.\nDOCTOR: Thank you for coming to see me, Procopius.\nPROCOPIUS: Good of them to put you in the Palace cells.\nDOCTOR: One cell’s much like another, believe me.\nPROCOPIUS: These are a lot cleaner than the ones downtown.\nPROCOPIUS: And look, these leg manacles are on a nice long chain — I’ve seen ones where you can barely reach the opposite wall.\nGAOLER: Another visitor.\nVICKI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Vicki! Thank goodness.\nVICKI: They’ve got you chained up! Procopius — surely this isn’t necessary?\nDOCTOR: Never mind me — are you safe?\nPROCOPIUS: Belisarius is looking after her.\nVICKI: (GRUMBLING) Belisarius.\nPROCOPIUS: Did he put your case to the Emperor?\nPROCOPIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 57\nVICKI: No! He said he was going to, but before we even got to it, the Emperor said he might let the Doctor go anyway, and Belisarius ended up arguing against it! I’m sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Not your fault. It’s a little much to expect you to change an Emperor’s mind.\nVICKI: I still don’t understand — who told the Emperor you’re a spy? Nobody in Constantinople even knew we were coming here, but you were arrested straight off the boat — they even recognised you, and you’re not even supposed to look like this.\nPROCOPIUS: What do you mean, ‘Not supposed to [look —’]\nDOCTOR: I see what you mean, Vicki — a message must have been sent from Ravenna ahead of us.\nPROCOPIUS: Belisarius’ troops are loyal men, none of them would go over his head. They’d have reported their suspicions to him first.\nDOCTOR: Then who does that leave?\nVICKI: (BEAT) Sophia. I just saw her waiting to see the Emperor.\nPROCOPIUS: What did she want?\nVICKI: I was going to ask but Belisarius dragged me away. Not Sophia, surely? She seemed so nice...\nDOCTOR: What do we know about her?\nVICKI: She’s Greek... and she’s not married.\nDOCTOR: Why should she want to tell people I’m a spy?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 58\nVICKI: She’s still up there, talking to him. If I wait for her outside, I can catch her on her way out and maybe we can get some answers.\nPROCOPIUS: I’1l come with you. If this woman poses a threat to the security of the Empire, we need to know. (CALLS) Gaoler!\nDOCTOR: Be careful!\nPROCOPIUS: I will, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I was talking more to Vicki.\nPROCOPIUS: Oh.\nDOCTOR: But, er, you be careful too.\nPROCOPIUS: Yes. Thank you.\nVICKI: Come on, Procopius...\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 59\nYAZID: Haven’t you finished mucking out the horses yet?\nSTEPHEN: (STOPS; PANTING) Sorry. Slow going in this heat.\nSTEVEN: Are you all right?\nYAZID: Yes, yes — Where is Heraclius (hairRACKlius)?\nSTEVEN: He went home. (BEGINS SHOVELLING AGAIN)\nYAZID: What?\nSTEVEN: He’s not well. He could hardly breathe — there was no point having him here, he was just getting in the way.\nSTEVEN: You don’t sound too clever either.\nYAZID: I’ll be fine. I often get it when the wind kicks the dust up. Stop shovelling, that’s good enough.\nYAZID: Do you have any skill with a brush?\nSTEVEN: You want me to sweep up now?\nYAZID: A paintbrush. We’ve fitted three fresh wheels to chariots and if I don’t get them painted people at the other end of the Hippodrome won’t be able to tell one team from another. Can you do-it?\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 60\nSTEVEN: Of course.\nYAZID: Come with me and you can get started.\nSTEVEN: It’s getting late, I was going to go and look for somewhere to stay.\nYAZID: You can sleep in my office tonight, there’s blankets and so on in there.\nSTEVEN: Thanks. I think.\nYAZID: We need to make up for lost time. We’ve got a race tomorrow and we won’t be ready if people keep crying off at the slightest sniffle. (STARTS COUGHING AGAIN)\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 61\nPROCOPIUS: ARE WATCHING THE PALACE GATES.\nVICKI: Procopius-\nPROCOPIUS: Shh!\nVICKI: (HUSHED) Sorry. Procopius — is that gate the only way in and out of the palace?\nPROCOPIUS: It’s the only way Sophia would be allowed to leave, if that’s what you’re asking.\nVICKI: Just thought we might have missed her. She’s been in there a long time.\nPROCOPIUS: Perhaps the Emperor has taken a shine to her.\nVICKI: Ugh, yes. He tried it on with me.\nPROCOPIUS: And you rejected him?\nVICKI: Fortunately I didn’t have to. Belisarius intervened.\nPROCOPIUS: You could have gained a considerable advantage.\nVICKI: Thank you, but I’1ll find another way to help the Doctor.\nVICKI: (LOW) There she is.\nPROCOPIUS: (LOW) Shall we approach her together?\nVICKI: (LOW) No, wait. She hasn’t seen us... Let’s follow her, see where she goes.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 62\nPROCOPIUS: (LOW) Why?\nVICKI: (LOW) We might find out something she doesn’t want us to know.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 63\nJUSTINIAN: Ah! Theodora. It has been a singularly tedious day.\nTHEODORA: Tedious? Really, Justinian?\nJUSTINIAN: Deeply tedious, my love.\nTHEODORA: So the pretty young lady who arrived at the end of the afternoon — was she tedious, too?\nJUSTINIAN: Quintus said we should speak to her.\nTHEODORA: Oh, well if Quintus said so.\nJUSTINIAN: Quintus has been right about a great many things.\nTHEODORA: I’m sure it was a terrible chore.\nJUSTINIAN: You think I enjoy having a constant stream of people coming through my home? Considering the size of this palace, you’d think I might get a bit of peace and quiet occasionally.\nTHEODORA: What did she want?\nJUSTINIAN: She wanted to tell me about some prophecies from her native lands.\nTHEODORA: You don’t believe that sort of thing.\nJUSTINIAN: No, but it can be useful to know about them. Some of them were about me, or at least they might be about me, and if they come true -\nTHEODORA: Was I in them too?\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 64\nJUSTINIAN: A moment ago you didn’t even believe this girl had come to [me about —]\nTHEODORA: I was joking. You know my sense of humour.\nJUSTINIAN: Yes. You did figure in them, actually.\nTHEODORA: Oh good. Well. Unless they’re prophecies of my death.\nJUSTINIAN: If she’d told me that I would have had her executed for upsetting me.\nTHEODORA: That’s sweet of you.\nJUSTINIAN: It was all quite exciting. The restoration of the Empire. Permanently.\nTHEODORA: Ooh.\nJUSTINIAN: Harmony. Happiness. Stability. A peaceful future.\nTHEODORA: Really? Doesn’t sound your sort of thing, beloved.\nJUSTINIAN: What do you mean?\nTHEODORA: We don’t unite. We divide — and conquer.\nJUSTINIAN: Yes, it’s probably all rubbish.\nTHEODORA: A girl will say all manner of nonsense to get into an emperor’s chambers.\nJUSTINIAN: Did you?\nTHEODORA: I didn’t have to.\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 65\nVICKI: Where’s she going?\nPROCOPIUS: That’s the Basilica Cistern.\nVICKI: The what?\nPROCOPIUS: They only finished it quite recently. The Basilica was destroyed in the riots, you see, and —\nVICKI: But it’s not a house?\nPROCOPIUS: No no, of course it’s not a house. Whoever heard of a sunken house?\nVICKI: Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot, just tell me what it is.\nPROCOPIUS: Well it’s a cistern. It’s part of the water supply of the city.\nVICKI: Perhaps she’s thirsty.\nPROCOPIUS: There’s really nothing else. It’s just a huge space with a series of columns to hold the ceiling up, and periodically it fills with water.\nVICKI: Let’s go down.\nPROCOPIUS: Couldn’t we just wait out here?\nVICKI: I want to see what she’s doing. Come on!\nCONTINUES INTO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nCONTINUES INTO: Page 66\nHEARD: GOING ACROSS THE WATER. LOW VOICES UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.\nVICKI: Why’s she got a boat?\nPROCOPIUS: Shh! Voices carry down here.\nVICKI: Where is she going?\nPROCOPIUS: Aha! Perhaps she’s hidden something here.\nVICKI: Aaah. In the water?\nPROCOPIUS: Yes. Attached it to a weight of some kind and dropped it.\nPROCOPIUS: would be unlikely to be disturbed down here.\nVICKI: Let’s see what she brings up then.\nPROCOPIUS: I would prefer to —\nVICKI: She’s stopped the boat — look.\nSOPHIA: (LONG WAY OFF) Rynesh Quesh Ath Wentesh. Thyben Quesh Ash.\nPROCOPIUS: What’s she up to?\nVICKI: Reading words from a parchment.\nPROCOPIUS: It\nPROCOPIUS: . with a blue ribbon, I can see that. But what was she saying?\nPROCOPIUS: It’s no tongue I recognise.\nVICKI: Me neither.\nLOW: VOICES.\nLOW: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 67\nVICKI: The whole place is shaking. Is it an earthquake?\nPROCOPIUS: Something’s rising up from the water — look, next to her boat!\nPROCOPIUS: THE WATER. THE CHAMBER IS TREMBLING LIKE AT THE END OF ‘INDIANA\nJONES: & THE LAST CRUSADE’.\nVICKI: What’s happening?\nPROCOPIUS: It can’t be... That’s solid stone!\nVICKI: What is?\nPROCOPIUS: The columns that support the cistern were taken from other buildings, from many different places, and transported here. Two of them - those two, in fact - use as their bases giant stone heads carved with the face of Medusa. The builders thought they might protect the place from evil.\nVICKI: Well they’re not doing a very good job. How is she even doing that? Making them rise up out of the— I don’t believe it! They’re hovering above the water now!\nVICKI: AND BEGIN TO FLY TOWARDS VICKI AND PROCOPIUS. THEY RUMBLE/HUM\nVERY: SLIGHTLY, SO YOU CAN HEAR THEM APPROACH.\nPROCOPIUS: They’re flying! But that’s impossible.\nVICKI: Impossible or not, they’re coming this way! Back up the steps! Come on —\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 68\nVICKI: PANTING.\nVICKI: Are they following us?\nPROCOPIUS: I don’t think so. I can’t see them.\nVICKI: Did she make that happen? How? Why?\nPROCOPIUS: Perhaps she’s a witch. There are tales of—\nNOT: WIDE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THEM, SO IT BREAKS AS THEY GO. SPLINTERS OF WOOD & CHIPS OF STONE EXPLODE OUTWARD.\nVICKI: They’re coming!\nPROCOPIUS: We’ll never outrun them!\nVICKI: Then let’s not try. Into that ditch - quickly!\nSTONES: SWOOP ABOVE THEIR HEADS, APPARENTLY ABLE TO FLY THROUGH THE AIR. VICKI AND PROCOPIUS PICK THEMSELVES UP.\nVICKI: They’re really flying. How are they flying?\nPROCOPIUS: I feel like I understand less and less every hour.\nVICKI: We need the Doctor.\nPROCOPIUS: But he’s locked up.\nVICKI: Even locked up, he’s still more useful than anyone else we might find round here. Come on!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 69\nDOCTOR: General Belisarius — I told you to return here as the Emperor said and deal with the threat from Persia. Now, why would I do that if I was spying for them?\nBELISARIUS: Perhaps now’s a good time for them to fight us.\nDOCTOR: If I’m any sort of a spy I’d have told them it isn’t! You’ve just bolstered your army with prisoners from your Italian conquests, and if I’d convinced you to stay in Italy, attacking Constantinople from the east would’ve been that much easier.\nBELISARIUS: All right — look, I think you’re probably telling the truth.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nBELISARIUS: But what can I do? The Emperor feels he has evidence.\nDOCTOR: There can be no evidence. I haven’t even been here long enough to leave any [evidence —]\nVICKI: Doctor!\nBELISARIUS: Excuse me, I was in the middle of [talking to —]\nPROCOPIUS: Belisarius, this is an emergency.\nBELISARIUS: Yes. Obviously.\nDOCTOR: What is it, Vicki?\nVICKI: We followed Sophia, and she went to the Basilica, and she chanted and these two stone heads -\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 70\nDOCTOR: The Medusa heads?\nVICKI: (SURPRISED) Yes. How did you know about the-? (BACK TO THE\nSTORY: ) Anyway, they rose up out of the water and started flying, and they broke out of the Basilica and - please, Belisarius, you have to let the Doctor out so he can help.\nBELISARIUS: (LAUGHS) Ridiculous!\nVICKI: Please!\nBELISARIUS: You think you can walk in here with an absurd story like that and secure his freedom?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen far, far stranger things than that, Belisarius — believe me.\nPROCOPIUS: It is absurd, General, but I saw it with my own eyes.\nBELISARIUS: What are you getting from this, Procopius?\nPROCOPIUS: Me? Nothing, [I —]\nBELISARIUS: What’s going on out there?\nVICKI: Maybe they’re here.\nBELISARIUS: Who?\nVICKI: The heads.\nPROCOPIUS: They’ve come to the palace. They mean to attack the Emperor.\nPROCOPIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nVICKI: Gaoler! Let us out — we have to go to the palace!\nPROCOPIUS: ‘We’ have to go?\nVICKI: I have to. I don’t know about you. (EXITS)\nPROCOPIUS: If I must... (EXITS)\nDOCTOR: Shouldn’t you go too, General?\nBELISARIUS: Page 71\nBELISARIUS: Only to prove my secretary deluded. I don’t believe any of\nBELISARIUS: this. (EXITS)\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 72\nYAZID: Ah! Quintus. (COUGHS)\nMONK: I came as quickly as I could, Yazid.\nYAZID: My employees are dropping like flies. You must get them back on their feet, or the race tomorrow... well, it’ll be difficult. You can do something for them? Yes?\nMONK: I’ll have to see them first.\nSTEVEN: (PAINTING) Hello, Quintus.\nMONK: Steven! He’s working you hard, then?\nSTEVEN: Yes, he’s got me on painting duties now.\nYAZID: There’s no time for chit-chat.\nMONK: You haven’t come down with this illness, have you?\nSTEVEN: No. That’s why you’re here?\nMONK: I’m afraid so.\nYAZID: Two of my charioteers plus the chief mechanic and the bear- wrangler have got it now. I need them fit and well by tomorrow.\nSTEVEN: Listen, everyone I’ve seen needs at least three days’ complete rest.\nYAZID: I didn’t ask you.\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 73\nMONK: I’1ll do my best, but you have to understand... I can’t work\nMONK: miracles.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 74\nMONK: AND PROCOPIUS.\nBELISARIUS: Extraordinary. The palace guards have deserted their posts.\nVICKI: Perhaps they saw something that frightened them, General?\nPROCOPIUS: Wouldn’t we know, if they were here? I mean they are quite large.\nVICKI: They’re only about your height, Procopius, they could hide ina corner of a palace this size.\nPROCOPIUS: They seemed bigger when we saw them outside [the Basilica —]\nBELISARIUS: Are you trying to make a fool of me? Is that it?\nVICKI: Why would we want that?\nBELISARIUS: I don’t know, but with all this talk of flying Medusae —\nVICKI: You'll see.\nBELISARIUS: Young lady, I’ve travelled far and wide. Further and wider than you.\nVICKI: Haha! Oh, I wish you knew how funny that was.\nBELISARIUS: And the tales men tell of monsters, every single one of them, are complete —\nVICKI: You were saying?\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 75\nSLAVE: IS WHIMPERING.\nVICKI: Is he a palace guard?\nBELISARIUS: No, just one of the slaves. (TO SLAVE) What did you see, man?\nSLAVE: Stone... heads of stone...\nPROCOPIUS: See? It’s true! I told you —\nBELISARIUS: But we heard nothing.\nVICKI: What sort of noise do you expect a flying stone head to make? They didn’t make a lot of noise when they went past us — just a sort of “whoosh”, and if they’re moving more slowly they [could easily —]\nPROCOPIUS: Behind you! There it is!\nBELISARIUS: What’s behind —\nBELISARIUS: Argh!\nBELISARIUS: THE CORRIDOR. DISTANT YELPS AND SHRIEKS OF SURPRISE.\nBELISARIUS: What — but — that was —\nVICKI: Yeah, that was the thing we’ve been telling you about for the last fifteen minutes.\nBELISARIUS: Have I been poisoned?\nPROCOPIUS: No — we saw it too.\nPROCOPIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 76\nVICKI: Oh, he’s no use — let’s get after it ourselves.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 77\nOCCASIONAL: HUM OF A LASER SOLDERING IRON. SOPHIA ENTERS.\nMONK: (BREAKS OFF WITH THE LASER) Ah, Sophia! Sorry the house is a mess — just move that if you want to sit down.\nSOPHIA: What is all this, Quintus? Where did it come from?\nMONK: I’m just building something using parts from my ship and some other bits and pieces I’ve picked up.\nSOPHIA: What is it?\nMONK: Haha! You’ll see.\nSOPHIA: More of your magic.\nMONK: There is no magic, Sophia. Like those words I gave you to say in the Basilica — to the people of this planet in this era, it sounds like a magical incantation.\nSOPHIA: But it isn’t?\nMONK: Good grief, no! It’s a simple linguistic keycode. (BEAT) It did work, didn’t it?\nSOPHIA: Oh yes, it worked.\nMONK: The Ostardi are free?\nSOPHIA: If that’s what they’re called. I must admit, I wasn’t... fully prepared for that.\nMONK: That isn’t their natural state. They were exiled here, and their form blended into the world around them.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 78\nSOPHIA: I think there was someone there, at the Basilica. When the Ostardi rose up, I heard people running out. I didn’t see who it was —\nMONK: Doesn’t matter.\nSOPHIA: But what if they try to stop us?\nMONK: They can’t.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 79\nJUSTINIAN: Beloved!\nTHEODORA: (WAKING UP) Is it morning?\nJUSTINIAN: No.\nTHEODORA: For heaven’s sake, Justinian, go to bed...\nJUSTINIAN: Why don’t you go to bed? Instead of falling asleep in the dining room. Again.\nTHEODORA: I am the Empress and I will sleep where I like.\nJUSTINIAN: There was shouting. From the other end of the palace.\nTHEODORA: Perhaps one of the servants dropped something.\nJUSTINIAN: Not that sort of shouting, it was —\nJUSTINIAN: AND ENTERS THE ROOM.\nJUSTINIAN: Agh!\nTHEODORA: It’s a... head!\nJUSTINIAN: A flying head! A flying stone —\nOSTARDI: #1 You.\nJUSTINIAN: Me?\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 80\nTHEODORA: What’s happening? What does it want?\nOSTARDI: #1 We are looking for you.\nJUSTINIAN: Why? Why would you — Get away. No!\nJUSTINIAN: THE OSTARDI. THE STONE FOLLOWS.\nOSTARDI: #1 We are looking for you.\nJUSTINIAN: (RETREATING) Leave me alone! It’s got me cornered! Theodora, help me! Help —\nTHEODORA: I’m sorry. I can’t. I —\nOSTARDI: #1 You. You. You.\nJUSTINIAN: (BECOMING ENVELOPED BY THE HEAD) No! Don’t! Get off me! Theodora!\nJUSTINIAN: ITSELF TO JUSTINIAN’S HEAD.\nTHEODORA: The... um... the guards. Yes, I’ll— Farewell. (RUSHES OUT)\nJUSTINIAN: Don’t leave me! Theodoraaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!!!\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 81\nJUSTINIAN: VICKI AND PROCOPIUS.\nPROCOPIUS: Your majesty! Are you all right?\nTHEODORA: Something... something came and — the Emperor —\nVICKI: A giant stone head? Is that what came?\nTHEODORA: Yes and — (DISDAIN) Who is this?\nVICKI: My name is Vicki and kindly don’t address me like I’m something the cat dragged in.\nTHEODORA: I will not be spoken [to —]\nPROCOPIUS: Please! You said the Emperor —\nTHEODORA: Yes, yes, a stone head.\nVICKI: We know that bit. What did the stone head do?\nTHEODORA: It flew into the room, and it got Justinian into the corner... and then it seemed to float down, onto his head, and it... changed shape, and seemed to... become his head. I don’t know, it doesn’t [seem —]\nJUSTINIAN: Is something the matter?\nTHEODORA: Beloved! But the head — the stone head...\nJUSTINIAN: Stone head?\nTHEODORA: I saw it...\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 82\nJUSTINIAN: I came upon you in the dining room. You’d taken your fill of wine and cheese and fallen asleep on a seat... the dreams one dreams after such a meal can be vivid indeed.\nTHEODORA: Oh. A dream. Yes, that must have been-\nVICKI: But we [Saw it too—]\nPROCOPIUS: Vicki... the Emperor knows best.\nVICKI: But —\nPROCOPIUS: Come on. (TO JUSTINIAN) Good night, your highness. Empress.\nTHEODORA: Yes. Yes, I’m sure.. a dream. Yes.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course it was. Let me lead you to your room.\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nBELISARIUS: Procopius! Did you find it?\nPROCOPIUS: (LOUDLY) No, Belisarius.\nVICKI: But it found —\nPROCOPIUS: (LOW) Let’s not discuss it here, Vicki.\nVICKI: What? But the Emperor —\nPROCOPIUS: The Emperor said everything was fine.\nBELISARIUS: (REALISING IT’S NOT FINE) Did he now.\nPROCOPIUS: So there’s nothing more for us to do.\nVICKI: But those —\nPROCOPIUS: (LOW) Yet.\nBELISARIUS: We'll meet again in the morning. Vicki, you’re to house.\nVICKI: (SIGHS) All right.\nBELISARIUS: Cheer up. I have a very nice house.\nBELISARIUS: Page 83\nBELISARIUS: stay at\nBELISARIUS: my\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 84\nMONK: Haha! It works, Sophia. It works!\nSOPHIA: But... can you make it work with people...?\nMONK: Of course. All I need you to do is hold open the hole in space- time [and then —]\nSOPHIA: I’m not sure I can.\nMONK: Nonsense. You’ve done it hundreds of times. It’s why everyone in your village thought you were peculiar, all those objects disappearing into thin air and reappearing.\nSOPHIA: But under pressure — I’ve always had trouble controlling it.\nMONK: Have faith in yourself.\nSOPHIA: But how will you get the Doctor where you want him?\nMONK: Our friends the Ostardi will take care of that. Once the Emperor and Empress are under their control, that is...\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 85\nTHEODORA: I’ve been working too hard. Getting up too early.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course you have. Now, beloved, here’s your bed. Rest.\nTHEODORA: Yes. Yes, I’ll —\nTHEODORA: (CRIES OUT) Justinian! The head!\nOSTARDI: #2 You. We need you.\nTHEODORA: No!\nOSTARDI: #2 We will be you. You. You. You.\nTHEODORA: Keep back! — No! No! (THE HEAD CHANGES SHAPE AS BEFORE. ) Noooo...! 1!\nJUSTINIAN: END OF PART TWO\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 86\nJUSTINIAN: 3: THE CATASTROPHE CURE\nJUSTINIAN: THE WOODEN DOOR OPENS.\nYAZID: Wake up. (BEAT; COUGHS; LOUDER) Wake up! (BEAT; LOUDER STILL)\nYAZID: Wake... up!\nSTEVEN: (SUDDENLY AWAKE) What? — Oh, Yazid, it’s you. You said it was OK for me to sleep in your office, remember?\nYAZID: Steven, I have an- (COUGHS) another little job for you.\nSTEVEN: I was going to put another coat of paint on the wheels.\nYAZID: I’ve seen them. They’ll have to do. Tell me: have you ridden a chariot before?\nSTEVEN: A chariot?\nYAZID: Well, have you or haven’t you? Could be worth a few extra coins:\nSTEVEN: (LYING) Yes.\nYAZID: Where?\nSTEVEN: In, er — in Italy.\nYAZID: Ha! What they have there isn’t racing, it’s a canter round the park with a lady friend. But you know the basics?\nSTEVEN: It’s been a while, I’m a little rusty, but —\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 87\nYAZID: Then you’ve got seven hours to make yourself less rusty. You’re riding second chariot today.\nSTEVEN: What? I need more time. Couldn’t we just—\nYAZID: No.\nSTEVEN: Is there no-one else?\nYAZID: Plenty of men in this city would kill for an opportunity like this.\nSTEVEN: Then where are they?\nYAZID: (SIGHS) A lot of money’s been bet on this race. But due to illness my team consists of my second charioteer racing first, and a novice. And people are going to be very angry with the drivers who lost their money. That is why I’m asking you. So?\nSTEVEN: (BEAT) I’1l do it —\nYAZID: Excellent.\nSTEVEN: If you pay my passage back to Ravenna, in full.\nYAZID: No. I said a few extra coins. You think I’m made of money?\nSTEVEN: I’1ll go back to painting wheels then shall I?\nYAZID: All right, all right. Although after you lose, you might want to run straight out of here and get on the boat.\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 88\nVICKI: Do you know what these stone creatures are, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No idea, I’m afraid.\nPROCOPIUS: The puzzling thing was how Justinian denied they were there. We all saw them. He didn’t even seem interested.\nVICKI: Yes, I’ve been thinking about that. Either he’s the one who brought them here —\nPROCOPIUS: He’s been known to make deals with outsiders - but flying Medusae?\nVICKI: Or... they’ve gained some kind of control over him.\nDOCTOR: It’s possible. There are beings out there that are capable of gaining control over any one of us.\nPROCOPIUS: You mean — the Emperor’s will might not be his own?\nDOCTOR: Exactly that.\nVICKI: How would we be able to tell if he was being controlled?\nBELISARIUS: Good news, Doctor, you’re free to go.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nBELISARIUS: I wouldn’t query it, I’d just get out before the Emperor changes his mind.\nDOCTOR: Justinian told you to set me free?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 89\nBELISARIUS: He said he’d re-examined the evidence against you and decided it didn’t hold up. Here (A JANGLE OF A KEY ON A METAL RING) - the key to your manacles. (TOSSES KEY)\nDOCTOR: (CATCHES KEY) Thank you.\nVICKI: Surely that proves it, if he’s suddenly changed his mind about something so important...?\nBELISARIUS: Proves what?\nPROCOPIUS: We think the Emperor... we think he may be under the control of those monsters we saw last night.\nBELISARIUS: Hm.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s better. — General. Please don’t tell me that what you all saw was some shared delusion?\nBELISARIUS: I am not deluded, Doctor!\nVICKI: Well, then.\nBELISARIUS: I’m pledged to protect the Empire from danger. But what happened last night is nothing I understand.\nDOCTOR: Whoever had me imprisoned wanted to make sure I didn’t interfere with these creatures taking control of the Emperor — who, may I remind you all, is currently the most powerful person in the world.\nBELISARIUS: Then why let you go now?\nVICKI: Yes, it would’ve been easy enough to just leave you down here.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 90\nDOCTOR: Good point. If only we knew what he was up to.\nPROCOPIUS: I do. As a matter of fact, it so happens that the Emperor is going to announce the action against Persia at this afternoon’s chariot race...\nVICKI: (THRILLED) Chariot race! — Oh Doctor, can we go?\nDOCTOR: We should really be looking for Steven.\nBELISARIUS: Ah yes — I made some enquiries and a man matching your friend’s description arrived with the injured and captured from Ravenna — but he was released upon arrival in Constantinople.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nBELISARIUS: Someone on the same boat vouched for him. Medical man, name of Quintus...\nPROCOPIUS: Quintus? I know the fellow. He lives in Constantinople. I should have his address in my records.\nDOCTOR: Then we’ll go right away.\nBELISARIUS: Not yet, Doctor — Justinian wants to apologise to you personally for your false imprisonment.\nPROCOPIUS: Now that is out of character.\nDOCTOR: Still, an audience with the Emperor would be helpful. — Vicki, would you go with Procopius and follow up this lead on Steven?\nVICKI: Of course.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 91\nSTEVEN: Woah. Woah! (BEAT) I said WOAH!\nSTEVEN: (TO SELF) All right. I’m getting the hang of this. I hope.\nMONK: (OFF) Very impressive.\nSTEVEN: Oh, Quintus!\nMONK: Very impressive indeed. For a beginner.\nSTEVEN: (LOW) Is it that obvious?\nMONK: Well...\nSTEVEN: (LOW) Don’t tell Yazid. He thinks I know what I’m doing.\nMONK: My lips are sealed.\nSTEVEN: What are you doing here? Checking up on your patients?\nMONK: Yes. I’m afraid the infection is spreading. It’s very severe.\nSTEVEN: You mean — ?\nMONK: At least two of them won’t last until tomorrow.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 92\nSTEVEN: That bad? Surely they can’t hold a race with all that going on.\nMONK: When there’s money to be won they will.\nSTEVEN: But there’s hardly anyone left to run it - and bringing thousands of people here when there’s a deadly infection spreading?\nMONK: If they cancel it, there’1ll be riots.\nSTEVEN: Is that worse than...\nMONK: Plague? No, probably not.\nSTEVEN: Plague? Really?\nMONK: I’ve set up a treatment room near the stables — I don’t think they’re well enough to move. You’re sure you’re all right?\nSTEVEN: Yes. I almost wish I wasn’t. Then I could get out of this race.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 93\nSTEVEN: THEODORA. THE OTHERS ENTER & APPROACH.\nBELISARIUS: Your majesties, may I present [the —]\nJUSTINIAN: Is this him? The Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Hello.\nTHEODORA: We apologise most humbly for detaining you unjustly, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That’s quite all right. It happens to me regularly, although almost nobody ever says sorry.\nBELISARIUS: May we know who accused the Doctor of spying?\nJUSTINIAN: I’m afraid not.\nTHEODORA: The person who provided us with this information did so in good faith — to expose him would be unfair.\nBELISARIUS: So.. you are in accord on this issue.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course.\nTHEODORA: Please, Doctor — we’ve treated you abominably. Allow us to amend an injustice with a kindness. You must accompany us to the chariot race. You can sit with us, in the imperial box.\nDOCTOR: I'd be honoured.\nBELISARIUS: Your majesties — I’m concerned that the race might not go ahead.\nJUSTINIAN: Why?\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 94\nBELISARIUS: I’ve heard tell of an illness affecting many of those who work at the Hippodrome.\nDOCTOR: I should get over there. I can help.\nJUSTINIAN: Can you? You are a physician?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. But it’s safe to say my experience of disease is probably broader than anyone you have available.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 95\nPROCOPIUS: I’ve not actually been here before. I tend to avoid doctors, if I can.\nVICKI: Very wise.\nPROCOPIUS: (STOPPING BEFORE A DOOR) Ah! This must be it — (READS) ‘The house of Quintus. Medicus to the maximus.’ Hmm. Rather odd.\nVICKI: Gosh. He’s not short of a bob or two. Here goes...\nSOPHIA: Vicki, hello.\nVICKI: Sophia! What [are you-]\nSOPHIA: How are you finding Constantinople?\nVICKI: It’s, er, marvellous.\nSOPHIA: If you’re after Quintus, he’s not here right now.\nPROCOPIUS: Perhaps we could come in. Thank you.\nVICKI: Sophia — this Quintus, is he the friend you said you'd be staying with in Constantinople? The man who took you from your village?\nSOPHIA: Yes.\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 96\nVICKI: It turns out he’s also the man who found my friend Steven, and he treated his wounds on the way back to Constantinople. Didn’t you realise he was in Ravenna at the same time as you?\nSOPHIA: No. Not until I got back. Sorry.\nVICKI: No need to apologise. It’s a bit of a coincidence, that’s all. — Ooh, is that a Grecian urn, on the table? How pretty!\nSOPHIA: Please, be careful. All of these are Quintus’ things.\nPROCOPIUS: Should we wait here for him?\nSOPHIA: I’m not sure when he’1ll be back. He’s at the Hippodrome, you see.\nPROCOPIUS: Did he go early to get a good seat for the races?\nSOPHIA: There’s been an outbreak of sickness, [I’m afraid]\nVICKI: Oh no! Butterfingers.\nSOPHIA: I told you to be careful!\nVICKI: I’m so sorry, was it very valuable?\nPROCOPIUS: I doubt it. You get them by the dozen in the bazaar.\nVICKI: I think we should go — don’t you, Procopius?\nPROCOPIUS: It’s only a Grecian urn.\nVICKI: We might catch Quintus at the races.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 97\nPROCOPIUS: But there’s a whole hour before —\nVICKI: (SHARPLY) Let’s go, Procopius!\nSOPHIA: Enjoy the race.\nPROCOPIUS: Thank you!\nPROCOPIUS: Why did you hurry us away, Vicki?\nVICKI: Because I took this from the side table. I smashed the urn so she wouldn’t see me swipe it.\nPROCOPIUS: A parchment?\nVICKI: With a blue ribbon, see? It was just sitting there. Daft of her to leave it lying around.\nPROCOPIUS: The parchment she read those words from last night. The ones that released those Medusa creatures!\nVICKI: Exactly. I think the Doctor could use this.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 98\nYAZID: How did the practice go, Steven? Managed to not kill yourself yet? (COUGHS)\nSTEVEN: Yazid? Are you all right?\nYAZID: (COUGHS PROLIFICALLY) Fine, fine. Good crowd building up out there.\nSTEVEN: I was hoping to have another few runs around the track before the race.\nYAZID: Too late for that now, not when the punters are in. You’re clear on the strategy?\nSTEVEN: Yes, we’ve discussed it — Thebus is going to take the outside track, all I have to do is sit in the inside and block the others from coming through.\nYAZID: Excellent.\nSTEVEN: It does sound rather dangerous.\nYAZID: It is rather dangerous. What, are you afraid?\nSTEVEN: Well... yes, a bit.\nYAZID: Then make sure you stay ahead — (COUGHS) ahead of (COUGHS\nREPEATEDLY: )\nSTEVEN: Are you sure you’re all right?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Steven!\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 99\nSTEVEN: Doctor?\nSTEVEN: Doctor! Am I glad to see you!\nYAZID: Well I’m not. I don’t need a doctor. It’s just a cough.\nDOCTOR: It’s good to see you, Steven.\nSTEVEN: Likewise. I mean, I know my Doctor would try his best to find me, but — I couldn’t be sure you’d be the same.\nDOCTOR: I’m the same man, Steven. A friend of his is a friend of mine, literally.\nBELISARIUS: This is your friend?\nDOCTOR: It certainly is.\nSTEVEN: I can’t believe it. You came all this way to Constantinople? How’d you know I was here? At the Hippodrome, I mean.\nDOCTOR: I must admit, I didn’t. Vicki’s out looking for you, I came here to help with this illness.\nBELISARIUS: Are you in the race today, young man?\nSTEVEN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: You’re chariot racing? What on earth for?\nSTEVEN: I took a job in the stables to pay my way back to Italy. But most of the team’s gone down with this virus.\nYAZID: Pathetic, isn’t it? (COUGHS)\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 100\nSTEVEN: So, I’m racing instead. But now you’re here, Doctor — I don’t need the money, so maybe I could [just step —]\nYAZID: You’re not backing out now. Not if you like having five fingers on each hand. I hired you; you race. We had a deal.\nSTEVEN: All right. I’m going to get prepped for the race — but you need to get help. Medical help. Now.\nYAZID: I don’t need doctors — (COUGHS) I don’t —\nDOCTOR: I think you do.\nSTEVEN: Quintus has set up his clinic through there — down the hall, past the curtain.\nDOCTOR: Good. Help me, Belisarius — that’s where we need to take him.\nBELISARIUS: I’d rather not touch him.\nYAZID: I’m fine.\nDOCTOR: Good luck, Steven.\nSTEVEN: Thanks, I’1l need it.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 101\nARE: CHATTERING EXCITEDLY INSIDE.\nVICKI: Please, Mr Guard. Let us inside the Hippodrome, just for a couple of minutes? It’s terrible important. We’re looking for a man named Quintus.\nGUARD: Can’t let anyone in this close to the race.\nVICKI: We need to talk to him — it’s the only way we’ll find my friend. Look, at least tell us if he’s in there.\nPROCOPIUS: Vicki — let’s go and watch the race, shall we? If Quintus is in there now, he’1l probably still be there afterwards.\nVICKI: (SIGHS) All right.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 102\nVICKI: TO DEAL WITH THE SICK. DOCTOR AND BELISARIUS STRUGGLE THROUGH WITH YAZID.\nBELISARIUS: So many! I didn’t realise it was this bad.\nYAZID: Urrrrgh...\nDOCTOR: Bad and getting worse. (CALLS) Excuse me? I say, excuse me?\nMONK: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Do you have somewhere this chap can lie down? He needs urgent — Wait. ‘Doctor’?\nMONK: (GLEEFUL) Wait for what, Doctor? For the penny to drop? (WITH\nINCREASING: BITTERNESS) For the dimensional circuit to repair itself? For the desolate ice world to thaw?\nDOCTOR: It’s you. Oh, no. You’re ‘Quintus’?\nMONK: (CLAPS HANDS) Haha! The look on your face!\nBELISARIUS: You know him?\nDOCTOR: He looked different when we last met, but I’d know this fellow anywhere. He’s the Monk.\nMONK: You’re the only one who calls me that, you know.\nDOCTOR: Would you like me to use your real name?\nMONK: No more than you’d like me to use yours.\nBELISARIUS: He’s a monk?\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 103\nDOCTOR: Not a real one. In fact very little about him is genuine.\nYAZID: It’s so hot. I need water...\nMONK: Bring him here.\nDOCTOR: What are you playing at?\nMONK: You can either stand there being suspicious, Doctor, or you can help. It’s entirely up to you.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nMONK: Page 104\nVICKI: It seems like everyone in the city’s come to see the race.\nPROCOPIUS: Mm. The races aren’t what they used to be. Too much\nPROCOPIUS: gamesmanship now, it used to be about skill.\nVICKI: We’1ll never see the Doctor amongst this lot...\nPROCOPIUS: He’s supposed to be watching from the Imperial\nVICKI: They’re coming out. Whoever ‘they’ are.\nPROCOPIUS: The charioteers. Hmm. I don’t recognise any of this illness. Glad I didn’t bet on it now.\nVICKI: Steven!\nPROCOPIUS: Where? In the crowd?\nVICKI: No, in the chariot! (CALLS) Steven! Steven!\nVICKI: No, I didn’t mean — Oh, what’s the use.\nPROCOPIUS: box. Over there.\nPROCOPIUS: them. Must be\nPROCOPIUS: STEVEN!”\nPROCOPIUS: Why didn’t say your friend was a chariot racer?!\nVICKI: Because he isn’t. (CROSS TO:)\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 105\nMONK: Doctor? There’s a pestle and mortar just behind you, could you pass it please?\nDOCTOR: What’s in this? (SNIFFS) Mint?\nMONK: For the nausea. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: What good will that do? These people need antibiotics, not herbs: amino glycosides, tetracyclines, fluoro[quinolone-]\nMONK: (LOW) Please, Doctor. Not so loud! My patients need all the hope they can get. (NORMAL) Open your mouth.\nMONK: I’m going to spread a little under your nose, too. The paste will help clear your lungs...\nBELISARIUS: The race is starting.\nDOCTOR: Go and watch it if you like.\nBELISARIUS: No, I’1ll stay here. How do you know this man?\nDOCTOR: We're from the same place. Although what we’re currently doing in the same place is a mystery. (A THOUGHT OCCURS TO HIM.) He’s the one who had me arrested! (TO MONK) Aren’t you? And you must have something to do with the incident at the palace last night.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 106\nBELISARIUS: Why must he?\nDOCTOR: Because he’s a meddler.\nMONK: Unlike you, of course.\nDOCTOR: I care about the consequences of my actions.\nMONK: You think I don’t? Now if you don’t mind, I need to loosen the patient’s clothes. He’s burning up.\nBELISARIUS: Ugh.\nMONK: Yes, they’re all presenting with sores like these.\nDOCTOR: Are any septicaemic?\nMONK: Only one or two so far, the rest are bubonic.\nBELISARIUS: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Plague.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 107\nVICKI: Come on, Steven!\nPROCOPIUS: He’s doing quite well.\nVICKI: But he’s miles behind the others. They’re almost going to lap him.\nPROCOPIUS: Exactly. He’s going to hold that line, and then he’1l do his best to block the opposition so his team-mate can come through.\nVICKI: So what he’s doing is actually good?\nPROCOPIUS: Yes. They often get inexperienced drivers to do this because, well, they don’t want to waste an experienced driver on it.\nVICKI: Waste?\nPROCOPIUS: It can be dangerous. But it’s unlikely to go wrong, as long as he doesn’t do anything rash...\nVICKI: Oh dear. (SHOUTS) Be careful, Steven!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 108\nDOCTOR: The first cases of plague in Constantinople aren’t supposed to be recorded for another year.\nBELISARIUS: What do you mean, supposed to be?\nDOCTOR: It’s difficult to explain. It’s... (SIGHS) a prophecy.\nMONK: (CHUCKLES) Oh dear, oh dear.\nBELISARIUS: I didn’t think you believed in such things, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: This one is very well founded. It will cripple Constantinople — at its peak, five thousand people will die every day. The Emperor himself will catch it, [but —]\nBELISARIUS: The Emperor?\nDOCTOR: He'll survive, don’t worry. But it will damage your efforts to reunify the Empire — your armies and supply lines will be seriously depleted. And I’d like to know why is it here a year early?\nMONK: Sometimes the history books are wrong, Doctor. The date of the Plagues of Justinian isn’t precise. It could have happened now. It is happening now.\nMONK: Relax, relax.\nDOCTOR: What are you giving him now?\nMONK: Rosewater, lavender and sage.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 109\nBELISARIUS: Will that help?\nDOCTOR: Barely.\nMONK: It’ll ease his headache, help him rest.\nDOCTOR: And that’s it?\nMONK: It’s better treatment than he’ll get from the other physicians around here, with their purgatives and bleedings. The best we can do is make him comfortable and give his own immune system a chance to fight off the infection.\nDOCTOR: Even then, his chance is fifty-fifty at best.\nMONK: You think I should use anti-inflammatories? Antibiotics? I haven’t got any. (RUMMAGES IN HIS CLOTHING) See: empty pock[ets]- (FINDS SOMETHING) Hang about. What’s this? Well, well. A tube of Nanosalve.\nDOCTOR: Nanosalve?\nMONK: Why, this could cure our patient in a matter of minutes.\nDOCTOR: Are you going to use it?\nMONK: No. But you could.\nDOCTOR: But... once that stuff gets into someone’s body —\nMONK: It becomes a permanent part of their immune system, yes. And it spreads on contact to stop the infection.\nDOCTOR: That would change the world.\nMONK: Yes, it would.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page\nDOCTOR: Why are you doing this?\nMONK: I’m just making a point.\nDOCTOR: With a man dying in front of you.\nMONK: Which goes to show what a powerful point it is.\nBELISARIUS: Doctor, is he saying... you could save this man’s life?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nBELISARIUS: Afraid? What are you afraid of?\nDOCTOR: Everything. Don’t you see — it would change everything.\nDOCTOR: 110\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 111\nPROCOPIUS: One lap to go! (SHOUTS) Come on, Blues!\nVICKI: They’re going to win! Steven’s team is going to win!\nPROCOPIUS: No, the Greens aren’t done yet — they’1ll try to get past your friend somehow.\nVICKI: Come on, Steven! (BEAT) And be careful!\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 112\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: CHARIOT ON COURSE.\nSTEVEN: Oh, no you don’t, matey —\nSTEVEN: Haha! You shall not pass!\nSTEVEN: Whoa! — What d’you think you’re playing at, you lunatic?!\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 113\nPROCOPIUS: The green driver’s trying to turn him over! Knock Steven out of\nPROCOPIUS: his own chariot.\nVICKI: But he mustn’t!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 114\nSTEVEN: Uff! — Maniac! You nearly killed [me]!\nSTEVEN: OVER.\nSTEVEN: Aaaaagh!\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 115\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: SEEING.\nVICKI: Steven! He’s fallen — Steven!!\nPROCOPIUS: Vicki, no — you can’t go down there, it isn’t safe.\nVICKI: Procopius, let me go!\nVICKI: AS THE WINNER CROSSES THE LINE.\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 116\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: TO HIM.\nVICKI: (OFF) Out of my way. Please! — (RUNNING UP) Steven! Steven!\nSTEVEN: Vicki? — Vicki, it’s you!\nVICKI: Oh, you’re all right! I came all this way to find you, and I thought you’d died right in front of me!\nSTEVEN: I’m fine, I’m — What happened?\nVICKI: You were trying to stop one of the other drivers from manoeuvring past you, and it came up on the inside and knocked you [flying —]\nSTEVEN: I mean, which team won?\nVICKI: Who cares which team won?\nPROCOPIUS: Yours did. Now can we please get off the track?\nSTEVEN: Sure — can you help me stand —\nSTEVEN: Argh!\nVICKI: Your leg?\nSTEVEN: Yes — I think it’s broken.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 117\nBELISARIUS: If you don’t use this ‘Nanny-salve’, Doctor, I will. (REACHES\nFOR: TUBE)\nMONK: (SNATCHES TUBE AWAY) Uh, uh, uh! — I want to see the Doctor do rts\nDOCTOR: Why? Because then I’1l be as bad as you?\nMONK: Doctor, you interfere in history all the time.\nDOCTOR: Only when it would change history if I didn’t interfere. Do you know how many times I’ve landed in a place, known that the ancient menace that lurks there isn’t supposed to rise up and conquer the galaxy, and it’s up to me to stop it? And that if I fail, the timelines will be skewed out of all recognition?\nMONK: Poor Doctor, the weight of the universe on his shoulders.\nDOCTOR: I can’t use that — I just can’t. The consequences —\nMONK: Are academic now. The man Yazid.. is dead.\nBELISARIUS: Could you really have saved him?\nDOCTOR: You think I didn’t want to? This is technology you’re not ready for — I’m not going to be so irresponsible as to —\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 118\nPROCOPIUS: Help! We need help on the track. (SEEING THE DOCTOR) Ah, Doctor! Your friend - the charioteer - he’s injured.\nDOCTOR: Steven?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 119\nDOCTOR: STILL ON THE TRACK.\nVICKI: Try not to move, Steven.\nDOCTOR: Steven! — Vicki, is he all right?\nVICKI: He’s broken his leg.\nDOCTOR: Let’s have a look.\nDOCTOR: sorry.\nSTEVEN: What do you think?\nDOCTOR: It is broken, I’m afraid. And it’s broken in a bad place.\nSTEVEN: What, you mean the ankle?\nDOCTOR: No, I mean sixth-century Constantinople. We’re hundreds of miles from the TARDIS, and our access to medicine is very, very limited indeed.\nSTEVEN: Get my friend Quintus out here. He’s treating the sick in that low building over there.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I’m afraid Quintus is... well, he’s isn’t Quintus. And he isn’t your friend.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nSTEVEN: What are you talking about? If Quintus isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: He’s the Monk.\nSTEVEN: The Monk!\nVICKI: The Monk Monk? He’s here?\nSTEVEN: You're joking. But he doesn’t look [anything\nDOCTOR: He can change his appearance, just as I can.\nSTEVEN: And he let me think he was — ohh, wait until him...!\nVICKI: Later, Steven — you’re in no fit state now.\nSTEVEN: I can’t believe this.\nBELISARIUS: Is he all right?\nDOCTOR: Page 120\nDOCTOR: Quintus, who is\nDOCTOR: like —]\nDOCTOR: I get my hands on\nDOCTOR: Ah! Belisarius — we need a stretcher for Steven.\nBELISARIUS: I’1ll gather some men to help carry him.\nDOCTOR: And Procopius — could you fetch some water and sour wine, so I\nDOCTOR: can clean the wound?\nPROCOPIUS: Of course.\nVICKI: Doctor — I know you’re busy with Steven now, found this parchment.\nVICKI: but look — we\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 121\nDOCTOR: What about it?\nVICKI: It’s what Sophia used to release those stone heads. I saw her reading from it at the Basilica.\nDOCTOR: It’s a verbal key. Normally these wouldn’t be written down, they’d be memorised — the Monk must have cracked this one and then scribbled it down for Sophia.\nVICKI: Is it useful?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes — I can easily adapt this to reverse the process, just like a normal key — one way to lock, the other way to unlock. Well done, Vicki!\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 122\nDOCTOR: NB: JUSTINIAN & THEODORA ARE POSSESSED BY THE OSTARDI.\nJUSTINIAN: A most entertaining race.\nTHEODORA: I think they’re expecting you to speak now.\nJUSTINIAN: I wonder how they’1l react?\nTHEODORA: Tell them and see.\nJUSTINIAN: People of Constantinople! We have an announcement to make. (MUTTERINGS FROM THE CROWD) You may have heard of the successful completion of our military activities in Italy (ROUSING CHEERS FROM THE CROWD), for which we congratulate our general, Belisarius. (MORE CHEERS FROM THE CROWD) We feel this is a fitting final campaign for the army of the Roman Empire, which is to be disbanded with immediate effect.\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page\nDOCTOR: What did he say? I couldn’t hear.\nVICKI: Me neither.\nDOCTOR: Ah — Belisarius is coming back with the stretcher.\nSTEVEN: Good.\nBELISARIUS: Did you hear that?\nVICKI: What did he say?\nBELISARIUS: He’s disbanding the army.\nDOCTOR: What? What are they doing?\nBELISARIUS: I’m about to go up there and ask the Emperor that.\nDOCTOR: I’m coming with you.\nVICKI: And me.\nSTEVEN: I’1ll just lie here then, shall I?\nSTEVEN: 123\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 124\nPLAGUE: VICTIMS\nMONK: Ah! Sophia. Did the girl Vicki take the key?\nSOPHIA: Yes, I made sure to leave it out. Did the Doctor use your nanothing?\nMONK: No, but I knew he wouldn’t. We should get into position.\nSOPHIA: What about these people?\nMONK: Oh, there’s nothing I can do for them now. In a few minutes won’t even matter.\nMONK: ate 3\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 125\nMONK: NB: JUSTINIAN & THEODORA ARE POSSESSED BY THE OSTARDI.\nTHEODORA: You’d think they’d be more pleased you’re disbanding the army. I mean, a lot of people do die in all those wars they insist on having.\nJUSTINIAN: Give them time to get used to the idea.\nJUSTINIAN: DOCTOR AND VICKI.\nBELISARIUS: Justinian? What’s the meaning of this?\nDOCTOR: Careful, Belisarius — we don’t know what they can do.\nVICKI: (SOTTO) Doctor, use the key!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Not yet, Vicki.\nJUSTINIAN: No more wars.\nJUSTINIAN: THEODORA. An age of peace.\nBELISARIUS: But the campaign in Persia is [about to —]\nTHEODORA: Which you privately believe is a foolish undertaking.\nDOCTOR: Are you trying to open the empire up to attack? What game are you playing?\nTHEODORA: It’s not a game.\nJUSTINIAN: We will make an offer to our enemies.\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 126\nBELISARIUS: What offer?\nJUSTINIAN: We will cure their sick.\nTHEODORA: We are the Ostardi. We cure.\nJUSTINIAN: Les: Our gi tt.\nBELISARIUS: The Ostardi?\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Oh no...\nTHEODORA: We were sealed in stone and exiled here by people who resented our power.\nJUSTINIAN: Our influence.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure I agree with what they did, but I see their point. You’re bargaining with your gift.\nTHEODORA: Only to stop conflict.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes we need conflict. Often it’s pointless and destructive, yes, but it’s also how tyrants are defeated.\nTHEODORA: Don’t waste time arguing with him. Stop the plague.\nJUSTINIAN: I will generate an antiviral.\nDOCTOR: No, stop! I have the code here — the one that released you. And I can use it to return you to stone.\nTHEODORA: You’d stop us saving thousands upon thousands from a painful death? Why?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Because...\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 127\nVICKI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what to do.\nTHEODORA: Oh, Doctor. You hesitated.\nJUSTINIAN: And now it’s too late.\nTHEODORA: It’s done.\nDOCTOR: What? Just like that?\nJUSTINIAN: Just like that.\nDOCTOR: No. Wait! This is wrong! You have to undo what you did!\nTHEODORA: I’m afraid we’ve other matters to attend to. Come on, dearest.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course.\nDOCTOR: No!\nBELISARIUS: Where did they go?\nDOCTOR: Come back. Come back — you have to —\nBELISARIUS: We need to settle this crowd or there’ll be a riot.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter. Not now...\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 128\nBELISARIUS: It matters to me.\nDOCTOR: What have I done?\nVICKI: Maybe — maybe it’s not as bad as you think.\nDOCTOR: It’s not what I think that matters.\nMONK: (LAUGHS) Humility at last, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: You. You set this up...\nVICKI: What’s this about, Sophia?\nSOPHIA: Quintus told me what you did to him, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What I did?\nMONK: Well — what you will do. Many people will die — including someone very, very dear to me. You told me it was my fault — but it all started because of you. You and your high-handed, holier-than-thou attitude — how dare you tell me I killed her?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea what you’re talking about.\nMONK: It hasn’t happened yet. And it won’t ever. Not now.\nVICKI: I don’t understand — the Doctor didn’t even do anything.\nMONK: Exactly! Your Doctor would have done something. He wouldn’t have faltered like this one did. He’d have put the Ostardi back in their boxes and left the plague to happen.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 129\nMONK: IN THE WAR GAMES EPISODE 10 STARTS. THE SOUND OF THE CROWD BEGINS TO SLOW, LIKE A RECORD SLOWING DOWN.\nDOCTOR: This was an impossible situation! There was no right choice!\nMONK: Perhaps. But your former self chose differently. You haven’t just changed the timelines — you’ve changed your own.\nDOCTOR: You did this. You switched me with myself — you’ve been lurking, waiting for me to make a mistake...\nMONK: And you’ve made one. And I’m afraid our people have noticed.\nVICKI: What’s that noise?\nDOCTOR: The Time Lords.\nVICKI: What Lords?\nDOCTOR: My own people. Most changes to the timeline, they turn a blind eye to — but when a Time Lord alters his or her own timeline, they know how dangerous that can be.\nMONK: They’1l take you out of time completely — your entire timeline will be suspended until they can investigate and repair any damage.\nVICKI: Doctor! You're... you’re fading away!\nDOCTOR: (BECOMING FAINTER) It’s the Time Lords, Vicki. Don’t worry, I’1ll tell them what happened. I’1l tell them what he’s [done. ]\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 130\nVICKI: Doctor! Where are you? — Doctor!!!\nMONK: The Time Lords, Doctor? They’1ll know nothing. — Sophia!\nSOPHIA: Yes, yes.\nVICKI: Everything's... everything’s stopped.\nMONK: That’s dear Sophia’s doing. She’s holding the Doctor’s timeline open. Look — the gap in the world where the Doctor used to be. That greyish Doctor-shaped space, there.\nVICKI: No...\nMONK: And the wonder of this little device I’ve built —\nMONK: — is that it enables me to step into the Doctor’s place.\nVICKI: Into his place? But you can’t!\nMONK: It’s already happening. I’m taking over his timeline. I’1l be the Doctor, and he’1ll be nobody. Nobody at all. (LAUGHS)\nVICKI: No!\nVICKI: END OF PART THREE\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 131\nVICKI: 4: THE TWISTS OF FATE\nVICKI: STORY. MONK, VICKI AND STEVEN DISEMBARK.\nVICKI: Is this near where we were in Italy before, Doctor?\nMONK: Yes, Vicki, but much later. The old Roman empire’s on its last legs now, although don’t tell them that. Isn’t even based in Rome any more. This way, I think.\nSTEVEN: What’s so special about this place?\nMONK: Used to be the capital city of the Western Roman Empire, Steven. In a couple of hours, an important man is going to barge into this city and take it over, and I’d like to meet him.\nSTEVEN: Nice town.\nMONK: Yes. Shame it gets mostly forgotten after this siege... maybe we should do something about that?\nVICKI: Sounds good.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 132\nSOPHIA: Thank you for granting me an audience, your majesty. Your palace is wonderful.\nJUSTINIAN: Yes, we know. You’re very welcome, evr...\nSOPHIA: Sophia.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course.\nSOPHIA: I came to Constantinople, because I feel... I lost something here.\nJUSTINIAN: Oh dear. Someone’s probably walked off with it by now.\nSOPHIA: No no, it’s more than that... It’s hard to explain.\nTHEODORA: Oh, this one’s pretty. Your taste is improving, my dear.\nJUSTINIAN: It isn’t like that, beloved.\nTHEODORA: Not yet, no. Don’t mind me.\nJUSTINIAN: Her name is Sophia.\nTHEODORA: Didn’t you have a Sophia before?\nJUSTINIAN: No. (BEAT) Or did I...? Anyway, do you mind? She was in the middle of telling me something.\nTHEODORA: No no, go ahead.\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 133\nSOPHIA: I keep seeing this city in a dream. And in the dream, I’m with a man called Quintus. He tells me I’m special. That my father — he died when I was very young — was not of this world, and that’s why... well, that’s why I have the dreams I do.\nTHEODORA: What dreams?\nSOPHIA: How things might have been. I’m also... I’m troubled by the future. Things have... gone awry. I feel a terrible world awaits us.\nTHEODORA: What a lovely story. Why does this have anything to do with us?\nSOPHIA: I need to find him, I feel he’s important to me. Do you know this Quintus? He seemed to know you.\nJUSTINIAN: Sorry, my dear.\nSOPHIA: I feel I may find him, or whatever it was I lost, at the imperial box at the Hippodrome — but they won’t let me up there without your permission. Please?\nJUSTINIAN: Can’t see the harm in a charming person such as yourself visiting the place. Very well. You have our special permission to enter the imperial box.\nSOPHIA: Thank you! (EXITS)\nJUSTINIAN: There. All sorted out and no harm done.\nTHEODORA: So long as she doesn’t touch anything.\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 134\nBELISARIUS: What did I tell you, Procopius? No bloodshed. Cleanest victory you’ll ever see, and here we are in the palace with our feet up before lunchtime.\nPROCOPIUS: There is some.. unhappiness at your rejection of their offer, Belisarius.\nBELISARIUS: Only to be expected. Let them know I’m flattered, but my commitment to the restoration of the true Roman Empire is total and I hope they can respect this.\nPROCOPIUS: very well, I —\nBELISARIUS: No, wait. I’1ll tell them. I’m in the mood for a speech.\nPROCOPIUS: Before you do that — and I’m sorry if this darkens your mood, general - but there has been a message from the Emperor.\nBELISARIUS: Oh.\nPROCOPIUS: Recalling you to Constantinople.\nBELISARIUS: What?!\nPROCOPIUS: He believes the threat from Persia is escalating, and he intends to focus [his resources —]\nBELISARIUS: He intends to get me out of Italy. I’ve taken back Rome and I have the respect of the people — he’s afraid I might build my own power base here.\nPROCOPIUS: That does seem to be the subtext. Shall I make preparations to depart?\nPROCOPIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 135\nBELISARIUS: Why?\nPROCOPIUS: Well... he is the Emperor.\nMONK: (FROM A DISTANCE) So what?\nBELISARIUS: Exactly. (BEAT) Who are you?\nPROCOPIUS: Oh yes — I met them out in the city. They’re travellers.\nMONK: (APPROACHING) I’m the Doctor, and this is Steven and Vicki.\nVICKI: Good to meet you.\nSTEVEN: Nice work on the whole siege business.\nBELISARIUS: I’m a little busy for meeting and greeting.\nMONK: Yes, you’ve got the rest of Italy to conquer.\nPROCOPIUS: Er.. Doctor, [I think —]\nBELISARIUS: Let him speak. (TO MONK) That was my intention, yes. But if I don’t return, the Emperor [will —]\nMONK: The Emperor can do nothing about it. Most of his army is here, along with his finest general.\nBELISARIUS: Well, that’s for others to say.\nMONK: If you tell him the situation here is critical, and you can’t abandon it now, and regretfully you have to stay and fight... well, if there really is a threat from Persia, the stupidest thing he could possibly do would be to send what forces he has here to attack you.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 136\nPROCOPIUS: He has proved himself capable of doing quite stupid things in the past.\nBELISARIUS: Hush, Procopius. This... Doctor... is right. The Emperor knows he can’t challenge me directly, that’s why he’s resorted to these tactics. If I refuse to return, he’ll be stuck.\nVICKI: He won’t want to admit that you challenged his authority.\nBELISARIUS: Exactly.\nPROCOPIUS: But what about Persia?\nMONK: Oh, we’ve just come from there. Haven’t we?\nSTEVEN: Mm? Oh, yes. Nothing to worry about, it’s all been blown out of proportion.\nBELISARIUS: It’s settled then — I shall stay and complete the conquest of Italy.\nPROCOPIUS: I shall write to the Emperor and inform him of your decision, stressing that the situation in Italy demands it.\nMONK: May I suggest that this message might carry more weight were it accompanied by eyewitness accounts of the situation in Italy?\nBELISARIUS: Good thought.\nMONK: My friends and I have business in Constantinople, as it happens, and would gladly seek an audience with the Emperor to aid your cause.\nBELISARIUS: I’1l make sure of it. Excellent!\nBELISARIUS: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 137\nSTEVEN: That was easy.\nMONK: It’s all about picking the right man at the right moment, my boy.\nVICKI: So if you hadn’t talked to him, he’d have done as he was told?\nMONK: Yes — the result being that he’d have had to conquer Italy all over again ten years later. Lots of people dying for no reason.\nSTEVEN: We’ve done well then.\nMONK: Indeed we have. But now we need to smooth things over with the Emperor Justinian, make sure he accepts Belisarius’ decision. If we’re going to create a Roman Empire that never fell...\nVICKI: Never fell?\nMONK: Oh yes. I mean, all empires have to fall eventually, but imagine if we could make one last... maybe even into your era.\nSTEVEN: I still don’t understand, Doctor — wouldn’t that change my past, and Vicki’s past?\nVICKI: Yes. I’m always worried that one day, we’ll sort of erase ourselves.\nMONK: I’ve told you, while you’re outside your proper place in the timestream, that can’t happen. You’d become a temporal anomaly. I do think of these things, you know.\nVICKI: Of course you do.\nMONK: Come on — we’re making the universe a better place!\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 138\nYAZID: . I’m a busy man, you know.\nSOPHIA: I’m sorry. If you want to get back to work, I can manage up here.\nYAZID: No no, I’m not leaving anyone unsupervised in the imperial box. I dunno why this ends up being my job though, bringing weird [foreign —]\nSOPHIA: A hole.\nYAZID: Hole? No, the structure’s completely sound.\nSOPHIA: Not in the structure, just... in the air.\nYAZID: The air? You’re insane.\nSOPHIA: Like... a tear in space.\nYAZID: But there’s nothing there.\nSOPHIA: There is! If I just reach out and — pull...!\nSOUND: AS WHEN THE DOCTOR VANISHED AND SOPHIA WAS HOLDING THE\nTIMELINE: OPEN.\nYAZID: A hole..! (BEAT) You’ve made a hole in the Emperor’s box!\nSOPHIA: Ssh. There’s someone inside. (INTO HOLE) Who’s there?\nYAZID: I’ve had enough of this. You’re leaving — now.\nYAZID: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 139\nSOPHIA: No, there’s someone in there! Someone who’s gone missing from the world —\nYAZID: You’re the one who’s gone missing from the world, sweetheart.\nYAZID: TOWARDS THE HOLE, GETTING LOUDER.\nDOCTOR: Look out beloooooo000ow-! [ETC]\nSOPHIA: There he is! I can see him! Look out, he’s falling —\nSOPHIA: HEAVILY, ON THE STONE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: Oof!\nYAZID: How... how did you do that?\nSOPHIA: I don’t know.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP) Bit of a bump. Nonetheless — thank you, Sophia.\nSOPHIA: How do you know my — Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Or, at least.. I was. Hello, Yazid — I thought you were dead.\nYAZID: (BACKING AWAY) A devil! A demon! A Persian demon!\nSOPHIA: (TO DOCTOR) I... I do know you. From my dreams.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nSOPHIA: Stay away from me -\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 140\nDOCTOR: No — wait! Sophia: I need your help.\nSOPHIA: Quintus told me about you. How you killed millions of people — killed the person he cared about the most —\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what he was talking about. But I do know you can’t trust him.\nSOPHIA: Why are you here?\nDOCTOR: Sophia, your dreams are true. It’s this world that’s fantasy. History has changed — you remember the world as it was meant to be.\nSOPHIA: Yes. And now it’s all gone wrong. I can feel the future... and every time I think of it, I feel sick with fear.\nDOCTOR: That’s what your friend Quintus did. I know him as the Monk. Look, I can’t prove anything I say, but I’m asking you to help me put it right. Come on, let’s get out of the Hippodrome.\nCROSS TO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 141\nDOCTOR: So the chariot race isn’t for another six days?\nSOPHIA: No.\nDOCTOR: You've released me from my prison before I ever went in. Is that even possible? Maybe I shouldn’t ask.\nSOPHIA: In my dreams, Quintus told me I’m something called a Time Sensitive.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’re only half human, Sophia. To judge from your abilities, the other half is from a species known as the Hetridon (HETRYdon).\nSOPHIA: Hetridon.\nDOCTOR: They have a rare talent — they know when the timelines have been altered. They can even open a hole in space-time if there’s a weakness in the fabric - just like you can. Even the Time Lords can’t do that — well, not without technology.\nSOPHIA: Yes! And... I did it, didn’t I? I let Quintus take your place. I’m so sorry.\nDOCTOR: I’m not going to hold you responsible for actions taken in a redundant timeline that never happened.\nSOPHIA: He told me you’d done awful things.\nDOCTOR: The Monk? I think he might even believe that himself. Just before I vanished he was almost incoherent. — I wonder what\nDOCTOR: happened to make him like that?\nSOPHIA: Something that happened in the past?\nSOPHIA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 142\nDOCTOR: In my future, apparently. — Anyway: now, the Monk is me and he always has been. I’d hoped the Time Lords might realise what happened and pull me out, but the Monk seems to have covered his tracks too well. Nobody knows the timelines have changed. Except us. Thank you for finding me.\nSOPHIA: Thank you. For the first time in my life, things make sense. You’ve been in my dreams several times — you had different faces, I thought it was just because that’s what happens in dreams.\nDOCTOR: No no, I have had different faces.\nSOPHIA: The Monk took me to an island in the future — he was sure you were going to make a different choice, but your friend stopped you...\nSOPHIA: And then, on another world, with metal monsters —\nSOPHIA: He was furious — said you always seemed to worm your way out of any Situation, however impossible...\nDOCTOR: No — don’t tell me, this is all in my future. But then he brought you back here?\nSOPHIA: Yes. The trap in Constantinople was the first one he set up — the others were sort of practice runs for this.\nDOCTOR: We need to undo it.\nSOPHIA: How?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know yet. But by the time the Monk gets here, I’1l have thought of something.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 143\nMONK: . Of course, one day all this will be Istanbul, not Constantinople... (NB: NO HINT OF SINGING) .. but who knows, if\nMONK: all this works maybe it won’t ever be Istanbul. Imagine that!\nVICKI: (LOOKING AROUND) Wow!\nSTEVEN: It is pretty impressive.\nMONK: You’re seeing it arguably at its peak. A lot of it doesn’t exist by your time.\nVICKI: Maybe we could do something about that?\nMONK: Indeed. Introduce the concept of a listed building fourteen hundred years early! The Hippodrome — now that would be a thing to preserve.\nSTEVEN: I’m glad you know what you’re doing, Doctor. Imagine the mess if you didn’t.\nMONK: Yes, quite! Now, we’ve got work to do — I will seek an audience with the Emperor —\nVICKI: Yes, of course you get to do that part.\nMONK: And you two have an appointment at the Basilica Cistern. We shall meet back at the TARDIS.\nSTEVEN: On the ship?\nMONK: No, I’ll get the sailors to wheel it over to the Hippodrome. Go on — shoo, shoo!\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 144\nJUSTINIAN: Ah yes, Doctor — you were mentioned in the missive from Belisarius. He was most complimentary.\nMONK: I’m honoured, your majesty. And your general’s courage and commitment to the restoration of the Empire is an inspiration.\nJUSTINIAN: Of course it is.\nMONK: I know he was gravely concerned that you might be displeased.\nJUSTINIAN: Displeased?\nMONK: Yes yes, by his failure to complete the campaign in Italy.\nJUSTINIAN: Oh. No no, we understand that completing the conquest will take time, but the threat from Persia [is grave —]\nMONK: Your majesty.. have you considered that your spies in Persia may simply be trying to justify their own position, by exaggerating the threat?\nJUSTINIAN: You think they would?\nMONK: Your majesty, no effort from either side to conquer the other has met with success. Why would they waste their resources on a new, and no doubt vain, effort at this point?\nJUSTINIAN: But if they do... I’m concerned about letting our army become entrenched in Italy. We could be caught entirely unprepared.\nMONK: Aha. What if I told you I could furnish you with a gift that would enable you to bargain for peace with any enemy?\nJUSTINIAN: (BEAT) I would very much be interested in that.\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 145\nMONK: I thought you might.\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 146\nVICKI: It’s this column.\nSTEVEN: You’re sure?\nVICKI: The Doctor’s instructions are very clear, it’s this one right at the back and the one next to it.\nSTEVEN: Oh, yes.\nVICKI: Yes, you see? You can see the heads at the bottom of the column.\nSTEVEN: So what are they?\nVICKI: The Doctor says they’re alien beings. Called the Ostardi.\nSTEVEN: They look like old lumps of stone.\nVICKI: They were turned to stone to imprison them.\nSTEVEN: And we're going to set them free?\nVICKI: It’s all part of the Doctor’s plan. We set them free, they’1ll go after the Emperor and Empress and, well.. take them over.\nSTEVEN: Take them over completely?\nVICKI: I assume so. The Doctor says the Emperor and Empress aren’t nice people — this will change a lot of things for the better.\nSTEVEN: Well, OK — I trust the Doctor, so... better get on with it.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson\nVICKI: Page 147\nVICKI: Right... (CLEAR THROAT) Rynesh Quesh Ath Wentesh. Thyben Quesh\nVICKI: Ash. (PAUSE) Did that sound right to you?\nSTEVEN: It sounded Welsh to me.\nVICKI: Does that mean it’s working?\nSTEVEN: I hope so.\nVICKI: The Doctor didn’t seem to think this would be dangerous...\nSTEVEN: I’m not sure the Doctor’s definition of ‘dangerous’ is exactly\nSTEVEN: the same as mine.\nVICKI: Hold onto the boat!\nSTEVEN: Wow.\nVICKI: OK. Er... go and.. do your thing.\nOSTARDI: #1 You.\nSTEVEN: What about us?\nOSTARDI: #2 We are looking for you.\nSTEVEN: No no, it’s not us... you’re meant to go after the Emperor and\nSTEVEN: Empress.\nOSTARDI: #1 (LOOMING CLOSER; LOUDER) No. You.\nVICKI: Steven!!\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 148\nMONK: I firmly believe, you see, that the Roman Empire can once again be great.\nJUSTINIAN: Are you saying it isn’t great now?\nMONK: (BEAT) I merely meant, your majesty, that all these divisions across Europe can be eradicated. The old Western Empire reunited with the East. Dare I say, the whole world might be yours.\nJUSTINIAN: The whole world...\nMONK: And other worlds beyond this one.\nJUSTINIAN: Others?\nMONK: Why not? Imagine Roman spaceships. Imagine how cool they’d look.\nJUSTINIAN: What’s happening?\nMONK: Ah, your majesty — don’t panic. This is all part of my plan.\nTHEODORA: Beloved!\nJUSTINIAN: Theodora — what is going on out there?\nTHEODORA: We are invaded by... by.. I don’t know what they are. Unearthly beings!\nJUSTINIAN: What have you brought upon us?\nJUSTINIAN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 149\nMONK: Please please, be calm! I promised you power and the security of your city, and I present the means by [which —]\nANTOIM: #1 (OFF) The Doctor.\nANTOIM: #2 (OFF) He said we would find you here.\nMONK: Oh.\nTHEODORA: What’s the matter?\nMONK: These, er.. aren’t the unearthly beings I was expecting.\nJUSTINIAN: What are they then?\nMONK: Some... people... I may have annoyed. Bye.\nTHEODORA: Where are you going?\nJUSTINIAN: Doctor!\nANTOIM: #1 Doctor!\nANTOIM: #2 Doctor!\nANTOIM: #1 It is the Doctor!\nTHEODORA: Look out!\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 150\nJUSTINIAN: Are you all right, beloved?\nTHEODORA: This isn’t a dream, is it?\nTHEODORA: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 151\nMONK: One side, please! Out of the way!\nMONK: (TO HIMSELF) What?! Where is it? I distinctly told them to leave the TARDIS here. (RAISES VOICE) Has anyone seen a box? blue box with —\nSTEVEN: (OFF) Doctor!\nVICKI: (OFF) Over here! Quickly!\nMONK: Aha!\nMONK: Steven. Vicki. Well done.\nVICKI: What’s happening, Doctor?\nMONK: Small change of plan. We’re leaving.\nSTEVEN: Leaving?!\nMONK: Inside!\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 152\nSTEVEN: Why are we leaving in such a hurry?\nMONK: Remember the Antoim? How they chased us off their planet and swore they’d track us down and how I said they’d never track us down because they were a stupid species and that in any case they lived half a galaxy away from Earth and four thousand years into the future.\nSTEVEN: Ye-es.\nMONK: Well, they’ve tracked us down.\nVICKI: What?! How?\nMONK: They must have got lucky. Time to go.\nVICKI: Hang on! We can’t just leave them on Earth, Doctor!\nMONK: Oh, Earth will be fine, it’s me they want. Probably. So! Let’s get out of —\nRESPONSE: IS A ‘THUNK’.\nMONK: Oh.\nSTEVEN: What’s the matter?\nMONK: The TARDIS won’t take off.\nVICKI: Oh. Perhaps it’s because I removed this?\nMONK: But... that’s the dematerialisation circuit. Give me —\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 153\nVICKI: Don’t snatch, it’s not polite.\nMONK: Why did you remove that, you meddling —\nDOCTOR: Because I told her to.\nMONK: You.. no, you don’t exist. I had you wiped from time and space itself! I’ve been living your life for seven hundred and fifty — You don’t... you can’t exist!\nDOCTOR: And yet here I am.\nMONK: Wh... where did you come from?\nDOCTOR: Steven and Vicki let me in.\nMONK: But... they shouldn’t even know who you are. They don’t remember you — I’m the Doctor as far as they’re concerned.\nDOCTOR: Strictly speaking, they’re not Steven and Vicki, you see.\nSTEVEN: We are the Ostardi.\nMONK: But.. no no, you were supposed to take control of Justinian and Theodora, not the Doctor’s companions.\nDOCTOR: I might have woken the Ostardi up a little early and had a little chat with them, then put them back to sleep.\nVICKI: We came here to cure.\nSTEVEN: But the Doctor told us you used us.\nSTEVEN: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 154\nVICKI: Used us to change things for your own gain.\nMONK: No! It wasn’t like that — I wanted only to... to...\nDOCTOR: Aha. Time for another blast from the past - or do I mean the future?\nSOPHIA: Hello. Remember me?\nMONK: Sophia. Close the door! They’re out there!\nDOCTOR: Are they out there, Sophia?\nSOPHIA: They’re looking for him now. It won’t be long.\nMONK: We’ve got to get away —\nDOCTOR: We don’t have to. You have to. It’s you they want, because apparently you’re the Doctor.\nMONK: How did you escape? (TO SOPHIA) Sophia? Did you do this?\nSOPHIA: I remembered you. I came looking for you.\nDOCTOR: But she didn’t find you, she found me. It never occurred to you that she might care what had happened to you, did it?\nMONK: I’m better at being you than you ever were. I’m building a better Earth, a better galaxy, a better universe!\nDOCTOR: And I suppose you’ve convinced Steven and Vicki and all my other friends to help you, convinced them your way is fine?\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 155\nSOPHIA: I’ve seen the future you’re creating. It’s a disaster.\nMONK: Then I’1l go back again and fix it. Or not! Whatever I do, whatever I change, the universe will eventually dissipate into nothingness anyway, so it literally makes no difference.\nDOCTOR: The difference is the countless lives of the people who have to live here in the meantime.\nMONK: There’s nothing you can do, Doctor. Sophia can’t pull me out, there’s no weak point in the timelines here, so.. what, are you going threaten to kill me? If you do that, you’1ll never get back.\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not going to threaten to kill you.\nMONK: Good.\nDOCTOR: I’m just going to throw you out of the TARDIS and leave you at the mercy of the Antoim.\nMONK: What?\nDOCTOR: Steven? Vicki? Sophia? Could you help?\nSTEVEN: Of course.\nMONK: No! Let me go...!\nCONTINUES INTO: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 156\nCONTINUES INTO: SOPHIA.\nMONK: No! Doctor — don’t do this!\nDOCTOR: I thought you were the Doctor.\nMONK: But the Antoim are coming. They’1l find me.\nDOCTOR: I hope so, it was me who told them where you were.\nMONK: What?\nDOCTOR: Yes, they were desperate for revenge on the Doctor, so I found your TARDIS — which was just hanging around abandoned in a corner of the city, another little temporal anomaly — and nipped over to their planet, and told them where they could find a wormhole that would take them straight to you.\nANTOIM: #1 (DISTANT - AT FAR END OF ALLEYWAY) The blue capsule!\nANTOIM: #2 (DITTO) It is the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Here they come. — Now, I’m sure you wouldn’t have hijacked my timeline without an escape route back to your own, just in case you got out of your depth.\nMONK: I... maybe.\nDOCTOR: In fact, I’d be willing to bet you’ve got your finger on it right now in your pocket.\nMONK: Maybe.\nDOCTOR: So when you leave my timeline, with Sophia’s help, I’1l be able to return to it.\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 157\nMONK: And the Antoim will kill you instead.\nDOCTOR: I’1l think of something.\nMONK: Tell me how to beat them!\nDOCTOR: No.\nMONK: Tell me — or you’ll never get your life back!\nDOCTOR: No.\nANTOIM: #1 The Doctor!\nANTOIM: #2 It is the Doctor!\nANTOIM: #1 Destroy him!\nMONK: (TO DOCTOR) All right! You win! You be the Doctor, if you love yourself so much!\nMONK: NOISE.\nDOCTOR: Sophia?\nSOPHIA: It’s open, Doctor! You may exchange timelines.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now!\nDOCTOR: TIMELINE.\nMONK: Is that... it?\nMONK: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 158\nDOCTOR: Now you’re me, and I’m you. Or rather, I’m me, and you’re you. Oh... never mind.\nANTOIM: #1 You are the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes I am.\nANTOIM: #2 You will be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: Before you do that, Antoim — a few decades after we last met, I had a sudden thought. The world where we encountered you — I remember detecting some odd energy fluctuations there. In fact we had trouble landing the TARDIS. I realised what was causing it — dimensional instability. And that’s why I rigged up the device that Sophia here is holding, using this dimensional unit.\nMONK: You stole that from my TARDIS.\nSOPHIA: Yes, we did. Now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: If you don’t mind.\nNEXT: LINE FADING QUICKLY.\nANTOIM: #1 No! We cannot be defeated so...\nMONK: Where did they go?\nDOCTOR: The Antoim were an intelligent virus. The dimensional instability they passed through made them expand, thousands of times larger than they should have been. I’ve reversed the effect — they’re still there, you just can’t see them.\nSTEVEN: We've assessed the disease.\nVICKI: The antibody has been generated.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 159\nSTEVEN: Releasing it now.\nSTEVEN: SCENE OF EP 3.\nSOPHIA: Is that it? You’ve dealt with them?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well done, everybody.\nMONK: Yes, good work, I’1l be off now then —\nSTEVEN: No.\nVICKI: No.\nSTEVEN: We don’t appreciate being manipulated.\nMONK: (BLUSTERING) Manipulated? Never! I gave you a chance to cure disease! Isn’t that what you live for?\nVICKI: Not at the Doctor’s expense.\nSTEVEN: We'll return your friends to you, Doctor.\nSTONE: HEADS NOW REAPPEARING.\nSTEVEN: & VICKI\nOSTARDI: #1 We are going home.\nOSTARDI: #2 And taking you with us... “Monk”.\nMONK: No — no!\nOSTARDI: #1 Put him in an isolation bubble.\nOSTARDI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 160\nOSTARDI: #2 Yes.\nMONK: (MUFFLED) No! I’1ll get free, Doctor. And then I’1l come back,\nMONK: and I’1l undo all this!\nOSTARDI: #1 Goodbye, Doctor.\nMONK: (MUFFLED) I’ve done it before! You don’t know how many times.\nMONK: If at first you don’t succeed, try try ag—\nSOPHIA: They’ve gone.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And I hope they behave themselves this time. I gave strict talking-to about meddling in the affairs of other species.\nVICKI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Vicki! Good to have you back.\nSTEVEN: Back? We haven’t been anywhere.\nDOCTOR: And you know it’s me, then?\nSTEVEN: them a\nSTEVEN: Yes, yes — we established this at the start. You look different\nSTEVEN: but you are the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now. We may have a little tidying-up to do. Make sure the\nDOCTOR: Monk hasn’t done any [permanent —]\nSTEVEN: The Monk?\nVICKI: The Monk Monk? He was here?\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 161\nDOCTOR: Yes. Although possibly not, now. Maybe he was never here. These things are always messy.\nSTEVEN: What things? I’ve no idea what’s been happening.\nSOPHIA: Doctor — my sense of the future — it seems better now.\nDOCTOR: Good. Well that’s something at least.\nSOPHIA: Better, but not perfect.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s never perfect. Nor should it be. Perfection’s rather overrated if you ask me. (BEAT) So what now? You can come with us if you like.\nSOPHIA: Thank you, but.. no.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? It’s going to be hard here, you know. The plague will come, if history’s back on the right lines. And Justinian’s reign becomes more and more troubled.\nSOPHIA: I know. But I feel like I can help.\nDOCTOR: I think so too. So nice to have met you, Sophia. Goodbye.\nSTEVEN: Are we leaving?\nDOCTOR: Yes, why?\nVICKI: We only just got here.\nVICKI: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 162\nSTEVEN: What is going on, Doctor?\nVICKI: Yes. I wanted to see Constantinople.\nDOCTOR: You will. I’m afraid we need to go through all this again and make sure the Monk’s interference hasn’t changed anything, make sure Belisarius comes back from Ravenna like he should, so we need to head back there.\nSTEVEN: Back where?\nDOCTOR: Ravenna.\nVICKI: Where’s Ravenna? I’ve never been to Ravenna before.\nSTEVEN: Me neither. In fact I’ve never even heard of it before.\nDOCTOR: And you don’t remember Procopius? Belisarius?\nVICKI: Should we? And who was that woman out there?\nDOCTOR: Good grief. None of it ever happened. Which means when we land there again... we’ll never have been there before.\nVICKI: Steven, look — the Doctor!\nSTEVEN: He's fading away!\nDOCTOR: (FADING AWAY) Oh. Yes. Being drawn back to my own place in the timestream. Don’t worry — Steven, Vicki. Your Doctor will return, and... everything will be as it should have been. I might seem a little different, but deep down... I’m always the same...\nDOCTOR: THE SECRET HISTORY by Eddie Robson Page 163\nDOCTOR: WRITTEN.\nPROCOPIUS: The time has come in my history to relate the episode of Belisarius’ retreat from Ravenna. My general was not minded to return as Justinian requested, but he was convinced by the words of an aged and white-haired traveller, the Doctor, who appealed to Belisarius’ vanity. The Doctor and his young companion accompanied us upon our return to Constantinople, seeking another of their party from whom they had become separated, and on their arrival embroiled me in a most peculiar scheme to replace the Medusa heads at the bases of two columns in the Basilica Cistern — which had, unaccountably, vanished — with two identical heads. (HE PUTS QUILL TO PARCHMENT, TO\nCONTINUE HIS TALE. SLOWLY: ) This involved deceiving Justinian in the most elaborate — (BREAKS OFF WRITING) Oh, no, no, no...\nPROCOPIUS: I think perhaps some histories should remain... secret.\nDOCTOR: WHO MUSIC.\nDOCTOR: END"
