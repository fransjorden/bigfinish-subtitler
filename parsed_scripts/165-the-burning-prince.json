I was told you might be in the lab. We came out of warpstream a few minutes ago.

Sorry, Ambassador.\nTUVOLD: That’s quite alright, your highness.\nSHIRA: Well let’s not waste any more time.\nKYLO: Can I get a glass of water?\nSHIRA: (BEAT. UNIMPRESSED) Yes. That’s the food dispenser.\nSHIRA: (KYLO GOES TO A FOOD MACHINE UNDER, PRESSES SOME BUTTONS AND IS\nVENTED: SOME WATER IN A GLASS. SHIRA PRESSES SOME BUTTONS IN THE FOREGROUND. A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY BUZZES INTO LIFE)\nVENTED: There we are, gentlemen. Sharnax. Our destination.\nTUVOLD: Right. Uninspiring, isn’t it?\nSHIRA: You'd never think such a nondescript planetoid would cause so much trouble. Still. It’s the little stuff you overlook that gets you in the end. Now we’re close we’ve been able to establish a firmer location trace. The beacon signal’s transmitting from this spot here. Quite a lot of the planet’s marshland, but that bit’s firm enough. Should be able to drop a lander pretty close.\nTUVOLD: If it’s firm ground there’s less chance of survivors, surely.\nSHIRA: Depends whether they had time to launch a life raft. We won’t know for sure until we check. (SHE PRESSES SOME BUTTONS, THE\nHOLOGRAM: FADES) The good news is this means we can send all the troops. They’re prepping their bows. I’m leading the landing party.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 11\nTUVOLD: You are?\nSHIRA: Corwyn’s perfectly capable of command if anything goes wrong.\nKYLO: When do we leave?\nSHIRA: We?\nKYLO: I’m coming with you.\nSHIRA: No, your highness. No, you’re not.\nKYLO: But... I’ve got to go. This is my betrothed - .\nSHIRA: Yes. And if we rescue her I’m sure she’d like a husband to come back to.\nKYLO: I’m the heir to the Royal House of Sorsha. Your ruling family. I order you to take me with you.\nSHIRA: You don’t have jurisdiction on my ship, your highness. It’s my command, a military command. I order you. Keeping you informed’s a courtesy, not an obligation. I was letting you know the state of play, it wasn’t an invitation.\nKYLO: Lead from the front, you said —\nSHIRA: You’re staying here. I’m sorry.\nSHIRA: Shira.\nRIGA: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) Captain, this is Riga. We’ve a report from one of the troopers. He’s found a stowaway.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 12\nSHIRA: What? Where?\nRIGA: (DISTORT) Armoury three annexe. He’s in the brig.\nSHIRA: (BEAT) Thank you Pilot, Shira out.\nTUVOLD: A stowaway?\nSHIRA: A seemingly suicidal one, this is hardly a pleasure cruise. With me, Ambassador. This might have political ramifications.\nTUVOLD: Er... yes.\nKYLO: And me?\nSHIRA: You’re staying here.\nKYLO: (BEAT. SUDDEN INTENSITY) Why does everyone treat me as if I’m made out of glass?\nSHIRA: I’m sorry, your highness, but I’ve got to keep you safe. This man’s potentially dangerous, we can’t risk your life.\nKYLO: I don’t need to be coddled, I’m not a fool!\nSHIRA: No one thinks you are. But your father’s lost two sons, I doubt he’d care to lose another. I’m sorry. Ambassador.\nTUVOLD: Captain.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 13\nKYLO: Idiot woman. Telling me what to do. Who does she think she is?!\nKYLO: Just you wait, Shira Calanah. Just you - (SUDDEN PAIN) Ah!\nKYLO: The water — it.. it boiled, I... oh no. NO!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: So this is a sort of space-faring feudalistic society, is it?\nTYRON: Quiet.\nDOCTOR: Must be, what, thirty of you on board? Er, do you mind not pointing that arrow at my head, it’s awfully disconcerting...\nSHIRA: That must be him.\nTUVOLD: Apparently so.\nDOCTOR: Are all your weapons derived from bowstring armaments or do you have any more conventional projectile weaponry...?\nTYRON: I said quiet!\nDOCTOR: Well, you were the one that insisted on dragging me up here. If you didn’t want a conversation, why on Earth did you keep me around?\nTYRON: Now look here — !\nSHIRA: At ease, trooper.\nTYRON: (BEAT) Ma’am.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and just when we’d broken the ice too.\nSHIRA: Is this the intruder?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: What tipped you off? You must be the Captain. Shira, wasn’t it? (SHAKES HER HAND) That’s what this gentleman here called you. I’m the Doctor. How do you do?\nSHIRA: How do I do what?\nDOCTOR: Well... (BEAT) You know I’ve honestly no idea.\nSHIRA: Tyron, isn’t it, Trooper?\nTYRON: Yes, ma’am.\nSHIRA: Talk to me, Tyron.\nTYRON: He’s a spy, ma’am.\nDOCTOR: Oh not again. Why do they always go for ‘spy’?\nTYRON: We found him in the armoury three annexe.\nDOCTOR: Technically, I found you.\nTYRON: Whatever. We were getting ready and he was there. Spying. Must be Gadarel.\nTUVOLD: What?\nDOCTOR: Oh for goodness’ — Look, I am not working for anyone. I told you. I’m not a spy. I am never a spy. A spy would ask questions, find out troop numbers, make all manner of enquiries about the weapons you’ve got on board, etcetera, etcetera and I’m not doing myself any favours, am I?\nSHIRA: No.\nDOCTOR: I’1l shut up now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 16\nSHIRA: Well, Ambassador?\nTUVOLD: He’s nothing to do with me, I’ve never seen him before in my life.\nSHIRA: (DRILY) Because if he was a spy you’d admit it immediately.\nTUVOLD: Captain, why would we smuggle someone on board? I’m here. What could he learn undercover I couldn’t find out legitimately?\nSHIRA: Relax, Tuvold. No, I don’t think he’s a spy.\nDOCTOR: At last, someone who listens.\nSHIRA: I think he’s a saboteur.\nDOCTOR: Brilliant.\nSHIRA: He was found near armoury three, Ambassador. That’s where we keep the flare charges. One of those could blast a hole half a mile long in the side of this ship, two’d take us out of the sky.\nTUVOLD: A bomb?\nSHIRA: Not everyone from House Gadarel supports the peace initiative and the marriage, you must know that.\nTUVOLD: Not everyone from House Sorsha either.\nSHIRA: I’m by no means ruling us out. There’s plenty on both sides who’d do anything to see this mission fail.\nTUVOLD: Including kill the heir to their own throne?\nSHIRA: Lose the battle, win the war. Somebody brought Aliona’s ship down, remember.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: Er, if I might be permitted to make a suggestion?\nSHIRA: (BEAT) Yes?\nDOCTOR: Look, I’m sure this is a fascinating discussion, but it is all rather academic. I’m not a spy or a saboteur, a Sorsha or Gadarel, whatever they are, I’m a traveller. A simple traveller, a wanderer in the stars. I arrived here by accident no more than ten minutes ago. This is honestly a misunderstanding.\nSHIRA: A wanderer in the stars?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nSHIRA: Who happened to wander into the armoury of a military transport vessel? It’s a bit off the tourist track, you’ll forgive me if I find the concept hard to believe.\nDOCTOR: Well, it wasn’t deliberate, obviously. I have a transport capsule, it can be a trifle... wilful at times, you can’t always be sure where you’re going to end up. I was actually heading for Amsterdam.\nTUVOLD: Where?\nDOCTOR: Amsterdam, Holland, that’s not important right now, look, what say I take you down to, um.. the annexe, that’s what you called it, wasn’t it Tyron?\nTYRON: What?\nDOCTOR: The annexe, yes. Why don’t I take you down to the annexe, I can show you my travel capsule. It is all totally innocent, I promise you.\nSHIRA: Very well.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 18\nTUVOLD: You’re not going?\nTYRON: Could be a trap, ma’am.\nSHIRA: Well, of course it could be a trap, that’s the point. Want to see what your enemy’s planning, sometimes you’ve got to spring them. Alright, ‘Doctor’. I’m willing to take you at your word.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nSHIRA: Tuvold, let Corwyn know what’s happening.\nTUVOLD: You don’t want me with you?\nSHIRA: We're already dealing with one interplanetary incident, Ambassador, we could do without another. Tyron can keep him under guard.\nTYRON: Ma’am.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’1l1 be no trouble.\nSHIRA: You’d better not. Alright then, ‘wanderer’. Lead the way!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: (GENERAL MARINE CHAT IN THE BACKGROUND:\nMARINES: Right, come on everyone, we’ve got ten minutes, we need to be ready in ten minutes. —\nMARINES: How many arrowbolts we gonna need?\nMARINES: Watch it, don’t point that at me when it’s loaded. —\nMARINES: Get your ugly mug out of my face. —\nMARINES: (..

It’s a rescue mission, isn’t it?\nTYRON: Quiet!\nSHIRA: Let him speak. Doctor, for someone who claims they’re not a spy, you’re certainly paying attention.\nDOCTOR: Well, I do like to keep my ears open.\nSHIRA: You really don’t know?\nDOCTOR: I really don’t.\nSHIRA: (BEAT) Call me insane, but I’m almost beginning to believe you.\nDOCTOR: I have that effect on most people. You said something about a downed ship. Aliona’s?\nSHIRA: Yes. Princess Aliona. Her wedding galley.\nDOCTOR: Her — Of course. The peace initiative and the marriage. With Houses Sorsha and Gadarel as the happy couple.\nSHIRA: She’s marrying Prince Kylo of the Sorsha. If you really only did arrive in this sector ten minutes ago, you pick things up remarkably quickly.\nDOCTOR: What can I say, it’s a gift. You’re trying to unite two feuding families.\nSHIRA: That’s right.\nDOCTOR: Royal Families, no less. A battle for the crown?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 22\nSHIRA: (BEAT) You are good aren’t you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, one doesn’t like to boast.\nSHIRA: The Gadarel and the Sorsha have been at war since the mad Emperor was deposed decades ago. The heads of both houses claim dominion over the Drashani empire.\nDOCTOR: But of course they do, the Drashani empire. So that’s where we are.\nSHIRA: You know it?\nDOCTOR: Only by reputation.\nSHIRA: What’s its reputation?\nDOCTOR: A galaxy-spanning civilisation to rival Earth’s. The glory of Rome set among the stars. You know, I’ve never been here before, how fascinating.\nSHIRA: Rome?\nSHIRA: (AS THEY MOVE, WE BEGIN TO HEAR THE BATTLE IN THE CREW ROOM\nDISTANTLY: AHEAD)\nDOCTOR: So to create a peace, marriage is brokered between the houses.\nSHIRA: Valdarn Gadarel was gaining the upper hand but he was killed in battle a few months back. His daughter’s sole heir and she’s got a far less warlike temperament. And far less design for power.\nDOCTOR: Two families ruling as one. Well, it’s worked before, it’s a classic gambit.\nSHIRA: (DISTRACTED) Can you hear that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: But it’s all threatened when one of the affianced parties is lost, so to speak, at sea. Yes, I can quite see why you’d be in a hurry to get her back...\nSHIRA: What now?\nSHIRA: (SHE OPENS A CHANNEL. NOISE OF THE SLAUGHTER AND BOWFIGHT UP\nAHEAD: FILTERS THROUGH)\nBANDAK: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) Captain! Captain Shira, this is Trooper Bandak, this is an emergency, the Igris is out, I repeat, the Igris is — Aagh!\nSHIRA: Bandak? Come in! Bandak?\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nSHIRA: It came from the crew room! COME ON!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE SOUNDS OF WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER INSIDE THE CREW ROOM. SCREAMS. ARROWS. ETC)\nDOCTOR: Oh, no.\nSHIRA: It’s spotted us! Tyron, open fire, keep it back.\nTYRON: Ma’am!\nTYRON: (HE LAUNCHES OFF ARROW AFTER ARROW WITH HIS AUTOMATIC LONGBOW.\nSHIRA: HITTING CONTROLS )\nSHIRA: Come on, come on, locking code.\nSHIRA: Right, get back, retreat, that won’t last long...\nSHIRA: (A HEAVY THUD FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR. SHIRA, TYRON AND THE DOCTOR RETREAT )\nDOCTOR: But... but there were people in there!\nSHIRA: They’re dead. Let’s not join them. Come on! (SHE OPERATES COMMUNICATOR)\nTYRON: It’ll be through any second.\nSHIRA: I know. (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Corwyn? Corwyn, come in, Corwyn.\nCORWYN: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) Ma’am?\nSHIRA: The Igris is out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 25\nCORWYN: (DISTORT) The Igris? How?\nSHIRA: Does it matter how? It’s out.\nSHIRA: (THE DOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR IS SMASHED APART. THE IGRIS STEPS THROUGH GROWLING)\nTYRON: Captain!\nSHIRA: Open fire!\nDOCTOR: What is that thing?\nTYRON: I ain’t stopping it!\nSHIRA: Just need to keep it back. Corwyn! Send squads two and three to corridor C12.\nCORWYN: (DISTORT) What about squad one, they’re closer?\nSHIRA: Yes, but they’re dead, Corwyn, they’re all dead! All remaining troops to corridor C12. (TO TYRON) Get behind the door, trooper.\nDOCTOR: Is this one going to hold any better?\nSHIRA: Take a wild guess. (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Get Altus, Corwyn. I want his research. I want to know how to stop that thing!\nCORWYN: (DISTORT) Ma’am.\nSHIRA: And hurry, there’s only so many bulkheads between us and the flight deck!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: What is that, Captain, an ‘Igris’?\nSHIRA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: What’s an Igris?\nSHIRA: An unstoppable killing machine.\nDOCTOR: I see. And how it did one get on board?\nSHIRA: How d’you think? We brought it.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSHIRA: It’s a research tool. We’ve been trying to find a way of stopping them.\nDOCTOR: Well, that experiment’s going to be a rather more practical proposition now, then isn’t it?\nSHIRA: Open fire!\nTROOPER: Reinforcements Ma’am.\nSHIRA: Great. Open fire!\nSHIRA: (THE REINFORCEMENTS SHOOT AUTOMATIC LASERBOWS AT THE IGRIS. IT\nKEEPS: CLOSING, ROARING)\nTYRON: It’s closing.\nSHIRA: Maintain barrage! Keep it back as long as we can! Tyron. Take this man to the Bridge and stay with him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 27\nTYRON: What?\nDOCTOR: But I can help!\nSHIRA: You don’t know what we’re up against, Doctor, always assuming you didn’t let it out in the first place... Tyron, give me your bow —\nTYRON: It’s my job, Captain. Fall back.\nSHIRA: That’s an order, Trooper, follow it!\nTYRON: You. This way.\nDOCTOR: Right behind you.\nSHIRA: Keep firing!\nSHIRA: Alright, fall back! Fall back!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 28\nRIGA: Life signs seventeen. Sixteen.

Job in hand!\nKYLO: It’s killing the lot of them!\nCORWYN: You think I haven’t noticed? How long til we hit atmosphere?\nRIGA: (CHECKS A READING) Five minutes...\nKYLO: They’re dying!\nCORWYN: We’1ll be dead too if we can’t figure out how to stop that thing. Altus, talk to me.\nALTUS: There’s nothing that works on the move, Commander, it’s unstoppable.\nCORWYN: Don’t tell me that!\nALTUS: What do you want me to say?\nKYLO: They’re being slaughtered!\nTUVOLD: This is an atrocity, we have to do something!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 29\nCORWYN: We're trying to! (OPERATING A COMMUNICATOR) Captain this is Corwyn, there’s a negative from Altus, I repeat, a negative, I\nCORWYN: (TYRON AND THE DOCTOR ENTER, CORWYN SWITCHES OFF THE COMMUNICATOR)\nTYRON: Commander.\nCORWYN: Who’s — ?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor.\nTYRON: The stowaway!\nDOCTOR: Lost traveller, there’s a difference.\nCORWYN: You did this!\nDOCTOR: We don’t have time to discuss it! Open a communication channel\nDOCTOR: to Captain Shira!\nCORWYN: But —\nDOCTOR: Do it!\nDOCTOR: (CORWYN PRESSES BUTTONS. THE SOUND OF THE FIGHTING FILLS THE BRIDGE)\nDOCTOR: Captain? Captain Shira, are you there?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 30\nSHIRA: Doctor?

We had it behind a forcewall —\nDOCTOR: A force — Sorry, I don’t think we’ve been introduced, I’m the Doctor.\nKYLO: Kylo.\nDOCTOR: Oh, the Prince! Congratulations on the engagement. Hope the actual marriage goes more smoothly.\nRIGA: Three minutes to atmosphere.\nCORWYN: This isn’t helping!\nSHIRA: (DISTORT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course, sorry, got a bit distracted, sorry. You can stop it with forcefields, is that right?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 32\nSHIRA: Fire at will! (INTO COMMUNICATOR AS A VOLLEY EXPLODES ROUND HER, THEY FIRE AND RETREAT) Yes, but we can’t generate them in the corridors, we weren’t prepared for this!\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Where can you generate them? It’s following you, lure it there.\nSHIRA: (BEAT) The Armouries! It’s a failsafe if the ship’s boarded.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Can you get to one quickly?\nSHIRA: Yes, armoury three, where we were heading.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Then I suggest you get a move on.\nSHIRA: Point taken. Out. (SHE CUTS OFF THE COMMUNICATOR) You heard the\nSHIRA: man, armoury three!

We’re going to die!\nDOCTOR: We are not going to die! You, are you the Science officer?\nALTUS: Strictly speaking the medical officer, but I cover basic sciences, yes...\nDOCTOR: Thought so, you had the look. Can you generate the armoury forcewall remotely from up here?\nALTUS: I — I don’t know if I should be taking orders from a —\nCORWYN: Do it, Altus! If it’s possible, do it!\nALTUS: Er, then yes. Yes I can.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. So if you would.\nCORWYN: Doctor, what are you planning?\nDOCTOR: Explanations can wait, we don’t have the time. You. Tuvold, wasn’t it?\nTUVOLD: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Give him any help he needs.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 34\nTUVOLD: Very well.\nRIGA: Life signs five.

Trooper, operate priority override, one-one-five- nine.\nTROOPER: Ma’am.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) We can operate the forcewall from the bridge, you just need to lure it in and get out.\nSHIRA: Get inside, get to the back wall, we need it as far in as\nSHIRA: possible then we split and try to get round on the outside.\nTROOPER: Will that work?\nSHIRA: I really hope so.\nSHIRA: Right, in!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 36\nRIGA: Life signs four. One minute to atmosphere.\nDOCTOR: Are there any more troopers?\nCORWYN: Only Tyron. The rest are down there or dead.\nTYRON: I could head back.\nDOCTOR: You'd just be another corpse, Tyron, you’re more use to us here.\nKYLO: Please. For Aliona’s sake. We have to survive this!\nDOCTOR: That is the plan.\nSHIRA: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) I’m in, are you ready?\nDOCTOR: Altus, Tuvold?\nALTUS: Give me the word.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 37\nTUVOLD: (DISTORT, DISTANT) Whenever you want.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Everyone’s ready here.\nSHIRA: (QUIETLY) Come on.

Fifteen seconds!\nDOCTOR: The Alendra? Is that what it was called, I did wonder. Ride the impact wave when it hits, remember.\nRIGA: I’1ll do my best. (PAUSE) Five. Four.

This planet’s largely marshland? (BEAT) Well?\nCORWYN: Er... yes, yes, I’m pretty certain I remember that from the briefing —\nDOCTOR: Riga, if we dive this ship into a marsh, can we survive the impact?\nRIGA: Ah...\nDOCTOR: Quickly!\nRIGA: . well, if it’s deep enough, there’s a chance. Beats solid ground, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Make a scan of the local area, find the deepest, marshiest marsh you can find, head for that.\nRIGA: Slight problem.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nRIGA: This ship isn’t buoyant. It’s too heavy, it’1ll sink.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Ever get the feeling it’s not your day? Look, one thing at a time, Riga. Do the scan, if we survive the crash we can worry about drowning later.\nRIGA: Will do.\nCORWYN: You think this’1l work?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR: By all means feel free to suggest an alternative.\nRIGA: Got one!

That’1l draw their attention for a while, so going outside now shouldn’t be a problem. We’1ll need protection for when they get back. You were planning on coming down here, what method of defence had you in mind?\nDOCTOR: Commander?\nCORWYN: I...\nTYRON: The skimmer, sir, the skimmer. We were going to travel in it, it’s out back.\nDOCTOR: The what?\nALTUS: A low level flying tank.\nDOCTOR: A tank within a lander within an orbiter? Less a spaceship, more a Matryoshka doll...\nRIGA: It’s got it’s own forcewall, that’1ll keep them back.\nDOCTOR: Then I think we’ve found our way out of here. Good.\nCORWYN: It’s got limited defensive systems though. Small cache of weaponry, nothing more.\nDOCTOR: Even better.\nALTUS: Better?\nDOCTOR: We’re the invaders on this planet, the aggressors. It’s their world, we don’t have the right to wipe them out...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 63\nCORWYN: But —\nDOCTOR: It’s a point of principle, sorry.\nCORWYN: Ah, they’re practically impossible to kill anyway. Arrowbolts only push them back...\nDOCTOR: Good man.\nCORWYN: All right, everyone! Not a moment to lose. The skimmer! Quick as you can! Go!\nTYRON: Sir!\nRIGA: Sir!\nKYLO: Yes!\nTUVOLD: I’m too old for this...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 64\nRIGA: And unlocking.\nDOCTOR: Anyone else getting a sense of déja vu?\nRIGA: We’re in.

(BEAT) But you know what he did!\nDOCTOR: If he does, can he tell me, because I thought I just saved your lives.\nRIGA: There was a saboteur on the Alendra. Somebody let the Igris out, then shorted the energy fields, so no forcewall, now this.\nKYLO: This?\nRIGA: The lines were cut. I had to reroute the power, otherwise we’d\nRIGA: have drowned. You’re the stowaway, who else is it going to be, you’re a saboteur!\nCORWYN: Riga, no!\nDOCTOR: Will you —\nCORWYN: Tyron, get her off him!\nTYRON: Riga! Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 70\nRIGA: No, Tyron, what are you — let me — !\nTUVOLD: Riga, please, listen to me, you’re wrong, it can’t have been him, he was your prisoner, Tyron, remember!\nTYRON: Er.. yeah, he’s right, I’d got him in the brig, it can’t have\nTYRON: been him!\nRIGA: But —\nTYRON: It weren’t him!\nRIGA: It - ?\nTUVOLD: It can’t have been.\nRIGA: Then it was you!\nTUVOLD: What!\nRIGA: Has to be a Gadarel, who else is it going to be?\nCORWYN: Calm down, Pilot, I — !\nCORWYN: (HE STOPS.

But it’1ll do.\nALTUS: Good.\nTUVOLD: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Riga. These are dangerous circumstances we find ourselves in. I need you on side if we’re going to get through this.\nRIGA: (BEAT) Okay. I’m sorry. I mean, I’m still not sure I trust you but —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: That’s alright. An understandable misinterpretation of the facts, given the circumstances. But it can’t have been me. Tuvold, Tyron and I can vouch for each other.\nTUVOLD: Exactly. I was there all the time.\nCORWYN: You're saying it was accidental?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, no. It was deliberate. Someone was trying to stop your mission.\nKYLO: There was a saboteur?\nDOCTOR: I’d say so.\nKYLO: Someone wants me and my betrothed dead?\nALTUS: (WARNING) Your highness...\nDOCTOR: Only indirectly. I’d guess they were more concerned about stopping the peace initiative. Your deaths’d just be a good stepping stone towards achieving that.\nKYLO: One of you is trying to kill me?\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily. Whoever it is, they may have perished on the Alendra, it’s not like the Igris was easily directable...\nKYLO: This is —\nALTUS: Your highness, you need to keep calm...\nCORWYN: Doctor, that’s impossible. The crew all supported the peace initiative. We checked. Detailed psychological scans —\nDOCTOR: -that can be faked.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 75\nCORWYN: Not these. We couldn’t risk taking pro-war agitators on such a delicate mission, we’re not stupid.\nDOCTOR: Then who —\nCORWYN: They were cleared. We were all cleared.\nTUVOLD: It was an obligatory requirement before we allowed the mission.\nALTUS: I supervised the tests.\nDOCTOR: So no-one could have done it? That’s impossible, unless... unless they’re after something else...\nCORWYN: Enough!\nKYLO: But Commander — !\nCORWYN: This is pointless speculation. Maybe there was a saboteur, maybe it was a lot of accidents, I don’t know. All I know is I’ve a mission to complete and I don’t intend to delay it further by discussing hypotheticals.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Corwyn, but —\nCORWYN: We have a Princess to rescue and we are wasting time.\nKYLO: (BEAT) Yes. You’re right.\nCORWYN: That is our priority, nothing else. We find that downed ship\nCORWYN: now, that is an order, understood?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: Riga, get looking for the signal.\nRIGA: Commander.

(BEAT) What are you waiting for, MOVE!\nALTUS: Very well.\nDOCTOR: Such a charmer, isn’t he?\nTUVOLD: I’ve never warmed to the military.\nKYLO: We’re going to find her. I know we’re going to find her.\nKYLO: (THE SKIMMER SHUDDERS ALONG, SLOWLY. IGRIS WANDER AROUND, GROWLING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 77\nTUVOLD: Are they still there?\nDOCTOR: (STANDING) Well, it’s not as good a view as up top, so it’s got to be an estimate, but.. I’d say there’s in the region of four hundred Igris outside.\nTUVOLD: Wonderful.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSING A WINDOWSLIT) Could be worse, could be in the thousands. Mind you. Didn’t see the other side...\nTUVOLD: I wasn’t supposed to be down here, you know. No planetfall, that was the agreement. A purely diplomatic role. I’vea daughter, newly born, I should be at home, shouldn’t be dealing with those things.\nDOCTOR: What exactly are they?\nTUVOLD: The Igris? You don’t know?\nDOCTOR: Lost wanderer, remember?\nTUVOLD: (BEAT) They’re a genetically modified slave race. They were designed for mining and building and cheap labour on planets with difficult terrain or environments.\nDOCTOR: Ah, hence their impregnability. Sharp claws to cut away rock. Skin like iron to protect from heat and cold...\nTUVOLD: Sharnax used to be a major mining post, until the workers aggravated the Igris. They’ve killed everyone who’s landed here since.\nDOCTOR: You created a super soldier and thought it wouldn’t rebel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 78\nTUVOLD: Well, it’s not all of them. It’s only isolated communities.\nDOCTOR: They’re still in use?\nTUVOLD: We’ve learnt not to anger them. The one on the Alendra was a special case. Altus was... experimenting on it to find its weakness.\nDOCTOR: By which you mean torturing?\nTUVOLD: I’m not trying to justify it.\nDOCTOR: So why are you on this mission?\nTUVOLD: Me?\nDOCTOR: If you weren’t supposed to land. You were the only Gadarel on board. Ambassador, nothing less.\nTUVOLD: Ambassador, yes, that’s a joke. It’s a new position. I’m the first. (BEAT) Sharnax’s deep in Sorsha territory, they wouldn’t allow us to lead our own rescue party. Whole thing could have been a subterfuge to get a warship in. Aldron Sorsha—\nDOCTOR: The King?\nTUVOLD: Their King, yes, he insisted on having his people lead the mission. We insisted on having a representative on board. Me. Not exactly my thing. I’ve always rather shied away from noble causes.\nDOCTOR: You could have refused.\nTUVOLD: Hardly. I’m Aliona’s uncle.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 79\nTUVOLD: Valdarn Gadarel was my brother. His widow didn’t feel she could trust anyone else. Refusal would have been seen as an act of treason.\nDOCTOR: Not traditionally a well-regarded crime. So neither of us are here by choice. And neither of us are entirely trusted, it would appear.\nTUVOLD: Not now Shira’s dead. She trusted me, she was a good woman. All the good people die. I’m so tired of war.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 80\nKYLO: Stop looking at me like that, Altus.\nALTUS: I saw what happened, your Highness.\nKYLO: What happened? What do you mean, what happened?\nALTUS: On the lander. I saw.\nKYLO: I don’t know what you’re talking about.\nALTUS: I saw. You’ve not been taking your medication, have you?\nKYLO: My... medication...?\nALTUS: You said you have, but you haven't.\nKYLO: (BEAT) You can’t know that for a fact...\nALTUS: (RAISING HIS VOICE) I saw what happened, your highness, I saw! (BEAT. REALISES HE’S BEEN TOO LOUD) I saw it burn.\nKYLO: With Aliona missing I’ve been under a lot of stress.\nALTUS: That’s precisely when you need to take it!\nKYLO: I know! I know, and I’m sorry.\nALTUS: You can’t run the risk, you know what happened to your great- grandfather.\nKYLO: Emperor Luko?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 81\nALTUS: Yes, you don’t want that to happen to you, do you?\nKYLO: No. No, I don’t want that.\nALTUS: At least we’ve nipped it in the bud. No harm done. You can start again now. (SILENCE) You can start again now? (BEAT) Can’t you?\nKYLO: (BEAT) I may have left my medication on the ship.\nALTUS: The Alendra?\nKYLO: I suspect it might not exist any more.\nALTUS: You — In Empire’s name!\nKYLO: I didn’t do it deliberately!\nALTUS: But —\nCORWYN: Your highness, we’ve located the wedding galley, we’1ll be there in five minutes, I thought you’d want to be informed.\nKYLO: Ah — excellent. Thank you, Corwyn. Thank you. I — If you’ll excuse me. (KYLO LEAVES)\nCORWYN: Was this a bad time? I thought he’d be happier.\nALTUS: (BEAT) No, no, it’s nothing... important...\nCORWYN: Good. Only... I’d hate it if the heir to the throne —\nALTUS: (AWKWARD, CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Er, look, um.. Commander. Can I ask you a question.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 82\nCORWYN: (BEAT) Certainly, go ahead.\nALTUS: The Doctor’s talk about... sabotage...\nCORWYN: I thought we’d agreed not to discuss that...\nALTUS: Riga. We were never sure about Riga. She was a risk.\nCORWYN: She’s the finest pilot in the fleet.\nALTUS: And was a member of anti-Gadarel groups at the academy.\nCORWYN: We all did things we weren’t proud of at the academy.\nALTUS: You saw how she reacted to the Doctor. And Tuvold.\nCORWYN: Everyone’s a risk, Altus. You’re a risk. I’m a risk. My wife was caught in a Gadarel bombing raid, remember? Barely came out alive, did you forget that?\nALTUS: No, I —\nCORWYN: I still want peace. I don’t want anyone else to suffer like her, like me. You can’t decide these things by numbers, Altus. Maybe Riga’s changed, changed her mind. People do that.\nALTUS: What if she hasn’t?\nCORWYN: We’re not discussing this further. Prepare yourself. We’re nearly there. (OUT) Everyone. We reach the target in four minutes. Four minutes. Be ready. (TO ALTUS) Remember what I said, Altus.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 83\nTUVOLD: You think you can get us off this planet?\nDOCTOR: If I can find my ship I’m certain of it. Need to do a scan for temporal energies, there shouldn’t be any other sources down here...\nKYLO: (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Medication. Always with the medication... (BUMPS INTO THE DOCTOR) Oops, sorry.\nDOCTOR: No, no, that’s quite alright. Kylo, isn’t it? Didn’t really speak properly back on the ship. I’m the Doctor.\nKYLO: Oh, yes, you said. Hello.\nDOCTOR: Is something the matter?\nKYLO: What? Oh, no. No, I’m just... distracted. It’s difficult to concentrate. You know, while Aliona’s out there. Lost.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nKYLO: Until I have her safe... I can’t relax.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) You really are in love with her, aren’t you?\nKYLO: Of course. D’you think I’d come all this way if I wasn’t?\nDOCTOR: Oh, not at all, it’s just these things are usually a marriage of convenience, no genuine affection on either side.\nKYLO: She’s wonderful. The most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. Never met anyone like her in my life.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 84\nTUVOLD: She is a wonder to behold.\nKYLO: No idea what she sees in me. Runt of the litter. The fall-back heir.\nDOCTOR: Maybe she looks beyond those things.\nKYLO: You know... I’d forgotten... if it wasn’t for the crash... today would have been our wedding day. I’d have been holding her in my arms right now.\nDOCTOR: I hope you get her back.\nKYLO: I'd better.\nRIGA: (CALLING OUT FROM THE FRONT) Coming up on it now!\nRIGA: (THE SKIMMER SHUDDERS TO A HALT. IGRIS PACE AROUND THE\nBACKGROUND: )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR: That’s the Galley?\nTUVOLD: Doesn’t look in the best shape, does it?\nCORWYN: We can’t make any assumptions.\nALTUS: We can’t scan for lifeforms from outside. The Igris are in the way, they’1ll interfere with the reading.\nRIGA: All life rafts still attached. No-one got out that way.\nDOCTOR: There can’t be any survivors, surely?\nKYLO: She’s alive in there. She has to be.\nCORWYN: Everybody suit up, we’re going on board.\nTUVOLD: What? Everyone?\nCORWYN: Got a problem with that?\nKYLO: No. No, I have to find her. I have to be there.\nTUVOLD: We’re not all of us trained for military activity, Commander.\nCORWYN: I don’t want to spend any more time on this benighted rock than I have to. We need to search that thing, thoroughly. The more of us go in, the quicker we get out. Got that? We’re all there.\nDOCTOR: Does it have any intact airlocks?\nRIGA: (CHECKS A READOUT) Just the one I can see.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR: Then it shouldn’t be a problem. We can get across without disturbing the Igris, and I can draw on some of its residual energy to extend our forcefield out around both ships.

Such fine clothing and jewellery and... is that a gun?\nTUVOLD: It’s not part of the traditional marriage vestments.\nDOCTOR: I’d hope not.

Your ship. What happened?\nALIONA: Page 101\nALIONA: We were infiltrated by anti-Gadarel fanatics. Saboteurs.\nKYLO: Us too! How did you — ?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 102\nALIONA: Survive? My crew. They sacrificed themselves. Reversed the shields to create a protective bubble within the ship. It was only big enough for me.\nKYLO: (BEAT) Then we won’t forget them. They shall be the first honoured under our new — (HE STOPS HIMSELF) Altus!\nKYLO: Altus. I killed Altus.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nALIONA: You — ?\nKYLO: (BEAT) I burnt him. Burnt him alive.\nALIONA: Burnt him?\nKYLO: It was an accident! I didn’t mean to!\nDOCTOR: We'll deal with it later. Presently I’m rather more concerned with the people who are still alive. The Igris won’t be gone forever.\nCORWYN: But the forcewal1ll...\nDOCTOR: Is a temporary solution at best. Keep it extended too long and we won’t be able to sustain it all.\nTUVOLD: What about your weapon, Aliona? That’s what disposed of the Igris just now?\nALIONA: It uses vast amounts of power, it takes time to recharge.\nDOCTOR: Time, I think it is safe to assume, we don’t have. We need to get back to the Skimmer and out of here fast.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 103\nALIONA: There’s an abandoned mining base close by, that’s where I’ve been hiding. It’s got its own forcewall, and a shuttle. Sorsha technology, I couldn’t figure out the controls, but you will. We can use that to get off world.\nCORWYN: Excellent, then that’s where we’re going. Back to the skimmer! MOVE!\nDOCTOR: But we don’t need to go to there, there’s my capsule —\nCORWYN: Now!\nKYLO: Come, my sweet...\nTUVOLD: It never stops, does it?\nDOCTOR: Very rarely.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 104\nCORWYN: Come on people, move it, move it! We’ve not got all day!\nDOCTOR: Your highness, that weapon of yours, the one you used on the Igris, can I take a look?\nALIONA: Certainly.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. A gene based firing system.\nKYLO: You recognize the technology?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m just very observant.\nALIONA: Our scientists developed it a few months back. It locks onto broad strands of DNA and destroys anything bearing that genetic code.\nDOCTOR: Very clever. A pulse weapon. You carpet an entire area and only affect those you’ve chosen to affect, sparing everyone else. That’s how you killed the Igris.\nALIONA: I saw your ship crash. I knew where you’d be heading, I thought it might be necessary to mount a rescue.\nDOCTOR: And believe me, I’m very glad you did. Though I’m not exactly pleased about the means you used to do it...\nALIONA: I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: It’s a shame it required such mass slaughter. I’m sure this weapon could easily be adjusted to stun rather than kill.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 105\nALIONA: I don’t understand.\nKYLO: The Doctor’s something of a pacifist, Aliona. He doesn’t approve of bloodshed.\nALIONA: Then he hasn’t lived his whole life in wartime, has he? Some things are evil, Doctor, they deserve to die.\nDOCTOR: We’ll have to agree to disagree.\nCORWYN: Enough talk back there!\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, we’re going as quick as we can!\nCORWYN: Get on with it!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 106\nCORWYN: Right, everyone on board? Seal the airlock, I’m heading for the control deck.\nTUVOLD: (ENTERING) Yes, yes...\nDOCTOR: And door... sealed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 107\nRIGA: We have disengaged. Doctor, can you retract the forcewall?\nDOCTOR: (SITTING AND OPERATING CONTROLS) Retracting the forcewall to just the skimmer, yes, done. Don’t think it can last long. Not more than thirty minutes...\nCORWYN: That’s plenty of time. Pilot. Enter destination, we’re heading for the mining base.\nRIGA: (OPERATING CONTROLS) Sir.\nDOCTOR: Commander, I’ve a far more convenient method of escape than that ship, I mentioned it earlier. From what Aliona said the shuttle isn’t ready to launch. There’1ll be all manner of procedures to get through, now if we head for my TARDIS we can be out of here in moments...\nRIGA: Destination entered.\nCORWYN: Good. No, Doctor, we're heading for the mining base.\nDOCTOR: But it’s a needless risk...\nCORWYN: It’s got a fully powered forcewall of its own, we’ll be safe.\nDOCTOR: Not if it breaks down, there’s still the question of who sabotaged the Alendra, they might still be with us.\nCORWYN: That’s the point. I don’t know who I can trust. Least of all you.\nDOCTOR: Me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 108\nCORWYN: You've been invaluable, yes, but I don’t know who you are, what you want. I don’t even know if this ship of yours exists.\nDOCTOR: I’ve been trying to save everyone!\nCORWYN: And people keep dying. You said we’d be safe on the galley. So where did those creatures come from?\nDOCTOR: I explained that.\nCORWYN: One possible explanation, yes.\nDOCTOR: Corwyn, if I’m trying to kill you, I’ve a funny way of going about it!\nCORWYN: Or you’re playing a very clever game. My cargo’s too precious to risk. I’ve got to place my trust in certainties, if there’s a chance you’re leading us into a trap I have to take the safer option. I’m sorry. Pilot, proceed as ordered.\nRIGA: Sir.\nDOCTOR: Then on your head be it!\nCORWYN: He'll get over it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP) Honestly, of all the idiotic, hair brained — !\nTUVOLD: Doctor —\nDOCTOR: We’re not heading for my ship, we’re heading for the mining compound. In all my lives I’ve never seen any individual less fit for command than... well, actually, I’ve seen several individuals less fit for command than Mister Corwyn, but that’s not the point, the point is —\nTUVOLD: Doctor! You’ll wake the patient.\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, yes, Tyron, of course. Sorry. (BEAT) How is he?\nTUVOLD: Hard to say. I’m an Ambassador, not a medic. I’m well outside my comfort zone. Trying to enjoy the novelty. He’s lost a lot of blood. Riga used a surgeo-graft from the medikit to patch him up, but there’s only so much we can do, the sooner we get him back to civilization the better.\nDOCTOR: If we get back. We could get him away from here so much more quickly if Corwyn would just listen. —\nDOCTOR: Ah. Sounds like we’ve arrived.\nDOCTOR: (THE SKIMMER CONNECTS AGAIN. IGRIS GROWLING, CIRCLING THE\nVEHICLE: )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: (DOORS HISS OPEN. THE SURVIVORS ENTER, TYRON LIMPING IN WITH\nTUVOLD: )\nALIONA: Through here.\nTUVOLD: Come along, Tyron...\nDOCTOR: Not exactly homely, is it?\nCORWYN: It hasn’t been used in forty years, what did you expect?\nKYLO: This is where you were living?\nALIONA: I didn’t have much choice.\nCORWYN: Riga, do you think you can use those controls?\nRIGA: I can try. (SHE MOVES TO THE CONTROLS, STARTS WORKING THEM) Bit old. Rusty. But simple enough. Some rewiring and I might be able to bypass the systems.\nCORWYN: Then get on with it. Try to unlock the shuttle launching protocols.\nRIGA: Sir.\nCORWYN: (TO ALIONA) Are there more rooms?\nALIONA: This corridor.\nDOCTOR: It would have been so much easier if we’d just gone for the\nDOCTOR: TARDIS.\nTUVOLD: I know, Doctor. I know. (ALL BAR RIGA EXIT)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 111\nALIONA: That corridor there leads to the launch tunnel, two floors below. That way’s the bedrooms, kitchen. This is the living quarters.\nTUVOLD: Comfy. Tyron, you should sit.\nTYRON: Alright.\nDOCTOR: How are you feeling?\nTYRON: Fine. (HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS )\nDOCTOR: You don’t sound fine. You need proper medical attention, that\nDOCTOR: graft won’t last long.\nTYRON: Long enough.\nCORWYN: I’1l check the shuttle. Everyone wait here.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see what’s happening outside.\nDOCTOR: (HE PRESSES A BUTTON. A WINDOW COVER SLIDES OPEN. OUTSIDE HUNDREDS OF IGRIS MOVING ABOUT. PACING. GROWLING.\nBACK: INSIDE THE IGRIS NOISE CONTINUES, MUTED)\nTUVOLD: They’re still massing.\nDOCTOR: They know we’re here. And they want us gone.\nTUVOLD: Really? I want us gone too. You think it’d be a simple compromise.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: Er... Kylo...\nKYLO: Yes?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s time we talked about what happened on the Galley, don’t you?\nTUVOLD: (WARNING) Doctor...\nKYLO: No, no, it’s quite alright, Tuvold, I can fight my own battles.\nDOCTOR: What happened?\nKYLO: Well... you saw, didn’t you? I set him on fire. I got angry and I set him on fire.\nALIONA: Ky lo...\nKYLO: I didn’t mean to. I didn’t. I might not have liked him but I never wanted to kill him.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad to hear it.\nKYLO: I swear, Doctor, I will make reparation for that man’s life. I will. But it was an accident, you have to know that, I didn’t want him to die.\nDOCTOR: I know. You’re a pyro-kinetic aren’t you? You can make things burn with your mind?\nKYLO: (BEAT) It just happens. When I’m angry, when I lose control...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 113\nKYLO: . things burst into flame.\nALIONA: You know about this?\nDOCTOR: I know of it. A very specific form of telekinesis.\nTUVOLD: Of what?\nDOCTOR: The ability to psychically manoeuvre objects without touching them. Our young Prince can’t quite do that but he can manipulate matter at a fairly fundamental level. When he gets excited, agitated... so do the molecules of whatever he happens to focus on. They move rapidly, rub up against each other. The friction causes them to burst into flame.\nKYLO: That’s what it is?\nDOCTOR: That’s what it is.\nKYLO: I’ve always known I was different. I was told. From an early age.. my brain doesn’t work like other people’s.\nALIONA: What are you talking about?\nKYLO: Why do you think our Great-Grandfather went mad, split the family? He was like this too. Drove him insane.\nALIONA: I don’t understand.\nKYLO: There’s a recurrent genetic abnormality in the Drashani royal house. In our minds. It’s random, it doesn’t affect everyone, just some of us. And it affects me. I have a mutated brain.\nALIONA: No.\nKYLO: We tried to keep it secret. I took medication to suppress it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 114\nALIONA: Oh, my love...\nKYLO: But it never goes away. It never truly goes. I’m sorry.\nALIONA: For what?\nKYLO: That I didn’t tell you. I should have told you. (BEAT) Can you still love me? Can you, Aliona?\nALIONA: Oh my beautiful man, how can you even ask?\nTUVOLD: Gladdens the heart, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: (UNCONVINCED) Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 115\nRIGA: Commander, Riga. I’m nearly done. The system’s online, I’ve initiated fuelling procedure, just need to over-ride the key- codes, upload the flight pattern and we can launch. (BEAT) Commander? Commander, are you there? (BEAT) Hmm.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 116\nKYLO: Tyron, stop, stop, sit down, the Doctor said you should be careful.\nTYRON: (BREATHING HEAVILY) I don’t want to be careful. I’m a soldier, I’ve sat long enough. Give me my bow.\nKYLO: If you insist.\nTUVOLD: Why are the military always so stubborn?\nDOCTOR: It does seem to go with the territory, doesn’t it? (BEAT) Well, at least we know what we’re dealing with now.\nTUVOLD: We do?\nDOCTOR: As long as we keep the young Prince calm we shouldn’t have to worry about another outburst like on the Galley.\nTUVOLD: Hopefully Aliona will prove a calming influence.\nDOCTOR: Hopefully. (BEAT) You know, the Commander’s been gone an awfully long time. I wonder if he’s [alright?]\nDOCTOR: (THE DOOR TO THE BEDROOMS IS SMASHED APART AND AN IGRIS BURSTS\nTHROUGH: )\nKYLO: Igris!\nTUVOLD: How did they — ?\nTYRON: Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 117\nKYLO: There’s dozens of them!\nALIONA: No!\nTYRON: Run!\nTYRON: (HE LOOSES OFF ARROWS, AS THE OTHERS RETREAT. THE IGRIS IS\nFOLLOWED: BY MORE, FLOWING INTO THE ROOM)\nKYLO: Aliona, quickly!\nALIONA: But the gun —\nTUVOLD: I’ve got it!\nTYRON: I said run!\nDOCTOR: Everyone! Head for the shuttle! Quickly!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 118\nKYLO: How did they get in? I thought the forcewall was up!\nDOCTOR: Clearly not any more!\nTUVOLD: Our saboteur’s back.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think he was ever gone. Your highnesses! Get to the shuttle!\nKYLO: Right, yes, of course. Aliona.\nALIONA: Coming.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OVER HIS SHOULDER) And keep him calm! (TO TYRON) You alright, Tyron?\nTYRON: I’1l live.\nTUVOLD: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: The forcewall may be down, but I can replicate its effects here at least with a variable pulse on the doorway. Won’t last long but it’ll keep them at bay for a couple of minutes.\nDOCTOR: (A SHATTERING CRASH FROM THE OTHER SIDE. HE WORKS THE BUTTONS AGAIN. A BURST OF ENERGY )\nDOCTOR: There. They won’t find that so easy to get through. We can head for — ah.\nTUVOLD: What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: Riga.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 119\nTYRON: She’s still in the control room.\nDOCTOR: And if she hasn’t unlocked the controls we won’t be able to launch the shuttle. We’ll be trapped.\nDOCTOR: There must be some internal communications systems. I just need to find the right... Ah!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 120\nRIGA: (ANSWERING) Yes, Commander, I’m nearly done, the key codes are cracked, you’ll be ready to launch in five. That good?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) It’s wonderful, but I’m not the Commander.\nRIGA: Doctor? Where’s Corwyn?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Oh, I think he’s safe. Riga, there’s a problem. The Igris have broken into the base.\nRIGA: What? You let them in?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Not again. I’m trying to save your life.\nRIGA: (BEAT) Okay, point taken. What do you want to do?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) I’ve sent you the data to generate a temporary forcewall on the door, it should hold them back for a few minutes, have you received it?\nRIGA: got it!\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Enter the codes into the locking mechanism.\nRIGA: I’m way ahead of you. (SHE ENTERS THE CODES) Come on, come on... (SAME PULSE AS PREVIOUS SCENE) Done! (SHE RUNS BACK FOR THE DESK)\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Has it worked?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 121\nRIGA: Like a dream. Right, what now?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Ah, that’s just it, I’m afraid. I’ve no idea.\nRIGA: (BEAT) Oh, great rescue plan. Knew there was a reason I didn’t like your damn house.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) I’m not Gadarel, Riga.\nRIGA: Might as well be.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) We’re heading for the launch bay. Do you think you’1l be able to get through the living quarters to us?\nRIGA: If the Igris are in there, no chance, I’m almost out of arrowbolts.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Then you’1ll have to find an alternate route over.\nRIGA: (OPERATING CONTROLS) I’1l check the database.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Good. We’d better be moving. Keep us informed. Best of luck. Out.\nRIGA: (READING) Alternate route to shuttle bay... none. Trapped.\nRIGA: Looks like I’1l just have to work quickly, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 122\nTUVOLD: She’s dead, isn’t she?\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope not.\nTYRON: Right, that’s done. One magazine left.\nTUVOLD: We’re out of arrows?\nTYRON: Almost, I.. oh. (HE SWOONS, NEARLY COLLAPSES. TUVOLD CATCHES HIM)\nDOCTOR: There, that should hold them back for — Is he alright?\nTYRON: Think that run might have been a bit too much.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Then we’1ll have to help him to the shuttle. Hope the Igris don’t beat us there. Come on. I’11l give you a hand.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 123\nALIONA: The shuttle, great!\nKYLO: Aliona, wait! I need to send the lift back for the others.\nALIONA: Why? We’re the one’s we need to save.\nKYLO: They helped me! (HE OPERATES CONTROLS) I can’t —\nCORWYN: (BEHIND) Your highness —\nALIONA: (SUDDEN CRY) Behind you!\nALIONA: (KYLO TURNS. CORWYN SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS BOW ACROSS KYLO’S FACE. WITH A CRY, KYLO DROPS TO THE FLOOR, UNCONSCIOUS )\nALIONA: You — you —\nCORWYN: Don’t worry, he’s not dead. The butt of a bow’s not heavy enough to kill. Head of my house, you see, can’t just murder him. Have to leave him to the Igris. Keep the blood off my hands.\nALIONA: What?\nCORWYN: This would have been so much simpler if we’d all just died on the ship. That was the plan. Why couldn’t we all have just died on the ship?\nCORWYN: I’m sorry, your highness. This is how it has to be.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: There. That must be the lift down to the shuttle bay. Rest here. I’11 call it.\nTUVOLD: Didn’t think you’d be so heavy.\nTYRON: Sorry. Army rations.\nTYRON: (THEY REST HIM. THE DOCTOR OPERATES CONTROLS ON THE LIFT DOORS.\nSOMEWHERE: BEHIND A DOOR SHATTERS. GROWLS OF APPROACHING IGRIS)\nTUVOLD: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Igris must be through, didn’t think it’d take them long.\nTYRON: They’re behind us?\nDOCTOR: And not carrying a dead weight, no offence. Won’t take more than a minute or two to catch up...\nDOCTOR: And I’d rather you didn’t use that on them, Tuvold, if it’s all the same to you.\nTUVOLD: Aliona’s gun? Don’t worry. Doesn’t look like it’s fully charged yet.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You know, that’s odd. Funny thing to have with you ona wedding galley, isn’t it, a gun? Hardly the most romantic object in the world...\nTYRON: Where’s that lift?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Being a bit slow. It’s only got two floors to come, can’t take long. Unless Corwyn’s sabotaged it too.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 125\nTUVOLD: (BAFFLED) Corwyn?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) Corwyn’s the saboteur.\nTYRON: The Commander?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it obvious? Someone let the Igris in here, only Corwyn and Riga had the opportunity. If Riga wanted us dead she could have crashed the lander when we arrived. That’s why Corwyn was so difficult about heading for the TARDIS. The last thing he wanted was a swift departure. He’s been nothing but awkwardness Since we found out Aliona was alive. Are you really telling me you didn’t know?\nTUVOLD: But why? I thought he wanted peace?\nDOCTOR: I suspect you’d have to ask him.\nDOCTOR: You know, I do hope this lift gets here on time...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: (IN THE BACKGROUND THE LIFT DOORS CLOSE. IT RISES. ALIONA IS\nBACKING: AWAY AS CORWYN ADVANCES )\nALIONA: Please. Please no.\nCORWYN: I’m sorry.\nALIONA: Why are you doing this?\nCORWYN: Morletz Five, does that mean anything to you?\nALIONA: Should it?\nCORWYN: Just more collateral damage to you, isn’t it? You’re never in the firing line, are you, just sit in your palaces watching other people’s corpses pile up fighting your war. Well you’re in the firing line now.\nALIONA: If this is some kind of revenge...\nCORWYN: My wife was on Morletz Five when your people bombed it. Don’t know how they got her out. She hasn’t woken up since. If she does she’1l be crippled for life even with the best medical care. And I can’t afford the best medical care.\nALIONA: Listen to me —\nCORWYN: Do you know what a Commander’s salary is, highness? A pittance. Barely enough. So when they offered me the deal...\nALIONA: Who?\nCORWYN: I don’t know their names. Fanatics. Die hard anti-Gadarel fanatics. Millions of credits for a suicide mission. Stop the marriage, she gets a chance to live. I couldn’t say no.\nALIONA: But you’d be dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 127\nCORWYN: Rather she lives than me. (BEAT) Sorry. For what it’s worth... I do want peace. But not as much as I want my wife to stop suffering. I’m so sorry about this.\nALIONA: Oh, don’t be. Because if I’ve got any say in the matter, your wife is going to die in unbearable pain and agony.\nCORWYN: What?\nCORWYN: Aargh...\nALIONA: She won’t last long. But a little bit longer than you.\nCORWYN: You — you...\nALIONA: Shot you, yes. Concealed weapons are a bit of a cheat, aren’t they... just needed you to drop your guard for a second, thanks for that...\nCORWYN: a\nALIONA: I want peace too. But I want it through victory, not appeasement. My father was killed by your troops. Your stinking, traitorous troops, you think I want that to go for nothing? Get forgotten? I want the peace that comes when every last Sorsha is dead beneath my feet.\nCORWYN: I...\nALIONA: Starting with you.\nCORWYN: No, I —\nALIONA: Empire be praised. Now. Kylo, ‘my love’. (SHE STRUGGLES TO PICK UP KYLO) Let’s get on board... (SHE DRAGS HIM OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 128\nTUVOLD: Doctor, they’re nearly here.\nTYRON: I ain’t got enough arrows for the lot, you’d better have a plan.\nDOCTOR: Not really.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s given me a lift. Quick, inside.\nTYRON: They’re coming!\nTUVOLD: Doctor, we need to hurry!\nDOCTOR: I know, I know. Going down!\nDOCTOR: (HE OPERATES THE LIFT. THE DOORS CLOSE, SHUTTING OUT THE\nNEARING: IGRIS. THEY DROP AWAY)\nNEARING: Well, looks like we got away with that.\nNEARING: (ABOVE, THERE’S A TREMENDOUS WRENCHING SOUND AS THE DOOR IS\nRIPPED: APART. AN IGRIS DROPS DOWN, LANDS ON THE ROOF WITH A THUD)\nRIPPED: Maybe not.\nTUVOLD: It’s on the roof!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I can adjust Aliona’s gun to stun...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 129\nTUVOLD: Doctor, it’s not got the power, we've no.. time...\nDOCTOR: Tyron, what are you — ?\nTYRON: Going up!\nDOCTOR: There’s not enough space up there!\nTYRON: I know.\nDOCTOR: Keep back! Stay away from its claws!\nDOCTOR: (THE LIFT REACHES THE TOP OF THE SHAFT. WITH A SICKENING CRUNCH THE IGRIS IS CRUSHED. IT SAGS AND DIES)\nTUVOLD: That was too close.\nDOCTOR: You killed it!\nTYRON: I didn’t have much choice!\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) I know. I don’t have to like it though. Well, hopefully that’1ll scare them off. We need to get to the Shuttle Bay. Looks like it’s our only way out of here...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 130\nRIGA: Oh, not yet, just need a few more seconds... The flight plan’s nearly uploaded... (BEAT) There!\nRIGA: Doctor, Corwyn, don’t know if you can hear me, but I’m done, the shuttle’s free to go and —\nRIGA: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE LIFT DOORS PING OPEN. THE FIREFIGHT FROM THE CONTROL ROOM CONTINUES, DISTORTED OVER SPEAKERS AS TUVOLD AND THE DOCTOR\nCARRY: OUT TYRON)\nDOCTOR: Here we are...\nTYRON: Doctor, listen!\nRIGA: (DISTORT, LOOSING OFF ARROWS) Come on then! Do your worst! Empire be Praised! House Sorsha for - !\nRIGA: (OVER THE SPEAKERS, SHE SCREAMS AND IS TORN APART. THE\nCOMMUNICATOR: CUTS OUT)\nTUVOLD: She’s dead.\nDOCTOR: She’s not the only one, look!\nTUVOLD: Corwyn!\nTYRON: He’s been shot!\nDOCTOR: Yes.

We’re on the shuttle, how do you feel?\nKYLO: Me, I — I’m... I’ve got an awful headache.\nALIONA: Yes, that’1ll be Corwyn. He knocked you out.\nKYLO: What?\nALIONA: Smashed you in the face with the butt of his bow. You were out cold.\nKYLO: Corwyn? Corwyn hit me? Commander Corwyn?\nALIONA: He was your saboteur. He brought down your ship.\nKYLO: But — (HE TRIES TO MOVE, REACTS WITH PAIN) I can’t stand up...\nALIONA: No, I’ve tied you to the chair. Yes, good old dependable Corwyn. He’d been bribed by Anti-Gadarel fanatics, he was quite articulate about it. But he can’t harm you now. I killed him.\nKYLO: What? You — ?\nKYLO: (ALIONA PRESSES A SWITCH ON A DEVICE. A LOW BUZZING SOUND. KYLO GASPS IN PAIN)\nALIONA: Of course, he’s not the one you need to worry about.\nKYLO: (IN PAIN) What are you — ?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 133\nALIONA: It’s a psychic suppressor. We know about your little problem you see, my spies were very thorough. Wouldn’t want you...\nALIONA: flaring up on me.\nKYLO: What are you doing?\nALIONA: Oh my sweet Prince. Still haven’t figured it out yet, have you?\nKYLO: I don’t —\nALIONA: The marriage was a sham. A way to infiltrate your homeworld. Nothing more.\nKYLO: (BEAT) No.\nALIONA: You fell for the pretty girl. Oldest trick in the book.\nKYLO: What are you talking about?\nALIONA: I don’t love you. Never did.\nKYLO: But... but you said...!\nALIONA: It was a lie. It was all a lie. Now shut up while I launch this thing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Tyron, do you think you can get to the shuttle? That lift shaft won’t stop the Igris long and there’s other exit...\nTYRON: Reckon I can —\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nTUVOLD: Is that — ?\nDOCTOR: The shuttle, it’s taking off!\nDOCTOR: (THE ROAR OF ENGINES IS LOUDER AS THE DOCTOR AND TUVOLD APPROACH, TYRON HOBBLING BEHIND)\nTUVOLD: But who’s on board?\nDOCTOR: Keep back, keep back, the heat’1ll be too much...\nTYRON: They’re leaving without us!\nDOCTOR: I know, now keep back!\nDOCTOR: (THEY DRAG TYRON BACK AS WITH A HUGE ROAR THE SHUTTLE LAUNCHES OFF AND AWAY.

The things you told me...\nALIONA: None of them true. It sickened me. All of it. Looking at that face of yours, having to kiss it, kiss it and smile.\nKYLO: No.\nALIONA: But you do what you have to do. For the good of your family, the good of your people. If it helps you don’t love me either.\nKYLO: What? How can you say that!\nALIONA: Not the way you think you do.

I’d dump your body out that airlock without a second’s thought.\nKYLO: Aliona, this isn’t you. I know you.\nALIONA: You really, really don’t. Now.

Nothing else here’s going to be radiating the same sort of power as my TARDIS.

Given the way the last few hours have gone, you’ll forgive me if I find that sentence a little ominous.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Let me put it this way. You remember how the forcewall on this skimmer keeping the Igris away was running out of power?\nTUVOLD: Yes.\nTYRON: Yeah. (COUGHS)\nDOCTOR: Well, it would appear we have to find the TARDIS a little more quickly than I’d anticipated, that’s all.\nTUVOLD: Excellent. I’1ll try to radio the rocket, get them to come back for us, they must have thought we wouldn’t get out...\nDOCTOR: I’ve a sneaking suspicion that wasn’t it.\nTUVOLD: Skimmer calling shuttle, come in please. Skimmer calling shuttle, come in...\nTYRON: Blood. Oh, Empire — there’s blood...\nDOCTOR: Maybe you’d better lie down, Tyron.\nTYRON: I’m a soldier, Doctor, I don’t — (COUGHS AGAIN)\nTUVOLD: Doctor, I’ve reached the shuttle. (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Skimmer calling shuttle.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 143\nTUVOLD: (DISTORT) Repeat, skimmer calling shuttle, this is Ambassador Tuvold, can anyone hear me?\nKYLO: Is that — is that your Uncle?\nTUVOLD: Can you hear us, is there anyone there?\nALIONA: Uncle Tuvold!\nTUVOLD: Aliona!\nALIONA: (DISTORT) You got out alive! How’d you manage that, did the Doctor overcome his silly pacifist tendencies?\nDOCTOR: They’re not silly. I was able to make your weapon’s effects temporary rather than permanent.\nALIONA: (DISTORT) Good for you, you are clever. Bit of a waste though, they’re just dumb animals. They’ve got to make way for the Superior race, it’s the natural order.\nDOCTOR: You’1l never understand.\nALIONA: Probably not. Speaking of dumb animals, Kylo’s here. You want a word?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED) Put him on.\nALIONA: Here we go.\nKYLO: Doctor? Doctor, she says she’s going to kill my family...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought as much.\nTUVOLD: What?\nDOCTOR: It was all too convenient to be real, you see. The marriage that stops the war, based on genuine love. And your mask slipped a bit back on the galley. Some things ‘deserve to die’, wasn’t it? Hardly the sentiment of a born peacemaker.\nALIONA: (DISTORT) Nobody’s perfect.\nDOCTOR: Bringing a gun was always going to be suspicious but abandoning us was the last straw. The whole wedding was a sham wasn’t it? A con?\nALIONA: Yes. Fake. I’d never marry him.\nKYLO: No...\nALIONA: Shut up!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) It was staged. Including the crash?\nALIONA: No, that was the one thing that was real. Fanatics wanting to stop the wedding, wanting to stop peace. If they’d just left me alone, I’d have won the war for them.\nTUVOLD: This isn’t her. It can’t be. This is not the niece I knew.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure you ever knew her at all. (INTO RADIO) What was the plan? It was to do with that gun of yours, wasn’t it?\nALIONA: I can tell you’re not a Sorsha. You’re smart. You’d make a fine consort for an Empress.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) I’m flattered, but I suspect it wouldn’t work out.\nALIONA: Pity. Yes, we have a larger scale version of the pulse gun, primed and ready. The idea was to infiltrate the Royal Palace and obtain a sample of Sorsha DNA. Wipe out all the pretenders in one stroke. Kill the lot of them.\nKYLO: It’s not true!\nALIONA: I said be quiet!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR: You can give it up now, Aliona. It won’t work.\nALIONA: (DISTORT) Really? Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m going to stop you.\nALIONA: (DISTORT) From down there? I’m sure your corpse’1ll find that very easy to do.\nDOCTOR: I don’t make idle promises, Aliona. We’ll be seeing you soon, don’t worry. Skimmer out.\nTYRON: (COUGHS. HE’S VERY WEAK) That’s who we were rescuing?\nTUVOLD: Doctor, that girl does not speak for me.\nDOCTOR: I know that, Tuvold.\nTUVOLD: She was such a sweet child. Where did this come from?\nDOCTOR: Hatred’s irrational, it’s a law unto itself.\nTUVOLD: Must have fallen into a bad group when she was away from the family, at her studies. Had her mind twisted...\nDOCTOR: No, I imagine it was always like that, it usually is. She just hid it very well. (THE CONSOLE BEEPS) Ah, there we are! A huge wave of Artron energy! We’ve found the TARDIS. Quick as we can then...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR: You alright, Tyron?\nTYRON: (COUGHS AGAIN) No.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, soon have you out of here. The TARDIS can go anywhere, we can use it to get to that shuttle.\nTYRON: But didn’t you say it was... um...\nTUVOLD: ‘Wilful’, I think was the word.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s one thing after another, isn’t it? We’ll cross that\nDOCTOR: bridge when we come to it.\nTUVOLD: Doctor... the Igris are massing again.\nDOCTOR: I know Tuvold. I know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 148\nALIONA: I wonder what he meant, see us soon?\nKYLO: How would I know?\nALIONA: He mentioned a capsule. Perhaps he’s got another way offworld...\nKYLO: Please...\nALIONA: (BEAT) Ah, he’s too late anyway. What can he do? We’ve nearly reached the edge of the atmosphere. It’s time.\nKYLO: What are you doing?\nALIONA: Here we are. A medikit. If I remember rightly, DNA readers come as standard...\nKYLO: I don’t understand.\nALIONA: Useful for skin grafts and the like. Ah, this is it. (SHE PULLS OUT A BOX) Ooh, and a laser scalpel. Nice. (SHE RETRIEVES THE SCALPEL, DISCARDS THE CASE)\nKYLO: What are you going to do with that?\nALIONA: Identify the Sorsha DNA code. It was the only way of getting close enough you see. The marriage. Close enough to get the biological data. Hmm, shame it’s not a scanner, really. There was one built into the gun, you could just point it at your target and get a reading, but these... You know how these work?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 149\nKYLO: No.\nALIONA: You need a sample. Pop it in the box here then it does the\nALIONA: rest. Bit clumsy in comparison.\nKYLO: (PANICKY) A... sample?\nALIONA: Oh, don’t worry. It needn’t be much. No more than a lock of your hair...\nALIONA: But your hand will do just as well.\nALIONA: (THE SKIMMER COMES TO A HALT. MASSES OF IGRIS PROWLING AROUND THE AREA)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: And if you take a glance out of the starboard window, coming up you should see...\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS!\nTUVOLD: That’s your ship?\nTYRON: (WEAK) The blue box?\nDOCTOR: Yes, the blue box! What were you expecting?\nTUVOLD: I don’t know, something a little more... capsuley.\nDOCTOR: Some people are never satisfied. That, gentlemen, is our way offworld. Might not look much, but it’s survived a fall from the upper atmosphere with barely a scratch... even if it has landed at a rather rakish angle.\nTYRON: How do we get in?\nDOCTOR: Through the door on the upper side, how else?\nTUVOLD: But there’s no airlock. We won’t be able to connect the skimmer.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Oh.\nTYRON: And there’s thousands of those creatures out there.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Oh.\nTUVOLD: We’ve no mean of reaching those doors before they get us.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: (LONG PAUSE) Oh.\nTYRON: That’s all you can say, ‘oh’?\nDOCTOR: Nothing else is coming to mind.\nTUVOLD: Can you loop out the forcewall again, like at the Galley?\nDOCTOR: It’s already fatally unstable. With the additional stress it’d collapse instantly. The moment it goes, they’1ll tear their way in and destroy us.\nTUVOLD: Not looking good, is it?\nDOCTOR: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 152\nKYLO: My hand, you cut off my hand!\nALIONA: Shouldn’t have touched me with it then, should you?\nALIONA: Oh, does it hurt? Be grateful, it could be worse. The laser scalpel cauterises the wound so there’s no blood, it’s really rather efficient. Right, let’s pop this in here...\nALIONA: And see...\nALIONA: (SHE PRESSES A BUTTON. THE BOX MAKES A SCANNING SOUND. THE\nBEEPS: )\nBEEPS: Excellent, the precise DNA breakdown of the Royal House of Sorsha. How generous of you. What a divine wedding gift.\nKYLO: You don’t have to do this —\nALIONA: Oh, my love, don’t cry. I’m happy too. Everything’s alright. The pain will be gone soon. It’s over. It’s all over. It’s the end of the war.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 153\nTUVOLD: (BEAT) Let me look at her gun. Maybe we could take them out with...\nTUVOLD: No, still not recharged...\nTYRON: How long’s it need?\nTUVOLD: Five minutes. How long’s the forcewall going to last?\nDOCTOR: Er... (CHECKS READOUT) Two minutes.\nTUVOLD: I see.\nDOCTOR: The conclusion’s rather mathematically inescapable, isn’t it?\nTUVOLD: The forcewall can’t last til it’s ready.. so in two minutes they break in and kill us.\nDOCTOR: Yes, pretty much.\nTYRON: No way out.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t say that. There’s always a way out. Just not always one that’s easy to spot in ninety seconds.\nTUVOLD: We've pulled up very close, we could probably jump.\nTYRON: That’s all you got? (COUGHS AGAIN) Come on, we all know what’s got to happen, don’t we?\nDOCTOR: We do?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 154\nTYRON: It’s me, innit? (COUGHS) This one’s got my name all over it. Shira sacrifices herself for peace. So does Riga. Looks like it’s my turn...\nDOCTOR: Tyron.\nTUVOLD: No.\nTYRON: Should have died on the ship. With the boys. That’s what was supposed to happen...\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to do this.\nTYRON: Look at me! (COUGHS) I’m dead either way, I won’t make it home. Rather go out in a blaze of glory than fade away... Where’s my bow? (HE FINDS IT, PULLS IT ON UNDER)\nDOCTOR: There’1l be something else.\nTYRON: There won’t.\nDOCTOR: Tyron, please —\nTYRON: Either this or I shoot you both now, okay? It’ll be a mercy, don’t want the Igris getting us. Well? Which is it going to be?\nDOCTOR: Tyron —\nTYRON: Stop her, alright? For me? Stop the Princess? That’s all I want.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) I’ll do the very best I can.\nTYRON: Be ready to drop the forcefield when I’m set. (WITH A SUPREME EFFORT, HE LEAPS FOR THE LADDER AND STARTS TO CLIMB)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 155\nTUVOLD: What’s he...?\nDOCTOR: He’s going to draw them off.\nTUVOLD: By jumping from the roof?\nDOCTOR: Well, it keeps them away from the airlock.\nDOCTOR: We should prepare.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: (IGRIS MASSING EVERYWHERE, SLIGHTLY DISTANT BEHIND THE BUZZ OF THE FORCEWALL. TYRON CLAMBERS ONTO THE TOP OF THE SKIMMER. HE\nUNSHOULDERS: HIS BOW. COUGHS. RECOVERS )\nTYRON: (CALLING OUT) Right, I’m ready!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OUT) Thank you, Tyron! (TO TUVOLD) The moment they move, we run, got that? Let’s get this airlock open. (PRESSES\nSOME: CONTROLS. THE AIRLOCK OPENS)\nTUVOLD: You can get us into your ship before they come for us?\nDOCTOR: No idea. But it’1ll be interesting finding out. It’s bigger on the inside, by the way, don’t let that throw you, we don’t have the time. (CALLING OUT) Here we go!\nTYRON: Here I am then, come and get me!\nTYRON: Come on! I’m up here! Come on!\nTYRON: That’s more like it! Alright then, this way!\nTYRON: (WITH AN EFFORT, HE RUNS AWAY ACROSS THE ROOF AND JUMPS OFF, THE IGRIS PURSUING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR: He’s drawn them off! Now!\nTYRON: Agh! Stupid... stupid...\nTYRON: (HE LIMPS OFF. THE IGRIS ARE CATCHING UP TO HIM. HE FIRES OFF A\nFEW: MORE ARROWS )\nFEW: That the best you can do! You dumb animals, think you can —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR: Here we are. (FUMBLING FOR THE KEY) Come on Doctor, open the door.\nTUVOLD: They’ve got Tyron. He’s down. He’s dead.\nDOCTOR: Don’t look back, Tuvold.\nDOCTOR: (THE IGRIS ARE SWARMING BACK FOR THEM AS THE DOCTOR GOES FOR THE DOOR)\nTUVOLD: They’ve seen us! They’re heading back this way.\nDOCTOR: I said don’t look!\nTUVOLD: Still two minutes left to full charge...\nDOCTOR: You brought Aliona’s gun? You could have left it on the\nDOCTOR: skimmer!\nTUVOLD: I had to do something!\nDOCTOR: Done it! Inside!\nTUVOLD: You don’t have to tell me twice.\nDOCTOR: Wait for me!\nDOCTOR: (THE DOCTOR DIVES IN. THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT AS THE IGRIS ARRIVE. IT DEMATERIALISES AS THEY PROWL, ANGRILY)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 159\nDOCTOR WHO: (KYLO WHIMPERING QUIETLY IN THE BACKGROUND. ALIONA DRUMMING\nFINGERS: )\nKYLO: What's... what’s happening...\nALIONA: Just waiting to see if they got the message.\nKYLO: Who?\nALIONA: Oh, we’ve agents everywhere on your planet, my love. Loyal men ready to trigger DNA pulses across the world the moment the code comes through. Wipe House Sorsha off the map.\nKYLO: You can’t do this.\nALIONA: It’s already done, I’ve sent it.\nKYLO: It’s mass murder.\nALIONA: It’s the end of the war. Your family’s annihilated thousands, millions of my people. I’m not going to feel guilty about eradicating them in return.\nKYLO: But your family’s destroyed thousands of my people too!\nALIONA: That’s different. Your people deserved it.\nKYLO: (BEAT) What are you going to do to me?\nALIONA: Kill you. The moment I know my plan’s worked. One shot and straight out the airlock.\nKYLO: Why wait? You’ve killed me already, just finish the job.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 160\nALIONA: Oh no. I want you to know. Before you die. Know for certain your entire family’s gone. That they’re all dead. And it’s your fault.\nALIONA: Ooh — speaking of which, incoming message ...\nKYLO: What does it say? (ANGRIER) What does it say?\nALIONA: Good news, my love. They said my wedding day would be the happiest day of my life. They were right.\nKYLO: (GROWING ANGER) No...\nALIONA: The war’s over. My people operated the pulse weapon two minutes ago. Your father, your mother, your Aunts, Uncles, cousins, all of them, are dead. Dead. It’s done. House Sorsha is no more. (PAUSE) Nothing to say? That’s it? No last words for the last of the line?\nKYLO: No, not words. Not words. Word. Just one word.\nALIONA: One word? And what word is that?\nKYLO: (BEAT) Burn. BURN! (A CRY OF EFFORT) Yargh!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 161\nTUVOLD: It’s... it’s bigger on the inside...\nDOCTOR: I told you not to be distracted by that.\nTUVOLD: (BEAT) What... what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Programming our destination. It’s quite a small ship and it’s in flight, not the easiest target in the world... that’s before we even get to the TARDIS’ recent temperamental tendency... But then, how hard can a short hop be?\nTUVOLD: I wouldn’t know.\nDOCTOR: (LOUD, DEFENSIVE) I’m doing the best I can, Tegan!\nTUVOLD: Sorry?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) My apologies, I was expecting to be criticised, force of habit, I thought you were someone else.\nTUVOLD: We should probably —\nDOCTOR: Odd that, you know, because she hasn’t been around lately. Must be a nervous reaction because I’m heading back for her. Maybe I should make the journey more of a round trip...\nTUVOLD: Doctor, we should go.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Of course, yes. (HE FINISHES OFF THE BUTTONS) There we are, that’s the best I can do, we’ll have to hope it’s good enough. You ready?\nTUVOLD: Not really.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 162\nDOCTOR: Good man.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 163\nKYLO: I feel the burn inside me! I feel the fire!\nALIONA: But... but the psychic inhibitor...\nKYLO: It’s not enough! Not nearly enough! You woke it. Whatever it is inside my head, you woke it! Birthed it, nurtured it, made it grow. I’m too powerful now. Too powerful for you, your family, for anyone! They will all burn. If my family are dead everyone will burn!\nALIONA: No, my love, please, you can’t do this, not after all we’ve shared!\nKYLO: All the lies? All the untruths? (ALMOST TO HIMSELF) What is it you’ve used to bind me, eh? Just rope? Flammable rope?\nKYLO: That was careless, wasn’t it?\nALIONA: Kylo, please. Please don’t burn me!\nKYLO: Oh, I won’t. Far too quick.\nKYLO: What was it you said? You’d throw my body out this airlock? We’re a long way up. Right on the edge of the atmosphere,\nKYLO: wasn’t it. Quite a fall.\nALIONA: No.\nKYLO: I want to make you suffer. Like you made me suffer.\nALIONA: Don’t do this!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 164\nKYLO: Give me one good reason why not!\nALIONA: (DESPERATE) Because... because I love you!\nKYLO: You...?\nALIONA: Love you, yes. You know I do, please, my Prince.\nKYLO: (BEAT) This is a trick, you told me. You told me it was a lie.\nALIONA: It’s not. Look into your heart. Think about what you feel.\nKYLO: But... why — ?\nALIONA: I didn’t have a choice. Your people would never have accepted me. Think about what Corwyn did, the saboteurs on my ship.\nKYLO: I-\nALIONA: As long as two families existed there’d always have been hate. We could never have lived in peace. I needed to end the war.\nKYLO: But... but why my family, not yours?\nALIONA: Your family ignored you. Held you back, tortured you. Only mattering when you were the last son left.\nKYLO: That’s not true.\nALIONA: I am my family. Aren’t I worth more to you than them? Hold me, Kylo. Please. Hold me. Take me in your arms. I love you.\nKYLO: My love.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 165\nDOCTOR WHO: (KYLO WALKS ACROSS THE ROOM. HOLDS HER. KISSES HER. BREAKS APART)\nKYLO: Oh, my love, my love, what have you done? What have we both done? This war has destroyed us. We are one. We should be one.\nALIONA: I know.\nKYLO: I love you.\nALIONA: Love. (BEAT) Ah. Bless.\nALIONA: (WITH A CRY SHE SHOVES HIM INTO THE AIRLOCK. HITS A DOOR CONTROL, THE INNER DOOR SEALS)\nKYLO: (MUFFLED, BANGING AGAINST DOOR) Aliona! Aliona, what are you doing? Let me out of the airlock!\nALIONA: Say hello to your family, my Prince.\nKYLO: (PLUMMETTING AWAY) Noooooooo-!\nALIONA: ‘Love’. Ha!\nALIONA: (SHE HITS SOME CONTROLS. THE OUTER DOOR SEALS. THE TARDIS MATERIALISES IN A COMPARTMENT OFF)\nALIONA: What in Empire’s name...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 166\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OUT) Aliona! Aliona, it’s the Doctor! Kylo? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: Nothing.\nTUVOLD: What now?\nDOCTOR: Up there. The bridge.\nDOCTOR: Aliona! Where are you? Aliona!\nTUVOLD: Doctor! There, on the floor.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nTUVOLD: Is that his hand or hers?\nDOCTOR: Kylo’s.\nALIONA: (APPEARING BEHIND THEM) And you can stop right there. Turn around. I’ve enough charge in this laser for the pair of you.\nDOCTOR: You cut off his hand?\nALIONA: He offered it to me in marriage. It would have been churlish to refuse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 167\nTUVOLD: You evil - !\nALIONA: Now, now, Uncle. Don’t make me kill a member of my own family... Oh, you brought me my gun! How sweet...\nDOCTOR: I can’t allow you to use that thing on the Sorsha.\nALIONA: Oh, I don’t need to, they’re already dead.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTUVOLD: No.\nALIONA: The whole lot of them. Dead. I transmitted the signal ten minutes ago, House Sorsha no longer exists.\nDOCTOR: We’re too late?\nALIONA: From where I’m standing, you’re bang on time. Any earlier, you might have ruined it.\nTUVOLD: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We’re too late. We failed. She’s won.\nALIONA: Oh, don’t be too hard on yourself. This is a glorious day. You get to witness it.\nDOCTOR: Witness this abomination?\nALIONA: You call peace an abomination? Like I said, Doctor, you haven’t lived your life in wartime. You wouldn’t understand.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 168\nDOCTOR: I’ve spent more days in war than you’ve been alive, Princess, and I understand all too well.\nALIONA: The Sorsha are dead. All of them. Even Kylo. Kylo who fell so hard has fallen. Fallen to Sharnax.\nDOCTOR: You — ?\nALIONA: Threw him out of the airlock. He can’t gain anything from you now, corpses don’t feel gratitude, why make a stand of principle?\nDOCTOR: Because they’re dead. Someone has to.\nALIONA: (BEAT) I’11 forgive you your insolence. The Empress is generous in victory. You’re wise. There’s a place in my cabinet for you if you want it.\nDOCTOR: I'd rather rot.\nALIONA: That can be arranged. You, Uncle, standing there so silent. What about you? Must I kill you too?\nTUVOLD: One of your house, you’d do that? Your own blood?\nALIONA: What do you think?\nDOCTOR: Say something, Tuvold. You can’t seriously be considering this!\nTUVOLD: Can’t I? She’s right, Doctor. They’re gone. Why condemn my family to pain for the sake of the lost?\nDOCTOR: Because you’re a good man, Tuvold, you can’t agree.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 169\nTUVOLD: I don’t have a choice! Do you know what would happen to my wife, my wife and daughter, if I was named a traitor? What she’d do?\nDOCTOR: But —\nTUVOLD: Principles cost. You can afford them if you’ve nothing to lose, the rest of us don’t have that luxury.\nDOCTOR: Tuvold, please...\nTUVOLD: Your highness. I stand with you.\nALIONA: Excellent. Signal to the fleet. Inform them of my recovery and the death of the Prince. Order them to advance on the Sorsha homeworld, word must be out, there’ll only be a token resistance.\nDOCTOR: Tuvold, don’t do this.\nTUVOLD: I’m doing what I have to.\nALIONA: I’m sorry, Doctor. You could have been a great Gadarel.\nTUVOLD: Message sent.\nALIONA: Very well. Goodbye Doctor.\nTUVOLD: (INSISTENT) The message said Kylo and Aliona died on Sharnax.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 170\nALIONA: What?\nALIONA: You — you —\nTUVOLD: (WEAKLY) And that an immediate ceasefire is to be declared...\nTUVOLD: I’m sorry Aliona. We failed you. Somewhere... you were lost...\nALIONA: I should kill —\nALIONA: (HE BLASTS HER AGAIN. SHE DIES, THE CARCANET FALLS FROM HER HEAD AND ROLLS AWAY. THE DOCTOR RACES ACROSS THE ROOM TO TUVOLD, TRIES WHATEVER HE CAN TO KEEP HIM ALIVE)\nTUVOLD: Is she...?\nDOCTOR: She’s dead. Stay with me Tuvold, there must be a way to reverse\nDOCTOR: the effects...\nTUVOLD: I don’t think so. Don’t feel... well... Scanned myself, you see, your ship. Just in case. Couldn’t let her win. Couldn’t let her take over.\nDOCTOR: I know...\nTUVOLD: We’re family... the DNA code’s similar enough. It got her too...\nDOCTOR: You’re not dead yet, Tuvold, I can still save you.\nTUVOLD: Oh, I am dead, I’m gone.\nDOCTOR: I can still save one...\nTUVOLD: Listen to me, Doctor. It’s too late for me... but my daughter. Cheni. She’s out there.\nTUVOLD: in\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 171\nDOCTOR: Tuvold —\nTUVOLD: She’1ll be Empress now, she’s next in line. Look after her. Keep an eye on her.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know if I —\nTUVOLD: You can. Take Aliona’s carcanet, there, where it fell.\nDOCTOR: The Carcanet?\nDOCTOR: Such beautiful jewellery. On such an ugly soul.\nTUVOLD: The jewels were mined on Sharnax, you know? Back when the Empire was whole. Take it. Use it as a Royal Warranty. The ship’s recorder will prove who you are. Make sure Cheni keeps the Empire safe. Promise me this. Promise this to a dying man.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) I will.\nTUVOLD: Thank you Doctor. Thank - .\nDOCTOR: Just one? Would it have been too much to ask that I could have\nDOCTOR: just saved one? (WEARILY) Empire be praised. Empire be praised...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BURNING PRINCE by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 172\nDOCTOR WHO: (FADE UP. STAGNANT POOLS BUBBLE. UNKNOWN CREATURES SCUTTLE AND BELCH. )\nKYLO: (MOANS) Aliona..
