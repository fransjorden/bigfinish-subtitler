I am collecting samples in the third quadrant of sector nineteen.\nSCRYFAN: Sector nineteen? We hear a wolf howl in close proximity to SANCREDA.\nSCRYFAN: What was that?\nSANCREDA: Primitive indigenous scavengers. A pack of the creatures has been circling me for most of the day.\nSCRYFAN: Sancreda, it is imperative you return to the ship immediately. Meteorological conditions are deteriorating rapidly. We are under orders to return to the fleet at once.\nSANCREDA: There have been storms before.\nSCRYFAN: It is not a matter for discussion, Sancreda. The flagship has initiated automatic recall. The survey vessel is preparing for lift-off now, and I cannot halt the process. Return at once! Initiate immediate telekinetic transfer!\nSANCREDA: Very well, Scryfan.\nSANCREDA: With a loud snarl, a wolf lauches at SANCREDA. He cries in agony as he is savaged. He fires an alien weapon, and the wolf whimpers and dies.\nSCRYFAN: Sanereda? Sancreda, respond! What is happening?\nSANCREDA: lam... attacked...\nSANCREDA: The other wolves are circling him, growling.\nSCRYFAN: Are you wounded?\nSCRYFAN: SANCREDA A superficial lesion, nothing more. There is some loss of blood.\nSCRYFAN: Then it can be attended to when we have rejoined the fleet. Sancreda, you must return to the vessel at once! Countdown is commencing!\nSANCREDA: I... I cannot... I cannot achieve telekinetic transfer! SCRYFaNn What? How can that be? Check your focusing amplifier.\nSANCREDA: Scryfan! It is lost. The creatures have torn it from met\nSCRYFAN: Then you must run. Run for the ship! We are preparing for lift-off!\nSANCREDA: Very well. It will take more than a few primitive carnivores to stop me!\nSANCREDA: Dramatic music strikes up as SANCREDA begins running through the storm. Snarling wolves are leaping at him; he fires on them. Through the melee, a calm computer voice begins counting down. Music, wolves, gunfire, computer voice and dialogue pile on top of one another in the following sequence.\nSANCREDA: 93\nCOMPUTER: Automatic recall sequence initiated. Countdown to ignition in T minus fifteen seconds and counting. Fourteen, thirteen, twelve...\nSANCREDA: Postpone the countdown! I am nearly there!\nCOMPUTER: ..@leven, ten, nine, eight...\nSCRYFAN: Sancreda! Where are you? I cannot override the recall\nSCRYFAN: procedure!\nCOMPUTER: ...seven, six, five, four...\nCOMPUTER: We hear SANCREDA’s hoarse, panting breath, together with more wolves and gunfire.\nSANCREDA: Scryfan! Do not leave! Do not abandon me!\nCOMPUTER: . three, two, one...\nCOMPUTER: Engines firing for lift-off.\nCOMPUTER: _ ignition.\nSANCREDA: Seryfan! Scryfan, you have deserted me!\nSANCREDA: Spaceship taking off. We hear SCRYFAN’s laboured voice faintly but clearly through the snowstorm from SANCREDA’s P.O.V. — this will be important later.\nSCRYFAN: Farewell, my brother.\nSANCREDA: No, do not leave me! No! Woooccccoco!!\nSANCREDA: The music and his scream cross-fade into the tranquillity of the next scene.\nSANCREDA: SCENE 2: Ext. LANYON MOOR\nSANCREDA: Misty moorland in autumn. A light wind, a pheasant call or two. We hear birds taking flight in alarm as the TARDIS materialises. The door opens. A nice outdoor acoustic on all moorland scenes.\nEVELYN: Oh, marvellous.\nDOCTOR: (Muffled, from inside the TARDIS) What’s it like?\nEVELYN: You could have picked a better spot. We’re up to our necks in wet bracken!\nDOCTOR: (Emerging) 1 expect you’ll be needing a mackintosh, then.\nEVELYN: Thanks. Another highly desirable holiday destination, I see.\nDOCTOR: Evelyn, I didn’t choose to materialise here.\nEVELYN: (Aside, quietly) Now, why doesn’t that surprise me?\nDOCTOR: Some external force, interfering with the orientation circuits. We’ve been drawn off course.\nEVELYN: I've heard that one before.\nDOCTOR: Cgnoring her) Still, 1 rather like the look of it here.\nEVELYN: Oh, yes, terrific. It’s cold, it’s wet, it’s foggy, and it\nEVELYN: definitely isn’t the Galapagos Islands.’ We’re probably in the middle of post- apocalypse Bromsgrove in the ninety-fifth century. If this is Earth at all. DOCTOR Of course it’s Earth. Nowhere else in the cosmos has the same October mornings. And listen!\nEVELYN: He breaks off as we hear a clattering bird call.\nDOCTOR: There you are — pheasant.’\nEVELYN: Oh, come on then. Let's get out of the bracken at any rate.\nDOCTOR: That’s the spirit. We'll try this way.\nEVELYN: Why not? It looks by far the muddiest.\nEVELYN: We hear them fighting through wet bracken. Then silence.\nDOCTOR: There we are. What did I say?\nDOCTOR: 94\nEVELYN: What did you say?\nDOCTOR: Down there in the valley. I can see a church tower. Looks like a village.\nEVELYN: All right, Doctor, you win.\nDOCTOR: 1 expect this is a bridle-path. It can’t be more than a\nDOCTOR: couple of miles. Come on, we'll be there in time for breakfast. Splash as EVELYN steps in a muddy puddle.\nEVELYN: Urgh!\nEVELYN: DOCTOR And watch out for that puddle.\nEVELYN: Honestly, couldn't we just for once arrive somewhere in the middle of summer?\nEVELYN: pocToR Sshh!\nEVELYN: What?\nDOCTOR: (Sotto voce) There’s something on the path ahead of us. We hear distant snarling and growling.\nDOCTOR: When I give the word, back up the hill to the TARDIS. All right?\nEVELYN: Right.\nEVELYN: The snarls are getting nearer. Suddenly, from the same direction, we hear 4a plummy, upper-crust, elderly lady.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Buster! Buster! Ben!\nMRS: We hear 2 pair of panting, scampering cairn terriers, who have run ahead of their mistress and are yapping at the DOCTOR and EVELYN. MRS\nMOYNIHAN: arrives. She is a short, stumpy woman in her sixties, wearing wellingtons and 2 quilted anorak. Her hearty schoolgirl manner and unconvineingly dyed hair ill-conceal a careworn and rather bitter personality.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Heel, sir! Buster! Quiet, boy!\nMRS: The barking abates, but the dogs remain noticeable.\nDOCTOR: Good morning.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Good morning to you! I say, early birds, eh? Going to see the fogou?\nMRS: EVELYN The wha - ?\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s right.' I hear it’s a particularly fascinating example.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN They do say so. Well, fork left just down there and then it’s up the hill in front of you. Buster!\nMRS: DOCTOR And this path goes straight on down to, er...?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Pengriffen? Yes, straight down the path and it comes out behind the schoo]. Golly gosh, don’t tell me you've yomped all the way over the hill from Tremayne?\nEVELYN: Yes, that’s right. Nothing like a jolly old yomp before breakfast.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN My thoughts entirely. Well, good day! Buster, don’t do that. Ben! Goodbye!’\nMRS: The sound of the dogs recedes into the distance.. The DOCTOR’s and EVELYN’s squishy footsteps resume and continue during the following dialogue.\nEVELYN: All right, Doctor, I admit it’s Earth. No other planet could produce more than one Joyce Grenfell.\nDOCTOR: I can do better than that. We’re in England. Cornwall to\nDOCTOR: be precise. Probably west of the river Fal.\nEVELYN: How on earth could you Know that?\nEVELYN: 95\nDOCTOR: Pengriffen? Tremayne?\nEVELYN: Oh, I get it. ‘By Tre, Pol and Pen, ye shall know Cornishmen’. ;\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Ancient Cornish prefixes.\nBVELYN: Not exactly cast-iron evidence.\nDOCTOR: True. But then there’s the fogou.\nEVELYN: Yes, I was going to ask you about that. Some sort of ancient monument, is it?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR And an unusual one at that. A fogou is an underground\nEVELYN: passage built by Iron Age man. They’re unique to the far west of Cornwall.\nEVELYN: Not my period at all. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Mmm?\nEVELYN: How is it, when you’ve been to so many planets in so\nEVELYN: many different galaxies, you always seem to know more about this one than I do?\nDOCTOR: I suppose I just read a lot of history books.\nEVELYN: You rotter!\nEVELYN: Their footsteps stop.\nDOCTOR: Ah, here we are. Fork in the track. Fogou up there... EVELYN And breakfast down there.\nDOCTOR: Let’s have a quick look, shall we? I haven’t seen a decent Cornish fogou for centuries.\nEVELYN: Oh, same here. (Reluctantly) All right, come on then. Just @ Quick look, and then it’s straight down the hill for scrambled eggs on toast.\nDOCTOR: I promise.\nEVELYN: Is that it?\nDOCTOR: Is what it?\nEVELYN: Up there. There’s a sort of mound on the ridge of the hill.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. No, that’s not it. That’s a Neolithic tumulus. EVELYN Of course it is. So where’s the — what's it called again?\nDOCTOR: Fogou.\nEVELYN: Fogou. Where’s the fogou?\nDOCTOR: They're not always that easy to spot. They tend to be — ah! Got it!\nEVELYN: Where?\nDOCTOR: (Voice receding; footsteps) Over here. Come on!\nEVELYN: Oh, splendid. More bracken.\nEVELYN: SCENE 3: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nEVELYN: A large room in a pleasant old country house. Computer keys being typed at speed. A crackling sound, rather like a Geiger counter. LUDGATE, a young archeaology postgraduate in his mid twenties, is alone with the tracking equipment.\nLUDGATE: CMurmuring to himself) There it is again... Door opens. PROFESSOR MORGAN is in his mid forties, genial, self- confident and extremely Welsh.\nMORGAN: Ah, Mr Ludgate. Still enjoying the new toy?\nLUDGATE: _It’s responding again, Professor. Definitely some sort of electrical activity up on the Moor.\nLUDGATE: MORGAN The only electrical activity around here takes place in\nLUDGATE: 96\nLUDGATE: your overheated brain, Mr Ludgate. One day you’ll resign yourself to the plain fact that ninety-nine percent of archaeological work is carried out not with a computing machine, but with a trowel. Now, I want some coffee. Where’s Mrs Moynihan?\nLUDGATE: She’s out walking the dogs.\nMORGAN: Hell's bells, it’s rank mutiny. Everyone’s deserting their posts. I don’t suppose the Brigadier has put in an appearance this morning?\nLUDGATE: Not yet. Um, Professor...\nMORGAN: Yes, what d’you want? You always want something when you start with ‘Um, Professor’.\nLUDGATE: It’s these readings. If you don’t mind, I think I'll just nip\nLUDGATE: out with some of the portable gear and see if I can make any sense of things up at the dig.\nLUDGATE: MORGAN The day we make any sense of things on this survey is the day I get my knighthood. Yes, fine, off you go. I’ll stay here and take any messages while you’re all out.\nLUDGATE: Thanks, Professor. I’ll only be twenty minutes.\nLUDGATE: SCENE 4: Ext. OUTSIDE THE FOGOU The DOCTOR and EVELYN have reached the entrance of the fogou, and are looking inside.\nDOCTOR: Well, what do you think?\nEVELYN: It's rather impressive. Shine your torch up there again.\nDOCTOR: Look at the craftsmanship. See how the walls are corbelled upwards to meet the roof slabs.\nEVELYN: So this would be Celtic, would it?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Round about the first century BC.\nEVELYN: Amazing, really, isn’t it? People think of the Celts as being not much more than cavemen.\nDOCTOR: Nothing primitive about Celtic society. They were a highly\nDOCTOR: sophisticated civilisation.\nEVELYN: Tin-miners, weren't they?\nDOCTOR: Well, tin-streamers to be pedantic. Here in Cornwall they controlled an international industry with customers stretching right down to the Mediterranean. Not that it was Cornwall at the time, of course. The Greeks called it Belerion.\nEVELYN: So that tumulus up on the hill, that’s presumably a lot older.\nDOCTOR: Ob yes.” That’s a chambered tomb from the New Stone\nDOCTOR: Age. Probably already disused two and a half thousand years before the fogou was built. If you think about it, there’s as great a gap between them as there is between this fogou and the Sydney Opera House.\nEVELYN: What's it for?\nDOCTOR: Nobody’s quite certain. The original idea was to stage operas there, but nowadays it’s just used for photo-opportunities by the New South Wales Tourist Board.\nEVELYN: Not Sydney Opera House, you clot — this!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, likewise, nobody really knows. There’s a theory that they were used for storing grain.\nEVELYN: Seems an awful lot of trouble to go to just for that.\nEVELYN: 7\nDOCTOR: True, but some archaeologists think the fogous were also used as defensive stockades. Others believe they had some sort of religious significance. The truth is we'll probably never know. Maybe I'l go back sometime and find out. Fancy a look inside?\nBVELYN: Why not?\nBVELYN: SCENE 5: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE The external door opens, muffled because it’s in the adjoining hallway.\nMORGAN: (To himself) At last. (Out loud) Mrs Moynihan, what kept you?\nMORGAN: Inner door opens. P ;\nMORGAN: Oh, I beg your pardon. Morning, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Good day, Professor Morgan. .\nMORGAN: I was hoping you might put in an appearance this\nMORGAN: morning. The thing is, we're even more short-staffed than usual today, and I've got quite a backlog to get through.\nBRIGADIER: Don’t you worry on my account, Professor, I won’t be getting in your way.\nMORGAN: Well, no, as a matter of fact I was wondering whether you might be able to lend me a hand with some classification work until Mr Ludgate gets back.\nBRIGADIER: If that's what you'd like I’d be only too delighted, Professor. Although I should warn you I’m no kind of expert.\nMORGAN: That’s quite all right. I just want you to sort things into cardboard boxes according to my instructions.\nMORGAN: BRIGADIER In that case, Professor Morgan, I'm your man.\nMORGAN: Thank you very much, Brigadier. What with our resident whiz2-kid intent on dragging us into the computer age, and that idiot Leamington-Smith swanning off to Princeton to read his paper at the megalithic symposium, it’s a great relief to find someone who's actually prepared to do what I say.\nBRIGADIER: Well, Professor, where do we start?\nMORGAN: Pottery fragments from site 33. Six trays marked A to F. You with me so far?\nBRIGADIER: = 1’1l tell you when you're going too quickly for me.\nMORGAN: Good man.\nBRIGADIER: Incidentally, where’s Mrs Moynihan? No, don’t tell me - walking the dogs.\nMORGAN: How did you guess?\nBRIGADIER: Wo chance of a cup of coffee then.\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 6: Int. INSIDE THE FOGOU\nBRIGADIER: The DOCTOR and EVELYN are now inside the chamber. We need a close acoustic on their voices as though in a claustrophobic, rather damp stone cellar. Fogous are not big and echoing; they are stuffy and dank.\nEVELYN: How far back does this thing go?\nDOCTOR: (Voice disppearing into the passage ahead) Some of them extend a good fifty or sixty feet.\nEVELYN: ! Hang on, come back with the torch. I can’t see where I'm treading,\nEVELYN: 98\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, the floor’s level.\nDOCTOR: A hard bump and a muffled ory from THE DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The ceiling gets a bit lower along here, though.\nEVELYN: Hey, come back here a moment. I think I’ve found a fossil or something.\nEVELYN: We hear a small stone being picked up.\nDOCTOR: What sort of fossil?\nEVELYN: Well, I don’t know until you point the torch at it. (He does) Oh, it’s just a funny-shaped pebble.\nDOCTOR: Let me see that. Mm.\nEVELYN: D'you think it’s man-made?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Pebbles don’t usually have holes in them, do they? I'd hang on to that if I were you.\nEVELYN: All right.\nEVELYN: We hear EVELYN stowing it in her handbag.\nBVELYN: So, what’s at the end of the tunnel?\nDOCTOR: If I knew the answer to that sort of question, I think on\nDOCTOR: the whole I'd get into a lot less trouble. But as far as fogous are concerned, the tunnel is usually all there is. There’s often a secondary passage leading off at right angles — ah! There we are.\nBVELYN: Hey, what was that? Shine it there again. See? There’s a figure carved in the lintel.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. Some sort of protective deity, perhaps.\nEVELYN: Either that or an Iron Age ‘mind your head’ sign.\nDOCTOR: One or the other.\nEVELYN: He's got a tail!\nDOCTOR: So he has.\nLUDGATE: (Distant, from outside the fogou) Hey, you! What are you doing in there?\nLUDGATE: pDOocTOR (Aside) Hello - sounds like we're not welcome. (Aloud)\nLUDGATE: dust having a look around!\nLUDGATE: Well, come out of there! It’s not safe!\nDOCTOR: Not safe? Nonsense, it’s been here for centuries.\nEVELYN: Come on, Doctor. Let’s do as he says.\nEVELYN: We hear them scrambling on rock as they climb out of the fogou. Change acoustic to outdoors and open moorland as we move into...\nEVELYN: SCENE 7: Ext. OUTSIDE THE FOGOU\nEVELYN: The moor. LUDGATE’s Geiger counter-type sound effects are crackling gently in the background. Serambling on rocks as the DOCTOR and\nEVELYN: emerge from the fogou.\nLUDGATE: Here, take my hand.\nEVELYN: That's very kind of you, er —- ?\nLUDGATE: Philip. Philip Ludgate.\nEVELYN: That's very kind of you, Philip.\nLUDGATE: Well, that settles it. I told the professor we should have put up some sort of warning sign.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what you think is so dangerous, young\nDOCTOR: man — hello! You’re getting some very high readings, Mr Ludgate!\nLUDGATE: My point exactly.\nDOCTOR: Seven point four. That’s most unusual for a granite upland.\nDOCTOR: 99\nLUDGATE: You're familiar with geo-electrical isography?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I get by. :\nLUDGATE: Look, why don’t you both come down to the Institute? Have you had breakfast yet?\nEVELYN: No, we haven't. What Institute would that be?\nLUDGATE: It’s where I work. Lanyon Moor Archaeological Institute. Nowhere near as grand as it sounds, I'm afraid.\nDOCTOR: You’re an archaeologist?\nLUDGATE: Certainly am. Or at least I will be, once I’ve finished my Ph.D. I’m modern archaeology’s antidote to the old trowel-scrapers.\nDOCTOR: Indeed? Well, Mr Ludgate, I should very much like to see your Institute, and if possible meet the old trowel-scrapers for myself.\nEVELYN: Did you say Lanyon Moor?\nLUDGATE: That’s right. New to the area?\nEVELYN: You could say that.\nLUDGATE: Well, all of this is Lanyon Moor, right across to Tremayne five miles that-a-way. It was occupied by early man right from the time of the first Neolithic settlers.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nLUDGATE: Anyway, the Institute’s this way. We’re barracked up in an old gamekeeper’s lodge, about half a mile down the hill.\nDOCTOR: Lead the way, Mr Ludgate. Come on, Evelyn, keep up.\nEVELYN: (To herself) Lanyon Moor... where have I heard that before?\nEVELYN: SCENE 8: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE MORGAN and the BRIGADIER are as we left them. We hear shards of pottery being sorted in cardboard boxes.\nEVELYN: MORGAN And finally... Romano-British — at a stab, circa AD 100.\nEVELYN: So, tray D for that one, thank you, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Glad to be of service, Professor.\nMORGAN: Right, now I’ve got some fascinating lumps of rusty metal\nMORGAN: for you to look at.\nMORGAN: Door opens. MRS MOYNIHAN arrives, ‘jolly-hockey-sticks’ as always,\nMORGAN: accompanied by her yapping terriers.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Morning, gentlemen!”\nMORGAN: Mrs Moynihan, thank heavens. You see before you two\nMORGAN: dying men. A large pot of strong coffee at your earliest convenience, if\nMORGAN: you please.\nMES: MOYNIHAN Golly-Moses! If you men can’t even put the kettle on\nMES: by yourselves, how are you going to cope while I’m away?\nMORGAN: Oh, don’t worry, I’m sure Mr Ludgate is as proficient with\nMORGAN: a cafetiére as he is with a computer. Mrs Moynihan, I’m sure we all adore\nMORGAN: the delightful mutts, but you really must keep them out of here. I’ve got\nMORGAN: velnenle specimen trays all over the place. Will you get off my leg, you le...\nMES: MOYNIHAN Buster! Buster, down! Bad boy! (The dog obeys) There\nMES: We are, you see. What a lot of fuss about nothing. One pot of coffee coming\nMES: a come on, Buster! Through here! Away from the nasty man! Yes!\nMES: loses.\nMORGAN: Til strangle those little blighters one day, I swear it.\nMORGAN: 100\nMORGAN: Door opens.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I heard that. Somebody here to see you, Professor Morgan.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD FLINT is elderly and genial, but has a hard side.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Professor!\nMORGAN: Sir Archibald, good morning! You know the Brigadier, don’t you?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Yes, we’ve met. Good morning, Brigadier.’\nBRIGADIER: Good morning, sir\"!\nMORGAN: Have a seat, if you can find one among the wreckage.'? To what do we owe this honour?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh, I thought I’d just drop by and see how things are going. Any news on the spectre of Lanyon Moor?\nSIR: BRIGADIER The what?\nMORGAN: He means these electrical discharges the boy keeps picking up on his ground survey, Brigadier. I’m afraid you've come at the wrong time, Sir Archibald.\" At this very moment Mr Ludgate is out there on the moor, gathering evidence for his increasingly deranged theories. He's been gone nearly half an hour, so I expect by now he’ll have spotted a swarm of UFOs, discovered the Loch Ness Monster, and solved the Mystery of the pyramids\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Do I detect a hint of scepticism?\nMORGAN: Well, really. For someone who calls himself a scientist, that young man is one of the most credulous characters I've ever come across.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I'm not so sure, Professor. I think we can all learn a great deal from the new methods. Who knows, this electrical business might have something to do with — I don’t know, precious metals buried under the ground, or magnetism, or something. Not a boffin myself, as you know, but I’m prepared to give the boy a fair hearing.\nSIR: We hear distant gravel being crunched outside.\nBRIGADIER: You can give him a hearing now if you like, sir He’s coming up the back path.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Who the devil’s that with him? Tall fellow in the most extraordinary coat, and he’s got a rather handsome lady with him as well\nMORGAN: More waifs and strays, no doubt.\nMORGAN: We hear the exterior door opening and a general chatter as LUDGATE ushers the DOCTOR and EVELYN into the adjacent hallway.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I hope you don’t include me in that category, Professor. MORGAN Of course not, Sir Archibald. You know you're always welcome here.\nSIR: Inner door opens.\nDOCTOR: Hello, everyone! I can smell coffee.”\nLUDGATE: Um, allow me to introduce the, er...\nDOCTOR: Brigadier!\nLUDGATE: Oh, have you two met before?\nDOCTOR: We most certainly have. Lethbridge-Stewart, you old\nDOCTOR: rogue, how are you?\nBRIGADIER: I’m extremely well, thank you.\nDOCTOR: You... know who I am?\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER To judge by the clothes, the unexpected arrival, and the\nDOCTOR: 101\nDOCTOR: manner of your greeting, I can only conclude that I know exactly who you are. I take it there’s a police box somewhere in the vicinity.\nDOCTOR: You're getting better at this, aren’t you, Brigadier?\nBRIGADIER: Well, I’ve had some experience, haven’t I? It’s good to see you, Doctor.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR And what are you doing here?\nBRIGADIER: il in good time. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?\nDOCTOR: I’m so sorry. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, allow me to —\nEVELYN: Evelyn Smythe. Delighted to meet you.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER The pleasure’s mine, Miss Smythe. Or is it Mrs Smythe?\nEVELYN: It’s Dr Smythe, actually, but you don't have to call me that.\nMORGAN: Both of you doctors, eh?\nLUDGATE: Er, Doctor, this is Professor Morgan, head of the Institute.\nDOCTOR: Delighted to meet you, Professor.\nMORGAN: Likewise, ’m sure. A Doctor of what, if I may make so bold?\nDOCTOR: Oh, this and that. Mostly that, you know. Just at the\nDOCTOR: moment I’m very interested in fogous. We were exploring yours when we met your colleague here.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Since we’re making introductions, ’'m Flint.\nLUDGATE: I'm so sorry, Sir Archibald, I didn’t see you there.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD That’s quite all right, young man.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, Evelyn - this is Sir Archibald Flint, thirteenth Baronet of Pengriffen.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Charmed, Dr Smythe. Er, I didn’t catch your name, Doctor...?\nEVELYN: Are you an archaeologist too, Sir Archibald?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Good Lord, no. No, to resort to a current vulgarity, I am the money.\nMORGAN: Sir Archibald owns Pengriffen Manor and most of the moorland around here. Not only has he very kindly let us use this lodge as our premises, but he's also funded most of our work for the past six months.\nLUDGATE: We only get a tiny grant, you see. We’re very lucky to have a benefactor like Sir Archibald right on our doorstep.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Always delighted to assist a committed cause, gentlemen, you know that. I’m only sorry you haven’t found anything terribly interesting on your dig. Well, just a passing visit, I must press on. I'll see myself out. Good day to you all! ieee Good day, Sir Archibald. Always good to see you.\nSIR: oor.\nEVELYN: He seems very nice.\nLUDGATE: Bit of a funny old buffer, is Archie, but we wouldn’t be here without him.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN And was it right, what he said?\nLUDGATE: About what?\nEVELYN: That you haven’t found anything terribly interesting.\nMORGAN: Tm afraid so, Dr Smythe. Plenty of standard fare, all good St ter ine county museum, but nothing that’s likely to set the academic ablaze.\nMORGAN: 102\nMORGAN: DOCTOR On the contrary, Professor, I think this may yet prove to be one of the most fascinating surveys ever undertaken.\nMORGAN: Indeed? What makes you say that?\nDOCTOR: For one thing, the contents of this box.\nDOCTOR: We hear him pick up a cardboard box full of scraps of metal.\nMORGAN: Careful, those haven't been classified yet. Don’t get them mixed up with the others!\nDOCTOR: Where was this found?\nDOCTOR: MORGAN In a cremation cist a couple of hundred yards from the tumulus on top of the hill. Why?\nDOCTOR: Extraordinary.\nLUDGATE: Not particularly. It’s just a bronze axe-head. Pretty straightforward Beaker Period stuff.\nDOCTOR: Well, I lack your expertise, of course, and with this amount of corrosion it’s difficult to be certain, but...\nEVELYN: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: What else have you found at the cremation site?\nLUDGATE: Nothing out of the ordinary. Hairpins, jewellery, remnants of leather and wool. A few charred bones, of course.\nDOCTOR: Can I see them?\nLUDGATE: What, the bones?\nDOCTOR: Everything.\nMORGAN: May I ask why, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just idle curiosity.\nMORGAN: Then I’m afraid the answer is no, you may not. It’s been\nMORGAN: most pleasant to meet you, Doctor, but I’m sure you will appreciate I have a survey to run here, and we're already badly behind schedule. Now if you go across the hall into the kitchen, Mrs Moynihan will make you a Nice cup of coffee before you go. Good day to you.\nMORGAN: pocTOR Now, you listen to me, Professor. The equipment your young colleague here is using to survey the historical disturbance of the terrain has been picking up far more than the usual background radiation. Somewhere on that moor, something is emitting phased electrical pulses. This is not the remains of a bronze axe-head, it’s a fragment of molectic-bonded dissilum corroded by the extreme cold of deep space. And if I’m right, what's happening up on that hill could be the beginning of something far more dangerous than you can possibly comprehend. Now if you don’t mind, I’d very much like to see what else you’ve dug up.\nMORGAN: MORGAN With the greatest respect, Doctor, I’m sorry to have to tell you that you’re talking utter rubbish. I know the nonsense Mr Ludgate’s been filling your head with, and he’s obviously found a kindred spirit, but I have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge so much as another minute of this ridiculous poppycock. Mr Ludgate, will you kindly see your friends out.\nBRIGADIER: Just one moment, Professor. As it happens, the Doctor is\nBRIGADIER: a respected government employee of many years’ standing, and I propose\nBRIGADIER: to enlist his help in my current work.\nMORGAN: Oh, marvellous. May I remind you, Brigadier, that you are\nMORGAN: here on an entirely unofficial basis?\nMORGAN: BRIGADIER And may I remind you, Professor Morgan, what it would\nMORGAN: mean to your survey if I were to make my presence here official?\nMORGAN: 103,\nMORGAN: A beat.\nMORGAN: Oh, very well, Brigadier. Have it your own way. But if you people get under my nose I shall be quite prepared to make an official complaint.\nMORGAN: Door.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN (Cheerily) Sorry about the delay. I've been trying to keep count of all the comings and goings. Coffee for five, is it? 7 f\nMORGAN: Ah, the voice of sanity. Thank you, Mrs Moynihan. Tm going to have mine on the terrace while this sun’s still shining. Bring it out to me there, will you?”\nMORGAN: His voice is receding.\nMORGAN: Oh, and Mr Ludgate, you’d better show them whatever damn things they want to see.\nLUDGATE: Will do.\nLUDGATE: Door slams. We hear coffee being served in the background during the following dialogue. .\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, Evelyn, this is Mrs Moynihan.\nDOCTOR: Yes, we met on the moor this morning.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Indeed we did! I was taking Buster and Ben out for one last run.\nLUDGATE: She's off to sunnier climes today, aren’t you, Mrs M?\nMBS: MOYNIHAN That’s right. I’m all packed and the taxi’s coming at eleven-thirty. I should be at Heathrow by six. I’ve just said goodbye to the doggies.\nEVELYN: Are they going into kennels?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Oh no, I could never do that. No, a neighbour’s coming into my cottage to look after them. Oh, what a pretty little stone.\nEVELYN: Do you like it? I picked it up in the fogou this morning.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Unusual shape. Well, 1 can’t diddle about here. I'd better get a move on.\nLUDGATE: We expect a postcard by Tuesday at the latest.\nMRS: MOYNIBAN I'll do my best, Philip.\nEVELYN: Where are you going?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Greece, dear. A week in Athens to begin with, and then I’m touring the islands. I’m not half so clever as these boys, of course, but I'm so looking forward to seeing the Parthenon and what-have-you.\nDOCTOR: I've always meant to pop back and see it now that it’s finished.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Strange sense of humour. Well, I’d better take the Professor's coffee outside. The taxi will be here any minute, so if I don’t see you again before I go — goodbyel'®\nMRS: Open and close door.\nEVELYN: She’s a curious one, isn’t she?\nEVELYN: LUDGATE To be honest she’s a bit of a sad case. Apparently her husband ran off with his secretary years and years ago. And then I think her daughter married someone she didn’t approve of, or something, and\nEVELYN: they lost touch too. I always get the impression she’s rather bitter underneath all that enforced jollity.\nDOCTOR: Mr Ludgate, I wonder if I might see the other samples from that burial chamber.\nLUDGATE: Oh yes, of course. I'll go and have a rummage. Back in a tick. Open and close door.\nLUDGATE: 104\nDOCTOR: So tell me, Brigadier, what on Earth are you doing here?\nBRIGADIER: Officially, I'm on holiday. Doris has relatives in the South- West.\nDOCTOR: Doris?\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Of course, you haven't met my wife, have you?\nDOCTOR: Your wife?\nBRIGADIER: Well, don’t sound so surprised, Doctor. We don’t all run off with our secretaries, you know.\nDOCTOR: Good gracious.\nEVELYN: What about unofficially?\nBRIGADIER: 1 beg your pardon, Dr Smythe?\nEVELYN: You said you were on holiday ‘officially’.\nBRIGADIER: Ah yes. Well, Doris is with the in-laws up in Devon, while unofficially, and I hope you understand this is classified information, I’m down here doing a spot of surveillance.\nDOCTOR: I thought you’d retired.\nBRIGADIER: You know what they say about old soldiers, Doctor. Every now and then I'm asked to do a bit of undercover work, and every now and then I say yes.\nDOCTOR: So what’s UNIT’s interest in this survey?\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor — Doctors. Back in 1940 Lanyon Moor was occupied by the Royal Navy, for use as a radar observation post. They put up huts on the hill, but they had to abandon the site within a couple of months.\nEVELYN: Why, what happened?\nBRIGADIER: Well, for one thing the radar equipment was completely useless — everything was permanently scrambled. Chaps from the War Office came down - experts and so forth - but they couldn’t get to the bottom of it.\nDOCTOR: What else?\nBRIGADIER: There was some sort of wave of mental illness among the men. It seems people were just losing their marbles, wandering off onto the moors. One poor fellow even went over a cliff and ended up in pieces at the bottom. Well, not surprisingly, the Admiralty didn't want to make too much noise about it, so they quietly shut the place down and moved the station twenty miles up the coast.\nBRIGADIER: EVELYN And now things are happening here again?\nBRIGADIER: Well, nothing quite so serious, touch wood, Dr Smythe. But a couple of weeks ago one of Professor Morgan's assistants had some sort of breakdown at the fogou, and ended up in hospital.\nDOCTOR: So that’s why Mr Ludgate was so keen to bundle us out of there. And now UNIT have got you hanging around and keeping an eye on things, eh?\nBRIGADIER: Exactly, Doctor. Unofficially. Professor Morgan knows all about it. He and young Ludgate have signed the Official Secrets Act. Everyone else thinks I'm just a friend of Morgan’s. A retired warhorse on holiday.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR And you're living here?\nBRIGADIER: Not at the Institute, no. I’m at the Pengriffen Arms, a very good pub just down the road.\nBRIGADIER: Door opens. We hear a crate full of specimen trays being brought in and put down.\nBRIGADIER: 105\nLUDGATE: Right. These trays are all from the same cremation cist. These two are fabric, this lot’s all pottery, this one’s bone fragments, and you've seen the metal already.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Mr Ludgate. Evelyn, while I’m looking through this lot there’s something I’d like you to do.\nEVELYN: Have breakfast?\nDOCTOR: If you insist. Then I wonder if you could help me with some good old-fashioned research.\nEVELYN: Like what?\nEVELYN: DOcTOR Find out anything you can about the history of this place.\nEVELYN: Pengriffen, Tremayne, Lanyon Moor in particular. Local history, folklore, anything at all connected with the area, as far back as you can go.\nEVELYN: Right. Is there a local library, Philip?\nLUDGATE: Nearest one’s in Penzance, but you’d be better off paying a visit to the Manor house. Sir Archibald’s got a fantastic library, and ’m sure he’ll be more than happy to let you have a browse.\nBRIGADIER: Yes, indeed. One of his ancestors was a genuine eighteenth-century antiquarian. There are whole rooms piled with books in that house.\nEVELYN: Sounds ideal. Well then, I'll go straight over. How do I find it?\nLUDGATE: It’s a mile or so across the moor. Actually, if you’re quick you could catch a lift in Mrs Moynihan’s taxi. (Calls) Mrs Moynihan!'”\nBVELYN: T'll report back before evening, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good girl, Evelyn. We'll meet here at seven.\nLUDGATE: Well, Doctor, if I don’t get back to work, Professor Morgan will probably have a seizure. Is there anything else I can get you?\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Mr Ludgate, the Brigadier and I have quite enough to be going on with here.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 9: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR\nDOCTOR: Echoing footsteps in a large stone-flagged country manor. A slightly echoing acoustic on the voices too.\nEVELYN: This is very kind of you, Sir Archibald.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Not at all, Dr Smythe. It is a pleasure to have such a charming visitor. I'm afraid my butler is away visiting his mother this weekend, so I shall have to do my poor best to look after you myself. The library is this way.\nSIR: Footsteps through the hall during this dialogue.\nEVELYN: It’s a very impressive house. Elizabethan, isn’t it?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Spot on, my dear - 1571. The architect was Sir John Arundell. His gabled facade is the earliest of its kind in the country.\nEVELYN: It’s a beautiful hallway.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD And here's our famous window, you see. Five hundred and seventy-six individual panes, most of them original.\nEVELYN: That’s quite something.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD The window-cleaner detests it, of course.\nEVELYN: Has the house always been in your family, Sir Archibald?\nSTR: ARCHIBALD Only since the seventeenth century. It was a gift from\nSTR: Charles II in recognition of our support during the Civil War. Now, here we are.\nSTR: 106\nSTR: A heavy door is opened,\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Some of these bookcases may be a little dusty, I fear.\nEVELYN: Oh, I can cope with a bit of dust.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD That's the spirit. Well, if you’ll excuse me, Dr Smythe, I usually have my little rest at around this hour. Time’s wingéd chariot and all that, you know. Do make yourself at home in the kitchens, and feel free to use the telephone of course. I shall return, much refreshed, in a couple of hours, when perhaps you'll do me the honour of joining me for afternoon tea.\nEVELYN: Thank you very much, Sir Archibald.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD is departing.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD The pleasure is mine. Nice to have a young face around the place again. Good hunting!\nEVELYN: I hope so. A door closes heavily.\nEVELYN: Young face! It’s a while since anyone described me as\nEVELYN: that. Oh, hang about, I should have asked him where the history books are.\nEVELYN: We hear her reopen the door with a creak.\nEVELYN: Sir Archibald, I wonder if you could tell - (a beat) Well how extraordinary, where’s he shot off to so quickly? Oh well, I'll find it.\" Now, where are we? History, history, history - ah, History! Huropean history, military history, history of exploration ~ local history. Here we go.\nEVELYN: She opens a glass cabinet and begins pulling books out.\nEVELYN: (Coughing) He wasn’t joking about the dust, was he?\nEVELYN: SCENE 10: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, any joy?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure about joy, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Why, what have you found in the Professor’s specimen\nBRIGADIER: trays? Irrefutable evidence of imps and goblins?\nDOCTOR: Cintrigued) What makes you say that?\nBRIGADIER: 0h, just the local hocus-pocus, you know. Cornish pixies\nBRIGADIER: and so forth. They lay it on rather thick for the tourists around here.\nDOCTOR: Do they?\nBRIGADIER: Oh yes. Apparently the local name for the fogou is ‘the\nBRIGADIER: Pixies’ Hall’. Supposed to be traditional, but it sounds to me like a bit of\nBRIGADIER: nonsense cooked up by the Victorians. They were great ones for all that\nBRIGADIER: stuff about the fairy folk, weren't they?\nDOCTOR: ‘Up the airy mountain, down the rushy glen, We daren't go a-hunting, for fear of little men.’\nBRIGADIER: Exactly. That’s the sort of thing. A good old bit of\nBRIGADIER: 9\nBRIGADIER: bunkum.\nDOCTOR: Yes, possibly. Come on, Brigadier, get your coat.\nBRIGADIER: Why, where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Up to the fogou. There’s something I want to take a look at.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR\nEVELYN: is on the telephone.\nEVELYN: 107\nEVELYN: ‘And there it was —- Lanyon Moor. I knew I’d heard of it somewhere along the line. Thank you very much, Gareth. Nice to double- check. All right then. Next time I’m in town I’ll call you up and we'll have dinner at Magdalen. All right then. Bye!\nEVELYN: Phone down ~ it’s probably an old-fashioned dialler.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Have your researches been fruitful, Dr Smythe?\nEVELYN: Oh! Sir Archibald, I didn’t hear you come in. You gave me quite a fright.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I’m so sorry, my dear. I do apologise. I had no idea I was still capable of sneaking about at my age. Can I tempt you to another pot of tea?\nEVELYN: No thank you. You’ve been most kind and you’ve kept me well fed all day, but I really think it’s about time I made tracks.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Would that I could offer you a lift, my dear, but I’m afraid my butler is also my chauffeur.\nEVELYN: That’s perfectly all right. I rather fancy a breath of fresh air anyway.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Yes, I see you found the dust. I only hope it has been worthwhile.\nEVELYN: I think so, yes. I’ve made quite a few notes, anyway.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Good. Well, Dr Smythe, you’re welcome to stay as long as you wish, but if you are contemplating a return on foot, I should advise you to set off directly. Dusk is approaching and night falls very quickly on the moor.\nEVELYN: That’s a point. I just keep to the track, do I?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD That’s right. A couple of hundred yards beyond the gatehouse it joins the old Tinner’s Way, and you follow that straight down to the village. There’s quite a mist rising, so do make sure you stay on the path, won\"t you?\nEVELYN: I will. Well, thank you again, Sir Archibald. You've been most kind.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Come back whenever you like, Dr Smythe. It has been a great pleasure. Goodbye.\nEVELYN: Goodbye!\nEVELYN: A big oak door creaks shut. We are still inside the hall.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Ah, there you are. Yes, I thought I heard you lurking in the shadows. Well, I think we may have a problem. This Smythe woman, and her friend the Doctor. They both seem far too inquisitive for their own good. Come with me; we must prepare for tonight’s experiment. Brisk footsteps, belying SIR ARCHIBALD’s supposed infirmity.\nSIR: SCENE 12: Int. INSIDE THE FOGOU\nBRIGADIER: What exactly is it you're looking for, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I won’t really know until I find it.\nDOCTOR: SU GaDISR Well, in the meantime, can’t you tell me what’s on your\nDOCTOR: Oh, the human race, Brigadier. The human race.\nBRIGADIER: Would you care to be a little more forthcoming?\nDOCTOR: Folklore can tell us a great deal about the workings of the\nDOCTOR: mind, the concerns and pressures incumbent on different civilisations.\nBRIGADIER: I suppose it can, yes.\nBRIGADIER: 108\nDOCTOR: Well, doesn’t it strike you as even mildly interesting that this place is said to be haunted by imps and pixies?\nBRIGADIER: But surely, Doctor, that’s just the sort of thing that’s attached to every ancient site in the British Isles. If it’s not pixies it’s giants, or witches, or the devil turning people to stone for dancing on the Sabbath. Jolly good bedtime stories, but no more than that.\nDOCTOR: We both know from experience that that’s not always the case, Brigadier.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15: Ext. LANYON MOOR\nDOCTOR: On this part of the moor we can hear the distant crashing of waves at the bottom of the cliffs. Muddy footsteps. We hear the clunking of a well- equipped rucksack approaching EVELYN.\nEVELYN: Hello!\nNIKKI: Hello there! You going westward?\nEVELYN: I'm going this way, if that’s westward. Pengriffen.\nNIKKI: That’s where I’m headed too. I'm Nikki. Nice to meet you. Their footsteps continue throughout the scene.\nBVELYN: Evelyn. You’ve obviously come equipped.\nNIKKI: Yes! ’m doing the whole of the South-West coastal path.\nEVELYN: I say. How far is that?\nNIKKI: Well, you start up near Minehead and it goes all the way round to Dorset. It’s over 600 miles altogether.\nEVELYN: You must be mad!\nNIKKI: I love it. It’s my year out before college, so I thought if I don't do it now, I won’t get another chance for a few years.\nNIKKI: EVELYN And you’re just doing it on your own?\nNIKKI: Not completely, no. I’m meeting up with friends for the odd stretch, but I’m the only one mad enough to do the whole lot.\nEVELYN: Are you camping?\nNIKKI: No, staying at Youth Hostels and B & B's — it’s the only\nNIKKI: way to get a decent bath. There’s a Hostel in Pengriffen, so that’s my target for tonight. What about you?\nEVELYN: I’m staying at the Archaeological Institute.\nNIKKI: Really?\nNIKKI: Voices fade as they walk on.\nNIKKI: SCENE 14: Int. INSIDE THE FOGOU\nDOCTOR: Just hold this for a moment, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: What the dickens is it?\nDOCTOR: Schlangian power-cell.\nBRIGADIER: Ask a silly question.\nBRIGADIER: The DOCTOR is turning out his pockets.\nDOCTOR: Ideally what I need is some copper wire... now where on Earth did that come from? Never mind. Ah, here we are! Power-cell, please.\nBRIGADIER: May I ask what you’re up to, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere in this fogou there's a point of electromagnetic conductivity. What mariners used to call a lodestone. BRIGADIER And you think that’s what’s been causing these electrical disturbances?\nDOCTOR: 109\nDOCTOR: Not causing them. Focusing them, if you like. Now, if I can find it, we might be a step nearer to understanding the nature of these manifestations. Hold this piece of wire. That’s it. No, higher up. Now, keep it steady while I wind it round this.”\nDOCTOR: SCENE 144A: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY) Background effects of SIR ARCHIBALD’s laboratory — see Scene 25. We hear computer keys being typed at speed.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Power level stabilised. Preliminary tests complete. Switch on.\nSIR: SCENE 15: Ext. LANYON MOOR EVELYN’s and NIKKI's footsteps, and the clunking of the rucksack, stop abruptly.\nEVELYN: Did you hear something?\nNIKKI: Where?\nEVELYN: Just up ahead — listen!\nEVELYN: Distantly, but clearly, we hear through the silent mist the baleful, hideous giggle of an imp or goblin.\nNIKKI: What was that?\nEVELYN: I don’t know, but I don’t like the sound of it very much.\nNIKKI: Oh, come on, let’s get going. It’s just this fog making us imagine things. Nothing's going to get between me and my Horlicks.\nNIKKI: She shoulders her rucksack noisily.\nEVELYN: No, wait — don't —\nEVELYN: The chuckle again, nearer this time.\nEVELYN: It’s getting nearer.\nNIKKI: (Nervously) Oh, it’s just a bird or something.\nEVELYN: Nikki, I think we should go back the way we came.\nNIKKI: I think you could be right.\nEVELYN: Just turn round slowly, and — uh!\nEVELYN: A loud chuckle from the hideous imp which now confronts them.\nNIKKI: Run?\nEVELYN: Run!\nEVELYN: A flurry of movement as they start running. Muddy footsteps and frantic clanking of the rucksack. Then a piercing scream from NIKKI as the creature launches itself at her and brings her down with a thud. Another seream, which ends abruptly.\nEVELYN: Nikki! Nikki!\nEVELYN: END OF PART ONE\nEVELYN: 110"

How can a common or garden stone, in an Iron Age wall, turn out to be an electro-magnetic conductor, or whatever it is?\nDOCTOR: Take another look at it, Brigadier. That’s no common or garden stone.\nBRIGADIER: Looks the same as all the others to me.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR At first sight, perhaps, but that’s just the weathering. Now, if we lift away the veil of the centuries...\nBRIGADIER: How are you going to manage that?\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR With a teaspoon. Here, hold the torch. We hear metal scraping on stone.\nDOCTOR: There we are, you see. A bit of algae and soot and\nDOCTOR: calcification, but underneath it’s as fresh as a daisy.\nBRIGADIER: Bless my soul. It’s metal!\nDOCTOR: Not strictly speaking. It’s a mineral compound - a rock like any other. But it certainly doesn't belong in this parish.\nBRIGADIER: ‘The colours... I’ve never seen anything like it.\nDOCTOR: That’s hardly surprising. It was probably quarried on the planet Sperris.\nBRIGADIER: _['ll take your word for it, Doctor.

BEDROOM AT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nLUDGATE: We need to know that it’s now the following morning, so let’s hear birdsong through the window and the belis of the village church in the distance. EVELYN is sitting up in bed drinking tea. The mood is sombre.\nDOCTOR: Evelyn, I’m so sorry. I'd have done anything to prevent this from happening.\nEVELYN: I just can’t help thinking about that poor girl. Her whole\nEVELYN: life ahead of her...\nBRIGADIER: Try not to dwell on that, Dr Smythe. You've had a nasty shock yourself, and you must concentrate on making a full recovery.\nEVEL: Thank you, Brigadier. I'm made of quite stern stuff really.\nEVEL: (Pulling herself together) Doctor, it was some sort of creature. An imp or a@ goblin, even.\nDOCTOR: Remarkable. A physical manifestation of psionic energy.\nEVELYN: Oh, it was real enough.\nDOCTOR: I don’t doubt that. A fully-fledged manifestation would\nDOCTOR: have the power to influence the material plane on any level it wanted. SE pease Which it certainly did. You should have seen what was left of —\nBRIGADIER: Thank you, that will do, Mr Ludgate.\nBRIGADIER: pueeat™ Pm sorry.

(We hear LUDGATE go downstairs)\nEVELYN: What's being done about — making her decent?\nBRIGADIER: I've been on the line to UNIT. An undercover team is\nBRIGADIER: 112\nBRIGADIER: supervising things even now. We need to keep this whole business under wraps for the time being, Dr Smythe, but don’t worry. The deceased will be given every respect, and her relatives are being contacted straight away.\nEVELYN: Thank you, Brigadier.\nDOCTOR: Evelyn, do you feel up to telling me about this creature you saw?\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, I really think we should let —\nEVELYN: Brigadier, it’s fine, really. I'm feeling much better now.\nEVELYN: And anyway, I shall feel a great deal worse if we sit around and let something like this happen again.\nDOCTOR: That’s the spirit. Now, tell me exactly what you saw.\nEVELYN: It was getting dark, Doctor, and it was very foggy, so I’m afraid it wasn’t exactly ideal conditions. But the first thing we heard was a sort of... chuckling sound. There was something horribly malevolent about it. Then there were the lights, little dots in the mist like fireflies. And then... then it was just there on the path in front of us. It was hideous, Doctor. Like something out of Grimm’s fairytales. It couldn’t have been more than about three feet tall, but you could see it was incredibly strong and... sinewy, I suppose is the word. And it was grinning at us. ’'m afraid I don’t remember anything too clearly after that.\nDOCTOR: Well done, Evelyn. Fascinating. A complete psionic projection of the creature itself.\nEVELYN: But why didn’t it attack me?\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely certain. You say it just disappeared? EVELYN The thing launched itself right at me. I thought I'd had it,\nDOCTOR: but then, quick as a flash, it just melted away in mid-air.\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what’s the explanation?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. It sounds as though Evelyn must have repulsed the psionic field somehow.\nEVELYN: Thank you very much.\nDOCTOR: But to do that, you’d need to be surrounded by a - wait a minute! Were you carrying that little stone you found in the fogou?\nEVELYN: Um -— yes, I think I put it in my handbag.\nDOCTOR: May I?\nEVELYN: Go ahead.\nEVELYN: We hear the DOCTOR unzipping and rummaging through EVELYN'’s bag over the following dialogue.\nBRIGADIER: Do I gather Dr Smythe was protected from this creature by another piece of alien rock, Doctor?”\nDOCTOR: It’s possible. Honestly, Evelyn, how do you ever find anything in this mess?\nEVELYN: Well, if that isn’t the pot calling the kettle black, I don’t know what is.\nDOCTOR: Ah, here we are.\nBRIGADIER: Curious-looking thing.\nDOCTOR: It's a bisilicate compound of some kind. I wonder — some sort of magnetic induction loop, perhaps.\nEVELYN: It’s just a pebble with a hole in it!\nDOCTOR: Yes it is, isn’t it? We’re dealing with an entirely alien\nDOCTOR: technology here. Still, the fact that you were carrying this explains how you managed to dissipate the psionic field when the projection got too close to you.\nDOCTOR: 113,\nBRIGADIER: What course of action do you propose now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s time we got to know our enemy a little better. Evelyn, did you find anything in Sir Archibald’s library?\nEVELYN: Rather a lot, as a matter of fact.\nEVELYN: Door opens.\nLUDGATE: Hot chocolate, as requested.\nEVELYN: Bless you, Mr Ludgate. And would you just pass over my\nEVELYN: bag? Thank you. Now then...\nEVELYN: She rustles papers.\nEVELYN: There's quite a history of things going bump in the night around here. I knew I’d heard of Lanyon Moor somewhere along the line, and yesterday afterncon I suddenly realised where, so I phoned up a friend of mine who lectures in history at Oxford. Now listen to this. It comes from the diary of a fellow called Edward Hopkins, who fought with the Royalists in the Civil War. In 1648 he was on the run from a party of Roundheads, and he hid in the fogou overnight. There — read that.\nEVELYN: We hear papers change hands. Atmospheric music as the DOCTOR reads.\nDOCTOR: (Reads) ‘Mortal dread was my only companion, for that place the Fogie Hole has long been call’d a Home of Witches and Devils. The night was pass’d in watchful prayer, and in the morning I gave thanks to leave that ungodly Pit with my life. I reach’d the place known as Pengriffen's Knap, whereat I made a strange and wonderful discovery that brought me in mind of how near I had come to my doom. The persecutors of the King’s army had made their camp beside that ancient hillock, and around the embers of their campfire I found their pitiful remains. Torn asunder they were to the last man, whether by the onslaught of some fearful beast, or by Divine retribution against their wickedness, I cannot tell.’\nDOCTOR: Underscoring stops.\nDOCTOR: Well, he had a Cavalier attitude.\nEVELYN: Don’t joke. It’s horrible.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is. What else did you find?\nEVELYN: Right. There’s one of Sir Archibald’s ancestors, a fellow\nEVELYN: called Sir Percival Flint, who controlled the tin-mining industry around these parts at the end of the eighteenth century. Anyway, it seems that Percy was a bit of an amateur archaeologist.\nLUDGATE: They all were in those days. Amateur, I mean. Did more damage than good, digging everything up willy-nilly and not putting it back properly.\nDOCTOR: Please don’t interrupt, Mr Ludgate. I can’t abide interruptions.\nDOCTOR: As if on cue, the door opens.\nMORGAN: Ah, there you are, Dr Smythe. So sorry to hear about your awful experience.\nEVELYN: Tm much better now, thank you, Professor.\nDOCTOR: What happened to Sir Percival, Evelyn?\nEVELYN: Where was I? Ah yes. In 1783 he tried to excavate one of\nEVELYN: the chambered tombs, and according to him, all hell broke loose. Listen to this. ‘No sooner had the great portal-stone been dragged from its place, than a fearful wind blew up, which together with ghastly shrieks and Screams, such as might have arisen from the unholiest depths, caused the men to desert their work and flee...’\nEVELYN: 114\nDOCTOR: Fascinating.\nMORGAN: Oh, really, Doctor, that sort of thing is all very well for a busload of hippies at Tintagel, but I’d expect a little more rigour from an academic like yourself.\nBRIGADIER: 0h, I think you'll find that the Doctor can be quite rigorous when the occasion demands, Professor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Brigadier. Go on, Evelyn.\nEVELYN: Well, it carries on in the same vein for a bit, blah-blah- blah... ah, here we are: ‘When at length the men were prevailed upon to return the stone to its former position, it was found that whereas six horses had been necessary to remove it from the mound, only two were required to bring it back, and this despite the latter operation taking an uphill gradient.’\nMORGAN: Oh, the early antiquarians are full of that sort of nonsense. Fancy and flummery, whipped up to get a bit of publicity.”’\nEVELYN: Well, I don't know how you explain the next bit.\nDOCTOR: Tell on.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN In the 1840s there was a tenant farmer who decided to\nDOCTOR: flatten the tumulus so he could plough up the hill and plant more crops. He’d hardly started digging when he had a heart attack and dropped down dead right there on top of the mound.\nLUDGATE: Yes, that one’s a well-known story round here. They reckon his entire herd of cattle died within the next month, and when the new farmer moved in, his crops failed for seven years.\nMORGAN: Oh, for pity’s sake, Mr Ludgate, don’t you start.\nDOCTOR: Remarkable. An enormous release of psionic energy triggered by interference with the mound, I imagine. Enough to annihilate life and pcison the soil in the immediate area. A formidable defence mechanism.\nDOCTOR: MORGAN A formidable release of preposterous flim-flam, you mean. Enough to drive any self-respecting academic to distraction.\nDOCTOR: Professor Morgan, have you ever heard the expression ‘only the used key shines’?\nMORGAN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Wherever I go in the universe I invariably meet people\nDOCTOR: like you. Intelligent, knowledgeable people who, for reasons I can only guess at, reach a point in their lives when they arbitrarily decide to close their minds to anything new. You make it a point of personal pride to scoff, mock and ridicule anybody who happens to inhabit a larger universe than the one in which you have chosen to imprison yourself. Well, that’s your business. You may believe I’m talking nonsense, and ITean't help what you personally choose to believe, but I do know this: the only way to learn is to keep your mind open to the input of those who are more knowledgeable than yourself. Now, I suggest we all go downstairs and let Evelyn get some rest.\nMORGAN: Well, of all the overbearing, condescending...\nBRIGADIER: What's your plan, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We need to trace the source of the energy emissions. Now,\nDOCTOR: I'm going back to the moor to fetch some equipment from the TARDIS. And while I'm away, nobody is to go anywhere near that fogou. Is that understood?\nMORGAN: I shall go where I please, when I please. I must tell you\nMORGAN: 115\nMORGAN: that I am not accustomed to being addressed in that manner, and furthermore...\nBRIGADIER: Ferfectly understood, Doctor. Come along, Professor, Mr Ludgate, let’s leave Dr Smythe in peace.”\nBRIGADIER: He bundles them out, MORGAN protesting, ‘Brigadier, this is unacceptable...’ Door closes.\nDOCTOR: Try and get some sleep, Evelyn.\nEVELYN: Doctor, I’m fine, really.\nEVELYN: pocTOR I know you are. But I have a feeling we'll need all the energy we can muster over the next day or so.\nEVELYN: All right. Pll try.\nDOCTOR: That’s the spirit.\nEVELYN: If I do that, will you go downstairs and apologise to Professor Morgan?\nDOCTOR: What on Earth for? The man’s an idiot.\nEVELYN: No he isn’t — he’s a very clever man at the top of his\nEVELYN: profession, who just doesn’t understand what’s going on. I'm not saying I don’t agree with every word of what you said, because I do. But try and look at things from his point of view. Here he is, trying to run a nice straightforward survey, and all of a sudden he’s got Doctors and Brigadiers and pixies and goodness knows what cluttering the place up. And now this poor girl getting killed. Under the circumstances you can’t blame him for taking it out on us. It’s a wonder the man hasn't gone completely doolally. Just try and be nice to him.\nDOCTOR: Oh... I suppose you’re right. Very well, I'll apologise.\nEVELYN: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and by the way...\nEVELYN: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Good work at the library.\nEVELYN: My pleasure.\nDOCTOR: Sleep tight.\nDOCTOR: He closes the door gently. SCENE 19: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nMORGAN: Do I take it that Martial Law has now been declared?\nBRIGADIER: Professor Morgan, there’s really no need to over-react. The Doctor has a brilliant mind, and many years of experience have taught me that it’s best to listen to him.\nMORGAN: T’ve never been spoken to in that tone of voice!\nBRIGADIER: I agree the Doctor can occasionally be a little forthright.\nMORGAN: He was arrogant!\nBRIGADIER: Single-minded, perhaps, maybe even a little vain — but arrogant? I don’t think so. Arrogance is a kind of foolishness, and believe me, the Doctor is no fool.”*\nDOCTOR: (Coming downstairs) I’m delighted to hear you say so, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor. How is Evelyn?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she’s as tough as old boots, she’ll be fine. Professor Morgan...\nMORGAN: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s a privilege and a pleasure to know that we can rely\nDOCTOR: 116\nDOCTOR: on your expertise during this crisis. Your presence is quite invaluable and we're tremendously fortunate to have you here.\nMORGAN: Humph.\nDOCTOR: When I get back here with my equipment, I’d be most stateful for your advice on matters archaeological.\nMORGAN: Well, we shall see.\nDOCTOR: Good, good. I should be back within the hour. (He is\nDOCTOR: departing) And remember — no-go fogou!\nBRIGADIER: Understood, Doctor.\nBRIGADIER: Door.\nMORGAN: (Sulking but no longer angry) What an infuriating man.\nBRIGADIER: 0h, he can be. He can be.\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 20: Ext. PATH OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTE The DOCTOR closes the door and we hear his footsteps crunching on the gravel path.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) What an infuriating man. However - onward and upward. Portable field vector map should do the trick. Ill be fun carrying that down the hill...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: Int. BEDROOM AT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Knock on door.\nEVELYN: Come in.\nEVELYN: Door opens.\nLUDGATE: I’ve brought you another hot chocolate.\nEVELYN: You're a Man after my own heart, Mr Ludgate.\nLUDGATE: Oh, don't keep calling me that. Philip, please.\nEVELYN: Well, thank you. One of my students is called Philip.\nEVELYN: I suppose you’re not much older than him, come to think of it, are you?\nLUDGATE: I don’t know how old he is, but I’m twenty-five if that helps.\nEVELYN: Listen, Philip, I think there’s something not quite right up at the Manor.\nLUDGATE: How do you mean?\nEVELYN: Well... I don’t know. All his servants were away. Sir\nEVELYN: Archibald’s all alone in that great big house, and yet...\nLUDGATE: What?\nEVELYN: I don’t know - I just got the impression that there was more going on in that house than he wanted me to think. Just a sort of gut feeling I had.\nLUDGATE: Well, he’s a funny old boy, that’s for sure. He’s probably the original Norman Bates. Got his mother in the cellar.\nEVELYN: No, I’m serious. He left me alone in the library, and when\nEVELYN: I opened the door a second later he’d disappeared. There was no way he could have got right across the hall in that time.\nLUDGATE: Well, I should think that old house is full of hidden panels and things. Nothing terribly mysterious about that.\nEVELYN: But it was literally a matter of seconds. I think there’s something funny about him.\nLUDGATE: You mean you think he might have something to do with what’s been going on?\nLUDGATE: 117\nEVELYN: Oh, I don’t know. It seems ridiculous now you've said it. He's probably just a sweet old man. Very old-fashioned — something of which, as you might imagine, J approve.\nLUDGATE: You don't think we should —\nEVELYN: What?\nLUDGATE: Well - you know - go and have a little poke around? EVELYN At the Manor?\nLUDGATE: Yes. Sir Archibald goes out every single morning. He’s always down in the village, chairing committee meetings for the local hunt or whatever. We could take advantage of his absence.\nEVELYN: You mean break in?\nLUDGATE: Well - yeah.\nEVELYN: That’s an outrageous suggestion. (Pause) Shall we do it?\nLUDGATE: Seriously?\nEVELYN: No, we can’t. The Brigadier and Professor Morgan would\nEVELYN: never countenance it.\nLUDGATE: Well, they don’t have to know, do they? I mean, after what happened last night the survey's pretty much on hold, so I’m free to do what I want. And you’re up here getting some much-needed sleep, aren’t you? So who would notice if we just slipped down the back stairs and popped over to Pengriffen Manor for a couple of hours? Have a quick snoop around, be back here before lunch.”\nEVELYN: This is criminal.\nLUDGATE: Well, a bit.\nEVELYN: Let's do it.\nLUDGATE: Great. I'll nip down the back stairs and check if the coast is clear while you get dressed.\nEVELYN: Not a word of this to the others, all right? I’m sure the Brigadier is altogether far too chivalrous to let me out of this room until I'm fully recovered. Which I am, incidentally.\nLUDGATE: Mum’s the word. I'll see you in a minute.\nLUDGATE: SCENE 22: Ext, LANYON MOOR\nDOCTOR: (Singing to himself as he climbs; perhaps we can also hear the pinging of the TARDIS homing device as in Mawdryn Undead) Bom-bom-bom... I've wandered up and down this particular airy mountain quite enough times already... and here —- we - are! Wait a minute... the TARDIS... it’s gone!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR Echoing acoustic as before in the hallway. We hear a latch opening and\nDOCTOR: an external door being tentatively opened to avoid making noise. Speeches are half-whispered to begin with.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE In you come!\nEVELYN: I'm rather glad I was too large to get through the window. I'm afraid I make a rather nervous housebreaker.\nLUDGATE: (A bit louder) Could have been a lot harder. We should be thankful Sir Archibald doesn’t have burglar alarms.\nEVELYN: Sshh! Keep your voice down!\nLUDGATE: Oh, there’s no one about, honestly. Nobody here but us chickens. So, where d’you want to start?\nLUDGATE: 118\nEVELYN: I don’t even know what we’re doing here really. All right, you start on the rooms down that corridor. I'll go across the hall and start on the other wing.\nLUDGATE: Right. Er, what am I looking for, exactly?\nBVELYN: Anything that might suggest he’s got some sort of operation going on here. Incriminating letters, computer files, I don't know. Evidence of jiggery-pokery.\nLUDGATE: Right.\nEVELYN: Meet you at the main staircase in twenty minutes.\nLUDGATE: Righto.\nLUDGATE: SCENE 24: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Door.\nBRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor. Did you get the equipment you needed?\nDOCTOR: (Absently) Mm? No.\nBRIGADIER: Change of plan?\nDOCTOR: You could say that, yes. The TARDIS has disappeared.\nBRIGADIER: Taken off without you? How?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. She's either dematerialised or slipped a\nDOCTOR: dimension somehow, but either way she’s gone.\nBRIGADIER: Hold on, Doctor. I seem to recall the TARDIS became invisible once before.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s nothing like that, Brigadier. This is rather more serious, I’m afraid. This creature, whatever it is, doesn't want me to have access to the TARDIS. I suspect it’s already sensed that I might be a threat to its plans.\nBRIGADIER: Well, that's just it, Doctor - what is it, and what are its plans?\nDOCTOR: i wish I knew.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 25: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR We hear EVELYN's footsteps in an echoing room.\nEVELYN: (To herself) Nothing here either. Oh, this is ridiculous.\nEVELYN: Breaking and entering at my age. You should be ashamed of yourself,\nEVELYN: woman. I’m getting out of here.\nEVELYN: An ominous click as she inadvertently activates a hidden door, which\nEVELYN: creaks open.\nEVELYN: Hello — what on Earth is this?\nEVELYN: As she enters, we hear the faint hum of electronic equipment and the\nEVELYN: occasional bleep of some sort of scanning device — in other words, the\nEVELYN: This is incredible! What is it?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD It’s my laboratory, Dr Smythe. Do you Like it?\nSIR: A gasp of surprise from EVELYN as he clicks the door shut behind her.\nEVELYN: Sir Archibald! What are you doing in here?\nSTR: ARCHIBALD Isn’t that the very question I ought to be asking you, Dr\nSTR: Smythe?\nEVELYN: Er... yes, that is rather difficult to explain, isn’t it?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I feel confident that you'll give it a go.\nEVELYN: Well, you did say I could come back whenever I liked.\nEVELYN: 119\nSTR: ARCHIBALD Call me an old traditionalist, but I had rather naively imagined that you might have come to the front door and rung the bell. Well, 1 must say this is all terribly exciting. I’ve never had burglars before. Are you alone, or do you have accomplices casing the joint?\nEVELYN: I'm... alone.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You're quite sure about that, are you?\nEVELYN: You can see for yourself there’s nobody else here. I came on my own.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Well, that’s fortunate. But only for me, I’m afraid. You really shouldn’t have come here, Dr Smythe.\nEVELYN: I'd better be on my way then.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh no, I don’t think so. Not now. I’m afraid you've seen things you really oughtn’t to have seen. The question is, what am I going to do with you?\nSIR: SCENE 26: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nSIR: DOCTOR The question is, how can I trace the source of the energy emissions?\nBRIGADIER: Without your gubbins from the TARDIS, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Time to empty the pockets again, I think.\nBRIGADIER: That reminds me, I've still got your roll of copper wire in my coat pocket. Shall I get it?\nDOCTOR: Not much help just at the moment, Brigadier. Good gracious, a meta-dimensional rheostat. I wonder how long I’ve been carrying that around.\nBRIGADIER: Any good for the job in hand?\nDOCTOR: Completely useless, unfortunately. I suppose I could lash up a short-range scanner...\nBRIGADIER: = That'll do the trick, will it?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’ll be a bit of a botch-up. I'd have to cannibalise the tracking equipment in here...\nBRIGADIER: I'm sure that will endear you to Professor Morgan no end.\nDOCTOR: Well, you can't have everything, can you? There’s just one problem.\nBRIGADIER: There always is.\nDOCTOR: Clearly this creature has highly developed powers of\nDOCTOR: Psychic manipulation. The moment I switch on, it'll almost certainly\nDOCTOR: realise what I’m up to, and set up a field of psionic interference.\nBRIGADIER: You mean a kind of jamming signal?\nDOCTOR: Exactly, a jamming signal. The TARDIS’s telepathic\nDOCTOR: circuits would have circumvented that problem, but without them...\nBRIGADIER: Go on.\nDOCTOR: Well, the only way I can do it is by amplifying my own\nDOCTOR: alpha-waves and introducing them as a random factor in the scanning\nDOCTOR: operation.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, as I’m sure you are only too aware, I am hanging\nBRIGADIER: on to this conversation by my fingernails. Are you saying that this device\nBRIGADIER: will need your own mental powers to make it work?\nBRIGADIER: poerOn In effect, yes. But that makes it sound more complicated it is.\nBRIGADIER: Isn’t it going to be rather dangerous, Doctor? Going head- to-head with this psychic creature?\nBRIGADIER: 120\nDOCTOR: Potentially lethal, I should think.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER In that case I absolutely forbid it.\nDOCTOR: Brigadier, it’s the only way. We have to find out what this creature is doing. There may only have been one death so far, but believe Ihe, unless we get cracking it won't be the last by a long chalk.\nBRIGADIER: There must be another way...\nDOCTOR: If there were, I should certainly take it, but there isn’t! It’s a necessary risk, Brigadier. If my suspicions are correct, your planet is in the gravest danger.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 27: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY)\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Comfortable, Dr Smythe?\nEVELYN: Do I look comfortable?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You don’t, but as you’ve already discovered today, appearances can be deceptive.\nBVEL: Will you please untie me? I'll be missed, you know.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD That doesn’t really matter. By the time people come looking, I'll be... in charge.\nEVELYN: You're a bit crackers, aren’t you?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Am I? It’s all so subjective, isn’t it? Who says I'm crackers?\nEVELYN: I do. And everyone I can think of, offhand, would agree if they were here now.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD But they’re not, are they? Intellect, ambition, innovation, bravery, the courage to move beyond the stifling parameters of social conformity - these have always been regarded as signs of madness by the plodding majority.\nEVELYN: You're starting to sound like Dr Faustus now. Do you know what happened to him?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD My dear Dr Smythe, religion is for people who believe in Hell. Magic is for people who have been there.\nEVELYN: Magic? What are you ranting about now? You really are crackers, aren't you?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Have you ever heard of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn?\nEVELYN: Yes, I think so. Something to do with that narcissistic charlatan who wrote awful poetry - Crowley, Aleister Crowley. Filed his teeth into points and called himself ‘The Beast’. He was a bit of a joke really.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD He was a prophet, Dr Smythe. His vision was the dissolution of universal morality.\nEVELYN: Rubbish. He wasn’t a prophet. At the very best he was a cut-price Nietzsche.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law’.\nEVELYN: Well, exactly. What kind of feeble philosophy is that? My students observe it every Friday night - it’s just an excuse for a good party, dressed up in a bit of Medieval lingo.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You babbling inadequate. As you are about to learn, I have made rather more of it than that.\nEVELYN: I'm sure you have, but as I pointed out earlier, you’re erackers.\nEVELYN: 121\nSYR: ARCHIBALD There is power out there on Lanyon Moor. Deep, dark, primal power such as no man has ever known. All my life I have studied the history of this place, the psychic emanations, the spectre of the moor.\nEVELYN: That’s why you funded the survey.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I thought it might be of some use to me. But as it turns out, Professor Morgan’s scratching in the sand is of no consequence. With or without his assistance, my life’s work is about to reach fruition.\nEVELYN: It’s certainly got something to do with fruit, but probably not in the way you think. Nuts are another major ingredient.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Your clumsy attempts at sarcasm cannot disguise your fear, Dr Smythe. My family has always prided itself in being among this country’s most loyal servants. It is fashionable nowadays for those with no sense of duty or history to despise the so-called privileged classes. Our institutions are becoming overrun by the worst kind of parvenu. Well, my service may no longer be required, but my blood cannot be taken from me so easily.\nEVELYN: Don't let’s get above ourselves, old chum. You’re only a Baronet, you know. That makes you a commoner like me. You might think I have no sense of history, but I’m sufficiently up on the subject to know that your ancestors probably bought you your place on the lowest rung of the aristocracy.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Your envy ill becomes you, doctor.\nEVELYN: Anyway, what’s all this got to do with Aleister Crowley? How does the dissolution of morality fit in with some two-bit lordling with a screw loose, getting ideas above his station?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Crowley, of all men, knew that his flock needed leadership. And a prophet, after all, is merely one who prepares the way for a messiah.\nEVELYN: Oh I see, 4 messiah. And that would be you, would it?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Have a care, Dr Smythe. I am on the threshold of fulfilling my destiny.\nEVELYN: Well, that’s nice for you.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You mock me, but I smell the terror in your mind. What you see around you are the results of decades of privately funded research. The equipment in this laboratory focuses the power of my will. I believe you witnessed a demonstration only last night.\nSIR: EVELYN A demonstration...? You don’t mean... it was you who caused that creature to appear?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I summoned it forth, Dr Smythe, and it came.\nEVELYN: I don’t believe you.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Believe what you like. My experiments are complete. When the spectre rises tonight on Lanyon Moor, it is I who will harness it. Then I shall be able to create and destroy at will. To do my will shall be the whole of the law.\nEVELYN: (Getting a bit scared now) You really are mad, aren’t you? You actually believe all this rubbish!\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Doubt is Devil-born, Dr Smythe. Look at that window. Now! The window shatters into pieces spectacularly. Howling wind blows in.\nEVELYN: (Raising her voice above the wind) How did you do that?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD (Raising his voice similarly) 1 hope your students are more attentive than you are. I did it with my mind, Dr Smythe. Shall we Put tt back together again? Now!\nSIR: 122\nSIR: Reversed sound effect as the window re-forms. The wind stops abruptly and all is calm, including SIR ARCHIBALD.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Sixteenth-century. Wouldn’t want it broken, would we?\nEVELYN: You did that...\nSIR: ARCHIBALD It's a pity you didn’t believe me in the first place, Dr Smythe. When forced to provide a demonstration, one does feel rather like a performing seal.\nEVELYN: What are you going to do with me?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD If you hadn’t already seen too much, you certainly have now. my dear. And it occurs to me that I've never had a human subject before.\nEVELYN: What do you mean - a human subject?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD When I was a little boy, before the war, I remember my best friend and I used to enjoy burning ants with a magnifying glass.\nEVELYN: That doesn’t surprise me in the slightest.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD He died in Korea. But I'm straying away from the point.\nEVELYN: What is the point?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Now who's being a cut-price Nietzsche? The point, Dr Smythe, is that although I am still beset by ants, I don’t need a magnifying glass any more.\nSIR: You're totally unhinged. SIR A ARCHIBALD This laboratory is my glass, and with the merest twitch of my mind I can make things crackle and smoulder. Now, since it was your eyes that got you into this pickle, I think it’s only fitting that they should be the first part of you to be put out of their misery. I shall exercise the utmost discipline and boil them out very slowly, Dr Smythe. I want you to feel the benefit. Do excuse me for a moment, while I make the necessary adjustments to my apparatus. (He strides away)\nEVELYN: (Whispering to herself) Oh, Doctor...\nEVELYN: SCENE 28: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nDOCTOR: There. That should do it.\nBRIGADIER: Looks like the crystal wireless sets I used to make when I was a boy. Is this thing really going to work, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Should do. Now, Brigadier, I have to confess I’m not entirely sure exactly what will happen when I switch on. I might look as though I’m in some pain — come to think of it, 1 might be in some pain — but at all costs, don’t switch off, and don’t pull the headset off me. It might take some time to get a proper triangulation.\nBRIGADIER: Very well, Doctor. But are you quite sure this is entirely sensible?\nDOCTOR: I think, on reflection, this has to be one of the least sensible things I’ve ever done. But I have no choice, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Surely, if it’s just a matter of tracing some transmissions, we could do it at a UNIT tracking station.\nDOCTOR: You're forgetting the psionic jamming signal, Brigadier. Unlikely as it may seem, this little lash-up is our best option. And anyway, time is of the essence.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 29: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY) Computer keys being tapped.\nDOCTOR: 123\nSIR: ARCHIBALD [I won’t detain you for very much longer, doctor.\nEVELYN: You'll never get away with this, you know. People will stop ‘ou.\nEVELYN: 3mm ARCHIBALD [ don’t think so, Dr Smythe. You see, they simply won't\nEVELYN: have the willpower.\nEVELYN: Why on earth do you want to do it, anyway? Why impose\nEVELYN: your will on the whole world? What for?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD It is my destiny. My birthright.\nEVELYN: I can see why they wanted to get rid of the hereditary\nEVELYN: peers.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD You're an educated woman, Dr Smythe. Do you really\nSTR: want to end your life chattering like an ape?\nEVELYN: I wasn't planning to end it at all, actually.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD There - everything is ready. And we switch on — here —\nSIR: A switch is flicked and a new hum is added to the background.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh, this will be most interesting. Eyes first, didn’t we\nSIR: agree? Very well, Dr Smythe. Are you sitting comfortably? Then we’ll\nSIR: begin!\nSIR: The hum of power rises.\nSIR: END OF PART TWO\nSIR: 124"

You see, they simply won’t have the willpower.\nEVELYN: Why on earth do you want to do it, anyway? Why impose your will on the whole world? What for?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD It is my destiny. My birthright.\nEVELYN: I can see why they wanted to get rid of the hereditary peers.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You're an educated woman, Dr Smythe. Do you really want to end your life chattering like an ape?\nEVELYN: I wasn’t planning to end it at all, actually.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD There - everything is ready. And we switch on — here — A switch is flicked and a new hum is added to the background.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh, this will be most interesting. Eyes first, didn’t we agree? Very well, Dr Smythe. Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin!\nSIR: The hum of power rises.\nSIR: SCENE 50: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nDOCTOR: Well — no time like the present. Switch on, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: = Right. Hold tight, Doctor!\nBRIGADIER: The machine is switched on. Instantly all hell breaks loose — windows smashing, objects flying, a rushing wind and other ‘poltergeist’ activity. Through it all we hear the DOCTOR ery out in pain.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor! Doctor, are you all right?\nBRIGADIER: The barrage of noise continues, and cutting through it we hear the guttural how! of SANCREDA — all the rage and pain of his thousands of years of imprisonment.\nSANCREDA: Scryfan! Scryfan, you have deserted me! Do not leave me!\nSANCREDA: SCENE 31: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY) The background hum is rising in pitch.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Can you feel anything yet, Dr Smythe? Getting a little warm around the sockets, are we?\nEVELYN: moans softly. Then we hear the scanning equipment rising rapidly in pitch and a distant, muted version of the same cry from\nSANCREDA: as heard in the previous scene, as though from an immense distance.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD What is this? Circuit overload? How can it —\nSIR: A small explosion as parts of the equipment overload and blow up. The humming wavers downwards in pitch and stops. Silence.\nEVELYN: My eyes are fine.\nEVELYN: 125\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Shut up! (He slaps her; she gasps) Whatever has happened, my dear, I can assure you that your stay of execution is entirely temporary.\nSIR: SCENE 32: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE The deafening sound is still continuing as in Scene 30.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor! Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor! I’m going to switch off!\nBRIGADIER: The machine is deactivated. The roaring subsides, the wind drops and there is silence.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor? (Slaps face) Doctor, wake up. Doctor, can you hear me?”\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 33: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (STUDY) We hear old-fashioned, chunky bolts being drawn back. EVELYN is pushed into a cold and inhospitable room.\nEVELYN: I don’t think much of the guest wing.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Yes, I’m afraid my grandfather's study has been rather neglected in recent years, Dr Smythe, but since you have already proved yourself more than equal to the challenge of a little dust, I feel sure you will not find your stay here too incommodious.\nEVELYN: Oh no, it’s quite delightful. More stained glass, I see.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Indeed. In fact, you may wish to contemplate the subject of this window.\nEVELYN: It’s the ‘Noli Me Tangere’.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Curiously appropriate, is it not? He tells her not to touch Him because He has not yet ascended to His throne. But He will do so by and by, Dr Smythe.\nEVELYN: As soon as he’s repaired his computer banks, eh? I don’t remember that bit.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD Ferhaps it would be unwise to strain the analogy. But don’t worry, your stay here will not be protracted. I shall invite you back to my laboratory just as soon as repairs are complete.\nEVELYN: Do all your own maintenance as well, do you? I’m impressed.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD It would comfort you to think of me as a solitary madman, wouldn’t it, Dr Smythe? Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I am not alone here.\nEVELYN: I thought your butler was visiting his mother.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh, he is. I've had to get some other help in. Well, I'd love to stay chatting, as you can imagine, but I really must leave you for now, We shall resume our experiment later.\nSIR: Heavy door slams and bolts rattle.\nEVELYN: (A deep breath) Steady yourself, Evelyn. You’re all right. You’re in one piece and you've been in worse scrapes than this. Right\nEVELYN: then, I’ve seen this film. What happens now is that the heroine escapes from her cell. Somehow...\nEVELYN: SCENE 34: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nEVELYN: 126\nBRIGADIER: Doctor! Doctor, wake up!\nBRIGADIER: We hear the door being pushed open against piles of debris, and footsteps on broken glass.\nMORGAN: (Stunned by the devastation) What the devil’s been going on here?\nBRIGADIER: Frofessor Morgan, we're going to have to call an ambulance. The Doctor's out for the count.\nMORGAN: Um... right. Yes, of course. If I can find the telephone in all this - ah, here we are. (Begins dialling)\nBRIGADIER: Good man. I’ve got him warm and loosened his collar. I’m not sure what else I can do.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR A cup of tea would be nice.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, thank heavens! Never mind the ambulance, Professor Morgan. Could you lay on some tea instead?\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 38: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (STUDY) We hear EVELYN tapping and scraping the wood-panelled wall.\nEVELYN: Well, that’s the walls then. I suppose a secret passage would have been too much to expect. Real life just isn't that convenient. Doocr’s out of the question, so that just leaves the window. I wonder - if I wind my cardigan round something... like one of these books, for example...\nEVELYN: We hear a heavy book being taken from 2 shelf.\nEVELYN: Well, it’s worth a try, I suppose.\nEVELYN: SCENE 36: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE There is the occasional crunch of broken glass underfoot when people move during this scene.\nDOCTOR: (Taking a sip of tea) Delicious.\nMORGAN: Well, I'm glad you're feeling better, Doctor, but what Sir Archibald is going to say about this devastation I cannot imagine.*' To say nothing of the fact that months of careful research have been mashed up like soup in a blender. I only hope you've got something to show for it.\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nBRIGADIER: Was it worth risking your life and near: enough destroying Professor Morgan's lab? Have you got your readings?”\nDOCTOR: Two — three - six... just working them out now, Brigadier. T'll tell you what would be of the utmost assistance at this moment.\nBRIGADIER: Yes?\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR A pencil. Have you got one over there, Professor?\nMORGAN: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: Thank you so much. As my old tutor was fond of telling\nDOCTOR: Ine, you can go a long way with no talent, but you'll never get anywhere without a pencil. Did I say two-three-six?\nBRIGADIER: I think so, yes.\nDOCTOR: Good. A few seconds of frantic pencil scribbli:\nDOCTOR: There we are then. Very interesting. And pretty accurate,\nDOCTOR: I fancy, considering you did what I expressly told you not to do, Brigadier.\nDOCTOR: 127\nBRIGADIER: [If I hadn’t switched off when I did, Doctor, I doubt this building would still be in one piece.\nDOCTOR: Mm, you could be right. It was certainly a more dramatic reaction than I'd anticipated.\nMORGAN: You mean all this wind and poltergeist stuff was simply this creature trying to stop what you were doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid so. And if he can do that in his sleep, imagine what it'll be like when he wakes up.\nMORGAN: I don’t follow you.\nDOCTOR: As I expected, the epicentre of the primary psionic field\nDOCTOR: is that tumulus on the hill. The creature that’s lying dormant beneath it has been haunting the moor for centuries.\nMORGAN: Since Neolithic times, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Oh, long before that. My guess would be that it arrived on Earth anything up to twenty thousand years ago. When the Neolithic settlers arrived they probably plonked their graveyard up there because it seemed to them that the site had connections with the spirit world. BRIGADIER And this creature is roused from its sleep whenever the ground is disturbed?\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Brigadier. Hence the trouble with the archaeologists, and the Royal Navy and so forth.\nBRIGADIER: Well, what about the fogou? I mean, isn’t that supposed to have been built thousands of years later? Where does that fit in?\nDOCTOR: I should imagine it was built by the Iron Age farmers as some kind of refuge when the haunting was particularly strong. Unfortunately for them, they used materials that were lying around the hillside.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER And in the process they used that piece of moon-rock or whatever it was?\nDOCTOR: Seems likely. So rather than a shelter, they ended up with a custom-built haunted house.\nMORGAN: So you're saying that the imps that are supposed to haunt this place are some sort of psychic image of the creature itself?\nDOCTOR: That’s exactly right.\nMORGAN: But there’s supposed to be a whole army of them.\nDOCTOR: No reason why the creature can’t create a multiple\nDOCTOR: manifestation of itself. Mind you, an army of projections will be nothing compared with just one of the real thing.\nBRIGADIER: Any idea what kind of creature it is, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Judging by Evelyn's description, together with the psionic activity and the lodestone in the fogou, I think I have a theory, yes. And it’s not a very comforting one.\nBRIGADIER: Well, don’t keep us in suspense.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s a Tregannan. A race of planet-hopping colonists from the Spurgian system. Particularly vicious bunch, I'm afraid. Millions of years ago they found a way to regulate the electrical activity of their brains with the help of certain psycho-active minerals found in their part of the galaxy. As a result, their entire technology is based on psionic energy and bits of old rock. It makes a formidable combination.\nMORGAN: It’s the most fantastic thing I’ve ever heard.\nDOCTOR: But you’re prepared to believe it, Professor?\nDOCTOR: 128\nMORGAN: I’ve got to, haven’t 1, Doctor? After the events of the last couple of days, I think all bets are off.\nDOCTOR: Good man. Because I’m afraid things are going to get a great deal worse.\nBRIGADIER: What makes you say that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: My little lash-up detected something else. A secondary psionic field operating approximately 24 degrees East, 38 degrees North.\nMORGAN: But... that’s nowhere near here.\nBRIGADIER: No. That must be, oh, roughly, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR At a guess, Brigadier, I should think it’s Athens A beat.\nBRIGADIER: Athens? Great Scott! But that’s where —\nDOCTOR: Yes. A bit of a coincidence, wouldn't you say?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 37: Int. ATHENS MUSEUM Voices and bustle as crowds move through a busy museum. This atmosphere underscores the whole scene.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE The next hall, ladies and gentlemen, contains some of the finest examples of classical Greek marble to be found anywhere outside the British Museum in London. (Polite laugher) But no, to be serious, ladies and gentlemen, all the sculptures in this hall date from the 5th century BC and they represent the peak of this beautiful art-form.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Excuse me?\nMUSEUM: GUIDE (Aside to MRS MOYNIHAN) A moment, please. (To her party) Enjoy the sculptures, ladies and gentlemen, and I will join you in @ little minute. (To MRS MOYNIHAN) How can I help you, madam?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Could you direct me to the Celtic exhibits, please?\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Ah, madam, you have come at the wrong time. I am afraid that gallery is closed for renovation.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Ob, what an absolute nuisance. I was so hoping to see them.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE We don’t have so many items of interest in our Celtic gallery, madam. It is very small, I’m afraid.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I know, but it’s a particular hobby-horse of mine. I say, you couldn’t give me a little private view, could you? I’d be terribly quick.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE I’m sorry, madam, but it is not permitted.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I'm quite happy to pay. A personal payment, of course. Look, I have some cash here. Would 200,000 Drachma be a suitable figure?\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Madam cannot be serious! I think, maybe, you don't understand your rates of exchange.\nMRS: MCYNIHAN 0), really, have I got it mixed up? How about 300,000 then?\nMUSEUM: GUIDE You don’t mean it, madam.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I assure you II do. Really, just two minutes of your time would suffice.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Right now? I mean, this minute?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN If you please.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Okay. One moment, please. (To the crowd) Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy these sculptures and I shall return to you in just a few\nMUSEUM: 129\nMUSEUM: minutes. (To MRS MOYNIHAN) This way then please, madam. We must be quick, however.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN So kind!\nMRS: SCENE 38: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nMRS: DOCTOR The focusing amplifier. That’s what she'll be after.\nBRIGADIER: What's that? Part of this creature’s spaceship?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. It’s one of the cornerstones of Tregannan\nDOCTOR: technology. A cyber-surgical implant worn on the body that slots into whichever piece of equipment they're using at the time. It enables them to boost their psionic energy over immense distances, and power up their hardware. Anything from a microwave oven to an interstellar battlecruiser.\nMORGAN: Now I know what to put on my birthday list.\nBRIGADIER: Well, what the devil is this thing doing in Athens?\nDOCTOR: It’s had plenty of time to get there, Brigadier. Remember, the Celts traded with the Mediterranean civilisations. I should imagine it was taken from Cornwall as a curio some time in the first century BC. Two thousand years later it’s gathering dust in Athens. It’s probably in a museum somewhere.\nBRIGADIER: Well, why hasn’t anyone spotted it before now?\nDOCTOR: No reason why they should. I told you, Tregannan technology doesn't involve much industrial manufacture. This focusing amplifier will be nothing more than a small coil of ferrous metal, about the size of a coffee mug. It’l] probably be covered in rust. Doesn’t matter — it'll still work.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER And if Mrs Moynihan brings it back here — there’ll be trouble, I take it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. There'll be trouble all right.\nMORGAN: Hang on a minute, Doctor. Are you suggesting that Mrs Moynihan is in some way under this creature’s influence?\nDOCTOR: Well, I doubt he’s actually got her hypnotised.”\nDOCTOR: Tregannans have many powers, but that isn’t one of them.\nBRIGADIER: Then why’s she working for him?\nDOCTOR: Why does anyone work for anyone? I imagine she’s been promised something in return. Wealth, power, the usual.\nMORGAN: Are you telling me that my housekeeper has entered into some kind of Faustian pact with a pixie from outer space?\nDOCTOR: It's beginning to look that way, Professor.\nDOCTOR: MORGAN The minute she gets back here, she’s fired.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, if Mrs Moynihan gets back here you’ll have\nDOCTOR: precious little time to give her her cards. Brigadier, this is serious. That focusing amplifier must be kept away from the moor at all costs. Preferably kept out of the country altogether.\nBRIGADIER: = Right, you'd better come with me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Where to?\nBRIGADIER: = Goonhilly tracking station, about twenty miles away. They’ve got a UNIT operative in place there. We’ll need to get on to HQ and see about setting up some roadblocks. With any luck it won’t come to that, and we can intercept her at the airport.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. [' just pop upstairs and tell Evelyn what’s happening. I doubt she slept through our little experiment.\nDOCTOR: 130\nMORGAN: Um, I'll do that if you like, Doctor. I mean, if it’s that urgent, you'd better be on your way.\nDOCTOR: Yes, good idea. Thank you, Professor. Tell her we’ll be back as soon as we can, would you?\nMORGAN: Will do.\nBRIGADIER: Come along then, Doctor, we've got a brisk walk ahead of us. The car’s parked down at the pub.\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 39: Int. ATHENS MUSEUM\nBRIGADIER: A door opens on a still, quiet display hall, closed for renovation. While the door is open we can hear the distant bustle of the museum in the background. Door closes.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE This is where we keep our small Celtic collection, madam.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN 0b, splendid. Thank you so much. You may go.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Ah, 10, madam. I must stay while you are here, so I can then lock up afterwards.*’ And we have not very much time.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN No, indeed. I see. Very well. Then I'd better see if I can find what I’m looking for.\nSANCREDA: (A distant, muffled voice from afar; he’s speaking only in\nMRS: MOYNIHAN’s head) It is here. It is in this room. Search!\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Oh yes, these are fascinating, really they are.* Let’s see, what do we have here?\nSANCREDA: There! Before you now in the second cabinet! It is the focusing amplifier!\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Feally? That old thing at the back?\nMUSEUM: GUIDE I beg your pardon, madam?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN It doesn't look at all how I imagined.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE What doesn't?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Oh do shut up, you irritating little fool.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE I beg madam’s pardon?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN You know, it offends me deeply that I even have to speak to people like you. You only brought me here because I offered you money. Look at you, with your high heels and your make-up and your greedy little eyes. You disgust me.\nMUSEUM: GUIDE Madan, I must ask you to leave now so that I ean lock up.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN 0b, I’m leaving all right. But you're not. And since you obviously have a penchant for cheap glass jewellery, perhaps you can make use of this!\nMRS: A loud smashing of glass. Alarms go off. We hear MRS MOYNIHAN walking briskly out of the room, closing the door. The alarm fades as she Jocks the door behind her and walks off.\nMRS: SCENE 40: Int, ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nMRS: Door opens.\nLUDGATE: (Tired and breathless) Professor!\nMORGAN: Ludgatel Where the devil have you been?\nLUDGATB: I’ve been looking all over for Evelyn. You haven’t seen her, have you?\nMORGAN: I was going to ask you the same thing. We thought she\nMORGAN: 131\nMORGAN: was upstairs, but the bed’s not been slept in. Look, I’m just popping down the road to see if she’s left a message at the pub. The Doctor’s at Goonhilly with Lethbridge-Stewart. You hold the fort here, all right?\nLUDGATE: Right. :\nMORGAN: (Calling back) And the Doctor says not to go near the dig!\nMORGAN: SCENE 41: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (STUDY)\nEVELYN: Well, here goes with Smythe’s patent glass-silencer. Forgive me, Sir John Arundell, but it’s either me or your window. (She takes a deep breath. We hear a dull crack of glass breaking and the quieter tinkle of broken pieces landing on the ground outside. In the distance we can hear some rooks crowing in the trees) So far so good. Now for the tricky bit.\nEVELYN: SCENE 42: Int. GOONHILLY TRACKING STATION\nEVELYN: The background atmosphere of a busy NAGA-type communications control room — technicians muttering into headsets, telephones being answered, computer keyboards being typed.\nBRIGADIER: Goonhilly is one of the UN's telecommunication nerve- centres, Doctor. Once they get a UNIT incident team set up in here we should be able to get some results.\nDOCTOR: Well, how much longer is it going to take?”\nBRIGADIER: Matter of minutes now. I've just had confirmation that the team’s flown in to Culdrose\nDOCTOR: About time too. We were hanging around in reception for the best part of two hours.\nBRIGADIER: Yes, I'm sorry, Doctor, but you must appreciate I’ve been retired for a few years now. Gone are the days when all I had to do was reach for the red telephone. The desk it’s on is three hundred miles away and has someone else’s feet under it, so I’m afraid the security clearances take a little longer.”\nDOCTOR: Bumbling bureaucracy. I wouldn’t be surprised if Mrs Moynihan’s back in the country by now.\nDOCTOR: Footsteps approaching.\nASHFORDE: Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart?\nBRIGADIER: Yes, Captain.\nASHFORDE: Ashforde, sir, International Liaison.\nBRIGADIER: Pleased to meet you, Captain Ashforde. This is the Doctor.\nASHFORDE: How do you do, sir. It’s an honour to work with you both.\nBRIGADIER: ll right, Captain, we need to crack on with this business straight away.\nASHFORDE: So I understand, sir. We're already setting up a cordon around the immediate area. Roadblocks on all the major routes and we’re posting sentries on the approaches to the burial chamber.\nBRIGADIER: Any news from Athens?\nASHFORDE: Yes, sir, and I'm afraid it’s not good. (A rustle of paper) This report's just through. Pelagia Stamatis, part-time guide at the Athens Central Museum, was found unconscious with severe head injuries in a\nASHFORDE: locked gallery at 12.25, local time today. The police are treating it as aggravated burglary.\nASHFORDE: 132\nDOCTOR: Burglary?\nASHFORDE: One of the display cases was smashed to bits. The girl hasn’t come round yet, so they're not sure whether anything’s missing.\nDOCTOR: Oh, something’s missing, Captain, believe me.\nBRIGADIER: 18.85, Athens time. So that was 10.25 this morning. How long did it take them to find her?\nASHFORDE: Not very long, sir. The alarms went off as soon as the case was smashed, but there would have been time enough for the culprit to leave the museum.\nASHFORDE: BRIGADIER And that was, what, five hours ago. More than enough time for Mrs Moynihan to fly back home and clear customs. How long have you been watching the airports?\nASHFORDE: Flights into Gatwick and Heathrow have been under surveillance for the last half hour, sir. Nothing yet. We're setting up all the other major ones now - Stansted, East Midlands, Birmingham —\nBRIGADIER: What about the small local airports? Plymouth, Exeter, Bristol? Has anyone checked if they take flights from Athens?\nASHFORDE: I'm not sure, sir.\nBRIGADIER: Not sure? Dammit, man, those are the first ones you should have secured. This isn’t just a matter of picking up some harmless old granny as she goes through the green gate, you know. She'll be working to a plan.\nASHFORDE: Yes, sir.\nBRIGADIER: Well, don’t just stand there, Captain. Get onto it!\nASHFORDE: Sir! (He goes)\nDOCTOR: Well, Brigadier, it looks as if we might be too late after all.\nBRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor If we've missed her at the airport, the roadblocks will pick her up.\nDOCTOR: I hope you're right, Brigadier.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 43: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nLUDGATE: is on the telephone.\nLUDGATE: All right... I'll see you in two weeks, then. Give my love to Dad. Okay, bye. Phone down. Door opens.\nEVELYN: Oh, Philip, thank goodness.\nLUDGATE: Evelyn! Where in God's name did you get to? I’ve been worried sick!\nEVELYN: Where’s the Doctor?\nLUDGATE: He’s not here. Professor Morgan says he’s gone to\nLUDGATE: Goonhilly with the Brigadier. Hey, what’s the matter with you? You've got blood on your arm.\nEVELYN: It’s only a scratch. I got it climbing out of the window.\nLUDGATE: What happened back there? Where did you disappear to?\nEVELYN: Sir Archibald caught me.\nLUDGATE: Oh dear. Give you a Dit of a telling-off, did he?\nEVELYN: Philip, we’ve got to do something. The man is completely insane.\nLUDGATE: Oh, come on. I know he’s a bit eccentric, but surely that’s\nLUDGATE: pushing it a bit.\nEVELYN: You think so? I only escaped by breaking a window and making a run for it.\nEVELYN: 133\nLUDGATE: What? You make it sound as if he’s been keeping you risoner.\nEVELYN: That’s exactly what he was doing. Philip, he’s completely\nEVELYN: off his rocker. He’s some sort of latter-day warlock. He’s got a secret\nEVELYN: laboratory up there and he’s planning to take control of this creature’s\nEVELYN: psychic power.\nLUDGATE: I do believe you’re serious.\nEVELYN: Tm serious all right. Since I last saw you I’ve been tied\nEVELYN: up, locked up, threatened with torture — I’d probably be dead by now if\nEVELYN: his machinery hadn’t gone phut.\nLUDGATE: T can hardly believe it. Well, what should we do?\nEVELYN: How long did the Doctor say he’d be?\nLUDGATE: I don’t know, I wasn’t here.\nEVELYN: Well, whatever it is Sir Archibald’s intending to do, I very\nEVELYN: much got the impression that tonight’s the night. 1 think we should go back to the Manor.\nLUDGATE: Are you mad? If what you've just told me is true -\nEVELYN: It is true.\nLUDGATE: Then we should keep well away from there.\nEVELYN: But he's got to be stopped. I’m sure that’s what the Doctor would say if he were here. If we can take him by surprise — I don’t know, sabotage his laboratory or something...\nLUDGATE: You really are too headstrong for your own good, aren’t you? You're the kind of girl my mother warned me about.\nEVELYN: Since I’m old enough to be your mother, I'll take that as a compliment. Well, are you coming?“\nLUDGATE: I must be mad. Come on then. But let’s tread carefully.\nEVELYN: Don’t worry, I will. I may have smashed my first window\nEVELYN: today, but you should see what he does to them.\nLUDGATE: Well, I'm unlikely ever to win the Lonsdale belt, but I reckon I can take on Sir Archibald. Come on then, let’s go to work.\nEVELYN: Philip... thank you.\nLUDGATE: What for?\nEVELYN: For believing me. And coming back with me.\nLUDGATE: That's all right, mum.\nEVELYN: Don’t be cheeky. Come on.\nEVELYN: SCENE 44: Ext. LANYON MOOR The moor at night. A cold wind, and perhaps an owl hooting. A SENTRY\nEVELYN: whistles disconsolately. Then we hear MRS MOYNIHAN’s dogs in the distance.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN (Voice approaching) Buster! Down, boy! There’s a good boy! Good evening, young man.\nSENTRY: Evening, Ma’am. What brings you up here?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I only live just down the road. It is a free country, you\nMRS: know.\nSENTRY: So it is, Ma’am, but I’m afraid you can’t come up here tonight.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Why ever not?\nSENTRY: Just my orders, Ma'am. It’s restricted. There’s roadblocks\nSENTRY: and sentries all around this part of the moor.\nSENTRY: 134\nMES: MOYNIHAN I say, how terribly exciting. What on Earth is it all about? An unexploded bomb? Or perhaps Abel Magwitch has escaped from the prison huiks!\nSENTRY: I’m not at liberty to say, Ma’am.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I see. Well, my lad, this is the short-cut I've taken every day for the last twenty-five years, and I really don’t see why I should stop now. It would upset my dogs. I'll just pop through, shall I?\nSENTRY: I really can’t allow that, Ma'am. Sorry.\nSENTRY: A click-clack of his rifle.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Did you do that to intimidate me?\nSENTRY: Look, Ma'am, I have my orders. And my orders are that nobody is allowed past here, and I’m sorry but that includes you.**\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Young people today. You’re all the same, aren’t you? When I was your age I showed a bit of respect for my elders and betters.\nSENTRY: Listen, Ma'am —\nMRS: MOYNIHAN No, you listen to me. You think you can just barge through life getting your own way at all costs. Well, let me tell you, young man, you’re going to pay for your contemptuous attitude.\nSENTRY: I don't have any kind of an attitude, Ma’am. Now I think we've had enough — what’s that?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN This? Oh, it’s just a bit of old metal. But look what it\nMRS: does!\nMRS: A sudden whoosh of wind as the malevolent imp prajection appears,\nMRS: chuckling evilly.\nSENTRY: What the hell ~ *\nSENTRY: The SENTRY opens fire, but the imp leaps at him with a ghastly screech and we hear his dying screams as he is gobbied up.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN (Over the carnage) I imagine people will be treating me rather differently in future.\nMRS: SCENE 45: Int. GOONHILLY TRACKING STATION Background atmosphere as before.\nBRIGADIER: Don’t worry, Doctor. She’ll be under lock and key long before she reaches the county boundary.\nBRIGADIER: bocTroR It’s no good deceiving ourselves, Brigadier. She’s here already, I’m sure of it. I suspect we have only a few hours’ grace.\nBRIGADIER: What do you mean?\nBRIGADIER: pDOocTOR Even if he gets the focusing amplifier, the Tregannan won't be able to move very far for the time being. He’ll be stuck up there on the moor until reinforcements arrive.\nBRIGADIER: Reinforcements?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see, Brigadier? These creatures are linked to the Tregannan gestalt by cyber-surgery that transducts their psionic power over vast distances.\nBRIGADIER: I'm sure you're right, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, once he gets his hands on the focusing amplifier the first thing he’ll do is send a distress call to his ship, isn't it?\nBRIGADIER: His ship? But, Doctor, you said he’d been buried here for twenty thousand years. Are you telling me he’s still got a spaceship flying around up there somewhere?\nDOCTOR: It’s always difficult to explain timescale relativity to\nDOCTOR: 135\nDOCTOR: different species — they never seem to want to take it in. Tregannans live for hundreds of thousands of years, Brigadier. This little interregnum would be the equivalent of you going to sleep for, oh I don’t know, a decade perhaps. Unusual, certainly, and undoubtedly very traumatic for the individual, but well within the time-frame of the species. BRIGADIER And you say the creature gets its power from its spaceship?”\nDOCTOR: Indirectly, yes. Tregannan ships draw their energy from the home planet, and it’s transferred to the crew by psionic induction. It gives them limitless motive energy as long as they don’t stray too far from the power-source.\nBRIGADIER: So if this ship answers the distress call, the creature’s power to move around and... do things... will increase as the ship gets nearer to Earth?\nDOCTOR: Comforting thought, isn’t it? By the time the ship’s a parsec or two from here he’ll be able to regenerate himself in a physical form. Before that happens, we'd better think of something pretty good.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 46: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR The front door opens with a big creak.\nEVELYN: (Sotto voce) I still don't think it was a terribly good idea to come in through the main door.\nLUDGATE: We'll be all right. There’s no one here.\nEVELYN: That’s what you said last time.\nEVELYN: Brisk footsteps as EVELYN leads him across the hall.\nLUDGATE: Where’s this laboratory of yours, then?\nEVELYN: Straight through here. There’s a catch in the panelling. Where is it? Ah, here.\nEVELYN: A click as the panel opens. We hear the laboratory effects.\nLUDGATE: Good God...\nEVELYN: It’s amazing, isn’t it? He might be mad, but he obviously knows what he’s doing. Or at least, someone does.\nLUDGATE: What do you mean?\nEVELYN: He didn’t do all this himself. He’s got someone helping him. Whoever it is must have an incredible scientific mind.\nLUDGATE: You're right.\nEVELYN: This is the machine that overloaded. Looks like he’s nearly finished repairing it, look...\nLUDGATE: I wouldn't touch that, Evelyn.\nEVELYN: Why not?\nLUDGATE: Because I think it would be better if you moved away from it with your hands up.\nEVELYN: Philip... no...\nLUDGATE: I'm sorry, Evelyn.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You're right, Dr Smythe, he does have an incredible scientific mind.\nEVELYN: Philip, why?\nLUDGATE: I... like getting things done. Progress. Survival of the fittest. I wouldn’t expect you to understand.\nLUDGATE: sin ARCHIBALD I must confess, Dr Smythe, that I sorely underestimated you. It simply didn't occur to me that you had it in you to smash a\nLUDGATE: 136\nLUDGATE: priceless Tudor window and scramble through a fifteen-foot ornamental rose border.\nEVELYN: Well, I'm glad I was able to impress you.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I have yet to find you at all impressive, Dr Smythe. Now, if you’ll excuse us, Mr Ludgate and I have some important work to complete. Lock her up in the wine cellar.\nLUDGATE: Right. Come on, Evelyn.\nEVELYN: Oh, the wine cellar this time, is it?\nSTR: ARCHIBALD There are no windows down there, Dr Smythe. I fear there’s no wine either, for that matter, but never mind. We won't keep you waiting long.\nEVELYN: What’s your stake in this business, Philip?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Mr Ludgate has been of the greatest assistance to me in many ways, Dr Smythe. He will be handsomely rewarded.\nEVELYN: Things all set for tonight then, are they? Closer to the Golden Dawn, are we?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You will die with inane prattle on your lips, Dr Smythe. The power on the moor is increasing by the hour. The work is almost complete. At midnight tonight I shall confront my destiny.\nSIR: SCENE 47: Int. GOONHILLY TRACKING STATION\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, how many more of these Tregannans will there be on this spaceship?\nDOCTOR: Difficult to say. If it’s only a survey ship as I suspect, there’ll just be one other The crew of two bonds with the ship for life, so our friend here won't have been replaced.\nBRIGADIER: Right. Well, it’s clear that the best thing we can do is take immediate action before this fellow gets any stronger. I'll get on to Captain Ashforde.\nBRIGADIER: bOCTOR Brigadier, if you're about to suggest dropping bombs on it, you can forget it. We've already seen how powerful its psychic defence mechanisms are, even in a dormant state. If you start chucking missiles at it, they'll just bounce off - and probably flatten St Ives in the process.\nBRIGADIER: So what do you suggest?\nDOCTOR: For the time being we're just going to have to sit tight and hope your men can keep Mrs Moynihan away from the moor.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 48: Ext. LANYON MOOR Wind on the moor. Beneath it a low hum of power, underscored with faint, guttural gurgling.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Master, I am here. ] have the relic from Athens. SANCREDA's voice is still distant and echoing, as though only in MRS MOYNIHAN’s head.\nSANCREDA: You have done well.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN What shall I do?\nSANCREDA: Place the focusing amplifier on the cairn before you.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Here?\nSANCREDA: There. Now — retreat from the tumulus.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Yes.\nMRS: The low hum builds in intensity and the ground rumbles and shakes. A\nMRS: 137\nMRS: huge explosion as if a rock face were being detonated by high explosives. SANCREDA’s roaring voice suddenly zooms forward from the ‘distance’ to the ‘foreground’, signifying that the creature is finally among us.\nMES: MOYNIHAN Master! You live!\nSANCREDA: I live. At last. And now, after eighteen thousand years of\nSANCREDA: torment, here, on this primitive speck of mud in this benighted solar system, here begins my revenge!\nSANCREDA: END OF PART THREE\nSANCREDA: 138"

As you can see from his dates, it's not a particularly ancient poem — it was published in 1850, although it was based on a traditional Scottish verse which is far older — and that made it ideal for my purposes, as it’s a perfect example of the Victorian romanticism that the Brigadier is talking about in that scene. Allingham’s friends included severat of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of artists, people like Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, who provided illustrations for some of his collections of poetry. The Pre-Raphaelites were at the centre of the Victorians’ vast appetite for medievalism, mysticism and folkfore. Many of their paintings took themes lifted from Arthurian legends or ancient fairytales. Allingham's poetry did the same thing, pointing backwards to a time of supposed purity and oneness with nature, but also a time of dark deeds and mysterious supernatural creatures.",

If that’s part of his control mechanism we might still have a bargaining chip on our hands. We’ve got to get hold of it straight away.\nBRIGADIER: Right, Doctor. Back to the Institute, then. Keep me informed about the UFO, Captain.\nASHFORDE: = Wilco, sir. Good luck!\nDOCTOR: (Urgently) Come on, Brigadier!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 82: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Have you recalibrated the master terminal yet?\nLUDGATE: Nearly done. oe ence eLD Time is running short. All right, I said we'll be rea in time, okay? Sir\nLUDGATE: Archibald... oe os\nSIR: ARCHIBALD What is it now?\nLUDGATE: Is it really necessary to involve Evelyn in all this?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD I propose to make that woman suffer for her insolence. Don’t tell me you're feeling sorry for her.\nLUDGATE: She's no part of this. She’s just stumbled into it. She'll be\nLUDGATE: ler your power soon enough anyway, so why don’t we just let her go?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Oh, and have her come spelen back with the Devon Eon Cornwall Constabulary in full cry? Don’t be a fool. You are soft, Ludgate. You'll be telling me next that she reminds you of your mother. Dr Smythe stays safely locked in the cellar until I am ready to receive her penance. Now get on with your work.\nSIR: 140\nSIR: SCENE 53: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nBRIGADIER: Professor! Professor Morgan? Dr Smythe?\nDOCTOR: Nobody here, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: (Taking up a piece of paper) What's this? It’s from Professor Morgan. “Lethbridge-Stewart: Evelyn has disappeared. No news at the pub. Have gone to search on the moor.”\nDOCTOR: What? The idiot! I told him nobody was to go up there.\nBRIGADIER: Well, what should we do? Go after him?\nBRIGADIER: Door opens.\nMORGAN: Ah, Doctor, Brigadier. There you are.\nBRIGADIER: Professor! Are you all right, man?\nMORGAN: Never better. There’s a devil of a chill out there tonight, though. Doctor, I’ve been up to the dig.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know, we've just seen your note. I thought\nDOCTOR: I expressly warned you —\nMORGAN: All right all right, keep your hair on. Nothing happened, the whole place was deserted. But Doctor, the tumulus has been broken Tight open. There’s a great gaping hole in the top of the mound. It's almost as though something had burst out from inside.\nDOCTOR: That’s exactly what has happened, and you can count yourself lucky that you didn’t meet it. Now listen, from now on we must all stay right away from the moor. That's where his, power is strongest. Brigadier, I want you to stay here and hold the fort.*’ Professor, I wonder if you’d mind driving over to Pengriffen Manor and warning Sir Archibald. You could ask him if he’s seen Evelyn while you’re at it. I wonder where she’s got to. We must find that stone of hers.\nMORGAN: Stone?\nDOCTOR: Little pebble about so big, with a hole in the middle. Evelyn's got it in her handbag. It’s vital that we get it under lock and key as soon as possible.\nMORGAN: Righto, Doctor, I’li get up there straight away. And what about you?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to see an old lady about a dog.\nMORGAN: Do you mean Mrs Moynihan? I thought she was still in Greece.\nDOCTOR: I wish she were, Professor, but right now I imagine she’s\nDOCTOR: holed up in her cottage.\nBRIGADIER: 1’d better come with you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Brigadier, but I need you to stay here in case Evelyn comes back. Don’t worry, I'll be careful.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 84: Int. GOONHILLY TRACKING STATION Background atmosphere as before. CAPTAIN ASHFORDE is on the telephone.\nASHFORDE: Very well, keep me up to speed on that. Over and out. Phone down. Footsteps approaching.\nASHFORDE: Yes, what is it, Corporal?\nUNIT: CORPORAL Sir, something’s started happening to our satellite links.\nASHFORDE: What sort of something?\nASHFORDE: 141\nUNIT: CORPORAL We're losing contact with the geo-stationary satellites for this whole sector, sir. They just seem to be powering down in an expanding circle, with South-West England at the centre.\nASHFORDE: When did this start?\nUNIT: CORPORAL A couple of minutes ago, sir. It seems to have slowed down now, but there’s a blackout shadow the size of Australia up there.\nASHFORDE: Right. You’d better get me the Ministry of Defence.\nASHFORDE: SCENE 55: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR Entrance hall, We hear footsteps emerging from the hidden laboratory into the echoing hall.\nLUDGATE: I tell you, I heard something.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You're getting jumpy in your old age, Ludgate. There’s nothing here. Come on, let's get back to the laboratory.\nLUDGATE: It was like... a voice.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD It was probably your friend Dr Smythe talking to herself in the cellar. Ludgate, we don’t have time for this nonsense.\nSIR: A sudden gust of wind; a door blows open. Silence.\nLUDGATE: There! What was that?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Nothing. Just the wind.\nLUDGATE: Well, I’m going to look.\nLUDGATE: We hear his footsteps going away across the hall.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD J.udgate, that’s enough!\nLUDGATE: (Calling back from a distance) Well, there doesn’t seem to be anything out here. I’m just going to go and check the - (Voice stops abruptly; silence)\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Come along, Ludgate, we’re short of time as it is. Pause.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Ludgate?\nSIR: Pause. An imp chuckles.\nSTR: ARCHIBALD Ludgate, is that you?\nSTR: Suddenly, a massive wind whips up and whirls down into one spot as\nSANCREDA: is manifested in front of SIR ARCHIBALD.\nSANCREDA: So! Can this etiolated weakling be the creature that has so tormented me?\nSIR: ARCHIBALD What -— what are you?\nSANCREDA: Iam Sancreda. He whose power you have sought to make your own.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD Greetings, Sancreda. I have looked forward to our meeting with eager anticipation.\nSANCREDA: But nevertheless I find you unprepared, do I not? You, who have presumed to draw energy from my psionic field! You, who believe it lies within your puny ambit to harness and drive me like some primitive pack animall You, who have plotted to ensnare my. Hower: at the moment of my resurrection and make me your\nSIR: ARCHIBALD You misunderstand me, Sancreda. 1 seek a partnership with you. Together you and I can rule the people of the world. SANCREDA A partnership? Ha! I, enter into partnership with a cowering microbe to preside over the affairs of this trivial planet? Your petty ambitions are of no interest to me. Your drain on my psionic field\nSIR: 142\nSIR: has already caused me pain, anger and delay. And now it is time for you to settle your account.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD What have I to account for? I am Sir Archibald Flint, thirteenth Baronet. I have only to flick a switch, and you will be my creature!\nSANCREDA: Flick a switch! How quaint. I have only to release a psionic pulse - (a sudden explosion is heard from the laboratory) — and you will find that your switches are no longer in any condition to perform their primitive mechanical function.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD (Beginning to panic) Wait! We can do some sort of deal.**\nSANCREDA: I do not speak of deals. I speak only of debts. And yours to me is long overduel\nSANCREDA: The ghostly tornado whips up again, filled with the cackling of imps and demons.\nSIR: ARCHIBALD No! No! Noooo!\nSIR: We hear the dying screams of SIR ARCHIBALD and the manic laughter of SANCREDA.\nSIR: SCENE 56: Int. MRS MOYNIHAN’S COTTAGE The living room of a quiet little cottage. A grandfather clock ticks. A door is surreptitiously opened.\nDOCTOR: Anyone home? Hello?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN’s dogs begin barking madiy. MRS MOYNIHAN’s voice approaches from another room.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Buster! Ben! Quiet] Down! Buster! (The dogs subside) Doctor! This is a pleasant surprise.\nDOCTOR: Holiday cut short, was tt?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN (Her ‘jolly-hockey-sticks’ manner evaporates) You know, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I do. (Gently) Do you want to tell me about it?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN What is there to tell, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I thought perhaps you might like to explain to me exactly\nDOCTOR: why you’re doing all this.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Why shouldn't I?\nDOCTOR: That’s not a terribly good reason, is it?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN All my life I’ve been treated like dirt, Doctor. Deserted by people once they’ve got what they wanted. Buster and Ben are the only ones who’ve stayed with me (addressing dogs with cooing indulgence), aren’t you? Aren’t you, hey? Yes! (To the DOCTOR) And then Sancreda came to me.\nDOCTOR: Sancreda? That's his name, is it? So it’s his friendship you're after?\nMRS: MOYNIBAN Good golly, no. Friendship is a waste of effort.\nDOCTOR: I don’t happen to think so myself.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I don’t really care what you think.\nDOCTOR: So what is it you want?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Revenge, Doctor. It’s a nasty word, I know, but there it is. They do say it's a dish best served cold, don’t they? There are certain people who have treated me very badly in the past. Now I’ve been promised that I'll be allowed to give them their come-uppance. And I have to tell you I'm rather looking forward to it.\nMRS: 143\nDOCTOR: You're really a very unhappy person, aren’t you?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I don’t know what kind of doctor you are, but I can tell you I don’t have any truck with all this namby-pamby modern therapy rubbish, so if I were you I’d just shut up and concentrate on this. A scrape and a click as she picks up a heavy shotgun and aims it at him.\nDOCTOR: It’s a back-action hammer Purdey twelve-bore.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN So it is. Go on, out the door with you.\nDOCTOR: Where are we going?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Back to the Institute, Doctor. We’ve an appointment to keep. Come on, boys! Walkies!\nMRS: SCENE 57: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (CELLAR) We hear MORGAN's voice very distantly — he is upstairs in the hallway, while we are locked in the cellar with EVELYN.\nMORGAN: Hello? Anybody there? Hello?”\nEVELYN: Professor Morgan? Oh, thank goodness. (Calls) Down here, Professor! I’m in the cellar! Can you unlock the door?\nMORGAN: I think so — hold on!\nMORGAN: A rattling of keys and bolts; the door opens and MORGAN’s voice is clearer.\nEVELYN: Professor! I’ve never been so relieved to see anyone!\nMORGAN: My God, Evelyn!\nEVELYN: Look, I don’t mean to seem an ungrateful damsel in\nEVELYN: distress, but are you just going to stand there, or are you going to untie me?\nEVELYN: MORGAN Of course, I’m sorry. Let’s have a look.\nMORGAN: wrestles with EVELYN’s bonds under the next few lines, so some sound effects and the occasional grunt might be in order.\nEVELYN: Have you seen the Doctor?\nMORGAN: Yes, and he’s very concerned about some stone you found, with a hole in it.\nEVELYN: Oh, that thing again.\nEVELYN: MORGAN The Doctor says it’s very important we get it to a place of\nEVELYN: safety. Have you got it?\nEVELYN: Not here, no. It’s on the windowsill in my bedroom at the Institute. Look, what’s been going on? There was the most incredible racket from upstairs just now. I assume it was mad Sir Archibald trying out his latest bit of mumbo-jumbo.\nMORGAN: Sir Archibald... you mean you haven’t seen... (He finishes untying her) there, how’s that?\nMORGAN: EVELYN A great relief, thank you very much. What haven’t I seen?\nMORGAN: Oh dear. You'd better come upstairs. It’s not a pretty\nMORGAN: sight, I'm afraid. They go upstairs and the cellar door creaks open. Atmospheric music as\nEVELYN: surveys a scene of devastation. Shutters flap listlessly. The wind can be heard through broken windows.\nEVELYN: Well, whoever did this had no interest in historic architecture. It’s been utterly devastated. Where’s Sir Archibald?\nMORGAN: He's just over there at the foot of the stairs. Well, most of him, anyway.\nEVELYN: Oh... and... what about Philip?\nEVELYN: 144\nMORGAN: He's - in the hall. Look, come on, Evelyn, let’s get out of here. The Doctor should be back at the Institute by now.\nEVELYN: (Deep breath) Yes. Right. Come on.\nEVELYN: SCENE 38: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE The BRIGADIER is on the telephone.\nBRIGADIER: Very well, Minister... Yes, Goonhilly are keeping me informed. Then we're agreed that for the time being there is to be no action whatsoever?... Yes, I appreciate your concerns, sir, but it’s been made quite clear to us that the reprisals would be disastrous... Very well, Minister, I'll report back as scon as I can.\nBRIGADIER: Phone down. The door opens, and MRS MOYNIHAN’s dogs are heard in the background.\nBRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor, there you are at last. Look, the Minister's getting trigger-happy, so I suggest you think of something to tell —- what’s going on?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Just stay where you are, Brigadier. It is loaded.\nBRIGADIER: You realise you are committing a number of very serious offences, Mrs Moynihan?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid she’s past caring about anything like that, aren't you?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN You can blabber away all you like, Doctor. We'll just wait here, nice and comfy.\nDOCTOR: What are we waiting for exactly?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN A rendezvous with a friend of mine.\nMRS: Door opens.\nMORGAN: Ah, Doctor, Brigadier. Here we all are, safe and sound.\nEVELYN: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Evelyn! Thank goodness you’re safe. Where on Earth have you been?\nEVELYN: It’s a long story, Doctor, but I’m glad to be back.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Just move away from him and get over by the wall, Dr Smythe.\nEVELYN: I beg your pardon? What are you waving that gun about for?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I’m afraid you’re a little behind the times, dear. You see, the worm has turned. The tea-lady is in charge now.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I doubt that very much.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN I've made a bargain, Doctor. Sancreda is my ally. My business partner, if you like. I’ve helped him, and he’s helping me.\nDOCTOR: Now he’s on the loose, do you really think Sancreda is going to think twice about you?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN Why shouldn't he? We made a deal.\nDOCTOR: Rather a one-sided one by the sound of it. J rather suspect you’ve bitten off more than you can chew.\nMORGAN: I'm afraid the Doctor’s right, Mrs Moynihan.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN You can pipe down, Professor. I’ve had more than enough of your dismissive attitude to me already, without having to listen to your opinions now.”\nMORGAN: Oh, but I think you should. As opinions go, mine is a highly informed one.\nMORGAN: 145\nMRS: MOYNIHAN What are you blethering about now?”\nDOCTOR: I think you’d better move away from the Professor, Mrs Moynihan.\nDOCTOR: Low underscoring begins.\nEVELYN: Doctor, what’s happening?\nBRIGADIER: Professor Morgan!\nMORGAN: Professor Morgan is up at the dig. He’s been there for\nMORGAN: several hours now. He really should have heeded the Doctor’s warning, I’m afraid. Poor Professor Morgan. He put up quite a fight in the end, you know Chis voice gradually transforms into SANCREDA’s guttural alien tones), but once he had vacated his body I was able to make good use of the physiological imprint!\nDOCTOR: I was wondering when we’d finally meet.\nSANCREDA: = Yes, Doctor. Now you see me as I truly am.\nDOCTOR: Very nice. So, your ship’s close enough to have assisted\nDOCTOR: cellular reintegration, eh?”\nSANCREDA: You, Doctor! How can you know so much about my people? You, who exist in this irrelevant backwater of galactic space?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’d be surprised, Sancreda. Cornwall’s a popular place for tourists.\nEVELYN: You rescued me from the cellar! So — it was you who —\nSANCREDA: Yes, it was I who crushed those presumptuous insects at the Manor house. How else am IJ to reward those who seek to enslave me? And you, Dr Smythe, you were only spared in order that you might lead me to the menantolian induction loop!\nEVELYN: The... the what?\nMRS: MOYNIHAN The stone you found in the fogou, dear. Go and fetch it for him.\nEVELYN: I don’t know where it is.\nEVELYN: SANCREDA A pointless lie! You told me it was in this very building. Now bring it to me, or die!\nDOCTOR: You’d better go and get it, Evelyn. Go on. No tricks.\nEVELYN: ‘Yes, Doctor.\nEVELYN: The inner door opens, and we hear EVELYN'’s footsteps going upstairs.\nDOCTOR: All right, Sancreda, you've got everything you wanted.\nDOCTOR: You’ve regenerated yourself, your ship is on its way to pick you up, and we'll hand over the induction loop. Now, why don’t you just go in peace?\nSANCREDA: Ha! You know nothing of my wishes, Doctor. Nothing! The first of them is that this futile, tiny-minded servitor be made to pay for her intolerable importunity!\nMRS: MOYNIHAN What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Oh, leave her alone, Sancreda. She's just a sad old woman. What possible reason can you have to harm her?\nSANCREDA: Silence! Who are you, that I should give you reasons? This insufferable primitive has told me often enough how these two cringing brutes are her only friends. Let us see, then, how they respond to a, little empathic suggestion!\nSANCREDA: The dogs begin to growl and bark.\nMRS: MOYNIHAN What are you doing? Buster, what’s wrong? Ben! Get down, boy! Down!\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, what's he doing?\nBRIGADIER: 146\nMBS: MOYNIHAN Een! Ben! Stop it! Whatever you're doing, stop it! Buster! Down!\nMBS: The dogs’ snarling grows more and more vicious, and MRS MOYNIHAN's ad-lib cries more desperate, until, with a sickening snap, her cries stop abruptly. We hear the dogs eating greedily.\nSANCREDA: After eighteen thousand years, patience is a quality I possess in abundance. But that feckless woman tried it sorely.*\nDOCTOR: That’s enough, Sancreda. There’s no need for this heartless carnage.\nSANCREDA: I am swatting at flies, Doctor, nothing more. What do I care for this planet and its pathetic fauna? Soon my ship will be here. BRIGADIER And then you'll go?\nSANCREDA: Yes, I shall go. But not before there has been a final reckoning.\nSANCREDA: Door opens.\nEVELYN: Here's your induction thing — oh!\nBRIGADIER: Don’t lock, Dr Smythe.\nBRIGADIER: SANCREDA The induction loopt\nBRIGADIER: A scrape, a click and an electronic hum as the induction loop is installed. SANCREDA The function is unimpaired. Excellent! Now come, all of you. We must go to the moor. I have an appointment with my brother. Now move - or die!\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 59: Ext. LANYON MOOR Night. Wind on the moor. We hear some sort of alien computer key-pad as SANCREDA makes calculations.\nBRIGADIER: SANCREDA The ship approaches. We shall not have long to wait.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, what do you suppose he meant about a final\nSANCREDA: It is no secret. Highteen thousand years ago I was deserted on this planet by the pilot of my survey vessel. My brother, Scryfan, left me to my fate. For eighteen thousand years I have waited for this moment. And now, at long last, it approaches.\nEVELYN: So when your ship arrives, it’ll have your brother in it?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR The other half of the two-man crew, And what are you going to do with him?\nSANCREDA: He will die, Doctor. Very slowly.\nDOCTOR: I see. Won't that make it rather difficult for you to escape?\nDOCTOR: SANCREDA The vessel is very easily piloted solo, Doctor. As indeed it has been for the last eighteen millennia.\nDOCTOR: So that’s what all this boils down to, is it? A petty spot of sibling rivalry?\nSANCREDA: Petty, Doctor? You call eighteen thousand years of cold,\nSANCREDA: helpless exile petty?\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t it occur to you as rather strange that he hasn’t come back to rescue you before now?\nSANCREDA: Seryfan is no fool, Doctor. He will know what I am\nSANCREDA: thinking.\nBRIGADIER: Then why's he coming back at all?\nSANCREDA: He has no choice. Deprived of the focusing amplifier I was\nSANCREDA: 147\nSANCREDA: powerless to act, but once it was returned to me I was able to transmit an imperative recall signal direct to the ship itself. (Suddenly) Silence! Listen! He is coming. Scryfan is coming!\nSANCREDA: We hear the approaching sound of a spaceship coming in to Jand. The volume grows in intensity.\nBRIGADIER: (Shouting over the noise) Shouldn’t we take cover, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Likewise) I don't think so — it’s coming in for a smooth landing!\nDOCTOR: We hear the spaceship land.\nEVELYN: Well, well. My first spaceship.\nBRIGADIER: My first for a good few years, Dr Smythe.\nBRIGADIER: A ramp hums down. We hear SANCREDA’s voice receding as he gallops to the ship and up the ramp.\nSANCREDA: Seryfan! Seryfan! It is I, Sancreda! Come out and show\nSANCREDA: yourself!\nEVELYN: What should we do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Follow him on board, of course. I expect the ceilings will\nDOCTOR: be rather low in there, so mind your heads.\nBRIGADIER: Doctor, one of these creatures is bad enough. I don’t particularly relish the prospect of meeting another. Why don’t we just leave them to it?\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find our friend is in for a surprise, Brigadier. Come on.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60: Int. TREGANNAN SPACE SHIP. Spaceship interior effects. Not necessarily bleeping computers, but strange alien sounds that are emanating from bizarre stone machinery.\nSANCREDA: Seryfan? Scryfan, you cannot hide from me! Where are you?\nDOCTOR: (Voice approaches from doorway) He’s not here, Sancreda, can't you see? The ship is empty. You landed it by remote control, didn’t you?\nSANCREDA: I do not understand. Where is my brother?\nDOCTOR: Exactly where he’s been all along, J’m afraid. What little remains of him is neatly arranged in a cardboard tray back at the Archaeological Institute.\nBRIGADIER: You mean those fragments of animal bone you were looking at?\nDOCTOR: 1 knew they weren’t terrestrial the moment I saw them.\nEVELYN: Then his brother died here on Earth? All those years ago?\nDOCTOR: Without a doubt.\nSANCREDA: It is not true! How can he have died here?\nDOCTOR: Difficult to tell after all this time, but judging by the\nDOCTOR: charring I’d say he was shot by a heavy-impulse laser.\nSANCREDA: How can that be? Unless...\nDOCTOR: Was your ship set to take off on automatic recail, Sancreda?\nSANCREDA: It was. I was collecting geological samples some distance from the vessel. But the atmospheric conditions were worsening. This planet was far colder at that time. I was fighting off primitive carnivores with my blaster...\nSANCREDA: 148\nSANCREDA: And we cross-fade into a flashback from Scene 1... SCENE 61: FLASHBACK\nCOMPUTER: _. seven, six, five, four...\nCOMPUTER: We hear SANCREDA’s hoarse, panting breath, together with more wolves and gunfire.\nSANCREDA: Scryfan! Do not leave! Do not abandon me!\nCOMPUTER: . three, two, one...\nCOMPUTER: Engines firing for lift-off.\nCOMPUTER: _...ignition.\nSANCREDA: Seryfan! Scryfan, you have deserted me!\nSANCREDA: Spaceship taking off. We hear SCRYFAN's laboured voice faintly but clearly through the snowstorm from SANCREDA’s P_0.V.\nSCRYFAN: Farewell, my brother.\nSCRYFAN: Cross-fade back into:\nSCRYFAN: SCENE 62: Int. TREGANNAN SPACESHIP\nDOCTOR: Don't you see what happened? In your rush to get back\nDOCTOR: to your ship through the blizzard...\nBRIGADIER: ..you shot him yourself.\nDOCTOR: He wasn't taking off in the ship —- he was keeling over in the snow.\nSANCREDA: No! No, it cannot be. You are deceived!\nDOCTOR: You're the only one who's deceived, Sancreda. You’ve\nDOCTOR: spent eighteen thousand years meditating on a pointless revenge. You killed him yourself.\nSANCREDA: Very well then, Doctor. So be it. But my revenge will not be empty. My revenge will be on the planet that has been my prison for so long.\nSANCREDA: pDocTOR That’s ridiculous. Now you’re just lashing out at innocent bystanders.\nSANCREDA: Am I, Doctor? Perhaps I am. It is no matter. I shall lift off on manual control and blast this planet from space with the psionic cannon.\nDOCTOR: For pity’s sake, Sancreda, what will be the good of that?\nSANCREDA: Leave me!\nEVELYN: It’s no use trying to reason with him. His mind’s gone completely.\nBRIGADIER: How much damage could this ship do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It draws its energy from the Tregannan gestalt. He can\nDOCTOR: vaporise the Earth if he wants to.\nDOCTOR: We hear the ship powering up for flight; the background sound butlds over the remainder of the scene, adding to the sense of urgency.\nSANCREDA: Thrust chambers cleared for ignition... countdown procedure activated. Leave me, all of you! Leave the ship!\nDOCTOR: I can’t allow you to do this, Sancreda.\nSANCREDA: Navigation systems cleared and ready. You cannot prevent me, Doctor. Now, I will give you a choice. Am I going to kill you here and now, or are you going to leave the ship and die with your planet?\nDOCTOR: It’s not my planet, Sancreda, so maybe I'll call your bluff.\nDOCTOR: 149\nDOCTOR: You can’t unleash psionic pulses in a confined environment like this, not while the ship’s preparing for lift-off. Far too risky.\nSANCREDA: Correct, Doctor, so if you have no objections I shall be happy to resort to my hand-blaster.\nSANCREDA: A click as SANCREDA unclips his gun.\nDOCTOR: Evelyn! Brigadier! Get out of here! Come cn, jump!\nDOCTOR: Zap! Pow! Several shots from the blaster gun.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 63: Ext. LANYON MOOR\nDOCTOR: The moor is dominated by the exterior effects of the ship preparing for take-off, In the foreground we can hear the thumping, running footsteps of the DOCTOR and EVELYN, both breathless.\nDOCTOR: Don't stop running! Take cover. You all right?\nEVELYN: I’m all right - what about the Brigadier?\nDOCTOR: He’s still in there?\nEVELYN: Brigadier!\nEVELYN: SCENE 64: Int. TREGANNAN SPACESHIP A blast from SANCREDA’s gun ricochets off a wall.\nBRIGADIER: You'll have to do better than that, Sancreda!\nSANCREDA: You barbarian fool! You are merely delaying the inevitable. Come out and face me!\nBRIGADIER: I’ve got a better idea. Why don’t you come and face me?\nSANCREDA: Very well, if that is how you choose to die, it will be my pleasure.\nSANCREDA: A moment of suspense, followed by another shot and ricochet. Then we hear the grunts and exertion of a physical struggle, culminating in a roar as SANCREDA throws the BRIGADIER off.\nBRIGADIER: = [’ll say this for you, Sancreda. For a little chap you pack a big punch. As, I’m quite sure, does this!\nSANGREDA: (Urgent - near panic) Do not attempt to operate my blaster, you imbecile! You will be unable to channel the psionic impulse. The energy release would be enough to destroy the entire ship!\nBRIGADIER: If it comes to a choice between the whole world, or just you, me and this ship, Sancreda, I'm very clear where my duty lies.\nBRIGADIER: SCENE 65: Ext. LANYON MOOR Similar background effects to Scene 63, except that the DOCTOR and\nEVELYN: are no longer running and have taken cover. The spaceship’s ramp hums upwards.\nEVELYN: Doctor! The ramp’s closing!\nDOCTOR: Just hold tight, Evelyn. (Quietly) Come on, Alistair, what are you playing at?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 66: Int. TREGANNAN SPACESHIP\nSANCREDA: ‘You half-witted savage, do not fire the blaster!\nBRIGADIER: I have no intention of doing so, Sancreda, just so long as you lower the ramp and let me off your ship.\nBRIGADIER: 150\nSANCREDA: I could destroy you with a single thought.\nBRIGADIER: = have no doubt you could, but would you be quick enough to stop me firing this weapon in my death-throes? Now lower the ramp!\nSANCREDA: Very well. Why should I not? In less than a minute you and all your kind will be vaporised from space.\nSANCREDA: We hear the ramp lowering.\nSANCREDA: Go, then. Begone, and enjoy your final moments of existence.\nBRIGADIER: Cheerio!\nSANCREDA: Ignition in T minus twenty seconds and counting.\nSANCREDA: SCENE 67: Ext. LANYON MOOR The external engine noise of the spaceship is rising in pitch and volume.\nEVELYN: Wait! There he is! He's out!\nBRIGADIER: = (Distant) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Brigadier! Over here!\nDOCTOR: The ship takes off as the BRIGADIER runs for cover and we hear him join the others, panting. The ship streaks away into the sky.”\nEVELYN: He's getting away! Doctor, what can we do?\nBRIGADIER: Count to ten.\nEVELYN: What?\nEVELYN: SCENE 68: Int. TREGANNAN SPACESHIP We hear switches and buttons being operated.\nSANCREDA: Clear of ionosphere. Target in range. Focal length fixed and locked off. And... fire! Goodbye, Doctor!\nSANCREDA: A sudden, frantic bleeping.\nSANCREDA: Malfunction?\nSANCREDA: SCENE 69: Ext. LANYON MOOR\nBRIGADIER: Hight... nine... ten. A tiny, very distant explosion.\nDOCTOR: Did you see that?\nEVELYN: I think so,\nDOCTOR: Well, Brigadier?\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor. Unless I'm very much mistaken, Sancreda's just blown his ship and himself to kingdom come.\nEVELYN: How can you be so sure?\nBRIGADIER: Because I've got this.\nDOCTOR: His focusing amplifier!\nBRIGADIER: Thought it might do the trick. In my little tussle with Sancreda I swapped it for your coil of copper wire, Doctor. He was so beside himself by then that I’m afraid he didn’t notice.\nEVELYN: So what happened?\nDOCTOR: Without a directional focus, the power of the psionic cannon had nowhere to go. It just discharged itself on the spot. Very dangerous to meddle with Tregannan technology, you know, Brigadier, You do realise you’ve just saved the world, don’t you?\nBRIGADIER: All in a day's work, Doctor.\nBRIGADIER: 151\nDOCTOR: Here you are, then, you’d better take charge of this.\nBRIGADIER: 2 : ;\nDOCTOR: ‘Well, I expect the Athens Central Museum will be wanting it back, won't they?\nBRIGADIER: Isn't that a rather dangerous thing to have sitting in a museum?\nBOCTOR: Wot now that Sancreda is dead. These things are like driving licences.\nBOCTOR: BRIGADIER) Eh?\nDOCTOR: Non-transferable.\nBRIGADIER: Ah. Weil, why not? Doris and I have been meaning to go to Greece for years.\nDOCTOR: I must meet this Doris of yours, Brigadier.\nBRIGADIER: Well, next time you’re passing this way... incidentally, that reminds me. Where did the TARDIS disappear to?\nEVELYN: I beg your pardon? Disappeared?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Evelyn. If I’m right, then any moment now... The TARDIS materialises.\nBRIGADIER: Bless my soul.\nDOCTOR: She was here all along. It was Sancreda’s psionic field that drew us to Lanyon Moor in the first place. Once the TARDIS realised the danger, she shifted herself onto a different existential plane before Sancreda could start tampering with her.\nBRIGADIER: I see. [ think.\nDOCTOR: She’s a clever old thing, the TARDIS.\nBRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, trouble clearly hasn’t stopped following you around.\nDOCTOR: Nor you, it seems, Brigadier,\nBRIGADIER: Ah, no, I’m not having that. I’m retired. I refuse to take any of the blame. At my time of life, trouble should be confined to the occasional spot of blackfly on the nasturtiums. All the same...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nBRIGADIER: It’s nice to know we still make a good team, Doctor.\nEVELYN: So you two go back a long way, do you?\nBRIGADIER: Farther back than I sometimes care to remember, Dr Smythe.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn't believe it, but when I first met Alistair, he still had dark hair.\nBRIGADIER: So did you, Doctor, from time to time.\nEVELYN: Weil, this is all very cosy, but can I suggest that there are better places than here to catch up on old times?\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nEVELYN: Doctor, I've had a fairly difficult couple of days. It’s\nEVELYN: coming up to midnight, I'm exhausted, it’s freezing cold, and I’m starving hungry. So why don’t we ask the Brigadier very politely whether he might be able to use his influence at the pub to wangle us a late supper?\nBRIGADIER: It would be my pleasure, Dr Smythe. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nBRIGADIER: That’s settled then.\nDOCTOR: Lead the way, Brigadier.\nEVELYN: Now, this pub. What’s the situation on the chocolate puddings front?\nEVELYN: 152\nBRIGADIER: I don’t have much of a sweet tooth, Dr Smythe. I have to confess I’m more of a soup man.\nDOCTOR: I suppose I am beginning to feel a trifle peckish.\nNOTES: N.B.

It's wet, it’s foggy and it definitely isn't the Galapagos Islands.’ Nicholas Pegg (writer/director): ‘On the first day of recording, poor Colin Baker arrived at the Studio nursing a very nasty cold. His voice sounded fine, but of course we had no way of knowing whether it would degenerate over the two days that lay ahead. So I added a line to the opening scene about the Doctor having a cold, just in case the problem became increasingly audible. in the event Colin didn’t lose his voice and made a speedy recovery, thank goodness. incidentally, it was Gary Russeil’s request that { should include a line about Evelyn wanting to visit the Galapagos Islands, in anticipation of Bloodtide, fonathan Morris’s Silurian story, which I think had just been commissioned.’\nNOTES: 3.

I didn’t want to run the risk of making the character look like nothing more than a send-up at this early stage in the play, 50 we changed the line to “Stop that” and left it to Evelyn to make the reference explicit.\"\nNOTES: 6.

The poem quoted by the DOCTOR is The Fairies by William Allingham (1824-1889). Nicholas Pegg: ‘it’s a wonderfully spooky little verse, and it more or less made William Allingham’s literary reputation. As you can see from his dates, it's not a particularly ancient poem — it was published in 1850, although it was based on a traditional Scottish verse which is far older — and that made it ideal for my purposes, as it’s a perfect example of the Victorian romanticism that the Brigadier is talking about in that scene. Allingham’s friends included severat of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of artists, people like Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, who provided illustrations for some of his collections of poetry. The Pre-Raphaelites were at the centre of the Victorians’ vast appetite for medievalism, mysticism and folkfore. Many of their paintings took themes lifted from Arthurian legends or ancient fairytales. Allingham's poetry did the same thing, pointing backwards to a time of supposed purity and oneness with nature, but also a time of dark deeds and mysterious supernatural creatures.\nMORGAN: ‘Allingham’s circle of friends included other eminent figures like Thomas Carlyle and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. in fact, I dropped a Tennyson quotation into The Spectre of Lanyon Moor as well. it’s from In Memoriam, which is a long and troubled poem inspired by the death of one of Tennyson’s close friends at a very young age. It’s a meditation on eternal change and immortality, and I thought it appropriate that Sir Archibald should quote it, as he reminisces about a lost boyhood playmate a few lines later. But ’m going to be a rotter and let you find the actual quotation yourself! Oh, and come to think of it, there’s also a line from To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell in the first episode. I like a bit of poetry, you know...’\nMORGAN: 20. Line changed to: ‘That's it. No, no, higher up. Now, keep it steady while I wind it round this. Here we go.’ Nicholas Pegg: ‘I reworked the climax of Part One at a very late stage in the scripting. Among the changes was the last-minute addition of the short scene in Sir Archibald’s laboratory. This explains why it’s called Scene 144 - to save re-numbering ail the subsequent scenes — and also why the stage direction refers to a later Scene rather than describing the effects in any detail.’\nMORGAN: PART Two.\nMORGAN: 21.

For a race of three-foot high trolls, they’re a particulary vicious bunch, I’m afraid’ Nicholas Pegg: ‘Colin wanted to describe the Tregannans in a fittle more detail, so we augmented this line in the studio. There was a certain amount of good-humoured disagreement over how to pronounce “Spurgian”, before Colin eventually said, “Look, I'm the Doctor and I know how to pronounce it, thank you very much!” When we went for the take he promptly came out with an even sillier pronunciation than those we'd already mooted.

I duly examined time differences and airline timetables, so f can hold my head up and confidently say that it all works out.

He’d squeak: “Are Goonhilly keeping you informed?” to which Nick Courtney, admirably deadpan, responded, “Yes, Goonhilly are keeping me informed,” and so on: “I hope you appreciate my concerns!”/”Yes, I appreciate your concerns...” it was very funny indeed — but not quite what I was after.\nMORGAN: B51.

This is the genuine article, ’m afraid. (To SANCREDA) So, your ship's close enough to have assisted cellular reintegration, eh?

Let’s ram home the salient points one more time in case anyone has fallen asleep at the back!’\nDOCTOR: 84. Line changed to: ‘But this feckless woman tried it sorely’\nDOCTOR: 85. The countdown begins at, ‘Nine’.\nDOCTOR: 86. Line changed to: ‘Don’t stop running! We'll take cover down there. You all right?’\nDOCTOR: 87. Added dialogue - DOCTOR: ‘You had us worried there, Alistair’ Nicholas Pegg: ‘This was another tweak to boost the clarity of the situation — in this case to make it obvious that the Brigadier has taken cover with the Doctor and Evelyn. It also gave the Doctor another little moment of compassion, which is a nice bonus. I very much enjoyed writing these last scenes. Incidentally, the Brigadier’s line at the end about being “a soup man” was a little joke for Nick Courtney's benefit. He adores soup, and was very pleased to be able to establish that the Brigadier does too.’\nDOCTOR: 156\nDOCTOR: For FEAR OF LITTLE MEN By Nicholas Pegg PART ONE\nDOCTOR: Prologue (pre-credits?): On an inhospitable world of snow and ice, two aliens are conducting a planetary survey. They are brothers, and communicate by psychic power fuelled by cyber-surgical implants. The pilot is outside the ship and the leader, Sancreda, is a mile away in the snowy wastes. A blizzard is blowing up, and the pilot telepathically warns Sancreda that he must return to the ship for take-off. Power is low and they must get back to the mother ship immediately, before the storm worsens.\nDOCTOR: Racing through the blizzard towards the landing site, Sancreda uses his blaster to fight off wolves. But he is too late; as he reaches the ship it takes off. leaving him stranded on the primitive planet. He hears a psychic message:‘Farewell, my brother! As the ship leaves the planet’s atmosphere, taking its psionic power-source with it, Sancreda’s life-force fades away...\nDOCTOR: Cornwall. Late autumn. The (fom Baker era’s) present day. The TARDIS materialises on a remote, misty moor. The Doctor says this wasn’t the expected destination - something is interfering with the TARDIS. He and Sarah explore the landscape, finding an underground chamber identified by the Doctor as a fogou (an Iron Age feature unique to West Cornwall, as he will explain). They are assailed by a strange psychic attack within the fogou, and Sarah sees a vision of what seem to be malevolent imps or pixies.\nDOCTOR: A young archaeologist, Dr Ludgate, comes to the rescue and drags them clear. He explains that there's been a lot of this sort of thing going on recently. Ludgate takes them to a high-tech archaeological research Institute on the moors near Pengriffen Manor, an impressive country house owned by the elderly aristocrat Sir Archibald Flint. The Doctor and Sarah are introduced to the head of the archaeological survey, Professor Morgan, together with his eccentric colleague Dr Leamington-Smith, and finally their housekeeper, an elderly, upper-crust lady called Imogen who lives locally, is accompanied everywhere by two yapping terriers, and is about to depart for a holiday in Athens.\nDOCTOR: The Institute has been established by UNIT, and has been monitoring low but inexplicable levels of radiation and electrical activity at several of the area’s ancient sites, including stone circles and burial mounds. Attempts to survey and excavate the fogou and a nearby Neolithic tomb have been frustrated by bizarre accidents.\nDOCTOR: UNIT’s interest in the area stems from the fact that a military radar station established on the moor during World War Il experienced similar disasters and had to be abandoned; the whole affair was subject to a government cover-up.\nDOCTOR: Sarah goes to Pengriffen Manor to meet Sir Archibald, and sets to work researching the history of the area in the Manor's library. Meanwhile the Doctor and Leamington-Smith visit the tumulus which is the focal point of the excavation site. The Doctor is also curious to explore the fogou, which during previous excavations has yielded only shards of pottery and a few fragments of animal bone.\nDOCTOR: 310\nDOCTOR: As Sarah finishes her research and leaves to tell the Doctor of her findings, Sir Archibald retreats into a secret laboratory, where he tells an unknown accomplice that ‘The girl could be a problem...’\nDOCTOR: Sarah, walking back to the Institute across the darkening moor, meets a young backpacker who is holidaying in Cornwall to walk the coastal path. They walk together.\nDOCTOR: At the dig, the Doctor undergoes a terrifying psychic assault. Simultaneously Sarah and the backpacker are attacked on the moors by a monstrous army of chuckling imps. The backpacker is torn apart, and then the creatures turn to Sarah...\nDOCTOR: Part Two\nDOCTOR: The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to ‘earth’ the psychic energy, and simultaneously the imps melt away just as they are closing in on Sarah.\nDOCTOR: Back at the Institute, a shaken Sarah reveals the results of her research: the area has a long history of ghoulish folklore, strange apparitions and violent, unexplained incidents. In particular the moors are believed to be haunted by ‘little people’.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor postulates that the nature of the apparitions is alien, and that a physical manifestation of psionic energy - in the form of the imps - could explain the horrific death of the hiker.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor returns to the moor to fetch equipment from the TARDIS which will allow him to analyse and trace the source of the alien energy. But he finds that the\nTARDIS: has disappeared.\nTARDIS: Meanwhile, convinced that the answers to the mystery lie at Pengriffen Manor, Sarah absconds from her sickbed and makes her way there with Ludgate, who has agreed to help. She breaks in and explores the house, but having found the secret laboratory she is separated from Ludgate and apprehended by Sir Archibald Flint.\nTARDIS: Back at the Institute, the Doctor explains to Morgan and Leamington-Smith that even without the components from the TARDIS he can still construct a device that will trace the alien energy, albeit an inferior lash-up which will require his own mental powers to control its operation. Leamington-Smith is concerned that this will be hazardous; the Doctor agrees, but insists that the risk is necessary - if his theories are correct, the whole world is in danger.\nTARDIS: At the Manor, Flint explains to Sarah that he has been studying the psychic emanations for years. He is an occultist and now plans to harness the local psychic power in the belief that he will become a super-being, able to create and destroy by willpower alone. Sarah has seen too much, so he intends to use her as an experimental subject. Using his laboratory apparatus to focus his will, he will use telekinetic power firstly to burn out her eyes. Sarah is strapped to a couch and the experiment is prepared.\nTARDIS: The Doctor connects himself to his improvised lash-up and operates it. While the apparatus detects the source of the energy, the Doctor experiences the rage and pain of Sancreda’s thousands of years of imprisonment. As all hel! breaks loose around him (windows smashing etc.), Leamington-Smith can’t rouse the Doctor from his catatonic state.\nTARDIS: In the secret laboratory, Sarah quakes helplessly as Flint begins his experiment.\nTARDIS: 31l\nTARDIS: PART THREE\nTARDIS: The psychic energy unleashed by the Doctor's equipment interferes with Flint’s, and both overload and explode. Sarah, unharmed, is locked up while Flint carries out repairs.\nTARDIS: At the Institute, to Leamington-Smith’s relief, the Doctor snaps out of his trance (and,Tom Baker-style, says something eccentric about tea and/or Chekhov!).\nTARDIS: As expected, the Doctor’s device has fixed the source of the psionic field as the tumulus at the dig. He tells Leamington-Smith that the creature which lies dormant inside has been ‘haunting’ the region for centuries, roused from its sleep whenever the ground has been disturbed. He suggests that the fogou, which was constructed thousands of years later than the tumulus, was built as a refuge from its baleful power. Now the alien is gathering strength by sending out psychic ‘tentacles’, and may soon be powerful enough to break loose.\nTARDIS: Curiously, the Doctor’s device has also detected a secondary psionic field operating in the Eastern Mediterranean; Athens, to be precise. The Doctor realises that Imogen, the housekeeper, must already be under the alien’s control, and has been sent to Athens to recover the focusing amplifier which, once it is returned to the alien, will enable it to channel its psionic energy over far greater distances. He is right; the focusing amplifier, an unremarkabletooking piece of metal, was taken from Cornwall by a Celtic tin merchant in the first century BC (the Celts traded with Mediterranean civilisations). During the intervening centuries it has found its way to Athens, where it is now an inconspicuous exhibit in one of the city’s museums.\nTARDIS: In Athens, Imogen steals the relic from the museum, killing in order to do so. The Doctor and Leamington-Smith travel to London by UNIT helicopter in an attempt to intercept Imogen at the airport - she must be prevented at all costs from returning the focusing amplifier to the tumulus. In the ensuing chase, Imogen uses the relic's psionic properties to explode a pursuit helicopter and elude her pursuers, and makes for Pengriffen. While UNIT gives chase, the Doctor tells Leamington-Smith that they're going to UNIT HQ.\nTARDIS: Meanwhile, Sarah has escaped from her makeshift cell at Pengriffen Manor. She returns to the Institute, where Dr Ludgate tells her that the Doctor is in London. Convinced that there isn't a moment to lose in stopping Flint, Sarah persuades Ludgate to accompany her back to the Manor. There she shows him the secret laboratory, and he pulls a gun on her; it transpires that Ludgate is Flint’s acolyte. Sarah is marched back to her cell.\nTARDIS: On the moors, Imogen arrives at the cumulus. The earth bursts open and she throws the focusing amplifier into the glowing abyss.As the energy builds, Sancreda roars from the bowels of the earth...\nTARDIS: PART FOUR At UNIT HQ, a commanding officer (it would be lovely if this could be a cameo by\nTARDIS: the Brigadier, but failing that it's a temporary replacement because the Brig’s in Geneva) tells the Doctor that deep-space tracking stations have picked up a large\nTARDIS: 312\nTARDIS: object approaching Earth. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed and a speedy return to Cornwall is essential. To avoid the fate that met the helicopter, he and Leamington-Smith use Bessie, fitted with her ‘superdrive’ system, to beat the tedium of the A303.\nTARDIS: At the Institute, Professor Morgan decides to go and investigate the dig for himself.\nTARDIS: The Doctor and Leamington-Smith arrive back at the Institute. The Doctor explains that the alien beneath the tumulus is a Tregannan who has been stranded on Earth since prehistory. The psionic energy of the Tregannans can be transducted over vast distances, and over the centuries Sancreda has been periodically revived from his suspended animation by the chance proximity to Earth of a Tregannan spacecraft, whose energy-source has provided the necessary power to rouse him from his sleep. Tregannans, who live for hundreds of thousands of years, are linked by cyber-surgical implants to their own spacecraft, and now, with the focusing amplifier, Sancreda has at last been able to transmit a distress call to his brother's ship in deep space. His power is increasing as the ship approaches, and he will soon be able to regenerate himself in a physical form. It was Sancreda's psychic manipulation which interfered with the telepathic circuits of the TARDIS and drew it to Pengriffen in the first place.\nTARDIS: Professor Morgan returns from the dig to tell the Doctor that the tumulus has broken open. Leamington-Smith suggests that they investigate, but the Doctor warns him that from now on they must stay away from the moor; that is where Sancreda’s power is strongest. There is nothing they can do at the moment apart from warn people away from the arca. Morgan volunteers to go to Pengriffen Manor to alert Sir Archibald and his household staff.\nTARDIS: The Doctor, meanwhile, investigates Imogen’s cottage and finds himself held at gunpoint by the old woman, who has been promised power and riches if she obeys the will of Sancreda.\nTARDIS: At the institute, Sarah is rescued from her cell by Morgan. Shocked, he shaws her the bodies of Ludgate and Flint, horribly mutilated. The laboratory is in ruins. They return to the Institute.\nTARDIS: The Doctor tricks Imogen and escapes. Reunited with Sarah, Leamington-Smith and Morgan, he explains that the alien is on the loose. He realises the truth just as it becomes apparent: ‘Morgan’ now reveals himself to be Sancreda, who murdered the real Morgan at the dig and assumed his shape. He then volunteered to go to the Manor so that he could kill Flint and Ludgate (‘How else should I reward those who plotted to enslave me?’). Imogen has failed him by allowing the Doctor to escape, and in any case she is of no further use; Sancreda sends a psychic impulse into the minds of her two beloved terriers who, back at the cottage, turn on her and eat her alive.\nTARDIS: The Doctor condemns this heartless carnage. As Sancreda assumes his true form - ademonic hobgoblin of ancient legend - he declares that he is mercly swatting at insects; he cares nothing for the Earth, but has long ago sworn revenge on Scryfan, the brother who deserted him on this planet thousands of years before. When Scryfan’s ship arrives, Sancreda will destroy him.\nTARDIS: The Doctor points out that the spaceship is not going to enter Earth’s orbit; its trajectory is clearly taking it beyond Earth and back out into deep space. Sancreda\nTARDIS: 313\nTARDIS: demands to be taken to the ship in the TARDIS, which he has telekinetically transported inside the tumulus. Using Sarah and Leamington-Smith as hostages, Sancreda forces the Doctor to materialise the TARDIS on board the Tregannan spacecraft. They do so; but it is empty.\nTARDIS: The Doctor deduces the truth: Sancreda’s brother has been on Earth alll along. His last remains are the fragments of animal bone found in the fogou. He was inadvertently shot by Sancreda all those thousands of years ago in his flight through the blizzard to reach the spacecraft, which had already been programmed for automatic take-off. We have a flashback to the prologue scene, and we realise that ‘Farewell, my brother’ were Scryfan’s dying words.\nTARDIS: Consumed by despair and rage at being denied his long-meditated revenge, Sancreda vows that he will use the ship’s formidable weapon systems to destroy the Earth. The Doctor warns him not to do so; the thousands of years of inactivity will almost certainly have caused a static build-up in the empty spacecraft which will cause the psionic cannon to misfire. Sancreda ignores him and prepares the weaponry; the Doctor ushers his friends into the TARDIS and dematerialises just before Sancreda fires the cannon, blowing the ship and himself to oblivion.\nTARDIS: Back at the institute, the Doctor declines an invitation by Leamington-Smith to deliver a lecture about Cornish fogous at the next archaeological symposium. Leaving UNIT to coordinate the wrapping-up operation, the Doctor returns Sarah to London - this time, on her insistence, in Bessie.\nTARDIS: 314"
