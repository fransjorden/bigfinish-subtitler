I can’t see that this Doctor bloke did for him.\nFAREL: Well, we can’t know what motives that man harbours. That'll be for the Ventalis authorities—\nCRAVNET: No, I mean... he was really bashed up. I can’t see how that Doctor bloke would be strong enough to do it. And even if he was, he’d have needed a weapon and he’d’ve been covered in blood—\nFAREL: Quite. Well, yes. Tricky case. Luckily for us, we don’t have to figure it all out.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nMENACING: ROBOT MUSIC.\nMENACING: voc: Excuse me, Security Chief Farel.\nMENACING: CRAVNET AND FAREL GASP IN SHOCK.\nMENACING: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nFAREL: What the hell are you doing in here? I didn’t ask for you.\nFAREL: voc: I am a security Voc. I wondered if I could be of any assistance.\nFAREL: And how exactly do you propose to assist me?\nFAREL: Voc: I do not know, but—\nFAREL: You ‘do not know’? Oh very helpful. Typical. Useless. Pointless! Just get out!\nVOC: As you wish, sir.\nVOC: Page 54\nVOC: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 55\nDOOR: UNLOCKS AND OPENS.\nDOCTOR: Oh hello. Is it visiting time? You must be the captain.\nSELERAT: Yes, I am. SV10, identify this person, please.\nSUPERVOC: This is Tal Karus. He activated us.\nSELERAT: Is that true?\nLIV: Yes and no.\nSELERAT: Did you follow us? What the hell are you doing here?\nLIV: Looking for answers.\nSELERAT: Looking for... ? Well, you’re not invited. Get back to your—\nDOCTOR: She’s right, though.\nSELERAT: What?\nDOCTOR: I did activate SV10 and his friends, but I’m not Tal Karus.\nLIV: Told you.\nSUPERVOC: My memory indicates you are.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but that’s only because you’re programmed to expect humans to be truthful.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 56\nCRAVNET: Course, I’ve never been one for having robots around.\nFAREL: (IRRITATED WITH HIM) Yes, all right, Cravnet, shouldn’t you be out on patrol with the rest of the deputies?\nCRAVNET: Well, it’s all changed now, though, hasn’t it?\nFAREL: What? What do you mean? What’s changed?\nCRAVNET: Well... on the way here.. there were robots milling all over the place. Our murderer is hardly going to risk showing himself when—\nFAREL: Robots all over the place? But surely, the captain would’ve ordered them back into their storage compartments.\nCRAVNET: Apparently not. So they’re just wandering around trying to be helpful. I saw a couple of them fixing that dodgy aircon unit in sector nine on me way here. But that’s what robots do, innit? Useful stuff that we don’t wanna do.\nFAREL: (TRYING TO GET RID OF HIM) Well, be that as it may, I’m sure you can find something useful to do yourself, Cravnet.\nCRAVNET: I doubt it, Chief.\nFAREL: Look, just—\nCRAVNET: It’s like that poor Tal Karus bloke was sayin’ to me.\nFAREL: (SHARPLY) What?\nCRAVNET: Sorry, Chief, I'll just get on with—\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 57\nFAREL: No... wait. What did Tal Karus say to you?\nCRAVNET: Oh... we was just havin’ a drink in the refectory. Might’ve even been the night he got killed. Or maybe the night before. We’d both been working late and we were totally knackered.\nFAREL: But what did he say, Cravnet?\nFLASHBACK: TRANSITION...\nFLASHBACK: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 58\nFLASHBACK: 28. FLASHBACK INT. REFECTORY (THE PAST).\nTAL: So.. you’re saying you don’t like robots?\nCRAVNET: No, no, no.. I’m not sayin’ I like ‘em or don’t like ‘em. I just wasn’t brought up in an affluent area, was I? We didn’t see many robots... so, you know.. I’ve never got used to them. That’s all I’m sayin’.\nTAL: A lot of people feel that way about robots. More than you’d think.\nCRAVNET: Yeah?\nTAL: Oh yes. You wouldn’t believe some of the stories I’ve heard...\nCRAVNET: Stories? What stories?\nTAL: Can’t say. (THEN FORGETS HE CAN’T SAY) One in particular.\nCRAVNET: What do you mean? What ‘in particular’?\nTAL: Nothing. Haven’t you heard the rumours?\nCRAVNET: What rumours?\nTAL: Do you think that Liv Chenka likes me?\nCRAVNET: Eh? Oh, never mind her.\nTAL: I like her. She’s... you know... I like her.\nCRAVNET: Yeah, but what about these rumours?\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 59\nTAL: Eh? Rumours? Oh, well... I mean... they did their best to hush it up. I should know.\nCRAVNET: Should ya?\nTAL: Ssssssh. But... er.. well, I’ve heard people talk about it. You can’t stop rumours, can you? No matter how much security red tape you put out there... someone’s always gonna say something, aren’t they?\nCRAVNET: Are they? About what?\nTAL: Ssssh. The Sandminer.\nCRAVNET: What Sandminer?\nTAL: Sssssh. The Sandminer where everyone’s worst nightmares .... came true.\nCRAVNET: What nightmares?\nTAL: Robots.\nCRAVNET: What about ‘em?\nTAL: I really do fancy that Liv, you know.\nTAL: HE COLLAPSES, HIS GLASS SMASHING, DRINK RUNNING ACROSS TABLE.\nCRAVNET: Oi! Tal. You can’t pass out on me now.\nTAL: SNORES.\nTAL: Oh, come on! Wake up.\nTAL: (JOSTLED, MOMENTARILY PARTIALLY CONSCIOUS) robots...\nTAL: robots... they all... went bad. (AND HE FALLS UNCONSCIOUS AGAIN, SNORING) FLASHBACK TRANSITION.\nTAL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 60\nFAREL: (INTRIGUED) All the robots... ‘went bad’?\nCRAVNET: Well... that’s what he said, yeah. Poor bloke.\nFAREL: Hmm. Well. I see.\nCRAVNET: You don’t think there could be anything in it, do you?\nFAREL: Hm? Oh, probably not. But... er... well, you never know, Cravnet. Perhaps this is something you should mention to the other deputies... just in case. Make sure they’re on the look-out for anything suspicious.\nCRAVNET: You mean... you think the robots might have had something to do with Tal and Leebar’s murders?\nFAREL: I.. Hmm. I don’t know, Cravnet. But forewarned is\nFAREL: forearmed, isn’t it?\nCRAVNET: Blimey... and there’s thousands of them out there.\nFAREL: Well, you’d better get on, Cravnet, there’s a good fellow.\nCRAVNET: (MOVING OFF) Right... right, yes, Chief. Er.. See you later.\nCRAVNET: FOOTSTEPS, THEN DOOR SHUTS BEHIND HIM. PAUSE. A CLICK OF A COMMS UNIT AND A BLEEP.\nFAREL: Farel?\nPAUSE: AS HE LISTENS.\nPAUSE: I see. Of course... Elicien. If that’s what has to be done... Of course... Elicien.\nPAUSE: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 61\nSELERAT: None of which gets us any closer to the truth, Doctor! Now start talking or I’1ll get our robot friend here to use some of its mechanical muscle to persuade you—\nDOCTOR: Ah, but robots can’t harm people, Captain.\nLIV: (DUBIOUS) Yeah, right. They harmed you though.\nSELERAT: And what’s that supposed to mean, Chenka?\nLIV: I saw a robot... (REALIZING SHE’S GOING TO LOOK STUPID) well...\nSELERAT: Well what?\nDOCTOR: Do go on, Liv. I’m sure the captain will be fascinated to hear your story.\nLIV: What the hell are you up to?\nSELERAT: (ALL PATIENCE LOST) Why does SV10 think you’re Tal Karus?\nDOCTOR: Because Tal was a man with secrets.\nSELERAT: That doesn’t answer the question!\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t it?\nLIV: Why did you activate all those robots, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: For everyone’s protection.\nLIV: But I saw... ! (STOPS HERSELF AGAIN, MAKES A NOISE OF FRUSTRATION. )\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 62\nSELERAT: Out with it, Chenka! (PAUSE) Well? What did you see?\nLIV: (A LONG SIGH) All right, then.. Bas and I broke into Tal’s cabin.\nSELERAT: You did what?\nLIV: You heard.\nSELERAT: You'll be on a charge for this, Med-tech Chenka. What the hell possessed you to break into a designated crime scene?\nLIV: Oh... it was his fault.\nSELERAT: The Doctor’s? How?\nDOCTOR: Oh, didn’t you know? Everything is always my fault. Don’t worry, I’m quite used to it.\nLIV: There was a surveillance video recording in Tal’s cabin. It showed the Doctor and Tal being murdered by a robot. There... what do you make of that?\nDOCTOR: Nice bombshell, Liv. I wonder, what will you do for an encore?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 63\nSINISTER: ROBOT MUSIC.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nROBOT: Attention Voc robots. Where are you going?\nROBOT: voc:\nROBOT: In the absence of specific orders, we are following standard protocols and patrolling the ship in search of useful tasks.\nROBOT: These are new orders from SV10. All robots must assemble in Robot Bay 118. Please relay this command to all Voc and D class robots.\nROBOT: voc: Why has this command not been transmitted via the command net from SV10?\nROBOT: There has been a fault on the command net and SV10 has instructed me to relay the commands to you.\nROBOT: voc: Understood. All robots must return to Robot Bay 118.\nROBOT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 64\nSELERAT: Well, were Tal’s wounds consistent with being murdered by a robot?\nLIV: I... yes, but, I dunno! How should I know? I’ve never seen anyone who’s been murdered by a robot. Robots don’t murder people, do they?\nSUPERVOC: That is correct.\nLIV: I wasn’t asking you. But... look, he seemed to have been hit pretty hard with... with something metal.\nSELERAT: And the Doctor?\nLIV: What?\nSELERAT: Well... you seem to think you saw him murdered too. Would you care to point to his ‘fatal’ wounds?\nLIV: Oh very funny. Look, I know it sounds mad, but I know what I saw.\nSELERAT: And you saw a robot murder the Doctor?\nLIV: Yes!\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you did, Liv.\nLIV: Yes, very funny.\nDOCTOR: Which just goes to prove—\nLIV: What? What the hell does it prove except that I’m delusional?\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 65\nDOCTOR: That things aren’t always what they appear to be.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 66\nBAS: Must be nice to stretch your legs.\nBAS: voc: I beg your pardon, sir?\nBAS: You know... being locked up in those cargo bays for goodness knows how long... must be nice for you to ev... Look, I was just making conversation. Forget it.\nBAS: voc: Do you require any assistance, pilot Bas Pellico?\nBAS: No. I’m pretty good at me job, as it goes. Thanks for asking. Probably no need to thank you, though, is there? I mean, you’re not gonna get offended if I don’t thank you, are you?\nVOC: No, sir.\nBAS: Good. Did they ever think of programming you guys with proper personalities?\nBAS: voc: I am not aware of any such—\nDOOR: OPENS.\nBAS: Oh, another of your mates. Come in and join the party!\nROBOT: I am conveying an order from SV10. All robots must return to Cargo Bay 118.\nROBOT: voc: Why has this order not been—?\nROBOT: There has been a fault on the command net. I am conveying the controller’s orders in person. Please got to cargo bay 118 immediately.\nROBOT: voc: Very well. We will return to cargo bay 118.\nROBOT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 67\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THE ROBOTS LEAVE AND THE DOORS SHUT.\nBAS: Er.. you not returning to the cargo bay then?\nROBOT: No, sir.\nBAS: I suppose you want to stay and offer assistance, is that it? Because if that’s the case, I can assure you—\nROBOT: No, pilot. I will not offer assistance. I am sure that you are more than capable of piloting this ship yourself without the help of a mere mechanical slave.\nBAS: Slave?\nBAS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 68\nSELERAT: So what is the explanation, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That my assailant thought I was dead.\nLIV: I thought you were dead too!\nDOCTOR: Even after you’d had a conversation with me? That isn’t very flattering.\nLIV: Oh, ha, ha.\nDOCTOR: You see, you and the ‘robot’ both made the same mistake. You assumed I was human.\nSELERAT: And you’re not?\nDOCTOR: No. In many ways I’m quite like a human, but in many more ways, I’m not. I have, for example, something called a respiratory bypass system. It means, among other things, that if someone tries to strangle me, I can resist choking long enough to convince my attacker that I’m dead.\nLIV: Okay, but hold on, a robot would have crushed your throat and broken your neck. Are you superhuman or something?\nDOCTOR: No. And... (WITH EFFORT, LOOSENING HIS COLLAR), if I loosen my collar... you can see... I’ve got the bruises to prove it.\nLIV: Oooh... nasty.\nDOCTOR: I can’t pretend it was entirely painless.\nDOCTOR: RUMBLE AND CREAKING AS SHIP LURCHES. ALARM SOUNDS.\nALL: REACT.\nALL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 69\nLIV: Whoa! What’s going on?\nSELERAT: That idiot pilot’s lost control of my ship! Probably\nSELERAT: fallen asleep at the wheel.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Pilot Pellico! What the hell’s going on! Pellico! Come in! [CONTINUES INTO NEXT SCENE]\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 70\nSELERAT: [DISTORT]\nSELERAT: [CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS SCENE] Pellico! Pellico! Come in!\nBAS: (RECOVERING, GETTING UP) Hey, what the hell do you think you’re playing at? You’ve switched off the autopilot.\nROBOT: That is correct.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nBAS: Pilot to captain!\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Bas? What the hell—?\nBAS: I’ve got a cheeky robot up here who’s interfering with—\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Hey! You’ve cut me off!\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nSELERAT: Pilot? Pilot, are you there?\nLIV: What did he mean, a robot ‘interfering’?\nDOCTOR: What indeed?\nDOCTOR: Page 71\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 72\nBAS: Switch that autopilot back on! And give me back the comms\nBAS: unit.\nROBOT: I will not, sir.\nBAS: Oh yeah? And why not?\nROBOT: Because I must kill you.\nBAS: Oh... no! Right, that’s it!\nBAS: BUTTON HIT. ALARM SOUNDS.\nCOMPUTER: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] This is a ship-wide alert! Emergency! Emergency!\nBAS: No! Keep away from me!\nBAS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 73\nBAS: SHIP-WIDE EMERGENCY ALARM SOUNDING.\nLIV: He’s in trouble.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: Bas! Bas! What’s happening?\nLIV: Bas?!?\nBAS: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Help! It’s a robot! It’s trying to kill me! No, get back! Liv! Livvy!\nLIV: Yes, Bas, I’m here!\nBAS: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Tell them what you saw on the—Aaaaargh!\nBAS: BAS’'S VOICE CUTS OFF. THE ALARM CONTINUES.\nLIV: We’ve got to help him.\nDOCTOR: It’s too late.\nLIV: No!\nSELERAT: Oh, you’re a lot of help, Doctor. SV10, one of your robots has just murdered a member of my crew.\nSUPERVOC: That is impossible, Captain Selerat.\nSELERAT: Oh is it, indeed? Right, everyone to the bridge. Come on! You too, Doctor! I want you where I can see you!\nDRAMATIC MUSIC: AT THE RUN!\nDRAMATIC MUSIC: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 74\nDRAMATIC MUSIC: FOOTSTEPS OF THEM ALL RUNNING.\nSELERAT: Come on!\nLIV: Doctor, who exactly are you and what are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter who I am. It only matters who the murderer is. That’s what Tal was concerned about, and that’s what we should focus on.\nLIV: What do you mean, Tal was concerned about it. He was the first victim! That doesn’t make sense.\nCRAVNET: (APPROACHING) Sir! Captain!\nSELERAT: Ah... deputy... er...\nCRAVNET: Cravnet, sir.\nSELERAT: Are you and your team armed?\nCRAVNET: We are, sir. And we heard that poor pilot on the ship- wide speakers. Do you really think a robot—?\nSELERAT: Where’s Farel?\nCRAVNET: Er.. I was just in touch with him, sir. He’s on his way.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: Farel?! Farel, where are you?\nFAREL: [DISTORT]\nFAREL: (OUT OF BREATH, RUNNING) On my way, captain, sir. I’m using security passageway B997. Should be there any moment.\nFAREL: THEY ALL COME TO A HALT.\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nSELERAT: Page 75\nSELERAT: Well make it snappy, Farel.. we’ve just arrived at the\nSELERAT: bridge.\nFAREL: [DISTORT] (OUT OF BREATHING, RUNNING) Sir.\nSELERAT: Right, Crav.. er... ?\nCRAVNET: Cravnet, sir.\nSELERAT: Yes. Right... have your men draw their weapons.\nCRAVNET: Sir. Lads!\nWEAPONS: BEING DRAWN.\nSELERAT: I’m opening the door... Now.\nDOOR: OPENS. CROSS-FADE TO COMMAND DECK\nLIV: Oh... Bas. No...\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) The same as before.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS.\nSELERAT: Stay back, Doctor! I said stay back! What are you doing?\nCONTROLS: ACTIVATE.\nDOCTOR: Just switching on your autopilot. Don’t want your ship to\nDOCTOR: bump into anything, do you?\nSELERAT: Oh... oh, I see.\nFOOTSTEPS: APPROACH FAST AND STOP. FAREL\nFOOTSTEPS: AS HE ARRIVES.\nBREATHING: HARSHLY\nBREATHING: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nFAREL: Page 76\nFAREL: Oh my God... This is terrible. The wounds look the same as—\nLIV: (A RUSH OF EMOTIONS) Yes, the same as Tal! The same as\nLIV: Leebar!\nCRAVNET: He must’ve put up a fight. Look!\nFAREL: What? Oh... but.. (WITH HORROR) no...\nSELERAT: What is it?\nCRAVNET: Seems the rumours were true, Chief.\nSELERAT: What rumours?\nFAREL: (HORRIFIED) This is a severed robot hand... covered in blood. Bas’s blood.\nDOCTOR: You don’t know whose blood it is for sure.\nFAREL: (SNAPPING) Well, robots don’t bleed, do they?\nFAREL: PIECE OF METAL CLINKS.\nLIV: This looks like a piece of a robot’s face.\nDOCTOR: Seems poor Bas really did put up a fight.\nFAREL: Just what the hell are you doing here? Cravnet, have\nFAREL: men restrain this stowaway!\nCRAVNET: Sir. Lads!\nFOOTSTEPS: SCUFFLE.\nFOOTSTEPS: your\nFOOTSTEPS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR: (WINCING) Yes, thank you, gentlemen. Argh. You know, really rather like to take a look at that hand.\nFAREL: It’s evidence in a murder. No one’s touching it.\nSELERAT: (COMING TO TERMS WITH IT) So... a robot killed Bas.\nSUPERVOC: That is impossible.\nCRAVNET: Oh, yeah, you would say that, wouldn’t you?\nSUPERVOC: It is the truth.\nFAREL: Captain, this man.. the Doctor has the ability to deactivate the robots.\nSELERAT: He does. You do?\nDOCTOR: Theoretically. If I had the robot activator Mr Farel off me. But I won’t do it.\nSELERAT: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because it won’t solve anything.\nSELERAT: It might prevent a few murders.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so.\nLIV: Where are all the other robots?\nSUPERVOC: I will check on the command net.\nSOME: BLEEPS AND BURBLES.\nDOCTOR: Well, SV10?\nDOCTOR: Page 77\nDOCTOR: I'd\nDOCTOR: took\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 78\nSUPERVOC: They are all in robot bay 118. But I cannot explain why.\nSUPERVOC: SUDDEN, MUFFLED BUT SUBSTANTIAL ‘WHUMPH’ OF HUGE EXPLOSION. AN ALARM SOUNDS. CREAK OF SHIP SHIFTING.\nENGINE: NOISES SURGE VIOLENTLY. ALL HELL IS BREAKING LOOSE.\nLIV: What the hell was that?\nDOCTOR: Another bomb?\nSELERAT: Computer, ship status!\nCOMPUTER: Robot Bay 118 has been destroyed by an explosion. The ship’s hull has been breached.\nFAREL: What? We’ve got to do something! Captain!\nMORE: DANGEROUS CREAKS AND CRUNCHES IN THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP.\nSELERAT: Shut up, Farel! Computer, continue damage report. Any casualties?\nCOMPUTER: Crew transponder readings indicate multiple casualties.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: This is Captain Selerat to all sectors. Report immediately.\nSELERAT: AS THE COMMS LINK IS MADE, WE HEAR THE SCREAMS OF CREW DYING IN THE BACKGROUND ON DISTORT, TOGETHER WITH A GREAT RUSHING OF AIR.\nTECH: [DISTORT] Captain! Aaargh! Captain! We can’t... Aaaaaargh!\nTECH: STATIC AND COMMS CUT OFF.\nTECH: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 79\nCOMPUTER: Transponder readings indicate the entire tech support and engineering crew have been wiped out.\nCOMPUTER: CREAK AND CRUNCH AS SHIP LURCHES. BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nSELERAT: My God... that was our manoeuvring boosters... sheered clean off the hull!\nANOTHER: ALARM SOUNDS AS EVERYONE CRIES OUT IN SURPRISE, GASPING, FALLING.\nDOCTOR: (OVER THE DIN) Captain, with your engineering section wiped out, you need to transfer control of whatever's left of your engines to the bridge—\nSELERAT: I know! Computer... do.. do what he just said! Transfer control.\nCOMPUTER: Transferring.\nCOMPUTER: BLEEPS AND BURBLES.\nSELERAT: (GROANS AS HE WRESTLES WITH THE CONTROLS. CONTINUE UNDER...) Activate emergency bulkheads! Seal off the breached sections. Stabilize engine power.\nSELERAT: THE CREAKING AND GRINDING OF THE HULL ETC STARTS TO CALM DOWN. ALARMS SHUT OFF.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE, INTENSE) And they fought to the last man against the terrible, robotic foe.\nLIV: Doctor, will you just stop being mysterious for one moment and tell me what the hell is going on?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you realize, yet?\nLIV: Well, obviously not!\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 80\nDOCTOR: We’re trapped in someone’s idea of a fight for survival.\nFAREL: Someone’s idea? What the hell are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: That’s the way it’s meant to look by the time we arrive at Ventalis Control. It’s like a drama playing out and we're the unwilling players. A small band of isolated humans, fighting for survival against a horde of murderous robots who are killing us off one by one.\nLIV: But why have the robots in the cargo bay just been destroyed?\nDOCTOR: Because the real drama isn’t the robots wiping out the humans... It’s the humans wiping out the robots!’\nDOCTOR: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 81"

Don’t you understand? Murdered by a robot! The person you thought was Tal Karus is... someone else! This man here. The Doctor. You’ve been lied to.\nSUPERVOC: Is that true?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid it is, SV10. A necessary deception.\nSUPERVOC: Then I must accept the commands of the senior officer present.\nSELERAT: Good! That’s me. Shut yourself down!\nSELERAT: PAUSE.\nSELERAT: Has he done it?\nDOCTOR: He’s done it. Robots are faultlessly obedient, unless tampered with, you know.\nFAREL: And you think that’s what’s happened? That someone’s\nFAREL: tampered with the robots, set them on a killing spree?\nDOCTOR: No.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 82\nCRAVNET: Like what happened on that Sandminer?\nSELERAT: What Sandminer?\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter. That’s not what’s happening here.\nLIV: But Tal was something to do with that, wasn’t he? That Sandminer. You said he had secrets. He had secret computer files in his room. Tell us what his secrets were, Doctor?\nFAREL: We shouldn’t be listening to this man. He’s a stowaway... and he may well be working with the robots.\nCRAVNET: You mean... he’s the one who’s messed with their robot brains?\nFAREL: I don’t know, but we shouldn’t take any risks. He should be locked up, captain.\nSELERAT: All right—\nLIV: Not until he tells us the truth! I’m sick of all his mysterious hints and clues. He knows exactly what’s going on here and it’s about time he told us! Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Tal was working for the Kaldor City Company.\nCRAVNET: The company who ran that Sandminer!\nSELERAT: I repeat, what Sandminer?!!\nCRAVNET: I knew it!\nLIV: There was a Sandminer.. and all the robots were reprogrammed to kill the crew.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 83\nSELERAT: (GOBSMACKED) Reprogrammed to... ? I don’t believe it. We’d’ve heard about it.\nDOCTOR: The company hushed it up. They were worried that there might be more fanatical followers of Taron Kapel out there.\nSELERAT: Who’s Taron Kapel?\nLIV: He was a robotics genius who spent his entire life with robots. He went mad and—\nSELERAT: Look, wait a minute! How do you know all this, Chenka?\nDOCTOR: She’s read Tal’s secret files.\nLIV: I know... I’m in trouble. I’m going to lose my job. But I’d rather lose my job than... well, get murdered.\nDOCTOR: The company put an agent on this ship to make sure that the robot cargo wasn’t interfered with by any other potential madmen.\nCRAVNET: Followers of this Taron Kapel bloke, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nSELERAT: So why did a robot murder Tal?\nDOCTOR: Tal wasn’t murdered by a robot. Someone found out about him and wanted him silenced for some reason. I’m not sure why.\nCRAVNET: Obvious, innit? Because he knew all robots have started killing people! That the Sandminer thing wasn’t an isolated incident, that’s why!\nLIV: And I did see a robot kill Tal.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 84\nDOCTOR: You saw it kill me too, remember?\nFAREL: I’ve heard enough of this nonsense! Cravnet, take the Doctor away and lock him up.\nDOCTOR: What are you going to do with SV10?\nFAREL: With that?\nFOOTSTEPS: AS HE APPROACHES IT. THE METALLIC UNSCREWING OF ITS HEAD.\nFAREL: (WITH SOME EFFORT) Well... ugh!\nHEAD: HITS THE FLOOR WITH A CLANG.\nHEAD: I’d like to see it do any harm with its head missing. And... (WITH FURTHER EFFORT)\nITS: HANDS CLANG TO THE FLOOR. With no hands to strangle people for that matter!\nDOCTOR: Expertly done, Chief Farel.\nFAREL: Take him away!\nDOCTOR: (VOCAL SOUNDS AS HE’S MANHANDLED OUT OF THE BRIDGE) Liv!\nFOOTSTEPS: AS SHE MOVES TOWARDS HIM.\nLIV: What is it? Why am I even bothering to listen to you?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERS) Look at the head injuries. Study them!\nFAREL: Get him out of here! Now!\nFAREL: THE DOCTOR IS WRESTLED OUT THROUGH THE DOORWAY. DOOR\nCLOSING: BEHIND HIM.\nCLOSING: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 85\nFAREL: What did he just say to you?\nLIV: Mm? What? Oh, just some weird rubbish... He’s completely nuts.\nFAREL: Yes, well... quite. Right, captain, I suggest—\nSELERAT: That you shut up and listen to your captain! (PAUSE FOR EFFECT) Thank you. Reluctantly, I’ve come to the decision that we have to call for a Company security vessel to intercept us. We just can’t risk any of these murderous robots getting off the ship at Ventalis Control. Among other things, it’d be very bad for business.\nFAREL: I agree, sir.\nSELERAT: How nice of you, Farel.\nFAREL: And our survival must come first.\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 86\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THEY MOVE ALONG CORRIDOR.\nCRAVNET: There’s a good boy, Doctor. No point struggling.\nDOCTOR: Quite. Tell me, deputy, do you really believe the robots are killing people?\nCRAVNET: What do you mean? Course I do. The evidence is staring us all in the face, innit.\nDOCTOR: But I was supposedly murdered by a robot. And yet, here I am. Fit as a fiddle.\nCRAVNET: Eh?\nDOCTOR: How do you explain that?\nCRAVNET: I don’t have to. That’s not my job, is it?\nCELL: DOOR OPENS. Get in!\nDOCTOR: How kind.\nFOOTSTEPS: ENTER. CELL DOOR CLOSES.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED, BEHIND DOOR) Just one thing, deputy!\nCRAVNET: (IMPATIENT) What?\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED, BEHIND DOOR) If you don’t trust me, why not go and ask Liv about it?\nCRAVNET: Oh... shut up!\nCRAVNET: REFRAIN OF THE MUSIC FAREL WAS LISTENING TO.\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 87\nSELERAT: This is Lt Commander Selerat aboard the cargo ship Lorelei calling Kaldor City Tower.

You aren’t.\nSELERAT: What? What are you talking about, man?\nFAREL: [DISTORT] It’s the robots—\nSELERAT: What about the robots?\nFAREL: [DISTORT] They’ve somehow got onto the hull and seized control of the long range transceiver antenna.\nSELERAT: Got onto the... ? But.. all the robots have been blown up, haven’t they?\nFAREL: [DISTORT] My security grid shows robot activity in Robot Bay 112. They’ve somehow been activated!\nSELERAT: But how is that possible? Who could have done that?\nPROLONGED: STATIC BURST. Farel? Farel! Come in! Can you hear me? SHIP-WIDE ALARM SOUNDS.\nCOMPUTER: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Ship-wide communications have been activated.\nSELERAT: What?

Wait a minute...\nCONTROLS: OPERATED. NEGATIVE BEEPS.\nCONTROLS: I can’t operate the navigation controls. The bridge has been locked out.\nFAREL: [DISTORT] What?!! But... oh no, it must be the robots!\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 93\nFAREL: KNOCK ON THE DOOR.\nLIV: (MOROSE) Who is it?\nCRAVNET: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE DOOR) It’s me.\nLIV: Who?\nCRAVNET: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE DOOR) Deputy Cravnet.\nLIV: Who? Oh... yes...\nCRAVNET: (MUFFLED) Well... can you unlock the door, please?\nLIV: Er... okay.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nCRAVNET: Why is it no one seems to remember who I am?\nLIV: Er.. sorry. Got a lot on my mind. What do you want?\nCRAVNET: Er... Well. Um. Yeah.\nLIV: What? Look, don’t go weird on me, Cravnet. I’m having a bad enough day as it is. We all are.\nCRAVNET: You heard what that robot said? On the speakers?\nLIV: Yes, of course, why do you think I had the door locked?\nCRAVNET: Oh yeah. Course. (SIGHS) Yeah. It’s all a bit scary, isn’t it?\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 94\nLIV: Look, I’m a rather busy with something, so if you’re not here for any particular reason, I-—\nCRAVNET: Eh? No, there was something. Actually. Um.\nLIV: Well... what?\nCRAVNET: It’s just that.. something that Doctor said—\nLIV: Oh... something that Doctor said! I feel like I wouldn’t be in this mess if I hadn’t listened to ‘something that Doctor said’.\nCRAVNET: He said that if I didn’t believe him... I should check with you.\nLIV: About what?\nCRAVNET: Er.. I don’t know, really. Um. All this robot stuff, I suppose. Sorry to bother you. Forget it. I’1l.. I’1l go.\nLIV: No. No. Hang on.\nCRAVNET: What?\nLIV: I know what he meant. He told me to study the wounds on the victims.\nKEYPAD: TAPPED. BURBLE OF READ-OUTS.\nKEYPAD: Nice of him, wasn’t it? To ask me to have an in-depth look at the fatal wounds of two people who I really... (EMBARRASSED, STOPS HERSELF) well, anyway. Here are the scans of the wounds. What do you make of them?\nCRAVNET: Well... er.. I’m not really an expert on—\nLIV: (SIGHS) I’1l tell you, shall I? The scans show that Tal Karus and and Bas Pellico were killed by blows from a\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 95\nLIV: robot hand... the same robot hand that was left on the bridge, in fact. The surface-mapping shows a 98% match. Close enough. I don’t know for sure about your friend Leebar. His body was incinerated before I could check it.\nCRAVNET: Yeah. I know.\nLIV: But I did get a look at him beforehand... and I’d say he died the same way.\nCRAVNET: So.. what’s the Doctor getting at then? These people were killed by robots. I knew that. Case solved. The robots have turned into murderers. And after what they said just now on the ship-wide comms... ‘the robots will rise’ and all that.. I don’t know why I even came her to ask you about it.\nLIV: Maybe because, like me, you’ve got a nagging doubt. Look!\nLIV: BURBLE OF READ-OUTS.\nCRAVNET: What? What are you showing me?\nLIV: Oh, he’s clever, that Doctor, isn’t he?\nCRAVNET: Is he?\nLIV: Oh yes. It’s like he knows all the answers, but just wants us to find out for ourselves. He knew I’d look into this. I suppose that means he has faith in me for some bizarre reason.\nMORE: COMPUTER BURBLES ON SCREEN.\nMORE: See that? That shows the amount of force a robot can apply. You see? They’re programmed for heavy work as well. They could bend a bulk-head door, hold up a collapsed roof if they needed to... They were built like that so that they could save human beings in dangerous Situations, I suppose.\nCRAVNET: Save us? They’re killing us! You heard what that robot said!\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 96\nLIV: But don’t you see? The force of the blows used to kill Tal and Bas... Well, it was the same level of force a human being would use. If a robot had really ‘gone bad’, wouldn’t it use its full strength?\nCRAVNET: Well... (STUMPED) I dunno. Maybe... it.. Yeah, maybe it wanted to make it look like a human had done it.\nLIV: (UNSURE) Er...\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 97\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nFAREL: (PANICKING) Captain! Captain, come in, please. Are you there?\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Er yes, Farel, but I’m rather busy trying to get control of the ship. This had better be urgent.\nFAREL: It is, sir. It is. Sir, I’m tracking robot movement on the security scanners. They’re not just on the hull, they’re all over the ship. Moving out into every sector.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] What are they up to?\nFAREL: Isn’t it obvious after that transmission? (SUDDENLY\nNOTICING: SOMETHING) Oh no.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] What is it?\nFAREL: There’s a group of them on their way to you, heading for the bridge! And... and the med-centre.. and here!

So it would seem. Shall we go?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 105\nMUCH: GRUNTING OF EFFORT FROM LIV AND CRAVNET AS THEY PUSH THE ROBOTS OUT.\nLIV: (EFFORT) Get... get out!\nLIV: voc:\nLIV: (BEING SHOVED OUT) Please do not shove. We are only here to help you.\nDOOR: CLOSES. LIV AND CRAVNET MASSIVELY OUT OF BREATH.\nDOOR: VOC AND VOC 2:\nDOOR: (MUFFLED BEHIND DOOR) Why have you locked us out? We only wish to help you.\nLIV: (OUT OF BREATH) You... you all right?\nCRAVNET: (OUT OF BREATH, TERRIFIED) Er... yeah... I dunno. Did you hear Chief Farel?\nLIV: Yeah.\nCRAVNET: (TERRIFIED) They’ve killed him, haven’t they?\nCRAVNET: KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. Will that door hold them?\nCRAVNET: voc: (MUFFLED) Please let us in.\nLIV: Let’s hope so.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 106\nGUN: POWERS UP.\nSELERAT: Right... okay, I’m armed! Now, you’1ll do as I say!\nSELERAT: Understand?\nSELERAT: voc 4: Please put the gun down, captain. There is no need—\nSELERAT: Reset the controls. Power down the engines and change\nSELERAT: course!\nSELERAT: voc 4: I am unable to comply, captain.\nSELERAT: Do as I say or I’1l1 fire!\nSELERAT: voc 4: Please put down the weapon—\nSELERAT: Right! That’s it!\nGUN: FIRES.\nGUN: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 107\nGUN: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND VOC 5.\nDOCTOR: I really do think it’s time someone calmed the situation down. I wonder, would you allow me to make a ship-wide communication?\nDOCTOR: voc 5: My security log shows that Tal Karus is to be given full co-operation. Please proceed.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMPUTER: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Ship-wide communication.\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nDOCTOR: Ladies and gentlemen. There is no need to panic. The robots are not attacking. This is all just a terrible misunderstanding.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Are you crazy? We just had a bunch of them in here trying to kill us!\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Are you sure, Liv?\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Sure? What do you mean? Of course I’m sure!\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] As sure aS you were when you saw me murdered? What did you find out about the murder victims, Liv?\nCRAVNET: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nCRAVNET: (HE'S LOST IT) Look! They were attacking us! I had to fire at them to stop them! So what if they didn’t hit Tal or Bas that hard?!? They hit them hard enough to kill them, didn’t they?\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] They hit them only as hard as a human would. Isn’t that right, Liv?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 108\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Yes... but—\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Think, Liv. Think.\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] I am thinking Doctor. I’m thinking about what we heard that robot say. It said they were going to kill us all.\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nDOCTOR: And that robot you saw murder me... what did that say? Don’t give in to blind fear. Those robots aren’t attacking you.\nCRAVNET: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] They are! They were!\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Did they do anything to harm you? Are either of you injured? [CONTINUES IN NEXT SCENE]\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 109\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] [CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS SCENE] Well?\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nLIV: Cravnet. (DEEP BREATH) Give me the gun.\nCRAVNET: Wh... ? What are you going to do?\nLIV: Trust me. Just give me the gun!\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Liv? Liv? Can you still hear me? Liv!\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 110\nGUN: FIRES. IMPACT.\nGUN: voc 4: Please do not fire that weapon at me. You are damaging my systems.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: Doctor! Doctor! What the hell’s going on? Why are you out of your cell again?\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Never mind that, Captain. I think Liv is about to take a leap of faith. How are you?\nSELERAT: I’m surrounded by robots, I’m out of ammunition and the ship’s been rigged to crash into Ventalis.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 111\nLIV: Hand it over, Cravnet.\nLIV: SOUND OF GUN HANDED OVER.\nCRAVNET: Okay... so.. SO now what? Oh no. Please. You’re not gonna— ?\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOOR: (FALLING APART) Oh no, no, no! No! Don’t let them in!!!\nROBOT: FOOTSTEPS.\nROBOT: CRASH OF THREATENING MUSIC. THEN SILENCE.\nROBOT: voc: Can we be of assistance?\nLIV: (TENTATIVELY) Um... No thank you?\nLIV: voc: Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need any assistance.\nLIV: Thanks...\nCRAVNET: voc: Are you sure your friend does not need any assistance? He\nCRAVNET: seems to be distressed.\nLIV: Yes. Er... he does.\nCRAVNET: (MURMUR) They’re going to kill us.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Doctor. I’ve let the robots in.\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] Have they attempted to harm you in any way?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 112\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] No.. but they’re worried about Cravnet.\nCRAVNET: Get them away from me!!!\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nDOCTOR: I think our poor deputy might be suffering from Robophobia — a debilitating fear of robots that cripples the rational mind.\nDOCTOR: Voc: We only wish to help you.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS ROBOTS ADVANCE.\nCRAVNET: (WHIMPERING) They want to kill us all!\nLIV: I.. I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nDOCTOR: You’re right, Liv. There’s nothing wrong with these robots. That’s what Tal discovered. And he also discovered that there was someone on this ship who was suffering from Robophobia. That’s the real danger here, that a whole civilization could be consumed by an irrational fear.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nSELERAT: You’d better be right, Doctor. Because these robots are refusing to alter our course. Which means we’re still going to crash into Ventalis.\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] What?!?\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 113\nDOCTOR: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY]\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Captain. Whoever jammed your controls, it wasn’t the robots. I’1l1 come and see what I can do. Liv, can you look after Cravnet?\nLIV: [SHIP-WIDE TANNOY] I’1l do my best to calm him down.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 114\nCRAVNET: IS WHIMPERING.\nCRAVNET: The robots... the robots are going to kill us.\nLIV: No, Cravnet, I don’t think they are. Now, I’m going to give you something to make you feel less stressed, all right?\nCRAVNET: No! Remember Farel! They killed Farel1!\nLIV: Yes... but.. you saw those robots who were in here just now. They were perfectly friendly. (SUDDENLY HITS HER) Oh no. Maybe it’s only one robot that’s gone bad.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 115\nDOCTOR: Right then... That’s the end of the robot invasion. (NOTICING THE ROBOT HAS CHANGED) Oh... where’s the other Voc? Wait a minute... you’re SV10, aren’t you? I thought you’d lost your head.\nROBOT: I have been reassembled, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: How nice for you. Wait a minute. How do you know my name?\nROBOT: I failed to kill you the first time. I will not fail again.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: SOUND OF ROBOT SMASHING ITS FIST DOWN AND METAL FIST\nCRASHING: INTO THE WALL.\nDOCTOR: Ha! Missed me! Try again!\nROBOT: You must die!\nDOCTOR: Must I? Like I died before, you mean? Except that you messed it up, didn’t you? You didn’t know I wasn’t human!\nANOTHER: SMASH INTO THE WALL.\nANOTHER: Ooh! Missed me again. Your reaction times are a bit slow for a robot’s aren’t they? And if it was you who tried to kill me before, the pressure you brought to bear on my throat was a little below par!\nANOTHER: SMASH.\nDOCTOR: Missed again! So, come on, SV10, who are you really?\nROBOT: I am SV10 and you must die. All humans must die.\nROBOT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 116\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t think you’re SV10 at all. SV10 lost his head and arms, didn’t he? But who picked them up? Who needed a replacement head, because this ship’s pilot had smashed it in? Who needed a new hand because it got broken off in the attack? No, you’re not SV10 at all. (SUDDENLY CHOKING) Argh! You tried choking me before! It didn’t work!\nROBOT: (WITH VERY UNROBOTIC, INTENSE EFFORT) This time... I willl... make sure... Doctor!\nROBOT: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nROBOT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 117\nROBOT: PART 4.\nROBOT: Aargh!\nFOOTSTEPS: STUMBLE AND BODY FALLS.\nDOCTOR: (WINDED) Phew... Ah... Thank you.\nFOOTSTEPS: APPROACH SLOWLY.\nLIV: (APPROACHING SLOWLY, DAZED) I... I er... I’ve never actually fired a gun before. Never really needed to.\nDOCTOR: I’m not exactly a fan of violence, but I’m glad you broke the habit of a lifetime for me.\nLIV: (DAZED) Mm? Oh... well, I heard you. You left the comms unit on.\nDOCTOR: Did I? Oh.. Yes, that was lucky. Very lucky, actually.\nLIV: I had Cravnet’s gun in my hand. I just came running and... God. I actually hit him.. it.. no, him. I don’t believe... He’s bleeding.\nDOCTOR: I think you just winged him.\nLIV: (MEDICAL MODE FOR A MOMENT) Bullet seems to have gone straight through the trapezius... (BACK TO SHOCK) Er... So... what are we saying here? This.. this isn’t a robot. Just someone wearing a robot’s mask and clothes?\nDOCTOR: Take the head off and find out.\nLIV: You know who it is, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Er.. I have a few ideas. But why don’t you make sure?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 118\nDOCTOR: SOUND OF HEAD BEING PULLED OFF.\nLIV: Farel. It’s Chief Farel.\nDOOR: OPENS. ROBOT FOOTSTEPS. Oh no. Stay back! Stay back or I’1l shoot!\nDOOR: voc: Please do not shoot at us.\nDOCTOR: Liv... Liv... these are real robots. They’re not going to hurt us... remember?\nLIV: Oh... oh, yes. Sorry. Sorry.\nLIV: voc: There is no need for an apology. Can we be of assistance?\nLIV: Er.. yes. Please apply pressure to this man’s wound.\nLIV: voc: Complying.\nLIV: SOUND OF PRESSURE BEING APPLIED.\nFAREL: voc: Why is this human dressed as a robot?\nDOCTOR: It’s a long story, and right now I have to get the command deck.\nLIV: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because this ship is on a collision course with Ventalis.\nLIV: Oh yes. I’m coming with you. Robots... please carry this man to the bridge. There’s a medi-kit there we can use.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 119\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 120\nLIV: voc 5: May I help you up, captain?\nSELERAT: Er... Oh.. thank you. (GETTING TO HIS FEET) Look, I’m sorry about all that shooting.\nSELERAT: voc 5: That is perfectly all right, sir. I will have the damage repaired later.\nSELERAT: I er.. there was a bit of a misunderstanding, you see.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS DOCTOR, LIV AND ROBOTS CARRYING FAREL ARRIVE.\nLIV: (APPROACHING) One hell of a misunderstanding.\nSELERAT: Wha—? Who’ve you got there?\nDOCTOR: Your security chief.\nSELERAT: What?\nLIV: Put him down on that control panel, please, robot.\nVOC: Yes, med-tech Chenka.\nCLUMPH: AS FAREL IS PLONKED DOWN.\nSELERAT: Farel? But the robots killed... Oh no, hang on, they couldn’t have, could they? Wait a minute... Why’s he dressed as a robot... ?\nLIV: And get me that emergency med-pack from the wall.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 121\nVOC: Yes, med-tech Chenka.\nROBOT: WALKS OVER AND WE HEAR MED-PACK BEING DETACHED AND\nBROUGHT: BACK, UNDER FOLLOWING...\nSELERAT: (PENNY DROPS) Ah. You don’t mean it was him all the time? Do you? Dressed as a robot... killing people? And then he faked his own death?\nDOCTOR: I like to see a fine human mind finally put to good use. Shall we see if we can get control of your ship again, captain?\nSELERAT: What? Oh, yes.. The nav controls are—\nDOCTOR: Yes, I see them. (FIDDLING WITH CONTROLS) Hmm... interesting. Let’s see.\nCONTROLS: CONTINUE TO BURBLE AND BLEEP.\nSELERAT: Computer. Time to impact with Ventalis?\nCOMPUTER: Time to impact. One hour.\nCOMPUTER: ZIP OF BANDAGE BEING UNWRAPPED.\nFAREL: (GROANS. MUMBLES) Elicien.\nLIV: One hour? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m working on it, I’m working on it. In the meantime, I’ve got some more bad news.\nDOCTOR: BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nSELERAT: More?\nDOCTOR: You carry a lot of spare fuel on this ship, don’t you, captain?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 122\nSELERAT: Saves time refuelling. It means we can get back home quicker.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately, it also means that if this ship explodes, on impact, enough energy will be released to destroy the entire planet Ventalis.\nSELERAT: And Chief Farel did this?\nSELERAT: BURBLE OF CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. He’s routed the controls through his security centre.\nLIV: Why the hell did he do it?\nDOCTOR: Because he’s robophobic.\nSELERAT: Why would that make him want to kill all of us and blow up Ventalis?\nDOCTOR: Remember that message we heard.\nLIV: From that robot? Saying they’d kill everyone?\nDOCTOR: That’s the one.\nSELERAT: That was sent to Ventalis.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nLIV: So when we crash into Ventalis and blow it up.. the authorities will blame the robots.\nDOCTOR: Farel wanted a robot disaster that your authorities couldn’t hush up. And what do you think the result will be after we’re all destroyed?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 123\nSELERAT: What... apart from us all being very dead?\nLIV: They’1l shut down all the robots. Scrap them. After this, no one will want a robot anywhere near them.\nDOCTOR: With disastrous consequences for human society in this sector of the galaxy. There are countless planets in the neighbourhood who are totally reliant on robots.\nSELERAT: We should know. We deliver them.\nDOCTOR: And besides... I’m rather fond of your robots.\nLIV: Fond? Why?\nDOCTOR: They’re helpful, polite, intelligent, sophisticated. Killing them all would be little short of genocide.\nLIV: Robot genocide. Is there such a thing?\nFAREL: (COMING ROUND, GASPING) Robots!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Chief. How are you feeling?\nFAREL: (SUDDENLY IN A RAGE) Get them off me! Get off me!\nFAREL: voc: Very well, sir.\nFAREL: Don’t talk to me!\nFAREL: BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nDOCTOR: Ah... I thought as much.\nLIV: As much as what?\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 124\nDOCTOR: Mr Farel, you’ve locked this ship’s navigation controls. We need the code to unlock them. What is it?\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nFAREL: Hello.\nLIV: What’s he doing?\nSELERAT: He’s got a comms unit. Who are you talking to, Farel?\nFAREL: Yes, Elicien. The robots are attacking. Killing everyone!\nLIV: That’s not true.\nDOCTOR: He believes it is.\nSELERAT: Who’s he talking to?\nDOCTOR: Elicien?\nFAREL: They want to crash the ship into Ventalis and destroy all the humans there.\nLIV: No, that’s you—\nFAREL: They’re mad! They say they protect you, look after you, but they’re liars!\nSELERAT: What’s he talking about?\nFAREL: They’re killers! Yes! Mad killers! I have to escape! I must be the only survivor, to warn the human race about the danger of the robots! They must all be destroyed. Ripped apart! Melted down!\nFOOTSTEPS: AS HE DASHES.\nFOOTSTEPS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 125\nLIV: Where’s he going?\nSELERAT: But.. he’s running straight at the wall. Farel!\nSELERAT: BLEEP OF BUTTON. CONCEALED DOOR OPENS.\nFAREL: (AS HE RUSHES THROUGH THE DOOR) I’ve got to get out of here!!!\nDOOR: CLOSES.\nDOCTOR: A concealed doorway.\nSELERAT: I never knew that was there.\nDOCTOR: Oh, they’re all over your ship, captain. Security passageways.\nLIV: Just the kind of thing a security chief needs, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and if he wants to be the only survivor, my guess is he’1ll be making a short cut straight to an escape pod of some kind.\nSELERAT: We only have one lifeboat.\nDOCTOR: Then we’ve got to get to it and stop him.\nSELERAT: Computer, activate guide beacons to the lifeboat bay.\nCOMPUTER: Activating.\nCOMPUTER: A SIREN BRIEFLY SOUNDS. THEN THE SOFT PULSING SOUND OF\nORANGE: LIGHTS. THIS CONTINUES.\nSELERAT: Right, Doctor, all you have to do is follow the orange lights. They’1ll lead you straight to it.\nSELERAT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 126\nCOMPUTER: Are you evacuating the ship?\nLIV: Well, Doctor? Are we?\nDOCTOR: Not yet. Captain, I need you to wait here. Be ready to input the unlocking code as soon as we get it off Farel.\nLIV: What makes you think he’1l tell us?\nDOCTOR: Boundless optimism. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 127\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND LIV RUNNING.\nPULSING: SOUND OF ORANGE LIGHTS.\nLIV: This way, Doctor, we’ve got to take the elevator.\nLIV: BUTTON PUSHED. DOORS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: Which floor? Ah, of course, the one with the orange light.\nDOORS: CLOSE. WE ARE INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. ELEVATOR DESCENDS.\nDOORS: Going down. Gentlemen’s trousers.\nLIV: So... who do you think this Elicien is?\nDOCTOR: A member of the crew?\nLIV: I’ve never heard of him. Mind you, I didn’t really know everyone on board. You mean, you think Farel’s got a partner in all this? I didn’t think psychopaths worked in teams.\nDOCTOR: He’s not a psychopath. He’s a robophobic... although, I grant you, the two conditions do have many similarities.\nLIV: Maybe it’s a code name for someone.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nDOCTOR: Who are you calling?\nLIV: Cravnet? Cravnet.. can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: You think it could be Cravnet?\nLIV: You said you thought he was robophobic.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Liv? Is that you?\nLIV: Oh... yes. How... er... how are you feeling?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Dizzy. What the hell did you give me?\nLIV: (WHISPERS) He doesn’t sound like a psychopath.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPERS) He isn’t.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT]\nCRAVNET: Hello? I can’t hear you. Did you say something about a\nCRAVNET: psychopath?\nLIV: Never mind that. Do you know anyone on board called Elicien?\nELEVATOR: STOPS. DOORS OPEN.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Eh? Who?\nDOCTOR: Come on. This way, Liv.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THEY START TO MOVE OFF. CORRIDOR AGAIN. WE HEAR THE PULSING OF THE ORANGE LIGHTS AGAIN. THEY ARE BOTH RUNNING.\nLIV: Left up ahead.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] What are you doing? What’s going on?\nMUTE: BUTTON BLEEPS.\nLIV: (TO THE DOCTOR) I’ve got him on ‘mute’ this time.\nDOCTOR: Well done.\nDOCTOR: Page 128\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 129\nLIV: Should I just risk it and tell him the truth?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Hello? Are you still there?\nDOCTOR: The truth is always the best policy in my experience... well, almost always... except when it really gets you into trouble.\nLIV: Oh thanks.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Hello?\nDOCTOR: But since we’ve got less than an hour...\nLIV: Right. Okay. (BLEEP ‘UNMUTE’) Look, Cravnet—\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Yes? What?\nLIV: You know how it turned out that the robots weren’t trying to kill us?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Er.. yeah, but didn’t they kill Farel—?\nLIV: No, they didn’t kill Farel.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Oh. How do you know that?\nLIV: Because he faked his own death.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Did he? Why?\nLIV: Because he was the murderer. Turns out he did it dressed up as a robot.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] You’re kiddin’?\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 130\nLIV: With less than an hour to go before we smash into Ventalis and blow up, no I am not kidding, Cravnet!\nDOCTOR: Mr Cravnet! Check the crew manifest for anyone called Elicien.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Why?\nLIV: Because we think that’s the name of the person Farel is working with, and he’s currently about to jump ship without giving us the release codes for the ship’s navigation.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] I’1ll start looking. ‘Elicien’, you say?\nLIV AND DOCTOR: Yes!\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] How do you spell that?\nCRAVNET: DESPERATION.\nCRAVNET: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nDOOR: BUZZES AND HISSES OPEN.\nFOOTSTEPS: CLANK ACROSS METAL.\nFOOTSTEPS: A CODE IS ENTERED ON A CODE PAD.

WE\nFOLLOW: THEM AS THEY RUN.\nLIV: How far now?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea. Ask your captain.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nLIV: Captain?!?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Are you there yet?\nLIV: No. We’ve just passed intersection 70J-4. How close are we?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] If you keep running, it should take you another five or ten minutes.\nDOCTOR: And how long until the ship hits Ventalis?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Er.. about twenty-five minutes.\nLIV: Oh... great.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] I’ve got the robots helping me with the navigation controls.\nDOCTOR: Any luck?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT]\nSELERAT: Well, they’ve unlocked all the peripheral control functions, but the main navigation controls are still locked by whatever Farel’s secret code is. They’re trying aS Many permutations as they can think of.. which is quite a lot actually.\nSELERAT: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 133\nDOCTOR: My guess is that it’ll be something deeply personal, tied up with the reasons for his robophobia.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Oh... well the robots are hardly going to guess that, are they?\nDOCTOR: Hope springs eternal, Captain.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Very comforting.\nLIV: Another elevator. Come on!\nLIV: THEY COME TO A HALT, GASPING. BUTTON PRESSED. NOTHING HAPPENS.\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter?\nLIV: The elevator’s not working. Captain?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Elevator 70K-2?\nLIV: Er... where... ? Ah, yes!\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Oh. Out of service, I’m afraid.\nLIV: No!\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] But there’s a service ladder shaft to your right. It’s\nSELERAT: only five decks down.\nLIV: Oh... brilliant.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 134\nSERENE: MUSIC CROSS-FADES FROM FOREGROUND TO PIPING OUT OF SPEAKERS.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nFAREL: (FONDLY, CLOSE) Elicien.

Cravnet.\nDOCTOR: Have you come up with anything?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] There’s no one called Elicien in the\nLIV: (FRUSTRATED) Oh... no.\nCRAVNET: thank you very much.\nCRAVNET: than that.\nCRAVNET: crew.\nCRAVNET: But... get this.. I took a look at Farel’s personal files.\nLIV: And?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] And Elicien is the name of his wife.\nLIV: He’s got his wife on board?\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY KNOWING EVERYTHING) Of course!\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 136\nSERENE: MUSIC PLAYING.\nDOOR: HISSES OPEN.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nFAREL: Stay back! (GUN POWERS UP) Stay back or I’1l shoot!\nDOCTOR: I am staying back.\nFAREL: How did you open that hatch?\nDOCTOR: Oh... I’m very good with doors. Rudimentary code system. Pity you didn’t use anything so simple when you locked the navigational controls of this ship.\nFAREL: Get back and close the hatch or I’11 kill you.\nDOCTOR: Well, since you’ve made sure we’re all going to get blown up anyway, I’m afraid that isn’t much of an incentive.\nFAREL: I’m not bluffing.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you’re not. I’ll go then. Oh, but before I do... I’d like to have a word with Elicien, please.\nDOCTOR: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR: THE SERENE MUSIC IS AUDIBLE IN THE DISTANCE.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] What’s he doing?\nLIV: Sssh... keep your voice down.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] (WHISPERS) Sorry.\nLIV: He’s managed to get the door open, but it sounds like\nLIV: Farel’s got a gun.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Is.. is that music?\nLIV: Yeah. It is. It’s kind of beautiful, isn’t it?\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] I’ve heard it before.\nLIV: Cravnet? When?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT]\nCRAVNET: At night, mostly, coming from his office.

Get out.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think she’1ll want to speak to me. In fact, I know she will.\nFAREL: She won’t speak to you.\nDOCTOR: She will.\nFAREL: Shut up! (PAUSE) What makes you think she’1ll speak to you?\nDOCTOR: We have something in common, you see.\nFAREL: What? What do you mean? You’ve got nothing in common with her. She’s my wife. She won’t speak to you. She won’t speak to any of you!\nDOCTOR: Who killed Tal Karus?\nFAREL: What? A robot.\nDOCTOR: Who killed deputy Leebar?\nFAREL: Robots killed him.\nDOCTOR: And the pilot too?\nFAREL: Yes! And all the others! The engineering crew.

I...\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 139\nDOCTOR: (COAXING) Come on, Chief... don’t you remember?\nFAREL: You... you were... were with Tal, in his cabin.\nDOCTOR: That’s right. And what happened?\nFAREL: A robot killed him.\nDOCTOR: Then what?\nFAREL: It killed you! The robot killed you!\nDOCTOR: And that’s what I have in common with your wife.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right. Pass me the comms unit. Let me speak to her.\nCOMMS: BLEEP. Thank you. (TO ‘ELICIEN’) Nice music by the way, Elicien. (‘LISTENS’ TO HER). Ah, I thought so. (TO FAREL) She says\nCOMMS: it was her favourite tune.\nFAREL: (BEGINS TO SOB) Yes. We played it at the funeral.\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 140\nLIV: (HUSHED) This is crazy.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] (HUSHED) What’s crazy?\nLIV: (HUSHED) The Doctor’s talking to Farel’s wife, but—\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] (HUSHED) Hang on... I’ve just been looking at his files again, to get some sort clue... Elicien, his wife, she’s—\nLIV: (HUSHED) Dead. Yeah. I know.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 141\nDOCTOR: She says she wants you to stop all this. She wants you to give us the code to unlock the navigation controls.\nFAREL: No!\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter. She’s telling me the code now.\nFAREL: She can’t.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nFAREL: I.. I never told her.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but you see.. She can guess. You must know that.\nFAREL: (IN PAIN) No!!! Please, no!\nDOCTOR: And anyway, I think you did tell her. And when you told her, it was the most important thing you’d ever said to her.\nFAREL: (SCREAMS ) Noooooo!\nHIS: SCREAM REVERBERATES WILDLY. THE RUSHING OF A TERRIBLE\nSAND: STORM CROSS-FADES INTO IT. THE SERENE MUSIC SURGES...\nSAND: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 142\nSAND: 75. FAREL’S FLASHBACK/LIFEBOAT.\nSAND: THE SAND STORM SOUNDS BECOMING MUFFLED BY THE RUMBLING OF A SANDMINER’S ENGINES.\nSAND: AN ALARM IS SOUNDING.\nFAREL: (DESPERATE) Get out of there now, Elicien! Get out of there!\nFAREL: voc: [DISTORT] There is a control circuit malfunction, Chief Farel.\nELICIEN: [DISTORT] Terel! The scoop vents are locked open!\nFAREL: I know, Elicien. I know, that’s why you’ve got to get out there! There’s a sand storm on the way!\nVOC: [DISTORT] The bulkhead exits are jammed.\nFAREL: Then break them down!\nFAREL: voc: [DISTORT] We are not strong enough to break them down.\nFAREL: Of course you’re strong enough! What’s the matter with you? You’re robots!\nFAREL: VoC: [DISTORT]\nFAREL: We cannot. They are built to higher tolerances. But we will protect your wife as best we can. We will forma barrier around her with our bodies.\nFAREL: That’s not going to work.\nELICIEN: [DISTORT] It’s the best they can do, Terel. They’re trying their best to protect me.\nELICIEN: THE SAND STORM IS RISING TO A TERRIBLE PITCH ON DISTORT.\nFAREL: Elicien!\nFAREL: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 143\nELICIEN: [DISTORT]\nELICIEN: The sand storm is coming, Terel! I can’t hear you! If you can hear me, remember what we always say! Remember that, my love!\nELICIEN: THE SAND STORM REACHES A TERRIBLE PITCH.\nELICIEN: [DISTORT]\nSTATIC: BREAKS UP. SILENCE.\nSTATIC: AS FAREL SPEAKS, THE BACKGROUND FX CROSS-FADE TO THE\nFAREL: (SOFTLY) I love you today. And all the other days.\nDOCTOR: (WITH GREAT SINCERITY) I’m sorry, Farel.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 144\nLIV: (DETERMINED) Captain... The code is ‘I love you today. And all the other days’.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] Is that with spaces? Any idea of the punctuation?\nLIV: How long have we got?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT]\nSELERAT: Er.. just over fifteen minutes before we reach Ventalis orbit.\nLIV: Then you’ve got time to try every permutation. Give it to a robot to input.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: (CALLING OUT) Doctor, everything all right in there?\nDOCTOR: (IN DISTANCE) You can come in now.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 145\nSERENE: MUSIC IS STILL PLAYING.\nSLOW: FOOTSTEPS AS LIV ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) We'd better take him to your sickbay, in case he has a change of heart.\nLIV: (QUIETLY) I got the code to the captain. The robots are inputting it now.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Captain?\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT]\nCRAVNET: No, it’s me.. Cravnet! Listen, I’ve just found out how\nCRAVNET: Farel’s wife died.\nLIV: It’s all right, Cravnet, it doesn’t matter—\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT]\nCRAVNET: (BLURTING IT OUT) She was ripped to pieces by a sandstorm. Robots said they’d protect her... tried to, apparently, but it was no good—\nLIV: Yes, all right, Cravnet! That’s enough!\nCRAVNET: [DISTORT] Eh? Sorry, I was just trying—\nCOMMS: BLEEP, AS SHE CUTS HIM OFF.\nLIV: Sorry... Farel. Sorry.\nLIV: Why am I apologizing? He’s a murderer.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 146\nDOCTOR: Yes. He is. He lost himself. He couldn’t accept there was no one to blame for his wife’s death. So he blamed the only creatures who really tried to save her. The robots.\nLIV: Doesn’t make me feel any better... knowing why he did it. Why he killed my friends. I mean, what’s to stop me using all this, everything that’s happened today, as a reason for me to become a murderer now?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Liv. What’s to stop you? Are you going to become a murderer?\nLIV: No.\nDOCTOR: We’re all different. That’s one of the few certainties I’ve ever come across.\nLIV: How did you know, Doctor? About the code?\nDOCTOR: Hm? Oh... I guessed.\nLIV: (FLABBERGHASTED) Wh— ? You... You guessed?\nDOCTOR: I’ve encountered Grimwade’s Syndrome before. I knew the trauma that triggered his robophobia would’ve had something to do with robots. And when he was speaking to a wife who wasn’t on board, I guessed that trauma might have been her death.\nLIV: Do you make a lot of guesses like that?\nDOCTOR: Well... even the things we think are facts often turn out not to be true. So, estimating something without sufficient information to be sure you’re correct, isn’t as risky as you’d think... if you look at it that way. And besides, I’ve been watching human beings for a very long time.\nLIV: Have you now? Right, Farel, come on. You’d better come with us to the med centre.\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 147\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: (HUFFS) I swear, I’1ll swing for that Cravnet.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Look, Cravnet—!\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] It’s Selerat.\nLIV: Oh.\nDOCTOR: Have you input the code, Captain?\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] We did. And it worked.\nLIV: (HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF) Oh, fantastic!\nDOCTOR: Well done, Captain.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT]\nSELERAT: (IN A RUSH) The only trouble is... the velocity controls have overheated and fused. And at this speed, any course alteration would simply endanger other planets and shipping in the system. Basically, whatever we do, we’re going to crash into something.\nLIV: Please say you’re joking.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] What? Of course I’m not joking! What kind of stupid joke would that be?\nDOCTOR: Captain, you’ve got to abandon ship now. Get down here to the lifeboat. Liv, call Cravnet and tell him to get down here too.\nSELERAT: [DISTORT] But I’1ll never get down there in time! We’ve only got—\nDOCTOR: Run, Captain! Run! I’1l try to give you all the time I can.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 148\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nLIV: You will? How? What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: I’ve got a plan, but it’s very risky, so it’s best I do\nDOCTOR: it on my own.\nLIV: Is it based on guessing again?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. The most important thing is that you live, Liv. Oh... nice name, by the way. Good-bye!\nDOCTOR: HE DASHES OFF.\nLIV: Oh. But. Oh.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Cravnet! Don’t speak, just get down here now!\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 149\nTARDIS: MATERIALIZES.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOCTOR: Hello. How are things?\nDOCTOR: voc: What are you doing here? All humans are attempting to evacuate the ship.\nDOCTOR: I’m not human. And as to what I’m doing here... Well, I’m breaking a few tiny rules.. a bit. Just a bit. When did the captain leave?\nDOCTOR: voc: A moment ago.\nDOCTOR: Ah, good, right, at least I’ve bought myself some time.\nDOCTOR: voc: What time?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know, popped into the TARDIS, eased back a few minutes... just a few.. so as not to risk getting lost three centuries away. Well, I did get lost three centuries away, but I found my way back. The TARDIS can be a bit temperamental. Why am I telling you this? Why am I always explaining? I really must stop trying to explain things. For all I know, I might be wrong. I hope I’m not, but I might be. You never know, do you? And anyway, I’m wasting time.\nDOCTOR: Voc: I do not understand.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THE DOCTOR STRIDES FORWARD.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t matter! Right... this is the navigational section\nDOCTOR: here, isn’t it?\nCOMMS: BLEEP\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 150\nVENTALIS CONTROL: [DISTORT]\nVENTALIS CONTROL: This is Ventalis control to cargo ship Lorelei. You are approaching our planet at an unsafe speed. Please decelerate immediately.\nDOCTOR: Can we talk to them? Reassure them?\nDOCTOR: voc: The comms controls are jammed.\nDOCTOR: Never mind then. Now, my plan is this... Even though we can’t alter the velocity and slow ourselves down, we can alter course... And the only thing we can hit without causing damage to anyone except ourselves is—\nDOCTOR: voc: The Ventalis Sun. We have already set the course.\nDOCTOR: You... ? You’ve already set it? I didn’t arrive earlier and tell you to do that, did I?\nCOMMS: BLEEP\nVENTALIS CONTROL: [DISTORT]\nVENTALIS CONTROL: Cargo ship Lorelei. This is Ventalis control. [CONTINUES\nUNDER: DOCTOR AND VOC DIALOGUE] I repeat... You are approaching our planet at an unsafe speed. If you do not alter course or decelerate immediately, we will be forced to attack and destroy your ship.\nUNDER: Voc:\nUNDER: We will sling-shot the ship around Ventalis, using the planet’s gravity. The ship will then be propelled directly into the heart of the Ventalis Sun.\nDOCTOR: That’s what I was going to do. And the course alteration will give everybody time to get away in the lifeboat.\nDOCTOR: voc: This will be the best way to serve the humans.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nDOCTOR: Liv, are you all aboard yet?\nLIV: [DISTORT] Doctor, where are you?\nLIV: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 151\nDOCTOR: On the bridge.\nLIV: [DISTORT] But you can’t be! You’ve only just left. How did you manage that?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s a very short story.\nLIV: [DISTORT] Listen, Doctor, Cravnet’s nearly here, but I don’t think the captain’s going to make it in time.\nDOCTOR: Yes he is. Wait for him. I told you, I’m buying you some extra time.\nLIV: [DISTORT] But how?\nDOCTOR: Robot, activate that course now.\nCONTROLS: BLEEP. A RUMBLE OF ENGINES.\nCONTROLS: voc: Course now activated.\nLIV: [DISTORT] What have you done?\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t me. It was the robots. They’re protecting you. They have your best interests at heart. Remember to tell everyone that when you get to Ventalis. Remember to tell them that the robots saved your lives.\nLIV: [DISTORT] Um, I think you had something to do with it as well, though.\nDOCTOR: Oooh, not much really. I just wanted to make sure that one man’s tragedy didn’t destroy an entire civilization.\nLIV: [DISTORT] Er.. well, that’s... that’s very nice of you, Doctor. But what exactly are you going to—?\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nCOMMS: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 152\nDOCTOR: Sorry. No time. (TO THE ROBOT) How long until impact with the sun?\nDOCTOR: voc: Impact in.. One hour.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s plenty of time for quite a few of you to get into my TARDIS and escape.\nDOCTOR: voc:\nDOCTOR: There is no need, Doctor. Our destruction does not matter. Other robots will always be manufactured. We must stay here and make sure this ship does not cause any damage to other space traffic.\nDOCTOR: You know, this culture is very lucky to share its existence with creatures as selfless as you.\nDOCTOR: voc: It is merely our programming.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we’re all programmed in some way or other. But will you do me one last favour?\nDOCTOR: voc: Of course.\nDOCTOR: That planet out there has already received one message from a robot today... but it was false. Will you send them a truthful message?\nVOC: What message?\nDOCTOR: A message explaining everything. Access Farel’s personnel file. Access Tal’s database on Robophobia. Then you’1l be able to tell the whole story. The real story.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Who: Robophobia by Nicholas Briggs Page 153\nRACING: FOOTSTEPS AS SELERAT DASHES IN.\nSELERAT: (PANTING, OUT OF BREATH) Made it!\nDOOR: HISSES SHUT.\nLIV: Right, everyone in?\nCRAVNET: Yeah. Hatch sealed.\nSELERAT: (TOTALLY OUT OF BREATH) Yes... just about... I thought I’d run out of time. How the hell—?\nLIV: Listen!\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nVENTALIS CONTROL: [DISTORT]\nVENTALIS CONTROL: This is Ventalis control. We are monitoring your course alteration. You are now clearing our orbit, Lorelei, but we must warn you that you are heading straight for the sun. You must correct your course immediately.\nCOMMS: BLEEP.\nSELERAT: Who did that? The Doctor?\nLIV: The Doctor... the robots... A bit of both, I think. Cravnet, let’s not waste any more time. Launch.\nCRAVNET: You got it.\nCONTROLS: OPERATED. LAUNCH ALARM SOUNDS. Brace yourselves!
