I came here once before. With Zoe and... and you.\nJAMIE: With me? Sorry, Doctor, but you must be mistaken. I think I’d remember coming here. It’s not exactly a sight you see everyday, now is it? A great big blank. A white mist. It’s more like something out of a book!\nJAMIE: (FX: A STRANGE WHIRRING, RIPPING SOUND GRADUALLY APPROACHES\nTHROUGH THE MIST. OVER THIS: )\nDOCTOR: That’s exactly what this is, Jamie. But not just one book. Any book. All books.\nJAMIE: (IS THE DOCTOR MAD?) Oh aye. Is that a fact?\nDOCTOR: It’s about the only fact you’ll find here. This is a land where fiction is king.\nJAMIE: Doctor. Something’s coming out of the mist. People, by the looks of it. People in armour.\nDOCTOR: Not people, Jamie, no: robots. (THE NOISE STOPS) White Robots.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 1: EXT. THE VOID (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: (FX: 4 x WHITE ROBOTS’ NOISE AGAIN, AS IF IN NEUTRAL — OR IN\nCONFERENCE: )\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Quite a welcoming committee, aren’t they, Jamie?\nJAMIE: (HUSHED) What are they, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 3\nDOCTOR: Robots, Jamie. Mechanical puppets.\nJAMIE: Puppets without strings?\nDOCTOR: Oh, they have strings all right. Invisible ones, pulled by (ALOUD, SO ‘MASTER’ CAN HEAR) a very imaginative puppet master!\nJAMIE: And you’ve met this fellow before?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. These White Robots look a little more advanced than when we — when I — was last here. I suspect that, like them, the Master has been upgraded.\nJAMIE: And he’s the man who turned Myra and John and Nemo into paper?\nDOCTOR: If I’m right, Jamie, then Myra and John and Nemo never really existed — just fictional characters from this Land of Fiction. It’s a trap, Jamie, and we walked straight into it.\nJAMIE: Why?\nDOCTOR: Why did we walk in or why is it a trap?\nJAMIE: Either.\nDOCTOR: Someone wants us here. Someone wants us back. That’s why we were pulled out of our rightful place in time and brought here.\nJAMIE: This Master person?\nDOCTOR: Most likely. Nemo was sent to fetch us, remember. Presumably he was working for the Master. And that’s whom these White Robots have been sent to take us to. (TO THE ROBOTS) All right, Robots: take us to your Master! (NOTHING) I said —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 4\nJAMIE: Maybe they’re not the welcoming committee. Maybe they’re the execution squad.\nDOCTOR: No, Jamie. Whoever brought us here did so for a reason. If they meant to harm us they could have done so already, by any one of a thousand different means. This place brings creatures from the imagination to life — and not necessarily good ones.\nJAMIE: Then I’11l try not to think of any.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, it’s not your imagination at work here. Whoever runs this place, they remember other people’s creations. Never allowed to invent their own characters, they merely come up with new adventures for existing ones. I wonder what he’s like, this new Master. The last chap was rather [endearing —]\nJAMIE: Hey, Doctor, I think they want us to go with them.\nDOCTOR: I think you’re right.

(BEAT) Run!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 2: EXT. THE VOID\nJAMIE: (CATCHING BREATH) Have we lost them-?\nDOCTOR: I think so. For now.\nJAMIE: Hey — is it me, or has it got brighter?\nDOCTOR: It’s you. It’s not brighter; it’s not dimmer. It’s not anything. We only see it as being white because —\nJAMIE: Because that’s what it is.\nDOCTOR: Jamie. My TARDIS looks like a blue police box. It isn’t, though. In the same way this place looks like a white void. Which reminds me: I wonder where they put the old girl? The last we saw of her, she was in the hold of the Titan.\nJAMIE: (BARELY FOLLOWING ALL THIS) You mean we’re inside someone’s TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: No. Come on.\nJAMIE: Come on where?\nDOCTOR: This way.\nJAMIE: What do you mean “This way”? It could take us into the middle of nowhere.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, this is the middle of nowhere. Any direction we chose will take us further from here. It’s like standing on the North Pole. Any direction you walk in has to be South. (WALKING) Come on.\nJAMIE: Where?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 6\nDOCTOR: (POINTEDLY) This way!\nJAMIE: Och, alright — (FOLLOWS)\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: EXT. THE VOID\nJAMIE: (WALKING) Hey, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) What?\nJAMIE: (WALKING) Why do our feet make noises when we’re walking on nothing?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) You really do ask the most peculiar questions\nDOCTOR: sometime.\nJAMIE: (STOPPING) I was just trying to make [conversation] —\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY HUSHED) Shhh!\nJAMIE: (HUSHED) What is it?\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) I don’t know. You were making conversation over it.\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) There! That’s it!\nJAMIE: The drums... the fife...\nDOCTOR: Look! Over there!\nJAMIE: Redcoats! (RETRIEVING DIRK) Och, well, if they want a fight —\nDOCTOR: Jamie, put that knife away this instant. Those aren’t real Redcoats.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, real enough to feel the point of my [dirk —]\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR: Look again.\nJAMIE: They’re wooden-! Wooden Redcoats!\nDOCTOR: Toys, Jamie. Propelled by clockwork keys.\nJAMIE: Aye, but life-size! (FX: CREAKING STOPS) Hey, they’ve stopped. Have they seen us?\nDOCTOR: Don’t move. It could be that their sensors respond only to movement.\nJAMIE: Eh-? What d’you mean, ‘sensors’-?\nDOCTOR: The pieces in their caps — (FX: CREAKING RESUMES, SOLDIERS APPROACHING) Too late. They’re coming this way.\nJAMIE: I know. When you say “Run” —\nDOCTOR: On three, then.\nJAMIE: Right.\nDOCTOR: Three! (RUNS)\nJAMIE: What?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Come on, Jamie!\nJAMIE: You didn’t say [“run” —] (ALARM) Doctor, look out! Behind you!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. Three more of them. Other way, Jamie-!\nJAMIE: I’1l not leave you!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: For heaven’s sake, run-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: EXT. THE VOID\nDOCTOR: (FX: ECHO) Jamie..! (FX: BIGGER ECHO) Where are you? (FX: EVEN\nBIGGER: ECHO) Jamie...! (TO SELF) Oh, this is hopeless, I can’t\nBIGGER: see more than three feet in this mist. (LOUDLY, TO UNSEEN ‘MASTER’) Trying to split us up, are you, ‘Master’? Is that your game, divide and conquer? Well, it won’t work. Do you hear me, wherever you are-? Who-ever you are-? If you’ve something to say to me, I wish you’d come on and say it-!!!\nARTFUL DODGER: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Hello.\nDOCTOR: At last.\nARTFUL DODGER: I said, [“Hello” —]\nDOCTOR: (TURNING) Hello. And might I enquire just what you think you’re [playing at —] (BREAKS OFF, SURPRISED) Oh.\nARTFUL DODGER: (WALKING FORWARD) Thank goodness for that. This far out from the gateway you see all sorts of phantasmagoria. Trouble is, half the time they don’t see you back.\nDOCTOR: Young man, I may be many things, but a phantasm is not one of them.\nARTFUL DODGER: Then what are you?\nDOCTOR: “What?” I am not a “What”, I ama “Who”.\nARTFUL DODGER: My apologies, sir. To who [sic] do I owe the pleasure?\nDOCTOR: I am known as the Doctor.\nARTFUL DODGER: Then I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. What are you doing out here, Doctor? The Void is a bad place to be at any time, especially now.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: I’m looking for my friend. We became separated.\nARTFUL DODGER: That makes two of us.\nDOCTOR: And you are?\nARTFUL DODGER: Sergeant Jack Dawkins, Esquire. Better known to friends and enemies alike as —\nDOCTOR: . the Artful Dodger?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: EXT. THE VOID/INT. BEHIND DOOR\nJAMIE: (FX: ECHO) Doctor..! (FX: BIGGER ECHO) Where are you? (FX: EVEN\nBIGGER: ECHO) Doctor..! (TO SELF) Och, this is hopeless, I can’t\nBIGGER: see more than three feet in this mist. How’m I ever going to find my way out of this [place-?]\nJAMIE: What’s this? A door? (ALOUD) So I ask for something and then it appears, is that it? Alright then — (CLEARS THROAT) A\nJAMIE: bottle of whisky, and a lassie with a cheeky smile! (BEAT; TO SELF) No? Och well, always worth a try —\nJAMIE: (ALOUD) Och, I’m not going in there, it’s pitch dark! Could be anything in there. A three-headed, five-eyed, bloodthirsty beastie. And his big brother! (BEAT; TO SELF) But what’s the choice? Stay here forever, or chance it. Alright then, Jamie boy — here goes...\nJAMIE: (ALOUD) Right then, I’m in. Hey, is it too much to ask for a candle-? —\nZOE: (FAINT, FAR DISTANT, AND MUFFLED THROUGH SPACE HELMET) Jamie,\nZOE: no! It’s a trap!\nJAMIE: What was that-? (BEAT) Hello-? Hello, is there someone there?\nJAMIE: (RUSHING OVER) Och, no — the door! (STOPS, BEAT) Hey, but\nJAMIE: there’s nothing here. No door, no nothing.\nJAMIE: (FX: MECHANICAL CLUNKING, RUMBLING BENEATH — A TRAP DOOR OPENING)\nJAMIE: (SLOWLY) Door... ‘Trap’... (REALISATION) Trap [doooo0o00o0or! I]\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: EXT. THE VOID\nDOCTOR: Forgive me if this sounds odd, but you are the Artful Dodger?\nARTFUL DODGER: I am the what Artful Dodger?\nDOCTOR: Pickpocket, Fagin, Oliver Twist, that Artful Dodger.\nARTFUL DODGER: You seem like a remarkably well-informed gentleman, sir.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I am. It’s just, you’re not quite how Mr D[ickens] — (STOPS, CORRECTS HIMSELF) .. I mean, how I imagined you.\nARTFUL DODGER: And how did you imagine me?\nDOCTOR: Younger, for one thing —\nARTFUL DODGER: I was twenty-three last birthday —\nDOCTOR: . and whereas the top hat and turned-up coat is all as expected, you’re not usually depicted as carrying a very advanced laser cannon of some kind.\nARTFUL DODGER: (FX: KA-CHUNK) Locked and loaded! Can’t be too careful.\nDOCTOR: No. Tell me, what year is this? To you, I mean.\nARTFUL DODGER: The year, sir? Well, given that we’re stood outside the normal parameters of time and space, I’m not sure that’s a meaningful measure. We may be following a by-and-large standard linear narrative, but out here continuity is distinctly malleable.\nDOCTOR: I must have read Oliver Twist half-a-dozen times or more, but I don’t recall the Artful Dodger ever using that sort of language.\nARTFUL DODGER: I’ve travelled. Broadens the mind, you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: So I believe. So how did you end up here, Dodger? Wandering around the void like this?\nARTFUL DODGER: Long range scouting patrol. Trying to detect enemy movements. Oliver and me, we came through together — but we was attacked, and got separated.\nDOCTOR: Attacked, yes. That weapon of yours. May I take a closer look at it?\nARTFUL DODGER: You may not.\nDOCTOR: I can assure you I mean you no harm.\nARTFUL DODGER: That’s because you haven’t got a great big gun.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but — it doesn’t fit with your time period, does it?\nARTFUL DODGER: And again he talks of “time”. No, it’s not from my “time”. You expect me to come out here with an antiquated weapon, given the threat level?\nDOCTOR: Ah, but it wouldn’t be antiquated to you, would it? To you, a breech-loading Enfield rifle would be contemporary. State of the art.\nARTFUL DOCDGER: And completely useless. Here, look. And no, you may not touch. (FX: EJECTS CARTRIDGE — CLUNK) High velocity round, with an armour-piercing tip, see? The shell contains a cocktail of radioactive metals, held in an acetone suspension.\nDOCTOR: In a what-?\nARTFUL DODGER: (CHANGING SUBJECT) You’re worried about your friend, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Jamie. Yes. Will you help me find him?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 15\nARTFUL DODGER: I’ll give it a go. With any luck, he and Oliver will have found each other, and we can all stop worrying. You armed?\nDOCTOR: No.\nARTFUL DODGER: Shame.\nDOCTOR: I’ve never thought so. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE\nJAMIE: (COMING ROUND) Och, my head. I’m getting too old for this. Still — (GETTING TO FEET) Nothing broken, at least. (CALLING\nJAMIE: OUT) Hello? Anyone there?\nJAMIE: (TO SELF) No answer. Aye, well — (WALKING) .. best foot forward. Least it’s a change from all that white. If I follow the passage around —\nJAMIE: Oh. It’s you lot again, is it?\nJAMIE: Alright, alright, you’ve got me. Just don’t get to shooting, you ken? It’s not like I’m going anywhere, is it?\nJAMIE: Can’t speak, eh? Or won’t?\nJAMIE: I’m coming, I’m coming. (TO SELF) Oh, Doctor. Where are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT. THE VOID\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) It seems things have changed since last I was here.\nARTFUL DODGER: (WALKING) You’re outside time. You’re here, so you’ve always been here.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I most certainly have not!\nARTFUL DODGER: (WALKING) Just saying.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I am a Time Lord. I don’t need to be lectured on temporal tautologies by some penny dreadful pedant.\nARTFUL DODGER: (STOPS) They’re all dead.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Who are?\nARTFUL DODGER: The Penny Dreadfuls. Rough sorts, fought in the first campaign with Todd’s irregulars. This was early on in the war. Enemy agent got in the camp one night and poisoned their gin.\nDOCTOR: “Early on”? “First”? You said time had no meaning here.\nARTFUL DODGER: Not here in the Void, no. But the battle took place inside.\nDOCTOR: . Inside the Land of Fiction, you mean?\nARTFUL DODGER: Precisely. The Void is just the nothing that surrounds it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I remember. The last time I was here, we were led a merry dance all around the Void, until we arrived in the Land of Fiction itself.\nARTFUL DODGER: And the White Robots shepherded you through, I suppose?\nDOCTOR: Shepherded? You make me sound like a sheep!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 18\nARTFUL DODGER: Herded, then.\nDOCTOR: No. That’s actually worse.\nARTFUL DODGER: (SIGHS) Ushered. Thing is, if they catch you now, they’1ll take you somewhere far worse.\nDOCTOR: The last time — and don’t interrupt — the last time I was here, the White Robots didn’t want anyone harmed. I presume they obey the will of your new Master-?\nARTFUL DODGER: (SCOFFING) Master? You really are behind the times, aren’t you? There’s no Master anymore. This place is run by the Mistress.\nDOCTOR: The Mistress? And why not? Female writers are frequently more inventive than their male counterparts. The Mistress of the Land of Fiction.\nARTFUL DODGER: Yes, and in answer to your previous question: no, they don’t obey the will of the Mistress. We’ve been fighting them for as long as we can remember.\nDOCTOR: You mean — they’re your enemy? The White Robots?\nARTFUL DODGER: Them, and them who’s behind them. They’re not from here, see?\nDOCTOR: What, they’re not f[ictional-?]\nARTFUL DODGER: Fictional? It’s alright, you can say it. Some folks find it mightily offensive to be reminded of the fact, but not me. No. They came from outside, put here by whichever idiot built the computer that runs the place. And no, I’ve no idea who that was.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nARTFUL DODGER: No, you don’t. You’re just saying that to fool yourself you’re in control of the situation. You’re as confused as anyone.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: Tell me about this war.\nARTFUL DODGER: We’re losing. The Mistress assembled great armies to hold them back. But our enemy grows. As our troops fall, they swell the ranks of the enemy, converted almost at once.\nDOCTOR: They’re what?\nARTFUL DODGER: Plagiarised, killed, won over. Look, Mister — we can’t stand here expositing, not when the Void is crawling with the enemy. There’s a gateway not far from here. We can use it to access the Land.\nDOCTOR: We could, but I’m not leaving my friend.\nARTFUL DODGER: He'll be making his own way.\nDOCTOR: How? He’s as blind as I am here. I will not leave him lost and alone!\nARTFUL DODGER: Oh I doubt he’s lost, Doctor. And besides, who said anything about him being alone?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE\nJAMIE: (WALKING) I once had an uncle Duncan. Loving father, fierce warrior and the greatest piper in Scotland. The most boring man in the world. Now I’ve met you lot, I realise what an interesting fellow he was. Are you not going to say [anything? ]\nJAMIE: Och. You want us to stop, [do you-?]\nJAMIE: (FX: SOUND OF FIFE AND DRUMS IN THE DISTANCE. CLOCKWORK\nSOLDIERS: CLANKING)\nJAMIE: Oh, I see. More of your wee Redcoat pals, is it?\nJAMIE: (CALLING OUT, ENGLISH ACCENT) Halloa there! Shall we toast the King?\nJAMIE: Alright, I was only having a wee joke. No need to go pointing your muskets at us, is there now-?\nZOE: (OFF, BEHIND SOLDIERS; MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) Jamie! Get down-!\nJAMIE: Hey, who’s that at the back [there-?]\nZOE: (OFF, BEHIND SOLDIERS; MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) Just do it, Jamie. Please-!\nJAMIE: Well, if I [must-]\nJAMIE: (FX: VOLLEY OF MUSKETS. THE WHITE ROBOTS EXPLODE, WHIRRING\nWINDING: DOWN)\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 21\nJAMIE: Well — what d’you lot go and kill them for? They weren’t hurtin’ anyone —\nZOE: (APPROACHING; MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) Not yet, they weren’t!\nJAMIE: (AMUSED) Oh, look. A wee feller with a bowl on his head.\nZOE: (MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) What? Oh, the helmet. Hang on, I’1ll take it off. (BEAT, EFFORT) Sorry, it’s a bit stuck. Could you give me a hand?\nJAMIE: Why don’t you get one of your solider boys to help you?\nZOE: (MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) Oh, just do it would you? There’s a clip at the back.\nJAMIE: Alright. — Let’s see now.\nZOE: (MUFFLED, THROUGH SPACE HELMET) The helmet’s not strictly necessary, but it makes a useful bit of armour —\nJAMIE: Just hold still a second —\nJAMIE: Aye, that’s got it.\nZOE: (BREATHING IN FRESH AIR) Oh yes, that’s much better. Hello Jamie! It’s me! It’s Zoe!\nJAMIE: (NAME MEANS NOTHING TO HIM) .. ‘Zoe’?\nZOE: (GUSHING) Don’t mind the clockwork soldiers, they’re my friends. They’ve been helping me, ever since I arrived in this awful place. Oh Jamie, I can’t believe it! It’s only been a month, but it feels like years! Oh, give me a hug —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 22\nJAMIE: (HUGGED, A BIT NONPLUSSED) Hey, steady on —\nZOE: (BREAKING OFF) Oh, Jamie — it’s so good to see you again! Gosh, haven’t you got old?\nJAMIE: I’m in the prime of my life, I’1ll have you know!\nZOE: Oh dear. You don’t remember me, do you-?\nJAMIE: Hold on there. (SUDDENLY LEAPS TO WRONG CONCLUSION) Aye! Aye, I know who you are now —\nZOE: Well, thank goodness for that —\nJAMTE: Aye, I asked for you! “A lassie with a cheeky smile”. See, it worked!\nZOE: Oh, no —\nJAMIE: (CONFIDENTIALLY) Have you brought me some whiskey?\nZOE: Certainly not! Really, you have no idea who I am?\nJAMIE: I’m sure I’d remember.\nZOE: I thought this might happen. Here.\nJAMIE: What’s this?\nZOE: What does it look like?\nJAMIE: Looks like an apple.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 23\nZOE: It’s a data retrieval cluster. You hold it to your head.\nJAMIE: Why would I hold an apple to my head?\nZOE: To help unlock your memory. Oh, just do it, will you?\nJAMIE: I will not. I know my Bible. Sensible men getting led astray by lassies with apples.\nZOE: Your name is James Robert McCrimmon. Piper of the Clan McCrimmon. You fought at the Battle of Culloden. After that, you joined the crew of the TARDIS, and travelled with them through [time and space —]\nJAMIE: Och, you’ve been talking to the Doctor-!\nZOE: I haven’t. Honestly. Look — it’s all true, I promise you!\nJAMIE: It’s crazy talk! I mean, the Doctor’s no loon, but all that stuff — well, he’s got me mixed up with someone else, that’s what I’ve been thinking —\nZOE: Oh, just do it, would you? (COQUETTISHLY) Please? For the sake of a cheeky smile-?\nJAMIE: Aye, well, now there’s a reason. (TAKES APPLE) So — what, you want me to hold it to my forehead here, like this-?\nZOE: That’s right.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, I don’t see anything happening.\nZOE: Just give it a moment. For the synapses to [engage-]\nZOE: (FX: PSYCHEDELIC HUM BEGINS, RISING PROGRESSIVELY IN INTENSITY\nTHROUGH: )\nJAMIE: (GIGGLES) Hey, there’s like a tickling. In my head —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 24\nZOE: I know. The next bit’s not so nice, I’m afraid —\nJAMIE: Ah. Ah, that — that hurts a little now...\nZOE: Those are your locked memories coming in.\nJAMIE: Well I don’t like it! Stop it!\nZOE: First in a trickle. Then in a flood. (FX: HOLD, ECHO ON ‘FLOOD’ )\nJAMIE: (FX: COMING IN THROUGH THE HUM, SOUNDS FROM JAMIE’S ORIGINAL\nTRAVELS WITH THE DOCTOR: THE TARDIS TAKING OFF; DALEK GUNS;\nQUARK: WARBLES; YETI ROARS; ICE WARRIOR GUN...

Daleks and Ice Warriors and Quarks.\nJAMIE: Quarks, aye. But it wasn’t all bad. I had — friends. Sailor Ben. Beanpole Polly, his duchess. Victoria, precious like china. Then there was —\nZOE: . yes?\nJAMIE: . then there was Zoe. Clever little Zoe. Just the same as you always were.\nZOE: Oh, Jamie —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 25\nJAMIE: What the Doctor said... it was true. All of it. I’ve seen such wonders! I’ve walked on the moon. I’ve watched Atlantis sink beneath the waves. I’ve been to the other side of space and back again. And everywhere we went, there were monsters. (BEAT) Och, this is too much. My head!\nZOE: It’s alright, Jamie, really it is. I don’t know what’s happened to you, but you’1ll soon be your old self again.\nJAMIE: The Doctor! We were with the Doctor. Small and scruffy, he was, with a funny little gleam in his eye. And then —\nZOE: . then the Time Lords caught up with us.\nJAMIE: Aye, and sent us home. I woke up in the heather, in Scotland, thinkin’ I must have been knocked cold for a moment. But I remember it now. All of it. Aye, and I’ve been here before. In this place — the Land of Fiction! Och, Zoe, we’ve got to find the Doctor —\nZOE: In a moment. You’ve still not said why it is you’re so old? Is it some kind of time distortion?\nJAMIE: Will you stop that? I’m not old. I’m older, thank you very much, because I’ve lived a full and fruitful life. It’s only been a month, you said? For me, it’s been more like thirty years.\nZOE: Oh Jamie! I’m so sorry.\nJAMIE: Why? I’ve had a good life. Mostly. And if you think I’ve changed, just wait until you see the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT. THE VOID\nDOCTOR: So now what?\nARTFUL DODGER: You can’t see it, but there’s a gateway, a few hundred feet north of here.\nDOCTOR: How can this place have a north?\nARTFUL DODGER: It doesn’t. It’s a convention I’m using to explain unreal geography. I was trained to navigate my way about in here.\nDOCTOR: The Artful Dodger was a Victorian street urchin pickpocket. He was not, in any version of the story, an inter-dimensional secret agent who prowls alternate realities hunting robots! Care to explain?\nARTFUL DODGER: The Mistress gave us free will when she arrived. Most of us have risen to the challenge. True, there are some who’ve been hardened by conflict, become as cruel as the enemy we fight.\nDOCTOR: What the Dickens is going on here?\nARTFUL DODGER: Oi! Do you mind?\nDOCTOR: An unfortunate turn of phrase. I apologise.\nARTFUL DODGER: None of this is the fault of the Mistress, Doctor. She was not born to fight wars. She is gentle and kind, and this conflict breaks her heart. (BEAT) Does that — displease you?\nDOCTOR: Far from it, I think your Mistress sounds rather wonderful. So — the clockwork soldiers Jamie and I encountered. I take it they’ve gone over to this ‘enemy’, too?\nARTFUL DODGER: No! No, they’re ours. Or they should be. Fictional constructs, front line of defence.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR: They tried to kill us!\nARTFUL DODGER: More like they were trying to warn you. You were in a part of the Void riddled with traps.\nDOCTOR: Well, what if Jamie walked into one?\nARTFUL DODGER: Then he’1ll have been catapulted elsewhere. Figuratively speaking, I mean. But the soldiers will have gone after him, to protect him from the White Robots. The Mistress uses all manner of fanciful creations.\nDOCTOR: You know, I would very much like to meet this Mistress.\nARTFUL DODGER: And so you shall. But first we must find your friend. (WALKING) Northwards!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE\nJAMIE: You’re sure you can trust these soldiers of yours, Zoe?\nZOE: They did just save your life.\nJAMIE: Mebbe. But do they have to look like Redcoats?\nZOE: (SIGHS) Come on, Jamie.\nJAMIE: Where are they leading us? I don’t understand how this place has tunnels anyway.\nZOE: It doesn’t. The enemy have extruded parts of their lair into the Void.\nJAMIE: What, they live in these tunnels?\nZOE: Not exactly. These are the cellars of Castle Frankenstein.\nJAMIE: Castle who-?\nZOE: The soldiers will find the way out, I promise. After all, they found you.\nJAMIE: You mean, they were looking for me?\nZOE: Well, yes. We came out here to find you. You, and the Doctor, of course. Do come on, Jamie!\nJAMIE: Not so fast, hey? I’m not as — (STOPS SHORT OF SAYING ‘YOUNG’ )\nZOE: Not as what?\nJAMIE: Nothing. Come on, let’s go. Try and keep up, eh?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 29\nZOE: (EXCITEDLY) Look! Up there. Daylight.\nJAMIE: Or something like daylight.\nZOE: Come on. Let’s see what’s out there!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. THE VOID\nARTFUL DODGER: Here we are, Doctor. The Gateway to the Land of Fiction.\nDOCTOR: I don’t see anything.\nARTFUL: DODGER. Hello? We’ve got company.\nDOCTOR: Your clockwork soldiers!\nARTFUL DODGER: They’ve homed in on us. And they’re not alone!\nJAMIE: (OFF, APPR) Doctor! There you are! Look Zoe, we found him!\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) I don’t believe it. Zoe-?!?\nZOE: (RUNNING UP) You said he’d changed, but I had no idea he’d be so different! Oh Doctor, it’s so good to see you! Come here, I want a hug from you, too —\nJAMIE: (SUPPRESSING SNIGGER) Er, Zoe —\nZOE: (DREAMY) Just a minute, Jamie —\nDOCTOR: (CLEARS THROAT) Ahem-? It’s good to see you too, Zoe, but perhaps you would care to stop hugging Sergeant Dawkins?\nARTFUL DODGER: I don’t mind.\nZOE: Sergeant-? (BREAKS OFF HUG) Oh, you beast-!\nARTFUL DODGER: (CHUCKLES) Sorry!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 31\nJAMIE: You watch it, whoever you are —\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Jamie. He’s a friend. (BEAT) Hello, Zoe.\nZOE: Doctor? Is it really you?\nDOCTOR: I have to ask the same of you.\nZOE: (A BIT HURT) Oh.\nJAMIE: It is her, Doctor. Really it is.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t know, Jamie. You wouldn’t remember.\nJAMIE: But I do. Doctor, I remember everything. You, me, the TARDIS. A sailor called Ben, and a beanpole called Polly —\nDOCTOR: You do remember-?\nJAMIE: Aye, thanks to Zoe here, and her ‘dayt-er ret-’\nZOE: ‘Data retrieval cluster’.\nJAMIE: Aye, that’s the one.\nZOE: It’s alright, Doctor. I remember everything too.\nDOCTOR: I think you’d better start at the beginning.\nARTFUL DODGER: Look sharp, we’ve got company!\nJAMIE: White Robots!\nZOE: Oh no-! They must have followed us through the tunnel-!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 32\nARTFUL DODGER: (TO SOLDIERS) Soldiers, assume square formation and prepare to fire. Doctor, take your friends and go!\nDOCTOR: What about you?\nARTFUL DODGER: I’1ll be fine. Please, Doctor! Straight ahead, through the gateway!\nZOE: He’s right. Doctor, we have to do as he says —\nARTFUL DODGER: Squad Fire!\nARTFUL DODGER: (FX: MUSKETS FIRING; WHITE ROBOTS RESPOND. FIGHT CONTINUES UNDER, THROUGH: )\nDOCTOR: We can’t just leave him!\nJAMIE: Aye, there’s dozens of those things!\nZOE: You don’t understand, either of you. You don’t know who the enemy really is —\nARTFUL DODGER: (OFF) Oliver! Oliver, it’s me, Dodger!\nDOCTOR: Oliver...? (SEES OLIVER) (MUSIC: CYBERMEN CUE?) Oh no.\nARTFUL DODGER: (OFF) (SHOCK) Oh, what have they done to you? Oliver, mate —\nZOE: Look at his chest, Doctor. His arms. The bars through his head. Don’t you see? This is why we were brought here. To fight — [them. ]\nJAMIE: . Them. Aye.\nARTFUL DODGER: Poor old Oliver. It ain’t right, what they’ve done to you!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING, BRISKLY) Come back, Dodger. It’s too late, he’s been part-converted.\nARTFUL DODGER: Oliver? Tell me it ain’t true. Tell me you’ve still got a smile for your old friend Artful —\nDOCTOR: Whatever he was before, that is no longer your friend!\nARTFUL DODGER: Talk to me, mate. How can I help you? What do you want-?\nCYBERNISED OLIVER: (SLOWLY) Please, sir. I want some more.\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS) He’s a Cyberman!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 34"

Hadn’t we better get going? Wherever it is we’re going, that is.\nDOCTOR: We need to find this ‘Mistress’. She, I suspect, is the one who brought us here.\nJAMIE: Yes, but what about yon Cybermen-? They won’t be far behind us, that’s for sure.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 39\nZOE: We won’t get anywhere without help. Look up, through the trees-?\nJAMTE: A castle, aye. (A THOUGHT) Not Castle Frankenstein-?\nDOCTOR: Castle Frankenstein-?\nJAMIE: Where the Cybermen are.\nDOCTOR: Is that so-?\nZOE: That’s not Castle Frankenstein, silly. That’s Camelot!\nDOCTOR: Of course it is.\nJAMIE: What, King Arthur? The Knights of the Round Table? All that-?\nZOE: King Arthur’s long dead. But we’ll find help there. I promise.\nJAMIE: (STEPPING FORWARD) Oh well, whatever you say —\nZOE: (STOPPING HIM) Just don’t wander off the path. Before you know, you’ll be in the Wild Woods, and they’re —\nJAMIE: . not so lovely?\nZOE: No.\nJAMIE: The path it is, then —\nDOCTOR: Just — one moment, Zoe. If you would.\nZOE: Yes, Doctor-?\nDOCTOR: I’m curious to know how it was you arrived here.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 40\nZOE: Oh! Well, it was a few weeks ago, I think. I was on the Wheel, and then I just sort of, woke up here.\nDOCTOR: Wearing a spacesuit-—?\nZOE: Well, yes. I didn’t know where I was at first, but they gave me a data cluster.\nDOCTOR: Who did?\nZOE: The fairies.\nJAMIE: You mean one of those magic apples?\nZOE: They’re not apples. But yes. It undid the locks the Time Lords put on my memory.\nDOCTOR: Which shouldn’t be possible.\nZOE: In the real world, perhaps. But out here?\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nZOE: The Mistress’s agents had failed to locate you. I was sent to see if I could do any better.\nJAMIE: You’ve met her then, this Mistress?\nZOE: Oh no. It’s not personal, though: no-one has. (BEAT; CHANGING SUBJECT) So tell me, Doctor. What happened to you? I mean, to make you look so different?\nJAMIE: Aye, that’s a good question-!\nDOCTOR: It’s a very long story.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 41\nZOE: Well, it’s a very long walk.\nDOCTOR: True.

You’ve been there, I suppose-?\nDOCTOR: No. It’s just I can’t quite believe the real thing had a flatscreen TV in the middle.\nZOE: Pictures from the war.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’s not going well. The Cybermen being here throws the natural order out of the window. The heroes of classic fiction were never written to provide effective opposition for half-human machine creatures. Their authors could never have imagined such things —\nALICE: (APPROACHING FROM DOOR) Well, they could. That’s the point.\nDRACULA: (DITTO) And, of course: some of the things they imagined were worse.\nDOCTOR: Lieutenant Liddell. (DISTASTE) What is this... creature doing with you-?\nALICE: Doctor, Jamie, Zoe: may I present my commanding officer, his Excellency [Count —]\nDRACULA: . Count Dracula. Welcome to Camelot.

A blood-drinking revenant!\nZOE: No he’s not. He’s a character from a book.\nALICE: We are in the same room, you know?\nZOE: Doctor, whatever’s got into you?\nDOCTOR: Suffice it to say there is history between his people and mine. Bad blood, you might say.\nJAMIE: Oh. A clan thing. I know all about that. If I ever get my hands on a Campbell, he’1ll know all about it after what they did to us at Bannockburn!\nALICE: The Count initially refused a commission. It was only when we lost Sherlock Holmes that we were able to persuade him to lead us.\nDOCTOR: An obvious choice. After all, he did lay waste to half of Europe.\nDRACULA: That was the historical Vlad Dracul. I am a fictional creation, loosely based on him. Those sins were never mine.\nDOCTOR: I met him, you know. Prince Wallachia. He was briefly engaged to a friend of mine, as a matter of fact —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 52\nZOE: (SOTTO) Stop name-dropping, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I never name drop: Saint Augustine taught me that.\nJAMIE: Can someone answer me a question-?\nDRACULA: I can try, man of Alba.\nJAMIE: If none of this is real, what are the Cybermen doing here? What do they want, with unreal folks like you?\nDOCTOR: A good question, Jamie! They are real Cybermen, I take it — ‘Count’?\nDRACULA: The Cybermen fell to land here — some time in the past. They have made war on us ever since.\nALICE: They want the Mistress. The Master Brain at the heart of the Land.\nJAMIE: You don’t see what I’m getting at. If the Land of Fiction is ruled over by Cybermen rather than this Mistress of yours, what of it? It’s not like they’re doing harm to anyone real, is it now?\nALICE: No, really. We do have feelings, you know.\nZOE: Because it’s not about the Mistress. It’s about the power she holds.\nJAMIE: Eh-?\nDOCTOR: The power of the master computer! That’s it!\nJAMIE: Well, I’m none the wiser.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: Think, Jamie, think. When we were here last, the Master Brain wanted to use our minds — well, my mind — to adjust the thoughts of all mankind. To make Man like a string of sausages. All the same!\nJAMIE: What have sausages to do with it?\nZOE: All the same. It wanted to make us all the same. Just like the Cybermen!\nDRACULA: They seek to destroy the human imagination.\nDOCTOR: . because once the imagination is destroyed, humanity itself is destroyed!\nJAMIE: Aye, but can this master computer do all that-?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t want to bet against it, would you-?\nDRACULA: That is why we fight, Doctor. Without the human imagination, we cannot exist. But the tide is turning against us.\nJAMIE: How-? I mean, you’ve got all the ghosties an’ ghoulies ever dreamed of on your side. How can you lose-?\nALICE: Early on in the war, the Cybermen attacked the Wild Woods. A whole village of woodcutters were turned into Cybermen. Which was fine, until the first full moon.\nDOCTOR: The Cybermen converted werewolves?\nALICE: It was horrible. Fur and plastic all over the place.\nJAMIE: And this put them off did it?\nDRACULA: On the contrary. It opened their minds to new possibilities in terms of Cyber-conversion.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 54\nALICE: The fairies suffered the worst. Plastic skin, wings made of tinfoil.\nZOE: I didn’t realize. Those poor creatures-!\nDRACULA: The Cybermen see us aS a resource, Doctor. Like timber. Or... oil.\nDOCTOR: Oil. Yes, I was hoping we’d get around to that.\nJAMIE: Oil? What’s that stuff got to do with it?\nDRACULA: Follow me, friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. CAMELOT (STAIRWELL)\nDRACULA: (OFF, LEADING) This way. Follow! Follow!\nJAMIE: (WALKING) Oil, Doctor? What, like the black water that Overlord was after, in the Highlands?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Only the black water wasn’t oil, Jamie. It was the exact same stuff that Nemo was harvesting from the giant squid of the North Atlantic. Ink.\nJAMIE: (WALKING) But it couldnae have been!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Remember what Nemo said? “The ink is all that stands between victory and defeat”?\nJAMIE: (WALKING) Think about it, Doctor. All that in the Highlands, and at Grangemouth. That was before we even arrived in the Land of Fiction.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Was it?\nALICE: (OFF) Doctor! We’re waiting!\nZOE: Stop gossiping, you two.

For ink!\nALICE: The well is used to store harvested ink.\nDRACULA: The blood of the Land.\nZOE: Literally.\nJAMIE: Och, you’ve lost me again.\nDOCTOR: Jamie — even a realm of the imagination needs substance and matter. We could hardly exist within its bounds otherwise.\nJAMIE: It’s still just words —\nZOE: Exactly. And what are words made of, on the page?\nJAMIE: . Och, I get it. Ink!\nDOCTOR: It’s like they say. Fact is always stranger than fiction. And the fact of this Land of Fiction is more peculiar than any flight of fancy I’ve heard. But there it is: the stuff of life, in this dimension. Melanin encaustum: ink!\nJAMIE: Aye, but what do you need the ink for? Making things? Weapons?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 57\nALICE: Yes.

After all — if you could generate an infinite number of characters, you’d have overwhelmed the Cybermen long ago.\nDRACULA: Although the Void itself is endless, the Land of Fiction itself is merely vast. It stretches away inwards, away from the border.\nALICE: (WALKING OVER) The ink is mined in far-distant realms, where the Mistress has little influence.\nDRACULA: Cut off from the heart of the Land, some of those have fallen prey to.. unsavoury characters. Thieves. Speculators.\nDOCTOR: Such as — the Hirudin Corporation, for example?\nALICE: You mean, the space leeches?\nJAMIE: Aye, that’s them —\nDRACULA: Refugees from the four-colour kingdom.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS) From comic books-?\nZOE: The point is, their ink supply has been interrupted, or cut off altogether. And all the time, the Cybermen are converting ever-greater numbers to their own side.\nDRACULA: Camelot is our last line of defence. Past this thin black line of ours, the Cybermen may access the heart of the Land, and the clifftop citadel of the Mistress. If they should break through...\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that-?\nALICE: Air attack warning.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that a little uncanny-?\nDRACULA: A small dramatic coincidence. It is how we live.

It’s like you don’t need [sleep-]\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED, A BIT SOTTO) Sssh, Jamie!\nJAMIE: Don’t ‘shush’ me. It’s not right, a man needs his kip —\nALICE: Yes, but we don’t want to wake her.\nJAMIE: Wake who?\nDOCTOR: Look. (MUSIC: ‘REVEAL’ STING) Sleeping Beauty.\nJAMIE: You’re having me on. — What, the Sleeping Beauty?\nALICE: No, they’re all over the Land. The Mistress uses them as relay stations, to help shore up a consistent reality. We use them for our communications network.\nDOCTOR: Very technologically minded, this Mistress of yours.\nJAMIE: Communications-? Hey, does that mean we can get a message to Zoe?\nDOCTOR: I was wondering the very same thing.\nALICE: I suppose — I could try to hack Beauty.\nDOCTOR: With a woodcutter’s axe, I suppose-? Joke. I was joking.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 76\nJAMIE: Hey, she’s even got a wee spindle here.\nALICE: Don’t touch that!

Alice, you’re bleeding.\nALICE: Well, obviously.\nDOCTOR: You’re bleeding ink.\nALICE: Again, obviously.\nJAMIE: Well, do all you storybook folk bleed ink?\nDOCTOR: They can’t do. We’d have noticed. (REALISATION) Except...\nALICE: Perception is everything here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it, though? Before yesterday, we perceived everyone we met here to be the same as us. But what we learned yesterday, in your ink well, in Camelot, changed all that. And so now we see things differently.\nALICE: You’re becoming ever more deeply involved in the story of the Land. That’s worrying.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 77\nJAMIE: Aye. If we’re real.\nDOCTOR: Jamie? What do you mean?\nJAMIE: Thing is, Doctor — I’ve got my memories back now. And I’m remembering last time. Seeing yon sleeping lassie made me remember. You were asleep, weren’t you? The last time we were here. I think Sleeping Beauty over there’s been left as a clue.\nDOCTOR: I don’t follow.\nJAMIE: Look. The Master, the man we rescued from here, all those years ago, we took him with us into the TARDIS, remember?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We took the Master with us into the TARDIS. (WORRY) But how...\nJAMIE: Aye, how did we get him home again?\nDOCTOR: Well, we... (BEAT) I can’t remember. Oh, it was three of my lifetimes ago! I can’t be expected to remember everything. We took him back to the TARDIS, and then...\nJAMIE: . and then suddenly we were back on Earth again. Fighting the Cybermen!\nDOCTOR: No. No. What happened was... I’d taken the TARDIS out of space- time altogether. We experienced hallucinations, a psychic attack. You and Zoe left the ship, and I fell asleep.\nJAMIE: Aye. You fell asleep.\nDOCTOR: I sat down in a chair and I... I fell asleep. Oh, Jamie. All this time. All those memories. Scarves, cricket, Bessie. All those times and places.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 78\nALICE: (DISTRACTED FROM WORK) I’m trying to hack into the system here-? And you two are giving me a headache! (SOTTO, TO\nSLEEPING: BEAUTY) Sleeping Beauty. Come in, please. I don’t want to have to kiss you. —\nDOCTOR: What if we never escaped? What if everything we’ve experienced Since... has been a dream?\nJAMIE: Aye. Our whole lives gone by, and all of them one long fantasy.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t our second visit here. We’re still in our first! We never left the Land of Fiction!\nALICE: (IRRITATED) Oh, this is nonsense. Look. I’1l prove you’re real. Give me your thumb —\nDOCTOR: No, wait — (PRICKED) Owwww!\nALICE: See? Not ink. Blood. Red blood.\nDOCTOR: It could be red ink.\nALICE: It could be strawberry jam! You’re real.\nJAMIE: (UNWRAPPING TOURNIQUET) So then how do you explain... this?\nDOCTOR: Explain what?\nJAMIE: See here, where I was caught by shrapnel? Blood. Black blood.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Jamie...\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 79\nJAMIE: Don’t you see, Doctor? You might be real. But I’m not.

A full life, fighting the English, doing my best by my brothers and sisters in the clan McCrimmon. Then you come along, and you tell me about this whole other life I’ve forgotten. A strange, mad life, fighting monsters among the stars. And no sooner have I got my head around all that, than I find out this — that I’m, I don’t know, a figment of someone else’s imagination-?\nALICE: It’s not all bad, you know.\nJAMIE: Och, you just keep your nose out, lassie!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: Jamie, Alice is our friend —\nJAMIE: Aye, well.

This is a difficult moment for all of us, but right now, I think we should concentrate our minds on finding Zoe.\nJAMIE: Aye, and this “Mistress”. Cos there are one or two things I'd like to say to her, as well!\nDOCTOR: Alice. No joy with establishing a radio link?\nALICE: Not with Beauty here. The network’s overloaded, it looks like she’s crashed. There was a base station at Camelot, I wonder fe I\nJAMIE: (CUTTING IN) So where to now?\nALICE: I’m guessing Dracula will have taken Zoe east of Camelot. The only way back down to the coast from there is over the Borgo\nALICE: Pass, on the fringes of his own domain. That’s where they’1l\nALICE: be heading.\nDOCTOR: The Borgo Pass-?!? But that’s in Transylvania!\nALICE: You’re thinking real world topography. The other side of the Pass is only a few miles further on.

ENGLISH RIVERBANK/TRANSYLVANIAN MOUNTAINS\nALICE: (EXAGGERATED NICENESS) I still dream of that day. The air was thick with the scent of meadow-sweet. I lay by the riverbank, breathing in the summer. I’d lost my sunhat, and sought the shade of a leafy willow. My eyes were so heavy, the grass as soft as silk.\nDRACULA: Winter came early in Transylvania that year. One night the clouds cleared and I stood on the snow, bathed in moonlight, feeling the faint burn of the reflected sun on my skin, the memory of a warmth I had not felt for centuries. I cried the red tears of other men’s blood.\nALICE: I sank down into the warm grass, and fell into a deep sleep.\nDRACULA: I found the young woman lying by the frozen river. She had frost in her hair and on her lashes.\nALICE: Soon it was nightfall. I heard the gentle sounds of woodland creatures. The snuffle of hedgehogs, the distant hoot of an owl.\nDRACULA: She was wearing summer clothes, her throat exposed.\nDRACULA: (FX: CUT TO — FAIRYTALE MUSIC SOUNDS OF SUMMER. A DISCORDANT NOTE. A FLUTTER OF BATS CREEPING IN)\nALICE: The flutter of... bats?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 95\nDRACULA: Softly I knelt beside her in the snow. Her eyes snapped open.\nALICE: I looked up at the monster standing above me. “Dracula!” I whispered. “What on Earth do you think you’re doing?”\nDRACULA: I watched the jugular vein throbbing in her neck.\nALICE: Just then the White Rabbit popped his head out of a hole in the side of the riverbank and said:\nDOCTOR: Stop it, the pair of you. It’s the Cybermen, they’re playing with your perception of reality. They’re trying to force you into a story.\nDRACULA: I lowered my eyes in shame, repulsed by what I had become.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well, that’s vampirism for you. (EFFORT — CAN’T GET OUT) Just — come over here and help me out of this rabbit hole, would you? It’s a little snug.\nALICE: (APPR) “Hello, White Rabbit,” I said. “What are you doing stuck in there?”\nDOCTOR: Trying to get out!

Just forget they’re there, will you?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR: There. Come on, let’s go and find the others. Who knows what fun they’re having?\nDRACULA: I watched as the stranger and the girl turned towards the darkness.

THE MAGIC FOREST (CONTINUOUS)\nALICE: Stop it!\nDRACULA: Owww-! There is no need to hit me-!\nDOCTOR: Now focus, Count. We need to get back to the others.\nDRACULA: “I agreed, and so I turned towards —”\nALICE: No, you’re still doing it.\nDRACULA: sorry.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING OFF) Now come along-!\nALICE: Doctor. What I still don’t understand is — what do the Cybermen want with the Land of Fiction? With us-?\nDOCTOR: If they seize control of the central computer, they could reverse its polarity — use it not to amplify the human imagination, but to destroy it! Robbing humanity of the ability to invent stories, to tell lies — to exaggerate, even! Stripped of the power of imaginative thought, humankind would become soul-less, emotionless half-beings. Cybermen.\nDRACULA: Then it is just as well they have not yet located the Mistress.\nALICE: I — wonder.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nDRACULA: Lieutenant-?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 98\nALICE: They have control of the Mistress’ communications. I fear... I am very much afraid, that they will have used the network to triangulate the position of the Citadel.\nDRACULA: And only now you tell us-?\nALICE: I didn’t want to worry you unduly, General.\nDRACULA: Bah!!!\nDOCTOR: This isn’t good.

Have you got your responsible adult to make you a nice cup of synthimilk? Good. Now turn your unit down to gentle ambient, and we’ll begin. Ready, Sunny Star?\nZOE: Zoe woke up in a beautiful garden. She had no idea how she had got there, but it was the loveliest garden she had ever seen. “That’s because the flowers are all made of plastic,” she told herself. “They need never wither and die. They’re far more efficient that way.” Zoe loved the garden. Do you like pretty gardens, Sunny Star?\nZOE: Zoe was looking for her friend, Jamie the thistle fairy. The two friends had enjoyed many exciting adventures together. She loved travelling with him, although they did get into the most dreadful trouble. Only the other day they’d had to escape from an erupting volcano. Zoe had been very scared.\nZOE: “Hello Jamie,” said Zoe. “I’m going off to gather apples from the orchard. Would you like to help me?”\nZOE: “What sort of apples?” asked Jamie.\nZOE: “They’re data clusters,” said Zoe. “They store memories uploaded from organic life forms and hold them in stasis until their emotions can be removed. They’re delicious!”\nZOE: “That doesn’t sound very nice,” said Jamie. “In fact I doubt you could taste anything ever again! Especially once the Cybermen had cut out your olfactory sensors and replaced them\nZOE: with circuitry.”\nZOE: Zoe laughed. Her friend was so silly.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: “Come on, Jamie. Let’s go through into the orchard,” said Zoe, running through garden gate.

But if there is another me, somewhere in the real Scotland — I bet you never went back, did you? To see how he was gettin’ along-?\nDOCTOR: I was exiled, Jamie! A prisoner of the 20 century! I didn’t have my TARDIS — well, I did, but it wasn’t working —\nJAMIE: Got it working soon enough, though, didn’t you? What you told us earlier, about you living on Earth, driving around in your funny yellow car — Jamie could have been going through God alone knows what all the while! And you didn’t think, not once, to go and see if he was alright?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t, no.\nJAMIE: You left us, Doctor. Left us right in the middle of a war!

This doesn’t look at all good.\nJAMIE: Look! More of yon torpedoes!\nDOCTOR: Brace yourselves, again —\nDOCTOR: (FX: TORPEDOES HIT AGAIN. ALL STAGGER ABOUT AGAIN — INCLUDING SAILORS. EXULTANT CYBER-WHALESONG )\nZOE: The ship can’t take much more of this!\nALICE: Too late, they’ve breached the hull! We’re taking on water!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR: Lifeboats?\nZOE: This is a pirate ship, Doctor! They don’t do health and safety!\nALICE: We’re sinking!\nDOCTOR: I know that sound-! Where-?\nDOCTOR: (FX: AGAIN, AS PER ‘TITAN’: THE OCEAN BEGINS TO BUBBLE &\nSEETHE: AROUND THEM AS A VAST ARMOUR-PLATED SUBMARINE EMERGES FROM THE WATER)\nJAMTE: Doctor, look — there, in the water!\nZOE: What is it? Another whale?\nDOCTOR: No whale! You know, it might be a good idea if we were to duck. (SHOUTING) Take cover!\nDOCTOR: (FX: MOBY DICK HIT BY TORPEDOES. EXPLODES IN THE WATER. WHALE\nMEAT: RAINING DOWN INTO SEA, AND ONTO DECK OF HISPANIOLA)\nZOE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: An exploding whale.\nDOCTOR: (FX: A HATCH OPENS IN THE SUBMARINE CONNING TOWER & A FIGURE EMERGES ON DECK)\nJAMIE: Aye, and a welcome friend.\nNEMO: (SHOUTING, FROM OFF) Ahoy there, Doctor!\nJAMIE: The Nautilus!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING) Captain Nemo! Come to join the fight against the Cybermen-?\nNEMO: (SHOUTING, FROM OFF) It is as the Romans said, Doctor: “Nemo me impune lacessit.” No-one provokes me unpunished! (FX:\nANOTHER: PERSON CLAMBERING OUT ONTO NAUTILUS DECK) I’ve brought along an old friend, to aid you in your battle —\nROB ROY: (SHOUTING, FROM OFF) Thought you’d seen the last of me, didn’t you — Black Donald?\nJAMIE: (SHOUTING) Rob-?!?\nZOE: (SHOUTING) Who-?\nROB ROY: (SHOUTING, FROM OFF) The name’s MacGregor!

WET DOCK (THE NAUTILUS)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ATMOS AS PER WET DOCK SCENES IN ‘WRECK OF THE TITAN’. INSIDE THE NAUTILUS. ZOE CLIMBING DOWN LADDER)\nZOE: Oh, Captain — this ship of yours is amazing!\nNEMO: It is the perfection of vessels! And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself, you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once captain, builder, and engineer.\nJAMIE: (FX: OFF LADDER) Aye, and a bit of a bighead.\nROB ROY: Good to see you again, Donald, lad!\nJAMIE: You too, Rob!\nZOE: (FX: OFF LADDER) ‘Donald’?\nDOCTOR: Long story. (FX: OFF LADDER) (TO NEMO) Well, Captain — this is a turn-up for the books. Quite literally, in fact. Weren’t you Supposed to have turned your back on civilized society? According to your author, that is-?\nNEMO: What you fail to understand, Doctor, is the power of hate. It can fill the heart as surely as love.\nALICE: (FX: OFF LADDER) That’s a rather bleak philosophy.\nDOCTOR: You are working for the Mistress, though-?\nNEMO: I work in my own interest, Doctor. But at this time, the interests of both myself and the Mistress coincide. She requested I dredge a certain something up from the seabed, to aid you in your fight...?\nJAMIE: Not another of those giant squid things?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 114\nNEMO: No. Something much more valuable. Behind you-?\nZOE: Doctor, look! He’s got your TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe it-!\nNEMO: The box has gathered a number of barnacles, but it seems otherwise undamaged —\nDOCTOR: (FX: PATTING DOOR) Good to see you, old girl. Nemo? I need you to stay with the Nautilus. We’re expecting trouble. (FX:\nUNLOCKING: DOOR) Jamie, Zoe — with me.\nALICE: Doctor? Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: The Citadel. Obviously.\nALICE: Then I’m coming with you.\nROB ROY: Yes, and I.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, no. I need you both here with Nemo.\nALICE: Whatever for? If the Cybermen attack, you’ll be over-run! You need soldiers.\nROB ROY: Aye! Someone to watch your back.\nJAMIE: She’s got a point, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Against my better judgement —\nJAMIE: Excellent!\nROB ROY: (WALKING INTO TARDIS, OFF) Budge up, Donald, man. There can barely be room to swing a cat in h—\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 115\nALICE: (OFF) I say, it’s [bigger on the inside—]\nALICE: JAMIE and ZOE: (OFF) We know.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT.

Data points to submarine designated “Nautilus”.\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER:\nCYBERMAN: It is all that blocks our way to the Citadel.

C’mon. (THEY HEAD OFF)\nDOCTOR: Stay close to me, Zoe, Alice. If I remember right, the Control Centre proper was around about [here-]\nKARKUS: (GERMAN ACCENT) You shall not pass.\nZOE: Doctor! Look! It’s the Karkus-!\nALICE: The who-?\nDOCTOR: A comic strip character from the pages of the Hourly Telepress, if I recall.\nALICE: And I thought all the superheroes were dead.\nZOE: Hello, Karkus. Do you remember me? Your friend, Zoe?\nKARKUS: I — remember. You — follow.\nZOE: Doctor, Alice — you heard the Karkus.\nZOE: (FX: DOCTOR, ALICE, ZOE FOLLOWING KARKUS THROUGH INTO CONTROL\nCENTRE: PROPER.

He could teleport himself away, but here he stays. Loyal unto death.\nDOCTOR: The Mistress, I presume. If you turned on the lights, we’d be better able to see your face.\nMISTRESS: Doctor. At last. I knew you’d come. I never once doubted you. Not for a second. I knew you’d find me.\nZOE: Why is her voice so familiar?\nDOCTOR: (HARD) It’s alright, you can drop the pretence.\nMISTRESS: Zoe... doesn’t know.\nZOE: Know what?\nDOCTOR: You never told her?\nALICE: (IT’S BEGINNING TO DAWN ON HER) When she was asleep in the Magic Forest, it was like — she’d stopped. And then she was —\nDOCTOR: . rebooted?\nZOE: You make me sound like a machine.\nDOCTOR: (FX: WALKING ZOE FURTHER FORWARD) Look at her, Zoe. At the Mistress. Can’t you see? Haven’t you of all people worked it out yet?\nMISTRESS: I’ve been here all this time. Trying to hold them off. Trying to remember stories from my childhood, finding ways to fight them. All this time, waiting for you to find me... Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 119\nZOE: It can’t be —\nDOCTOR: It is.

I was remembering how we’d fought the Cybermen together, you, Jamie and I; how we’d driven them off the Wheel; how you and Jamie had got in your TARDIS and left. But as I watched your ship fade from view, the strangest feeling came over me. So I went for a medical, went to see Gemma Corwyn’s replacement. Do you know what he found?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR: Enlighten me.\nMISTRESS: I was two years older, medically speaking, than I’d been a few hours before. Well, I worked it out for myself. You’re a time traveller. I must have gone with you and been returned, my memories wiped.

I was outside, observing the remnants of Messier-13, when I saw the ship. A Cyberman raiding party. There was no time to warn anyone.\nMISTRESS: 54D: INT. CITADEL (CONTROL CENTRE)\nMISTRESS: There were three of them, and a Cyber-Planner. They began converting the crew at once. People I’d known for years. Leo Ryan, do you remember him? They got me when I was forced to come back in for air. They took me aboard their ship.\nZOE: Didn’t you try and fight them?\nMISTRESS: But I am fighting them!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: EXT.

It contains the sum of my studies of the sea, and the story of my life; and God willing, it will not perish with me.

And keep firing, until they’re dead. Or we are.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 132\nROB ROY: Then — let’s gi’em laldy!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: (LINKED SEQUENCE) 58A: INT. CYBERSHIP (FLASHBACK)\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nMISTRESS: Well, slight as I was, I wasn’t going to make much of a Cyberman, they could see that much. But they tested my intelligence, and decided that my brain would make me a fine Cyber-Planner. (BEAT) Which is rather flattering, actually.\nDOCTOR: Zoe, the human computer. Nothing changes.\nMISTRESS: As their probes dug into my consciousness, something budged. The mental blocks placed by the Time Lords fell off, and it all came flooding back. The TARDIS, our travels together, all those wonderful adventures. I remembered how the Time Lords had captured you, and had sent Jamie and I back to our own time.\nMISTRESS: 58B: INT. CITADEL (CONTROL CENTRE)\nZOE: Should I really be hearing this? I mean, won’t the Time Lords be awfully cross?\nDOCTOR: I think it’ll be alright, Zoe.\nDOCTOR: 58C: INT. CYBERSHIP (FLASHBACK)\nMISTRESS: I realised — if my mind was open to their systems, their systems were open to my mind. I calculated how to send a feedback wave to the Cybership — and took control of their propulsion systems, punching a hole in space-time, transporting them somewhere I knew they could do no more harm.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: So you brought them here.\nMISTRESS: The Cybership split in half as it crashed into the Void. The only advantage I had was that I knew where we were, and knew I had to reach the Control Centre. So I ran —\nMISTRESS: 58D: INT. CITADEL (CONTROL CENTRE)\nMISTRESS: . I ran here. Well, to what remained of here. The computer had been terribly damaged, but — well, I plugged myself in, and my consciousness did most of the work. The Land of Fiction unfolded around me.\nDOCTOR: And you’ve been fighting the Cybermen ever since?\nDOCTOR: MISTRESS.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Initially, I brought characters from stories to life, but the Cybermen could easily outwit them. All stories have a logic of their own, and Cybermen are good with logic. So I gave the characters free will. I made them cunning and unpredictable. Of course, that means some of them went mad in the process. Some of them became just cruel, or greedy.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We’ve met some of those. The space leeches-—?\nMISTRESS: Oh, them. Some of Karkus’s enemies, from the pages of the Hourly Telepress.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and that devil Merodach, too —\nMISTRESS: Merodach-? One moment —\nZOE: (READING) ‘Merodach’. Source: The Brownie of the Black Haggs. Author: Hogg, James. 1770-1835.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 135\nMISTRESS: Please, Doctor, don’t get the wrong impression. There was always more good than bad.\nZOE: Dodger and Oliver. Nemo and Rob Roy. Alice and Dracula.\nDOCTOR: But nonetheless — the Land of Fiction was by now a more dangerous place than ever?\nMISTRESS: Yes — even without the Cybermen on the march, converting all the beings they could find. I needed help. I needed someone who could put things right, and defeat the Cybermen. I needed you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And so — you re-created me?\nMISTRESS: Don’t think I didn’t try. I novelized all of our adventures.\nZOE: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Here they are, on the bookshelves, see?\nDOCTOR: (READING OFF TITLES) Doctor Who and the Dominators. Doctor Who and the Krotons. Doctor Who and the Laird of McCrimmon — I don’t remember that!\nMISTRESS: Well, I had to make some up of my own. Don’t worry, Doctor. It turns out you’re just too unlikely a character ever to be successfully recreated, even here.\nDOCTOR: One of a kind! Unique!\nMISTRESS: ‘Absurd’, the computer labelled you.\nZOE: So — the Doctor here’s the real thing?\nMISTRESS: Of course. I opened a small hole in space-time and sent a stream of data through, locked onto the TARDIS’ navigational circuits. I’m very, very clever, as you know.\nDOCTOR: So that’s how I landed up here!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 136\nMISTRESS: As ever, the TARDIS managed to scramble the data a little, you arrived way off target. So I created a friend for you, someone to keep you safe — and built an environment around him, somewhere he’d thrive.\nZOE: Jamie!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and literary Scotland.\nMISTRESS: I’d remembered him so well, every detail of him. I was a young girl, then, and he was so very pretty. I remembered him so well that when I re-created him, he took on a life of his own, almost at once. But in the absence of his memories of you, he created his own back story. A heroic past. It put years on him.\nDOCTOR: But you took away his memories of me because-?\nMISTRESS: To give you a mystery to solve. So you’d stick with him. So you’d stay. And to prevent him from inadvertently fictionalising you.\nZOE: Poor Jamie.\nMISTRESS: He deserved better, I know. The next thing I knew, there you were in the Atlantic —\nDOCTOR: . re-arranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. Literally.\nMISTRESS: You shouldn’t say that around here. It’s not a safe word.\nDOCTOR: So then you sent Nemo to find us-?\nMISTRESS: I'd set my best agents to search for you. And when, finally, I’d got you in the Void...\nZOE: You re-created me.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 137\nMISTRESS: I made you seconds before you bumped into Jamie. I thought I'd better give you and Jamie your memories back, to avoid any further complications.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think you’d complicated your plot quite enough.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN\nDOCTOR WHO: CYBER-PLANNER:\nDOCTOR WHO: Cyber-converted fictional life forms are suffering unacceptable losses. Cyber-converted magical creatures are still susceptible to magical attack. We must again warp the consensus reality.\nCYBERMAN: That will require a large expenditure of energy.\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER:\nCYBERMAN: Release control of the attacking force. The conservation of energy will be enough to power the device. In the confusion we will advance and conquer.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. CITADEL (CONTROL CENTRE)\nZOE: So.. I’m a fictional being?\nMISTRESS: I’m sorry, Zoe. You’ve every right to be angry.\nZOE: Angry? I think it’s a brilliant plan. Drag the Cybermen away from real time, trap them here in a war with people who don’t even exist, and wait for the Doctor. It’s genius. I’ma genius!\nDOCTOR: Except that the Cybermen saw other possibilities, didn’t they?\nZOE: What does that mean-?\nDOCTOR: & MISTRESS: Trouble!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: EXT.

Whatever happens, don’t let go of your rifle. Remember, none of this is real! Say it!\nROB ROY: That’s nonsense.

Perhaps I went mad and I imagined you.\nJAMIE: Perhaps. Because If I were imagining you I’d have imagined someone a wee bit prettier.\nROB ROY: Hey. I’m pretty! (SEEING ALICE) So’s she. Well hello there, lassie-!\nALICE: Cybermen. Behind you.\nALICE: 62B: NARRATION\nMISTRESS: Jamie pushed Alice out of harm’s way, grabbing a large two- handed sword, conveniently left for him in the grass. Rob Roy drew his own sword, and side by side the two friends hurled themselves at the enemy.

Seal all the doors!\nJAMIE: (BREATHLESS) Aye, there’s a Cybership outside. They’re landing!\nZOE: Er, Jamie —\nJAMIE: Aye, what is it-?\nZOE: There’s something small and silver and ugly, and it’s climbing up your kilt.\nJAMIE: Och, this is no time for practical joking-!\nROB ROY: She’s not joking, you know.\nJAMIE: Och, no. It’s a baby Cybermat! Get it off me, Rob —\nROB ROY: (EFFORT) It’s all sandy. It must have burrowed up through the beach —\nDOCTOR: No, no! Whatever you do, don’t kill it!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 145\nJAMIE: Now who’s joking-?\nDOCTOR: It’s not a Cybermat.\nALICE: It’s a datamat!\nDOCTOR: One of their so-called bookworms, exactly. Try to hold it still. Zoe?\nDOCTOR: MISTRESS and ZOE: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Just one of you, thank you. Real Zoe.\nDOCTOR: MISTRESS and ZOE: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Mistress Zoe-?\nZOE: Oh, sorry!\nDOCTOR: The Cybermen have been converting magical creatures. But if we could only make them fictional again —\nMISTRESS: Then I could write them out of existence! But I can’t just ‘unconvert’ magical creatures.\nDOCTOR: The bookworms, Zoe! The Cybermen used the bookworms to help them rewrite notional reality, correct-? What if we were able to do the same to them?\nALICE: Well? Is it possible-?\nZOE: It shouldn’t be that hard to rewrite its programming.\nDOCTOR: Not with two Zoes working on it, no! (ZOE AND MISTRESS WORK ON\nBOOKWORM THROUGH: ) The tricky bit is going to be getting it aboard their ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL)\nJAMIE: Aye, well — I’1l go.\nROB ROY: You’1l have to get past me first, man! I’1l go.\nALICE: Tweedledum and Tweedledee won’t know what they’re\nALICE: go.\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t asking for volunteers. I’m the one who’s\nMISTRESS: None of you will do it.\nDOCTOR: Well then, who-?\nMISTRESS: (FX: CLAPS HANDS TOGETHER) Karkus!\nJAMIE: Och, not that bonehead-!\nKARKUS: Mistress.\nMISTRESS: Karkus.

Where am I?\nDRACULA: Aboard the Cybership, awaiting Cyber-conversion.\nNEMO: I shall die first-!\nDRACULA: Believe me, it is over-rated.\nNEMO: Damn it, Count — where are you-?\nDRACULA: I am a mist.\nNEMO: Then resolve yourself, I’m not talking to mist-!\nDRACULA: Very well —\nNEMO: But — you are a Cyberman!\nNEMO: CYBER-DRACULA:\nNEMO: They tried to convert me. But they may convert living matter only, and I have not been alive for several hundred years. Now, I am nothing more than a ghost wearing a machine. (BEAT) I have removed your shackles. Can you still move?\nNEMO: (SITTING UP) I — yes. But where is my crew-?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 148 CYBER-DRACULA:\nDOCTOR WHO: Those who lived, are already converted.\nNEMO: Then — these Cybermen shall be made to pay!\nNEMO: CYBER-DRACULA:\nNEMO: Good Captain, I never expected anything less —\nNEMO: A Cyberman! — No. Not a Cyberman. What manner of being are you-?\nKARKUS: (FX: FOOTSTEPS TO HALT) I am Karkus. You are Nemo-?\nNEMO: I am, yes —\nKARKUS: Take radio. I have message for you.\nNEMO: (INTO RADIO) Hello-?

There is an entrance to the Castle inside the\nDOCTOR: ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: (D) They must have extruded it, like they did in the Void. Good. Now, listen very carefully —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: INT. CITADEL APPROACH\nJAMIE: Here they come. Ready for some more.\nALICE: Look out, Jamie! Coming up to your side-!\nCYBERMAN: Seize the Mistress unit —\nROB ROY: Not likely, laddie — (FX: FIRES)\nDOCTOR: (APROACHING DOWN STEPS) Jamie, Rob, Alice — there are too many of them. You’1l have to fall back.\nALICE: But then they’1l be inside the Citadel-!\nDOCTOR: We don’t need to hold them back much longer. Long enough for\nDOCTOR: Karkus to complete his mission, that’s all.\nROB ROY: Aye, well, I don’t need convincing.\nJAMIE: Reckon you’re right —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN\nCYBERMAN: 1: Report: Cybermen advancing into the Citadel.\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER: The humans cannot endure. The Central Computer will soon be ours.\nKARKUS: (RUNNING IN, FROM OFF) Karkus.. kill!\nCYBERMAN: 2: Alert. Intruder approaching —\nCYBERMAN: 1: Protect the Cyber-planner —\nKARKUS: (HIT) Karkus.. die now! But the world will hear from Karkus again..! (DIES)\nCYBERMAN: 1: Intruder destroyed.\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER: Resume normal operations. Cybermen will advance into Central Control — (GASPS, BURBLES SUDDENLY) What is — happening-?\nCYBERMAN: 1: Cyber-planner. Elaborate —\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER: There is someone — something — inside my consciousness!\nDRACULA: (ETHEREAL — IN MIST FORM) It is I. Count Dracula. You have converted me. Now, I shall convert you-!\nCYBERMAN: 1: There is no creature.\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER: (PAINED) There — is...\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 152\nCYBERMAN: CYBER-PLANNER: Cyberman. Protect me-!\nDRACULA: Even a Cyberman may not live with Nemo’s cutlass in its innards.\nNEMO: Foolish automaton, the Karkus was a diversion. (FX: BOOKWORM SOUND) Now. I must upload this ‘bookworm’.\nNEMO: CYBER-PLANNER: You are a fictional being. You do not have the intelligence to threaten the might of the Cybermen!\nNEMO: That is perhaps true, but we have had assistance.\nDRACULA: From a chronic argonaut known only as... the Doctor.\nDRACULA: CYBER-PLANNER:\nDRACULA: The.. Doctor? The Doctor lives, in the Land of Fiction-? (FX: TRANSMITTING) All Cyber-forces, alert! [Enemy being, the Doctor, reported to be at large in the Land of Fiction —]\nNEMO: Now, wherever shall I place this creature-? Oh yes. (EFFORT)\nNEMO: In — here!\nNEMO: CYBER-PLANNER:\nNEMO: CYBER-DRACULA?: It is done-?\nNEMO: I believe so —\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 153\nDOCTOR WHO: CYBER-PLANNER:\nDOCTOR WHO: (WEIRD GARGLING, IT’S BEEN TAKEN OVER BY BOOKWORM) All Cyber- forces. Alert. There is no such thing as Cybermen. Confirm: Cybermen do not exist-! Cybermen are nothing-! Cybermen do not exissssssst-!!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: INT. CITADEL (CORRIDOR)\nALICE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: I imagine that’s the Cybership winking out of existence. Look out of the window.\nJAMIE: They’re gone! All the Cybermen, gone-!\nDOCTOR: All the fictional Cybermen, the ones who’d been converted, are gone.\nZOE: Doctor, you did it!\nDOCTOR: Well, you did it. You and the other Zoe. I mean, obviously I was instrumental in enabling you to do it, but still —\nALICE: Doctor — what about Dracula?\nROB ROY: Aye, and Nemo?\nDOCTOR: They died bravely.\nZOE: The Karkus, too-?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nZOE: I was hoping for a happy ending.\nDOCTOR: Only in fiction —\nDOCTOR: (FX: CRAAASH! WALL CAVING IN. 4 x WHITE ROBOTS RIP, WHIRR\nTHROUGH: )\nJAMIE: Och, no-! White Robots!\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 155\nZOE: What are they doing here-?\nDOCTOR: This is it. This how the Cybermen mean to take over fiction. They needed the White Robots to do it for them. They’re a vital part of this place.\nALICE: But the Cybermen are dead-!\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, the Robots don’t know that. Yet.\nZOE: Well, they are rather stupid creatures. White Robots! Listen\nZOE: to me!\nJAMIE: Zoe, no. Stay back-! They’ve got Cyberguns now!\nZOE: The Cybermen are gone. Your masters are gone! —\nDOCTOR: Back into the Control Centre, all of you. Jamie, you too-!\nJAMIE: Doctor, they killed Zoe-!\nDOCTOR: No! The real Zoe is back here. Come on!\nDOCTOR: (FX: ALL RUN INTO CONTROL CENTRE AS WHITE ROBOTS WHIRR\nFORWARD: )\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: INT. CITADEL (CONTROL CENTRE)\nMISTRESS: Is it over, Doctor? Is our story ended?\nDOCTOR: It’s far from over. Alice, Rob — help me pile up those bookcases, we need to hold the Robots back.\nJAMIE: What’s the use, eh? Zoe’s dead. I’m dead. Not that I was ever alive in the first place.\nMISTRESS: I’m here, Jamie. I’m alive.\nJAMIE: The real Zoe was much prettier. I reckon you were so busy with your sums and your science that you didn’t notice. Poor Zoe.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well. If those Robots get in here, it won’t matter who’s real, or who’s not. (DECISIVELY) Zoe, I’m taking you back.\nMISTRESS: But — if you disconnect me, the Land will no longer exist.\nDOCTOR: Not if someone takes your place. Someone who belongs here. Someone like Jamie, perhaps-?\nJAMIE: Me? Master of the Land of Fiction-? Och, no fear, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Laird of the Land of Fiction.\nMISTRESS: The Laird of McCrimmon.\nJAMIE: Not for me. Ask Alice.\nDOCTOR: Alice-?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 157\nJAMIE: Of course Alice! She knows her way around all these machines. And she knows all these characters, too. Be honest, Doctor. All I’m good for is fightin’. (CALLING OFF) Alice! Got a wee job for you, hen-!\nALICE: I’m a little busy right now —\nROB ROY: Donald, man, we could use a hand-! These Robots won’t be contained-!\nJAMIE: Aye, I’m on it. This is me, Doctor. This is my destiny.\nDOCTOR: Very well. It was good to find you again, Jamie.\nJAMIE: Good? It’s been mad! I’m not the Jamie you knew, Doctor. But if you ever find yourself in the Highlands again — well, you know what to do.\nDOCTOR: I do. “Aye.”\nJAMIE: Och, c’mere, you —\nJAMIE: (BREAKING OFF) Aye, well, that’s quite enough of that. You won’t catch me actin’ like some kind of Frenchman —\nJAMIE: They’re in. The White Robots.\nDOCTOR: Alice! Back here, now!\nALICE: (RUSHING OVER) Alright, alright! — What is it?\nJAMIE: (RUNNING OVER) Rob Roy MacGregor!\nROB ROY: We gonna do this, Jamie, man?\nDOCTOR WHO: LEGEND OF THE CYBERMEN by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 158\nJAMIE: Aye. — You called me Jamie.\nROB ROY: So I did.\nJAMIE: Right, then. (FX: UNSHEATHING SWORD; LIKEWISE ROB) Let’s do ae\nJAMIE AND ROB ROY: Craig an tuire!\nJAMIE AND ROB ROY: (FX: WHITE ROBOTS’ WEAPONS FIRING. SLOW... TO FREEZE... AND ECHO. THE END OF ‘BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID’ )\nALICE: Jamie and Rob ran headlong at the White Robots. I never saw what happened next. For a long time, there was silence. And then, with the stain of the Cybermen wiped from its pages, the Land of Fiction began to grow again, becoming something quite, quite different. A Wonderland, with me as its Mistress. Its Queen of Hearts. But that’s another story.\nMISTRESS: The Doctor took me into his TARDIS, heading back towards the only other home I knew: The Wheel in Space. But as we left Fiction, the Time Lord conditioning fell on me once more, as I knew it would. And so the Doctor lay me gently on the floor where we'd first met, all those years ago. He kissed me gently on the forehead, and then — (DROWSY) .. and then...\nDOCTOR: . and then her memories shut down for the final time, and I\nDOCTOR: was lost to her again.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
