Crewman Donald Philpott, seen here waving to well-wishers, was chosen from _ over thirty recruits for the honour of being the first man to set foot on _ the Surface. At  a_ special reception, Crewman Philpott was presented to dignitaries from the Central Advisory Committee and got an_ extra special farewell from Ruby Craddock, this year's Miss Beetroot Factory. Whoops, steady on, Crewman. Better wipe that lipstick off your visor before’ the Missus_ sees. (Music swells’) And now we say God speed to you as you_ set off on Man's greatest endeavour... Fade as the music climaxes...\nCOMMENTATOR: 2. INSIDE CREWMAN PHILPOTT'S HELMET. We can hear the crewman's_ steady breathing as_ the MINISTER speaks to him from the other end of the phone line.\nMINISTER: Good _ evening, Mr — Crewman. I'm speaking to you, on behalf of the Central Committee, in what must be the strangest telephone call ever*. In moments you will step out of your capsule, the first man _ to set foot on the Surface since our tiny world began. Strengthened by _ the finest technology the _ science factories can muster, you carry our future in your hands - our light into the endless dark’ Good luck, Crewman. We are praying for you.\nMINISTER: Clunk of a_ phone being put down, followed by the _ dialling tone which fades. Philpott takes a deep breath, The buzz of a door opening. The enclosed sound vista opens out onto the wide, frozen surface of Mondas. A gentle moaning wind. Somehow we need to convey’ the absolute vastness of space around and above’ him.  Philpott's breathing quickens as he tries to take it in. He _ gives a_ single wailing scream and_ the perspective pulls back as it echoes across the landscape. *Direct quote from Nixon's message to Apollo u.\nMINISTER: 3. THE CITY - OUTSIDE THE PICTUREHOUSE. We are in a_ street of the underground city. But the place is deserted - no traffic, no people about. The DOCTOR and NYSSA are reading a poster.\nNYSSA: (Bemused) Battle From Above The Sky. See visitors from\nNYSSA: the stars. All Action Adventure. Thrilling. Astounding. Startling?\nDOCTOR: Sunday for seven days. Sounds suitably tawdry and\nDOCTOR: unrealistic. If we could find an usherette in the gloom, Nyssa, I'd buy you a strawberry mivwvie.\nNYSSA: I thought 'the pictures’ meant a sort of art gallery.\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. But it is an entertainment... of sorts.\nDOCTOR: He rattles the closed doors.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And this cinema must have been shut for years.\nNYSSAA: boarded-up picturehouse doesn't prove this is Earth.\nDOCTOR: (Uneasy) You know, I'm not sure coming here was such a\nDOCTOR: good idea.\nNYSSA: You didn't say much at all. Just that the coordinates\nNYSSA: weren't right. This isn't Earth is it...? (Beat) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Beat) Everything shuttered up. Not a soul on the street.\nNYSSA: Maybe there's a curfew. Or perhaps it's just late.\nDOCTOR: That clock said a quarter to eight. And the atmosphere's\nDOCTOR: stuffy. Like a hothouse. (Covering up) Yes. Yes, of course, it's Earth. We're right in the heart of London*. I just didn't recognise it under the _ street lights. Trafalgar Square is that way with the lighted tree. And _ that's’ the Palace beyond it. Must be Christmas.\nNYSSA: (Sternly) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Look, tram lines! Probably the nineteen-fifties.

Just another half an hour.\nNYSSA: I didn't say a word.\nDOCTOR: You go that way. I'll go this. But be careful. Just look.\nDOCTOR: Don't get involved.\nNYSSA: All right. (Going) Half an hour.

The last tram’s’ gone already. It can't’ be far off Lights-out.\nDAD: Not to worry. The patrols won't be out for ages yet.\nDAD: Creak of unsteady timbers. The Cybermat squeaks.\nYVONNE: Careful. You'll have the whole lot down.\nDAD: places the cheeser on the planks.\nDAD: Steady. It starts to hum.\nDAD: There now. (Backs off a bit) He can't resist that. I'll give\nDAD: him three minutes. Then we can be off home to tea. Got the _ net?*\nYVONNE: Yep.\nDAD: Good, lass. And here's the tongs.\nDAD: The Cybermat squeaks again.\nYVONNE: He's not budging.\nDAD: Give him time.\nDAD: Another Cybermat squeaks behind them.\nYVONNE: What's that?\nDAD: There's another blooming one behind us.

Push harder!\nNYSSA: (Struggling) I'm trying to.\nNYSSA: That's it. Come on, Dad. (Pulling him clear) Out you come.\nYVONNE: That's it. Come on, Dad. (Pulling him clear) Out you come.\nNYSSA: Please... hurry\nYVONNE: Nearly clear.\nNYSSA: gasps. The timber clatters sideways.\nYVONNE: Are you all right? Hello?\nYVONNE: Beat.\nNYSSA: (Coughing) Fine. Really. What about your father?\nYVONNE: Dad? Come on, please. (Beat) I don't know. He's not\nYVONNE: moving.\nNYSSA: (Moving in) Let's see. (Beat) He's not breathing.\nYVONNE: What are you doing?\nNYSSA: Just a second. I can't find his pulse. (Beat)\nYVONNE: I don't understand.\nNYSSA: (Gently) I'm sorry... Look, I don't even know your name.\nNYSSA: But your father... I don't think he's... well, he's not...\nDAD: Her name's Yvonne, lass.\nNYSSA: Oh!\nYVONNE: Dad!\nDAD: Gave us all a fright, that did. I'm a bit dusty, but still all in one piece.\nYVONNE: Are you sure?\nDAD: My arms’s a bit... No, course I'm fine. Now, who's your\nDAD: friend?\nNYSSA: I'm sorry. Your’ pulse.. I mean, I! thought you _ were...\nYVONNE: I really couldn't've got Dad out on my own. Thank you...\nYVONNE: erm...\nNYSSA: My name's Nyssa.\nDAD: (Laughing) Nyssa! Well, that's original. We're obliged to\nDAD: you, Nyssa. Oh lor’, look at the state of your lovely clothes. We'd best get you cleaned up.\nNYSSA: No. Really, I'm fine.\nDAD: Well, you can't have far to go, not so close to Lights-out.\nNYSSA: I'm not actually from around here, you see.\nNYSSA: Sound of distant claxons. Plink as the street lights go out.\nYVONNE: Lights-out. You'll never get home now.\nNYSSA: I can look after myself.\nDAD: (Laughs) With night patrols out? I reckon you'd best come\nDAD: back with us. It's the least we can do.\nNYSSA: Sorry, but I have to meet someone.\nYVONNE: It's not safe after Lights-out. No one goes out.\nDAD: Only blood-market spivs and civil servants.\nYVONNE: (Foreboding) And the Police.\nNYSSA: No, truly I have to meet...\nDAD: (Sharp) Now then. No arguing, young lady. It's back home\nDAD: quick as you can. And we'll see what's set for tea.\nDAD: 5. CITY STREET. The DOCTOR's solitary footsteps approach and stop.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) The Empress of China once had a great fright, She couldn't remember her left from her right... (Beat) Right,\nDOCTOR: I think... (Beat. Then reading) Tram stop. (Beat) Or maybe left. Ahhh... A shop door opens sounding its little bell.\nDODD: We're closed.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry. Just exploring.\nDODD: Well, you won't catch a tram to go \"exploring\" from\nDODD: around here at this time of the night. No more trams until the morning.°\nDOCTOR: Ah, well. I don't think I've ever travelled on a tram. I'm the Doctor by the way. How far does the city reach?\nDODD: (Very cagey) Doctor, eh? Public or... private? (He makes\nDODD: private’ sound deeply dubious)\nDOCTOR: That's between me and my clients.\nDODD: Private, then.\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. Is that a problem?\nDODD: We've a lot of doctors round here already.’ Where's your identity papers?\nDOCTOR: Sorry. Seem to have mislaid them.\nDODD: Or your ration book? Any family?®\nDOCTOR: Lost them too. Very careless.\nDODD: (Suddenly starts to chuckle) A doctorman. Yes, I like it.\nDODD: Clothes, hair, teeth, eyes. Very nice. Very... healthy. All your they?\nDOCTOR: _Just something I go about in.\nDODD: Outside and in?\nDOCTOR: Down to the last ligament. Strange. I heard artificial\nDOCTOR: organs were all the rage round here.\nDODD: (Annoyed) Newfangled Committee gadgetry.\nDOCTOR: (Sharp) Committee? So, there's no more demand for good old-fashioned, natural transplants.\nDOCTOR: DODDOh, you should see my waiting list. You ever thought ofa\nDOCTOR: new career as a donor, Doctor? It can be very\nDOCTOR: Is this your shop? (Reads) Thomas Dodd, purveyor and\nDOCTOR: fitter of mecessary bodily parts. Discounts negotiable. Perhaps take a look.\nDODD: (Worried) You a Health Inspector? You're certainly not Police.’\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Mr Dodd. Tell me about the City.\nDODD: (Suddenly chummy) Listen, Doctor. How's about a glass\nDODD: or three?’° We can have a nice little chat. Just us.\nDODD: 6. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT. Key in the front door. It opens to let in DAD, YVONNE and NYSSA.\nDAD: (Calling) We're home, lad. (To others) In you come, you two. Let's see what our Prank's got for tea.\nNYSSA: Thank you, but I really shouldn't...\nDAD: Oh, nonsense. Yvonne, take Nyssa through while I lock\nDAD: up.\nDAD: own, are\nDAD: I\nDAD: lucrative.\nDAD: should\nDAD: He starts throwing bolts and jingling chains.\nYVONNE: Through here, Nyssa.\nYVONNE: She opens the door to the parlour.\nYVONNE: Frank, we've got a visitor. Oh...\nCONSTANT: (Rather overbearing) Good evening, Yvonne.\nYVONNE: (Wary) Sister Constant. Hullo.\nYVONNE: FRANK The Sisterman's been waiting for hours. Where've you\nYVONNE: been?\nCONSTANT: Don't exaggerate Frank. I've been waiting fifty-six minutes.\nFRANK: Who's that?\nNYSSA: My name's Nyssa. Good evening.\nDAD: (Coming in) Nyssa missed her last tram home. We\nDAD: couldn't leave her out on the streets. You're out late, Sister.\nCONSTANT: Just on my _ rounds. (To NYSSA) Do I know_ you, dear?\nNYSSA: I don't think so.\nDAD: Nyssa's down from the South district. Not under your\nDAD: jurisprudence up there, is she?\nCONSTANT: Regrettably not. How are you, Yvonne? Still employed at\nCONSTANT: the hydroponic culture plant?\nYVONNE: Yes, thank you, Sister.\nCONSTANT: Good. And is the medication working?\nYVONNE: Yes, thanks.\nCONSTANT: No side effects?\nYVONNE: Nope. Not much.\nFRANK: Apart from being Dad's favourite.\nDAD: Frank!\nDAD: CONSTANT And you, Mr _ Hartley? How are you_ since’ the _ cardio- ectomy?\nDAD: Well, normal mostly. Sometimes I can feel the Uttle\nDAD: paddles going round in the chest unit.\nCONSTANT: That's normal.\nDAD: Like being wired up to a blooming accordion. I'll give you\nDAD: a tune if you like.\nCONSTANT: You seem to be holding your arm awkwardly.\nDAD: Just pulled it a bit. Ow! (Winces)\nYVONNE: Dad, you didn't say.\nCONSTANT: Perhaps we should take a look.\nDAD: (Defensive) Oh, no. I know what that means. My arm's\nDAD: fine. And I neither want nor can afford a new one.\nCONSTANT: As_ you_ like. (To NYSSA) And you, young’ lady? Nyssa what exactly?\nNYSSA: Nyssa of Traken.\nCONSTANT: = O'Traken. That's unusual. There's an O'Brien’ family in the West district. May I see your papers?\nNYSSA: (Prim) In the South, where I come from, we accept people\nNYSSA: on trust. Mr Hartley has generously extended his hospitality to me. But I don't answer to_ strangers, especially public servant busybodies like you.\nDAD: lets out a phew of disbelief:\nCONSTANT: (Very frosty) I see. Well, if you'll excuse me, I must be going.\nDAD: Oh, dear. I'll see you out.\nFRANK: Sister? Any chance of a call-up?\nDAS: (Weary) Oh no, Frank. Not now.\nCONSTANT: You're a_ bit young for that, aren't you? We'll have to see. Heaven bless you all.\nCONSTANT: After a second we hear the bolts outside the hall being undone.\nYVONNE: _— (Whispering with glee~) Nyssa! That was brilliant. That\nYVONNE: sorted the old boot out. Wasn't that brilliant, Frank?\nFRANK: (Sulking) Brilliant.\nNYSSA: Surely if she can go, I can go too.\nNYSSA: The front door closes. Bolts etc.\nYVONNE: It's not _ safe. (Calls out) Dad, tell her — she can't go.\nNYSSA: But my friend...\nDAD: (Coming back) Put the kettle on, Frank. By heck Nyssa,\nDAD: I wouldn't want to go a couple of rounds with you. But Vonnie's right. You're better off here.\nNYSSA: I hope I wasn't rude.\nNYSSA: DAD To the Sisterman? There's not much courtesy behind her\nNYSSA: curtains, as my dad used to say. As for your friend... well, he'll just have to look after hisself.\nNYSSA: 7. PHONE BOX.\nNYSSA: The apparatus is very old fashioned - Sixties style. CONSTANT is dialling a number. Two beats. We hear faint ringing. The line is answered. Faint du- du-du-du-du. A clunk as CONSTANT drops in a coin and presses button A.\nCONSTANT: It's Constant. I have a_ selectee at (very precise) North District Block Nine, Apartment Thirty-One - Hartley Nine Eight Dee. And I'm reporting a _ stranger at the same _ location. Check first mame Nyssa and the surname is something like O'Traken, possibly bogus. Warn all patrols to be on the lookout for any more unregistered strangers.\nDODD: So, yes or no?\nDOCTOR: Sorry?\nDODD: That drink.\nDOCTOR: Ah. No. Thank you.\nDODD: Best not to hang about, then, Doctor. Curfew. Police'll be\nDODD: round soon. They don't like people to be out after dark.\nDOCTOR: Mr Dodd, what is the population of the City these days?\nDODD: Down to a few thousand.\nDODD: DOCTOR And this is the last inhabited City on the planet?\nDODD: (Cautious) On Mondas?\nDODD: Course it is. Where've you been?\"\nDOCTOR: (Glum) That's one question answered. No wonder\nDOCTOR: business is bad. You're nearly extinct. Doorbell as he opens the door.\nDODD: Oi, where you going?\nDODD: 9. STREET.\nDODD: The DOCTOR and DODD emerge and start walking.\nDODD: You're not an escaped Cryo'speriment, are you? 'Cos you\nDODD: can't refreeze once you're thawed out.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, I'm meeting a friend. And I'm late already.\nPOLICEMAN: (Short way off) Stop!\nPOLICEMAN: The POLICEMAN'S voice has the hard sing-song lilt not unlike, but not as extreme as, those of the _ first Cybermen of Mondas. The DOCTOR and\nDODD: stop’ in’ their tracks. The electronic snort of a __ Cybersteed.\nDOCTOR: (Mutter) Committee Police?\nDODD: Told you.\nDODD: The horse starts to clip-clop slowly closer. It may _ have hydraulic _fetlocks too.\nDOCTOR: Remarkable. Unlike, but not unlike. And with a processed,\nDOCTOR: armoured horse too. The horse stops.\nDODD: (Cautious) Good evening, officer.\nPOLICEMAN: Identify yourself. Civilian movement is forbidden during hours of curfew.\nDOCTOR: No blank mask yet. Still recognisably human for all the\nDOCTOR: augmented bodywork...\nPOLICEMAN: Identify yourself.\nDOCTOR: ..but not as advanced as I'd anticipated. That's\nDOCTOR: encouraging. A whip lashes and cracks. The DOCTOR cries out in pain.\nDODD: He says he's a doctorman.\nDOCTOR: (In pain) And this one says he's a paragon of virtue, but\nDOCTOR: I wouldn't believe either of us.\nPOLICEMAN: Stand up.\nPOLICEMAN: The DOCTOR rises with difficulty.\nDOCTOR: I was standing before you knocked me down... thank you,\nDOCTOR: officer.”\nPOLICEMAN: These streets are sealed. Present your Identification Papers.\nDOCTOR: I don't have an identity. Not as far as you're concerned.\nDODD: Don't antagonise him.\nDOCTOR: I doubt he has the knack to get even slightly disgruntled.\nDOCTOR: (Slapping his pockets) Now, where did I put that Chinese cracker? (Finds it) Aha.\nDOCTOR: POLICED/IAN Do not move. Give your name and district.\nDOCTOR: The horse clip clops closer.\nDODD: What're you doing?\nDOCTOR: Matches, matches... Just a small diversion.\nPOLICEMAN: Name and district are required.\nPOLICEMAN: He strikes a match.\nDOCTOR: Best kept away from animals.\nPOLICEMAN: Defiance is unacceptable. Surrender now.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) Whatever happened to resistance is useless?\nDOCTOR: (Aloud as he strikes another match) Sorry to keep you.\nDOCTOR: The firework starts to hiss. The whip cracks again. The DOCTOR yells in\nDOCTOR: pain again.\nPOLICEMAN: You are to be detained under the aegis of the Central Comm...\nPOLICEMAN: The firecracker starts to explode In a series of bangs. The horse shies.\nDOCTOR: Run!\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR and DODD _ scarper. As the firework goes’ off, _ the Cyberpoliceman struggles to control its steed. But there is no emotion in its voice.\nPOLICEMAN: Warning... Warning. The horse calms.\nPOLICEMAN: Two _ suspects’ proceeding along ‘Third Street away from restricted area. I cannot leave my post. (Fade out) I cannot leave my post.\nPOLICEMAN: 10. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM.\nPOLICEMAN: Domestic bliss etc... and a_ caged _ bird twitters occasionally. I NYSSA's clearing china plates and cutlery.\nDAD: Help clear the table, Frank. Don't leave it all to Nyssa.\nFRANK: I've got homework...\nYVONNE: (Sarcy) Aahh. Too difficult, is it?\nFRANK: No. But J had to entertain the Sisterman.\nYVONNE: She should be so lucky. Eric Krailford says...”\nFRANK: Oh, Eric Krailford. I saw Eric Krailford smooching with\nFRANK: Elsie Phipps in the turnip queue.\nYVONNE: You little liar!\nFRANK: She was crying 'cos Eric's gone and...’*\nDAD: Frank! We have a guest! Do your homework!\nDAD: Beat.\nNYSSA: What sort of homework is it?\nFRANK: (Superior) Logic and cybertechnics.”\nNYSSA: Perhaps I could help. I know a lot about...\nFRANK: What?\nDAD: Frank!\nFRANK: (Sulky) No, thanks.\nNYSSA: Sorry.\nDAD: Take no notice of him, Nyssa.\nDAD: NYSSA The tea was very nice, Mr Hartley. Thank you. But J still\nDAD: think I should go.\nDAD: DAD And I've told you, it's not safe. Any road, we couldn't turn\nDAD: you out. Not so close to the holiday. We'll see you get an early tram.\nNYSSA: But it's not really like that.\nYVONNE: (Whistles couple of notes) Trillerby's still not singing properly.\nFRANK: Stupid bird.\nYVONNE: He used to pick up songs just like that. (To the bird) Come on, Trillerby. (Whistles again)\"°\nNYSSA: What sort of bird is he?\nYVONNE: Trillerby Mark 2: But he's got a bit worn out.\nNYSSA: Oh. (Half laughs) I thought he was real.\nFRANK: Real!\nYVONNE: He is real, Frank. Half and _ half. Just a bit rusty, — that's all.\nNYSSA: (Embarrassed) Yes. Of course.\nNYSSA: The bird goes on tweeting.\nDAD: Now, Nyssa, you're not grand, are you? Only if you're\nDAD: technically minded...\nNISSA: What is it?\nNISSA: DAD The chest box, you see. Plays up something chronic at night.\nNYSSA: If it's medical, my friend's a Doctor...\nDAD: Not medical. Just a bit of technical jiggery pokery. And I thought maybe...\nNYSSA: Can I see? Hold still.\nDAD: Not something I'd bother the Sisterman with...\nNYSSA: It's a bit primitive. Do you have a screwdriver?\nNYSSA: A loud banging on the front door.\nWOMAN: (Outside, terrified) Let me in! Help! Please! Help!\"’ The banging continues.\nYVONNE: Oh, no.\nDAD: (Scared) Frank, quick. Turn on the telly.\nWOMAN: Please! Help me! Help! Let me in! (Etc...)\nWOMAN: The TV sound comes on - something that sounds very Fifties that we can have fun with.\nNYSSA: Who is it?\nDAD: Well, it's not carol singers. Just don't answer.\nDAD: The WOMAN continues yelling and banging.\nYVONNE: It's Mrs Ginsberg.\nNYSSA: But we can't ignore her.\nDAD: Louder, Frank.\nDAD: The TV sound goes louder. So does the banging.\nDAD: Daft woman. That's what happens if you're out after dark.\nNYSSA: I've got to help her.\nYVONNE: Nyssa, come back! A whip crack outside. The knocking stops. The WOMAN'S yells fade into the distance. The TV sound burbles on\".\nDAD: She's gone. Turn it off, lad. The sound goes off:\nNYSSA: I don't understand. What's happened to her?\nYVONNE: Don't touch the curtains.\nNYSSA: pulls back the material.\nNYSSA: Why are the windows boarded up? Outside the tramp of marching feet approaches.\nYVONNE: (Afraid) Listen. The patrols.\nDAD: Quiet. Must be Police.”\nFRANK: I said she shouldn't stay.\nFRANK: The marching is going past.\nNYSSA: What is it? I don't want to get you in trouble.\nNYSSA: The sound of an approaching heavy truck.\nDAD: Whole bloomin' convoy of them. On manoeuvres at this\nDAD: time of night? Now what are they playing at?\nYVONNE: (Afraid) Dad.\nDAD: Well, we don't want to know, do we? It's not our business. Put the kettle on, Frank, and then there's the holiday decorations to put up.\nDAD: 11. ENTRANCE TO AN ALLEY. Heavy trucks rumble past every few seconds. THOMAS DODD _ is from the shadows.\nDAD: watching\nDOCTOR: Mr Dodd?\nDODD: (Jumping) Strewth!\nDOCTOR: Are you following me?\nDODD: (Relief) Oh Doctor. You gave the old paddles a turn.\nDODD: Didn't know we were going the same way home.\nDOCTOR: What a coincidence. I was heading for the picturehouse\nDOCTOR: when these trucks appeared.\nDODD: Watch it!\nDODD: A particularly large truck lumbers past.\nDOCTOR: That was some sort of mechanical digger. Something's\nDOCTOR: going on under cover of darkness.”’ Yes?\nDODD: Oh, yes. Never seen so many police. The whole area's\nDODD: cordoned off, right down to the North Stalagstacks.\nDOCTOR: And?\nDODD: Word is they're levelling the area for new parade\nDODD: grounds.\nDODD: Another truck thunders past.\nDOCTOR: So many of them. Let's take a look.\nDODD: You can't. You'll never get through.\nDOCTOR: Don't say you don't know a back route, Mr Dodd. If the\nDOCTOR: trucks are going in empty, what'll they be bringing out? It won't be tea and cakes, that's for certain.\nDOCTOR: 12. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM. The family and NYSSA get out the decorations.\nDAD: Here we are then. One tree.\nYVONNE: Pworh. Dad!\nDAD: Aye, well, maybe it's seen better days.”' But with a few baubles and a bit of tinsel... What d'you think, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (Unsure) It'll be like the tree in the square. What about\nNYSSA: your chest unit? Is it better?\nDAD: Humming along a treat now. You're a tonic, lass. Thank you.\nFRANK: I can't do homework with all this going on.\nDAD: Then come and help with the washing up.”\nYVONNE: Good riddance to bad rubbish.\nFRANK: Just don't nick all the baubles for earrings.”\nYVONNE: plonks a box down and starts to rustle through the decorations.\nYVONNE: Take no notice. Brothers are like that.\nNYSSA: So I gather.\nYVONNE: You'll be glad to get back to your family for the holiday.\nNYSSA: (Very subdued) Yes, I'd really like that.\nYVONNE: Oh, look. Here's the star for the top. I suppose you _ have a really posh tree at home.\nNYSSA: Well, not really. Not like this. But at our autumn festival, when the leaves were turning amber, wed hang all the trees in the garden with paper lanterns. And all the fruits - all purple and red, were\nNYSSA: carried in on _ silver panniers. And the people would sing at the gates. I used to love that.” YVONNE A whole garden of trees? The only real trees are in_ the hydrohouses where [I work. And _ the lit-up one in Committee Palace Square, of course.\nNYSSA: Sorry, Yvonne. I like to imagine things.\nYVONNE: Me too. I just want us all to be together again. Mum and Dad. Even Prank.\nNYSSA: Yes. Mother and Father. And the Doctor too.\nYVONNE: Don't worry about your friend.\nNYSSA: I was thinking about that poor woman out there.\nYVONNE: rustles decorations.\nYVONNE: (Sharp) Taken into care, I expect. The Committee does whatever's for the best. Oh, look. It's Matty. He's been’ missing for ages.\nNYSSA: (Rather revolted) What is it?\nYVONNE: He's = my -= ~mat. He must’ have’ been _ hibernating in _ the decorations box.\nNYSSA: But it's a metal worm.\nYVONNE: Didn't you ever have one? They were the _ latest craze - ages ago. Matty? Come on, wake up. Matty?\nNYSSA: It's alive, isn't it? Half machine.\nYVONNE: Dad got him for me. Catching them's what he does. The mats that got away and went wild.”\nNYSSA: Uncredulous) He's a mat-catcher?\nYVONNE: Yep. Matty? Come on...\nMATTY: emits a sluggish meep.\nYVONNE: No, he's not right.\nNYSSA: Can I see? Perhaps I can fix him for you.\nNYSSA: 13. CHURCH TOWER. The DOCTOR and DODD climb the wooden stairs.\nDODD: Up here's the church tower's clock room.\nDODD: DOCTOR The Church of Former-Day Souls. I'm right behind you, Mr Dodd.\nDODD: They reach the clock room - wooden floor.\nDODD: This is it. Mind the workings in the dark.\nDOCTOR: These cogs are like mill-wheels. (Moves to the edge) Quite\nDOCTOR: a view though, if it was light.\nDOCTOR: DODD In daytime, you could see all the City from the bell tower,\nDOCTOR: before the Church got abandoned.\nDOCTOR: Like the picturehouse. Ah the old temples of worship\nDOCTOR: closing. (Craning out) Now, what’ are they up to down _ there?\nDODD: Levelling the area. I told you.\nDOCTOR: Without touching the buildings? No, I think their purpose\nDOCTOR: is far more specific.\nDODD: Why? What else could they possibly...*° (Horrified\nDODD: realisation) Blimey, Doctor. They're digging up the graveyard. Footsteps behind them.\nDOCTOR: Careful. We have company.\nPOLICEMAN: Do not move. You are recognised escapees and are\nPOLICEMAN: required for adjudication.\nPOLICEMAN: 14. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN & FRONT ROOM. DAD and FRANK drying dishes.\nFRANK: She didn't eat much. Just picked at it. All our rations for the holiday going to waste.\nDAD: We'll manage. Pass that dish.\nFRANK: You know what's happening, don't you?\nDAD: What's that?”’\nFRANK: (Irritated) The manoeuvres, Dad. It's the final push. The work crews are on the verge of breaking through to _ the _— surface.\nDAD: You know what I think about that. It's a long way off. If ever.\nDAD: From the front room comes the sound of NYSSA and YVONNE laughing.\nFRANK: Dad?\nDAD: Yes, Frankie.\nFRANK: I want to join up. There's no point in waiting for the call-\nFRANK: up papers. I want to be in there now, when the breakthrough comes. I want to see the sky and not go mad.\nDAD: (Gently) That's very heroic, son. But you know the answer.\nFRANK: (Indignant) I'm not too young. And I'd send home my pay. DAD And we'd never see you again.\nFRANK: That's not true.\nDAD: Name one person we know who's come back from the\nDAD: work crews. Tom Reynolds? The Chang twins? I don't want to be proud of a_ black-bordered telegram with sympathy from the Central Committee. I want my son here.\nNYSSA: (Under this) Mr Hartley? Yvonne and I thought...\nFRANK: Eric Krailford's joining up.\nYVONNE: Eric? (Coming in) That's not true!\nDAD: Yvonne.\nYVONNE: Eric wouldn't!\nDAD: Course it's not true.\nFRANK: It is true!\nYVONNE: He wouldn't go. (Starts to cough) He wouldn't.\nNYSSA: Yvonne...\nDAD: Vonnie. Come on, love.\nNYSSA: What's the matter with her?\nYVONNE: (Spluttering) Just my pills. I'll be fine. Pills rattle from a jar.\nDAD: There you are, sweetheart. Gently now.\nFRANK: What about me? You never listen to me! You look after\nFRANK: strangers and give them our rations. And _ nothing's left now from what you got when you sold Mum! He slams the door.”\nDAD: Prank! (Exasperated beat) Nyssa, I'm so sorry.\nNYSSA: No, please. Yvonne's more important.\nYVONNE: (Weak) Much better already.\nDAD: That's right.\nNYSSA: Mr Hartley, I'm going now. I've caused enough trouble.\nYVONNE: Oh Nyssa, no.\nNYSSA: You mustn't stop me. I can look after myself.\nDAD: I feel... well, it's not good enough.\nNYSSA: I'm putting you all in danger. I'll speak to my friend, the\nNYSSA: Doctor. And we'll bring you some food to make up for what you've given me. But I must go. You've all been so kind...\nNYSSA: A thunderous knocking at the door.\nYVONNE: (Terrified whisper) Police.\nDAD: Vonnie, into your room I Take Nyssa.\nYVONNE: Through the back bedroom. Quickly! More bangs on the door.\nDAD: I'll hold them up as long as I can.\nDAD: 15. CHURCH TOWER - CLOCK ROOM.\nPOLICEMAN: This area is restricted to civilians.\nDOCTOR: Why? What aren't we supposed to see?\nPOLICEMAN: You are recognised criminals - required for adjudication\nPOLICEMAN: by the Committee.\nDODD: Leg it, Doctorl\nDODD: The DOCTOR yells in _ pain as the I CYBERPOLICEMAN — grabs him.\nPOLICEMAN: You are under arrest.\nDOCTOR: (Struggling) Twice in one day? I think not!\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR and POLICEMAN stumble forward and knock the clock\nDOCTOR: mechanism. A clunk. A whirring sound. The giant cogs start to clunk\nDOCTOR: forward all round them. Clunk. Clunk etc...\nDOCTOR: (Half muffled) Mr Dodd! Thomas! Help me!\nPOLICEMAN: Do not resist.\nPOLICEMAN: A large chain rattles through.\nDODD: I got him.\nDODD: A loud thunk as DODD hits the POLICEMAN with a_ piece of wood. The\nPOLICEMAN: makes sing-song cries as he stumbles backwards into the chain.\nDOCTOR: Look out!\nDOCTOR: Clank. Crunch. The POLICEMAN’ is’ mangled between’ the _ spinning cogs. His cry whizzes back and _ forth between the two sound channels. Then he\nDOCTOR: drops lifeless to the floor. The cogs go on clunking.\nDOCTOR: (Gasping) Thomas. Give me a hand with these ropes.\nDODD: (Stunned) I can't think. He was... And then you... Who\nDODD: are you?\nDOCTOR: Please. The bell ropes. Gather as many as you can.\nDODD: Here.\nDOCTOR: Now, if we wind them round the pendulum. And let the\nDOCTOR: cog wheels take up the slack.\nDODD: Digging up the graveyard. Disgusting, that's what it is.”\nDODD: That's going too far.\nDOCTOR: Thomas, how do you see the future of this City in... oh,\nDOCTOR: five years' time?\nDODD: Sorry, mate. I've a business to run. I don't do philosophy.\nDODD: The ropes start to creak.\nDOCTOR: You've never bothered to think past your own front\nDOCTOR: counter. But you better had. Because this City's heading for a very nasty\nDOCTOR: future indeed. First bong.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And that thing lying there, that travesty that was once a\nDOCTOR: human being, is part of it. Second bong.\nDOCTOR: I don't know how long it'll take. I'm not even sure I want to stop it. But I can give you a wake-up call.\nDOCTOR: Third bong.\nDOCTOR: Because it's up to you, not me, to change things and stop\nDOCTOR: this horror once and for all. Fourth bong.\nDOCTOR: 16. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - HALL. Wood splinters as the Cyberpolice pound on the front door.\nDAD: All right. Wait, win you!\nDAD: He pushed back bolts and opens the door. Distant bells.\nDAD: I've got a poorly daughter, you know. What do you lot\nDAD: want?\nPOLICEMAN: This household is hiding a stranger.\nDAD: Oh, it is, is it?\nPOLICEMAN: All reports must be checked.\nDAD: There's no privacy these days. Not even in your own\nDAD: home.\nDAD: Fade back from this conversation as we move to YVONNE'S” room for Scene 17. DAD can still be heard arguing in the distance.”\nDAD: POLICEMAN’ This apartment is registered for three occupants. Search the premises.\nDAD: Now hold on a minute. How'd you like me to come turning\nDAD: over your private property?\nPOLICEMAN: Stand aside.\nDAD: Stand aside, sir! Whatever happened to civil rights? Here,\nDAD: leave that alone, you! In the old days, you had to have a= special warrant from the _ police station. Nowadays the blooming Central Committee just tramples on everything. Mind that vase!\"!\nDAD: A crash of breaking china - which can punctuate this tirade at any _ point once Scene 17 has finished.\nDAD: 17. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - YVONNE'S ROOM. The final part of DAD's_ protests from Scene 16 can be _ heard in_ the background.\nYVONNE: (Urgent) Go on,’ Nyssa. There's no one’ in_ the alley.\nNYSSA: Yvonne. I'm sorry.\nYVONNE: Thanks for helping Dad. Here. Take this. NYSSA The Cybermat?”\nYVONNE: Just take it. It's yours.\nNYSSA: But...\nYVONNE: We'll be all right. Go on. Go!\nYVONNE: The crash comes from downstairs.\nYVONNE: 18. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM.\nDAD: (Very upset) Automated ruffians! That was my wife's...\nDAD: lie cries out in pain as a POLICEMAN grabs him.\nPOLICEMAN: Where is the intruder?\nFRANK: Leave my dad alone! She's in the back room.\nDAD: No, Frank.\nDAD: The POLICEMAN releases DAD.\nFRANK: Through there. The POLICEMEN start to move.\nYVONNE: (Coming in) Frank, how could you!\nPOLICEMAN: Hold her.\nYVONNE: cries out.\nFRANK: Not her! She's my sister!\nYVONNE: is released.\nYVONNE: FRANK In the back room.\nYVONNE: The POLICEMEN move out.\nYVONNE: (Hissed whispers) How could you!\nFRANK: They were hurting dad.\nDAD: Has Nyssa gone?\nYVONNE: Yes.\nDAD: Good. (Foreboding) Now, what'll they do with the rest of us?\nDAD: The distant bell is still audible.\nYVONNE: What's that? Can you hear it?\nDAD: (Mystified) The church. That's the bell in the old tower. It's not rung for years\nYVONNE: But what does it mean? Is it a warning?\nYVONNE: 19. STREET - OUTSIDE THE TARDIS. The church bell is echoing across the city. General murmur of people moving on the street.\nDOCTOR: (Approaching) Can I get past, please. Thank you. Thanks.\nNYSSA: Doctor, thank goodness.\nDOCTOR: (A bit manic) Nyssa. Well done for getting back here. Sorry to keep you waiting.\nNYSSA: There's a lot of people.*’ All of a sudden.\nNYSSA: The DOCTOR fumbles the key into the TARDIS lock.\nDOCTOR: Yes. That's the idea. Come on. Into the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: 20. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. Hum of the engines. The DOCTOR and NYSSA enter.\nNYSSA: I knew this wasn't Earth.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But I just had to make sure this was the planet\nDOCTOR: I thought it was. Before...\nNYSSA: Before what?\nNYSSA: The doors close.\nDOCTOR: Before I take us away from here.\nDOCTOR: He starts flicking switches.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. You can't do that.\nDOCTOR: You heard that bell? It's a reveille - to wake people up. And once they see what's going on, they can take control of their own destiny.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Please don’t argue. I am not staying. I know this plase’s future.\nNYSSA: So do I.\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: It's obvious. And horrible too. One day the people of this city will become the Cybermen. It's already happening.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, this is Mondas. Earth's long-lost twin planet. And I can't interfere with its future.\nNYSSA: But there aren't Cybermen yet.\nDOCTOR: Not yet, but soon.\nNYSSA: We can stop it before it goes too far.\nDOCTOR: No. If anyone changes the future of Mondas, it must be the people themselves. If we're discovered here, then the whole future of the galaxy will be unbalanced - and we'll be to blame.\nDOCTOR: 21. CENTRAL COMMITTEE CHAMBER. The gentle pulse of dozens of life-support units ranged all round the cavernous resonant chamber.\nCYBERMAN: (One of the original Tenth Planet-sfcyJe voices - of which the POLICEMEN so far encountered are only a pale foreshadow) Police patrols report a disturbance in the city. Hostile intruders have been observed.\nCYBERMAN: Bedeep-bedeep-bedeep of data processing over a cacophony of slightly processed, but still human voices.\nVOICES: Police patrol report.\nVOICES: A disturbance in the city\nVOICES: Hostile intruders have been observed.\nVOICES: Finally the voices unite into one single chorus voice: that of the Central Committee.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS The Committee is agreed. Insurgency must be crushed. Find the intruders and eliminate them immediately."

Insurgency must be crushed. Find the intruders and eliminate them immediately.\nCOMMITTEE: 22. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. The DOCTOR and NYSSA arguing.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, the people of Mondas must decide their future for\nDOCTOR: themselves.\nNYSSA: But they're suffering terribly. They're good people, and\nNYSSA: some of them are sick. I've promised to help.\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: (Quietly determined) I have to, Doctor. And if you won't\nNYSSA: get involved, then I must stay behind and do it by myself.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Where are you going?\nNYSSA: (Heading for her room) To get my things.\nDOCTOR: No! (Dashes after her) Nyssa. You're being unreasonable.\nNYSSA: Am I? I want to give those people some hope. I want to\nNYSSA: stop the Cybermen from coming into existence.\nDOCTOR: Yes, very laudable, but you can't do it on your own. You're not an army. You can't turn the whole of history round on a_ sixpence.\nNYSSA: I've seen you do it.\nDOCTOR: Not in this case. If we stop one history, we only replace it\nDOCTOR: with another, probably equally as bad. Believe me, I know. NYSSA And what have you been doing? What about your 'wake-\nDOCTOR: up’ call?\nDOCTOR: (Deep breath) Look, the Cybermen's future is infamous\nDOCTOR: across the Galaxy: Earth's twin’ planet wandering out of its orbit. Its dwindling population, already millennia) ahead of Earth _ technologically, gradually replacing bodily organs with manufactured parts. All in a__ final desperate bid to avoid extinction.\nNYSSA: Until they finally replace their own consciousness with\nNYSSA: the cold precision of machine logic.\nNYSSA: DOCTOR The cold logic that snuffs out the spark in people. I'm not\nNYSSA: even sure they are people by the end. They're just so many _ tinned _left- overs.\nNYSSA: The perspective pulls back as_ they continue. They become more _ distant as if heard from the console room.\nDOCTOR: I think I'd rather lose all my other lives than become a\nDOCTOR: Cyberman.\nDOCTOR: As they argue, the Cybermat in NYSSA's bag bleeps_ sluggishly and __bleeps again as if it's waking up.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA The people I met were actually very kind.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm sure. But you must see... the infinity of Time\nDOCTOR: and Space is all laid out like a huge game of consequences. (And _ back into close perspective as the DOCTOR’ works up steam) Sometimes you play, sometimes you sit on _ the _ sideline, sometimes you run on _ afterwards’ with a stretcher.\nNYSSA: Yes, we've had this discussion before (Very sharp) A pity that didn't occur to you when it came to sacrificing Adric. Beat.\nDOCTOR: (Stunned) Ah... Yes... Adric. So much that never gets said... Bound to boil over sooner or later.\nNYSSA: Excuse me, I have some things to sort out.\nNYSSA: She closes her door quietly. In the distance, we hear the Cybermat burble past and away.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Erm, I'll be waiting.\nDOCTOR: 23. CITY STREET. The church bell is still ringing. A crowd of people milling about. The CYBERPOLICEMAN's voice echoes out over the throng.\nDOCTOR: POLICEMAN’ Clear’ these streets. Return to your homes. There is nothing to see. You are breaking the curfew.\nCITIZEN: Leave the graves alone! CITIZEN2 You ghouls! Leave them in peace!\nCITIZEN: The crowd takes up the chant of ‘Rest in peace! Rest in peace!’, banging dustbin lids in time.\nPOLICEMAN: Return to your homes. Entrance to the area is prohibited\nPOLICEMAN: by the Central Committee.\nPOLICEMAN: The chanting goes on.\nCONSTANT: (Approaching) Captain.\nPOLICEMAN: Sisterman Constant.\nCONSTANT: What's happening? Who started the bell?\nPOLICEMAN: Unnamed intruders have been observed.\nCONSTANT: I reported a stranger myself. The bell stops ringing. The chanting flags a bit.\nCONSTANT: Well, thank the sky above for that.\nCONSTANT: POLICEMAN The Central Committee advises that force may be employed to disperse the crowd.\nCONSTANT: Do they’ indeed? Then you'd’ better get on_- with itl\nPOLICEMAN: First squad... advance!\nPOLICEMAN: Whips start to crack. In the melee, we hear the sounds of horses' hooves. The crowd” gives’ occasional yells and screams.  Cyberpolice are _ saying, 'Get back. Get back’. Fade.\nPOLICEMAN: 24. TARDIS CORRIDOR.\nNYSSA: (Cautious) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa.\nNYSSA: I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn't mean it. Not in that way. I just\nNYSSA: realised what this place is. And what it means. And _ Adiric...\nDOCTOR: Poor Adric. We never really stopped to mourn him.\nDOCTOR: I suppose on  Traken there are profound and_ beautiful ceremonies to honour fallen heroes.\nNYSSA: But they'd seem out of place here. (Beat) The family\nNYSSA: I met, the Hartleys, had very little to live on. Everything's rationed by some sort of Central Committee. I just want to take them some _ food.\nDOCTOR: (Darkly) Yes, the Committee again. (Giving in) Yes. Yes,\nDOCTOR: of course you must. I can wait.\nNYSSA: Thank you.\nNYSSA: Opens console room door. The TARDIS hum is louder.\nDOCTOR: There are signs of Cybertechnology everywhere. Even the\nDOCTOR: police horses. More machine than animal.\nNYSSA: Oh, I forgot. Yvonne gave me something.\nDOCTOR: What's that?\nDOCTOR: She starts to rummage through her bag.\nNYSSA: Where is it? It's too big to just disappear.\nDOCTOR: What was it Uke?\nNYSSA: It was her pet. But it was half machine too. Like a silver worm.\nNYSSA: DOCTOR A Cybermat? You brought a Cybermat into my TARDIS?!\nNYSSA: 25. COMMITTEE PALACE - HOSPITAL WARD.\nNYSSA: Unlike the run-down feel of the _ city, the Central Committee Palace is advanced and hi-tech. In the —_ processing wards, surgeon-general Dr Christine Allan and her staff are in crisis. A repeater alarm buzzes.\nALLAN: Nurse! Patient six-seven!\nNURSE: Yes, Doctorman Allan.\nNURSE: The trundle of screens being pulled round a bed.\nALLAN: (Urgent) His pulmonary unit's rejecting. Switch to auto-\nALLAN: backup before his logic walls go down.\nALLAN: The buzzer alarm continues with a new whining hum.\nALLAN: ALLAN And give him a shot of morphine.\nALLAN: But the patient gasps and emits a cybergurgle of pain. A crash of surgical pans hitting the floor.\nALLAN: Hold him! The spluttering gurgle increases.\nALLAN: Hurry! He'll drown in his own plasma! (Exasperation)\nALLAN: Give me that!** She wrests hold of the controls. The buzzer rate speeds up momentarily. The patient gives a_ final forced — gurgle. Electricity crackles. Liquid\nALLAN: splatters on the _ floor. The buzzer = goes to a continuous tone.\nALLAN: Damn!\nNURSE: Sorry, Doctor.\nALLAN: Just clear it away. (Beat) I need a drink.\nALLAN: She pushes aside the screens. The buzzer tone stops. CONSTANT is waiting outside.\nCONSTANT: Good evening, doctorman.\nALLAN: Sisterman Constant. You're back from recruiting early.\nALLAN: Bring your reports into the office.\nCONSTANT: I see we've lost another crewman.\nCONSTANT: Swish of sliding doors. The sound of the ward changes to the closeness of ALLAN'S office.\nALLAN: That's the third back from the surface in two days. The\nALLAN: processing won't . stabilise. They barely survive a week out’ there. Drink? She pours herself a glass.\nCONSTANT: No, thank you. Are you sure you should? (Beat) Doctorman, your staff are exhausted.\nALLAN: What do you expect? We're working all hours with no\nALLAN: resources, but the Committee just demands more and more. We need to\nALLAN: stop everything and rethink. (Drinks)\nCONSTANT: You know there's been trouble in the City.\nALLAN: What sort of trouble?\nCONSTANT: Nearly a riot.\nALLAN: You're joking.\nCONSTANT: Someone set off the bell in the old church. Right _ beside the dig.\nALLAN: (Laughs) Now there's a surprise.\nCONSTANT: (Disapproving) Really, doctorman.\nALLAN: That's the funniest thing I've heard in months. I hope\nALLAN: they call the whole disgusting project off. As if dead bones will help. Who did it anyway?\nALLAN: CONSTANT The Police don't know. But I saw a= strange girl with some of my patients. And there are reports of others too. ALLAN In what way strange?\nCONSTANT: I didn't know her. And _ she certainly had no_ papers. That's why I reported her.\nALLAN: But what was she like?\nCONSTANT: Very healthy looking. Well dressed and _ fed. No _ pallor.\nALLAN: No one is well fed. Perhaps she was a rabble-rouser.\nCONSTANT: It seems logical No doubt the Police’ will round them all up.\nCONSTANT: An announcement bing bong. From the PA’ system comes the chorus _ voice of the Committee.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Doctor Allan. You are’ required in the Central Committee chamber.\nALLAN: Now what? (Sigh) Take over the ward, Constant.\nCONSTANT: Yes, doctor.\nALLAN: No, it's absurd. How can strangers possibly exist?\nCONSTANT: Hadn't you better go?\nALLAN: When I'm ready, thank you, Sisterman. Sure I can't tempt\nALLAN: you? Just a little glass?\nCONSTANT: (Cold) I think I had better get to the ward. The door swishes again.\nALLAN: (Impersonating) 'I think I'd better get to the ward.’ Creep.\nALLAN: (To herself) Strangers... Presses an intercom button.\nALLAN: Switchboard? Put me through to the surveillance\nALLAN: department.\nALLAN: 26. TARDIS CORRIDOR. The DOCTOR rummaging - probably inside a roundel.\nNYSSA: (Hurrying up) Doctor? Any luck?\nDOCTOR: ( Very sharp) Wo.\nNYSSA: It must be somewhere. It can't have got out.\nDOCTOR: Obviously.\nDOCTOR: He fits back a panel.\nNYSSA: I'm sure Mr Hartley would help. He's a mat-catcher.\nDOCTOR: They're that much of a pest, are they? A distant alarm sounds.\nNYSSA: What's that?\nDOCTOR: (Running off) Console room!\nDOCTOR: A sharp mini explosion.\nDOCTOR: 27. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. The alarm sounding. Crackling __ electricity. The console makes = random buzzes of protest. The door bangs open as the DOCTOR flies in.\nDOCTOR: Console's on fire!\nDOCTOR: He grabs a mysteriously handy fire extinguisher. It gushes away.\nDOCTOR: That should hold it. (Coughs in the smoke)\nDOCTOR: Another fast alarm starts up. (Please, no Cloister Bell.) More crackling. The ship's hum is grating.\nNYSSA: What now?\nDOCTOR: Energy leak!\nDOCTOR: He flicks switches. The note of the alarm rises higher.\nDOCTOR: It's going to blow. Nyssa! The isolator failsafe!\nNYSSA: It's jammed!\nDOCTOR: Hit it!\nNYSSA: thumps the _— switch. The alarm falters, slows  and_ stops. The\nTARDIS: engine hum sinks to nothing. The DOCTOR prises off a_ panel under the console.\nDOCTOR: (Distaste) Ah, there you are. Your Cybermat's got into the\nDOCTOR: console stem.\nNYSSA: Is it dead?\nDOCTOR: Burnt out. It's gnawed right into the energy conduit.\nNYSSA: Doctor, I'm truly sorry. (Beat) We must have spares.\nNYSSA: I could mend it for you.”\nDOCTOR: It's not a bicycle puncture! (Beat. Calms a little) No, I'm\nDOCTOR: sorry too. Please take a look. You're good at this sort of thing. I'm going out for some fresh air.\nDOCTOR: 28. CENTRAL COMMITTEE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Ahead of us, the slow pulsing of a huge iron lung. Metal plates claxik. The chorus voice of the Committee echoes round us as Dr Allan stands at _ the heart of the chamber.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Doctorman Allan.\nALLAN: I'm busy. What do you need now?\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Power resources are low. Soon life in the City will be unsustainable.\nALLAN: You mean human life.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS You must work faster.\nALLAN: Impossible. My staff are dropping already. And the death\nALLAN: rate's increasing on the work crews.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS More surgical material will be provided.\nALLAN: More bones from the graveyards? I'm running a\nALLAN: transplant unit here. Not a_ back-street butchers with second-hand organs fitted under the counter.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Processing must increase.\nCOMMITTEE: ALLAN The people are weak. We need time to optimise the ratio\nCOMMITTEE: of technology to biology.\nCOMMITTEE: Bedeep, bedeep, bedeep. The Committee voices are _ all suddenly _ talking amongst themselves. Then they reunite.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS The Committee’ disagrees. Processing rates will be increased. The City uses too many vital resources. It will be shut down.\nALLAN: (Appalled) That's insane!**\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Sacrifices must be made.\nALLAN: Why? What's happened? What can possibly be more\nALLAN: important than saving the people?*’\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS We must survive.\nCOMMITTEE: 29. CITY STREET OUTSIDE THE TARDIS. A cybermat burbles - a_ different, more advanced burble to YVONNE'S pet. As the TARDIS door opens, it goes quiet.\nDOCTOR: I'll be back soon, Nyssa. (Spotting the creature) Hello? And what are you doing out here?*®\nDOCTOR: The cybermat starts to burble again.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, you don't!\nDOCTOR: He shuts the TARDIS door smartly.\nDOCTOR: No more Cybermats in my TARDIS. Go on, shoo!\nDOCTOR: The cybermat chitters.\nDOCTOR: Quite unlike the domestic version, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: He crouches to see better. From the  cybermat's’ point of view. Hum _ of electronic data being processed.\nDOCTOR: (Very tinny sound) Snazzy black-painted shell. Customised for official snooping business, I expect.\nDOCTOR: Back to normal perspective.\nFRANK: Careful of him. Watch out!\nFRANK: The cybermat chitters loudly and makes a dash for cover.\nDOCTOR: _ Youstartled him.\nFRANK: That's a Mark Twelve Surveillance model. The Committee uses them. You don't see many about.\nDOCTOR: Then I suppose I should count myself lucky. How do you\nDOCTOR: do, I'm the... I'm the Doctor.*”\nFRANK: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Quiet, isn't it? I half-hoped for a riot.”°\nFRANK: Do you know a girl called Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: Is your name Hartley? Father: a mat-catcher?\nFRANK: (Wary) Yep. I'm Prank Hartley.”’\nDOCTOR: Thank you for looking after her, Frank. I hope she wasn't too much trouble.\nFRANK: What? Before or after the police came for her?\nDOCTOR: Police? She never mentioned police.\nFRANK: So, Where's Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: You'll find her in here.\nDOCTOR: He unlocks the TARDIS door.\nDOCTOR: Go on, straight through.\nFRANK: (Confused) In there? But it's...\nDOCTOR: Nyssa will be delighted to explain the dimensional anomaly. I have a call to make. Tell her I'll be back... later. Good morning.\nDOCTOR: 30. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nNYSSA: working. The doors buzz open. FRANK walks in.\nFRANK: (Gobsmacked) Strewth!\nNYSSA: Prank? How did you get in?\nNYSSA: FRANK The Doctor... Is this place...? We're underground, aren't\nNYSSA: we... somehow.\nNYSSA: No. It's a dimensional anomaly.\nFRANK: That's what he said. I heard the Committee Palace was\nFRANK: like this.\nNYSSA: Why are you here, Prank? What did the police do?\nFRANK: Turned over the house. Questioned us for hours over who you were. Then they broke a few things and left.\nNYSSA: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble.\nFRANK: Then, first post, this official letter arrived.\nNYSSA: Yes?\nFRANK: Call-up papers for Yvonne.\nNYSSA: What does that mean?\nFRANK: (Annoyed) Call-up for the work crews? That's why the Sisterman visited. Picking out likely recruits.\nNYSSA: I don't understand. When does she go?\nFRANK: Gone already. Said it was her duty.\nNYSSA: Your poor father. He and Yvonne were so kind.\nFRANK: Never seen Dad so cut up. Keeps saying we'll never see\nFRANK: her again. He asked me to find you.\nNYSSA: Me? (Beat) Prank, I hope you understand why your\nNYSSA: father is so distressed. I know how I felt when my dear father went away.\nFRANK: What about me? How come it's Yvonne that has all the luck?\nFRANK: 31. COMMITTEE CHAMBER.\nFRANK: Two Committee sub-chorus voices debate from opposite sides of _ the chamber. The voices can be more or less identical. The iron lung heaves. Plates clank.\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 1 - Does’ Doctorman Allan understand her task?\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 2 She still has an illogical mind...\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 1 A weakness she refuses to relinquish.\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 2 She _ is _ skilled and must be _ trusted. She now understands the threat that may destroy us all. Bedeep bedeep bedeep of incoming data.\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 1. Disturbances in the City have been’ subdued. Two police casualties occurred.\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 2 The disturbance was a threat. Was it caused by the reported strangers?\nCOMMITTEE: VOICE 1 One stranger is under observation. He may lead us to more.\nCOMMITTEE: 32. DOCTOR ALLAN'S OFFICE.\nALLAN: is watching a_ relay’ of the DOCTOR from the _ surveillance cybermat. Hum of electronic data. Clink of a_ bottle and glass. ALLAN is a little worse for wear.\nDOCTOR: (Tinny and fuzzy) Ah, hello? Does your tram go past a shop or emporium run by one Thomas Dodd?\nALLAN: Dodd! That old hack! (Pours a drink)\nDOCTOR: (Tinny and fuzzy) Money? Well, no. Not exactly.\nDOCTOR: A knock at the door. The screen clicks off:\nALLAN: What!\nALLAN: The door swishes open as ALLAN swigs her glass.\nCONSTANT: Doctorman Allan. Your light was on.\nALLAN: Morning already, Constant?\nCONSTANT: I've recruits due in for processing.\nALLAN: They won't mind waiting. Have a glass of wine.”\nCONSTANT: No thank you.\nALLAN: Please yourself. Happy holiday. (Drinks)\nALLAN: CONSTANT And your meeting with the Committee?\nALLAN: Did they ever offer you augmentation?\nCONSTANT: We sistermen rely on our own disciplines.\nALLAN: Oh, how abstemious.\nCONSTANT: Is that what they offered you? Augmentation?\nALLAN: Think of the benefits. Increased efficiency. Clear thinking.\nALLAN: No more endless fatigue.\nCONSTANT: But full processing is only for the work crews up_ on_ the eurface.\nALLAN: They're upping the processing quotas.\nCONSTANT: What? But why?\nALLAN: (Mimicking the Committee) That data is secure.\nALLAN: Processing for everyone. That's where it'll end.\nCONSTANT: (Scared) What do they mean? I'm a Selector.\nALLAN: No one's exempt. Go on, forget your vows and have a\nALLAN: drink.*' Purely medicinal.\nCONSTANT: What happens to my _ =job if they process everyone? What are they thinking?\nALLAN: You'd better tell the other sisters.\nCONSTANT: I will. The door swishes.\nALLAN: (Laughing) Good morning, Sisterman.\nALLAN: The screen clicks back on. Buzz of data.\nDOCTOR: (On screen - flagging down a truck) Stop! Pull over!\nDOCTOR: You're losing your cargo!\nALLAN: Time to take a proper look at our 'stranger’, I think...\nALLAN: 33. CITY STREET. A heavy truck squeals to a sudden halt.\nDOCTOR: (Calling to driver) Your cargo. It's all along the road.\nDOCTOR: The truck cab door opens. The police driver jumps down.\nPOLICEMAN: You are recognised. An intruder.\nDOCTOR: No, no. Your cargo. Look.\nDOCTOR: He pulls up the canvas.\nDOCTOR: All these... (Distaste) stacks of bones.\nPOLICEMAN: They are secure.\nDOCTOR: (Pulling at straps) Not for long.\nDOCTOR: The strap gives. An avalanche of bones spills out onto the street catching the POLICEMAN.\nDOCTOR: (Climbing into the cab) Thanks for your help!\nDOCTOR: He slams the door and starts the engines. The truck moves off spilling\nDOCTOR: more bones.\nPOLICEMAN: '~ Emergency. Carrier Unit 3 = stolen’ by intruder. Travelling south up Fifth Street. Intercept immediately.\nPOLICEMAN: 34. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nNYSSA: working on the energy conduit, while FRANK  babbles. Maybe some buzzes and clicks as she works.\nFRANK: When will the Doctor be back?\nNYSSA: (Trying to concentrate) He didn't say, Prank. Hold this,\nFRANK: I thought maybe you'd both come to see Dad.\nNYSSA: You said your Dad asked you to find us.\nFRANK: (Embarrassed) Well... yeah. I just don't know what he'll\nFRANK: do, see.*°\nNYSSA: Now... I have to get this cabling duct to reseal itself... You\nNYSSA: know it was Yvonne's Cybermat that damaged this conduit in the first place\nFRANK: What? Old Matty?\nNYSSA: Yes. She gave it to me.\nFRANK: They go for cables. Under the pavements. The energy\nFRANK: attracts them.\nFRANK: Gentle hiss from the conduit.\nNYSSA: Good. That's sealing nicely.\nFRANK: When she went...\nNYSSA: Yvonne.\nFRANK: Yeah. The whole apartment block turned out to wave her\nFRANK: off. Like a hero.\nFRANK: NYSSA And you think that should have been you?\nFRANK: Course I do. Typical, that is.”\nNYSSA: flicks switches. The power comes on full again.\nNYSSA: Right. I think that should hold. That'll cheer the Doctor up.\nFRANK: I don't understand this place.\nNYSSA: Frank? The call-up? Does it involve some sort of\nNYSSA: processing?\nFRANK: Augmentation.\nNYSSA: (Afraid) I thought so. So there's no way to get Yvonne\nNYSSA: back.\nFRANK: I wish.\nFRANK: A burble of power. An alarm sounds.\nFRANK: What's that?\nNYSSA: buzzes open the scanner.\nNYSSA: NYSSA On the screen.\nFRANK: So many of them? It's a swarm.\nNYSSA: Cybermats. Ah over the outside of the TARDIS.\nNYSSA: 35. COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING WARD. Shuffle of feet as a _ column’ of processees moves past supervised by\nSISTER: CONSTANT.\nCONSTANT: Bless you. Bless you all. Keep in line there.\nALLAN: (Arriving) Constant, I'm leaving you in charge. I have an errand.\nCONSTANT: Down in the City?\nALLAN: Just keep them moving.

(Laughing) Oh, you'll get a\nALLAN: uniform all right.”\nCONSTANT: (Awkward) It's just a routine check-up, Yvonne. Just stay in Une. Heaven bless you now.\nYVONNE: Thank = you, -— sisterman. (She coughs as she moves _ away)\nALLAN: There's a sickly one.\nCONSTANT: Acute consumptive. I'd only’ give her two’ months’ if she didn't go for processing.\nALLAN: (Bitter) We live in a pit, Constant. The dark times are getting darker. I must go. Fade out.\nCONSTANT: Move on. Keep going. Bless you all.”\nCONSTANT: 36. COMMITTEE COUNCIL CHAMBER. General debate going on. A_ melee of overlapping voices: ‘The City is a\nCONSTANT: drain on resources’, 'We must survive’, ‘Shut down the City’, ‘All resources must be processed’, ‘All threats to efficiency must be eliminated, Zheng must be summoned’. Bedeep, bedeep of processing\nCONSTANT: data cuts the voices. Beat.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Agreed. No more dissension will be tolerated. The Police will apprehend the stranger.

DODD and DAD HARTLEY are arguing.\nDODD: I don't care, Mr Hartley. I don't keep a slate.\nDAD: (Desperate) Come on, Dodd. My arm's a bit dodgy, but it'll mend. The rest of me's fine.\nDODD: Apart from the heart box.\nDAD: I'm giving you everything, for God's sake. As security. You gave us credit when my wife passed away.\nDODD: I never speak ill of the departed. Your Mabel was quality and that's a fact. She did well for me.\nDAD: But I'm shop-soiled. I've got a lad to feed. My wife and daughter gone.\nDAD: The shop door opens tinkling the bell.\nDOCTOR: Good morning. DODD/DAD Back of the queue!\nDAD: What d'you say, Dodd? Please.\nDODD: (Very final) No credit! Finito!\nDAD: (Crushed) Nothing then... Nothing left.\nDOCTOR: Sorry to intrude, but...\nDODD: I said, back of the queue.\nDOCTOR: Which queue exactly?\nDODD: (Sudden recognition) Doctor! It's you! Well, that makes all\nDODD: the difference.\nDOCTOR: Your queue went. Rather rapidly, once they heard about\nDOCTOR: a beetroot truck spilling its load a couple of blocks\nDODD: Oh, very good. So what are you after now?\nDAD: (Vague) Doctor? You're a friend of young Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Yes. (Sudden realisation) You must be Mr Hartley. You were very kind to her.\nDAD: She did a grand job on my chest box. She'll make a good doctor too.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nDAD: (Confidential) They're digging up the graveyards, you\nDAD: know. Glad I didn't put my wife in there.\nDODD: Thank you, Mr Hartley. The Doctor's here to see me.\nDODD: He opens the tinkling\nDOCTOR: Yes, but...\nDAD: (Going) No, don't mind me. I'll be pushing off.\nDAD: The door shuts. DODD pulls down the blind and throws a couple of bolts.\nDOCTOR: Is he all right?\nDODD: Scroungers. Always on the make. Your riot didn't turn out too well either.\nDOCTOR: No. But I don't give up. That wasn't really a beetroot\nDOCTOR: sounds. Allan.\nDOCTOR: emergency surface. bedeep...\nDOCTOR: 50 away.\nDOCTOR: door.\nDOCTOR: truck. The contents of the graveyard are now scattered right up the High Street for everyone to see. Oh, don't worry, I parked as far away from your shop as possible.\nDODD: Doctor, what do you want?\nDODD: 38. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nTARDIS: hum. An alarm sounding. The walls are creaking slightly like the creak on board old_ sailing ships. A_ slight cluttering can be heard from outside. FRANK and NYSSA under siege.\nFRANK: They're all over. They'll find any crack and dig their way\nFRANK: in.\nFRANK: NYSSA The TARDIS's outer shell is built to stand up to far greater\nFRANK: pressures than a swarm of Cybermats.\nFRANK: But we can't get out either.\nNYSSA: They must be after the energy flow.\nFRANK: They can smell it a mile off.\nNYSSA: (Sudden worrying thought) Frank. Did you shut the outer\nNYSSA: door when you came in?\nFRANK: Well... I dunno.\nNYSSA: Otherwise we're going to be overrun.\nNYSSA: A sudden burst of chittering. FRANK The door...\nNYSSA: 39. THOMAS DODD'S SHOP.\nNYSSA: DODD and the DOCTOR.\nNYSSA: DODD The Committee Palace? You must be joking.\nDOCTOR: I wish I was. I could do with a good laugh.\nDODD: It's a fortress. Those massive gates.\nDOCTOR: Gates are for opening. And I have to know how far\nDOCTOR: they've gone.\nDODD: Who?\nDOCTOR: Your competition. The Committee. And while we're on the Bubject of spare parts... He pushes aside a chain curtain.\nDODD: Here. That's private. Come out of there.”\nDODD: pushes after the DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: Oh, really, Thomas. I thought you'd have better storage\nDOCTOR: facilities.\nDOCTOR: Heavy plastic rustles and metal hangers slide along rails.\nDODD: All vacuum packed for freshness. The real perishables are\nDODD: in the cold store. A _ full range of bodily organs, limbs - all sizes, colours\nDODD: and creeds.”\nDOCTOR: Mothers frighten their children to sleep with tales of\nDOCTOR: people like you. In the background we hear the burble of the cybermat.\nDODD: It's business. Trouble is demand's on the slide. People,\nDODD: even people with terminal injuries and blood running across the floor, all they want is titanium and plastic.” They think it'll last.\nDOCTOR: It's durable.\nDOCTOR: He opens the fridge. Whump of the seal. Slight hiss of escaping cold.\nDODD: I think it's just plain ugly. Some have so much it drives them crazy.’ So they have their emotions surgically removed too. We all\nDODD: want immortality, don't we? But with a chrome finish?\nDOCTOR: This cold store needs defrosting.\nDODD: Course what I need is fresh supplies. And then you came\nDODD: along...\nDOCTOR: Now just a minute...\nDODD: Well, that's too good to waste.\nDOCTOR: Thomas!\nDOCTOR: With a roar, THOMAS slams the fridge door shut. We hear the DOCTOR pounding on the inside of the fridge.\nDODD: Sorry, Doctor. I just froze your assets.\nDODD: 40. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nTARDIS: hum. Alarm sounding. From the door comes _ scrabbling and chittering.\nFRANK: They're trying to get through the door!\nNYSSA: If they're after the energy...\nFRANK: Then shut if off, why don't you! (Beat) Go on!\nNYSSA: No. If they want the energy, then we should give it to them.\nFRANK: What?\nNYSSA: starts to flick switches.\nNYSSA: It's what killed the other one.\nFRANK: Oh, right. That's what Dad does.” Like the Cheeser.\nNYSSA: (Forcing a dial round) If I can just... re-route the power\nNYSSA: to the TARDIS's outer shell. She flicks more switches. A burst of chittering. The door creaks\nNYSSA: alarmingly.\nFRANK: Hurry!\nNYSSA: All right. Stand clear.\nNYSSA: She plunges a_ lever forward. A_ violent crackling buzz of energy. We_ hear the cybermats screaming and_ frying. The alarm stops. NYSSA _ releases\nNYSSA: the lever. The TARDIS hum steadies.\nFRANK: It worked. Amazing.\nNYSSA: Not really. But it was worryingly satisfying.\nFRANK: Yeah? (Beat) Are we going now?\nNYSSA: We can't wait for the Doctor. I'll get some food. Then we'll\nNYSSA: go and find your poor father.\nNYSSA: 41. COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING UNIT.\nYVONNE: is’ inside the _ processing unit. Hum_ of = an_ industrial conveyor belt. Machine sounds slide past as YVONNE is carried along. We _ are moving towards something that sounds like several of the big rotating saws in abattoirs - hi-tech laser scalpels which make _ terrible harsh sounds slicing through bone and flesh.\nYVONNE: (Weak and_ confused) Dad? Where’ are’ you? Please, I want to go home... Please. Dad?\nYVONNE: The machinery halts. A deep building note of menace.\nYVONNE: (Fear) Who are you? What are you doing to me?\nCYBERMAN: You will join us. We are the future.\nCYBERMAN: The machinery engages. The belt moves again.\nYVONNE: (Petrified whisper - no screams) No. Please, fades off to side) Please. Help. Help me.”\nYVONNE: no. (She\nYVONNE: The ghastly winding, grating of the  scalpels drowns YVONNE out. (I think\nYVONNE: we should be spared the actual sawing through of bone at this point!)\nYVONNE: 42a. THE FRIDGE. The DOCTOR shivering.\nDOCTOR: Ambient temperature minus eight degrees Celsius.\nDOCTOR: He rubs his hands and blows his nails.\nDOCTOR: Must keep moving. I'll never be facetious about a strawberry mivvie\nDOCTOR: A sluggish electronic beep.\nDOCTOR: Ah. My little cybermatic friend. Still in hot pursuit - I use\nDOCTOR: the phrase advisedly. That'll teach Another beep.\nDOCTOR: Well, too cold to wriggle, eh?\nDOCTOR: Beep.\nDOCTOR: Let's see how sensitive your defences really are. Before\nDOCTOR: whoever sent you comes to collect.\nDOCTOR: 42b. THOMAS DODD'S SHOP Heavy banging at the door.\nDODD: All right, all right. Mind my door.\nDODD: More bangs. The window smashes and_ the door clatters open.\nDODD: tinkles down.\nPOLICEMAN: Thomas Dodd? You are harbouring a\nDODD: You took your time. He put up quite a struggle.”\nPOLICEMAN: Where is he?\nDODD: Gone. Out the back like the proverbial whippets of yore.”®\nPOLICEMAN: Search. Find the cold storage area. His cohort moves in, knocking things over. Pushing through curtain. Something smashes.\nDODD: Hang on! Where's your warrant?”\nDODD: The plastic-wrapped limbs are being pushed\nPOLICEMAN: Open this door.\nDODD: Leave that alone. It's highly specialised...\nPOLICEMAN: Open it.\nDODD: Oh, no you don't...\nDODD: The door seals gives. Hiss of escaping air.\nDOCTOR: Abh. How do you do? I'm the... stranger. So take me to\nDOCTOR: your\nPOLICEMAN: Destroy\nDOCTOR: Sorry. Not yet!\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR swings a _ load of metal sliding racks at _ the They collapse. He runs.\nPOLICEMAN: (Horribly calm) Stop him. Stop him...\nPOLICEMAN: again.\nPOLICEMAN: you.\nPOLICEMAN: The bell\nPOLICEMAN: stranger.\nPOLICEMAN: the chain\nPOLICEMAN: aside.\nPOLICEMAN: Cyberleader. him.\nPOLICEMAN: POLICEMAN.\nPOLICEMAN: 43. THE STREET. The DOCTOR comes dashing up.\nDOCTOR: (Breathless) Never a tram when you want one. Which\nDOCTOR: way? (Electronic snort of a horse) Ah.\nDOCTOR: The horse clops closer as the DOCTOR slams his pockets.\nDOCTOR: Clean out of sugar lumps. Hello... horse.\nDOCTOR: Snort again. The DOCTOR gasps as he's knocked sideways.\nDOCTOR: Out of fireworks too.\nDOCTOR: Fierce electronic whinny. The DOCTOR knocked down again.\nDOCTOR: (Winded) Temper. What's the matter? Bridle too tight? All\nDOCTOR: those implants biting into your head and your limbs? You have a_ hard life.\nDOCTOR: More electronic snorts punctuate his words.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The whips are cruel, the feed's old and stale. The stable\nDOCTOR: floor's hard under hoof. But if we get that bridle off, you can __ sleep properly. And dream. Dream like a _ real horse... wild, galloping where the ground's soft between the open sky and _ the sweet blowing _ grass. Beat. Furious whinny. A thud sends the DOCTOR reeling into a_ clattering dustbin. He's trapped as the horse rears over him with a_ series of fierce\nDOCTOR: shrieking neighs.\nALLAN: Stop! Captain! Call off your horse!\nPOLICEMAN: Stand down. Stand away. The horse stops its onslaught and withdraws a little.\nALLAN: I'm taking charge of the prisoner.\nALLAN: POLICEMAN The Committee instructed us...\nALLAN: (Fierce) I have powers to requisition prisoners for\nALLAN: medical research. Escort him to my unit.\nDOCTOR: How do you do? I'm much obliged to you.\nALLAN: Bring Dodd too. And have his filthy stock burnt. (Beat)\nALLAN: Smile, Captain. It's a holiday.\nDOCTOR: He can barely manage a rictus grin. That's the trouble\nDOCTOR: with too much plastic surgery.\nALLAN: Really? Take him away.\nALLAN: 44. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM. The Cybercanary tweeting. Rustle of tinsel.\nDAD: There we are. The front door opens.\nFRANK: (From hall) Dad? We're back. I've brought Nyssa.\nDAD: Kettles on, Frankie. What d'you’ reckon on _ the’ tree? Bit more tinsel? Happy holiday Nyssa.\nDAD: NYSSA And to you. I brought you some provisions.*!\nDAD: That's kind. I saw your friend. Seemed like an amiable\nDAD: chap.\nDAD: NYSSA The Doctor?\nDAD: DAD At Dodd's.\nFRANK: (Shocked) What were you doing there?\nDAD: Er... can't remember...\nNYSSA: Who's Dodd?\nFRANK: Bad news.\nNYSSA: Frank, I have to find the Doctor.\nDAD: (Worried) Ooh. Look, on the telly. What's that?\nFRANK: Dunno. Turn the sound up.\nFRANK: TV sound comes up with suitably heroic music.\nCOMMENTATOR: (Fading up) ...first time we can show you_ these outfits. Designed to protect courageous workers against the extreme freezing\nCOMMENTATOR: conditions on the surface in the propulsion factories...\nFRANK: (Over TV sound) Surface? They're not on the surface yet.\nCOMMENTATOR: (Under family)..Months of research have gone _ into the creation of these space-age marvels. Surgeon-General Doctorman\nCOMMENTATOR: Christine Allan, who designed the suits, is seen here’ being congratulated by Surface Commander Zheng...”\nDAD: (Over TV) Blimey, look at him. Talk about extreme. Poor\nDAD: old Vonnie. She won't like wearing those.\nNYSSA: (Horrified) They're not protection suits. Those are fully\nNYSSA: processed Cybermen.\nFRANK: Who?\nFRANK: The kettle in the kitchen starts to whistle.\nDAD: Kettle's boiling.\nDAD: The power pops off: The TV goes dead. The whistle dies. A distant boom like an explosion.\nNYSSA: What's happening!\nDAD: Oh. Power cut. Just when I got the lights up.\nDAD: Another much louder boom carries into...\nDAD: 45. COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING WARD. The boom. Hum of power dies.\nCONSTANT: Emergency generators! Get the back-up generators running!\nNURSE: Sister! It's cut out in mid-programming!\nNURSE: Alarm bell rings.\nNURSE: That's the evacuation.\nCONSTANT: (Formidable) No one leaves! No one! We hear the voices of Cybermen inarticulate and struggling.\nCONSTANT: Keep the recruits restrained. Their programming won't be\nCONSTANT: complete!\nCONSTANT: A power surge builds... and dies again. The alarm stops.\nCONSTANT: No power.\nCONSTANT: A snap of breaking restraint belts. Several people scream.\nCYRERMAN: What is my task?\nCYRERMAN: Something smashes. More belts snap. A babble of confused Cybermen’ - not in unified chorus.\nCYRERMEN: What is’ my _ task? I am_ required. I am_ required. What is my task? (And so on...)\nCONSTANT: Try to hold them back! Where's Doctorman Allan? A wailing scream of agony starts in the distance, gathers, echoing on_ the Tannoys all around them. In the wailing, the word ‘Zheng’ can _ be discerned.\nNURSE: What is it?\nCONSTANT: (Terrified) The Committee.\nCONSTANT: 46. THE CITY - ENTRANCE TO COMMITTEE PALACE.\nCONSTANT: Distant rumbling. Another boom. DODD and_ the DOCTOR being _ frog- marched along, accompanied by a = POLICEMAN _ on horseback. Horse neighs.\nDODD: (Breathless) What is it? Ow, my ears... DOCTOR The air pressure. Did you feel it drop?\nDODD: Thought the roof was coming in.\nDOCTOR: It may well do. What is it, officer? Are we under bombardment?\nPOLICEMAN: Keep moving.\nDODD: It's too dark to see.\nDODD: Another distant boom. The alarm inside can be heard.\nDOCTOR: That was away to the North.\nDOCTOR: Crowd of footsteps passing them.\nPOLICEMAN: Proceed through the Committee Palace gates.\nDODD: I'm not going in there.\nPOLICEMAN: Move on.\nPOLICEMAN: From ahead, to greet them, comes’ the wailing of the Committee. Gun shots can be heard too.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like your society's in its death throes.\nDOCTOR: Another boom - closer this time. Horse neighs again. Its hooves go all\nDOCTOR: over.\nDODD: More like the end of the world.\nDOCTOR: You could be right. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Mondas\nDOCTOR: doesn't have a future after all.\nDOCTOR: Crash theme.\nDOCTOR: PART TREE.\nDOCTOR: 46 (Cont.) THE CITY - ENTRANCE TO COMMITTEE PALACE. Distant rumbling. Another distant boom. The alarm inside can be heard.\nDOCTOR: That was away to the North.\nDOCTOR: Crowds of footsteps passing them.\nPOLICEMAN: Proceed through the Committee Palace gates.\nDODD: I'm not going in there.\nPOLICEMAN: Move on.\nPOLICEMAN: From ahead, to greet them, comes’ the wailing of the committee. Gun shots can be heard too.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like your society's in its death throes.\nDOCTOR: Another boom - closer this time. Horse neighs again. Its hooves go all\nDOCTOR: over.\nDODD: More like the end of the world.\nDOCTOR: You could be right. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Mondas\nDOCTOR: doesn't have a future after all.\nDOCTOR: Very large boom. The horse neighs. Debris falls around them. The\nPOLICEMAN: yells in pain and falls from his mount.\nDOCTOR: Quick, while he's on the ground! Run!\nDODD: Not that way!\nDOCTOR: You think you're better off on the streets? Come on,\nDOCTOR: inside the Palace!\nDOCTOR: Another boom.\nDOCTOR: 47, COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING WARD.\nDOCTOR: Wailing of the committee slowly dies to nothing. The distant rumble continues. Constant and her staff are trying to keep’ the _ half-processed Cybermen in check.\nCYBERMAN: We have tasks to perform.\nCONSTANT: (Spelling it out as if she's’ talking to a _ foreigner) You must stay here until the power returns.\nALLAN: (Arriving) Sisterman Constant? What's happening?\nCONSTANT: Oh, Doctorman Allan. Thank heaven. ALLAN The City's in darkness. There were explosions... Why are\nCONSTANT: these recruits here?\nCYBERMAN: Our tasks must be allocated.\nALLAN: What?\nCONSTANT: (Lowering voice) The power went down’ during their logic programming. We've been trying to contain them, but at _ least one's wandered off. They don't understand.\nALLAN: They wouldn't. They're barely out of processing.\nCYBERMAN: We do understand.\nALLAN: (Startled) Do you?\nCYBERMAN: Weare the future.\nALLAN: (Tentative) Yes?\nCYBERMAN: We have tasks to perform. What are they?\nALLAN: You must wait. Your programming is incomplete.\nALLAN: Waiting is your task.\nCYBERMAN: (Beat) We will wait.\nALLAN: Good. Very good. (Urgent whisper) What about the\nALLAN: Committee? Without power they'll die.\nCONSTANT: They went quiet. Everyone else fled. There's no word from\nCONSTANT: the work crews on the surface. And we can't leave here.\nALLAN: Then the Committee's in trouble.\nCYBERMAN: Our ffirst imperative is to protect the Committee. Where is the Committee? We must protect the Committee.\nALLAN: Your task is to wait.\nCYBERMAN: We _ have waited. If you threaten the Committee, we must destroy you.\nCYBERMAN: 48. COMMITTEE PALACE - ANTECHAMBER. Another more distant boom. The DOCTOR and DODD's voices echo in_ the huge room.\nDOCTOR: All clear, Thomas.\nDOCTOR: DODD The place is deserted.\nDOCTOR: Getting nippy too. Frost flowers on the windows. This\nDOCTOR: must have been a fine palace once, before it crumbled into baroque decay. Another distant boom.\nDODD: Yeah, well, I know it had a famous wine cellar. I could\nDODD: do with a drink right now. Are we under attack?\nDOCTOR: Worse. The outside's getting in. The energy fields of a local\nDOCTOR: nebula are playing merry hell with the _ integrity of the City's sealed\nDOCTOR: biosphere.\nDODD: Safer in here, then.”\nDOCTOR: Depends what's in here with us.\nDOCTOR: Beat.\nDODD: You reckon these statues are solid gold?\nDOCTOR: (Sigh) I give up. No, they're probably goldleaf. (He starts\nDOCTOR: scratching one) There. See? It just flakes off.\nDODD: Oil What about the market value?\nDOCTOR: What market? (Carries on scratching) It's the last place\nDOCTOR: I'd expect to find so much gold. Still, this could be a_ prudent investment. (Beat) So what did happen to your decadent rulers?\nDODD: Chop, chop, chop.\nDOCTOR: (Still scraping) Victims of the People's Committee, I take\nDOCTOR: it. And where are the champions of the Proletariat? I want to see the Committee for myself.\nDODD: No one sees the Committee.\nDOCTOR: I wonder why?\nDOCTOR: A door bangs open at the far end of the room. CYBERVONNE (in fact it's\nDOCTOR: processed YVONNE) approaches.\nDOCTOR: (Urgent hiss) Hide!\nCYBERVONNE: (Distant) What are my tasks?\nDODD: (Disbelief) What is it?”\nDOCTOR: Get down, Thomas.\nCYBERVONNE: (Approaching) Clarify my directives!\nDODD: It's horrible!\nDOCTOR: Doddl\nCYBERVONNE: You!\nDOCTOR: Too late. Yes? How can I help you?\nDODD: (Shocked) What Is that thing?\nCYBERVONNE: What are my tasks? I must know my tasks.\nDOCTOR: Your tasks? Don't you know?\nCYBERVONNE: (Closer) You must tell me. I must know.\nDODD: Don't you look at me!\nDOCTOR: What purpose were you created for?\nCYBERVONNE: CStuttering) I... I do not know.\nDODD: Horrible thing! Horrible cloth face!\nCYBERVONNE: Am I horrible?\nDODD: Bloody horrible!\nDOCTOR: Thomas!\nCYBERVONNE: I do not know this.\nDODD: It's all spare parts. All implants. Nothing human left!*’\nDOCTOR: Who were you? Do you remember?\nCYBERVONNE: I am... I...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nCYBERVONNE: Father must see my uniform. Father... North District Block Nine. (Moving away) Apartment Thirty One.\nDOCTOR: Appalling waste.\nDODD: Is that what they're doing in here?\nDOCTOR: So even you're shocked, Thomas. That's good.\nDODD: Disgusting. Stank of antiseptic.”\nDOCTOR: They've always done that.\nDODD: Male or female? Couldn't even tell.\nDOCTOR: Primitive. Genderless. Confused. And still cabled up. Must have been fresh from processing.\nDODD: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: It's your destiny, Thomas. It was a Cyberman.\nDOCTOR: 49. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR. NYSSA, FRANK and DAD staring out into’ the dark _ street. moaning gently.\nNYSSA: It's snowing.\nDAD: Snow? But that's weather. We don't have weather\nDAD: anymore, Nyssa. That's what they'd've’ called = a__ blizzard,\nNYSSA: There must be a breach in the cavern roof. How deep\nNYSSA: below the frozen surface are we?”\nFRANK: They were tunnelling for the surface.”' In those suited-up\nFRANK: things we saw on the telly.\nFRANK: NYSSA The Cybermen.\nFRANK: Maybe they caused this...\nDAD: Beautiful, ain't it?” Just in time for the holiday. All the\nDAD: tiny flakes catching in the torchlight.\nFRANK: Dad, we're wasting the torch. Come in. You'll freeze.\nFRANK: The door closes, cutting out the\nNYSSA: I must find the Doctor. He'll do something.\nFRANK: About the weather?\nDAD: It's getting worse. You'll not even get across the street to\nDAD: the phone booth in this.”\nNYSSA: I must go. The streets could soon be impassable.\nNYSSA: A\nNYSSA: am...\nNYSSA: wind is years ago. wind.\nFRANK: I'll find you a coat.\nDAD: You're daft, both of you. I'm putting the kettle on.\nFRANK: Dad...\nDAD: Oh, right. No power. No tea. I reckon our Vonnie's better\nDAD: off up there in barracks.\nDAD: 50. COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING WARD. ALLAN, CONSTANT and staff surrounded by CYBERMEN.\nALLAN: Let us out. We have to reach the Committee Chamber.\nCYRERMAN: Doctorman Allan, we are protecting the Committee.\nCONSTANT: (Angry) You're nowhere near the Committee!\nCYRERMAN: Displays of emotional weakness are impractical.\nCYRERMAN: ALLAN The Committee will be dead if you don't’ release us! And the City too. (Beat) I'm going to try and_ get the’ generators restarted.” Beat.\nCYRERMAN: Agreed. One of us will escort you.\nALLAN: He doesn't trust me.\nCONSTANT: (Muttering) Don't argue, doctorman. I'll keep the others busy.\nCONSTANT: Beat.\nALLAN: (Genuine concern) Be careful, Constant.\nCONSTANT: Heaven bless you. Here, take my scarf. And hurry, before we all freeze to death.\nCONSTANT: 51. COMMITTEE PALACE - CORRIDOR. The DOCTOR and DODD searching rooms. Door opens.\nDODD: Nothing in here. I think we're lost, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (Distant) Thomas, you'd better come and see.\nDODD: Strewth, it's cold. Even my icicles've got icic... (Beat)\nDODD: BUmey, what are those...?\nDOCTOR: Racks of body containment suits for Cybermen. All ready\nDOCTOR: for processing on an_ industrial scale. Things are more advanced than I expected.\nDODD: See what state-funding does? That's me out of business.\nDODD: See you later, Doctor!”°\nDOCTOR: Thomas! Come back!\nDODD: (Moving away) No, I've had enough. I'm going home,\nDODD: away from this... this place!\nDOCTOR: Thomas!\nDOCTOR: A distant door sounds. ALLAN and her CYBERMAN approach.\nCYRERMAN: Which way are the generators?\nALLAN: You have a new task. Stay here and guard the way. It's\nALLAN: quicker if I work alone.\nCYRERMAN: I must escort you.\nALLAN: My arm! (In pain) Let go!\nCYRERMAN: I must escort you.\nDOCTOR: Let her go!\nALLAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Stand down. I warn you, I'm armed!\nCYRERMAN: You are interfering with my task.\nDOCTOR: Am I? Have some goldleaf.\nDOCTOR: He puffs it at the CYBEKMEN.\nALLAN: (Incredulous) What are you doing? Beat.\nDOCTOR: Well? Well, go on. Choke and fall over.\nCYBERMAN: Is this a threat?\nDOCTOR: Apparently not. My apologies.\nCYBERMAN: This is a threat.\nCYBERMAN: The DOCTOR cries out as the CYBERMAN grabs his throat.\nCYBERMAN: All threats must be anulled.\nDOCTOR: (Choking) I came to help!\nALLAN: Get away from him!\nCYBERMAN: All threats must be anulled.\nDOCTOR: City... in danger...”\nALLAN: I said, let him go!” The DOCTOR gives a strangulated croak.\nALLAN: Do as you're told!\nALLAN: Electric buzz. The CYBERMAN cries out and collapses.\nDOCTOR: (Gasping) Thank you.\nALLAN: (In shock) I had to abort him. He'd have killed you. I don't take these decisions lightly.\nDOCTOR: No doctor does. But how did you...?\nALLAN: Failsafe override. It only works during processing. D6CTOR So the processing was incomplete. (Alarm) Careful!\nALLAN: I'm closing his eyes. He was a human being too. Barely reborn.\nDOCTOR: It's a Cyberman. The human part is debatable. How many more are there like it?\nALLAN: I have to restore the power generators. (Beat) Where's your police guard?\nDOCTOR: Hit by falling rubble. I came in voluntarily. If you'll trust me, I can help.\nALLAN: (Beat) I don't trust you. But I've no choice, have I? This Way...\nALLAN: 52. CITY STREET. NYSSA and FRANK outside the TARDIS. The wind moaning. NYSSA banging on the door. Both are bitterly cold.\nNYSSA: Doctor! Let us into the TARDIS! It's freezing out here! Beat.\nFRANK: Not there, is he?\nNYSSA: No.\nFRANK: So now what?\nFRANK: NYSSA The Committee Palace. If that's the centre of things, that's where the Doctor would head for.\nFRANK: That's where Yvonne went.\nNYSSA: Then we can find her too. How far is it?\nFRANK: It's dark. We can cut across the square by the holiday tree.\nNYSSA: (Sharp) Frank, put the torch out!\nFRANK: What?\nFRANK: is\nNYSSA: Lights. Coming this way.\nFRANK: It's the police. NYSSA On those horse things. We'll never get past them.\nFRANK: Right. Back home. We'll pick up more batteries, and try\nFRANK: the other way round.\nFRANK: 53. COMMITTEE PALACE - GENERATOR PLANT. Heavy creaking door. The DOCTOR and ALLAN. Their footsteps sound on the stone floor.\nFRANK: ALLAN In here. This is the generator chamber.\nDOCTOR: Impressive. You're producing energy on a vast scale.\nALLAN: When it's working.\nDOCTOR: Geothermal power, yes? Dry steam to drive the turbines,\nDOCTOR: pumped up from the centre of the planet. You could power a_ hundred cities with this.\nALLAN: tears off a sheet of paper.\nALLAN: These print outs. Every failsafe has activated.\nDOCTOR: Let's see. (Studying) Oh, yes. Someone's been making\nDOCTOR: huge demands on the power. It's blown every fuse.\nALLAN: (Despair) I'm not an electriman. I'd hoped to just throw a\nALLAN: switch and get the power on again.\nDOCTOR: Time's already running out. Your planet's errant path is\nDOCTOR: wandering into the region of the Cherrybowl Nebula.\nALLAN: How can you know that?\nDOCTOR: Space-farers avoid it like the plague. It's a crucible of\nDOCTOR: unstable primal energy. And it'll rip this planet apart if you go too close.” The turbulence has already punctured the _ sealed biosphere of the _ City.\nALLAN: Who exactly are you?\nDOCTOR: I want to help. For the sake of the people freezing outside. ALLAN And the Committee.\nDOCTOR: I didn't think Cybermen allowed committees.\nALLAN: It'll die if ] don't get its power back on.\nDOCTOR: It? You mean, one entity?\nALLAN: We'll all be dead without it!\nDOCTOR: So where is it? (Sets off) What's in here?\nALLAN: No!\nALLAN: He pushes the door straight through to Scene 54.\nALLAN: 54. COMMITTEE CHAMBER. Footsteps echo in the huge empty chamber. Very resonant.\nDOCTOR: (Flat) Empty...\nALLAN: I told you to stay out.\nDOCTOR: No one sees the Committee. Is this why? (Shouts) Hello! It echoes around.\nALLAN: You have no right.\nALLAN: DOCTOR The secret's out, Doctor Allan. Your Committee's a sham.\nALLAN: It doesn't exist. The rotten apple has no core. Clang of metal plates. A rumbling.\nDOCTOR: What's that?\nALLAN: It's alive. The Committee. It's still alive!\nALLAN: 55. COMMITTEE PALACE - PROCESSING WARD. CONSTANT and the semi-processed CYBERMEN.\nCYBERMAN: Sisterman, we can wait no longer.\nCONSTANT: Give Doctorman Allan time.\nCYBERMAN: Stay where you are.\nCONSTANT: Unlike you, I'm not resistant to cold. I need food and_ the toilets. And warmer clothes.\nCYBERMAN: That is weakness. You should become like us.\nCONSTANT: You’ were’ chosen’ for a_ purpose. I _ still have a _ choice. The Cybercrows starts to mumble, ‘Purpose? She knows our _ purpose? She must tell us.'\nCYBERMAN: Ifyou know our purpose and our tasks, you must tell us.\nCONSTANT: [don't know!\nCYBERMAN: It is imperative.\nCONSTANT: cries out in pain.\nCYBERMAN: We must know.\nCONSTANT: is gasping in agony. A door crashes open. COMMANDER ZHENG and his squad have arrived. ZHENG'S’ voice is darker. He emanates power.\nZHENG: Stand away. I am Cybercommander Zheng. My squad is\nZHENG: assuming control here. Release the Sisterman.\nCYBERMAN: Data is_ being’ withheld. We must access’ the _ information.\nZHENG: Release the Sisterman.\nZHENG: A laser bolt. The CYBERMAN collapses with a groan.\nCONSTANT: (In some pain) How’ dare’ you bring’ violence’ into the wards! Every life is precious here.\nCYBERMEN: (Variously) Data is being withheld We protect the Committee We have no other directives.\nZHENG: Return to your tasks.\nCONSTANT: They're recruits. The power cut out before their programming was complete. They know no better.\nZHENG: (To his CYBERMEN) Squad. Escort these recruits back to\nZHENG: the processing section.\nZHENG: Movement as the Cyberguards shepherd the recruits away.\nZHENG: Sisterman Constant, you are hurt?\nCONSTANT: I'm fine. I must see to my other patients.\nZHENG: I was summoned from the surface. Lack of power disabled\nZHENG: my transporter. I must report to the Committee.\nCONSTANT: What's happened? Are we under attack?\nZHENG: That is secure information. Why has the power not been\nZHENG: restored?\nCONSTANT: All the other staff have gone. It's chaos here.\nZHENG: Cybermen would not desert their posts. Is the Committee\nZHENG: secure?\nCONSTANT: Doctor Allan is trying to reach them.\nZHENG: You are damaged.\nCONSTANT: My shoulder. It's nothing. Ow! Let go! ZHENG The scapula is fractured.\nCONSTANT: (in_ great’ pain) I _ said, it's nothing! What about the Innocent recruit you shot?\nZHENG: He will be taken for reassembly. So will you. (To his\nZHENG: minions) Take them both.\nCONSTANT: ‘Take your hands off me! (Being dragged of) No! I. will not go.”” I will not go!\nZHENG: Resistance will not be tolerated.\nZHENG: SCENE 56. COMMITTEE CHAMBER. Iron plates’ clang. An_ edifice rumbles and clanks’ near. An_ iron lung heaves slowly up and down. Chains rattle. Feed pipes gurgle.\nDOCTOR: (Appalled) Is this your Committee? A primitive many-\nDOCTOR: headed cybernetic hydra?\nALLAN: It's still alive. Running on vestigial power.\nDOCTOR: It's obscene! It's devouring every resource you have. No\nDOCTOR: wonder the City's still stuck in the nineteen-fifties.\nALLAN: Twenty of our greatest minds joined as one to descry\nALLAN: clear solutions to our problems. (To Committee) It's Doctorman Allan. Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: Pontificating like some monstrous tinpot Solomon. You still think of them as human, don't you?\nALLAN: Help me get the power back on.\nDOCTOR: Look at it. Is that human? Swollen heads wired into the system; disregarded bodies withering like rotten fruit. If I chop’ off one head, do two more sprout in its place? You know where it'll lead, don't\nDOCTOR: you?\nDOCTOR: The door slams open. ZHENG enters.\nZHENG: Doctorman Allan? Why is the power not restored?\nALLAN: (Brusque to mask her fear) Cybercommander Zheng. The Committee is still alive.\nZHENG: And?\nZHENG: ALLAN The failsafes prevented any serious damage.\nDOCTOR: More's the pity.\nZHENG: Who is this? Give his name.\nALLAN: (Unsure) He's...\nDOCTOR: How do you do? I'm the doctorman's assistant.\nALLAN: My what?\nDOCTOR: Every doctor should have one.\nZHENG: Name?\nZHENG: DOCTOR And I'm here to restore the generators. No one else has the know-how.\nZHENG: Is this true?\nZHENG: Beat.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS (Feeble whisper) Doctorman Allan...\nALLAN: (Relief) Yes... I hear you... Are you sale?\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS~ The processing. Have you... found a __ solution?\nALLAN: We're doing all we can.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Utmost... priority. Little time... left. Restore the power.\nALLAN: We're working on it. Come on, Doctor.\nZHENG: Doctor?\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS Zheng... Report the status... on the — surface... Zheng...\nALLAN: (Muttering) Come on.\nDOCTOR: Don't you want to hear?\nZHENG: Storm radiation intensity has increased two hundred and thirty per cent. Endurance levels have been met. Final tests on the propulsion system were curtailed by the power loss.\nZHENG: DOCTOR A propulsion system. For the planet I assume.\nALLAN: Doctor, come away.\nALLAN: They go through the doors. Straight into Scene 57.\nALLAN: 57. GENERATOR PLANT.\nDOCTOR: (Excited) That's the reason, isn't it? You've built a\nDOCTOR: propulsion system on the surface. But conditions are so_ severe only workers with fully augmented bodies can _ survive. That's created the Cybermen.\nDOCTOR: ALLAN And now those conditions are extending into the City.\nDOCTOR: So no power; no people; no anything. ALLAN And Mondas will soon be a dead world.\nDOCTOR: 58. STREET OUTSIDE THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT. NYSSA and FRANK at the front door. The wind moans.\nNYSSA: (Shivering) Surely it can't get colder.\nNYSSA: FRANK The lock's frozen.\nNYSSA: He pummels the door.\nFRANK: Dad! Dad, it's us! Open up!\nFRANK: Distant cluttering - hundreds of Cybermats approaching.\nNYSSA: Something's coming!\nFRANK: Dad! Let us in!\nFRANK: He bangs the door again. The cluttering is much\nNYSSA: Cybermats! Hundreds of them!”\nFRANK: They're swarming. Dad!\nFRANK: The door opens.\nDAD: Steady on. Remember the neighbours.\nFRANK: (As he and NYSSA barge past) Shut the door!\nDAD: Flaming heck! Where's my cheeser and traps?\nDAD: A moment as they watch the mass swarming\nNYSSA: They're not interested in us.\nDAD: Something's spooked them.\nDAD: The chittering fades. But now we hear the distant voice of a Gyberman is pursuit. (It's CYBERVONNE, distressed and making inarticulate urk- arg noises.)\nFRANK: Look!\nNYSSA: It's a Cyberman!\nFRANK: Get inside!\nFRANK: up why\nFRANK: The door slams. We're inside too. We _ hear the  urk-arging approach\nFRANK: stop outside.\nFRANK: It'll go past. It didn't see us.\nFRANK: The wood panelling smashes. CYBERVONNE makes arg cries.\nDAD: Get back!\nDAD: there, you\nDAD: closer.\nDAD: past.\nDAD: and\nDAD: 59. COMMITTEE PALACE - GENERATOR ROOM.\nDOCTOR: ALLAN and the DOCTOR working.\nALLAN: Doctor? What's it like under there?\nALLAN: The DOCTOR pulls himself out from under a unit.\nALLAN: DOCTOR The traction routes are burnt right out. I'm going to try and close the circuits manually.\nALLAN: Then the pumps will start to feed the heat exchangers\nALLAN: again.\nDOCTOR: Pass me that rod. I'll have to try to use brute force.\nALLAN: lifts a heavy metal object.\nALLAN: Here.\nDOCTOR: (Exerting pressure) This is only temporary, you realise.\nALLAN: Yes.\nALLAN: A loud clunk as the circuit closes.\nDOCTOR: That's the first one closed. But the only real solution is to\nDOCTOR: pull Mondas's course away from the nebula.\nDOCTOR: ZHENG The propulsion system on the surface is the Committee's\nDOCTOR: prime objective.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Commander Zheng. Back from your pow wow?\nZHENG: Continue with your work.\nDOCTOR: (Exerting pressure again) I knew these generators\nDOCTOR: supplied more than the City. (Another clunk) Second circuit closed. Eight to go.\nZHENG: Doctorman Allan, this man is an alien intruder.\nALLAN: Yes, but I've requisitioned him. So hands off.\nZHENG: How did he enter the City?\nALLAN: I don't care. He's helping us.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. Just how complete is the propulsion system?\nDOCTOR: Completely complete? Or only a bit?\nZHENG: It is complete.\nDOCTOR: So why...?\nDOCTOR: ALLAN The number of engineers is limited, Doctor. It involves\nDOCTOR: colossal energies...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And only Cyberprocessed workers can undertake the\nDOCTOR: task. (Exerts pressure) What's the survival rate?\nZHENG: That is not your concern.\nZHENG: Clunk.\nALLAN: (Ashamed) It's nineteen per cent.\nDOCTOR: So you keep processing more and more innocent people.\nALLAN: Without the Cybermen, we cannot survive.*” They are our\nALLAN: saviours.\nDOCTOR: Him? A saviour? You're trapped, all of you! (Exerts\nDOCTOR: pressure again) Your future... is inescapable.\nZHENG: Weare the future.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. (Another clunk) Pour down. Six nails in the coffin to go.\nDOCTOR: 60. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT. A splintering of wood as CYBERVONNE forces her way in.\nDAD: Get back. It's coming through!\nDAD: The door crashes open.\nFRANK: Look out, Nyssa!\nDAD: It's half crazy. What's it want? Leave us alone, you!\nCYBERVONNE: gives a low moaning wail.\nFRANK: It's one of those surface crewmen.\nNYSSA: It's a Cyberman.\nNYSSA: A moment's silence. Then CYBERVONNE moans again.\nDAD: Sounds distressed to me.**\nNYSSA: It can't be. They have no feelings.\nDAD: Let's have a look.\nFRANK: Careful, Dad!\nNYSSA: Keep back.\nDAD: (Gently) Now then in there, what's all the fuss?\nCYBERVONNE: (Trying to articulate) Da... D...a...\nDAD: What's that?\nCYBERVONNE: D.. D... (Long drawn out) Daaaad.\nDAD: moans.\nFRANK: Oh, no...\nCYBERVONNE: Daaaad...\nDAD: (Stunned) Yvonne? Is that you? What have they done to\nDAD: you? I can't see your face. And _ they've made you so tall. Oh, my little Vonnie... Let's get this horrid mask off...\nDAD: As he tries to do so, CYBERVONNE cries out in anger and brings down a hefty cyberchop on something that smashes violently.\nDAD: 61. GENERATOR ROOM. The DOCTOR, ALLAN and ZHENG. Clunk as circuit closes.\nDOCTOR: Two circuits left.\nALLAN: Keep going, Doctor.\nALLAN: DOCTOR And what happens when I've got the power back up? ZHENG The Committee will restore order.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. First power goes down to the City.\nDOCTOR: ZHENG The Committee will be first.\nDOCTOR: ALLAN The Doctor's right, Zheng.\nDOCTOR: Agree, Commander. Or I'll smash every logic junction (exerts pressure) and circuit in the place. (The circuit clunks closed) One more to go. Or not. It's up to you.\nALLAN: Zheng. The City must come first. You must agree,\nALLAN: Commander!\nALLAN: Beat.\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS (Hoarse whisper) It 18s agreed.\nDOCTOR: Ah, your master's voice, Zheng. Agree to everything now!\nCOMMITTEE: CHORUS The City comes... first.\nALLAN: Thank you.™\nDOCTOR: Right. Once this is closed you can throw the power switch.\nDOCTOR: He tries effortfully to lever the circuit closed.\nALLAN: What is it?\nDOCTOR: (Struggling) It's jammed! Hang on. If I can force them\nDOCTOR: together... (He exerts repeated pressure)\nALLAN: Zheng! Don't touch the switch!\nZHENG: throws the switch. A fierce electrical crack and buzz as the\nZHENG: DOCTOR’ takes the full force of the current. His scream of thrown right across the speakers. The circuit clunks shut.

Ooh, your hands are frozen.\nFRANK: It's horrible. Is that really her?\nDAD: Now remember what it all means, eh? Our dear old,\nDAD: scraggy old tree stands for the forests that once covered the\nDAD: surface of\nDAD: the world. The lights are the stars above the stone sky.

(Drifting off) Thank you.\nZHENG: (Returning) Doctorman Allan.\nALLAN: Zheng, help me with him.\nZHENG: Why?\nALLAN: (Calm, still) Look at him. The Doctor took the force of the\nALLAN: entire power supply, but he's still alive. He's hardly burned. Even you couldn't do that.\nZHENG: High resilience.\nALLAN: Don't you understand? This is incredible. I need a full\nALLAN: corporeal diagnostic. If his physiology can stand up to that’ shock, he could be the answer to our prayers.\nALLAN: 65. THE HARTLEYS' APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM.

Anything to encourage oblivion.\nALLAN: She starts pouring a drink.\nNYSSA: Please, listen to me!\nNYSSA: The glass smashes.\nALLAN: You stupid little...\nNYSSA: He's gone. The Doctor's dead! Adric's dead! So many people killed because of your Cybermen.”\nNYSSA: ALLAN The Doctor was a gift. I knew I was right. I should thank him. He was our last The door slides open.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. You make me sound like Southend-on-Sea.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Just about. Yes.\nNYSSA: (Hugging him) Oh, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I could hear you right up the corridor.\nNYSSA: I thought they'd taken you.

If we add something weaken its resolve...\nDOCTOR: ALLAN The Cybermen hold all the medical stores.\nDOCTOR: Well, there must be something.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the wine.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Nyssa, you are incomparable! Wine from the old regime, I assume? How much is left?\nALLAN: They're my bottles... My cellar...\nALLAN: DOCTOR A few bottles or the whole planet?

It's coming in!\nDAD: Everybody! Inside! Run!\nDAD: Tremendous roar as part of the roof implodes.\nDAD: 87. THE NUTRIENT VATS. Distant windows smashing in. The roar of ice continues _ outside. DOCTOR, NYSSA and ALLAN push a trolley with clinking bottles.\nDAD: ALLAN The City roof's breaking up!\nDOCTOR: Then keep your head down. Right Nyssa, I'll open the wine bottles. You empty them into the vats.\nDOCTOR: Slow churning of the nutrient vats.\nNYSSA: What is that stuff in there?\nDOCTOR: Nutrient for the Committee. Rich in calcium.\nALLAN: You can't stop them like that!\nDOCTOR: But a Mickey Finn might slow them up a bit.\nALLAN: Give me that bottle! I should never have let you near all this!\"°?

The DOCTOR pulls another cork.\nDOCTOR: We are threatening her children. Mmm, blackberry and\nDOCTOR: aniseed.\nNYSSA: We can't just destroy a whole race.\nNYSSA: DOCTOR A race reborn partly in my image. I feel it's my right to\nNYSSA: try and redirect its evolution. Keep pouring.\nNYSSA: Pulls another cork. NYSSA starts pouring another bottle.\nNYSSA: Doctor, if Cybermen are the only way these people can survive...\nDOCTOR: Is it the only way?\nNYSSA: I thought we couldn't change history.\nDOCTOR: This place. All decay and despair. It feels like an end. Yet you and I know what's coming afterwards. So it's not an ending. Just an\nDOCTOR: alternative.\nNYSSA: So we can't change history.\nDOCTOR: Who says? I think history's old enough to take care of\nDOCTOR: Itself, don't you? Just keep pouring. She pours.\nDOCTOR: 88. COMMUNICATOR CONSOLE.\nZHENG: speaks to the _ propulsion base on the _ surface.

He's trying to poison...\nZHENG: Which is more important? The Committee? Or the planet?\nALLAN: What? Well, that's obvious. Only the Committee have the power to save us. (Seat) My Committee.\nZHENG: You are wrong. Stand aside.\nALLAN: No, wait! (Following him) The Committee must be warned.\nALLAN: Just listen... A door creaks open as DAD and FRANK emerge from hiding.\nFRANK: (Relief) Thought they'd got us then, Dad.\nDAD: Horrible place. Horrible plastic suits on racks. Forcing my little Vonnie into one of them.\nFRANK: That woman was on the telly.\nFRANK: DAD And the big robo too. They were heading for the Committee.\nFRANK: But she said the Doctor.\nDAD: What? Nyssa's friend?\nFRANK: She came the other way. Maybe Nyssa's there too.\nFRANK: 89. THE NUTRIENT VATS. The churning vats. NYSSA empties her last bottle.\nDOCTOR: Good. That's enough wine to stew a herd of boeuf\nDOCTOR: bourgignon.\nNYSSA: So we wait? (Goes to window) Look out there.\nNYSSA: We hear the wind and rumble of the bombardment above.\nNYSSA: (Frightened) Half the city's gone.\nDOCTOR: Buried under the glacier. We must change Mondas's course. It might ride out one tsunami, but not an endless blitz of them.\nNYSSA: (Seeing the CYBERMAN) Doctor...\nNYSSA: CYBERMAN'~ (Behind them) All _ civilians are required for processing.\nDOCTOR: But we're not civilians. Take us to the Committee. I want\nDOCTOR: a word...\nCYBERMAN: (Moving in) You are required for processing. The DOCTOR cries out as he is grabbed.\nNYSSA: Let go of him!\nNYSSA: But NYSSA gets grabbed too. Gasp! They resist loudly.\nCYBERMAN: Do not resist. You are required. A loud clunk as _ the CYBERMAN’ gets’ clobbered from behind. It groans\nCYBERMAN: and staggers.\nDAD: Frank! Tackle his legs! Get him into the vat!\nFRANK: (Struggling) Can't hold him!\nDOCTOR: I've got him!\nDAD: Right. And lift. Okay, jug ears. Over the top you go!\nDAD: The CYBERMAN cyberyells as it hurtles inevitably into the churning vat. The churning grates and chews gratifyingly.\nFRANK: Nyssa! Are you hurt?\nNYSSA: No. Frank, this is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hello again, Frank. And Mr Hartley?'” Nyssa told me about your daughter. I'm truly sorry.\nDAD: We're putting a stop to all this.\nDOCTOR: Absolutely.\nDAD: So what are we waiting for? Football results?\nDOCTOR: It's the Committee we're after.

In the courtyard.\nFRANK: From down below, we hear the marching of Cybertroops. A distant Cyber sergeant-major yells orders to halt and _ continues to put _ the platoon through its paces.\nNYSSA: Cybertroops. So many. It's a whole army.\nFRANK: They're processing everyone. Us too, soon.\nNYSSA: We must warn the Doctor. Come on... (Cut short)\nNYSSA: Menacing chord.\nCYBERMAN: (Very close) You’ will come with me.

Hum of the generators.\nDAD: I've never seen the like of these generators, Doctor. You could boil a million kettles all at once.\nDOCTOR: It could propel a whole planet. Unfortunately the power's\nDOCTOR: being diverted for other purposes.\nDAD: Any ideas?\nDOCTOR: Several. But we'd have to get past that guard first.\nALLAN: (Distant, in the Committee Chamber) Why don't you\nALLAN: listen? Deactivate your feed lines!\nDAD: Someone's having a bit of a barney.\nDOCTOR: Fighting a losing battle, I'd say.\nDOCTOR: g1. COMMITTEE CHAMBER.

I've come to complain about a_ leaky roof.\nCYBERMAN: Intruder.\nDOCTOR: That's right.\nDOCTOR: Swoosh of a Cyberchop.\nDOCTOR: (Dodging round) I have vital information...\nDOCTOR: Swoosh. A chair clatters across the floor.\nDOCTOR: ..about a threat to the Committee! Thunk of metal.\nDOCTOR: But I won't tell you!\nDOCTOR: Smashing wood.\nDOCTOR: You're far too clever for that...\nDOCTOR: The CYBERMAN grabs him. He cries out in pain.

(Laughs) No escape for any of us, is there?\nFRANK: It's her. From the telly.\nALLAN: What do you want? An autograph? God, it's cold down\nALLAN: here. Where's the Doctor? Off on another of his schemes, like the wine? NYSSA The Doctor's trying to save you.\nALLAN: Oh, do be quiet.\nFRANK: You started this. You started all the processing. If it\nFRANK: wasn't for you, my sister...! He yells as a CYBERMAN grabs him.\nCYBERMAN: Stay in line for processing.\nFRANK: (Falling back in pain) My shoulder. Ow!\nALLAN: Don't worry.

We survive as Cyberhumans.\nDOCTOR: I like humans a lot. But I don't like you.\nDOCTOR: A tremendous boom and explosion outside.\nDOCTOR: ZHENG The Doctor's logic is correct. Processing later. The propulsion system must be used now.\nCYBERPLANNER: Stand away from the power junctions.\nCYBERPLANNER: It _ fires off a shot at ZHENG, who cries and falls back.\nDOCTOR: Zheng!\nZHENG: (Weakened) We must... survive. Cybermen are superior.\nCYBERPLANNER: We will survive.\nDOCTOR: Fat chance! You were doomed the moment Mondas went\nDOCTOR: out of its orbit.\nCYBERPLANNER: (Speech starts slurring) When Mondas's orbit lost stability, our  sciencemen’ discovered an opposing twin world hidden until then behind our sun.\nDOCTOR: That's the wine talking.

It helps me think.\nNYSSA: I've worked out those projections.\nDOCTOR: Let's see.\nDOCTOR: He takes a piece of paper from her.\nNYSSA: You were right. Mondas is now moving on a reverse trajectory. Away from the Cherrybowl Nebula.\nDOCTOR: It's on its return journey. Back home from the edge of\nDOCTOR: space.\nNYSSA: Hardly that far.\nDOCTOR: Star charts are relative, you know, like Time. (Sighs) Too\nDOCTOR: many dead. And it didn't help Adric, did it?\nNYSSA: But did it help you?\nDOCTOR: Or you, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Maybe. It depends how much has changed.\nNYSSA: DOCTOR The Cybermen would have happened sooner or later. The\nNYSSA: nebula was just a good excuse.\nNYSSA: NYSSA At least we got rid of the Committee. And Zheng too. Even\nNYSSA: if the other Cybermen are still here.\nDOCTOR: Maybe they'll turn out as instruments for good after all.\nDOCTOR: If they and the humans can learn to live together. And they are doing a good job on the City roof. No human could do that.\nNYSSA: It's already warming up.\nCYBERMAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Is that you, Thomas Dodd? You really should wear a\nDOCTOR: label, you know. (To NYSSA) Tragic waste. The old unprocessed Thomas, who I couldn't trust, was infinitely preferable.\nCYBERMAN: My _ programming does not encompass’. deceit, Doctor. You\nCYBERMAN: are requested to supervise the reconstruction work.\nDOCTOR: No, no, Thomas. That's very kind. But we must be going.\nDAD: (Coming up) Going? You can't go, Doctor.

I'm sure you can cope.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA The Doctor prefers to deal with the grand scheme rather\nDOCTOR: than the day to day details.\nFRANK: Told you, Dad. Take no notice, Doctor. He'll do it brilliantly\nFRANK: himself.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure.\nDAD: Now I've no vermin to catch.\nDOCTOR: Where's Doctor Allan?\nDAD: Working. She reckons she can reverse at least some of the\nDAD: processing. Make them a bit less... well...

Silurians, as Derbyshire's oldest residents, don't count as invaders.'\nNOTES: 3. Line changed to: 'No. No, not for certain.\nNOTES: 4. Line changed to: \"You got the net?’\nNOTES: 5. Line changed to: 'It's no good.'\nNOTES: 6. Line changed to: 'Well, you won't catch a tram and go _ \"exploring\"\nNOTES: from round here at this time at this time of night. There's no more trams until the morning.’\nNOTES: 7. Line changed to: 'We've got a lot of doctors round here already.’\nNOTES: 8. Line changed to: \"You got any family?’ Marc Platt: 'Dodd's fishing to see if anyone will try to trace the Doctor if he suddenly disappears. But the Doctor's response about carelessly losing his family might be another distant reference to my Doctor Who novel Lungbarrow. Or it could be to his other family, the companions, none of whom stay for long. The line's echoed by Nyssa's family memories later on. It also bolsters up the importance of tine Hartley family and how all families will soon be a thing of the past on Mondas.'\nNOTES: 9. Line changed to: 'You're certainly not the Police.’\nNOTES: 10. Line changed to: 'How-e about a glass or three?’\nNOTES: 11. Line changed to: 'Of course it is. Where have you been?’\nNOTES: 12. line changed to: 'I was standing up before you knocked me down... thank you, officer.’\nNOTES: 13. Line changed to: 'Eric Krailford says that...' Marc Platt: 'Eric Krailford is\nNOTES: apparently some forebear of the Cyberman Krail in The Tenth Planet.’ 14. Line changed to: 'She were crying 'cos Eric's gone and...’\nNOTES: 15. Line changed to: (Superior) Logic and cybernetics.’\nNOTES: 16. The whistle comes before, 'Come on, Trillerby.'\nNOTES: 17. WOMAN'S line does not begin until after DAD's \"Turn on the telly.’ The line then runs under the other dialogue until the script specifies that it fades.\nNOTES: 18. Dialogue that can be heard from the television: '...Committee. At this time, our holiday. We send our thanks to the-'\nNOTES: 19. Line changed to: 'Must be the Police.’\nNOTES: 20. Line changed to: 'Something's going on under the cover of darkness.’\nNOTES: 21. Line changed to: 'Aye, well, maybe it has seen better days.'\nNOTES: 22. Added dialogue - PRANK: 'Awww.'\nNOTES: 23. \"Yeah,' added at the beginning of the line.\nNOTES: 24. Line changed to: 'And the people would sing at the gates. I used to\nNOTES: love that. And then we' d have the battle. People and consuls pelting each other with fruit. That was the best bit - it was so undignified.’ Marc Platt: 'WARNING - Saccharine alert! The last part of this speech got added very late on. Traken was such a lovely place, full of nice people being kind and considerate, I realised that the occasional bit of disrespect, at the right time and place naturally, would make the place a lot more real.'\nNOTES: 25. Line changed to: 'The mats that get away and go wild.’\nNOTES: 26. Line changed to: 'Why? What else could they possibly be...’\nNOTES: 27. Deleted dialogue - DAD: ‘What's that?’\nNOTES: 28. The door slams after DAD has said, 'Frank!’\nNOTES: 29. Line changed to: 'It's disgusting, that's what it is.'\nNOTES: 30. The conversation fades down during POLICEMAN'S next line.\nNOTES: 31. Line changed to: ‘Stand aside, sir! Whatever happened to civil rights!\nNOTES: Here, leave that alone, you! In—the—old—days,—you—had_te—have—a—special__warrant from—__the—_pelice —-station.—_Noewadays—_the—_blooming —Central__Committee—_juot\nNOTES: i Mind that vase!’ Scene 18 then begins. Gary Russell (director): 'I don't think the reference to \"bloomin' Central Committee\" would have worked. It sounds more like a line from a Carry On movie. Which is ironic as Marc's original pitch for this was jokingly (I hope) entitled Carry On Up The Cyber!’\nNOTES: 32. Line changed to: 'Matty?’ 33. Line changed to: 'There's lots of people. PART TWO 34. 'Oh,' added at the beginning of the line. 35. Line changed to: 'I could mend the console for you.’ Gary Russell: 'I asked Sarah Sutton to change this to make it clear that it's the console she wants to repair, not Matty.’ 36. \"Well,' added at the beginning of the line. 37. Line changed to: 'What can possibly be more important than saving the people?’ 38. Line changed to: ‘Tl be—back—soon,—Nyssa. (Spotting the creature) Oh, hello? And what are you doing out here?’ 39. Line changed to: 'I'm the... I'm, I'm the Doctor.’ 40. Line changed to: 'I'd half-hoped for a riot.' 41. Line changed to: '(Wary) Yeah, I'm Frank Hartley.’ 42. Line changed to: 'Here. Have a glass of wine.’ 43. Line changed to: 'No one is exempt. Go on, forget your vows, and have a drink.’ 44. Line changed to: 'No, no, no, no. Your cargo. Look.’\nNOTES: 45. Line changed to: \"Travelling south up Second Street.’\nNOTES: 46. Line changed to: ‘mbarassed)—Well.._yeah. I just don't know’ what he'll do, see.'\nNOTES: 47. Line changed to: 'It's typical, that is.'\nNOTES: 48. Line changed to: 'Oh, you'll get your uniform all right.’\nNOTES: 49. Line changed to: 'Move on. Keep going. Bless you all. Bless you. Bless you all. Keep in line.’ Marc Platt: ‘Sister Constant's blessings are so hideously well-meant and misguided. She imagines she's sending her recruits to a better life and is brim full of love. The reliance on geothermal power from the centre of Mondas predicts the statement in The Tenth Planet that the planet's energy is exhausted.'\nNOTES: 50. Line changed to: ‘Rather rapidly, once they heard about a_ beetroot truck spilling its load a couple of streets away.’ Marc Platt: I felt a bit embarrassed here. Peter reminded us that blocks were American and we should be using streets. Considering the efforts I'd made to ensure the city was British, I'm not sure how that slipped through the net.’\nNOTES: Gary Russell: 'How'd it get through? Bad script-editing, frankly. Shoot the script editor! Oh wait... that's me...'\nNOTES: 51. Line changed to: \"You come out of there’ 52. Line changed to: 'They're all vacuum packed for freshness. The real perishables are in the cold store. A full range of bodily organs, limbs - all\nNOTES: sizes and colours and creeds.’ Also, the scene switches to and from a Cybermat's perspective during this line. Marc Platt: ‘Details come from the oddest places. When I worked for Trust House Forte in the Seventies, the meat for the restaurant was delivered in big plastic vacuum-packed sachets and kept in a walk-in cold store. Which is probably another reason I'm vegetarian these days. If you look in the supermarkets in Chinatown near Leicester Square, there are far weirder things in plastic bags in the frozen food section. Dodd would be happy for hours.’\nNOTES: 53. Line changed to: ‘People, I mean even people with terminal injuries and blood running across the floor, all they want is titanium and _ plastic.’ The scene leaves the Cybermat's point of view during this line.\nNOTES: 54. Line changed to: 'Some have got so much it drives them crazy.'\nNOTES: 55. Line changed to: 'Yeah, well, that's what Dad does.’\nNOTES: 56. Line changed to: ‘(Petrified whisper - no _ screams) Please. No. Please, no. (She fades off to side) Please. Help. Help me. Please.’\nNOTES: 57. Line changed to: 'He... he put up quite a struggle.’\nNOTES: 58. Line changed to: 'Gone out the back like a bleeding greyhound.’ Marc\nNOTES: Piatt: 'Yes, definitely an improvement by Derren Nesbitt. I'd thought whippets (far too Northern social-stereotyped anyway) would be a thing of the past, but Dodd undoubtedly spends an occasional evening down at the city's less than lugubrious dog track.'\nNOTES: 59. Line changed to: 'Hang on! Hang on, where's your warrant?’\nNOTES: 60. Line changed to: 'Oh, no, no, no you don't.’\nNOTES: 61. Line changed to: 'I brought yeu some provisions.’\nNOTES: 62. Line changed to: ‘(Under family) ...we can show you these outfits,\nNOTES: designed to protect courageous workers against the extreme freezing conditions on the surface in the’ propulsion factories. Surgeon-General Doctorman Christine Allan, who designed the _ suits, is seen here being congratulated by Surface Commander Zheng at a special reception from the Central Advisory Committee brought back Man's greatest endeavour.
