I’m senior management now.\nSALIM: (ALOUD) Will someone please remove this ‘manager’ from my mission control!\nJESSICA: This mess is yours? Then tell me why that rocket’s course is so off.\nSALIM: (WORKING COMPUTERS) It’s not, it’s — (REALISES) it is. Orbital altitude... That’s far too high. I’m going to spin it. (CALLS) Flight, I’m doing a three-second burst in three... two... firing.\nSALIM: One... two... burn complete.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 17\nJESSICA: Then what’s that?\nSALIM: It’s another burn! Flight! Did you signal a second burn?\nISRA: TECH #2: Not us.\nJESSICA: Sort out the blame later. Salvage 2’s just looped past Alpha- Alpha-One.\nSALIM: (INTO HEADSET) Nav-Con, put course projections on the main screen. I want to see where it’s going.\nJESSICA: Nav-Con, Jessica Allaway. Put the orbital map there too. I want to see what it’s going to hit.\nISRA: TECH #1: Who are you?\nJESSICA: Nav-Con, if I have to fire everybody this minute, it’1ll just save me doing it tomorrow. Orbital map. Screen. Now.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. MANDELA — OBSERVATION ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR IS ON HIS FEET, PACING. VERY AWARE THAT SOMETHING\nHAS: GONE WRONG. )\nJYOTI: Look! Another flash! But it’s so close! Why can’t I see the ship?\nDOCTOR: You can’t see it because it’s facing us head on. It’s flying straight at us. Jyoti. Go. Get everybody into the secure area, right now.\nJYOTI: I haven’t got the authority and I’m betting you haven’t either.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter who has authority. Everyone is in danger, get them to the best-protected module on the station. You have minutes. At best.\nJYOTI: The Mandela’s a mile wide, how I can reach everybody?\nFLIP: Phone them?\nDOCTOR: Good idea! — well done, Flip. Now, the TARDIS.\nJYOTI: We’re not really going to be hit, are we?\nFLIP: Doctor, we're not really going to run away?\nDOCTOR: No, we're going to intercept Salvage 2 in the TARDIS.\nFLIP: No. You intercept that thing, I'll help here. (TO JYOTI) Jyoti, show me to the phone system. Can you do that?\nJYOTI: I don’t know if I should.\nDOCTOR: If I get this right, Flip, you might even be safer here.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 19\nFLIP: Oh, now, you know me. Caution is my middle name. And hey! You're always telling me not to run off. Well, here I am, not running off.\nDOCTOR: I’1l be back before you know it. And then I’m going to show you India.\nFLIP: No hurry.\nJYOTI: There’s a comms panel here.\nFLIP: You’re up, then. Get calling.\nJYOTI: (PRESSES A BUTTON) Attention, everyone!\nJYOTI: (HER VOICE ECHOES OVER MAIN SPEAKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATION,\nINCLUDING: THIS MODULE)\nJYOTI: This is an emergency! The Salvage 2 craft is on a collision course with the Mandela! All crew, evacuate to module S-Eleven immediately!\nFLIP: How will we know if it’s worked?\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: (OVER SPEAKER) Jyoti, what are you talking about?\nJYOTI: (INTO COMMS) Commander Gabbard. Sir! I’m serious!\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: (OVER SPEAKER) Then you’re imagining things.\nFLIP: Let me. (INTO COMMS) Hello. I’m Philippa Jackson, I’ma stowaway and she’s not imagining me, is she?\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: (OVER SPEAKER) You’re a what?!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 20\nFLIP: You heard, deal with it. Listen: this Salvage 2 thing is coming to eat us for dinner, so get with the programme and evacuate everyone to the safe areas right now. Okay? Me out.\nJYOTI: Wow.\nFLIP: I’ve got a younger brother. You learn how to get things done.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: There’s your problem, right there. Flight computer course program has been patched. Sabotage, clear as day.\nSALIM: Can’t be.\nJESSICA: Timestamps don’t lie. You’ve got yourself a saboteur.\nSALIM: Two saboteurs. The power short, remember?\nJESSICA: Two separate acts of sabotage, here in mission control? That’s... unlucky.\nSALIM: We cannot discuss it now. (F/X BLEEPS) Look, we are running out of propellant on Salvage 2, I need to spin her into a longer, lower course.\nJESSICA: I can do this.\nSALIM: My ship. My fault. I’m putting it right.\nISRA: TECH #2: Time to Mandela, two minutes.\nJESSICA: Okay. But do it faster.\nJESSICA: Are we losing power again?\nSALIM: It’s the Clean Up programming kicking back in. Salvage 2’s locked on a target. Commencing clean up procedure.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. MANDELA — OBSERVATION MODULE\nDOCTOR WHO: (EVACUATION ALARMS ARE SOUNDING BUT FLIP AND JYOTI ARE IGNORING THEM. )\nFLIP: Okay, if we can’t get to this secure module in time, is there someone else? Somewhere without a great big window?\nJYOTI: There it is! Look at that. Where’s my camera?\nFLIP: That is one ugly spaceship.\nJYOTI: It’s opening up.\nFLIP: It can’t swallow the station, can it?\nJYOTI: No chance.\nFLIP: That’s something.\nJYOTI: But it can take a big bite out of our module. Got it. Filming. This is fan — LOOK! What’s that?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Is that one of ours?\nSALIM: There’s something in the way. Something’s just appeared on the screen. It’s — it looks like a box.\nJESSICA: A little box. What is that?\nSALIM: It’s flying into the ship. How is it flying into the ship? What aS: DE?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. INT. MANDELA — OBSERVATION MODULE\nFLIP: It’s the TARDIS. Flying in between us and that ship. I can’t\nFLIP: watch.\nJYOTI: This is fantastic footage. (SEES THE TARDIS ENTERING SALVAGE 2)\nJYOTI: Whoa!\nFLIP: Hang about — where’d it go? The TARDIS?\nJYOTI: Right inside Salvage 2.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nSALIM: (READING) Target acquired. It thinks this, this box is the satellite it was after.\nJESSICA: Well, whatever it is, give it a round of applause. Salvage 2’s programming will change course now. It’1ll dive straight into a steep re-entry and spit it out. The Mandela’s safe.\nSALIM: That was the plan, yes.\nJESSICA: I know. I approved the procedure. How long ‘til it’s supposed to change course?\nSALIM: I’d say ten, maybe twenty seconds ago.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. INT. MANDELA — OBSERVATION MODULE\nJYOTI: Look, I’m sorry for your friend but he’s saved the station.\nFLIP: Look again.\nJYOTI: I don’t understand.\nFLIP: That ship, Salvage 2! It’s still coming for us! There’s definitely nowhere safer than here?\nJYOTI: No. This never happens.\nFLIP: Space suits, then. Have you got any space suits?\nJYOTI: In the lockers.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: First bit of good news all day: system’s recognised my authorisation codes.\nSALIM: More than I do.\nJESSICA: I’m sending override commands to Salvage 2.\nSALIM: (CALLING) Security! (TO JESSICA) Jessica, get out of here.\nJESSICA: No response.\nSALIM: What? Your answer is you won’t answer?\nJESSICA: No response from Salvage 2. Lose the attitude, Slim — I’m the one here legally, right now you’re work experience. Get me control of Salvage 2.\nSALIM: I’m trying-! It’s like there’s something in Salvage 2 counteracting every command we give it!\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Hello? Anyone there?\nJESSICA: What? Who’s that? Where’s it coming from?\nSALIM: (TO JESSICA) I don’t know. TV reporter maybe. Run those overrides again, I’m holding nav-con.\nJESSICA: Right.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) No, this must be the right frequency. Hello, mission control, this is the Doctor, I’m aboard Salvage 2.\nSALIM: It’s nonsense. Nobody’s there. Turn him off.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 28\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Release nav-con to me. Oh, and flight now, I had control of flight.\nJESSICA: I just got control of flight right now. He’s real.\nSALIM: No, he isn’t. (INTO HEADSET) Clear this line! We have an emergency!\nJESSICA: Look at the monitors. It’s seconds from hitting the station.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) I haven’t time, release controls.\nSALIM: (INTO HEADSET) Salvage 2 is automated! There’s no one on board!\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Wrong. Look, if you don’t want to help, at least stop fiddling.\nSALIM: (TO JESSICA) What are you doing?\nJESSICA: I’m stopping fiddling.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Thank you!\nSALIM: He really is there.\nJESSICA: For how much longer?\nSALIM: Impact with space station in three...\nJESSICA: It won’t hit.\nSALIM: . two...\nJESSICA: Not with me in charge.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 29\nSALIM: One. Impact.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. INT. MANDELA — OBSERVATION MODULE\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE SMASH OF SALVAGE 2 HITTING THE STATION. IT’S NOT A HEAD-ON\nCOLLISION: IT CLIPS THE MODULE THAT FLIP AND JYOTI ARE IN. THEY’RE TRYING TO GET SPACESUITS ON. )\nFLIP: Jyoti! Leave the camera!\nJYOTI: Just a sec, this is too good.\nFLIP: Listen! That means we’ve been punctured, doesn’t it?\nJYOTI: Yeah. Air venting into space. Oh, I so hope this camera is 3D.\nFLIP: Put your helmet on. Do it now.\nJYOTI: (PUTTING ON HELMET) Alright, alright.\nFLIP: And show me how to do mine. — Gah, I can’t move in this suit! Why’s mine twice the size of yours?\nJYOTI: (HELMETED) Hold still! (FIXING FLIP’S HELMET THROUGH:) It’s just what we had. You got a Baumgartner, I got a basic Aldrin.\nFLIP: (HELMETED) But you keep them topped up with oxygen, right?\nJYOTI: (HELMETED) Not really, no.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Looks like the impact has clipped a Mandela module. Bad news for anyone in it, but it looks like the rest of the station is safe.\nSALIM: Salvage 2 showing course change. Bit late, but it’s changing. Reaching ejection point.\nJESSICA: Okay. You can stand down now, Slim.\nSALIM: I’m not going anywhere.\nJESSICA: (ALOUD) Attention, everyone! There’s a saboteur on staff. I want everyone out of mission control.\nTECHNICIANS: (AUDIBLE CONSTERNATION) Is she mad?/ That’s insane!\nJESSICA: (ALOUD) I said everyone! (CLAPS HANDS) Go on, move it! There’s a security team waiting outside. Report for debriefing now or I’ll have you arrested! Don’t think I don’t mean it!\nJESSICA: Same goes for you, Slim. The mission’s over.\nSALIM: Please, not now! We’ve reached the ejection point, but there’s been no ejection. We’re going to lose Salvage 2!\nJESSICA: Forget Salvage 2. It’s dead, gone, finished. You need to start thinking about the inquiry into this mess.\nSALIM: That man may still be aboard, whoever he was!\nJESSICA: If I were you, Slim, I'd keep things simple. There was no mysterious stranger aboard Salvage 2. There can’t have been.\nSALIM: Then how do you explain it?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 32\nJESSICA: Maybe he was the saboteur, hacking into our comms.\nSALIM: Do you think so...?\nJESSICA: Could be he’s right inside this building.\nJESSICA: (F/X TARDIS MATERIALISATION, JUST OFF. NB: LAST OF THE\nTECHNICIANS: HAS GONE BY NOW)\nSALIM: Is — is that something to do with you?\nJESSICA: I don’t believe it...\nDOCTOR: Oh, so it is you. Jessica Allaway. Thought I recognised the voice.\nJESSICA: Have we met?\nDOCTOR: Well, we have now. (TO SALIM) You — you must be the mission controller, is that right?\nSALIM: I’m Salim Jahangir, but —\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — next time, Salim, program some leeway in your spacecraft’s payload parameters, would you? My TARDIS was a little heavier than a satellite.\nSALIM: (CALLING) Security!\nJESSICA: (CALLING) Security!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Security!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: Must be on a tea break.\nJESSICA: Busy processing the technical staff. We’ve got a saboteur.\nDOCTOR: I can see you’ve got a lot of problems here but trust me, I am not one of them. Please, let me at the controls.\nSALIM: (TO DOCTOR) Salvage 2 is gone. What exactly do you think you can do, mister, eY...?\nDOCTOR: Doctor. I did say. Now, do you want to save Salvage 2 or not?\nJESSICA: Alright, go ahead.\nSALIM: Are you serious?\nJESSICA: It’s an expensive machine. It’s lost now, but if he really thinks he can salvage it...\nSALIM: And you trust him? — Oh, oh, of course. It’s because he’s British!\nDOCTOR: If you two could bear to put your obvious differences aside for just one moment — I’m going to need a radio link to the Mandela. Can you do that?\nSALIM: (INTO HEADSET) I-S-R-A Mission Control calling Mandela. Come in, Mandela Station.\nJESSICA: No answer.\nSALIM: (READING OFF SCREEN) There’s computer traffic, but it’s all bad. Says they’ve lost a module.\nDOCTOR: I knew it had hit the station. I felt it. But a whole module? Which one?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 34\nSALIM: Wait... Good news, it was just observation.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no! Flip..!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24. EXT. SPACE\nDOCTOR WHO: (F/X FLIP’S SPACE-SUIT AND HER BREATHING.

I can’t see which buttons you meant.\nFLIP: (F/X PRESSES BUTTONS ON THE ARM OF HER SUIT; IT BLEEPS AND\nIMMEDIATELY: JYOTI’S VOICE STARTS)\nJYOTI: - ellow, the yellow button switches on the radio. Green to talk to me.\nFLIP: Gotcha. Green for go. Are you okay?\nJYOTI: I’m fantastic. I saved the camera! Give me a wave.\nFLIP: Hello. Can you see the module?\nJYOTI: It’s floating away behind you. But it’s the space station we need, not the module.\nFLIP: Right. Okay. (BEAT) Is that footage being seen anywhere? Does anyone know we’re out here?\nJYOTI: No. And radios are seriously short-range. These suits are just module spares from when it was fitted. I’ve got forty-six minutes’ oxygen, what about you?\nFLIP: I don’t know how to tell.\nJYOTI: Hold down green and blue buttons for a sec.\nFLIP: Wow, television. It says oxygen fifty-three minutes — and now everything’s gone red.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 36\nJYOTI: (INTERRUPTED) — breaking up.

Everything up there that isn’t junk. Have you got that?\nSALIM: Spaceguard. If it’s not on Spaceguard, and it’s bigger than a fist, NASA tracks it as space junk.\nDOCTOR: As a matter of fact, I helped get Spaceguard started.\nJESSICA: (WITHERING) Of course you did.\nDOCTOR: Spaceguard systems online. Good. Could you all keep quiet for just one second? I need to get this into my head.\nSALIM: What? You’re going to memorise the orbital database?\nJESSICA: Five thousand active satellites and fifteen thousand pieces of junk?\nDOCTOR: I did say give me a second.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26.

Supposedly geo-stationary but they will have just a little course-correction propellant and they’re exactly where I need them.\nSALIM: Spaceguard reporting SuperSoap satellite deviating from orbit.\nJESSICA: Yes, and I’ve got the Newshub Nine satellite increasing altitude.\nSALIM: They’re going to hit each other!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I do hope so.\nSALIM: I’ve got visual from cameras on one of —\nSALIM: (F/X ALARMS STOP. ‘BANG’ AS SATELLITES COLLIDE [NOT STRICTLY ACCURATE, BUT]. )\nSALIM: Oh, I felt that one.\nJESSICA: Do you know how much just one of those satellites costs?\nDOCTOR: Flip is worth more. Now, I need something in a low-Earth orbit...\nJESSICA: Spaceguard says an old Soviet spy satellite is increasing altitude. It’s going to be in their path.\nDOCTOR: One satellite hits another, hits another, hits another.\nSALIM: And what is the point? We’re supposed to be clearing up space junk, not making more.\nJESSICA: Is this you, Doctor? French elliptical orbiter firing thrusters.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. EXT.

Odd cylindrical shape.\nSALIM: (LYING) I do not know what it is.\nDOCTOR: Really? Because from what I can see, it would have been directly in Salvage 2’s orbital path.\nJESSICA: (THOUGHTFUL) Like whoever sabotaged the flight computer wanted Salvage 2 to hit it..\nDOCTOR: Well, whatever it is, it’s the last domino. Impact imminent.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31. EXT. SPACE\nFLIP: It’s the Doctor! He’s alive!\nJYOTI: Where?\nFLIP: Look! Spin around. There’s like this whole string of satellites ramming into each another, knocking the next one on! Who else but the Doctor would think of that?\nJYOTI: What? Think of what?\nFLIP: He’s sending a satellite our way. He’s sending us a satellite to grab onto! Doctor, you are brilliant!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. INT.

I had no imagination then.\nJESSICA: Impact in ten.\nSALIM: Sixty satellites now moving out of the way. People have finally caught on to what you’re doing.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t matter now, so long as none cross in front of this last one in the next — Jessica?\nJESSICA: Four seconds. Three. Two...\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33. INT. SPACE\nFLIP: There, the big cylinder one. It’s going to be knocked our way any moment. Get ready to grab hold.\nFLIP: (F/X SMALL SATELLITE COLLIDES WITH BIG CYLINDRICAL ONE. THE\nCYLINDRICAL: ONE IS ‘SCAVENGER’. IT ABSORBS THE IMPACT)\nJYOTI: No good. The cylinder one isn’t moving.

No, no, no...\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SYSTEMS) Stand by. Scavenger systems rebooting. Navigation. Propulsion. Weapons.\nJESSICA: Is that what I think it is?

This is the perfect moment to announce that the Indian government has handed I-S-R-A over to us.\nSALIM: Have they?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 53\nJESSICA: Once I’ve reminded them of the small print in the contract, yes.\nDOCTOR: Now, then, Salim, what’s this cloud backup that’s started?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39.

Back a little.\nJYOTI: No, wait, it’s moving.\nFLIP: It’s turning. It’s lighting up. Jyoti, I think its engines have started!\nSALIM: So that’s what it looks like.\nDOCTOR: It’s bigger than I expected.\nSALIM: I think it’s smaller.\nDOCTOR: Wind back to the impact. I want to calculate its mass.\nSALIM: That’s hard to watch.\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I think it must be hollow? Still very strong.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 56\nSALIM: What are those markings? It might almost be Sanskrit.\nDOCTOR: It’s not an Earth language. Whatever Scavenger is... it’s alien.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. EXT. SPACE\nJYOTI: Ten minutes oxygen left. You on sixteen or seventeen?\nFLIP: Plenty of time. And Jyoti, I don’t see anyone else floating around out here. We saved some people on the Mandela. You and me. What else are we here for if not that?\nJYOTI: [PRONOUNCED ‘CHAA-T’, LIKE ‘CHART’ WITHOUT THE R] Samosa Chaat, for one. Meeting new people —\nFLIP: Um, hello?\nJYOTI: - creating something worthwhile, you know?\nFLIP: I know.\nJYOTI: I was going to be a film producer. Family forced me into science. I had all my life for the movies, they said. “Get a profession, see the world.”\nFLIP: Yes, family’s never fun. But bet yours are proud of you.\nJYOTI: Weren’t yours?\nFLIP: They were all “why aren’t you a boy?” And then they had one. I left. It’s 2071, they might even have noticed by now. And I wish they’d been bothered enough to say “see the world”.\nJYOTI: Why?\nFLIP: Look down, Jyoti. One world, job done.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nSALIM: We’ve got the whole file now.\nDOCTOR: Play the last moments for me, would you?\nFLIP: I think this thing has stopped firing. How long have you got left on oxygen?\nSALIM: That’s where it ends.\nDOCTOR: And that’s my cue.\nSALIM: I’ve got Salvage 2 heading their way.\nDOCTOR: No. They’re low on oxygen. I can get to them faster than Salvage 2 can.\nSALIM: Seriously?\nJESSICA: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) You’re not planning on going anywhere, I hope?\nDOCTOR: Ms Allaway. It’s quite alright, there’s no need to thank me. If it’s all the same to you, I’1ll just be on my way in my funny blue box.\nJESSICA: Security.\nSECURITY GUY: (INTERCEPTING THE DOCTOR) Sir — Ma’am would rather you stayed.\nJESSICA: Ma’am insists.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR: At gunpoint? Madam, I enjoy a good exchange of opinions but if you’re going to threaten me...\nJESSICA: You thought that was a threat? I was being nice. This is a threat: you’re an asset, Doctor, but you’re unauthorised. So far the one has balanced the other, but if you try to leave, you will be shot.\nSALIM: Seriously, Jessica. There’s no need for all this.\nDOCTOR: More to the point, there’s no time. (TO JESSICA) People’s lives are at risk, you do realise that?\nJESSICA: Okay. You want to talk about lives. How about everyone on the Mandela?\nDOCTOR: They’re fine. Probably.\nSALIM: Computer chatter says they’ve restored gyros, they’ve got EVAsS repairing some systems. They lost a module but everything else is okay.\nJESSICA: But where is that module? This module that’s easily ten times the size of the Envisat zombie satellite. It’s somewhere in orbit — and it’s a very, very big addition to all the junk up there.\nDOCTOR: She’s right, Salim.\nJESSICA: Don’t sound so shocked. If that module smashes into the Mandela, nothing will save that station or any of the people aboard. So, Doctor, evidently you know more about orbital mechanics than is healthy and I need that right now. Your job is protecting the Mandela. From the module and from this Scavenger.\nDOCTOR: Your own database will be tracking both. My job is rescuing Flip and Jyoti.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 60\nJESSICA: I’m coming to that. Slim — I saw the look on your face when that ‘Scavenger’ first appeared, I’ve a feeling you know a whole lot more about it that you’re letting on.\nSALIM: Rubbish.\nDOCTOR: I confess, Salim, your reaction did seem a little... odd.\nJESSICA: Exactly. So what’s happening in just a few minutes is, you’re going to tell me and the Doctor everything you know. But first, I’m going to run a visual inspection on the Mandela by diverting a spy satellite to it. Then, the Doctor can fly it to rescue his friends. And didn’t I seem like the bad guy?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. EXT. SPACE\nJYOTI: Flip, what’s your heads-up say about your suit?\nFLIP: Not a clue. There’s a thing saying PSI. I thought that was a TV show.\nJYOTI: You might be able to jump.\nFLIP: Sorry?\nJYOTI: I can’t, my suit won’t take the pressure. But yours is a Baumgartner, you got the full kit. I should’ve thought of it before. What’s your oxygen?\nFLIP: Hang on, did you see that?\nJYOTI: Is it firing again?\nFLIP: No, behind it. I thought — now it’s above it, climbing, yes, there’s a — look, you can see it when it crosses the Earth, there’s a black satellite moving.\nJYOTI: It’s very close to the Scavenger.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44.

That satellite is coming our way and we’re grabbing it, okay?\nJYOTI: Then what?\nFLIP: We’re going home. Mandela station or bust.\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKERS) Identification: Scavenger. Systems resumed. Failure detected on visual. Visual equipment supply detected.\nFLIP: Scavenger’s moving! Oh, why can’t we reach anyone?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKERS) Recovery and replacement program activated.\nSALIM: Look.\nJESSICA: It’s moving fast. There’s a lot of visual equipment on Sid. It’s detected the camera gear and it wants it.\nDOCTOR: That’s rather impressive. I wonder how it knows?\nSALIM: If we’ve got cameras, why don’t we use them?\nDOCTOR: What a good idea.\nDOCTOR: Would you look at that? Now that’s precision flying, if I do say so myself. Perfectly lined up, it’1ll fly right beside the Mandela. Switching to 180 rear camera. Oh.\nJESSICA: There they are. Our two astronauts. Scavenger’s closing in.\nDOCTOR: It’s gaining on them. — There, that one must be Flip. Good girl! She’s got Jyoti in a position to grab on.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. EXT. SPACE\nFLIP: Reach for the satellite! Get a hold!\nFLIP: Whoa, that’s a punch to the ribs. Jyoti? Are you on?\nJYOTI: (PANTING) Yeah. — I think I’m going to throw up in my suit.\nFLIP: Lovely.\nFLIP: (F/X LASER BLAST FROM OFF — THE SCAVENGER SHOOTING ITS\nTELEPORT: BEAM AT THEM; SEE LAHORE FLASHBACK SCENES 54-56)\nFLIP: What the-?

The whole screen’s glowing a kind of pink.\nDOCTOR: All forward motion has been arrested. That beam from Scavenger, it’s holding Sid. Cycle the cameras, are Flip and Jyoti okay?\nSALIM: No sign on the perimeter or rear cameras.\nJESSICA: They’ve let go. Look, on forward view. They’ve let go and they’re carrying on toward the Mandela.\nDOCTOR: Momentum! And she says she never paid attention in school.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. EXT. SPACE\nJYOTI: (INCREASINGLY WEAK.

The momentum’s gonna carry us all the way to the —\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: (OVER HELMET SPEAKER) Commander Gabbard, Mandela station, to astronaut. Come in Jyoti. Is that you? Opening the airlock now.\nFLIP: Hear that, Jyoti? Almost there. (BEAT) Jyoti? (BEAT) Jyoti! Stay conscious, just a little longer. One more minute and we’1l be on board the Mandela, you’1ll see. (BEAT) Here it comes now, the airlock. Just let go of me, and grab a hold.\nJYOTI: (RASPING) No strength left.\nFLIP: Let go of me. Let go!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nDOCTOR: They’re opening an airlock on the Mandela. (BEAT) And that camera’s gone, just at the good bit. Let’s try the rear view, see if Scavenger’s taken that yet.\nSALIM: I’m glad your friend is alright.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (RE SCAVENGER) It really is fascinating. Part mechanical, part sonic, part laser. Taking what it needs from the spy satellite. It genuinely is scavenging.\nSALIM: We have to find a way to stop it. It won’t stop at cameras, it...\nJESSICA: Uh-huh.\nDOCTOR: You do know about this Scavenger — don’t you, Salim?\nSALIM: Sixty years it’s taken me. (SNORTS) And that’s just to get Salvage 2 in place.\nDOCTOR: Sixty years...?!\nJESSICA: Alright, I get it. You knew there was an alien satellite hidden in all that space junk and you wanted the technology, hence “Salvage”. (BEAT) Don’t blame you. We’re not so different, Salim.\nDOCTOR: Except Salim here isn’t interested in the technology. Are you, Salim? Flip and Jyoti are safely aboard the Mandela. Scavenger is quiet. We have this moment. Speak.\nSALIM: If either of you knew your history —\nDOCTOR: I have what you might call a working knowledge of it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 69\nSALIM: History is supposed to be what happens to other people. What happened to other people. I don’t know what you call it when it’s personal. When your own life becomes legend.\nDOCTOR: Feels strange, doesn’t it?\nSALIM: I was royalty.\nJESSICA: (SNORTS) Oh, here we go.\nSALIM: What, Englishwoman? Have you never heard the story of the Crown Prince Salim and the slave girl Anarkali?\nJESSICA: British, not English. So, you’ve a royal ancestor. Not that unusual where I come from.\nDOCTOR: Ms Allaway. Please.\nSALIM: I am the Crown Prince Salim. I stopped ageing the day she was taken.\nJESSICA: (LAUGHS) And people say I’m full of it.\nSALIM: I am the Crown Prince.

She’s still out there!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Four hundred and ninety-six! Stop wasting my time with these fantasies, Salim, and get to the point: what is Scavenger?\nSALIM: I am not spinning some idle yarn.\nDOCTOR: There I have to disagree. The story of the Crown Prince Salim and the slave girl Anarkali is, I’m afraid, pure fiction.\nJESSICA: Hah!\nDOCTOR: I know because I once met its author — oh, many, many years ago. A man named Abdul Halim Sharar. (BEAT) Although, now I come to think of him —\nSALIM: Was he about my height at all? Of similar build?\nDOCTOR: Well, now that you mention it...\nSALIM: I was Sharar. But you were not the well-travelled Doctor I once met, in the seventeenth century. He was an entirely different person.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I would have been.\nJESSICA: I could get the pair of you certified right now. In fact, I think I will.\nDOCTOR: Ms Allaway, this is important!\nSALIM: People say that my Anarkali was executed for being in love with me. That she “died between two walls”. Men have searched palaces all over this land for those walls; they have claimed to have found them, even. Sometimes, they have changed the ending of the story, to suit their need for romance. But I alone remember the truth.\nDOCTOR: So what is the truth, Salim? What really happened?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 72\nSALIM: The story begins in my palace at Lahore, in the year sixteen hundred, shortly after my return from fourteen years in the military... only to find that a flower I had left behind had blossomed in my absence.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53.

It changes things, for my enemy to have a name.\nDOCTOR: This Scavenger... scavenged Anarkali?\nSALIM: My Anarkali was taken into the skies above Lahore in the year 1600. Every night since I have worked to bring her back. I have watched the beast circle high above me for one hundred and seventy thousand nights. While Anarkali is gone, I can no longer rule, I can no longer age. Love alone is the reason I still live.\nDOCTOR: There might be rather more to it than that.\nJESSICA: You think this girl is still alive? Inside Scavenger?\nSALIM: Of course she is. “Between two walls”.\nDOCTOR: Salim, Scavenger was asleep in orbit for four hundred years until we woke it up. Nothing dormant could sustain an atmosphere that long. Even if her life was extended as long as you say yours was, without oxygen or a proper atmosphere... Anarkali can’t be alive.

It searches with these beams. One of them struck me back in Lahore, I could feel it examining me.\nDOCTOR: Yet it didn’t scavenge you?\nSALIM: I had a cough... a virus. That’s all I can think of. I wasn’t as fit as Anarkali. The beam switched to her and then she was taken.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Jyoti, are you feeling alright?\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Doesn’t matter.

It’s nothing.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Thank you, Jyoti.\nJESSICA: Your friend was the healthier of the two, the fitter.\nSALIM: So that’s who Scavenger took.

Why one hundred litres?\nDOCTOR: Good question, Ms Allaway!\nSALIM: We breathe about one hundred litres in an hour but that’s air, not pure oxygen.\nDOCTOR: It’s seen or it’s assumed that Flip is oxygen-based and it wants to protect her — but only for one hour. Why one hour?\nJESSICA: Better than seven minutes.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 83\nSALIM: Doctor, Spaceguard reports Scavenger is moving.\nDOCTOR: It’s on the hunt for oxygen. And I bet I know where it’s going!\nJESSICA: Looks like it’s heading for the Mandela.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The Mandela will have vented breathable air when it opened the airlock. Scavenger must’ve been just close enough to detect that. And now it knows it needs it.\nSALIM: (INTO MIC) Flip, it’s Salim.

Who’s there? I can’t see you. I can’t move...!\nANARKALI: I’m a friend.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR WHO: (F/X MUCH QUIETER. EVERYONE’S EVACUATED EXCEPT THE DOCTOR AND JYOTI.)\nJYOTI: Evacuation’s in progress, Doctor. The crew are all headed to the far modules.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. In which case, there’s no-one left on the bridge to complain about my doing this.\nJYOTI: You can’t raise the station orbit!\nDOCTOR: Almost nobody.\nJYOTI: Mandela stays in an area called the pizza box. It only moves within the box to avoid collisions with space junk.\nDOCTOR: A little up-thrust is all we need to get away from Scavenger.\nJYOTI: You don’t understand. You can’t blindly raise our orbit, we could crash straight into anything.\nDOCTOR: The Mandela may hit some small pieces of junk, that can’t be helped, but its Whipple shields should protect it. It certainly won’t survive being scavenged.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Scavenger should be onto the Mandela any moment now.\nSALIM: That’s strange.\nJESSICA: Why? What have you got?\nSALIM: Spaceguard says the Mandela isn’t — it’s not where it’s supposed to be!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68. INT. SCAVENGER — CONTINOUS\nANARKALT: Flip. Your name is Flip. Flip, you must open your mask.\nFLIP: (CROAKING: AIR RUNNING OUT) My helmet, are you nuts?\nANARKALT: You must trust me, Flip. I’m your friend.\nFLIP: What the hey, nothing to lose. (STRUGGLING) No good. Can’t reach the release. My arms are pinned. Wherever you are, help me!!!\nANARKALI: I cannot. You must release the mechanism yourself.\nFLIP: Why? Is there air in here?\nANARKALI: No. But Scavenger cannot begin to absorb you until you remove your mask. Then your pain will end.\nFLIP: (GASPING) What? Some friend you are.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nJYOTI: Where’s Scavenger now?\nDOCTOR: Circling below us. Trying to sniff out an oxygen source. Come on, Scavenger — work it out, you stupid machine!\nJYOTI: You don’t want it to find us, do you?\nDOCTOR: Of course not.\nJYOTI: And what about Flip? Doctor, she’s running out of time! Can’t you use your box to rescue her? That’s why you wanted Spacesuits, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: The spacesuits are for us, in case Scavenger attacks. No — if I try to materialise my TARDIS inside that thing, the risk is it’ll just end up scavenging the contents... me included. And that won’t help Flip, will it? No, no — I need Scavenger to work out the obvious solution. I just wish it’d hurry up!!!\nJYOTI: What obvious solution? Doctor...?!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70. INT. SCAVENGER\nANARKALI: I am sorry, Flip. We cannot locate oxygen.\nFLIP: (CROAKING) Oh, I want to go home. I really, really want to go home. Want to see London again. Proper London...\nANARKALT: Do not speak, Flip. You are wasting your breath.\nFLIP: (REALISATION) .. home. That’s it. Home! Scavenger, whoever you are, you’ve got to take me home! Right now! Take me home!\nANARKALI: ‘Home’? We do not understand ‘home’.\nFLIP: Earth, you moron! Earth! There’s oxygen on Earth!\nANARKALI: Earth.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71. INT.

There it goes, like a bullet!\nJYOTI: It’s heading to Earth?\nDOCTOR: The nearest supply of oxygen it can be certain of finding!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Look at that! Nothing we’ve got can move that quick. Do you know, this could even work out better than I promised.\nSALIM: Yes, it’s great news. Scavenger is nowhere near the Mandela now.\nJESSICA: Oh, yeah, yeah, the Mandela. Can’t be seen to damage the precious Mandela. No, I mean this could be good for industry.\nSALIM: British industry, I presume.\nJESSICA: Let’s not fight over politics. We’re on the same side now, Slim. We worked together to save the Mandela crew, that’1l play great in the press. And we worked together to rescue those astronauts in space, too. Same thing.\nSALIM: The Doctor did that but, yes, sure, we stood near him while he did it.\nJESSICA: I don’t see a Doctor. I don’t remember a Doctor on the British payroll. Is he on the Indian team?\nSALIM: (BITTER) Rewriting history. You really are British.\nJESSICA: Through and through.\nSALIM: Spaceguard and Haystack alarms. Scavenger is entering the atmosphere. Going very fast. She’1ll burn up at that speed, she has to!\nJESSICA: The Doctor’s box didn’t burn up. We can’t presume Scavenger will. (SIGH) Oh, I so wanted its technology... but if it’s coming to Earth, the situation’s changed. We have to treat it as a threat.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 96\nSALIM: So much for being on the same side. It listened to the Doctor, it might listen to me. (INTO MIC) Scavenger, you’re going too fast, you’ll burn up.\nSALIM: See? — that’s a course change. Not much of one. But it’s a change.\nJESSICA: (TO SALIM) No. Coincidence. It’s already in a re-entry blind spot. No comms at that speed and approach, you know that. (INTO PHONE) Jessica Allaway, get me missile command right now.\nSALIM: What do you want ‘missile command’ for?\nJESSICA: Work it out, Slim.\nSALIM: Give me that.\nJESSICA: (INTO PHONE) You’ve got an inbound bogie, ten o’clock high. Take it out.\nSALIM: (INTO PHONE) Abort! Hello?\nJESSICA: They’ve got their orders and they’re gone. Standard protocol. When Scavenger reaches 3,000 metres, a Rapier missile from HMS Ocean will destroy it. (A THREAT) Play along, Slim. For the team. No more attempts at sabotage.\nSALIM: Oh yes, ‘sabotage’. That’s what you’ve been saying to the press, isn’t it? That the Salvage 2 mission was sabotaged by someone on my team? By me, even?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 97\nJESSICA: Well, you did, didn’t you? Fix the flight computer so Savage 2 would meet with Scavenger, not Envisat? — Look, I’ve said nothing outright. Might’ve hinted at it a bit. I’m sure we can come to some arrangement.\nSALIM: Oh, I see. So long as I say nothing about you having the power cut to mission control, right at the start of the mission?\nJESSICA: Prove it, big man.\nSALIM: Suddenly the whole complex loses power and you arrive. It doesn’t take a genius.\nJESSICA: What can I say? I arrange a little power cut, Salvage 2 goes off course, Britain saves the day. It was all in the contract, Slim. We loan you a pitiful sum of money but should anything happen to go wrong, then we take over. We get the technology rights.\nSALIM: But nothing went wrong!\nJESSICA: Looks like it to me. Looks like it to the world. Satellites crashing? Mandela damaged?\nSALIM: I will tell the world the truth!\nJESSICA: Go right ahead. Go tell the press that you’re really four hundred and ninety-six years old. Because they’1l take everything you say so seriously after that.\nSALIM: The air is getting stale around here. I am going outside.\nJESSICA: (CALLS) If you’re going to flounce off, be a lamb and get me some coffee?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. INT. SCAVENGER\nDOCTOR WHO: (ENGINE NOISE — AND THEN WHUMP, SCAVENGER IS IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

Real Earth aiv...\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: Altitude 4,500 metres. Normally I’d not recommend breathing at that height but it’s better than nothing. For a short time, anyway.\nJYOTI: And it will be a short time.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s also a bit worrying. Altitude now 4,100 metres. It’s going so fast, will Flip’s suit stand up to the changes in pressure?\nJYOTI: Not what I mean. Look at the screen. There’s something inbound at 3,000 metres. Something very fast.\nDOCTOR: I see it. (INTO MIC) Doctor calling Indian Space Research centre, Salim, can you hear me?\nJESSICA: (OVER SPEAKERS) Jessica here, Doctor. Salim’s gone off sulking, but I know what you want.\nDOCTOR: I want you to stop that missile.\nJESSICA: I just said, I know what you want.\nDOCTOR: Well?\nJESSICA: Yes, thanks. How are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: Where are you? Are you below me? Please move these walls, I’m pressed into them and they’re getting hot. Bad enough when they just made me claustrophobic.\nANARKALT: All will be well, now your glass mask is off.\nFLIP: Air's strange. Hurts my throat. My arm hurts too. I think I’ve broken it.\nANARKALI: It will not matter soon.\nFLIP: Scavenger, you’re sounding scarily fatalistic now.\nANARKALT: My name is not Scavenger. Scavenger is just a shell, intelligent enough to perform its tasks, to repair and replenish. My name is Anarkali.\nFLIP: (BLITHELY) Yeah, I know. — (BEAT) Hang on, how do I know?\nANARKALT: The absorption started as soon as your glass bowl came off.\nFLIP: Absorption-?!\nANARKALT: I am sorry, Flip. Once, I too was trapped here like you.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: (INTO MIC) Lovely to talk to you, Doctor, but I want to watch this. Bye.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) You’re killing Flip!\nJESSICA: (INTO MIC) You don’t really think she’s still alive, do you? Out of oxygen, stuck in an alien satellite, burning up in the fastest re-entry I’ve ever seen. Come on.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Remember Salim! He got probed by the Scavenger centuries ago and he’s still alive. Flip was brought on board by that same beam.\nJESSICA: (INTO MIC) Scavenger at 3,300 metres.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Call the missile off!\nJESSICA: (INTO MIC) No, I admit I was thinking Britain could do with this scavenging technology. But it’s military protocol, you know? If you can stop Scavenger heading to Earth like it’s going to blow right through the planet, you go for it. And I’1l get some PR out of it at least.\nJESSICA: (TO HERSELF) Now, if that long-life technology were real, that would be different.\nJESSICA: (INTO PHONE) Allaway. (BEAT) What do you mean, two-step authentication? Of course I really want the missile launched!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nJYOTI: I’m sorry, Doctor. You did really well, saving the station and getting oxygen to Flip.\nDOCTOR: I don’t need flattery, Jyoti.\nJYOTI: I’m serious. But now there’s nothing else you can do.\nDOCTOR: There is always something else you can do. (INTO MIC) Scavenger, this is the Doctor. Can you hear me? Can Flip hear me?\nJYOTI: Don’t assume silence is bad. It just means they’re still in re- entry blind spot.\nDOCTOR: No comms in or out. So Flip could be calling for me and I will never know.\nJYOTI: Altitude 3,000 metres. Missile on track. (BEAT) Goodness, Jessica Allaway is thorough.\nDOCTOR: Not what I’d say.\nJYOTI: I mean, look. There’s a second missile launch from the HMS Ocean.\nDOCTOR: But that will take minutes to reach Scavenger. Why does she think it will still be there?\nJYOTI: Like I said, thorough.\nDOCTOR: Wait, HMS Ocean? Are both missiles from the HMS Ocean?\nJYOTI: Presumably, but I don’t know. First missile impact estimated in... (BEAT) .. one minute.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: Not if I can help it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: Anarkali, what’s this on the walls? My helmet was all fogged up, I couldn’t see it before. Something written on the walls. (READING) “Could I behold...”\nANARKALT: “Could I behold the face of my beloved once more.”\nFLIP: (REALISATION) Blood? It’s written in blood.\nANARKALTI: I did not think I would survive...\nFLIP: Know the feeling.\nANARKALT: . and I was right.\nFLIP: Sorry?\nSCAVENGER: Identification: Scavenger. Weapons cycling. Range finding. Target focusing.\nFLIP: What’s that mean? What’s happening?\nANARKALT: Something is about to strike Scavenger.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: They really should change their passwords. Missile section. Abort codes. (F/X FINISHES TYPING) There!\nJYOTI: You’ve done it?\nDOCTOR: I’ve aborted the missiles!\nJYOTI: With seconds to go.\nDOCTOR: As ever.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80. INT. SCAVENGER\nSCAVENGER: Impact in three.\nFLIP: What’s about to strike? Space junk?\nSCAVENGER: Two.\nANARKALT: I do not know. We did not have such things in Lahore.\nSCAVENGER: One.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand.\nJYOTI: Understand what? Doctor, you did it! You aborted the missiles, they exploded — there, you can see their debris trail on the scope.\nDOCTOR: If that’s the case, where did Scavenger go? (JABBING SCREEN) And what’s that? That big blip flying left?\nJYOTI: It’s not Scavenger, it’s a completely different shape.\nDOCTOR: I need cameras. What’s got cameras?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: There you are. Salim, what did you do to my missile?\nSALIM: All I did was get us some coffee from your machine.\nJESSICA: While someone else just happened to detonate two Rapier missiles? Because it wasn’t me and it wasn’t Santa.\nSALIM: It wasn’t me either. (SMIRK) I was a bit busy remotely flying Salvage 2.\nJESSICA: You were what-?\nSALIM: Email me a reprimand. Bring it up at my one-to-one. Salvage 2’s orbit had come round, it was in range and its systems were fully restarted. I uploaded a fresh copy of the programming and told it Scavenger was the Clean Up Space target. It got there before your missile did. Scooped it up, swallowed it whole. And now it’s on a very low Earth orbit trajectory that will take it up over India and down to just about right outside our front door.\nJESSICA: Really.\nSALIM: Really. Want a look? I’1l switch on Salvage 2’s cameras.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: A new camera source just came online.\nJYOTI: Salvage 2.\nDOCTOR: Switching now. I have been wondering, what happened to Salvage 1?\nJYOTI: Some moon project from a hundred years ago. Nothing to do with us.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got what seems to be a forward view from Salvage 2. But I’m only seeing sky. No sign of Scavenger. Checking rear. It’s the same. Oh! Are you thinking what I’m thinking?\nJYOTI: Er, the weather’s very nice there?\nDOCTOR: Scavenger is inside Salvage 2. And they’re climbing to a low earth orbit, they’1ll be out of the comms blind spot. (INTO MIC) Scavenger, Flip, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84. INT. SCAVENGER [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: Doctor! Still got you in this helmet-mike thing. Listen, you’re\nFLIP: in danger!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 85. INT. ISRA [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKERS) Everyone’s in danger!\nSALIM: The Doctor’s friend. She’s alive. That’s fantastic. She’s alive, inside Scavenger! (THINKING ABOUT ANARKALI) And if she can survive...\nJESSICA: You know why that is, don’t you?\nSALIM: Are you going to say it’s because she’s British?\nJESSICA: We're all thinking it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 86. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Flip. It’s good to hear your voice again. Try not to panic, the situation is under control.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) No, you’ve got to listen.\nJYOTI: (INTO MIC) Flip, it’s okay. Just hang on and we’1l rescue you. Won’t we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Of course we will.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Jyoti! You got away, that’s so good. I was afraid you’d been snatched too, like me and Anarkali.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Anarkali?! Did you say —\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Anarkali, yeah. She was here in Scavenger before me, until her mind got absorbed into it. She wrote a message on the wall, in blood: “Ah, could I behold the face of my beloved...”\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) What do you mean, absorbed?\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Anarkali. She was writing this while she was being absorbed, many centuries ago, before Scavenger went to sleep.\nJYOTI: Why was that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: My guess is, Scavenger’s alien masters sent it to Earth to look for high technology. When it didn’t find anything it could use in the seventeenth century, it put itself into hibernation, waiting until Earth’s technology was sufficiently developed to be worth scavenging.\nJYOTI: Or until it got woken up.\nDOCTOR: Until I woke it up, unfortunately. (CROSS TO:)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 87. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL [CONTINUOUS ]\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) It’s so sad, Doctor. She wrote this note to her Prince. I know that because now I’m starting to absorb it, starting to feel how she felt.\nSALIM: (HUSHED) “The face of my beloved...”\nJESSICA: Salim? Are you okay?\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Anarkali is with you? Now?\nSALIM: You want something for so long. So long. Every day I wake up and I’m still alive, I’m still here. I couldn’t die while she was gone.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Not exactly. It’s like she’s around, somehow. But she’s helping me work something out, I think.\nSALIM: (INTO MIC) Anarkali, can you hear me?

Is this re-entry?\nJYOTI: (INTO MIC) You’re in the Salvage 2 ship and it’s taking you to a low-level Earth orbit.\nDOCTOR: Of course, it’s Scavenger. It’s trying to batter its way out of Salvage 2!\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKER) Salvage 2 containment weakening. System assessing enemy assets.\nDOCTOR: (TO JYOTI) I’ve got to get to her. How do I get to her?\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Doctor, Anarkali says Scavenger is about to do something.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) So am I. Hold fast, Flip. I’m on my way.\nJYOTI: Doctor — I thought Scavenger would only absorb your box, your TARDIS, if you went there in it?\nDOCTOR: Most likely it will. But I don’t see I’m left with any other option, do you?\nJYOTI: Brilliant. I’1ll get my camera.\nDOCTOR: No. Jyoti, stay here.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 116\nJYOTI: You just don’t want me in your box.\nDOCTOR: I’m taking this headset, so I can patch it through the TARDIS scanner.

Everything it knows of the Earth is of the Earth as it was in my time. But you, you know everything about the Earth in the present day.\nFLIP: Yeah, it might come a bit unstuck with that.\nANARKALI: That is what it wants.

ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nSALIM: It’s whipped right around the Earth and is flying over Pakistan. Wait, now crossing into Rjasthan. So fast!\nDOCTOR: How can it get that speed in low Earth orbit?\nSALIM: It’s not risen above the ionosphere. It’s achieving that speed in atmosphere.\nJESSICA: Compare tech specs later, would you? It’s slowing down.\nDOCTOR: And heading for —\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/SALIM: (SIMULTANEOUSLY) New Delhi.\nDOCTOR: Why there? It’s a lovely city but why there? Why now?\nSALIM: A lot of the flight software was written in New Delhi. Does it know that? How could it know that?\nDOCTOR: It knows everything Salvage 2 knows.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 99. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: Oh, I can breathe again. (HEAVES) Where are we?\nANARKALT: Hastinapur.\nSCAVENGER: New program. Clean Up Earth begins. Cycling weapon emitters. Firing.\nFLIP: Scavenger, no!!!\nFLIP: (F/X FROM INSIDE — SCAVENGER BEGINS FIRING LASERS DOWN ON NEW\nDELHI.

(BEAT) That is some technology.\nDOCTOR: What it’s doing is cleaning up Earth.\nSALIM: Cleaning up Earth-?!\nDOCTOR: Scavenger seems to have got its wires crossed. Right now, it sees humankind as — well, junk. (INTO MIC) Scavenger, this is the Doctor. Your program is in error. Shut down and stand by for further instructions. Repeat, shut down and stand by for [further instructions. ]\nJESSICA: It’s not listening, Doctor. (INTO PHONE) Jessica Allaway, authority niner-niner-seven. Get me missile command right now.\nDOCTOR: Ms Allaway, please! I’1l think of something!!!\nJESSICA: I don’t see what. Tell me you really think this ‘Flip’ person is more important than the lives of everyone in New Delhi? (INTO PHONE) Missile Command, this is your second authorisation. No countermands. Launch when ready.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 101. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: Scavenger! Cease firing!\nFLIP: Nothing. Nothing.\nANARKALT: Scavenger, this is your host. Stop.\nSCAVENGER: Identification: Anarkali.\nFLIP: Great, it’s listening to you.\nSCAVENGER: Identification: host replaced. Host updated. Purging previous host.\nFLIP: No! Scavenger! I’m your new host, listen to me. Tactical advantage to keeping Anarkali! She’s — it’s — she’s — she — she knows Salim! She knows people on Earth right now.\nSCAVENGER: Purge cancelled.\nANARKALT: Thank you. You saved me.\nFLIP: Yeah, well, hurry up and help me think of a tactical reason to make Scavenger stop firing! — I seriously need some tactics.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 102. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nJESSICA: Well, Spaceguard is useful, isn’t it, Doctor? Look. I’d say that’s a full-strike complement of missiles. In the air. Unstoppable.\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKER) Incoming targets.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Doctor? Doctor, help me! Help me think of a reason to make it stop!\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) I can’t. Flip, I need you to think of somewhere far away. Of a journey you’d like to make.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) What-?\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKER) Missiles ranged and focused.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Missiles-?! Scavenger doesn’t have m—\nDOCTOR: Please, Flip. Close your eyes. Focus.\nSALIM: Contact in twenty seconds.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) I get it. The missiles aren’t Scavenger’s. They’re coming at Scavenger, aren’t they? They’re shooting Scavenger down, and me with it!\nDOCTOR: I mean it, Flip. Think of somewhere far away. It won’t hurt if you think of some place far away.\nJESSICA: “Some place far away.” It’s what they say to prisoners facing execution, isn’t it? They say it helps.\nSALIM: Ten seconds to impact. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. —\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 130\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) I’ve been everywhere, Doctor. You’ve taken me everywhere I wanted to go.

Scavenger took off for its next destination before Flip had even finished thinking where it was she wanted to go.\nJESSICA: What-?\nDOCTOR: Flip is becoming part of Scavenger. Its host. I gambled that Flip’s desire to be elsewhere would override Scavenger’s desire to clean up Earth. For now, it seems I was right. (INTO MIC) Flip? Flip, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (F/X YOU KNOW THOSE SCI-FI FILMS THAT SHOW ACCELERATION BY BLASTING THE HEROES’ FACES WITH WIND SO MUCH THAT THEIR SKIN RIPPLES? THAT’S WHAT IS HAPPENING TO FLIP.)\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) CAN’T — CAN’/T TALK!\nJESSICA: And yet she does.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) We’re going to try to get a fix on you. Just hold on a little while longer.\nSALIM: Doctor — does this mean Anarkali has cheated death, too?\nDOCTOR: Salim — I’m sorry, but Anarkali cannot still be alive. She has to have died hundreds of years ago. Flip is alone up there. Physically, at least.\nJESSICA: If Salim here really is as old as he says, if Scavenger’s beam did that to him — well, why can’t his girlfriend be alive?\nSALIM: Now she believes. Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: Salim, you and Anarkali were probed by the same beam and your ageing was stalled. But that has to have been a byproduct. Scavenger needs hosts and it protects them, it goes to huge lengths to protect them, but only for as long as it takes to absorb them into its workings. One hour, that’s what it said.\nSALIM: I feel ill.\nJESSICA: Anarkali’s mind was scavenged and then it let her body die. Starved to death.\nDOCTOR: Scavenger was in orbit, I daresay Anarkali would have died from oxygen starvation first. It would have been quick.\nSALIM: Died between those two walls.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But that’s what’s going to happen to Flip, as soon as her absorption is complete. And we’ve got less than an hour to stop it.\nSALIM: Then — then we must do what we can to bring her home.\nJESSICA: Got to catch her first.\nDOCTOR: Is that Scavenger’s trail?\nJESSICA: It’s changing course like mad. It was heading for the Azores a minute ago, then Malta. Now it looks like... Crete?\nSALIM: Your friend was thinking of all those places at once?\nDOCTOR: No. Only one.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 104. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: At last. Slowing down.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Flip? Flip, can you hear me?\nFLIP: Just about. Still wedged, by the way. Any time you want to rescue me from wherever we’ve got to...\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Exactly where you thought of. Exactly where you told me where you wanted to visit, all that time ago, back on Tranquillity...?\nFLIP: Atlantis? Seriously?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 105. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL [CONTINUOUS]\nJESSICA: (SCORNFUL) Atlantis!\nSALIM: Where in the world is Atlantis?\nDOCTOR: Atlantis is... complicated. There are several possible places it might be. It looks like Scavenger’s trying them all.\nJESSICA: At least it won’t be ‘cleaning up’ any more cities, while it’s trying to make up its mind.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. (INTO MIC) Scavenger, report status.\nFLIP: (IN SCAVENGER-LIKE VOICE) Did you do that... Doctor? Did you rescue me from inbound targets, full-strike spread, no compass gap, no altitude gap, ranged and bearing, brace for impact, launch log and —\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 106. INT. SCAVENGER [CONTINUOUS ]\nFLIP: (BACK TO HER OWN VOICE) Doctor, it’s using my voice! Doctor!\nANARKALT: Scavenger is absorbing you. You are absorbing Scavenger.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) I’m afraid you and Scavenger are merging.\nFLIP: That’s what she just said.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Sorry? I didn’t hear anyone.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 107. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL [CONTINUOUS]\nSALIM: Doctor, she doesn’t believe she’s alone up there.\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Doctor? Doctor, it’s Jyoti onboard the Mandela.\nDOCTOR: Hold on, Flip. Important message coming through.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 108. INT. MANDELA — BRIDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nJYOTI: Doctor, the Mandela’s coming off alert and the crew’s going to be returning to the bridge soon. I can’t stay for much longer.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Quickly, then. Let’s take stock of our assets. Is anything docked with the Mandela right now?\nJYOTI: Nothing. Well, two food supply drones.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Can you fly them?\nJYOTI: I said, they’re empty drones, no pilots.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Yes, but can you fly them?\nJYOTI: I can control them remotely from the Mandela, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 109. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL [CONTINUOUS ]\nDOCTOR: Check their status, Jyoti. Fuel capacity, maximum speeds, the lot.\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Okay, hold on, I’1ll be —\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) [1I’11] just talk to myself, shall I? Sorry, Anarkali, I know you’re here too.\nSALIM: What did she say-?\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) I mean, who’s so important? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Flip, do you remember the name of the astronaut you saved on the Mandela?\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Course I do! — Oh, I get it. This is like, ‘what day is it, who’s the Prime Minister’?\nDOCTOR: Something like that, yes.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Jyoti. Jyoti Cutler. And my useless boyf, his name’s Jared, and my even more useless little brother, he’s Philip. Satisfied?\nDOCTOR: Philip? That’s.. interesting.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Philippa and Philip, yeah. Do you think they wanted a boy much?\nSALIM: I can’t take this. (INTO MIC) Flip, put Anarkali on.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER, CALLING) Yeah, alright. Anarkali? Anarkali, the Prince here wants to talk to you!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 140\nSALIM: I can’t hear anything. Why can’t I hear anything?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER, ASIDE) I told you, Salim — Anarkali was absorbed centuries ago. She’s speaking in Flip’s head because Flip is also being absorbed.\nSALIM: She is — in Flip...?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER, ASIDE) Inside the host. Best if we don’t let on for now.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Alright, you two, we'll get you a room soon enough. Happy now, your highness?\nSALIM: (LYING) Yes. Thank you, Flip.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) No worries. — Hold up, Scavenger’s slowing.\nFLIP: Wherever we are, I think we’ve arrived.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 141\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Scavenger, report status please.\nFLIP: (AS SCAVENGER) Identification: Atlantis. (BEAT) Correction. Identification not possible. (AS HERSELF) I could’ve told you that. There’s no such place, I just remember it from a TV show. (BEAT) No, I don’t know anything more than that. (BEAT) It’s like talking to yourself. Anarkali, how do you stand it? ...\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 111. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) .. Anarkali?\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Stand by, Flip. (F/X SWITCHES MIC OFF) Jessica, Salim. Scavenger has come to a halt right where it thinks Atlantis was.\nJESSICA: The Canary Islands?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Completely wrong, of course, but that’s not important now. (INTO MIC) Jyoti? Are you there, Jyoti?\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Still here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Tell me about those drones aboard the Mandela.\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) They’re both about fifty percent fuelled. Typical re-entry path takes four orbits, so we could get them to Scavenger if you need.\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Then they’1l do.\nSALIM: Why? What are you planning, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I can’t land aboard Scavenger in my TARDIS, not without the risk of Scavenger scavenging its technology. I can’t give away the TARDIS’s secrets so easily.\nJESSICA: Pity.\nSALIM: So you’re going to save Flip, how?\nDOCTOR: By putting herself in my place. I flatter myself that Scavenger will view me as a rather more tempting host. I fly to Scavenger in the first drone, allow myself to be scavenged, release Flip into the second drone... and have Jyoti fly her back to the Mandela.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 143\nSALIM: Even if your plan works, that won’t stop Scavenger.\nDOCTOR: My mind won’t be quite so easily absorbed, I hope. If it comes to a battle of wills between me and that machine, I might be able to batter it into submission.\nJESSICA: ‘Might’!\nDOCTOR: It’s a risk, I admit, but it’s the best I have to offer against the certainty that very soon, Scavenger will complete its absorption of Flip and set about cleaning up Earth again. (INTO MIC) Jyoti? Are you still there?\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Still here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Get those drones ready to launch. I’1ll be at the Mandela supply bay in just a few moments.\nJYOTI: Can’t meet you there, I’m afraid. I’ve had to barricade the flight crew out of the bridge.\nDOCTOR: What?\nJYOTI: Yeah, I don’t think the Commander’s at all happy about it.\nDOCTOR: No matter, so long as you can fly those drones. I’m on my way. In the meantime, my friend Salim will fill you in on the plan.\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Hurry up, then. (BEAT) The Commander’s trying to cut through the bulkhead, I think.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP) Salim, Ms Allaway. Try to behave yourselves in my absence. (WALKING TO TARDIS) I’1l be back later.\nJESSICA: No, you won’t.\nDOCTOR: (F/X OPENING THE TARDIS DOOR) Do you know, people usually believe me when I say that?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 144\nSALIM: Go, Doctor. Do what you can for your friend.\nJESSICA: If he does come back, I am having that box of his.\nSALIM: (INTO MIC) Jyoti? Miss Cutler? The plan is this —\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: (OVER SPEAKER) This isn’t Jyoti Cutler. This is Gabbard, on the Mandela.\nSALIM: Commander Gabbard?\nJYOTI: (OFF, OVER SPEAKER) I’m sorry-!\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: Miss Cutler is relieved of duty, pending an investigation into her actions in the aftermath of the collision earlier today. The collision caused by your ‘Clean Up Space’ mission — Mister Jahangir!\nSALIM: I can explain everything —\nCOMMANDER GABBARD: Explain it to the inquiry. Mandela out.\nJESSICA: There goes the Doctor’s plan.\nSALIM: Then we shall have to think of an alternative.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 112. INT. SCAVENGER\nFLIP: (WEAKENING) Doctor... please, hurry...\nANARKALT: You are nearly absorbed. It was at this point that I wrote my message for Salim.\nFLIP: I’m not writing anything in blood, thank you very much. The Doctor’s on his way. The Doctor’1ll fix it. I know he will. I just wish he’d hurry up about it.\nANARKALTI: Don’t be afraid.\nFLIP: I’m not — okay, you already know, of course you already know. I’m a little scared. Okay?\nANARKALT: It will not hurt. Scavenger repairs as it replaces.\nFLIP: How does that work, then?\nANARKALT: Feel your arm, Flip. Is it still broken?\nFLIP: Course it is, it can’t just mend — hang about. It’s alright, it’s fixed. My arm’s alright!\nANARKALT: Just as your strange suit has been repaired, and the bottled air you brought has been replenished.\nFLIP: Sixty minutes on the oxygen counter. How’d it do that, without my noticing?\nANARKALT: Just as your mind is becoming part of Scavenger, so your body is becoming part of Scavenger, too.\nFLIP: So Scavenger thinks my spacesuit is part of me — that’s why it’s fixed it, right?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 146\nANARKALT: Scavenger needs you in perfect condition, to be perfectly absorbed.\nFLIP: (SOTTO) Big mistake, Scavenger. Big, big mistake!\nANARKALT: What are you thinking, Flip? Scavenger wants to know.\nFLIP: If my mind is in Scavenger’s, Scavenger can see for itself, can’t it?\nANARKALT: Scavenger sees... ice. It feels... cold. It sees you alone, flying above a frozen lake on a.. “micro-lite”? Is this is a memory of yours?\nFLIP: No kidding.\nANARKALT: It sees you with someone called... Dare? You at the controls of technological device called a... a “tele-port”!\nFLIP: I’m seeing you now, in Lahore, all those years ago. The pink beam that took you away, remember? That’s how Scavenger brought us here, me and you both. By teleport!\nANARKALI: You know what “teleport” is?\nFLIP: Do I ever. That’s how I got here.. and that’s how I’m getting off!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 113. INT. ISRA — MISSION CONTROL\nSALIM: There, that’s freed it.\nJESSICA: The flight computer for Salvage 2? What d’you need that for?\nSALIM: Never you mind.\nJESSICA: Oh, I get it. You think destroying that’s going to help bury the evidence of your sabotage? I’ve got news for you, Salim —\nSALIM: Everything’s backed up remotely, I know. And I’m not destroying at.\nJESSICA: Well, what exactly are you doing with it, then?\nDOCTOR: Well, that didn’t go according to plan.\nJESSICA: Doctor! Did you not get the welcome you were hoping for aboard the Mandela?\nDOCTOR: Two surprisingly burly astronauts tried to arrest me when I landed in the supply drone bay.\nJESSICA: What, so you ran away?\nDOCTOR: Discretion is sometimes the better part of valour, Ms Allaway. More to the point, I wouldn’t exactly have been in a position to enact Plan B — would I now?\nJESSICA: You’re just making it up as you go along!\nDOCTOR: All will become clear. Salim — what are you doing, disconnecting that flight computer?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 148\nSALIM: Just salvaging what I can from Salvage 2.\nDOCTOR: Oh, really? Because for a moment there I thought you might have been hoping to tempt Scavenger into some sort of exchange.\nJESSICA: What do you mean, ‘exchange’?\nDOCTOR: Scavenger grabbed both Flip and Anarkali by means of what I can only describe as a teleport beam. It finds itself a suitable host, then teleports them aboard in order to absorb them.\nJESSICA: So?\nSALIM: So the Doctor and I are about to argue over which of us will offer ourselves up as an alternative host, in exchange for PLip:\nDOCTOR: I believe that Salim intends to take the flight computer with him. A piece of high technology to offer as some kind of sweetener?\nJESSICA: Oh, a bribe! Fair enough, I get that.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid, Salim, that it’s a very meagre offering, compared to the contents of a Time Lord’s brain.\nSALIM: Let me, Doctor. Anarkali was absorbed. If I am too, it will be a kind of being together.\nDOCTOR: Scavenger rejected you once before, remember?\nSALIM: I got over my cough five centuries ago. It will take me.\nDOCTOR: And I woke up Scavenger. Unintentionally, I admit, and only because you, my friend, set the process in motion. But nonetheless, this is my responsibility. (INTO MIC) Doctor to Scavenger. Status update, please.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 114. INT. SCAVENGER [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: Doctor! You’re back! Just hold on, I’m busy —\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Busy doing what?\nFLIP: Just poking around Scavenger with my mind. Looking for the teleport controls. (SOTTO) Don’t tell Scavenger, but I’m hoping I can find a way to beam myself right out of here.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.\nFLIP: It’s alright, Scavenger knows what I’m doing. But it’s absorbed so much of me, there’s not a lot it can do about it.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Sever the mental link between yourself and Scavenger too abruptly, and you could cause terrible damage to your mind.\nFLIP: Then I’1l fit right back in, back on the checkout at Freshgoods, won’t I?\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Freshgoods? Who’s talking about Freshgoods?\nFLIP: Doctor, please! I’m trying to concentrate!\nANARKALT: Tell him you’ve reached the — you’re calling it a hard disk? So many new words. New ideas.\nFLIP: Not sure I’m doing it right, though. I put a bigger drive in my PC once. Wished I hadn’t started. It was all drivers and jumpers and throwing salt over my shoulder —\nSCAVENGER: Identification: Jared.\nFLIP: Alright, it was Jared did it. But I bought the drive. Blimey, you can tell Scavenger’s a man, can’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 150\nANARKALT: Computers sound wonderful. I expect a slave girl like me would never have had one.\nFLIP: You’d have had a smartphone with a computer in it. It would be tiny and very fashionable. (BEAT) I’ve found something. So strange to be poking about with my mind and finding things. But I think this is a kind of app store.\nSCAVENGER: Security. Owner authentication required.\nANARKALTI: I don’t know what that means.\nFLIP: It means that, unless you know who built Scavenger and what their favourite password is, we’ve reached a dead end. It’s not like the password will be ‘Scavenger’.\nSCAVENGER: Authentication: failed.\nFLIP: No! No! I was kidding!\nSCAVENGER: Security breach detected.

Earth’s close to the Kessler tipping point, when we won’t be able to launch anything into space at all. But if Britain had Scavenger technology... And no-one else did...\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Flip, how much air is in Scavenger?\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Not to worry, my tanks are topped up, thanks to Scavenger. I’m all ready to go, just as soon [as]\nDOCTOR: That’s not what I meant!\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 119. INT. SCAVENGER [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: Trying to concentrate, Doctor! I’m keeping my helmet open while I check out the teleport. I tell you, I’m an expert. I could get a job doing this, if they had them in 2011.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) No, Flip, seal your helmet. Scavenger’s reaching orbit, you can’t have more than moments of air.\nFLIP: There! Doctor, I’ve got it, I’ve got the hunt-gather teleport log! Right: helmet on...\nFLIP: (F/X CLUNK-CLICK AS SHE SEALS HELMET. IT SNAPS SHUT WITH A HISS OF OXYGEN.

All I have to do is, well ‘undo’ the last journey in the log, aaaand...\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKER) Stupid girl, it isn’t safe!\nFLIP: I know what I’m doing! Sending the ‘undo’ command — now.\nFLIP: The pink beam! It’s here! I can see it!

We need to rescan, see if we can pick up her helmet mic.\nSALIM: No time for that, Scavenger needs a replacement host — and it’s going to get one! (INTO MIC) Scavenger, it’s me, Salim. Crown Prince Salim, remember me?\nSCAVENGER: (OVER SPEAKER) Replacement host identified.\nSALIM: You’re talking to me, you must be in range. Can you lock onto the source of my transmission?\nDOCTOR: Salim, Anarkali is dead, and you won’t be able to hold out against Scavenger.\nSALIM: Jessica — pick up that flight computer, will you?\nJESSICA: I don’t fetch and carry!\nSALIM: I don’t want you to. I want you to whack the Doctor on the head with it.\nDOCTOR: Salim, don’t be absurd— (WHACKED; COLLAPSES UNCONSCIOUS)\nJESSICA: What can I say? He twisted my arm.\nSALIM: Now, give it to me. (CALLING) Scavenger! I’m here! I’m ready!\nJESSICA: There it is. You really think you can control Scavenger, Slim?\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit)\nSALIM: I know I can. But if I can’t — nuke me.\nJESSICA: Don’t worry, I will.\nSALIM: (STEPPING INTO THE BEAM) Anarkali, I’m coming to\nSALIM: Page 156\nSALIM: you.\nSALIM: Anarkali\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 121.

(CALLING) Indian Space Research Control, can you hear me?\nJESSICA: (OVER SPEAKER) I hear you, Slim.\nSALIM: Jessica, I’ve got to read you something. While I still can. Anarkali wrote me a message and it’s right here on the two walls. (STRUGGLES TO BREATH) Scavenger, faster. It reads: “Ah!

Can’t say my hopes are high.\nDOCTOR: I wonder if..? No, doesn’t matter. First things first: Jessica, I’d appreciate it if you could help me locate Flip.\nJESSICA: You’ve got no idea where she is?\nDOCTOR: She undid the first journey she took via teleport — so I'd assume she’s somewhere in orbit.

Every night since I have watched you. A star alone. (ALOUD) Scavenger, have you processed my offering?\nSCAVENGER: Flight computer salvaged and integrated. Uploading new instructions.\nANARKALT: What does that mean, my lord?\nSALIM: I’m sorry, my love.

All this time, it’s been uploading to the cloud!\nJYOTI: (OVER SPEAKER) Is it worth checking, you think, to see if it caught her?\nDOCTOR: (FX: FURIOUS TYPING) Already on it, Jyoti! That’s the data stream there... (F/X REWINDING NOISES) Back... let’s say, twenty minutes? And... play.\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) [it is] cold out here. Colder than the icy ice caves of Iceland.\nDOCTOR: There she is! There’s Flip!\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Okay, so. Floating in space. Not my scene. If you’re getting this, Doctor, floating in space is not my scene. That’s why I’m not planning on sticking a — oh, look, there’s India! Hello, India! I’m waving at a country, how mad is that?\nFLIP: It’s a great view, though. Gotta admit, it is a great view. I knew, Doctor, when you took me to the Mandela; I knew what that was all about. Show me the Earth, make me feel homesick; make me feel like maybe the holiday’s over, and it’s time I went home.\nDOCTOR: No, no. That wasn’t it at all —\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) Ohh, don’t deny it. I can hear you, denying it.\nFLIP: It’s alright, I get it, you want to move on. You want to go off and find your friend Peri. Don’t want a daft liability like me, having accidents and incidents and making things worse all the\nFLIP: time.\nFLIP: Look, thing is, I can’t hang around here waiting for you to find me. Only gonna run out of air or depressurise or something. Lucky for me, I’m wearing the suit, the Baumgartner suit, with these sort of thrusters in the boots, that’s how it works. You jump. Jump to Earth. I’m guessing people don’t usually jump from as high as this, but they jump all the same.\nDOCTOR WHO: SCAVENGER by William Gallagher (003-NB edit) Page 166\nDOCTOR: From the edge of space, maybe, not from actual space! (‘IS SHE MAD?') Fl-i-i-p!\nFLIP: (OVER SPEAKER) I know, I know, it’s a bit of a risk, I don’t blame you for telling me off. And I promise, really promise, that if I land safely I am never, never ever, no really, never gonna do anything as daft as this again. I’m going back to Freshgoods, back to me Mum and yeah, back to Jared too, I expect.\nFLIP: Can’t think of anything else to say, really.\nFLIP: Alright, mind made up. I’m doing this. Thrusters to burn.\nFLIP: Okay, turning myself around. Head-first — ooh, scary. Gotta let the camera go now, so... see you around, Doctor. On the ground, I hope.\nFLIP: . Alright, here goes nothing. (CAMERA DRIFTING AWAY) India or bust, Doctor...! (JUMPS)\nDOCTOR: (AGHAST) Flip...\nFLIP: Wuuuuuvaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nFLIP: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME."
