There’s a view down to the river from this clearing. We might see them from here.\nMERTIL: Sesha, I said hold tight.\nSESHA: (STOPPED) The night-lighter won’t have the range, Mertil. The Takers had too much of a head start.\nMERTIL: This was your father’s own strategy. He knew the Takers would return. This is our chance to take the fight to them.\nSESHA: But if they’ve reached the river with him, we’ll have lost him.\nHERVEY: It.. might be worth a look. We might see tracks they’ve left.\nSESHA: Hervey, we must keep going. We might catch them up.\nMERTIL: Set up the night-lighter, boy. Wait — hand scrub first.\nSESHA: We don’t have time for that!\nMERTIL: We won’t help Anulf by falling sick now. Do it — both of you.\nMERTIL: (FX: SCOOSH OF HAND SANITISER DISPENSERS AND SCRUBBING OF HANDS. IN THE PAUSE, BRING UP THE SOUND OF THE SHADES A LITTLE LOUDER)\nHERVEY: Listen. Lots of Shades about.\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 3\nSESHA: They’re always out in force when the Takers come.\nHERVEY: The forest’s alive with them tonight.\nMERTIL: They can’t hurt you. Come on, the night-lighter.\nHERVEY: Too many shadows... No, hold tight — is that...?\nSESHA: It’s only Jestan’s group. Must be trying to head the Takers off.\nMERTIL: Try to the east, boy.\nSESHA: I’m telling you, Mertil, this is a waste of time. Don’t you want Anulf to be found? (BEAT) Do what you want. I’m going.\nHERVEY: Brother Anulf ruled that only groups of three or more were allowed in the forest.\nMERTIL: After what happened to your mother, Sesha, I’m surprised [you’d\nMERTIL: —]\nSESHA: That’s Sister Sesha. Right now, I decide what’s allowed in the Bay, Mertil. If anything happens to Brother Anulf, powers of governing pass to his first-born. Not to his second wife.\nMERTIL: You have emergency powers only.\nSESHA: And this is an emergency. Or do you need the night-lighter to show you that too?\nHERVEY: Sister Sesha!\nMERTIL: She has no respect for anything. For the sake of Purity, I hope the situation is soon resolved.\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 4\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE NOISE OF THE SHADES GETS SLOWLY LOUDER UNDER DIALOGUE TO END OF SCENE)\nHERVEY: No one Taken has ever been found.\nMERTIL: Anulf was still strong, boy. He will have resisted, slowed them down. And the Shades trail the Takers. We’ll get to Jestan’s group, get them and any others to search areas with the most Shades. Maybe this time we’ll finally find out where they hide, and deal with them once and for all. Bring the night-lighter. (BEAT) Scrub first.\nHERVEY: But I just did.\nMERTIL: Do it properly this time. Not just your fingers.\nMERTIL: (FX: THE SCOOSHING OF THE SANITISER, SCRUBBING OF HANDS, THE\nCREEPY: NOISE OF THE SHADES)\nMERTIL: The Shades can’t hurt us. But this dirt, boy. The unclean air. The muck all around us — that’s different. Scrub harder. If we drop our guard... that’s when we’re dead.\nMERTIL: SCENE 2: EXT. ELSEWHERE IN ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nMERTIL: (FX: TARDIS LANDS. EXTERIOR TARDIS DOOR OPENS. THE SOUND OF THE\nSHADES: HAS DROPPED FROM LAST SCENE BUT GRADUALLY INCREASES\nTHROUGH: THIS ONE)\nDOCTOR: Ah. Step carefully, you three. We’ve landed at night.\nNYSSA: Shall I fetch the torches, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No need, Nyssa. That moon’s looking fairly full. Just wait for your eyes to adjust.\nTURLOUGH: It’s a forest.\nTEGAN: Thanks for pointing that out, Turlough. Where are we?\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 5\nDOCTOR: A long way from the Earth, Tegan. This is the planet of Chodor, out on the eastern edge of Aldebaran. No strategic importance, no mineral wealth, overlooked by most travellers.\nTURLOUGH: Is there any particular reason why we’re here?\nDOCTOR: I suggested to the TARDIS she have a little listen-in on the mutterings of the universe.. Asked her to prick up her metaphorical ears at any mention of Richter’s Syndrome.\nTURLOUGH: Can the TARDIS really do that?\nDOCTOR: We'll find out, once we’ve explored a little.\nTEGAN: Exploring a dark forest in the middle of the night on a world where anyone we meet might have space-rabies?\nNYSSA: They won’t, not once I’ve tried out the cure.\nTURLOUGH: She hopes.\nNYSSA: I’m grateful for your help, all of you.\nTURLOUGH: What’s that noise?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Some kind of atmospheric disturbance?\nNYSSA: It’s almost like... voices.\nDOCTOR: Probably just this planet’s version of cicadas, ov...\nTEGAN: Or something else.\nTEGAN: (THEN, IN THE DISTANCE THEY HEAR ANULF, WHO’S BEING MANHANDLED\nAWAY: BY SILENT ASSAILANTS )\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 6\nANULF: I won’t be taken. Do you hear me? I won’t let you. [Why do you do this? Why take so many from Purity, always in silence? ]\nDOCTOR: Someone’s in trouble.\nTEGAN: Come on.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLS) Is that wise? (GRAB’S NYSSA’S ARM) Nyssa, wait!\nNYSSA: Turlough, let go of my arm-!\nTURLOUGH: But we don’t know the whole situation!\nNYSSA: We never will if we don’t investigate — agh.\nTURLOUGH: Are you all right? What is it?\nNYSSA: Those sounds in the air.. Don’t you hear them? Like... whispers...\nNYSSA: The noises are coming from that direction. They’re coming at us!\nTURLOUGH: And the TARDIS is locked. Oh, wonderful.\nNYSSA: We have to get away.\nTURLOUGH: Well come on, then!\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: EXT. CLIFFTOP FROM ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (DOCTOR AND TEGAN CRASH THROUGH FOLIAGE AND STOP RUNNING, A\nLITTLE: SHORT OF BREATH)\nDOCTOR: Hello?\nTEGAN: He’s stopped shouting, we’ve got nothing to follow. You don’t think he went over the cliff edge and drowned?\nDOCTOR: It sounded to me more as though he were taken deeper into the forest...\nDOCTOR: I should've let Nyssa bring the torches — (BEAT) Where IS Nyssa?\nTEGAN: Miles behind, I expect. With Turlough.\nDOCTOR: Oh, well, I’m sure they’1ll be along in just a moment. (CALLS) Nyssa! Turlough!\nTEGAN: Ssh! Those sounds in the air again.. like whispers...\nTEGAN: (FX: OFF, SESHA CRASHING THROUGH FOREST. SHADES NOISE RECEDES\nOVER: NEXT FEW LINES)\nDOCTOR: Ah, I hear them now! (CALLING) Nyssa, Turlough, over here —\nDOCTOR: (SESHA APPEARS FROM THE UNDERGROWTH. THROUGHOUT THIS SCENE SHE IS FIGHTING TO STAY TOUGH AND DETACHED WHILE OUT OF HER DEPTH)\nSESHA: (SHOCKED) Hold tight.\nDOCTOR: Oh! Er — hello!\nSESHA: In Sir John’s name, what are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 8\nDOCTOR: Friendly. There’s no need to be afraid. Come closer. We’re not armed, you can put down the club and the... (SNIFFS) soap?\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Smells like carbolic. (REACTS TO SESHA’S APPEARANCE,\nSTARTS: FORWARD) Your skin! It looks burned, are you all right?\nSESHA: Stay back. I am Sister Sesha, Sesha of Anulf.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) She’s a nun?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Or a nurse.\nSESHA: (AGGRESSIVE) With my father gone, I am Purity Bay’s Leader. Are you Takers?\nTEGAN: We haven’t taken anything.\nDOCTOR: Only the time to see if we could help a man we heard calling for help.\nSESHA: (BREATHES) Father? (STILL SUSPICIOUS) Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor.\nSESHA: A doctor? That’s impossible.\nDOCTOR: Really? Who do you call when you’re sick?\nSESHA: ‘Doctor’ is an ancient name of power. There have been no doctors for so long. It is impossible.\nDOCTOR: Well, as Aristotle said: a likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility.\nSESHA: (MOCKING) You’1ll tell me next she’s Sir John.\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 9\nTEGAN: I’m Tegan. Tegan Jovanka.\nDOCTOR: Sir John is another ancient name of power, I take it.\nSESHA: Where are you from?\nTEGAN: Here and there.\nDOCTOR: We’re travellers. (STEPS FORWARD) Pleased to meet you —\nSESHA: Get back. You must be with the Takers. What have you done with my father?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, we know nothing about these Takers — (BEAT) Ev... Sister Sesha?\nSESHA: (FASCINATED) Your skin, it’s like newborns’...\nTEGAN: Er, thanks.\nSESHA: And your hair, it’s so long. It breaks every law. What about\nSESHA: dirt, germs, infection...\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I don’t follow.\nSESHA: Whoever or whatever you are — you should be dead.\nSESHA: SCENE 4: EXT. CLEARING IN ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nSESHA: (NYSSA HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH TURLOUGH RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST. THEY’VE BOTH STOPPED. OUT OF BREATH. )\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, finally! What’s wrong with you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 10\nNYSSA: I could hear them.. The Shades... Not clearly, but the sound of words.\nTURLOUGH: You’re not making sense.\nNYSSA: The whispering things — the Shades. I think that’s what they call themselves.\nTURLOUGH: Why would you think that?\nNYSSA: I half-heard so many words... like someone was trying to force the sounds through my ears. (SIGHS) I just need to rest a moment.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t suppose a moment matters. We’ve lost the Doctor and Tegan completely by now. Still, at least we got away from your Shades.\nNYSSA: No.\nTURLOUGH: What d’you mean? The muttering’s all but stopped. Your Shades have gone.\nNYSSA: But we didn’t get away from them. The Shades simply... lost interest.\nTURLOUGH: What was that?\nTURLOUGH: NYSSA3: What?\nTURLOUGH: I thought... I thought someone was there... watching.\nNYSSA: You’re getting jumpy.\nNYSSA: 10\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: EXT. ADJACENT TO CLEARING. NIGHT.\nHERVEY: (WHISPERS) Mertil, you were right, there are.. Sir John heal me, there are strangers.\nMERTIL: They made enough noise. They cannot fear discovery. (BEAT) Hervey, fetch the search party here. I will stay to watch them. If they leave, I will mark the trees to show the path.\nHERVEY: But if they see you, they might kill you.\nMERTIL: Go! Hurry, boy.\nMERTIL: (WHISPERS) I cannot be hurt. Let doctors see my skin is pure. Let Sir John’s blade show my heart is pure. (SCRUBS HARDER, IT HURTS). I... am pure.\nMERTIL: SCENE 6: EXT. CLIFFTOP FROM ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: Sister Sesha, please don’t let cultural differences blind you to the fact that Tegan and I are trying to help you.\nTEGAN: We’re not plague carriers.\nDOCTOR: And if my hair offends you, I’1ll wear a hat. (PULLS OUT HAT AND\nWEARS: IT) How’s that? However our appearance might differ from yours, you really have nothing to fear.\nSESHA: I’m not afraid. (BEAT) The Shades have moved on - that’s a sure Sign the Takers have gone too.\nTEGAN: Shades? The funny noise in the air, you mean?\nTEGAN: 11\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 12\nSESHA: So there are no Shades where you come from, as well as no scrubs...\nDOCTOR: What are they? These Shades?\nSESHA: They can’t hurt you, ‘Doctor’. (SHE ENJOYS USING THE WORD OF POWER, PRONOUNCES IT SLIGHTLY ODDLY) I must return to the hunt. If I don’t find my father tonight...\nDOCTOR: Please. Let us help you.\nSESHA: No. Hold tight here. I shall be back to speak with you again.\nTEGAN: Bye, then. (TO DOCTOR) Well, come on then, Doctor. Now’s our chance.\nDOCTOR: Chance...?\nTEGAN: Couldn’t we just slip away, find Nyssa and Turlough, get back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: We could. But if Nyssa and Turlough are lost out there with these Takers, Sesha’s support could be important to us.\nTEGAN: Come off it. You just want to dig around this Purity Bay of theirs and find out what’s going on.\nDOCTOR: I’d say there was something rotten in the state of Chodor, wouldn’t you?\nTEGAN: Rotten? Sterilised to within an inch of its life, you mean. Sesha can’t be more than, what, eighteen? But her skin, it’s like burned leather. And that chemical sme1l..\nDOCTOR: Mmm. A lifetime of scrubbing with carbolic. I wonder — could it be linked to Richter’s Syndrome?\nDOCTOR: 12\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. CLEARING IN ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nTURLOUGH: Those sounds have receded. It must be safe to move on.\nNYSSA: Turlough, what you said about us being watched...\nTURLOUGH: Yes-?\nNYSSA: You weren’t imagining it.\nMERTIL: (FX: BURSTING THROUGH UNDERGROWTH) Hold-!\nNYSSA: It’s alright, we mean you no harm —\nMERTIL: Not you, the man.\nTURLOUGH: M-me?\nMERTIL: Step forward! A cap of red... Then the stories are true. Never thought I’d see with my own eyes.\nTURLOUGH: Perhaps if you put down the club we could talk about this.\nMERTIL: Where is Brother Anulf, red-thatch? Where have you taken him?\nTURLOUGH: I have no idea what you’re talking about!\nNYSSA: Please, we’ve only just arrived here.\nMERTIL: Yes, from the Lands Beyond the River. The Taker — and his acolyte.\nNYSSA: Your face, your hands, they’re bleeding.\nNYSSA: 13\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 14\nMERTIL: My purity shines in beads of blood, girl. The Takers will never come for me. Never.\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO TO NYSSA) Is she suffering from this illness of yours?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) I don’t think so. (TO MERTIL) My name is Nyssa, [and —]\nMERTIL: I don’t want your filthy name. If you’ve already taken Brother Anulf, why do you wait? Who else have you come for? Well?\nNYSSA: Turlough, she’s trying to keep us here. There are others\nNYSSA: coming.\nMERTIL: And we'll kill you! (STRAINS AS SHE SWINGS THE CLUB)\nNYSSA: Turlough, look out!\nNYSSA: Her club’s stuck in the tree. Run, Turlough-!\nTURLOUGH: I’m running! (THEY RUN)\nMERTIL: Come back here, red-thatch!\nMERTIL: (FX: JESTAN’S SEARCH PARTY APPROACHING THROUGH UNDERGROWTH, OFF)\nJESTAN: (OFF, CALLS) Mertil?\nMERTIL: Jestan, at last! Bring your men and the spark wire. Hurry,\nMERTIL: they’re getting away!\nJESTAN: (TO OTHERS) Fan out, men. Follow the Takers!\nJESTAN: 14\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 15\nJESTAN: (APPR MERTIL) Thank Sir John, you were not taken yourself.\nMERTIL: The Taker’s hair was truly red, Jestan. So much of it. And his skin, so pale. Unnatural.\nJESTAN: And Anulf?\nMERTIL: We must follow them, Jestan. And scour the truth from them.\nMERTIL: SCENE 8: EXT. FOREST PATH. NIGHT\nHERVEY: (NERVOUS) S-someone there-?\nSESHA: Hold tight, Hervey.\nHERVEY: (RELIEF) Sesha, it’s you — (CORRECTING SELF) Sister Sesha, I mean. You won’t believe what’s happened. Mertil and me, we found two Takers.\nSESHA: What? Was my father with them?\nHERVEY: I don’t know. Jestan and the others went off after them. I waited for you here.\nSESHA: I must go. I have to see.\nHERVEY: (PULLING HER BACK) Sesha, wait. You’re needed at the Bay.\nSESHA: Why’s that?\nSESHA: 15\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 16\nHERVEY: Garr came, said that with Anulf taken, and you and Mertil both searching, the people need reassurance that Anulf’s closest haven’t been taken too. They’re afraid, Sesha. They need a leader.\nSESHA: Mertil’s right, I only have emergency powers. They need my father.\nHERVEY: Isn’t it better they get you right now, and not Mertil?\nSESHA: I’m glad to hear you say that. I thought when you stayed with her...\nHERVEY: I wanted to go with you. Like I wanted to go with Jestan and the others. (PAUSE) I’m just scared, Sesha.\nSESHA: We all are. I suppose I had better go back. And take my news with me.\nHERVEY: News?\nSESHA: Not now. I must think of the implications. My mind is spinning... (SIGHS) Imagine if we stopped an actual Taker. If we could only find out what they want with us... What they do...\nHERVEY: You should have an escort back to the Bay.\nSESHA: No. I’1ll go alone. But promise me, Hervey, you’1ll bring word of my father. As soon as you get it?\nHERVEY: Soon as. Hold tight, Sesha. Sir John’s hand be steady over you.\nSESHA: And you. Hold tight.\nSESHA: 16\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. CLIFFTOP FROM ALIEN FOREST. NIGHT\nTEGAN: (SIGHS) I’ve got such a headache.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Proximity to those Shades, perhaps. The fluctuations in their speech and volume suggest their presence bleeds over multiple carrier wavelengths...\nTEGAN: That’s not helping the ache, Doctor. (FX: WE HEAR SESHA APPROACH) Here comes Sesha, p’raps you can test out your theories on her.\nDOCTOR: (TO SESHA) Well, here we are, where you left us.\nSESHA: Good. (PAUSE) I’m taking you to the Bay. We’ve never lost our leader to the Takers before, the people need reassurance.\nTEGAN: I’m not surprised. This whole place gives me the creeps. (PAUSE) Don’t you think the sight of us strolling into town might finish your people off?\nSESHA: Your arrival must be properly handled. (PAUSE) I need to know. Doctor, Tegan... are you from the Section?\nDOCTOR: What section?\nSESHA: An expedition left Purity a hundred years ago. They didn’t come back.\nTEGAN: You mean nobody looked for them?\nSESHA: We must always stay close to the Bay. Hold tight — the most important law.\nDOCTOR: Hold tight to what exactly?\nDOCTOR: 17\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 18\nSESHA: To Purity. To the hope that we will be rescued and taken back to the stars. If you’re not from the Section, ‘Doctor’... are you here to rescue us?\nDOCTOR: Well, I — er...\nTEGAN: What the Doctor means is: we’ll help if we can.\nTEGAN: SCENE 10: EXT. RIVERSIDE. NIGHT\nTURLOUGH: (RUN TO STOP) A river! Where to now-?.\nNYSSA: (STOPPED) Sounds like rapids up ahead. We’1l be cut off.\nTURLOUGH: Well, we can’t stay here.\nNYSSA: Perhaps if we tried to talk to them?\nTURLOUGH: We did. They talked back with blunt instruments, remember?\nNYSSA: They’re getting closer.\nNYSSA: NYSSA3: Wait. There are more ahead of us.\nTURLOUGH: A different search party. We’re trapped.\nNYSSA: The river, then. We’ll have to wade across.\nNYSSA: 18\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole\nTURLOUGH: Page 19\nTURLOUGH: But it stinks! And we’ve no idea what creatures might be in\nTURLOUGH: there...\nNYSSA: Where else can we go?\nTURLOUGH: If I must —\nJESTAN: (RUSHING TO RIVERSIDE) There they are, in the water. on the spark wire. Use the sling-stones. Get them!\nNYSSA: Never mind the smell, Turlough, swim for it!\nTURLOUGH: (SWIMMING) What are they throwing?\nNYSSA: (SWIMMING) Anything they can find. Swim faster.\nNYSSA: (TREADING WATER) Turlough? Turlough!\nNYSSA: No\nNYSSA: range\nNYSSA: 19\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: EXT. FOREST PATH. NIGHT\nSESHA: The path leads straight to the Bay.\nDOCTOR: But will we be entering it as your prisoners?\nTEGAN: Sesha?\nSESHA: I don’t believe you are Takers.\nDOCTOR: Who are these ‘Takers’?\nSESHA: They’ve never been seen, not properly. They walk like men, but are more than men - so the stories go. But whenever one of us is made too weak by wounds or illness — he or she is Taken.\nTEGAN: Bodysnatchers?\nDOCTOR: Impatient ones, it seems.\nTEGAN: Sounds like they really do need more doctors here.\nSESHA: Anyone who’s taken is never seen or heard of again.\nDOCTOR: Without exception?\nSESHA: (CLOSE TO TEARS) Without exception. I — I was so angry with Father for marrying Mertil so soon... so soon after... (SWALLOWS BACK THE HURT) Forgive me.\nTEGAN: It’s alright. Better out than in.\nDOCTOR: How long has this been going on?\nDOCTOR: 20\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 21\nSESHA: For always. Or as long as anyone can remember. Like the Shades. (FX: SHADE CHITTER) But they don’t do anything. The elders say they’re the remains of everyone who was ever Taken... their unclean souls barred from heaven.\nDOCTOR: So your Elders don’t really know any more than us.\nSESHA: You don’t believe them?\nDOCTOR: Do you?\nSESHA: Wounds become dirty. Sickness brings death. And cleanliness is next to godliness.\nTEGAN: What happened to your father?\nSESHA: Sickness in his chest.\nTEGAN: His heart? Then you must’ve know the Takers would come for him.\nSESHA: We left guards on watch at his bedside. Prepared alarms. It made no difference. The Takers made them sleep and took him.\nDOCTOR: Despite the floodlighting. I assume that’s our destination ahead?\nSESHA: Yes. That is Purity Bay. Somehow, I’ve got to be its leader. So\nSESHA: suddenly it matters, doesn’t it?\nTEGAN: What you believe in, you mean?\nSESHA: Yes. But what do I believe in?\nSESHA: 21\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. RIVERSIDE. NIGHT\nJESTAN: Mertil!\nMERTIL: Well, Jestan?\nJESTAN: Couldn’t get close enough for the spark-wire. They went into the water — and it didn’t kill them!\nMERTIL: Unnatural, evil creatures.\nJESTAN: We hit the Taker square on his red head. The girl screamed and then the current swept them away from us. They must be dead... Gone the same way as Sesha’s mother.\nMERTIL: These creatures are different from us, they thrive on filth and corruption. If they live, there may be... reprisals.\nJESTAN: What should we do?\nMERTIL: I will return to Purity, to give my husband’s people comfort at this difficult time. (BEAT) My late husband’‘s people...\nMERTIL: Ze\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: EXT. PURITY BAY. NIGHT\nSESHA: Tegan, Doctor — we’re not far from the boundary now. It’s guarded. You’d better wait here.\nDOCTOR: Keeping us your little secret?\nSESHA: I don’t want people glimpsing you and rumours spreading. I want to announce you properly. To reassure people you’re here to rescue us.\nDOCTOR: We don’t have magic wands to wave, Sesha. If we’re to help you we need to know where your people came from, what they’re doing...\nTEGAN: What’s that building there? Looks sort of... pre-fabricated.\nSESHA: It is the rest centre. The exercise centre is beside it. Rest and exercise are vital to health.\nDOCTOR: Well, quite.\nSESHA: Then there is Deacon Chamber.\nTEGAN: Who’s he when he’s at home?\nDOCTOR: I think Sesha means that big metal box? Part oven, part washing machine? A decontamination chamber!\nSESHA: When I take the guards away, go into the Rest Centre and wait. There are only my father’s guards in there - the ones the Takers made sleep. The passcode is 7-4-3-9-7.\nTEGAN: You're giving us our own way in?\nSESHA: My father trusted his first instincts. Mine are to trust you. I’1l come for you as soon as I can. (SESHA LEAVES)\nSESHA: 23\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 24\nTEGAN: When she said Purity. I wasn’t expecting a trailer park. And\nTEGAN: that disinfectant smell...\nDOCTOR: Look at those guards Sesha’s leading away.\nTEGAN: Their skin... Burnt raw, just the same as hers’.\nDOCTOR: I’d imagine everyone here’s the same.\nTEGAN: And their clothes...\nDOCTOR: Standard issue coveralls for extended space travel.\nTEGAN: I meant, starched stiff?\nDOCTOR: That’1l be too many turns through Sesha’s ‘deacon chamber’.\nDOCTOR: daresay the original meaning’s been lost over the years...\nTEGAN: Well, Sesha’s as good as her word. The way’s clear...\nDOCTOR: I only wish Nyssa and Turlough were safe here, too.\nTEGAN: Safe-?!?\nDOCTOR: Relatively speaking. Come on. Keep low.\nDOCTOR: I\nDOCTOR: 24\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. RIVERSIDE/STERILE FOREST ZONE. DAWN\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE. NO SHADES. JUST QUIETER NIGHT NOISES, AND THE RIVER, RUSHING ALONG. )\nDOCTOR WHO: (NYSSA’S MADE IT TO THE RIVER BANK, SHE COUGHS, SHIVERY, SOAKED AND COLD. TURLOUGH’S BESIDE HER, HE’S BEEN UNCONSCIOUS IN THE\nWATER: )\nNYSSA: Turlough? Can you hear me?\nNYSSA: They hit you on the head. A stone, I think.\nTURLOUGH: Feels more like a boulder.\nNYSSA: I tried to keep your head out of the water but couldn’t fight the current.\nTURLOUGH: Probably as well, took us out of their reach.\nNYSSA: But further away from the Doctor and Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Why did those two have to charge off at the first sniff of trouble?\nNYSSA: It’s my fault as well, you waited for me when the Shades... (BREAKS OFF) Listen.\nTURLOUGH: What is it?\nNYSSA: The Shades, they’ve gone. There aren’t any.\nTURLOUGH: Not a whisper... And the air... smells fresher, cleaner. (CHOKES) I thought the water was polluted?\nNYSSA: It is, it stinks of carbolic.\nTURLOUGH: It did stink of chemicals. (SMACKS LIPS) This stuff tastes pure as a mountain spring.\nTURLOUGH: 25\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 26\nNYSSA: (WARY) Where are we, I wonder?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know. But it’s getting lighter. Maybe this place improves with daylight?\nNYSSA: Come on, we’d better find a way back to the TARDIS — and hope we don’t run into anyone else on the way...\nNYSSA: SCENE 15: INT. MEDICAL CENTRE. DAWN\nDOCTOR: Here we are. Rest Centre. (DOOR CLOSES) No Shades in here.\nTEGAN: Not much of anything in here. Just beds and showers.\nDOCTOR: A little more powerful than that, they’re steam-soakers. Some of this equipment on the far wall is rather more interesting.\nTEGAN: In your opinion.\nDOCTOR: An old virtual reality generator. (FX: FLICKS SWITCHES) No power... (BANGS ON THE MACHINE)\nTEGAN: Not so loud! You’1l wake Anulf’s guards. (WALKS OVER) They’re both still well under.\nDOCTOR: And a sleep-inducer! Promotes restful sleep. Or did once. (STUDIES IT) Scarring on the front panel, suggestive of a high- intensity energy blast... Aha! Similar markings on the VR unit. But why have a device that stimulates the brain right beside one that calms it — hmm?\nTEGAN: Maybe they were moved in here later.\nDOCTOR: I wonder — did the Takers use the sleep inducer to knock out the guards?\nTEGAN: I don’t think so. Look here at their wrists.\nTEGAN: 26\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 27\nDOCTOR: Injector marks. Shallow breathing, pupils dilated. They’ve been drugged. A sedative of some kind.\nTEGAN: But we heard Anulf shout out. Why wasn’t he sedated?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps these two took his share of the dose. (FX: SOUND OF\nENTRY: CODER AND DOORS OPENING) Down!\nMERTIL: Hold tight, Jestan. You and your group have earned your rest.\nJESTAN: The other parties will return soon. Better steam-soak while it’s quiet, Antan...\nANTAN: Jestan! Behind the bunks —\nDOCTOR: There’s really no need to be afraid.\nANTAN: More Takers?\nMERTIL: So - retaliation is swift.\nDOCTOR: Retaliation? There must be some confusion - Sister Sesha let us in here.\nMERTIL: Not even Sesha would be so suicidally stupid.\nDOCTOR: She wants to present us to everyone at once precisely to avoid this reaction in smaller groups.\nJESTAN: Look at them.\nTEGAN: Not all this again.\nMERTIL: Don’t be afraid, Jestan. The Taker and his acolyte ran from us in the forest. They fear our purity.\nMERTIL: 27\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 28\nDOCTOR: Why not find Sesha, she’1ll vouch for us.\nTEGAN: We only want to help.\nMERTIL: Yes, to help poison that girl’s weak mind further! Jestan, use\nMERTIL: the spark-wire.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Now you might not know it, but that’s a kardax defibrillator, designed to cause the return of spontaneous circulation by remotely applying an electric shock to the heart.\nMERTIL: Hear him babble in his fear!\nDOCTOR: You haven’t centred the ranging locator. Without a focus —\nTEGAN: Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Tegan! That really was extraordinarily painful —\nMERTIL: Again, Jestan.\nTEGAN: Stop it! You’1ll kill him!\nMERTIL: Do it again, Jestan! Again! Again! Again!!!\nMERTIL: END OF PART ONE\nMERTIL: 28\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 29"

Here comes the spin cycle.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m sure this won’t take long.\nTEGAN: Those marks on the floor. They’re like the ones on those\nTEGAN: machines in the rest centre.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. The disruption pattern looks identical. Which means the same explosion of energy affected all three units.\nTEGAN: I didn’t see marks like that on the outside.\nDOCTOR: No. The blast must have affected external and internal\nDOCTOR: structures simultaneously. Intra-dimensional. But what on this\nDOCTOR: planet could cause that?\nDOCTOR: 42\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: EXT. OUTSIDE REST CENTRE. DAY\nSESHA: (ADDRESSING CROWD) A man and a woman are in the deacon chamber now. (SWELL OF FEARFUL MURMURS) I did not want to risk them bringing infection to Purity. And I did not wish to discuss with you until after I had interrogated them thoroughly. But they are not Takers. If they were, they would have come in secret, as always. No, they are strangers - like us, from the stars. (MORE CROWD MURMURS) This could be the most important day of all our lives!\nJESTAN: Or it could be the last.\nANTAN: How did they hurt you, Hervey?\nHERVEY: I — I was tired, I fell.\nMERTIL: You were overcome, boy. The strangers caused it.\nSESHA: (DESPERATE NOW) One is a doctor! (FX: CROWD REACTION) He brings meaning to the old words of power.\nMERTIL: (TO THE CROWD) You call this callow girl Sister. But the strangers know her naivete, her laxity. They call her ‘fool’.\nSESHA: Be quiet, Mertil.\nMERTIL: I speak for Purity!\nSESHA: (SHOUTS) I am the daughter of Brother Anulf! His cries of kidnap are barely gone from the air before you seek to rule in his place. Is that the reason you loved him so dearly, stepmother? Yes, and so swiftly?\nHERVEY: The deacon chamber. It just slipped two cycles.\nMERTIL: Impurities must be driven out.\nSESHA: What-?!?\nSESHA: 43\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: INT: DEACON CHAMBER. DAY\nTEGAN: Is this steam or smoke?\nDOCTOR: Neither. A chemical mist.\nTEGAN: That bleach smell’s getting worse.\nDOCTOR: Reaching poisonous levels. (BANGS ON WALL) Sesha! Let us out! (PAUSE) No good. They can’t hear us.\nTEGAN: Or they don’t want to. This is deliberate. They’re going to kill us!\nTEGAN: SCENE 26: EXT. OUTSIDE DEACON CHAMBER. DAY.\nSESHA: Mertil, reset the deacon chamber controls.\nMERTIL: Their hygiene levels are low. They are in need of extra decon!\nSESHA: The strangers are not soiled dressings to be made fresh. You will kill them. Do you want to throw away all hope of rescue?\nMERTIL: We have survived by obeying doctors’ orders, Sir John’s litanies of hygiene, by keeping ourselves pure in soul and body.\nSESHA: And holding tight till rescue comes.\nMERTIL: There is no rescue coming, girl! Anulf’s words, he told me so.\nSESHA: He did not tell the rest of Purity, and neither did you. (QUOTING HER) Do leaders keep secrets from their people?\nSESHA: Now reset the controls before the cleansing becomes an execution!\nSESHA: 44\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT: DEACON CHAMBER. DAY\nTEGAN: (COUGHING) Doctor, I can’t — can’t...\nDOCTOR: They’re powering down. Seems someone’s had second thoughts...\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Tegan? Tegan!\nSESHA: (CALLING IN) Doctor, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: Tegan’s collapsed. We must get her into the rest centre. Quickly!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: INT. TAKERS’ CAVE COMPLEX. DAY\nTURLOUGH: Where can we run to? The Takers can appear wherever they like, we can’t keep pushing past them. And when they see I’m lighting\nTURLOUGH: our way with the cadaver of one of their kind...\nNYSSA: Oh, no...\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: Do not run. You must be disposed of. As permitted under active\nTAKER: combat regulation two-zero-one.\nTURLOUGH: (BLUSTERS) Just try it! We’re armed. (SHAKES TAKER HUSK) Look\nTURLOUGH: what we did to your friend here — took him apart!\nTAKER: #2: Conferring —\nNYSSA: Well done, Turlough!\nNYSSA: 45\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 46\nTURLOUGH: It won’t take him long to realise I lied. (PAUSE) That prickling feeling again. On the back of my neck.\nNYSSA: It happened round here before.\nTURLOUGH: Here. Hold our friend, while I check the walls.\nTURLOUGH: NYSSA3: Wait! I feel it now.\nTURLOUGH: And now I don’t.\nNYSSA: The energy’s coming from the Taker.\nTURLOUGH: It’s responding to something. (HE TAPS THE WALLS) The walls feel solid enough.\nNYSSA: Solid, yes. But not like rock. Feel it. (FX: AS NYSSA TOUCHES IT, QUIET HIGH-PITCHED BUZZ) A force-field! (EFFORT) If I just push — (SHE STUMBLES THROUGH) Turlough, I’m through!\nTURLOUGH: The Taker. The barrier’s deactivated because you’re holding it.\nNYSSA: Take my other hand. Come on —\nTURLOUGH: All that and it’s just another tunnel. (BEAT) Or is it...\nNYSSA: Something’s happening. It’s the Taker, it’s transporting\nNYSSA: itself!\nTURLOUGH: But it’s dead! It’s only half there!\nNYSSA: Hold on to me! Turlough — !!!\nNYSSA: 46\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: EXT. OUTSIDE REST CENTRE. DAY.\nDOCTOR: Coming through...\nSESHA: Hervey, the rest centre door.\nHERVEY: Yes. Right. (GOES TO OBEY)\nMAN: I don’t believe it!\nWOMAN: Their skin! Look at their skin!\nSESHA: (TO CROWD) There is no cause for alarm. The strangers are clean now.\nMAN: Just the sight of them...\nSESHA: Hervey, get that door open!\nSESHA: Into the rest centre, Doctor. (TO CROWD) I shall supervise the Doctor and Tegan personally until the meeting at eighteen- hundred hours. In the meantime, the rest centre is out of bounds. Fresh scour-creams will be provided in Section D’s shower block.\nHERVEY: (QUICKLY) I’1l help you guard them, Sister Sesha.\nWOMAN: (TO SELF) Rescue. Imagine...\nWOMAN: 47\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 48\nMERTIL: Truth, Jestan. These people wouldn’t know truth if you scrubbed their eyes with it. Laxity like this will ruin Purity.\nJESTAN: Sesha’s started to win the people round. She spoke well.\nMERTIL: Why must the young seek always to discard the past? She has her father’s tongue, and the fire that used to burn in him. (FX: SCOOSH OF SOAP AS SHE SCRUBS HERSELF) I did so much to reach Anulf’s side. But I could never stir up those old passions.\nJESTAN: There was fire between us once, Mertil.\nMERTIL: A new widow’s fire sleeps, Jestan, till it is more seemly. But I have your support in seeking rule?\nJESTAN: Of course. Should those of our years seek to discard the past too?\nJESTAN: (THE SOUND OF HER SCOURING HER SKIN FADES UP LOUD BENEATH LAST\nSPEECH: )\nMERTIL: Those of our ambition should not. We must deal with my stepdaughter and the strangers.\nJESTAN: Do you truly believe they are linked to the Takers?\nMERTIL: No. I believe they are travellers, just as they say. But they are dangerous. Their words and deeds are a pollution that must be driven from Purity — if not by machine, then by our own pristine hands.\nMERTIL: 48\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. REST CENTRE. DAY.\nTEGAN: (COMING ROUND) Wow. I feel like I’ve been tumble-dried.\nDOCTOR: Just — lie still, Tegan. If you would.\nSESHA: (TO TEGAN) I’m so sorry for what happened.\nTEGAN: You’re in charge, Sesha. Can’t you have that Mertil locked up?\nSESHA: She has too much influence. Until yesterday she was Wife to Brother Anulf — and I was his unruly daughter.\nHERVEY: You can beat her, though, Sesha. You were amazing out there. The people like you.\nSESHA: Oh, Hervey. They don’t like change. Mertil spoke and acted for many.\nHERVEY: And she tried to use me. (SIGHS) I made such a fool of myself today.\nSESHA: On a day of rescue? No-one will remember.\nTEGAN: Doctor, will you stop pacing?\nDOCTOR: You know, this equipment shows signs of being dismantled and put back together again. (BEAT) I can see portions of the original spaceship have been incorporated into Purity’s infrastructure. But this rest centre seems bolted on later, and it lacks a lot of standard equipment.\nSESHA: Everything that could be salvaged was done so. A hundred years ago.\nHERVEY: The rest is in the ghost place.\nTEGAN: The where?\nTEGAN: 49\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 50\nSESHA: It’s always been called that. The ruins of the Section. Away the forest to the south.\nDOCTOR: Could I see it?\nHERVEY: It’s a long hike. Only the Shades go there. It’s just dirty, rusting junk.\nDOCTOR: I might be able to learn something from it. Something important.\nSESHA: I can’t take you, I’m needed here.\nTEGAN: Just point us in the right direction, we’ll find it.\nDOCTOR: No, Tegan, you must stay here.\nTEGAN: I’m fine now, really!\nSESHA: No, Tegan. If both you and the Doctor go...\nDOCTOR: It’ll seem like we’re walking all over you, yes.\nTEGAN: All right.\nSESHA: But you must be guarded, Doctor. Hervey, will you guide the Doctor, and be back in good time for tonight’s meeting?\nHERVEY: Me?\nSESHA: I need someone I can trust. Take Jestan with you. I’d rather and Mertil were kept apart.\nSESHA: in\nSESHA: he\nSESHA: 50\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: EXT. ALIEN FOREST. DAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: OVER FOREST AMBIENCE AND SHADES THE SLUGGISH BLUR OF NOISE\nHERALDS: TURLOUGH AND NYSSA’S ARRIVAL)\nTURLOUGH: Ugh. I’m alive. In one piece. Nyssa...?\nNYSSA: I made it too. We’re back, Turlough. Back across the river.\nTURLOUGH: So this is how the Takers can keep taking. Fully functional, they’d be able to teleport right into the heart of the settlement.\nNYSSA: What do you think triggered it? We’d only just entered the tunnel...\nTURLOUGH: Maybe it was some property of the tunnel itself. Why hide the entrance behind a force-field?\nNYSSA: That feeling at the back of my neck... The other end of the tunnel’s close by.\nTURLOUGH: There. That boulder’s not real, it’s a projection concealing the entrance behind another barrier.\nNYSSA: But why do the Takers need the tunnel if they can transport themselves and others at will?\nTURLOUGH: Let’s just find that settlement and get the Doctor and Tegan out so we can all get back to the TARDIS...\nNYSSA: And hope the Takers can’t track us out here.\nTURLOUGH: We'll try this way. Come on!\nTURLOUGH: 51\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. REST CENTRE. DAY.\nSESHA: Are you feeling better, Tegan?\nTEGAN: Huh? Oh. I fell asleep. (STRETCHES) Weirdest dreams.\nSESHA: This day feels like a dream. So unreal.\nTEGAN: I wonder how the Doctor and Hervey are getting on.\nSESHA: They must be nearing the Ghost Place now.\nTEGAN: Jestan went with them?\nSESHA: Once he’d asked Mertil’s permission.\nTEGAN: Really?\nSESHA: I don’t know. They had a huddled meeting about something.\nTEGAN: Sounds like you were right to separate them. (SITS UP) What’s\nTEGAN: the mood in Purity?\nSESHA: Some are afraid. Some feel... anticipation. I wish... so much... that\nSESHA: things could change.\nTEGAN: One thing you can be sure of, Sesha — things change around the\nTEGAN: Doctor.\nTEGAN: 52\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: EXT. GHOST PLACE. DAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: NO WILDLIFE AMBIENCE, ONLY MORE SHADES THAN WE’VE BEEN\nUSED: TO, AND THE WIND)\nHERVEY: (WALKING TO HALT) Here we are then, Doctor. The Section.\nJESTAN: The Ghost Place.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. The remains of another prefabricated building, but this one built well away from the main camp. (BEAT) Quarantine, perhaps?\nJESTAN: What’s so interesting? It’s just a heap of dirty metal. Corroded. Corrupted! Even the native fauna leaves it alone.\nDOCTOR: But the Shades like it here.\nHERVEY: The Elders say the way to the next life is hidden here, and that the Shades search for it forever, in vain.\nJESTAN: The unclean shall always be barred from true purity. It’s a place that tricks the eyes. You see movement where there is no movement.\nDOCTOR: As though the Shades were crossing over into a visual wavelength. But why here? That’s what’s interesting, Jestan. That — and those markings...\nHERVEY: Like something hit the side of the Section. (REALISES) I’ve seen that pattern before.\nDOCTOR: Back in the Rest Centre, yes. The VR unit and the Sleep-Aider bear the same scars; they were obviously looted from this part of the wreck. A massive outrush of energy took place here, disrupting and displacing cellular matter at an intra- dimensional level.\nJESTAN: What are you babbling about?\nJESTAN: 53\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 54\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to babble. I wasn’t actually referring to those markings at all - but to the green crescent you can see there on the side of the ship. Ring any bells? Nothing in Sir John’s litany? Or the surgeon’s litany, I should say — ‘Sir John’ is a simple verbal corruption over the years, the real meaning long since lost.\nHERVEY: I don’t understand?\nDOCTOR: The green crescent is the universal symbol for a hospital. Purity is built around a vast medical ship. I imagine your people are all descended from the original patients.\nHERVEY: Our ancestors...?\nHERVEY: 54\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: EXT. PATH OVERLOOKING PURITY BAY. DAY\nNYSSA: 3: So that’s the settlement.\nTURLOUGH: A fading huddle of emergency shelters... Bits of junk hauled out from a downed spaceship... These people might as well have put up a sign for the Takers — attack us please, we’re helpless.\nNYSSA: That’s just it, they are helpless. In need of rescue. (SHADES\nFLIT: ABOUT NYSSA) The Shades are back.\nTURLOUGH: I can almost feel them. Like bats flapping past in the dark...\nTURLOUGH: NYSSA3: ‘Clean... soon’.\nTURLOUGH: I’m sorry?\nNYSSA: ‘Forever...’\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, are you alright-?\nNYSSA: Can’t you hear them whisper? Something terrible happened here on Chodor.\nTURLOUGH: It happened to me, last night. I know we need to rescue the Doctor and Tegan, but I’m in no hurry to be mobbed again just for the colour of my hair. (PAUSE) Perhaps we should use their fear of the Takers against them. That trick I used on the Taker in the cave might work even better on the people down there...\nNYSSA: It might. Come on, we'd better go.\nNYSSA: (TURLOUGH AND NYSSA MOVE OFF. THE SHADES SEEM TO GATHER WHERE THEY STOOD, GETTING CLOSER IN SPEAKERS )\nNYSSA: 55\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. REST CENTRE. DAY\nTEGAN: It’s getting dark. I hate waiting around.\nSESHA: Here in Purity that’s all we ever do, day after day after day.\nTEGAN: How d’you pass the time?\nSESHA: We learn the books in the library off by heart... We hold tight. And we do occupational therapy — make things, write and draw, take turns to prepare food.\nTEGAN: At least you know your hands are clean. (BEAT) Why do you do it? Always washing the whole time.\nSESHA: Water and soap kill germs. Sir John’s litany says so — the harder you scrub, the more you kill.\nTEGAN: But look what it’s done to you. Your hands... your poor face.\nSESHA: The thicker the skin, the stronger the faith. (PAUSE) You don’t believe in any of this, do you, Tegan?\nTEGAN: You’re strong, Sesha. Have faith in yourself.\nSESHA: I don’t feel very strong. First I lost my mother. And now, without my father... (BEAT) You know, Purity’s leader has special armour. My father never wore it. He felt strong enough without it.\nTEGAN: You don’t need armour. You’re coping. You’1l go on coping, with friends like Hervey around you, till you know what it is you really need.\nSESHA: Thank you, Tegan —\nANTAN: Sister Sesha. Come quickly!\nANTAN: 56\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 57\nSESHA: I must go.\nTEGAN: A leader’s work’s never done.\nMERTIL: Ah, Sesha.\nSESHA: Mertil? What is the meaning of [this-?]\nMERTIL: Antan, watch the stranger.\nTEGAN: Found yourself another puppy, have you?\nANTAN: Be quiet, woman —\nTEGAN: Stay away from me!\nSESHA: Mertil! Explain yourself!\nMERTIL: You really shouldn’t hide from your people, Sesha. Alone with the stranger, anything might happen. (BEAT) Anything at all.\nSESHA: What-?\nMERTIL: Antan — the blade, if you will.\nANTAN: My lady — (PASSES HER SCALPEL)\nTEGAN: A scalpel-?\nMERTIL: Sir John’s blade, woman. And may Sir John’s hand be on mine.\nSESHA: What are you doing? Mertil, Mertil, no-!!!\nSESHA: 57\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. GHOST PLACE. DAY\nJESTAN: You say we are descended from the sick?\nDOCTOR: The sick, the injured, the wounded, the traumatised. That’s where you find a mind-stimulator next to a sleep-aider! Ina hospital ward where different residents have different needs.\nHERVEY: I.. this is incredible... Doctor, where was the ship going?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. But Mertil was right — the rescue you hoped for can’t be coming, not after so long. The Takers are exploiting the situation, and as for the Shades... I don’t know. I just don’t know. I’m missing something...\nHERVEY: Sesha needs to hear this. Come on, Jestan. We must get back to Purity.\nJESTAN: Sorry, boy. I’ve heard enough. You’re staying here with the Shades. (GRABS HERVEY)\nHERVEY: J-Jestan, please. You’re hurting me —\nDOCTOR: Let him go, Jestan!\nJESTAN: . to find your way to the next life.\nJESTAN: (FX: HERVEY’S NECK BREAKS. HE SLUMPS HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. THE\nSHADES: FLUTTER)\nDOCTOR: (CROUCHES TO EXAMINE HIM) His neck’s broken. (RISES) With all the twisted lengths you go to in order to preserve life in Purity, you killed him in a moment. Why?\nJESTAN: Me? No. You killed him, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: What-?\nJESTAN: . and when I show the people of Purity Hervey’s poor, broken body, they won’t just want an eye for an eye — they’1l want to flay the flesh from your bones.\nJESTAN: END OF PART TWO\nJESTAN: 58\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 59"

If we are to stand against their corruption we must be spotless-clean!\nTURLOUGH: Sounds like they have a dirt fixation.\nNYSSA: The Doctor and Tegan would never have hurt anyone.\nTURLOUGH: Whatever the circumstances, that woman’s stirring up a lynch mob.\nTURLOUGH: 63\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA3: The Shades don’t like it either.\nTURLOUGH: So. What are we going to do?\nMERTIL: We stand clean and in virtue. Now let us kill the spike-haired girl. Let us open her dirt-packed veins and take from her as her Taker friends have taken from us!\nNYSSA: (SHOUTED FROM OFF) No! You’re making a terrible mistake.\nMERTIL: You... here!\nNYSSA: (CALLIN OUT) This woman thought that I was an acolyte to these Takers, but it’s not true. I am a traveller, and so are my friends.\nMERTIL: Don’t believe her! Look at her - soft white skin, hair like muddied brambles. She is a thing of corruption and indolence, to be stamped out.\nNYSSA: If I served the Takers would I bring you — this?\nNYSSA: (FX: REACHES INTO THICKET AND PULLS OUT TAKER. BIG CROWD REACTION)\nCROWD MEMBERS: It’s one of them! A Taker!\nWOMAN: If she can do that to a Taker, what could she do to us?\nNYSSA: I escaped from the Takers and came here, to show you we mean no harm to any of you!\nNYSSA: 64\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: INT.

I will not sleep. I will — (DROWSY) not... s[leep —]\nMERTIL: No harm? This is a trick. Sister Sesha lies dying, at the hands of the spike-haired girl. And where is the Doctor? Who knows what he has done to Jestan and Hervey?\nNYSSA: I am not tricking you.\nTEGAN: (WOOZY) Nyssa...?\nNYSSA: I know my friends, they would never knowingly harm anyone.\nMERTIL: Never knowingly — yes, like the mud never knowingly oozes into the wound, as dirt never knowingly affects the heart!\nTEGAN: What...? Who are you?\nTAKER: #1: You are sick. You must be taken.\nTEGAN: Leave me alone.\nTAKER: #2: We have come to take you.\nTEGAN: Please, get back! I’m not like the others... No!!!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Tegan...? (BEAT; TO SELF) Funny, I could have sworn I heard her voice.\nDOCTOR: 65\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44: EXT. PURITY CLEARING. DUSK\nMERTIL: Disregard the whisperers! We will fetch the spike-haired girl. We will hear the filth fall from her mouth...\nWOMAN: Look there! At the forest edge. Takers!\nNYSSA: They’ve got Tegan!\nMERTIL: A trick! (ROUNDS ON NYSSA) You distracted us so the Takers could help your friend escape our justice.\nNYSSA: When will you listen? If I was in league with the Takers, they would have taken me with them.\nMERTIL: They left you here to spread more contagion, more corruption. Antan — kill her now. Carve the dirt out of her. Kill her!\nMERTIL: NYSSA3: No!\nTURLOUGH: (OFF) Leave the stranger!\nMAN: What was that?\nTURLOUGH: (OFF) Your actions have displeased the Shades. Stay away from her or we shall destroy you all!\nMERTIL: Don’t be afraid. It’s another trick! Don’t let the girl go — Come back. We must... (SHE’S GROWING TIRED) ... must be strong...\nANTAN: (DROWSY) Mertil? I — I can’t keep my eyes open...\nANTAN: 66\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole\nMERTIL: (DROWSY) What? ..

TAKERS’ CAVE. NIGHT\nTEGAN: (SHOCK) Where are we now?\nTAKER: #1: The Shades did not follow?\nTAKER: #2: The Sterility wall still stands at full integrity.\nTEGAN: Let me go. I’m not even a part of Purity. I’m not even sick! What about Sesha? She’s hurt, you can’t take me and not her...\nTAKER: #1: Take the subject for processing.\nTEGAN: Not your disappearing trick again...\nTEGAN: SCENE 46: INT. REST CENTRE. DUSK\nDOCTOR: Won’t be a moment. I need to maintain the booster circuit in this sleep inducer so Mertil’s lynch mob won’t wake up too soon.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: So that’s how —\nDOCTOR: Exactly. We’re safe in here, in the eye of the hurricane, so to speak —\nTURLOUGH: Yes, but — where did you spring from, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Ghost Place — where a section of hospital-ship rusts quietly in the afterglow of some very strange energies. I took advantage of your excellent distraction to slip inside and put the people to sleep.\nDOCTOR: 68\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 69\nNYSSA: Doctor. The Takers have taken Tegan.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought as much.\nTURLOUGH: I just hope she isn’t badly hurt.\nDOCTOR: Quite. I found Sister Sesha dumped under a sheet, in the side room. Nyssa, could you check on her, please?\nNYSSA: Of course. (EXITS)\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, I think we know where Tegan’s been taken.\nDOCTOR: You do? (BEAT) Yes. Good. Because we can’t stay here. The sleep inducer won’t last, it wasn’t designed for sustained wide broadcast — (ANOTHER THOUGHT) Why?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know, I’m not a technician!\nDOCTOR: No, I mean, why didn’t the Takers take Sesha when they took Tegan?\nNYSSA: Here’s your answer. Body armour beneath her coveralls. The actual wound isn’t so serious.\nDOCTOR: Body armour? On a hospital ship?\nTURLOUGH: There goes your sleep inducer.\nDOCTOR: We must go. We’ve got to get Tegan back from the Takers. We’1ll take Sesha with us. Turlough, you can lead the way. Come on, there’s not a moment to waste!\nDOCTOR: 69\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. TAKERS’ CAVE (PROCESSING AREA). NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. STEADY POWER HUM, GENTLE BLEEPS — IT’S A MEDICAL\nWARD: )\nTEGAN: Where am I?\nTAKER: In the Recovery Area.\nTEGAN: Thanks, I’m so much the wiser.\nTAKER: You are in the recovery area of Segregated Community Zone Chodor-one-alpha.\nTEGAN: Felt so strange... like I was looking down at myself. What did you do to me?\nTAKER: No medical treatment was prescribed.\nTEGAN: Medical treatment?\nTAKER: You were processed in error. You are a space traveller outside our authority. You do not belong in the settlement.\nTEGAN: I told you that much, before you zapped me off here.\nTAKER: Interference in monitor systems resulted in your being taken in error.\nTEGAN: Not been paying your electric bill?\nTAKER: Power supply is at a premium. You are not eligible for treatment. You are not eligible for compensation. You will remain in Segregated community zone Chodor-one-alpha.\nTEGAN: I don’t want to stay here. I have to find my friends.\nTEGAN: 70\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 71\nTAKER: You are not eligible to find your friends. Changes in your medical condition may lead to reassessment of treatment rights. Attempts to leave will result in termination. This is your only warning.\nTEGAN: You mean I have to stay here forever?\nANULF: (FROM OFF) If you want to live. We all must, all who’ve been taken — even a traveller from the stars.\nTEGAN: Who are you?\nANULF: (APPROACHING) In Purity... I was Brother Anulf.\nANULF: SCENE 48: EXT: CHODOR FOREST. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING, CARRYING TAKER HUSK) Turlough, Nyssa, are you sure this is the way?\nNYSSA: I hope so. We’re looking for the entrance to a kind of service tunnel. But the forest looks very different by night.\nTURLOUGH: (WEIGHED DOWN) Can we rest? Carrying this woman uphill is killing me...\nDOCTOR: I admit, this half-Taker of yours isn’t the lightest of objects. (SETS TAKER DOWN) All right. Just for a moment. Set her down here on the grass.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Mind Sesha’s head-!\nDOCTOR: I’m certain those Shades are following us. What do they want?\nNYSSA: They’re telepathic on some level, I think.\nNYSSA: 71\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 72\nTURLOUGH: What, they’re trying to communicate?\nDOCTOR: If only we could ask them for directions.\nTURLOUGH: I’m afraid we weren’t checking for landmarks when we were running for our lives from the Takers’ lair, on our way to rescue you.\nNYSSA: It’s all right. He’s only worried about Tegan.\nDOCTOR: And the future of this community. Between the Takers and Mertil’s machinations it doesn’t look promising.\nNYSSA: Sesha’s coming round.\nDOCTOR: We’d better check that dressing you made for her has staunched\nDOCTOR: the bleeding. Bring your Taker’s head-light a little closer,\nDOCTOR: would you. (PAUSE) Luminous. Why luminous?\nSESHA: (GROANS AGAIN) Mertil, NO!\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Sesha. Hold still.\nSESHA: Doctor? Mertil and Antan attacked us. Tegan and I.\nDOCTOR: Was Tegan hurt?\nSESHA: She was struggling. I didn’t see — Ow.\nNYSSA: Luckily your body armour prevented the blade from going too\nNYSSA: deep.\nSESHA: Father’s armour. To make me strong. (PAUSE) Who are you?\nSESHA: 72\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 73\nDOCTOR: These are the two friends I told you about, Turlough and Nyssa.\nSESHA: Where’s Hervey? Why isn’t he with you? Is he all right...?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Sesha. Jestan killed him. He wanted your people to believe I was responsible. A martyr for Mertil’s cause.\nSESHA: Dead... because of her. She’s deranged, Doctor. She killed my mother, she told me — just to clear a path to my father. She’s so desperate for influence, to make everyone as extreme as she is%\nDOCTOR: After the way things have turned out — and in the absence of other candidates - I’m afraid influence is almost certainly what she’s got. And she’1ll mean to use it.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 49: EXT. PURITY CLEARING. DUSK\nJESTAN: Mertil? Mertil, wake up! What has happened here? The Rest Centre’s full of smoke.\nMERTIL: Jestan? Something made me sleep...\nJESTAN: Made all of you sleep. On the ground?\nMERTIL: The Doctor. (FX: SCOOSH OF SOAP, SCRUBBING) He was here. In the confusion, he put everyone to sleep with that rest centre machine... How did he escape you?\nJESTAN: The Shades helped him in the place of ghosts. They attacked me.\nMERTIL: The Shades can hurt no-one. (SEETHING) I don’t understand how\nMERTIL: the Takers left Sesha, but took the spike-haired girl. Is she\nMERTIL: really in league with them, her and her friends? And have they really taken my daughter?\nMERTIL: ES\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 74\nJESTAN: I don’t know... I did as you said with Hervey.\nMERTIL: Ahhh. Perhaps the boy can still be of use.\nJESTAN: Your plans still stand?\nMERTIL: While Sesha lives I will never know rightful power. And while the Takers take I will never know security. Only by uniting all Purity will we have strength to vanquish their evil. Uniting them by any means. Yes, Jestan, my plans still stand.\nJESTAN: The people are waking now.\nMERTIL: And no one will have realised what happened. So the truth is ours to twist. (CALLING) Rouse yourselves from the filthy ground. The Strangers have killed young Hervey!\nJESTAN: I was lucky to survive myself.\nMERTIL: Remember, the boy fell at the Doctor’s look before. A second look struck him dead. Now we too have fallen and a second could kill any one of us.\nWOMAN: We must hide!\nMERTIL: No. We must follow him, and kill him. All of us together, with night-lanterns — so he cannot look at any one of us. Scour your skin, people of Purity. We are right and we are strong. Scrub harder. Harder!\nMERTIL: 74\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: EXT: CHODOR FOREST. NIGHT.\nNYSSA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Yes, Nyssa, I know. It’s time to go. Sesha - I know you’ve been through so much, and you don’t have to come with us, of course. But we must find Tegan.\nSESHA: I’1ll come, Doctor. If you find Tegan, perhaps I will find my father.\nSESHA: (FX: THE TAKER HUSK TWITCHING INTO LIFE. THE SHADES’ CHITTERING\nTURNS: INTO A SWELLING CACOPHONY )\nNYSSA: Doctor, look!!\nTURLOUGH: Our taker’s having some kind of fit.\nNYSSA: We knew there was residual power in the cells, but...\nTAKER: Clean.\nSESHA: Sir John’s hand, shield me!\nDOCTOR: The Taker’s remains haven’t spoken before?\nTURLOUGH: It hasn’t moved either.\nTAKER: Forever. Only us. Heal. Take flesh. Make fresh. Only us.\nNYSSA: That’s a Taker’s voice... But the words are the Shades’, aren’t they?\nNYSSA: 75\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 76\nDOCTOR: They’re animating it. Synthetic flesh and artificial synapses, seems they can enter the form and inhabit it.\nSESHA: The Shades are always out in force when the Takers walk.\nNYSSA: Drawn to their physical stability, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Can you understand me?\nTAKER: Section. Must leave. Must find. Heal.\nDOCTOR: Who are we speaking to?\nTAKER: We are many. Any. We are any. Takers take. Takers keep. Heal. Keep takers. Keep take. Keep sake.\nTURLOUGH: It’s just babbling.\nDOCTOR: Or the last echoes of consciousness. I think the Shades were once living beings. They were turned by some cataclysm into these... revenants. That’s why so many linger at the Place of Ghosts. I’m wondering if that’s yet another name on Chodor that’s lost its meaning.\nSESHA: What?\nNYSSA: The Doctor believes your colony is descended from the patients of a hospital ship.\nDOCTOR: Your people’s persistence in doing nothing but holding tight to the wreckage of your ancestors’ lives left a vacuum at the heart of Purity. To fill that absence, the simple rituals of cleanliness in a hospital ward have been conflated with a handful of half-remembered maxims into the basis for your entire culture.\nSESHA: That’s... all we are?\nSESHA: 76\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 77\nNYSSA: How could things get so out of hand?\nDOCTOR: Something must have happened to the real medical practitioners - without their guidance, the patients were left to their own devices. Something certainly happened at the Section in the Ghost Place, the disruption matrix was unlike anything I’ve seen.\nTAKER: Section. Sickness. Live. Let live. Give. Live. Take. (CONTINUE\nUNDER: - )\nTURLOUGH: Seemed to strike a chord.\nNYSSA: Richter’s Syndrome. Does that mean anything to you? Richter’s?\nDOCTOR: Apparently it does.\nSESHA: What is Richter’s Syndrome?\nNYSSA: A devastating illness. There may have been traces of it here...\nTAKER: (SLURRING) The Shades must not take us.\nDOCTOR: That’s the real Taker. It’s reasserted control over its speech circuits.\nSESHA: Why have you persecuted us? Why take my father, and Tegan, and so many others before them?\nTAKER: I am Battlespace Auto-Medic Unit G6. Your welfare must be maintained.\nTAKER: TZ\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: EXT: TAKERS’ SEGREGATED COMMUNITY ZONE. NIGHT\nANULF: I cannot believe all you have told me, Tegan. I ruled Purity for twenty years. And in a single day.. I knew Mertil to be ambitious, but this?\nTEGAN: At least Sesha isn’t here with you. If her condition was life- threatening, the Takers would jump in, right?\nANULF: Perhaps she is already dead. She said.. she would never forgive me for marrying Mertil.\nTEGAN: Trust me - she didn’t mean it. (PAUSE) When they see me out in these communal areas, Anulf, aren’t people going to start running for the hills at the unclean sight of me?\nANULF: There is no fear. Everything is clean here, stranger.\nTEGAN: It’s just like Purity, only it smells better. Properly clean. No Shades. All this time, these robot Taker things have been bringing your sick or dying people here to be made well?\nANULF: It seems so. I have devoted so much of my rule to devising ways to defend Purity and attack the Takers. And yet they have made my heart whole so quickly, and just with machines. I’ve met again with old friends I thought would have died of their wounds or sickness, seen the children of some who were taken when I was young.\nTEGAN: But where did the Takers come from?\nANULF: They have always been here.\nTEGAN: And your people are allowed to do what they like, apart from leave? Even start families?\nTEGAN: 78\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 79\nANULF: The Takers take care of us all. They house us. Keep us clean with special air and water, filtered through a.. a sterile wall, I think they called it. Like an invisible bubble that keeps out the dirt and even the Shades. We believed the river so filthy we could not cross it without dying. And yet all the time, on just the other side lay this secret place...\nTEGAN: They keep an eye on you too, I see. How thoughtful of them. Fountains, fields, peace and quiet, great views. (TAKES A BIG BREATH) It’s the prettiest prison I ever saw. But it’s not keeping me.\nTEGAN: SCENE 52: EXT: CHODOR FOREST. NIGHT.\nNYSSA: Auto-medics? That’s all the Takers are — medical drones?\nDOCTOR: Designed to treat the wounded in combat situations, and to evacuate them — hence their transmat capability, for instant patient transportation. The glowing orange skullcap not only provides light, but marks out the medics in poor visibility.\nTURLOUGH: The ones that chased us quoted combat regulations at us. They must think they’re still on a war footing.\nNYSSA: But what did it mean, ‘Your welfare must be maintained’?\nSESHA: (TO TAKER) Well? You abduct us, silence us...\nTAKER: We are programmed to heal you. In secret.\nDOCTOR: Oh? What prompted that decision?\nTAKER: Forty-four patients with suspected Richter’s Syndrome contracted in Dravidian war zone. Post-crash: Housed in quarantined section. Prognosis: No cure. Risk of infecting majority of ward. Action recommended under active combat regulation two-zero-five: euthanasia.\nTAKER: 79\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 80\nNYSSA: There was no cure other than to kill all those people?\nDOCTOR: Not one known to auto-medics in the 28% century it seems.\nTAKER: For the good... of the... community.\nDOCTOR: How many times have I heard that justification for the worst atrocities?\nTURLOUGH: Doesn’t look as though we’ll get any more out of him. His energy must be completely depleted.\nSESHA: We’ve always wondered where the people of the Section went...\nTURLOUGH: Up in smoke, it seems.\nNYSSA: That’s not funny.\nDOCTOR: And not necessarily true. Something tells me the proposed euthanasia of the sufferers went badly wrong.\nNYSSA: The energy blast you told us about — an outrush of intra- dimensional energy.\nDOCTOR: Tearing through different layers of reality, mauling mind and matter — and creating the Shades.\nSESHA: (SOUNDING WEAK) They’re our... ancestors?\nDOCTOR: And they’ve been haunting you ever since. Living ghosts forged\nDOCTOR: in the fallout of some tremendous explosion.\nSESHA: All this time, they’ve been trying... to speak to us?\nNYSSA: Sesha, you’re burning up.\nNYSSA: 80\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 81\nSESHA: ifm allright.\nDOCTOR: Let me see. Hmm, your pulse is quickening too.\nTURLOUGH: A pity this Taker can’t do his job.\nSESHA: If only it could tell us more.\nDOCTOR: We must find others who can and get treatment for you - at the\nDOCTOR: Takers’ hideaway.\nNYSSA: I’m sure it’s close by — Hey!\nTURLOUGH: What’s that light?!?\nJESTAN: There! That’s them.\nSESHA: Night-lighters. Jestan’s brought half of Purity after us.\nNYSSA: Turlough, look! Those boulders on the next hillside.\nTURLOUGH: That’s them! The way in, I’m sure of it. But the last time we were there they tried to kill us.\nDOCTOR: I imagine Mertil and Jestan have something similar in mind.\nDOCTOR: Sesha, can you walk?\nSESHA: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Then run!\nDOCTOR: 81\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: EXT: CHODOR FOREST. NIGHT.\nMERTIL: There. Jestan’s picked out the strangers. Switch on our night- lighter. Hurry.\nMERTIL: We've got them pinned against the cliff-face. They’re trapped!\nMERTIL: SCENE 54: EXT: OUTSIDE TAKERS’ TUNNEL. NIGHT\nTURLOUGH: Nice to know where the other half of Purity got to.\nSESHA: Mertil’s so close.\nDOCTOR: Is this the place?\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: That light’s so blinding... but, I think... Yes. Here, between the two boulders. You can feel the force-field barrier.\nTURLOUGH: Hold up the Taker. It disabled the barrier before.\nNYSSA: Nothing.\nTURLOUGH: Give it here!\nDOCTOR: It’s no good. Using its vocal circuits, fighting off the Shades — it’s exhausted the last of its power.\nMERTIL: (FAR OFF) Jestan! Attack together!\nSESHA: They’re moving in from both sides.\nDOCTOR: Nowhere left to run.\nDOCTOR: 82\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 83\nTURLOUGH: Think of something, Doctor — they’1l pull us to pieces!\nTURLOUGH: (WE HEAR BOTH PARTIES CONVERGE — FOOTFALLS, THE CLANK OF NIGHT-\nLIGHTERS: ETC, APPROACHING ON THE DOCTOR’S GROUP)\nJESTAN: It’s safe to approach. The night-lighters dazzle them, they cannot see your faces.\nMERTIL: (CLOSER) The Strangers brought Sesha back from the dead with their powers. She is theirs now — theirs and the Takers’. They would have her rule you on their depraved behalf.\nSESHA: (UNWELL) Mertil tried to kill me - like she killed my mother.\nJESTAN: Lies. The strangers have made her their puppet!\nSESHA: No...\nNYSSA: Doctor, her condition’s getting worse.\nDOCTOR: Turlough, keep trying with the Taker. There might just be enough latent power still in there.\nMERTIL: You put Purity under the spell of sleep so you could fly back to the dirt and darkness with Sesha’s soul. Now we must return her to her natural rest.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you make it sound almost poetical, Mertil. This is murder you’re talking about. Killing. Slaughter in cold blood. (LOUDER, ADDRESSING CROWDS) If she cares so little for her own stepdaughter, how much can she care for you?\nTURLOUGH: Oh, no...\nTURLOUGH: NYSSA3: More Takers!\nTURLOUGH: 83\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: EXT: TAKERS’ SEGREGATED COMMUNITY ZONE. NIGHT\nTEGAN: All right, Anulf, so it’s more of a rest home than a prison. I still prefer to look after myself.\nANULF: For those of Purity, I think it soon becomes a refuge. Can you imagine how it feels to have fought against so tireless an enemy as dirt and disease your whole life, then to find yourself safe in a place where such things no longer matter?\nTEGAN: OK, I get that. But why can’t anyone ever go back to Purity and tell the others they’re all right? Why the kidnap, the fear and the secrecy?\nANULF: The Takers say it must be this way.\nTEGAN: And everyone just accepts that?\nANULF: In time, they have to. This community is sealed in with the good air. There is no way back out. (LOWERS VOICE) Only the tunnel. My condition meant the Takers could not drug me or dissolve me into the air for fear of killing me.\nTEGAN: I heard you call out in the forest...\nANULF: They had to carry me. They made a tunnel appear in the rock that stretched all the way to here.\nTEGAN: Then, if we could find the other end of that tunnel...\nANULF: Impossible. It is shielded with an invisible wall so the Shades cannot follow them inside.\nTEGAN: You’ve completely given up, haven’t you! A couple of days ago you were Purity’s leader. Are you going to turn your back on your people? On Sesha? On the woman who killed your wife, who’s trying to take your place?\nANULF: My wife-? My wife fell in an accident.\nANULF: 84\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 85\nTEGAN: I’m sorry, Anulf. She was helped to fall by Mertil.\nANULF: What?\nTEGAN: Mertil killed her.\nANULF: No... (TURNS AND WALKS AWAY)\nTEGAN: I heard her brag about it! You can’t just walk away from this, Anulf!\nANULF: Precisely, I cannot. Mertil is many things but she did not kill my wife. My wife still lives - after a fashion. The Takers found her when she fell and brought her here. (PAUSE) Forgive me, I would prefer to be alone.\nTEGAN: (TO SELF) Handled that well, didn’t I? (PAUSE, TO TAKER) What\nTEGAN: are you looking at?\nTAKER: Tegan Jovanka. You will accompany me to in-patient processing.\nTEGAN: If I know what’s good for me?\nTAKER: Yes.\nTAKER: 85\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: EXT: OUTSIDE TAKERS’ TUNNEL.

Get ready to jump through.\nMERTIL: Page 86\nMERTIL: For Sesha, death will be a mercy. People of Purity, we all will\nMERTIL: die if we do not kill Sesha and the strangers now!\nJESTAN: Kill them all!\nDOCTOR: Now!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR: 86\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 87"

Sesha, it’s Tegan. Your father’s here, Sesha. not just him...\nTURLOUGH: Her father. So you found him in the end then?\nTAKER: Tegan Jovanka, these humanoids are your fellow travellers? There are no more?\nTEGAN: Thats. 21ght.\nTAKER: They have caused interference with our monitors and used subterfuge to enter this camp. They will be disposed of according to active combat regulation two-zero-one.\nTEGAN: No!\nTURLOUGH: You don’t understand! We... we’re the rescue party.\nDOCTOR: Yes! The rescue party you’ve spent a century waiting for.\nTAKER: Continuing treatment.\nNYSSA: They need rescuing quickly. Their power’s wearing down.\nTEGAN: Right, it told me that too.\nTAKER: Prove you are personnel from a genuine rescue mission.\nDOCTOR: Can you prove otherwise?\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: And\nTAKER: Before any action can be taken, confirmation of rescue status\nTAKER: is needed from Earth Empire Command.\nDOCTOR: Only you can’t get it, can you?

Now we can destroy!\nMERTIL: (FX: WE DETECT A NEW NOTE TO THE SHADES’ GIBBERING — SINISTER,\nDERANGED: LAUGHTER)\nDERANGED: 92\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. TAKERS’ CAVE (PROCESSING AREA). NIGHT\nDOCTOR: Auto-medic, we need to know what happened on the day of the quarantine.\nTAKER: #2: Historical testimony has no relevance to current situation.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. Learning from the past is the only way to build a future. But you auto-medics had no past experience of containing an outbreak of Richter’s Syndrome, did you?\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: All but two human medical practitioners perished in the crash. All communications were destroyed. We could not connect with Central Medical Register.\nDOCTOR: And so you concluded the simplest way forwards was to eliminate the sufferers.\nTEGAN: That’s horrible.\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: One senior surgeon supported the decision. One staff-doctor did not. She encouraged other patients to prevent our actions. They brought weapons. They fired upon us and struck the damaged engines.\nNYSSA: What sort of engines?\nTAKER: #2: Subspace dilation drive.\nDOCTOR: So there’s our outburst of energy — a percussive impact on a quantum flux generator. Layers of warp energy sent shattering outward through reality, transforming humans and medics alike.\nTEGAN: Into the Shades?\nTAKER: #2: Into intra-dimensional contaminants.\nNYSSA: Into helpless chimera, left in terrible pain.\nNYSSA: 93\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 94\nDOCTOR: Gently, Nyssa. We haven’t heard all its story.\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: The surgeon was eliminated in the conflagration. The staff- doctor became Purity’s leader. Our presence, and that of the intra-dimensional contaminants, caused mental disturbances in the humans. Fear. Alarm. Paranoia.\nTURLOUGH: Can you blame them?\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: Staff-doctor banished us from the Bay. All mention of the auto- medics and the events of that day forbidden. Soon after, she too died of warp radiation.\nDOCTOR: But you couldn’t just abandon your patients, could you? Just as you couldn’t go on causing them such distress, or disobey direct instructions from a superior.\nTEGAN: So the only way they could continue to care for the people was in secret?\nTAKER: #2:\nTAKER: It was the only way. It took the ten of us many years to sterilise the area beyond the river, shut out the Contaminants, and build a hospital from salvaged parts.\nNYSSA: And all the time, the survivors held tight for a rescue that never came. But if they ever became ill, you spirited them away.\nTAKER: #2: We could not allow them to see us. So we could cause them no distress.\nTEGAN: You stole their sick and injured without explanation, and didn’t think it would cause them distress?\nDOCTOR: They’re programmed for physical medicine, not psychiatry. They took the staff-doctor’s words at face value.\nNYSSA: And for all this time the Shades have been ignored. They’re desperate to be healed, to know peace again.\nNYSSA: 94\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 95\nTEGAN: (MUTTERS) It’s getting worse.\nTAKER: #2: (SLURRED) Our purpose is to heal humans.\nDOCTOR: And so it’s gone on, year after year. The Takers subservient to their programming, the survivors living out their rituals — neither side with any real understanding of what it means to live at all.\nTAKER: #1: Warning.

Did you ever imagine...?\nANTAN: Why did that half-there thing open the way?\nMERTIL: It sought to escape us.\nANTAN: You don’t think this could be a trap to take us all?\nMERTIL: We are too strong. Too pure. We have spent our lives preparing for this day. Thirty men and women stand with us, to be honoured always. And all who’ve fled will have their muck- stuffed hearts scrubbed to pulp upon our return.\nANTAN: I never heard the Shades this way before.\nMERTIL: Even they sense the importance of this day.

The humans have entered the tunnel.\nTURLOUGH: The Shades must have got in with them.\nTAKER: #2: They are advancing on our settlement.\nDOCTOR: Good! Don’t you see, you can re-integrate your worlds. Once the people of Purity see you mean them no harm, find that those who've been taken are treated well, they won’t fight you.\nTAKER: #2: We can only heal in secret. The humans are armed. There will be violence.\nTEGAN: How did Mertil even get in? Why didn’t they set off any alarms?\nNYSSA: In theory, only Takers can open the barriers.\nTURLOUGH: Including that husk we’ve been carrying round with us.\nDOCTOR: Where did you leave it?\nTURLOUGH: I.. I must have left it behind at the mouth to the tunnel. Like\nTURLOUGH: this place, it had no power.\nDOCTOR: (SLOWLY) Perhaps it wanted us to think that.\nNYSSA: Medic, we came through a barrier at this end of the tunnel.\nTAKER: #1:\nTAKER: Power failure... will leave barrier weak...

Why?\nDOCTOR: Solid, plastic flesh, a mind fixed in steel and circuits. To know a stable form after so long - for a Shade, that’s purity. (TURNS TO TAKER 2) Medic, you must talk with Mertil and her followers before it’s too late —\nTAKER: #2: Takers keep. Keep takers. Cleanse. Heal. (IT GRABS DOCTOR BY THROAT) Kill!

I’m the Doctor.\nANULF: The ancient word of power!\nDOCTOR: Power, yes. And that’s about all that has an effect on these possessed Takers.\nANULF: Tegan, I saw you taken, and I followed you.\nTEGAN: I’m glad you did. And there’s someone else I bet is glad about it, too.\nTEGAN: 99\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 100\nSESHA: (COMING ROUND) F-Father? Is that you-?\nANULF: Sesha...!\nTAKER: #2: Cleanse.

There’s ten of those things, unmovable, pretty much indestructible - and with a very tight grip.\nNYSSA: Why are the Shades doing this? I thought they wanted peace?\nDOCTOR: A hundred years in formless agony — enough to drive anyone insane. The sterility wall can’t have helped, charging the local atmosphere with disruptive particles.\nNYSSA: I could feel them in my mind outside the TARDIS. Such a longing, a yearning.\nDOCTOR: I felt them too, in the Ghost Place. They helped me get away from Jestan.\nANULF: The Shades were always out in numbers when the Takers walked.\nNYSSA: You thought they were drawn to the Takers. But perhaps they were hunting them.\nDOCTOR: And it’s only now the Takers have been weakened by the power failures that the Shades have been able to take control of them.\nTURLOUGH: Ready to take their revenge on the humans who refused to listen to them.\nTEGAN: Doctor, there are so many people here. Families. Children.\nTURLOUGH: (GHOULISH) And once the Shades work out how to use the Takers’ matter transporters...\nTURLOUGH: 101\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 102\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Turlough. The Shades don’t seem to have mastered that particular function of their borrowed bodies yet. Evacuation, I think, is the only option.\nANULF: But we have held tight all our lives.\nSESHA: And it’s been slowly killing us, Father. We must go.\nANULF: And what of those who cannot leave? Those in ‘intensive care’ here... like your mother.\nSESHA: (AFFECTED) My mother?\nANULF: The Takers’ machines keep her heart beating. But she lives.\nANULF: SCENE 67: EXT.

I must speak with him.\nANTAN: Please, Mertil, not here, not now. Sesha and the strangers will try to kill us for what we’ve done.\nMERTIL: Listen to the screams. Who’s screaming? Are all those taken held in such agony?\nANTAN: Anulf is not. The spike-haired stranger is not.\nMERTIL: Everything is tricks here, Antan. Don’t be deceived.

NIGHT\nSESHA: Father, if my mother is alive, I must see her.\nANULF: Sesha, I know how you must feel but this is not the time.\nSESHA: There may not be any other!\nTEGAN: Doctor, the power drains — they seem to be coming faster.\nNYSSA: It’s affecting the Takers as well as their equipment. The power must be broadcast from a central source.\nTURLOUGH: If we wait long enough, might the Takers wear down altogether?\nDOCTOR: That power source has lasted for a hundred years — it could take another fifty to exhaust itself. Unless of course, we give it a helping hand.\nNYSSA: You mean, discharge the energy somehow?\nDOCTOR: Cut the supply. The simplest way to stop them in their tracks.\nTEGAN: But it’ll stop everything else too. The lights, the sterility wall...\nTURLOUGH: (REALISES) Intensive care.\nSESHA: You can’t.\nSESHA: You just can’t.\nANULF: Being leader, Sesha, means making decisions for everyone, not just for yourself.\nANULF: 103\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 104\nDOCTOR: There might be a way to maintain power to the essential systems while taking it from the Shade-Takers.\nNYSSA: Doctor, look!\nTAKER: Take flesh. Make fresh. Only us. Take pill. Take kill.\nTURLOUGH: They’re coming.\nDOCTOR: Anulf, do you know the way to the power supply?\nANULF: No.\nDOCTOR: Then we’ll start looking near the intensive care ward — any emergency power would be routed there as a priority.\nDOCTOR: Come on!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 69: INT. CORRIDOR IN TAKERS’ COMMUNITY ZONE. NIGHT\nANULF: The Intensive Care ward is this way.\nSESHA: If those things have harmed my mother, I’1l hack them to pieces!\nDOCTOR: Wait! Look, threaded through the venting hatch.\nTEGAN: Cables.\nNYSSA: Heavy-duty cables, by the looks of it.\nTURLOUGH: But the Takers operate on broadcast power, not a wired system.\nTURLOUGH: 104\nDOCTOR WHO: PURITY by Stephen Cole Page 105\nDOCTOR: Which means the life-support machines must run on a smaller,\nDOCTOR: isolated circuit and won’t be affected. Tegan, Nyssa, go with Anulf and Sesha.

(HE PICKS SOMETHING UP) We must help them.\nMERTIL: Help me, husband. As a child I knew truth like spotless white. Now I see it stained red and dark. I have pulled the nails from my fingers so no mud may get behind them, blood hardens the cracks I’ve scrubbed into my face, but everywhere I look I still see only dirt and sickness.\nSESHA: Because the sickness is in you. It’s all you’ve ever looked for.\nTEGAN: Now come in if you’re going to or get out.\nTAKER: Come. Run. Dumb. Close. Clean. Kill.\nTEGAN: I mean it. These doors are closing.\nMERTIL: Perhaps they are.

The Taker’s proximity to the systems triggered the settings menu, and I used your scalpel to sever the couplings and isolate the wired eclrcurt.,\nTURLOUGH: So all that broadcast power discharged directly into the Taker?\nDOCTOR: And since they share a neural network, from him it flowed into all the others.\nANTAN: What about the Shades?\nDOCTOR: They would’ve had time to leave the melting bodies.
