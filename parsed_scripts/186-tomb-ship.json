He get through?\nVIRNA: (STARTLED) Hisko! — Never mind Rek. What about you and Heff? You made any progress with that wall?\nHISKO: No, Mother.\nVIRNA: Perhaps, and it’s only a theory, perhaps that’s because you’re not trying hard enough.\nHISKO: We have been, but there doesn’t seem to be a way around, and the stone’s too thick to break. Heff reckons we need to go back to the other trap.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 6\nVIRNA: (LOUD) I don’t want to hear what your idiot brother reckons. All I want to hear is the sound of that wall being hammered. (CALLING OUT) You hear that, Heff?\nVIRNA: Good. (TO HISKO, KINDLY) I know I’m hard on you boys, but we can’t afford to get sidetracked. You know what’s waiting for us inside. It’s meant for us.\nHISKO: The family.\nVIRNA: Me and my boys. And no-one else.

I’m sure it’1l sort itself out.\nNYSSA: I meant, so we can see something-?\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Yes, it is rather dark. Black as the Void of Camilatros, in fact.\nNYSSA: Well, we’re not in the Void of Camilatros now.\nDOCTOR: I should hope not. That was a bad day. I lost a shoe.\nNYSSA: Most likely we’re only gone as far as the cellar of Mr Whitlock’s house.\nDOCTOR: Let’s find out, shall we?\nDOCTOR: There. Much better.\nNYSSA: You could see the light switch in the dark?\nDOCTOR: No, but I could hear it. Just the faintest photon hum. It’s not\nDOCTOR: strictly a switch, rather a photon converter. Creating light from air molecules.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 8\nNYSSA: Very advanced. But with stone walls. Perhaps we’re underground.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BRIEF FOOTSTEPS TO WALL) Perhaps...\nNYSSA: Can you hear the wall talk, too?\nDOCTOR: (EAR TO WALL) No, but if you put your ear to it, it does tell you something.\nNYSSA: Which is?\nDOCTOR: Let’s go and see for ourselves, shall we?

And then we should leave.\nVIRNA: No. We just need to find another way.\nHEFF: You find it, then. There’s traps in every direction except one — the way back. That’s where I’m going. You coming, Hisko?\nHISKO: Well...\nVIRNA: (CALM) Stay where you are, Hisko.\nHISKO: Um, okay.\nVIRNA: I’m doing this for the family, Heff. Don’t you want the best for our family?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 10\nHEFF: What family?! When we got here, I had two more brothers than I do now. You keep saying Rek is coming back, but I know he isn’t. And then there was what happened to Biss...\nHISKO: That wasn’t Mother’s fault!\nHEFF: And where’s Murs?\nVIRNA: Murs has what it takes. He’ll be fine. You could do with trying to be more like your brother. Try not being a coward.\nHEFF: I’m no coward.\nVIRNA: Prove it. Because there’s no going back.\nHEFF: We could get help and come back.\nVIRNA: You know family rules. No outsiders.\nHISKO: Hey, where’s that light coming from?\nVIRNA: Arm yourselves! Now!\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) Identify yourself!\nMURS: (OFF) Don’t shoot! It’s me — Murs!\nHISKO: Murs is back! Look, Heff. He really is fine. Heff’s sorry, Mother. Aren’t you, Heff?\nVIRNA: Be quiet, boy. (TO MURS) Murs, what’s the matter?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 11\nMURS: (APPROACHING, BREATHLESS) Mother. There’s.. there’s someone else here.\nHISKO: The.. things. We know.\nMURS: Not them. People. In the Upper Levels. I heard them, from a distance. I came straight back here.\nVIRNA: (NOT MASSIVELY SURPRISED) People, is it.\nMURS: A man and a woman.\nVIRNA: We’re not alone, then.\nHEFF: Mother? You’re not surprised? Why is it you’re not [surprised]\nVIRNA: I’m not scared, that’s what I’m not. Murs, show me the way to these... ‘people’.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 12\nNYSSA: This passage seems to go on forever. Where are we going to end up?\nDOCTOR: I have a theory about that.\nNYSSA: And you don’t want to ruin the surprise. I know you too well, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (PUT OUT) Oh. Do you really think so, [Nyssa?]\nNYSSA: (CUTTING IN) There’s something up ahead. Do you see? Against the wall. It looks like a person.\nDOCTOR: If it is, they’re not moving.\nNYSSA: They could be hurt. (FX: RUNNING; DOCTOR FOLLOWS) (CALLS OUT) Are you alright? Don’t move, we’re coming to help— [you]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING, SLOWING) Nyssa. I don’t think they’re alright.\nNYSSA: (GASPS, STOPPING) Oh, how horrible!\nDOCTOR: There’s almost nothing left.\nNYSSA: Do you think it was one of the people who made this place?\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINING THE BODY) No. Decomposition has taken a few years, maybe a decade or two. This place has been here a lot longer than this chap.\nNYSSA: What killed him?\nDOCTOR: Too little left to tell.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 13\nNYSSA: Doctor, you don’t have to pretend. There are teethmarks on the bones.\nDOCTOR: Looks more like a mark made by mandibles. Very large mandibles.\nNYSSA: Some sort of giant insect? I’m beginning to like this place less and less.\nDOCTOR: Just a little further. If I’m right about this place, it’1l be worth it.\nNYSSA: Left or right, then?\nDOCTOR: Left, I think.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 14\nHISKO: (SOTTO) It’s alright, they’re heading away from us.\nHEFF: Not what you were expecting, Mother?\nVIRNA: (SOTTO) Shh! — You heard the man, Heff. He thinks he knows what’s in here. So we better make sure they don’t get to it first, hadn’t we?\nHISKO: I don’t know, I thought they just sounded lost...\nMURS: Ssh!\nHISKO: No need to whisper, they’ve gone now.\nVIRNA: We’re taking no chances. It’s obvious where they’re going. Heff, you’re with me. Hisko, Murs — you take the long way round. Follow this corridor, turn right at the end and it’ll lead to the gallery. Make sure they don’t get away from us. And keep quiet!\nHISKO: But what do we do if we see those... things?! (GETS HIT BY MURS) Ow!\nMURS: Quiet!\nVIRNA: Thank you, Murs. And don’t waste all your ammo on “those\nVIRNA: things”. We may need it for our new friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND NYSSA ENTER AND STOP, ECHOES OF VERY LARGE ROOM)\nNYSSA: (GASPS) That’s much more of a spectacle.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it just? I rather think we’ve found the way in, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: The way in to what?\nDOCTOR: Well, if I were building a giant tomb complex, this is definitely the kind of room I’d put at the front.\nNYSSA: The ceiling must be a hundred feet high, at least.\nDOCTOR: At this point, yes. But it tapers away into the distance, see?\nNYSSA: Like a pyramid, balanced on its side!\nDOCTOR: And at the far end — a door, I think. Shall we?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) These pillars, they align perfectly. From this angle they look like a solid wall.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Indeed they do. Wonderful craftsmanship.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Something strange about the carvings on them, though. They don’t seem to be pictures — well, not of anything I recognise. But the shapes don’t repeat enough to make a viable language.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s not a language — or the TARDIS would have translated it. No clear names, either. Perhaps it’s not a tomb.\nNYSSA: It feels like a tomb. Even if it is beautiful.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: I wonder...\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: The God-King dies, and we mourn in the darkness left behind.\nNYSSA: A hologram!\nDOCTOR: A moving fresco. Stand back, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Those figures, they seem to be carrying something up to the door. I think it’s a body.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that must be the God-King. This is his funeral cortege, I presume.\nNYSSA: Hence the music.\nDOCTOR: Quite. We might be the first people to see and hear all this in thousands of years, or more.\nNYSSA: Incredible. How did you make it work?\nDOCTOR: These carvings aren’t carvings — they’re photon sensors. Same as the lights in the corridor.\nNYSSA: They’re so vivid. If they weren’t so small, you’d think they were real people.\nDOCTOR: Very sophisticated technology. (WORRIED) I wonder what else these people could do.\nNYSSA: So if the carvings control the display...\nDOCTOR: Let’s try the next one, shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: He dies again and we shall rejoice eternally in his divine light! (A BEAT, THEN REPEAT THROUGH: )\nNYSSA: Now the mourners are all pointing at the sky.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A star is forming.\nNYSSA: ‘His Divine Light’. They must believe he’1ll be reborn as a star.\nDOCTOR: It’s a common enough belief, but that’s not what the voice said. He ‘dies again’, it said. And that’s a belief peculiar to just one race — the Arrit.\nNYSSA: The Arrit?\nDOCTOR: Just an incredibly advanced and incredibly ancient civilisation. If they’d survived, they might have rivalled the Time Lords in their abilities.\nNYSSA: It said their God-King died twice?\nDOCTOR: Well, they had a very peculiar way of entombing their dead kings. They... (REALISING) Oh no. Stupid! How did I not know?! We have to leave. Right now.\nNYSSA: Doctor, are you — (FINDS SHE CAN’T MOVE) Oh!\nDOCTOR: No time. I’1ll explain when we’re safely a few millennia away. — Well, don’t just stand there, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Doctor, I can’t move!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 18\nHEFF: (CRYING OUT, FALLING) Ow!\nVIRNA: (QUIET, URGENT) Get up, Heff. Do you want to give us away to those two strangers?\nHEFF: (GETTING UP) Why not? They might know a way out of this place. They might even be able to help.\nVIRNA: Feel free to ask them for all the help in the galaxy. Once I’ve shot them.\nHEFF: Don’t be stupid, Mother. They didn’t look remotely dangerous!\nHEFF: You’re kidding. You won’t use that on me.\nVIRNA: You think you’re the brains of the family, Heff? So, since you’re so smart, tell me this — what are the odds of there being more than one group in here today?\nHEFF: Fairly small, I suppose.\nVIRNA: So they must have followed us in. They must be after the same thing we are.\nHEFF: I don’t know. Maybe...\nVIRNA: Maybe? One of your brothers is dead for sure, and we’ve got to assume that something might have happened to Rek too. You think the strangers had nothing to do with that?\nHEFF: I didn’t think of that.\nVIRNA: No, you didn’t, did you? So you just help me defend the family against these outsiders. You help me avenge your brothers.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: You have to try, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: I can’t, Doctor. My feet feel so heavy. I can’t lift them! Even moving at all is...\nNYSSA: (LABOURED) No! Stay there. If you get too close, you might get trapped, too.\nDOCTOR: Stay calm. I need to find out why you can’t move. (LOOKING AROUND) Maybe there’s something in the holograms...\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO:\nDOCTOR: (THREATENING) Those who would seek the God-King will feel the draw of death. It will come from below. It will fall from above. It will move them back and forward. It will turn their own heart against them. Only those who would die will survive.\nDOCTOR: That wasn’t very encouraging. But it does tell me one thing — it’s deliberate.\nNYSSA: Doctor, please! What’s happening to me?\nDOCTOR: The hologram was showing this room, only it looked different somehow. The figures were closing the door at the end.\nNYSSA: What does it mean?\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) It draws from below. I think I know what’s happening, but I can’t believe it. (TO NYSSA) I’m going to throw a stone towards you and then...\nDOCTOR: Impossible.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 20\nNYSSA: (AFRAID, BREATHLESS) It just seemed to freeze in the air, then it fell, like it was being pulled down.\nDOCTOR: It’s a gravity trap. The local gravity around you is increasing.\nNYSSA: It’s getting stronger! I can’t... stand! (COLLAPSES)\nDOCTOR: Just hold on, Nyssa!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 21\nMURS: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Hisko, keep up! What you doing back there?\nHISKO: I thought I heard something.\nMURS: There’s nothing but your imagination! We don’t have time for this.\nHISKO: I was just looking. There’s all these cracks in the rock. Big enough fov...\nMURS: Forget that. We need to take care of those outsiders.\nHISKO: (GETTING UP) Alright. I’m coming. (MUMBLING) But I did hear it.\nMURS: If we see them, leave the shooting to me. I know what your aim is like.\nMURS: (FX: DISTANT INSECTOID CHITTERING, CLICKING SOUNDS, CLEARLY A\nLARGE: NUMBER OF THEM)\nHISKO: See? You hear that? It’s them! More of those giant insect things we met before. — There, at the end of the corridor!\nMURS: I can handle this.\nHISKO: Murs... I don’t think that’s a good idea...\nMURS: Get behind me, Hisko.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 22\nMURS: (SHOOTING) Come on, you insect creeps! Come on!\nHISKO: (SHOUTING OVER NOISE) Murs, we have to get out of here!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 23\nNYSSA: The gravity... it’s crushing me...!\nDOCTOR: Hold on, Nyssa! The effect seems to be isolated to those three steps. Think, Doctor, think!\nNYSSA: Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: Wait! Steps, of course! In the hologram where the door was open, there were no steps. This was all a slope.\nNYSSA: What... difference...\nDOCTOR: All the difference, Nyssa! I think I need to open the door, and then the stairs will move into a slope. You’d slide right out of the gravity field.\nVIRNA: (ENTERING) That is a good theory.\nDOCTOR: Sorry. Bit busy here.\nHEFF: Stay right there.\nNYSSA: (IN PAIN) Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: I don’t know who you are, but my friend needs help. I’m going to the door.\nVIRNA: Heff.\nDOCTOR: There’s no need to shoot! We’re not armed! We’re not here to hurt anybody!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 24\nVIRNA: We'll find out the truth of that...

Come on! — Well, I’m not hanging around. —\nMURS: (OFF) Hisko, you coward! Get back here and — (OVERWHELMED BY INSECTS) No! Get back! Aargh!\nHISKO: Murs? (BEAT SILENCE) Sorry, Murs. — Still, least I’m alright.\nJHANNI: (APPEARING) I wouldn’t say that just yet.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 26\nNYSSA: Doctor... it hurts...\nDOCTOR: Hold on, Nyssa!\nVIRNA: Don’t move.\nDOCTOR: Please. Just let me get to the door, then we can talk properly. This seems to be a case of mistaken identity.\nVIRNA: There’s no point, anyhow. That door doesn’t open. Of course, we weren’t stupid enough to trigger the gravity trap when we first arrived here, but we’ve tried every way we know to open that door. So your theory is wrong. You can’t save her, either way.\nDOCTOR: Let me try. Please!\nHEFF: I get it now. Don’t you see, Mother? — (RUNNING UP STEPS) You have to trigger the trap to get the door to open!\nDOCTOR: Quite possibly, yes!\nNYSSA: (GASPING) Please! Please...\nVIRNA: Heff! Where do you think you’re going!?\nHEFF: (RUNNING, OFF) Proving a point.\nVIRNA: Stop right there, boy!\nHEFF: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Come on. (EXERTION) Move!\nDOCTOR: It’s working! The steps are moving!\nDOCTOR: (FX: A LOUDER RUMBLE AS THE STEPS BECOME A SLOPE — AND NYSSA IS\nRELEASED: )\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby\nNYSSA: (GASPING, COUGHING) I can mo-ove!

[Still, she won’t be happy if he’s got himself eaten]\nHISKO: He’s gone. Happy now, whoever you are?\nJHANNI: Yes. Now — choose.\nHISKO: Choose? Choose what?\nJHANNI: Which way you want to die.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 29\nVIRNA: You two, move over there.\nVIRNA: Far enough. Now tell me why you’ve been killing my boys.\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) You don’t understand. I don’t know who you think we are, and I honestly don’t care. The only thing that’s important is that we all have to get off this ship. Right now.\nNYSSA: (RECOVERING) A ship? I thought we were underground...\nVIRNA: Heff, search that one. See if she’s got a radio on her.\nNYSSA: A radio? I don’t understand...\nHEFF: You and me both. Still.. Hands up, where I can see them.\nDOCTOR: I’ve told you. We need to get off this ship at once.\nVIRNA: I’ve no intention of doing anything but walking through that door, now my son has so helpfully opened it.\nHEFF: Nothing on her. Especially not a radio.\nVIRNA: I have to do everything myself? Check her again!\nDOCTOR: Listen to me! Do you know what this place is?\nVIRNA: Heff? Tell him.\nHEFF: Last resting place of the Arrit God-King Tarak-takayo, with all the treasures of an ancient and extinct race. Mother’s been telling me stories about it all my life.\nDOCTOR: Do those stories mention that it’s not just a tomb?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 30\nVIRNA: It’s a treasure house. A repository for all the God-King’s wealth.\nDOCTOR: No, I meant that it’s a giant floating bomb.\nHEFF: A what?\nNYSSA: That’s what the frescoes meant, about the God-King dying twice?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. When his tomb completes its journey, it explodes with enough power to create a new star. “Bringing light from the darkness”.\nVIRNA: It’s nowhere near completing its journey.\nDOCTOR: Then why has it powered up?\nVIRNA: You’re bluffing, trying to save your lives.\nHEFF: Maybe you should — [listen]\nVIRNA: (INTERRUPTING) Quiet!\nDOCTOR: If you won’t listen to me, listen to the ship. Put your ear to a wall. You’ll hear it for yourself. It’s powering up.\nVIRNA: As if I’d turn my back on— [you]\nHEFF: (RUSHING TO A WALL) Shh! (BEAT) I can hear it! He’s right! The ship is powering up.\nVIRNA: That doesn’t mean...\nNYSSA: Listen to your son! We have to get off this ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: If you want to die in a supernova-sized explosion... well, I can’t force you to save yourselves. But please, Nyssa and I would like to go.\nVIRNA: You killed my sons.\nDOCTOR: You have proof of that? Of course not.\nNYSSA: Someone else is coming!\nMURS: (ENTERING) Don’t shoot. Only me.\nVIRNA: Murs? What happened to you?\nMURS: Those insect things, they attacked us.\nHEFF: (REALISING) So where’s Hisko?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 32\nHISKO: What do you mean, choose to die? I don’t want to die!\nJHANNI: This is a tomb. You’ve no business being here if you didn’t come to die.\nHISKO: Please... I didn’t mean to do anything wrong. We came here because Mother told us about it... and then...\nJHANNI: Then your brothers began to die.\nHISKO: Please, don’t kill me.\nJHANNI: Don’t be stupid. I didn’t mean I was going to kill you. It’s the ship that’s going to kill you. It’s just a matter of when and how.\nHISKO: I just want to go back to my family. They’re all I’ve got. I don’t even care about the treasure! If you want it, you can have it.\nJHANNI: (ANGRY) Family. She’s leading you to your deaths. You follow her, I say you deserve it, too.\nHISKO: Please. Let me go.\nJHANNI: I’m not the one keeping you here. It’s the ship. It won’t let you leave. It’1ll kill you, and your mother will just stand by and let it!\nHISKO: Mother? She wouldn’t do that...\nJHANNI: Wouldn’t she? She— (IN PAIN) Nnnnnngh!\nHISKO: Are you okay? What’s wrong?\nJHANNI: (WITH DIFFICULTY, IN PAIN) The sacrifice. They’re here now. Go! Get off this ship, before it kills you. Before she lets it. Go!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 33\nJHANNI: (TO HERSELF) Go. Before it happens again...\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 34\nVIRNA: It’s them. They must have done something to Hisko.\nNYSSA: Except the Doctor and I been here the whole time.\nDOCTOR: Quite the feat, wouldn’t you agree?\nVIRNA: Heff — take Murs’ gun and look for your brother.\nHEFF: You heard what Murs said about those insect things.\nMURS: Lm alright. 1 -can- go.\nVIRNA: You’ve done enough, Murs. Heff — get moving.\nHEFF: And leave you to kill these two? No chance.\nVIRNA: Actually, I’m beginning to think they might be useful. They seem to know about this place.\nDOCTOR: I’ve told you, there’s no way we can stay on this ship.\nVIRNA: So you say. Or maybe you just want to get rid of us and keep the treasure for yourselves. You, and whoever else you’ve got in here helping you.\nNYSSA: This is ridiculous. The Doctor is trying to save your lives.\nHEFF: Mother, they’re telling the truth. They didn’t kill our brothers! And the ship really is powering up! How much longer do you want to [wait?!]\nHISKO: (BREATHLESS) I found you!\nVIRNA: There you are, boy!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR: The missing Hisko, I presume.\nNYSSA: (TO VIRNA) You see? — we didn’t kill him, after all.\nVIRNA: (ANNOYED, TO HISKO) What happened, boy? Where have you been all this time?\nHISKO: I was running from the insect things, then I ran into this — well, this woman.\nVIRNA: (INTERRUPTING) Woman? What woman?\nHISKO: I-I don’t know. Her face was mostly covered. She said.. she said we should leave.\nNYSSA: By the sounds of it, she had a point.\nVIRNA: What else did she say?\nHISKO: That the ship’s going to kill us all, unless we leave. That you’re going to let it, and.. I don’t know... a lot of crazy stuff. Something about a sacrifice...\nDOCTOR: Sacrifice?\nHISKO: That’s what she said — that the sacrifice was here now. (CONFUSED) Wait, who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, and this is Nyssa. We’re— [here by accident]\nVIRNA: (INTERRUPTING) They’re our prisoners. That’s who they are.\nJHANNI: (ON RADIO) Virna...? Virna!\nHEFF: Who’s that?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 36\nNYSSA: Hisko’s mystery woman, perhaps?\nVIRNA: I’1l deal with this. The three of you — keep an eye on our two friends here. (MOVES AWAY, SPEAKS TO RADIO, SOTTO) Who are you? What do you want?\nJHANNI: (ON RADIO) I told you, Virna. I told you to leave.\nVIRNA: Listen to me, whoever you are, I’1ll hunt you, and I’1l find you, and [then —]\nJHANNI: (ON RADIO, INTERRUPTING) You didn’t listen. So don’t say I didn’t warn you.\nHISKO: What was—\nMURS: Hisko! The prisoners!\nNYSSA: (RUNNING OFF) Doctor, hurry!\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) Stupid boys, you took your eyes off them!\nMURS: Mother, I’m sorry —\nVIRNA: I don’t want to hear it. Get after them! NOW!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Keep running, Nyssa! The TARDIS is just along this passageway!\nNYSSA: (STOPPING) No. No. Doctor, stop! — Stop!\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING, BACKTRACKING) Nyssa, you’re young, you’re fit, you shouldn’t need to [stop]\nNYSSA: It’s not that. Look — the photon switch on the wall? With your fingerprints in the dust all around it?\nDOCTOR: But that means —\nNYSSA: We’re here, Doctor. This is where the TARDIS was.

We’re trapped inside an ancient spaceship that’s already killed two of my brothers, probably, and now he tells us it’s actually a giant floating bomb that could explode any time?\nNYSSA: And if anyone can get us out of here alive, it’s the Doctor. (BEAT) I’m sorry about your brothers, though.\nHISKO: Thanks. Well, half-brothers, really. Mother — Virna — there’s two things she’s good at collecting. Husbands and treasures. Only she keeps the treasure a lot longer than she usually does the husbands.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 50\nNYSSA: How many of you are— were there?\nHISKO: Her children? I don’t really know. Five of us that came aboard here, and about another eight or so elsewhere that I know about for sure. After that...\nNYSSA: Your mother, how old is she?\nHISKO: Oh, I’m just about brave enough to follow her into places like this, but nowhere near enough to ever ask her that. “Not old enough or rich enough to retire yet”, that’s what she [always says. ]\nHISKO: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: (SUDDENLY STARTING UP) The God-King dies, and we mourn in the darkness left behind.\nHISKO: Hey, wait! That wasn’t me, I swear. I didn’t [touch anything. ]\nNYSSA: Ssssh! Listen!\nNYSSA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: They will come to Him, and offer their sacrifice.\nNYSSA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: They walk the path of trials and pain!\nNYSSA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: The greatest treasure is with the one who offers it to Him.\nNYSSA: “The path of trials and pain”? I’m not sure I like the sound of\nNYSSA: that.\nHISKO: Or the ‘sacrifices’ part. Maybe I should warn Mother.\nNYSSA: And the Doctor.\nHISKO: Well, they’re all together, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 51\nHISKO: (OVER STATIC) Hello? Mother? It’s me — Hisko. You receiving me? Hello? Heff? Murs? Anyone hearing me? (DEACTIVATES RADIO)\nNYSSA: Problems?\nHISKO: I don’t think they’re picking me up. Too much interference.\nNYSSA: Maybe it’s being caused by those things, when they started up again.\nHISKO: You could be right.\nNYSSA: I’ll see if I can find a way to switch them off. Why don’t you go over there? — Maybe you could get a better signal away from those things?\nHISKO: Good idea. (MOVES AWAY, ACTIVATES RADIO, HEAVY CRACKLE OF STATIC) Mother, it’s me — Hisko. You there?\nNYSSA: (OFF) Any luck?\nHISKO: Yes, it’s working! (TO RADIO) Hello? You receiving me? It’s Hisko. I’m here with the Doctor’s friend. No problems, but those hologram things have [started talking more —]\nHISKO: Hey! What are you doing? Stop! (TO RADIO) Mother! It’s the girl! She’s running away. I’m going after her. Hisko out! (RUNNING, CALLING OUT) Come back! I won’t be angry, honest!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 52\nMURS: You catch any of that?\nHEFF: It was definitely Hisko. Something about that girl?\nDOCTOR: He must mean Nyssa. If anything happens to her...\nVIRNA: I bring my family up to know how to behave properly. He’s a good boy, my Hisko. A bit naive, but a good boy. I told him to keep an eye on your friend, that’s what he’1ll do.\nMURS: Something up ahead. It looks like... wait, what is that?\nDOCTOR: Stay back. Don’t get too close.\nHEFF: It’s a body. Or part of one. See? There’s an arm, and — down there — what looks like part of a leg.\nMURS: They’re almost rotted away. Must have happened years ago.\nHEFF: You ask me, it looks he got melted right into the wall!\nDOCTOR: No, not melted...\nMURS: Then what?\nDOCTOR: That metal probe on your belt. Give it to me.\nMURS: What for?\nVIRNA: Do it, Murs.\nDOCTOR: Alright, stand back. I’m going to throw it onto the floor just im” £LOnt.-Of usc,\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR THROWS THE PROBE, IMPACT OF METAL ON STONE AS IT\nLANDS: )\nMURS: Okay. Now what?\nDOCTOR: Just wait...\nHEFF: It’s... gone.\nVIRNA: Vapourised?\nDOCTOR: More like teleported, I think.\nHEFF: Teleported? To where?\nDOCTOR: To a point about three feet to the left of where it was, I think.\nHEFF: Three feet? But that would put it...\nDOCTOR: Yes. Inside the wall.\nMURS: Wait, then this body here...\nDOCTOR: The remains of someone who triggered the trap and was partially teleported into the solid material of the wall.\nHEFF: Nasty. I wonder who they were.\nVIRNA: Someone who didn’t survive to find the treasure before us. That’s all I care about. We can’t go this way. The other way... (FX: TAKES A COUPLE STEPS) is a dead end. Looks like you took us the wrong way, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: Wait! Look at this junction point. There should be some more— yes, here they are. — Interesting. The sound symbols are mirror\nDOCTOR: images of each other. This one.. and this one.\nMURS: Meaning?\nDOCTOR: Meaning that if we go this way, we end up going that way.\nVIRNA: Make sense. Now.\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose anyone would care to volunteer...?\nVIRNA: Move it.\nMURS: Now what?\nHEFF: He’s gone!\nVIRNA: Idiot! He’s probably in the wall as well!\nHEFF: Hey! He’s in the opposite corridor!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Quite. It’s the only way past the trap. Walk the wrong way to take the right way. Ingenious, really.\nMURS: Let’s go!\nVIRNA AND DOCTOR: Wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 55\nVIRNA: Stupid boys! One at a time, if you want to get there in one piece.\nDOCTOR: She’s right. The teleport might splice you together.\nMURS: (PUSHING IN FRONT) I’m going first.\nMURS: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Haha! It works!\nVIRNA: Heff! We don’t have all day.\nHEFF: Hold on. There’s something else here — markings, scratched into the stone.\nVIRNA: Who cares? Move it.\nHEFF: I think that guy must have made them to mark his trail, just before he walked into that trap. Funny thing is, they look a lot like the ones we use.\nDOCTOR: Really? Now that is interesting.\nVIRNA: Lots of plunder crews use trail markers, Heff.\nHEFF: With the same kind of code signs we use? Thought they were Supposed to be an old family secret?\nVIRNA: Just get moving! (PUSHES HIM)\nVIRNA: (FX: HE STUMBLES FORWARD, THEN POWER-BUILD UP, VAPOURISATION BLAST)\nHEFF: (APPEARING) Ugh. You didn’t need to push me! I just thought it was interesting.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Yes. Very interesting...\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 56\nMURS: You hear that, Heff?\nHEFF: I did, yeah.\nDOCTOR: What was that, that sound?\nVIRNA: . Bugs. Great big insect things, the place is full of them. Alright, boys — go let off some steam.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 57\nHISKO: (RUNNING, CALLING OUT) Come back! Please! It isn’t safe in these tunnels!\nNYSSA: (OFF, RUNNING) No! I’ve got to find the Doctor and warn him what those holograms said!\nHISKO: (RUNNING, CALLING OUT) Then just stop, and we can do it together. I promise! My mother and brothers are in there too, remember? You think I don’t care about them?\nNYSSA: (OFF, RUNNING) How do I know I can trust you?\nHISKO: (RUNNING, CALLING OUT) Good question. Hmmm. Okay, wait. Just listen.\nHISKO: (STOPS RUNNING, CALLING OUT) There, you hear that? That was me throwing my blaster away, to prove I’m not a threat to you. That was a crazy thing to do, wasn’t it? Us all alone down here in a place as dangerous as this ship, and now I’m not even armed.\nNYSSA: (OFF, STOPS) Yes, I suppose it was.\nHISKO: (WALKING, CALLING OUT) Right. Now I’m walking toward a turn in the passage. You hear me coming? Don’t panic when you see me, okay?\nNYSSA: (OFF) I understand.\nHISKO: (WALKING, CALLING OUT) Okay, I’m coming round now. (BEAT, NO\nLONGER: CALLING OUT) There, you see? No blaster. Can I come closer?\nNYSSA: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 58\nHISKO: (WALKING TO HER) See? I’m not going to do anything. Hey, what do you say we start over, as if none of this had happened, only this time we— [SUDDEN SURPRISE] Oh.\nNYSSA: What’s the matter?\nHISKO: Listen, I don’t want to alarm you...\nNYSSA: Alarm me? You hold me hostage and chase me through these tunnels, but you don’t want to alarm me?\nHISKO: Behind you! There’s a dead body lying behind you!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 59\nMURS: (CALLING OUT, FIRING, OFF) Yeah, you like that? Not so much fun when there’s two of us and we’re ready for you, is it?\nHEFF: (CALLING OUT, FIRING, OFF) Murs! More of them, that opening to the left!\nMURS: (CALLING OUT, FIRING, OFF) Thanks, big brother. Hey, you see the way that one’s head flew right off?\nDOCTOR: Lovely boys. You must be so proud.\nVIRNA: They listen to their mother, always do what they’re told — well, one of them does, anyway — I can trust them.\nMURS: (CALLING OUT, OFF) Alright, they’re scarpering. You can come up now.\nVIRNA: See? Who needs recruits, when you’ve got family. Let’s go.\nDOCTOR: (FOLLOWING) Right behind you. Unfortunately.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 60\nHISKO: Watch it! Don’t get too close!\nNYSSA: To a dead body? What do you think it’1l do?\nHISKO: Well, you know... all the traps in this place...\nNYSSA: The Doctor and I found a body earlier, but this one’s different.\nHISKO: Really? How?\nNYSSA: This one’s much better preserved, for a start — (BREAKING OFF, IN DISGUST) Ugh, look at its hand!\nHISKO: It’s holding a plasma blaster. A nice one.\nNYSSA: No, the other one.\nHISKO: Oh, yuck. His fingers are worn away to the bone!\nNYSSA: And those scratch marks on the walls around it...\nHISKO: It looks like...\nNYSSA: Like he was trying to claw his way through stone with his bare hands! (BEAT) I don’t like this.\nHISKO: Neither do I. Let’s go back.\nHISKO: Uh-oh.\nNYSSA: What is that?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 61\nHISKO: They’re big, got too many legs and they bite. That’s all you need to know. Don’t worry — a few plasma blaster shots usually sends them packing.\nNYSSA: Except you threw your blaster away, remember?\nHISKO: Back there—\nNYSSA: Where the sound of those things is coming from.\nHISKO: The blaster that corpse is holding. It still looks usable.\nNYSSA: Hisko, no!\nHISKO: (MOVING) It’s alright. Just stand back, no point in us both— [risking our necks]\nHISKO: (MUFFLED, BANGING ON ENERGY SHIELD) Hey, what’s going on?\nNYSSA: It’s a trap! You’re caught inside a force field!\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) But you know how to get me out, right?\nNYSSA: I’m not sure. Maybe if I— [had more time]\nNYSSA: Those things, they’re coming!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 62\nVIRNA: See? My boys can take care of themselves.\nDOCTOR: (IN DISTASTE) That smell...\nMURS: Yeah, pong a bit when you fry them with hot plasma.\nHEFF: They’re all over the ship. What are they, anyway?\nVIRNA: Space parasites. Bit like the, what were they called? — Wirrn. I remember one time when I was salvaging this old asteroid mining platform, turned out to be full of Wirrn—\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) They’re Arrit-ko.\nHEFF: (INCREDULOUS) Arrit? You mean the things that built this ship?\nDOCTOR: No. Arrit-ko. It means ‘slaves of the Arrit’. Genetically engineered to live aboard this ship and serve its occupant.\nVIRNA: Occupant. You mean a corpse, in a tomb.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The Arrit god-king. They guard its tomb. Repel invaders. Carry out simple maintenance. Oh, and generally worship it.\nMURS: Worship?\nDOCTOR: The Arrit thought their kings were gods, even after they died. All alone and drifting through space for thousands of years? A god needs his worshippers—\nDOCTOR: —at least until it was time for the ship to go supernova and\nDOCTOR: transform a god-king into a god-star.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: Speaking of which...\nMURS: What is that?\nHEFF: Feels like retro-engines firing. Big ones.\nDOCTOR: That’s exactly what it is. Like it’s slowing down...\nDOCTOR: . and changing course. but why would it be doing that? (BEAT) Virna, when you found this thing, how deep into interstellar Space was it?\nVIRNA: Interstellar? No, we only detected it after it entered this system. Otherwise, we could have spent years more— [looking for ats\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) System! Which one? Not an inhabited one. Please tell me that.\nVIRNA: Does it matter?\nDOCTOR: Matter? A planetary system, possibly with inhabitants, and there’s a supernova bomb floating toward them? Yes, I'd say it matters.\nVIRNA: It’s one of the Vespertine Cluster systems. And, yes, it’s inhabited. That’s why we knew we had to get aboard fast, before any of the locals made a grab for it.\nDOCTOR: The tomb. We have to get to it as soon as possible.\nMURS: Isn’t that what we’ve been doing? That’s where the treasure is, right?\nDOCTOR: I don’t care about the treasure!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 64\nVIRNA: Good. More for us. I like the way you do business, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The control systems must be in there. That’s all I want to find.\nVIRNA: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because, if we can’t get off this ship before it explodes, then I need to try to get it back into deep space, to save every living thing in this star system. Is that alright with you?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 65\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Help me! Get me out of here!\nNYSSA: Hisko, you’ve got to stay calm. Look around you. Look for something that might release the force field.\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Like the corpse of the last person who died in it, you mean?!\nNYSSA: Those things are getting closer. Please, Hisko, you have to look!\nHISKO: I don’t see anything!\nNYSSA: Maybe it’s not a trap, maybe it’s saving you from thenm...\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Nyssa!\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Stupid empty pistol, small wonder you died! Nyssa, look out!\nNYSSA: No!\nJHANNI: (APPEARING) Arrit-Ko, tar-ka-rey! Rit-a! Nu-ji-rit-a!\nJHANNI: (FX: INSECTOID EXCITED FRENZY, CHANGES TO REPEATED CHANTING NOISE, AND RECEDES)\nNYSSA: (ALARMED) Who are you? How did you do that?!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 66\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) It’s her! The woman who took me prisoner!\nJHANNI: His name was Bress. He died here, alone and in the dark, left behind by those he trusted. (BEAT) I wonder what will happen to you.\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Hey, it’s me — Hisko. You let me go before, remember? I need some help here.\nJHANNI: I can’t help you.\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) You can’t just leave me here! Why save us and then leave me here?!\nJHANNI: Don’t you want to die like Bress did?\nNYSSA: Of course he doesn’t!\nJHANNI: So you wouldn’t sacrifice yourself? To save your family?\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) What?!\nJHANNI: Would you sacrifice yourself for them?\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED) Nyssa?\nJHANNI: (FIERCE) Answer!\nHISKO: (FORCE FIELD MUFFLED, UPSET) Yes! I’d do it. Just... make it quick!\nJHANNI: There. You’re free.\nHISKO: It’s gone!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 67\nNYSSA: I don’t understand.\nJHANNI: Why would you? Now, come with me.\nHISKO: Where?\nJHANNI: To the god-king. For a family reunion.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 68\nHEFF: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Ready, Heff?\nMURS: (SLIGHTLY OFF) If you are.\nVIRNA: No heroics, okay? (QUIETER, TO DOCTOR) You better be sure about this, Doctor. I’m risking the lives of my boys here.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure. See these holograph symbols on the walls that keep changing shape? They’re equations. The Arrit used them as a divine expression of the mathematical laws of nature, which they could then use to, well, break them. Gravity, light... all represented as symbols. Symbols we can [use]\nVIRNA: (INTERRUPTING, IMPATIENT) Doctor... we don’t need a maths lesson. Just point the way!\nDOCTOR: These symbols correspond to the patterns on the floor, showing safe routes across this chamber, following the footsteps of divine law.\nMURS: (CALLING OUT, SLIGHTLY OFF) He still going on...?\nDOCTOR: We have to wait for the holograms to shift to the right sequence, otherwise the whole room’s still a death trap!\nMURS: (CALLING OUT, SLIGHTLY OFF) What does that even mean?\nVIRNA: You do what he says, boys! He’s kept us alive this far.\nDOCTOR: Alright, they’re changing... Murs — two symbols forward, then three to the left. Go!\nMURS: (OFF, RUNNING) Watch this!\nDOCTOR: Heff — four forward, then one right. Go!\nHEFF: (INTERRUPTING, OFF, RUNNING) —four forward, one right. Made it!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CRASHES AND RUMBLES, ENERGY BLASTS AND FAST-MOVING\nMACHINERY: )\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Don’t stop! Keep following your patterns!\nVIRNA: (OVER NOISE) What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) The room, it’s trying to catch them. But they’1l be safe as long as they keep to the pattern I showed them.\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) To your right, Heff! Right!\nHEFF: (OFF, CALLING OUT, MOVING) I see it!\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Neo-Classic Arrit cuneiform, with a few Osirian\nDOCTOR: algorithms thrown in, just for fun. Very clever...\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) Faster, Murs! Keep moving!\nMURS: (OFF) That was close.\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) Keep going! (TO DOCTOR) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Almost... (HOLOGRAM SYMBOLS ACTIVATING) There!\nVIRNA: They did it. They’re at the door! It’s safe to go across now, yes?\nDOCTOR: It should be. The floor’s deactivated now, so— [there’s nothing that]\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: The seekers have passed the first trials.\nVIRNA: Seekers?\nDOCTOR: Sssh. Listen!\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: An offering must be made.\nVIRNA: You said it was s-[afe!]\nVIRNA: (FX: POWERFUL FORCE FIELD ACTIVATING. FROM HERE ON THEY’RE HELD IN A SORT OF ELECTRONIC BUBBLE)\nVIRNA: What... what is it.. (FX: ENERGY CRACKLING) Oooow!\nDOCTOR: Interesting. A force field’s sprung up around us. I wouldn’t advise touching the side of it.\nVIRNA: Easier said than done. — Look! My boys, they’re trapped too!\nDOCTOR: Why two force fields, I wonder? It’s not exactly an ecomonical use of the ship’s power reserves.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: An offering must be made. Choose.\nVIRNA: What... what does it mean? ‘Choose’?\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nVIRNA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You’re trying to get into the tomb of a god. Gods require sacrifices.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nDOCTOR: We have to choose. You and I, or your two sons — two of us have to die, for the other two to go free.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 72"

Gods require sacrifices.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nDOCTOR: We have to choose. You and I, or your two sons — two of us have to die, for the other two to go free.\nVIRNA: That can’t be what it means.\nDOCTOR: How long have you been on this ship, Virna? How many people have you lost? That’s exactly what it means.\nVIRNA: You did this. You said it was safe.\nDOCTOR: I’m as trapped as you are.\nVIRNA: Symbols, yet more of those holograms.\nDOCTOR: The one on the left is us. The one on the right is your sons.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR: Get back!\nVIRNA: The force field’s closing in! Do something, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: It’s stopping. For now.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nDOCTOR: I think that’s called a subtle incentive to act. (BEAT) Question is, what do we do now?\nVIRNA: Obvious, isn’t it? We choose.\nVIRNA: 73\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 74\nHEFF: . I told you, get back. You saw the burn it gave me.\nMURS: I’m trying to see Mother. Do you think she’s alright?\nHEFF: Mother? She’1ll be fine, Murs. Looking after number one, that’s what she’s best at.\nMURS: Wait... I can see her. What’s she doing?\nHEFF: She’s waving at us. There. She’s fine.\nMURS: What’s that in her hand?\nHEFF: Her radio. She wants to buzz us!\nMURS: Hold on...\nHEFF: There’s too much interference. Must be from this thing around\nHEFF: us.\nMURS: Quiet! I hear something...\nMURS: Hello, Mother? Yes... yes! I can hear you, just!\nMURS: I understand. Murs out. (SWITCHES OFF RADIO)\nHEFF: So? What did she say?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 75\nMURS: She said her and the Doctor are working to get us out of here. See? I knew she’d know what to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR: Are you going to lower your gun now?\nVIRNA: Kept you quiet, didn’t it?\nDOCTOR: What did you tell them that for? You heard me tell you there’s no way out, nothing I can do; no equations to solve!?\nVIRNA: They’re my boys. If I tell them everything’s going to be alright, then that’s what they’1ll believe. I haven’t much else to offer them but a mother’s words of comfort.\nDOCTOR: (IN DISBELIEF) Before you kill them?\nVIRNA: That’s what mothers do for their children. They pretend they’11l be fine; that when you’re there, nothing bad can happen. I’m just not the kind who actually believes it. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made. For the family.\nDOCTOR: You’d let them die?!\nVIRNA: Them or us, Doctor. Who do you think’s more important?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: NYSSA, HISKO, JHANNI CRAWLING ALONG NARROW PASSAGEWAYS, GRILLES ON FLOOR, OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF STEAM — NEW ATMOS)\nNYSSA: (CRAWLING) How did you do that before? You spoke to those things, and they understood you.\nJHANNI: (CRAWLING) Did I?\nNYSSA: (CRAWLING) Yes! You spoke to them in a language they understood. Don’t you remember?\nJHANNI: (CRAWLING) I...\nNYSSA: (STOPS) Wait! That sound. You hear it?\nHISKO: Yes. It sounds like... like... them!\nNYSSA: They’re down here with us.\nJHANNI: The Arrit-ko. They’ve lived in these tunnels for centuries.\nNYSSA: How? I mean, what do they live on?\nJHANNI: Each other. Unless some tasty tomb raider comes along. — We’re passing their main nesting hives.\nHISKO: I thought you brought us down here to get away from them!\nJHANNI: You’re safe here. They won’t get you, not if you stick close to me.\nNYSSA: They’re afraid of you, aren’t they? — That armour you’re wearing, it’s chitin shell. You’re wearing parts of their bodies.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: (TO JHANNI) Who are you? Do we get to know that?\nJHANNI: Jhanni. My name’s Jhanni.\nNYSSA: And you've been here surviving alone on this ship? For how long?\nJHANNI: Since I was left here to die.\nNYSSA: Left? By who?\nJHANNI: (SUDDENLY ALERT) There. Do you feel it?\nHISKO: Feel what?\nJHANNI: (BREAKING OFF, MOVING) Come on. We have to hurry.\nNYSSA: Why?\nJHANNI: The ship. It’s caught someone, and it’s about to kill them.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR: You can’t be serious. You’d sacrifice your own sons...?!\nVIRNA: I’ve lost two sons already since we came aboard, not to mention... (BREAKS OFF) .. well, never mind that now...\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nVIRNA: Think about it — we don’t choose, and they’1l die anyway. And if we choose them to escape instead of us, how long do you think they’1ll survive, without us to keep them alive? They’re as good as dead, no matter what.\nDOCTOR: Not if I’ve got anything to say about it.\nVIRNA: Like you’ve got a choice. I’m pressing that symbol.\nDOCTOR: Then you’1l have to get past me first.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 80\nMURS: What are they doing?\nHEFF: It looks like.. it looks like they’re fighting!\nMURS: Fighting against Mother? That Doctor must be a braver man than any of our dads!\nHEFF: There’s something not right here, Murs.\nMURS: The Doctor, I knew he wasn’t to be trusted.\nHEFF: I don’t know...\nMURS: Mother will sort him out.\nHEFF: It’s getting serious. She’s aiming her blaster at him now.\nMURS: Is she? Let me see! (BEAT) So she is. She won’t shoot him... will she?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 81\nVIRNA: Out of my way, Doctor. I will kill you. Don’t imagine I won't.\nDOCTOR: You'll have to, because it’s the only way you’1ll get past me to that symbol.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nVIRNA: I mean it.\nDOCTOR: And you think I don’t? You don’t know me at all.\nVIRNA: Last chance.\nDOCTOR: To survive at the cost of two other peoples’ lives? I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Choose.\nVIRNA: Your choice, Doctor... (ACTIVATES GUN)\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m rather afraid it is.\nVIRNA: What did you do?!\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: The offering has been made...\nVIRNA: (CONFUSED) What?\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: . and accepted.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR: You can put the gun away, Virna. The force field has been deactivated. — Yes, as has the one around Heff and Murs.\nMURS: (OFF, CALLING OUT) Mother!\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) Stay where you are and guard that door.\nHEFF: (OFF) What door?\nVIRNA: (CALLING OUT) The one that’s just opened up in front of you, idiot!\nDOCTOR: So it has.\nVIRNA: Seems like the Ship changed its mind about us.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I rather thought it might. This far in, the Ship doesn’t want to give access to the tomb to anyone willing to sacrifice others. It was someone devoted enough to sacrifice themselves. These ‘traps’, they’re more like tests...\nVIRNA: Whatever. — One moment. Before we rejoin my boys, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Ah. I presume you’d sooner I didn’t tell them that you were quite prepared to see them both dead, just to ensure your own survival?\nVIRNA: Not a word. Not if you ever want to see your friend Nyssa again.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 83\nJHANNI: (TO HERSELF) This is wrong.. to take them to the tomb. They haven’t walked the path of trials... Wrong... but it’s her fault! She did it. She made them come... She did it all.. (DIES AWAY INTO\nINAUDIBLE: MUTTERING)\nHISKO: (SOTTO) You hearing this?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Unfortunately, yes.\nHISKO: (SOTTO) Who’s she talking to?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Herself, I’m afraid.\nHISKO: (SOTTO) That’s not good, is it?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) No, it’s not.\nJHANNI: You two! What are you doing?\nNYSSA: You’re hurrying us too much, Jhanni, and we’re concerned about where you’re taking us.\nJHANNI: I told you. To the god-king’s tomb.\nNYSSA: But why? You haven’t told us that.\nJHANNI: Because that is where you need to go! You'll be.. safe... there.\nHISKO: (SOTTO) But that wasn’t what she said when she captured us.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) No, it wasn’t. Do you remember what she did say?\nHISKO: (SOTTO) Something about... a family reunion? What did she mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 84\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) You want to ask her?\nJHANNI: (TO HERSELF) The tomb, it’s forbidden, but she’ll be there! She has to pay..! (DIES AWAY INTO INAUDIBLE MUTTERING)\nHISKO: (SOTTO) No, not really. Do you know what it means?\nNYSSA: I think I might. (BEAT) Hisko, do you have any sisters?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: HOLOGRAM-FRESCOES :\nDOCTOR WHO: —and the god-king did weep, for no other in a thousand thousand worlds could match the beauty or wisdom of his lost wife—\nDOCTOR WHO: —was cast down, their statues and idols destroyed, and all forbidden forever afterward to even utter their cursed name—\nDOCTOR WHO: —her enemies scattered, their worlds burned to ash, her son’s death at last avenged—\nDOCTOR WHO: —rejoiced, for they would ever know that the god-king would still be with them, looking down upon them from his place among his brothers and sisters in the night skies—\nDOCTOR WHO: —plagues and torments, so that at last they sent emissaries to the god-king, to beg for his divine forgiveness—\nDOCTOR WHO: —an army of mighty war machines that shook mountains to their roots, split asunder the ground beneath their wheels and cast terror into the hearts of all who beheld them—\nHEFF: Wow, look at the size of this place! Those columns must be a couple of hundred feet high!\nVIRNA: Doctor — do something about the talking wallpaper.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the entire history of an ancient race, here for us to access through these hologram records.\nMURS: Does he ever shut up?\nDOCTOR: Some people would say this was one of the greatest treasures they could ever hope to find. But not you, Virna.\nMURS: Yap yap yap. Just shut up and do what Mother says, professor.\nDOCTOR: I mean, you’re not interested in any of that, are you? Just in what you can loot.\nMURS: I’m warning you... (ACTIVATES GUN)\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 86\nVIRNA: (ANGRILY) Murs! Put that weapon away. (GUN DEACTIVATES) Good boy. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Very well.. (ACTIVATES HOLOGRAM CONTROLS) There.\nVIRNA: Murs — take your brother and scout around.\nMURS: For what?\nVIRNA: Anything that’s going to stop the two of you getting on my nerves. Go!\nDOCTOR: Real chip off the block, that one. If only he knew just how loyal his mother is to him in return.\nVIRNA: (WARNING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, your secret’s safe, but there’s a few things I need to know.\nVIRNA: And what would that be?\nDOCTOR: You’ve been on this ship before, haven’t you? Tell me, how many children did it cost you, and how far did you get?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 87\nJHANNI: Stop. Wait here. I’1ll check the way ahead.\nNYSSA: You’re leaving us alone? Here?\nJHANNI: There’s Arrit-ko nests all in the tunnels all around us. You’re safer here than trying to escape and finding one of them.\nHISKO: What if they find us?\nJHANNI: (LEAVING) Then I’1l hear you screaming, and hopefully return in time to save you.\nHISKO: Okay, I think she’s gone. What did you mean, do I have any sisters?\nNYSSA: Jhanni — you can’t think of anyone she reminds you of?\nHISKO: Crazy, paranoid, possible homicidal tendencies — no, should I?\nNYSSA: Listen, remember I told you the Doctor and I found a body earlier on?\nHISKO: Yes, and we found that other that had been caught in that trap!\nNYSSA: There’s been another expedition here before. With the same kind of equipment your family uses...\nHISKO: Jhanni got... left behind by another expedition? Is that what you’re saying?\nNYSSA: And who do you suppose was leading that expedition?\nHISKO: How should I know?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 88\nNYSSA: I think it was your mother.\nHISKO: What! That’s crazy.\nNYSSA: She’s been looking for this ship for decades. I think this isn’t the first time she’s found it.\nHISKO: Yes, but Mother never involves outsiders in family business. She only ever uses... (REALISES) Oh.\nNYSSA: Exactly. The corpse with the same equipment? Jhanni talking about a ‘family reunion’?\nHISKO: My sister?\nNYSSA: Half-sister, at least. I think she came here as part of your mother’s last expedition, got left behind when the ship killed most of them, and has managed to stay alive, waiting for your mother to come back.\nHISKO: But why?\nNYSSA: Why do you— [think]\nHISKO: (SOTTO, INTERRUPTING) Ssssh! She’s coming back.\nJHANNI: Something’s got the Arrit-ko stirred up. We have to get out of this area. This way — come with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 89\nHEFF: (CALLING OUT) Nothing here. You got anything?\nMURS: (OFF, CALLING OUT) Nothing. Let’s try the other side.\nMURS: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO:\nMURS: —and it was in the fiftieth year of his reign that the god-king Aruk-Ayun did look out upon the many worlds under his divine rule, and command that a mighty army be assembled from all their peoples— (THROUGH: )\nHEFF: (OVER HOLOGRAM) I wish those things would stop doing that.\nMURS: (OVER HOLOGRAM) Hold on. I saw what the Doctor does with these.\nMURS: See? That Doctor’s tricks aren’t so impressive.\nHEFF: I don’t know. He’s kept us alive this far, hasn’t he?\nMURS: Only because Mother’s got him.. Hey, you hear something?\nHEFF: Yeah, from over there.\nMURS: And over here!\nHEFF: They’re coming from all over!\nMURS: Heff£? (ACTIVATES GUN)\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 90\nHEFF: Good idea. (ACTIVATES GUN)\nMURS: Let ‘em have it.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 91\nVIRNA: How did you know?\nDOCTOR: That you’d been here before? Because you left a trail of your dead children behind you, just like you seem to be doing this time.\nVIRNA: I care about my children. Don’t for a second think I don’t.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’ve seen the way that works.\nVIRNA: Being a mother means making some tough calls sometimes. All those hungry mouths to feed, all of them looking to me to provide. With what’s in that tomb, I’1l be able to look after my family long after I’m gone. That’s why we’re here.\nDOCTOR: But these traps, Virna. They feel... more like tests than defences.\nVIRNA: So? You seem to be good enough at dealing with them.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and that’s what worries me. And then there’s the way the ship’s behaving, entering an inhabited system. That’s not the way the Arrit— (BREAKS OFF)\nVIRNA: What is it? What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: Ssssh. Can’t you feel it?\nVIRNA: Feel what?\nDOCTOR: The ship, it’s slowing down. — Yes, it’s stopping!\nVIRNA: That’s not going to be good, is it?\nDOCTOR: What do you think?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 92\nVIRNA: (ACTIVATES RADIO) Heff, Murs? You reading me? I want you back here. N-[ow. ]\nVIRNA: (FX: SHOUTS, ENERGY PISTOL FIRE, INSECTOID NOISES OFF, COMING CLOSER)\nDOCTOR: No need. I think they’re on their way.\nHEFF: (OFF, CALLING OUT) Move! They’re right behind us!\nVIRNA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This way!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 93\nNYSSA: Thanks goodness. At last, we can stand.\nHISKO: Up ahead...\nJHANNI: Keep going. No talking.\nHISKO: Yes, but— [there’s a]\nJHANNI: Keep going!\nNYSSA: (FORCEFUL, STOPS WALKING) What Hisko is trying to tell you is that (RAISES VOICE WHICH ECHOES) there’s rather a large and very deep hole right in front of us.\nJHANNI: Damn!\nHISKO: The other side must be almost ten metres across. There’s no way we can make it.\nNYSSA: It’s new. The stone is still crumbling away at the edges.\nHISKO: Then what made it?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. It’s an old ship. Very old. Maybe stress on its structure from the engines reactivating after so long...\nJHANNI: No way across. We’1ll have to... (BREAKS OFF)\nHISKO: Hear that?\nNYSSA: Those things — the Arrit-ko — they’re coming!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 94\nHISKO: Yes, from behind us. There’s no other way out of here. We’re trapped!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR, VIRNA, HEFF, MURS, ALL RUNNING.

Come on!\nDOCTOR: It’s locked.\nVIRNA: Then open it.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR: It’ll take time. Time we don’t seem to have!\nVIRNA: Boys...\nHEFF: (FIRING GUN) Just so you know, I’ve only got two minutes of juice left in this thing on rapid fire setting.\nMURS: (FIRING GUN) Want to swap? I’ve got about a minute in mine.\nVIRNA: There you are, Doctor. You wanted time, that’s how much you’ve got. Now get busy.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 97\nHISKO: Here they come! Do something!\nJHANNI: Like what?\nHISKO: You’ve got a blaster, haven’t you?\nJHANNI: This thing? The charge ran out years ago.\nHISKO: You've been threatening us with it all this time, and—- Oh, never mind...\nNYSSA: (GRABBING HISKO) Look out!\nHISKO: They’re right on top of us! They’re— They're... (PUZZLED)... passing us right by?\nJHANNI: Keep back! Stay against the wall! Let them pass by.\nHISKO: Look! They’re massing right at the edge of the chasm! (IN DISBELIEF) What are they doing? Throwing themselves over?\nNYSSA: No! Look — they’re not falling. They are linking their bodies together. They’re.. building a chain reaching out across the chasm!\nHISKO: Why? Why are they doing it? Why aren’t they attacking us?\nNYSSA: Let’s ask an expert, shall we?\nJHANNI: I don’t know. I’ve never seen them behave like this before.\nNYSSA: A bridge. They’re forming a bridge!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 98\nHISKO: Nyssa, where are you going?\nNYSSA: We needed a way across that chasm, and now we’ve got one. Come\nNYSSA: on!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 99\nHEFF: A minute’s charge left! You?\nMURS: Thirty seconds. Still want to swap?\nVIRNA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (RAPIDLY PRESSING HOLOGRAM CONTROLS) There’s a problem.\nVIRNA: Look behind you. There’s about five hundred problems, all of them with flesh-eating mandibles.\nDOCTOR: This cypher, it’s taking longer than I thought to crack it.\nMURS: Twenty seconds charge left.\nVIRNA: Clock’s ticking, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hold on... hold on... (HOLOGRAM ACTIVATES) There. That’s it done.\nMURS: It’s opening!\nVIRNA: But not fast enough. Murs — with me. Heff — you still got any charge left in your pistol?\nHEFF: Some.\nVIRNA: Then hold position and keep firing. Keep them away from us for as long as you can! When I give the word, fall back toward us.

Never thought I’d be using them as a bridge.\nNYSSA: Just keep going, and don’t look down. Or think about what you’re climbing across.\nHISKO: Easier said than done. I can feel them moving beneath my feet, and that noise they’re making...\nNYSSA: Well, just be glad they’re there. We can ask ourselves why when we’re safely across.\nHISKO: What’s that?\nJHANNI: An explosion.\nNYSSA: Another one. It sounds like something hitting the hull.\nHISKO: And they’re getting bigger.\nJHANNI: Go faster!\nNYSSA: Almost across!\nNYSSA: Quickly!

A miles-long unknown alien ship was eventually going to provoke a reaction.\nDOCTOR: They’re using heavy energy batteries.\nVIRNA: The ship’s carved out of solid Arrit god-stone. It’1ll take them hours to make a crack in it, and we’ll be long gone by then.\nDOCTOR: We have to warn them! They have to get away from this ship before it explodes.\nVIRNA: Of course. As soon as we're safely out of here. Along with the treasure I came for.\nMURS: Aren’t you forgetting something? What about Heff! We left him with those things!\nVIRNA: It was for the family, Murs.

The traps are a.. a.. proof of worth! Not just of intellect, logic or strength. The most important trait is the willingness to face death, tests which can only be solved by putting yourself at risk. By offering your life for others.\nMURS: Great. I’m trapped in a treasure vault, about to go up ina supernova explosion and all I’ve got for company is a lunatic and a dead god.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. (MOVES ACROSS ROOM)\nMURS: What do you mean ‘perhaps’? — Where are you going? I asked you a question, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Just taking a closer look at this throne.

What in all the stars are you doing here?\nHANNAH: Mr Tremayne described to me the Doctor’s incredible machine, his cabinet that travels in time and space. I regret to say, I gave in gladly to the temptation.\nNYSSA: You broke into the TARDIS-?!\nHANNAH: I’m no common burglar! — No, the door was left open, and so...\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 123\nNYSSA: Don’t be absurd, the Doctor would never leave the door — [open] (GROANS, REMEMBERING) The catch on the door, he said it was sticking.\nHANNAH: Blow me if the thing ain’t of a greater extent within than without. Lost my way wanderin’ around, and by the time I found my way back to the way I came in — well, it seemed the pair of you had been and gone.\nNYSSA: This is terrible.\nHANNAH: I’ll say. Well, suddenly the machine made the most awful trumpeting — I promise you, I’d not touched a thing. Then, not long after, the doors opened of their own accord, and, well, I was here... in whatever quarter of hell this is.\nNYSSA: It’s a tomb.\nHANNAH: Egypt, is it? Was hopin’ to have gone a little further afield. Still, explains these here crickets.\nNYSSA: No, we’re not in Egypt, Miss Bartholomew. And the TARDIS does not move of its own accord. At least, not so far as I’m aware. (SIGH) I think we’d better find the Doctor, before you cause any more trouble.\nHANNAH: Trouble? — I just saved your life, m’lady!\nNYSSA: Yes, and I’m grateful. After I lost track of Hisko —\nHANNAH: (INTERRUPTING) Hisko! Yes!\nNYSSA: You’ve seen him?\nHANNAH: No, but I met a wretched fellow named Heff, who spoke his name to me. Had to save him from the insects, too — well, me and this huntin’ rifle I borrowed from Whitlock’s armoury. Glad I thought to stock up on ammo now, it’s nearly all gone.\nNYSSA: Yes, yes, but Heff! What did he say?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 124\nHANNAH: Not a lot, in between all the gurgles and wheezes and choking on blood. But he did say something about stopping his mother\nHANNAH: from trying to kill his brothers — a Murs, and this [Hisko?]\nNYSSA: That sounds like him now.\nHANNAH: Then let’s dally here no longer. Seems I’ve another lost lamb\nHANNAH: to rescue!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 125\nVIRNA: (FIRING GUN) You thought my boys were bad news?

I lost it...\nVIRNA: (FIRING GUN) And your prisoner too, I see. Well, not that we need her now, anyway.\nHISKO: Mother, where’s Heff? And Murs?\nVIRNA: Later. Here, take this blaster.

(TO GOD-KING) No, you won’t allow your means to true immortality to be destroyed before you’re ready, will you?\nMURS: Who are you talking to?\nDOCTOR: (TO GOD-KING) And you are ready, aren’t you? You’ve been waiting for this for millennia, so what are you waiting for now?\nMURS: It can’t hear you. It’s dead!\nDOCTOR: Ah, but is it? There’s a living mind controlling this ship, but it’s not behaving as it should. It’s taken the ship out of deep space, where it was intended to explode, and into a planetary system. Why?\nMURS: You think it’s still alive?\nDOCTOR: Give me a hand.\nMURS: Oh, no. I’m not going anywhere near that thing.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING ON THRONE) I just need to get up on the throne and see.. Yes, there it is and it connects to.. ah, yes.\nMURS: That crown thing?\nDOCTOR: It’s not a crown, it’s a psychic amplifier, and it’s probably keeping the brain — well — if not alive, then certainly active.\nMURS: Active? You sure you should be messing about with it?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR: (JUMPS DOWN) I need to, if I’m going to talk to it.\nMURS: Talk to it? I’m not sure about this.\nDOCTOR: How else am I going to persuade it to change course and not explode?\nMURS: What?\nDOCTOR: This is how they create their god stars. Some willing and worthy sacrifice — in this case, unfortunately, me — links themselves up to that altar, and the two linked minds — mine and the Arrit’s — create the trigger that detonates the supernova explosion.\nMURS: That’s insane! Why would anyone do that?\nDOCTOR: Because you get to be a god too, your mind joined with it when it becomes a living star. That’s the prize those that find the ships are promised. That’s the ‘treasure’ your mother thought\nDOCTOR: was here.\nMURS: There’s no treasure? No. But... my brothers... Rek.. Biss... Heff...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m sorry. Victims of your mother’s obsession and some long-ago mis-translation of the word ‘prize’.\nMURS: Nothing... It’s all been for nothing...\nDOCTOR: Not if I can stop this thing from exploding and killing everyone in this star system. Now, help me up on this altar, and get ready to hold me down...\nMURS: Why? What’s going to happen?\nDOCTOR: Well, if I can’t link with it and try to persuade it not to explode, there’s every reasonable chance it’1ll get angry.\nMURS: It’s going to shout at you in your head?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: No. It’ll probably try to kill me.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 131\nNYSSA: (ENTERING WITH HANNAH) Hisko!

Oh, Doctor — what have you done?\nDOCTOR: (IN PAIN) Nyssa? .. Help me!\nNYSSA: Murs — Help me up there, I have to get this thing off him. Hisko, catch him when he falls.\nMURS: He said not to move him, no matter what happened.\nNYSSA: Was that before or after it started killing him? — Are you ready, Hisko? After three. One, two, three —\nHISKO: (STAGGERS UNDER DOCTOR’S WEIGHT) Got you!\nNYSSA: Set him down here. (FX: SETTING-DOWN BUSINESS) — Doctor? — Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (WEAKLY) Nyssa? I’m sorry, Nyssa. I failed. The God-King, his mind is full of such... such rage...\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL)\nNYSSA: I don’t understand.\nHISKO: That thing on throne — it’s still alive?\nMURS: That’s what he said.\nDOCTOR: I tried to link my mind to the God-King’s. But there was\nDOCTOR: another mind in there already.\nNYSSA: Another mind? Whose mind? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: A mind full of rage. A desire for destruction. No, not destruction. Revenge. There was no room in there for me, not with all that... shouting over the top. I don’t suppose I’m\nDOCTOR: making very much sense, am I?\nNYSSA: Oh, you are. Perfect sense.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean? Nyssa?\nNYSSA: There was someone else aboard this\nNYSSA: arrived. Virna’s daughter, Jhanni.\nMURS: Who did you say?\nDOCTOR: (TO NYSSA) Go on.\nNYSSA: ship before any of us\nNYSSA: She was left behind on Virna’s last expedition. She’s been\nNYSSA: for who-knows-how-many years.\nDOCTOR: I see. And now all she wants is to revenge herself on her\nDOCTOR: mother.\nHISKO: She’s about to get it, I think.\nHISKO: Page 133\nHISKO: here\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: What do you mean? This Jhanni, where is she?\nHISKO: Up above, with Virna. They were fighting when I left...\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP) We have to find her. Stop her!\nMURS: Let her die. That’s what I say.\nDOCTOR: No. You don’t understand! If she succeeds in killing Virna, then there’s nothing left to stop the ship going supernova!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 135\nJHANNI: You left me here to die. (THROWS PUNCH)\nVIRNA: (DODGING) Didn’t make a good job of it then, did I? You look pretty alive to me. (LAUNCHES KICK)\nJHANNI: (GETTING UP) That the best you can do, Mother?\nVIRNA: Look at you. The runt of the litter. No wonder I left you behind.\nJHANNI: Oh, I’ve learned a lot in my time here. Let me show you. (ATTACKS VIRNA) Remember Brui? The Arrit-ko tore him to shreds.\nJHANNI: Or Tirro? You should have heard his screams as that airlock trap flushed him out into space.\nJHANNI: Do you remember them? Or what they even looked like?\nVIRNA: (GETTING UP) I only remember the ones who don’t fail me. The years have toughened you up, girl. Let’s see what else you think you’ve learned. (ATTACKS)\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 136\nHISKO: (CLIMBING UP OUT OF HOLE) Almost there. (EFFORT) I’m out.\nNYSSA: (CLIMBING ROPE) Right behind you. Doctor, you alright?\nHANNAH: Here, let me help. (PULLS DOCTOR UP) Ups-a-daisy.\nDOCTOR: (OBLIVIOUS) Thank-you, Miss Barth-[olomew]. (CONFUSED) Wait... what are you doing here?\nNYSSA: It’s a long story. (CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE)\nDOCTOR: Yes, [but —]\nNYSSA: Not now, Doctor! — Hannah, help Murs.\nHANNAH: (TO MURS) You next, young shaver.\nNYSSA: Doctor: we saw Jhanni controlling those insects. But does that mean she can control the ship as well?\nDOCTOR: Well, the ship, the Arrit-ko, they’re all controlled by the same psychic matrix. Jhanni’s been here so long, and her emotions are so strong, that she’s become part of it. She might not even know she’s linked to it.\nNYSSA: If she’s joined with the God-King’s mind, why hasn’t the ship exploded?\nDOCTOR: Jhanni’s bloodlust has steered the ship to a place where it can kill millions of people. The only reason it hasn’t exploded is because her thirst for revenge isn’t sated. There’s something she still needs to do...\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 137\nMURS: Kill the mother who betrayed her.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 138\nVIRNA: (FIGHTING) You think I don’t remember you? A pathetic mewling girl. And now look at you. Strong. Capable.\nJHANNI: And good enough to take you with my bare hands. (KNOCKS VIRNA TO THE GROUND)\nVIRNA: (STUNNED) Uuuugh!\nJHANNI: (FX: SCRABBLING AROUND FOR MANDIBLE) But the killing blow — that’s a job for something sharper. (GETS MANDIBLE) Something with bite!\nVIRNA: You blame me, when you should be thanking me. Getting left behind here was the best thing that ever happened to you. Look at you! How strong you’ve become.\nJHANNI: Shut up, Mother. Just die. (RAISES MANDIBLE...)\nHISKO: (FX: RUNNING IN FROM OFF) Jhanni, no!\nHISKO: Don’t kill her! You mustn’t kill her!\nMURS: Shut up, Hisko. (TO JHANNI) Do it, sister — if that’s what you are.\nNYSSA: No — Hisko’s right! Kill her, and we all die.\nJHANNI: What does that matter to me?\nDOCTOR: Jhanni. I’m the Doctor. I don’t know you, but I know you don’t want to kill anyone.\nHANNAH: (ASIDE) I don’t know the gel either, but I wouldn’t be so sure.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: Ms Bartholomew, please! — (TO JHANNI) You’ve already saved the lives of your brother here, and my friend Nyssa. If you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have done that.\nJHANNI: She deserves it.\nDOCTOR: But the others here don’t.\nDOCTOR: And neither do the people outside. They’re attacking this ship, because it’s a threat. They’re just trying to survive, just like you did here for all these years.\nHISKO: Listen to him, Jhanni.\nDOCTOR: A terrible thing was done to you, but it’s not the fault of any of these others. I can save them all, but I need your help to do that. Starting with not doing anything to harm Virna.\nJHANNI: (UNSURE) I...\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Put the knife down.\nNYSSA: Mandible.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Nyssa. — (TO JHANNI) Now, please — let her go, [ and—]\nVIRNA: (BREAKING FREE) I was wrong — you’re still pathetic. (HITS\nJHANNT: )\nJHANNI: (STUNNED) Uuuugh!\nHANNAH: Mind, she’s going for that pistol!\nHISKO: (MOVING) Mother! No!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 140\nVIRNA: (ACTIVATES GUN) Out of my line of fire, boy!\nHISKO: i\nVIRNA: Idiot!\nHISKO: (SHOT, FALLS) Aaagh!\nNYSSA: Hisko!\nHANNAH: He’1l live.\nVIRNA: The rest of you — keep back!\nMURS: NO! That’s the last one, Mother! The last one of your children you get to kill! (CHARGES)\nVIRNA: Keep back, I said! (FIRES GUN)\nMURS: (SHOT DEAD) Aaagh!\nVIRNA: I warned him. You all heard me! The rest of you, follow me, and I’1l make you regret it! (RUNS OFF)\nHISKO: (STARTING TO FOLLOW) Mother! Wait!\nHANNAH: You stop right there, young man! — I promised your dying brother that I’d make sure she didn’t harm you. So if you go after her, I swear I’ll shoot you myself. (RAISES RIFLE)\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Hannah. Hisko. There’s been enough deaths in this family today. Don’t follow her and add to them.\nHISKO: (INJURED, UPSET) Murs... Heff...?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: I know. I’m sorry.\nNYSSA: He’s hurt, let me look. (CHECKING HISKO)\nJHANNI: Well?\nNYSSA: It’s a nasty burn, but he’1l live.\nHANNAH: Page 141\nHANNAH: As long as the rest of us, at least. Which may not be long.\nJHANNI: My brother. He saved my life.\nDOCTOR: Yes, he did. That’s what families do for each other.\nJHANNI: You said I could save everyone. Tell me what I have to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 142\nVIRNA: (ON THE MOVE, SEARCHING ABOUT) Is this it? Is this the way they came from? I knew they’d found it. Keeping secrets from me — their own mother! — You bring them into this world, raise them, try to teach them what they need to know to survive, then they sell you out to a bunch of outsiders. Well, I know what to do with disobedient [children]\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Do not deny His wrath!\nVIRNA: Not that way. See, Doctor? You’re not the only one that can navigate this place. (MOVES ON, SEARCHING) It’s in here somewhere. My prize. No outsider or unworthy brat is going to deny me what’s mine. This way...\nVIRNA: Keep on blasting away, boys. You think this thing’s been floating in space all this time, just for you to blow up?\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Throwing themselves to the ground, they come before his blessed presence.\nVIRNA: Throw myself through the floor? Is that what it takes? Alright, then — I will! (LEAPS THROUGH FLOOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR: The bombardment’s getting heavier. Not even an Arrit ship can take much more of this.\nNYSSA: (AGREEING) No.\nHANNAH: Dash it all, we need to get out of here!\nDOCTOR: Ms Bartholomew. I’m presuming you stowed away in my TARDIS?\nHANNAH: Well, yes, but if you’re looking to give me a scolding —\nDOCTOR: No time. The point is, you know where my TARDIS went to, after the HADS kicked in?\nHANNAH: The what?\nDOCTOR: Hostile Action Displacement System. An automatic protection mechanism. I daresay when the walls moved, the TARDIS thought she was about to fall into a trap of some description.\nHANNAH: ‘Thought’?\nNYSSA: Either that, or it just wanted to get far away from the deranged woman with the rifle.\nDOCTOR: Oh! Yes, possibly. — (HURRIEDLY) Not that you’re deranged, Ms Bartholomew, merely... unpredictable. The point is, it would be enormously helpful if you were to lead us to it, without delay.\nHANNAH: I can do that.\nNYSSA: We're leaving?\nHISKO: But what about the explosion? The supernova?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: Yes, I hadn’t forgotten. Jhanni...\nJHANNI: You were right, Doctor. (TELEPATHY) The ship, that thing in the tomb, I can feel them, in my mind...\nDOCTOR: Then concentrate. Separate the different parts, tell me what you find.\nHISKO: That’s the hull starting to go.\nJHANNI: (TELEPATHY) The engines! I can feel them! Massive. Powerful. So very powerful...\nDOCTOR: The navigation systems, Jhanni. What about the navigation\nDOCTOR: systems?\nJHANNI: They’re frozen. Locked.\nDOCTOR: You locked them, steering the ship here. You can unlock them.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nHISKO: They’1l be through any second!\nJHANNI: (TELEPATHY) I.. I can!!!\nHISKO: They’ve cracked open the hull! They’1l rip us apart!\nNYSSA: No, that’s not weapons fire.\nHISKO: Engines! We’re moving!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: And fast, faster than they can catch us. Heading?\nJHANNI: Deep space. Away from this system.\nDOCTOR: Good job.\nHANNAH: Not that I know much about such things... but that doesn’t sound good.\nJHANNI: (TELEPATHY) No! He knows! He’s waited so long. He... he’s going to... no!\nDOCTOR: The explosion. Oh no.\nJHANNI: (TELEPATHY) It’s starting now! Power building up in the generators... Another mind in the matrix.. He’s making me, I can’t stop it!\nDOCTOR: Hisko — radio, now! The rest of you — run!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 146\nVIRNA: (SHOUTING) Where is it? All this time looking, everything it’s cost me! It has to be here! Where is it?\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: (ACTIVATING) Death has drawn you here...\nVIRNA: (ACTIVATING PISTOL) Enough!\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESO: Offer your gift. Claim your prize. Bring eternal light from the darkness!\nVIRNA: (FIRING GUN) I said ENOUGH!\nVIRNA: (FX: ENERGY BLASTER FIRE HITTING WALLS, DESTROYING HOLOGRAM,\nRICHOCHETING: )\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING, ON RADIO) Virna? Are you there?\nVIRNA: Where is it, Doctor? Where’s my treasure?\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING, ON RADIO) You hear that? That’s the generators getting ready to go supernova. You need to get out of here with the rest of us.\nVIRNA: Where is it? What have you done with it?\nDOCTOR: (ON RADIO) There is no treasure. If your life’s ambition is to become a living star, then — congratulations — you’re about to achieve it, in just a few minutes’ time.\nVIRNA: You’re lying. You’ve taken it already, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED, ON RADIO) Yes, yes, I have. I’1l share it with you, as soon as we’re safely off this ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 147\nVIRNA: Oh no. It’s still in here. You’re just trying to trick me!\nDOCTOR: (ON RADIO) Please, Virna...\nVIRNA: No! It’s here somewhere. It must be!\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 148\nVIRNA: (ON RADIO) I’ve come too far, sacrificed too much for it not to be!\nNYSSA: Doctor, we can’t wait!\nHANNAH: Inside your strange vessel, sir! Now!\nDOCTOR: (ON RADIO) Sacrifice. Yes, and a pointless one too. (ENDS\nCOMMUNICATION: )\nCOMMUNICATION: (FX: ENTERS TARDIS, BANGS DOOR SHUT. DOESN’T QUITE CATCH. BEAT, THEN BANGS DOOR SHUT PROPERLY. TARDIS DEMATERIALISES. CROSS\nTO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 149\nVIRNA: (MAD) Where is it? Where is it? Where-?!?\nVIRNA: HOLOGRAM-FRESCO: Death has drawn [you]\nVIRNA: (FX: THE SHIP GOES SUPERNOVA. HUGE EXPLOSION EFFECT, DECAYING TO SILENCE)\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 150\nNYSSA: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: A half-light year away from our last position. Safe viewing distance.\nHANNAH: Viewing? Viewing what?\nNYSSA: Up there, we call that the scanner.\nHANNAH: That? A window into night?\nNYSSA: Oh! — Doctor, it’s broken.\nDOCTOR: Just watch.\nNYSSA: There’s nothing there. Just empty space— (SUDDENLY REACTING) Oh!\nHANNAH: So bright!\nDOCTOR: Yes, you might want to shade your eyes.\nNYSSA: That’s it, isn’t it? The moment the Arrit tomb ship went supernova.\nHANNAH: It’s beautiful. But it feels sad, somehow.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It didn’t seem appropriate, to show this to Jhanni and Hisko. But I thought, since we’ve dropped them off — well, a new star being born. That’s not something you see every day.\nHANNAH: No, it is not.\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: A new Arrit god-star, taking its place with the others.\nNYSSA: You believe all that?\nDOCTOR: No, but the Arrit did, and look what it inspired them to create. Light from the darkness.\nNYSSA: Jhanni and Hisko, Doctor — do you think they’1l be alright?\nDOCTOR: They’re family. They’1ll look after each other, I hope.\nHANNAH: Doctor, Miss Nyssa — let us dwell on this sorry affair no longer. There are many other wonders in the universe, are there not?\nDOCTOR: (GUARDED) There are, yes.\nHANNAH: Well, then — let us visit them! Let us make the most of our moment in Time’s limelight!\nNYSSA: Forgive me, Miss Bartholomew — but I don’t recall your being invited aboard the TARDIS.\nHANNAH: I presume, of course. Just as I presumed to save you from the snapping, salivating jaws of those devilish insects, Miss Nyssa — eh, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s true, Ms Bartholomew — Hannah — we owe you our thanks. Don’t we, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Thank you, Ms Bartholomew.\nDOCTOR: But what you suggest is entirely out of the question —\nHANNAH: What-?\nDOCTOR WHO: TOMB SHIP by Gordon Rennie & Emma Beeby (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: — if you persist in waving that rifle around, that is. So if you were to surrender it...?\nHANNAH: (HANDING IT OVER) With pleasure. Damn thing’s out of ammo, anyhow.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nNYSSA: Doctor. Much as I, too, admire Ms Bartholomew’s spirit —\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, please. — Very well, my mind is made up. (FX: ACTIVATING CONTROLS) I’m setting the TARDIS controls for England, Earth, in the year nineteen hundred and eleven.\nNYSSA: (ALARMED...) You are-?\nHANNAH: Then that is a pity.\nNYSSA: That’s not what the Doctor means.\nDOCTOR: You see — in my experience, Ms Bartholomew, wherever I ask this temperamental old time and space machine to go: well, that seems to be the very last place she ends up arriving.\nHANNAH: Is that so?\nDOCTOR: Let’s put it to the test, shall we?\nDOCTOR: THE END"
