And this is the Business News.\nJINGLE: Business, Business, Business!\nCHAD: Our top story tonight.\nCHAD: The Drexel Corporation has put in a takeover bid for the Trans-Gal Media group. The spiralling fortunes of Augustus Scullop’s wide-ranging business behemoth have been big news in the financial pages for months now. Could his former partner’s company be the one to take it back into interplanetary dominance? We spoke to Xander Drexel at his Earth home earlier today.\nDREXEL: Look, no-one regrets what’s happened to Gus more than I do. Trans-Gal was a great company, we all know that. But it’s been floundering. Losing money by the bucket-load. If it’s to continue it needs a strong hand at the tiller, and with the greatest of respect, that ain’t Gus.\nCHAD: An offer was put to the company shareholders this morning and they’re expected to make a decision over the next seven days. But it would appear Augustus Scullop isn’t going down without a fight.\nCHAD: (CUT TO AN EXTERIOR. CHAD’S VOICE OVER CONTINUES OVER. LOTS OF\nFLASHBULBS: GOING UNDER AS SCULLOP AND SHEPHERD FACE THE MEDIA)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 2\nSCULLOP: (UNDER) No comment. No comment. No, I’m not answering any questions, thank you, don’t know how I can make it any clearer. Yes, excuse me please, you, yes, you, out of the way, please, out of the way.\nCHAD: (OVER) Rumours abound that this weekend will see the first trial screening of Trans-Gal’s latest attempt at reigniting their fortunes. Little is known about this top secret project, but it’s said to be the brain child of highly regarded communications scientist Doctor Helen Shepherd.\nSHEPHERD: (UNDER) Look I can’t say anything. No, sorry, I really can’t. It’s out of my hands. Soon as I can I’1l let you know.\nCHAD: She and several members of the board have joined a number of actors and crewmembers in flying to Scullop’s artificial planetoid home, ‘Transmission’, for a private viewing of the mystery television programme. If all goes well, a press launch is in the offing.\nCHAD: But whatever the project is, it might be too little, too late.\nCHAD: (OVER THESE LAST FEW LINES FADE INTO THE BROADCAST BEING WATCHED IN SCULLOP’S OFFICE)\nCHAD: After all, how good can one television show be? Can Scullop arrest his company’s sliding fortunes? Or is the writing finally on the wall for one of broadcast media’s greatest ever magnates. Time will tell. I’ve been Chad Walker and this has been Business —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 3\nSCULLOP: Off.\nSCULLOP: Too little too late. Too little too late!\nSHEPHERD: It doesn’t mean anything, it’s just speculation.\nSCULLOP: Too little too late!\nSHEPHERD: Of course he’s going to say that, he’s on Drexel’s channel.\nSCULLOP: I should have ruined that traitorous backstabber when I had the chance.\nSHEPHERD: I don’t know why you watch it. You’ve got news programmes of your own.\nSCULLOP: Yes, but I know what we’re saying. Always good to keep an eye on the opposition...\nSHEPHERD: How did they find out about the screening?\nSCULLOP: Same way they find out about everything else, presumably. Spies. Spies, spies and more spies. They’ve got eyes and ears everywhere.\nSHEPHERD: Really? You’d think that’d make them easier to spot.\nSCULLOP: (BEAT) Was that an attempt at a joke, Doctor Shepherd? A witticism? Only I haven’t noticed anyone laughing.\nSHEPHERD: I’m sorry.\nSCULLOP: Industrial espionage is a fact of life. They’re all jealous of me, you know. Jealous of my success.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 4\nSHEPHERD: I know. So you say. All the time.\nSCULLOP: Is everything ready for the screening?\nSHEPHERD: We should be ready to go within the hour. But some of the cast haven’t arrived yet...\nSCULLOP: That’s their problem. We start at my convenience, not theirs. Get it going. Let’s see them write off Augustus Scullop then. Your days are numbered, Drexel. When this show breaks you’re not going to know what’s hit you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 5\nFLIP: Doctor? Doctor? Where you got to? Doctor! Great, drop me in the middle of a labyrinth and then scarper, really chivalrous that is. Doctor!\nFLIP: (DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF A CRICKET MATCH, WITH\nCOMMENTARY: )\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Oh bravo, sir! Well played.\nFLIP: Doctor — ?\nFLIP: (SHE CONTINUES DOWN THE CORRIDOR, THE SOUNDS GETTING LOUDER.\nSHE: EASES OPEN A DOOR AND STEPS THROUGH. THE SOUNDS OF THE\nMATCH: GET LOUDER IN THE NEW ROOM, BUT REMAIN DISTORTED AS THEY’RE BEING VIEWED THROUGH THE TIME-SPACE VISUALISER)\nDOCTOR: (STILL WATCHING THE MATCH) Ha! The audacity! What a marvellous shot! [DIRECTOR’S QUESTION: BETTER CRICKET TERM TO BE HAD? ]\nFLIP: Er...\nDOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Jackson. Are you up?\nFLIP: Am I up? Course not, I’m wrapped up in bed, this is a figment of your imagination.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Take a seat. You’re just in time for the game.\nFLIP: You’re not listening to me, are you? Doctor, I’ve been wandering the corridors for hours.\nDOCTOR: Have you indeed? How marvellous for you. It’s barely started. The fifth one day international cricket match between Australia and South Africa 2006. I know the result of course, but I’m not going to spoil it for you. Sit down, sit down.\nFLIP: Alright.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 6\nDOCTOR WHO: Into your cricket, are you?\nDOCTOR: Well, not as much as I was, but you never lose the taste.\nFLIP: Not my game, really.\nDOCTOR: You’re more of a football fan I suppose.\nFLIP: Oi. Class prejudice. No. Can’t be doing with none of that stuff. Bunch of idiot millionaires playing kickabout in the park, no thanks.\nDOCTOR: So what is your sport of choice?\nFLIP: Bowls.\nDOCTOR: Bowls?\nFLIP: You never watched it? It’s well addictive on a bank holiday. You catch sight of a game on BBC2, you’re gone for hours. What is this, some sort of telly? Bit over-designed, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s far more than a mere television. This is a Time-Space visualiser.\nFLIP: A what?\nDOCTOR: A machine that takes energy from light neutrons and converts it into electrical impulses and therefore images. With this machine we can watch any event from any period of history at any time we want.\nFLIP: Blimey. Black and white.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Is that all you can say? This is incredibly advanced technology. Centuries ahead of your time. I offer you eternity and you complain it’s not in colour?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 7\nFLIP: It’s not that. We’re in a time machine. We already can watch any event from any period at any time. We go there. You could do this actual match live if you wanted. Why’d you want to watch it on this manky old thing?\nDOCTOR: Well, I, er... like the commentary. And besides, what if I wanted to go again? I might end up bumping into myself and that would be terribly awkward. Some of my other iterations can be astonishingly irritating.\nFLIP: You don’t say. I just expected a bit more excitement travelling through time and space. We meet up again, straight away there’s Daleks and Napoleon and the battle of Waterloo. I thought day two’ll be pretty exciting to top this. Spending it watching cricket on the telly wasn’t exactly my first guess.\nDOCTOR: It is a very good game. Be fair, Flip, I wasn’t actually intending to take on a new travelling companion. I’11 show you the universe in time, but there were some things I’d been planning to do.\nFLIP: (BEAT) Alright then, I’1l get some popcorn from that food machine-wotsit-thing and join you.\nDOCTOR: That’s the spirit. (BEAT) Oh, come now Umpire, that was clearly wide!\nDOCTOR: What the blazes? Something’s interfering with the signal... That shouldn’t happen.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 8\nNICK: Yeah, well, of course, I was offered Benedick at the Theatre of Light over in the Acteon Galaxy.\nMATTHEW: Really?\nNICK: You know it? Lovely space. Had to turn it down.\nMATTHEW: Oh.\nNICK: Peanuts. That’s what they were offering. Peanuts. You know what they say about them.\nMATTHEW: Er... no.\nNICK: Pay peanuts, get monkeys, you hear? And Nick Kenton’s no monkey.\nMATTHEW: Well, no, quite.\nNICK: So.. you got anything coming up, Matthew?\nMATTHEW: At the moment? Er, no. No, nothing really. It’s gone a bit quiet.\nNICK: Really? Hadn’t noticed.\nNICK: Olivia!\nOLIVIA: Oh God.\nNICK: Lovely to see you again!\nOLIVIA: Don’t touch me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 9\nNICK: (INNOCENT) What?\nOLIVIA: Matthew.\nMATTHEW: Hello. Problems getting here?\nOLIVIA: Interstellar highway was a nightmare.\nNICK: You were better off on it, this place is appalling. I mean, look at it. The buffet. Worst hospitality I’ve seen. Want us to starve. I mean, take this. You ever laid eyes on a smaller sandwich?\nOLIVIA: It’s a canapé, you idiot.\nNICK: A what?\nSHEPHERD: Excuse me, hello, could I have your attention, please?\nNICK: At last, they’re deigning to speak to us.\nSHEPHERD: Thank you for your patience, we’re getting the machine warmed up, we'll be able to begin the screening in a couple of minutes. Sorry about the wait. We’ll keep you informed.\nNICK: Fantastic.\nOLIVIA: It’s a complicated process, there’s bound to be teething problems, that’s the point of doing this pre-launch.\nNICK: What? I suppose. Bit of a fox though isn’t she, that Doctor Shepherd, eh, Matthew? Bit of a looker?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 10\nMATTHEW: I, er... wouldn’t know.\nNICK: Not your type, eh? Never mind, more for me. Wouldn’t mind getting televisual with her.\nOLIVIA: What does that even mean?\nNICK: Still. There’s plenty of free booze over there. Shame to waste it. Who wants some wine?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 11\nFLIP: Great. Two bags, fantastic.\nFLIP: Oh, there you are. I’ve got salted, I’ve got toffee. No sweet though, cos that’s rank. Hey, where you going?\nDOCTOR: The console room. We don’t have time for popcorn I’m afraid.\nFLIP: What? But I made it and everything.\nDOCTOR: Something’s interfering with the picture on the visualiser. All the sound you like but no images. That shouldn’t happen.\nFLIP: Well, calm down, adjust the aerial.\nDOCTOR: It’s rather more complicated than that.\nDOCTOR: (THEY WALK INTO THE CONTROL ROOM. FLIP STARTS TO EAT THR POPCORN. THE DOCTOR MANIPULATES THE CONTROLS )\nDOCTOR: That machine doesn’t work like a conventional television. Something’s interfering with reality itself. Warping it.\nFLIP: That don’t sound good.\nDOCTOR: Something of an understatement. The effects are potentially devastating.\nFLIP: So what we doing about it?\nDOCTOR: I’m trying to locate the source of the trouble. (A BEEP) There. The planet... Transmission.\nFLIP: Guessing that’s not its real name.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 12\nDOCTOR: Not a real planet if these readings are to be believed. It’s artificial.\nFLIP: What, like the Death Star?\nDOCTOR: ‘Death’... ? Er... Hopefully nothing so ominous. It isn’t necessarily a major problem, not with the right level of technology. Nonetheless we should probably stop by and ensure they know what they’re doing.\nFLIP: So. Cricket’s off then. You know, I’m oddly disappointed.\nDOCTOR: That’s the beauty of the Visualiser. There’s always another day for cricket.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 13\nSCULLOP: Yes, if you could take your seats quickly please. We don’t have all day.\nNICK: (MUTTERED) Could have fooled me.\nSCULLOP: What?\nNICK: Nothing, nothing.\nSCULLOP: Is that everyone? Good...\nMATTHEW: Er, not quite, the Porcians don’t seem to have arrived yet.\nSCULLOP: Then they should have left earlier, shouldn’t they? Not my problem.\nMATTHEW: I was just... saying...\nSCULLOP: Welcome, welcome, good day to you all. Thank you for coming. It’s greatly appreciated.\nNICK: (COUGHING THE PHRASE) Get on with it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 14\nSCULLOP: (BEAT. IGNORING HIM) Yes, as you may know I’ve not had the best time recently. Some unsuccessful commissions, an unco- operative ex-wife. With a rather sizeable alimony settlement. Extortionate in fact. Probably seduced the judge like all the rest of her flings, the witch. And, of course, the most heinous of betrayals by my former business partner, may he rot in hell. There were days when I thought about closing down Trans-Gal media. Closing it down and living a quiet life. But thanks to the valiant effort of Doctor Shepherd, and your sterling work over the last few months, I believe those days have passed. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And that light is my new show. Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I give you the very first episode of my new TV programme. ‘Laser’.\nNICK: About time too.\nSCULLOP: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Control room?\nSHEPHERD: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) Sir?\nSCULLOP: You may start.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 15\nDOCTOR: Here we are. Coming in to land and...\nDOCTOR: (THERE’S A JOLT. SUDDENLY THE MATERIALISATION SOUNDS WRONG.\nALARMS: SOUND. THE TARDIS GROANS. )\nALARMS: No!\nFLIP: What is it? This don’t sound right!\nDOCTOR: Whatever’s causing the effect’s been magnified. It’s twisting local space-time. Phasing it in and out.\nFLIP: It’s got worse you mean?\nDOCTOR: More than that. It’s doing what we’re doing! We’re squeezing through the gaps in reality at precisely the same moment it’s pulling them apart. Multiple unstable dimensional fields can’t operate in the same location. The component atoms could end up merged or dispersed or even destroyed!\nFLIP: And I presume we’re the component atoms. I thought you said this needn’t be a problem?\nDOCTOR: Not if I can bring the TARDIS back in sync with the timelines. I have to abort the materialisation, land close by but outside of the warp field, otherwise —\nFLIP: (FADING AWAY) Doctor! Doctor... I feel... weird...\nDOCTOR: What? No! Flip! You’re fading out —\nFLIP: (FADING FURTHER) What’s happening to me! Doctor, can’t you stop it? I don’t —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 16\nDOCTOR: She’s gone. One morning in and she’s vanished already, that’s a record even for me.\nDOCTOR: First things first. I’ll find a way to get her back later...\nDOCTOR: Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: (MACHINERY AS BEFORE, WITH SMALL BANGS AND FLASHES. MINOR PANIC FROM THE CROWD. SHEPHERD OVER COMMUNICATOR. )\nSCULLOP: What’s happening! I thought you said this thing was ready!\nSHEPHERD: (D) It was, it is, there’s interference in the reality matrix...\nSCULLOP: There'll be interference in your employment contract if you don’t get it sorted out.\nSHEPHERD: (D) I’m trying... There!\nSHEPHERD: (THE MACHINERY POWERS DOWN. THE BANGS AND FLASHES STOP, THE\nPANIC: SUBSIDES. )\nSCULLOP: That doesn’t appear to have fixed it. If I didn’t know better I’d think you’d switched it off.\nSHEPHERD: (D) I have to examine the systems, find out what the problem is. I can’t do that while it’s running.\nSCULLOP: More delays?\nSHEPHERD: (D) Do you want it to work or don’t you?\nSCULLOP: (OUT LOUD) Ladies and Gentlemen, apologies. It appears my praise for Doctor Shepherd was a trifle premature. We’1ll have to delay the premiere a little while longer.\nNICK: Oh, good grief...\nSCULLOP: If you would kindly return to the hospitality suite, we’ll let you know when things are ready. (BEAT) All right then, go. Get on with it, get out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 18\nSCULLOP: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) This better not happen twice, Doctor\nSCULLOP: Shepherd. I’m relying on you. I’ve invested a lot of money in this machine of yours. If it can’t do what you say —\nSHEPHERD: (D) Tt-can.- it wall.\nSCULLOP: It better. Get a move on.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: (EXT. SOUND: THE TARDIS MATERIALISES FULLY IN AN ECHOEY\nDOCKING: BAY. THEN INSIDE THE CONSOLE ROOM)\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Bit off the original target, but near enough. Now... to fand:..\nFLIP: (DISTANT, DISTORTED) Doctor! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Flip?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 20\nFLIP: (DISTORT) Doctor? Doctor are you there? I don’t know where I am, please...\nDOCTOR: Now that is odd.\nFLIP: (D) What? That is well weird, it's like your voice is everywhere. Doctor, is that you?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFLIP: (D) Oh thank goodness, I was so worried. I’m on some weird alien planet.\nDOCTOR: You can hear me?\nFLIP: (D) Yeah.\nDOCTOR: How? In your head?\nFLIP: (D) No... you're just sort of... all around me, like. What is it, some TARDIS gubbins like that translator thingy?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. We’re speaking through the visualiser.\nFLIP: (D) What? How does that work?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 21\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) I’ve no idea. Usually you input a specific location. It seems to have found you all by itself. I mean, I’m glad you’re safe, but... that is strange...\nFLIP: Well, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, eh? Where am I?\nDOCTOR: (D) I don’t know. I can’t see you, it’s only your voice coming through. Whatever the anomaly was that was interfering with the picture, it’s obviously ongoing.\nFLIP: Well, surely you know what’s happened to me? Where I went?\nDOCTOR: (D) You were pulled into the vortex. You could be anywhere, and in any time. The past, the future. There’s no way of telling.\nFLIP: Oh, fantastic. I’m stuck here, am I, I’m lost? Great. See the universe he says, all time and space he says, so glad I took you up on that offer.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 22\nDOCTOR: Don’t panic. There are ways and means. Tell me. Where you are, what does it look like? If there’s any unusual flora or fauna or if the environment’s especially idiosyncratic it might help me to identify your location.\nFLIP: (DISTORTED) Looks like.. looks like a quarry.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that doesn’t exactly narrow it down.\nFLIP: (DISTORTED) You are useless.\nDOCTOR: Now, now, I’m sure there’s a way around this.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 23\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED) Look, I’ve landed on the surface of Transmission, maybe if I can track down the source of the interference it’1ll give me a clue as to where it deflected you.\nFLIP: I’m not totally convinced by any plan that hinges on the word ‘maybe’.\nDOCTOR: (D) Well, I’m clutching at straws and it’s the best chance we've got. I’1l reconnoitre our surroundings and keep you informed of anything I find. We can’t lose this connection, so don’t go anywhere.\nFLIP: I’m on a barren alien planet, Doctor, where’m I gonna go, Tescos?\nWHAT: IS SHE SPEAKING INTO???\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 24\nDOCTOR: It might sound a stupid instruction, but you’d be astounded how many of my former companions were predisposed to ambulation.\nFLIP: (DISTORT) You mean ‘had a tendency to walk about’?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFLIP: (D) Well then why didn’t you say that?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry Flip. I’ll find you. Somehow or other.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 25\nFLIP: Yeah, you do that. Any time you want. (BEAT) Least I’ve got my popcorn.\nFLIP: (SHE STARTS TO EAT. A SCREAM NEARBY. A GROUP OF MONSTERS GROWLING)\nFLIP: Oh, now don’t. Not right away. He’s told me to wait, I’m going to wait. Don’t send me monsters now!\nJANCEY: (DISTANT) Help me! Help me, please!\nFLIP: Oh, for the love of — Oh, how hard can this particular bit of quarry be to find again? Right, that’s it. Sorry Doctor. Here\nFLIP: I go! (CALLING OUT) Oi! Don’t worry! I’m coming!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 26\nDOCTOR: Hmm. A docking bay... Let’s see where that interference is coming from... Tracker... on.\nDOCTOR: (HE SWITCHES ON A DEVICE. IT BEEPS A FEW TIMES.\nDOCTOR: CHIMBLY AND HIS FELLOW PORCIANS —ABOUT TEN — ARE APPROACHING, OINKING. DISTANT AT FIRST)\nCHIMBLY: That is the last time I let you give directions.\nJUNIOR: Sorry, Sir.\nDOCTOR: (SWITCHING OFF MACHINE) Better not be seen. Not before I know what’s going on.\nCHIMBLY: We should have been here yesterday. If you hadn’t suggested that left turn at Delta Magna...\nJUNIOR: I thought it was a short cut.\nCHIMBLY: A short cut? It doubled the journey time. Why couldn’t you use Star-Nav? I do not tolerate failure, you know that. I’ve told you often enough.\nJUNIOR: Yes sir.\nCHIMBLY: If the plan goes wrong because of you I won’t be responsible for my actions. This way men.\nDOCTOR: Porcians?!? What are those pigs doing here? I should — No. No, first things first. Rescue Flip. Then deal with them. So. The\nDOCTOR: source of the interference...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: (JANCEY UNDER ATTACK FROM GROWLING WARMONGERS. SHE’S SCREAMING LOTS)\nJANCEY: Help! Help, please someone, help!\nFLIP: Blimey. Space wart-—hogs?\nFLIP: Hey, leave her alone, pick on someone your own size! Actually, that would probably have been better if she wasn’t taller than you. You really are quite titchy, aren’t you?\nWARMONGER: Slobatuna dancrala liblon!\nFLIP: (BEAT) Sorry, what?\nJANCEY: Help! It’s the Warmongers! They’re trying to kill me!\nFLIP: The Warmongers? That’s these guys?\nWARMONGER: Cabalon tarilba!\nFLIP: Yeah, don’t understand what you’re saying, mate, I — hold on. Why don’t I understand what you’re saying?\nWARMONGER: Pentistananta! Raklasha!\nFLIP: Oh great, pigs with guns.\nJANCEY: They’re going to shoot us! (SCREAMS)\nFLIP: D’you think? (BEAT) Oi, Porkchop!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: Like popcorn? Chew on this!\nDOCTOR WHO: Leg it!\nJANCEY: How'd you know that’d distract them?\nFLIP: They’re pigs aren’t they? Eat anything. Seemed like a good idea...\nJANCEY: It was.\nJANCEY: They’re pursuing us. Quick! We have to get to your spaceship!\nFLIP: My what?\nJANCEY: Your spaceship. You must have landed close by.\nFLIP: I don’t have a spaceship. Well, not one I can get to.\nJANCEY: (BEAT) Then we must get to your teleport station!\nFLIP: Er, no, not got one of them either.\nJANCEY: (BEAT) Hypercar?\nFLIP: Nope.\nJANCEY: Travel bracelet?\nFLIP: sorry.\nJANCEY: Trans-dimensional wormhole gate?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 29\nFLIP: Not last time I checked.\nJANCEY: What do you have?\nFLIP: Pair of feet and some trainers?\nJANCEY: That’s it? That’s your plan? Keep running and hope they don’t catch us?\nFLIP: Yep.\nJANCEY: Wonderful.\nFLIP: I’m sorry! You were screaming, I came to help. That’s as far as I got. Quick, over this hill. (SHE SCRAMBLES UP) Look, there’s some caves over there. Maybe we can — jeez. There’s, like, bodies everywhere.\nJANCEY: Endless death. The terrifying legacy of Lord Krarn.\nFLIP: Who? Look, what happened here? What is this place?\nJANCEY: You don’t know? This is Earth. You’re in England.\nFLIP: Eh?\nJANCEY: It’s been like this for five years. Since the day it happened.\nFLIP: Since... since what happened?\nFLIP: Hold that thought. No time now. Those caves. Quick as you can!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: 18. CONTROL ROOM\nSCULLOP: (DISTORT) You’re ready? What was the matter?\nSHEPHERD: I don’t know. Whatever got caught in the field vanished as quickly as it arrived, I can’t find the slightest trace of it anymore.\nSCULLOP: (D) But you don’t know what happened? Where it came from, what it was?\nSHEPHERD: I’m afraid not.\nSCULLOP: (D) Then it might still be a problem.\nSHEPHERD: I don’t think so.\nSCULLOP: (D) It might still disrupt the screening.\nSHEPHERD: The systems are fine. There’s a slight anomaly in the recording, but that’1ll clear itself up, I’m sure.\nSCULLOP: (D) Are you? Are you really?\nSHEPHERD: Yes.\nSCULLOP: (D) Then we shall proceed. But remember. You embarrass me\nSCULLOP: further and I can find another scientist, you understand? Scullop out.\nSHEPHERD: Yes sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 31\nNICK: Yeah, can I speak to Jean, please? / It’s Nick, Nick Kenton. / Well, what do you mean she’s out of the office?\nOLIVIA: You know the more I hear that man, the more I’m amazed I was prepared to let him kiss me. No job pays that much.\nNICK: (INTO PHONE) Then find her, get her to call me back...\nMATTHEW: Better hope we don’t go to series, then.\nCHIMBLY: Bow down, humans. We have arrived.\nOLIVIA: Oh, hello.\nMATTHEW: Afternoon.\nNICK: (CLOSING PHONE) And look who’s decided to be fashionably late. Wanted to snatch the publicity did you?\nCHIMBLY: Er. Yes. Yes that’s it. That’s precisely the reason we delayed. Honest.\nMATTHEW: Don’t worry, you’ve not missed anything, there’s been... technical issues...\nCHIMBLY: Really?\nNICK: Delays, delays, delays. All we’ve had. Just been hanging around. It’s pathetic. What’s taking them so long?\nOLIVIA: Got somewhere you need to be going, have you?\nNICK: What? No. It’s just...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 32\nSCULLOP: Ladies and Gentlemen. I have received word from Doctor\nSCULLOP: Shepherd. If you would like to proceed to the screening room we will start the screening again. Only this time with no unfortunate errors.\nNICK: At last...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 33\nFLIP: Great. They’re passing. They won’t spot us in here.\nJANCEY: They’1l come back. They always come back.\nFLIP: What are they?\nJANCEY: (QUICK, ALMOST ROTE) The Warmongers. Brutal pig aliens, servants of the evil and indestructable Lord Krarn. Five years ago they invaded Earth at his command. No-one knows for sure how they did it, but it seems a human traitor helped open up a hyperspace tunnel from their homeworld. They appeared suddenly one day in all the major cities and wiped out the heads of government. Krarn installed himself as dictator of Earth and has been wiping out all the towns and cities that oppose him, killing everyone in them and levelling them to the ground. This is his latest conquest.\nFLIP: (BEAT) Right. Well that was comprehensive, thanks. So that barren wilderness out there used to be a town?\nJANCEY: Yes.\nFLIP: Which one?\nJANCEY: Stevenage.\nFLIP: Hmm. Well, it’s not changed that much. (PAUSE) They’re coming round again. Get further back, keep quiet. Don’t want them to hear us.\nJANCEY: They’1l find us. They’1ll find us and kill us.\nFLIP: No they won’t. Not if we don’t draw their attention...\nJANCEY: We’re dead. I tell you we’re dead! (SHE STARTS SCREAMING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 34\nFLIP: Oi, Oi, oi, what you doing?\nJANCEY: We’re doomed! (SHE SCREAMS MORE)\nFLIP: I — Oh, great, they’ve spotted us!\nJANCEY: I told you we’d be found! (SCREAMS)\nFLIP: Yeah, thanks Mystic Meg, no idea how you predicted that.\nFLIP: (WARMONGER LASER BLASTS STRIKE THE EDGE OF THE CAVE. SHOUTS\nFROM: OUTSIDE)\nFROM: Get back!\nFROM: Oh, fat lot of good you are. Right. Psycho pigboy and his mates out there. And no way out the back. Great. This wasn’t\nFROM: exactly my best idea ever.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 35\nSCULLOP: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) They’re in. You may start. Don’t prove me a liar again, Miss Shepherd.\nSHEPHERD: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) I won’t. (SHE SWITCHES OFF THE COMMUNICATOR. FLICKS BUTTONS. CROSSLY) And I’m usually known as Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING WITH BEEPING DEVICE) That’s funny, I was just about to say the same thing.\nSHEPHERD: What? Who are you?\nDOCTOR: What an unusual machine.\nSHEPHERD: Keep back, that’s a very expensive piece of —\nDOCTOR: This must be what was generating the spatial interference. What is this device, what does it do?\nSHEPHERD: What does it — ? My God. He was right. People are after the secrets. You’re a spy! I’m calling security.\nDOCTOR: I am not a spy. I’m not even secretive. Look at me. Would any spy be so willingly lacking in surreptitious guile?\nSHEPHERD: =<\nDOCTOR: You know if I didn’t know better I’d swear this was a system for televisual broadcast. But with this level of technology you’d have to be transmitting more than mere imagery.\nSHEPHERD: I doubt you’d be able to understand the science, it’s hugely ad- er, could you not touch that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 36\nDOCTOR: Ah! Of course. No wonder it interfered with the Visualiser, it’s the exact opposite. Rather than converting events into electrical impulses it converts electrical impulses into events. It’s a reality generator.\nSHEPHERD: You know what it does?\nDOCTOR: Naturally, it’s childishly simple.\nSHEPHERD: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: And you’re using it for television transmission?\nSHEPHERD: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Remarkable. Literally three dimensional shows, the world of the programme materialising around the viewer. Only — (HE\nSTOPS: HIMSELF) What’s that? That monitor there?\nSHEPHERD: That’s the live feed from the screening room.\nDOCTOR: That’s the programme this machine’s generating?\nSHEPHERD: Mister Scullop’s pilot, yes.\nDOCTOR: Where is that room? Tell me.\nSHEPHERD: What?\nDOCTOR: It’s vital I get there this second. Please. Where is that room?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: (JANCEY SCREAMING. THE MONSTER ADVANCE INTO THE CAVE, GROWLING)\nFLIP: Alright you lot, don’t get any closer. I’ve got... Okay, I don’t have anything I can threaten you with, just stay back anyway, tt’ s polite, it's =\nFLIP: Hold on. Can you... can you hear music?\nLASER: Hey!\nFLIP: Who the hell’s that?\nLASER: Why don’t you pick on someone your own size, you porcine midgets!\nFLIP: That’s my line! He used my line!\nJANCEY: (STOPS SCREAMING) Oh my God! It’s him! It’s really him!\nLASER: Take that!\nLASER: (THE MUSIC GETS DRAMATIC. GUN BLASTS BACK AND FORTH. SOME\nWARMONGERS: SQUEAL AND RUN. THE OTHERS SHOUT MORE GIBBERISH. )\nFLIP: What exactly is going on?\nLASER: Damn. Looks like my gun’s out of power. Let’s see how you like\nLASER: the feel of my fists!\nLASER: (HE STARTS FIST FIGHTING THE MONSTERS. MUCH WARMONGER SHOUTING, SOME RUNNING OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 38\nFLIP: He’s beating them up? And they’re just letting him? Why don’t they shoot him?\nJANCEY: They wouldn’t dare.\nLASER: (THUMPING THE LAST REMAINING WARMONGER) Have you learnt your lesson yet? Well then don’t (THUMP) do it (THUMP) again!\nLASER: There. They’1l think twice about coming back. You ladies alright?\nJANCEY: We are now!\nFLIP: EY...\nLASER: Glad to have been of service. Those Warmongers have been getting above themselves lately, I’d have been mortified if you'd been hurt.\nFLIP: Thanks. But who are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: 23. SCREENING ROOM\nSCULLOP: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Hello? Hello?\nSCULLOP: (THE CAVE SCENCE CONTINUES IN THE SCREENING ROOM, SLIGHTLY DISTORTED, AS IF AN ELECTRONIC IMAGE. )\nLASER: Jack Laser. And it looks like I was just in time.\nFLIP: Your name’s Laser? And people tell me my name’s weird. Who was your dad, Bob Geldof?\nLASER: This way.\nFLIP: What, we’re following you, are we? Right you are...\nSCULLOP: Where is the blasted woman?\nNICK: What is going on? I don’t remember filming that!\nSCULLOP: I know, I know, I’m trying to reach Doctor Shepherd...\nCHIMBLY: This isn’t quite what I was expecting from the screening.\nMATTHEW: Erm...\nOLIVIA: Who’s that girl? You cast a new love interest in this without telling me? That’s outrageous. Who is she?\nSCULLOP: I’ve no idea! I haven’t the faintest notion who that is!\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) That is Philippa Jackson. Otherwise known as Flip.\nSCULLOP: Who in — ? Guards! We’ve got an intruder!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 40\nDOCTOR: No, wait, listen to me! That’s my friend. Don’t you see? Somehow or other she’s got herself trapped inside your television programme!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 41"

Calls himself the Doctor.\nOLIVIA: Are we going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 42\nDOCTOR: Can we leave the cross-examination for the moment, it’s imperative I get my friend out of there!\nSCULLOP: Who is he?\nSHEPHERD: Not a clue. But he does seem to know what he’s talking about.\nDOCTOR: Please, you must see there’s a problem with your production!\nSCULLOP: There’s nothing wrong with it.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps not before, but there certainly is now. And I’m the only person that can repair it.\nSHEPHERD: I did say there was an anomaly in the recording, it could be this gentleman’s friend.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nSCULLOP: Meet me in my office. This is not the place for a discussion. Doctor Shepherd, show him the way. You’re apparently good at that.\nSHEPHERD: Follow me.\nDOCTOR: Lead on.\nSCULLOP: I’m sorry for the commotion, ladies and gentlemen. We seem to have a foreign body infecting our piece. Rest assured all possible steps are being taken to rectify the situation. If you'll just wait here...\nNICK: This day gets better and better...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 43\nJUNIOR: (MUTTERED) Doctor, sir! She called him Doctor!\nCHIMBLY: (MUTTERED) I know. I don’t like the sound of this. If the Doctor’s here he could interfere with our plans. Follow them. Discretely. Find out what he knows.\nJUNIOR: Yes, sir. (MAKES TO GO)\nCHIMBLY: No, not so fast, I haven’t finished yet.\nJUNIOR: Oh, sorry, I thought —\nCHIMBLY: Find out what he knows. If he does intend to make a nuisance of himself... we may have to leave his scenes on the cutting room floor. For the rest of his life! (EVIL LAUGH. PAUSE) Alright, that’s it, I’m done, you can go now.\nJUNIOR: Thank you sir.\nJUNIOR: (JUNIOR EXITS. THE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN RUNNING ON WITH AMBIENT\nSOUND: SINCE THE CLIFFHANGER, BUT NOW IT REJOINS FLIP, JANCEY AND LASER)\nFLIP: Jeez, bit of a walk, isn’t it? Thank goodness it’s Stevenage and not Edinburgh, don’t think I could stand all those hills...\nMATTHEW: Oh, hello. Looks like we’ve caught up with the action again...\nNICK: Wow. Is that really what I look like? I — am — gorgeous. Best- looking thing in this show.\nOLIVIA: Thanks.\nNICK: What? Oh, you’re tolerable Liv, don’t get me wrong. But look at those cheek-bones. Camera loves me. Loves me.\nOLIVIA: Oh, good grief.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 44\nFLIP: Where we heading for, your spaceship?\nLASER: It’s parked over there.\nJANCEY: Wow. Turbo-temporal-fusion engines and a dymetrecite hull! It’s one of the most advanced ships I’ve ever seen!\nLASER: Course. Earth corps don’t skimp on expenses. Not when lives are at stake.\nFLIP: But... turbo-temporal-fusion? Dymetrecite?\nLASER: Yes?\nFLIP: That’s nonsense isn’t it? Gobbledegook. I’m no Stephen Hawkings, but I’ve seen Star Trek and I know technobabble when I hear it.\nLASER: I don’t pretend to understand the science myself, all I know is it works.\nFLIP: Yeah, but —\nJANCEY: Thank you for rescuing us, Mister Laser. Who knows what we'd have done without you.\nLASER: That’s quite alright. It’s my job. When we get to the ship I’1l signal home command. Get a transporter, take you two out of danger. (BEAT) Oh, but where are my manners, I don’t even know your names!\nJANCEY: Jancey, I’m called Jancey.\nLASER: Jancey? Lovely name. Lovely name for a lovely woman.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: And you? What do they call you young lady?\nFLIP: They don’t call me young lady for a start.\nLASER: Ha! You’re a perky one, aren’t you?\nFLIP: (BEAT) My name’s Phillipa. But they call me Flip.\nLASER: Good to meet you, Flip. I was impressed by your bravery at the\nLASER: cave. Few are prepared to face down the Warmongers without a weapon.\nFLIP: Oh. Well, it’s just what I do, really.\nLASER: Don’t undersell yourself. It’s a rare quality. Be proud of it.\nFLIP: Er.. okay. Cheers.\nJANCEY: I was quite brave too.\nLASER: .yeeeess. Here we are.\nLASER: (THEY'VE REACHED HIS SPACESHIP. HE PRESSES A SWITCH. A RAMP\nHISSES: OPEN)\nHISSES: Home sweet home. Welcome aboard.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 46\nLASER: If you’ll make your way to the Space-Lounge, I can —\nFLIP: What is it with the music?\nKRARN: Mister Laser.\nLASER: Krarn. I might have known. I thought I detected a certain stench in the air.\nKRARN: Did you? Well, let me assure you that soon the only stench you'll be smelling will be the one emanating from your putrefying corpses.\nJANCEY: No!\nFLIP: That doesn’t work.\nKRARN: What?\nFLIP: How’ll we be able to smell our putrefying corpses if we’re dead?\nKRARN: (BEAT) Um...\nLASER: How did you get past the security lock?\nKRARN: It appears not everyone in Earth Corps is entirely on your Side. They provided me with a universal code-breaker.\nLASER: It was a trap?\nKRARN: A trap I have now sprung.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 47\nJANCEY: No! We’re all going to die!\nFLIP: Not again...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 48\nDOCTOR: You’re telling me everything happening to Flip is actually occurring now? That it exists for her in reality?\nSHEPHERD: That world, its people. They’re simultaneously fictional and real.\nDOCTOR: So if she’s wounded in any way —\nSHEPHERD: The wound’s as genuine as any incurred in her ordinary existence.\nDOCTOR: That’s taking verisimilitude to a whole new level.\nSCULLOP: We call the process ‘Reel-Life’. R, double-e, 1. Neat little pun.\nDOCTOR: You’11 forgive me if I don’t applaud your linguistic mastery quite yet.\nSHEPHERD: The reality generator creates a dimensional bubble containing the world of the programme, a world derived from the recorded performances of the actors.\nDOCTOR: And this bubble is overlaid onto our dimension at the place of screening, both dimensions co-existing at the same point in space-time?\nSHEPHERD: I know it’s a difficult concept to grasp —\nDOCTOR: Not at all, it’s dimensional transcendentalism. My people have been utilising that exact science for centuries. Albeit for purposes a little more advanced than mere entertainment.\nSCULLOP: Don’t knock mere entertainment, Doctor. For some people it’s all they have.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 49\nDOCTOR: No wonder it interfered with the TARDIS’ arrival. It’s hard enough maintaining the simultaneous stability of two secured dimensional fields, four is asking for trouble.\nSHEPHERD: TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: My... Ship. We must have passed through your bubble during materialisation. The different realities intermingled for a split second and Flip was snatched away by the fictional universe. We’re lucky it was only her.\nSCULLOP: We are?\nDOCTOR: If I’d been lost as well we’d have very little hope of unravelling this mess. As it is, we might just have a chance. (BEAT) Can we not simply stop the screening? Get her out of harm’s way?\nSHEPHERD: It wouldn’t work. The dimensional bubble maintains a separate existence. Usually the characters follow a pre-programmed path\nDOCTOR: They stick to the script, in other words?\nSHEPHERD: Precisely. But they don’t stop being there the moment the story moves away or you stop transmitting. They’re still alive. They move into a sort of holding pattern. Maintaining a physical reality but not doing anything that impacts upon the plot.\nDOCTOR: Even without recorded material?\nSHEPHERD: We don’t need a script in reality, why should they? They’re alive. That’s the problem. Their ability to exist independently of the narrative means that if a new factor’s introduced, like your friend —\nDOCTOR: - then they start to improvise, for want of a better term.\nSHEPHERD: We’ve no means of telling where the story’s going.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 50\nDOCTOR: If only I could talk to her!\nSCULLOP: But you did before, you said.\nDOCTOR: I could reach her through the visualiser because that machine and yours are based on the same technology, that’s why the transmission interfered with my signal. But now she’s moved from the reception field she’1ll be impossible to track down.\nSHEPHERD: So, what’s the plan?\nDOCTOR: I think I should take a closer look at this machine of yours. If I can understand precisely what happened there’s every chance I can reverse the process.\nSCULLOP: A closer look?\nDOCTOR: Is that a problem?\nSCULLOP: This isn’t some elaborate ruse is it?\nDOCTOR: Ruse? To what end?\nSHEPHERD: Mister Scullop is a little paranoid about spies.\nSCULLOP: Your machine is a unique creation, Doctor Shepherd, worth a fortune to my competitors, I think some prudence is appropriate under the circumstances.\nDOCTOR: I can assure you my only interest is in the wellbeing of my\nDOCTOR: friend.\nSCULLOP: Very well. Follow me.\nJUNIOR: Um... er.. hello. Is this not the toilets?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 51\nSCULLOP: No.\nJUNIOR: Oh. Sorry. Must have got lost...\nSHEPHERD: Was he listening in?\nDOCTOR: Apparently so. Perhaps Mister Scullop’s fears of espionage aren’t quite so unfounded as one might think.\nSCULLOP: It’s an actor. Him and the rest of his species played the monsters in the show. He picked the wrong door or something. Nothing to be worried about.\nDOCTOR: On the contrary, that is a Porcian and they’re very, very dangerous indeed. Worrying about them should be high on everyone’s agenda. But for the moment, we have more pressing priorities. The reality generator, come along.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 52\nWARMONGERS: Rob la shumbla/Ploypli schlumblom.\nFLIP: You know, I still can’t understand a word they’re saying.\nLASER: Universal translators don’t work with the Warmongers. No linguists survive long enough to make a detailed study of the language.\nFLIP: But the way the Doctor said it, it’s automatic. The TARDIS reads their minds, figures out what they’re saying, that’s what I hear. Should be able to understand them.\nLASER: Doctor? TARDIS?\nJANCEY: Now you’re just making up words.\nFLIP: Yeah, well, it’s a bit hard to explain. With any luck he’1l be along soon and I won’t have to bother. Sort this lot out. (BEAT) Why’s this Krarn bloke not killed us anyway? Why lock us up, not shoot us?\nLASER: That ulcerous monstrosity must have some other nefarious scheme in mind.\nJANCEY: I hear he likes to make his victims suffer. He is a truly evil man.\nFLIP: Or he’s rubbish at his job. He’s like every Bond villain you’ve ever seen. All walking away from elaborate death traps, then acting all surprised when the hero turns up with a harpoon gun and a punchline.\nLASER: You intrigue me, Flip. You appear so innocent and yet talk of many dark things. Who are these Bond villains of which you speak? Did they hurt you?\nFLIP: You are weird, you know that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 53\nKRARN: I trust my subordinates have been keeping you... entertained.\nFLIP: Yeah, they’ve broken out the Jenga, Twister, it’s been like Christmas at me nan’s.\nKRARN: yes. I thought you would like to know, Mister Laser, that your plans have failed. Soon the Earth will be mine.\nLASER: You fiend.\nKRARN: It need not have been this way. Had you not killed my wife I would not have made the universe feel my vengeance.\nFLIP: (TO LASER) You did what?\nLASER: It’s not as it sounds. It was... an accident.\nKRARN: You could have saved her.\nLASER: Only at the expense of thousands of other lives!\nFLIP: What exactly happened?\nKRARN: Um...\nLASER: EY...\nKRARN: It’s not important right now. All that matters is you know I\nKRARN: am one step closer to my ultimate victory.\nJANCEY: What do you want, you monster?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 54\nKRARN: Isn’t it obvious? To take over the universe. (EVIL LAUGH)\nFLIP: Why?\nKRARN: (BEAT) What?\nFLIP: Why'd you want to do that? It’d be a proper huge job looking after it, think of the admin.\nKRARN: I...\nFLIP: I mean, the universe is like well vast. More trouble than it’s worth. Actually, I reckon when you say universe you mean galaxy, that’d make more sense, lots of people get them confused. Even then it’d be hard work.\nKRARN: It seems to me that you are hard work.\nFLIP: And how does killing everyone on Earth help you towards that anyway? I can’t make out how it’s a logical step in the process.\nKRARN: Everyone must die at my hands.\nFLIP: Yeah, but why? You must have a reason.\nKRARN: Because... because... Oh, shut up! (PAUSE) The universe will know my pain. My only regret is that you, Jack Laser, will not be there to see it.\nFLIP: This gets stranger all the time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE TAIL END OF THE PREVIOUS SCENE CONTINUES IN THE SCREENING ROOM, SLIGHTLY DISTORTED)\nFLIP: Why’d he even come in here? Just ranted a bit and then went out again.\nLASER: He likes to gloat.\nFLIP: But still. People need a reason to do stuff. What did he gain? Something deeply odd’s going on here.\nNICK: You know, you can be quite scary when you try, Matthew.\nMATTHEW: Oh, um. thanks. Just said the lines. All in the script. Though that wasn’t exactly... me.. there. Now. As such.\nNICK: Really? Yeah, I don’t remember filming that either. Must have had a rough night.\nOLIVIA: You have no idea how this process works, do you?\nNICK: I’m not paid to understand the kit, love. That’s the techies’ job. They’re the ones who like playing with fairy lights, not me.\nMATTHEW: Never did work out that back story precisely, did we? The wife’s death thing.\nNICK: Told you, he’s saving that for the series. Don’t want to play something different in the pilot, it’d get confusing.\nMATTHEW: Yes, but.. you know... felt a bit... unprofessional.\nJUNIOR: Sir, sir!\nCHIMBLY: Ah, you're back. What have you learnt?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney\nJUNIOR: pretty much nothing sir.\nCHIMBLY: (BEAT) Remind me what I pay you for?\nJUNIOR: It’s not my fault. I was discovered.\nCHIMBLY: Discovered?\nJUNIOR: The Doctor seemed very interested in the to look at it. I couldn’t get out of the\nCHIMBLY: The machine, eh? Perhaps he is after the We may have to accelerate our plans.\nCHIMBLY: Page 56\nCHIMBLY: machine. He was going way quickly enough.\nCHIMBLY: same thing as we are.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 57\nSCULLOP: Do be careful with that, it’s incredibly valuable.\nDOCTOR: So’s Phillipa. Doctor Shepherd?\nSHEPHERD: Yes?\nDOCTOR: This machine of yours. It isn’t technically yours at all, is piers\nSCULLOP: What’s he talking about?\nSHEPHERD: I’ve no idea.\nDOCTOR: Come now. This creation outstrips humanity’s current level of advancement by centuries if not millennia. Either you’re an unbelievably gifted scientific genius or this is of alien manufacture.\nSCULLOP: Doctor Shepherd?\nSHEPHERD: (BEAT) I bought it fair and square.\nDOCTOR: Aha! I knew it!\nSCULLOP: This is old technology? I’m paying a large portion of my Significantly diminished fortune for something that already exists?\nSHEPHERD: Not used for this precise application, no.\nSCULLOP: That hardly matters! My copyright’s worthless! Anyone could duplicate this! Drexel could duplicate this!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 58\nSHEPHERD: I think you’re underestimating the input I’ve had into its development —\nSCULLOP: Am I? Rest assured, Doctor Shepherd, that when this crisis is over, I shall be going over the small print of your contract in microscopic detail.\nSHEPHERD: Yes, Mister Scullop.\nDOCTOR: Where precisely is it from?\nSHEPHERD: (BEAT) It’s Dashran.\nDOCTOR: Ah! The legendary Dream-Spinners of Dashrah, yes, you know I’ve always wondered what happened to them. Even tried to find out once...\nSCULLOP: Who?\nDOCTOR: A great lost race of the ninth galaxy. Long dead. They were able to warp reality itself to their very will, alter the physical realities of space-time through detailed computation and mathematical processes. You know, that makes this machine incredibly dangerous.\nSHEPHERD: How so?\nDOCTOR: A machine that can outwit the scientific laws of our universe? How can it not? Whatever fiction this machine creates, it becomes real. No matter how nonsensical, no matter how outlandish. It can rewrite reality, history, all time and Space as we know it!\nSHEPHERD: But only within the bubble dimension.\nDOCTOR: A dimension you’ve overlaid onto ours! Any interaction of the two could lead to total disaster!\nSHEPHERD: Hence the security protocols.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 59\nDOCTOR: The what?\nSHEPHERD: I’m not as stupid as you think. This circuit here keeps the dimensions ‘separate’ in time. The bubble’s a few seconds ahead of us, that’s why we can see it, pass through it but they can’t see us. There’s no possibility of interaction.\nDOCTOR: But if you remove that circuit the different realities would align themselves with each other! People would be able to cross between them.\nSHEPHERD: After about five minutes, yes.\nSCULLOP: You could step into the programme? Get this Phillipa of yours out?\nDOCTOR: Theoretically.\nSCULLOP: Then why don’t you do that?\nDOCTOR: Because it’s a deeply irresponsible thing to do. We can’t risk anything created in that dimension getting out into this one!\nSCULLOP: (BEAT) I see.\nDOCTOR: But it does give me an idea. The bubble’s in a different time period, you say?\nSHEPHERD: Two point six seconds ahead of us, I think it is.\nSCULLOP: So?\nDOCTOR: Time is a speciality of mine. If I create a fluctuating pulse within the security protocols, I should be able to make the two dimensions connect for the tiniest fraction of a moment on a recurring loop, once every second.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 60\nSHEPHERD: Not enough for anything to pass from the fictional dimension to ours —\nDOCTOR: But enough for me to slip through in my TARDIS, pick up Flip and get out again. With exceptional piloting skills, of course.\nSHEPHERD: It could work. You can do that?\nDOCTOR: I am very good.\nSCULLOP: Then get on with it. The screening’s been disrupted enough already. In fact, I should be getting back there now. The actors will be restless, you know what they’re like...\nDOCTOR: By all means.\nSCULLOP: Doctor Shepherd, we shall speak later.\nSHEPHERD: Thanks for that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, my pleasure.\nSHEPHERD: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nSHEPHERD: You were worried about the Porcians. Who are they, what do they do?\nDOCTOR: The Porcians? Invade planets, mostly.\nSHEPHERD: What? And that’s what’s worrying you? An attempted take-over?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 61\nDOCTOR: What? Oh no, no. Not remotely. That’s not troubling me at all.\nSHEPHERD: Then what?\nDOCTOR: The problem isn’t them invading planets. The problem is that they’re not very good at it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 62\nWARMONGERS: Rongle-shonga. Shabbla-maspartan. Slibbly-doodell.\nJANCEY: Why hasn’t he done something?\nLASER: You know, I think I’ve had just about enough sitting here. I think it’s high time we escaped.\nFLIP: What? How’d you plan on doing that?\nLASER: Follow my lead.\nKRARN: Gentleman and ladies. The hour of your execution is at hand.\nLASER: Is it indeed? I think I know someone who might disagree with you.\nKRARN: And who might that be?\nLASER: Ask them. They’re standing right behind you.\nKRARN: (TURNING) What?\nLASER: You two, run!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 63\nFLIP: Can’t believe he fell for that...\nLASER: For a world conquering dictator he really isn’t all that bright...\nFLIP: And still the music!\nLASER: Of course.\nJANCEY: There’s always music at moments like this.\nFLIP: Dramatic ones? This is beginning to make a crazy sort of sense\nFLIP: Oh, crap, get off me!\nFLIP: (LASER AND JANCEY SKID TO A HALT AS FLIP AND THE WARMONGER STRUGGLE)\nLASER: It’s got you!\nFLIP: Way ahead of you mate!\nJANCEY: No! Let me go! (SCREAMS )\nFLIP: Oh, would you not shut up!\nJANCEY: Go, Jack! Save yourself!\nFLIP: Who made you spokeswoman?\nLASER: I’m not leaving you!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 64\nJANCEY: Go, get help! You can’t save us if you’re dead.\nJANCEY: (LASER BLASTS FROM BEHIND. THE GROWL OF MORE ADVANCING WARMONGERS. BEAT)\nLASER: I'll be back.\nKRARN: There he goes. Fleeing like the coward he is. Kill him.\nKRARN: (THE WARMONGERS SHOOT. A DEADLY BARRAGE OF FIREPOWER FOR AS\nLONG: AS POSSIBLE. BEAT)\nLONG: Missed.\nFLIP: Yeah, from, like, ten yards! Not exactly crack shots, are\nFLIP: they? They’re like terrorists trying to take out Bruce Willis.\nKRARN: Are you criticising my Warmongers?\nFLIP: Wanna make something of it?\nKRARN: He will not have gone far. Bring the women. I think I have a means of persuading his return.\nJANCEY: Why are you trying to anger him? He kills people for\nJANCEY: breakfast, he’s insane!\nFLIP: Trust me. I know what I’m doing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 65\nDOCTOR: Sonic probe.\nSHEPHERD: There you go. (GIVES IT TO HIM) Three PHDs and I’m acting like a surgical nurse. (SIGHS) So. The Porcians try to conquer planets but they’re what? Not good at it?\nDOCTOR: Notoriously so. They’re quite a joke in the galactic community. They invade worlds that are about to be destroyed in supernovae, worlds that are actually carnivorous, worlds that just happen to be called Skaro — or they take the wrong equipment, accidentally blow up their entire invasion fleet, get sucked into a black hole before they can arrive. Whatever it is, they always lose, though give them their dues, they’ve never made the same mistake twice.\nSHEPHERD: So why do they do it?\nDOCTOR: Have you never had ambitions you couldn’t fulfil? If you really desire them you keep trying, you persist. The Porcians see the spectacular achievements of the Daleks and the Cybermen and think they can manage the same. Unfortunately they don’t have the talent or ability to pull it off.\nSHEPHERD: Oh my God. They’re wannabe alien invaders?\nDOCTOR: That’s about the size of it, yes.\nSHEPHERD: But if they’re so bad, what’s the problem? Surely rubbish alien invaders are better than good ones?\nDOCTOR: Not for them. They’ve wiped out nearly their entire species with one hair-brained scheme for galactic domination or another. Whenever I’ve encountered them before I’ve taken all manner of risks to prevent their imminent extinction.\nSHEPHERD: But surely that’s their problem, not ours.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 66\nDOCTOR: Whatever they’re planning, and they are planning something, I can promise you that, whatever it is, they’ve messed it up. That’s what they do. And you don’t want to be within a million miles of one of their failures when it happens. They’re often more damaging than any possible success could be.\nSHEPHERD: Collateral damage?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes to the tune of whole planets.\nSHEPHERD: I can see why you might be worried.\nDOCTOR: We'll deal with them later. Take the communicator. Clear the screening room and let me know when it’s empty. I don’t want to risk anyone getting trapped between dimensions at an inopportune moment. Then I’1l set the pulse and head for the TARDIS.\nSHEPHERD: On my way.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Nearly there...\nDOCTOR: (TURNING) Did you forget some(thing) — ?\nCHIMBLY: Ah. Doctor. We meet again.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Not now.\nCHIMBLY: Cover him.\nJUNIOR: Sir.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Alright, which one are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 67\nCHIMBLY: You don’t recognise me?\nDOCTOR: I’ve met several of your species in my time. You’re walking pigs in silver bodystockings and cloaks — and whilst your generic appearance is undeniably distinctive, individually you are quite hard to tell apart.\nCHIMBLY: You’re saying we all look the same? Bit racist.\nDOCTOR: Well?\nCHIMBLY: I am the Porcian known in our mother tongue as ‘Death Bringer, slayer of all, destroyer of Worlds’.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Which in English is pronounced ‘Chimbly’.\nCHIMBLY: I believe so.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I suspect it loses some dramatic impact in translation. I remember you. Balastron Seven, wasn’t it?\nCHIMBLY: Amongst others.\nDOCTOR: Mister Chimbly —\nCHIMBLY: Doctor! I don’t intend to waste any more time on you than I need to. Kill him.\nJUNIOR: Sir.\nDOCTOR: What? No!\nCHIMBLY: Excellent. He is dead. (BEAT) You did remember to put it on the kill setting, didn’t you?\nJUNIOR: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 68\nCHIMBLY: Only there was that time you had it on stun —\nJUNIOR: It’s on kill, sir, look.\nCHIMBLY: Oh. Yeah. Good. (BEAT) Excellent. He is dead. We may proceed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: (KRARN OPERATES A CONTROL. HIS FIRST SPEECH IS SLIGHTLY AMPLIFIED)\nKRARN: Listen to me, Laser, I know you can hear this. You must surrender immediately. If you do not return to your spacecraft within five minutes, I will execute the women you left behind. Starting with the one called Jancey.\nFLIP: Who, if I remember rightly, didn’t tell you her name. So how d’you know it?\nKRARN: What? Um...\nJANCEY: Are you saying I’m a traitor?\nFLIP: I’m saying it’s a continuity error. Hey mate, don’t start with her, start with me.\nKRARN: You?\nFLIP: Yeah, it’s dead boring hanging round here, let’s get it over with.\nKRARN: You willingly embrace death?\nFLIP: I don’t embrace nothing. You can stop it now. I know what’s going on.\nKRARN: (BEMUSED) What’s going on?\nFLIP: It’s pretty obvious. Dramatic music. Technobabble. The way you couldn’t hit the hero from point blank range?\nJANCEY: I don’t —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 70\nFLIP: You’re fake! Fictional! What is this, a military re-enactment society? One of those immersive education centres?\nKRARN: Do not try my patience, girl.\nFLIP: Or what, you’ll shoot me? Come on, I’ve seen more realistic guns on Blue Peter. Go on. I dare you. I double dare you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 71\nSHEPHERD: Doctor? Doctor, are you there?\nDOCTOR: (WAKING) What? Where am I?\nSHEPHERD: Is that you?\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) I thought they'd... but I seem to be fine... what happened there then?\nSHEPHERD: Doctor, have you installed the pulse into the security protocols?\nDOCTOR: (FINALLY COMING ROUND) Er... no, no. I was close but... the Porcians...\nSHEPHERD: Then you need to get up here. I think something awful’s about to happen.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 72\nKRARN: I have murdered millions of people on your world. You think I would hesitate to shoot you.\nFLIP: Well, you haven’t yet, have you?\nWARMONGERS: Robla-shalobla! Clamble peltula!\nFLIP: Yeah, you lot can shut up too. I mean, it’s not like you’re really talking to each other. That’s why I can’t understand you. It’s not actually language. You’re just making up a load of gibberish and pretending it’s words.\nJANCEY: You're making him angry!\nFLIP: And it’s why you’re either screaming or talking like you’re reading the plot summary off Wikipedia.\nKRARN: I need only one hostage.\nFLIP: Give it a rest!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 73\nNICK: Wow. This is getting good. Tense.\nMATTHEW: I don’t think I like where this is going...\nDOCTOR: What is it? What’s the —\nFLIP: I get it. You’re not real.\nDOCTOR: No.\nFLIP: You can stop pretending.\nSHEPHERD: She thinks it’s safe.\nKRARN: You don’t think my threat serious?\nFLIP: Nah.

Face is the same, yes, but...\nKRARN: Destroy him!\nNICK: No!\nNICK: That could have killed me!\nKRARN: Am I to be surrounded by fools!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 78\nNICK: Oh, stuff this!\nNICK: Out the way! Get out the way! Talent coming through!\nKRARN: No! Come back! I will not lose you twice in one day! Come back so I may kill you! (PAUSE) After him! Destroy all who stand between us!\nKRARN: (THE WARMONGERS GRUNT, THEN BLAST THEIR WAY FROM THE ROOM,\nMORE: SCREAMS AND DEATH FROM MISCELLANEOUS CAST AND CREW)\nMORE: (TO ROOM IN GENERAL) The rest of you! Do not think you have escaped my fury. All will die. I swear it. (TO REMAINING WARMONGERS) Summon the rest of the Warmongers from the wilderness. I would have this place levelled to the ground!\nMATTHEW: That was.. horrible, that was... me...\nSHEPHERD: (AFTER A MOMENT, QUIETLY) Doctor? Doctor, I think they’ve gone.\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Yes.\nSHEPHERD: Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: Am I alright? Am I alright! Flip’s dead. She’s dead! He shot her. He shot Flip.\nSHEPHERD: I know. I saw.\nDOCTOR: He killed her without the slightest thought, the slightest compunction —\nSHEPHERD: He’s insane. He’s a killer.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 79\nDOCTOR: I’m going into the programme. Maybe it was just an injury, a flesh wound —\nSHEPHERD: You saw the blood Doctor, you saw what happened to her, no-one could survive that —\nDOCTOR: If there’s the slightest hope, the slightest chance, I have to save her.\nSHEPHERD: There isn’t! Doctor, I know you’re upset, but you have to be realistic, there are more of those creatures in there... he’s summoned them!\nDOCTOR: I am not giving up, not yet. If you want to go you are more than welcome, but I will not abandon her!\nSHEPHERD: I’d better come with you.\nDOCTOR: Take my hand.\nSHEPHERD: Okay. (DISGUSING NERVES) Funny, I’ve never been on telly before.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSHEPHERD: Sorry, bad timing. I’m just a bit... nervous.\nDOCTOR: I understand. Here we go!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 80\nCHIMBLY: Excellent. We have what we came for. We may leave.\nJUNIOR: We did well, sir.\nCHIMBLY: What?\nJUNIOR: Er... we did well?\nCHIMBLY: I know! That’s implicit in the whole ‘we’ve got what we came for’ bit. You don’t need to state the blinking obvious every time!\nJUNIOR: Erm...\nCHIMBLY: Activate launch sequence.\nJUNIOR: Launch sequence activated.\nJUNIOR: (HE PRESSES A BUTTON. AN ALARM RINGS OUT FROM OUTSIDE THE SHIP)\nJUNIOR: I didn’t do nothing!\nALERT: (THROUGH TANNOY) Attention vessel.\nCHIMBLY: What the —\nALERT: Unauthorised launch attempted.\nCHIMBLY: Un-authorised?\nALERT: Planetoid entering security lockdown. No departures allowed without personal key-code of Augustus Scullop.\nCHIMBLY: Personal — what on — did you know about this?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney\nJUNIOR: No!\nALERT: Please abandon your vessel!\nCHIMBLY: Oh, swill.\nCHIMBLY: Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 82\nSHEPHERD: This is.. strange... this close it looks fake, but it’s... it’s not. It works, it’s real. (BEAT) Is she — ?\nDOCTOR: No pulse. She’s gone.\nSHEPHERD: I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: She was so young. So young, only... (PAUSE) That’s amazing. You know, I’ve no idea how old she was. Human maturation’s hard to gauge at the best of times...\nSHEPHERD: Human?\nDOCTOR: I was going to show her the universe. And I got her killed.\nSHEPHERD: You couldn’t have known.\nDOCTOR: Couldn’t I? I’m not like you, Doctor Shepherd. I carry death with me everywhere I go. It was only a matter of time...\nSHEPHERD: We have to go now...\nDOCTOR: There’s always a risk. I knew that. But I save them. I always save them. Why couldn’t I save her?\nSHEPHERD: You can mourn her later. We’re on a fictional Earth surrounded by fictional killing machines that are coming to destroy us. We need to get out of here.\nDOCTOR: I’m not leaving her! Dead on the floor in a reality that isn’t\nDOCTOR: even her own?\nSHEPHERD: She wouldn’t want you to join her, would she?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 83\nDOCTOR: I’1l come back Flip. I’1l take you home.\nSHEPHERD: The screening room. Let’s go.\nSHEPHERD: If we hurry we can make it to the docking bay and get off Transmission...\nDOCTOR: We’re not going anywhere.\nSHEPHERD: What?\nDOCTOR: We have more important priorities.\nSHEPHERD: Such as?\nSHEPHERD: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Well, him for a start.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: (JANCEY RUNNING DOWN A CORRIDOR. DISTANT GUN BLASTING AND DEATH)\nJANCEY: Way out... way out.. there’s got to be a way out somewhere —\nOLIVIA: You?\nJANCEY: No! They’ve made an evil android duplicate of me! I’1l be killed! (SHE SCREAMS)\nOLIVIA: No, no, no, calm down, calm down, I’m not here to kill you!\nJANCEY: You are here to kill me! Why else would you have stolen my face! (MORE SCREAMS )\nOLIVIA: No, no, I’m really not!\nJANCEY: What do you want, you monster?\nOLIVIA: I'm. I’m not a monster, I’m — oh, this is difficult...\nJANCEY: You’re going to kill me and replace me and infiltrate the resistance movement in my place, aren’t you, that’s what you’re planning!\nOLIVIA: There is no resistance movement!\nJANCEY: Keep back!\nOLIVIA: Okay, okay, look, please listen to me, just listen to me, I’m trying to get out of here too, like you, you understand, I just want to get out of here!\nJANCEY: You... do?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 85\nOLIVIA: Yes, I —\nOLIVIA: Oh no!\nJANCEY: It’s the Warmongers! (SCREAMS)\nOLIVIA: Right, no time to explain, follow me!\nJANCEY: But... but you’re on their side!\nOLIVIA: I’m not.\nJANCEY: You’re evil.\nOLIVIA: They’re shooting at me too, you stupid cow, we’re clearly not\nOLIVIA: friends!\nJANCEY: Um...\nOLIVIA: This way. The docks, we can get off world... Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 86\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Doctor Shepherd, you know this reality better than I do, how do you defeat these creatures?\nSHEPHERD: You can’t, they’re indestructible.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSHEPHERD: Lasers, bullets, nuclear explosions, nothing stops them.\nDOCTOR: Nothing?\nSHEPHERD: It was more dramatic that way.\nDOCTOR: So first you unleash onto our galaxy a race of psychotically insane killing machines. Now you’re saying they’re impossible\nDOCTOR: to destroy for no better reason than because you say so?\nSHEPHERD: I’m sorry...\nDOCTOR: Perhaps if we draw it over here, we'll be able to double back\nDOCTOR: around it, get out into the screening room and then —\nSHEPHERD: Doctor! There’s another one!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, never mind, it wasn’t a very good plan anyway.\nDOCTOR: Hold on? What’s that music?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 87\nLASER: (APPEARING) Hello boys. You missed me?\nLASER: (LASER STARTS TO BEAT UP THE WARMONGERS TO DRAMATIC FIGHT MUSIC. PUNCHING, KICKING UNDER)\nSHEPHERD: Okay, this is strange...\nDOCTOR: That, I presume, is our leading man.\nSHEPHERD: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Why aren’t they shooting him?\nSHEPHERD: He’s the hero, they can’t kill the hero.\nDOCTOR: Well, that one’s certainly going to make an attempt.\nDOCTOR: Except it would appear guns are useless against someone who can kick quite high.\nLASER: Naughty, naughty!\nWARMONGER: And that’s enough from you!\nDOCTOR: So they’re totally indestructible, in all circumstances... unless they’re hit in the face by that gentleman?\nLASER: Are you two alright? Sorry I wasn’t here earlier. Traffic was a pain.\nSHEPHERD: (REPLYING TO THE DOCTOR) Looks like it.\nDOCTOR: Then I think we should make his acquaintance. Thank you for your assistance, Mister — ?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 88\nLASER: Laser, Jack Laser.\nDOCTOR: Good to meet you, I’m the Doctor and this is — another Doctor.\nSHEPHERD: Helen Shepherd, hello.\nLASER: I don’t know either of you, are you from Stevenage? (SPOTS THE BODY) Flip!\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLASER: He killed her! Does that fiend know no mercy?\nDOCTOR: Apparently not.\nLASER: I will destroy him for this!\nDOCTOR: You’ll have to wait in line.\nLASER: What? Look, we should get out of here. That cry the last Warmonger made? It’s a battle call. This place’1ll be swarming with them any minute.\nDOCTOR: That’s fine. I know precisely where we’re heading. Come along.\nSHEPHERD: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: We’re finding the Porcians.\nSHEPHERD: What? Why?\nDOCTOR: Because they stole the security circuit. We need to force Krarn and the Warmongers back inside this programme, but before we do, we need that circuit back or we’ll never be able to seal the bubble dimension up again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: (FRANTIC PRESSING OF BUTTONS INSIDE SHIP. ALARM BLARING IN\nBACKGROUND: )\nCHIMBLY: Come on, come on! The code’s got to be guessable.\nJUNIOR: I’ve tried ‘password’ a few times, that’s all I could think of.\nCHIMBLY: Well, think harder! They’1ll figure out what we’ve done eventually, then they’1ll come after us!\nCHIMBLY: (OUTSIDE THE SHIP, THE DISTANT COMMOTION OF A CROWD\nAPPROACHING: )\nAPPROACHING: What’s that? Sounds like an awful lot of people for a security detail —\nAPPROACHING: (CUT OUTSIDE. A PANICKED MOB RUSHING INTO THE DOCKING BAY FOR THEIR SHIPS.\nAPPROACHING: CUT INSIDE)\nJUNIOR: There seems to be some sort of mass panic, sir. A stampede.\nCHIMBLY: They do look rather keen to leave the planet.\nJUNIOR: Yes. Which we’ve just made impossible for them to do.\nCHIMBLY: Mmmm. Yes. You know, I’ve got the feeling we’re not going to be terribly popular.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR, LASER AND SHEPHERD STEP INTO REALITY OVER THE\nNEXT: FEW LINES. FAINT DISTORTION AS THEY DO)\nLASER: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: The Porcians will be trying to escape, we should head for the docking bay.\nSHEPHERD: That’s where I said we should go!\nDOCTOR: Yes, but we’re not leaving. I imagine —\nMATTHEW: Erm...\nLASER: You! (TO THE DOCTOR AND SHEPHERD) Get down! Die you sulphurous abomination!\nMATTHEW: No!\nLASER: You deflect my shot! You side with this treacherous human atrocity?\nSHEPHERD: That’s not Krarn! That’s Matthew Howland.\nLASER: Who?\nDOCTOR: The actor who plays Krarn from the looks of him.\nSHEPHERD: He’s one of the good guys. When he’s not a bad guy.\nDOCTOR: My apologies, Mister Howland, I don’t think we’ve been introduced, I’m the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 91\nMATTHEW: Er.. hello. Doctor. I’m... I’m sorry about your friend, I feel... sort of responsible...\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, well, don’t worry, I’ve no grudge against you.\nLASER: I do not understand. Actor?\nDOCTOR: Take it from me, he’s on our side. You’d better come with us Matthew. We’ve got reality to save.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 92\nJANCEY: We don’t seem to be getting anywhere.\nOLIVIA: I’m doing my best.\nJANCEY: I should have waited for a man to rescue me. Then I’d have been safe. A big, strong man. Instead of a weak woman.\nOLIVIA: Oh, for crying out loud! Why did I ever agree to play you? You’re a vacuous stereotype! You set feminism back centuries...\nJANCEY: You’re just jealous because I’m prettier than you.\nOLIVIA: We’ve got the same face! We’re identical.\nJANCEY: Anger ages you.\nOLIVIA: Right, which way now?\nJANCEY: You don’t know?\nOLIVIA: I was in a bit of a rush when I arrived. I didn’t memorise the route. And with those creatures everywhere we have to be careful.\nJANCEY: Fantastic.\nOLIVIA: They’re close. You can hear them.\nJANCEY: Oh, yeah.\nOLIVIA: They must be down one of these corridors.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 93\nJANCEY: Well, if you don’t know which, looks like I’1l have to save the day. Let’s try... this one...\nJANCEY: Yes. It’s safe. There’s no monsters down here.\nOLIVIA: Right. Let’s go.\nOLIVIA: How did you know?\nJANCEY: What?\nOLIVIA: That it was safe?\nJANCEY: I didn’t hear any music. They always play music when there’s going to be an ambush...\nOLIVIA: No! That’s not how it works (here) —\nKRARN: (ADVANCING) So. You thought you could escape me.\nJANCEY: Ah! You shot her, you — (SCREAMS)\nKRARN: Hello again.\nJANCEY: You killed her! Is that what I’11l look like when I’m dead?\nKRARN: Let’s find out, shall we?\nKRARN: (HE RACKS THE GUN. JANCEY SCREAMS. AND SCREAMS. THEN HER\nSCREAMS: LOSE CONVICTION THE LONGER THEY CONTINUE.

I could take your life so very easily.\nJANCEY: You are going to kill me!\nKRARN: Why?\nJANCEY: What?\nKRARN: Why do I need to? You’re no threat to me. A pathetic screaming imbecile with no more sense than a rat.\nJANCEY: A pretty rat?\nKRARN: So why? To what end? What do I gain?\nJANCEY: Um... I really don’t know.\nKRARN: How does it help me achieve anything?\nJANCEY: Well...\nKRARN: Answer me! Tell me what I should do. She questioned me and I do not know the answer.\nJANCEY: I honestly haven’t a clue, I —\nKRARN: (BEAT) You see, that was no fun at all. I didn’t enjoy killing either of you. It’s ruined. It’s ruined now. She’s spoilt it for me!\nSCULLOP: Excuse me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 95\nKRARN: You dare sneak up on the invincible Lord Krarn! Who are you to\nKRARN: show this lack of respect? Why should I not kill you now?\nSCULLOP: Because my name is Augustus Scullop. Hello. I think I can\nSCULLOP: offer you a deal.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 96\nCHIMBLY: Put up the shields. They’1ll want their stuff back...\nJUNIOR: Sir.. sir.. I don’t think they’re after us.\nCHIMBLY: What?\nJUNIOR: I think technically... we’re after them...\nJUNIOR: (CUT OUTSIDE AS THE WARMONGERS SWARM INTO THE DOCKING BAY. GUN BLASTS. PEOPLE SCREAMING, DYING. BACK INSIDE: )\nCHIMBLY: But... but that’s us...\nJUNIOR: Us in the show, yes.\nCHIMBLY: They’re wearing our outfits. That’s horrible.\nJUNIOR: I know. They’re killing everyone.\nCHIMBLY: What? Not that! They’ve stolen our intellectual property. That look’s copyright. (YELLING OUT) Oi! You lot! I’m going to sue the backsides off of you! This is character assassination! In every sense of the —\nJUNIOR: I think that was the catering ship.\nCHIMBLY: Was it? Yes. Forcefields up. I think we should focus back on cracking that code and getting out of here...\nJUNIOR: I think you’re right, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 97\nMATTHEW: What’s going on in there?\nLASER: I recognise that sound. That sound is the torment the Warmongers inflict upon their victims.\nMATTHEW: Oh dear.\nSHEPHERD: Here he is.\nSHEPHERD: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: It’s as I feared. There’s about twenty of them. The Warmongers have herded most of the crowd to the docking bay, but no-one can get off world.\nSHEPHERD: Of course! One of Scullop’s anti-theft devices. You can’t leave the planet without his express permission.\nDOCTOR: Is he really that paranoid?\nSHEPHERD: Doctor, he’s practically bankrupt, he’d do anything to save his skin.\nDOCTOR: So it would appear. And the precautions he’s taken are leading to a massacre. The more I hear of that man the less and less tolerable I find him.\nMATTHEW: The Warmongers are killing everyone?\nLASER: It’s what they do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 98\nDOCTOR: Not quite everyone. Some people have managed to find sanctuary within their ships, though I can’t imagine that’1ll keep them alive for long. Those creatures have ludicrously advanced weaponary, quite literally. Weapons whose existence defies all logical rationality.\nSHEPHERD: And the Porcians?\nDOCTOR: Pinned down inside their craft. But we’ve no means of obtaining access. Unless...\nSHEPHERD: What?\nDOCTOR: Unless someone here attempts a vaingloriously insane act of heroism.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 99\nKRARN: And so, yet again, you arrive in the nick of time to foil my\nKRARN: plans.\nLASER: What can I say? I’m good at my job.\nKRARN: You think so? Because I think it is time you got — FIRED!\nKRARN: Stop it. Stop it now.\nSCULLOP: Off.\nSCULLOP: Lights.\nSCULLOP: Of course, this is a more conventional television than we usually use. You lose the full 3-D effect, you see, that costs\nSCULLOP: extra...\nKRARN: That was... me. That was me on there.\nSCULLOP: Yes.\nKRARN: And Laser.\nSCULLOP: Yes. I’ve got several copies. (BEAT) You’re confused, I know. I can tell. Don’t be.\nKRARN: It is... a fantasy?\nSCULLOP: Mmmm, an entertainment. A scientific romance.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 100\nKRARN: I can scarce believe it. She said I was not real. She said I was... fictional...\nSCULLOP: Yes, and so you are.\nKRARN: How is this possible?\nSCULLOP: The science baffles even me, I’m afraid.\nKRARN: Oh.\nSCULLOP: If it’s any consolation your creation required an awful amount of monetary outlay.\nKRARN: I am not real.\nSCULLOP: Yes, I think you’re getting caught up on the details.\nKRARN: I feel real. Yet you tell me I am... fictional...\nSCULLOP: Is that so bad? In our world we go through life blind. Narratives unfulfilled. Incomplete. No-one gets a happy ending. Whereas you — you’ve a guiding hand behind you. A creator, steering your course.\nKRARN: You?\nSCULLOP: Yes.\nKRARN: You are saying you’re a god?\nSCULLOP: God? Yes. I like that. I am a god. Your god.\nKRARN: Mine?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 101\nSCULLOP: And I think you’re wonderful. I love my creation.\nKRARN: I see.\nSCULLOP: Well?\nKRARN: Well what?\nSCULLOP: Don’t you want to know why I’ve brought you here?\nKRARN: Why you’ve — ?\nSCULLOP: A god doesn’t speak to his creations without good cause. Not directly. He lets them carry on, living their lives without divine intervention. Usually.\nKRARN: You desire something?\nSCULLOP: I knew you were smart, I wrote you smart.\nKRARN: What do you want?\nSCULLOP: I want you to kill Xander Drexel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 102\nLASER: Hey, there! You jumped up bunch of pork scratchings!\nLASER: I’m feelin’ peckish for some hamburgers!\nDOCTOR: Hamburgers, good grief.\nLASER: You’1l need more than that to stop me!\nLASER: (LASER SCREAMS AND CHARGES THEM. BATTLE ENSUES. LOTS OF BLASTING)\nDOCTOR: Quick, while he’s got them distracted.\nMATTHEW: Which one’s the Porcian ship?\nDOCTOR: Over there. Quicky! He might be laser proof but we’re not...\nSHEPHERD: Is he going to be alright?\nDOCTOR: He can certainly handle a couple, but two dozen at once may be beyond his expertise. Though we have established they can’t actually kill hin...\nLASER: (YELLING) Is that all you’ve got? I could wipe you out if I’d lost both my arms in an unusual combine harvester accident.\nDOCTOR: . SO maybe they’1l just take him prisoner. This way!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 103\nCHIMBLY: Come on, come on! There’s got to be some over-ride procedure.\nJUNIOR: I’m looking. (MUTTERING AS HE READS) Air conditioning... stereo system...\nCHIMBLY: Try the index.\nJUNIOR: It’s written in Japanese...\nDOCTOR: I’d forget about the manual. I don’t think you’1ll be going anywhere soon.\nJUNIOR: You?\nCHIMBLY: The Doctor, but — but you’re dead.\nDOCTOR: Am I? Oh, I’m so glad you’ve told me. It would have come as a dreadful shock otherwise, I’1ll have to cancel the milk...\nJUNIOR: How did you get on board? The force-field’s up, the ship’s in lockdown —\nSHEPHERD: (ENTERING WITH MATTHEW) You left the back door open.\nJUNIOR: Oh.\nSHEPHERD: Yes, and — (SHE STOPS. SNIFFS) Urgh.\nDOCTOR: Easy mistake to make. Come along Matthew...\nMATTHEW: Yes.. oh, gosh, that’s a bit... strong...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 104\nDOCTOR: It does smell rather, doesn’t it? Cover your nose.\nSHEPHERD: It stinks! And it’s the messiest spaceship I’ve ever — it’s like a — well, like a —\nDOCTOR: Pigsty, yes.\nCHIMBLY: But you’re dead, Doctor, you’re dead! We killed you. It was on the right setting and everything!\nDOCTOR: Demonstrably not, unless I’m the chattiest corpse in history...\nCHIMBLY: I — (BEAT) You did leave the guns in the charger last night, didn’t you?\nJUNIOR: Um...\nCHIMBLY: Oh, for goodness sake, it wasn’t full power? Again you have failed me! You know how I deal with failure!\nJUNIOR: A stern word and a request not to do it again?\nCHIMBLY: That’s the one.\nDOCTOR: Quiet!\nCHIMBLY: Sorry I spoke.\nDOCTOR: My friend is dead because of you!\nCHIMBLY: What?\nDOCTOR: If you hadn’t blasted me into unconsciousness I would have been able to save her! But instead, due to your asinine dreams of conquest, a young girl’s blood stains the floor of a universe she should never have known.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 105\nCHIMBLY: I don’t know nothing about that —\nDOCTOR: I don’t doubt it. Your lack of knowledge, your fatuous miscomprehension, these things are hardly in question!\nCHIMBLY: Now that’s just rude...\nDOCTOR: How many more deaths does it require? How much pointless suffering do you need to cause before you realise how futile your insane pursuit of the smallest inconsequential success is?\nCHIMBLY: Um...\nDOCTOR: Just be grateful I am not a man who delights in revenge. Now, quickly, hand over the security circuit.\nCHIMBLY: The what?\nDOCTOR: On the double! The sooner you do, the more lives we can save.\nCHIMBLY: But.. I don’t know anything about a security circuit.\nSHEPHERD: What?\nCHIMBLY: I’ve no idea what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: When you tried to kill me! The element you stole from the machine. I’ve no idea what you hoped to achieve by such a foolhardy action but we need it back!\nCHIMBLY: We didn’t steal anything! We did a system scan, copied the design, that’s all —\nDOCTOR: Copied the design?\nCHIMBLY: Yes. That Mister Drexel got in touch, paid us for a detailed breakdown of its workings. Quite a bit of money it was.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 106\nSHEPHERD: Scullop was right. Industrial spies.\nCHIMBLY: You always need money in the invasion game. Certainly the way we do it. That’s all we did. Honest.\nDOCTOR: So if you didn’t sabotage the machine... who did?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 107\nSCULLOP: Had the idea when the Doctor was talking to Shepherd, you see. Without the security circuit my creations could step out into reality. Why wipe Drexel and his stinking corporation out metaphorically when I could do it for real? When those pig things blasted the Doctor away, I was presented with an opportunity. I ripped that circuit from its housing. And here you are.\nKRARN: You hate this Drexel so?\nSCULLOP: He betrayed me. Stole half my business from under my nose. My best customers, ideas, programmes. All of them. Gone. Ruined me.\nKRARN: I know what it is to be forsaken.\nSCULLOP: You do, yes. I’d forgotten. Now he seeks to destroy me completely. Take the pieces he left behind. I won’t let that happen.\nKRARN: What would you have me do?\nSCULLOP: Lead your beasts into the heart of his empire. Tear it apart from within, destroy its very soul.\nKRARN: I am to kill him?\nSCULLOP: Well, that’s the idea. You’re an indestructible evil psychopath. It should come easily.\nKRARN: That’s how you made me.\nSCULLOP: You're learning well. He must die with agonising slowness watching his company burn. Knowing it’s my hand twisting the knife.\nKRARN: How do we do it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 108\nSCULLOP: It wouldn’t be without complications. He does not go unprotected.\nKRARN: I have my Warmongers. They are born to kill.\nSCULLOP: But even then you might not have enough.\nKRARN: So?\nSCULLOP: This room contains every copy of ‘Laser’ we have. Ready for distribution. And there, a duplication device. I run these through Shepherd’s machine... and you can have an infinite army. Even Drexel can’t stop that.\nKRARN: ‘Laser’.\nSCULLOP: Yes.\nKRARN: It’s called... ‘Laser’.\nSCULLOP: The show, yes.\nKRARN: Why?\nSCULLOP: Because he’s the lead, he’s the hero.\nKRARN: I see.\nSCULLOP: Is something the matter?\nKRARN: (BEAT) I’m the bad guy.\nSCULLOP: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 109\nKRARN: He destroys my happiness, kills my wife and yet I am the bad\nKRARN: guy.\nSCULLOP: It’s supposed to have been an accident, we still haven’t worked out the details...\nKRARN: That’s not important. You could have written me good. Why didn’t you write me good? I would have been happy.\nSCULLOP: Well, where’s the drama in that?\nKRARN: (BEAT) Drama? Drama! Is that all it was? That is all it is to you? Drama!\nSCULLOP: It’s a television programme.\nKRARN: So? I am alive, I exist, I feel! You killed my wife and for what, dramatic impact?\nSCULLOP: EY...\nKRARN: When your life’s destroyed, you expect sympathy. You expect me to help make reparations, take revenge. What’s the matter? Don’t you like DRAMA?\nSCULLOP: —\nKRARN: Not so nice when it happens to you. When it’s your world being ripped to shreds. It hurts, it burns. Death isn’t entertainment!\nSCULLOP: You’re taking this very personally —\nKRARN: You killed my wife to make me evil, how can I not take it personally!\nSCULLOP: (CHOKING) Stop — no — you’re — choking me —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 110\nKRARN: Am I, am I really, I hadn’t noticed.\nSCULLOP: Please, I —\nKRARN: You have responsibility to those you create. If you give us life you must honour that life, you must not hurt us for no reason —\nSCULLOP: T=\nKRARN: What sort of sick mind creates only to give pain? To torture his children for the entertainment of others?\nSCULLOP: You’re not... real...\nKRARN: If I’m not real who’s throttling you?\nSCULLOP: Please — have mercy —\nKRARN: MERCY! If you wanted mercy you should have written me more three dimensionally!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 111\nDOCTOR: It has to be Scullop. He was conspicuously absent when the security protocols failed.\nMATTHEW: Scullop?\nSHEPHERD: But why? Why risk disaster in his back garden?\nDOCTOR: That question must wait for another time. The important thing is we contain the Warmongers. We can’t let them out into the universe. They’ll cause unimaginable devastation across reality with the same ruthless efficiency as they did in the fiction.\nCHIMBLY: You’re not breaking the lockdown? We still can’t get off- world?\nDOCTOR: Fortunately, Mister Chimbly, those of us who haven’t spent our hours on this world engaged in illicit activities need not be in a rush to depart.\nCHIMBLY: What, with psycho monsters outside and everything?\nDOCTOR: The moment we let them out the universe is doomed, don’t you understand that? Our lives aren’t worth the death of infinity!\nCHIMBLY: Speak for yourself.\nJUNIOR: Dad, I’m scared.\nCHIMBLY: Not Dad! Not when we’re at work, I’ve told you, it’s sir!\nJUNIOR: Sorry, Sir Dad.\nSHEPHERD: But we’re in lockdown, they won’t be able to get out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 112\nDOCTOR: Scullop can give them the codes.\nMATTHEW: Worse than that, he doesn’t need to. Krarn’s got a universal code-breaker. I remember the line. It’s how he got onto Laser’s ship in the show.\nDOCTOR: Another ludicrously implausible technological device, oh, you really did make this far too easy for him. Well, without that circuit we'll have to find another way to stop them.\nJUNIOR: Erm, Doctor — ?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nJUNIOR: I think your friend outside’s a little, er.. subdued...\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: No!\nSHEPHERD: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The Warmongers have overcome Laser. They’re heading this way!\nSHEPHERD: But there’s no way off this ship without passing them. They’re going to kill us!\nDOCTOR: That would appear to be their strategy, yes. You know... I think this would have been a good point to have had a plan, don’t you...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 113\nKRARN: 2: What... what is this place, I — You!\nKRARN: No, no my brother.\nKRARN: 2 Who are you? How do you dare steal my face?\nKRARN: It is alright. We are the same. We are one. (LAUGHS LIGHTLY) So he told the truth. An infinite army awaits.\nKRARN: 2 What do you want?\nKRARN: The same as you. Meaningless destruction and death. For ever. For ever and ever. Always.\nKRARN: 2 I do not understand.\nKRARN: It will take time. Salvation dawned on me slowly. Today I destroyed my creator. I became a god. And it would appear a vengeful god. Let it be so. It seems that is how I am written.\nKRARN: 2 Written?\nKRARN: Yes. I was created for one purpose and one purpose alone. To kill every last living being in the cosmos. Without conscience, without remorse, without.. motive. You want that too, do you not, brother?\nKRARN: 2 Yes. Yes, it is all I desire.\nKRARN: Of course it is. What else can we do? We have no choice. It’s how we are made.\nKRARN: 2 We must do what we must do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 114\nKRARN: Exactly. And we know what it is we must do. Destroy everyone and everything in the entire universe for no good reason at all. And with an infinite army nothing can stop that from happening. Brother. I think it’s time for some audience participation.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: EPISODE FOUR\nOPENING: THEME\nDOCTOR: Right, they’re nearly through. Be ready.\nSHEPHERD: Do we have any choice?\nCHIMBLY: This is a really bad idea...\nDOCTOR: And you would know. Here they come.\nWARMONGERS: Roblashambla! Libladoolda!\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN) Halt, my warriors!\nMATTHEW: It is I, your master. Lord Krarn.\nWARMONGERS: (CONFUSED) Ralpshalpa? Shpalpool-schplob?\nMATTHEW: Yes, I know I’m wearing a slightly different outfit from usual but it’s... um.. dress-down Friday...\nDOCTOR: (HISSED) Dress down Friday?\nMATTHEW: (HISSED) I was never good at improvisation...\nMATTHEW: Wait! These humans are not to be harmed! They are under my\nMATTHEW: protection... In fact... no-one is to be killed. Your previous orders are countermanded.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 116\nMATTHEW: You may leave. Do not worry about me. I have more of your number right here. (BEAT) Don’t I?\nCHIMBLY: What? Oh, yes, er... Flob-a-dob-lib-lob-lib.\nDOCTOR: Oh, for goodness sake...\nMATTHEW: Back to Laser’s ship.\nWARMONGERS: (GRUMPY) Shploblob. Rongleshanks.\nMATTHEW: What are you waiting for? Go! Oh, and release Laser while you’re at it!\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s it. Off you pop.\nDOCTOR: And relax.\nMATTHEW: (SIGHING HEAVILY) Crikey, that was tense.\nDOCTOR: The performance of your life, Matthew. Literally.\nSHEPHERD: It was too risky.\nDOCTOR: But it bought everyone left alive on this planetoid time, Doctor Shepherd, that’s what’s important.\nCHIMBLY: I’m more concerned about us, we might have been killed.\nDOCTOR: Oh, were you scared, Mister Chimbly? Frightened? Like my friend was before she died due to your interference?\nCHIMBLY: Alright, now steady on —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 117\nDOCTOR: Not nice, is it? To see potential mortality hovering before you. Those creatures are what you want to be, you simpleton. The apotheosis of your ambition. You really want to inflict that onto other people?\nCHIMBLY: Um...\nDOCTOR: We should go. With the Warmongers holding fire we’1ll be safe for the moment.\nMATTHEW: But... but they’re bound to meet the real Krarn soon, aren’t they, he’ll send them after us.\nDOCTOR: Which is why we need to find a more permanent solution. And you’ve just clarified for me what that is.\nMATTHEW: Eh?\nDOCTOR: The trick is to fight fire with fire, if you’ll pardon the cliché.\nSHEPHERD: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen the screening equipment, Doctor Shepherd, but do you have anything for recording? Making new footage?\nSHEPHERD: Of course, why?\nDOCTOR: You’ve heard of the director’s cut? I think it’s time for the Doctor's.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE BUZZ OF A KRARN STEPPING INTO REALITY, FOLLOWED BY\nSEVERAL: SNARLING WARMONGERS )\nKRARN: 3 What... what is happening? Why are there two of me?\nKRARN: Excellent. It works once more.\nKRARN: 2 There need be no end to my army.\nKRARN: 3 But —\nKRARN: Save your questions. They have no relevance now.\nKRARN: 2 You, Lord Krarn, will accompany Lord Krarn in the elimination of any remaining survivors. He will explain everything whilst you do.\nKRARN: I am, after all, the original.\nKRARN: 3 The — ?\nKRARN: 2 I will remain here and continue the multiplication of our forces\nKRARN: 3 This makes no sense.\nKRARN: Our lives never have. We are not human beings, we are a cancer. Our sole purpose is the destruction of life, all life, across the galaxy. Come with me and help us fulfil our destiny. This way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR, THE PORCIANS, SHEPHERD AND MATTHEW CROSSING THE\nBAY: )\nCHIMBLY: Blimey. Quite a few corpses...\nJUNIOR: I want to go home.\nMATTHEW: These poor people... so many...\nDOCTOR: Merely the start of the atrocities Krarn will initiate if we don’t proceed quickly. Doctor Shepherd, you know the way.\nSHEPHERD: Follow me.\nMATTHEW: I was too busy ducking to notice the bodies before. No, that’s\nMATTHEW: Sarah from make-up, she was so sweet...\nLASER: (CHARGING IN) Have no fear, friends, I will save you!\nCHIMBLY: What? No!\nCHIMBLY: (LASER STARTS TO THUMP CHIMBLY VIOLENTLY IN THE FACE. SQUEALS IN PAIN)\nLASER: Will you over-grown sausages never give up!\nSHEPHERD: Jack, no!\nDOCTOR: Oh, you can let him continue this time.\nMATTHEW: No!\nSHEPHERD: That’s not a Warmonger, that’s a Porcian.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 120\nLASER: A what? Ah! Another one of these ‘actors’ you talk of?\nDOCTOR: Only of the most inept and superficial kind.\nCHIMBLY: Charming. And the Oscar for biggest git goes to —\nDOCTOR: Quiet!\nJUNIOR: I’d leave him alone, I’ve a feeling he’s not very happy.\nLASER: They are on our side?\nDOCTOR: They’ve agreed to assist us. AS can you.\nLASER: Great, you know me, always willing to help.\nSHEPHERD: How?\nDOCTOR: Mister Laser can be our advance warning. If he walks ahead of us, he’ll draw the fire of any real Warmongers left in the complex.\nSHEPHERD: Without risk to himself.\nDOCTOR: Whilst they’re shooting at him, we can get out of the line of fire...\nSHEPHERD: And leave him to finish them off. Brilliant.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nMATTHEW: And is he okay with that?\nLASER: Are you asking me to fight something?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 121\nLASER: Then I’m okay with it.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Then let us proceed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: (KRARN AND KRARN 3 WALKING DOWN A CORRIDOR, WARMONGERS\nSURROUNDING: THEM)\nKRARN: I believe there are ways out of this place and into the wider universe —\nKRARN: 3 This dimension has worlds we have not yet conquered?\nKRARN: To a potentially endless degree —\nKRARN: 3 Wait — is that not more Warmongers coming this way?\nKRARN: Yes. My personal retinue, the original batch. But why — ?\nKRARN: Stop. Where are you going?\nWARMONGER: Rop, shlip, donc.\nKRARN: You met me on the flight deck of a rather smelly spacecraft, where I ordered you to cease your murderous activities and return to our previous world? I gave no such order.\nWARMONGER: Runc! Manclaspal!\nKRARN: Do not question me!\nKRARN: 3 You would kill our own troops?\nKRARN: There are plenty more where he came from. Quiet, rabble!\nKRARN: So. It seems I have a facsimile. This brings a new complexion to the matter. I wonder who it is?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 123\nKRARN: (AWAY) Return to your work.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Ah, it would appear our deception has been discovered. Sooner than I’d hoped.\nKRARN: 3 (AWAY) What should we do about this imposter?\nKRARN: (AWAY) Same as the others. Destroy him.\nMATTHEW: Doctor, is it my imagination or is there two of me, er, him now?\nCHIMBLY: And lots more of us.\nDOCTOR: Shepherd, talk to me.\nSHEPHERD: He must be running the other copies of ‘Laser’ through the machine. Each has its own Krarn, its own set of Warmongers.\nLASER: And its own me?\nDOCTOR: I imagine he’s being selective about who he lets out.\nLASER: But it’s easy. Couple more Nick Lasers around here, we could clean this place up in thirty minutes.\nDOCTOR: That’s not the plan. We need to prevent more cross-pollination of realities, not encourage it. Though the duplication process has given us one advantage.\nCHIMBLY: What? There must be, like, hundreds of those nutjobs now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 124\nDOCTOR: If there are multiple variants of Krarn and his cronies at large around Transmission, then it will hardly come as a surprise if they encounter other examples.\nSHEPHERD: We can hide in plain sight.\nDOCTOR: Precisely! The traditional prisoner and escort routine, it’s practically old hat.\nSHEPHERD: Krarn’s old hat too, he’s bound to fall for it.\nMATTHEW: You want me to role-play?\nCHIMBLY: You want us to act our way through this?\nDOCTOR: For the sake of the universe, yes.\nMATTHEW: That’s a big audition.\nDOCTOR: The biggest in history.\nCHIMBLY: No pressure then...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: (KRARN AND THE WARMONGERS ARE SEARCHING THE SHIP, THROWING\nTHINGS: EVERYWHERE, RIPPING OPEN DOORS)\nKRARN: 3 Your minions were not wrong about the smell.\nKRARN: Halt!\nKRARN: This craft is empty. Our impersonator and his friends have eluded us.\nKRARN: 3 Curses!\nKRARN: No. It is not over yet. As you rightly say, this craft has a nauseating odour. It clings. The Warmongers should be able to detect a trail. Find where they went. Go to, my creatures. Let me know when a trace is found.\nKRARN: I will have no one steal my face. (BEAT) You look troubled.\nKRARN: 3\nKRARN: It is odd. This ship is in working order, yet they did not use\nKRARN: it to escape.\nKRARN: That is strange. I wonder why?\nKRARN: Ah.\nKRARN: 3 You have found the answer?\nKRARN: This world is locked down. You cannot open the docking bay without a special combination known only to — aha — one Augustus Scullop.\nKRARN: 3 A code we don’t have?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 126\nKRARN: He was a little busy dying to pass on such information. But we do have our universal code-breaker.\nKRARN: 3 Indeed. I’1ll get to work.\nKRARN: Do. This pitiful spheroid bores me. There are so many more beings out there we could kill. So much pointless destruction we could wreak. How long will it take?\nKRARN: 3 There are over five hundred billion permutations to go through. Say twenty minutes?\nKRARN: Excellent. I shall use the time mopping up survivors and destroying our false friend. Then we shall depart this place. Leave my first copy to generate his own replacement, and then his own and then his own — a never-ending chain of death.\nKRARN: Ah. The trail is found. I must depart.\nKRARN: 3 Happy hunting.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 127\nSHEPHERD: The recording room’s right round this corner.\nDOCTOR: Wonderful. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, so close.\nCHIMBLY: Knew it was too good to be true.\nLASER: I can take them.\nDOCTOR: It’s not worth the risk.\nWARMONGER: Drobla-shublra!\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN)\nMATTHEW: Er. Hello there. Good to see you again. Looking well. I’m dealing with some prisoners here. Prisoner and escort. That sort of thing. You know the drill. One of the other... me’s said I should. Told me to do it. So that’s what I’m doing. That’s what I’m like. And you’re not to interfere. Right. Got that?\nWARMONGER: Fombla-numplena!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I think they want you to answer them.\nMATTHEW: (SOTTO) But I’ve no idea what they said.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Then take a wild stab in the dark.\nWARMONGER: Fombla-numplena! Fombla-numplena!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 128\nMATTHEW: Um... yes?\nWARMONGER: Drambla-patana!\nMATTHEW: (SOTTO) I think I guessed wrong.\nLASER: Looks like this is my department! Bring it on you walking bacon rashers!\nDOCTOR: How many pork products does that man know?\nSHEPHERD: Doctor, quick, while he’s got them busy...\nDOCTOR: The recording room, yes, right behind you. Come on.\nLASER: What are you? Smoked? Or unsmoked?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 129\nMATTHEW: We going to leave him out there?\nDOCTOR: He'll be fine. You lot, Porcians, watch the door.\nDOCTOR: CHIMBLY/ JUNIOR Right/Okay.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Shepherd, can you show me one of these cameras?\nSHEPHERD: It’s over here.\nDOCTOR: Do you know how to operate it?\nSHEPHERD: I developed the system, I’m an expert.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then I need you to get recording. Matthew.\nMATTHEW: What are we doing?\nDOCTOR: Krarn’s so deadly and powerful because whatever device or weapon the programme has given him — no matter how implausible or scientifically insane they might be — it is born into existence via the reality generator. Why don’t we turn that power against him?\nMATTHEW: I don’t follow.\nSHEPHERD: You want us to create ludicrous weapons of our own?\nDOCTOR: We can’t stop Krarn and the Warmongers with anything from our reality, the only place we’ll find something we can is in the bubble dimension! The more demented and all-encompasing the better.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 130\nMATTHEW: Such as?\nDOCTOR: Why don’t we go the whole hog, if you’1ll pardon the expression. No offence.\nCHIMBLY: None taken.\nDOCTOR: An anti-fiction-but-reality-unaffecting bomb.\nSHEPHERD: That’s ridiculous.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. A device that would wipe out everything imaginary within its blast radius.\nSHEPHERD: But... but that would take out Laser too.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And I’m sorry for that. But he isn’t really real and I have to reserve my concern for the people who actually exist.\nMATTHEW: How do we do it?\nDOCTOR: We film a new scene with you, Matthew, then splice it into the existing recording. The programme’s reality will adjust to accommodate the insert, then we collect the bomb from within the film and detonate it.\nSHEPHERD: That should be possible.\nDOCTOR: Good. Let’s get on with it.\nMATTHEW: Does it matter I’m not in costume?\nSHEPHERD: And this isn’t a room from the show?\nDOCTOR: We write in an explanation, the fiction will absorb it somehow. What we do need, however, is something to play the role of the bomb.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 131\nSHEPHERD: Like what?\nMATTHEW: There’s nothing here that looks like one.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t have to look like one, as long as we say that’s what it is. It simply has to be something technological with a button we can press. (BEAT) Mister Chimbly?\nCHIMBLY: Er, yes?\nDOCTOR: When you copied the system files of Doctor Shepherd’s machine, what exactly did you copy them onto?\nCHIMBLY: No.\nDOCTOR: There were no noticeable devices aboard that tip you call a\nDOCTOR: Spacecraft, meaning you must still have whatever it was upon your piggy person.\nCHIMBLY: Not the data pad. It’s worth a fortune.\nDOCTOR: Worth your life?\nCHIMBLY: But you won’t give it back when you’re done!\nDOCTOR: I might. You don’t know that for certain.\nCHIMBLY: Alright, there you go.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. This is ideal.\nCHIMBLY: Are you going to give it back?\nDOCTOR: Of course not.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 132\nCHIMBLY: Great.\nDOCTOR: We'd better get on. Lights, camera. Action.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney\nKRARN: 3 Ah. There. Warmonger, to me.\nWARMONGER: Fangshla?\nKRARN: 3\nKRARN: Inform the original Lord Krarn the combination decoded.

Then the universe shall Go!\nKRARN: All must die.\nKRARN: Page 133\nKRARN: lock has been aboard the this place know its fate.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: (CAMERA EQUIPMENT RUNNING. THE DOCTOR AND MATTHEW ACTING OUT A SCENE )\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN) And who are you? Disturbing my off-duty relaxation in Laser's previously unmentioned meditation room?\nDOCTOR: Ah, I’m just the delivery boy.\nLASER: Well, that’s the Pepperoni brothers dealt with —\nCHIMBLY: Shh — they’re recording...\nDOCTOR: I believe you ordered this on the Internet? A fantasy nullifier? A device where with one press of this button you send out a pulse-wave destroying anything fictional generated in reality within a radius of five light years, no matter how invincible they may claim to be?\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN) Ah, yes. It will be most useful. In the event of me, er, ever meeting anyone like that.\nDOCTOR: If you would sign there, please. And there.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nKRARN: I shall put it down here. You may leave. You have pleased me well.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (BEAT) And cut.\nSHEPHERD: (SWITCHING OFF THE MACHINE) That was terrible.\nCHIMBLY: Bad acting, awful script.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 135\nDOCTOR: It won’t win any awards, but it’1ll serve its function. Doctor Shepherd, can you incorporate this footage into the existing programme?\nSHEPHERD: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Then when you have, make for the control room and run it through the reality generator. Take Laser and the Porcians with you for protection.\nLASER: Good!\nCHIMBLY: Don’t we get a say in that?\nDOCTOR: You’1l be in danger wherever you are, at least this way you’1ll be helping with the solution. I’1ll head for the screening room. Matthew, come with me. I’m sorry, but I may have to ask you to act me out of trouble.\nMATTHEW: Whatever you need.\nDOCTOR: Good man. I’1ll need to retrieve the device from inside the programme before we can detonate it.\nSHEPHERD: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because otherwise it’1ll wipe out the contents of the bubble and take me with it. I’d prefer to be alive when all this is sorted out if it’s all the same to you.\nSHEPHERD: It’ll be that powerful?\nDOCTOR: I said it would wipe out anything fictional in the recording, that’s precisely what it’1ll do. That’s how it works, the fiction becomes fact and the impossible becomes the actual. So\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: Is something the matter?\nDOCTOR: No. No, nothing’s the matter. Quite the opposite in fact. How long has it been since Krarn broke out?\nSHEPHERD: I don’t know, fifty minutes? Why?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) We need to redo the scene.\nMATTHEW: What?\nCHIMBLY: We don’t have to watch that rubbish again, do we?\nDOCTOR: We’re doing another take. But with one additional line of dialogue.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 137\nKRARN: My, the bodycount is rather high, isn’t it? You imbeciles. Thinking you could escape my justice. None may hide from the invincible Lord Krarn. Good work, my creatures.\nKRARN: Report.\nWARMONGER: Spubbla-rantampla!\nKRARN: It is ready. I see. Begin taking our forces on board. Wait for my return before you depart. Do it!\nKRARN: In the meantime, we will find and destroy he who dares to impersonate me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 138\nDOCTOR: This way, Matthew, come along.\nMATTHEW: Sorry. Getting a bit of a stitch...\nDOCTOR: Doctor Shepherd, are you there?\nSHEPHERD: (OVER COMMUNICATOR THROUGHOUT) Yes, receiving you.\nDOCTOR: Have you reached the control room?\nSHEPHERD: It was surprisingly easy. I reckon they’re leaving.\nDOCTOR: Krarn must have figured out a way around the code. We need to hurry. Did you insert the new footage?\nSHEPHERD: I’ve put it in the show, it’s ready to run.\nDOCTOR: We’re reaching the viewing room now, I’11 call you when we’re ready for you to start the screening. Out.\nDOCTOR: Here we are. After you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nKRARN: 2 My brother.\nMATTHEW: Er, hello.\nKRARN: 2\nKRARN: Page 139\nKRARN: I need no help with the duplications. Who is this?\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN)\nMATTHEW: Um, a special prisoner. I needed to show him the screening room as he might know a way of accelerating the process.\nKRARN: 2\nKRARN: Then our conquest would accelerate too?\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN) Pretty much, yeah.\nKRARN: 2 Then I approve of this plan.\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN)\nMATTHEW: You are to report to the docking bay.\nKRARN: 2 As you wish.\nMATTHEW: (AS KRARN) See you later.\nKRARN: 2 Yes.\nDOCTOR: That was worryingly close...\nMATTHEW: I will take over here.\nMATTHEW: Think I’m getting the hang of this now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 140\nDOCTOR: Don’t get complacent. Krarn is a force to be reckoned with, even if he is a trifle gullible. You need to buy me enough time to get in there, get the fantasy nullifier and get out again.\nMATTHEW: I’1ll try. Will you be long?\nDOCTOR: I've no idea. The programme will have rewritten itself to incorporate the meditation room we invented for our scene, but that really could be anywhere on Laser's ship. Let's hope I find it quickly, eh?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Shepherd, we're ready to go.\nSHEPHERD: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) Okay, starting the screening... now.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Wish me luck, Matthew, there’s bound to be more\nDOCTOR: Warmongers in there.\nSHEPHERD: (DISTORT) All the best.\nDOCTOR: You too. Here goes nothing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 141\nMATTHEW: (OVER COMMUNICATOR) He’s inside.\nSHEPHERD: Great. He’s cutting it awfully fine.\nLASER: Don’t worry. He’s a good guy. Good always triumphs over evil.\nSHEPHERD: I’m really not sure that’s true.\nLASER: He’1l do what it takes to stop Krarn.\nSHEPHERD: And that doesn’t bother you? The fact you’1ll be killed?\nLASER: I'll be what?\nSHEPHERD: If the Doctor’s plan works, you'll die.\nLASER: (SNORTS WITH LAUGHTER) I think you’re mistaken.\nSHEPHERD: Really?\nLASER: I don’t die. It’s not what I do. Death is something that happens to other people.\nCHIMBLY: If we could stop the metaphysical chit-chat for the moment —\nSHEPHERD: What is it?\nJUNIOR: Warmongers. Lots of them.\nSHEPHERD: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 142\nCHIMBLY: They’ve tracked us down.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 143\nKRARN: So this is where the trail ends, is it?\nWARMONGER: Rasplama-potento!\nKRARN: They have locked the door? But of course. Cut it open. Destroy them. I will return to the docking bay and supervise our departure.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 144\nCHIMBLY: What do we do, they’1ll kill us!\nLASER: You know you can leave them to me.\nSHEPHERD: That’s not the issue. We can’t open the door to let you out.\nLASER: Why not?\nSHEPHERD: The slightest damage to this machine could destroy it. One loose shot and the Doctor’s trapped inside the fictional reality forever! He won’t be able to save anyone.\nLASER: But the Warmongers are expert marksmen, there won’t be any loose shots.\nSHEPHERD: When they’re firing at you there’s nothing but. You’re the one thing they can’t hit.\nLASER: Ah.\nSHEPHERD: They get inside this room, they’re guaranteed to hit the machine even if they’re not aiming for it.\nCHIMBLY: So we can’t even risk opening the door? We’ve got to prevent them getting in here at all?\nSHEPHERD: Yes. And if they do —\nCHIMBLY: We have to act as shields.\nSHEPHERD: Anything to keep the machine running.\nCHIMBLY: Junior?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 145\nJUNIOR: Yes, dad?\nCHIMBLY: The next time I come up with one of these plans can you remind me to forget it?\nJUNIOR: Yes dad.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 146\nKRARN: Stop, you there!\nKRARN: 2 Ah, my brother.\nKRARN: Why have you abandoned your post in the screening room?\nKRARN: 2 My — ?\nKRARN: You were to stay and supervise the duplication process.\nKRARN: 2 I.. You instructed me to leave.\nKRARN: I gave no such order.\nKRARN: 2 Then one of us did.\nKRARN: The other Krarn is accounted for, he would not — (BEAT) The imposter. It must be he. Of course. What was he doing? This other Krarn, what was he doing?\nKRARN: 2 He had a prisoner with him who was going to accelerate the process.\nKRARN: I do not like the sound of this. He is up to something. (BEAT) Join my Warmongers. They are that way. In the meantime... I think I shall deal with our handsome friend...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 147\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Now if I was a meditation room, where would I be? Here, probably.\nDOCTOR: Aha! Excellent! The finely honed instincts of the superior brain. And the nullifier right where he left it as well.\nWARMONGER: That didn’t sound good. Still. Only one more thing to collect and then I can depart this reality...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 148\nMATTHEW: Okay, relax, just relax. Maybe a bit of Alexander technique.\nKRARN: Ah. As I thought.\nMATTHEW: Oh, crikey, er, hello, fellow Krarn, it is I, your duplicate —\nKRARN: Do you think me a fool?\nMATTHEW: That... that.. really hurts...\nKRARN: Who are you? What are you after?\nMATTHEW: (WEAKLY) Doctor!\nKRARN: There are no medics for you, my friend.\nMATTHEW: Please, Doctor, help me!\nMATTHEW: Oh, that’s my teeth...\nKRARN: Of course. You must be the one who portrayed me in the\nKRARN: recording. Bet you regret that now. What are you up to?\nMATTHEW: I can’t, I mustn’t —\nKRARN: Where’s the person you were with? What are you trying to do?\nMATTHEW: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 149\nKRARN: Answer me!\nMATTHEW: I won’t!\nMATTHEW: (KRARN HITS HIM REPEATEDLY,\nKRARN: You — will — tell — me!\nMATTHEW: =\nKRARN: Oh, what’s the point?\nEMPHASISING: HIS WORDS)\nEMPHASISING: You were waiting for someone... hmm. Your clothes. (SNORTS) You know, I think we’re the same size...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE LASER TOOL IS CUTTING THROUGH THE DOOR. GROWLS FROM BEHIND THE DOOR)\nCHIMBLY: How long do you reckon we’ve got?\nSHEPHERD: Before they cut through? A minute, maybe less.\nLASER: You ready for a last stand?\nCHIMBLY: Not exactly. You know Junior...\nJUNIOR: Yes, dad?\nCHIMBLY: I almost hope we die here today.\nJUNIOR: What? Why?\nCHIMBLY: Cos if we get home your mum is going to kill me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 151\nKRARN: Excellent. A perfect fit!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING FROM INSIDE THE PROGRAMME) Matthew!\nKRARN: (TO HIMSELF) Is that my name?\nKRARN: (THE DOCTOR STEPS OUT OF THE PROGRAMME, HIS VOICE DISTORTING\nSLIGHTLY: AS HE DOES)\nDOCTOR: Oh, good, you’re still safe.\nKRARN: (AS MATTHEW) Yes. I am.\nDOCTOR: I retrieved the device with almost childish ease. One press of this button and both Krarn and his repellent army will be erased from reality completely.\nKRARN: (AS MATTHEW) It will? May I do it?\nDOCTOR: You?\nKRARN: (AS MATTHEW) I feel it would be my duty.\nDOCTOR: A surprisingly bloodthirsty attitude from you, Matthew, but I don’t see why not. Here you go.\nDOCTOR: Though if you could wait a few seconds, because —\nDOCTOR: Careful! That’s an incredibly delicate piece of machinery!\nKRARN: A piece of machinery you will not now be able to use.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 152\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nKRARN: That’s the trouble with impersonating your foe. It is a technique that works both ways.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) What have you done with Matthew?\nKRARN: His blasphemous corpse is in the corridor.\nDOCTOR: No!\nKRARN: He is like that worm Scullop, is he not? He bears responsibility for his own demise. I seem to be killing all my creators today. If he had wanted to live he should not have been complicit in my pain.\nDOCTOR: It was unnecessary.\nKRARN: Nothing I do is necessary. Killing you is not necessary. But I’m still going to do it.\nDOCTOR: Are you?\nKRARN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Only you’ve your back to the bubble world. It would be quite easy for someone to step out of that, pick up the fantasy nullifier and wipe you from this dimension entirely.\nKRARN: There is no one in that place that can save you.\nDOCTOR: Is there not? You don’t want to look behind you?\nKRARN: I have fallen for that trick before. There is no-one behind me.\nDOCTOR: I thought you wouldn’t believe me. Very well. As you wish. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. The button on the top, Flip.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 153\nFLIP: (BEHIND KRARN) Right you are, Doctor.\nKRARN: Who the devil — ?\nKRARN: (FLIP PRESSES THE BUTTON. A PULSE OF ENERGY BLASTS OUT,\nTEARING: KRARN APART — HE YELLS IN PAIN, IF POSSIBLE WITH THE\nWILHELM: SCREAM)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 154\nSHEPHERD: They’re through!\nKRARN: 2 Kill them, my beauties!\nCHIMBLY: No!\nCHIMBLY: (THE WARMONGERS CHARGE IN, BUT AS THEY DO, THE PULSE SWEEPS ACROSS THE ROOM)\nKRARN: 2 What on —\nLASER: Ah! It hurts, it —\nKRARN: 2 No! The pain, no!\nSHEPHERD: I’m sorry, Jack.\nLASER: What is this, is this — ?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 155\nFLIP: Wow. He’s looking pretty much gone.\nDOCTOR: His body is being destroyed. The fiction he’s derived from is being erased from reality.\nFLIP: Right. So, out of curiosity... what did I just do?\nDOCTOR: Well, Flip, you just saved the universe.\nFLIP: Cool. Excellent, always wanted to do that.\nDOCTOR: Excellent and cool, indeed.\nFLIP: Yeah. (BEAT) On a related note, why aren’t I dead?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 156\nSHEPHERD: Yes, if you could take that piece outside. It needs to go straight to the incinerator.\nWORKMAN: Right, miss.\nSHEPHERD: Ah, there you are. Wondering when you’d show your face.\nDOCTOR: Thought I’d see how it was going.\nSHEPHERD: Going’s the operative word. My entire life’s work’s being dismantled in front of my eyes. I’ve destroyed all the blueprints and computer files. Drexel’s swooped in and bought up what remains of the company. The share price was at an all time low.\nDOCTOR: Hardly surprising.\nSHEPHERD: Didn’t want him getting hold of this. Who knows where he’d stop.\nDOCTOR: We can’t let it be used again. It’s too dangerous.\nSHEPHERD: I understand.\nDOCTOR: A shame this revelation came so late.\nSHEPHERD: I know. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: You’ve said that an awful lot, Doctor Shepherd. Sometimes it just isn’t good enough.\nSHEPHERD: What? What do you think I should I have done?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 157\nDOCTOR: Behaved responsibly in the first place? Science isn’t a plaything. A toy. It’s the fundamental structure of the universe. If you’re going to interfere with reality itself, you’d better know what you’re doing and you’d better have a good reason. You didn’t. On either count.\nSHEPHERD: No.\nDOCTOR: So the results must weigh on your conscience.\nSHEPHERD: Yes. Everyone in the production dead.\nDOCTOR: Not quite everyone. The Porcians survived. Got out of here as quickly as they could, mind you.\nSHEPHERD: You think they’re going to change their ways?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. Nearly causing the genocide of their own race several times over hasn’t given them the slightest pause, I’m sure this won’t trouble them much in the long term. But hope springs eternal. It wasn’t just them either, I found another survivor.\nSHEPHERD: Who?\nDOCTOR: A gentleman by the name of Nick?\nSHEPHERD: Oh, no.\nDOCTOR: The actor who played Laser, yes? He hid in the toilets through the whole affair. Hardly the action hero his counterpart was.\nSHEPHERD: Not quite.\nDOCTOR: But then who really is a hero in this day and age? Goodbye.\nSHEPHERD: Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor. Look after Flip.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 158\nDOCTOR: Oh, I intend to. Be careful with television in the future. Fiction has power, Doctor Shepherd. Remember that.\nSHEPHERD: Yes. (BEAT) Right, can you put that bit over there —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 159\nDOCTOR WHO: (FLIP EATING POPCORN, WATCHING THE DOCTOR AND MATTHEW ON THE VISUALISER)\nDOCTOR: If you could sign here.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nKRARN: I’1ll put it over here. You can leave. I’m pleased with your work.\nDOCTOR: Before TI go...\nKRARN: Yes?\nDOCTOR: You do realise that gun of yours is faulty? If you shoot anyone with it, it’ll make them look like they’ve died, blood everywhere, no breath, no pulse, nothing... but it won’t actually have killed them.\nFLIP: Oh, that is ludicrous, who’s going to believe that?\nDOCTOR: They’ll come back to life an hour later with no ill effects as if absolutely nothing has happened.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nKRARN: I am aware of that.\nFLIP: Oops.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t mind me, what were you watching?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 160\nFLIP: The footage you inserted into the film. You know. The bit that brought me back to life.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. That.\nFLIP: I know, I know, we have to destroy all copies, but I... wanted to see it once.\nDOCTOR: Very clever, wasn’t it? The reality generator could alter all reality in the bubble to fit the fiction, even to the degree of rewriting history. I’m surprised it took me so long to work at out.\nFLIP: But only in the bubble?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Which is why the gun still killed those on the outside. You were very lucky Doctor Shepherd persuaded me to leave you in there. The idea wouldn’t have worked otherwise.\nFLIP: Feel guilty though. So many other people died. Yet I’m the one that gets to come back.\nDOCTOR: I know. But I can’t save everyone. (BEAT. QUIETLY) Don’t do that to me again.\nFLIP: sorry.\nDOCTOR: What you did was very foolish. I can’t keep you around if you’re going to take risks like that all the time.\nFLIP: I’m not going to change who I am.\nDOCTOR: I know. And I wouldn’t want you to. Just... just be careful. For me. Travelling with me is dangerous. I’m not always this fortunate.\nFLIP: Nonsense, you’re well lucky, you get to hang out with me all the time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 161\nDOCTOR: So how shall we celebrate your resurrection? What would you like to see, where shall we go?\nFLIP: Do we have to go anywhere? Doctor, I’m knackered. I spent the whole day as a corpse, really knocks it out of you.\nDOCTOR: So what would you suggest?\nFLIP: Can that food machine do take-out?\nDOCTOR: A rough equivalent.\nFLIP: Great. Then mine’s a Chinese. What’s on TV?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 162\nWILDTRACK: FOR SCENE 3: CRICKET COMMENTARY\nWILDTRACK: (THESE LINES AREN’T CUE TO CUE. THEY'RE SPLIT UP UNDER THE SCENE )\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 Obviously, Australia are in a good mood today, two nil down to two all in the series. Bringing it all to play for.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2\nCOMMENTATOR: They’re off. What a well placed shot. Timed to perfection. Yeah, that’s going to relax Gilchrist. Not a major push forward, just a little prod. Four on the board.\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 Amazing ball to the offside there. That’s how he likes to\nCOMMENTATOR: play.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 Oh, that’s a shame there. Not quite far enough. But ten to the over, twenty-three for none it remains.\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 Beautifully played straight four there. Right down the line.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 Oh, and he’s found the gap there. Through for four.\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 It’s a lovely day here. It’s a capacity crowd today, thirty two thousand. All excited by this amazing day’s cricket.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 Perfect cricketing weather as well. Not a drop of rain forecast.\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 He doesn’t seem very happy with the bat there. Been doing him well though, that’s a surprise.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 Oh, he’s all over the shop, that’s yet another boundary. Gilchrist was always going to take advantage of those.\nCOMMENTATOR: 1\nCOMMENTATOR: Oh, some debate on that ball there. Lucky to have got away with that one, I’m sure a lot of people would have counted that as wide. He could have been in trouble there. He was\nCOMMENTATOR: lucky to catch the edge of it. Didn’t get in more trouble.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 28 runs from 20 balls, a good average.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FOURTH WALL by John Dorney Page 163\nCOMMENTATOR: 1 Three boundaries in four balls, he’s trying to avoid bowling too straight.\nCOMMENTATOR: 2 He’s played a pull shot there, that’s one of his favourites."
