I would have thought you’d all be far more interested in the Olympics.\nBARSET: I’m flattered and somewhat surprised by your enthusiasm and interest, but without you and your readers and audiences, I doubt I’d be here today. And thanks to you all, and the awareness you have raised, the Commission has granted me this licence for the expedition.\nBARSET: This licence gives us all the chance to honour my grandfather’s lost Antarctic expedition. It will not only enable us to discover what fate befell him and his faithful team back in 1929. It, perhaps most importantly, affords us the opportunity to pay our last respects and lay their remains to rest.\nBARSET: I never met my old grandpa, but through reading his diaries and through the family stories past down the years, I feel he’s been with me all my life. I hereby declare my mission to find the lost Antarctic expedition of Lord Barset!\nHARMAN: [OC]: Main base to dig site. Do you read? Over. Main base to dig site. Over. Dig site! Prof! Come in, for God’s sake.\nHARMAN: Still nothing. Sorry, sir. I just don’t understand.\nBARSET: All right. All right, Harman. Let’s keep it calm. We must be pretty close now. We'll know soon enough what’s happened.\nMAN: There’s the dig site up ahead, sir.\nBARSET: Can’t see anyone.\nHARMAN: Maybe they’re all underground.\nBARSET: Maybe. Maybe.\nMCINTYRE: All right, shut her down.\nGENEVIEVE: That’s taken the ice back about another ten feet.\nMCINTYRE: Get the water mopped up. It'll freeze in no time, and then we'll be skating on our backsides.\nBEN: Sir. Come on, move it, lads.\nMCINTYRE: Still can’t see anything. Nothing. Is the reading still there?\nGENEVIEVE: Of course. See for yourself. Sonic triangulations still confirm.\nMCINTYRE: Not that big, is it? Must be some kind of fragment.\nGENEVIEVE: Reads over two metres tall. Looks cuboid. Part of a structure, maybe.\nBEN: Professor. Prof! Come and look.\nMCINTYRE: What is it?\nGENEVIEVE: There, you see?\nMCINTYRE: I can see the ice cracking, but... oh, my word.\nGENEVIEVE: About two metres tall, wouldn’t you say, Professor?\nMCINTYRE: Well, yes, I would.\nBEN: Look out!\nGENEVIEVE: Professor. Mac, are you all right?\nMCINTYRE: Just bruises I think, my dear. Oh.\nGENEVIEVE: Take it easy. Ben, everything okay with your people?\nBEN: All okay, mademoiselle. You sure you’re all right?\nGENEVIEVE: Yes, yes, of course. More shock than anything else. We melted more than we thought, it would seem. The ice must have just given way in there. The thing shifted, and well, er...\nMCINTYRE: What is it? What have we got?\nGENEVIEVE: I don’t understand. There’s... there’s script on it. English. What does it say?\nMCINTYRE: It is... I don’t... You’ve never seen one of these things, have you, Genevieve?\nGENEVIEVE: Seen one? No. You have?\nMCINTYRE: Oh, a long time ago. Look, read it.\nGENEVIEVE: Police Box.\nMCINTYRE: Buried in ice that’s been here for millions of years. An old London Police Box.\nDOCTOR: Good, good. That should do it. Right. (running) Ah! Hello. Fancy meeting you here. No! No, don't!\nDOCTOR: You idiot! Look what you’ve done!\nHARMON: All right, lads. Let’s not take any chances. Lock and load.\nBARSET: Nobody fires unless I give the word, is that clear?\nHARMON: Of course, sir.\nBARSET: Right. Well, let’s see what ancient terrors McIntyre has unleashed, shall we?\nHARMAN: What?\nBARSET: Just joking, Harman. Just joking. Come on.\nGENEVIEVE: And English policemen used to live in these?\nMCINTYRE: No, no, not live. It was just, I don’t know, a place they could go.\nGENEVIEVE: Go? And did any of them ever go to the Antarctic in such a police box?\nMCINTYRE: Look, Jenny, I’m just as baffled as you are.\nGENEVIEVE: Perhaps we should try to get it open. I think I’ve found the door.\nMCINTYRE: What? What’s going on?\nGENEVIEVE: In fact, there’s a key.\nHARMON: All right, nobody move. What’s going on?\nBEN: Blimey, Captain, no need to shoot anyone.\nHARMON: Mouth shut, Ben.\nMCINTYRE: How dare you burst in here like this, Captain. I demand to know what the meaning is.\nBARSET: The meaning, Professor Mcintyre, is that we lost all radio contact with you six days ago. I think you’d agree that that was cause for concern.\nMCINTYRE: Well, er, perhaps. But not cause for all this, this melodramatic militaristic nonsense. What the devil were you expecting to find down here?\nBARSET: And what the devil prevented you from making radio contact with the Fortitude?\nMCINTYRE: Ah, well, there’s been some sort of\nGENEVIEVE: Professor, there’s something else. Come and look.\nBARSET: What the hell’s that thing? It looks like a\nGENEVIEVE: Not that. Mac, I thought I caught sight of something else.\nMCINTYRE: Something else?\nBARSET: Like what? Can you find it on your computer imaging\nGENEVIEVE: I’m just checking it on the ice probes now.\nMCINTYRE: Two finds in one day. Remarkable.\nBARSET: Well, is there something? Let me see that. That... that’s incredible.\nMCINTYRE: Genevieve, are you sure that’s a true reading?\nGENEVIEVE: Positive.\nBEN: Looks like... like the shape of a man. An ice man.\nDOCTOR: What’s happening? I was drowning. Now everything’s so still (echoes). Where am I going?\nGENEVIEVE: That’s it. Be careful. Bring it over here.\nBEN: Come on, lads, keep a grip on it. On that table, mademoiselle?\nGENEVIEVE: Thank you, Ben, yes. Good, good. Okay, if you could wheel those heat emitters over here.\nBEN: Sure. Bailey, get the other one, will you?\nBAILEY: Yeah, sure.\nGENEVIEVE: Now.\nBEN: What have you got there, mademoiselle? What are them tubes for?\nGENEVIEVE: Well, our friend here had a lot of er, well, I suppose you’d call it sediment frozen with him. I'll set the emitters to minimum, so as the ice melts and he slowly thaws, we can gently wash away all this er\nBEN: Muck. That’s what it looks like. Looks like the poor bloke was rolling in a barrel of mud before he got frozen.\nGENEVIEVE: Well, we don’t know what happened to him or her. We only know one thing.\nBEN: What, that he’s a policeman, judging by that box?\nGENEVIEVE: I was going to say that all we know is that this body is millions of years old, but I suppose the truth is that er, we don’t know anything about him at all.\nBEN: Right lads, we’re needed back in the cavern. Come on, let’s get a move on. You gonna be all right, Miss?\nGENEVIEVE: Hmm? Oh, sure, yes.\nBEN: Could make you a cup of coffee if you'd like.\nGENEVIEVE: Er, I’m okay, thanks, Ben. It was a nice thought but your coffee is frankly disgusting.\nBEN: Suit yourself. So you don’t mind being left alone with, you know, the mystery man there.\nGENEVIEVE: Of course not. This is a fantastic opportunity to er, to\nBEN: Okay. It’s just that you looked a bit spooked, that’s all.\nGENEVIEVE: Hmm, well, maybe I like being spooked. Maybe that’s why I’m here. Why are you here, Ben?\nBEN: Pay’s good. What were you and the Prof expecting to find here, if you don’t mind me asking?\nGENEVIEVE: Oh, I don’t mind, no. But you’re asking the wrong person. I’m as much a hired hand as you, Ben. The Professor and Lord Barset have their own agenda.\nMCINTYRE: So what is it?\nBARSET: You’re the archaeologist.\nMCINTYRE: Yes, I’m a archaeologist, not a fool. You promised me unusual artefacts and remains, not an impossibly preserved body buried in a layer of ice frozen millions of years ago.\nBARSET: Doesn't that qualify, McIntyre? Aren’t you excited?\nMCINTYRE: You know something, don’t you. You know something you’re not telling me.\nBARSET: Oh, come on, Mac, you’ve always suspected I’ve known something, haven’t you? You were just far to grateful to be here to think of asking, until now.\nMCINTYRE: I... I’m afraid I don’t Know what you mean.\nBARSET: Oh, you can fool yourself, but you can’t fool me. You saw the licence I was granted for this expedition, didn’t you?\nMCINTYRE: Well, yes, of course. I insisted.\nBARSET: That’s right. You insisted. Starchy old Kelvin Mcintyre, his career all dried up, insisted on doing everything by the book.\nMCINTYRE: If you thought I was dried up, why did you\nBARSET: Because you’ve a passion to prove yourself. You’re brilliant, but no one was taking any notice of you any more. Very frustrating. You saw the licence and you knew I’d been granted it on the basis we’d be here to recover the remains of my grandfather’s lost expedition. A heritage mission, to recover the recent past.\nMCINTYRE: Yes. Of course.\nBARSET: No mention of archaeology on that licence, was there? You’ve known there was something cloak- and-dagger about this all along. Admit it.\nMCINTYRE: Why the guns, Barset? What have we found in the ice? What were you expecting to find?\nGENEVIEVE: [OC]: Professor?\nMCINTYRE: What is it, Genevieve?\nGENEVIEVE: [OC]: You’d better come and look.\nBARSET: Has it thawed? Well? Is it reptilian?\nMCINTYRE: Reptilian?\nGENEVIEVE: You'd better close the door.\nBARSET: Professor. All right, Jenny my dear, get the sheet off it. Stop teasing us. Oh.\nGENEVIEVE: What were you expecting, your Lordship?\nBARSET: A man.\nGENEVIEVE: Perfectly preserved. Clothes mostly rotted, but he was clothed, and the cloth looks like it was machine-woven.\nMCINTYRE: It’s impossible enough that you’ve found a man who shouldn’t have existed millions of years ago. Now you’re suggesting his clothes were manufactured.\nGENEVIEVE: Take a look for yourself, Mac. And I’ve just done a full medical scan. Should be rendered by now. Oh my.\nBARSET: What is it? What’s the matter?\nMCINTYRE: He may look human, but there’s very little about his internal organs that I’d recognise as human. Why is he so perfectly preserved, Jenny?\nGENEVIEVE: The ice, I guess. He probably drowned, the water freezing almost immediately after he died. Then the corpse could have accumulated layers of silt and sediment over the centuries without... wait a minute. I don’t believe it.\nMCINTYRE: Barset, what did you mean when you asked if it was reptilian?\nBARSET: Did I say that?\nGENEVIEVE: There’s nothing wrong with the scan.\nMCINTYRE: I thought there must be something wrong with the... I think I should take a sample for DNA analysis. Any objections?\nBARSET: No, you do your job, Jenny my love.\nGENEVIEVE: With this extraordinary level of preservation, there could even be some blood. Hmm. Maybe if I just.\nDOCTOR: Ow!\nGENEVIEVE: I don't believe it!\nBARSET: That’s not possible!\nGENEVIEVE: How can he be alive?\nDOCTOR: Am I alive?\nMCINTYRE: He can speak English.\nDOCTOR: English? Of course I can speak... What's that noise?\nBARSET: Come in, Harman.\nHARMAN: [OC]: This is Harman, sir.\nBARSET: Get to the lab now, and make sure you’re armed.\nMCINTYRE: I hardly think this man is dangerous.\nBARSET: I hardly think you know what you’re talking about, old man.\nGENEVIEVE: And he’s certainly not a reptile, your Lordship.\nMCINTYRE: Yes. Why exactly did you think that?\nDOCTOR: Where am I?\nBARSET: Get in here, Harman.\nHARMAN: Sir. Who the hell? Is that what we found?\nBARSET: Never mind the questions, Captain. Just draw your weapon and keep a close eye on him.\nDOCTOR: You think I’m going to hurt you?\nMCINTYRE: Who are you? How did you get in the ice?\nDOCTOR: Ice? Oh yes, I am rather cold.\nGENEVIEVE: Here, let me wrap this around you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Ace.\nGENEVIEVE: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, sorry. Wires crossed. There’s a noise in my head.\nHARMAN: Harman here. Go ahead.\nBEN: [OC]: Captain, it’s Ben. There’s something I think people will probably want to see down here.\nHARMAN: What, exactly?\nBARSET: Give me that. What are you talking about, Ben?\nBEN: [OC]: The emitters have melted something else out of the ice. Something pretty... oh, I don’t know... weird.\nMCINTYRE: You reactivated the emitters without my permission?\nBARSET: Permission? I don’t need your permission to do anything, Mac. I’m the one who’s paying for everything.\nMCINTYRE: Unsupervised melting could cause flooding and potential damage to any possible finds.\nBARSET: Well, you’d better come and supervise, then, Professor. Jenny, you stay here and look after our mystery man. Make him a nice cup of cocoa, something like that, love.\nGENEVIEVE: I knew there was a reason I studied physics.\nBARSET: Professor, Captain, with me.\nDOCTOR: He seemed unpleasant.\nGENEVIEVE: He’s our boss. It’s his money behind this expedition.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Money talks.\nGENEVIEVE: What about you? Do you talk?\nDOCTOR: Evidently. Expedition to where?\nGENEVIEVE: Antarctica.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Earth. Yes.\nGENEVIEVE: Earth?\nDOCTOR: This is Earth, isn’t it?\nGENEVIEVE: Er, yes, of course.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think there’s an Antarctica anywhere else.\nGENEVIEVE: Why did you call me Ace?\nDOCTOR: Ace, Mel, Hex. I thought... But I’m alone. I remember that.\nGENEVIEVE: What else do you remember?\nDOCTOR: They fired.\nGENEVIEVE: Who fired?\nDOCTOR: Blasted through the walls, water flooding in.\nGENEVIEVE: When did this happen?\nDOCTOR: What year is this?\nGENEVIEVE: What year? It’s 2012. You were frozen in the ice.\nDOCTOR: 2012. Then it was millions of years ago.\nGENEVIEVE: Who the hell are you?\nDOCTOR: I don’t remember. Who are you?\nMCINTYRE: Turn those emitters off, Ben. They’re set far too high.\nBEN: Right, Prof.\nBARSET: Leave them on, Ben.\nMCINTYRE: The place will be flooded if you carry on like\nBARSET: Harman, get something done about this water.\nHARMAN: I don’t follow what you mean.\nBARSET: Get some men and mop it up, you idiot.\nHARMAN: All right, sir. Yes, sir.\nBARSET: Well, well, well. Would you look at that, Professor McIntyre.\nBEN: What are they? We reckon there’s about twenty of them.\nBARSET: Yeah, twenty seems about right.\nMCINTYRE: Still quite far back in the ice.\nBARSET: Well?\nMCINTYRE: Is this what you were expecting, Barset?\nBARSET: Perhaps.\nMCINTYRE: What is it you know? It’s to do with your grandfather’s expedition, isn’t it, back in 1929.\nBARSET: Yes.\nMCINTYRE: But no one returned from that expedition. That’s why we’re supposedly here, to find their remains and give them a decent\nBARSET: There was one survivor, actually.\nMCINTYRE: What? But...\nBARSET: The family kept it secret.\nMCINTYRE: Why? Who was he?\nBARSET: Oh, I don’t know. Just some crew member. Apparently he’d gone stark staring mad. Doesn’t matter who he was. He died just a few days after being found. It’s what he had with him that’s important.\nBEN: What was that then, your Lordship?\nBARSET: Find a mop and get on with some work, Hodgson.\nBEN: Sorry, sir.\nMCINTYRE: Well?\nBARSET: He had in his possession my grandfather’s expedition diary.\nMCINTYRE: But there was no record of\nBARSET: It’s been passed down to me. And there isn’t a soul left alive today who’s read it, except for me, of course.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Oh, that’s much warmer. Oh, thank you, er...\nGENEVIEVE: Geneviéve. Genevieve (English pronunciation).\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s a very beautiful name. Genevieve. Genevieve.\nGENEVIEVE: I know. I get told that a lot. You get extra points for being French, you know.\nDOCTOR: Extra? I’m not sure I know what you mean.\nGENEVIEVE: Never mind. Here, drink this.\nDOCTOR: Ah, cocoa. How kind.\nGENEVIEVE: I thought so. I’m glad you like it.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s lovely. What are you staring at?\nGENEVIEVE: You.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Why?\nGENEVIEVE: Where do we begin? What is the first question?\nDOCTOR: Will I ever find an answer? Did you hear that?\nGENEVIEVE: Hear what?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. It’s gone now. It sounds... something I remember. Something (whispers)\nGENEVIEVE: How come someone fired at you millions of years ago?\nDOCTOR: Did I say that? Oh yes. I remember saying that. I think.\nGENEVIEVE: Yes?\nBARSET: [OC]: Get down here, Jenny. We need you and your scanners.\nGENEVIEVE: Why?\nMCINTYRE: [OC]: Genevieve, there are creatures in the ice down here.\nDOCTOR: Creatures?\nGENEVIEVE: I’m on my way. You, er, stay here. Drink some more cocoa.\nDOCTOR: No.\nGENEVIEVE: I thought you liked it.\nDOCTOR: I'll bring it with me.\nGENEVIEVE: No, you can’t. You’re er... I mean er... you may not be well enough. You should rest.\nDOCTOR: Where are you going?\nGENEVIEVE: The ice cavern.\nDOCTOR: Where you found me?\nGENEVIEVE: Er, well, yes.\nDOCTOR: Then I think I’m going to have to insist on coming with you.\nGENEVIEVE: Insist?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think so. In fact, definitely. I’m insisting. Lead the way, er...\nGENEVIEVE: Genevieve.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Beautiful name. (whispers)\nGENEVIEVE: Come on.\nMCINTYRE: My God, it’s reptilian. This is what you were expecting, isn’t it, Barset?\nBARSET: Reptilian, indigenous to Earth, predating human civilisation.\nHARMAN: What are you talking about, your Lordship? What on Earth is this thing?\nMCINTYRE: He’s quoting from his grandfather’s diary, aren’t you.\nBARSET: I’ve always known I had to come here. Are you glad you came, Mac? This is going to make us rich.\nMCINTYRE: Rich?\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nBARSET: I didn’t say to bring him.\nGENEVIEVE: He insisted.\nDOCTOR: A blue box. Hmm.\nGENEVIEVE: We found it just before we found you.\nDOCTOR: Police Box.\nMCINTYRE: Does it mean anything to you?\nDOCTOR: Did anyone hear that?\nBARSET: Hear what? No. Someone take him back to the lab and make him... lie down or something. He’s clearly not right in the head.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but you. I remember something about you.\nBARSET: Me?\nBEN: He’s looking at that thing.\nGENEVIEVE: Reptilian. Is this what you were expecting before, your Lordship?\nDOCTOR: You.\nBARSET: It’s dead, you fool. Stop talking to it. Ben, take this madman back to the lab.\nDOCTOR: Was I dead?\nBARSET: What? What’s he talking about?\nMCINTYRE: You mean this creature is going to wake up, like you did.\nDOCTOR: Yes. They all are. And it'll be your fault.\nMCINTYRE: Fault? But this creature must be millions of years old.\nDOCTOR: Like me?\nBEN: Nothing like you, is it. I mean, it’s all scaly and stuff.\nMCINTYRE: Isn't awakening a long-forgotten species a wonderful thing?\nDOCTOR: Long-forgotten? Depends on the species. I want to take a closer look. Would you hold my cocoa a minute, please?\nGENEVIEVE: What? Oh. Oh yes, of course, but... Do you know what it is?\nDOCTOR: You should turn off the heat source before more of those things start thawing out.\nBARSET: I give the orders here.\nDOCTOR: Ah. The man with the talking money. Are you rich and stupid or rich and clever?\nBARSET: I don’t think I like your tone.\nDOCTOR: Rich and stupid. I see.\nBARSET: Rich and powerful, actually. Harman, aim your gun at this man.\nHARMAN: Sir.\nGENEVIEVE: Captain, no!\nMCINTYRE: Put that gun down, Harman!\nBARSET: Harman does what he’s told, don’t you, Captain?\nHARMAN: Yes, sir.\nBARSET: Now, do I have your attention? Well, do I?\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed this?\nBARSET: Step away from the creature or I'll order you shot.\nDOCTOR: Oh, are you talking to me? Argh, I still Keep hearing that noise. Are you sure none of you can hear it? No? Hmm.\nGENEVIEVE: You asked if we’d noticed something.\nBARSET: I want to know who you are and what you're doing here.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I’ve no idea, sorry. But I’m hoping it'll come back to me sooner or later.\nBARSET: Well, that’s not good enough.\nDOCTOR: I know, but it’s all I have to offer, I’m afraid. Can I answer Genevieve’s question, or are you still going to have me shot?\nBARSET: What?\nGENEVIEVE: Go ahead. What should we have noticed?\nDOCTOR: This, here.\nMCINTYRE: There’s a mark on the creature’s head.\nDOCTOR: I think you'll find it’s on all the others.\nBEN: What is it? Looks like... like a brand or something.\nDOCTOR: That’s precisely what it is. Who are you?\nBEN: Ben. Ben Hodgson.\nDOCTOR: Pleased to meet you, Ben. Are you rich?\nBEN: Er, not really, no.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Poor and clever. The other end of the scale.\nGENEVIEVE: These creatures are branded?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I don’t remember who they are. Oh, it’s very annoying, isn’t it.\nBARSET: Yes. Yes it is.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there it is again.\nGENEVIEVE: The sound you keep hearing?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s helping.\nBEN: What, helping you remember, like?\nDOCTOR: I think so.\nMCINTYRE: What does this brand mean?\nDOCTOR: It means you should leave these creatures to the ice. I know that for sure.\nBARSET: You’re going to have to come up with something more than a vague warning.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s very simple. I mean, you think you’ve uncovered some ancient city or tomb, don’t you?\nMCINTYRE: Perhaps. Lord Barset?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s neither a city nor a tomb. This is a maximum security prison and these creatures, they are convicted, dangerous criminals.\nGENEVIEVE: Criminals?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Murderers."

I really would suggest you turn off the heat.\nBARSET: I’m not interested in your suggestions.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there it is again. Yes, yes.\nGENEVIEVE: How do you know of this? How do you expect us to believe you?\nDOCTOR: It’s getting stronger, stronger.\nBARSET: He’s not listening to you, Jennie. He’s too busy hearing voices.\nDOCTOR: Not voices. It’s... Actually, I’m not sure what it is, not yet, but it’s important.\nBARSET: You see? As mad as the trees. Hodgson?\nBEN: Yes, sir.\nBARSET: Take him to the control room and keep a gun on him.\nBEN: I don’t think he’s that\nBARSET: Do as you're told! Move it.\nBEN: Er, sorry, sir.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s all right, Mister Hodgson. I prefer the company of the poor and clever. May I have my cocoa back, Ace?\nGENEVIEVE: Genevieve.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Sorry.\nGENEVIEVE: If it will help, you can call me Jenny.\nDOCTOR: No, no, I’m afraid it won’t. Thank you for the cocoa, it’s lovely. Is there any more?\nBARSET: Oh, get him out of here.\nBEN: Come on, pal\nDOCTOR: (receding) Will there be any more cocoa in the control room?\nBARSET: Right, Jenny, I want a full medical scan of this body.\nGENEVIEVE: The equipment I have here is only good for sonic imaging of objects in the ice. The medical stuff is in my lab. Can you please tell me what the hell is going on here? What are these things?\nMCINTYRE: He thinks they’re part of an indigenous reptilian species that pre-dates mankind.\nGENEVIEVE: And why the hell do you think that?\nBARSET: All you need to know is that the contents of this cavern will bring us all unprecedented wealth and power.\nGENEVIEVE: What?\nDOCTOR: [memory]: You idiot, look what you’ve done! (repeats)\nDOCTOR: [memory]: No! No, don't. (repeats)\nDOCTOR: (wakes up) Betrayed?\nBEN: You all right?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. Yes. Oh.\nBEN: Are you sure? You don’t look all right.\nDOCTOR: How do you know what I’m supposed to look like?\nBEN: Fair point well made. It’s just, you look like — I dunno — as if you’ve seen a ghost or summat.\nDOCTOR: A ghost. Are they just ghosts?\nBEN: So... more cocoa for you, then?\nDOCTOR: Hmm mmm.\nBEN: Cocoa?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, please. You’re very kind, Ben. Very kind. Ah, this control room is very well equipped.\nBEN: Nothing but the best for our Lordship.\nDOCTOR: Satellite transmitter. Those batteries must be cutting edge technology.\nBEN: Size of a chocolate box, enough power to run this snowcap for a month. Cost as much as the national debt of a small country.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. How did you end up working for such a stupid rich man?\nBEN: Money.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nBEN: Sorry about the gun, by the way. Do you mind if I put it down?\nDOCTOR: No, not at all.\nBEN: I mean, you’re not going to be making a dash for it, are you?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? A dash? I remember something about dashing. Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Do you trust me?\nBEN: Yeah. You’ve got a friendly face. Honest.\nDOCTOR: Face. Hmm, yes. Which one?\nBEN: Eh? Are you all right? You got a headache or something?\nDOCTOR: Ah yes. This one. Interesting.\nBEN: What’s interesting?\nDOCTOR: Oh, nothing. I think I’ve just remembered something rather important about myself.\nBEN: Really? Here, what’s that noise you keep hearing?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nBEN: Maybe a doctor should have a look in your ears.\nDOCTOR: Doctor!\nBEN: Er, yeah. What’s the matter, don’t you like doctors?\nDOCTOR: I think... actually, I think I do like doctors. Doc — Tor.\nBEN: Are you okay, mate?\nDOCTOR: No. But I think I’m going to be. I hope.\nBEN: Well, that’s good news then. Here you go, nice and hot.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Ben. (drinks) Ah. Mmm, lovely. And suddenly life becomes glorious. Mmm.\nBEN: Course, he’s back on the Fortitude.\nDOCTOR: Fortitude?\nBEN: Our ship, back beyond the ice barrier.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I see. No, I don’t. Who’s on the Fortitude?\nBEN: The doctor.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor! Thats it!\nBEN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: !’m the Doctor!\nMCINTYRE: (distant) We should be cautious. If that man is right...\nBARSET: (approaching) That man is deranged.\nGENEVIEVE: But how do you explain this?\nBARSET: I’m not required to explain anything. Now, I want a medical scan of this creature and I want the others melted out of the ice, then we move further into the cavern to see what we can find.\nMCINTYRE: Just what are you expecting to find?\nGENEVIEVE: And what if those creatures come to life?\nBARSET: And what on Earth makes you think that’s going to happen?\nGENEVIEVE: He came to life, that man.\nBARSET: That man is, I don’t know, some kind of freak. He probably wandered out of that dry valley ecobase, lost his sense of direction and fell down a hole into the cavern a couple of days ago.\nMCINTYRE: He was frozen solid.\nGENEVIEVE: And anyway, his medical scan says he’s not human.\nBARSET: He’s nothing to do with what we’ve found here.\nGENEVIEVE: He is what we’ve found here. He’s part of it, and he knows something about it, and I think\nBARSET: And he hears noises in his head. Jenny, just do as you’re told, will you? Harman, leave the emitters at full and have this creature carried to Jenny’s lab. And what are you staring at, McIntyre?\nMCINTYRE: Have you noticed this?\nBARSET: What?\nGENEVIEVE: I see what you mean.\nBARSET: What the hell are you two\nGENEVIEVE: This was the first of these creatures to fall out of the ice, right?\nBARSET: Yes. Why?\nMCINTYRE: These two are more recent. And they're different.\nBARSET: Different? What on Earth do you... Oh. Oh yes, I see what you mean. This one’s head is different, and his build is slimmer. What do you think it means?\nMCINTYRE: I’ve no idea.\nBARSET: Well, thank you for your expertise. I’m so glad I brought you along, Professor Mcintyre.\nMCINTYRE: I’m not an expert in unknown species. I’m an archaeologist.\nBARSET: Hmm. Well, maybe... maybe it’s the leader or something.\nGENEVIEVE: Maybe. There’s no way of telling.\nBARSET: And those others, they’re the sort of grunts, the ones who carry out the orders.\nGENEVIEVE: Like us, you mean, your Lordship?\nBARSET: How very astute of you, Jenny my love. Let’s get on, shall we?\nDOCTOR: A private heritage expedition. Hmm.\nBEN: That’s right. Given permission to be in the Antarctic to recover the remains of the 1929 Barset expedition. But I reckon there’s more to it than that.\nDOCTOR: Really? Ben, tell me more.\nBEN: Well... I probably shouldn’t say any more, Doc.\nDOCTOR: I know, but you don’t like Lord Barset, so you’re going to anyway.\nBEN: (laughs) Yeah. Here, are you really millions of years old?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so, no, but I suppose I could be. Well, I can’t remember. Anyway, you were saying.\nBEN: Well, if this expedition was just about finding the remains of his Lordship’s granddad, then why have we got McIntyre and Mademoiselle here?\nDOCTOR: To help them find the remains?\nBEN: Maybe. But I keep my ears open.\nDOCTOR: Always advisable. More comfortable that way.\nBEN: Yeah. And I’ve heard those two, you know, the Prof and Jenny, chin-wagging. They knew they were here to find more than bits and bones from 1929. I mean, look at the high-tech stuff they've got for probing and that. And then there’s the weapons we’ve been issued with. What’s that about?\nDOCTOR: Do you think Lord Barset is doing something illegal here?\nBEN: Probably. Och, I dunno. He’s the kind of bloke who’s used to getting everything he can pay for.\nDOCTOR: Money talks.\nBEN: Darn right there. Talked me into this lot, didn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Is that why you haven't contacted the authorities? Because you feel guilty?\nBEN: Even if I wanted to, I can’t. The radio’s been on the blink ever since we started digging here.\nDOCTOR: I think what Barset’s doing here is at the very least unwise, and at the most appallingly dangerous. Would you stop me if I tried to radio for help, Ben?\nBEN: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Let me see.\nBEN: See? Can't get anything through that. That’s why Barset came running out here with guns. He hadn’t heard from us in six days. You might as well switch it off, Doc. Here, what’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: Wait a moment. If I can just retune a little. That’s it! That’s the noise I’ve been hearing.\nBEN: Eh? How come?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, but I first heard it a very long time ago, and now sonic vibrations...\nBEN: Sonic vibrations?\nDOCTOR: I think they’re stimulating my brain.\nBEN: Er, are they?\nDOCTOR: Helping me to remember what happened all those years ago.\nBEN: But you keep hearing it even when the radio’s not on.\nDOCTOR: I have very good senses. But at the moment, well, they're somewhat muddled.\nBEN: You mean that noise is not just in your head? Not just something you’re remembering?\nDOCTOR: No, I think I’m hearing it.\nBEN: Like you’ve got superpowered ears or something.\nDOCTOR: And it seems to be getting louder.\nGENEVIEVE: Mac.\nMCINTYRE: What?\nGENEVIEVE: Come over here, quickly. Have you any idea what we are getting ourselves into?\nMCINTYRE: I er... look, Jenny. Barset and that creature’s party are going to be here any second.\nGENEVIEVE: I know. That’s why I’m asking you now. What the hell are we doing here? If that creature is as dangerous as I\nMCINTYRE: Shh. They're coming. Ah yes, that’s right. Over here on this table.\nBARSET: That’s it. Right, Harman, wait outside.\nHARMAN: Er, right, sir. Yes, of course.\nBARSET: The rest of you can get back to the cavern. Well? Come on, Jenny.\nGENEVIEVE: Take a look for yourself.\nBARSET: I’m not an expert in anatomy.\nMCINTYRE: Look, Barset, you must have see x-rays of the human body at some point in your life. Does this resemble anything you remember?\nBARSET: Of course not. It’s a different species.\nMCINTYRE: But indigenous to Earth. You said that earlier.\nBARSET: Did I?\nMCINTYRE: I think it’s time you told us exactly what your grandfather wrote in this mysterious diary of his.\nGENEVIEVE: Well, your Lordship?\nBARSET: I don’t think so. Not just yet.\nGENEVIEVE: What?\nBARSET: Maybe that funny little man is right. Maybe this creature is coming back to life. And when it does, we can all get the answers we need, can’t we?\nMCINTYRE: And exactly what answers do you need?\nBARSET: Let’s find out what our mystery man really knows.\nMCINTYRE: I agree.\nBARSET: Finally. Will wonders never cease?\nGENEVIEVE: I don’t recommend any kind of interrogation. That man has just come out of a kind of a coma unprecedented in medical history. He could, I dunno, suffer a relapse at any moment.\nBARSET: Well, you’d better come along to sooth his brow, hadn’t you, Nurse Genevieve. Harman.\nHARMAN: Sir?\nBARSET: Stay here and keep an eye on this fellow, please.\nHARMAN: Right, sir.\nBARSET: Jenny and dear Kelvin, you’re with me. And keep in contact with the ice cavern, Harman.\nHARMAN: Right you are, sir. Harman to Kelly. Come in.\nKELLY: [OC]: Kelly here, sir. Not reading you very well, Captain.\nHARMAN: Never mind that. Look, I’m a bit tied up in the lab at the moment, so I want you to keep an eye on the melting. Keep the water levels down. You understand me?\nKELLY: [OC]: Understood.\nHARMAN: I don’t want to hear about anyone slipping up, falling on their backside and breaking their necks, all right?\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello. Nice to see you all again. I’m the Doctor.\nGENEVIEVE: You are?\nBEN: He’s started remembering stuff. Says it’s something to do with the radio interference?\nBARSET: What interference?\nMCINTYRE: You mean the reason we couldn’t get through to the Fortitude?\nBEN: That’s right. Says it’s stimulating his brain. That’s right, isn’t it, Doc?\nDOCTOR: I think so.\nGENEVIEVE: What else have you remembered?\nBARSET: Wait a minute. You never mentioned this radio interference to me.\nMCINTYRE: I did try to explain, but you seemed more interested in having your men wave guns under my nose.\nDOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt, but I think I need to know where this interference is coming from.\nBARSET: You think you need to know?\nDOCTOR: That Police Box thing. I need to get inside it.\nGENEVIEVE: Why, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure, but I think I’ll know when I get inside.\nBARSET: What do you mean, you’re the Doctor?\nBEN: He says it’s his name.\nBARSET: Did anyone ask you, Hodgson?\nBEN: Just trying to be helpful.\nBARSET: Well, don't.\nHARMAN: Well, when we get through to the Fortitude, we can maybe get some batteries sent out. Either that or I'll send a couple of you back in the snowcat tomorrow. Which reminds me, get somebody to recharge the snowcat batteries.\nKELLY: [OC]: Sir, what about that bad weather warning we had before we left? Storm should be only a few hours off now.\nHARMAN: Good point, Sam. I'll have a word with his Lordship. Anyway, get back to (unintelligible)\nKELLY: [OC]: Sir.\nHARMAN: No! Stay back! Argh!\nBARSET: Now listen to me, Doctor. I want some answers from you.\nDOCTOR: I think you’ve already got some answers of your own, Lord Barset.\nBARSET: What's that supposed to mean?\nDOCTOR: Care to share them?\nGENEVIEVE: Er, Doctor, maybe you could tell us if you remembered anything at all? Were you really here millions of years ago?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nGENEVIEVE: And, er, you said someone fired at you.\nBARSET: Fired!\nGENEVIEVE: Well, was it one of those creatures from the ice?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it was. And then I drowned.\nBARSET: And flew to the moon and back while you were at it, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: No. I put myself into a coma, to survive.\nMCINTYRE: Where are you from, Doctor? You know it’s totally impossible for you to have lived here millions of years ago.\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nBARSET: You say one of these creatures attacked you.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nBARSET: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because it’s the truth.\nBARSET: No, I mean why did it attack you? Well?\nDOCTOR: That’s all I remember.\nBEN: Are those things really bad news, Doc?\nDOCTOR: The worst news.\nMCINTYRE: Someone’s pressed the panic button.\nGENEVIEVE: It’s coming from my lab.\nMCINTYRE: Must be Captain Harman.\nBARSET: Harman? What’s going on?\nHARMAN: [OC]: Lord Barset, that creature, it... it was alive. It knocked me out.\nDOCTOR: Where is it now, Captain?\nHARMAN: [OC]: I don’t know. It’s gone.\nBEN: Gone?\nBARSET: Well, go and find it.\nDOCTOR: You wanted to revive that creature, didn’t you, Lord Barset. Why? What do you think you’ve found here?\nBARSET: I don’t have to answer your questions.\nDOCTOR: No. No, you don’t have to. But it might help if you did.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, Lord Barset believes the creatures we found in the ice are the remnants of a species that pre-dates the emergence of the human race.\nDOCTOR: And why would he believe a thing like that?\nMCINTYRE: You might as well tell us.\nBARSET: It’s er... it’s a family matter.\nMCINTYRE: He has his grandfather’s expedition diary.\nGENEVIEVE: A diary that was never mentioned when we signed up for this expedition.]\nBARSET: It was kept secret.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nBARSET: Because what it had to say was... People would have thought... Well, there was no need to tell anyone until I had proof.\nDOCTOR: Proof of what? I mean, what happened back in 1929?\nBARSET: The expedition was lost. Their ship, the Rochester, sank without trace. One man got away.\nDOCTOR: Got away?\nBARSET: When they found him, he was clutching the diary. He was half-frozen to death and... well, they reckon he’d been driven mad by fear.\nDOCTOR: It’s possible.\nBARSET: He died screaming about monsters.\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nBARSET: The creatures we found here.\nDOCTOR: But these creatures have been frozen in the ice for millions of years. They weren’t walking around in 1929.\nBARSET: What are you trying to say?\nDOCTOR: What did your grandfather’s diary have to say about them?\nBARSET: He said they’d encountered what he called lizard-men, reptiles that walked upright. They had intelligence, a superior technology - superior to man’s in 1929 - and from what he wrote, clearly still far superior to current human technology.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nBARSET: What?\nDOCTOR: And that’s what you want. Superior technology.\nBARSET: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Tell me, have you found any signs of the lost expedition?\nMCINTYRE: No. No, we haven't.\nDOCTOR: But this is its last recorded position, here in the cavern?\nGENEVIEVE: Well, no. This is quite some way from the map references we were given, but when the cavern registered on our sonic probes we assumed the original estimates were way off target. It seemed reasonable, especially when we started picking up readings that indicated artificial structures.\nDOCTOR: And you thought you’d found the city of your lizard-men, didn’t you, Lord Barset?\nBEN: Er, yeah, and can I respectfully remind everyone that one of them just clobbered Captain Harman, and is on the loose round here.\nBARSET: Good point, Hodgson. Professor, I suggest we go to the cavern and find out what’s going... What the hell?\nGENEVIEVE: It’s coming from the cavern!\nBARSET: Harman! Harman, come in!\nHARMAN: [OC]: Sir? Oh, my God!\nMCINTYRE: What on Earth’s happening down there?\nBARSET: Hodgson, pick up that gun and come with me. The rest of you stay here.\nGENEVIEVE: You don’t think those creatures are the lizard-men in the diary, do you?\nDOCTOR: No. No, and I’m remembering more now.\nMCINTYRE: What, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Nothing very exact at all, except... they’re war criminals.\nGENEVIEVE: What! What war? How... Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: To avert a massacre.\nBARSET: My God!\nBEN: They’ve all come to life!\nHARMAN: Get down, sir. Over here.\nBARSET: How many have we lost?\nHARMAN: I don’t know, sir. About five or six. Our bullets just bounce right off them.\nBEN: What are those weapons they’re using? Every time they fire you can...\nBARSET: We've got grenades in the snowcat. Somebody’s going to have to go and get them.\nDOCTOR: Cease fire! Cease fire!\nBARSET: What’s he doing? Is he completely mad?\nBEN: Don't knock it, your Lordship. It seems to have worked.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, get down. You’re going to get yourself killed.\nMCINTYRE: Jenny, come back here.\nGENEVIEVE: Why have they stopped?\nDOCTOR: I think they recognise me.\nGENEVIEVE: And do you recognise them now?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nARAKSSOR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. It’s all coming back to me now.\nDOCTOR: They broke out of their cells.\nDOCTOR: Geldar, how could this happen?\nGELDAR: The guards. We have been betrayed. It is too late, Doctor. You must save yourself. They will show no mercy.\nDOCTOR: Have you activated your distress signal?\nGELDAR: The power has been cut.\nDOCTOR: Go to the communications chamber and switch the signal on from there. I'll find a way to reconnect the power on my way back to the Tardis.\nDOCTOR: Good, good. That should do it. Right. (runs) Ah! Hello. Fancy meeting you here. No! No, don’t!\nDOCTOR: You idiot! Look what you’ve done!\nGENEVIEVE: The whole chamber’s thawed out. It’s incredible!\nMCINTYRE: Like the inside of a... an iron cathedral.\nDOCTOR: Lord Barset, tell your men to lower their guns.\nARAKSSOR: The escape has been a success, Doctor.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, who are they?\nDOCTOR: I remember now, seeing them here. They are not your grandfather’s lizard-men, Lord Barset. The Antarctic holds many secrets yet to unfold. These creatures are a different story altogether.\nBARSET: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: They’re not of this Earth.\nMCINTYRE: Not... Well then, where are they from?\nDOCTOR: Mars.\nGENEVIEVE: Mars? But that’s impossible.\nDOCTOR: When I first met them, you humans called them Ice Warriors. Hello, Arakssor.\nARAKSSOR: So, you survived with us.\nDOCTOR: So it would appear.\nARAKSSOR: How long did we sleep?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m not sure, but a good few million years.\nARAKSSOR: Then there is much work to be done, and you will not stop us this time.\nBARSET: I am Lord Barset. I think there’s been some kind of misunderstanding here.\nARAKSSOR: Lord?\nBARSET: Yes. It’s an hereditary title, despite the attempts of the modernisers.\nARAKSSOR: I am Lord Arakssor.\nBARSET: Well, I’m honoured to meet you.\nARAKSSOR: You melted us from the ice?\nBARSET: Yes.\nARAKSSOR: Why?\nBARSET: Well, er...\nDOCTOR: Yes, do please tell us, Barset.\nBARSET: A quest for knowledge, Lord Arakssor.\nARAKSSOR: Knowledge?\nBARSET: Well, Martians and humans could be of assistance to one another?\nARAKSSOR: Yes, you will assist us.\nDOCTOR: Barset, you're a fool if you think he'll do anything except kill you.\nBARSET: I’m dealing with this, Doctor. Lord Arakssor.\nDOCTOR: These creatures are war criminals imprisoned here for trying to turn the Martians into a race of warmongers.\nBARSET: I apologise for this man’s stupidity. He is not part of my\nARAKSSOR: We are well used to the Doctor and his interfering ways. Kill him.\nBEN: No!\nDOCTOR: Barset, you idiot.\nBARSET: Wait a minute, Arakssor. I didn’t mean...\nARAKSSOR: I thought you wished to cooperate with us.\nBARSET: Cooperate? I thought... What do you mean?\nARAKSSOR: Which is the leader of your warriors?\nBARSET: Warriors? Er, well, I’m not sure I\nARAKSSOR: The one who commands these men who fought and died here.\nDOCTOR: Don’t answer him, Barset.\nBARSET: Shut up, Doctor. Arakssor and I don’t want you interfering.\nGENEVIEVE: He’s gone crazy.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. He thinks he’s being clever.\nBARSET: Well, I suppose Captain Harman is the leader of\nHARMAN: For crying out loud, leave me out of this.\nARAKSSOR: Then you, Lord Barset and Captain Harman, will remain alive. Kill the others. Kill them all."

Come on!\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Arakssor, they are...\nARAKSSOR: Stop... stop them. Ssrongar...\nDOCTOR: We've got to get away from here. Those heat emitters won’t stop them for long.\nGENEVIEVE: Mac, are you all right?\nMCINTYRE: Quickly, the snowcat. Can you drive it?\nBEN: No problem, Prof. I can drive her. Come on, everyone. All aboard.\nSSRONGAR: Heat source destroyed, Lord Arakssor.\nARAKSSOR: Find... find the other humans and kill them.\nGENEVIEVE: I thought you said you could drive this thing.\nBEN: I’ve had a couple of goes in it.\nMCINTYRE: Couple of goes?\nBEN: I’d forgotten to use the batteries.\nGENEVIEVE: Never mind that. Just drive this thing as fast as you can.\nBEN: Okay, okay.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Are they dead, Ssrongar.\nSSRONGAR: They have escaped me.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Return to the prison. There is work to be done.\nHARMAN: They got away, then.\nBARSET: Shut up, Harman.\nARAKSSOR: What help can the Doctor and his friends hope to reach in this wilderness? Well?\nARAKSSOR: You are soft and weak.\nHARMAN: Leave him alone. What do you want to know? You want to know about the Fortitude, is that it?\nARAKSSOR: What is this Fortitude?\nHARMAN: It’s our ship.\nARAKSSOR: And does your ship have the capability to attack us?\nHARMAN: Attack? No, I don’t know what... Ow!\nARAKSSOR: If you are lying to me, I will crush your weak flesh.\nMCINTYRE: This is Mcintyre to Fortitude. Come in.\nGENEVIEVE: Try again, Mac.\nMCINTYRE: This is Professor McIntyre in Aristo One calling Fortitude. Come in, please. This is an emergency.\nBEN: Just that interference again, Doc.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know.\nGENEVIEVE: Have you no idea what it is, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh Jenny, I wish I could remember.\nDOCTOR: What’s so funny?\nGENEVIEVE: You remembered my name.\nDOCTOR: What? Oh yes. Yes, I did, didn’t I?\nGENEVIEVE: Merci bien.\nDOCTOR: De rien.\nMCINTYRE: Doctor, this interference or whatever it is, surely it can’t be blanketing the whole of Antarctica? There must be a limit to its influence.\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope so. Keep trying.\nBARSET: Oh, for pity’s sake. Please, don’t you understand? The Fortitude can’t attack us. It’s just... itisn’ta military vessel. It doesn’t have any armaments.\nARAKSSOR: But it could bring warriors here to attack us?\nBARSET: How could it?\nHARMAN: For God’s sake, he thinks it’s a spaceship or something. Ah!\nARAKSSOR: What kind of ship is this Fortitude?\nBARSET: Oh, I see. No, no, no, no, it’s not a spaceship. It travels on the water.\nARAKSSOR: On the water.\nBARSET: It brought us here, and we travelled across the ice in a.... in a small vehicle.\nARAKSSOR: A vehicle such as the one the Doctor and his friends escaped in?\nBARSET: Yes, yes, yes. Such a vehicle.\nARAKSSOR: How long will it take the Doctor to reach your ship?\nBARSET: Er, a couple of days?\nHARMAN: He won’t make it.\nBARSET: What?\nHARMAN: I said, he won’t make it, all right? The battery needs replacing.\nARAKSSOR: How far will they get?\nHARMAN: Not far enough. They haven’t got enough cold weather gear, and there’s a storm approaching.\nARAKSSOR: Then they will die. That is good.\nGENEVIEVE: What is that? Ben, what’s going on?\nMCINTYRE: Battery light.\nBEN: It’s almost out of juice.\nDOCTOR: Do you have a reserve?\nBEN: No. Damn it.\nMCINTYRE: I'll try the radio again, shall I?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMCINTYRE: [OC]: (fading) This is Aristo One to Fortitude. Do you read me? Over. This is Aristo One to Fortitude. Do you read me? Over.\nBARSET: What do you want us to do with these things?\nARAKSSOR: As you can see, this chamber is still filled with ice.\nHARMAN: Yes. You want us to use these heat emitters to melt it.\nARAKSSOR: Yes. Connect the power.\nBARSET: Right. I’ve got it. (sotto) Harman, did you see how the heat affected them before?\nHARMAN: (sotto) Yes, but I’m not risking\nARAKSSOR: You will observe that Ssrongar is pointing his sonic blaster at you.\nBARSET: Oh, is he? Yes, I see.\nARAKSSOR: If you should show any sign of using this heat source against us, you will be killed. Do you understand me, Lord Barset?\nBARSET: Of course. There couldn’t have been anything further from my thoughts.\nARAKSSOR: Of course. You will begin.\nBARSET: What exactly is in here, Lord Arakssor?\nARAKSSOR: That is none of your concern. Increase the power.\nBARSET: (sotto) Harman, what’s that sound? Can you hear that?\nHARMAN: (sotto) Sounds like... sounds like that interference we picked up when Mclntyre’s coms went down.\nMCINTYRE: Nothing.\nBEN: It’s not looking too clever out there, is it?\nDOCTOR: How far is it to your ship?\nMCINTYRE: Too far to make it on foot.\nGENEVIEVE: We'd freeze to death.\nBEN: We'll freeze to death if we stay in here as well. Nobody knows we're here.\nDOCTOR: Except the Ice Warriors.\nMCINTYRE: So what are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: You must all put these on.\nGENEVIEVE: But there’s not enough for all four of us.\nDOCTOR: But nearly enough for three of you.\nMCINTYRE: You... you mean... Doctor, you can’t go out there without proper clothing.\nDOCTOR: I’m a alien lifeform, Professor McIntyre. I don’t need as much protection from the cold. At least I hope I don't.\nGENEVIEVE: You'll freeze to death. You can’t be that resistant to the cold, it’s impossible.\nDOCTOR: And how many impossible things have you witnessed today, Jenny? Look, our only chance is to get a call through to your ship. That signal interference must have a limit.\nBEN: You're sure about that?\nDOCTOR: We have to take your portable transmitter with us.\nGENEVIEVE: And when we're beyond the influence of this interference, we call Fortitude for help?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now, come on, get this stuff on, all of you. Ben, get the radio.\nBEN: Right, boss. Here, Doc, weather’s looking pretty ugly now.\nDOCTOR: I know, but this is our only chance, Ben. Are you with me?\nBEN: I told you, you’ve got an honest face.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Ssrongar. What is your report?\nSSRONGAR: The control centre has been reactivated.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: You must assess the condition of this planet, then locate the sonic cannon.\nSSRONGAR: Yes, Lord Arakssor.\nHARMAN: That signal is getting louder.\nBARSET: Yes. It’s coming from in there, isn’t it?\nHARMAN: Sir, look at that. Do you see what I see?\nBARSET: My God. I wonder who that is?\nDOCTOR: All right, Ben. We'd better try the radio again.\nBEN: Right you are, Doc.\nDOCTOR: Everyone rest for a moment.\nGENEVIEVE: You okay, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m fine, thanks. Professor McIntyre?\nMCINTYRE: (weak) Yes, I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.\nGENEVIEVE: He’s not fine.\nDOCTOR: I know. Ben?\nBEN: Is it even worth trying, Doc?\nDOCTOR: Oh, better save the battery. Let’s move on for an hour or so, and try again. Come on, Professor. Let me give you a hand.\nMCINTYRE: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, come on.\nBARSET: It’s another one of them in there.\nHARMAN: Do you think he’s dead?\nBARSET: Why should he be? The others weren't.\nHARMAN: Have you thought about what happens when they don’t need us to operate this\nBARSET: Oh, just shut up, Harman. You’re getting on my nerves, man.\nARAKSSOR: Report, Ssrongar.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: This planet’s atmosphere is suffering from a build-up of gasses in the advanced stages of causing climatic upheaval.\nBARSET: I think they’re talking about global warming.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: The mean temperature of this planet is rising, but extreme weather fluctuations are causing severe cold conditions. A freezing storm is about to envelope this continent.\nARAKSSOR: Excellent. We will exploit this phenomenon to our advantage.\nGENEVIEVE: Mac! Mac, he’s... Doctor, it’s the Professor.\nDOCTOR: Professor Mcintyre.\nMCINTYRE: I can’t... can’t go on.\nGENEVIEVE: We mustn’t let him sleep, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know. Help me with him.\nMCINTYRE: Doctor, Doctor, listen.\nDOCTOR: Professor, we have to get you up on your feet again.\nMCINTYRE: I, I, I can’t. I can’t feel... You have to leave me. I’m not going to make it.\nGENEVIEVE: No. Mac, you can make it. You have to.\nMCINTYRE: You must go on. Try... try to help me, it'll only slow you down, and then you'll all die.\nBEN: Fortitude, can you read us? We need help. Urgent help. Come in. Nothing. Still nothing.\nGENEVIEVE: The storm’s getting worse.\nDOCTOR: I won’t be beaten by bad weather!\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, the Professor’s not going to make it. Neither are we.\nDOCTOR: No. Ben, switch that on again.\nBEN: What? It’s just that interference.\nDOCTOR: I want to hear it again.\nGENEVIEVE: But you’ve heard it before. We’ve all heard it. There’s nothing else.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I heard it before. I want to hear it again. Ben!\nBEN: Okay, okay.\nDOCTOR: That sound. Come on, come on. What are you telling me?\nGELDAR: We owe you so much, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: All in a day’s work.\nGELDAR: You treat this matter with such lightness, my friend, but I know you understand.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I do, Geldar.\nGELDAR: Even now it feels as if this isn’t over. The thought of Arakssor’s vision for our people’s future still haunts me.\nDOCTOR: And so it should. That way you'll never let it happen again.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nGELDAR: No, Doctor. Arakssor and his cohorts have broken out of their cells.\nDOCTOR: How did this happen?\nGELDAR: The guards. We have been betrayed. It is too late, Doctor. You must save yourself. They will show no mercy.\nDOCTOR: Have you activated your distress signal?\nGELDAR: The power has been cut..\nDOCTOR: Go to the communications chamber and switch the signal on from there. I'll find a way to reconnect the power on my way back to the Tardis.\nDOCTOR: That sound. A distress signal.\nBEN: What’s he saying?\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor. Doctor!\nBEN: I don’t know if he can hear you. I think his mind’s gone. How’s the Professor?\nGENEVIEVE: I couldn’t wake him. He just wanted to sleep. He wouldn't listen to me.\nBEN: You ask me, he’s the lucky one.\nGENEVIEVE: Ben, we are not going to...\nBEN: Try not to think about it.\nARAKSSOR: You have done well, humans.\nBARSET: What is this place?\nARAKSSOR: A communications chamber.\nBARSET: Who's that?\nARAKSSOR: That is Geldar.\nBARSET: Is he a friend of yours?\nARAKSSOR: Geldar is... at my mercy.\nHARMAN: I think he’s waking up.\nBARSET: I’ve a feeling he’s going to regret that.\nHARMAN: What's that noise we’ve been hearing? We picked it up on our radio before.\nARAKSSOR: Ssrongar.\nSSRONGAR: Yes, my Lord.\nARAKSSOR: Switch it off.\nARAKSSOR: What noise?\nDOCTOR: That's it! The transmitter. Try it again, now.\nBEN: Doctor, there’s no point, mate.\nDOCTOR: All right, I'll do it myself. Right, now how does this thing work?\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, why are you doing this? You won’t get through. We haven’t moved since we last tried.\nDOCTOR: Go ahead, Ben. They'll recognise your voice.\nBEN: Doc, just give it up, will you?\nDOCTOR: Ben!\nBEN: This is Ben Hodgson calling Fortitude. Do you read me? Over.\nGENEVIEVE: I suppose it was worth\nFORTITUDE: [OC]: This is Fortitude. Fortitude receiving. Your signal is very weak. Can you hear us? Over.\nDOCTOR: Is anyone going to answer that?\nSSRONGAR: The transmission strength was weak. It was only activated by energy from the human’s heat emitters.\nARAKSSOR: Is there a record of any response?\nSSRONGAR: No, Lord Arakssor.\nARAKSSOR: Good.\nHARMAN: Do you know what the hell they’re talking about?\nBARSET: I’m not sure, but let’s just keep quiet for now, eh, Harman, there’s a good chap.\nGELDAR: Arakssor, what have you done?\nARAKSSOR: Ah, Geldar. Welcome back to the land of the living. You always assume I am to blame.\nGELDAR: What is your meaning?\nARAKSSOR: That we owe our re-awakening to these humans.\nGELDAR: Humans?\nARAKSSOR: The dominant race that emerged on the blue planet while we remained encased in ice for millions of years.\nGELDAR: So our people have been free of your madness for millions of years. I am thankful.\nARAKSSOR: Thankful that the warriors of the red planet have lived the lives of cowards? You are a traitor to our race, Geldar.\nGELDAR: If wanting peace and co-existence with the rest of the galaxy is treachery, then I plead guilty.\nARAKSSOR: Under my rule, we would have been masters of the galaxy, not cowering scum who consort with inferiors.\nGELDAR: We were glad of the alien Doctor’s help in preventing your military coup. My only regret is that your sentence has been interrupted.\nARAKSSOR: The sentence was unlawful. I did not recognise the authority of your court, and neither did my followers, and there were many. My ideals will have lived on. I will reclaim my empire, return to the red planet, but first I will make a fortress of this world.\nGELDAR: I would wish my people dead rather than think of them under your rule.\nARAKSSOR: Then perhaps I can save you from those terrible thoughts, Geldar. You have already pleaded guilty. The sentence is death.\nBARSET: Don’t, Harman. Keep back.\nARAKSSOR: Ssrongar, have you located the sonic cannon?\nSSRONGAR: Yes, Lord.\nARAKSSOR: Excellent. We will use it to alter this planet’s atmospheric gases to make it habitable for our\nARAKSSOR: armies. I will begin the calculations.\nSSRONGAR: What of these humans?\nARAKSSOR: Lord Barset.\nBARSET: Yes?\nARAKSSOR: What would you do in my position?\nBARSET: You mean if I'd been asleep for millions of years? Well, I don’t know. I’d probably\nARAKSSOR: You know what I mean. You have heard my words. You know I plan to obliterate all life on this planet.\nBARSET: Well, no, actually, I hadn’t gathered that. You said something about altering atmospheric gases. I didn’t automatically assume\nARAKSSOR: You say much that has no meaning, Lord Barset. Could it be that you talk merely to prolong your own existence?\nHARMAN: You said you owed us yout lives.\nBARSET: Harman, for goodness’ sake.\nARAKSSOR: Let your warrior Captain speak.\nHARMAN: You said that to your... your dead friend there. And you were right, weren't you. I mean, if it wasn’t for us, you'd still be frozen.\nARAKSSOR: That is true.\nHARMAN: Well, you’re warriors, right?\nARAKSSOR: Yes.\nHARMAN: Don't you have some kind of warrior’s code or, or, or something?\nARAKSSOR: Do you fear me, warrior Captain?\nBARSET: Oh, yes, certainly. We both fear you. Absolutely.\nARAKSSOR: And you both know that if you try to escape you will be killed instantly.\nBARSET: Yes.\nHARMAN: Yes.\nARAKSSOR: They may be of use to us. They may live, for now.\nPILOT: [OC]: This is Blade One. We have a visual on your party, Ben. Over.\nBEN: Blade One, we see you. Can you land?\nPILOT: [OC]: That’s a negative, Ben. Weather’s too bad for us. We'll come in as low as we can and drop a ladder for you. Over.\nGENEVIEVE: The Professor. What about him?\nPILOT: [OC]: You’re going to have to leave the Professor there for now. We're noting the map reference down. We'll return when the weather’s improved. Over.\nDOCTOR: Jenny, there’s nothing we can do for him now.\nGENEVIEVE: Yes. Oh yes, I know.\nBEN: Understood, Blade One. Over.\nPILOT: [OC]: Sending the ladder down now, Ben. Out.\nBARSET: And that must be the sonic cannon we’ve been hearing so much about.\nHARMAN: You know there isn’t a guard out there.\nBARSET: What? Maybe Arakssor expects us to keep our word. That warrior’s code you were blathering on about. Well done though, Harman. Quick thinking.\nHARMAN: Yeah, thanks. But what the hell are they going to use us for, eh? Something not good, and that’s for sure.\nBARSET: Hey, wait a minute. They really have all gone. Probably taking that thing up to the surface.\nHARMAN: Oh no, you’re not actually thinking of making a run for it?\nBARSET: I’m not living by any make-believe warrior’s code., Harman. You’re right. Whatever Arakssor wants us for isn’t going to be good for us, so let’s go, shall we?\nHARMAN: But how? I mean, what are we going to do?\nBARSET: Look, they’ve shut down that signal thing, haven’t they? I’ve got a hunch that means we'll be able to get through to Fortitude. Once we get a call through, we can get some help. Come on.\nPILOT: This is Blade One to Fortitude. Now on final descent. Have on board Doctor Genevieve Marceau, Crewman Ben Hodgson.\nDOCTOR: And the Doctor. Hello.\nPILOT: No, I don’t know who he is either.\nBEN: Look, Doc, I just want to know how you knew we’d get through on the radio that last time.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so do I.\nGENEVIEVE: What do you mean, so do you?\nDOCTOR: Are you warm enough now?\nGENEVIEVE: Look, I thought your memory was working again.\nDOCTOR: Working again? Yes, it’s warming up like an old TV set. Ah, of course!\nGENEVIEVE: What's the matter?\nDOCTOR: Now we're really in trouble. Excuse me.\nBEN: Doctor! He’s gone back to the helicopter. What’s the matter with that guy?\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor!\nPILOT: Understood. We just need to take a look at the fuel level, see what\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, please.\nPILOT: Ow! (distant) Hey! What are you doing? Get down\nDOCTOR: Sorry, I’m in a hurry. (door closes) Right, now how does this thing fly? I’m sure I must have flown one before.\nGENEVIEVE: Hey, where are we going?\nDOCTOR: You should be in the sick bay.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, are you crazy or something?\nDOCTOR: No, you are, coming with me, Jenny. Hold onto something.\nBARSET: Is it clear that way?\nHARMAN: Yeah. No sign of them.\nBARSET: What's the matter?\nHARMAN: I was just thinking about Ben and the others, stuck out there.\nBARSET: What about them?\nHARMAN: Well, when we make the call, we should get Fortitude to send someone to look for them.\nBARSET: First things first, Captain. The Professor’s lot haven’t got a bunch of homicidal aliens breathing down their necks, have they? Come on. Look out. Quick.\nHARMAN: We'll have to go the other way.\nBARSET: Oh no, there’s another one. Harman, look out! Argh!\nGENEVIEVE: We shouldn't be flying in these conditions.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t have to come along.\nGENEVIEVE: No, but I thought you might need some help. Help to do what, by the way?\nDOCTOR: Finish something I started millions of years ago.\nGENEVIEVE: You’ve remembered something, haven’t you? Something to do with that signal.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It was a distress call warning of Arakssor’s escape. It suddenly struck me that it would be his first priority to shut the signal down. By the way, do you always live so dangerously?\nGENEVIEVE: Always.\nDOCTOR: That’s just as well.\nSSRONGAR: They were trying to escape\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Did you destroy them?\nSSRONGAR: Yes.\nARAKSSOR: Is the sonic cannon now in position?\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: Yes, but its power reserve is almost depleted.\nARAKSSOR: The prison’s reactor is now attaining full function. We will connect the sonic cannon to it.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: What is that, Lord?\nARAKSSOR: I am detecting the approach of a flying craft. It seems the humans lied to us. Their Fortitude is able to reach us.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: I see it. It is a small craft, puny design.\nARAKSSOR: Activate the cannon’s power reserve and destroy it.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: Yes, Lord.\nGENEVIEVE: Okay, I get it. You want to get these Ice Warrior things locked up again. But exactly how are you going to do that?\nDOCTOR: You mean how are we going to do that?\nGENEVIEVE: Yes. Just the two of us against the ah!\nGENEVIEVE: What is that?\nDOCTOR: Oh no! They’ve got a sonic cannon!\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, the helicopter’s falling apart.\nDOCTOR: Hold on!"

Over.\nGENEVIEVE: [OC]: Ben, something’s... (unintelligible)... breaking up...\nBEN: Breaking up? Did she just say...\nGENEVIEVE: [OC]: We're going (static)\nBEN: Oh, my God.\nSSRONGAR: Sonic cannon power now exhausted.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Was the flying car destroyed?\nSSRONGAR: Yes, Lord.\nARAKSSOR: Good. You will now connect the sonic cannon to the prison’s reactor. I will begin calculations to modify the sonic beam for our purposes.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: Yes, Lord Arakssor.\nARAKSSOR: Soon we will make this planet ours.\nBARSET: Who's in there? Is there anyone alive? Hello?\nDOCTOR: Yes, we’re alive.\nBARSET: You!\nDOCTOR: But you don’t look too well yourself, Lord Barset.\nBARSET: How did you survive?\nGENEVIEVE: Fell out with your Martian friends, did you? Give me a hand.\nBARSET: Steady. What... what happened?\nDOCTOR: We were shot down by a sonic cannon.\nBARSET: So, they used that thing on you, did they?\nGENEVIEVE: And on you?\nBARSET: I caught a blast of something a bit smaller, but it hurts. It hurts like hell.\nDOCTOR: It would. Sonic vibrations targeted at human cells, not pleasant at all.\nGENEVIEVE: Where’s Harman?\nBARSET: They killed him. Obviously thought they’d got me too.\nDOCTOR: They’re utterly ruthless. Hopefully, they think we’re all dead.\nBARSET: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because that way, they won’t be expecting us to sneak back to your base. Sorry the landing was so bumpy, Jenny. I was trying to make it look worse than it was.\nGENEVIEVE: Listen, Doctor, we’re alive. That’s good enough for me.\nBARSET: Look, why... why the hell do you want to go back there? I nearly got killed getting out.\nDOCTOR: Did you find out what the Martians are planning to do?\nBARSET: That’s why we made a run for it. They’re going to do something... something to the atmosphere.\nDOCTOR: Really. Hmm.\nBARSET: Something about turning the planet into their fortress.\nDOCTOR: And you really need to ask me why we have to go back? Come on.\nSSRONGAR: Power cable is connected. Take the other end of the cable down to the control centre. I will await Lord Arakssor’s instructions.\nICE WARRIOR: Understood, Ssrongar.\nBARSET: Get back.\nGENEVIEVE: Well, presumably he didn’t see us.\nDOCTOR: No wonder that sonic blast wasn’t enough to destroy us.\nGENEVIEVE: It was bad enough.\nDOCTOR: Cannon’s power must be exhausted.\nGENEVIEVE: And that Martian was carrying a cable. Maybe they need to plug it into something.\nDOCTOR: Which means we still have some time.\nBARSET: How are we going to get past Ssrongar over there?\nDOCTOR: At least he’s looking the other way. But Ice Warriors have very good hearing, so the answer to your question is, very carefully. Follow my footsteps.\nARAKSSOR: Red Control, respond. This is Arakssor. Respond! (static) Planetary scan. No signal. No life. The red planet is dead. Then the time of exodus has passed. No matter, there will be new armies to command, a new campaign, an empire to build, and then I will be avenged!\nGENEVIEVE: I found these in the sick bay. They’re pretty strong painkillers.\nBARSET: Will they work?\nDOCTOR: They'll have to do.\nBARSET: Look, I’m really in a lot of pain here so I’d appreciate it if you... I dunno, if you showed some compassion. You are supposed to be a doctor, after all.\nDOCTOR: Doctor, yes. That’s what people have been calling me for centuries.\nGENEVIEVE: Centuries? How much have you remembered?\nDOCTOR: That blue box is my ship.\nGENEVIEVE: The Police Box?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and we need to get to it.\nGENEVIEVE: Why? And how can it be your ship, anyway? It’s just, you know, made of wood.\nBARSET: Look, now that jamming signal has been switched off, we can just call up the Fortitude and get help.\nDOCTOR: What exactly do you know about that signal?\nBARSET: What? Not much. Just that Arakssor was quite keen to shut it off.\nGENEVIEVE: It was a distress signal, wasn’t it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nBARSET: You mean a distress signal sent by that, that Geldar chap?\nDOCTOR: You’ve seen Geldar?\nBARSET: Arakssor had him thawed out then murdered him in cold blood.\nDOCTOR: Geldar. Anything else you haven’t been telling us?\nBARSET: Who put you in charge?\nDOCTOR: You did.\nBARSET: What?\nDOCTOR: The moment you abused your power and privilege to come on this foolhardy expedition.\nBARSET: I didn’t ask for the power and privilege, Doctor. And I thought I was going to do some good.\nGENEVIEVE: Ha. You just wanted to get your hands on the technology you thought was buried out here.\nBARSET: For the benefit of mankind.\nGENEVIEVE: Then why did you keep your grandfather’s diary a secret? Why didn’t you tell the world? Because you wanted it for yourself.\nBARSET: Yes. Yes, but only to prevent a free-for-all.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nBARSET: I wanted any new technologies to unite the world, not to be sold off into a million competing franchises. All the potential benefit for ordinary real people would have been lost in branding and marketing. People would have ended up worrying about colour or design rather than how their lives could be changed for the better. I wanted to serve humanity’s future without grubby little brand executives and their petty empires getting in the way.\nDOCTOR: You wanted control and power however you dress the idea up, Lord Barset. You remind me a little of Arakssor.\nBARSET: I am not a murderer.\nDOCTOR: No, but people have died because you brought them here.\nGENEVIEVE: The Professor’s dead.\nBARSET: What? But I assumed you got picked up.\nGENEVIEVE: Too late for Mac.\nBARSET: Oh, I’m\nDOCTOR: Sorry? It doesn’t help.\nBARSET: All right, all right. But what does?\nDOCTOR: Information. You said the Ice Warriors wanted to do something to the atmosphere.\nBARSET: Yes.\nDOCTOR: And I think I know how.\nSSRONGAR: Ssrongar to control.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Report, Ssrongar.\nSSRONGAR: Sonic cannon power now at maximum.\nARAKSSOR: [OC]: Excellent.\nARAKSSOR: I have completed my calculations. Set the cannon to receive new energy settings.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: Settings received.\nARAKSSOR: Elevate to maximum.\nGENEVIEVE: But how can sonic vibrations from that cannon change the molecular structure of the Earth’s greenhouse gases?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Arakssor’s something of a genius, despite his brutish nature.\nGENEVIEVE: But greenhouse gases into what, refrigerant gases? Is that what you’re saying?\nDOCTOR: Yes. He’s going to evaporate the heat out of the Earth’s atmosphere, and that means er, well, you know... let me think. If you calculate\nGENEVIEVE: Think?\nBARSET: Look, we’ve got to stop him, call for help.\nDOCTOR: Minus thirty two degrees Celsius.\nBARSET: What?\nGENEVIEVE: That’s how cold it’s going to get?\nDOCTOR: Eventually. The human race will be frozen out of existence. We need to get back to the Tardis. Ah.\nGENEVIEVE: The what?\nDOCTOR: So that’s what it’s called. Yes, right, oh, come on, quick. Pick up those batteries. We need to be quick to use our big advantage.\nGENEVIEVE: What’s that, you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, how nice of you to say so, Jenny, but I wasn’t actually thinking of that.\nBARSET: Then what were you thinking?\nDOCTOR: The Ice Warriors think we’re dead. Come on, let’s make mischief.\nARAKSSOR: Good, good. The planet’s gases are changing. Colder, yes, colder. Now boosting power direct from the reactor to the cannon.\nGENEVIEVE: They are firing the cannon.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’s starting to have an effect on the atmosphere.\nGENEVIEVE: Ah, what was that?\nBARSET: It’s ice. Chunks of ice. Are they causing an avalanche with that thing?\nDOCTOR: Giant frozen hail. Come on, before we get hit. This way. It’s over here.\nGENEVIEVE: Lord Barset, quickly.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, help me with him.\nGENEVIEVE: It knocked him straight out.\nDOCTOR: Lord Barset. Lord Barset!\nGENEVIEVE: Is he dead?\nDOCTOR: No. Come on, we’re going to have to carry him. We'll put him in one of the small chambers and come back for him later.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I thought so\nGENEVIEVE: What?\nDOCTOR: The Ice Warriors have ripped out the heat emitter power lines. Not big fans of heat. Right, home is where the hearth is. Now, if I can take this emitter into the Tardis, we can... oh no. My key. Where’s my key? I must have put it in my pocket. In my pocket! Where’s my pocket? These are not my clothes.\nGENEVIEVE: Wait a minute. Is this what you wanted?\nDOCTOR: Where did you get that?\nGENEVIEVE: Well, it was just sticking out of that thing when we found it. To be honest, I just put it in my pocket and forgot all about it. Are you sure this is all you need to open a spaceship? A key?\nDOCTOR: Why not give it a try?\nDOCTOR: Now, I’ve got work to do.\nGENEVIEVE: Er, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Yes?\nGENEVIEVE: It’s just... we did get inside that Police Box, didn’t we? That small Police Box?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes.\nGENEVIEVE: Yes, I thought so. Yes, okay.\nARAKSSOR: Report, Ssrongar.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: My sentries report they have found the wreckage of the flying craft. There are no bodies.\nARAKSSOR: And there has been a report of movement in the main chamber.\nSSRONGAR: [OC]: I will investigate immediately.\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nGENEVIEVE: What’s all that technology actually doing?\nDOCTOR: It’s scanning for any spaceship within transmission range, which gives me time to attach the heat emitter to this battery. Pass me that wire, would you?\nGENEVIEVE: So I’m guessing you’ve remembered quite a lot.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, quite a lot, yes. It was that noise.\nGENEVIEVE: Recognition code, unlocking the secrets of your mind.\nDOCTOR: Genevieve Marceau. (kiss, kiss, kiss)\nGENEVIEVE: Yes, okay, you can remember my whole name now. I’m very impressed.\nDOCTOR: No, you’re a genius. The wave form of the distress signal will have certain characteristics in it. You know, bits of sound common to all Martian technology. That’s the key to finding an Ice Warrior’s spaceship. Here, hold this emitter.\nGENEVIEVE: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: The sound of the signal is in my mind. I’m connecting to the telepathic circuits of the Tardis.\nGENEVIEVE: Your ship is telepathic?\nDOCTOR: Telepathic, and travels in Time and Space. And there’s a very nice swimming pool. Sometimes.\nDOCTOR: 18’ OFFICER [OC]: Ben, any luck with getting through to the Naval Patrol?\nBEN: Nothing, sir. The storm seems to be messing everything up. What are we going to do?\nBEN: 18’ OFFICER [OC]: We just have to sit tight. Weather’s too bad to take the Fortitude out to sea.\nBEN: I know. Have you ever seen anything like it? Those hailstones are like footballs. Have you seen those clouds? Looks like the end of the bleeding world. I hope you’re all right out there, Mademoiselle.\nDOCTOR: Look, there on the scanner. You see?\nGENEVIEVE: That looks like the Milky Way.\nDOCTOR: It is. But there, look. That little blinking light.\nGENEVIEVE: An Ice Warrior spaceship?\nDOCTOR: An Ice Warrior spaceship, and it’s within reasonable range.\nGENEVIEVE: Reasonable? But that looks like it’s on the other side of the galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Oh, not all that far really. I mean, they have hyperdrive, you know. Now, I'll just have to make a note of those coordinates. Right. Must remember those.\nGENEVIEVE: Perhaps you ought to write them down.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. I have an excellent memory. Well, now I have. I think.\nGENEVIEVE: So what now?\nDOCTOR: I reactivate and boost the distress signal. But in order to do that I'll have to use reactor power, and that’s what Arakssor is using to power his sonic cannon.\nGENEVIEVE: He’s not going to be very pleased if you have unplug his cannon, then.\nDOCTOR: Quite. Now, what’s outside? Just adjust the scanner. Oh dear.\nGENEVIEVE: An Ice Warrior.\nDOCTOR: Come on. Time to take the initiative. Hand me that heat emitter.\nDOCTOR: Hello. Good afternoon.\nICE WARRIOR: Do not move.\nDOCTOR: What, not even to do this?\nICE WARRIOR: Anh! Sss. Aiiee. (Sonic weapon)\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Not a very good shot when he’s having a hot flush, is he?\nGENEVIEVE: Is he dead?\nDOCTOR: Just a bit pooped out, I think. Right, now, get the other batteries from the Tardis and wire them up to all the other emitters here, then switch on. As quick as you can.\nGENEVIEVE: What are you going to be doing?\nDOCTOR: Putting my bare-faced cheek into a lion’s mouth.\nARAKSSOR: Soon the effects will be irreversible. Their scientists will realise, and then it will be time to issue my ultimatum.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry to pour hot water on your plans\nARAKSSOR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But one of your warships is on its way here.\nARAKSSOR: You lie.\nDOCTOR: I saw it in my craft. I'll show you if you don’t believe me.\nARAKSSOR: I do not believe you. You worked with those traitors against me. Those who deposed and imprisoned me.\nDOCTOR: And now they’re homing in on the bearing of that signal. I can show you their position.\nARAKSSOR: I could destroy them with the sonic cannon.\nDOCTOR: Presssssssiccccly.\nARAKSSOR: Why would you help us?\nDOCTOR: To save the human race. You’re destroying their atmosphere.\nARAKSSOR: The human race will survive as my slave army\nDOCTOR: But how many will perish before they submit? If you redirect your cannon now, the humans will be saved.\nARAKSSOR: For the present. And you would risk your life to give them this brief respite? Such an action is pointless.\nDOCTOR: Is mercy pointless?\nARAKSSOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there we differ.\nARAKSSOR: I do not trust you, Doctor, or your craft. You will come with me to the communications chamber and show me this so-called ship.\nGENEVIEVE: Right, okay Jenny, that’s it I think. Ah, cross your fingers, Doctor. Let’s see if we can heat things up a little bit. It's working! Mon Dieu, it’s working.\nBARSET: Jenny, what the hell’s been going on? I woke up in some chamber or something.\nGENEVIEVE: Lord Barset.\nBARSET: Did you leave me for dead?\nGENEVIEVE: No, but we had things to do and\nBARSET: Where’s that mad Doctor? What’s he doing?\nDOCTOR: You’ll have to siphon off some of your reactor power.\nARAKSSOR: Do not presume to lecture me. I know... I Know what... what I’m doing.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I was right, though, wasn’t I? So that lever controls the flow of energy from your reactor, does it? How do you reassign the power to different tasks? This panel?\nARAKSSOR: Silence. Show me the coordinates of the warship.\nDOCTOR: Oh, temper, temper.\nGENEVIEVE: Look, you’ve caused enough trouble here, Barset. Just sit down and be quiet.\nBARSET: You've no right to speak to me like that. I paid you well, didn’t 1? Well, didn’t I?\nGENEVIEVE: That’s the trouble with you. You think money is everything.\nBARSET: No, no, no, no, that’s the trouble with the world. I’m just a victim of it, and that’s what I wanted to change. I wanted to free mankind from all that rubbish by giving them new technologies, new ways Of living.\nGENEVIEVE: Yes, maybe, but you wanted it to be you doing the giving, like some great benefactor, like the saviour of the human race.\nBARSET: I don’t have to listen to this. We’re wasting time. I’m a man of action and I’m going to put things right.\nGENEVIEVE: Where are you going?\nBARSET: The Ice Warriors have left plenty of my men’s guns around here, so...\nGENEVIEVE: What the hell do you think you’re doing?\nBARSET: I’m going to put my money where my mouth is and go straight to the top.\nGENEVIEVE: Oh no. Oh no!\nARAKSSOR: And those are the coordinates?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m proud to say I remembered every digit. Oh now then, don’t get overheated.\nARAKSSOR: The temperature. What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Getting a little hot for you, is it?\nARAKSSOR: These coordinates. That warship is far too distant from this planet ever to have picked up that weak distress signal.\nDOCTOR: I know, which is why it needs a little boost!\nARAKSSOR: No!\nDOCTOR: If you choke me, I'll never turn the heat down..\nARAKSSOR: You cannot trick... trick me. You must not... must not... The heat... (thud)\nDOCTOR: Yes. Awful when the thermostat gets stuck, isn’t it? Now, where was I? Hmm.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, there you are. Good old faith.\nDOCTOR: Get off me!\nARAKSSOR: I’m not finished yet, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But... but you’re weakening.\nGENEVIEVE: Zut! That’s it, damn it. No more heat. Okay, okay. Right, here goes.\nARAKSSOR: My strength is returning, Doctor. My warriors have foiled your pathetic plan, whatever it is, and now you will die.\nBARSET: Let him go, Arakssor.\nDOCTOR: Lord Barset.\nBARSET: I don’t know what your plan is, Doctor, but you’d better get on with it.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, your Lordship. Just one final boost.\nBARSET: Stay where you are, Arakssor, or I fire at point-blank range.\nDOCTOR: It’s getting cold again, Lord Barset, so watch him, he’s getting stronger.\nBARSET: (weak) Doctor. Doctor, stop him.\nDOCTOR: You owed that man your revival!\nARAKSSOR: He was a fool, and so are you, Doctor. I grow tired of your continuing existence.\nCOMMANDER: [OC]: Red 0089 responding to Blue distress code 442. Code Arakssor. Respond.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Red zero whoever you are, Arakssor has escaped.\nARAKSSOR: Silence!\nDOCTOR: Too late.\nCOMMANDER: [OC]: Your identity is confirmed, Arakssor. The distress call is verified. Where is Geldar?\nARAKSSOR: He is dead. Executed as all traitors should be. Which side are you on, Commander? The side of our people’s true destiny of power, of glory, or are you of the cringing creed who failed to imprison me? Come, join me.\nCOMMANDER: [OC]: Your sentence was life imprisonment. The penalty for escape is death. Sentence to be carried out immediately.\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute! What are you doing? You’re bombarding us from space. Commander, listen to me.\nCOMMANDER: [OC]: The affairs of this primitive planet do not concern us.\nDOCTOR: Commander!\nARAKSSOR: It would seem your sentence is death too, Doctor, but you will die first by my hand.\nDOCTOR: Which one, left or right?\nDOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Genevieve.\nGENEVIEVE: Doctor, quick. This whole place is blowing up. What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Look out, Jenny!\nGENEVIEVE: Let’s get out of here.\nDOCTOR: Come on, we’ve got to get back to the Tardis.\nGENEVIEVE: Will we be safe in there?\nDOCTOR: If we get there in (crash) in time.\nARAKSSOR: The final treachery, but my ideas live on. One day my people will rise again, and another will take my place. It is in our blood to conquer. Argh!\nARAKSSOR: 18’ OFFICER: All hands prepare to cast off. All hands prepare to cast off.\nBEN: Who is it?\nGENEVIEVE: [OC]: Who were you expecting?\nGENEVIEVE: Hello, Ben.\nBEN: Bon bleeding jour, Mademoiselle! Where the heck did you spring from? We thought you were, well, you know. We waited, but when we found the dig site blown up and well, I mean... Oh crikey, how did you get back?\nGENEVIEVE: The Doctor brought me.\nBEN: The Doctor, yeah. How’s he doing?\nGENEVIEVE: Oh, you know, as fine as ever.\nBEN: As ever? What’d you mean?\nGENEVIEVE: How long did you wait, Ben?\nBEN: How long? I don’t get you.\nGENEVIEVE: Well, it’s a simple enough question.\nBEN: Well, we’ve been here about a week since the explosions, then the storm stopped. We sent a chopper out to look for survivors. Couldn’t find a thing. Everything was blown to pieces. But, I mean, where’ve you been for the last few days, then?\nGENEVIEVE: The past few days? You know, somehow it seems longer.\nBEN: Yeah, I suppose it does. Where is the Doctor, anyway?\nGENEVIEVE: Oh, you know.\nBEN: No. No, I don’t know as it goes, Mademoiselle. That’s why I was asking. Here, are you all right?\nGENEVIEVE: All right? Why do you ask?\nBEN: Well, you look... you look kinda... I dunno. Kinda dreamy.\nGENEVIEVE: Yeah, I suppose I am kind of dreamy. It’s like I've had a dream.\nBEN: And the Doctor?\nGENEVIEVE: Oh, he’s er... vanished.\nBEN: Vanished?\nGENEVIEVE: Yes, Ben. And now I’m awake. So, make me some of your worst coffee. I’ve missed it."
