Are you ready to drive them back?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 9\nCLANSMEN: (RAGGEDLY) Aye!!!\nDOCTOR: Wait, wait. For heaven’s sake, look, they’re bringing up a cannon! You’1ll be blown to pieces.\nGUTHRIE: We have to keep them from the village, we’ve women and bairns here.\nDOCTOR: If you tackle those Redcoats head-on you won’t get within a hundred yards. At least put a defensive line there, by your carts. Then send men up the slope there, see? That way you can’t be flanked.\nGUTHRIE: Aye, that might work, Frenchman. But Black Donald says we’re to attack, and we Mackintoshes will not yield. (CALLS OFF) Are you ready, boys? Loch Moigh!!\nCLANSMEN: Loch Moigh!!\nDOCTOR: No! It’s suicide!\nDOCTOR: Look out!\nDOCTOR: AAAAARGH!\nDOCTOR: CUT TO SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: HOLD, THEN SLOWLY FADE UP ON...\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. HIGHLAND VILLAGE —- DAY\nRILKE: Let’s be having you! Come on, wake up.\nDOCTOR: (COMING ROUND) Hm, what... ?\nRILKE: On your feet!\nDOCTOR: Alright, let me check I’ve got all my limbs first.\nHEYWARD: (FX: APPROACHING ON HORSEBACK, SCATTERING A FEW CHICKENS) What’s that you’ve got there, Sergeant?\nRILKE: Sir! Found it shamming dead among the chickens.\nDOCTOR: I was not shamming! I was actually unconscious!\nHEYWARD: (HORSEBACK) Who are you? (BEAT) Out with it!\nDOCTOR: What happened to the man I was talking to? Where are the villagers?\nHEYWARD: Dead, most likely. Now answer the question. You look French.\nDOCTOR: I am not French!\nHEYWARD: A Yankee, then?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Look, what year is this? Seventeen forty, seventeen fifty?\nHEYWARD: Are you a simpleton or are you just trying my patience? This is the year seventeen hundred and eighty.\nDOCTOR: And you are?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 11\nHEYWARD: You, sir, are addressing Major Heyward of His Majesty’s 78\" Regiment of Foot. Now, if you are a doctor, I have injured that need attending to.\nDOCTOR: I’m not that kind of doctor.\nRILKE: Any kind is better than the sawbones we’ve got.\nHEYWARD: Exactly. And it’s either that or I have you shot as a Jacobean\nHEYWARD: spy.\nDOCTOR: (HEAVY SIGH) Doesn’t matter where it is, or what period, does it? There’s always some tinpot tyrant ready to solve every problem with a gun.\nHEYWARD: What did you say?\nDOCTOR: Never mind.\nHEYWARD: ‘Where it is or what period’! That strikes me as an odd turn of phrase, sir. I think our Overlord will want to talk to you.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nHEYWARD: Sergeant, take this man to our injured. And keep him under guard.\nRILKE: You heard the Major.\nDOCTOR: Who exactly is this Overlord of yours?\nRILKE: You best not ask questions like that, less’n you want to know the answer. And take it from me, you don’t. Now do what you can for these men.\nDOCTOR: Yes but...!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 12\nINJURED: (SOME WAY OFF) Help me! Help me please. (COUGHING AND\nSPLUTTERING: )\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT. HILLS ABOVE VILLAGE —- DAY.\nGUTHRIE: (APPROACHING) Black Donald! Thank God you’ve come!\nJAMIE: Will Guthrie. How went the battle?\nGUTHRIE: We attacked, but Heyward’s men drove us from the village.\nJAMIE: That butcher. How many men has he?\nGUTHRIE: Four-score, maybe even a hundred. They were too many for us, Donald.\nJAMIE: But still — you attacked them head-on? What were you thinking, man? It’d be suicide.\nGUTHRIE: Aye, I see that now. The Frenchman said as much.\nJAMIE: Frenchman?\nGUTHRIE: Aye, came into the village before the attack.\nJAMIE: Well, take what men you have left and hit their flank yonder, see?\nGUTHRIE: Aye, I do.\nJAMIE: Half my men will take them on the other side. I’1l1 bring the rest through the village. If you find Heyward, leave him to me. (TO\nHIS: MEN) Let the pipes play!\nHIS: For Scotland, and for our freedom!\nCLANSMEN: For Scotland! (DESCENDING INTO ROWDY CHEERS)\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. HIGHLAND VILLAGE —- DAY\nINJURED: (WEAK, PAINED) In God’s name, sawbones — make it stop...\nDOCTOR: Easy now. There’s water here —\nDOCTOR: Not too fast —\nRILKE: (OFF) Oh my eye! Highlanders! It must be Black Donald’s men. (CALLS OFF) Quickly, to your firing lines!\nHEYWARD: (OFF) Form up there!\nDOCTOR: From the frying pan into the fire, it would seem.\nHEYWARD: (OFF) There’s too many of them! Withdraw! Withdraw!\nINJURED: Black Donald. He’s a terror, he’ll murder us —\nDOCTOR: Not if I’ve got anything to do with it.\nRILKE: (OFF) Withdraw! Come on, get a move on, unless you want those kilted devils to slit yer throats for you! Withdraw!\nRILKE: (FX: HEYWARD’S HORSE THUNDERS OFF. RUNNING FOOTSTEPS AND CRIES OF\nREDCOATS: RETREATING. )\nREDCOATS: (VARIOUSLY) Come on! Withdraw! Move it! Let’s get out of here!\nRILKE: (FAR OFF NOW) Leave the wounded!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 15\nINJURED: For pity’s sake, don’t leave me-!\nDOCTOR: I’m not planning to.\nGUTHRIE: (RUNS UP, OUT OF BREATH) Well I’1l be, it’s the Frenchman! You've got prisoners then, eh?\nINJURED: (WEAKER THAN EVER) Mercy-!\nGUTHRIE: Sure. (FX: COCKING PISTOL) I’1ll ease your pain —\nDOCTOR: No-!!!\nDOCTOR: That’s murder-!\nGUTHRIE: Aye, the same way they murder us.\nDOCTOR: An eye for an eye, ‘til we all go blind — is that it?\nGUTHRIE: Ah, with wounds like that, the dog’d never have lasted the night.\nDOCTOR: I understand you have no love of the English, but he was still a man.\nGUTHRIE: It’s hard these days to tell men from puppets.\nDOCTOR: ‘Puppets.’ Of King George the Second, I suppose?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 16\nGUTHRIE: The King?!? What does the King want in all this?\nDOCTOR: I assumed this rebellion is against the Highland Clearances, and for the restoration of James Stuart?\nGUTHRIE: No, man — that was my father’s battle. Come on, Black Donald will want to see you.\nDOCTOR: Black Donald?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT. HIGHLAND VILLAGE\nJAMIE: (TALKING TO LIEUTENANTS) Put pickets out beyond the village. Find out which way Heyward went and quickly before—\nGUTHRIE: (APPROACHING) Donald! This is the Frenchman I was telling you about.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Black Donald, is it? Well, Mr Donald, or whoever you are — I want a word with you about proper treatment of the injured — (STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, SEEING JAMIE) Good grief.\nJAMIE: He doesn’t sound like a Frenchman. (SNIFFS) Or smell like one.\nJAMIE: Don’t you worry yourself, Frenchman. The wounded will be seen to.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’ve seen the way this fellow ‘sees to’ the wounded. And I can’t believe you of all people [would condone —]\nJAMIE: Will Guthrie. What’s he on about-?\nGUTHRIE: Aye, well, we can barely feed ourselves, let alone the English wounded.\nJAMIE: We’re not Heyward, Will Guthrie. Not butchers. You’1ll share your ration among the injured now.\nGUTHRIE: But —\nJAMIE: I said, now!\nGUTHRIE: Donald. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR: Well said —\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 18\nJAMIE: You. What’s your business here?\nDOCTOR: Of course... you wouldn’t recognise me.\nJAMIE: I’ve not clapped eyes on you before.\nDOCTOR: No, no.. of course not. This is going to be a little difficult to explain... And judging by the look of you, it probably happened... what? Twenty, thirty years ago?\nJAMIE: What happened twenty, thirty years ago?\nDOCTOR: But that can’t be right. Not if the Clearances are happening now. Hmmm.\nJAMIE: You’d better start making some sense, Frenchie.\nDOCTOR: Look... I’m the Doctor. Does that mean anything to you?\nJAMIE: Means you charge a pretty penny for a compress and a powder.\nDOCTOR: Mind you, I looked different back then.\nJAMIE: Back when?\nDOCTOR: When we first met. The year was 1745. It was just after the Battle of Culloden. I was... er, shorter, then, with dark hair and... (THIS MIGHT JOG HIS MEMORY!) I had two friends with me, Polly and Ben. Remember? She was a long-legged beanpole of a thing, he was a sailor...\nJAMIE: Sailors and beanpoles. (TURNING) Ah, I don’t have time for this —\nDOCTOR: Jamie... It’s me!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 19\nJAMIE: (STOPPING IN HIS TRACKS) What did you call me-?\nDOCTOR: It is you, isn’t it? Jamie McCrimmon.\nJAMIE: My name is Black Donald! What are you, an English spy?\nDOCTOR: James Robert McCrimmon, son of Donald, and a piper like his father. You served the Laird Colin McLaren at Culloden.\nJAMIE: (SPOOKED) How do you know this?\nDOCTOR: I know it because I was your friend.\nJAMIE: Was?\nDOCTOR: It’s difficult to explain.. In a way, we knew each other for a long time, but the Time Lords made you forget—\nJAMIE: ‘Time Lords’? What nonsense are ye speakin’ now?\nDOCTOR: (FRUSTRATED) Oh, this is ridiculous, you’1ll never believe me... But... Oh Jamie, I thought... I thought you were dead.\nJAMIE: Indeed we are.\nDOCTOR: What?\nJAMIE: All that live in this blighted place are already dead.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean? Jamie, when I knew you, you were one of the most ‘alive’ people I’d met—\nJAMIE: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: You had such a spirit of.. of hope and—\nJAMIE: Follow me, Doctor. There’s somethin’ I need to show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE —- DAY.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT OF CLIMBING) This is rather a steep climb, Jamie!\nJAMIE: We’re here! And tell me it wasn’t worth the sweat?\nDOCTOR: It’s a fantastic view!\nJAMIE: It is that. But it’s not what you can see that I brought you here for. It’s what you can’t see.\nDOCTOR: And what exactly can’t I see?\nJAMIE: Over there, at the far edge of the Kelpie’s Flow, that was the village of Leanoch. Across the peak, on the other side of the Lammermoor Estate, there was Car Mor. In the valley there, almost a hundred families lived at Breac. All gone now.\nDOCTOR: The Highland Clearances? Not a very honourable moment in British history.\nJAMIE: Aye, but there’s another hand controlling the Redcoats.\nDOCTOR: Er... What’s the sword for? Jamie?\nJAMIE: I don’t know how you found out my true name, but I will, before this day is done. Now — who are you? Guthrie said you appeared out of the air in a blue box, is that right?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS, yes. Jamie, don’t you remember anything of—?\nJAMIE: Did that fiend Red Cap send you? Speak up, man, or I’1l split you from belly to breakfast and throw you off this mountain!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR: Threaten me all you like, Jamie, but something decidedly odd is going on here. And I’m rather hoping that you’1l explain it all to me. That Major down there—?\nJAMIE: Heyward?\nDOCTOR: Yes, he mentioned the ‘Overlord’. Is this Overlord behind all this?\nJAMIE: I’ve heard the name, but he’s not who I blame for this. Heyward and the Red Cap are the ones.\nDOCTOR: Red Cap?\nJAMIE: I’ve only seen him once and even then he moved so quickly I couldn’t tell you what he looked like, other than his cap of blood. But the five men in front of me were mown down like grass.\nDOCTOR: A cap of blood?\nJAMIE: That’s what I said. He drains the blood of his victims. More than that, his infernal machines are draining the very blood of Scotland itself.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Redcap, redcap.. (ALOUD) Of course, a creature of myth. A murderous goblin who slays travellers who stray from [the path —]\nJAMTE: Red Cap is no myth!\nDOCTOR: Alright, alright. But will you please put that sword down, Jamie? I’ve no wish to have my belly slit and, as it happens, I haven’t had breakfast.\nJAMIE: Very well, but tread carefully Doctor. I don’t trust you.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: So I see. But perhaps you could show this Red Cap to me.\nJAMIE: You want to see him?\nDOCTOR: If he’s the cause of everything that’s going wrong here... yes.\nJAMIE: (LAUGHS) My men and I have tried to rid ourselves of him for years, and you, a French dandy...\nDOCTOR: For the last time, I am not a Frenchman!\nJAMIE: And you, a dandy, are going to walk up to his castle and do what, exactly, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, if you must know... Put a stop to whatever he’s doing to corrupt this timeline. (BEAT) Well, you did ask.\nJAMIE: ‘Time... line’? You’re saying you know a way to rid us of the Red Cap?\nDOCTOR: I’m saying I’m determined to find a way, and that the first step towards that is actually getting the measure of this... creature.\nJAMIE: Alright, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You’1l take me to him?\nJAMIE: I’1l take you. But I won’t risk the lives of any more of my men.\nDOCTOR: Quite right. We won’t need them anyway. It’1ll be just the two of us. (DELIGHTED) Quite like old times.\nJAMIE: What old times? There’s something strange about you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: You do trust me though, don’t you? Hm? Or at least you want to trust me. I can see it in your eyes.\nJAMIE: Och, you’re a sorcerer and that’s for sure!\nDOCTOR: No sorcery, Jamie. Just friendship. You see, when we knew each other before—\nJAMIE: I’ve told ya, I don’t remember anything about you or—\nDOCTOR: I know... I know... But hear me out, Jamie. I know you want to.\nJAMIE: Oh, do you now?\nDOCTOR: We were friends, you know. I put my life in your hands many times... and you trusted yours in mine. Perhaps I can’t explain in any way you’1ll truly understand.. All I can ask is that you follow your instincts, Jamie McCrimmon. Can you do that?\nJAMIE: I’m no’ makin’ any promises. Follow me.\nJAMIE: it\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. THE HIGHLANDS - DAY\nDOCTOR: I’d forgotten how beautiful Scotland is. Look at that sunset!\nJAMIE: It’s not all like this. Red Cap has blighted the land.\nDOCTOR: Exactly what does he look like?\nJAMIE: He’s a short fellow with leathery skin, as though he’s been on the moors too long. His hair is long and grey. He owes his name to the red hat he wears. It’s said he dips it in the blood of his victims.\nDOCTOR: I see. Sounds decidedly odd.\nJAMIE: And he’s fast! Even though he wears iron boots.\nDOCTOR: Iron boots?\nJAMIE: You can hear him coming but you can’t outrun him. At night you can see the sparks his boots raise. And he can overcome even the strongest man.\nDOCTOR: I’m not saying he isn’t real, but it sounds to me like someone has taken on the appearance of a myth to strike fear into people.\nJAMIE: Whatever he is, it works.\nDOCTOR: (WRYLY) And what about Black Donald? Is he a myth as well?\nJAMIE: (LAUGHS) Black Donald is what people here call the Devil. To the Redcoats that’s what I am, so that’s who I became.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you have a family somewhere, a home?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 26\nJAMIE: The Highlands are my home. My countrymen are my family. That’s all I need.\nDOCTOR: (SAD) I see...\nJAMIE: But we must go, it’1ll be dark before we get off this mountain. And be on your guard — Mullach Castle, Red Cap’s lair, is just over yon ridge.\nDOCTOR: A castle! Well that’s appropriate, I suppose. An important man\nDOCTOR: must have an important house.\nJAMIE: Aye, and it’s not without defences.\nDOCTOR: Soldiers? Redcoats?\nJAMTE: Some of them were, once.\nDOCTOR: ‘Once’?\nJAMIE: We'll be safe if we keep moving. But keep your voice down.\nJAMIE: FADE.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT. FADE UP\nDOCTOR: I can’t see a thing!\nJAMIE: We must lay on.\nDOCTOR: Quite an unnatural mist rising up... (SNIFFS) I was rather enjoying stretching my legs in the fresh air, but it’s suddenly lost its appeal. (STUMBLES) Ow! This is absurd. I can’t even see where I’m putting my feet.\nJAMIE: (AGITATED) We have to keep moving.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, what is it?\nJAMIE: Down there is Gladsmuir. There was a battle there, a Jacobite victory and a glorious day by all accounts. But hundreds were killed, on both sides.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But I really don’t see how that affects—\nJAMIE: There are nights when the dead walk!\nDOCTOR: Ghosts? You’re expecting me to believe in ghosts?\nJAMIE: Call them what you will but they exist. Listen!.. Do you hear that? The pipes? Can you not hear the pipes?\nDOCTOR: Well, yes! Yes I can, but—\nJAMIE: He’s come for us!\nDOCTOR: Who?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 28\nJAMIE: We’ve got to get down. I’ve got to get away from here. Come on!\nDOCTOR: We can’t run in this fog! It’s too dangerous. We have to sit it out.\nJAMIE: You heard the piper! He calls the dead.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, the only threat I can see is us falling and breaking our necks. This piper could, I don’t know, be... somebody just practising!\nJAMIE: No-one lives out here, not anymore.\nDOCTOR: (TENSE) What was that? .. Oh, you see! You’ve got me at it now.\nJAMIE: No, there! In the fog. Do you not see it?\nDOCTOR: Shadows. Just shadows in fog.\nJAMIE: No, that’s a man! I’m sure of it.\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nJAMIE: There he is again. Closer this time.\nDOCTOR: (RATTLED) I hear it. But we’ve got to stay calm.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 29\nJAMIE: (WHISPERS) It’s the Phantom Piper. He’s come for me. And if you can hear him then... he’s come for us both.\nDOCTOR: The McCrimmon Piper?\nJAMIE: How do you know that?\nDOCTOR: Jamie, I know this is hard for you to understand, but—\nJAMIE: They’re coming for us! (MOVING OFF) We must go.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, wait. Jamie!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE — CONTINUOUS.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Jamie, will you please stop-???\nJAMIE: There’s no time, we’ve got to... (SLIPS) Agh!\nJAMIE: (DANGLING) Ah... my God! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) I’m coming, I’m coming. Where are you?\nJAMIE: Here.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, good heavens! I didn’t realise we were so close to the edge! Take my hand!\nJAMIE: I can’t... I can’t let go. I was right Doctor, the Piper was coming for me.\nDOCTOR: No, he’s not. Listen to me... Once before, a long time ago, you thought you saw the Piper. But you had a fever, you saw a metal man, a Cyberman. It was no piper. This is the same, the imagination playing tricks. Shadows in the fog; wind through the mountains. Nothing more. Now take my hand.\nJAMIE: I can’t...\nDOCTOR: Reach!\nJAMIE: ARGH!\nDOCTOR: (OVER) Gotcha!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 31\nJAMIE: (BREATHLESS) You saved my life!\nDOCTOR: (EXERTED) I’ve done it before. Quite a few times actually.\nJAMIE: When? (DISBELIEVING) Oh aye, when you knew me before!\nDOCTOR: I think it’s time we got off this rather uncanny mountain, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Jamie?\nJAMIE: Thanks again, for saving my life.\nDOCTOR: You’re welcome, Jamie. (MUSIC: A PASSAGE OF TIME.)\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY. FADE UP.\nJAMTE: I’ve told you! I’ve no met you before. Not even if you did look shorter or had different hair.. and two friends, and that’s a fact!\nDOCTOR: Which is odd.\nJAMIE: Oh, odd, is it? And why is that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (CONFLICTED, ALMOST TO HIMSELF) Well... Hmmm... I’m not sure I should even tell you. I’m not sure I should risk upsetting what the Time Lords—\nJAMIE: Ah, them again. There’s only one lord I’ve heard talked about around these parts, and that’s the Overlord.\nDOCTOR: And that’s the point. What Overlord? There was no ‘Overlord’ during this time period in Scotland.\nJAMIE: ‘Time period’?\nDOCTOR: There weren’t any Clearances, either. This whole situation is feeling more and more like a temporal foldback distortion as every minute passes.\nJAMIE: Would you like to take a shot at explaining that too?\nDOCTOR: No. But even though the Time Lords erased your memory, their erasure took effect after our first encounter. So you should at least have a short memory of me, from before we left in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 33\nJAMIE: Look, Doctor, I can remember my whole life, everything as it was and as it should be.\nDOCTOR: Hmmm...\nDOCTOR: Someone’s interfering, and it must have something to do with Redcap and this Overlord person.\nJAMIE: Iron heels!\nDOCTOR: ‘Tron’— ?\nJAMIE: Listen!\nDOCTOR: That sounds like a train.\nJAMIE: What is a ‘train’?\nDOCTOR: Of course, we’re a few years too early—\nJAMIE: That’s Red Cap, Doctor. Remember I told you he has iron boots? That’s what you can hear. He’s running. Quickly now! Get down behind these rocks.\nJAMIE: (SOTTO) Wait... I think... He’s moving away, I think. Yes. (SIGH OF\nRELIEF: )\nDOCTOR: Get down, Jamie. Redcoats.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MARCH PAST CONTINUES. A BODY OF 100+ TROOPS MARCH PAST. HORSES AND CARTS. )\nDOCTOR: How many, do you think?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 34\nJAMIE: Two hundred perhaps. Company strength. Perfect spot for an ambush too! And here I am with one sword and a mad doctor.\nDOCTOR: Where are they off to, the castle?\nJAMIE: Aye, they work under his control.\nDOCTOR: The Red Cap’s control?\nJAMIE: Aye.\nDOCTOR: So he’s the one clearing the Highlands. The question is why? Where do the people he clears out go to?\nJAMIE: Some to the city, others to work at Red Cap’s horseheads.\nDOCTOR: Horseheads? What do you mean, horseheads?\nJAMIE: Machines, like great animals. They gather in herds, sucking the blood from the land. If we carry on, you’1ll see them for yourself soon enough.\nDOCTOR: The sooner I get to the bottom of all this, the better. Hullo... I recognize—\nHEYWARD: (FAR OFF) Move on there! No talking in the ranks!\nJAMIE: Butcher Heyward! There’s a man I’d like at the point of my sword.\nDOCTOR: Ah, look, this is what we need, the baggage carts.\nJAMIE: What of it?\nDOCTOR: If these Redcoats are making for the Castle, then that’s the quickest way there.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 35\nJAMIE: You mean jump on one of those? What if we’re seen?\nDOCTOR: Then I expect I’1ll be shot as a French spy and you as a brigand. Come on, it beats walking. (MOVING OFF)\nJAMIE: (TO HIMSELF) This Doctor doesn’t lack for courage, I’1ll give him that.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY.\nHEYWARD: Move on men. Not much further now.\nRILKE: Major Heyward, sir.\nHEYWARD: What is it, Sergeant?\nRILKE: We’ve caught a couple of Highlanders shadowing the column, sir.\nHEYWARD: Out here! Well, have them shot.\nRILKE: Begging your pardon, sir... They claim they want to work for the Cap. And they say they have, ‘Important information,’ sir!\nHEYWARD: Hm. Oh very well, bring them here.\nRILKE: (OFF) Alright, you two. And mind your manners when you’re speaking to the Major.\nGUTHRIE: (APPR) Major, we want to work for you sir. We want to work for Red Cap.\nHIGHLANDER: Aye, Sir.\nHEYWARD: Do you really! And why would you want to do that, you filthy Highland scum?\nGUTHRIE: Me and Fergus here — we want to work, sir, we want to eat. We’re so hungry.\nHIGHLANDER: So hungry.\nHEYWARD: Sergeant, get rid of them.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 37\nGUTHRIE: No sir, no sir, wait sir, please. I’ve got news, news I have!\nHEYWARD: About what?\nGUTHRIE: Black Donald, sir, Black Donald is coming this way with a Frenchman who’s a doctor.\nHEYWARD: A doctor! Yes, yes I know this man. And he’s coming here? Why?\nGUTHRIE: Don’t know that sir, they just said they was coming. But I can give him to you, yes I can, Will Guthrie can hand him to you on skillet, sir!\nHEYWARD: Sergeant — give this man some food. Have the other one shot.\nHIGHLANDER: What? But—\nRILKE: Major.\nHIGHLANDER: No, no, please — (CONTINUES UNDER)\nGUTHRIE: Thank you sir, thank you.\nRILKE: (MOVING AWAY) Come on you dog, let’s get this over with.\nHIGHLANDER: (DRAGGED AWAY) No, no please, God no.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: EXT. HIGHLANDS/CART - DAY.\nDOCTOR: Did you hear that?\nJAMIE: All I can hear is an axle that needs grease.\nDOCTOR: Yes, this isn’t as comfortable as I imagined it would be.\nJAMIE: ‘It beats walking’!\nDOCTOR: Hmm. So how much further is it?\nJAMIE: Shouldn’t be too far.\nJAMIE: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Taking a look. If we’re close then... Good grief!\nJAMIE: What?\nDOCTOR: Are these your horseheads?\nJAMIE: Let me see... Aye, that’s them. Was I not right? Monstrous beasts sucking the life from the land.\nDOCTOR: You’re not far wrong. They’re pumpjacks. Machines that lift liquid out of a well.\nJAMIE: Aye, I've seen... The black water, the blood of Scotland.\nDOCTOR: Black yes, but blood no. Come on, let’s get a closer look.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: EXT. PUMPING FIELD - DAY.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: PUMPJACKS, CLOSER NOW. FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND JAMIE APPROACH. )\nJAMIE: This is a bad place. I can smell it.\nDOCTOR: (SNIFFS) Yes. Be careful not to breathe in too deeply.\nJAMIE: Aye, the reek of the black water.\nDOCTOR: It’s not water, Jamie, it’s oil... at least I think it is. It’1ll be much sought after in another hundred years or so, but—\nJAMIE: For what?\nDOCTOR: Oh, getting about, plastics, lubricants, all sorts of things. (MUSING) So.. this Red Cap is an oil baron, an old fashioned speculator. Though I’m not sure why he’s in this era other than to beat the rush. Jamie, what are you doing over—?\nJAMIE: Doctor look here! I’ve found something.\nDOCTOR: What is it? — Oh no.\nJAMIE: Some blue box. Hey, didn’t Will Guthrie say —\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s my TARDIS. What’s she doing here?\nJAMIE: TAR-DIS?\nDOCTOR: My ship. Believe it or not, Jamie, this was your home for a number of years.\nJAMIE: As if I'd live for years in a wee box.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) But how did you get here, old girl, eh?\nJAMTE: Doctor, look out!\nHEYWARD: Because I had it brought here, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Major Heyward! And why precisely would you do that?\nGUTHRIE: (EMERGING) Didn’t I tell you, sir?\nJAMIE: Guthrie!?!\nGUTHRIE: Didn’t I tell you you’d catch him if you brought his magic box?\nJAMTE: You traitor, Guthrie!\nHEYWARD: You are the traitor, Black Donald. You and your doctor friend here. Now you will be taken to Mullach Castle. To face Red Cap. To face your punishment.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: EXT. MULLACH CASTLE COURTYARD\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MACHINERY OFF. LARGE DOOR OPENS. MEN MARCH IN, OVER COBBLES/FLAGSTONES )\nDOCTOR: Alright, I can walk by myself you know.\nJAMIE: Get your hands off me!\nHEYWARD: You'd be well advised to hold your tongue, while you still have a head to keep it in.\nDOCTOR: Well where is he? I’m waiting. I’m a very busy man you know.\nJAMIE: That’s him!\nHEYWARD: Master Red Cap, these are the two men I was telling you about.\nJAMIE: (TERRIFIED) What in the name of—?\nRED: CAP (IMPOSSIBLY DEEP VOICE) This is one called Doctor?\nHEYWARD: It is.\nRED: CAP Red Cap will know why you are here.\nDOCTOR: You're right, Jamie. He is rather short.\nJAMIE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: And I suppose the oversize work boots, grey boiler suit and red hard hat are fine if you’re after the ‘oil worker on steroids’ look.\nRED: CAP What is blue box?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 42\nHEYWARD: Your lordship, he referred to it as the ‘TARDIS’.\nRED: CAP\nTAR: — DIS. What is its use?\nDOCTOR: It’s just a box.\nRED: CAP Doctor will open.\nDOCTOR: Doctor will not open. I can see what you’re doing here, taking on the guise of some bogeyman from Scottish legend to terrify the locals into doing your bidding. Well, it won’t work on me! Or on Donald, come to that. Isn’t that right, Donald?\nJAMIE: (SCARED WITLESS) A-aye! Doctor, are you sure about [this-?]\nRED: CAP\nDOCTOR: WILL OPEN BOX!\nDOCTOR: Doctor will not! Who are you really, and why do you want the oil?\nDOCTOR: You do realise you’re contaminating the timeline?\nRED: CAP I know nothing of timeline? Open box!\nDOCTOR: I will not! I can play this game for hours, you know.\nDOCTOR: Ugh! (GASPS, BADLY HURT)\nJAMIE: You touch him again and—!\nRED: CAP No speak! Hours you have, Doctor. Days you do not. Tomorrow you will open box. If box not open, Red Cap will have your blood.\nRED: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 43"

And even if he takes the key it won’t do him any good, the lock has an advanced meson recognition system.\nJAMIE: Sounds like witchcraft.\nDOCTOR: That depends on how you look at it.

I’m thinking the Cap will reward me handsomely for this night’s work.\nJAMIE: Damn your eyes. You’re a Highlander, Guthrie.\nGUTHRIE: And what has that ever brought me but hardship and hunger? I knew you'd try something, oh yes. I knew you’d be plotting to get out while the rest of us slept. The Donald I knew wouldn’t take fright at a few tales of ghosties, would he now?\nDOCTOR: (TO OTHERS) Maybe we’d better do as he says.\nGUTHRIE: Aye that’s it, Frenchie.\nJAMIE: I’m not taking orders from him.\nDOCTOR: He does have us at a disadvantage. Though admittedly there are three of us and only one of him.\nGUTHRIE: Hey, try anything and I’11 run you through.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think you’re hardly likely to kill me. Red Cap will never get into that blue box of mine, if I’m dead.\nGUTHRIE: That’s what you think, Frenchie. Me, I heard the Cap’s got someone coming to do the job.

Yes.\nJAMIE: Now then, Will Guthrie. I ought to cut you down where you stand, you dog.\nGUTHRIE: Please, Donald, I meant you no harm, honest I didn’t.

Now get you from my sight.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: Jamie, no! — Quickly, we must go.\nJAMIE: What? I couldn’t just kill the man in cold blood.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t expect you to.\nMRS: CYPRIEN But he’1ll raise the alarm.\nJAMIE: Ah, you’re right!\nDOCTOR: We should have brought him with us.\nJAMIE: Well why didn’t you say so-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Ssh!

Point is, we’re going to have to\nJAMIE: cross it.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR: Yes, and fast. Listen!\nMRS: CYPRIEN It’s Red Cap! Oh, mercy. There’s no escape now.\nDOCTOR: What about down the cliff?\nMRS: CYPRIEN I can’t get down there-!\nJAMIE: Are you mad-?\nDOCTOR: It’s less steep further round.\nMRS: CYPRIEN We won’t make it. Red Cap is too fast.\nDOCTOR: We don’t know unless we try. Come on.\nJAMIE: Look, just below the horizon. Sparks!\nMRS: CYPRIEN That’s him!\nDOCTOR: He’s fast, I’1ll give him that. And maybe that’1l work to our advantage.\nJAMIE: He’s gaining on us. — Doctor, he’s right on top of us!\nDOCTOR: Keep going. We’re almost there.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Agh! (GRABBED BY RED CAP. SCOOPED UP) Doctor-!\nDOCTOR: Mrs Cyprien! He took Mrs Cyprien!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 60\nMRS: CYPRIEN (DUMPED ON GROUND, TEN FEET AWAY) Ugh-!\nJAMIE: There, she’s over there! (THEY RUN)\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nDOCTOR: (APPR.) Mrs Cyprien! Dear lady, are you alright?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Yes, yes I think so. He just scooped me up in his grasp —\nJAMIE: Like a dolly, aye.\nRED: CAP (OFF) Nowhere is safe from me. — Go back!\nJAMIE: He’s trying to split us up. Pick us off one by one.\nDOCTOR: No, if he wanted us dead he’d have done it by now. He’s just toying with us until the Redcoats arrive. See over there?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: EXT. GRAVEL ROAD\nRILKE: Major Heyward, sir. Up ahead. Sparks!\nHEYWARD: Master Cap’s onto them. Spread the men out, Sergeant.\nRILKE: Can we not leave him to it, sir? I’ve a mind not to get too close to the Cap when his blood’s up.\nHEYWARD: Do your job, Rilke.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: EXT. EDGE OF GREAT MAW\nRED: CAP (OFF) Doctor cannot outrun Red Cap. Red Cap will have his blood!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Oh shut up! — (TO ALICE) Alice? Can you stand?\nMRS: CYPRIEN I’m fine, really.\nJAMIE: I say we hold our ground!\nDOCTOR: He'd go through us like a bowling ball. No, we go back the way we\nDOCTOR: came.\nJAMIE: But that’s what he wants!\nDOCTOR: Yes it is. Precisely. Come on.\nJAMTE: Now’s our chance to end him, once and for all —\nDOCTOR: Jamie no! A sword won’t be enough to —\nMRS: CYPRIEN He’1ll kill you!\nJAMIE: Ugh!\nRED: CAP (MOVING OFF) You are fools! Go back.\nDOCTOR: Jamie! Oh no. Jamie —\nMRS: CYPRIEN Is he dead?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Jamie? Come on old friend.\nJAMIE: Oh. I feel like I’ve been hit by a stag.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take your word for how that feels.\nRED: CAP (OFF) Blue box will open! Power will be Red Cap’s!\nDOCTOR: (CALLS OFF) Do your worst, you fraud. A few magic tricks with footwear don’t scare me.\nMRS: CYPRIEN We can’t go on like this. He’ll just drive us to exhaustion.\nDOCTOR: I have no intention of letting this go on.\nRED: CAP (OFF) Red Cap comes for Doctor next.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS) Is that all you’ve got? I’ve seen faster snails!\nJAMIE: (STANDS) Now you’re just making him angry!\nDOCTOR: That’s what I want. The angrier, the better. Come on, back to the quarry.\nJAMIE: We've just come from there!\nDOCTOR: Trust me, Jamie. Fast as we can. When I give the word, drop to the ground. Come on!\nRED: CAP (APPROACHING) Red Cap gains on Doctor. Doctor will be his!\nMRS: CYPRIEN He’s coming.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: Wait... Wait.\nJAMIE: The quarry! We have to stop.\nRED: CAP You are mine-!\nDOCTOR: Now! Get down on the ground!\nRED: CAP\nDOCTOR: (OVER THIS) .. but you are in mine! Give my regards to Old Harry, won’t you?\nJAMIE: (LAUGHS) Straight off the edge, will you look at that!\nMRS: CYPRIEN How did you know that would happen?\nDOCTOR: That’s the thing about being fast. You need to have good brakes. And he didn’t.\nJAMIE: So much for the oil baron, eh? More an oily stain.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Jamie.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHOUTS FROM HEYWARD’S APPROACHING POSSE, SOME HUNDRED FEET\nAWAY: )\nAWAY: But we’re not out of trouble yet.\nJAMIE: Major Heyward, aye. I’ve a score or two to settle with him.\nDOCTOR: Now is not the time, not against an entire company of Redcoats. There’s a path below, around the edge of the Maw. Jamie, I want you to take Mrs Cyprien away from here.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 65\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: But — what about you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: If we all go the soldiers will just come after us. This way,\nDOCTOR: have a chance. Besides, my TARDIS is back at the Castle.\nJAMIE: Aye, and that dungeon-!\nDOCTOR: I’1ll survive. Jamie, old friend — you have a life here. Live Live to fight another day.\nJAMIE: As you wish.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Doctor, you’ve been so kind, but I don’t know who you are.\nDOCTOR: A friend. Now go, quickly!\nDOCTOR: Be careful.\nJAMIE: (OFF) God speed, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good luck. — Now, out of the frying pan again.\nDOCTOR: you\nDOCTOR: ats\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: EXT. INSIDE THE GREAT MAW (CONTINUOUS)\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie, do you think he’1ll be alright? The Doctor-?\nJAMTE: He’s a resourceful man. A brave one, too. Hold on there, hen —\nMRS: CYPRIEN . Thank you. Have you known him long?\nJAMIE: Two days, but he says we’ve known each other longer. Some Lords took those memories, he says.\nMRS: CYPRIEN What do you think?\nJAMIE: I’m no great thinker, Mrs C.\nMRS: CYPRIEN It seems to me, the way you were together — kinship like that takes more than a day or two to develop.\nJAMIE: Aye. (BEAT) Aye, perhaps you’re right. C’mon —\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: EXT. EDGE OF GREAT MAW\nHEYWARD: (ON HORSEBACK) Stay right where you are, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Major Heyward. I was just taking the morning air.\nHEYWARD: I confess I’m surprised to see you still alive! Did you not meet with Master Cap?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes, he did... drop by!\nHEYWARD: Well, which way did he go?\nDOCTOR: Oh down, definitely down.\nHEYWARD: D-[own-?] (REALISATION) Good God! D’you mean-?\nDOCTOR: If the man, or whatever he was, can’t watch where he’s going then that’s hardly my fault, is it?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: EXT. INSIDE THE GREAT MAW\nJAMIE: Reach your foot down to the path, Mrs C. Don’t worry, I’ve got you —\nMRS: CYPRIEN (MOMENTARILY UNBALANCED) Oh-!\nJAMIE: . I’ve got you.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie-?\nJAMIE: Aye-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Your arm is.. around my waist.\nJAMIE: (DREAMY) It is, aye. (REALISES, EMBARRASSED) Sorry, well, er.. this way, hen.\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: I do appreciate your help. And I’m sure you were a great help to the Doctor. I know what it is to be alone, without friends, not knowing what the future holds.\nJAMIE: . like the Doctor is now. Damn and blast it!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie! There’s no call for that kind of language!\nJAMIE: Can you follow the path round yourself, Mrs C?\nMRS: CYPRIEN I think so. Why?\nJAMIE: I have to go back.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 69\nMRS: CYPRIEN To help the Doctor?\nJAMIE: I should never have left him. I should be standing by him.\nMRS: CYPRIEN I want to come with you.\nJAMIE: He won’t thank me for that. Besides I don’t think that...\nMRS: CYPRIEN What? That a “raggedy lassie” wouldn’t be much help? I got you out of the castle, didn’t I?\nJAMIE: Aye, that you did. Alright then, back up we go.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: EXT. EDGE OF GREAT MAW\nDOCTOR: I want to meet your “Overlord”, and I think he’1ll very much want to meet me.\nHEYWARD: (ON HORSEBACK) Oh, you’ll get your chance, Doctor. But it’s a long journey, and I mean to make it an uncomfortable one. Now — (FX: PISTOL COCKED) — where are your confederates?\nDOCTOR: Oh, them. We split up as soon as we left the castle. They went, ooh, that-away.\nHEYWARD: North? You’re lying. (CALLS OFF) Sergeant Rilke!\nRILKE: (APPR, OFF) Coming, sir!\nHEYWARD: Watch this man. If he tries to escape hurt him, hurt him very badly.\nRILKE: (ARRIVED) Yes, sir.\nHEYWARD: (MOVING OFF, CALLING OUT) The Highlander and the girl are still out here, around the edge of the Maw. You men follow the eastern side, I shall take the west!\nDOCTOR: Sergeant — Rilke, isn’t it? Are you proud to serve this Overlord of yours?\nRILKE: I’m just a soldier. I does what the Major says. Mind you — I’ve not heard of anyone volunteering to see the Overlord. And usually those that do see him ain’t ever seen again. (LAUGHS)\nDOCTOR: I’m sure his reputation is exaggerated.\nRILKE: Are ye now? No man’s ever seen his face. Not that there aren’t stories, mind —\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 71\nJAMIE: (BEHIND RILKE) He couldnae be more ugly than the innards you’1l see on the floor, not unless you drop the pistol-!\nDOCTOR: (DELIGHTED) Jamie! You came back!\nJAMIE: Aye, and Mrs C too. (CALLING BACK) You can come out now!\nMRS: CYPRIEN (CLAMBERING UP FROM EDGE OF MAW) Just — one moment...\nDOCTOR: Let me help —\nRILKE: Don’t move, Doctor. Or so help me, I’1ll —\nJAMIE: Did you no’ hear me proper, Sergeant? Drop that pistol, or I’1l run you through.\nRILKE: Rather be dead than be sent to the Overlord for letting you go. No, you’ll be the one dropping the sword.\nHEYWARD: (VERY DISTANT) There they are-!\nDOCTOR: Too late, the Major’s seen us. Jamie, just.. do as he says.\nRILKE: Well, ‘Black Donald’-? What d’you say-?\nJAMIE: (TO RILKE) You have one shot. Your bullet may well miss, but my blade will still find your heart.\nMRS: CYPRIEN (FORBIDDING) Jamie. No.\nJAMIE: Och, what’s the use-?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 72\nMRS: CYPRIEN Sorry, Doctor. We tried.\nDOCTOR: A very courageous effort, I’m sure. But I didn’t ask to be ‘rescued’!\nJAMIE: Och, I’m sorry we bothered. And you say we got into some dangerous situations, in the past-? Well, I’m surprised we ever got out of them.\nDOCTOR: Jamie — trust me.\nJAMIE: Trust you! I trust you’1ll get me killed before all this is over.\nDOCTOR: Trust me, and with luck you’1l have a free Scotland again.\nJAMIE: Oh aye, and all the oatcakes I can eat, no doubt.\nHEYWARD: (ON HORSEBACK, TO STOP) Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: Major.\nHEYWARD: What’s this? The fearsome ‘Black Donald’, a helpless prisoner. No more oatcakes for you, Highlander. Oh, and the lovely Mrs Cyprien. You’1ll be joining us on our journey, too.\nDOCTOR: To Edinburgh, I presume-?\nHEYWARD: Edinburgh? That dung heap?\nDOCTOR: I thought we were going to meet your Overlord?\nHEYWARD: Oh I’m taking you to the Overlord, alright. We’ll be taking a convoy — to Grangemouth!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 73\nJAMIE: (SOTTO) Grangemouth-?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Of course, the oil refinery. Not that it’s supposed to be there, not for another two hundred years-!\nHEYWARD: Sergeant — get ‘em in the carts!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: EXT. GREAT SOUTHERN ROAD (ON CART, IN MOTION)\nRILKE: (OFF) Get along there! Wagons ho!\nJAMIE: Are you alright there, Mrs C?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Yes, it’s just... I’ve been away so long. What has happened to Edinburgh? To my husband?\nJAMIE: Husband-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN I just... I just don’t know what to think.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of everything soon. At least we're heading in the right direction.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Yes, the cart-loads of barrels make that very clear.\nJAMIE: They call it “the road of blood”.\nDOCTOR: The main route for the convoys in and out of Grangemouth. So many carts. So much oil —\nJAMIE: Black water! Damn the stuff! What does the Overlord use it all for, I’d like to know?\nMRS: CYPRIEN I’ve no idea.\nDOCTOR: Does everything that comes out of Red Cap’s wells go to the same\nDOCTOR: place?\nJAMIE: I don’t know. But it’s not just that one place Doctor, look around you.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: Good grief. It’s like Texas! Pumpjacks! As far as the eye can see. And over there, see, those look like factories.\nJAMIE: What’s that, then?\nDOCTOR: A place where things are made. The stone and iron that came out of the Great Maw, it all has to be refined, processed.\nJAMIE: (NOT COMPREHENDING) Oh, aye.\nDOCTOR: It’s the Clearances all over again — only this time for industry, not agriculture. There’s a dark hand at work here, Jamie, one that cares nothing for human suffering... or history, come to that. How’s he done it? All this? It’s too much for one man, he’d have needed allies. Associates.\nJAMIE: Collaborators, aye.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Don’t say that-!\nDOCTOR: Mrs Cyprien?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Don’t... say that word. Please.\nDOCTOR: Is something wrong? Alice?\nMRS: CYPRIEN He was made to do it, I promise you. He’s not a bad man, I know he isn’t! But you’1ll think bad of him and he doesn’t deserve it.\nJAMIE: Who the devil d’you mean, woman?\nMRS: CYPRIEN My husband. Victor, Victor Cyprien. He’s an engineer, he...\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, tell us in your own time.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 76\nMRS: CYPRIEN One day the Overlord came for Victor. I didn’t see him for myself, but...\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: . I heard him from outside the door, heard that terrible rasping voice. He asked Victor to work for him, constructing mechanisms from his designs.\nDOCTOR: What sort of designs-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Machines for digging, drilling, building, far outside the human scale. Amazing things. Terrible things.\nJAMIE: And he agreed-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: Victor refused. These things were against nature, he said. They argued. Later, Victor told me that the Overlord had threatened him, saying he’d see to it that Victor did as he’d asked.\nJAMIE: How?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it obvious? (TO MRS C) He kidnapped you, didn’t he?\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: Yes. I was walking along the street in Edinburgh when the Redcoats took me. I was put into a carriage and brought to the castle, where I found you. I don’t know if Victor even knows I’m alive.\nDOCTOR: He must do, if he thought you were dead... the Overlord would have no power over him. Mrs Cyprien.. Alice.. these derricks and pumpjacks may be vile, but they should also give you hope. They are a very clear sign of your husband’s love for you.\nJAMIE: I suppose they are at that.\nMRS: CYPRIEN I hadn’t thought of them that way.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: Well I suggest you do, because you’re on your way back to him and...\nDOCTOR: Get down, both of you-!\nJAMIE: An ambush!\nRILKE: (OFF) Get under cover! Under cover and mark your targets!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Ambush-? By who-?\nJAMIE: Highlanders, I reckon. We’re still in my territory. (CALLING OFF) Over here! Hold your fire-!\nJAMIE: Hey, what d’you think you’re playing at-?\nDOCTOR: They’re Highlanders all right, but they can’t identify us ata distance.\nJAMIE: You’re right. Let’s get under the cart.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: EXT. GREAT SOUTHERN ROAD — UNDER CART (CONTINUOUS)\nRILKE: (OFF) Hold the line, lads! Keep firing!\nRILKE: (FX: MUSKET BALLS IMPACT ON WOOD. OFF, BATTLE REIGNS. MUSKET FIRE, SWORD ON SHIELD, HORSES, ETC)\nDOCTOR: That’s better. — Can you see who it is yet?\nJAMIE: See there, that’s the Buchanan tartan, there the MacNaughton. Fighting together, jings man, that’s a heart-warming sight.\nDOCTOR: What’s that-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN (ALARMED) They’re coming towards us-!\nJAMIE: Well will you look at that? That’s a shellycoat!\nDOCTOR: A shellycoat? I thought they were a legend.\nMRS: CYPRIEN It looks real enough to me.\nJAMIE: Aye, a river bogey who wears a coat of shells.\nDOCTOR: Well, a man dressed up to look like one, at least. (THOUGHFULLY ) Like Red Cap — dressed to impress? And I have to say, it works!\nJAMIE: I mean what I say Doctor. They’re true Scots folk.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Look! He’s wounded. Oh Doctor, can’t we do something?\nDOCTOR: Stay here.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 79\nJAMIE: Doctor no, you’ll.. Ach.. that man has a death wish.\nHEYWARD: (OFF, IN BACKGROUND) Bring the carts round! Form a defensive circle!\nSHELLYCOAT: (COARSE, THROATY) Ah, touch me you devil and I’11 take you with me, so I will!\nDOCTOR: Easy, easy, I’m a friend.\nSHELLYCOAT: Are you a Scotsman?\nDOCTOR: Honorary, I hope. Now let’s get you under cover.\nSHELLYCOAT: Agh, the Redcoats’ve finished me. Finished all of my kind.\nDOCTOR: Your kind? You mean the Scots?\nSHELLYCOAT: The blood, the essence, the wellspring of all things is being drained. All we are... all we become... He’11 kill us. Kill us all...\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. GREAT SOUTHERN ROAD (ELSEWHERE)\nRILKE: (APPROACHING) Sir, they’re picking us off, permission to withdraw.\nHEYWARD: Hold them, man, hold them! They’re after the black water, trying to disrupt supplies. This is the fifth attack this month, so it’s time we taught them a lesson.\nRILKE: Maybe they heard the Cap’s gone sir?\nHEYWARD: Hardly, it’s not as if there aren’t more where he... wait a minute, of course!\nRILKE: Sir?\nHEYWARD: The prisoners. Bring three men and follow me. Double time, Sergeant!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: EXT. GREAT SOUTHERN ROAD — UNDER CART\nJAMIE: Doctor! Is yon shellycoat dead?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. Poor devil —\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nDOCTOR: We’re rather caught between a rock and a hard place here.\nJAMIE: Aye, I’m not used to being shot at by my own side, I have to say.\nMRS: CYPRIEN But only the Redcoats can take us to the Overlord.\nDOCTOR: Quite a dilemma.\nJAMIE: Seems to me as though the Highlanders have the upper hand. You see there, they’re breaking the English lines. I say we make a run for it. Head for the burn there.\nDOCTOR: Jamie, none of us is bulletproof!\nRILKE: (APPROACHING) You three. Stand!\nHEYWARD: (APPROACHING) You heard the Sergeant!\nJAMIE: Oh, what’s he want now-?\nHEYWARD: Black Donald, these are your men, yes?\nJAMIE: Well, they’re Highlanders.\nHEYWARD: Then tell them to lay down their arms.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 82\nJAMIE: I will not.\nHEYWARD: Sergeant — kill the girl.\nRILKE: (FX: COCKING PISTOL) Sir-!\nDOCTOR: Er, I don’t think you should do that.\nHEYWARD: I didn’t ask for your opinion, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, but I’m giving it to you all the same. Not only is Mrs Cyprien an innocent in all this, but I don’t believe you realise how important to the Overlord she is.\nHEYWARD: Stand down, Sergeant.\nRILKE: (SULKY) Sir.\nMRS: CYPRIEN (SOTTO) Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Don’t thank me yet.\nHEYWARD: Alright, Sergeant, form a firing squad.\nRILKE: Be my pleasure, sir. (ASIDE) Squad — assemble!\nDOCTOR: I don’t like the way this is going.\nMRS: CYPRIEN No, neither do I.\nRILKE: Present — arms!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 83\nHEYWARD: Donald, tell your men to lay down their arms, or I’1l send them your body. That should take the fight out of them.\nDOCTOR: Now just a minute, Major.\nHEYWARD: Silence!\nJAMIE: It’s alright, Doctor. I decided long ago that I was ready to die for Scotland.\nDOCTOR: The Overlord will want to see both of us, Heyward. Don’t you realise that?\nHEYWARD: You? Some Frenchman of no account?\nDOCTOR: Just as Red Cap served the Overlord, Black Donald serves me. He is my lieutenant, and those Highlanders out there are my rescue party. I’m extremely important to them.\nHEYWARD: I always knew there was more to you than met the eye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nJAMIE: Oh, Doctor, what have you done now-?\nHEYWARD: Alright Sergeant, you heard him. Shoot the pair of them.\nMRS: CYPRIEN No! You mustn’t!\nRILKE: Ready —\nJAMIE: Full of good ideas, aren’t you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 84\nRILKE: . Aim —\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Jamie. I meant to make us more of a prize, alive!\nRILKE: Fire-!\nRILKE: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 85"

Come down from your perch, and meet me face to face — if you’re man enough!\nJAMIE: You! I might have known!

C’moan then, I’ve got plenty for the likes o’ you —\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING OUT FROM BEHIND CART) Might I just interject, before you two gentlemen butt heads?\nJAMIE: Stay back, Doctor, this is clan business-!\nDOCTOR: All the same. Please.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 88\nROB: ROY What’s this creature of yours, Donald? Looks like some Yankee doodle.\nDOCTOR: I suppose it makes a change from ‘Frenchie’. I am the Doctor. The lady hiding behind the cart is Mrs Alice Cyprien —\nMRS: CYPRIEN (OFF, NERVOUS) H-hello-?\nDOCTOR: . and Donald here, it seems you know. We’re all late of the Red Cap’s hospitality. Now, whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?\nROB: ROY Which Red Cap?\nDOCTOR: There’s more than one?\nJAMIE: Him at Mullach Castle. And my Doctor bested him in battle, so best not to trifle with us — Rob Roy MacGregor!\nDOCTOR: What-?\nROB: ROY I’d heard the Cap at Mullach had been brought down, [but —]\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, did he say [‘Rob Roy MacGregor’? ]\nJAMIE: Aye, Rob Roy MacGregor, of the clan MacGregor.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS) You’re Rob Roy-?\nROB: ROY Aye, and I’11 thank you not to laugh in my face, Yankee!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. What with fake mythic monsters, pretend spooks, now someone claiming to be a man who’s been dead for forty years? I mean, honestly — (GRABBED BY THROAT)\nROB: ROY (HOLDING DOCTOR) I am who I say I am. Who in Satan’s name are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 89\nJAMIE: Put him down, Rob. It’s like I say: he’s the fellow that bested the Cap.\nROB: ROY Then — (LETS DOCTOR GO)\nDOCTOR: (GASPS) Thank you —\nROB: ROY . you're a friend of Scotland, and a friend of Scotland is a friend of mine.\nJAMIE: Well said, Rob Roy MacGregor. Aye, and thank you for rescuin’ us when you did.\nDOCTOR: Not that we needed rescuing, of course —\nROB: ROY I didn’t rescue your useless hide, Donald. It was the convoy we wanted.\nJAMIE: How d’you mean-?\nROB: ROY We’re stopping as many aS we can, pouring the black water back onto the land. (CALLS OFF) C’moan, boys!\nHIGHLANDERS: Aye!!!\nHIGHLANDERS: (FX: HIGHLANDERS RUSH FORWARD. MONTAGE: BARRELS ROLLING, AXES\nAGAINST: WOOD, LIQUID GUSHING, HIGHLANDERS CHEERING.

GREAT SOUTHERN ROAD (NIGHT\nJAMIE: (APPR) Hey there, Mrs C. You cold-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Half-frozen, yes. Despite the fire.\nJAMIE: (SITTING) Here, I got ye a Redcoat’s red coat. Never mind the blood, it won’t show once it’s dried.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Thank you, but I’1ll manage.\nJAMIE: Suit yerself.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Where’s the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Are you always so obstreperous, or do you just not comprehend-?\nJAMIE: Over yonder, rowing with Rob. Best leave them to it.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) .. We need to go where the convoy was going.\nROB: ROY (WALKING) Aye, you said. But only a madman would willingly enter the city of spires!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Grangemouth?\nROB: ROY\nROB: (WALKING) That’s what some call it. Between what was Glasgow and Edinburgh, the Overlord has built himself a city. A city as tall aS a mountain and as gleaming as a bag of snakes.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Well, we want to go there!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 91\nROB: ROY\nROB: (STOPPED) I told you, you cannae go there. The Overlord knows there’s a rebellion coming. He has the city gates guarded tighter than an army drum.\nDOCTOR: But he lets these convoys through?\nROB: ROY A steady stream, all day and all night.\nDOCTOR: Then that’s how we get in!\nJAMIE: (APPR) I don’t know if I’m of a mind to get arrested all over again.\nMRS: CYPRIEN (APPR) No, no — the Doctor’s right!\nDOCTOR: Listen. We have carts here, don’t we? If you lend us some men, Rob, we can drive this convoy right into the city.\nROB: ROY And why in the Saints’ names would I do that? Stay here, help us stop the convoys and we’1l bleed the Overlord out!\nMRS: CYPRIEN But I have to get into the city. I have to find Victor-!\nJAMIE: See here, hen — every convoy has a military escort. And we don’t!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Could we not take the coats off the poor souls you’ve killed here? Like the one you offered me-?\nJAMIE: Aye, that could work. I’m not wearing no Redcoat, mind. I’d sooner hang.\nDOCTOR: We’ll have to move fast. Heyward has already stolen a march on us.\nROB: ROY Did you not hear me? We stay here, we fight here, this is where we can cause the Overlord the most pain.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: No, it isn’t! Look, Rob Roy was — I mean, is — a great leader of men. Scotland’s own Robin Hood. You of all people should see the wisdom of going into the enemy’s camp.\nROB: ROY Aye...\nDOCTOR: Think about it, a few men can do far more damage there than here. Sabotage the machines, raise a rebellion.\nJAMIE: Strike at the heart of the Overlord’s power.\nDOCTOR: It could be the turning point you’ve been looking for.\nROB: ROY (MOVING OFF) Come on then, Donald, let’s get those uniforms collected.\nJAMIE: (MOVING OFF) And make these carts into something like a proper convoy.\nMRS: CYPRIEN A fine speech, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It was rather, wasn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: EXT. GRANGEMOUTH APPROACH (ON CARTS)\nROB: ROY (OFF) Keep those carts moving, lads.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Doctor, I feel I must confide in you. I’m worried about Victor.\nDOCTOR: You’re on your way to see him. There’s no need to worry.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Rob Roy may not understand, he was forced to do what he did. I don’t want any harm to come to him.\nDOCTOR: And none shall. That I promise you.\nJAMIE: Doctor, do you see that?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Oh! Is that Grangemouth?\nDOCTOR: (IN AWE, ALMOST TO HIMSELF) The City of Spires. More like a future, nightmare vision of New York!\nJAMIE: (CALLING UP) Hey there, Rob. What’s with the delay-?\nROB: ROY\nROB: (APPROACHING) A communication from further along the road: seems as the Redcoats are seeking a French dandy, travelling with Black Donald and a young woman.\nDOCTOR: I presume, therefore, Major Heyward made it back safely.\nJAMIE: He must have marched like Red Cap himself. So what now?\nROB: ROY Turn back of course! There’s nothing more to be done.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR: You’re never going to clear the English from Scotland with that attitude.\nROB: ROY There’s only so much I’11 take from your tongue, [you dandified—]\nDOCTOR: The first casualty of war is the plan. We have to adapt, that’s all. These empty barrels we’re carrying —\nROB: ROY What about them-?\nJAMIE: (REALISES DOCTOR’S PLAN) Oh, you cannae be serious!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Jamie, but you and Mrs Cyprien are going to have to travel inside these barrels.\nJAMIE: We’ll never fit in those! Well, Mrs C, maybe...\nMRS: CYPRIEN I’1l do whatever’s necessary, to get inside the city.\nDOCTOR: It won’t be for long.\nJAMIE: It had better not be.\nDOCTOR: I promise. Now, (FX: DONNING RED COAT) .. if I can just borrow this red coat —\nJAMIE: So what are you going to do, while we’re in yon barrels?\nDOCTOR: An act of dissembling. Cap at a jaunty angle, and... How do I look?\nJAMIE: Like a Frenchman!\nROB: ROY Into the barrels, then. Quickly!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: EXT. GRANGEMOUTH CHECKPOINT (ON CART)\nJAMIE: (MUFFLED) Can’t you go any faster? It’s hard to breathe!\nDOCTOR: (DRIVING CART) I’m doing my best. I don’t think these horses like me —\nJAMIE: (MUFFLED) I cannae imagine why.\nSENTRY: (OFF) Halt! Halt there, I say!\nDOCTOR: Quiet now, we’re approaching the checkpoint. Rob —\nROB: ROY (BESIDE HIM) Aye-?\nDOCTOR: Head down, and I’1l1 do the talking. (RUSTIC NORFOLK FROM HERE) Woah there-!\nSENTRY: (APPR) State your business, soldier!\nDOCTOR: This be a convoy for the Overlord, what you stopping us for?\nSENTRY: There’s no convoy due til dawn.\nDOCTOR: Well, we’re ‘ere.\nSENTRY: I can’t let you in, you’re not on my list! I can’t let you in if you’re not on my list.\nDOCTOR: Lad, we’re not on your list, because... well, we... (INSPIRATION) we’re dead!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 96\nSENTRY: Wh-what ?\nDOCTOR: Recognise the tunic? We’re all that’s left of the 78 Foot. Major Heyward’s men-?\nSENTRY: Then — you are dead!\nDOCTOR: Ah, but we’re born again as heroes, lad. Attacked by hundreds of hairy Highlanders, we were. Rob Roy himself reared up in front of the Major —\nROB: ROY (BAD ENGLISH ACCENT) .. eight foot tall, he was.\nDOCTOR: You be quiet, I’m tellin’ it. I yelled, ‘Major, run for your life.’ And so he did, all the way to Grangemouth.\nENSIGN: Then what?\nDOCTOR: Then lad, Black Donald himself appeared. Hair in thistles, murder in his wild eyes!\nDOCTOR: Killed half us rearguard with his bare hands. Still — here we are, with the last of the Mullach water. Now, lad — you go find the Major, and you explain to him why the platoon that saved his very neck, is left waiting in a Scottish fog on a sentry’s pleasure?\nSENTRY: (CALLS) Let them pass!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, TO ROB. NO ACCENT) Eight foot tall — hmph!\nROB: ROY (SOTTO) I got my reputation to consider.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 97\nROB: ROY What an awful place this is!\nDOCTOR: An industrial compound the size of a minor metropolis. Oh, but this is appalling. Let alone the consequences for the environment, damage to the timeline on such a scale — well, it’s unprecedented!\nROB: ROY I went to what remains of Fort William once, and that was bad enough. But this, this is how I imagined hell to look.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Dark satanic mills, for sure...\nROB: ROY We’re far enough now, pull over.\nROB: ROY C’mon, lads. Let’s get these barrels over —\nDOCTOR: Rob, you see to Mrs Cyprien.\nDOCTOR: Jamie?\nJAMIE: (GROGGY) Hair like thistles, have I?\nDOCTOR: I was busking it. How are you doing, Mrs Cyprien-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN (SHORT OF BREATH) I will — survive. Are we in-?\nJAMTE: We are, aye.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 98\nMRS: CYPRIEN It was worth it, then. We must get to Victor.\nROB: ROY Doctor, we shouldn’t linger here.\nJAMIE: Have to say, the Rob’s right.\nROB: ROY And there’s sure to be word sent to Heyward. The streets’1l be crawling with Redcoats like lice on a beggar.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nROB: ROY So it’s here we go our separate ways.\nDOCTOR: Surely it’s better if we stay together. Strength in numbers?\nROB: ROY I came to raise rebellion, so I’m away to see what favour me and Donald have here. Will you join me, Donald?\nJAMIE: Later, Rob. I must see the Doctor and Mrs C safe first. We’ve come this far together, we shouldn’t part now.\nDOCTOR: Good man.\nROB: ROY Aye, well, I’ve three good lads with me. I’1ll go my own way. But if you have need of me, send word, I’1ll come if I can.\nJAMIE: Good luck.\nROB: ROY And with you. — (OFF) Come lads.

It’s bread I need. Bread — or cheese, perhaps?\nMRS: CYPRIEN We have nothing, I’m afraid.\nBLIND: BEGGAR Then you wants to find some. Cheese brings rats, lassie. And rats is good eating.\nJAMIE: Uuurgh-!\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING OVER) We’ll be sure to remember that. But, before you go — please. Victor Cyprien. He’s an important man.\nMRS: CYPRIEN A Frenchman.\nJAMIE: A Frenchman-?\nDOCTOR: Bien sur —\nBLIND: BEGGAR (AGITATED) What — not the Frenchman?\nDOCTOR: Possibly —\nBLIND: BEGGAR You don’t want him!

Mind, you’re lucky to be alive.\nDOCTOR: I've suffered worse.\nJAMIE: Well look, now you’re on the mend, Victor and I can go after Alice.

Your own wife! Why would you not go to help her? Speak to him Doctor, before I crown him.\nVICTOR: What is my wife to you, eh? This is my affair I think!\nDOCTOR: We went through rather a lot with her Victor. She saved our lives. That’s why Jamie — why we, feel strongly about her. Isn’t that right, Jamie?\nJAMIE: Aye.\nDOCTOR: And... She told us what happened. That the Overlord came to you, asked you to work on his designs.\nVICTOR: Those monstrous machines! I am a mining engineer, by trade. I have seen valleys turned to dust by cyanide, mountains collapse through undercutting. But these goliaths — nothing I had imagined could match them.\nJAMTE: Aye, well, we’ve seen them with our own eyes.\nDOCTOR: And when you wouldn’t help him, he took her.\nVICTOR: So it seems.\nJAMIE: Not that Victor here seems to have been too much troubled by it.\nVICTOR: You dirty Scots pig-!\nDOCTOR: Jamie! We’re guests in Victor’s house!\nJAMIE: Aye, aye! (A BEAT) I spoke out of turn.\nDOCTOR: I wonder if I could have some water? I heal quickly but it does tend to take a lot out of me.\nVICTOR: Yes, of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 114\nJAMIE: Tad: get aes\nDOCTOR: I’m sure Victor wouldn’t mind getting [it for —]\nJAMIE: You talk. I’1l1 go!\nVICTOR: The kitchen is to your right.\nJAMIE: edd fang) te\nDOCTOR: So, when Mrs Cyprien was kidnapped, you were forced to help the Overlord.\nVICTOR: Kidnapped! No Doctor, I thought my wife was dead.\nDOCTOR: But then — why did you help him?\nVICTOR: The Overlord is persuasive in many ways. Not least is his vision. He claims great benefits for mankind. To be a part of something so bold, so grand, for an engineer it was so, SO...\nDOCTOR: Seductive?\nVICTOR: Yes! I was an ambitious man, Doctor. I wanted to do great things. The Overlord offered me a magnificent opportunity.\nDOCTOR: At what cost?\nVICTOR: I thought my wife was dead!\nDOCTOR: I meant, to your humanity. I’ve seen what the Overlord has done with the tools you’ve built him and let me tell you Victor, it’s not pretty!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 115\nVICTOR: He is building a better world. You can’t do that without first removing some... dead wood.\nDOCTOR: Well, Victor Cyprien, it seems you’re not the man your wife talked to us about — warmly, fondly and with longing. What happened, Victor?\nVICTOR: Choices, Doctor. I made choices. You are right, the machines I built are used for... questionable things, perhaps. Some of that rubs off on you, I think. So no, I am not the same man. Not any more.\nDOCTOR: The Overlord’s lied to you Victor, about your wife, and his intentions. Do you even know who he is? Where he’s from, even?\nVICTOR: Non, I have never seen his face. He is always wrapped in scarves and a long carriage coat.\nDOCTOR: The black water, do you know what he intends to use it for?\nVICTOR: I’m not a confidant to all his plans. I built the derricks for him, I helped construct his skyscrapers, his citywide monorail, but the purpose is as much a mystery to me as it is to you.\nDOCTOR: Skyscrapers? Monorail? What year is it?\nVICTOR: Well, it’s 1884. Why?\nDOCTOR: Because it’s 1780 in the Highlands, where they’re still suffering the Clearances.\nVICTOR: I do not understand —\nDOCTOR: Neither do I, and that troubles me. Victor, you’re a man of science, of logic. So am I. So what I’m about to say is no flight of fancy. I believe the Overlord to be a creature from another world, another time, maybe even another dimension. A creature come to exploit this world by draining its oil.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 116\nVICTOR: Petroleum oil? But why? What use would that be to him?\nDOCTOR: In this planet’s future, it’1ll become very important indeed. There’s no reason why that shouldn’t be the case elsewhere. What we have here is a commodities broker, two hundred years before the fact!\nVICTOR: These things of which you speak seem fantastic, and yet —\nDOCTOR: . and yet deep down, you suspect they may be true. Help me stop him, Victor. Please. There’s still time to make the right choices!\nVICTOR: No. It is too late.\nDOCTOR: A man can change, Victor. I believe in you. Most importantly, Alice believes in you —\nHEYWARD: (OFF) Open up, Cyprien!\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that — Major Heyward!?!\nVICTOR: It is too late for me to change, Doctor. As soon as you arrived, I alerted the Overlord.\nDOCTOR: How-?\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nVICTOR: It is called a “telly-phone”, Doctor. A device supplied by the Overlord. Excuse me — (INTO PHONE) Hello-? (BEAT) It is for you,\nVICTOR: Doctor. You place your ear adjacent to the upper part [of the—]\nDOCTOR: (FX: TAKING PHONE) I’m familiar with its operation.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 117\nVICTOR: Now, I must admit Major Heyward. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR: (INTO PHONE) Hello-? Whom do I have the dubious pleasure of addressing?\nDOCTOR: Please don’t tell me it’s going to be one of those sort of calls\nOVERLORD: (CUTTING IN, SIBILANT, HORRIBLE) (D) You have cost us a great deal, “Doctor”.\nDOCTOR: Not as much as you’ve cost this timeline, “Overlord”. But I mean to see you settle the bill.\nOVERLORD: (D) We... look forward to.. our imminent encounter.\nDOCTOR: Our first and final encounter, I think you’1l find.\nDOCTOR: (FX: REPLACES RECEIVER) T. T. F. N.\nHEYWARD: (APPROACHING, BEHIND) Well, well — we meet again, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Major Heyward. False bonhomie I can live with, but please, spare me that cliché.\nVICTOR: (RUSHING IN) Major — I am afraid, the Highlander is nowhere to be found!\nHEYWARD: Where’s he gone, Doctor? Your associate?\nDOCTOR: He went to the kitchen a few minutes back.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 118\nVICTOR: Well, he is not there now! Where has he gone?\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, Victor. I think you can guess.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. THE TRANSFORMAT\nJAMIE: (WINCING AT STEAM) (SOTTO, TO HIMSELF) Well, if this isnae Old Harry's kitchen, it’s his bathtub for sure —\nMRS: CYPRIEN (FAR OFF) Help me. Please, somebody help me-!\nJAMIE: Mrs C! (CALLING AFTER) It’s alright, hen — help’s coming!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie? Is that you-? Jamie!!!\nJAMIE: (APPROACHING, THROUGH STEAM) I’m coming, I’m coming... Hey, now, what’ve they done to you here?\nMRS: CYPRIEN They brought me in, tied me to this — table, or whatever it is. Then they just left me here, I don’t know why.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, I didn’t see anyone on the way in. No guards, or sentries. Funny, that. (TRYING TO CUT TIES WITH DIRK — THE TIES\nARE: PLASTIC) Hold still a while, I’m taking my dirk to these ties\nMRS: CYPRIEN Amusing? How?\nJAMIE: Almost like — there’s no guards, because no-one’d ever want to break in here. What was it Victor called it-? ‘Tra’-? ‘Trans-‘?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Victor? You found Victor-?\nJAMTE: (DODGING SUBJECT) “Transformat”, that was it. Hey, I cannae tell what these ties of yours are made from, but it isnae rope, that’s for sure.\nMRS: CYPRIEN What about Victor-?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 120\nJAMIE: We found him, aye. I’m sorry, hen.\nMRS: CYPRIEN He didn’t believe you-?\nJAMIE: Oh, he believed us alright, it’s just...\nMRS: CYPRIEN He... (CAN’T BEAR TO SAY IT) He... didn’t care.\nJAMIE: It’s not for me to stand in judgement on a man, but it seems to me your husband is as cold-hearted a blackguard as ever crossed the English border. Och, damn these ties-!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Did you hear that-?\nJAMTE: Hear what, hen-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN It sounded [like —] (FX: SPARKS AGAIN) Over there!\nJAMIE: Och, no!\nRED: CAP (APPROACHING) What is it you do here-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN A Cap! A Red Cap!\nJAMIE: Aye, Rob said there was more than the one. Get back, Red Cap, or I’1ll —\nRED: CAP You stab Red Cap? With baby dagger? (LAUGHS)\nRED: (FX: JOINED BY ANOTHER RED CAP LAUGH. AND ANOTHER. ALL\nAPPROACHING: )\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie, run! There’s three of them!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 121\nJAMIE: I’1ll not desert you, Alice! Not like that no-good husband of yours!\nRED: CAP (TO OTHERS) Hold him —\nJAMIE: (GRABBED) Gaah!\nRED: CAP (STUDYING JAMIE) He is old.\nRED: CAP #2 Yet he has strength.\nRED: CAP He is suited.\nJAMIE: (STRUGGLING) Suited for what-?\nRED: CAP Capping. (TO OTHERS) Set him on table.\nJAMIE: Capping-? (REALISATION) Och, no —\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: Jamie, don’t you see? This is where they make them! This is where they make the Red Caps!\nJAMTE: Gah, these ties! I cannae move!\nRED: CAP Transformation begins now.\nRED: CAP #2 Look up. Cap comes down. Needle in cap punctures cranium.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Oh, mercy-!\nJAMIE: What’s that, in yon pipes? Black water again-?\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 122\nRED: CAP When cap is fitted, we make connection. Pump black water into your brain. To facilitate capping process.\nRED: CAP #2 You will be different. Be like Red Cap. Serve Overlord.\nRED: CAP Begin.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Jamie, I don’t want to die-!\nJAMIE: I’d hoped that when it came to my time, I’d go with a claymore in one hand and a jar of whiskey in the other, not with black water in my brains.\nJAMIE: (FX: WHIRRING — 2 x DRILLS ABOVE JAMIE & MRS C’S HEADS.

You should thank us for it.\nVICTOR: Thank you-?!?\nOVERLORD: We removed a distraction. Gave you motivation. Enabled you to fulfil your potential. You are a great man, Victor.\nVICTOR: But... I.. I despise myself!\nOVERLORD: Success has a price. We have decided: you may have her again.

Interesting. Describe to us his temperament.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, is this some kind of — staff assessment? ‘How is my villainy’?\nOVERLORD: The Hirudin Corporation is a listening corporation.

This Doctor alleges the rebels are gaining in number?\nHEYWARD: Their number is irrelevant. The clans of Scotland are too riven by internecine conflict to ever form an effective coalition.\nDOCTOR: Well, I saw two of its most feared leaders form an effective coalition today: Black Donald and Rob Roy MacGregor.\nOVERLORD: Is this true-?\nHEYWARD: Sir, “Black Donald” is now mucking out at the filtration plant, and this “MacGregor” — well, he is nothing more than one of the\nHEYWARD: midges in the Scottish heather: a bothersome pest whose bite is of no consequence!\nDOCTOR: I’d not be so quick to write off Rob myself —\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT.

The Hirudin Corporation, you said-?\nOVERLORD: That is what — I — represent.\nDOCTOR: I was just considering what sort of species would seek to suck the mineral blood of worlds, and then I [thought-]\nHEYWARD: Mineral blood-?\nDOCTOR: Keep up, Heyward. The black water, from the derricks-?\nOVERLORD: A much prized resource!\nDOCTOR: . AS I was saying, I’d never heard of a Hirudin Consortium. But I have heard of the hirudinea — the genus otherwise known as... the bloodsucking leech!\nOVERLORD: You.. are a well-read individual, Doctor!\nHEYWARD: Egad! He’s — he’s —\nDOCTOR: An entire colony of alien leeches, swarming all over the body of some poor, human host! I’d assumed the habit of speaking in the third person was some megalomaniacal affectation. But it’s not — is it, “Overlord”?\nOVERLORD: We — are — a division of — the Hirudin Corporation!\nDOCTOR: Corporation indeed! Look at it, Major — just look at it! They are your Overlord-! Leeching off the body of Scotland for some common commodity!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 135\nOVERLORD: There is profit in misery and there is much misery to come.\nHEYWARD: It’s monstrous.

Even if it as an expression of your loathing for me.\nMRS: CYPRIEN\nMRS: Things have changed, Victor. I did not recognise most of the country I travelled through. What has happened to Edinburgh, to our home?\nVICTOR: It is a ghost town. Everyone was moved here. Glasgow too, Stirling, every town for miles.\nMRS: CYPRIEN All this, to maintain your machines? All this, for the black water?\nVICTOR: I had no purpose. Without you. The machines became my purpose, do you [see—?] (FX: MRS C MOVES AWAY) Where are you going-?

I met with him.\nMRS: CYPRIEN He is enslaved in the... filtration unit, is that right? You may guide me in its direction.\nVICTOR: It is the main plant in Sector F, to the West.

Or, worse, one of the so- called “heroes” who have sabotaged many of our corporate divisions in the past.\nDOCTOR: Heroes-—?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) . but since it is clear you are neither of these, rather some freelance itinerant: Red Caps —\nRED: CAPS x 2 Overlord command-?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) . tear this “Doctor” limb from limb.\nRED: CAPS x 2 (ADVANCING ON DOCTOR) Like Overlord says.\nJAMTE: No, wait —\nMRS: CYPRIEN (GRABBED BY RILKE) Get off me!\nRILKE: Obstruct them, Highlander, and I’11 run the woman through-1\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: (GRABBED BY RED CAPS) Aaah-!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) That’s right, one limb each. Pull. Pull-!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Please, stop-!\nJAMTE: Just — don’t look, lassie. It’s best you don’t [1look-]\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: EXT. CITY STREETS\nROB: ROY (ROARING) There she goes! And that’s just the first! ‘Tis the beginning of the end for the City of Spires!\nROB: Now, brothers and sisters — run! Run! Release all the workers you can, then make for the hills, where our people are waiting!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. FILTRATION PLANT\nRILKE: Eh-? What was [that-?]\nJAMIE: Sounded like an explosion.\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Explosion-?\nRED: CAP We continue killing Doctor now-?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Oh — yes, yes, carry on —\nDOCTOR: (PULLED AGAIN) Aaagh-!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Pull-!

It is not safe for Red Caps!\nJAMIE: Aw, don’t say you’re scared of a few little bangs!\nRED: CAPS Red Caps — retreat. Suggest Overlord does same!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD) You — cannot! You are management class!\nDOCTOR: I think they’ve got the right idea —\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Cyprien! What have you done-?\nVICTOR: I did not build for you mere components. This whole City is one great machine. Now, I have indicated to the rebel MacGregor exactly the points of maximum stress within that machine —\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Be concise! We do not require a full technical report!\nDOCTOR: I think, what Victor’s trying to say is — he’s started a chain reaction. A sequence of explosions that will reduce the whole of Grangemouth to ashes.\nVICTOR: It is — like an engine. Like a great, infernal engine!\nVICTOR: (FX: THE BUILDING SHUDDERS AGAIN. MANY MORE EXPLOSIONS, OFF, FROM\nHERE: )\nMRS: CYPRIEN (STAGGERS, CRIES OUT) And if it falls apart with us inside—!\nVICTOR: Quick, the gantry is giving way —\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD) I must — depart... (HURRIES OFF DOWN GANTRY)\nRILKE: Sir-? Your orders-? Sir-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 153\nJAMIE: Your Overlord’s skipping the sinking ship. Now then, Sergeant — will you let us pass-?\nRILKE: I — I...\nJAMIE: Run, you fool! Run, or you’ll die as sure as the rest of us-!\nRILKE: (RUNS) Right!\nVICTOR: Alice, please — take my hand-!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Why — why have you done this, Victor?\nVICTOR: I built this place for me, Alice. I destroy it for you-!!!\nJAMIE: Aw, quit the lovey-dovey stuff and run-! (FX: THEY RUN) Now you, Doctor — (BEAT; WHERE IS HE?) Doctor-? (HOLLERING) Doctor-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. OVERFLOW PIPE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: HEYWARD WADING THROUGH A FOOT OF BLACK WATER. EXPLOSIONS OFF)\nDOCTOR: (OFF, BEHIND, IN PURSUIT) Overlord. Overlord-!!! There’s no shelter in the pipework-!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) (CALLING BACK) Stay back!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) All that’s going to happen is we’1ll ended up trapped in the twisted guts of your City. And what good will that do the Hirudin Corporation, hmm?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD)\nHEYWARD: Why are you here, Doctor? Why couldn’t you leave us alone? All we wanted was to turn a profit. Why was that wrong?\nDOCTOR: (STOPS) Who buys the oil, tell me that?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD) Oil-?\nDOCTOR: The ‘black water’, then.\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) (LAUGHS) Fool, the black water isn’t — (A THOUGHT) Did she send\nHEYWARD: you?\nDOCTOR: Who?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) You know who. You arrived from beyond this land. You know [who-]\nDOCTOR: Well... ? Tell me! I need to know!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Behind you, Doctor —\nDOCTOR: Oh no. Please don’t tell me this is the overflow pipe.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 155\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD)\nDOCTOR: Argh! (FX: THE WALL OF BLACK WATER HITS THEM)\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: EXT. STREETS\nJAMIE: (RUNNING UP) Alice. Victor, wait-! The Doctor — he must have gone after yon Overlord-!\nVICTOR: But — there’s no other exit from the plant-! (A THOUGHT) Unless...\nMRS: CYPRIEN What is it, Victor-?\nVICTOR: There is an overflow system, for when the filters become clogged. Normally, the pipes are clear —\nJAMIE: Aye, but where’s it lead-?\nVICTOR: Well, out of the system. Into the estuary. Into the Firth of Forth!\nMRS: CYPRIEN Then we must hurry!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: EXT. FIRTH OF FORTH\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WATER GUSHING FROM OVERFLOW PIPE, INTO THE RIVER. CITY\nEXPLODING: ABOVE AND OFF)\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD) (SPLUTTERING, FLOUNDERING IN WATER) (GRABBED) Gaah-! Doctor-?!?\nDOCTOR: (HOLDING ON TO HIM, KICKING LEGS IN WATER) No, no, no, You’re not getting away, “Overlord”. Not without telling me what it is I want to know-!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Don’t speak too soon, Doctor. This is an estuary!\nDOCTOR: So-? (PENNY DROPS) Oh, no —\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Where fresh water meets salt water! (GURGLES) This — is —a voluntary dissolution!\nDOCTOR: You haven’t got long. Tell me, what’s in the black water?\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD ) Aaah, the salt current is washing in. (FX: WATER FOAMING UP\nAROUND: HIM) Ohh, it burns —\nDOCTOR: (SHAKING HIM) What’s in it? Who buys it? I demand you tell me!\nHEYWARD: (OVERLORD)\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Well, so much for the Hirudin Corporation.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: EXT. OVERLOOKING GRANGEMOUTH (NEXT DAY)\nROB: ROY There, Doctor! Do you no’ hear that? Tis the sound of VICTORY!\nJAMIE: Aye, and of freedom! Freedom for Scotland!\nDOCTOR: What, the sound of a reservoir of wind being forced through a collection of reeds-?\nJAMIE: Aye — beautiful!\nDOCTOR: Personally, I could live without it.\nMRS: CYPRIEN So — Doctor — tell me, is this really the end?\nDOCTOR: Thanks to Victor here, I can’t see that refinery being used again, can you, Alice?\nVICTOR: Impossible. Quite impossible.\nDOCTOR: Which is just as well, if history is to run its proper course. Still, I’d have liked to have acquired an untainted sample of the black water, before it burned away to nothing. (A THOUGHT) The pump-jacks-!\nROB: ROY Aye. See there, on the horizon? That’s them hammerheads burning.\nVICTOR: You have fired the wells-?\nDOCTOR: So much for my sample.\nJAMIE: (NEEDLING VICTOR) And good riddance. Still, it’d have been better if those monstrous machines had never been built in the first place-!\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 159\nVICTOR: I.. I was uncivil to you before, McCrimmon. I must apologise. I owe you and the Doctor a very great debt.\nJAMIE: Your debt is to Scotland.\nVICTOR: Oui, and I shall do my best to pay it —\nROB: ROY The best thing you can do, laddie, is to leave these shores. Forever.\nVICTOR: I — am — expelled?\nROB: ROY Not by me. But there won’t be many so forgiving.\nMRS: CYPRIEN Victor — America is a wonderful place, I hear.\nVICTOR: But I would face my death here, than go there without you. Alice — what do you say-?\nMRS: CYPRIEN Victor, I —\nJAMIE: Och, I can’t be doing with this. (WALKS OFF. FX FOLLOW)\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING UP WITH JAMIE) Jamie. Wait. Jamie!\nJAMIE: (STOPPING) What is it you’re wanting now-?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I need to get back to Mullach. To my TARDIS.\nJAMIE: (WALKING) Och, the famous blue box.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I’ve a feeling there’s more to what happened here than meets the eye. There’s the damage to the timeline, for one; there’s the matter of who was buying the black water, and what, exactly, was in it; (STOPS) oh, and then there’s you.\nDOCTOR WHO: CITY OF SPIRES by Simon Bovey (FINAL) Page 160\nJAMIE: (STOPPED) Och, don’t you be starting with that business of my “other life”, travelling the stars. I’ve heard enough of that for now.\nDOCTOR: Alright. Alright. But aren’t you in the least bit curious? To see what travelling with me might have been like?\nJAMIE: Mebbe. Thing is, there’1ll still be Redcoats in the Highlands.\nDOCTOR: And you want to get back to killing them, I suppose?\nJAMIE: I was thinking more, you’ll be safest with someone by your side, if you’re planning on walking all the way back to Mullach?\nDOCTOR: Jamie, I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
