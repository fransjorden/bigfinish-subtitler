Troops and police have arrested nearly one hundred leaders of the so-called Mau Mau Insurgency in and around Nairobi, including their spokesman, Mr Jomo Kenyatta. The Mau Mau’s stated aims, as reported in their manifesto, are to take lands away from White settlers and place them in tribal hands. Reports from outlying towns and villages indicate a surge in violent activity, and there has been a rise in attacks on farms belonging to White settlers. These attacks are spreading to the areas outside Nairobi. Remaining Mau Mau leaders have reportedly taken refuge in the wilderness; the fighters allied to them are said to be already too well entrenched to be uprooted by the mass arrests.",

Can you here anything now?\nSYLVIA: (TARTLY) No, but I don’t think the composer ever considered using the sound of gunfire as an accompaniment to his music.\nLUCY: Tchaikovsky used cannons in the Eighteen Twelve Overture.\nSYLVIA: Tchaikovsky was a musical genius, and besides, he was writing about the defence of Moscow against Napoleon’s army. It’s difficult to write music about a war without incorporating some kind of reference to violence. Mr Scott Joplin, on the other hand, is a competent tinkerer who wrote disposable tunes for the masses.\nLUCY: You used to like it when they played Joplin at the Nairobi Tennis Club. You used to say you wanted to hear more.\nSYLVIA: I don’t believe I ever said that.\nLUCY: I remember Mr O’Donnell bought England, the last time he went. then put it away.\nLUCY: an LP back with him from You played it once, and\nSYLVIA: You are very young, Lucy. You have a lot to learn.\nLUCY: I wonder if anyone will write a symphony about this revolution.\nSYLVIA: (FIRMLY) This is not a revolution. This is a tawdry uprising on the part of some discontented natives who don’t know when they’re well off.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 5 of 133\nLUCY: Even so... It’s been a fortnight now. You would think that things would have calmed down. You would think we would have heard something.\nSYLVIA: The British Government will not let this situation go on for long. They will send the troops in, and everything will go back to the way it was.\nLUCY: (HUSHED) Sometimes I wonder if we’re the only white people left in Kenya.\nSYLVIA: (SHARPLY) Don’t be foolish, girl. Yes, the natives have cut the lines of communication, and taken control of a few Government buildings, but my husband and your father and veryone else are fighting back. Now, you go back to your letter, or whatever it is, and don’t worry about it.\nSYLVIA: (FX: THE TYPING STARTS AGAIN, TENTATIVE AT FIRST BUT THEN\nGETTING: STRONGER)\nLUCY: I’m writing to my father, letting him know how I am, and where I am.\nSYLVIA: There’s no post.

You heard the gong, I assume, so I won’t bang it again. Lunch isn’t much, I’m afraid. More tinned rations, and some sweet potatoes from the garden.\nSYLVIA: I’m sure it will be wonderful. (BEAT) How are the supplies holding up?\nDENISE: Oh, we’re managing. Christine eats like a bird anyway, and poor Lucy can’t keep anything down.\nSYLVIA: Still feeling rough, Lucy?\nLUCY: (APOLOGETIC) Running a bit of a temperature, I’m afraid.\nSYLVIA: You look a trifle flushed. You should get Elizabeth to take a look at you.\nLUCY: I already did. She said she thought it was just a touch of gyppy tummy. That and, you know... (EMBARASSED) ...the\nLUCY: stress of waiting, and not knowing about what’s happened to my family. She’s given me some powders.\nSYLVIA: We were lucky Elizabeth ended up here at the farm. I don’t know who better we could have hoped for than a doctor - (SOTTO VOCE) except perhaps a good pastry chef.\nDENISE: Have either of you seen Christine today? She didn’t answer just now.\nDENISE: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 7 of 133\nLUCY: She went for a lie down after breakfast. (CONSPIRATORIALLY) I think she’s got a touch of gyppy tummy too.\nKLEIN: (FROM OUTSIDE; RECOGNISABLY KLEIN NOW) I hope you didn’t start without me. Any news on the radio?\nSYLVIA: To date, the BBC World Service has been remarkably quiet about the Mau Mau uprising. They seem much more interested in the music of Scott Joplin. (BITTERLY) I blame the Prime Minister. Winston Churchill had no business taking Britain into the Second World War, and he’s a senile old fool now. I sometimes wonder if he’1l have the stomach to act against the rebels.\nLUCY: (AGHAST) You mean you think the Army’s not coming?\nSYLVIA: (SUDDENLY TIRED) I don’t know what I’m saying. I’m tired and I’m worried and I’m sick of listening out for the sound of gunfire. I just want it all to be over.\nKLEIN: I hate to sound like a cliché, but it’s quiet out there.\nKLEIN: Too quiet.\nSYLVIA: Better that than the alternative.\nLUCY: Can you see anything, Elizabeth?\nKLEIN: Nothing moving, apart from the breeze in the trees. The sky’s clouding over. I think we’re in for a storm.\nSYLVIA: Too early in the season for a storm.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 8 of 133\nKLEIN: I’ve been wondering - was this house built in a natural clearing, or did the owners deliberately cut down the jungle around it?\nSYLVIA: A little of both, I suspect.\nDENISE: I’ve been trying to remember who did own this farm.\nKLEIN: But I’d feel a lot happier if we could see the fence, or the main gates. I worry that the natives will get in without us knowing, and the first we’ll know about it is\nKLEIN: when we see them coming around a bend in the driveway, waving their guns.\nDENISE: I think it was the Braithwaites. Maude and Harold.\nSYLVIA: There are rifles or shotguns beside every window, upstairs and down, and Lucy and I have been checking every quarter hour.\nDENISE: Or the Thorneycrofts, perhaps.\nLUCY: I’ve been doing upstairs and Sylvia’s been doing downstairs.\nLUCY: (FX: SOUND OF A RIFLE BEING LIFTED AND THE BOLT DRAWN BACK, THEN CLOSED AGAIN)\nKLEIN: I see someone knows their way around a rifle.\nSYLVIA: So do you, apparently. (BEAT) My husband taught me to shoot when we first arrived in Kenya.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 9 of 133\nKLEIN: How very practical of him. (BEAT) Could you shoot a person? A man?\nSYLVIA: Oh yes.\nKLEIN: Perhaps we ought to set up a rota. Let each of us take a turn at the windows, upstairs and down.\nDENISE: Yes; 1 think @t was. the TRorneycrorts:, (BEAT) Don’t you think a rota is a little, well, officious? I mean, this isn’t Nazi Germany, is it?\nSYLVIA: (LEVEL) No. If it was, the natives wouldn’t be allowed to revolt.\nKLEIN: Well said.\nLUCY: I tell you what - I’11l pop upstairs and do a tour round the windows before we have lunch.\nKLEIN: Are you sure you’re feeling up to it?\nLUCY: Those powders you gave me helped settle my stomach.\nKLEIN: Good girl.\nSYLVIA: Check in on Christine. She shouldn’t be still asleep.\nKLEIN: (GRIMLY) Perhaps we ought to be setting up shifts. Two people asleep and three awake all the time, one on continuous sentry duty. That way we can’t be taken by surprise at night.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 10 of 133\nDENISE: Only three of us awake at any time? How could we play Bridge then?\nSLYVIA: Denise, my dear, I rather think we have bigger concerns than getting a four for Bridge.\nDENISE: (STIFFLY) I know there’s a revolution going on, but I don’t think we should let that be an excuse for letting our standards slip. We are British, after all. (BEAT) And talking of which, I’1l go and serve lunch up. Where are the servants when you need them?\nSYLVIA: Outside, setting fire to things, I think you’ll find.\nKLEIN: Ah, the British Empire at its glorious best.\nSYLVIA: A trifle bitter, there, Doctor Klein?\nKLEIN: Not bitter. Just... regretful.\nSYLVIA: Regretting what, exactly?\nKLEIN: Things that might have been.\nSYLVIA: Germany is a very progressive country, it seems to me. Always looking to the future. Just look at how you were allowed to become a doctor. You wouldn’t find that kind of\nSYLVIA: thing happening in Britain.\nKLEIN: Have you been to Germany, Mrs O’ Donnell?\nSYLVIA: (CAREFULLY) My husband is German. We met in Munich in Nineteen Thirty Three.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 11 of 133\nKLEIN: That must have been... awkward. Later.\nSYLVIA: Yes. (BEAT) O’Donnell is not my married name. Heinrich feels that we. should: use my surname: rather than his, Even now.\nKLEIN: Very wise.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 12 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 2: UPSTAIRS HALL\nKLEIN: (FX: THE STAIRS LEADING UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR. LUCY IS\nSKIPPING: BRIGHTLY UP THEM. HER FOOTSTEPS REACH THE LANDING, AND SLOW AS SHE NEARS A PARTICULAR DOOR)\nLUCY: Mrs MacCormack? Are you awake?\nLUCY: Christine, it’s Lucy. It’s nearly lunchtime!\nLUCY: Well, I’1ll make sure they leave a plate for you in the oven, to keep warm.\nLUCY: (FX: A FLUTTERING, WHIRRING SOUND BEHIND THE DOOR, LIKE SCRAPS OF PAPER BEING THROWN INTO THE PATH OF A FAN)\nLUCY: Mrs MacCormack, is that you?\nLUCY: Are you alright?\nLUCY: (UNSURE) Christine? (BEAT) I’11 get Doctor Klein.\nLUCY: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 13 of 133\nLUCY: SCENE 3: DINING ROOM\nLUCY: (FX: FADE TO THE DINING ROOM. THE SOUND OF CUTLERY CLINKING ON PLATES)\nLUCY: Oh, you started without me!\nDENISE: We did wait, but the food was going cold, and you were taking so long!\nKLEIN: How is Mrs MacCormack?\nLUCY: I think she’s still asleep, but...\nSYLVIA: But what, child?\nLUCY: I thought I heard something in her room.\nDENISE: (PANICKED) An intruder?\nLUCY: No. At least, I don’t think so. More like a fluttering, as if there was a bird trapped in there.\nSYLVIA: Don’t be fanciful. Christine wouldn’t have opened her windows, and even if she did I can’t imagine a bird flying inside.\nLUCY: Maybe she’s ill.\nKLEIN: I’1ll check in on her after lunch, but I’m sure she’s alright.\nLUCY: But what about that noise?\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 14 of 133\nSYLVIA: It was the wind, playing tricks.\nDENISE: Did you check the rest of the windows?\nLUCY: All the ones I could get to. There’s nothing out there but the jungle, and the clearing, and the animals. And the storm clouds.\nSYLVIA: Storm clouds? It’s not the rainy season yet, surely?\nSYLVIA: (FX: THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE TARDIS, LANDING, OUTSIDE IN THE JUNGLE)\nDENISE: Elizabeth, are you all right? It’s just thunder.\nKLEIN: (HALF IN SHOCK) Just thunder. Yes, of course it is. Sorry. Just had a dizzy turn.\nLUCY: Even the weather is rising up against us.\nDENISE: We should close the storm shutters.\nSYLVIA: If we do that we won’t be able to spot when the natives attack.\nLUCY: (SCARED) When?\nSYLVIA: Tt.\nKLEIN: I think it might be worth doing a tour of the boundary fence later. Just to check that there aren’t any breaks.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 15 of 133\nSYLVIA: I’1ll go. I could do with a walk.\nDENISE: I’1l go with you.\nSYLVIA: Can you handle a gun?\nDENISE: (PRIMLY) I’m sure it can’t be that hard.\nDENISE: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 16 of 133\nDENISE: SCENE 4: THE RAINFOREST\nDENISE: (FADE UP JUNGLE SOUNDS AND THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON EARTH AND LEAVES BEING BRUSHED ASIDE)\nSYLVIA: Well, this stretch is still intact. We must have covered half the boundary by now.\nDENISE: (BREATHLESS) Only half? It feels like we’ve been walking for hours.\nSYLVIA: You should play more tennis at the club.\nDENISE: I look forward to the time when I can.\nSYLVIA: So far I’ve not seen any breaks in the fence, or any signs that the Mau Mau are getting close. What about you?\nDENISE: I thought I saw smoke on the horizon earlier, but it might just have been heat haze. (SUDDENLY) Oh damn this place! Why can’t things just go back to the way they were? We\nDENISE: were happy. The natives were happy. At least, they always seemed that way. If they wanted to be treated differently they could have just told us, couldn’t they? There was no need for all this fighting and burning buildings.\nSYLVIA: All they’ve done is to prove they’re not grown up enough to run their own affairs. They’re like children. They need us to look after them. (BEAT) I think it’s time to move\nSYLVIA: on to the next section. Another hour or so should see us finished. And then I suggest we repair back to the house and settle into a couple of well-deserved gin-and-tonics.\nSYLVIA: (FX: DISTANTLY, A FLUTTERING, WHIRRING SOUND, AS BEFORE IN THE HOUSE)\nSYLVIA: Denise? What’s the matter?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 17 of 133\nDENISE: I thought... I thought I saw something moving, through the trees over there.\nSYLVIA: (SHARPLY) A person?\nDENISE: I’m not sure. I just saw a flash of colour. Turquoise, and iridescent, like silk.\nSYLVIA: (SCORNFUL) You saw someone wearing a blue silk dress in the middle of the rainforest? Let’s hope they can play bridge as well.\nDENISE: I didn’t see a person. It was more like... leaves caught in a sudden flurry of wind. Blue leaves, or petals, or something - spinning. And then it was gone.\nSYLVIA: No gin-and-tonic for you when we get back.\nDENISE: I’m going over to take a look.\nSYLVIA: I’l1l cover you from here. No sense in us both going.\nSYLVIA: Anything?\nDENISE: (DISTANT, SHOCKED) Oh my good Lord!\nSYLVIA: What is it?\nDENISE: Come and look!\nDENISE: Doctor Who —- A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 18 of 133\nDENISE: (FX: WE MOVE WITH SYLVIA TOWARDS WHERE DENISE IS. AS WE DO SO, DENISE’S VOICE GETS LOUDER)\nDENISE: (FLUSTERED) I thought at first it was just a fallen tree trunk, but it’s not. It’s a body, covered in blood.\nSYLVIA: (PRACTICAL) A native, do you think?\nDENISE: It must be.\nSYLVIA: So thin! Look at its knees and elbows. They’re swollen like turnips.\nDENISE: It’s malnourished!\nSYLVIA: There’s something not right about this. I’m no doctor, but surely legs and arms bend in the middle, not there.\nDENISE: (INCREDULOUS) And look - there’s another joint!\nSYLVIA: It’s got two knees in each leg!\nDENISE: And two elbows in each arm. I think it’s got a...a deformity of some kind.\nSYLVIA: Or a disease. Leprosy might cause something like this. Or polio.\nDENISE: (SHOCKED) Sylvia, look - it’s alive!\nSYLVIA: (URGENT) We should kill it.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 19 of 133\nDENISE: What?\nSYLVIA: It’s not one of us. Not British. I don’t know whether it’s a native or some kind of strange ape, but I think it’s dangerous. It might be infectious.\nDENISE: I don’t think leprosy can make a person look like this. It\nDENISE: looks more like the result of a car accident. You know what I mean —- bones broken and then reset badly. (DECISIVE) I think Elizabeth needs to take a look at it.\nSYLVIA: Are you mad?\nDENISE: (DEFIANT) it may not. be British, but we are... Lf we just left it here we’d be no better than the Mau Mau!\nSYLVIA: If we take it back we could be signing our own death warrants.\nDENISE: Surely we’re better than that. We have a responsibility to look after the sick and injured.\nSYLVIA: (UNHAPPY) All right. All right. (THINKS) Get me some branches while I pull down some vines.\nDENISE: What are you going to do?\nSYLVIA: If you intend pressing ahead with this lunacy then the least I can do is help make a stretcher. This... thing may be small, but it’s still going to be an effort getting it\nSYLVIA: back to the house.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 20 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 5: A BEDROOM\nKLEIN: Well it’s not a native, that’s for sure. You can get quite a variation in African tribes, from pygmies like the Biaka or the Twa to extremely tall and thin like the Watusi, but I’ve never heard of anything like this before. And the joints are natural, not the result of a deformity or an illness.\nDENISE: We thought it might be an animal of some kind. A previously undiscovered species.\nKLEIN: Possible, I suppose. (BEAT) The fingers are long, indicating some kind of arboreal heritage. And it has an opposable thumb. (BEAT) No, make that two opposable thumbs. How very odd. (BEAT) The crainial development indicates a large brain. If it’s an ape then it’s somewhere up at the chimpanzee or gorilla level, rather than a new type of marmoset.\nDENISE: We can’t keep calling it\nDENISE: N“ +\nDENISE: at\nDENISE: We need to give it a name.\nSYLVIA: Oh how twee. You’ll be knitting it clothes next.\nDENISE: Abraham. Abe the Ape.\nSYLVIA: (QUIET) Dear god preserve us.\nKLEIN: Interesting.\nKLEIN: (FX: THE SOUND OF WATER SPLASHING IN A BOWL, THEN A SPONGE\nBEING: USED AGAINST SKIN)\nKLEIN: This blood on its skin is coming from these scratches. Hundred of them. Thousands. Tiny scratches, all over its\nKLEIN: body.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 21 of 133\nSYLVIA: Knife scratches?\nKLEIN: Too small.\nDENISE: Was it tortured?\nKLEIN: Too many questions and not enough answers. (BEAT) It’s asleep now. Let it rest. I’11 make a full examination later.\nSYLVIA: I think we ought to tie it to the bed.\nDENISE: Don’t be silly. It’s barely larger than a child.\nKLEIN: Denise, see if you can find a key to fit the lock on this bedroom door. At least we can stop it wandering around the house when it wakes up. I think -\nSYLVIA: What in Heaven’s name is that?\nDENISE: Someone’s at the door.\nSYLVIA: It can’t be Lucy - she’s still in the drawing room, writing her letter.\nKLEIN: And as far as I know, Christine is still asleep in her room.\nDENISE: (WHISPERS) Is it... the Mau Mau?\nDENISE: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 22 of 133\nSYLVIA: If it is, they’re displaying considerably more politeness than I would have expected of them.\nSYLVIA: (FX: MORE KNOCKING. IT MIGHT OCCUR TO US THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE HANDLE OF AN UMBRELLA HITTING THE WOODEN DOOR)\nKLEIN: Well - shall we answer it?\nSYLVIA: Denise - bring the rifle.\nSYLVIA: (FX: THE THREE WOMEN LEAVE THE BEDROOM AND WALK DOWN THE STAIRS)\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 23 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 6: THE HALL\nLUCY: (AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, BUT GETTING LOUDER AS THEY APPROACH) Is it the Army? Are we rescued?\nSYLVIA: Stand back. Denise are you ready?\nDENISE: Just about.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR Good afternoon, ladies. Might I borrow a cup of sugar?\nLUCY: Who is it? I can’t see.\nDENISE: It’s a white man in a linen suit. And he’s got an umbrella!\nSYLVIA: Are you from the British Government?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Were you expecting someone?\nSYLVIA: We were rather hoping for the Army.\nDENISE: Or the Diplomatic Corps.\nSYLVIA: Or even a decent pastry chef.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I’m sorry to disappoint you. May I come in?\nDENISE: Oh, where are our manners? Yes, please do come in.\nDENISE: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 24 of 133\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR I am the Doctor.\nSYLVIA: We already have a doctor. (BEAT) Where’s Elizabeth? She was here a moment ago.\nLUCY: I think she popped back upstairs. (BEAT) I’m Lucy, by the way. Lucy Watts.\nSYLVIA: Sylvia O’Donnell.\nDENISE: Denise Waterford.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR Charmed to meet you. And what a lovely place you have here. You can stop pointing that rifle at me, by the way.\nDENISE: Oh, pardon me. I forgot I was holding it.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR Is it just the four of you here?\nSYLVIA: Christine is asleep upstairs. Christine MacCormack.\nDENISE: And there’s Abraham.\nSYLVIA: (INTERRUPTING) What’s the news from England?\nLUCY: Are the Army coming?\nDENISE: How much of the country do the Mau Mau control?\nDENISE: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 25 of 133\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR (TO HIMSELF) The Mau Mau Uprising? Kenya, 1950s. Yes, of course! (TO THE WOMEN) I’m pleased to be able to tell you\nDENISE: that the British Government is pursuing a diplomatic solution through dialogue with the rebel spokesman, Jomo Kenyatta. The worst of the fighting is over, but I fear that the country you knew is gone forever. Self-rule is the inevitable outcome.\nSYLVIA: Ridiculous. The natives can’t govern themselves. They can barely grow enough food to keep themselves alive, and the\nSYLVIA: different tribes are always at each others’ throats.\nDENISE: Would you like a cup of tea?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: That would be exceptionally kind. (TO HIMSELF) From rifles to tea in less than a minute. That’s a record, even for me.\nSYLVIA: How exactly did you get here? We would have heard a car.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Oh, I have my own transport.\nLUCY: One man, parachuted alone into the dark heart of Africa to reach an accommodation with the rebellious natives. How romantic.\nSYLVIA: How foolhardy.\nDENISE: Are you alone?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR For the nonce. Why do you ask?\nDENISE: We found someone in the rainforest earlier. They were... injured\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR How very interesting. It does sound like something that would generally happen to any companion of mine, but for now I’m traveling by myself.\nDENISE: Doctor Klein thinks that the person we found is deformed in\nDENISE: some way.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 26 of 133\nLUCY: Doctor Klein?\nLUCY: Yes, do you know her?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: Blonde,\nLUCY: blue eyed and strikingly attractive? Hint of a\nLUCY: German accent?\nLUCY: Yes.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR I believe our paths have crossed.\nDENISE: How lovely.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: inter]\nDENISE: loper.\nDENISE: as wel\nDENISE: Ll.\nDENISE: I think it’s time I met this strange And the creature you found in the rainforest\nDENISE: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 27 of 133\nDENISE: SCENE 7: A BEDROOM\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR (OUTSIDE) Hello?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: Well well well, what do we have here. You’re not from this planet, are you my friend? Two joints in each limb, reticulated skin, and those eyes. You have possibly the\nDENISE: saddest eyes I have ever seen.\nKLEIN: I concur. Apart from the bit about the eyes. That’s just poetic licence.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Doctor Klein, I presume. Please, don’t stay in the shadows. Come into the light.\nKLEIN: (ALMOST IN AWE) I had a feeling we would meet again, somewhere, somehow. At first it was a certainty, then a hope, then just a dream.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Oh, I never had any doubt about it.\nKLEIN: (STILL DREAMILY) That was your TARDIS I heard earlier! I thought I was imagining things.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Still lusting after it so that you can go back and change history?\nKLEIN: (GETS A GRIP ON HERSELF) Change it back, you mean.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You still believe that your reality is the right one, and this one is some kind of monstrous mistake?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 28 of 133\nKLEIN: I remember a world that doesn’t exist, and never will. I remember people who have never been born. Sometimes I think I’m going mad. Other times I think you’re the one who’s insane. You must be insane to believe you have to right to just reorder reality the way you want.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Not the way I want. The way it should be.\nKLEIN: No Miss McShane this time around? I’m sure I would have heard her by now, if she was here.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I’m traveling on my own now. And what about you - where have you been hiding yourself away since our last encounter?\nKLEIN: After the war ended in that farcical victory for Britain I escaped to South America. There’s quite a little colony of National Socialists down there. A home away from home.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Yes, I remember bumping into one of them. Mister De Flores, I believe. He was just as fanatical as you. It must be something in the water down there.\nKLEIN: (REMINISCING) Ah, Hans. He was always the Fuhrer’s favourite. I hope that one day, when the Fourth Reich emerges to take its rightful place leading the world, Hans will be the new Fuhrer.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And will he-make ‘the trains: run on. time?\nKLEIN: You say that as if it’s a bad thing to have a predictable transport system.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who —- A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 29 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR That rather depends on how you make the trains run on time, and what happens to the drivers who are late.\nKLEIN: I’m not going to be distracted by simplistic moralising. You believe this creature to be from the stars?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR It’s not native to Earth, I know that much. I don’t recognize the species, however.\nKLEIN: So the double joints and the colour of its skin are natural.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: As far as I can tell. But these scratches all over its body concern me. I presume you didn’t make them yourself in some despicable attempt to extract information from it\nKLEIN: Scratches as shallow as this are no use in interrogations...\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (MURMURS) I bow to your superior expertise\nKLEIN: And I can’t see how they could have been caused in a fight. They would have been much deeper and more savage.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Which leaves..?\nKLEIN: The best theory I can come up with is that the creature ran through a thorn bush, and scratched itself badly. I would have given it a tetanus shot and some antibiotics, but if it really does come from the stars then I might just end up poisoning it.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR That’s very Hippocratic of you.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 30 of 133\nKLEIN: Whatever you may think of us, Doctor, the National Socialists were never barbarians. We did what we did for the betterment of the human race.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (ANGRY) And when Doctor Mengele gave twins the same dose of poison in order to see whether they would take the same amount of time to die, was that justified? Did that add to the sum of human knowledge?\nKLEIN: (TIRED) Doctor Mengele had only the best motives, but his methods were... questionable. Even the Fuhrer came to\nKLEIN: acknowledge that. But you shouldn’t tar the entire Third\nKLEIN: Reich with the actions of just one man. Would you like me to list all the British and American researchers who have\nKLEIN: committed abuses against their fellow man?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (BITTER) Don’t bother. The history of humanity is a history of abuse by the more powerful directed against the less powerful. Sometimes I wonder why I like your species so much.\nKLEIN: And is it different out in the stars, Doctor? Is it all peace and light out there?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (DEFLATED) Not so you would notice.\nKLEIN: And there was I thinking you had the moral high ground, when you’re just fighting down on the lowlands with the rest of us.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 31 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 8: THE KITCHEN\nDENISE: (SINGING THE THEME TUNE TO ‘THE ARCHERS’ — ‘BARWICK GREEN’ FROM THE SUITE MY NATIVE HEATH, WRITTEN IN 1924 BY THE\nYORKSHIRE: COMPOSER ARTHUR WOOD IF YOU WANT TO KNOW) Rum-te- tum-te-tum-te-tum, rum-te-tum-te-tuum-tum.\nSYLVIA: There’s another plate over on the Aga. It looks like someone left their lunch. Do you want me to pass it over?\nDENISE: Oh drat. I put that out for Christine, but I completely forgot to take it up to her. (BEAT) I’11 take it up now.\nDENISE: I know it’s cold, but she might still fancy it.\nDENISE: (FX: DENISE’S FOOTSTEPS AS SHE LEAVES THE KITCHEN AND HEADS ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS. SHE STOPS)\nDENISE: Christine? Are you awake, dear?\nDENISE: Christine? It’s Denise. (BEAT) I’ve got some lunch for you. I’11l just leave it inside the door.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR What is it?\nDENISE: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 32 of 133\nSYLVIA: What’s the matter?\nKLEIN: Are you alright?\nDENISE: It’s Christine...\nSYLVIA: Look at her! There’s blood everywhere!\nKLEIN: (BLEAKLY) Every square inch of skin has been sliced open.\nDENISE: Is she dead?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR Yes. And I fear this is just the beginning...\nDENISE: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 33 of 133\nDENISE: EPISODE TWO\nDENISE: Christine? It’s Denise. (BEAT) I’ve got some lunch for you. I’ll just leave it inside the door.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR What is it?\nSYLVIA: What’s the matter?\nKLEIN: Are you alright?\nDENISE: It’s Christine...\nSYLVIA: Look at her! There’s blood everywhere!\nKLEIN: (BLEAKLY) Every square inch of skin has been siiceéd open.\nDENISE: Is she dead?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR Yes. And I fear this is just the beginning...\nDENISE: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 34 of 133\nDENISE: SCENE 9: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: What on Earth happened to her?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I rather think she was attacked by something.\nLUCY: Look at the window. It’s been smashed to smithereens.\nSYLVIA: It’s that creature the one we found in the jungle. It’s\nSYLVIA: slaughtered Christine and escaped.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Doctor Klein and I have been with the creature, and it’s unconscious.\nKLEIN: And look - the glass is on the inside, which means that whatever it was came into the house from outside.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And presumably went back out the same way.\nDENISE: Is that what made the scratches on her body? The smashing glass?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR I think not.\nKLEIN: Look there are scratches on her legs beneath her skirt, and on her arms under her sleeves. (BEAT) And on her scalp, beneath the hair. Glass slivers couldn’t have penetrated all that way. Something got close and attacked her.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And remember the scratches on the body of that poor unfortunate creature in the other room.\nDENISE: Abraham? But he’s still alive.\nDENISE: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 35 of 133\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: Exactly. Which means that the question isn’t “what killed your friend here”. No, the real question is: “why is your friend dead and Abraham still alive?”\nKLEIN: Actually, I think you’1ll find that the real question is: “which one of us is going to be next?”\nSYLVIA: What are you implying?\nKLEIN: There’s some kind of animal on the loose. It’s come into the house once, by smashing a window, and presumably left the same way. You don’t need to be Werner Von Braun to work out that it could do it again.\nLUCY: What makes you think it’s an animal? Surely it’s more likely to be the Mau Mau?\nSYLVIA: Elizabeth is right. If it was the Mau Mau, they’d still be here, in the house.\nDENISE: Are we sure they’re not?\nSYLVIA: I really think we’d know about it by now if they were. Psychological terror is not really their forte. They’d be\nSYLVIA: attacking us at this very moment with spears and machetes.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR In which case, might I recommend that your first course of action should be to bar all the windows?\nDENISE: That could take hours. And where are we going to get the wood?\nLUCY: We could close the storm shutters. They’re meant to be able to stand up to monsoon weather.\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 36 of 133\nSYLVIA: Lucy’s right.\nDENISE: But they can’t be locked.\nSYLVIA: They don’t need to be locked if this thing is just some kind of animal. And anyway, we could use a chain, or string, to tie the shutters together, just to be sure.\nDENISE: (ALMOST WAILING) But how are we going to see if the Mau Mau are approaching the house if the storm shutters are closed?\nSYLVIA: (ALMOST KINDLY) One problem at a time, dear. One problem\nSYLVIA: at a time. (BEAT) Lucy, you and Elizabeth take the ground floor. Denise, you and I will take this floor. Doctor...\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Oh, I’1ll stay here. Once I secure the storm shutters on\nSYLVIA: this window, I’1l1 pop across and take another look at our friend Abraham. Somehow he’s the key to all this. I feel sure of it.\nDENISE: And what about... (SOBS) What about Christine? What are we going to do about her?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: Doctor Klein and I need to examine her body for evidence that might allow us to identify what kind of animal killed her.\nSYLVIA: And then?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: (HARSHLY) And then we sew her up in a shroud made from bedsheets and we bury her outside, deep enough so that the hyenas won’t be able to get to her.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 37 of 133\nKLEIN: (CALMING) Doctor - remember, they’ve just lost a friend. We all have.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (DARKLY) There’1l be time enough to mourn later. For now, survival is our priority.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 38 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 10: THE GARDEN\nKLEIN: There. Do you think that’s deep enough?\nSYLVIA: I’ve got no way of judging. I’ve never had to do this kind of thing before. (BEAT) IT think it’1l be fine.\nSYLVIA: (BITTERLY) Why not seek the Doctor’s opinion? He seems to know everything!\nKLEIN: He does like to give that impression.\nSYLVIA: Should we trust him? After all, he turned up only a few minutes before we found poor Christine.\nKLEIN: We shouldn’' and arrogant\nKLEIN: trust him an inch. He’s devious, manipulative\nKLEIN: cr CT\nSYLVIA: (SHOCKED) But he seems so innocuous.\nKLEIN: (DARKLY) That’s his greatest asset.\nSYLVIA: I thought you two knew each other?\nSYLVIA: We were never friends.\nSYLVIA: If you don’t mind me asking, where did you meet?\nKLEIN: Chronologically? It was at Colditz Castle in 1943.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 39 of 133\nSYLVIA: How strange. My husband... Hans... was stationed near there for a while during the war. (BEAT) He was in the Waffen SS. (BEAT) I’ve never really told anyone that before.\nKLEIN: People judge. All Germans are Nazis, all Nazis are like the Gestapo, all Gestapo are monsters. So simple. So wrong.\nSYLVIA: But it wasn’t like that, before the war. The Mitford Girls were back and forth between Britain and Germany all the time. We had grand balls, and parties, and the officers were all so fine in their uniforms. Britain and Germany were friends. And then it all went wrong, and nobody could admit to knowing any Germans any more. Which is why we had to come to Kenya. (BEAT) I suppose we ought to get\nSYLVIA: veryone together. Say a few words about Christine.\nKLEIN: Did you know her very well?\nSYLVIA: Her husband was in trade. We didn’t really move in the same circles. I’d bump into her now and then in Nairobi. She was a member of the tennis club, although I’m not sure who put her up.\nKLEIN: She seemed... pleasant.\nSYLVIA: “Pleasant”. Not much of an epitaph.\nKLEIN: I don’t think there is such a thing as a good epitaph. How do you sum a person’s whole life up in a few well-chosen words?\nSYLVIA: What would you want them to say about you?\nKLEIN: (MEANINGFULLY) That I put things right.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 40 of 133\nSYLVIA: Yes. (BEAT) Yes, I’d be happy with that as well.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 41 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 11: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: (FX: ABRAHAM IS SLEEPING. HE MOANS FROM TIME TO TIME IN AN\nALIEN: FASHION)\nLUCY: (LUCY IS SOUNDING TIRED AND WOOZY... NOT TOO MUCH, BUT JUST ENOUGH TO NOTICE)\nLUCY: Do you think he’1ll ever wake up?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR I don’t even know what’s keeping him asleep.\nLUCY: He looks so strange. Like a lost child.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but that’s no guarantee of good behaviour. Poor\nDOCTOR: Abraham here could be a mass murderer or a slave, a megalomaniac financier or a pirate. We just don’t know.\nLUCY: You say that as if he’s intelligent, like us. But surely he’s either a native who’s horribly deformed or he’s some kind of, oh, I don’t know, hairless ape or something.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: Strange, but some of my best friends have been hairless apes. (BEAT) Abraham here may look strange to your eyes, but try to see beyond that. Just because something is\nLUCY: different doesn’t mean that it is inferior.\nLUCY: If my father was here he’d say you were some kind of Bolshevik, talking like that. (BEAT) I think I’m going to go for a lie down, if you don’t mind. I’m feeling a little Sick.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: (CONCERNED) You’re looking flushed. Let me feel your forehead.\nLUCY: Your hands are cold.\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 42 of 133\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR You know what they say - cold hands, two hearts. (BEAT) You’re running a temperature.\nLUCY: Elizabeth said she thought I had a touch of, you know, “digestive problems”. She gave me something to settle my\nLUCY: stomach. Andrews Liver Salts.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR I didn’t realize she was medically qualified. How long have you had that rash on your neck?\nLUCY: What rash?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR I don’t remember seeing it earlier. Hmm. Yes, you do need to rest, I think. Perhaps some antibiotics would help.\nLUCY: I’1l be in my room.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: (TO HIMSELF) I feel as if I’ve got half the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and the top of the box is missing. (BEAT) What do you think, my friend?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR (DARKLY) Yes, that’s your answer to everything.\nKLEIN: Talking to yourself, Doctor?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR It’s the only way I get any intelligent debate. (BEAT) I’m worried about young Lucy.\nKLEIN: (EVASIVE) I know she’s feeling a bit under the weather, but she’s been under a lot of stress.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 43 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: She’s also got a rash developing on her neck. It’s come up fast - it wasn’t there half an hour ago. My first thought was meningitis, but the rash fades if you press on it.\nKLEIN: Damn. (BEAT) Damn. It’s not like I have access to a full range of medical supplies here. I can diagnose, but I’m\nKLEIN: pretty much stumped when it comes to treatment.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I didn’t realize you had a medical qualification. I’d assumed your doctorate was in physics.\nKLEIN: I had to do something to pass the time while I was in South America, so I requalified. There were plenty of German doctors around who had time on their hands.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And yet you ended up here, in Africa.\nKLEIN: The Dark Continent has always held a fascination for me. couldn’t see myself whiling away the years dreaming of past glories. Like Hans De Flores and his wolfpack. And I spent far too long as it was dreaming of future glories that aren’t going to happen.\nKLEIN: H\nKLEIN: ct ct\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Unless you help them along. You still haven’t given up your dream of recasting the future in the image you remember, have you?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 44 of 133\nKLEIN: Invmy version. of history, the Third Reich controlled ‘this entire continent. When the Mau Mau started their rebellion they were crushed instantly. Wave upon wave of German aircraft swept overhead, carpet-bombing the tribal areas. We wiped them out. That’s how to manage a continent, Doctor. No debate, no negotiation, just an instant and overwhelming response. (BEAT) But here, in your milk and water world, the only forces that will be sent in will be battalions of men in pin-stripe suits and bowler hats to reason with the upstart natives by talking slowly in loud voices. Kenya will get its independence, and it won’t be the last country to do so. And in fifty years time this continent will have degenerated into a mass of squabbling\nKLEIN: tribes and minor civil wars. No order. No cohesion. Just chaos.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Perhaps. But there’s something else, isn’t there? Something you’re not telling me.\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) How annoyingly perceptive of you. Yes, when the carpet-bombing had stopped, and the various native tribes had been eradicated, we sent in teams of builders to construct new cities. Within three years, most of them\nKLEIN: were dead. Some kind of disease - a virulent plague like nothing anyone had ever seen before. It wasn’t infectious, but it was carried by something - the wind, insects... The\nKLEIN: Fuhrer put me in charge of a team of doctors and sent me to investigate, but we were all evacuated before I could make any progress. (BEAT) It was years before we dared come back into Africa.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And that’s why you requalified as a doctor. You want to solve the puzzle?\nKLEIN: don’t often fail, Doctor. I like to make a difference.

THE VOLUME OF THE RADIO INCREASES AS THE MUSIC FINISHES. THERE IS A MOMENT OF SILENCE)\nBBC: RADIO ANNOUNCER (MALE, SOUNDING AS IF HE IS WEARING A DINNER JACKET, DISTORTED AND STATICY)\nBBC: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 47 of 133\nBBC: This 1s BBC World Service. Here is the news.\nBBC: In Kenya, it has been reported that Governor Sir Evelyn Baring has declared a State of Emergency just two weeks after taking up office. Troops and police have arrested nearly one hundred leaders of the so-called Mau Mau Insurgency in and around Nairobi, including their spokesman, Mr Jomo Kenyatta. The Mau Mau’s stated aims, as reported in their manifesto, are to take lands away from White settlers and place them in tribal hands. Reports from outlying towns and villages indicate a surge in violent activity, and there has been a rise in attacks on farms belonging to White settlers. These attacks are spreading to the areas outside Nairobi. Remaining Mau Mau leaders have reportedly taken refuge in the wilderness; the fighters allied to them are said to be already too well entrenched to be uprooted by the mass arrests.\nBBC: Unconfirmed reports from London state that a battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers has been flown from the Middle East to Nairobi, while a Royal Navy cruiser is heading for Mombasa Harbor carrying a further battalion of Royal Marines. European settlers are asked to stay calm and to wait for the British Army to arrive.\nBBC: And now, the economy...\nDENISE: How wonderful! The Army’s been sent in to help!\nSYLVIA: Yes, but attacks against White farms and European settlers are on the increase. Which one will get to us first - the\nSYLVIA: Army or the Mau Mau?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 48 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 13: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: So your contention is what - that the carpet bombing your people inflicted on this continent somehow spread a disease that had been confined to a small local area?\nKLEIN: It’s not beyond the realms of possibility. The heat and humidity of this place causes bacteria and viruses to evolve quicker than anywhere on the planet. Most of the more deadly diseases started off in Africa, some of them crossing species boundaries from animals to humans and becoming more virulent in the process. Look at Ebola, HIV, Malaria, the Marburg virus... Africa is a crucible for deadly plagues.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I think he’s waking up!\nKLEIN: Maybe he can tell us what this thing is that killed Christine. (BEAT) Can you hear me? Nod if you can hear me. (BEAT) Nothing. Maybe he doesn’t speak English.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: That shouldn’t matter. Let me try. (BEAT) (SOFTLY) Don’t be frightened my friend. I’m the Doctor, and this is... er, my friend Doctor Klein. We’re here to help you.\nKLEIN: Is that a language?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR If it was, I’d be able to understand it.\nKLEIN: Don’t tell me you’re fluent in all of the local native languages.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 49 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: The TARDIS allows me to understand any language, human or alien. Except for Esperanto which, for some reason, it’s never been able to get the hang of.\nKLEIN: I’d wondered how you and Miss McShane were so fluent in German. (BEAT) He’s obviously trying to communicate -\nKLEIN: just look at his eyes.\nABE: THE DOCTOR I wish we could understand what you were trying to tell us. Let me examine your throat. Just... yes, tip your head\nABE: back. That’s right. Open wide. Say “antidisestablishmentarianism”.\nABE: THE DOCTOR That’s close enough.\nKLEIN: What are you looking for?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Vocal cords. They’re well developed. The tongue as well. Abe here shouldn’t have any trouble speaking. He’s got all the physical equipment, and his cranial capacity indicates intelligence, but something is stopping him from actually forming the right words.\nKLEIN: Perhaps he just doesn’t want to.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (DARKLY) Or somebody else doesn’t want him to.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 50 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 14: SITTING ROOM\nDENISE: (TO HERSELF) Knit one... drop one... pearl one...\nSYLVIA: You’d be better off putting it on a leash and letting it run around outside.\nSYLVIA: (FX: A SUDDEN SMASHING OF GLASS, AND A THUD AS SOMETHING HITS THE STORM SHUTTERS)\nDENISE: What in Heaven’s name was that?\nSYLVIA: (GRIMLY) Move away from the window. And pass me that shotgun!\nDENISE: Here. (BEAT) Do you think something is trying to get in?\nSYLVIA: I’m sure of it.\nSYLVIA: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS. THE DOCTOR AND KLEIN ENTER THE ROOM)\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR What was that noise?\nSYLVIA: Something smashed the window.\nKLEIN: Good thing the storm shutters were closed.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And it’s a good thing that whatever it was the tried to get in couldn’t force its way through them.\nKLEIN: (FX: SOUND OF SOMEONE FIDDLING WITH THE WOODEN STORM\nSHUTTERS: )\nSHUTTERS: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 51 of 133\nSYLVIA: What are you doing?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Taking a look outside.\nSYLVIA: Be careful it might still be out there!\nSYLVIA: (FX: THE SHUTTERS OPEN. SHARDS OF GLASS FALL TO THE WINDOWSILL)\nKLEIN: I think you’d better give me the shotgun.\nSYLVIA: Why?\nKLEIN: Because the way your hands are shaking you’re just as likely to shoot the Doctor as anything else. And while there have been times when I would have supported you, I think we need him now.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: can see multiple points of impact large and irregular crashed against the window back until it shattered.\nKLEIN: here, as if something the shutters, pushing\nSYLVIA: A shotgun blast, perhaps?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: No -— there’s no damage to the shutters themselves, and no\nSYLVIA: pellets. (BEAT) I suggest that we evacuate this room and lock the door. We’ll set up base camp in the dining room.\nDENISE: Oh, that reminds me. I was going to do an omelette for dinner, but we’ve got no eggs in the house. I need to pop out to the henhouse. Can someone come with me and stand guard?\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR\nDENISE: It’s dangerous out there. I don’t think wandering around\nDENISE: is recommended.\nDENISE: Doctor Who —- A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 52 of 133\nKLEIN: I’1ll come. I could do with stretching my legs.\nDENISE: If I pick some more sweet potatoes I can do a potato salad as well.\nDENISE: THE DOCTOR If you’re set on going out then I’d better come with you. I want to check on this window from the outside anyway.\nSYLVIA: Whatever for?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Scratches. If I can find some then I might be able to estimate the size of the creature that smashed the window.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 53 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 15: THE GARDEN\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Yes, just as I suspected. Look at this.\nKLEIN: But they’re tiny.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Tiny little scratches all over the window frame and the shutters.\nKLEIN: Just like the tiny scratches on the creature’s body.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And on the unfortunate Christine. (BEAT) Where did Denise go?\nKLEIN: Denise?\nDENISE: (DISTANT) Over here, by the henhouse.\nKLEIN: So what are we dealing with here? A horde of very small monkeys?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Not quite. Unless they are flying monkeys. (REFLECTIVE) I used to have arguments with Frank L. Baum about that. I\nKLEIN: told him that if monkeys had wings then technically they wouldn’t be monkeys any more, but he wouldn’t listen.\nKLEIN: What do you mean?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR The Wizard of Oz.\nKLEIN: I meant about flying. Not about monkeys.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 54 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You’re right, this is not about monkeys. Look there.\nKLEIN: What is that?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR A feather. A tiny blue feather.\nKLEIN: (AMAZED) The bird it belongs to would be about the size of my thumb.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR There’s something... ah, yes. Got it. Yes, As I suspected. Hold your hand out.\nKLEIN: What are you..? Oh. It’s sharp.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I suspect a high concentration of metallic ions. Be careful with it - don’t let it scratch you. The feather is immensely soft and flexible, but capable of inflicting a\nKLEIN: nasty wound if it slices against your skin edge on.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 55 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 16: THE HALL\nKLEIN: (FX: SOUND OF SOMEONE COMING DOWN THE STAIRS. THEY ARE\nWALKING: CAREFULLY)\nSYLVIA: Lucy? My dear, I thought you were resting.\nLUCY: (GROGGY) I came down for a glass of water. I tried to rest, honestly I did, but I couldn’t sleep. My skin itches, and I’ve got a headache.\nSYLVIA: You’ve got a rash on your neck, dear. (BEAT) And your arms.\nLUCY: It looks a bit like a heat rash, but I’m feeling shivery.\nSYLVIA: I’ll get Elizabeth to take a look at you when she comes back.\nLUCY: Where is she?\nSYLVIA: Outside, with Denise and that strange little man.\nLUCY: Isn’t it dangerous out there?\nSYLVIA: (DRYLY) The lure of the sweet potato was just too strong.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 56 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 17: THE GARDEN\nKLEIN: Oh hell, I’ve lost her again. (CALLS) Denise?\nDENISE: (DISTANT, MUFFLED) I’m in the henhouse.\nKLEIN: (CALLS) What are you doing in the henhouse?\nDENISE: Checking for eggs. Sometimes they lay them in the corners.\nKLEIN: (TO HERSELF) You learn something every day.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I’m still trying to get a handle on the layout of this place. The encroaching rainforest makes it difficult to get a clear idea of where things are, and that could be\nKLEIN: important.\nKLEIN: The farmhouse you can see. The area around it was cleared of bushes and trees for a few hundred yards by the owners, whoever they were. Then we’ve got the hen house and the allotment areas where they were growing vegetables. On the other side of the house there’s pasture area for cows, but they’ve all wandered off, or been taken. And after that there’s a ring of about half a mile of rainforest before you get to the boundary fence. I guess that they were intending to clear all that as well, at some stage.\nDOCTOR: And that driveway leads to a gate in the fence?\nKLEIN: Which you would have seen if you hadn’t arrived out of the blue. Literally.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nKLEIN: Couldn’t we just use your TARDIS to get out of here?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 57 of 133 THE DOCTOR What, and leave the mystery unresolved?\nKLEIN: Life is full of mysteries.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR That’s why life is so much fun.\nKLEIN: Anyone would think you didn’t want me in your TARDIS, for\nKLEIN: some reason.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And could they blame me?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 58 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 18: UPSTAIRS HALL\nKLEIN: (FX: LUCY IS STAGGERING ALONG THE HALL, FOOTSETEPS UNEVEN.\nSHE: STUMBLES AND HITS THE WALL.

I’d be worried, if I actually cared.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR After all, what are the odds of you being here just as an alien creature is discovered?\nKLEIN: It works both ways, you know. With the whole of infinity and eternity to choose from, what are the odds of you turning up at the same place and time as me?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Actually, given the way my life works, the odds are pretty good.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR What’s that?\nKLEIN: (CALLS) Come out with your hands up. I’ve got a gun and I’m not afraid to use it.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (TO HIMSELF) In fact, she’d rather enjoy it.\nJOSHUA: (AFRICAN, HEAVILY ACCENTED) Please, my name is Joshua.\nJOSHUA: Joshua Sembeke. You have to hide me from the Kitayaga.\nKLEIN: The who?\nJOSHUA: You call them the Mau Mau.\nJOSHUA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 60 of 133\nDOCTOR: Why are you running from them?\nJOSHUA: I disagree with what they are trying to do, so they call me ‘white’, like you.\nKLEIN: Do you know where they are? What their plans are?\nJOSHUA: I can tell you everything.\nKLEIN: (TO THE DOCTOR) I don’t trust him.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (TO KLEIN) You don’t trust anyone.\nKLEIN: And you trust everyone. Guess which one of us gets disappointed the most.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (TO JOSHUA) lLet’s get you back to the house and hear your story.

Or he could be exactly what he says.\nSYLVIA: We should lock him up.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 63 of 133\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR We should talk to him. Establish the truth.\nSYLVIA: (TO JOSHUA, IMPERIOUSLY, LIKE A MASTER TO A SERVANT) You there! Boy! How far away are the Mau Mau?\nJOSHUA: They’re still in Nairobi. There are a lot of houses to search and to take over before they come out here.\nSYLVIA: But they will, won’t they? Eventually?\nJOSHUA: Eventually they will be everywhere. They want to take Kenya back for the tribes. For the Kikuyu, the Embu and the Maru. They say it is their land, promised to them by the god Ngai, who lives at the top of the mountain Kirinyaga.\nSYLVIA: Where’s Denise?\nKLEIN: She’s dead.\nSYLVIA: (OVER FX. FURIOUS) You murderous savage!\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Mrs O’Donnell, stop! Joshua had nothing to do with it!\nKLEIN: It’s true. We were between him and where I found Denise’s body. He couldn’t have diverted around us without us seeing him.\nSYLVIA: (FURIOUS) Then it was his friends.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 64 of 133\nKLEIN: We didn’t see any friends.\nSYLVIA: (SUDDENLY REALISING WHAT HAS HAPPENED) Oh Denise! Poor Denise. (BEAT) How did she... How did it happen?\nKLEIN: Just like Christine.\nSYLVIA: Did you bring her back?\nKLEIN: I couldn’t... carry the body. Not in the state it was in.\nSYLVIA: We can’t just leave her out there.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I’1l go.\nJOSHUA: I can help. Please.\nJOSHUA: THE DOCTOR We’1l1 both go.\nKLEIN: Where’s Lucy?\nSYLVIA: Oh, I almost forgot. I found her collapsed on the landing upstairs. She was burning up. I got her into bed and I was just about to come looking for you when the Doctor returned with this... this native.\nKLEIN: T’11 take a look at her.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 65 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 21: LUCY’S BEDROOM\nKLEIN: Lucy?\nLUCY: (MOANS) Elizabeth?\nKLEIN: How are you feeling?\nLUCY: Woozy. Like I’ve had too much champagne. And my ears are all stuffed up. You sound like you’re a million miles away.\nKLEIN: I’m right here.\nLUCY: I think I must be hallucinating. I thought I heard a man’s voice. Not the Doctor, but a native.\nKLEIN: You weren’t hallucinating. We found a man outside. He claims to be a farm worker on the run from the Mau Mau.\nLUCY: What’s his name?\nKLEIN: He calls himself Joseph Sembeke. The jury is still out on whether he’s telling the truth or not. (BEAT) Here, let me feel your forehead. (BEAT) You’ve still got a temperature.\nKLEIN: And that rash is more pronounced than it was before. Do you need some aspirin?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 66 of 133\nLUCY: No - my head doesn’t hurt.\nKLEIN: What about some tranquillizers to help you sleep?\nLUCY: The problem isn’t sleeping - it’s staying awake.\nKLEIN: Well try dozing for a while. Let your body fight against whatever this infection is. I’1ll1 come back later and take\nKLEIN: some blood for testing, if that’s alright.\nLUCY: (SLEEPY) Whatever you think best. I trust you.\nKLEIN: (TO HERSELF) I’m glad someone does.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 67 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 22: THE KITCHEN\nSYLVIA: (BABBLING SLIGHTLY) It’s getting dark. I suppose I ought to be cooking dinner, but I’m not sure where to start. Denise and Lucy usually managed that sort of thing. Does one break eggs to make an omelette? I seem to remember there’s a saying about not being able to make an omelette without breaking eggs, but that’s really not much to go on when you’re looking for a recipe.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Ah, the English upper classes. Unable to do anything without help, but still convinced they’re superior to everyone els\nSYLVIA: You can criticize, Doctor, but just look at what we’ve achieved. We’re a small island with a small population, and yet we’ve made our mark around the world. We didn’t do it by force, by and large. We did it by civilizing, and educating, and showing small tribes whose vision went just as far as the horizon that by working together they could form a nation that could stretch from coast to coast.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Which you would rule.\nSYLVIA: If not us, then who? Joshua over there? If we leave th natives to run their own affairs then they will fail. They don’t have the skills or the background. Perhaps in three\nSYLVIA: or four generations they will be ready, but not now.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Yes, my people had a similar philosophy, for a while. Until it all went wrong.\nSYLVIA: (SNIDE) Your people? Yes, I thought there was something... foreign about you.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: “Foreign”, or “non-Aryan”? You need to be careful, Mrs O'Donnell. Your roots are showing.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 68 of 133\nJOSHUA: I can see something!\nJOSHUA: THE DOCTOR What is it?\nJOSHUA: Through the gaps in this shutter. I think I can see a\nJOSHUA: fire.\nSYLVIA: Let me see. It’s probably just the sunset.\nSYLVIA: He’s right. There’s something on fire, just over the horizon. I can see the glow against the clouds.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: I think it might be the farm next door.\nSYLVIA: I thnk you’re right. (BEAT) Denise would know. Poor Denise.\nJOSHUA: The Mau Mau are coming. This place will be next.\nSYLVIA: (ANGRY) I thought you said they were still in Nairobi!\nJOSHUA: I was wrong.\nSYLVIA: We need to get out. Damn. Damn. I was hoping we’d be safe here until this tawdry little business was over, but we need to move on.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR DO you have transport?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 69 of 133\nSYLVIA: There’s a Land Rover in the garage. It’s still working - Elizabeth checked. And there’s the Mercedes that we arrived in, but the journey was rough and I’m not sure about the suspension.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR TI’1ll go and tell Doctor Klein.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 70 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 23: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: (FX: SOUND OF GLASSWARE - A LIQUID BEING STIRRED BY A GLASS STIRRER)\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR I see the patient is awake.\nKLEIN: One of them. Lucy is still dozing. I’m just testing her blood now.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Anything?\nKLEIN: Nothing that’s within my abilities. (BITTERLY) I came here with a full medical laboratory, ready to test any disease and synthesize a vaccine, but I had to leave it all in Nairobi when this Mau Mau thing started. It’s probably all smashed and burned by now.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Is that... Denise Waterford’s body over there, under that sheet?\nKLEIN: It is. Thank you for bringing it back.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Don’t thank me. Joshua did most of the work.\nKLEIN: I’ve been performing a rough autopsy. A thorough examination of her injuries. I’m not convinced that the\nKLEIN: scratches killed her.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Not deep enough.\nKLEIN: You came to the same conclusion?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 71 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Via a less analytical route, perhaps, but yes. Could the shock of the attack have stopped her heart?\nKLEIN: Shock is overrated when it comes to cause of death, and besides, Denise was in good, robust health. No, I’m tending towards a toxin.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (SURPRISED) Poison?\nKLEIN: Take a look at this.\nKLEIN: Look at that scratch. Just there.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR The edges are inflamed.\nKLEIN: And they’re raised, as if there’s been some kind of allergic reaction. The same is true of most of the wounds.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Why didn’t we spot this with the previous body?\nKLEIN: Christine had lain in her room for several hours before Denise discovered her. The early stages of decomposition had begun. Any signs of inflammation or histamine reaction had faded.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And what about Abraham over there? How is it that he has escaped death?\nKLEIN: That is the sixty five million Deutschmark question, isn’t it? I did examine his wounds, and there’s no trace of any biological reaction.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 72 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR So either he was scratched but not poisoned...\nKLEIN: Or he has immunity to the poison.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Either way, we have a mystery.\nKLEIN: (DRYLY) I thought mysteries were what made life fun.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Not when your life may depend upon them.\nKLEIN: And did you come up here just to be cryptic, or was there something else?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Joshua saw a conflagration on the horizon. Sylvia suspects it’s the farm next door, set ablaze. She thinks we should get out of this place.\nKLEIN: With one invalid human, one suspected invalid alien and a possible Mau Mau collaborator?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Yes, I do see the problems, but consider the alternative. Do we really want to be here when the Mau Mau arrive?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 73 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 24: LUCY’S BEDROOM\nKLEIN: (FX: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH THE BED - SLOW, ATTEMPTING NOT TO BE HEARD. A BOARD CREAKS)\nJOSHUA: Do not be afraid.\nLUCY: Who are you?\nJOSHUA: My name is Joshua Sembeke. I am of the Kamba tribe. I was a worker on a farm nearby, until the Mau Mau came. Now I am hiding from them, as you are.\nLUCY: So what are you doing in my bedroom?\nJOSHUA: I heard a noise.\nLUCY: In my bedroom?\nJOSHUA: Upstairs.\nLUCY: This is upstairs. Oh, you mean in the attic. What kind of noise?\nJOSHUA: Like nothing I have heard before.\nLUCY: Well let’s go and take a look.\nLUCY: (FX: LUCY THROWS OFF HER BEDSHEET AND GETS OUT OF BED. SHE AND JOSHUA MOVE OVER TOWARDS THE DOOR AND INTO THE HALL)\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 74 of 133\nJOSHUA: Stop.\nLUCY: I can’t hear anything.\nJOSHUA: Let your mind and your heart become still. Listen without moving.\nLUCY: I still can’t hear anything.\nLUCY: JOSHUA. Perhaps further down.\nJOSHUA: Stop here.\nJOSHUA: (SILENCE FOR A MOMENT, THEN A FAINT FLUTTERING, LIKE A\nTHOUSAND: TINY WINGS, AS IF A FLOCK OF SPARROWS WAS CIRCLING AROUND THE ATTIC)\nLUCY: There!

He’s a liability.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR If you were wounded should we leave you behind?\nKLEIN: Of course. The needs of the individual are nothing compared to the needs of the group.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (EXASPERATED) What is a group if it’s not made up of individuals? Everyone matters, Klein. Nobody is unimportant.\nKLEIN: You are risking all of our lives, Doctor, fora meaninglessly sentimental gesture. (BEAT) We should wrap him in a blanket. It would make him easier to carry.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR He’s amazingly thin. Almost malnourished.\nKLEIN: The blood loss hasn’t helped. I don’t even know whether putting him on a saline drip would be helpful or fatal.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Test the PH of his blood. That might give us some idea of his basic biochemistry.\nLUCY: Elizabeth?\nKLEIN: Lucy! I thought you were asleep!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 76 of 133\nLUCY: I was woken up. Doctor, there’s something in the attic.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR What kind of something?\nLUCY: Like Denise heard before, in Christine’s room. A kind of fluttering, like a trapped bird.\nKLEIN: A bird? Is that where that feather came from? Some kind of bird?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (MUSES) Intelligent avian species are remarkably rare in the cosmos. Something to do with their inability to manipulate tools effectively with their wings, I think.\nKLEIN: How do you know it’s intelligent?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Because it’s here, on Earth.\nLUCY: But what do we do about it?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: Under other circumstances I’d like to attempt to communicate with it, but I think the general consensus of opinion is that we ought to evacuate the house.\nLUCY: Evacuate? To where?\nKLEIN: To anywhere that the Mau Mau aren’t.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: We need to get Abraham here downstairs to the garage. Sylvia’s getting the car started. I need you and Joshua to pack as much food as you can to take with us.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 77 of 133\nLUCY: All right.\nKLEIN: But before you do that I want to give you some vitamins and some antibiotics. I’m still worried about that rash.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 78 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 26: THE GARAGE\nKLEIN: (FX: A LAND ROVER ENGINE TURNING OVER ONCE, TWICE, AND THEN SPLUTTERING TO A HALT)\nSYLVIA: (CLOSE) Damn !\nSYLVIA: (FX: AGAIN, SHE TURNS THE KEY AND THE ENGINE FAILS TO CATCH)\nKLEIN: The Doctor said you wanted to evacuate the house.\nSYLVIA: I think it’s our only option, but I can’t get the engine started.\nKLEIN: I’ve got Lucy down, and the Doctor is bringing Abraham and Joshua.\nSYLVIA: Why on Earth are we taking them?\nKLEIN: The Doctor was very insistent.\nSYLVIA: Yes, he does have that tendency, doesn’t he? Still, I suppose if he’s with the Foreign Office then he must know best.\nLUCY: Excuse me! Coming through!\nSYLVIA: Lucy, my dear, how are you feeling?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who —- A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 79 of 133\nLUCY: Much better now that I’ve had a nap, thank you. I’ve packed a picnic basket with as much food as I could manage.\nSYLVIA: Shove it in the back, and climb in behind me. (BEAT) Elizabeth, get the creature and the native boy in the back, but make sure they can’t reach the guns.\nKLEIN: Understood. Do you want me to drive?\nSYLVIA: I was rather expecting the Doctor to drive, as he’s the closest thing we have to a man of the house.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I’d be more than happy. I have happy memories of big green Land Rovers.\nSYLVIA: (FX: THE KEY TURNS AGAIN AND THE ENGINE ROARS TRIUMPHANTLY INTO LIFE)\nSYLVIA: How did you do that?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR As with dogs, the trick is not making the engine think you’re afraid of it. (CALLS CHEERILY) All aboard who’s\nSYLVIA: coming aboard!\nSYLVIA: (FX: GEARS CLASH AND THE ENGINE ROARS AS THE DOCTOR SORTS\nHIMSELF: OUT)\nHIMSELF: THE DOCTOR (TO HIMSELF) Ah, yes, no temporal synchromesh. Must remember.\nHIMSELF: (FX: AND THEY’RE OFF! ENGINE NOISE AND TYRE SQUEAL AS THEY DRIVE)\nLUCY: Oh... Not so fast!\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 80 of 133\nLUCY: (FX: CHANGE IN SOUND OF DRIVING AS THE LANDROVER GETS ONTO THE GRAVEL ROAD)\nLUCY: (FX: SOUND OF LEAVES AND TWIGS SLAPPING AGAINST THE BUMPER AND THE SIDES OF THE WINDOWS)\nKLEIN: When was this road last cleared, for heaven’s sake?\nSYLVIA: The trouble is that the jungle grows so fast that you’ve no sooner finished cutting than you have to start again.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Oh - you cut it yourself, Mrs O’Donnell?\nSYLVIA: Of course not. We have natives to do it for us.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR How exhausting for you.\nSYLVIA: I must say that I admire a man who insists on driving on the left, even under these circumstances.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Did you know that eighty six per cent of all species drive on the left, and nobody knows why.\nLUCY: Did he say ‘species’?\nKLEIN: He meant ‘nationalities’.\nSYLVIA: Well in that case they drive on the lert because we do.\nKLEIN: We’re coming up on a bend. The gate should be straight ahead once we get round it.\nKLEIN: (FX: THE DOCTOR CHANGES GEAR AND SLOWS DOWN TO NEGOTIATE THE BEND, THEN SPEEDS UP)\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 81 of 133\nSYLVIA: Damn it! Did we leave the gate closed when we came through?\nKLEIN: It doesn’t matter. Stop and let me out.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR It appears we have been anticipated.\nLUCY: What 2S .b 2\nSYLVIA: There’s something in front of the gates.\nKLEIN: Two burned out cars and a tree trunk, blocking the way.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Too heavy to shift.\nJOSHUA: The Mau Mau do not want you to leave.\nJOSHUA: THE DOCTOR Apparently so.\nSYLVIA: I can’t see any natives.\nKLEIN: (GRIM) They’ve probably dumped the stuff there to pin us down and then gone back to whatever pillaging they were doing down the road. They’1ll come for us when they are ready.\nLUCY: Can’t we just drive along the boundary fence until we find somewhere that we can cut through?\nSYLVIA: The fence is chain link, and the trees and bushes go right up to it. We’d get five yards into the jungle and get stuck.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 82 of 133\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: (SOFTLY) We’ll have to go back to the house. Fortify it. Barricade ourselves in. But first... (LOUDER) Doctor Klein, please pass me one of those shotguns. I think I’ve got some twine in my pocket. I’d be surprised if I don’t, considering what else is in there.\nKLEIN: I got the impression last time we met that you didn’t like guns.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I don’t like weapons. People can use almost anything as a weapon -— a car battery, a fountain pen, an umbrella. Fortunately it’s sometimes possible to use a weapon as something entirely different.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 83 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 27: THE SITTING ROOM\nKLEIN: (FX: THE RADIO IS ON, QUETLY, PLAYING SOME INNOCUOUS DANCE\nKLEIN: TO IT)\nSYLVIA: There, that’s nearly done it. Nothing’s getting in through this window now. (BEAT) I never realized before how\nSYLVIA: exhilarating hard work can be.\nKLEIN: (INTENSELY) I think I hate the BBC World Service. I swear that if the world is ever incinerated in a superpower nuclear conflagration, they’1ll still be transmitting a programme of light classics and recipes to an audience consisting entirely of mutated cockroaches.\nSYLVIA: And they never play Wagner. Have you noticed that?\nKLEIN: Oh, I’ve noticed. Imperialism by stealth, that’s what it is. Light classics are the opium of the masses.\nSYLVIA: (CAREFULLY) I sometimes wonder if something ought to be done about it.\nKLEIN: Such as?\nSYLVIA: The right people, taking the right jobs. Politicians, broadcasters, industrialists. All with the same... core set of beliefs that there are better forms of government\nSYLVIA: than the so-called democracy we have, which is pretty much a choice between a handful of parties none of which you would trust to run the country.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 84 of 133\nKLEIN: (QUIETLY) The tragedy of National Socialism is that the concept of a benevolent dictator has lost all credibility.\nSYLVIA: (EQUALLY QUIETLY) Whereas it’s palpably the best form of government.\nKLEIN: If you choose the right dictator.\nSYLVIA: That’s the trick, isn’t it? (BEAT) I do still have a number of friends in the higher echelons of British society. We keep in touch.\nKLEIN: And I have some friends in South America who would like to\nKLEIN: meet them.\nSYLVIA: (SUDDENLY BACK TO REALITY) If we ever get out of here alive.\nKLEIN: What the hell was that?\nSYLVIA: Shotgun.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Warning signal. I left the shotgun tied to a tree by the gate, with the trigger attached to a piece of twine stretched across the road.\nKLEIN: I hope you had the shotgun pointing across the road as well.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 85 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Of course not. I left it pointed upwards. I wanted warning, not bloodshed.\nKLEIN: How very humanitarian.\nKLEIN: (FX: A RIFLE SHOT, IN THE DISTANCE. A SECOND LATER, WE HEAR THE BULLET HIT THE STONEWORK OF THE HOUSE\nKLEIN: They’ve lost the element of surprise.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Fired from about between the shot\nKLEIN: half a mile away, judging by the lag and the bullet hitting.\nKLEIN: ct ct\nSYLVIA: (URGENTLY) What do we do?\nKLEIN: We fire back of course. Defend ourselves.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I abhor violence.\nKLEIN: Violence doesn’t care about your opinions, Doctor - it just ise,\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Violence begets violence.\nSYLVIA: A damn Conscientious Objector. I should have know.\nSYLVIA: (FX: A THIRD SHOT, FOLLOWED BY BREAKING GLASS SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE)\nSYLVIA: We’1ll go up to my bedroom. It overlooks the drive.\nKLEIN: What about the back of the house? They might sneak around.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 86 of 133\nSYLVIA: Doctor, would it injure your precious principles to keep lookout from Lucy’s bedroom at the back, and call us if you see anything?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I’1l take Lucy and Joshua with me.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 87 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 28: SYLVIA’S BEDROOM\nKLEIN: You take the right hand window; I’1ll take the left.\nSYLVIA: We’ll have to push the shutters open. That’1l be noticed.\nKLEIN: Well, you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.\nSYLVIA: That’s the second time today I’ve been reminded of that.\nSYLVIA: (FX: SOUND OF TWO SETS OF STORM SHUTTERS BEING PUSHED OPEN.\nPERHAPS: FAINT JUNGLE NOISES IN THE DISTANCE)\nPERHAPS: (FX: A SHOT, LOUDER NOW THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN. A BULLET\nSMACKS: INTO THE WALL OUTSIDE)\nSYLVIA: Can you see them?\nKLEIN: I thought I saw something move in the treeline. (BEAT) There!\nSYLVIA: You got him!\nKLEIN: (GRIM) I got something.\nKLEIN: (FX: ANOTHER SHOT FROM THE TREES. BREAKING GLASS INSIDE\nTHE ROOM: A MIRROR OR FRAMED PICTURE)\nSYLVIA: They’ re getting better.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 88 of 133\nKLEIN: Just as long as we stay better than them. (BEAT) Over by the hen house!\nSYLVIA: I see him.\nKLEIN: Oh, good shot!\nSYLVIA: Thank you. I used to be rather good on the moors in grouse season.\nKLEIN: IT’1l bet you were.\nSYLVIA: We didn’t get all of them.\nKLEIN: That was a handgun. They might be out of rifles. Or riflemen.\nSYLVIA: What’s that, over by the baobab tree?\nKLEIN: I don’t... Oh yes. Just to the left. Yes, and he’s got a pistol as well. (BEAT) (MURMURS) Come on, just forward a little, just so I can make out your face.\nKLEIN: And that’s the third.\nSYLVIA: Is that it?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who —- A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 89 of 133\nKLEIN: Maybe. Maybe it’s not a full Mau Mau attack. Maybe it’s just a small band of looters taking advantage of the confusion.\nSYLVIA: The Mau Mau are just a band of looters. Don’t dignify them by making them out to be anything else. (BEAT) We should wait for a while, just to be sure.\nKLEIN: I’1ll watch everything to the left of the road; you watch to the right. We’1ll give it ten minutes.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 90 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 29: DINING ROOM\nKLEIN: (FX: THE SOUND OF SOMEONE TRYING TO TUNE IN A RADIO. THERE IS ONLY STATIC, AND THE OCCASIONAL SOUND OF A GHOSTLY MORSE\nSIGNAL: DRIFTING ACROSS THE AIRWAVES LIKE THE CRY OF A SEAGULL)\nLUCY: It’s no use. I can’t find the BBC World Service.\nSYLVIA: Wherever the transmitters are, they’ve probably been smashed.\nLUCY: But where are we going to get the news from now?\nSYLVIA: (GRIM) If the BBC’s transmitters have been smashed then that’s all the news we need. We’re on our own.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR (MUSING) We always are, in the end.\nSYLVIA: Let’s take stock of our situation.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR It’s been quiet for the past hour or so. Doctor Klein is upstairs with Abraham.\nSYLVIA: Tsh! I do wish people wouldn’t personalize that creature SO.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Lack of personalization is probably one of the reasons the Mau Mau rebelled in the first place.\nSYLVIA: What about the native boy. Where is he?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR You mean Joshua? I asked him to check the shutters in every room.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 91 of 133\nSYLVIA: And you trust him to do that?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: I’ll check them myself after he comes back. If they’re all still intact, we know we can trust him.\nSYLVIA: If they’re damaged or open, we know we can’t trust him. If they’ re undamaged, the jury is still out.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: You can prove a positive, but you can never prove a negative. How surprisingly philosophical.\nSYLVIA: I went to Oxford, Doctor. I’m not stupid.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: You are many things, Mrs O’Donnell, but I don’t believe that stupid is one of them.\nLUCY: (SUDDENLY) Please, don’t bicker! I can’t stand it!\nSYLVIA: I’m sorry, my dear. (BEAT) You’re right - we need to work\nSYLVIA: together if we are going to survive this.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 92 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 30: A BEDROOM\nKLEIN: If you’re asking what I’m doing, I’m testing your blood.\nKLEIN: Because the Doctor has an over-ridingly altruistic desire to help you.\nKLEIN: (TALKING WHILE SHE’S WORKING) I’m trying to find out if your blood is anything at all like ours. It’s the same colour, and the clotting factor looks to be similar. I\nKLEIN: wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s haemoglobin-based yet, but it’s certainly got the same PH as human blood, which raises some interesting questions about convergent evolution that I’ll have to take up with the Doctor. I might be able to risk putting you on a saline drip to try and get some fluids into you, although I’d be nervous about the effects of a transfusion.\nKLEIN: (FX: SOUND OF KLEIN MOVING ACROSS THE ROOM. A SHEET IS\nPULLED: OFF AN OBJECT)\nKLEIN: Yes, this is Christine O’Donnell. Or it was. And suspect you know what killed her, although you can’ us, even if you wanted to. But I intend finding out.\nKLEIN: =\nKLEIN: tell\nKLEIN: ct ct\nABRAHAM: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 93 of 133\nKLEIN: By trying to purify whatever toxin killed her. If I’m going to be able to identify it, I need to collect a large enough sample before it degrades. (SHE’S THINKING HER WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AS SHE TALKS) There’s a small amount of toxin in the blisters around each wound, but there are a lot of wounds, so I should be able to build up a good few millilitres if I can find a needle thin enough, and if my hand is steady enough.\nKLEIN: (SARCASTIC) No, that’s all right. You just stay where you\nKLEIN: are. I can manage.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 94 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 31: DINING ROOM\nLUCY: We can’t leave the house, we don’t know if the British Army will ever come and rescue us, and if the Mau Mau don’t kill us all then this creature that slaughtered Denise and Christine will do it.\nSYLVIA: Yes, Doctor, what are we doing about keeping watch for the Mau Mau?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I went out earlier and set up a series of trip wires.\nSYLVIA: Not linked to shotguns I hope. We may need all the ones we have.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR To cow bells. We’ll hear if anyone approaches along any of the paths through the jungle.\nSYLVIA: Very enterprising. And very brave. Thank you.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Oh, I can move like a cat if the mood takes me.\nSYLVIA: (FX: SUDDEN INARTICULATE YELL FROM UPSTAIRS. IT’S ABRAHAM.\nGLASS: SHATTERS UPSTAIRS AND A BODY HITS THE FLOOR)\nSYLVIA: What in Heaven’s name..?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR It’s Klein!\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 95 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 32: A BEDROOM\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS) Klein!\nLUCY: What’s the matter?\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR I don’t know. She’s collapsed.\nSYLVIA: And that damned creature has gone.\nLUCY: The window’s open! It got out that way!\nSYLVIA: I knew it!\nJOSHUA: What has happened?\nLUCY: It’s Doctor Klein. She’s dead!\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR No, she’s still alive! Look, there’s no blood, no scratches.\nSYLVIA: Except for that gash on her hand.\nLUCY: Elizabeth - what happened?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) I was... trying to collect a sample of toxin from Denise’s body. I’d got a syringe full, but Abraham attacked me from behind.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 96 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR What happened to the syringe, Klein?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) Broken. Scratched my hand.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (GRIMLY) And it looks as if the toxin splashed across the scratch. Whatever killed Mrs McCormack is now in your bloodstream!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 97 of 133\nKLEIN: EPISODE FOUR\nLUCY: Elizabeth -— what happened?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) I was... trying to collect a sample of toxin from Denise’s body. I’d got a syringe full, but Abraham attacked me from behind.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR What happened to the syringe, Klein?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) Broken. Scratched my hand.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (GRIMLY) And it looks as if the toxin splashed across the scratch. Whatever killed Mrs McCormack is now in your bloodstream!\nKLEIN: SCENE 33: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: (URGENTLY) Well don’t just stand there like a cauliflower, man — help her!\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Joshua -— check the windows in the other bedrooms. The last thing we need is the Mau Mau attacking now. Lucy, I’11l need hot water in a bowl\nJOSHUA: I will shout if I see anything.\nJOSHUA: THE DOCTOR Mrs O’Donnell, help me get Doctor Klein onto the bed.\nJOSHUA: (FX: SOUNDS OF TWO PEOPLE LIFTING A THIRD PERSON ONTO A BED)\nJOSHUA: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 98 of 133\nJOSHUA: THE DOCTOR How are you feeling, Klein?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) Hot. Nauseous. And my hand feels as if it’s swelling up like a balloon.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR We need to stop the poison getting any further into your body. Mrs O’Donnell, hand me that sheet.\nSYLVIA: What are you doing?\nKLEIN: He’s making a tourniquet.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR If I cut off the blood supply just below the elbow it’1l stop the toxin from circulating.\nKLEIN: What if it’s already got into my system?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR One thing at a time.\nLUCY: I’ve got the water.\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR Well done. Now go and help Joshua check the windows for signs of activity outside.\nSYLVIA: And take this gun.\nLUCY: In case the Mau Mau attack?\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 99 of 133\nSYLVIA: In case Joshua isn’t what he says he is.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: (DISTRACTED) Mrs O’Donnell - you wash the scratch thoroughly with the remains of that sheet. Keep changing the material - we don’t want to keep reintroducing the poison back into the wound.\nSYLVIA: And what about you?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR I’m going to see what’s in Doctor Klein’s medical bag.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 100 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 34: THE RAINFOREST\nSYLVIA: (FX: SOMEONE PUSHING THEIR WAY THROUGH VINES, LEAVES, BRANCHES)\nSYLVIA: (FX: HEAVY BREATHING AND GUTTERAL NOISES.

Wouldn’t it make life easier for you if I were absent from\nKLEIN: your universe?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Not like this.\nSYLVIA: What are you two on about?\nKLEIN: The Doctor and I have what you might call a conflict of ideologies.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Doctor Klein’s ideology is that you have to break something down to rubble before you can build it up again the way you want. I’m much more of the opinion that you can build in whatever direction you want using wherever you are as your foundation.\nSYLVIA: (DISMISSIVE) Yes, that’s why London is a rabbit-warren of winding streets and alleys in all conceivable historical styles whereas Berlin had the most magnificently balanced architecture set in wide open public spaces, all designed in the same manner by Albert Speer.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Ah, yes. This should slow your metabolism down a tad. Intravenous, I think. (BEAT) So if our positions were reversed, Klein - if I were dying, and you knew I would try\nSYLVIA: to change your world if I survived - would you help me?\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) If I thought you might succeed, then no. The world would be better off with you dead.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 102 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: And how would that be any different from just putting a pillow over my face and suffocating me, or injecting me with insulin and watching me die?\nKLEIN: It wouldn’t, of course.\nSYLVIA: Oh for heaven’s sake, you two. This is academic. We’re all civilized people. We help one another despite the fact that our beliefs might be at odds.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR (TO KLEIN) Make a fist. That’s right. Just a little scratch. (BEAT) (TO SYLVIA) There’s hope for you yet,\nSYLVIA: Mrs O’Donnell.\nKLEIN: You realize that you’re just staving off the inevitable?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR By keeping you alive? I will never let you change history the way you want to.\nKLEIN: I mean by using the tourniquet and the drugs. The toxin is still in my system.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (GRIMLY) I know.\nSYLVIA: So what are you going to do about it?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: The only thing I can. I’m going after Abraham. If there’s an anti-toxin for this poison then he’s the only hope we have of finding it. He’s the key to this whole situation.\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 103 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 36: THE RAINFOREST\nSYLVIA: (FX: ABRAHAM PUSHING THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH AND GRUNTING, AS BEFORE)\nSYLVIA: (FX: SUDDENLY ABRAHAM FALLS TO THE SOFT GROUND, GRUNTING\nHEAVILY: AS HE HITS)\nHEAVILY: (FX: ABRAHAM CLIMBS BACK TO HIS FEET AND STARTS RUNNING AGAIN)\nHEAVILY: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 104 of 133\nHEAVILY: SCENE 37: A BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: You’re going out alone into a jungle filled with Mau Mau\nSYLVIA: infiltrators and some kind of ferocious beast. And you’re in search of a creature that’s on the run who can’t tell\nSYLVIA: you what it is that you want to know anyway.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR (RELUCTANTLY) Yes...\nSYLVIA: Then I’m coming with you.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR And leave two invalids guarding the house? I think not. I need you to stay here.\nKLEIN: Then I need to come with you.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You can hardly move.\nKLEIN: If you succeed in finding an anti-toxin then you need to get it into me as fast as possible. By the time you get back to the house, I might be dead.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (WITH BAD GRACE) Oh very well. Have it your own way. You usually do.\nLUCY: (DISTANT) Doctor, I can hear a cowbell. I think the Mau Mau are coming!\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR (CALLS) It’s more likely to be Abraham running in the opposite direction. Where did the noise come from?\nLUCY: (DISTANT) The far side of the house. Out past the hen houses.\nLUCY: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 105 of 133\nLUCY: THE DOCTOR\nLUCY: Which is more or less in the opposite direction from the gate. Well, at least that tells us what direction to head one Hea ouree ser\nLUCY: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 106 of 133\nLUCY: SCENE 38: THE RAINFOREST\nLUCY: (FX: APPROACHING SOUNDS OF TWO PEOPLE CUTTING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEAVES AND BRANCHES. ONE IS USING A MACHETE, THE OTHER IS USING AN UMBRELLA)\nKLEIN: (WEAKLY) Wouldn’t you be better off using a machete?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR No, I’m fine with the umbrella, thank you. It’s a multi- purpose instrument.\nKLEIN: Are you sure he came this way?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I’1ll have you know that I learned my tracking skills from the proud hunters of the Arapaho tribe.\nKLEIN: Whos xpertise lay in hunting buffalo across the American plains, I believe. I’m not reassured.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (HUFFILY) The principles are the same.\nKLEIN: If we end up finding a buffalo instead of that alien creature, I’ll make you eat those words. (BEAT) If I last that long.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: How are you doing?\nKLEIN: I can’t walk in a straight line and I can’t feel my left arm. But on the good side, I’m not feeling any more nauseous than I did back at the house. Whatever you did appears to have worked.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Only a temporary solution, I’m afraid.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 107 of 133\nKLEIN: There’s always... (RELUCTANTLY) amputation, I suppose.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: That’s your answer to everything isn’t it? Just destroy the source of the problem and move on. Carpet-bombing native tribes, cutting away poisoned flesh, deleting whole swathes of history... Don’t you have any subtlety Klein?\nKLEIN: Do what works: that’s my motto. Morality is a luxury.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR There are many ways of getting to the same destination, and often the best one is not the most direct.\nKLEIN: A bit like your tracking skills...\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 108 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 39: SYLVIA’S BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: (CALLS) Lucy? Are you there?\nLUCY: (DISTANT) Still here.\nSYLVIA: (CALLS) Any signs of life?\nLUCY: (DISTANT) Nothing on this side of the house.\nSYLVIA: (CALLS) How are you holding up?\nLUCY: (DISTANT) Actually, I’m not doing too well. My head feels kind-of swimmy.\nSYLVIA: (CALLS) Keep your chin up, dear. The Doctor will be back soon. (BEAT) (CALLS) Boy? Where are you? (BEAT) Joshua? Can you hear me? (BEAT) Lucy, have you seen\nSYLVIA: Joshua? Is he with you?\nSYLVIA: Lucy? Is that you? (BEAT) (FRIGHTENED NOW) Anyone?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 109 of 133\nSYLVIA: SCENE 40: THE RAINFOREST\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Look — traces of blood on that tree trunk. Abraham’s been this way.\nKLEIN: (BREATHLESS) Which tree trunk? I can see two.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR The one I’m pointing to.\nKLEIN: But I can see two of you.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Is this your way of telling me that you’re experiencing some visual disturbances?\nKLEIN: I knew you’d get there in the end. (BEAT) You could just abandon me, you know. I’m sure your TARDIS isn’t too far away. Just go. Leave me to my fate.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And what about Sylvia and Lucy? Should I just abandon them as well?\nKLEIN: Why not? Aren’t they already a part of this history that you’re trying so hard to protect? The Allies won the war, and a group of women were massacred in the Mau Mau rebellion. Why is it that you feel the need to preserve one and change the other?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (SIGHS) Small stones and big rocks.\nKLEIN: You’ve lost me.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 110 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: History is like a huge pile of stones and rocks. You can take the stones out from between the rocks and not disturb the pile, but start taking the rocks out half-way up and there’s a landslide.\nKLEIN: So the small, personal events are the stones and the big historical ones are the rocks.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Something like that.\nKLEIN: It sounds more like a children’s game. You know, taking the wooden blocks out of a tower without it falling down.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: And there are some races in the universe who treat history just like that. As a game for their children to play. (BEAT) Come on, let’s keep going.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 111 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 41: LUCY’S BEDROOM\nSYLVIA: (URGENTLY) Lucy? Oh my dear! What happened?\nLUCY: (INCOHERENTLY) Fell down. Feeling dizzy. Think I might be sick.\nSYLVIA: Here, let’s get you into bed. (BEAT) That rash is all over your face.\nLUCY: Sorry Mrs O’Donnell. Should be on watch. Must...\nSYLVIA: (FIRMLY) No. You stay where you are. I’11 go and get the boy to help.\nSYLVIA: Joshua? (BEAT) What are you doing?\nJOSHUA: I am watching for the Mau Mau.\nSYLVIA: What do you need that torch for?\nJOSHUA: (HESITATES) It will be dark soon.\nSYLVIA: But not yet, and you’ve got it switched on. (BEAT) You’re\nSYLVIA: Signaling them, aren’t you? You’re signaling the Mau Mau!\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 112 of 133\nJOSHUA: (MENACING NOW) And they will come, and they will kill you!\nSYLVIA: (DESPATRING) But why? What have we ever done to you?\nJOSHUA: You took our lands and forced us to work for you for a pittance, and still you ask us that? How stupid are you?\nSYLVIA: (SHOUTS) Doctor! Help!\nJOSHUA: The funny little man cannot help you now.\nSYLVIA: Stay away from me?\nSYLVIA: Stay away!\nSYLVIA: (FX: SYLVIA’S FOOTSTEPS AS SHE RUNS. JOSHUA’S LUMBERING\nFOOTSTEPS: AS HE CHASES)\nSYLVIA: (GASPING) Oh, please, no, no!\nSYLVIA: (FX: SYLVIA GASPING AS THE BREATH IS DRIVEN OUT OF HER BODY)\nJOSHUA: And now you will pay for everything you have done.\nJOSHUA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 113 of 133\nJOSHUA: SCENE 42: THE RAINFOREST\nKLEIN: What’s that?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Where?\nKLEIN: Through the trees.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I can’t see anything. You must be hallucinating.\nKLEIN: No, over there.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Ah. Yes, it’s Abraham. He appears to have stopped running.\nKLEIN: He looks like he’s waiting for something. (BEAT) You know, I’m beginning to think that Denise was right about knitting him some clothes. There’s something rather disconcerting about him standing there, naked.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Let’s approach cautiously. Softly softly catchee alien.\nKLEIN: Abraham? It’s Doctor Klein and... (THINKS) and the Doctor. The Doctor. (BEAT) (WITH WONDER) What’s that thing he’s\nKLEIN: standing in front of?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Some kind of prefabricated structure. A dome.\nKLEIN: It’s looks like plastic.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 114 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Certainly artificial, and probably not from this planet. Look at how the colours shift.\nKLEIN: You could probably fit a couple of rooms in there.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I suspect there is more, underground. I wonder, did Abraham build it, or was it someone else.\nKLEIN: (FX: FLUTTERING, LIKE A MILLION SCRAPS OF PAPER DROPED IN FRONT OF A FAN, DISTANT AT FIRST BUT GETTING LOUDER. AND LOUDER)\nKLEIN: What the hell is that?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR It’s the last pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, assembling\nKLEIN: themselves into a picture.\nKLEIN: It’s birds! Hundreds of them! Thousands!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (INTRIGUED) A flock, moving as one.\nKLEIN: They’re attacking Abraham!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Quite the reverse. They’re settling on him. Covering him.\nKLEIN: (FX: THE FLUTTERING DIES AWAY. LET’S LEAVE IT WITH A\nBACKGROUND: RUSTLING, AS IF WINGS ARE SHIFTING AND SETTLING)\nKLEIN: He’s completely covered. It’s as if he’s clothed in feathers from head to foot.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Imagine all of those tiny claws, gripping his skin; all those tiny beaks pressing against his flesh.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 115 of 133\nKLEIN: Those scratches all over his body!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And on Denise’s body. And Christine’s.\nKLEIN: They were caused by a flock of birds? This flock of birds?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Birds with poisonous claws. Alien birds.\nKLEIN: Then why doesn’t their poison affect Abraham?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Oh, if he’s their mule then it wouldn’t make evolutionary sense for him to die every time they land on him.\nKLEIN: Their mule?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: How else would a flock of birds be able to manipulate tools and build spaceships except by using another creature? I imagine they use some form of short-range telepathy or thought-control. The birds are probably relatively mindless individually, but as a flock they have a group intelligence that can influence poor Abraham.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (TO THE BIRDS) I am the Doctor. Am I communicating with the bipedal mammal, or the avian flock?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: (MANY VOICES, WHISPERING) We are the Chaelis. We have been searching for the host. You had captured him. We sought to release him.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Hardly ‘captured’. He was found in the jungle, unconscious.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 116 of 133\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS (AFFRONTED, IF ALIEN BIRDS CAN SOUND AFFRONTED) We left him. When he returned, he was not there.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And does he always stay where you leave him?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS Of course. What else would he do?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Oh, I don’t know. Why don’t you ask him? He might want to do some sightseeing, or get an ice-cream. Or visit an art gallery.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS Your words make no sense. The host has no opinions, no thoughts of his own.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You might be surprised.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: You are not of this world, Doctor. We sense depths, chasms, abysses within you that these others do not contain.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Oh, I’m a traveler, just passing through. But what about you? What’s your motive for being here?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS We conduct research.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR But why here? Why this planet?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: The atmosphere matches our atmosphere. The insects can be eaten by us. The vegetation can be eaten by the host. It is... convenient.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You misunderstand me. Why go to another planet at all? Why not do your research on your own planet - assuming you\nKLEIN: still have one?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 117 of 133\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS Too dangerous!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (CONTEMPTUOUS) So you move the risk to a different world? Brave of you to actually do it yourself.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS Your words make no sense. We do what works. Morality is a luxury.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: And what is the subject of this dangerous research that you are doing, hidden away here in the jungle? Nuclear fusion? Anti-matter? Distronic radiation? (DARKER) Or is it biological warfare?\nKLEIN: Of course. Lucy’s illness was caused by an accidental leak. Something got out.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS This is true. The leak was stopped, but some microbes escaped.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (GETTING ANGRY) This is monstrous!\nKLEIN: Actually, looked at dispassionately, this is entirely practical.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (ANGRIER) But why use an occupied world? Why not base yourselves on a planet with vegetation and insects but no intelligent life?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: Of all the planets we surveyed, this one had the highest number of microbial organisms and the fastest rate of evolution. This planet is unique.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (FURIOUS) It’s also got a dominant life form —- humanity!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 118 of 133\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: Another advantage - the humans will form perfect test subjects for our research, once we have progressed that far. The accident has already proven that humans can become infected by our artificial microbes.\nKLEIN: But what’s the point in using humans as test subjects? That won’t tell you anything about the effects of disease on your own race.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Oh, I think their plans go well beyond their own race. I think they are trying to develop diseases that attack many races at once. A universal plague.\nKLEIN: How clever!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: How utterly appalling! And what are you going to do with these biological weapons, once you have them? Win wars? Take over solar systems? Become the biggest bully in the playground?\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: Warfare is a foolish past-time, wasteful of energy and resources. We will sell our weapons. Other species who are engaged in warfare will pay highly for microbes that could infect their enemies. We will become the most powerful economic entity in the galaxy, and when other races have wiped each other out or bankrupted themselves then we will control the galaxy.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And you will be immune to all these diseases, of course.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS\nKLEIN: (SMUGLY) We have developed a cure. Our microbes all contain a genetically engineered weakness, a biological trapdoor that can be exploited by a particular toxin.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR How perfect. How symmetrical. And how wholly, utterly wrong. You must be stopped. You will be stopped.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 119 of 133\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS Not by you.\nKLEIN: Be careful. I think they’re preparing to take off\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS You are disruptive. You must be silenced.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: (HURRIEDLY) I’m talking now to Abraham. To the host, not the Chaelis. Abraham, you don’t have to go along with this. You are a being in your own right. You have opinions, thoughts, beliefs and desires. (URGENTLY) You do not have to subjugate your will to that of the Chaelis.\nKLEIN: The Doctor is right. I know you are intelligent. You tried to hold a conversation with me. You were aware of\nKLEIN: what I was saying. And when you escaped from the house you demonstrated that you could make your own choices. Make one now! Resist the Chaelis!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR No creature should ever live under the domination of another. Exert your free will! Say “no, today I will not\nKLEIN: do what you want, I will do what I want”.\nABRAHAM: THE CHAELIS (CONCERNED) Brothers, our control over the host is\nABRAHAM: weakening. Concentrate!\nKLEIN: They’ re settling back on him!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: The shorter the range, the greater the control. (TO ABRAHAM) Stay strong! Focus on what you want, not what they want. (URGENTLY) You don’t want to hurt us! You don’t want to hurt anyone!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 120 of 133\nKLEIN: It’s not working!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR They’ re re-establishing control.\nABRAHAM: (INARTICUATE GRUNTING, BUT MORE URGENT, MORE FRENZIED.\nALMOST: FORMING WORDS)\nKLEIN: What’s he doing?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I don’t know.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS (FORCED, AGAINST THEIR WILL) “Just because something is... different doesn’t mean... that it is inferior.”\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Those are my words!\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS (FORCED) “What Sse Groupic. LESTE Ss mot made-up oF individuals? Everyone matters... Nobody is...\nKLEIN: unimportant.\nKLEIN: He’s remembering what we said in his presence.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS The Doctor has an over-ridingly altruistic desire to help people in distress.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And forcing the Chaelis to repeat it. He’s reversing the telepathic link!\nKLEIN: (FX: A SLAPPING SOUND, LIKE SOMEONE POUNDING ON A FEATHER PILLOW, AS ABRAHAM STARTS HITTING AT THE BIRDS WHICH COVER HIM)\nKLEIN: He’s hurting himself!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 121 of 133 THE DOCTOR No, he’s hitting out at the birds that cover him.\nKLEIN: He’s crushing them!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: And they’re turning on him, scratching deeper with their claws, their beaks and their feathers.\nKLEIN: THE CHAELIS (WEAKER, FEWER VOICES) No, stop! You must stop! Do as we command! (BEAT) You are killing us! You are killing us!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR There are too few of them left to exert control.\nKLEIN: They’re taking off - watch out!\nKLEIN: (FX: THE SOUND OF WINGS BEATING AS THE FEW REMAINING\nCHAELIS: TAKE OFF FROM ABRAHAM)\nCHAELIS: THE DOCTOR The gestalt consciousness has broken down. They’re individual now, instinctively reacting to a threat.\nKLEIN: And they’ve decided we’re part of the threat!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR We’ve no choice. Use your machete against them.\nKLEIN: What about you?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I have my umbrella. Look out, here they come!\nKLEIN: (FX: THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF AN UMBRELLA AND A MACHETE\nWHISHING: THROUGH THETR AIR AND HITTING BIRDS)\nWHISHING: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 122 of 133\nWHISHING: THE DOCTOR There! Got you! And again! Take that!\nWHISHING: (FX: THE FLUTTERING REDUCES AND DIES AWAY TO NOTHING. THE\nUMBRELLA: STOPS SWISHING THROUGH THE ATR)\nUMBRELLA: THE DOCTOR That’s all of them, I think. Not a pleasant thing to do, but they were poisonous, and vicious.\nKLEIN: (ADMIRINGLY) I remember you saying that anything can be used as a weapon, but I didn’t think an umbrella would count.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (SADLY) I’ll never be able to look at this umbrella in the same way.\nKLEIN: That was very clever, making Abraham rebel against his controllers.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR You played your part. I realize that the philosophy I was espousing is alien to your very nature.\nKLEIN: How do you mean?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: The word “fascism” comes from the Latin “fasces” —- meaning “a bunch of sticks tied together”. The idea is that people are stronger when they all work together than they are individually. The individual has no place in a fascist society. I was telling Abraham the exact opposite - and so were you.\nKLEIN: I was telling him what he needed to hear so that he would fight against the control of the Chaelis. I still believe that the subjugation of the individual is necessary for the\nKLEIN: sake of the collective interests of the race. (BEAT) Of course, you appreciate the irony, don’t you?\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 123 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR What irony?\nKLEIN: In convincing Abraham not to do what you ended up convincing him to do what still being controlled.\nKLEIN: he Chaelis wanted, you wanted. He was\nKLEIN: ct ct\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (UNCERTAIN) He had a choice, Klein. I just let him exercise that choice.\nKLEIN: Just keep telling yourself that. (BEAT) (SHE BREAKS INTO A COUGHING FIT)\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR How are you doing?\nKLEIN: I’m holding it together. Just.\nKLEIN: It’s Abraham!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR He’s badly injured.\nKLEIN: I thought he was immune to the Chaelis’s poison.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR They’ve severed some major blood vessels. There’s nothing we can do.\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR No, stay where you are. Don’t try to move.\nKLEIN: He wants us to go with him.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 124 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Into the Chaelis dome!\nKLEIN: Doctor Who — A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 125 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 43: CHAELIS DOME\nKLEIN: (FX: ALIEN ATMOSPHERICS, POSSIBLY WIND CHIMES IN AN AEOLIAN MODE. OR SOMETHING)\nKLEIN: Doctor, I’m not sure I can make it much further.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I don’t think there’s far to go. We’re nearly in the centre of the dome. (BEAT) Have you noticed the architecture?\nKLEIN: I’ve been too busy trying not to pass out.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: The main corridors are obviously built for Abraham and his ilk, but the holes in the tops of the walls are probably there to allow the Chaelis flock to fly around.\nKLEIN: Super.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Ah, here we are. The centre.\nKLEIN: (FX: THE VOICES CHANGE TIMBRE NOW, AS IF THEY ARE STANDING IN A MUCH LARGER AREA)\nKLEIN: think I recognize some of that equipment.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Tt’s alien.\nKLEIN: Yes, but there’s only so many ways you can build a centrifuge, or a fractional distillation column. This is\nKLEIN: their laboratory. This is where they’ve been doing their experiments.\nABRAHAM: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 126 of 133\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR What is it, my friend?\nKLEIN: He wants us to go over there.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Ah, a refrigerated storage area.\nKLEIN: What’s he pointing at?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR That flask.\nKLEIN: You don't think..?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: That it’s the universal cure that the Chaelis developed for their bioengineered diseases? It rather looks that way. And that device beside it looks like a transdermal injector.\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR That’s all very well, but how do I know what the dose should be?\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR Ah, I see. The injector has a scanner mode. (BEAT)\nABRAHAM: (MUSES) Let me see.\nABRAHAM: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 127 of 133\nABRAHAM: THE DOCTOR Hold your arm out.\nKLEIN: I was poisoned, not infected.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: imagine the Chaelis poison is a byproduct of their biological research. And if I were them, I would make sure that my universal cure worked against the widest possible set of illnesses.\nKLEIN: Are you sure about this?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR I’m not sure about anything. Certainty is the first step towards dictatorship.\nKLEIN: (MUTTERS) You never stop, do you?\nKLEIN: Ow! Cold!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Don’t be a child.\nKLEIN: Abraham!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (SADLY) He’s finished. The strain of bringing us in here has been too much for him.\nKLEIN: But he saved my life.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR He saved everyone’s life.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 128 of 133\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 129 of 133\nKLEIN: SCENE 44: THE HALL\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Halloo! Is anyone home?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And answer came there none. I don’t like it.\nKLEIN: (MUCH HEALTHIER THAN BEFORE) I think I share your concern. Let’s search the house. We need to find Lucy as quickly as possible, so we can give her the Chaelis’s treatment.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who - A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page\nKLEIN: SCENE 45: SYLVIA’S BEDROOM\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR (DISTANT, OUT IN THE HALL, CALLING) Mrs O’Donnell?\nKLEIN: (ALSO DISTANT, OUT IN THE HALL, CALLING) Lucy?\nKLEIN: (HORRIFIED) No!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR What happened here?\nKLEIN: I can’t imagine anyone losing this much blood and surviving.\nSYLVIA: (OFF TO ONE SIDE) They didn’t.\nKLEIN: Sylvia!\nSYLVIA: (TIREDLY) It’s Joshua’s blood.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR Did the Mau Mau attack?\nSYLVIA: In a sense. Joshua was the Mau Mau. One of them, caught him signaling to them. He attacked me.\nKLEIN: What happened?\nKLEIN: 130: Of 133\nKLEIN: Lucy?\nKLEIN: anyway.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 131 of 133\nSYLVIA: Lucy happened. She came up behind him and hit him with a lantern. And then she just... collapsed. I think the strain was just too much for her. I couldn’t feel a pulse.\nSYLVIA: She wasn’t breathing. A few seconds before there were three people in this house, and suddenly there was only one. Me.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: What did you do with... with the bodies?\nSYLVIA: Lucy’s body I put in the bedroom with Denise’s. (ANGRIER)\nSYLVIA: Joshua’s I just left outside, in the garden for the hyenas to take.\nKLEIN: And the Mau Mau?\nSYLVIA: Either they weren’t there, or when Joshua’s signal was cut short they decided to retreat. Either way, there was no attack. I was just... left alone, here in the house. (BEAT) (BRIGHTER) And what about you, Elizabeth? Was your quest a success?\nKLEIN: I think I’m cured, but Abraham is dead.\nSYLVIA: So many people dead. So many people to be buried.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: There is something else that needs to be buried, Mrs O’Donnell. There’s a dome, out in the rainforest. It needs to have earth piled over it, as much earth as you can manage. It needs to be buried so that nobody ever finds it again. It needs to be buried so that nothing ever gets out.\nSYLVIA: Couldn’t we just burn this dome, or blow it up?\nSYLVIA: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 132 of 133\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: Doctor Klein has told me about the consequences if we try that. Burying it is the only way. And I need more of you, Sylvia. I need you to stay here, even after the rebellion is over, even after the Kenyans get their independence. I need you and your husband to stay here and watch over that buried dome. Make sure that nothing ever disturbs it. And pass that responsibility on to your children, or to someone else. If you fail, if they fail, then what happened to Lucy will happen to the whole world.\nSYLVIA: And you won’t tell me why?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR It’s best that I don’t.\nSYLVIA: And what about you?\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR\nSYLVIA: I’1ll stay until the British Army gets here and the Situation stabilizes. I’1ll even stay until you find your husband, or he finds you. But I can’t stay forever. I\nSYLVIA: never do.\nSYLVIA: Will you stay, Elizabeth?\nKLEIN: No. I’m sorry, but no. I’ve done what I came here to do. I made a difference.\nSYLVIA: I’d better go and check the windows. It seems so pointless now, but life goes on, I suppose. We keep ourselves moving.\nSYLVIA: THE DOCTOR And what about you? Where will you go?\nKLEIN: (DISENCHANTED) Back to South America, perhaps. Back to De Flores and his wolves.\nKLEIN: Doctor Who -— A Thousand Tiny Wings / Page 133 of 133\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR And you think I’m going to let you set about creating a Fourth Reich from scratch?\nKLEIN: I don’t see how you could stop me, short of killing me, and that would make a mockery of everything you did to save me.\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: I didn’t save you in order to let you rewrite history, Klein. I need you where I can keep an eye on you.\nKLEIN: (AGHAST) You’re going to stay with me and watch me until I die?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR Quite the reverse. You are coming with me.\nKLEIN: (NOT QUITE BELIEVING HER EARS) You are going to give me access to a time machine and the whole of human history? Do you really understand what you are proposing?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR\nKLEIN: Better than you, I suspect. Your perspective is too shallow. There are things out there you need to see. (BEAT) Do you accept?\nKLEIN: No conditions? No parole?\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR No conditions. No parole.\nKLEIN: Then yes. For better or worse, I’m coming with you.\nKLEIN: END"
