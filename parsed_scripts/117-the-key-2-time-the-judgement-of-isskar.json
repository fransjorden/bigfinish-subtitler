      "searchable_dialogue": "DOCTOR: Peri? Can you hear me? Peri. Peri!\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on. You're meant to be a compass. Is that north or north by north-west? Oh. Good afternoon.\nAMY: Good afternoon.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I assume you did that?\nAMY: Did what?\nDOCTOR: Stopped it raining? On a planet where the rain never stops.\nAMY: The rain hasn't stopped.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. You've stopped Time. The rain's just hanging in the air. I notice you're not wet at all and you don't have an umbrella. I wish I did.\nAMY: (laughs) You must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Hello. You... you're not hurt and your clothes aren't torn so I'm guessing you're not a survivor from one of the crashed ships here. Who are you?\nAMY: I don't know. How would I tell?\nDOCTOR: Good question. But you were expecting me.\nAMY: I was made to expect you.\nDOCTOR: Someone's forcing you?\nAMY: No. I was made, built to expect you, by The Grace.\nDOCTOR: The Grace? They sound like they should have better manners.\nAMY: I need your help, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, I'm always keen to help. So, who are The Grace? I assume they're the ones who stopped Time?\nAMY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: So they're probably huge and pan-dimensional with amazing powers our universe can barely conceive and yet they need me to run an errand.\nAMY: No. They want me to find three of the segments of the Key to Time. / want you to help me.\nDOCTOR: What, as a sort of assistant?\nAMY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Well, obviously I'm flattered. Hang on. You said the Key to Time.\nAMY: Yes. Like me, it was built by the Grace. The Key to Time is a perfect cube which maintains the equilibrium of Time itself. When its six crystal segments are assembled, it can stop and start the universe. It can re-write matter and change the states of quanta. It can restore balance.\nDOCTOR: And the six crystal segments are currently scattered through all Time and Space, disguised as anything and anyone.\nAMY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Thought so. And you just need to find three of the six pieces.\nAMY: Yes. Just three of them.\nDOCTOR: Well, forget it. I'm busy.\nAMY: Doing what?\nDOCTOR: Lots of things. Have you seen a young woman wandering about lost? She'd be in the least practical clothes.\nAMY: Your woman can wait. Time has stopped here until you get back from helping me.\nDOCTOR: I'd sooner find out while I'm here. The storm makes it hard to tell where you are and she lacks my unerring sense of direction and of course this compass.\nAMY: That's not a compass.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was coming to that conclusion myself. Still, it led me to you. Oh. It's not a compass, is it?\nAMY: That's what I said.\nDOCTOR: It was there in the wreckage of a ship called The Green Man's Burden and I just picked it up. Me, I don't need a compass but something about it... Did the Grace bring the Tardis here? I thought the controls were being sticky.\nAMY: Give the compass to me.\nDOCTOR: How do I know I can trust you?\nAMY: What? But you know about the Key to Time, don't you?\nDOCTOR: Yes I do, but how do I know that you don't want it for the wrong reasons?\nAMY: I... don't know.\nDOCTOR: How do I know you're not an agent of the Black Guardian? He's tried to trick me like this before. So how do I know I can trust you? You really don't know, do you?\nAMY: No.\nDOCTOR: Say please.\nAMY: Please.\nDOCTOR: All right, since you asked so nicely you can have the compass.\nAMY: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: But we'll need to convert it from a compass back into a crystal segment. When I did this last time I had a Tracer thing.\nAMY: One crystal segment.\nDOCTOR: Very clever. You are a Tracer, aren't you? That saves a lot of mucking about. Does it tickle?\nAMY: (laughs) Oh. It tickles. My nose feels all tickly.\nDOCTOR: I remember the first time Nyssa tried chocolate. Look, careful, you're going to drop it.\nAMY: No I'm not. I'm going to put it in my satchel.\nDOCTOR: Your satchel?\nAMY: The inside is in a different universe, with amazing powers this universe can barely conceive.\nDOCTOR: And such a pretty colour. So what, once they're in the satchel, no-one can touch them?\nAMY: Yes. Though I can feel it in there.\nDOCTOR: And it will be safe in there?\nAMY: Safe from what?\nDOCTOR: This universe can be a bit dangerous and unpredictable. You're quite naive, aren't you?\nAMY: I'm only four minutes old. Do you mean the Guardians? I'm not meant to involve them.\nDOCTOR: The two Guardians are elemental forces with who knows what kind of powers. They're the ones who wanted the Key to Time before. They could help.\nAMY: They could make things more difficult.\nDOCTOR: True. But like everyone else, the Key to Time offers amazing unimaginable power. They're drawn to it.\nAMY: You're not?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I am. I'm tempted to make things better for everyone, force people to get along and have a nice time.\nAMY: But that would be good, wouldn't it?\nDOCTOR: You can't be a benevolent dictator. Force is always force.\nAMY: The Grace can force you to help me.\nDOCTOR: And squish me with just a thought. I'm sure they can.\nAMY: But they don't want you involved.\nDOCTOR: Oh? Why not?\nAMY: They know the sort of life you have. You're a bit dangerous and unpredictable. But I think that's why you can help me.\nDOCTOR: Because I have practical experience. The remaining two segments will be disguised, part of the places where they're hidden.\nAMY: Other people will be drawn to them, and I'm quite naive, so I won't be safe, will 1?\nDOCTOR: All right, I'll make you a deal. I'll help you find one segment, then you'll have the hang of it and you can find the other one yourself. I come back here to find my friend.\nAMY: It's a deal.\nDOCTOR: I assume we're taking my ship. Come on. Do you have a name?\nAMY: No. You could call me Peri.\nDOCTOR: Why would I do that?\nAMY: Or Doctor. I don't know any other names.\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry. Everyone should have their own name, and there's plenty to choose from. A... Abigail? Acacia? Acantha?\nDOCTOR: You'll stop me when you like one.\nAMY: /f I like one.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: You'll like one. Adda? Addama? Adella? Adelaide?\nDOCTOR: Adiambo...\nDOCTOR: Amethyst. Amira? Amritha? Amy?\nAMY: Oh. That's amazing.\nDOCTOR: All right, Amy it is. Amy.\nAMY: Huh? Oh no. I mean this place. It's... I guess it's warm. I've not been warm before.\nDOCTOR: It would be even warmer without all these pools and fountains. They're a central cooling system for this whole... I think it's a fortified town on Medina, and they've been having a fiesta, judging by the state of the place. Someone is probably nursing a hangover instead of tidying up.\nAMY: See? I knew you'd know this sort of thing. Saves me having to look it all up.\nDOCTOR: Well, if instead of just taking control of my ship you'd let me set some coordinates, we'd know where we are.\nAMY: I'm sorry.\nDOCTOR: Are you?\nAMY: Yes, I think so.\nDOCTOR: Well, good. Come on, now it's your turn to be the clever one. Where's the second segment?\nAMY: Er, my nose is more tickly... in that direction.\nDOCTOR: Well, let's go over there, then. Mind the broken roof-tiles. Whoops! Less gravity than I'm used to. I need heavier shoes. Just look at that.\nAMY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: What does it look like? Some kind of flying car or skiff. Just look at the magnetic drive. Probably makes it very nippy and manoeuvrable. Keep up, Amy.\nAMY: Why the hurry? I thought you liked this sort of thing.\nDOCTOR: Mooching round new places, seeing what's to see? I suppose I do like doing that, but I want to get the second segment and be out of here before... Quick!\nAMY: You're squishing me.\nDOCTOR: Shh! I think he saw us.\nAMY: Oh. Who did?\nICE WARRIOR: You there.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. He's seen us. Let me do the talking. Good afternoon.\nAMY: Do you know that man?\nDOCTOR: It's an Ice Warrior.\nAMY: Oh.\nICE WARRIOR: You are aliens.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but nice ones. Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Amy.\nAMY: I didn't say I liked that name.\nDOCTOR: Shush. Don't worry about her, she's only ten minutes old.\nICE WARRIOR: There are rules for dealing with aliens.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure there are. Look, we don't want to cause any bother.\nICE WARRIOR: Can I offer you water?\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I think we're both fine. Don't want to be greedy, do we, Amy?\nAMY: Aren't you meant to be a warrior?\nICE WARRIOR: I do not know what warrior is, but I am keen to assist you if I can.\nDOCTOR: Oh, well, that's very decent of you. We just fancied a bit of a wander, stretch our legs, see what's what, dawdle idly. We don't want to put you to any trouble.\nICE WARRIOR: It is given freely, but I recommend you try the market before it closes.\nDOCTOR: The market? Right.\nICE WARRIOR: Ah, there's a good view of the vast pyramid there, and I think it is probably the best market on Mars.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, did you say Mars?\nAMY: It's incredible. There's so many people. Talking, working, playing music. Those two are kissing.\nDOCTOR: I've only ever been to Mars when the Martians were long gone. Joined a NASA mission, no, not that long ago. And there was that archaeological project in 2560 er, something. But you're right. Vibrant, convivial, and peaceable. A species who can't abide what we call room temperature, and they've built a town right on the equator.\nAMY: Is that clever?\nDOCTOR: The shell-like buildings reflect the heat. I guess the splits in them let the heat out too. And the canals and waterways keep the air cool. If I remember the write-up from the dig, the whole of Mars had been criss-crossed with intricate waterways. Despite their susceptibility to heat, Martians lived all over the surface of their planet.\nICE WARRIOR: (female) Would you like water, alien? It's given freely.\nDOCTOR: It's very kind of you, Madam, but we have an appointment.\nAMY: No we don't.\nDOCTOR: With the second segment. How's your tickly nose?\nAMY: It's tickly. I think it must be right in front of us towards that... Oh.\nDOCTOR: Towards that vast pyramid they've nearly completed. Well, that's not very ostentatious, is it? Least they won't notice us stealing that.\nAMY: It's not the pyramid.\nDOCTOR: Well, that makes things easier.\nAMY: It's the capstone on the top.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well, it'll be a simple job to clamber all the way up there and take it, with only everyone able to see us. Are you all right?\nAMY: The segment. It's not just tickly.\nDOCTOR: Amy, what is it?\nAMY: I... don't know what the word is. Oh no, not again.\nDOCTOR: An earthquake. You idiot, Doctor, not a fiesta, an earthquake!\nAMY: It's tickling in my head.\nDOCTOR: Amy, come on, we've got to find somewhere safe.\nAMY: It's the segment.\nDOCTOR: We've got to get away from the buildings. They're liable to fall!\nAMY: There's another one under here. I can see his feet. Quick. Okay. Everyone lift at once.\nICE WARRIOR: Three, two, one.\nAMY: That's it. That's it, he's... Oh.\nICE WARRIOR: He is dead.\nDOCTOR: It's all right, honestly. I'm a Doctor. No, no, no. Let me see. Your shell's cracked. I think some sand's got in. That's irritating where you're wounded. Agonising, I expect, but not life-threatening. Okay, I'm going to have to get you on a stretcher. Okay. Good. You're being very brave. These two helpful fellas are going to take you to the apothecary. They'll be as gentle as they can be. Now, keep his leg raised. He's lost a lot of blood.\nICE WARRIOR: Thank you, alien.\nDOCTOR: It's given freely. Ah, Amy. I think I'm done here. How are you feeling?\nAMY: Oh. I'm good.\nDOCTOR: You don't seem to have broken anything. You don't even seem to be bruised.\nAMY: I got some dust in my eye but I blinked and it fell out. You've got blood coming out of you.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I'd noticed. We think six Martians died.\nAMY: I don't... I don't like that.\nDOCTOR: No. No, no, but it could have been much worse, and we helped the ones we could.\nAMY: They kept offering to get me water.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, me too. It's a gift economy. They don't buy things, they give them away. It's all wrapped up in a code of honour, like Christmas cards.\nAMY: I don't understand.\nDOCTOR: Oh, er, well, you send Christmas cards out to everyone, and it's on their honour to send you a Christmas card back.\nAMY: And, what, that's not how markets work normally?\nDOCTOR: Not everywhere, no. I thought they were soldiers, but they're more like an arts and crafts commune, swapping goods as they're needed. They've got theatre and science and what I think is a kind of political singing.\nAMY: And they don't know what warrior means. They've never had any wars.\nDOCTOR: No. Martians learn to fight, to hunt animals for food, but they don't fight one another, at least not yet. It's er, well, it's not what I was expecting.\nAMY: We could stay if you like, for a while.\nDOCTOR: We need to get that second segment. It was what caused the earthquake, wasn't it? Wasn't it?\nAMY: Something isn't right.\nDOCTOR: Come on. We don't want anyone else to suffer.\nAMY: But we can't just go up there and take it. Someone will see.\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to make sure they don't notice us.\nICE WARRIOR: Alien.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Er, yes?\nICE WARRIOR: You and your female are under arrest.\nISSKAR: Go on, Doctor, guess.\nDOCTOR: Er, twelve thousand.\nISSKAR: More.\nDOCTOR: Thirteen thousand.\nISSKAR: More.\nAMY: Forty eight million billion, fifteen thousand and six.\nISSKAR: Ah. (laughs) Fewer. The vast pyramid has employed nineteen thousand literate masons, six hundred carpenters and forty six overseers, as well as the providence of the old Gods.\nDOCTOR: Hmn, yes, I recognise their influence in the apothem. It's built for the golden ratio, isn't it? A plus Bis to Aas Ais to B.\nISSKAR: Indeed, Doctor.\nAMY: A ratio of one to one point six one eight oh three nine eight...\nDOCTOR: More or less, yes.\nISSKAR: You are both literates.\nDOCTOR: And numerates, Isskar. I've seen that ratio written all across the universe from sequences in DNA to the hearts of stars.\nAMY: The Grace use it to measure integrals...\nDOCTOR: I'm sure the Magistrate doesn't need to know.\nAMY: Oh yes. Sorry.\nISSKAR: We understand the numbers, so the pyramid cannot be the cause of the earthquakes. Our engineers would not allow it.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure they didn't mean to. You say earthquakes, plural.\nISSKAR: They started when our moons were half their weight. In the last few days there have been more of them. But with less effect, it is passing.\nDOCTOR: Is it? You know the story of the Hubris of Jebb? A nut raining wet fire on his house for a year but he refused to admit it.\nISSKAR: Did the Old Gods teach your people astronomy too, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Actually we taught... Er, we taught ourselves. Though from the same first principles. Observation, evidence.\nISSKAR: (laughs.) The Ice Lords in the North should meet you. You're not like the reports.\nDOCTOR: Not all aliens are the same, Isskar.\nISSKAR: No. But my own beadles described you as thieves.\nAMY: They can't mean us.\nISSKAR: A male and a female without scales.\nDOCTOR: You don't get many alien visitors around here, do you?\nISSKAR: No.\nAMY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Most species are wary of strangers. It's a good survival instinct. We've been singled out.\nISSKAR: You'll understand if my beadles keep a watch on you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I understand perfectly.\nISSKAR: And you'll stay away from the vast pyramid. The building site is restricted.\nAMY: But we have to get the sec...\nDOCTOR: We understand, Magistrate Isskar.\nAMY: But Doctor, we need the...\nISSKAR: Trespass will be punished severely.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I rather thought it would. Thank you, Magistrate. You've been very kind. We've taken up far too much of your time and we should get on with our dawdling about. I'll bet there's some lovely boutiques as yet undiscovered where we can find some... postcards. Come on, Amy.\nAMY: Oh. Thank you for the water.\nISSKAR: It was given freely.\nAMY: I don't understand. He let us go.\nDOCTOR: They're reasonable people, Amy. He was just giving us fair warning.\nAMY: But you told him we wouldn't go near the pyramid.\nDOCTOR: I said I understood. If we get caught they'll treat us severely.\nAMY: But we don't have any choice.\nDOCTOR: There's always a choice, Amy.\nAMY: No there's not. There's going to be another earthquake!\nDOCTOR: Not if we can help it. Come on.\nAMY: But Doctor...\nDOCTOR: What?\nAMY: The building site? The entrance is over here.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Right. Well, after you.\nICE WARRIOR: Get to the shelters. Move, quickly.\nAMY: There's nobody left in here.\nDOCTOR: Only an idiot goes into a building site in the middle of an earthquake. Come on, we need to be the other side of this fence.\nAMY: There's always the door. It doesn't open.\nDOCTOR: Here, let me try. One day I must fix myself another sonic screwdriver. It would save me so much time.\nAMY: I thought you said we had to do this quietly.\nDOCTOR: So I did. After you.\nAMY: What if there are Martians in there?\nDOCTOR: Then we'll tell them Isskar sent us.\nAMY: But he didn't.\nDOCTOR: No, but they don't need to know that. What?\nAMY: My nose is tickly.\nDOCTOR: That's because we're getting near the segment. Just have a bit of a climb.\nAMY: No, it's not that. It's different. I think there's someone else here.\nDOCTOR: Someone's coming. Hide. We'll let them go past then we'll carry on.\nAMY: Okay.\nZARA: Get off me!\nICE WARRIOR: Trespassers will be punished severely.\nZARA: We're not doing anything. We're tourists. You don't do this to tourists.\nAMY: But that's...\nDOCTOR: Amy, wait! Come back.\nAMY: We have to help her.\nICE WARRIOR: Save it for the beadle. He has more patience than me.\nZARA: But we just wanted to take a photograph. Isn't that right, Zinc?\nZINC: That's right.\nZARA: Zinc? You're choking him, you clumsy oaf.\nICE WARRIOR: I am trying not to, but he keeps struggling. If you'd both just...\nAMY: Let them go!\nDOCTOR: Amy, stop it, this won't do us any good. He's not trying to hurt them.\nICE WARRIOR: That's what I was trying to explain to the short man. You aliens are small, soft-boned and fragile.\nDOCTOR: No - no, wait!\nAMY: You killed him.\nZARA: You killed him! Well done, Zinc.\nZINC: He had it coming. Said I was small.\nAMY: You killed him.\nDOCTOR: Yes, he's dead, Amy. I think Isskar mistook us for these two. You must be the thieves.\nZINC: You should watch what you're accusing people of, Mister. I don't like name-calling. And I'm the one with the gun.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so you are. Please let Amy go, she's nothing to you.\nZARA: (laughs) Amy. Have you got yourself a name?\nAMY: I didn't say I liked it.\nDOCTOR: You know these people, do you?\nAMY: Her, not him.\nZINC: Oh, charming. You should be more like your big sister.\nDOCTOR: You're sisters?\nAMY: Not really.\nZARA: It's the simplest way to explain it.\nZINC: And you can see the family resemblance. Same eyes, same cheekbones, same clever school-bags.\nDOCTOR: You're after the other three segments, are you?\nZARA: Not found any yet. Have you?\nAMY: We've got one.\nZARA: That means the one here is mine. It's only fair.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure there's enough segments for everyone.\nZARA: And you are...? Oh. Oh, it's you.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, you've got me at a disadvantage. I'm the Doctor.\nZARA: I knew it. I Knew she'd pick you up. The Grace said he'd be trouble...\nAMY: I needed an assistant.\nZARA: And so did I. But I didn't feel the need to hunt down the one guy who...\nAMY: All right! He's been useful. He knows how to do this stuff.\nDOCTOR: Er, Amy, we should be going.\nZINC: Yeah. They'll be back here soon enough. We can't be near the body.\nZARA: Let's go.\nDOCTOR: Amy, come on. Amy, you can't stay here.\nAMY: They killed him. They killed him.\nDOCTOR: I know. But if we stay here they'll think it was us. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Once we leave the cover of the scaffolding, everyone can see us.\nZINC: It looks like another... hundred metres to the top.\nAMY: Ninety eight... So, ninety eight more of these... Oh, I guess they're too big to call steps?\nDOCTOR: Yes well, little bracing exercise, good for the circulation.\nZARA: Oh, you're kidding.\nDOCTOR: Ninety seven. And then we've got to work out an escape plan too.\nZARA: Oh, amateurs.\nAMY: What's that meant to mean?\nDOCTOR: I assume you have a plan, Mister... I'm sorry, I don't know your name.\nZINC: Harmonious Fourteen Zinc.\nDOCTOR: Ah, from the Commune of the White Sun.\nZINC: Yeah, originally. Haven't been home in years. Why bother when you can go anywhere and when.\nDOCTOR: I've always thought so.\nZINC: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Though I did like the White Sun's tree-houses. Spent a week in Hauldon. Mostly being accused of blotting out the sunlight, which was just an unhappy coincidence, but... apart from being imprisoned and threatened with various kinds of torture... lovely people, I thought.\nZINC: Yeah.\nZARA: So, you haven't told him, then?\nAMY: I didn't think it would help.\nZARA: He'll find out soon enough.\nAMY: Maybe.\nZARA: And he'll leave you to it, because you lied. He'll leave you.\nAMY: He's not like your one.\nZARA: Zinc has taught me a lot.\nAMY: I can see that. You're... well, I can see him in your eyes and how you move. Has he given you a name?\nZARA: What do I want a name for?\nAMY: Everyone should have their own name. Isn't that right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: What's that?\nAMY: She should have a name.\nZARA: I don't want a name.\nZINC: She's a construct. She's not real.\nDOCTOR: But she's still a she. A name will help her build an identity, become someone real. So, starting with A.\nAMY: But that's the same as me.\nDOCTOR: All right, er... Z. Z, er... Zoe. I used to know a Zoe. Zinnia. Zillah. Zena. Er, Zelda, Zynab, Zara...\nZINC: Zara was my mum's name.\nDOCTOR: It's a nice name. It means Princess.\nZARA: Oh, go on then, I'll have that one. Just to shut you up.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop.\nAMY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I can see him. Need to get a move on. Sixty four steps to go.\nAMY: He's faster than we are.\nDOCTOR: Never seen Martians move so quickly. Must be the low gravity, their natural environment.\nZARA: So he'll catch us.\nZINC: I've still got my gun.\nDOCTOR: Can I see that?\nZINC: You want to do the honours? Here.\nDOCTOR: Whoops! Oh, butterfingers.\nZARA: You did that on purpose.\nAMY: You would have used it again.\nZINC: My wife gave me that gun.\nDOCTOR: How romantic. Sorry. Enough people have died.\nZINC: And you might have just killed us.\nDOCTOR: Not if you've got an escape route. What do you use, if you don't mind my asking?\nZINC: I think you're in the same game. See this?\nDOCTOR: A bracelet.\nZINC: It's a time ring. Picked it up on Barampa. The VP Party had it in a museum, thought it was just ceremonial. So I er, I borrowed it.\nDOCTOR: I see. So why not materialise on the capstone itself, grab the segment and dash off again?\nZARA: Oh, that's what we've been trying to do.\nZINC: Something skews the coordinates. One time we found ourselves six weeks out, and in the middle of a desert.\nAMY: Amateurs.\nZINC: Don't get cocky. I've only ever used this thing with two.\nDOCTOR: A short hop won't hurt it. Drop us in the market. we have our own transport.\nZINC: What, some sort of a capsule?\nDOCTOR: It's a retro thing. So what do you say? We are family after all.\nZARA: Long as I get this segment.\nAMY: Yes, you get the segment.\nDOCTOR: Good. Come on, we're almost there.\nZARA: No we're not.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop, or I will shoot you.\nDOCTOR: Just climb.\nAMY: My head. It's in my head.\nZARA: Got to... got to get nearer.\nDOCTOR: Almost there. Just keep going.\nICE WARRIOR: Your final warning.\nZINC: Get a move on!\nZARA: I can't!\nDOCTOR: The capstone. What's happened to it?\nICE WARRIOR: There is nowhere you can run.\nZARA: I can't get near it.\nAMY: But it's not there. It's out of reach.\nZINC: But I can see it. I can... Ow! Ah!\nDOCTOR: Careful. It's a long way down.\nZINC: Yeah. And look. From here you can see the shockwaves, rippling through the canals and waterways.\nAMY: The segment is causing the earthquake.\nDOCTOR: We have to stop it.\nZARA: But we can't touch it.\nDOCTOR: There's something wrong with the segments, isn't there? That's why you needed to fetch them back in.\nZARA: They're decaying. Their powers are warping.\nICE WARRIOR: Raise your arms. I will shoot any one of you.\nDOCTOR: It's imploding. Forming a gravity well. Maybe a black hole.\nZINC: It'll destroy Mars.\nICE WARRIOR: You are my prisoners. You will not destroy Mars.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Mars is the least of our worries. If the Key to Time collapses, the universe is finished."

There's no need to shoot anyone.\nICE WARRIOR: You killed Asskor.\nZINC: Not - not me. He did.\nDOCTOR: Me? It's his fingerprints on the gun. I can explain about the fingerprints.\nAMY: Doctor!\nICE WARRIOR: Leave the capstone. I will shoot you.\nDOCTOR: It's the capstone that's causing the earthquakes. Really, we're only trying to help.\nICE WARRIOR: I will call Magistrate Isskar.\nDOCTOR: Good. That makes sense.\nICE WARRIOR: To tell him I have taken you prisoner. A message for Magistrate Isskar...\nZARA: I can reach it. Amy, if we reach it together...\nAMY: Yes.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop!\nZINC: Don't, don't, don't worry mate, it's not like they can pinch it from right in front of you, is it?\nDOCTOR: Both of you, wait. The segment's created a gravity well. Removing it could be like pulling a plug, and we're standing right on the plug hole.\nZARA: But I can feel it. (screams)\nAMY: Zara!\nDOCTOR: It won't let you touch it. It's setting your fingers alight.\nAMY: See? Told you.\nDOCTOR: It's going to be all right. We'll get your hands seen to.\nICE WARRIOR: What have you done?\nZINC: We've stopped the earthquakes, obviously. I hope there's a reward.\nDOCTOR: The Martians don't work like that, Zinc.\nICE WARRIOR: You have stopped the earthquakes, but where is the capstone?\nZARA: Here, in this crystal. It's holding a black hole at bay. I can feel it pressing against the sides. Such a lot of power. Mine now.\nDOCTOR: Zara, you can't leave with it, not yet. Let me get back to my ship. Maybe I can repair the damage then you can go.\nZARA: Oh, you'll allow that, will you?\nAMY: He's trying to help. What's happened to you?\nDOCTOR: You were different too after you got your first segment.\nAMY: Was I?\nZINC: And she's got two segments now.\nDOCTOR: What?\nAMY: You lied.\nZARA: We picked up the first one on Erratoon. Nobody there's going to miss it.\nICE WARRIOR: You will give me the crystal.\nZARA: Will I?\nDOCTOR: Do as he says, Zara. He's got the gun.\nZARA: Go on, Martian. Do your worst.\nZINC: Now, wait a...\nZARA: Is that all you've got?\nDOCTOR: The segment must be protecting her.\nZINC: That's a neat trick. Probably worth something.\nZARA: Oh, can you only think about money?\nZINC: It's all that really makes a difference, sweetheart.\nZARA: Yeah, I think I've outgrown you now, Zinc.\nZINC: Huh? What’s that meant to mean? Hey! That's mine.\nZARA: With the time ring, I don't need you at all.\nZINC: Now, wait.\nDOCTOR: Zara, don't do this. You're condemning us all.\nZARA: I know, Goodbye.\nICE WARRIOR: Where did she go?\nDOCTOR: We don't have time. Quick, down the pyramid.\nZINC: We're right on top of the earthquakes.\nDOCTOR: The pyramid is going to collapse!\nISSKAR: This is magistrate Isskar. You aliens are under arrest.\nDOCTOR: Brilliant, Isskar.\nAMY: How do we get aboard?\nICE WARRIOR: The forcefield is extending.\nDOCTOR: Great. Amy, Zinc, we have to jump.\nZINC: I don't feel any safer.\nDOCTOR: We need to fly into the gravity well. If you don't it'll tear us apart.\nICE WARRIOR: Alien, stay back from the controls.\nDOCTOR: You're going to kill everyone on board.\nAMY: Listen to him. He knows about this kind of thing. Isskar, please.\nISSKAR: Let him take the helm.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Right. Er, gears, clutch, stereo radio, so this one must be the thrust. Oh!\nAMY: It's not working!\nISSKAR: You will not survive either.\nDOCTOR: Oh ye of little... faith.\nZINC: Well done, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That's better.\nAMY: We're safe?\nDOCTOR: We're in a holding pattern about two hundred metres above the ground which is ripping itself to pieces. Enough fuel for maybe an hour, then it gets a bit tricky.\nISSKAR: You will step away from the controls now.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don't mention it. It was given freely.\nISSKAR: It is an unprovoked attack. We shall repay the debt upon you.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, it's too late for that. You need to start an evacuation. Get everyone out of the town.\nISSKAR: Our engineers will investigate.\nDOCTOR: There's a black hole on your doorstep. Look at what it's already done.\nISSKAR: The canals are boiling away.\nZINC: It's the heat trying to equalise.\nDOCTOR: What?\nZINC: I did spatial anomalies at school.\nAMY: Can't we do something?\nDOCTOR: We can get people away from here. Isskar, you have to listen... Ow!\nAMY: Doctor!\nISSKAR: You will undo what you have done.\nDOCTOR: It's too late for that, I'm sorry.\nISSKAR: But why?\nZINC: If I denounce them, can I get a more lenient sentence?\nDOCTOR: Zinc, that won't help.\nZINC: I just want to clarify my options. Well?\nISSKAR: Perhaps a less arduous death.\nZINC: Er... I'm sure we can do a bit better than that, huh?\nICE WARRIOR: Magistrate, orders from the Ice Lord. All ships are required to assist those still on the ground.\nDOCTOR: At least someone's using their intelligence.\nISSKAR: Take us down. I need an escort to come with me on the ground. Watch these three. Shoot the female if they try anything.\nAMY: Hey, why me?\nISSKAR: You have the least to say.\nAMY: That's so unfair.\nICE WARRIOR: Try nothing.\nAMY: I was just saying.\nZINC: So how do we get out of this one?\nAMY: I thought you were going to denounce us.\nZINC: I just wanted to clarify my options.\nDOCTOR: Nothing personal.\nZINC: Hey, you know how it is in this game.\nDOCTOR: We need to escape, get back to the Tardis.\nAMY: And then you can heal the black hole. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think it's too late for that, Amy.\nAMY: But the Martians. So many of them are going to die.\nDOCTOR: I know! I know.\nZINC: And us if we stick around.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so, we're almost on the ground now. Have you done much guarding before?\nICE WARRIOR: You will not get past me, alien.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of it. It's just - you're holding your sonic blaster the wrong way round.\nISSKAR: One at a time. One at a time. There is room for all of you on the skiff if you do not push.\nICE WARRIOR: Magistrate?\nISSKAR: I am a little busy.\nICE WARRIOR: But the aliens, they've escaped.\nISSKAR: What?\nZINC: Not all of them. Just the two guilty ones.\nICE WARRIOR: This one was recaptured.\nZINC: I surrendered. I said I'm not with those other two.\nISSKAR: Get after them. They must not escape.\nZINC: They'll be heading for their capsule. I think it's in the market.\nISSKAR: Do as he says.\nICE WARRIOR: Yes, Magistrate.\nZINC: See? I'm not with them.\nISSKAR: And now you wish for your reward?\nZINC: Well, I won't say no if there's one going.\nISSKAR: I said a less arduous death.\nZINC: What? Oh. Yeah, funny. Good to keep a sense of humour when your whole world's going to... Oh, wait. I can be useful. I can tell you all about the Key to Ti...\nISSKAR: We will repay this debt. I swear it.\nDOCTOR: One good thing about all this. They're all too busy to chase after us.\nAMY: But Harmonious Fourteen Zinc.\nDOCTOR: He's made his choice. Come on. The Tardis is just up here.\nAMY: But we can't leave them like this. We should stay, try to help.\nDOCTOR: There's nothing we can do, really.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop. Stop.\nDOCTOR: And they don't seem all that keen on our helping.\nAMY: But it's wrong to just leave them.\nDOCTOR: I know, Amy, I know.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop.\nDOCTOR: Right. Oh, sorry about the bumpy take-off. The gravity well passes right through the middle of Mars.\nAMY: She knew, didn't she?\nDOCTOR: Explains why Zinc's time ring kept being knocked off course.\nAMY: She knew what it would do, didn't she, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think she must have had some idea, Amy. The Key to Time boasts terrible power. People can't help being drawn to it.\nAMY: So it's not her fault?\nDOCTOR: No, it's her fault.\nAMY: But I wanted that segment just as much as she did. I wanted that power too.\nDOCTOR: Maybe. But you're also horrified by what it did.\nAMY: The Martians are going to die.\nDOCTOR: The gravity well will work itself out in time, but it will change conditions on the planet, so they'll have to move somewhere new. They'll work that out soon enough.\nAMY: So it's going to be all right?\nDOCTOR: No. Not all right. Millions of them will die before they'll admit there's a long-term problem. They're a brilliant culture in so many ways but pride can blind even the best of us.\nAMY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Er... all kind of spatial disturbances. Holes being eaten in Time.\nAMY: It's Zara.\nDOCTOR: Or the remaining segments. They're all starting to decay. That's why you and Zara have to find them.\nAMY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: You should have told me.\nAMY: I di... I didn't think you'd want to know.\nDOCTOR: That the Key to Time is collapsing and with it the whole of the universe?\nAMY: And it's your fault.\nDOCTOR: I see. That's why the Grace didn't want me involved.\nAMY: I... I thought you'd be the best person to help. It would... balance things out, make them right again.\nDOCTOR: What did I do?\nAMY: You put the key together without the sixth segment.\nDOCTOR: There were rather pressing reasons for it at the time. We had to mock up the final piece. It seemed to work okay.\nAMY: But that's not how the segments work. They depend on one another.\nDOCTOR: A design flaw.\nAMY: Maybe. The Grace never thought anyone would try something so reckless as substituting a segment.\nDOCTOR: So, I caused some kind of chain reaction and all the Charged Vacuum Emboitements and sticking\nDOCTOR: plaster couldn't put it back together again.\nAMY: It's all unravelling.\nDOCTOR: So the places where the segments are hidden are in immediate danger. And they're only a fraction ahead of everyone else, but that means we've got not long left.\nAMY: The world where we met, where the Grace stopped the rain?\nDOCTOR: Where they stopped Time.\nAMY: That's the furthest into the future any of the segments are hidden, and sixty six minutes from the end of time.\nDOCTOR: Sixty six minutes? Not... well, quite a lot more millennia than that. And you can't hold off the rain for ever.\nAMY: The Grace have finite powers, entropy has set in.\nDOCTOR: They won't know what's hit them.\nAMY: If we could find Zara...\nDOCTOR: She'd cause us more trouble. No, I think we go and find the remaining segments and then see where we are.\nAMY: But I can't touch any more segments. I'll end up like her.\nDOCTOR: You're not the same as Zara, Amy. You're your own person.\nAMY: But if I touch another segment then I'll go...\nDOCTOR: I know. But it could hardly make anything worse.\nDOCTOR: So, which way do you think? We want to just grab the thing and go.\nAMY: I Know, but I'm tickly all over the place. It's up here and over there and underneath us. I don't understand.\nDOCTOR: There must be some kind of echo, perhaps to do with whatever the castle walls are made of. If we wander around a bit, you should get a clearer signal.\nAMY: So you know where we are this time?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere on a ring-world called Safeplace about sixteen thousand years since we were on Mars, and maybe twice as many light years. The last time I was in the area the whole galaxy was at war. I think there's been three or four generations since the Neek Armistice was signed. We're in the district inhabited by the Valdigians, one of your more civilised insect-like species.\nAMY: You should write a book or something.\nDOCTOR: And give away all my secrets? I like to retain a certain hint of mystery.\nAMY: Hence those symbols on your collar. I'm the Doctor, I'm the man of mystery.\nDOCTOR: You know, you've got a lot more sarcastic since we first met.\nAMY: I have a good teacher. It's not working. The signal is still all over the place.\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll keep going. I'm sure something will turn up. Ah. These are Valdigians. Guards, going by the stripes on their wings.\nVALDIGIAN: Intruders. Poisoners. Heretics. You are under arrest.\nDOCTOR: See? Told you.\nAMY: I think it must be a gift.\nTHETRIS: The ice should bring down the fever. You can't die, Lady Mesca. Your people need you. I need you.\nMESCA: I know. But I have no choice.\nTHETRIS: No. No! Wembik's faction are liars.\nMESCA: No.\nTHETRIS: Yes, of course they have done this. Who else could it have been?\nWEMBIK: Thetris, we are as horrified as you are. But perhaps Mesca is just unwell. The pressure incurred by these proceedings. It would not be unheard of.\nTHETRIS: Unwell? Unwell? She is dying. Wembik. You and your faction have cursed her, and you will not deny it.\nWEMBIK: That is quite an allegation. Did Mesca witness this cursing? Did she?\nMESCA: I saw nothing.\nWEMBIK: You see?\nTHETRIS: Do not try to speak. You must save your strength.\nMESCA: Thetris, you cannot start a war.\nTHETRIS: But I will not let this stand. They have cursed you.\nWEMBIK: Not us. Maybe it was them.\nVALDIGIAN: Poisoners. Aliens. Warmakers. Wingless freaks.\nDOCTOR: Hello. You're Valdigians, aren't you? I'm the Doctor, this is Amy. We just happen to be passing on a sort of treasure hunt.\nAMV: You can offer us some water if you like.\nTHETRIS: Strangers in the castle.\nWEMBIK: It's an outrage. I shall have the orderlies flogged.\nDOCTOR: We don't mean to intrude, but as I say we're on this sort of treasure hunt. Forgive me, but your friend there looks a bit peaky. Maybe I can...\nTHETRIS: Keep back from her.\nWEMBIK: This creature must have cursed her. It stands to reason.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but for what reason? I know it's a bit of a coincidence, but we've only just arrived.\nAMY: We've been singled out again, haven't we? Just because we're strangers.\nDOCTOR: Occupational hazard. Please, I'm a doctor. I really think that I can help.\nTHETRIS: You want to sell me a counter-charm?\nDOCTOR: It's offered freely.\nWEMBIK: Ha! It has to be a trick. Shall take the smaller one to be tortured. We will find the truth.\nAMY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: There's no need for that. I'm happy to help if I can.\nTHETRIS: Take her, Wembik. Find out what they've done.\nDOCTOR: Please, she's entirely innocent. We're just here looking for an artefact that will do you all terrible harm.\nWEMBIK: It will be my pleasure to obey, Thettris.\nAMY: (receding) Doctor, I don't want to be tortured! Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Please, she doesn't know anything. She's not even a day old.\nTHETRIS: You will apply the counter-charm, Doctor, or I'll have you tortured too.\nDOCTOR: I won't help you until you let her go.\nTHETRIS: Then your friend will die!\nMESCA: Please.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, let's see what we can do.\nWEMBIK: I don't know your kind of biology, creature. But we will start with the extremities and work our way inwards. You need not worry. The blades are heated, so they will be sterilised.\nAMY: It's not going to do any good, you know.\nWEMBIK: You think you can remain silent?\nAMY: No, but I don't know anything.\nWEMBIK: So you Say.\nAMV: Like the Doctor said, we're looking for something that could do you terrible harm. Oh, how can I convince you? I'll do anything.\nWEMBIK: You can tell me how you cursed the Lady Mesca. Now, this is just to start with. A pin prick. (whirring) Didn't you feel that?\nAMV: Yes. It prickles a bit. Oh, careful you don't burn yourself.\nWEMBIK: I will make you scream.\nAMY: Ooo! That hurts. Is that what you want?\nWEMBIK: Do not mock me.\nDOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. It's going to be all right.\nMESCA: You musin't let there be a war.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we'll get you on the mend soon enough then you can put things right and let my friend go. What's your name?\nMESCA: Mesca.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Mesca.\nTHETRIS: She is the Lady Mesca Amuntik, soon to be mother to the King.\nDOCTOR: You're pregnant?\nMESCA: Mmm. My son is eight orbits old. He and Wembik's boy are the two contenders for the crown.\nDOCTOR: I see. Raise your... arms. That's good. And the next pair. So you're here to sort out which one it is.\nMESCA: The castle has always served to resolve disputes, ever since Safeplace was constructed.\nDOCTOR: It's a neutral space. You should be safe here. Then you're suddenly struck down.\nTHETRIS: Wembik has dark powers.\nDOCTOR: Yes, she's not a people person, is she. You've not seen her wielding some unlikely artefact, have you? As if it's where her dark powers come from?\nTHETRIS: You mean like a magical wand?\nDOCTOR: Could be shaped like anything, but it would be the source of her magic.\nTHETRIS: Hmm. I don't think she has anything like that.\nDOCTOR: Ah well, just a thought. And who are you?\nTHETRIS: I am Thetris!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Thetris. Look, you can see I'm helping. Please release my friend.\nTHETRIS: Mesca must not die. I'd do anything!\nDOCTOR: Oh, are you two more than just colleagues?\nMESCA: He is the Captain of our Ceremonial Guard.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I like the uniform.\nMESCA: And we were to be married after the Kingship had been agreed.\nTHETRIS: It was to be kept secret until then. We did not wish it to confuse the discussion here. But Doctor, I will go to war for Mesca. Wembik's faction will not win, however they have done this.\nMESCA: I don't want there to be a war.\nDOCTOR: Civil wars are always the most brutal. And isn't it rather missing the point of living somewhere called Safeplace?\nTHETRIS: But I must do something! I cannot watch you die like this.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don't cancel the wedding yet. Mesca is going to be fine.\nTHETRIS: But, but you've not applied a charm.\nDOCTOR: No, but here, below her ap...\nTHETRIS: Oh, we are not meant to look at the dorsal regions.\nDOCTOR: Then that's why you won't have seen this. A bruise with two pinpricks in the centre. That's some kind of bite. Snake, or snake-ish, anyway. And I think I've got just the thing. Er. Oh, hold this a second.\nTHETRIS: What is it?\nDOCTOR: A yo-yo. Er, that's a King of Hearts. Ah, here we are.\nWEMBIK: Still nothing?\nAMY: Well, I can feel that it's sharp.\nWEMBIK: But we've not even raised your heart rate.\nAMY: Sorry. This must be quite frustrating.\nWEMBIK: I don't know what we're doing wrong.\nAMY: Maybe I'm just the wrong sort of creature. It probably just works on Valdigians.\nWEMBIK: I've never tortured a Valdigian.\nAMY: Oh. Well, I'm, I'm sure you're a good person, really.\nWEMBIK: I've never done anything like this before. It's stupid. It's not me.\nAMY: No.\nWEMBIK: But the chance for my son to be King. The thought of it.\nAMY: It tickles.\nWEMBIK: Yes. It tickles.\nAMY: I know that feeling. I've been close to power.\nWEMBIK: You want it too?\nAMY: No. I've seen what it can do.\nWEMBIK: Well, it's only ceremonial power I'm after.\nAMY: Oh. Well, that's all right, then.\nWEMBIK: Honestly. We're the descendants of refugees who've survived the war, and we're on a ring-world where everything's plentiful. We don't need Kings any more.\nAMY: But you still have them anyway?\nWEMBIK: You really have just arrived, haven't you? Our law says that a King can only rule from the age of twenty three. Until then a provisional government keeps the peace, and gets involved only when it has to.\nAMY: And does it have to? You said everything was plentiful.\nWEMBIK: Exactly. We don't want leaders. So, we elect a child who agrees to stand down at the age of twenty two. In return they get a generous pension for the rest of their life.\nAMY: So you never have a King.\nWEMBIK: And only as much government as is absolutely necessary.\nAMY: So you're going to war over an entirely meaningless role?\nWEMBIK: It's not meaningless, it's symbolic. And I don't mind if it's not my son in the role, so long as it's not Mesca's. She's always had everything her way, even when we were larvae.\nAMY: So that's why you poisoned her.\nWEMBIK: I didn't say I did.\nAMY: Well, maybe you didn't do it yourself, but I think you know who did.\nWEMBIK: Now, listen, alien.\nTHETRIS: Release the alien creature.\nWEMBIK: Thetris, I've not finished with her.\nAMY: But the Doctor must have cured Mesca.\nWEMBIK: We can but hope.\nTHETRIS: No. She's barely conscious, but he says he has the answer and I want you there. Release her.\nAMY: Oh, all right. You'd better undo my straps. Ow. My arm hurts.\nWEMBIK: Oh! It hurts you now.\nAMY: No, look. A bruise. Oh, come on. The Doctor should see this too.\nDOCTOR: Just concentrate on breathing, Mesca. In, and out. In, and out. We'll have you better soon. Amy. You're all right.\nAMV: Yes, I guess. Though I've got this bruise on my arm.\nDOCTOR: Let me see. That's interesting. You're becoming more susceptible to pain. Must be part of the learning process.\nAMY: Oh. That's good, is it?\nDOCTOR: It's a bit tricky, actually.\nAMY: It means they can hurt me.\nDOCTOR: It means I could poison you.\nAMY: Oh, and you were going to do that, were you?\nTHETRIS: The Doctor says his anti-charm is made from snake venom.\nAMY: That's either very clever or very not clever.\nWEMBIK: It will kill the girl.\nDOCTOR: It's an anti-toxin based on the poison in the wound. I had a kit in my pocket which identified the toxin at once. Amiscalia, venom of a local snake-like thing. But Thetris is keen we try it first before letting Mesca drink it.\nTHETRIS: You said it would not harm your friend.\nDOCTOR: Well, she was impervious to earthquakes, but now...\nTHETRIS: Give it to her.\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure that's a good idea.\nAMY: I don't mind. If it helps, I'll take it.\nDOCTOR: But it's made of poison.\nWEMBIK: You see? He admits it.\nTHETRIS: Give your friend the charm, Doctor, or I will kill you both.\nDOCTOR: I can't, not if she's changing herself.\nAMY: Oh, give it here.\nDOCTOR: Amy, don't, it could kill you.\nAMY: And he'll kill us both if I don't. I'm sure it will be fine. I trust you.\nDOCTOR: Thetris, please.\nAMY: Ugh! It, it tastes of... I don't know what it tastes of.\nDOCTOR: Poison, probably. How do you feel?\nAMY: Weird. Not good. Oh. I think I should sit down.\nDOCTOR: You're very pale, and trembling. Amy, I'm sorry, but I think you're reacting...\nAMY: Oh! Wow! Oh. It hurts.\nDOCTOR: Somebody please, get her some water.\nAMY: Doctor, it's all right. Don't look like that. It's all right.\nWEMBIK: Is she going to die?\nTHETRIS: I just wanted Mesca to be safe.\nAMV: It .. it... It tickles. It's okay. I'm okay, see? It's easy.\nTHETRIS: Give the anti-charm to Mesca.\nDOCTOR: It won't work as quickly on her, but it will work.\nMESCA: Tastes of curdled milk and mead.\nAMY: That's what it tastes of? Ugh! Where's that water?\nTHETRIS: Doctor, you have... you have saved her.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I rather think I have. I take it we can go now?\nTHETRIS: When she recovers, yes. Until then, you will be our guests.\nLIEUTENANT: Thetris?\nTHETRIS: Excuse me, Doctor. My lieutenant calls me.\nDOCTOR: I wonder if the segment's broken open? We don't have any time.\nTHETRIS: What is it, Lieutenant?\nLIEUTENANT: Ringer sensors tell us they've picked up spacecraft coming this way.\nTHETRIS: To the castle?\nLIEUTENANT: Best intercept course, yes. But they are not responding to communication protocols. That is an act of war.\nTHETRIS: Stand down the defences. They're expected.\nLIEUTENANT: They are the pilgrims?\nTHETRIS: They must be. Lady Zara would not lie.\nWEMBIK: We must not let them live.\nTHETRIS: Something is happening. Let me know if the pilgrims make contact.\nLIEUTENANT: Sir.\nDOCTOR: Please, we're not your enemies. We're just looking at the paintings. One of them could be what we're looking for.\nWEMBIK: But you mean to kill us. You're the ones who poisoned Lady Mesca.\nMESCA: We don't know that, Wembik. We don't know who did this to me.\nAMY: I do.\nTHETRIS: You know who tried to kill the Lady Mesca?\nDOCTOR: You worked it out?\nAMY: It was Wembik, wasn't it?\nWEMBIK: She lies. I admitted no such thing.\nDOCTOR: Amy?\nAMY: But you're the one who'd profit from Mesca being dead. You're the one who could have moved around the castle whereas we would have been noticed.\nDOCTOR: And I'm guessing you know a bit about snakes.\nTHETRIS: She wrote a monograph on handling them. Lady Wembik, I condemn you to die.\nWEMBIK: But I had to do it. Mesca's son can't be the King.\nDOCTOR: Er, does anyone hear that?\nAMY: You don't have to have the war now, do you, Thetris? As long as Wembik admits that she's lost.\nWEMBIK: Yes. We can agree something like that, can't we?\nTHETRIS: I condemn you to die.\nDOCTOR: Look, I think you should all listen.\nTHETRIS: Doctor, don't try to stop me.\nDOCTOR: But that was the sound of a spaceship.\nVALDIGIAN: Sentries! Sentries! There are alien creatures.\nDOCTOR: See? If only people would listen.\nTHETRIS: The pilgrims.\nMESCA: All are welcome to this castle, Thetris. It is a place of peace.\nWEMBIK: Yes. We must welcome them.\nDOCTOR: We can at least see what they want.\nAMY: But those are Martians!\nDOCTOR: Everyone take cover. They're really not coming in peace.\nICE WARRIOR: You will surrender. You will lay down your weapons and surrender.\nTHETRIS: What are they?\nAMY: They're Martians.\nDOCTOR: They're not Martians any more.\nICE WARRIOR: You will surrender to the Ice Warriors, or we shall kill all of you.\nDOCTOR: And they just happen to turn up where we happen to be. It can't be a coincidence.\nICE WARRIOR: The Doctor and Amy will surrender themselves or we shall continue to destroy your people.\nDOCTOR: See? Oh well. Best find out what it's all about. Mesca?\nMESCA: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Ice Warriors, they really don't like the heat.\nMESCA: Right.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Amy. All right, all right, we come quietly. Just don't harm anyone else. Hello. You're a long way from home.\nISSKAR: Yes, Doctor. We are.\nDOCTOR: I know that voice.\nAMY: Doctor, look. He got old.\nDOCTOR: And he's been promoted to Ice Lord. Hello, Isskar. It's been quite a while.\nISSKAR: Yes. But I would follow you to the end of Time, to repay my people's debt."

A rich, clever world of builders, craftsmen and farmers. There was bickering between individuals, unhappiness, crime, all those things. But there was also peace. Some cynics might say they were vulnerable, open to any attack, and yes, some space-faring race passing through the solar system could have simply wiped them out. But they were protected by their Gods. Gods no one would ever dare anger. Until the ground and sky betrayed them. We pulled the plug from a gravity well that reached all the way through Mars. A dispersal of so much energy so quickly caused earthquakes and hurricanes all over the planet's surface, and it lasted three decades. Almost all their buildings were lost - their artefacts, their writings... their lives. A few - those who could - got off-world, the rest - they struggled to find shelter.

      "searchable_dialogue": "DOCTOR: Humans named Mars after a God of War, a concept entirely alien to the Martians themselves. For twelve thousand years, life on Mars prospered peaceably. A rich, clever world of builders, craftsmen and farmers. There was bickering between individuals, unhappiness, crime, all those things. But there was also peace. Some cynics might say they were vulnerable, open to any attack, and yes, some space-faring race passing through the solar system could have simply wiped them out. But they were protected by their Gods. Gods no one would ever dare anger. Until the ground and sky betrayed them. We pulled the plug from a gravity well that reached all the way through Mars. A dispersal of so much energy so quickly caused earthquakes and hurricanes all over the planet's surface, and it lasted three decades. Almost all their buildings were lost - their artefacts, their writings... their lives. A few - those who could - got off-world, the rest - they struggled to find shelter. They fought each other for scant food and safe territories. But after thirty\nDOCTOR: years the energies were spent, and the ground and sky were still. What remained of the Martian people stepped warily from their shelters. They wanted to rebuild the world that had been lost. They would remake the cities and re-carve the canals if it took them a thousand years. They thought just through the effort of will that they could turn back the clock. But one Ice Lord, Izdal, had been watching the sky.\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Izdal.\nIZDAL: My Lords, I am of course grateful to the Minister for his reply. This side of the house has no doubt of his expertise, nor of his good intention. Yet the Government are wrong to say that turmoil is over. It is not the turmoil that has ended. It is our time here on this planet.\nIZDAL: I have studied the phenomena. I have collected the evidence. Our atmosphere no longer keeps out malign radiation. It will kill us all.\nICE WARRIOR: Folly. Folly.\nIZDAL: My lords, my lords. We have all seen the sickening children. To ignore truth because it is not in favour, that is folly. If I must, I shall prove this to you, to all of you. I shall face the dawn.\nICE WARRIOR: But if you are right, it'll kill you.\nIZDAL: My life, my life, it is given freely.\nISSKAR: That is what you did to us. It is important that you know the cost, the years of pain. I was there. I saw Lord Izdal step out into the new coloured morning. I saw him die. We are all in his debt.\nAMY: The atmosphere was poisoned?\nDOCTOR: It no longer shielded them from several kinds of radiation. The Red Dawn, they called it. Isskar, I've been to Lord Izdal's tomb.\nAMY: Doctor!\nISSKAR: You will not mock me.\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry, I really meant no offence.\nISSKAR: You destroyed my world, murdered my wives and our spawn, but you meant it well.\nAMY: We tried to save Mars. We tried to stop it happening.\nISSKAR: Look at what we have become. We are... parasites, prey to other peoples who give nothing of themselves and take what little is ours. We have had to do things to survive, take things not freely given. Fight even each other.\nDOCTOR: You adapted, you learned to fight back. But Isskar, the Valdigians, the insect people here, they were once refugees too. They're not your enemies.\nISSKAR: They harboured you.\nDOCTOR: We're not your enemies either. Like Amy said, we tried to stop what happened on Mars.\nISSKAR: You can tell that to my people.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, it was thousands of years ago.\nISSKAR: We cannot forget.\nDOCTOR: No, and you shouldn't, but look at you. How long have you spent in suspended animation just to make it out this far?\nISSKAR: No distance was too far to find you.\nDOCTOR: But you found us. Thousands of light years and millennia from Mars, and you just happened to find where we'd be.\nAMY: You did say they were clever.\nDOCTOR: Oh, they're clever, but not that clever.\nISSKAR: We had assistance.\nDOCTOR: Offered freely, was it? No Isskar, you've been used.\nAMY: You mean Zara?\nDOCTOR: I can't think of anyone else.\nISSKAR: She came to us, told us where you would be, and wanted nothing in return.\nDOCTOR: And you believed her?\nISSKAR: I wanted to believe the old ways could still apply.\nDOCTOR: And they could have, if you'd had the stomach for it.\nISSKAR: What?\nAMY: Doctor, you don't want to make him cross.\nDOCTOR: He should be cross! He should be furious! But not with you and me. We're not the ones to blame. And even if we were, what good would that do the Martians?\nISSKAR: We will have justice.\nDOCTOR: And then what? Are you really saying that now you've caught up with me you can rebuild things as they were? Lay down arms, go back to raising crops and pyramids, re-dig the canals and gift economy?\nISSKAR: That is the intention.\nDOCTOR: It's too late, Isskar. You've wasted too much time on this fool's errand. How many of you are left\nDOCTOR: who remember how it was? Just you. The Warriors who followed you won't listen to your stories of the old days. The only peace they understand is that won by conquest.\nISSKAR: No. Doctor, Zara came to us. She said she would...\nDOCTOR: I can guess what she said! But we're not your enemies, really.\nISSKAR: At my age, it is hard to change my opinion. But I think...\nTHETRIS: Doctor, get down.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, and we were doing so well.\nISSKAR: The insects think that that is an army?\nAMY: They're going to rescue us.\nDOCTOR: Not if we're caught in the crossfire. Get down!\nTHETRIS: Fire!\nMESCA: Press the left flank. The left flank. That's it. They're weakest there.\nTHETRIS: Doctor, you're all right.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think so. Amy? No, don't tell me.\nAMY: I grazed my elbow.\nMESCA: Keep the weapons coming! Keep the weapons coming!\nDOCTOR: You're looking better, Lady Mesca.\nMESCA: Thank you, Doctor. You were right about them not liking the heat.\nDOCTOR: What are you using?\nMESCA: They're for putting up scaffolding. If you tighten the spring they shoot their hot fins quite a distance.\nDOCTOR: Ingenious.\nMESCA: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: But you're not going to stop the Ice Warriors like that, only slow them down.\nMESCA: We'll see. Keep your head down!\nDOCTOR: Sorry! You're rather exposed yourself.\nMESCA: I'm fine. There's wounded you could see to.\nDOCTOR: You have to retreat.\nMESCA: They're not having the castle. Thetris, I want a unit moving up the left wall. We need to pin them in the doorway.\nICE WARRIOR: The heavy artillery is on its way.\nISSKAR: Good. Kill them all if you have to, but I want the Doctor and Amy alive.\nICE WARRIOR: My Lord.\nVALDIGIAN: Medic! Medic! We have many wounds.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, the Doctor's here. Oh. Here's a moral dilemma.\nWEMBIK: Help the others.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Wembik. You don't look happy at all. Let's have a look at you.\nWEMBIK: You should help the others.\nDOCTOR: I will do in a moment. Now, looks like the brunt of the blast was taken by this wing. Oh dear. There's quite a lot of nerve fibre exposed. That must be pretty uncomfortable.\nWEMBIK: I tortured your friend.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but not very well. Careful. You don't want to move too quickly, you'll do some real damage.\nWEMBIK: If the membrane is exposed, the wing must be removed.\nDOCTOR: That will cause you tremendous pain.\nWEMBIK: I can do it myself.\nDOCTOR: Amy, we need you over here.\nWEMBIK: Better now.\nAMY: Doctor, the Ice Warriors are pushing forward. They just got bigger guns.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nAMY: But we can't find the segment with a war going on.\nDOCTOR: Amy, I need you to help me move Wembik. We've got to fall back.\nAMY: But Doctor, she tried to tor...\nDOCTOR: Amy, she needs our help.\nAMY: All right. Wembik, put your arm round my shoulders. Okay. Now I'm going to lift you.\nWEMBIK: Ow! I won't run away.\nDOCTOR: Get her out of here, back down to where we left the Tardis. Anyone not fighting, you follow Amy.\nTHETRIS: We can't get any further. They keep bringing in more guns.\nMESCA: We've got to get them out of the castle.\nDOCTOR: You're not going to beat them, Mesca. Please, you have to fall back.\nMESCA: Doctor I gave you an order.\nDOCTOR: And I'm not under your command. I know the Ice Warriors, I've fought them before. Please, you're just going to kill more of your people.\nMESCA: I won't let them conquer us.\nWEMBIK: We'll fight to the last of us.\nMESCA: Wembik, you should be with the wounded.\nWEMBIK: Lady, permission to face the enemy.\nDOCTOR: But that's madness.\nAMY: I tried to stop her, Doctor.\nTHETRIS: We don't stand a chance, Mesca.\nMESCA: Permission granted. Valdigians, we charge!\nISSKAR: Fall back to the outer wall. Fall back.\nMESCA: Bear down. We need barricades built. That's not the last of them. We have to be prepared. The prisoners, round them up, treat them fairly, but shoot them if they try anything. Come on!\nDOCTOR: Mesca that was... that was brilliant.\nMESCA: Yes. Yes it was. But it wasn't me. Wembik?\nWEMBIK: Barricades. Good idea.\nMESCA: Wembik, you were incredible.\nTHETRIS: No one fought more bravely.\nWEMBIK: Well, you were quite adequate.\nAMY: They're all friends now.\nDOCTOR: It's having an outside threat. Gives them a sense of perspective.\nAMY: Aliens should attack more often.\nDOCTOR: Is this you being funny?\nAMY: Oh, I don't know.\nDOCTOR: Look, I'm delighted we're all getting on, but we need to get things moving.\nTHETRIS: You do not command here.\nDOCTOR: The barricades won't hold the Ice Warriors for long.\nMESCA: So what would you have us do?\nTHETRIS: Mesca, you heard what the Warriors said. This man is responsible.\nWEMBIK: + MESCA: No.\nMESCA: He's the solution. Doctor, tell us.\nDOCTOR: We need to find the missing segment. That's what all this is about.\nAMY: It can be disguised as anything.\nWEMBIK: Oh well, that's easy then.\nDOCTOR: But it will be leaking power. Something that symbolises strength or endurance, something that brings fortune.\nWEMBIK: We have nothing like that.\nDOCTOR: What?\nWEMBIK: Our grandmothers came to Safeplace with only the brood on their backs. We have no artefacts, no objects, just symbols, ceremonies, stories.\nAMY: Could the segment be disguised as a ceremony?\nDOCTOR: I think that's stretching the point, but... Wembik, you're not the only peoples on Safeplace.\nWEMBIK: No. So ask the other peoples.\nDOCTOR: It's got to be something in this castle. That's why we came here.\nMESCA: Doctor, we will help you look. I can spare you those wounded who are able to walk.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nMESCA: But even you don't know what you're looking for.\nAMY: I'll Know it when I see it.\nWEMBIK: That's what Zara said when she warned me about you two.\nDOCTOR: + AMY: What?\nMESCA: Zara, the spirit of the castle. She visits once a year.\nDOCTOR: Since when?\nTHETRIS: Since always.\nWEMBIK: And she has never found what she seeks.\nZARA: But it's got to be here. It's got to.\nWEMBIK: But Zara, if we knew what to look for...\nZARA: Oh, that'd be a brilliant disguise, wouldn't it? Maybe it should make a noise too. Wembik, it's meant to be hidden.\nWEMBIK: Well, then.\nZARA: But I'm meant to be able to see it! Oh, this is impossible.\nWEMBIK: Nothing's impossible. It's just more unlikely.\nZARA: And who told you that?\nWEMBIK: Mesca.\nZARA: The pretty girl with the gold mandibles?\nWEMBIK: She's not that pretty. And anyway, I'm better at equations.\nZARA: If you say so. She's the one all the boys look at though, isn't she?\nAMY: She's been coming here for years.\nMESCA: She helped us.\nWEMBIK: She advised us.\nTHETRIS: She said we were all in danger.\nDOCTOR: I bet she did, and warned Wembik about me and Amy. Hmm. Can I speak to one of your prisoners, Mesca?\nMESCA: If you think it will be useful. Thetris will show you the way.\nTHETRIS: If you command it, Lady.\nMESCA: And I do.\nDOCTOR: That's kind of you. Amy, you stay here. Work out a compromise between these two. We won't be long.\nAMY: A compromise between who?\nMESCA: I think she means Wembik and myself.\nAMY: Oh.\nWEMBIK: So, Amy, you know I have wronged you. Now, what do you propose?\nDOCTOR: So, this is where you put Amy, is it?\nTHETRIS: I would do anything to save Mesca.\nDOCTOR: Even things that do no good whatever, like torturing innocent girls? Yes, you must really love her.\nTHETRIS: I do.\nDOCTOR: The worst thing is that I think in your own way you do. Right. Hello, I'm as you probably know already, the Doctor.\nICE WARRIOR: Doctor, you will die.\nDOCTOR: Yes, one day I probably will. But I have a debt owing to the Martians, I gather, and I'm keen to pay my way.\nICE WARRIOR: We will not help you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don't expect you to, big strapping warriors like you, but I just want you knowing what I know. Share the wealth, if you like. Don't fret, it's given freely.\nICE WARRIOR: Go on.\nDOCTOR: Your Ice Lord Isskar has been seeing a woman. She's a similar-looking species to me and goes by the name of Zara. And however long she's been seeing him - and it's been a long, long, time - she's always got something useful. Information, detail, but something he can use, and she's made him some kind of promise. If he catches me and Amy, he doesn't just put everything right with his debt, Zara's counting on me and Amy finding something here, something powerful, something she hasn't been able to find herself. And Zara's promised Isskar a share in that power so long as he stops us taking it from her, yes?\nICE WARRIOR: But we already know this.\nDOCTOR: But I didn't until now. Thank you very much. Look, I'm going to sort out this mess and then you'll probably be free to go, so well done, you just ended the war. Come on, Thetris.\nTHETRIS: But what did that achieve?\nDOCTOR: It's a mistake to make theories before you've got all the facts.\nTHETRIS: And now you've got all the facts, have you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think so. The thing is to concentrate not on what Zara can do, but on the things she doesn't bother with. So, with that bit of intelligence squirreled away we make sure Amy's fixed things with Mesca and Wembik. Then we come to an agreement with Ice Lord Isskar. Then we sort out this missing segment. Then there's two more to go, and Zara to deal with. And all the time the segments are decaying, so at any moment the universe could collapse.\nTHETRIS: Doctor, it's not possible.\nDOCTOR: No, it's just not brilliantly likely, but if you've any better ideas about what we should do I'd really love to hear them. No? Well, get a move on.\nAMY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Amy. Sorry, sorry, it's quite a long way. Right, er, what was I going to say?\nAMY: I've no idea.\nDOCTOR: No? No, right. Ah well, yes. Er...\nWEMBIK: Is he always like this?\nAMY: I think so.\nTHETRIS: He has learned valuable intelligence.\nMESCA: Have you?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Well, valuable to me, but what I want to know is how you three have got on, hmm? What's the agreement?\nTHETRIS: There is an agreement?\nMESCA: Thetis...\nAMY: Mesca and Wembik are going to get married.\nDOCTOR: That's... not quite what I was expecting. Still, I do like a good wedding. The dancing, the terrible jokes.\nMESCA: Thetris.\nTHETRIS: Oh, I... I understand.\nAMV: If they're married then they're both mother to whichever boy becomes King.\nWEMBIK: We share all the ceremonial honours.\nDOCTOR: But I assume this means Mesca also has to vow fidelity, that sort of thing.\nWEMBIK: She can't always have everything her way.\nAMY: Oh. I thought it could just be symbolic, so you could both still see...\nTHETRIS: Marriage is a serious undertaking.\nMESCA: I have to make a commitment.\nAMY: I didn't mean it to happen like this.\nWEMBIK: We are both giving things up. It's her son that gets to be king.\nTHETRIS: I understand. And if the Lady Mesca agrees this solution, then of course it has my support.\nMESCA: Thetris.\nTHETRIS: Why, it is my duty, my Lady, for the people, for the peace.\nDOCTOR: You're a good man, Thetris. And it's often harder not to go to war.\nTHETRIS: We are still going to war, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What?\nWEMBIK: But we have an accord.\nTHETRIS: Not with you, my Lady. There are the creatures still on our doorstep.\nDOCTOR: Now look, I've been thinking about that.\nMESCA: Doctor, you have a solution?\nAMY: Of course he does.\nDOCTOR: Ice Lord Isskar? Ice Lord Isskar!\nISSKAR: Do you want to surrender, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not just yet, thanks all the same, but I would like a moment of your time.\nISSKAR: I'm listening.\nDOCTOR: No Isskar, we can't agree a peace shouting across a drawbridge. I would like a moment of your time in this castle.\nISSKAR: You don't really expect me to give myself up, do you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And freely, for the sake of your people. For the sake of the Mars you once knew. If you're scared of me and Amy and a few insects you can bring three of your burliest Warriors with you.\nISSKAR: Quiet. He does not take me for a fool, so why...? Jass, Kaskin, Iziksel, I have need of you.\nISSKAR: If you mean peace, you would put down your weapons.\nWEMBIK: Lower your weapons.\nISSKAR: Good.\nDOCTOR: Mesca, keep off me. This isn't the way.\nAMY: Doctor! Doctor, don't let them take me.\nWEMBIK: Stop this. We'll shoot.\nISSKAR: If one of your groups fire, I will snap the Doctor's neck.\nWEMBIK: Shoot them.\nMESCA: Stand down.\nAMY: (receding) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Don't take her, Isskar, I beg you. Take me instead.\nISSKAR: I only want to balance the odds. While my Warriors hold her outside. I am safe in here.\nDOCTOR: You could have taken me.\nISSKAR: So, what are your terms?\nMESCA: Not me. Him.\nDOCTOR: Thank you for coming, Isskar. I Know you don't trust me, but I think Zara's been running us all round in circles.\nISSKAR: She said you would try this tactic.\nDOCTOR: And told you not to listen?\nISSKAR: She suggested it.\nDOCTOR: But you're here anyway.\nISSKAR: I do not trust Zara either, but she is useful.\nDOCTOR: Oh, if only that were true. You should see the wake she's left. You arrived just as the Valdigians were about to war amongst themselves over what's just a ceremonial role.\nISSKAR: Symbols have meaning.\nDOCTOR: They do, and your people have given up everything they ever stood for.\nISSKAR: If you want me to listen to you, it is not wise to insult me.\nDOCTOR: I'm only saying what you said to me earlier. And all this because Zara's been running around whispering not very sweet nothings, popping up every few years just long enough to stir your frustrations and fears, appealing to the worst in you.\nISSKAR: You know nothing of what we discussed.\nDOCTOR: I can guess. Wembik, tell him.\nWEMBIK: Me, Doctor?\nMESCA: It's all right. Tell him.\nWEMBIK: Tell him what?\nDOCTOR: What Zara suggested you do.\nWEMBIK: She didn't... I didn't...\nMESCA: She suggested the snake venom.\nTHETRIS: You poisoned the Lady Mesca.\nDOCTOR: Wait, wait, wait! Thetris! You can't execute Mesca's fiancé, these things just aren't done. Wembik, you're going to get married, aren't you? About time to be open and honest.\nMESCA: Tell the truth, and we'll all be free of this.\nWEMBIK: Zara suggested I poison Mesca, and she showed me how it could be done.\nDOCTOR: You see, Isskar? Just the same as you. She brought you here, she hurt these people, and all because she couldn't find what she was looking for.\nWEMBIK: + ISSKAR: The hidden segment.\nDOCTOR: The hidden segment.\nWEMBIK: She searched everywhere.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure she did, but she is not as smart as some of us. You see, I know where the segment is.\nZARA: Where? Where is it? Tell me.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Zara. I thought that might get your attention.\nAMY: Doctor? Doctor!\nICE WARRIOR: You cannot escape us.\nAMY: But that's my sister. I want to hear what they're saying. And anyway, my head's clear now. All those tickly signals are all coming from one place. Oh, of course. That's why I got the mixed-up signals. Oh, get off! Get off. I can see the segment.\nMESCA: Open fire!\nDOCTOR: Mesca, no.\nZARA: It's all right, Doctor. Let them get it out of their system. It doesn't harm anyone.\nDOCTOR: Mesca, it's not doing anyone any good. please. She's protected by the segment she's already carrying.\nMESCA: All right. Stop!\nZARA: Thank you. Now, you were saying you know where the segment is? I can make you tell me.\nDOCTOR: You can try.\nISSKAR: Do not provoke her, Doctor. She has powers.\nWEMBIK: She can get behind your eyes.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know she can. She and Amy are easily influenced. They watch other people, pick up how they move and speak, and Zara's learned how to turn that round, how to make other people copy her. She's quite clever, but do you know what?\nZARA: What?\nDOCTOR: I know where the fourth segment is hidden, and I've only been here half an hour.\nZARA: Amy was right. You know this stuff.\nDOCTOR: I've got a special technique.\nZARA: Yes, which is...?\nDOCTOR: I'm not really stupid.\nZARA: That's not very nice, Doctor. I've done lots of clever things. This lot have been doing exactly what I want.\nISSKAR: I am not your servant.\nZARA: No? Isskar, put your pincers on your head.\nISSKAR: (effort) I... will... not.\nDOCTOR: See?\nZARA: Oh, you've spoiled it now.\nDOCTOR: Once they know what you're doing, they can resist it. Like you, they can make their own choices.\nZARA: Doesn't matter. They've served their purpose. Now, the segment.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on. How many centuries have you been coming here, and you still haven't worked it out?\nAMY: It was right in front of us all the time! Oh, wait till I tell the Doctor. What?\nICE WARRIOR: It is almost two minutes.\nAMY: What happens when it's two minutes?\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Isskar gave orders, and we have not heard from him.\nAMY: Something must have happened. No, I'm sure nothing bad. You don't have to shoot. Before you shoot me, couldn't you at least check?\nICE WARRIOR: We will. And if Isskar still lives, then so do you.\nAMY: Yes, well, that's only fair.\nICE WARRIOR: Warriors, forward.\nISSKAR: Doctor, get behind the barricades.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, you had this planned.\nISSKAR: Of course.\nMESCA: Fall back, fall back! Let them through!\nTHETRIS: Do not engage the Warriors. Fall back.\nZARA: You can't hurt me. I can barely feel it.\nDOCTOR: We've got to stop her.\nISSKAR: The weapons have no effect.\nDOCTOR: No, but we can't let her get away. Just need to choose the right moment.\nISSKAR: Doctor, you will remain in my custody.\nDOCTOR: What? Isskar, you idiot, let me go. She's going to kill us all!\nICE WARRIOR: Fall back. Fall back.\nZARA: That's right. You cower and run away.\nAMY: (nearby) Zara!\nZARA: Oh, hello, Amy. It's chilly out here, isn't it? Still, wnat an amazing view.\nAMY: Let me go. I've got to stop her.\nZARA: It's funny. It must just be the mountain air, but my head suddenly feels all clear, and that tickly feeling.\nAMY: I can't let her turn round.\nZARA: Oh! Oh, of course. The segment.\nDOCTOR: Zara, wait. Don't do this.\nISSKAR: Doctor, I will shoot you.\nDOCTOR: Get off me, Isskar.\nZARA: Too late, Doctor. I've found it. It's the castle itself. That's why it's so good for peace talks. It makes people want to find balance. Well, not any more.\nDOCTOR: No, wait!\nISSKAR: You will not escape me.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, we have to get out of here.\nAMY: Wait! No, you can't do this.\nZARA: I already have. There. I've got my three segments.\nAMY: But they're all... the Doctor is...\nZARA: Yes. He's trapped inside."

      "searchable_dialogue": "DOCTOR: Ah! Mesca? Mesca? Wembik. Thetris. Can anyone... Can anyone hear me? We've got... got to\nDOCTOR: try... try to keep ourselves together. Concentrate. Fix your mind on... on anything. Anything at all. Got to keep it together. Keep it together, Doctor. Come on, come on, come on, what's the first thing that springs to\nDOCTOR: what's left of your mind? Er - once upon a time, there - there - there were three little pigs. Yes, yes, yes. Concentrate on pigs. Pink skin and trotters and curly tails and... and... use the senses, what were they like? Er - what's small and hairy and smells of bacon? A hamster. No, no, no, no, that's not the story. Er - three pigs, and the first pig built himself a house from reeds, tall reeds in the marsh by the River Nile. Bent in the wind. Bent in the earthquakes. Bent and did not break. And the second pig built a tree-house, a raised platform, each of four corners attached to a skinny nimble zigma tree. And then it goes... it goes... Oh, come on, Amy, come on. I can't do this forever.\nICE WARRIOR: She destroyed the castle with her touch.\nZARA: Yes. I did, didn't I? I must have terrible powers. See? Your guns don't work on me either.\nICE WARRIOR: We must get new orders.\nZARA: Don't hurry back.\nAMY: Put it back, Zara. Put it back as the castle.\nZARA: Er, not sure I can. And even if I could, it's not a brilliant idea.\nAMY: You have to put it back.\nZARA: The segment was decaying, Amy. If I'd left it any longer it could have imploded, and taken all of us with it. So, I just saved your life. You could be a bit more grateful.\nAMY: There were all those people inside it.\nZARA: Yes. I can hear them in the crystal. They're not having a very nice time. Your Doctor... hmm, he's screaming.\nAMY: Stop it.\nZARA: I'm not going to stop it. And now I've got my three segments, I think... yes. I'm going to get the other segments too. Your segments. Like that one, in your satchel.\nAMY: But it's in another universe. You can't get it.\nZARA: Oh, Amy. What would the Doctor say? We have to try, don't we?\nAMY: You can't take it!\nZARA: I can if I use the power of the segments. I can feel them. They want to be one. They want me to have it. They're giving me the power to reach it...\nAMY: You've got to stop it! You'll destroy us both.\nZARA: But this is what we're for.\nAMY: But it isn't. We're meant to balance each other. Oh. More bruises.\nZARA: I'm... bleeding. I didn't think I did that.\nAMY: Zara, your satchel.\nZARA: But that isn't possible. They can't break.\nAMY: You broke it.\nZARA: Well, I'll... I'll just have to carry my segments, then. Or get a different bag. Where's the other one, Amy? I'm meant to have three.\nAMY: It's... Oh. I'm holding it.\nZARA: You took it.\nAMY: I didn't. I just have it. I think it just balanced out. Now we've got two pieces each.\nZARA: You're going to give me that segment.\nAMY: No, I'm not.\nZARA: I'll use my powers on you.\nAMY: You don't have any powers. And now we've got two pieces each, we're just both the same.\nZARA: Not the same. I've had practice. I can make you hand it over.\nAMY: I'm not going to.\nZARA: I can reach into your head. I can reach into your head.\nAMY: No!\nDOCTOR: [memory]: Peri? Can you hear me? Peri. Peri!\nZARA: You like him. The moment you saw him you did.\nAMY: He's sort of funny.\nZARA: No. You like him. You know.\nAMY: I do not. He's just useful.\nAMY: [memory]: See? I knew you'd know this sort of thing. Saves me having to look it all up.\nZARA: You're holding hands.\nAMY: We had to hide from the Ice Warrior.\nDOCTOR: [memory]: Oh no. He's seen us. Let me do the talking. Good afternoon.\nAMY: [memory]: Forty eight million billion, fifteen thousand and six.\nZARA: Oh, you are so loving yourself.\nAMY: I'm not. [memory]:Let them go!\nZARA: [memory]: Look at my hair. Zinc said I look like a Princess.\nZINC: [memory]: You know I'm married.\nZARA: [memory]: You know this is a better offer.\nZINC: [memory]: And Magda's quite accident-prone.\nAMY: (laughs) What was that?\nZARA: That was... that was me and Zinc.\nAMY: You liked him, didn't you?\nZINC: [memory]: And look - from here you can see the shockwaves, rippling through the canals and waterways.\nZARA: I could feel the power. I didn't need him any more.\nDOCTOR: [memory]: Zara, you can't leave with it, not yet. Let me get back to my ship. Maybe I can repair the damage then you can go.\nZARA: The whole world was swirling away and yet he's still in control.\nAMY: [memory]: He's trying to help. What's happened to you?\nZARA: That's me? That's what you see when you see me?\nISSKAR: [memory]: Perhaps a less arduous death.\nZINC: [memory]: Er... I'm sure we can do a bit better than that, huh?\nZARA: Zinc. Is he...?\nAMY: You killed all those people. You left us to die.\nZARA: That's me? That's how you see me?\nAMY: It's the power of the segments. You're not really a monster.\nZARA: Yes, I am.\nZARA: I choose to be this way. The counterbalance to all the Doctor's taught you.\nAMY: Zara, we can make it all right. The Doctor said we could fix it...\nICE WARRIOR: We have new orders. You will face a tribunal.\nZARA: I can't get into your head, Amy, but I do have other powers. Zinc's bracelet, for example. Like magic as far as the Martians are concerned. Would be stupid not to use it.\nAMY: Wait! Don't go...!\nAMY: Oh. Right.\nICE WARRIOR: You will not disappear into the air.\nAMY: It's a deal. But this is the segment that used to be a castle. I held on because I could hear the Doctor inside. Doctor? Are you in there?\nDOCTOR: The wolf reached behind the little pig's eyes and slowly peeled his mind. Memories, sensations. The whole house becoming semi-detached, it's being crashing down like a ton of bricks, I won't let it happen.\nAMY: [OC]: Doctor? Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Amy. Yes, I can... Yes, I can hear you. You have to hurry. There's not very much of me left.\nAMY: Okay. He's still alive in there, so I guess...\nICE WARRIOR: Wait.\nAMY: I'm going to free Isskar and the others too.\nICE WARRIOR: But Zara said it was dangerous. She said the castle would implode.\nAMY: The segments are decaying, but we don't know how long we've got.\nICE WARRIOR: You could release them but kill all of us.\nAMY: I can't leave them trapped in there. I can hear them screaming.\nICE WARRIOR: A warrior knows when to make sacrifice.\nAMY: But I'm not a warrior. I won't be. I have to save them if I can.\nICE WARRIOR: I could shoot you.\nAMY: You could try, or you could move your Warriors away from where the castle used to be. I'm going to try and put it back exactly as it was. Well?\nICE WARRIOR: Warriors, fall back.\nAMY: Okay. How do we do this?\nICE WARRIOR: It is imploding. You have killed us all.\nAMY: I'm not going to let that happen. Oh. Easy. Come on.\nICE WARRIOR: My Lord Isskar. Lord Isskar. Medic. Get the medic here.\nAMY: Doctor! Doctor. Say something. Anything.\nDOCTOR: Amy?\nAMY: Hello. I got you out of it, didn't I?\nDOCTOR: Before the wolf got me.\nAMY: What?\nDOCTOR: Nothing. I'm just going to... close my eyes for a moment.\nAMY: Here you go. I followed the instructions in the George Orwell book.\nDOCTOR: And he was quite an expert on tea. Thank you.\nAMY: And the Tardis seems fine. They're bringing it now.\nDOCTOR: The old girl can hold her own in the Vortex. Being stuck inside the segment was child's play. I think...\nAMY: What?\nDOCTOR: I think her being in there with me helped keep me together. It's why I'm not in such a state as the others.\nAMY: Was it really as bad as that?\nDOCTOR: You're aware, you can feel, and yet there's nothing to latch onto. You struggle to find a foothold, anything at all, and the more you reach out the more you unravel. Blown away like a house made of straw.\nAMY: The segments can be people, can't they?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I'd never thought what it must be like.\nAMY: It's horrible.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nISSKAR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Lord Isskar. How are you feeling?\nISSKAR: I feel my age, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It can catch you up like that. Your Warriors are very efficient.\nISSKAR: We've got nearly everyone out of the castle, and four of them have your box.\nDOCTOR: Handle with care, please. She's pretty venerable herself.\nISSKAR: And then you can transform the castle.\nAMV: I just press my hand against it and think nice thoughts.\nISSKAR: Such power. If it could be harnessed...\nDOCTOR: You'd all have much worse headaches. You know what it did to the capstone at the vast pyramid, what it did to Mars. It's not something you can use, Isskar.\nISSKAR: Even so...\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Isskar, it is done.\nDOCTOR: Right, I think that's our cue.\nAMY: You're sure everyone's out?\nMESCA: All accounted for. Thank you, Amy.\nAMY: Oh. It's nothing. This is easy.\nAMY: See?\nDOCTOR: Well, that's that, then. Thank you, everyone. Lady Mesca, it's been an honour.\nMESCA: You're leaving us already?\nTHETRIS: Doctor, there's going to be a banquet.\nWEMBIK: And the wedding. You can't miss the wedding.\nAMY: I've never been to a wedding.\nDOCTOR: Well, maybe we'll try to pop back, but there's still another two segments out there, and if we don't get after them, the whole universe goes crunch. Which would spoil everyone's special day. Come on, Amy.\nISSKAR: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, I hate goodbyes. Much rather just slip away.\nISSKAR: I have had your capsule put aboard my ship. You and Amy are coming with me.\nDOCTOR: What? Why?\nISSKAR: We still have orders. There will be a tribunal. You will explain your actions.\nDOCTOR: But you know we're innocent.\nISSKAR: You have to explain. We have to understand.\nAMY: That'll take too much time.\nISSKAR: If you do not obey me my Warriors will open fire on the Valdigians.\nDOCTOR: I thought we were all going to be friends.\nTHETRIS: We will fight you if we have to, Isskar.\nISSKAR: Then you will die. Our weapons are superior.\nDOCTOR: It's all right, Thetris. We'll go with him.\nAMY: But Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Amy, what choice do we have?\nAMY: We could make a run for it.\nDOCTOR: And leave Isskar to punish the Valdigians? I don't think we could. Come on. Let's get this over with.\nISSKAR: You will hand me the crystal, Amy.\nAMY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You'd better do what he says.\nAMY: Here.\nISSKAR: Good. Warriors, escort the Doctor and Amy onto the ship.\nMESCA: Doctor, I don't...\nDOCTOR: Yes, Mesca. We need her.\nISSKAR: Lady Mesca. Lady Wembik.\nMESCA: You're going to kill us anyway.\nISSKAR: I have no reason to. And I hope you can now enjoy the peace and richness denied to my people. We shall not meet again.\nDOCTOR: You hear that?\nAMY: The engine.\nDOCTOR: It's warping space, moving us faster than light. Mesca and Wembik's great grandchildren have already reached old age. Give it another couple of hours and...\nAMY: So we missed the wedding?\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid so. Although if we could get back into the Tardis...\nAMY: Doesn't that break all sorts of rules?\nDOCTOR: Technically, a bit. There'll be other weddings.\nICE WARRIOR: You will turn out your pockets.\nDOCTOR: All right, but this could take a little time. Oh, look. Chattering teeth. I'd forgotten I had those.\nICE WARRIOR: You will surrender the bag.\nAMY: My satchel? I don't think I should.\nICE WARRIOR: I will take it.\nAMY: Ow. You've quite a pinch, you know.\nICE WARRIOR: In here.\nDOCTOR: A cell? All of our own? Oh, you shouldn't have.\nDOCTOR: Hmm, some kind of resonance lock, I think. Seen this kind of thing before. Maybe if I think honourable thoughts. Maybe they haven't invented doors like that yet. Or the door just doesn't believe me.\nAMY: There isn't even a mirror.\nDOCTOR: I think this is really a store room. It's better than some places I've been locked up in. There was this Jelloid prison on Benk. Well, wasn't very pleasant.\nAMY: They're so stupid. They could have just let us go.\nDOCTOR: We're not finished yet. We've got two segments for you, just one more to go.\nAMV: Isskar took them. He's ruined everything.\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll have to get them back, won't we?\nAMY: How? Oh. You had a plan all along?\nDOCTOR: I'm upset you ever doubted. Amy, can you feel the segments?\nAMY: Yes. They're up on the next deck.\nDOCTOR: And you can feel the power inside them, can't you?\nAMY: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You could reach out to them, use the power, use it to open the door.\nAMY: Doctor, you saw what it did to Zara.\nDOCTOR: Opening a door, that's all I'm asking.\nAMV: It's the power, though. It's exciting. I saw inside Zara's head, what it did to her, what it let her do. I\nAMV: envied her, I wanted to be like that. If I use it, I... I might not want to stop. I don't think I can.\nDOCTOR: You're not your sister, you're your own person, and I have faith in you.\nAMY: Do you?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nAMY: I'm not real, you know. Yesterday I didn't even exist.\nDOCTOR: If you weren't real you wouldn't be blushing. You couldn't do that this morning.\nAMY: But if I don't want to...\nDOCTOR: Then you don't have to. I can't force you.\nAMY: And we just sit here and wait for the universe to end?\nDOCTOR: Or for Isskar's tribunal, whichever comes first.\nAMY: Oh, it's so frustrating. We don't have any choice, do we?\nDOCTOR: There's always a choice, Amy. The choice is yours.\nDOCTOR: Good. Excellent. Well done, Amy.\nAMY: No problem. Oh, this is sort of fun. I feel like I could do anything.\nDOCTOR: Well, we don't want anything. we just want the segment they took from us, then we can get back to the Tardis.\nAMY: Up here. I can feel it. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Okay. Be careful. We don't want anyone to hear.\nICE WARRIOR: Stop!\nDOCTOR: Oh. Er, hello. I bet you're wondering why we happen to be out of our cell.\nAMY: And honestly, we're as shocked as you are, but if you'll just let us explain...\nICE WARRIOR: You will come with us. You are expected.\nDOCTOR: Are we?\nICE WARRIOR: Yes. But I have orders to shoot you if necessary.\nDOCTOR: Well then, we'd be delighted.\nDOCTOR: Oh, hello, Zara. Good to see you again.\nZARA: Is it?\nDOCTOR: I was being polite. Nice bridge you've got here, lots of impressive-looking controls. So, which one of you gets to be Captain, you or Isskar?\nISSKAR: I command.\nAMY: He doesn't really think so, does he?\nDOCTOR: Shh, not in front of his Warriors. She must have promised him something really good.\nISSKAR: When she has her key, she will put things back as they were. Mars will be returned to us.\nDOCTOR: Like you can do that, turn Time on its head? Fight against it just by strength of will?\nISSKAR: There are many powers. Amy opened your cell.\nDOCTOR: That's right, even though you'd taken the segments off her. She's quite clever, really.\nAMY: Doctor, something isn't right. I can't feel my two segments.\nDOCTOR: Not now. So you locked us up just so we'd use the power. A practical demonstration. Zara's idea, I assume.\nISSKAR: Zara advises, but I command.\nDOCTOR: Is that right, Zara?\nZARA: This isn't about you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, I Know. Amy, I think Zara wants a word.\nAMY: You can't take the segments.\nZARA: Isskar already did, so they're mine whenever I want them.\nDOCTOR: But you want something else.\nZARA: I want you, Amy.\nAMY: What?\nZARA: You escaped the cell. Now you know what it's like. What it feels like to use the power. Now you know i's what we're meant to be.\nAMY: We can't use the power of the segments.\nZARA: Oh, but you just did. I want you to admit that you liked it. I want you to admit that you're just like me. Amy, we can do this together.\nAMY: I won't leave the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nZARA: But he's dead anyway. In fact, I'll make it easy. I'll destroy the ship and everyone on it.\nISSKAR: What? This is treachery.\nDOCTOR: Told you. She's been using you all the time.\nZARA: Oh, he's so stupid.\nISSKAR: I am a literate.\nAMY: No, Isskar. I can see into your head. I can see what you want. To hurt us, to hurt everyone, because of how we hurt you.\nISSKAR: My planet. My people.\nDOCTOR: It wasn't us, it was Zara. We tried to stop it.\nAMY: And if you loved your people so much you would have stayed with them, help them rebuild, help them remember what they used to be like. Vibrant, convivial and peaceful. But they're not. Not any more.\nISSKAR: I had to fight to survive.\nAMY: You've wasted your life looking for us, when you could have saved what Martians used to be, and you know it.\nISSKAR: Warriors, kill them.\nZARA: Now, you already know you can't harm me, Isskar. You already know I can do what I like.\nDOCTOR: Let's find out what she's after, Isskar.\nISSKAR: Very well. For the moment, stand down.\nAMY: I won't help you.\nZARA: But then you won't have the segments, so you won't be protected. So this is the choice. You either die with them, or you live and come with me.\nAMY: You're a monster.\nZARA: Oh, I already know what you think of me. But that's the situation. So choose.\nAMY: Well, there isn't any choice, is there? I'm staying.\nZARA: What?\nAMY: I won't be like you. I'd rather be dead.\nZARA: Fine. Then I'll just take your segments and go.\nISSKAR: No, you will not.\nZARA: You think you can stop me?\nAMY: Can you feel the segments, Zara?\nZARA: What? No, I... No. What have you done?\nAMY: He's put them somewhere.\nISSKAR: A strong box inside the warp drive. Outside Time and Space.\nAMY: I can't feel them.\nISSKAR: We let you get out of the cell, then closed the lid. Now it will only open to those of pure thoughts. So you cannot even coerce one of us to open it. Do your worst, Zara.\nZARA: You think that you can stop me? Destroying the ship won't hurt the segments, so I will just scour the wreckage after you're all dead.\nDOCTOR: Don't do this Zara, please.\nZARA: Is it me, or are those control banks getting warm? Goodbye, everyone.\nICE WARRIOR: My Lord Isskar.\nISSKAR: The controls are not working. Doctor, what can you do?\nDOCTOR: I'm not getting anything, from anywhere. It's all feeding back on itself. Zara could have gone back in Time and done anything.\nAMY: There must be something.\nISSKAR: She has wrecked the controls.\nDOCTOR: Looks like it. Isskar, where's my Tardis? We can all get into that.\nISSKAR: Doctor, we cannot.\nDOCTOR: Oh, what have you done?\nISSKAR: Zara said we shouldn't keep it aboard. If you escaped...\nDOCTOR: So you dumped it somewhere?\nISSKAR: We were in hyperspace.\nAMY: Doctor, it could be anywhere.\nDOCTOR: Well, it can't be helped now, can it? Isskar, you'd better get your Warriors off the ship.\nISSKAR: Yes, Doctor. Warriors, abandon ship. Computer, relay the order.\nAMY: We should go too.\nDOCTOR: I just need to shut down the warp engines, stop us bending space. If we don't it's going to ex...\nICE WARRIOR: Two to a berth. Two to a berth. This is not a drill. Faster. We don't have time.\nDOCTOR: I said shut the warp engines down, not crush them completely.\nAMV: There's a breach in the lower hull, I think. Oh, this is difficult to read.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, you have to get out of here.\nISSKAR: It is my ship.\nDOCTOR: Not for much longer.\nISSKAR: Very well. Then you must come too.\nDOCTOR: Amy and I need to get to the warp drive. We have to get the segments.\nISSKAR: They are not in the warp drive.\nDOCTOR: What?\nAMY: They were here. They led me up here.\nISSKAR: The strong box is under my chair, Doctor. I closed the lid when you came onto the bridge.\nDOCTOR: Very clever. Help me with it. It doesn't look much.\nISSKAR: It uses the same technology as our warp drive, to keep the contents outside of Time. The lock is empathic. You need to think honourable and pure thoughts.\nDOCTOR: Right. Was that me? I was trying to think of Hampshire versus Dorset.\nAMY: No. It was me. I'm honourable and pure.\nDOCTOR: And modest.\nAMY: Right. Got the segments. Let's go.\nICE WARRIOR: My Lord Isskar.\nISSKAR: Askan. Why do you remain?\nICE WARRIOR: There are no pods left, my Lord.\nDOCTOR: Brilliant. Can't you count?\nICE WARRIOR: There was severe fire. The pods cannot be salvaged.\nDOCTOR: There's got to be something we can do. Let me look.\nICE WARRIOR: It is hopeless.\nDOCTOR: It's not good, is it? All of them written off. But this one, shell looks intact, and the systems all seem just about working. It's going to have to do.\nICE WARRIOR: The door has buckled. It will not close.\nDOCTOR: No, that is going to be a problem, but I think we could... Look, can you get inside?\nICE WARRIOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Isskar, there's just room for you as well, and Amy. I think she can squeeze in too.\nAMY: The segments will protect me. You go, Doctor.\nICE WARRIOR: There is only room for two of us.\nDOCTOR: You stay where you are, Askan. Isskar, it's your escape pod, it should be you.\nISSKAR: I will not leave you to die.\nDOCTOR: Please, Isskar.\nISSKAR: It is only right. I am old.\nDOCTOR: With a lot of memories. You can tell your people what you remember. Say what Martians used to be. Maybe even turn back the clock. Isn't that right, Askan?\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Isskar can guide us.\nISSKAR: I have wronged you, Doctor. There is a debt.\nDOCTOR: I won't leave without Amy.\nISSKAR: There is no room and I will not take your place. You will take it, even if I must force you!\nDOCTOR: This is ludicrous! Take the escape pod!\nISSKAR: I will not leave you to die.\nDOCTOR: You're throttling me!\nAMY: Get off him!\nICE WARRIOR: Lord Isskar, forgive me.\nISSKAR: Unhand me, Askan.\nICE WARRIOR: You remember Mars as it was. We cannot lose your knowledge.\nISSKAR: Stop this. Stop this. The Doctor's life is as important as mine.\nDOCTOR: It is given freely. Amy, seal the door, seal it tight.\nAMY: I'm trying.\nDOCTOR: They're gone. They're safe. Thank you.\nAMY: The ship is going to burn up.\nDOCTOR: Yes, unless you can use the segments to fix it.\nAMY: I don't know what to do.\nDOCTOR: No. That's the thing with power. It's always easier to break things. Mending them takes skill.\nAMY: But you could show me.\nDOCTOR: I daresay I could, if we had the time. And even then I think you'd need to practice for that kind of precision work.\nAMY: We're going to die. Well, you are. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\nAMY: Where?\nDOCTOR: The bridge. The view is better up there.\nAMY: You're right.\nDOCTOR: I usually am. About what, in particular?\nAMY: The view. It's beautiful, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: We're on the edge of the Laboontic Constellation, heading at twice the speed of light, into that splendid red giant. Strongest centre of gravity that. Ooo, forty six planets orbit around it. Used to be forty seven, but there was a war with the Cybermen. Let's wave as we go past.\nAMY: You've got friends there?\nDOCTOR: I did have. I will have. I'm not sure when we are.\nAMV: If you could reach them...\nDOCTOR: I could say goodbye. I'm ready, Amy. It's all right.\nAMY: All right? We're going to crash into a star. There's still two segments out there, and who knows what Zara is doing.\nDOCTOR: But there's nothing we can do.\nAMY: But there's got to be something. There's always something.\nDOCTOR: Well, if you've any ideas?\nAMY: Oh well, if we had the Tardis...\nDOCTOR: But we don't. I hope the old girl's all right.\nDOCTOR: Whoops. That's the shields giving it their last. It's going to get rather warm.\nAMY: At least...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nAMY: At least the Martians get another chance.\nDOCTOR: Yes, maybe they can turn back the clock. Oh, that's a thought.\nAMY: What? What is it?\nDOCTOR: That's it. I know what to do.\nAMY: What? Tell me. I can help. What are you going to...?\nAMY: Do. Oh. That wasn't difficult at all. You had me worried.\nDOCTOR: That wasn't me. I didn't even have a chance to do anything.\nAMY: So who saved us?\nDOCTOR: Er, I think he did.\nAMY: Oh, no. They're not meant to get involved.\nBLACK GUARDIAN: Doctor, I hope you can explain.\nDOCTOR: Too late, Amy, I think he is involved.\nAMY: But he's... he's...\nDOCTOR: Yes. He's the Black Guardian."
