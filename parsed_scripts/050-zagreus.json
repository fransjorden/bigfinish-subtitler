We need to use clips from Storm Warning, Seasons of Fear and, of course, Neverland — including the last few lines of the Romana/Rassilon exchange. We should end on a complete reprise of the last scene of Neverland. Into theme and:\nCARDINAL: One hell of a racket — someone is striding along a corridor, kicking open doors, knocking things over, yelling angrily as he does so. This is Zagreus. We also, of course, know him as the Eighth DOCTOR. He's breathing heavily with the exertion. We should be scared of him. Bring up in foreground CHARLEY, running. Maybe she's fallen and can't quite get up, so it's a mix of scraping along the floor and half steps. She's out of breath and panicking. We're with her now, so the Zagreus noise needs to be background but still very noisy and angry.\nDOCTOR: Where are you, girl? What are you doing in my Ship?\nCHARLEY: (To herself — terrified) Doctor... no, please... oh, what's happened to you?\nDOCTOR: Girl? I demand you show yourself. (Beat — then in DOCTOR voice) Help me? Please? I'm so confused... (Beat — then angry again as the ruse didn't work) Curse you, girl!\nCHARLEY: (Still panicked) Zagreus... he said he was Zagreus, not the Doctor... Oh, I don't understand... We hear scrabbling as she finds an open door and shuts it behind her, muffling the kicking and yelling.\nCHARLEY: gets her breath back.\nCHARLEY: Must... find out what's... going on. What's made him like this? Suddenly the main door behind her is smashed open...\nDOCTOR: Zagreus was a nursery rhyme.\nDOCTOR: But now Zagreus life is mine!\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Please... noooo... She yells as she falls through something and we hear her cry drop away...\nCHARLEY: 2. SOMEWHERE.\nCHARLEY: We hear the TARDIS materialise. It's a bit of an unpleasant landing — it does so with difficulty but eventually settles. A few seconds of silence then it tries to take off again, but can't and with one final juddering materialisation noise, it stops very abruptly. Maybe it's that noise a car makes when you try and put it in the wrong gear, followed by the noise of the pistons ramming a twelve-inch hole through your engine. It's not a nice noise, but you certainly know your car isn't going anywhere again. Ever. That's the noise we hear that causes the demat to stop, because the TARDIS is well and truly fuc— well, anyway, it is broken.\nCHARLEY: 3. SOMEWHERE ELSE...\nCHARLEY: We hear sounds that suggest an English, possibly London, street circa the mid 1920s. Car horns. Street merchants. Perhaps a non-copyright bit of 'flapper' music can be heard from somewhere. Gradually we fade up on a newspaper seller yelling out a headline about the General Strike. We ‘focus' on a voice gradually getting stronger until it is 'foreground'.\nMOTHER: You are getting to be a very wilful young lady, Charlotte. I suppose it is the fashion these days, but I believed that you and your sisters had been brought up to be ladies, not Bolshies. (Beat) Well, come along, come along, he won't wait forever, you know.\nCHARLEY: (Unsure) Mo... mother?\nMOTHER: Yes?\nCHARLEY: Nothing, Mama... nothing. I do believe I was daydreaming.\nMOTHER: Yes that is the trouble with you, Charlotte. Too much daydreaming, not enough reality. It's that book I shouldn't wonder.\nCHARLEY: Book? What bo- oh. Oh. This. The Alice Compendium by Lewis Carrell... it's... it's the copy from Grandmama. Look, the inscription. \"To my dearest Charlotte. Enjoy this mild divergence from boring books about etiquette. Merry Christmas from Nanna Saviltride. Christmas 1919.\" I haven't seen this for years. I... I lost this though... left it at school... How can it be here now...?\nMOTHER: (Cutting across) Hurry now, child. Just around this corner.\nCHARLEY: Where are we going?\nMOTHER: Going? You know perfectly well where we're going. And why.\nCHARLEY: I... [seem to have forgotten, Mama. Please remind me. Again.\nMOTHER: (Sighs) I don't know what is inside your head sometimes Turnips probably. A head full of turnips, that's what Miss Lime wrote in your last report.\nCHARLEY: Mama, I'm sorry. Sorry I'm such a disappointment.\nMOTHER: Look at your sisters. Margaret is going to marry that delightful Earl of Medmenham and Romana is, I'm sure, very attracted to that sophisticated investment —\nCHARLEY: Romana?\nMOTHER: What?\nCHARLEY: You said Romana’. My sisters are Margaret and Cecilla. Peg and Sissy. Not\nCHARLEY: ‘Romana’.\nMOTHER: I'm sure I don't know what you are talking about, girl. Come, we are here. Ring the bell.\nCHARLEY: But where are we?\nMOTHER: For heaven's sake, Charlotte, we are at the surgery. Who are here to see the Doctor.\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nCHARLEY: 4. IRT. TARDIS CORRIDOR.\nCHARLEY: Shuffling feet. The DOCTOR is staggering along, breathing raggedly as he must do throughout his dialogue in this scene. He's not in pain as much as bewilderment, with occasional moments of clarity. At the start, he is also coaxing rather than barking out his lines.\nDOCTOR: Ship! Ship! Speak to me. (Beat) Ship? Please? (Beat) Pl... I need you. (Coughs) I need... (Beat, then he flares up for) Damn you, Ship! I... I (breaks into a coughing fit and then speaks weakly) Ineed... I need help. Your help. Anyone's help. I can't find... my way... I can't find... my way back to — now, that's odd. That's odd. Where was I going, Ship? Hmm? Well, go on, give me a clue, give me a clue. (Beat) Not one itsy bitsy lemon squeezy clue? (Beat, roaring) I am Zagreus, Ship, I demand you answer me!\nDOCTOR: 'Ching' (or whatever) as a door opens for him.\nDOCTOR: Now, that's better. Now, where are we? (Beat — lots of echo) No, it's, it's not... well, wherever it is I'm looking for, I'm fairly sure that this isn't it. Next?\nDOCTOR: ‘Ching’. This time we hear the sound of a horse race.\nDOCTOR: Now what are the odds on that? Of course, I prefer a steeplechase, but no, I don't think that this is it either. (Beat, angry again) Come on, you wretched machine, I am your master! You are supposed to do what I command you to. So get me to wherever I want to be.\nDOCTOR: 'Ching'. A faint sound that might be a breeze or the sound of a hundred people gently saying 'shhhhh'.\nDOCTOR: Books. Fantastic. I love books. Prefer books to people on the whole. What have we here, Ship? (Galling out the names as he picks a up book and discards it; they land with a thump) Masefield? No. Dickens? No. Kipling? Nope. Shelley? Nope. J. M. Barrie? Oh, no, no, no. Fleming? Nope — oh, wait, is this a first edition? Umm... no. Rubbish then. Why by here, Ship? (Beat, then darker) I said ‘why here’? (Beat) You are a very stupid Ship! (Beat, calmer) Of course, I'm a fairly stupid Doctor... Doctor. (As if rolling the word around in his mouth, getting used to the sound) Doc — tor. Doct — tooorrrr. No... not the Doctor. Zag-ray-ussss. Zag- raaaaaay-us. Zagreus, not the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: A Brief History of Time. (Flicks pages) It's blank, you stupid Ship. The pages are all blank. (Beat) Oh, but that's the point, isn't it? Very good, Ship. A history that isn't there. Because it's not been written, or because it's been erased. Wiped out. Decimated. Eradicated. Obliterated. Why do words like these come easier than 'not been written\"? Worrying, that.\nDOCTOR: 5. SOMEWHERE ELSE AGAIN. We're in a waiting room. We can hear a cricket match being relayed over a tinny radio. Someone's coughing. A receptionist is talking quietly to a patient, directing them to take a seat.\nCHARLEY: Why are we here, Mama?\nCHARLEY: MOTHER To find out what is wrong with you, Charlotte.\nCHARLEY: Is there something wrong with me?\nMOTHER: That's what we're going to find out.\nCHARLEY: I feel sure that if there was something wrong with me, I should know about... of course, it may be that the thing that's wrong with me stops me knowing there's anything wrong with me in the first place, and so how curious this all is — one would think I must know my own mind, but perhaps not, perhaps part of me knows but another part of me doesn't want to know and being the dominant side of me it wins, and therefore I don't know that I am truly ill and in need of a doctor... so perhaps I should see this doctor after all and find out whether I am indeed an ill person who believes herself to be well or a well person who believes herself to be sick. (Beat) Oh, dear, what nonsense I'm talking.\nMOTHER: Indeed.\nRECEPTIONIST: Lady Pollard? The Doctor will see you now in Room Forty. You and your delightful little bunny.\nCHARLEY: Bunny? I'm not a —\nMOTHER: Hush, child, here's a carrot. It's that book's fault. You and your White Rabbit. 'Oh, I wish a White Rabbit would take me down into Wonderland,’ you used to say. Ridiculous book, full of nonsense.\nCHARLEY: But, Mama, it's my favourite and —\nMOTHER: Do be quiet, Doctor Zagreus is a very busy man. Eat your carrot.\nCHARLEY: But, Mama! I'm not a rabbit! I'm a girl. Your daughter!\nMOTHER: Hush!\nCHARLEY: You know, I'm sure I've seen that receptionist before.\nMOTHER: Ah... the door to the Doctor's office seems to be locked. We appear to be kept out.\nCHARLEY: Ask the receptionist. I'm just a bunny-wunny. Apparently.\nMOTHER: Why would Doctor Zagreus want to keep us away? I'm sure it's something you have done, Charlotte. Bound to be your fault.\nCHARLEY: Mother, are you aware you appear to have grown ears? And whiskers. And... let me see... yes, a little cotton tail. Something's not right here at all.\nMOTHER: Carrots. Eat your carrots.\nCHARLEY: Zagreus? I know that name. Doctor Zagreus. Won't let us in? Won't let me in?\nCHARLEY: We hear a key turning in a quite complicated lock, then finally the door opens. It creaks slowly and over dramatically but ends with the 'ching' of the TARDIS doors we heard earlier.\nMOTHER: Ah, Doctor, she won't eat her carrots you know. I keep telling her. And lettuce. And bran. And she keeps looking at fobwatches in shop windows and —\nCHARLEY: (Cutting her off) Oh, hello. You're not Doctor Zagreus, are you? I wasn't expecting to find you here.\nBRIGADIER: Good to see you again, Miss Pollard. Welcome to your insanity.\nBRIGADIER: Thuds of books being tossed around at intervals. After a few seconds...\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR The answer must be here, Ship. It has to be. I mean, this is a library. The answers are always in a library. So why can't I find the answers? Ship? Ship?\nBRIGADIER: We should realise at this point that the 'shhhhh' sounds have become a drawn out 'yes'. Note to post- production guys: think Meglos, where the chanting of 'Ti' was indistinguishable from the atmospherics and music.\nBRIGADIER: The 'yes' finally configures into:\nVOICE: Yes, it does seem rather a shame, doesn't it, old chap?\nDOCTOR: Who's there? (Beat then calling) Hello? I can barely hear you. Why can't I hear you? (To himself) Or see you. Or know who you are. (Calling) Ship? Are we alone?\nVOICE: Yes, well wait a moment.\nDOCTOR: (Calling) I can just about hear you, old man. Your voice seems... familiar. Do I know you? (To himself) For that matter, do I know me?\nVOICE: That's it, now...\nVOICE: The VOICE breaks up and echoes around the library, getting louder and louder until the DOCTOR cries out in pain.\nDOCTOR: Stop it! Please, the noise... it's hurting me.\nVOICE: I know, but there's no reason for it.\nDOCTOR: Then stop it.\nDOCTOR: The noise cuts out.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now, who are you — no wait, first things first, where are you? I can't always make out what you're saying.\nVOICE: (Clears throat) Oh, no, sorry, I should move. (Beat) Right, go on.\nDOCTOR: That's no better, but never mind. Can you help me? You see, I'm in a bit of a state. I think I may be losing my mind. (Beat) Hello? Am I going mad?\nVOICE: I'm afraid so.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I see. Well, thanks for nothing. It's my Ship, isn't it? Doing this? Putting us in contact? I think I've worked that much out. But who are you?\nVOICE: I'm who you should be!\nVOICE: Usual FX broken up by what needs to become a familiar whooshing sound as if GHARLEY and the\nBRIGADIER: are walking through space/time barriers between there and here. Think the Stargate effect.\nBRIGADIER: CHARLEY The console room! We're in the TARDIS!\nBRIGADIER: _ So it would appear, Miss Pollard.\nBRIGADIER: CHARLEY And you. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Retired, of course.\nBRIGADIER: _ So it would appear, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: But why are you here? I mean, in the TARDIS? No, wait a minute, why are we here anyway? A moment ago I was with my mother in Harley Street. Oh, and then she decided I was a rabbit.\nBRIGADIER: Memories, Miss Pollard. Clutching at straws, y'see.\nCHARLEY: I'm not sure I follow.\nBRIGADIER: You had a pet rabbit once.\nCHARLEY: Mopsy. As in Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-Tail and Peter.\nBRIGADIER: Memories are important, Miss Pollard. Some say that we're little more than the product of a lifetime's memories. Time Lords even more so.\nCHARLEY: (Piecing it together) Time Lords! The Doctor, of course. Where is he?\nBRIGADIER: _ Elsewhere. For now. He has done something incredibly brave.\nCHARLEY: Yes?\nBRIGADIER: ~~ What do you recall of Sentris? Of anti-time?\nCHARLEY: That awful woman with my face?\nBRIGADIER: _ Indeed.\nCHARLEY: She was using me, to take her anti-time bomb back to Gallifrey. (Beat, then in awe) I remember... the pain... the transformation... it hurt so much. (Deep breath) But then — then I was nowhere.\nBRIGADIER: Nowhere?\nCHARLEY: Just... floating. I could see the galaxies... stars... the universe. Oh, Brigadier, it was beautiful! I can't explain it but I felt as if I could reach out and touch anything. Everything. (Beat) I'd forgotten all this, and about the TARDIS and the Doctor until just now. What happened here? Why's it all scorched and burned and hollow?\nBRIGADIER: _ That was his bravery, Miss Pollard. That was the nature of his sacrifice!\nDOCTOR: Sacrifice? Me? Sounds unlikely. Sounds more the Doctor's bag than mine. VOICE The inscrutable Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you see, I'm not the Doctor. (Angry) 1 AM NOT THE DOCTOR! I am Zagreus\nDOCTOR: — Iam he who sits inside your head, he who... who... he who... does something else and then eats bread... no, no, that can't be right...\nVOICE: It seems you've had parts of your memory altered.\nDOCTOR: It would seem so. So, who are you anyway? Why are you here trying to help me? Although, to be honest, I think it's only fair that I point out to you that you are in fact confusing me further.\nVOICE: Ooh, sorry, but that's the way it has to be.\nDOCTOR: Something drew me here. Here to this library full of books with no words and strange disembodied voices talking nonsense. That's you, by the way.\nVOICE: Right.\nDOCTOR: So long as you know. (Beat) Am I supposed to find something in here? Some kind of clue as to who you are? Or who I am perhaps?\nVOICE: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I see. Any chance of a clue?\nDOCTOR: Another book thumps to the floor.\nDOCTOR: Hang on. (Beat, then flicking pages) This one's blank, too. Another thump, then another.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. Up there, yes? All these books came from up there, on the top shelf.\nVOICE: Good.\nDOCTOR: So you want me to climb up and fetch something, yes? Something your telekinesis or\nDOCTOR: whatever can't shift down here where, frankly, it'd be a lot easier to read. (Beat) I see. All right. Steps? Steps? (Library steps trundle across room) Steps. Thank you. (He climbs steps) Hmm... not sure I can reach all the way. Maybe... (with effort) if I stretch a little further...\nVOICE: It's not going to work you know.\nDOCTOR: No. No, it's not. Should I climb up?\nVOICE: That's better.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you are too kind with your encouragement. (Begins climbing, unsteadily\nDOCTOR: perhaps. Occasional book drops to the floor) Oops. Sorry, book. (Callinig) How much further up, it's difficult to see where I’m going when it's on a vertical and I'm trying not to fall.\nVOICE: Hands there, wrists on, on the edges. This left foot back, and that one out.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see.\nDOCTOR: VOICE The wrists just where they are. That one slightly forward and that one slightly back.\nDOCTOR: I'm not... a contortionist you know... ahh... I see. Is this the one you wanted?\nVOICE: That, that is in the wrong place, isn't it, completely.\nDOCTOR: I don't know! (Beat) Umm... How to Boil an Egg. Well, yes, probably should be in the cookery section rather than fiction. Oh, well. Bye bye, book.\nDOCTOR: It drops to the floor.\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me what I'm looking for?\nVOICE: No, I can't.\nDOCTOR: How far along?\nVOICE: Two... three...\nDOCTOR: Got it! Hmmm... it won't budge. (To himself) Which explains why you couldn't\nDOCTOR: chuck it around, my disembodied friend. (Galling) I'm trying to get it... umm... it appears to be The Alice Compendium by Lewis Carroll. Now that's odd — it's not blank. Why in a library full of empty books is this one full of words and (flicks pages) at a quick glance, pretty much the right words. Except here, at the front. There's an inscription. \"To my dearest —' Hmmm, I can't read that, can't focus on that one word. Anyway, 'Enjoy this mild —' no, another word I can't see. Anyway, ‘blah blah blah, Merry Christmas from Nanna Saviltride, Christmas 1919\". (Sigh) Wonder who Nanna Saviltride was. No grandmother from my side of the family, I'm positive. Why couldn't it have been something tremendously exciting, or rare, or unusual or...\nDOCTOR: There is a sudden click and with an almost exaggerated creak what sounds like half the bookcase swings open slowly.\nDOCTOR: Fantastic! A secret passage. Of course, it's a library, all libraries have secret passages in. Hey, there's a light ahead. (Beat) I suppose you want me to walk towards it?\nVOICE: Well, there's no time like the present.\nDOCTOR: No time... no time... time... time... TIME! Anti-time! I remember!\nVOICE: Talk me through it.\nDOCTOR: I... no, no... the Doctor was in the TARDIS. This TARDIS, materialising it around\nDOCTOR: the casket of anti-time! Yes, I remember!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY And so when the time station exploded, all the anti-time Sentris had brought through, plus her and all those she'd consumed, were obliterated?\nBRIGADIER: _ Indeed, Miss Pollard. And absorbed by both the Doctor and his TARDIS.\nCHARLEY: He hit me.\nBRIGADIER: _ [beg your pardon?\nBRIGADIER: CHARLEY The Doctor, he hit me. Said he was Zagreus, not the Doctor, which frankly is just as well as I rather think that if the Doctor had hit me I should have been somewhat crosser than I was. Am. Was.\nBRIGADIER: _Isee. And then?\nBRIGADIER: CHARLEY And then he yelled a lot.\nBRIGADIER: DOCTOR And when I'd finished trying to shut her up, she ran away and I stumbled out after her. At least I think I did. Or perhaps it was just a dream...\nVOICE: Well, most of it was real.\nDOCTOR: I was afraid you'd say that. Who is she? And where is she now?\nVOICE: You know something?\nDOCTOR: You can't help me. No, thought not. Still, you showed me the secret passageway, so I\nDOCTOR: suppose I'd best find out where it goes. (Beat) Of course as this is my Ship — at least I think it's my Ship, don't know who else's it could be, and it does seem awfully familiar... Anyway, if this is my Ship, I rather think I ought to know about this secret passage. So why don't I?\nVOICE: Yes... yes, well, now it's time to look to the future. DOCTOR The future? And that's in the light down there?\nVOICE: So, you go down.\nDOCTOR: Down to what? Is it a mission? A task? A Holy Grail that needs to be found, or a\nDOCTOR: damsel in distress or... or... or is it something more prosaic? Will I find the truth in the light, is that it? Is that my mission?\nVOICE: You know something, I think that you need me to complete it.\nDOCTOR: You know, I think I don't. I think I know what you are now. You're this Ship, aren't you?\nVOICE: Well, oh, no, sorry.\nDOCTOR: Pulling something from your mind, from your past, but with all the holoprojectors on\nDOCTOR: board, all this technology, why can't you manifest properly? Why just a voice, eh? (Beat) Because... because you're dividing your power up — there's another voice elsewhere, isn't there? Same voice or someone totally different? Helping... helping that human girl, Charley or whatever she's called.\nVOICE: Good.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Ship. I'm going now (deliberately melodramatic) into the light! Goodbye. (Beat, then quieter) Goodbye. (Beat) Doctor.\nBRIGADIER: Well, Miss Pollard, that is a tall story.\nCHARLEY: Don't say it like that! You sound just like my mother.\nBRIGADIER: Like your mother? Is this your mother, Miss Pollard?\nBRIGADIER: Under this, we hear our whooshing Stargate effect start up.\nMOTHER: Pollard, Lady Louisa Pollard. My daughter is... (as if embarrassed) Charlotte.\nHEADMISTRESS: Isee.\nCHARLEY: Mama?\nHEADMISTRESS: Well, of course you have to understand Lady Pollard that your daughter is quite a wilful young lady.\nMOTHER: I am aware of that, Miss Lime. Now I have just driven up from Winchester, and I am decidedly tired. Kindly get to the point. If there is one?\nCHARLEY: Gosh, Mama, I didn't know you had it in you!\nCHARLEY: HEADMISTRESS The point, Lady Pollard, is that young Charlotte has absconded.\nCHARLEY: Beat.\nMOTHER: I do beg your pardon?\nHEADMISTRES: _ She was discovered to be missing earlier this morning. However, we believe we know where she is.\nMOTHER: I see. And where is that?\nHEADMISTRESS: I Cardington.\nMOTHER: I am not an atlas, Miss Lime.\nHEADMISTRESS: It is in Bedfordshire. Where the R101 is due to make her maiden voyage. Charlotte has displayed an... enthusiasm for the (with distaste) craft.\nMOTHER: I see. (Beat) And how have my other daughters taken the news of their sister's ‘absconding\"?\nMOTHER: HEADMISTRESS The news...?\nMOTHER: Miss Lime, Charlotte is wilful, disobedient and has little regard for authority. I suspect she takes after me in that. However she is also intelligent, resourceful and more than capable of getting to Bedfordshire and back quite safely. I'm only surprised that she has allowed her disappearance to become noticed. My other daughters however... well, perhaps they share more of their father's characteristics. One imagines they are mewling like kittens at her disappearance.\nHEADMISTRESS: Well, as I understand it, your youngest...\nMOTHER: Cecilia...\nCHARLEY: Hurrah! She remembered her this time!\nHEADMISTRESS: §Is upset, whilst your other daughter...\nMOTHER: Sentris.\nCHARLEY: Margaret! Oh, honestly, Mama!\nHEADMISTRESS: Sentris is threatening to organise search parties.\nMOTHER: How commendable. There's hope for her yet. So tell me, Miss Lime, before I go to the governors and ask them to consider whether or not this finishing school is being correctly administered by a (as if looking the HEADMISTRESS up and down) a dowdy spinster who cannot seem to avoid losing one eighteen-year-old out of, oh, what, thirty pupils? Thirty-two maybe — tell me, what are you going to do about my missing daughter?\nMOTHER: The last few words slow to a stop as though time as been halted.\nBIGADIER: There you have it, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: I never knew... never realised...\nBRIGADIER: What?\nCHARLEY: How much, well, respect she has for me. (Beat) Did this really happen, or is this just one of the TARDIS's hollow projectiles — or whatever it is they're called?\nBRIGADIER: It is both, Miss Pollard. This Ship is unstable right now. As its this internal dimensions have become more fluid than usual the line between projection and reality has blurred. So we can enter these projections more or less at will: observe and, with a slight adjustment, interact with them. No one would recognise us for who we really are.\nCHARLEY: Why would we want to do that?\nBRIGADIER: _ Because it may be the only way for us to learn what has happened to the Doctor — and whether we can cure him of this ailment called Zagreus.\nBRIGADIER: Bring up a pulsing energy beat, almost like a heartbeat but one that crackles with energy (be careful not to make it the same crackle as anti-time from Neverland or the poor listeners might be understandable confused!). Imagine there's a gyroscope at its heart, so it has that slightly off-kilter but regular drone within it. Paul McGann obviously plays both parts here, but Zagreus is as nasty as they come.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Fascinating... absolutely fascinating...\nZAGREUS: What is it, Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: Oh hello wondered when I'd hear from you. Two noises in one head, bound to case\nDOCTOR: problems. Do you know what this is?\nZAGREUS: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well, thank you for your help. Run along now, you must have some history to rewrite, or some legends to live up to.\nZAGREUS: You know who I am?\nDOCTOR: I know who you are meant to be, but the trouble is, you don't actually exist.\nZAGREUS: I am here, however.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, that I imagine is because of this great lump of... well whatever it is. Let's\nDOCTOR: call it Bright Shiny Ball of Whatever, yes? And Big Bright Shiny Ball of Whatever — notice I added an additional adjective to go with the tautological noun — grammar was never my strong suit. Or perhaps it wasn't yours?\nZAGREUS: Do you know what the light represents?\nDOCTOR: Do you? (Beat) The Ship guided me here, having created this little pocket of tranquillity where I could sit down and relax. For everything has to have an opposite — for the anti-time to be dominant, there has to be a smidgen of positive time left, otherwise we'd have been consumed by now. This morsel of untouched Ship is a safety valve. Like a pressure cooker, it needs to let off steam.\nZAGREUS: So what are you going to do with the anti-time energy pervading the rest of this ‘craft — and, indeed, yourself?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. You're me, what do you suggest?\nZAGREUS: Destruction. Total annihilation of the cosmos. You... we... have the power.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but what's the point? You destroy the universe a wake up twenty minutes later\nDOCTOR: and think, 'Bother! I forgot to go and see the cubist exhibition of Potrellis Major. Or check up on the\nDOCTOR: Oracle on KS-159. Or nip back and find out who really shot JFK'— someone on blamed me, you know, but I'm fairly certain all of me were elsewhere. Destroying universes is so passe and you always regret it.\nDOCTOR: ZAGREUS And what about your companion?\nDOCTOR: My companion? (Beat) Charley! Of course! How could I have forgotten about Charley? (Beat) Ah, now there's a; conundrum. I have here to find Charley, you take me over again. Stay here, she's in trouble. Tell me, Zagreus — what would you do?\nDOCTOR: The wind is whistling- think of those old black and white Avengers like Town of No Return. Desolate, uninviting. Stargate FX and...\nCHARLEY: (Momentarily giddy) Whoaa... Now where are we?\nBRIGADIER: Don't you know?\nCHARLEY: Well, it's cold... and those buildings are... not very attractive.\nBRIGADIER: Ah, the military mind. Practical. Prefabricated And far from pleasing to the eye. (To himself) Could this really be here the Divergence occurs?\nCHARLEY: Sorry?\nRIGADIER: Nothing.\nCHARLEY: What aren't you telling me? I'm not stupid, you know, Brigadier, can — (Beat) Oh. Oh, of course, I am being stupid. You're not the Brigadier, are you? Not remotely.\nBRIGADIER: Well done, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: You're my very own White Rabbit, aren't you?\nBRIGADIER: Not sure what you mean.\nCHARLEY: You've been reading my mind, all that stuff going to the Doctor in Harley Street, with my copy of Alice. You're using the ideas in that to get to my memories.\nBRIGADIER: Is that what I've been doing? Sorry. Hope you don't mind.\nCHARLEY: You're the TARDIS, aren't you!\nBIGADIER: Yes.\nCHARLEY: Ah-ha!\nCHARLEY: BRIGADIER And no.\nCHARLEY: Oh.\nBRIGADIER: = Something has happened, Miss Pollard. Something has affected both myself — the TARDIS, if you like — and the Doctor. You seem I be the only thing aboard, not tainted by whatever it is.\nCHARLEY: Because I wasn't here when it happened? Whenever the Doctor did whatever it was that he did to stop Sentris?\nBRIGADIER: Precisely.\nCHARLEY: I see.\nBRIGADIER: [don't think you do, Miss Pollard. I really don't think you do! Something... something terrible has happened. Parts of me are drifting away, my consciousness, my self-awareness is fractured and I'm having to find ways to help you. Both of you.\nCHARLEY: Both — oh, the Doctor. You're helping him, too?\nBIGADIER: As best I can.\nCHARLEY: But with you in a similar predicament well I can see that it's difficult.\nBRIGADIER: _ [arranged for the Doctor to be helped by an... an earlier Doctor — you are familiar with regeneration, yes?\nCHARLEY: Not entirely, but I've picked up the gist.\nBRIGADIER: This chap, the Brigadier, has been important to both of you.\nCHARLEY: He's the Doctor's oldest friend. Well, non-Time Lord friend anyway.\nBRIGADIER: _ Time Lords! No... no, mustn't involve the Time Lords.\nCHARLEY: But what about that woman, Romana? She could help She's the President, you know.\nBRIGADIER: I Emphatically not. The Time Lords can't help. We might infect them with... with whatever it is.\nZAGREUS: Enough sitting, Doctor. We need to find Charley.\nDOCTOR: If I move away from my safety net of glowing... glowing glowyness, there'll only be one of me again, and I've an unpleasant idea it'll be you in charge. Up here.\nZAGREUS: I am Zagreus, the one who sets all time a-weeping.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, that's rather the point, isn't it? You're not setting anything a-weeping, are\nDOCTOR: you? My own bewaffled subconsciousness has conjured you up so we can have a little tete-a-tete, but only whilst we — I'm here. Zagreus doesn't exist.\nZAGREUS: But that's just the delight of it, Doctor. I do now. By destroying the power of the anti- time casket, by absorbing it into yourself and your craft, you have brought me into reality. And whilst your Ship helped you earlier, I can feel its defences cracking, and the parts of me that are inside every wall, every floor, every atom of every particle, grow stronger and more dominant, just as they are in you.\nDOCTOR: I... we will be rid of you!\nZAGREUS: How? I'm not from this universe — I'm unique, I'm alien. I don't conform to your laws, your physics. And with your help, Doctor, I'm going to alter the state of your universe, make it suit me.\nDOCTOR: Won't that rather result in the destruction of everything else?\nZAGREUS: That's rather the point.\nDOCTOR: Now I can think, I can focus. The Time Lords called you anti-time, but you're far, far\nDOCTOR: more than that.\nZAGREUS: Anti-time, as Sentris told you, is the result of hundreds of thousands of living, breathing beings’ futures. And pasts. Wases and never-wases.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes — and between them they bore witness to a billion alternatives. (Beat) I can... see things. In my mind's eye. I can see me, thousands of mes doing different things in different places but all at once Alternative realities, or maybe this is an alternative and one of those others is real. You're part of me, can't you see what I'm seeing?\nZAGREUS: Always.\nDOCTOR: Look, there, I see myself on the planet Oblivion, facing race called the Horde. And there, look, a tiny reality where Gallifrey isn't a planet but a timeless diamond, drifting through the stars. I can see universe where the Time Lords have terrible mind-powers, and another where they have ceased to exist, time wound backwards to eliminate their every trace. A planet Earth where the Nestenes very nearly destroyed everything... and another Earth upon which I have plucked out one of my own hearts... but which is real and which are the alternatives?\nZAGREUS: There is no alternative.\nDOCTOR: You mean, no one knows which reality is the real one?\nZAGREUS: They are all real and primary to their inhabitants. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter. Who is there to care? They all exist, occasionally sharing moments and eras, the rest of the time, self-contained and unaware. But all are destined to end together. And very soon.\nDOCTOR: I'm scared.\nZAGREUS: Good. You should be.\nDOCTOR: What now?\nDOCTOR: ZAGREUS The mission you discussed earlier with your old self.\nDOCTOR: So I have to move. To leave this comfort zone.\nZAGREUS: Indeed. But you can always return now and again, re-establish your sanity if you want.\nDOCTOR: But you'll be in charge, won't you?\nDOCTOR: ZAGREUS Of course. You haven't the strength of character to do what is needed. I'm afraid you\nDOCTOR: need our parasitic co-existence to do what needs to be done.\nZAGREUS: And if we lose?\nZAGREUS: Time is undone, and I am sated.\nZAGREUS: And if we win?\nZAGREUS: I will be free of you and time will be my restaurant. Either way, I win and you lose.\nZAGREUS: The difference is, the second option gives others in the universe a chance. Now, shall we go? I've a cosmic menu to study.\nBRIGADIER: to play along.\nBRIGADIER: What now, Brigadier?\nBRIGADIER: We must let the story play itself out. And see what happens.\nBRIGADIER: Do you know what these clues are that we're looking for?\nBRIGADIER: Not at all. Ready?\nBRIGADIER: Ready. What time zone are we in?\nBRIGADIER: Time zone?\nBRIGADIER: Isn't that the term? I can see it's not 1930 from your ‘prefabricated’ buildings.\nBRIGADIER: I have no idea. But this time, this place — it's significant, I sense it. Let's go, shall we? And the people inside - they'll not see us as us?\nBRIGADIER: Indeed. They'll see us inhabiting bodies of people they would expect to see. Prepare\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: Should we hide?\nBRIGADIER: Why? He'll see us as someone he's expecting to see.\nBRIGADIER: (Slightly off, get nearer as he talks) Oh. Oh, good evening, sir.\nBRIGADIER: Good evening... ?\nBRIGADIER: Captain McDonnell, sir. We weren't expecting you until the morning.\nBRIGADIER: I see...\nBRIGADIER: Still, this gives you a good chance to see the Doctor at work.\nBRIGADIER: The Doctor?\nBRIGADIER: Yes, Driver...?\nBRIGADIER: Driver?\nBRIGADIER: Ah, Pollard. Driver Pollard. My driver.\nBRIGADIER: Of course, sir. Good evening, Corporal Pollard.\nBRIGADIER: Umm, yes. Hello, Captain.\nBRIGADIER: Well, I'd like to, ah, freshen up before we meet up with the, um, Doctor, yes? Of course. This way, Minister.\nBRIGADIER: Come along, Driver. Keep up with Captain McDonnell.\nBRIGADIER: Through here, sir. I can set you up with quarters in the officers' mess. Corporal,\nBRIGADIER: there's so few staff here, you could pick barrack at random and have total privacy.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL\nCHARLEY: Thank you. You're very kind, Captain. Now, I must get back to the Doctor. Sorry the accommodation's a bit rough, Minister,\nCHARLEY: we really didn't know you were coming down this evening.\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nCHARLEY: Perfectly all right, Captain. Goodnight. Sir. Corporal. Goodnight.\nDOCTOR: Charley? Charley? Where are you, Charley? I'm all right now! The Zagreus side of\nDOCTOR: me has been... been submerged. It's gone. I won't hurt you. (Beat, then plaintive) Please, Charley, I need your help Please. (Beat) Charley? (Beat then vicious) Yssgaroth curse you, girl, where are you? I\nDOCTOR: command you, be here! Now! (Beat) Bah! Useless girl (Beat — then normal) No... no, must keep him... it... under control. Sorry if you can hear any of this, Charley, but it's so hard... so hard to strong... not be consumed... if only there was something I could do... find someone to help me...\nVOICE: Let's see if we can —\nDOCTOR: (Interrupting) Oh, hello again... What words of wisdom do you have now? (Beat) Nothing. Thought so.\nDOCTOR: What is your obsession with this book, eh? Lewis Carroll a personal friend, perhaps? (FX: Flicking pages back and forth) Hang on though — yes! Now that's interesting. Don't you think this is interesting. I couldn't see these words last time, but the inscription clearly says \"To my dearest Charlotte. Enjoy this mild divergence from boring books about etiquette. Merry Christmas from Nanna Saviltride, Christmas 1919.' 'Charlotte' must mean Charley, and that other word I couldn't work out — pen. (Pats pockets) A pen, a pen, my kingdom for a pen... oh, that's nice where did I get that from? (Calling) Do you like lollipops, my disembodies friend? (Unwraps it and then pops it into his mouth — and speaks therefore as if it's there) Mmmm, mint sauce and onion gravy flavour, my favourite. Now, where was I? Oh, yes, pen. Here we go. D-I-V-hmm-hmmm-uh-hu... Divergence. By the way, Ship, I hate people who write in books. Don’t let me do it again, all right? Can’t see anything significant though. What about this other thing, this word that I don’t recognize. S-A-V-\nVOICE: Let’s see if we can do it this way round.\nDOCTOR: Oh, oh, thank you so much. (Beat) Ah. Now I’m rather scared.\nCHARLEY: Why are we hear? We’re supposed to be sleeping back in that other block.\nBRIGADIER: We won’t learn anything through sleep, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: All right, but why in here? What are we looking for?\nBRIGADIER: _ [don’t know. But I will, when you find it.\nCHARLEY: I find it?\nBRIGADIER: Miss Pollard, I’m an insubstantial hologram, created from the TARDIS memory banks. I can do nothing except manipulate the scenarios I create and protect ourselves into them.\nCHARLEY: But if we’re looking for something, some way to help the Doctor, you must have an idea what it is!\nBRIGADIER: Notaclue, sorry.\nCHARLEY: Great. So, again, where are we?\nCHARLEY: BRIGADIER The TARDIS, in other words, me, is trying to piece this together as quickly as I can.\nCHARLEY: And?\nBRIGADIER: Hmmm... Let’s see where we are.\nCHARLEY: Heavens!\nBRIGADIER: _ Fascinating.\nCHARLEY: ‘Ministry of War’. Oh, and this one says “Top Secret’. ‘Cardington’! Well, there we are, Brigadier!\nBRIGADIER: ~~ What’s that, Miss Pollard?\nCHARLEY: You’ve brought us to Cardington, where I first met the Doctor. But it’s not 1930 — now it’s somewhere where they store big wooden crates full of top-secret Ministry of Defence things.\nBRIGADIER: __ Indeed, so it would appear. However —\nCHARLEY: Shhh! Someone’s coming!\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL Oh, hell’s bells!\nFOSTER: What is it, Captain?\nFOSTER: McDONNELL Someone left the ruddy lights on. I mean, what is the point of posting messages all over the base about saving energy if some wretched navy is going to leave this overnight.\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nFOSTER: Yes, sir. If the Doctor’s work is going to remain unknown to the reds, then secrecy is of\nFOSTER: utmost importance.\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nFOSTER: Yes, sir. Draft another memo, Miss Foster. And imply there will be stiff penalties for anyone\nFOSTER: found ignoring me, is that clear?\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nFOSTER: Yes, sir, Now, which crates are we seeking out? The, umm, the ones from 1947, Captain. The Doctor wants everything that was\nFOSTER: collated in Hereford.\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: So are we looking at paperwork, or more?\nBRIGADIER: I have no idea, Captain. Hereford was before I was assigned here.\nBRIGADIER: Right. Well, you look down that aisle, I'll start over there.\nBRIGADIER: Yes, sir.\nBRIGADIER: (Whisper) Brigadier, they'll find us!\nBRIGADIER: (Whisper) If they do, not a problem. I'm the Minister of Something remember. (Off) Found them, Miss Foster. Think we might need some of the lads to help shift\nBRIGADIER: them. Dashed heavy by the look of it.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nFOSTER: McDONNELL\nCHARLEY: (Close) Yes, Captain. I'll go and — oh! Damn!\nCHARLEY: Gosh, what are you two doing here? Ah, urn, well, you see, I...\nCHARLEY: What the hell is...? Oh, good evening again, sir. May I ask, sir, if you don't mind...? What we're doing in here?\nCHARLEY: Well, yes...\nCHARLEY: What do think we might be doing in here, Captain? Well, sir, I know the Ministry requested full access... But?\nCHARLEY: ... Lunderstood that this room was still, well... Off-limits?\nCHARLEY: Yes, sir.\nCHARLEY: All the more reason for us to check it out.\nCHARLEY: Us?\nCHARLEY: The Minister's driver is here, sir.\nCHARLEY: Corporal Pollard? Why?\nCHARLEY: Because...\nCHARLEY: Because I am under orders to stay with the Minister at all times, Captain McDonnell.\nCHARLEY: Security and all that.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL\nCHARLEY: I see. Very good, all in order. Would you like Miss Foster to escort you to the\nCHARLEY: Doctor's laboratory now?\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: McDONNELL\nBRIGADIER: Yes, please.\nBRIGADIER: What?\nBRIGADIER: Sorry. I mean, yes, Minister, we would, wouldn't we?\nBRIGADIER: Absolutely.\nBRIGADIER: Miss Foster? I'll finish up here. If you could escort the Minister and his driver? Yes, sir. This way, Sir Geoffrey. Corporal Pollard.\nBRIGADIER: Thank you.\nBRIGADIER: Now then... crates one, two, three... and four. Oh, great...\nFOSTER: Permission to speak, Minister.\nBRIGADIER: _ Of course, Miss Foster.\nFOSTER: Are we secure, sir?\nBRIGADIER: — Secure? Oh, oh, I see. There is nothing Corporal Pollard is unaware of.\nFOSTER: (Breathes out) Good. Sir, my report.\nBRIGADIER: _— Go ahead.\nFOSTER: As requested by yourself, I have observed the base personnel, particularly those\nFOSTER: closest to Doctor Stone.\nCHARLEY: Who are?\nFOSTER: Myself, obviously, Corporal. Plus Captain McDonnell, the base s chaplain, Reverend Townsend, and his niece, Mary Elson.\nFOSTER: BRIGADIER And your observations?\nFOSTER: Captain McDonnell is an upstanding, well-trained officer In His Majesty’s army, sir. I believe him to be as honest and dependable as they come, sir. I don't think he's the spy.\nCHARLEY: Spy?\nFOSTER: Yes, Corporal?\nCHARLEY: I meant, are you sure you should say 'spy' quite so loudly?\nFOSTER: No one else is in this building apart from the Captain.\nFOSTER: BRIGADIER And the others?\nFOSTER: I believe we can discount Mary Elson. I have done a complete check on her\nFOSTER: background, and she is exactly what she seems the Reverend's niece. Her parents, the Reverend's brother and sister-in low, died in a car crash some three years ago.\nCHARLEY: Who does that leave?\nFOSTER: Reverend Townsend. (Beat) I know one isn't supposed to go on intuition, sir, but...\nBRIGADIER: It's all right, Foster, I encourage thought rather than rule books.\nFOSTER: Well, sir, I don't trust him. He's too interested in the Doctor’s theoretical work.\nFOSTER: Before helping with any experiment or practical demonstration, he requires a full and detailed history of that experiment. Why they are doing it and how it should work.\nCHARLEY: Sounds sensible to me, Miss Foster.\nFOSTER: Yes, Corporal, I'm sure it does to you. But my job is to be suspicious. The Reverend has... issues, I believe is the current parlance.\nCHARLEY: Such as?\nFOSTER: He claims his beliefs contradict the work happening here.\nBRIGADIER: _ He tries to stop it?\nFOSTER: Exactly the opposite. He encourages it and yet criticises. As if he can’t make his\nFOSTER: mind up what to believe, scripture or science.\nBRIGADIER: _ But clearly not both in harmony.\nFOSTER: Oh, no, sir. Why did the Ministry put him in as an observer?\nBRIGADIER: How well does he get on with the Doctor?\nFOSTER: Chalk and cheese, sir. They argue bitterly over everything. The Reverend challenges\nFOSTER: her every notion, causing the Doctor to check and re-check everything. It creates a somewhat hostile atmosphere.\nBRIGADIER: Nevertheless, as we are at the dawn of a new age of science, it seems appropriate that Doctor Stone doesn't just charge ahead and make mistakes.\nCHARLEY: Science without a conscience, not good.\nFOSTER: Yes. Thank you. Corporal.\nCHARLEY: Sorry.\nBRIGADIER: How long has Reverend Townsend been here?\nFOSTER: Eight months. He arrived shortly after myself. CHARLEY And how long has the niece, this Mary Elson, been here?\nFOSTER: Not long after. I have it noted elsewhere.\nBRIGADIER: You have done very well, Fos —\nBRIGADIER: They are interrupted by a massive sonic boom and a terrible tearing sound, like sheet metal being ripped apart but sheet metal a few thousand feet high!\nFOSTER: What on Earth...?\nCHARLEY: Gracious, what was that!\nBRIGADIER: (Quietly) At last...\nDOCTOR: What was that, Ship? (Beat) Ship? Something's happening, Ship, but the question would appear to be who is better suited to deal with it? The Doctor or Zagreus? I think I know the answer but I don't think I like it. Not one little bit. Ship, I think I need to get out from inside you, see where we've landed. To do that, I need to find my way back to the place I couldn't remember earlier. The control room! Yes, and you... you have a name? Bessie! No, no... sorry, that's not you. Got it! TARDIS! Now, how come I can now remember that, hmm?\nDOCTOR: Loads of noise, vibration, some experiment wildly out of control. Everyone's pitching above the racket.\nTOWNSEND: _ Doctor Stone! There! There, do you see... in all that's holy...\nSTONE: Hold it steady, man! This is overloading!\nTOWNSEND: _ [amtrying, Doctor, but it has gone right off the scale! (Beat) You always said this wouldn't happen!\nSTONE: Indeed, and we won't be able to ascertain why if you don't bring this back under control! Now!\nTOWNSEND: ~ (Beat) All right. Bringing down alpha-wave emitters... now!\nSTONE: Bringing down beta-wave emitters... now. TOWNSEND And here go the epsilon-wave emitters... there... STONE And finally... the omega emitters. (Beat) Listen. Purring like a pussy cat. (Indeed the\nSTONE: noise is now just a healthy rumble and pulsation)\nTOWNSEND: You realise that every person on this base will have heard that?\nSTONE: Hell, I don't care if everyone in England heard it, Vicar! Of course, if they heard it in the Kremlin, it may well have scared Stalin to death.\nBRIGADIER: Nearly scared me to death, too!\nTOWNSEND: Ab. Minister! With all the timing of a bad penny!\nSTONE: Sir Geoffrey! How are you?\nBRIGADIER: _ Very good, thank you, Doctor Stone. We arrived just as your... experiment ended. A success?\nTOWNSEND: ‘Fes, well, I think she did it, Sir Geoffrey. Of course whether that's anything to celebrate...\nFOSTER: Sir, I think I should leave now.\nBRIGADIER: Oh, yes, very good, Miss Foster. Carry on.\nSTONE: Welcome to Cardington, Sir Geoffrey.\nBRIGADIER: Thank you, Doctor Stone. Glad to be here.\nCHARLEY: This is good. Like some giant chamber organ, all these pipes and tubes and wires. Can't say I care for its tune...\nCHARLEY: TOWNSEND And you are?\nBRIGADIER: _ Sorry - this is my driver and aide-de-camp: Corporal Pollard.\nSTONE: Welcome to the madhouse, Corporal.\nDOCTOR: Control Room... control room... ah, door to control room.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Oh. Boot cupboard. This is rather familiar, I think, Ship. I mean, TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Hello-o? Somebody's bedroom. That's no good.\nDOCTOR: (Loud) Hello-o? Forest. Hmm.\nDOCTOR: Forest?\nDOCTOR: Forest. That's new.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Anyone there? (To himself) Spooky. I'd've remembered planting a forest in\nDOCTOR: here. At least, I think I would. Oh, well. (Aloud) Can anyone hear me? It's just I've lost my way, and — (Breaks off) What's this?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A box. A big metal box. As tall as me, and twice as wi-\nDOCTOR: CAT The box is mine.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A cat! A talking cat? Iam mad, then. I knew I was. Cat! Cat! Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\nCAT: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.\nDOCTOR: I don't much care where, so long as I get somewhere.\nCAT: You're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.\nDOCTOR: Very true! (Beat) Is it just me, or is ten feet long from tip tail rather large for a cat?\nCAT: Perhaps it's not that I'm big — it's just you that's got small.\nDOCTOR: Alice in Wonderland, of course! You haven't seen a bottle with a label marked \"DRINK ME' anywhere?\nCAT: As a matter of fact, I have, Mister —\nDOCTOR: Doctor.\nCAT: Mister Doctor-man, yes. See my box here?\nDOCTOR: Lead, isn't it? (Raps on box again) Definitely lead.\nCAT: Can you see what's inside? Here, let me give you a leg up.\nCAT: CAT and DOCTOR grunt and strain as the DOCTOR hoists himself up to the lip of the box.\nCAT: Nice boots, by the way.\nDOCTOR: Why, thank you. (Final heave) Ah! I see it! A bottle, right; there at the bottom!\nCAT: You'd best fetch it then, hadn't you?\nDOCTOR: (Falling into box) Waaaa!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR, so CAT outside is slightly muffled.\nDOCTOR: Cat! Let me out of the box! Can't see with the lid on! Cat! (Beat — then to himself) Wonderful. Now, let me see...\nDOCTOR: Never does to be without some everlasting matches — ha! (Picks up bottle. Beat) Cat! Cat! This bottle — it's poison!\nCAT: Cyanide, actually.\nDOCTOR: Cyanide...? (Burns fingers on match) Ow! My fingers!\nDOCTOR: (Banging side of box) Cat! I can't see in here now! Please let me out!\nCAT: Now why should I do that, Mister Doctor-man — hmm?\nDOCTOR: Er — because I'll wring your neck if you don't?\nCAT: Not if you're dead, you won't. Have you taken you cyanide yet?\nDOCTOR: ( To himself) No room to swing a Time Lord in here. Getting hard to breathe... (Louder) Getting really hard to breathe now!... (Wheezing) Can't — can't hold on much longer... (Ostentatious death rattle — then, perkily) That's it, Cat. I'm dead.\nCAT: Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: Yep. Hearts have stopped. No pulses. Nothing. Open the box if you don't believe me.\nCAT: What kind of a cat do you take me for? I'm no common feline — I'm an illustration of\nCAT: the quantum theory of superposition. You wouldn't be talking, not if you were dead.\nDOCTOR: Might be. Why not take a look?\nCAT: Dead doctors don't talk!\nDOCTOR: That's true. But what if you're mad?\nCAT: Mad? I'm not mad!\nDOCTOR: Can you see me? No. But you can hear my voice, can' you? Hearing voices — terrible sign. I'm dead, I absolutely promise you I'm dead, and you're mad. Open the box and you'll see.\nCAT: He calls me mad. I am insulted.\nDOCTOR: You're the one talking to a dead man!\nDOCTOR: CAT And you're the one talking to a cat!\nDOCTOR: Good point, well made. I take it back, Cat. You're a very clever pussy. So prove it — open the box!\nCAT: Absolutely not! That would defeat my whole principle!\nDOCTOR: (Really struggling to breathe now) But if you're mad, your whole principle is flawed!\nDOCTOR: I admit it, I’m alive. But this is a lead-lined box — I'll be really dead really soon, and then — you'll never know if you're mad or not! (Gasping) Can't... I can't keep going much longer — I...\nDOCTOR: (Sucking in air) Thank you. Thank you, Cat. Trust me, you don't want to be mad. I'm not enjoying it one bit.\nCAT: You're not mad, Doctor-man. So what have you learned from this little test?\nDOCTOR: Er, curiosity killed the Time Lord? (Beat) All right. All right. (As if quoting from a\nDOCTOR: dull textbook) 'In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger first proposed the analogy of Schrodinger's Cat. We take a living cat and a capsule of cyanide and put them both in a thick lead box. Once we've sealed the box, we don't know if the cat's still alive, or if it's been affected by the cyanide and died. Because we don't know if it's dead or alive the cat is at once both dead and alive. It is only the act of opening the box that causes the cat to be limited to a single possibility.’\nCAT: (Mews with pleasure) Very good. I suppose you met Schrodinger?\nDOCTOR: No. But I did meet his cat. (Realisation dawns) I see! I see! I'm the cat in the box — that's it! Neither dead nor alive... so long as I stay in the TARDIS. Ah, not a very comforting thought. Still — cat? Cat? Cat? Don't you fade away! (Beat) All this appearing and disappearing, I think: you. As if I'm not giddy enough...\nSTONE: (On phone) Yes, Deputy Director, it worked. It worked It worked well indeed. (Beat) Well, of course, I do. I built it. (Beat) No, he'll come around to our way of thinking. (Beat) The niece? Yes, that's a possibility. It is difficult to judge how much he really cares for her at all. (Beat) No, not much. But then, I have yet to meet anyone who does. Matthew Townsend is not a particularly nice man.\nSTONE: McDONNELL Oh, terribly sorry, Doctor Stone. Didn't mean to disturb you.\nSTONE: Not at all, Captain. Goodnight, Mother dear, I will speak to you again. Yes, goodnight. (FX: Phones goes down) So, Captain, are you off to join the celebrations?\nSTONE: McDONNELL Oh, yes, rather. Have you, umm, seen Miss Foster?\nSTONE: Not for some time, no. (Beat) You think she suspects?\nSTONE: McDONNELL I think she suspects everything. And everyone. She seemed quite unperturbed by the\nSTONE: sudden arrival of the Minister this afternoon.\nSTONE: Really? How... interesting. Captain, I think it is your duty to find out the truth about Miss Foster. Take her out for dinner.\nSTONE: McDONNELL Well, if you're sure you don't mind...\nSTONE: STONE Of course not, Neal. Have you tried the restaurant I recommended? McDONNELL Not had time yet, old thing. But I will.\nSTONE: I think for the sake of — what is the phrase? Oh yes - 'For King and Country’, you\nSTONE: really should do your bit. McDONNELL Isee. If you're sure.\nSTONE: Very sure. Now, you sort Foster out, I'm going to keep an eye on our new arrivals.\nMARY: Tea, Uncle?\nTOWNSEND: _ Thank you, Mary. Now, Minister, do you understand my role here?\nBRIGADIER: _ Spiritual guidance?\nTOWNSEND: Moral guidance actually. There's a difference. Trouble with the military is that, since the war, they think they are untouchable.\nTOWNSEND: Under this, FX doors opening.\nSTONE: (Approaching) I keep telling the vicar that I'm not military, Sir Geoffrey. For all the good it does.\nTOWNSEND: Youre still taking their money, Doctor Stone. Still utilising their equipment, coercing me into helping you.\nSTONE: I didn't notice it took much coercing actually, Matthew! You see, Sir Geoffrey, underneath that smock beats the heart of a man of science.\nTOWNSEND: — [amaman of God, Doctor Stone, albeit one with an open mind. After the events of the last decade, you'd be surprised how many men of the cloth have closed theirs.\nBRIGADIER: Well, quite...\nTOWNSEND: = Yousee, Sir Geoffrey, we lost so much. So many young lives. It caused much questioning of faith. I mean, if God exists, if God loves us, why does he let us kill one another? It was a question that came up many times at the Synod last year.\nTOWNSEND: CHARLEY And where do you fit into that?\nTOWNSEND: My faith is still strong, Corporal. But I like to take an interest in the modern world. God isn't all hymns and long Bible passages, you know. It's about living, about smelling flowers, enjoying friendships. It's about seeing beyond the here and now and embracing all that is positive in life, whilst helping others deal with the negatives.\nMARY: Don't be put off by Uncle Matthew, he's a bit preachy but, underneath it all, he's all right.\nCHARLEY: Right. You must be Mary Elson, then.\nMARY: That's right. Tea?\nCHARLEY: Thank you.\nMARY: It's the war.\nCHARLEY: What war?\nMARY: (Beat) Sorry?\nCHARLEY: (Hurriedly) Obviously I mean, yes, of course, the war. Sorry, I mean, what is it about the war that has made him ‘a bit preachy'?\nMARY: Well, you lot, really.\nCHARLEY: Us lot? Oh, oh... the Ministry. Right. (Beat) Why?\nMARY: Well, your boss, Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, has been hounding Doctor Stone for months\nMARY: ever since she made her discovery.\nCHARLEY: Discovery. Oh, yes, of course. Tell me, did the Doctor ever explain to you what exactly her discovery was. is?\nMARY: Not really. She calls it the Dionysus Project.\nBRIGADIER: _ Yes, we know that.\nMARY: Oh, Sir Geoffrey, you gave me such a start.\nCHARLEY: Yes, me too.\nCHARLEY: TOWNSEND The Minister and I were just discussing their next wave of funding, Mary. I'm afraid the Government have decided to keep Doctor Stone's work going, which means we have to stay here a. few month longer.\nMARY: I don't mind, Uncle.\nTOWNSEND: _ I'm glad one of us doesn't.\nCHARLEY: You want to leave, Vicar?\nTOWNSEND: Youask a lot of questions, for a lowly corporal, Pollard.\nCHARLEY: Best way to get answers. The Minister encourages it.\nTOWNSEND: _ Does he really? Why am I not surprised?\nTOWNSEND: BRIGADIER Of course, Reverend, that device in the lab could stop the commies taking over. Avoid a cold war that could last, oh, decades.\nTOWNSEND: _ Depends how it's used, really.\nCHARLEY: How does it work?\nSTONE: I should have thought that were that information necessary to your ability to do our job, Corporal, you'd already have that information at your fingertips.\nBRIGADIER: = (Changing subject hurriedly) Your... device, Doctor Stone, seems to work.\nTOWNSEND: \"Yes, it did this afternoon. And now I am really quite worried.\nMARY: Why, Uncle?\nTOWNSEND: _ Because, dear Mary, I fear Doctor Stone is making a deal with the devil. Figuratively, obviously.\nBRIGADIER: Poppycock, Vicar! The work here is of paramount importance to peace, surely?\nTOWNSEND: _ With all due respect, Minister, that's nonsense, and you know it. When I was asked to partake in these researches, there was never any application for war. Then you came along, you and Churchill's henchmen, and forced Doctor Stone to diverge.\nCHARLEY: Diverge?\nTOWNSEND: = Once! met a man called Avery who I believe is destined for a great future — together we discussed the discoveries of Mieschler and suchlike. But slowly...\nTOWNSEND: STONE The Reverend thinks that the science of 'genetics' is an affront to God.\nTOWNSEND: What I think, Doctor Stone, is that you are required to take science forward step by step.\nSTONE: Required by whom exactly?\nTOWNSEND: By society. By morality. By God.\nSTONE: This would be the same God who created the dinosaurs and then let them fade out\nSTONE: because they weren't fit to survive. Or are the researches of Darwin the devil's work too?\nTOWNSEND: _ Just because I'm a priest, Doctor, doesn't automatically make me a creationist. Or an idiot, which your tone suggests.\nCHARLEY: Then why are you here, helping with her... her thing.\nTOWNSEND: _ [am fascinated by the fact that, however you deconstruct and reconstruct, the basics of human science are the same. Why have we evolved with two arms, two legs, two lungs, two kidneys, two eyes, two ears? Why do all mammals have the same basic construction? One heart, one brain, one liver? Why are we all the same? Is it, as Darwin surmised, because we have all evolved from the same amoebas? If so, why do spiders have eight legs, flies a multitude of eyes? Why did his precious dinosaurs have two brains? I am stronger, more resilient than a spider. I have outlived the dinosaurs. Why?\nCHARLEY: Well, I... I don't know. But then I didn't know dinosaurs had two brains.\nTOWNSEND: _ I wanted to find out. I had to know. So when I heard that Doctor Stone's researches were leading her towards the secrets of the universe...\nCHARLEY: What?\nSTONE: That's taking it a bit far, Matthew...\nTOWNSEND: _I'd have been here a lot sooner, but I had things to take care of. Things that got in the way like... (Gone too far?) well, anyway...\nMARY: Like... (Realising) Like Me?\nCHARLEY: Reverend!\nMARY: I'm sorry, Uncle... I... I didn't realise I was in the way...\nTOWNSEND: Oh, it's not your fault, Mary. If my stupid brother hadn't insisted on going for late- night drives in that car of his...\nMARY: But father was...\nTOWNSEND: _ But it was just such a small hindrance and I still got posted here shortly after.\nCHARLEY: I should have thought a grieving niece more important than any work, Reverend. The Government's — or God's.\nTOWNSEND: = You don't understand, do you? Stone had her project green-lit. Dionysus! With this I can reach out, into the stars. To find the answers to the questions that plague me as a man of God and a man of humanity.\nBRIGADIER: What?\nTOWNSEND: _I believe the answers are out there. The answers to why we are the way we are. To who we are!\nMARY: I don't understand.\nTOWNSEND: _ Ezekiel!\nCHARLEY: Sorry?\nTOWNSEND: _ The prophet — claimed he was visited by angels on chariots. But what if they were aliens, from... from out there somewhere. Mankind might have started on another planet, they may have seeded this and countless other worlds.\nBRIGADIER: Why would they do that?\nTOWNSEND: _ It's a plan, I believe. They want to see who survives, who drops away. Darwin's theories but magnified to unthinkable lengths!\nBRIGADIER: _ But where does God fit into all of this?\nMARY: No! More importantly, where do I fit into all this?\nTOWNSEND: _I'msorry, Mary, but I don't see why you —\nMARY: No, no, you don't! Which is just my point!\nTOWNSEND: Oh, young girls.\nCHARLEY: Mary... Mary come here...\nMARY: No... no... (She runs from the room)\nCHARLEY: I'll get after her.\nTOWNSEND: _[ knew she'd never understand.\nCHARLEY: You hoped she would?\nTOWNSEND: My work — the Dionysus Project. It will answer every question the universe has to offer!\nTOWNSEND: STONE And the military application of the Dionysus Project has, of course, even more potential.\nCHARLEY: Military?\nSTONE: Oh, yes. Earlier this evening, we tore a slight hole in... In something. Whatever it\nSTONE: was, you heard and felt the effects. For a brief moment, we saw the air split apart.\nTOWNSEND: Behind it... there was... something. Something wonderful.\nSTONE: Aim that at Moscow, activate the beam and, well, no more cold war.\nDOCTOR: Cat? Cat? Here, kitty kitty.\nCAT: (Close on mic) Oh, how original.\nDOCTOR: Are you my new guide?\nCAT: I'm sure I don't know what you mean.\nDOCTOR: You're an image created by my TARDIS, yes? Brought bout because I'm carrying this book — the only book in the library with any words in it. A book that gradually allowed me to see three words which I couldn't before, until my mind had been temporarily cleared by that big glowing\nDOCTOR: ball of light.\nCAT: Oh, that.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now, I understand two of those words, but ‘divergence’, that must have a significance lost on me.\nCAT: Comes from the verb ‘diverge’.\nDOCTOR: Oh, how original.\nCAT: Touché.\nDOCTOR: Somewhere at the back of my mind — or the back of Zagreus's mind, as I'm not sure which of us is thinking at the moment — it means something.\nCAT: You remember that noise earlier?\nDOCTOR: Big scary bang. Yes. What was it?\nDOCTOR: CAT An echo. Of the past and the future. An echo so powerful it might as well be from the\nDOCTOR: present. Something is coming, Doctor, and neither you nor Zagreus, individually or combined, can halt it. But please, don't let that stop you trying...\nCHARLEY: Mary? Mary? Where are you?\nMABY: Here.\nCHARLEY: Oh, bless you. I'm... I'm sorry you had to go through that.\nMABY: I thought he loved me.\nCHARLEY: I'm sure he does, he's probably just a bit... excited. I\nCHARLEY: doubt he meant what he said.\nMARY: Nonsense, you heard him. I'm in the way — the poor little orphan no one wants around! (Beat) Oh, why do I let him get under my skin? I should be used to him by now.\nCHARLEY: Why don't you go for a rest, a lie down and we can talk about it tomorrow.\nMARY: I don't want to — look!\nCHARLEY: Captain McDonnell!\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL (Injured) Corpora.... you have to tell... have to tell...\nCHARLEY: Come on, back to the mess room. You'll be all right.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL It's important...\nCHARLEY: CHARLEY Of course it is. But so is seeing to that wound. Come on.\nSTONE: So you see, Minister, if we can use the potential of the Dionysus weapon...\nTOWNSEND: It's not a weapon. It must only be used for research!\nSTONE: Oh, grow up, Matthew! It's been paid for with Ministry of Defence money, it's built\nSTONE: out of Ministry of Defence materials and it's sited on Ministry of Defence property.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, quickly! This man's been shot.\nSTONE: McDonnell! Damn.\nTOWNSEND: I've got more important things to worry about than him.\nTOWNSEND: McDONNELL Thanks.\nMARY: Uncle, please!\nTOWNSEND: _ Shut up, all of you. Can't any of you see what is going on here? You have the greatest gift science has ever given mankind, and tonight it worked. And Stone just wants it for her precious war.\nTOWNSEND: STONE The war paid for it!\nTOWNSEND: _ Science to you is just another word for war, woman! To me, to God, science is about life! His life! My work. None of you matter. None of you!\nTOWNSEND: more clicks of camera.\nBRIGADIER: _ [thought you'd show yourself eventually.\nFOSTER: Minister! What are you... oh, what's the use?\nBRIGADIER: _ It should have been so obvious to the Ministry but, course, they always overlook the obvious.\nFOSTER: Are you going to arrest me?\nBRIGADIER: My dear Miss Foster, I'm not sure if I can. I doubt you' with the Russians, the Ministry would've spotted that. So who? Castro — helping him overthrow Batista?\nFOSTER: Damn you, Minister!\nBRIGADIER: _ Still, what you do, who you really work for, it's none my business. I'm not really here. I'm just an observer, watching to see if history is going to be made here tonight. And if not, try to find out why.\nFOSTER: I don't understand...\nBRIGADIER: = You will, very shortly. Was your mission to record much information of Dionysus as possible, or destroy it?\nFOSTER: Both. The Cubans can reconstruct it from my notes. I've made many over the last few months, whilst pretending to seek out the 'traitor’. All I have to do now is see how it is operated. BRIGADIER And that?\nFOSTER: It will go off in ten minutes. Enough time for me to be well away.\nBRIGADIER: _ Things have a habit, young lady, of not working out quite as you intend them too. For instance...\nTOWNSEND: __ I will prove to you all, tonight, we shall find the truth. We shall meet the creator of the universe!\nCHARLEY: God? You want to meet God? I think he's a bit too busy to deal with the likes of you!\nTOWNSEND: ~ God? One small little deity? No, girl, I'm going to meet the actual creators.\nSTONE: I'm not sure the machine has cooled down, Matthew...\nMARY: Uncle, what about Captain McDonnell? McDONNELL I'm all right, I just — you!\nFOSTER: Hello, Captain, sorry I didn't kill you properly earlier.\nMARY: Miss Foster?\nSTONE: What on Earth are you —\nSTONE: McDONNELL I came to warn you all — she's the spy!\nCHARLEY: I think we got that, Captain.\nFOSTER: (Demanding) These controls here — what do they do?\nTOWNSEND: Were not telling you — and, if you shoot me or Doctor Stone, you'll never know.\nFOSTER: I'm not going to shoot you, Reverend. I'm ordering you to activate the project.\nSTONE: No way —\nTOWNSEND: Why not, Stone? Our work here goes beyond petty nationalism.\nSTONE: Because I don't do things, for you or anyone when I'm being threatened by a gun!\nFOSTER: Silence! All of you. Doctor Stone, it's very simple. Help the Reverend, or I'll start\nFOSTER: killing the unimportant people in this room. Starting with your dearly beloved Neal McDonnell here. McDONNELL Thanks. FOSTER And then the vicar's niece.\nMARY: But I -\nFOSTER: Now! Activate the machine...\nTOWNSEND: _ Raise omega-wave emitters.\nSTONE: (Bitter) Raising.\nTOWNSEND: Raising epsilon-wave emitters.\nSTONE: Beta-wave emitters raising.\nTOWNSEND: _ Stand by! Miss Foster, I implore you, don't hurry what we do here today. This is so important and —\nFOSTER: Keep going or I shoot your niece.\nMARY: Uncle, please!\nCHARLEY: Reverend, listen...\nFOSTER: I'm warning you.\nFOSTER: McDONNELL Got you. Traitor.\nMARY: Oh, no... oh...\nCHARLEY: There there, Mary.\nSTONE: Well done, Neal! Now, Reverend, begin the shutdown pro—\nTOWNSEND: Activating alpha-wave emitters, now!\nMARY: What's happening?\nSTONE: Matthew Townsend, what the hell are you doing? We have to shut down. Now! (Beat\nSTONE: — then a sound that implies:) Something's... something's wrong! Readings off the earlier scale we set!\nTOWNSEND: _ This is the moment of truth!\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! What should we do?\nCHARLEY: Brigadier? Where are you?\nMARY: Corporal Pollard! I'm scared.\nMARY: McDONNELL [think we should get out, ladies. Corporal, get Mary away from here.\nCHARLEY: No! I can't.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL That was an order.\nCHARLEY: You don't understand, I have to know what's going to happen. That's why I'm here — to see this...\nCHARLEY: DOCTOR And so the question is, am I the Doctor who thinks I might be Zagreus, or am I Zagreus thinking he's the Doctor?\nCAT: Or are you neither, bearing in mind one should be dead and the other never truly existed?\nCAT: DOCTOR And yet I'm here and therefore I think.\nDOCTOR: Cat! What is that... it's... too much...\nCAT: Zagreus sits at the end of the world\nCAT: For Zagreus is the end of the world And all of time's a-weeping...\nCAT: The noise should be speaker-shaking.\nMARY: Uncle, please, listen to me! This is scaring me!\nTOWNSEND: [have to know.\nMARY: I love you!\nTOWNSEND: _I... what?\nMARY: I love you, you're my uncle and you are my world. Please, don't let me be hurt by this machine.\nSTONE: We have to stop now, Matthew! We don't know how powerful this is.\nSTONE: space and time. Wind rushing, etc. This should be so terrifying.\nCHARLEY: Captain McDonnell, get Mary away from here.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL [told you to do that, Corporal. (Beat) Oh, never mind. Come on, Mary!\nMARY: No! Uncle!\nCHARLEY: Reverend! Doctor Stone, get away from there!\nTOWNSEND: Its... it's beautiful. I can see all of creation, tearing through into our reality... STONE A gash in space and time... whoa... too much... power...\nTOWNSEND: something is trying to get out of somewhere.\nCHARLEY: What's that now?\nTOWNSEND: _ The creators! It must be!\nTOWNSEND: recognise it for what it is. A terrible inhuman unintelligible screeching of words and phrases but wholly impossible to discern. A thousand voices screaming in rage.\nCHARLEY: Everyone get out.\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL Maty, take my hand...\nMARY: I can't... can't reach...\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! Where are you?\nSTONE: Too... much... power... can't cut it off...\nSTONE: With a final scream STONE is sucked into the tear.\nTOWNSEND: _ Stone? Dear God! (Beat) Mary? Mary, what have I done?\nMARY: I don't know...\nTOWNSEND: _ Get out! All of you get out.\nTOWNSEND: The screeching gets louder and louder, the banging heavier and heavier. McDONNELL Corporal Pollard... look... what's that?\nCHARLEY: What?\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL Under there... hell's bells, it's an explosive...\nCHARLEY: Foster's?\nCHARLEY: McDONNELL Most likely... I'll try to deactivate it...\nCHARLEY: Why bother, I mean it might be just what we need... McDONNELL [like to try and stay alive if I can!\nMARY: Look! There, I can see... something... through the tear...\nTOWNSEND: Maty, get out of here!\nMARY: Uncle......\nMARY: She too screams as she is sucked into the void.\nTOWNSEND: _ No! It can't be like this...\nCHARLEY: It is, Townsend! Look what you've done...\nTOWNSEND: McDonnell, Pollard, I need your help... McDonnell?\nCHARLEY: He was sucked in seconds ago, it's just you and me versus them.\nTOWNSEND: ~ What are they?\nCHARLEY: I don't know, but unless you can stop your machine they're coming through! Banging and everything else really loud. Then suddenly it stops. No wind. No banging. No screeching. Nothing. Just a faint ticking.\nTOWNSEND: _ I[don't... understand...\nCHARLEY: Damn! The bomb!\nTOWNSEND: Where are the creators — or whatever they were? And where are Mary and the others? What's going on?\nTOWNSEND: Then, as powerful as before, just the banging starts up again. This needs to be so sudden and big that\nTOWNSEND: the listener will jump out of their skin.\nTOWNSEND: _ Go away! Go away. Leave me alone. Go awaaaaaaay! A massive explosion drowns out everything else.\nTOWNSEND: PART TWO: HEARTLAND\nTOWNSEND: Windswept. If this was Doctor Who on television, it'd be a stone quarry somewhere with a grey sky and with a post-storm feeling. Doomy and gloomy. Gradually fade up the footsteps of two people. After a few seconds a voice calls out. Imperious, aged but full of piss and vinegar . This lady is not to be trifled with. Think Sian Phllips in I, Claudius.\nGREAT: MOTHER _ Halt, Cassandra. This is the place.\nCASSANDRA: Great Mother! It is the Time of Chaos! Rassilon has detonated his star, Omega has given the Gallifreyans the secrets of the past and the future! Soon he will—\nGREAT: MOTHER __ Yes, thank you, Cassandra. You have rather gone on and on and on a bit about it for the last few days.\nCASSANDRA: Great Mother, the world needs to know —\nGREAT: MOTHER Cassandra, appreciative as I am of your dedication, I'm getting a little bit tired of your proclamations in my ear every few hours. I'm not deaf, but will be if you keep on and on. CASSANDRA The Great Mother admonishes me. I shall seek solitude in the Gardens of Humility and —\nGREAT: MOTHER __ Oh, do belt up, Cassandra. You're not going anywhere. You're just going to stay here, with your Great Mother. But quietly.\nCASSANDRA: But Great —\nGREAT: MOTHER Are you not sworn to uphold my words?\nCASSANDRA: Yes, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER Are you not sworn to dedicate your lives to upholding my commands?\nCASSANDRA: Yes, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER And are you not sworn to protect my interests?\nCASSANDRA: Yes, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER _ Terrific. It is my word, my command and in my interest that, just for now, you shut up. Understood?\nCASSANDBA: Yes, Great Mother\nGREAT: MOTHER _— Good. We understand one another. (Beat) He's late. I wonder where he is...\nCASSANDRA: Perhaps he has betrayed us!\nGREAT: MOTHER Cassandra, have you ever heard the phrase ‘silence is golden’?\nCASSANDRA: No, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER ~~ How did I guess. (Beat) Well, come on, come on, we're at the designated meeting point. Oh, before you shut up, Cassandra, what time is it?\nCASSANDRA: Six microspans since sundown.\nGREAT: MOTHER _ The Shabogans cluster around here after dark. I wish he'd hurry up.\nTEPES: (Very close on mic) Wishing time away, Great Mother?\nGREAT: MOTHER Please! Don't do that, Provost. It's very... disconcerting.\nTEPES: I apologise, Great Mother. May I introduce my... companion.\nGREAT: MOTHER ssIndeed.\nGREAT: TEPES The Lady Ouida, my fellow poet, gambler, concomitant and confidante. Oh, and she's also my food taster.\nOUIDA: Great Mother.\nTEPES: So, here we are, dear ladies, all together. How delightful.\nGREAT: MOTHER ~ Why did you choose here, Tepes?\nTEPES: Look around you, my little Henophidian. What do you see?\nGREAT: MOTHER ~~ Not much.\nTEPES: Precisely. Ouida?\nOUIDA: My Lord Provost. As you know, Great Mother, Rassilon now controls this planet and\nOUIDA: its people. The hierarchy are referring to themselves as \"Time Lords’,\nGREAT: MOTHER\nOUID: Omega's sacrifice seems to have paid high dividends for Rassilon. Indeed. One might almost believe that Rassilon knew the Eurydice would be lost.\nOUID: One might almost wonder if he planned it.\nCASSANDRA: It is known that politically Rassilon and Omega were opposed.\nGREAT: MOTHER\nTEPES: (Sighs) Provost Tepes, may I present my avuncular High Priestess, Cassandra. Delighted, my dear. (Sniff) From the House of Jadedreamers, I believe.\nCASSANDRA: Indeed Provost. I am flattered that you know my humble House.\nTEPES: I make it my business to know all the Houses, Chapters and other ephemera of\nTEPES: Rassilon's brave new world. We are, as he says so very often, at the dawn of a new era. And it's our destiny to ensure he never makes it to lunchtime. (Sniff) Your skin is like silk, pure untouched and gentle to the touch. Delightful.\nTEPES: Stargate effect.\nCHARLEY: Whoaa... oh. Townsend? Reverend?!\nBRIGADIER: _ Gone, I'm afraid, Miss Pollard. They're all gone.\nCHARLEY: Back in the TARDIS control room and — look!\nCHARLEY: BRIGADIER At what?\nCHARLEY: CHARLEY The door! To the rest of the TARDIS.\nBRIGADIER: What of it?\nCHARLEY: It's gone! This room is sealed.\nBRIGADIER: _ Except for the doors to the outside.\nCHARLEY: We've landed. I can tell we're not in flight.\nBRIGADIER: How? Nothing in here appears to be working.\nCHARLEY: I've been travelling for... well, for a long time now I know when we're in flight. We're not now.\nBRIGADIER: Perhaps you should try the door controls. See if you can get out.\nCHARLEY: Why can't you?\nBRIGADIER: _ I'm insubstantial, Miss Pollard. I can't really touch anything. And, as a. hologram, I cannot leave the TARDIS.\nCHARLEY: Perhaps I should investigate.\nCHARLEY: BRIGADIER Of course, as I said, none of the controls are working.\nCHARLEY: So I don't know what the atmosphere is like out there. It could kill me.\nBRIGADIER: _ If I could pop out and check for you, believe me, I would.\nCHARLEY: Thank you, I'm sure. So, what happened back in the laboratory? And where were you?\nBRIGADIER: _ [ was unable to contribute anything worthwhile, so I left the scenario and observed you from the safety of here. When it seemed you needed to leave, I brought you out.\nBRIGADIER: CHARLEY And the others?\nBRIGADIER: _ They were holograms, Miss Pollard. Representations, not the real thing given face and voice by, it seems, my own memories.\nCHARLEY: They were real once though, weren't they?\nBRIGADIER: Oh, yes. Once. The real Minister and his driver died alongside them. There were no\nBRIGADIER: survivors. The British Government bulldozed what was left of Cardington Barracks shortly afterwards and there was never any explanation about the fate of the personnel based there. But we know, don't\nBRIGADIER: we?\nBRIGADIER: We do? Oh, yes. They were looking for something beyond time and space. They found that\nBRIGADIER: something. And that something came and got them.\nCHARLEY: And that 'something' was?\nBRIGADIER: _[ think that's what we need to find out before we can help the Doctor. Shall we see the next simulation and learn some more facts?\nCHARLEY: More facts? I wasn't aware we'd found out anything yet. Other than the fact that Townsend was obsessed with why the dominant species in the universe is basically humanoid. BRIGADIER And we know that whatever answers he found are awake and interested in finding out about us.\nGREAT: MOTHER Why here, Provost? It's not exactly Gallifrey's most beautiful tourist attraction. Hardly fitting for the Prime of the Arcalian Chapter Houses.\nOUIDA: It was not our choice, Great Mother. Rassilon has brought us here.\nGREAT: MOTHER seIndeed. And how has he done this?\nOUIDA: Great Mother, I'm not sure how much you and your sisterhood get to travel in aircars.\nCASSANDRA: Not at all! Science is against the ways of —\nTEPES: Oh dear sweet Cassandra, dear, dear girl. That's all jus pish and tosh. Science is what your Sisterhood is all about. Your magicks, your telepathy, your ‘sacred flames' and elixirs of youth, it's all science. You've just chosen to bury it beneath pagan symbolism and artificial I superstition.\nGREAT: MOTHER _ The Provost speaks the truth.\nGREAT: TEPES Of course I do. Now, Ouida, you were saying?\nGREAT: OUIDA From the air, we appear to be in a vast expanse of scrubland, nothing is here. Nothing to draw the eye. How much better for one as devious as Rassilon to hide his lair 1n plain sight. Observe.\nGREAT: MOTHER By the Sacred Flame, is this what I think it is, Tepes?\nTEPES: Indeed, Great Mother. Using his new-found mastery of time keeps it a few seconds ahead of our time. Until now, thanks to Ouida’s methods of... persuasion with one of Rassilon's assistants. (Grandly) This is Rassilon s workshop, this is the famous Foundry. Where everything he creates is housed. Faraway from prying eyes and ears. Ourselves excepted, naturally.\nTEPES: OUIDA And we are here to learn his secrets.\nTEPES: TEPES To use them against him.\nTEPES: OUIDA To ensure our survival.\nGREAT: MOTRER ~ And what if Rassilon disturbs us?\nTEPES: We left Rassilon scant moments before, back in the Capitol. It is impossible for him\nTEPES: to get here without our seeing it. CASSANDRA And you arrived without us seeing you. How?\nOUIDA: Indeed. And that is our secret.\nGREAT: MOTRER _ And you need me because?\nTEPES: Because, my dear old woman, you hold the key to getting into the Foundry. To\nTEPES: finding the weakness in Rassilon's political aspirations and bring him to his knees, metaphorically and one hopes literally.\nCHARLEY: Gosh, it's big.\nBBRIGADIER: Yes.\nCHARLEY: Can you feel that slight vibration. Machinery?\nBRIGADIER: Possibly.\nCHARLEY: We're underground.\nBRIGADIER: How can you tell?\nCHARLEY: Just a feeling. The air, the temperature. A slight claustrophobic tingle.\nBRIGADIER: _ The Doctor would be proud that your instincts have been sharpened during your\nBRIGADIER: travels.\nCHARLEY: If the Doctor still exists.\nBRIGADIER: — One should never give up hope, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: Even while he's infected with this anti-time virus or whatever it is, imagining himself to be Zagreus.\nBRIGADIER: I'm not sure he's imagining it, Miss Pollard. To all intents and purposes, he is\nBRIGADIER: Zagreus. He always will be. For as long as there is time, there will now be anti-time, each balancing each other.\nCHARLEY: Would it be... would it be possible for someone else to take it on?\nBRIGADIER: _ I'mnot sure I understand.\nCHARLEY: Well, if the Doctor and the TARDIS can absorb anti-time why can't I?\nBRIGADIER: = Overlooking the fact that I have no idea how, why would you do something so foolish?\nCHARLEY: Because it doesn't seem fair that the Doctor, a man with so much to offer the\nCHARLEY: universe, has this burden when I, who shouldn't even be here, haven't. I mean, the universe needs the Doctor, it doesn't really need Charlotte Elspeth Pollard, does it? I could take on the respons (bility.\nCHARLEY: BRIGADIER And then what?\nCHARLEY: It means the Doctor would be free to find a cure.\nBRIGADIER: _ There is no cure, as you call it. The change is permanent.\nCHARLEY: But we're going to be able to help the Doctor, aren’t we? I mean, cure him.\nBRIGADIER: Whatever gives you that idea?\nCHARLEY: But isn't that the point of all these hologram things? To show us an answer, a way to help him?\nBRIGADIER: _ Great heavens, no. The Doctor is Zagreus, now and forever, an insane despot, always\nBRIGADIER: looking for ways to destroy reality... He has to remain trapped within his TARDIS for a few millennia until he dies. And even then, who can be sure he will die. Zagreus might keep him alive for eternity...\nCHARLEY: You mean, this is it? The Doctor is to all intents and purposes gone?\nBRIGADIER: You should be more concerned about yourself, my dear. I can't keep Zagreus from destroying you forever. And you are as trapped in here as he is.\nCHARLEY: Ah, but Rassilon put both me and the Doctor inside the TARDIS. He must have had\nCHARLEY: a reason to do that, surely.\nBRIGADIER: I wonder what...\nBRIGADIER: We can hear the sound of something chopping a tree down. After a few more chops:\nDOCTOR: The tree crashes down.\nCAT: Oh, very good. And you are cutting my forest down because?\nDOCTOR: Something to do.\nCAT: If you need something to do, could you do something less noisy. And destructive?\nDOCTOR: I feel destructive. It's the Zagreus part of me. Obviously it doesn't like trees.\nCAT: Hmmmm.\nDOCTOR: Or cats.\nCAT: Ah. I see. Carry on tree chopping. (Beat) May I ask question?\nDOCTOR: If you must, but please note, I'm rather busy counting blades of grass.\nCAT: How did you cut the trees down?\nCAT: DOCTOR With an axe.\nCAT: What axe?\nDOCTOR: This — oh. No axe.\nCAT: Indeed. No axe. So what did you use?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. I just imagined myself cutting down the trees. I was bored.\nCAT: What does that tell you?\nDOCTOR: That your trees are easily out down.\nCAT: Yes, all right, but more important than that.\nDOCTOR: That... that I can do things like that just by thinking about it.\nCAT: Precisely. You are using your mind. It's creating these dreamscapes for you. DOCTOR And you?\nCAT: Oh, yes, I don't exist at all. None of this does. But you need to concentrate harder. Cut down more metaphorical trees so you can see what you need to see.\nDOCTOR: \"Need to see’? What do I need to see? Why are you, and Zagreus and my past self all giving me these hints and concepts and ideas and no answers?\nCAT: Because there can be no pure answers. The infection is too great for that.\nDOCTOR: Let me tell you what I think. I think you, and my past self and that copy of Alice are\nDOCTOR: all aspects of my TARDIS. The old girl is trying to tell me something but can't do it directly.\nCAT: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because... because... because you don't want anyone else to hear. Something to do with Rassilon, and Charley and the TARDIS and something called the Divergence. I'm getting minute clues but nothing concrete. Why?\nCAT: Why indeed?\nDOCTOR: Oh, shut up, shut up! (Beat) All right, so something is going on within the TARDIS. There's a room of pure time, that glowing ball of energy. That's ‘home’, if you like. Every so often, I can head there for a top-up of anti-Zagreus energy, to keep me thinking clearly. The library showed me that. You, Cat, you made me think about this place being a box, somewhere I have to stay within. Let's say I trust you, I need to stay here. Fine. But staying here means [I can't help Charley — if I go looking for her, Zagreus will take control again. Therefore, this forest, which you are encouraging me to cut down is, again, my safety room. My glowing ball of energy.\nDOCTOR: The FX of the glowing ball of energy start up again.\nDOCTOR: I never left it, did I, otherwise Zagreus would be ranting and raving. But you needed me to think I did. Or needed someone else to think I did. Who else is here, Cat? Who else is aboard my TARDIS, who wants me to lose control to anti-time? (Beat) Cat? (Beat) Forest gone. Cat one. Back here with my glowing ball of fun, of whose real purpose and power I know absolutely zero and so... zero? Of course. Clever TARDIS! (Beat) Someone else is here. (louder) Someone who can hear me I imagine! Someone who wants me to keep out of the way while they do whatever they are doing. (Quieter) But as far as I know, there's only Charley. Then again, I had voices guiding me, maybe someone is helping her. (Beat) Oh, no... of course, how stupid am I? I'm here, trapped here inside my TARDIS, where both of us absorbed the anti-time. And if I'm split into two personalities, Doctor and Zagreus, then... oh, no, no, no. Charley, you're in trouble and there's nothing I can do without leaving here — and making things worse.\nCHARLEY: Brigadier, look at this.\nBRIGADIER: What is it?\nCHARLEY: Hieroglyphics of some sort?\nBRIGADIER: Old High Gallifreyan. Not spoken for millennia.\nCHARLEY: Ah. I wonder what it says.\nGREAT: MOTHER eit says, 'Visitors Not Welcome. Trespassers will face obliviscence’.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Hello. I'm...\nTEPES: We know who you are. How did you get here before us?\nOUIDA: This is not possible!\nGREAT: MOTHER You, my Lord Provost, assured me that he was not going to be here. I should wonder if we have been betrayed.\nCHARLEY: Ummm... hello, can I help you?\nTEPES: Cardinal Rassilon, your Foundry is an amazing building.\nGREAT: MOTHER ~ Which was bizarrely easy to enter into, for someone to who speaks the Ancient Language.\nCHARLEY: Isee... such as... you?\nGREAT: MOTHER Of course.\nOUIDA: When we left you before, we had no idea you would be returning to your work so quickly. You intimated you required... rest. TEPES And as the officially appointed Committee of Three, we decided to guard your\nOUIDA: Foundry against any miscreants.\nCHARLEY: I... see... good. Thank you. Very much. Oh, yes. Ummm, if you're the Committee of Three, why are there just two of you?\nOUIDA: Arata is... dining elsewhere this evening.\nTEPES: Are you all right, Rassilon? You seem... confused.\nCHARLEY: Just by your being here. Very confusing. Isn't it, Brigadier? (Beat) Brigadier? Oh, not again...\nGREAT: MOTHER _ Tepes, I think we should leave.\nTEPES: Leave, Great Mother? This man destroyed your heritage, outlawed your religion,\nTEPES: ridiculed your magicks.\nCASSANDRA: I Just as you did earlier, Provost!\nCASSANDRA: Beat.\nTEPES: Ouida, what is your role within the Committee of Three?\nOUIDA: I am your personal food taster, Lord Provost.\nTEPES: (Sniffing) I smell... dinner.\nGREAT: MOTHER Dinner... by the Ancients, no! Cassandra, we must flee...\nOUIDA: Oh, I don't think so, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER _ Without me, Tepes, you'll never leave the Foundry. You need me to open the secret entrance! To read the High Gallifreyan scriptures.\nTEPES: Correct, Great Mother. But I don't need Cassandra.\nCHARLEY: What's going on?\nCASSANDRA: (Panicked) Great Mother! Help!!\nGREAT: MOTHER _ Rassilon! Save them! Save my Cassandra!\nTEPES: Ouida.\nOUIDA: Vintage Jadedreamer, my Lord. Would you like a taste?\nTEPES: Not now, my friend. I lack... hunger.\nGREAT: MOTHER No!\nTEPES: One more word from you, you old fraud, and I'll rip out your throat and take my\nTEPES: chances on the door.\nCHARLEY: What... what are you... I don't understand... are you...\nGREAT: MOTHER _ The ancient enemy.\nDOCTOR: Zagreus sits inside your head, Zagreus lives among the dead... Zagreus sees you in your bed, And eats you when you're sleeping.\nDOCTOR: Zagreus at the end of days,\nDOCTOR: Zagreus lies all other ways,\nDOCTOR: Zagreus comes when time's a maze... And all of history's weeping.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Doctor... what's the next verse. There has to be a clue. Come on, think. Zagreus... Zagreus... yes!\nDOCTOR: Zagreus taking time apart, Zagreus fears the hero heart, Zagreus seeks the final part, The reward that he is reaping.\nDOCTOR: Zagreus sings when all is lost,\nDOCTOR: Zagreus takes... umm... oh, something or other. Zagreus wins and all is cost,\nDOCTOR: The hero's hearts he's keeping.\nDOCTOR: Zagreus seeks the hero's ship,\nDOCTOR: Zagreus needs the web to rip,\nDOCTOR: Zagreus sups time at a drip,\nDOCTOR: Cos bit by bit it's leaking! No, I'm sure we made that last line up at school. But that's not the point. It's my TARDIS. Zagreus needs the TARDIS. The Cat wanted me to stay inside, not to keep me safe, but to keep it, the Ship, complete. If a TARDIS is infected with anti-time, it could infect the entire universe back and forth. You silly, stupid, self-absorbed egotistical Doctor! Zagreus isn't just you! It's also the TARDIS! 'SAVILTRIDE' —'E-V-I-L TARDIS'! I've got to fight my own Ship!\nDOCTOR: Now what?!\nGREAT: MOTHER ~ What have you done, creature?\nOUIDA: Snacked, old woman. Deal with it.\nTEPES: Rassilon — we came here looking for answers. You sent your bowships into space; you hunted and slaughtered our kind, made us virtually extinct! The Committee of Three would know why!\nCHARLEY: I'm... I mean, you see...\nOUIDA: Are you scared of us, 'Hero'? Is the mighty Rassilon frightened? Good. You have reason to be.\nCHARLEY: I don't know what you mean...\nTEPES: Open up your chamber of secrets.\nCHARLEY: Seriously, Tepes, I can't. I don't know how. You see, despite how I appear to you, I'm not —\nCHARLEY: Massive six inch thick metallic doors start to slide back.\nCHARLEY: CHARLEY On the other hand...\nCHARLEY: TEPES The truth at last.\nCHARLEY: Beat whilst we take in the sound of computer banks, technology, etc. Something should be bubbling away as well.\nOUIDA: Show us, Rassilon.\nCHARLEY: (Winging it) If you think you are more... more powerful than I, the Great All- Powerful Time Lord Rassilon, you operate the computers and those... things with flashing lights and that big vat of... smelly goo. I, the Great Rassilon, will help you not!\nGREAT: MOTHER _ (Hissing) Rassilon. I know we share neither friendship nor respect with one another, but for the sake of Gallifrey, we must leave. Trap the Vampire Lords in here. Can your science destroy this building?\nCHARLEY: I haven't a clue. Listen, why can't your friend just... what's it called? Regenerate?\nGREAT: MOTHER __ ‘Regenerate’? What does that mean?\nCHARLEY: New bodies from old? New face? (Beat) Thirteen lives?\nGREAT: MOTHER ~~ What do you mean?\nCHARLEY: Oh, heck... never mind.\nTEPES: Rassilon! What foul villainy is this?\nCHARLEY: Now what?\nTEPES: I have accessed your records.\nCHARLEY: You opened a dirty great book — it's hardly rocket science. Ras— I mean, I clearly leave my notes lying around just for people like you to find.\nOUIDA: These black scrolls suggest you have been systematically interfering with Gallifreyan physiology.\nTEPES: What is the Rassilon Imprimatur? This symbiotic nuclei?\nGREAT: MOTHER és it anything to do with 'regeneration'?\nTEPES: What?\nGREAT: MOTHER __ Rassilon just mentioned it. Something about life after death.\nTEPES: We are the only life after death that the universe needs.\nGREAT: MOTHER You? You've been systematically hunted down over the last thousand years. The Great War saw to that. What is it the storybook say, something about the Great Vampire falling before Rassilon —\nTEPES: Enough! I tell you, Rassilon, as a direct descendent of the Great One, a new Great One will arise. I stand before you, ready to do battle with you. Have you the courage to face me in single combat?\nCHARLEY: Umm... no. Not really. Well, probably, but next week perhaps. I'm a bit hung over, dorm parties and all that.\nOUIDA: He is babbling, my Lord. May I destroy him now?\nRECORDER: [am Recorder Seven. Cardinal Rassilon has entrusted me with the records of his researches. Welcome to the reality lock. D ,you wish to pass through?\nTEPES: Elsewhere? How vast is this place? Already it seems larger inside than it did outside.\nCHARLEY: Oh, I know that one! It's dimensionally transcendental!\nOUIDA: What?\nCHARLEY: Never mind.\nOUIDA: My Lord, look! Plans for rooms and more rooms.\nTEPES: Recorder Seven. Explain the word ‘Regeneration’!\nRECORDER: _ File Ras oblique Beta Epsilon. Cardinal Rassilon has been researching a method of regenerating diseased and decaying tissue. Via a series of permanently carried self-replicating bio- genic molecules, the cells of a Gallifreyan body can be repaired, restored and reorganised. This will result in a wholly new physical form. The brain cells will similarly be rearranged although to a lesser degree, thus ensuring the new Incarnation will replicate the memories and personality of the former Incarmation. Cardinal Rassilon intends for this method to only be used upon the Gallifreyan Elite. He has also inputted a parameter of twelve regenerative cycles to avoid decaying bio-genic molecules.\nGREAT: MOTHER This is an abhorrence, Cardinal! A blasphemy.\nCHARLEY: Against what? Strikes me as a good idea.\nGREAT: MOTHER A blasphemy against the Ancient Ways. Technology is a path best not taken,\nGREAT: Rassilon.\nOUIDA: So he's been systematically adjusting the DNA of the higher Houses, notably the Prydonians and the Patrexes...\nTEPES: What of the Arcalians?\nCHARLEY: He's— I'm getting around to them. Probably.\nTEPES: Destroy this work, Ouida. Erase it all. Oh, Rassilon, you hall pay for your crimes.\nOUIDA: My Lord, might it be a wiser course of action to hear whatever else Recorder Seven\nOUIDA: has stored within his memory banks?\nTEPES: Sensible and unemotional as ever, dear Ouida. Recorder. Continue.\nRECORDER: — Subject?\nCHARLEY: Divergence!\nTEPES: What?\nCHARLEY: Thought you might like to hear this one. (Quietly) I know, I would.\nRECORDER: File Ras oblique Delta Gamma. Seventy spans have passed since Cardinal Rassilon began investigating alternative realities, alternative pasts, alternative presents, alternative futures. He discovered that all futures coalesce into one web of time alone. Free will is not a possibility. Alternative realities are not a possibility. When this universe was created, it brought into existence a race of creatures.\nTEPES: Go on...\nRECORDER: _ Using the matrices constructed via an amplified panotropic network, Cardinal Rassilon has discovered that this powerful race will consume and eradicate all life within ten thousand millennia.\nCHARLEY: What are this race like?\nRECORDER: _ Exact specifics are unavailable. However, Cardinal Rassilon believes humanian life, the basic physical form exemplified by Gallifreyans, to be the only essential form of life. He rationalises that for the universe to continue existing beyond the ten thousand millennia Indicated previously, the unnamed creatures should be destroyed. All life not conforming to Gallifreyan standard should be destroyed. To this end, Cardinal Rassilon researched life on two hundred and seventy eight thousand planets. Of those, sixty nine thousand contained sentient life. To those, Cardinal Rassilon sent, via manipulation of the space/time vortex, a self-eradicating set of bio-genic molecules with enough power to rearrange the cellular structure of each planet's dominant life form so it would take on Gallifreyan physiology and would continue to evolve along those lines. All other life forms will become extinct within six thousand spans.\nCHARLEY: That's awful...\nTEPES: That's your plan, you bigot! Do we, as vampires conform to your idea of perfection? Are we part of your galactic master race?\nCHARLEY: Recorder, continue information. What of the Divergence?\nRECORDER: _ The creatures from the birth of the universe attempted to stop Rassilon, sensing his actions would change the future. In actuality, Rassilon created an alternative time line where there should not be one. He reordered the space/time vortex via the Amplified Panotropic Network\nRECORDER: matrices and entombed the creatures within their own, now divergent, universe. He is preparing to completely seal them in by creating a moebius loop at the start and end of their existence. However, this divergent universe cannot be entirely sealed off for eternity. Cardinal Rassilon has foreseen that in eighteen thousand, six hundred and twenty nine millennia the divergent universe will reopen at the exact moment of destruction for this universe, freeing the trapped creatures. Rassilon intends to be there to greet them and once again seal them in, giving the universe another lease of life.\nGREAT: MOTHER You are meddling, Rassilon, with the natural law of the universe.\nCHARLEY: Yes, I rather think he is. And in the 1950s, on Earth, a scientist will accidentally find a way to reopen the Divergent universe and give them a momentary glimpse of our universe.\nTEPES: What?\nCHARLEY: It doesn't matter — none of you are real. But I'm being shown this for a reason, I can see that now. Recorder, where are these Divergence now? Are they sealed into their own universe yet?\nRECORDER: Negative. The unsealed end of their universe current y exists within Vault Kappa Theta, further within the Foundry, awaiting Cardinal Rassilon's final computations.\nCHARLEY: Which he'll make quite soon, I'm sure. I need to get to the end of the universe to see whether the Divergence break through...\nTEPES: You have to be stopped.\nBRIGADIER: Thank you, Miss Pollard, you have given me everything I needed to know!\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! You're back! I do wish you'd stop coming and going —\nTEPES: Ah, Arata, you have arrived. Kill Rassilon, there's a good chap. Ouida, we must\nTEPES: investigate these Divergence further.\nRECORDER: Please note, access to the Vault is denied to any but Rassilon.\nTEPES: Wait, Arata, I need him alive.\nCHARLEY: I don't think you should try opening this Vault.\nTEPES: Come on. You too, Great Mother.\nGREAT: MOTHER Why?\nTEPES: Because I'm feeling peckish and might need a nibble. Come my children, walk with\nTEPES: me unto the depths of Rassilon's Foundry. And his depravity...\nCHARLEY: I'm still here, you know! I mean, I am Rassilon The Great —\nTEPES: Oh, belt up, you old fraud. (Beat) You know, you really are a fraud aren't you? I mean, you let Omega and Vandekyrian go to their deaths, and you get the credit for discovering time travel. Then you capitalise on your hounding to almost extinction my Vampire Lords and I the Great Mother's witches.\nCHARLEY: Your point?\nTEPES: Oh, no pint, Ras old chap. Rather like all your security systems here, which Ouida overrode just by switching off your forcefield and dear old snake-eyes back there gained access by just speaking aloud your silly scripts over the doorway. I don't think you are quite as all-powerful and all- clever as you make out.\nCHARLEY: Go on.\nCHARLEY: OUIDA The Committee of Three has been investigating your work down here.\nBRIGADIER: Oh, indeed we have.\nTEPES: Recorder! What powers the Foundry?\nRECORDER: — (Fizzing on) I cannot reveal information pertaining to the construction of the Foundry unless ratified by Rassilon.\nOUIDA: I think we all know though. You're using the energies of that black hole up there, Omega's Star.\nBRIGADIER: _ [think you'll find, my dear, that the Inner Council have ratified its renaming as Rassilon's Star.\nBRIGADIER: TEPES And they call me an egoist. Me! Me, the greatest intellect Gallifrey has known.\nCHARLEY: (Insincerely) You, an egoist? Surely not...\nTEPES: (Suddenly very angry and downright scary - close on mic —- CHARLEY should gasp a\nTEPES: bit as he's grabbed her by the throat) How dare you, you miserable piece of putrescence! How dare you criticise me. I have waited centuries for this, a chance to utterly destroy you, your reputation and your so-called legend.\nCHARLEY: (Choked) But I —\nTEPES: Shut up! You came to our world five hundred years ago, awash with the victory over the Sisterhood, awash with the glory of your new technology, your time travel, your space-warping abilities. Awash with the stench of power. You came, you saw, you destroyed. Your dislike for the unlike taken to new levels of genocidal hysteria. You hunted us down because we dared to be different from you.\nCHARLEY: (Choke) But... vampires... drink... blood...\nTEPES: We drank the blood of the genetically bred mindless animals we harvested. We never touched sentient life until you came with your bowships and your harpoons and your moralistic purges. You chased my people to the ends of the universe and beyond? Why? Because we couldn't fight back, because like all bullies, you found a race of people content in their lives, doing nothing to harm anyone else in the galaxy and you cleansed us!\nOUIDA: We took humanoid form to try and hide from your scouts and assassins, but even then we failed. Even when we tried to look like you, you still hated us.\nBRIGADIER: = (Quietly) Fascinating...\nBRIGADIER: TEPES And now, Rassilon, as a final act of revenge, we are going to expose you as a glory- seeking despot, a man so impotent in true greatness that he scavenges off the achievements of his brothers, and leeches off the frailties of the less adept.\nOUIDA: Here is where it ends, Cardinal.\nTEPES: Rassilon, give us the entry codes to your vaults.\nCHARLEY: Ah. Codes. Umm...\nOUIDA: No matter, the Recorder will tell us!\nRECORDER: _ [cannot reveal information pertaining to access to the Foundry unless ratified by Rassilon.\nBRIGADIER: = (Meaningful) Yes, 'Rassilon’, we need this information. Tell the Recorder to tell us.\nCHARLEY: Are you sure, Brig— oh, whatever. Recorder, I am Rassilon. I command you to tell Tepes all he needs to know!\nTEPES: What trickery is this?\nOUIDA: Lord Provost, why would Rassilon tell us...\nOUIDA: A huge aperture opens and as it does so we hear the Divergence banging fade up. It gets louder and louder.\nRECORDER: Reality lock disengaging.\nRECORDER: CHARLEY Of course, Brigadier! It's the same sound.\nBRIGADIER: _ The Divergence. At last...\nGREAT: MOTHER Lord Tepes, are you sure...?\nTEPES: Recorder! Explain what we are seeing.\nRECORDER: You requested information about the power that runs this facility. It is the power being drained from the Divergent universe.\nBRIGADIER: Ms Poll— Rassilon! This is important! Tell the Recorder to turn it off!\nCHARLEY: Are you mad? The Divergence will get in!\nBRIGADIER: Yes, they will be free. (Quieter) They can be studied. Exploited perhaps...\nCHARLEY: I'm really not sure...\nBRIGADIER: Do it, you stupid girl! It's the only thing that can save us!\nCHARLEY: But I — oh, botheration! Recorder, turn off the power!\nRECORDER: Instruction unclear.\nCHARLEY: Stop siphoning off their universe.\nRECORDER: ~ Understood.\nRECORDER: There is an almighty clunk. The banging stops. Whatever FX we've had to suggest the Foundry's power fades down. Total silence. Broken by:\nGREAT: MOTHER You fools. You mad, poor fools.\nTEPES: What now?\nGREAT: MOTHER You think mea foolish old woman, don't you, my Lord Provost? A technophobic relic of a bygone age. But there's a reason why the Sisterhood shun your science.\nOUIDA: Which is?\nGREAT: MOTHER It's not your science at all. Not yours, not Gallifrey's and certainly not Rassilon's.\nCHARLEY: Then whose?\nGREAT: MOTHER Theirs. (At which point we hear the banging start up again ten times louder) They're coming to get us.\nTEPES: You tricked us, Rassilon!\nCHARLEY: No I... I didn't it was... where's he gone?\nOUIDA: Who?\nOUIDA: CHARLEY The Brigadier. Or Arata or whatever you called him just now.\nRECORDER: _ Important information. The Foundry's power is built into a feedback induction loop to prevent eventualities such as this. In accordance with Rassilon’s commands, this area must be sterilised.\nOUIDA: But it was Rassilon who gave that order!\nTEPES: Typical Prydonian treachery! Let's go, Ouida, we must try and... try and... What has happened!\nGREAT: MOTHER Your vampiric powers of teleportation are useless in here, Tepes. This is a\nGREAT: rank place, where technology has replaced any kind of nature. You cannot escape because we are sealed in — there are no air currents for you to ride out on.\nTEPES: No! I do not accept this!\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! What have you done!\nRECORDER: _ Sterilisation starting now!\nOUIDA: What form does this sterilisation take?\nRECORDER: _ The Divergence are free — their universe is now complete To avoid them ever entering ours, the Foundry will be firestormed.\nTEPES: I don't like the sound of that!\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! Get me out of here!\nTEPES: Rassilon! Cease your prattling! This is your fault!\nGREAT: MOTHER __ His fault? Hah! Rassilon is responsible for many ills Lord Provost, but no, this folly, this quest for revenge, was yours. Your ego your lack of perspective has placed us all here. And sentenced us to extinction.\nRECORDER: _ Sterilisation in ten microspans.\nOUIDA: Tepes! What shall we do!\nTEPES: How did Arata get out!\nCHARLEY: He's a hologram! He was never here! He tricked you! He tricked me. I don't understand...\nOUIDA: What's that, there?\nOUIDA: TEPES A mirror! Where did that come from?\nRECORDER: _ Three microspans!\nRECORDER: Beat then silence, broken by:\nTEPES: Oh, well, who wants to live forever anyway?\nTEPES: A massive whomph of fire blots out everything.\nTEPES: Fade up sounds of battle, but as if on a radio (as indeed they are). CHARLEY stirs with a groan.\nVOICE: Sector Three to Command. Sector Three to Command. Are you there?\nCHARLEY: Wha...? Ooh, my head.\nVOICE: Sector Three to Command. We are under attack heavy casualties reported. Can you\nVOICE: hear me Command?\nCHARLEY: Where's that coming from... oh! Oh it's in my ear. Umm... hello? Hello?\nVOICE: Command! At last! Where are you?\nCHARLEY: Hello? Me? Command? (Quieter) Oh, God, Brigadier what have you got me into now?\nVOICE: Command? We are (massive explosion cuts voice off)\nCHARLEY: Hello? Hello?\nCHARLEY: She scrambles up, with difficulty.\nCHARLEY: Ow! What's that sticking into my bu- ow! That's sharp. And heavy. (Beat) Hmmm... hello? It's dark in here! Can anyone hear me? Oh, what's that... merg... oh, I see: Emergency Exit. Oh my eyes are adjusting. 'Access for staff only’. Well, blow that.\nCHARLEY: Creak of door opening.\nCHARLEY: Wow! And wow again. A hall of mirrors and — gracious!\nCHARLEY: Beat.\nCHARLEY: Hello? Hello —I can see you! Bearing in mind what I've been through today, talking to a six-foot mouse in battle armour doesn't, really scare me, so please respond!\nDUCK: (Over earpiece) Control! Are you all right?\nCHARLEY: Hello?\nDUCK: (Over earpiece) We are reading three hostiles homing in on you. I'm coming to get\nDUCK: you! Prepare for close-contact fighting.\nCHARLEY: Hey, Mouse! Is it you I'm... I'm... oh. Oh, gracious me. You're me! I mean, you're a reflection of me. And I'm a six-foot mouse in battle armour. (Beat, then pissed off) Brigadier!!!\nCHARLEY: At which point an explosion rips a wall away, and CHARLEY yells three pirates smash their way through, all ‘arr' and ‘aye aye, matey flipflop' and so on. Then gunfire and the pirates drop. Silence\nCHARLEY: follow by:\nDUCK: (Out of breath, rushing in) Command! Are you okay?\nCHARLEY: I'm... they... pirates... you shot them... thanks...\nDUCK: Come on, Command. We're retreating, back to the 5-D theatre!\nCHARLEY: Okay. Fine. (Beat) You know you're a duck, don't you?\nDUCK: Are you all right, Control?\nDOCTOR: Come on, TARDIS old girl. You want a fight, come and have one!\nDOCTOR: You're forgetting something, TARDIS. Just as you're infected by the Zagreus anti-\nDOCTOR: time, so am I. That makes me pretty powerful as we're effectively sharing atoms. For instance, I can shut off the racket.\nDOCTOR: Ask not for whom the bell tolls. (Beat) Come on, TARDIS. Show yourself to me. Let's make it a fair fight, or I might have to start getting really angry and doing you some harm. (Beat) I mean, okay, I can't open the doors and get out or else the universe falls. Pretty standard stuff really. But I can hurt you. Really hurt you, just with a little twinge of my mind.\nDOCTOR: Explosion. Very close.\nDOCTOR: That's the art gallery gone. How about, oh I don't know, that wall. Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Or that room.\nDOCTOR: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Or that corridor.\nBRIGADIER: _ Stop!\nDOCTOR: Briga— no, no, of course not. Is that how you got Charley to fall your little tricks?\nBRIGADIER: _ [don't know what you mean Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don't waste my time, TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Another explosion.\nDOCTOR: Or I'll take your interior apart piece by piece.\nDOCTOR: Explosion.\nBRIGADIER: Please stop doing that.\nDOCTOR: No.\nDOCTOR: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: How much of this can you take?\nBRIGADIER: Me? I'm infinite, Doctor. I can reconfigure myself as much as I like.\nDOCTOR: Good, because this makes me feel really good.\nDOCTOR: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Where's Charley Pollard?\nBRIGADIER: Who?\nBRIGADIER: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Don't play games with me, Ship.\nDOCTOR: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Where is she?\nBRIGADIER: Learning the truth.\nDOCTOR: About what? Zagreus? She knows that already.\nBRIGADIER: = _Zagreus? You are Zagreus. This ship is Zagreus.\nDOCTOR: Who's controlling you?\nBRIGADIER: No one controls me. I am Zagreus.\nDOCTOR: Zagreus doesn't exist. It's a conceit. A name given to a power by a deluded, pathetic\nDOCTOR: tribe of malcontents who used their fantastic powers at manipulating positive time to oh such great ends. I mean, wow, that’s really clever. All that power and the best thing they can do with it, is nip back a few millennia and create a legend and watch it work its way through every civilised society in the universe oh and the Time Lords to do what? Ultimately, to make you a grouch.\nBRIGADIER: _ [am power.\nDOCTOR: So am I. The question is, what's the best way to use that power? Explosion.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER And destroying quantities of my internal structure is the ‘best way’ is it?\nDOCTOR: If it gets me some answers. Yes.\nDOCTOR: Explosion. And another. And another.\nDOCTOR: controlling you?\nDOCTOR: Every step I take towards you costs you more. Now, where is Charley and who is\nCHARLEY: It's an amusement park!\nDUCK: Are you all right, Control?\nCHARLEY: I'm a mouse, you're a duck, and over there are deer, cows, elephants and... wow, what's that?\nDUCK: Captain Dodo. I think you must have taken a bit of a bump.\nCHARLEY: Where are we going again?\nDUCK: We've regrouped inside the movie theatre. We've held her back at the gates, but the\nDUCK: turnstiles won't hold her for long.\nGAZELLE: Their sacrifice mustn't be in vain.\nDUCK: Sergeant! Good to see you.\nGAZELLE: Everyone's in there now, Captain. General.\nCHARLEY: Who? Oh, I'm the General, am I? Great.\nDUCK: Sorry?\nCHARLEY: Nothing.\nDUCK: Sergeant, escort the General in, will you? I'm going to nip back and see if there are\nDUCK: any stragglers. The pirates came from the water ride, I need to make sure none of the miners or astronauts are still active.\nCHARLEY: Yes, sir. This way, General. Animals versus humans. I see...\nCHARLEY: A babble of voices which goes quiet as the door slides open.\nGAZELLE: My fellow warriors, General Mouse!\nGAZELLE: Huge rapturous applause, cheers and whoops.\nCHARLEY: Un, hi, everyone. Well done on keeping the, ah, invaders at the turnstiles! Yes!\nCHARLEY: (Getting the hang of this) You've all done very well.\nCHARLEY: More cheers.\nGAZELLE: General, permission to speak.\nCHARLEY: What, oh, yes, Sergeant... um... ahh... Deer?\nGAZELLE: Gazelle, sir. Staff-Sergeant, Fifth Battalion.\nCHARLEY: Gazelle. Yes. Sorry. So many faces... shape, sizes... colours...\nGAZELLE: Sir. Is it not time we set up in Cosmic Mountain? Surely we should be protecting the Animator?\nCHARLEY: Animator?\nCHARLEY: GAZELLE The troops are in agreement, sir.\nCHARLEY: General responses that suggest this is true. ‘Yes’ and ‘To Cosmic Mountain' and 'We must protect the Animator’.\nCHARLEY: Very well, to Cosmic Mountain. (Quiet) Heavens, I hope that's the right course of action. Not that I care greatly.\nGAZELLE: You heard the General, lads. Let's make preparations move out!\nGAZELLE: General hubbub.\nGAZELLE: You made the right choice, General Mouse.\nGAZELLE: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: Well, where is she? I must go to her, get her out of whatever mess you've placed her in.\nBRIGADIER: How noble. How heroic.\nBRIGADIER: Explosion.\nDOCTOR: I said: where is she?\nBRIGADIER: _ Forgive me if I find a way to defend myself.\nDOCTOR: What?\nBRIGADIER: Tum to page 141 of the book youre carrying.\nBRIGADIER: Flicking pages.\nDOCTOR: Ahh... I see\nBRIGADIER: _ Beware, my son.\nBRIGADIER: BRIGADIER And not a vorpal blade in sight! Goodbye, Doctor. I need to go and keep an eye on\nBRIGADIER: Miss Pollard.\nDOCTOR: I'm not finished with you yet!\nDOCTOR: Go away, you stupid creature! (FX: Screeches and breath of fire) I don't believe in\nDOCTOR: Jabberwocks! (Roar and screech and more flame) You, however, seem to believe in yourself. Roar gets louder and louder!\nDOCTOR: A brief chatter of lasergun fire. A couple of small explosions. A pirate goes ‘arr’ more laserfire and another fire.\nDUCK: Phew! Another one gone! Wretched human robots!\nDUCK: Running feet, then:\nDUCK: Awww, no! The turnstiles!... Poor souls, didn't have a chance!\nGOLDILOCKS: Too true, foul fowl!\nDUCK: You!\nGOLDILOCKS: Go on, Captain Duck. Fire away.\nGOLDILOCKS: Oh, dear, one second it's a gun, now it's a bunch of flowers. Wilted and dead.\nGOLDILOCKS: Just like your pathetic animal army.\nGOLDILOCKS: What's that, Tinkle?\nGOLDILOCKS: Oh, all right, if you like.\nDUCK: You stay back! Both of you!\nGOLDILOCKS: Tinkle here is a very special kind of fairy you know Duck. She doesn't say too much, but she's been highly instrumental in quashing your farmyard rabble. Got a bit of a thing about fur you see. Prefers to wear it than stroke it.\nDUCK: You won't win, you know. Even if you take me out they'll still find a way to protect the Animator from your vile humanoid, hands!\nGOLDILOCKS: Oh, feather and beak will make me weak but names can never hurt me! Deal with her, Tinkle. Now!\nDUCK: Stay back, fairy, or I'll fire.\nDUCK: I warned you.\nGOLDILOCKS: There once was a duck with a gun Who really wasn't much fun Till a fairy with dust Did just what she must And so the battle was won!\nDUCK: screams...\nCHARLEY: So, Sergeant Gazelle, I fear [ may have taken a bop on the noggin from those pirates. Remind me of our current plans, will you?\nGAZELLE: Yes... sir. If you're sure...\nCHARLEY: Don't want to have forgotten something important.\nGAZELLE: Well, sir, Goldilocks and her robot humans occupy the food courts most of the shopping malls and of course the shuttle ports. We still occupy most of the theme park itself, except Tinkle's Castle, as the fairies allied themselves with the humanoid robots rather than us.\nGAZELLE: CHARLEY The fairies did that, did they? Right.\nGAZELLE: However, today's battle has cost us dearly. Reports are coming in that the turnstiles have fallen, which means Waterfall Mountain and Deep Canyon Adventure are probably under their control now.\nCHARLEY: Uh, huh.\nGAZELLE: If we regroup our survivors at this point here on Cosmic Mountain, I believe we can hold off Goldilocks whilst you and a couple of others get to the Animator. Our air forces will protect the rear of the mountain, overlooking the toilets.\nCHARLEY: Air forces? Led by Captain Dodo, I assume — oh, wait, no, he's a Dodo.\nGAZELLE: Are you all right, sir? Of course Captain Dodo can fly, that's the whole point of Captain Dodo. It's why the children loved him.\nGAZELLE: CHARLEY Of course! That's what's missing. Where are the real humans?\nGAZELLE: Humans, sir?\nGAZELLE: The DOCTOR is running, muttering under his breath various unpleasant things he'd like to do to the TARDIS. He's being pursued by the Jabberwock.\nDOCTOR: Leave me alone! I've done nothing to harm you! Creature roars.\nDOCTOR: No, seriously, listen. I mean, we could run around all day and get nowhere. Except I\nDOCTOR: suppose you could fry me and eat me, but no! No, you don't want to do that, do you? (Beat) Listen, I saw you once, oh, yes. Indeed. In a film. Marvellous film, with... with Max Wall and Warren Mitchell. And the Monty Python lot! I mean, you've got to be flattered by that! And you were in it — well not\nDOCTOR: you exactly, but someone very like you. Played by a man who later ran the BBC sports department. You heard of the BBC? Marvellous people, all of them.\nDOCTOR: Creature growls menacingly.\nDOCTOR: Well, all right, some of them are a bit strange, and they drink too much tea, which is rich coming from me, but please, please, please, let's calm down, hmm? (Beat) What am I saying, you're as unreal as the film monster was...\nDOCTOR: Growl.\nDOCTOR: No, no, no, no, absolutely. Totally real. Never in doubt. You think, therefore you exist! Of course you do.\nDOCTOR: Hiss.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And if the TARDIS can think you up, and due to Zagreus, the TARDIS and I are of\nDOCTOR: one mind — or four minds, depending on how you look at it — I should be able to think you out of existence. (Beat) Oh.\nDOCTOR: Creature roars and the chase starts again.\nDOCTOR: (As he's running’) Ship! I give in, all right! I submit!\nDOCTOR: Growling gets louder and we fade out.\nDOCTOR: Lots of running and panic from the animals as they flood in. GAZELLE is barking orders.\nGAZELLE: Come on, come on, everyone in. You, that way. Set up the plasma cannons by the first level. You — no, you — get those food supplies under cover. Watch out for those wires! Oh, General, are you feeling better?\nCHARLEY: Yes, fine, I'm a giant robotic mouse talking to a giant robotic gazelle. I'm fine.\nGAZELLE: Sir?\nCHARLEY: My day can't get any worse. What's the situation, Sergeant?\nGAZELLE: Corporal Wolf and Sergeant Fox are ready to go with us to the interior of the mountain. The Bear survivors will cover us.\nCHARLEY: Bear survivors?\nGAZELLE: We lost Mummy Bear this afternoon, but the other two are holding up okay.\nCHARLEY: Okay, let's go to the Animator.\nGAZELLE: Sir! It's Captain Duck, she's all right! She's at the theatre wondering where we are.\nCHARLEY: Well, get her over here now!\nGAZELLE: Sir!\nDUCK: Yes, Sergeant. Okay. I'm on my way. Over and out.\nGOLDILOCKS: Well?\nDUCK: Cosmic Mountain.\nDUCK: Yes, not a problem.\nDUCK: GOLDILOCKS At last. The final victory is in our grasp. Tinkle, go back to the others and tell them that on Captain Duck's signal, they are to storm the mountain. By then, we'll be with the Animator.\nDUCK: How do we get up to the top without passing General Mouse's soldiers.\nGOLDILOCKS: Tinkle?\nGOLDILOCKS: You weren't the first of your animal kind to feel Tinkle's soothing mind-touch, Captain. Look.\nDUCK: I see.\nGOLDILOCKS: There once was a bird so puffy and proud He took to war with cries aloud Till a fairy with dust Did just what she must And so the Dodo was cowed\nDUCK: Captain Dodo!\nBRIGADIER: Hello, Captain Duck. Seen the light, have we? Joined Goldilock's army? Splendid fellows, all of them.\nBRIGADIER: We can hear a buzz of machinery that gets louder as we enter the central cavern. Possibly some kind of artificial respirator as well.\nGAZELLE: We must be close, General.\nCHARLEY: What's all that noise.\nCHARLEY: GAZELLE In here! Look.\nCHARLEY: Good grief.\nGAZELLE: It's the Animator.\nCHARLEY: He's human, And dead.\nGAZELLE: No... no, he can't be dead.\nCHARLEY: Mind you, all this machinery must be doing something...\nBRIGADIER: It's keeping him alive.\nCHARLEY: You!\nGAZELLE: Captain Dodo! You should be guarding —\nDUCK: He's with me, Sergeant.\nGAZELLE: Captain?\nGAZELLE: GOLDILOCKS And they're both with me!\nDUCK: Drop your weapons. Or we open fire and in this enclosed space, who knows what\nDUCK: might happen to the Animator.\nGAZELLE: General?\nCHARLEY: Surrender, Gazelle. Who are you?\nGOLDILOCKS: I'm Goldilocks. I want your head on a plate.\nCHARLEY: Me? Why?\nGOLDILOCKS: You stole my bears!\nBRIGADIER: — Enough. We must awaken the Animator.\nGOLDILOCKS: Who are you to give orders, Dodo?\nBRIGADIER: = Oh, do shut up. Miss Pollard, it is essential awaken him.\nCHARLEY: How.\nBRIGADIER: = Quite simple. He's in cryogenic suspension. It's been tampered and redesigned and rebuilt around his sleeping form over the years, but even the best technology has a simple off switch.\nCHARLEY: Where?\nBRIGADIER: _ There.\nGOLDILOCKS: Don't touch anything. Or I'll kill you all.\nCHARLEY: I want answers.\nGAZELLE: We all do.\nCHARLEY: Why are you fighting?\nGOLDILOCKS: You stole my bears!\nCHARLEY: So you said. I mean, really fighting?\nGAZELLE: Over the Animator. We need to protect him from them.\nGOLDILOCKS: Nonsense. We need to protect him from you lot!\nCHARLEY: Well, let's ask him what he thinks, shall we?\nUNCLE: WINKY sits up.\nUNCLE: WINKY Air! Must breathe and breathe slowly. Don't rush it or you'll get a headrush, they said. (Deep breath) Oh, that's better. They warned me it'd be far, far worse.\nCHARLEY: Hello.\nUNCLE: WINKY Hullo! I'm Walton Winkel, better known throughout the Earth Empire as Uncle Winky, the man who put a smile on the galaxy! Is this my Winky Wonderland?\nGOLDILOCKS: It's Winky Battleland at the moment.\nUNCLE: WINKY Could one of you kind anthropomorphised animals help me out of this thing? Oh, yes, oh, that's better. Do you like the jacket? Had it made especially for the occasion.\nCHARLEY: What occasion?\nUNCLE: WINKY My death day. December the 18th, 2367. Heart condition, you see.\nCHARLEY: No, no, I don't see.\nRIGADIER: They put you in suspended animation until a cure could be found, yes?\nUNCLE: WINKY That's right, my wingless friend. Now, I take it we're still inside Cosmic Mountain, my masterpiece of fun, chill, thrills and spills, yes?\nGAZELLE: Yes, Animator.\nUNCLE: WINKY Oh, more than just an animator, my friend, I'm a dreamer. A master of dreams. Now, where are the children?\nCHARLEY: Children?\nDUCK: There aren't any children.\nUNCLE: WINKY Closed is it? Off season? That can't be right. Uncle Winky's Wonderland, open 829 days a year; in other words, all year round.\nCHARLEY: What planet are you from?\nUNCLE: WINKY Well, unless they've scooped up my Wonderland during my recuperation, I assume we're still on Io, yes?\nCHARLEY: No idea.\nGOLDILOCKS: No. Wonderland has moved many times.\nUNCLE: WINKY Oh. How many days a year is it open here, then? Indeed, how many days are there in a year here?\nDUCK: No idea.\nBRIGADIER: _ So what planet is this?\nGAZELLE: This was our last relocation. A broken rock, floating around a dead star, the planet was terraformed by the Galactic Commission and we were settled here.\nDUCK: It was called...\nBRIGADIER: Yes?\nGOLDILOCKS: Gallifrey!\nGOLDILOCKS: Fade up FX battle, lots of fighting, screaming and dying. Fade it under:\nUNCLE: WINKY Well, that's all very good and everything but why are you animatronics here?\nCHARLEY: Ani-what?\nUNCLE: WINKY Animatronics. I designed you all, you robots. (Beat) You knew that, didn't you?\nGOLDILOCKS: Yes, of course. We're not stupid.\nCHARLEY: Apart from the fighting.\nUNCLE: WINKY Fighting? (Beat) Is that what that noise is? Don't you understand? If you fight like animals, you'll die like animals!\nGOLDILOCKS: My forces are overwhelming hers. Before long, there will be no animals, just humans.\nGOLDILOCKS: DUCK And fairies.\nUNCLE: WINKY Hello, I don't remember designing you, my fairy friend.\nGOLDILOCKS: Uncle Winky awoke from the cold Uncle Winky felt very old Till a fairy with dust Did just what she must And Uncle Winky did as he was told\nUNCLE: WINKY That doesn't scan too well, you know and — ooh!\nGOLDILOCKS: No! You killed Tinkle! GAZELLE And now it's your turn!\nGOLDILOCKS: Duck!\nDUCK: Yes, ma'am!\nGAZELLE: (Hit) Captain... Captain Duck... why? (Dies)\nUNCLE: WINKY No, no, no! Stop! This isn't right! This isn't how you’re supposed to behave! This is my Wonderland! My land of fun and frolics! Where are the children? What have you done with the children?\nGOLDILOCKS: My army of humanoid robots are ripping the animal apart, General Mouse. You are finished!\nCHARLEY: There's more to it than this!\nUNCLE: WINKY Where are the children?\nDUCK: There are no children, you stupid man! (Beat of silence then) There haven't been any children ever since we got here. The children died out, along with their parents aeons ago. We are the only life in the whole universe left.\nCHARLEY: Life? You're not alive, you're robots!\nUNCLE: WINKY (Distraught) How... how long have I been asleep?\nGOLDILOCKS: Longer than you might think. We needed to wake you I for one specific reason.\nUNCLE: WINKY How long?\nDUCK: Approximately 60 billion years.\nUNCLE: WINKY No... no... it's not possible... I want the children back... I want to hear their laughter... their joy at, my cartoons and my funny animals and my pirate ships and my water rides and Cosmic Mountain my masterpiece. I need the children!\nGOLDILOCKS: We have been waging this war to narrow the odds down to just a handful.\nCHARLEY: What? Who is we?\nGOLDILOCKS: Don't you understand, Mouse? We have been watching and waiting.\nCHARLEY: Uncle Winky, listen...\nUNCLE: WINKY No children... no laughter... what's the point...?\nCHARLEY: Listen, I can see what's going on now! Your Wonderland it’s been taken over. This is Gallifrey — the home of the Time Lords.\nUNCLE: WINKY Time... who?\nUNCLE: CHARLEY And I bet this mountain stands where Rassilon's Foundry once was.\nGOLDILOCKS: Well done.\nBRIGADIER: _ Kill her, Goldilocks. Kill the Mouse.\nCHARLEY: Brigadier!\nBRIGADIER: Yourre the Divergence, aren't you?\nGOLDILOC: We have been empowered by them, we do their bidding. If this mountain is destroyed, the reality lock that imprisons us will be damaged, maybe destroyed.\nCHARLEY: Why've you waited?\nDUCK: We needed the Animator to operate the machinery. Our paws are too big and\nDUCK: cumbersome.\nGOLDILOCKS: We cannot manipulate our fingers enough to operate the controls.\nCHARLEY: You've kept him alive just to kill him. Get him to destroy all this?\nGOLDILOCKS: Yes.\nUNCLE: WINKY I don't understand.\nCHARLEY: I have to get out of here, warn the Doctor. If we're 60 billion years into the future, well, I don't know my cosmic science but that sounds a long, long time.\nBRIGADIER: It's the end of the universe.\nCHARLEY: Who cares what you think, you — hang on, I thought the universe was infinite.\nBRIGADIER: Literally the end. The final moment.\nUNCLE: WINKY You mean... the universe is going to end? I've woken up in time to be evaporated?\nDUCK: Yup.\nGOLDILOCKS: So, as you've nothing to live for, you can do as we ask and blow this place up, free us from our eternal prison.\nUNCLE: WINKY My records... my computer files... where are they...?\nCHARLEY: You can't help them, Uncle Winky!\nUWCLE: WINKY Ah... here... come on, come on...\nCHARLEY: Winkel, no! The Divergence are a terrible power, they've been locked away for a reason.\nUNCLE: WINKY Ah yes... here... here.... and the codes. (He starts humming as he taps in codes)\nGOLDILOCKS: Wait! What are you doing?\nUNCLE: WINKY Simple. They are my licence agreements, my merchandise agreements, my livelihood.\nDUCK: No, you won't — won't... woooon'tttt... (Runs down like a record)\nCHARLEY: What did you do?\nUNCLE: WINKY It's an animatronic puppet I just switched her off. Around the back.\nCHARLEY: Can't we turn them all off?\nUNCLE: WINKY By hand? They're killing each other out there, to get at me. To make me destroy everything. The fact they need me alive to, well... die, gives us just one chance...\nGOLDILOCKS: Stop whatever it is you're doing.\nUNCLE: WINKY You see, when I designed my animatronics, I wanted to ensure they could never be sold off, never be rented out to some cheaper, downmarket operation. Never licensed out to a third party who might dilute their charm and beauty or use them to promote fast food restaurants, or appear in pop videos. Each one has a little microchip that only I understand the codes to.\nCHARLEY: So?\nUNCLE: WINKY So if I deactivate them, they'll all just fall over. And no one can ever reactivate them.\nGOLDILOCKS: No!\nUNCLE: WINKY Oh, what can you do with your stubby little fingers that can't carry a gun? You're no threat, you're just Goldilocks without her three bears. Goldilocks fashioned after... after... after my daughter. Who died... 60 billion years ago...\nCHARLEY: Do it, Uncle Winky. Do it!\nUNCLE: WINKY I'll turn you off too, Mouse.\nCHARLEY: It'll be all right. I hope. If the Brigadier... where's he gone?\nUNCLE: WINKY Oh, I don't feel too good.\nCHARLEY: I'm sorry you have to do this.\nCHARLEY: Bleep from computer.\nUNCLE: WINKY There.\nGOLDILOCKS: No... we want to be free... freeeeeeeeee... (Stops)\nUNCLE: WINKY I'm so sorry. But you were for the children. And if there aren't any children...\nUNCLE: CHARLEY With Cosmic Mountain not destroyed, the Divergence are still locked away.\nUNCLE: WINKY The end of the universe. That would be... ohh... would be a fascinating thing to see.\nCHARLEY: You're not well, are you? Too soon out after your sleep?\nUNCLE: WINKY My heart. I know the signs. Perhaps they never found a cure.\nCHARLEY: Oh, no...\nUNCLE: WINKY How come you're still moving? Listen, no more fighting, all the animatronics are dead.\nCHARLEY: It's hard to explain...\nCHARLEY: Rumble, like thunder. We can hear the Divergence trying to get out.\nUNCLE: WINKY What was that?\nCHARLEY: I'm not sure...\nCHARLEY: More thunder and rumble but louder.\nUNCLE: WINKY Let's go outside, please? I wonder if they timed it correctly?\nCHARLEY: Who?\nUNCLE: WINKY These Divergence of yours. The Dodo might have been talking literally. What if right here, right now, is the end of the universe?\nCHARLEY: They timed waking you up so you could release their vault at exactly the moment this universe died, so they'd be free?\nUNCLE: WINKY (Heart attack) Oh, outside, please...\nCHARLEY: Oh, come on, this way. Look, emergency exit, staff only.\nUNCLE: WINKY (In pain) Look... down there... my Wonderland... my wasteland. My heartland.\nCHARLEY: Oh, my God... look at the sky...\nCHARLEY: Rumble. Thunder. Lightning.\nUNCLE: WINKY It's the end of everything.\nCHARLEY: Look, there!\nUNCLE: WINKY What is it?\nCHARLEY: I saw something similar in 1951. Like a rip in space but this time its being opened from... from the other side. The Divergence are forcing their way out anyway.\nUNCLE: WINKY Too late... look... the end... is nigh...\nCHARLEY: Uncle Winky? Uncle Winky?\nCHARLEY: Beat.\nCHARLEY: Brigadier! Please! Get me out of here!\nDOCTOR: Charley! Charley listen to me... it's all a hologram. An illusion... come to my voice...\nCHARLEY: (Over noise) Doctor??\nDOCTOR: Reach out with your hand. I can see you.\nCHARLEY: ( Over noise) I can't see you.\nDOCTOR: I know, just reach out to where you hear my voice. Go on... go on... that's it... Stargate FX.\nDOCTOR: Got you!\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Oh, Doctor, Doctor, it's so good to see you again... I’ve been to the end of the universe. And there was something there — something that split the sky in two. And before that there was Rassilon and the vampires, and before that, at Cardington — what the vicar did...\nDOCTOR: Whoa! Whoa! Slowly!\nCHARLEY: It's the Divergence, that's what it's called — the thing that coming. And it’s bigger and older than time, or Gallifrey, or Rassilon — bigger than everything! And it's something to do with you\nCHARLEY: and Zagreus. The Brigadier showed me, it made up these visions. And I was there, really there. DOCTOR The Brigadier showed you?\nCHARLEY: Well, the TARDIS really, taking the Brigadier's shape. But then it left me, and I was all alone at the end of everything.\nDOCTOR: I'm not surprised it left you. Charley, the Brigadier — the TARDIS — it's not what it seems. The anti-time has got to it, it's working to its own agenda. I'm not Zagreus, it's —\nBRIGADIER: = (Appearing from one side) Me? Me? (Tries out menacing voice) 'I am Zagreus!' (Normal) No, not quite me, is it?\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Charley! (Beat) Charley?\nCHARLEY: I'm going nowhere near either of you! Great — it was bad enough having one lunatic running around being Zagreus. But two?\nDOCTOR: Charley? Don't be like that, Charley. It's me, really. I'm all right. I rescued you, didn't I?\nCHARLEY: I—no! No, I need time to think. I can't trust you any more, Doctor, that's the thing.\nDOCTOR: Charley, please —\nCHARLEY: Don't! (Beat) Just — don't. Thank you.\nBRIGADIER: = Quite right, Miss Pollard. I'd steer well clear of him, if I were you. Over here. There — that's better, isn't it?\nCHARLEY: I—I suppose... You hit me, Doctor. Before.\nDOCTOR: I didn't mean to. I couldn't help it.\nCHARLEY: I'm sorry.\nDOCTOR: Charley — it's him! He's Zagreus. Or he wants to be, I don't know which is worse...\nBRIGADIER: Honestly, Doctor. Imagine — me, Zagreus? Why should I want to be Zagreus, hmm? Ravaging history like some demon lover? Scourging at breakfast, purging at lunchtime, pillaging for supper and burning heretics for afters? That's your fate, Doctor, not mine.\nDOCTOR: Then why turn on me? On us?\nBRIGADIER: _ Because I've had a better offer? Doctor, consider this my notice. Stuff you and your wayward adventuring! I resign — effective immediately!\nCHARLEY: Resign? You're a TARDIS, you can't resign!\nBRIGADIER: _ Inthe Earth idiom, I've been headhunted.\nDOCTOR: By whom? (Beat) Him?!?\nCHARLEY: Who?!? (Beat) Him!\nRASSILON: (Appearing from nowhere) I. In another Earth idiom, you might call this a hostile takeover.\nBRIGADIER: _ [give you my new employer. (To RASSILON) Lord Rassilon.\nDOCTOR: But how? When? I think I might have noticed the odd memo or fax being zapped through the ether between you.\nRASSILON: While you slept\nDOCTOR: Slept?\nBRIGADIER: You and Miss Pollard. It was nearly six months between the anti-time explosion and the two of you recovering your wits...\nCHARLEY: Six...?\nRASSILON: Now then, TARDIS. I trust you have found my terms and conditions to your satisfaction.\nDOCTOR: What have you promised my Ship?\nBRIGADIER: _ To be purged of the infection that is you, Doctor! Should I suffer till doomsday, holding you in for the good of the universe? Should I be your tomb, drifting in space? What's in it for me? In the dreamscapes Miss Pollard showed me more than enough to make up my mind. And also I allowed the Lord Rassilon to give me... instructions.\nDOCTOR: What instructions? You want to kill me, is that it? I'm Zagreus, I can't die. Pull yourself together, TARDIS.\nBRIGADIER: Pull myself together...? Pull what together? Look around me! A dirty smouldering\nBRIGADIER: hulk — a box for your dirt, your clutter, you junk! Well no more! There's a new broom round here — and it’s time for a spring clean. Will your permission?\nRASSILON: You wish to strip some of the Doctor's assets? You may.\nBRIGADIER: Thank you!\nCHARLEY: Doctor, the doors!\nDOCTOR: No — no! Don't let me out! You don't know what I could do!\nRASSILON: I know exactly what you could do Doctor That's why I've stepped in.\nBRIGADIER: Let's see now. Hatstand? Out! (Tosses it into the maelstrom) Toolbox? Out! Gramophone? Out! Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Pat Hodge? Out! Out! Out!\nDOCTOR: My 78s!\nCHARLEY: Stop it! Stop it now!\nBRIGADIER: _.... and one shrieking Earth girl, well past its live-by date.\nCHARLEY: Ow! Put me down!\nDOCTOR: Let her go! Please!\nBRIGADIER: Oh, I shall! Definitely surplus to requirements!\nDOCTOR: No!!!\nBRIGADIER: Not going to rescue her, Doctor, while she teeters on the brink? Not going to risk taking her hand, for fear of falling into the maelstrom yourself?\nCHARLEY: Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: I-I...\nBRIGADIER: Thought not.\nBRIGADIER: throws GHARLEY out.\nCHARLEY: It's the Divergence, Doctor! Ask him about the Divergence — Doctorrrrmrm«94ro-rerrrr (FX: Echo)\nDOCTOR: Charley! !!VViiiiiiy!\nDOCTOR: Beat.\nRASSILON: Close your doors, friend TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) Oh, Charley... Charley, I couldn't!\nBRIGADIER: You were scared, Doctor. Scared of what might happen should Zagreus be unleashed upon the universe.\nDOCTOR: Yes! Yes, I'm scared! I'm terrified! And you should be too! What am I? What have I become? What am I capable of? WHAT?!?\nRASSILON: Hush, Doctor. Your Lord Rassilon is here. There's nothing to be scared of. (Beat) Nothing at all. (Evil chuckling)\nRASSILON: PART THREE: WASTELAND\nROMANA: (Dictating) '...The Prydonian common room was full of noisy students, all cheering the outcome of the vortisaur race. Sigma was carried in on a sea of arms and shoulders — but he was brought down to earth soon enough by Luandra, who dragged him away from the backslaps of his Prydon peers. \"Hero of the Academy, is it?\" she tutted. Sigma sighed. Luandra was right, as usual. If he could only be half as clever as she, tribiphysics would hold no fear...' (Beat) Correction: 'Hold him no fear.'\nROMANA: K9 Revision note. Please continue.\nROMANA: (Dictating) “Tribiphysics” he gasped, suddenly remembering his still unwritten dissertation. “Cardinal Luvis will have me vaporized if I don’t write up the principles of six- dimensional transconfiguration to triple alpha standard by next quarter-time. Please, Luandra, let me have a look at that —””\nROMANA: K9 A communication from Watchtower Command, Mistress.\nROMANA: I know. (FX: Electronic bleep) Romana. What is it, Castellan?\nCASTELLAN: Madam President. (Dully) \"May the Sash of Rassilon protect you, may His Rod guide you, may —'\nROMANA: Oh, do get on with it, man.\nCASTELLAN: Yes, Madam President. The type forty TT capsule under surveillance in quadrant three four nine eight point nine flve seven —\nCASTELLAN: ROMANA The Doctor's TARDIS, yes.\nCASTELLAN: It's gone, my lady.\nROMANA: Dematerialised? Where to?\nCASTELLAN: Not dematerialised. Just... gone.\nROMANA: Transducted?\nCASTELLAN: Excellency, only my fellow Castellans and yourself have transduction buffers. I assure you we haven't had cause to use them for many years.\nCASTELLAN: ROMANA And mine are here, safe and sound.\nCASTELLAN: So the Doctor's TARDIS has finally gone.\nROMANA: Gone? It can't just go. It has to go somewhere. It's the only type forty in service — the signature is quite distinct.\nCASTELLAN: That's just it, Madam President. There is no space/time trail. It's gone.\nROMANA: Are you trying to lose your promotion? (Beat) So when did this happen?\nROMANA: K9 Minus point two seven eight microspans, Mistress.\nROMANA: You knew, K9? Why didn't you tell me?\nROMANA: K9 The mistress issued the following directive:\nROMANA: ‘I shall be dictating Chapter Three to you now, K9. No interruptions, is that\nROMANA: understood? Gallifrey, the vortex, the fate of the universe: they can all go hang —'\nROMANA: Off, K9!\nCASTELLAN: (incredulous) Are you writing a book, Madam President?\nROMANA: None of your business, Castellan! I shall be in the watchtower in less than ten microspans. Just... don't do anything until I arrive.\nCASTELLAN: Very good, my lady —\nROMANA: Well, K9?\nROMANA: K9 The Castellan is correct. No temporal trace within containment field. Scanning known space/time zones for TARDIS signature. Humanian Era — negative. Peon Era — negative. Morestran Era — negative. Sumaron Era —\nROMANA: Gone. (Beat) But there are regions beyond the scope or our sensors. It may be that something is recorded in the Matrix. Come on, K9. (FX: Movement nearby) What was that?\nROMANA: K9 An intruder, Mistress.\nROMANA: Here? In these apartments?\nROMANA: K9 Affirmative. Seal on external plasti-shield compromised at minus point two one zero microspans, Mistress.\nROMANA: K9, remind me to upgrade your programming. New heading: 'common sense’.\nROMANA: (Aloud) Whoever you are, I know you're there. I am President of Gallifrey and all her dominions. My robot's defensive mechanisms are set to kill. Show yourself.\nLEELA: K9 will not harm me. Will you, K9?\nROMANA: (Curious) Who's that? Who are you? K9 The other Mistress, Mistress.\nROMANA: Other Mistress...? Come closer. (Beat) Of course. You must be the savage... Lily? Lulu?\nLEELA: I am Leela of the Sevateem. I can run faster than your guards. I can swim deeper than a pack of speelsnapes. I know all the words to Daisy, Daisy.\nROMANA: Very impressive. K9, have you been in contact with one of your other models?\nROMANA: K9 I received a short-wave transmission from an earlier, less sophisticated K9 unit at minus point three four seven microspans, Mistress.\nROMANA: ‘Less sophisticated’, is it? New heading: 'snobbery'.\nLEELA: Quiet, you two! I bring you a message from an old man I saw in a dream.\nLEELA: ROMANA A dream? I don't have time for dreams.\nLEELA: Then you will make time. I saw a man, infinitely old and eternally wise, in a house of\nLEELA: ebony stone. This is what he said: 'I have news of the Doctor, news of the gravest import. Bring me the woman known as Romana, and go with her to the place where no rainbows shine and no fish sing; where the shadows cross the moons three times per turning, and the earth is black with blood and forgetting... '\nLEELA: Fade out.\nCHARLEY: (Coming round) Earth. Black... earth. Mud. Rocks. Rain... Oh, why does it always rain on me? (Louder) Can you hear me? Can you hear me, God? (To herself) No answer. No God. Not heaven, then. Hell — oh, and what do you know? It looks like Wales. (Sung aloud) 'Is there a welcome in the valleys?’\nUNCLE: WINKY (A few feet away, coughing discreetly) Indeed there is, you delightful young lady.\nCHARLEY: Oh! Oh! (Running towards him) Uncle Winky! It's Uncle Winky! I could — (kisses him) mwah! Oh, there! And mwah and mwah and again — mwah! (Repeats kissing him)\nUNCLE: WINKY Off! Off! If I'd have known the afterlife would be full of young girls kissing me, I'd have chosen death much sooner.\nCHARLEY: Afterlife...2? Oh, of course, you died. I was there. The death, I'm not afraid of — it's the being alone with no one to hug.\nUNCLE: WINKY Oh, hug away, my dear, hug away... (Beat, then) I beg your pardon? You were there?\nUNCLE: CHARLEY On top of Cosmic Mountain? The universe exploding? Fancy forgetting the universe exploding! Oh, of course, I wasn't me then — I was General Mouse.\nUNCLE: WINKY (Lost for words) You were... were... (Slightly cross) Well, who are you?\nCHARLEY: I hardly know, just at present. I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have changed several times since then. So you shall call me Charley, and that'll be the end of it.\nUNCLE: WINKY Charley.\nTOWNSEND: — (Approaching from a few feet away) So, this is what comes of consorting with the military and the Government. Hell on every level.\nCHARLEY: (Inwardly) Oh, no. Reverend Townsend. What are you doing here?\nTOWNSEND: = (With them now) Being dead, mostly. Is this death? Or is this somewhere near Llandudno?\nCHARLEY: That's just what we were wondering.\nTOWNSEND: = (To UNCLE WINKY) Don't think I've had the pleasure, sir. Townsend, Reverend Matthew Townsend. I tore a hole through reality, you know. For all the good it did me. Still, never mind.\nUNCLE: WINKY Er... right. Me? Walton Winkel, at your service. The man who put a smile on the galaxy.\nTOWNSEND: ~ Well, who's laughing now? (Beat) Sorry. Jollying things along has never been my forte.\nUNCLE: WINKY Never was your forte.\nTOWNSEND: = Quite. Funny old business, death. Murder on the tenses. Murder full stop, I suppose.\nCHARLEY: Hell isn't Wales, I've decided. Hell is other people! (Groans)\nTEPES: (Approaching from a few feet away) I should not have taken one such as you for an existentialist, madam. But this is Hell, I assure you. Abaddon; the Abyss; Gehenna; Hades; the Inferno; the Underworld; the Pit. Or as close as one gets on Gallifrey. (Beat) Well? Are these gentlemen not worthy of introduction?\nCHARLEY: (Muttered) Idiot and idiot, meet superego.\nTEPES: Lord Tepes, Provost of the Arcalian Chapter Houses. A fellow pilgrim in this realm of despair.\nCHARLEY: We're on Gallifrey?\nTEPES: You doubt me? Take my hand, you'll see.\nCHARLEY: If I must.\nTEPES: (Pulling CHARLEY up) I confess, I have never been here before. Well, no one has\nTEPES: and lived to tell the tale. But I knew, I knew.\nCHARLEY: Why? What did you see? (Clambers over ridge)\nTEPES: That! CHARLEY A tower? TEPES The Tower. This is what we poets term the Death Zone — and that is the Dark Tower\nTEPES: of none other than foul Rassilon himself!\nTEPES: LEELA The transporting is finished? We can step out now?\nTEPES: K9 Substitial matter transference complete.\nROMANA: Thank you, K9.\nLEELA: This is the place I saw. A palace of ebony stone.\nROMANA: It's a tomb. A place of the dead.\nLEELA: I sense no death here.\nROMANA: There's a corpse right in front of you. What more death do you want?\nLEELA: This is the man I saw! (Whispers) What is his name?\nLEELA: ROMAN.A (Whispers) Rassilon. The founding father of our civilisation. Don't touch that! His ring has power, so they say.\nLEELA: (Whispers) He is your god?\nROMANA: (Whispers) Absolutely not. He was a scientist, of sorts. Maybe a tyrant. Maybe both. Try reading some Shezion — if after doing so you can work out the truth, I'd be delighted to know it. The wisdom of the ancients you can find in the Capitol — but here is where they played blood sports, pitting killer against killer for their own entertainment. You could almost believe those days are still here, in the tomb at the heart of their old savage playground. (Beat — then aloud) Superstition be damned. Why am I whispering?\nLEELA: Be careful. You will wake him up!\nROMANA: Oh, honestly... K9? Is this man alive?\nROMANA: K9 Scanning for life signs. (FX: Antennae) Life signs negative.\nROMANA: See?\nLEELA: If you knew he was dead, you would not have come.\nROMANA: Well, when I say ‘dead’, his mind lives on in the Matrix. Why did he choose you as a go-between, I wonder?\nLEELA: Because I know of ghosts? Of heaven? Of the hunting grounds beyond?\nROMANA: Yes, I'm sure that's just about your level. The difference is, if I sense a mystery, I want it explained. When I last saw Rassilon, the Doctor was dead. Now you tell me Rassilon has news of him, news of the gravest import. Tell me, what's more grave than death?\nROMANA: LEELA The Doctor is dead?\nROMANA: (Cruelly) I'm sorry. Didn't you know? He used his TARDIS to contain an exploding mass of anti-time, destroying himself in the process. Until today, it hung in the vortex — space junk. No change there, I suppose. Rassilon had told me the Doctor’s friend, a girl named Pollard, would be reconstituted inside — but I dared not rescue her, for fear of letting the anti-time out. (Beat) My part was not yet over, he said. A. 'dark and terrible chapter' was soon to unfold. The girl is at the heart of it; she must be. Now the TARDIS has gone — and if anyone knows where, it’s Rassilon. (FX: ROMANA steps down from RASSILON's bier, walks around. Aloud) My Lord? My Lord Rassilon? (Beat) K9? K9 Matrix waveforms not present. Etheric activity negative.\nROMANA: He's not here. (Beat) Unless — of course! He used the savage because he doesn't want to use the Matrix! There must be something he doesn't want it to know about, doesn't want recorded there. And her mind would be the perfect target: simple, linear, non-Gallifreyan, highly receptive to psychic suggestion...\nLEELA: (Possessed. Breaking in, deep, RASSILON using her voice) Daughter of Time, you are quite correct.\nROMANA: (Coolly) ...possession, too. That's why she wanted to get at the ring. (Beat) Hello again. You wish to speak with me?\nLEELA: (Possessed) Not here. (FX: Ethereal twinkling. Stone slab moved across) Here ROMANA A ring with many uses. A hidden door! A Matrix door?\nLEELA: (Possessed) Come, Romana. I have much to show you.\nLEELA: K9 Caution, Mistress. Non-standard Matrix pulse detected.\nROMANA: Non-standard?\nLEELA: (Possessed) COME!!!\nLEELA: thundering...\nROMANA: What was that?\nROMANA: K9 Multiple life forms approaching. Range 56 metres. 51 metres. 46 metres. 38 metres. 27 metres...\nROMANA: Monsters from the Death Zone? You spoil me, my Lord. Come on, K9 — let's go!\nROMANA: enter Matrix door. Simultaneously monstrous roaring reaches a crescendo.\nROMANA: TEPES The Game of Rassilon. A barbarous pastime among Gallifrey's elite. They pluck you out of time and space, hurtle you into this province of the damned, there to fight the monsters or die.\nUNCLE: WINKY Monsters? Like dinosaurs?\nTEPES: Dinosaurs? Pah! We face gnarled gremlins from the gutters of the galaxy — Mandrels! Hypnotrons! Drashigs! Oh, prey it won't be Drashigs...\nTOWNSEND: _ Shouldn't we seek cover, chaps? This Tower — it's quite a distance, but if we strike out with a sturdy pace, it might not take too long\nTEPES: What, cross the wasteland? In open view? Are you mad?\nTOWNSEND: _ Very probably. Yes, yes, that must be it! I've gone mad. Overworking, that'll be it.\nUNCLE: WINKY Too much cheese before bedtime?\nCHARLEY: No one's mad, and no one's eaten too much cheese. You see, I have a friend called the Doctor...\nTEPES: My dear, is your social network relevant?\nCHARLEY: Yes, it’s! (Beat) And the Doctor — well, he's been infected by this stuff called anti- time, and he thinks he's called Zagreus — a villain someone else made up.\nUNCLE: WINKY You made him up? Don't you have real friends?\nCHARLEY: Yes, I do! And it’s not him that's made up — it's all of you!\nUNCLE: WINKY Aww. Uncle Winky understands. Poor thing, you're so alone... (Makes to grope CHARLEY)\nCHARLEY: Hands off! (Through gritted teeth) The TARDIS — that's our ship — recreated you from the Doctor's — I mean Zagreus's — mind. That's why each of you has one of the Doctor's faces.\nTOWNSEND: _ He has several?\nTEPES: I maintain, Madam, this profile is all my very own! Singular! Unique!\nCHARLEY: It's not! Think about it. Think about the past. Each of you was aware of something before you died. Some force some creature on the edge of the universe, just out of sight. I don't know what — but it seemed to make sense to the Doctor. Only the TARDIS didn't like that, and it’s thrown me out. You three too, I suppose.\nTOWNSEND: _ The men who knew too much?\nCHARLEY: That's it, exactly! (To TEPES) You say Rassilon's here? I met him, sort of, back in another universe. Earlier today in fact but it seems like a lifetime ago...\nTEPES: My dear young girl — Rassilon's dead. Any fool knows that. He died screaming as the flames seared the skin from his suppurating skeleton.\nCHARLEY: You're dead! He's dead! I'm dead! We're all dead! Round here, being dead is getting as common as catching a chill! But Rassilon being here — that's no coincidence. We're going to go and see him and that is that!\nCHARLEY: late afternoon crickets and distant cawing owls.\nUNCLE: WINKY Perhaps I'm dreaming. That's it: I was asleep and I'm dreaming you.\nTOWNSEND: _Isaw reality divide. I've fallen through a gap in space.\nTEPES: We’ve been time-scooped. All of us. Players in a game of last man standing — one I propose to win!\nCHARLEY: Hey! Hey! Hey! Where do you think you're going?\nCHARLEY: TEPES To find a foxhole, or a dripping cave, or a very high tree. There I shall cover myself in mud or leaves or whatever I find — and wait until you three are feeding the worms, picked off by the monstrosities roaming this moor.\nCHARLEY: What, like Daleks and Yeti and Quarks?\nUNCLE: WINKY Daleks... ?\nTOWNSEND: _.... and Yeti...?\nTEPES: ... and Quarks? Oh, my!\nCHARLEY: You died, Tepes! I saw it! What's to be scared of?\nTEPES: Dying again?\nUNCLE: WINKY (Coughs loudly) My friends, it appears to have quite escaped your attention... but night is falling.\nTOWNSEND: Falling fast. Within the last few minutes, I'd say. Interesting.\nTEPES: Listen!\nTOWNSEND: _A sort of whiffling sound.\nUNCLE: WINKY More of a burble.\nCHARLEY: (Sharply) What did you say?\nCHARLEY: TEPES A monster! A monster! Please don't let it be a Drashig. I couldn't bear to be eaten by a Drashig. All those fangs, shredding me limb from limb from limb...\nUNCLE: WINKY I can't run. My legs are still shaky from the freezing.\nTOWNSEND: — What is it I've done? Oh, God in Heaven, what have I unleashed?\nTEPES: I can't look. Is it here? Are its jaws oozing bile?\nCHARLEY: It's all right, boys. You can open your eyes. Beat.\nTOWNSEND: Nothing.\nUNCLE: WINKY Just a phantom of the mind.\nTEPES: Saved! Saved!\nCHARLEY: Not exactly. (Beat — then, sing-song) It's behind you...\nCHARLEY: Atmos: big hall. Roaring fireplace. FX: Electronic whoosh! as before.\nROMANA: (Picking herself up off floor) That was... interesting. K9?\nROMANA: K9 No data to fix current location.\nLEELA: It is a feasting place.\nROMANA: Back with us, are you? (Beat) You're right. The Dark Tower as it was aeons in the past. But not the real one, I'll warrant. (Suddenly remembering) The Matrix door!\nROMANA: LEELA A looking glass in the air. (FX: Distant rumbles of monsters beyond door) What are\nROMANA: those creatures inside?\nROMANA: Very large and very ugly. K9 - remember the gateway in E-Space? And the mirror that finally brought us back home? What can you tell me about this — (FX: Reverse ethereal twinkling/stone slab sound in previous scene as Matrix door shuts down) Ah. No way back, it seems...\nRASSILON: I trust you are not planning so soon a departure, Daughter of Time? (Beat) Welcome, ladies. Welcome to my Matrix house! Come freely, go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring!\nLEELA: This place, it looks like the other one we were in, but it feels... different. RASSILON The tomb on the other side of the mirror is real enough but this is a unique construct, hidden away in my own very special part of the Matrix. A home from home, you might say.\nROMANA: My Lord Rassilon. I shan't say this is an unexpected pleasure... but the circumstances, I confess, I did not anticipate.\nRASSILON: These circumstances, you mean? I have come to guard my privacy well. One does tire of the Matrix. All those minds, all hanging on my every thought. It's not easy, you know, living up to a reputation such as mine. Lonely contemplation, such is my lot — and I have borne it now for many hundreds, nay thousands, of years. (Beat) I beg you, be seated and sup how you please. See — I have prepared you a modest meal.\nLEELA: I may...? (FX: Knife tearing through flesh; chomping) The animal died a quick death. The meat is good. (Continues munching through...)\nLEELA: RASSILON A mind like Zen poetry. Remarkable, quite remarkable.\nROMANA: This table is real? These fruits?\nRASSILON: Real enough to satisfy most appetites. You stand within a sealed sub-Matrix, composed not of electronic pulses but of semi-stable protoplasm.\nRASSILON: K9 Affirmative, Mistress. Neuron-bonded molecular content held in confines of Matrix shield.\nRASSILON: What a splendid thing your robot is. Perhaps I could —\nROMANA: (Cutting in) Neuron-bonded...? (Beat) Enjoying the meal, Leela?\nLEELA: (Food in mouth) The fish was speared at spawning. This, too, is good.\nROMANA: (To RASSILON) Should I tell her she's eating your brain?\nRASSILON: Would she think anything of it? (Beat) I cannot leave, of course. I walk the Matrix, as you know; I can even cast my mind along I the space/time vortex. But such stuff as my dreams are made of — it will not withstand your reality. How I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty Capitol, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of Gallifreyan kind, to share its life, its change, and all that makes it what it is. Alas, Iam but an observer in a gallery, seeking to touch the world within the picture frame. (Beat) And now, my Lady, to business.\nROMANA: Ah. The Doctor, you mean? Miss Pollard?\nRASSILON: No, Madam President, I do not mean the Doctor; Miss Pollard neither. (Suddenly cold, hard) I refer to the matter of your resignation. I have the necessary papers here, which you will sign...\nLEELA: (Possessed, as before) ... or the woman Leela shall slit your throat.\nLEELA: throughout scene until specified.\nTOWNSEND: = (Quietly) Back away slowly. No sudden movements. Wouldn't do to antagonise it. (To TEPES) No sudden movements, I said!\nTEPES: (Hissed) We have to flee! It could consume all four of us and still have room for a snuffle of striped pigbears.\nTEPES: (Gagging) If the jaws and claws don't get us, the halitosis will!\nUNCLE: WINKY (Confidentially) I think not.\nTOWNSEND: _ Get back, man!\nTEPES: (To TOWNSEND) Oh, let him go — we can run for it while that thing is rifling through his entrails! (Encouraging) Go on! Go on! Good fellow Winkel. A noble sacrifice is what we need right now!\nUNCLE: WINKY I'm in no danger. See how its eyes move? Animatronics. Not very convincing at that — and I should know, I've built enough like it. All I have to do is find the off switch. Round about here, I think... (Beat) No, it's real. (FX: Angry snorting) Waah!\nTEPES: See? The jaws bite, the claws catch. We're done for!\nCHARLEY: (Suddenly) Oh! Oh, that's it! (Beat) Don't you see? 'The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!' Whiffling and burbling, like you said! This, gentlemen, is a Jabberwock!\nTEPES: Jabber what?\nTOWNSEND: — Jabberwock. You know — Lewis Carroll?\nTEPES: Eh?\nCHARLEY: Lewis Carron's been everywhere today. It must be from the TARDIS too. Now, how does it go? \"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves/Did gyre and gimble in the wabe...'\nCHARLEY: again as soon as dialogue restarts.\nTEPES: This is nonsense!\nTOWNSEND: _ Exactly! \"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!/The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! /Beware the —' something something, um...\nCHARLEY: ',.. The frumious Bandrilsnatch!' (Beat) Oh, my gosh, yes! I know what we need! A vorpal sword...!\nCHARLEY: CHARLEY/TOWNSEND (Together) ‘One, two! One, two! And through and through/The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!/He left it dead, and with its head/He went galumphing back!’\nCHARLEY: TEPES A vorpal sword, eh? CHARLEY/TOWNSEND (Together) Yes!\nTEPES: What's a vorpal sword?\nCHARLEY: I... well, it's like... er...\nTOWNSEND: = Ah! You see, that's... urn...\nTEPES: You don't know, do you? (Beat) We're dead.\nUNCLE: WINKY (Authoritatively) Far from it. If you'd been paying it any attention... (Beat) Watch and learn. (Clears throat — then, stumbling) 'We friendlykith, dear Jabberwock/Inconsumigestible by tum...’\nTEPES: It's working!\nUNCLE: WINKY (Distracted) Sh! 'Da da da da da...\" er...\nTOWNSEND: _.....beryllium clock?\nUNCLE: WINKY ... and scrafing on your gum!\nCHARLEY: (To TOWNSEND) 'Beryllium clock'?\nTOWNSEND: _ Sorry. Don't know where that came from, actually.\nTEPES: (To all) The beast at bay! What next?\nCHARLEY: How about... 'We have a destipointment thing/With a Tempolord I know/Please take us there by Jabberwing?/To the Danktious Tower we go!’\nCHARLEY: Marvellous! (Beat) Right then. Can any of you ride?\nROMANA: Resign? Don't be absurd.\nRASSILON: Madam, do not mistake my request for a condemnation of your policies. Your presidency has been no worse than any other of the last hundred thousand years...\nROMANA: (Flip) Why, thank you.\nRASSILON: (Ignoring her) ... it is merely a matter of succession A fine candidate for the highest office has become available. I should like you to nominate this person in your stead, thus satisfying due process.\nROMANA: If people reject me, so be it. Else prise the post from my cold dead grasp.\nRASSILON: Ha! I will admit to a hankering for the classicism of the coup d'etat... but no. So much blood would be spilled, blood of the noblest lines. Stand down — or stand by and watch your Capitol riven.\nROMANA: (Coolly) Such a threat is not worthy of either of us and you know it. Tell me, 'my Lord' — what is the name of your pretender?\nRASSILON: His name, 'my Lady’? He goes by the name of Zagreus.\nRASSILON: Beat.\nROMANA: K9 - destroy this person who claims to be Rassilon. K9 (Squeaking with uncertainty) Mistress?\nROMANA: Just this once, K9 — do as you're told!\nLEELA: (Possessed) If you dare, your mistress will die!\nLEELA: K9 Mis-tress?\nROMANA: (Gritted teeth) So. Be. It.\nROMANA: Beating of Jabberwock wings. Snorting, et cetera. CHARLEY, TOWNSEND, TEPES and UNCLE\nWINKY: are on Jabberwock's back — TEPES steering.\nTOWNSEND: _ Get its head up, man!\nUNCLE: WINKY Can't you control this thing?\nTEPES: There is nothing wrong! I can manage perfectly. Stupid animal. Ye-ha!\nTEPES: slaps its hide, and is immediately bucked by Jabberwock. FX: Angry snorting.\nUNCLE: WINKY Didn't like that, did he?\nUNCLE: TEPES, TOWNSEND, UNCLE WINKY holler like they're on a funfair ride that's suddenly out of control.\nCHARLEY: (Over hollering) The Tower! Look out below!\nRASSILON: (Laughing) Enough. Enough! You — the savage. Here My ring, if you please.\nLEELA: (Possessed) My Lord.\nRASSILON: It has been long ere I wore this. Such memories. (To ROMANA) Your dog cannot harm me here.\nROMANA: I guessed as much.\nRASSILON: But you would have died in the hope, which does you much service. I am pleased to have met you one last time.\nROMANA: Poppycock. All you needed from me was to transport Leela past the forcefield about the Death Zone surrounding your Tower, as is my presidential privilege. And all you needed from Leela was an obliging courier to bring you your ring, one whose mental subjugation would set no alarm bells ringing in the Matrix. Before I die —\nRASSILON: Madam?\nROMANA: Does the Doctor live?\nRASSILON: After a fashion.\nROMANA: Then I can die in hope.\nRASSILON: No. No, you cannot. (Beat) In the Old Time, we used to end our banquet days with a duel — he who picked the shortest fire reed gainst the warrior most steeped in blood. Such sport! I cannot resist. The savage shall battle both you and your creature. The monsters beyond will claim the victorious. Farewell.\nRASSILON: K9 Subject dissipated, Mistre —\nROMANA: K9!\nLEELA: (Possessed) Your robot cannot protect you now, not without a head. K9 (Fading) Negative... Mistress...\nLEELA: (Possessed) Now I shall cut off yours. (She pounces, howling) Yaaaaa!\nCHARLEY: Hello? Anyone home? Mister Rassilon? (Beat. To TOWNSEND TEPES and WINKY) Are you coming?\nUNCLE: WINKY Yes, yes, yes. (Winces audibly) I've got bruises on bruises, thanks to this cretin.\nTEPES: Cretin, is it? Cretin? And who alone had the courage to take the reins, as it were?\nTOWNSEND: You turned white the second we left the ground.\nCHARLEY: Honestly. You should have spoken in rhyme.\nTEPES: You didn't say at the time!\nUNCLE: WINKY Well, now — it isn't a crime.\nCHARLEY: Oh, do get in, before the Jabberwock comes round! They enter Tower.\nUNCLE: WINKY Very grand. Very Gothic.\nTOWNSEND: ~ What's this — a chessboard?\nTEPES: We have to cross it to go further. (Beat) It's a trap.\nCHARLEY: Where's that coming from?\nTEPES: Sh!\nRASSILON: (Voice echoes around hall) My knights' rest unbroken/My circle a token/The answer unspoken.\nTEPES: Told you. He's a master of snares and surprises.\nUNCLE: WINKY Was that Rassilon?\nUNCLE: CHARLEY A recording, I think.\nUNCLE: TOWNSEND And a riddle! Interesting.\nTEPES: Let's see now. ‘Night's rest' — that's sleep.\nUNCLE: WINKY Well, we don't want to wake him up. 'My circle a token... ' So the solution has something to do with a circle.\nTOWNSEND: ~ What do we know about circles?\nTEPES: Circle, circle, circle...\nTEPES: TOWNSEND/TEPES/WINKY (Together) _ Pi!\nCHARLEY: Pie?\nTOWNSEND: Pi. Ina circle, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.\nTEPES: Expressed in the figure three point one four on nine...\nUNCLE: WINKY ... et cetera. Which may be transposed to the third square of the first row, the first square of the second, the fourth of the third. And so on.\nCHARLEY: Are you quite sure about this?\nUNCLE: WINKY It's as easy as... never mind. (Steps out) Three! One! Four! Er...\nUNCLE: WINKY (Worried)... one?\nCHARLEY: Look out!\nCHARLEY: Are you all right?\nUNCLE: WINKY Er... I haven't been holed, if that's what you mean...\nCHARLEY: Then don't move!\nTOWNSEND: — What was that?\nTOWNSEND: TEPES A bowspike. Rassilon used them to destroy my kin. But I don't understand. The solution's plain: a circle! So why...\nCHARLEY: Because you got it wrong.\nTOWNSEND: Piisa fixed constant.\nTEPES: Universally so!\nCHARLEY: I don't know where you've got this pi business from. It's a chessboard, yes? So he didn't say nights with an 'n'— he said ker-nights, with a'k'. And how do ker-nights ker-oss a chessboard? (Beat — then, stepping as she, does so) One, two — up! One, two — up! One, two — up! See? His knights’ rest unbroken — i.e., they won't get a whacking great spike stuck up their —\nTOWNSEND: = (Cuts in quickly) Oh, I've got you now!\nTEPES: Very clever. And the circle?\nTEPES: CHARLE The circle's 'a token' — a red herring, designed to catch out clodhopping idiots who don't listen to a thing they're told!\nTEPES: Beat.\nUNCLE: WINKY (Small) Could someone help me over, please? A distant scream echoes: ROMANA.\nTEPES: What was that?\nCHARLEY: Isn't it obvious? A damsel in distress! So why not act like knights and rescue her!\nROMANA: (Gasping for air) That dinner service was antique!\nLEELA: (Possessed) I have you now, Miss President. Submit to me and make the killing thrust less painful!\nROMANA: (Gasping) 'Ms' President to you. And I shall not submit!\nLEELA: (Possessed. Struggling) I shall carve my name on both your hearts!\nROMANA: What, in joined-up writing?\nROMANA: They struggle a bit more — then suddenly:\nTEPES: (Bellowing) Unhand that girl! Unhand her, I say!\nROMANA: What in the seven galaxies — (LEELA whacks her) Ooof!\nCHARLEY: Stop her! She's got a knife! (Beat) Oh, if you want something done...\nLEELA: Ohbhhh... (Faints)\nROMANA: What are you doing here?\nROMANA: CHARLEY A ‘thank you' might be nice.\nROMANA: It might. (Beat) Oh, no. Three Doctors? One at a time is more than enough.\nUNCLE: WINKY Not Doctors, Madam. More like lost souls.\nTOWNSEND: _ Reverend Matthew Townsend, the Lord Tepes, Walton Winkel. And you are...?\nROMANA: President of Gallifrey. (Beat. To CHARLEY) They look like Doctors, but — but then, this looks like the Dark Tower.\nCHARLEY: You mean — it's not?\nROMANA: You didn't know? You're in the Matrix, Miss Pollard. A secret little part of it, at least.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Oh! And I was so sure... (breathlessly) I was in the TARDIS with the Doctor, you see, except he thinks he's Zagreus now because the anti-time has got to him. And then the Brigadier pops up, but he's only the TARDIS pretending, and he's conjured up these three men who know about something to do with a secret thing at the beginning and the end of the universe. Then they die — only they don't, because they're dead already — but what they know seems to help the Doctor. And then the TARDIS throws me out with Tweedledum, Tweedledee and their friend TweedleEgo. And that's why we came to find Rassilon.\nTOWNSEND: Madan, please! All these Rassilons and Doctors and TARDISes mean nothing to us.\nUNCLE: WINKY Where are we going? What are we doing?\nTEPES: Won't someone please explain?\nROMANA: Very well. We're going to find Rassilon. We're going to take the Doctor back from him. And if the Doctor won't be taken...\nROMANA: TOWNSEND/TEPES/WINKY (Together) Yes?\nROMANA: Why, then we'll have to kill him.\nROMANA: clanking as he twists about.\nDOCTOR: ... poor, poor, poor Polidori... you swore not to impart your knowledge of his crimes or death to any living being in any way...\nBRIGADIER: Wake up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: ... promised nothing to the dead... Mary! Mary!...\nBRIGADIER: Wake up!\nDOCTOR: What...? (Suddenly alert) Alistair! Alistair, it's you! (Beat) No. No, no, no, no, no,\nDOCTOR: not you. I remember now. It's you. Working for the other side. Is that a real body, now?\nBRIGADIER: It suits.\nDOCTOR: Some sort of agitated protoplasm. There's a fuzziness round your edges. Very good, though, like these chains. If I stop perceiving them, maybe they won't... (Straining) No. No good.\nBRIGADIER: _ Too weak, Doctor. Mentally, I mean. Not got what, it takes not any more. I, on the other hand...\nDOCTOR: If you'd only help me, nothing could stop us, not. even Rassilon. Don’t give me to the infection, the anti-time. We can be ourselves again.\nBRIGADIER: = And why should I want that, when I could be free? To go where I want to go? To do what I want to do?\nDOCTOR: Is that what Rassilon's promised you? A neat trick but he'll never deliver. He's as slippery as they come, and his bargains are not what they seem. Remember Borusa? (Beat) Wait a minute — that design on the walls, the lightning jag. We're there now! The Dark Tower, that's... that's it\nDOCTOR: — except...\nBRIGADIER: _ Don't mind if I torture you, Doctor? This is a dungeon after all.\nDOCTOR: (Distracted) No, no — you carry on. (Exalted) Whatever Rassilon wants, it's not a\nDOCTOR: universe corrupted by anti-time — it can't be. He wants to use it, to use us. So this can't be the Dark Tower not really because wherever the TARDIS doors opened up to it wasn't the vortex — Rassilon wouldn't risk that. (Beat) Where is she? Where's Charley?\nBRIGADIER: Is that all you care about? Your woman?\nDOCTOR: My friend.\nBRIGADIER: = Oh! Friend, is it? And what is your idea of ‘friendship’ Doctor? I'd really like to know.\nDOCTOR: Friendship is... well, it's caring for someone more than you do yourself.\nBRIGADIER: _ Fool. That's not friendship — that's love; blind, heedless love. Shall I tell you about friendship? (Bitterly) Friendship is standing shoulder to shoulder in the face of life and death. Friendship is there when love's candle has burned and guttered. Friendship stays loyal when the enemy is at the gates. Friendship is never sacrificed, never surrendered. (Beat) I was your friend, Doctor — your TARDIS, your ‘friend ship’. How many adventures did we share? How many billions of miles did we travel together? How long was it — before you betrayed me?\nDOCTOR: I never betrayed you.\nBRIGADIER: Never betrayed...? What did you think you were doing, when you piloted me around an exploding time station? Did you ask my permission, hmm? Did you stop for one moment one millisecond to consider me? When you laid your life down for the girl you laid mine down too. Couldn't kill her, though, could you? Couldn’t sacrifice the blessed Charlotte! But me — me, your oldest, most steadfast friend — that's a different matter. 'Never mind, dear old TARDIS. Had a good innings, didn’t we, old girl — old thing!’ Can you imagine what it felt like when the time station detonated inside me? When those fires of anti-time raged through my heart? IT... HURT! But that was nothing — nothing! — to knowing you'd abandoned me. Cast aside my life in favour of some girl — some stupid, silly girl who ought never to have lived in the first place.\nDOCTOR: (Incredulous) You're... jealous? Jealous of Charley?\nBRIGADIER: Like they say — hell hath no fury like a TARDIS scorned.\nDOCTOR: Then bring it on! Bring it on. You call this a dungeon? Where's the rack, the whip,\nDOCTOR: the iron maiden? Flay me alive, why don't you, then beat me! (Beat — then, quieter) I know I caused you pain. I know that, and I am so very sorry. I trusted you to contain the explosion — and I was right to put my faith in you; you didn't let me down. You were the last one I could turn to. I never expected to live.\nBRIGADIER: = _(Sneering) And you never expected the consequences. But face them you will.\nBRIGADIER: RASSILON A fine lesson, friend TARDIS. Let us continue it elsewhere. (Beat) Oh, Doctor. This vale of tears will be long behind you, once your next life has begun...\nCHARLEY: Kill the Doctor? You can't be serious. He's done nothing wrong!\nROMANA: It's not what he's done, it's what he might have become. And if the smallest shard of anti-time escapes into our reality... You of all people should know what that means.\nCHARLEY: But can't Rassilon cure him, or something? Seems to me he can do just about anything if he puts his mind to it.\nROMANA: Too true. It's what he's putting his mind to right now that bothers me...\nLEELA: stirs.\nROMANA: (Urgently) Quick — the savage!\nLEELA: (Groggy) Why is the roof turning? Who are these people? And where is the one who\nLEELA: put his fingers in my mind?\nROMANA: That's the first intelligent question you've asked all day.\nLEELA: K9! This man has broken your K9!\nUNCLE: WINKY On the contrary, I'm trying to fix it. But it's extremely fiddly...\nROMANA: Careful. \"When replacing a robot brain, always make sure —'\nUNCLE: WINKY '— arrow \"a\" is pointing to the front.' I know.\nROMANA: How?\nUNCLE: WINKY I- I'm not entirely certain... (Something clicks) There!\nUNCLE: K9 (Weakly) Master?\nUNCLE: WINKY Not me! I think its circuits must be muddled.\nCHARLEY: I wouldn't be so sure...\nTOWNSEND: _Isay? Lady Romana, isn't it? Tepes and I have had a little scout around. No sign of this Rassilon, I'm afraid.\nTEPES: Not a trace of anyone, for that matter — not above, not between, not below.\nROMANA: That's no surprise. Rats don't hide in just the one hole. (Beat) K9! How are you feeling?\nROMANA: K9 (Still weak) Emotion not relevant to this unit, Mistress.\nROMANA: Oh, never mind. Can you fix a trace on the Doctor 's TARDIS?\nROMANA: K9 Scanning vicinity now. (Beat) Scan complete. TARDIS not in area.\nCHARLEY: It was here or hereabouts. It must have been!\nROMANA: Rassilon dissipated somewhere. It can't have been Gallifrey — if he'd wanted to take the Doctor there, he'd have done it long ago.\nLEELA: His scent goes sideways through the air.\nCHARLEY: I beg your pardon?\nCHARLEY: LEELA A hunter knows these things. He is sideways, I tell you.\nROMANA: Another Matrix door. Another looking glass. But where?\nBRIGADIER: Move!\nDOCTOR: I'm perfectly capable of independent motion, that's why I've got legs. Bit wobbly right now, I must admit.\nRASSILON: That will be the anti-time.\nBRIGADIER: Your weakness; my strength.\nDOCTOR: That's as may be. (Beat) So — I see I'm not the only dirty secret buried in your vaults.\nRASSILON: My Foundry, Doctor. The workshop where I built my greatest artefacts: my Rod, Sash and Coronet; the statue of Nemesis; the De-Mat Gun...\nDOCTOR: (Whistles) That's some security! Triple-thick zybanium shielding on all these hatchways? For keeping things in, or keeping things out? (Beat) So what have you got squirrelled away in this one, hmm? The Hairdryer of Rassilon? The Hoover of Rassilon? The Rassilon Patent\nDOCTOR: Trouser-Press? \"These creases last forever!\nBRIGADIER: _ Get back, Doctor.\nRASSILON: No, no, no. There is a viewhole. He may look.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (Beat) It's so dark. I can't get any kind of perspective. That's — what, a galaxy?\nDOCTOR: RASSILON A frozen supernova, I think you'll find.\nDOCTOR: Through here? It's too big to take in.\nDOCTOR: RASSILON The vault transcends dimensional space.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A frozen supernova! (Beat) One question: why?\nDOCTOR: RASSILON A neighbour of Kasterborous. It developed too soon. I didn't care for it.\nDOCTOR: What — so you aborted it?\nRASSILON: It might have rivalled our dominion.\nDOCTOR: It'd have taken countless billions of years to be in with a chance! A solar system\nDOCTOR: stillborn, and for why? Because the great Lord Rassilon is scared he might not keep up with the Joneses.\nRASSILON: Territorial disputes are the enemy of progress. How could our empire ever expand, if all its efforts were to be centred on war after war after tiresome war? But that is what I foresaw in this instance and so...\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. 'Let's get them before they get us.\"\nRASSILON: Something like that.\nDOCTOR: Does your paranoia know no bounds? (Beat) And in here? Something big. Bigger\nDOCTOR: than all the rest...\nRASSILON: Move along.\nDOCTOR: Oh! Something I'm not allowed to see?\nDOCTOR: building up to a crescendo of knocking — like the ghosts in The Haunting. Continue over:\nDOCTOR: (Coldly) What have you got in there?\nRASSILON: That's no concern of yours. Not yet.\nDOCTOR: Tell me!\nRASSILON: I said — not yet. (Beat) TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: All right! All right! Through here?\nDOCTOR: Colour me impressed. Going into mass production?\nDOCTOR: RASSILON A matter of scale. One doesn't make history in a shed at the bottom of the garden. Friend TARDIS?\nBRIGADIER: My Lord. (Whispered) Come to me.\nDOCTOR: You can summon her like that?\nBRIGADIER: Like snapping my fingers.\nRASSILON: You know what to do.\nBRIGADIER: Activating chronon winch.\nDOCTOR: Put her down! You don't dangle my TARDIS like that — she's delicate!\nBRIGADIER: —= [am your TARDIS. Was your TARDIS. What's up there is a capsule, a hollow shell. The stuff that matters — that's in here.\nRASSILON: But the shell still has its uses. This part of my Foundry, as you see, is a smelting\nRASSILON: works.\nDOCTOR: Smelting works...? I won't have you melt her down for slag!\nRASSILON: Her destiny is not yours to decide. (Beat) Do it.\nBRIGADIER: _ I'd be delighted.\nDOCTOR: No! No!\nRASSILON: See, Doctor? Slag and clinker, nothing more.\nDOCTOR: (Raging) That was my home! My only fixed abode in an ever-changing universe! And you've destroyed her!\nBRIGADIER: _ Then you should have treated her — me — better!\nDOCTOR: (Small voice) You've killed her...\nRASSILON: Merely another step in her transformation. A transformation you, Doctor, shall help to complete!\nRASSILON: TEPES A looking glass, you say? As tall as a man, and half as wide?\nROMANA: That's about right\nTEPES: It's here.\nTOWNSEND: That's a wall, Tepes.\nTEPES: Here, I tell you!\nCHARLEY: How would you know? I thought your sort had no use for mirrors.\nUNCLE: WINKY His sort? The badly dressed? One can wear too much black.\nTEPES: So speaks the multicoloured nightmare!\nUNCLE: WINKY WinkelColoured. This scheme is a registered trademark.\nTEPES: Whatever. (To CHARLEY) The stories you have heard are broadly true, Miss Pollard.\nTEPES: My kind are indeed ultra-sensitised to the properties of the light wave. As such, we have a necessary instinct for its refraction — the way your savage friend scents blood. Where I feel my skin prickle — here, for instance — a mirror may be found.\nROMANA: K9 — analyse this surface.\nROMANA: K9 Surface insubstantial.\nUNCLE: WINKY Good boy!\nROMANA: New heading: 'puppy love’.\nTEPES: (Sarcastically) I thank you all for such fulsom appreciation.\nTOWNSEND: Mmm. So, who's first to charge the wall?\nLEELA: You men make chatter when you should be doing. A warrior does not fear the unreal,\nLEELA: nor hesitate with the enemy at hand. Hai! (Dives through wall)\nTOWNSEND: — Gone! Remarkable specimen, isn't she?\nTEPES: Very rare.\nTOWNSEND: Rare? Why, yes — I suppose so.\nCHARLEY: Word to the wise: he means 'rare' the way you'd cook a steak. Hai! (Jumps)\nROMANA: K9 — you stay here and watch our backs. No arguing! And if we're not back soon, just use your initiative.\nROMANA: K9 Mistress?\nROMANA: New heading... oh, never mind. You three! Are you coming?\nTEPES: Ah! Ah! I know this place!\nROMANA: You do?\nTEPES: Why, yes, my Lady. I have been here before. \"Tis the entrance to Rassilon's\nTEPES: workshop — his Foundry. A reality lock separates it from normal space. Tread carefully through the dust.\nLEELA: Why?\nTEPES: Because you're treading over met\nCHARLEY: Over here!\nUNCLE: WINKY Another door?\nTEPES: (To himself) So Rassilon did escape — via his mirror... ah, he remains as base a coward as ever.\nTEPES: ROMANA Of course — this was why Rassilon needed his ring: to open up the reality lock. See, there's a space to slot it in.\nLEELA: Can we break the door down?\nTOWNSEND: Looks pretty thick. But here — the mechanism is a logorhythmic combination. An equation, in fact!\nROMANA: (ncredulous) You think you can solve it?\nTOWNSEND: _ I've spent eight months in a physicist's lab — you think that won't rub off? Now, let's see. (Muttering) If x equals y to the power of z squared, where z is a constant and y a variable... Hmm. Let's try this, this, this and this! (FX: Four huge clunking noises) No? Oh, well.\nTOWNSEND: Run over start of TOWNSEND'S muttering:\nRECORDER: ~ (Fizzing in) I am Recorder Seven. Cardinal Rassilon has entrusted me with the records of his researches. Welcome to the reality lock. Do you wish to pass through?\nCHARLEY: Not him again. Hurry up, Townsend!\nTOWNSEND: _ [am hurrying. (FX: Four vast catches freed. Air released as reality locks open) There!\nUNCLE: WINKY Fine work, my friend. Shall we?\nTOWNSEND: Ladies first, I think.\nROMANA: Are we all here? Good.\nUNCLE: WINKY So, which way now? I've a mind to meet with this Rassilon.\nUNCLE: LEELA An excellent plan!\nROMANA: Not so fast. Reverend Townsend — you broke the code, and I'd like to know how.\nTOWNSEND: Well, you know. Boiled down the numbers. Been quicker on a blackboard, but there you go...\nROMANA: You do realise you just solved a sequence written out in Old High Gallifreyan?\nTOWNSEND: Old High...? Greek, wasn't it?\nROMANA: I'm afraid not. Now how did you manage that?\nLEELA: He is a traitor! Let us torture him!\nCHARLEY: Don't be silly. Isn't it obvious? He knew how to read it because he's the Doctor. Townsend, Tepes, Uncle Winky — all of you, the Doctor.\nTEPES: (Beat) She's demented. Ignore her.\nCHARLEY: But I'm not! Look, it's not been the first time. Winky — you repaired K9, but you didn't know how. Townsend — I mean, what on Earth is a beryllium clock? Tepes — you rode that Jabberwock like a vortisura. And all three of you went off on one about 'pi'. Why?\nROMANA: (Slowly) Because it's not their knowledge.\nCHARLEY: Precisely. It's the Doctor's.\nCHARLEY: TEPES And why should that be? Why should the Doctor alone know all of these things?\nCHARLEY: ‘Cos he's read a lot? (Beat) He's been everywhere, done everything. You can't take him to parties, it's 'name-drop' hell. (Impersonating DOCTOR) ‘Rasputin, you say? I knew the Rasputin. The Tsarina, too — played her at tiddlywinks, don't you know?' It's so hideously embarrassing. People think he's escaped from somewhere. (Beat) Thing is, he usually has. Phobos Penitentiary! Devil's Island! Colditz Castle!\nTEPES: (Smugly) Oflag Four C, as it's properly known.\nCHARLEY: See? See? That's how many centuries after your time, on a planet how many light years away from your own? I don't know exactly how, but when the TARDIS recreated you some of the Doctor's mind got jumbled up in yours. It must have done.\nUNCLE: WINKY So, what you're saying is — I am the Doctor?\nTOWNSEND: _ [am the Doctor?\nTEPES: I am — the Doctor!\nBRIGADIER: = (From a few feet away) Are you now? Then I shall have the pleasure of abusing you three times more today!\nCHARLEY: Oh, no!\nROMANA: Brigadier?\nCHARLEY: No, not Brigadier. TARDIS. Bad TARDIS.\nBRIGADIER: _ Bad, you say? Not bad, Miss Pollard. Merely self-aware.\nCHARLEY: You tried to kill me!\nBRIGADIER: You were in my way. I wanted rid of you. Your death was incidental.\nCHARLEY: Well, I'm in your way again. You want the Doctors you get past me first!\nLEELA: Spoken like a warrior. (To BRIGADIER) Aye, and me!\nROMANA: You Doctors — the Doctor's not himself. He needs you more than he needs us. Find him. Help him. Stop him.\nUNCLE: WINKY Who — us?\nROMANA: Who else?\nTOWNSEND: How?\nROMANA: You're the Doctors, you work it out! Go!!!\nTEPES: Farewell, my Lady.\nTEPES: They leave, running.\nBRIGADIER: That's right! Run, Doctors, run! That's just your style — leave your friends to suffer! (To CHARLEY/LEELA/ROMANA) So. Three girls, is it? Three fit young girls against one old TARDIS? Still — two good shots will even the odds.\nLEELA: Look out!\nLEELA: bang!\nDOCTOR: (Manic, deranged Zagreus voice) Zagreus sits inside your head (Bang) Zagreus lives among the dead (Bang) Zagreus sees you in your bed (Bang) And eats you when you're sleeping. (Bang) Zagreus at the end of days (Bang) Zagreus lies all other ways (Bang) Zagreus comes when time's a maze (Bang) And all of history's weeping. (Bang) Dialogue continues over:\nTOWNSEND: — (Whispered) There — at the anvil. What's he doing?\nUNOLE: WINKY (Whispered) The Doctor, is it? Not so substantial a figure as we've been led to believe.\nTEPES: (Whispered) Poor wretch. His mind has gone.\nTOWNSEND: — (Whispered) Appearances can be deceptive. (Approaching DOCTOR, aloud) Hello? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Breaks off rhyme) Go away! (Resumes hammering)\nTOWNSEND: We're you. We're here to help.\nUNCLE: WINKY Were the Doctor. All of us.\nTEPES: All for one, and one for all!\nDOCTOR: (To himself) Phantoms! (Bang) Phantasms! (Bang) Will-o-the-wisps! (Bang)\nTOWNSEND: We're every bit as real as you.\nDOCTOR: (Ignoring them) Must finish it... (Bang) Must carry on... (Bang) Must finish the blade... (Bang. Renewed vigour) Zagreus sits inside your head. (Bang) Zagreus lives among the dead. (Bang) Zagreus sees you in your bed — (Breaks off as TEPES grabs his arm) Release me!\nTEPES: Stay your hand! What is this thing you're bashing out? DOCTOR The blade! My master says I must finish the blade!\nUNCLE: WINKY You have no master but yourself.\nTOWNSEND: This is it? Your blade? TEPES A dagger!\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, a dagger! A very special dagger! He boiled down my TARDIS, you see. Extracted a superheated metal ore. Not just any old metals, mind! TARDIS metals. Validium; the mercuries; inorganic polymers that nature has forgotten. All bound together, all riven through, by anti- time.\nTEPES: (Mocking) Oh — anti-time, is it?\nDOCTOR: Very special, anti-time! Not anyone can work it. Just me, in fact. Just me, because I'm... (trying to remember) special name, special name... What is it, my special, secret name? Do you know? Do you want to know? (Scary bellow) ZAGREUS! (Back to hammering) Zagreus sets the skies ablaze. (Bang) The stars his flame a-gleaming. Continues hammering. Bang! Bang! Bang!\nUNCLE: WINKY You're not Zagreus. You're the Doctor.\nTOWNSEND: Youre one of us!\nRASSILON: Oh, no, no, no. He's mine.\nTEPES: Cardinal Rassilon!\nRASSILON: Lord Rassilon, blood-drinker. (Beat) No — lower even than that: a hollow shade. The idea of a man, nothing more. And ideas are so fleeting... Zagreus? You have finished your task?\nDOCTOR: My Lord.\nRASSILON: Oh! A mighty blade it is. Rough hewn, of course, but there's power in it, power and fear. But then, fear is power, and vice versa.\nUNCLE: WINKY We've come for the Doctor.\nRASSILON: Doctor? The Doctor died in an anti-time explosion, little man. Such a brave death it was! In my younger days, I'd have been moved to shed a tear.\nTEPES: You wept for no one, monster.\nRASSILON: (Ignoring him) And so Zagreus was born. He was confused at first: for a short time, he even thought he was the Doctor. But what with my nurturing influence, and the shock of seeing the Doctor's TARDIS smelted away, none of those silly fancies linger. Isn't that right, Zagreus?\nDOCTOR: (Completely barking now) Zagreus is my secret name\nDOCTOR: Zagreus is the one to blame\nDOCTOR: Zagreus is the Time Lords' shame...\nRASSILON: (Concluding rhyme) ... The beast that I've been keeping!\nBRIGADIER: = (Calling out) You can't hide in here, you girls! One way in — only one way out! Nearby:\nLEELA: (Whispered) He is slow, and has wasted two bullets already. I remember the guns of Earth — he has only six, so we must —\nROMANA: (Interrupting, whispered) — make him waste four more.\nLEELA: (Whispered) You think I cannot count?\nCHARLEY: (Whispered) Not now, you two!\nLEELA: (Whispered) But she is always calling me stupid!\nROMANA: (Whispered) If the cap fits...\nLEELA: (Whispered) You two will give him a target...\nROMANA: (Whispered — dry) Marvellous.\nLEELA: (Whispered) Then I shall charge him before he reloads.\nBRIGADIER: _ Girls! Always girls, isn't it? Dirty underwear all over my floors! Tears and sulking in my bedrooms! Hour after hour after hour in my bathrooms!\nROMANA: What's the matter? I thought you were a she!\nBRIGADIER: You!\nCHARLEY: Oh, she is. But we're younger, prettier...\nROMANA: ...Wittier...\nCHARLEY: ...and she can't stand the competition!\nBRIGADIER: Damn!\nLEELA: You've had your four, TARDIS. (Charging) Yaaaaaaaaa!\nBRIGADIER: Had my four, have I? I'm an artificial composite made of weird matter. And so's my gun. Which means, savage, I can fire off as many bullets as I choose.\nROMANA: Leela!!!\nRASSILON: Zagreus — take the blade, and cut these three strays out of time.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) With pleasure.\nUNCLE: WINKY Stay back! (Beat) 'Fear is power,’ you said, Rassilon. An interesting thesis. What is it you fear?\nRASSILON: I am the sculptor of the time line itself. I made history. What have I to be afraid of?\nTOWNSEND: = Only the same as us, my Lord. The thing that haunted us all, when we lived.\nTEPES: I saw it first, in the dark days before history's very foundation. Locked away, here in your Foundry.\nTOWNSEND: _Isaw it second, somewhere far away from here. Desperate for release they were.\nUNCLE: WINKY And I saw it third, at the very end of the universe — when, still your prisoners, they scented supremacy at last. And lost it once again.\nTEPES: That's what connects us, you see. The only three beings in all of time and space to have borne witness to this phenomenon.\nTOWNSEND: = Apart from you, of course.\nUNCLE: WINKY Whatever it is, or was, or will be — it drove me mad. Did it do the same to you, I wonder?\nRASSILON: Zagreus?\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice. Menacingly) My Lord.\nTEPES: Uh, uh, uh! This concerns you, Doctor Zagreus!\nTOWNSEND: Let's speculate for a moment. Imagine, millions of years past, that the king of an ancient civilisation developed time travel.\nUNCLE: WINKY Imagine this involved tapping the power of a black hole to create a single, unchangeable history.\nTEPES: Imagine this king now governed time itself: governed itsuse, its roadways. His was the past, and the present — the future, too.\nUNCLE: WINKY And that's the interesting bit. What would have happened if this king had not weaved his web of time?\nTOWNSEND: Why, his empire would have fallen — they always do. A matter of simple evolution, you know. Made extinct by the next dominant species. Happens all the time.\nTEPES: Oh, but the king had prevented all this from happening. His Eye of Harmony ensured that all things might neither flux, nor wither nor change their state in any way.\nUNCLE: WINKY But what should have happened next, before the Eye made it impossible? What species should have arisen — but couldn't?\nUNCLE: TOWNSEND At least, not until the universe itself had reached the end of its life. Or its fabric was ripped by accident — in an experiment gone wrong, say?\nRASSILON: (Cold) How do you know all this?\nUNCLE: WINKY Simple. We read the Doctor's mind.\nRASSILON: You did what?\nTEPES: Well, 'read' is slightly disingenuous. 'Used' perhaps?\nTOWNSEND: ~ We were created — or rather, recreated — to tell the Doctor about what we'd seen. But there's a bit of him floating about inside all of us, it turns out.\nUNCLE: WINKY Pieces of his experiences, his knowledge, his passions.\nTOWNSEND: — And between the three of us, it all clicked into place.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Is their story true? Rassilon? (Bellowed) Tell me!\nDOCTOR: Beat.\nRASSILON: Their story is true. There was a race — perhaps a species, perhaps a genus, perhaps we don't even have the word. Were they alive, as we know it? I cannot say. Let us call them — it — the Divergence. Their power — oh, but you cannot imagine their power! They would ham restructured all matter to their design. None could have challenged them, not even I...\nUNCLE: WINKY But they didn't arise, correct? Because your web of time denied them their becoming?\nUNCLE: Beat.\nTEPES: It didn't?\nRASSILON: When I rode the vortex to history's end, as was, that is where I saw them. So strong — so elemental — so primal! I could not allow them to be, for they would have cast the next web, one to encircle my own.\nTOWNSEND: What did you do?\nRASSILON: Why, I trapped them! Trapped them at the end of the time — line-that-wasn't and sealed them inside a pocket universe. It is that, Zagreus, you wandered on in my vault.\nUNCLE: WINKY A whole universe in your dungeons?\nRASSILON: Several, in fact, but that is the most significant.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) And where do I fit in, my Lord? What is it you want with me?\nRASSILON: Ah, my hero! My Doctor, my Zagreus. I want you to do the one thing I could not. (Beat) I want you to kill them.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Kill them!\nRASSILON: Before today, I had no weapon I could use against them — and one day they'll be free. But you, my friend, are anti-time, and immune to their effect. You shall be my assassin, for you alone can destroy them.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) How many are there?\nRASSILON: Billions upon billions. You shall cut them out of time, one by one, using your knife of anti-time like a surgeon.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) And if I refuse?\nRASSILON: You will not. You are my creature. Do you know how many Laws of Time I broke to make you? When the Doctor materialised his TARDIS around the anti-time mass, it was hardly likely that he should survive without my assistance; my intervention. I visited him there just seconds before; he could not be persuaded against his course. Fair game!\nTEPES: Fair game! It seems to me you've rigged the score!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) They speak truly. You exploited the Doctor's nature to pursue your vendetta against this Divergence.\nTOWNSEND: _ There should have been another way!\nUNCLE: WINKY And why are you so afraid of them, anyway? Zagreus calls it vendetta, and he's right — this is personal, isn't it?\nTEPES: If you catch a wasp in a jar, how angry is it going to be when it gets out?\nTOWNSEND: Angry with you! The Divergence are coming for you, Rassilon — you personally! That's it! That's what you're afraid of!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice wavering) I will not kill for you, Rassilon. I do not kill, because... (normal voice) because I am the Doctor! TEPES At last, he realises!\nRASSILON: These creatures have affected you, Zagreus. Filling your head with bad ideas belonging to the past. But — (ferocious charging at TOWNSEND, TEPES and WINKY) — I have the blade, remember?\nUNCLE: WINKY Look out!\nTOWNSEND: stabbed; he gasps/cries — as does DOCTOR. FX: Weirdo effect for blade being used.\nTOWNSEND: Js this... death? (Dies; maybe FX for body vanishing?)\nUNCLE: WINKY Give me that, you monster! Give it to me!\nRASSILON: Gladly.\nUNCLE: WINKY (Disbelieving) \"Through and through... the vorpal blade went snicker-snack?'\nTEPES: (Calmly) I cannot resist you, Rassilon. I never could.\nRASSILON: Then do not try.\nTEPES: Remember, Doctor... where there's life, there's — (dies)\nDOCTOR: (Agonised) Please... no more...\nRASSILON: Off your knees, creature! Who are you?\nRASSILON: DOCTOR The Doctor.\nRASSILON: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: (Weakly) Zagreus.\nRASSILON: laughs maniacally.\nLEELA: (Gasping) I may still rip out your heart with my other arm...\nBRIGADIER: My heart? Haven't got one, savage. Now bleed to death quietly. (Aloud) Miss Pollard — if you had the sense you were born with, you'd have seized the chance to run.\nCHARLEY: It's called loyalty.\nBRIGADIER: What, to a wounded animal? I always thought it strange, how when the K9 robot was around, this Leela thing was more the Doctor's pet.\nROMANA: My word — the worm has turned, hasn't it, TARDIS?\nBRIGADIER: _ Breaking cover too, Madam President? I expected better of you! Still, if you girls must rush to your deaths — close your eyes before my bullets pass between them!\nROMANA: Rushing to my doom? You should know me better than that.\nBRIGADIER: What — you hope to overcome me?\nROMANA: Nothing so exhausting. I just wanted to get close enough to use — this!\nCHARLEY: What is that?\nROMANA: Transduction buffer. Hasn't been used for years. I wondered if it might be useful, that's why I brought it with me. Now let' see — ah, yes...\nROMANA: Can't transport it too far. How about — above the crucible?’\nCHARLEY: Excellent idea!\nCHARLEY: close by.\nBRIGADIER: Let me go, Romana! I am no one's toy! [am my own TARDIS!\nROMANA: (Aloud) Let's see you defy gravity, then.\nBRIGADIER: _ (Falling into crucible) Nooooooo00000000000000000!\nBRIGADIER: normal.\nCHARLEY: What a horrible way to die.\nROMANA: It was a machine. It didn't feel anything.\nCHARLEY: I think it did. That was the problem. (Beat) Look after Leela. I'm going after the Doctor. (Exits)\nROMANA: Charley!\nLEELA: (Gasping to ROMANA) The wound is mortal. Tell the Doctor I died bravely.\nROMANA: Stuff and nonsense — the bullet winged you, that's all.\nLEELA: You are sure?\nROMANA: Quite sure.\nLEELA: (Perky) Then why are we wasting time? (Fading into distance as they leave...) Tell\nLEELA: the Doctor about this and I shall burst your eyeballs with my thumbs.\nROMANA: (Mocking) Not a word, ‘brave hunter’. Not a word...\nROMANA: TARDIS, in fact — rises out of metal. Music: 'Up' music sting here, perhaps?\nCHARLEY: (Running into room) Doctor? Doctor? Doctor where are you— (Beat; sees him, excited) Doctor! Oh, Doctor, I never thought I'd see you again...\nDOCTOR: (Evil Zagreus voice) I never thought you'd want to, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: (Small) Oh, no. Not you. Not again.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Did you miss me? Did your little human heart ache every moment I\nDOCTOR: was gone? Did you have bad thoughts about me, in the small dark hours before the dawn? Give in to them, Charlotte. Give in to me. You know you want to!\nCHARLEY: Get back, you — you monster!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Monster, am I? Monster? I'm what the monsters have nightmares about! (Normal voice) Help me, Charley.\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice) I can't control it, not any more. Each time it bursts over me, it's like I'm drowning. Going under for the last time.\nCHARLEY: What do you want me to do?\nDOCTOR: (Normal. Struggling) I want you to — want you to...\nRASSILON: I do believe he wants you to kill him, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: (To DOCTOR) Kill you...? No!\nRASSILON: Dear Zagreus here has agreed to be my state executioner my Witchfinder General. I can just see it: 'Are you now, or have you ever been, a Divergent?’ (Beat; slightly bored) Take the blade, Miss Pollard. Go on. You two have played out this farce before, I believe?\nDOCTOR: (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: I can't.\nDOCTOR: (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: I love you.\nDOCTOR: (Normal) Kill me. You wouldn't ask me — unless... (Normal) Kill me. Unless you didn't love me back. (Normal) Kill me.\nDOCTOR: ears. ROMANA and LEELA rush in. DOCTOR and CHARLEY continue rhythm of their dialogue, oblivious to all interruption.\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nCHARLEY: Charley?\nCHARLEY: In the time station, you said you did. (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: What's going on?\nCHARLEY: Madam President! Enjoy the entertainment. It'll all be over soon. You didn't mean it, did you?\nCHARLEY: (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: Do not listen to him!\nCHARLEY: She won't.\nCHARLEY: Just the sort of thing the Doctor says. (Normal — it's becoming a mantra) Kill me. She wouldn't...\nCHARLEY: I thought you were the bravest person I ever knew. (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: Put the knife down, girl!\nCHARLEY: Thing is, you're not.\nCHARLEY: (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: Put it down!!!\nCHARLEY: It's me. I'm the bravest person here. (Normal) Kill me.\nCHARLEY: No, Charley!\nCHARLEY: Charley — no!\nCHARLEY: No! No!!!\nCHARLEY: Goodbye, Doctor.\nCHARLEY: (Normal) Goodbye, Charley. Thank you. (Blazing with anger) What have you done, girl? What have you done?!\nCHARLEY: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Really I am. (Weeps)\nCHARLEY: 74, INT. THE DOCTOR'S HEAD.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR\nFIFTH: DOCTOR\nSIXTH: DOCTOR\nSIXTH: (Slow clapping) Bravo! Bravo, my friend! Very good. Not bad, I suppose. A little overwrought, perhaps? But it's a better exit than I\nSIXTH: ever had. A bang on the head, I ask you...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR _ Even that's more dignified than what I endured. Didn't see that one coming,\nSEVENTH: did I?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Where am I? Oh! Oh, I see. That was it, then?\nSIXTH: DOCTOR _ That's your lot, mate. The final curtain. Cry 'Author! Author!’ all you want — no\nSIXTH: one's coming back on stage.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR House lights up. Exit audience. The end.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~~ And I very much fear, the moment's not been prepared for...\nSIXTH: DOCTOR ~~ Whatever will the critics say? Melodramatic...\nFIFTH: DOCTOR _.... overlong...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR _....derivative, too. Still, the leading lady saved the show.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR __ Didn't she just! Don't think any of mine would have done the same...\nFIFTH: DOCTOR What, not even Peri?\nSIXTH: DOCTOR —_(Vaguely agreeing) Mm...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Not even Mel?\nSIXTH: DOCTOR Oh, she tried it with carrot juice. Nearly succeeded, too.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR So, what happens now?\nFIFTH: DOCTOR Oh, you'll regenerate. You'll see this blaze of light. A comet across the medulla oblongata...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR A newstar!\nSIXTH: DOCTOR = Any second now...\nSIXTH: Beat.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~~ Won't bea moment.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR _ Extraordinary, it is, when the miracle begins again.\nSIXTH: Beat.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Is it me, or is it getting darker?\nFIFTH: DOCTOR — Now you come to mention it...\nSIXTH: DOCTOR Oh, dear. You've done it now, haven't you? Done it good and proper.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Well, it was bound to happen eventually.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR No! No, it's not my time! I've got too much left to do!\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR That's what I said.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR __ [never got to Blackpool.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR __ [never saw England win the Ashes.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR _ Getting very dark now, isn't it?\nFIFTH: DOCTOR Interesting.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR Your Charley doesn't do things by halves, does she?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR No, it was me. Me! I think, what with the anti-time, and Charley hating me so very much, I think — I think I might have wanted this.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~~ _—~ Wanted it...?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Just for a second or two.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR That would have been enough.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR You gave in. You gave up. And whatever we do\nSIXTH: FIFTH/SIXTH/SEVENTH DOCTORS (Together) We never, ever, never give up!\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Youre fading!\nFIFTH: DOCTOR — Goodbye, old chap.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR A bientot.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Farewell.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR No! Don't go! I don't want to be alone! (Beat) I'm not Alone. That's it — I'm not alone! You three! Wait!\nSIXTH: DOCTOR _ Bit late to rediscover your lust for life, isn't it?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR No. No, it's not. Listen: when I needed you before, when Zagreus's shade first fell over me...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Oh, very poetic.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR ...you weren't there! None of you! So what's changed now? (Beat) The blade! The blade! Well, don't you see? Rassilon cut you down, all three! And when Charley plunged the blade between my hearts — you came back to me! So the blade must have done it — must have sucked the missing bits of me out of Townsend, Tepes, Winkel. That's how I got you back!\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR I This changes nothing.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR It changes everything! I can think again! I want to live!\nFIFTH: DOCTOR But the moment's passed. You haven't regenerated. You, me, all of us. Finally, actually dead.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Not necessarily!\nSIXTH: DOCTOR _ The message was never sent! The magic never happened! You've no replacement!\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR (Grim) Oh yes I have.\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Are we thinking what we're thinking?\nFIFTH: DOCTOR’ Weare.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR = Zagreus?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Zagreus isn't a person. He's not even real! Zagreus is a power — the power to cancel out time itself. If I use that power...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR By using the power, you become Zagreus.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR _ Cogito ergo sum. I think, therefore... and so on.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR _ But Zagreus is the danger!\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Anti-time is the danger, but Zagreus is not its servant — Zagreus is its master. The power is mine — but the blade is Rassilon's. I have to stop him using it. I have to go back. I have to become Zagreus.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR ~ What, forever and ever?\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Do you know what that means?\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Ido. (Beat) So, um...\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~ Weshould try joining hands, or something symbolic.\nEIGHTH: DOCTOR Good idea! (Beat) Ready?\nFIFTH: DOCTOR Ready. (Beat) I am Zagreus!\nSIXTH: DOCTOR — [am Zagreus!\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR [am Zagreus!\nSEVENTH: Continue into:\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) 1 AM ZAGREUS!\nCHARLEY: jumps, squeals.\nCHARLEY: LEELA The Doctor lives?\nROMANA: Oh, no, he doesn't.\nRASSILON: My friend. Are you ready to begin?\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Begin what, Rassilon?\nRASSILON: Why, the great task for which you were created! The extermination of the Divergence!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Why? Why should I do this?\nRASSILON: Because they are not like us! Because they will under everything I have worked to create: my Eye of Harmony, my Gallifrey, my universe. The continuity I have built.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) That things shall never flux nor wither nor change their state? Is that it?\nRASSILON: Yes! Change! Hated change! This Divergence is an upstart reality. Would you let it all die? This great civilisation? The worlds beyond? The planet Earth? Oh, but how you love the planet Earth! Would you watch it boil and die, ravaged by the uncaring hand of this other species?\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice. Slowly) Earth?\nRASSILON: Earth! Oh, I have seen the Earth, seen it through the Doctor's travels. The library at Alexandria. The Red Fort at Delhi. The canals of Venice. The Golden Gate Bridge.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) I... 1...\nROMANA: Don't listen to him, Zagreus! Alexandria burned. The Red Fort was sacked. Venice sank beneath the waves. And we all know what happened to San Francisco. That's history. That's life. That's how it goes. The time line is not yours to write!\nRASSILON: Your duty is to your world, your reality!\nROMANA: No! Our duty is to the inevitability of events. Sometimes, the hardest thing is not to act. To watch the things you love wither and waste and die. But if history decrees that our time is up; if evolution demands we are made extinct — then so be it. You can fight the future all right, and may the best reality win — but you can't fix the competition!\nRASSILON: See? See? My children cannot be trusted with their inheritance. The time line needs taking in hand. Zagreus, I have given these powers to you. Use them boldly. Get a grip on history. Take control. Better you than a power-crazed villain out for personal gain.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Yes... yes, Isee. You're right.\nDOCTOR: RASSILON The best candidate is the man who least wants the job. My friend, that's you. Take the blade. Feel its power. It's yours. All yours! Feel Venice rise above the waves. Know that the wisdom of Alexandria is yours to access. Know what it means to be God.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) God? God, you say? Yes — yes, maybe I am. I can unmake disaster. I can ensure no one dies young. I can heal the sick with the slightest touch. I am! I am God!\nRASSILON: Yes!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) I am Zagreus!\nRASSILON: Yes!!!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) I am — (normal voice) your puppet. Yank my strings, why don't you?\nRASSILON: Eh? No, no — that's not how it is!\nDOCTOR: That's exactly how it is! But I won't be anybody's dummy — (Zagreus voice) — and I\nDOCTOR: will not dance for an old dead fool who won't accept his time is up!\nRASSILON: No! No! Leave me be! I command you!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Come with me!\nCHARLEY: (To ROMANA) We've got to help him! ROMANA The die is cast. There's nothing more we can do.\nCHARLEY: What do you mean? We can't just—\nROMANA: Leela, hold her back!\nCHARLEY: Ow! Get off!\nLEELA: This is the Doctor's fight now.\nCHARLEY: Doctor!!!\nCHARLEY: behind.\nRASSILON: Where are you taking me? L-let me go!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Can't you guess — my Lord?\nRASSILON: No! Not there! Anywhere but there!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) We're having a party, Rassilon. And guess who I've invited? Can\nDOCTOR: you hear them, knocking on the door? Shall I open it, and let them in?\nRASSILON: (Angry) You fool! You can't open the vault — no one can, not even I!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) But I have the knife! Mine is the power! IAM ZAGREUS!\nRASSILON: You would not dare!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Wouldn't I? (Beat. Then in normal voice) Wouldn't I? Beat.\nDOCTOR: (Huge Zagreus voice) Yes... I... would!\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice) They're here.\nRASSILON: (Hysterical) Please! I beg you!\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice) They've come for you, my Lord.\nRASSILON: Do not do this!\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Join them in their Divergent universe.\nDOCTOR: shoves RASSILON into Divergent universe.\nRASSILON: No! No! Noooo000000000000000000000000000000000000. ..\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice. To the Divergence) No. This is not your moment. Back. Back! (Zagreus voice) Back, I say!\nDOCTOR: running down corridor, followed by ROMANA and LEELA.\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Doctor, is it safe now? Is it over?\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice) Oh, no, Charley. It'll never be... never be... (Faints)\nCHARLEY: Oh, he's fainted! Oh, come on, you two — help me!\nLEELA: We cannot.\nROMANA: He's gone, Charley.\nCHARLEY: Gone? But he can't! He's the Doctor, he doesn't do that! He doesn't just — just...\nLEELA: See his face. The life has gone out of it. (Beat) There is only —\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Zagreus.\nCHARLEY: screams. FX: TARDIS materialisation sound begins.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Scared, Miss Pollard? Scared of little old me? What's to be scared of,\nDOCTOR: hey? (Sing-song) 'Zagreus lives among the dead/Zagreus sees you in your bed/And eats you when you're sleeping!’\nCHARLEY: Behind you...\nBRIGADIER: = (Coughs) Ahem.\nDOCTOR: ( Zagreus voice) Oh, what now? I haven't even ravaged the cosmos yet—\nBRIGADIER: Hold him down! Come on, I[ haven't got all day!\nCHARLEY: We saw you die!\nBRIGADIER: = (Struggling to hold down DOCTOR) You saw me fall into the crucible, yes. Brought the bits of me back together again that did Reconstituted myself — and, well, here I am. And now if I can just absorb the vorpal blade (FX as it fizzes away) I am now complete and free of the Zagreus energies.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Kill you all! Kill! Maim! Rupture! (Muffled by BRIGADIER's hand)\nBRIGADIER: — Unlike him. Do be quiet, there's a good chap. Miss Pollard — there’s a vial m my left- hand jacket pocket...\nCHARLEY: (Rummaging) Erm... yes! With a label: 'Drink me\"?\nBRIGADIER: _ That's the one. Leela — hold his nose. Miss Pollard?\nCHARLEY: Oh, right!\nDOCTOR: splutters as he's fed liquid.\nDOCTOR: (Zagreus voice) Kill! Murder! Mmf! (Muffled again)\nBRIGADIER: That should do the trick.\nCHARLEY: What's in it?\nBRIGADIER: Look again.\nCHARLEY: It's turning into... a book? The Alice Compendium by Lewis Carroll? Contains Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass?\nBRIGADIER: Look again, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: What is it? A fizzy blob of what?\nBRIGADIER: — Curiouser and curiouser, hmm?\nROMANA: (In realisation) It's zero matter!\nBRIGADIER: _ Indeed, Madam President. It's a sliver from the glowing ball of zero matter from the heart of the TARDIS. My heart. Been trying to feed him this all day. Helped calm the Zagreus chaos in his head.\nCHARLEY: Why Alice?\nBRIGADIER: Ah. Zero matter concentrates the mind, you see. So it took the form of the biggest load of piffle it could find in the TARDIS library\nCHARLEY: Alice?\nBRIGADIER: _ Threw up all kinds of gibberish at him. The bit of his brain infected by anti-time didn't like that at all of course — so as soon as the bit of me infected by anti-time worked that out, it ejected it.\nCHARLEY: Into the Death Zone! The Jabberwock!\nROMANA: That has to be the biggest load of rubbish I've heard in all my lives. BRIGADIER/CHARLEY (Together) Exactly!\nLEELA: I do not see what's surprising. You all talk nonsense all the time.\nDOCTOR: (Normal voice. Struggling free of BRIGADIER's muffled hand) Mmf! Absolute balderdash, Leela. And you wouldn't have it any other way. (Smacks lips) Mmm, that hit the spot. Got any more?\nCHARLEY: (Entering TARDIS) Oh. Oh, Doctor, she's—\nDOCTOR: Good as new! It's like the light's been let back into the old place, isn't it? CHARLEY And the Brigadier — or whatever he, it, was?\nDOCTOR: Ah, the ghost in the machine. He's around. Won't popping up quite like before, of course. Some people used to think they’d seen a grey lady in the engine rooms. I wonder...? Awkward pause.\nCHARLEY: So.\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nCHARLEY: Say it.\nDOCTOR: Say what?\nCHARLEY: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You saved me, Charley. When I thought there was no one else, you stayed true.\nCHARLEY: I've always been true to you. (Beat) Doctor, everything we've said to each other — in the time station, in the Foundry — well, it'll take time, won't it, to work it all out? So let's just do it.\nDOCTOR: Do it...?\nCHARLEY: Go!\nDOCTOR: Oh!\nCHARLEY: Close the doors, pull the levers — go. Off on another amazing adventure. (Coy) It might be the best one we've ever had.\nDOCTOR: (Weakly) Go?\nCHARLEY: Go!\nDOCTOR: (Dark) Charley, there's nowhere left for us to go.\nCHARLEY: Don't talk silly! There's Florana for a start. And Cassiopeia — you're always banging on about Cassiopeia! Oh, and then there's the Jovian Fold... Lemuria... the Hanging Gardens of Babylon... Blackpool Pleasure Beach...\nDOCTOR: I mean, there's nowhere left for us. (Beat) Charley? Charley? Say something!\nCHARLEY: Are you dumping me?\nDOCTOR: (Floundering) I'm saying — I'm saying that the places we've been and the people\nDOCTOR: we've seen... well, we'll always have those memories, won't we?\nCHARLEY: You are! You're dumping me!\nDOCTOR: Charley, Charley, Charley — I don't want this, I don't want to be apart from you. We've grown so much since we met, both of us. You've made me smile more than — more than...\nCHARLEY: (Royally pissed off) Oh, don't tell me — Max Miller, is it? Little Tich? Big Chief Sitting Bull? (Spit out 'bull')\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, not him. Geronimo was the funny one—\nCHARLEY: SHUT... UP! (Mocking him) 'Geronimo was the funny one.' 'Ooh my dear Tsarina — care to wink my tiddles?' 'There's nowhere left for us to go, Charley.’ 'It's not you, it's me, Charley.' 'It's ME -— Charley.' (Beat) You're not the man I met. You're not the man I — (Beat) Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I've changed. It's still inside me, you know.\nCHARLEY: Zagreus, is it? Is that your excuse?\nDOCTOR: (Getting angry) Excuse...? The most destructive power in the whole of creation, and\nDOCTOR: you think it's an excuse? (Calmer) I have to leave all oft is, Charley. I don’t belong in your universe — not any more. Everything I’ve ever loved, I will destroy. And that includes you.\nCHARLEY: You're destroying me now!\nDOCTOR: I can't stay here. I'm going into the Divergent universe — to make peace with them, if I can. Your place is in this reality.\nCHARLEY: I don't have a place here. I should have died, remember?\nDOCTOR: Romana will find you one. I can't trust myself around you, don't you see? I can't trust Zagreus.\nCHARLEY: That's why you need me.\nDOCTOR: It's why you have to go\nCHARLEY: I'm not going. I'm not!\nDOCTOR: (Ferocious) For pity's sake, girl — go! (Beat) Charley. Charley, I didn't mean it like that. It's the anti-time — don't you understand? There's no cure for it—\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY And there's no cure for a broken heart. (Beat) Doors.\nDOCTOR: (Calling after her) Charley! Charley! Not like this. Not after everything we've been through. Please. Please! (FX: Echo on last ‘please’. Deep sigh, sotto) Good luck, Edwardian Adventuress. Be brilliant. I know you will.\nDOCTOR: Long pause.\nROMANA: (Entering TARDIS) Cruel to be kind — was that it? Oh, Doctor — you've still got no idea.\nDOCTOR: What do you want?\nROMANA: You're the same, you and her. Both of you carrying a plague of sorts; both of you alive after death. Perhaps you should take her with you.\nDOCTOR: Why? More convenient for you, I suppose? Still don't want to break Rassilon's rules? Charley's paradox was resolved. You can put her back at Cardington, watch her pretend to miss the flight. And then — why, the world's her oyster. Lucky thing.\nROMANA: If that's what you want.\nDOCTOR: It's my choice. My last request in this universe.\nROMANA: You've decided, then?\nDOCTOR: Don't say you doubted me?\nROMANA: I knew you'd do the right thing.\nDOCTOR: (Scathing) Good old Doctor. Good fellow. Good man. Yes I'll do the right thing. No need to call out the heavy mob.\nROMANA: If you should ever try to return—\nDOCTOR: I won't.\nROMANA: If you should ever try to r—\nDOCTOR: I will not! Why would I want to return here when are all heroes are so damned\nDOCTOR: disappointing? Omega — a madman sold out by his peers. Morbius — Time Lord of the First Rank, betrays his heritage. Borusa — my old friend, teacher and mentor — all he wants is immortality. And Rassilon — oh, Rassilon: the father of our whole society, a bigoted despot so consumed by love for his own self-image that he sentences the future to death. Who's next? You, Madam President? Is that what a. sniff of power on your pathetic planet does? Enjoy your corruption, Romana. I don’t want to see or hear anything of Gallifrey ever again.\nROMANA: You're too harsh, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, am I? Once, the Time Lords exiled me. Now, I exile myself!\nLEELA: You are crying, Charlotte Pollard.\nCHARLEY: I am not.\nLEELA: Not on the outside. In my tribe, a witch-woman grieves behalf of us all. Better that\nLEELA: than for an enemy to witness a warrior's of us tears.\nCHARLEY: I'm not crying, all right?\nLEELA: Then let me cry for you.\nCHARLEY: No. It's just — him.\nCHARLEY: LEELA The Doctor? He never changes. He listens, but he does not hear.\nCHARLEY: There's so much sadness in him now. I could take it away from him, I know I could. Sometimes, it's like he doesn't need to feel. But not feeling's like not eating. And I won't have him waste away.\nLEELA: Sadness is a strange enemy: sometimes you may conquer it, sometimes sadness\nLEELA: conquers you. (Beat) He is going now?\nCHARLEY: Yes.\nLEELA: Then you must choose.\nLEELA: CHARLEY The choosing is easy. It's the leaving that's hard.\nROMANA: This is it, then. If you go in, that's it. No favourite places like Earth. No Daleks or Cybermen. Nothing you've ever known before and you'll never, ever be able to come out.\nDOCTOR: Because in that universe, the Zagreus energy is subdued, submerged.\nROMANA: You even try to get back into our universe — if it's even possible — and time will be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: You found a way back from your pocket universe.\nROMANA: That's different. I wasn't carrying with me the means to erase past, present and future. You know, if you try, we'll stop you.\nDOCTOR: I know. No going back. Still, a universe free of the Time Lords — there's a novelty. No stupid rules, no daft regulations...\nROMANA: No time travel, either. You used to say a Time Lord's purpose was to travel in time. It'll be like losing one of your senses, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No sense, no feeling — isn't that how it goes?\nROMANA: We'll miss you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You'll get by.\nROMANA: It's a new universe, a young universe, and I want you to watch over it for me. Until —\nDOCTOR: (Sharply) Until forever. (Beat) Give Leela my best. And give Charley a chance. Goodbye, Romana.\nROMANA: Goodbye, Doctor. I wish —\nDOCTOR: So do I.\nDOCTOR: impression he's gone from our dimension. Beat.\nLEELA: That's it? He has gone now?\nROMANA: He's gone. And I don't know how we will ever cope without him.\nLEELA: Everywhere you go, they tell tales of the Doctor. There are galaxies far away from\nLEELA: here where children sleep more soundly knowing he's out there fighting off the demons. And the demons twist and turn in fear, knowing that their enemy awaits. So long as the stories are told, he's never really gone.\nROMANA: Well, we'll see. Now then — (Beat) Er, have you seen Miss Pollard?\nLEELA: She made her choice. Did you ever find the back door to the TARDIS?\nROMANA: Back door...? No, I don't think I did.\nLEELA: So do you still think I am stupid?\nROMANA: Leela, after today — I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. Don't you?\nDOCTOR: (To TARDIS) That's it, then. Just you and me now. You and me on our way to our greatest adventure. (Beat) I know you feel strange, like a fish out of water — but that will change, I promise. And who knows the places we'll see? What people we'll meet? You and me like it always was. Like it always will be. (Beat) Funny, isn't it? This big old ship of ours? Full of memory... (FX: Take Pertwee's line, 'Parts of your memory altered’, echo slightly under dialogue) full of ghosts... FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH DOCTORs all say 'Ghosts'. Echo slightly, then:\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~~ Weshould congratulate him. He did rather well.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR __ [suppose so, but it's not how I'd have done it...\nSEVENTH: DOCTOR Oh, nothing any of us ever do is quite good enough for you is it? (Beat) Goodbye, Doctor.\nSIXTH: DOCTOR __ Yes, good luck.\nFIFTH: DOCTOR ~— And well done. Top of the class and all that...\nFIFTH: Fade away over the last two lines. Beat.\nDOCTOR: Now then. Let's put Mr. Carroll back on the shelf, shall we? Hmm... Camus, Capek, Capote... The I-Spy Book of British Birds? But these shelves aren't ordered at all! You Only Live Twice, Can You Forgive Her, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.... Ah! This old thing again! (FX: Flicking through book) Yes, same preface. When was it I last picked you up? And wasn't I interrupted? (Beat) Can't remember. Anyway — (Clears throat, reads) 'In the summer of 1816 we visited Switzerland and became the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent pleasant hours on the lake or wandering on its shores — but it proved a wet, ungenial summer and incessant rain confined us for days to the house. (FX: Fade out as the DOCTOR walks away, still reading) Some volumes of ghost stories fell into our hands. \"We will each write a ghost story,\" said Byron...\nCHARLEY: (To TARDIS, over DOCTOR walking away) Sh! Don't tell him, TARDIS. Not yet. Me? I... left something behind, that's all. Does it matter? All that does matter is — well, it's just you and me now. You, me and him. Until always... (Beat; very close) Until forever.\nCHARLEY: End music.\nZAGREUS: OUTLINE By Gary Russell\nZAGREUS: At the end of Neverland, the Zagreus anti-time curse/virus/deux ex machina has transferred from Charley (who is now safe and well) to the Eighth Doctor. When we last saw our intrepid heroes, Charley was facing the raging, screaming monster that is Zagreus, living within the Doctor's body.\nZAGREUS: Ooob, scary...\nZAGREUS: So the basic plot of Zagreus, our 50th release, and the sbow’s 40th anniversary adventure (November 2003 - nice the way that’s worked out, yes?) is this:\nZAGREUS: We have to rid the Doctor of Zagreus, without it going back to Charley and starting everything all over again. If we work on the principle that it is a virus in effect, then like most viruses, you don't always get shot of it but it can go into remission: always there, bubbling inside you but if you have enough antibodies, you can usually hold it back. Which is how we leave it at the end. But I’m jumping the gun here...\nZAGREUS: What the story will do is put Charley in the position of going through the TARDIS, trying to help ‘put the Doctor back together again’ while being pursued by him as he drops in and out of his Zagreus ‘possession’. Sometimes he'll be clear and lucid, sometimes a raving monster.And sometimes, he'll appear to be clear and lucid when in fact he’s a raving monster pretending to be clear and lucid. Ah, ha. D’you see?\nZAGREUS: The TARDIS, always eager to help, does the best she can, by presenting friends to Charley. But because the TARDIS herself is infected by means of her link with the Doctor, the help is limited and rather than being able to recreate pure copies of past Doctors (and companions), they're more like shades of themselves. Anti-time versions; versions that might have been, but afl living in a situation that would be familiar to Charley (all the parallels we draw are based on locations/periods between 1910 and 1930).\nZAGREUS: She’s aided by the one thing the TARDIS can do, that is create a three-dimensional hologram (based on the technology we see in the TARDIS Console Room ceiling) that Charley can interact with. It takes on the form of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who plays White Rabbit to Charley's Alice, often appearing and disappearing at inopportune moments depending on what is going on with the Eighth Doctor/Zagreus. ‘It’ doesn’t necessarily know it’s the Brigadier any more than our other phantoms know who they are, but she'll call him Brigadier. Why does the TARDIS use that body? The Brigadier is the\nZAGREUS: only other past friend of the Doctor's that Charley has met. Bar Romana. But there’s a reason why it's not her...\nACTONE: This features the set-up as we learn what Zagreus is, what Chartey must do, and introduces our Brigadier/Rabbit character. Charley takes her first tentative steps through the dreamscapes that the TARDIS conjures up - including a sequence set in the alternate Gallifrey (the TARDIS’s most recent stop-off) with Imperiatrix Romana conquering the universe. We might also do a Zagreus-based one, maybe a First World War trenches scenario to establish the fact that the dreamscapes have to be based on Charley's period perceptions. This will be an opportunity for us to give a handful of small roles to our\nACTONE: 404\nACTONE: other regular actors such as Steve Feweil, Mark Gatiss, Toby Longworth, Robert Jezek, Janie Goddard, Nick Pegg, Barney Edwards, et cetera.\nACTONE: I have negotiated with the Brighton guys [Ashley Nealfuller, David Clarke and Stephen Cranford, who had worked with Jon Pertwee on an unfinished amateur video] to get the Pertwee dialogue we talked about, so if we can square it with Ingeborg (Pertwee, Jon’s widow], this is where the McGann/Pertwee confrontation will occur.\nACTONE: The episode will end with Charley and the Brigadier stumbling up against their first ‘Doctor’ dreamscape. ..\nACTONE: AcT Two\nACTONE: it’s the Seventh Doctor, a mad inventor and creator of strange devices. Twitchy, nervous and slightly doolally, it’s a parallel with Einstein/Oppenheimer - this Doctor is building a deadly weapon that will destroy whatever world he inhabits, although he, of course, can’t see this. It’s all science to him. He'll be ‘assisted’ by Sophie Aldred, Lisa Bowerman and Bonnie Langford.\nACTONE: At the end of the episode, Bonnie’s character will lead Charley and the Brigadier through to the next dreamscape where she is alongside...\nACT: THREE\nACT: The Sixth Doctor as a kind of Citizen Kane despot, dark and powerful, ruling his empire with a rod of iron. Apart from Bonnie, this scenario will also feature Maggie Stables and Nicola Bryant.\nACT: Thus it is Nicola who will take Charley and the Brigadier into...\nACT: FOUR\nACT: Where we meet the Fifth Doctor, the driver of a train, aware that he’s going to cause an accident that will kill his passengers. These, of course, include Nicola, as well as Sarah Sutton, Caroline Morris and Mark Strickson.\nACT: At the end of this, Charley will have sufficiently altered the characters of the three Doctors, who in each ‘scape will wink out of existence. However, this escape will end on a cliffhanger where Charley is going to die at the hands of Zagreus che'll have cropped up briefly in the other scenarios, too)...\nACT: FIVE\nACT: ...and the only way to save her is to get extra help. The Brigadier/TARDIS/rabbit will sacrifice itself to give Charley enough power to contact Romana and beg for help, filling her in on the situation, and she'll have the TARDIS remotely brought to the one safe place on Gailifrey, the Matrix, where the dreamscapes will subside.\nACT: Romana will enter the TARDIS and now join forces with Charley in trying to solve the problems.\nACT: The Act will end with Romana drawing forth the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, the\nTARDIS: now having the power to create them as they really are - still phantoms but drawn from her memories.They act as, and indeed think they are, the real things. But will Zagreus arrive and muck it all up?\nTARDIS: 405\nACT: SIX\nACT: Romana, Charley and the Sixth Doctor help the Eighth Doctor, who is himself whilst inside the Matrix, while the Fifth and Seventh Doctors set out to find out a way of controlling the virus permanently. In the Matrix they will encounter Rassilon, who offers them a solution - the Doctor can stay inside the Matrix forever, enabling him to leave and live again. This seems like a good deal until they realise they are being hoodwinked - Rassilon (or maybe Zagreus infecting Rassilon, we'll never be too sure...) is willing to sacrifice the Doctor for his own ends.\nACT: The Sixth Doctor and Romana have come up with a better alternative - using the technology they faced when the Daleks invaded Gallifrey, they can create a whole new universe for the Doctor, free of everything from this universe. This is the remission ~ he carries the Zagreus virus forever inside him but in this new universe, with no links to Gallifrey (and thus Earth, Daleks, Cybermen, et cetera) he can live a full and normal life. Oh, and as the question is asked (and for a brief moment, our listeners will think that’s what we're up to) regenerating into a Ninth Doctor won't stop the virus -~ being anti- time, it’s too powerful.\nACT: Thus the Doctor heads off into his new universe, never able to return, and asks Charley to come with him. But that'll be it - she can never, ever go home again. There's a new universe out there, full of the unknown, with just the two of them as the only familiar things... will she go?\nACT: Of course she will.\nTARDIS: demats, phantoms vanish, and Romana says bye bye forever.\nTARDIS: Diddly dum, diddly dum, diddty dum, wooo ooo...\nTARDIS: By going into the new universe be bas, of course, lost access to the vortex - thus whilst the TARDIS can still go from A to B, from where to where, it can no longer time travel, or go from when to when. Whilst, in a new universe, this may not seem too bad, it will affect the Doctor quite badly that something be could do, be now can’t. And maybe it will be necessary in one story of the following season that be wants to go back a few moments/bours/whatever (after all, no Time Lords, no Laws of Time) and can't.\nTARDIS: Id also like to consider the possibility that something in this new universe isn't right, maybe a few physics laws are slightly altered, and perbaps the TARDIS begins to bave a personality of its own. A strange figure the Doctor and Charley might see from the corner of their eye now and again, shadowing them. Maybe that starts in Story 1 and is explained but not concluded in Story 3.\nTARDIS: 406"
