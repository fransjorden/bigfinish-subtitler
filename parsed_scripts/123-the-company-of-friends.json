I’m an archaeology professor, although I gave up my chair to go freelance when... no, let's not get into that here. Let’s see - I travelled with the Doctor for a very long time... I think he was in his seventh body then. I met him on the planet Heaven and fought the Hoothi, a race of monsters who looked like giant .. um .. mushrooms. We had dozens of adventures. Went all across time and space.\nBENNY: Anyway, to cut a long story short, I left the Doctor and eventually he regenerated into a rather dashing chap with long hair. I only met that Doctor a few times. The first was in 1997. Blimey, was it really that long ago? Anyway - big spaceships over London, the Ice Warriors invaded - oh, I’m an expert on Martian history, by the way. That’s my speciality - and we defeated them. I say we, but it was mainly the Doctor, as ever.\nBENNY: At the end of that, he dropped me off back in my native timezone and we, er, shook hands and said goodbye. Since then, I’ve kept myself busy. I worked at the Braxiatel Collection. I was there during that business with the Fifth Axis. I have a son, now. Loads of adventures of my own. What, you think our lives just stop and start depending on whether the Doctor's around?\nBENNY: Anyway. The second time I met this ‘new’ Doctor was on the planet Epsilon Minima. I was in the middle of an archaeological excavation in a coal mine, which wasn’t exactly going very smoothly...\nBENNY: [fade to scene one]\nBENNY: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 2\nBENNY: SCENE 1. EPSILON MINIMA. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER\nBENNY: AROUND. DRILLING MACHINES BASHING AND CRACKING GREAT COALFACES. COAL SHOWERING DOWN AND PULLED AWAY ON CONVEYOR BELTS. THIS CONTINUES UNTIL WE ESTABLISH IT, THEN OVER THE\nDIN: WE HEAR A SHOUTED -\nBERNICE: OK ... Shut down, shut down.\nKLARNER: There’s nothing wrong is there, Professor Summerfield?\nBERNICE: We’ve got enough for another survey. Give that fresh rock face a go with that gadget of yours, Klarner.\nKLARNER: Still only a faint reading.\nBERNICE: No change at all?\nKLARNER: I can’t see anything.\nBERNICE: Archaeology is usually more subtle than laser drills and mining droids. This is more like quarrying. And it would help if I knew exactly what we’re looking for.\nKLARNER: Er.. Venhella will want to know why we’ve stopped.\nBENNY: That’1l be Venhella and the vast sum of money she’s paying me. Just reminding myself why I agreed to do this job blindfolded, as it were. Let’s get back to work, then. Start the drills up.\nBENNY: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 3\nUNTIL: .. ONE OF THE TWO MACHINES STARTS VIBRATING AND IS\nCLEARLY: MALFUNCTIONING\nBERNICE: Agh! Shut down, shut down!\nKLARNER: They’re out of control! The drills, they’ re—\nWHINES: DOWN, AS BEFORE. AFTER A MOMENT TO LET THE DUST SETTLE, WE HEAR KLARNER CRUNCHING HIS WAY OVER\nBERNICE: [SPLUTTERING] You OK?\nKLARNER: [TRYING TO STIFLE HIS SPLUTTERS] Of course. We... er... we lost a couple of the robots, that’s all. And you should be wearing a hard hat and work gloves, Ms Summerfield!\nBERNICE: Thank you so much, Mr Health and Safety. But I’m perfectly safe without - Woah! Rockfall!\nBERNICE: SETTLE.\nBERNICE: Interesting... what have we here? Oh, more coal. [SPOTTING SOMETHING] Wait a minute... [STARTS SIFTING THROUGH COAL. AS SHE DOES SO..] What just happened, by the way?\nKLARNER: We’ve been working these drills too hard. They’1ll need to stay shut down for a while. But it doesn’t matter. We should proceed with hand tools from now on, anyway, otherwise we run the risk of damaging something as small as - [stops himself... Er. Mm.\nBERNICE: As small as what? Klarner! You do know what Venhella’s after, don’t you? I thought as much! You said you were as much in the dark as me!\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 4\nKLARNER: [defensive] The Countess, whose terms of employment you agreed to, Ms Summerfield, made it clear that we were only to discuss immediate operational concerns with each other.\nBERNICE: I know. But there’s always a problem working out what’s vital information and what isn’t. If I had a better idea of what we were looking for, we might have found it already. Is it this, for example?\nVENHELLA: All you need to know -\nBERNICE: [startled] Countess Venhella. Please don’t sneak up on us. As you can see, this is delicate stuff.\nVENHELLA: [UNIMPRESSED] What is that?\nBERNICE: A perfectly preserved fern in the middle of the coal seam.\nVENHELLA: Please don’t get distracted. This is important work and we’re barely on schedule. Now I’m getting reports that the lift mechanism’s fused and will take hours to repair.\nBERNICE: We’re nearly a day ahead of where we planned to be by now. After five days of a dig, that’s good, believe me. There will always be glitches. You need to be patient. And perhaps if you’d allow me to examine these mysterious ‘ancient texts’ you keep mentioning—\nVENHELLA: [VERY MESSIANIC] It is forbidden knowledge.\nBERNICE: But not for you?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 5\nVENHELLA: I have devoted my life to their study. I have come to a higher level of understanding. And you agreed not to ask any questions.\nBERNICE: [REGRETTING IT] Yes... so I did.\nVENHELLA: [CAUGHT UP IN HER ‘QUEST’] This rock is fifty million years old. After so many millennia of solitude, it isn’t fair to expect the world to give up its secrets easily.\nBERNICE: Er .. yes. And all that sort of thing. I was going to say ‘it’s like looking for an unidentified needle in a very dark haystack’, but you were a lot more poetic just then. Avoided the clichés. Mostly. What are you doing?\nVENHELLA: Have either of you checked this scanner since this section was uncovered?\nKLARNER: The drills have only just shut down, we haven’t had a chance -\nVENHELLA: Incredible.\nBERNICE: Incredible?\nKLARNER: It’s .. a perfect match.\nVENHELLA: You’ve found it. Congratulations, Professor Summerfield.\nBERNICE: Found... what?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 6\nVENHELLA: Security robots, secure this chamber.\nVENHELLA: A NEARBY TUNNEL, WHIRRING ETC, MOVING FAST. ONCOMING THREAT.\nVENHELLA: Orbital unit, stand by.\nKLARNER: [AWED] We... found it?\nBENNY: Er.. may I see that scanner, please?\nBENNY: It says whatever it is is embedded in the rock wall. Somewhere over...\nBENNY: [READING SCANNER] Here .. wow. There is something here. Several somethings, in fact. And really quite small.\nVENHELLA: There, look! You can see it!\nBENNY: It? What? Oh yes... just poking out of the rock.\nVENHELLA: Take it out. You’re wearing gloves, it’s safe to.\nBERNICE: Er... hold on. We need to make measurements, take careful note of the context.\nVENHELLA: The ‘context’ is that we’ve spent a week down a mine looking for this and now we’ve found it. Take it! fThat’s\nVENHELLA: an order!\nVENHELLA: MENACINGLY.\nVENHELLA: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 7\nROBOT: Security Robots reporting. Full offensive capability engaged.\nVENHELLA: Well, ‘Benny’?\nBERNICE: Um .. OK. Just don’t tell any other archaeology professors\nBERNICE: or I’1ll have to hand in my membership badge.\nBERNICE: It’s quite loose, actually. Interesting .. a manufactured item. Actually .. are those coat buttons in there with it? Yes... fossilized buttons.\nVENHELLA: Show me the key.\nBERNICE: Key? Is that what it is? Here. It looks familiar.\nVENHELLA: You can’t have seen anything like this. It’s the key toa TARDIS.\nBERNICE: A... what?\nVENHELLA: TARDIS. You won’t have heard the word.\nBERNICE: a ae\nVENHELLA: But when I touch this key, the artron differential will be\nVENHELLA: shorted. The key will be re-energised. And whichever TARDIS it belongs to will be summoned .. and it will arrive - now:\nVENHELLA: [beat]\nBERNICE: Hmmmm .\nBERNICE: [beat]\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 8\nVENHELLA: I don’t understand.\nKLARNER: It might be because.. er..[HE’S GOT NOTHING AND JUST TAILS OFF]\nVENHELLA: Because what? [BEAT] Well shut up, then.\nVENHELLA: [beat]\nBERNICE: Well, anyway, about my fee -\nBERNICE: [beat]\nVENHELLA: Yes!\nKLARNER: That’s a TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Hello. Hey, it’s dark out here. I’m the -\nBERNICE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes, how did— ? Wait, you’re .. Benny! Bernice Summerfield. Great to see -\nBERNICE: Um, Doctor, I don’t suppose you could give me a lift away from here?\nDOCTOR: But I’ve only just— [arrived]\nBENNY: Like, now?\nBENNY: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 9\nDOCTOR: ‘Like now?’ Why, is there something - [the matter ]?\nBENNY: ‘Something the matter’? Yes, I think there’s about to be!\nVENHELLA: Security robots!\nDOCTOR: Yes, they are, aren’t they? And they don’t look very friendly.\nBENNY: Quickly, Doctor!\nVENHELLA: Don’t let them get inside the TARDIS!\nVENHELLA: PLACE.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Look, I wasn’t intending to go back in there anyway, you know.\nVENHELLA: Grab him!\nDOCTOR: ‘Grab’? I really don’t feel there’s any need for any grabbing.

What is that, an IMC mining robot?\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] Might be... whatever it is, it’s been adapted for security work. So .. what’s your plan?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Years since I’ve seen one of those. [beat] Sorry?\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] Your brilliant plan. You know who Venhella really is, and what she wants. You’re here to stop her.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Who’s Venhella? Why would I need a plan? Do I need a plan? Hmmm .. better think of one.\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] You’re the Doctor, you always arrive with a plan.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Do I?\nBENNY: [SOTTO] You always did, anyway.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Did I?\nBENNY: [SOTTO] Yes.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Oh. Well, I’1l see what I can do, then. It’s great to see you again, by the way, Benny.\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] You don’t look a day older.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Oh, you do. I mean .. you look wonderful. Been busy?\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 13\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] I think ‘yes’ just about covers that. Very long story. Oh - I have a son, now. Peter.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Wow. That’s great. Where is he?\nBERNICE: [SOTTO] He’s with his dad... it’s another long story. And how’s life treating you?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Well enough. Um, back to our immediate predicament... No sign of any more robots. I think it’s safe to get down now. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Ah, that’s better. Now... Who’s this Venhella person?\nBERNICE: Her full name’s the Countess Ninth Circle Venhella Dun Harva Eis De Sedna.\nDOCTOR: Ah .. Plutovian aristocracy.\nBERNICE: Yes.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing with an ice heiress on a jungle planet?\nBERNICE: Jungle planet? This is Epsilon Minima.\nDOCTOR: What? But... Epsilon Minima’s a frozen wilderness. I saw the scanner when the TARDIS landed. It was definitely a jungle.\nBERNICE: This isn’t a jungle.\nDOCTOR: No it’s not. Hmmm. This happened to me before, but then it was a pollen-induced illusion -\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 14\nBERNICE: A what?\nDOCTOR: . this time, I’m not so sure... We should probably compare notes. So .. the TARDIS detected something, was homing in on\nDOCTOR: it. Landed. I checked the scanner. Jungle. Stepped outside, you were there for the rest.\nBERNICE: OK. I’ve been here miles below the surface of Epsilon Minima in these coal mines for five days, looking for an alien artifact with a weird energy signature. Venhella’s people detected it when they surveyed the system. She paid me to excavate it, but didn’t tell me much about what it was. It turns out it was a TARDIS key. She already knew that exposing it would set off some sort of beacon and the\nTARDIS: would arrive. It did, and.. you were there for the rest. Any idea what Venhella wants with a Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps she’s lonely. Us Time Lords are great company, after all.\nBERNICE: Doesn’t seem very likely.\nDOCTOR: No? Did she mention me by name?\nBERNICE: [thinks] No. In fact, she said ‘whatever TARDIS it belonged\nBERNICE: ’\nBERNICE: to’, something like that.\nDOCTOR: I guess I was just unlucky, then.\nBERNICE: Here’s a thought: what if she’s not after you? There have\nBERNICE: to be a hundred things she would want to do with a TARDIS. Even if she doesn’t want to go back in time to assassinate her ex-boyfriend or whatever, there’s technology she could take. What if she’s after your ship, not you?\nDOCTOR: Good luck to her with that. It’1ll take more than a few mining robots to get past the old girl’s defences.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 15\nBERNICE: Well .. to be fair, Venhella does have the key ...\nCUT TO: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 16\nCUT TO: SCENE 3. TARDIS\nVENHELLA: Magnificent. This is the heart of the TARDIS.\nKLARNER: I read the legends, but this is ...\nVENHELLA: Central console. Time rotor. Door control.\nKLARNER: [WONDERMENT] The forces it must be able to harness.\nVENHELLA: She. This TARDIS is a ‘she’. She’s alive, you know.\nKLARNER: The Earth Empire has nothing like this. Nothing. I’m not sure about it counting as ‘alive’, though.\nVENHELLA: (very cold) I am.\nKLARNER: What I mean to say is that just from a quick look at these readouts, there are things this TARDIS is capable of that are .. they’re not within the scope of human endeavour.\nVENHELLA: The Gallifreyans are ten million years in advance of us. That long ago, the ancestors of humans hadn’t even climbed into the trees, let alone come down from them.\nKLARNER: This is incredible.\nVENHELLA: This TARDIS is alive in a way mere animals like us can never be. The Time Lord we saw won’t give her up without a fight. And it turns out that Summerfield was in league with him. How is that even possible? [beat, then a radio squawk]. Security teams, check in, please.\nVENHELLA: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 17\nVENHELLA: You said this would work in here.\nKLARNER: It should do. Try the test signal.\nKLARNER: That’s being broadcast from our control centre. So signals can get through the TARDIS shielding.\nVENHELLA: I see. Get to the control centre and find out what the problem is.\nKLARNER: Of course.\nVENHELLA: [almost a whisper] Don’t worry. Everything will soon be all\nVENHELLA: right.\nCUT TO: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 18\nCUT TO: SCENE 4. MINESHAFT\nAMBIENT: ECHORY TUNNEL, GRAVEL FLOOR\nBERNICE: Can’t hear any robots.

What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: A twinge.\nBERNICE: You get twinges?\nDOCTOR: Not often.\nBERNICE: You never used to get twinges.\nDOCTOR: Something .. weird is happening.\nDOCTOR: It feels like time is .. folding in on itself.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 19\nBERNICE: I’1ll take your word for it. And what makes that happen?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS has defence systems. Some of them even work. If Venhella is prodding around, she might have triggered something. [A SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH, AS HE HAS ANOTHER TWINGE] This feels like the early stages of a time bubble. We need to get back to the ship and stop it.\nBERNICE: OK. That wasn’t time bubbling or folding, that was an animal.\nDOCTOR: There! Don’t move! A lion. I mean, sort of. Some type of big cat. Green fur, blue mane. Fangs, obviously.\nBERNICE: That’s one of the TARDIS defences? A big green lion?\nDOCTOR: No, Benny - that’s just a lion... thing.\nBERNICE: I can never remember. With lions do you stand your ground and look fierce, or roll over and play dead?\nBERNICE: IT’S OBVIOUSLY RIGHT WITH THEM\nDOCTOR: Benny?\nBERNICE: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Shut up and run!\nCUT TO: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 20\nCUT TO: SCENE 5.

What is that?\nVENHELLA: It formed in the time rotor, it spread all across the ceiling in just a few minutes.\nKLARNER: What is it, though?\nVENHELLA: She is straining against her chains. Soon she will be free.\nKLARNER: You’ve activated the manumitter? It needs two people to operate.\nVENHELLA: One to operate, another to monitor the results. And the results are obvious.\nKLARNER: Gah!\nVENHELLA: Stay away from the console.\nKLARNER: [horrified] My hand. Look at my hand.\nVENHELLA: Rejuvenated.\nKLARNER: It’s a child’s hand .. it’s not even up to my elbow. I didn’t do anything!\nKLARNER: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 21\nVENHELLA: You should be grateful that you’ve been granted such a boon.\nKLARNER: Tecs. HOrrreiie:\nVENHELLA: It’s a gift. Try again, see if it rejuvenates the rest of you.\nKLARNER: No! Wait .. the walls are changing. Was that a - ?\nVENHELLA: Did you make contact with the guards?\nKLARNER: What? No. I couldn’t see them on any of the monitors. But there was quite heavy distortion. The lift’s still down, but there’s no-one there fixing it. The only thing that’s changed is the presence of the TARDIS.\nVENHELLA: And the Time Lord.\nKLARNER: I didn’t see any evidence of sabotage, so [beat] There was definitely a face just then.\nVENHELLA: A face?\nKLARNER: A... yes, I think so.

I told you I saw a jungle.\nBERNICE: That’s the sun. But we’re three miles underground. Well, we were just now.\nDOCTOR: Oh. This is all a bit Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, isn’t it? Except, ironically, I think we’ve just managed to evade the lion -\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 23\nDOCTOR: Look at that! Magnificent specimen when you look at him close up, isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: He got my coat!\nBERNICE: Run!\nDOCTOR: Good idea!\nBERNICE: Wait, not this way! No - !\nBENNY AND THE DOCTOR: [plummeting] Aaaaarrgggh!\nBERNICE: [splutters and ughs]\nDOCTOR: You OK?\nBERNICE: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Swim that way, to the shore. Not far.\nBERNICE: I’ve got it.\nDOCTOR: All right?\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 24\nBERNICE: I’m dripping wet. Apart from that, I’m fine.\nDOCTOR: The lion didn’t follow us down.\nBERNICE: Sensible lion. Look, I need to wring out my jumpsuit and empty out my boots.\nDOCTOR: At least it’s a warm day. Soon get everything dry in this sun. It’s washed off all that coal dust. Look - that lion\nDOCTOR: tore my coat pocket right off. I’ve lost some buttons.\nBERNICE: Do you mind if we stop here for a bit? Get my breath back? I was worried about you back there.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Top up your tan.\nBERNICE: Your clothes are already dry. They’re made of special magic space fabric, of course.\nDOCTOR: I’1l get you the address of my tailor.\nBERNICE: It’s pretty here. All these ferns.\nDOCTOR: It is. I don’t suppose you recognize this place? Anything?\nBERNICE: No. All I can see is a lagoon, the side of the mountain we just fell off, and some ferns.\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 25\nDOCTOR: So.. all in all... something of a puzzle. How do you get from a coal mine to a jungle without apparently moving an inch? I didn’t feel a transmat beam but there was something. Whatever it was, it made me dizzy.\nBERNICE: So your theory is we moved but we didn’t move? Brilliant. Great to have you back.\nDOCTOR: Ha! Got it! Go on, guess.\nBERNICE: Er .. something that’s just like a transmat but isn’t one really?\nDOCTOR: No. What’s all around us? What’s coal made from?\nBERNICE: Jungle!\nDOCTOR: That’s right: plants. Miles of rock pressing down on layers of dead plants. We’ve travelled in time, but not in space. Millions of years into the past.\nBERNICE: This jungle is what all that coal will be made of. Was made of. Was will be. I even had a fossilized fern in my hand earlier. The lion ended up traveling from here to my time. And .. your TARDIS key was in that missing pocket, wasn’t\nBERNICE: ala oa\nDOCTOR: What?!? [CHECKING, SUDDENLY PANICKED] Oh. Yes it was. Benny, we have to get it back.\nBERNICE: I already did, remember? It took a little while, though ...\nDOCTOR: Ah .. it fell on the ground after the lion attacked, then got buried, ended up embedded in a coal seam. Ha! I can’t even lose a key without it turning into an epic adventure.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 26\nBERNICE: OK. But why did we just travel back millions of years?\nDOCTOR: [AS IF IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING] It’s the TARDIS defending itself.\nBERNICE: Er.. You’re going to have to explain a little bit more than that.\nDOCTOR: One of the emergency protocols.\nBERNICE: Bit more.\nBERNICE: DOCTOR? To prevent Time Lord technology falling into the wrong hands.\nBERNICE: [NOT FOLLOWING] And it does this by sending us back millions of years?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Well, sort of. You see, the TARDIS quarantines itself. It can’t just leave time and space, not with that Venhella woman inside. So the TARDIS is creating a bubble out of a sliver of space/time, plopping the bubble out of the universe. Trouble is, there’ll be no way back once the bubble is fully formed.\nBERNICE: And that’1ll be you and me stuck here, millions of years in the past, with no escape.\nDOCTOR: Nicely put.\nBERNICE: Just us and the lions.\nDOCTOR: Either that, or we come up with a way back to the TARDIS before the bubble forms.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 27\nBERNICE: OK. Sounding promising so far.\nDOCTOR: We’ve got about ten minutes, by the way.\nBERNICE: So how do we - ?\nDOCTOR: No idea. Not a clue. Not a sausage. Sorry.\nBERNICE: Well, we - [SEEING SOMETHING] Gah!\nDOCTOR: What?\nBERNICE: There!\nDOCTOR: Where?\nBERNICE: There! Something was watching us. I saw eyes.\nDOCTOR: The lion?\nBERNICE: No.\nDOCTOR: A person?\nBERNICE: I don’t know what it was. Just look out for it while I get this jumpsuit back on.\nDOCTOR: That’s still wet. I didn’t see anything. The mind plays tricks, Benny. It was probably just branches.\nBERNICE: [muttered] I know what branches look like. They don’t have eyes. [beat] Doctor!

Show it her.\nKLARNER: Um .. all right.\nVENHELLA: [addressing the creature] This device is a manumitter.\nKLARNER: Do you think it understood? It’s .. big, isn’t it?\nVENHELLA: It transcends dimensions.\nKLARNER: I’m not sure it’s responding to what you’re saying.\nTARDIS: .. you are chained. These links go deep into many dimensions, they exist in the realm of mind as well as matter.\nTARDIS: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 30\nTARDIS: MACHINERY, BUT WITH WEIRD LITTLE COUNTERPOINTS\nVENHELLA: The manumitter will sever those chains. You will be free.\nVENHELLA: SWIRLING AND STRAINING, SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM DURING THE REST OF THIS SCENE.\nKLARNER: Judging from my instruments, the local structure of reality has become extremely volatile.\nVENHELLA: We’re making history, Klarner.\nKLARNER: I’m not sure we’re doing anything. How would we tell? We don’t understand -\nVENHELLA: You might not comprehend this. I do. The TARDIS is shaking itself free.\nKLARNER: You need to look at these readings.\nVENHELLA: ‘Need’ ?\nKLARNER: Countess, if you know what is going on, please explain it to me.

The barrier seems to be that back wall.\nVENHELLA: This may be what it is normally like inside a TARDIS. At least one in her natural state.\nKLARNER: Or we might have hurt her. The instruments all indicate that there’s a problem.\nVENHELLA: You can’t possibly read them.\nKLARNER: I think the TARDIS is .. helping me to. Translating.\nVENHELLA: Talking down to you.\nKLARNER: If you like, yes. There’s a hypersphere, a five dimensional sphere. It looks newly-formed. We’re on on dge. The faces we're seeing are outside.

We must be right on the edge of the time bubble.\nBERNICE: We’re not going to be aged like that if we hang around, are we?\nDOCTOR: We’re not going to hang around.

Doctor, it’s the thing that was chasing us. It’s beaten us here. Look, there... the wall.\nKLARNER: It’s been here hours. Appeared shortly after we entered.\nDOCTOR: You both see it, too? Hmmmm .. over here on the back wall?\nKLARNER: Stay back! It .. did this to my hand.\nDOCTOR: It did? Oh dear. Then it’s using the release of accelerated temporal energy as... well, a food source. But why can’t I see it?\nVENHELLA: It is the soul of the TARDIS, liberated from enslavement.\nBERNICE: The what of the TARDIS whatted from its what?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 37\nVENHELLA: A TARDIS should be free, not harnessed by Time Lords.\nDOCTOR: And since when was that up to you to decide?\nVENHELLA: It has rights. It will be freed from oppression.\nBERNICE: Um... Doctor, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they seem to have attached something to the console.\nDOCTOR: Now that I can see.\nKLARNER: It’s a manumitter.\nDOCTOR: I’m well aware of that. And how exactly did you get one of these smuggled out of Gallifrey? They’re illegal. Locked away.\nKLARNER: It severs the -\nDOCTOR: - telepathic link between a Time Lord and his TARDIS, but only when a TARDIS has been completely powered down. And that’s not what I asked.\nVENHELLA: I have devoted my life and my fortune to the study of the Time Lords.\nDOCTOR: Ah, the idle minds of the rich. Couldn’t you have found something better to do with your spare time? Redistribution of your ill-gotten Plutovian fortunes, perhaps? Just a suggestion, of course.\nVENHELLA: It became clear to me that your so-called mastery of time was nothing but enslavement of a far worthier species.\nVENHELLA: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 38\nDOCTOR: Species? You’re saying my TARDIS is— ?\nVENHELLA: It’s not your TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: [FINALLY SNAPS] It’s not yours, ither, Venhella. Now listen, I don’t deny your right to get involved in some so-called worthy cause - that’s apparently the prerogative of the privileged classes throughout eternity! And sometimes it can even do some good. But whatever crazy notions you’ve got into your head, the fact is that separating me from the TARDIS would be a little like ‘freeing’ a fighter plane from its pilot, mid-flight.\nVENHELLA: Typical Time Lord degenerate gibberish. The bankrupt defence of—\nDOCTOR: Look, I’m sure you mean well, but have you ever been to Gallifrey? Have you ever met a Time Lord? Ever been ina\nTARDIS: before?\nVENHELLA: I have studied the ancient texts of-\nDOCTOR: [ANGRY] Of a bunch of ancient conspiracy theorists no doubt! Look, the Time Lords are powerful. A lot of people resent that. I certainly do from time to time.\nVENHALLA: They are corrupt, decadent—\nDOCTOR: It’s arguable! And I’m not here to offer a defence. But they are not evil enslavers of their TARDISes! The\nDOCTOR: relationship between a Time Lord and his TARDIS is infinitely more complex than that. And, frankly, it’s... well, it’s private! [RECOVERS A LITTLE] Now, you’ve already caused a great deal of damage here, Countess. So, stand aside and be quiet while Benny and I think of a way out your mess.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 39\nBERNICE: Can’t we just reverse the effect of the manumitter? Somehow...\nDOCTOR: The damage is done. The manumitter should never been attached without inputting coded shutdown protocols. Idiots! That’s why the TARDIS has fully activated her defences. And the stress between that and the power of the manumitter is tearing holes into other dimensions... other universes.\nBERNICE: Oh.. great. So... how do we fight it?\nDOCTOR: Fight it? Benny, I can’t see it.\nBERNICE: What? You mean it’s down to us humans, then. Me and Klarner?\nKLARNER: Of course. I’1l1 stand with you, Professor Summerfield, we'll show it what -\nKLARNER: Aaaaaargh! [beat]\nBERNICE: Klarner!\nDOCTOR: That ‘thing’ you can see did that?\nBERNICE: Well of course it did.\nDOCTOR: Total absorption of energy.\nVENHELLA: That ‘thing’, as you call it, is the TARDIS, finally free.\nVENHELLA: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 40\nDOCTOR: Er.. It really isn’t. It’s something leaking in from another dimension and judging by what it did to poor Klarner, I think it’s hungry.\nVENHELLA: Don’t listen to his Time Lord lies. The TARDIS is breaking free and we must help it!\nBERNICE: Help it? What, that thing? I really don’t think it needs any help from us to do anything. Er... You really should get back, Countess.\nVENHELLA: No, I will help it. That’s why I’m here! To set it free!\nDOCTOR: Venhella, no!!!\nVENHELLA: [ECSTATIC] It’s incredible. Yes!\nBERNICE: Venhella!\nDOCTOR: [IN AWE] It’s consuming her.\nBERNICE: What? You can see it now?\nDOCTOR: No, but I can see th ffect of what it’s doing. It’s like it’s merging with Venhella. Why would it do that?\nBERNICE: I’ve got a question, too: why aren’t we running very fast in the other direction?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 41\nVENHELLA: [PANICKING] No! No! It’s not the TARDIS, it’s not the TARDIS! It .. it’s monstrous.\nDOCTOR: I hate to say I told you so, but you haven’t freed the soul of a TARDIS, you’ve made cracks in the fabric of the universe. And this creature has slipped through. Perhaps that’s what your ancient conspiracy theorists wanted all along.\nBERNICE: Don’t tell m the release of an unspeakable, omnipotent evil from before the dawn of time that’s going to enslave us all.\nDOCTOR: Probably not. It’s probably just hungry. And now the\nTARDIS: has trapped it in this time bubble, the only food it can find—\nBERNICE: Is us?\nDOCTOR: No, you! You, Venhella and poor Klarner. I can’t see it. It can’t see me. Clearly, I’m not to its taste... or rather,\nDOCTOR: we inhabit different energy wavelengths.\nBERNICE: Are you talking rubbish?\nDOCTOR: Possibly, but the fact remains that that creature and I could pass like ships in the night and never notice each other.\nVENHELLA: [BEING CONSUMED] Barely beyond the bounds of our universe there are strange forms of life that even the Time Lords don’t fully understand.\nDOCTOR: Couldn’t have put it better myself. This is one of those. But I think it’s just... well, an animal. A predator, if you like... bit like a shark.\nDOCTOR: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMP\nTING: FATE\nTING: And, like a shark, it eats people?\nVENHELLA: A whole universe to feed\nDOCTOR: If it ever gets free of\nDOCTOR: on ...\nDOCTOR: this time bubble.\nDOCTOR: here, it’ll eventually st\nBERNICE: tarve and die.\nPAGE: 42\nPAGE: If we keep it\nPAGE: But only after it’s eaten us.

I sincerely hope he’s not going to be that corny.\nVENHELLA: This is all my fault.\nBERNICE: That’s just about the first sensible thing I think I’ve heard you say. You shouldn’t believe everything you read in ancient texts. Ancient people are just as capable as being stupid as.. well, as you are! And if you’ve just forced the Doctor to kill himself... frankly, I might not be responsible for my actions.\nVENHELLA: [SELF PITY] All because of this thing ...\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS key. I’1ll take that, ta very much.\nBERNICE: Doctor! [BEAT] What did you just do?\nDOCTOR: Er.. I gave it indigestion... sort of. Really didn’t like me. Spat me out. Then I sealed that time bubble the TARDIS had created.\nBERNICE: Sealed it?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 45\nDOCTOR: It was just about fully formed. Then I jettisoned it back through the interdimensional hole. With the vortex shark inside it.\nBERNICE: Vortex Shark? You just made that up.\nDOCTOR: I did. Need a lift?\nBERNICE: Um... well... er... Yes. I’d like that. Bye, then, Countess.\nVENHELLA: Everyone’s dead. Klarner’s dead. The guards. You can’t leave me her\nDOCTOR: Can’t I now? Why should I help you? You nearly wrecked my TARDIS; you unleashed a carnivorous inter-dimensional...\nDOCTOR: Basically, you did a lot of bad stuff. I’m not sure I like you much at all.\nVENHELLA: I can’t even operate the lift to get back to the surface.\nDOCTOR: Try pressing the button with the ‘up’ arrow.\nBERNICE: The mechanism was damaged earlier.\nDOCTOR: Someone will realise you’re missing, Venhella. Sooner or later. By the time they arrive, you’ll have come to understand that you got off lightly.\nBERNICE: Nice meeting you, Venhella.\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 46\nBERNICE: SCENE 13. INTERIOR TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nBERNICE: I suspect there’s not much point sending her an invoice.\nDOCTOR: Venhella? I don’t know, if she was paying you to find my\nTARDIS: key, technically you did the work.\nBERNICE: If you jettisoned the time bubble into another universe, how does that affect the whole cause and effect thing?\nDOCTOR: What, about my key turning up in the distant past of this planet?\nBERNICE: That and a few other issues.\nDOCTOR: Best to leave all that clever time stuff to us decadent Time Lords.\nBERNICE: LAUGHS.\nDOCTOR: I know, instead of worrying about that, let’s go to Hedonex. It’s a spa planet in Galaxy Seven.\nBERNICE: Spa planet?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Hedonexians have five hands and do the best massages in the universe. The planet has caves that form natural saunas. A peculiarity of the mineral composition there means the rainwater tastes like champagne and natural springs bubble up warm, scented baby oil.\nBERNICE: How does that even work?\nBERNICE: COMPANY OF FRIENDS — TEMPTING FATE PAGE 47\nDOCTOR: Er.. I keep meaning to ask, but always end up getting distracted.\nBERNICE: I’1ll drink to that. I’l1l stick to rainwater, of course.\nDOCTOR: It’s good to have a plan.\nFINAL: NARRATION\nBENNY: We spent a week on Hedonax. It’s great, you should definitely go if you get the chance. After that, the Doctor took me home in the TARDIS. And because he took me home in the TARDIS.. well... he didn’t quite manage to get me there straight away..

NARRATION\nFITZ: The name’s Kreiner. Fitz Kreiner. In 1963 I was 27 years old, drudging through my days at a garden centre. I’d always wanted my life to be like one of those Hollywood movies, full of intrigue and glamour and spice. Instead, it was like one of those cheap telly efforts — dull, overlong and I didn’t understand what the hell any of it meant. Then I bumped into the Doctor. And I took the lifeline he threw out from his old police box. I wanted to travel, to see just how big life could be, how a skinny little Herbert like me could make a real difference... (BEAT) Plus, what a fantastic way of impressing the birds!\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 3\nDOCTOR WHO: (AS TITLE MUSIC FADES, OTT DRAMATIC, STRIDENT MUSIC STARTS UP\nAND CONTINUES UNDER: )\nDOCTOR: Hello. I am the Doctor. A traveller from beyond space. As you know, I’ve done what I can to defend planet Entusso from the deadly machinations of evil extra-terrestrials...\nTESTIMONIAL WOMAN: The Vermin Queens were attacking my children. The Doctor drove them back, saved my little ones, saved the whole street.\nTESTIMONIAL MAN: Genius! Got us out of the Hemjax conflagration alive. Just a genius.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS FONDLY) I do so often land up in the thick of things. And yes, I get results. But I’m strictly a tourist, just passing through.\nTESTIMONIAL WOMAN: I did wonder, what happens if these alien things attack again and we’re defenceless?\nDOCTOR: I can’t always be there when Entusso comes under attack. Luckily, now I don’t need to be, thanks to ADI — Alien Defence Incorporated.\nDEEP VOICEOVER: Alien... Defence... Incorporated. The rapid-response\nDEEP VOICEOVER: extraterrestrial call-out service.\nDOCTOR: Aliens know you’re out there. Some are benign. Some are not.\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 4\nSOBBING TESTIMONIAL MAN: Unknown aliens destroyed my settlement in the Entusso Outlands. There was no-one to turn to, no-one who could help...\nFEMOR: I’m Commander Hellan Femor, late of Entusso’s Colony Patrol Alpha. And I founded ADI to make sure this kind of atrocity will never happen again. ADI offers an instant investigation service and guaranteed protection against everything from alien abduction to full-on invasion — at very reasonable prices.\nDOCTOR: As I travel on through the stars, I’m comforted to know your lives are in safe hands — the hands of Alien Defence Incorporated. One call — one valid credit card — brings you and your loved ones the best possible protection from alien attack. Trust me, I know. I’m the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: (MUSIC AND SOUND CONTINUE DIRECTLY FROM SCENE 2, ONLY NOW SOUND TINNY AND WITH TARDIS AMBIENCE — WE’RE HEARING IT THROUGH THE\nTARDIS: TV)\nADVERT DOCTOR: (DISTORT) Remember — at the first suspicion of alien activity, contact ADI on the number on-screen now. 71-72-7771.\nDEEP: VOICE/JINGLE: (DISTORT) ADI.

Let her sleep it off.\nFITZ: Yeah, but Doctor, she won’t want to miss —\nDOCTOR: No-one can miss it. That infomercial’s going out on ten thousand channels.\nFITZ: Ten thousand? Back home we had two, and there was still nothing on. Anyway — come on. How much did they bung you?\nDOCTOR: What?\nFITZ: For doing the ad.\nDOCTOR: That wasn’t me!\nFITZ: Right. It’s so typical. I mean, I help out with the vermin queens, I get stung in the back and laid up for days — you land an advertising contract.\nDOCTOR: No. Alien Defence Incorporated are using my likeness. A hyper- animated construct, with very detailed modelling ...\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 6\nFITZ: So — they’ve been spying on you?\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily. Entusso’s a bit like Earth — television- obsessed and unusually prone to alien attack. Sam and I had to spend six weeks here once, one high-profile invasion after another...\nFITZ: Fancy.\nDOCTOR: During the Hensk uprising, one station ran non-stop live coverage — of me!\nFITZ: So you became a bit of a celebrity, then...\nDOCTOR: A bit.\nFITZ: And now you’re giving endorsements. (ADOPTS WOMAN’S VOICE: )\nFITZ: Ooooh, that nice Doctor said I should phone Alien Defence, I think I’ll give them all my money... (OWN VOICE) What’1l they\nFITZ: have you doing next?\nDOCTOR: That’s what worries me. I mean if that construct’s a product of Entusso technology it shouldn’t be able to think or act for itself. But even so, they could program it [to do anything —]\nFITZ: Hang on, what do you mean? It’s not going to be alien technology, is it? Not if ADI are protecting people from aliens...\nDOCTOR: Ah, but are they? Or is this part of a scam? The overture to an invasion?\nFITZ: What, like - a nasty alien turns up in Entusso Central and starts knackering the power supply. Mrs Mills spots them and calls ADI to sort it out — but ADI sent the nasty alien in the first place! And that tips them off that someone’s seen the nasty alien so they send another nasty alien to off Mrs Mills so they can keep knackering the power supply in peace?\nDOCTOR: Never has a theory been brought so penetratingly to life.\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 7\nFITZ: So what’re you gonna do?\nDOCTOR: First, we do a bit of a background check, see if they’re on the level.\nFITZ: Fab. Fitz Kreiner, private eye, dishes the dirt. And then?\nDOCTOR: And then, pay a visit to ADI’s headquarters...\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE TRILL OF SEVERAL SPACE-AGE TELEPHONES.

Thank you for your call.\nCALLER: (DISTORT) You gonna charge me for this?\nFEMOR: No sir, no charge for sightings.\nCALLER: (DISTORT) I called the police, they won’t do a damn thing.\nFEMOR: I’m afraid the emergency services refuse to respect the threat, sir. But we’re onto it. Thanks.\nROND: Lights in the sky? Who are these weirdos?\nFEMOR: I’1l run the vectors through our observation sats.

DOCTOR AND FITZ ARE INTRUDERS HERE, THEY SPEAK QUIETLY. )\nDOCTOR: Here we are, then. It’s midnight.\nFITZ: And ADI Head Office awaits, I know. Why d’you have to break in? Why not just make an appointment with that Femor bird?\nDOCTOR: I will make an appointment. Once I’ve searched through her files — so when I talk to her, I’1l know if she’s lying.\nFITZ: Why didn’t you just land the TARDIS inside the building?\nDOCTOR: Automated defences. The TARDIS would set off any motion detectors inside. Now then...\nFITZ: A sip from my hip little flask before you go in?\nDOCTOR: No, thanks. (SNIFFS) Is that a Bactrian cocktail? I’ve told you, you never gulp it, you [put two drops on a...]\nFITZ: You put two drops on a sugarcube, yeah, yeah. Tell you what, we’ll have a couple when you get out. Shouldn’t take you long, should it? I mean, this Femor bird checks out as war hero. ADI's properly registered, weapons cleared by the military, premises paid for by private donation —\nDOCTOR: Femor’s an old soldier. She can pull in favours from all over. But if she’s not on the level...\nFITZ: Anonymous donor could mean googly-eyed monster. I know.\nDOCTOR: Right. So, wait in the TARDIS till daybreak, and if I’m not out by then... Use the contacts I gave you. See you later.\nFITZ: You’d better. Be careful, Doctor, OK?\nFITZ: 10\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 11\nDOCTOR: Right. Entry coder here...

No, no, no —\nDOCTOR: 12\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 13\nDOCTOR: . What was in that stuff?\nDOCTOR: Ah! Come to set me free, have you? Let’s see you, then. Trussed up like this I can’t turn my head. .. Oh, fine. This is how you\nDOCTOR: want to play it, is it? The clever bigwigs of Alien Defence Incorporated gathered in their swish executive office, gloating in silence over the helpless Doctor. First you make an impostor Doctor, then you grab the real thing. What’s next, eh?\nGASTAN: Er.. I’m just the cleaner.\nDOCTOR: Pardon?\nGASTAN: I’m the cleaner. Normally I clean the Director’s office in the evening. But they were making TV pictures yesterday and —\nFEMOR: Keep holding my calls, I haven’t time now. The Doctor's... (SEES GASTAN) I’1ll call you back. (FX: BLEEP) Gastan, what the hell are you doing here?\nGASTAN: (SCARED) Cleaning, Director Femor. I have got a pass —\nFEMOR: I gave instructions my office was out of bounds! Go!\nDOCTOR: How long have I been unconscious?\nFEMOR: A good eighteen hours.\nDOCTOR: What??\nDOCTOR: 13\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 14\nFEMOR: I’m sorry for the strength of the disabling gas, but ADI is a prime target for alien attack. We have to be prepared. (BEAT) I take it, from your attempts at covert entry, you’ve seen ADI’s advertising campaign and it’s made you suspicious?\nDOCTOR: [SARDONIC] Why ask me when you could ask your replica?\nFEMOR: A good idea.\nFEMOR: (FX: SHE PRESSES A BUTTON. HUM OF POWER. DIFFERENT, SMALLER\nDOOR: OPENS)\nCONSTRUCT DOCTOR: Hello! I’m the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hardly! What are you, a level two construct?\nFEMOR: Level one, Doctor. It can’t talk as such, its speech is pre- programmed. But on the plus side it can give you a glass of water.\nCONSTRUCT DOCTOR: I get results. (GARGLES)\nDOCTOR: You converted a novelty drinks dispenser into a replica of me?\nFEMOR: Popular at parties, I believe. (SHRUGS) My budget wouldn’t stretch any further. But the construct’s brought you here.\nDOCTOR: And now you’re the one keeping me here.\nFEMOR: You broke into my premises, naturally I’ve detained you. However...\nDOCTOR: Thanks. Nice to be able to move again. So! Why are you tricking the people of Entusso, saying I endorse your organisation?\nDOCTOR: 14\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 15\nFEMOR: For their own protection, the people must trust in ADI’s effectiveness. I tried to contact you, to get your proper permission. But you can’t be contacted, can you? You’re a part- time saviour. You save worlds at your convenience.\nDOCTOR: I never set myself up as your champion!\nFEMOR: (ANGRY) You know how many times we’ve been attacked in the past. And still the world government won’t fund a central military organisation to defend against extra-terrestrials.\nDOCTOR: So you offer your own protection to individuals — at a price.\nFEMOR: We charge to cover overheads and fund expansion, not to turn a profit. I used the construct to get your attention, to draw you here. I want to recruit you as a freelance consultant, an expert.\nDOCTOR: Sorry. I don’t work for anyone.\nFEMOR: Then at least give us your endorsement for real.\nDOCTOR: That’s not how I operate!\nFEMOR: It’s not only the people I must convince of ADI’s effectiveness — it’s the aliens lining up to attack. Your association will deter certain species, that’s irrefutable.\nDOCTOR: Um... Is it? What’s the time?\nFEMOR: Huh? Six-thirty.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. I hate to refute the irrefutable... Actually, that’s not true, I revel in it. But... (SIGHS) We’ve just missed Channel One’s Six o’Clock Siren show, haven’t we. But you’1l have ViewTel Plus, right? You’d better take a look.\nFEMOR: (FX: TURNS ON TV). Give me Channel One, show One-Six-zero.\nFEMOR: 15\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: (UP-TEMPO MUSIC STARTS UP, THE SIX O’CLOCK SIREN SIG TUNE. AS IT ENDS, GEM WESTON, THE CAPABLE ANCHORWOMAN, SPEAKS )\nGEM: Good evening, I’m Gem Weston. Welcome to your top-rated Six O’Clock Siren. Coming up tonight —\nGEM: Those lights in the sky — are they really natural phenomena as the experts would have us believe, or do they herald the coming of yet more bloodthirsty aliens from space?\nGEM: And in the studio tonight we have Fitz Kreiner, space traveller and close compatriot of that world famous enigma, the Doctor. Or rather, as he sensationally claims today exclusively to the Six O’Clock Siren — Fitz Kreiner is the power behind the Doctor’s throne. The real thwarter of alien plots both here on Entusso and beyond. Mr Kreiner, welcome.\nFITZ: Good evening. Call me Fitz.\nGEM: The claims you’re making will shock millions all over Entusso.\nFITZ: I had never planned to come out with the truth. But having seen the adverts John’s made recently —\nGEM: John? You mean the Doctor?\nFITZ: His real name’s John Smith. Now you know why I had to call him\nFITZ: something more dramatic.\nGEM: A doctor, a healer of people and worlds...\nFITZ: Right. You’re very perceptive for someone so beautiful.\nFITZ: 16\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 17\nGEM: (NERVOUS LAUGHTER) The obvious question, Mr Kreiner, is what game have you and the Doctor been playing?\nFITZ: A dangerous one. But then.. I am no stranger to danger.\nGEM: We can prove that. We’ve tracked down some archive footage here of you battling the vermin queens with the Doctor.\nARCHIVE FITZ: Whoaaaa! Get away, you ugly old (CENSOR BLEEP). No! Not in the face. Ow! Come on, we can talk about it. Speako Englisho? Arrrrgh!\nARCHIVE DOCTOR: Hold on, Fitz! If I can just hook up the sonic disruptor...\nGEM: Now, you seem to be running away here ...\nFITZ: I’m distracting the vermin queen’s attention, freeing up the Doct[or] — I mean, John — so he can implement my plans. You\nFITZ: missed the bit just before this when I was giving him orders over a hidden radio mike.\nARCHIVE FITZ: Oh, yeah, take your time— OWWWWW! geddoff... Oof! Help!\nGEM: And here... It looks like you actually get stung!\nFITZ: Didn’t hurt. That’s me pretending to writhe in agony, holding their focus while John rigs up a sonic disruptor. Er... You can probably stop running this, now.\nGEM: You've been fooling people very successfully into believing that the Doctor is a vital and dynamic force, risking his life many times over for the welfare of strangers.\nFITZ: A necessary deception. You see, I’m the planner, the master strategist — saving the day but shunning the limelight. I needed someone to act as my public face, and the Doctor — John, I mean — John was the best. A fine actor, a fast learner... (GETTING CHOKED) I’m sorry.\nFITZ: 17\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 18\nGEM: Take your time. (BEAT) But please let go of my leg.\nFITZ: Sorry. Look, I’m only going public with all this now because I’m afraid for John’s welfare. See, we.. we had a run-in with some extraterrestrial life-forms, the, um, Lonniedonnegans from the Skiffle Cluster, and... John was tortured.\nGEM: They thought he was the brains of the partnership.\nFITZ: It’s left him quite unhinged — to the point where he actually believes he’s the big hero. It’s tragic. He’s even endorsing private military organisations like ADI because he wants to help and still believes he can.. And now he’s gone missing. If anyone watching knows the Doctor’s whereabouts, contact me, care of this station on... what is it? 71-71-8992 (POINTEDLY) You will contact me, won’t you?\nGEM: Coming up, those controversial adverts for Alien Defence Incorporated — are they fuelling a wave of anti-alien paranoia for private gain, or highlighting a real menace?

One last deception for Entusso?\nFEMOR: 29\nDOCTOR WHO: FITZ’S STORY by Steve Cole (002) Page 30\nDOCTOR: (PAUSE) All right. For Entusso. I’1l get off to the TARDIS, sort out the mothership, tell the Scarpoks they’ve been rumbled and the planet’s on full alert. They’re stealthy invaders, not ones for full-on combat.

Never believed it...\nFEMOR: I could actually use Kreiner’s help here.\nFITZ: Hey, baby, call me Fitz.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll see you both soon.\nFEMOR: You know, that was smart thinking of yours, Kreiner, disabling the Scarpok like that.\nROND: Kreiner? You took care of that monster?\nFITZ: Well, you know, I did my bit...\nFEMOR: Too modest. Thanks to you, ADI has actually captured an alien aggressor. That’1ll restore our credibility and make the world wake up to the extraterrestrial threat.\nROND: Yes. Yes, someone’s got to warn them.

Three words to strike fear into the heart of every British comics nerd. “Squarejaw and Aggrotron have joined forces!” As in, a couple of characters crossed over from Aggrotron. The Trembling Hand didn’t strangle anyone, just gave them a clip round the earhole. Big Bustard ran the Birdwatchers’ Page. And as for The Mangler —\nDOCTOR: What about him?\nIZZY: ‘.. Versus Big Daddy’?\nDOCTOR: Well, why not-?\nIZZY: Yeah, Big Daddy won-?!? Trouble is, I never got Issue 56, with the last ever episode of Courtmaster Cruel. I never found out his true identity!\nDOCTOR: Aren’t there specialist shops for that sort of thing?\nIZZY: No, Issue 56, no-one’s seen it!

The rumour is, the Courtmaster’s face was so horrible, so disgusting, Issue 56 got pulped!\nDOCTOR: Yes, a likely story —\nDOCTOR WHO: IZZY’S STORY by Alan Barnes (002) Page 13\nIZZY: But Grubb and Sons had a copy — and it’s going to be mine, you hear me?

I’1l1 put you on ‘The Trembling Hand’ —\nARTIST: W-what?\nGRAKK: Don’t need rulers on that, it’s all motion lines. Any smudges, we'll call ‘em blood spatter. The kids’1l lap it up!\nARTIST: No!

He is human.\nDOCTOR: He’s as human as I am. Isn’t that right — Grakk, of the Smog Worlds?\nGRAKK: You clocked me-?\nDOCTOR: The facial blotching, the puffy eyes, the need for an atmosphere full of tar and carbon monoxide — yes.\nIZZY: And that’s different from any human journalist, how?\nGRAKK: Most intelligent species look like this, Huminiscule. It’s only the less-developed ones think all off-worlders have blue skin and a lizard tongue. Hence the plastic mask in the photo —\nIZZY: So is it really ‘Grakk’?\nGRAKK: It’s ‘Valerie’ —\nIZZY: Valerie-?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: IZZY’S STORY by Alan Barnes (002) Page 25\nGRAKK: Only less-developed species think all off-worlders have names like ‘Snazz’ and ‘Narb’ and ‘Tharglox’ —\nIZZY: Alright, fair enough.\nDOCTOR: Your artists — they’re all aliens, too?\nGRAKK: You don’t think I’d use the native pencil monkeys-?\nDOCTOR: Too expensive, I suppose.\nGRAKK: No, no — cheaper. But this lot won’t get pretensions and start to think they’re Michelangelo. So, er... ?\nDOCTOR: Er-?\nGRAKK: What do you think? Y’know, about the title-?\nDOCTOR: Oh, the comic. Well, it’s [garbage -]\nIZZY: Never mind his opinion. I say it’s tops.\nGRAKK: Er, good —\nDOCTOR: But that’s not why we’re here.

Is that brilliant, or is it terrible? I can’t decide —\nCOURTMASTER CRUEL: I cannot conjure up a jury from the air —\nDOCTOR: Oh, but you can. That little spatial rearrangement trick of yours-? I think you rearranged Grakk and the Aggrotron staff —\nIZZY: Really?\nDOCTOR: Use your eyes, Izzy. There was only the one filing cabinet in the Aggrotron office, and no way could all these potted plants have lived in an atmosphere like that.\nIZZY: What, they turned them into yucca plants and furniture?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. (TO COURTMASTER) Six of your suits, six Aggrotron artists. That’s a balanced jury.\nCOURTMASTER CRUEL: Disarrange six of the Aggrotron staff.\nSUIT: 1: Disarranging —\nGRAKK: (CLEARING THROAT) Eurgh, I’m never going to abuse a photocopier\nGRAKK: again —\nCOURTMASTER CRUEL: “Spong Twunk”, Grakk the Head-Swollen.

Or an android. Or scarred.\nIZZY: Then what-? Who exactly are you-?\nDEREK: In the fifty-first century, law and order collapsed. The police couldn’t cope. Someone had to fill the vacuum. To wield the iron rod of justice!

But as Courtmaster Cruel, I soon put the wind up the criminal classes!\nDOCTOR: But you’re here, on Earth, now —\nIZZY: Why?\nDEREK: Issue 56, the one before the merger — that was the number no- one possessed.

The Courtmaster can’t have been a girl, because — because...\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) Because you didn’t see it coming?\nIZZY: . Because girls don’t belong in boys’ comics! It’s the law!\nDEREK: If anyone found out, the Courtmaster’s authority would have been destroyed.

Our intention had been to spend pleasant hours wandering on the shores of Lake Geneva - instead we found ourselves confined to the house for days on end, besieged by the incessant rain and suffocated by a dense, white fog.

One of Edinburgh’s finest.\nCLAIRE: Is there anything we can do for him?\nPOLIDORTI: We can clean him up, attempt to alleviate his suffering - beyond that, I don’t know. He should already be dead.\nBYRON: What did the fellow say his name was? Doctor -?\nMARY: Frankenstein. Doctor Frankenstein.\nCLAIRE: Odd name, never heard it before. German, d’you think?\nCLAIRE: 3: INSIDE VILLA, STUDY.\nANOTHER: DAY. THE STORM HAS PASSED. CLOCK TICKING. EVENING BIRDSONG. WATER LAPPING ON SHORE. GENTLE BREEZE BLOWING.\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: We made out a bed for our visitor in the study, so he might be warmed by the fire through the night and receive fresh air during the day. Myself, Claire and Polidori took turns to watch over him, each doing our best to attend to his injuries, but with each passing day his condition grew ever more precarious.\nMARY: INTO THE SCENE. MARY RINSING DRESSINGS IN A WATER BASIN.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 6 (BREATHING HEAVILY, MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY IN SLEEP, AS THOUGH IN A NIGHTMARE) Gemma - Destrey — Compassion —\nMARY: It’s alright. Calm, calm.\nMARY: RINSES MORE BANDAGES IN WATER.\nMARY: (CHATTING IDLY, NOT EXPECTING AN ANSWER) You’ve had a hard\nMARY: night, haven’t you? Did you lose your way in the storm?\nDOCTOR: (WAKING SUDDENLY WITH A GASP, AGITATED) The storm!\nMARY: DROPS HER BASIN IN SHOCK.\nMARY: Yes, the thunderstorm, that’s when we found you.\nDOCTOR: (CONFUSED, GASPING) No. Lightning! Only way - resurrection!\nMARY: I don’t (understand)— (YELPS IN SURPRISE)\nDOCTOR: (REALISING) The TARDIS! It must have brought me here. So where am I? (BEAT) Wait. I know you! Your face, it’s familiar.\nMARY: I’m afraid you must be mistaken. I don’t know you.\nDOCTOR: No? No, maybe I saw it in a book somewhere.\nMARY: I think you must be thinking of someone else. I’m Mary.\nDOCTOR: Mary? Mary. Yes! So I must be — yes! I know this room, those curtains, that blood-red sunset. I’ve seen it before!\nMARY: The sunset?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: Joe Turner! He never did clean his paintbrushes properly. It’s eighteen sixteen, the year after the eruption at Tambora. The discolouration is due to volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere!\nMARY: Careful, don’t try to move —\nDOCTOR: (WEAKENING) Lightning - the next storm, it must be then —\nMARY: What must be then?\nDOCTOR: (LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS WITH A GROAN, THEN BREATHING)\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: But he was gone. I remained by his side through the night, but as the witching hours dragged by, his breathing became laboured and his body was overcome with an unnatural coldness.\nMARY: 4; OUTSIDE VILLA, GARDENS ON LAKE.\nMARY: WALKING THROUGH WOODS WITH POLIDORI AND PERCY. BIRDSONG.\nPERCY: You were sitting up with him all night - again?\nMARY: Someone had to. I’m surprised you missed me.\nPERCY: We still don’t know who he is, beyond his name. ‘Doctor Frankenstein’! No-one in the town has ever heard of him.\nPOLIDORI: Mary, how was he when you left?\nMARY: The strangest thing. Despite the roaring fire in the hearth, and the blankets piled high, whenever I touched his skin it was absolutely frozen, like ice. What could induce such a thing?\nPOLIDORI: I don’t know. Nothing in my experience could (explain) -\nCLAIRE: (DISTANT) (SHOUT) Mary! Mary!\nCLAIRE: RUNNING TO THEM.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: Claire — what is it?\nCLAIRE: (BREATHLESS) I - I’m sorry, Mary. He stopped. He just stopped.\nCLAIRE: 5: INSIDE VILLA STUDY. OUTSIDE, A STORM IS BREWING. INSIDE, THE CLOCK CHIMES SIX.\nBYRON: It appears we have a corpse on our hands.\nPOLIDORI: I’ll ride into Cologne tomorrow, to make the funeral arrangements —\nPERCY: (DRUNK, HIGH) (LAUGHING CRUELLY) Seems a waste.\nCLAIRE: A waste?\nPERCY: Nobody knows he’s here. Nobody’s asked after him.\nMARY: Percy, you’re not well, you know how the laudanum affects you —\nPERCY: I propose an experiment! After the manner of Signor Galvani!\nCLAIRE: Signor Galvani?\nPERCY: Lord Byron, remember our discussion of the other night? If an electrostatic spark can occasion movement in a frog’s legs -\nBYRON: Then — I see — might not a larger electrical charge —\nPERCY: - be used to imbue a whole body with a spirit of animation. Bestow it with a ‘vital warmth’! The breath of life itself!\nPOLIDORI: (INCREDULOUS) You intend to bring back the dead?\nBYRON: (LAUGHING SUPPORTIVELY) An excellent suggestion, Percy!\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 9\nDOCTOR WHO: A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. WINDOW SHUTTERS BANG.\nCLAIRE: I don’t understand, (what) —\nPERCY: There’s a storm brewing. Thunder! We take the body to the attic bedroom, attach it to the lightning rod with wire, piano wire, so the electrostatic charge flows directly into the corpse —\nPOLIDORI: What you intend, it’s obscene, immoral -\nPERCY: But you will help me, Polidori. Isn’t that right, Byron?\nBYRON: It can’t do any harm. After all, we can hardly make the poor wretch more dead. And it might prove a novel amusement.\nCLAIRE: You mean to make his legs twitch, like the frog?\nPERCY: Who knows? Who knows what will happen!\nMARY: Percy, you can’t do this, listen to (me) —\nPERCY: Mary, don’t tell me what I can and cannot do! We can always give him a Christian burial in the morning. Come, Byron, Doctor Polidori, help me prepare the body, we don’t have much time -\nPERCY: THEY MOVE THE CORPSE, OPENING DOORS, SHIFTING FURNITURE.\nPERCY: 6: INSIDE VILLA ATTIC ROOM. A CRASH OF THUNDER. WINDOW SHUTTERS BANG.\nPERCY: (INSANE, MANIC) Hurry, hurry — Polidori, have you attached the wires?\nPOLIDORI: I have - but what we’re doing, it’s an outrage against nature.\nBYRON: Don’t take it so seriously, John. It’s only a diversion!\nCLAIRE: Yes, I think it all sounds rather fun!\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 10\nPOLIDORTI: Fun? This is madness, degenerate, abject madness.\nPERCY: There is no place for squeamishness in the quest for knowledge! One must be bold in spirit, unrestrained in enquiry —\nMARY: Percy, whatever’s got into you, stop it. Stop it (at once) —\nANOTHER: CRASH OF THUNDER. VERY CLOSE.\nPERCY: (MAD) Too late. The tempest is upon us! Come, god of Thunder, unleash your elemental fire! It is I - the modern Prometheus!\nMARY: You’re going to get yourself killed.\nPERCY: What? Yes, yes, the ladies should stand back — and you, Byron -\nCLAIRE: Isn’t this exciting? I wonder — (what)\nANOTHER: CRASH. EVEN CLOSER.\nPERCY: (LAUGHING, INSANE) Come! Lightning - the fundamental force of the universe! The ether! The spirit! Strike! Strike! Strike!\nPERCY: A MASSIVE, HOUSE-SHAKING THUNDER STRIKE. LIGHTING CRACKLES.\nCLAIRE: (SCREAMS) Oh my (God) —\nBYRON: I don’t (believe it) —\nPERCY: He’s alive! (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) He’s alive! He’s aliiive!\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: And, as we watched, the creature began to show signs of life and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. A creature that had once been a man, now transformed into a hideous monster. It heaved itself to the floor, breathing hard like a wild beast.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 11\nDOCTOR: RISING FROM TABLE. STARTS SMASHING SHELVES, JUGS, ETC.\nBYRON: Polidori — keep out of its way — John!\nPOLIDORI: (HIT, STRANGLED, THEN COLLAPSING) Aaaargh!\nPOLIDORI: FALLS WITH A DEAD THUD. MORE SMASHING AND SHATTERING.\nMARY: Everyone, stay back — (SOOTHING) - we don’t want to hurt you!\nDOCTOR: LEAVES, DOOR SLAM, THUDDING DOWNSTAIRS. BRIEF SILENCE\nSAVE: FOR CLAIRE SNIFFING AND THE ONGOING, THUNDERING STORM.\nMUFFLED: SECOND DOOR SLAMS AS THE DOCTOR LEAVES BUILDING.\nBYRON: It’s alright, Miss Clairmont, it’s gone. It’s gone. You’re\nBYRON: safe.\nMARY: Polidori, are you (alright) - ?\nPOLIDORI: (GROAN) I think so, just bruised — headache, hurts (GROAN) —\nPOLIDORI: STAGGERS, KNOCKS TABLE. POLIDORI GASPS, HURT.\nMARY: You’re suffering from concussion, sit down-\nPOLIDORI: Shelley! What have you done! What have you created!\nPERCY: (BEING STRANGED) Get off —I —\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: A demon, an abomination, a blasphemy against creation!\nBYRON: Let him go, John. Let him — go! (PULLING POLIDORT)\nPERCY: RELEASED WITH A WRENCH.\nPOLIDORI: He — you saw what he did, that thing -\nPERCY: But it worked! The lightning re-animated him. Made him live.\nPOLIDORTI: If you call that living.\nMARY: And now, he’s somewhere out there. Alone, in the storm.\nOMINOUS: CLAP OF THUNDER.\nOMINOUS: 7: INSIDE VILLA, STUDY\nOMINOUS: A LAMP BEING COLLECTED AND LIT. A HEAVY COAT BEING PUT ON.\nBYRON: You don’t intend to go after him?\nMARY: He’s our responsibility. We brought him back. What do you suggest we do? Leave him out in the wind and the rain to die?\nBYRON: At least wait until light, when it’s safer —\nMARY: Safer for us, perhaps. But not for him.\nCLAIRE: Mary, it’s too dangerous, you saw what he did to Polidori —\nMARY: I saw a creature in pain! You could see it in his eyes, he was more frightened of us than we were of him. I’m going after him.\nBYRON: Alone?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: Unless you wish to come with me? No? I thought not. Claire, put my ‘husband’ to bed, let him sleep off his flight of mania. Byron, you might like to tend to your doctor. Good-night.\nLAMP: LIT. DOOR OPENED AND OUT WE GO, INTO THE STORM.\nLAMP: 8: OUTSIDE VILLA, FOREST/INSIDE TARDIS\nMARY: TRUDGING THROUGH WIND, RAIN, THUNDER, RUSTLING TREES.\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: So I stepped out, into a dense and frightful darkness. Flashes of lightning illuminated the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire, only to be succeeded by a pitchy blackness.\nMARY: WE HEAR MARY APPROACH, TRUDGING THROUGH THE WOOD.\nMARY: Hello! Doctor! Doctor Frankenstein! It’s Mary, remember? I’m sorry, for what they did to you. I just want to help —\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: I crept on, moving deeper and deeper into the forest, until a burst of lightning discovered an incongruous object. A small\nMARY: hut, rainwater streaming down its battered wooden walls, with the words ‘Police Public Call Box’ set above an open doorway.\nMARY: Hello! Doctor?\nMARY: WE MOVE INTO THE TARDIS. LIGHTNING GROWS QUIET. NO TARDIS HUM. INSTEAD, FOOTSTEPS ON FLAGSTONES. ECHOEY, LIKE INSIDE A CHURCH.\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: I took a wary step into the structure and found myself ina vast and gloomy chamber, like the ruins of a gutted cathedral, a nightmare of buckled girders and crumbling masonry. At its centre, stooped over a brass altar, was the wretched creature.\nSHE: MOVES TOWARDS HIM, FOOTSTEPS RINGING OUT.\nMARY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (WEAK, IN PAIN, RECOGNITION) Mary.\nMARY: What is this place?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: (BREATHLESS, STRUGGLING) The TARDIS. I’m afraid you’re not really seeing us at our best! Had to come here. Stabilise my condition.\nMARY: Your condition? You mean the (lightning) —\nDOCTOR: Caught in a temporal storm. Broke through the defences. Infected us both with vitreous time.\nMARY: Vitreous time?\nDOCTOR: Corrosive. It burns. And inhibits my ability to regenerate.\nMARY: I don’t understand, your words (are)-\nDOCTOR: COLLAPSES, FALLING TO THE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: (WEAKENING) On my own this time - something to be thankful for! So long ago, so many companions, all gone now, so sad. Trix. Charley. Lucie. Alex. Todd. Rita. And you.\nMARY: Me?\nDOCTOR: We travelled together, for years. Don’t you remember? The Cybermen? The Axons? King Harold at the battle of Hastings?\nMARY: We never travelled together, you must be mistaken.\nDOCTOR: No. No. You were there, you were (one of) - so tired. Maybe it’s time to head home at last.\nMARY: Is there anything I can do?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS is a part of me. Isomorphic symbiosis. (PULLING\nHIMSELF: UP) Have to send signal! Call for help.\nHIMSELF: THE DOCTOR PRESSES BUTTONS ON CONSOLE. IT’S DEAD — NO BLEEPS OR WHIRRS, JUST THE SOUNDS OF THE SWITCHES AND LEVERS CLICKING.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: Nothing. No good. You try, she responds better to humans.\nMARY: This switch here?\nSWITCH: IS PRESSED. A LOW HUM OF ENERGY. DISTRESS SIGNAL SOUNDS.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Done it! (SUDDEN WRENCHING PAIN) Aaargh! Renewal unstable. Until help arrives, I want you (to)-\nMARY: What? You want me to what?\nDOCTOR: Under the console. High-stress cables. Tie me up, quickly. Quickly! Losing control! Might hurt you.\nMARY: FINDS CABLES AND BEGINS TO TIE HIM.\nMARY: If you’re sure?\nDOCTOR: No. Too late. Can’t hold back the tide - (ROAR OF PAIN)\nMARY: Doctor?\nMARY: Doctor - what’s happening to you?\nDOCTOR: Run! Run for your life! (ANIMAL ROAR) Or I will kill you!\nDOCTOR: 9: OUTSIDE VILLA, FOREST/INSIDE VILLA, STUDY\nBACK: OUT INTO THE STORM. RUNNING THROUGH WOODLAND.\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: I turned and fled, out into the violence of the storm, stumbling through the torrential rain until at last I saw the lights of the Villa Diodati shining through the fog.\nSHE: ENTERS HOUSE — DOOR OPENING, CLOSING ONTO THE STORM.\nCLAIRE: Mary, are you alright — oh my, you’re soaked to the skin!\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 16\nMARY: (OUT OF BREATH) I - he’s out there — after me.\nBYRON: It’s alright, the door is bolted. Nothing can get in.\nCLATRE: You should be out of those wet clothes — come through, to the drawing-room — (CALLING) Doctor Polidori! It’s Mary!\nCLATRE: THEY MOVE INTO THE STUDY. FOOTSTEPS BOUNDING DOWN STAIRS.\nPOLIDORI: What happened —\nMARY: Frankenstein. I found him.\nPOLIDORI: You’re shaking, get some brandy inside you. You found him?\nPOLIDORI: POURING.\nMARY: There was this building, out in the forest, but it (was) -\nMARY: THUMP ON THE DOOR.\nCLAIRE: (SLIGHT SCREAM) What (was) —\nBYRON: It’s him. He’s out there! He must’ve followed you.\nBYRON: THUMP ON DOOR AGAIN.\nMARY: Don’t let him in! He said, he said he’d kill me -\nPOLIDORI: Don’t worry. You’re safe with us, (now) —\nWINDOW: SMASHES.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE)\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: John, the lamp — throw the lamp!\nLAMP: THROWN.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE)\nPOLIDORI: (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Fire! It’s afraid of fire! (JOKING) Now all we need is a mob of villagers with flaming torches.\nBYRON: Help me, shift the table — we can put it up against the door, fashion a barricade —\nREPEATED: BANGING ON DOOR. WOOD BEGINNING TO BREAK AND SPLINTER.\nMARY: He’s getting through, he’s getting through!\nBYRON: Not yet he’s not!\nPOLIDORI: I fear it may be too late — heaven preserve us -\nPOLIDORI: SUDDENLY, THERE’S A FAMILIAR WHEEZING, GROANING SOUND. THE\nTARDIS: LANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCENE WITH A ROARING WIND.\nCLAIRE: What in the name of (God) -\nMARY: The structure - the one I saw in the woods, it’s the same one!\nBYRON: What?\nMARY: (READING) ‘Police Public Call Box’!\nPOLIDORTI: But it apparated out of thin air — impossible!\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS. THE DOCTOR STEPS OUT — IN PERFECT HEALTH.\nDOCTOR: Er, excuse me, sorry to burst in on you like this, but is\nDOCTOR: anybody here in any kind of mortal peril?\nMARY: (DISBELIEVING) But — you -\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 18\nDOCTOR: Yes? Hello?\nMARY: You’re the Doctor!\nDURING: THIS, THE DOOR-BANGING, SPLINTERING CONTINUES.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) Yes, I am. Now how do you know that?\nMARY: And your face. You look perfectly well, and... young.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s very generous of you to say, (but)-\nMORE: DOOR-SMASHING. AND MAYBE A BANG OF THUNDER.\nCLAIRE: (SCREAMS WITH ALARM) Lord have mercy on us!\nPOLIDORTI: Whoever you are - that creature’s still trying to get in! And\nPOLIDORTI: the way it’s attacking, that door won’t last much longer -\nDOCTOR: (LEAPING INTO ACTION) Creature? What ‘creature’?\nBYRON: (SARDONIC) The Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS, CONFUSED) Sorry, what? Did you say the ‘Doctor’?\nPOLIDORI: Doctor Frankenstein.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Frankenstein?\nMARY: You! It’s you, out there! Another you. But - not like you.\nCLAIRE: It’s breaking through — oh my God, it’s breaking through!\nDOOR: SMASHES OPEN. DOCTOR-MONSTER STOMPS IN.\nDOOR: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 19\nDOCTOR: Ah. Right. I see. Stand back, all of you. Leave this to me -\nBYRON: As you wish.\nCLAIRE: (WHIMPERING WITH FEAR) Byron, hold me!\nCLAIRE: DOCTOR-MONSTER STOMPING ABOUT, BREAKING THINGS.\nCLAIRE: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) You know who I am, don’t you? I’m here to help.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nMARY: Doctor — careful — it said it (would) —\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. (LIKE CALMING A HORSE) Woah, it’s alright. No- one’s going to harm you.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nDOCTOR: That’s it. Relax. Just look at the TARDIS key, the spinning, shining key. Your eyelids are so heavy, you can barely keep them open. And sleep. Sleep.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nDOCTOR: MONSTER FALLS TO THE FLOOR WITH A STAGGER AND THUMP.\nMARY: You did it — you did it!\nPOLIDORI: What have you done? Induced some sort of somnambulistic trance?\nDOCTOR: Yes, something like that. Now could somebody please explain to me what is going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: 10: INSIDE VILLA\nANOTHER: ROOM IN THE VILLA. STORM FADING. FOOTSTEPS DOWNSTAIRS.\nPOLIDORI: I’ve put the creature in the attic bedroom. It doesn’t appear to be in any distress. Miss Clairmont has retired for the night\nDOCTOR: Good. Good. So tell me, whose idea was all of this?\nPOLIDORI: Percy. He had this insane notion that lightning could re- animate a corpse. And that fiend upstairs is the result.\nDOCTOR: And the corpse you re-animated was me?\nMARY: He had the same voice as you, the same manner, but, well, you saw what he was like. He’d suffered the most dreadful, disfiguring burns.\nDOCTOR: And he turned up about a week ago?\nBYRON: He did.\nDOCTOR: Curious. (BACKTRACK) Sorry, sorry, did you say ‘Percy’?\nPOLIDORI: Yes.\nDOCTOR: (DELIGHT) And your name is - don’t tell me — John Polidori?\nPOLIDORI: Yes. How did (you know that) —\nDOCTOR: The Vampire! Loved that story. Except you haven’t written it yet, have you? Forget I said anything. And you’re - of course!\nBYRON: Oh, So you recognise me?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: ‘Recognise’? You’re Lord Byron! Always wanted to meet you. Love the look, by the way. Very Byronic. Well, it would be, wouldn’t it? Which means you must be Mary! Mary Shelley!\nMARY: What is this game you are playing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: And you must be why he gave the name Frankenstein! Yes! So, what year is this? Wait — that sunset, I’ve seen it before —\nMARY: ‘Joe Turner’?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes! He painted it, many times. How did you know that?\nMARY: The - the other ‘Doctor’ told me.\nDOCTOR: No. No, not another Doctor. The same Doctor. Me!\nBYRON: You?\nPOLIDORI: I think my, ah, my headache is returning.\nDOCTOR: But I don’t remember any of this, any of you, I’ve never been here before, in any of my lives. Mary, when I — when the creature - was with you, did it mention a distress signal?\nMARY: Yes. Yes, it did, yes.\nDOCTOR: Which I picked up. I thought it sounded strangely familiar. But if this Doctor isn’t from my past - Ah. Oh dear. Oh dear.\nBYRON: What? What if he’s not from your past?\nDOCTOR: Then he’s from my future. He’s a me-that’s-yet-to-be.\nPOLIDORI: A what?\nDOCTOR: But we shouldn’t be here, in the same place, at the same time.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 22\nMARY: I’m not following a word of this, but why not?\nDOCTOR: Why not? Well, because it’s terribly embarrassing, for a start!\nDOCTOR: 11: OUTSIDE VILLA, FOREST/INSIDE TARDIS A NEW DAY. WALKING THROUGH WOODS. BIRDSONG. LAPPING WATER.\nMARY: A version of you from a time that is yet to transpire, who has travelled, in the blue structure, back to this year?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s what I do.\nMARY: After being infected by this ‘vitreous time’?\nDOCTOR: Yes. He would’ve been close to death, out of his mind, unable to help himself. The TARDIS brought him to the one point in history where he would receive the treatment he required.\nMARY: From you, you mean?\nDOCTOR: No. I couldn’t do it. He needed - he needed a way of triggering a physiological renewal. A resurrection, if you like.\nMARY: (REALISING) The lightning!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The TARDIS brought him here deliberately, knowing — no, remembering! — there would be an electrical storm! Having\nDOCTOR: landed at this space-time location on a previous occasion.\nMARY: You do lead a most extraordinary and confusing life.\nDOCTOR: I know. It’s more fun that way. (BEAT) What about you?\nMARY: Me?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: Your life. Married to an idiot like Percy Shelley, I mean —\nMARY: (LAUGH) That’s my husband you’re talking about. An ‘idiot’ who will one day save your life?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Not greatly looking forward to that, to be honest. (BEAT) It’s just that - you’re not happy, are you?\nMARY: When I first met Percy, he promised me a life of adventure — we would run away together. Like characters from a romantic novel! He abandoned his wife and his child to be with me. I should’ve realised then what was to follow. But, well, I was in love.\nDOCTOR: You were sixteen, it’s allowed.\nMARY: But he doesn’t love me. He doesn’t believe in fidelity, he - he’s been having an affair with my sister. My half-sister.\nDOCTOR: Ah. And they think you don’t know?\nMARY: No, I think they find it amusing that I do. The irony is that Claire is really in love with Byron. She’s carrying his child.\nDOCTOR: And you thought my life was complicated! And Lord Byron?\nMARY: Lord Byron is in love only with himself.\nDOCTOR: So, not quite the life of adventure you’d been hoping for?\nMARY: We have no home, no money, little more than the clothes we stand in. (BEAT) We’ve arrived. Your - what did you call it? Your ‘TARDIS’ ?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Or rather, the one belonging to my future self.\nDOCTOR: THEY MOVE INSIDE. BIRDSONG FADES. CATHEDRAL AMBIENCE.\nDOCTOR: Left the doors open. How careless of me. (BEAT) Oh dear.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 24\nMARY: What is it? What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: What’s happened to you, old girl? (TO MARY) It doesn’t normally look like this. This place - it’s a wreck. A burnt-out wreck!\nMARY: The temporal storm did this?\nMARY: THEY APPROACH CONSOLE. FOOTSTEPS ON FLAGSTONES.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You catch on very fast. And because of the symbiotic relationship between my future self and this TARDIS, unless it can be restored to full working order, then neither can he.\nMARY: The health of one depends upon the health of the other?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Now, let’s see -\nCONTROLS: ADJUSTED. NOTHING. JUST SWITCHES BEING CLICKED.\nDOCTOR: Nothing. The power cells are exhausted. Unless, unless!\nMARY: Unless?\nDOCTOR: Technically speaking it’s against the rules, but if I use one of the power cells from my TARDIS, to set the ball rolling, as it were — I should be able to initiate the self-repair systems!\nMARY: With that small green crystal?\nDOCTOR: With this small green crystal, yes! (VICTORIOUS) Ha-ha!\nCONSOLE: THUMPED. POWER GRADUALLY COMING BACK ON. LIGHTS\nSWITCHING: BACK ON WITH THUNKS. TARDIS HUMM SLOWLY RETURNING.\nMARY: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: Call it a forward investment - in my own future!\nCELESTIAL: WIND RISING. ORGAN MUSIC. MAGNIFICENCE ABOUNDS.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 25\nMARY: Doctor. Could I have a proper explanation please?\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS, TRIUMPHANT) The TARDIS... is regenerating!\nDOCTOR: 12: INSIDE VILLA, ATTIC\nGENTLE: BREATHING OF DOCTOR-MONSTER. DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN.\nCLAIRE: How is the patient now, Polidori?\nPOLIDORI: Still at peace. The heartbeat is regular and strong, though oddly there seems to be, well, one more than is conventional.\nCLAIRE: Two hearts?\nPOLIDORTI: It could be a result of the mutation, I’m (not sure) —\nTARDIS: LANDING. WHOOSHING AIR ETC.\nCLAIRE: That sound — it’s the structure - like the one downstairs!\nPOLIDORI: Another ‘Police Public Call Box’! How many of them are there?\nTARDIS: HAS LANDED. CRUMP! DOOR SWINGS OPEN.\nCLAIRE: Mary!\nMARY: (RELIEF, GREETING) Claire, Doctor Polidori —\nPOLIDORI: And the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Polidori. And how is my, ah, ‘future self’?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nCLAIRE: I think the ‘being’ is stirring.\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 26\nDOCTOR: Yes. Polidori, Claire, if you could leave us for a moment.\nPOLIDORI: Is there nothing we can do to help?\nDOCTOR: Thanks for the offer, but no, no, I’1ll take it from here. Check on Percy Shelley, see if he’s surfaced yet.\nDOCTOR: CLAIRE AND POLIDORI LEAVE. DOOR SHUTS.\nMARY: Why do you wish us to be alone?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t want them to see what’s about to happen. Now that the\nTARDIS: belonging to my future self has been restored to health, it should kick-start his recovery. Isomorphic symbiosis! Watch!\nSUITABLY: MAGICAL, TINKLING, ORCHESTRAL SOUND EFFECTS AND MUSIC.\nMARY: (NARRATION)\nMARY: And, as I watched, the face of the miserable monster in the bed took on a golden glow, as though caught in a beam of sunshine at dusk. And then slowly, like molten wax, the creature’s features and form shifted and healed, until, at last, it had metamorphosed into a man of faultless aspect. The Doctor.\nMARY: DOCTOR-MONSTER:\nMARY: DOCTOR-MONSTER: (WHO WILL NOW BE REFERRED TO AS FUTURE DOCTOR) (WAKING) Who am I? What am I doing (here)? Oh no. It’s you!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Doctor. How’re you feeling?\nFUTURE DOCTOR: Fine. (REALISING) Oh no! I remember. This happened before, didn’t it? The other way round? I was you! And now, I’m -\nDOCTOR: - the other one. Yes.\nFUTURE DOCTOR: It’s all coming back to me. The temporal storm. The Villa Diodati! And you! No, don’t tell me — aren’t you with Samson and Gemma at the moment? Didn’t you abandon them in Vienna?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: In case you’ve forgotten, I was answering a distress signal — the one you sent? ‘Time Lord in need of urgent assistance!’\nMARY: (INTERRUPTING) I’m sorry, but just to be clear in my mind — you’re an older version of the Doctor?\nFUTURE DOCTOR: Well, yes, but as far as I’m concerned, he’s a younger version of me. It’s all relative.\nMARY: Right. But you shouldn’t both be here, at the same time?\nFUTURE DOCTOR AND DOCTOR: (TOGETHER) No. Absolutely not/No. Certainly not.\nFUTURE DOCTOR: You do have a point, Mary. His very presence could cause a paradox of cataclysmic proportions.\nDOCTOR: What are you talking about? You’re the one whose presence would cause the paradox!\nMARY: (SCREAM OF FRUSTRATION) Aaaargh!\nFUTURE DOCTOR: I should leave. Doctor. Nice meeting you, but we should do this less often. Take good care of yourself. After all, if you get yourself killed before you’ve become me, it (would)-\nDOCTOR: (would)- have disastrous consequences for the web of time. Yes, yes, I am aware of that! And you look after yourself, because I won’t always be around to save you.\nFUTURE DOCTOR: You? Save me? Right, that’s it. Goodbye, Mary. Goodbye, Doctor.\nFUTURE: DOCTOR STRIDES INTO TARDIS. IT TAKES OFF.\nDOCTOR: Of all the ungrateful, self-important, rude...!\nMARY: (LAUGH) But he’s you. He’s you!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Unfortunately. That’s what’s so irritating about it!\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: 13: INSIDE VILLA, HALLWAY\nDOCTOR WHO: A DOOR SWINGS OPEN TO THE SOUND OF AN ARGUMENT IN FULL FLOW.\nEVERYONE: IS TALKING AT ONCE, CUTTING IN OVER EACH OTHER.\nPOLIDORI: Your conduct over the last few days, Mr Shelley, has been beyond the pale. I wish to terminate my employment (at the earliest opportunity-)\nPERCY: [SPEAKING OVER THE END OF PREVIOUS SENTENCE ] Need I remind you Polidori, you are no more than a servant in this household, (employed by Lord Byron to do as-)\nBYRON: [SPEAKING OVER THE END OF PREVIOUS SENTENCE] John, Percy, friends, friends. We’ve had a dark night of the soul, but the storm has passed. (A walk by the lakeside will-)\nPOLIDORI: [SPEAKING OVER THE END OF PREVIOUS SENTENCE ] I tell you, if I have to spend another minute in this place with that godless reprobate, I swear I will shoot him!\nCLAIRE: [SPEAKING OVER THE END OF PREVIOUS SENTENCE ] I should wish to accompany you to the lakeside, Byron.\nBYRON: Oh, are you really so obtuse, Miss Clairmont, not to have realised I have no interest in you whatsoever. You bore me.\nCLAIRE: (BREAKS DOWN INTO TEARS) Byron, you (beast) -\nPERCY: Byron, as you know, I respect you as a friend and poet, (but I\nPERCY: cannot allow you to address Miss Clairmont in such a manner -)\nBYRON: (MOCKING LAUGH) Cannot allow?\nBYRON: A DOOR CLOSES, MUFFLING THE REST OF THE ARGUMENT.\nDOCTOR: I think we’ll leave them to it. Mary. Can I ask you a question?\nMARY: Go on.\nDOCTOR: Will you come with me?\nMARY: Come with you?\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 29\nDOCTOR: Travel with me, in my TARDIS. Be my companion. In an entirely platonic, no strings, separate sleeping arrangements sense.\nMARY: I don’t know, it seems, well, quite wildly irresponsible —\nDOCTOR: You said you wanted a life of adventure. That’s what I’m offering you. A chance to see the marvels of the universe.\nMARY: What about those friends of yours? Samson and Gemma?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’1ll be back in Vienna before they’ve noticed I’ve gone. That’s the thing about time travel. You could spend months — years — in other times, other worlds, and I could still have you back here a mere five seconds after you left!\nMARY: Your future self told me I had travelled with him. It seems it is my destiny. It appears I have no choice in the matter.\nDOCTOR: Oh, there’s always a choice. You can always stay here, with your husband - if that’s what you really want.\nMARY: He’s not my husband.\nDOCTOR: Well then.\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS.\nMARY: But before we depart. I have one question for you.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nMARY: Your name. How should I address you? Doctor ‘Frankenstein’?\nDOCTOR: No, no, no. Just ‘the Doctor’ will be fine.\nMARY: ‘The Doctor?’\nDOCTOR WHO: MARY’S STORY by Jonathan Morris Page 30\nDOCTOR: Yes. You have to remember, it’s very important. Frankenstein is the name of the monster — and not the name of the Doctor!\nTARDIS: DOOR SHUTS AND IT TAKES OFF, FOR ADVENTURES YET UNTOLD.\nTARDIS: THE END"
