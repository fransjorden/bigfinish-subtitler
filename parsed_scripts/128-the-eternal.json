What’s the last thing you remember?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 13\nNYSSA: I was with you, the engines of the Rutan ship were ‘fibrillating’. And then there was an explosion... and after that, nothing, until I woke up here.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The same for me.\nNYSSA: But what happened? I’m not a ‘postmistress’!\nDOCTOR: No. It’s as if someone has found roles for us. Trying to make us fit into the village...\nNYSSA: The village? Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you recognise it? We’ve been here before.\nNYSSA: Stockbridge! It’s just as it was, when I met Andrew. It hasn’t changed a bit! Do you think he might still be here, somewhere?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Depends on the year.\nNYSSA: And what year is it?\nDOCTOR: By the look of those cars, the double-glazing, I’d say... early twenty-first century?\nNYSSA: Very scientific!\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s only one to be really sure — go to the same place everyone else goes if they want to find something out...\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Which is?\nDOCTOR: The local pub — The Redfern Inn.

For a wedding.\nDOCTOR: A wedding?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 16\nJANE: You must be coming, everyone in the village is invited!\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course. Wouldn’t miss it for the world, would we, Nyssa? St Justinian’s, is it?\nJANE: Of course. Should hurry, though, the service is at twelve...\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Doctor. Her clothes... they’re from a different time period.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Indeed. I’m no expert, but nineteen-fifties, I'd say...\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) And something else. It can’t be twelve o’clock yet — it’s barely an hour since I woke up!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Yes. I was wondering if you’d notice that. Not to mention the fact that my trousers still haven’t dried —\nNYSSA: Jane, wasn’t it?\nJANE: Yes?\nJANE: (FX: A BRIEF SPOOKY BURST OF SCENE 24: JANE: The problem went away. And I know I should feel sad about it, but I don’t. I’m\nJANE: glad. )\nNYSSA: It may seem an odd question, but what day is this?\nJANE: You’re right. It is an odd question. Don’t you know?\nNYSSA: I’m not sure of the exact date, is it the fourth, fifth...?\nJANE: It’s the sixteenth. Of June. Nineteen fifty-two.\nJANE: (FX: AS WITH DUDLEY, WE HEAR HER STATING OTHER DATES AS WELL.\nJANE: It’s the eighth. Of July. Nineteen ninety-six / It’s the\nJANE: thirtieth of August. Nineteen seventy / It’s the twelfth of June. Ninety eighty-four. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA3: Doctor... she —\nDOCTOR: I know. Something very strange is happening here.. something to do with time.\nDOCTOR: Speaking of which, I think we’ve missed the service — oh my. I don’t believe it!\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The bride and groom.\nNYSSA: What about them? They seem perfectly ordinary to me —\nDOCTOR: It’s Harold and Alice. From the Green Dragon.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: So?\nDOCTOR: I met them, earlier today. But they were in their fifties, they’d been married for thirty years...\nNYSSA: But that couple — they can’t be more than twenty years old...\nNYSSA: (FX: CROWD HUBBUB, CHATTING. HAROLD AND ALICE DON’T SOUND YOUNGER, BUT THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHT TREATMENT ON THE VOCALS. )\nHAROLD: Ah, Doctor Smith, Miss Nyssa. Knew you’d make it in the end!\nDOCTOR: Congratulations, Harold. And Alice. Sorry about missing the, ah, happy occasion — you know how it is, unavoidably detained!\nHAROLD: The happiest man in all the world, she’s made me, Doctor. I’1l never forget it, for as long as I live!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 18\nALICE: Me neither. Gawd, I felt so nervous in there, all those eyes staring at me, I thought I was going to be sick, but now it’s done, I don’t feel so bad after all.\nHAROLD: I should hope not!\nALICE: No, I mean... oh, you know what I mean. Mister Withers.\nHAROLD: Mrs Withers.\nNYSSA: (WARNING) Doctor —\nDOCTOR: Yes, Nyssa, what?\nNYSSA: The other side of the village.\nDOCTOR: What? I expect somebody’s having a bonfire, that’s all. A bit antisocial for midsummer, perhaps, but nothing to — oh no. That’s no bonfire...\nDUDLEY: That’s the school. The village school... it’s on fire!\nDUDLEY: (FX: WE SUDDENLY WHOOSH! INTO A FLASHBACK, ‘LOST’-STYLE. THIS IS COMBINED WITH A CACOPHONY OF VOICES, NOISES FROM OTHER\nDUDLEY: SCENES.

Someone must’ve broken in.. Dudley, what are you doing?\nDUDLEY: There’s a boy in there! I saw him. At the window, waving he was.\nJANE: You can’t go in there — you’1l get killed.\nDUDLEY: Yeah but, you know me, I’m a coward, right?\nJANE: Dudley! Come back — I...\nALICE: What’s got into him?\nJANE: He says he saw someone in there. A boy...\nALICE: Harold. Where’s our Philip?\nHAROLD: I don’t know, I thought he was out playing with his friends — cowboys and indians, he was wearing his cowboy hat, last I saw.\nALICE: I told you to keep an eye on him! I told you!\nHAROLD: He’s probably just hiding, playing a game —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 20\nJANE: Dudley — are you alright — !\nDUDLEY: (COUGHING) Somebody, get the Doctor. Get the Doctor...\nALICE: Oh no. It’s our Philip. Philip!\nHAROLD: Phil boy, speak to your dad — ah, Doctor Smith! You’re here!\nDOCTOR: Okay, everyone, stand back, please, we need some air.\nDUDLEY: He was like this when I found him, Doctor — just lying there —\nNYSSA: Doctor, what —\nDOCTOR: I’m doing my best, Nyssa. Come on... come on... breathe for me, breathe!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR PERFORMS RESUSCITATION — THUMPING BOY’S CHEST, BLOWING INTO HIS MOUTH, LISTENING FOR HEARTBEAT, THEN REPEATING — I.E. ‘ONE, TWO’ — BLOWS, LISTENS, ‘ONE, TWO’ — BLOWS, LISTENS. )\nHAROLD: Come on, Philip — stay with us, lad —\nALICE: He must’ve been playing, cowboys and indians.\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS ) (GIVING UP) No. It’s no good.

THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE FADES AS WE MOVE AWAY WITH THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA:\nVICAR: (IN BACKGROUND ONLY)\nVICAR: Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ —\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Doctor — did you —\nDOCTOR: The fire at the village school? Yes.\nNYSSA: It’s as if we were really there. A part of events.\nDOCTOR: I think we were really there.\nNYSSA: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: This funeral, Nyssa... who’s it for?\nNYSSA: For the young boy, Philip. His parents, Harold and Alice were standing by the grave... (REALISATION) Where’s Harold? He was here.\nDOCTOR: It’s his funeral.\nNYSSA: But a few minutes ago... it was his wedding day!\nDOCTOR: ‘A day in the life’..? Look again now.\nNYSSA: I don’t see... They’ve gone. Everyone’s gone! The grave, it’s been filled in!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 22\nDOCTOR: Come on. There’s something I want to check.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What?\nDOCTOR: The gravestone. I thought so. Read the inscription.\nNYSSA: (READS) ‘In memory of... Harold Withers, Alice Withers and their loving son Philip.’\nDOCTOR: And that one.\nNYSSA: ‘Here lies.. Jane Potter.’ ‘Dudley Jackson.’ They’re dead, Doctor. They’re all dead!\nDOCTOR: Anything else strike you as odd?\nNYSSA: I’m not familiar with this planet’s burial traditions, Doctor —\nDOCTOR: No dates. None of the gravestones have dates!\nNYSSA: What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: Well, either the stonemason was particularly careless, or it means... all these people have died but nobody knows when.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Doctor. Was that there before?\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: On the corner of the village green...\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS! Now we’ll start getting some answers — !\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: 10: VILLAGE GREEN\nNYSSA: Do you have the key? (SHIVERS) Is it me, or is it getting cold, all of a sudden?\nDOCTOR: Should have it somewhere... (SURPRISE) Hello. It’s not locked.\nNYSSA: The console room... where is it? This is just...\nDOCTOR: .the inside of an ordinary Police Telephone Box! One desk, one stool, one electric heater. And one telephone, of course.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What could have done this to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: We can’t be sure this is the TARDIS. For all we know, it might be the genuine article...\nNYSSA: 3: Don’t tell me — there’s no connection.\nDOCTOR: No. There is. Hmmm, now let’s see —\nDOCTOR: (FX: DIALS. IT’S AN OLD-FASHIONED ROTARY DIAL — CLICK CLIIICK CLIIICK. 100.)\nDOCTOR: It’s ringing.\nDOCTOR: (FX: IT RINGS. ONCE, TWICE.

It’s me!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I realise that but... wait. I recognise that voice!\nVOICE: It’s happening just as before. Time is winding back on itself —\nDOCTOR: Winding back on itself?\nNYSSA: Doctor, what is it? Who did you speak to?\nDOCTOR: Who indeed... I’m afraid they weren’t terribly (helpful) —\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR IS INTERRUPTED BY THE PHONE RINGING. ONCE, TWICE. )\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Don’t answer it.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think I have any choice...\nDOCTOR: Hello?\nVOICE: (VIA PHONE) Ah. I wonder if you can help me.

But it’s something to do with this place, the village...\nNYSSA: Doctor, should the sun be setting dark so soon? The clouds, it’s as if they’re on fire —\nDOCTOR: Beautiful, isn’t it? But you’re right. Time’s moving too quickly...\nNYSSA: Like the couple we saw, getting married and being buried on the\nNYSSA: same day...\nDOCTOR: Yes. The villagers seem to be a part this... they might not even be aware there’s anything amiss...\nMAX: Oh no, Doctor. I think you’ll find we’re all-too aware!\nDOCTOR: Good grief, has no-one ever told — Max! Maxwell Edison! What are you doing here?\nMAX: I’ve been observing you, following you, photographing you. Ever since you arrived!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 26\nDOCTOR: Hence the, ah, binoculars — and camera with telephoto lens. Why didn’t you say hello?\nMAX: I had to make sure it was you. In my experience, you can never be too sure. Strange forces have been afoot in Stockbridge, Doctor. Strange and... mysterious forces.\nDOCTOR: (PISS-TAKING) Strange and mysterious?\nNYSSA: Doctor, do you know this... person?\nDOCTOR: I do. Nyssa, meet Max. A blast from my past — or possibly from my future. (ASIDE) He’s what you might call a flying saucer nut. In the, ah, nicest possible way!\nNYSSA: (UNCONVINCED) I see.\nDOCTOR: He stumbled into the TARDIS once... The night that stars fell on Stockbridge...\nDOCTOR: 11. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM\nMAX: Oh! My! Good! Ness!\nDOCTOR: Ah... I wouldn’t touch that if I were you...\nMAX: (COUGHS) Er... Welcome, my friend — welcome to Earth! I am Earth ambassador Edison, and I take great pleasure in —\nDOCTOR: What are you doing here?\nMAX: I tracked your craft to Earth with my ‘bio-kinetic energising ray’...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 27\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) (INCREDULOUS) A bio-kinetic energising ray?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Yes. Well, it was just an empty box with a few loose wires... but\nDOCTOR: it turned out he really had detected an alien spacecraft...\nDOCTOR: 12. ALIEN SPACESHIP\nMAX: Doctor... I can sense a presence here... I’m v-very sensitive to these things! It speaks to me of emptiness — a vast, aching\nMAX: emptiness! And lonely! So v-v-very lonely!\nMAX: 13. ALIEN SPACESHIP\nMAX: It wasn’t me. Not me. It was the thing! The thing in the dark. I didn’t call out, it wasn’t my voice. It wasn’t my voice!\nMAX: 14. WOODLAND AT NIGHT\nMAX: Is this goodbye, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: For a while, Max... though I daresay we’ll bump into each other before long...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: 15. VILLAGE GREEN\nDOCTOR: Maxwell Edison! You haven’t been blundering into any more UFO’s, have you?\nMAX: Not so many, no. But still on the look-out! Keeping the old eyes peeled for another visitation from Venus! Just in case! All in a day’s work for planet Earth’s first line of defence!\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Doctor, are you sure he’s quite (sane)-\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) The thing is, Nyssa, he does actually seem to possess some genuine extra-sensory ability — a sixth sense —\nMAX: Doctor, who’s your, er, ah, young friend —\nDOCTOR: Max. This is Nyssa.\nMAX: Ah-ha! Honoured to make your acquaintance! Are you from Venus too?\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find that neither of us is.\nMAX: Oh. Righty-ho! Wires crossed, as usual!\nNYSSA: The Doctor says you’re interested in.. flying saucers?\nMAX: Oh yes! Expert in all things paranormal, supernatural and extra-terrestrial! Basically, if it’s anything to do with the unknown, I know all there is to know about it. That’s why you’re here, to investigate all these phenomenons we’ve been having, am I right?\nDOCTOR: Something like that. Tell me, how long have these phenomena been occurring?\nMAX: Hard to say. Sometimes it feels like centuries, sometimes like it’s only just started. It’s like.. the same day. But with all the stuff that’s happened in the past sixty years.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA3: All the births and deaths?\nMAX: Exactly! Everything! All sort-of jumbled up. You’ve seen it — the fire at the school, that was twenty years ago, while Harold from the Green Dragon, his funeral was only last year. Hang on — I’ve got it all written down in my notebook... it’s in one of my anorak pockets, somewhere — just a mo —\nDOCTOR: And it’s always the same?\nMAX: What? Oh yes. Always. The same day of late summer. It’s like those perfect summers you remember, from when you was a kid, when every day was clear blue... and your mum would be yelling at you to stop reading that book and go and get some fresh air.\nNYSSA: But this summer really is going on forever?\nMAX: Yeah. Autumn never comes.\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) ‘Thy eternal summer shall not fade’...\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS THE DOCTOR SAYS THIS, WE GET A SPOOKY, ACROSS STEREO- BURST OF HIM AND NYSSA — AS THE LORD AND LADY — RECITING THE NEXT FEW LINES OF THE POEM — NOT IN SYNCH, BUT OVERLAPPING. Thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou growest.)\nDOCTOR: So Stockbridge really is the village where nothing ever changes.\nMAX: Apart from the ghosts in Wells Wood. They’re new.\nDOCTOR: Ghosts? What ghosts?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: 16. PUB\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A NORMAL EVENING.

The usual?\nHAROLD: Pint of best for me, and Alice — ?\nALICE: White wine. Something to cool me down!\nDUDLEY: Been a right scorcher today, hasn’t it? There you go...\nHAROLD: (DRINKS) Oh, I needed that. Eh, you’1l never guess what that —\nHAROLD: (FX: SUDDENLY THE CHATTERING, MUSIC AND LAUGHTER STOPS AND EVERYONE TALKING FLATLY, BUT WITH AN EERIE VOICE EFFECT. )\nHAROLD: The new arrivals are not conforming to their pre-ordained roles.\nALICE: They will co-operate — when they realise there is no alternative.\nHAROLD: They cannot be permitted to interfere with the established pattern of events.\nDUDLEY: The Lord and Lady of the Manor will know what to do. They must be consulted.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: 17. WOODLAND AT NIGHT\nDOCTOR: And these ghosts have only started appearing recently, you say?\nMAX: That’s right. Not far now. I spotted them a few weeks ago, I think. Or days. Anyway, I had this feeling — a sort of ominous prickling, like you get before a thunderstorm — and I observed these mysterious lights coming from Wells Wood. So I, er, investigated!\nNYSSA: And what were these ‘ghosts’ like?\nMAX: You’1ll see for yourself. They always turn up, the same place, the same time.\nDOCTOR: That’s very... considerate of them. The dead aren’t usually known for their punctuality.\nMAX: This is it. There should be a spectral manifestation any time now. (BEAT) Ish.\nNYSSA: Doctor, this is ridiculous. The man is clearly (deranged)... oh\nNYSSA: my —\nNYSSA: (FX: WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE GHOSTS MATERIALIZING OUT OF THIN AIR. ALL IS STILL SAVE FOR BREATHING, AS THOUGH THROUGH A GAS MASK. )\nDOCTOR: Your ghosts, Max?\nNYSSA: But... but they’re wearing spacesuits!\nMAX: I know! Creepy, eh?\nNYSSA: Ghosts... in spacesuits!\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) Environmental protection suits of some kind, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 32\nMAX: Lumme... There’s more, this time... usually there’s only two or three.\nNYSSA: Doctor, they’re getting closer. I think they can see us!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Nyssa. Ghosts can’t hurt you. But, just to be on the safe side, probably best to keep out of their way —\nMAX: Strange. They’ve never manifested themselves this solidly before...\nNYSSA: Doctor, I think... they’re trying to communicate —\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, keep back.\nNYSSA: I can see... there’s someone inside the space suit! I can make out their face...\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, watch out — don’t let it touch you —\nDOCTOR: (FX: NYSSA GIVES A SUDDEN ABRUPT SCREAM WHICH DISTORTS, ECHOES, AND FADES AWAY. THE GAS MASK BREATHING ALSO CUTS OUT ABRUPTLY. )\nMAX: Oh cripes! They’ve gone. They’ve all gone!\nDOCTOR: And they’ve taken Nyssa with them.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE CLIFFHANGER\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 33"

THE GAS MASK BREATHING ALSO CUTS OUT ABRUPTLY. )\nMAX: Oh cripes! They’ve gone. They’ve all gone.\nDOCTOR: And they’ve taken Nyssa with them.\nDOCTOR: 19. PUB.\nDOCTOR: (FX: EVERYONE IS STILL TALKING FLATLY, WITH THE EERIE EFFECT ON THE VOICES. DUDLEY IS SPEAKING ON A TELEPHONE)\nDUDLEY: I understand, your Ladyship. (HANGS UP. ALOUD TO THE\nVILLAGERS: ) The Lord and Lady confirm — the new arrival, the girl, Nyssa, has left the village.\nHAROLD: Left the village? But (how) —\nDUDLEY: The integrity of the boundaries is weakening. The temporal intruders must have found a structural vulnerability. Broken through.\nALICE: She must return. She is part of the enduring pattern.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 34\nHAROLD: But if she does not? What then, for us?\nALICE: She will. She has no choice. She cannot escape her destiny.\nDUDLEY: The Lord and Lady desire that the Doctor be made to understand what is at stake. That his actions threaten the continued existence of everyone in the village.\nHAROLD: And if he still does not wish to ‘co-operate’?\nDUDLEY: He has no choice. The alternative is his own death.\nDUDLEY: (FX: AND SUDDENLY WE RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE IN THE BAR, WITH THE MUSIC, LAUGHTER AND DARTS MATCH CONTINUING AS BEFORE)\nDUDLEY: There you go...\nHAROLD: (DRINKS) Oh, I needed that. Eh, you’ll never guess what that idiot Edison’s gone and done now.\nDUDLEY: No, what?\nALICE: We saw him, last night. Out on his motorbike again...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: 20. WOODLAND AT NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: Nothing like this has ever happened before, Max?\nMAX: Never. I never got that close before. And they never hung around long enough!\nDOCTOR: And you have absolutely no idea where the ghosts came from?\nMAX: Nope, none at all. Except, you know, ‘from beyond the grave’!\nDOCTOR: Hmmm. Those suits they were wearing... environmental hazard suits. The technology wasn’t that far developed. Earth, human, early twenty-first century at the latest.\nMAX: Crikey — you mean, they’re from now? (BEAT) Aren’t ghosts normally from the past?\nDOCTOR: The word ‘normally’ isn’t really applicable where ghosts are concerned, Max.\nMAX: Point taken.\nDOCTOR: Besides, I’m not sure they were ghosts. Psychic projections of some kind, yes, but they were reacting to their surroundings. They deliberately moved towards Nyssa.\nMAX: So these, um, ‘psychic projections’... where do you think they’ve taken her?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know...\nMAX: Or do you think she’s just snuffed it?\nDOCTOR: Max, if you can’t say anything helpful!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 36\nMAX: I mean, we don’t know, they could’ve just (zapped)... (REALISES) Put a cork in it. Right. Understood. Say no more. Hint taken. Fair enough.\nDOCTOR: Hello... The dawn chorus, if I’m not much mistaken. Nights don’t last very long around here, do they?

Nearly at the top!\nMAX: Oh, crumbs... Some of us aren’t as young as we used to be, Doctor! And I’ve never been what you might call a cross-country person. I don’t have the knees.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense, Max. Fresh air, exercise, do you the world of good! There should be quite a view...\nMAX: (MUTTERING) It’s pointless, though. You won’t get anywhere...\nDOCTOR: We'll see about that! (DEEP BREATHES) Now. Sunrise to the southeast, so that makes that.. due North. So the next village across the valley must be...?\nMAX: Hang on, let me get my breath back... Right. (BEAT) Ash Norton. That’s the next village. But, Doctor, if you’d only listen to me, you’re wasting your time —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 37\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Can’t be more than a couple of miles away as the crow flies.\nMAX: Oh, don’t mind me, you carry on. I’1l wait for you back at the village — you'll see...\nDOCTOR: Downhill all the way! Just along the lane, cut through those trees and (we’1l) —\nDOCTOR: 22. VILLAGE GREEN\nDOCTOR: - Stockbridge. The village green.\nMAX: You can’t leave. I did warn you.\nDOCTOR: But I can’t have got lost, I have an unerring sense of direction. I walked due North, kept on walking in a straight line.. only to end up precisely back where I started!\nMAX: It’s the same, whatever direction you go. I’ve tried it.\nDOCTOR: You have?\nMAX: You go out of Stockbridge one way, you’1ll end up going straight back in the other.\nDOCTOR: But we could see the next village.\nMAX: It’s like there’s a circle you can’t cross, with the green at the centre. I’ve measured it and everything. I’ve even fashioned a rudimentary map, if you fancy a look —\nDOCTOR: So.. an illusion. Reminds me of a town I once visited. But that was entirely artificial, a space-time-trap brought into existence by a madman...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 38\nMAX: What, Milton Keynes?\nDOCTOR: (IGNORING THAT) This is different, though. It’s not only the Spatial dimensions which are affected. It’s as if... it’s as if we’re enclosed within a four-dimensional sphere. Yes! A time bubble!\nMAX: A bubble?\nDOCTOR: With no edges. No corners. And unfortunately for us, no visible exits!\nMAX: Then Nyssa...?\nDOCTOR: Outside the bubble? Fingers crossed, eh?\nDUDLEY: Morning, Doctor Smith, Maxwell. Doing your rounds?\nDOCTOR: What? Yes. Just, ah, doing the same things I do every day, you know how it is.\nDUDLEY: You might want to look in on old John at the General Store. He’s been laid up, oh, for about as long as I can remember.\nDOCTOR: Old John? I’11 do that.\nDUDLEY: Be a shame if he couldn’t make the celebration.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, it would. (BEAT) Sorry? Celebration?\nDUDLEY: You do wander around in a daydream, don’t you, Doctor? Mind on higher things, no doubt. Haven’t you noticed the bunting? The flags? The maypole over on the green?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 39\nDOCTOR: Yes. You know, I could’ve sworn that wasn’t there a moment ago. And all the bunting and flags are in honour of what, exactly?\nDUDLEY: Oh come on, isn’t it obvious?\nDOCTOR: Well, I imagine it’s to commemorate some anniversary or other —\nDUDLEY: It’s the Coronation!\nDUDLEY: (FX: AS BEFORE, WE HEAR ECHOES OF OTHER TIMES:\nDUDLEY: ..It’s the Silver Jubilee / ..It’s the Royal Wedding /.It’s Victory in Europe.)\nDOCTOR: Of course. It’s the... event which you just described, Mr Jackson...\nMAX: (SOTTO) Like I told you, Doctor. All jumbled-up and happening at once!\nDUDLEY: It’ll be a day to remember and no mistake. The whole village’1l\nDUDLEY: be turning out, there’1ll be a coconut shy, egg and spoon race, welly-throwing, (and) —\nDUDLEY: 23. RIVERSIDE\nDUDLEY: (FX: TWENTY YEARS EARLIER. DUDLEY AND JANE LAUGHING. SPLASHING. JANE IS ALREADY IN THE WATER; DUDLEY ON THE BRIDGE OVER IT)\nJANE: Come on, jump! Water’s lovely.\nDUDLEY: The bridge isn’t safe, I’m not doing it —\nJANE: Oh, what are you? (MOCKING) Coward! Come on, Dudley! Jump!\nDUDLEY: Don’t call me a coward. (JUMPS)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: 24. RIVERSIDE\nJANE: I love it here. So peaceful. Beautiful, like... a picture postcard. I tried painting it once. Watercolours. ‘The river Stock and the old bridge’ — well, what’s left of it.\nDUDLEY: Dates back to medieval, apparently. They named the village after it. You should have another go, I’ve seen your stuff. You’re not bad.\nJANE: All just crumbling away, overgrown with moss. Makes you feel so.. there’s something comforting about ruins, don’t you think? Romantic. Everything going back to nature.\nDUDLEY: We should get married.\nJANE: What?\nDUDLEY: After what you told me, last night, about —\nJANE: Our little problem?\nDUDLEY: I’ve thought about it. It’s not a problem — if we get married. I mean, I love you, you love me. We’d probably have got married anyway, sooner or later, so, why not get it out of the way?\nJANE: Is this you proposing?\nDUDLEY: What do you want, rings and violins? I’m asking. Yes.\nJANE: You could at least give me a rose.\nDUDLEY: Would a wild primrose do? So what do you say? How about it?\nJANE: You make it sound like you’ve already decided for me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 41\nMAX: You see, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think so, Max. We’re experiencing his memories. Some sort of psychic flashback...\nMAX: No. This is his actual past... but happening here and now. (BEAT) Keep watching, they’1ll be back any second...\nDOCTOR: Their clothes are different —\nMAX: Well, it is two weeks later...\nJANE: You haven’t told them? You haven’t?\nDUDLEY: They were pleased. Excited. I didn’t know it was supposed to be a secret.\nJANE: The last thing I want is your parents (steaming in) —\nDUDLEY: I’m sorry. God!\nJANE: So here we are, back where we started...(BEAT) You know our little problem?\nDUDLEY: What?\nJANE: (SWALLOWS, NERVOUS) It went away. The problem went away.\nDUDLEY: (PLEASED) You mean, you’re (not) —\nJANE: And I know I should feel sad about it, but I don’t. I’m glad.\nDUDLEY: Glad?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 42\nJANE: I’m sorry, Dudley. I don’t want to marry a man whose life’s ambition is to work in a pub for his father. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life here with you — or with anybody.\nDUDLEY: What’s wrong with it?\nJANE: It’s not new. I want to see new things. Meet new people. Not be stuck with the same people I grew up with, day-in, day-out, forever and ever, till death us do part, amen.\nDUDLEY: (GRABBING HER) So that’s it? That’s — Jane!\nJANE: Dudley, I’m- (SHE STUMBLES ON THE CRUMBLING THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE) Aaaaaaah!\nJANE: (FX: JANE SCREAMS, FALLS. WHOOSH FORWARD TO FIVE MINUTES LATER. DRAGGING. GASPING. DUDLEY’S DRAGGED JANE’S BODY FROM THE RIVER. )\nDUDLEY: Doctor Smith! Thank God you’re here, you’ve got to help us —\nDOCTOR: What — what happened?\nDUDLEY: Down here, in the river — it’s Jane.\nDOCTOR: Jane? Oh no...\nDUDLEY: She slipped. We were standing on the bridge, talking and she just... slipped.\nDOCTOR: She’s dead. She must’ve hit her head on a rock. It would have happened instantly.\nDUDLEY: No, no. She’s knocked out, that’s all. She’s just sleeping. Jane, wake up. Jane...!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 43\nDOCTOR: What were you doing up there, anyway? You should realise the old bridge isn’t (safe)\nDUDLEY: It was an accident. One minute she was standing there, the next the edge just gave way —\nDUDLEY: 25. VILLAGE GREEN\nDUDLEY: (FX: BACK WHERE WE STARTED. CELEBRATION NOW IN SWING. CHATTER. LAUGHTER. MUSIC — A GRAMOPHONE OR RADIO. CHILDREN PLAYING. )\nDUDLEY: So what’1ll it be, Doctor? We have orange juice, lemonade or ginger beer?\nDOCTOR: (DISORIENTATED) What... er, ginger beer.\nMAX: And for me, the same.\nDUDLEY: Saddest day of my life, that was. Tch, as clear now as if it was yesterday.\nDOCTOR: (SYMPATHETICALLY) Yes, I’m very sorry...\nDUDLEY: Though, of course, it was yesterday. And today.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, what?\nDUDLEY: My Jane. She dies, the same way, every day in Stockbridge.\nDOCTOR: And you’re conscious of it? You experienced the flashback too?\nDUDLEY: Of course. I must’ve gone through that day a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand... more times than I care to remember.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 44\nDOCTOR: And it’s always the same?\nDUDLEY: And breaks my heart the same, too. It was... it was like, that day, I lost a whole life that might’ve been. That’s this place for you. (BEAT) There you go. One ginger beer.\nMAX: It’s the same for everyone, Doctor. It’s like that film, Groundhog Day. Oh, I loved that film, must’ve seen it a hundred times. Which is a bit ironic, come to think about it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you Max.. So, you mean to say, Dudley, you live through the events of the same day, the day that Jane died, over and over again?\nDUDLEY: Not just that day, Doctor. Every day. We have our whole lives over again, every time the sun comes up. Every joy, every heartbreak. Every love, every loss...\nALICE: The village school. The village school — it’s on fire!\nDOCTOR: Oh no, not again...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: 26. SCHOOL.\nHAROLD: Anyone in there?\nJANE: I don’t know, I-\nHAROLD: You’re the schoolmistress. Is there anyone in there?\nJANE: There shouldn’t be, I keep it locked up, always. Someone must’ve broken in... Dudley, what (are) —\nDOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt but.. but shouldn’t you be dead?\nJANE: I know, I know, I fell off the old bridge to my death. But I’m alive again now.\nDOCTOR: Right. I see. No I don’t. Never mind. Out of my way — !\nDUDLEY: There’s a boy in there! I saw him. At the window, waving he was.\nJANE: You can’t go in there — you’ll get killed.\nDUDLEY: Yeah but, you know me, I’m a coward, right?\nDOCTOR: Wait. Dudley. I’m going with you. Two of us might make a difference!\nDUDLEY: Whatever you say, Doctor —\nDUDLEY: (FX: CRASH OF DOORS. WHOOSH OF FLAME. SCREAMS AND COMMOTION. WE’RE INSIDE THE BURNING, CRACKLING BUILDING THIS TIME. )\nDOCTOR: (COUGHING) Where is he? You must remember?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 46\nDUDLEY: (COUGHING) Over there. By the window. Same place he always is.\nDOCTOR: (HEAVES HIM UP) I’ve got him. He’s breathing. Yes! He still has a chance! Come on. Outside! Before this whole (place) —\nDUDLEY: Watch out, the roof’s coming down — !\nDOCTOR: Keep against the wall, flat against it. Now edge, towards me. That’s it. Now, run!\nJANE: Dudley — are you alright — !\nDUDLEY: The Doctor, he —\nALICE: Oh no. It’s our Philip. Philip!\nHAROLD: Phil boy, speak to your dad — ah, Doctor Smith, you’re here!\nDOCTOR: Okay, everyone, stand back, please, we need some air. (SOTTO) Come on.. come on! It has to be possible to break the pattern... just this once, somebody lives...\nHAROLD: Come on, Philip — stay with us, my lad —\nALICE: He must’ve been playing cowboys and indians.\nDOCTOR: (GIVES UP) No. It’s no good. It’s just like before. He’s —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: 27. VILLAGE GREEN\nDUDLEY: Always the same. I’m too late to save him and Philip Withers never wakes up...\nDOCTOR: You mean... you can’t do things differently?\nMAX: (TRYING TO GET HIS ATTENTION) Doctor...\nDUDLEY: It doesn’t work like that. Wish it did. Hello... looks like they’ve started the egg and spoon race. Between you and me, I’ve got a fiver on the Baxter boy.\nDOCTOR: And you just put up with this?\nMAX: Doctor...!\nDUDLEY: (ENCOURAGING) Come on! (TO DOCTOR) Eh? What? What choice do we have?\nDOCTOR: You always have a choice!\nMAX: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (RESPONDING TO MAX) Max, what?\nMAX: The phone, in the Police Box, on the village green. It’s ringing!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: 28. POLICE BOX\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOORS FLUNG OPEN. RINGING LOUDER. RECEIVER PICKED UP. THE VOICE AT THE OTHER END IS DISTANT. IT’S NYSSA FROM SCENE 55.)\nDOCTOR: Hello?\nNYSSA: (VIA PHONE) Doctor. Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can hear you.\nNYSSA: If you can hear me... go to the woods tonight. Where I was taken. I’m coming back for you. I’ll show you the way through. Go to the woods, tonight — (SCREAMS)\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: (FX: IT’S THE DOCTOR’S OWN VOICE, DISTORTED, PLAYING BACK AT HIM. )\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! Nyssa!\nMAX: No luck?\nDOCTOR: Good news, Max. Nyssa’s alive.\nMAX: Alive! Well I’1l be blowed! So those space-suited ghost-things didn’t vaporise her?\nDOCTOR: No. And not only that. I think she might have found us a way out...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: 29. BEDROOM\nHAROLD: Ah, Doctor Smith. Here at last.\nDOCTOR: I came as soon as I could... no I didn’t. I was just talking with Max, on the village green. Which rather begs the question, why am I here, now?\nHAROLD: It’s Alice, Doctor. She doesn’t have long left.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, I’m not really a medical Doctor, there’s not a great deal I can do.\nHAROLD: I know. It’s just good to have you around. For her final moments.\nDOCTOR: Wait... Yesterday, at the church. You were the one being buried. And Alice was alive!\nHAROLD: Oh, that. Happens all the time, I shouldn’t let it worry you.\nDOCTOR: But if Alice dies first.. how can she be at your funeral?\nHAROLD: We all die, Doctor. And we come back. There’s no death here.\nDOCTOR: No death?\nHAROLD: It’s hard to explain. It’s like... sunrise following sunset. You close your eyes, then you open them again the next morning. It doesn’t hurt. It’s nothing to be afraid of.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure that’s very comforting — but you actually remember dying?\nHAROLD: Nothing unusual in that. (BEAT) She’s going, Doctor. This is how it always is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 50\nHAROLD: It’s alright, dear. I’m with you. Here, let me warm your hand, love... (RUBS HAND)\nDOCTOR: ‘How it always is’? How many times as this happened?\nHAROLD: For about as long as I can remember. Can’t remember a time when it didn’t happen.\nDOCTOR: Then why, Harold, haven’t you got used to it? Why is it still affecting you?\nHAROLD: It’s my Alice, Doctor. She’s my girl. I can’t help it.\nDOCTOR: But why? If you know you’re going to see her again tomorrow... why the tears?\nHAROLD: It doesn’t get any easier, Doctor. It still hurts the same, like new. It still...\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nHAROLD: Until next time, Alice. Until next time. (BEAT) It’s the price we pay, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The price you pay? For what?\nHAROLD: For this, Stockbridge. For the chance to live forever. In heaven.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t heaven, Harold. This is somebody’s idea of hell.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: 30. BEDROOM.\nALICE: Ah, Doctor Smith. It’s good to see you.\nDOCTOR: I came aS soon as... wait a moment. Alice, you’re alive!\nALICE: Of course. It’s not about me, Doctor. It’s about Harold.\nDOCTOR: Your husband...?\nALICE: It’s his lungs. I don’t think he’s got very long left, bless him.\nDOCTOR: But just now.. you were dying. And he was at your bedside.\nALICE: Oh, I know that.\nDOCTOR: You know?\nALICE: I remember. We like to take turns. He’ll be there for my death, and I'll be there for his.\nDOCTOR: And nothing about that strikes you as peculiar at all?\nALICE: That’s Stockbridge. Things don’t always happen in the right order. Can I get you a cup of tea? I’1ll make it just as you like it.\nDOCTOR: No, no, I’m fine. But I still don’t understand... you go through this every day?\nALICE: It’s hard to bear. Truly. Not so much with Harold, because he’s had a long life, and we've had a hundred happy moments together. But with our Philip... that’s what hurts.\nDOCTOR: I tried to save him, but-\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 52\nALICE: - but it can’t be helped. I know. There’s nothing anyone can do. But we have so little of him to remember, you see. He should’ve grown up... but we never got to see that. When our Philip was taken, it wasn’t just him they took. They took away our future.\nALICE: 31. CHURCHYARD.\nVICAR: (IN BACKGROUND, FROM SCENE 9) Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here etc etc.\nMAX: (BREATHLESS) Doctor, there you are, I’ve been searching all over for you —\nDOCTOR: And what about you, Max?\nMAX: Me?\nDOCTOR: You’re part of the village. Are you endlessly re-living your... ‘edited highlights’ like the rest of them?\nMAX: It’s the same for all of us.\nDOCTOR: Stuck in an endlessly recurring nightmare! From which you can never wake up...\nMAX: It’s not just the bad stuff, Doctor. We get to re-live all the good stuff too. Like when I predicted that meteor shower, you remember that? I was a hero in the village for weeks after that, they even had me give a talk at the local school. It was the only time I ever felt like I really belonged —\nDOCTOR: Yes, very touching, but I don’t know how you can bear it. I couldn’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 53\nMAX: It’s the price we —\nDOCTOR: Price? That’s what Harold said. What sort of ‘transaction’ is this?\nMAX: (RELUCTANT, BITTER) Life eternal is the ‘gift’ of the Lord and Lady of the Manor.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nMAX: The Lord and Lady. Without them, this place wouldn’t exist. And they... help us. Whenever the pain of reliving the past gets too much... they take it away.\nDOCTOR: They do what?\nMAX: They make us forget.\nDOCTOR: But only so you can experience it again afresh. You haven’t answered my question. Who are these mysterious benefactors of yours?\nMAX: I told you. They.. they are the Lord and Lady. Of the...\nDOCTOR: Of the Manor. Yes. Odd, that. I don’t recall Stockbridge ever having a manor.\nMAX: It’s always been there, for as long as I can remember. On the other side of Well’s Wood, near the castle ruins.\nDOCTOR: The castle ruins... but that’s where — (CUTS OFF TRAIN OF THOUGHT) It’s getting dark. And cold. Strange. You know, it’s almost as if the days are getting shorter.\nMAX: They can’t be...\nDOCTOR: But you’re not sure, are you? Maybe Autumn is on its way after all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 54\nMAX: Where’re we going?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you want to leave this village, Max?\nMAX: I.. I’m not sure, it’s not that simple —\nDOCTOR: Nothing worthwhile ever is. Or would you prefer to remain here, going round and round in circles like... a goldfish in a four- dimensional bowl?\nMAX: I like goldfish.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Max! We have an appointment to keep!\nDOCTOR: 32. PUB.\nDUDLEY: Y’aright, Harold — what’ll it be? The usual?\nHAROLD: Pint of best for me, and Alice — ?\nALICE: The stargazer has never conformed to the village. He has never been one of us.\nDUDLEY: He is mentally erratic. A.. fantasist. He still believes he can hold out against the Lord and Lady... Of all us, he alone resists their psychic influence.\nHAROLD: Such... ingratitude.\nALICE: He is attempting to escape with the Doctor. They are heading for Well’s Wood.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 55\nHAROLD: The structural vulnerability. Where the temporal intruders broke through!\nDUDLEY: The Doctor must not be permitted to leave. He must never be permitted to leave.\nDUDLEY: (FX: AND SUDDENLY WE RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE IN THE BAR, WITH THE MUSIC, LAUGHTER AND DARTS MATCH CONTINUING AS BEFORE)\nDUDLEY: There you go...\nHAROLD: (DRINKS) Oh, I needed that. Eh, you’ll never guess what that idiot Edison’s gone and done now.\nHAROLD: 33. WOODLAND AT NIGHT\nMAX: Outside the bubble?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa said to meet her at Well’s Wood tonight. Our way out of here!\nMAX: Er.. I’m not sure that’s such a good idea —\nDOCTOR: What is it you’re so frightened of?\nMAX: «you don’t want to know. Things. Important, dreadful, terrible things.\nDOCTOR: Fine. Your decision. But I hope you won’t mind if I choose not to remain here forever.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE GHOSTS APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR, AS BEFORE. SAME BREATHING — QUIETLY AT FIRST, BUT GROWING LOUDER. )\nMAX: Jeepers... Doctor, the ghosts. They’re here!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 56\nDOCTOR: Bang on schedule. But they’re not ghosts.\nMAX: What? Oh, yes. The ‘psychic projections’. Important to use the correct terminology!\nDOCTOR: No. Think about it. If this is supposed to be the afterlife... shouldn’t we be the ghosts?\nMAX: What’re you doing?\nDOCTOR: They took Nyssa away from here. I’m hoping they’1ll repeat the favour. (CALLS OUT) Hello there! Over here! I’m the Doctor... I was wondering if you could help me?\nMAX: (NERVOUS) Oh cripes.. oh bloomin’ cripes...\nDOCTOR: That’s right, you can hear me. Walk towards me... Nyssa, is that you? Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (VIA SPACESUIT) Doctor. You need to make direct physical contact —\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: (VIA SPACESUIT) Take my hand, Doctor. There isn’t much time.\nMAX: Doctor, I can’t let you do this —\nNYSSA: (VIA SPACESUIT) Now, Doctor, now.\nDOCTOR: Max! Ow! Get off me! What are you doing? Nyssa... the ghosts,\nDOCTOR: they’re fading — wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 57\nMAX: I’m sorry, Doctor. I don’t want to do this, but I haven’t got any choice.\nDOCTOR: What?\nMAX: If you go, Doctor, we'll die. All of us! We’1ll die! Don’t you\nMAX: get it? Everyone in this village should be dead. And if you leave, that’s what’s gonna happen!\nDOCTOR: Are you threatening me?\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE OTHERS ARE HERE, WALKING INTO THE SCENE. THEY ARE NO LONGER TALKING FLATLY — THEY’RE FRIENDLY, BUT TOO MUCH — SINISTER)\nDUDLEY: No, Doctor. You saw the gravestones. We are the dead.\nALICE: You have to be made to understand why you can never leave.\nDOCTOR: What?\nHAROLD: You are to pay your respects .. to the Lord and Lady of the Manor!\nHAROLD: 34. MANOR HOUSE\nHAROLD: This way, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Whoever this Lord and Lady are, I’m not keen on their interior decoration. Candles and cobwebs is so nineteenth century, don’t you think? Sort-of mock gothic! And if I were them, I’d sack my cleaner. This place must be inch-thick in dust.\nMAX: Um, I don’t think they’ve got a cleaner.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 58\nDOCTOR: That explains a great deal. You don’t have to do this, you know. Any of you!\nHAROLD: The Lord and Lady have granted us the gift of immortality.\nALICE: They absolve us of our regrets and our griefs.\nDUDLEY: And in return, they ask only for our obedience.\nDOCTOR: The gift of immortality? Can’t you see that it’s a curse, not a blessing?\nALICE: ‘Thy eternal summer shall not fade...\nDUDLEY: ‘nor lose possession of that fair thou owest.’\nJANE: ‘Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade.’\nHAROLD: ‘When in eternal lines to time thou growest.’\nALICE: ‘So long as men can breathe or eyes can see.’\nALICE: ALL VILLAGERS, AS ONE, REVERENTLY: ‘So long lives this... and this gives life to thee!’\nDOCTOR: You’re mad. All of you. Stark, staring bonkers!\nHAROLD: Yet I believe you will find there is a method in our madness...\nDUDLEY: Doctor. Allow me to present... the Lord and Lady of the Manor.\nDUDLEY: (FX: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. AND THEN THERE’S A VOICE. IT’S NYSSA, BUT WITH AN EFFECT ON THE VOICE — AGED, ALIEN, HUSKY, HOLLOW. )\nNYSSA: Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 59\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! What’s happened to you...?\nDUDLEY: This is the Lady Nyssa of Traken.\nDOCTOR: What? Your face... it’s like dust...\nNYSSA: I look different? So would you, if you had lived for over a hundred thousand years.\nDOCTOR: You’re the Lady of the Manor?\nDOCTOR: (FX: ANOTHER NEW ARRIVAL. THE DOCTOR WITH AN EFFECT ON HIS VOICE. )\nDOCTOR: (AS LORD) Yes, Doctor. And I am the Lord.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) The Lord Doctor...! Of course... a Time Lord.\nDOCTOR AND NYSSA: (AS LORD AND LADY, TOGETHER) We are the Lord and Lady of the Manor.\nDOCTOR: But you... you’re me. You’re me!\nDOCTOR: (AS LORD) Not quite, Doctor. To be precise, I am your future self. I am what you will become.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO CLIFFHANGER NOTE: FROM NOW ON, THE LORD DOCTOR AND LADY NYSSA WILL BE\nDOCTOR: REFERRED TO AS THE LORD AND LADY, TO DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 60"

Some sort of psychic transduction.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry?\nLIZZIE: Psychic transduction. Though that’s just something Geoff made up. I think he got it off the X-Files.\nNYSSA: You haven’t answered my question. Where am I?\nLIZZIE: Where do you think? Well’s Wood, of course!\nNYSSA: But it’s daylight. Broad daylight!

INSIDE MANOR\nLORD AND LADY: We are the Lord and Lady of the Manor.\nDOCTOR: But you... you’re me. You’re me!\nLORD: Not quite, Doctor. To be precise, I am your future self. I am what you will become.\nDOCTOR: You’re wrong. I will never become... whatever you are. Not ina (million) —\nLORD: A million years? Oh, it may take a while longer than that. But I am your destiny, Doctor. Your inescapable fate.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, I don’t believe in fate.\nLORD: Look at me. Look at this face. Scarred by the infinite ravages of time. Skin parched and crumbling to ash. Decomposing. Rotten. This face is your face.\nDOCTOR: Well, if that really is the case, then.. I should start using moisturiser.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 62\nLORD: Flippancy? Oh. A display of false self-confidence. I remember the affectation.\nLADY: Innkeeper. You and the others are to remain outside.\nDUDLEY: As you instruct, my Lady.\nDOCTOR: Of course! That’s what Max meant by ‘self-preservation’. That’s why you couldn’t let me to leave! Because if I don’t remain here, then one day I won’t become you!\nLORD: For you, it is yet to be. For us, it is distant past. It cannot — must not — be changed.\nDOCTOR: But it could be, couldn’t it? It’s still a physical possibility! That’s what you’re scared of — that I might do something which would cause you to cease to have ever existed!\nDOCTOR: 37. PIG BASE.\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARPAULIN PULLED ASIDE. AIR CONDITIONING WHIRRING.

Here, unfold one of those chairs... if you’d like a moment alone, (then) —\nNYSSA: I'd rather have answers.\nLIZZIE: Fair enough. Anything else you’d like, while I’m up? We can do you tea, coffee... and vegetable soup, for some reason. We normally have some biscuits, but they seem to have undergone an inexplicable disappearance. Probably fell into a freak wormhole — or big Nigel’s been in here again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 63\nNYSSA: A glass of water will suffice.\nLIZZIE: I’1ll make you a mug of tea, just in case. Now, exchange of information. Who are you?\nNYSSA: My name’s Nyssa. Who are you?\nLIZZIE: Lizzie. Elizabeth for long, Lizzie for short. Never Liz, hate the name. Surname?\nNYSSA: On my world we did not use inherited appellations. I am Nyssa, daughter of Tremas —\nLIZZIE: On your world?\nNYSSA: (BACKTRACKING) Jones. My name is Nyssa... Jones.\nLIZZIE: I see. Lizzie Corrigan. Miss.\nNYSSA: And what were you doing in the woods in those... spacesuits?\nLIZZIE: Environmental protection suits. It’s a long story. To cut it short, we’re the P I G.\nNYSSA: (LAUGHS) The ‘pig’?\nLIZZIE: Psychic investigation group.\nNYSSA: And what are you ‘investigating’?\nLIZZIE: A village that mysteriously vanished off the face of the planet sixty years ago. You may have heard of it. It’s called Stockbridge.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: 38. INSIDE MANOR\nDOCTOR: Supposing, for the sake of argument, you are my future self... what happens to me?\nLADY: You remain in Stockbridge forever.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? Forever’s an awfully long time...\nLORD: The Lady Nyssa and I have ruled over Stockbridge for countless millennia.\nLADY: We stopped keeping track after the first ten thousand centuries.\nDOCTOR: (WHISTLES) That long, eh? I’m surprised you still remember who you are!\nLORD: (REMEMBERING) I remember... I was a Lord, once. Of Time. I gave my name as ‘the Doctor’, but that wasn’t my real name. My real name was... it was...\nDOCTOR: (AMUSED, TEASING) You’ve forgotten!\nLORD: It has been so long since I have had cause to think of it. But I remember, before I came to Stockbridge. I had a home. ‘Gallverey’. Then I fled, to voyage across the gulfs of time. So many worlds I saw, so many lives I lived. Back... when I was you.\nDOCTOR: And the Lady Nyssa?\nLADY: I.. I know I was a Lady. Of Traken. My family died, my home world died. But it all feels like it happened in another life. Like.. a half-remembered childhood dream.\nDOCTOR: So you don’t remember Tegan? Or Adric? The Master? The Cybermen?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 65\nLADY: The words are unfamiliar. The time before the village... it all seems so distant now.\nDOCTOR: And what about this manor house of yours, hmmm?\nDOCTOR: (FX: A DOOR IS UNBOLTED AND OPENED. THEY MOVE INTO A NEW AREA. TRICKLING WATER. FLAGSTONES. A TRANQUIL, SUMMERY ATMOSPHERE. )\nLORD: Haven’t you guessed yet? Look, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, a conservatory. Very pleasant. Could do with a spot of pruning. What about it?\nLORD: This is the most ancient part of Stockbridge Manor. The first part to be built.\nLADY: The first part we constructed.\nDOCTOR: Constructed? You built this place between you?\nLADY: Over the millennia. Stone by stone.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m impressed at your workmanship, but I still don’t see...\nLORD: Look again, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What am I looking for? Vines... ivy.. moss, an ornamental fountain, statues and some sort of — oh my word. But that’s impossible... what are they doing here?\nLADY: Impossible?\nDOCTOR: Warp core engines! Or what’s left of them. But that means...\nLORD: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That means... the manor house. You’ve built it on the remains of the Rutan ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: 39. PIG BASE.\nLIZZIE: You don’t mind if I.., do you? (INHALES) Dreadful habit. So your gentlemen friend, this ‘Doctor’... he’s still in Stockbridge?\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: As far as I know.\nLIZZIE: And you don’t know how you ended up there?\nNYSSA: No. Now perhaps you could answer my questions?\nLIZZIE: Fire away.\nNYSSA: You said the village ‘mysteriously vanished’. What precisely do you mean?\nLIZZIE: One minute it was there, the next it... wasn’t. Happened sometime around the end of World War Two. It was all hushed-up, they Said it'd been destroyed by a V-2.\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: But it hadn’t?\nLIZZIE: If it had, you’d expect there to be a vast smoking crater, right? Witnesses? Survivors? Instead, there was nothing. It’s not just that the village wasn’t there. It was as if a big circle on the map had been cut away — and space had been folded in around it.\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: But that’s ridiculous!\nLIZZIE: Ridiculous or not, you’d walk towards the point on the map where Stockbridge should be... and pass straight through to the other side. The village hadn’t been blown up by a Jerry bomb. It had been reduced to a singularity.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: 40. INSIDE MANOR CONSERVATORY\nDOCTOR: The engines... they’re just as they were before. A little rusty, but essentially intact.\nLORD: 'Before...?’\nDOCTOR: Before the explosion... But they didn’t explode, did they? I’m beginning to understand. The warp core didn’t ignite... because I'd activated the fail-safe!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR There should be some sort of metabolic fail-safe, if only I can find...\nLADY: You saved the Earth from destruction, Doctor. In so doing, you created this place.\nDOCTOR: Of course! The engines would have been instantly enclosed within a stasis field. Allowing the pilot to make the necessary repairs... or retreat to a place of safety.\nLORD: Go on.\nDOCTOR: But rather than enclose just the engines, the bubble inflated! Expanding to take in the village, its inhabitants... and everything that’s happened here in the past sixty years!\nLADY: At last you comprehend.\nLORD: (MOCKING) So you see, it’s you, Doctor. You are the one who trapped us here for all eternity. It was all because of you!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: 41. PIG BASE\nNYSSA: So, if it was reduced to a singularity, how did you locate it?\nLIZZIE: It all kicked off about a year ago. People in the area reported seeing hallucinations. They’d catch sight of a village shimmering in the distance, as though it was made of mist. Only for a second, but it was there. Like Brigadoon.\nNYSSA: Like what?\nLIZZIE: ‘Brigadoon’. The old musical, you know? With Gene Kelly and Val Johnson.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry, I’m not familiar with the reference.\nLIZZIE: It’s not important. Anyway, soon it wasn’t just the village that people saw. About a month ago, they began to see the inhabitants too! That’s when the P I G received the summons. The manifestations tend to be concentrated around Well’s Wood, on the outskirts of where the village would’ve been — on the edge of the missing circle.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry — the ‘manifestations’?\nLIZZIE: We don’t like to call them ghosts. It’s a bit embarrassing.\nLIZZIE: 42. INSIDE MANOR\nDOCTOR: That’s what you’ve been doing? Ruling over Stockbridge? Tell me, what are the hours like? If I’m going to be taking over, I’d quite like to know what I’m letting myself in for.\nLORD: All shall become clear, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Deferring explanations... that’s a very annoying habit. I really must stop doing it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: DUDLEY & MAX: My Lord, my Lady.\nLADY: The stargazer.. and the Innkeeper. How considerate of you to wait.\nDUDLEY: I require absolution.\nMAX: And me, too... please.\nLADY: And you shall have it.\nDOCTOR: Absolution?\nLORD: The only way the villagers can endure.\nDOCTOR: Endure? I thought everyone in this village was ‘dearly departed’?\nLADY: The people of Stockbridge are held, forever, as they were at the instant of their death. Suspended in the moment. Dying and yet... undying.\nDOCTOR: So not so much an afterlife as a living death.\nLADY: The Innkeeper first, I think. I have an... appetite for his melancholy.\nLORD: Now, Doctor. Observe, how we endure...\nLADY: Innkeeper, give me your hand... so I might release you from the shackles of the past —\nLADY: (FX: DUDLEY SUDDENLY STARTS SCREAMING, GASPING. IN GREAT PAIN.

Delicious!! More! I must have more!\nJANE: The problem went away. And I know I should feel sad about it, but I don’t. I’m glad.\nDOCTOR: (DURING THE ABOVE) She’s feeding on his memories!\nLORD: Not his memories, Doctor. His past. Every experience, every emotion. Every delight and sorrow. Every love and every loss...\nDOCTOR: So that’s how you achieve sustenance. You’re parasites. Vampires! Forcing them to relive their lives, over and over again... just so that you have something to eat!\nLORD: The price we pay for immortality. Innkeeper, do you wish the Lady Nyssa to stop?\nDUDLEY: No. No. Please... I beg you, take it all... Please...\nLADY: Join me, my Lord. Satiate your hunger.

You don’t understand..—\nDOCTOR: Look at what they’re doing..! Do you really want to be the next course on the menu?\nMAX: You don’t know what it’s like. If you had to live through all the moments you’d rather forget... all the humiliation and heartbreak... you’d want someone to take it away too.\nDOCTOR: They’re not doing it for your benefit. To them you’re just a... source of nourishment! Come on, Max — run!\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS THEY RUN, THE LORD AND LADY CONTINUE TO FEED — AND WE GO INTO ANOTHER FLASHBACK — SOUNDING LIKE THE PREVIOUS FLASHBACKS. )\nDOCTOR: 43.

You didn’t really want it, you didn’t really want to marry me.\nDUDLEY: It’s not like that — I want to do the right thing.\nJANE: That’s just it. I don’t want you to be with me out of duty. Because you don’t really love me, Dudley and I don’t really love you. (BEAT) Our little problem didn’t go away.\nJANE: (FX: GRADUALLY WE NOTICE TWO OTHER VOICES, ECHOING EACH LINE.

Don’t be angry. You can walk away now. Do what you do best. Walk away.\nDOCTOR WHO: DUDLEY & LORD: You don’t understand, I love you —\nDOCTOR WHO: JANE & LADY: Please, just leave me alone, I don’t want to see you any more...\nDOCTOR WHO: DUDLEY & LORD: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: JANE & LADY: Let go, you’re hurting me —\nDUDLEY: One minute she was standing there, the next the edge just gave way — )\nLADY: Oh, such exquisite remorse! Such delectable agony!\nLORD: Now, Stargazer. It is your turn. Stargazer...?\nLADY: He has gone... They have both gone!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: 44. PIG BASE\nNYSSA: So as far as you were concerned, I was one of these ghosts?\nLIZZIE: Until we made physical contact... Another cup of tea? No? — But when we saw you, your presence was much more.. corporeal than any of the previous manifestations.\nNYSSA: That’s what Max said about you.\nLIZZIE: What?\nNYSSA: That the ghosts were becoming more solid with each passing day.\nLIZZIE: The link does seem to be getting stronger. It’s as if the village is slowly breaking through into our reality. That’s Geoff's theory, anyway. I think he got it off Buffy.\nNYSSA: (CONSIDERING) Or maybe whatever caused Stockbridge to disappear in the first place is growing weaker.\nLIZZIE: Wait a tic — did you say each passing day?\nNYSSA: Yes. Max said the ghosts appeared at the same place, at the same time, every night —\nLIZZIE: But the manifestations aren’t every day. They’re every couple of hours!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: 45. INSIDE MANOR\nLADY: Awake, innkeeper. Awake!\nDUDLEY: (WAKING) I... thank you, My Lady. No more regret... no more guilt...\nLORD: Your gratitude can wait. The Doctor and the stargazer have... absconded.\nDUDLEY: Doctor Smith? Max — ?\nLADY: The Doctor must be located. Instruct the villagers to search the grounds. At once!\nLORD: And as for the stargazer.. his continued existence is no longer to be tolerated.\nLORD: 46. PIG BASE\nNYSSA: But that explains it.. why each day in the village felt like only a few hours...\nLIZZIE: Because each day was only a few hours.\nNYSSA: So these ghosts — manifestations — appear every hour or so?\nLIZZIE: That’s right. As you can see from the wall chart — every one hour fifteen minutes, at present. The rate’s increasing, each time generating a larger psychic disturbance.\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: You can detect psychic disturbances?\nLIZZIE: We’d hardly be the Psychic Investigation Group if we couldn’t. We have a (box of)-\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 75\nLIZZIE: Hello, yeah? Geoffrey? .. What? Alright, alright, hold your horses, I’m on my way.\nNYSSA: What is it?\nLIZZIE: Another P.S.I. surge. The biggest one yet. Come on, ‘Nyssa’ — we’ve got work to do.\nLIZZIE: 47. INSIDE MANOR CONSERVATORY\nLIZZIE: (FX: FOUNTAIN TRICKLES. A DOOR IS UNBOLTED AND FLUNG OPEN. DOCTOR AND MAX RUSH IN.)\nDOCTOR: Quick, Max, through here. Quick!\nMAX: Oh blimey, my knees, my poor knees. (BEAT) We’re not leaving the manor?\nDOCTOR: No. That’s exactly what they’d expect us to do. Instead I wanted another look at this.\nMAX: What is it? Some sort of avant-garde sculpture?\nDOCTOR: It’s what’s left of a hyperspatial warp core engine.\nMAX: A what?\nDOCTOR: Alien technology, far in advance of your own.\nMAX: Oh, right. Actually, now you mention it, I thought it looked a bit Venusian.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Max. Now, to sustain a four-dimensional bubble would require huge reserves of power... if I can divert some of that power into the synaptic feed...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 76\nMAX: Hey, look, that bit lit up! Fairy lights!\nDOCTOR: Eureka! That’s the cardio-electric capacitor.. it indicates how — (REALISES) Oh dear.\nMAX: Bad news?\nDOCTOR: Extremely. Max, the reason why you’ve started seeing ghosts in Wells Wood... and why the days have been getting shorter... is because the time bubble’s collapsing.\nMAX: Oh. (BEAT) What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: Its structural integrity is breaking down. At first, allowing you a glimpse of the outside world. Then, becoming thin enough for someone to pass through. But ultimately...\nMAX: Ultimately?\nDOCTOR: What happens to all bubbles in the end? Pop!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: 48. WELL’S WOOD\nLIZZIE: Don’t just stand there gawping like a narna, move! (HALTS) Here we go, Wells Wood.\nLIZZIE: (FX: THEY GET OUT. MACHINERY THROBBING. POWER CABLES. P.I.G. CHAT. )\nNYSSA: What are you attempting to do with all this... ‘equipment’?\nLIZZIE: Ah, well, it’s pretty complicated, I’m not sure you'd understand —\nNYSSA: I think you’ll find I am more than capable of understanding anything you consider to be ‘complicated’.\nLIZZIE: Alright, no need to get your knickers in a palaver. That box of tricks there, the one that looks like a big colander, is what we call a psychic amplifier.\nNYSSA: It’s what you used to enter Stockbridge?\nLIZZIE: Yes. Well guessed! This whole area’s basically a hotspot for psychic activity, a side-effect we’re guessing. By focusing that residual background energy, whenever there’s a manifestation... we can create a doorway, a sort of dimensional aperture.\nNYSSA: Like forcing a lever into a fault line.\nLIZZIE: You're the first person we’ve managed to pull through. You were lucky — the interface can be jolly unstable. Hazardous. That’s why we need to suit up.\nNYSSA: You say it utilises psychic energy — you mean the power of thought?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 78\nLIZZIE: I know, I know, you have every right to be sceptical. But it’s not mumbo-jumbo, it’s all scientific fact. Ever since it was discovered in the nineteenth century, the existence of psychic energy has been an official secret.\nNYSSA: It’s not that I doubt the science — I’ve seen similar technology before — I’m just wondering whether it might also be used to communicate.\nLIZZIE: I’m sorry?\nNYSSA: A psychic amplifier may also be used to boost an individual's latent psychic abilities.\nLIZZIE: What, like telepathy?\nNYSSA: To put it in terms you are capable of understanding, yes. We might be able to make contact with the Doctor!\nLIZZIE: And do you happen to know of anyone with latent psychic abilities?\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: Of course. Me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: 49. MANOR HOUSE CONSERVATORY\nDOCTOR: What do I have to do to make you work, you stupid (thing)...\nDOCTOR: Ha! The old targeted-impact trick, never fails.\nMAX: Hey, that’s a hologram... of the village!\nDOCTOR: Yes. You can see, how it’s contained within the bubble. Rather like a snow globe.\nMAX: Oh look, I can see my house! There’s even smoke coming out of the chimney!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Max.\nMAX: Doctor, what you said before, about the bubble going pop... what’1ll happen to us?\nDOCTOR: This whole place will cease to exist. Everyone here will die. Permanently.\nMAX: Oh lumme. (BEAT) How long do we have?\nDOCTOR: Hard to say. The rate of deflation is gradual at the moment, but if it accelerates... then this ‘eternal summer’ of yours won’t be ‘eternal’ for very much longer.\nMAX: Hey, what’s that wibbly thing?\nDOCTOR: What — (OH NO) A breach in the time bubble’s surface...\nMAX: A hole?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 80\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Somebody’s attempting to puncture the stasis field!\nMAX: Puncture? Like sticking a drawing pin in a balloon?\nDOCTOR: Precisely that sort of puncture. Interesting — the breach is located in... Well’s Wood!\nMAX: Where the ghosts in spacesuits are!\nDOCTOR: Where the psychic projections are, yes. They must be the ones behind it.\nMAX: Doctor, don’t want to worry you, but should it be getting dark outside?\nDOCTOR: Events are speeding up. Come on, Max, time we made a move.\nMAX: Where?\nDOCTOR: To Well’s Wood, of course.\nMAX: What? To meet whoever’s trying to force their way in?\nDOCTOR: More than that. We have to stop them!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: 50. INSIDE MANOR\nLADY: My Lord. The atmosphere of the village is shifting... changing... like there’s a thunderstorm approaching.\nLORD: I sense it too. A chill breeze, rustling through the night.\nLADY: The surging onrush of time, bringing destruction upon the village.\nLORD: The eternal summer is over. Autumn is approaching...\nLADY: It will be the end of us. We cannot endure without the stasis field.\nLORD: Then we have no choice... we must beg the assistance of our\nLORD: saviour...\nLORD: LORD & LADY: Viridios!\nLORD: 51. WELLS’ WOOD\nNYSSA: Ready to engage power?\nLIZZIE: This isn’t going to work, Nyssa. I’ll give you ten to one odds, it’ll fry your brain.\nNYSSA: We have to try. Now!\nLIZZIE: Switching on. Fingers crossed!\nNYSSA: (IN PAIN) No... no...\nLIZZIE: Okay, I’m switching (off) —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 82\nNYSSA: (IN PAIN) No, wait! Wait. I can see... I can the village green. The trees. The church. And a blue Police Box... and the Doctor and Max.. and a telephone, ringing...\nNYSSA: Doctor. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? If you can hear me...\nNYSSA: go to the woods tonight. Where I was taken. I’m coming back for you. I’ll show you the way through. Go to the woods, tonight —\nLIZZIE: Oh my goodness... Nyssa? Are you alright?\nNYSSA: I’m fine, but... there... there was something else...\nLIZZIE: Something else?\nNYSSA: Something alive. but incredibly ancient... and cold, so terribly cold. It felt like.. a living shadow..! I could hear its voice in my mind... and there was a word. A name!\nLIZZIE: A name?\nLIZZIE: NYSSA3: .Viridios.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 83\nDOCTOR WHO: 52. VILLAGE GREEN\nMAX: Doctor... the sky... storm clouds! There’ve never been storm clouds over Stockbridge! Not since.. well, not since for as long as I can remember!\nDOCTOR: The collapse is accelerating! Come on, Max, we have to (get) —\nHAROLD: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Harold, Alice —\nALICE: What is it you ‘have’ to do?\nMAX: Out of our way. Please, Mr Withers...\nHAROLD: You never were part of Stockbridge, were you, Max? Never really fitted in.\nMAX: Shut up, you rotten —\nDUDLEY: The laughing stock of the village! Always gawping at the stars and chasing phantoms!\nMAX: I said.. shut up —\nALICE: So lonely and pathetic. You never did find someone who could bear to be with you... But who would want to spend the rest of their life with an obese, ugly failure like you?\nMAX: Leave me alone!\nDUDLEY: The Lord and Lady have decreed you are no longer to be granted the gift of life...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ETERNAL SUMMER by Jonathan Morris (002) Page 84\nDOCTOR: Max, ignore them.

Turn it off, the moment that Nyssa and I depart, could you?\nLIZZIE: Depart?\nNYSSA: We’re returning to Stockbridge.\nMAX: But then, how will you get back?\nDOCTOR: I’1ll worry about that. The second we leave, you are not to activate this machine again. Max, can I trust you do that?\nMAX: You don’t want me to come with you?\nMAX: NYSSA3: You’d be safer here.\nMAX: But I want to help.\nDOCTOR: The most helpful thing you can do is to keep out of the way.\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s right. It could be very dangerous.\nMAX: But —\nLIZZIE: It’s alright, Doctor. I'll keep an eye on him.
