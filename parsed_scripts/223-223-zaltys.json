Avoid those with the burning eyes and the thirst-’\nTEGAN: What are you reading?\nADRIC: On my planet, Tegan, it’s considered very rude to just walk into somebody’s room without asking permission.\nTEGAN: Funny how you care so much about good manners when it inconveniences you. What’s the book?\nADRIC: Dracoola.\nTEGAN: It’s pronounced Dracula. Didn’t have you down as a horror fan, Adric — I thought you’d have your nose in a maths book.\nADRIC: I’ve read all the ones in the TARDIS library. And I thought this might be useful.\nTEGAN: It’s just a story, how could it possibly be useful?\nADRIC: It seems to me, it’s best to be prepared in case we run into any more vampires.\nTEGAN: ‘Any more?’\nADRIC: Mm. We met three of them in E-Space, and the Doctor tells me there are vampire legends on almost every inhabited planet in this Universe — the Reavers of Actinon [acty-non], the NASA experiments of the 1970s, the fabled lost spaceship—\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 3\nTEGAN: You think I can’t tell when you’re having me on.\nADRIC: I am definitely not ‘having you on’. I don’t think. Is that an Australian thing?\nTEGAN: It’s an Earth thing. It means you’re pulling my leg.\nADRIC: And ‘pulling your leg’ means...?\nTEGAN: I’m not going to teach you the meanings of words and phrases, Adric, you already speak English.\nADRIC: No, you speak Alzarian. What do you want, Tegan? I’m very busy.\nTEGAN: That’s a laugh. I’ve never seen anyone so bored in their life. That’s the trouble with clever-clogs like you — you can’t stop fidgeting.\nADRIC: What part of that sentence am I supposed to understand?\nTEGAN: Look, I’ve given up on the Doctor. He’s always promising to take me back to Heathrow, and we never get there!\nADRIC: I can’t understand why you’re so keen to get back to vessels that can only go up and down, when you’re on a craft that can travel through the entire infinity of the universe.\nTEGAN: Well, that’s only one of the differences between me and you. The other is that you know how to fly the TARDIS.\nADRIC: Me?\nTEGAN: You took it to Castrovalva, didn’t you?\nADRIC: In a manner of speaking. I wasn’t exactly myself at the time.\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 4\nTEGAN: Well, you are now. The Master’s dead, the Doctor’s off making repairs to who-knows-what — now’s the chance to show off your skills.\nADRIC: It would be nice to show that I can pilot the TARDIS when I’m not under anyone else’s control. I’ve already done plenty of simulations.\nTEGAN: Yeah, don’t remind me of anything that might make me change my mind. Just get me to the right place in the right year.\nADRIC: Heathrow, 1981?\nTEGAN: Do you reckon you can do it?\nADRIC: Of course I can do it! But the Doctor would be furious with me!\nTEGAN: He’s always furious with you.\nADRIC: He didn’t used to be. Things were different when-\nTEGAN: When it was just you and him? Well, get me home, and there’11l be one less of us. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?\nADRIC: You’re sure the Doctor’s not in the control room?\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 5\nADRIC: SCENE 2: INT. TARDIS — CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: Two to the right. That’s the one.\nNYSSA: So how do you get to the circuits?\nDOCTOR: (PUSHING ROUNDEL) Just put some pressure on the centre of the roundel, then (TWISTING ROUNDEL) .. give it a good twist to the\nDOCTOR: left! (LIFTING OFF ROUNDEL) There! Could you take that for me?\nNYSSA: Where...?\nDOCTOR: Just leave it by your feet for now.\nDOCTOR: You know, I’ve been meaning to get around to these repairs for centuries. That’s the problem with time travel, Nyssa — there’s always a fresh distraction. Some day, I’d like to park the TARDIS in the vortex for a decade or so, get a few odd jobs done, then catch up on my reading. I hear very good things about Christopher Marlowe. And P.G. Wodehouse.\nNYSSA: So once these circuits are fixed, we’ll have the Zero Room back?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’1ll grow back on its own eventually, but the process would be a lot more reliable if the TARDIS had a proper stabiliser. I was warned about it when I first, er, procured her.\nNYSSA: By “procured”, you mean “stole”.\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. If I hadn’t have taken her, she might have been consigned to some pocket dimension, left to waste away. Terrible the way Gallifreyan society treats its old age pensioners. But there’s plenty of life left in the old girl yet.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 6\nNYSSA: Yesterday, you called her a “flying deathtrap”.\nDOCTOR: Well, that was yesterday, and I can say with certainty that that was the very last control room fire.\nNYSSA: Absolute certainty?\nDOCTOR: Relative certainty. Actually, the entire console could do with an overhaul, but that’s for another day. One repair at a time. Speaking of which: hand me the ion bonder, would you?\nNYSSA: The ion bonder?\nDOCTOR: Yes, come on, come on.\nNYSSA: I don’t have it.\nDOCTOR: Oh!\nNYSSA: I gave it to you, Doctor. Remember, when the console was on fire? You said you needed it to disable the chrono-compensator.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, I did say that, didn’t I?\nDOCTOR: Well, I certainly don’t have it now. I wonder what I did with it?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: What’s this?\nADRIC: What’s what?\nTEGAN: (PICKS UP DEVICE) This. It was lying on the console.\nADRIC: An ion bonder. The Doctor will need it if he’s repairing the internal dimension stabiliser.\nADRIC: Look, perhaps we should do this another time — when we’re more likely to have the control room to ourselves.\nTEGAN: Don’t chicken out now, Adric. I thought you could do this. — Maybe your sums aren’t as good as you make out. What did you really get that badge for?\nADRIC: Mathematical excellence!\nTEGAN: I haven’t seen much excellence. The Alzarian curriculum must be a lot easier than the human one.\nADRIC: Earth, England, 1981, in the time you call Anno Domini.\nTEGAN: Heathrow, don’t forget Heathrow.\nADRIC: Heathrow. Tegan, you know if you go back, there’1ll be a lot of people asking questions about what happened to your Aunt.\nTEGAN: You honestly think that’s a good reason for not going back? Is that what you’d do in my position?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 8\nADRIC: Well, I’m not in your position, am I? I lost a family member, too, but I can’t go back home. Neither can Nyssa.\nTEGAN: Well, I still have that option, and I want to exercise it. Are we on our way yet?\nADRIC: Not yet. It’s not as simple as it looks.\nTEGAN: I hope the same’s true of you.\nADRIC: I’ve almost got it. The Doctor’s not a believer in pinpoint accuracy. But I think, if you take the time, you [can-]\nTEGAN: Tell me that means you did everything right, I dare you.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 9\nTEGAN: SCENE 4: INT. TARDIS — CORRIDORS\nDOCTOR: There used to be a meadow inside the TARDIS — there might still be, for all I know. It’d be a lovely spot for a few practice innings, cucumber sandwiches and a refreshing glass of ginger beer afterwards.\nNYSSA: Assuming it didn’t get jettisoned along with the Zero Room.\nDOCTOR: Yes, assuming that.\nNYSSA: We were fortunate not to be shot into the vortex, too.\nDOCTOR: Well, I believe there’s a fail-safe designed to prevent that from happening. It just it doesn’t appear to be working at the moment.\nNYSSA: Another repair to add to the list.\nDOCTOR: At least the state of temporal grace is still functionin—\nDOCTOR: A NEEDLE ON A RECORD.\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Nothing good! The control room, come on!\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: SCENE 5: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: WITH THE ALARM.\nADRIC: What’s happening?\nTEGAN: That’s what I want to know! Are we going to explode?\nADRIC: Impossible! The TARDIS is indestructible! I think. (REACHES OUT — THEN CRIES OUT IN PAIN AS HE TOUCHES CONSOLE)\nTEGAN: Can’t you do something? Don’t just stand there!\nADRIC: That’s all I can do! I’m stuck to the console!\nDOCTOR: This is just what I was afraid of!\nNYSSA: Adric!\nADRIC: Doctor, help me!\nDOCTOR: Get away from the console!\nADRIC: I can’t!\nDOCTOR: You don’t know how to fly the TARDIS, and I do! Now don’t just stand there!\nTEGAN: That’s all he can do, Doctor! He’s stuck fast to the console.\nADRIC: Doctor, help me!\nNYSSA: Tegan, give me a hand!\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 11\nADRIC: No, don’t touch me!\nDOCTOR: He’s right! Whatever it is, it could affect you, too.\nADRIC: (FX) I don’t know what went wrong! I was just trying to take\nADRIC: the TARDIS to Earth.\nTEGAN: Look at him! He’s glowing!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 12\nTEGAN: SCENE 6: INT. EXEMPLAR — BRIDGE\nTEGAN: THE TARDIS.\nCLARIMONDE: Your signal is breaking up! Your signal is breaking up! Say again — is all prepared?\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 13\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 7: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nCLARIMONDE: VOICE PERSIST.\nADRIC: (FX) Prepared for what? Who’s saying that?\nTEGAN: Nobody said anything. What’s he talking about?\nDOCTOR: I think the TARDIS is under some sort of psychic attack.\nNYSSA: Is that possible?\nDOCTOR: Ordinarily, I would say not. But it appears to be happening, so, yes. Adric, everything’s going to be all right. Just trust me. You trust me, don’t you?\nADRIC: (FX) I don’t know what you mean. I’ve never heard of Zaltys!\nNYSSA: He can’t hear you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Makes a change from just not listening. If we can get one of the panels off the base of the console, I might be able to... (STRAINS AS HE PULLS THE PANEL) .. do something.\nDOCTOR: There!\nTEGAN: Adric’s still glowing.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Tegan, that’s extremely helpful. Ah, here’s the trouble — someone deactivated the chrono-compensator. Schoolboy error.\nTEGAN: You don’t need this, by any chance?\nNYSSA: The ion bonder! So that’s where it got to!\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter, I need to do this manually.\nADRIC: (FX) Doctor? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Nearly done, Adric.\nTEGAN: He’s disappearing! Hurry, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: The best I can do is the best I can do, Tegan!\nDOCTOR: (EMERGING FROM UNDER CONSOLE) There! A bit rough and ready, but it’ll do for the moment. Yet another repair to add to the list.\nNYSSA: Doctor... you were too late.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTEGAN: He’s gone. Adric’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nNYSSA: Is Adric dead?\nDOCTOR: (UNSURE) I— (DETERMINED) No. No, not if I have anything to say about it. It should be possible to trace the attack back to its source.\nTEGAN: You think someone kidnapped him?\nDOCTOR: I think someone wanted the pilot of a TARDIS. Adric just happened to be at the controls.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 15\nTEGAN: You don’t know that for certain.\nDOCTOR: No, Tegan, I don’t! And if I don’t do this now, we’1ll never know! But if you’re intent on looking on the dark side, then consider this: what will Adric’s abductors do once they realise he doesn’t know a thing about the practicalities of time travel?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nADRIC: Doctor? Nyssa? Anyone here? Where is here?\nADRIC: Not anywhere on the TARDIS — this is all grey metal and walkways. I’m lost. Typical! This is Tegan’s fault. She loves to get me into trouble!\nADRIC: Hello? Can anyone hear me?\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 17\nADRIC: SCENE 9: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nNYSSA: Adric said something about ‘Zaltys’. Could that be a place or a person?\nDOCTOR: A planet, I think. The name rings a bell, but I don’t believe I’ve been there. Or if I have, then not recently. Not a particularly hospitable place, I think.\nTEGAN: Then that must be where Adric is!\nNYSSA: That’s where he might be. But even then, we don’t know the exact date or location.\nTEGAN: (SARCASM) Great. So what do we do? Trust to luck?\nDOCTOR: It’s just possible I can fix the exact source of the incursion by using the TARDIS’ telepathic circuits. Tegan, I need absolute silence.\nTEGAN: Why, is it dangerous?\nDOCTOR: No, I just always appreciate it when you’re quiet.\nDOCTOR: Now, then...\nDOCTOR: SPACE EPISODE 6).\nTEGAN: (WHISPERS) I’m not sure he knows what he’s doing.\nNYSSA: (WHISPERS) I wish I could say for certain either way. I know very little about telep— (MENTAL TWINGE) Ow!\nTEGAN: (WHISPERS) Nyssa, what’s wrong?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 18\nNYSSA: (WHISPERS) It’s nothing, just a headache. We mustn’t distract the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Almost got it! I think.\nTEGAN: Have you found him?\nDOCTOR: Well, I won’t know until I actually find him, will I?\nDOCTOR: AS ON ADRIC’S EARLIER.\nTEGAN: (FX) You don’t have to be so— What’s happening to me?\nNYSSA: Tegan!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I definitely haven’t forgotten about you, Tegan. You were the one who persuaded Adric to fly the TARDIS, weren’t you? Why can’t you trust me to— Tegan? Where’s she got to now?\nNYSSA: She’s vanished, too. Just like Adric.\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 19\nNYSSA: SCENE 10: INT. EXEMPLAR — CELL\nTEGAN: (SHOCK OF FINDING HERSELF SOMEWHERE NEW) Ah! Where the..? — Can’t see where I am, it’s too dark. (CALLING OUT) Hello? Is anybody there? Doctor? Can anybody hear [me?]\nTEGAN: (STARTLED) Whoa! What was that?\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER SPEAKER) A barrier just came down.\nTEGAN: A barrier? Why?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Simply a precautionary measure. Would you mind taking two steps to the left?\nTEGAN: What?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Two steps. To your left. Please.\nTEGAN: (SHOCK) Ahh!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Thank you. Forgive me, I simply wanted you on the right Side of the barrier.\nTEGAN: Right for who — you or me?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) You simply appeared here without warning. In my position, would you act any differently?\nTEGAN: Maybe not. Look, where are you? Why can’t I see you?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) What can you see?\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 20\nTEGAN: Nothing. I can’t see anything. So turn the lights on, why don’t you?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I don’t need light to see you.\nTEGAN: How convenient for you. — You’re not even in the same room as me, are you?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I’m.. elsewhere.\nTEGAN: I’ve had enough of this. (GROPING AROUND, FEELING WALLS) How do I get out of here...?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Through the door, of course.\nTEGAN: (DETERMINED) Right!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) But it’ll remain locked, until we’ve determined whether or not you pose any kind of threat to us.\nTEGAN: Why would you think I’m a threat? I don’t even know who you are.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) You mentioned the Doctor.\nTEGAN: No, I didn't. I just called out 'Doctor'. Look, who are you?\nCLARIMONDE: Tell me about him.\nTEGAN: How do you know the Doctor?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I’m asking you.\nTEGAN: This is starting to sound less like a precautionary measure, more like an interrogation.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 21\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I promise you that after you’ve answered my questions, I’1l unlock the door for you.\nTEGAN: Tell me where the door is first!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Before you arrived here, you were on the TARDIS?\nTEGAN: So you do know the Doctor!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) And we know you, too. Is the TARDIS coming here?\nTEGAN: Too right it is! And that’s the last question I’m answering until you let me out of here.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Then we have nothing more to talk about for the present.\nTEGAN: Where’d you go? Hey! What have you done with Adric?\nTEGAN: Let me out of here!\nTEGAN: I said, let me out!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 22\nTEGAN: SCENE 11: EXT. ZALTYS SHORELINE\nTEGAN: ONTO PEBBLY SHORE. WATER LAPS AGAINST IT.\nDOCTOR: . Now, if either Adric or Tegan had been carrying a homing crystal, I might have been able to reverse-engineer its functions.\nNYSSA: Unfortunately, neither of them had that foresight.\nDOCTOR: No. What do you think of our destination?\nNYSSA: An orange beach under a purple sky — it’s making my eyes hurt.\nDOCTOR: It is rather garish. There are sunglasses in the TARDIS, if you want me to fetch you a pair?\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. We need to start looking for Adric and Tegan.\nDOCTOR: Fair enough.\nNYSSA: Could this be Zaltys?\nDOCTOR: Possibly, although it does seem to match the descriptions I’ve been given of Thoros Beta. Which probably explains why I’ve avoided Thoros Beta so far.\nNYSSA: Please tell me we don’t have an entire planet to search.\nDOCTOR: I’d hate to think Tegan’s pessimism is rubbing off on you, Nyssa. And while I can’t promise pin-point accuracy, I’m at least satisfied that we’re within a few miles of the source of the psychic attack. We might even find them with a telescope. Just give me a moment to pop back inside and get it. (TURNING BACK) I’1l grab the sunglasses while I’m [at it.]\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 23\nNYSSA: Doctor, look! There’s something in the water!\nDOCTOR: Yes.. And it seems to be surfacing. Get behind me, Nyssa. I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but the last time something like this happened to me, it turned out to be—\nNYSSA: A woman!\nDOCTOR: Ah. In that case, never mind.\nDOCTOR: Hello, there. We come in peace. Er, can you hear me through that... apparatus?\nSABLE: (MUFFLED BENEATH HER HELMET) Is there any trace of contaminants?\nDOCTOR: Just had a check-up, as a matter of fact. Fighting fit.\nSABLE: (MUFFLED) I wasn’t talking to you.\nSHAUN: (D; FAINT, OVER SABLE’S RADIO) Atmosphere’s clean. You could eat your dinner off it.\nSABLE: (MUFFLED) Thanks, Shaun. That’s all I wanted to know.\nSABLE: Hi.\nNYSSA: Hello.\nSABLE: I'm Sable, the fellow on the other end of the line is Shaun.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: In that case, hello, Sable. And hello, Shaun, if you can hear me.\nSABLE: You two have names, I’m guessing.\nDOCTOR: Of course. This is Nyssa of Traken, and I’m the Doctor.\nSABLE: That’s not a name, it’s a title. I asked for your name.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it escapes me for the moment.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12: INT. SABLE AND SHAUN’S SHIP (CONTINUOUS)\nSHAUN: I can’t work out if he’s sincere or if he’s trying to be funny.\nSABLE: (D; OVER RADIO) You should see him in person. I never met anyone who wore vegetables like they were bling before.\nDOCTOR: (D) Forgive me for asking, Sable, but are you a native of this world?\nNYSSA: (D) Whichever world that happens to be.\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 25\nNYSSA: SCENE 13: EXT. ZALTYS SHORELINE (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: It’s just that your hair is such a vivid shade of pink it seems suited to our surroundings.\nSABLE: What, you don’t know where you are?\nNYSSA: No, but we have our suspicions.\nSABLE: This is Zaltys. They call it the planet of the dead.\nDOCTOR: Do they? That’s funny, I’ve visited at least half a dozen planets of the dead. Whoever ‘they’ are, they don’t have much imagination when it comes to appellations.\nSABLE: All right, I call it the planet of the dead.\nDOCTOR: You never know, it might catch on.\nNYSSA: Where is everyone, Sable?\nSABLE: Well, that’s the question, isn’t it? Where’d they all go?\nSHAUN: (D) You’re not seeing any signs of life, then?\nSABLE: Only these two, Shaun, and they don’t seem to be locals. Even if one person buried everyone else, there’d be nobody left to bury him.\nDOCTOR: I take it you weren’t expecting to find anyone. Or anyone alive.\nSABLE: Let’s put it this way — I wasn’t expecting you.\nSHAUN: (D) You know what I think.\nSABLE: I do know what you think.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: What who thinks? Shaun?\nSABLE: Shaun thinks you’re competitors.\nNYSSA: I promise you we’re not. We don’t even know what it is we’re supposed to be competing for.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. If it’s anything to do with hair couture, we cheerfully admit defeat.\nSABLE: You're after the treasures of Zaltys.\nDOCTOR: Far from it. In fact, until you mentioned them, we weren’t aware Zaltys had any treasures.\nNYSSA: We’re looking for our friends — a woman and a boy.\nDOCTOR: You haven’t seen them, I suppose?\nSABLE: They’re not under the water, if that’s what you mean. That’s just where my ship’s parked.\nSHAUN: (D) Our ship.\nSABLE: Our ship. Best to try and keep a low profile.\nNYSSA: Even when you’re not expecting to find anyone.\nSABLE: I found you, didn’t I?\nDOCTOR: She does have a point, Nyssa. Discretion is the better part of— Well, it’s the better part of a great many things, actually. But you seem to have your quest, and we have ours, so if you should happen to bump into our friends, would you mind pointing them in this direction?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 27\nSABLE: Or we could search together.\nDOCTOR: That’s a generous offer, Sable, but I’m not sure our goals are necessarily compatible.\nSABLE: What if I insisted?\nDOCTOR: It’s possible to insist without drawing a gun on us, you know.\nSABLE: Not in my neighbourhood. I don’t mistrust you, but I don’t exactly trust you either, so while I’m on Zaltys, I’m gonna be a lot happier if I know where you are.\nNYSSA: Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well... Why not? Six eyes are better than four, I always say.\nNYSSA: When do you ever say that?\nDOCTOR: Helped break the ice with a couple of Silurians once. Anyway, let’s just do as the nice lady with the weapon asks. Lead the way, Sable.\nSABLE: Just follow the direction of the barrel.\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: SCENE 14: INT. EXEMPLAR — CELL\nTEGAN: Hey, you still there? I’m still here, in case you were wondering. Of course, you’re not wondering, because you locked me in. My eyes are adjusting to the dark a bit. Enough to have found that door you mentioned, so I’1l be going now..? Just say the word if you don’t want me to leave. (NO REPLY; TO SELF) Right then, time to find out what an “ion bonder” does. I just hope I’m pointing it in the right direction...\nTEGAN: Aah!\nTEGAN: Done it! Now to find out where I an...\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 29\nTEGAN: SCENE 15: INT. EXEMPLAR — CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)\nTEGAN: FLOORING.\nTEGAN: The Doctor had better be around here somewhere. If he’s not looking for me, I’1ll be furious.\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER SPEAKER) From what I’ve heard of the Doctor, he’s unlikely to leave you to your own devices for long, Miss Grant.\nTEGAN: Still there, are you? I thought I’d heard the back of you.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) You don’t mind if I use our cameras to keep an eye on you?\nTEGAN: Ouch! Rabbits!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Watch your step, Miss Grant.\nTEGAN: I could do that if you’d just turn some lights on. And stop calling me Miss Grant!\nCLARMONDE: (D) I beg your pardon. Do you prefer “Josephine” or simply a“ Jo” ?\nTEGAN: I don’t prefer any of them because I’m not a Jo or a Josephine! My name’s Tegan Jovanka.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I see.\nTEGAN: Wish I could.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I did think you weren’t a particularly close match for the\nCLARIMONDE: description. Taller...\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 30\nTEGAN: Ow!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) .. Slightly more co-ordinated. When my people first encountered the Doctor, he travelled with a human female. Forgive me for jumping to conclusions.\nTEGAN: I’ll forgive you anything if you just send me back where I came from.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I’m afraid that’s quite impossible, Tegan. Apparently, you arrived here quite by accident. Sending you back would undoubtedly please the Doctor — which I’m not in the business of doing.\nTEGAN: You seem to think you’re his arch-enemy. Not called Zodin, are you?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) My name is Clarimonde.\nTEGAN: Nope, he’s never mentioned you. Maybe you’re not as important as you reckon.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) We’ve not actually met. Those of my kind who encounter the Doctor tend not to live too long. So you’1l understand when I say that any friend of his is a foe of mine.\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 31\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 16: EXT. ZALTYS FIELDS\nSABLE: Seven months ago, all communications and signals from Zaltys just ceased.\nNYSSA: Has the cause been ascertained?\nSABLE: No, but the natives were never the most sociable of people. You could count the number of them who’ve ever been off-planet on the fingers of one leg.\nDOCTOR: Now I come to think of it, I do seem to recall hearing something about an isolationist stance. But you’re not here because you’re concerned that next door haven’t been putting their empties out.\nSABLE: Once it was clear there was no getting through to anyone, the whole of Zaltys was placed under quarantine.\nDOCTOR: Quarantine? — Ah. The possibility of plague, perhaps. I see why people might jump to that conclusion.\nNYSSA: Except for the distinct absence of bodies.\nDOCTOR: Some sort of tissue-eating bacteria, then? I saw something very Similar on Draconia two or three centuries ago.\nNYSSA: Then why aren’t we affected?\nSABLE: Obviously, because there is no plague. Didn’t you hear Shaun say he hadn’t detected any contaminants?\nDOCTOR: Only after you’d come to the surface. Which indicates a rather cavalier attitude, if I might say so.\nSABLE: We couldn’t be sure until we’d breached the blockade and entered the atmosphere.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 32\nNYSSA: That still doesn’t explain what happened to the people of Zaltys.\nSABLE: Nyssa, was it? I’ve got to be honest with you, Nyssa, I’m not really interested in what happened to them. They’re either dead or they’re gone, either option is fine by me.\nDOCTOR: Because of the treasure you mentioned.\nSABLE: Not “treasure” singular — “treasures”. Technological, biological, mechanical.\nNYSSA: You’re completely certain they have these things here?\nSABLE: Why else cut themselves off from the rest of the galaxy?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they just didn’t care for the neighbours. It seems to me you’re risking a lot on wishful thinking.\nSABLE: Other scavengers have made bigger scores on flimsier hunches.\nDOCTOR: You’re a scavenger, then. I thought I recognised the look.\nNYSSA: You want to steal and sell whatever the inhabitants left behind.\nDOCTOR: Some people might call that grave-robbing.\nSABLE: There’s usually very little in a grave worth nicking, apart from gold fillings and the odd piece of jewellery. A whole planet at your disposal, though — that’s the ultimate score.\nSHAUN: (D) Sable, I just picked up a weird reading.\nSABLE: Give me a minute, Shaun, I’m busy educating these nice people.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 33\nSABLE: SCENE 17: INT. SABLE AND SHAUN’S SHIP (CONTINUOUS)\nSHAUN: No, don’t cut me off, don’t cut me off! Stupid!\nSHAUN: I’m sorry about this, Sable. I know you’d do the same were me.\nSHAUN: if\nSHAUN: it\nSHAUN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 34\nSHAUN: SCENE 18: EXT. ZALTYS FIELDS\nDOCTOR: Sable, listen to me — we’re perfectly happy to let you deal with your conscience and the authorities.\nNYSSA: We are?\nDOCTOR: Yes, we’re only here for our friends — Tegan and Adric. I was expecting to find them quite close by. I’m not sure why we haven’t come across them yet.\nSABLE: Because you’ve been looking in the wrong direction. See that glass dome?\nDOCTOR: Yes, what’s it for? It doesn’t seem to contain anything.\nSABLE: We may not know much about Zaltys, but we do know its inhabitants preferred to live underground.\nDOCTOR: I imagine that spending too long out in the open would be rather wearying on the eyes.\nSABLE: I’m betting that’s one of the entrances to their main city. Once I’ve had a bit of a scout round—\nSABLE: SHOOTS OFF.\nSABLE: What the...? Shaun, what do you think you’re doing?\nDOCTOR: Leaving Zaltys, I should say.\nSABLE: Shaun, respond! Get back here, dammit! Shaun! Shaun!\nDOCTOR: It seems you’re stranded — just like my two friends.\nSABLE: I can’t believe he just took off and left me here.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 35\nNYSSA: Perhaps he had good reason. If the instruments on your ship finally detected the contamination...\nSABLE: Still, he wouldn’t have just taken off!\nDOCTOR: By then, you’d removed your helmet and breathed the same air as us.\nNYSSA: Doctor, if that were the case... we’re already dead.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR: SCENE 19: INT. EXEMPLAR — CORRIDOR\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER SPEAKER) There’s nowhere for you to go, Tegan.\nTEGAN: If you really thought that, you wouldn’t be watching me on your little cameras.\nTEGAN: Is that you doing that?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I promise you, it’s not. As a matter of fact, I’m as surprised as you are.\nTEGAN: (GOING OVER) Adric? Is that you?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Why not use your little device and open the hatch?\nTEGAN: It’s a trick.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) There’s only one way to be certain.\nTEGAN: It is a trick, and a sick one. There’s no-one here but a dead woman.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Then who was that knocking?\nTEGAN: (STARTLED) Ah!!! — What are you?\nTEGAN: (ALARM) No, get away from me! Get back!!!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 37\nWOMAN: END OF PART ONE\nWOMAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 38"

(AS SHE PUSHES) .. hands off!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Thank you.\nCLARIMONDE: HATCH.\nTEGAN: What was she?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Surprisingly, still alive. My apologies for that, I’1l take care of it.\nTEGAN: What?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Watch the screen to your left.\nWOMAN: DOOR CLOSES AGAIN.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) The best way to be rid of useless rubbish — simply eject it into space.\nTEGAN: We're on a ship?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) You didn’t realise?\nTEGAN: Of course I didn’t! I would never... (ANGRY) That woman was still alive!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 40\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I’m so grateful for your assistance, Tegan. I think you and I are going to have a lot of fun together. Perhaps it’s time we finally met.\nTEGAN: I don’t think you’d like that.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) You’re not cross, are you?\nTEGAN: More than a little bit!\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Well, I shall take my chances. Now follow my directions. First, turn around and head back the way you came. You’1ll come to a junction in about twenty yards— I notice you’re not walking.\nTEGAN: Why should I?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Because you’re a friend of the Doctor, which means you’re brave and inquisitive and also foolhardy. No matter how scared you are right now — and you are scared — you’ll come. At the junction, turn right...\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 41\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 21: INT. ZALTYS — DOME\nDOCTOR: (AS HE TURNS) Nearly there. Just a few more turns, I think.\nSABLE: Come on, Doctor, put your back into it. Give him a hand, Nyssa. I’d help, but it’d mean putting down my gun.\nNYSSA: You don’t need it, Sable. We’re not your competitors. In fact, with your ship gone, I can’t imagine what it is you want any more.\nSABLE: Answers, whatever useful data I can get my hands on. And a way off this planet.\nDOCTOR: (STRAINS AS HE LIFTS) There! Zaltys awaits. After you, Sable.\nSABLE: No. After you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: On one condition.\nSABLE: You don’t get to set the conditions. I’m the one with the gun, remember.\nDOCTOR: That’s the condition. Not everyone is like you and your friends, you know. You can certainly come with us in our ship once we’re done. I’1l even take you to a medical facility if we have all been infected. But I must insist that you either put that gun away or point it somewhere else.\nSABLE: You’re bargaining from a very weak position.\nDOCTOR: I’m not bargaining at all. But please don’t think you’1l be able to pilot the TARDIS without me. It takes around a hundred and seventy years to get used to her little quirks and foibles. So: after you.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 47\nADRIC: (CALLING) Hello? Hello? Where am I, some kind of planet of the de- [ad?] (BREAKS OFF; SPOTTING THE COMPUTER) I don’t believe it! A computer station!\nADRIC: At last, something I can use..! You’1ll talk to me, won’t you, computer?\nADRIC: I’m afraid I’ve given up on people — they’re unreliable. Even the best ones change... sometimes more than you’d expect. I wonder if the Doctor’s even trying to find me...\nCOMPUTER: Unauthorised access to vault facility materials detected. Initiating security measures.\nADRIC: No, no, wait. (THINKS) Just tell me who’s accessed you recently?\nADRIC: Talia, Perrault and Gevaudan [ADRIC PRONOUNCES THEM AS WRITTEN]. I don’t really feel like a Talia. So I’1l1 be... Perrault.\nCOMPUTER: Welcome... Perrault. You sound different.\nADRIC: I, er — (FAKING COLD) I’ve got a cold... which seems to be affecting my memory. Please, computer, remind me where I am?\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 43\nADRIC: SCENE 23: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — STAIRWELL\nNYSSA: I suppose it’s too much to hope that we might find some cure for the contamination down here somewhere?\nDOCTOR: If that were the case, Nyssa, there’d be survivors too, surely.\nNYSSA: I did say it was too much to hope for.\nSABLE: We’ve come too far down to turn back now.\nNYSSA: Look at all those walkways — it reminds me of the Urbankan ship, but on an even bigger scale. It seems to go on for miles.\nSABLE: I think we can safely say that these people didn’t discover the secret of anti-gravity.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think you can safely rule out that possibility, Sable. Good exercise, though.\nSABLE: I’m starting to wonder if these people even discovered the lift. I’m glad they’re all dead.\nPERRAULT: (D; OVER TANNOY) This is a reminder [that the incident is now two hours away precisely. ]\nPERRAULT: NYSSA and SABLE:\nPERRAULT: (D; OVER TANNOY) Although if you need reminding of that, you shouldn’t be working here in the first place.\nDOCTOR: Well, well. I admire his sense of timing, whoever he is.\nNYSSA: Now we know they’re not all dead.\nSABLE: OK, so one person’s alive.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR: More than one, surely. He doesn’t need a public address system to speak to himself.\nSABLE: When we find him, I’1ll be sure to ask him how many friends he has down here.\nNYSSA: And what he means when he says the incident is two hours away. What incident?\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 45\nNYSSA: SCENE 24: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 47\nCOMPUTER: It seems your voice has returned to normal, Perrault.\nADRIC: Yes, but just for a moment. I’m afraid I’ve had a relapse.\nCOMPUTER: I am sorry to hear that.\nADRIC: And my memory isn’t any better. Remind me about the incident.\nCOMPUTER: Potential extinction level event.\nADRIC: Extinction? Show me.\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 46\nADRIC: SCENE 25: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nSABLE: Now this is the first time we’ve seen a computerised lock. Whatever we’re looking for, I’m betting it’s behind this door.\nNYSSA: Bear in mind, Sable, we’re both looking for very different things.\nDOCTOR: Nevertheless, I think we should take a look. — Hmm. With this many numbers, the possible combinations run into the millions. Fortunately, I have a fair bit of experience in this field. Now stand back-\nSABLE: You stand back.\nDOCTOR: What-? No!\nDOCTOR: DOOR OPENS AUTOMATICALLY.\nDOCTOR: You know, there was just as much chance that shooting that\nDOCTOR: combination pad would have locked us out permanently.\nSABLE: What can I say, I felt lucky. Let’s go.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 47\nSABLE: SCENE 26: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 47\nCOMPUTER: Object detected two hundred and thirty-eight days ago. From its path and velocity, projections indicate it will enter Zaltys atmosphere in one hour and fifty-six minutes. Fifty-five.\nADRIC: A meteor, big enough to destroy an entire civilization?\nCOMPUTER: As you anticipated.\nADRIC: Oh, that’s right, I’m Perrault [PRONOUNCES IT CORRECTLY FROM NOW ON], aren’t I? — Computer, show me the path of the object before it arrived in this system.\nADRIC: Well, that’s not right.\nGEVAUDAN: (OFF-MIC) Hello?\nADRIC: (ALARM; TO SELF) Who’s-?\nGEVAUDAN: (OFF-MIC, APPROACHING) Someone’s there, who is that? Speak to me.\nADRIC: Never mind. Forget I was ever here, computer.\nCOMPUTER: Clarify ‘forget’. Do you wish me to delete recent data? (BEAT)\nCOMPUTER: Repeat: Do you wish me to delete recent data?\nGEVAUDAN: (AT COMPUTER NOW) Well, now. That’s interesting.\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 48\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 27: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CRYO-CHAMBERS\nDOCTOR: You wondered what became of the inhabitants of Zaltys, Sable? Well, here’s a few hundred thousand of them, all in cryogenic stasis capsules.\nSABLE: This isn’t possible...!\nDOCTOR: As I had occasion to say to a friend of mine earlier today, it appears to have happened, so evidently it is possible.\nNYSSA: This chamber’s enormous! It seems to stretch on for miles.\nDOCTOR: And it may not be the only one.\nSABLE: What do you mean?\nNYSSA: You think the entire population might have been placed in hibernation?\nDOCTOR: Minus the voice we heard, and whomever he was addressing.\nSABLE: No, no, it’s impossible.\nDOCTOR: So you said! Yet, here we are. Please start coming to terms with the reality of your surroundings, it’ll make things so much easier.\nNYSSA: I think Sable means that the scale is almost unthinkable. Have you ever seen anything like it before, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Once or twice. A race of bio-mechanicals on Telos... oh, anda species of intelligent reptiles on Earth.\nNYSSA: Both races froze themselves voluntarily?\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: Well, in the case of the Earth reptiles - the Silurians - it was a question of self-preservation. They were convinced they were on the threshold of being wiped out by a large spatial obj—[ect.] (BREAKS OFF) Now that’s an alarming thought.\nSABLE: More alarming than the possibility that we’re all dying right now?\nDOCTOR: I was just wondering if the people of Zaltys might not have gone into stasis for similar reasons. That would certainly\nDOCTOR: explain the nature of the impending incident, wouldn’t it?\nSABLE: Then there’s no plague?\nDOCTOR: We don’t know. It’s just an assumption based on several lifetimes’ accumulated personal experience.\nNYSSA: Doctor, could Adric and Tegan be here somewhere?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Perhaps.\nSABLE: Cryogenics... There might be money in that. (WANDERING OFF) Wonder if there are any schematics around here...?\nDOCTOR: Sable, don’t touch anything!\nSABLE: Don’t panic. Just one of a hundred thousand [bodies. ]\nDOCTOR: Why not try listening to me for a change?\nSABLE: OK, we'd better get out of here. Back to the TARDIS, yeah?\nNYSSA: Not without our friends!\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nSABLE: Oh, come on! We could be here forever!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Sable — you keep looking together,\nSABLE: Brilliant. That’1ll only take fifty years.\nDOCTOR: We have less than two hours.\nSABLE: Fine, here!\nSABLE: We'll keep in touch by radio. Nyssa, come\nSABLE: Page 50\nSABLE: I’1ll carry on alone.\nSABLE: on!\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 51\nSABLE: SCENE 28: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 47\nPERRAULT: (D; OVER THE RADIO) Gevaudan, do you hear the alarm?\nGEVAUDAN: I can barely hear anything else, Perrault. Turn it off, please, it’s making my fur stand on end.\nGEVAUDAN: Thank you.\nPERRAULT: (D) One of the cryo-capsules appears to have been breached. It’s probably another fault, but we have our orders.\nGEVAUDAN: We made our orders.\nPERRAULT: (D) Yes, I suppose we did. I shall miss all this, you know. Assuming the three of us don’t...\nGEVAUDAN: Where are you now, Perrault?\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 52\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 29: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nPERRAULT: Command centre, obviously.\nGEVAUDAN: (D; OVER THE RADIO) You weren’t at console forty-seven a few minutes ago?\nPERRAULT: Console-? No. Talia and I have been sat here talking.\nTALIA: What makes you think he was at console forty-seven, Gevaudan?\nGEVAUDAN: (D) I don’t. The computer does.\nPERRAULT: Another fault? It’s only to be expected, I supposed.\nGEVAUDAN: (D) Not a fault — an intruder.\nTALIA: An intruder?\nGEVAUDAN: (D) Possibly several. And I think one of them may be... gifted.\nPERRAULT: I’m sure you’re mistaken. There hasn’t been an intruder on Zaltys since—\nGEVAUDAN: (D) Since me.\nTALIA: Track down the intruders, Gevaudan.\nPERRAULT: By all means do what you can, but be back here before the deadline. I don’t want any of us to be on our own when the time comes.\nGEVAUDAN: (D) My oath to Zaltys comes first, Perrault. Out.\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 53\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 30: INT. EXEMPLAR — BRIDGE\nGEVAUDAN: GRADUALLY APPROACHES CLARIMONDE.\nCLARIMONDE: Welcome to the bridge of the Exemplar, Tegan. It’s a pleasure to meet you in person.\nTEGAN: Sorry I can’t say I feel the same way.\nCLARIMONDE: And I’m sorry you didn’t bring the Doctor with you. Where is he, by the way?\nTEGAN: I wish I knew.\nCLARIMONDE: Does he know where you are?\nTEGAN: Even I don’t know where I am! I came here by accident, you know that. I didn’t even know I was on a ship until a few minutes ago. Why don’t you have any windows? I thought you said this was the bridge? Don’t you want to be able to see out?\nCLARIMONDE: Who needs windows when you have monitors? Are there windows on the TARDIS?\nTEGAN: No, but at least the lights are usually on. And the screen isn’t tinted, either.\nCLARIMONDE: We find it relaxing.\nTEGAN: You keep saying ‘we’, but I haven’t seen anyone else — not anyone like you, I mean.\nCLARIMONDE: The crew are resting at the moment. I like to keep things informal. But don’t worry, they’ll be up and around quite soon. Quite soon. How does forty minutes suit you — as a head-start, I mean?\nTEGAN: Head-start?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 54\nCLARIMONDE: You want to make the hunt fun for them, don’t you?\nTEGAN: You’re not really going to hunt me?!\nCLARIMONDE: Why not? We have a little time to pass before we land, we might as well keep ourselves amused.\nTEGAN: I won’t be amused!\nCLARIMONDE: You’re not supposed to be, that’s the point of the hunt. You need to be frightened for your life, or it’s no fun when you get caught.\nTEGAN: And what exactly happens when I get caught?\nCLARIMONDE: You saw the husk in the airlock? Well, that’s what happens. You should be grateful I haven’t started the countdown yet, or you’d be wasting valuable time just standing here talking.\nTEGAN: What if I don’t feel like running? What if I decide to stay here and give you a lesson in what being tough really means, Captain whatever-your-name-is?\nCLARIMONDE: Clarimonde. If you did try to do that, I’d simply ask you to examine my finger.\nTEGAN: That ring, you mean? Is it some kind of weapon?\nCLARIMONDE: A weapon? No. I liberated it from one of my victims, a particularly foul, feral creature. No, I simply wanted you to see what I can do with a single — jab!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 55\nCLARIMONDE: And that I was able to do with one finger. If I put my whole hand on your head and squeezed, I could turn your skull to powder. You’re welcome to stay and take me at my word, but I’d advise you to run. The countdown begins... now.\nCLARIMONDE: OFF THE SECONDS.\nCLARIMONDE: Run, Tegan. Run.\nTEGAN: You’re.. you’re nuts!\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 56\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 31: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 322\nDOCTOR: Sable, can you hear me?\nSABLE: (D; OVER THE RADIO) Still here. Still stranded here, wasting what remains of my life.\nDOCTOR: Could I possibly speak to Nyssa, please?\nSABLE: (D) Fine. Nyssa, it’s for you. He didn’t give his name.\nNYSSA: (D) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think I’m on the right track. Well, Adric’s track.\nNYSSA: (D) You've seen him?\nDOCTOR: No, but I’ve found traces of him — spoor, you might say. It was a reasonable assumption that he’d try to access this facility’s computer system. And I think I’ve located the console he used.\nNYSSA: (D) You’re there now?\nDOCTOR: Not yet, I’ve only just identified the breach.\nDOCTOR: THE COMPUTER FROM SCENE 21.\nCOMPUTER: Welcome... Perrault. You sound different.\nADRIC: I, er — (FAKING COLD) I’ve got a cold.. which seems to be affecting my memory. Please, computer, remind me where I am?\nDOCTOR: And I try so hard to keep him honest. Adric hacked into console forty-seven. And I’m at... console three-two-two.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 57\nSABLE: (D) Brilliant, we’re coming to where you are!\nDOCTOR: No, not yet. I don’t know whether or not Tegan’s with him.\nDOCTOR: need you two to keep looking.\nSABLE: (D) Oh, this is utterly pointl-\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Now... where is console forty-seven?\nDOCTOR: I\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: SCENE 32: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CRYO-CHAMBERS\nSABLE: We’re running out of time and I’m running out of patience, Nyssa! I’1l1 take a brilliant idea, if you feel like you’ve got one in you?\nNYSSA: I wouldn’t say it was brilliant, but I’m wondering if I could run a scan of all the cryo-chambers for any traces of foreign DNA.\nSABLE: And how long’s that gonna take?\nNYSSA: If the Doctor’s right, and Adric’s at large in the facility somewhere, the task will take half as much time as I originally estimated.\nSABLE: But that still means scanning the whole planet, right?\nNYSSA: Not necessarily. The Doctor traced the psychic attack on the TARDIS to this point.\nSABLE: Wait, wait, wait. This is the first I’m hearing about any psychic attack.\nNYSSA: That’s what brought us here in the first place. Adric was taken when he was at the controls; then Tegan was abducted, too.\nSABLE: Adric was at the controls? Good pilot, is he?\nNYSSA: Not completely reliable.\nSABLE: Uh-huh. To the best of my knowledge, only one person from Zaltys ever goes off-planet, and he definitely doesn’t have those abilities. So who does?\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 59\nSABLE: SCENE 33: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nGEVAUDAN: (APPROACHING) Come out, come out, wherever you are. (STOPS) I’m joking, of course. I know precisely where you are. Cowering behind the cooling conductor. So there’s no point in hiding.\nADRIC: (STEPPING OUT, NERVOUSLY) But — you couldn’t have seen me!\nGEVAUDAN: I don’t want to hurt you, Adric. It is Adric, isn’t it?\nADRIC: How did you know that?\nGEVAUDAN: You really shouldn’t be here.\nADRIC: Fine, then I’1l1 go!\nGEVAUDAN: (STRUGGLING TO KEEP HOLD OF ADRIC) You’re not going anywhere unless it’s with me! Keep still! Adric, please stop struggling.\nADRIC: All right, all right! Just let go of me!\nGEVAUDAN: I’d rather not. Now come with me.\nADRIC: Where are you taking me?\nGEVAUDAN: We’re going to talk to some friends of mine about your unexpected arrival. You have no cause for concern, the people of Zaltys are nowhere near as hostile as other races tend to believe.\nADRIC: And do they all have fur and fangs, like you?\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 60\nGEVAUDAN: No, no, no. As a matter of fact, they look rather like you — just a little taller. My name is Gevaudan, I am a Vulpine, from a planet on the fringes of this system, but— Adric, I know you’re thinking of stabbing me in the wrist with the pin of your badge for mathematical excellence before making a run for it. Please don’t. Varsh would be very disappointed in you.\nADRIC: You know my name, you know my brother’s name. You’re reading my mind, aren’t you?\nGEVAUDAN: Possibly. Let’s simply say that while I have that ability, it’s considered quite bad-mannered to use it on Zaltys. I can trust you to keep my secret. You’re good at keeping secrets, aren’t you, Adric?\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 61\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 34: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMPUTER STATION 47\nDOCTOR: Well, this is console forty-seven, and Adric is... nowhere to be seen. (SIGHS) Why does nobody do what I want them to?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Sable — please tell me you’ve found Tegan.\nNYSSA: (D: OVER THE RADIO) I’m working on something, Doctor.\nSABLE: (D) And I’m encouraging her to do it faster, it makes me feel like I’m participating. We can’t have much more than an hour before this incident, whatever it is.\nDOCTOR: One hour, twenty-seven minutes and seventeen seconds.\nSABLE: (D) Glad one of us is wearing a watch.\nDOCTOR: I’m not, I’m just very good with time. Keep me informed of your progress, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (D) What are you going to be doing?\nDOCTOR: Approaching the matter from a different angle. I presume there’s some sort of central control room. I think we need to speak to the gentleman whose voice we heard...\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR: SCENE 35: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nDOCTOR: (NB: TALIA’S REVULSION AT THE PRESENCE OF A “FOREIGNER” ON HER HOME SOIL GROWS AS THE SCENE PROGRESSES )\nTALIA: An alien? Here?\nGEVAUDAN: (D; OVER THE RADIO) There is a precedent, Talia.\nTALIA: Yes, but why now?\nPERRAULT: Has he said anything?\nGEVAUDAN: (D) His name is Adric. His origins are... complicated.\nTALIA: Gevaudan, he can’t stay here!\nGEVAUDAN: (D) Surely it won’t matter soon.\nTALIA: He has to leave!\nADRIC: (D) I’d be quite happy with that arrangement, actually.\nTALIA: Don’t let him speak again! And don’t bring him here, I don’t want to even see him!\nPERRAULT: It’s quite all right, Talia, you won’t have to. Remain where you are, Gevaudan, I’m coming to you.\nTALIA: What for, Perrault?\nPERRAULT: Because I, for one, am interested in our visitor. Aliens on Zaltys are so rare, I’d like to see a second one before I die.\nTALIA: What about what you were just saying?\nTALIA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 63\nPERRAULT: I meant it. I promise you, when the time comes, we’ll all be together.\nPERRAULT: CLOSES AGAIN.\nTALIA: But not with that alien. Never with him.\nTALIA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 64\nTALIA: SCENE 36: INT. EXEMPLAR — CORRIDOR\nTALIA: ALONG.\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER SPEAKER) You’re doing very well, Tegan.\nTEGAN: You’re not helping.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) That was never my intention.\nTEGAN: I thought you were giving me a head-start. How’s that supposed to work if you’re watching me every step of the way?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Every hesitant step. And I’m not partaking in the hunt. I simply enjoy your company.\nTEGAN: The feeling is far from mutual. Where are all these supposed hunters, anyway?\nCLARIMONDE: At present, preserving their strength for the task ahead. But once the countdown stops, they’ll be everywhere.\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 65\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 37: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nCLARIMONDE: FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THEY STOP UPON MEETING.\nPERRAULT: Well, well! The famous Adric!\nADRIC: I can’t be famous. I’ve not been here long enough.\nPERRAULT: Nevertheless, a large percentage of this planet’s population are talking about you.\nGEVAUDAN: Those who remain unfrozen, that is.\nADRIC: Frozen?\nPERRAULT: All will be explained, young man. Now, would you mind if I asked you a few questions?\nADRIC: Why do you need to? Your friend can tell you everything you need to know about me.\nPERRAULT: Yes, but he made a promise not to use his abilities on Zaltys unless absolutely unavoidable. It’s— well, it’s rude.\nCROSS TO: SCENE 38: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE [CONTINUOUS]\nGEVAUDAN: (D; OVER A MONITOR SCREEN) Good manners are highly regarded here, and on my world. It helped to ease my transition somewhat.\nTALIA: Oh, yes, we made every accommodation!\nADRIC: (D) You said something about people being frozen. Are you trying to tell me everyone’s in cryogenic stasis?\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 66\nPERRAULT: (D) It’s rather a long story, I’m afraid we may not have time to tell it. At the moment, I’m more interested in you, young Adric. What is the name of your home planet?\nADRIC: (D) Alzarius.\nPERRAULT: (D) Alzarius, eh? Can’t pretend I’ve ever heard of it. I’m afraid we’re rather parochial here.\nTALIA: (AN EXCLAMATION OF DISBELIEF) That’s it! No more, Perrault! No more!\nADRIC: (D) Actually, Alzarius doesn’t exist within this universe.\nPERRAULT: (D) Really! Some sort of alternate dimension? I have a few theories of my own on that subject...\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 67\nPERRAULT: SCENE 39: INT. EXEMPLAR — CORRIDOR\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER SPEAKER) You seem like an intelligent young woman, Tegan. I’m sure it’s occurred to you that you’re running without any clear idea of where you’re running to.\nTEGAN: Anywhere there’s a way off this ship.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Unfortunately, there’s only one way off this ship for your kind.\nTEGAN: I suppose time will tell, won’t it?\nCLARIMONDE: (D) Not for you, I’m afraid. For you, Tegan, time is most certainly up. Listen.\nTEGAN: Oh, great.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 68\nTEGAN: SCENE 40: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — OUTSIDE THE COMMAND CENTRE\nDOCTOR: Imposing-looking doors. The command centre, I presume.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 41: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE [CONTINUOUS]\nPERRAULT: [It’s not that astronomy is banned on Zaltys precisely, but one couldn’t in all honesty say that it’s actively encouraged. I myself am probably the only person on the entire planet who’s ever visited other worlds — with the exception of yourself and Gevaudan, of course. ]\nDOCTOR: Hello, I’m the— And there’s no-one here again. If it weren’t for my resilient personality, I might start to take this personally. Still, I must be in the right place — couches, kitchen area, monitor screens...\nADRIC: (D) You say there’s not enough time, but then you just keep talking.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING OVER TO MONITOR) And Adric on the monitor screen! Thank heavens!\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nGEVAUDAN: Perrault is a man of immense loquacity, Adric.\nPERRAULT: Indeed. AS a consequence, I’m a positive martyr to sore throats. Lozenge?\nADRIC: No, thank you. I’d sooner hear about what you think is about to happen here.\nPERRAULT: What we think is about to happen?\nGEVAUDAN: Perrault.\nPERRAULT: Curious turn of phrase.\nGEVAUDAN: Perrault! Something’s amiss, I sense it!\nTALIA: You needn’t let it bother you.\nCROSS BACK TO: SCENE 43: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE [CONTINUOUS]\nPERRAULT: (D; OVER THE MONITOR SCREEN) Talia!

I shouldn’t have to tell you, Perrault, this kind of fraternisation is completely forbidden.\nDOCTOR: If only I could find a microphone...\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 70\nPERRAULT: (D) I scarcely think it matters now, does it?\nCROSS BACK TO: SCENE 44: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nGEVAUDAN: The boy hardly represents a threat to security, Talia.\nTALIA: He’s an alien, in the worst sense of the word.\nADRIC: I wish you’d talk to me, instead of about me.\nTALIA: As the custodians of Zaltys, we owe it to the survivors-\nPERRAULT: There may not be any survivors, who would ever know he was here?\nTALIA: He might as well not have been.\nGEVAUDAN: Talia,\nGEVAUDAN: put that gun down!\nCROSS BACK TO: SCENE 45: INT.

EXEMPLAR — CORRIDOR\nTALIA: STEADILY CLOSER (BUT NOT WITHIN SIGHT). TEGAN STEPS HESITANTLY, COMES TO A STOP.\nTEGAN: A dead end. Literally. Fine, you lot know where I am, come and get me. I don’t understand what’s taking you so long, when you can see in the dark and I can’t. Not talking any more, Clarimonde? I know you must be able to hear me, so hear this: I know who you are, and I know what you do. That husk in the airlock should’ve tipped me off, but I think I knew for certain when I saw the Bridge. No windows, you see, because you can’t stand the light of the suns. I didn’t want to admit it to myself until I was this close to dying, but you’re — you’re vampires...!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 73"

EXEMPLAR — DUCTING\nLUSCA: You’re Tegan, yes?\nTEGAN: That’s right.\nLUSCA: I heard Clarimonde taunting you.\nTEGAN: Yeah, she’s a proper little charmer. Not a friend of yours, I’m betting.\nLUSCA: Not to me, nor to any of my kind. My name is Lusca.\nTEGAN: Whatever ‘your kind’ is, I’m glad you’ve got lights in your antennae.\nLUSCA: They help us to see in the depths that the sun doesn’t penetrate.\nTEGAN: Depths? So you’re like a ‘fish-thing’?\nLUSCA: Do I disgust you, Tegan?\nTEGAN: If you’re not planning on drinking my blood, you’re fine with me. You’re not, right?\nLUSCA: No, that is not my way.\nTEGAN: I met a talking frog once, I guess there’s no reason I should have a problem with a talking fish— Wait, don’t you need water?\nLUSCA: Very much. There were tanks aboard my ship, but after the Necrobiologicals seized the crew, they set it adrift in space.\nTEGAN: The necro..? The vampires, you mean?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 79\nLUSCA: Call them what you will. They devoured the others. I’ve been hiding out in the ducting since I got away.\nTEGAN: Good for you, but I hope there’s more to the plan than that. (A BEAT) There isn’t, is there?\nLUSCA: There are small scout ships in the hold, but they’re always guarded.\nTEGAN: Terrific. You’ve not seen a boy aboard this ship, have you? Sort of human, like me?\nLUSCA: The only non-Necrobiologicals here are you and I. Soon, there will only be you. Soon, I will dry out completely, and then...\nTEGAN: You’re not going to die, Lusca.

Couldn’t you see it in her mind?\nGEVAUDAN: The weapon she carries is stolen, Perrault. She has no more idea how it works than— wait!\nPERRAULT: What is it?\nGEVAUDAN: In the command centre. Someone’s waiting for us.\nPERRAULT: That girl again!\nGEVAUDAN: No...\nGEVAUDAN: No, this one’s friendly.\nGEVAUDAN: INTO:\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 8&1\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 52: INT.

(GRUNTS WHILE SETTING DOWN TALIA’S BODY)\nDOCTOR: I don’t pretend to be an expert on weaponry, but it looked very much to me like she was hit by a sustained burst of helicon energy. Her neuropeptides will have been severely disrupted. Very unpleasant.\nPERRAULT: Will she recover?\nDOCTOR: There’s at least a fifty-fifty chance. I’m sorry I can’t offer more encouragement than that. Rest is all I can suggest at this point.\nPERRAULT: Your friend did this!\nDOCTOR: Not my friend. Nyssa and I encountered Sable while we were above ground, looking for Adric.\nGEVAUDAN: He’s telling the truth, Perrault.\nDOCTOR: Of course, I thought I recognised you. You’re a Vulpine.\nGEVAUDAN: You’ve met more of my people?\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR: I get around. But you must already know that, since all Vulpine are telepathic. I imagine you’re reading my thoughts right now.\nGEVAUDAN: Trying to.. ‘Doctor’. But one could easily get lost in there if one tried to delve too deeply.\nDOCTOR: I must say, I’m rather surprised to see you here. I don’t know a great deal about Zaltys, but I understood there was a general dislike for anything alien here. Talia’s reaction to Adric certainly gave that impression.\nGEVAUDAN: I feel such hatred on a daily basis, Doctor.\nPERRAULT: Not from me!\nGEVAUDAN: Never from you, old friend. Most people on this planet are polite enough not to voice their prejudices. Which is no real comfort to a telepath, but one appreciates the effort.\nPERRAULT: I discovered Gevaudan on one of my trips off-planet.\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t aware that your people made any.\nPERRAULT: The odd diplomatic mission, Doctor — mostly to stress that we won’t be opening up channels of communication, or trade with\nPERRAULT: other worlds. On my way back from Occhinos some years ago, I\nPERRAULT: discovered Gevaudan in an escape capsule.\nDOCTOR: What happened?\nGEVAUDAN: We were attacked by — raiders. The rest of the crew were slaughtered, including my mate.\nPERRAULT: His injuries were great. But I couldn’t leave him to die.\nDOCTOR: So you brought him back here, despite the hostility his arrival would engender.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 83\nGEVAUDAN: To allay the people’s fears, I renounced my homeworld and pledged my undying allegiance to Zaltys.\nDOCTOR: Even though it meant leaving everything behind?\nGEVAUDAN: With my beloved gone, I had nothing to go back for. — You’re no stranger to leaving everything behind, Doctor. I sense... your family on Gallifrey are still at the forefront of your thoughts.\nPERRAULT: Gallifrey? You’re a Time Lord, then?\nDOCTOR: Originally. More of a traveller these days, and not much of one without my companions. I’ve been trying to track them from here, but this complex is positively labyrinthine.\nGEVAUDAN: There may not be enough time to rescue them now. We’re all of us under a sentence of death, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. An object is on a collision course with Zaltys.\nPERRAULT: How did you kno—? Ah. You hacked into our computer system, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: No, Adric did that. This was more in the way of an educated guess.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR: SCENE 53: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: Adric, please tell me you know where Tegan is.\nADRIC: Why, isn’t she with you?\nNYSSA: She vanished from the TARDIS shortly after you did.\nADRIC: Well, where is she now?\nNYSSA: That’s what I want to know!\nSABLE: Less talking, more fleeing.\nADRIC: Who are you, anyway?\nSABLE: What did I just say about the talking and the fleeing?\nNYSSA: Flee to where, Sable? All these walkways look the sa— No, wait!\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nNYSSA: SCENE 54: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nGEVAUDAN: (HAVING HEARD NYSSA TELEPATHICALLY) Wait for what?\nDOCTOR: Hm? I didn’t say anything about waiting.\nGEVAUDAN: My apologies, Doctor. Do continue.\nGEVAUDAN: Page 85\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 55: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY\nGEVAUDAN: Page 86\nGEVAUDAN: — CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: I recognise this place! We can from here.\nADRIC: No, Nyssa, we can’t!\nSABLE: I don’t want to get into a war we can, that’s good enough for\nADRIC: make our way back to the hatch\nADRIC: of the swots here. If she says me. Lead the way, Nyssa.\nADRIC: I mean, if we’re heading for the TARDIS we can’t take a familiar route. That wolf-being who caught me, Gevaudan — he’s a telepath, he can read thoughts.\nSABLE: So he’1ll know where we’re headed as soon as we do.\nNYSSA: That’s how he knew my name!\nNYSSA: Brilliant.\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 8&7\nNYSSA: SCENE 56: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nGEVAUDAN: (HAVING HEARD NYSSA TELEPATHICALLY) Yes, that’s correct.\nPERRAULT: What is?\nGEVAUDAN: What... you were just saying.\nPERRAULT: Are you quite all right, Gevaudan?\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 88&\nPERRAULT: SCENE 57: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nSABLE: You reckon this Gevaudan’s the one who brought Adric here?\nNYSSA: It’s the only explanation. But I wonder why.\nSABLE: I’d like it a lot better if you wondered from a safe distance. Come on.\nADRIC: Where are we supposed to be going?\nSABLE: Well, that’s the challenge, isn’t it? I mean, have you ever tried to get somewhere by going in the wrong direction?\nNYSSA: Only Heathrow Airport.\nADRIC: We can’t just leave, what about the Doctor?\nSABLE: Oh, he’1ll catch up with us eventually, he seems pretty resourceful for a man with a vegetable pinned to his coat.\nADRIC: There’s something important I need to tell him.\nSABLE: If it’s about the vegetable, I agree. I mean, I like a man who can rock his own look, but that’s a bit much.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 89\nSABLE: SCENE 58: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nPERRAULT: You see, Doctor, even if the meteor doesn’t actually impact the surface of Zaltys, the devastation will be planet-wide.\nDOCTOR: So the entire population is placed in suspended animation underground, in the hope that they’1ll simply sleep through the catastrophe.\nPERRAULT: With a handful of volunteers remaining awake to monitor the equipment.\nDOCTOR: Quite possibly committing suicide in the process.\nPERRAULT: I’d always wanted to go in my sleep. Now it seems I’11 be one of the few people on the planet who won’t. Fate is hilariously cruel sometimes.\nDOCTOR: You could come with me in the TARDIS, Perrault. You, Gevaudan, Talia.\nPERRAULT: But then who would be here to keep watch over the population of our planet? We’re already taking a tremendous risk, trusting that the reawakening will occur automatically if we’re killed. Can you imagine what might happen if they oversleep?\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately, I can. — I must congratulate you on putting all of this into motion within a few months. I doubt even my own people could have managed it.\nPERRAULT: We can be extremely single-minded, Doctor. That’s not always to the good, unfortunately, but in this case-\nGEVAUDAN: She blinked! Talia just blinked.\nPERRAULT: Well, that’s— Is that a good sign, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: If she makes it through the meteor strike. I don’t suppose there’s a spare cryo-capsule for her?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 90\nGEVAUDAN: Even if there were, there’s not enough time to place her inside.\nDOCTOR: And no time to find my friends? I’ve tried contacting them by radio, but Sable doesn’t seem inclined to answer.\nDOCTOR: That’s it, I’ve wasted too much time here, I’m going to look\nDOCTOR: for them.\nGEVAUDAN: No, Doctor — you need to monitor Talia’s condition. I’1l go.\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 9]\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 59: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: (HAVING HEARD GEVAUDAN TELEPATHICALLY) Go where?\nSABLE: What?\nNYSSA: What?\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 92\nNYSSA: SCENE 60: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nPERRAULT: I thought you said you couldn’t track them, Gevaudan.\nGEVAUDAN: There may be a way. Tell me, Doctor, your friend Nyssa — is she gifted?\nDOCTOR: In almost every subject, bar telebiogenesis. It can be quite irritating.\nGEVAUDAN: I mean gifted psychically.\nDOCTOR: What, Nyssa? No, no, not at all.\nGEVAUDAN: Strange.\nGEVAUDAN: (DEPARTING) I shall be back with your friends — I hope.\nPERRAULT: Take care, Gevaudan.\nDOCTOR: Your friend’s something of a lone— er... character.\nPERRAULT: But loyal to Zaltys, Doctor. Fiercely loyal.\nDOCTOR: (TOUCH SUSPICIOUS) And also ‘gifted’\nPERRAULT: You say you’ve met others of his kind — then you’1l know their psychic abilities are somewhat limited. Gevaudan could, if he\nPERRAULT: wished, read our minds from a few rooms away, but no ordinary\nPERRAULT: Vulpine could manage a greater distance.\nDOCTOR: No ordinary Vulpine. That’s a rather worrying thought.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: SCENE 61: INT. EXEMPLAR — DUCTING\nTEGAN: Clarimonde said this ship was about to land. I was just supposed to be some kind of ‘entertainment’ to keep the crew occupied for a bit. Obviously, they’ve never heard of in-flight movies.\nLUSCA: ‘Moo-vees’?\nTEGAN: Doesn’t matter, Lusca. What matters is, there’s going to be a way off this ship once it arrives wherever it’s headed.\nLUSCA: We won’t be allowed to simply walk down the ramp, Tegan.\nTEGAN: That’s not the plan.\nLUSCA: Then there is a plan?\nTEGAN: Sure. But it’s going to involve split-second timing. There’s just one problem with that.\nLUSCA: What?\nTEGAN: It all depends on us being in the right place when we’re coming into land. But I have no idea when that’s going to be.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 94\nTEGAN: SCENE 62: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nDOCTOR: Talia’s pulse is almost back to normal.\nPERRAULT: Hopefully, she’ll be up and about in time for the end of the\nPERRAULT: world. I must confess, I rather envy you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nPERRAULT: Yes, how wonderful to have the entire universe to travel,\nPERRAULT: near-infinite amount of time in which to do so.\nDOCTOR: Not quite infinite, that’s a common misconception.\nPERRAULT: anda\nPERRAULT: But the Gallifreyan lifespan is significantly longer than ours.\nDOCTOR: Like a library or a bank balance, it’s more a question of what\nDOCTOR: you do with it, than how much of it you have.\nADRIC: (D; OVER THE RADIO) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The radio!\nDOCTOR: Adric! Adric, where are you?\nADRIC: (D) I didn’t think you’d come looking for me!\nDOCTOR: Then how do you think Nyssa got here? Never mind, just tell me\nDOCTOR: where you are.\nSABLE: (D) Give me that radio back, I’ve changed my mind.\nADRIC: (D) Doctor, there’s something I need to tell you. It’s about\nADRIC: the meteor!\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR: I know about the meteor, Adric. Just tell me where you are!\nADRIC: (D) Look at the trajectory data, Doctor! Why does the meteor never-\nDOCTOR: Adric! Someone’s looking for you, but I want you to take care\nDOCTOR: to avoid him. I’m not sure I completely trust him. Adric?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: SCENE 63: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nADRIC: Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor?\nSABLE: Page 96\nSABLE: No, he can’t. Oh dear, what a pity, never mind. Give me that\nSABLE: radio.\nNYSSA: What did you mean about the trajectory?\nSABLE: Yes, Adric, what did you mean about the trajectory?\nADRIC: There’s an object approaching this world—\nSABLE: That much I know. That’s why Shaun abandoned me. That’s why the population put themselves into cold storage, not because of any\nSABLE: plague. Now tell me what I don’t know.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 97\nSABLE: SCENE 64: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nDOCTOR: There doesn’t seem to be anything mechanical wrong with the radio, so why won’t it work?\nPERRAULT: Perhaps a side-effect of the meteor’s proximity?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Nothing else is affected. It’s as though the Signal’s being blocked somehow, and I think it’s more than peculiar that it should just cut out the moment Adric wanted to tell me something important.\nPERRAULT: Perhaps it’s something to do with the scavenger. She’s already shot Talia, who knows what else she’s capable of? Quite frankly, Doctor, I’m surprised that you can question Gevaudan’s trustworthiness, when this Sable person is trying to kill my friends.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t trust Sable one bit, but I’m beginning to think I should be more wary of Gevaudan.\nPERRAULT: For pity’s sake, why?\nDOCTOR: Because when Adric and Tegan vanished from my ship, my first thought was that we’d suffered some sort of psychic attack.\nPERRAULT: Yes, where is this Tegan? She doesn’t appear to be anywhere in the facility.\nDOCTOR: Which is why I now think I was wrong.\nPERRAULT: There was no attack?\nDOCTOR: No. I think that my ship simply interrupted the psychic communication between two powerful telepaths. I imagine Adric was transported to one end of the conversation — here, on Zaltys — and Tegan to the other.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 98\nPERRAULT: I told you, Doctor, no ordinary Vulpine is that powerful.\nDOCTOR: Then perhaps he’s not that ordinary, hm? Perhaps his powers have mutated. It’s possible, isn’t it?\nPERRAULT: And he somehow hid it from all of us? From me?\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nPERRAULT: Why?\nDOCTOR: Well, I don’t know, but I imagine it has something to do with what Adric was trying to tell me.\nPERRAULT: You think Gevaudan blocked the signal psychically?\nDOCTOR: Yes, perhaps.\nPERRAULT: So what was Adric trying to tell you? Something about the trajectory of the meteor?\nDOCTOR: Let’s take a look and see if we can work it out.\nPERRAULT: Look at that! We have mere minutes left!\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 99\nPERRAULT: SCENE 65: INT. EXEMPLAR — BRIDGE\nCLARIMONDE: Attention, all crew! Your anticipation of the forthcoming feast has made you sloppy! There are two fugitives at large on the Exemplar — the human woman, and an Amphisbane!\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 66: INT. EXEMPLAR — DUCTING (CONTINUOUS)\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER THE TANNOY) They’re presently in the ducting. Sensors detect a blockage immediately above the wormhole generator.\nTEGAN: Uh-oh.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I want them found and drained immediately!\nTEGAN: What’s a wormhole generator?\nLUSCA: Tegan, they know where we are!\nTEGAN: There’s not much time. I just hope we’re headed in the right direction.\nLUSCA: You’re not certain?\nTEGAN: I wouldn’t be certain even if I were stood up and walking round. You’re just going to have to trust me.\nLUSCA: I do trust you, Tegan.\nTEGAN: That makes one of us. Now let’s get moving.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 100\nTEGAN: SCENE 67: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nSABLE: Come on, faster!\nNYSSA: I told you, Sable, we have to take a more circuitous route!\nSABLE: The hell with that! Anyone gets in our way now, they’re dead!\nADRIC: The Doctor wants us to find him!\nSABLE: Then the Doctor’s in for a bitter disappointment! I played along with you lot so long as I thought there was a possibility we'd been infected by some airborne virus. Now I know that was all garbage, I want off this planet, and I want off now!\nADRIC: We won’t be going anywhere without the Doctor!\nSABLE: Oh no? Then why did Nyssa tell me you can pilot the TARDIS, Adric?\nADRIC: Nyssa!\nSABLE: Is that right, Nyssa? He can fly it, can’t he?\nNYSSA: After a fashion.\nSABLE: After a fashion’s good enough for me. Now keep moving.\nADRIC: No!\nSABLE: Are we really going to have to do this, kid? It’s this simple — you get me off Zaltys, or Nyssa dies.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 101\nNYSSA: He won’t help you!\nSABLE: You’re still alive because I’m feeling tolerant. Don’t push your luck. What’s it to be, Adric?\nADRIC: I’1ll help you.\nSABLE: See how easy it is when you have the right encouragement?\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 102\nSABLE: SCENE 68: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nGEVAUDAN: Perrault, Doctor — I think I must be closing in on them. I seem to be able to sense Nyssa’s panic.\nPERRAULT: (D; OVER THE RADIO) Gevaudan-\nDOCTOR: (D) Yes, that’s very good to hear, Gevaudan. Keep it up. Let us know when you have anything more to report. Er, over and out.\nGEVAUDAN: Doctor, we have very little time left.\nDOCTOR: (D) Then don’t waste it talking to me. I said ‘over and out’ and I meant it!\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: SCENE 69: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nPERRAULT: Was there really any need for such rudeness, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m very much afraid there was. Adric was right, Perrault. Look at this.\nPERRAULT: The meteor. Well?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see?\nPERRAULT: No, Doctor, I’m afraid I don’t.\nDOCTOR: It’s not your fault — Adric has a particular facility for recognising mathematical simulations.\nPERRAULT: Simulations?\nDOCTOR: The meteor — its mass, its shape, it’s all wrong!\nPERRAULT: Doctor, there’s no time for this. The impact is imminent! I was hoping to have my friends about me-\nDOCTOR: It’s not on a collision course, it’s being piloted! The entire population of Zaltys have been duped. The meteor isn’t any sort of meteor at all!\nPERRAULT: Then for mercy’s sake, what is it?\nDOCTOR: Let’s find out.\nDOCTOR: If I can track back the alterations that have been made to the data, I can get some idea of what we ought to be looking at.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 104\nPERRAULT: How long will it take?\nDOCTOR: For any particularly talented programmer, a day or two. Hopefully, I’1ll have something within a few minutes.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR: SCENE 70: INT. EXEMPLAR — DUCTING\nTEGAN: You know what, Lusca?\nLUSCA: What?\nTEGAN: I think I just invented a new definition of irony: feeling like you’re going to suffocate inside a shaft designed for ventila-\nTEGAN: Not a sound!\nLUSCA: They’ve found us.\nTEGAN: They’ve only found us if they find us. Now keep quiet.\nCLARIMONDE: (D; OVER THE TANNOY) All crew, we are coming in to land!\nCLARIMONDE: Everyone to their stations!\nLUSCA: It’s gone.\nTEGAN: Did you hear that though, Lusca? It’s time!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 106\nLUSCA: Time to do what?\nTEGAN: Come on!\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 107\nTEGAN: SCENE 71: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nDOCTOR: Oh no. It’s the Exemplar!\nPERRAULT: The what?\nDOCTOR: I always wondered what became of them. Why couldn’t they have just died out?\nPERRAULT: I’m sorry, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: The crew of the Exemplar — they’re Necrobiologicals. Vampires, in common parlance.\nPERRAULT: I’m unfamiliar with either term.\nDOCTOR: Then Zaltys is extremely fortunate. Vampirism is a phase almost every inhabited world goes through. They’re an evolutionary cul-de-sac, unable to reproduce. They survive by consuming the blood of other beings.\nPERRAULT: Horrible!\nDOCTOR: I encountered this lot on the planet Sekhmet — about seven hundred years ago by your time, a couple of incarnations ago by mine. When the tide turned against them, they fled on a vast ship called the Exemplar — hundreds of them, simply vanished through an artificially-generated wormhole. That’s when I lost track of them.\nPERRAULT: Now they’re coming to Zaltys?!\nDOCTOR: Where the entire population is frozen, just waiting to be devoured!\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: SCENE 72: INT. EXEMPLAR — BRIDGE\nCLARIMONDE: History will remember this as the day the Exemplar made its mark upon the universe! Drink deep, my people.

But there are only a handful of us awake on the entire planet.

Were we expected to be cowering in fear now?\nGEVAUDAN: Well, the meteor is due-\nDOCTOR: (D) Ah yes, the fabled meteor!

ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: I’d say they were quite considerably ‘off’, wouldn’t you? But that was always the plan, wasn’t it? How long has this invasion been planned, hm? Certainly before Perrault found you drifting in space, apparently mortally wounded.\nGEVAUDAN: (D; OVER THE RADIO) What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: You preyed on the good nature of the people of Zaltys so the Necrobiologicals could literally prey on them now!\nGEVAUDAN: (D) What ‘Necrobiologicals’?\nDOCTOR: It’s too late for any more lies, Gevaudan, so why not be honest for a change?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 76: INT.

All of Zaltys has been duped — no small achievement.\nGEVAUDAN: There... is no meteor?\nDOCTOR: (D) Oh, just stop! Are all your race assisting the Vampires, or is it just you? The psychic abilities of the Necrobiologicals are the stuff of legend, but I never met a Vulpine capable of everything you’ve achieved.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 77: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Perrault thinks you must be some sort of mutation, and I’m inclined to agree. How else could you commune with the crew of the Exemplar?\nGEVAUDAN: (D) I have never even heard of the Exemplar, I give you my word!\nDOCTOR: Your word is worth surprisingly little to me!\nPERRAULT: I really think you’re being quite unfair, Doctor.

Where did you first meet them?\nPERRAULT: On one of my very rare diplomatic excursions — I have mentioned the planet Occhinos, haven’t I?\nDOCTOR: Impossible! Its suns are positioned in such a way that the entire planet’s in permanent daylight. It’s the very last place a light-sensitive race would— (BREAKS OFF: REALISATION) Oh.\nPERRAULT: The last place a light-sensitive race would settle, and therefore the last place anyone would think to look for them.\nDOCTOR: Again: very clever.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 114\nPERRAULT: Of course, with its natural disadvantages, Occhinos could never be anything more than a rest stop.\nDOCTOR: Seven hundred years?\nPERRAULT: A drop in the ocean to an immortal.\nDOCTOR: No-one’s truly immortal, Perrault. I mean: how could they have survived there for so long?\nPERRAULT: They were very frugal with their supplies. Every so often, they’d send out raiding parties in scout ships — like the ones who killed Gevaudan’s crew.\nDOCTOR: I see. And I suppose Zaltys’ underground cities make it the ideal power base.\nPERRAULT: The first of many, in a new empire of the undead.\nGEVAUDAN: (D; OVER THE RADIO) He’s lying, Doctor, he must be!\nPERRAULT: Gevaudan! I’d forgotten you were still there.\nPERRAULT: SCENE 80: INT.

If any of this were true, I would have sensed it.\nPERRAULT: (D) That was the most onerous part of the entire deception, shielding my thoughts from a telepath.\nGEVAUDAN: No-one on Zaltys has those kinds of gifts!\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 115\nGEVAUDAN: SCENE 81: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE (CONTINUOUS)\nPERRAULT: No ordinary person. I don’t know where my abilities came from, but I grasped very early on in life that I was far superior to my fellow man, and destined for greater things.\nDOCTOR: Like accomplice to genocide?\nPERRAULT: More like sustenance than genocide. This is simply the first stage, Doctor — an act of good faith on my part.\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 116\nPERRAULT: SCENE 82: INT.

There’s nothing I can do about that. There are bigger issues at stake at the present time. Your friend the Doctor seems to be the only one who knows what’s going on. Apart from Perrault, of course. I don’t suppose you have any sense of what’s going on in his mind?\nNYSSA: What? No, I’ve never experienced anything like this — not until your thoughts started appearing in my head.\nGEVAUDAN: You’re something quite special, Nyssa. Before today, I might have said unique.

If you imagine I’d have sacrificed my home planet to satisfy my wanderlust, you’re very much mistaken.\nPERRAULT: ‘My home planet’. A world of blinkered, wilful, xenophobic ignorants, like Talia. How dare they cut themselves off, cut me off from the rest of the universe? No — they deserve all that’s coming to them. When the Necrobiologicals seize Zaltys, I’1l have the entire universe at my disposal, and an infinite amount of time in which to experience it.\nDOCTOR: So that’s what they offered you — to convert you into one of their own!\nPERRAULT: I’m not a puppet, Doctor. This was a bargain struck by equals. Zaltys, in exchange for immortality!\nDOCTOR: As I said, Perrault, there’s no such thing as an immortal being.\nPERRAULT: Let’s discuss that in a few million years, shall we?\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 123\nPERRAULT: SCENE 86: INT. ZALTYS — DOME\nSABLE: I never thought I’d see the surface again.\nADRIC: I haven’t seen it ‘til now. I don’t much like it.\nSABLE: You’re not here to critique the landscape, you’re here to drive the TARDIS.\nADRIC: I don’t even know where it is.\nSABLE: I do. It’s a couple of miles south of this dome.\nADRIC: Look! That’s the ship I tried to tell the Doctor about!\nSABLE: (SIGHS) Life is just one challenge after another, innit?\nSABLE: SCENE 87: EXT. ZALTYS — LANDING POINT (CONTINUOUS)\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 124\nSABLE: SCENE 88: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE (CONTINUOUS)\nSABLE: GIGANTIC THUD.\nPERRAULT: Ah! See, Doctor? Our guests have arrived for dinner.\nDOCTOR: If I’d known they were coming, I’d have sharpened a stake.\nPERRAULT: There’s an entire army on board the Exemplar, I hardly think a Single stake will do you much good.\nDOCTOR: There are other ways to deal with a vampire, Perrault. Probably.\nPERRAULT: Think quickly, Doctor. They’re here, and they have a Significant grudge against you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think we still have a little bit of time left. How long are the days here on Zaltys? Feels like... twenty-nine hours?\nPERRAULT: So?\nDOCTOR: It won’t be dark for another three and a half hours, and since no-one aboard that ship can allow the smallest fragment of their skin to be touched by sunlight, I think there’s plenty of time to concoct a strategy.\nPERRAULT: Really? Then tell me, Doctor — why are they lowering the ramp?\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 125\nPERRAULT: SCENE 89: EXT. ZALTYS — OUTSIDE THE DOME\nADRIC: Give me the binoculars, I want to see!\nSABLE: Hands off, they’re mine.\nSABLE: Well, there’s something you don’t see every day.\nADRIC: What’s happening?\nSABLE: Given the way this day’s been going, nothing good. I see... People. I think. Hundreds of them. In spacesuits with tinted visors.\nSABLE: SCENE 90: EXT. ZALTYS — LANDING POINT\nSABLE: RAMP.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 126\nSABLE: SCENE 91: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, now I know how they survived for so long on Occhinos.\nPERRAULT: Hundreds of Necrobiologicals in sunlight-resistant suits, all thirsty for Gallifreyan blood. No time to think, Doctor.\nPERRAULT: No time at all. That must be very frustrating for a Time Lord.\nCLARIMONDE: (D; IN PERRAULT’S MIND) Perrault? Do you hear me, Perrault?\nPERRAULT: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Of course what? Oh, you’re speaking to Clarimonde. Is this a private conversation, or a party line?\nPERRAULT: Do be quiet, Doctor.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) The Doctor’s there, too? Make sure no harm comes to him, Perrault.\nPERRAULT: Is that really your command?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she’s commanding you now? I thought you two were in negotiations.\nCLARIMONDE: (D) I wish him unharmed so that I may harm him. Considerably. I shall be with you very soon. The moment of your transformation is at hand.\nPERRAULT: Yes! And then, together, we shall— Clarimonde? Are you there?\nDOCTOR: I always think it’s very rude when people hang up without saying goodbye, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 127\nPERRAULT: I was wrong about you, Doctor. I thought you of all people could comprehend my true majesty.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. To me, it looks as though you want to ascend to a level of importance you haven’t achieved.\nPERRAULT: Oh, I achieved it! From childhood, I was a god among insects.\nDOCTOR: Yes, this is starting to take a very familiar turn.\nPERRAULT: Mock all you like. But as the lifeblood is drained from your body, Doctor, I wish you to think on this: with the death of Zaltys, I shall be reborn as something greater still, a being with abilities unmatched in the universe. The plan I set in motion so many years ago has come to fruition exactly as I intended! I have left nothing whatsoever to ch-\nPERRAULT: (HIT) Aghh!\nTALIA: You shouldn’t have left me to chance, traitor.\nPERRAULT: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 128\nPERRAULT: SCENE 92: EXT. ZALTYS — OUTSIDE THE DOME\nADRIC: This is precisely what I was trying to warn everyone about!\nSABLE: Ooo..kay. They’re still a ways off. We can make it to the TARDIS if we hurry.\nADRIC: What about the others? We’re not going to leave them!\nSABLE: I got left behind, I think it’s past time I started doling out the same treatment.\nSABLE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 129\nSABLE: SCENE 93: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nTALIA: Is he dead?\nDOCTOR: Very much so, er.. Talia.\nTALIA: I heard. I heard everything.\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Feeling a little better, I hope?\nTALIA: Better than Perrault, anyway.\nDOCTOR: You shouldn’t try to get up.\nTALIA: Don’t touch me, alien.\nTALIA: CLOSES AGAIN.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nGEVAUDAN: Perrault’s dead. That’s a pity, I was rather hoping to kill him myself.\nTALIA: Wonderful. More aliens.\nGEVAUDAN: At this precise moment, Talia, the four of us are all that stands between the Necrobiologicals and the genocide of Zaltys.\nTALIA: (GRADUALLY LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS) I should shoot the lot of...\nDOCTOR: Unconscious again. Make that the three of us.\nNYSSA: Look at the screen! There are hundreds of them!\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 130\nGEVAUDAN: They’re heading for the dome. Doctor, I know Nyssa has complete trust in you. She’s never seen you fail.\nDOCTOR: In all fairness, Gevaudan, she hasn’t known me all that long.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR: SCENE 94: EXT. ZALTYS — CLOSE TO THE LANDING POINT\nCLARIMONDE: (INSIDE HER HELMET) No pushing, no rushing, and no breaking ranks! There’s an open bar, and more than enough for all of us!\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 132\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 95: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nNYSSA: Doctor, what can we do?\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing we can do, Nyssa. There is something I can do,\nDOCTOR: however.\nGEVAUDAN: What?\nDOCTOR: There’s a wormhole generator on board the Exemplar. If I can\nDOCTOR: reach the ship without being seen-\nGEVAUDAN: Impossible!\nDOCTOR: I can generate a wormhole to engulf the ship and the Necrobiologicals alike!\nNYSSA: A wormhole? Leading where?\nDOCTOR: Nowhere. Once it’s activated, I’1ll sabotage the equipment, strand the Exemplar outside space-time.\nGEVAUDAN: Stranding yourself along with it.\nDOCTOR: Alone with the vampires. Yes.\nNYSSA: Doctor, you can’t do that!\nDOCTOR: I can’t see any other way.\nNYSSA: But what about Tegan?\nDOCTOR: and\nDOCTOR: If the Necrobiologicals worked out that their new arrival was connected to me, there’s a chance that they’1ll have kept her alive. If that’s the case, I’1ll do my best to get her off the\nDOCTOR: Examplar, while there’s still time.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 133\nGEVAUDAN: There is no way you’1ll be able to avoid an oncoming force in their hundreds!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I can be surprisingly stealthy when I put my mind to it. Both of you, try and find Adric. You’1l need him to fly the TARDIS, heavens help you.\nNYSSA: Not a chance. Doctor, I’m coming with you.\nDOCTOR: Gevaudan...?\nGEVAUDAN: Of course. (GRABS NYSSA)\nNYSSA: (GRABBED) What? Let go of me, you..! — Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Nyssa. It’s for the best.\nNYSSA: Gevaudan, I need to help him!\nGEVAUDAN: There is no helping him.\nNYSSA: He'll die!\nGEVAUDAN: Yes. But not on the Exemplar. He’1ll try, but he won’t make it that far, not in time.\nNYSSA: Then you’re giving up on Zaltys?\nGEVAUDAN: No, I’m giving up on the Doctor.\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING FREE) Well, I won’t!\nGEVAUDAN: Nyssa, don’t go! Please! I know you believe in him, but he’s grasping at straws for your sake. There is one final option, however — attack on a telepathic level.\nGEVAUDAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 134\nNYSSA: Can you do that? Take on a whole army?\nGEVAUDAN: Alone, no. I don’t possess sufficient power to do that. But now I know that the Necrobiologicals took the lives of my pack, and my mate, I have to do it. With your assistance, I might have a chance.\nNYSSA: I don’t have any kind of psychic ability!\nGEVAUDAN: I think you may, even if you don’t know it. I’ve been aware of your power ever since you arrived on Zaltys. Nyssa, you can act as an amplifier for my own meagre talents.\nNYSSA: Gevaudan, it’s just not possible.\nGEVAUDAN: There’s nothing to be lost by trying, is there?\nNYSSA: (AFTER A PAUSE) What do you want me to do?\nGEVAUDAN: Simply... give me your mind...\nNYSSA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 135\nNYSSA: SCENE 96: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: Thank goodness for an infallible sense of direction — I’ll be able to go to my probable death even faster than I’d hoped.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa...? !\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR: SCENE 97: INT. CLARIMONDE’S MIND\nCLARIMONDE: What’s happening? Who’s there?\nGEVAUDAN: I am here. In your mind. In the minds of every one of your people.\nCLARIMONDE: I can’t see you. Who are you?\nGEVAUDAN: No-one. Everyone. I am myself, and I am every one of you.\nCLARIMONDE: If anyone else can hear this, try to shut him out!\nGEVAUDAN: There is no keeping me out. I am here ‘til the end. Did you think that you could drain the life from my pack and take nothing else from them? They are with you still, in the unaccessed portions of your minds, and I can destroy you through them.\nCLARIMONDE: You... you are Vulpine!\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 137\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 98: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nCLARIMONDE: THE DOCTOR ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, are you— (FORCED BACK, REELING) Oof!\nNYSSA: Doctor! It’s Gevaudan. He’s using my mind. It hurts!!!\nDOCTOR: Yes, he seems to have released a psychic wave of some kind.\nDOCTOR: can’t move! — Gevaudan, let Nyssa go! Gevaudan!\nAND: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 138\nAND: SCENE 99: INT. CLARIMONDE’S MIND\nGEVAUDAN: You shouldn’t have kept the ring, Clarimonde.\nCLARIMONDE: The ring?\nGEVAUDAN: You wear it on your finger. You took it from the dead hand of my mate. He and I bonded for eternity, not simply for a lifetime. The ring is now a focal point — of my love for him, and my hatred for you!\nCROSS TO: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 139\nCROSS TO: SCENE 100: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nNYSSA: (PAINED) I hear him, Doctor. He’s talking to a woman. To Clarimonde! I feel so much pain. (SNARLS, ALMOST POSSESSED) So much hatred...!\nDOCTOR: (STILL HELD BACK) Gevaudan! Let Nyssa go! This isn’t her fight!\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: SCENE 101: INT. CLARIMONDE’S MIND\nGEVAUDAN: You’ve travelled so far, Clarimonde.\nCLARIMONDE: Yes.\nGEVAUDAN: All of your kind, so far.\nCLARIMONDE: Yes.\nGEVAUDAN: Page 140\nGEVAUDAN: You have come to claim Zaltys as your own, and you must.\nCLARIMONDE: We shall.\nGEVAUDAN: All of Zaltys is yours.\nCLARIMONDE: What?\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 102: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nNYSSA: (AS IF POSSESSED, ECHOING GEVAUDAN) All of Zaltys of it.\nDOCTOR: Gevaudan, what are you doing...?\nDOCTOR: Page 14]\nDOCTOR: is yours. All\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: SCENE 103: INT. CLARIMONDE’S MIND\nCLARIMONDE: All of Zaltys. All of it.\nGEVAUDAN: The deepest caverns to the greatest peaks. All is yours.\nCLARIMONDE: All is ours.\nGEVAUDAN: Then you must claim it as your own.\nCLARIMONDE: As our own.\nGEVAUDAN: Pell. “Of 184\nCLARIMONDE: All’ Of: 2t..\nGEVAUDAN: So own this world. Remove your helmets. Feel its sunlight on your skin.\nCLARIMONDE: (UNSURE) No...\nGEVAUDAN: You must. This world will never be yours until you do.\nCLARIMONDE: No...! We must not. We must... must...\nCLARIMONDE: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 143\nCLARIMONDE: SCENE 104: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) Remove your helmets. Feel the sunlight on your skin.\nDOCTOR: So that’s what he’s up to— (REALISATION) They’1l die. Gevaudan, I beg you — let Nyssa go. The feedback will burn out her mind!

Why is it happening to them?\nADRIC: They can’t stand the daylight — just like in the book. ‘Look to the ones who shun the day.’\nSABLE: What book?\nADRIC: It doesn’t matter. Whatever’s happened here, you can bet the Doctor’s responsible for it somehow.\nADRIC: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 146\nADRIC: SCENE 107: INT. ZALTYS FACILITY — COMMAND CENTRE\nNYSSA: (COMING TO) Doctor...? Is it over?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Gevaudan released your mind, just in time.\nNYSSA: The people in spacesuits? The Necrobiologicals? They’re dead.\nDOCTOR: Turned to ash. You can see on the screen.\nNYSSA: Gevaudan, you did it! Gevaudan? (REALISATION) Doctor, he’s —\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid there was a price to be paid. All those minds, dying at once. Gevaudan took the full force of the psychic backlash.\nNYSSA: No... !\nDOCTOR: He gave his life for a world that’1ll probably never thank him.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR: SCENE 108: EXT. ZALTYS SHORELINE\nTEGAN: Now there’s a sight for sore eyes! The TARDIS!\nTEGAN: Really sore eyes, come to think of it. This planet’s colour scheme is just awful. It’s like living inside a David Bowie video.\nTEGAN: Home sweet home. (BEAT; SHE’S SURPRISED HERSELF) Did I really just say [that?]\nSABLE: Hey, you! I said you!!!\nTEGAN: Who the- Adric?!\nSABLE: Step away from the time capsule, lady.\nADRIC: Her name is Tegan. (TAKING IN TEGAN’S BATTERED APPEARANCE ) Tegan, what happened to you?\nTEGAN: Oh, you know, fell out of a spaceship, landed in a load of palm trees, nothing special. Who’s your friend?\nADRIC: She’s not my friend.\nTEGAN: I guessed that from the way she’s waving that gun around.\nSABLE: I said, step away. The TARDIS is mine now.\nTEGAN: Not a chance! It belongs to the Doctor.\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 148\nSABLE: The Doctor’s out of the picture. Just as well, if this is his idea of a stylish ride. Adric, open her up.\nADRIC: No! This has gone on long enough! You might as well shoot me because I’m never going to fly the TARDIS for you!\nSABLE: Okay, back to plan A.\nSABLE: Adric, open the door or Tegan’s a dead woman.\nTEGAN: Don’t do it, Adric!\nSABLE: Do it, Adric! I’ve got a gun and a low boredom threshold, and that’s a deadly combination.\nADRIC: No, Sable. I can’t let you take the TARDIS. I won’t.\nSABLE: Suit yourself. [Tegan, I guess it’s for the best I didn’t get to know you better. No hard feelings. ]\nSABLE: ACROSS THE SHORE TO THEM.\nTEGAN: I.. I don’t want to sound corny, but before you shoot me, you should probably look behind you.\nSABLE: You’re right, that is pretty corny. There’s nothing behind me but the sea.\nTEGAN: What if somebody came out of the sea?\nSABLE: Nice try, but I’m the only one here who came out of the sea.\nLUSCA: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 149\nSABLE: (POUNCED ON) Aaaah!\nTEGAN: Lusca! Knock the gun from her hand!\nSABLE: (STRUGGLING) Get off me, you scaly monster!\nLUSCA: (HIT, SNARLS) Ahh! (EFFORT) You... are the monster... I think! (DRAGGING SABLE INTO WATER — SPLASHING) You will come with me!\nSABLE: (DRAGGED INTO WATER — SPLASHING) Let me go...!\nLUSCA: Come with me! Into the water!\nSABLE: No! No — (WATER FILLS HER MOUTH)\nADRIC: They’ve gone under.\nTEGAN: It’s all right. Lusca’s going to be all right. The water makes her stronger.\nADRIC: But not invulnerable. You saw, Tegan. Sable shot her before she drowned, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Lusca? (LONG PAUSE) Lusca...?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 150\nTEGAN: SCENE 109: EXT. ZALTYS SHORELINE, LATER\nTEGAN: APPROACH THE TARDIS.\nTALIA: I still can’t believe that Gevaudan — an alien — gave his life to save the entire planet.\nDOCTOR: And another alien gave her life to save my friend Tegan. Makes you think, doesn’t it?\nTALIA: About what?\nNYSSA: Please, Talia, make sure the bodies of Lusca and Sable are\nNYSSA: returned to their people.\nTALIA: I’ll see to it myself.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. You know, you might just find your first trip off- planet illuminating.\nTALIA: Like Perrault did?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but you’re not Perrault.\nTALIA: How can you be so sure?\nDOCTOR: I’m a mind reader. Goodbye, Talia.\nTALIA: I won’t shake hands, if you don't mind.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Of course not. — Come along, Nyssa.\nDOCTOR: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 15]\nDOCTOR: SCENE 110: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM (CONTINUOUS)\nNYSSA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nNYSSA: What do you think, about what Gevaudan said?\nDOCTOR: What did Gevaudan say?\nNYSSA: He said I possessed telepathic powers.\nDOCTOR: It’s not impossible. But then, he’d never detected a Trakenite’s brainwaves before. If Trakenite brainwaves resonate on a similar frequency to Vulpine ones... they must have struck him like, like a particularly strong scent!\nNYSSA: Oh.\nDOCTOR: I daresay the belief that he’d found a fellow psychic really did give a boost to his own powers, though. The mind is a strange thing. The mind of a telepath, [even more so. ]\nDOCTOR: Ah, Tegan, Adric! I’m glad to have you both back with us. You both look — terrible, actually.\nTEGAN: That’s hardly surprising.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I think we should put as much distance between ourselves and Zaltys as possible.\nTEGAN: So that’s it? We just forget all about it, and it’s on to another adventure?\nTEGAN: #223: ZALTYS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: Did I say that?\nTEGAN: Lusca hardly knew me, but she died for me!\nDOCTOR: And would you have done the same for her?\nTEGAN: Yes, of course!\nDOCTOR: Then think on that. Someone pointed out to me very recently how frustrating it must be for a Time Lord to not have enough time. But on rare occasions, there is time. I suggest we all take it.\nNYSSA: Come on, Tegan. We could both do with a rest. — I wonder what became of the ion bonder?\nTEGAN: (COVERING) Oh, it’1ll probably turn up somewhere.\nADRIC: But I thought-\nTEGAN: Not a word.\nADRIC: Thank you for coming back for me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Did you really think I wouldn’t?\nADRIC: I thought you might be angry with me. For what happened with the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well... falling-outs are common. But I wouldn’t give up a valued member of my crew for anything. Remember, ‘omne trium perfectum’. ‘Everything that comes in threes is perfect’.\nADRIC: Except that, counting you, there’s four of us. That’s one too many. Isn’t it?"
