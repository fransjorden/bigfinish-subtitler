Tumbling down, I tell you! Some buildings lost whole storeys. Our people are working to prop up what's left of Pompeii, but the damage, the damage!\nMORAN: (BORED) I can see it must be frustrating for you, Professor.\nSCALINI: Frustrating? It’s disastrous! An archaeological disaster!\nSCALINI: Pompeii is our window on the Roman world, you know, Captain. A window! Thanks to the eruption of Vesuvius, this city was preserved like no other, just waiting for us to learn its secrets. It has survived looters, tourists, vandals... and now, for nature itself to do this...\nMORAN: I’m sure you're doing everything you can, Professor. THEY COME TO A HALT.\nMORAN: But this, 1 assume, is what we're here for.\nSCALINI: Yes, yes, this is the artefact. We haven’t completed our excavations of this region, you see. The artefact was uncovered by the earthquake. It —\nMORAN: Gould somebody have put it here? As some sort of prank?\nSCALINI: Oh, goodness, no. As you can see, it is still partially\nSCALINI: buried under volcanic ash. No, the only way it could have arrived in its present position is if it was placed there before Mount Vesuvius\nSCALINI: erupted.\nMORAN: Which was when, exactly?\nSCALINI: AD 79. Almost two thousand years ago — which, as you can see, is impossible. Quite impossible.\nMORAN: Indeed. OK, Professor, I’m taking custody of this\nMORAN: artefact. I'l have men down here within the hour.\nSCALINI: You intend to dig it out? But—\nMORAN: I have to ask you not to speak to anyone about this. You will be required to sign a declaration to that effect. A representative of your government will be in touch shortly.\nSCALINI: I don't understand.

The Roman Empire is under the short-lived rule of Titus. We are in the city of Pompeii, a prosperous trading centre on the Bay of Naples. If you look between the buildings over there, you can see a mountain by the name of Vesuvius.\nMEL: The volcano!\nDOCTOR: Yes. The voleano.\nMEL: I've never seen a real volcano before. (LAUGHS\nMEL: NOSTALGICALLY> I remember, we made a model of that particular one in primary school, out of papier mache.

Go back to the TARDIS.\nMEL: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because you aren't dressed for this time and place.\nDOCTOR: 167\nDOCTOR: Because, beneath their sophisticated veneer, the Romans are a quite barbarous people. Because we have a habit of attracting trouble. And because this is your history, and no good can come of our meddling in it.\nMEL: (SIGHS) It’s all right, Doctor. I get the idea. You want to gO.\nDOCTOR: No. It's your decision, Mel. It has to be your choice.\nMEL: Well... can't we at least have a quick look round first? I\nMEL: mean, there's no reason why we should go rushing straight off. is there?\nDOCTOR: None whatsoever.\nMEL: I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.\nDOCTOR: Nothing's wrong, Mel. Quite the opposite. Events are\nDOCTOR: proceenne precisely as I expect they should. And Mount Vesuvius? aa DOCTOR SETS OFF WALKING AGAIN.\nDOCTOR: (DOURLY) Will erupt, burying Pompeii and killing thousands of its people, at approximately midday tomorrow.\nMIX: INTO MUSIC\nMIX: 4, THE STREET OF PLENTY A FEW MINUTES LATER.

The Street of Plenty.\nMEL: There are certainly plenty of people about.\nDOCTOR: They're celebrating, Mel. If ] remember my history — or\nDOCTOR: rather. yours — correctly, we've arrived during the Festival of the Divine Augustus.\nMEL: I see they’ve invented graffiti by now. It’s everywhere!

I’m sorry, I don’t have any money.\nBEGGAR WOMAN: (ANGRILY) What? You dare claim poverty? You, with your clean face and your neat hair and your clothing of strange fabrics?\nMEL: I don't. Really, I just —\nBEGGAR WOMAN: You think yourself better than me, but you are no more than a base dissembler!\nBEGGAR WOMAN: MEL. I'd help you if I could. But I’ve only just arrived here. . I'm a messenger. From Isis. I’m here to —\nDOCTOR: To honour the Divine Augustus with a quiet drink.\nMEL: (RELIEVED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: So, if you’d excuse us...?\nMEL: Where were you?\nMEL: THE DOCTOR CHIVVIES MEL AWAY. WE STAY WITH THEM.\nBEGGAR WOMAN: (SHOUTS AFTER THEM) You have not even the decency to cover your head. You are shameless, woman. Shameless!\nDOCTOR: I don't think it’s a good idea to encourage that particular rumour.\nMEL: I don't like lying, obviously - but I didn’t know what\nMEL: else to say. We can't tell the people of the first century AD about the TARDIS, can we?\nDOCTOR: You should leave the talking to me in future.\nMEL: (OFFENDED) Oh, Doctor! I only repeated what you told that slave — or rather, what you let him believe.\nDOCTOR: He saw the TARDIS materialising. I had no choice.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, Mel, making claims of that nature can be very unwise indeed. You're drawing enough attention to us already.\nMEL: I'm drawing attention?\nDOCTOR: Your clothing is anachronistic. Women should keep their heads covered, and pink stripes are definitely out of season.\nMEL: Whereas question mark pullovers are the height of discretion, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: T think we should find somewhere a bit more private. THEY WALK AWAY FROM US, AND WE RETURN TO THE BEGGAR WOMAN. SHE IS APPROACHED BY POPIDIUS CELSINUS; HE IS TWENTY-SIX YHARS OLD; A WEAK MAN IN A POSITION OF POWER.\nCELSINUS: Well? What have you learned?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: That you must like the aspect of this stranger 4 good deal that you, (WITH MOCKING GRANDEUR) Popidius Celsinus of the municipal council, would pay for the favour of such as I.\nCELSINUS: You try my patience, woman. What did she tell you?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: A more precious secret, perhaps, than can be bought with the few coins you have promised.\nCELSINUS: I offer fair recompense for a simple deed, hag! Would you have me talk to the aediles and have you run out of this city?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: (AMUSED, TAUNTINGLY) I merely find it strange that you know not the answer to your question already.\nCELSINUS: Why say you that?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: The woman comes from Isis, decurione. She is a messenger of the goddess. Now, how can it be that you, of all in Pompeii, were not aware of that fact?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: 169\nBEGGAR WOMAN: 8. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN\nBEGGAR WOMAN: A SMALL BAR CROWDED WITH REVELLERS, SOME OF THEM DRUNK AND QUITE ROWDY. ITS FRONT IS OPEN TO THE STREET, SO THE SOUNDS FROM OUTSIDE CAN STILL BE HEARD.

Yes, yes, thank you, I think we will.\nVALERIA: THE DOCTOR, MEL AND VALERIA MOVE INTO THE BAR TOGETHER.\nMEL: Thank you. But I’m not his —\nDOCTOB: You keep an interesting establishment here, er...?\nVALEBRIA: Valeria, Hedone at your service. You are a stranger to\nVALEBRIA: Pompeii, but a man of good standing I can see. It will be Falernian wine for you, I’d wager. 1 ask but four asses for the drink of the emperors.\nDOCTOR: Very reasonable... Ah. But not just yet, I'm afraid. I appear to have left my coins at home.\nMEL: (EMBARRASSED) Oh, Doctor!\nVALERIA: (CICILY) Then perhaps you should fetch them, stranger,\nVALERIA: before you waste any more of my time.\nSHE: WALKS OFF.\nMEL: What was that you said about drawing attention?\nDOCTOR: (BITTERLY) Why are you humans so obsessed with money? (MUTTERS THOUGHTFULLY) Money, money, money...\nMEL: I don’t think it’s a good idea to eat here anyway. Those fish aren't even cooked. They’re rotting!\nDOCTOR: They're not for eating, Mel.\nMEL: So, what are they for?\nDOCTOR: Throwing back into the river.\nMEL: I think it’s a bit late for that.\nDOCTOR: It’s a ritual, Mel. Remember what that slave told us?\nDOCTOR: Today is the Vulcanalia. The fish are an offering to Vulcan, the Roman God of Fire and Furnaces. (MUTTERS THOUGHTFULLY) I always did wonder how that particular custom originated.\nDOCTOR: MEL. You mean it’s Vulcan's feast day as well as the Festival\nDOCTOR: of the Divine Augustus? I knew the Romans had a lot of holidays, but two at once!\nDOCTOR: They treat their gods very seriously.\nMEL: As a serious excuse to get drunk, from what I can see. peehhny CHAPPILY) Ah! I think I’ve just seen the answer to our problem.\nMEL: HE LEADS MEI, OVER TO A TABLE AT WHICH FOUR PEOPLE ARE PLAYING WITH DICE MADE OUT OF BONE. ONE IS MURRANUS, A\nGLADIATOR: LOUD, ARROGANT AND QUICK TO ANGER. WE MUST ae VOICES OF AIL FOUR AS THEY PLAY.\nGLADIATOR: (LOWERS HER VOICE, UNEASILY) Are you sure, Doctor? mee. don’t look very friendly.\nDOCTOR: (AT NORMAL SPEAKING VOLUME) Gladiators, I expect. But don’t worry, Mel, they’re only wielding dice, not swords. Excuse me, ee I wonder if you might be able to accommodate one more player’\nDOCTOR: 170\nMURRANUS: You have coins to stake?\nDOCTOR: Ah, no. But I thought you might have a use for... (HE\nELONGATES: ‘FOR' AS HE RUMMAGES THROUGH HIS POCKETS) this silver, er... (DISAPPOINTED) yo-yo. No, no, that won’t do at all, will it? MURRANUS. We play for coins or nought. Now, leave. You disturb us.\nMEL: I think he means it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, but there must be something I can interest you\nDOCTOR: in.\nMURRANUS: (LAUGHS) I am Murranus, stranger, the greatest mirmillo ever to do battle in Pompeii's Amphitheatre. What could you offer to me?\nDOCTOR: (FEIGNING DELIGHT) Ah, Murranus! Delighted to meet you. I’ve heard your name spoken, of course. The most courageous swordsman in the whole of the Empire, they tell me.\nMEL: Much braver than Polycarbus.\nMURRANUS: You hear right. Why, in the latest games, I vanquished my opponents with ease. Even Crescens, ‘the people’s darling’ could not withstand my sword.\nMURRANUS: THE DOCTOR PULLS BACK A CHAIR AND SITS DOWN.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. And it would be a great honour to dice with the renowned Murranus. I’m the Doctor, by the way.\nMURRANUS: (THREATENINGLY) I did not give you leave to sit.\nDOCTOR: (HE'S SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF SOMETHING) My maidservant!\nMURRANUS: What madness afflicts you now?\nDOCTOR: My maidservant. She must be worth... oh, two thousand sesterces at least, wouldn't you say?\nMURRANUS: The girl?\nMEL: (HALF-LAUGHING, NOT SURE IF HE'S JOKING) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: The girl! What’s wrong, Murranus? My wager too rich for Pompeii's finest warrior? I will stake the girl against just thirty sesterces,\nMURRANUS: Then you are a fool, Doctor. You must know the gods will favour he who fights and wins in their\nMURRANUS: name.\nDOCTOR: Then you accept?\nDOCTOR: MEL; CIN AN URGENT WHISPER) I hope you know what you're doing.\nMURRANUS: Aye, Doctor. I accept!\nDOCTOR: ‘ Splendid, splendid. Well, then... perhaps you’d like to make the first roll?\nDOCTOR: 6. THE HOUSE OF EUMACHIA EUMACHIA, AN ARROGANT NOBLEWOMAN, REMONSTRATES WITH\nHER: SLAVE.\nEUMACHIA: (ANGRILY) Speak, slave! I require an answer. I would know how it is that you should take so long about a simple errand.\nSLAVE: (AFRAID) Forgive me, Mistress Eumachia, I am pledged Not to say.\nEUMACHIA: To whom? To whom would you show greater fealty than to your mistress; to she who feeds and clothes and houses you?\nEUMACHIA: Vi\nSLAVE: Only to the gods, I swear it.\nEUMACHIA: Ah! Then ‘twas the Gods who obstructed your work. Were my husband still alive, he would flog you for such lies!\nSLAVE: It was... (MUMBLES, ALMOST INAUDIBLY) their messengers.\nBUMACHIA: Do not mumble so!\nBUMACHIA: SLAVE. Their messengers, mistress. It is the truth, I swear it. I\nBUMACHIA: would scarce have believed it myself, and yet I saw their temple as it descended from the heavens.\nEUMACHIA: What temple is this, that a priestess of the true religion knows nought of it?\nSLAVE: It was sent to us by Isis, mistress.\nEUMACHIA: Ha! The foreign goddess! Then these messengers be false prophets indeed.\nSLAVE: My lady?\nEUMACHIA: Their deceptions may fool one such as you — but they will not long stand in the light of the true faith.\nEUMACHIA: '?. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN\nEUMACHIA: A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS HAS GATHERED, AND THE BAR IS QUIETER\nTHAN: BEFORE. TWO BONE DICE ROLL ACROSS A TABLE, AND A\nCOLLECTIVE: GASP IS RAISED.\nDOCTOR: I believe we agreed on thirty sesterces?\nMURRANUS: (BITTERLY) By Jupiter, Doctor, the Lares smile upon you today.\nDOCTOR: Apparently so. HE PULLS A NUMBER OF COINS ACROSS THE TABLE. THE ONLOOKERS BEGIN TO RESUME THEIR CONVERSATIONS.\nDOCTOR: And now, if you'll excuse me...?\nMURRANUS: What is this? Surely you will not take your gains and leave so soon?\nDOCTOR: Well, time is pressing.\nMURRANUS: (THREATENINGLY) That is not the way of a sportsman, Doctor. ] would test your fortune further. You will agree, I feel sure, that I should have the opportunity to recover what I have lost?\nDOCTOR: Oh, very well then, just a little longer... (CALLS) Valeria? Valeria, I wonder if you could do me a small favour? I’m sure you've noticed how my, ah, maidservant here is dressed. Most inappropriate. I wonder if you could, ah...? HE HANDS SOME COINS OVER.\nVALERIA: For this price, Doctor, I will clothe the girl in the finest robes. WE FOLLOW VALERIA AS SHE MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD TO AGLAE, A SHY GREEK TEENAGER.\nVALERIA: I have one more task for you, Aglae. Take these coins to Vesonius and purchase a stola for the Doctor’s maidservant. I would say she has your build.\nVALERIA: a But, my lady, it is the Festival. My mistress expects my return.\nVALERIA: You will do as I say, girl. Asellina will not miss you for\nVALERIA: a few minutes more.\nVALERIA: 172\nAGLAE: (COWED) As you wish.\nVALERIA: MOVES AWAY. AGLAE MAKES FOR THE DOOR, BUT MEL INTERCEPTS HER.\nMEL: Hello. You’re Aglae, aren't you? I’m Melanie Bush - Mel to my friends. I'd like to come with you, if I may.\nAGLAE: (SURPRISED) Will your master allow you to leave his side?\nMEL: ‘You must be joking! Anyway, he seems to have other\nMEL: things on his mind at the moment - and I’m attracting just as much attention here as I would be outside. So, let's go!\nMEL: HEADS FOR THE STREET, AND AGLAE FOLLOWS.\nAGLAE: (GIGGLING) I will enjoy your company, Mel.\nMEL: Well, there’s nothing like a bit of shopping to relax, is there?\nMEL: &. THE STREET OF PLENTY / THE LUPANAR MEL AND AGLAF APPROACH US IN MID-CONVERSATION.\nAGLAE: And you say this Doctor has... changed since you met him?\nMEL: (LAUGHING) Oh Aglae, you don’t know the half of it.\nMEL: CWISTFULLY) I was beginning to think he didn’t need me any more — but, since we arrived in Pompeii, he’s been acting very strangely. All quiet and brooding. It’s not like him at all. I wish he’d tell me what's wrong.\nAGLAE: You are a very compassionate woman, Mel.\nMEL: (TOUCHED) Oh, I just try to help when I can. THEY STOP OUTSIDE A BUILDING.\nMEL: So, this is where you live, is it?\nAGLAE: Yes, this is the Lupanar.\nMEL: It’s nice and central — right on the Street of Plenty.\nAGLAE: We do good trade. Come inside, Mel. You may change in\nAGLAE: my room. With luck, my lady Asellina will have no need of me for a time yet.\nMEL: Thanks, Aglae. What did you call this toga thing again — a stela? (BEAT) Hey, just a minute!\nAGLAE: What is it, Mel?\nMEL: Those... those things up there. On the sign. They can’t be what I think they are... C(UNCERTAINLY) can they?\nAGLAE: (PUZZLED) As you say, Mel, it is a sign. It bespeaks the nature of the Lupanar.\nMEL: But they look like... (WITH AN EMBARRASSED LAUGH)\nMEL: well, I don’t really like to say... they... CREALISES) Oh. Oh, does that mean you're a...? Oh.\nAGLAE: Do you not also serve your master in this manner?\nMEL: I most certainly do not! And you shouldn't - (BHAT, THEN GROANS) Oh no! Don’t look now, Aglae, but there’s that man again: the one who was watching me before. I think he’s coming over here.\nAGLAE: (GASPS) Mel, that is Popidius Celsinus. He is a decurione: a member of the municipal council.\nMEL: I don’t really care, actually. Let’s just get inside.\nMEL: 173\nAGLAE: But Mel, you should be honoured that he seeks you out.\nMEL: J can do without that particular honour, thank you. ‘MEL PULLS AGLAE INTO THE LUPANAR AND SLAMS THE DOOR. (LAUGHS HOLLOWLY) Oh, wonderful! Just wonderful!\nAGLAE: Does something vex you?\nMEL: (SIGHS) No, Aglae, not really. It’s just that the local creep makes a beeline for me, so what do I do? Run straight into the nearest brothel! Talk about giving somebody the wrong idea!\nMEL: 9. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN THE DICE ROLL. MURRANUS’S THREE FRIENDS LAUGH UNKINDLY.\nMURRANUS: (MOCKINGLY Once more, Doctor, you throw the caniculae. The fates have truly deserted you.\nDOCTOR: As you said, Murranus, the gods favour those who honour them in battle.\nMURRANUS: GATHERS UP HIS COINS. THE DOCTOR PUSHES BACK HIS CHAIR AND STANDS.\nMURRANUS: And now, I really must bid you good day.\nMURRANUS: Hold!\nDOCTOR: You have won all my coins, Murranus.\nMURRANUS: Thirty sesterces did you take from me. A mere ten have you staked in return.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. Well, I had to buy clothes for my companion, you see.\nMURRANUS: (THREATENINGLY) You will find something to wager! If you have nought else, then the clothes from your back may fetch an as or two.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they would. But —\nMURRANUS: (HAGERLY) Better yet, I should like another chance at winning your servant.\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid that was a one-time-only offer, Murranus. And, as you said, my luck really isn’t holding out. Your, ah, skill with the dice is a little too great for my liking.\nMURRANUS: JUMPS TO HIS FEET AND UNSHEATHES HIS SWORD.\nMURRANUS: (LOUDLY AND ANGRILY) Do you accuse Murranus of cheating? I will run you through where you stand!\nSILENCE: FALLS.\nDOCTOR: (CUNFLUSTERED) It’s all in the wrist action, of course. No point in having a loaded die if you don’t know how to roll it properly. But don't worry, I shan’t hold a grudge. I just wish to find my companion —\nMURRANUS: HURLS THE TABLE ASIDE TO GET TO THE DOCTOR. THE\nSILENCE: IS BROKEN, AS ONLOOKERS REACT WITH FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT.\nMURRANUS: You seem well versed in the ways of the cheat, Doctor. Could it be that it is you who have won your coins unfairly?\nVALERIA: INTERCEDES.\nVALERIA: (FORCEFULLY, AFRAID) Stop this, gentlemen!\nMURRANUS: It will stop when I have satisfaction, not before! THE DOCTOR PUSHES A CHAIR OVER AND RUNS. MURRANUS LEAPS ON HIM, SNARLING. WE HEAR GRUNTS AND GROANS FROM BOTH AS\nMURRANUS: 174\nMURRANUS: A SCUFFLE ENSUES.\nVALERIA: (SHOUTS) I will not have this brawling in my inn, do you hear?\nVALERIA: THE DOCTOR GASPS AS MURRANUS GETS AN ARM AROUND HIS NECK.\nMURRANUS: Worry not, Valeria. This imp will trouble us no more — not once I have crushed the life from his body!\nMURRANUS: A STRANGULATED CRY FROM THE DOCTOR.\nMURRANUS: 10. THE LUPANAR/THE STREET OF PLENTY MEL AND AGLAE CLATTER DOWN A FLIGHT OF WOODEN STAIRS.\nMEL: Am I wearing this the right way round? It’s not very comfortable.\nAGLAE: You should not wear your old garments beneath the stola, Mel.\nMEL: I don't want to lose them.\nAGLAE: At least you will draw less attention now. If fortune\nAGLAE: favours you, then Popidius Celsinus will not spy you again.\nAGLAF: OPENS THE DOOR ONTO THE STREET OF PLENTY. THEY EMERGE TO FIND THE CROWD SILENT, APART FROM A FEW AWE-\nSTRUCK: GASPS AND MURMURS.\nMEL: What's happening out here?\nAGLAE: I do not...CEXCITEDLY) Oh! Oh, look Mel! Look over there!\nMEL: CIN A HORRIFIED WHISPER) Vesuvius!\nAGLAE: Is it not magnificent? Smoke rises from the very mountain. It ean only have come from the furnace of Vulcan himself.\nMEL: (TO HERSELF, NUMBLY) The God of Fire and Furnaces. Oh no...\nMEL: A DISTANT RUMBLING STARTS UP. IT GROWS LOUDER.\nAGLAE: He acknowledges Pompeii’s offerings to him. Perhaps we are not so out of favour with the gods as we have feared.\nMEL: No. No, it can't be. Not yet. (BEAT; THEN, WORRIED)\nMEL: Aglae... Aglae, something’s happening. THE CROWD REACTS AS THE RUMBLING GROWS LOUDER STILL AND THE HEARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE.\nMEL: Aglae! (PANIC) 11, VALERLA HEDONE’S INN THE TREMOR CONTINUES. POTS SMASH ON THE FLOOR. PEOPLE\nREACT: FEARFULLY, AS ON THE STREET. THE DOCTOR BREAKS FREE.\nMURRANUS: (A GRUNT OF PAIN AND SURPRISE)\nDOCTOR: (A GASP OF RELIEF)\nMURRANUS: FALLS ONTO A TABLE AND BREAKS IT.\nMURRANUS: pOocTOR: (A LITTLE SHAKILY) Oh dear, you seem to have slipped.\nVALERIA: Enough, I say! Is it not trial enough that the earth\nVALERIA: betrays us, without that you continue this behaviour?\nMURRANUS: (FURIOUSLY) Confound you, cheat! The gods themselves keep me from snapping your neck — but they will not save you twice.\nVALERIA: You! Get out of here, now!\nVALERIA: 175\nDOCTOR: Delighted to.\nVALERIA: Go on, run! (WARNINGLY) No, Murranus, I care not about your reputation. If you wish to settle your differences, then you will find a place other than mine in which to do it, or you will settle them with mel\nMURRANUS: I shall do just that, once this infernal tremor has ended.\nMURRANUS: 12. THE STREET OF PLENTY THE TREMOR CONTINUES, PROBABLY FRIGHTENING A HORSE OR Two.\nAGLAE: (SHOUTS, IN A STRAINED VOICE) Be not afraid, Mel. Hold on to me. This earth tremor is not such a bad one, I think. It will soon end.\nMEL: (SAME) You mean this happens a lot?\nAGLAE: It is the gods’ way of showing us their displeasure. THE QUAKE SUBSIDES. PEOPLE PICK THEMSELVES UP, WITH A\nGENERAL: OUTPOURING OF RELIEF.\nGENERAL: You see? There has been no real damage. This was but a warning. We shall have to honour our gods more diligently.\nMEL: You're not making sense, Aglae. A minute ago, you were telling me how pleased Vulcan was with you. Now you're saying the gods are angry?\nAGLAE: It is true, I fear, that the earth shakes more often and more violently these past weeks. None can remember such ill omens since the upheaval of seventeen years since.\nMEL: Then why doesn't somebody do something? Doesn't anyone realise what's happening?\nAGLAE: We observe the rituals, we make offerings, we pray to be\nAGLAE: forgiven. What else can we do?\nMEL: IS DUMBFOUNDED. THEN THE DOCTOR BREEZES PAST.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there you are, Mel. Yes, very fetching. Thank you for your help, Aglae. Come along, Mel.\nMEL: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: CHE HAS PASSED HER NOW; HE CALLS BACK) There are at least two very good reasons why we ought to be somewhere else.\nMEL: (CALLS BACK) Wait for me then. (TO AGLAE) Well, er...\nMEL: thank you for everything, Aglae. It’s been lovely meeting you, but it really does look like I’ve got to go.\nAGLAE: T understand, Mel. Your master has need of you.\nMEL: (SIGHS) Something like that.\nMEL: 13. A POMPEIAN STREET IN A QUIETER AREA, MEL CATCHES UP WITH THE DOCTOR.\nMEL: MEL, It’s the volcano, isn’t it, Doctor? Causing the tremors? (HE DOESN'T ANSWER) It’s horrible! This city... these people... Aglae! Valeria! They’re all going to die, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: Many of them, yes.\nMEL: Can’t we do something?\nDOCTOR: Against Nature? No. Against Time? Certainly not. This\nDOCTOR: happened a long time ago, Mel. We can't change it.\nDOCTOR: 176\nMEL: It doesn’t seem fair.\nDOCTOR: Time never is. THEY COME TO A HALT. (GENTLY) Are you ready to leave now?\nMEL: (THINKS CAREFULLY, THEN) Yes. Yes, I think I am.\nMEL: 13A, VALERIA HEDONES INN\nVALERIA: GREETS MURRANUS AS HE RETURNS.\nVALERIA: Murranus! So, you did not find your foe?\nMURRANUS: (BITTERLY) I did not. This is your fault, Valeria. You should not have kept me from him\nVALERIA: You have caused enough damage here you and the gods between you. I hope you have returned to help put things aright.\nMURRANUS: I will do that, Valeria. And I will put things right with this Doctor also. If he has any wit about him, he will leave Pompeii before I can find him for I swear he will not have the chance after.\nMURRANUS: 14. A POMPELAN BACK STREET\nMURRANUS: A FEW PEOPLE MILL ABOUT AND TALE IN CONCERNED TONES.\nHEAVY: STONES ARE BEING SHIFTED. THE DOCTOR AND MEL APPROACH.\nMEL: ...SO, you did cheat, then?\nDOCTOR: Only on that first roll. I observed our gladiator friend’s technique and used it — and his own dice against him,\nDOCTOR: MEL. (WITH MOCK DISAPPROVAL) Well, it sounds like cheating to me.\nDOCTOR: It’s only cheating if you get caught.\nMEL: Whereas you got clean away with it, I suppose. Well, if you want to know what I think — (SEES SOMETHING AND IS SUDDENLY WORRIED) Doctor... Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: (MURMURS, UPSET) No. No, this can't be how it ends. THEY RUN FORWARDS TOGETHER.\nMEL: We are in the right place. I know we’re in the right place.\nDOCTOR: I should have known. We should have turned back as soon as I realised..\nMEL: It was the earthquake, wasn't it? It brought that building down, and the TARDIS... the TARDIS was right underneath it!\nDOCTOR: ..but how could 1? Time marching on. The future laid\nDOCTOR: out before me. We’ve already stayed a lifetime.\nMEL: Doctor, tell me we can get the TARDIS back. I mean, it’s just a bit of concrete, right? Look - those slaves are already clearing the wreckage. We can dig it out, can’t we? We can get away before.. before...\nDOCTOR: [I’m sorry, Mel.\nDOCTOR: HE WALKS AWAY SLOWLY. MEL HESITATES FOR A SECOND, STUNNED, THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.\nMEL: Now wait a minute! What do you mean, you're ‘sorry’? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: It's Time, don’t you see? Time, working against us.\nDOCTOR: 177\nMEL: No. No, I don't see. What's wrong with you?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry for dragging you into this, Mel. I should have known. I did know. I found out a long time ago.\nMEL: Found out what? (HE DOESN’T ANSWER) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen the future, Mel. I know what will happen.\nDOCTOR: What must happen. (HE COLLECTS HIMSELF AND EXPLAINS) In the year 1980, the TARDIS will be discovered. Dug out of the ash that will rain upon this city tomorrow.\nMEL: (SHOCKED) You don’t mean...?\nDOCTOR: We can’t escape it, Mel. No matter what we do, Time already knows. We've already lost.\nMEL: But —\nDOCTOR: We won't see the TARDIS again. Nobody will see it. Not\nDOCTOR: for almost two thousand years.\nEND: PART ONE\nEND: 178"

(HE DOESN’T ANSWER) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I've seen the future, Mel. I know what will happen.\nDOCTOR: What must happen. (HE COLLECTS HIMSELF AND EXPLAINS) In the year 1980, the TARDIS will be discovered. Dug out of the ash that will rain upon this city tomorrow.\nMEL: (SHOCKED) You don't mean...?\nDOCTOR: We can’t escape it, Mel. No matter what we do, Time already knows. We’ve already lost.\nMEL: But -\nDOCTOR: We won't see the TARDIS again. Nobody will see it. Not for alinost two thousand years.\nMEL: I don’t understand. What are you talking about, Doctor?\nMEL: Two thousand years... How can you know that? Doctor? HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER. Doctor! Where are you going?\nMEL: 1S. A POMPEIAN STREET\nMEL: THE DOCTOR HAS WANDERED TO A FAIRLY BUSY AREA. MEL\nCATCHES: UP TO HIM AND TACKLES HIM. THEY KEEP WALKING TOGETHER, LEAVING THE SOUNDS OF THE BUILDING SITE BEHIND THEM.\nMEL: I wish you’d talk to me, Doctor. (BEAT) Well? Come\nMEL: on, Doctor! You knew we'd lose the TARDIS, didn’t you? How did you know?\nDOCTOR: (SUBDUED, DISTANT) It was a long time ago, Mel. I was in my... fifth body, I think. I visited your world — this world — in the early nineteen-eighties. I was contacted by an organisation called UNIT.\nDOCTOR: They're a —\nMEL: I know who UNIT are, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Of course you do, of course... (BHAT) They'd found my\nDOCTOR: TARDIS. In Italy. An earthquake had revealed it, beneath the volcanic ash that covered Pompeii. Only my TARDIS was still sitting at Hyde Park Corner, where I'd left it.\nMEL: They’d found your TARDIS - but it was the TARDIS from the future, right? I mean, from the past... No, hold on, I mean -\nDOCTOR: It’s one of the perils of time travel, Mel. I was given a\nDOCTOR: glimpse of the one thing no one should ever see. My personal future. My destiny. Perhaps my own death.\nMEL: Death?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Mel. I didn’t want to know. The UNIT people had taken the TARDIS into storage. I refused to see it. The less I knew about the circumstances in which I was fated to lose it, the better. But I couldn't forget what I had already learned.\nMEL: That the TARDIS would end up buried here.\nMEL: 179\nDOCTOR: I didn’t know that for sure, There were other\nDOCTOR: possibilities.\nMEL: Such as?\nDOCTOR: That UNIT hadn’t found the TARDIS at all, but rather\nDOCTOR: some sort of replica. That it may have found itself beneath the ash in some other way. I even considered that, one day, I might have chosen — might choose — to retire to your world, in this time. I might abandon my ship here in Pompeii, expecting it not to be seen again. I pushed my suspicions to the back of my mind, Mel. The important thing was that I didn’t know for certain what the future had in store.\nDOCTOR: MEL. Until we landed here, the day before the eruption of Vesuvius.\nDOCTOR: And then I knew. (A LONG, REFLECTIVE PAUSE) The\nDOCTOR: old girl tried to keep it from me, to protect me. (LAUGHS BITTERLY) She hates farewells as much as I do.\nMEL: That’s what I still don’t understand. If you knew — or even suspected - that we might lose the TARDIS here, then why didn't you do something? (HE DOESN’T ANSWER; SUSPICIOUSLY) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think we should find somewhere to have a proper talk\nDOCTOR: 16, OUTSIDE THE BATHS\nEUMACHIA: WAITS FOR CHELSINUS ON A BUSY STREET.\nEUMACHIA: Popidius Celsinus!\nCELSINUS: (STARTLED) Eumachia!\nEUMACHIA: I sent in a slave to fetch you.\nCELSINUS: I sent him away. Can a man not take his bath in peace?\nEUMACHIA: The afternoon has near gone while I have waited for you to bathe, decurione. Had you idled longer, I would have come into the tepidarium in search of you, men’s hours or not.\nCELSINUS: You have no sense of decorum, Eumachia.\nEUMACHIA: And ‘tis clear that you have no sense of responsibility. Are you unconcerned with the events of the day? Have you not heard of the arrivals in our city?\nCELSINUS: I saw a fair young stranger What of it?\nEUMACHIA: And does this woman claim to have come from your goddess?\nCELSINUS: What does it concern you? You have no love for Isis,\nEUMACHIA: And she has no love for you, so the rumours have it.\nCELSINUS: (ANNOYED AND A LITTLE ALARMED) Of what rumours do you speak?\nEUMACHIA: (ENJOYING THIS) Had you spent more time abroad this aft, you would have seen the writings yourself. The citizens ask how it is that Isis should send her messengers to Pompeii and yet they do not visit her temple, nor seek out he who takes credit for it.\nCELSINUS: Isis well knows how I rebuilt her temple, after it was felled by the earthquake.\nEUMACHIA: Ha! Your father paid for it to be built in your name, when you were but a child of nine. He bought you a future, and your seat on the Curia,\nCELSINUS: CANGRILY) I have earned the goddess’s favour!\nCELSINUS: 180\nEUMACHIA: Then should you not know why she spurns you?\nCELSINUS: If you seek to turn me against Isis, Eumachia, then it will profit you nought.\nEUMACHIA: That you worship the foreign deity of the lower classes says much of you, Celsinus — but I do not seek to question your faith. CELSINUS. No. But you would denounce these messengers.\nEUMACHIA: Test them, perhaps. I am not so proud, decurione, that I could not be persuaded yet to welcome your Isis into my heart.\nCELSINUS: I doubt our loving goddess could stand to enter that shrivelled chamber.\nEUMACHIA: ‘Tis rather you who has reason to disprove these strangers’ claims, I think. For, if they hold, then all will know that your goddess disdains you, Celsinus. What price your position, or your father’s wealth, then?\nCELSINUS: (AFTER A LONG, THOUGHTFUL PAUSE) What would you have me do?\nCELSINUS: 17. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN’ THE DOCTOR AND MEL HAVE JUST ENTERED. VALERIA IS SERVING.\nVALERIA: By rights, Doctor, I should not serve you. I want no more trouble.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then we’re agreed. And, er, Murranus...?\nVALERIA: He has gone. But I would place scant value on your life,\nVALERIA: should he return ~ especially when he espies the fresh writings on my wal.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so 1 see. “The mighty Murranus was outfought by...”\nMEL: Go on. What does it say?\nVALERIA: “By a mightier dwarf.”\nMEL: (LAUGHS) Oh, Doctor!\nVALERIA: (WITH A SIGH OF RESIGNATION) Well, I expect the mirmillo has returned to his barracks by now, to sleep off his libations.\nDOCTOR: Excellent! In that case, I shall have two cups of your ordinary wine please, Valeria.\nMEL: Do you think it’s a good idea to be drinking, Doctor?\nVALERIA: STARTS TO POUR THEIR DRINKS.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid they don’t serve carrot juice, Mel. Don't worry, the wine will be diluted with water, honey and... (WORRIED) Ah.\nMEL: What’s wrong?\nDOCTOR: Coins. I appear to be rather short again.\nMEL: (RELIEVED) As the graffiti says. Here, Doctor. Change\nMEL: from the clothes.\nSHE: HANDS A FEW COINS TO THE DOCTOR, AS VALERIA PUSHES TWO\nCUPS: ACROSS THE BAR\nVALERIA: A mere two asses if you please, Doctor. THE DOCTOR HANDS THE COINS OVER.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Valeria. Come along, Mel, I see a table.\nDOCTOR: THEY MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD, PULL BACK CHAIRS AND SIT DOWN. THERE IS A SHORT PAUSE.\nMEL: All right then, Doctor. I’m waiting.\nDOCTOR: It’s difficult, Mel.\nMEL: Well, ’i try to understand.\nMEL: 181\nDOCTOR: ‘As soon as I realised where we were, I knew what was likely to happen. I wanted to leave, but I couldn’t.\nMEL: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because the loss of the TARDIS, its excavation in\nDOCTOR: 1980... it’s all part of history.\nMEL: How can it be, if it hasn’t happened yet?\nDOCTOR: It will happen, Mel.\nMEL: But there’s still time to stop it.\nDOCTOR: No. I've already seen it. We can’t stop it.\nMEL: What if we'd just dematerialised as soon as you realised where we were? That would have changed things, wouldn't it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. But think, Mel. If I'd done that - if ’'d used my\nDOCTOR: foreknowledge to alter events — what do you think would have happened?\nMEL: Well, the TARDIS wouldn't have been buried, for a start.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. The TARDIS wouldn't have been buried. It wouildn’t have been dug up in two thousand years’ time. I wouldn't have been told of its discovery, and IJ would have arrived in Pompeii without any foreknowledge.\nMEL: So, you’d have acted as normal, left the TARDIS behind and... and it would have been buried?\nDOCTOR: Time cannot abide a paradox.\nMEL: No, neither can my brain. So, what you're saying is, we've just got to accept what’s happening? We can’t even try to get out of here?\nDOCTOR: I’m saying that history has already taken account of our actions — and it’s shown us their outcome.\nANOTHER: TREMOR, MUCH SHORTER AND LESS VIOLENT THAN THE LAST. CUPS RATTLE, AND THERE ARE MURMURS OF CONCERN.\nANOTHER: We can’t cheat Time, Mel. A LONG PAUSE, DURING WHICH THE TREMOR SUBSIDES.\nMEL: (WITH FRESH DETERMINATION) No. No, I’m sorry Doctor, I can't accept that.\nDOCTOR: Please listen to me, Mel.\nMEL: (SHE STANDS UP) You might think you know what's going to happen in the future, but all I know is that we aren’t beaten yet. I mean, what if UNIT were wrong? Or... or what if the TARDIS will end up in Pompeii one day but just not yet?\nDOCTOR: CIMPLORING) Mel!\nMEL: Tm going to find a way out of this, whatever it takes. Are you coming with me or not?\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry.\nMEL: (SIGHS) So am I. But I can’t give up, Doctor... even if you can.\nSHE: MARCHES OFF, DETERMINEDLY.\nSHE: 18.

My mistress has been kind to me.\nMEL: By making you sell yourself?\nEUMACHIA: I gave you an order, girl.\nAGLAE: (WEEPING OPENLY) I must not see you again, Mel. You will bring the gods’ just punishment down on us both.\nAGLAE: FLEES,\nMEL: (CALLS AFTER HER, HURT) Aglae!\nEUMACHIA: Your friend has denied you, girl.

You would do well to\nDOCTOR: sell her to a stricter master, for the girl’s own good. She is still young,\nDOCTOR: 183\nDOCTOR: she will fetch a handsome price at market.\nDOCTOR: Mel is far more precious than money, Valeria. If she gets hurt —\nVALERIA: — then \"twill be her own doing. She has too strong a\nVALERIA: spirit. She is too quick to do what she ought not to do.\nDOCTOR: No. She wants to do what she can't do. That’s the\nDOCTOR: a If it troubles you, Doctor, then you should seek the counsel of Isis.

I cannot\nDOCTOR: interfere.\nVALERIA: Today the priests give but an animal to Isis. But I would\nVALERIA: gladly surrender my life to her should she desire it. Would you do less for your god?\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERS) The trouble is, Valeria, it’s not just my life.\nDOCTOR: 20.

These men, who have toiled long and hard in the fields without our city, would know why the earth shakes so; why the fruit of the seeds that they have so diligently sewn is taken from them. It is our fear that Pompeii has earned the disfavour of the gods. We ask you, sweet goddess, how might we atone for our sins? We render unto you this sacrifice, and hope that you might look with kindness upon our humble plea.\nMEL: Oh, Aglae! This person you said could help me - you were talking about your god, weren’t you?\nAGLAE: Have I done wrong, Mel, in bringing you to the temple of Isis?\nMEL: No offence, Aglae, I just don’t think standing in a\nMEL: courtyard and listening to some priest talking about farmers is going to help.\nAGLAE: But Bumachia told me you serve our goddess.\nMEL: Eumachia was wrong, I’m afraid. THE PRIEST FINISHES HIS SPEECH ABOUT NOW, TO MURMURS OF ANTICIPATION.\nAGLAE: E’en so, Mel, you should take your troubles to her. She may yet choose to favour you.\nMEL: I don’t think so.\nFROM: UP NEAR THE PRIEST, WE HEAR A DISTRESSED GOAT. THE\nCROWD: IS QUITE EXCITED NOW, AND MEL AND AGLAE TALK AT\nNORMAL: SPEAKING VOLUME.\nNORMAL: What's happening now?\nAGLAE: See, Mell The priests make an offering to Isis. They bring our sacrifice to her out onto the steps of the temple. to the altars.\nMEL: That's horrible!\nAGLAE: (SURPRISED) The goddess requires an offering. Mel.\nMEL: That's no excuse to slaughter an innocent animal.\nAGLAE: (AFRAID) Oh, please do not speak out!\nMEL: I should, you know. I should go up there and give that\nMEL: man a piece of my mind. (SIGHS, TO SELF) But that wouldn’t change anything, would it? And it might be just the action that keeps me here forever.\nAGLAE: Mel?\nMEL: I'm sorry Aglae, I can't watch this.\nMEL: 185\nMEL: WE FOLLOW THEM OUT ONTO A QUIET STREET (ALTHOUGH WE CAN\nSTILL: HEAR THE CROWD IN THE COURTYARD), WHERE THEY BUMP INTO CELSINUS.\nCELSINUS: You leave so soon, my lady?\nMEL: You again!\nCELSINUS: Popidius Celsinus, devoted servant to Isis. I have heard much of your visit to our city. I watched you earlier, as you perused our shops.\nMEL: Yes, so I noticed.\nCELSINUS: (MILDLY OFFENDED) I serve on the municipal council, may lady. It is natural that a fair young stranger in our city should interest me.\nAGLAE: May I present Mel, my lord.\nMEL: (ARCHLY) It's Melanie, actually.\nCELSINUS: Perhaps, fair Melanie, I might show you the inside of our temple, for which I paid myself?\nMEL: I'd rather not, if you don’t mind.\nCELSINUS: Then at least do me the honour of dining with me. Your travelling companion is also welcome. We have much to discuss, I fancy.\nMEL: I don’t know about that.\nAGLAE: Mel! You cannot decline such an honour.\nMEL: An honour? (BEAT) Of course! You’re a councillor, right?\nCELSINUS: I am one of Pompeii’s decuriones.\nMEL: So, if I wanted some work doing — say, some rubble\nMEL: shifting - then you could speed things up for me?\nCELSINUS: It would please me to render what assistance I may. Will you then accept my invitation?\nMEL: What do you think, Aglae? Are you hungry? (BEAT) Oh, I see. Not good enough to eat with the upper classes, is she? Well, in that case —\nAGLAE: It matters not, Mel, really. I must return to my work at the Lupanar. Asellina will wonder what\nAGLAE: has become of me.\nAGLAE: LEAVES.\nCELSINUS: So, Melanie?\nMEL: (TAKES A DEEP BREATH TO STEEL HERSELF) All right\nMEL: then, Celsinus, you win. I'll have dinner with you.\nCELSINUS: ‘You are most gracious, lady.\nMEL: And do you know why? Because, under normal circumstances, it’s the last thing in the world I’d dream of doing. And that’s a good thing right now... (UNCERTAINLY) I think.\nMEL: CELSINUS. And your companion?\nMEL: T left him at Valeria Hedone’s inn.\nCELSINUS: Come then, Mel. We shall fetch him as we walk.\nCELSINUS: 22. THE HOUSE OF EUMACHTA\nCELSINUS: A SLAVE SHOWS THE DOCTOR, MEL AND CELSINUS INTO A SMALL ROOM WITH A TILED FLOOR, WHERE EUMACHIA GREETS THEM.\nOTHER: SLAVES ARE BUSTLING IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM, SETTING A\nTABLE: FOR DINNER.\nTABLE: 186\nCHLSINUS: My friends, may I introduce the mistress of the house.\nEUMACHIA: , Eumachia, at your service.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Delighted to meet you.\nEUMACHIA: And I, you.\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor and this is my friend, Melanie.\nMEL: We've met, actually. (TO CELSINUS) I thought you said\nMEL: we were eating at your house?\nCELSINUS: (SURPRISED) It was not my intention to mislead you. I thought you would be honoured to dine with a priestess.\nMEL: Are you telling me the truth, Celsinus? This wouldn’t be some kind of a trap, would it?\nEUMACHIA: (LAUGHING) Fear not, girl. Eumachia holds no grudge for ill words chosen in haste. Doubtless you knew not to whom you were speaking.\nMEL: I was rather more concerned with what you were doing.\nDOCTOR: CHURRIEDLY) That's, ah, very gracious of you, EBumachia. (ASIDE) You can tell me about it later, Mel.\nBUMACHIA: The sky is overcast; I fear the evening will not bring clement weather. We shall eat, then, here in the triclinium.\nDOCTOR: An excellent idea. Come along Mel, let's take our places, shall we? THEY MOVE INTO THE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE, TO MEL) We lie down on the couches.\nMEL: (ASIDE) I can't eat lying down.\nDOCTOR: When in Rome, Mel... or at least in the Roman Empire. And we eat with our hands. THE FOUR DINERS LOWER THEMSELVES ONTO COUCHES AROUND THE\nLOW: GENTRAL TABLE, WHICH THE SLAVES ARE STILL SETTING.\nSUMACHIA: It pleases me to entertain you, Doctor, Melanie. There is much I would know of these strangers about whom the whole of Pompeii speaks.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHING) I hope we aren’t a disappointment. You know how rumours can get out of hand.\nEUMACHIA: Indeed. So, is it true you are a holy man, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (GUARDEDLY) I have the utmost respect for your beliefs.\nEUMACHIA: And for the cult of the foreign goddess?\nCELSINUS: Foreign Isis may be, Rumachia, but she ts as wondrous and kind as any member of the Triad.\nDOCTOR: We are simply travellers.\nEUMACHIA: Come now, Doctor. You are plainly more than that.\nDOCTOR: You, ah, have a beautiful house here, Humachia. I\nDOCTOR: particularly admire some of your paintings. MEL. Even if they don’t leave much to the imagination.\nEUMACHIA: Thank you, Doctor. I come from a family of good\nCELSINUS: The Humachii own Pompeii’s wool market.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nEUMACHIA: And what of you, Doctor? Are you a wealthy man?\nDOCTOR: In some respects. I always find money to be a little overrated.\nDOCTOR: BY NOW, THE SLAVES HAVE FINISHED THEIR WORK AND LEFT.\nDOCTOR: 187\nCELSINUS: (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) You keep a splendid table, Eumachia.\nDOCTOR: Yes, very appetising. (ASIDE) You might wish to avoid the roasted thrush, Mel. ;\nMEL: (BEMUSED) Thanks for the warning.\nEUMACHIA: Well, eat heartily my friends! By the grace of the Venus Pompeiana, our stomachs will be full tonight.\nCELSINUS: And let us each drink to the health of our host, and to that of the Emperor Titus.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nDOCTOR: THEY DRINK, AND THEN BEGIN TO EAT (WITH THEIR HANDS, AS NOTED). CELSINUS EATS LOUDLY AND APPRECIATIVELY.\nCELSINUS: These lark’s tongues are delicious, Eumachia!\nMEL: (ASIDE, WITH HER MOUTH FULL, DISGUSTED) Oh, Doctor!\nEUMACHIA: Is the food not to your liking?\nMEL: It’s... you see I'm a vegetarian and -\nEBUMACHIA: Veget... (THINKS) No. No, I am not familiar with the name. Is this Vegetaria a province far from here?\nMEL: No, it's -\nDOCTOR: It's a long way from here indeed.\nCELSINUS: Melanie, you said you are in need of assistance?\nEUMACHIA: Oh?\nCELSINUS: A small matter of a... lost treasure, was it not?\nDOCTOR: (WITH A FALSE, WORRIED LAUGH) It really isn’t important.\nMEL: Yes it is, Doctor. Celsinus might be able to help us.\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) I don’t think so, Mel.\nMEL: (SAM#) It's worth a try, isn’t it? Why have you given up?\nEUMACHIA: Perhaps you should tell us what vexes you. It may be that we can offer aid.\nDOCTOR: (TO EUMACHIA AND CELSINUS) I mislaid a little something of mine. But it needn’t concern you.\nEUMACHIA: Might this be the temple of which people speak?\nEUMACHIA: A LONG PAUSE; EVEN CELSINUS STOPS EATING.\nEUMACHIA: I see I have disconcerted you, Doctor. Such was not my intent.\nEUMACHIA: a It sounded to me like you knew exactly what you were saying.\nEUMACHIA: You should know that the citizens of Pompeii believe you both to have come from Isis; to be her messengers.\nDOCTOR: As I said, rumours can get out of hand.\nMEL: (QUIETLY) Yes. I thought we came from Vegetaria now.\nEUMACHIA: And the servants of a goddess may wish to keep their secrets.\nDOCTOR: We have not come from Isis, I assure you.\nDOCTOR: CELSINUS. (SCANDALISED) But Melanie herself said it was so!\nEUMACHIA: Then there is some confusion, is there not?\nDOCTOR: ‘You must have misunderstood.\nEUMACHIA: Or perhaps you fear we could see through your\nEUMACHIA: 188\nEUMACHIA: deceptions, as a simple slave and a beggar woman could not.\nDOCTOR: Really, I —\nEUMACHIA: (FORCEFULLY) You are a liar, Doctor - and, if you are not, then this girl surely is.\nMEL: (INSULTED) I'm as honest as they come!\nDOCTOR: (WARNINGLY) Mel!\nMEL: (ASIDE) Why don’t we just tell them, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SAME) We can’t do that.\nMEL: But it wouldn’t change anything, would it? No one can\nMEL: stop the... what’s going to happen. And they might be able to do something for us\nDOCTOR: It wouldn't do any good, Mel. HE STANDS, ABRUPTLY.\nDOCTOR: (TO THE OTHERS) You should disregard what my companion says. Too much wine, I expect.\nMEL: (INSULTED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Thank you for your kind hospitality, but we really ought to leave.\nCELSINUS: Please stay, Doctor. Tell us more of —\nEUMACHIA: (SCORNFULLY) No, Celsinus. Can you not see it? They flee from the light of truth!\nDOCTOR: ‘You were right, Mel. These people never had any intention of helping us.\nDOCTOR: HE HURRIES MEL OUT OF THE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: 23. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN THERE ARE FEW CUSTOMERS LEFT NOW, AND THE STREET OUTSIDE IS QUIET. VALERIA IS AT THE BAR WHEN MURRANUS ENTERS.\nVALERIA: Murranus! I did not expect your return.\nMURRANUS: I am in need of wine, Valeria.\nVALERIA: Then fortune is not with you. I shall serve no more\nVALERIA: today. I have but to remove these last few drunkards, and I shall take my rest.\nMURRANUS: (BANGS HIS FIST ON THE BAR, ANGHILY) Wine, woman! The finest gladiator in Pompeii will not be denied! By Jupiter, has my reputation fallen so far in so short a time?\nMURRANUS: VALERIA. (SIGHS) Very well, Murranus. I shall pour you one cup, and no more.\nMUREANUS: Well must you know you what drives me to drink,\nMUREANUS: Valeria. Why, even your wall tells of my disgrace — and who is responsible for that, I wonder?\nVALERIA: FILLS A CUP.\nVALERIA: My inn has been full through the festival, Murranus. I cannot see all that occurs within.\nMURRANUS: I would see how the culprit fares against my sword, if his only weapon be the words of a coward.\nVALERIA: PLACES THE CUP IN FRONT OF HIM.\nVALERIA: I will not countenance another fight here.\nMURRANUS: (TAKES A LARGE GULP OF WINE) But my first concern must be the restoration of my honour. The stranger! The cheat! The... the...\nMURRANUS: 189\nVALERIA: Doctor.\nMUREANUS: The Doctor, aye! He is responsible for my shame.\nVALERIA: You know it is said that the Doctor and his friend are from Isis?\nMURBANUS: The prattling of the masses! Besides, it matters not to me. This Doctor impugned my honesty —\nVALERIA: He but told the truth.\nMUBRANUS: - and used trickery and fortune to outfight me.\nVALEERIA: You attacked him.\nMURRANUS: (SAGGING) You know of my past. Valeria. You know the crime for which I was sent to the Amphitheatre. The aediles thought they had sentenced me to die. They knew not that I should prove so mighty a warrior. I live for the contest now, for the glorious battle. But still 1 live for so long as I have the respect of the people, and no longer.\nVALERIA: And for so long as you are victorious.\nMUBRRANUS: Even Murranus cannot always be victorious. And, when a fight is lost, he must depend, like all gladiators, on the mood of the crowd. (BECOMING ANGRY AGAIN) Should I lose their favour, should they think me so easily brought down by a... a deceitful stranger, an impertinent imp... then they shall not vote to spare me again.\nVALERIA: I do see why you are troubled, Murranus.\nMURRANUS: It is a matter of life and death to me, Valeria - and I swear, it will be the Doctor’s death that safeguards my life.\nMURRANUS: 24. A POMPEIAN STREET\nEVENING: IS DRAWING IN (SO, NO SEAGULLS). THE DOCTOR AND MEL\nSIT: BESIDE A FOUNTAIN.\nMEL: (DISCONSOLATORY) Well, that was a complete waste of time!\nDOCTOR: (SYMPATHETICALLY) It wouldn’t have worked, Mel.\nDOCTOR: There's nothing you could have done.\nMEL: I thought I could get somewhere with Celsinus; that he’d\nMEL: help us get the TARDIS back. I just made things a hundred times worse, didn’t I?\nDOCTOR: You mustn't give up.\nDOCTOR: MEL. Why not? You already have!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I did. But not any more.\nMEL: You said —\nDOCTOR: I know what I said, Mel. But you were right. There may\nDOCTOR: still be a chance. And, so long as there is, I can’t abandon the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: (RELIEVED) I knew you’d come round in the end. So, what do we do first?\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) I didn’t say there was a good chance. (HE TAKES A LONG PAUSE) I want you to leave here.\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR: I can’t risk your life as well as my own. I want you to leave Pompeii before it’s too late.\nMEL: No!\nDOCTOR: Don’t make this difficult, Mel.\nMEL: I'm not leaving you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s too dangerous for you here. You said it yourself:\nDOCTOR: 190\nDOCTOR: Bumachia bears a grudge against you.\nMEL: And you too, now. You'll need me here. A HORSE AND CART APPROACHES.\nDOCTOR: What I need, Mel, is for you to be safe. I got you into this. I can’t be responsible for... for...\nMEL: (SUSPICIOUSLY) You think this is it, don’t you? You.\nMEL: don't expect to get the TARDIS back at all. You think you're going to die here! And you want me to be somewhere nice and safe, far away. when it happens. THE DOCTOR DOESN'T ANSWER. SECONDS LATER, THE HORSE AND\nCART: ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM. FUMACHIA IS IN THE CART. ll acaa Stop the cart. Stop! That is the girl, there.\nCART: What's going on now? THE HORSE STOPS. EUMACHIA GETS OUT OF THE CART, ALONG WITH\nTWO: MEN.\nEUMACHIA: You cannot run from justice, vile thief! I would know where you have taken my precious jewels, that my poor dead husband gave to me. And if you will not tell me, then you will tell these men.\nMEL: I don't know anything about your jewels.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure there's been some mistake.\nBUMACHIA: Liar! I invited you into my house in good faith, and you have stolen from me. My slaves bear witness to it. Take her away, Centurion! THE MEN MARCH FORWARD AND SEIZE MEL.\nMEL: Get off me! Both of you, get your hands off me!\nEUMACHIA: The aediles will have the truth from you if I cannot.\nMEL: Can't you see she’s lying? She’s trying to frame me. Doctor!\nEUMACHIA: They will not take his word against that of a priestess.\nDOCTOR: Another attempt to discredit Isis, Eumachia?\nMEL: STRUGGLES, BUT IS MANHANDLED INTO THE CART.\nEUMACHIA: Your friend will serve my purpose well, Doctor.\nMEL: (SHOUTS) Doctor, do something!\nEUMACHIA: There is nought he can do, child. It will go better for you if you but speak the truth.\nEUMACHIA: MEL. (SHOUTS, ANGRILY) The truth? Oh, you don’t want to know the truth, I promise you.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTS, URGENTLY) This won't do any good, Mell! THE CART PULLS AWAY; MEL’S VOICE RECEDES.\nMEL: (PANICKING) You can’t lock me up. You can’t! Don’t you\nMEL: realise? You'll kill me! This time tomorrow, we’re all going to be dead! Do you hear me? We've got to get out of Pompeii before it’s too late.

I am tired.\nDOCTOR: Tired of all the responsibility. In fact, you’re tired of\nDOCTOR: everything, aren’t you, Celsinus? Tired of being a good councillor to the people. Tired of being a good servant to Isis. Tired of having to solve everybody else’s problems. It’s late, Popidius Celsinus, and you want to rest, don’t you?\nCELSINUS: I would like to rest.

Just you.\nMEL: No, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: There's no time to argue. I want you to hide in the\nDOCTOR: wagon until you're safely out of the city. Then you and Aglae should get as far away from here as possible.\nMEL: And what about you?\nDOCTOR: I told you before, if there's a chance of finding the\nTARDIS: —\nTARDIS: 195\nMEL: Then I’m not leaving either. s\nDOCTOR: CIMPATIENTLY) The best way to change history, Mel, is to do something unexpected; something totally out of character; something you would never have done if it wasn’t for your knowledge of the future.\nMEL: Like what?\nDOCTOR: Like doing as I tell you for once!\nMEL: But you said if we make a deliberate attempt to change history —\nDOCTOR: (EXASPEHATED) Just do it, Mel. Please!\nMEL: Well... OK, Doctor... if you’re sure it’s the right thing to do. (CLIMBS INTO THE WAGOM) But I'm still not happy about this.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t goodbye, Mel.\nMEL: It feels like it. You’ll never dig out the TARDIS in time.\nDOCTOR: I don’t have to.\nMEL: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: It isn’t buried. Somebody moved it before the building collapsed.\nMEL: How can you possibly know that?\nDOCTOR: T should have seen it much earlier, Mel. That part of the\nDOCTOR: city was excavated long before 1980. If the TARDIS really was beneath that rubble, it would have been discovered then.\nMEL: So, who do you think moved it?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, but I intend to find out. And Pll find you,\nDOCTOR: Mel, I promise - with or without the TARDIS. I don’t intend to die here.\nMEL: (STERNLY> You better hadn't, Doctor.\nMEL: A LONG PAUSE, THEN THE DOCTOR WALKS TO AGLAE.\nDOCTOR: She’s ready to go now, Aglae.\nAGLAE: Goodbye, Doctor.

I must return with the supplies before dawn.\nLEGIONARY: Then ‘you may pass, girl... once I have checked your wagon.\nAGLAE: (AFRAID) My wagon?\nAGLAE: 196\nLEGIONARY: It will be empty for the outward journey, will it not?\nAGLAE: It is a most urgent errand. Please, open the gate.\nLEGIONARY: Dismount, girl.\nAGLAE: (COWED) As you wish, sir.\nAGLAE: DISMOUNTS AND FOLLOWS THE LEGIONARY ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE WAGON.\nLEGIONARY: Now, what’s in the back here —\nLEGIONARY: HE PULLS BACK THE CLOTH.\nMEL: (WEAKLY) I expect you're surprised to find me here.\nAGLAE: HITS THE LEGIONARY ON HIS NECK/SHOULDERS WITH A\nSTICK: (IT MIGHT CLANG AGAINST HIS HELMET TOO), KNOCKING HIM OVER.\nLEGIONARY: (GRUNT OF PAIN)\nMEL: (SHRIEKS) Agiae!\nAGLAE: (HORRIFIED) Oh Mel, what have I done?\nMEL: (ASTONISHED) You've knocked him out, that’s what. What did you hit him with?\nAGLAE: This... It is an arm, from that statue... the earthquakes must have shaken it loose.\nMEL: I know I told you to be a bit more assertive, Aglae, but I didn't mean —\nAGLAE: (TEARFULLY) When the aediles hear of this, I will go the lions for my sins.\nMEL: (DETERMINED) No! No you won't, Agiae. Not if they don’t catch you. Get back on that horse, go on. Let’s get out of here!\nAGLAE: But, Mel, the gate is still closed.\nLEGIONARY: (GHOANS AS HE BEGINS TO STIR)\nMEL: Well, there’s no time to open it - and I don’t like the\nMEL: look of that legionary’s sword.\nSHE: JUMPS OUT OF THE WAGON. That wagon wasn't very comfortable anyway. It looks like we’re on foot from now on. Come on, Aglae. THEY RUN TOWARDS THE GATE.\nSHE: 30. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN\nSHE: THE RAIN HAS STOPPED. WOODEN SHUTTERS ARE DOWN OVER THE FRONT OF THE INN. SOMEBODY KNOCKS ON THEM FROM WITHOUT,\nWAKING: MURRANUS.\nMURRANUS: (GROANS) What in Jupiter’s name —? THE KNOCKING COMES AGAIN, MORE URGENTLY.\nDOCTOR: (FROM OUTSIDE) Valeria!\nVALERIA: ENTERS DOWN A FLIGHT OF WOODEN STAIRS.\nVALERIA: What is that infernal racket? Murranus! Are you still here?\nMURRANUS: (BLEARILY) My lady... I must have fallen asleep at your\nVALERIA: You did indeed, mirmillo — and it is time you stirred yourself and returned to your barracks. It is almost dawn.\nVALERIA: THE DOCTOR KNOCKS AGAIN.\nDOCTOR: Valeria!\nVALERIA: (CALLS, IRRITATED) Be gone with you! Can you not see\nVALERIA: 197\nVALERIA: the shutters are up? Festival or no, I am entitled to some sleep.\nDOCTOR: Valeria, J must speak to you.\nVALERIA: Doctor?\nMURBRANUS: (SUDDENLY ALERT) Doctor?\nMURBRANUS: A TENSE PAUSE.\nVALERIA: Hold, Doctor, I have to... adjust my clothing.\nMUBRANUS: (ASIDE, SO THE DOCTOR CAN’T HEAR) The Doctor ~— here! Oh, but the fates are kind to me this morning. The source of my shame has walked into my grasp.\nVALERLA: (SAME) I will have no fighting in my bar, Murranus, I warned you of that last night.\nMURRANUS: He must pay for his treachery!\nVALERIA: (SHARPLY) Murranus!\nMURRANUS: (IGNORING HER) Damn you, Valeria. Damn you for plying me with your wine.\nVALERIA: I heard no complaints at the time.\nMURRANUS: I am not yet ready for this. My head aches. My stomach feels as if Vulcan himself has stoked his fire within.\nVALERIA: Then I shall send him away. It is a simple matter.\nMURRANUS: No! No, let him enter. 1 shall take cover in your back room until I have had time to think. And you, Valeria... (HAS AN IDEA) Yes, yes, with your assistance, I shall see my honour restored.\nVALERIA: I want no part of this, Murranus.\nMURRANUS: (ANGRILY) Your wants do not concern me, woman. My life is at stake. If you obstruct my mission, then know that you will be my sworn enemy — and you will suffer the same fate as the Doctor.\nMURRANUS: 31. INSIDE A TOMB\nMURRANUS: MEL AND AGLAE HAVE TAKEN SHELTER HERE. MEL OPENS THE\nHEAVY: DOOR A CRACK TO PEER OUTSIDE. IT IS MORNING, AND WE HEAR THE CRIES OF SEAGULLS AGAIN.\nAGLAE: CIN A FEARFUL WHISPER) Do you see ought, Mel?\nMEL: Only that the sun's coming up. It looks like being a beautiful morning. A lot warmer than it is in this old crypt, anyway.\nAGLAE: But what of the legionary?\nMEL: No sign of him, thank goodness.\nSHE: CLOSES THE DOOR.\nSHE: AGLAE. I was certain he had followed us into the necropolis. I\nSHE: even feared he had spied us as we entered this tomb.\nMEL: Well, he isn’t out there now, and this place is giving me the creeps.\nAGLAE: Oh Mel, you ought not to be afraid of the spirits of our ancestors. So long as we are respectful to them, they can only assist us.\nMEL: All the same, I'd rather not spend any more time than I have to with their bones. I think we should be making a move now.\nAGLAE: (DISTRESSED) No, Mel, I cannot. We will surely be seen. We have passed beyond the city walls. Is that not enough?\nMEL: No, Aglae, it isn’t. You heard what the Doctor said. We\nMEL: pave.to to get as far away as possible. And now that we don’t even have a orse..\nMEL: 198\nAGLAE: (TEARFULLY) Oh, Mel, I have brought this misfortune upon us.\nMEL: No you haven't, Aglae. You’ve done the right thing, I promise.\nAGLAE: When the Doctor came to me last night, he made it\nAGLAE: sound so right, so necessary, that I should flee Pompeii. Now, in the light of dawn, I look on what I have done and I see how foolish it was. I have earned the gods’ wrath.\nMEL: Not necessarily. We've got a chance, if you'll take it.\nAGLAE: Asellina will be rising now. She will see I am not about. my chores. Soon, everyone will know my shame.\nMEL: Believe me, Aglae, it won't matter soon. Now are you coming or not?\nAGLAE: i\nMEL: OPENS THE DOOR AGAIN.\nMEL: No one’s going to catch us, Aglae, and the gods certainly\nMEL: aren't about to punish us. We're just doing what we can to save our —\nMEL: THE LEGIONARY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.\nAGLAE: (SHRIEKS) Mel, no!\nLEGIONARY: So, this is where you thought to hide from me?\nMEL: (RUEFULLY) I may have spoken too soon.\nMEL: 32. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN THE DOCTOR AND VALERIA SIT AT THE BAR.\nVALERIA: Are you certain you will not take a drink, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTEDLY) Hmm? Oh, no, no thank you, Valeria. There’s no time. I need to keep a clear head... to think. To look for\nVALERIA: I shall pour you one anyway. You may change your mind.\nSHE: FILLS A CUP WITH WINE.\nDOCTOR: So, reminind me: Pompeii is under the rule of two duoviri, right?\nVALERIA: They answer to the Emperor, of course.\nDOCTOR: Of course. And beneath them...?\nVALERIA: The aediles, Doctor, and one hundred decuriones beneath them.\nDOCTOR: Like Celsinus. And the elected magistrates beneath\nDOCTOR: them. A lot of the graffiti in the city refers to electoral candidates. There must be some in-fighting? People trying to climb the political ladder?\nVALERIA: The writings are old. The elections were more than a month since.\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nVALERIA: Must we speak of this now, Doctor? It is past dawn, and\nVALERIA: an uncommonly hot morning it looks like becoming. I will have customers here soon. I have much to prepare.\nDOCTOR: (DEEP IN THOUGHT) Dawn... dawn, yes... there was a ceremony in progress at the Temple of Isis. Greeting the new day. (TO SELF, SADLY) The last day. (TO VALERIA) What do you think of Isis,\nDOCTOR: 199\nDOCTOR: Valeria?\nVALERIA: She is a most benevolent goddess.\nDOCTOR: And what about your rulers? .\nVALERIA: I see what you imply, Doctor, but you are wrong. Foreign\nVALERIA: Isis may be, but she is tolerated and even embraced. Her cult has spread so that even the decuriones now worship at her altar.\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY AGAIN) Yes, Rome always did incorporate the cultures of the people it conquered into its own. (TO VALERIA) But there must be some dissenters? Eumachia, for example.\nVALERIA: Eumachia is a bitter old widow, who fears only that her own power will diminish. You are aware that she is a priestess of the Capitoline Triad?\nDOCTOR: Which is Jupiter, Juno and Minerva?\nDOCTOR: ‘VALERIA: Although she worships many gods, as we all do.\nDOCTOR: (REMEMBERING) Venus Pompeiana...\nVALERIA: Aye, the official goddess of Pompeii. She brings us\nVALERIA: fortune and prosperity. And the Emperor, of course, the only god who may walk on this Earth. Are you sure you will not drink, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) I shouldn’t be doing this, Valeria.\nVALERIA: I do not understand.\nDOCTOR: I shouldn’t be here. Talking to you. Trying to find my\nDOCTOR: ship. If it weren't for my foreknowledge, I’d still be in that back street, trying to shift debris, letting time run through my fingers.\nVALERIA: You make no sense to me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Best not to think about it. But how can I ignore it?\nVALERIA: You need sleep\nVALERIA: THE DOCTOR STANDS.\nDOCTOR: No time to sleep. I must find the TARDIS.\nVALERIA: Then at least take this drink.\nSHE: PUSHES THE FULL CUP ACROSS THE BAR TOWARDS HIM.\nSHE: I cannot help you with your arduous task, Doctor, but I can ensure that you are refreshed for it.\nDOCTOR: (UNCERTAIN FOR A MOMENT, THEN) Yes. Yes, I think I will. Thank you, Valeria. (HE DRINKS)\nDOCTOR: 33. A PRISON CELL\nDOCTOR: MEL AND AGLAEF ARE IMPRISONED HERE. MEL BANGS FRANTICALLY ON THE DOOR.\nMEL: (SHOUTS) Hello? Can you hear me?... I know there’s somebody out there. I want to see my friend.. Hello?\nAGLAE: It is no use, Mel. The guard will not come.\nMEL: I can’t believe I’m right back where I started. Back in Pompeii. Back in this cell.\nAGLAE: (SELF-PITYING) We have transgressed against the gods.\nMEL: (GROANS) Please, Aglae, not again. What time do you think it is?\nAGLAE: I know not, Mel, but the morning grows long.\nMEL: ‘Yes, that’s ‘what I was afraid of. And it’s getting a bit too warm for my liking too.\nAGLAE: I have stolen from my mistress and run from her. I\nAGLAE: have attacked a soldier of the Empire. I deserve to be punished.\nAGLAE: 200\nMEL: Well, you might be punished a bit more harshly than you expected if we don't get out of here soon. (BANGS ON THE DOOR; SHOUTS) I know you can hear me out there. I demand to see somebody in charge. Hello? (GIVES UP WITH A SIGH) The worst thing is, the Doctor doesn’t even know we're back here. We can't count on a rescue from him this time. We’ve got to do something for ourselves.\nAGLAE: He will learn of our plight soon enough. The whole of Pompeii will hear of our actions. There will be much talk.\nMEL: (GLOOMILY) I don’t know if that’s comforting or worrying.\nAGLAE: But the Doctor, I fear, can do nought to help those who have offended the gods.\nMEL: (SIGHS) OK then, Aglae, you’ve convinced me. There's only one thing for it - more's the pity.\nAGLAE: Mel?\nMEL: (BANGS ON THE DOOR; SHOUTS) Listen to me! I want\nMEL: you to take a message to someone — and I’m sure he’ll be very cross with you if you don’t. (TAKES A DEEP BREATH) Tell Popidius Celsinus I want to see him, please.\nMEL: 34. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN THE DOCTOR'S DRINK WAS DRUGGED. MUCH AS HE TRIES TO RESIST IT, HE IS FALLING ASLEEP.\nDOCTOR: (DROWSILY) Valeria, what have I been drinking?\nVALERIA: Only the finest local wine, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING TO TALK) Tired... so tired...\nVALERIA: It is to be expected. You have been up all night.\nDOCTOR: Drugged... the wine.. Valeria...\nVALERIA: I'm sorry, Doctor.\nMURRANUS: ENTERS.\nMUBEANUS: (TAUNTINGLY) Why, Doctor, you ought to show our host some gratitude. She flavoured your drink with a concoction of herbs that will aid your relaxation... at my suggestion, of course.\nDOCTOR: (ONE LAST GASP BEFORE HE SUCCUMBS) Murranus!\nMURRANUS: You have done well, Valeria.\nVALERIA: (SCORNFULLY) I have done your dirty work for you,\nVALERIA: Murranus, and may the gods curse me for it.\nMURRANUS: (MOCKINGLY) You are most kind.\nVALERIA: Oh, Murranus, when will you see? This Doctor isn’t your enemy. You don’t need to kill him to make your point.\nMURRANUS: it is my life at stake, Valeria. I shall be the judge of what I must do.\nVALERIA: If that is the case, then you will take yourself away from this inn, Murranus. You are no longer welcome here.\nMURRANUS: I go gladly, Valeria — so long as I take my prize\nMURRANUS: with me.\nMURRANUS: 3S. A POMPEIAN STREET\nMURRANUS: I? IS LATE MORNING, AND THE STREET IS FAIRLY BUSY. MEL AND\nCELSINUS: WALK TOGETHER, TRAILED BY SEVERAL SLAVES.\nCELSINUS: 201\nMEL: Oh really, Celsinus, are all these slaves necessary? I’m\nMEL: hardly going to overpower you and run away, now am I?\nCELSINUS: ‘You have escaped before, Melanie. I cannot take the risk\nCELSINUS: that it will happen again. It was difficult enough to persuade the aediles to release you into my care, so we could talk like this.\nMEL: (AGGRIEVED) Yes, and it took you long enough too —\nMEL: and poor old Aglae’s still locked up in that awful cell.\nCELSINUS: T have done all I can, Melanie — and you must return to\nCELSINUS: that gaol yourself.\nMEL: Oh Gelsinus, I’m grateful for your freeing me, of course.\nMEL: But I wish you’d believe what I’ve told you. We’re running out of time.\nCELSINUS: I know not, Melanie. Your story is incredible, and your\nCELSINUS: prophecy goes against what Isis herself has promised.\nMEL: What’s Isis got to do with it?\nCELSINUS: You saw how the farmers went to her temple yesterday.\nCELSINUS: She gave them her blessing. She decrees that better days will come;\nCELSINUS: that the mountainside will again be fertile.\nMEL: It’s lies, Celsinus. Superstitious lies! Why can’t you see\nMEL: that? (HE IS AGHAST; SHE TRIES TO MOLLIFY HIM) I'm sorry, but I’m\nMEL: telling you the truth, I swear. I don’t know how much trouble I'll get\nMEL: into for it, but I am telling you the truth.\nCELSINUS: I want to believe you, Melanie, but you have lied before.\nMEL: I told you, I didn’t think I had a choice. You’ve got to\nMEL: believe me, Celsinus, it just isn’t like me to tell lies. (RUEFULLY) And\nMEL: after all the damage it’s caused this time, I'll be even less likely to do it\nMEL: in future.\nCELSINUS: I could speak to the aediles this afterncon—\nMEL: (FRUSTRATED) By this afternoon, we'll be dead!\nCELSINUS: (ANGUISHED) How can I believe that the gods would so\nCELSINUS: abandon Pompeii? You speak of the mountain erupting, girl, but\nCELSINUS: Vesuvius is no volcano. Why, our people have farmed its slopes for\nCELSINUS: generations.\nMEL: Then they’re about to get a big surprise, I’m afraid.\nCELSINUS: But why would Vulcan send his fire to destroy us now?\nCELSINUS: He was so pleased with our offerings yesterday.\nMEL: I don’t know how to prove it to you, Celsinus, and by\nMEL: the time I can it will be too late for any of us. You’ve just got to trust\nMEL: me.\nSELENE: And the oracles of Isis; why did they not foresee this oom\nMEL: (DESPERATELY) Can't you give me the benefit of the\nMEL: doubt? Just for a couple of hours? After that, if it turns out I was lying\nMEL: to you, you can lock me up and throw away the key! Just a couple of\nMEL: hours, Celsinus.\nCELSINUS: (STILL SUSPICIOUS) What do you want from me?\nCELSINUS: beer Somebody took something from us — from the Doctor and me.\nCELSINUS: This is the temple of which Eumachia spoke?\nMEL: I suppose so, yes. But it’s not a temple.\nCELSINUS: A blue box carved from wood, Eumachia said, Painted with signs that made no sense.. . (FALTERINGLY) “Po... Po- lick-ay.\nMEL: (SPELLING IT TO HERSELF) Pol.. P-O-L... yes! Police\nMEL: 202\nMEL: Box’! Eumachia told you that?\nCELSINUS: Is that not correct?\nMEL: No! I mean, yes. Yes it is. It’s absolutely correct. (THOUGHTFULLY) But how did Eumachia...? Unless... (SUDDENLY ENTHUSIASTIC) That’s it! That’s got to be it! Oh Celsinus, I could kiss you.\nCELSINUS: My lady?\nMEL: Don’t you see? Eumachia couldn’t have described the TARDIS in such detail unless she'd seen it herself. She took it, she must have done!\nCELSINUS: But, Melanie, the strange manner of your arrival here has been the talk of the city.\nMEL: (THINKING HARD) Maybe. But... but how many people actually saw it? And how many can read — or even recognise letters? Not many of the slaves, I'll bet... No, it makes sense. Eumachia must have seen the TARDIS. And she wants to discredit Isis. So, if she thought the Doctor and I were her messengers come to Pompeii in some... some magical temple...\nMEL: Ss: (TRYING TO KEEP UP) You blame Eumachia for your joss?\nMEL: Yes, Celsinus, I do. (TO SELF, EXULTANTLY) I do. I’ve actually done it! I’ve found out where the TARDIS is. We can't be destined to lose it here. (TO CELSINUS) I want to go back to Eumachia’s house.\nCELSINUS: Is that wise?\nMEL: She's got the TARDIS, Celsinus, I know she has. And that’s the one thing that can save my life... all our lives... right now.\nMEL: 36, THE AMPHITHEATRE\nMEL: THE AMPHITHEATRE IS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, BUT MURRANUS HAS CARRIED THE SLEEPING DOCTOR TO THE CENTRE OF THE ARENA. HE POKES THE DOCTOR WITH HIS TOE, STIRRING HIM.\nMURRANUS: Wake, Doctor! Come on, wake! I am eager for our final confrontation.\nDOCTOR: (BLEARILY) Mmm? What...? Where am I? The Amphitheatre? How did...? Murranus! Murranus, you tricked me. MURBRANUS. As you also tricked me yesterday, Doctor. You fought without honour. Now you will pay for that.\nDOCTOR: You talk of fighting with honour? You had Valeria drug me, (SUDDENLY WORRIED) Wait! Wait, how long have I been unconscious?\nMURBRANUS: Several hours, Doctor, but worry not: when next you sleep, it will be for much longer. (LAUGHS CRUELLY)\nDOCTOR: (PICKS HIMSELF UP; ANGRILY) You idiot, Murranus. Do you have any idea what you've done?\nMURRANUS: (WITH EQUAL ANGER) I have done what is necessary to regain what you stole from me. You cannot take the coward’s way out this time, Doctor. My comrades in arms guard the exits from this arena. THE MEN GROWL ACCORDINGLY\nMURRANUS: Now choose your weapons, and we shall settle our\nMURRANUS: 203\nMURRANUS: differences like men.\nDOCTOR: You're forgetting something, Murranus. The Amphitheatre is closed. You have no audience here.\nMURRANUS: It matters not. Word will spread that I have bested you. They will talk of my great victory for months.\nDOCTOR: And that will please you, will it? Killing me will make you happy?\nMURRANUS: Here, Doctor! You have the build of a retarius. You can\nMURRANUS: fight with the net and trident of one.\nMURRANUS: THROWS THE IMPLEMENTS TO THE DOCTOR\nDOCTOR: Tm not going to fight you, Murranus. Kill me if you must, but it will have to be in cold blood as I stand here before you, defenceless.\nMURRANUS: (UNDAUNTED) Then so it shall be.\nANOTHER: QUAKE BEGINS, QUIETLY AT FIRST BUT BUILDING.\nANOTHER: 3'7. A POMPELAN STREET\nANOTHER: THE QUAKE CONTINUES TO BUILD. IT’S A BAD ONE. THIS ISN’T A\nVERY: POPULOUS AREA, BUT THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT REACT AS BEFORE.\nMEL: (FRIGHTENED) Do you see what I mean now, Celsinus? It’s starting. It's starting already!\nGELSINUS: Caim yourself, Melanie, it is but another earthquake. Pompeii has suffered many. The gods must remain displeased.\nMEL: Can't you see? Can’t you see what’s happening here?\nCELSINUS: Just hold on to me. With the assistance of Isis, we can withstand this trial.\nMEL: I don’t think Isis is going to get help you this time.\nMEL: 38. THE AMPHITHEATRE\nMEL: THE QUAKE CONTINUES. THE GLADIATORS WHO GUARD THE EXITS\nMAKE: DISCONCERTED NOISES.\nMURRANUS: Once again, the gods come to your aid — but this time they cannot do enough to spare you from me.\nDOCTOR: (URGENTLY) I don't have time for this, Murranus!\nMURRANUS: You have no more pressing appointment than with Death, Doctor. It matters not how fierce the quake becomes; we shall have our reckoning.\nMURRANUS: S39. A POMPEIAN STREET\nMURRANUS: THE QUAKE SUBSIDES. FROM THIS POINT ON, WE HEAR NO MORE SEAGULLS.\nCELSINUS: There, Mel, do you see? The quake has ended. There is nought to fear from our gods.\nMEL: Then... then why has the water stopped flowing from that fountain?\nCELSINUS: (PUZZLED) Why, ] do not —\nMEL: And look! Look over there ~ that bird fluttering in its cage. Like it knows what's going to happen. (GASPS IN REALISATION)\nMEL: 204\nMEL: And listen! Listen, Celsinus. Can you hear any seagulls?\nCELSINUS: The gulls have left the sky? But surely -\nMEL: That sundial. What does it say? What time is it?\nCELSINUS: It is near the sixth hour.\nMEL: It’s midday, isn’t it? Of course it is. I can tell by the position of the sun. Can’t you feel it, Celsinus? It’s going to happen. It’s going to happen any minute now.\nCELSINUS: (CUNCERTAINLY) I... do feel something... but, if anytlung, it is an unnatural cabn. Surely...\nCELSINUS: CIN A HORRIFIED WHISPER) It’s too late!\nCELSINUS: 40. THE AMPHITHEATRE\nDOCTOR: CURGENTLY) Fighting won't solve anything, Murranus. We’ve all got more important things to worry about.\nMURRANUS: Pick up the net and trident, Doctor, or you will be defenceless.\nDOCTOR: There has to be another way to settle this.\nMURRBANUS: Fight back or not, Doctor, I will slaughter you either way. I have given you a chance to defend yourself; my conscience is clear. But I will have satisfaction. If you will not take the weapons, then you will die all the sooner.\nDOCTOR: (FURIOUSLY) You think you’ll reclaim your honour this way, but your honour will be worth nothing when you’re reduced to ashes!\nMURRANUS: Die, Doctor, with a coward’s plea on your lips!\nEND: PART THREE\nEND: 205"

I have given you a chance to defend yourself; my conscience is clear. But I will have satisfaction. If you will not take the weapons, then you will die all the sooner.\nDOCTOR: (FURIOUSLY) You think you’ll reclaim your honour this way, but your honour will be worth nothing when you're reduced to ashes!\nMURRANUS: Die, Doctor, with a coward’s plea on your lips!\nMURRANUS: 41, A POMPELAN STREET\nMURRANUS: THERE IS AN UNNATURAL SILENCE.

Slay me if you wish, but it is only thus that you will get to the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I'm very grateful, Valeria, but this really isn’t—\nMURRANUS: (DISMISSIVELY) Begone, woman!

Now you will pay the price for your defiance. And you, Valeria... much as it grieves me, you must be punished also.\nVALERIA: Forgive me, Doctor. I have brought these woes upon us.\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) Don’t worry, Valeria.

Well, thank you for the thought, but it really wasn't —\nLEGIONARY: (SLOWLY REALISING) However, your face is familiar to me. You... you are one of the girls who assaulted me at the gate. Can you have escaped gaol once again?\nLEGIONARY: THE SHOWER INCREASES IN INTENSITY, AND HEAVY STONES BOUNCE OFF THE CANOPY ABOVE THEM.\nMEL: Look, I know how this must seem — but it was Popidius Celsinus who let me out of gaol. You can ask him if you like. Only 1 can't stop to discuss it with you now. I’ve got to be somewhere else.\nLEGIONARY: How can you travel, when hot rocks and ash fall from the sky?\nLEGIONARY: MEL. But you don’t understand. I'm almost there. (HER\nINSISTENCE: DRAINS AWAY AT THE SIGHT OF THE FALLING STONES) t almost... (SIGHS, DISPIRITED) I almost found my way home.\nLEGIONARY: (MOURNFULLY) The gods cleanse our city with fire. We can only hope that they have no want to take our lives as well.\nMEL: You're right. And... and thank you. Thank you for saving me. I could have been scalded or... or suffocated out there.\nLEGIONARY: With the blessing of Isis, this trial may soon be over. We can go about our business again. Until then, we can but wait.\nMEL: (IGNORING HIM; TO SELF, MISERABLY) And even if I\nMEL: 208\nMEL: had got to the TARDIS, I couldn’t have got inside it without the Doctor. Now I can’t even get out of the city. It’s too late.\nMEL: 45. OUTSIDE THE AMPHITHEATRE\nMEL: THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE, BUT WE CAN HEAR SCREAMS FROM NEARBY STREETS. THE DOCTOR AND VALERIA RUN\nTOWARDS: US, AND TAKE SHELTER.\nVALERIA: (OUT OF BREATH) Here, Doctor, here! We can take cover beneath the portico of the house of Julia Felix.\nDOCTOR: (SAME) Yes, yes, an excellent idea, Valeria. (STOPS;\nDOCTOR: TRIES TO GET HIS BREATH BACK) How’s your foot now?\nVALERIA: It feels much better.\nDOCTOR: Good — because we can’t stay here for long.\nVALERIA: Murranus and the other gladiators have not followed us. pOcTOR: It’s not Murranus I’m worried about.\nVALERIA: (AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, AWED) It is scarcely\nVALERIA: believable, Doctor. The ash, the fire... that great cloud covering the sky. You... you are all that has been claimed of you.\nDOCTOR: (STARTLED) I’m sorry?\nVALERIA: That the mirmillo’s attack upon you should bring such divine wrath down upon our heads.\nDOCTOR: This has nothing to do with me, Valeria, 1 promise you. This is an entirely natural phenomenon.\nVALERIA: Natural? How can it be natural? It is the middle of the\nVALERIA: day, and yet a great darkness has descended. Fire falls from the sky. Vesuvius must be a gateway to the underworld itself.\nDOCTOR: It’s a voleano, Valeria. Just a volcano.\nVALERIA: No, Doctor. We have lived beneath the mountain’s slopes for generations. Pompeii was settled —\nDOCTOR: Pompeii was built on an outcrop formed by lava from\nDOCTOR: the voleano’s last eruption, a thousand years ago. Vesuvius has been dormant for a long time, Valeria - but it’s making up for it now.\nVALERIA: You cannot stop it?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t come from Isis. The eruption has nothing to do with me. I just seem to be in the wrong place at the right time, as usual. Nature will run its course, as it always does. Nobody can stop it.\nVALERIA: Then we are truly doomed.\nDOCTOR: You mustn't think like that. Listen to me. I can explain what’s happening; what will happen. I can give you — give both of us - a fighting chance to survive this.\nVALERIA: I fear that may not be possible.\nDOCTOR: You're wrong, Valeria. This downpour will continue for twelve hours. It will bury Pompeit in a layer of ash six feet deep. Many people will abandon their homes and flee. Many others will stay, taking shelter indoors. They’re the ones who will die.\nVALERIA: How can that be?\nDOCTOR: They can survive the ash ~ but they won't survive what happens next: a pyroclastic flow, a virtual river of boiling hot rock, pouring down the mountainside at a speed of one hundred miles per hour. It will engulf the city, killing everyone it touches. We can’t outrun it, Valeria. We can't hide from it. Thousands will die in Pompeii alone.\nDOCTOR: 209\nVALERIA: But if the ash is to fall until then, how can we flee? We will suffocate on the very air, if we are not scorched or beaten to death\nVALERIA: by stones.\nDOCTOR: It won’t be easy, but it’s our only hope.\nVALERIA: You say you are not a messenger of the gods, Doctor. How is it that you Know so much of their intentions?\nDOCTOR: I know the workings of Nature, Valeria, and of Time. I know that, twelve hours from now, this city will no longer exist.\nVALERIA: Then this is Pompeii’s fate: to be judged by the gods and found wanting; to be removed from the face of the earth.\nDOCTOR: Pompeii will rise again, Valeria, one day.\nDOCTOR: (MOURNFULLY) But that day will be many years from now, I’m afraid. None of you — none of us — will live to see it.\nDOCTOR: 46. A POMPEIAN STREET THE VOLCANO IS STILL BELCHING OUT ASH, BUT THERE ARE FAR\nFEWER: STONES NOW. MEL MAKES TO BREAK COVER.\nLEGIONARY: My lady, what are you doing?\nMEL: I’ve made up my mind. I can’t just stay here —- no matter how hopeless it seems.\nLEGIONARY: You must.\nMEL: I suppose I'm under arrest, am I?\nLEGIONARY: What does it matter now? You cannot survive out there.\nMEL: [ve got to try. Look, I'm grateful for your concern,\nMEL: really I am, but I've got to go. I know it’s dangerous, but I'll just have to take that risk.\nLEGIONARY: How will you see? The sky is black and the air thick with ash.\nMEL: Tcan find my way... 1 think. (TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF) It's not too far now. Just around that corner and across one road. I can stay under shelter for most of the way. And there aren't as many stones falling now. I can put this stola up over my head and make a run for it.\nLEGIONARY: This is madness.\nMEL: You're probably right. (TAKES A DEEP BREATH) So, you'd better wish me luck, hadn’t you?\nSHE: MAKES A RUN FOR IT.\nSHE: 4'7.A POMPEIAN STREET\nSHE: THE DOCTOR AND VALERIA RUN THROUGH THE STREETS, BUT COME TO REST BENEATH ANOTHER PORTICO.\nVALERIA: (COUGHING) It is no use, Doctor. ] cannot keep going. This ash blinds me. It claws at my throat so I can hardly draw breath.\nDOCTOR: (OUT OF BREATH) There won’t be a better chance than\nDOCTOR: this, Valeria. There aren’t as Many pumice stones now, but the voleano will keep belching out hot ash. Stay here for a few minutes. Rest. But then we must move on.\nVALE: (SAME) You would do better without me to slow you wn.\nDOCTOR: There’s no point in trying to be noble. I need you. I need\nDOCTOR: 210\nDOCTOR: your knowledge of this city. You have to steer us towards a gate.\nVALERIA: I must return home first.\nDOCTOR: There isn’t —\nVALERIA: CINSISTENTLY> You say that Pompeii will be buried. What of my house? What of my possessions?\nDOCTOR: They aren’t important, Valeria. Not compared to your life.\nVALERIA: (THINKS, THEN DRAWS A DEEP BREATH) Very well. I trust you, Doctor. I will do what you think is best.\nDOCTOR: (RELIEVED) So, where to now?\nVALERIA: This way. We will go down to the shore.\nDOCTOR: No. The tide will be against us.\nDOCTOR: ‘VALERIA: But if a boat cannot carry us away from this, what can? No horse could be calmed enough to brave this storm\nDOCTOR: We'll have to remain on foot, I'm afraid.\nVALERIA: But... do you not have a boat yourself? A... a ship. You spoke of it at my bar. It seemed important to you.\nDOCTOR: It is. More important than you can know. But I don’t\nDOCTOR: know how to find it, I’ve run out of time. So, I only have one option. I promised a friend I wouldn’t die here. I’m going to try to keep that promise. (TO SELF, SADLY) I only hope she got far enough away from Pompeii to return the favour.\nDOCTOR: 48. THE HOUSE OF EUMACHIA WE CAN STILL HEAR THE ROAR OF THE VOLCANO AS ASH RAINS\nDOWN: OUTSIDE. INSIDE, MEL CONFRONTS EUMACHIA.\nEUMACHIA: c(ANGRILY) How dare you burst unannounced into my house! Why are you not still in gaol?\nMEL: Well, perhaps not everyone is taken in by your lies.\nEUMACHIA: I know not what you speak of, girl.\nMEL: I’ve come to get our property back.\nEUMACHIA: I have nothing of yours. Rather, it is vice versa.\nMEL: You're not fooling anyone, Eumachia. It's just you and\nMEL: me now, and you know precisely what I mean. The blue box. The Doctor's ‘temple’, as you keep calling it. You moved it, didn’t you? What have you done with it?\nEUMACHIA: Oh, but you have some nerve, to come here and hurl your accusations at me. Do you not care that your sins and your blasphemous lies have brought this rain of fire upon our city?\nMEL: You're unbelievable! You're trying to blame the Doctor and me for all this?\nEUMACHIA: You are to blame. You and all the heathens who have turned their backs upon the true religion for the sake of the foreign interloper. (SHRILLY) This is what your Isis brings to Pompeii. Damnation and death!\nMEL: PUSHES PAST HER.\nMEL: What are you doing, girl?\nMEL: I’ve had enough of this. I’m searching your house.\nEUMACHIA: ‘You have no right! I will call my slaves. I will have you thrown from my premises. Stay out of — A PUMICE STONE PENETRATES THE ROOF AND HITS THE GROUND\nEUMACHIA: 2it\nEUMACHIA: NEXT TO HER.\nEUMACHIA: (A SHRIEK OF TERROR; THEN, STRIDENTLY) Do you see? Do you see now? The gods observe the evil that you do in this house; they send the boiling stones even through my own roof to punish you.\nMEL: I think you'll find that stone fell a lot closer to you, actually.\nEUMACHIA: My gods will protect me, girl. You cannot say the same.\nMEL: dust show me where the TARDIS is, Bumachia, and I’ll\nMEL: get out of your way — before the ‘gods’ do any more damage to your roof.\nEUMACHIA: = You will not find it here.\nMEL: But you did take it, didn't you?\nMEL: EUMAGCHIA. I took your temple, aye. But I was not so foolish as to bring that blasphemous object into my house.\nMEL: So, where did you hide it?\nEUMACHIA: I will not tell you.\nMEL: Your wool market! No, that would be too public. It must\nMEL: be somewhere else. Somewhere like... (REALISES) somewhere like the necropolis, outside the city walls. Your family’s tomb! (SEEING EUMACHIA'S REACTION) I’m right, aren’t I? You hid the TARDIS in your family’s tomb.\nEUMACHIA: Believe that if you wish, girl. But the gods will strike you dead before you can cross even half of Pompeii.\nMEL: We'll just have to see about that, won't we?\nMEL: 49, A POMPEIAN STREET\nMEL: THE STREET IS PACKED WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE. THE DOCTOR AND VALERIA ARE AMONG THEM. THEY HAVE TO SHOUT OVER THE CROWD AND THE ROAR OF THE VOLCANO —- AND THEY\nHAVE: SOME DIFFICULTY BREATHING.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Valeria, keep going. How far to the gate now? ‘VALERIA: We are almost upon it, But we must still cross the fields beyond, and there will be no buildings there; no shelter if we falter. Anc my foot is slowing me... both of us down!\nDOCTOR: One problem at a time. Concentrate on reaching the gate. You’re doing well, Valeria.\nDOCTOR: THEY RUN INTO CELSINUS AND AGLAE.\nCELSINUS: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Mr Celsinus. I’m glad you had the sense to leave.\nVALERIA: Decurione,\nAGLAE: Doctor! It is good to see you again. I feared you dead.\nDOCTOR: (WORRIED) Aglae... what are you doing here?\nAGLAE: We tried to do as you instructed, Doctor, but we couldn't get out of the city. We were captured and\nAGLAE: brought back here.\nCELSINUS: The girl is with me. I swore to your friend Melanie that I will see her come to no harm.\nDOCTOR: Where is Mel? What’s happened to her?\nCELSINUS: She went in search of Bumachia.\nDOCTOR: T've got to find her.\nDOCTOR: 212\nVALERIA: Wait, Doctor. You cannot go back.\nDOCTOR: I must, Valeria. I have to find Mel.\nVALERIA: You ignore your own advice. If your friend is sensible, then she will have fled Pompeii by one of the other gates.\nDOCTOR: Unless she thinks she can find me. Or the TARDIS.\nCELSINUS: C(APOLOGETICALLY) I did not wish to leave her, Doctor, but she is very -\nDOCTOR: I know, Celsinus. It’s all right.\nCELSINUS: I will come with you.\nDOCTOR: There’s no need, really.\nCELSINUS: But perhaps it is for the best. Our city is being destroyed. Perhaps it is the gods’ will that we should die with it.\nDOCTOR: No, Celsinus. And that goes for all of you. This isn’t the end. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but life will go on. Even Pompeii will be rebuilt, on a different site. I want you all to promise me that you'll be here to see it.\nVALERIA: But Doctor —\nAGLAE: The Doctor is wise, mistress. We ought to do as he says.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Aglae. Keep running. Don’t turn back.\nVALERIA: Good luck, Doctor.\nCELSINUS: May Isis bring you the best of fortune. THE DOCTOR IS ALREADY STARTING TO HURRY AWAY.\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, all of you. And good luck to you too.\nDOCTOR: 50, THE HOUSE OF EUMACHIA AS MEL HURRIBS THROUGH THE ENTRANCE HALL, SHE IS INTERCEPTED BY EUMACHIA’S SLAVE (FROM SCENE 2).\nSLAVE: (FURTIVELY> My lady! My lady!\nMEL: What? Oh, it’s you. You're Eumachia’s servant, aren’t you? You saw us arriving yesterday.\nSLAVE: I saw your temple, yes, my lady - and I know where it is now.\nMEL: You do? Where is it? Is it in Eumachia’s tomb?\nSLAVE: That is where the mistress had us take it, my lady,\nSLAVE: concealed in a wagon —- but then she changed her orders. She feared that, were someone to look inside the tomb and find the temple, her guilt would be clear.\nMEL: So, what did you do with it?\nSLAVE: We took the temple to the tomb of another family.\nMEL: Which one? Please tell me.\nSLAVE: I know not, my lady, for I am but a poor slave. I cannot read the —\nMEL: CORGENTLY) Can you show me?\nSLAVE: T must not. Eumachia has commanded all her servants\nSLAVE: to remain with her.\nMEL: She's keeping you all here? She can't!\nSLAVE: I must go, my lady. Eumachia would flog me if she knew I was even speaking to you.\nMEL: The ods won't protect her, you know. She'll die, and she'll take everyone who stays in this building with her.\nMEL: THE SLAVE IS ALRBADY BACKING AWAY NERVOUSLY.\nMEL: 213\nMEL: SLAVE. (AFRAID) I must go, my lady.\nMEL: (CINSISTENTLY) Why don’t you stand up to her? Just walk out. You don’t want to die for her sake, do you?\nSLAVE: The tomb you seek is near the Nucerian gate, my lady. Now, I must return to my mistress. (BEAT; THEN, HESITANTLY) I hope you may speak well of me to Isis.\nSLAVE: HE FLEES BACK INTO THE HOUSE PROPER.\nMEL: (TO SELF, DESPONDENTLY) Oh, I wish I could. I wish I could help you. I wish there was time to help everyone.\nSHE: LINGERS FOR A SECOND LONGER, THEN TURNS AND RUNS OUT OF THE HOUSE.\nSHE: 51. THE GLADIATORIAL BARRACKS WE CAN STILL HEAR THE VOLCANO OUTSIDE. MURRANUS ADDRESSES A CROWD OF GLADIATORS (SIXTY-TWO, TO BE PRECISE).\nMURRANUS: Hear me, my fellow gladiators. Many of you have had your say as to what should be done; now I, Murranus, shall have mine. There is no doubt that the gods have turned against Pompeii. They send fire from the sky to cleanse the sin from our city. But I tell you, this is no more than a test!\nSOME: GLADIATORS REACT WITH SUPPORTIVE CHEERS; SOME AREN’T SO SURE, AND THERE MURMURS OF DISCONTENT.\nSOME: The gods would know who is worthy to serve them;who has faith enough to stand strong. Well, I tell you this: we, of all Pompeians, have nought to fear. Have we not served our gods well? Have we not entertained them and honoured them with displays of skill and courage?\nGENERAL: PROUD AGREEMENT.\nGENERAL: Some of you speak of abandoning our great. city; of joining the craven masses who flee like frightened cattle. Well, I tell you this: your cowardice will bring disgrace upon our proud profession! THERE ARE MORE CHEERS THAN JEERS AT THIS.\nGENERAL: Some of us have braved the ashes already to return here to the barracks. We have proven that there is nought to fear for the bold of heart and strong of limb. Here, then, we should stay — and, when this catastrophe is spent and the citizens return, ashamed, to their homes, they will say at least that their gladiators had faith and courage enough to weather the storm. They will honour us and respect us as is our due.\nGENERAL: A MORE STRIDENT ROAR OF AGREEMENT.\nGENERAL: If anyone here disputes that — if anyone would still turn tail and flee - then let him speak now. CN A LOWER, THREATENING GROWL) Let him argue his case with me.\nNOBODY: SPEAKS UP.\nNOBODY: $2. THE CITY GATE\nNOBODY: CELSINUS AND AGLAK, STILL PART OF A LARGE AND FRIGHTENED CROWD, REACH THE GATE.\nAGLAE: Decurione! Decurione, where is Valeria Hedone? We have lost her. We have lost her!\nAGLAE: 214\nCELSINUS: I cannot see her, Aglae - but, with the ash and the crowd, she could be mere inches away. You must not trouble yourself. Valeria will do as the Doctor has said: she will leave Pompeii to its fate. We must do the same.\nAGLAB: But what if she has turned back? What if she has chosen to find the Doctor and Mel?\nCELSINUS: We cannot concern ourselves with her, child. Here: we have attained the gate at last. We may survive this ordeal yet.\nAGLAE: But there is still far to go, decurione, and the ash fills my mouth and pulls at my feet. I do not think I can go on.\nCELSINUS: I will not leave you behind.\nAGLAE: I will only slow you down. Why would a man such as you risk your life for one such as I?\nCELSINUS: I made a promise, Aglae. I swore to Melanie that I would see us both safe. And I will keep that promise... whatever it takes. THEY STRUGGLE ONWARDS.\nCELSINUS: 53. THE HOUSE OF EUMACHIA\nEUMACHIA: RUNS FRANTICALLY THROUGH HER HOUSE AS STONES\nCRASH: THROUGH THE ROOF.\nEUMACHIA: My slaves! My slaves, attend me! The stones burst through my very roof. Look! Look at the damage they have wrought to my statue. You! Yes, you! I ordered you to carry this down to the cellar, where it would be safe. Now see what your indolence has caused. Take it. Take it now and you, you must rescue my precious paintings. If more harm is done, then I will take it out of your hides!\nSLAVES: SCURRY AROUND HER FEET, LIFTING PRECIOUS ITEMS AND\nCARRYING: THEM AWAY.\nSLAVE: CNERVOUSLY) Should you not take sheiter yourself, Mistress?\nEBUMACHIA: I need no protection.\nSLAVE: But mistress...\nEUMACHIA: Our city has been found wanting. Pompeii welcomed in the foreign goddess and we have been damned for it. But I have remained faithful. [ worship the true gods. Jupiter, Juno and Minerva will not abandon Eumachia to die with the heathens. I will be spared as all around me becomes dust!\nANOTHER: STONE CRASHES THROUGH THE ROOF. WE CAN HEAR THE\nVOLCANO: VERY CLEARLY NOW.\nVOLCANO: 54. OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE OF ISIS THERE AREN’T MANY PEOPLE LEFT THIS DEEP INTO THE CITY. MEL\nSTUMBLES: BLINDLY THROUGH THE STREETS.\nMEL: (CHOKING AND SPLUTTERING ON ASH) Help! Help! Can somebody help me? You, over there! No, please come back. Help me! It’s too dark. I can't find my way. Somebody, help me! (SURRENDERS TO A\nCOUGHING: FIT)\nCOUGHING: THE DOCTOR APPROACHES AT A RUN.\nDOCTOR: Mel! Mei, is that you?\nMEL: (SPLUTTERS) Doctor?\nMEL: 215\nMEL: HE REACHES HER. (RECOVERING; ENORMOUSLY RELIEVED) Oh, Doctor! It’s so good to see you.\nDOCTOR: You too, Mel. You too.\nMEL: We couldn’t get away. We reached the gate, but the guard —\nDOCTOR: I know, Mel.\nMEL: Doctor... I know where the TARDIS is.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nMEL: It’s in a tomb, outside the Nucerian gate... wherever that is.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s over in this direction. No, wait a minute... if this ig the Temple of Isis... and the Forum is over that way...\nMEL: (BECOMING DISPIRITED AGAIN) It’s no use, is it\nMEL: Doctor? We'll never find our way through all this - and even if we did, we'd have to search all the tombs to find the right one. It’s too dark, I can hardly breathe and the ash is already knee deep. You were right, Doctor. History's working against us. This is the end, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: It’s the end for Pompeii, Mel. (BECOMING DISTANT, REFLECTIVE) Inside that temple now, the priests of Isis are sitting down to their last meal: one final tribute to a goddess who won't save them. That’s how they’ll be found, many years from now, their corpses petrified, preserved by the ash, their food still laid out on the table. MEL And us? Will they find our bodies too, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) There’s always a chance, Mel. You told me that, remember? HE HURRIES OVER TO THE WALL OF THE TEMPLE COURTYARD.\nMEL: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (HIS VOICE STRAINED AS HE REACHES UP) Just borrowing this hanging-lamp from the temple wall. I don’t think they’lL be needing it any more, do you? HE RUMMAGES IN HIS POCKETS, FINDS A MATCH, LIGHTS IT AND LIGHTS THE LAMP FROM IT.\nDOCTOR: There. At least now we can see a little better.\nMEL: Until the ash puts out the flame.\nDOCTOR: If that happens, we’ll just re-light it. I was wrong, Mel. You were right. You had hope. Sometimes, that’s the most important thing of all.\nMEL: So, what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: Whatever it takes, Mel. Whatever we can, to find the TARDIS and escape from Pompeii.\nMEL: And the Laws of Time?\nDOCTOR: We'll worry about them later. (SPIRITEDLY) Come along Mel, we've no time to lose.\nMEL: (GLADLY) I’m right behind you, Doctor.\nMEL: THEY RUN INTO THE DISTANCE TOGETHER. THE SCREAMS OF THE\nPOMPEIANS: FADE AND, FOR A WHILE, WH HEAR JUST THE SOUNDS OF THE CONTINUING ERUPTION UNTIL THEY FINALLY FADE INTO...\nPOMPEIANS: SS. THE RUINS OF POMPEII, 1980 AS SCENE 1. THE DOCTOR AND MEL STROLL TOWARDS US.\nPOMPEIANS: 216\nMEL: It’s hard to believe it was all so long ago, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Two thousand years do seem to have gone by in a flash.\nMEL: You know what I mean, Doctor. You saw the Street of Plenty back there — and Valeria’s inn, still standing. Well, more or less.\nDOCTOR: Pompeii was buried, Mel; protected from the elements\nDOCTOR: for centuries. People forgot about it ~ forgot its name, even. It was only in the middle of your eighteenth century that excavation work began. Pompeii is still being rediscovered — unearthed and restored - one piece at a time. It is a moment of history preserved like no other.\nMEL: They can bring back the buildings — but they can’t bring back the people, can they?\nDOCTOR: No. They can’t.\nMEL: There was nothing we could have done for them, was there?\nDOCTOR: We were too late, Mel. It had already happened.\nMEL: (SIGHS) Yes, 1 know. I suppose we should just be\nMEL: grateful that it didn’t happen to us too. For a while there, I thought we were never going to find cur way back to the TARDIS. (BEAT) Do you think they survived, Doctor? I mean, Aglae and Celsinus and Valeria.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Mel. Many people died. Thousands of bodies were found within the city walls, preserved in cavities in the ash. They told the historians of your time far more about their Roman ancestors than they could ever have hoped to learn otherwise.\nMEL: But those were the ones who stayed, weren't they? Thousands more must have evacuated. What happened to them?\nDOCTOR: They were fighting their way through a heavy shower of\nDOCTOR: volcanic ash, Mel. Some would have been lucky. Others would have died. From this point in time, there’s no way of knowing the fate of any one of them. (GENTLY) I prefer to believe the best until I see proof to the contrary.\nDOCTOR: THEY WALK ON IN CONTEMPLATIVE SILENCE FOR A FEW SECONDS.\nMEL: (TAKES A DEEP BREATH; TRIES TO BE CHEERFUL) 1 must say, it is nice to get out in the open air again, after — how long was it; three days almost? — cooped up inside the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I meant to explain that to you.\nMEL: There’s no need, Doctor. I understand perfectly. We had to wait for the ash to well and truly harden around us before we could dematerialise, leaving a police box-shaped hole —\nDOCTOR: - into which I could then guide the TARDIS one thousand, nine hundred and one years later —\nMEL: — in time for it to be uncovered by the earthquake of 1980. This year.\nDOCTOR: After that, it was simply a matter of waiting for the archaeologists to move away from their ‘impossible’ discovery —\nMEL: —and then we could come outside. So, UNIT will be called in after all. They’ll take the TARDIS away —\nDOCTOR: — they’ll tell my former self about it —\nMEL: — and then, when all the fuss has died down —\nDOCTOR: We'll simply stroll into UNIT’s Italian headquarters and\nDOCTOR: take e my ship back without fear of creating a paradox. It’s still cheating though, isn't it? I mean, we've still sat ‘our foreknowledge to change things.\nDOCTOR: 217\nDOCTOR: But we haven't altered the events that created our foreknowledge. That's the important difference.\nMEL: If you say so.\nDOCTOR: As I said, it's only cheating if you get caught.\nMEL: (GROANS WITH MOCK DISAPPROVAL) Oh, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (CHEERFULLY) Come on, Mel. Let’s explore.\nMEL: STOPS HIM.\nMEL: (IN A HUSHED VOICE) Ssh! Doctor, I think there’s\nMEL: someone coming.\nMEL: THEY TAKE COVER AS TWO PAIRS OF FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ACROSS RUBBLE.

It’s disastrous! An archaeological disaster! Pompeii is our window on the Roman world, you know. A window! Thanks to the eruption of Vesuvius, this city was preserved like no other, just waiting for us to revive it and learn its secrets. It has survived looters, tourists, vandals... and now, for nature itself to do this..\nUNIT OFFICER: I’m sure you're doing everything you can, Professor. THEY COME TO A HALT.\nUNIT OFFICER: But this, 1 assume, is what we're here for.\nARCHAEOLOGIST: Yes, yes, this is the artefact. We haven't completed our excavations of this region, you see. The artefact was uncovered by the earthquake. It...\nUNIT OFFICER: Could somebody have put it here? As some sort of a prank?\nARCHAEOLOGIST: Oh, goodness, no. As you can see, it is still partially buried under volcanic ash. No, the only way it could have arrived in its present position is if it was placed there before Mount Vesuvius erupted.\nUNIT OFFICER: Which was when, exactly?\nARCHAEOLOGIST: AD 79. Almost two thousand years ago — which, as you can see, is impossible. Quite impossible.\nUNIT OFFICER: Indeed. (BRUSQUELY) OK, Professor, I’m taking custody of this artefact. I'll have men down here within the hour.\nARCHAEOLOGIST: You want to dig it out? But...\nUNIT OFFICER: I have to ask you not to speak to anyone about this. You will be required to sign a declaration to that effect. A representative of your government will be in touch shortly.\nARCHAEOLOGIST: I don't understand. Is the artefact dangerous?\nARCHAEOLOGIST: 297\nUNIT OFFICER: I’m sorry, Professor, this is UNIT business now.

That’s garbage!\nDOCTOR: (A WARNING GROWL) Ace.\nACE: You don’t have to bow and scrape to us, mate — or anyone else, for that matter. You tell him, professor.\nDOCTOR: What my companion is trying to say is that we aren’t going to punish you. We are simply, ah, messengers.\nSLAVE: Is Isis then displeased with our offerings?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, no, nothing like that. However, we would like to keep our presence here a secret — if you could perhaps...?\nSLAVE: I swear, lord, I will speak of this to no one.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. Well, run along now. No, wait! One more thing.\nDOCTOR: We've been travelling for some time, and we seem to have lost track of the date. It’s silly, I know, but I wonder if you could enlighten us?\nSLAVE: Why, it is the day of the Vulcanalia, my lord. The tenth day before the Calends of September.\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY DISTRACTED) Ah. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: THE SLAVE SCURRIES AWAY.\nACE: What was he talking about, professor?\nDOCTOR: He said it’s the twenty-third of August.\nACE: What year? (CALLS) Hey, mate, hang on a minute! What year is it?\nDOCTOR: (BRUSQUELY) Come along, Ace.\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR WALKS AWAY QUICKLY. ACE HURRIES TO KEEP UP WITH HIM.\nACE: But he didn’t tell us what year it is!\nDOCTOR: We can cross the road on these stepping stones. Be careful.\nACE: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Do you want to explore or don’t you?\nACE: What's with you all of a sudden, professor? Where are\nACE: 299\nACE: we? (CALLS AFTER HIM) Professor!\nACE: 4. A POMPEIAN STREET\nACE: THE DOCTOR WALKS ON, ACE A LITTLE WAY BEHIND HIM. THERE ARE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE HERE; WE HEAR THEM WALKING AND\nSOMETIMES: TALKING. AT SOME POINT, AN IRON-WHEELED CART\nMIGHT: TRUNDLE PAST, DRAWN BY TWO HORSES.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERS SADLY) So, this is it. The final journey. I had hoped for a while longer. Time to prepare. Time, slipping away from me.\nACE: (CALLS) This is wicked, professor! An actual Roman\nACE: city. All this stuff looked dead boring when we did it in school, but close\nACE: up...\nDOCTOR: Time marching on. Only just arriving, but we've already stayed a lifetime. Too many lifetimes. Withering like roses...\nSHE: CATCHES UP TO HIM.\nACE: So, do you tell me where we are now, or is this another of your big mysteries?\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry, Ace.\nACE: What for?\nACE: THEY STOP WALKING.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS HEAVILY, COMPOSES HIMSELF) The year is AD\nDOCTOR: 79. The Roman Empire is under the short-lived rule of Titus. We are in the city of Pompeii, a prosperous trading centre on the Bay of Naples. If you look between the buildings there, you can see a certain mountain by the name of Vesuvius.\nACE: Vesuvius! That’s a volcano, isn’t it? Wicked! I’ve never seen a real live volcano before.\nDOCTOR: You may wish you never had.\nACE: It’s gonna go up, isn't it? ] remember that bit all right.\nACE: We made a big model of it in primary school, from papier mache, with all this red stuff gushing out of it. When will it happen? Can we see it, professor? Can we?\nDOCTOR: I think it might be better if we just leave.\nACE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Leave. Go back to the TARDIS.\nACE: 2\nDOCTOR: Because you aren't dressed for this time and place.\nDOCTOR: Because, beneath their sophisticated veneer, the Romans are a quite barbarous people. Because we have an unfortunate habit of attracting\nDOCTOR: trouble. Because this is your history, and no good can come of our meddling in it.\nACE: (SULLENLY) You want to go, then. aoe No. It’s your decision, Ace. It has to be your choice.\nACE: Well... we can look round first, can’t we? I mean, there’s no need for us to rush off, is there?\nDOCTOR: None whatsoever.\nACE: CIRRITABLY) I wish you'd tell me what’s wrong.\nDOCTOR: Nothing's wrong, Ace. Quite the opposite. Events are\nDOCTOR: proceeding precisely as I expect they should.\nACE: That's all right then... I think. THE DOCTOR WALKS OFF. ACE FOLLOWS. WE STAY WITH THEM.\nACE: 300\nACE: So, when does the volcano blow its top?\nDOCTOR: (DOURLY) Vesuvius will erupt, destroying Pompeii and killing thousands of people, at. approximately midday tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: 5. THE STREET OF PLENTY\nNOW: THEY ARE WALKING THROUGH A BUSY SHOPPING CENTRE. THERE'S A FESTIVAL ON. WE HEAR LOTS OF VOICES AND LOTS OF LAUGHTER. SOMEONE PLAYS A SIMPLE TUNE ON A REED PIPE,\nACCOMPANIED: BY CYMBALS OR A RATTLE.\nDOCTOR: The Via dell’Abbondanza. The Street of Plenty.\nACE: Well, there’s plenty of people about.\nDOCTOR: That’s because they're celebrating, Ace. If I remember\nDOCTOR: my history — or rather, your history — correctly, we've arrived in the middle of the Festival of the Divine Augustus.\nACE: I see they’ve invented graffiti by now. It’s all over the place. What does that say? Celadus the Thracian is... sus-pir-ium puell- ar-um?\nACE: potoR: The girls’ heat-throb. Yeah? How about that one?\nACE: DocroR: ‘Polycarbus ran from his opponent in shameful fashion. (SARCASTICALLY) Well witty!\nACE: nooron: It refers to a gladiator, I presume. You can learn a grea\nACE: deal about a culture from its writings.\nACE: You said it was wrong to write on walls.\nDOCTOR: There's a time and a place for everything.\nACE: Great! So, can I have a go?\nDOCTOR: Certainly not.\nACE: Well, how about we go and see this Polly What's-his-\nACE: name?\nDOCTOR: The Amphitheatre wili be closed for the festival.\nDOCTOR: Thankfully. [If you’re looking for entertainment, I'd suggest the theatre or the Odeon.\nACE: (TONGUE-IN-CHEEK) The Odeon? Ace! What films are they showing?\nDOCTOR: No films — but you might enjoy a recital of poetry.\nACE: I'll give it a miss, thanks. (PAUSE) Professor? You see\nACE: that young guy back there? I think he’s following us. He keeps looking over here and...\nHER: VOICE TRAILS OFF, AND THE SOUND OF THE CROWD GROWS LOUDER. SHE HAS LOST HIM.\nHER: (WORRIED) Doctor?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: Spare some asses, dear?\nACE: (STARTLED) Eh?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: Some coins for a homeless old woman?\nACE: Oh. Oh, I see. I’m sorry, I don’t have any money.\nBEGGAR WOMAN: (ANGHILY) What? You claim poverty? You, with your clean face and your neat hair and your clothing of strange fabrics?\nACE: I don't. Reaily, I just...\nBEGGAR WOMAN: You think yourself superior to me, but you are no more than a base dissembler! Why, you are fair laden down with metal\nBEGGAR WOMAN: 301\nBEGGAR WOMAN: trinkets!\nACE: I only just got here, honest! I... I’m... (SUDDENLY REMEMBERS) a messenger from Isis. I'm only here...\nDOCTOR: ...to honour Augustus with a quiet drink.\nACE: (RELIEVED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Come along, Ace.\nACE: Where were you?\nACE: THE DOCTOR HURRIES ACE AWAY. THE BEGGAR WOMAN'S VOICE\nRECEDES: AS SHE SHOUTS AFTER THEM.\nBEGGAR WOMAN: You have not even the decency to cover your head. You are shameless, woman. Shameless!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it’s a good idea to encourage that particular rumour.\nACE: You started it! It’s what you told that slave.\nDOCTOR: He saw the TARDIS materialising. I had no choice.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, Ace, making claims of that nature can be very unwise indeed. I think you should leave the talking to me in future.\nACE: I'm not a kid, you know.\nDOCTOR: No. But you are drawing attention.\nACE: She picked on me!\nDOCTOR: Your clothing is anachronistic. Women should keep their heads covered, and badges are definitely out of season.\nACE: Hey, I'm not the one dressed in question marks!\nDOCTOR: 1 think we should find somewhere a little more private. THEY WALK AWAY FROM US.\nACE: CAGGRIEVED) It’s not fair, professor. Why aren’t people\nACE: staring at your clothes?\nACE: WE HEAR JUST THE SOUNDS OF THE STREET, FOR A MOMENT.\nCELSINUS: Well? What have you learned?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: That you must like the aspect of this stranger a good deal, Popidius Celsinus, that you, (WITH MOCKING GRANDEUR) a member of the municipal council, would pay for the favour of such as I.\nCELSINUS: You try my patience, woman. What did she tell you?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: A more precious secret, perhaps, than can be bought with the few coins you have promised me.\nCELSINUS: (HOTLY) I offer fair recompense for a simple deed, hag! coud you have me talk to the duoviri and have you run out of this city?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: (AMUSED, TAUNTINGLY) I merely find it strange that you know not the answer to your question already.\nCELSINUS: Why say you that?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: The woman comes from Isis, decurione. She is a mnessenger of the goddess. Now, how can it be that you, of all in Pompeii, were not aware of that fact?\nBEGGAR WOMAN: 6. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN\nBEGGAR WOMAN: A SMALL BAR, CROWDED WITH REVELLERS, SOME OF THEM DRUNK AND QUITE ROWDY. ITS FRONT IS OPEN TO THE STREET, SO THE SOUNDS FROM OUTSIDE CAN STILL BE HEARD.\nVALERIA: (CALLS INTO THE STREET) Come, handsome stranger, feast here with your chambermaid. Valeria offers the lowest prices for\nVALERIA: 302\nVALERIA: hot food, and the finest garum in all Rome.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, thank you, I think we will.\nDOCTOR: WE STAY WITH THE DOCTOR, ACH AND VALERIA AS THEY MOVE INTO THE BAR TOGETHER.\nACE: Sounds good to me. But I’m not his...\nDOCTOR: You keep an interesting establishment here, er...?\nVALERIA: Valeria Hedone at your service. You are a stranger to\nVALERIA: Pompeii ~ but a man of good standing, I can see. It will be Falernian wine for you, I'd wager. I ask only four asses for the drink of the emperors.\nDOCTOR: Very reasonable... Ah. But not just yet, I’m afraid. I appear to have left all my coins at home.\nACE: (MUTTERS) This is embarrassing!\nVALERIA: CICILY) Then perhaps you should fetch them, stranger,\nVALERIA: before you waste any more of my time.\nSHE: WALKS OFF.\nACE: I don’t think she’s pleased with you, professor.\nDOCTOR: (BITTERLY> Why are you humans so obsessed with money? (MUTTERS, THOUGHTFULLY) Money, money, money..\nACE: Eww! Those fish aren't even cooked. They're rotting!\nDOCTOR: They're not for eating, Ace.\nACE: So, what are they for?\nDOCTOR: Throwing back into the river.\nACE: It’s a bit late for that, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: It’s a ritual, Ace. Remember what that slave told us?\nDOCTOR: Today is the Vulcanalia. The fish are an offering to Vulcan, the Roman God of Fire and Furnaces. (MUTTERS, THOUGHTFULLY) I always did wonder how that particular custom originated. Perhaps somebody could enlighten me?\nACE: So, it’s Vulean’s day as well as that Divine August bloke’s? Crikey, how many holidays do they have here?\nDOCTOR: The Romans treat their gods very seriously.\nAGE: Yeah, as a serious excuse to stuff themselves... So, this\nAGE: ‘Vulcan bloke’s the ‘God of Fire and Furnaces’, eh? That’s a bit, ironic, isn't it? You know, what with (LOWERS HER VOICE) what’s going on tomorrow, and all that.\nDOCTOR: I doubt if the Pompeians will see the funny side. HE APPROACHES A TABLE AT WHICH PEOPLE ARE PLAYING WITH\nDICE: MADE OUT OF BONE.\nDICE: (HAPPILY) Ah. I think this may be the answer to all our troubles.\nACE: (LOWERS HER VOICE, WARILY) Are you sure, professor? Those blokes look a bit hard to me.\nDOCTOR: (AT NORMAL SPEAKING VOLUME) Gladiators, I expect.\nDOCTOR: But don't worry, Ace, they’re only wielding dice, not swords. Excuse me, gentlemen, I wonder if you might be able to accommodate one more player?\nDOCTOR: You have coins to stake?\nDOCTOR: Ah, no. But I thought you might have a use for... (HF ELONGATES THE WORD ‘FOR’, AS HE RUMMAGES THROUGH POCKETS) this silver, er... yo-yo. No, no, that won’t do at all, will it?\nMUBRANUS: We play for coins or nought. Now, leave. You disturb us.\nMUBRANUS: 303\nACE: I think he means it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, but there must be something I can interest you in.\nMURRANUS: (LAUGHS) I am Murranus, stranger, the greatest mirmillo ever to do battle in Pompeii’s Amphitheatre. What could you offer to me?\nDOCTOR: (PEIGNING DELIGHT) Ah, Murranus! Delighted to meet you. I’ve heard your name spoken, of course. They say you are the most courageous swordsman in the whole of the Empire.\nACE: Much braver than that Polycarbus bloke.\nMURRANUS: You hear right. Why, in the latest games, I vanquished my opponents with ease. Even Crescens, the peopie’s darling, could not withstand my might.\nMURRANUS: THE DOCTOR PULLS BACK A CHAIR AND SITS DOWN.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. And it would be a great honour to dice with such a renowned warrior. I’m the Doctor, by the way.\nMURRANUS: (ANGRILY) I did not give you leave to sit.\nDOCTOR: (HE’S SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF SOMETHING) My maidsepvant!\nMURRANUS: Wow what madness afflicts you?\nDOCTOR: My maidservant. She must be worth... oh, two thousand sesterces at least, wouldn't you say?\nMURRANUS: The girl?\nACE: (HALF-LAUGHING, NOT SURE IF HE’S JOKING OR NOT) Professor!\nDOCTOR: Yes, the girl. What's wrong, Murranus? My wager too\nDOCTOR: rich for Pompeii’s greatest warrior? I will stake the girl against just thirty sesterces.\nMURRANUS: Then you are a fool, Doctor. You must know that the gods wili favour he who fights and wins in their name.\nDOCTOR: Then I take it you accept?\nACE: (URGENT WHISPER) Should I be getting ready to leg it here, or what?\nMURRANUS: Aye, Doctor. I accept!\nDOCTOR: ; Splendid, splendid. Well, then... perhaps you'd like to make the first roll?\nDOCTOR: ’. THE HOUSE OF EUMACHIA\nBUMACHIA: (ANGRILY) Speak, slave! I require an answer. I would know how it is that you should take so long about a simple errand.\nSLAVE: CAFRAID) Forgive me, Mistress Eumachia, 1 am pledged not to Say.\nEUMACHIA: To whom? To whom would you show greater fealty than to your mistress; to she who feeds and clothes and houses you?\nSLAVE: Only to the gods, I swear it.\nBUMACHIA: (SARCASTICALLY) Ah! Then ’twas the Gods who ghetructed your work. Were my husband still alive, he would flog you Sut es!\nSLAVE: ‘Twas their... (MUMBLES, ALMOST INAUDIBLY) their messengers.\nEUMACHIA: Do not mumble so. I cannot hear you.\nEUMACHIA: 304\nSLAVE: Their messengers, mistress. (DESPERATELY) It is the truth, I swear. I would scarce have believed it myself, yet I saw their temple as it fell from the heavens. If you would have me, I can show it to you.\nEUMACHIA: What temple is this, that a priestess of the true religion knows not of it?\nSLAVE: It was sent to us by Isis, mistress.\nEUMACHIA: Isis! Ha — the foreign goddess! Then these (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) messengers be false prophets indeed.\nSLAVE: My lady?\nEUMACHIA: (THOUGHTFULLY) Their deceptions may fool one such as you — but they will not bear the light of the true faith.\nEUMACHIA: 8. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN\nEUMACHIA: A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS HAS GATHERED, AND THE BAR IS QUIETER\nTHAN: BEFORE. TWO BONE DICE ROLL ACROSS A TABLE, AND A\nCOLLECTIVE: GASP IS RAISED.\nDOCTOR: I believe we agreed on thirty sesterces?\nMURRANUS: (BITTERLY) By Jupiter, Doctor, the Lares smile upon you today.\nDOCTOR: Apparently so. AS THE DOCTOR PULLS A NUMBER OF COINS ACROSS THE TABLE TO HIMSELF, THE ONLOOKERS RESUME THEIR CONVERSATIONS.\nDOCTOR: And now, if you'll excuse me...?\nMURRANDS: What is this? Surely you will not take your gains and leave us so soon?\nDOCTOR: Well, time is pressing...\nMURRANUS: (THREATENING) I would test your fortune further, Doctor. I think you will agree, it is only sporting that I be given a chance to recover what I have lost.\nDOCTOR: (RESIGNED) Oh, very well, just a little longer... Ah, Valeria. Valeria, perhaps you could do me a small favour? I’m sure you've noticed how my, ah, maidservant here is dressed. Most. inappropriate. I wonder if you could...?\nCOINS: CHANGE HANDS.\nVALERIA: For this price, Doctor, I will clothe the girl in the finest robes. WE FOLLOW VALERIA AS SHE MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD.\nVALERIA: Aglae? I have another task for you. Take these coins to Vesonius and purchase a stola for the Doctor’s companion. I would say she has your build.\nAGLAE: But, my lady, it is the Festival. My mistress expects my return.\nVALERIA: You will do as I say, girl! Asellina will not miss you for a few minutes more.\nAGLAE: As you wish, my lady.\nAGLAE: WE FOLLOW AGLAE AS SHE HEADS FOR THE DOOR.\nACE: Hey, wait up!\nAGLAE: My lady?\nACE: We can do without that rubbish. My name’s Acs. You're\nACE: Aglae, aren't you? I'm coming with you.\nACE: 305\nAGLAE: But... have you sought permission to leave your master’s side?\nACE: You're joking, aren’t you? Anyway, he’s still playing with his new mates, and I’m bored. Come on. Where are we going first?\nACE: MOVES OFF, BUT AGLAE HESITATES.\nACE: (CALLING BACK TO AGLAE) Well, come on!\nACE: 9. THE STREET OF PLENTY / THE LUPANAR ACE AND AGLAE APPROACH US IN MID-CONVERSATION. THEY ARE LAUGHING.\nACE: I should have brought my nitro-nine with me. I could have shown you.\nAGLAE: (STILL LAUGHING) Oh, Ace, I do not understand some of\nAGLAE: your strange words, but you tell your tales so wonderfully.\nACE: You haven't heard the half of it. THEY COME TO A STOP.\nACE: So, this is where you live, is it?\nAGLAE: This is the Lupanar.\nACE: Nice and central, I see. Right on the main road.\nAGLAE: We do good trade.\nACE: Eh?\nAGLAE: Come in, Ace. With luck, my lady Asellina will have no\nAGLAE: need of me for a time yet, and you may change in my room.\nACE: (WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM) Oh yeah, I can’t wait to slip into this\nACE: toga thing. Hey, hold up a minute! (AMUSED) Are those things what I think they are?\nAGLAE: Of what do you speak, Ace?\nACE: Up there, on the sign. They look like... well, you know...\nAGLAE: (PUZZLED) They bespeak the nature of this establishment.\nACE: A bit forward, isn’t it? CPAUSE) Oh. Does that mean you’re a...? Oh.\nAGLAE: Do you not also serve your master in this manner?\nAGLAE: WE FOLLOW THEM INTO THE LUPANAR, AND ACE SLAMS THE DOOR\nBEHIND: THEM.\nACE: (LAUGHS HOLLOWLY) Oh, great!\nAGLAE: Does something vex you?\nACE: Oh no, nothing at all. The local creep makes a beeline\nACE: for me, so 1 show him I’m not ‘that kind of girl’ by running straight into the local brothel. Nice move or what!\nACE: 10, VALERLA HEDONE’S INN MURRANUS AND HIS THREE GLADIATOR FRIENDS LAUGH UNKINDLY.\nMURRANUS: Again, Doctor, you throw the caniculae. Truly, the fates have deserted you.\nDOCTOR: As you said, the gods favour those who honour them.\nMURRANUS: GATHERS UP HIS COINS. THE DOCTOR PUSHES BACK HIS CHAIR AND STANDS.\nMURRANUS: fa And now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must bid you good ay.\nMURRANUS: 306\nMURRANUS: Hold!\nDOCTOR: You have won all my coins, Murranus.\nMURRANUS: Thirty sesterces did you take from me. Only ten have you staked in return.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. Well, I had to buy clothes for my companion, you see, and...\nMURRANUS: (ANGRILY) You will find something to wager! If you have nought else, then I should like another chance at your maidservant.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I'm afraid she seems to have left. (MUTTERS) You wouldn't like her, anyway. She’s not noted for her obedience.\nMURRANUS: Then the clothes from your back may fetch an as or two.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they would. But, as you said, my luck really isn't holding out. Your, ah, skill at rolling the dice is a little too much for me.\nMURHANUS: JUMPS TO HIS FEET AND UNSHEATHES HI8 SWORD.\nMURRANUS: (LOUDLY AND ANGRILY) Do you accuse Murranus of cheating? I will run you through where you stand!\nSILENCE: FALLS.\nDOCTOR: (HARDLY FLUSTERED) It’s all in the wrist action, of course. But don't worry, I shan’t hold a grudge. I just wish to find my companion...\nDOCTOR: A VIOLENT CRASH, AS MURRANUS HURLS THE TABLE ASIDE TO GET TO THE DOCTOR. THE SILENCE IS BROKEN, AS ONLOOKERS REACT WITH FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT.\nMURRANUS: You seem well versed in the ways of the cheat, Doctor. Could it be that \"tis you who have won your coins unfairly?\nVALERIA: (FORCEFULLY, UNAFRAID) Gentlemen, stop this!\nMURRANUS: It will stop when I have satisfaction!\nMURRANUS: THE DOCTOR PUSHES A CHAIR ASIDE AND RUNS. WITH A SNARL,\nMURRANUS: LEAPS ON HIM. GRUNTS AND GROANS FROM BOTH AS THERE IS A BRIEF SCUFFLE. A CHAIR IS UPTURNED.\nVALERIA: I will not have this brawling in my inn, do you hear? THE DOCTOR GASPS AS MURRANUS GETS AN ARM AROUND HIS NECK.\nMURRANUS: Worry not, Valeria. This imp will trouble us no more — not once I have crushed the life from his body!\nMURRANUS: A STRANGULATED CRY FROM THE DOCTOR.\nMURRANUS: 11. THE LUPANAR / THE STHEET OF PLENTY ACE AND AGLAE CLATTER DOWN A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS.\nACE: Am I wearing this the right way round? It’s uncomfortable.\nAGLAE: You should not wear your old garments beneath the stola.\nACE: There's a lot of my history pinned to this jacket. I’m not losing it!\nAGLAE: At least you wilt not draw attention now. If fortune\nAGLAE: favours you, then Popidius Celsinus will not spy you again. THEY REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS.\nAGLAE: 307\nACE: (MUTTERS) I’m not bothered about that spotty little\nACE: erv.\nAGLAE: OPENS A DOOR, AND THEY EMERGE ONTO THE STREET OF PLENTY, WHERE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. THE CROWD ARE SILENT, BUT FOR AWE-STRUCK GASPS AND MURMURS.\nAGLAE: What's going on out here, then?\nAGLAE: I do not...(EXCITEDLY) Oh! Look, Ace! Look over there!\nACE: CIN A HORRIFIED WHISPER) Vesuvius!\nAGLAE: Oh, is it not magnificent? Smoke rises from the mountain. It can only have come from the furnace of Vulcan himself.\nACE: (WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM) Vulcan. Yeah, right.\nACE: A DISTANT RUMBLING STARTS UP. IT GROWS LOUDER.\nAGLAE: He acknowledges Pompeii’s offerings to him. Perhaps we are not so out of favour with the gods as we have feared.\nACE: (WORRIED) Agiae... Aglae, what is it? What... (CRIES OUT) no!\nACE: THE CROWD REACTS AS THE RUMBLING GROWS LOUDER STILL AND THE EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE. No, it can’t be happening yet. It can’t!\nACE: 18. VALERIA HEDONE’S INN THE TREMOR CONTINUES. POTS SMASH ON THE FLOOR. PEOPLE\nREACT: FEARFULLY, AS ON THE STREET. THE DOCTOR BREAKS FREE.\nMURRANUS: (A GRUNT OF PAIN AND SURPRISE)\nDOCTOR: (A GASP OF RELIEF)\nMURRANUS: FALLS ONTO A TABLE AND BREAKS IT.\nMURRANUS: (A LITTLE SHAKILY) Oh dear, you appear to have slipped.\nVALERIA: Enough, I say! Is it not trial enough that the earth betrays us, without that you continue this behaviour?\nMURRANUS: (ANGRILY) Confour.d you, cheat! The gods themselves keep me from snapping your neck - but they will not save you twice.\nVALERIA: You! Get out of here, now!\nDOCTOR: Delighted to.\nVALERIA: Go on, run! (WARNINGLY) No, Murranus, I care not\nVALERIA: about your reputation. If you wish to settle your differences, then you will find a place other than mine in which to do it, or you will settle them with mel\nMURRANUS: I shall do just that, once this infernal quake has ended. if this Doctor has any wit about him, he will leave Pompeii before I find him - for he shall not have the chance after.\nMURRANUS: 15. THE STREET OF PLENTY\nMURRANUS: THE TREMOR CONTINUES. A FRIGHTENED HORSE HAS TO BE CALMED\nMURRANUS: oO nce AND AGLAE SHOUT TO EACH OTHER IN STRAINED\nAGLAE: Be not afraid, Ace. Hold on to me. This earthquake is not such a bad one, I think. It will soon end.\nACE: ‘You mean this sort of thing happens a lot?\nAGLAE: ‘Tis the gods’ way of showing us their displeasure.\nAGLAE: 308\nAGLAE: THE QUAKE SUBSIDES. PEOPLE PICK THEMSELVES UP, WITH A\nGENERAL: OUTPOURING OF RELIEF.\nGENERAL: You see? There has been no real damage. This was but a warning. We shall have to honour our gods more diligently.\nACE: You’re not making sense. One minute, Vulcan's pleased with you — the next, you've got his mates cheesed off!\nAGLAE: “Tis true, I fear, that the earth shakes more often and\nAGLAE: more violently these past weeks. None can remember such ill omens since the upheaval of seventeen years since.\nACE: Then why doesn't somebody do something? Doesn't anyone realise what’s happening?\nAGLAE: We observe the rituals, we make offerings, we pray to be\nAGLAE: forgiven. What else can we do?\nACE: IS DUMBFOUNDED FOR A MOMENT. THEN THE DOCTOR BREEZES PAST.\nACE: pocToR: Ah, there you are, Ace. Yes, very fetching. Thank you for your help, Aglae. Come along, Ace.\nACE: Dostor...?\nDOCTOR: (HE HAS PASSED HER NOW; HE CALLS BACK TO HER)\nDOCTOR: There are at least two good reasons why we ought to be somewhere else.\nACE: (CALLS) Well, hold up then! (TO AGLAF) Er.,. thanks for everything, Aglae. Nice meeting you, and, er... see you around. Maybe.\nACE: 14, A POMPEIAN STREET IN A QUIETER AREA, ACE CATCHES UP WITH THE DOCTOR.\nACE: It's the volcano, isn’t it, professor? Causing the earthquakes?\nDOCTOR: I take it you’re not quite so excited now.\nACE: It’s horrible! This city... these people... Aglae! Valeria! They're all going to die, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: Many of them, yes.\nACE: Can’t we do something?\nDOCTOR: Against Nature? No. Against Time? Certainly not. This happened a long time ago, Ace. We can't change it.\nACE: It's not fair!\nDOCTOR: It never is.\nDOCTOR: THEY COME TO A HALT.\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) Do you want to leave now, Ace?\nSHE: THINKS ABOUT IT FOR A FEW SECONDS.\nACE: Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.\nACE: 15. A POMPELAN BACK STREET\nACE: A FEW PEOPLE ARE MILLING ABOUT, TALKING IN CONCERNED TONES. HEAVY STONES ARE BEING SHIFTED. THE DOCTOR AND ACE APPROACH.\nACE: ..80, you did cheat, then? Just on that first roll.\nDOCTOR: I observed our gladiator friend’s technique and used it against him.\nDOCTOR: 309\nACE: Sounds like cheating to me.\nDOCTOR: It’s only cheating if you get caught.\nACE: Oh yeah, whereas you got clean away with... (WORRIED) Doctor... Doctor, what's going on?\nDOCTOR: (MURMURS, UPSET) No. No, this can’t be how it ends. THEY RUN FORWARDS TOGETHER.\nACE: This can’t be the right place! It isn’t, is it, professor?\nDOCTOR: I should have known. We should have turned back as soon as I realised...\nACE: It was the earthquake, wasn’t it? It brought that building down, and the TARDIS... the TARDIS was right underneath it!\nDOCTOR: .. but how could 1? Time marching on. The future laid out before me. We've already stayed a lifetime.\nACE: Doctor, tell me we can get the TARDIS back. I mean, it’s\nACE: just a few lumps of concrete, right? Look — those slaves are clearing the wreckage already. We can dig it out, can’t we? We can get away before... before...\nDOCTOR: Tm sorry, Ace.\nDOCTOR: HE WALKS AWAY SLOWLY.
