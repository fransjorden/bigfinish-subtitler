We could search these ruins for days and not find them.\nREED: Hang on. What's that?\nSTEWART: Some sort of blue box appearing out of thin air.\nREED: Something to do with the escaped agents?\nSTEWART: Can't be a coincidence. Let’s get under cover.\nMEL: Doctor, what’s happen (silence) happening?\nDOCTOR: Just some turbulence in the Vortex, Mel.\nMEL: I thought the ship was going to shake itself to pieces, and us with it.\nDOCTOR: I grant you the landing may have been a little on the bumpy side.\nMEL: Bumpy? I’m not inclined to use rude words, Doctor, but if I was I’d use several to describe how bumpy that landing was.\nDOCTOR: We’ve arrived slap-bang er, on target. The Earth colony on the planet Puxatornee in the year 3090, December the 24\".\nMEL: So what are we doing here? And why did we leave the space yacht Pinto in such a hurry?\nDOCTOR: It’s perfectly simple, Mel. This is the only planet in the galaxy where you can find leptonite crystals.\nMEL: Leptonite?\nDOCTOR: If a Quark goes within half a mile of leptonite, it goes berserk and explodes.\nMEL: Oh, I see. So we get the crystals, pop back to the Pinto, and quash the Quarks.\nDOCTOR: Hopefully it won’t come to that, but yes.\nMEL: You're sure this is the right place? It’s all rubble and ruins.\nDOCTOR: It’s very strange. The last time I was here, it was a model of prosperity.\nMEL: And that was?\nDOCTOR: The year Paktafroon Wabstar had their first number one. 3012.\nMEL: Seventy eight years ago. Things are bound to have changed since then.\nDOCTOR: Not for the better, it seems.\nMEL: Mmm, it does look dreadfully grim. The sort of place that would have Edgar Allan Poe reaching for his notebook. What's that noise?\nDOCTOR: The level of background radiation is a shade higher than I would like. What has happened here?\nMEL: You want to explore, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Well, according to the instruments, there’s a leptonite source not far away. We can investigate, I mean, simultaneously. We'd better wrap up, though. It’s snowing heavily out there. Here, put these on.\nMEL: What are they?\nDOCTOR: They protect the wearer against radiation. Come on.\nREED: It’s them, Stewart. It’s them. The Doctor and Mel.\nSTEWART: They’re standing around where anyone could see them.\nREED: Like they wanted to get caught.\nSTEWART: Yes. Maybe they’re not saboteurs after all. Think, Lieutenant. We haven’t heard from the Slithergees for over two decades. No, Reed, they’re here for something else. Power up the vape guns.\nDOCTOR: Listen up.\nMEL: Twelve o’clock. Which means it’s\nDOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Mel.\nMEL: And to you, Doctor. Though I can’t imagine anyone spending a merry Christmas here.\nTANNOY: Greetings, citizens of Puxatornee. This is your President speaking. I would like to wish everyone a sombre retribution day, as we remember our former leader President Bailey.\nMEL: Retribution day?\nDOCTOR: Shh.\nTANNOY: Following the recent disturbance in zone epsilon alpha, all citizens are to remain within their homes. Anyone found outdoors will be reprimanded. Fatally.\nMEL: Reprimanded fatally? Doctor, shouldn’t we go back to\nSTEWART: Stay still! One move and you'll be vaporised.\nREED: You’re coming back to Central Bureau with us, for interrogation.\nMEL: But we haven’t done anything.\nSTEWART: This zone is off-limits, and you’re self-confessed spies.\nMEL: Spies? We’re not spies. And even if we were, we’d hardly be self-confessed ones.\nSTEWART: You’re changing your story. I see. So if you’re not spies, what are you, Doctor, Mel?\nDOCTOR: You know our names?\nSTEWART: You gave them when you were first brought in.\nDOCTOR: We did? That was very cooperative of us.\nREED: You talked about the Professor’s machine.\nMEL: What machine? And what Professor, for that matter?\nREED: Don’t play games. You confessed to everything.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t care to remind us what we confessed to, would you?\nSTEWART: You claimed to be working for the Slithergees.\nMEL: Slithergees? What are Slithergees?\nREED: Hal! You really are insane, aren’t you.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid you have us at a disadvantage. Could you remind us of your names, Mister er?\nSTEWART: Lieutenant Stewart. And this is Lieutenant Reed.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Now perhaps you could accompany us to Central Bureau.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: There’s a lot of explaining to do, and I prefer to do it in a nice, warm atmosphere.\nSTEWART: Get into the snow buggy. Slowly.\nMEL: Doctor, how do they know who we are? And why do they think we’re spies?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. We haven’t been here before.\nMEL: Doctor, maybe we come here at some point in our future, and we’re experiencing the repercussions of things we haven't done yet.\nDOCTOR: It’s a possibility, yes. One of the hazards of time travel is that occasionally you trip over your own footprints. But I have a worrying feeling it may turn out to be even more complicated than that.\nMEL: Well, whatever’s going on, they seem to think we’re up to mischief. The moment we stepped out of the Tardis they were pointing guns at us.\nDOCTOR: (laughs) Yes. So no change there, then.\nMITCHELL: Salute.\nCAPRA: And a merry (ahem) and a grievous retribution day to you.\nMITCHELL: To you too, Professor Capra. Your machine is ready?\nCAPRA: Oh yes, your Presidency. The experiment will commence in one hours time. The culmination of fifteen years work.\nMITCHELL: You still need the assistance of the lieutenants?\nCAPRA: Oh yes, yes, yes. President Mitchell, I was wondering. I've been cooped up like a snow pug in my laboratory for months. Could I possibly see my family one last time before\nMITCHELL: That’s not possible. They were rationalised.\nCAPRA: What!\nMITCHELL: You know how limited supplies are. There was only enough food for one, and as your work was of such importance, you were given priority. You have been living on your family’s allocation, Professor.\nCAPRA: No. No, I won’t help you. I can’t! You’re\nMITCHELL: Evil? No. I make tough decisions and I live with the consequences. My conscience never rests. We must all of us make sacrifices, Professor, and I have merely made one on your behalf. Return to work. Or would you prefer your family to have died in vain?\nCAPRA: Er, yes. Yes, yes, you’re right. The experiment must succeed, for all our sakes.\nMITCHELL: Mitchell.\nSTEWART: [OC]: Salute. President, the Doctor and Mel have been recaptured. Lieutenant Reed and I will resume the interrogation.\nMEL: In quad again. Sometimes I think I’ve seen the inside of more prison cells than I’ve had green salads.\nDOCTOR: Now, let’s see. Ah. Cypher lock. Well, it should only take a couple of oh, that was quick. Sometimes I amaze myself. Oh. Lieutenant Stewart.\nSTEWART: You’re not getting out that easily again, Doctor.\nREED: This door can now only be unlocked from the outside.\nMEL: Well, if you’re intending to hold us captive, that would seem a sensible idea.\nSTEWART: We want to know what you’re doing here on Puxatornee.\nREED: And why you claim to be Slithergee spies.\nMEL: We're not claiming to be spies. After all, if we were spies, we’d hardly make a song and dance about it, would we?\nSTEWART: That’s what makes it so suspicious.\nDOCTOR: I have an idea. If you tell us about these Slithergees, I promise we'll tell you what we’re up to.\nREED: That doesn’t make sense. You must know about the Slithergees.\nDOCTOR: Telling us can’t do any harm, can it?\nREED: About thirty years ago their spaceship appeared in orbit. Their home planet had been destroyed. They were refugees.\nSTEWART: Refugees who travelled in a heavily armed battlecruiser.\nREED: They delivered an ultimatum to our President, Bailey. She could either give them one of our moons or risk starting a war.\nMEL: And so she decided to start a war?\nSTEWART: No. Before she had a chance to negotiate she was murdered by one of their agents.\nDOCTOR: And you retaliated.\nREED: We had no choice.\nMEL: Just like that? Did no one speak out against it?\nSTEWART: My father did. He was executed for saying that Puxatornee would have been a nicer place to live if we’d given the Slithergees what they wanted.\nDOCTOR: But you won in the end, I take it?\nREED: At great cost. The Slithergees left our planet a poisonous wasteland. Nothing can survive out there.\nMEL: But how can you live if there’s no\nSTEWART: We can't. Those of us who are left breathing won't be for much longer. Which is why Professor Capra’s machine is the only solution.\nDOCTOR: The one we, the one we already know about.\nREED: Yes. Using the Professor’s time machine we will travel back and\nMEL: Ah, hold your horses there. Did you say time machine?\nREED: Yes. We will travel back to the point where the Slithergees first arrived and prevent the war from happening.\nMEL: Oh, I see. By destroying them before they have a chance to attack.\nSTEWART: No. By making peace with them.\nMITCHELL: Officer Potter, you were on duty the night that President Bailey was killed.\nPOTTER: That’s correct, President Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: Cast your thoughts back to that night. Christmas Eve 3060.\nPOTTER: I remember, I remember you leaving Central Bureau just before midnight.\nMITCHELL: I’d been working late with President Bailey. We were, she was considering her response to the Slithergees. What happened then, Potter?\nPOTTER: There was a security alert. We received a warning that the President would be assassinated, but when we got to her office, she was already dead.\nMITCHELL: And her secretary.\nPOTTER: Clarence? He’d shot her, then\nMITCHELL: Then turned the gun on himself. How were they when you discovered them?\nPOTTER: We've been through this a thousand times, President.\nMITCHELL: How were they?\nPOTTER: They were disrobed, as though they had been engaged in an activity of a sexual nature.\nMITCHELL: Bailey would never. She wouldn't do that. She. (door slides open) Had you ever had any suspicion that Clarence was a Slithergee agent?\nPOTTER: No.\nMITCHELL: Could he have any other reason to kill her?\nPOTTER: No, no. But he was a Slithergee agent. The evidence\nMITCHELL: Of course. We later produced evidence linking him to the enemy. If Bailey hadn’t died, she would have secured a peaceful settlement, I’m sure of it. A future was denied to us that night. Puxatornee lost its finest leader, and I lost, I lost\nPOTTER: Ahem. President, I am due back on patrol.\nMITCHELL: Of course. But first, check on the Doctor and Mel. I want to know more about them.\nPOTTER: Salute.\nMITCHELL: Yes. Salute.\nMEL: So let me get this straight. You’re going to go back in time to kill the President’s secretary, Clarence, before he can kill the President, so the President, who won't be dead, can then forge a peace treaty?\nSTEWART: But you knew all this already.\nDOCTOR: Of course. But you tell it so well.\nSTEWART: Now, Doctor, it’s your turn to answer our questions.\nREED: Stewart, we’re due on patrol. We'll have to conclude the interrogation later.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and I was just beginning to enjoy it.\nSTEWART: Don't worry, we'll be back sooner than you think.\nMEL: So, Doctor, what now?\nDOCTOR: We're locked in. It seems we have no choice but to sit and contemplate our fate.\nMEL: Do you think they can do it? Travel through time.\nDOCTOR: Given sufficient resources and desperation, I don’t see why not. It’s not against the laws of physics. But I can’t permit it. Changing history isn’t like changing a light bulb.\nMEL: Why? What could happen?\nDOCTOR: Well, you might burn your hand or get electrocuted or fall off a step-ladder.\nMEL: No, not changing a light bulb, Doctor. Changing history.\nDOCTOR: Oh, changing history. Well, all sorts of confusing things can happen. For example, if\nSTEWART: 2: Doctor! Mel! We've found you.\nMEL: Back so soon? Did you forget something?\nREED: 2: What are you talking about.\nMEL: Well, you only left a moment ago.\nDOCTOR: No, Mel. This isn’t the Stewart and Reed who just left. This appears to be another Stewart and Reed. How odd.\nREED: 2: Mel, it’s us. You can’t have forgotten.\nMEL: Well, look, whoever you are, what do you want with us?\nSTEWART: 2: We’ve come to rescue you. Again. We just pretended to be the Lieutenants to get into the building.\nREED: The guards agreed to hand you over.\nDOCTOR: How kind.\nSTEWART: 2: We still need your help, Doctor. Once we get back to the Tardis, you’re going to\nMEL: What? You know about the Tardis?\nREED: 2: There’s no time to talk. We've got to get out of here before they become suspicious.\nMITCHELL: Mitchell.\nPOTTER: [OC]: President Mitchell. The Doctor and Mel, they’ve just been handed over to Lieutenants Stewart and Reed. They're leaving the Bureau.\nMITCHELL: What! I gave no such instruction. (changes channel) Lieutenant Stewart, what do you think you’re doing?\nSTEWART: [OC]: We’re just starting patrol.\nMITCHELL: You're not in Central Bureau?\nSTEWART: [OC]: No, we’re on zone omega beta.\nMITCHELL: Get back here at once.\nSTEWART: [OC]: Salute.\nMITCHELL: Officer Potter, whoever it is who is with the Doctor and Mel, it isn’t Stewart and Reed. They must not be allowed to escape. You are authorised to use any force necessary.\nPOTTER: [OC]: Understood. Salute. (weapons fire, sirens) It’s too late. One of our guards managed to shoot the imposters, but the other two got away. They were last seen heading for lambda rho.\nMITCHELL: Then get after them!\nMEL: That was close. They didn’t expect us to double back. Oh Doctor, those poor people who rescued us.\nDOCTOR: They were vaporised. A very efficient form of killing, if not particularly friendly towards the ozone layer.\nMEL: But who were they? Stewart and Reed’s long-lost identical twins?\nDOCTOR: Later, Mel. Much later. While the guards are out searching the city, I want to see this time machine of theirs.\nMEL: You want to sabotage it, you mean.\nDOCTOR: The Web of Time is very delicate, Mel. One wrong ingredient and the whole thing might collapse like an overheated soufflé. I can’t allow history to be altered.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Attention all sec patrols. This is your President speaking. Two Slithergee agents have escaped from captivity and must be recaptured at once. The enemy agents are the ones identified previously as the Doctor and Mel.\nMEL: Capra laboratory. Absolutely positively no admittance. Trespassers will be evaporated. Hmm, this sounds like it might be the place.\nDOCTOR: It’s unguarded. Strange.\nMEL: Presumably the security people are out looking for us.\nDOCTOR: Presumably. Come on, we'll\nMEL: Someone’s coming.\nDOCTOR: Quick, Mel, behind here.\nMEL: It’s them. It’s Stewart and Reed. But they were vaporised.\nDOCTOR: It’s the Lieutenants Stewart and Reed.\nMEL: Oh, the originals. Doctor, they’re blocking the entrance.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You know, what we really need now is some sort of diversion. If only I\nREED: Do you think the President was right? The Doctor and Mel will try to break into the Professor’s lab.\nSTEWART: Well, even if they’re not working for the Slithergees they're up to something, so\nREED: So maybe they are here to sabotage the experiment. After all, it is at a critical stage.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Lieutenant Stewart?\nSTEWART: Salute.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: A sec patrol has picked up Mel and the Doctor in zone lambda rho. I want you and Lieutenant Reed to bring them in.\nSTEWART: Understood, President Mitchell. Salute.\nREED: Lambda rho? That’s on the other side of the city.\nSTEWART: Then again, it could all just be one big coincidence. Let’s go.\nDOCTOR: They’re moving away, Mel. This is our chance. Follow me.\nCAPRA: J God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay. Remember Bailey our glorious President was killed upon this day.\nMEL: Computers and flashing lights. Yes, this must be it.\nDOCTOR: And if I’m not mistaken, the box of tricks with the tinsel on it is a time machine.\nCAPRA: And who might you be?\nDOCTOR: Didn’t you hear the warning about the enemy agents?\nCAPRA: Why?\nMEL: We’re them.\nCAPRA: Get out of my laboratory this nanosecond.\nDOCTOR: And being enemy agents, we’re the sort of people you would expect to be armed and highly dangerous.\nCAPRA: What?\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Professor Capra?\nMEL: So you’d better do as we say, buster.\nCAPRA: Speaking.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: The enemy agents will be attempting to enter your laboratory. Stewart and Reed are on their way. Until they arrive, keep your door locked. Don’t open it for anyone.\nDOCTOR: Well? Answer.\nCAPRA: Understood. Don’t let the Doctor and Mel in.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Remember, Capra, the future of Puxatornee depends on you.\nDOCTOR: Right. Now, back against that wall, or I will be forced to show you exactly how armed and dangerous we are.\nMITCHELL: You allowed Mel and the Doctor to escape, Officer Potter. You will be executed for treason.\nPOTTER: No, please, listen.\nMITCHELL: You still claim you handed them over to Stewart and Reed?\nPOTTER: I’m not claiming anything. It was them. I’ve worked under the Lieutenants for the lasts five years.\nMITCHELL: But there’s no way they could have got from the laboratory to lambda rho that quickly!\nPOTTER: Yes, but you only have their word for it, that they'd been guarding the lab in the first place, haven’t you.\nMITCHELL: You mean that when I called them, they were already on their way? That they had arranged to meet the spies? That they are collaborating with them?\nPOTTER: I’m not saying anything. But when I offered to help escort the prisoners, they refused. I thought it was odd\nMITCHELL: But, yes, it makes sense. Stewart and Reed are in league with the Doctor and Mel, and I ordered them to go back to the Professor’s laboratory. The experiment! Hand me your gun.\nPOTTER: You will not be needing my assistance?\nMITCHELL: No. I no longer need tolerate your ineptitude.\nMITCHELL: And a sombre retribution day to you. Salute.\nCAPRA: Why won't you leave my time machine alone? Oh dear.\nMEL: Whatever it is you’re doing, Doctor, you’d better hurry up before Stewart and Reed come back.\nDOCTOR: Look, Mel. Leptonite crystals. Ah ha!\nSTEWART: Step away from the machine, Doctor.\nMEL: Oh, I really must stop speaking too soon.\nDOCTOR: Odd. There doesn’t seem to be an off switch. What an oversight.\nREED: Lieutenant Stewart said move away from the machine, Doctor.\nSTEWART: Or I'll kill Mel.\nDOCTOR: You’re making a grave mistake.\nCAPRA: You’re the one who’s making a grave mistake, Doctor. Kill them, Lieutenants. Vaporise them now.\nREED: No. No. Not until we know why they want to stop the experiment.\nDOCTOR: Because it’s my duty to protect Time. It’s line one of the Time Lord job description. You can’t, mustn't, meddle with history.\nCAPRA: Oh, the machine is still functioning perfectly. Good, good. Lieutenants, if you will kindly take your places on the podium there, I will\nMITCHELL: Wait! Stop the experiment!\nCAPRA: I’m afraid it’s too late, President.\nMITCHELL: You must not send the Lieutenants back in time..\nDOCTOR: Thank goodness someone has seen sense.\nMITCHELL: They are enemy agents working with the Doctor and Mel on behalf of the Slithergees.\nDOCTOR: On second thoughts.\nSTEWART: What are you on about?\nMITCHELL: Get off the platform, both of you. You knew, didn’t you. The Slithergees must have told you\nCAPRA: I can’t delay the temporal remission. Oh dear. (counts down quietly in the background)\nREED: Told us? Told us what?\nMITCHELL: President Bailey’s secretary wasn’t a Slithergee agent.\nSTEWART: What?\nMEL: Doctor, what are they talking about?\nDOCTOR: Shh. It'll probably all make sense later.\nMITCHELL: We don’t know why Clarence killed her, but he wasn’t acting for the Slithergees. Now, get off the podium, Lieutenants. I’m taking your place.\nSTEWART: No. No! You mean the war was all a mistake? All because of you?\nMITCHELL: You don’t understand. I loved her! She betrayed me. I had to do something. I wasn’t thinking. I was wrong!\nSTEWART: I’m going to kill you, President, for your crimes against Puxatornee.\nREED: Stewart, it doesn’t matter what he did. Think. If we go back in time and save Bailey's life, we can still prevent the war.\nMEL: No, listen to the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mel, keep back. That time field is highly unstable.\nCAPRA: Two.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Mel, watch out! Mel!\nCAPRA: One.\nCAPRA: It worked.\nREED: They’ve vanished. Lieutenant Stewart and Mel.\nDOCTOR: There’s no time to lose. Reed, follow me.\nREED: What?\nDOCTOR: Do you want to see your friend again or not? No, no, wait.\nREED: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The leptonite crystals. Mustn’t forget them. Here, look after them for me. Now, come on, to the snow buggy.\nREED: Doctor, what happened back there?\nDOCTOR: The time field was misaligned, so the Professor’s machine sent Mel back through Time instead of you.\nREED: So, so she’s now in the past with Stewart.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But unfortunately, they were on a one-way ticket.\nREED: What?\nDOCTOR: The time machine was designed only to be used once, which means we can’t use it to go after them and we can’t use it to bring them back, so\nREED: So?\nDOCTOR: So we'll have to follow them in this, my time machine.\nREED: Doesn't look much like a time machine to me.\nDOCTOR: Appearances are deceptive. Get in.\nREED: I don’t believe it. It’s bigger on the inside.\nMITCHELL: What do you mean, there’s nothing you can do?\nCAPRA: The machine, it’s no good. Every circuit has overloaded. I was never any good at wires.\nMITCHELL: Then we can only that Lieutenant Stewart succeeds and saves President Bailey, so she never died, so that none of this ever happened.\nCAPRA: Indeed. So that we are not now standing here about to die in a massive explosion.\nMITCHELL: Yes. What?\nCAPRA: I never did resolve the power supply difficulties. The machine can’t be turned off.\nMITCHELL: You mean it’s going to destroy the laboratory?\nCAPRA: Think bigger.\nMITCHELL: The whole building?\nCAPRA: Bigger than that.\nMITCHELL: The city?\nCAPRA: You're getting warmer. In fact, we both are.\nMITCHELL: How long do we left\nDOCTOR: The Central Bureau building, Christmas Eve, the year 3060, just after eleven p.m.\nREED: We’ve arrived at the same time as the others?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. They’ve a head-start. We have to reach them before, before Stewart murders the President’s secretary.\nREED: But he has to do it. If it saves our planet, it’s worth\nDOCTOR: If? If? You can’t predict the consequences. You might alter events for the worse.\nREED: How could things be worse?\nDOCTOR: Reed, I brought you here because I need your help. Now, this is your chance to save your world. To save it from Stewart’s interference. I want you to tell me everything you know about the night the President died.\nREED: There was some sort of security alert just before she was killed. We planned to use it as a diversion so that the coast would be clear when we\nMITCHELL: The Slithergee delegates are humbly demanding an answer. Will you allow them to occupy the first moon?\nBAILEY: Oh, what do you think, Deputy Mitchell?\nMITCHELL: If you refuse, President Bailey, then it could mean war. If you don’t, then you risk them gaining a foothold. Either way, the consequences could be disastrous for Puxatornee.\nBAILEY: I know. (yawns) Oh, I’m sorry. You go to bed. I'll have the answer in the morning.\nMITCHELL: Shall I wait up?\nBAILEY: No. I'll be here a few hours at least.\nMITCHELL: Aren’t you forgetting something, President?\nBAILEY: Oh, happy Christmas, darling. (kiss) I'll try not to wake you. I love you.\nMITCHELL: And I love you.\nBAILEY: Clarence? Yes, he’s just left. You can come in now.\nCLARENCE: My President. At your service.\nCLARENCE: Why was Deputy Mitchell here so late?\nBAILEY: Never mind him. It’s you I want. I want you to give me my Christmas present.\nDOCTOR: The President’s office must be around here somewhere. Why do corridors always look the same wherever I go? I can’t help feeling I’ve been this way before.\nREED: It must be this way, I think. Stewart must have got there by now.\nDOCTOR: No. You said there was a security alert before the President was killed.\nREED: Yes, but we don’t know\nDOCTOR: Ah. Now there hasn’t been an alert yet, has there? Which gives me an idea.\nDOCTOR: (using tannoy) Attention all units! Stop whatever it is you’re doing. This is a priority one code red emergency. There is going to be an assassination attempt on the President.\nDOCTOR: There. One security alert.\nREED: You caused the alert?\nDOCTOR: It should bring every guard running. Now, even if we don’t stop Stewart.\nREED: Talking of which. Doctor, there they are.\nBAILEY: I’ve loved you, I’ve always loved your body. Let me unwrap it.\nCLARENCE: It is my duty to serve my President in any way I can.\nSTEWART: No!\nBAILEY: No! Clarence!\nMEL: You killed him. You shot him in cold blood!\nSTEWART: President Bailey.\nBAILEY: What do you want? Who are you?\nSTEWART: I have just saved your life. You were about to be assassinated.\nBAILEY: Assassinated? By who?\nSTEWART: Your secretary. He was going to kill you.\nBAILEY: Clarence? No, but that doesn’t any sense.\nDOCTOR: Stop!\nREED: It’s too late, Doctor. Stewart’s already killed him. He saved the President’s life.\nDOCTOR: No. Hand me the gun, Reed. There is still one way I can make sure history remains on track. I shoot the President myself.\nBAILEY: What? No, please, I beg you.\nSTEWART: If you pull that trigger, I'll kill you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can’t allow the past to be altered.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I can’t. I can’t do it. I won’t do it.\nSTEWART: Then history will have to change.\nSTEWART: [Part Two — White Disc]\nDOCTOR: You haven't the foggiest idea what you’ve done, have you?\nSTEWART: Oh no, Doctor, I do. I’ve just saved the world.\nBAILEY: What do you mean?\nREED: President Bailey, we’re from a future where you were assassinated, where war was declared on the Silthergees.\nSTEWART: You musin’t let that happen. You must make peace with them, whatever the cost.\nBAILEY: But, my secretary, Clarence.\nSTEWART: Don’t worry, you shot him in self-defence.\nBAILEY: But why was he going to kill me? We were a\nSTEWART: Listen to me. Give the Slithergees what they want. The alternative is to deny us a future. Do you understand?\nBAILEY: I understand.\nMEL: Sorry to interrupt, but there is the small matter of the security alert. In a few minutes this place will be swarming with guards.\nSTEWART: We know what we have to do. We vaporise ourselves to remove any evidence.\nREED: No, Stewart, wait. The Doctor has a time machine. We can return to the future.\nDOCTOR: Well, Lieutenant? Or would you prefer to stay here and let off steam?\nMEL: But Doctor, you can’t want to help them after what he did?\nDOCTOR: There’s no time to discuss it now. We must return to the Tardis. When I say run, run. Come on!\nPOTTER: [OC]: Deputy Mitchell, this is Officer Potter. We’ve located President Bailey in her office. There was some sort of assassination attempt.\nMITCHELL: What?\nPOTTER: [OC]: Don’t worry, she’s unharmed. She managed to kill her secretary before he could shoot her.\nMITCHELL: Clarence? What was he doing there? Officer Potter, get me the President.\nBAILEY: [OC]: Deputy Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: Thank the saints. When I heard the security alert, I thought, what if I had lost you?\nBAILEY: [OC]: Inform the Slithergees that we will accede to their demands. They can occupy the first moon. Now leave me alone.\nMITCHELL: But I\nBAILEY: [OC]: Whatever you have to say, I’m not interested.\nMEL: Doctor.\nMEL: You didn’t say run.\nDOCTOR: What?\nMEL: You said, when I say run, run, but then you said come on. I mean, I am loathe to quibble but\nDOCTOR: Hold on.\nSTEWART: We did it, Reed. We did it.\nDOCTOR: You certainly did.\nMEL: So now we’re going to a different future, where President Bailey wasn't killed?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. History has been diverted onto a new path.\nMEL: And the old history, where she did die?\nDOCTOR: The only evidence that it ever existed is here with us in this room, isn’t it, Lieutenant Stewart.\nSTEWART: You’ve seen what the war did to Puxatornee, Doctor. I had to do it.\nMEL: You murdered Bailey’s secretary.\nREED: He was going to kill her, Mel.\nDOCTOR: Was he?\nSTEWART: It’s a matter of historical record. And what does one person matter compared to a whole world? The ends justify the means.\nDOCTOR: Lieutenant, there have been many unspeakable evils committed in the name of the ends justifying the means.\nMEL: We’ve landed.\nDOCTOR: Christmas Day in the year 3090.\nREED: We've arrived at the same time as we left?\nDOCTOR: Give or take an hour or so. And a couple of miles. Time travel isn’t an exact science. It’s more a vague one.\nMEL: Particularly when the Doctor’s at the controls.\nDOCTOR: Oi.\nSTEWART: I know where we are. This is zone lambda rho, on the other side of the city. But it was never like this.\nDOCTOR: No background radiation, and it’s still snowing. A veritable winter wonderland.\nMEL: Hmm. But I don’t think giant concrete honeycombs were quite what Doris Day had in mind.\nDOCTOR: There you go, Lieutenants. Your future awaits.\nSTEWART: I never thought I'd live to see this day.\nREED: Oh, just imagine it. Anew Puxatornee, free from fear. A new life.\nMEL: Well, I’m glad that’s all done and dusted. Now, what about those leptonite crystals?\nDOCTOR: I managed to retrieve some from the Professor’s machine, Mel.\nMEL: Marvellous! So let’s get back to the space yacht Pinto and deal with those Quarks.\nDOCTOR: Or we could take a quick look around, Mel. I mean, it is a fascinating opportunity to see the\nDOCTOR: difference that one person can make. No, you're right. We should leave. Now where did I put the crystals?\nMEL: Oh, you haven’t lost them.\nDOCTOR: No. I gave them to Lieutenant Reed for safe keeping. Ah. Problem.\nSLITHERGEE: 2 [OC]: This is Slithergee patrol 14. I have followed the dissidents’ trail to the derelict toy shop in ghetto epsilon alpha.\nMITCHELL: Make sure no one gets out alive. (ends comms) Sorry for that, Community Leader. How may I help you?\nSLITHERGEE: I have a most humble and mild request. We Slithergees have noticed that the human Representative Committee is unrepresentative.\nMITCHELL: In what way?\nSLITHERGEE: There are no Slithergees on it.\nMITCHELL: But that’s because it’s to represent humans. There are no humans on your committee, after all.\nSLITHERGEE: That is because a human cannot comprehend the Slithergee ethnic experience. We are being discriminated against. Please see that our quota is met.\nMITCHELL: What you’re asking is ridiculous.\nSLITHERGEE: I had hoped you would be more sympathetic than your late predecessor, President Mitchell. We are poor, lowly Slithergee.\nMITCHELL: I’m willing to negotiate, but\nSLITHERGEE: You consider our requests to be ridiculous. Some would consider that a nastiness hate crime. If you will excuse me, I must confer with the Slithergee Representative Committee.\nMITCHELL: As you wish. Allow me to guide you to the door.\nMITCHELL: Bailey, why did you have to do it? Why did I have to lose you? Such a waste.\nDOCTOR: You seem worried, Mel.\nMEL: Mmm. I keep getting déja vu. Like we don’t belong here. It feels like we’re stepping out onto an alien world.\nDOCTOR: The architecture is certainly eccentric. But you’re right, something terrible has happened here.\nMEL: Slithergee District. All humans prohibited, except sight guides. Trespassers will be persecuted.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. It seems the Slithergees have settled on Puxatornee.\nMEL: I thought they only wanted one of the moons?\nDOCTOR: Presumably they shifted up the property ladder.\nMEL: You know what I think? I think there still was a war, but this time the Slithergees won.\nDOCTOR: Possibly. But no. What I think we have here is a peaceful co-existence.\nMEL: All humans prohibited?\nDOCTOR: Peaceful, but not necessarily happy, or fair.\nSTEWART: Doctor, Mel.\nMEL: Lieutenant Stewart, what is it?\nREED: We've got to get under cover. They’re coming this way. Quick, into this pipe.\nMEL: Good grief. What’s that?\nSTEWART: A Slithergee. I recognise it from our history discs.\nMEL: It’s horrible. Like a giant slug. Oh, it’s got somebody on the end of a lead. Oh my\nDOCTOR: Mel, shh. It’s moving this way.\nMEL: Do you think it saw us?\nREED: That’s not very likely, Mel.\nMEL: Why not?\nSTEWART: Slithergees are as blind as snow pugs.\nDOCTOR: So that’s why it had that person on a lead. It was using them as a pair of eyes.\nMEL: People being treated as guide dogs? But that’s horrible.\nSTEWART: Doctor, you’re going to take us on another ride in your Tardis.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid that’s not possible, Lieutenant.\nSTEWART: You'll help us, Doctor, or your friend will be condensation.\nMEL: Don’t listen to them, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand. Look, that Slithergee is between us and the Tardis. We're trapped.\nMITCHELL: What can I do for you, Community Leader?\nSLITHERGEE: [OC]: President Mitchell, my sight guide has spotted a group of four humans trespassing illegally in our district. Four humans that match the dissidents’ description.\nMITCHELL: The dissidents? You mean Stewart and Reed?\nSLITHERGEE: [OC]: And Mel and the Doctor. Yes, they’re here in lambda rho. I have picked up their scent trail.\nMITCHELL: But one of our patrols has already located them in ghetto epsilon alpha.\nSLITHERGEE: [OC]: Then they are mistaken. The dissidents are undoubtedly, definitely here.\nMITCHELL: Slithergee patrol 14, call off the attack. The dissidents have been sighted in Slithergee district lambda rho, on the other side of the city.\nSLITHERGEE: 2 [OC]: But they’re here. I can smell them.\nMITCHELL: Then you are mistaken, patrol 14. Call off your attack. I want all patrols in lambda rho now.\nSLITHERGEE: 2 [OC]: Yes, Deputy Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: President Mitchell.\nMEL: Hiding in a drain pipe from a visually impaired invertebrate. Huh. Christmases in Pease Pottage were never like this.\nDOCTOR: Patience, Mel. Until the Slithergee moves away from the Tardis, we’re stuck.\nMEL: Lieutenant Reed, what is going on on Puxatornee?\nREED: President Bailey made peace with the Slithergees.\nMEL: Isn’t that what you wanted?\nSTEWART: We saw a Statue. In tribute to our greatest leader, President Bailey. But it had been defaced, in tribute to the great appeaser. She didn’t make peace, she surrendered to them!\nREED: (sotto) There’s another one. Quiet.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Be my eyes for me. Seek where I cannot. Oh, is this lambda rho? All these districts smell the same.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master.\nSLITHERGEE: Slithergee patrol 14, what kept you so long? Waiting for you has made me late for my conference.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Abject and pitiful apologies, Community Leader. I was sure the terrorists were in ghetto epsilon alpha.\nSLITHERGEE: Can’t you scent their effluvium on the breeze? They are nearby. Very nearby.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Yes, yes, but there is something, a peculiarness. They smell different somehow. Sight guide Potter.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master?\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Check the drainage ducts. They may have used the stench to mask their pungent odours. Hold still. I'll remove your leash.\nSLITHERGEE: I must leave you to conclude your search, patrol 14. Sight guide, bring me to the Committee chamber.\nMEL: Watch it. That guide, he’s coming this way.\nPOTTER: The dissidents. So you are here. But\nREED: What is it?\nPOTTER: Stewart and Reed. I killed you. I saw you dead. They said you’d survived, but I didn’t believe it.\nSTEWART: You'd better believe it, Potter.\nMEL: You vaporised him. He didn’t deserve that.\nSTEWART: He said he’d killed us. I take offence at that sort of thing. Come on, we should move.\nDOCTOR: He’s right, Mel. We must get back to the Tardis before that Slithergee notices something amiss.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: President Mitchell, there appears to be no trace of the dissidents in district lambda rho. It’s as if they’ve vanished off the face of the planet.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: They must be there somewhere. Keep searching.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: That sound. I’ve heard it before. Sight guide! Where are you? (afraid) Don’t leave me alone in the darkness. I am a poor blind Slithergee. Sight guide!\nMEL: So you weren’t impressed, then.\nSTEWART: What do you think? We’ve seen our people reduced to slavery.\nREED: It’s like a nightmare. The Slithergees have completely taken over.\nSTEWART: At least before we had our dignity.\nMEL: Well, it just goes to show. I bet you regret changing your past now.\nSTEWART: And that’s why we want you to take us back, Doctor. Take us back to Christmas Eve.\nDOCTOR: To yesterday? Whatever for?\nREED: We want to prevent Professor Capra’s experiment from taking place.\nMEL: Wait a minute. You mean you want to go back in Time to stop Stewart and me from being sent back in Time?\nSTEWART: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: I can’t do it.\nSTEWART: You will, Doctor, or I'll kill Mel.\nMEL: Don’t you see, Lieutenant? The Doctor can’t take you back because that history doesn’t exist anymore.\nSTEWART: I haven't vaporised someone for nearly two minutes, Doctor, and my trigger finger is getting twitchy. One, two\nDOCTOR: Oh, very well. But this is the very last time. I’m getting somewhat tired of your threats.\nSTEWART: This isn’t zone delta delta.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it is. We’ve materialised in exactly the same place as we first arrived. Exactly. Down to the last inch.\nREED: But it wasn’t like this when we left.\nMEL: It’s all slums and workhouses.\nDOCTOR: Because you, Lieutenant Stewart, changed history. It’s about half past ten on the night of Christmas Eve.\nREED: But we didn’t want this.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, we can’t always have what we want, can we? And it’s far too late to change your minds now.\nMEL: You can’t have your cake and eat it.\nDOCTOR: Precisely, Mel. Like how the pudding the other person chooses off the menu always looks far more appetising than your own. You’ve swapped your future for another, Stewart, and you can’t get the old one back. Lieutenant Reed, do you still have those crystals I gave you?\nREED: These? Do you want them back?\nDOCTOR: If I could. Thank you very much.\nSTEWART: You know what I think? You’ve landed us in some other part of the city. We just have to work out where we are. Come on, Lieutenant Reed.\nDOCTOR: Wait! You’re wasting your time.\nMEL: Shouldn't we go after them, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. No, they'll be back soon enough.\nMEL: Doctor, it’s that slug creature again.\nDOCTOR: Quick, Mel, behind here.\nSLITHERGEE: 2:1 am a meek and sightless Slithergee. Guide Potter, where are we?\nPOTTER: Ghetto delta delta, humble master.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Is the curfew being observed? Are all the humans huddled amongst their own squalidity and fetidness?\nPOTTER: Yes, master. No one in sight.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Then we shall continue our patrol elsewhere. Lead on.\nMEL: That man on the lead. We saw him killed.\nDOCTOR: That happened tomorrow, Mel, on Christmas Day. As far as he’s concerned it hasn’t happened yet.\nMEL: Stewart and Reed. Over there, look. Doctor, they’re coming back.\nSTEWART: 2: Are you two trying to get caught?\nMEL: No, we were waiting for you.\nREED: 2: Don’t you know it’s curfew? If the Slithergees find you out here, you'll be executed.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, we didn’t realise. We've only recently arrived.\nSTEWART: 2: What?\nMEL: You must remember, Lieutenant, we just got here and\nSTEWART: 2: Lieutenant? Who are you calling a Lieutenant?\nREED: 2: We can't hang about here talking, Stewart. We'll have to take them with us.\nSTEWART: 2: You think we can trust them?\nMEL: Of course you can. You know us. The Doctor, Mel.\nREED: 2: What? I’ve never seen you two before in my life.\nMITCHELL: President Bailey, the Slithergee Community Leader has requested an audience at midnight.\nBAILEY: Presumably to discuss the incident in ghetto omega beta.\nMITCHELL: The terrorist attack?\nBAILEY: They will hold us responsible, Deputy Mitchell. With each atrocity we are forced to make more concessions. If I didn’t know better, I would say the Slithergees welcome these hate crimes.\nMITCHELL: But you know better.\nBAILEY: Human casualties, three hundred and twelve. Slithergee casualties, nil. Curiously, they evacuated shortly before the explosion. Are you sure there was no warning?\nMITCHELL: Do you think I'd have allowed those people to die? You’ll have to give the Community Leader what it requests. You know the alternative.\nBAILEY: Yes, you’re right as always, Mitchell. What would I do without you to advise me.\nMITCHELL: I have only ever wanted to assist, to be at your side. I’ve given you everything. I only hope that you\nBAILEY: It’s the anniversary tonight.\nMITCHELL: The assassination attempt?\nBAILEY: Thirty years ago tonight, my secretary Clarence died so that I could live. So that Puxatornee would have a future, a hope. Three hundred and twelve! Who was behind it?\nMITCHELL: Stewart and Reed. It wouldn't be the first time they’ve targeted Slithergee collaborators. After we disposed of the other members of their cell last week, they’re the only known terrorists left.\nBAILEY: I want this situation resolved, Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: I'll see to it. Anything else?\nBAILEY: No. You may go. I need to prepare the Christmas broadcast.\nCAPRA: [OC]: [unintelligible] President Bailey?\nBAILEY: Professor Capra, I’m on my way to see you about those dissidents brought in last week.\nREED: (coughing) It’s no good, Lieutenant. We’re lost.\nSTEWART: No, I recognise this area. This is zone omega beta.\nREED: I’m amazed you can tell through the smoke. Oh no. What happened?\nSTEWART: Half the street’s been destroyed.\nREED: Must be hundreds of them. Sight guide training camp. Who could do something like this?\nSTEWART: Terrorists, if they were desperate enough, if they hated the Slithergees enough.\nREED: And kill their own people? I don’t see any Slithergee corpses. Do you believe the Doctor now? This isn’t how things should be. You shot Bailey’s secretary, you made all this happen.\nSTEWART: I didn’t expect it to turn out like this. I thought Bailey would resist the Slithergees.\nREED: Resist them? She sold us out.\nSTEWART: There must be a way of getting our history back. We've got to find the Doctor and Mel, make them help us.\nMEL: Just where are you taking us?\nREED: 2: Away from ghetto delta delta. The whole zone is crawling with Slithergees. They've mounted an all- out search.\nDOCTOR: What are they looking for?\nSTEWART: 2: Us.\nMEL: You? But we’ve only been here a few minutes.\nREED: 2: What are you on about?\nMEL: You must remember. We came here, in our time machine.\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Mel. (sotto) This isn’t our Stewart and Reed.\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR: (sotto) This is another Stewart and Reed. They’re not the Lieutenants.\nMEL: But Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) I'll explain later. (normal) Tell me, why are the Slithergees searching for you?\nSTEWART: 2: You’re better off not knowing. And who are you, anyway?\nDOCTOR: You’ve better off not knowing. So, you’re the resistance, are you?\nSTEWART: 2: That’s correct. We’re fighting for\nMEL: Sorry, just the two of you?\nSTEWART: 2: The rest of our group were captured last week. Now, what was that about a time machine?\nMEL: Oh, nothing. You don’t want to listen to me.\nDOCTOR: Mel's an inveterate fibber.\nMEL: That’s right. I’m as deceitful, dishonest and about as unreliable as they come.\nSTEWART: 2: I don’t carry this gun for decoration, Doctor. I'll ask you again. What time machine?\nDOCTOR: Oh well, it’s like this.\nREED: 2: That'll have to wait, Stewart. Slithergees, heading this way.\nSTEWART: 2: We'll have to split up. It’s our only chance.\nBAILEY: The terrorists were brought in for interrogation. Then what happened, Professor?\nCAPRA: I subjected them to the mind-peeler, of course. They didn’t want to confess, but in the end no one resists the mind-peeler.\nBAILEY: What did they say?\nCAPRA: You weren't informed? They told me about Stewart and Reed and their dreadful plan to destroy the training centre.\nBAILEY: No. I wasn’t informed.\nCAPRA: Oh dear. I told Deputy Mitchell. I assumed\nBAILEY: You told him? (sigh) Return to your duties, Professor.\nBAILEY: Security?\nGUARD: [OC]: Yes?\nBAILEY: President Bailey speaking.\nGUARD: [OC]: Ma’am.\nBAILEY: I want a listening device placed in Deputy Mitchell’s office.\nMEL: We’ve lost them. And Stewart and Reed. You don’t think the Slithergees might have killed them?\nDOCTOR: No, no. I’m sure they got away.\nMEL: So where to now? Back to the Tardis?\nDOCTOR: Not yes, it’s too risky with all the patrols.\nMEL: Well, in that case, you’ve got some explaining to do. Those two people we just met, they were Stewart and Reed, and yet at the same time they weren't.\nDOCTOR: Ah. It’s perfectly simple, Mel. Our Stewart and Reed, the Lieutenants, are from the history where President Bailey was killed. The Stewart and Reed we just met are from this version of history, where Bailey wasn’t killed.\nMEL: So all the people who are in the old history are also here but in different versions.\nDOCTOR: Different because they will have lived different lives over the past thirty years, yes. Everyone has their counterpart.\nMEL: So now there are two Stewarts and two Reeds wandering around.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately yes, because we brought them from their history to this one.\nMEL: But Doctor, remember before, when we were in the cell, the Stewart and Reed who rescued us, who were vaporised, well, they were the ones from this history.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I wonder how they got there?\nMEL: Maybe they hitched a lift in a time machine.\nDOCTOR: Of course! That’s it! You remember I said that everything has a counterpart in this history? That’s everything, including us!\nMEL: What? Another me and another you? But if that’s the case, where are they? We. They. Us.\nDOCTOR: What time is it?\nMEL: Half past eleven.\nDOCTOR: And we first landed here ten minutes to midnight, which means that the other Doctor and Mel are just about to turn up in their Tardis, precisely as we did.\nMEL: You mean\nDOCTOR: They’re going to materialise in zone delta delta.\nMEL: But that’s where the Tardis is now, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Precisely the same place.\nMEL: That sounds like it might be a problem.\nDOCTOR: A problem? It’s catastrophic! We must get back to the Tardis and leave before our other selves arrive in their Tardis.\nMEL: But you said it was too risky. The Slithergees\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to live a little dangerously, won’t we?\nSTEWART: Lieutenant Reed? Well?\nREED: It’s no good. The Slithergees are everywhere. There’s no way we can get back to zone delta delta.\nSTEWART: So what do you suggest we do? Wait here until we get\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Do not move. If you move, my sight guide will shoot you. Are they moving, sight guide Potter?\nPOTTER: No, humble master.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Good. They are the terrorists.\nSTEWART: What are you talking about? We're not terrorists. You Know who we are, Potter. Your superior officers, Lieutenants Stewart and Reed.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Steward and Reed. Yes, the dissidents.\nREED: Officer Potter, you’ve served under us for five years. You must remember.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: One of our patrols spotted you consorting with two other terrorists. Who where they? What were their names?\nSTEWART: Two others? You mean Mel and the Doctor?\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Mel and the Doctor. I am mildly indebted. Nevertheless, I have been instructed to have you both executed. Sight guide, if you will?\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master.\nSTEWART: Stop. Drop that gun, Potter, or I'll vaporise you. Damn. Power pack’s exhausted.\nREED: Stewart, remember what this man said when we met him before? About how he’d killed us? He was talking about this, now. He’s ah!\nMITCHELL: And you had them killed?\nSLITHERGEE: 2 [OC]: Certainly. The terrorists Reed and Stewart are both very dead.\nMITCHELL: President Bailey will be pleased. Did you get the identity of the other two dissidents?\nSLITHERGEE: 2 [OC]: They are called Mel and the Doctor.\nMITCHELL: Last seen heading towards ghetto delta delta. Slithergee patrol 14, I want you out there at once. I want those two arrested.\nMEL: The Tardis. We’ve made it.\nDOCTOR: We’re not home and dry yet, Mel.\nMEL: So that’s it. We’re leaving Puxatornee just like that?\nDOCTOR: Well, we don’t have much choice. We have to dematerialise before our counterparts materialise their Tardis slap-bang on top of us. Besides, it’s about time we got back to the space yacht Pinto and solved the Quarks, isn’t it?\nMEL: Mmm. But what about all the changing history shenanigans? What about the Lieutenants? Who’s going to sort it all out?\nDOCTOR: We will, or rather, the other Doctor and Mel will, I expect. They’re very resourceful people, you know.\nMEL: Why don’t we just move the Tardis to another part of the city, then we could warn them, let them know\nDOCTOR: And have two of you and two of me wandering about the place at the same time? No, I think things have already got quite complicated enough What time is it, Mel?\nMEL: About ten minutes to twelve.\nDOCTOR: We’re cutting it very fine. Ooo, that’s them. Us. Here they come. Now, our exit may cause them a little temporal turbulence.\nMEL: So that’s it? We’re zooming off and leaving it for our other selves to put to rights?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I mean, after all, can you think of anyone better?\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Attention all Slithergee patrols. Two dissidents are at large and must be captured at once. They were last seen approaching ghetto delta delta. I repeat, last seen approaching\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Ghetto delta delta? That’s where we are, isn’t it? Guide, be my eyes for me and seek where I cannot.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master. Ghetto delta delta.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: I repeat, the dissidents are a human female, twenty plus, and a human male, forty plus, called Mel and the Doctor.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: So, they’ve decided to scurry amongst their own, have they? They think their trail will be lost amongst the squalor, but I sniff them out.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Hold still. What’s that?\nPOTTER: It appears to be something appearing.\nPOTTER: [Part One — Black Disc]\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Attention all Slithergee patrols. Two dissidents are at large and must be captured at once. They were last seen approaching ghetto delta delta. I repeat, last seen\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Ghetto delta delta? That’s where we are, isn’t it? Guide, be my eyes. Seek where I cannot.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master. Ghetto delta delta.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: I repeat, the dissidents are a human female, 20 plus, and a human male, 40 plus, called Mel and the Doctor.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: So, they’ve decided to scurry amongst their own, have they? They think their trail will be lost amongst the squalor, but I will sniff them out. Hold still. What’s that?\nPOTTER: It appears to be something appearing.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: I scent something strange and peculiarness. We shall investigate. Lead me to it, sight guide Potter. Lead me.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master.\nMEL: Doctor, what’s hap (silence) happening?\nDOCTOR: Just some turbulence in the Vortex, Mel.\nMEL: I thought the ship was going to shake itself to pieces, and us with it.\nDOCTOR: I grant you the landing may have been a little on the bumpy side.\nMEL: Bumpy? I’m not inclined to use rude words, Doctor, but if I was I’d use several to describe how bumpy that landing was.\nDOCTOR: We've arrived slap-bang er, on target. The Earth colony on the planet Puxatornee in the year 3090, December the 24\". Hmm,\nMEL: So what are we doing here? And why did we leave the space yacht Pinto in such a hurry?\nDOCTOR: It’s quite simple. This is the only planet in the galaxy where you can find leptonite crystals.\nMEL: Leptonite?\nDOCTOR: Quark’s are highly allergic to leptonite, Mel. It makes them go berserk and explode.\nMEL: Oh, I see. So we get the crystals, nip back to the Pinto, and quell the Quarks.\nDOCTOR: Hopefully violence won’t be necessary, but yes.\nMEL: You're sure this is the right place? It’s all slums and workhouses.\nDOCTOR: It’s very odd. The last time I visited here, it was brimming with prosperity.\nMEL: When was that?\nDOCTOR: It was the year of the Proxima Centuri All-Blacks, when they did the double. 3012.\nMEL: Seventy eight years ago? I’m not surprised things have changed a bit.\nDOCTOR: And for the worse, it seems.\nMEL: Mmm, it does look awfully grim. The sort of place that would have Lowry setting up his easel.\nDOCTOR: I wonder what caused the shift in their fortunes?\nMEL: You want to explore, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you, Mel? According to the instruments, there’s a concentration of leptonite nearby, and we can look around at the same time. We’d better wrap up, though. It’s snowing heavily out there.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Describe what is happening, sight guide Potter, for I am a poor blind Slithergee who cannot see.\nPOTTER: Two people are getting out of the blue hut, humble master. They match the description of the dissidents!\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Yes, I smell them. They have an unusual odour. The man, he is unlike any human I have scented before. Oddness.\nPOTTER: They’re heading towards us.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: We have not been seen?\nPOTTER: No, humble master.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Then prepare the stun pistol.\nDOCTOR: Listen, Mel.\nMEL: Midnight. Which means it’s\nDOCTOR: Happy Christmas, Mel.\nMEL: And to you, Doctor. Though I can’t imagine anyone having a happy Christmas here.\nBAILEY: [OC]: Greetings, citizens of Puxatornee. This is your President speaking. I would like to wish everyone a jubilant Christmas. In particular, I extend goodwill to all Slithergees.\nMEL: Slithergees?\nDOCTOR: Shh.\nBAILEY: [OC]: Since the recent unprovoked hate crime against the Slithergees in ghetto omega beta, curfew is extended to midday. Any humans found on the streets will be prosecuted. Fatally.\nMEL: Ghettos? Curfews? Sounds like they're having a simply unwonderful Christmas time.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Do not move. If you attempt to escape, you will be shot with the stun pistol. Are they moving, sight guide Potter?\nPOTTER: No. They’re standing quite still, master. They've put their hands up and everything.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: You are the dissidents known as the Doctor and Mel?\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m the Doctor, but I’m undecided on the dissident. And how do you know who we are?\nSLITHERGEE: 2: A warrant has been given for your arrest. You have consorted with known terrorists.\nMEL: Known terrorists? We don’t know any known terrorists. And even if we did, we wouldn't consort with them. At least, not knowingly.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Sight guide Potter.\nPOTTER: Yes, humble master.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Lead us back to Central Bureau. Keep the prisoners under constant watch. With both your eyes. You are authorised to use the stun pistol if they make any sudden running away type movements.\nPOTTER: Yes, master. You, move. Slowly.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Guide me. Guide me. For I am a poor, sightless Slithergee.\nMEL: So that giant slug thing would be a Slithergee, would it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’ve not encountered them before.\nMEL: They’re using people as their guide dogs. It’s horrible.\nDOCTOR: Well, they are blind, Mel.\nMEL: But even so. Goodwill to all Slithergees indeed. And you can certainly see what the pecking order is around here. How come they know who we are? Why do they think we’re dissidents?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. We haven’t been here before.\nMEL: Maybe we come here at some point in our future, and we’re seeing the consequences of things we haven't done yet.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that is a possibility. One of the hazards of time travel is that occasionally you may, you know, kind of, ah! (thud)\nPOTTER: Get up!\nMEL: Doctor, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: I seem to have tripped. Oof. As I was about to say, you may be right, Mel, but I have a worrying feeling it may turn out to be even more convoluted than that. We'd better pay close attention or we might end up completely bewildered.\nMEL: Well, whatever’s going on, they seem to think we’re up to no good. And no sooner had we stepped out of the Tardis than they were pointing guns at us.\nDOCTOR: (laughs) Yes. At least that’s normal.\nSTEWART: I’ve spotted them, Reed. They’ve been picked up by a Slithergee patrol.\nREED: [OC]: Stewart, did you see the machine? The one the girl Mel mentioned?\nSTEWART: This blue box, it turned up out of nowhere. She was telling the truth.\nREED: [OC]: Then they are our only hope.\nMITCHELL: President, a patrol located two of the dissidents near ghetto delta delta. They were killed attempting escape.\nBAILEY: And that’s your reason for disturbing me? The Slithergee Community Leader is due here at any moment and you think\nMITCHELL: I thought, I hoped you’d be pleased with me.\nBAILEY: It'd take more than a couple of dead conspirators for you to please me. It’s much too late.\nBAILEY: That’s the Community Leader now. You were about to leave, Deputy Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: Yes, I. Forgive me for bothering you. Good morning.\nBAILEY: And good... morning to you, Community Leader.\nSLITHERGEE: I humbly beg your attention, President Bailey. We Slithergees are being provoked. We are the constant victims of hate crimes. For example, the recent vicious attack on our Sight Guide Training Camp.\nBAILEY: I’m doing all I can. I’ve spent the last thirty years trying to build peace between humans and Slithergees.\nSLITHERGEE: And yet you refuse to punish the perpetrators.\nBAILEY: I require evidence.\nSLITHERGEE: So you think we're liars, do you?\nBAILEY: Oh, not at all. I understand\nSLITHERGEE: I understand only too well. We are an oppressed, downtrodden minority.\nBAILEY: With all due respect, you occupy over nine tenths of the planet’s surface. You hardly constitute a minority.\nSLITHERGEE: Being a minority has nothing to do with how many of us there are. It is a state of mind. Wherever we go, we find nothing but prejudice and intolerance.\nBAILEY: Nevertheless\nSLITHERGEE: Nevertheless, we humbly and meekly demand extra protection. And more sight guides. And longer curfews for humans. You know the alternative.\nBAILEY: Yes. Anything else?\nSLITHERGEE: As the undemocratically elected Slithergee representative, I must protest at your recent seasonal broadcast.\nBAILEY: But I made it clear that goodwill should be extended to all Slithergees.\nSLITHERGEE: We Slithergees do not recognise the concept of Christmas. We find it an affront to our ethnic beliefs.\nBAILEY: But, but, it's Christmas. We teach Slithergee culture in our schools. We\nSLITHERGEE: We would prefer it if were replaced by Slimetide Solstice. We have no objection to humans\nSLITHERGEE: continuing with their superstitious ceremonies so long as it’s made quite clear that they’re wrong.\nBAILEY: I don’t want to argue, but\nSLITHERGEE: You would prefer to persecute us for our beliefs? That is dangerously close to a hate crime.\nBAILEY: Please excuse me. What is it, Deputy Mitchell?\nMITCHELL: [OC]: The two remaining dissidents have also been captured, ma’am. The Doctor and Mel, they've been sent to Professor Capra for interrogation.\nCAPRA: Hello. I’m Professor Capra, and I'll be conducting your interrogation. And you are?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and this is Mel.\nCAPRA: Well, that’s us off to a good start. You wouldn't believe the things I have to do to some people just to get their names. Delighted to have you here. Would you care to pull a cracker?\nMEL: What?\nCAPRA: It is Christmas. In my line of work one so rarely gets the chance to be festive. Pity I haven’t got any music.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I noticed the tinsel on your, now what is that box of tricks?\nCAPRA: Oh, that’s the mind-peeler. I spent the last fifteen years developing it. Do you like it? It has ten settings.\nMEL: And you’re going to start on one and go up to ten?\nDOCTOR: With ten being the most agonising setting of all?\nCAPRA: Last time I had it on ten, the poor chap’s ears melted, and half the city suffered a power cut. Still, he was an awful traitor. I think. Never did confess. Couldn’t hear the questions, you see. You seem remarkably au fait with the whole process, I must say.\nMEL: We’ve been interrogated before, by experts.\nCAPRA: Oh, if you know the form, that will make things so much easier. None of that dreadful fibbing business. JJ Deck the bells with boughs of doo-dah.\nCAPRA: Now then. Are you dangerous subversives?\nDOCTOR: (in pain) No.\nMEL: (in pain) No.\nCAPRA: Oh dear. That isn’t the answer I wanted. I’m afraid this is going to get very painful for you if you don’t tell the truth.\nMEL: But we are telling the truth.\nCAPRA: Well, that’s rather for me to decide, isn’t it? Two. My goodness, you're actually resisting. Ah ha, this will be Christmas fun. Three. J Good King Wenceslas looked out on a Slimetide Solstice. Dum dum. Lots of bodies lie around, some pieces fall J\nSLITHERGEE: Deputy Mitchell, may I mildly crave some of your time?\nMITCHELL: How did your meeting with the President go?\nSLITHERGEE: She is no longer agreeable to us.\nMITCHELL: Give her time. She’ll come round.\nSLITHERGEE: You can persuade her to change her mind?\nMITCHELL: I’ve always managed before, haven't I? President Bailey is tired, she’s weak. Most of all, she’s sentimental.\nSLITHERGEE: Nevertheless, we feel it is time for a new President of Puxatornee.\nMITCHELL: You don’t mean. But\nSLITHERGEE: Don’t you want to replace her?\nMITCHELL: I don’t want to see her hurt. She means a lot to me, despite everything.\nSLITHERGEE: As you wish. Though I fail to understand why you want to protect her.\nSLITHERGEE: What is happening?\nMITCHELL: Two intruders have broken into Central Bureau, heading for the interrogation chamber. They’ve been identified as. But that’s impossible.\nCAPRA: JJ Ding dong merrily on high, in heaven the bells are ringing.\nDOCTOR: Believe me.\nCAPRA: I should mention that once the mind-peeler goes up to five, it’ll start doing all sorts of permanent damage to your brains.\nMEL: Oh, we only just got here. We haven't done anything.\nCAPRA: That doesn’t make sense. I shall just have to scrape away another layer of your consciousness to get at the truth. No one resists the mind-peeler.\nCAPRA: What the?\nSTEWART: Move away from the machine, Professor.\nCAPRA: Aren’t you the two... I’m not going to take orders from you. I’m not letting a couple of known terrorists ruin the best Christmas I’ve had for years.\nREED: Turn it off or we'll kill you.\nCAPRA: Then I’m afraid you'll just have to kill me, won’t you.\nSTEWART: Fine.\nSTEWART: Reed, watch the door. I'll free the Doctor and Mel.\nMEL: You know us?\nSTEWART: That’s why we’ve come to rescue you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I'd be very grateful to you. Ooo, I’m a trifle disorientated from the mind-peeler. Could you remind me of your names, Mister er\nSTEWART: I’m Stewart, this is Reed.\nREED: Guards on their way. We should move.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Er, no. No, wait.\nMEL: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Mel, in there. Crystals of pure leptonite. Ah ha!\nREED: Come on, you two. We’re gonna have to shoot our way out.\nBAILEY: They were rescued? From Central Bureau?\nMITCHELL: Yes, President.\nBAILEY: By the dissidents Stewart and Reed.\nMITCHELL: Yes.\nBAILEY: The ones you told me had been killed by a Slithergee patrol.\nMITCHELL: I was misinformed.\nBAILEY: And so was I.\nMITCHELL: I have given the order for their recapture.\nBAILEY: Not good enough, Deputy Mitchell. Much too late. I want you to hear something.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: I’ve always managed before, haven't I? President Bailey is tired. She’s weak. Most of all, she’s sentimental. (fast forward)\nSLITHERGEE: [OC]: President of Puxatornee.\nMITCHELL: I was helping you. I’m on your side. I’ve always been.\nBAILEY: You betrayed me.\nMITCHELL: You betrayed me!\nBAILEY: What?\nMITCHELL: You knew how I felt about you, but it wasn’t enough, was it? It was never enough. You never loved me. You wanted him!\nBAILEY: You’re right. I’ve never felt anything for you. There is nothing you could give me that I would ever want.\nMITCHELL: So instead you’ve treated me like a nothing. All these years, you made me hate you.\nBAILEY: I admit I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have trusted you. I shouldn’t have... So you think I’m weak, easily manipulated. (laughs) You’re right. I’ve handed our planet over to your Slithergee friends, haven't I? You arranged it all, didn’t you. You even had my secretary killed to convince me.\nMITCHELL: No! I. What are you talking about?\nBAILEY: It was all a lie, wasn’t it? Those people thirty years ago, they were acting under your orders, weren’t they? I see it clearly now. I’ve spent my life trying to forge peace, to prevent some terrible war, for nothing.\nMITCHELL: What are you doing? Put the gun down.\nBAILEY: I'm going to do something I should have done a long time ago. Get back against the wall, Mitchell!\nMITCHELL: No!\nMEL: What is this place?\nREED: This used to be my grandfather’s toy shop.\nMEL: Looks like nobody’s ever spring-cleaned for several decades. (coughs)\nDOCTOR: This would be a good time for you to explain what you’re up to.\nSTEWART: We're fighting for the freedom of Puxatornee.\nMEL: What, just the two of you?\nSTEWART: As I told you before, the rest of our group was captured.\nMEL: Oh, I’m sorry. Tell us, Stewart, what’s going on on Puxatornee? I’m afraid we’re not very up on your history. You'll have to fill us in a bit.\nREED: About thirty years ago, a spaceship arrived in orbit.\nSTEWART: It carried the Slithergees.\nREED: They met with Bailey, our President. They claimed to be refugees.\nSTEWART: Refugees who travelled in a heavily armed battle cruiser.\nREED: They said their home planet had been destroyed and they needed somewhere to live. So Bailey had a choice. She could either accede to their demands or risk starting a war.\nDOCTOR: And so she offered them a compromise?\nSTEWART: Yeah. She said they could have one of our moons. She betrayed us.\nMEL: Sounds to me like she was trying to avert a war.\nSTEWART: We could have beaten them, but instead she began a process of appeasement. She’s a traitor. She should be dead.\nSLITHERGEE: I smell fresh blood. What has happened here?\nMITCHELL: President Bailey is dead. She killed herself.\nSLITHERGEE: Then may I humbly express both our condolences and our unworthy felicitations to her successor, President Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: Thank you, Community Leader.\nMITCHELL: Excuse me.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: This is Slithergee patrol 14. I have followed the dissident’s trail to the derelict toy shop in ghetto epsilon alpha.\nMITCHELL: Make sure no one gets out alive.\nBAILEY: [OC]: Today I have forged an historic treaty with the Slithergees. They shall have the second moon. We extend the hand of friendship and give it a firm, vigorous shake. We intend to\nSTEWART: And then the Slithergees claimed to have run out of living room again so Bailey let them move to Puxatornee.\nREED: By then it was too late to fight back.\nSTEWART: Thanks to positive discrimination, the Slithergees controlled everything. The schools, the police. Soon humans were only fit to be their sight guides.\nMEL: But while all this was going on, someone must have said something, surely?\nSTEWART: My father did. He was found guilty of a hate crime.\nDOCTOR: A hate crime?\nREED: If you say anything negative about a Slithergee, that’s a hate crime.\nSTEWART: My father was executed just for saying that Puxatornee had been a nicer place to live before the Slithergees turned up.\nREED: So you see, Doctor, you have to help us.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, you see, I’m not so sure that’s possible. I mean, Mel and I really have to get back to the space yacht Pinto, you see. They’re having trouble with some Quarks and now we’ve got that leptonite\nREED: No, Doctor. We will use your time machine to travel back and\nMEL: Wait a minute. What makes you think we have a time machine?\nSTEWART: You told us, Mel.\nMEL: I did? Oh.\nREED: We'll go back to the point when the Slithergees first arrived and prevent Bailey from surrendering to them.\nDOCTOR: And how do you intend to do that?\nSTEWART: We'll kill her. She'll be put to death for her crimes against Puxatornee.\nMEL: Crimes which she will no longer be able to have committed.\nREED: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: No, no. I won't do it.\nSTEWART: What?\nDOCTOR: What you’re asking me to do is wrong. It’s my duty to protect Time, not fiddle about with it like a broken spin dryer.\nREED: You don’t understand, Doctor. You have to help us.\nSTEWART: Or I’ll kill Mel.\nMEL: Don't listen to them, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, I couldn’t help you even if I wanted to.\nSTEWART: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Take a look out of the window, Stewart. (taps on glass) While we’ve been sitting here talking, the building has been surrounded by Slithergees. We're trapped.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Sight guide Potter, what is happening? Describe the action. Describe.\nPOTTER: The patrols are taking up positions, humble master. The terrorists are as trapped as snow pugs in a water vat.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Ah yes. I can smell their terror. It tingles on my olfactory membranes. Prepare the flame throwers. I want that building toasted, and then roasted, and then razed to the ground.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Slithergee patrol 14, call off the attack. The dissidents have been sighted in Slithergee district lambda rho, on the other side of the city.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: But they’re here! I can smell them!\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Then you are mistaken, patrol 14. Call off your attack. I want all patrols in lambda rho now.\nSLITHERGEE: 2: Yes, Deputy Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: President Mitchell.\nMEL: I don’t understand it. One minute they were sparking up their flamethrowers, the next they were upping sticks and walking away.\nREED: Just be grateful. A few more seconds and we’d have had it. Here we are, ghetto delta delta.\nSTEWART: And that blue box is your time machine, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Really? Are you sure? I mean, it doesn’t look much like a time machine to me. Police box. What’s that? A box that arrests people?\nSTEWART: Don’t waste our time, Doctor. I saw it appear and you and Mel get out.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that blue box. Yes, sorry, mmm. That’s the Tardis.\nSTEWART: Open the door.\nMEL: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: All right, all right. If you’ll follow me inside, Stewart, Mel, Reed.\nREED: [OC]: It’s bigger on the inside.\nSLITHERGEE: President Mitchell, I have been in conference with the Slithergee Representative Committee.\nMITCHELL: Community Leader, I’m afraid this isn’t a good time.\nSLITHERGEE: We humbly and mildly venture to suggest that it is no longer appropriate for there to be a human President of Puxatornee. We consider this an inequality of opportunity.\nMITCHELL: But if it wasn’t for me you wouldn’t even\nSLITHERGEE: We would like to express our gratitude for your past cooperation, but now you are superfluous to requirements.\nSLITHERGEE: If you could please speak? I need to locate your position in the room, for I am a poor blind Slithergee and cannot see.\nMITCHELL: No.\nSLITHERGEE: Ah! There you are.\nSLITHERGEE: Now I shall be the President of Puxatornee, the planet of the Slithergees!\nDOCTOR: The Central Bureau building, Christmas Eve, the year 3060. About 11 o’clock pm.\nMEL: Why did you want to go back to this particular time, Stewart?\nSTEWART: Our history says that on this night there was some sort of security alert. Someone broke into the President’s quarters and killed her secretary.\nREED: We think it was an assassination attempt that went wrong.\nDOCTOR: And you’re here to make sure it goes right.\nSTEWART: Open the doors, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can’t let you do this. The Web of Time is delicate. One tug and the whole thing might unravel like a second-hand cardigan.\nSTEWART: I’m going to count to three. If you don’t open the doors\nDOCTOR: I know, I know, yes, you’ll shoot Mel and then me and then you'll probably find a way to open the doors anyway. So what’s the use in playing games.\nSTEWART: I’m grateful for your help, Doctor, but if you make any attempt to follow us I won't hesitate to kill you. Come on, Reed.\nMEL: Well, Doctor? Now we've seen the back of them, let’s get back to the space yacht Pinto and deal with the Quarks.\nDOCTOR: No, Mel. We have to go after them. Stewart and Reed must be prevented from changing history before it’s too late.\nMEL: But Doctor, we know they can’t change history, because we’ve seen the future already.\nDOCTOR: No, unfortunately there is an awkward thing called free will.\nMEL: Oh. You mean that predeterminism is merely a philosophical abstract, and that a physical reality of the universe is one in which all potential actions are permitted, including those whose effect is to cancel out their own logical cause?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Mel.\nMEL: Oh. Well, in that case, we’d better prevent them from changing history then, before it’s too late.\nMITCHELL: The Slithergee delegates are humbly demanding an answer. Will you allow them to occupy the first moon?\nBAILEY: Oh, what do you think, Deputy Mitchell?\nMITCHELL: If you refuse, President Bailey, then it could mean war. If you don’t, then you risk them gaining a foothold. Either way, the consequences could be disastrous for Puxatornee.\nBAILEY: I know. (yawns) Oh, I’m sorry. You go to bed. I'll have the answer in the morning.\nMITCHELL: Shall I wait up?\nBAILEY: No. I'll be here a few hours at least.\nMITCHELL: Aren’t you forgetting something, President?\nBAILEY: Oh, Happy Christmas, darling. (kiss) I'll try not to wake you. I love you.\nMITCHELL: And I love you.\nBAILEY: Clarence? Yes, he’s just left. You can come in now.\nCLARENCE: My President. At your service.\nCLARENCE: Why was Deputy Mitchell here so late?\nBAILEY: Never mind him, it’s you I want. I want you to give me my Christmas present.\nMEL: Where next? All these corridors look remarkably similar. Now I know how Theseus felt.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I can’t help feeling I’ve been this way before. But the President’s office must be around here somewhere\nMEL: Stewart and Reed have probably reached her by now.\nDOCTOR: No, remember what they said about there being a security alert?\nMEL: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Well, there hasn’t been one yet, has there? Which gives me an idea.\nDOCTOR: Attention all units. Stop whatever it is you’re doing. This is a priority one code red emergency. There is going to be an assassination attempt made on the President. (phone down.) There.\nMEL: You’ve caused the security alert they knew would happen.\nDOCTOR: It should bring every guard in the building running. Now, even if we don’t stop Stewart and Reed\nMEL: And talking of the devil, there they are, Doctor.\nBAILEY: I love you. I’ve always loved your body. Help me unwrap it.\nCLARENCE: It is my duty to serve my President in any way I can.\nSTEWART: No!\nBAILEY: No! Clarence!\nSTEWART: President Bailey.\nBAILEY: Who are you? What do you want?\nREED: We have come to execute you for your crimes against Puxatornee.\nBAILEY: What crimes?\nSTEWART: The crimes you have yet to commit.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Don’t!\nSTEWART: Doctor, I warned you not to follow us.\nDOCTOR: Stewart, you mustn't shoot this woman. If you do, the whole course of history will be diverted. You can’t predict the implications. You can’t change the past.\nSTEWART: You’re wrong, Doctor. I can.\nBAILEY: Oh! (thud)\nMEL: You killed her. You shot her in cold blood!\nSTEWART: Now history will have to change.\nSTEWART: [Part Two - Black Disc]\nDOCTOR: History? You don’t have the first clue what’s going to happen, do you.\nMEL: I think I know what’s going to happen.\nDOCTOR: What?\nMEL: The security alert, remember? In a few minutes this whole place will be heaving with guards.\nDOCTOR: And if they find us standing over the dead body of the President, they may jump to unfriendly, if not homicidal, conclusions. You have what you might call a point.\nSTEWART: We've got to get to your time machine, Doctor, so you can take us back to the future.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Come on.\nMEL: But Doctor, you can’t want to help them after what they've just done?\nDOCTOR: Mel, if Stewart and Reed remain here, they will cause even more disruption. The best thing we can do right now is to run back to the Tardis as quickly as possible.\nSTEWART: I'll just leave the gun with her secretary. Make it look like a personal matter.\nPOTTER: [OC]: Deputy Mitchell, this is Officer Potter. We ‘ve located President Bailey in her office. She’s been murdered!\nMITCHELL: What? No, you must be\nPOTTER: [OC]: We found her in her office with her secretary. They were both in a state of undress.\nMITCHELL: I don’t understand. She, with Clarence? What was he doing there?\nPOTTER: [OC]: Whoever set off the security alert knew what they were on about. She’s been assassinated. By the look of it, Clarence shot her, then turned the gun on himself.\nMITCHELL: But why? Unless. He must have been a Slithergee agent. That’s the only explanation. She, he. Potter, alert all missile defence stations. The Slithergees have committed an act of war. We will have retribution.\nMEL: That was close. For a moment back there I thought our goose had been well and truly cooked.\nDOCTOR: It was certainly getting a little heated. Hold on.\nREED: We're moving forward in Time.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We will shortly be returning to Puxatornee on Christmas Day in the year 3090.\nSTEWART: We'll be arriving just after we left?\nDOCTOR: Give or take an hour or so, and a couple of miles. I didn’t have time to calculate the exact coordinates, so I calculated approximate ones instead.\nMEL: But Doctor, won’t we be going to a version of history where President Bailey was killed?\nDOCTOR: Assassinated. Yes. The time lines have branched onto a new course.\nMEL: And the old history where she wasn’t assassinated?\nDOCTOR: The only evidence that that ever existed is standing here in this room, isn’t it, Stewart.\nSTEWART: You’ve seen the future that Bailey would have given us. We had no choice.\nDOCTOR: You murdered her secretary! What was he guilty of?\nSTEWART: We're talking about a whole world. Compared to that, what does one innocent life matter? The ends justify the means.\nDOCTOR: All my life I have fought against people who believed that the ends justified the means.\nSTEWART: And I have lived my whole life under the Slithergees.. Anything is better than that.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn't be so sure. But we'll soon find out.\nMEL: We’ve landed.\nDOCTOR: It’s still snowing. You’ve got a white Christmas.\nMEL: But not like the ones Bing Crosby used to know. It’s all rubble and ruins.\nSTEWART: I know where we are. The other side of the city, in lambda rho. It used to be a Slithergee district. It was never like this.\nMEL: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: The level of background radiation’s a trifle higher than I would like. It seems the snow is contaminated.\nMEL: Is it safe?\nDOCTOR: There you go, Stewart and Reed. Welcome to the future you created.\nSTEWART: Thanks for your assistance, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You gave me no alternative, if you remember.\nREED: Come on. Just imagine it. Anew Puxatornee free from the Slithergees. A new hope.\nMEL: Well, I’m glad to see the back of them. Now, isn’t it time we got back to the Pinto and gave those Quarks what for?\nDOCTOR: Well, we could take a quick look around, Mel. I mean, it would be an intriguing opportunity to see the difference that one person’s life makes. No? Well, yeah, you’re right. We should leave, yes? Now where did you put the leptonite crystals?\nMEL: You put them on the console.\nDOCTOR: But they’re not. Stewart and Reed must have taken them.\nMEL: We'll have to go after them out there. Doctor, how strong\nDOCTOR: Here, put these on. They'll protect you.\nMEL: What are they?\nDOCTOR: An invention of one of my early incarnations. Anti-radiation gloves.\nSTEWART: + REED 2: Salute.\nMITCHELL: Lieutenant Stewart, Lieutenant Reed. As you know, the two enemy agents have just escaped from Central Bureau.\nSTEWART: 2: That is correct, President Mitchell.\nMITCHELL: Escaped again, I should add. This is the second time that they've absconded in as many hours. I'd be better off handing security over to the snow pugs during their hibernation season.\nREED: 2: We've launched a full internal enquiry, sir. The first time they overrode the cypher lock.\nMITCHELL: And this time the officer on duty claims they were released into your custody. I find that inexplicable. Explain it.\nSTEWART: 2: It didn’t happen. We weren't even in Central Bureau at the time. We were in zone omega beta.\nREED: 2: The officer in question also claims that Lieutenant Stewart and myself were vaporised.\nMITCHELL: Which unfortunately is not borne out by the evidence, yes. The officer must have been mistaken. But the fact is we still have two saboteurs on the loose at a highly critical time.\nSTEWART: 2: With respect, President Mitchell, we still can’t be sure they are saboteurs. We haven't heard from the Slithergees for twenty years.\nMITCHELL: They know about the Professor’s research. They must be saboteurs. Lieutenant, I want you and Reed to stand guard his laboratory. Nothing must be allowed to disrupt his work. If you let me down again, I won't hesitate to have you vaporised. Let that concentrate your minds.\nSTEWART: + REED 2: Understood. Salute.\nMITCHELL: In the meantime, I'll put out a security alert. The Doctor and Mel must be caught.\nDOCTOR: You look worried, Mel.\nMEL: It feels like we’re walking through a graveyard. I keep getting déja vu, as though we shouldn’t be on this world.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Something terrible has happened here.\nMEL: Something worse than being invaded by giant slugs. I wonder where Stewart and Reed have disappeared to? If only we can get those crystals back.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Attention all Sec Patrols. This is your President speaking. Two Slithergee agents have escaped from captivity and must be recaptured at once.\nMEL: Two Slithergee agents?\nDOCTOR: Shh.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: The enemy agents are the ones identified previously as the Doctor and Mel.\nMEL: Doctor, what’s going on? They already know who we are. Again.\nDOCTOR: We seem to be becoming notorious.\nMEL: Except this time we’re enemy agents instead of dissidents.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now that’s an interesting distinction, isn’t it?\nMEL: But we haven’t been here before, have we? Not in this version of history.\nDOCTOR: We haven't. I think I’m beginning to understand.\nPOTTER: Hands up. If you attempt to escape you'll be vaporised. The Doctor. Mel. Good to have the pleasure of your company again.\nMEL: Again? I’ve never met you in my life.\nDOCTOR: Yes you have, Mel. In the other history, this man worked as a sight guide for the Slithergee.\nMEL: Yes, but he wouldn’t remember that, would he?\nPOTTER: Silence. You will come with me to Central Bureau. There’ll be no escape for you this time.\nPOTTER: [OC]: This is Sec Patrol 14. I’ve captured the two enemy agents in zone lambda rho. We’re heading back to Central Bureau now.\nMITCHELL: Good. You will receive an additional week’s protein ration. But don’t move. Stay precisely where you are. Lieutenant Stewart?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: Salute.\nMITCHELL: A patrol has picked up Mel and the Doctor in lambda rho. I want you and Lieutenant Reed to bring them in.\nSTEWART: 2: Understood, President Mitchell. Salute..\nMITCHELL: Sec Patrol 14, Stewart and Reed are on their way over to you now. Place the prisoners in their custody.\nPOTTER: [OC]: Understood. Salute.\nMEL: I thought we were going back to Central Bureau. Instead we’re just standing around being cold and miserable. This is supposed to be Christmas, not New Year’s Eve.\nPOTTER: Christmas was abolished in memory of President Bailey.\nDOCTOR: What?\nPOTTER: You must know. Bailey was murdered by your humble friends thirty years ago today.\nMEL: No, she wasn’t. We were there, and she was\nDOCTOR: You think she was killed by the Slithergees?\nPOTTER: She was shot by one of their agents. President Bailey became the first martyr of the war.\nDOCTOR: I see. And you won this war, I take it.\nPOTTER: We defeated the Slithergees, if that’s what you mean. They fled back into space, but they left our planet a poisoned wilderness.\nMEL: How can you live like this?\nPOTTER: We can’t, much longer. President Mitchell announced that there’ll be a breakthrough soon, but, but you must know all this already. You’re spies.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. I forgot.\nPOTTER: Lieutenant Stewart, over here.\nSTEWART: What's going on? Doctor? We heard an announcement.\nPOTTER: I have detained the enemy agents for you, sir.\nREED: What are you talking about?\nPOTTER: President Mitchell said that you were on your way.\nSTEWART: He did? You know who we are?\nPOTTER: Is this some sort of test? You’re Lieutenant Stewart and Lieutenant Reed. I’ve served under you for the last five years.\nREED: We’re your superiors?\nPOTTER: You’re the two highest ranking officers in the service.\nSTEWART: And you’ve captured the Doctor and Mel. I see.\nPOTTER: I was instructed to place them in your custody, sir.\nREED: Oh yeah. Yes, that’s why we’re here, officer. We’ve come to collect them.\nDOCTOR: Yes, please. Place us in their custody.\nPOTTER: Will you be requiring my assistance to escort the prisoners back to Central Bureau?\nSTEWART: No, er, Lieutenant Reed and myself will make our own way. Return to your duties, officer er\nPOTTER: Officer Potter, sir. Salute.\nDOCTOR: Thank you for that. You’re making a habit of prising us out of tight corners.\nREED: We still need you alive, Doctor. You’re going to take us on another trip in the Tardis.\nMEL: Oh no. No, not until you give us back the leptonite crystals that you stole.\nSTEWART: These? Okay, I’ll make you an offer. You cooperate, you get the crystals back. Refuse, they go down this drain. Now I'll count to three. Three.\nMITCHELL: What do you mean, you’ve just handed them over?\nPOTTER: [OC]: I did as ordered, President.\nMITCHELL: But there’s no way that Stewart and Reed could have got to zone lambda rho that quickly. Lieutenant Stewart, what’s your current location?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: We’re on our way to collect the Doctor and Mel.\nMITCHELL: I see. Only I’ve just been informed that they've been released into your custody.\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: But that’s impossible.\nMITCHELL: Officer Potter must have been lying. But why? He must be in league with them. It’s a diversion. Lieutenant Stewart, you and Reed must return to the Professor’s laboratory at once.\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: Understood. Salute.\nMITCHELL: Professor Capra?\nCAPRA: [OC]: Speaking.\nMITCHELL: The enemy agents will be attempting to enter your laboratory. Stewart and Reed are on their way. Until they arrive, keep your door locked. Don’t open it for anyone.\nCAPRA: [OC]: Understood. Don’t let the Doctor and Mel in.\nMITCHELL: Remember, Capra, the future of Puxatornee depends on you.\nMEL: Not too keen on this version of the future, then.\nSTEWART: We’ve seen our planet reduced to a waste ground. What do you think.\nREED: It’s like a vision of hell. Out there, nothing can survive, nothing can grow.\nSTEWART: At least with the Slithergees there was a chance.\nMEL: Well, it just goes to show. I bet you wish you’d never changed the past now.\nSTEWART: And that’s why we want you to take us back, Doctor. Take us back to yesterday.\nDOCTOR: To Christmas Eve? Why?\nREED: We want to prevent ourselves from travelling in your Tardis. We want to prevent ourselves from changing history.\nMEL: Now hang on. You’re saying you want to go back in Time to stop your earlier selves from going back in Time.\nSTEWART: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: I can’t do it.\nSTEWART: You will, Doctor, or I’ll crush these crystals.\nMEL: No, you don’t understand. That history doesn’t exist anymore. The Doctor can’t take you there because it’s gone.\nSTEWART: Doctor, you will do as I say. One, two\nDOCTOR: Oh, very well. But I’m getting a little weary of your threats. This is the very last time.\nSTEWART: This isn’t ghetto delta delta.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, it is. We’ve landed in precisely the same place as when we first arrived. Precisely, down to the last inch.\nREED: But this isn’t how it was when we left.\nDOCTOR: No, but you changed history, didn’t you. It’s about half past ten on the night of Christmas Eve, as requested.\nREED: But we don’t want this. We want Puxatornee back to how it was. How it was when we first stepped into the Tardis.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, we always wish for what might have been, don’t we? Until we find out that it’s not actually any better that what we’ve already got.\nMEL: The grass is always greener on the other side.\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Mel. Like how the other person’s newspaper always seems much more fascinating than your own. You’ve traded in your history, Stewart, and there’s no way you can get it back. It’s gone. I’ve kept my side of the bargain.\nSTEWART: Here, have your precious crystals. You know what I think? I think you’ve landed us in another part of the city. We just have to find out where we are. Come on, Reed.\nDOCTOR: Wait! There’s nothing you can do.\nMEL: I don’t think they want to listen, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, no. But they'll be back soon enough.\nPOTTER: Halt. Don’t move.\nMEL: Good grief. Not you again.\nPOTTER: Don’t you know you shouldn't be out during snowfall? This zone is off-limits. Who are you?\nMEL: Don’t you remember? You only arrested us ten minutes ago.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Mel, that was in the future, on Christmas Day. As far as he’s concerned, that hasn’t happened yet.\nMEL: (sotto) Oh, I see. So he doesn’t think that we’re Slithergee spies.\nPOTTER: What was that?\nDOCTOR: She said, you don’t think that we’re Slithergee spies, do you?\nPOTTER: What?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, and this is Mel. We’re enemy agents.\nMEL: Doctor!\nPOTTER: Well, in that case, you’d better come back to Central Bureau with me, hadn’t you. I’m sure they’d be delighted to take your full confession.\nMITCHELL: Lieutenant Stewart, Lieutenant Reed, I’ve been reading your reports on the food riot in zone epsilon alpha. I comment you on the execution of your duties.\nSTEWART: 2: We had no choice, President. Supplies are limited, so we have to make priorities.\nREED: 2: Resources must be targeted at those who are prepared to cooperate with the authorities.\nSTEWART: 2: After all, those of us who are left won’t be around much longer.\nMITCHELL: So the fewer mouths we have to feed, the better. Yes. Dissent is a luxury we can no longer afford. And you’re right, we don’t have much time. That’s why the Professor’s work is so important. You’re both ready?\nREED: 2: We're ready. But what if it fails?\nMITCHELL: It cannot fail, Lieutenant Reed. It’s the anniversary tonight, you know.\nSTEWART: 2: Thirty years ago, President Bailey was killed by Clarence, her secretary.\nMITCHELL: Murdered by the Slithergees. They ordered him to kill her. That’s the only possible reason. She loved... You’re too young to remember Bailey, aren’t you?\nREED: 2: We were born during the war.\nMITCHELL: She was a wonderful woman. A woman of great courage and strength. We were very close. Puxatornee lost its greatest leader. I lost much more. All burned away in a moment. After that, nothing the Slithergees could do could ever hurt me.\nMITCHELL: Mitchell. They said what? Where did you find them? Lieutenants, one of our patrols has just picked up two unidentified civilians in zone delta delta.\nREED: 2: That zone’s off-limits.\nMITCHELL: They’re being brought in now. I want you to question them. They’re making wild claims about being enemy agents. Find out what they’re up to, by any means appropriate.\nREED: Admit it, Stewart, we’re lost.\nSTEWART: I know where we are. This is epsilon alpha. Your grandfather’s toy shop is down this street.\nREED: But it looks completely different. What? No.\nSTEWART: Urgh. A massacre.\nREED: There must be hundreds of them. What sort of people could do something like this? Do you believe the Doctor now? This isn’t our history. This isn’t how it should be. You shot Bailey. You made all this happen!\nSTEWART: I didn’t know it would turn out like this.\nREED: See that statue? In tribute to our greatest leader, President Bailey, cruelly murdered by the vile Slithergees.\nSTEWART: She was a traitor!\nREED: But to these people she’s a heroine!\nSTEWART: There must be a way of getting our history back. We’ve got to find the Doctor and Mel, force them to help us.\nMEL: Endurance vile. Why is it, Doctor, that wherever we go in the universe, the prison cells all look exactly the same?\nDOCTOR: Now, let me see. It should only take me a couple of hours to override the cypher lock.\nMEL: We wouldn’t be here in the first place if you hadn’t told that dreadful man we were enemy agents.\nDOCTOR: I had to, Mel.\nMEL: Why? It seemed an awfully silly thing to do.\nDOCTOR: Because, Mel, when we arrived here on Christmas Day, the same dreadful man thought we were enemy agents, so\nMEL: So you were just making sure that the future would happen how we remember it. Of course.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. And besides, you remember that announcement we heard? It said we’d escaped, which means\nMEL: That we must have escaped before. This time, in other words.\nDOCTOR: So all I have to do is unlock this door, and we'll be free.\nMEL: Ah. I was rather hoping that Stewart and Reed would come and rescue us. I was rather getting used to it.\nMEL: Stewart! Reed! I knew it!\nREED: 2: My name is Lieutenant Reed.\nMEL: Lieutenant?\nSTEWART: 2: I’m Lieutenant Stewart, but you can call me sir, in a respectful tone. Who are you?\nMEL: What is this, some sort of gag? You know who we are. The Doctor and Mel? Well, I’m glad you’ve come to release us, anyway.\nREED: 2: Are you insane?\nDOCTOR: Mel, this isn’t the Stewart and Reed we know. This is another Stewart and Reed.\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR: I'll explain later. The Lieutenants here have probably come to interrogate us. Is that right?\nSTEWART: 2: That is correct.\nMEL: So I suppose that means you’re going to take us to see Professor Capra.\nREED: 2: What do you know about Professor Capra?\nMEL: Oh, loads. We know all about him and his machine.\nSTEWART: 2: Know about his machine? But nobody on Puxatornee outside of the President’s personal circle\nSTEWART: knows about the machine.\nMEL: We know that it runs on leptonite crystals, we know he’s been developing it for the last fifteen years. Oh, and about the time half the city suffered a power cut\nREED: 2: But you couldn’t possibly know\nDOCTOR: Oh yes we could, because we’re spies, you see.\nCAPRA: The machine is almost complete, President Mitchell. I just need to set the timer. It’s quite fiddly, you see.\nMITCHELL: We can’t wait any longer, Professor Capra. The experiment must proceed immediately.\nCAPRA: It will, in a couple of hours. Early Christ (ahem) tomorrow morning. It will be an historic achievement, in more ways than one.\nMITCHELL: And you’ve resolved the power supply difficulties?\nCAPRA: I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that, actually, because a little problem\nMITCHELL: Yes, Lieutenant?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: We’ve just finished questioning those two civilians who were brought in.\nMITCHELL: And? Are they enemy agents?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: We’re not entirely sure. They certainly seem to know a great deal about the Professor’s research.\nMITCHELL: What?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: But er, well, if they were spies, they would hardly tell us they were spies, would they?\nMITCHELL: No. They must be Slithergee saboteurs. That is the only explanation.\nMEL: Doctor, you owe me an explanation. Those two people who came in just now, they were Stewart and Reed, and yet at the same time they weren't.\nDOCTOR: Ah. It’s quite simple. Now, our Stewart and Reed are from the history where President Bailey wasn’t killed, whereas Lieutenant Stewart and Lieutenant Reed are from this history, this version of history, where Bailey was killed.\nMEL: So everyone who was in the old history also exists here, but in another version.\nDOCTOR: Different because they will have been subject to different influences over the past thirty years, yes.\nMEL: Like the man who captured us. He was a Slithergee guide dog.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Everyone has their counterpart.\nMEL: Ah. So now there are two Stewarts and two Reeds wandering around.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately yes, because we brought them from their history to this one.\nMEL: Doctor, I’ve just had a thought. You know you said that everyone has a counterpart?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMEL: Well, what about us? Why isn’t there another Doctor and Mel here?\nDOCTOR: That’s because. Oh dear.\nMEL: What is it? You’re wearing your suddenly things are much worse than I had previously expected expression.\nDOCTOR: You’re right, Mel. Where have the other me and the other you got to? What time is it?\nMEL: Half past eleven.\nDOCTOR: And we first arrived here at about ten minutes to midnight, which means that the other Doctor and Mel are about to turn up in their Tardis exactly as we did.\nMEL: You mean?\nDOCTOR: They're going to land in ghetto delta delta.\nMEL: Isn’t that where the Tardis is parked now?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Precisely the same place.\nMEL: That sounds like it might be a bad thing.\nDOCTOR: Bad? It will be disastrous. We have to get back to the Tardis before our other selves arrive in their Tardis.\nMEL: But you said it would take two hours to open the door.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nMEL: And we've got less than twenty minutes.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMEL: You’d better get a move on, then.\nMITCHELL: Mitchell.\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: President Mitchell, the Doctor and Mel, they've escaped.\nMITCHELL: What!\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: They overrode the cypher lock on their cell door. When Reed and I went to check\nMITCHELL: I’m not interested in how! Security is your responsibility. Where are they now?\nSTEWART: 2 [OC]: One of our patrols spotted them heading towards zone delta delta.\nMITCHELL: I want you and Lieutenant Reed to get out there immediately. Find them!\nMEL: The Tardis! I thought we’d never make it.\nDOCTOR: We'’re not out of the woods yet, Mel.\nMEL: So that’s it? We’re going to leave Puxatornee?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We've got the leptonite crystals, haven’t we?\nMEL: Yes, got them here, safe and sound.\nDOCTOR: So I think it’s about time we got back to the space yacht Pinto and saw to those Quarks, isn’t it?\nMEL: But what about Stewart and Reed, and Stewart and Reed? What about all that changing history palaver? Who’s going to sort all that out?\nDOCTOR: We will. Or rather, our other selves will. I hope. They’re very capable people, you know.\nMEL: Hmm. But how will we, how will they know what to do? Why don’t we just move the Tardis to another part of the city, then we could warn them. Us. Them.\nDOCTOR: And have the two of you and two of me wandering about the place at the same time? No, it’s too dangerous, too risky, and far too confusing. What time is it, Mel?\nMEL: Almost ten minutes to twelve.\nDOCTOR: Which means we have about thirty seconds to dematerialise before our counterparts materialise their Tardis on top of us. We’re cutting it very close.\nDOCTOR: That’s them. They’re on their way now. Our exit may cause them a little temporal turbulence.\nMEL: So that’s it? We’re zooming off and leaving it all for another Doctor and Mel to sort out?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Wish them luck.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: Attention all Sec Patrols. Two enemy agents are at large in the city and must be recaptured at once. They were last seen approaching zone delta delta. I repeat\nSTEWART: 2: No sign of them anywhere.\nREED: 2: This is it, though. Zone delta delta.\nMITCHELL: [OC]: The enemy agents are a human male, four oh plus, and a human female, two oh plus, called the Doctor and Mel.\nSTEWART: 2: It’s no good. We could search these ruins for days and not find them.\nREED: 2: Hang on. What's that?\nSTEWART: 2: Some sort of blue box appearing out of thin air."
