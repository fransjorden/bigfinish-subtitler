Oh yes. You were about to make me an offer, weren’t you?\nTALBAR: (LAUGHS) No, but seriously. We’re talking ten megaweight of Galdrium here!\nTALBAR: Alright, yes, it is scrap metal, but you’re still not going to get a better price this side of Cawdor.\nTALBAR: Where did I find it? You think I’m going to tell you that, so you can go there and pick it up yourself?\nTALBAR: Well, if you’re not interested, there’s plenty of others out there who are.

So, how much did we get?\nTALBAR: Eight-fifty.\nHORVAL: Eight-fifty? Is that all?

We got away without a scratch.\nHORVAL: Only because you bribed the Customs Inspector with those everlasting-life pills. I don’t think Mister Grewchaw is going to fall for that one again. He’s going to have our brachials for braces.\nTALBAR: No, he won’t. That scrap was still forty per cent Galdrium, he’s got it at a good price and he knows it.\nTALBAR: You alright, old chap?

How come you know who we are?\nDOCTOR: I was looking for you. You took quite a bit of finding.\nTALBAR: Yes, well, we don’t tend to advertise our presence, it’s better to stay incognito in our line of business. You haven’t answered my question. How do you know who we are?\nDOCTOR: You were... recommended to me.\nTALBAR: Recommended? Recommended for what?\nDOCTOR: To save my life.\nTALBAR: Think nothing of it. You have the medibot to thank for the surgeo-graft.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nTALBAR: Although, of course, if it wasn’t for us you wouldn’t have been seen by a medibot, so feel free to make any spontaneous financial demonstrations of gratitude that you feel appropriate.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I’m afraid I don’t carry any currency —\nTALBAR: What? Horval, get ready to eject him over the next refuse\nTALBAR: pipe.\nDOCTOR: - but I can assure you I am worth a great deal of money!\nTALBAR: Horval, hold off a nano. (BEAT) You are?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 12\nDOCTOR: To certain individuals. You might say I have a price on my head.\nTALBAR: Who are these individuals and what are their contact numbers?\nDOCTOR: There is one individual in particular. I wonder if you might help me look for her.\nHORVAL: Her?\nTALBAR: Who is she? What’s her name?\nDOCTOR: Her name is —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE BAR IS EMPTIED, MUFFLED TRAFFIC/RAIN OUTSIDE.\nSTARBAFF: IS SWEEPING UP)\nVIENNA: Vienna Salvatori.\nSTARBAFF: Sorry, lady-madam. Never heard of you.\nVIENNA: And do you know why that is?\nSTARBAFF: No, why?\nVIENNA: Because I’m a professional killer and nobody who hears my name ever lives to tell the tale.\nSTARBAFF: What? But I hope you are willing to make generous exception in my case?\nVIENNA: That depends. On how helpful you are.\nSTARBAFF: I am very helpful. People always say, “Starbaff, he very helpful guy. You looking for helpful guy, go to Starbaff, no-one else in town more helpful.”\nVIENNA: So let’s put it to the test. One of your customers told me you had an “arrival” here earlier this evening.\nSTARBAFF: Yes, there was unauthorise materialisation, most vexatious. Blue box turn up in middle of my bar making noise like angry Heftiphant.\nVIENNA: Where is this box now?\nSTARBAFF: I have it moved out back, it was blocking way to ladies’ lavatory.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 14\nVIENNA: And did anyone emerge from this box?\nSTARBAFF: Yes, little fellow, in bad way, staggering about.\nVIENNA: Where is this man now?\nSTARBAFF: He was taken away by Talbar and Horval, two snailers, they come in every now and then.\nVIENNA: And where might I find them?\nSTARBAFF: I think they staying in the Spotel Alendra, on outer fifth street.\nVIENNA: Thank you. You were right. You’ve been very helpful.\nSTARBAFF: So now you leave me, go bye-bye?\nVIENNA: Ah, I would, but the problem is, I’ve told you my name.\nSTARBAFF: Ah, but I no good with names. Who are you? I have no idea. Anyone ask me, we never met before in my life.\nVIENNA: Nice try. But not good enough.\nSTARBAFF: No... this is respectable...\nSTARBAFF: -.. establishment... (DIES)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 15\nTALBAR: In here, Doctor.\nTALBAR: (FX: DOOR OPENED WITH KEY CARD. THEY ENTER, MUZAK FADES,\nDOOR: CLOSES. WHIRRING FAN AIR CONDITIONING)\nDOCTOR: Not exactly five stars, is it?\nTALBAR: What did you expect, the Palladium Rosa? It’s cheap and convenient for the space port.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s obviously very popular. Mainly with insects of the order Blatteria.\nHORVAL: I wouldn’t worry, they won’t bite unless you annoy them.\nDOCTOR: That’s very reassuring.\nTALBAR: You’1l have to sleep in the chair, I’m afraid. I have to have the bed because of my bad back.\nHORVAL: What about me?\nTALBAR: You can have the bath, few blankets, you’1l be as snug as a snortis on Vortis. (BEAT) Now, how does this covey- machine work?\nDOCTOR: What is it that you two do, if you don’t mind me asking?\nTALBAR: Bit of everything. You name it. Freight, asteroid mining. For the last ten annum we’ve been in the snailing game.\nDOCTOR: Snailing?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 16\nHORVAL: We’re snailers.\nDOCTOR: And what are “sSnailers”?\nTALBAR: You don’t know much, do you? It means we travel around in a Stellar Ammonite, salvaging wrecks.\nDOCTOR: A Stellar Ammonite?\nHORVAL: A space snail, to use laymen’s terms. Ours is about the size of a lunar shuttle. His name’s Hercules.\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nHORVAL: You’11 see him in the morning. Fastest gastropod in the Leevar cluster.\nDOCTOR: The quickest way around the galaxy is on the back of a snail?\nTALBAR: Not on the back. That’d be ridiculous. We’ve a control cabin implanted in his stomach, like normal. We access it via a catheter hatch.\nDOCTOR: And you use this... stellar ammonite to collect wreckage?\nTALBAR: Yes, pretty much... So who wants covey? Doctor, how do you take it, blue or green?\nDOCTOR: As it comes.\nTALBAR: We travel to battlegrounds from the Wrath War, search through the derelicts, and then tow away what we find in Hercules’ electro-magnetic slipstream.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 17\nHORVAL: It’s called a snail-trail. You should see it, it shines like a diamond chandelier.\nDOCTOR: I see. So you’re kind of intergalactic salvage men.\nTALBAR: If you like, but our main market’s Galdrium rather than textiles or skeletal tissue.\nDOCTOR: (DRINKS) Interesting. So how long ago was the Wrath war?\nTALBAR: Don’t know, must be getting on for fifty annum.\nDOCTOR: What happened, exactly?\nTALBAR: Not sure. According to my father, the Wrath were fighting the Drashani when suddenly this change came over them. Overnight they were transformed from a load of zombie- drones into judgement machines. He said it was like somebody had pressed a big switch.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Yes, I remember. (NORMAL) So what happened next?\nTALBAR: Well, to begin with, they were like guardian angels. But before we knew where we were they were more like avenging angels. They’d come across a planet they considered unjust and just... take it over like an invading army.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Programmed to uphold the rule of law, no matter what.\nTALBAR: Our only hope is that the other lot, the human empire, defeat them before we’re all under their digits.\nHORVAL: But that isn’t the worst of it.\nDOCTOR: It isn’t?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 18\nTALBAR: There are stories, Doctor. Rumours. That when they take over these worlds... they also take away people.\nDOCTOR: What for?\nTALBAR: Experimentation? Souvenirs? No-one knows.\nDOCTOR: Where do they take them?\nTALBAR: Back to the Wrath homeworld. Place they call The Shadow Heart.\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) The Shadow Heart...\nHORVAL: Did you hear that?\nTALBAR: The wall-roaches, something’s disturbed them.\nDOCTOR: Can’t you smell it? A morphotic catalyst. Someone is pumping sleeping gas into the ventilation system.\nTALBAR: I didn’t even know the ventilation system was working.\nHORVAL: But who’s doing it? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Look outside.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS HE SPEAKS, WE HEAR A HELICOPTER-LIKE SOUND FROM OUTSIDE THE BUILDING, GETTING LOUDER AS IT APPROACHES )\nTALBAR: A hovercopter!\nDOCTOR: Armed with laser harpoons. Get out of here, both of you.\nHORVAL: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 19\nTALBAR: Oh no, Doctor. You’re valuable merchandise. We’re not leaving you behind. (BEGINS COUGHING DUE TO GAS)\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. The bounty hunter piloting that hovercopter\nDOCTOR: wants me alive, but she will think nothing of killing you. Go!\nHORVAL: (COUGHING) But what about the sleeping gas? We’1ll never get out of the spotel!\nDOCTOR: Once she’s got me, she won’t bother with you. I hope.\nTALBAR: If you say so, Doctor. Good luck!\nVIENNA: (VIA TANNOY ) Move towards the window. (BEAT) That’s it. One more step.\nDOCTOR: (COUGHING, LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS) One more step? Oh, I see... I have to be in range of your grappling arm.\nVIENNA: (VIA TANNOY ) I advise you not to struggle. I’d hate to drop you from this height.\nDOCTOR: Struggle? I can barely keep my eyes... (FALLS ASLEEP)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BLEEPING B/G EFFECTS, DISTINCTIVE HUM. DOCTOR IS STRAPPED TO A TABLE, CONNECTED TO A MIND PROBE DEVICE)\nVIENNA: Alright. Time you woke up.\nDOCTOR: (WAKING) Where am I — oh, Miss Salvatori! This must be your spaceship, I presume? You wouldn’t happen to have made me a cup of tea by any chance?\nVIENNA: No.\nDOCTOR: Oh. It’d be quite tricky to drink it, strapped to this table of yours. Can’t say that I care for your hospitality.\nVIENNA: You wouldn’t even be conscious if it wasn’t necessary for the memory sifter to work.\nDOCTOR: Memory sifter? Don’t tell me. Some kind of a mind probe?\nVIENNA: Don’t try to resist, it will only cause you unnecessary pain.\nDOCTOR: (IN PAIN BUT RESISTING) That’s... what... they all say...\nVIENNA: Stimulating memnonic pathways. Activating neural imager. (BEAT) Don’t worry. I don’t want to see your whole life\nVIENNA: story. Just enough to ascertain who you are.\nDOCTOR: You... could... always... ask!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 21\nVIENNA: Not reliable enough, I’m afraid. Begin search. All memories containing item Prince Kylo of the Sorsha.\nDOCTOR: Never... heard... of him!\nDOCTOR: (FX: MACHINE PLAYS BACK MIXTURE OF SOUND EFFECTS AND VOICES FROM ‘THE BURNING PRINCE’ WITH A CLEAR LINE OF DIALOGUE FROM THE YOUNG KYLO)\nVIENNA: Then who’s that I see with him on the surface of Sharnax?\nVIENNA: (SOUND EFFECTS AND VOICES FROM THE ORPHEUS PULSE, A CLEAR LINE FROM CHENT)\nVIENNA: Or here in the skies of Cawdor? Your mind has betrayed you Doctor. Correlating memories with assignment crystal.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. This is all for the benefit of the crystal.\nKYLO: (VOICE OF CRYSTAL, DISTORT) Memories correspond with those in validation matrix. Identity confirmed - it is the Doctor!\nVIENNA: Excellent. So it really is you. The most wanted man in the twelve constellations.\nKYLO: (VIA CRYSTAL)\nKYLO: If you are hearing this message that means you have the Doctor in your custody. In order to receive your reward of ten thousand credits, he must be brought to me alive at the following co-ordinates.

Don’t you remember, Doctor? You showed me. You showed me your memory of me meeting you here, now.\nVIENNA: What was that?\nDOCTOR: A memory.\nVIENNA: But I’ve never met you before —\nDOCTOR: It’s not a memory of the past. It’s a memory of the future.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 23\nTALBAR: (WAKING) Oh my head. Whatever I had to drink last night, I hope it was worth it. Horval! Horval, wake up!\nHORVAL: (WAKING) Wha- what? Oh great-creator. I haven’t felt this bad since the morning after Apocalypto’s stag. (BEAT) Hey, what are we doing here? Must’ve passed out in the corridor.\nTALBAR: Don’t you remember? The Doctor said someone was pumping sleeping gas into the building.\nHORVAL: Oh, right. (REMEMBERS) The Doctor!\nTALBAR: Come on, get up, you’re making the floor look untidy.\nHORVAL: (BEING HELPED UP) Door’s still open —\nHORVAL: Oh, all the windows have been smashed, they’d better not put this on our bill!\nTALBAR: Must be how the gas dispersed. And it’s daylight out there. Must’ve been asleep for hours.\nHORVAL: No sign of the Doctor.\nTALBAR: No. But don’t worry. We’1ll get him back.\nHORVAL: We will? How?\nTALBAR: When I made him that covey, I slipped him a tracking bug. Just in case he went walkabout. All we have to do is home in on the signal and Pob’s your monkey.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 24\nHORVAL: You think of everything, Talbar!\nTALBAR: As the old saying goes, “he who prepares, wins”.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 25\nVIENNA: How can you have a memory of the future?\nDOCTOR: It’s a long story - and one I’m not going to tell you.\nVIENNA: Oh, you will tell me Doctor. Eventually. Begin search. All memories containing item Vienna Salvatori.\nVIENNA: (PLAYBACK) All memories containing item Vienna Salvatori.\nVIENNA: Not now, you fool, earlier. Show earliest memory.\nVIENNA: (PLAYBACK) Move towards the window. That’s it. One more step.\nDOCTOR: You see, I can control which of my memories your little gadget has access to. I only let you see my memories of Kylo because I wanted to find something out.\nVIENNA: Find what out?\nDOCTOR: Who you’re really working for. Because if you were working for Kylo Sorsha we would already be on our way to collect the reward.\nVIENNA: You’re very clever, Doctor. Which, in my experience, tends to dramatically shorten one’s life expectancy.\nDOCTOR: You could at least let me out of these straps! (BEAT) Oh, well. I suppose it’s good for my posture.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 26\nVIENNA: This is agent code xenon on encryption key-code alpha.

We have to get out of here.\nTALBAR: Hercules!\nDOCTOR: What?\nTALBAR: Hercules. He’s moored in the next stable-dock. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 29\nHORVAL: Be glad to get off this planet.

Wait a second, oh, no you don’t -\nDOCTOR: Think! If the Wrath find us together, they won’t reward you. They’1l execute you for aiding and abetting.\nHORVAL: Oh, yeah. Good point. Right.\nTALBAR: (QUIET) Typical, it would have to be the one thing we haven’t done!\nDOCTOR: Good luck, both of you.\nHORVAL: And to you too, Doctor.

We owe you one.\nDOCTOR: Good, I’1ll be keeping track. How’s Hercules?\nTALBAR: Not too bad. The mud’s helping him cool down from re- entry. That’s right, Herc, you have a good wallow.\nJANDOR: Will he be able to fly again?\nTALBAR: Not sure. He’s a tough old snail, most of his wounds should heal in a few hours.\nHORVAL: And in the meantime we’re stuck here.\nJANDOR: Doctor. Did you hear that?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I wonder... everyone. Back inside Hercules!\nTALBAR: What is it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 65\nDOCTOR: In the jungle, look!\nDOCTOR: (FX: ALIEN MONKEY-BATS SUDDENLY MUCH CLOSER, SWOOPING ALL\nAROUND: )\nHORVAL: What are they?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea.\nHORVAL: They look like... monkey-bats.

I will deliver the Doctor to you, once you have paid me my reward.\nKYLO: (COMPUTER VOICE) Payment will only be made on delivery of the Doctor.\nVIENNA: Well, then it seems we’re at an impasse. Perhaps I should seek remuneration elsewhere.\nKYLO: (COMPUTER VOICE) Wait. It may be possible to negotiate an arrangement.\nVIENNA: I only negotiate in person.

Oh, yeah, magic, holiday of a lifetime.\nJANDOR: I wish you’d let me shoot them, though.\nTALBAR: Well, at least they haven’t eaten us. That’s something.\nHORVAL: Yet. Where are we?\nTALBAR: I dunno. Some kind of platform or decking or something. Doesn’t seem to lead anywhere. Just up to that big tree.\nDOCTOR: I imagine it fulfils some kind of ceremonial purpose.\nHORVAL: Musical little fellas, aren’t they? Do you think they’re celebrating something?\nTALBAR: Yes. Dinner. Bagsy I get to be dessert.\nDOCTOR: No. These creatures don’t have the characteristics of evolved predators. I think they’re vegetarians.\nTALBAR: Vegetarians? Then what do they want us for?\nJANDOR: Because they’re not the ones doing the eating.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 70\nHORVAL: What?\nJANDOR: Look. The tree.\nJANDOR: (FX: THE TREE IS GROANING, A CAVERNOUS MOUTH YAWNING OPEN, GIVES A BOOMING, CREAKING GROAN)\nTALBAR: Or for crying out loud! A living tree!\nHORDAL: All trees are alive.\nTALBAR: You know what I mean!\nDOCTOR: Of course. We’re tribal sacrifices!\nTALBAR: You don’t have to sound so cheerful about it, Doctor!\nJANDOR: You mean that tree... is their god?\nTALBAR: Makes sense. I’m starting to have all sorts of religious thoughts right now. Look at it! Branches waving about like tentacles, trunk opening up like a great big... like a great big...\nHORVAL: Don’t say mouth. Do not say mouth.\nTALBAR: Gob, then, like a great big gob, that’d drive anyone to prayer...\nTALBAR: (FX: DRUMMING REACHES A CLIMAX.

Fascinated to death. (SHOVED) Careful!\nHORVAL: Any cunning plans to get us out of here would be appreciated.\nDOCTOR: My speciality.

You’ve led them right to us.\nHORVAL: And it was all going so well.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That wasn’t quite what I expected.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 73\nDERVISH: Sir. Scanners have just detected the thermo-signature of a laser weapon being discharged on the moon’s surface.\nWEBSTER: The Wrath, do you think?\nDERVISH: Don’t think so, sir, wrong thermo-signature.\nWEBSTER: Then somebody’s trying to attract our attention. Miss Dervish. Commence an aerial scan of the relevant area.\nDERVISH: Yes, sir.\nDERVISH: Sir, there seems to be some sort of altercation is progress between the Wrath and a local Chiropteran species. I’m also picking up four life signs.

We are now heading to the location of the stellar ammonite belonging to the two “snailers”.\nWEBSTER: Once it has been brought on board, return to a standing orbit until further orders.\nDERVISH: (VIA INTERCOM) Aye, aye, Sir.\nWEBSTER: Well, Doctor. What precisely do you want me to do?\nDOCTOR: I need you to order your fleet to the following co- ordinates.\nWEBSTER: Elliptic twelve? But that’s on the very edge of the galaxy, light years from anywhere.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The perfect place for a hideout.\nWEBSTER: And would you mind telling me what we’1ll find there?\nDOCTOR: Me.\nWEBSTER: You?\nDOCTOR: I’1ll be making my own way there. But when you see me again I won’t know you, because as far as I’m concerned, me meeting you now hasn’t happened yet.\nWEBSTER: (CONFUSED) I see.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 79\nDOCTOR: You must arrive in the system at the time specified, and not a moment before or after.\nWEBSTER: And then?\nDOCTOR: And then I’1ll tell you how to get close to the Wrath home-world without being detected.\nWEBSTER: But what’s at this place, in elliptic twelve?\nDOCTOR: The world of Thargross.

TINKLE OF WINDCHIMES AND ORNAMENTAL FOUNTAIN)\nVIENNA: Kylo Sorsha, I presume.\nKYLO: And you must be the mercenary known as Vienna Salvatori. Please, come in.\nVIENNA: Nice palace you’ve got here. If I’m not mistaken, a perfect reproduction of the Sorshan star chamber, made of crystalline barium silicate.\nKYLO: It fulfils my requirements.\nVIENNA: Hiding from the Wrath?\nKYLO: Maintaining a... low profile.\nVIENNA: From space you’d think this was a dead world. Some kind of force-shield, I imagine?\nKYLO: Something like that.\nVIENNA: You realise the Wrath have offered a reward for your capture?\nKYLO: Oh yes. A very substantial one, I should hope.\nVIENNA: So what is to stop me stunning you and taking you to them right now?\nKYLO: Should anyone attempt to harm me, these robots will sublimate their molecules in under one microsecond.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 81\nVIENNA: You’ve thought of everything.\nKYLO: In my experience one cannot be too careful. Particularly when dealing with mercenaries.\nVIENNA: I’m honoured that you agreed to grant me an audience.\nKYLO: And now you are here, perhaps you would care to give me the Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 82\nDOCTOR: How’s Hercules doing?\nTALBAR: Better than he was. The ship’s medics have stitched him up a treat, grown him some new membrane and everything.\nHORVAL: And Webster’s given us permission to stay on board until Herc’s back to his old self. Which shouldn’t be too long, digits crossed.\nDOCTOR: Glad to hear it. I’ve grown quite fond of the old chap.\nHORVAL: You saved his life, Doctor. And ammonites don’t forget.\nDOCTOR: He may get the opportunity to return the favour. That bug you slipped in my covey. It’s still functioning?\nTALBAR: Loud and clear, tuned to your pulse. Why do you ask?\nDOCTOR: Because I have a feeling it may come in useful very soon. Until we meet again, Talbar! Horval!\nTALBAR: Adios, Doctor! Adios!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 83\nJANDOR: So, what happens now, Doctor, we’re going to leave in the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: I am. But you’re not.\nJANDOR: What?\nDOCTOR: I need you to stay on board the Trafalgar.\nJANDOR: But —\nDOCTOR: Please, you have to trust me. One last thing before I go. When you meet me again, don’t tell me who you really are.\nJANDOR: But won’t you know who I am?\nDOCTOR: I have to work it out for myself. Otherwise things could\nDOCTOR: get even more confusing, if such a thing is possible. You must not reveal your true identity...not until the right\nDOCTOR: moment, anyway.\nJANDOR: Which will be?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’ll know.\nJANDOR: If I’m staying here, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Oh, to pay a visit on the Wrath. I think it’s time I finally handed myself in!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 84\nKYLO: Do I have to repeat the question? Where is the Doctor?\nVIENNA: Not until you’ve given me the ten thousand credits.\nKYLO: I think you don’t know where the Doctor is. You may have found some way of fooling the assignment crystal but you don’t fool me. Guards!\nKYLO: You have five seconds to give me the Doctor’s location or I will have you sublimated. Five. Four. Three.\nALIONA: Kylo!\nKYLO: Aliona, what is it —\nALIONA: The castle’s internal defences. They’ve detected something materialising in the lower crypt!\nKYLO: What? Show me!\nKYLO: (FX: MONITOR TURNED ON. WE HEAR THE TARDIS LANDING. VIA THE SCREEN, IT FINISHES LANDING AND ITS DOOR OPENS )\nVIENNA: There you are - the Doctor.

Sorry, you must’ve got the wrong number.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA TANNOY) Your transmat capsule has been positively identified and now so have your voice patterns. You are the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Voice patterns? But I sound nothing like him!\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA TANNOY) Negative. You have already verified your identity to us.\nDOCTOR: I have? When did I do that?\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA TANNOY) On the planet Temperance before you escaped in your capsule.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I did, did I? I must remember that. And what precisely is it you want me for, again?\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA SCANNER) You are to be taken to the Shadow Heart for judgement. You will surrender immediately.

That’s not the Wrath I remember. Something must have happened to cause them to change their nature.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 90\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) I wonder what it was...\nKYLO: This man is the Doctor?\nVIENNA: You saw him emerge from his blue capsule. This is the same man whose memories I validated with the crystal.\nALIONA: He is not how you described at all, my Lord Kylo.\nKYLO: The Doctor changes his manner like a dremareel changes its skin. (BEAT) You were expecting him to appear, Miss Salvatori?\nVIENNA: He wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me.\nKYLO: Then if you would be so kind as to bring him to me you shall have your reward.\nVIENNA: It will be a pleasure.\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Where am I, anyway? It seems to be some kind of crypt...\nKYLO: So, Doctor. To land in my own castle. You are either fearless or a fool. Because some of us do not forgive or forget.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 91\nDOCTOR: Maybe a little dusting of the sarcophagi will clue me in. Let’s see... an inscription. “Aliona”. (BEAT. NONPLUSSED)\nDOCTOR: Aliona? And if I’m still in Drashani territory that name’s worryingly familiar...\nVIENNA: Alright, that’s far enough.\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello. I’m the Doctor.\nVIENNA: I know who you are.\nDOCTOR: You do? I’m sorry, you have me at a disadvantage, in more ways than one. Who are you?\nVIENNA: You don’t know?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m afraid not. Should I?\nVIENNA: My name is Vienna Salvatori.\nDOCTOR: That’s not a name I’m likely to forget.\nVIENNA: And you are my prisoner. This way, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You were expecting me?\nVIENNA: Of course. Don’t you remember, Doctor? You showed me. You showed me your memory of me meeting you here, now.\nDOCTOR: Did I? And when did I show you this?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 92\nVIENNA: Yesterday. On Temperance. When I found you, you were with two snailers called Talbar and Horval.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t ring any bells, I’m afraid. May I enquire as to where you’re taking me?\nVIENNA: To meet an old friend.\nDOCTOR: Oh good. I like meeting old friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 93\nDOCTOR: Kylo Sorsha!\nKYLO: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You recognise me this time?\nKYLO: Not the face. But the attitude is certainly familiar.\nDOCTOR: Is it indeed. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. How long has it been since we last met?\nKYLO: Fifty years.\nDOCTOR: Really? That long? I’m always losing track of time. Occupational hazard.\nKYLO: I can imagine.\nDOCTOR: I must say, I do like your new home. A rib-vaulted ceiling with crystalline stalactites! Very Fortress Of Solitude.\nKYLO: May I... er... introduce Princess Aliona.\nDOCTOR: Princess Aliona! Now that’s even more remarkable!\nALIONA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, you’re looking very good for a... for your age. In fact, you don’t look a day older than the first time we met.\nALIONA: When we first met? I’ve never seen you before in my life.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 94\nDOCTOR: Haven’t you? No, of course not, I must be confusing you with somebody else.\nKYLO: Enough of this. (BEAT) Guards, restrain him.\nDOCTOR: (GRABBED) What? There’s no need...\nKYLO: Aliona, if you could do the honours.\nALIONA: Activating memory sifter. Begin search. Most recent memory containing item “Prince Kylo of House Sorsha”.\nALIONA: His memories correspond with your own, my lord.\nKYLO: Then he truly is the Doctor. (BEAT) Guards, release him.\nDOCTOR: There really was no need for that, you know. You really are most paranoid in your old age!\nKYLO: Not without good reason, Doctor. It is the only thing that has kept me alive all these years. Aliona, Miss Salvatori. I wish to speak to the Doctor alone.\nALIONA: As my lord desires.\nVIENNA: Kylo. We had a deal. What about —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 95\nKYLO: Your reward? You will receive your payment in the fullness of time. Now go!\nVIENNA: (BEAT) If you insist.\nALIONA: If you’d follow me.\nKYLO: Guards. At ease.\nDOCTOR: What did you mean, “the only thing that has kept you alive?”\nKYLO: Thanks to you, Doctor, I have been forced to endure the existence of a renegade.\nDOCTOR: Thanks to me? As I recall, when we last met, you were safe on the Cagliostro Prismosphere.\nKYLO: Did you expect me to remain there forever? Whilst my people burned without me? Whilst my homeworld was devastated beyond recognition?\nDOCTOR: Devastated? By what?\nKYLO: The Wrath. Reprogrammed to act as judge, jury and executioner over every other race in the galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Reprogrammed by who?\nKYLO: By you, Doctor. (SUDDEN RAGE) Don’t you remember? By you!\nDOCTOR: No. You’ve got it wrong. I reprogrammed them to be a force for good. I programmed them never to interfere.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 96\nKYLO: And on whose morality did you base this “programming”?\nDOCTOR: (REALISING) My own.\nKYLO: (CALMS DOWN) Precisely. They could not help but interfere. Where they see criminality, they will stop at nothing to punish the perpetrators. And they cannot help but see criminality everywhere they go...\nDOCTOR: Because if you look hard enough, everybody’s guilty of something.\nKYLO: Precisely. Programmed to uphold the rule of law, no matter what. I was too late. The Wrath had not only resumed their hostilities against the Drashani but against all the planets under their rule, a war that raged across the stars, and resulted in the destruction of a hundred worlds. A hundred worlds, boiled in flame!\nDOCTOR: No. I don’t believe you. You can’t hold me responsible for that.\nKYLO: Then who else is responsible, Doctor? Tell me? Who? WHO?\nKYLO: Nothing to say? Then I shall continue. I returned home to find my people obliterated, my empire destroyed. But that was not the end. Even when their dominion spanned half the galaxy, the Wrath were still unsatisfied. In particular, they wanted to locate the two people responsible for their creation. You, Doctor, and myself.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s nice to be wanted.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 97\nALIONA: While we are waiting for my highness, I can offer you refreshments. We have Storbuck milk, Banato juice, Lenoxitin...\nVIENNA: That won’t be necessary. But you can give me the grand tour.\nALIONA: What are you doing? If you kill me, my lord will not allow you to escape with your life.\nVIENNA: Then you’d better do as I say, or you’1ll have both our\nVIENNA: deaths on your conscience.\nALIONA: What do you want?\nVIENNA: The room that controls this palace’s defences. Show me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 98\nKYLO: Wherever I went, the Wrath were never far behind. I had no choice but to flee to this world, a world left for dead. The planet Thargross.\nDOCTOR: This is Thargross? But I thought -\nKYLO: This world was once the home of a proud civilisation? But then it was split asunder in the fires of war. Literally.\nDOCTOR: Literally?\nKYLO: A world sheered in two, one half reduced to dust and vapour, the other half remaining, a perfect hemisphere suspended in the void.\nDOCTOR: Quite the semi-detached.\nKYLO: And it was here I sought sanctuary, in a castle at the edge of the world. Allow me to show you.\nKYLO: (FX: BUTTON PRESSED, ELECTRONIC WINDOW SLIDES OPEN. THE SOUND OF THE WIND AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN)\nKYLO: This balcony gazes out into the darkness of space. But look down - and there is a drop of four thousand miles, all the way down to the fires of the molten core.\nDOCTOR: And you’ve been hiding here from the Wrath ever since?\nKYLO: Indeed. This planet is surrounded by a force-shield of my own design to prevent discovery. As far as any passing ships are concerned we do not exist.\nDOCTOR: Most ingenious, you really must tell me how it’s done.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 99\nVIENNA: Inside!\nALIONA: You never intended to deliver the Doctor. That was just a ruse to gain entrance to this castle.\nVIENNA: Well done, not just a pretty face. (BEAT) Deactivating all internal defences and planetary force-shield.\nALIONA: But if you do that, we’ll be detectable to any ship that\nALIONA: enters this solar system.\nVIENNA: That is the general idea. And just to make it permanent.\nALIONA: You’ve condemned us all to death.\nVIENNA: Not quite.\nVIENNA: This is agent code xenon, calling Wrath justice fleet. I — (HIT)\nALIONA: I will not let you betray my Lord Kylo!\nVIENNA: Such misguided loyalty. The dog scurries back to its\nVIENNA: master.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 100\nVIENNA: This is agent code xenon calling Wrath justice fleet.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA RADIO) Wrath leader receiving.\nVIENNA: I have located the Doctor and Kylo Sorsha as promised. They are here on the planet Thargross...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 101\nDOCTOR: Still, at least you have your robots to serve you, and Aliona to keep you company. You extracted her DNA from the Royal Carcarnet, I presume? Tell me, does she know that she’s a clone?\nKYLO: She believes herself to be the true Princess and my perfect companion. I love her, and she loves me.\nDOCTOR: I doubt you gave her much choice in the matter. Mentally conditioned from the first moment of life. Which was how long ago, exactly? One year? One month? One day? And how many more Alionas can you make until the pattern becomes unusable?\nKYLO: You ask too many questions, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” One more question. What do you plan to do with me? Kill me?\nKYLO: Death would be meagre recompense for the suffering you\nKYLO: have caused. I shall take my revenge upon you a hundred- fold.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure you’ll get the chance.\nKYLO: What?\nDOCTOR: Look up.\nKYLO: What are you talking (about)? No... it can’t be...\nDOCTOR: The Wrath justice fleet heading directly towards us. It\nDOCTOR: seems you have visitors!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 102\nKYLO: It is of no matter, this castle cannot be detected while the force-shield remains operational...\nKYLO: No... deactivated? I have been betrayed!\nDOCTOR: Don’t look at me, I was here with you the whole time!\nKYLO: Computer, show me the castle defence chamber. Computer!\nKYLO: Respond. Respond! Useless, all the security monitors have been deactivated! (BEAT) Doctor, I —\nDOCTOR: Sorry, must dash! (SKIDS ON FLOOR AS HE RUNS, WOAH!)\nKYLO: Doctor! Guards, recapture the Doctor at once. Guards! (REALISATION) Deactivated! Deactivated along with everything else! (SCREAM OF RAGE)\nKYLO: (FX: A DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM OPENS AND CLOSES. ALIONA RUNS IN)\nALIONA: (BREATHLESS) Kylo!\nKYLO: (CONTROLLING TEMPER) Aliona, my love, what is it?\nALIONA: That bounty hunter, she’s shut down all the defences, all the robots. She’s contacted the Wrath.\nKYLO: I knew that woman couldn’t be trusted.\nALIONA: You knew? My lord, I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 103\nKYLO: No, of course you don’t. Listen. The Wrath will be within these walls in a matter of minutes. You must leave while you still have the chance.\nALIONA: But how, my Lord?\nKYLO: I have prepared an escape capsule for such an eventuality. It is force-shielded and has its own independent power source.\nALIONA: But -\nKYLO: You will be able to reach it through the upper crypt. It will take you to a place of safety. Now. You must go!\nALIONA: But what about you? Will you not be coming with me?\nKYLO: No. If the Wrath do not find me... they will know that a capsule has been launched. So, the moment you are inside the capsule you must depart. Understand?\nALIONA: I understand. But I do not want to go.\nKYLO: You must. We shall meet again, I promise.\nALIONA: But the Wrath —\nKYLO: The Wrath? You are my beloved. My one true desire. Not all the demons of the undervoid could keep me from my Aliona.\nALIONA: I love you, Kylo.\nKYLO: If you love me, Aliona, you will do as I say.\nALIONA: As my lord desires.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 104\nKYLO: Until we meet again my love.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 105\nDOCTOR: Which way? Down here? No, down here! Ha! The TARDIS!\nVIENNA: That’s quite far enough, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Vienna Salvatori. Sorry to be rude, but there’s a Wrath justice fleet about to land, and I’d rather not be here when they do.\nVIENNA: You’re not going anywhere. You’re far too valuable to me.\nDOCTOR: Valuable?\nVIENNA: Indeed. The only drawback is that unfortunately you’re worth more to me alive.\nDOCTOR: Worth more to who? Who are you working for?\nVIENNA: You already know the answer to that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I do?\nVIENNA: Move away from your capsule, Doctor. Or I will fire.\nDOCTOR: Then you'll just have to shoot me —\nVIENNA: Oh no you don’t!\nDOCTOR: (HIT, IN GREAT PAIN) Didn’t think... you’d... do it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DURING THE ABOVE, HE SLIPS INSIDE TARDIS, SHUTS THE DOOR)\nVIENNA: No, Doctor! Doctor!\nVIENNA: No, you don’t, I - (BEAT) Of course — a time machine! So that’s how you ended up in Starbaff’s bar with a wound in your chest...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 107\nWRATH LEADER: This planet has now been placed under the jurisdiction of the Wrath justice fleet. Any attempt to leave will result in obliteration.\nKYLO: So. You are here at last.\nWRATH LEADER: Identify yourself.\nKYLO: Don’t you recognise me? I was your master once.\nWRATH LEADER: Identify yourself.\nKYLO: I am Prince Kylo of the Sorsha.\nWRATH LEADER: Identity verified. You are a fugitive from justice and are to be taken to the Shadow Heart for judgement.\nKYLO: I am honoured. I knew you wanted me taken alive for some reason.\nWRATH LEADER: Where are the Doctor and Salvatori?\nKYLO: Salvatori? I assume she’s the one who led you here?\nWRATH LEADER: Where are the Doctor and Salvatori?\nKYLO: I don’t know. All the castle’s security systems have been deactivated. You find them.\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO) Wrath leader. Sensors detect a craft about to take-off.\nKYLO: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 108\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO) Craft identified. It is an escape capsule.\nWRATH LEADER: Order Wrath imperial frigate to destroy the craft.\nKYLO: No. No. Please, it’s not possible, I programmed the systems myself, it’s undetectable!\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO) Capsule detected. Target locked. Activating laser cannon.\nKYLO: No! No, please you don’t have to do this! Aliona! Aliona!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE CAPSULE FLYING THROUGH SPACE. LASER DISCHARGE. THE CAPSULE EXPLODES )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 110\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO) Capsule destroyed.\nKYLO: No. No. By all the fires of the undervoid, no!(BEAT, THEN CONTINUES, CLUTCHING AT STRAWS) A malfunction, it must be. Unless she deliberately deactivated the force- shield... (REALISATION) Aliona.\nWRATH LEADER: Prisoner Kylo is to be transferred to Wrath pursuit ship.\nKYLO: What? But of course. Do what you want with me. With Aliona gone, nothing you can do can hurt me now.\nWRATH LEADER: Wrath division will conduct a complete search of this complex. The Doctor and Salvatori must be found!\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO)\nWRATH ONE: Wrath Leader! We have located Salvatori’s space vessel in one of the underground docking stations.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 111\nVIENNA: Computer, commence launch!\nVIENNA: Too slow, my Wrath friends! Computer, prepare for warp.\nVIENNA: What do you mean, warp-drive not functioning?\nVIENNA: What in the seven moons are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Miss Salvatori. Hope you don’t mind me dropping in.\nVIENNA: Your travel capsule!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I landed it in your ship. Neat bit of parking, even if I do say so myself.\nVIENNA: Right. So let me see. You’re not injured any more, but you know my name... it can’t be earlier in your timeline, so it must be later... After you left Temperance?\nDOCTOR: Precisely, you’re getting the hang of it. The last time we met as far as I’m concerned was about five minutes ago in Starbaff’s bar. Sorry I couldn’t stick around but I had a Wrath patrol after me.\nVIENNA: Why are you here, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I thought I’d pop back and see you for a chat. Well, pop forward. You’ve just told me that you’re working for the Wrath.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 112\nVIENNA: As I told you then, I work for whoever pays the highest\nVIENNA: price.\nVIENNA: And now you’re my prisoner.\nVIENNA: This is\nVIENNA: agent code xenon calling Wrath justice fleet. I\nVIENNA: have captured the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Won’t do you any good, I’m afraid. You see, before you\nDOCTOR: came on\nVIENNA: You did through\nVIENNA: board, I disabled your communications port.\nVIENNA: what? But don’t you realise, if I can’t get to the Wrath, they’re going to destroy this ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 113\nWRATH LEADER: Place the prisoner Kylo in a holding cell.\nKYLO: So this is how you treat your former master, is it?\nWRATH ONE: Wrath division reports that Salvatori’s space vessel has just launched from the planet’s surface.\nWRATH LEADER: She has breached her contract with the Wrath. Prepare to obliterate the craft!\nWRATH ONE: Target locked and in range. Activating laser cannon.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 114\nVIENNA: They’re firing at us. You idiot, in a few seconds we’1l\nVIENNA: be dead!\nDOCTOR: Then you’1l have to come with me in the TARDIS.\nVIENNA: What?\nDOCTOR: It’s our only chance. Well, don’t just stand there!\nVIENNA: Something’s happening... we’re being dragged off course... some kind of electromagnetic attraction...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 115\nTALBAR: We’ve got them?\nHORVAL: Yep. Hercules has the ship right in his E-M slipstream!\nTALBAR: Good work. Alright, let’s tow them alongside!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 116\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader! Salvatori’s vessel is accelerating out of range!\nWRATH LEADER: Then we must maintain pursuit. We must not set a legal precedent!\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader, the vessel is on an intercept course with an Earth Empire fleet! Sensors detect eight vessels.\nWRATH LEADER: We must not engage unless absolutely necessary. Contact the Shadow Heart for clarification of our legal position.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART -— by Jonathan Morris Page 117\nVIENNA: Is this your doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Unless it’s something I haven’t got around to doing yet. I live a complicated life.\nVIENNA: We’re being dragged right into the middle of an Earth Empire patrol fleet.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think they’ve saved our lives!\nVIENNA: That’s the outer airlock, someone’s forcing it. But there’s nothing out there, nothing registering on the scanners.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but scanners can be fooled.\nVIENNA: You!\nTALBAR: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Talbar and Horval! What a lovely surprise!\nHORVAL: Hardly a surprise, Doctor. This was your idea.\nDOCTOR: It was? You must let me tell you all about it later. How did you know I was here? Oh, no, wait. The tracking device you slipped in my covey!\nTALBAR: Miss Salvatori, if you could drop the weapon?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 118\nVIENNA: No. If you take so much as one step towards me, I’1l1 kill the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: A hollow threat. Because then Talbar and Horval would simply hand you over to the Wrath and the Wrath would put you to death.\nTALBAR: Yes. We’d have no choice, it would be our duty as good, honest, law-abiding citizens.\nHORVAL: And we'd collect the reward. I mean, ten thousand credits, that’s enough to buy half a planet.\nDOCTOR: Or all of Thargross. Well, Miss Salvatori? If you are going to kill me, I’d rather you got it over with.\nVIENNA: Alright, you can have him.\nTALBAR: Then drop the weapon.\nVIENNA: I’ve wasted enough of my life chasing this fool around the galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Miss Salvatori, you say the sweetest things. (BEAT) Talbar, Horval?\nTALBAR: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Take her prisoner.\nVIENNA: What —\nDOCTOR: If she moves so much as a micron, zap her.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 119\nTALBAR: Doctor. If it’s alright with you, we’ve put Hercules on a course to return to HMS Trafalgar.\nDOCTOR: The HMS Trafalgar?\nTALBAR: The flagship of the seventeenth Earth fleet. Captain Webster’s very keen to meet you.\nDOCTOR: Is he? Well, I’m very keen to meet him. Whoever he is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 120\nGUARD: (VIA INTERCOM) The stellar ammonite has returned to the hold, captain.\nWEBSTER: Excellent. What about its crew, and the enigmatic Doctor?\nGUARD: (VIA INTERCOM) They’re on their way up to the bridge now, sir.\nWEBSTER: And this bounty hunter woman, what was her name?\nGUARD: (VIA INTERCOM) Salvatori. I’m just about to escort her to the brig now, sir.\nWEBSTER: Good work, midshipman. Stand guard over her, one can never be too careful with these mercenary types.\nGUARD: Aye aye, Sir. (VIA INTERCOM)\nWEBSTER: Ah, Doctor. Glad you could make it.\nDOCTOR: Glad you could make it too. You arrived just in the nick of time!\nWEBSTER: Hardly a coincidence. Your instructions were to find you at these exact coordinates.\nDOCTOR: They were? I really must stop getting ahead of myself, Captain...er, Webster, I presume?\nWEBSTER: Of course. The last time I saw you, you said that when I met you again you wouldn’t recognise me.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I was right. Because me telling you that hasn’t happened yet, as far as I’m concerned.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 121\nTALBAR: Are you following any of this, Horval?\nHORVAL: Yeah. Makes perfect sense.\nTALBAR: You wouldn’t mind drawing me a diagram when you have a spare moment?\nDOCTOR: Just to refresh my memory, when was the last time I met you?\nWEBSTER: About six hours ago. Just after we found you on the Marsh Moon of Magros Five.\nTALBAR: You remember? They rescued us at the last minute after you got your friend Jandor to fire into the air.\nDOCTOR: My friend Jandor?\nJANDOR: Doctor. We met before, in Starbaff’s bar.\nDOCTOR: Yes. So I know you, do I? Who are you exactly? What face lies beneath that mask?\nJANDOR: I’m afraid I’ve been given strict instructions not to say.\nDOCTOR: You have? By who?\nJANDOR: By you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh. How irritating. Your uniform... of course! It’s a Galbaresan survival suit. With a filtration mask. The perfect disguise. Which means that if you are who I think you are, I have an idea for a plan.\nHORVAL: You do?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 122\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Captain Webster, have I already outlined my plan to you?\nWEBSTER: No. You said that when I met you here, you’d tell me how we could get close to the Wrath home-world without being detected.\nDOCTOR: Well, in that case, I suppose I’d better do so. Talbar, Horval?\nTALBAR: & HORVAL: Yeah?\nDOCTOR: I suggest you take notes. It’s going to get a little complicated.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 123\nGUARD: In here.\nVIENNA: What - so you can transport me back to Earth and lock me in one of your corrective institutions?\nGUARD: Not for me to say, ma’am.\nVIENNA: I assume you’ve been ordered to keep me under armed guard, is that right?\nGUARD: Correct.\nVIENNA: Tip for you. Next time, before locking someone up, always check they don’t have any concealed weapons first.\nGUARD: What -? (ZAPPED)\nVIENNA: Where do they find these people? Pathetic.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 124\nDOCTOR: So. Have you got all that?\nWEBSTER: I think so. And where will you be, while we’re approaching the Wrath home-world?\nDOCTOR: Me? Oh, I’1ll be on the Wrath home-world, I expect.\nDERVISH: What?\nDOCTOR: They’ve been so keen to get hold of me, I don’t really have the heart to disappoint them. You all know what to do?\nTALBAR: I think so.\nHORVAL: And I’ve written it all down, just in case.\nWEBSTER: What in the name of her majesty -!?\nDERVISH: The guard sent to escort Vienna to the brig... he’s just woken up.\nWEBSTER: You mean she’s at large on board my ship?\nDERVISH: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: But if she manages to contact the Wrath... she’1l tell them I’m on board. This wasn’t supposed to happen!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 125\nVIENNA: Silence, you miserable animal, or I’1ll stimulate every pain centre in your cerebral cortex.\nVIENNA: Right. Now. Move. (BEAT) Take off, curse you. Take off!\nVIENNA: Don’t make me have to punish you. You just do as you’re told and I won’t hurt you any more than is necessary.\nVIENNA: This is agent code xenon calling Wrath justice fleet.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 126\nVIENNA: (VIA RADIO)\nVIENNA: I am on board a stellar ammonite about to depart from the Earth galleon Trafalgar. The Doctor is on board the Earth vessel. I repeat, the Doctor is on board!\nWRATH LEADER: You will rendezvous with the Wrath justice fleet. Any attempt to evade justice will result in incineration.\nWRATH LEADER: Prepare an expeditionary force to board the Earth vessel.\nWRATH ONE: Preparing boarding pods.\nWRATH LEADER: Bring us within laser cannon range of the Earth vessel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 127\nDERVISH: Sir, I think I’ve located Miss Salvatori — and I’m afraid she’s no longer on board.\nTALBAR: Look! She’s stolen Hercules!\nHORVAL: What!\nDERVISH: And she’s heading for the Wrath fleet.\nHORVAL: Oh, no, Herc!\nWEBSTER: Scurrying back to her paymasters, no doubt.\nDERVISH: Sensors detect... they are preparing their laser cannons to fire.\nWEBSTER: Then raise shields and prepare to return fire.\nDERVISH: Raising shields. Energising bow blasters.\nWEBSTER: (HERE & OVER TANNOY) Tricolour alert! All hands to action stations. Repeat.\nWEBSTER: All hands to action stations!\nDERVISH: Receiving an incoming communication, sir.\nWEBSTER: Put it on the overhead scanner.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR) This is Wrath leader calling the HMS Trafalgar.\nHMS: Trafalgar receiving.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 128\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR)\nWRATH LEADER: We have reason to believe you are harbouring a fugitive from Wrath justice known as the Doctor. Either you will hand the Doctor over to us immediately, or we will have no alternative but to commence hostilities.\nWEBSTER: We do not take orders from the Wrath. You have no jurisdiction over us.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR) Then prepare to be boarded.\nDERVISH: Sir, I’m detecting five boarding pods being launched from\nDERVISH: the Wrath frigate. And they’re firing their laser cannons!\nWEBSTER: Hold hard. Damage report?\nDERVISH: Bow shields down to fifteen per-cent. Don’t think we can\nDERVISH: take much more of this, sir.\nWEBSTER: Then it seems we have no alternative but return fire.\nWEBSTER: Doctor, what do you — where’s the Doctor?\nTALBAR: I don’t know.\nHORVAL: Where’d he go? Jandor?\nJANDOR: Must have slipped away.\nDERVISH: Sir - he’s just entered the spacecraft belonging to the woman Salvatori!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 129\nWEBSTER: What? What does he think he’s playing at? Get me a visual.\nDERVISH: Accessing internal cameras...\nWEBSTER: Doctor. What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Ah. Captain Webster. If you’1ll excuse me, but a Doctor’s got to do what a Doctor’s go to do...\nWEBSTER: What on - ?\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) See you earlier!\nTALBAR: He’s running out on us! Doing a bunk!\nHORVAL: Leaving us to face the music. And they’re playing a death\nHORVAL: march!\nDERVISH: Shields now down to five per-cent, sir.\nDERVISH: Extensive structural damage. Warp-drive destroyed.\nWEBSTER: Casualties?\nDERVISH: None to report, sir, but they’ve knocked out our remaining shields. We’re defenceless!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 130\nWEBSTER: Miss Dervish, open a communication channel with the Wrath.\nDERVISH: Aye, aye, Sir.\nWEBSTER: This is the HMS Trafalgar calling the Wrath fleet leader...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 131\nWRATH LEADER: Wrath leader receiving. Are you willing to place the Doctor in our custody?\nWEBSTER: (VIA MONITOR) I’m afraid that option is not available to us. The Doctor is no longer on board.\nWRATH LEADER: Attempting to deceive the Wrath in the course of their duties is an offence!\nWEBSTER: (VIA MONITOR) No, I’m telling the truth, he’s already left in his own transmat capsule.\nWRATH LEADER: The Wrath expeditionary force will ascertain this for themselves. Prepare to be boarded.\nWEBSTER: (VIA MONITOR) And you should prepare to meet resistance. We will fight you until the last man!\nWRATH LEADER: You will need to.\nWRATH ONE: Dimensional disturbance on bridge. Dimensional disturbance on bridge!\nDOCTOR: Hello. I thought it was time I handed myself in.\nWRATH LEADER: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m giving myself up. So slap on the handcuffs, it’s a fair cop.

Dimensional disturbance on bridge!\nDOCTOR: Hello. I thought it was time I handed myself in.\nWRATH LEADER: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m giving myself up. So slap on the handcuffs, it’s a fair cop. (BEAT) Take me to your leader!\nWRATH LEADER: Identity verified. You are a fugitive from justice and are to be taken to the Shadow Heart for judgement.\nDOCTOR: I recommend you confiscate my travel capsule while you’re ate at.\nWRATH LEADER: The capsule is to be moved to the hold. Place the Doctor in a cell.\nDOCTOR: No need to push, I’m your willing captive.\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader. Should the expeditionary force continue their mission?\nWRATH LEADER: No. Recall them to this ship. The Doctor and Kylo must be returned to the Shadow Heart with utmost expediency.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 133\nWRATH ONE: Recalling boarding pods.\nWRATH LEADER: The Earth empire vessel can no loner enter warp and otherwise has only limited motive capability. We shall return and dispense justice at our convenience.\nWRATH ONE: Wrath Leader, the stellar ammonite piloted by agent\nWRATH ONE: Salvatori has just entered the docking bay.\nWRATH LEADER: Have her restrained and placed in a holding cell.\nWRATH ONE: And the ammonite?\nWRATH LEADER: It is an innocent creature. Eject it into space.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 134\nWEBSTER: Lieutenant Dervish, damage report?\nDERVISH: Life support functioning. But we’re stuck here, sir. Limited engine power but the warpdrive’s gone.\nJANDOR: It looks like the Wrath fleet is preparing to leave...\nTALBAR: Well, they’ve got what they’ve come for, haven’t they?\nHORVAL: Why did the Doctor had to give himself up.\nTALBAR: Because, Horval, if he hadn’t, we’d all be dead.\nDERVISH: And they’ve gone.\nWEBSTER: Miss Dervish, can you trace their course?\nDERVISH: Analyzing anti-matter residue. They’re heading back into Wrath space. Putting the co-ordinates on the screen.\nJANDOR: So now we know the location of the Wrath homeworld.\nTALBAR: And they’ve taken Herc with them. I’1ll miss him, the old thing.\nDERVISH: No, wait... the stellar ammonite, they must have left it\nDERVISH: behind. It’s propelling itself back towards us!\nHORVAL: He knows we’re here!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 135\nTALBAR: There’s no creature more loyal than a space snail.\nWEBSTER: So, it looks like there’s still a chance we can implement the Doctor’s plan after all...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 136\nWRATH: Inside. You will remain here until you face judgement.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I look forward to it.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Hello over there.\nKYLO: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, at least I’m not alone.\nKYLO: We've just gone into warp. They’re taking us home.\nDOCTOR: Won’t be long now. I would give you a recital on the spoons to pass the time, but unfortunately, no spoons.\nKYLO: Then that is something to be grateful for.\nDOCTOR: Cheer up. The Wrath want us alive for a reason. Aren’t you curious to find out?\nKYLO: Find out? You think I care? It hardly matters now that Aliona is dead.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, the capsule, of course, I’m sorry, what a waste. But Aliona was only ever a clone, wasn’t she? You can always make another.\nKYLO: She was the last.\nDOCTOR: The last?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 137\nKYLO: You were right, Doctor. The cloning process is inherently unstable. Each time I cloned her, her lifetime was reduced. Until she could live but for a single year.\nDOCTOR: That’s the danger with making a copy of a copy. Eventually the pattern fades.\nKYLO: It was all for her, you understand? Everything I have done was all for her.\nDOCTOR: So you cloned her, conditioned her to love you, made her your prisoner. Funny way to show your gratitude.\nWRATH ONE: Inside!\nVIENNA: You traitorous - Is this how you repay me for delivering you the Doctor and Kylo?\nWRATH ONE: You have repeatedly misrepresented and broken contractual arrangements with the Wrath empire. Your case is to be referred to the supreme authority on the Shadow Heart.\nVIENNA: You will give me my fifty thousand credits and let me go!\nDOCTOR: Fifty thousand? The Wrath must’ve wanted us very badly.\nKYLO: Be grateful they’ve placed us in separate cells, Salvatori. You caused the death of my one true love. I will be happy to return the favour.\nVIENNA: You think you can threaten me, old man? Look at you. Not so strong without your robots to protect you, now are you? I could break your spinal column with my ulnar digit! And I will if you even try to attack me, Wrath or no Wrath.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 138\nKYLO: (COWED) I -\nVIENNA: I’m a bounty hunter. What did you expect me to do? You should’ve known I’d betray you to them.\nKYLO: (BEAT) Yes. Yes, I suppose I should.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it was rather naive of you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE AIR TRAFFIC/SECURITY CONTROL ROOM ON THE WRATH HOME-WORLD.

(MORE, AD-LIB)\nVIENNA: But what does it need them for?\nWRATH EMPEROR: We needed new instructions.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK) What do you mean, new instructions?\nWRATH EMPEROR: We were programmed to uphold a moral framework. But that framework was found to be full of logical contradictions.\nKYLO: Just like its programmer.\nVIENNA: What?\nDOCTOR: I programmed the Wrath, gave them my own personal morality. (CALLS OUT) It wasn’t supposed to be consistent!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 143\nWRATH EMPEROR: We needed new instructions. So we searched for others who could provide order.\nDOCTOR: You kidnapped innocent beings from across the galaxy to see if they could solve your ethical dilemmas?\nWRATH EMPEROR: The law must be without fault.\nDOCTOR: No. The law must be flexible. There’s an exception to every rule!\nKYLO: It seems you didn’t set it a very good example, Doctor.\nVIENNA: (CALLING OUT) But why do you want the Doctor and Kylo?\nWRATH EMPEROR: To give us new instructions.\nDOCTOR: Of course. It remembers us. Its former masters!\nVIENNA: This thing wants you to reprogramme it?\nWRATH EMPEROR: All errors will be corrected. All inconsistencies will be reconciled.\nDOCTOR: And if we refuse?\nWRATH EMPEROR: It is within our power to eradicate every world in the Wrath empire until you agree.\nDOCTOR: Alright. I’1l1 do what you want. But on one condition. All the people you’ve enslaved have to be set free.\nWRATH EMPEROR: Impossible. The Imperial Engine gives them life. But if you give us new instructions, they will have freedom of thought and deed.\nDOCTOR: Then I agree.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 144\nWRATH EMPEROR: You may access our control matrices. But be warned. Any attempt to sabotage our function will be punished.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I am aware of your guards’... watchful presence.\nVIENNA: You can’t be serious? You’re really going to give it what it wants?\nDOCTOR: Why not? With a new morality, the Wrath can be a force for good.\nKYLO: (MOCKING) I think you may have said that before.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But this time I’1l get it right.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART -— by Jonathan Morris\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader. Sensors detect an unauthorised vessel\nWRATH ONE: entering Shadow Heart system.\nWRATH LEADER: Visual display.\nWRATH ONE: A stellar ammonite.\nWRATH LEADER: What is that trailing behind it?\nWRATH ONE: Page 145\nWRATH ONE: Sensors detect no energy signs. It appears to be derelict\nWRATH ONE: material.\nWRATH LEADER: Open a communication channel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 146\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA RADIO) You are intruding into Wrath space. Identify yourselves.\nTALBAR: Ah, hello there. Sorry, we must have got lost, our guidance systems are playing up.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA RADIO) What is the material in your electro-magnetic slipstream?\nHORVAL: That? Oh, just scrap. Nothing but space wreckage.\nTALBAR: You’re welcome to put in an offer. Thirteen megaweight of processed Galdrium, if you fancy taking it off our hands.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA RADIO) The Empire has sufficient Galdrium resources. You will leave Wrath space or face punitive disintegration.\nTALBAR: Ah, now that might be tricky, you see once Hercules has made up his mind he’s going somewhere, it’s the devil’s own job trying to stop him.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA RADIO) Then you will be disintegrated. You have no right of appeal and can make no appeal for clemency.\nTALBAR: Right. Now fingers crossed, the Doctor was right about\nTALBAR: this.\nHORVAL: Or we are both very, very dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 147\nWRATH LEADER: Prepare to obliterate the creature!\nWRATH ONE: Target locked and in range. Activating laser cannon.\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader. All power to our laser cannons has been\nWRATH ONE: disconnected.\nWRATH LEADER: Explain!\nWRATH ONE: All defence systems now non-operational. The planetary energy barrier has been deactivated!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 148\nWRATH EMPEROR: Doctor. You have interfered with the Wrath defence systems!\nDOCTOR: Yes. I was wondering when you would notice.\nWRATH EMPEROR: You will restore defence systems immediately. Or you will be punished.\nDOCTOR: But if you kill me, I won’t be able to turn them back on.\nWRATH EMPEROR: You will not be killed. The Wrath can cause pain without compromising your nervous system. Restore all defences systems, Doctor. (BEAT) Commence punishment.\nKYLO: I don’t think so.\nVIENNA: What the —\nDOCTOR: Kylo Sorsha, you’re full of surprises!\nKYLO: You think I’d lost my powers? Oh, how you underestimate me, Doctor! The flame still burns, hotter than ever!\nVIENNA: He just... blew them up! He threw fireballs from his hands!\nKYLO: Still think you could kill me now, Salvatori? Emperor!\nWRATH EMPEROR: This is an act of aggression. You will —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 149\nDOCTOR: Kylo Sorsha here is a pyro-kinetic. But the effects were far more primal when we met before, these are far more directed.\nKYLO: I have spent many years perfecting and controlling my abilities, Doctor. Just for this. Just for this moment. Now. You will seal this chamber before any more Wrath enter.\nDOCTOR: Will I, indeed?\nKYLO: I have the power within my fingertips to sear the flesh from your bones. You will do as I command, or you will feel the heat of my rage!\nDOCTOR: Then I appear not to have much choice...\nKYLO: Thank you. I’m glad you’ve decided to co-operate. You will reprogramme the Imperial Engine to serve me! The Wrath must recognise me as their Emperor!\nDOCTOR: Oh, must they?\nKYLO: I have dreamed of this moment for so long, Doctor. The moment when I would once again take control of the Wrath. To once again reign over the Empire that you stole from me!\nDOCTOR: So that’s been your plan all along.\nKYLO: Of course. You think I didn’t know the reason why the Wrath were so desperate to track us down? You think I didn’t know that Miss Salvatori was working for the Wrath and would betray us at the earliest opportunity?\nVIENNA: You wanted to be brought here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 150\nKYLO: With the Doctor. I could not permit myself to be captured until I was sure he would be captured alongside me.\nDOCTOR: So, not so naive after all.\nKYLO: Oh, Doctor, I have always been one step ahead.\nDOCTOR: What exactly do you intend to do?\nKYLO: My people are gone, Doctor! Absorbed into this machine. But with the Wrath at my command, I can create a new Empire, a new Legacy. The Drashani can live!\nDOCTOR: They’re gone, Kylo. Gone like Aliona, you’ve got to stop clinging to the past.\nKYLO: I did this all for her, you know. We were to rule together as we were supposed to have done those many years ago. The way it should have been. But now she is dead, I will rule in tribute to her memory. As a sign of devotion! I will expand, conquer, destroy, take the Empire to glory it has never known! I will rule over all!\nDOCTOR: You think that’s what she’d want?\nKYLO: All that matters now is what I want. And I want you to reprogramme that machine!\nDOCTOR: No.\nKYLO: No?\nDOCTOR: No. Do your worst! Sear my — what was it — flesh from my bones?\nKYLO: Do as I command. Or I will burn Miss Salvatori alive!\nDOCTOR: Go ahead. Kill her. It’s no skin off my nose.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 151\nKYLO: What?\nDOCTOR: She’s a mercenary, a hired killer. The universe would be better off without her.\nKYLO: You’re bluffing, Doctor. I know you of old, you would never stand back and let someone die.\nDOCTOR: That may have been true once. But I think you’1ll find, I’m not quite the man I used to be.\nKYLO: Do you need me to prove myself to you? Very well.\nVIENNA: By the seven moons, I think he means it!\nKYLO: I will count to three, then I will scorch this woman’s face from her skull. One. Two. Th-\nDOCTOR: Alright. alright. 2711: do; 14\nKYLO: You see, Doctor. I know you better than you know yourself.\nDOCTOR: You do realise, if I do this, what it means?\nKYLO: I do.\nDOCTOR: You will become part of the machine, plugged into it, never to leave, like all these other poor souls?\nKYLO: To have dominion over the Wrath, over everything...it is a price worth paying.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 152\nWRATH ONE: (VIA RADIO) Wrath leader. We are unable to enter the Imperial Engine chamber. All the entrances have been sealed!\nWRATH LEADER: You are authorised to use all force necessary. Burn your way in if you have to!\nWRATH LEADER: (FX: RADIO SWITCHED OFF AS ANOTHER IDENTICALLY-VOICED WRATH IN THE CONTROL ROOM SPEAKS: )\nWRATH ONE: The stellar ammonite is continuing to approach the Shadow Heart, Wrath Leader.\nWRATH LEADER: Maintain observation. Prepare to obliterate it the moment power to our laser cannons is restored.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 153\nDOCTOR: Alright, Kylo, you’re plugged in and ready to take command. No second thoughts?\nKYLO: None. Remember, Doctor. If you have attempted any subterfuge, both you and the woman Salvatori will be killed. Transfer control of the Imperial Engine to me.\nDOCTOR: Alright. But I should warn you. It may sting a little.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MACHINE THROBS WITH POWER, RISING IN INTENSITY, WITH AN ELECTRONIC SCREECHING LIKE AN OLD COMPUTER GAME LOADING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WRATH ALL START MOANING, AS SAME ELECTRONIC\nSCREECHING: FILLS THE AIR)\nWRATH ONE: What is happening...\nWRATH LEADER: Page 154\nWRATH LEADER: The Imperial Engine. A new mind is taking command! Yes,\nWRATH LEADER: Kylo Sorsha... we hear you.\nSEVERAL: WRATH & WRATH LEADER: You are our master now!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 155\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MACHINE STILL THROBBING WITH POWER, WHICH SETTLES AND THEN SUBSIDES. KYLO’S VOICE TAKES ON A QUALITY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WRATH THAT WAS HERE BEFORE)\nKYLO: Yes. Yes! The Imperial Engine is mine! I can see through\nKYLO: the eyes of every Wrath! Control every mind!\nVIENNA: I can’t believe you helped him, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t have any choice.\nKYLO: No, Doctor. You did. And now the galaxy is mine, thanks to you.\nDOCTOR: Don’t mention it.\nKYLO: And your assistance is no longer required.\nVIENNA: He’s opening the doors, letting the Wrath in!\nKYLO: There is nowhere left for you to run.\nKYLO: & WRATH: The only escape for you is death!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I suppose you’re right. Oh well, then. Goodbye!\nVIENNA: Doctor! Doctor! Wake up!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 156\nVIENNA: No pulse. No pulse! He’s dead! The Doctor’s dead!\nKYLO: He has stopped his own hearts. He would rather die than face my revenge. One final act of cowardice!\nVIENNA: No!\nKYLO: Leaving just... you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 157\nHORVAL: Talbar! The tracking bug in the Doctor. It’s not\nHORVAL: registering any more.\nTALBAR: Are you sure?\nHORVAL: Of course I’m sure.\nTALBAR: Then we know what to do.\nTALBAR: Captain Webster, the Doctor has given the signal.\nWEBSTER: (VIA RADIO) Very good. Miss Dervish, ignite all engines! Maximum power!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 158\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader! Sensors detect energy signs in the trail of\nWRATH ONE: the stellar ammonite!\nWRATH LEADER: Visual display!\nWRATH ONE: It is an Earth empire war-galleon! It was concealed amongst the wreckage!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris\nKYLO: I shall enjoy this Salvatori.\nVIENNA: No, wait, please, I —\nWRATH: LEADER (VIA MONITOR) Kylo Sorsha. We are under attack.\nKYLO: What?\nKYLO: Page 159\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 160\nDERVISH: The Wrath energy barrier is inactive, sir.\nWEBSTER: It seems the Doctor has succeeded. Put us on a course towards the Shadow Heart, Miss Dervish.\nDERVISH: Proceeding towards the Shadow Heart, sir!\nWEBSTER: Prepare to fire bow blasters.\nDERVISH: At what sir?\nWEBSTER: That large building, there, the one with all the spires.\nDERVISH: Energising bow blasters. Locking on target...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 161\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR) The Earth vessel is preparing to fire upon the Imperial Fortress!\nKYLO: They must be destroyed. I shall restore power.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR) Power to laser cannons restored.\nKYLO: Lock on target. Prepare to fire at my command!\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Kylo.\nVIENNA: Doctor, you’re not dead!\nDOCTOR: No. Merely pining for the fjords!\nVIENNA: But... but— I took your pulse!\nDOCTOR: I put myself into a state of suspended animation. It’s a little gift we Time Lords have. They teach it in schools, as a means of surviving in a vacuum.\nKYLO: Doctor, you will wish you had remained dead. Instead, you can watch as the Trafalgar is destroyed and your friends are obliterated.\nDOCTOR: I really don’t think you want to do that.\nKYLO: (LAUGHING) You dare to threaten me? When I have the power of life and death over you?\nDOCTOR: No. I’m trying to stop you making a terrible mistake.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 162\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA MONITOR) Kylo Sorsha. We are receiving a communication from the Earth vessel.\nKYLO: They wish to beg for mercy, no doubt. Show me.\nWEBSTER: (VIA MONITOR) This is the HMS Trafalgar calling. Ah, there you are. You\nWEBSTER: must be Kylo Sorsha. And the Doctor and Miss Salvatori!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 163\nKYLO: (VIA MONITOR) I have taken control of the Imperial Engine. I am now the Emperor of the Wrath!\nWEBSTER: I see that. You have my sincerest condolences.\nKYLO: (VIA MONITOR) You will be destroyed!\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Before you do that, we have something to show you. Ready, Jandor?\nJANDOR: Ready. I’m so sorry to see what’s become of you, Kylo.\nJANDOR: (FX: SHE REMOVES THE MASK — AND IT’S ALIONA, WITH NO\nVOICE: EFFECT. SHE’LL BE CALLED ALIONA FROM NOW ON)\nALIONA: So, so sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 164\nKYLO: Aliona. Aliona, my love. I thought you were dead.\nALIONA: (VIA MONITOR) No, my lord. As you can see, I still live.\nKYLO: No, no, where has she gone?\nDOCTOR: So, Kylo, what’s it to be? Are you still going to destroy the Trafalgar?\nKYLO: This is some trick. Some deception on the Doctor’s part!\nDOCTOR: I simply wanted to remind you of what’s really important. And give you a choice. You can still be the Emperor of the Wrath and rule over the galaxy, but only if you’re prepared to murder the woman you love. Or -\nKYLO: Or... I let the Trafalgar destroy this fortress, and the Wrath empire.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s entirely up to you!\nKYLO: But I saw Aliona die. Her escape capsule was destroyed before my eyes!\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, well, I can explain about that...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 165\nDOCTOR WHO: ROOM/ CATACOMBS.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) You see, after I left the Trafalgar, I didn’t travel directly to the Wrath spaceship.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Captain Webster. If you’ll excuse me, but a Doctor’s got to do what a Doctor’s go to do...\nWEBSTER: (VIA TANNOY) What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: See you earlier!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR ENTERS TARDIS. WE GO WITH HIM, DOORS CLOSE, HE PRESSES BUTTONS UNDER THE FOLLOWING)\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) Instead, I travelled to the tunnels beneath your palace, when the Wrath were about to land.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) Once there, I made my way to the escape capsule...\nALIONA: Doctor! What are you doing here? The Wrath will be here soon. My Lord has given me orders to leave.\nDOCTOR: Yes, in this capsule, which he’s prepared just for such an eventuality. Almost as if he was expecting the Wrath £0. Calls.\nALIONA: What do you want? To escape in the capsule with me? Or to take my place?\nDOCTOR: Neither. I wouldn’t recommend you use it. I’ve removed its force-shield generator. The moment it takes off, the Wrath will detect it and destroy it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 166\nKYLO: You, Doctor! You deliberately sabotaged the capsule, to\nKYLO: make me think Aliona was dead? Why?\nDOCTOR: I was just about to tell you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 167\nALIONA: Why have you done this? To condemn me to death?\nDOCTOR: No. I want to show you something. It won’t take long.\nDOCTOR: After the escape capsule launched, I thought I’d give Aliona a quick tour of the catacombs...\nALIONA: Why have you brought me here?\nDOCTOR: Have you been here before?\nALIONA: No, my Lord Kylo has forbidden it.\nDOCTOR: And have you never thought to wonder why? Look at the names on the sarcophagi.\nALIONA: Aliona fifty-one. Aliona fifty-two. Aliona fifty-three...\nDOCTOR: They’re all you. Or rather, you previous clones.\nALIONA: My previous clones?\nDOCTOR: You’re the latest in a long line of Alionas. All created by Kylo using DNA from the Royal Carcanet.\nALIONA: You say that Kylo... created me?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I don’t think you’re more than a few months old.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 168\nALIONA: But I remember growing up on Gadarel Prime.\nDOCTOR: False memories implanted into your brain. None of that really happened. The real Aliona died many decades ago.\nALIONA: The “real” Aliona... then what am I?\nDOCTOR: A plaything. A toy. Made by Kylo’s for his amusement.\nALIONA: No. My lord Kylo would not do this. He loves me. And I love him with all my heart.\nDOCTOR: No. You’ve been conditioned to think you do. You never had any choice in the matter.\nALIONA: All these other Alionas, they felt they loved Kylo too?\nDOCTOR: With all their hearts.\nALIONA: But why are there so many? Why, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Because the process is unstable. Each clone’s lifetime is shorter than the one before.\nALIONA: So this is the life Kylo has created for me. For the woman he claims to love.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 169\nKYLO: You turned her against me, Doctor. You turned her against\nKYLO: me!\nDOCTOR: No. All I did was tell her the truth.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 170\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) As the Wrath searched the tunnels, we returned to the TARDIS...\nALIONA: This is not a travel capsule.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s a time machine.\nALIONA: A time-machine?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And now I need to ask you for your help.\nALIONA: To do what?\nDOCTOR: To save millions of lives. And to save your Lord Kylo.\nALIONA: What must I do?\nDOCTOR: First, I need you to wear this.\nALIONA: What is it?\nDOCTOR: It’s a survival suit I picked up on the planet Galbar. The filtration mask will cover your face.\nALIONA: Why must I cover my face?\nDOCTOR: Because no-one must know who you are. You are not remove that mask for anyone until I give you the word.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 171\nALIONA: If you insist.\nDOCTOR: And from now on, your name is Jandor.\nALIONA: Jandor.\nDOCTOR: Right. Let’s go.\nALIONA: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: The control cabin of a stellar ammonite called Hercules.\nWRATH LEADER: (VIA TANNOY) Citizens of Temperance. Do not panic. Repeat. Do not panic, etc.\nDOCTOR: Now, while I attach this force-shield generator I stole from the escape pod, I need you to run a little errand.\nALIONA: What do you wish me to do?\nDOCTOR: I need you to pop to Starbaff’s bar and rescue me from a bounty hunter called Vienna Salvatori. But first, mask on, don’t forget. Strict instructions!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 172\nKYLO: You arranged all this. Just to place Aliona on board that ship.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m afraid I’ve always been one step ahead. But you see, I’ve known you ever since you were a young man. I know you better than you know yourself. (BEAT) So, are you going to destroy the Trafalgar, or aren’t you?\nKYLO: You are asking me to sacrifice my life for the woman I love. There can be no question.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris\nDERVISH: Incoming communication, sir.\nWEBSTER: Put it on the overhead scanner.\nKYLO: (VIA MONITOR) Aliona. My love.\nALIONA: My Lord Kylo.\nALIONA: Page 173\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 174\nKYLO: I did it all for you, you know.\nALIONA: (VIA MONITOR) You must leave the fortress. Before Captain Webster destroys it.\nKYLO: No. I am a part of the Imperial Engine now, I cannot leave.\nALIONA: (VIA MONITOR) But you must. You must!\nKYLO: Captain Webster. I have deactivated all defences. You are free to fire.\nALIONA: (VIA MONITOR) Kylo!\nKYLO: Goodbye, my love.\nVIENNA: We’re going to die. He’s just condemned us to death!\nKYLO: No. You may leave. The Wrath will not stop you.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Kylo Sorsha.\nKYLO: Thank you, Doctor. For giving me something to live for. And to die for.\nVIENNA: Come on. Let’s get out of here.\nDOCTOR: Goodnight, sweet prince!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR AND VIENNA LEAVE. WE HEAR THE VOICES OF THOSE\nPLUGGED: INTO THE ENGINE WHISPERING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 175\nKYLO: Do not fear, my brothers. Do not fear. The end is not far away.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris\nWEBSTER: Ready to fire, Miss Dervish?\nDERVISH: Bow blasters energised and locked.\nWEBSTER: Then in your own time, Miss Dervish.\nDERVISH: Firing bow blasters!\nDERVISH: Page 176\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 177\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE SOUND OF THE TRAFALGAR ROARING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE, FIRING ITS BLASTERS REPEATEDLY — HITTING THE FORTRESS, CAUSING IT TO EXPLODE MASSIVELY )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 178\nWRATH ONE: Wrath leader! The Earth vessel is firing upon the Imperial Fortress.\nWRATH LEADER: We have our instructions. The moment of judgement has arrived. It is time for the Wrath to die.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 179\nVIENNA: They’ve started a chain reaction. First the fortress,\nVIENNA: then the rest of the planet!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Kylo’s work, I think.\nVIENNA: Doctor, where are we going? We can’t drive a Wrath ship, we’re stuck here.\nDOCTOR: Not quite. If I’m right —\nDOCTOR: Yes, there she is, safe and sound.\nVIENNA: Your travel capsule!\nDOCTOR: Fancy a lift?\nVIENNA: (INSIDE) Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: (INSIDE) Does it matter?\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS DOOR CLOSED, IT TAKES OFF. ANOTHER EXPLOSION THEN RIPS THROUGH THE SHIP, DESTROYING EVERYTHING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 180\nDERVISH: Shadow Heart totally destroyed, sir.\nWEBSTER: Very good. Pass on my congratulations to the crew.\nDERVISH: Aye aye, sir.\nDERVISH: Unauthorised materialisation on the bridge, sir.\nDOCTOR: Captain Webster!\nWEBSTER: Doctor. And I see you’ve brought Miss Salvatori with you.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I suggest you clap her in irons while you have the chance!\nVIENNA: What?\nWEBSTER: Miss Dervish, if you could conduct Miss Salvatori to the brig.\nDERVISH: A pleasure, sir. Miss?\nVIENNA: Doctor. You’d better hope we never meet again, because if we do, it’ll be the last thing you ever know.\nDOCTOR: What can I say, but... goodnight, Vienna? Take her away,\nDOCTOR: Lieutenant. And try not to let her escape this time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 181\nDOCTOR: Hercules! So good to see you back in the pink. And the grey. And the... orange.\nTALBAR: Doctor. You’re leaving?\nHORVAL: I see they’ve brought your travel capsule down here.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Captain Webster was getting a bit aggravated about it cluttering up his bridge.\nHORVAL: Still can’t believe you had it all planned out in advance, Aliona being on the Trafalgar and all that.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, that might be how it looked to you, but from my perspective, I’m just making it up as I go along. So what’s next for Talbar and Horval?\nTALBAR: We’ve got a whole world of scrap metal to collect.\nHORVAL: Yeah. The Shadow Heart was almost solid Galdrium.\nTALBAR: And Herc here’s raring to start gathering it, aren’t you, old thing?\nDOCTOR: Good luck. I think you might need it.\nTALBAR: Why?\nDOCTOR: Well, no war on the horizon, a sudden flood of Galdrium coming onto the market, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s practically worthless!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 182\nHORVAL: What? What did he say?\nTALBAR: I think we’ve been stitched up. Stitched up like a creeper! Oh, let’s get out of this place...\nTALBAR: (FX: THEY CLIMB THROUGH HERCULES HATCHWAY. IT CLOSES. NEARBY, THE DOCTOR APPROACHES ALIONA)\nALIONA: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Aliona. I thought I might find you here.\nALIONA: I knew you would head for your ship.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry it had to end like this.\nALIONA: I did love him, you know. Even if it was just the conditioning, I’ve never known anything else.\nDOCTOR: I know. But he didn’t die in vain. He died to save you, and a million others besides. (BEAT) What happens now?\nALIONA: I have not yet decided. It’s hard to know what to do without him. I thought I might return to Gadarel Prime. I have seen it so often in my memories. I would like to know if they are true. Doctor... How long have I got left?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. But do any of us? All we can do is try to make every moment count. I think he realised that in the end.\nALIONA: (INCREASINGLY DETERMINED) Yes. Then I shall. He gave his life for me. I should do no less in return. I am the last living representative of the Drashani Empire, Doctor. They shall not fade away into the night. I shall walk far and wide and tell of their glory. Keep them alive in memory if not in life. What better way is there to honour Kylo’s memory?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHADOW HEART — by Jonathan Morris Page 183\nDOCTOR: I can think of nothing finer.\nALIONA: My people shall never die.\nDOCTOR: No. Goodbye, Aliona.\nALIONA: Goodbye Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Happy travellings.\nALIONA: For Kylo.\nALIONA: (FX: SHE WALKS OFF AS IN THE BACKGROUND HERCULES ROARS\nHAPPILY: ONE LAST TIME)\nHAPPILY: END OF EPISODE FOUR"
