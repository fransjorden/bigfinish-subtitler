Wouldn’t get very far without that.\nPERCY: No, you wouldn’t.\nJOANNA: Woah, somebody got up on the wrong side of bed.\nANDY: How would you like to be stuck out in this weather?\nJOANNA: Not much. But that seems to be the plan for the next week.\nANDY: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Well, this is gonna be a laugh a minute.\nJOANNA: And what was all that about me being your wife?\nANDY: You know what these country folks are like, he might not approve.\nJOANNA: What? He’d turn us away for being an unmarried couple daring to share the same caravan? What is this, the middle ages?\nANDY: (TO HIMSELF) Middle of nowhere, next best thing...\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 6\nANDY: JOANNA AND ANDY CLAMBER IN.

And then we can go for a walk, get some fresh country air.\nJOANNA: And pneumonia too, while we’re at it. It’s nearly sunset.\nPERCY: Making yourselves at home?\nANDY: Yeah, something like that. Come in, mate.\nPERCY: I see you’ve found the heater.

(MUTTERS) I knew it. Middle bloomin’ ages!\nPERCY: That’s also where you’1ll find the fresh water tap. There’s a pay-telephone by the main gate. If you need me, my caravan’s the one beside it.\nANDY: That’s very helpful of you. Mister - ?\nPERCY: Percy Till. I’m the site manager. There is one more thing.\nJOANNA: Yeah?\nPERCY: A little rule. The use of radios, cassette recorders and portable televisions is strictly forbidden.\nANDY: What? Why?\nPERCY: It disturbs the other guests. (BEAT) You haven’t brought any such devices with you?\nANDY: No, no, of course not.\nPERCY: Good. Well, that will be everything.

This isn’t my wedding.\nCONSTANCE: And this isn’t 1944. Doctor. You said you were taking me home.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m sorry about that, I’ll get you there eventually. But something came up.\nFLIP: Here we go. Brace yourself for a load of space jargon, Connie.\nDOCTOR: Well, just for that. I was going to offer you both the shelter of my umbrella, but now I’m not so sure —\nFLIP: Come on, budge up, I’m getting soaked out here.\nDOCTOR: (BUDGES UP) Alright. The reason we’re here, ladies, is because the TARDIS detected some temporal interference.\nCONSTANCE: “Temporal interference”?\nDOCTOR: A disturbance in the fabric of the space-time continuum.\nCONSTANCE: And I would be right to infer that’s a bad thing?\nDOCTOR: You would be very right indeed. Prolonged exposure can have all\nDOCTOR: sorts of... nasty side-effects.\nFLIP: And it’s here? In this caravan site?\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: Hereabouts. The temporal disturbance is diffuse. It’s somewhere in this general area. Shouldn’t be too hard to find!\nFLIP: Well that’s not vague.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. We have company.\nDOCTOR: What? (SEES PERCY) Oh?\nPERCY: (APPROACHING) It’s the Doctor, isn’t it? Doctor! After all this time. How\nPERCY: good to see you again!\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nANDY: You were wrong, we’re not the only ones here.\nJOANNA: No car, though. And that blue box. Was that there before? I don’t remember seeing it on the way in —\nANDY: Keep an eye out, will you?\nJOANNA: An eye out for what?\nANDY: Wouldn’t want old Percy clocking this, would we?\nJOANNA: You brought the portable?!\nANDY: Well, you don’t expect me to miss the match, do you? (FX: HE\nSLAMS: BOOT SHUT AND PICKS UP TELLY) And now you don’t have to miss Emmerdale Farm. Out the way.\nJOANNA: Haven’t you forgotten something? No electricity.\nANDY: No problem. We can run it off the car batteries. Even brought the wires, just in case. (HE PUTS DOWN TELLY) Look, while I’m setting this up, get the suitcases, could you, “Mrs Clover”?\nJOANNA: (JUMPS OVER PUDDLE, YUK!) Mrs Clover? In your dreams!\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nPERCY: I’1ll put you in caravan two.\nFLIP: We’ve pre-booked, have we?\nPERCY: In a manner of speaking. The Doctor was expected.\nDOCTOR: I was? Expected by whom?\nPERCY: By me, sir. I - (HE’S DISCONCERTED BY CONSTANCE)\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry, would you mind not looking at me like that?\nPERCY: My apologies. Sometimes I.. forget myself.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid you have me at a disadvantage... (FX: TAKES DOWN UMBRELLA) You wouldn’t care to remind me of your name?\nPERCY: Till. Percy Till. You don’t remember me?\nDOCTOR: I meet an awful lot of people, it’s no reflection on you. But you remember me, Percy...\nPERCY: Well, I’m hardly gonna forget you, am I, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No, I suppose I am what you would call memorable!\nPERCY: And you haven’t changed a bit, while I.. well, I’m an old man now, no wonder you wouldn’t recognise me.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. But you don’t know my, ah, travelling companions — Philippa Jackson, and Constance Clarke?\nPERCY: No, I have not had the pleasure. Why, should I?\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR: No, just.. narrowing things down.\nPERCY: If you’1l follow me, I’11 show you to your caravan.\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind of you, Percy. Lead on!\nCONSTANCE: (TO FLIP, NOT WHISPERING BUT CLOSE) “Narrowing things down”?\nFLIP: The Doctor’s trying to work out whether the old guy is someone he hasn’t met yet, or someone he has met and forgotten.\nDOCTOR: Because if I haven’t met him yet, then I have to avoid asking too many questions about events in my own future.\nPERCY: (FROM UP AHEAD) It’s a good thing you arrived when you did. It’1ll be getting dark soon, and night falls quickly in these parts...\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nCROSS TO: INTERFERENCE AND HISSING STATIC.\nJOANNA: He’s taking them into the caravan opposite.\nANDY: You’re turning into a right little curtain-twitcher.\nJOANNA: Nothing else to do until you get that thing working.\nANDY: It is working, it’s just.. (FX: BANGS IT) Stupid thing.\nJOANNA: Well, that’s not gonna help.\nANDY: There’s no reception. Same as the car radio.\nJOANNA: After all that!\nANDY: Hills must be in the way...\nJOANNA: Turn it down!\nANDY: Alright, keep your hair on.\nJOANNA: Makes you wonder what the point of Percy’s ‘little rule’ is, if you can’t even pick up anything.\nANDY: Fine. So what do we do now?\nJOANNA: I thought the whole point of this trip was for us to spend some time together. To “work things out”. So. Let’s talk.\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nFLIP: Woah, it’s even smaller on the inside.\nCONSTANCE: There’s a bedroom at the end, that’s for Philippa and I?\nPERCY: I assume that is the arrangement. There’s also a drop-down bed in the front for the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Well, this is quite the home from home. All mod- cons!\nFLIP: Where’s the telly?\nPERCY: I’m afraid that the use of radios, cassette recorders and portable televisions is strictly forbidden.\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR: - and quite right too! We didn’t come all this way to sit in front of the goggle-box, did we, Flip?\nFLIP: (CHEEKY) I don’t know, depends what’s on.\nDOCTOR: No, we came to see the sights. Percy, are there any local points of interest you would particularly recommend?\nPERCY: There’s a leaflet on the table. Well, I’1ll leave you to get settled in. If you need me, I’m in the caravan by the gate.\nDOCTOR: Now, this is interesting. There’s a stone circle not half a mile from here. According to this, the ancient Britons used it for human sacrifice.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nCONSTANCE: Something to do with the ‘time fissure’?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. They may well have attributed temporal anomalies to some sort of deity. And there are the remains of a ruined monastery not far away too...\nFLIP: (SARCASTIC) Wow. It’s like Disneyland.\nDOCTOR: Apparently that’s how this area got its name. Abbey Marston.\nCONSTANCE: Abbey Marston? Did you say Abbey Marston?\nDOCTOR: You’ve heard of it?\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure. I would need to look at a map.\nDOCTOR: There’s a drawing on the back, but it’s not much help —\nCONSTANCE: No, I mean a detailed Ordnance Survey map, of the whole area.\nFLIP: We could ask around the other caravans. (FX: GETS UP) Well, anything beats sitting around here!\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nANDY: She got out of her depth. By the time I got to her, she'd already gone under three times. No-one could’ve saved her.\nJOANNA: Andy. I don’t want to talk about this.\nANDY: That’s just it. We never talk about it. And ever since, we've been like... this place! Stuck, not going anywhere! You won’t even let me touch you. It’s like you’re punishing me.\nJOANNA: I’m not punishing you. The doctor said it would take time, to come to terms with it.\nANDY: It’s been a year. A year of you hating me.\nJOANNA: I don’t hate you, I don’t blame you. It’s not about you.\nANDY: Then what is it about?\nJOANNA: It’s about me. Cos I was too busy reading a stupid book to notice until it was too late. If I’d looked up just ten seconds earlier, maybe she would still be alive. She was drowning fifty yards away from me and I didn’t even hear her calling for help. My own sister, and I didn’t hear her.\nANDY: Jo. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. I just thought it might help to talk about her. (FX: HE UNZIPS A BAG) To actually take some time, to remember her.\nJOANNA: What?\nANDY: Rather than burying it all away. So, anyway, I brought some photos. Of Susannah.\nJOANNA: I can’t believe this.\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nANDY: So we can remember what she was like when she was alive.\nJOANNA: Hang on, some of these are from the holiday. From the day she\nJOANNA: died...\nANDY: I know, I had the film in my camera for ages.\nJOANNA: Put them away.\nANDY: What?\nJOANNA: I don’t want to look at them, put them away!\nANDY: Alright, alright. (FX: SCOOPS UP PHOTOS INTO ENVELOPE)\nJOANNA: Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me?\nANDY: I just thought —\nJOANNA: You just thought? You didn’t think, that’s your trouble. If you did, you’d know, they’re the last thing I want to see...\nANDY: I’m sorry.\nJOANNA: I’m going outside.\nANDY: But where —\nJOANNA: I don’t know. I just need to be somewhere you’re not!\nANDY: Suit yourself. Can’t do right for doing wrong around here.\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nANDY: Now, let’s see if I can get this thing to work...\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nFLIP: Hello? Hello?\nJOANNA: Yeah, what?\nFLIP: Sorry to disturb you and all that, we just need\nJOANNA: You’ve just arrived, haven’t you? You’re in the\nFLIP: That’s right, yeah.

(FX: GLOVE COMPARTMENT OPENS, MAP OUT) Here you go.\nFLIP: Cheers, won’t be a tic.\nJOANNA: (GETTING OUT) No, don’t worry about it, you can keep it!\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nFLIP: (CALLS AFTER HER) Hey, wait, are you alright? (TO DOCTOR) Leave this with me.\nFLIP: (RUNNING OFF) Hey! Wait! (NEARLY FALLS OVER) Wait!\nDOCTOR: That girl has to be the most impetuous, irresponsible -\nCONSTANCE: She sees someone upset, she can’t help getting involved. Just like someone else I could mention.\nDOCTOR: Point taken. So, Constance, what exactly are we looking for?\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nANDY: Come on, come on.. Where are you, I know you’re out there...\nANDY: BUT SLOWLY GROWING CLEARER. AS SPOOKY AS POSSIBLE!\nSUSANNAH: (FX: STATIC) Help me... help me, please... help me... help me, please... somebody help me...\nANDY: (OVER THIS) (THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED) There you are. I knew it!\nMAXIMUM: VOLUME IN BOTH CHANNELS FOR HALF A SECOND.\nTHEN SHARP CUT TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nJOANNA: Oh, what?\nFLIP: No luck?\nJOANNA: No dial tone. Even if I had the number of a taxi firm, they probably wouldn’t come out here.\nFLIP: You’re trying to leave?\nJOANNA: Since when was it any of your business?\nFLIP: Sorry, I’1ll go.\nJOANNA: No, it’s not you. It’s... boyfriend trouble. Well, fiancée trouble, technically.\nFLIP: Oh, I’ve been there.\nJOANNA: You’ve been where?\nFLIP: I mean, tell me about it. If you want.\nJOANNA: It was all his idea. Andy’s. That we should go away to ‘work things out’. My sister died last year, you see —\nFLIP: I’m sorry.\nJOANNA: Thanks. Anyway, Andy thinks the best way of helping me ‘come terms’ with it is to sit around and talk about her. He even brought along a bunch of photos.\nJOANNA: to\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nFLIP: What an idiot.\nJOANNA: Exactly. What an idiot, right?\nFLIP: But he was trying to help, though.\nJOANNA: What?\nFLIP: I mean, in his own stupid way. You know, a lot of blokes would just walk away. Too difficult.\nJOANNA: I suppose I haven’t been the easiest person to get along with.\nFLIP: And he’s put up with you.\nJOANNA: (SMILES) Not half as much as I’ve put up with him.\nFLIP: Well, that’s always how it works. (SEES PERCY) Woah, someone’s not happy.\nPERCY: Did you just make a phone call?\nJOANNA: I’m sorry, what?\nPERCY: Did you just make a phone call?\nJOANNA: Well, no, cos the line’s dead, isn’t it? Some campsite you’re running here. Even the phone doesn’t work!\nPERCY: The phone works. We’ve been cut off.\nFLIP: Eh?\nPERCY: The stupid idiot... he doesn’t know what he’s doing...\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nJOANNA: Some people!\nFLIP: Yeah, touchy, much! (SHIVERS) Shall we get back, only I’m freezing my bits off out here.\nJOANNA: Yeah, it — (SEES SOMETHING) Woah, where did that come from?\nFLIP: What?\nJOANNA: The mist, look at it.. it’s like a wall of fog...\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: So, let’s see. The circle’s here, the monastery’s here, and the village of Abbey Marston... but the rest is just fields and woods.\nCONSTANCE: Not quite. (FX: FINGER ON MAP) There! I was right. I knew I'd heard the name before!\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure what I’m supposed to be looking at.\nCONSTANCE: A road that leads to nowhere? This whole area has been deliberately left blank.\nDOCTOR: Something has been kept off the map?\nCONSTANCE: Yes. Abbey Marston Manor.\nDOCTOR: A house?\nCONSTANCE: An R.A.F. research station.\nDOCTOR: Researching what?\nCONSTANCE: Some sort of top-secret project. So top-secret nobody was supposed to know the place even existed. I only found out by accident.\nDOCTOR: And it’s still being kept secret, forty years later...\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nFLIP: You’re sure you'll be alright?\nJOANNA: Yeah. Thanks. I’ll see you around.\nJOANNA: Andy? Andy?\nANDY: In here.\nANDY: You alright?\nJOANNA: Not really, no. It’s brass monkeys out there.\nANDY: Sit over here, soon warm you up.\nJOANNA: You’re not still trying to get a picture on that thing, you?\nANDY: No. But I have managed to get something.\nJOANNA: What?\nANDY: A.. Signal. But I don’t want you to freak out or panic.\nJOANNA: What, like CB? Or police radio?\nANDY: Something like that. But you have to promise me, you’re gonna run off again.\nANDY: are\nANDY: not\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nJOANNA: I’m not promising anything, just show me whatever it is.\nANDY: Okay.\nJOANNA: What? A grey fuzz?\nANDY: Just listen.\nJOANNA: (LAUGHS) What am I supposed to hear?\nANDY: Shhh. Listen.\nJOANNA: What?

Why are you doing this?\nANDY: I’m not doing anything.\nJOANNA: You've set up a tape recorder, this is all some sick joke for you,, isn’t: 1?\nANDY: No. It’s not me. It’s her. It’s really her. It’s Susannah.\nSUSANNAH: Help me... Please... (CRIES OUT WITH A SCREAM) Joanna!\nJOANNA: No. Stop its. Turn it. off! Turn it off! Turn 1t -off!\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nCONSTANCE: This fog.. I’ve never seen anything like it, not even in London before the war.\nDOCTOR: Yes.

There you are!\nFLIP: (STOPS RUNNING) Were you looking for me?\nCONSTANCE: Actually, we were on our way to return the map -\nJOANNA: (FROM INSIDE CARAVAN)\nCONSTANCE: What was that?\nFLIP: That was Joanna.\nDOCTOR: Flip, Constance. Go back to our caravan.\nFLIP: What? No.\nDOCTOR: Please, for once, do as I say!\nCONSTANCE: What — but —\nDOCTOR: Don’t argue. Go!\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nANDY: Hey, what do you want?\nDOCTOR: I heard a scream.\nANDY: Oh, did you? So what?\nDOCTOR: It’s Joanna, isn’t it? What happened?\nJOANNA: It’s him. He was playing some trick.\nDOCTOR: Trick?\nJOANNA: He set up the telly to make my sister’s voice come out of it.\nDOCTOR: Your sister?\nJOANNA: She died, about a year ago.\nDOCTOR: And her voice came through the television set?\nANDY: Yeah, I was just trying to get a signal, and I could hear her, calling out. Not that it’s anything to do with you.\nDOCTOR: Well, it doesn’t appear to have been tampered with.\nANDY: It’s not a trick. Why would I do something like that?\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: But if it’s not... which channel were you tuned to?\nANDY: I don’t know. I wasn’t tuned to any channel. It was just static, interference.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Television static isn’t just static.\nJOANNA: No?\nDOCTOR: No. It is the sound of the birth of the universe.\nANDY: What?\nDOCTOR: Cosmic noise. The afterglow of the Big Bang. And if what you\nDOCTOR: heard really was your sister, calling from beyond the grave...\nJOANNA: A ghost? What we heard was a ghost?\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s only one way to find out.\nANDY: Jo, do you want to go in the other room?\nJOANNA: No, I’m staying. If it’s her.. I’m staying.\nDOCTOR: Shhh.\nDOCTOR: JOANNA/ANDY : (SHRIEK OF ALARM)/Hey, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Percy, please — just put the axe down —\nDOCTOR: IS DISCONNECTED.\nDOCTOR: IT\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nANDY: Hey!!\nPERCY: I told you.

We must’ve wandered into the woods.\nFLIP: It’s not a problem. We just keep going, eventually we’1ll get somewhere. At least we can still see.\nCONSTANCE: Yes. That’s odd. It’s still... twilight.\nFLIP: What?\nCONSTANCE: It should’ve got dark by now, but it hasn’t. It’s just mist in every direction. Like it’s closing in on us...\nFLIP: Well, we just have to keep going until we’re out the other side.\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nANDY: It’s gonna be a hell of a job, driving back through this...\nJOANNA: Better than staying here and getting killed.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think Percy intends you any harm.\nANDY: I’m not planning on sticking around to find out.\nDOCTOR: But you did break his little rule.\nANDY: So he bursts in with an axe?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you’re in any danger from him. But you’re right about one thing. It’s certainly not safe to stay.\nANDY: What about you, do you and your birds want a lift?\nDOCTOR: My associates and I will not be needing a lift, no. But I should be getting back to them. (FX: PATS CAR ROOF) Drive carefully!\nJOANNA: What do you think he meant, it’s not safe?\nANDY: (FX: DOING UP SEATBELT) Who cares? We’re leaving.\nTURNING: OVER.\nTURNING: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nANDY: Damn, come on —\nJOANNA: Was is it?\nANDY: Battery’s flat.\nJOANNA: What? (REALISES) The telly! You must’ve used up all the power.\nANDY: What? In half an hour? (FX: HE THUMPS STEERING WHEEL)\nJOANNA: Can’t you jump start it?\nANDY: From what? No other cars. (FX: UNDOES SEATBELT) Nothing else for it. We’ll have to get out and push...\nJOANNA: Both of us?\nANDY: Unless you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life!\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nANDY: ON, GROWING LOUDER FROM SILENCE.\nCONSTANCE: Flip, what is it?\nFLIP: I can’t go on.

Then we went for a wander around the old town, did some postcards, then went down to the beach. Jo had her head stuck in her Danielle Steel, so I went for a swim...\nDOCTOR: And after that?\nSUSANNAH: (TRYING TO PIN DOWN MEMORY) I remember, I got tired... and when I tried to touch the bottom, I couldn’t reach and went under...\nJOANNA: Oh no.\nSUSANNAH: Then I came up, and I was calling for help, screaming, but nobody could hear me.

Why not?\nFLIP: I mean, this must be a, I don’t know, a robot or something.\nDOCTOR: No. She’s flesh and blood.\nFLIP: Or a clone, then!\nDOCTOR: I suppose that is better than the alternative.\nCONSTANCE: Which is?

She looked like she had been plucked out of time at the precise instant of her death.\nFLIP: The temporal interference?!\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR: Quite. But if her death has now been averted...\nFLIP: That’s changing history.\nDOCTOR: I think our friend Mr Till knows more than he’s letting on.\nCONSTANCE: You’re not going to see that man again?\nDOCTOR: You disapprove?\nCONSTANCE: I don’t trust him.

They hear stories about this place, rumours, and come to try and bring back their loved ones. But I’ve always stopped them, before.\nDOCTOR: By smashing their radios and television sets?\nPERCY: Because that’s part of it, don’t you see?\nDOCTOR: Because the act of remembering creates a psychic link between the past and the present. The voice that Joanna heard was the link being established...\nPERCY: You know more about it than I do. All I know is that’s there’s something about this place that means the dead don’t stay dead.\nDOCTOR: When you say this place, you mean this caravan site?\nPERCY: No, we're on the very edge of it here. It’s like a circle.\nDOCTOR: Show me on the map.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nPERCY: We’re here. The stone circle’s at the centre, and it’s about half a mile all around.\nDOCTOR: So the affected area includes the abandoned monastery?\nPERCY: That’s why the monks left. It wasn’t the reformation that did for them. It was all their dead buddies turning up after they’d buried them. As soon as they remembered them in their prayers, down came the mist... bringing the dead with it.\nDOCTOR: So, within this perimeter, time is at a standstill. There’s no past or future, only the here and now. The question is, how do we get time moving again?\nPERCY: Ah, well, I can’t tell you that.\nDOCTOR: Can’t? Because you don’t know or because you don’t want to tell me?\nPERCY: Because I’m not allowed to. You’1ll just have to work it out for yourself, won’t you?\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nJOANNA: I still can’t believe she’s alive. Oh my god, mum and dad! They’re gonna be over the moon when they find out.\nANDY: Listen. We’re gonna have to be careful. If this gets out, the press will go bananas.\nJOANNA: So? We can sell our story, make some money.\nANDY: Don’t be stupid. They’1ll say it was a miracle. There’1l be people flocking here to bring back their dead relatives.\nJOANNA: And what’s so bad about that?\nANDY: That can’t happen.\nJOANNA: What, cos you want it to stay as your little secret?\nANDY: No. We just have to keep this quiet. (FX: ANDY GETS UP, MOVES\nTHROUGH: CARAVAN) We’re gonna have to wake her.\nJOANNA: No. Let her sleep.\nANDY: We have to get away from here as soon as possible.\nJOANNA: How? We tried. The car won’t start.\nANDY: We can push it. Or walk to the village, if we have to. But we have to go. Now!\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nFLIP: So you know about this place, what’s it called? Abbey Marston?\nCONSTANCE: Just that there was an R.A.F. station here during the war. I don’t even know if it’s still here.\nFLIP: Maybe we should go and check?\nCONSTANCE: And get ourselves lost again? And besides, the Doctor said we should wait here.\nFLIP: And you always do what the Doctor tells you?\nCONSTANCE: I respect his advice. As should you. (BEAT) Though I wish he wouldn’t keep finding excuses for not taking us home.\nFLIP: You’ve had enough?\nCONSTANCE: It just feels like my whole life is on hold. I’d quite like to resume it. And besides, you have a wedding to go to!\nFLIP: Yeah, don’t remind me. I’m sure the Doctor will get us where we need to be. Eventually. Maybe he finds it hard, saying goodbye.\nFLIP: Ah, speak of the devil.\nDOCTOR: Ladies, you’re probably bored rigid sitting around waiting for\nDOCTOR: me. How do you fancy a little field trip?\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nSUSANNAH: (HALF AWAKE) Wha-?\nANDY: Shush, it’s alright. Jo, open the back, could you?\nJOANNA: Shouldn’t it have got dark by now?\nANDY: Never mind that, just open her up.\nANDY: (PUTS SUSANNAH INSIDE) Right. Now get ready to push.\nPERCY: It won’t work, you know.\nJOANNA: (STARTLED, WHERE THE HELL DID HE SPRING FROM?) What?\nPERCY: You can’t leave. Not while you have her with you.\nANDY: Oh really. And who’s gonna stop us? You?\nPERCY: No, not me. The mist.\nANDY: What?\nPERCY: But you don’t have to take my word for it. Please, go ahead and try. See how far you get! (LAUGHS)\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nFLIP: There’s no mist this way?\nDOCTOR: No. I think it only acts as a barrier around the perimeter.\nCONSTANCE: That sense of dread I felt, that was to stop me leaving?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Literally a psychological barrier. Whereas now we are Slap-bang in the centre.\nFLIP: The stone circle?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s safe to assume it was constructed because of the... properties of the area.\nCONSTANCE: People returning from the dead.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps it was used to gather people together in remembrance, to summon those they had lost.\nFLIP: So, this place, it can bring back anyone who has died, just by you thinking about them?\nDOCTOR: As long as the feeling is strong enough.\nFLIP: So that’s why Andy brought all those photos of Susannah.\nDOCTOR: To intensify Joanna’s sense of loss, yes.\nFLIP: What a git!\nCONSTANCE: But this stone circle isn’t causing this “effect”?\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR: No. The source must be underground and ancient. Buried in the Earth since before the dawn of mankind...\nFLIP: Buried? By who?\nDOCTOR: Impossible to tell. A relic of a long-forgotten war? Or a gift to help foster humanity? Either way, these stones are probably just a marker.\nFLIP: And they are? Just stones?\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY MOCKING HER) As far as one can tell.\nFLIP: But you said it was used for human sacrifice.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That was the leaflet, not me.\nCONSTANCE: I think the idea of the Celts practising human sacrifice was just a myth put about the Romans, to justify wiping them out.\nFLIP: (SHE SITS) So what were these two big rocks used for?\nCONSTANCE: Ah. They probably did practice animal sacrifice.\nFLIP: Ugh. You mean these are basically two big butcher’s slabs?\nCONSTANCE: Well, sacrificial altars. For goats, chicken, wild boar. It’s odd that there are two of them, though.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’d think that one would be enough...\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nANDY: (OUTSIDE DOOR) Jo! It’s me.\nJOANNA: Well? Can we leave?\nANDY: (ENTERING)\nANDY: No. It’s no good. I tried, but it was like the old man said. As soon as I walked into the mist, there was this feeling pushing me back. It’s hard to describe. It was like every step was bringing me closer to death. It was like... I could hear them, whispering to me. The dead!\nJOANNA: So we’re stuck here.\nSUSANNAH: (WAKING) What — what did you say?\nJOANNA: It doesn’t matter. Go back to sleep.\nSUSANNAH: No, you said something. About us being stuck here.\nANDY: That’s right. None of us can leave. Not while you’re here.\nJOANNA: Andy, why didn’t you think about this before?\nANDY: Because I didn’t know!\nJOANNA: Oh, I’m sorry. I thought you’d got it all worked out!\nSUSANNAH: Stop it! Please! Both of you. (BEAT) Andy. You mean I can never leave here? I can never go back home and see mum and dad again?\nANDY: That’s what it looks like, yes.\nSUSANNAH: Can I talk to them, on the telephone?\nSUSANNAH: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nANDY: I tried the phone again on the way back. It’s dead.\nJOANNA: It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that you’re here, you’re alive again.\nSUSANNAH: But what’s the point if I can never go anywhere? Why did you have to bring me back? I was dead. Why did you have to bring me back?\nSUSANNAH: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nSUSANNAH: AND CREAKING IN THE BREEZE.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS OUT) Well, I think it’s safe to say this station is no longer active.\nCONSTANCE: That’s something of an understatement. There’s no roof, what’s left is falling to bits. It looks like a bomb hit it.\nDOCTOR: Maybe it did. Even the best-kept secrets can be discovered.\nCONSTANCE: But it’s still being left off the maps. Which means they’re still trying to keep it quiet. Unless there is something here that poses a threat. Radiation? Or chemical waste?\nDOCTOR: Well, it can’t be that bad, or we wouldn’t still be breathing.\nCONSTANCE: (SARCASTIC) That’s very reassuring.\nDOCTOR: Plus, look! Birds’ nests. Swallows. They’ve been coming back\nDOCTOR: here year after year, raising their young.\nCONSTANCE: But they’re not here now. (BEAT) It’s so quiet.\nDOCTOR: Well, until Flip gets here. Where is she?\nCONSTANCE: I thought she was with you.\nDOCTOR: No. I thought she was with you.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nPERCY: Lost your friends?\nFLIP: Not quite. They were busy looking round some old ruin, I thought I’d leave them to it.\nPERCY: You’ve been to the manor? Didn’t you see the signs?\nFLIP: Yeah, but unfortunately when you or I see a sign saying ‘Danger Keep Out’, the Doctor sees a ‘Welcome’ mat. Why? Is there something there he shouldn’t see?\nPERCY: No. No, there’s nothing there now.\nFLIP: Phone’s ringing.\nPERCY: I won’t be for me.\nFLIP: Why? Doesn’t anyone ever call you?\nPERCY: They used to, but I never answered, and then they stopped calling. No, if the phone’s ringing now, it’s for you. If you know what’s good for you, you won’t answer it.\nFLIP: Why not? (BEAT) Cos it’s someone else that’s dead, isn’t it? Like Susannah. It’ll bring them back. Someone I know that’s dead...\nFLIP: Hello? Hello? (NO REPLY) There’s no-one there. (FX: SHE RETURNS RECEIVER) So, Percy - (SEES HE’S WANDERING OFF) Hey, come back!\nFLIP: (FX: HE SHUTS DOOR OF CARAVAN) Oh, be like that!\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: (CALLS OUT) Philippa!\nCONSTANCE: (APPROACHING) We thought you’d got lost in the mist.\nFLIP: (THINKING ON HER FEET) Yeah, and I ended up back here. You were right about there being no way out.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid there’s a very good reason why we’re cut off from the outside world.\nFLIP: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: There’s something here that allows visitors to rescue the dead from the brink of death. So the only way to prevent a temporal paradox is if they are returned from whence they came.\nFLIP: To die. You mean, they have to die.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Only then will history remain unchanged. And until they are sent back, this place remains... outside time.\nFLIP: But we can still leave, in the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: True. But that won’t do Joanna and Andy any good. Susannah has\nDOCTOR: to be returned to her own timeline, painful as that may be.\nCONSTANCE: And once she goes back, things will return to normal?\nDOCTOR: I think so. The mist will rise, the power will come back on, and Andy and Joanna will be able to drive away.\nFLIP: But we're leaving?\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: I have a feeling that the fact there was an R.A.F. research station here during World War Two was not a coincidence.\nFLIP: But you’re gonna come back, right?\nDOCTOR: Of course. It may be problematic to return instantly, but we should be back within an hour or so.\nFLIP: In that case, I want to stay. (SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHO WAS ON THE\nPHONE: SO THIS A RUSE)\nDOCTOR: What?\nFLIP: You’ll need someone to keep an eye on things here, make sure\nFLIP: nobody tries anything stupid. So I’m volunteering.\nDOCTOR: If you’re sure?\nFLIP: I wouldn’t say it if I wasn’t.\nDOCTOR: Then, thank you. We won’t be long.\nFLIP: You’d better not be.\nCONSTANCE: Good luck.\nFLIP: You too, have fun investigating.\nFLIP: (MOMENT OF APPREHENSIVE GUILT) Sorry, Doctor. Had to be done!\nJOANNA: Where’ve they gone?\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nFLIP: What?\nJOANNA: Don’t act all butter-wouldn’t-melt, I saw them. If your mates can up sticks and pop off, then why can’t we?\nFLIP: It doesn’t work like that...\nJOANNA: Then how does it work like — (FLIP’S NOT PAYING ATTENTION) Hey, look at me when I’m talking to you.\nFLIP: (LOUDER WHISPER) Shhh. It’s Percy. He’s just sneaked out of his caravan.\nJOANNA: (SEES HIM, ALSO LOUD WHISPER) Carrying his axe. Where’s he going?\nFLIP: Into the woods, by the look of it. (SETTING OFF AFTER HIM) Come on!\nJOANNA: You’re not going after him?\nFLIP: Why not? You can stay here if you like, but I want to find out what he’s up to!\nJOANNA: (RELUCTANTLY GOING AFTER FLIP) Fine, let’s both get murdered...\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nJOANNA: DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE GET OUT.\nDOCTOR: Many thanks for the lift!\nCONSTANCE: Yes. Much appreciated!\nHARDWICK: Who are these people, Sergeant?\nWEBSTER: The Doctor and his assistant are here on behalf of S Branch, sir.\nHARDWICK: And you were detailed to give them a lift?\nWEBSTER: No, sir. Their transport broke down on the other side of the woods, they were making their way here when I found them.\nDOCTOR: And very grateful we are too.\nHARDWICK: So you’re one of Professor Lindemann’s boffins, are you?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. My papers.\nHARDWICK: (CHECKING PAPERS) I wasn’t informed of your visit.\nDOCTOR: Nor was I until a few hours ago.\nCONSTANCE: Not going to be a problem, is it?\nHARDWICK: No, these seem to be in order. (HE RETURNS PAPERS) Doctor Lethbridge-Stewart, Leading Wren Clarke. Welcome to Abbey Marston. (FX: STAMP AND SALUTE) Captain Hardwick, at your service.\nHARDWICK: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: So what precisely do you do here? As you might expect, my briefing was.. somewhat cursory.\nHARDWICK: Easiest thing will be for you to see for yourself. You’ve arrived just in time for the evening show!\nHARDWICK: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nFLIP: He must’ve gone this way.\nJOANNA: He could be anywhere in this mist. So we could we, for that matter.\nFLIP: There’s that feeling again. The psychological barrier.\nJOANNA: (WHISPER) Shhh! Over there! Look!\nFLIP: It’s Percy!\nJOANNA: What’s he doing? Chopping down a tree for firewood?\nFLIP: I don’t think so...\nJOANNA: There’s something inside it. Oh my - (GASPS, THEN REALIZES SHE’S GIVEN HERSELF AWAY) Uh-oh.\nPERCY: I know you’re there.\nFLIP: I’m sorry, we didn’t mean to intrude. What are you doing?\nPERCY: (SWINGS AXE) This is nothing to do with you!\nJOANNA: (DODGES IT) Hey, careful with that thing!\nPERCY: Leave me alone. Go! Go!\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nANDY: (APPEARING FROM NOWHERE ) Or what?\nANDY: ANDY / PERCY:\nJOANNA: Andy, what have you done?!\nANDY: He had an axe! He might have killed you!\nJOANNA: Yeah, but you didn’t have to kill him!\nANDY: I haven’t killed him. He just banged his head on the way down, that’s all.\nJOANNA: He looks dead to me.\nFLIP: No. No, he’s breathing.\nJOANNA: Lucky for you, Andy. What are you doing here?\nANDY: Susannah was worried about you, so I - (FX: FLIP STARTS PULLING THE TREE APART.) Hey, what are you doing?\nFLIP: (PRISING TREE APART) He was trying to get at something in here. and I want to find out what it was.\nJOANNA: Here, let me help.\nANDY: The trunk’s hollow, it must be dead or something. (RETCHING) Oh sweet Mary, there’s something alive in there!\nFLIP: No. Not something. Someone. I think it’s a human being.\nJOANNA: Covered in, what is that? Glue? Jelly?\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nFLIP: I don’t know, and I don’t want to know. (FX: SHE GRITS TEETH AND STARTS TO PULL OCCUPANT OUT. SLITHERING OF JELLY, LIKE A\nVET: HELPING A COW GIVE BIRTH.) Can you help? It’s slippery.\nJOANNA: Ugh. The smell!\nANDY: Hold on, I’1ll take this arm, you take the other — and —\nJOANNA: You were right. It is a person.\nANDY: And she’s alive. She’s breathing.\nFLIP: She?\nJOANNA: Hang on, let me get this muck off her face. (RECOGNISES HER) Oh my God... but... but it can’t be.. [her.] (COMES TO A DECISION)\nJOANNA: Andy, we have to get her out of here.\nANDY: What?\nJOANNA: Before Percy comes around. You saw what he was trying to do. He was trying to kill her!\nFLIP: We don’t know that.\nJOANNA: Well, you can stay and chat if you like, but I’m not leaving her here with him.\nANDY: Joanna, think about this, she can’t really be — (your)\nJOANNA: Whoever she is, she’s alive!\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nANDY: Alright, I’1ll carry her, you lead the way.

OVER THIS:\nHARDWICK: This is the nerve centre of the whole operation. As soon as a report comes in of a plane down, the pilots’ details are passed into this room so the girls here can start establishing contact with those missing in action.\nCONSTANCE: Establishing contact?\nHARDWICK: I’ll admit it’s a little.. disquieting. You’re not religious, are you, Miss Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: Not particularly, no. Why?\nHARDWICK: Good. Because the fact of the matter is that they are trying to make contact.. with the dead.\nCONSTANCE: Pilots who have been killed in combat?\nCHIEF WREN: (IN B/G) One more M.I.A.: Navigator William Dudley. Wren Green.\nHARDWICK: Our fallen heroes.\nHARDWICK: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR: But how can you be sure everyone shot down is dead?\nHARDWICK: We can’t. If we can’t establish contact that means they are still alive somewhere which means we can mount a search and rescue... if possible.\nDOCTOR: So what you are doing here saves lives?\nHARDWICK: Everything we do here is about saving lives. And winning the Battle of Britain, of course!\nCONSTANCE: How exactly do the Wrens establish contact, with the dead?\nHARDWICK: They’1ll pick them up, on those radio transceivers. You see those headsets they’re wearing?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Like telephone operators.\nHARDWICK: Precisely. They each have to monitor a number of frequencies. It’s not an exact science.\nCHIEF WREN: (IN B/G) Photograph of Navigator Reginald Hobbs for Wren Cooper.\nCONSTANCE: And they all have photographs of each of the missing men?\nHARDWICK: We find it helps with making the link. The more the girls know about the M.I.A.s, the better; Age, place of birth, family and so on. But the photographs seem to be the key.\nCONSTANCE: How do you have photographs of every airman?\nHARDWICK: We have pictures of each and every flight squadron. You must have seen them.

Watch the clock, Sergeant.\nWEBSTER: Yes, sir.\nCONSTANCE: They’re bringing them back. Like Susannah. They’re bringing them all back from the moment they died...\nDOCTOR: But why? They won’t be able to leave this place, they won’t be able to fly again.

That’s what brought us down, sir.\nDOCTOR: Anti-aircraft fire?\nYOUNG PERCY: Yes, sir. We flew right into it. The engines caught fire and we went into a tailspin.

Seems he didn’t return through the mist with the others.\nHARDWICK: Meaning he is still here, somewhere.\nCHIEF WREN: Yes, sir.\nHARDWICK: What’s his name?\nHARDWICK: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nCHIEF WREN: Flying Officer Percy Till, sir.\nCONSTANCE: Percy —\nHARDWICK: The man I left with you, Doctor, and Leading Wren Clarke.\nDOCTOR: What are you implying?\nHARDWICK: What did you say to him?\nDOCTOR: Nothing.\nCONSTANCE: Nothing at all.\nHARDWICK: Sergeant Webster, I want a full search of the building and the exclusion zone. An airman called Percy Till has done a moonlight flit.\nWEBSTER: Sir!\nHARDWICK: Tell the men, if he resists, they are authorised to shoot.\nWEBSTER: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: Is that strictly necessary —\nHARDWICK: This is my show, Doctor. You’d better hope my men do find him. Because while he’s here, he’s preventing us from getting back!\nHARDWICK: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 90\nANDY: (FORCES DOOR) There!\nFLIP: Lucky he left his axe outside. Okay, Andy, take it away and hide it.\nANDY: What?\nFLIP: So he can’t find it again. Am I being complicated?\nANDY: You’re a bossy little number, aren’t you?\nJOANNA: Andy, for once in your life, do as you’re told.\nANDY: Fine. Gang up on me.\nJOANNA: What are we looking for?\nFLIP: Clues!\nJOANNA: This looks promising. (FX: SHE PRISES IT OPEN) Ah, it’s a load of war memorabilia. Medals and stuff.\nFLIP: Let’s have a butcher’s. (FX: DIGS THROUGH JUNK) He’s got some photos of himself in the air force and... (SEES SOMETHING) Oh.\nJOANNA: What is it? (BEAT) Hang on, that photo’s your mate.\nFLIP: Yeah. For some reason, he’s got Connie’s identity card...\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nCONSTANCE: Where are we going? Back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: No. You heard the Captain. If they find Percy, they’re liable to kill him.\nCONSTANCE: But we met him, in the future.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. So we need to find him first.\nCONSTANCE: I suppose this is a good place to hide, it’s completely overgrown - (SEES SOMETHING) Oh good heavens.\nDOCTOR: What?\nCONSTANCE: (RECOILING, YUK!) There's... something inside this tree.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. It’s covered in... ugh. Sap?\nCONSTANCE: (RECOILS) The smell!\nDOCTOR: That’s not the worst of it. Look.\nCONSTANCE: A skeleton. A human skeleton. Why would anyone stick a skeleton inside a dead tree?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think they did.\nCONSTANCE: What?\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: This skeleton isn’t the remains of a human. It’s partially- formed.\nCONSTANCE: Partially-formed? You mean... grown?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think it gestated inside this trunk, with this (FX: GLOOP) as some sort of amniotic fluid.\nCONSTANCE: Like an embryo? But it’s an adult!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Which raises several disturbing possibilities.\nCONSTANCE: There are more of them over here. (FX: SHE TRAMPS OVER TO THEM,\nMOVING: AWAY FROM US) Five... six...\nDOCTOR: All at the same stage of development?\nCONSTANCE: No, no. This one has muscle tissue, internal organs, a brain. You were right. They’re being fabricated from the inside out.\nDOCTOR: But the process has been interrupted. They’re no longer needed,\nDOCTOR: so the material is being re-absorbed.\nCONSTANCE: Not all of them. I think this one’s finished.\nDOCTOR: And breathing. Help me!\nDOCTOR: (PULLS) There.\nCONSTANCE: Ugh, it’s covered in — (YUK!)\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: It? Don’t you recognise him?\nCONSTANCE: (RECOGNIZES HIM) Oh. Oh. I see what you mean.\nDOCTOR: It’s an exact duplicate, in every detail. A clone!\nYOUNG PERCY: Alright, don’t move, you two. Don’t even turn around.\nDOCTOR: Why? Because then we might realise you’re not carrying a gun?\nYOUNG PERCY: I said don’t move! (NOTICES BODY) What are you doing, anyway? What’s that?\nCONSTANCE: If you must know, we found him inside a tree trunk.\nYOUNG PERCY: Him?\nDOCTOR: It’s you, Percy. Another you!\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nJOANNA: Hang on. Your mate was in the second world war?\nFLIP: Yeah, she did code breaking at Bletchley Park.\nJOANNA: Where?\nFLIP: Oh, it’s not famous yet. But if Percy met her, that means he was at the R.A.F. place too!\nJOANNA: What R.A.F. place?\nFLIP: Abbey Marston, the ruin on the other side of the woods. But what was he doing there? And how did he end up with her I.D.?\nJOANNA: Don’t look at me, I don’t even understand the question.\nFLIP: Wait a mo. He’s kept a diary, or a journal, or whatever you call it. He’s written it all up! (FX: FLIP LEAFS THROUGH IT) The Doctor... here we are. “I found them in the woods with a sham of myself, created by the instrument beneath the Earth.”\nJOANNA: A “sham”?\nFLIP: That’s what Percy — the old Percy — called the Susannah we found inside the tree. Hang on. (READS) “The Doctor warned me that I had been missed, and...”\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION, OVERLAP WITH FLIP’S LINE)\nOLD PERCY: . a search was in progress. But he told me he had a plan. Between us we lifted the sham and carried it through the woods to an ancient stone circle...\nCROSS: INTO NEXT SCENE FROM NARRATION:\nCROSS: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nYOUNG PERCY: What are we doing here?\nDOCTOR: Call it a hunch.\nCONSTANCE: A hunch?\nDOCTOR: About why this place was built.\nYOUNG PERCY: The stone circle?\nDOCTOR: I’d assumed it was just a marker, for an... instrument beneath the Earth... but what if it’s more than that?\nCONSTANCE: What is it if it’s not just a marker?\nDOCTOR: A control panel. (BEAT) Alright, Percy, let’s lay out your... doppelganger on one of the altar stones.\nPERCY: Which one?\nDOCTOR: This one. (FX: THEY LOWER BODY ONTO LEFT SLAB) I’m guessing it works this way around...\nCONSTANCE: This is just guesswork?\nDOCTOR: Well, I have a fifty percent chance of being right.\nCONSTANCE: Which means you have a fifty percent chance of being wrong!\nYOUNG PERCY: What are you two talking about?\nDOCTOR: This... ‘temple’ was built for a specific purpose.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nYOUNG PERCY: And what’s that?\nDOCTOR: You need to lie down on the other altar.\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION)\nOLD PERCY: I didn’t have a clue what the Doctor meant, but for some reason I trusted him. I suppose it was because I had nothing to lose. So I laid down on the altar...\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nFLIP: (READING) At first, nothing happened. Then a strange fatigue came over me and I closed my eyes. I must have fallen asleep, for how long I could not say...\nCROSS BACK TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION) But when I opened my eyes again, I was lying on the other altar, and feeling more alive than I had ever felt before.\nYOUNG PERCY: (WAKING) What happened?\nCONSTANCE: How do you feel?\nYOUNG PERCY: Fine. No, better than fine. Great. How did I get over here?\nDOCTOR: You didn’t. Look.\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION)\nOLD PERCY: I looked across — to see myself lying on the other altar. Or rather, my body, in what appeared to be a state of unconsciousness. And a state of undress - as I was now wearing its uniform.\nYOUNG PERCY: But I don’t — how?\nCONSTANCE: Your mind moved across. You fell asleep in one body — and woke up in a new one.\nDOCTOR: I, ahem, took the liberty of transferring your accoutrements. Don’t worry. Leading Wren Clarke averted her eyes.\nYOUNG PERCY: Sorry, my ‘new’ body? You mean, the one from inside the tree?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It turns out my hunch was correct.\nYOUNG PERCY: I’m very happy for you. Would you mind explaining it to us lesser mortals?\nWEBSTER: (DISTANT) Over there! There’s someone in the stone circle!\nCONSTANCE: (OVER THIS) Doctor.\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR: I see them. Percy, can you stand?\nYOUNG PERCY: (GETTING UP) Yeah, course, why?\nDOCTOR: Then I recommend you hide behind the altar. Now!\nYOUNG PERCY: Right, yeah.\nCONSTANCE: What about the other one, the ‘original’?\nDOCTOR: It’s now a body without a mind.\nCONSTANCE: But he — it — is still alive. It’s still breathing.\nDOCTOR: Merely an autonomic response, it’s not alive in any real sense.\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION)\nOLD PERCY: I watched from hiding as the soldiers entered the stone circle and surrounded my old body, keeping their rifles raised as though they were expecting it to make a break for it at any second.\nWEBSTER: What’s he doing? Having a kip?\nDOCTOR: No idea. He was like this when we found him.\nWEBSTER: (CONSIDERS, THEN) Alright, men, take him away!\nSOLDIERS: Yes, sir!\nCONSTANCE: What are you going to do with him?\nWEBSTER: Our orders are to return him to the mist.\nWEBSTER: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that will be necessary. Look.\nOLD PERCY: (NARRATION)\nOLD PERCY: I lifted my head, to see that the stone circle was enclosed in an impenetrable fog. The soldiers stepped back in fear as a curtain of mist flowed into the circle and enveloped the body on the altar. A moment later, the body was gone, and the fog faded away to nothing.\nCONSTANCE: What happened? Where’s he gone?\nDOCTOR: Back to his appointment with the Grim Reaper.\nWEBSTER: Alright, men! Back to H.Q., at the double!\nSOLDIERS: Yes, sir!\nCONSTANCE: That’s the purpose of this place.. to bring people back from the point of death, and give them new bodies?\nDOCTOR: And then return the mindless originals to die at their allotted time and place.\nCONSTANCE: Meaning no “temporal paradox”!\nDOCTOR: Precisely. This place isn’t here to bring back the dead for a farewell chat. It’s to enable them to cheat death itself! (BEAT) Alright, Percy. You can come out now!\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nJOANNA: So that’s why we found that other Susannah — it’s the same thing, a “sham”.\nFLIP: Looks like it.\nJOANNA: So all we have to do is take them both to the circle, Susannah\nJOANNA: will get a new body... and we can all go home.\nFLIP: I don’t know if it’s as simple as that.\nJOANNA: What else does it say?\nFLIP: “T returned with the Doctor and Constance -”\nJOANNA: The phone.\nFLIP: We should leave it.\nJOANNA: We don’t know who it will be.\nFLIP: It’ll be someone else who’s dead, and I think we’ve got enough.\nJOANNA: I’m gonna answer it.\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nFLIP: I don’t think that’s a good idea.\nJOANNA: Are you gonna stop me?\nANDY: Hey. Well, I got rid of it, bottom of the septic tank. (FX:\nPHONE: RINGS.) .. What’s going on? Who’s calling?\nJOANNA: How am I supposed to know?\nANDY: I only asked.\nFLIP: Alright.

Who did you hear?\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nYOUNG PERCY: So I was meant to die in the crash — but now I don’t have to?\nDOCTOR: You've been given a second chance.\nCONSTANCE: Now we just have to convince Captain Hardwick...\nHARDWICK: What the hell is going on here? Men! Stand to!\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING INTO THE WAY) Wait, wait!\nHARDWICK: Doctor. Kindly step out of the way.\nDOCTOR: One question. What time is it?\nHARDWICK: Doctor. Until that man goes back, none of us can leave -\nDOCTOR: What time is it? Check your watch.\nHARDWICK: (CHECKS IT) Eight nineteen.\nDOCTOR: “Time’s wingéd chariot is hurrying near”.\nHARDWICK: What?\nCONSTANCE: Didn’t your men tell you? Flying Officer Percy Till was returned to the mist a couple of minutes ago.\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nWEBSTER: Sir! We’ve just regained radio contact with the outside world, Sir.\nHARDWICK: And the telephones?\nWEBSTER: Working again too, sir. Perimeter guard reports that the mist\nWEBSTER: barrier has now lifted.

Flying Officer Till, sir.\nHARDWICK: Explain.\nWEBSTER: I, I can’t, sir.\nDOCTOR: But I can. So shall we continue this conversation inside?\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nANDY: Who was it, Philippa?\nJOANNA: Andy, she doesn’t need to tell you.\nANDY: What?\nJOANNA: Cos whoever it is, they’re gonna be walking out of that fog any\nJOANNA: minute.

That is the only tale you are going to tell.\nYOUNG PERCY: Yes, sir. (BEAT) Well, Doctor, Leading Wren Clarke. Thank you. It seems I owe you my life.\nCONSTANCE: So, Doctor, we’re back in my own time?\nDOCTOR: Not quite, we’re a few years early.\nCONSTANCE: But I could go back. Just... lie low for a couple of years. Find some other work. And then pick up my life where I left off.\nDOCTOR: You could. Is that what you want?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, Yes, I think so. Although it would be better if you could get me back to — (1944)\nWEBSTER: (RUNNING TOWARDS THEM) Captain Hardwick, sir! Doctor!

It’s like a Piccadilly Circus of the afterlife around here.\nSUSANNAH: Well, there’s no room in here for her, not with that clone thing taking up the drop-down bed.\nANDY: Then, if you ladies will excuse me, I’1ll just put her in the other room.\nFLIP: I’1ll go with you.

So what happened?\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure. It’s all a bit of a blur.\nFLIP: I know you found Percy a new body. He wrote about it in his diary.\nCONSTANCE: Yes.

They were just shapes in the mist at first, shadows, but as they walked towards us, I could make out their green-brown uniforms. Some of them still had their flying goggles on. A couple were wearing orange life-jackets. And they were all so young, in their twenties, little more than boys...\nHARDWICK: (LOUD BUT NOT SHOUTING)\nHARDWICK: Halt! Gentlemen!

I’m afraid they’ve brought something else with then...\nCONSTANCE: You mean they’re infected?\nDOCTOR: Possessed. (SHOUTS OUT) What are you? Identify yourselves!\nAIRMAN: (STILL QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY, BUT NOT SHOUTING. STATIC) We are the Static.\nDOCTOR: Let me guess. You have no bodies of your own, so you need to use others to gain entry to this world?\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) We are the Static.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so you mentioned. So where are you from? When people are brought back, they must pass through your domain in order for you to you hitch a ride. So what is it? Another dimension? Another plane of existence?\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, they’re getting closer.\nDOCTOR: And what are you? A disembodied intelligence? But not the same intelligence responsible for the Time Scoop. Because they set\nDOCTOR: it up with a quarantine to stop you using it to escape. And I\nDOCTOR: imagine they had a very good reason so to do!\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) You are wrong. (BEAT) You are the ones who cannot leave.\nAIRMAN: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR: Not while you’re here. We’re all stuck together!\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) You are wrong. New bodies are being created for us to occupy.\nCONSTANCE: The things in the trees, they’re replacement bodies! The thing buried underground is growing them!\nDOCTOR: Yes. And the stone circle allows them to transfer their minds from one body into another. All they have to do is lie on the altars. That’s what they’re for. It’s a resurrection machine!\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) We will occupy our duplicate bodies... and send these rude vessels back to their deaths!\nDOCTOR: (REALISING) With the minds of the airmen still inside them.\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) They are the dead. We live!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m sure you do, after a fashion, but that gives you no right to use human beings as... living lifeboats!\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) (TO EVERYONE) If you submit, you will be allowed to leave. If you resist, you will die.\nHARDWICK: I don’t know what the hell you are, but you don’t know much about us if you think we’ll submit to a foreign power!\nCONSTANCE: (TO THE DOCTOR) Doctor, if they just need the bodies in the trees... why are they bothering with us?\nDOCTOR: Because there is something inside this building they need. Captain Hardwick?\nHARDWICK: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Keep them out.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nHARDWICK: Will do. (TO SOLDIERS) Men.

You must all cease work at once!\nPHONES: ARE STILL RINGING, UNANSWERED.\nHARDWICK: This building is under siege. The dead airmen you have summoned have been co-opted by the enemy and are hostile! You are all to report to the arsenal for defensive duties.\nWRENS: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that will be enough. You’re going to have to destroy every radio and telephone in this room.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 120\nHARDWICK: What? But why on Earth —\nDOCTOR: Because that’s why they’re attacking. They want to secure this\nDOCTOR: equipment, so they can bring more of their kind through!\nHARDWICK: (RELUCTANTLY) Very well, if there is no alternative -\nDOCTOR: We'll also need to secure the stone circle. Captain?\nHARDWICK: I’1ll lead the unit myself. And you’re coming with me.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Constance, Percy?\nDOCTOR: CONSTANCE/YOUNG PERCY: Yes?/Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Smash everything in sight.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nFLIP: (CALLING) Okay, Percy. I’m opening the door.\nPERCY: (INSIDE) I knew you’d be back.\nANDY: Yeah, that’s why you made half a dozen dents in the door.\nPERCY: I tried to stop you. And now it’s too late.\nFLIP: Alright, Percy. I know you met the Doctor back in the war.\nJOANNA: And we know all about the ‘shams’.\nPERCY: Then you know they must be destroyed.\nFLIP: To prevent the Static using them as new bodies?\nPERCY: But you had to interfere, didn’t you!\nFLIP: Yeah, but I’ve locked them in the other caravan. So we can still stop them, can’t we?\nPERCY: You must destroy the shams. It is the only way.\nFLIP: Okay, then that’s what we’1ll do.\nPERCY: I’1l need my axe. Where is it?\nFLIP: Ah... yeah, about that...\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 122\nFLIP: THEM TO THE FLOOR. AS WIRES PULLED OUT, SPARKS AND FIZZLES.

(REALIZES HE’S NOT THERE) Where is he?\nCONSTANCE: He went off with the Doctor, what is it?\nWEBSTER: The Static — we held them back as long as we could, but they’ve broken through, they’ve in the building! You have to get out!\nCONSTANCE: Not until we’re done. (SHE STARTS PULLING APART ANOTHER RADIO).\nWEBSTER: Well, that’s your choice. I’1ll leave you to it.\nYOUNG PERCY: Constance, you should leave.\nCONSTANCE: No. The Doctor said we should destroy every last radio, and I’m not going until I’m done.\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 123\nHARDWICK: You. Set up the Vickers over there. I want this circle secured in every direction!\nSOLDIER: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: We don’t have long. Once they’ve located their new bodies, they’re going to bring them here.\nHARDWICK: What happens if they get in?\nDOCTOR: Once they transfer into their duplicates, their old bodies will be taken by the mist and the barrier will be lifted.\nHARDWICK: And they’1ll be able to leave the exclusion zone.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nSOLDIER: (ALERTING HIM) Captain! They’re coming!\nHARDWICK: Dozens of them. In every direction.\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) You are surrounded. Surrender or die.\nHARDWICK: Then you’ve decided for us.

You go, Percy.\nYOUNG PERCY: No, you should go, you’re a — (woman)\nCONSTANCE: For goodness’ sake. I can handle this on my own!\nPERCY: The fighting’s stopped.\nCONSTANCE: Then this is your chance.

Where are you?\nJOANNA: (CALLS BACK) Andy! Over here!\nANDY: Thank god I found you.\nFLIP: You got the axe, I see. And smell.\nANDY: Yeah. Bit of bad news though. When I passed the caravan, it was empty.\nJOANNA: Now we just have to find the “shams” before they do.\nFLIP: Percy, what — (REALIZES HE’S NOT THERE) Hey. Where’s Percy gone?\nJOANNA: I don’t know. He was here a minute ago.\nJOANNA: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nANDY: Well, in this fog, he could be five yards away and we wouldn’t know about it.\nFLIP: Can we focus on one thing at a time? Cos I think I’ve found something. (SHE PRISES BACK PARTS OF BARK) Inside this tree...\nFLIP: JOANNA/ANDY: (GASP OF RECOGNITION) /Woah.\nFLIP: It’s Constance.\nJOANNA: It’s not really alive, you know that. It’s just, like, meat.\nFLIP: Yeah, I know. Okay. It’s like Percy said. We have to get her — (CORRECTS HERSELF) it out of there... and destroy it.\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 128\nHARDWICK: Doctor. You were right. They’ve bringing their new bodies here. What are they... cadavers?\nDOCTOR: Not, they’re not dead. But they’re not really alive either. They’re mindless flesh.\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) You will surrender. Or die.\nHARDWICK: Down, everyone. Return fire!\nDOCTOR: No, Captain. Don’t shoot them.\nHARDWICK: What?\nDOCTOR: Shoot the clones. The cadavers!\nHARDWICK: Men! Aim for the corpses!\nSOLDIERS: Yes, sir!\nHARDWICK: Cease firing! Doctor - what on Earth’s happening!\nDOCTOR: The mist is coming to take them back.\nAIRMAN: (STATIC) No! No! No! (SCREAMS)\nAIRMAN: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 129\nHARDWICK: . He disappeared! He just disappeared! (TO THE DOCTOR) How did you know that would happen?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t. I just wanted to test a theory. And I was right. Once the duplicate body is destroyed, the original is sent back to where it came from!\nHARDWICK: And the Static?\nDOCTOR: It dies with them. (HE CALLS OUT) Now go! All of you! Return to your own dimension, or you will meet the same fate!\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 130\nJOANNA: Okay, Andy, you know what to do. You have to kill it.\nANDY: Don’t hurry me, alright?\nJOANNA: Well, what are you waiting for?\nANDY: She’s your friend, Flip. You do it.\nFLIP: What?\nANDY: Women’s lib. Take the axe. You kill it.\nFLIP: Alright, I will.\nFLIP: BEAT.\nANDY: You see. Not as easy as it looks.\nJOANNA: Oh, give it here, I’1l do it.\nFLIP: (REFUSES TO GIVE IT HER) Leave off.\nCONSTANCE: (FROM DISTANCE, WITH ‘STATIC’ FX) We know you are there!\nSUSANNAH: (DISTANCE, STATIC) You cannot hide.\nANDY: Oh great, Jo! You led them to us!\nANDY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 131\nJOANNA: So now what do we do now, Einstein?\nFLIP: Just get behind me.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) You will come with us. And bring the duplicate ‘Constance’ with you.\nFLIP: Oh no. We’re not going anywhere.\nSUSANNAH: (STATIC) Put the axe down.\nFLIP: Or what? You’re not armed.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) No. (SMILES) But they are.\nJOANNA: What the — (hell). The mist. I can see people in it. (SURPRISED YELP) They’re all around us! They’re everywhere! Soldiers!\nTOWARDS: US THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH. ALL DIRECTIONS!\nANDY: No, not just soldiers. Those are Navy uniforms, and those guys are air force. (REALIZES) World War Two. They’re all from World War Two!\nJOANNA: (FEARFUL) Oh no. Please. Don’t.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) This is your last chance. You will come with us and bring the\nCONSTANCE: duplicate with you.

EVACUATION IN PROGRESS, NO FIRE-FIGHTING OR BATTLE.\nHARDWICK: Sergeant Webster, report?\nWEBSTER: Sir, the Static got into the building. We couldn’t hold them back — and then a fire started on the second floor -\nHARDWICK: Where are they now? Still inside?\nWEBSTER: No, sir. The men say they saw them retreating into the mist.\nHARDWICK: The same as the ones at the circle! They’ve given up!\nDOCTOR: Sergeant, is everyone accounted for?\nWEBSTER: Hard to tell, sir, we lost a lot of men in the attack -\nYOUNG PERCY: (ARRIVING) (STILL HOARSE/COUGHING FROM FIRE) Doctor!!\nDOCTOR: Percy. Where’s Constance? Where is she?\nYOUNG PERCY: I don’t know. I left her in the radio room.\nDOCTOR: What?\nYOUNG PERCY: She insisted on staying to finish the job. She might’ve got out\nWEBSTER: I haven’t seen her, sir.\nDOCTOR: Then she’s still in there!\nCROSS TO: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 133\nCONSTANCE: (WAKING) What... (COUGHS) No. (CAN BARELY SHOUT BECAUSE OF COUGHING FROM SMOKE) Help! Help.. (COUGHS)\nCONSTANCE: (COUGHING, HARD TO BREATHE) Alright. Nothing else for it. Jump out the window.\nCONSTANCE: Locked. Damn.\nCONSTANCE: (COUGHING FROM SMOKE) Help! Please! Somebody help me! Help! (WEAKENING) Doctor. Where are you? I know you’re out there. So where are you? Where are you!

(BEAT) Come on, Constance. Breathe. Breathe.\nHARDWICK: Doctor, I think —\nDOCTOR: (RESUSCITATING) Right now, I don’t care what you think, Captain. Come on, Constance. Breathe. You can do it, you’re a tough old boot. Come on! Breathe! Breathe!\nHARDWICK: She’s gone, Doctor. She’s dead.\nDOCTOR: No, I can bring her back. I can save her.\nHARDWICK: Not this time, Doctor. It’s too late.\nPERCY: I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have left her alone.\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) No, you shouldn’t, because if you hadn’t left her, she might still be.. (IT HITS HIM) Alive. She might still be alive.\nPERCY: She wouldn’t take no for answer. All she cared about was destroying all the radios, like you said.\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: She didn’t want to let me down.\nPERCY: They were shorting out all over the place, that must be how the\nPERCY: fire started.\nHARDWICK: Very good, Flying Officer. That will be all.\nPERCY: (EDGING AWAY) Yes, sir. (BEAT) Doctor. I’m sorry, truly I am.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Constance. Never giving up, never giving in. (MOMENTARILY OVERCOME) Never give in.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 136\nWEBSTER: RUNS OVER.\nWEBSTER: Sir! The mist barrier’s lifted. And the men’s watches have started ticking again -\nHARDWICK: Very good. Send a car to the village, call the fire brigade.\nWEBSTER: Yes, sir!\nHARDWICK: Not that there will be much left to save. The place’s gutted.\nDOCTOR: And it might be better to leave it that way.\nHARDWICK: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: If you start up again, the Static will make another attempt to break through. It’s not worth the risk.\nHARDWICK: Not my call. I answer directly to the Prime Minister.\nDOCTOR: Then I shall have to have a quiet word with him myself. Make sure this place is closed down - and hushed-up.\nHARDWICK: What it is to have friends in high places.\nYOUNG PERCY: Doctor. I tried to save her —\nDOCTOR: I know. (PATS HIS SHOULDER) But this is something you can do for me.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 137\nYOUNG PERCY: Anything, Doctor, you only have to ask.\nDOCTOR: Once this operation is closed down, I need you to keep a watch over this place. Make sure its properties remain secret. Stop anyone else from trying to bring back the dead.\nYOUNG PERCY: But I have to return to my squadron —\nDOCTOR: No. You cannot leave. You can go as far as the village to pick up groceries but that’s it. You have to spend the rest of your life within half a mile of the stone circle. Because if you leave, even for a single day, there’s a chance somebody may come here, cause a resurrection, and the Static will return.\nYOUNG PERCY: But what about my family, my parents —\nDOCTOR: In the day next day or so, they will receive a telegram informing them of your death. And they must go on believing you are dead. I’m sorry, but you can never see or speak to them again.\nYOUNG PERCY: How long do I have to stay here?\nDOCTOR: As long as it takes. But I’1ll come back, I promise.\nYOUNG PERCY: You’re leaving?\nDOCTOR: I have an appointment to keep, with an old friend. But when I return, you are not to tell me about the Static. (DIGS OUT SOMETHING FROM POCKET) Here, Percy. I want you to have this.\nYOUNG PERCY: Constance’s I.D.?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Something to remember her by.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 138\nANDY: There must be hundreds of them...\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) All those who have died at sea, in the air, on the beaches of France. The casualties of the last war.\nFLIP: But I thought you needed radios to bring them back?\nSUSANNAH: (STATIC) They were needed to create the link. But now we are the link.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) They have been saved... to serve as our temporary hosts. Until new bodies are provided.\nANDY: What are you on about?\nJOANNA: Andy, look in the stone circle. They’ve brought the... clone thing of Susannah here. And it’s wearing one of my t-shirts!\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) You will prepare my duplicate for occupation.\nSUSANNAH: (STATIC) There are clothes here. You will clean the body and dress it, ready for occupation.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) Then I shall transfer, and this body can return to the flames!\nFLIP: (HORRIFIED) That’s how Constance died? In a fire?\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) She thought the Doctor would save her. She was wrong.\nFLIP: But then I found her I.D. I remembered her... I brought her back!\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) Yes. And with her, you brought me!\nCONSTANCE: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: Hello? Flip? Anyone?\nPERCY: (APPROACHING) Hello, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Percy! How good to see you, after all this time.\nPERCY: You only left an hour or so ago.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but for you it was forty years. I’m sorry you had to wait so long.\nPERCY: I did as you said, Doctor. I stayed.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nPERCY: While the world has changed, I have remained constant. Forty years of my life. Forty years alone.\nDOCTOR: And you’ve prevented the Static from coming through. Well done.\nPERCY: Not quite, Doctor. You see. It was just biding its time.\nPERCY: (STATIC) Anyone who is brought back to life carries us within them.\nDOCTOR: You've had it in you all this time, ever since you stepped out of the fog...\nPERCY: (STATIC) Hidden, in the recesses of this human’s mind.\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR: With Percy in the driving seat... unaware he was carrying a passenger. But biding your time? Biding your time for what?\nPERCY: (STATIC) For a new host, Doctor. This body is growing old. Tired.\nDOCTOR: And there’s another body you’ve got your eye on.\nPERCY: (STATIC) You, Doctor. All this time. I have been waiting for you!\nDOCTOR: Your old service revolver. I’m honoured.\nPERCY: (STATIC) Please don’t force me to kill you. It would be a terrible waste.\nDOCTOR: Well, in that at least we are in agreement...\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 141\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) You will stand here until you are needed.\nJOANNA: Needed? Needed for what?\nFLIP: Yeah. What are you waiting for?\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) Our leader.\nANDY: Your leader?\nPERCY: (STATIC) This way, Doctor.\nFLIP: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello, everyone. Constance, you’re looking reassuringly alive.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) This body was saved. By Philippa's remembrance.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s why I gave Percy her I.D. As an “aide memoire”. And Andy, Susannah. This is quite the little soiree.\nFLIP: Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: It turns out that Percy here has been hosting the Static for the last four decades. Waiting for me.\nPERCY: (STATIC) Doctor. You will lay down on the altar.\nDOCTOR: And if I refuse?\nPERCY: (STATIC) Then I will kill your friends.\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: Ah. I knew there had to be a reason you’d kept them alive.\nFLIP: Doctor, you can’t just give in...\nDOCTOR: I don’t have any choice. And if I consent to you transferring\nDOCTOR: into my mind, you’ll let them go?\nSUSANNAH: (STATIC) They will be permitted to live.\nANDY: Yeah, I believe you, thousands wouldn’t.\nDOCTOR: Very well. I shall have to take your word for it.\nFLIP: Doctor, I hope you’re up to something.\nDOCTOR: Not this time, Flip. Let’s get this over with, shall we?\nPERCY: (STATIC) Do not move, Doctor.

Don’t do this...\nPERCY: (STATIC)\nPERCY: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR: (STATIC) Yes, your years of service are at an end. The Static has a new host!

Remove the old man’s body.\nCONSTANCE: ANDY / JOANNA:\nDOCTOR: (STATIC) We can dispose of his remains later.

What did your last slave die of?\nJOANNA: (MOVING BODY) Andy!\nDOCTOR: (STATIC)\nDOCTOR: “Constance”. Take your place on the source altar. Prepare for transference.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC) Preparing.\nCONSTANCE: (STATIC)\nDOCTOR: (STATIC)\nDOCTOR: You may find it difficult to speak at first. If the transference has been successful, nod. (BEAT) Good. Go and stand with the humans.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 144\nFLIP: What about the real Constance, what’s happened to her?\nDOCTOR: (STATIC) Her mind remains in her body. She will regain consciousness, when it returns to die in the flames.\nFLIP: What? No. You can’t. Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (STATIC) Let the mists of time usher her to her death.\nFLIP: No, you can’t. You can’t. (ANDY IS HOLDING HER BACK) Doctor! Please. If you’re still in there.. You can’t send her back! Connie’s still in that body! She’1ll die in the fire! She’1l die!\nANDY: Flip, leave it!\nFLIP: Doctor! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\nFLIP: WITH THE WHOOSHING, CROSS TO:\nFLIP: REPRISE OF END OF SCENE 78:\nDOCTOR: Constance! Constance! (SEES HER) Oh no...

I am still in the source body!\nSUSANNAH: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR: (VOICE AND MANNER BACK TO NORMAL) Oh, yes. And that is where you’1ll stay.\nSUSANNAH: (STATIC) No. You cannot send me back! You cannot! (HORRENDOUS SCREAM)\nSUSANNAH: BEAT. SILENCE SAVE FOR A LIGHT BREEZE.

What the hell just happened?\nSUSANNAH: (GETTING UP) I was lying over there... and I’m over here now.\nDOCTOR: Constance. You can talk now.\nCONSTANCE: (VOICE BACK TO NORMAL) (DEEP BREATH) You sent my original body back to die in the fire. With that... thing inside it.\nFLIP: Connie! (HUGS HER) You’re alive! You’re alive! It’s you!\nCONSTANCE: Yes, Flip. It’s me.\nDOCTOR: Albeit in a new body.\nFLIP: Hang on, Doctor. Your voice. It’s back to normal again!\nDOCTOR: I was wondering when you’d notice.\nFLIP: But you were all Static-y — it transferred from Percy to you —\nDOCTOR: It did. It was in my mind. But I was always in charge. Rather than it controlling me, I was controlling it. (FX: STATIC VOICE) You see. I can still do the voice.\nFLIP: Please. Don’t.\nFLIP: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR: (NORMAL VOICE AGAIN) Sorry. (CLEARS THROAT) It’s quite hard on the throat.\nJOANNA: So, when you were transferring Susannah and Constance across —\nDOCTOR: I transferred their minds into the duplicate bodies, leaving\nDOCTOR: the Static behind. And, in Constance’s case, I made sure the\nDOCTOR: source body was unconscious, so as not to give the game away...\nFLIP: How d’you know how to do all that?\nDOCTOR: With the Static inside my mind, I knew everything it knew. Including how to operate this little set-up here.\nFLIP: But it’s gone now? The Static in your head, I mean?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. It’s still there, buzzing away in the back of my mind like an annoying bee. But I can contain it, until I come up with a more... permanent solution.\nFLIP: But what about all the others, the pilots, soldiers and navy lot? (BEAT) Hang on. They’ve gone!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Returned to the mist, and to the silence of their graves.\nJOANNA: (LEAPS IN LIKE IT’S A QUIZ) Because when Constance and Susannah were all Static-y, they were the ones remembering them!\nDOCTOR: And once they were gone... the psychic link was gone too.\nANDY: So, what you’re saying is, it’s over?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Andy. In summary; it’s over.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 148\nJOANNA: I never thought I’d be so glad to see a caravan site. Not that I can barely see it.\nANDY: Yeah, it’s got dark, all of a sudden.\nDOCTOR: Flip. Check your watch.\nFLIP: How, in this light? (BEAT) It’s ticking, I can hear it ticking!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Time has resumed its relentless march.\nCONSTANCE: And the mist has gone. We’re back.\nFLIP: Doctor. One thing I don’t get. How come you could control the Static when it was in your head, when no-one else could?\nDOCTOR: Ah. I have Percy Till to thank.\nCONSTANCE: Percy?\nDOCTOR: I knew he was possessed by the Static, but I also knew that the longer he remained in the vicinity of the time fissure, the weaker the Static within him would become. The inevitable consequence of prolonged exposure to temporal interference. Happening so gradually it wouldn’t even notice.\nFLIP: But it was still strong enough to control Percy?\nDOCTOR: Yes. He’d lived a long time. His will was comparatively weak.\nCONSTANCE: So you set all this up? You made him stay here for forty years?\nDOCTOR: I gave him those years. If it wasn’t for me, he’d have died in the second world war.\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 149\nFLIP: Not much a life though, stuck in a caravan site.\nDOCTOR: When the Static passed into me, I saw into Percy’s mind, just for a moment. And he thanked me. Yes, he thanked me... (BEAT) And besides. Being stuck in a caravan site is some people’s idea of fun!\nDOCTOR: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 150\nANDY: (INSIDE CAR) It works! Yes!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Eager to leave?\nJOANNA: Yeah, the sooner we see the back of this place, the better.\nFLIP: Well, you got what you came for.\nJOANNA: Yeah. I don’t know how we’re gonna explain Susannah coming back to life.\nDOCTOR: You can’t.\nJOANNA: Sorry, what?\nDOCTOR: Susannah, you can do anything you like, except for one thing. Nobody you knew before can know that you’re alive. Not even your parents. Your resurrection has to remain a secret.\nSUSANNAH: But —\nDOCTOR: No buts. You’ve been given a second chance. That is the price you have to pay.\nSUSANNAH: It’s not going to be easy.\nDOCTOR: I know. Believe me, I know.\nJOANNA: Come on, Susannah, let’s get out of here.\nSUSANNAH: Yeah. Bye Doctor. Flip. Constance.\nSUSANNAH: DW #233: STATIC by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 151\nSUSANNAH: FLIP/CONSTANCE: Bye/Good luck!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, without Percy, how are we going to stop people coming\nCONSTANCE: here?\nDOCTOR: Already sorted. I’ve had a word with a friend at UNIT.\nCONSTANCE: UNIT?\nFLIP: It’s a secret army thing the Doctor knows.\nDOCTOR: This place is going to be declared a no-go zone. Contaminated by radiation. And the stone circle will be demolished. Blown\nDOCTOR: up, if necessary. The Brigadier will enjoy that.\nFLIP: But the thing that’s underground, that’1ll still be there?\nDOCTOR: Yes. So nobody can ever set foot in this place again. (BEAT) It is time we let the dead rest in peace...\nDOCTOR: A BEAT, JUST BIRDSONG AND CALM. AND THEN...\nDOCTOR: THE TELEPHONE STARTS RINGING AGAIN!\nCRASH: INTO CLOSING THEME!\nCRASH: END OF PART FOUR"
