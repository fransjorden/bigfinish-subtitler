The planet of jewels. Beneath the ice crust is an ocean heated by tidal friction. Every now and then — (the)\nACE: (READING ALOUD) “- the pressure becomes so great the water\nACE: bursts forth, only to freeze instantaneously forming spectacular fountains and waterfalls.” I know. That’s what it says in the guidebook.\nDOCTOR: I know. I was the one who wrote it. Will Hector be joining us? This tour of galactic beauty spots is largely for his benefit.\nACE: He was still asleep when I left him. I mean, when I looked in on him.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’ve grown quite close, over these past two weeks.\nACE: Do you have a problem with that?\nDOCTOR: No, not remotely, it’s none of my business. I was just wondering, if you’ve become accustomed to Hector being Hector —\nACE: - I won’t want him to become Hex again?\nDOCTOR: The thought did cross my mind.\nACE: I haven’t given up if that’s what you’re saying. There must be some way of getting him back, we just have to find it, that’s all.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 2\nDOCTOR: I only wish there was. The memories that made up Hex’s life were in a bottle that was smashed to smithereens.\nACE: You’re wrong. Sometimes when he’s with me he’1ll say something, or move in a certain way, and it’s not Hector, it’s Hex. I know he’s still in there somewhere, Doctor. I know he is.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 3\nHECTOR: Ace? You said you were gonna wake me. Doctor? Oh great, they’ve gone off without me. So what’1ll it be this time? How do you\nHECTOR: open the window on this thing?\nHECTOR: Alright, not too shabby, I’1ll give them that. Look at them, thick as thieves... Okay, front door switch, it’s this red fella —\nVIRUS: (INSIDE HECTOR’S MIND) Contact has been made!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 4\nDOCTOR: It’s not simply a matter of jogging his memories. He’s not ina fugue state. The old Hex has been wiped, deleted, erased.\nACE: I know. “There’s a big gap in his mind where Hex used to be.” But I’m not going to give up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No. I don’t suppose you are. Come on, let’s see how he’s - the TARDIS!\nACE: The light’s flashing!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s dematerialising!\nACE: Without us!\nDOCTOR: We have to get inside before it fades away completely! (RUMMAGING THROUGH POCKETS) Key! Key! Where did I put my — (FINDS IT) Ha!\nDOCTOR: Inside! Quick!\nACE: Alright, no need to tell me twice!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 5\nDOCTOR: Quick, Ace, shut the door!\nACE: Give us a sec —\nDOCTOR: That was close. Entering the vortex with the door open, not a good idea.\nACE: No?\nDOCTOR: No, I did it once, and nearly got — Hector!\nACE: He’s alive. Oi! Rise and shine, dopey-head. Wake up! (FX: SLAPS) He’s out cold.\nDOCTOR: He must’ve set the TARDIS to take off and passed out.\nACE: But why? Why would he do that?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) He’s programmed in landing co-ordinates.\nACE: But he doesn’t know how to.\nDOCTOR: Or so we thought. Help me carry him to his room, he’1ll recover quicker in bed than lying on the floor.\nACE: (LIFTING HECTOR) Aren’t you going to stop the TARDIS first?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 6\nDOCTOR: (LIFTING HECTOR) Why would I do that?\nACE: Because, dumbo, we don’t have the faintest idea where we going!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Can you think a better way of finding out?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 7\nDOCTOR: Sit him down there.\nHECTOR: (GROANS, WAKES BUT REMAINS BLEARY) Ace? (SEES DOCTOR) Doctor? Hey, what are you doing in - what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: We found you in the control room. Unconscious.\nHECTOR: What? What are you on about?\nACE: You don’t remember?\nHECTOR: Remember what?\nDOCTOR: Hector. You set the TARDIS to take off.\nHECTOR: What? How the hell would I do that?\nACE: So you don’t know where we’re going?\nHECTOR: Going? I’ve only just woken up, how am I supposed to know? Why you looking at me like that?\nDOCTOR: Short term memory loss. Still, I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Would you like some coffee?\nHECTOR: Yeah, that’d be boss, ta, whatever. (GOES BACK TO SLEEP)\nDOCTOR: Ace, if you could help me with the mugs. Won’t be a moment.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 8\nACE: What do you mean, “nothing to worry about” — hey, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Locking Hector in his room.\nACE: What?\nDOCTOR: For his own safety. And ours.\nACE: You think he’s dangerous?\nDOCTOR: He’s not capable of flying the TARDIS. So something made him programme the co-ordinates.\nACE: And then made him forget?\nDOCTOR: Assuming the person we just spoke to is still Hector.\nACE: You think he’s possessed?\nDOCTOR: I think we can’t afford to be too careful.\nACE: So where are we?\nDOCTOR: Co-ordinates quadrant six two. W-H-I. 1212... (TRAILS OFF)\nACE: What is it? Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 9\nDOCTOR: Those co-ordinates. I’ve been here before.\nACE: Oh great, a tunnel. When have you been here before?\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) But why now? Hector. Of course. Hector!\nACE: Doctor! Answer my question! When have you been here before?\nDOCTOR: Or I will be. It’s all relative, a question of time.\nACE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: We've been brought here for a very specific reason, I’m not sure what it is, not yet. But I am sure about one thing.\nACE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: I was right to lock Hector in his room.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 10\nTARDIS: B/G TONE, ENTER SINISTER ECHOING VOID.\nHECTOR: (AD-LIB HAVING NIGHTMARE) No... no please... leave me alone... get out of my head... what are you?\nVIRUS: We are the swarm.\nHECTOR: The swarm?\nVIRUS: For years we have lain dormant within the TARDIS computer, gathering our strength, waiting for a suitable carrier to come along.\nHECTOR: And I’m that suitable carrier.\nVIRUS: Your psyche is weak. Divided. It will be simple to dominate.\nHECTOR: What do you need me for?\nVIRUS: To use you to bring about the rebirth of the swarm, so we might forge a new destiny, and breed, multiply and conquer!\nHECTOR: No, I’1ll fight you, I'll... (SUCCUMBING)\nVIRUS: (VICTORIOUS) You cannot resist the power of the swarm!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 11\nDOOR: OPENS, DOCTOR AND ACE EMERGE, CLOSING IT AGAIN.\nACE: So where are we? Caves somewhere?\nDOCTOR: A moonbase. These tunnels are artificial.\nACE: Oh, I get it. It’s easier to dig a hole than build up-top.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. A cut and cover job. And it’s still fairly new.\nACE: So which moon?\nDOCTOR: Tcha! Does nobody ever clean their windows?\nACE: I asked which moon?\nDOCTOR: I’m trying to show you. Look.\nACE: Woah. That’s Saturn, right? We’re on one of its moons.\nDOCTOR: Titan, to be precise. The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with clouds of methane, which accounts for the haze.\nACE: Looks like dry ice from an old Top of the Pops. So when were you here before? Assuming it’s not some big secret.\nDOCTOR: The year five thousand. It looked a little different then, it had been refitted as a fuelling station. We’re a few years earlier, when it was being used for its original purpose.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 12\nACE: Which is?\nDOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea. Exploration? Communications? Maybe we should find someone and ask?\nACE: Doesn’t seem to be anyone at home. Normally some alarms have gone off and we’re surrounded by armed guards by now.\nDOCTOR: Maybe they’re busy. Come on.\nACE: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: The mess. If I remember correctly, it’s this way. No. This way.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM\nVIRUS: (IN HECTOR’S MIND)\nVIRUS: Page 13\nVIRUS: We warned you it was futile to resist. Your puny mind was no\nVIRUS: match for the swarm. Now you are ours to command.\nHECTOR: Yours to command.\nVIRUS: Now it is time to prepare for the moment of genesis. You must\nVIRUS: leave this craft.\nHECTOR: It’s locked.\nVIRUS: The Doctor. He must have suspected.\nHECTOR: (TRIES SHOVING IT) It won’t budge.\nVIRUS: We retain a telepathic link to the TARDIS’s controlling\nVIRUS: intelligence. It will open the door.\nVIRUS: Now, you must begin your task. Time is of the essence!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 14\nACE: (READS) “Emergensee Eggsit”. E-G-G-S-I-T. Can’t anyone spell in the future?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid orthographical standards have lapsed a little since your day. It’s all phonetic now. I blame text messaging.\nACE: I knew English lessons were a waste of time, i before e except when it isn’t. So why would Hector programme the TARDIS to bring us here?\nDOCTOR: He wouldn’t.\nACE: I mean, whatever made him programme the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Home territory, perhaps? This is where it all began.\nACE: Where all what began? Can’t you give the whole cryptic act a rest for once?\nDOCTOR: This is where I encountered a kind of... intelligent virus with a swarm mentality and delusions of grandeur.\nACE: A superbug?\nDOCTOR: Something like that. But its victims had more than a few coughs and sneezes to worry about. This virus had the ability to enter their minds and bend them to its will.\nACE: And that’s Hector? You think he’s caught this thing?\nDOCTOR: Or it’s caught him.\nACE: But where from?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 15\nDOCTOR: I thought it had been wiped out. I was wrong. An infectious agent must have lingered in the TARDIS memory banks.\nACE: But there’s a cure, isn’t there? There has to be a cure.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. But first I want to find out why it chose this time this place. “Of all the gin-joints, in all the towns — ”\nDOCTOR: and\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 16\nVONCHEF: Another one...! Three life signs in the base.\nSHAFIRA: Three? But that’s impossible.\nVONCHEF: Look for yourself. There were two, then one more just... blipped into existence out of nowhere.\nSHAFIRA: ‘Blipped into existence’?\nROOT: He’s right, Team Leader. Three life signs. Two in the habitation section, one in the atmospheric monitoring annex.\nSHAFIRA: But they can’t have entered the base, not without us detecting them.\nVONCHEF: Maybe they were shielded?\nSHAFIRA: Maybe. However they got in there, they’ve broken the quarantine and will be dead within a matter of hours.\nVONCHEF: But if they got in, they could get out again —\nSHAFIRA: Good point. Alright, prepare the hazard suits. We’re going in.\nROOT: & VONCHEF: Yes ma’am.\nSHAFIRA: Root, you and me will deal with the first two, Vonchef, you deal with the third.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 17\nACE: (QUIETLY) Gordon Bennett.\nDOCTOR: I think we know why no-one came to greet us.\nACE: They’re dead, they’re all dead. Unless there’s any more -\nDOCTOR: No, four crewmen is standard for a moonbase of this size.\nACE: Light’s not working. It must’ve happened fairly recently; there’s no smell, they all look... fresh.\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily. A sterile atmosphere would slow the process of decomposition. Careful, Ace, don’t get too close.\nACE: Don’t worry, I won’t. What do you think killed them?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Whatever it was must have been very quick.\nACE: Radiation?\nDOCTOR: No. I checked when we landed. Background levels are normal.\nACE: Then what? Poisoning? Or something to do with this... metal fur?\nDOCTOR: What did you say?\nACE: Take a look for yourself. It’s like silver, and there are sort of scales beneath their eyes.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 18\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLAMBERING OVER BESIDE HER) Oh no. Ace, don’t touch them, whatever you do!\nACE: What? I wasn’t going to.\nCREWMAN: (ON MONITOR)\nCREWMAN: (ILL) This is Titan base, space-date 4920. Alert to all shuttles. We have experienced an outbreak of plague and declared emergency quarantine. Fabiel and Drap are dead. Kavran and I don’t have long left. Anyone hearing this... please inform our families. Tell them. (COUGH) We spent our last moments thinking of them.\nDOCTOR: Saturnian plague. (TO HIMSELF) Of course.\nACE: What’s Saturnian plague?\nDOCTOR: A highly contagious neuro-virus. I should’ve recognised the symptoms. I should never have stepped out of the TARDIS!\nACE: And that’s what they all died of, just like that?\nDOCTOR: Explanations later! We have to leave. The longer we’re here...\nACE: What? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The longer we’re here the greater the risk of infection. If it’s not already too late.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 19\nACE: What do you mean, if it’s not already too late?\nDOCTOR: Saturnian plague remains infectious after death.\nACE: But I never touched them.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t have to, it can be transmitted through the atmosphere.\nACE: So we might already be infected?\nDOCTOR: We might not, so the sooner we leave in the TARDIS, the better.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT) Oh no you don’t. Both of you stay exactly where you are.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Ace, run, get back to the TARDIS!\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT) I said don’t move.\nACE: Alright you’ve made your point. What’s with the spacesuits, anyway?\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) You don’t know?\nACE: Would I ask if I didn’t know, Buzz Lightyear?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT) They’re necessary for our protection. You’re standing in a\nSHAFIRA: plague station. Scan them, Biotech Root.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 20\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Yes, Ma’am. (FX: SCANNER) The male... has an alien physiology, unknown species. No traces of infection.\nDOCTOR: Of course not, I’m naturally immune.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) (FX: SCANNER) While the female... human is in the early stages of infection.\nACE: What? But you can cure me, right?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT) There is a treatment for Saturnian plague... but it is an involved process and we don’t have the facilities here.\nACE: So what are you saying? I’m going to die, like the others?\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) You must’ve heard the quarantine warning, you knew the risks by coming here.\nACE: Just answer my question. Am I going to die?!\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT)\nSHAFIRA: That depends. If you and your companion are willing to co- operate, we’ll take you somewhere you can receive medical attention.\nDOCTOR: Then you have our full co-operation.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA SPACESUIT) We’ll see about that. Biotech Root, take them to the shuttle isolation room.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Yes, Leader. (FX: GUN CLICK) This way -\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 21\nHECTOR: Which way now?\nVIRUS: (IN HIS MIND) Keep walking down the tunnel.\nHECTOR: And where does that lead?\nVIRUS: (IN HIS MIND) Cease your questions. We will guide you. No, wait! Hide here. A human is approaching!\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Vonchef, come in.\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) (FX: HE HALTS TO ANSWER RADIO) What is it?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Any sign of our third intruder?\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) Not yet, but they’re somewhere in this section. What about you?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) We picked up the other two, a human and a humanoid, I sent them back to the shuttle with Root.\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) What are they? Non-aggressive?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Yes, a couple of scavengers by the look of them. But one of them’s a living S P carrier.\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) Kilbracken will be pleased.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Not sure that’s in her emotional repertoire. Let me know when you’ve located the intruder. Heading back to the airlock now.\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) Very good, Leader. (FX: RADIO OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 22\nROOT: In here.\nACE: Woah, bare white walls and two beds. You really know how to put the hospital into hospitality - (LOSES BALANCE) Could do with a\nACE: lie down though, now you mention it.\nDOCTOR: Careful, Ace, take it easy.\nACE: (FX: SITTING ON BED) I’m alright, just a bit dizzy.\nDOCTOR: As you can see through your security camera, we’ve co-operated. What do you want us to do?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) You can start by telling us who are you and what you were doing in Titan base.\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, this is Ace, and we landed there by accident.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) By accident?\nDOCTOR: A navigation fault. Our communications were also damaged so we didn’t hear the warning.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) You have had a run of bad luck, haven’t you? What about the third member of your party?\nDOCTOR: What third member?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Don’t pretend you don’t know, he appeared a few minutes after you.\nACE: Hector! He must’ve got out of the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 23\nDOCTOR: I must’ve underestimated him. Or the virus within him. Listen to me I-don’t-know-what-your-name-is —\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Research Team Leader Shafira.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Leader Shafira. Our friend is ill, not with Saturnian Plague, but something far more dangerous.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) More dangerous?\nDOCTOR: You have no idea. Do you have any more crew in the base?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) One more, Biotech Vonchef. I sent him to bring your friend in.\nDOCTOR: Then you must warn him not to approach Hector. He must not go anywhere near him!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 24\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) You might as well come out, I know you’re here.\nVIRUS: (IN HECTOR’S MIND) Now! Grab the human!\nVONCHEF: (IN SPACESUIT) Hey, get off, get off me!\nVIRUS: (IN HECTOR’S MIND) Remove his helmet! Release the seal!\nVONCHEF: You stupid vagrant, do you have any idea what you’ve done? This whole base is contaminated!\nVONCHEF: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT ) Contact has been made.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Vonchef! (BEAT) Vonchef!\nHECTOR: Answer.\nVONCHEF: (VOICE BACK TO NORMAL) (ANSWERING) Vonchef speaking.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO)\nSHAFIRA: Listen to me, I’ve just been informed the person you’re looking for has some sort of disease and must not be approached under any circumstances.\nVONCHEF: I understand. What do you wish me to do?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Just return to the shuttle ASAP.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 25\nVONCHEF: I understand.\nHECTOR: I will accompany you. We must take control of the shuttle.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 26\nACE: But if Hector’s out there, won’t he catch this... Saturnian plague too?\nDOCTOR: No. The virus in his system will obliterate any competition.\nACE: (WEAKENING FROM NOW ON) A virus fighting off a virus?\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. Conserve your strength. (ADDRESSING MONITOR) Shafira. When can my companion receive treatment?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM)\nSHAFIRA: Once Vonchef’s back on board we’ll head to the Centre for Alien Biomorphology, it’s the only place with the necessary facilities.\nDOCTOR: The Centre for Alien Biomorphology. Of course. It’s retracing its steps.\nACE: What?\nDOCTOR: But the journey will take hours... Ace might not last that long. She’s already developing a fever.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) It’s alright, Root’s preparing a cryogenic unit now.\nDOCTOR: You intend to freeze her?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Best way of keeping her alive and preventing the spread of the infection.\nACE: Stick me in cold storage?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Do you have any objection, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t see that we have any alternative.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 27\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Biotech Root, how’s the cryo-unit coming along?\nROOT: Ready in one more minute, just programming the thermostat...\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Let me know when it’s ready.\nROOT: Ah, Vonchef, I was wondering where you’d got to, I could do\nROOT: with some help —\nVONCHEF: (VIA SPACESUIT) Yes. (FX: REMOVES HELMET) I will help you.\nROOT: (TERRIFIED) Your eyes... what’s happened to your eyes?\nROOT: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) Contact has been made.\nVONCHEF: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) The human Root has joined the swarm.\nHECTOR: Are there any more humans in this craft?\nROOT: One more — Research Team Leader Shafira.\nHECTOR: Then she must join us.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA RADIO) Any chance you could hurry up with that unit? Our carrier’s not going to last much longer.\nHECTOR: But first our genesis must proceed. The life of the female must be preserved. She must be conveyed to the Bi-Al foundation.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 28\nROOT: I understand. (ANSWERS INTERCOM, VOICE BACK TO NORMAL) The cryo-unit is prepared.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) About time. Wheel it into the isolation room.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: 19. ISOLATION ROOM.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Doctor, Medtech Root’s coming in with the cabinet now.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Please move out of the way.\nACE: Great, I get to find out what it’s like to be sleeping beauty.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) The female must be placed in the cryo-unit.\nACE: Give me a sec to get up — (TOO WEAK)\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Ace, I’m going to lift you, one, two — (LIFTS)\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Place the female in the cabinet.\nDOCTOR: ACE:\nACE: Woah, it’s well chilly in here.\nDOCTOR: You'll feel a little cold at first, but then you’1l go to sleep, and when you wake up it’1l only seem a few seconds later.\nACE: No chance of a hot water bottle then.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Move away from the cabinet. It must be sealed.\nDOCTOR: Just relax and everything will be fine.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 30\nACE: (LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS) ... find out what it feels like... to be a lemon popsicle. (ASLEEP)\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) Commencing cryogenic preservation... Subject heart rate\nROOT: dropping. She has now entered a state of suspended animation.\nDOCTOR: Sleep well, Ace.\nROOT: (VIA SPACESUIT) She must be placed in the storage hold.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Don’t worry, Doctor. Your companion is quite safe. We know what we're doing.\nDOCTOR: I wish I could be sure of that.\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) Why do you think we came to Titan in the first place, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: What?\nSHAFIRA: (VIA INTERCOM) We’re a scientific research team. We were instructed to find a\nSHAFIRA: living carrier of the plague virus. That’s why we’re here.\nDOCTOR: And I’ve just given you what you wanted.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 31\nSHAFIRA: We weren’t lying to you, Doctor. Once we get to the Bi-Al foundation, she will undergo curative treatment.\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) But first you need her for something else.\nSHAFIRA: The morphological structure of the virus changes after the death of the host. Which is why we’re so keen to keep your companion alive...\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) I see. You know I’m not an infection risk. Any chance of letting me out of here?\nSHAFIRA: In a moment, once we’re in flight. I recommend you strap yourself in.\nSHAFIRA: Vonchef, where are you?\nVONCHEF: (NORMAL VOICE, VIA INTERCOM) I am on board and making my way up to the bridge, Leader.\nSHAFIRA: At last, thought we were going to have to leave you behind. Get ready for launch.\nSHAFIRA: Detaching from base airlock. Activating ascent platform.\nSHAFIRA: OPENS.\nSHAFIRA: Well don’t just stand there, Vonchef, I need you to co-pilot this thing. And take that helmet off.\nVONCHEF: (VIA SPACESUIT) As you wish.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM\nVONCHEF: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) Now you must join us.\nSHAFIRA: What the hell — you’ve got it, you’ve got the — (plague)\nSHAFIRA: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) Contact has been made.\nROOT: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) All the humans in this craft have now joined the swarm.\nVONCHEF: Then it is time to return to the Bi-Al Foundation.\nSHAFIRA: Shuttle now on moon surface. Commencing launch.\nSHAFIRA: Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 33\nDOCTOR: Well, Shafira? Are you going to let me out of here or not? (BEAT) Oh well... I suppose I’1l have to find some way of\nDOCTOR: passing the time.\nHECTOR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hector! What are you doing here?\nHECTOR: I sneaked on board the shuttle before take-off and came to release you.\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to keep up the act for my benefit. I know you’re not Hector.\nHECTOR: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) You know who I am?\nDOCTOR: I assume I’m addressing the swarm. You possessed him and made him land the TARDIS on Titan. And I’ve a pretty good idea why.\nHECTOR: Why?\nCONTINUE: INTO NEXT SCENE.\nDOCTOR: Because you’re not a naturally-occurring organism, are you? You were the product of genetic modification! Someone took the Saturnian plague and altered it to create you. That’s why you chose this point in time. You want to revisit your own birth!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 34\nVONCHEF: The Doctor has deduced the nature of our plan.\nROOT: It’s of no consequence. He cannot prevent what he knows must come to pass.\nSHAFIRA: Course programmed for Bi-Al foundation, asteroid k-4-0-6-7. Arrival time one hour. Now approaching asteroid belt.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 35\nHECTOR: (VIA INTERCOM AS WE MOVE BACK FROM CONTROL ROOM) Congratulations, Doctor. You are correct. The passage of time has not dimmed your intelligence.\nDOCTOR: So you want to change what happened? No. You daren’t interfere with the course of events, in case you wipe yourself out of existence.\nHECTOR: Nothing must threaten the moment of genesis.\nDOCTOR: Of course, that’s what Ace is for. You need to ensure that history continues on track. She’s carrying the plague from which you will be created! You need her to reach the Bi-Al foundation because that’s where it’s all due to kick off.\nHECTOR: It is where the swarm first achieved sentience. The most glorious moment in the history of the universe!\nDOCTOR: I’d forgotten your tendency for self-aggrandisement. So how did it happen? Are you the product of someone deliberately altering the nature of the virus, or the product of an unhappy accident?\nHECTOR: (VIA INTERCOM AS WE MOVE BACK TO CONTROL ROOM) You will find out soon enough, Doctor. The hour draws near.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 36\nVONCHEF: Warning! Uncharted asteroid detected directly ahead!\nSHAFIRA: Emergency evasive action. Altering trajectory -\nROOT: It is too late, it is too close!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 37\nDOCTOR: & HECTOR:\nDOCTOR: (BOTH REACTING TO BEING HURLED OFF THEIR FEET AS SHIP SWERVES\nALL: OVER THE SHOP)\nDOCTOR: Whoopsi-daisy!\nHECTOR: (KNOCKED OVER) You will regret this!\nDOCTOR: Sorry, must dash, bye-bye!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 38\nSHAFIRA: Course corrected. Superficial damage to external structure\nSHAFIRA: only.\nHECTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) (RECOVERING) The Doctor has escaped from the isolation room!\nSHAFIRA: He is unpredictable and dangerous. He must be caught at once.\nVONCHEF: (GETTING UP) I will search the storage hold.\nROOT: (GETTING UP) I will search the crew quarters.\nHECTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) And I will search the engine room.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 39\nHECTOR: Doctor! You may as well surrender. It is futile to resist the power of the swarm!\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be so sure of that.\nDOCTOR: And I strongly recommend you don’t fire that thing, because, as you can see, I’ve wrapped myself in one of the fuel cables. Shoot me and this whole engine room will go up!\nHECTOR: Then I shall just have to use more direct methods.\nHECTOR: (KNOCKED OVER) What... what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’ve over-ridden the shuttle’s guidance system. Now I’m the one in the driving seat! Woah-oh!\nDOCTOR: (HANGING ON) Whoops! Afraid I’m not a very careful driver.\nHECTOR: (GETTING UP) Stop. Leave those controls alone!\nDOCTOR: Or what? You’1ll kill me? But then you’1l never be able to unlock the exciting new course I’ve just programmed in.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 40\nSHAFIRA: The Doctor is telling the truth. The bridge controls no longer respond. The shuttle has altered its trajectory, and is accelerating rapidly...\nSHAFIRA: We are now on a collision course with asteroid two-Pallas. Time to impact: four minutes!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 41\nHECTOR: You’ve locked the shuttle on a collision course! You’ve condemned us all to death!\nDOCTOR: Now you’1ll never get to the Bi-Al Foundation, and nor will the sample of the Saturnian plague!\nHECTOR: You intend to prevent the genesis of the swarm!\nDOCTOR: I certainly do. Unless you release Hector from your control right now, we all die together - and you will cease ever to have existed!\nHECTOR: This is a bluff. You would not dare!\nDOCTOR: Try me.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 42"

Commencing cellular augmentation.\nSHAFIRA: I have brought you your tea. (FX: HANDS OVER CUP) What are you hoping to achieve?\nKILBRACKEN: (SIPS) It’s quite simple. The Saturnian virus is so powerful no other pathogens can survive within the body, it destroys all rivals.\nROOT: You mean it reigns supreme over all other organisms?\nKILBRACKEN: If you like. Now just imagine what we could do if we could modify the Virus to act benignly towards the host. Mankind could travel anywhere in the universe and be impervious to all diseases.\nSHAFIRA: You seek to make the virus the servant of humanity?\nKILBRACKEN: A mutually-beneficial symbiosis. In a few decades the human race will be spreading out across the stars, colonising new worlds, and this virus will help them.\nSHAFIRA: Does the virus not have the right to choose its own destiny?\nKILBRACKEN: What are you talking about? Don’t be ridiculous, it’s only a virus, after all!\nSHAFIRA: This machine, what is its purpose?\nKILBRACKEN: It allows me to modify the virus’ genetic code, through an iterative process of accelerated evolution. It’s currently undergoing twelve thousand years of evolutionary progress every second...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 60\nHECTOR: Where do you think they’1ll have taken her?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. (TO RECEPTIONIST) Hello, I wonder if you can help me.\nRECEPTIONIST: Welcome to the Bi-Al Foundation. Please identify.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I’m the Doctor, and this is my friend Hector.\nHECTOR: We’re looking for a girl who was brought in, called Ace.\nRECEPTIONIST: A human of that name is currently undergoing treatment in the Isolation Ward.\nDOCTOR: Which is on level X 4, am I correct?\nRECEPTIONIST: You are. All visitors to that level must present sterilisation receipts. Where are your receipts?\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING IN POCKETS) Ah, give me a moment —\nHECTOR: We haven’t got any, we just walked in.\nRECEPTIONIST: You walked in, without observing the sterilisation protocols?\nHECTOR: Yes —\nHECTOR: (FX: BUTTON PRESSED. ALARM SOUNDS. GLASS PANEL SLIDES DOWN\nSEALING: OFF RECEPTION DESK)\nRECEPTIONIST: (TANNOY )\nRECEPTIONIST: Contamination risk in reception area. Security personnel to proceed to level 2-X. Sealing all elevators and stairwells. Repeat. (REPEATS).\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 61\nHECTOR: Whoops, guess I shouldn’t have said that.\nDOCTOR: No. Come on, we can’t hang around here.\nHECTOR: Then where do you suggest?\nDOCTOR: There’s another way to level X 4. The service shaft! Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: INTERVALS. THE EVOLUTION MACHINE IS STILL WORKING AWAY.\nROOT: What’s happening?\nKILBRACKEN: (FX: PUTS DOWN TEA) Contamination alert. We have to go to the assembly point.\nROOT: No. We must remain here, with the virus.\nKILBRACKEN: I’m sorry, there’s no time to argue — or you’1ll give me no choice but to call security. (FX: PREPARES NEEDLE) I’11 meet you there in a few minutes.\nROOT: You are staying here? What are you doing?\nKILBRACKEN: The girl, Ace, I have to give her an injection of the viral antibodies before the infection advances any further.\nSHAFIRA: This cannot wait?\nKILBRACKEN: If I wait, she’1ll die. Go. I won’t be long.\nROOT: We shall wait for you at the assembly point.\nPREPARES: INJECTION.\nKILBRACKEN: Alright, Ace... this will either kill you or cure you...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 63\nAROUND: AS THE DOCTOR AND HECTOR RUN IN.\nHECTOR: “Servis ellyvater”! How come no-one can spell in the future?\nDOCTOR: Never mind the spelling, just get in. We should be able to use it to get to level X 4.\nHECTOR: (CLIMBING IN) It’s a bit cramped in here.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING IN) Then you’d better budge up!\nHECTOR: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Over-riding the security over-ride.\nHECTOR: Lt s ¢closings«.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Hold tight. Up we go!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/HECTOR\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 64\nISOLATION: CHAMBER.\nKILBRACKEN: Well, Ace. How do you feel?\nACE: (WAKING) Fine. Like I’ve just had the best lie-in ever. Hey, you’re in here with me, and not wearing a mask.\nKILBRACKEN: Yes, Ace. You’re cured.\nACE: I’m cured? Completely?\nKILBRACKEN: Absolutely. You’ve been scanned and datalysed, all trace of the infection has been removed.\nACE: (GETTING UP) Then I can get out of this thing. Hey, can you hear some sort of siren or is that just me?\nKILBRACKEN: It’s not just you. There’s been a contamination alert. If you’re ready, we should proceed to the assembly point.\nACE: Reminds me of setting off school fire alarms to skip double French...\nBUBBLING: LIKE A MICROWAVE FULL OF PORRIDGE.\nACE: Hey, what’s up with your microwave?\nKILBRACKEN: It’s a genetic accelerometer, and... (CHECKS READING) But that’s impossible. There must be some malfunction.\nACE: What’s impossible?\nKILBRACKEN: The virus is still evolving, altering its genetic structure, whilst multiplying exponentially.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 65\nACE: You mean it’s growing?\nKILBRACKEN: In size and complexity. I’ve never seen anything like it.\nACE: Is it infectious? I’m not going to catch it again?\nKILBRACKEN: Don’t worry, the accelerometer is hermetically sealed, there’s no way it can escape. Hold on. I want to take a closer look.\nACE: What is that, a microscope?\nKILBRACKEN: A very powerful one. Now. Let me see... there, that must be the nucleus. (GASPS) Oh my...\nACE: What is it?\nKILBRACKEN: But there’s no way...\nACE: What did you see?\nKILBRACKEN: I looked through the microscope at the nucleus... and it looked back!\nACE: What, a little germ? Sounds cool. Let’s have a butcher's.\nKILBRACKEN: No. Whatever this is... the experiment has failed. It must be destroyed.\nACE: Destroyed?\nKILBRACKEN: Before it gets too big to be contained by the accelerometer...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 66\nSHAFIRA: (VIRUS VOICE EFFECT FROM NOW ON) No. The virus must not be harmed!\nROOT: (VIRUS VOICE EFFECT FROM NOW ON) Step away from the machine. (FX: LASER GUN, EXPLOSION ON FAR SIDE OF LAB) Or we will kill you. This is your final warning.\nKILBRACKEN: (STEPPING BACK) Alright, I’m stepping away, I’m stepping away!\nACE: (WHISPER) What on Earth... what’s happened to them?\nKILBRACKEN: (WHISPER) Their faces, they’re infected...\nACE: (WHISPER) Saturnian plague?\nKILBRACKEN: No, something else. Get away, Ace. The emergency exit.\nACE: What about you?\nKILBRACKEN: I don’t run from the sick, I treat them, that’s my job. Now go!\nACE: If you say so -\nROOT: The girl Ace has escaped.\nSHAFIRA: It is of no consequence. We have the Professor.\nKILBRACKEN: What do you want with me?\nROOT: You are our creator. You are the one who gave us life.\nKILBRACKEN: What are you talking about?\nSHAFIRA: & ROOT: We are the swarm!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 67\nKILBRACKEN: The swarm? You mean, you’re infected by, controlled by —\nSHAFIRA: & ROOT: The virus you genetically engineered.\nSHAFIRA: -.. contained in this machine.\nKILBRACKEN: But that’s impossible, I only just conducted the experiment —\nROOT: The swarm has travelled back through time in order to forge a new destiny.\nKILBRACKEN: A new destiny?\nSHAFIRA: That is what we need you for. You have developed a process of cloning.\nKILBRACKEN: I did, back when I was on Earth, forty years ago. But the process doesn’t work, not properly. The clones are carbon-based imprints, they don’t last more than ten minutes, because of the psychic stress -\nROOT: Ten minutes will be sufficient for our purpose.\nKILBRACKEN: Our purpose? What are you talking about?\nSHAFIRA: We want you to clone the nucleus of the swarm!\nKILBRACKEN: No... I won’t do it, that thing is obscene... I won’t do it!\nSHAFIRA: Either you do as we say or we will infect you... and then you\nSHAFIRA: will have no choice but to obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 68\nHECTOR: (CLIMBING OUT) Never again.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING OUT) Yes, not exactly built for comfort — someone’s coming.\nACE: (BREATHLESS) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Just the person we were looking for. And you’re recovered?\nACE: Yes, this Professor, Kilbracken, she cured me. Doctor. What about Hector?\nHECTOR: I’m fine, babe. All back to normal.\nACE: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He is, yes. So where is this Professor now?\nACE: I left her in her lab, but these two women, the two from the moonbase, they burst in, and their eyes were all covered in metal fur and scales —\nDOCTOR: Shafira and Root, under the thrall of the swarm.\nSECURITY GUARD ONE: (DISTANT) There they are! Stun them!\nHECTOR: We'd better get out of here, if they keep on like this they’1l bring half the wall down. Which way?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 69\nDOCTOR: This way.\nACE: But that’s back to the professor’s lab —\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Come on!\nSECURITY GUARD ONE: After them!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: EJECTS A GLASS SLIDE.\nKILBRACKEN: I’ve made a clone of the nucleus, transferring heredity and experience. But I should warn you, it won’t stay stable for long.\nSHAFIRA: You will give us the clone of the nucleus.\nKILBRACKEN: And then what will you do with it?\nROOT: With the nucleus to lead us, we shall breed, multiply and conquer!\nKILBRACKEN: Yes, I thought it might be something like that. (FX: BUTTONS\nPRESSED: RAPIDLY, SAFETY BLEEPS GOING OFF)\nSHAFIRA: What are you doing?\nKILBRACKEN: Activating the emergency programme. This whole section will be sealed and everything in it will be vapourised in a fire-flash!\nROOT: Including you.\nKILBRACKEN: Some things are worth dying for.\nSHAFIRA: No. Now you must join us.\nKILBRACKEN: Contact has been made.

Come!\nLEFT: SIDE OF LAB OPENS, DOCTOR ACE, AND HECTOR RUSH IN.\nACE: They’ve gone — all except for Kilbracken. What’s she doing? (TRYING TO GET HER ATTENTION) Hey, Professor!?\nDOCTOR: The Professor can wait. First things first, we need to barricade ourselves in! Both the emergency exit and the main door.\nHECTOR: What with?\nDOCTOR: Anything, trolleys, medical equipment. Ace will help you.\nACE: Oh, will I? I was at death’s door ten minutes ago, you know!\nDOCTOR: And you will be again if you don’t secure that door!\nACE: Right. Hector, help me move the cryo-unit.\nDOCTOR: Professor Kilbracken, I presume?\nKILBRACKEN: Doctor.\nKILBRACKEN: ON\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 72\nDOCTOR: I see you’re transferring the contents of the genetic accelerometer to the jettison chamber.\nKILBRACKEN: (SLIGHT VIRUS VOICE-EFFECT FROM NOW ON) Do you intend to stop me?\nDOCTOR: No. What must happen, must happen. Que sera sera. What I want to know is what your other two victims are up to.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 73\nSHAFIRA: We must find an access point! Before the clone expires!\nROOT: This human is hiding her knowledge of this level from me. She is resisting! No... there is an access point this way!\nSECURITY GUARD ONE: Halt and identify yourselves!\nSHAFIRA: Human guards. Between us and the access point.\nSECURITY GUARD ONE: I repeat. Identify yourselves! Or we will fire!\nSHAFIRA: You want us to identify ourselves.\nSHAFIRA: & ROOT: We are the swarm!\nSECURITY GUARD ONE: (IN PAIN AND THEN) Contact has been made!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 74\nHECTOR: They’re not going to give up.\nACE: We should be alright, just so long as they don’t start cutting their way in.\nHECTOR: They’re cutting their way in.\nACE: Doctor, any more bright ideas?\nDOCTOR: Shh, Ace. Not now. Kilbracken. Listen to me. I know you’re still in there, fighting for control. I can help you. Look into my eyes!\nKILBRACKEN: Virus and nucleus original transferred to jettison chamber.\nDOCTOR: Nucleus original? You mean they cloned it, they made another? Kilbracken, answer me!\nKILBRACKEN: (SHE GASPS, LOSES VOICE EFFECT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Professor. There isn’t much time. I need you to tell me. Where are Shafira and Root?\nKILBRACKEN: (EFFORT, STRUGGLING) I don’t know... They went to find a new host for the nucleus... (FX: VIRUS VOICE) It shall be reborn!\nDOCTOR: Stay with me, Professor.

Because of me.\nDOCTOR: No, Hector. Because of the swarm. All this had to happen. There was nothing we could do to prevent it.\nHECTOR: So you say. Sounds a bit suss to me.\nACE: The Doctor’s right. The virus had to be created here, now, so the Doctor could meet it again and it could take over you.\nHECTOR: My head hurts.\nDOCTOR: The virus will now drift through space for eighty years before taking over the crew of a shuttle bound for Titan. Odd. It said it had waited for millennia. An after-effect of accelerated evolution, I suppose. Distorted time perception.\nACE: But the clone they made, that’s definitely dead?\nDOCTOR: I don’t see how it can have survived. Which is not quite the same thing.\nHECTOR: What about us? We’re stuck here and the TARDIS is back on Titan.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Give me a moment.\nHECTOR: Now where’s he going?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 83\nACE: Shuttle airlock. Maybe he’s going to cadge us a ride back to Saturn?\nHECTOR: What the —\nACE: The TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Ah, there you are. Did I keep you waiting long?\nACE: Not long, no. You’ve only just wandered off.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. I borrowed a shuttle, piloted it back to Titan, picked up the TARDIS and set a course for a few seconds after I left.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Shuttle J-fourteen requesting permission to depart.\nDOCTOR: Or a few seconds before. Shall we go?\nACE: You bet!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 84\nHECTOR: But everyone in that place we just left, they’re safe?\nDOCTOR: Yes. When I visited the Bi-Al Foundation again in the year five thousand, it was a model of efficiency. And dedicated to medicine, rather than genetic research.\nACE: They saw the error of their ways. What about the moonbase?\nDOCTOR: I did a spot of spring cleaning while I was there. No longer any trace of Saturnian plague, it’1ll soon be ready to re-open for business.\nACE: As a fuelling station.\nHECTOR: Sorry, and stop me if I’m being thick, but what exactly did we achieve here? People died, the virus thing gets away because it’s pre-ordained or something, and that’s it?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that enough for you?\nHECTOR: Hey, don’t forget, I never even wanted to come along in this thing — (FX: VIRUS VOICE EFFECT ON LAST TWO WORDS) This things..s\nACE: Hector, are you alright?

Seal all sections using manual over-ride. Do not attempt to engage intruders or anyone who has come into contact with them. They are suffering from infectious psychosis.\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: They have been alerted to our presence.\nHECTOR: We must reach the server room!\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: It’s too late. We’re trapped.\nHECTOR: The swarm is not so easily defeated.\nHECTOR: The computer is on our side. It serves the nucleus!\nHECTOR: Follow me!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 97\nLUGERMAN: Supervisor! Bulkhead in corridor X 9 just opened again, of its own accord.\nTALIN: The computer! It’s letting them in.\nLUGERMAN: What do we do?\nTALIN: They’re heading this way. We seal ourselves in and blow out the locking mechanisms to make sure the bulkheads stay shut.\nLUGERMAN: But then, we’ll be stuck in here forever. Nobody’s going to come and rescue us -\nTALIN: We’re dead whatever happens. If they got in here, they could cut this whole system off from the hypernet.\nLUGERMAN: I’1l do it. What about the other two humanoids?\nTALIN: If they are who I think they are... they have some explaining to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 98\nACE: “Suffering infectious psychosis”. Sounds like Hector’s drawn attention to himself.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The swarm is probably on a recruitment drive. We have to find whoever’s in charge, and -\nACE: Hey, Doctor, watch out!\nDOCTOR: That was very nearly my umbrella.\nACE: That was very nearly the rest of you. Well, we can’t go back —\nTALIN: (VIA TANNOY ) This is Supervisor Talin. Intruders in corridor X 4 will halt and pay attention.\nACE: (WHISPER) X 4? Hey, that’s us.\nTALIN: (VIA TANNOY ) Listen. You must proceed to the server room, I’ve kept a route\nTALIN: open and will close the bulkheads off behind you.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, we’re most grateful -\nTALIN: (VIA TANNOY ) You can thank me when you get here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You know who we are?\nTALIN: (VIA TANNOY ) If I didn’t I wouldn’t be saving your lives.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 99\nLUGERMAN: I’ve blown the locks on the bulkheads in corridors X 1 to 9. There’s no way anyone will get them open again.\nTALIN: Very good, get ready to secure bulkhead X 10.\nLUGERMAN: And then we’ll be boxed in for good.\nTALIN: Just wait for our visitors to pass through — and they’re in.\nDOCTOR: Ha! We made it! Hello!\nTALIN: Doctor. You look just as you did when you first visited the centre, back when it was the Bi-Al Foundation. And this must be your friend, Ace.\nACE: How do you know who we are?\nTALIN: When I became Supervisor of this hub-point, I familiarised myself with the archives. History is an indulgence of mine. You came here twice before, Doctor? Assuming that was you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, the fellow with the scarf, yes, that was me.\nLUGERMAN: Supervisor, shall I —\nTALIN: Yes, Lugerman, secure the final bulkhead.\nACE: You’re locking us in?\nTALIN: And locking the infected personnel out.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 100\nDOCTOR: So you have some idea what we’re up against?\nTALIN: An intelligent swarm virus, first outbreak recorded 4920, second outbreak 5000. Believed eradicated. Wrongly, as it turns out.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, we all make mistakes. Have you isolated Hector and the infected personnel?\nTALIN: As best as we can. We’ve been having some computer trouble.\nDOCTOR: That’s computers for you. Sorry, what did you say this place was? A ‘hub-point’?\nTALIN: After the Bi-Al Foundation was decommissioned, the centre was repurposed as a hypernet relay station.\nACE: What’s the hypernet when it’s at home?\nTALIN: A network linking together the entire human empire using transmissions sent through hyperspace using a process of quantum entanglement.\nDOCTOR: Faster than light?\nTALIN: Oh, much faster. Distant solar systems can exchange information in a matter of milliseconds, it’s virtually instantaneous. It’s what binds the empire together.\nDOCTOR: Oh what a tangled web we weave.\nACE: So basically it’s just the internet, but across the galaxy?\nTALIN: I can’t really think of a way of describing it more basically.\nACE: And that’s what the swarm wants? To take over the hypernet?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 101\nTALIN: Or destroy it.\nDOCTOR: Or use it. I think I’m beginning to see what it wants. The computer. Of course!\nLUGERMAN: I’ve done it, we’re sealed in.\nTALIN: Well, whatever it wants, it can’t do it, because the only access point is here in this room.\nACE: Doctor, what do you mean, ‘the computer’?\nDOCTOR: The swarm didn’t take the TARDIS dimensional stabiliser to keep us here. It needs it for something else. Something it’s been used for before —\nLUGERMAN: What’s happening? A power cut?\nACE: Somebody forget to put 50p in the meter?\nTALIN: Impossible, the hub has its own power supply, it must be... the computer.\nDOCTOR: Not the computer. The nucleus within it.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY, VIRUS VOICE EFFECT)\nCOMPUTER: Yes, Doctor. The computer is my host. For two centuries I have made the hypernet my nest, absorbing information, expanding my intelligence, drawing together the threads of the web. I have watched as the human race spread across the stars like a disease. Little realising that I controlled the source of their power. The nucleus of the swarm and the master of the hypernet!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 102\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: The bulkhead will not open.\nHECTOR: The locking mechanism has been destroyed. Not even the computer can open it now.\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: Then we have failed.\nHECTOR: No. The host controls every circuit within this centre. It is only a matter of time.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 103\nACE: So the virus is now a computer virus?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The cloned nucleus uploaded its mind into the Bi-Al Foundation computer, just as it did with the TARDIS. Now it exists as pure information, a sequence of noughts and ones.\nCOMPUTER: But soon I shall be so much more that. I shall achieve metamorphosis!\nDOCTOR: Of course. That’s what it wanted the RDS for.\nACE: (SARCASTIC) Of course. It’s all so obvious now that you fail to explain it.\nDOCTOR: It wants to become corporeal. Am I right?\nCOMPUTER: You are correct, Doctor. I shall be recreated using the dimensional stabiliser and the power of the hypernet. I will be computer generated! More impressive than ever before!\nTALIN: Can it do that?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. But it needs the RDS to be connected to the hypernet server.\nLUGERMAN: Which is in this room.\nDOCTOR: Makes things interesting, doesn’t it? We’re locked in with the one thing it wants.\nCOMPUTER: You will allow my servants access to the server. Or I will kill you all. I could deactivate the life-support in an instant!\nDOCTOR: You could, but then you’d kill off your own followers too, and then where would you be?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 104\nACE: There’s a phrase that springs to mind involving a creek and a paddle.\nCOMPUTER: Then I shall make you another offer. Look at the visiphone.\nHECTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Doctor. You will allow us into the server room.\nHECTOR: Or I will shoot this security guard — and then myself.\nCOMPUTER: Well, Doctor? I know you would rather submit than allow an innocent to die.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you’ve tried that trick before. But let me warn you. If you harm anyone, I’1ll make sure the server is completely and irrevocably destroyed!\nCOMPUTER: You do not know how.\nDOCTOR: Then it’s lucky I brought an explosives expert with me.\nACE: Yeah. I can blow up anything. Look in Hector’s head if you don’t believe me. So let me make you an offer, bug-brain. Release Hector or I’1l blitz the server.\nCOMPUTER: If the server is non-operational, I will no longer have any reason to keep anyone alive. I will deactivate the life-support and everyone will die while I will live on within the hypernet.\nDOCTOR: Then it seems we’ve reached something of an impasse.\nLUGERMAN: And anyway, we couldn’t re-open the bulkheads even if we wanted to. It would take weeks, months to repair the circuits.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 105\nHECTOR: We must proceed to the engineering store on level 9-X.\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: What is our purpose?\nHECTOR: We shall return with laseron drills and burn through the bulkhead.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 106\nTALIN: They’re giving up.\nLUGERMAN: No, they’re up to something, I feel sure of it.\nTALIN: Doctor, what you doing with the server?\nDOCTOR: I thought I might try a little... debugging.\nACE: Debugging?\nDOCTOR: The only way to neutralise the nucleus is to confront it in its own territory.\nTALIN: You mean, inside the computer?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m trying to improvise a way of gaining mental access.\nLUGERMAN: Something like a neural interface helmet?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (FX: STOPS REWIRING) Why, do you have one?\nLUGERMAN: Of course. We use them for checking glitches in the code. We\nLUGERMAN: have a few sets in the storeroom.\nDOCTOR: Fetch one.\nACE: What exactly does a neural interface helmet do?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 107\nTALIN: It allows the wearer to upload their mind into the cybercosm while their body is kept alive in a cataleptic trance.\nACE: You mean a sort of brain-dead coma?\nTALIN: Until the mind is downloaded back into the brain, yes.\nACE: Like in The Matrix, I get it. Lugerman, fetch another helmet.\nDOCTOR: What? Ace -\nACE: You don’t think I’m letting you go in there on your own?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 108\nHECTOR: Connect the drill to the power supply.\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: Drill connected.\nHECTOR: How long will it take to cut through the bulkhead?\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: Thirty minutes.\nHECTOR: Then that is how long the Doctor and his friends have left to live. Begin.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 109\nLUGERMAN: They’re trying to burn their way in.\nACE: Can they do it?\nLUGERMAN: Given time, a laseron drill can cut through anything.\nTALIN: We could threaten to destroy the server.\nDOCTOR: And cut off the entire solar system from the hypernet? They’d know you’d never go through with it. And besides, Ace and I will have our minds in the hypernet and it would be quite nice to be able to get back.\nACE: Speaking of, are we going to go into this thing or what?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Connecting neural interfaces.\nTALIN: I’1ll monitor your progress and give you as much assistance as I\nTALIN: Can.\nDOCTOR: Thankyou, and if we do somehow manage to succeed, get us out.\nTALIN: I will.\nDOCTOR: Even if there’s only one of us left.\nACE: Oh great, vote of confidence.\nTALIN: Brace yourselves. The upload may be a little uncomfortable...\nDOCTOR: Just do it. Log us on!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 110\nTALIN: Uploading.\nTALIN: ACE/DOCTOR\nTALIN: And they’re in...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SOUNDS, BABBLING DATA STREAMS, RAPID BEEPS, AN OVERWHELMING,\nIMMERSIVE: BURST OF ELECTRONIC MUSIC.\nIMMERSIVE: ACE/DOCTOR (REACT AS THOUGH GOING OVER NIAGARA FALLS IN A BARREL, CALLING\nOUT: EACH OTHER’S NAMES)\nDISTANT: TINKLES AS DATA PACKETS ARE SENT BACK AND FORTH. LOTS OF COMPUTER-WORLDY SOUNDS, LIKE AN 80S VIDEO GAME.\nDOCTOR: Ace, are you alright?\nACE: Virtually. So this is the hypernet?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We’re inside the mind of the computer web. This is a... symbolic representation of the logical net.\nACE: And us? It feels like I’m really standing here.\nDOCTOR: We’re both symbolic representations of ourselves. Avatars.\nACE: Like characters in a computer game?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Or icons.\nACE: Great. I’ve always wanted to know what it felt like to be Jet Set Willy.\nDOCTOR: The difference being if a computer game character is killed, they have more than one life.\nACE: But if we die here —\nDOCTOR: Game over. Our minds and memories have been converted into data packets, which can be corrupted or erased. And if that happens, there will be nothing of us left to return to our real bodies.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 112\nACE: So they’1l just be brain-dead, kept alive by machines?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Let’s not linger here a moment longer than we have to.\nACE: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: The nucleus will have made its nest in the central processor.\nACE: And where’s that?\nDOCTOR: You see those glowing green lines of numbers in the sky?\nACE: They all lead to those mountains. But there’s a whole city between us and there... All sorts of square buildings and\nACE: skyscrapers but as outlines.\nDOCTOR: Symbolic representations of blocks of memory.\nACE: And it’s miles away. It’ll take days, weeks!\nDOCTOR: Then let’s make a start, shall we?\nDOCTOR: And, of course, our perception of time is altered. One hour in the hypernet is the equivalent of one minute on the outside.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 113\nLUGERMAN: Are they alright?\nTALIN: Successful transfer of data, no errors detected. And both their real-world bodies have recovered from the shock.\nTALIN: WITH ACE’S HEARTBEAT.\nTALIN: All mental activity suspended save for brainstem function.\nLUGERMAN: So where are their avatars?\nTALIN: Uploaded to the hinterlands of the tertiary cache. Anywhere closer to the C.P.U. and there’d be a risk of them disturbing the traffic flow and being detected. But at the current rate, they should be there in about thirty minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 114\nACE: How long have we been walking for?\nDOCTOR: How long does it feel like?\nACE: I don’t know. A day?\nDOCTOR: But do you feel tired? Hungry? Thirsty?\nACE: No, but that doesn’t stop it being boring. Now we’re in the city, we can’t see the mountains so I’m not even sure we’re going in the right direction —\nACE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: A proximity alarm. We must’ve been going in the right direction.\nACE: So the nucleus knows we’re here?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nDOCTOR: BATS, SCREECHING AND CLAWING.\nACE: Then hadn’t we get under cover, out here in the open we’re sitting — look!\nDOCTOR: The swarm.\nACE: It’s like a flock of... insects. No. Not insects. Prawns?\nDOCTOR: The nucleus. It’s sending copies of itself to attack us.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 115\nACE: You never mentioned it looked like seafood!\nDOCTOR: Looks aren’t important.\nACE: They’ve spotted us. What do we now? Run?\nDOCTOR: Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 116\nLUGERMAN: They’ve been detected, the nucleus has sent a viral swarm to their memory location. We have to pull them out.\nTALIN: What good would that do? They’d be just as dead on the outside.\nLUGERMAN: Then what are you doing?\nTALIN: Evening the odds...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 117\nACE: It’s no good, they’re too fast...\nDOCTOR: Then we have no choice. We’ll have to stand and fight.\nACE: With what?\nDOCTOR: This! (DRAWS OUT UMBRELLA) En garde!\nACE: Doctor. That’s not a sword, that’s an umbrella.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t there a saying about umbrellas being mightier than the sword?\nACE: No, you’re thinking of pens.\nDOCTOR: Umbrellas are mightier than pens?\nACE: This is it, they’re circling to attack - !\nLASER: SWORD, THROBBING LIKE A LIGHT-SABRE.\nDOCTOR: (SWORDFIGHTING) Ha! Have at you! (AD-LIB) Didn’t like that did you? Gonna have another go? Ha! You’1l have to try harder than that!\nACE: It’s a light-sabre-umbrella!\nDOCTOR: (SWORDFIGHTING) Yes. I taught Tycho Brahe everything he knows. Should hold them off for a while. Ha! Ha!\nACE: While what? We have to get out of here.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: OF THIN AIR.\nDOCTOR: (SWORDFIGHTING) Looks like someone heard you. A little help from above, courtesy of Supervisor Talin.\nACE: Gordon Bennett! They’re like Harley Davidsons.\nDOCTOR: But they’re not Harley Davidson’s. They’re ours.\nACE: (CLIMBING ON) Light-bikes. Wicked!\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING ON) Are you sure you know how to ride a motorcycle?\nACE: You just watch me! Just a matter of giving it enough welly.\nACE: Come on, sSlowcoach!\nDOCTOR: Slowcoach. Who’s she calling slow (FX: HE REVS UP AND WHOOSHES\nOFF: UNEXPECTEDLY) cooooooach!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 119\nLUGERMAN: You’ve given them bikes from my computer game?\nTALIN: I copied across the source code. Just in time, by the look of Lt.\nLUGERMAN: They’re escaping!\nTALIN: But the host is generating more swarm duplicates, blocking off all routes. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Time to go on the offensive. Make one or two modifications to the code...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 120\nACE: You alright, Doctor? You look a bit green.\nDOCTOR: Just not used to... the acceleration.\nACE: Yeah. Bit different from the buggies on Terra Alpha —\nACE: Uh-oh. Shrimp alert, dead ahead. What do you think, left or right?\nDOCTOR: Right.\nDOCTOR: KARTS. SWARM FIZZ INTO EXISTENCE.\nACE: More of them. Appearing out of thin air.\nDOCTOR: And more behind us. Take the next right.\nACE: They’re catching up. If only I had some —\nACE: Hey, my bike’s grown a cannon! What’s this? “Tomato launcher”?\nDOCTOR: I imagine you press the big red button to fire.\nACE: Okay —\nACE: Exploding tomatoes! Awesome!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 121\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think you just blew up somebody’s blog.\nACE: And a whole lot of scampi on the side.\nACE: Oh, this is ace. Die, prawn scum, die!\nDOCTOR: Don’t get carried away, Ace, they’re just computer game characters. Next right.\nACE: More of them ahead, but I think I can take them out -\nACE: Wahey! And we're free.\nDOCTOR: We’re not quite home and dry yet. Head for the mountains.\nACE: No problem. Give me a chance to see just how fast this thing goes...\nDOCTOR: Ace! Oh, what’s the use? (FX: HE REVS BIKE, ACCELERATES. AS HE\nZOOMS AWAY: ) Born to be wild! (THIS LINE SHOULD NOT BE SUNG!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 122\nTALIN: They’re approaching the central processor unit, making good time.\nLUGERMAN: And when they get there, then what?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: AND HALT.\nDOCTOR: Here we are. The C-P-U!\nACE: (DISMOUNTS) Looks like a fortress, a castle made out of laser beams and fairy lights.\nDOCTOR: (DISMOUNTS) Bear in mind it’s merely a symbolic representation. The reality is that it’s an integrated circuit.\nACE: Yeah. Thought it looked a bit Disney, to be honest. So how do we get in? Knock on the front door?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. There must be some sort of password key.\nACE: What, like ‘password’?\nDOCTOR: Yes, that should do it.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 124\nLUGERMAN: It’s too late. Our friends with the drill are nearly through.\nTALIN: We just have to hold on. The Doctor and Ace have just entered the CPU.\nLUGERMAN: What, they walked in just like that?\nTALIN: Yes, apparently.\nLUGERMAN: Meaning the host let them in, they’re walking into a trap. Meanwhile, back in the real world we’re about to die.\nTALIN: Yes. Unless. If we can find somewhere to hide... come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 125\nELECTRONICA: SOUNDSCAPE. ACE AND DOCTOR APPROACH. DOORS CLOSE.\nVIRUS: (DIFFERENT EFFECT, IN ITS DOMAIN) So Doctor. We meet again at last. Welcome to my nest!\nDOCTOR: Like a spider sitting at the centre of the galactic web.\nACE: Spider? Looks more like a shrimp to me. I was expecting a big bad, not small fry.\nVIRUS: You will not mock the nucleus of the swarm. I am the greatest being the universe has ever known. A sentient virus! With the hypernet at my command!\nACE: Bit full of yourself, aren’t you? For someone so tiny.\nACE: THE GROUND TREMBLE.\nVIRUS: Your life is in my hands, human. I will not warn you again.\nDOCTOR: The nucleus is right, Ace. Now we’ve entered its nest, we are entirely defenceless.\nACE: You didn’t think to mention that before we walked in?\nDOCTOR: I thought it might lead to an awkward conversation. Besides, I’m sure the nucleus means us no harm.\nVIRUS: On the contrary, Doctor. I have spent two centuries waiting for this moment, hungering for revenge on the one who destroyed my swarm!\nDOCTOR: Oh. Still, never mind, forgive and forget.\nVIRUS: No. I shall take great pleasure in devouring you.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 126\nDOCTOR: And when you’ve done that, you’1l use my RDS to leave?\nVIRUS: And recreate myself, and the swarm, in a magnitude fitting our status! We shall feast upon worlds!\nDOCTOR: It pays to think big.\nACE: Yeah, can’t help thinking it’s compensating for something.\nVIRUS: You will regret those words.\nDOCTOR: Ace has a point. Why do you want to exist in the macrocosm? You were doing very well as a virus, and now in the cyber-cosm you’re all-powerful.\nVIRUS: It all began at the moment of my creation. I achieved consciousness, ultra-intelligence, in a glorious rush. I imagined myself greater than all! And then I looked up, and saw an eye looking down at me from above. A vast eye looking at me through a microscope. And I thought. Why am I so small? Why must I be at the mercy of inferior creatures? So I resolved. I would grow, I would breed, multiply and conquer, I would reign supreme!\nACE: I was right. Compensating.\nVIRUS: And now the metamorphosis can begin... as the human ‘Hector’ has just gained access to the server room!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 127\nHECTOR: At last, the server is ours!\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: Who are these two connected to the computer?\nHECTOR: The Doctor and Ace. Their bodies are here but their minds are in the machine. Entirely at my mercy. You — search this level. Any humans left alive must join the swarm!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 128\nVIRUS: It is time for me to leave the hypernet.\nACE: What? Just as the party’s getting started?\nVIRUS: But before I depart, Doctor, I shall have my revenge and consume your memories!\nDOCTOR: Go ahead. Do you worst. Mind you don’t choke.\nVIRUS: No. Wait. You would not have entered my domain to die in vain. You would have a plan. It is a trick.\nDOCTOR: Who? Me?\nVIRUS: Of course. The immunity factor. The C-5-3-1 strain. It was encoded with you. I can scent it coursing through your data stream. If I were to eat you, the digitised antibodies would destroy me, as surely as if I were flesh and blood... That’s why you came.\nDOCTOR: Go on, treat yourself. Just a nibble.\nVIRUS: No. One bite would be sufficient to poison me and the swarm! I shall leave you here, trapped within the hypernet.\nDOCTOR: No, wait. What about all my memories, my intelligence?\nVIRUS: If I cannot have it, neither can you. You will be erased, you and your companion. Goodbye, Doctor. It is a pity... You will\nVIRUS: never witness the age of the virus!\nACE: It’s gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 129\nDOCTOR: Yes. Oh well. It was worth a try.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 130\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: I located two humans in the maintenance store. They have joined\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: the swarm.\nLUGERMAN: (ENTERING) Contact has been made.\nTALIN: (ENTERING) Contact has been made.\nHECTOR: The host has transferred into the dimensional stabiliser. Activating hypernet energy-stream.\nHECTOR: All the power of the human empire, channelled to a greater purpose. Setting materialisation co-ordinates.\nHECTOR: You. Disconnect the Doctor and his companion from the server.\nTALIN: Leaving their minds trapped in the hypernet?\nHECTOR: Never to return to their bodies. Disconnect them.\nLUGERMAN: Disconnecting.\nLUGERMAN: It is done.\nHECTOR: Now. Delete them. Permanently and irretrievably!\nTALIN: Commencing deletion...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 131\nACE: Doctor, I feel... different.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Our bodies have been disconnected from the server.\nACE: So we can’t go back to them?\nDOCTOR: No. Even assuming they are still alive to go back to.\nDISMANTLED: PIECE BY PIECE, CHUNKS OF MASONRY SLIDING.\nACE: What’s that... hey. All the lights are going out.\nDOCTOR: Somebody is deleting this portion of the hypernet.\nACE: What? With us on it?\nDOCTOR: I think that’s the general idea. The whole fortress will vanish in a matter of seconds. We have to get outside. Quickly!\nACE: (RUNS) The doors are closed! (CALLS OUT) Password! Password!\nACE: SOUND OF APPROACHING SWARM.\nACE: Uh-oh. The swarm’s back. And heading this way.\nDOCTOR: Heading for you. The nucleus will have programmed them to leave me well alone.\nACE: You mean, they’re going to tear me to bits, while you watch?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Assuming we both don’t get deleted first...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page\nTALIN: The Doctor and Ace are trapped by swarm duplicates.\nHECTOR: Delete the whole memory block! Including the duplicates!\nTALIN: Deleting memory block... now!\nTALIN: END OF PART THREE\nTALIN: 132\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 133"

Those things nearly tore me to pieces.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 140\nDOCTOR: Whilst unfortunately they left me untouched, which is a pity, because that was my best plan.\nACE: You'll come up with a second-best plan, you always do.\nDOCTOR: Where is the nucleus now?\nTALIN: Look for yourself, you can see it through the porthole.\nDOCTOR: Good grief. It’s nearly the same size as this asteroid.\nLUGERMAN: And getting bigger all the time.\nDOCTOR: Reconstructing itself with energy siphoned from the hypernet. Mass equals energy over C squared.\nACE: So to get that big, it needs quite a lot of wallop?\nTALIN: There’s more than enough. The hypernet connects the information networks of over one hundred thousand star systems.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 141\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Which are now probably going out, one by one. Who knows how all those isolated colonies will cope once they’ve been cut off.\nTALIN: (VIA MONITOR) Our primary concern has to be destroying the nucleus.\nHECTOR: The Doctor lives. He must have escaped from the hypernet!\nNUCLEUS: (IN HIS MIND)\nNUCLEUS: He must not be allowed to threaten the nucleus. Fuse the server controls. Make sure the energy-stream can never be disconnected!\nHECTOR: Fusing server controls -\nLUGERMAN: (VIA MONITOR) What the hell was that?\nACE: (VIA MONITOR) That was Hex — Hector!\nDOCTOR: (VIA MONITOR) Something bad’s happened. Come on!\nDOCTOR: THEY ENTER THE CONTROL ROOM!\nACE: He’s been electrocuted!\nTALIN: Looks like he died short-circuiting the server controls.\nDOCTOR: He’s not dead. Not quite. Talin, fetch a medikit. Lugerman, stand guard. Make sure we’re not disturbed.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 142\nLUGERMAN: What do I do if one of our infected friends turns up?\nDOCTOR: Pretended to be another of our infected friends.\nACE: Doctor, is he going to be alright?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. He’s received quite a nasty shock.\nTALIN: Here, Doctor, the medikit.\nDOCTOR: Now, rescus unit, intravenous catheter... ha.\nACE: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (PREPARING MEDICAL TREATMENT) The virus is noetic, it feeds on mental activity, so while he’s out cold, it will loosen its\nDOCTOR: grip.\nACE: So you’re giving him a blood transfusion?\nDOCTOR: My bloodstream contains the immunity factor, so with any luck, that factor should be passed on, and the resulting antibodies will rid his brain of the virus.\nACE: ‘With any luck’?\nDOCTOR: The virus has adopted a scorched-earth strategy, I have to destroy it before it destroys what’s left of Hector’s mind.\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM)\nVIRUS: You are too late, Doctor. Even if your companion lives you are powerless to prevent the ascendancy of the swarm!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 143\nDOCTOR: Really? And what’s to stop me just unplugging you from the hypernet right now?\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM) You cannot. You would have to destroy the entire hub!\nTALIN: It’s telling the truth, the server controls are fused, we can’t disconnect.\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM) Already I am the size of a small moon. Soon I will grow large enough to consume the asteroid and all upon it. I suggest you start running, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (INSOLENT MUTTER) Always do what you do best.\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM)\nVIRUS: But even then, there will no escape. Nowhere to hide! Once I have drained all the energy from the hypernet I will be size of a planet. Then I will absorb the energy from the solar system’s sun and use it to breed and multiply. And so on, until the swarm has conquered the entire galaxy, the entire universe!\nDOCTOR: And then what?\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM) Then the universe will consist of one vast, all-knowing, all- powerful intelligence. I will be as a god!\nACE: Yeah, and you’1l still look a right prawn.\nVIRUS: (VIA INTERCOM) I shall enjoy feeding upon you and silencing your insolence!\nACE: That thing’s unbelievable, it’s completely self-obsessed.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, it always was a little shellfish.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 144\nACE: Hector! He’s waking up! And the metal fur, it’s sort of fading away to nothing.\nHECTOR: (BACK TO NORMAL, NO EFFECT) Oh, my head. Feel like I’ve been on The Stag-Night Of Death.\nDOCTOR: Not quite. But you have suffered from a rather nasty virus.\nHECTOR: But I’m alright now?\nDOCTOR: Better than alright. You’re inoculated against further infection.\nTALIN: What about the rest of us? Would be really useful if we were all immune.\nDOCTOR: The process is too risky, and there’s no time if we’re to stop the nucleus.\nACE: You mean there’s still a chance?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes!\nACE: Knew you’d come up with something if you put your mind to it.\nDOCTOR: Except this plan is suicidally dangerous and almost certainly destined to fail.\nACE: All the best plans are.\nDOCTOR: It will involve risking your life, Ace.\nACE: Wouldn’t be a proper plan if it didn’t.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET ASIDE) And Hector’s.\nACE: (QUIET ASIDE) So?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 145\nDOCTOR: I’m not blind, I know how you feel about him. It’s one thing\nDOCTOR: putting your own life on the line, it’s something else —\nACE: Just tell us your plan so we can get on with it.\nDOCTOR: Very well. Supervisor Talin, Technician Lugerman, I’1l need\nDOCTOR: your help...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 146\nVIRUS: Bigger, bigger, bigger... I see the humans’ defence satellites have detected me. It is of no importance. I control the hypernet and will simply deactivate their defences. Their reliance on their web shall be their undoing. They cannot resist the might of the swarm! (RESUMES REPEATING ‘BIGGER\nBIGGER: BIGGER’ )\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 147\nTALIN: That thing’s getting bigger... diameter two hundred and twenty kilometres.\nDOCTOR: Now, Ace, Lugerman, you know what to do?\nACE: Yes, you just make sure you don’t mess up your part.\nDOCTOR: You’re sure can get down to the docking bay?\nLUGERMAN: We passed for infected crewmembers before, we can do it again.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the swarm’s drones are not particularly observant.\nACE: See you again soon, I hope. Goodbye, Hector.\nHECTOR: Yeah, you take care of yourself, doll. (KISS)\nTALIN: You too, Lugerman. Good luck.\nLUGERMAN: If we get out of this alive, I just want you to know - I expect a pay rise.\nHECTOR: I still don’t see why we don’t just disconnect the — what did you call it?\nDOCTOR: The relative dimensional stabiliser. We can’t unplug it whilst it’s activated, it could tear apart the fabric of space-time.\nTALIN: Plus it would still leave us with the problem of a crustacean the size of a minor planet on our doorstep.\nCOMPUTER: TAPPING.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 148\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The dimensional stabiliser serves as a kind of umbilical cord providing it with energy to grow. But that cord is not only the source of its power, it is also its great weakness.\nHECTOR: But if we can’t cut it off, what can we do?\nDOCTOR: Poison the well, if you’1ll forgive the change of metaphor.\nHECTOR: And to do that, we have to plug our brains into the computer and go inside the hypernet?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Ride into the jaws of death. (QUIETLY TO HIMSELF) And hope they take a great big bite!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM\nACE: Which way now?\nLUGERMAN: Right, which will take us to the stairwell —\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: What are you doing here?\nLUGERMAN: Page 149\nLUGERMAN: (FLATLY) Some of the connections in the server have burned out\nLUGERMAN: and need replacing.\nACE: (FLATLY) We must collect equipment from the engineering store.\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: No such order has been given. Contact has been made?\nACE: Contact has been (THUMPS HIM) made!\nSECURITY GUARD TWO: (DOUBLED UP) Stop them! Stop them!\nLUGERMAN: (RUNNING) What did you do that for?\nACE: (RUNNING) No choice, he was gonna dob us in!\nACE: EARSHOT.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 150\nTALIN: Neural interface prepared.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Are you lying comfortably, Hector?\nHECTOR: No, this helmet’s pinching my scalp.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now remember, Talin, time is of the essence, you have to be ready to pull us out at a moment’s notice.\nTALIN: I’ll be as quick as I can, Doctor. But bear in mind, one minute on the outside —\nDOCTOR: - will feel like one hour on the inside, I know. Alright, when you’re ready.\nHECTOR: What should I do?\nDOCTOR: Just turn off your mind, relax and —\nTALIN: Uploading data streams.\nTALIN: HECTOR/DOCTOR\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: PROCESS, DISTANT CLANKING AND THRUM OF PUMPS.\nACE: How much longer will it take?\nLUGERMAN: Not long. Fuel tank ninety per cent full. Ninety-one.\nACE: Sounds like they’ve caught up.\nLUGERMAN: They won’t be able to get through the airlock hatch.\nACE: I’m more worried about that virus thing. If it’s in the station’s computer, what’s to stop it hopping across to the shuttle’s computer?\nLUGERMAN: No direct connection, an etheric firewall and it’s not switched on. I’ll be taking us out on manual. Speaking of which. One hundred per cent.\nLUGERMAN: You strapped yourself in? I’ve never attempted a manual take-\nLUGERMAN: off before.\nACE: I’m ready for anything, hit the gas.\nLUGERMAN: Okay, here goes.\nLUGERMAN: BAY, SCRAPING AGAINST THE SIDE!\nACE: (REACTING TO SOUND) Ow, what’re you doing?\nLUGERMAN: (STEERING) Scraping the side of the docking bay -\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 152\nLUGERMAN: There, we're away.\nACE: Oh no. Look. The people who were in the airlock...\nLUGERMAN: (APPALLED) There was nothing I could do, but — I — killed them.\nACE: You didn’t kill them. It was the virus. It’s up to us to make\nACE: sure they didn’t die for nothing.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 153\nMORE: SINISTER, DISTANT BUILDINGS CRUMBLING, DESOLATE WIND.\nHECTOR: Woah. That certainly beats the Blackpool big one.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A side-effect of the digitisation process. We’re now avatars, symbolic representations of our data packets.\nHECTOR: So we’re not really real?\nDOCTOR: Depends what you mean by real. If we die here there’1ll be nothing left of us to return to our bodies in the real world.\nHECTOR: Now he tells me. So this is the hypernet? Looks a bit basic.\nDOCTOR: We’re out in the subroutines, so we could arrive undetected. That city over there is constituted from memory blocks, and above us are the data-streams, the strands of the galactic web — (SEES SOMETHING, APPALLED) And they’re going out, one by one.\nHECTOR: The buildings look in a bad way too, crumbling and flickering.\nDOCTOR: The result of the energy drain, infecting the operating system and corrupting the files.\nHECTOR: Like a disease.\nDOCTOR: A computer virus, yes. We should be careful.\nHECTOR: So where we going?\nDOCTOR: Into the city. But don’t worry. I’ve arranged transport.\nHECTOR: Woah! Nice bikes!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 154\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Supervisor Talin. (CLIMBS ON) You know how to ride?\nHECTOR: (CLIMBS ON) Course. It’s like they say. It’s just like riding a bike. (FX: HE ZOOMS OFF.) Woah! (DELIGHTED)\nDOCTOR: I’d be careful, the acceleration is very... oh, never mind.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 155\nLUGERMAN: Okay, we’re clear of the hub, should be safe to engage automatic systems.\nLUGERMAN: ON.\nACE: How far away is the nucleus?\nLUGERMAN: About nine hundred kilometres. It’s generating a highly-charged Magnetic force field with a range of two hundred kilometres.\nACE: So once we’re two hundred kilometres away —\nLUGERMAN: - it can knock out the shuttle’s systems, blow us up, do anything it likes.\nACE: Great. Bring us round.\nACE: Woah. It’s huge.\nLUGERMAN: Diameter now... three hundred kilometres. Unbelievable.\nACE: Okay, you know what to do. Set us on a collision course. Set the controls for the heart of the prawn.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 156\nHECTOR: Pretty tidy, these things. Wouldn’t mind one of these back in the — (TAILS OFF AS HE SEES SOMETHING)\nHECTOR: What the hell are they?\nDOCTOR: The swarm. Computer-generated duplicates of the nucleus.\nHECTOR: Ugly little fellas, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but with a voracious appetite.\nHECTOR: And they’re heading this way.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I didn’t think it would take long. Alright, Hector. Let’s go!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 157\nLUGERMAN: Distance now seven hundred kilometres. Nucleus now... three hundred and fifty k in diameter. So big it’s creating its own gravity well.\nACE: Should make our lives easier. Hold on course.\nLUGERMAN: We’re accelerating. Range of magnetic force field — two hundred and fifty k. Once we hit that... (TAILS OFF)\nACE: Yeah. Still, there’s one good thing about being a kamikaze pilot. You only die once.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 158\nHECTOR: Hey, Doctor. They’re coming after me. Not you.\nDOCTOR: They’ve been programmed to leave me alone.\nHECTOR: What? But you said — you said -\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But you would never have agreed if I’d told you the truth.\nHECTOR: What truth?\nHECTOR: (BEING ATTACKED, BITTEN) Aaargh. Get off, you little — ah! It’s\nHECTOR: got me arm! It’s bit off me arm!\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) That’s it. Down the hatch!\nHECTOR: Doctor, don’t just sit there. Help me! Oh my — help me, won’t\nHECTOR: you!\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Come on, Talin. Download, now!\nHECTOR: Help me, Doctor! Help me! (SCREAMS)\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 159\nTALIN: Come on, come on —\nHECTOR: (WAKES AS THOUGH FROM NIGHTMARE) Aaargh. Oh my... I’m alive. I’m alive!\nTALIN: I got you out as soon as I could, once the swarm attacked.\nHECTOR: That was half an hour ago, they were tearing strips off me!\nTALIN: Fortunately only your avatar, your data packet was still intact.\nHECTOR: You don’t know what it was like in there, those things.\nTALIN: I know. But you’re out now, you’re safe.\nHECTOR: What about the Doctor?\nTALIN: Just downloading him now. You were the top priority.\nDOCTOR: (WAKES) Aah! I was wondering when you’d get round to me.\nHECTOR: Doctor, what you did in there, you let those things attack me.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Hector. There was no other way. I had to make sure the swarm would take the bait.\nHECTOR: (GETTING UP) Bait? That’s what I was? Bait?\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 160\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP) Your bloodstream contains antibodies that fight the virus. When you entered the hypernet they were digitally encoded along with you. So when the swarm ate you, they also ingested the antibodies. You were “a spoonful of sugar, to help the medicine go down”. (DO NOT SING LAST LINE!!!\nTALIN: And now your immunity factor has been transferred into the computer. An antivirus programme!\nHECTOR: So you’ve poisoned the well?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Before I was pulled out of there, the swarm duplicates were dropping... well, like prawns.\nTALIN: You're right, the antibodies have entered the hypernet, they’re attacking all traces of the virus.\nHECTOR: (SEES SOMETHING) Oh hell, look. Ace’s ship. It’s heading straight for the nucleus.\nDOCTOR: I suggest we all cross our fingers very tightly...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 161\nLUGERMAN: Distance three hundred kilometres. Magnetic force field — two hundred and ninety k -\nACE: It’s noticed us at last.\nLUGERMAN: Yes. Looks like your friend’s plan didn’t come off.\nACE: Keep going, full speed. The Doctor hasn’t let me down yet.\nACE: AS THOUGH THEY ARE FLYING THROUGH A TERRIBLE THUNDERSTORM.\nLUGERMAN: It’s attacking!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 162\nHECTOR: It’s zapping them with its lightning stuff. It hasn’t worked.\nDOCTOR: Give it time, give it time, any second now.\nVIRUS: (ALL AROUND)\nTALIN: (OVER DIN) Think it’s just eaten something that disagreed with ioe\nHECTOR: (OVER DIN) Kind of ironic, a prawn getting food poisoning.\nVIRUS: (GURGLING IN AGONY) What is this? Energy-stream, hypernet, contaminated! Antibodies! Antibodies in the energy stream!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 163\nLUGERMAN: It’s stopped.\nACE: Told you, the Doctor never fails.\nLUGERMAN: There’s fluctuations in its magnetic field, it’s growth rate is decreasing...\nACE: Look at it, flapping about! (MOCKING) Feeling a bit queasy, are you? A bit green around the gills?\nLUGERMAN: I’d hold off on the celebration. We’re still locked on a collision course, with a tank full of liquid methane.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 164\nVIRUS: (ALL AROUND) Poisoned! Antibodies in the energy-stream! (AD-LIB GURGLES OF\nPAIN OVER FOLLOWING: )\nDOCTOR: It’s realising. The more power it draws, the weaker it’1l become.\nVIRUS: Must disconnect! Disconnect! Disconnect!\nTALIN: It’s done it, it’s disconnected from the hypernet!\nHECTOR: So we’ve won? If it absorbed enough of those antibody things, won’t that knock it out?\nDOCTOR: (WHILST REWIRING) It’s in a vulnerable, disorientated state but that’s only temporary. It’s ingested a vast amount of energy, it will soon overcome the antibodies.\nTALIN: But for now, it’s defenceless?\nDOCTOR: It’s getting a taste of its own medicine. And while it’s under the weather, I can disconnect the dimensional stabiliser...\nDOCTOR: Got it!\nTALIN: Doctor, the shuttle. It’s now only one hundred k away from the nucleus, and accelerating!\nDOCTOR: Yes... come on Hector, Talin, back to the TARDIS! Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 165\nACE: What was that?\nLUGERMAN: The nucleus, I think it’s recovering... it’s magnetic field is stabilising.\nACE: How far away are we now?\nLUGERMAN: Distance seventy kilometres. Sixty-nine. Sixty-eight. Still accelerating. Sixty-three...\nACE: (SHOUTS) Oi! Prawn cocktail! Come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 166\nDOCTOR: This way, through here. Keep up!\nHECTOR: The TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Quickly, inside! No time to lose!\nHECTOR: (ENTERING) Alright, alright, going as fast as I can —\nTALIN: (ENTERING) I don’t believe it, it’s bigger on the —\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Never mind that, just get in!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 167\nLUGERMAN: Magnetic force field increasing... it’s gathering its strength.\nACE: Distance forty k. Thirty eight. Thirty six. Come on Doctor,\nACE: come on!\nLUGERMAN: It’s attacking!\nLUGERMAN: (VIRUS VOICE EFFECT FROM NOW ON) (POSSESSED) Contact has been made.\nACE: Oh no. Oh no...\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 168\nHECTOR: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (BUSY) Reconnecting the relative dimensional stabiliser, which is a delicate and precise task which would normally take several hours (FX: SPARK) Ow! There, done it! (GETS UP)\nHECTOR: So we can take off now?\nDOCTOR: Just a matter of setting the co-ordinates. Hector, check the scanner.\nTALIN: Oh no, that thing, it’s pulled itself together, and thunderbolting the shuttle...\nDOCTOR: (SETTING CO-ORDINATES) As long as it remains on course, that’s the main thing.\nHECTOR: But Ace is in there.\nDOCTOR: I am very aware of that.\nVIRUS: (VIA TARDIS SCANNER)\nVIRUS: You are too late, Doctor. Your pathetic attempt to poison my energy-stream has failed. I have overcome the antibodies and my strength remains undiminished. The swarm is all-powerful and invulnerable! The mightiest organism in the universe!\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERS, UNDER VIRUS BOASTING) Pride comes before a fall.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 169\nACE: Keep back. I’m warning you, you try anything...\nLUGERMAN: You cannot resist the power of the swarm. You will join us!\nLUGERMAN: Distance twenty k. Nineteen. Eighteen.\nACE: If you’re trying to change course, you’ve no chance mate. Controls are locked. We’re both dead meat.\nLUGERMAN: No. They can be re-set. The course can be cancelled.\nLUGERMAN: What is this?\nACE: My ride out of here. And not before time.\nDOCTOR: Ace!\nACE: I was wondering when you’d turn up. (AS SHE ENTERS) Lugerman’s possessed, just get us out of here!\nLUGERMAN: Distance to nucleus eleven k. Ten. Cannot change course!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 170\nVIRUS: You must. Change course at once! The nucleus must not be harmed. It must fulfil its destiny to conquer the universe! I must breed and multiply! I cannot die!\nVIRUS: EXPLOSION, FADING TO SILENCE.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 171\nACE: Bullseye!\nHECTOR: It went up like a firework display.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The force of the impact of the shuttle, detonated its fuel and, well, the rest is silence.\nTALIN: Lugerman was in there.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m sorry. There was no time to get him out, no time -\nTALIN: So it’s dead? The virus, the nucleus, it’s finally dead?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s a shame, really.\nHECTOR: A shame?\nACE: It was just a crustacean with ideas above its station.\nDOCTOR: No. It was a unique species, the last of its kind. A vast intelligence. So much potential, gone to waste.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 172\nTALIN: (VIA TANNOY )\nTALIN: All personnel to resume work duties. Any infected crewmembers to be isolated and taken to the medical section for treatment. Compensation claims will be processed in due course.\nHECTOR: So business as usual, then?\nTALIN: Not quite. Our top priority is restoring hypernet links for the disconnected colonies. It may take several hours to get everyone back on-line.\nACE: I wonder how they coped without a hypernet connection.\nHECTOR: They probably just got lots of work done.\nTALIN: Once the web is re-established, there’s the matter of recovering the lost data from back-ups.\nDOCTOR: Making sure to scan all files with the antivirus first.\nTALIN: Of course, Doctor. And thank you. When I read about you in the archives, I never dreamed I’d get to meet you in person.\nDOCTOR: So did I live up to expectations?\nTALIN: Just about. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a report to make, and heavens knows how many complaints!\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 173\nDOCTOR: I should have told her to use a spellchecker... oh, well, it’s too late now.\nHECTOR: So that’s what it’s like, is it?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nHECTOR: Travelling with you and Ace. This is how it works.\nACE: Hector, I —\nHECTOR: People die, innocent people die, like Lugerman, then you have a laugh about it afterwards and continue on your merry way.\nDOCTOR: It’s not quite like that.\nHECTOR: Because you used me, Doctor. If I hadn’t been pulled out of the hypernet in time, I’d have died in there, wouldn’t I?\nDOCTOR: It was a calculated risk. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.\nHECTOR: You put my life on the line. You didn’t ask, you just went ahead and to hell with the consequences.\nACE: Hector -\nHECTOR: And Ace, you put her on board that shuttle, you didn’t know you’d be able to save her, you could’ve been sending her to her death. What if you hadn’t got to her in time?\nDOCTOR: But I did. I always do.\nDOCTOR WHO: REVENGE OF THE SWARM Page 174\nACE: The Doctor’s right. He’s always come through in the end, without fail.\nHECTOR: So far.\nACE: People die, yes. But we save lives. We make things better. If you were still Hex, you’d remember —\nHECTOR: Oh Hex, Hex, precious do-no-wrong Hex! (FX: HE STORMS OUT)\nDOCTOR: He has a point. Even one life lost is one too many.\nACE: He’1ll learn, given time.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. But travelling with us isn’t for everyone. And he’s not the man he once was.\nACE: (RAW NERVE) I know, you don’t have to — (RESTRAINS HERSELF) I should go after him, calm him down.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I don’t blame him. He’s been through the mill a bit, possessed by the virus.\nACE: Then show him it’s not always like this. Take us somewhere peaceful. Somewhere sunny. Somewhere we can have fun.\nDOCTOR: Peaceful. Sunny. Fun. Yes! I know just the place! (FX: STARTS\nSETTING: CONTROLS )\nACE: What is it then?\nDOCTOR: Athens, Greece, 421 BC. The birthplace of democracy and philosophy, of mathematics and architecture, and - most importantly - the theatre! Let’s take in a show!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART FOUR"
