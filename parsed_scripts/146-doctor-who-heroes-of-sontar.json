(TO MEZZ) Stand easy, Sergeant! (TO THURR) You too, Thurr.\nTHURR: As you command, Fleet Marshal. (TOADYING) It is a signal honour to be invited to watch over the passing-out of the Academy —\nSTABB: (INTERRUPTING) No, no, can’t hear you. Louder! Louder!\nTHURR: (LOUDER) I was saying, your eminence, it is an honour to attend such a magnificent muster of Sontaran [clonelings —]\nSTABB: (IGNORING HIM) Eardrums got blown out at the battle of Jerrick- Zero. Ten billion megatons of nuclear cannon-fire — can you imagine that, Thurr?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 4\nTHURR: (A FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT HUMOUR) Why, that would have made these clonelings sound like a bunch of bawling females, sir!\nMEZZ: They are females, Field-Major.\nTHURR: What?\nMEZZ: It is said that an extra chromosome got into the mix at the breeding plant.\nTHURR: Er — what I meant to say, your eminence, is — bawling Rutan females, Fleet Marshal, sir!\nSTABB: It’s of no concern, I’m sending them to certain death in the Doghead Nebula. (BEAT; SIGH) Permission to laugh, Field-Major.\nTHURR: (STRANGLED LAUGH) Ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.\nMEZZ: That is very good, Fleet Marshal, sir —\nSTABB: I was not speaking to you, Sergeant!

The reason I have recalled you from the Gloom Moons of Aldebaran...\nTHURR: Fleet Marshal, local resistance proved far greater than our strategists anticipated —\nSTABB: Yes, yes, yes, I’ve had them destroyed.\nTHURR: (CONFUSED) The Gloom Moons, sir?\nSTABB: Your strategists, Field-Major.\nTHURR: Ha!

I, er —\nMEZZ: At the furthest reaches of the Madeleine Cluster?\nSTABB: Don’t help him, Sergeant!\nTHURR: Madeleine Cluster, oh yes.\nSTABB: The planet Samur marks the point of our great Empire’s furthest incursion into Rutan space, twenty years ago. Ever since the conquest of Samur, the Empire has concentrated its resources... further back in the Cluster.\nMEZZ: (ASIDE) Considerably further back, in fact.\nTHURR: I... understand.\nSTABB: I have a special mission for you, Field-Major. I want you to travel to Samur, immediately —\nTHURR: What, through Rutan space?\nSTABB: Immediately! (TO MEZZ) Sergeant, the canister.\nMEZZ: Here, sir. —\nSTABB: This canister is currently sealed.

MOSSY PRECINCT ON SAMUR\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING OUT) .. as I explained, Tegan, shoes, boots, slippers and footwear of all kinds are strictly forbidden within the precincts of the Citadel — (BREAKING OFF, SURPRISED BY SURROUNDINGS) ... Ah.\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING) So — what? They don’t want to ruin the carpet?\nNYSSA: That’s not carpet, Tegan.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) No. No, it’s not.\nTURLOUGH: (FX: CLOSING TARDIS DOOR BEHIND HIM) I detect from the tone of your voice that this place is not as you remember it?\nDOCTOR: (UNCONVINCED BY OWN ARGUMENT) Ah, Turlough. I suppose we might have landed in a part of the Citadel I’ve not seen before.\nNYSSA: The Citadel stretches the length of the planet, you said. There must be a lot of it.\nTEGAN: (STEPPING FORWARD) Well, what is it, if it isn’t carpet?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I shouldn’t step on that if I were you. —\nTURLOUGH: Too late.\nTEGAN: (SLIGHTLY OFF) It’s soft. Kind of... springy.\nNYSSA: It’s moss. Purple moss.\nDOCTOR: Some sort of lichen, certainly.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 8\nTEGAN: (SLIGHTLY OFF) But it stretches as far as the eye can see!\nNYSSA: Doctor, you’re concerned.\nDOCTOR: The Citadel of Samur has its own complex ecosystem. A symbiosis between the buildings and those who dwell within them.\nNYSSA: And its inhabitants would never have allowed it to become overgrown?\nDOCTOR: No, they wouldn’t.\nTURLOUGH: Well, I see no ‘inhabitants’.\nTEGAN: (RETURNING) No people at all. (BEAT) Know what this means?\nTURLOUGH: Astound us.\nTEGAN: We can wear shoes.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. CONTROL ROOM AMBIENCE. DOORS OPENING FROM THE INSIDE)\nTEGAN: (ENTERING) .. I’m sorry, but if I must go tramping around a planet-wide mould, no way am I doing it in bare feet!\nDOCTOR: (FOLLOWING) It isn’t mould, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Moss, mould, fungus, whatever — I do not want it between my toes!\nTURLOUGH: (JUST BEHIND) I’11 fetch the shoes, shall I?\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Turlough. That would be helpful, yes.\nTEGAN: Wait a minute. Where’s Nyssa?\nTURLOUGH: This moss has excited her curiosity. I think she wandered off.\nTEGAN: That woman needs to get a life. Turlough, you’d better stop her from going too far.\nTURLOUGH: Me?\nTEGAN: Like I said, I’m not stepping foot outside that door without at least a pair of slingbacks!\nTURLOUGH: (EXITING) Fine. Fine..!\nDOCTOR: (STUDYING CONSOLE READINGS) You know, this really is most peculiar.\nTEGAN: What is?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: The date. It’s only thirty years, local time, since I was last here on Samur. For the Citadel to have fallen into such a state of disrepair in less than thirty years...\nTEGAN: Yeah, it looks like no-one’s been here for centuries.\nDOCTOR: Like I say, most peculiar.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: EXT. MOSSY PRECINCT ON SAMUR\nTURLOUGH: (PADDING OVER MOSS, CALLING OUT) Nyssa? Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (OFF) Over here, Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: (FX: FOLLOW HIM AS HE WALKS OVER) Nyssa. Tegan sent me to stop you from wandering off. I see she was right to.\nNYSSA: Yes, well — I’m not the helpless young girl she thinks I am. Not any more.\nTURLOUGH: Nonetheless, I suggest we stick together.\nNYSSA: Don’t worry, I’ll look after you. (IGNORING HIM) Now — courtyard to the east, or courtyard to the west?\nTURLOUGH: Can’t we at least fetch our shoes?\nNYSSA: The others can bring them. (DETERMINED) East, I’d say. (WALKS OFF )\nTURLOUGH: (TO SELF) .. No. Evidently. (CALLING OFF) Well, wait for me. —\nTURLOUGH: (FX: EXITS. A BEAT, THEN CROSS TO TARDIS. DOOR CLOSED. TEGAN AND DOCTOR NOW IN SHOES)\nTEGAN: Well, where’d they go?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. (CALLING OUT) Nyssa? Nyssa!\nTEGAN: She can’t have gone far.\nDOCTOR: Still, we ought to stick together.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 12\nTEGAN: She’ll be fine. She’s not the precious young thing you think she is. Not any more.\nDOCTOR: I suppose Turlough’s with her.\nTEGAN: So she can look after him. (BEAT) What is it with this Citadel of yours?\nDOCTOR: I don’t follow.\nTEGAN: You were so keen to come here. Like you had some sort of agenda?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s a retreat. A chance to recharge one’s batteries, in a relaxed but nonetheless stimulating environment. People from across all of the Middle Galaxies used to come to Samur in search of — well, in search of whatever it was they came for. Sanctuary. Solace. Peace of mind.\nTEGAN: So what was it? A kibbutz? Some sort of giant hippy commune?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly, but you’re in the general area.\nTEGAN: Yeah, you’d have fitted right in. (GENTLY) I am alright, you know. After the Mara, I mean.\nDOCTOR: Good. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Now — courtyard to the east, or courtyard to the west?\nTEGAN: (PERSISTING) I don’t need a rest cure, Doctor. I don’t need to hug a tree, or sit around a campfire singing ‘Kumbayah’. What I need is to go somewhere, anywhere, that isn’t... dull.\nDOCTOR: Quite. West, I think. (WALKS OFF)\nTEGAN: (CALLING AFTER) I’1ll leave the others their shoes, shall I? (TO SELF) Unbelievable. (WALKS)\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) This isn’t one courtyard. It’s a field of courtyards! (TO STOP) Nyssa. We should go back. Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (STOPPING) These must have been sculptures, before the moss got to them.\nTURLOUGH: That, or statues. Are you coming?\nNYSSA: I should like to see what’s underneath. Do you have a pen- knife?\nTURLOUGH: Why would I have a pen-knife?\nNYSSA: You’re a boy, I thought you’d have a pen-knife.\nTURLOUGH: You’re a girl, don’t you have a — I don’t know, a nail file?\nNYSSA: (EFFORT, DIGGING INTO MOSS ROUND STATUE) I’1l just have to take it off with my fingers. (BEAT) But it’s very, very — tenacious...\nNYSSA: Turlough? Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Over here. What do you make of this?\nNYSSA: (FX: FOLLOW HER, WALKING OVER) What is it?\nTURLOUGH: (FX: RATTLING METAL FLAGPOLE) A flagpole, I think. (FX: FLAPPING CANVAS BANNERS) Two ensigns, but they’re faded.\nNYSSA: Still, it’s the only thing here that’s not been touched by the moss.\nTURLOUGH: (DRILY) That’s why I remarked upon it.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 14\nNYSSA: On the mooring, where you’re standing. I think it’s a plaque.\nTURLOUGH: (FX: STEPPING DOWN FROM MOORING) A what?\nNYSSA: A plaque. See? (READING) “In the martial year seventy-five thousand and nine, this planet, its moons and satellites were hereby claimed for the greater glory of —” (BREAKS OFF)\nTURLOUGH: The greater glory of what? What’s it say? Nyssa!\nNYSSA: “.. the greater glory of the Sontaran Empire.”\nTURLOUGH: “Sontaran”? What’s “Sontaran”?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. THURR’S SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SHIP IN FLIGHT. ALL SONTARAN TECH IS CLUNKY-, CHUNKY- SOUNDING, SO WE HEAR UNOILED, INELEGANT SWITCHES AND LEVERS; DISCORDANT FARTS FROM CONTROL PANELS, NOT DELICATE BLEEPS)\nMEZZ: (SALUTING) Ah, Field-Major! The platoon await your instructions.\nTHURR: (STEPPING THROUGH DOOR) Good, Sergeant. (STOPPED) Now — pay attention, troops. According to Pilot Bekk on the flight deck, we have now exited warpspace and will shortly be entering orbit about our objective: the planet Samur.\nCLUN: (SHARPLY, WITH RECOGNITION) Samur?!?\nJORR: Samur, did you say?\nTHURR: Yes — Samur, Trooper... er...\nMEZZ: (ASIDE) Jorr, sir.\nTHURR: . Trooper Jorr. Why, does the name Samur mean anything to you?\nJORR: No, no, sir. It just sounds like a dismal hole.\nMEZZ: That is true.\nTHURR: Well, Trooper Jorr — the planet Samur marks the point of our great Empire’s furthest incursion into Rutan space, twenty years ago.\nVEND: Field-Major! Field-Major! Do you mean, we are in Rutan space right now?\nTHURR: As a matter of fact, we are, Trooper...?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 16\nMEZZ: (ASIDE) .. Vend, sir. Passed out of the Academy only recently. Very keen.\nTHURR: Good, good. (TO VEND) Yes, Trooper Vend, we are in Rutan space right now —\nTHURR: VEND/NOLD/JORR:\nCLUN: Permission to speak, Field-Major, sir!\nTHURR: Permission granted, Corporal...?\nCLUN: Corporal Clun, Field-Major! Thirty-five years in the Sontaran service, with the scars to prove it!\nTHURR: That is highly commendable, Corporal. Did you have a question?\nCLUN: My question is, Field-Major — if we are in Rutan space, why are we going to Samur when we could be blasting Rutan scum to plasma?\nCLUN: VEND/NOLD/JORR:\nTHURR: A good question, Corporal, and one I cannot answer before we make planetfall. (FX: TAPS CANISTER AT HIS SIDE) Sealed orders, you understand.\nCLUN: But what if we meet any Rutan scum on the way? Can we blast them to plasma then?\nTHURR: Well, in the unlikely event that we should run into a Rutan patrol in orbit about Samur, then Pilot Bekk will indeed blast them to plasma. (FX: A FAINT FARTING, OFF, AS AN ALARM SIGNAL BEGINS TO THROB BEHIND THURR. IT CONTINUES, INSISTENTLY,\nTHROUGH: ) Now, any further questions? You, with your hand up.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 17\nTHURR: No, didn’t catch that, Trooper...?\nMEZZ: (ASIDE) Nold, sir.\nTHURR: . Trooper Nold. What’s the matter, Trooper? Lost your tongue?\nTHURR: What’s that?\nMEZZ: He means “Yes, sir.” He lost his tongue. Bit it clean through in a podcrash, some years ago.\nCLUN: One moment, I know how Nold speaks. (TO NOLD) Say it again, Trooper.\nTHURR: Well, what’s he say?\nCLUN: He says, have you noticed...\nCLUN: . the attack proximity indicator...\nCLUN: . is flashing!\nTHURR: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL)\nMEZZ: Page 18\nMEZZ: Behind you, sir. The attack proximity indicator appears to be\nMEZZ: flashing.\nTHURR: We are under attack?\nTHURR: (FX: MASSIVE ELECTRICAL SOUND, LIKE A THUNDERCRACK,\nTHURR: ON AND REVERBERATING AROUND THE HULL)\nTHURR: THURR/MEZZ/CLUN/JORR/VEND/NOLD:\nTHURR: Sergeant! Status?\nMEZZ: (DRY) We appear to have run into\nMEZZ: Samur.\nJORR: That dismal hole!\nJORR: (FX: A SECOND THUNDERCRACK. MORE\nVEND: (EXCITED) We’re under attack, by\nCLUN: Do not panic, boy! Do not panic!\nCLUN: a Rutan patrol in orbit\nCLUN: REVERBERATION )\nCLUN: Sontar! Under attack!\nCLUN: (URGENT) We are under\nCLUN: attack! Action stations! We are under attack!\nIMPACTING: around\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nNYSSA: As I recall, the Sontarans were the sworn enemies of the Rutans. An amoeboid species. The Doctor and I met them on Earth, in the Middle [Ages —]\nTURLOUGH: Never mind the Rutans, Nyssa — what about these Sontarans?\nNYSSA: A race of troll-like warmongers, apparently. I’ve not actually met one, mind you. But if they’re half as bad as the Rutans...\nTURLOUGH: I said, never mind your Rutans! Not if we need to be watching our backs for trolls...\nNYSSA: I see no other evidence of military occupation. But the Doctor will want to see this banner, nonetheless. I suggest we take it back to the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: At last!\nNYSSA: Here, hold this moss sample while I — (SHE CAN’T GET THE MOSS SAMPLE OFF HER HAND) .. Oh. That’s strange.\nTURLOUGH: What is?\nNYSSA: The moss. It seems to have — (EFFORT, TRYING TO FREE MOSS FROM HER HAND) .. stuck to my palm.\nTURLOUGH: Here, let me try to get it off. — (TUGS AT MOSS)\nNYSSA: (SMALL YELP. A PINPRICK OF PAIN) Ow!\nTURLOUGH: Sorry. It seems to be some kind of natural adhesive —\nNYSSA: It’s more than superglue, Turlough. I think... (BRIEF EFFORT) .. I think it’s rooted.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT. COURTYARD WEST\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: QUICK FADE UP. SOFT SQUELCHING UNDERFOOT GIVES WAY TO FOOTSTEPS ON BRITTLE STONE)\nTEGAN: (WALKING) This isn’t just one courtyard. It’s a field of courtyards! (TO STOP) Doctor. We should go back. Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Yes. Yes, I think you’re probably right. (BEAT) You know, there’s something strange about this moss.\nTEGAN: Yes. It’s purple. The same purple it was back where we left the TARDIS. The same purple that’s giving me eye strain.\nDOCTOR: The colouring’s the same, I agree — but the moss itself is much less dense here.\nTEGAN: So? Look — I’m going back, before we get ourselves lost.\nDOCTOR: One moment, Tegan, if you would. (TO SELF) I wonder... What happens if I... hup! (JUMPS HEAVILY ON THE SPOT)\nDOCTOR: Interesting. Hup! (JUMPS AGAIN) (NB: NO CRUNK THIS TIME)\nTEGAN: What are the star jumps in aid of?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, I noticed that the purple colouring has extended into the stone floor itself, even where the moss isn’t — see? And I wondered if the integrity of the stone itself might have been affected. Hence the impact test.\nTEGAN: Well, everything’s fine. Now can we please go and find the others?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s probably wise — (TURNS TO LEAVE)\nTEGAN: Did you hear that? It came from beneath our feet!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) Well, it’s probably nothing. —\nDOCTOR: (FX: BANG ON CUE — MORE CRUNKS, TO THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. CRACKING AS THE STONE FLOOR DISINTEGRATES AROUND THEM)\nTEGAN: You and your ‘impact test’! The floor’s giving way!!!\nDOCTOR: Brave heart, Tegan. It’s only a craaaaa-[ck]! (FALLS INTO CRACK)\nTEGAN: Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. THURR’S SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TWO MORE THUNDERCRACKS IN CLOSE SUCCESSION. JUDDERING, SPARKS. FARTING ALARMS )\nVEND: Another hit! And another!\nJORR: We are doomed!\nTHURR: No, no! Our shields can easily absorb this Rutan weaponry. And once their batteries are exhausted — then, then we will turn and blast them to plasma! —\nVEND: It has all gone quiet.\nTHURR: Like I said, their batteries are exhausted. Now — now I shall instruct Pilot Bekk to strike back, without mercy! (TURNS, BUT...) Strange.\nMEZZ: The door to the flight deck is not functional!\nTHURR: (FX: BANGING REPEATEDLY ON BULKHEAD WITH FIST) Pilot Bekk! Activate the flight deck door at once! (FX: BREAKS OFF) Why can he not hear me?\nJORR: That will be because he’s dead, most likely.\nTHURR: Silence, Trooper Jorr! (FX: BANGS ON DOOR AGAIN; AROUND HERE, THE SHIP BEGINS TO ACCELERATE, A WHINE FROM OUTSIDE INCREASING QUICKLY IN INTENSITY AS THE SHIP BEGINS FALLING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE OF SAMUR) Pilot! Pilot, open this door!\nJORR: Like the doors are dead. The alarms are dead. Face it, the whole ship is dead!\nTHURR: I said silence! If the ship was dead, it would be plummetting helplessly through the atmosphere of Samur —\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 23\nNOLD: (INTERRUPTS, GARGLING: “PLUMMETTING HELPLESSLY IS WHAT [WE’RE DOING, SIR!”])\nTHURR: (ROARS) I — said — silence!!!\nTHURR: (BEAT SILENCE. IN WHICH THE WHINING FROM OUTSIDE BECOMES OBVIOUS)\nCLUN: Permission to speak, Field-Major!\nTHURR: Permission granted, Corporal.\nCLUN: Trooper Nold says, plummetting helplessly through the atmosphere of Samur is what we are doing, sir!\nMEZZ: (TO THURR) Regret to inform you — Trooper Nold is correct.\nTHURR: We are Sontaran soldiers, Sergeant! We do not plummet helplessly!\nMEZZ: Then I recommend the use of gravity spheres.\nTHURR: Gravity spheres, good. (VERY LOUD, OVER HOWLING FROM OUTSIDE) Abandon ship! I order you all to abandon ship!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT. COURTYARD WEST\nTEGAN: (EFFORT, PULLING DOCTOR OUT OF CRACK IN FLOOR) Come on, Doc — put some backbone into it!\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING ON LIP OF CRACK) I have plenty of backbone, Tegan. It’s just that I’m trying very hard not to plummet helplessly to my death in the act of applying it...\nTEGAN: Yeah, down the crevasse you created! (CATCHES BREATH) Alright, one more heave. —\nTEGAN: DOCTOR/TEGAN: (BOTH STRAINING) Heeeeave! !!\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nTEGAN: So, Einstein — what do we do now, given there’s a ten-foot crevasse keeping us from the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP, DUSTING SELF DOWN) Like I said, the Citadel’s vast. I’m sure there’ll be another way round, even if we have to traverse the breadth of the planet. (BEAT) Joke.\nTEGAN: Well, I’m not laughing.\nDOCTOR: No. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Interesting, though. This moss.\nTEGAN: Not that again.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that again. Where it touches the floor directly, like here, the ground is perfectly solid. But where the ground is merely dyed, the stonework’s brittle, like it’s been weakened on the molecular level.\nTEGAN: Meaning — what?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: I have a theory.\nTEGAN: I’m not going to like this, am I?\nDOCTOR: Not a lot, no. What if the dyed, brittle ground indicates an area that the moss has already passed over...?\nTEGAN: You mean — it’s eating the floor!?!\nDOCTOR: Eating anything it roots itself to, I suspect. What’s more, it’s moving.\nTEGAN: This gets better and better.\nDOCTOR: At an incredibly slow rate, of course. But given time, I’ve no doubt it could consume the entire planet. Such an organism could never have arisen naturally.\nTEGAN: Oh, great. Attack of the Purple Astroturf!\nDOCTOR: . of the Alien Purple Astroturf, yes. (PATTING POCKETS) One moment. Somewhere here I should have...\nTEGAN: What are you looking for? Weedkiller?\nDOCTOR: (FINDING PEN-KNIFE) Ah! (FLOURISHING IT) Pen-knife.\nTEGAN: Figures. You always had a bit of the Boy Scout about you.\nDOCTOR: Well, I promise to do my best. Now — (FX: APPLYING PEN-KNIFE TO A PATCH OF MOSS; SOFT SQUELCHES) — let’s see if we can’t cut a\nDOCTOR: sample free. Taking care not to touch the underside, of course...\nTEGAN: Why?\nDOCTOR: . There, that’s got it. And I don’t want to touch the underside [because —]\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 26\nTEGAN: Uurgh, it’s moving!\nDOCTOR: Well, its roots are. Looking to anchor themselves into whatever they can find, and suck it dry atomically.\nTEGAN: You wouldn’t want that on your skin.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I imagine it’d destabilise human flesh rather sooner than it does stone. The question I have is:\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nNYSSA: (STOPPING, SLIGHTLY BREATHLESS) What happened here, I wonder?\nTURLOUGH: Never mind that now, Nyssa. We have to get back to the Doctor. The TARDIS. (BEAT) How’s the hand?\nNYSSA: See for yourself.\nTURLOUGH: (DOUBLE-TAKE) But it’s gone!\nNYSSA: Not exactly. It’s moved further up my arm — see?\nTURLOUGH: It’s moving?!?\nNYSSA: Slowly, yes.\nTURLOUGH: You mean, it’s alive?\nNYSSA: Obviously. The question is not, “Is it moving?” The question is, “Why is it moving?”\nTURLOUGH: And “Where to?”, I suppose.\nNYSSA: There’s a biotronic agitator in the TARDIS. That’d purge the infection, I’m sure.\nTURLOUGH: Best we get a move on, then.\nNYSSA: I feel weak. I could use some support, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Well, I can see it’s worrying, but I’m sure it’1ll all be alright —\nNYSSA: Not that sort of support! Your arm? (BEAT; SIGHS) You won’t catch it, I don’t think it’s done with me yet.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 28\nTURLOUGH: I wish I had your certainty. (BEAT) Alright, then. Put your arm around my [waist] — (FX: INTERRUPTED BY SONIC BOOM FROM SKY ABOVE )\nNYSSA: What was that?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. COURTYARD WEST\nTEGAN: (EXCITED) Up in the sky, Doctor! Look!\nDOCTOR: Good heavens.\nTEGAN: A shooting star! .. It’s breaking up!\nDOCTOR: Given the perfect sphericality of the parent object, and its descent trajectory... unlikely.\nTEGAN: Well, what is it, then? .. Don’t say a spaceship.\nDOCTOR: A spaceship. Sorry. And that’s not debris in its wake. Escape pods, maybe? Spherical, too. (MORE TO SELF) And terribly familiar. —\nTEGAN: The big ship’s coming down. It’s gonna [hit!]\nTEGAN: (FX: DROWNED OUT BY DEEP RUMBLING IMPACT FROM TWO MILES AWAY.\nCROSSFADE TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nTURLOUGH: (SHOULDERING NYSSA) Whatever that was, it wasn’t far away.\nNYSSA: (SHOULDERED) Two point five to three kilometres, I think.\nTURLOUGH: (SHOULDERING NYSSA) What do you suppose it was?\nNYSSA: Here we are. The TARDIS. (BEAT; REALISATION) Oh, no!\nTURLOUGH: Yes — no sign of the Doctor, or Tegan. (STEPPING FORWARD) Still, at least they left us our shoes. —\nNYSSA: That’s not it, Turlough. Look at the TARDIS!\nTURLOUGH: Moss. It’s covered in moss!\nNYSSA: Interesting. It looks like it’s trying to find a way in.\nTURLOUGH: (SLIPPING ON SHOES) Yes, fascinating. But how are we supposed to open the doors without becoming infected?\nNYSSA: Right now, I have absolutely no idea. Pass me my shoes, would you?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. TOP OF CITADEL WALL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: QUICK FADE UP. THRUMMING SONTARAN GRAVITY SPHERE COMES INTO LAND, HOVERS FOR A SECOND — THEN THUDS HEAVILY DOWN TO GROUND. BEAT)\nMEZZ: (FX: FROM INSIDE) Landfall achieved, Field-Major, sir!\nJORR: (FX: FROM INSIDE) More of a falling than a landing, it seems to us.\nTHURR: (FX: FROM INSIDE) That is enough, Trooper Jorr! (TO MEZZ) Open the exit hatch, Sergeant.\nMEZZ: (FX: FROM INSIDE) Immediately, sir.\nTHURR: (OFF, STILL INSIDE) Well? Anything to see? Report, Sergeant!\nMEZZ: We are on the battlements of a stone installation, sir. The main ship appears to have come down to the south.\nTHURR: (STOMPING OUT) Does it, now. Is it intact?\nMEZZ: I cannot see for the smoke from the crater.\nJORR: (STOMPING OUT) A dismal hole in a dismal hole.\nTHURR: Secure the area, Trooper Jorr! (FX: JORR STOMPS OFF) Now then, Sergeant — any sign of the other grav-sphere?\nMEZZ: Not that I can see.\nTHURR: Well, then — try to raise them on the comms. (BEAT) Get to it, Sergeant!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 32\nMEZZ: Orders, sir. Orders. Should they not be your first priority?\nTHURR: (D’'OH!) Orders! Yes, yes. — (BEAT) Pass me the canister, Sergeant.\nMEZZ: But — I don’t have it, sir.\nTHURR: You fool, Sergeant! You left it behind, on the main ship!\nMEZZ: You had it last, sir —\nTHURR: You are my second-in-command! It is your duty to carry out my orders, is it not?\nMEZZ: Yes, sir!\nTHURR: Well, then — why didn’t you carry them out?\nMEZZ: But —\nTHURR: Silence! You are a disgrace to the Fleet!\nMEZZ: Yes, sir. Shall I raise the other sphere now, sir?\nTHURR: You do that, Sergeant!\nMEZZ: (FX: FLIPPING COMMS: USE EFFECT IN ‘THE TIME WARRIOR’ PART ONE — LINX’S FIRST MEETING WITH IRONGRON) This is Sergeant Mezz hailing Corporal Clun. Corporal Clun, report. —\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: EXT. RAMPARTS/TOP OF CITADEL WALL\nTEGAN: (STOPPING, CALLING BACK) Oh, how many more steps? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) This is the Wall of No Division, it runs right around the planet. Carry on, Tegan. We’1ll have a much better view of our situation from up here.\nTEGAN: (RESUMES CLIMBING, AHEAD) “Wall of No Division”?\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING STEPS, BEHIND) It’s not so much a wall, more of a concept piece. One begins walking on one side of the barrier, and ends up on the other.\nTEGAN: (CLIMBING STEPS) Well, what’s the point of that?\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING STEPS) I suppose, that the wall isn’t a wall at all.\nTEGAN: (CLIMBING STEPS) A mile-high work of hippy art. Terrific.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING STEPS) If nothing else, we’ll be able to see exactly where it was that spaceship came down.\nTEGAN: (STOPPING) What, so we’re going to pick up survivors?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) I think not, in this instance.\nTEGAN: We’re not?!?\nDOCTOR: Keep going. (FX: BOTH RESUME CLIMBING) I told you, Samur was a refuge — in this case, from a rather terrible war being waged in the next galaxy along.\nTEGAN: (CLIMBING STEPS) A war? Between who?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING STEPS) A distinctly futile conflict between the Rutans and the Sontarans. Both rather belligerent species; both of whom employ spherical vessels. Best, I think, if we be on our guard.\nTEGAN: (STOPPED, AHEAD) Hey, I think I can see the top!\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING AFTER) Both species are noted for their hostility, and a general lack of interest in anything beyond the prosecution of their [interminable war. —]\nTEGAN: So, er.. do either of them look like stumpy, cross-eyed trolls?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING AT TOP) Why do you ask?\nTEGAN: ‘Cause there’s three of them behind you.\nTHURR: (FX: APPROACHING, STOMPING TO HALT) Halt, prisoners of the Sontaran Empire!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. —\nTEGAN: Sontarans, right?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. (STEPPING FORWARD) Field-Major, is it? I should like to declare that, under the terms of the Fifteenth Treaty, I, and all of my associates, must be considered non-combatants within the area of this zone, and as such exempt from martial\nDOCTOR: jurisduction. —\nJORR: Marshal Jurisdiction? Who is Marshal Jurisdiction?\nMEZZ: Our Marshal is Stabb the Unvanquished, Supreme Commander of the Ninth Sontaran Space Fleet!\nTHURR: That’s enough, Sergeant! (BEAT) You are Terrans. What do Terrans know of the Fifteenth Treaty?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR: Ah...\nTHURR: Terra is a Class C civilisation! Undeveloped!\nDOCTOR: Yes. That. Well, if you’d just let me explain. —\nTEGAN: (BUTTING IN) He’s saying, we’re time and space travellers, Shorty.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Tegan —\nTEGAN: . and if the Doctor says we’re exempt from your jurisdiction, we're exempt from your jurisdiction!\nDOCTOR: I said, thank you, Tegan!\nTHURR: “The Doctor”? (TO MEZZ) Did the female say — [“the Doctor”?!?]\nMEZZ: She did, Field-Major!\nTHURR: Then: these must have been my orders, Sergeant!\nMEZZ: No doubt about it, sir!\nTHURR: My orders: to seek out, capture and execute that sworn enemy of the Sontaran Empire — the traveller in time and space designated “Doctor”!\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) Me and my big mouth.\nDOCTOR: (TO TEGAN) Quite.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 36"

TOP OF CITADEL WALL (CONTINUOUS)\nTHURR: Trooper Jorr, Sergeant Mezz — prepare arms!\nTEGAN: Hold on a minute. You can’t just shoot us!\nTHURR: (IGNORING HER) I want to see good clean shots to the head and the heart. Think you can manage that, Trooper?\nJORR: Yes, sir!\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) Doctor, do something!\nDOCTOR: I’m working on it. (ALOUD) Better make that hearts plural, Field-Major. I’m a Time Lord — and Time Lords have two hearts, remember?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 37\nMEZZ: He has a point, sir.\nDOCTOR: Indeed I do! So: how do you want to do this — one shot each to the left and right heart, followed by the head?\nTHURR: That will do! Prepare arms!\nDOCTOR: Inefficient, however. Your plasma packs will only last so long, and presumably your ability to recharge your weapons is compromised, given that your main vessel crashed somewhere over there. Brought down by Rutans, I presume?\nMEZZ: (TO THURR) It is true. Standing orders dictate that, on a field mission, conservation of weapons energy remains a priority.\nTHURR: So I shall take the shot alone! After three. Three. Two. —\nMEZZ: Is that advisable, sir?\nTHURR: What now, Sergeant?\nMEZZ: Protocol dictates that the minimum number of Sontarans required to form an execution party is three.\nDOCTOR: Well, quite. You’re not butchers.\nTHURR: Ah, but in this instance, Sergeant, the Doctor is a viable target because... because he is attempting to evade capture!\nTEGAN: No he’s not! He’s not even tried to make a run for it! For some reason...\nMEZZ: Again, the female has a point.\nTHURR: Well — run, then, Doctor! Run!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: No, no, I think on balance I’d much sooner surrender. If it’s all the same to you.\nTHURR: (HOWL OF FRUSTRATION) Gaaah!\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Doctor, what in the name of Rolf do you think you’re playing at?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Sontarans have two weaknesses, Tegan. One is the probic vent on the backs of their necks — see?\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Oh, yeah!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) The other is their love of military protocol. And I’m guessing that the rules covering surrendered prisoners are rather more involved than those covering fugitive combatants.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Got you!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I don’t doubt that we won’t end up being executed, of course. But let’s not see if we can’t tie them in knots for a while first, hm?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: EXT.

Not with you in your (DISTASTE)\nTURLOUGH: condition. Not that any of this would matter if the Doctor gave each of us a TARDIS key, of course. Which just goes to show how much he trusts us.\nNYSSA: He’s only thinking about our safety. The TARDIS is valuable. Some people would stop at nothing to get their hands on a key.\nTURLOUGH: I suppose so.\nNYSSA: You could always go and look for them yourself, if you’re worried.\nTURLOUGH: Me?\nNYSSA: You’re not afraid, are you?\nTURLOUGH: Obviously not. But if there are troll-like warmongers about, I have to think of your safety, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Oh, the Sontarans. I suspect they long since succumbed to the moss.\nTURLOUGH: You’re sure about that?\nTURLOUGH: (FX: A FAINT CLINK OF METAL AGAINST STONE, OFF — SONTARANS ATTACHING MINE TO EXTERIOR WALL)\nNYSSA: As will I, if we don’t get into the TARDIS soon.

(FX: CROSSING FLOOR — FOLLOW HIM) Over here, beside the wall.\nNYSSA: There’s nothing there, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Behind it, I mean.

Turlough, are you alright?\nTURLOUGH: (COUGHING DUST) I told you there was something!\nCLUN: (OFF) That’s it, troopers! Forward! Forward! Up and at ‘em!\nNYSSA: What was that?\nTURLOUGH: That, I presume, was whoever blew the hole in the wall coming to get us.\nCLUN: Well, Vend? Can you see anything?\nVEND: (STOPPING, CALLING BACK) I see something, Corporal!\nVEND: Humanoidlings!\nCLUN: Forward and hold them! Hold them tight!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 41\nTURLOUGH: Oh, look. Troll-like warmongers. Marvellous. (GETTING UP) I think we’d better find the others.\nNYSSA: I can’t run, Turlough. Not for long.\nTURLOUGH: Then I’1l1 have to go alone.\nNYSSA: What, and leave me here?\nTURLOUGH: You’re not helpless, Nyssa. (RUNNING OFF) I have to go.\nNYSSA: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Turlough! Turlough!!!\nTURLOUGH: (OFF, RUNNING) I’m thinking about your safety. Only your safety!!! (EXITS AT FAR END OF COURTYARD)\nCLUN: (STOMPING UP) There, soldier! Running!\nVEND: I see him, Corporal!

I confess, I’m curious to know more about those orders you mentioned...\nTHURR: Sontaran battle-orders may not be discussed with enemy combatants!\nTEGAN: We’re hardly that. We’re not even armed!\nMEZZ: You might have weapons concealed about your person.\nTEGAN: If you thought that, you’d have searched us. But you’ve not done anything practical, have you? Seems to me all you’ve done Since we met, Napoleon, is strut around with that swagger stick of yours, shouting. Well, colour me unimpressed!\nTHURR: What is this ‘Napoleon’? Is it an insult?\nDOCTOR: (SOOTHINGLY) A famous military leader from the history of planet Earth. Noted for his strategic genius.\nTEGAN: That, and for being five foot nothing.\nMEZZ: He had... five feet?\nTHURR: Oh, but the female mocks us, Sergeant! I can sense it!\nMEZZ: Do you think so, sir?\nTHURR: Obviously, she has not considered Standing Order Four-Four- Seven, Subsidiary Clause Two.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 43\nTEGAN: Sorry, Shorty — didn’t catch that. Went straight under my head.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, please —\nMEZZ: Subsidiary Clause Two: ‘Mockery of a Sontaran officer is to be considered an act of war.’\nTEGAN: You what?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I rather think there’s been a breakdown in communication here. My friend Ms Jovanka was not, in fact, declaring a one- woman war against the whole of the Sontaran Empire —\nTHURR: Then what did she mean by ‘Shorty’?\nTEGAN: Well, on my planet, short warriors are the most prized. You know, for their physical prowess, and general aggression.\nTHURR: Is this true?\nTEGAN: Bite my ankles if I tell a lie.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — as you’ve heard, Ms Jovanka has nothing but the utmost respect for your, er, kind. (CHANGING SUBJECT) These orders of yours, Field-Majov...\nTHURR: (TETCHY) What about them?\nDOCTOR: The thing is, I didn’t decide to come here to Samur until little more than an hour ago. So I’m curious to know how your Fleet-Marshal Stabb could possibly have known to find me here, given that you must have departed Sontar — when? Three days ago, given the distance from there to here?\nTHURR: Do you seriously expect me to question the orders of a superior officer, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 44\nTEGAN: The point is, big boy — what if your mission here has nothing to do with us?\nTHURR: But it must do!\nDOCTOR: But if it doesn’t, Field-Major — well, then, you’re neglecting the orders of a superior officer. Which wouldn’t, I assume, go down well with your Fleet-Marshal Stabb — would it now?\nCLUN: (VIA COMMS) Corporal Clun hailing Sergeant Mezz! Sergeant Mezz, come in, please!\nTEGAN: Hadn’t you better get that?\nTHURR: Go ahead, Sergeant.\nMEZZ: Receiving you, Corporal Clun.

(TO THURR) What should I say, Field- Major?\nTHURR: Tell him to bring the diseased female here. We shall interrogate all three!\nDOCTOR: And the rogue male?\nTEGAN: (CALLOUS) What about him?\nTHURR: Another of your platoon, is that so? He is attempting to evade capture. (TO MEZZ) Tell the Corporal — as soon as he is Sighted, blast him to plasma!\nMEZZ: Yes, sir! [Corporal Clun, Corporal Clun. Your orders are this: bring the diseased female here. The male must be blasted to plasma. Repeat, blasted to plasma! ]\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) One question, Doctor. These Sontarans of yours: are they always this stupid?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No, actually, Tegan.

TOP OF CITADEL WALL\nTHURR: This business about Fleet-Marshal Stabb’s orders. What do you think, Sergeant?\nMEZZ: I am only a Sergeant, sir. I leave the thinking to you.\nTHURR: True, true.\nMEZZ: But perhaps you would be well-advised to recover the Fleet- Marshal’s orders from the main ship.\nTHURR: You do not believe that my orders concern this Doctor and his company, then?\nMEZZ: I believe only in the glory of Sontar, sir.\nTHURR: Ah, yes. The glory of Sontar!\nMEZZ: But I would remind you that the Fleet-Marshal does not tolerate incompetence. He once had every tenth member of an entire division boiled down to make a fabric lining for his tuniform, just for square-bashing in an unfavourable direction.\nTHURR: Right. Right.\nMEZZ: Left it was, I believe, sir.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Excuse me, Field-Major? I have a proposition.\nTHURR: You seek permission to speak?\nTEGAN: Obviously.\nTHURR: Not you. The male may speak!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 50\nTEGAN: What, I don’t have permission? Figures — there’s something kind of piggy about you, guess the male chauvinism comes as part of the deal...\nTHURR: (TO MEZZ) Sergeant — is she mocking us again?\nTEGAN: It’s not mockery, it’s satire. World of difference.\nTHURR: What is this ‘satire’? Sontarans do not recognise ‘satire’!\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Never a truer word spoken.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Tegan, if I might have permission to speak?\nTEGAN: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (TO THURR) I’ve been thinking, Field-Major. Your communicators — they’re powered by organic crystallography, is that correct?\nTHURR: That is correct.\nDOCTOR: So each contains one small organic crystal, with a limited range of just fifty kilometres or so. But if one were to bring all six of those crystals together, their range could be boosted arithmetically.\nTEGAN: This is relevant, how?\nDOCTOR: Well, because all six crystals together would have a functioning range of fifty to the power of six kilometres.\nTEGAN: That’s, what — fifteen billion kays?\nDOCTOR: Fifteen billion, six hundred and twenty-five million, in fact.\nTEGAN: Show-off.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: Sorry. (TO THURR) But the point is, well within reach of listening posts on Sontar.\nTHURR: (CLUELESS) This means... this means what, exactly?\nJORR: Permission to speak, sir!\nTHURR: Trooper Jorr. Permission granted.\nJORR: It means, sir, that you could call up Sontar to establish the precise nature of your orders!\nMEZZ: . and determine whether or not we are in fact required to execute this ‘Doctor’, yes!\nDOCTOR: Well, I suppose so. —\nTHURR: Or if we are to torture him first.\nDOCTOR: Yes. —\nMEZZ: Or torture him, dissect him, export his living brain from his cranium and transport it back to Sontar for study.\nDOCTOR: Possibly. —\nJORR: . but not before executing his remains and burying them somewhere in this dismal hole.\nDOCTOR: As I say, very possibly.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Doctor, you must have a kangaroo loose in the top paddock if you’re really gonna help these creeps!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) “A kangaroo loose in the-”?

I promise you, whoever or whatever it was assaulted your Trooper, it was not our friend Turlough.\nMEZZ: I suppose you’re about to tell us your friend would not kill?\nTEGAN: No, just that he wouldn’t take on a heavily-armed Sontaran trooper if he could find a dark corner to hide in, instead.\nDOCTOR: Turlough does have a highly-developed sense of self- preservation, that much is true.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 58\nTEGAN: Yeah, and a yellow belly.\nTHURR: (FRUSTRATED) The transmitter, Doctor!

This dismal hole grows more dismal by the minute.\nNYSSA: Thank you, Jorr.\nJORR: Work, Doctor. You must work!\nDOCTOR: Of course. (FX: JORR STOMPS OFF)\nNYSSA: How’s it going? Building your transmitter?\nDOCTOR: About as well as can be expected, given the failing light, the cold in my fingers and the fact that my only tool... is a pen- knife. — (NICKS HIMSELF) Ow!\nNYSSA: Cut yourself?\nDOCTOR: Just a scratch.\nNYSSA: Will the range be sufficient? With only four communicators?\nDOCTOR: (RESUMES TINKERING) Four should be enough for what I have in mind. But I shan’t be telling the Field-Major that. See if we can’t buy Tegan a little more time, to find that antigen...\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. PIT LEADING TO CRASH SITE\nTEGAN: (CALLING BEHIND) I think I see the ship! Just a few more levels down!\nMEZZ: (FX: TREADING OVER RUBBLE) Wait, Tegan Jovanka. The terrain is treacherous.\nTEGAN: I’m the one wearing heels, Sergeant!\nMEZZ: The ship impacted through many courtyards. The masonry is inferior. The damage is extensive.\nTEGAN: (FX: WALKS ON) Then mind your step, but get a move on — (STUMBLES OVER DEAD BODY; CRACKING SOUNDS) Aah!\nMEZZ: (CATCHING UP) I told you, proceed with caution. —\nTEGAN: Yeah, only I wasn’t expecting to tread on a corpse.\nMEZZ: Show me. (FX: ROLLS BODY OVER) It is Pilot Bekk.\nTEGAN: You sure? Looks like he’s been dismembered, then — I don’t know, freeze-dried or something. All the juice sucked out of him.\nMEZZ: He died in the crash. Death in the field is certain fora Sontaran. It does not concern us. Proceed.\nTEGAN: You’re not thinking, Sergeant. Are you telling me that when your ship crashed, this Pilot Bekk was flung fifty feet in the air, in pieces, only for all of those pieces to land together here?\nMEZZ: Proceed!\nTEGAN: He wasn’t dead. He can’t have been! He survived the crash. He climbed out of the crater. Only when he climbed out — something carved him up, then reduced him to an empty husk.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 70\nMEZZ: The fugitive male. Your friend. He was responsible.\nTEGAN: Turlough? He’d pass out if he pricked his finger on a nail. It was a sword did this! (BEAT) You’re thinking what I’m thinking, Mezz. I know you are.\nMEZZ: Corporal Clun is deranged by age. There are no Witch Guards! No ghosts with swords!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE\nVEND: I shall go first. To the right.\nTURLOUGH: Actually, I think I’1ll go first. If it’s all the same to you, Trooper Vend.\nVEND: Do you see it, Prisoner Turlough? In the darkness?\nTURLOUGH: No. It’s too dark down there to see anything.\nVEND: But does it not seem to you like the darkness itself is alive?\nTURLOUGH: You’re seeing things. Fear will do that.\nVEND: I am not afraid!\nWITCH GUARD: (DISTANT, APPROACHING) The blood of the Seven must be paid...\nVEND: There, see — the darkness, it is moving! It is alive!\nWITCH GUARD: (NEARER) Seven sacrifices must be made...\nTURLOUGH: I seem to be sharing your delusion.\nWITCH GUARD: (NEARER) Before the curse is lifted.\nTURLOUGH: Whatever it is.. it’s real.

By this Witch Guard business?\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) .. No. No, I don’t suppose you are.\nNYSSA: I think the Field-Major must be a very average Sontaran. If he can’t shout at it, or blow it up, he denies its existence.\nDOCTOR: True. But if Corporal Clun is to be believed, these Witch Guards were real enough once.\nCLUN: (FROM BEHIND THEM) The Guards were real. Their curse was, too.\nDOCTOR: Corporal Clun. (THAT’S ODD) You startled me.\nCLUN: I apologise.\nDOCTOR: No, I mean — sneaking up like that. Sontarans aren’t noted for their stealth.\nCLUN: You don’t last thirty-five years in the Sontaran service without learning a trick or two. Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No. No, I don’t suppose you do.\nCLUN: We know you, Doctor. You are many. The stories about you are legion.\nDOCTOR: I get around.\nNYSSA: ‘Curse’.

But ever since the conquest of Samur, the Empire has concentrated its resources... further back in the Madeleine Cluster.\nDOCTOR: They’ve retreated. Or ‘consolidated their forces’, I should say.\nNYSSA: Spoken like a true Sontaran.\nCLUN: Consolidation has followed consolidation. Withdrawal has followed withdrawal.\nNYSSA: Defeat, after defeat, after defeat.\nCLUN: But I was there, twenty years ago. When my Commander ordered one hundred canisters of Agent Zed oblique stroke zero zero two exploded in the troposphere, and planet Samur bloomed purple, and the Witch Guard he’d captured —\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) You mean, the one you caught in a tractor beam?\nCLUN: .

Remember him?\nTURLOUGH: Yes. —\nTEGAN: We need a sample from that bath. For Nyssa.

No. But I’1l be able to help.\nNYSSA: I’m twice the biochemist you are. You know that. Doctor, there’s something I have to tell you...\nDOCTOR: Save your energy, Nyssa. (STANDING) You’re right. Time to activate the back-up plan.\nNYSSA: The transmitter? What good will that do? It doesn’t have the necessary range.\nDOCTOR: To contact Sontar, no. But we only need to reach as far the stratosphere.\nNYSSA: To do what? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: A Rutan patrol shot the Sontaran ship down, remember? I think we should tell them there were survivors.\nNYSSA: You’re going to bring the Rutans here?\nDOCTOR: There’s a chance we could escape in the confusion.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 86\nNYSSA: There’s a greater chance we could be killed in the crossfire!\nDOCTOR: Nevertheless, it’s the only plan I’ve got.

It’s stopped!\nTURLOUGH: What has?\nTEGAN: The Witch Guard, or whatever it calls itself. Vend — is there a\nTEGAN: scanner in here? Can we see the outside?\nVEND: (STILL REELING) On the control board. Yellow dial.\nTEGAN: There, see?\nTURLOUGH: It’s gone back into the darkness.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 90\nTEGAN: So — either we make a dash for it, and hope the Flashing Blade there doesn’t reform and catch us —\nTURLOUGH: Or?\nTEGAN: Or, we take the short cut.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44: EXT.

No: you’re killing them!\nDOCTOR: You’re quite right.\nDOCTOR: THURR & JORR:\nNYSSA: That was more than just feedback.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The signal must have bounced off something in the stratosphere.\nNYSSA: The Rutan patrol, obviously.\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. Whatever it is up there, it’s keyed to the Sontaran consciousness. The feedback reverberated right into the Sontaran mid-brain. Through their probic vents at the back of their heads, most likely.\nTHURR: (RECOVERING) You... you did this deliberately...\nDOCTOR: The effect was quite unintentional, Field-Major, of that I assure you. But it if there is something other than a Rutan patrol in orbit...\nNYSSA: They might help us!\nTHURR: Trooper Jorr — destroy the Doctor!!!\nJORR: With pleasure, Field-Major, sir!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 92\nNYSSA: I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Trooper. Not when the Doctor can plunge you into mental agony at the flick of a switch.\nDOCTOR: Of course, yes!\nTHURR: Lower your blaster, Trooper Jorr!\nNYSSA: A wise decision, Field-Major. So: it seems we have the upper hand.\nTHURR: The vexatiousness of these females! Doctor, how do you bear it?\nDOCTOR: Usually, I just do as I’m told. Less painful, all round.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: INT. CRASHED SHIP\nTEGAN: Trooper. Trooper Vend! Snap out of it! .. This ship must have forward-facing armaments, right?\nVEND: A bank of plasma cannons. Yes.\nTURLOUGH: What use are they? We’re buried upside-down, remember? ... (REALISATION) Oh no. You can’t be serious.\nTEGAN: We use them like retros. Take the short cut, and blast this ship right out of the crater! We’ll be back with the Doctor and Nyssa in no time!\nTURLOUGH: Alternatively, we blow ourselves to kingdom come. Along with half the Citadel, most likely.\nTEGAN: Come on, Turlough. Show some backbone.\nTURLOUGH: It’s showing my backbone I’m afraid of! And every other part of my insides!\nVEND: Look!

This is a short-range vessel. You’1ll be lucky to launch it into the stratosphere, but you’1ll never have the fuel to land it again.\nDOCTOR: Ah. The thing is, I’m not planning to land it.\nNYSSA: (WARNING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: There’s something up there, Nyssa, in the stratosphere. Something big, and technologically complex. Now — either we dither here and hope against hope that help arrives before you die, or I launch myself into the stratosphere and find that help.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 95\nNYSSA: But what if you’re wrong? What if there’s nothing there? Or whatever it is simply — well, blasts you to plasma?\nDOCTOR: Then at least I’ll have tried.\nTHURR: Oh, but this is heroic stuff!\nNYSSA: It’s a suicide mission!\nTHURR: Like I said, heroic.\nDOCTOR: Yes, when a Sontaran calls you heroic, chances are you’re doing the wrong thing. But nevertheless — (STEPPING INTO GRAVITY SPHERE )\nNYSSA: Doctor, I don’t want to die alone!\nDOCTOR: (FROM INSIDE SPHERE) I won’t let that happen. Now — I suggest you all clear the area. There’ll be a bit of a backblast.\nNYSSA: Please, Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: You have the transmitter, Nyssa. If the Sontarans misbehave — well, you know what to do.

The moss has spread.\nTURLOUGH: That’s horrible!\nTEGAN: Yes, thank you, Turlough. (REMEMBERING) The canister. I must have dropped that canister! (SEARCHES FOR DROPPED CANISTER OFF)\nNYSSA: You found it, then? The antigen?\nTEGAN: (OFF) Got it!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 102\nTURLOUGH: (TO NYSSA) We did. Where’s the Doctor?\nNYSSA: Somewhere in the sky, I suppose.\nNYSSA: TURLOUGH & TEGAN: (TOGETHER) He’s dead?!?\nTHURR: (STOMPING IN) Almost certainly. (ASIDE) Jorr, remain on watch!\nNYSSA: We don’t know the Doctor’s dead, Field-Major. (TO TEGAN & TURLOUGH) He took a gravity sphere, to look for help.\nTEGAN: Well, never fear. (HOLDING OUT CANISTER) Your antigen’s here. —\nNYSSA: Oh, thank you! Thank you! —\nTHURR: Ah, my orders!!! (SNATCHES CANISTER)\nTEGAN: Hey, give that back!\nTHURR: (FX: UNSCREWING LID) But — the seal is broken. Who broke the seal on my orders?\nTEGAN: It was me. Look, there was nothing inside the canister. I needed something to hold the sample, that’s all —\nTHURR: But — it is full of nutrient!!!\nTEGAN: I told you, there was nothing inside —\nTHURR: Impossible!\nTHURR: (HURLS CANISTER ASIDE) Bah!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 103\nNYSSA: (WAILS) No!!!\nTURLOUGH: (RUSHING OFF, TO CANISTER) It’s alright, it won’t have all spilled out. (STOPS. BEAT) .. Oh. Actually, it has.\nTEGAN: There’s more of it in the infrastructure. Turlough took a shower in it, you see —\nTURLOUGH: (RETURNING) Not on purpose!\nNYSSA: In the infrastructure, you say?\nTEGAN: Gallons of the stuff.\nNYSSA: Then it’1ll be contaminated. Useless. (BEAT) Was it very viscous?\nTEGAN: Yeah, like baby oil. Only more, you know, rubbery.\nNYSSA: Then that explains how this ship survived a second crash. The nutrient acted as a shock absorber.\nTEGAN: Oh, [right!]\nTHURR: Quiet!!! Tegan Jovanka, you have vexed me for the final time!\nTHURR: Trooper Vend — take this troublesome female outside!\nVEND: (STEPPING FORWARD) Yes, sir, Field-Major, sir!\nTEGAN: (GRABBED BY VEND) Get off me, pipsqueak!\nNYSSA: What are you going to do to her? Field-Major?\nTHURR: You will see. Outside. March!!! Left-right, left-right, left- right... [ETC] (FX: ALL TROMP OUT)\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: INT. GRAVITY SPHERE\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) There. I seem to have overshot the target somewhat. Might as well try the comms. — (FX: FLICKING SWITCH) (INTO COMMS) Hello. Can anyone hear me? .. I’m in a Sontaran gravity\nDOCTOR: sphere, in the stratosphere above Samur. A little way above the stratosphere, in fact. Floating in a most peculiar way.\nDOCTOR: That’s an internal pressure warning, I think. Worrying. Anyway. I repeat: I’m in a Sontaran gravity sphere, but I am not, repeat not, a Sontaran. I have news for anyone interested in the Sontaran mission to Samur, but I wish to stress that I’m acting in a strictly neutral capacity. Under the terms of the Fifteenth Treaty, I, and all of my associates, should be considered non-combatants, and as such exempt from martial jurisduction. (BEAT) That’s ‘martial’ spelled m-a-r-t-i-a-l, not the other kind. —\nDOCTOR: Ow!!! I seem to have an electrical short of some [kind]. — Ah. A Rutan scout to starboard. Awkward. —\nDOCTOR: . and yes, there’s another to port. I really should have listened to Nyssa...\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nTHURR: (EXTREMELY BELLIGERENT) Left-right, left-right, left-right... Halt! Humanoids will line up against the wall.\nTURLOUGH: You can’t make us. —\nTHURR: (BELLOWING) Humanoids will make a line!!! Trooper Jorr, Trooper Vend — form a party!\nTEGAN: Ooh. Party.\nTHURR: (INSANE WITH RAGE) A shooting party! A firing squad!!!\nTEGAN: What for? Regulations, remember?\nTHURR: For the interception and destruction of a secret Sontaran communiqué. Sealed orders, from Fleet Marshal Stabb!\nTEGAN: I told you, there was nothing inside that canister!\nTHURR: Then you admit breaking the seal?\nTURLOUGH: I was there. Honestly, there was nothing inside!\nTHURR: Breaking the seal alone qualifies as espionage. And spies may be punished by summary execution! Squad: present — arms!!!\nVEND: Remain still, Prisoner Turlough. It will be quicker.\nTURLOUGH: Not with your hands shaking like that, it won’t.\nNYSSA: Field-Major, you’re forgetting one thing —\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 106\nTHURR: I am aware that you did not break the seal, Nyssa of Traken. You are to be destroyed as an act of mercy! Galactic convention on distressed combatants — look it up!\nNYSSA: You’re forgetting the transmitter! All I have to do is activate the transmitter, and you and your men will be rendered — [helpless] (BREAKS OFF) Well, where is it?\nJORR: (BRANDISHING TRANSMITTER) You are looking for this, Nyssa of Traken?\nJORR: NYSSA3: The transmitter! How?\nJORR: You dropped it. On the Wall of No Division, when the ship came over.\nTEGAN: Well, that’s helpful.\nNYSSA: Sorry. —\nTHURR: Silence!!! Squad, on my command. Ready. Ain...\nMEZZ: (FROM OFF) Do you think that is wise, sir?\nTEGAN: Mezz?!? But he’s —\nTHURR: Sergeant Mezz, where on Sontar have you been?\nMEZZ: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) The female human is telling the truth, Field-Major Thurr. The canister was empty.\nTHURR: Well, how do you know that?\nTEGAN: I’m wondering much the same!\nMEZZ: The canister was empty because you had no orders, Field-Major.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 107\nTHURR: Sealed orders, Sergeant! Given to me by the Fleet-Marshal himself. You were there, with me, on Sontar!\nCLUN: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) You had no orders, Field-Major, because all the Fleet Marshal needed you and your men to do, was die.\nTHURR: Corporal Clun, why aren’t you on patrol?\nMEZZ: The Corporal was on patrol when the Witch Guards took him, over an hour ago.\nCLUN: (FX: SWISHING SWORD) Cut him into pieces, and absorbed his essence.\nTHURR: What are you talking about? And where did you get that sword?\nTEGAN: Don’t you get it? He’s dead. Like Sergeant Mezz is dead!\nTHURR: Mezz is here! He isn’t dead!\nVEND: He is, sir. I saw it. The Witch Guard killed him!\nTHURR: Silence, Trooper Vend!\nVEND: Forgot to ask: permission to speak?\nMEZZ: Mezz is dead. Clun is dead. Nold and Bekk here —\nMEZZ: . all dead.\nTHURR: Nold? Bekk?\nNYSSA: It’s the curse, isn’t it? We should have paid more attention to the curse.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 108\nTHURR: What curse?\nNYSSA: (QUOTING) “The blood of the Seven must be paid. Seven sacrifices must be made. Before the curse is lifted.” Don’t you see?\nMEZZ: Seven of your finest sons...\nCLUN: Brought to us for slaughter.\nMEZZ: Only then will the blood-debt owed...\nCLUN: Be cancelled forever after.\nTEGAN: They’re changing shape! Reforming!\nTURLOUGH: Don’t you get it — they’re the Witch Guards!\nTHURR: Changing shape? How?\nWITCH GUARD: We absorbed Rutan scouts, when they landed here.\nWITCH GUARD: This is why they guard Samur. To prevent our leaving.\nWITCH GUARD: We absorbed their strength. Their powers.\nWITCH GUARD: Now, we shall absorb yours.\nWITCH GUARD: 4 x WITCH GUARDS: Now. Now. Now!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70: INT. GRAVITY SPHERE\nDOCTOR: (INTO COMMS) Gravity sphere calling Rutan scouts. As I said, I’m not a Sontaran, I’m a Time Lord called ‘the Doctor’. I think I may be known to you. —\nDOCTOR: Oof! .. I realise we’ve not seen eye to eye in the past. Eye to visual sensory apparatus, rather. But I promise you my intentions are non-hostile, so I’d sooner you stopped firing your thunderbolts at me. —\nDOCTOR: Damage now critical. That’s not good. Rutan scouts — I repeat, my intentions are [non-hostile! ]\nDOCTOR: (FX: DROWNED OUT BY TWO SHORT BUT LOUD EXPLOSIONS IN QUICK SUCCESSION.

Now — firstly, let me just say I’m terribly grateful that you rescued me from the Rutans. For a moment there, it looked rather like my number was well and truly up.\nSTABB: You have been rescued from nothing, Doctor. Your death is no less certain than it was. But it will be more... protracted. (TO SONTARAN CREW AROUND) Eh, my troopers?\nSTABB: 20 x SONTARANS:\nDOCTOR: Your species is still sore about that Gallifrey business, then. Only to be expected, I suppose. Never mind. Very well — (LOUDLY, PROCLAIMING) I offer you my complete capitulation.\nSTABB: Eh? Speak up, damn you!\nDOCTOR: (LOUDER) Furthermore, I offer you my willing participation in any propaganda materials you may wish to create: ‘I, the legendary Doctor, hail the mighty Sontaran Empire, that has finally conquered me’ — that sort of thing.\nSTABB: Is this a Time Lord trick?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR: All I ask is: first, that you rescue my friends from the surface of Samur; second, that you make every reasonable effort to reverse the damage done to them by Sontaran bacteriological weapons...\nSTABB: It is a Time Lord trick!\nDOCTOR: . and third, that you despatch them to a neutral planet at an appropriately advanced level of development.\nSTABB: That is all?\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe it’s asking so very much, in the circumstances.\nSTABB: This offer cannot be accepted!\nDOCTOR: Disappointing. It was my only card, rather. Is there any particular reason why not?\nSTABB: Because first: if we are to make a propaganda film of you begging for mercy, we shall obtain it by submitting you to every one of the processes outlined in Field-Major Styre’s manual on humanoid resistance to torture!\nDOCTOR: Styre? I didn’t realise he’d published.\nSTABB: Posthumously. (BEAT) Second: the moment that the Witch Guards destroy the three remaining members of the Sontaran mission to Samur, the three thousand cobalt-headed missiles carried by this battlesphere will blast the wretched planet below to less than dust!\nDOCTOR: Will it now?\nSTABB: Making a rescue mission... impractical.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can see that.

COURTYARD EAST\nNYSSA: Tegan’s right, though. If these are not the finest sons of Sontar, how can their sacrifice lift the curse?\nWITCH GUARD: There are seven great clans within the Empire.\nTHURR: Clone descendants of Sontar’s most decorated soldiers, yes.\nWITCH GUARD: These seven are genetically identical to seven of Sontar’s finest sons... but each is the runt of their litter!\nTURLOUGH: So their ‘sacrifice’ is purely symbolic?\nNYSSA: I don’t think so. If the Witch Guards absorb a direct copy of each of the Sontarans’ greatest heroes...\nTEGAN: . they can re-create those heroes, is that it?\nNYSSA: Perhaps. But why?\nWITCH GUARD: You will never know. Comrades — destroy and absorb the humanoids!\nTURLOUGH: I thought you didn’t need us!\nWITCH GUARD: We have the memories of Sontar’s greatest heroes. We know their legends, about their battles with the Doctor...\nWITCH GUARD: About his travels in time and space. About his TARDIS. Absorb you, and we will gain insight into its operation.\nWITCH GUARD: We shall be free of this world! We shall be free of this time!\nTURLOUGH: Only Nyssa knows how to fly the TARDIS. And the Doctor, of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 117\nTEGAN: Turlough, you weasel!\nNYSSA: It’s alright, I’ll be dead soon anyway. They might as well absorb me, if it means you two get to live.\nTEGAN: No chance. No-one else is dying today. Not on my watch.\nWITCH GUARD: You speak like a warrior, Tegan Jovanka. You, too, will be absorbed...\nTEGAN: What?! ?\nWITCH GUARD: . but the boy Turlough is too treacherous to be of value.\nTURLOUGH: If you say so.\nWITCH GUARD: Then kill him. But do not absorb him.\nTURLOUGH: What?!?\nTEGAN: Serves you right, ratfink.\nWITCH GUARD: Advance and destroy them! Now! Now! Now!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75: INT.

(PASSES CLUB)\nDOCTOR: I’d really rather [not] — (TAKING CLUB, SAGGING UNDER WEIGHT) This is ridiculous, this thing weighs a ton!\nSTABB: The club currently has a relative weight of ten pounds. But throughout the course of our duel, the weight will increase automatically...\nDOCTOR: (STAGGERING AS CLUB’S WEIGHT INCREASES) Ooof!\nSTABB: . until one of us can no longer lift his club to defend\nSTABB: himself.\nDOCTOR: Or one of us has been pulverised by the other.\nSTABB: I shall take the first swing.

Take it back, Adjutant.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 119\nSTABB: Then you forfeit your turn, Doctor. My swing. (EFFORT) Huurgh!\nDOCTOR: Missed again.\nSTABB: (TIRED, TO SONTARANS) Cheer! Cheer, my warriors! Or I shall have you all boiled into glue!\nSTABB: 20 x SONTARANS:\nDOCTOR: While you catch your breath — I’m still wondering about this curse of yours, Fleet Marshal.\nSTABB: It was how the Witch Guard told me, when I captured the creature all those years ago.\nDOCTOR: You captured it?\nSTABB: I was a young Commander then. The conquest of Samur made me a hero. Promoted. Feted. Cloned a million times over.\nDOCTOR: Only things haven’t gone so well since. For the Empire, I mean.\nSTABB: No. — (EFFORT) Huuurgh!\nSTABB: 20 x SONTARANS:\nDOCTOR: That’s, what, forty pounds now?\nSTABB: (BREATHLESS) My club will split your skull in two, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Slow down, you’ll do yourself a damage. One last question. What happened to the Witch Guard you captured?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 120\nSTABB: I took a plasma cannon to it. It evaporated into darkness, like smoke. Then it dispersed altogether.\nDOCTOR: Darkness?\nSTABB: Eardrum trouble. I empathise.\nDOCTOR: No, no. But all this is very, very interesting. I have a theory, if you’d care to hear it?\nSTABB: No. — (EFFORT) Huuurgh!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: EXT. COURTYARD EAST\nWITCH GUARDS: (ADVANCING) Kill them. Absorb them. Now!!!\nTURLOUGH: Retreat, Field-Major! We have to retreat!\nTHURR: Retreat, pah! It is not the Sontaran way!\nVEND: They’re getting closer!\nJORR: Push the hostages onto their blades! With any luck, they’1ll get stuck! Stop these Witch Guards in their tracks!\nJORR: NYSSA3: Nooo!!!\nVEND: They’1l never stop! They’1l just keep coming!\nTEGAN: No, wait! They did stop, once before. Back at the crater. —\nNYSSA: Well, what made them do that? Think, Tegan!\nTEGAN: Feedback! From the transmitter! Field-Major, activate the transmitter!\nTHURR: But that will only cause us Sontarans mental agony!\nNYSSA: It’ll do the same to the Witch Guards! Don’t you see? They haven’t only absorbed your comrades’ strengths — they’ve absorbed their weaknesses, too!\nWITCH GUARD: It is... not true!\nTEGAN: True enough to cause you to pause! (TO THURR) Do it, Napoleon!\nVEND: She is right, sir! Switch on!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 122\nTHURR: . Bahhh! (FX: SWITCHES ON. FUZZ/FEEDBACK FILLS THE AIR)\nTHURR: SONTARANS & WITCH GUARDS:\nNYSSA: Tegan, you were right!\nTEGAN: Don’t sound too surprised, will you?!? Let’s get the Sontarans into the ship, back under cover. —\nTURLOUGH: Again, why are we saving them?\nTEGAN: Because Napoleon was right. We are all in this together!\nWITCH GUARD: (GASPING THROUGH PAIN) The batteries in your transmitter, they cannot last!\nWITCH GUARD: (DITTO) You only delay the inevitable, Tegan Jovanka!\nTEGAN: Yeah, well — as my Auntie Vanessa used to say:\nTURLOUGH: Here we go. “Where there’s life, there’s hope”, I suppose?\nTEGAN: Hardly. (TO WITCH GUARDS) “Get stuffed!”\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77: INT. BRIDGE OF SONTARAN BATTLESPHERE\nSTABB: (BECOMING EXHAUSTED) Stop... prancing about, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: As I was saying — my theory. Suppose the decline of the Sontaran Empire didn’t in fact coincide with the placing of the Witch Guard’s curse... but the moment that you, Fleet Marshal, became a hero. Cloned a million times over, you said?\nSTABB: There’s barely a platoon in the Fleet that doesn’t contain a broodling descended from me!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. It’s your clones, I think, that have caused those defeats. Almost as if someone, or something, had corrupted their inheritance. Made them marginally more clumsy, perhaps? A little slow, or lacking in initiative?\nSTABB: (EFFORT) Huuurgh!\nSTABB: 20 x SONTARANS:\nDOCTOR: You’11l be through to the below deck if you keep on like that. (BEAT) You see, I don’t think that Witch Guard died. I think it dissipated into you.. and after corrupting your DNA, it was able to corrupt the whole of the Sontaran military machine accordingly.\nSTABB: Ridiculous!\nDOCTOR: You realised that a while ago, of course. In your position as Fleet Marshal, only you would have been able to see the pattern develop. And if any strategists dared to notice, too — well, you could always have them melted down.\nADJUTANT: Fleet-Marshal, is this true?\nSTABB: Lies! All of it!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: Out of desperation, you decided at last to fulfil the terms of the curse. But it won’t work, Fleet Marshal.\nSTABB: Lies! All lies!\nDOCTOR: Whatever these Witch Guards are, they’re not magical. They wanted you to send them seven of Sontar’s finest sons, for some reason. Has it not occurred to you to wonder why?\nSTABB: Now, Doctor. Now — I shall flatten you!!!\nDOCTOR: One hundred and sixty pounds. That’s too much, even for a Sontaran. —\nADJUTANT: Fleet Marshal? Sir?\nDOCTOR: I can’t claim to be the greatest authority on Sontaran physiognomy, but it looks rather like a seizure to me.\nADJUTANT: The Fleet Marshal — is dead?\nDOCTOR: Still Unvanquished, I think. Do you have a medical kit, by any chance?\nADJUTANT: (CALLING OFF) Boosters! Revitalisers! NOW!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 125\nSTABB: (WEAK, WHEEZY) You, Doctor. You did this... to me! I shall forma phalanx of engineers, tasked solely with devising new and exotic ways to torture you!\nDOCTOR: Later, Fleet Marshal. Ah, medical kit, thank you, Adjutant. —\nADJUTANT: That — that is the air attack warning!\nADJUTANT: (FX: ‘THUNDERCRACK’ AGAINST HULL OF BATTLESPHERE. ELECTRICAL JUDDERS, AS IN SCENE 6 ETC. CONTINUE SPORADICALLY THROUGH: )\nSTABB: A-air attack?\nDOCTOR: You destroyed two Rutan scouts, it’s no surprise to find an entire squadron not far behind. I was beginning to think they’d never arrive.\nADJUTANT: (CALLING) Battle stations, troopers! Rutan scum, incoming!\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING THROUGH KIT) Now, what’s in this kit? .. Ah, now this is interesting. I think I’1l take it, if you don’t mind.\nSTABB: Doctor! You must save me!\nDOCTOR: Here, Fleet Marshal — revitaliser leads. Plug yourself in — give yourself a jump start, put the grey back in your cheeks.\nSTABB: But — you cannot leave! (CALLING WEAKLY) Stop him, my warriors!\nDOCTOR: Everyone seems rather too busy at present. Farewell, Fleet Marshal, it’s been... enlightening. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78: INT. CRASHED SHIP\nTHURR: (COMING TO HIS SENSES) W-where am I? Ohh — that noise, it is still in my head!\nNYSSA: Back in the ship, Field-Major. I’ve reduced the transmitter’s power, so the batteries might last a little longer.\nTURLOUGH: Yes, but how much longer?\nNYSSA: An hour or so more, perhaps. It’s hard to tell.\nTURLOUGH: A little more time to think about what it’1ll feel like to be slaughtered. That’s useful.\nTEGAN: A little more time for the Doctor to get here, Turlough.\nTHURR: Your ‘Doctor’. Your hero of Gallifrey. Accept it — your Doctor is dead!\nJORR: And we are all going to die in this dismal hole!\nNYSSA: Tegan, might I have a word? In private?\nTEGAN: Sure. Anything to get away from these little rays of sunshine.\nVEND: Permission to ask a question, Field-Major?\nTHURR: Is it important, Trooper Vend?\nVEND: I have been wondering. Why do we Sontarans fight?\nTHURR: Why? For the glory of Sontar, that is why.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 127\nVEND: Is not Sontar glorious enough already, without a billion Sontaran soldiers dying in its name each year?\nJORR: Give the Trooper an acid pill, Field-Major. His mind has gone.\nTHURR: I agree. (PRODUCING PILL FROM BELT) Coronic acid, trooper. Place it on the tip of your tongue, so it might melt you down from the inside.\nVEND: But —\nJORR: Death before dishonour, Trooper! Death before dishonour!\nTHURR: Like Jorr says. ..

They had it inscribed over the roll of honour at Brendon, for old boys who'd been in the wars. It means: “How sweet and fitting it is/to die for one’s country.”\nTHURR: A fine sentiment!\nTURLOUGH: There was more. Something about ‘Death sparing not the cowardly backs/Of battle-shy youths...’?

In our old bedroom, in the TARDIS, there’s a small grey data recorder. If I die — listen! If I die, I need you to get the Doctor to take you back to Terminus. But you mustn’t tell him why.\nTEGAN: Okay...\nNYSSA: It’s complicated. He won’t find out, you see, until the future. He'll be in a farmhouse, in a blizzard, and... well, that’s not important now.\nTEGAN: Finds out what? Nyssa?\nNYSSA: On Terminus, they can put you in touch with a Professor Lasarti. You have to give him the data recorder. It contains everything I’ve learned about Richter’s Syndrome.\nTEGAN: The virus?\nNYSSA: Tell Lasarti, the password is ‘Tremas’.\nTEGAN: ‘Tremas’. Got you.\nNYSSA: And tell him... Tell him there was so much more I wanted to tell him.\nTEGAN: (HALF-JOKING) This Lasarti. He’s not —\nNYSSA: My husband. Yes.\nTEGAN: Your husband?!?\nNYSSA: I couldn’t tell you before, because of the Doctor.

You’1ll be telling me you've got kids next!\nNYSSA: A boy. Well, a teenager. His name is Adric.\nTEGAN: Not another one!\nNYSSA: He has an older sister. Always arguing, always telling me why I’m wrong about everything, and how she knows so much better. Her name... her name is.. (DOESN’T SAY ‘TEGAN’.

The aftermath of an explosion. A vapourisation, in\nNYSSA: fact.\nTEGAN: Yes, but of what?\nNYSSA: The Doctor detected a great mass in the sky. A vessel of some\nNYSSA: kind, perhaps.\nTHURR: A Sontaran battlesphere.\nTURLOUGH: How can you tell?\nTHURR: The implosive pattern is highly distinctive. I have seen it a\nTHURR: thousand times before.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, please don’t tell me the Doctor was aboard!\nNYSSA: I don’t know. —\nNYSSA: 4 x WITCH GUARDS (were MEZZ, CLUN, NOLD & BEKK):\nTURLOUGH: Oh no. Look who’s back!\nTEGAN: The Witch Guards. What happened to the transmitter?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 132\nNYSSA: It’s still functioning, I’m sure. But the source of the psychic feedback... isn’t.\nTURLOUGH: This ‘battlesphere’, I take it?\nWITCH GUARD: (APPROACHING) Fleet Marshal Stabb has been vanquished at last. We believe Sergeant Mezz would have been... pleased.\nWITCH GUARD: Now, you can no longer hurt us. Now.\nTHURR: Is it time, then?\nWITCH GUARD: It is time, Field Major.\nTHURR: Then we embrace it. (CALLING) Troopers Jorr and Vend, fall in!\nTEGAN: What’s Thurr playing at?\nTEGAN: JORR/VEND: (STOMPING TO HALT BESIDE THURR) Field-Major./Sir!\nTHURR: It is our time. So — we march!\nJORR: Into oblivion!\nTHURR: Into glorious oblivion!\nWITCH GUARD: Extrude your blades, witch-kin! Let your swords drink their plasma!\nTHURR: Heads up, troopers! Heads up, and march! (FX: MARCHES, JOINED BY JORR & VEND) (SINGS) [Sontar! Sontar! We march for Sontar!/...\nTHURR: THURR, JORR & VEND [VEND FALTERING]: The might of Sontar is why we march!\nTURLOUGH: This is insane. (RUSHING FORWARD, GRABBING VEND) Vend, don’t!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 133\nVEND: (STRUGGLING FREE) Leave me, Turlough! Death spares not the cowardly backs of battle-shy youths. You told me that!\nTURLOUGH: You don’t believe that any more than I do!\nTEGAN: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Turlough, get back to the ship!\nTURLOUGH: No! I have to tell him! I have to make him understand!\nTHURR: Keep up behind there, trooper!\nWITCH GUARD: Field-Major. At last.\nJORR: We die now, sir?\nTHURR: We die — for Sontar! All our lives, we have waited for this, and now the time has [come! ]\nTHURR: (FX: CUT SHORT BY FURIOUS SLASHING OF WITCH GUARD BLADES. SUCKING EFFECT, AS THURR AND JORR ARE DRAINED OF LIFE)\nVEND: They are dead. The Field-Major. Trooper Jorr. Both dead!\nTURLOUGH: Yes, and none too prettily. So if you don’t want to be next —\nNYSSA: (FROM OFF) Turlough! Behind you!\nWITCH GUARD: The coward. It is your time now.\nTURLOUGH: Vend, if you want your pathetic life to have had any meaning at all — please, get back to the ship, protect Nyssa and Tegan. (BEAT) That is an order!\nVEND: An order?\nTURLOUGH: From a Junior Ensign Commander. I outrank you, believe it or not. Now get to it!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 134\nVEND: Yes, sir! (RUSHES OFF)\nVEND: (FX: OFF, FROM THE SKY, A SONTARAN GRAVITY SPHERE IS CRUISING\nFAST TOWARDS THE GROUND THROUGH: )\nWITCH GUARD: (APPROACHING) Let us through. Let us see the coward.\nWITCH GUARD: A deserter, it seems!\nWITCH GUARD: We know what to do with hin...\nTURLOUGH: (SEEING GRAVITY SPHERE) I don’t believe it. —\nWITCH GUARD: Believe what, deserter?\nTURLOUGH: Above you? I suggest you move, if you don’t want to be squashed flat by the gravity sphere incoming.\nWITCH GUARD: He speaks the truth!\nWITCH GUARD: It cannot harm us. We are the Witch Guards. We are undying! [Immortal! ]\nWITCH GUARD: (FX: WHUMP! THE GRAVITY SPHERE CRASHES DOWN ON TOP OF THE GUARDS. SQUISH AS THEY’RE FLATTENED. BEAT. DOOR RELEASE)\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING OUT) Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. What a surprise. Mind your feet, you’re treading in Witch Guards.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Remarkable entities, I think. But I don’t suppose landing my ship on top of them will prevent their recombining. Where’s Nyssa?\nTURLOUGH: The other ship, behind you.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: Good. (SETTING OFF) No time to lose. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80: EXT/INT. CRASHED SHIP\nTURLOUGH: (OUTSIDE, RUSHING UP) .. What do you mean, ‘recombining’?\nDOCTOR: (DITTO) The Witch Guards are one creature, divided into seven parts. It needs a host for each of the seven, so it can reunite itself. Hence its need for seven sons of Sontar. Hence the curse, to draw the Sontarans back to a world they thought destroyed. (STOPPING AT DOOR) Do keep up, Turlough.\nVEND: The females are inside, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. Thank you, Trooper.\nTEGAN: Doctor! Hurry! I don’t like the look of Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: Good to see you again, by the way.\nTEGAN: I won’t ask where you’ve been. We don’t have the time.\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t suppose we do. (BENDING DOWN) Nyssa. How are you feeling?\nNYSSA: Doctor. I thought it would be painful, but now... now all I want to do is sleep.\nTURLOUGH: (TO DOCTOR) We didn’t get the antigen, I’m afraid.\nTEGAN: Well, we did, but then we lost it again.\nDOCTOR: Never mind. I found a certain something, in a Sontaran medical kit. (PATTING POCKETS) Now, which pocket did I put it in?\nTEGAN: The antigen? You got the antigen?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR: . Ah, here it is.\nTEGAN: What is that? Some sort of gizmo?\nDOCTOR: They use it to treat gangrene, I think.\nNYSSA: Oh, Doctor, you’re brilliant!\nDOCTOR: Well, I try.\nTURLOUGH: Let me guess. A biotronic agitator?\nDOCTOR: Yes, actually. How on Earth did you know that?\nNYSSA: I told him, it was exactly what we needed!\nDOCTOR: (PLACING DEVICE ON NYSSA’S FOREHEAD) So. We place it on the source of the infection like so.. Initate the process, and...\nTEGAN: What, that’s going to cure her?\nDOCTOR: It should fend off the invading organism, yes. We can stabilise her condition back in the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: If we can get past the doors.\nTEGAN: So we use the agitator on them, dummy.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, yes. —\nNYSSA: 3: What was that?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: The Witch Guard recombining, about.\nTEGAN: Which Witch Guard?\nDOCTOR: All of them, I’m afraid. All of the device in place, while I —?\nNYSSA: You go, Doctor. I’1ll be fine.\nTURLOUGH: Just a minute. Where’s Vend?\nDOCTOR: Who?\nTEGAN: Page 138\nTEGAN: I think. Nothing for you to worry\nTEGAN: it, rather. Nyssa, can you hold\nTEGAN: The last Sontaran. He was here by the door a moment ago.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: (EXITING) Tegan, Turlough — with me!\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81: EXT. COURTYARD EAST (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR WHO: 6 x WITCH GUARDS (were all except VEND): (SPEAKING TOGETHER) Soon, we will be together again! Soon! Soon! Soon!\nTEGAN: (STOPPING TRACKS) Oh my [God] — they’re all one creature now! With six heads!\nDOCTOR: Well, six heads are better than one.\nDOCTOR: 6 x WITCH GUARDS: And many hands make light work... Doctor...!\nTEGAN: Yeah, but twelve’s a bit excessive.\nDOCTOR: Fourteen, once it absorbs the last Sontaran there.\nTURLOUGH: What’s he thinking of? (CALLING) Vend! Come away from that... thing!\nVEND: (OFF) Stay back, Turlough!\nVEND: . I have chosen death! Glorious death! Death before dishonour!\nVEND: 6 x WITCH GUARDS: Come to us, Comrade Vend. Join us.\nVEND: Yes. Yes! Do it! Do it [now]\nTURLOUGH: Stupid boy!\nDOCTOR: Yes, that was the last thing we needed right now.\nTEGAN: How do you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 140\nTURLOUGH: It’s growing a seventh head! Look!\nTURLOUGH: 7 x WITCH GUARDS (now inc VEND): Together! Together... again! Whole... again!\nTEGAN: Is it my imagination, or is it getting bigger, too?\nDOCTOR: It’s not your imagination. The Witch Guard is a gestalt entity. It can split itself apart, when necessary, to ensure its survival. But it’s infinitely more powerful as one.\nTURLOUGH: And you know all this, how?\nDOCTOR: Observation. Experience. And a little intuition.\nTEGAN: Yes, but what does it want?\nDOCTOR: Let’s ask it, shall we? (STEPPING FORWARD) Witch Guard! My friends and I, we were wondering — now you’ve pulled yourself together — what your plans are, for the immediate future?\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS:\nDOCTOR: We are seven. We are one. We will use our Sontaran hosts to infiltrate their homeworld. Clone ourselves a billion times, and more.\nDOCTOR: Creating an unkillable army, I suppose?\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS:\nDOCTOR: We have haunted a hundred thousand fields of conflict, throughout countless ages. We have absorbed spear-throwers, swordsmen, infantrymen, cannoneers —\nDOCTOR: A battlefield ghoul, living off the blood of the fallen!\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: Now, the whole of the Sontaran military-industrial complex is ours for the taking!\nTEGAN: So — what? You’ve in the big league now?\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 141\nDOCTOR: Who’s next, Witch Guard? The Daleks? The Cybermen?\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: One of the most formidable warriors in all of creation, Doctor: you.\nDOCTOR: I’m no warrior, Witch Guard.\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: You have fought and won no end of battles. You have slain, and you have conquered.\nDOCTOR: Never for my own glory! Never by choice!\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: You want to fight, even now. Now you have no means to defend yourself, and no hope of escape... still, you fight!\nTEGAN: Yeah, but is that a strength, or a weakness? (BEAT) Doesn’t matter, it was a rhetorical question.\nTEGAN: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: (DISTRACTED) There is... weakness...\nTEGAN: In the Doctor? You don’t know the half of it.\nTEGAN: (FX: A GURGLING, BOILING BUBBLING UP FROM WITHIN THE WITCH GUARD)\nTEGAN: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: No. In... us. (CHOKES VIOLENTLY, SPEWING PLASMA)\nTEGAN: Hey! Mind where you’re blowing chunks!\nTEGAN: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: Weakness. Weakness! (SPEWS AGAIN)\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, what’s happening to it?\nDOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: 7 xX WITCH GUARDS:\nDOCTOR WHO: There is.. (GARGLE) .. a voice within us. Its name is.. Vend. It is saying it swallowed... coronic acid. Before it was absorbed.\nTURLOUGH: The Field-Major’s pill!\nDOCTOR: Coronic acid destabilises clone DNA. If the Witch Guard absorbed that — well, no wonder it’s coming apart at the seams.\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARD: We have... no strength, to decombine. Doctor, help us!\nDOCTOR: Nothing I can do, I’m afraid. Tegan, Turlough, I suggest you both take a step back.\nTEGAN: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because, very soon, there’s going to be a terrible mess.\nDOCTOR: 7 x WITCH GUARDS: The voice in us. It is saying:\nWITCH GUARD: Dulce et decorum est...\nTURLOUGH: It is Vend in there!\nWITCH GUARD: (HORRIBLE GARGLES) .. p-pro patria mfori] —\nWITCH GUARD: (FX: THE WITCH GUARD DISSOLVES IN A MESSY SHOWER OF UNPLEASANTNESS )\nDOCTOR: ‘The old lie’.\nTURLOUGH: Quite.\nTEGAN: (FX: PADDLING IN AWFULNESS) Eurgh, what has it done to my shoes?!? (FX: FADE)\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82: EXT. MOSSY PRECINCT (BESIDE TARDIS)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. A GENTLE PATTERING OF RAIN. SOUND OF THE DOCTOR\nDOCTOR WHO: USING AGITATOR ON TARDIS DOORS)\nTURLOUGH: Come on, Doctor. Aren’t you done with those doors yet?\nDOCTOR: Nearly, Turlough. Nearly.\nTEGAN: Yes, hurry up. It’s starting to rain.\nNYSSA: I don’t think it’s rain, Tegan.\nTEGAN: What is it, then? Scotch mist?\nDOCTOR: (STILL OPERATING AGITATOR) Nyssa’s quite right, Tegan. It’s the season for rain.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: So, every Sontaran battlesphere contains tanks, in which to grow reinforcements. Gallon upon gallon of liquid DNA.\nTEGAN: Don’t tell me — it’s raining Sontarans?\nTURLOUGH: Lovely.\nTEGAN: Yeah, I thought they were a terrible shower.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SWITCHING OFF AGITATOR) There, that should do it.\nTURLOUGH: About time, too.\nDOCTOR: (FX: OPENING DOOR) In, in!\nDOCTOR: not\nDOCTOR WHO: HEROES OF SONTAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM (CONTINUOUS)\nNYSSA: (WALKING IN) Of course, it could be exactly what this planet needs. Sontarans were immune to the moss, remember?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I rather think the ‘rain’ will cause the moss to recede, in time.\nNYSSA: Doubtless it’1ll set off any number of complex changes in the ecosystem, too.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A new lease of life, for the planet Samur. (FX: OPERATES DOOR CONTROL)\nTEGAN: You two! The way you speak.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry?\nTURLOUGH: Carrying on each other’s sentences. You’re like an old married\nTURLOUGH: couple sometimes.\nDOCTOR: We are?\nTEGAN: Only you couldn’t be that, obviously. (TO NYSSA) Obviously.\nNYSSA: (UNCOMFORTABLE) Yes, thank you, Tegan.\nNYSSA: THE END"
