Pebbles don’t usually have holes in them, do they? I'd hang on to that if I were you.\nEVELYN: EVELYN All right.\nEVELYN: We hear EVELYN stowing it in her handbag.\nEVELYN: BVELYN So, what’s at the end of the tunnel?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR If I knew the answer to that sort of question, I think on\nEVELYN: the whole I'd get into a lot less trouble. But as far as fogous are concerned, the tunnel is usually all there is. There’s often a secondary passage leading off at right angles — ah! There we are.\nEVELYN: BVELYN Hey, what was that?

Or at least I will be, once I’ve finished my Ph.D. I’m modern archaeology’s antidote to the old trowel-scrapers.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Indeed? Well, Mr Ludgate, I should very much like to see your Institute, and if possible meet the old trowel-scrapers for myself. EVELYN Did you say Lanyon Moor?\nEVELYN: LUDGATE That’s right. New to the area?\nEVELYN: EVELYN You could say that.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Well, all of this is Lanyon Moor, right across to Tremayne five miles that-a-way. It was occupied by early man right from the time of the first Neolithic settlers.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR I see.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Anyway, the Institute’s this way. We’re barracked up in an old gamekeeper’s lodge, about half a mile down the hill.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Lead the way, Mr Ludgate. Come on, Evelyn, keep up.

I’m afraid you've come at the wrong time, Sir Archibald.\" At this very moment Mr Ludgate is out there on the moor, gathering evidence for his increasingly deranged theories. He's been gone nearly half an hour, so I expect by now he’ll have spotted a swarm of UFOs, discovered the Loch Ness Monster, and solved the Mystery of the pyramids\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Do I detect a hint of scepticism?\nEVELYN: MORGAN Well, really. For someone who calls himself a scientist, that young man is one of the most credulous characters I've ever come across.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD I'm not so sure, Professor. I think we can all learn a great deal from the new methods. Who knows, this electrical business might have something to do with — I don’t know, precious metals buried under the ground, or magnetism, or something. Not a boffin myself, as you know, but I’m prepared to give the boy a fair hearing.\nEVELYN: We hear distant gravel being crunched outside.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER You can give him a hearing now if you like, sir He’s coming up the back path.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Who the devil’s that with him? Tall fellow in the most extraordinary coat, and he’s got a rather handsome lady with him as well\nEVELYN: MORGAN More waifs and strays, no doubt.\nEVELYN: We hear the exterior door opening and a general chatter as LUDGATE ushers the DOCTOR and EVELYN into the adjacent hallway.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD I hope you don’t include me in that category, Professor. MORGAN Of course not, Sir Archibald. You know you're always welcome here.\nEVELYN: Inner door opens.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Hello, everyone! I can smell coffee.”\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Um, allow me to introduce the, er...\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Brigadier!\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Oh, have you two met before?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR We most certainly have. Lethbridge-Stewart, you old\nEVELYN: rogue, how are you?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER I’m extremely well, thank you.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR You... know who I am?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER To judge by the clothes, the unexpected arrival, and the\nEVELYN: 101\nEVELYN: manner of your greeting, I can only conclude that I know exactly who you are. I take it there’s a police box somewhere in the vicinity.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR You're getting better at this, aren’t you, Brigadier? BRIGADIER Well, I’ve had some experience, haven’t I? It’s good to see you, Doctor.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR And what are you doing here?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER il in good time. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR I’m so sorry. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, allow me to — EVELYN Evelyn Smythe. Delighted to meet you.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER The pleasure’s mine, Miss Smythe. Or is it Mrs Smythe? EVELYN It’s Dr Smythe, actually, but you don't have to call me that.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Both of you doctors, eh? LUDGATE Er, Doctor, this is Professor Morgan, head of the Institute.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Delighted to meet you, Professor.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Likewise, ’m sure. A Doctor of what, if I may make so bold?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Oh, this and that. Mostly that, you know. Just at the\nEVELYN: moment I’m very interested in fogous. We were exploring yours when we met your colleague here. SIR ARCHIBALD Since we’re making introductions, ’'m Flint. LUDGATE I'm so sorry, Sir Archibald, I didn’t see you there. SIR ARCHIBALD That’s quite all right, young man. BRIGADIER Doctor, Evelyn - this is Sir Archibald Flint, thirteenth Baronet of Pengriffen. SIR ARCHIBALD Charmed, Dr Smythe. Er, I didn’t catch your name, Doctor...? EVELYN Are you an archaeologist too, Sir Archibald? SIR ARCHIBALD Good Lord, no. No, to resort to a current vulgarity, I am the money. MORGAN Sir Archibald owns Pengriffen Manor and most of the moorland around here. Not only has he very kindly let us use this lodge as our premises, but he's also funded most of our work for the past six months. LUDGATE We only get a tiny grant, you see. We’re very lucky to have a benefactor like Sir Archibald right on our doorstep. SIR ARCHIBALD Always delighted to assist a committed cause, gentlemen, you know that. I’m only sorry you haven’t found anything terribly interesting on your dig. Well, just a passing visit, I must press on. I'll see myself out. Good day to you all! ieee Good day, Sir Archibald. Always good to see you.\nEVELYN: oor. EVELYN He seems very nice.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Bit of a funny old buffer, is Archie, but we wouldn’t be here without him.\nEVELYN: EVELYN And was it right, what he said? LUDGATE About what? EVELYN That you haven’t found anything terribly interesting.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Tm afraid so, Dr Smythe. Plenty of standard fare, all good St ter ine county museum, but nothing that’s likely to set the academic ablaze.\nEVELYN: 102\nEVELYN: DOCTOR On the contrary, Professor, I think this may yet prove to be one of the most fascinating surveys ever undertaken. MORGAN Indeed? What makes you say that?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR For one thing, the contents of this box.\nEVELYN: We hear him pick up a cardboard box full of scraps of metal.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Careful, those haven't been classified yet. Don’t get them mixed up with the others!\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Where was this found?\nEVELYN: MORGAN In a cremation cist a couple of hundred yards from the tumulus on top of the hill. Why?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Extraordinary.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Not particularly. It’s just a bronze axe-head. Pretty straightforward Beaker Period stuff.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Well, I lack your expertise, of course, and with this amount of corrosion it’s difficult to be certain, but...\nEVELYN: EVELYN What is it, Doctor?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR What else have you found at the cremation site? LUDGATE Nothing out of the ordinary. Hairpins, jewellery, remnants of leather and wool. A few charred bones, of course.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Can I see them?\nEVELYN: LUDGATE What, the bones?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Everything.\nEVELYN: MORGAN May I ask why, Doctor?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Just idle curiosity.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Then I’m afraid the answer is no, you may not. It’s been\nEVELYN: most pleasant to meet you, Doctor, but I’m sure you will appreciate I have a survey to run here, and we're already badly behind schedule. Now if you go across the hall into the kitchen, Mrs Moynihan will make you a Nice cup of coffee before you go. Good day to you.\nEVELYN: pocTOR Now, you listen to me, Professor. The equipment your young colleague here is using to survey the historical disturbance of the terrain has been picking up far more than the usual background radiation. Somewhere on that moor, something is emitting phased electrical pulses. This is not the remains of a bronze axe-head, it’s a fragment of molectic-bonded dissilum corroded by the extreme cold of deep space. And if I’m right, what's happening up on that hill could be the beginning of something far more dangerous than you can possibly comprehend. Now if you don’t mind, I’d very much like to see what else you’ve dug up.\nEVELYN: MORGAN With the greatest respect, Doctor, I’m sorry to have to tell you that you’re talking utter rubbish. I know the nonsense Mr Ludgate’s been filling your head with, and he’s obviously found a kindred spirit, but I have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge so much as another minute of this ridiculous poppycock. Mr Ludgate, will you kindly see your friends out.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Just one moment, Professor. As it happens, the Doctor is\nEVELYN: a respected government employee of many years’ standing, and I propose\nEVELYN: to enlist his help in my current work.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Oh, marvellous. May I remind you, Brigadier, that you are\nEVELYN: here on an entirely unofficial basis?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER And may I remind you, Professor Morgan, what it would\nEVELYN: mean to your survey if I were to make my presence here official?\nEVELYN: 103,\nEVELYN: A beat.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Oh, very well, Brigadier. Have it your own way. But if you people get under my nose I shall be quite prepared to make an official complaint.\nEVELYN: Door.\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIHAN (Cheerily) Sorry about the delay. I've been trying to keep count of all the comings and goings. Coffee for five, is it? 7 f MORGAN Ah, the voice of sanity. Thank you, Mrs Moynihan. Tm going to have mine on the terrace while this sun’s still shining. Bring it out to me there, will you?”\nEVELYN: His voice is receding.\nEVELYN: MORGAN Oh, and Mr Ludgate, you’d better show them whatever damn things they want to see.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE Will do.\nEVELYN: Door slams. We hear coffee being served in the background during the following dialogue. .\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Doctor, Evelyn, this is Mrs Moynihan.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Yes, we met on the moor this morning.\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIHAN Indeed we did! I was taking Buster and Ben out for one last run.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE She's off to sunnier climes today, aren’t you, Mrs M? MBS MOYNIHAN That’s right. I’m all packed and the taxi’s coming at eleven-thirty. I should be at Heathrow by six. I’ve just said goodbye to the doggies.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Are they going into kennels?\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIHAN Oh no, I could never do that. No, a neighbour’s coming into my cottage to look after them. Oh, what a pretty little stone. EVELYN Do you like it? I picked it up in the fogou this morning. MRS MOYNIHAN Unusual shape. Well, 1 can’t diddle about here. I'd better get a move on.\nEVELYN: LUDGATE We expect a postcard by Tuesday at the latest.\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIBAN I'll do my best, Philip.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Where are you going?\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIHAN Greece, dear. A week in Athens to begin with, and then I’m touring the islands. I’m not half so clever as these boys, of course, but I'm so looking forward to seeing the Parthenon and what-have-you. DOCTOR I've always meant to pop back and see it now that it’s finished.\nEVELYN: MRS MOYNIHAN Strange sense of humour. Well, I’d better take the Professor's coffee outside. The taxi will be here any minute, so if I don’t see you again before I go — goodbyel'®\nEVELYN: Open and close door.\nEVELYN: EVELYN She’s a curious one, isn’t she?\nEVELYN: LUDGATE To be honest she’s a bit of a sad case. Apparently her husband ran off with his secretary years and years ago. And then I think her daughter married someone she didn’t approve of, or something, and\nEVELYN: they lost touch too. I always get the impression she’s rather bitter underneath all that enforced jollity.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Mr Ludgate, I wonder if I might see the other samples from that burial chamber.\nLUDGATE: Oh yes, of course. I'll go and have a rummage. Back in a tick. Open and close door.\nLUDGATE: 104\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR So tell me, Brigadier, what on Earth are you doing here? BRIGADIER Officially, I'm on holiday. Doris has relatives in the South- West.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR Doris?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Of course, you haven't met my wife, have you?\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR Your wife?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Well, don’t sound so surprised, Doctor. We don’t all run off with our secretaries, you know.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR Good gracious.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN What about unofficially?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER 1 beg your pardon, Dr Smythe? EVELYN You said you were on holiday ‘officially’.\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Ah yes. Well, Doris is with the in-laws up in Devon, while unofficially, and I hope you understand this is classified information, I’m down here doing a spot of surveillance.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR I thought you’d retired.\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER You know what they say about old soldiers, Doctor. Every now and then I'm asked to do a bit of undercover work, and every now and then I say yes.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR So what’s UNIT’s interest in this survey?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Well, Doctor — Doctors. Back in 1940 Lanyon Moor was occupied by the Royal Navy, for use as a radar observation post. They put up huts on the hill, but they had to abandon the site within a couple of months.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN Why, what happened?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Well, for one thing the radar equipment was completely useless — everything was permanently scrambled. Chaps from the War Office came down - experts and so forth - but they couldn’t get to the bottom of it.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR What else?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER There was some sort of wave of mental illness among the men. It seems people were just losing their marbles, wandering off onto the moors. One poor fellow even went over a cliff and ended up in pieces at the bottom. Well, not surprisingly, the Admiralty didn't want to make too much noise about it, so they quietly shut the place down and moved the station twenty miles up the coast.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN And now things are happening here again?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Well, nothing quite so serious, touch wood, Dr Smythe. But a couple of weeks ago one of Professor Morgan's assistants had some sort of breakdown at the fogou, and ended up in hospital.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR So that’s why Mr Ludgate was so keen to bundle us out of there. And now UNIT have got you hanging around and keeping an eye on things, eh?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Exactly, Doctor. Unofficially. Professor Morgan knows all about it. He and young Ludgate have signed the Official Secrets Act. Everyone else thinks I'm just a friend of Morgan’s. A retired warhorse on holiday.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR And you're living here?\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Not at the Institute, no. I’m at the Pengriffen Arms, a very good pub just down the road.\nLUDGATE: Door opens. We hear a crate full of specimen trays being brought in and put down.\nLUDGATE: 105\nLUDGATE: LUDGATE Right. These trays are all from the same cremation cist. These two are fabric, this lot’s all pottery, this one’s bone fragments, and you've seen the metal already.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR Thank you, Mr Ludgate. Evelyn, while I’m looking through this lot there’s something I’d like you to do.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN Have breakfast?\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR If you insist. Then I wonder if you could help me with some good old-fashioned research.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN Like what?\nLUDGATE: DOcTOR Find out anything you can about the history of this place.\nLUDGATE: Pengriffen, Tremayne, Lanyon Moor in particular. Local history, folklore, anything at all connected with the area, as far back as you can go. EVELYN Right. Is there a local library, Philip?\nLUDGATE: LUDGATE Nearest one’s in Penzance, but you’d be better off paying a visit to the Manor house. Sir Archibald’s got a fantastic library, and ’m sure he’ll be more than happy to let you have a browse.\nLUDGATE: BRIGADIER Yes, indeed. One of his ancestors was a genuine eighteenth-century antiquarian. There are whole rooms piled with books in that house.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN Sounds ideal. Well then, I'll go straight over. How do I find it?\nLUDGATE: LUDGATE It’s a mile or so across the moor. Actually, if you’re quick you could catch a lift in Mrs Moynihan’s taxi. (Calls) Mrs Moynihan!'” BVELYN T'll report back before evening, Doctor.\nLUDGATE: DOCTOR Good girl, Evelyn. We'll meet here at seven.\nLUDGATE: LUDGATE Well, Doctor, if I don’t get back to work, Professor Morgan will probably have a seizure. Is there anything else I can get you? DOCTOR Thank you, Mr Ludgate, the Brigadier and I have quite enough to be going on with here.\nLUDGATE: SCENE 9: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR\nLUDGATE: Echoing footsteps in a large stone-flagged country manor. A slightly echoing acoustic on the voices too.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN This is very kind of you, Sir Archibald.\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD Not at all, Dr Smythe. It is a pleasure to have such a charming visitor. I'm afraid my butler is away visiting his mother this weekend, so I shall have to do my poor best to look after you myself. The library is this way.\nLUDGATE: Footsteps through the hall during this dialogue.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN It’s a very impressive house. Elizabethan, isn’t it?\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD Spot on, my dear - 1571. The architect was Sir John Arundell. His gabled facade is the earliest of its kind in the country. EVELYN It’s a beautiful hallway.\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD And here's our famous window, you see. Five hundred and seventy-six individual panes, most of them original.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN That’s quite something. SIR ARCHIBALD The window-cleaner detests it, of course. EVELYN Has the house always been in your family, Sir Archibald?\nLUDGATE: STR ARCHIBALD Only since the seventeenth century. It was a gift from\nLUDGATE: Charles II in recognition of our support during the Civil War. Now, here we are.\nLUDGATE: 106\nLUDGATE: A heavy door is opened,\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD Some of these bookcases may be a little dusty, I fear. EVELYN Oh, I can cope with a bit of dust.\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD That's the spirit. Well, if you’ll excuse me, Dr Smythe, I usually have my little rest at around this hour. Time’s wingéd chariot and all that, you know. Do make yourself at home in the kitchens, and feel free to use the telephone of course. I shall return, much refreshed, in a couple of hours, when perhaps you'll do me the honour of joining me for afternoon tea.\nLUDGATE: EVELYN Thank you very much, Sir Archibald.\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD is departing.\nLUDGATE: SIR ARCHIBALD The pleasure is mine. Nice to have a young face around the place again. Good hunting!\nEVELYN: I hope so. A door closes heavily. EVELYN Young face! It’s a while since anyone described me as\nEVELYN: that. Oh, hang about, I should have asked him where the history books are.\nEVELYN: We hear her reopen the door with a creak.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Sir Archibald, I wonder if you could tell - (a beat) Well how extraordinary, where’s he shot off to so quickly? Oh well, I'll find it.\" Now, where are we? History, history, history - ah, History! Huropean history, military history, history of exploration ~ local history. Here we go.\nEVELYN: She opens a glass cabinet and begins pulling books out.\nEVELYN: EVELYN (Coughing) He wasn’t joking about the dust, was he?\nEVELYN: SCENE 10: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Well, Doctor, any joy?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR I'm not sure about joy, Brigadier.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Why, what have you found in the Professor’s specimen\nEVELYN: trays? Irrefutable evidence of imps and goblins?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Cintrigued) What makes you say that?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER 0h, just the local hocus-pocus, you know. Cornish pixies\nEVELYN: and so forth. They lay it on rather thick for the tourists around here.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Do they?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Oh yes. Apparently the local name for the fogou is ‘the\nEVELYN: Pixies’ Hall’. Supposed to be traditional, but it sounds to me like a bit of\nEVELYN: nonsense cooked up by the Victorians. They were great ones for all that\nEVELYN: stuff about the fairy folk, weren't they?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR ‘Up the airy mountain, down the rushy glen, We daren't go a-hunting, for fear of little men.’\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Exactly. That’s the sort of thing. A good old bit of\nEVELYN: 9\nEVELYN: bunkum.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Yes, possibly. Come on, Brigadier, get your coat. BRIGADIER Why, where are we going?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Up to the fogou. There’s something I want to take a look at.\nEVELYN: SCENE 11: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR EVELYN is on the telephone.\nEVELYN: 107\nEVELYN: EVELYN ‘And there it was —- Lanyon Moor. I knew I’d heard of it somewhere along the line. Thank you very much, Gareth. Nice to double- check. All right then. Next time I’m in town I’ll call you up and we'll have dinner at Magdalen. All right then. Bye!\nEVELYN: Phone down ~ it’s probably an old-fashioned dialler.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Have your researches been fruitful, Dr Smythe? EVELYN Oh! Sir Archibald, I didn’t hear you come in. You gave me quite a fright.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD I’m so sorry, my dear. I do apologise. I had no idea I was still capable of sneaking about at my age. Can I tempt you to another pot of tea?\nEVELYN: EVELYN No thank you. You’ve been most kind and you’ve kept me well fed all day, but I really think it’s about time I made tracks.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Would that I could offer you a lift, my dear, but I’m afraid my butler is also my chauffeur.\nEVELYN: EVELYN That’s perfectly all right. I rather fancy a breath of fresh air anyway.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Yes, I see you found the dust. I only hope it has been worthwhile.\nEVELYN: EVELYN I think so, yes. I’ve made quite a few notes, anyway.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Good. Well, Dr Smythe, you’re welcome to stay as long as you wish, but if you are contemplating a return on foot, I should advise you to set off directly. Dusk is approaching and night falls very quickly on the moor.\nEVELYN: EVELYN That’s a point. I just keep to the track, do I?\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD That’s right. A couple of hundred yards beyond the gatehouse it joins the old Tinner’s Way, and you follow that straight down to the village. There’s quite a mist rising, so do make sure you stay on the path, won\"t you?\nEVELYN: EVELYN I will. Well, thank you again, Sir Archibald. You've been most kind.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Come back whenever you like, Dr Smythe. It has been a great pleasure. Goodbye.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Goodbye!\nEVELYN: A big oak door creaks shut. We are still inside the hall.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Ah, there you are. Yes, I thought I heard you lurking in the shadows. Well, I think we may have a problem. This Smythe woman, and her friend the Doctor. They both seem far too inquisitive for their own good. Come with me; we must prepare for tonight’s experiment. Brisk footsteps, belying SIR ARCHIBALD’s supposed infirmity.\nEVELYN: SCENE 12: Int. INSIDE THE FOGOU\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER What exactly is it you're looking for, Doctor?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR I won’t really know until I find it.\nEVELYN: SU GaDISR Well, in the meantime, can’t you tell me what’s on your DOCTOR Oh, the human race, Brigadier. The human race. BRIGADIER Would you care to be a little more forthcoming? DOCTOR Folklore can tell us a great deal about the workings of the\nEVELYN: mind, the concerns and pressures incumbent on different civilisations. BRIGADIER I suppose it can, yes.\nEVELYN: 108\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Well, doesn’t it strike you as even mildly interesting that this place is said to be haunted by imps and pixies?\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER But surely, Doctor, that’s just the sort of thing that’s attached to every ancient site in the British Isles. If it’s not pixies it’s giants, or witches, or the devil turning people to stone for dancing on the Sabbath. Jolly good bedtime stories, but no more than that.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR We both know from experience that that’s not always the case, Brigadier.\nEVELYN: SCENE 15: Ext. LANYON MOOR\nEVELYN: On this part of the moor we can hear the distant crashing of waves at the bottom of the cliffs. Muddy footsteps. We hear the clunking of a well- equipped rucksack approaching EVELYN.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Hello!\nEVELYN: NIKKI Hello there! You going westward?\nEVELYN: EVELYN I'm going this way, if that’s westward. Pengriffen. NIKKI That’s where I’m headed too. I'm Nikki. Nice to meet you. Their footsteps continue throughout the scene.\nEVELYN: BVELYN Evelyn. You’ve obviously come equipped.\nEVELYN: NIKKI Yes! ’m doing the whole of the South-West coastal path. EVELYN I say. How far is that?\nEVELYN: NIKKI Well, you start up near Minehead and it goes all the way round to Dorset. It’s over 600 miles altogether.\nEVELYN: EVELYN You must be mad!\nEVELYN: NIKKI I love it. It’s my year out before college, so I thought if I don't do it now, I won’t get another chance for a few years.\nEVELYN: EVELYN And you’re just doing it on your own?\nEVELYN: NIKKI Not completely, no. I’m meeting up with friends for the odd stretch, but I’m the only one mad enough to do the whole lot. EVELYN Are you camping?\nEVELYN: NIKKI No, staying at Youth Hostels and B & B's — it’s the only\nEVELYN: way to get a decent bath. There’s a Hostel in Pengriffen, so that’s my target for tonight. What about you?\nEVELYN: EVELYN I’m staying at the Archaeological Institute.\nEVELYN: NIKKI Really?\nEVELYN: Voices fade as they walk on.\nEVELYN: SCENE 14: Int. INSIDE THE FOGOU\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Just hold this for a moment, Brigadier. BRIGADIER What the dickens is it? DOCTOR Schlangian power-cell.\nEVELYN: BRIGADIER Ask a silly question.\nEVELYN: The DOCTOR is turning out his pockets.\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Ideally what I need is some copper wire... now where on Earth did that come from? Never mind. Ah, here we are! Power-cell, please. BRIGADIER May I ask what you’re up to, Doctor?\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Somewhere in this fogou there's a point of electromagnetic conductivity. What mariners used to call a lodestone. BRIGADIER And you think that’s what’s been causing these electrical disturbances?\nEVELYN: 109\nEVELYN: DOCTOR Not causing them. Focusing them, if you like. Now, if I can find it, we might be a step nearer to understanding the nature of these manifestations. Hold this piece of wire. That’s it. No, higher up. Now, keep it steady while I wind it round this.”\nEVELYN: SCENE 144A: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY) Background effects of SIR ARCHIBALD’s laboratory — see Scene 25. We hear computer keys being typed at speed.\nEVELYN: SIR ARCHIBALD Power level stabilised. Preliminary tests complete. Switch on.\nEVELYN: SCENE 15: Ext. LANYON MOOR EVELYN’s and NIKKI's footsteps, and the clunking of the rucksack, stop abruptly.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Did you hear something? NIKKI Where? EVELYN Just up ahead — listen!\nEVELYN: Distantly, but clearly, we hear through the silent mist the baleful, hideous giggle of an imp or goblin.\nEVELYN: NIKKI What was that?\nEVELYN: EVELYN I don’t know, but I don’t like the sound of it very much. NIKKI Oh, come on, let’s get going. It’s just this fog making us imagine things. Nothing's going to get between me and my Horlicks.\nEVELYN: She shoulders her rucksack noisily.\nEVELYN: EVELYN No, wait — don't —\nEVELYN: The chuckle again, nearer this time.\nEVELYN: EVELYN It’s getting nearer.\nEVELYN: NIKKI (Nervously) Oh, it’s just a bird or something. EVELYN Nikki, I think we should go back the way we came. NIKKI I think you could be right.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Just turn round slowly, and — uh!\nEVELYN: A loud chuckle from the hideous imp which now confronts them. NIKKI Run?\nEVELYN: EVELYN Run!\nEVELYN: A flurry of movement as they start running. Muddy footsteps and frantic clanking of the rucksack. Then a piercing scream from NIKKI as the creature launches itself at her and brings her down with a thud. Another seream, which ends abruptly.\nEVELYN: EVELYN Nikki! Nikki!\nEVELYN: END OF PART ONE\nEVELYN: 110"

Your presence is quite invaluable and we're tremendously fortunate to have you here.\nDOCTOR: MORGAN Humph.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR When I get back here with my equipment, I’d be most stateful for your advice on matters archaeological.\nDOCTOR: MORGAN Well, we shall see.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Good, good. I should be back within the hour. (He is\nDOCTOR: departing) And remember — no-go fogou!\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Understood, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Door.\nDOCTOR: MORGAN (Sulking but no longer angry) What an infuriating man. BRIGADIER 0h, he can be. He can be.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20: Ext. PATH OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTE The DOCTOR closes the door and we hear his footsteps crunching on the gravel path.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (To himself) What an infuriating man. However - onward and upward. Portable field vector map should do the trick. Ill be fun carrying that down the hill...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: Int. BEDROOM AT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Knock on door.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Come in.\nDOCTOR: Door opens.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE I’ve brought you another hot chocolate.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You're a Man after my own heart, Mr Ludgate. LUDGATE Oh, don't keep calling me that. Philip, please.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Well, thank you. One of my students is called Philip.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you’re not much older than him, come to think of it, are you? LUDGATE I don’t know how old he is, but I’m twenty-five if that helps.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Listen, Philip, I think there’s something not quite right up at the Manor.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE How do you mean?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Well... I don’t know. All his servants were away. Sir\nDOCTOR: Archibald’s all alone in that great big house, and yet...\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE What?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I don’t know - I just got the impression that there was more going on in that house than he wanted me to think. Just a sort of gut feeling I had.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Well, he’s a funny old boy, that’s for sure. He’s probably the original Norman Bates. Got his mother in the cellar. EVELYN No, I’m serious. He left me alone in the library, and when\nDOCTOR: I opened the door a second later he’d disappeared. There was no way he could have got right across the hall in that time.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Well, I should think that old house is full of hidden panels and things. Nothing terribly mysterious about that.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN But it was literally a matter of seconds. I think there’s something funny about him.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE You mean you think he might have something to do with what’s been going on?\nDOCTOR: 117\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Oh, I don’t know. It seems ridiculous now you've said it. He's probably just a sweet old man. Very old-fashioned — something of which, as you might imagine, J approve.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE You don't think we should —\nDOCTOR: EVELYN What?\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Well - you know - go and have a little poke around? EVELYN At the Manor?\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Yes. Sir Archibald goes out every single morning. He’s always down in the village, chairing committee meetings for the local hunt or whatever. We could take advantage of his absence.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You mean break in?\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Well - yeah.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN That’s an outrageous suggestion. (Pause) Shall we do it? LUDGATE Seriously?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN No, we can’t. The Brigadier and Professor Morgan would\nDOCTOR: never countenance it.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Well, they don’t have to know, do they? I mean, after what happened last night the survey's pretty much on hold, so I’m free to do what I want. And you’re up here getting some much-needed sleep, aren’t you? So who would notice if we just slipped down the back stairs and popped over to Pengriffen Manor for a couple of hours? Have a quick snoop around, be back here before lunch.”\nDOCTOR: EVELYN This is criminal. LUDGATE Well, a bit. EVELYN Let's do it.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Great. I'll nip down the back stairs and check if the coast is clear while you get dressed.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Not a word of this to the others, all right? I’m sure the Brigadier is altogether far too chivalrous to let me out of this room until I'm fully recovered. Which I am, incidentally.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Mum’s the word. I'll see you in a minute.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22: Ext, LANYON MOOR\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Singing to himself as he climbs; perhaps we can also hear the pinging of the TARDIS homing device as in Mawdryn Undead) Bom-bom-bom... I've wandered up and down this particular airy mountain quite enough times already... and here —- we - are! Wait a minute... the TARDIS... it’s gone!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR Echoing acoustic as before in the hallway. We hear a latch opening and\nDOCTOR: an external door being tentatively opened to avoid making noise. Speeches are half-whispered to begin with.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE In you come!\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I'm rather glad I was too large to get through the window. I'm afraid I make a rather nervous housebreaker.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE (A bit louder) Could have been a lot harder. We should be thankful Sir Archibald doesn’t have burglar alarms.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Sshh! Keep your voice down!\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Oh, there’s no one about, honestly. Nobody here but us chickens. So, where d’you want to start?\nDOCTOR: 118\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I don’t even know what we’re doing here really. All right, you start on the rooms down that corridor. I'll go across the hall and start on the other wing.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Right. Er, what am I looking for, exactly?\nDOCTOR: BVELYN Anything that might suggest he’s got some sort of operation going on here. Incriminating letters, computer files, I don't know. Evidence of jiggery-pokery.\nDOCTOR: LUDGATE Right.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Meet you at the main staircase in twenty minutes. LUDGATE Righto.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 24: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Door.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Ah, Doctor. Did you get the equipment you needed?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Absently) Mm? No.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Change of plan?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR You could say that, yes. The TARDIS has disappeared. BRIGADIER Taken off without you? How?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I don’t know. She's either dematerialised or slipped a\nDOCTOR: dimension somehow, but either way she’s gone.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Hold on, Doctor. I seem to recall the TARDIS became invisible once before.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Oh, it’s nothing like that, Brigadier. This is rather more serious, I’m afraid. This creature, whatever it is, doesn't want me to have access to the TARDIS. I suspect it’s already sensed that I might be a threat to its plans.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Well, that's just it, Doctor - what is it, and what are its plans?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR i wish I knew.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 25: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR We hear EVELYN's footsteps in an echoing room.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN (To herself) Nothing here either. Oh, this is ridiculous.\nDOCTOR: Breaking and entering at my age. You should be ashamed of yourself,\nDOCTOR: woman. I’m getting out of here.\nDOCTOR: An ominous click as she inadvertently activates a hidden door, which\nDOCTOR: creaks open.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Hello — what on Earth is this?\nDOCTOR: As she enters, we hear the faint hum of electronic equipment and the\nDOCTOR: occasional bleep of some sort of scanning device — in other words, the\nDOCTOR: EVELYN This is incredible! What is it?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD It’s my laboratory, Dr Smythe. Do you Like it?\nDOCTOR: A gasp of surprise from EVELYN as he clicks the door shut behind her. EVELYN Sir Archibald! What are you doing in here?\nDOCTOR: STR ARCHIBALD Isn’t that the very question I ought to be asking you, Dr\nDOCTOR: Smythe?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Er... yes, that is rather difficult to explain, isn’t it? SIR ARCHIBALD I feel confident that you'll give it a go.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Well, you did say I could come back whenever I liked.\nDOCTOR: 119\nDOCTOR: STR ARCHIBALD Call me an old traditionalist, but I had rather naively imagined that you might have come to the front door and rung the bell. Well, 1 must say this is all terribly exciting. I’ve never had burglars before. Are you alone, or do you have accomplices casing the joint? EVELYN I'm... alone.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD You're quite sure about that, are you?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You can see for yourself there’s nobody else here. I came on my own.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Well, that’s fortunate. But only for me, I’m afraid. You really shouldn’t have come here, Dr Smythe.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I'd better be on my way then.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Oh no, I don’t think so. Not now. I’m afraid you've seen things you really oughtn’t to have seen. The question is, what am I going to do with you?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 26: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The question is, how can I trace the source of the energy emissions?\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Without your gubbins from the TARDIS, you mean? DOCTOR Exactly. Time to empty the pockets again, I think.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER That reminds me, I've still got your roll of copper wire in my coat pocket. Shall I get it?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Not much help just at the moment, Brigadier. Good gracious, a meta-dimensional rheostat. I wonder how long I’ve been carrying that around.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Any good for the job in hand?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Completely useless, unfortunately. I suppose I could lash up a short-range scanner...\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER = That'll do the trick, will it?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Well, it’ll be a bit of a botch-up. I'd have to cannibalise the tracking equipment in here...\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER I'm sure that will endear you to Professor Morgan no end.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Well, you can't have everything, can you? There’s just one problem.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER There always is.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Clearly this creature has highly developed powers of\nDOCTOR: Psychic manipulation. The moment I switch on, it'll almost certainly\nDOCTOR: realise what I’m up to, and set up a field of psionic interference.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER You mean a kind of jamming signal?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Exactly, a jamming signal. The TARDIS’s telepathic\nDOCTOR: circuits would have circumvented that problem, but without them...\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Go on.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Well, the only way I can do it is by amplifying my own\nDOCTOR: alpha-waves and introducing them as a random factor in the scanning\nDOCTOR: operation.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Doctor, as I’m sure you are only too aware, I am hanging\nDOCTOR: on to this conversation by my fingernails. Are you saying that this device\nDOCTOR: will need your own mental powers to make it work?\nDOCTOR: poerOn In effect, yes. But that makes it sound more complicated it is.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Isn’t it going to be rather dangerous, Doctor? Going head- to-head with this psychic creature?\nDOCTOR: 120\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Potentially lethal, I should think.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER In that case I absolutely forbid it.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Brigadier, it’s the only way. We have to find out what this creature is doing. There may only have been one death so far, but believe Ihe, unless we get cracking it won't be the last by a long chalk. BRIGADIER There must be another way...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR If there were, I should certainly take it, but there isn’t! It’s a necessary risk, Brigadier. If my suspicions are correct, your planet is in the gravest danger.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 27: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY)\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Comfortable, Dr Smythe?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Do I look comfortable?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD You don’t, but as you’ve already discovered today, appearances can be deceptive.\nDOCTOR: BVEL Will you please untie me? I'll be missed, you know.\nDOCTOR: STR ARCHIBALD That doesn’t really matter. By the time people come looking, I'll be... in charge.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You're a bit crackers, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Am I? It’s all so subjective, isn’t it? Who says I'm crackers?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I do. And everyone I can think of, offhand, would agree if they were here now.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD But they’re not, are they? Intellect, ambition, innovation, bravery, the courage to move beyond the stifling parameters of social conformity - these have always been regarded as signs of madness by the plodding majority.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You're starting to sound like Dr Faustus now. Do you know what happened to him?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD My dear Dr Smythe, religion is for people who believe in Hell. Magic is for people who have been there.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Magic? What are you ranting about now? You really are crackers, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Have you ever heard of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn?\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Yes, I think so. Something to do with that narcissistic charlatan who wrote awful poetry - Crowley, Aleister Crowley. Filed his teeth into points and called himself ‘The Beast’. He was a bit of a joke really.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD He was a prophet, Dr Smythe. His vision was the dissolution of universal morality.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Rubbish. He wasn’t a prophet. At the very best he was a cut-price Nietzsche.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law’. EVELYN Well, exactly. What kind of feeble philosophy is that? My students observe it every Friday night - it’s just an excuse for a good party, dressed up in a bit of Medieval lingo.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD You babbling inadequate. As you are about to learn, I have made rather more of it than that.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I'm sure you have, but as I pointed out earlier, you’re erackers.\nDOCTOR: 121\nDOCTOR: SYR ARCHIBALD There is power out there on Lanyon Moor. Deep, dark, primal power such as no man has ever known. All my life I have studied the history of this place, the psychic emanations, the spectre of the moor. EVELYN That’s why you funded the survey.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD I thought it might be of some use to me. But as it turns out, Professor Morgan’s scratching in the sand is of no consequence. With or without his assistance, my life’s work is about to reach fruition. EVELYN It’s certainly got something to do with fruit, but probably not in the way you think. Nuts are another major ingredient.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Your clumsy attempts at sarcasm cannot disguise your fear, Dr Smythe. My family has always prided itself in being among this country’s most loyal servants. It is fashionable nowadays for those with no sense of duty or history to despise the so-called privileged classes. Our institutions are becoming overrun by the worst kind of parvenu. Well, my service may no longer be required, but my blood cannot be taken from me so easily.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Don't let’s get above ourselves, old chum. You’re only a Baronet, you know. That makes you a commoner like me. You might think I have no sense of history, but I’m sufficiently up on the subject to know that your ancestors probably bought you your place on the lowest rung of the aristocracy.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Your envy ill becomes you, doctor.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Anyway, what’s all this got to do with Aleister Crowley? How does the dissolution of morality fit in with some two-bit lordling with a screw loose, getting ideas above his station?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Crowley, of all men, knew that his flock needed leadership. And a prophet, after all, is merely one who prepares the way for a messiah.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Oh I see, 4 messiah. And that would be you, would it? SIR ARCHIBALD Have a care, Dr Smythe. I am on the threshold of fulfilling my destiny.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Well, that’s nice for you.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD You mock me, but I smell the terror in your mind. What you see around you are the results of decades of privately funded research. The equipment in this laboratory focuses the power of my will. I believe you witnessed a demonstration only last night.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN A demonstration...? You don’t mean... it was you who caused that creature to appear?\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD I summoned it forth, Dr Smythe, and it came.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN I don’t believe you.\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Believe what you like. My experiments are complete. When the spectre rises tonight on Lanyon Moor, it is I who will harness it. Then I shall be able to create and destroy at will. To do my will shall be the whole of the law.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN (Getting a bit scared now) You really are mad, aren’t you? You actually believe all this rubbish!\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD Doubt is Devil-born, Dr Smythe. Look at that window. Now! The window shatters into pieces spectacularly. Howling wind blows in. EVELYN (Raising her voice above the wind) How did you do that? SIR ARCHIBALD (Raising his voice similarly) 1 hope your students are more attentive than you are. I did it with my mind, Dr Smythe. Shall we Put tt back together again? Now!\nDOCTOR: 122\nDOCTOR: Reversed sound effect as the window re-forms. The wind stops abruptly and all is calm, including SIR ARCHIBALD. SIR ARCHIBALD Sixteenth-century. Wouldn’t want it broken, would we? EVELYN You did that... SIR ARCHIBALD It's a pity you didn’t believe me in the first place, Dr Smythe. When forced to provide a demonstration, one does feel rather like a performing seal. EVELYN What are you going to do with me? SIR ARCHIBALD If you hadn’t already seen too much, you certainly have now. my dear. And it occurs to me that I've never had a human subject before. EVELYN What do you mean - a human subject? SIR ARCHIBALD When I was a little boy, before the war, I remember my best friend and I used to enjoy burning ants with a magnifying glass. EVELYN That doesn’t surprise me in the slightest. STR ARCHIBALD He died in Korea. But I'm straying away from the point. EVELYN What is the point? SIR ARCHIBALD Now who's being a cut-price Nietzsche? The point, Dr Smythe, is that although I am still beset by ants, I don’t need a magnifying glass any more.\nDOCTOR: You're totally unhinged. SIR A ARCHIBALD This laboratory is my glass, and with the merest twitch of my mind I can make things crackle and smoulder. Now, since it was your eyes that got you into this pickle, I think it’s only fitting that they should be the first part of you to be put out of their misery. I shall exercise the utmost discipline and boil them out very slowly, Dr Smythe. I want you to feel the benefit. Do excuse me for a moment, while I make the necessary adjustments to my apparatus. (He strides away) EVELYN (Whispering to herself) Oh, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: Int. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR There. That should do it.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Looks like the crystal wireless sets I used to make when I was a boy. Is this thing really going to work, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Should do. Now, Brigadier, I have to confess I’m not entirely sure exactly what will happen when I switch on. I might look as though I’m in some pain — come to think of it, 1 might be in some pain — but at all costs, don’t switch off, and don’t pull the headset off me. It might take some time to get a proper triangulation.\nDOCTOR: BRIGADIER Very well, Doctor. But are you quite sure this is entirely sensible?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I think, on reflection, this has to be one of the least sensible things I’ve ever done. But I have no choice, Brigadier. BRIGADIER Surely, if it’s just a matter of tracing some transmissions, we could do it at a UNIT tracking station.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR You're forgetting the psionic jamming signal, Brigadier. Unlikely as it may seem, this little lash-up is our best option. And anyway, time is of the essence.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 29: Int. PENGRIFFEN MANOR (SECRET LABORATORY) Computer keys being tapped.\nDOCTOR: 123\nDOCTOR: SIR ARCHIBALD [I won’t detain you for very much longer, doctor.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN You'll never get away with this, you know. People will stop ‘ou.\nDOCTOR: 3mm ARCHIBALD [ don’t think so, Dr Smythe. You see, they simply won't\nDOCTOR: have the willpower.\nDOCTOR: EVELYN Why on earth do you want to do it, anyway?
