Well, Brisbane, it’s a beautiful sunny morning out there, so let’s kick off with James Blunt and You’re Beauti (click)\nTEGAN: Urgh. Let’s not. (phone rings) Hello, Mum. How’s you? What? No, I did tell you. I can’t. By the time... Yeah. No, Mum. No, Mum. No, Mum. Mum, Mum, can I get a word in? I’m 46. I’ve had plenty of birthdays. It doesn’t matter. I’m going for a couple of drinks with the gang after work. I did say. You don’t listen. I do listen. Yes, love you too. I gotta go. (phone down, sigh). Happy birthday, Tegan.

Sorry, I shouldn’t be here.\nWAITER: You okay?\nKATHY: Yeah, I just needed some air. It’s been a long day.\nWAITER: You with the private party?\nKATHY: Yeah.\nWAITER: Oh, how are the cocktails? The Brissie Banger’s my specialty\nKATHY: Oh. Yeah, it’s real nice.\nWAITER: I like your kind of party. You know, more sophisticated.

I tell you that you could go out and do something better with your life, we bond a little and then, at the end of the night I give you a nice big tip.\nWAITER: (laughs) Yeah, that’s generally how it works.\nKATHY: (laughs) Yeah. Have you ever... Have you ever had to make a decision that will totally change your life?\nWAITER: Oh, er, moving to Brisbane, I guess. You know, leaving the family, starting out in the city.\nKATHY: Yeah, I mean something bigger than that. Something bigger than where you live or what you do. Something that will change who you are. Life and death.\nWAITER: I don’t think so. Here, have a seat.\nKATHY: Where?\nWAITER: Down here.\nKATHY: I'm not sitting on a doorstep.\nWAITER: All right, you stand and I'll sit.\nKATHY: Oh, what the hell. Okay, I’m gonna tell you a story.

Okay, here’s the edited version.\nJANINE: Kathy, Kathy, Katherine! So, Anthony, are you enjoying the party?\nANTHONY: Yes. Stop filming me.\nANTHONY: CYBER-LEADER: You have served your purpose, and now you will die.\nANTHONY: So, I’m dead, yeah? Don’t be sad. It means I’m free.\nKATHY: Dad?\nNATE: Dad? Dad’s grave?\nWOODS: It was a scratching, from the coffin.\nDOCTOR: 6: Get back! Get back, all of you!\nPERI: This is my Mom, Janine, and Kathy and Nate Chambers, Anthony’s kids, and this is the Doctor. CYBER-ANTHONY: There is nothing to fear.\nNATE: No! Dad! Get off me! Peri! Doctor! Dad, please!\nDOCTOR: 6: Oh Nathaniel, I’m so sorry.\nNATE: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: 6: He’s alive!\nPERI: Is there anything you can do?\nDOCTOR: 6: I can’t. We'll get him to a hospital, though.\nKATHY: There’s not much they can do. He’s paralysed.\nJANINE: But he’s alive, Kathy.\nKATHY: Oh, Janine, I need to get out of here.\nMRS VAN G: Hello? Anyone home?\nNATALIE: [OC]: A massive explosion in the Fells Point area. Police are treating it as suspicious. The dead women have been named as Janine Foster and Dominique Van Gysengham.\nWAITER: Oh. Well, yeah, that was odd.\nKATHY: Told ya. So you wanna know what happened next?\nWAITER: I guess so.\nKATHY: Well, after my friend’s mother died, I moved here.\nWAITER: Why here?\nKATHY: I wanted to er, well, I needed to get away. A friend of mine from Uni, James, he was from Brisbane originally. He brought me and my brother over here.\nNATALIE: [OC]: There’s been a massive explosion in the Fells Point area. Police are treating it as suspicious. The dead women have been named as Janine Foster and Dominique Van Gysengham. Friends and neighbours have been paying their re... (switched off)\nKATHY: Oh God, what have I done?\nJAMES: It’s okay, Kathy. Look at me. It'll be okay.\nKATHY: I killed them! I killed Janine!\nJAMES: It was an accident.\nKATHY: No! No! It must have been the egg, the conversion thing. I should have left it alone.\nJAMES: I told you to bring me all of it. Look, it’s too late now. There’s nothing you can do.\nKATHY: I'll go to the police, tell them, tell them what I was trying to do.\nJAMES: You really think they'll believe you? You'll be arrested. How are you going to look after Nate from prison?\nKATHY: I just wanted to help him. I thought if we could somehow work out...\nJAMES: They won't believe you. We’ve got to get away from here. You, me and your brother.\nKATHY: What?\nJAMES: This is big, Kathy. This is like the biggest thing in the world, ever. We've got this half of the... alien thing. With my technical ability and your medical skills, we can use it. We can find a way to cure Nate. And not just him. We can change the world.\nKATHY: Where are we gonna go? Where?\nJAMES: I’ve got some mates back in Brisbane. They can help.\nKATHY: How? They can’t get us out of America.\nJAMES: Just trust me. There’s nothing to worry about. There’s no need to be scared. I'll sort it out.\nKATHY: Basically, he just helped me and Nate move over here and make a fresh start.\nWAITER: That was good of him. And so you’ve never actually found out what caused this explosion?\nKATHY: Er, some kind of gas leak, apparently. With Nathaniel paralysed and everyone else I knew... dead, there was nothing to keep me in America.\nWAITER: So, you made a fresh start.\nKATHY: Yeah. I finished my education over here, graduated, became a doctor. Set up my own practice.\nEVE: Hello. Welcome to Chambers Pharmaceuticals. How can I help you?\nDOCTOR: 5: I’m the Doctor. Pleased to meet you.\nKATHY: It’s in the city. Have you heard of us?\nWAITER: That’s not really my scene.\nKATHY: Hmm. There’s basically just me and Eve. She’s my receptionist, right-hand-woman, PA, friend. Got an IQ of 145, got more degrees than a thermometer. Worked at some science institute just outside of Cambridge. Then a few years back she dropped out of the rat-race. Hit her mid-forties and decided to backpack across Australia. We met, surprise, surprise, in a bar, and well, she came to work for me. I’m lucky to have her. She’s very... professional\nJAMES: [OC]: Hello?\nEVE: Hey, it’s me.\nJAMES: [OC]: How’re you doing?\nEVE: Oh, you know, mad American in the attic still giving me hell.\nJAMES: [OC]: Oh, poor Eve.\nEVE: I'm telling you. She was talking to herself again up there in her office. Methinks Doctor Chambers needs a doctor herself. Anyway, you’ve remembered about this thing in the pub.\nJAMES: [OC]: Yeah. Just finishing my last call-out then I’ll be there. Say pub again.\nEVE: No worries, you spunk rat.\nJAMES: [OC]: See, you will be like us. Anyway, she’s not all bad. Made you go to this party.\nEVE: Yeah, only because she’s got no mates. Get there early and I'll get her to pay for you too. Oh, gotta go. Somebody’s here.\nJAMES: [OC]: All right. See you later, babe.\nEVE: Yeah. Oh God, looks like a nutter. See you. (phone down) Hello. Welcome to Chambers Pharmaceuticals. How can I help you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Pleased to meet you.\nEVE: The pleasure is all mine. How can I help?\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me who runs this place?\nEVE: Doctor Katherine Chambers.\nKATHY: We've been there for eleven years now. Taken a while to build up, but everything, well, it was going okay.\nWAITER: So what’s happened?\nKATHY: A woman.\nWAITER: Ah, the story’s picking up.\nKATHY: No, no. She was, is, a patient. Obviously I can’t tell you her name.\nJODI: Tegan? Oh, sorry, Michael.\nMICHAEL: It’s okay. I’m afraid Miss Jovanka hasn't joined us yet. Do you want to close the door? (door closed) What’s the problem?\nJODI: Oh, it’s no problem, babe. I just wanted to let you know I’ve updated the Parker file.\nMICHAEL: Great. Cheers, Jodi.\nJODI: Did you want to check it?\nMICHAEL: Oh, I’m sure it'll be fine. Just mail me the link.\nJODI: Oh, will do. So, er, she hasn’t come in again.\nMICHAEL: No.\nJODI: Oh, you poor lamb. It can’t be easy for you. Hey, but you’re doing a great job running the place in the meantime, Michael. Know Steve and some of the others were saying they didn’t think you were up to it, but I stuck up for you. I said, no, he’s coping fine. Oh, but you do look tired.\nMICHAEL: I am. I just wish Tegan would have, I dunno, explained what’s going on.\nJODI: You poor baby. Must be hard. Especially with the break-up as well.\nMICHAEL: Yeah, well, that’ll teach me about office romances.\nJODI: Oh, they don’t always end in tears. Anyway, I’d best be off. No rest for the wicked, eh?\nMICHAEL: No, Jodi.\nJODI: Oh God, you frightened me.\nJAMES: There’s nothing to... sorry, I’m from tech support.\nMICHAEL: Blimey, you work late.\nJAMES: Yeah, well, your company pays us top dollar to be available 24/7. So, what’s the problem?\nMICHAEL: All right, it’s the main server in the corner over there.\nJAMES: Ah, right, yeah.\nMICHAEL: Okay. Thanks, Jodi.\nJODI: Oh, right. Bye, babe.\nMICHAEL: Has anyone offered you coffee or anything?\nJAMES: No, I’m fine, thanks. What seems to be the problem?\nMICHAEL: All the phone and internet connections have gone down throughout the building. Can’t even get a dial tone.\nJAMES: Oh, right. No worries. Let’s have a look. Yeah, it’s probably the er (mobile rings) Sorry. Meant to switch that off. Mind if I get it?\nMICHAEL: Nah, go ahead.\nJAMES: Hello?\nEVE: [OC]: Hey, it’s me.\nJAMES: How're you doing?\nEVE: [OC]: Oh, you know, mad American in the attic’s still giving me hell.\nJAMES: Poor Eve.\nEVE: [OC]: I'm telling you. She was talking to herself again, up there in her office. Methinks Doctor Chambers needs a doctor herself. Anyway, you’ve remembered about this thing in the pub.\nJAMES: Yeah. Just finishing my last call-out then I'll be there.\nWAITER: So this patient, what’s she done, threatened to sue you?\nKATHY: Oh no, it’s nothing like that. Actually we get on really quite well, but she’s very ill.\nWAITER: Not bird flu. Sorry. So what, it’s reminding you of your brother?\nKATHY: Yeah, sort of.\nWAITER: Did he... well, did he make it?\nKATHY: No. No, he didn't. It’s okay, though. Time heals and all that. I’ve gotten over it.\nKATHY: Well, it’s been another busy, fun-packed day. Still, it pays the bills. We went to this nice little restaurant for lunch. Had mushroom stroganoff, which was fine, although you can have enough mushrooms. What else. Oh yes, I was talking to Bruno earlier. I’ve told you all about him before, haven’t I? The security guard? I must have done. Anyway, he said the football final’s on next Saturday. I guess he meant, what is it? No, don’t tell me. Aussie rules? See? I’m learning. Oh, Nate, I wish... Even after all these years, I miss you so much. I remember... I remember the night, the night you had the accident. I remember what Daniel Woods said to me.\nWOODS: [memory]: It’s the memories, isn’t it? They're what are supposed to keep you going. But it’s not enough for me.\nKATHY: And he was right. Sometimes the memories aren’t enough. (phone rings) Yes, Eve.\nEVE: [OC]: Someone here to see you, Doctor Chambers.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Tell her it’s urgent.\nEVE: [OC]: He says it’s urgent.\nKATHY: Has he made an appointment?\nEVE: [OC]: No.\nKATHY: Then tell him to... Then please ask him to make one.\nEVE: [OC]: I’ve tried. He won't.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: I need to see you, Doctor Chambers.\nKATHY: Eve, can you please tell him I’m busy, and that if he wants to see me he can make an appointment. If he won't leave, then request Bruno to escort him out of the building. (phone down) Idiot. Actually, Nate, Bruno reminds me of you a bit. Real strong silent type, but deep down a bit of a wuss. Oh, he was going on about the bird flu yesterday, totally getting Eve all scared. I told them. I said, look, there is nothing to fear. He took about as much notice of me as you ever do.\nKATHY: CYBER-NATE: Nothing to fear.\nKATHY: No, I’m completely over my brother’s death.\nWAITER: So what's the problem with this patient?\nKATHY: Well, it's more what I had planned for her, her treatment. It turns out that she’s friends with er\nWAITER: Oh, sorry. You sure you don’t want one?\nKATHY: No, I’m fine. You kill yourself if you want. It’s not really fair, of course. My brother never smoked, this patient of mine never did, but no, no, no, you go ahead.\nWAITER: Sorry. It’s a stressful job. Stressful life.\nKATHY: I’m sure it is. So, it turns out that this patient of mine knew... she knows this man.\nDOCTOR: I need to see you, Doctor Chambers.\nKATHY: [OC]: Eve, can you please tell him I’m busy, and that if he wants to see me he can make an appointment. If he won’t leave, then request Bruno to escort him out of the building.\nEVE: I’m afraid you will need to make an appointment, sir.\nDOCTOR: And I’m afraid this is serious. She might be meddling with things she doesn’t understand.\nEVE: Even so, you'll need an appointment.\nDOCTOR: (sigh) When will she be available?\nEVE: When you’ve made an appointment.\nDOCTOR: Fine! I'll make one, then.\nEVE: Does next Thursday afternoon suit you, sir?\nDOCTOR: What? I’ve travelled thousands of... Well, never mind. I’m sorry. We might have got off on the wrong foot. Eve, wasn't it?\nEVE: That's right.\nDOCTOR: Where is it you’re from, Eve? Originally.\nEVE: South London. I’ve been in Brisbane a few years though.\nDOCTOR: Really? How fascinating. What brought you over here?\nEVE: I was travelling.\nDOCTOR: Travelling. I love travelling. That’s what I do. I’m a traveller. I love just seeing, experiencing things, new places, new smells, new people, don’t you? Don’t you like meeting new people?\nEVE: Er yes. Yes, I do.\nDOCTOR: I’ve actually only just arrived in Brisbane, so I’m looking to make some friends. People who can show me the hot spots, you know? Where to go and that.\nEVE: Well... well, I’m sure I could... I mean, I’m going to a thing in a bar later. I’m sure if you wanted, you could... come along?\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Really, that would be excellent. Now would, by any chance at all — I’m just, you know, wondering, but — would Doctor Chambers possibly be popping into this, this bar for this thing?\nEVE: Doctor Chambers? I’m sorry, sir, but I wouldn’t know. Bruno! Could you please escort this gentleman off the premises?\nDOCTOR: Back off, Bruno. Look, I’m sorry, but I really need to see this doctor.\nEVE: Bruno!\nDOCTOR: Back off, there’s a good guard. Further. Further. That’s it.\nEVE: Right, that’s it. Come on, out you go.\nDOCTOR: If you’d only listen to me, I just need to\nEVE: Do I look bothered?\nDOCTOR: Well, no. But, but really, it is vitally\nEVE: Important? So phone and make an appointment. Now out you go!\nDOCTOR: I really wish you ow!\nEVE: What happened?\nDOCTOR: The doors have locked. Are you sure you want me to leave?\nEVE: Damn system must be... Just stay there. Oh, IQ of 145 and I can’t even unlock the wretched doors.\nDOCTOR: Never trust automated systems, you see. Always going wrong.\nLIFT: Ground floor.\nEVE: Now what?\nLIFT: Doors opening.\nKATHY: Hey, Eve, are you ready to... oh. Is that the man without an appointment?\nDOCTOR: You know, I think you’ve just summed me up beautifully. Doctor Chambers, I presume.\nKATHY: That’s correct. And you are?\nDOCTOR: Oh, just call me the Doctor.\nKATHY: What?\nPERI: [memory] And this is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers?\nEVE: Kath?\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nDOCTOR: 6 [memory]: What is it, Kathy? What’s wrong? What’s wrong?\nWAITER: Doctor Chambers?\nKATHY: Hmm?\nWAITER: Are you okay?\nKATHY: What? Oh. Oh yes. Sorry, I’m fine. It’s just... well, that’s the effect he has on you.\nWAITER: This man, who is he\nKATHY: Someone... someone I met once, in 1984. He changed my world. I suddenly found out about how there’s so much more, and people died. When he came back, it just... I know it'll happen again. It is happening. He’s in there, laughing and joking at the party. He’s in there, which means that people are going to die, and things will happen that we can’t control. That’s what he does. He takes away your control. I mean, I am 41 years old, I’m a doctor, I’m... The moment I saw him, I knew. I might as well be some little kid who’s... Oh, it doesn’t matter.\nWAITER: When you came here - to Australia, I mean — when you came here, were you hiding from him?\nKATHY: I don’t know. Yeah, perhaps you're right. He destroyed my life once, so, yeah, maybe I was hiding from him.\nWAITER: So, so how did he find you?\nKATHY: I have absolutely no idea. That’s what terrifies me about him. You have no idea how his mind works. I don’t think, I don’t think anyone really knows who he is. His world, his life, it’s not like ours.\nALAN: Doctor! Doctor! It is you, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, have we met?\nALAN: No, no. I’m Alan Fitzgerald.\nDOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Alan Fitzgerald. This isn’t Shabadabadon, is it?\nALAN: No, this is the Gogglebox.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Well, won’t be needing this, then.\nALAN: The Rough Guide to Shabadabadon.\nDOCTOR: I was so looking forward to seeing its famous Ice Caves.\nALAN: There’s no Ice Caves here. We're inside the Moon.\nDOCTOR: The Moon moon? Earth’s moon?\nALAN: Yeah. Oh, Doctor, it’s so good to meet you. Now, you’re in some kind of cricketing costume, which means you must be... you’re the fifth incarnation.\nDOCTOR: That's right. How do you know...\nALAN: So you should be travelling with er, don’t tell me, er, Adric, Nyssa and er, oh, the Australian one. Er, Tegan. Or Tegan and Turlock.\nDOCTOR: Turlough. And they're all long gone. How exactly do you...\nALAN: Or Peri, the American one.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I’m travelling alone right now.\nALAN: No, you can’t be. There’s no records of you travelling alone.\nDOCTOR: I’ve left my friends in Monte Carlo. Alan, who are you?\nALAN: Oh, sorry, I’m a bit of a fan. You see, I’m a student. Not of you, though. No, I’m a history student, but I’m working here during the summer.\nDOCTOR: The Gogglebox.\nALAN: That’s right. It opened last week. It’s like this giant museum all about Earth and its history. You can see anything here.\nDOCTOR: Anything?\nALAN: Yeah, every single media file from Earth’s history is stored here. Right here.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating.\nALAN: Yeah, I know. I’ve been helping to log everything. It’s a bit dull, but it means I get to see history. That’s\nALAN: how I know about you. You’re everywhere.\nDOCTOR: Am I indeed?\nALAN: Yeah. They reckon you were there at the beginning, when mankind discovered fire. And there’s rumours you'll be there at the end.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s something to look forward to. Anyway, Alan, I really should be heading\nALAN: You can’t go. There’s so many things I’ve got to ask you.\nDOCTOR: Must you? Am I really that important?\nALAN: Yeah, I’m a bit of a detective, you see. I’ve been studying Earth’s history and I’ve seen how you keep popping up. I’ve always liked detective stuff. Used to love Poirot as a kid. You know, all that ze drink it smells of almonds, cyanide. And Marple, and the Famous Five, I loved all that. That’s what I reckon history’s like. It’s like a mystery. History the mystery. It’s there to investigate, to try and uncover the truth.\nDOCTOR: The truth?\nALAN: Oh please, just give me five minutes. Just five minutes, and I'll show you.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, but calm down with the breathless enthusiasm, please. You‘re making me feel quite old.\nALAN: Oh, sorry. This is just so... sorry. Okay, come over here. I promise, I’ve only got a few questions. Okay, so Ill just... sorry, could you look away while I put in my password?\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nCOMPUTER: Welcome Alan Fitzgerald. You have no new mail.\nALAN: Okay. Oh, I don’t know where to begin. The first Great Fire of London. Was that you?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nALAN: The Marie Celeste?\nDOCTOR: Sort of.\nALAN: I knew it. Okay, and UNIT. You were with UNIT, yeah? The United Nations\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, but if you’re going to ask when that was\nALAN: Oh no, no, no. That’s fine. Okay. Oh, I Know, I know. Do you know what this is?\nDOCTOR: What am I looking at?\nALAN: Some kind of pattern. Energy spikes. I’m not really sure, but they appear throughout Earth’s history. Different cities, different years. There.\nDOCTOR: Baltimore September 1984.\nALAN: Yeah. And there.\nDOCTOR: Brisbane September 2006?\nALAN: And there. And there. And there.\nDOCTOR: What are they?\nALAN: Well, the media files are usually reports of unexplained deaths, mysterious happenings, mass hysteria.\nDOCTOR: Well, it sounds like the sort of thing I’d be involved in.\nALAN: I know. So? What happened? Was it the Yeti? It was the Yeti, wasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: No idea. I obviously haven't been there yet.\nALAN: Oh. If you’re in your 7\" incarnation you'd know. He knows everything.\nDOCTOR: Yes I... I beg your pardon?\nALAN: Nothing, nothing. So you don’t Know what they are?\nDOCTOR: No. But you know what?\nALAN: What?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to find out. Excuse me. Sorry, madam. Oh, I do apologise, sir.\nALAN: Doctor? Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Well, I'll go to the beginning, to Baltimore 1984. What better way to solve the mystery. I hope this isn’t a paradox. I’m only going because you told me about... Oh, so what. So, Alan Fitzgerald, are you coming?\nALAN: I'd love to, but there’s no records of me having travelled with you.\nDOCTOR: Forget your records. Come on.\nALAN: I can’t. Honestly, I can’t. I'd love to, but there’s me degree, and I’ve got loads of data still to sort out, and I can’t. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: No need to apologise. It’s nice to see such dedication to your work. I'll see you around, Alan.\nALAN: Wow! I mean, did anyone see that? That was the Doctor. Oh, he’s left his book behind.\nDOCTOR: So, solve the mysteries of Time, and then back to the ‘60s for Peri and Erimem. Let’s hope they haven't got into too much trouble. Baltimore 1984. What can we... come on, come on.\nNATALIE: [OC]: In the studio is Lieutenant Doyle of the Baltimore police.\nDOCTOR: Here we go.\nDOYLE: [OC]: Thank you. The vagrant charged with the brutal murder of father of two Anthony Chambers, has escaped. He’s believed to still be in the Fells Point neighbourhood and is on the run with an accomplice known only as the Doctor. If you see either of these men, do not approach\nDOCTOR: Oh, that sounds like I’m already there. Don’t worry, Lieutenant Doyle, I’ll give you all a wide berth. Let’s try the next one. Brisbane 2006.\nWAITER: So, this man, I take it he’s the Doctor, yeah? The one your friend has been travelling with.\nKATHY: Yes. Well, sort of.\nWAITER: And he’s back, he’s here, in there.\nKATHY: Yes.\nWAITER: Because he knows your patient?\nKATHY: No. Because I invited him.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers?\nEVE: Kath?\nDOCTOR: What is it? What’s wrong?\nKATHY: What? Oh, yes, sorry. I’m fine.\nEVE: You look like you’ve seen a ghost.\nKATHY: I’m fine. You head off, I'll lock up and Ill see you at the bar.\nEVE: Just a minute. The doors were playing up. Something wrong with the system. There, sorted. Come on, Bruno. I'll let you buy me a drink.\nKATHY: So, Doctor, what can I do for you?\nDOCTOR: I’m interested in what it is you do here.\nKATHY: We'll have to walk and talk. I have to go out.\nDOCTOR: Fine. I’d like to take a look around the building. There’s something odd happening here.\nKATHY: Oh, that won't be possible right now, but I’m sure a tour could be arranged for next er... Sorry, what do you mean by odd?\nDOCTOR: Well, Doctor Chambers, er, Kath, was it?\nKATHY: You don’t know?\nDOCTOR: What?\nKATHY: Yes, call me Kath.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Like I said, I was wondering what it is you do here.\nKATHY: I run a small surgery. It’s just me, really.\nDOCTOR: So why pharmaceuticals? Chambers Pharmaceuticals, isn’t it?\nKATHY: Oh, that. No, I’m quite well-off. I’m involved in the funding of some medical research. Cures for cancer, that sort of thing.\nDOCTOR: Ah, of course. And that takes place here, in this building.\nKATHY: Er, no. Sorry, I’ve set the alarm, so we need to...\nDOCTOR: Oh, of course.\nDOCTOR: It’s an impressive building. I mean it’s what, five storeys high, and that reception area’s bigger than most surgeries I’ve seen.\nKATHY: Oh, well, I’m... Look, I live here as well. Tell me, Doctor, why all these questions?\nDOCTOR: Because of this.\nKATHY: What is it.\nDOCTOR: Just something I knocked up to track xeno-technology.\nKATHY: Xeno...\nDOCTOR: Technology. That’s right. Extra-terrestrial.\nKATHY: Alien? Oh. No, nothing like that here, as far as I Know. I’m sorry, but I really do have to be heading off. It’s a friend’s birthday and, well, I have to go.\nDOCTOR: Mind if I tag along? I’ve a few more questions for you.\nKATHY: Er, yes, whatever.\nDOCTOR: Where is it we’re going?\nKATHY: A bar in Fortitude Valley. Bar 8687.\nWAITER: But why? Why bring him here?\nKATHY: I wasn’t thinking straight. The thing is, well, I didn’t want to be alone with him.\nWAITER: What?\nKATHY: Last time it was just a few of us, trapped, alone, no escape. I didn’t want that again. I needed others around us. I couldn’t be just trapped in my home, not with him.\nWAITER: And he’s the good guy?\nKATHY: Yeah.\nWAITER: And he knows your patient. That’s a bit of a coincidence.\nKATHY: Maybe. Or maybe there’s more to it.\nWAITER: Wait a minute. Never mind him, why are you here. I mean, do doctors usually go to patients’ birthday parties?\nKATHY: Like I said, me and her, we get on well. I don’t think she’s exactly overburdened with friends. Probably just me and her workmates.\nJODI: Hiya.\nMICHAEL: Hey. Are you heading off?\nJODI: Yeah. Max is taking Damien tonight, so I’m really gonna let my hair down. You coming?\nMICHAEL: I dunno. Oh, sorry. You nearly done, mate?\nJAMES: Yeah, yeah, all finished. Everything’s up and running again. Just sign this.\nMICHAEL: Yeah, here you go. Thank you.\nJAMES: No worries. Bye then.\nJODI: Bye. Oh, come on, Michael, you need to go. Show Tegan you can still be friends.\nMICHAEL: I’ve still lots to do here, though.\nJODI: Honestly, babe, I think Verny Food Supplies can cope without you for just one night. And you know what I’m like. I'll probably end up doing karaoke or something mad like that.\nMICHAEL: Yeah, maybe you’re right.\nJODI: You know I am. Now get your coat on and let’s go. Hey, I'll even buy you a drink.\nMICHAEL: You spoil me. Come on, then.\nWAITER: So, this patient of yours, you’ve got some kind of treatment and you’re not sure whether this Doctor will approve.\nKATHY: That pretty much sums it up.\nWAITER: Okay. So you came here. You all came here.\nKATHY: To Bar 8687.\nDOCTOR: Look, it’s very nice of you to bring me here, but I really do need to ask you\nKATHY: Give me a couple of minutes. I'll just say hello to the birthday girl then we can go back to the office and er, I'll show you there’s nothing to fear.\nDOCTOR: If we could just talk now.\nMICHAEL: Oh, sorry, mate.\nDOCTOR: Not at all. Come in, join the party.\nJODI: Oh, wait for me, Michael!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we should move away from the door.\nKATHY: Yes, perhaps we should.\nEVE: Kath! Over here!\nKATHY: Just a minute, Eve.\nDOCTOR: Well, your birthday girl’s certainly popular.\nWAITER: Hi. Can I get you a drink?\nDOCTOR: Not for me, thanks. Doctor Chambers?\nKATHY: Just water.\nWAITER: Okay, I'll bring it over.\nDOCTOR: Please, Kath, we do need to talk. We both know there’s something you’re not telling me.\nKATHY: What?\nDOCTOR: In your office. The alien technology? Your medical research?\nKATHY: You know who I am, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: No idea. But if you're...\nKATHY: Peri Brown?\nDOCTOR: What? How do you know Peri?\nKATHY: Baltimore, 1984.\nDOCTOR: Alan’s pattern. The energy spikes. What /s going on here, Doctor Chambers?\nWAITER: Your water, madam.\nMICHAEL: Everyone, listen to me. She’s just outside. Everyone be quiet.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers, you have to tell me what is going on.\nKATHY: In a minute. Shh.\nALL: Surprise!\nTEGAN: What's going on?\nKATHY: Happy birthday.\nTEGAN: Oh, I... Doctor! What the hell are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: Er, hello, Tegan. Surprise?\nWAITER: I thought your patient and the Doctor were friends?\nKATHY: I think they were, once, but I don’t think they’d seen each other for a few years.\nWAITER: So, the doo-dah really hit the what’s-it.\nKATHY: You could say that. She’s not what you’d call quiet.\nTEGAN: Doctor, what are you doing here? Because it’s nothing to do with my surprise birthday party, is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, er, no.\nTEGAN: Still haven’t fixed the Tardis, have you? I’ve got a dodgy mechanic here in Brisbane I should introduce you to. You have a lot in common.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Tegan, still the same easy-going charm.\nTEGAN: Ah, bull. Waiter?\nWAITER: Er yes, madam?\nTEGAN: Vodka and tonic, double. I'll need it.\nWAITER: And for you?\nTEGAN: He'll just have water. He’s enough trouble sober.\nDOCTOR: Am I sensing a certain hostility from you?\nTEGAN: Spot on.\nDOCTOR: Why? We were friends.\nTEGAN: Because if you’re here in Brisbane it means trouble’s on its way.\nDOCTOR: That’s a gross exaggeration.\nTEGAN: My friends are here, my family. I don’t want them mowed down by Daleks or possessed by Maras or killed by Cybermen. I care about them.\nDOCTOR: You're not pleased to see me?\nTEGAN: You know what I mean.\nDOCTOR: We had some good times, didn’t we? How long has it been?\nTEGAN: If you’d finally fix the Tardis console, you’d know. Twenty years.\nDOCTOR: And you never let your mind drift back.\nTEGAN: Australians don’t do nostalgia.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. All human beings do nostalgia. It’s your version of time travel.\nTEGAN: Is Turlough with you?\nDOCTOR: He went back home.\nTEGAN: Home is important.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nTEGAN: What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: I’m... wishing an old friend happy birthday.\nTEGAN: You don’t know, do you.\nDOCTOR: Let’s say I have an inkling.\nTEGAN: And? Come on. Is it a good inkling or a bad inkling? It’s a bad inkling, isn’t it.\nDOCTOR: I'd forgotten what a pessimist you could be.\nTEGAN: I’m not playing twenty questions. What Doctor, how Doctor, when Doctor, why Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No worries, then. That’s correct, isn’t it? That’s what you Australians say.\nTEGAN: Not when you’re around.\nDOCTOR: I think someone is trying to attract your attention.\nTEGAN: Please don’t cause trouble. Kath! Let me get you a drink.\nDOCTOR: Trouble? It’s not me oh!\nJAMES: Oh, sorry.\nDOCTOR: No, no, my fault. Guess I should move away from the door.\nJAMES: Er, yeah. Excuse me. Eve.\nEVE: You made it.\nJAMES: Course I did. Free booze.\nEVE: And there was me thinking you were here for me.\nJAMES: Oh, yeah. That too. Hey, what are you drinking?\nMICHAEL: Oh, hello.\nJAMES: Hi.\nMICHAEL: Sorry, I didn’t catch your name earlier. The net’s working great, though. Small world.\nJAMES: Yeah, yeah, it is. Look, sorry, mate. I’m just going to the bar. Can I get you anything?\nMICHAEL: I’m fine, thanks. Going to talk to the birthday girl.\nJAMES: Okay. You want a drink, Eve?\nEVE: What do you think?\nTEGAN: Who organised this?\nKATHY: I think it was someone from your work. They found my number in your address book.\nTEGAN: Hmm. Not sure I approve, Doctor Chambers.\nKATHY: You can let your hair down for one... Oh, hi.\nMICHAEL: Hi, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Mike. Everything okay?\nMICHAEL: It’s fine. You didn’t come into work again.\nTEGAN: No, I er, I was busy.\nKATHY: Oh, sorry, she was with me. We were shopping. You know what us girls are like.\nMICHAEL: Tegan, shopping? Yeah, right.\nTEGAN: Hey. Sorry, have you two met? This is Mike Tanaka. We work together. And this is Katherine Chambers, a friend from... just a friend, really.\nMICHAEL: Nice to meet you.\nKATHY: Yeah. So Mike, what is it that\nJODI: Michael!\nMICHAEL: Oh hi, Jodi.\nJODI: I think it’s your turn to buy me a drink.\nMICHAEL: The drinks are free, Jodi.\nJODI: Oh yeah. Oh hi, Tegan. Happy birthday. You're looking well. Isn’t she looking well, Michael?\nMICHAEL: Yeah, great.\nJODI: I mean, I just hope I look that good when I get to your age. (sotto) Black dress, good idea. Very slimming.\nTEGAN: Thank you, Jodi. If you’ll excuse me I really must go and\nJODI: Are you feeling okay? We were so worried about you at work today.\nTEGAN: I was shopping.\nKATHY: Oh yes, Tegan and I do like the latest fashions.\nJODI: Really.\nKATHY: Mmm hmm. But it’s actually nice to meet someone who isn’t that bothered. Actually, aren’t you cold in that?\nJODI: I’m fine, thank you. If you’ll excuse me. Are you coming, Michael?\nTEGAN: Yes, do run along, Michael.\nMICHAEL: (sotto) Help me.\nKATHY: Have fun.\nTEGAN: Good comeback.\nKATHY: I’ve learned from the best. Oh, er, I'll be back in a minute.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers? Doctor Chambers.\nTEGAN: Will you keep your voice down?\nDOCTOR: I’ve got to talk to her.\nTEGAN: Kath? Why?\nDOCTOR: Because of this.\nTEGAN: Put it away.\nDOCTOR: It’s a tracking\nTEGAN: I don’t care. Stop waving it about. I can’t take you anywhere.\nDOCTOR: Oh, something’s wrong.\nTEGAN: What? What is it?\nDOCTOR: You. You just smiled.\nTEGAN: I really wanna punch you.\nDOCTOR: Nothing’s changed that much, then.\nTEGAN: No? I... I’m sorry I just left you like that, you know.\nDOCTOR: I understand. You seem to be doing all right for yourself. Very swish bar, very swish friends.\nTEGAN: Yeah. Yeah, you're right.\nDOCTOR: Tegan? You okay? Come on, tell me about your life. What have you been up to?\nTEGAN: Well, things couldn’t be better. Got a nice apartment, running my own company.\nDOCTOR: Really? What do you do? Tourism? Something travel related?\nTEGAN: We supply animal feed to farmers.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s... necessary.\nTEGAN: Yeah. Took over from my dad. It’s not a laugh a minute, but, pays the bills.\nDOCTOR: Mmm. And what about outside of work?\nTEGAN: It’s fine. Well, there’s something. Look, we’ve got loads to catch up on. How long are you here for?\nDOCTOR: Depends on Doctor Chambers.\nTEGAN: Why? Is she... no, don’t tell me. I’m not getting involved.\nDOCTOR: You're going to stand on the side-lines, quietly.\nTEGAN: I’ve changed.\nDOCTOR: She could be involved in something very dangerous.\nTEGAN: Not interested. Just please try not to kill anyone.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, now that’s not fair, Tegan. What are you doing?\nTEGAN: Sorry, but the celery has to go. (ripping sound) Open wide.\nDOCTOR: Tegan I.. Mph. (crunch)\nTEGAN: Now eat your celery, get a drink, don’t kill anyone, and I'll talk to you later.\nDOCTOR: (mouth full) Tegan. Pah. I hate celery.\nTEGAN: Hi. Nice to see you. Glad you could make it. Hi. Yeah, I'll be right over.\nMICHAEL: Tegan. Tegan, can you hear me?\nTEGAN: I’m fine. Sorry. Bit of a sore head.\nMICHAEL: Can’t hack the pace anymore.\nTEGAN: Yeah, that’s funny. Real funny. Where’s Jodi? Of course, it’s a school night.\nMICHAEL: What is your problem?\nTEGAN: What?\nMICHAEL: You dumped me, remember? You broke it off, you ended it. What did you think I was going to do, hang around waiting?\nTEGAN: You didn’t wait that long, did you.\nMICHAEL: Of course. After you I should have just curled up and died, because nothing\nTEGAN: You don’t know why. You don’t know anything.\nMICHAEL: Yeah? Cos Miss Jovanka has to be in control all the bloody time. Oh, forget it.\nTEGAN: Kath?\nKATHY: Oh, hi. You remember Eve.\nTEGAN: Yeah, hi. Listen, Kath.\nKATHY: This is James Clarke, Eve’s partner.\nTEGAN: Nice to meet you. (sotto) Kath, what’s going on with the Doctor?\nEVE: The bloke in fancy dress? I wouldn’t trust him.\nJAMES: Why not? Who is he?\nKATHY: It doesn’t matter. Nothing’s going on, Tegan. We're just er, ah. We met once, a few years ago.\nTEGAN: Just be careful. He’s... Things happen when he’s around.\nKATHY: Oh, I know. Anyway, can I get anyone a drink?\nEVE: I'll go. Same again?\nJAMES: Yeah.\nKATHY: Mmm.\nTEGAN: I'll give you a hand.\nJAMES: So, Doctor Chambers, Eve says business has been good recently.\nKATHY: It’s all right, they've gone.\nJAMES: So? Are you ready to do it?\nKATHY: It'd be easier if you weren’t seeing my receptionist.\nJAMES: It makes it easier to keep an eye on you.\nKATHY: Oh, you mean you’re just using her? Well, how sick are you.\nJAMES: I’m not the sick one. So, that was the famous Tegan Jovanka.\nKATHY: Yeah. I’m still not sure about this\nJAMES: Stop worrying about it. Now this Doctor, is he going to be a problem?\nKATHY: Not sure. He doesn’t recognise me. I think... I don’t think he’s met me yet.\nJAMES: All the same, I’d better arrange an accident for him.\nKATHY: No! We can use him. He’s alien, James. A real life alien. When he dies, he comes back to life. And if you do, I will tell everyone what we’re doing. I will stop the whole thing.\nJAMES: Will you? Is that what you’re going to do? You owe me, Doctor Chambers. I got you out of America, I set you up here. If it wasn’t for me, the project wouldn’t be at the stage it is. If it wasn’t for me, you’d be dead. Maryland still has the death penalty, doesn’t it? You killed two women. You're a killer. Some might say that killers deserve to die. Some might say that you deserve to die. Do you want to die, Kathy?\nKATHY: Please, don’t do it. I am asking you as a friend.\nEVE: Friends? My boss and my bloke bonding over drinks. Things are good. Here you go.\nKATHY: Oh, thanks, Eve. Where’s Tegan?\nEVE: Lost her at the bar. She’s a bit er, odd, isn’t she?\nKATHY: She’s not well.\nEVE: Well, yeah, she’s not seeing you for fun, is she.\nKATHY: Charming.\nEVE: So what are you talking about?\nJAMES: Well, with you gone we decided to get all serious. We were discussing the death penalty.\nEVE: How nice.\nJODI: Oh, sorry, can I just get through? Thanks.\nJAMES: So, darling, what do you think? Should murderers be executed?\nEVE: I dunno. I don’t really care.\nJODI: So, what’s the matter with you? Oi, Tegan!\nTEGAN: Jodi.\nJODI: Are you okay? The American, Katherine, she’s a doctor, isn’t she?\nTEGAN: I think. Yeah.\nJODI: Yeah, well, it’s just that I overheard her saying you were ill. I mean, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop or anything, but you know how things like this can be. Loose lips, battleships, and all that. Oh, is there something wrong?\nTEGAN: Just go away.\nJODI: I’m worried about you.\nTEGAN: It’s nothing to do with you, Jodi. Just leave me alone.\nJODI: Tegan, what is your problem? With me, I mean.\nTEGAN: You really wanna know? Okay. You're useless at your job, you spend all your time trying to get up the ladder by flirting, you’re snide and manipulative, and shall I go on?\nJODI: Oh, Tegan, you’re so wrong. I only want everyone to be happy.\nTEGAN: Oh, just drop the Julie Andrews act, would you? Actually, you know, I’d love to stop and chat, but you're a real bitch, so if you'll excuse me.\nJODI: You're a horrible bitter old woman! (runs off)\nTEGAN: That’s it, run to Michael.\nDOCTOR: That wasn’t very nice, was it.\nTEGAN: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I think we need to have a little talk.\nTEGAN: I’m busy.\nDOCTOR: And I don’t care. What’s going on, Tegan? I’ve been speaking to a few people here, and they all seem to be from your work. They’re your employees.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: So where are your friends, your family?\nTEGAN: I don’t know. What’s it... Wait. You’ve been asking them about me? Great. So even you’ve got it in for me.\nDOCTOR: Got it in for you? What do you mean?\nTEGAN: I know. I know there’s something going on. I can see it. I can hear them talking.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, come on, sit down. That’s it. Now, what’s wrong?\nTEGAN: Nothing.\nDOCTOR: Tegan.\nTEGAN: Doctor, the reason none of my friends or family are here is because... these are my friends. These are my family.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nTEGAN: This is my life. This is what I do. I work and I sleep, and that’s it.\nDOCTOR: Oh. I thought you’d\nTEGAN: You thought I’d what, save the world, feed all the starving kids in Africa, be the new James Bond? What?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, what is it? Why are you so angry? The way you spoke to that girl, the way you're talking now. Tell me what’s wrong and I'll help\nTEGAN: There’s nothing wrong!\nDOCTOR: So this is it. This is your life. Parties with people you don’t like, meetings, supplying animal feed. I expected you... I expected you to do more.\nTEGAN: Why? Because I’m special? Because I’m so... Doctor, I’m just like everyone else here. This is what our world is.\nDOCTOR: Well, I think that’s quite depressing.\nTEGAN: Oh you do, do you? Doctor, after I left you, what was I meant to do? Nothing could compare to that. One minute I’m out there, I’m seeing everything, the next it’s taxes and bills and buying bread. This is what life is, people bitching about each other at a party where nobody really likes anyone but they’re just doing what they can to... I dunno, survive.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: It’s not your fault. I chose this. I left you.\nDOCTOR: You could, you could come with me again. You don’t have to stay here.\nTEGAN: Yeah, go off fighting aliens and saving worlds. Yeah, I could do. Except there’s a small problem.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, you could do anything if you put your mind to\nTEGAN: I’m dying.\nDOCTOR: What? What do you mean?\nTEGAN: There’s a tumour inside my head, and it’s growing, and it’s killing me. It's making me paranoid and sick. It's made me... I was going to say bad-tempered, but I was never exactly Little Miss Sunshine, so yeah, that’s it. I’ve got a few months, maybe a year. So yeah, sorry, little bit bitter, but that’s life.\nDOCTOR: No. Oh Tegan, I... I don’t know what to say.\nTEGAN: Don’t worry about it. There is something you can do, though.\nDOCTOR: Anything.\nTEGAN: Go to the bar and get us both a drink. You look like you need one.\nWAITER: So, this patient of yours, she’s dying.\nKATHY: Yes.\nWAITER: What are you gonna do?\nKATHY: I’m going out to get some air.\nEVE: Okay. Thank God she’s gone. So how long till you reckon we can get out of here?\nJAMES: Oh, not long. In fact, I’ve got the van outside. Why don’t we head off?\nEVE: What, now? Yeah, okay.\nJAMES: Excellent. Come on then. Oh, watch out.\nWAITER: Excuse me. Coming through.\nROSEMARY: [OC]: And so as we head into the evening, temperatures are dropping. Hope you all had a great day and are set for the weekend. It starts here, people. It’s six thirty on Friday September the\nWAITER: Back in a minute, Julie. Just going for a smoke.\nROSEMARY: [OC]: I’m Rosemary Stark, and here’s the Bricklayers with their new single, Westway\nKATHY: Anyway, it’s been good talking to you, but I’d best, you know.\nWAITER: Well, what is it? What’s the treatment?\nKATHY: It’s dangerous.\nWAITER: But it could save her. I served her a couple of times. She didn’t seem like the type to give up without a fight.\nKATHY: No.\nWAITER: You want my opinion?\nKATHY: I guess I’m gonna get it anyway.\nWAITER: You spent ages working on this cure, yeah? She’s gonna die if you don’t do anything, so go for it. Who cares what this Doctor thinks?\nKATHY: It probably means... it will mean getting on the wrong side of him. I saw them talking. He’s not gonna let her go.\nWAITER: Ah. And he’s the good guy.\nKATHY: Yeah. But you’re right, he doesn’t know what it’s like. He doesn’t understand our life, who we are, what we are. No, you’re right, I can’t let him stop me. We’ve, I have spent too long on this. I have got to do it. James was right. I can’t let him stop us. Thanks for listening.\nWAITER: No worries. So, do I get that tip?\nKATHY: Yeah. Get out of here. Get out of Brisbane and don’t look back.\nWAITER: What? What do you mean?\nKATHY: I’ve got to do this\nJODI: Doctor Chambers? Can I have a word?\nKATHY: Can’t stop. Excuse me.\nJODI: Doctor Chambers.\nDOCTOR: There you go.\nTEGAN: Cheers.\nDOCTOR: So, I... can’t anything be done?\nTEGAN: Nope. Inoperable.\nDOCTOR: I could, well, I could er... Doctor Chambers.\nKATHY: Doctor, Tegan.\nDOCTOR: I need to talk to you about this tumour. There has to be something we can do.\nKATHY: There is. Tegan, come with me.\nTEGAN: What? Kath, what is it?\nKATHY: I need you to come with me now.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers.\nKATHY: Not you. You stay here. You stay away from me.\nDOCTOR: What? I’m not just going to let you take Tegan away. Not until you tell me what this\nTEGAN: Thank you, Doctor. I can speak for myself. Kath?\nKATHY: I’m sorry, but I have to do this.\nTEGAN: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Put the gun down, Kath. I don’t know what this is about, but we can talk about\nKATHY: There’s nothing... nothing to fear."

You think this is going to get you a promotion or something?\nJODI: Michael!\nDOCTOR: Shh, shh. We need to think. Now, I saw the security system earlier. It’s advanced, but human.\nMICHAEL: I’m not even going to ask.\nDOCTOR: Good. The problem is those cameras up there. The moment any of us get near the place, they'll see us.\nJODI: Hmm. So we need to switch them off.\nMICHAEL: Which I’m sure with your amazing technical skills you can do.\nJODI: I’d need to be inside, but, I could have a go.\nMICHAEL: Oh well, that’s everything sorted then.\nDOCTOR: There’s no need for you to go in, Jodi. I can do it.\nMICHAEL: Except you’re the last person they'll let in. They're scared of you. I can’t see why.\nDOCTOR: Would you mind just not talking? If we could call Kath, she’s terrified but she couldn’t kill me. I think I can get through to her, stop whatever it is she thinks she wants to do.\nJODI: Well, I’ve got her number from when I organised the party.\nDOCTOR: You organised it?\nJODI: Yeah, yeah. I Knew that... oh, all right, I organised it because I Knew Tegan wouldn't like it. She’s not into surprises.\nDOCTOR: What a pleasant young woman you are. Give me your phone.\nJODI: No, I'll do it.\nDOCTOR: Give it to me.\nJODI: No. (dials) Oh, hello, Doctor Chambers? It’s me, Jodi Boyd. And how are you? Actually, let me stop you right there because I don’t really care. You see, the reason I’m ringing is that I need some money. Yep, that’s right. Money. Sorry, the Doctor? Oh, no, no, he’s still at the bar. Yeah, your mate’s done some damage there. No, no, no, I’m talking, babe. The thing is, I realised that not many people at the party knew you, and I was thinking that, well, perhaps the police — and yes, they have been called — perhaps the police won’t know\nJODI: where to look for you? Of course, they'll work it out eventually, but at the moment, well, I’m the only one who knows who you are and where you've taken that old bid I work with. So, I’m across the road from your office and I’m gonna come in. That’s right. And we can discuss terms. See you in five. (ends call) Well? That's what you'd all expect me to do, isn’t it? (walks away)\nDOCTOR: I er... well.\nMICHAEL: I wasn’t expecting that.\nJAMES: In you come, ladies.\nEVE: I can't.\nTEGAN: Here, take my hand. It'll be okay.\nJAMES: What stage we at, Kathy?\nKATHY: Getting there. We might have a problem, though.\nJAMES: What?\nKATHY: Jodi Boyd. She works with Tegan. She’s here.\nJAMES: She’s what?\nKATHY: She’s outside. She wants money.\nJAMES: Best bring her in, then.\nKATHY: You’re going to pay her?\nJAMES: Of course.\nEVE: Kath, what are you doing? What is all this?\nKATHY: I.. I’m trying to find the cure.\nTEGAN: For my tumour?\nKATHY: No.\nTEGAN: What for, then?\nJAMES: Shall we bring out the patient?\nKATHY: Yes.\nTEGAN: No!\nJODI: What the hell am I doing? (phone) Hi, Max. I hope you’ve not taken Damien out, it’s past his bed-time. Anyway, look, I was just calling to say, I dunno, just... well, just look after him and I'll see you in the morning, okay? Bye. Here goes. (buzzer) It's me, Doctor Chambers. (buzzer, door opens and closes)\nMICHAEL: She’s inside.\nDOCTOR: I think you all might have misjudged her.\nMICHAEL: Either that, or she’s really going to take the money and run.\nDOCTOR: You don’t have much faith in human nature, do you?\nMICHAEL: Wha... Forget it. I still don’t know who you are.\nDOCTOR: As I said before, I’m the Doctor, an old friend of Tegan’s.\nMICHAEL: And as I said before, it is funny how she hasn’t mentioned you.\nDOCTOR: We... I imagine it was difficult for her.\nMICHAEL: That close, were you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, actually. I wish I’d been here for her.\nMICHAEL: What, because of the tumour?\nDOCTOR: I’m surprised if you were that close she didn’t tell you about it.\nMICHAEL: You think she’d have told you? You don’t know her that well, then.\nDOCTOR: She did tell me.\nMICHAEL: Perhaps. But it’s easier to tell someone who’s no longer part of your life.\nDOCTOR: Or perhaps she just didn’t trust you enough..\nMICHAEL: No. She didn’t tell me because, because she loved me, and she knew I loved her, and she knew it would upset me.\nDOCTOR: So she broke up with you. Perhaps you’re right. So how did you meet?\nMICHAEL: At work. I’m her assistant manager.\nDOCTOR: Oh, of course. Animal feed, isn’t it?\nMICHAEL: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m sure otherwise you’re an interesting person.\nMICHAEL: And what do you do, play cricket? Or you’re just dressed like a pri..\nDOCTOR: Cricket’s a hobby. I’m a traveller.\nMICHAEL: Oh, not very secure, then. Not very stable.\nDOCTOR: No, but I don’t think stable and secure are what Tegan really wants.\nMICHAEL: Oh, I dunno. Still, if it wasn’t for the job, I wouldn’t have this car and we wouldn’t be here now.\nDOCTOR: I could have brought us here.\nMICHAEL: I suppose walking would have been the healthier option, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I have my own mode of transport.\nMICHAEL: Yeah? What is it?\nDOCTOR: Slightly more interesting than a car.\nMICHAEL: A car? This Lexus, the bloody 250...\nDOCTOR: Really? How fascinating. Does it travel in Time?\nMICHAEL: Wha?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it doesn’t matter.\nMICHAEL: Travel in Time? Oh God.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nMICHAEL: One night, a few years ago, we were out for dinner and she, well, she had a little too much wine. We both had. I asked her, I asked her to marry me. I told her I wanted us to spend the rest of our lives together, and I mentioned the future. I can’t remember how, but then she said\nTEGAN: [memory]: The future? I’ve seen that already.\nMICHAEL: And I asked her what she meant, and she said there’d been this man, and he’d shown her. She said, when she was younger she’d known known this man who'd changed her life. He’d shown her everything.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nMICHAEL: She told me some of the... I didn’t know if she was just drunk or... It was you, wasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMICHAEL: And you travelled together?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMICHAEL: In Time.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMICHAEL: So, you're the reason. You’re the reason she wouldn’t marry me. You're the reason she’s alone.\nDOCTOR: Me?\nMICHAEL: Doctor, did you consider that perhaps, just perhaps, she might have been in love with you?\nTEGAN: What is that?\nKATHY: That... this is my brother.\nEVE: I thought... you told me... he’s dead. He’d been injured and died and...\nTEGAN: That’s not human technology, is it.\nEVE: Not human?\nJAMES: Eve, try and keep up. Hi Nate, how you doing? Chatty as ever.\nKATHY: James, don't.\nJAMES: All right, all right, calm down. Listen, Kath, can I trust you to keep an eye on these two while I go and greet Miss Boyd?\nKATHY: Yes. Don’t you dare\nJAMES: Don't what, kill her? But if I don’t, she'll tell everyone where we are and we won't be able to cure Nathaniel.\nKATHY: I... You’re right.\nTEGAN: Kath.\nJAMES: Back in a minute.\nEVE: Kath, why are you doing this?\nKATHY: I want to save my brother. I wanna cure him.\nTEGAN: Look at him. He’s not even human any more. What have you done?\nEVE: And why’d you need us?\nTEGAN: What have you done, Kath?\nKATHY: There was this monster. My Dad, he was turned into a monster, then he attacked Nate. He nearly killed him.\nTEGAN: I’m sorry.\nKATHY: And the Doctor was there, and he couldn’t save him. Oh, he could come up with the usual platitudes, where there’s life there’s hope, that kind of thing, but he didn’t care. Not really.\nTEGAN: No, you’re wrong. I know him. He cares. He cares too much about everyone.\nKATHY: Maybe this one does. How did Peri describe him? Sweet.\nTEGAN: This one?\nEVE: Am I the only one not getting any of this?\nKATHY: He doesn’t remember me. The Doctor I met, it was his future. My past, his future. I’ve seen his future, Tegan, and he changes.\nTEGAN: Well, we all change. Trust me, if there was anything he could have done, he would have done it. Seriously, trust me on this.\nKATHY: Oh. Oh, he helped. He left behind some of the alien technology.\nTEGAN: And you’ve used that to... to do that to your brother.\nKATHY: I was experimenting with it. Technology’s not really my thing. I can’t even set the DVD-R. That’s why... I'll show you. Come here.\nEVE: Tegan, don’t.\nKATHY: Hey, Nate. This is Tegan. She’s gonna help us. Look here.\nTEGAN: What is it?\nKATHY: Half of the conversion device.\nTEGAN: Oh, my God. He’s becoming a Cyberman!\nKATHY: He’s becoming the future.\nTEGAN: Half? It’s only half of it?\nKATHY: Yes. This is the half I’d taken to James. He was good with computers and all that, and I thought he might be able to help. I wasn’t sure I trusted him though, so I left the other half at home.\nTEGAN: And?\nKATHY: It... There was an explosion. People died. They died because of me. Because of the Doctor.\nTEGAN: Does, does he know?\nKATHY: No. But if I tell him, he might be able to change it, stop it happening.\nTEGAN: I’m sorry, but he won’t. He can’t change history. Not his own, not to save someone. I know this happens in his future, but I’d guess the rules will be the same. Trust me, he won't.\nKATHY: Yeah. Yeah, I figured that. That’s why I need you.\nTEGAN: Kath, you’ve got to let go. You can’t just... Look, I know what he’s like. I know what life is like with him. You’ve got to move on. You've got to leave it all behind you and move on.\nKATHY: I can’t.\nMICHAEL: She couldn't let go. I dunno quite what you did, but she couldn't let go. Oh, she tried to. She took over her dad’s company, she threw herself into it. It’s like er, it’s like she knew her life would never be that exciting again, so she blocked it out. Do you know, she wouldn’t even go on holiday. I can see why now. I mean, the Gold Coast isn’t that exciting when you’ve been to the future.\nDOCTOR: And now she’s dying.\nMICHAEL: I can let her.\nDOCTOR: No, we can help her. We will help her.\nMICHAEL: You’re the Doc (phone rings) It’s Jodi. Hello?\nJODI: [OC]: I’m in the reception area. I'll keep my phone on. I had a look at the camera on my way in. If the red light goes out, that mean’s I’ve done it.\nLIFT: [OC]: Doors opening.\nJAMES: [OC]: Good evening. Welcome to Chambers Pharmaceuticals.\nJAMES: How can I help?\nJODI: Hi. Nice to meet you again.\nJAMES: I believe you want money.\nJODI: Yes, please.\nJODI: Put the gun away. Someone knows I’m here. I’ve told them that if I don’t call in ten minutes, they’re to call the police and tell them where I am.\nJAMES: Oh, right. Well, I've got something to show you.\nJODI: Ooo, something big?\nJAMES: Into the lift with you.\nJODI: Are we going up or are we going down?\nJAMES: We're going right to the top.\nJODI: Sounds fun.\nLIFT: Doors closing. Going up.\nTEGAN: So, what’s your plan?\nKATHY: I can’t tell you. James told me not to.\nTEGAN: For God’s sake, Kath. You don’t do everything he tell you, do you?\nKATHY: He saved me. He saved Nate. He got us out of America.\nTEGAN: Yeah, and? Doesn’t mean you can’t have a mind of your own.\nKATHY: I do! I want to do this. I’ve got to.\nTEGAN: Do what? You're a good person, a good doctor, a friend. Who knows, I might agree with what you wanna do. I mean, helping cure your brother, that’s a good thing. Tell me, and I might be able to help.\nEVE: Kath? Doctor Chambers?\nKATHY: I’m sorry, Eve.\nEVE: No. No, I want to help as well.\nKATHY: But that’s it. That’s why you’re here.\nEVE: What? What do you mean?\nKATHY: We need you, Eve. When you walked into my life, I thought I’d hit pay dirt. We... I need that marvellous mind of yours. You’re gonna be part of the system.\nLIFT: Fifth floor. Doors opening.\nJAMES: After you.\nJODI: Thank you. Where are we?\nJAMES: This is my er, computer room. What do you think?\nJODI: It’s very impressive. All these machines, they look very... advanced. Superior.\nJAMES: Yeah. Do you know what they are?\nJODI: I’ve no idea. I don’t really know much about computers.\nJAMES: I call it my system. Everything is controlled from here. The lifts, the doors, the security cameras, the surgery, everything.\nJODI: What, everything in the building? Oh, that’s pretty cool.\nJAMES: Oh, not just everything in the building. You see, I’m a bit of an expert when it comes to computers and phones.\nJODI: Really? You don’t look like\nJAMES: A geek? No, I guess I don’t. The thing is, do you remember what I was doing when we met earlier?\nJODI: You fixed Michael’s server. The phone lines were down.\nJAMES: [OC]: That’s right.\nDOCTOR: What’s happening? Give me the phone.\nMICHAEL: Shh! Listen.\nJAMES: [OC]: You see, I really am quite good with all this stuff. Over the last couple of years I’ve been going around fixing phones and computer networks all across the city.\nJODI: [OC]: So?\nJAMES: [OC]: So\nJAMES: I must have fixed oh, a good two or three hundred servers by now. But the thing is, I do like to leave my mark. That’s one of the reasons I’m helping Doctor Chambers. To know I'll be remembered. So yeah, every time I fix one of the networks I left a little addition. An extra. A patch.\nJODI: What’s a patch?\nJAMES: I'll keep it simple for you. It’s something I created a while back. I’ve been leaving them in servers and, well, from this computer here I can send a message that causes them to shut down the communication system, overload them. Stop them functioning. But not only that, the electronic signal then travels down the phone line and disrupts any other network it comes into contact with.\nJODI: What, like a computer virus?\nJAMES: That’s right. So, you see, Miss Boyd, if I press this key, most of Brisbane’s communications networks will just stop working.\nJAMES: [OC]: Which could make it difficult for your friend to call the police.\nMICHAEL: Damn. Get out of there, Jodi.\nJODI: [OC]: Oh, come on, get with it. Mobiles?\nDOCTOR: Never mind that, switch off the security cameras.\nJAMES: [OC]: Oh I hadn’t thought of that.\nJAMES: Except, what will everyone do when their phones go down? No land-lines, no internet, and you know what people are like in this day and age. Just a few minutes without e-mail and there'll be panic. You know, I think what they'll try and do is call for help. On their mobiles. So, they’ll use their mobiles, which’'ll activate their GPS systems and my little virus locks onto those as well.\nJODI: My God. That would drive everyone to distraction. It'd be like losing your sight. Yeah\nJODI: [OC]: Just look at the city. Nice view, by the way. Yeah, it’d definitely drive them to distraction.\nDOCTOR: Oh, very clever. Come on, Mike, she needs us to cause a distraction.\nMICHAEL: Like what?\nEVE: What?\nKATHY: Eve, didn’t you ever want to be more than a receptionist?\nEVE: No.\nKATHY: Come on, you must have done. Don’t you ever wonder what it must be like to save a life, to make people better?\nEVE: No. Quite happy as just a receptionist, thanks. Although you can take it as read that I’m handing in my notice here.\nTEGAN: Kath, what do you mean, she’s gonna be part of the system?\nKATHY: The thing is, we all are, really. I mean we're all linked in some way. It’s like a pattern.\nTEGAN: Kath, look at me. That’s it. Look at me and think about this. Are you planning on killing Eve?\nEVE: Oh yeah, give her ideas.\nTEGAN: Kath?\nKATHY: As a person, as a human being, she will die, but her soul will live on.\nTEGAN: In the system.\nKATHY: Exactly.\nTEGAN: It'll kill her. She’s gonna die so you can save your brother. Do you think that’s fair? Do you think that’s right?\nKATHY: It’s not just Nate.\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nKATHY: She'll save everyone. We'll all live. Think about it. No more grief, no more funerals, no wondering what happens next. We'll all live forever.\nTEGAN: Yeah, mad as a box of frogs. Kath!\nKATHY: What?\nEVE: Blimey, good punch.\nTEGAN: Yeah, it was full of aggro. Now come on.\nTEGAN: CYBER-NATE: Halt.\nTEGAN: Just like the old days. Nate, was it? Look after your sister.\nTEGAN: CYBER-NATE: Halt.\nTEGAN: No? Fine. Eve!\nEVE: What?\nTEGAN: Run!\nMICHAEL: Are you sure this will work?\nDOCTOR: Not in the slightest. Now hit it!\nMICHAEL: Ow! Nothing.\nDOCTOR: Try again. You’ve plenty of weight on you. There’s a sticker saying the van has an alarm, so of course why would it work? Human technology. It’s a wonder you made it out of the swamps.\nMICHAEL: Ow! You think you’re so good, you try it.\nDOCTOR: Get out of the way. Ow! Who knew vandalism could be so painful.\nMICHAEL: I'll try smashing the windscreen.\nDOCTOR: What with?\nMICHAEL: Er, I'll kick it, like in karate.\nDOCTOR: You know karate?\nMICHAEL: Watched the films.\nDOCTOR: Let me try.\nMICHAEL: Do you know karate?\nDOCTOR: Venusian aikido. Highly advanced. You wouldn't be able to do it. Ow!\nMICHAEL: Oh yeah, cos us humans can’t manage falling over like that.\nDOCTOR: This is ridiculous.\nMICHAEL: Just keep on trying.\nDOCTOR: Ah! And again!\nMICHAEL: Maybe it’s broken.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMICHAEL: You could blow it up.\nDOCTOR: I'd rather not. Think, think, think.\nMICHAEL: How’s Jodi getting on?\nDOCTOR: I'll check.\nJODI: [OC]: You could stop it all?\nJAMES: [OC]: Oh yeah. In fact, here goes. There we go. Every phone in Brisbane, kaput.\nJODI: [OC]: Oh.\nJAMES: [OC]: Yeah. Which kind of makes you dispensable (beep!)\nDOCTOR: They’ve gone. Her phone’s dead.\nMICHAEL: Damn! This stupid van.\nDOCTOR: You did it! Quickly, down here. There’s your distraction, Jodi.\nJAMES: What? That’s my van! (runs out) Who’s down there?\nJODI: Come on.\nJAMES: Show yourselves. I can see you’re hiding.\nJODI: (typing) Come on, come on.\nJAMES: Don’t make me come down there.\nJODI: Got it.\nDOCTOR: That’s it. The lights have gone out. The cameras are off.\nMICHAEL: Let’s just hope she’s unlocked the doors. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Wait, wait, wait. He’s still at the window. Go on, go back. Turn around, go on, that’s it. Go!\nJAMES: Must be kids. What are you doing?\nJODI: Nothing.\nJAMES: Move away from the keyboard.\nJODI: Honestly, I didn’t do anything.\nJAMES: Right, you’re coming with me.\nJODI: Where to? Look, just give me my money and I'll go.\nJAMES: The phones are down. Nobody’s going to the police, nobody’s going to rescue you, and you’re not getting any money.\nJODI: No, I don’t believe you.\nJAMES: I don’t care. Now move.\nJODI: Where are we going?\nJAMES: Back to the lift so we can join the others.\nLIFT: Doors opening.\nJAMES: In you go.\nJODI: What are you waiting for?\nJAMES: I’ve changed my mind. Sorry.\nJODI: What?\nJAMES: Bye, bye.\nLIFT: + JAMES: Doors closing. Going down.\nTEGAN: Come on, this way.\nEVE: Oh! Get off me! Let me go!\nTEGAN: Damn!\nEVE: Don't leave me, please. Tegan!\nTEGAN: It’s all right. I’m not gonna leave you.\nJAMES: Glad to hear it. Nathaniel, let her go. Now, what have you done to Doctor Chambers?\nTEGAN: She'll be fine. See?\nJAMES: Good. Eve, do your job and assist your employer.\nEVE: You’re mad. Don’t you think the police will come...\nJAMES: The police? They’re being kept busy, I’m afraid, ladies. No one’s coming to help you.\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on.\nMICHAEL: We should have taken the stairs.\nDOCTOR: This will be quicker, when it gets here.\nLIFT: Doors opening.\nMICHAEL: Jesus. Jodi? Oh my God.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nMICHAEL: You’re sorry? She’s... and you’re sorry? Is this what you used to put Tegan through?\nDOCTOR: Sadly, yes. Daily.\nJAMES: Come on, Kath, get with it.\nKATHY: Oh, how could you, Tegan? We just wanna help everyone.\nTEGAN: Yeah, by killing Eve. I don’t get it, wny you need me. You didn’t know about me and the Doctor.\nJAMES: You'll find out. Kath, is the interface set up?\nKATHY: Yeah, it’s all ready.\nJAMES: Good. Well, Eve, it’s been fun.\nEVE: Please, just let me go. I don’t want... I don’t want to die.\nJAMES: That’s really rather selfish. You'll be saving the lives of millions. Nathaniel, take her.\nTEGAN: Let her go. Get off her.\nJAMES: Get off him, Miss Jovanka, or I will shoot you.\nTEGAN: You need me alive.\nJAMES: If you don’t get off him, I'll shoot Eve. We can always find someone else to do her job.\nEVE: Just let go, Tegan. There’s nothing you can do.\nTEGAN: I know.\nJAMES: That’s better. Nathaniel, take her to the interface and plug her in.\nKATHY: Eve, it won't hurt. I promise. It’s okay, Nate. You can let go of her.\nEVE: (crying) What’s gonna happen?\nKATHY: The alien technology, it controls people, but it also helps them. It revitalises them, keeps them alive. No death. James and I have spent the last few years working on it, trying to create something that we can use. It'll be like... like a fully-staffed hospital. It'll diagnose the patient’s illness and treat it, cure it, make them all better. The problem is that the original technology needed a human component. It needs someone to control it, to be a part of it.\nEVE: Me?\nKATHY: Yes. You'll be the... You'll be the saviour of everyone. Thank you, Eve. Thank you so much.\nTEGAN: Don’t do this, Kath. Don’t do it.\nJAMES: Quiet. Well, Doctor Chambers? Turn her on.\nDOCTOR: No!\nTEGAN: Mike! Doctor! Where’ve you been?\nMICHAEL: What are they doing?\nKATHY: System initiated.\nDOCTOR: You idiot! Stop this now!\nKATHY: It’s too late. It’s happening. It’s finally happening. I’m going to save them all.\nDOCTOR: What have you done?\nJAMES: Just listen.\nSYSTEM: (Eve) System version one is online. Help is on its way.\nROSEMARY: [OC]: We interrupt this broadcast for some breaking news. The city’s telephone system has been hit by some kind of electronic attack. The entire network has gone down causing disruption to many homes and businesses, and sparking fears of a terrorist attack. Despite pleas for calm, a number of incidents have already broken out.\nJAMES: Right, in you go. Doctor Chambers just needs to run some tests.\nDOCTOR: If you’d just listen to me... (door closes) or not. Tegan, how are you?\nTEGAN: I’m... oh, I’m just fine. Thanks. No, really, thanks for this. Best birthday ever.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: And why have you come here?\nMICHAEL: To find you. We drove the Doctor.\nTEGAN: We?\nMICHAEL: Jodi.\nTEGAN: She’s dead, isn’t she?\nMICHAEL: How do you...\nTEGAN: Based on past experience. And now Eve. Well done, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, believe me, I’m sorry about what’s happened, but it’s not my fault.\nTEGAN: Apparently it is. You met Kath in the future. Well, your future, her past.\nDOCTOR: You'd better tell me what you know.\nKATHY: System? System, can you hear me?\nSYSTEM: Yes, Doctor Chambers. How can I be of assistance?\nKATHY: I need you... I need you to perform a self-diagnostic.\nSYSTEM: Working.\nKATHY: Oh James, it’s working. It’s really working!\nJAMES: Of course it is. My skills, your ability, the technology. We've done it.\nKATHY: I can save Nate. I can save everyone!\nMICHAEL: This is the future.\nDOCTOR: My own future. This could get complicated.\nTEGAN: Tell me about it.\nMICHAEL: I don't... Is it true?\nDOCTOR: What's the matter, Mister Tanaka? Still struggling to get your head around it all?\nTEGAN: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Sorry. We need to stop this. That technology, I recognise it.\nTEGAN: It’s Cybermen, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: It’s incredibly advanced, and, well, I think it might be more than that. There was something... Either way, it shouldn’t be here, not in 2006. You’re not ready for it.\nTEGAN: This is something I didn’t think I'd ever have to say again, but there’s something I still don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s like you’ve never been away.\nTEGAN: Watch it. No, what I don’t get is this. Why me? What’s so special about me?\nDOCTOR: Oh, there’s quite a few things I can think of.\nMICHAEL: Yes, well, it must be something to do with your tumour.\nKATHY: Doctor, Tegan.\nMICHAEL: Don’t mind me, I’m just a fifth wheel.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers, I keep saying this, but we really must talk.\nKATHY: Oh, we will. Later. First I need Tegan to come with me.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s not going to happen.\nTEGAN: What do you want, Kath?\nKATHY: You’re going to be System’s first patient.\nTEGAN: Right. Why?\nKATHY: Because you're ill, sick.\nTEGAN: Yeah? So are lots of people around here. Your friend James isn’t the sanest man I’ve ever met. Why me?\nKATHY: Because of your tumour. Actually, I should have realised. About you and the Doctor, I mean. That probably explains it.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nKATHY: Tegan, your tumour. I think it’s alien.\nTEGAN: + DOCTOR: What?\nKATHY: I knew, the first time I examined you, I have never seen anything like it before.\nTEGAN: Oh God. Tell me, how long has it been there? How long has it been inside my head?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Tegan.\nKATHY: The tumour’s been growing inside of you for, well, probably over twenty years.\nDOCTOR: No.\nTEGAN: Over twenty years? I never could get you out of my head, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’m so sorry.\nMICHAEL: You mean, you got it when you were travelling with him?\nTEGAN: Looks like it. That’s the thing about travelling with the Doctor. You get to see so much, experience so much, but there are risks. I mean, how many times was I taken over, or knocked out, or... I’m surprised I’m not more damaged.\nDOCTOR: I need to examine you, to try and find out what it is.\nTEGAN: Does it matter? It’s gonna kill me anyway.\nKATHY: This is why you are here, why I gathered you all together. System can cure you.\nDOCTOR: I can cure her.\nTEGAN: No. I mean, thanks both of you for the offer, but no more. I don’t want any other alien thing in my head. Not again.\nDOCTOR: You're being very brave, but I need to\nTEGAN: No. Doctor, I’m choosing this. I chose to travel with you. All right, not at first, but eventually. And you know what else? Life back here hasn’t been that bad. I know you thought I’d do more, but I’ve been happy. I’ve enjoyed it. It’s been normal, and that’s all I want now. I make my own choices.\nKATHY: Not this time. I need you. System needs the knowledge. This isn’t just about you, this is about Nate.\nTEGAN: Kath, I’m sorry about you and your brother, really I am, but this is wrong. You need to accept that. You need to accept what’s happened.\nKATHY: I... I can’t.\nJAMES: What’s keeping you?\nKATHY: She doesn’t want our help.\nJAMES: Really? Oh. Well, we'll cancel the whole project then.\nKATHY: What?\nJAMES: Come with me, Miss Jovanka. Obviously, if you don’t, Ill kill your boyfriend and then the Doctor.\nKATHY: The Doctor.\nJAMES: What?\nKATHY: James, we could take the Doctor instead.\nJAMES: What do you mean?\nKATHY: He knows everything. If we get System to look into his mind... oh, my God.\nJAMES: What?\nKATHY: He... he died, and he came back to life. Peri saw it happen.\nTEGAN: Peri? I saw it happen.\nDOCTOR: Please, Doctor Chambers, you can’t say things like that. I can’t know about my own future. It could change your history and, well, where’s the fun in knowing what’s going to happen.\nKATHY: Think about it, James. Instead of just being able to cure anything, System can bring the dead back to life.\nJAMES: You know, that’s a good idea. Come on, Doctor.\nTEGAN: No, I'll go.\nMICHAEL: No, you won't.\nDOCTOR: No, Tegan, I'll go. If this is my fault, then it’s up to me to sort it out. Doctor Chambers, Mister Clarke, I believe I finally have an appointment.\nTEGAN: Doctor. (door closed and locked) Doctor.\nMICHAEL: Tegan.\nTEGAN: We can’t just let this happen.\nMICHAEL: I don’t think we’ve any choice.\nDOCTOR: So, you're going to gather all the information you can from my mind and then what?\nJAMES: We'll have created the ultimate medical computer. It'll know everything.\nDOCTOR: One thing. I Know why you are doing this, Kath, but what about you, James?\nJAMES: I work for humanity.\nDOCTOR: Do you? So do I. Pay’s not too good, is it? Really, who do you work for?\nJAMES: An organisation. We find xenotechnology and make use of it. This is my special project.\nDOCTOR: And what about this chap? One of your special projects?\nKATHY: That’s my brother. You’re responsible for him being like this.\nDOCTOR: Oh. I’m sorry. Quick question for you, Kath, before I go under. When I meet you in the future — sorry, my future, your past — when I meet you, do I recognise you?\nKATHY: I... I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: Think about it. It’s important.\nKATHY: No, you don’t. Or, well, would you let this happen? You know what happens to me, to my brother.\nDOCTOR: I'd have to be careful. If I did recognise you, I’d know that changing what happened could change my own past, could change what happens to me now, but I can’t imagine I’d be able to stand by and just let it happen. I tend to get involved, you see.\nKATHY: Well, you do let it happen.\nDOCTOR: So I don’t remember any of this. I forget everything.\nKATHY: I don’t know! Look, it’s time for you to be examined. No more questions.\nJAMES: It’s time for you to be connected to System. System, are you ready?\nSYSTEM: Yes, Mister Clarke. Place the patient on the bed and I will begin the examination.\nDOCTOR: Poor Eve. She was so full of life, wasn’t she? But then, this is what happens when you play around with things you don’t understand. Let’s hope it doesn’t happen to you as well.\nJAMES: Just get on the bed, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s quite comfy, actually. Okay, System, reel me in. Bye, bye, Doctor Chambers. See you in the future.\nKATHY: Nate, do you understand what’s happening? With the Doctor's knowledge in System, we can bring you back.\nDOCTOR: Hello, System.\nSYSTEM: Hello, Doctor. The gathering has begun. Prepare to be examined.\nDOCTOR: One question. The technology that created you, there’s Time Lord there, isn’t there?\nSYSTEM: That is correct. A mixture of Cyber and Gallifreyan technology.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. System, I’m afraid I’m really rather concerned.\nSYSTEM: Please clarify.\nDOCTOR: It would appear that in the future, according to Doctor Chambers, I lose my memory. I don’t know why, but something must happen, so I need you to fix me.\nSYSTEM: Please clarify.\nDOCTOR: At some point in my future I’m going to meet her and I need you to install a trigger in my mind, something that will remind me.\nDOCTOR: 6: I’m sure I know her from somewhere.\nPERI: Kathy?\nDOCTOR: Can you do that?\nSYSTEM: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. Nothing too complicated, a simple phrase will do. Something that, no matter what happens, the trigger will always be in my mind. That’s it, something I can mentally project into Kathy, to anyone I meet while she’s around. Something to remind me about all this.\nSYSTEM: I can do that, Doctor. As some of my components were created by your own people, I can use them to boost your own telepathic ability.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. Right, let’s... Well, I’m not likely to forget meeting Tegan again, so use the name of the bar. 8687.\nSYSTEM: Processing.\nTEGAN: [memory]: Doctor. Doctor.\nKATHY: [memory]: A bar in Fortitude Valley, bar 8687.\nTEGAN: [memory]: What the hell are you doing here?\nJAMES: What information’s it getting?\nKATHY: System hasn’t started yet. They must be talking.\nJAMES: Well, command it to start retrieving his knowledge. We need to know his secrets.\nTEGAN: We can't just sit here doing nothing.\nMICHAEL: Tegan, tell me something.\nTEGAN: What?\nMICHAEL: Did you ever love me?\nTEGAN: Yeah, of course.\nMICHAEL: Then why didn’t you tell me about the tumour?\nTEGAN: Well, I didn’t want that to be how you saw me. You know, I didn’t want to be a victim.\nMICHAEL: (laughs) You? Oh yes, cos that’s how I see you.\nTEGAN: You know what I mean. It’s how he’d have seen me.\nMICHAEL: The Doctor? Tegan, I’m not him. And to be honest, I don’t care about what happened with you two. I don’t care about how you had such a wonderful time all them years ago. I care about you. I want to be with you.\nTEGAN: Oh, don't. I think I’m gonna cry.\nMICHAEL: I’m serious.\nTEGAN: I know. I know. It’s just... Look, let’s rescue the Doctor and then\nMICHAEL: Can we talk?\nTEGAN: Talking wasn’t what I had in mind.\nMICHAEL: Oh.\nDOCTOR: System, have you done it?\nSYSTEM: My programme was interrupted. Doctor Chambers has instructed me to begin your examination.\nDOCTOR: Very well. One last thing. Wait, just before you start, make me a promise.\nSYSTEM: I am a machine. I cannot make promises.\nDOCTOR: You're more than a machine. You’re a cybernetic\nSYSTEM: I must begin the examination.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me! System, I can close my mind to you.\nSYSTEM: How?\nDOCTOR: I can shut down my entire body. I can die right here, right now. Do you want that?\nSYSTEM: Negative.\nDOCTOR: Then listen to me. Whatever happens to me, whatever state this process leaves me in, you must help Tegan. You must find a cure for Tegan Jovanka.\nSYSTEM: That is my function.\nDOCTOR: You'll make sure she’s safe?\nSYSTEM: I shall... try.\nDOCTOR: Fine. Anything else? No, can’t think of anything. I don’t suppose Eve is still in there, is she? Is it worth me appealing to your better nature?\nSYSTEM: Negative.\nDOCTOR: I can’t fight my way out, can’t talk my way out. Let’s hope Peri and Erimem argh!\nJAMES: So, are we getting anything?\nKATHY: God, look.\nJAMES: So much data.\nKATHY: His body, his mind. What are you doing?\nJAMES: Making a back-up.\nKATHY: Of the data?\nJAMES: Of System. Of everything.\nKATHY: I wonder how he’s getting on?\nMICHAEL: Got any ideas?\nTEGAN: Just one. It’s the oldest trick in the book, though.\nMICHAEL: What is it?\nTEGAN: I guess it’s more believable this time, though. How are you at screaming?\nMICHAEL: It’s been a while.\nKATHY: No.\nJAMES: What is it?\nKATHY: The data. I think we're killing him.\nJAMES: You mean, this could be it? This could be when he changes.\nKATHY: Oh, my God.\nKATHY: This is it. What was that?\nJAMES: Switch on the monitors.\nMICHAEL: [OC]: Oh God! Tegan! Wake up! Oh no!\nKATHY: She’s collapsed.\nJAMES: So? With the Doctor’s knowledge, we don’t need her any more.\nKATHY: She might. She knows stuff as well.\nJAMES: Oh, all right. Send what’s left of your brother. He’s doing sod-all right now.\nKATHY: He can't leave this room. He’s not strong enough yet. I'll go.\nJAMES: Well, go then! I’m staying here. Come on, Doctor. Tell us everything.\nMICHAEL: (crying) Tegan.\nKATHY: Stand back. Let me... where’s she gone?\nTEGAN: Behind you. (thump, thump) I don’t want to hurt you, but... come on, back to the control room. It really is just like the old days.\nTEGAN: Right, James. Oh, where’s he gone?\nKATHY: I don’t, I don’t know.\nMICHAEL: He’s left you. It’s just us now.\nKATHY: He’s taken a copy, a back-up of everything.\nTEGAN: You know what? I don’t care. Just free the Doctor.\nKATHY: I can’t. It’s the only way to save Nate.\nTEGAN: Right, you, Nate creature thing. Whatever. Free the Doctor or we kill your sister.\nMICHAEL: Blimey, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Needs must. Nate, I Know you're in there. Your sister, lovely, lovely Kath Chambers here, you want her to die?\nMICHAEL: He’s going to the controls.\nKATHY: No, Nate.\nTEGAN: That's it, let the Doctor out of there.\nDOCTOR: Argh. 8687. 8687.\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Are you okay?\nDOCTOR: I will be. Thanks for saving my life.\nTEGAN: That’s what I’m here for. Now, Nate, shut down the System. Shut it all down.\nKATHY: No!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It all has to stop, Doctor Chambers. You have to let go. Tegan, let her go.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: She can’t see this.\nKATHY: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Nathaniel. Nathaniel Chambers, can you hear me? You don’t belong here. You should have died many years ago.\nKATHY: Stop it.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Doctor Chambers, but this ends now.\nKATHY: No!\nDOCTOR: Don’t you understand? I’ve seen it before. You start off by just wanting to cure one person, but then you realise you can really make them better, make them stronger, fitter. And not just one person. You can do it to everyone. You can improve humanity and... I’m sorry for what I said earlier, Michael. I happen to like humanity as it is.\nTEGAN: Kath, you saw what happened to your father. You saw the monster he became. If you do this thing\nKATHY: I’ve got to do this. I’ve gotta save Nate.\nDOCTOR: You can’t. He’s gone. It won’t be him any more. I was there when it happened before. I watched a world change. I won't let it happen again. If you make the choice to do this, it will be your last one. There'll be no more choices, no more free will. The world will just be one big logical machine. Your System.\nTEGAN: And I’m sorry, Kath, but it isn’t really your choice to make.\nKATHY: What do you mean?\nTEGAN: Nathaniel? Nate? There must be part of you still in there. You must remember who you were. What do you want? You saw your father. Is that what you want? And it won’t just be you. It'll happen to everyone. We'll all become like him.\nDOCTOR: Nathaniel. Nathaniel, while you exist like this, your sister is... This is her life. You’re holding her back. Let her go.\nMICHAEL: What is he doing?\nSYSTEM: Self-destruct sequence initiated.\nDOCTOR: Right, everyone, out.\nKATHY: No!\nDOCTOR: Everyone! That includes you, Doctor Chambers. Now run!\nDOCTOR: CYBER-NATE: Kath.\nDOCTOR: Get away as far as\nDOCTOR: Everyone okay?\nTEGAN: + MICHAEL: Yeah, fine.\nDOCTOR: Doctor Chambers?\nKATHY: It’s over. It’s all over.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMICHAEL: I'll call the police.\nDOCTOR: I really don’t think that’s necessary.\nMICHAEL: She killed people.\nDOCTOR: She needs help. She’s been through so much. I can take her somewhere.\nTEGAN: It wasn’t your fault.\nDOCTOR: You don’t know that. And I still don’t know what I do in the future, in her past. Why I apparently don’t remember knowing her after I regenerate.\nTEGAN: Something for you to investigate, then.\nDOCTOR: I imagine so. Now then, why don’t you two go home, get some sleep, and I'll see you in the morning.\nROSEMARY: [OC]: Good morning. It’s just coming up to eight o’clock. I’m Rosemary Stark. Well, Brisbane, that was some night, wasn’t it? Police have confirmed that the breakdown of the city’s telephone and satellite systems was due to a minor technical fault, and everything else should be up and running within the hour. In other news, an explosion at Chambers Pharmaceuticals has been blamed on a gas leak. Two women died in the explosion. One is believed to have been the company’s founder, Doctor Katherine Chambers. The other’s identity has not yet been revealed. Police spokesman Eric Stieger highlighted that the two incidents were unconnected, and that were not the result of a terrorist attack. It seems we have nothing to...\nTEGAN: Shh. Shh.\nMICHAEL: (yawns) Morning.\nTEGAN: Hi. Sleep well?\nMICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah, I did. You?\nTEGAN: Mmm.\nMICHAEL: So, what happens... What the hell is that?\nTEGAN: It’s something I didn’t think I'd hear again.\nMICHAEL: The Doctor?\nTEGAN: Yeah.\nMICHAEL: His time machine! This I have to see.\nTEGAN: Actually, would you mind... would you mind staying here? I wanna say goodbye to him properly\nMICHAEL: Yeah, okay.\nTEGAN: Morning!\nDOCTOR: You look cheerful. You okay?\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: Since when were you a morning person?\nTEGAN: Ha, ha. How’s Kath?\nDOCTOR: She'll be... well, she’ll be looked after. I’ve spoken to the police. They think she died in the explosion. Her and poor Jodi. And they're looking for James Clarke.\nTEGAN: No idea where he’s gone?\nDOCTOR: No, and he’s got a copy of System which I really should try and... It doesn’t matter. What about you?\nTEGAN: What about me?\nDOCTOR: You're dying.\nTEGAN: Yeah?\nDOCTOR: Come with me. Let me help you.\nTEGAN: No.\nDOCTOR: Please, Tegan.\nTEGAN: No, Doctor. I’m happy. I don’t know how long I've got left, but I’m happy. I’m with Michael.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, Michael. He said something about er\nTEGAN: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s a bit embarrassing.\nTEGAN: Try me.\nDOCTOR: Well, he thought you... you might be bitter with me because, well, you know...\nTEGAN: No, Doctor, I don’t know. Know what?\nDOCTOR: That you were, or are or were, anyway I er, well, in love with me.\nTEGAN: (laughs) Oh, get real. I mean, you’re a great guy, Doctor. Well, most of the time. Especially when I’m in Brisbane and you're on Planet Zarg or whatever. But love you? Sometimes Michael can be so sweet. Dim, and like all men, sees things in black and white. But no, Doctor, I’m not in love with you. Not now, not then, not ever.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh, er, good. Because that would be\nTEGAN: As far from possible as it can get. Honestly, Doctor, I’m fine. Fine as I can be. I mean, look. I’ve got a career, a life, even a stunning apartment. Who knows, maybe some doctor here will be able to help. But really, no more aliens.\nDOCTOR: But I might know someone who could help you. Please reconsider.\nTEGAN: No. Anyway, you’ve got new friends now. Friends who need you. More than I do, I imagine. What are they called? Peri and\nDOCTOR: Erimem.\nTEGAN: Right. So, how are they gonna feel if I turn up?\nDOCTOR: I can’t imagine.\nTEGAN: Look, I Know I sounded a bit harsh yesterday, but it was my birthday. I don’t really like birthdays.\nDOCTOR: Why am I not surprised?\nTEGAN: But I’ve got to tell you, I don’t for a minute regret leaving you. It was great. You, me, the others, what we saw, what we did. But I have been happy being home. I’ve not been holding my breath waiting for you to come back, because in some ways you never really left me. You changed me. For the better, I think. But I mean it. Thanks to you, I’ve enjoyed every last minute of my life - every piece of toast, every endless meeting - you made me realise just how lucky I am not to be, well, you know, dead, or a slave or whatever. Because of you I appreciate... oh gawd, don’t take the mick... I’ve learnt to appreciate just well, I’m trying not to use the word magic. (the Doctor laughs) Oi. I’m trying to be serious.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, I’m sorry. No, no, I’m sorry. It’s okay. I Know what you mean.\nTEGAN: Good. Now go on, back in your box.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, I don’t want to leave you.\nTEGAN: You’re not. I’m leaving you. Again. Come here. (kiss) Don’t look like that, Doctor. Thanks to you I’ve seen and done... I’ve lived more than anyone else. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: No, thank you.\nTEGAN: And hey, remember what you always told me. Brave heart. You'll survive.\nTEGAN: Goodbye, Doctor."
