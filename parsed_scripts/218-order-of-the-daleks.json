A great deal of trouble indeed...\nDOCTOR: Is that so? May I ask who you are, ‘sir’, and what exactly it is we’re supposed to have done?\nPENDLE: Are you aware of the name of this planet, sir?\nDOCTOR: (STARTING TO BRISTLE NOW) Yes, ‘sir’, I am very well aware of its name. The planet Strellin is renowned throughout the galaxy for its peaceful tranquillity, and if it is to retain that noble reputation will you please stop prevaricating and tell us who you are!\nPENDLE: (ALSO BRISTLING) Prevaricating? Prevaricating?! I’ve never been [ So... ]\nASTA: (INTERRUPTING TO KEEP THE PEACE) Doctor, this is planetary assessor Malcolm Pendle, of the Central Galactic Census Bureau. I’m junior assessor Jane Asta.\nPENDLE: Probationary assessor. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, shall we, Ms Asta?\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 9\nASTA: No, Assessor. (CONFIDENTIALLY) It’s my first time out in the field.\nDOCTOR: Well it’s always good to get your hands dirty. (BEAT) Galactic Census, eh?\nPENDLE: (PROUDLY) Indeed. You and your associate have just made planetfall on a grade three world without taking the proper precautions. Your appearance could do untold harm to the inhabitants.\nCONSTANCE: But we’ve not seen any inhabitants. We’re in the middle of nowhere!\nDOCTOR: Allow me to reassure you. I am something of an expert when it comes to visiting pre-space age civilisations. (PROUDLY) I ama Time Lord.\nPENDLE: A Time Lord, hm?\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nPENDLE: Then you should know better! Swanning around space and time as if you own it all. The arrogance of you people amazes me.\nDOCTOR: Arrogant? Me?\nPENDLE: You won’t get away with this, you know. (PATTING SATCHEL) Now — where are my penalty fine notifications?\nDOCTOR: What are you going to do? Stick a ticket on my TARDIS? Well, let me tell you—\nCONSTANCE: (INTERRUPTING) Stop it, both of you!\nCONSTANCE: AN ABRUPT SILENCE.\nCONSTANCE: That’s better. Will someone please tell me what a ‘grade three planet’ is, and why it is such a problem that we’re on one?\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 10\nPENDLE: You pretend not to know...?\nASTA: A grade three planet is one that has no significant technology, no knowledge of other worlds, and as such, has a protected status.\nCONSTANCE: A mediaeval society, you’re saying.\nASTA: Er, yes. Landings by offworlders are strictly prohibited.\nDOCTOR: Which rather brings us to the question of what you two are doing here, hmm?\nASTA: We're, well —\nPENDLE: (INTERRUPTING) We are here on a mission of an extremely sensitive nature.\nDOCTOR: Why? What have you found?\nDOCTOR: Come on man, I might be able to help!\nASTA: We've picked up a signal, you see —\nPENDLE: (WARNING) Asta...\nASTA: But surely they could be of assistance, Assessor...\nDOCTOR: (INTRIGUED NOW) A signal? From here?\nCONSTANCE: What kind of a signal? A distress call of some kind?\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 11\nPENDLE: The type of signal is academic! It’s the fact that it originates here at all!\nDOCTOR: It was definitely artificially generated? Not a natural occurrence?\nPENDLE: We’d hardly be wasting our time here if that were remotely possible.\nCONSTANCE: Why didn’t we pick up this signal in the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) I’m not sure..\nPENDLE: (DISMISSIVELY) Well, your equipment hardly looks state of the art...\nDOCTOR: Appearances can be deceptive. Still, it’s worth checking. Hold this Box Brownie for me, would you?\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR DUMPS THE CAMERA INTO HIS HANDS.\nPENDLE: But — this is a camera! I shall have to confiscate this!\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING THROUGH POCKETS) Now somewhere in this pocket I should have... A-ha! (HE PULLS OUT A SCANNER)\nPENDLE: A portable scanner?! — This irresponsible brandishing of anachronistic technology must stop!\nDOCTOR: Just be quiet for a moment, there’s a good chap. Now then...\nDOCTOR: HE TUNES THE CONTROLS.

We mustn’t let them see us. — If you hadn’t heard the noise that blue box of\nROSCO: theirs made... (A BEAT — AS HE ‘HEARS’ GABBER’S UNSPOKEN QUESTION) No, I’ve never seen anything like it before, either.\nCROSS BACK TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 13\nCROSS BACK TO: A REGULAR, RHYTHMIC BEEPING ISSUES FROM THE SPEAKER.\nASTA: That’s the signal!\nDOCTOR: Yes.. Well, there’s nothing natural about that. A subspace Signal, operating on a very narrow bandwidth.\nCONSTANCE: Listen. It’s a repeating cycle. Like an SOS?\nASTA: Any possibility that the inhabitants might have finally achieved grade two status has to be investigated.\nDOCTOR: I find it highly unlikely that this is something generated by the locals.\nASTA: I agree. And if it’s not come from them, then...\nPENDLE: (INTERRUPTING) Yes, well, that is why we are here. To investigate, not speculate. So if you will kindly unburden me of this ‘Box Brownie’\nPENDLE: HE DUMPS IT BACK INTO THE DOCTOR’S HANDS.\nPENDLE: . There. Come along, Asta, we’ve wasted quite enough time here.\nCONSTANCE: So you know where the signal is coming from?\nASTA: Yes, from the monastery in the valley.\nDOCTOR: Excellent! That’s where we were heading, anyway. We’1ll come with you.\nPENDLE: Out of the question! Contact with such a reclusive order is a delicate matter, requiring years of training.\nDOCTOR: (FAWNING) Then we’ll be able to watch a master of the technique at work.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 14\nPENDLE: Well, I suppose if you stay out of the way...\nDOCTOR: But of course. You’1ll barely notice us.\nPENDLE: Very well. But your... associate should cover herself up. The monks are very impressionable. Not sure how they’d react to an overt display of femininity.\nCONSTANCE: I hardly think my outfit’s likely to start a riot!\nDOCTOR: No, but Mr Pendle may have a point. I daresay the monks are rather naive. There’s a cloak in the TARDIS — perhaps you could...?\nCONSTANCE: A cloak? — Oh, alright, then. But only because the breeze is a shade autumnal.\nCONSTANCE: EXITS INTO TARDIS. CROSS TO:\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 15\nCONSTANCE: THE GROUP AROUND THE TARDIS, HEARD FROM A DISTANCE.\nASTA: (OFF) Thank you, Doctor. So many regulations have been broken already.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Not at all.\nPENDLE: (OFF) How long’s she going to be? I don’t think we should wait.\nROSCO: (SOTTO; TO GABBER) Demons? You really think...? The one in the colours looks very strange, you’re right.\nOFF: — TARDIS DOOR OPENS AGAIN.\nCONSTANCE: (OFF) Better?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Splendid. — I trust that hood covers Mrs Clarke’s lovely features sufficiently, Pendle?\nPENDLE: (OFF) Yes, yes, yes. Now, come along. I’ve no intention of being out on this moor after dark.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Then please, lay on!\nDOCTOR: THEY SET OFF ACROSS THE MOORLAND, FOOSTEPS FADING. A RUSTLE AS\nROSCO: GETS TO HIS FEET.\nROSCO: All right, Gabber. They’ve gone now.\nRUSTLING: AS GABBER RISES FROM GRASSES.\nROSCO: We must warn Master Boswyck about these demons. And if we take\nROSCO: the old Brandelak trail.. we can beat them to the monastery.\nROSCO: THE TWO BOYS HURRY AWAY.\nROSCO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 16\nROSCO: FADE UP. DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE WALKING BRISKLY BEHIND PENDLE AND ASTA.\nCONSTANCE: So what do you think’s going on here, Doctor? Do you suppose that signal came from someone else who’s landed on this planet?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. I only hope your ‘big game’ theory turns out to be incorrect. (MUSING) That said.. there was something oddly familiar about the pattern of that signal, if I could only put my finger on it...\nPENDLE: (CALLING BACK FROM A LITTLE WAY AHEAD) Come along, you two. Don’t dawdle. Our destination is in sight!\nCONSTANCE: The monastery?\nDOCTOR: Just over this rise, I suspect.. Ah, and there it is!\nCONSTANCE: Goodness. It’s more like a palace!\nDOCTOR: That’s why I was so keen to see it. A wonder of timber, masonry and stained glass, crafted by— (BREAKS OFF SUDDENLY; A GASP OF\nDISCOMFORT: AS SOMETHING PIERCES HIS MIND) Ah!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? Are you all right?\nPENDLE: (COMING OVER) Are you in pain, man?\nDOCTOR: (RECOVERING) No, no, I’m fine. Just a mental twinge, that’s all.\nCONSTANCE: A mental twinge?\nDOCTOR: A momentary telepathic contact, perhaps...?\nASTA: Telepathy? With someone here?\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m only speculating.\nPENDLE: What rubbish. Come along, Asta. We’re nearly at the gates.\nPENDLE: HE STRIDES OFF, FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS.\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 18\nDISTANT: CLANGING OF BELL — CONTINUES. ROSCO AND GABBER’S FOOTSTEPS ON FLAGSTONES OF CORRIDOR OUTSIDE, THEN A FRANTIC KNOCKING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WOODEN DOOR.\nROSCO: (OUTSIDE; BREATHLESS) Master Boswyck! Master Boswyck!\nBOSWYCK: Come.\nDOOR: CLATTERS OPEN.\nROSCO: (BREATHLESS) Master Boswyck, [I-—]\nBOSWYCK: Rosco and Gabber. Why is it that whenever there is noise and commotion, you two are always the source of it?\nROSCO: Master Boswyck — we are beset by demons!\nBOSWYCK: (SCEPTICAL) Demons, Rosco?\nROSCO: My brother and I were on the moor. There was a terrible noise, then we saw a box had apparated there, bringing two oddly- dressed demons to our lands!\nBOSWYCK: Two, you say? A veritable horde.\nROSCO: They were then joined by two more.\nBOSWYCK: Also demons?\nROSCO: No, they were in plain robes. Their acolytes, perhaps! The box in which they arrived still stands on the moor. We must tell the Abbot. The demons must be banished before they destroy us all!\nBOSWYCK: Let’s not get over-excited, shall we, Rosco? [I accept that you\nBOSWYCK: may have seen something unusual...]\nBOSWYCK: MEANWHILE, RASPAK HAS BEEN HURRYING ALONG CORRIDOR OUTSIDE.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 19\nRASPAK: (ARRIVING) Master Boswyck, have you seen — (SEES ROSCO AND GABBER) Rosco and Gabber. There you are. Why did you ignore the alarum?\nROSCO: A-alarum, sir?\nRASPAK: The bell, idiot boy!\nBOSWYCK: Raspak — the bell always sounds this time of an evening.\nRASPAK: This isn’t a call to drill, Boswyck. Four strangers approach the gates. I need all the novices to ready arms.\nROSCO: (WHISPERING) The demons!\nRASPAK: What was that, boy?\nBOSWYCK: Oh, pay him no heed. The boy has been suffering from troubled sleep. I was merely preparing a herbal remedy for him.\nRASPAK: Well, make it quick — the strangers will be here any moment, and I need these two outside.\nRASPAK: HE LEAVES, SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.\nROSCO: We must warn them, Master Boswyck. The demons...\nBOSWYCK: Strangers, Rosco, strangers. Let’s find out a little bit more about them before we label them denizens of hell and condemn them to the flames, hm?\nROSCO: But...\nBOSWYCK: (STERNLY) I’ve spared you Raspak’s wrath. Now we’ll have no more talk of apparating demons and acolytes — you understand?\nROSCO: Yes, Master Boswyck.\nROSCO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 20\nBOSWYCK: Gabber, too. Not that you’1ll be telling anyone anything, I suppose, Since you adopted this ‘vow of silence’. But nonetheless...? (BEAT WHILE GABBER NODS) Good. Run along now and join the other novices. I shall take the information you have given me to the Abbot.\nROSCO: Yes, Master Boswyck.\nROSCO: THE TWO BOYS HURRY OUT.\nROSCO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 21\nDISTANT: BELL CONTINUES AS DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, PENDLE AND ASTA ARRIVE AT THE MONASTERY GATES.\nCONSTANCE: Imposing gates, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: A symphony in carved flowers. As I said, the Brotherhood are\nDOCTOR: master craftsmen.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, but gates this size usually mean one thing:\nDOCTOR: They do?\nASTA: “Keep out.”\nCONSTANCE: So how do we get in — knock?\nPENDLE: You will do no such thing. Asta — please relate the first principle of first contact?\nASTA: “We must make our presence known in a non-aggressive way.”\nPENDLE: Now, [watch as I attempt to do just that...]\nOVER THIS: CLATTER OF BOLTS BEING DRAWN...\nCONSTANCE: I don’t think that will be necessary.\nCONSTANCE: . AND THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY BEGIN TO OPEN.\nASTA: The gates are opening!\nPENDLE: Now then. Leave all the talking to me. These are simple people...\nRASPAK: (OFF) There they are. Present arms!\nA DOZEN NOVICES: (PRESENT ARMS WITH A NOISY HAKA-LIKE CRY) Ha!!!\nA DOZEN NOVICES: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 22\nCONSTANCE: Simple people with staffs and spears...\nPENDLE: (STEPPING FORWARD) Greetings, gentle brothers, we are merchants...\nRASPAK: (OFF) Seize them!\nA DOZEN NOVICES: (CHARGE FORWARD, OVERWHELMING THE GROUP) Raaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!\nNOVICES: CHARGE FORWARD. SCUFFLING.\nPENDLE: (GRABBED) Now really, there is no need for this aggression!\nASTA: (GRABBED) Ah!\nCONSTANCE: (GRABBED) Do you mind!\nRASPAK: Cease! (STEPPING FORWARD) Speak! — why have you come?\nPENDLE: My c-colleague and I are humble merchants, nothing more.\nRASPAK: Then why do the two in the cloaks hide their faces with hoods?\nPENDLE: EY...\nCONSTANCE: (LOWERING HOOD) As you see, we’ve nothing to hide.\nDOCTOR: (HASTILY) These two... er, boys, are our apprentices. I assure you, they’re quite harmless!\nRASPAK: That’s for the Abbot to decide. (TO HIS MEN) You men: lock these... apprentice boys in one of the cells. —\nRASPAK: ASTA AND CONSTANCE ARE BUNDLED AWAY.\nRASPAK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 23\nCONSTANCE: (AS SHE’S BUNDLED AWAY) You’ve seized us already, there’s no\nCONSTANCE: need to drag us —\nRASPAK: You others: these so-called ‘merchants’ are coming with me!\nRASPAK: DOCTOR AND PENDLE ARE DRAGGED OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.\nPENDLE: (DRAGGED) Oh, mercy!\nDOCTOR: It is so enlightening watching a master of first contact at work.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: FADE UP GENTLE TINKLING OF WINDCHIMES IN THE BACKGROUND.\nOVERALL: CALM ATMOS. SCUFFLING FROM OFF AS 4 x NOVICES DRAG THE DOCTOR AND PENDLE IN.\nPENDLE: (OFF) Oh, do be careful...\nDOCTOR: (OFF) There really is no need to manhandle us like this...\nRASPAK: Halt!\nALL: STOP — SCUFFLING CEASES.\nTANAPAL: Raspak? What is this noise?\nRASPAK: I apologise for disturbing the peace of your chamber, holy one, but these are the strangers.\nTANAPAL: Guards — release your grip.\nTANAPAL: DOCTOR AND PENDLE RELAX.\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING FORWARD) My thanks. May I ask whom we are addressing?\nTANAPAL: I am Tanapal. Abbot of the Brotherhood of the Black Petal.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, your holiness — but I’m at a loss to understand why Brother Raspak here greets strangers not with kindness, but with spears and staves.\nBOSWYCK: (STEPPING FORWARD) It is Brother Raspak’s duty to ensure our monastery’s security. On this occasion, it seems he may have exceeded himself.\nRASPAK: (BRISTLING) It is not I who exceeds himself... Herbalist! Sticking your nose in where it’s not wanted, as usual —\nRASPAK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 25\nTANAPAL: (FIRM — NOT ANGRY) Silence, brothers.\nTANAPAL: Strangers are rare in this region. Tell me: where did you come from?\nDOCTOR: Well, your [holiness—]\nPENDLE: (INTERRUPTING) As I have tried to explain, your eminence, my colleague and I are merchants, come from the cities of the East in search of new markets to sell our wares.\nTANAPAL: Unaccompanied?\nRASPAK: They came with two ‘apprentice boys’, your holiness. I had them locked up.\nBOSWYCK: Nonetheless... the few merchants we have met before brought with them pack animals, and had sherpas to guide them through the perilous mountain paths. (FISHING) Did you not leave a caravan, perhaps, somewhere on the moor?\nDOCTOR: (AWARE OF WHAT BOSWYCK IS DOING) Or perhaps we’re just travelling light.\nTANAPAL: But you were fortunate to find our monastery, without the help of local guides.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well—\nPENDLE: (BUTTING IN) Kindly leave the talking to me. — As a matter of fact, your holiness, we were guided here. But not by sherpas.\nTANAPAL: Then how?\nDOCTOR: Do stop pussyfooting around, Pendle. — Abbot Tanapal: I don’t Suppose you know of any signal being sent from this monastery?\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 26\nTANAPAL: (SUDDENLY HARD — THE WORD’S HAD AN ELECTRIC EFFECT) Signal? What do you mean by ‘signal’? (BARKED) Speak!!!\nPENDLE: (TERRIFIED) Summoned! We were summoned!\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Pendle...! (TO ABBOT) Yes, we were summoned, in the manner of speaking. By — how to put it? By a strange reverberation in the ether!\nBOSWYCK: (SMOOTHLY) Ah, I see it now. Your holiness — I believe that what these merchants are trying to tell us is that they were led here by the tolling of the tower bell, used to call the faithful to prayer.\nPENDLE: (RELIEVED) The bell! Yes, yes, that was it! Exactly!\nRASPAK: (DUHH!) The tolling of our bell couldn’t be heard in the cities of the east!\nBOSWYCK: But the sound carries through the mountain passes, does it not? Indeed, I believe it to be amplified there.\nDOCTOR: That, Master Boswyck, I believe to be a sound observation. (TO TANAPAL) Your holiness — night draws on. Please, might we prevail on your hospitality, just for one evening?\nTANAPAL: (DECISIVELY) Raspak, have these merchants join their apprentices in the secure quarters.\nDOCTOR: ‘Secure quarters’?\nTANAPAL: A cell is the only accommodation we have, even for honoured guests. (CLAPS HANDS) Take them away!\nNOVICES: LEAD DOCTOR AND PENDLE OUT.\nPENDLE: (LED AWAY) This is all wrong. We’re only merchants...\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 27\nBOSWYCK: (TO TANAPAL) Perhaps if I might return to my duties, your holiness...?\nTANAPAL: Of course.\nRASPAK: Begone, Boswyck.\nBOSWYCK: EXITS QUICKLY, CLOSING LARGE WOODEN DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A HEFTY THUD. BEAT. ALONE WITH RASPAK, TANAPAL’S VOICE\nBECOMES: ANGRY AND URGENT.\nTANAPAL: These people are not merchants, Raspak.\nRASPAK: No, master.\nTANAPAL: They have heard our signal. They are visitors from beyond this world.\nRASPAK: Yes, master.\nTANAPAL: They cannot have landed in the mountains. Search the moors. Find the vessel they arrived in. Find it, and bring it here!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 28\nTANAPAL: CLATTER OF A KEY IN AN OLD LOCK. WOODEN DOOR CREAKS OPEN.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor! Thank goodness.\nASTA: Assessor Pendle — are you all right?\nDOCTOR: Thank you, guards. There’s no need to point the way with spears.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR AND PENDLE TROOP IN. DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKED BEHIND.\nASTA: You’ve not been harmed, then — either of you?\nPENDLE: No thanks to the Doctor. Complicating matters with his talk of ‘signals’!\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find that matters are already far more complicated than any of us would like, Mr Pendle.\nCONSTANCE: Why? What did the Abbot say to you?\nDOCTOR: It was more what that he didn’t say. But he knows something about the subspace signal, that’s for certain. The guard captain Raspak, too. And I’m still bothered by that telepathic contact I experienced, on the moor...\nCONSTANCE: Your ‘mental twinge’, you mean?\nCROSS TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 29\nCROSS TO: PRISONERS’ VOICES JUST AUDIBLE THROUGH DOOR AS BOSWYCK WALKS UP TO THE GUARD OUTSIDE — HABRILD.\nPENDLE: (OFF) Pseudo-mystic fiddle-faddle!\nDOCTOR: (OFF; LOUDLY) Trust me, Mr Pendle. My instincts in these matters are rarely wrong.\nPENDLE: (OFF; SCOFFING) Faugh!!!\nCONSTANCE: (OFF) What was it, Doctor? This ‘twinge’?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) I’m convinced I felt a presence, Mrs Clarke. A living mental contact!\nASTA: (OFF) Ssh, someone’s outside!\nFOOTSTEPS: STOP OUTSIDE CELL.\nHABRILD: Can I help you, Master Boswyck?\nBOSWYCK: Guard Habrild. There is no need for you to stand sentry here.\nHABRILD: But, Brother Raspak said...\nBOSWYCK: I am Brother Raspak’s senior, and I would have you assist Allget the Unsteady in the kitchens.\nHABRILD: (UNSURE) I —\nBOSWYCK: Or would you rather clean out the garderobes? Now: give me the\nBOSWYCK: keys. I shall be responsible for our guests.\nHABRILD: Yes, Master Boswyck.\nHANDS: OVER JANGLING KEYS, THEN EXITS DOWN CORRIDOR. CROSS TO:\nHANDS: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 30\nHANDS: CLATTER OF KEY IN LOCK. WOODEN DOOR CREAKS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Master Boswyck, isn’t it? The herbalist.\nBOSWYCK: I could not help but overhear what you were saying... ‘Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Nasty habit, eavesdropping.\nBOSWYCK: But enlightening. You say that you sensed a ‘presence’? In the monastery?\nDOCTOR: Around it, certainly.\nCONSTANCE: Master Boswyck. Are we really the only strangers who’ve come here recently?\nBOSWYCK: (AMUSED — HE KNOWS) Ah. One of the ‘boy apprentices’.\nASTA: Look, we're not boys.\nPENDLE: Asta, please, your disguise...\nASTA: It doesn’t matter any more. It’s far more important that we get to the bottom of all this, and quickly.\nBOSWYCK: Nonetheless, you should proceed discreetly. Some of the novices won’t ever have set eyes on a woman before.\nCONSTANCE: Please, Master Boswyck. I asked you a question.\nBOSWYCK: At the end of the last harvest, during the height of the autumn storms, a star was spotted in the southern sky. But as it drew closer, it became clear that this was no natural phenomenon.\nDOCTOR: A spacecraft.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 31\nBOSWYCK: Indeed. It crashed in the fields to the east. The fireball lit up the sky for miles.\nASTA: (PLEASED WITH HERSELF) I knew that signal had to be of off- world origin.\nBOSWYCK: Our order is sworn to protect the sanctity of all life — even if that life is not of our world — so we ventured out to see what could be done to help.\nDOCTOR: There were survivors, weren’t there?\nBOSWYCK: Many had died, but yes, some had survived the crash. We brought them and the remains of their vessel back to the monastery. We nursed them back to health as best we could, though these were beings unlike anything we had ever encountered...\nPENDLE: (GROANS) Oh, no. Oh no, no, no. A grade three planet exposed to grade one technology. Do you have any idea how much paperwork there’1ll be?\nASTA: So the signal we heard, that came from the crashed ship?\nBOSWYCK: The creatures tried to show us how to repair their machinery, but their craft was badly damaged. Their, er, t-t-t.. (SEARCHES FOR THE WORD)\nCONSTANCE: Transmitter?\nBOSWYCK: That’s right. Their transmitter is within the walls, but the Signal it produces is very weak.\nPENDLE: And the creatures themselves? They’re still here?\nBOSWYCK: They stay near the remains of their craft. They work night and day, aided by the Abbot’s personal guard. But they work in secret. The few assisting them have sworn never to speak of what they see or do.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 32\nPENDLE: But this is appalling! To show such contempt of accepted protocol, to involve the populace in such a manner! We shall need forms, Asta, lots and lots of forms.\nDOCTOR: The occupants of that craft crashed, Pendle! I’m sure they’ve been thinking only of their own survival...\nBOSWYCK: (SIGHS) Ah, if only that were true. Sadly these creatures have more than just survival on their minds...\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nBOSWYCK: I believe that the Abbot is under the influence of these creatures, that they are controlling him for some malign purpose. — Doctor, you said that you sensed a presence. I have been praying for help to come to our monastery. Perhaps my prayers have been answered...\nDOCTOR: (SCEPTICAL) I’d not go that far, Master Boswyck. But I think you'd better take us to these troublesome visitors of yours, don’t you?\nBOSWYCK: Follow me.\nALL EXIT INTO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 33\nALL EXIT INTO: AS BOSWYCK LEADS THE DOCTOR AND THE OTHERS OUTSIDE...\nBOSWYCK: The creatures confine themselves to the East Range.\nROSCO: (RUNNING UP) Master Boswyck! Master Boswyck!\nBOSWYCK: Rosco. What is it now?\nROSCO: I had to find you. Raspak has taken guards to fetch the strangers’ caravan, and bring it back to the monastery!\nBOSWYCK: (ANGRY) I thought I told you to say nothing...\nROSCO: (INTERRUPTING) Not the box. A strange shiny caravan. Two of the Brothers returning from the Black Valley reported seeing it on the moor!\nASTA: Oh no...\nPENDLE: Our shuttle. This is terrible news. Terrible!\nCONSTANCE: I’m sure it’s not as bad as all that.\nPENDLE: Not that bad! Do you have any idea of the cultural pollution it might cause?\nASTA: He’s right. The shuttle is packed with anachronisms. Communications devices, star maps, a food synthesisev...\nDOCTOR: But only if the monks gain entry to your ship. I can’t believe you were foolish enough to leave it unlocked?\nPENDLE: Of course not!\nCONSTANCE: Well then. Surely the damage will be limited.\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 34\nASTA: But it’s our responsibility. We have to ensure that the ship is secure. Ideally remove it from the scene.\nPENDLE: Well, then, Asta — you’1ll have to go. Take this Mrs Clarke with you, if you must.\nASTA: You forget, sir: I’m not a qualified pilot.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Right, I’ll go. You three stay here, I’1ll be as quick as I can.\nPENDLE: Out of the question! I can’t allow you to wander around a grade three planet unsupervised!\nASTA: Well the solution is obvious then, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: It is?\nASTA: There are two of us and two of you. You and Assessor Pendle secure and remove the shuttle, while I investigate the aliens with Mrs Clarke.\nPENDLE: Probationary Assessor Asta, if you really [think—]\nASTA: (INTERUPTING) Probationary Assessor, exactly. Such a mission would be the ideal way for you to assess my suitability to become a full Assessor. That, after all, is the point of my being here.\nPENDLE: Well, yes, I suppose. But you will observe these aliens only. Make unsupervised contact and I shall be obliged to fail you!\nASTA: Fine by me.\nCONSTANCE: Well, that seems to have settled that.\nBOSWYCK: Rosco, will you show the Doctor and this man Pendle how they may access the moor without passing through the main gate?\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 35\nROSCO: (NERVOUS) Me, Master Boswyck? Consort with demons?\nBOSWYCK: As I’ve already explained to you, Rosco, these people are strangers, nothing more. You have nothing to fear from them.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. My bark is worse than my bite, I assure you. And Pendle here’s a pussycat really — aren’t you, Pendle?\nROSCO: (THINKS) Alright, then. This way.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Mrs Clarke — although I have absolute faith in your abilities, I presume you’re happy with this arrangement?\nCONSTANCE: Perfectly happy. Observation only, then we’ll retire.\nDOCTOR: As soon as the shuttle’s secure, we’ll come and find you.\nPENDLE: Doctor, if you’re quite finished...?\nCONSTANCE: Good luck.\nDOCTOR: Right, young man. Lead on.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR, PENDLE AND ROSCO HEAD OFF - LEFT.\nCONSTANCE: The East Range, you said, Master Boswyck?\nBOSWYCK: If anyone should challenge us, let me do the talking. This way.\nBOSWYCK: CONSTANCE, ASTA AND BOSWYCK HEAD OFF — RIGHT. FADE.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 36\nBOSWYCK: FADE UP. FAINT ‘ORGANIC HEARTBEAT’ FROM OFF. BOSWYCK, CONSTANCE AND ASTA RUN UP.\nBOSWYCK: The aliens’ chamber is through here. Usually it’s guarded, but doubtless Raspak has got all the bodies he can out collecting this ‘caravan’.\nASTA: (SNIFFING THE AIR) What is that awful smell?\nCONSTANCE: Meat. It’s like a butcher’s market.\nBOSWYCK: Hoods up, perhaps? — Now, quietly!\nBOSWYCK: JANGLE OF KEYS. KEY IN LOCK.

BOSWYCK\nCLOSES: DOOR. SLIGHTLY HUSHED VOICES.\nBOSWYCK: Observe, yonder. That is how the injured creatures have been kept alive.\nASTA: What? In bags, hanging from the rafters?\nCONSTANCE: They’re not bags. That smell, it’s obvious! They’re stomachs.\nBOSWYCK: You are quite correct. They are stomachs cut from two Brandelak, repurposed as wombs for the creatures to rest in.\nASTA: That’s horrible!\nCONSTANCE: MOVES FORWARD.\nCONSTANCE: Like the Doctor said, it’s survival. The best they could do in the circumstances...\nASTA: Constance. Don’t get too close.\nCONSTANCE: You can actually see one of the creatures moving about, through the wall of the stomach. Look, it’s turning over and around.\nASTA: It’s my stomach that’s turning over and around.\nBOSWYCK: Strange — someone’s knocked a hole in the far wall, to connect this chamber to the next.\nCONSTANCE: So.. what are you saying?\nBOSWYCK: There may be someone through there. Back into the corridor, hurry!\nSUDDENLY: — A DALEK GLIDES INTO THE CHAMBER FROM OFF.\nSUDDENLY: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL)\nDALEK: #1: Halt! Do not move!\nCONSTANCE: Too late.

What’s wrong?\nASTA: These aliens... they’re Daleks!\nDALEK: #1: You are my prisoners!!!\nCONSTANCE: What in heaven’s name is it, this ‘Dalek’?\nDALEK: #1: Do not move! — Obey! Obey!!!\nASTA: (ANXIOUS) Constance. Don’t move.\nCONSTANCE: You really are terrified, aren’t you? Boswyck too.\nBOSWYCK: (SOTTO, CALM) Of course we are.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 40\nASTA: It’s a Dalek! A vicious killing machine! How can you not know what it is?\nCONSTANCE: I thought it was something made by the monks. I’ve never seen stained glass and leadwork used in such a manner before. It’s like a mobile work of art.\nASTA: The monks must have built it a new casing.\nCONSTANCE: It’s rather beautiful. (TO DALEK) May I take a closer look?\nDALEK: #1: Stay where you are!!!\nBOSWYCK: Please do as it says, Mrs Clarke. It won’t hesitate to kill you. (TO DALEK) Master, if you would allow me to explain...?\nBOSWYCK: A SECOND DALEK ENTERS THE CHAMBER.\nCONSTANCE: Look, there’s another one.\nDALEK: #1: These humanoids are unauthorised in this sector.\nDALEK: #2: Explain...!\nBOSWYCK: These two novices are in my charge, master. New apprentices. I am training them to take care of the sleeping ones. They need to learn how to keep them healthy.\nDALEK: #1: Explanation satisfactory. You may proceed.\nDALEK: #2: No. Nutrient levels are running below optimum levels. The humanoids must fetch more.\nBOSWYCK: Yes, master. Immediately, master.

We have to find Assessor Pendle. We have to let the Census know!\nCONSTANCE: Never mind that now. What was all that about ‘nutrients’?\nBOSWYCK: (GRIM) I shall show you...\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 42\nFROM BELOW: THE SOUND OF MANY MONKS GRUNTING AND HEAVING, MINGLED WITH THE MOOING AND SNORTING OF THE BRANDELAKS, AS THE\nSHUTTLE: IS DRAGGED INTO THE COURTYARD.\nMONKS: (FROM BELOW) Heave!

Raspak’s men are bringing in the machine.\nPENDLE: My shuttle! — Doctor, what are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: For the moment, there’s nothing we can do but watch and wait.\nPENDLE: But have they managed to breach the hull?\nDOCTOR: So far as I can see it’s still intact.\nPENDLE: Then perhaps we are worrying unduly.\nRASPAK: (FROM BELOW) Cease!\nHEAVING: STOPS.\nRASPAK: (FROM BELOW) Master blacksmith! Come forward!\nPENDLE: Blacksmith...?\nDOCTOR: Beefy fellow, isn’t he?\nRASPAK: (FROM BELOW) Blacksmith — the Abbot asks you to test your tools against the hull of this vessel.\nRASPAK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: What an enormous hammer he’s got.\nROSCO: It’s used for shoeing Sleem.\nPENDLE: What are ‘Sleem’?\nRASPAK: (FROM BELOW) Everyone stand back, give him room to work!\nRASPAK: A SERIES OF COLOSSAL CLANGS AS THE BLACKSMITH SWINGS HIS HAMMER AT THE SHIP.\nDOCTOR: I hope you’ve got very comprehensive insurance, Mr Pendle, that’s going to leave quite a dent...\nPENDLE: My ship! (HE SIGHS) Still, if that’s the most sophisticated form of entry they’re going to try...\nMORE: CLANGS AS THE BLACKSMITH STRIKES THE SHIP AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nSUDDENLY: THERE IS AN ELECTRONIC ALARM NOISE.\nROSCO: Saints preserve us, what is that noise?\nDOCTOR: Oh no... He’s managed to trigger the mechanism on a fuel access panel.\nPENDLE: What are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: We must stop them, for their own safety as well as ours!\nROSCO: If you go down into the courtyard, demon, Raspak will surely kill you.\nALARM: GOES UP A PITCH.\nDOCTOR: We’ve no choice.

How can you help us?\nDOCTOR: By preventing you from doing something stupid. Hear that alarm? If Brother Schwarzenegger there were to rupture a fuel line, he could reduce this monastery to a smoke hole in the ground.\nRASPAK: You think that because we lead a simple life, that we are stupid? The ship is of no use to us if we damage its propulsion system.\nDOCTOR: Well, then!\nRASPAK: Fetch a smaller hammer, Master Blacksmith.\nALARM: STOPS.\nPENDLE: I.. I don’t understand. You shouldn’t have any knowledge of such matters.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think it’s obvious that our alien crash victims have interfered with this culture rather more directly that we had hoped. They have introduced the concept of higher technology.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 45\nRASPAK: They have passed on great knowledge!\nPENDLE: But this is outrageous!\nRASPAK: And we are fast learners.

Our hospitality was not to your liking?\nDOCTOR: When you’ve seen one cell, your holiness, you’ve seen ‘em all.\nTANAPAL: Where are your companions?\nPENDLE: At this very moment they are making a report to my superiors.\nTANAPAL: How? Your communication devices are inside your ship.\nPENDLE: I...\nTANAPAL: It does not matter. They will be caught. Now you will give me the access codes to open your ship.\nPENDLE: I most certainly will not.\nTANAPAL: Give me the codes! Your technology is all we require.\nDOCTOR: That’s what that signal’s for, isn’t it? It’s a lure. Like the Sirens of ancient mythology, you’ve been sending out a signal, hoping to lure some poor unwary traveller onto the rocks.\nTANAPAL: With the restrictions placed upon this world, no-one would answer the call. Only the proper authorities. Only... you.\nPENDLE: How can you know of such things? You’re only a primitive people...\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think that the Abbot here is far from primitive — hm?\nTANAPAL: What do you mean by — [that?] (CUT SHORT, GASPS IN PAIN) Aah!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 48\nTANAPAL: SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE DOCTOR ALSO CLUTCHES AT HIS HEAD. THE SAME ‘TWINGE’ HE FELT OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY — BUT STRONGER.\nDOCTOR: Ah!\nPENDLE: What’s wrong now?\nDOCTOR: Another contact. Another twinge, only stronger than before. — Tanapal, if there’s something you want to tell us...?\nTANAPAL: (REGAINS HIS COMPOSURE) There is nothing. (BEAT) I said your technology alone was of use to us. But we require nutrients too.\nDOCTOR: ‘Nutrients’?\nTANAPAL: The brothers donate much, but they cannot afford to be generous. You can. (CLAPS HANDS) Guards - take them to the chapel!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 49\nDOOR: CREAKS OPEN. BOSWYCK LEADS CONSTANCE AND ASTA INTO THE CHAPEL. BIG EMPTY SPACE.\nDOOR: NB: SOTTO VOICES THROUGHOUT.\nCONSTANCE: What is this? A chapel? I hardly think this is the moment for prayers. (THINKS) Then again, if these Daleks are as bad as\nCONSTANCE: Assessor Asta claims...\nASTA: They are.\nBOSWYCK: Up the stairs to the balcony, quickly.\nBOSWYCK: THE THREE OF THEM CLIMB THE STAIRS. AS THEY CLIMB THEY TALK.\nCONSTANCE: (CLIMBING) Why?\nBOSWYCK: (CLIMBING) You wanted to know where the nutrients came from,\nBOSWYCK: didn’t you?\nCONSTANCE: (CLIMBING) Yes, but...\nBOSWYCK: (CLIMBING) I’m showing you.\nBOSWYCK: THEY REACH THE TOP.\nBOSWYCK: Here we are. Look down into the chapel. What do you see?\nASTA: Brothers, kneeling down before the altar.\nCONSTANCE: One of them has a chalice. Is it a communion?\nBOSWYCK: An unholy one.\nASTA: Now that one’s bringing out — wait, is that a syringe?\nCONSTANCE: I believe it is.\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 50\nASTA: Why would they need syringes at a.. (TRAILS OFF)\nCONSTANCE: Because they’re siphoning their blood into the chalice.\nASTA: That’s horrible!\nBOSWYCK: The creatures demand that each member of our order donates a little blood each day, in order to keep these creatures alive.\nCONSTANCE: The Doctor needs to see this.\nBELOW: CHAPEL DOORS BANG OPEN AS DOCTOR AND PENDLE ARE DRAGGED IN.\nPENDLE: (BELOW) Unhand us!\nDOCTOR: (BELOW) Raspak, this is totally unnecessary!\nASTA: I think he’s about to.\nCROSS TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. The ‘nutrient’ the Abbot spoke of. You want our blood!\nRASPAK: The brothers willingly donate what little they can. I expect you and your friend to donate a whole lot more.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be a fool, Raspak. Can’t you see you’re being used?\nRASPAK: No, it is you who will be used. Now kneel and make your offering.\nPENDLE: Do something, Doctor!!!\nCROSS BACK TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 52\nCROSS BACK TO: NB: SOTTO VOICES.\nCONSTANCE: We have to do something.\nBOSWYCK: There are too many of them.\nASTA: We can’t just watch them leached!\nCROSS BACK TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 53\nDOOR: BANGS AS HABRILD HURRIES INTO THE CHAPEL.\nHABRILD: Raspak! Raspak!!!\nRASPAK: (IRRITATED) What is it, Habrild?\nHABRILD: We’ve found something. On the moor. Another of the strangers’ caravans. A blue box!\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Just when I thought things couldn’t get any worse...\nHABRILD: It’s being brought into the courtyard now.\nRASPAK: I must inform the Abbot. Take over here. Drain the curly-haired one white while his colleague watches. Perhaps that will make him a little more cooperative.\nPENDLE: But — I can’t bear the sight of blood!\nDOCTOR: Poor you, Pendle. It’s not your blood they’1l be draining!\nRASPAK: (AS HE DEPARTS) I will return shortly.\nCROSS TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 54\nASTA: There’s just three of them with the Doctor and Pendle now.\nCONSTANCE: So this is our chance.\nBOSWYCK: What are you intending?\nCONSTANCE: (RUSHING OFF) Something. Anything!\nCROSS TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR: IS FORCED TO HIS KNEES AT THE ALTAR.\nDOCTOR: Ow! (TO GUARD) Many modern places of worship provide cushions for your knees. I hope you’re going to sterilise that needle.\nPENDLE: How can you be so flippant!\nDOCTOR: You can catch all sorts of things off a dirty needle, you know. Lockjaw, tetanus, not to mention staphylococcal infections. — Oh good, they’re taking it away.\nPENDLE: Yes, but they’re fetching a knife...!\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR: SUDDENLY, FROM BEHIND:\nCONSTANCE: Excuse me, chaps, I don’t suppose any of you could point my friend and I in the direction of the ladies’ room?\nHABRILD: (SHOCKED) Women? But... women are not allowed here.\nASTA: What a medieval attitude.\nHABRILD: Brothers, seize those women! Raspak will want to question them!\nBOSWYCK: (COMING UP BEHIND CONSTANCE AND ASTA) No, novice Habrild. These strangers are in my charge.\nHABRILD: Master Boswyck. You sent me to the kitchens when I was not needed! I think these demons have you under their spell!\nCONSTANCE: We’re not demons.\nHABRILD: Demons, women — what’s the difference?\nHABRILD: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: Perhaps, if I might intervene? Guard — perhaps you could reach inside my colleague Mr Pendle’s bag...?\nHABRILD: Wait. Why...?\nDOCTOR: There you’ll find a small brown box, with a strap.\nGUARD: DIGGING IN PENDLE’S BAG.\nPENDLE: Your ‘Box Brownie’? But —\nDOCTOR: There, that’s it. Go on, novice Habrild. Take it.\nHABRILD: (TAKING IT) Why? What is it?\nDOCTOR: It’s a portable demon detector. Look through the viewfinder — the glass eye. Point it at the women, then press the button on the top.\nBOX: BROWNIE SHUTTER CLICKS.\nHABRILD: Now what?\nDOCTOR: Now, we have to send the film to be developed. It might take a week.\nHABRILD: A week? Then what use is that?\nDOCTOR: What use? Well, it has distracted you long enough to enable Master Boswyck to sneak around your guards —\nTWO: GUARDS’ HEADS KNOCKED TOGETHER. CLONKED. FALL TO FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: . and knock their heads together. Thank you, Master Boswyck.\nHABRILD: Master Boswyck? Then these demons have compelled you...!\nHABRILD: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 57\nBOSWYCK: Habrild, you’re an idiot. If you really do believe these women to be demons...\nASTA: . then why have you turned your back on us?\nHABRILD: (TURNING) Whuh?\nCONSTANCE: Well done, Asta.\nASTA: Ow! His jaw was really hard...\nPENDLE: (OUTRAGE) Probationary assessor Asta, I am appalled! “We must make our presence known in a non-aggressive way” — remember?\nASTA: I was saving your life, sir!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Thank you, Asta. You too, Mrs Clarke. A few more moments...\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. The aliens. The crash survivors. We’ve met them.\nASTA: They’re Daleks!\nDOCTOR: (AGHAST) Daleks!!!\nCONSTANCE: Why, have you heard of them before?\nPENDLE: But this is terrible news! Terrible! We shall all be killed.\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) How many of them are there?\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 58\nCONSTANCE: We saw two, but there are at least another two being kept alive inside animal carcasses.\nDOCTOR: Our ‘nutrients’ were meant for them, no doubt.\nBOSWYCK: Please. The guards will wake soon. It’s not safe to stay here.\nDOCTOR: I should say not, Master Boswyck.\nBOSWYCK: Follow me, we’ll hide in my chambers.\nBOSWYCK: THEY HURRY OFF AFTER BOSWYCK.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 59\nBOSWYCK: RASPAK AND TANAPAL ENTER THE COURTYARD.\nRASPAK: See, your holiness? Another vessel found on the moorland. Although how a box such as this may fly, I cannot imagine...\nTANAPAL: But I can. I know this object, Brother Raspak! (BEAT; REALISATION) But that means...\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 60\nTANAPAL: FADE UP. DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, PENDLE AND ASTA HURRY INSIDE.\nBOSWYCK: Hurry, all of you!\nBOSWYCK: CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.\nBOSWYCK: The alarm may be raised at any moment. I doubt I can conceal you for long.\nDOCTOR: That’s the least of our problems. On a world like this, we’re just not equipped to fight Daleks.\nASTA: If it’s any consolation, I don’t know that they’re equipped to fight us. They didn’t seem to have any energy weapons, just spikes where their guns should be.\nDOCTOR: Spikes?!\nBOSWYCK: The brothers have built the creatures new casings, from materials to hand.\nDOCTOR: What ‘materials’?\nCONSTANCE: Bent lead and stained glass. I thought them rather beautiful.\nDOCTOR: I need to see these ‘beautiful’ Daleks.\nPENDLE: They’11 kill you on sight!\nDOCTOR: Then I’d better make sure that they don’t see me, hadn’t I? — Master Boswyck, I don’t suppose you could lend me some robes?\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 61\nDOOR: BANGS AS RASPAK AND THE ABBOT HURRY INTO THE CHAPEL.\nTANAPAL: You are sure, Raspak? One of the merchants called the other ‘Doctor’?\nRASPAK: Certain, your holiness. Why, is it important?\nTANAPAL: If that is the case, he cannot die yet. Not before we have questioned him—\nTANAPAL: HE BREAKS OFF, SEEING THE EMPTY ALTAR.\nTANAPAL: Where is he? Where is the Doctor, and his companion?\nRASPAK: I — I do not know. Novice Habrild? What happened here?\nHABRILD: (GROANING) Raspak. There were demons here...\nRASPAK: Demons?\nHABRILD: Worse, two of them were... were women. (FAINTS AGAIN)\nRASPAK: Wake up, you fool!\nTANAPAL: Leave him. Raise the alarm, Raspak. The Doctor and his associates must be located!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 62\nTANAPAL: FADE UP. BOSWYCK LEADS DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, PENDLE AND ASTA ALONG.\nDOCTOR: Really, I wish you’d all stayed behind in Boswyck’s quarters. It’d be far better for me to proceed alone.\nCONSTANCE: Having gone to all the trouble of rescuing you, I’m not letting you out of my sight.\nASTA: I feel a lot safer, staying together like this.\nPENDLE: Agreed.\nPENDLE: 4 x MONKS RUSHING NOISILY, IN THE NEXT CORRIDOR.\nBOSWYCK: Quiet!\nRASPAK: (WELL OFF) Search everywhere, brothers! The Abbot commands the strangers must be found!\nRASPAK: THE FOOTSTEPS RECEDE.\nPENDLE: You hear that? They’re searching the monastery.\nCONSTANCE: Then how are we going to get to the East Range unseen?\nBOSWYCK: There is a secret passageway.\nDOCTOR: That’s handy.\nBOSWYCK: There are many secret tunnels in the monastery. A relic of more violent times when our brothers had to hide from soldiers of the state. Here, help me with this tapestry.\nMOVING: HEAVY TAPESTRY ASIDE THROUGH:\nMOVING: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 63\nBOSWYCK: I arranged to have this entrance covered up, after Rosco and Gabber sneaked inside, wanting to see the visitors from the stars for themselves. Gabber came face-to-face with one of the creatures in its naked form. He has not spoken since...\nCONSTANCE: Their naked form?\nDOCTOR: It’s not pleasant.\nBOSWYCK: Hold the tapestry firm while I unlock the door.\nBOSWYCK: BEGINS TO UNLOCK DOOR.\nDOCTOR: This passage leads directly to the Dalek workshop?\nBOSWYCK: Indeed. But we must be careful. The Dalek creatures use these passages to travel through the monastery undetected.\nDOCTOR: In which case, I really must insist that I proceed [alone. ]\nOVER: THIS, MORE RUSHING FOOTSTEPS FROM OFF.\nPENDLE: I hear more guards!\nASTA: They’re coming this way!\nCONSTANCE: Everyone, inside the passageway, now!\nCONSTANCE: AS EVERYONE BUNDLES INSIDE THE PASSAGEWAY :\nDOCTOR: But—\nCONSTANCE: No arguing, Doctor. There’s nothing else to be done!\nTAPESTRY: ‘FLUMPS’ HEAVILY BACK OVER DOORWAY.\nTAPESTRY: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 64\nQUICK: FADE UP. BOSWYCK LEADS DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, PENDLE AND ASTA ALONG.\nBOSWYCK: Stay close. There are many junctions and dead ends. I got lost in here for days once, when I was a mere novice.\nDOCTOR: You’re a man after my own heart, Boswyck. The tunnels beneath the Panopticon on Gallifrey were [my playground, too —]\nPENDLE: Is this really the time for boyhood reminiscences!\nCONSTANCE: [Oh, once he gets going...]\nDISTANTLY: — 2 x DALEKS IN MOTION ALONG STONE FLOOR.\nASTA: (HISSED) Will you all be quiet! (HUSHED) I think I hear something at the junction ahead.\nASTA: BEAT, SO WE CAN HEAR APPROACHING DALEKS.\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) You’re right, coming along one of the other tunnels.\nBOSWYCK: (HUSHED) Quickly, everyone. Back against the wall. Stay silent.\nEVERYONE: PRESSES THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALL. THE TWO DALEKS\nGLIDE: DOWN THE CORRIDOR.\nDALEK: #1: (APPROACHING) Why have been been ordered to leave the construction work?\nDALEK: #2: (APPROACHING) We are instructed to join the Black Dalek.\nDALEK: #1: (CLOSEST) Construction of the remaining casings will be\nDALEK: delayed. More Dalek units must be made operational.\nDALEK: #2: (RECEDING) Orders of the Black Dalek take priority. Proceed!\nDALEKS: RECEDE DOWN THE CORRIDOR. BEAT.\nDALEKS: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 65\nPENDLE: (EXHALING) Oh, my heart. I felt certain that they would discover us.\nDOCTOR: Well, I see what you mean about their new casings. Very snazzy.\nASTA: I wonder where they were off to in such a hurry?\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) Yes, I wonder...\nCONSTANCE: Never mind that. By the sound of it, they’ve left their workshop unguarded.\nBOSWYCK: Indeed. We should make the most of this happy situation.\nBOSWYCK: THEY HURRY DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL)\nRASPAK: MARCHES IN.\nRASPAK: Page 66\nRASPAK: Your holiness. The brothers are searching every part of the\nRASPAK: monastery. I promise you, this Doctor will not escape.\nTANAPAL: Raspak. You have allowed him to escape twice already!\nRASPAK: He had help. Not just the women. Master Boswyck, too,\nTANAPAL: The herbalist!\nRASPAK: I’ve long had my doubts about Boswyck...\nTANAPAL: None shall escape. I shall ensure it.\nTANAPAL: GRINDING OF SECRET PASSAGEWAY BEHIND.\nRASPAK: How, your holiness?\nTANAPAL: I’m told.\nTANAPAL: I have called for assistance! (CLAPS HANDS) Brother Daleks —\nTANAPAL: enter!\nDALEKS: x 2: (EXITING PASSAGEWAY) We proceed...!\nTANAPAL: You understand the situation? The Doctor is here.\nDALEK: #1: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.\nDALEK: #2: He will seek to sabotage Dalek operations.\nDALEK: #1: He must be found, and exterminated.\nTANAPAL: Almost certainly he will try to gain access to his ship... his\nTANAPAL: TARDIS. — That must not be allowed to happen, Raspak.\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL)\nRASPAK: Page 67\nRASPAK: (TERRIFIED) I will ensure that it is guarded at all times.\nRASPAK: will not fail you, your holiness.\nTANAPAL: Go, Raspak. Obey your orders. Find the Doctor.\nTANAPAL: 2 x DALEKS: Seek. Locate. Exterminate.\nRASPAK: At once, brother Daleks!\nRASPAK: LEAVES, THE DOOR SHUTTING BEHIND HIM.\nRASPAK: I\nRASPAK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 68\nORGANIC: DALEK HEARTBEAT THROBS AWAY IN BACKGROUND AS BOSWYCK\nLEADS: DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, PENDLE AND ASTA IN.\nBOSWYCK: Here, Doctor. Here is where the creatures have made their lair.\nDOCTOR: What a load of old rubbish.\nCONSTANCE: (ADMONISHING) Master Boswyck’s trying to help us, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Eh? (REALISATION) Not figuratively, literally! I meant all junk-!\nKICKS: METAL FRAGMENTS. CLATTERING.\nDOCTOR: Scrap retrieved from the crash site, I presume.\nCONSTANCE: Their vessel must have hit the ground at quite a speed, if was all that could be recovered.\nBOSWYCK: Many of the creatures died.\nDOCTOR: Lucky for you that they did.\nPENDLE: (SNIFFING THE AIR) It stinks...!\nDOCTOR: Something’s not right, that’s for sure.\nPENDLE: I meant literally, not figuratively. Ugh!\nASTA: Doctor, look.\nASTA: PICKS UP SOME METAL FRAGMENTS.\nASTA: Were these Dalek casings, do you think?\nASTA: this\nASTA: this\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: Smashed to pieces. Not easy to smelt, Dalekanium. No wonder they needed new ones made.\nCONSTANCE: (JUST OFF) Like these, for instance-?\nDOCTOR: (GOING OVER) Like those, Mrs Clarke! Only halfway finished, but I can’t fault the craftsmanship. Magnificent!\nCONSTANCE: So the Dalek creatures sit inside these casings?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nCONSTANCE: But how do they control them? Where’s the machinery?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks have a certain psychokinetic ability, used in tandem with their technology. (THOUGHTFUL) But in the absence of that technology, they must be entirely reliant on that ability. Their mental powers must be rather more developed than I thought...\nASTA: (OFF) Doctor, look at this.\nDOCTOR: What’s that you’ve found, Asta? (SEEING IT) Ah! The Daleks’ transmitter!\nASTA: That’s what I thought.\nPENDLE: The device that brought us here. Smash it, Asta! Switch it off!\nDOCTOR: No, no, you mustn’t!\nPENDLE: But it’s dangerous! A siren signal, you said, drawing unwary travellers onto the rocks?\nDOCTOR: Yes yes yes. But if I’m not mistake, they’ve cannibalised parts of their saucer’s black box recorder to build it.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 70\nPENDLE: So?\nDOCTOR: So...\nDOCTOR: BEEPS AND CLICKS AS THE DOCTOR TINKERS WITH THE CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR: If I can just access the recorder’s memory, I should be able to see exactly what brought the Daleks to this sector in the first place...\nSOFT: ‘SCROLLING’ SOUND CONTINUES UNDER:\nDOCTOR: Got it! Yes. This was a Dalek assault team. Part of a battle fleet involved in the invasion of the planet Kantra. But their Saucer sustained some damage. It was on its way back to Skaro when its main drive unit gave out.\nCONSTANCE: Hence the crash.\nDOCTOR: Hence the crash... Good heavens!\nASTA: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No wonder these Daleks have such highly developed mental abilities. They were an elite squad — part of the Emperor's personal guard, no less. (BEAT) Now that’s odd. There were a dozen Daleks aboard the saucer when it crashed. Most of them died on impact, but the Black Dalek — the saucer commander — survived, along with four others.\nCONSTANCE: Hang on, we only know of four. The two that are already mobile, and the two destined for these new casings.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. So what’s happened to the fifth? What’s happened to the Black Dalek?\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 71\nDALEK: #1: Whilst the Doctor is at liberty our plans are in danger.\nDALEK: #2: Dalek slaves must gain access to humans’ ship.\nDALEK: #1: Reacquisition of energy weapons must become our first priority.\nTANAPAL: No. Boosting the range of our transmitter must remain the first priority. Raspak and his guards are more than capable of handling the Doctor and his friends, without the use of energy weapons.\nDALEK: #2: Their weaponry is primitive and inefficient.\nTANAPAL: Against a superior force, I would agree. But the Doctor is not a superior force. He is a pacifist. A weakness that will prove his undoing!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 72\nORGANIC: HEARTBEAT IN BACKGROUND. DOOR OPENS, OFF.\nASTA: Doctor, the door!\nPENDLE: Guards! Oh, mercy!\nPENDLE: SHUFFLING FROM OFF AS 4 x NOVICES APPROACH.\nBOSWYCK: There is no need for alarm. It is the novices whose duty it is to build these casings.\nCONSTANCE: It’s like they’ve not seen us. What’s wrong with them?\nBOSWYCK: Their every waking thought is focused upon the task in hand.\nDOCTOR: Conditioned, more like it. Or drugged. Still, perhaps if we just leave them be...\nPENDLE: One of them might yet raise the alarm.\nBOSWYCK: No. Each of those chosen to undertake this secret work has taken a vow of silence.\nDOCTOR: It’s not just a vow of silence that keeps them mute, though. Look at their throats.\nCONSTANCE: They look like surgical scars.\nASTA: Surgery? Why?\nBOSWYCK: The Daleks need casings to move about in... but in order for them to speak...\nDOCTOR: These poor wretches have donated their larynxes, not just their blood.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 73\nCONSTANCE: That’s horrible.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it, just. The Abbot, he’s the key to all this. If I can persuade him to help us, he can help unite the entire brotherhood against the Daleks.\nCONSTANCE: (INCREDULOUS) But he was the one who sent you to have your throat cut, remember!\nBOSWYCK: The Abbot Tanapal I once knew would never have sanctioned such barbarism.\nDOCTOR: Exactly! I believe that the Daleks are influencing the Abbot is some way.\nCONSTANCE: Nonsense. He’s just collaborating!\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t think so. The last time I was in his presence, I had the sense that he trying to tell me something. That strange pressure in my mind...\nPENDLE: You and your ‘mental twinges’!\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m guessing that the Abbot has been subjected to Dalek conditioning — just like these poor mutes! But if I were to help break that conditioning, our situation might be very different.\nASTA: Doctor, am I correct in my assessment that you wish to speak to the Abbot alone?\nDOCTOR: You are, yes.\nASTA: So it would help if Raspak’s guards were out of the way?\nDOCTOR: It would.\nASTA: Then we must create some distraction.\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 74\nPENDLE: ‘We’, Asta? ‘We’?!\nASTA: You, me, Mrs Clarke and Master Boswyck — if that’s alright?\nCONSTANCE: I’m game if you are.\nBOSWYCK: I, too, am ‘game’.\nASTA: Good. We’1ll draw the guards away, and meet you back at Master Boswyck’s quarters. Would that be agreeable, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Most agreeable.\nPENDLE: But—\nASTA: Then we’re all agreed — aren’t we, Assessor?\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 75\nASTA: FADE UP. TINKLING OF WINDCHIMES AS BEFORE. RASPAK STRIDES IN.\nTANAPAL: Raspak. Has any progress been made with the strangers’ ship?\nRASPAK: No, my lord. The blacksmith has managed to remove several panels from the hull, but so far access to the interior of the vessel eludes him.\nSUDDENLY: BELL BEGINS CLANGING QUICKLY. WELL OFF.\nTANAPAL: He must try harder! We must gain access to that ship. — Are you listening, Raspak?\nRASPAK: The chapel bell, your holiness! That’s no call to prayers! My guards must have caught up with the strangers!\nTANAPAL: Then go after them, Raspak!\nRASPAK: At once, your holiness.\nRASPAK: HURRIES AWAY. DOOR SLAMS. BEAT. DOOR OPENS AGAIN. DOCTOR ENTERS THE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: There you are, Abbot. A word, if I may...?\nTANAPAL: Doctor. I see now. Your friends have distracted my guards.\nDOCTOR: Is it so very obvious? A crude ploy, but nonetheless effective— (BREAKS OFF) ‘Doctor’?\nBELL: STOPS.\nTANAPAL: You were foolish to return here.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. You see, every time we’ve met, I’ve sensed that there’s something you’ve been trying to tell me. (COMING CLOSER) Well, when I say ‘you’, I mean the real Abbot Tanapal, not the Daleks’ stooge.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 76\nTANAPAL: Keep away!\nDOCTOR: I’m right, aren’t I? — The mind of the true Abbot is locked up\nDOCTOR: somewhere in that shaven head, trying to get out. Fortunately,\nDOCTOR: I’m here to help him. (URGENT) Fight it, Tanapal. Fight against the Dalek conditioning!\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: (IE, POSSESSED TANAPAL — HIS VOICE BECOME MUCH MORE DALEK-LIKE, BUT UNMODULATED) You are mistaken, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. By the sounds of it the Dalek pushing the Abbot’s buttons is having to fight to retain control. Where are hiding, hm? Behind the drapes? Is that it? Literally, the power behind the Abbot’s throne?\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: Keep away from the curtain!\nDOCTOR: This chamber’s furnished so simply, you can’t be anywhere else.\nDOCTOR: PHYSICALLY TEARS BACK DRAPES — RIPPING FABRIC.\nDOCTOR: And there you are. The Black Dalek. Now let go of your puppet!\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: We will exterminate you, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Without energy weapons? I don’t think so. So do as I ask, and relinquish control of the Abbot!\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: You misunderstand, Doctor. The Abbot has not been subject to Dalek conditioning.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: We have achieved communion inside the Abbot’s psyche. Our minds are working in symbiosis!\nDOCTOR: (HORRIFIED) No, that’s not possible.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 77\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK:\nTANAPAL: Soon, we will invade the minds of every being in this galaxy and beyond.

Master Boswyck — the black flowers on the windowsill: are they what gave your Brotherhood their name?\nBOSWYCK: (CURTLY) Yes, but they’re of no interest.\nCONSTANCE: They’re beautiful. Like an orchid, but the petals are iridescent, almost metallic. And as for their scent —\nBOSWYCK: (SNAPPING) I said, they’re of no interest!\nCONSTANCE: (TAKEN ABACK) I’m sorry.\nBOSWYCK: I... picked them for the purpose of preparing a potion, that’s all.\nSEVERAL: PAIRS OF RUNNING FEET BEHIND DOOR, IN CORRIDOR.\nHABRILD: (RUNNING, IN CORRIDOR) Quickly.

(CLIMBING IN) I must apologise for the most unorthodox entrance. I got lost in the passageways, and the only way out I could find [led me]\nCONSTANCE: Never mind all that. Are we to presume that you didn’t manage to get the Abbot on our side?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t, no.\nPENDLE: (SNORTS) Huh!\nDOCTOR: I did, however, learn something of vital importance. Things are far, far worse than I realised.\nCONSTANCE: Worse?\nDOCTOR: The Black Dalek has found some way to put its mind inside that of the Abbot. They’re sharing some strange symbiosis.\nPENDLE: (SCOFFS) ‘Symbiosis’!\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: Please, Mr Pendle. It’s not necessary to heckle.\nCONSTANCE: How are they doing this, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That I didn’t discover. But if I don’t find out — the consequences could be disastrous. Not just for this planet, but the entire civilised cosmos!\nBOSWYCK: (TENTATIVELY) I... may be able to help answer that question.\nDOCTOR: Really, Master Boswyck?\nBOSWYCK: Not here. The answer, I believe, lies outside these walls.\nDOCTOR: Well — we may never have a better chance to escape the monastery than now, while the guards are distracted.\nBOSWYCK: Come, then, all of you. We must hurry.\nASTA: We can’t just leave! What about the shuttle?\nDOCTOR: Asta’s right, if the Daleks gain access to the shuttle’s transmitter, they can bring in reinforcements.\nCONSTANCE: Well, then, the answer’s simple. If we want to stop the Daleks getting hold of the transmitter, all we have to do is get inside the ship and remove it without their noticing.\nPENDLE: ‘AL?\nASTA: Constance is right. It’s getting dark, we can sneak in through\nASTA: the emergency hatch and be gone without anyone knowing.\nCONSTANCE: I’m willing to give it a try.\nBOSWYCK: OPENS DOOR.\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 84\nBOSWYCK: Doctor, if we are to leave without being seen then we need to do so now.\nDOCTOR: Well, all right. But promise me you’1ll be careful, Mrs Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: I wasn’t actually waiting for your say-so.\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t suppose you were. Come on then, Pendle.\nPENDLE: Can’t I stay here?\nDOCTOR: Asta and Constance are going to require stealth and speed if\nDOCTOR: they’re to remain undetected, and neither you nor I are built for either.

(PATS RUMP OF A SLEEM) Yes, these Sleem will do nicely.\nDOCTOR: Ah, so these are Sleem!\nBOSWYCK: We use them as beasts of burden, but they can be fleet of foot when the need arises.\nPENDLE: You surely don’t expect me to ride one of these things?\nBOSWYCK: We shall need them to carry supplies.\nROSCO: I asked Allget the Unready for planna bread. I told him it was for the prisoners’ last meal.\nBOSWYCK: Very enterprising of you, Rosco.\nROSCO: I’m not sure he believed me, though, Master Boswyck. He said he’d check with Raspak.\nBOSWYCK: Then I suppose you two boys must come with us.\nDOCTOR: Am I to take it we have a long journey ahead?\nBOSWYCK: We do. Come on.\nALL: SET OFF INTO THE NIGHT, WITH SLEEM.\nALL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 86\nALL: FADE UP. 2 x BROTHERS HAMMERING HULL OF SHUTTLE, OFF.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) The brothers haven’t given up on the shuttle, then.\nASTA: (SOTTO) Yes, they’ve managed to get a section of the heat shielding off. That’s given them access to the hull below.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Surely they won’t be able to get through that, though? If it’s strong enough to withstand travelling through space...\nASTA: (SOTTO) Space travel is about dealing with extremes of hot and cold, and the occasional micrometeorite. It’s not about being attacked with pickaxes and hammers!\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Can you see this ‘emergency hatch’?\nASTA: (SOTTO) Yes. But it’s in full view of the main gates. And there are guards. (SIGHS) What was I thinking, trying this?\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) It’s nearly dark. They’re monks — perhaps they’1l break for evensong, or vespers, or something.\nASTA: (SOTTO) Perhaps.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) We’re just going to have to wait for our moment.\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 87\nCONSTANCE: FADE UP.

We’1ll rest here for a while before going on.\nPENDLE: Thank goodness. (HE SLUMPS ONTO THE GROUND)\nPENDLE: ROSCO AND GABBER STAY SLEEM.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps now you might tell us exactly where we’re going, Master Boswyck.\nBOSWYCK: You wanted to know how the Black Dalek might have managed to imprint its thoughts inside the Abbot’s mind? I believe it has something to do with a secret our Brotherhood has guarded for centuries. A secret that lies in the mountains, that until recently was known only to a few of us...\nROSCO: (APPALLED) Master, surely you wouldn’t...\nBOSWYCK: I have no choice, young Rosco.\nROSCO: (GETTING ANGRIER) But you cannot! You have taken a vow. These people are not holy!\nBOSWYCK: These people are our only hope.\nROSCO: I thought that you meant only to help these people escape the monastery. But if you take them to the secret place, then you will have abandoned your sacred trust!\nBOSWYCK: Rosco, please...\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 88\nROSCO: No! — Gabber, come on. We’re leaving. (BEAT) I mean it. We cannot be part of this. (BEAT) I have listened enough. (BEAT) Well, then — you be damned with them. I’1l1 have no part in this!\nROSCO: HE MOUNTS ONE OF THE SLEEM. IT BRAYS.\nBOSWYCK: Leave if you must, boy. But please, do not take one of our\nBOSWYCK: Sleem.\nROSCO: I shall not take one, Boswyck — no! (TO SLEEM) Ya! Ya!!!\nBOTH: SLEEM BRAY, THEN GALLOP OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.\nBOSWYCK: Rosco, come back. Rosco!\nBOSWYCK: THERE IS NOTHING.\nPENDLE: Without those creatures, we have no supplies! We’1ll never make\nPENDLE: it!\nDOCTOR: That, I believe, was young Rosco’s intent.\nBOSWYCK: We may yet prevail by foraging. But it will be hard.\nBOSWYCK: A DISTANT WOLF-LIKE HOWL, JOINED BY ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER.\nPENDLE: (TERRIFIED) W-what was that?\nBOSWYCK: It sounds like a pack of Vulteen.\nPENDLE: Vulteen? What are Vulteen?\nDOCTOR: I think we’d better get moving again before we find out.\nBOSWYCK: It’s another hour to the foot of the mountains.\nPENDLE: An hour!!!\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 89\nBOSWYCK: Gabber. Fetch wood. Build a fire. With luck, that will keep the\nBOSWYCK: Vulteen at bay...\nVULTEEN: CONTINUE TO HOWL.

Improvised Dalek weaponry is not fit for purpose.\nDALEK: #2: There is a way. But we shall require humanoid assistance.\nDALEK: 2 x DALEKS GLIDE AWAY.\nASTA: What was that about?\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure. But I get the impression that our time might be running out...\nASTA: The hatchway’s just here.

Follow me, we’ll feel our way to the cockpit.\nCONSTANCE: Can’t we contact your superiors? Get help?\nASTA: Only from orbit. But if we were to try to launch the shuttle from the confines of this courtyard, the backblast might damage or destroy it.\nCONSTANCE: Safer we just stick to the plan to disable the transmitter.\nASTA: I think so. (ARRIVING IN COCKPIT) Here we are. — Computer. Allow access to communications console.\nASTA: BLEEP; HISS AS CONSOLE OPENS.\nCONSTANCE: It looks complicated.\nASTA: It’s just the transmitter circuits we need to disable. — Computer, disconnect power to console circuits.\nCONFIRMING: BLEEP.\nASTA: Right.

Constance, something’s trying to get in through the exhaust!\nCONSTANCE: (SLOWLY) “If Dalek slaves cannot enter the vessel, a Dalek must do so instead.”\nASTA: A Dalek couldn’t fit through the exhaust, any more than a\nASTA: human!\nCONSTANCE: No. But one of the creatures inside the Dalek casing might.\nMORE: SCRABBLING. MORE SQUEALING.\nMORE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 94\nCRACKLING: FIRE.\nPENDLE: I think the fire’s scared those Vulteen off.\nBOSWYCK: I hope so.\nDOCTOR: Master Boswyck — since we have a few moments to talk, perhaps you can tell me how the Daleks went from being crash survivors in need of help, to controlling the entire brotherhood?\nBOSWYCK: Most of it I have told you already. We did our best to heal their wounds, and began to construct the casings they told us they needed to survive. The Daleks promised Tanapal they would show him how to broadcast our creed across the heavens, by rebuilding their ‘transmitter’. He succumbed first to their temptation, and then to their will.\nDOCTOR: But surely the others must have noticed?\nBOSWYCK: The Abbot is infallible, that is how our Order has always worked.\nDOCTOR: But how did they do it? Take over the Abbot’s every thought?\nBOSWYCK: Our order has always enjoyed a special relationship with the world, Doctor, a communion with nature. Take young Gabber. Mute, and yet his brother seems to understand his every thought...\nDOCTOR: A common enough trait in twin siblings.\nBOSWYCK: Ah, but it’s more than just [that...]\nVULTEEN: HOWLS. ANOTHER ANSWERS. AND ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER. FROM\nALL: AROUND.\nPENDLE: Vulteen! They’re all around us! I thought they’d gone...!\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR: Listen. I don’t think they’re trying to scare us. I think they’re communicating with one other...!\nBOSWYCK: They are not without intelligence.\nPENDLE: Well, what are they saying?\nDOCTOR: At a guess: ‘spread out, make a circle, then draw in for the kill’?\nBOSWYCK: We must arm ourselves! Gabber — make torches!\nBOSWYCK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 96\nMORE: SCRABBLING. MORE SQUEALING. LOUDER.\nASTA: That thing’s behind the interior bulkheads now. We’ve got to get out of here!\nCONSTANCE: The transmitter, Asta. We have to finish the job!\nASTA: Yes, yes, of course. (EFFORT — TRYING TO PULL OUT WITH CIRCUIT BOARD) It’s useless, the circuit’s stuck!\nCONSTANCE: (FEELING AROUND) Hold on. I can feel it. — Yes, there’s one connection still attached.

It’s free! — Right, let’s get out of here before...\nDALEK: MUTANT SQUEALS UP CLOSE.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Before that thing makes it past the bulkhead, were you about to say?\nASTA: (SOTTO) Yes...!\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) I think it already has.

What if there’s a fire in here, what do you do?!\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 97\nASTA: There’s an emergency release switch.\nCONSTANCE: Where?!\nASTA: Somewhere beside the hatch. To your right!\nANOTHER: TERRIFYING SCRABBLING. STOPS.\nCONSTANCE: (FEELING AROUND) I’ve got it, I think. Like a handle?\nASTA: No, just a switch.\nCONSTANCE: Then what am I holding...?\nSUDDEN: EXPLOSION OF SOUND — THE MUTANT ATTACKS CONSTANCE.\nSQUEALING: FRANTICALLY.\nASTA: Constance!\nCONSTANCE: (FIGHTING MUTANT) Get that hatch open!!! Hurry!!!\nASTA: (FEELING AROUND) I’m trying!\nCONSTANCE: (TO MUTANT) Stupid thing, you should have known better than attack a woman with a screwdriver in her free hand...!\nSTABS: MUTANT WITH SCREWDRIVER.

Something to do with that black flower Boswyck was so protective of.\nCONSTANCE: (COMING OVER) Really?\nASTA: The ‘dream flower’, it says. ‘By which means the mind and the world may be linked, in symbiosis...’\nCONSTANCE: Symbiosis...?\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 105\nCONSTANCE: GABBER, DOCTOR, BOSWYCK AND PENDLE REACH THE TOP OF A RISE.\nPENDLE: Why’s the boy stopped?\nBOSWYCK: Our destination is just over this rise.\nDOCTOR: One last heave, Mr Pendle.\nPENDLE: (EFFORT; BEAT) Is this it? — There’s nothing here. It’s just a valley full of flowers!\nDOCTOR: Black flowers. There was one of these plants in your apothecary, Boswyck...!\nBOSWYCK: The answers that you seek are to be found in this valley, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) And I recognise them now. Ostrecallis Mediosai!\nPENDLE: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: The Dream Flower, native to the planet Ostrecallis Major. I thought it went extinct when the entire Ostrecallis system was consumed by a meganova!\nPENDLE: ‘Meganova’ ...?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry about it. — And yet somehow, these remarkable flowers have survived. Their seeds drifting though space, driven by solar winds, perhaps?\nBOSWYCK: The flowers grow nowhere else, Doctor. They are unique to this valley. From their petals, we brothers long since learned to synthesise a liquid extract — ‘by which means the mind and the world may be linked, in symbiosis...’\nPENDLE: ‘Symbiosis’!\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: You consume the extract of the dream flower?\nBOSWYCK: So we may be as one with nature, and nature as one with us.\nDOCTOR: That’s one way of putting it. Extract of the Dream Flower was notorious for its hallucinogenic effects. And you say you take it?\nBOSWYCK: All the time. Have you never heard the grass grow, Doctor? Or a the ringing of the atoms inside a raindrop as it strikes the ground?\nDOCTOR: No I have not. And I can’t say I care to.\nBOSWYCK: Before the Daleks came, we lived in perfect harmony with nature. But now that balance has been altered.\nDOCTOR: Altered how?\nBOSWYCK: The Daleks used our lifeblood to grow stronger. But by absorbing our blood, their consciousness became part of the collective mind.\nDOCTOR: Overpowered it, more like.\nBOSWYCK: The Abbot himself was overwhelmed. Many of my brothers became cruel, and blindly obedient. When I realised what was happening, I withheld the extract from myself. Made myself an outcast from our collective mind. That is why I am weakened now.\nPENDLE: But you could have told us all this at the monastery!\nBOSWYCK: I did not bring you here for a guided tour. I brought you here to help me destroy the flowers.\nPENDLE: Destroy them?! Why?\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: Oh, I doubt that analysis of that chemical is beyond the Daleks. They’1l soon realise its potential. Take the secret back to Skaro, and they could manufacture it by the gallon!\nPENDLE: What?\nDOCTOR: Mix it into clouds, and the Dalek mind might literally rain down on a target planet. Whole planetary populations could fall under Dalek influence, just by turning on a tap.\nBOSWYCK: That is what I feared. So long as our way of life was a secret, we were safe. [But if the Daleks should be rescued by their own kind... ]\nOVER THIS: THE SOUND OF A SHUTTLE APPROACHING.\nPENDLE: Err... Doctor... Master Boswyck? — Look, in the sky.\nDOCTOR: Mm? — Oh! (BRIGHTLY — HE THINKS IT MIGHT BE CONSTANCE) Ohh...!\nPENDLE: That’s my shuttle!\nPENDLE: UNDER-SHUTTLE RETROS FIRE.\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Get back, everyone! It’s coming in to land...!\nBOSWYCK: (OVER NOISE) You don’t seem very troubled, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) I’1l give you good odds that Asta and Mrs Clarke found a way to fly the shuttle out!\nPENDLE: (OVER NOISE) You think?\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) I’ve learned to rely on Mrs Clarke! One of my most\nDOCTOR: constant companions, Constance!\nSHUTTLE: HAS LANDED. AS HATCH HISSES OPEN (AS EARLIER) :\nSHUTTLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 108\nPENDLE: But in that case... how did they know to find us here?\nDALEK: #1: (FROM HATCH) Doctor! You will surrender to the Daleks!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Why should I?\nPLASMA: BLAST STRIKES NEARBY.\nDALEK: #1: (FROM HATCH) Daleks have acquired plasma weaponry from the human vessel. We have regained our capacity to exterminate!\nPENDLE: Oh no!!!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) But I don’t understand — how did you find this place?\nPENDLE: I think they were helped. — Beside the Dalek. Look!\nROSCO: (FROM HATCH) Master Boswyck. You must surrender!\nBOSWYCK: (SHOCKED) Rosco. How could you betray us?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I doubt he had any choice in the matter. With every passing hour the Daleks’ malign influence gets stronger. The more of the extract they ingest, directly or indirectly, the greater their powers become.\nDALEK: #1: (FROM HATCH) The plants here will be harvested. Their extract will be synthesised.\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) Once this planet was a Garden of Eden. Soon it’1l be nothing more than a Dalek chemical factory.\nDALEK: #1: (FROM HATCH) Soon, the Order of the Daleks will reign supreme!\nDALEK: END OF PART THREE\nDALEK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 109"

Gabber and me.\nBOSWYCK: The debt I owe your brave brother can never be repaid, Rosco.\nDOCTOR: Yes it can, but only if we hurry. The Daleks have the components they need to repair the transmitter now, that much is plain. So it’s only a matter of time before they make contact with Skaro, and summon a whole invasion fleet to Strellin.\nBOSWYCK: Then the three of you must return to the monastery with all speed.\nDOCTOR: No, we can’t leave you here. That bite needs looking at, for one thing.\nBOSWYCK: I’m a herbalist, I can attend to my own injury. No, you must go without me.

But Boswyck’s parchments seem to suggest that these Dream Flowers maintain some kind of psychic balance here.\nASTA: (SCEPTICAL) So all the Abbot needs is a taste of this stuff, and his true personality will be restored?\nCONSTANCE: You’re sceptical.\nASTA: Is it obvious?\nCONSTANCE: Remember the Doctor’s mental twinges. What if the presence he sensed was the true Abbot, trying to make contact? If so — he might be the only person in the monastery who can help us.\nASTA: And if we’re completely wrong about all this?\nCONSTANCE: Then this is a very, very stupid idea. But you heard the shuttle take flight, just as I did. The situation’s desperate enough to justify an educated guess.\nASTA: Admit it, we’re flailing around in the dark.\nCONSTANCE: Not for much longer.

(TURNS CORNER) What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: Looking for the way to the Abbot’s chambers. I’m glad to see you're safe.\nCONSTANCE: Likewise. Doctor, we took the transmitter from the shuttle.\nASTA: But then the Daleks took it from us, I’m afraid.\nPENDLE: Yes, we know. You should have destroyed it, Asta!\nASTA: A Dalek mutant came after us! We nearly died!\nDOCTOR: Time enough for recriminations later.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 120\nROSCO: The Abbot’s chambers are this way, Doctor.\nASTA: Yes, that’s where we’ve come from!\nDOCTOR: Oh, really?\nCONSTANCE: It’s a long story. We hoped to use an extract of the essence of the Dream Flower to restore the Abbot’s control.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That was my plan too!\nPENDLE: Asta? Am I to take it you know all about these ‘dream flowers’?\nASTA: We read Boswyck’s scrolls.\nPENDLE: Then I could have stayed here, rather than endure that ghastly trial on the moorland...!\nDOCTOR: Never mind that now. — Mrs Clarke, am I to take it you failed in your mission?\nCONSTANCE: We couldn’t get close enough. But I’m sure the Abbot would help us, if he could only break free of the Black Dalek’s dominance.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Rosco — change of plan. Can you show my friends the way to the Daleks’ workshop?\nROSCO: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: Hopefully, the Black Dalek will soon summon his cohorts to the Abbot’s side. That should give you the opportunity to disable that transmitter.\nCONSTANCE: You’re going to the Abbot’s chamber alone?\nDOCTOR: It was a good plan. It’s worth another try.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 121\nCONSTANCE: But how on Earth do you think that you can...

Constance and I will be far more exposed, out in the open!\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 127\nPENDLE: (DEEP BREATH) Oh, very well.\nROSCO: Follow me.\nROSCO: PENDLE AND ROSCO SCURRY AWAY. AS THEY DO SO THERE IS A WHINE OF POWER FROM THE TRANMITTER.\nDALEK: #2: Sub-space carrier established. Opening channel to main Dalek fleet.\nASTA: They’d better hurry, I think that Dalek’s about to transmit!\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 128\nTANAPAL: IS SLOWLY WINNING HIS FIGHT FOR MENTAL DOMINANCE.\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: (EFFORT) Raspak! To me! I need you.\nDOCTOR: Hear that, Tanapal? The Black Dalek’s rattled. He knows he’s losing his grip. You’re winning!\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: (EFFORT) Doctor. When Raspak arrives with his guards, I shall have them eviscerate you!\nDOCTOR: ‘Eviscerate’? That’s a new one. But whatever you call it, it’s still murder!\nTANAPAL: (HUMAN PART) Yes, murder...!\nDOCTOR: Murder committed by men of peace!\nTANAPAL: (HUMAN) Doctor, the Dalek, I can feel its hold weakening...\nDOCTOR: Fight it, Tanapal! Exorcise the Black Dalek from your mind!\nMAIN: DOORS BURST OPEN. RASPAK PLUS 2 x GUARDS RUSH IN.\nRASPAK: My Lord Abbot!\nTANAPAL: /BLACK DALEK: (EFFORT) Raspak! The Doctor is trying to poison my mind. He is trying to kill me!\nRASPAK: Then we shall slay him! With me, brothers...!\nDOCTOR: No, Raspak, no!\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 129\nORGANIC: HEARTBEAT IS STRONGER NOW AS ROSCO AND PENDLE SCURRY TO\nHALT: BESIDE THE 2 x WRIGGLING MUTANTS IN THEIR ANIMAL SACS.\nHALT: NB: SOTTO VOICES UNTIL INDICATED.\nPENDLE: Oh, the smell is just vile..!\nROSCO: Here is where the blood that feeds the creatures passes through into the Brandelak stomachs.\nPENDLE: But — I see no valve, nor taps. Oh, I knew this wouldn’t work!\nCHATTERING: SIGNAL FROM TRANSMITTER ON OTHER SIDE OF CHAMBER.\nDALEK: #2:\nDALEK: (OFF) Hailing main Dalek fleet. Black Dalek orders recovery saucer to planet Strellin. Repeat, Black Dalek orders recovery saucer to planet Strellin! Location data follows.\nLONG: STREAM OF CHITTERING DATA. OVER THIS.\nROSCO: We must lure the Dalek creature away from Constance and Asta.\nPENDLE: I know, I know! Perhaps if we just pull the tubes out from these horrid sacs —\nPENDLE: HE TUGS ON THE TUBE LEADING INTO THE LIFE SUPPORT SACS.\nPENDLE: Oh the feel of these tubes is quite ghastly. I shall be ill. I\nPENDLE: know it.\nROSCO: Hurry!!!\nPENDLE: PULLS A TUBE FREE. FLUID SPLASHES DOWN.\nPENDLE: There. That’s one of them [free. ]\nSUDDENLY: MUTANT IN SAC BEGINS TO SHRIEK. JOINED BY ANOTHER!\nPENDLE: (PAINED) Ahh! It’s deafening!!!\nPENDLE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 130\nDALEK: #2:\nDALEK: (OFF) Alert! Alert! Dalek life support system is failing. Dalek survivors must be protected. (MOVING OFF) Human slaves will assist. Hurry! Hurry!\nSLAVES: DOWN TOOLS AND RUSH OVER TOWARDS...\nROSCO: They’re coming this way. Quickly, Pendle! Hide!\nROSCO: CROSS TO BESIDE TRANSMITTER.\nCONSTANCE: Now’s our chance! Come on, Asta!\nCONSTANCE: THEY SCRAMBLE OVER TO THE TRANSMITTER.\nCONSTANCE: I’1ll deal with the transmitter, you disable the Dalek casings.\nASTA: Disable? How?\nCONSTANCE: The slaves have got hammers, haven’t they?\nASTA: What about you?\nCONSTANCE: I’1ll just have to go at it with my bare hands. Hurry!!!\nMUTANTS: STILL THRASHING ABOUT, OFF. LIQUID SPLATTERING TO FLOOR.\nDALEK: #2: (OFF) Nutrient supply failing. Dalek survivors must restrain themselves!\nFOLLOW: ASTA AS SHE RUSHES TO CASINGS.\nASTA: (PICKS UP AND HEFTS HAMMER) A hammer, then. So much for craftsmanship. (EFFORT, SWINGS HAMMER)\nSHATTERING: GLASS AS THE CASINGS BREAK APART UNDER THE IMPACT. THE NOISE ALERTS THE OTHER DALEK.\nDALEK: #2: Dalek casings under attack. Human slaves will apprehend intruders. I must stabilise life-support controls. Hurry!\nDALEK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLES IN THE GRIP OF RASPAK’S GUARDS) Raspak, please, listen to me...!\nRASPAK: Hold the Doctor still, my brothers, so I may spear him in the gut!\nTANAPAL: (EFFORT) No, Raspak! Release the Doctor...!\nRASPAK: Your holiness...?\nDOCTOR: Do as your Abbot tells you!\nRASPAK: (CONFUSED) Master?\nTANAPAL: The Doctor is not our enemy. He never has been..! (GASPS)\nRASPAK: Tanapal. What is it?\nBLACK DALEK: (WEAKLY) Symbiotic mental link severed.\nTANAPAL: (PAINED) The creature that was controlling my mind no longer has any influence over me. At last, I am free of it!\nRASPAK: I do not understand.\nTANAPAL: This metal creature. This Dalek. It has brought nothing but death and despair to our Order. It is a demon!\nTANAPAL: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 132\nTANAPAL: 4 x SLAVES SHUFFLING OVER TO ASTA.\nASTA: Constance, the slaves! (TO BROTHERS) Please, brothers. Listen to me. You’re being used. (GRABBED) Ah! — They’ve got me!\nCONSTANCE: Hold on, Asta. (RUSHING OVER) Brothers, sister Asta is correct. Once they’re done with you, the Daleks will destroy you, along with the whole of your brotherhood!\nDALEK: #2: (GLIDING OVER) Human slaves will restrain intruders.\nCONSTANCE: (GRABBED ALSO) Let go, brothers! We mean you no harm!\nDALEK: #2: I will exterminate them. Weapon charging.\nPLASMA: CHARGING UP FX AS BEFORE. CROSS TO:\nPENDLE: It’s going to kill them!\nROSCO: Pull the rest of the tubes out. Quickly!\nDALEK: MUTANTS WRITHING FRANTICALLY.\nPENDLE: (JUDDERED) I can’t get a grip. It’s like the creatures inside\nPENDLE: are trying to break out of these [sacs]\nROSCO: Pendle, look out!\nROSCO: WITH A HORRIBLE WET TEARING SOUND AND SPLASH OF FLUIDS AN OCTOPUS-LIKE DALEK MUTANT RIPS FREE OF ITS SAC AND ATTACKS PENDLE. JABBING, SUCKING SOUNDS.\nPENDLE: Aaah! Get it off me! Aaaaaaaaahhhh!\nPENDLE: HE CONTINUES TO SHRIEK AS WE CROSS TO:\nASTA: Oh no! Pendle!\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 133\nDALEK: #2: Alert! Life support systems compromised. Dalek mutants must be protected!\nGLIDES: OFF.\nASTA: Constance, we’ve got to help Pendle!\nCONSTANCE: There’s nothing we can do.\nASTA: I can’t watch!\nCONSTANCE: Wait... Asta. The novice holding me. He just released his grip.\nASTA: Mine too.\nASTA: THERE IS THE SOUND OF HAMMERS AND METAL BARS BEING PICKED UP\nFROM: AROUND THE WORKSHOP.\nCONSTANCE: They’re picking up tools. Advancing on the Dalek!\nCONSTANCE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 134\nTANAPAL: (COMMUNING WITH MONKS IN DALEK CHAMBER) Hear me, my brothers. Be free. Destroy these demons from another world.\nRASPAK: Abbot Tanapal?\nDOCTOR: He’s communing with the rest of the brotherhood. Urging them to fight back!\nBLACK DALEK: (STIRRING INTO LIFE) New mental link must be established.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. Raspak — quickly! Help me get Tanapal well away from that creature.\nTANAPAL: (EFFORT) I will not allow it to take over my mind again. I will resist!\nDOCTOR: Hear that, Black Dalek? It’s no use. You’re beaten! So much for the futility of resistance.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: (POSSESSED) No... Doctor. Resistance is futile!\nTANAPAL: Brother Raspak?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. It’s in him now...!\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: 4 x SLAVES SHUFFLING TOWARDS DALEK.\nDALEK: #2: Human slaves will obey orders. Restrain those women. Obey! Obey!\nCONSTANCE: Asta, you have to use that transmitter! Call for help.\nASTA: But Assessor Pendle...!\nCONSTANCE: It’s too late for him!\nDALEK: #2: Stay back! Stay back or I will exterminate you!\nPLASMA: BLAST. A NOVICE CRASHES TO THE FLOOR. RECHARGING BEGINS.\nDALEK: #2: Plasma weapon recharging! Stay back! Stay back!\nDALEK: 3 x NOVICES SMASHING AT THE DALEK WITH HAMMERS AND STICKS.\nDALEK: #2: Under attack!

My function is impaired!!!\nDALEK: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 136\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: (JABBING SPEAR) Doctor. I will eviscerate you...!\nDOCTOR: (DODGING SPEAR) Black Dalek — that’s a very primitive weapon.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: But nonetheless effective at close quarters!\nRASPAK: JABS; RIPS THE DOCTOR'S COAT.\nDOCTOR: Ahh! Tanapal — the Black Dalek! You have to destroy it! You have to break the link with Raspak!\nTANAPAL: I have summoned assistance already, Doctor. (CALLING) Come!\nDOORS: BURST OPEN.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: These creatures are unarmed. But I am not!\nDOCTOR: Far from it, Black Dalek. They’ve brought oil lamps!\nTANAPAL: As I decreed. (CALLING) Brothers — the creature behind the curtain is a demon. Purify it! Send it back to the flames!\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: No! No! You must not!\nLAMPS: SHATTER. FLAMES TAKE HOLD. BURNING CURTAIN. BLACK DALEK BEGINS TO BURN.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: (SHRIEKS) Emergency! I am burning! I am meltiiiiiiiiing...!\nTANAPAL: Its body melts, but the creature is in Raspak still!\nDOCTOR: I know. Everybody out, before the whole place goes up!\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 137\nTANAPAL: What about you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: When the creature dies, the link will be broken. Until then, I can’t get Raspak out! Go, go!\nDOCTOR: TANAPAL AND MONKS HURRY OUT.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK: (HUMAN PART — EFFORT) You must leave too, Doctor. Take your companions, and your blue caravan, and leave my world!\nDOCTOR: Raspak? Is that you speaking? I’m not leaving without you.\nRASPAK: /BLACK DALEK:\nRASPAK: (HUMAN PART — EFFORT) The creature hopes to find another vessel still. It hopes to take over you. But I resist it. I will not allow it to leave! So let us burn, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Raspak??\nRASPAK: (SHOVING DOCTOR) Go!!! Let us burn!!! Let us be pure!!!\nDOCTOR: I have to find my friends. Peace be with you, brother Raspak.\nSECRET: PASSAGE DOOR GRINDS OPEN. DOCTOR EXITS AS THE FLAMES\nRISE: EVER HIGHER. FADE.\nRISE: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 138\nRISE: THE SOUND OF THE DALEK HEARTBEAT HAS CEASED.\nCONSTANCE: Try again, Asta. You must get through.\nASTA: Repeat, this is Junior Assessor Asta to Galactic Census control. We are in desperate need of emergency planetary evacuation. A Dalek force has been operating on Strellin. We believe more Daleks to be on the way.\nASTA: CRUNCH OF BROKEN GLASS AS DOCTOR ENTERS THE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke. You’re safe.\nCONSTANCE: (RELIEVED) Doctor. Shh, Asta’s transmitting.\nASTA: Grade two protocols are temporarily revoked. Do you receive, over?\nDOCTOR: I thought the plan was to disable the transmitter?\nCONSTANCE: We were too late. The message reached the Dalek fleet.\nDOCTOR: And Assessor Pend1e...?\nASTA: Dead, Doctor. The Dalek mutants, they...\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nCONSTANCE: Some sort of venom in their bites, we think. Rosco and I managed to dispose of them with the help of the novices. (BEAT) Where is Rosco?\nASTA: He was just here! — Rosco?\nDOCTOR: Rosco!\nCROSS TO: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 139\nCROSS TO: WE CAN HEAR DOCTOR AND THE OTHERS CALLING HIS NAME, BUT ROSCO\nDOES: NOT HEAR THEM.\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) Rosco!\nCONSTANCE: (DISTANT) Rosco, where are you?\nROSCO: (TO HIMSELF) Yes. Yes, I hear you, Master.\nROSCO: Yes, Master — you’re right. I talk too much and never listen.\nROSCO: Yes, Master. If that is your wish...\nHURRIES: AWAY. FADE.\nHURRIES: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 140\nHURRIES: SPLINTERING OF FALLING TIMBERS, AND THE ROAR OF FLAMES AS THE\nWHOLE: MONASTERY BEGINS TO BURN. DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, ASTA RUSH OUT.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Mrs Clarke! The whole place is going up!\nCONSTANCE: I don’t see Rosco. What about Rosco? Where did he go?\nASTA: There’s nothing we can do, Constance. The whole place is ablaze.\nTANAPAL: (COMING OVER) It is nothing but timber and stone. What is important is that our Order will survive.\nDOCTOR: Abbot Tanapal. You’re safe.\nASTA: No-one’s safe! More Daleks could be on their way!\nTANAPAL: Then we will hide from them. They will find nothing of interest here, and they will leave us in peace.\nDOCTOR: I wish I had your confidence, Tanapal. But if the Daleks work out the potential of the Dream Flowers...\nTANAPAL: They will not. Look out onto the mountainside, Doctor. The Monastery is not the only thing ablaze.\nDOCTOR: That’s the valley of the Dream Flowers! Oh, no...!\nCONSTANCE: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: It would seem that Master Boswyck has taken matters into his own hands. Of course, that’s why he insisted on staying behind. He didn’t want to risk the Daleks ever finding the valley. Ostrecallis Mediosai is finally extinct.\nDOCTOR: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 141\nROSCO: It is not, Doctor. Not entirely.\nCONSTANCE: Rosco!\nDOCTOR: (STERN) And where did you go running off to? (GENTLER) Are you all right?\nROSCO: (COUGHING) I had something to fetch, for my master.\nASTA: The plant from Boswyck’s quarters!\nDOCTOR: If the Daleks lean that this one single flower still exists...\nROSCO: (FIRM) They will not. This will be our sacred duty now, to guard this one flower with our lives. Until our world once again knows peace.\nTANAPAL: It would seem that the apprentice has become the Master. Doctor, my brothers and I must depart, in search of some other place to establish our new Order.\nDOCTOR: I wish you luck. All of you.\nDOCTOR: TANAPAL AND ROSCO HEAD OFF INTO THE NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: Come along, Mrs Clarke. (WALKING OVER TO TARDIS) The TARDIS is untouched by the flames, but not for much longer.\nCONSTANCE: (FOLLOWS HIM) What about you, Asta? Can we take you back home?\nASTA: I have to wait for the rescue ship. There’ll be a big clean-up operation, and the exclusion zone around this planet will have to be extended, and reinforced. Just to make sure the Daleks don’t dare return. This is a world of innocence and beauty, and I’1ll do my utmost to see it remains so.\nASTA: ORDER OF THE DALEKS by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: I have a feeling that you just passed your final test, Assessor Asta. (PUSHING TARDIS DOOR) Come along, Mrs Clarke.\nTARDIS: DOOR SLAMS. DEMATERIALISATION BEGINS.\nTARDIS: THE END"
