He called you ‘boss’ back there.\nSTUART: Yeah. I mean, I picked up the yard for absolute peanuts —\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 14\nMEL: Last time I saw you, you didn’t have enough peanuts to buy a shipyard.\nSTUART: I made a bit of money off this steel process I patented — look, we keep a piece of it mounted on the wall, there.\nMEL: That’s steel?\nSTUART: Yeah, the process gives it that almost blueish dark gunmetal colour — we call it Dark Alloy.\nMEL: What else is good about it?\nSTUART: Strength, durability in extreme heat — it’s thinner and lighter without compromising those things.\nMEL: Did you come up with that all on your own?\nSTUART: Er, yes.

You need to get with the program! (LAUGHS AT OWN JOKE)\nSTUART: Yes, I know — I meant to, but we were stretched for money and time. But I’m dragging us into the Nineties. 3D modelling has improved so much —\nMEL: Not just your design work — you should be doing your stock- keeping, book-keeping, payroll, client [records —]\nSTUART: Absolutely — and I need someone to manage those systems for me. And it seems like you don’t have a job, so...\nMEL: (TAKEN ABACK) Oh.\nSTUART: Is that a good ‘oh’?\nMEL: It’s a surprised ‘oh’.\nSTUART: You don’t have to say ‘yes’ now. But it’d be great to work with you, so if you could think about it?\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 19\nLEE: Sorry for interrupting, boss. We’ve got a situation downstairs.\nLEE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 20\nLEE: SCENE 10. INT. SHIPYARD (BREAK ROOM)\nDOCTOR: I did not lay a finger on the body! I was [merely —]\nLEE: His friend told us someone tried to kill her, then we went ona wild goose chase while he was messing about with the body.\nDOCTOR: I was carefully examining him.\nMEL: Doctor, for heaven’s sake —\nSTUART: And you thought that was your job, not the police’s?\nDOCTOR: You’ve seen the body? The black sticky substance around his mouth?\nMEL: Looks like squid ink.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it didn’t come from a squid, so where do you think it [did —]\nSTUART: (FLUSTERED) None of this is any of your business.\nLEE: Boss, I reckon we should keep them apart until the rozzers get here. Dunno what’s keeping them.\nDOCTOR: If I killed this man, don’t you think I’d be trying to get away?\nSTUART: How well do you know these people, Melanie?\nMEL: I can vouch for him. (TO DOCTOR) Where’s Ace?\nLEE: In my office. Vinny’s with her.\nLEE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 21\nLEE: SCENE 11. INT. SHIPYARD (FLOOR OFFICE)\nACE: This is ridiculous. Whoever did it could be miles away by now.\nVINNY: They could, yeah.\nACE: I mean, they wouldn’t have hung around!\nVINNY: Maybe. Maybe not.\nACE: Did you know him? The man who died?\nVINNY: Everyone knows everyone here. He was a good lad, Joel.\nACE: I’m sorry.\nVINNY: So am I.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 22\nVINNY: SCENE 12. INT. SHIPYARD\nMEL: What did you think you were doing?\nDOCTOR: What I always do.\nMEL: I suppose. It feels rather different when it happens in front of someone you know.\nDOCTOR: You seem to know him well.\nMEL: He was my boyfriend for two years — more than two. He was studying Engineering, after graduation he was offered a job in the Middle East and I was happy where I was, So...\nDOCTOR: Long distance relationships are awkward.\nMEL: He’s just offered me a job here.\nDOCTOR: Oh. And what did you say?\nMEL: Stuart?\nSTUART: (A LITTLE CONFUSED) Did you say something, Melanie?\nMEL: I’ve had a chance to think it over, and — Your nose is bleeding.\nSTUART: Is it?\nMEL: Here, take a tissue — (AS HE DOES) Are you all right?\nSTUART: It’s nothing. I’ve got a headache. What were you saying?\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 23\nMEL: I’1ll take the job.\nDOCTOR: Mel, you can’t [be —]\nSTUART: Oh wow. That’s amazing.\nMEL: I can’t wait to get started.\nSTUART: I’ve actually just heard our client is dropping by.\nMEL: That’s not ideal timing, what with [the —]\nSTUART: The fatality, yes, but she’s not someone you can say no to. You can meet her — she’1l be here any minute.\nMEL: I’m sorry, Doctor —\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to apologise.\nMEL: It was just now — realising the offer might get taken away — it made me realise, I do want it. It’s such a good job for me.\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to explain.\nSTUART: (OFF) Melanie! I said we’d see her up in the meeting room.\nMEL: OK — Doctor? I’1l catch up with you before you go?\nDOCTOR: Of course. (TO HIMSELF) Assuming we’re allowed to leave.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: SCENE 13. INT. SHIPYARD (OFFICE)\nACE: So what do you do here?\nVINNY: Welding. You don’t have to pretend to be interested.\nACE: You use like a blowtorch?\nVINNY: Let’s talk about you. Not from round here, are you?\nACE: No, I travel around.\nVINNY: So how come you’re poking around a ship?\nACE: I wasn’t poking around. I was just here — The Doctor dragged me here.\nVINNY: And why’s he poking around a.. What? What’re you looking at?\nACE: (NERVOUS SUDDENLY) Your hands.\nVINNY: Gah, thought I fixed this stupid glitchy piece [of —]\nACE: You’re not human.\nVINNY: Very observant.\nACE: Did you kill that man?\nVINNY: Oh that’s nice. Assume the alien did it.\nACE: Did you?\nVINNY: (BEAT) Yeah.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 25\nACE: OK — I’m sure you were scared, and you just lashed out —\nVINNY: No, wasn’t like that at all. I’ve got a very, very important job to do and I can’t let anyone get in the way, so —\nACE: You’re gonna kill me too.\nVINNY: No. I’m taking you with me.\nACE: Where?\nVINNY: Home.\nVINNY: Don’t even think about making a move for the door.\nACE: I wasn’t. Cos If I did, you’d stop me easy, right?\nVINNY: I would.\nACE: That’s why I was planning on hitting you with the paperweight List\nVINNY: What?\nVINNY: (HIT ON HEAD) Argh!\nACE: See ya! (RUNS OUT)\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 26\nACE: SCENE 14. INT. SHIPYARD\nACE: (OFF) Hey! Hey!\nLEE: What?\nACE: (OFF) It’s that bloke Vinny!\nDOCTOR: What about him?\nACE: (OFF) He’s the killer — he was going to kill me but —\nLEE: I can’t believe you’re trying to pull this again.\nACE: Alright, I lied before — but it’s true this time! He hasn’t followed me so he must be trying to get away —\nDOCTOR: Show me.\nACE: This way.\nLEE: Hey — hey! You can’t go anywhere till you’ve talked to the rozzers!\nLEE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 27\nLEE: SCENE 15. INT. SHIPYARD (MEETING ROOM)\nSTUART: I wish I’d had time to tidy up.\nMEL: You should’ve told her you couldn’t see her today.\nCAROLYN: It’s rather late for that, I’m here now.\nSTUART: Carolyn. Hello.\nCAROLYN: I gather one of the workers has died? How sad.\nSTUART: The police should be here soon. In fact, I’m surprised [they —]\nCAROLYN: I’m sure they’1ll sort it out. Who’s this?\nMEL: Melanie Bush. Lovely to meet you.\nSTUART: This is Carolyn Evans. (TO CAROLYN) I’ve just offered Melanie a job, and she’s said yes.\nCAROLYN: Oh good, I’ve been telling you you need a secretary.\nMEL: No, not a secretary.\nSTUART: Much more exciting than that.\nCAROLYN: Do tell.\nSTUART: Come with us — we’1ll show you!\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 28\nSTUART: SCENE 16. INT. SHIPYARD (CORRIDOR)\nRUN: DOWN IT.\nACE: He’s an alien.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nACE: You know?\nDOCTOR: Well, I knew the murderer was an alien. The residue on his face had a chemical structure that [was —]\nACE: Where now?\nDOCTOR: You go this way, I’1l go —\nDOCTOR: DOOR AND ESCAPES.\nACE: That way! There he is!\nDOCTOR: He’s going outside! After him!\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: SCENE 17. EXT. SHIPYARD (CONTINUOUS)\nOUTER: EDGE. CLANGING FOOTSTEPS. BELOW IT IS WATER. THE GANTRY IS RUSTY AND HASN’T BEEN USED IN YEARS: IT CREAKS WHENEVER THEY MOVE. VINNY GRABS THE DOCTOR AS THEY RUN OUT AND HOLDS HIM.\nVINNY: Gotcha.\nDOCTOR: Urk!\nACE: Let him go.\nVINNY: No way.\nACE: Even if you get past me, look — this walkway doesn’t go anywhere. Unless you want to go for a dip in the Mersey.\nDOCTOR: She’s right — let’s go back inside and talk about [this —]\nVINNY: No — I’m taking one of you with me and I don’t care who. I want to know who sent you.\nDOCTOR: We came of our own accord.\nVINNY: You can’t fool me. You’re not from Earth and I’m not sure about her either.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we can help [you —]\nACE: We need to get off this thing — it can’t take the weight.\nVINNY: I’m not going back through there.\nACE: Then we’re all going in the river! Don’t be daft —\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nACE: Woah —\nDOCTOR: Ace, get back inside —\nDOCTOR: /ACE: /VINNY:\nDOCTOR: Page 30\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18. INT. SHIPYARD\nLEE: Has anyone seen Vinny? Don? You seen him? He was in my office, [but —]\nLEE: OFFICER AND HAS TWO ASSOCIATES WITH HIM, DOING THE SAME.\nDANUTA: (OFF) Looking for Mr Clayton. Lee Clayton?\nLEE: That’s me.\nDANUTA: Detective Inspector Marsden. Has anyone left the building since it happened?\nDANUTA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 32\nDANUTA: SCENE 19. INT. SHIPYARD (IT CENTRE)\nSTUART: We’re going to be so much more efficient with this, our designs will be more rigorously tested, and with Melanie on board —\nMEL: Our aim will be to cut your costs, and deliver what you want that much quicker.\nCAROLYN: Right. (BEAT) No.\nSTUART: I’m... not sure what you mean.\nCAROLYN: I was clear that I don’t want this done using computers and you will strip them out immediately.\nMEL: What on Earth was that [about —]\nSTUART: Carolyn — wait!\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 33\nSTUART: SCENE 20. INT. CAR\nBUNDLES: SODDEN ACE INSIDE.\nVINNY: Hold still.\nACE: What happened?\nVINNY: We fell in the water. I pulled you out.\nACE: Why?\nACE: Ow!\nVINNY: Have I tied your hands too tight?\nACE: Yes.\nVINNY: Good.\nACE: Where’s the Doctor?\nVINNY: I couldn’t get both of you out. I went with you cos that jacket makes you float more.\nACE: We’ve got to go back — get him out of there!\nVINNY: No, you have to shut up and I have to get to a place just outside town.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 34\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 35\nVINNY: SCENE 21. EXT. SHIPYARD\nAROUND: OUTSIDE.\nDANUTA: How many ways in and out of this place are there?\nLEE: Yard doors were bolted, there’s a workers’ entrance and an office entrance, so the only other [way —]\nDANUTA: What’s that in the water?\nLEE: That’s one of them!\nLEE: He’s not moving. I think he’s —\nDOCTOR: (OFF; SUDDENLY SURFACING, CALLING OUT) Good day, gentlemen. I don’t suppose you could help me out of here?\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22. INT. SHIPYARD (MEETING ROOM)\nCAROLYN: Stuart, we have other matters to talk about [and —]\nSTUART: But Carolyn, I’ve spent a huge amount of money on all [this —]\nCAROLYN: Then you should have consulted with me first.\nMEL: Why is this such an issue for you?\nCAROLYN: If you install computers, I believe the quality of the work will go down.\nMEL: That’s not true.\nSTUART: We have to modernise to keep up with our rivals, Carolyn — and Mel is the perfect person to do that, she’s a terrific talent.\nCAROLYN: Your rivals are irrelevant — if you keep up the quality of work you’ve done so far, you can expect more contracts from us.\nMEL: You can’t fight progress — it’s already changed the world and it’s going to change it a lot more.\nSTUART: I don’t understand what you’re so afraid of.\nCAROLYN: (FROSTY) I’m not afraid, Stuart.\nSTUART: Well — figure of speech, but you know [what I —]\nCAROLYN: All right. You’ve convinced me.\nMEL: Really?\nCAROLYN: In fact, I think we should toast this new appointment —\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 37\nMEL: You.. have a bottle of champagne in your bag?\nCAROLYN: Do you have glasses, Stuart?\nSTUART: Um... I can get some cups from the drinks machine.\nCAROLYN: Perfect. Hold that, please.\nMEL: Oh, it’s cold.\nSTUART: Thank you for being reasonable about this.\nCAROLYN: I’m always reasonable. Now —\nCAROLYN: Melanie, may your talent turn to our true purpose.\nMEL: (BEAT) Er. OK.\nSTUART: Cheers.\nMEL: Chink!\nCAROLYN: Why did you say that?\nMEL: If we had glasses they’d ‘chink’ when you put them together, but the cups don’t, so I’m saying chink.\nCAROLYN: How charming. Drink up.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 38\nCAROLYN: SCENE 23. INT. CAR\nACE: Nice part of town.\nVINNY: All been abandoned for years. That’s why I parked here.\nACE: What, your spaceship’s out here? Camouflaged?\nVINNY: Yep. And all we have to do to make it visible —\nVINNY: Hang on...\nACE: Problem?\nVINNY: It should be there. What have you done with it?\nACE: Me?\nVINNY: Tell me where it’s gone!\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 39\nVINNY: SCENE 24. INT. SHIPYARD\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDANUTA: So this man doesn’t work here?\nLEE: No. (TO DOCTOR) I warned you about leaving the building. You’re in [serious —]\nDANUTA: I’1ll handle this. (TO DOCTOR) Sir, I need to ask you some questions [about —]\nDOCTOR: Actually you don’t. Officer, the man you’re looking for works here. The man who Mr Clayton told to watch over my friend Ace.\nLEE: Vinny?\nDOCTOR: A surname might also be helpful.\nLEE: Gillespie.\nDOCTOR: There you go. As I was trying to swim to shore, I saw him pull my friend Ace out of the water and carry her away. I suspect he wants to use her as a hostage.\nDANUTA: So I’m meant to just go along with your version of this?\nDOCTOR: Whether you do or not, Ace is with Vinny, and if I was the killer, Ace is my accomplice — so you need to find them anyway and the longer you delay here, the less likely that is.\nDANUTA: Constables — with me. Mr Clayton — keep everyone here until we get back. (DANUTA & COPPERS EXIT)\nLEE: How did you get him [to —]\nDOCTOR: Tell me everything you know about Vinny Gillespie.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR: SCENE 25. EXT. ORLA’S HOUSE\nACE: Whose house is this?\nVINNY: Someone who might be able to help me. Shut up and don’t make trouble. I don’t need you alive that badly.\nACE: I hope they’ve got some dry clothes.\nVINNY: (BEAT) Actually yeah, she may do.\nORLA: Vinny?\nVINNY: Orla, we need to come in.\nORLA: Who’s this?\nACE: Ace. Pleased to meet you.\nORLA: Has something happened at work?\nACE: You could say that.\nVINNY: We’re coming in.\nORLA: Hey!\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 41\nORLA: SCENE 26. INT. SHIPYARD\nLEE: Look, Vinny only started about three months back, but he fitted right in.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure that was the idea.\nLEE: What d’you mean?\nMEL: (ARRIVING) Sorry, am I interrupting something?\nDOCTOR: Mel. I’m glad you’re here.\nMEL: Where’s Ace?\nDOCTOR: Kidnapped.\nMEL: Why didn’t you come straight up and tell me?\nDOCTOR: I thought you were probably busy.\nMEL: Not too busy to worry about Ace!\nDOCTOR: Good, because I think we can help. To the TARDIS.\nMEL: Right.\nLEE: The police said not to leave the yard!\nDOCTOR: (OFF) We won't!\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR: SCENE 27. INT. SHIPYARD (MEETING ROOM)\nSTUART: I don’t know what your schedule’s like —\nCAROLYN: Tight.\nSTUART: But maybe I could make some reservations for dinner tonight for you, me and Melanie, and [we —]\nCAROLYN: That won’t be necessary.\nSTUART: I think it might be useful if we’re to —\nCAROLYN: No no, Stuart, it really won’t be necessary.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 43\nCAROLYN: SCENE 28. INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: As we landed, I detected an alien energy trace.\nMEL: You didn’t say anything.\nDOCTOR: A blip — it could easily have been nothing. There are aliens all over Earth. Most of them are just going about their business, unnoticed by anyone.\nMEL: Except that one of them’s a murderer.\nDOCTOR: Mel — watch that readout.\nMEL: What am I looking for?\nDOCTOR: It might tell us where our friend is now or, potentially, where his — Why’s it making that noise?\nMEL: Doctor — I can’t move my hands.\nDOCTOR: Can’t move them?\nMEL: They’re stuck to the controls.\nDOCTOR: Like glue?\nMEL: No, a force — more like a strong magnet.\nDOCTOR: Mel — get away from the console.\nMEL: I can’t.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: It’s going to overload!\nMEL: There’s nothing I can do!\nMEL: Page 44\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 45"

Who?\nACE: Joel?\nORLA: What?!\nVINNY: I didn’t have a choice — listen —\nORLA: And what, you think going through the gate’s the answer? Run off to another world?\nACE: Another world — what is this gate?\nVINNY: It’s at the back of the shipyard, they use it to receive materials. (TO ORLA) And I’m not just running away.\nORLA: They don’t let people go to their place, Vinny.\nVINNY: I’m not going to their place.\nACE: You think this gate could take you back to your own planet?\nORLA: His own planet?\nACE: He’s an alien.\nORLA: Oh my —\nACE: That is the plan, isn’t it?\nVINNY: Yes.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 48\nACE: So what do you need me for?\nVINNY: You’re coming with me.\nACE: Why?\nVINNY: You and that Doctor fella — you’re counter-agents, aren’t you?\nORLA: Counter-agents?\nACE: I get it — he’s a spy. And what, you think Earth’s going to attack you?\nVINNY: You know it’s bigger than that — who sent you?\nACE: Nobody sent us — you’re barking up the wrong tree, mate.\nVINNY: We’ve got people back home who can get every last secret out of you — (TO ORLA) And you are going to send us there.\nORLA: I can’t do that, Vinny — I literally can’t —\nVINNY: You can and you’re going to. We just need to wait for the yard to close up for the day.\nORLA: I can’t take this in — you’re an alien and a killer and now you’re kidnapping women? I thought you were alright, [and —]\nVINNY: Don’t take the high ground with me after what you’ve been doing.\nACE: What does he mean?\nORLA: I’ve no idea.\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 49\nVINNY: Everyone knows that place isn’t right. You more than anyone — you take these deliveries through the gate, it all arrives like magic. But there’s gonna be a price, you know.\nORLA: We're just building a ship.\nVINNY: But you don’t know who for.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 50\nVINNY: SCENE 31. INT. TARDIS SICKBAY\nMEL: Mmmmuh.\nDOCTOR: It’s OK, Mel, no rush...\nMEL: Where am I?\nDOCTOR: In the TARDIS sickbay.\nMEL: Why’s it so dark?\nDOCTOR: I had to cut all power. Fortunately I keep a good supply of candles.\nMEL: (SUDDENLY REMEMBERING) The console exploded!\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes — don’t worry.\nMEL: What happened? Why did it do that?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I’ve booted up the repair system, but its diagnosis was incomprehensible. The TARDIS should be able to repair itself, nonetheless. She’s a sturdy old girl.\nMEL: Did you find the energy trace?\nDOCTOR: No. So we can either try to sneak out of the shipyard and look for Ace ourselves...\nMEL: Or?\nDOCTOR: Or we can let the police look for Ace, and while they’re distracted, I can finally look at the scene of the murder.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: SCENE 32. INT. ORLA’S HOUSE\nVINNY: Turn that TV off, Orla.\nORLA: I’m checking the local news, Vinny, the police might have put\nORLA: out an alert for you.\nVINNY: Well turn it down then.\nACE: I’1l do it.\nACE: Has this got Teletext?\nORLA: Yeah.\nACE: Three... oh... two.\nVINNY: Orla — come here.\nORLA: What is it?\nVINNY: Whose car’s that?\nACE: (TO SELF) Gordon Bennett — Charlton are playing Tranmere tonight.\nORLA: (TO VINNY) I don’t recognise it.\nVINNY: We can’t get to my car, it’s out front.\nORLA: They’1l have tracked it.\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 52\nACE: Typical — just down the road from a Charlton game and I can’t go cos I’ve been kidnapped by a psycho alien.\nVINNY: In the kitchen.\nACE: Why?\nVINNY: Orla — you go to the door, tell them we were here but we’ve left.\nORLA: And what if they don’t believe me?\nVINNY: I’1ll deal with them. (TO ACE) Move it.\nVINNY: RINGS.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 53\nVINNY: SCENE 33. INT.

This should pick up things the local police don’t even\nDOCTOR: know to look for...\nMEL: Can I help?\nDOCTOR: Yes — could you turn off that arcade machine please?\nMEL: All right —\nMEL: Ow!\nDOCTOR: What happened?\nSOUND: EFFECTS PLAYING ALL AT THE SAME TIME.\nMEL: I only touched it for a second and —\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: Mel — get down!\nMEL: Where?\nDOCTOR: Behind my umbrella!\nDOCTOR: THE SCREEN FLYING OUTWARD. THE PIECES FALL TO THE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: Mel? Are you all right?\nMEL: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Good.

Can I help, officers?\nDANUTA: My colleague and I are looking for a man you work with, name of Vincent Gillespie.\nORLA: I don’t know where he is.\nDANUTA: His car’s outside.\nORLA: He was here, but he’s gone.\nDANUTA: Constable — go round the back. Make sure no-one tries to get out.\nORLA: They’re not here, really.\nDANUTA: ‘They’?\nORLA: I, er — oh.\nDANUTA: I’m stepping this up. (CLEARS THROAT) Ilsin teidrepmi assam sullet..

ORLA’S HOUSE (KITCHEN)\nACE: Is that an earthquake?\nVINNY: No. They’re trying to flush us out.\nBRICKS: COMING APART.\nACE: The whole house is coming apart!\nVINNY: Looks like we don’t have a choice. Come on —\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 57\nVINNY: SCENE 36. EXT. STREET\nORLA: You’re not a policeman — how are you doing that?\nDANUTA: You’d never understand.\nORLA: You're taking my house apart — stop! Stop it!\nVINNY: Do as she says.\nDANUTA: There you are. Ile sulecai e —\nVINNY: Oh no you don’t.\nDANUTA: (THOUGH STILL BROKEN).\nACE: There’s no need to kill him!\nVINNY: Go to the car, you two.\nORLA: But my house...\nACE: Come on!\nDANUTA: Ile sulecai e rutibaruc —\nVINNY: That won’t work, fella.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 58\nDANUTA: There are more of us coming.

INT. SHIPYARD (IT CENTRE)\nLEE: Where d’you want this one, boss?\nSTUART: On the desk by that wall, I think, Lee. You take the monitor, I'll take the main unit.\nSTUART: Thanks for helping with this.\nLEE: Well, we’re stuck here until the police say we can go.\nSTUART: I’m surprised they haven’t sent anyone else to do the interviews — Could you plug that into the monitor?\nLEE: Sure.\nSTUART: Good — let’s test this thing then.\nBURST: IN.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Don’t turn on that computer!\nSTUART: What?\nLEE: I’ve had enough of you two. I’m getting the police.\nMEL: It’s true — there’s something strange going on —\nLEE: (OFF) You’re not wrong.\nLEE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 61\nMEL: Stuart, we’re serious. You have to turn them off. Let me —\nSTUART: Hey!\nCOMPUTER: GOES HAYWIRE, MAKING RAPID PROCESSING NOISES.

CAR\nVINNY: The people you work for have mastered a kind of control over matter no other civilisation has achieved.\nORLA: They took my house apart — brick by brick —\nVINNY: Just a party trick. They conquered half a galaxy. Took thousands of years for all those worlds to liberate themselves and we won’t let it happen again.\nACE: Who are they?\nVINNY: The Eorgem. Old, old civilisation, geared towards war. They got beaten back and agreed to a peace treaty — but the Coalition still checks they’re not making plans to kick off again.\nACE: So that’s why you’re here?\nVINNY: We got a lead about activity here, I got sent to gather evidence.\nACE: If I was one of them, don’t you think I’d have used whatever freaky juju took her house apart?\nVINNY: I know you’re not one of them. If you were, you’d have been affected by my disguise.\nORLA: Disguise?\nVINNY: I don’t really look like this. I use digital holographic projection. The Eorgem don’t react well to digital technology — it disrupts their own when they get up close. That’s why they try not to let you get up close.\nACE: OK, so why [do —]\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 63\nVINNY: They use agents from other species. They’re not meant to leave their own system under the treaty terms.\nORLA: We’re here.\nORLA: There’s still lights on all over the yard.\nVINNY: Why hasn’t everyone gone home?\nACE: Probably aren’t allowed until the police have talked to them all.\nVINNY: Can’t afford to wait any longer. They’1l find me —\nVINNY: We’ll go in the back way.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 64\nVINNY: SCENE 40. INT. SHIPYARD (IT CENTRE)\nSTUART: Don’t touch those computers.\nDOCTOR: Very good advice. We also need to unplug all of them. Immediately.\nSTUART: What’s going on? Melanie?\nMEL: I don’t understand either.\nDOCTOR: Stuart, are any of these connected to the internet?\nSTUART: No no, I’ve considered it but —\nDOCTOR: Good. Mel — you have to stay here until we work out what’s wrong with you.\nSTUART: Doctor, I appreciate there are things happening I don’t understand, but you’re not in charge here, [and]\nSTUART: What’s that noise?\nMEL: I think it’s coming from your watch.\nSTUART: What?\nDOCTOR: Take it off! Quick —\nSTUART: Argh!\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: Are you alright?\nSTUART: It’s burnt my wrist.\nDOCTOR: Was that a digital watch?\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: SCENE 41. INT. SHIPYARD (CORRIDOR)\nORLA: I think they set the alarms down here after 6:30.\nVINNY: I've dealt with the alarms, Orla.\nACE: Have you checked the cleaners won’t be coming round too, Vinny? Be so annoying to get caught by a cleaner.\nVINNY: Shut up and take us to the gate.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 67\nVINNY: SCENE 42. INT. SHIPYARD (IT CENTRE)\nDOCTOR: This is very, very bad.\nMEL: I’d gathered that from the way things keep exploding.\nDOCTOR: Not just things, Mel. Digital technology. Microchips.\nSTUART: What else has this happened to?\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS, and the arcade machine in the break room.\nMEL: But why, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid it’s you, Mel.\nMEL: Me?\nDOCTOR: You touched the console, the arcade machine and the computer.\nMEL: I didn’t touch his watch!\nDOCTOR: I think it may be infectious.\nLEE: A virus that makes computers explode?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Not a naturally occurring one, of course — that would be absurd.\nSTUART: Obviously.\nDOCTOR: I think someone has manufactured this and infected Mel with it deliberately.\nMEL: (BEAT) That woman.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 68\nMEL: SCENE 43.

Those are smaller sheets — they’re for sealing.\nVINNY: Eorgem technology. (TO ORLA) OK, the target co-ordinates are\nVINNY: galactic seven two [eight —]\nORLA: I can’t program this thing with co-ordinates.\nVINNY: But you’re the operator. You had training.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 69\nORLA: I know how to turn it on, I know how to switch between four different locations using these controls — that’s it.\nACE: Controls? It looks like a bunch of stones in a birdbath.\nORLA: Yep. You control it by moving the stones — but they have to stay under the waterline.\nVINNY: Right. I can work this out.\nACE: So you’ve locked yourself in a room with a machine you don’t know how to use.\nVINNY: I’1l work it out!\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 70\nVINNY: SCENE 44. INT.

So please don’t act confused.\nSTUART: I’m not acting, [I —]\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 71\nMEL: Stuart, tell us. We want to help.\nSTUART: Look — when they closed this shipyard down, they left this town to rot. No jobs, no hope, no future. I bought up the old yard and made it what it is now.\nDOCTOR: Very impressive. But I think you should have looked this particular gift horse in the mouth [before you —]\nLEE: Boss? I just went by the stock room and it’s locked.\nSTUART: It should be, this time of night.\nLEE: Locked from the inside and someone’s barricaded the door.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nLEE: Don’t know, but there’s someone in there. I’m going down.\nDOCTOR: I’m coming with you.\nLEE: No you’re not.\nSTUART: Lee, just let him help. I’11l come too.\nMEL: And me.\nDOCTOR: No! You two stay here — we need to make sure this doesn’t spread.\nSTUART: You’re probably infected too.\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. My constitution is a little different to\nDOCTOR: yours.\nSTUART: What did he mean by that?\nMEL: What do you think he meant?\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 73\nMEL: SCENE 45. INT. SHIPYARD (SUPPLY ROOM)\nACE: Admit it, Vinny, you haven’t got a clue.\nVINNY: I’m getting the hang of it.\nORLA: You think?\nACE: Give yourself up, mate.\nVINNY: Give myself up? You know what’1l happen when your ‘client’ finds out there was a spy in this place? They [won’t —]\nORLA: Vinny...? What’s happening to your skin?\nACE: That disguise of yours is slipping again.\nVINNY: Gah. Might as well get shot of it, mightn’t I —\nACE: That’s your hologram generator thing?\nVINNY: Yep, why?\nACE: I just didn’t expect it to be fixed on with velcro.\nGARGLY: NOW.\nVINNY: (GARGLY) That’s better.\nORLA: Is it?\nVINNY: (GARGLY) I haven’t even dared take it off at night.\nVINNY: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 74\nLEE: (OFF) Who’s in there?\nVINNY: (GARGLY; LOW) Get him to go away.\nORLA: (CALLS) It’s just me, Lee.\nLEE: (OFF) Orla? I didn’t think you were at work today?\nORLA: (CALLS) I... left something important here.\nLEE: (OFF) Why’ve you locked the door?\nORLA: (CALLS) I must’ve done it accidentally.

Nobody move and — What’s happened here?\nACE: You took your time.\nORLA: She grabbed Vinny’s sleeve, spun him round and flung him into the gate.\nLEE: So where is he now?\nORLA: No idea. He messed with the controls.\nDOCTOR: And your name is?\nORLA: Orla.\nDOCTOR: Lovely name. I’m the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 79\nACE: I’m fine thanks, by the way.\nDOCTOR: Of course you are. So this is the energy trace I picked up in the TARDIS.\nLEE: It’s a gateway.\nDOCTOR: Obviously. This is where all your materials come through, I assume.\nACE: Orla — if Vinny messed up the controls — does that mean you can’t bring him back?\nORLA: Do you want me to?\nACE: Not exactly, but — did I kill him?\nLEE: It was you or him, love.\nACE: I suppose, but —\nDOCTOR: I’m sure there was no alternative, Ace. But I’m glad you’re sorry it happened. I’d be a lot more worried if you weren’t. Did you find out much about him?\nACE: He was a spy. And oh, there’s some bad stuff going down with the people they’re building this ship for —\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nACE: Can we get out of this room?\nLEE: I’m going to fix the lock on that door.\nDOCTOR: A very good idea, Lee. Meanwhile we’ll get a cup of tea and Orla will explain to us how this paraphernalia ended up ina shipping yard on Merseyside in 1991.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 80\nORLA: Will I?\nDOCTOR: Yes, you will.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: SCENE 49.

The company promised me stuff they didn’t deliver, then went bust owing me three months’ salary. I had no job and a lot of debt.\nMEL: Poor you.\nSTUART: That was when Carolyn came to me with the dark alloy method.\nMEL: You didn’t think to ask why she was so willing to give it away to you?\nSTUART: Of course I did. But she wouldn’t say, [and —]\nMEL: And that didn’t ring any alarm bells?\nSTUART: I had nothing, I was nearly bankrupt — you can’t tell me you'd have turned this down?\nMEL: I might have wondered what the price would be.\nSTUART: I made money off selling the stuff — only I could actually make the process work, but I pretended it was a corporate secret. I used it to buy this place — it was easy, there were old debts, they were desperate for me to take it off their hands.\nMEL: And she told you to do that?\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 82\nSTUART: Yes — but that was the best bit, it’s brought jobs back. They need this place so badly here — ask anyone, they’re all glad I came.\nMEL: I hope for your sake they stay glad.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 83\nMEL: SCENE 50. INT. SHIPYARD (OFFICE)\nDOCTOR: . and two sugars, just a splash.\nACE: Call that just a splash?\nDOCTOR: Now, Orla. I’m sure this is a fascinating story.\nORLA: I don’t know everything. I mean — I wouldn’t believe half of it if I’d not seen it.\nACE: I take it you’re not an alien, then.\nORLA: No no. When I applied for the job, it was advertised as a logistics role. Tracking the stock and putting in orders.\nACE: And it’s not.\nORLA: Well it is. But the parts and materials arrive through the gate.\nACE: But you still took the job.\nORLA: I’d been out of work a year and a half — of course I took the job.\nDOCTOR: What did they tell you about it? Where it came from?\nORLA: Not a lot. I mean, I guessed it was... I mean, it was...\nDOCTOR: Alien.\nORLA: Yeah, or something.\nDOCTOR: It is alien.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 84\nACE: (SLURPING TEA) Urgh, this is rank!\nDOCTOR: Ssh! (TO ORLA) What about the client? Stuart’s business partner?\nORLA: Her? I’ve not spoken to her much, but she’s a weird one.\nDOCTOR: Did she show you how to use the gate?\nORLA: No, this other bloke came in to explain that. He was right patronising.\nDOCTOR: I can imagine.\nORLA: He showed me four positions and said never to do anything else with it or there’d be hell to pay.\nDOCTOR: He used those exact words?\nORLA: I can’t remember. I don’t think so. He talked a bit weird. Not foreign, but loud.\nDOCTOR: But the positions are so precise — he didn’t give you a cheat sheet or anything?\nORLA: No, he — ugh, this is weird.\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nORLA: He had this thing like a candle, but when he lit it, it burned really fast and it had this sort of metallic smell. It made me feel a bit dizzy — but after that, I just knew where the stones needed to go.\nDOCTOR: Interesting.\nORLA: I’m glad you think so.\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR: I’d like to see some of these materials, please. Not alloy — everything.\nORLA: The corridor back there’s got storage bays all along\nDOCTOR: Good.\nORLA: Wait, I’ve not drunk my tea.\nACE: Milk’s off.

They’ve learned new skills — it’s very much to their benefit.\nMEL: And what are they supposed to do with these ‘skills’? Clearly nobody outside this yard knows what you’re doing here. So they have no choice but to work for you.\nSTUART: That was true long before I got here! You said you’ve been travelling — a lot’s changed. People are asset-stripping this country — they’re selling everything off. The jobs are going, ordinary people getting thrown on the scrapheap.

(CALLING) Back to work, everyone!\nCAROLYN: BEFORE.\nCAROLYN: The downside, of course, is that prolonged use makes the body break down, otherwise I’d have cast it long ago.\nLEE: What?\nCAROLYN: Now: let us continue with our tour.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 98\nCAROLYN: SCENE 56. INT. SHIPYARD (BREAK ROOM)\nDOCTOR: Your clients have arrived, Stuart.\nSTUART: Yes, they called ahead.\nMEL: Stuart’s nose has only just stopped bleeding.\nDOCTOR: Tell me everything you know about them.\nSTUART: It’s not much.\nDOCTOR: Then it won’t take long.\nSTUART: They call themselves the Eorgem. They seem a very regimented society, judging from the ones I’ve met so far.\nDOCTOR: Which is how many?\nSTUART: Only about five or six. I mostly talk to Carolyn.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think her name is Carolyn. Although you do get names coincidentally recurring in different civilisations. I once met a Sontaran called Harold.\nSTUART: They have.. I don’t like to say ‘powers’, but... their technology isn’t anything we’d recognise as technology.\nDOCTOR: Anything else?\nSTUART: That’s it, really.\nMEL: Doctor, is Ace all right?\nDOCTOR: Mm? Oh yes, Ace is fine. Now, the ship isn’t yet ready to fly —\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 99\nMEL: & STUART: Fly?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Stuart’s been building them a spaceship.\nSTUART: Have we?\nDOCTOR: Didn’t you know? Congratulations. The largest spaceship ever built by British industry.\nMEL: But it looks like a... you know, sea-ship.\nDOCTOR: In space the shape of the vehicle is irrelevant. Maybe they just like how it looks.\nSTUART: But it can’t fly. It can’t —\nDOCTOR: I had a look at some of the components they supplied to you. I assure you, it can.\nSTUART: But... I [don’t —]\nDOCTOR: Don’t understand? No. You didn’t understand what you were building, who you were dealing with or what you’ve brought to this planet, but all we can do now is try to fix it.\nSTUART: That isn’t fair — I was [only -—]\nDOCTOR: Stop complaining and help. Our assumption is that Carolyn put the virus in the champagne?\nMEL: She must have done.\nSTUART: I wonder if it’s like how she did the induction?\nMEL: Induction?\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 100\nSTUART: Um, yes — the workforce needed to be trained in how to work with the imported components, but instead of showing them how to do it, she gave them all a cup of tea made with these herbs she brought, and they picked it up immediately.\nDOCTOR: And you didn’t question this.\nSTUART: I did! But she didn’t answer me.\nMEL: So, it’s almost like... a magic potion?\nDOCTOR: Almost. Stuart, is that champagne bottle still in your office?\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57. INT. SHIPYARD (CORRIDOR)\nORLA: There’s a door this way —\nACE: It doesn’t lead anywhere any more.\nORLA: Oh?\nACE: Page 101\nACE: Vinny used it, the walkway fell to pieces and we all nearly\nACE: drowned.\nORLA: Right. Then we’ll have to go down [here —]\nDANUTA: (OFF) You!\nDANUTA: Do you work here?\nORLA: Yes.\nACE: Yeah.\nDANUTA: Then you should be helping complete\nORLA: We’re [not —]\nACE: What do you need us to do?\nDANUTA: construction.\nDANUTA: Bring some more components up from the stores.

And this is a perfect chance to get aboard the ship.\nORLA: (LOW) Why d’you want to get aboard the ship?\nACE: (LOW) Sabotage, of course.\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 103\nACE: SCENE 58.

(RAISES VOICE) Eorgem — run a full diagnostic and report any faults.\nLEE: But the ship isn’t ready.\nCAROLYN: Running a diagnostic will show us where they need to hurry up.\nLEE: What’s the rush?\nCAROLYN: Unfortunately, under a very silly treaty signed by our ancestors, we’re forbidden to build military vessels. In fact, not just forbidden — it’s impossible. We’re bound by our own powers, and nobody knows how to undo it.\nLEE: That’s annoying.\nCAROLYN: Subcontracting the work to your world, countless light years away, has taken decades of covert planning. We believed this was off their radar, so to speak. But now it appears our enemies installed a spy here to gather evidence against us.\nLEE: Your enemies?\nLEE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 104\nCAROLYN: People whose worlds we conquered, and bleeding heart types who don’t want us to conquer them again. Which we will, once we\nCAROLYN: have our fleet.\nLEE: Why d’you need to conquer them?\nCAROLYN: Because if we don’t, they develop in\nCAROLYN: culture.\nLEE: That’s it?\nCAROLYN: It’s quite fundamental to us.\nLEE: And we've helped you do this? You’re\nLEE: [and —]\nCAROLYN: Shut up and massage my feet.\nLEE: What?\nCAROLYN: Merol tege sulac.\nLEE: Y..yes, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: a manner that offends our\nCAROLYN: going to take this ship\nCAROLYN: (RAISES VOICE) Tell the engine room to prepare the blood crystal for ignition.

SHIPYARD (STUART:’S OFFICE)\nDOCTOR: Is this the bottle?\nMEL: Did you and Carolyn finish that off yourselves?\nSTUART: I didn’t drink any.\nMEL: Didn’t you?\nSTUART: No, Carolyn gets offended if I don’t have a drink with her, but I had work to do, so I just poured it into that plant when she wasn’t looking.\nDOCTOR: Which explains how you didn’t appear to be infected at first.\nMEL: But Carolyn drank it.\nDOCTOR: Which means either it doesn’t affect her, or she doesn’t care if it does. There’s still a little left — I need to pour this out.\nSTUART: There’s a clean ashtray on the desk.\nDOCTOR: This stuff appears to be halfway between magic potion and biological warfare. Once incubated, it becomes a virus.\nMEL: So it could spread?\nDOCTOR: Via people, and via connections with other systems, yes.\nMEL: Before long every device in the world with an electronic circuit could be destroyed.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: If only I had access to the TARDIS’s medical scanner — she could probably whizz up an antidote...\nMEL: Do you have anything you can use?\nDOCTOR: I have... a soil analysis kit.\nSTUART: Great.\nDOCTOR: I think I can use it to isolate the active component... Mel?\nMEL: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Stick your tongue out.\nMEL: Hang on, is that a used cotton bud?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s a clean one.\nMEL: Ahh.\nMEL: Bleh.\nDOCTOR: Now, let’s see...\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60.

That’s it.\nDANUTA: Ma’am?\nCAROLYN: Ah, Suborchest Danuta.\nDANUTA: Work is complete, the ship is spaceworthy.\nCAROLYN: Is the blood crystal in place?\nDANUTA: Yes, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: Then all we need is blood. This one will do.\nLEE: Me?\nCAROLYN: You.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 109\nLEE: Blood?\nCAROLYN: One can hardly launch a ship without it. Grab him.\nLEE: No!\nDANUTA: Shall we do it here?\nCAROLYN: Oh! — Can we do it here?\nDANUTA: Yes, ma’am — there are seven different points of sacrifice in the ship. All the gutters lead to the engine room.\nCAROLYN: We’1ll do it down there. I don’t want to get blood on the controls.\nLEE: You can’t be serious — I work here!\nCAROLYN: (IGNORING HIM) Dismiss the workforce, and ensure all\nCAROLYN: crewmembers are on board.\nDANUTA: At once, ma’am.\nLEE: (PULLED ALONG, STRUGGLING) You maniacs!

SHIPYARD (STUART’S OFFICE)\nLEE: FRUSTRATED.\nMEL: No luck, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This kind of technology, with its arcane, occult stylings — it’s very, very old. The Great Vampires, the Demons... even my own people dabbled in such things, before we had our own age of enlightenment, as it were...\nSTUART: You’re not human either, are you?\nMEL: Can you do anything about this virus potion... thing?\nDOCTOR: It’s tricky. What I really need is equipment that operates on the same principles, was made by the same people.\nSTUART: (BEAT) Well... we do have some of their equipment here.\nDOCTOR: Of course — as long as the Eorgem aren’t using it right this minute... it could work.\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR: The gate. Come on!\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR: SCENE 63. INT.

This is weird. Let’s do this and get out of here.\nACE: What do we do?\nORLA: This was your idea!\nACE: I dunno, I thought if we got at the engine we could put it out of action somehow. But I don’t even understand this thing.\nORLA: What if we put something in the furnace that’s not meant to be in there?\nACE: I like that. I like that a lot.\nORLA: OK, what have we got?\nACE: Wish I had some nitro... I pocketed some of those orb things, how about that?\nORLA: OK — we just need to get this open [and —]\nORLA: DOWN THE CORRIDOR.\nACE: Someone’s coming.\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 112\nORLA: There’s a bulkhead there — hide!\nOTHER: TROOPS HOLDING LEE, WHO STRUGGLES.\nCAROLYN: Yes, the crystal’s warming up nicely. Put him in the harness, men!\nLEE: (STRUGGLING) Harness?\nCAROLYN: Yes, the one on the ceiling. Just out of interest — what did you think it was for, when you were installing it?\nLEE: Fishing nets?\nCAROLYN: Hahaha.\nLEE: Oh no. Oh please —\nCAROLYN: Give me the knife, I’1ll apply the deathstroke myself. A ship should have a blood connection with its captain.\nLEE: (WHIMPERING) Please...!\nCAROLYN: Stuart told me we should use workers from this area because they really put their heart and soul into everything they build.\nLEE: You can’t...!\nCAROLYN: See the channel by our feet? As your life’s blood flows, it will catalyse the blood crystal, and its energy will flood through this ship. The ritual will spread your very essence into this vessel and give her life. Your soul will fly on through the stars.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 113\nLEE: Please...\nCAROLYN: So cheer up.

I’m sure it’1ll be guarded.\nMEL: (LOW) So how do we get past?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) I suggest Stuart bluffs his way through —\nSTUART: (LOW) Me?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) You’re meant to be the boss of this place. Convince them\nDOCTOR: you’re meant to be in there.\nSTUART: (LOW) All right, all right.\nMEL: (LOW) Deep breath, Stuart. You can do this.\nSTUART: (LOW) OK.\nSTUART: Alright, now see here, this is my shipyard and — Oh.\nDOCTOR: There’s nobody here? — There’s nobody here.\nMEL: That’s good, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I’d like to think so, but if they’ve left no-one guarding the gate, that means they think we have no chance of beating them.\nSTUART: Oh.\nMEL: Or it might mean they’ve over-stretched their resources and need everyone aboard the ship?\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR: Ever the optimist, Mel. Now, inside.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR: SCENE 65. INT. SHIPYARD (STOCK ROOM) [CONTINUOUS]\nMEL: How does the gate help us with the virus, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Long-distance transportation devices work by breaking the body down and then reconstructing it at the other end, yes?\nSTUART: They do?\nMEL: Yes, they do.\nDOCTOR: In the process, it’s possible to use that system to isolate certain things from the body and remove them before arrival.\nSTUART: I don’t like where this is going.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you don’t, but it’s the best option we have.\nMEL: Stuart — if we don’t deal with this thing, we could spread it around the world — send the planet back into the dark ages!\nSTUART: Well, I don’t want that.\nMEL: Doctor — can you operate this gate?\nDOCTOR: To an extent.\nDOCTOR: WATER. IT COMES TO LIFE WITH A HUM.\nSTUART: Filling me with confidence here.\nDOCTOR: I confess, I am slightly regretting my decision to send Orla away, but I think we can make do...\nMEL: Where are you sending us?\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: I’m not going to alter the destination — that seems an unnecessary risk. There must be more controls in this thing —\nDOCTOR: Aha!\nSTUART: Should you really be doing that?\nMEL: Stuart, please, shut up and let the Doctor get on.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be too harsh, Mel — everything he’s spent the last few years building up has been exposed as a sham that threatens not only this world, but also the peace and stability of a distant galaxy. That’s not nice for anyone.\nSTUART: Thank you. I think.\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 118\nSTUART: SCENE 66. INT. SHIP (ENGINE ROOM)\nDANUTA: The remaining workforce have been evacuated from the yard, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: Did any of them die working on the ship?\nDANUTA: Surprisingly, no.

Why?\nACE: We need to get this furnace open and screw up [their —]\nACE: Look — it’s awful, I know, but we’ve got to do something, yeah?\nORLA: Yeah, yeah — it’s just, I knew Lee, I —\nACE: I know.\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 119\nACE: SCENE 67.

Engines won’t be ready to fire until next week —\nDOCTOR: I think I understand this thing.\nMEL: Really?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Bit of a museum piece, but I think I’ve got it —\nBACK: UP.\nDOCTOR: There.\nSTUART: Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: All you have to do is step through the gate and come straight back.\nMEL: The Doctor knows what he’s doing, Stuart. We’ll go through together, OK?\nSTUART: I suppose.\nMEL: You always said you wished we’d had time to travel together after college.\nSTUART: This wasn’t what I had in mind.\nMEL: Most people’s lives aren’t what they had in mind, Stuart. Mine certainly isn’t. Come on, take my hand.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 120\nMEL: SCENE 68. INT.

We’re both fine.\nSTUART: Or we're dead and we’ve gone to the afterlife together.\nMEL: You don’t believe that. So you’ve never been to this side?\nSTUART: No, we're strictly forbidden from coming through the gate.

And I think... something’s knocked my foot free. Yes!\nMEL: Lucky it didn’t get knocked clean off.\nSTUART: Weird. Your phone booth doesn’t seem damaged at all.\nDOCTOR: Of course not!

Did you fall off the Eorgem ship?\nORLA: No, we were pushed.\nSTUART: Orla!\nORLA: Evening, boss.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nORLA: I’m fine.\nMEL: Help her down then, Stuart.\nSTUART: sorry.\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 137\nORLA: It was weird — I didn’t feel us hitting the ground at all.\nDOCTOR: Emergency Severance System. The interior and the exterior detach briefly so you don’t feel the impact.\nACE: Oh, great. You might have told me about that.\nDOCTOR: Ace, do you really want to sit down of an afternoon and listen whilst I list every single feature and function of the TARDIS?\nACE: (SHE DOESN'T) Yeah.\nMEL: It’ll have to wait for another time — right now we have more pressing concerns.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. There’s a warship loose on this planet and they’re going to build an awful lot more of them.\nORLA: Their captain said something about ‘hexing’ the planet...?\nDOCTOR: I suspect that means they’re going to conquer it.\nSTUART: With one ship?\nDOCTOR: Having seen their technology, Stuart, I can say with confidence that we’re dealing with a species who’ve been waging wars since dinosaurs ruled your planet. They have capabilities you can’t comprehend. Yes, they most certainly can conquer your planet with one ship.\nORLA: Then how are we meant to beat them? We don’t have any weapons that’1ll be remotely effective.\nACE: There might be one thing. If the Doctor can fix it.\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 138\nACE: SCENE 83. INT.

Digital technology messes with their magic.\nMEL: That fits with the virus they infected me with.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. this is a highly sophisticated projection system. Dynamically reacts to the wearer’s movements and fills in their physicality to match the image, making it fully interactive.\nACE: Problem is, we need to get close to them to do it. And we’ve only got one of those and there’s loads of them.\nDOCTOR: I might be able to expand its field slightly, to protect several of us... although for that I’d need something capable of generating an environment.\nMEL: I know where we can find one of those.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 140\nMEL: SCENE 85.

It still gives us a safe space.\nMEL: We just have to work out what to do with it.\nACE: What if the ship’s got one weak spot we can hit?

It’s much riskier than your original idea, but I think... Mel, go and tell Stuart I need to ask a very large favour.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: SCENE 88. INT.

I’m not a very convincing liar.\nMEL: That is true. He forgot our anniversary once and made up some family drama as an excuse. Tied himself up in knots.\nSTUART: Exactly. And you were only cross for a couple of days —\nMEL: It was a week, at least.\nSTUART: But Carolyn might kill me.\nMEL: Stuart, this won’t work unless the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS exactly. Nobody else has a chance of getting aboard the ship. It has to be you.\nSTUART: Ald eight, alk night; El) do ae.\nORLA: Of course you will.\nORLA: IS LAUGHING.\nDOCTOR: I did tell you.\nMEL: What are you laughing about?\nSTUART: (TO ACE) Yeah, and what are you wearing?\nACE: This thing the Doctor’s rigged is seriously wicked.\nACE: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 147\nORLA: What does it do?\nDOCTOR: I’1ll explain in the TARDIS — assuming Stuart agrees to my plan?\nSTUART: Yeah, sure.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. And cheer up! I think there’s a more than even chance this will work.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: SCENE 91. INT.

It’s known locally as the Isle of Man.\nCAROLYN: I think we should encase it in ice.\nDANUTA: Very good, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: Who’s hailing us now?\nDANUTA: Someone from the shipyard.\nCAROLYN: How?\nDANUTA: Via the gate.\nCAROLYN: Visualise them.\nCAROLYN: PANICKY.\nSTUART: (D) Carolyn!\nCAROLYN: Cardinal Archmage Lynfess, please. Actually, I’d rather you called me ma’am. Stuart — who taught you how to use the gate?\nSTUART: (D) Doesn’t matter. Listen! There’s someone here plotting against you.\nCAROLYN: Well they’ve left it a bit late, we’ve gone. We’ll pay for the damage, by the way.\nSTUART: (D) No — there’s someone here, a spy for your enemies.\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 149\nCAROLYN: We know, he was dealt with.\nSTUART: (D) He wasn’t the only one. Look — I can tell you about him but they know I’m talking to you — it isn’t safe for me here! Please —\nDANUTA: (LOW) We could just let them kill him, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: (LOW) No, he’s proved useful and his ambition makes him easy to manipulate. (RAISES VOICE) Let him through the gate.\nSTUART: (D) Right —\nSTUART: Wow. So this is it, up [and —]\nCAROLYN: Just tell me about this spy.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 150\nCAROLYN: SCENE 92. INT. TARDIS\nMEL: Is the TARDIS alright?\nDOCTOR: The repairs aren’t entirely complete, but I think she can manage a short hop.\nACE: A short hop into a specific room inside a moving object and you’re not amazing at steering this thing at the best of times.\nDOCTOR: But we should have some assistance, Ace, so I think we’ll make it. Orla, how long has Stuart had?\nORLA: Fifteen minutes.\nDOCTOR: That should be long enough. No signal yet.\nMEL: What did you give him?\nDOCTOR: I removed part of the shield oscillator from the TARDIS and put it in Stuart’s pocket. TARDIS components give off a unique energy signal, which we should be able to lock onto.\nMEL: And... you don’t need this shield oscillator?\nDOCTOR: Not right now. Not unless their ship is equipped with a magno- grab, which I find highly [unlikely —]\nDOCTOR: That’s what we’ve been waiting for! The ship is currently flying over the Irish Sea...\nDOCTOR: Now, when we land you need to stay within about ten metres of Ace at all times.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 151\nORLA: What’s that in feet?\nMEL: About thirty.\nORLA: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: We need to make our way to the ship’s engine room. I’m going to land as close by as possible, but we may have some distance to make up and there’1ll be resistance.\nMEL: And how do we deal with that resistance?\nACE: I’ve got that covered.\nDOCTOR: Everyone — cross your fingers!\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: SCENE 93. INT. SHIP (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: Orla — how close are we to the engine room?\nORLA: Pretty close. It’s on the next deck down.\nDOCTOR: Splendid.\nORLA: So we need to reach those stairs and then go along [about sixty\nORLA: —]\nSOLDIER: (OFF) Intruders!\nDOCTOR: Ace! Switch on!\nACE: On it —\nSURROUNDED: BY THE WORLD OF THE ARCADE GAME (WITH MUSIC). ACE IS\nNOW: EIGHT FEET TALL AND HER VOICE HAS THE SCRATCHY, DISTORTED SOUND OF A CHARACTER IN THE GAME.\nACE: Alright, which one of you Goth stormtroopers is going down first?\nBEATING: UP A SUCCESSION OF THE SOLDIERS. WHEN SHE STRIKES THE WORKERS, HER PUNCHES AND KICKS SOUND LIKE THOSE IN THE GAME.\nMEL: What did you do?\nORLA: She looks a bit like that character in the game — Mighty Mizuko.\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 153\nMEL: She’s about eight feet tall!\nORLA: She’s the best character — she’s got a longer range on her kicks than any of the others.\nDOCTOR: I plugged Vinny’s projector into the engine of the game, so now the wearer takes on the appearance of the character in the game and the immediate area becomes the game environment.\nMEL: But it’s just a hologram, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: A digital projection, yes. But the Eorgem are uniquely vulnerable to digital technology — it weakens their own powers.\nACE: (OFF) Haha! This is wicked.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS) Ace! This is serious.\nACE: (OFF) That’s the last of them.\nDOCTOR: For now. But there’1ll be more. Let’s get moving. Remember, stay\nDOCTOR: close to Ace!\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR: SCENE 94. INT.

I don’t buy it.\nSTUART: But why take the risk? You could just continue to work in secret — I won’t tell anyone, [and —]\nCAROLYN: Stowaways again?\nDANUTA: I.. think so, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: I thought you swept the entire ship after the last lot?\nDANUTA: We did, we went [through —]\nCAROLYN: Deal with them, Danuta, or I’1ll sacrifice you to the ship.\nDANUTA: I will, ma’am.\nCAROLYN: She’s getting hungry, you know. And she says you look delicious.\nDANUTA: I'm... flattered.\nSTUART: (NERVOUS LAUGH) You talk to the ship?\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 155\nCAROLYN: Of course. (TO DANUTA) Where are they?\nDANUTA: Er, the visionaries say the intruders are on deck three, Spinward side. And... they’ve taken out nine of our troops already.\nCAROLYN: Nine?\nDANUTA: According to this, yes.\nCAROLYN: How?\nDANUTA: They seem to have brought with them a creature impervious to [our —]\nCAROLYN: Go and deal with this personally.\nDANUTA: At once.\nCAROLYN: (TO STUART) You know something about this.\nSTUART: No, no.\nCAROLYN: Yes, yes.

So it won’t kill you.\nSTUART: P... plea-\nCAROLYN: I know that might sound good, but it means this torture will last indefinitely. Unless I get bored and cut out your heart and feed it to the engines.\nSTUART: No — no, you —\nCAROLYN: Wait — I saw that look on your face when I said engines. What about the engines?\nSTUART: N-nothing —\nCAROLYN: Danuta, their target is the engines.\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 159\nCAROLYN: SCENE 98. INT.

The giant one. Kill her.\nACE: (D) Come on then —\nACE: TIME, ACE IS TIRING.\nORLA: Is she OK?\nORLA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 160\nDOCTOR: She’s getting tired. Just because their powers are diminished, doesn’t stop them from attacking altogether.\nMEL: Then let’s hurry! What do we need to do?\nDOCTOR: I was hoping the power core would shut down as soon as it came into contact with the digital environment...\nORLA: And it hasn’t?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I don’t know what it looks like when it’s — HURK!\nMEL: Doctor?\nACE: (D) Put him down!\nDANUTA: Switch off your vile device, or I kill this man.\nDOCTOR: Don’t turn it off, Ace.\nACE: (D) Put him down, toerag.\nDANUTA: I said, switch it off!\nACE: (D) I’ve dealt with the rest of your lot — you’re the last one left!\nDOCTOR: Ah. You hear that?\nDANUTA: Stop this.\nDANUTA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 161\nDOCTOR: That’s your engine dying. Your technology can’t function in this environment.\nMEL: Then... the ship will just fall out of the sky.\nDANUTA: No. The crew’s magic will keep it aloft —\nDOCTOR: For a while. But if that worked on a longer-term basis, you wouldn’t need engines, would you?\nMEL: Ugh — what’s that in the furnace?\nORLA: They called it a blood crystal before —\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’s decaying. In less than a minute it’1ll be useless.\nDANUTA: Switch off your device —\nDOCTOR: You’re too late. Your ship is doomed. Let me go and I’1l take you home.\nDANUTA: Why would you do that?\nDOCTOR: Because I don’t let anyone die if they don’t have to.\nDANUTA: But if I let you go, they’1l kill me.\nDOCTOR: If you don’t let me go, you’1ll die anyway. Up to you.\nDANUTA: (BEAT) Fine.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 162\nACE: (D) Did you mean that about taking him with us?\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nMEL: Can I point out that we are in the ship and the ship is falling out of the sky?\nDOCTOR: You can, but aren’t you forgetting something?\nORLA: (BEAT) Stuart!\nDOCTOR: Ace — leave the projector here.\nACE: (D) Awww. I like being eight feet tall and doing roundhouse kicks.\nDOCTOR: We need to be sure nobody comes in to repair the damage.\nACE: (D) Alright.\nDOCTOR: Orla — you and Ace go back to the TARDIS, I’ve put some sticky notes on the console, follow the instructions and you’1ll be ready to take off as soon as we come back.\nORLA: OK.\nDOCTOR: (TO DANUTA) What’s your name, old chap?\nDANUTA: Suborchest Danuta.\nDOCTOR: Delighted to meet you.

Socrita.\nCAROLYN: (CALLS) All crew — your priority is keeping the ship aloft! Everyone! (BEAT) And hoist him up.\nSTUART: Oh no. No —\nSTUART: TO STUART.\nCAROLYN: Yes. Another sacrifice should bolster us enough to effect a landing — and then we can repair.\nCAROLYN: You should have good blood. You’re not a vegetarian, are you?\nSTUART: Yes. Yes, I am.\nCAROLYN: You are a terrible liar. Thanks for all your work, but we’1l take it [from —]\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 164\nDOCTOR: Wait!\nCAROLYN: No, I don’t want to.\nMEL: Stuart — are you all right?\nSTUART: Not really.\nDOCTOR: You will listen to me, because you’1ll die if you don’t.\nCAROLYN: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. And I’ve just won.\nCAROLYN: This is the most powerful vessel on this planet and my troops have powers beyond anything you can dream of.\nDOCTOR: But you also have a basic weakness, and that’s why your empire collapsed in the first place, isn’t it? You’re utterly incompatible with a mode of technology that most civilisations develop eventually.\nCAROLYN: I’m going to kill this man and then take over this planet.\nMEL: It’s pointless. Your blood crystal is dying and your furnace is damaged beyond repair.\nCAROLYN: I don’t believe you.\nDANUTA: It’s true. The digital contagion is spreading through the ship\nCAROLYN: I take it you failed, then, Danuta?\nCAROLYN: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 165\nDANUTA: Because you launched the ship before we were ready, before we’d had a [chance —]\nCAROLYN: How dare you —\nCAROLYN: PARTS OF IT COLLAPSING.\nDOCTOR: The workplace politics can wait. Lynfess, release Stuart.\nCAROLYN: No.\nDOCTOR: We can save you — and your crew. This ship is doomed.\nCAROLYN: (CALLS) I’11 kill anyone who deserts their station.\nDOCTOR: Anyone who doesn’t desert their station will die anyway.\nDOCTOR: Face it, Lynfess — your attempt at conquering Earth is over. These people are developing digital technology so fast, this planet will be intolerable to you within a matter of years. You got here a fraction too late.\nCAROLYN: We can see to that. You’ve seen what we can do, I’1ll make sure they never develop anything more advanced than [a —]\nSTUART: No you won’t.\nCAROLYN: Wh-\nMEL: Nice kick!\nSTUART: Thanks. I did karate at school.\nSTUART: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 166\nDOCTOR: Mel — help me get him out of these chains!\nSTUART: Thank you.\nMEL: Thank you. I thought she was going to keep talking until we crashed.\nCAROLYN: (WINDED) This ship won’t crash. I’1l1 bring it in —\nDANUTA: No you won't.\nACE: Nasty kick.\nMEL: Never mind that — put the chains on her.\nDOCTOR: Mr Danuta? What’s our course?\nDANUTA: Downwards — what does it matter?\nDOCTOR: I’d prefer it if this ship didn’t crash into the centre of Belfast, that’s all.\nSTUART: Send it into the sea, is what he means.\nMEL: And well clear of the coast — we don’t want to cause a tidal\nMEL: wave.\nDANUTA: Into the sea it is.\nDANUTA: We surrender, Doctor.\nDANUTA: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 167\nCAROLYN: No!\nDOCTOR: Jolly good.

The job’s still on the table.\nMEL: (BEAT) No. Thank you. I’m happy doing what I’m doing.\nMEL: #228: THE BLOOD FURNACE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 172\nACE: You are coming, then?\nMEL: Of course!
