I’m perfectly happy to help, obviously, but I’m not awfully keen to join them.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but a distress beacon also suggests that whoever launched it had enough time to launch a distress beacon.

Should anything untoward happen.\nMEL: You do realise that isn’t a comfort, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: No-one’s come to kill us yet, so we’re doing alright for now.\nMEL: They could have attached a message.

Dust clouds?\nDOCTOR: Of the most iridescent kind.\nMEL: Shame the surface is so barren.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know, Mel. I think the contrast between the rocks and the sky is what makes the ensemble work. Like Sydney Harbour. I never can choose between the Opera House and the Bridge.\nMEL: Actually, it’s not all that barren, if you look. All those multi-coloured patches on the ground.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Lichen or seaweed, maybe? Must be humid out there.\nMEL: Those sculptures are odd, though.\nDOCTOR: Sculptures?\nMEL: Those sculptures. Behind us?\nDOCTOR: Oh. I was distracted by the view. Why odd? They look roughly human. More so than many sculptures you have on Earth.\nMEL: I’m not talking about the design. I mean their being here at all.

If you’ve achieved space-travel you should be able to afford elevators.\nDOCTOR: If you’d be willing to trust them in somewhere this ramshackle.\nMEL: Perhaps not. And look, more art. A mural? In a stairwell?\nDOCTOR: I can think of worse places to put a mural. It is quite the abstract, though.\nMEL: Abstract? I’d say messy.\nDOCTOR: It’s a shoe-in for the Turner Prize.\nDOCTOR: Here we are, next level down. Blast doors.\nDOCTOR: But not the most secure variety.

Perfect, they should tell us something about what happened here.\nMEL: If the dust hasn’t damaged them, of course.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s everywhere, isn’t it?

Aha!\nMEL: Have you found something?\nDOCTOR: A kind of electronic schematic. Portable too... (TAKES IT OFF THE WALL) It appears to be the layout of the base.\nMEL: Oh?\nDOCTOR: (READING) There’s a glass-domed viewing and recreation platform on the top storey -\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 13\nMEL: Where we landed.\nDOCTOR: Where we landed. Then downstairs to the ground floor -\nMEL: Where we are now.\nDOCTOR: Where we are now. (READING, STABBING HIS FINGER AT EACH LOCATION) Here we find power relays, equipment stores, a loading bay, a mess hall, an archive room and the Mining Computer Hub.\nMEL: That last one being this room, presumably?\nDOCTOR: Apparently so. Mining, eh?\nMEL: So it keeps going down then, does it, this base? Into mines?\nDOCTOR: Yes. After this floor it’s a lot of mineral labs spiralling\nDOCTOR: around a geothermal shaft. I imagine that provides energy for the base.\nMEL: Not very successfully. Probably on the fritz, judging by the way the lights flicker...\nDOCTOR: It goes very deep, all the way into the cave-systems. They’re spread out far below. The whole place is built on a geological fault - for ease of access below the crust.\nMEL: Ah. I think I’ve found something myself.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nMEL: This seems to be a... captain’s log.\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 14\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Playing recording.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: (THE LOG CRACKLES AND OBSCURES SOME WORDS - IN SQUARE\nPARENTHESES: )\nCARTER: (DISTORT) OK, Clovis, I’1l be up in a minute. - This is the personal log of Ava Carter, head of mineralogical research at the I.M.C. facility Piranesi-1l.\nDOCTOR: A mining company. Not my favourite people.\nCARTER: (DISTORT) The date is [October 28, 2996,] three months to the day since we started our mission.\nMEL: Well, that’s not terribly helpful.\nCARTER: (DISTORT) Although it’s still early days, all teams have reported some interesting - and potentially profitable - results. As anticipated from spectroscopic analyses off-world, this planet - designated E.R.M. four-nine-nine-seven - has a highly unique geology, despite its comparative youth in planetary terms.\nMEL: E.R.M. four-nine-nine-seven. Mean anything to you?\nDOCTOR: Not the proverbial sausage.\nCARTER: (DISTORT) We anticipate good yields of [trisilicate, limpidium and tetramanganese]. Red Team have reported interesting results with the seams running below Alpha-Lab, and Blue Team's exploration of the cave system suggests this is consistent with the lower strata. This stage of research is budgeted to last for another two trimesters, but projected revenues would seem to justify IMC’s initial investment and point to full-scale planetary excavation going forward.\nDOCTOR: And yet the whole place is deserted.\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 15\nCARTER: (DISTORT) Despite the loss of [Researcher Jovian in a cave accident last month] -\nMEL: Loss? Someone died?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. Or perhaps someone just flew home?\nCARTER: . morale is holding up well.

Nights are long and...\nCARTER: Hmm. Sounds like that’s it for the moment.\nDOCTOR: Shame it’s missing key information.\nMEL: (DISTANT) Yes. I’m not sure if the files or the system were corrupted, but I could try rebuilding them, with time.\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) You might not need it. According to this schematic,\nDOCTOR: there’s an archive through there. It must have more data!\nSTOD: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 16\nSTOD: SCENE 7: INT. ARCHIVE ANTE-ROOM\nDOCTOR: Yes, base archive through here.\nDOCTOR: Or perhaps not.\nMEL: That isn’t just locked, it’s jammed.\nDOCTOR: And seemingly re-engineered. So it would appear this schematic\nDOCTOR: doesn’t tell the whole story. What’s actually behind there, I wonder?\nMEL: Doctor... what are those dots?\nDOCTOR: What dots?\nMEL: Those dots, on the lower levels. They’re moving, ever so slightly.\nDOCTOR: Yes. In the... (CHECKS MAP) labs. I’d missed them completely.\nMEL: Life signs?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. Only one way to find out.\nMEL: Which is?\nDOCTOR: Head down and look.\nMEL: Are you sure? If those dots indicate whatever caused the\nMEL: emergency in the first place...\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m sure we've nothing to worry about, Mel. The level of sand everywhere, the lack of electricity, the general dilapidation. Whatever happened here happened long ago. And we've no reason to assume it was an act of violence.\nMEL: It usually is, though.\nDOCTOR: Given their comparative lack of movement, they might be trapped down there. Maybe a wall collapsed, or the roof caved in. They might be stuck there, slowly starving, awaiting rescue.\nMEL: I suppose.\nDOCTOR: We’ve got to look. We don’t have any choice.\nMEL: As long as we're cautious.\nDOCTOR: We will be. Now —- there’s a comms system over there. We can let them know we’re coming, tell them hope is on its way!\nMEL: Wait, what?\nDOCTOR: Hello?

THE COMBATANTS TUMBLE DOWNSTAIRS, STILL FIGHTING)\nDOCTOR: I think we’re clear. They’re taking their disagreement downstairs... Mel? Mel, where are you?\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11: INT. OTHER HALF OF CELLS, BEHIND DOOR [CONTINUOUS]\nMEL: Behind this door or wall, or whatever this is! It just appeared out of nowhere!\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Are you alright?\nMEL: Yes. The lights are completely out this side, but apart from\nMEL: that, everything’s fine.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) It must be a security door. Locks off the cells from the rest of the room. I think those two hit the controls in their melee.\nMEL: Hence it closing.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Yes, the controls are smashed. I’1l have to try releasing you from upstairs.\nMEL: Well... alright. I suppose it doesn’t seem especially dangerous.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) I’1l try to get the lights working as well. I'll be as quick as I can!\nDOCTOR: (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, JUST AUDIBLY, THE DOCTOR'S\nSTEPS: RECEDE)\nMEL: Bye, Doctor. — So much for us coming to the rescue...\nMEL: Hello? Is there someone there?\nMEL: Hello? I’ll come towards you. Are you hurt? I can’t see very\nMEL: well... (SHE STUMBLES ALONG) I'll feel my way along the wall. Keep whistling.\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL)\nMEL: SCENE 12: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nDOCTOR: Right. Door controls... door controls...\nDOCTOR: Page 24\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: SCENE 13: INT. ANTE-CHAMBER BETWEEN CELLS\nMEL: There, that’s it. Are you in there? The door’s locked. Can you hear me? Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED) Mel? I know you can’t reply, but I’m upstairs. I’m trying to open that shutter. There’s quite a few controls, but none of them are identified. I'll try the lot. Just a matter of\nDOCTOR: time. When you’re released, find me. Now, maybe if I try... this-\nDOCTOR: (A GRIND OF GEARS. THE CELLS DOORS ALL UNLOCK AND OPEN. THE\nHINGES: SQUEAK PAINFULLY )\nMEL: Security door, Doctor, not the cell doors!\nJACKSON: Not so fast, you!\nMEL: Let go of me! I wasn’t doing anything! Fast or otherwise!\nJACKSON: Not until we find out who you are...\nKETCH: Oh for goodness’ sakes Jackson, it’s not one of them!\nJACKSON: We don’t know that for sure!\nMEL: Will you get off! (EFFORT)\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 26\nKETCH: Ah, the lights, that’s better, now we can see! What are you doing on the floor, Mr Jackson?\nJACKSON: I... fancied a lie-down.\nKETCH: I think it’s best if we keep on our new friend’s good side. - Hello, Miss! Pleasure to make your acquaintance!\nMEL: (CAREFULLY) And yours...\nJACKSON: Easy, Clown! We still don’t know who she is. She’s clearly combat trained...\nMEL: Hardly! Some self-defence classes at the Village Hall, but I’m no karate kid. My name’s Melanie Bush. I’m here to help.\nKETCH: Yes, we heard your colleague’s message over the comms. I do apologise for my colleague’s manhandling of you. After the time we've had here, we couldn’t take any chances.\nJACKSON: Got to have a plan.\nKETCH: Yeah. “Whistle, then we grab her if we can.” Tactical genius, Mr Jackson.\nMEL: Well, I’ve had warmer welcomes, Mr...?\nKETCH: Forgive me, Miss. Ketch. Godfrey Ketch, all-round entertainer, late of the Galactic Pleasure Cruiser HMSS Unbelievable.\nJACKSON: Where have you come from?\nMEL: Well, Earth originally.\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 27\nKETCH: Ooh — Earth, eh? There’s posh! Slumming it a bit in the Outer Galaxy, aren't we?\nJACKSON: You’re a long way from home, Princess. How did you get here?\nMEL: I’m not a princess. And we’ve still not been properly introduced, Mr Jackson.\nJACKSON: Colonel Jackson.\nMEL: Colonel?\nJACKSON: You might have heard of me as “Anvil“ Jackson. I get about a bit.\nMEL: “Anvil”? That’s an odd name.\nJACKSON: Nickname. It’s actually the word for an ancient piece of Earth technology, used in the distant past for hammering nails into wood.\nMEL: No. That’s a hammer.\nJACKSON: A what?\nMEL: A hammer. Hence ‘hammering’.\nJACKSON: Ha! I don’t think so. I’d have to be an idiot not to know the meaning of my own nickname. So, Earth girl, what brings you this far into the Outer Galaxy? You're far beyond Terran jurisdiction here.\nMEL: I don’t know what you’re taking about. I came here with my friend the Doctor. We answered your distress beacon.\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 28\nJACKSON: Distress beacon? What... Who sent you?\nKETCH: Oh give it a rest, lad. I think Ms Bush here is as good as her word. And a personal physician too? Must be handy. Eccentric aristocratic lady on an adventure holiday, is it?\nMEL: Not exactly.\nJACKSON: Explains the clothes.\nMEL: What’s wrong with my clothes? And he’s not that kind of Doctor.\nMEL: I... Hang on, there were other life-signs on the schematic. Are there any more of you?\nKETCH: Hah, well I think you met Mr Stettimer on the way in.\nJACKSON: Lobster.\nKETCH: Crustacean, two and a half metres tall, fond of poetry. He’s difficult to miss.\nMEL: Yes... Something jumped us outside, I think he attacked it...\nKETCH: Aha, yes. One of our hosts, perhaps.\nMEL: Hosts?\nJACKSON: He means our jailers.\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 29\nJACKSON: SCENE 14: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nDOCTOR: Surely one of these must work...\nDOCTOR: Ah. So that’s how we get to the archive...\nDOCTOR: Well, if Mel’s shutter hasn’t opened already, she can wait a few more seconds...\nDOCTOR: (HE HEADS TO WHERE THE DOOR OPENED. AFTER HE’S GONE, A FEW\nMOMENTS PASS THEN: )\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Incoming spaceship. Prepare docking tube.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 30\nCOMPUTER VOICE: SCENE 15: INT. ANTE-CHAMBER BETWEEN CELLS\nKETCH: Sounds like Tethneka’s awake.\nJACKSON: Hey, Mother Superior. You in there?\nTETHNEKA: (APPROACHING) Jackson, is that you child?\nKETCH: Miss Tethneka. So glad you’re here. We weren’t sure you'd made it through this time.\nTETHNEKA: I was... meditating. The Seven Spiritual Exercises gave me the strength to withstand the solitary confinement. But who is this?\nKETCH: Ms Melanie Bush. From Earth, no less!\nMEL: Hello.\nTETHNEKA: Are you a prisoner, too?\nJACKSON: No. The princess here has come to rescue us all. She says.\nMEL: I’m not a — Oh, why won’t you believe me?\nTETHNEKA: Jackson’s heart has weathered much, child. He finds it difficult to trust. But all of us have suffered in this terrible place.\nMEL: Mr Ketch said you’ve all been imprisoned here.\nTETHNEKA: Indeed. Imprisoned, and worse.\nTETHNEKA: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 31\nMEL: But why? Who imprisoned you?\nKETCH: You don’t know?\nJACKSON: You’ve a nasty surprise coming up, Princess...\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 32\nJACKSON: SCENE 16: INT. SONTARAN CONTROL DECK\nJACKSON: (THE DOCTOR CREEPS IN. THE TECH TICKS OVER GENTLY. IT’S NEWER, AND DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT IN ORIGIN - SONTARAN, NOT HUMAN)\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Seems to be a command deck. (BEAT) That technology looks famil(iar) - Oh no...\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: SCENE 17: INT. ANTE-CHAMBER BETWEEN CELLS\nKETCH: Surprised you didn’t run into them upstairs.\nTETHNEKA: They are sorry, angry creatures.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED) Mel! We’re i[n terrible] danger! If the doors aren't open already, when they do, make straight for the TARDIS!\nJACKSON: That’s your ship?\nMEL: Yes. But ‘danger’?\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED) I found a command deck. It had alien technology wired into its systems, and I recognised which technology!\nDOCTOR: Now... maybe this switch -\nDOCTOR: (THE DOORS GRIND SOMEWHERE BEHIND. SKEGG MUTTERS IN THE\nDISTANCE: )\nKETCH: Wrong set of doors, matey-bob. That’s the cells again, not the door to the staircase...\nJACKSON: Doesn’t seem too bright for a physician...\nMEL: The Doctor’s a genius! If we’re in trouble, he’s the best person to get us out of it.\nKETCH: But he might need a locksmith to do it.\nMEL: I think it’s the system. Do you know anything [about...]\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 34\nTETHNEKA: Wait! Can you hear, from the punishment cell?\nMEL: Punishment cell?\nJACKSON: The far end, over there. I think your friend just opened it...\nKETCH: You’re right, my dear. Who could that be?\nMEL: You don’t know?\nTETHNEKA: We were the only prisoners.\nJACKSON: Another “rescuer“? Or a trap?\nJACKSON: (THEY APPROACH THE PUNISHMENT CELL. THE QUIET GIBBERING ECHOING\nFROM: IT GETS LOUDER AS THEY APPROACH)\nTETHNEKA: He sounds distressed, whoever it is.\nMEL: If you were the only prisoners, who’s in there?\nKETCH: That’s what I wanna know.\nKETCH: (JACKSON PUSHES IT OPEN. THE DOOR CREAKS. THEY GASP IN SURPRISE AS THE MUTTERING FIGURE IS REVEALED)\nMEL: What’s that?\nJACKSON: One of our jailers!\nSKEGG: Leave me alone! Keep them away from me! I’m scared!\nSKEGG: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 35\nSKEGG: SCENE 18: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on -\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Ship fully docked.

If he is involved, that complicates matters. We must devise a suitable strategy.\nKLATH: I will prepare an intelligence report on his last known activities in this sector. His appearance is always a variable parameter, however.\nKAYSTE: The Doctor is famed for his duplicity, Klath. It must be expected.\nGYTE: Chief Technician Gyte reporting, sir.\nKAYSTE: Ah, Gyte. We are beset by power and lighting failures.

The 47™ may have underestimated the level of dereliction. It appears to have infected the Sontaran systems too. (PRODS THE TERMINAL) I am trying to locate Commander Skegg’s research notes on this terminal, but they appear inaccessible. See what you can find, Gyte.

The shape is familiar. It seemingly represents an exploding Rutan battle-cruiser, cursed be their tentacles.\nTROOPER: #1: I had not realised that, Field-Major, but now...\nKAYSTE: I am a veteran of far more engagements than you, Trooper. There\nKAYSTE: is evidence of mental imbalance in this facility’s former crew. This crude attempt at graphic representation may be symptomatic of that. The pigment used...

But you got us free, well done.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I did open the right door in the end, that’s good to know.\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) So the Sontarans upstairs weren't the first to arrive on this base. But what killed our friend here, I wonder?\nJACKSON: Judging by those claw marks on his face, reckon my crustacean chum was responsible. He was the first one you let out of the cells.\nDOCTOR: So this Sontaran was the creature following me and Mel when we\nDOCTOR: first arrived? It was so dark at the time, I couldn't tell.\nJACKSON: I came down here to find him.\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR: If this is his handiwork, are you sure that’s wise?\nJACKSON: Can you think of someone better to have on your side?

That’s a long time.\nKETCH: Long enough.\nMEL: How long have you been here?\nTETHNEKA: My ship was intercepted by a Sontaran cruiser two lunar cycles ago.\nKETCH: Not much longer than me. The Unbelievable was boarded, most of the crew and passengers killed. I got off lightly. Some upsides\nKETCH: to being a freak, I suppose...\nMEL: You’re not a freak, Mr Ketch. When we get out of this, which I\nMEL: promise you we will do, we’ll find you a place where you'll feel right at home.\nGYTE: You, orange human!\nMEL: You mean me?\nGYTE: I see no others with your plumage.

There’s something wrong on this planet, Jackson. Something’s manipulating us.

Typical of a lesser race.\nKAYSTE: A lesser race?! Weakling scum like you are in no position to judge the glorious Sontaran war-machine! I see how this goes...

You are all in his employ, infiltrating this facility from the inside!

Why didn’t he listen?\nTETHNEKA: You overestimate these beings and their capacity for rational thought.\nKLATH: Do not confer. Walk quicker.\nMEL: But surely you can tell us, Commander Klath. Is Kayste usually this unreasonable?\nKLATH: Field-Major Kayste is my superior and in command.\nMEL: You’re an officer, too. You must have a responsibility to question his orders if they seem... erratic?\nKETCH: Doolally, even?\nKLATH: Mine is not to question. I am no mutineer.\nMEL: Of course not. But what if his orders compromise your mission?\nKLATH: Our mission is to return to the Hammerhead Nebula as soon as possible. (STOPS) We are here. Trooper, secure these primitives in the constraints.\nMEL: You saw the log, Klath. You can’t ignore that evidence. Something is happening here!\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page\nKLATH: That is no longer my concern, nor yours. You are research specimens.

The clouds...\nKAYSTE: Yes, research data concerning the effects of the dust clouds will arrive shortly. Now... (PUNCHES THE LOG UP) You were an officer with an exemplary record, a veteran of hard-fought campaigns. Your researches were commended by Central Command for their thoroughness. This makes your mental deterioration all the more dishonourable. And surprising...\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 93\nKAYSTE: SCENE 51: INT. ATRLOCK\nKETCH: Well, this is a fine way to end up. Thought I’d die on stage, not somewhere like this. I mean, I never wanted to join the Space Fleet, or anything, despite the adverts: travel the galaxy, seek out new life-forms and new civilisations, flog ’em stuff, if they don’t want it, blow ’em up and nick their planet. No, I thought clown a more honourable - and safe - vocation.\nTETHNEKA: Mr Ketch, I find it better to face death with more calm and fewer words.\nMEL: We’re not finished yet, Tethneka.\nKETCH: I crave your indulgence a moment longer. I’m afraid I didn’t\nKETCH: give you a decent performance of my act when I had that funny turn, Ms Melanie.

I’d rather make sure Mel and the others are safe.\nJACKSON: And I’d rather make sure I am. Butler — for the moment, this is where we part.\nDOCTOR: I thought it might be. Very well, Mr Jackson. If you get in trouble - aim for the vent on the back of the Sontaran neck.\nJACKSON: Sorry?\nDOCTOR: You’1l understand.\nJACKSON: (SHOUTING OUT) Don’t worry! I’1l come back for you! Probably. Right. Where’s that storeroom? (HEADS OFF)\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 95\nJACKSON: SCENE 53: INT. SONTARAN CONTROL DECK\nKLATH: The alien specimens are secure in the airlock, Field-Major.\nKAYSTE: Good.\nKAYSTE: You have something more to report, Commander?\nKLATH: I do not believe the mining log is a fabrication, sir. Its data may be of value.\nKAYSTE: Any situation where the Doctor is involved will be filled with traps and counter-intelligence, Klath. However, observing Skegg’s state of mind, it seems the Doctor has used strong psychological techniques that could prove useful. We may further justify this unwelcome intrusion into our schedule. You\nKAYSTE: say this “log” provides a depiction of the humans’ mental deterioration?\nKLATH: Yes, sir.\nKAYSTE: We will perform another experiment. This weakling coward will assist. Take Skegg to this log, secure him, and make him\nKAYSTE: witness the humans’ descent into hysteria. It may shock him into lucidity. Have him observed for any useful data that ensues.\nKLATH: Very good sir. This way, Commander.\nSKEGG: No! I cannot be out there in the...\nKAYSTE: Stop your snivelling! You are no longer a commander. Klath! This wretch is to be considered stripped of all rank and privileges from now on.\nKLATH: But, by what authority...\nKLATH: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 96\nKAYSTE: Do you question me, Klath?\nKLATH: No, Field-Major! But this is most irregular...\nKAYSTE: I am the sole authority on this mission! Central Command is half a galaxy away. We do not have the luxury of due process!\nKAYSTE: Take this... nothing of a Sontaran and begin the experiment.\nKLATH: Sir!

The shapes in the darkness! The sounds they weave... No!\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. I won’t hurt you. Is that why they were showing you footage of the previous crew?\nSKEGG: They perished in the darkness. But I can hide from them there.\nDOCTOR: From whom? The last crew?\nSKEGG: No! The faces. In the clouds...\nDOCTOR: Faces?\nSKEGG: We saw shapes as the dust clouds floated past... Vast... Fast... It made no sense! There were no such shapes! But still we saw them! Ships, faces, creatures. They taunted us... Stod made images, with dust and rust and must. Not maps. Not diagrams. They have no purpose! Just pictures! Battles in space, explosions, nebulas... He daubed them on the walls. The colours, he looked for right colours!\nDOCTOR: The mural on the staircase, yes.\nSKEGG: He used Glarr’s blood - just the right shade of green, he said.\nDOCTOR: Eat your heart out, Jackson Pollock. What did you do, Skegg?\nSKEGG: The darkness. The voices in the darkness below. They sounded like shapes. Patterns. I could touch the sounds. I brought them to the surface. I carried thoughts that were not my own. I found two sculptures upstairs. I made them into the shapes of... I tried to put order on them!\nSKEGG: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: You tried to tame the muse...\nSKEGG: Shapes I could understand! Shapes, ships, shame... But I could not stop, I hid in the darkness. I could not stop the shapes, the structures building around me, the colours I could hear,\nSKEGG: and this...\nDOCTOR: Oh, a quilt. Did you weave that out of your uniform?\nSKEGG: Yes, the patterns forced themselves out of my fingers,\nSKEGG: lingers... What is this? Why can I not stop it? Why?\nDOCTOR: It’s quite beautiful, Skegg. I never thought I’d compliment a\nDOCTOR: Sontaran on a matter of aesthetics, but there’s a first time for everything.\nGYTE: Human!\nDOCTOR: Ah, glad you could join us! Gyte, I assume? Power relays fixed?\nGYTE: Someone recalibrated the thermal relays. I now see who...\nJACKSON: (LEAPING OUT) Recalibrate this, you monster!\nDOCTOR: Jackson, no!\nDOCTOR: (JACKSON STABS GYTE IN THE VENT WITH HIS LASER CUTTER. GYTE\nDIES: HORRIBLY )\nGYTE: Aaargh!\nGYTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 101\nJACKSON: Said I’d come back. There — laser cutter, right in that vent. Found it in the stores. Thanks for that neck tip, butler. This\nJACKSON: guy’s not getting up again.\nDOCTOR: I thought you’d knock them out, not stab them in the back!\nJACKSON: Too late for games, butler. It’s payback time. Now, this one I recognise...\nDOCTOR: Jackson, no! There’s been enough killing for one day!\nJACKSON: Hey, this guy tortured me for a month!\nDOCTOR: Be that as it may, look at him now! Is that the face of your\nDOCTOR: torturer? There’s something at work here, not just the Sontarans — can’t you see it?\nJACKSON: What I can’t see is how any of this is my problem. We need to get out of here. You’ve got a ship, haven't you?\nDOCTOR: We can’t leave.\nJACKSON: My laser cutter says we can. Unless you want to argue with it.\nJACKSON: Leave Skegg. So he’s learned to knit. Big whoop. We are leaving. Now.\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 102\nJACKSON: SCENE 56: INT. ATRLOCK\nJACKSON: (MEL IS AT THE DOOR CONTROL, KETCH STARTS RANSACKING A LOCKER. THE DUST CLOUD OUTSIDE IS GATHERING)\nKETCH: Maybe there’s something in these lockers... Ah, respirators! Bit vintage, but better than nothing! How are you doing with that door, Ms Melanie?\nMEL: I think I’ve found the over-ride sequence.\nKETCH: Good-o. I don’t like the look of that dust cloud. (COUGHS) Think it’s seeping in. Miss Tethneka, don’t stand there, you'll choke!\nTETHNEKA: Lis;\nMEL: Let’s see if I’m right...\nMEL: There! That’s the over-rides gone! We might be able to open it by hand!\nKETCH: Righty-ho! Think my bendy limbs might come in useful here, if we both have a go!\nMEL: Tethneka! Give us a hand. Come on, it’s nearly open!\nTETHNEKA: Yes. Let me...\nKETCH: Shake a leg! That’s it, now...\nKETCH: (TETHNEKA ADDS HER WEIGHT. THE DOOR OPENS FURTHER. SHE SLIPS\nPAST: THEM AND GOES OUT)\nKETCH: There you go, Tethneka, my dear! You’re through! Now use the control and let us out!\nKETCH: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 103\nKETCH: Agh!\nMEL: Ow! No, Tethneka. You’re locking it again! What are you doing?\nKETCH: Can’t you hear us? What’s wrong with her? (HE THUMPS AT THE GLASS OF THE DOOR)\nMEL: She’s smiling! Why...?\nKETCH: First time I’ve seen her do that for a while...\nMEL: Forget her! The dust cloud’s here!\nMEL: Grab a respirator!\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 104\nMEL: SCENE 57: INT. OBSERVATION DOME\nMEL: (JACKSON AND THE DOCTOR ENTER. THE THREE SONTARANS MARCH AROUND\nMADLY: )\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED WHISPER) Sontarans, keep back!\nTROOPER: #4:\nTROOPER: (REPEATS THROUGHOUT, UNDER) Left and right and one and two. Left and right and left and slide. Left and right and step, ball change. Shuffle. Hands. And again.\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) Well that’s odd.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Sontaran drill patterns aren’t usually this elaborate. Or... dance based.\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) They’ve lost it! They’ve completely lost it.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you! Look at the\nDOCTOR: shapes they’re making, the shapes of the statues, the shapes in the dust outside.\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) I’m looking. I’m not seeing.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) They may be abstract, but they’re remarkably similar wouldn’t you say? Something is manipulating us all. Making us behave erratically, and these shapes are our attempts to control the madness. There is an intelligence that exists beneath our feet and in the air outside.\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) None of this makes me think of intelligence, butler.\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 105\nJACKSON: SCENE 58: INT. SONTARAN CONTROL DECK\nKETCH: (DISTORT) Tethneka, why are you doing this?\nKAYSTE: See, Klath. The spies betray one another!\nMEL: (OVER MONITOR) Ignore her! Put this on or we’ll both choke!\nKAYSTE: This lack of moral fibre amongst the lesser races is sickening.\nKLATH: Sir, the channel outside the airlock. The Tellaxi appears to be Signalling us.\nKAYSTE: Switching comms channel.\nTETHNEKA: (OVER MONITOR) - is escaping! Do you hear me, Sontarans? The Doctor is about to escape in his craft!\nKAYSTE: What? Switching to upper deck!\nKAYSTE: (THE MONITOR IS SWITCHED TO THE PIRHOUETTING SONTARANS IN THE\nUPPER: DECK. KAYSTE HISSES IN FURY)\nKAYSTE: What is this ridiculous display?\nKLATH: Sir! In the corner! That must be the Doctor and another human!\nKAYSTE: (STABS CONTROLS) Beta squad! Attention! Cease prancing this instant! The Doctor is there! I will join you. Kayste out.\nKLATH: Sir, surely you should remain here to oversee...\nKAYSTE: Do not command me, Klath! You are perilously close to a charge of insubordination!\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 106\nKLATH: Sir! I meant no such thing. I will remain here and oversee operations.\nKAYSTE: Better. Consider this a warning. Now to apprehend the Doctor myself!\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 107\nKAYSTE: SCENE 59: INT. OBSERVATION DOME\nKAYSTE: (THE SONTARAN DRILL CONTINUES, REPEAT OF THE SAME WORDS AS BEFORE, UNDER: )\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) They haven’t spotted us yet. If we’re quiet and careful, we might just get past them. Doesn’t look they’re paying much attention to Kayste’s orders...\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) Doesn't matter if they do. Look! I think one of them’s dropped a blaster. I might just be able to reach it.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Maybe it was Skegg’s. When he lost his mind and started on the sculptures. (REALISATION) Odd shape, aren't they? They rather resemble those gems you found...\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) Really? (PATS HIS POCKETS) Actually, that’s a point, where are my gems?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Never mind your gems now.\nJACKSON: (SOTTO) I’ve lost them!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) You’re better off without them. We’ve got more pressing concerns.\nJACKSON: (GETTING LOUDER) You might have, I don’t! I must have lost them when I attacked that Technician. (LOUD) Blast it!\nTROOPER: #4: What is that -— [sound?] Humans!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, it appears they’ve noticed us now...\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nSKEGG: Now I am free from this chair... I can hide in the dark again... Feel the patterns around me.\nSKEGG: Wait... I hear you again! I can touch your thoughts in my mind!\nSKEGG: Such patterns... There you are! A gemstone? What are you doing on the floor? A gemstone. A gemstone for me? Not a thought. How\nSKEGG: did you get up here? How did you...?\nSKEGG: I can feel you drawing me... upstairs? No, too many there. Not safe. Outside! Yes, outside! You want to be with the clouds, don’t you? Make new patterns, new colours. I will take you there. I will take you... New patterns, new colours... New shapes...\nSKEGG: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 109\nSKEGG: SCENE 61: INT. ATRLOCK\nSKEGG: (MEL AND KETCH WEAR RESPIRATORS.

Why’s she done this?\nKETCH: (MASK) She’s an odd-un and no mistake.\nMEL: (MASK) Wait, there’s someone else there now - (GASPS) A Sontaran!\nSKEGG: Yes, my gemstone, my beautiful perfect gemstone, I shall take you to meet the dust cloud! The colours will be brilliant!\nMEL: (MASK) Quickly, get out before she can close it again!\nSKEGG: Out of the way, human!\nKETCH: (MASK) Oof, no need to barge me out the way, you’re welcome, mate.\nMEL: (MASK) Mr Ketch, get to [the...]\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 110\nKETCH: (MASK) Locked out.

Can’t hear you!\nJACKSON: (HE OPENS FIRE. MASSIVE FIRE-FIGHT; THE BLASTS STRIKE THE DOME,\nWHICH: CRACKS)\nDOCTOR: Stop it, Jackson! There’s something out there, some kind of plant! It’s growing!\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s inside now! Keep away from the fronds! The flowers!\nTROOPER: #4: Die, human scum!\nJACKSON: Who cares? It’s not interested in us, it seems to like those statues!\nDOCTOR: (WORRIED REALISATION) Not just the plant, the cloud likes them\nDOCTOR: too... They're part of the same organism! Everyone, keep away from the statues!\nJACKSON: What in - what’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The frond’s integrated with the statues and the cloud’s triggered their transformation.\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 114\nJACKSON: Into what?\nJACKSON: (THE STATUES BUBBLE ORGANICALLY AND START TO MOVE, POLYPS BURSTING.

Tethneka’s smiling again. I don’t think that’s a good Sign.\nDOCTOR: (TO TETHNEKA) This is what you want, isn’t it, Bloom? Conflict, violence, surging emotions - they’re intoxicating you!\nKAYSTE: Klath, I am sorry. Klath! - You, Tellaxi, rock-thing or whatever you are, you will pay for this!\nDOCTOR: Kayste, no! That’s what she wants - or thinks she wants. Control yourself!\nMEL: She can still flood the base with the dust-cloud, remember.\nKAYSTE: (RESTRAINT) Enough! Very well. Stalemate. What is to be done? No answer, Tellaxi? (PAUSE) Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: Mel, what were you saying about what happened to Skegg?\nKAYSTE: That coward...\nMEL: Mr Ketch told me - he was killed carrying a rock into the dust\nMEL: cloud - it “sprouted” into a tendril or something...\nDOCTOR: That’s what burst into the dome. So that’s what the “gemstones” were. Parts of a larger organism... like eggs, or seeds. Except\nDOCTOR: you've used the people here to carry your seeds from the mineral seams below into the atmosphere above.\nMEL: Like the “sculptures” upstairs!\nDOCTOR: Yes, colonies of cells... Or perhaps coral polyps would be a better analogy. And the dust-cloud pollinates them!\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 134\nMEL: Like plants... made of stone?\nDOCTOR: Something like that. An intelligent, silicone-based life-form crawling its way to the surface of this planet like your ancestors crawled onto land. Or rather - persuading other life forms to take them to the surface. (TO TETHNEKA) This base\nDOCTOR: isn’t built on a geological fault at all, is it?\nTETHNEKA: It is built on us.\nDOCTOR: So you needed a new way to reach the atmosphere. Fascinating...\nKAYSTE: This creature’s life-cycle is irrelevant!\nDOCTOR: Oh no, it’s not! It uses emotion, feeds off it - first it was the miners, but that took place over months; then your research team arrived years later and their fear inducers stirred things\nDOCTOR: up again! Turbo-charged it! When they met me...\nTETHNEKA: You were richer and more stimulating than anything else we had tasted!\nDOCTOR: Flatterer. You see, Kayste? We're watching evolution happen at breakneck speed.\nTETHNEKA: We have shaped ourself around the lives of all the creatures dwelling here.\nDOCTOR: Yes — the dust everywhere, it’s part of the organism, too. It’s infiltrated the entire system.\nMEL: All those power cuts. The door mechanisms going wonky!\nDOCTOR: A low-level telepathic field throughout the facility. That\nDOCTOR: explains Ava Carter’s “ghost”!\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 135\nTETHNEKA: Indeed, Doctor. We saw her on the surface of your mind. (HER\nVOICE: BECOMES CARTER’S)\nCARTER: Your thoughts about her were loud, they interested us. (VOICE REVERTS TO POSSESSION, AS BEFORE: )\nTETHNEKA: We wanted you to join us in the caves.\nDOCTOR: And Tethneka’s telepathic ability made her the ideal mouthpiece for you.\nTETHNEKA: The spiritual exercises helped Tethneka to clear her mind, especially under torture. And made it easier for us to enter.\nDOCTOR: So now what? What do you want? Raw primal emotions are easy to\nDOCTOR: see, but there’s so much more you can learn.\nTETHNEKA: (CURIOUS) More...?\nDOCTOR: I can show you, but you must stop threatening us all. Violence\nDOCTOR: is not the only way [to...]\nSTETTIMER: Creatures!\nMEL: That’s got to be ‘Lobster’...\nSTETTIMER: Die!\nKAYSTE: Fire at will! His carapace must have a weak point!\nSTETTIMER: Your heads are a weak point!\nSTETTIMER: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 136\nSTETTIMER: See? I caught you by surprise. With a pincer movement.\nKAYSTE: Levity is not appropriate, crustacean!\nMEL: Enough with the comedy critique. Let’s get out of here!\nDOCTOR: The control deck. Quickly!\nDOCTOR: (THE DOCTOR, MEL AND KAYSTE RACE OFF. FIGHT CONTINUES FOR A FEW\nMORE: BEATS)\nMORE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 137\nMORE: SCENE 76: INT. SONTARAN CONTROL DECK\nDOCTOR: Stettimer’s been down in the caves. It’s driven him mad.\nMEL: How do we seal the door?\nKAYSTE: That button.\nDOCTOR: Rather surprised to see you flee the battle, Field-Major.\nKAYSTE: What - I — (REALISATION) The shame of it!\nMEL: Don’t worry. Everyone’s behaving oddly here. Thanks to the Bloom.\nKAYSTE: It must be stopped.\nDOCTOR: That is rather the idea. It’s why we came in here. I couldn't exactly do anything with Sontaran guns blazing everywhere.\nKAYSTE: I shall set up a trap with the computers. A containment field. Capture or destroy this being. You, Doctor, can be my technician, since Gyte has retreated to the battlegrounds of the afterlife. You, human, can be bait.\nMEL: Bait? We should be working together, Kayste, not sacrificing each other.\nDOCTOR: Mel’s quite right. We don’t know how much of the base systems the Bloom has under its control. It could be toying with us.\nKAYSTE: You have an alternate plan?\nDOCTOR: Maybe if we set up something with the mining equipment...\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 138\nKAYSTE: I do not need maybes! I need certainties!\nKAYSTE: Life signs depleting. It appears I am running out of troops... It must be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: No! I don’t think the Bloom is evil, Field-Major.\nMEL: No?\nDOCTOR: The organism has been dividing and reproducing itself using the minds of the people here. It follows where they lead. Creating patterns out of the gemstones helped it get nearer the surface, but it was the sheer joy and freedom of creation that drove people mad... before it got sidetracked by the Sontarans psychotic tendencies.\nKAYSTE: This is of little interest. I have only one constructive course of action.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nKAYSTE: I fill this facility with combustible gas and blow it up.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nMEL: How? You can’t get past it, not while it’s in the Computer Room!\nKAYSTE: This Control Deck has an emergency vent into the airlock itself, for swift escape in the event of emergency.\nMEL: Well, I think this applies as an emergency.\nDOCTOR: There are still living beings here, Kayste, you can’t just blow them up.\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page\nKAYSTE: Watch. The vent is over [here. ]\nMEL: But -— there’s someone coming out!\nKETCH: So, where the devil am I? Ms Melanie! And you must be the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Er -\nMEL: Mr Ketch!\nKETCH: And —- Oh.\nKAYSTE: Ah. The bendy one.\nKETCH: Mister Bendy One to you, squire.\nMEL: How did you escape?\nKETCH: Found a loose plate in the ceiling. Did you know there’s an emergency vent directly to the airlock?\nDOCTOR: We were beginning to suspect, yes.\nKAYSTE: Silence. It is our means of escape. If I release the inner\nKAYSTE: 139\nKAYSTE: airlock door from here, we may be able to reach a storage bay...\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 140\nKAYSTE: SCENE 77: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nTROOPER: #6: Hold him Sked! I will stave his shell in!\nSTETTIMER: You are not strong enough to hold me, egg-men. Broad my claw!\nTROOPER: #7: Aargh!\nTETHNEKA: Your rage thrills me, Stettimer! Such power, such violence!\nTROOPER: #6: I will blast you to atoms!\nSTETTIMER: Small your eyes, poor your aim!\nTROOPER: #6: Aargh! My blaster!\nSTETTIMER: I need no such weapons!\nTROOPER: #6: Come then, Losturan, I will tear the shell off you!\nTETHNEKA: Yes, yes! (LAUGHS) Your savagery is wonderful!\nTETHNEKA: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 141\nTETHNEKA: SCENE 78: INT. EQUIPMENT STORE\nKAYSTE: Inside. Find me a gas canister. Something that will be both explosive and highly toxic to all life, including silicone- based.\nMEL: Quite a specific shopping list, wouldn’t you say...\nKETCH: Would you like it gift-wrapped, with a little bow?\nKAYSTE: Silence!\nDOCTOR: Why should we help you, Field-Major?\nKAYSTE: If I point my laser stick at this female’s head, does that suggest an answer?\nDOCTOR: I suppose it does, yes. I should be able to locate some chemical compound that works the way you want, sad to say.\nKAYSTE: Then do so. Swiftly.\nMEL: What do you intend to do?\nKAYSTE: The Time Lord has a respiratory bypass system. You lesser species may not, but you appear to have retained the respirators from the airlock.\nKETCH: What, this old thing? It doesn’t really go with what I’m wearing...\nKAYSTE: With these, you will be able to withstand the effects of the gas, so I shall claim a readiness to parlay with the Bloom. I then send you in ahead as mules to carry the canisters into its presence.\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 142\nMEL: Wonderful. I’ve always wanted to be a mule.\nKETCH: A mule’s better than an ass, which is what I’m usually called, so I’d consider it a promotion.\nKAYSTE: I will have my laser trained on you, should you wish to disobey. Well, Doctor? Have you located such a chemical?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) I’m very much afraid I have...\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR: SCENE 79: INT. COMPUTER ROOM\nSTETTIMER: Yes, feel my claws around your neck!\nTROOPER: #6: (CHOKES) Alien scum...\nSTETTIMER: I have vanquished you, egg-man! I am victorious! (ROARS OF\nTRIUMPH: )\nTETHNEKA: Yes... (REALISATION) Where are the others?\nSTETTIMER: They have fled, like the Pendran Hordes at the Battle of Vendaris 5. Yes... Pendrans scattered in their thousands/ Broken spirits, burning ships/ Laughing Vestimer took his war-prize/ Deadly was his workmanship...\nTETHNEKA: Where are they? Have they hidden in their little cavern behind\nTETHNEKA: the wall here...?\nTETHNEKA: (SHE PRESSES THE DOOR CONTROL TO THE SONTARAN CONTROL DECK. THE\nDOOR: SLIDES OPEN)\nDOOR: Come out, Doctor. We wish to... Empty! Where are they?\nMEL: Over here!\nSTETTIMER: The stairwell? But —\nDOCTOR: Tethneka! Bloom! Whatever you’re calling yourself now!\nTETHNEKA: Doctor! You join us again...\nKETCH: Oh, look, in the corner. It’s Mr Stettimer.\nKETCH: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 144\nMEL: Yes. Big chap, isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: We come in peace! Although I’m not sure that’s what you want, given the number of bodies surrounding you, but still...\nTETHNEKA: You will teach us more. We will drink deep of you...\nDOCTOR: Will you? I suppose I am quite intoxicating. But if you do, let my friends go.\nTETHNEKA: They are less flavoursome. But they will feed us too.\nDOCTOR: How? What will you do? Get them to fight each other? Live in constant terror, so you can get the occasional fix? You've\nDOCTOR: learned too much from the Sontaran rabble that took over this base.\nMEL: Er, Doctor, aren’t you forgetting someone?\nDOCTOR: If you’re going to model yourself after a species, choose a\nDOCTOR: half-decent one. Not a bunch of neckless thugs who can’t shoot straight.\nKETCH: Steady on, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: They've stretched out a minor skirmish with some space-suited\nDOCTOR: amoebas for fifty thousand years, I wouldn’t take them as the pinnacle of military achievement.\nKAYSTE: (OFF) Enough!\nKAYSTE: You will witness the virtue of Sontaran self-sacrifice! I push the trigger and gas this chamber.\nKAYSTE: (HE OPERATES A TRIGGER. GAS HISSES FROM THE CANISTERS AND FLOODS THE ROOM)\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 145\nMEL: Ketch! Respirators!\nDOCTOR: Deep breath...\nSTETTIMER: Another egg-man! And not dead yet! (COUGHS) This mist will not keep my claws from your hide!\nKAYSTE: Arrgh, crustacean scum!\nTETHNEKA: We cannot breathe... This body is too frail...\nKAYSTE: Take that, Losturan! You may have wounded me, but I win the fight. (SLUMPS) Wounds, deeper than I thought. Must reach the\nKAYSTE: detonator...\nDOCTOR: Mel, Mr Ketch, we need to get out of here!\nKETCH: (RACING OUT, MASK) No sooner said...\nMEL: (MASK) No! Doctor, Kayste is after the detonator. We’ve got to get it!\nDOCTOR: Mel! Careful! Look at Tethneka!\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 146\nTETHNEKA: We choke... But we may break free of this form...\nTETHNEKA: (HORRIBLE GRISTLY NOISE AS MINERAL SPROUTS BURST OUT OF TETHNEKA)\nMEL: (MASK) She’s sprouting tendrils!\nDOCTOR: She must have been full of mineral dust. It’s seeking a new host. Keep clear! Only leave it one option!\nKAYSTE: Aargh! What manner of torture is this, what pierces my skin...\nMEL: (MASK) It’s got the Field-Major!\nDOCTOR: We need to leave. Now!\nKAYSTE: Must reach the detonator, must...\nMEL: (GETTING THE DETONATOR, MASK) Oh no, you don’t. — Got it!\nDOCTOR: Then run!\nKAYSTE: (HE STARTS TO LAUGH) Why do I laugh? Why... (HIS VOICE TAKES ON\nKAYSTE: THE BLOOMS QUALITY) Now, we have a new body! A new voice! Yes, we are stronger! More aggressive!\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 147\nKAYSTE: SCENE 80: INT. STAIRWELL\nKAYSTE: (KETCH IS TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR. THE DOCTOR AND MEL RACE UP THE STAIRS BEHIND)\nKETCH: (MASK) The door to the upper level. It’s jammed!\nDOCTOR: Some kind of mineral accretion! Perhaps the creatures inside have grown?\nMEL: (MASK) Shouldn’t the gas have dealt with them?\nDOCTOR: You don’t think I gave Kayste the right one, do you? It’s explosive but it’s far less lethal.\nMEL: (MASK) Now he tells me. Hold on —- (TAKES OFF RESPIRATOR; UNDISTORTED) Won't be needing that any more...\nMEL: There’s a gap at the top! Mr Ketch, can you -\nKETCH: Way ahead of you! It’s a narrow one, mind. (STRAINS AS HE\nELONGATES: HIS LIMBS)\nDOCTOR: Extraordinary!\nKETCH: (STRAINING) Here... we... go...\nKETCH: (WITH A WRENCH, KETCH LEVERS THE DOOR OPEN USING HIS ARM LIKE A\nJACK: )\nJACK: Quick, can’t hold it for long!\nDOCTOR: Mel, you first!\nMEL: OK.\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: I’l1l go through and hold it, then you, Ketch.\nKETCH: Right you are!\nKETCH: (WITH CONSIDERBALE EFFORT THEY BUNDLE THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH\nSLAMS: BEHIND THEM. KAYSTE STARTS CLAMBERING UP THE STAIRS BELOW)\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 149\nKAYSTE: SCENE 81: INT. OBSERVATION DOME\nKAYSTE: (THE DOCTOR, MEL AND KETCH RACE INSIDE. JACKSON IS THERE WITH THE THINGS. THE WHOLE PLACE HAS AN ORGANIC, BUBBLING FEEL)\nKETCH: Oh gosh. The Bloom is everywhere!\nMEL: Looks like a coral reef!\nDOCTOR: I’d guess that’s the organisms natural state.\nJACKSON: (BLOOM) Doctor. Mel. Mr Ketch.\nMEL: What’s it done to him?\nDOCTOR: We’re too late for Mr Jackson, I’m afraid.\nKETCH: Oh, Mr Jackson. I’m so sorry!\nJACKSON: Don’t be. I am part of a greater whole. Do you like what we've done with the place?\nDOCTOR: It’s lovely. But we can’t stay, Im afraid.\nJACKSON: Wait with us!\nMEL: The Field-Major’s coming!\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS! RUN!\nJACKSON: No! Stop!\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: Mel, look out!\nMEL: (YELPS) Ketch, be careful, its tendrils are everywhere...\nKETCH: Oh, my goodness me!\nMEL: Just run, you can make it!\nJACKSON: No!\nKAYSTE: Stay with us.\nKAYSTE: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 151\nKAYSTE: SCENE 82: INT. TARDIS\nKETCH: Goodness me. It’s bigger [on the ins-]\nDOCTOR: Do try to be original.\nMEL: Are we leaving them?\nDOCTOR: Kayste and Mr Jackson are beyond our help now. But the Bloom\nDOCTOR: isn’t.\nMEL: You want to help that thing?\nDOCTOR: Like I said, it’s not an inherently evil organism. It’s simply evolving the wrong way. It’s fed off the violence of the\nDOCTOR: Sontarans, so it’s ended up developing in a similar vein. It needs to recombine itself through dispersal into its dust form.\nDOCTOR: That’s the only way it'll evolve into something less aggressive...\nMEL: So how do we stop that happening?\nDOCTOR: Isn't it obvious? We blow it up. Have you still got that detonator?\nDOCTOR: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: SCENE 83: INT. BASE UPPER LEVEL\nDOCTOR: (KAYSTE AND JACKSON HAMMER THE TARDIS DOORS AS IT\nDEMATERIALISES: )\nJACKSON: (BLOOM) Do not leave us!\nKAYSTE: (BLOOM) Stay!\nJACKSON: (BLOOM) We need you.\nJACKSON: JACKSON/KAYSTE: (BLOOM) No!\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL)\nJACKSON: SCENE 84: INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: Engaging hover mode...\nMEL: Opening scanner.\nDOCTOR: There it is.\nMEL: The Blooms everywhere.\nDOCTOR: Page 153\nDOCTOR: So we’d better be quick. Mr Ketch, would you do the honours?\nKETCH: What, press the button? I’d be proud to.\nKETCH: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL)\nKETCH: SCENE 85: INT. BASE UPPER LEVEL\nKAYSTE: (BLOOM) Doctor!\nJACKSON: (BLOOM) Come b[ack! ]\nJACKSON: Page 154\nJACKSON: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 155\nJACKSON: SCENE 86: INT. TARDIS\nKETCH: And thar she blows.\nMEL: The Blooms destroyed.\nDOCTOR: Only in its current gestalt form. The combination of Kayste, Jackson, Tethneka and whatever other bits of Sontaran and\nDOCTOR: Losturan it found lying around...\nMEL: Now it can recombine into a different form.\nDOCTOR: Silicone-based life is usually pretty resilient. Floating around as a few clouds rather than creating nasty inter-species\nDOCTOR: hybrids will give it time to “cool off”, I think.\nKETCH: Hey. I’m an inter-species hybrid. I turned out alright.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I suppose you did.\nMEL: Looks like it’s dispersing already.\nDOCTOR: Into new clouds. New shapes. Part mineral, part tentacle, part plant.\nMEL: I think we’re witnessing the birth of a new species.\nKETCH: A better one?\nDOCTOR: It might take on the better parts of the species it’s observed. But we can’t be certain.\nMEL: So was leaving it to chance really a good idea?\nMEL: TERROR OF THE SONTARANS by Dorney & Starkey (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR: Life is always a good idea, Mel. Chance has done pretty well for most species. Far be it from me to be judge, jury and executioner.\nMEL: I suppose. (BEAT) It does look rather beautiful.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It does.\nDOCTOR: So. Mr Ketch. Where can we drop you off?\nDOCTOR: THE END"
