I’m afraid my need for information was rather urgent.\nCONSTANCE: So is my Wrens’ need for sleep. How can they do their jobs properly if they are exhausted? You boffins sometimes forget. My ladies are not simply tools. They are human beings!\nDOCTOR: Sylvia has shown a particular aptitude.

If we all abide by the proper channels, the work will be more efficiently performed.\nDOCTOR: Allow me a word of explanation.\nCONSTANCE: Dr Smith?\nDOCTOR: There is a particular reason. A particular urgency to the messages I am tracking. Most secret and most important.\nCONSTANCE: Secret? Everything that goes on here is secret.\nDOCTOR: This is even more secret than that. And I would welcome your assistance.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 11\nCONSTANCE: Go on.\nDOCTOR: There are certain phrases. Key words I need to watch for. I’ve followed every mention of ‘golden eggs’, and they seem to coincide with a particular agent’s movements.\nCONSTANCE: Who?\nDOCTOR: Agent Spark.\nCONSTANCE: (RECOGNISING NAME) Spark, you say?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Anything related to him. Or golden eggs. I’d appreciate it if you could have your ladies look out and keep me informed.\nCONSTANCE: (HIDING RECOGNITION) Agent Spark... Yes. Yes, of course, Dr Smith. Any assistance I can provide. Within reason.\nDOCTOR: Within reason. Thank you, Mrs Clarke. It’s good to have you on board.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT.

Only what I deserve, ain’t it?\nSCHWARTZMANN: You’ve done well so far, Agent Spark.\nFLINT: Please. Call me Robbie. Or Mr Flint. We’re on good enough terms. I call you Dr Schwartzman after all.\nSCHWARTZMANN: You are not so stupid to think this is my real name?\nFLINT: (DARK) Don’t call me stupid.\nSCHWARTZMANN: No. I know you better than that. Perhaps I chose the wrong word. Please. Mr Flint. Be seated.\nFLINT: You've another job for me?\nSCHWARTZMANN: You have proved your worth, since we extracted you from the Paris penitentiary.\nFLINT: It was a fit-up. I never robbed no-one. All the Frenchies’ misunderstanding. Couldn’t speak the lingo back before the war, you see.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Whereas now you are fluent in several.\nFLINT: I get by.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 13\nSCHWARTZMANN: No. Since we took control of the city and commuted your sentence, your time here at the chateau has been a good investment. Languages. Combat. Radio technique. You operate our cipher machines with skill. And of course, you have a talent with explosives.\nFLINT: Had a head start on that. Used to be the best safe-cracker in Bermondsey back in the thirties. You want a box opening, you come to Robbie Flint.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Your criminal past is behind you. You serve the Reich now.\nFLINT: Got to admit. Mr Hitler’s treated me better than any beak in Blighty.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Kindly do not refer to the Fuhrer in such casual terms.\nFLINT: Sorry, Dr Schwartzmann. No disrespect meant.\nSCHWARTZMANN: As I say. Your explosives expertise will be useful in your next\nSCHWARTZMANN: mission.\nFLINT: Going on a trip, am I?\nSCHWARTZMANN: I am arranging passage. You remember your parachute training?\nFLINT: Like falling off a log.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Good. But this time, you will not be going alone.\nFLINT: Oh.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (CALLING) Mr van Nyman?\nDUTCH: ENTERS\nFLINT: Ah, right. The Dutchman.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 14\nDUTCH: Hello Mr Flint. I’ve heard a lot about you.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Get to know one another. Very soon, you will rely on each other to stay alive.\nFLINT: (SHAKING HANDS) Nice to meet you, Dutch.\nSCHWARTZMANN: We expect to drop you in within the month. Rest. Prepare. I\nSCHWARTZMANN: shall send a message when your means of entry is ready.\nFLINT: We'll be waiting. Drop of the old vino, Dutch?\nDUTCH: A good idea, Mr Flint.\nFLINT: POURS ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Do not let me down. Germany expects.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT. BLETCHLEY\nBUSTLING: ‘CAMPUS’ ATMOS B/G. VEHICLES PULLING UP. MARCHING TROOPS IN GROUNDS. WRENS WATCHING, WHISPERING. CONSTANCE OPENS DOORS OF MAIN BUILDING.\nCONSTANCE: (EXITING BUILDING, CALLING) So this where you all are. Come along ladies. Teatime is over.\nSYLVIA: We just wanted to see what the fuss was all about.\nCONSTANCE: APPROACHES.\nCONSTANCE: There is no ‘fuss’. Simply a detachment from Whitehall visiting the Mansion. No need to stand and gawp. I’m sure they can get on without an audience. Off you go now.\nSYLVIA: Yes ma’am. Sorry ma’am.\nSYLVIA: SYLVIA AND OTHER WRENS MOVE OFF.\nHARRIS: (APPROACHING) Leading Wren Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, sir!\nHARRIS: Good. I recognise you from your file. Major Harris.\nCONSTANCE: Good afternoon, Major Harris, sir. (WORRIED) My... file?\nHARRIS: See to it the staff carry on as normal. I want to minimise any disruption. The offices are in there?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, sir. I’m afraid Director Travis was called to London.\nHARRIS: I know. I’m carrying out certain tasks on behalf of Military Intelligence in the old man’s absence.\nCONSTANCE: Military Intelligence? Is this to do with the new radio mast?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 16\nHARRIS: This has no connection with Mr Churchill’s plans. Whatever they may be. The Prime Minister’s strategy is underway under the auspice of...?\nCONSTANCE: Colonel Chambers is overseeing the installation.\nHARRIS: You will be informed of your role when the time comes, I’m sure.\nCONSTANCE: Yes sir.\nHARRIS: In the meantime. I am here for a rather different duty. (CHECKS PAPERS) Hut Twelve-A. Your group’s been working there? For Smith?\nCONSTANCE: Yes. My girls are on rotation along with Leading Wrens Huxtable, Mason, and Foster’s ladies. We’re all stationed over at Wavendon House.\nHARRIS: Good. Director Travis has placed rooms in Block G at my disposal. While he’s away, I have authority. My men have already started interviews with your people.\nCONSTANCE: Might I ask why-\nHARRIS: You know better than that, Wren Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: Of course, sir. Sorry, sir.\nHARRIS: The senior staff I will question myself. (BEAT) So. That includes you. You’re free for half an hour?\nCONSTANCE: Me? Now, sir?\nHARRIS: No time like the present, eh? Follow me.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nSORTING: THROUGH MESSAGES.\nDOCTOR: You’ve done well, Sylvia. Very well indeed.\nSYLVIA: LOOKS AT PAPERS.\nSYLVIA: Agent Spark has appeared with increased regularity the past few weeks. No more mention of golden eggs though.\nDOCTOR: Any clue we can get. Any clue at all. And I might not be so... stuck.\nSYLVIA: Stuck?\nDOCTOR: Believe it or not, Miss Wimpole. It was not my intention to stay here so long. I never normally do. And I usually avoid displaying too prominent a profile.\nSYLVIA: They say your evening wear was somewhat... colourful when you arrived.\nDOCTOR: It sometimes pays to blend in. This time, however, I’ve been left with no choice. Left with nothing, except for sifting through these ciphers. (SOTTO) While my poor old Ship’s as dead as a dodo, that is...\nSYLVIA: Sir?\nDOCTOR: Don’t mind me, Miss Wimpole. Routine engenders melancholy. I’m simply looking for an escape.\nSYLVIA: Escape... from what, sir?\nDOCTOR: From history.\nTIPS: PAPERS ONTO DESK.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, BLOCK G\nHARRIS: WRITES NOTES THROUGHOUT.\nHARRIS: Nyasaland eh? They’ve been trying to shake off colonial rule for years.\nCONSTANCE: They didn’t give us any trouble. My father was happy there. Until... the end.\nHARRIS: (CHECKING PAPERS) Ah, yes. Tuberculosis — that’s what did for him, eh?\nCONSTANCE: It was a difficult time. But we got through it. I was still young. I returned to London when my father passed. Completed my schooling. You know the rest.\nHARRIS: Somerville. Modern languages... et cetera, et cetera. (LOOKS UP) You can relax, Mrs Clarke. No more questions. Four years at Bletchley Park. You’ve seen a lot, I imagine. I’m sure for you, this will all be routine.\nCONSTANCE: Yes sir. Of course sir. (BEAT) Have I answered everything to your satisfaction?\nHARRIS: All seems to be in order, yes... One more thing. Is the code-name ‘Agent Spark’ familiar to you?\nCONSTANCE: I’m aware of his activities. (BEAT) Dr Smith has a special interest in him.\nHARRIS: (MAKING A NOTE) I see.\nCONSTANCE: So you’re looking for someone with a particular connection?\nHARRIS: Curiosity. That’s something noted on your file. Capability too.\nCONSTANCE: Forgive me, but... you’re here for a reason, Major Harris. If I can help, I’d like to.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 19\nHARRIS: It’s no great secret to tell you that... someone’s credentials have been questioned. More than that, I cannot say.\nCONSTANCE: I shan’t pry. (BEAT) You are party to lots of information, I imagine.\nHARRIS: Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: My... husband.\nHARRIS: (CHECKING FILE) Lieutenant Commander Henry Clarke. Naval Intelligence. Posted to special duties last November.\nCONSTANCE: You see, I haven’t heard a thing since the start of the year.\nHARRIS: If he’s working under cover...\nCONSTANCE: He’d send a note. Something. Just to let me know he’s still alive.\nHARRIS: Depending on his circumstances, that might not be possible.\nCONSTANCE: But what if his circumstances are... fatal?\nHARRIS: I’m afraid I can offer you nothing new Mrs Clarke. Not at present.\nCONSTANCE: Thank you sir. I’m sorry sir. I just had to ask.\nHARRIS: I understand. The War requires sacrifices from us all. But we mustn’t forget, we’re still human.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR: SPREADS PAPERS OVER DESK.\nDOCTOR: (TAPPING ON A PAGE) This is it. He’s coming here. Tonight!\nSYLVIA: How can you be sure, Dr Smith?\nDOCTOR: Agent Tulip. Henrick Van Nyman. He’s known to British intelligence.\nSYLVIA: I see. (CHECKING PAPERS) And these messages place Spark and Tulip... together.\nDOCTOR: They were about to take a holiday. As of... (CHECKS PAPERS) yesterday. They arrive this evening.\nSYLVIA: You think you might send someone to intercept them?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think we can do better than that. (PUSHING PAPERS ACROSS DESK) Here. Check the map reference.\nSYLVIA: Cambridgeshire. I know it.\nDOCTOR: Fetch Mrs Clarke would you, Sylvia.\nSYLVIA: Sir?\nDOCTOR: I can’t have you drive us off to Cambridgeshire without her say-so, can I?\nSYLVIA: Me? Drive you, sir?\nDOCTOR: Your Leading Wren is quite formidable. I’d much rather have her on my side. Chop-chop, Miss Wimpole. See if you can rally a few strapping lads as well.\nSYLVIA: Beg pardon, sir?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: We just need them to carry my ‘police box’ downstairs. You and I and Wren Clarke will take it along. It contains specialist equipment. (SOTTO) And if there’s the slightest chance of getting any of it working again...\nSYLVIA: I wondered what it is you keep in there.\nDOCTOR: Highly advanced radio receivers, transmitters, decoders. That kind of thing.\nSYLVIA: (EXITING) I’1ll round up some boys.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Oh yes, my TARDIS is full of technological wonders. But at present, they’re all completely and utterly useless.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, BLETCHLEY\nHARRIS: TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.\nHARRIS: I think it’s quite clear sir. He’s offered every excuse to avoid an interview. He could hardly be more blatant.\nINDISTINCT: BURBLE ON PHONE.\nHARRIS: Dr John Smith. No credentials. His identity evaporates as soon as one examines it too closely.\nHARRIS: BURBLE ON PHONE.\nHARRIS: No, I do not need to refer it to the Prime Minister’s office. I am quite capable of reaching my own conclusion. And that conclusion is the man’s a spy.\nHARRIS: BURBLE ON PHONE.\nHARRIS: I don’t know how he hoodwinked the authorities to get in here. Swanning around like he owns the place by all accounts. Talked Travis into giving him a room at the Main House. One of Tiltman’s old offices. Upstairs. Not only that, but he’s seconded one of the huts. Redesignated it Twelve-A.\nHARRIS: I shall be recommending a formal review of procedures here. As for how to deal with this Dr Smith. The usual form for a spy.\nHARRIS: Questioned and shot. If he resists, the questions may have to\nHARRIS: be foregone.\nHARRIS: BURBLE ON PHONE.\nHARRIS: Of course I'll do it discreetly. Minimal presence. No point\nHARRIS: startling the geese. Expect to hear from me in an hour. Then I’m off to the country. I’ve that other matter to attend to.\nREPLACES: PHONE RECEIVER ON CRADLE. GETS UP, LOADS REVOLVER.\nHARRIS: (CALLING) Captain Walters! With me.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT.

I need a vehicle.\nCONSTANCE: So I’ve been told. If you fill out the usual requisition forms...\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) There’s no time for that!\nCONSTANCE: We must follow procedure.\nDOCTOR: Procedure be blowed! I have made a breakthrough and speed is of the essence.\nCONSTANCE: Sir, I-\nDOCTOR: I have located agents with knowledge that may be key to the security of the world.\nCONSTANCE: The world? You mean the country, surely?\nDOCTOR: I know what I mean. Sometimes, we need to bypass official procedures. If there’s an urgency. If we can save lives. SO please, Mrs Clarke — the truck?\nCONSTANCE: GOES TO DOOR AND OPENS IT.\nCONSTANCE: (STOPPING) One thing, sir. Is Agent Spark involved?\nDOCTOR: Agent Spark is more vital than any of you realise. And if we’re to have any hope of catching up with him, we need to leave now. I’ll bring the maps and this... device when I’ve finished building it. I’ll meet you at the gate in five minutes.\nCONSTANCE: Yes sir! (EXITS, CLOSING DOOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT.

They haven’t seen what I’ve seen,\nHARRIS: Captain.\nCAPTAIN: This is the one, sir.\nCAPTAIN: THEY ALL STOP. HARRIS HAMMERS ON DOOR.\nHARRIS: (CALLING) Open up, Dr Smith.

Break it down boys.\nHARRIS: HARRIS AND MEN STARTS BATTERING THE DOOR — CONTINUES THROUGH.\nDOCTOR: PUSHES WINDOW FULLY OPEN AND STARTS CLIMBING OUT.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) I believe I have the solution.

Sorry sir.\nHARRIS: He simply drove off through the back gate while we were knocking at his door?\nCAPTAIN: It looks that way, sir. Wren Clarke was with him. She cleared it with the sentry.\nHARRIS: Under duress, no doubt. The scoundrel. Well, does anyone know where he’s going?\nCAPTAIN: Sorry sir, we think the only people who have any idea... well, he’s taken them with him!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: INT.

Anything from that device of mine?\nCONSTANCE: Nothing yet. What’s it supposed to do?\nDOCTOR: You’1l know when it does it.\nSYLVIA: It’ll be dark soon. We shouldn’t be out on the road during Blackout.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid the agents of the German Abwehr don’t keep office hours. Needs must. Mrs Clarke, hand me that torch. I need to check where we are on the map...\nCONSTANCE: I already did, Doctor. We’ll be at that reference very soon.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23: EXT.

You’re the expert at.. what is it? Making cheese?\nDUTCH: I’ll be glad when we are finished working together Mr Flint. Your humour is sometimes abrasive.\nFLINT: When we’re done here, I’ve got to go see a man about a dog. You clear the camp.\nDUTCH: You want to see a dog?\nFLINT: It’s an expression. Half an hour.\nDUTCH: Half an hour where though?\nFLINT: It’s a big dog. If I didn’t know better, I’d think you’d been sent along to nursemaid me. You wouldn’t be doing that would you? Spying on a spy?\nDUTCH: Get on with your job, English. Once the factory blows up, I will report back and everyone will be happy.

As far as Jerry’s concerned, they’re in the dark about Bletchley. No idea what goes on in there. Nor have I for that matter.

I’ve certainly got nothing like this set up back at Whitehall.\nDOCTOR: (OPENING ROUNDEL PANELS AND SEARCHING) Well, at the moment, I don’t have that much more to offer.\nCONSTANCE: This ship... It’s a marvel.\nDOCTOR: Normally I’d agree. But today, well, I can probably pick up the Home service, but that’s about all. Odd, but the last thing she did before she gave up the ghost, was pick up a low frequency radio signal...\nFLINT: You think you can tune into this?\nPOD: STARTS EMITTING RADIO STATIC AS BEFORE.\nDOCTOR: If it’s radio-emitting, perhaps. Now where was it... Let me see. Ah-ha! (TAKES CROWBAR AND CROSSES TO CONSOLE)\nSTATIC: INCREASES, ALIEN TRANSPONDER BEEPING FAINTLY.\nFLINT: Here. It seems to want to say hello. (HOLDS OUT POD TO DOCTOR)\nDOCTOR: (CROUCHES UNDER CONSOLE) Hold on to it for now, Mr Flint. Now if I can just get this panel off... (STARTS CROWBARRING AT TARDIS\nPANEL: COVER)\nCONSTANCE: (CROUCHING) Here. Let me help.\nDOCTOR: (PULLING AT CONSOLE BASE PANEL) Wren Clarke. You seem to have recovered your composure. What do you make of my ship?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 56\nCONSTANCE: (HELPING TO PULL PANEL OFF) I’ve seen some things in my time at Station X. But this. (EFFORT) I’1l never cease to be amazed at what Britain can achieve with an ounce of gumption and a modicum of application.\nCONSTANCE: DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE WRENCH OFF CONSOLE BASE PANEL.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. BRITANNY COAST ROAD, NEAR JETTY\nDOCTOR WHO: SEA AND GULLS, OFF. SOLDIERS MARCH UP. HALT.\nUNGER: (CALLING, OFF) Dr Schwartzmann? We are ready to go.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (CALLING) I need to deal with this matter Kapitan. It will not take long. (WALKS OVER TO THREE SOLDIERS) Now, when I began this journey in Berlin, five days ago, I had a certain number of items in my possession. Golden eggs. That number is now one less.\nSCHWARTZMANN: HE STOPS.\nSCHWARTZMANN: My deductions have narrowed the culprit down to one of you three men. You have been searched to no avail. You have passed it on to an accomplice. Yet you all deny involvement. (BEAT) You, Ensign. As the senior officer, you have allowed my property to be stolen. Whether this is due to complicity or stupidity, I cannot afford either on my staff.\nSHWARTZMANN: TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND COCKS IT.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Have the others shot. Or I’1l do it myself. (BEAT)\nSCHWARTZMANN: Nothing to say? You do it willingly, or you do it reluctantly. Would you prefer the men looked on you with fear or with pity? I am offering you an opportunity here. (CLOSE) You do not wish to take it. Very well.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: EXT. SUBMARINE DECK, BY JETTY (CONTINUOUS)\nWAVES: LAP AT SUBMARINE.\nLIEUTENANT: Are we leaving Captain?\nUNGER: We are just waiting for Dr Schwartzmann.\nTHREE: SHOTS, OFF.\nLIEUTENANT: Sir, we have barely enough to man the ship.\nSCHWARTZMANN: APPROACHES FROM OFF\nUNGER: Those were his orders. Minimal crew. Get below, Lieutenant.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (ARRIVING ON JETTY) Captain Unger. I believe I have everything\nSCHWARTZMANN: I require.\nUNGER: Your escort?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Will not be joining us.\nSCHWARTZMAN: CLIMBS ONTO DECK.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Shall we depart?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. TARDIS\nCOMMUNICATION: POD’S RADIO STATIC AND LOW PULSING AS B/G. DOCTOR\nUSES: CONTROLS, WITH NO RESPONSE — SOUNDS OF PULLING LEVERS,\nPRESSING: SWITCHES, BUT NO BEEPS.\nDOCTOR: It works. That signal. With your little souvenir wired into the TARDIS, she’s got some small part of her vision back.\nHARRIS: Her vision?\nDOCTOR: This ship — my ship — has been disabled ever since I arrived on your planet.\nCONSTANCE: Our... planet?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The TARDIS was a tractor stuck in the mud. A fly trapped in amber. Completely and utterly disabled. Every system, every readout. It took me several hours just to get the door open.\nFLINT: I’ve had days like that.\nDOCTOR: That final, VLF signal was a clue. A string of nonsense. Numbers and letters.\nCONSTANCE: Like a code?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. The TARDIS was telling me something had scrambled her systems. Something in the ether. A radio signal. A code. So, where better to track coded signals than at Bletchley? Thousands of messages every day, all indexed, punched, cross- referenced and filed.\nHARRIS: How on Earth did you get in? All the security measures... the checks and protocols.\nDOCTOR: I have my methods. And friends in high places, though I'd rather not bother them at this crucial time.\nHARRIS: Is that so?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: I proved my worth by lending a hand, Major. Mr Tutte and Dr Newman had done all the hard work. They simply needed another pair of hands. So I pointed them towards Mr Flowers at the GPO.\nHARRIS: Good Lord...\nDOCTOR: Anyway, once I, and my TARDIS, were installed, I could start trying to triangulate the source of the interference.\nCONSTANCE: That’s what Hut Twelve A has been doing?\nDOCTOR: For the past few weeks, I’ve kept an eye on all the correspondence. Interference in the signals. An electromagnetic Signature. It seemed to crop up wherever these ‘golden eggs’ were mentioned.\nCONSTANCE: And Agent Spark?\nDOCTOR: It became obvious that Agent Spark’s movements corresponded to those of the eggs.\nFLINT: You have been a nosey parker. And there was me thinking I was being careful.\nDOCTOR: I decided we needed to meet. You see, my theory is that these ‘golden eggs’ are actually reconnaissance beacons.\nFLINT: They do make all kinds of strange noises, that’s for sure.\nHARRIS: Reconnaissance on whose behalf?\nDOCTOR: I believe there is an alien ship under the sea off the Brittany coast. And by alien I mean extra-terrestrial. A space-ship.\nFLINT: Aliens? You’re having a laugh! Little green men?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’ve a lot to learn... Earth’s nearest neighbours, while green, are far from diminutive in stature. Neither am I, for that matter.\nCONSTANCE: Wait.. Are you telling us.. you’re an alien, Dr Smith?\nHARRIS: That’s preposterous.\nDOCTOR: Might I remind you where you are standing? Mrs Clarke, you might assume this ship was riveted together in Sunderland, but I can assure you — the TARDIS and I hail from even further afield.\nFLINT: What, Gateshead?\nDOCTOR: No, Mr Flint. Outer space.\nHARRIS: And you’re now saying that you’ve tracked the source of these beacons to another ship from outer space... and this thing can take us there?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nHARRIS: Then I need to get some men.\nDOCTOR: No, Major. The fewer soldiers with guns the better.\nHARRIS: I insist. Mr Flint, wait here. I’1ll fetch a squad.\nDOCTOR: No. I will not be a troop carrier.\nHARRIS: (GOING TO DOOR) Then it’s an information-gathering mission. (EXITING) With security.\nHARRIS: EXITS, DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM.\nFLINT: Hold up. Don’t press anything else. Stay right there. (DRAWS GUN)\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 62\nCONSTANCE: Mr Flint? There’s no need for the gun.\nFLINT: The Major might have swallowed all that flimflam. But I like to be on the safe side. Till I know for sure.\nDOCTOR: (ITCHING TO GO) I can’t waste time. My ship’s beached, but there’s the chance of a tide. The power in your golden egg isn’t limitless. I might not get the opportunity again.\nFLINT: You heard. Stay right there by your table and lightshade. You’re going nowhere near any cockpit, steering tower, or wherever else you use to drive this thing. You too Mrs. Keep away from that other door.\nDOCTOR: Certainly. I don’t need to be anywhere else. (PRESSES\nDEMATERIALISATION: CONTROL)\nFLINT: What the ‘ell? We’re moving!\nSHAKY: DEMATERIALISATION BEGINS, FUSED WITH THE FIZZING OF THE EGG.\nCONSTANCE: Don’t shoot, Mr Flint! If we are going somewhere, then the Doctor’s the only one who can get us back!\nSHAKING: NOISY ROOM.\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Impeccable logic, Constance. Now hold on to something! I should warn you — this isn’t the TARDIS at her best!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. FIELD\nHARRIS: LEADS SOLDIERS MARCHING UP.\nHARRIS: So keep an eye on this Doctor. I have him down as a possible alien interloper. But he seems to be on our side for now.\nTARDIS: UNSTABLE DEMATERIALISATION\nHARRIS: Halt! What on Earth...?\nDEMATERIALISATION: COMPLETES.\nHARRIS: Great Scott. So that’s how it moves. What the P.M. wouldn’t give for one of those contraptions...\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL DECK\nDOCTOR WHO: PING OF SUBMARINE SONAR ONGOING\nUNGER: We are closing in. Object sighted... five hundred yards ahead.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Good. Good. This could be the break-through that turns the tide of the war.\nSCHWARTZMANN: ADJUSTS RADIO EQUIPMENT. LOW FREQUENCY PULSING.\nUNGER: We can’t usually use the radios this far down.\nSCHWARTZMANN: I have had this equipment specially made. You see these golden capsules? They were washed in all along this coastline. They are speaking to something down here. But so very low that no- one else can hear.\nUNGER: (DUBIOUS) I see. Three hundred yards...\nCREAKS: AS SUBMARINE LISTS. ALARMS START UP.\nSCHWARTZMANN: What is that?\nUNGER: (RUSHING TO INSTRUMENTS) Our ballast has suddenly increased. That just isn’t possible!\nSCHWARTZMANN: But it has happened! Are we damaged? Is your ship taking on water?\nUNGER: (CHECKING INSTRUMENTS, CONFUSED) I... I don’t know sir.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Then find out!\nLIEUTENANT: (RUNNING IN FROM CORRIDOR) Kapitan. The aft hold.\nUNGER: What about it?\nLIEUTENANT: It’s probably best you come see.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT. SUBMARINE HOLD\nCONFINED: METAL SPACE. ALARMS ONGOING, OFF. TARDIS — LYING\nHORIZONTALLY: — OPENS, DOOR SLAMMING BACK. DOCTOR CLIMBS OUT\nONTO: DECK.\nDOCTOR: Ah. (CLIMBING OUT) Aren’t you a clever old thing?\nCONSTANCE: (POKING HEAD OUT OF DOORS) Doctor. How’s that possible? Your box is lying down flat.\nDOCTOR: Here. Take my hand.\nCONSTANCE: But the floor behind me... Oh my. I feel a little giddy.\nDOCTOR: (HELPING CONSTANCE OUT) The TARDIS is very adaptable, even in her somewhat reduced circumstances. Actually. You’ve lost a few inches round the middle as well, haven’t you?\nCONSTANCE: CLIMBS OUT ONTO DECK.\nCONSTANCE: I beg your pardon, Dr Smith!\nDOCTOR: My ship. She’s shrunk to fit. (CALLING) Come along, Mr Flint. You too!\nFLINT: (CLIMBING OUT) When you’re digging out of Wormwood Scrubs, you get used to not knowing where you’1ll come up.\nFLINT: THEY WALK ON METAL FLOOR OF SUBMARINE DECK.\nFLINT: Blimey. We really have moved.\nCONSTANCE: Can you tell where we are?\nDOCTOR: No. My instruments were dead. (POINTED) But from the fact we weren’t flooded with seawater the moment Mr Flint decided to operate the door controls-\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 66\nFLINT: (INTERRUPTING) No point going somewhere if you’re not going to look outside!\nDOCTOR: A degree of caution would have been advisable! (LOOKING AROUND) I’d say we’re probably on the alien ship.\nDOCTOR: UNGER AND HIS MEN ARRIVE AT ENTRANCE TO HOLD.\nUNGER: Halt! All of you. Stay where you are.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Not the alien ship then.\nCONSTANCE: (CLOSE) Doctor, what are we going to do? Can you explain how we got here? They’re never going to believe you’re some alien from beyond the stars come to help the human race. You’ve got to invent a better cover story.\nDOCTOR: We... don’t need to.\nUNGER: You expect us to believe this gibberish?\nCONSTANCE: I don’t believe it. He’s speaking English.\nDOCTOR: No. You are speaking German.\nCONSTANCE: I took Modern Languages at Somerville College, Doctor. I can assure you I’d know if I were speaking-\nUNGER: Silence! No more of this nonsense.\nDOCTOR: It’s the TARDIS. That facility at least has started functioning again.\nCONSTANCE: What?\nUNGER: I said, silence.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: I’1ll explain later.\nUNGER: Move. All of you. Dr Schwartzmann can decide what to do. I don’t give much for your chances.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (ARRIVING) Actually Kapitan. Doctor Schwartzmann is already here.\nFLINT: (SEEING HIS LUCK’S IN) Rightio then. And aren’t I glad you are?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Mr Flint? You do crop up in the most unexpected places.\nFLINT: Likewise. Everyone, meet Doctor Volker Schwartzmann. A... business acquaintance of mine.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Who is this delightful lady, and your fellow stowaway?\nFLINT: My... prisoners. Wren Clarke and Dr Smith. Delivered direct from the heart of British Intelligence. Along with their secret weapon. The Tardisk.\nDOCTOR: TAR-DIS.\nFLINT: Keep that shut, clever-clogs.\nUNGER: Dr Schwartzmann? What is going on?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Agent Spark here is one of my trusted counter-intelligence specialists. I suggest you get back to steering your vessel toward our objective. And silence those alarms.\nUNGER: Yes, sir. (EXITS)\nSCHWARTZMANN: Escort them to the bridge, Agent Spark.\nSCHWARTZMANN: EXITS.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL)\nFLINT: Page 68\nFLINT: You heard him. Move on out. (CLOSE) Play along, Doctor. I can\nFLINT: keep us all alive.\nFLINT: THE OTHERS FOLLOW ALONG CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, CLOSE) I was beginning to wonder whose on, Mr Flint.\nCLUNK: AS SUB HITS BOTTOM. ALL STUMBLE.\nCONSTANCE: (WALKING, CLOSE) Doctor? What was that?\nALARMS: ARE SILENCED.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, CLOSE) I believe that, Mrs Clarke, was the ocean.\nDOCTOR: Side you were\nDOCTOR: the bottom of\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: EXT. FIELD\nTROOPS: CLEARING UP, GETTING IN TRUCKS AND MARCHING OFF\nCAPTAIN: (OFF) All clear. Move it out!\nHARRIS: Well this is a mess and a half. As if it’s not enough for him to get away once. The blighter’s just disappeared again right from under our noses.\nSYLVIA: (MOANS, COMING ROUND) Numbers... Waves...\nHARRIS: Miss? Wren Wimpole? What do you recall?\nSYLVIA: (DAZED) The golden eggs. The goose that laid the golden eggs...\nHARRIS: She’s no good to anyone. Let’s take her back to Bletchley Park. When she’s well again we’ll see what Miss Wimpole remembers. I’m the poor devil that has to find some way to account for all of this .\nSYLVIA: (MOANS) Spark... Tulip... Criss-Cross...\nHARRIS: (SOTTO) I only hope for their sake, that you’re still on our side, Mr Flint.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL DECK\nDOCTOR WHO: FLINT, DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE ENTER. MORE GUNS ARE LEVELLED AT THEM. LOW FREQUENCY PULSING RADIO THROUGHOUT.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Have your men keep them all under observation, Captain. Now. What do we have?\nFLINT: Like I said, this one’s a Jenny.\nCONSTANCE: Get your hands off me, you filthy German spy!\nCONSTANCE: SLAPS FLINT.\nFLINT: That I am, and you never suspected! (SOTTO) Nice act, Mrs.\nDOCTOR: Let’s all calm down shall we. I’m the Doctor. Pleased to meet you. I presume we’re looking for the same thing.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (IGNORING HIM) Who are these people, Flint? And how did you get on board my submarine?\nFLINT: The gent’s one of them Government boffins. The woman, she’s his assistant.\nCONSTANCE: I am not merely his-\nDOCTOR: Constance! We have greater concerns. Not least of which is why Dr Schwartzmann here has a collection of... a dozen alien reconnaissance beacons plugged into that receiver.\nCONSTANCE: More golden eggs...\nSCHWARTZMANN: You know of them? I understood that they had appeared only in these waters. Nowhere else.\nDOCTOR: They’ve been interfering with my own equipment. But I don’t know how.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 71\nSCHWARTZMANN: I am something of an expert at... puzzles. I believe these to be otherworldly wonders that will [lead us to]\nUNGER: (INTERRUPTING) We have a contact, sir. It’s not a ship. It’s barely the size of a torpedo. It’s lying right alongside.\nRADIO: PULSING BECOMES HIGHER FREQUENCY. CRACKLES AND HISSING OF\nSTATIC: BUILD.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. I can’t help feeling that coming here might have been a bad idea.\nSCHWARTZMANN: This technology is like nothing the world has yet seen. If we can control the airwaves. If we can jam all Allied communications...\nDOCTOR: You have no idea what you’re dealing with. Even I am only beginning to grasp the faintest clue. But don’t you think it was madness to come right here to the source, completely unprepared, and carrying all these transmission pods?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Herr ‘Doctor’. I presume you are not a doctor of physics? We are hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean. Radio waves cannot penetrate here. We are safe from any threat they may pose.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid quite the opposite is true. Here, we are exposed. Here, we are insulated from all the radio waves on this planet’s surface that have so far prevented it from manifesting.\nCONSTANCE: Prevented what?\nHISSING: STATIC BUILDS AS THE WAVEFORM STARTS TO COALESCE.\nDOCTOR: That!\nWAVEFORM: (FX: HISSING RADIO DISTORT) Transmit... Transmit...\nFLINT: I can’t focus on it. It’s just waves. Waves of swirling light.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 72\nUNGER: Sir! I have it covered!\nDOCTOR: Don’t be a fool. You can’t fire your gun in here. Your bullets will pass straight though that being and into your hull.\nCONSTANCE: ‘Being’? You mean that thing’s a living creature?\nFIZZING: STATIC. MORSE DOTS AND DASHES MIXED WITH ALIEN\nTRANSPONDER: BEEPS BUILD THROUGH.\nDOCTOR: (CRIES OUT) It’s looking for a way in.

Am I right?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Waves criss-cross this planet. Interference.\nSCHWARTZMANN: What does it mean?\nDOCTOR: Up on the surface it can’t move. Too much radio traffic. Down here, the sea kept it insulated. Until you turned up ina submarine, with its communication beacons. It was able to hop on board.\nDOCTOR: (TO WAVEFORM) Explain to me, Waveform. Who are you? Where did you come from?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The war. We escaped the war.\nSCHWARTZMANN: It was with the Allies? It flees from them?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: Not your war, Schwartzmann. I imagine this one is fought ona very different plane.

Your old man. Never met him, mind. Major Harris keeps things much too cloak and dagger for that. But yeah, I’ve heard of him.

Beyond our perception. They have their own alliances... Their own enmities... Their own weapons.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Fascinating. Is it open to co-operation with the Reich? Is it ready to parlay?\nDOCTOR: It barely registers your existence! No. This creature is trapped in a range of the spectrum corresponding to our radio waves. It’s barely able to help itself.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The medium and the message. We require understanding to move between them. To escape.\nSCHWARTZMANN: It cannot move because of our radio transmissions?\nDOCTOR: Electromagnetic waves and the messages contained within them. Semantics and semiosis. It can’t separate the two. It fell to Earth, and now it’s paralysed.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Life as a form of... electrical impulse? Incredible.\nDOCTOR: What’s ‘thought’ but electrical impulses flickering across your brain? The equivalent for you would be floundering in a sea of flesh and bones. Infinite confusion.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We reached out. We reach out in every way we could, but we were not received.\nDOCTOR: Of course. It’s emitted a distress call. One that’s completely disabled my TARDIS. (REALISATION) Ha! Sand in a Messerschmitt’s engine.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 83\nSCHWARTZMANN: Now it is I who confuse meaning and symbols.\nDOCTOR: Dust in a computer circuit, leaves on the railway line. Higher technologies can be stymied by the most mundane of irritants. That’s what radio is to the Waveform. And what the Waveform’s Signal is to the TARDIS. Links in a chain. I must find a way to break that chain and release it.\nSCHWARTZMANN: We cannot allow this entity free rein in our world. It is too powerful.\nDOCTOR: No. I mean free my TARDIS. Then I’1ll take the Waveform anywhere it wishes. So long as it’s away from here.\nALARM: SOUNDS IN CORRIDOR. SUBMARINE CREAKS AND SHIFTS.\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nSCHWARTZMANN: (RUSHING TO INSTRUMENTS) We struck the ocean floor with quite some force. We are flooding.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT. SUBMARINE TUBE\nDOCTOR WHO: CHUADRI AT END OF CORRIDOR. WATER LEAKING IN, SUBMARINE ALARMS.\nFLINT: (SOTTO) Too many of ‘em that way. Back where we started...\nFLINT: CREEPS ALONG CORRIDOR TOWARDS DECK.\nDOCTOR: (OFF, INTO EARSHOT AS FLINT APPROACHES) Do you understand what I am proposing, Waveform? This vessel is crippled. You will be trapped in the sea once again unless you take my offer.\nWAVEFORM: (FX, OFF) We understand. You separate medium and message. Meaning from waves. Through understanding comes function. From function comes escape.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) I suppose that’s near enough to a ‘yes’.\nFLINT: STOPS JUST OUTSIDE.\nFLINT: (SOTTO) Sounds like someone’s got a plan.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (JUST OFF) If it is prepared to bargain.. If it has intelligence, we could still harness its power for ourselves.\nDOCTOR: (JUST OFF) Stop thinking like a soldier.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (JUST OFF) You forget Doctor whoever-you-are. I am a soldier.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL DECK (CONTINUOUS )\nFIZZING: WAVEFORM THROUGH. SUBMARINE ALARMS ONGOING OUTSIDE.\nDOCTOR: Listen, Dr Schwartzmann. What we do now has implications far beyond this war of yours.\nSCHWARTZMANN: No. I call the tune. I came here to harvest this resource. It will be done.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Another threat? Transmit! Chuadri! Come!\nCHUADRI: APPROACH.\nDOCTOR: No! No. I won’t help you if you keep destroying these humans’ lives. You know what your touch can do. If you want my assistance, you will not kill another person.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Transmission... understood. We desist from further communication. For the moment.\nDOCTOR: Hear that? Now stop waving your gun about, Schwartzmann.\nSCHWARTZMANN: You have it under control?\nDOCTOR: That’s probably an optimistic assessment. (TO WAVEFORM) Waveform. Dissolve your Chuadri! Come with me, into my ship and I’ll remove you from here.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We will compress our waveform.\nCRACKLING: RADIO WAVES AS CHUADRI DISSOLVE.\nDOCTOR: If I can get it into my ship, I’1ll try and take it away.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Wait. I am the one with a weapon here. I decide what is to be done.\nFLINT: (ENTERING) No, Dr Schwartzmann. You’re not the only one with a gun.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR: Flint? Where’s Constance?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Good. Agent Spark. Assist me. Secure the Doctor and take this creature. Pass me those ropes.\nFLINT: That’s not going to happen. First of all. You give me your gun.\nSCHWARTZMANN: What?\nFLINT: I did ask nicely. Ah well... (EFFORT AS FLINT THUMPS\nSCHWARTZMANN: )\nCRIES: OUT.\nSCHWARTZMANN: DROPS GUN AND FALLS TO FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: Good grief. You do pick your moments, Mr Flint.\nFLINT: (RETRIEVING SCHWARTZMANN’S GUN) Guess I’ve well and truly blown my cover now. Mrs Clarke’s safe, Doctor. Took a zap from one of them silver things, but she’s all right.\nDOCTOR: Show me.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (ON FLOOR) What is going on here?\nDOCTOR: (HELPING HIM UP) Dr Schwartzmann. Meet Agent Criss-cross. Flint’s not a Nazi spy. He’s a double agent. He’s been working for British intelligence all along.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT.

Thank goodness!\nCONSTANCE: DOCTOR, FLINT, SCHWARTZMANN AND CRACKLING WAVEFORM APPROACH\nALONG: CORRIDOR, SPLASHING PUDDLES OF WATER.\nDOCTOR: (COMING CLOSER) That’s it. This way. Back to my ship. Wren Clarke! How are you feeling?\nCONSTANCE: One of those Chuadri.. touched me.\nFLINT: I checked you was all right before I went to fetch help. You had a lucky escape, Mrs. Can’t have been at full power, eh Doc?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Your request. No dispersals. While we negotiated.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now, hurry. We don’t have long.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Careful with my capsules, Flint. I spent many months collecting them from these coastal waters.\nDOCTOR: They might be the key to us getting out of here. We need every one of them aboard my Ship.\nCONSTANCE: Here. Let me take some. (HELPING FLINT CARRY COMMUNICATION\nPODS: )\nFLINT: Ta. Tough little bird, ain’t you?\nCONSTANCE: It takes more than an electric shock to stop a Wren.\nCONSTANCE: THEY HURRY ON, SPLASHING THROUGH RISING WATER.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We depart. We seek the source of interference.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 88\nSCHWARTZMANN: This box of yours? How does it work?\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t. At the moment.\nFLINT: We got here, didn’t we?\nDOCTOR: That’s no guarantee we’ll get away.\nCONSTANCE: Even if we shelter inside, we’ll be stuck? On a sunken submarine?\nDOCTOR: CLIMBS ONTO HORIZONTAL TARDIS AND UNLOCKS DOORS.\nDOCTOR: I’m hoping our electromagnetic friend can assist with that. And\nDOCTOR: those eggs will help it connect. Everyone? Climb aboard!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM (CONTINUOUS )\nALL: CLIMB IN THROUGH DOORS, STUMBLING ONTO FLOOR.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (DROPPING TO FLOOR) It’s... so much bigger? How is this possible?\nDOCTOR: (HURRYING ACROSS ROOM) I thought you liked puzzles? Mr Flint. Deal with your Commandant’s bewilderment, would you?\nFLINT: It’s from outer space. And so’s he.\nCONSTANCE: And he’s on our side, Herr Schwartzmann. Remember that.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSING DOORS) I told you before, I simply do what I think is right, and am always glad of assistance from anyone who concurs. (BEAT) Though I admit, Dr Schwartzmann, I’m most certainly not on the side of your current employers.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) This machine is free from interference. We sense great power within.\nDOCTOR: And with no way to access it, I’1ll need to channel some of yours. Could you hover over that rotor, there’s a good Waveform?\nWAVEFORM: CRACKLES, TARDIS ROTOR MOVES SLIGHTLY.\nFLINT: What about these eggs?\nDOCTOR: CROUCHES AND PULLS OFF PANEL AS BEFORE.\nDOCTOR: Pass them here. (STARTS PLACING PODS IN CONSOLE BASE) Good. Now. Connecting all the beacons in series, I should be able to retrace our course to the TARDIS’s last position at Bletchley.\nCONSTANCE: But we drove your box away on a truck. It was brought in on one too, from what I recall.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Her last fully functional journey was to a lovely little spot on the Isis. I was going to go fishing. (SIGH) It seems such a long time ago now.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 90\nCONSTANCE: I thought you wanted to return to your office?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Where has the TARDIS been standing these last few months? When you get up in the morning, you leave a dent in the pillow. The TARDIS has done something similar in Earth’s electromagnetic field.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We have found the pattern. We understand something of this vessel’s means of transmission.\nDOCTOR: Just what I was hoping!\nTARDIS: ENGINES START AS BEFORE.\nCONSTANCE: This is a remarkable machine.\nDOCTOR: How do you feel about a trip to Blighty, Dr Schwartzmann?\nSCHWARTZMANN: It seems I have no choice in the matter.\nFLINT: It’s not all bad, Volker. How many Nazis get to pay a visit to the heart of British Intelligence?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. CORRIDOR BLETCHLEY\nHARRIS: WALKING ALONG WITH SYLVIA.\nHARRIS: Good to see you back on your feet, Wren Wimpole. No ill effects at all?\nSYLVIA: Not at all. Thank you Major. If anything, I feel I’ve slept for days!\nHARRIS: Well, everyone else seems to have vanished into thin air. Follow me. You can probably make sense of some of the papers in Smith’s office.\nHARRIS: THEY START UP THE STAIRS. TARDIS MATERIALISES INSIDE OFFICE, OFF.\nHARRIS: (STOPPING) What the devil? (BEAT) Good Lord. He’s back already. He’s on our side after all.\nSYLVIA: Sir?\nHARRIS: You recognise that sound, Wren Wimpole?\nHARRIS: AS THEY RUSH OFF STAIRS AND INTO CORRIDOR, THE DOCTOR’S OFFICE\nDOOR: OPENS, JUST OFF. CONSTANCE EMERGES, CLOSING DOOR BEHIND.\nCONSTANCE: (APPROACHING) Sylvia. There you are. I knew you wouldn’t be out of action for long. Now, take yourself over to Hut Nine. At the double. We need as many girls as we can muster. Everyone off break and over to Twelve-A.\nSYLVIA: Yes ma’am! (RUNS OFF DOWNSTAIRS )\nCONSTANCE: (CALLING) Bring tea and biscuits too! (BEAT) Hello Major Harris.\nHARRIS: Wren Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: (LEADING HIM OFF) This way, please, sir. We’ve a lot to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: CHECKING CONTROLS. WAVEFORM HISSING B/G.\nDOCTOR: It was a risky strategy allowing the Waveform to carry us here. But one that’s paid off, it appears.\nSCHWARTZMANN: We have somehow changed our position?\nFLINT: You wait and see, Doctor Schwartzmann!\nWAVEFORM: (FX, MORE DISTORTED ‘LOSING SIGNAL’) We will not sustain for long outside. Already, the transmissions of this world distort us.\nDOCTOR: Hold on as best you can. I’m hoping help won’t be too long coming. — Now, Mr Flint. Could you collect up all the\nDOCTOR: reconnaissance beacons? There should be a suitable container in the next room along the corridor.\nFLINT: (GOING OFF INTO TARDIS) All the eggs. In one basket. Rightio!\nDOCTOR: It’ll have to do for now. Waveform, Schwartzmann, you’re with me. Brace yourselves. You’re both in for rather a large dose of culture shock.\nDOCTOR: LEADS THEM OUT OF TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR, SCHWARTZMANN AND WAVEFORM EXIT TARDIS. WAVEFORM HISSING & CRACKLING B/G.\nSCHWARTZMANN: We... We are in England?\nDOCTOR: Look out of my window. The view’s not the best, and it’s dusk. But those trees, those fields. We could hardly be anywhere else.\nWAVEFORM: (FX, MORE DISTORT) We... distort. We require signal clarity...\nDOCTOR: Waveform. Can you hear me? You must use what power you have to analyse your surroundings and tell me. What are the strongest sources of interference? I need frequencies and direction.\nCONSTANCE: KNOCKS AND OPENS DOOR. HARRIS AND CONSTANCE ENTER WITH SOLDIERS.\nCONSTANCE: Major Harris — as requested. Sylvia’s gathering reinforcements.\nDOCTOR: Excellent work, Mrs Clarke!\nHARRIS: Doctor? What the devil have you been doing with my staff? (SEEING WAVEFORM) And what's... that?!\nDOCTOR: I am dealing with a creature beyond your sphere of experience. I believe you have more parochial matters to consider.\nHARRIS: Good Lord. Is that...?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Good evening. Major... Harris I believe? I recognise you from our photographs.\nHARRIS: But he’s a...\nDOCTOR: Dr Schwartzmann. Of the Abwehr. German Intelligence. I suppose you’1l want a word.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 94\nSCHWARTZMANN: Lovely weather for the time of year?\nHARRIS: What the deuce is going on?\nDOCTOR: It’s all very straightforward, Major. This is a Nazi spymaster. And this is an alien intelligence that’s trapped on Earth.\nHARRIS: The light... The sound...\nDOCTOR: It’s living electromagnetism. Your world is therefore infinitely confusing for it.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We are... medium... message. Numbers... signs... letters... Too much... interference.\nCONSTANCE: Thought is a form of electromagnetism. So are radio waves. This creature is trapped in a confusion of messages. Until we can untangle the two, it can’t escape. That’s what we’re about to do in Hut Twelve-A. And Hut Eleven, if we can borrow the bombes.\nDOCTOR: An excellent summary, Constance. You see, Major, the very nature of the creature disables any equipment that might serve to analyse it. My TARDIS, for instance. While the Waveform remains trapped, so does my Ship.\nHARRIS: Was that supposed to make things clearer?\nDOCTOR: Let’s keep you to more practical matters. I want to minimise the disruption. You need to keep everyone else in Bletchley inside their huts.\nHARRIS: Evening shift’s just started. Not too many will be out and about in Blackout.\nDOCTOR: Ensure it stays that way. I’1ll need to pinpoint which signals are scrambling the Waveform and decode them. Clear a route for the TARDIS, and then we can leave.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 95\nCONSTANCE: I’1ll fetch the cards from Block C. All the successful key decryptions from today. As many as we have.\nHARRIS: Captain Walters? Go with Wren Clarke. Make sure everyone's locked down as the Doctor says.\nCONSTANCE: & CAPTAIN: (TOGETHER) Sir!\nCONSTANCE: CONSTANCE AND CAPTAIN EXIT.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Key decryptions? You have decoded our ciphers? Enigma? Lorenz?\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nHARRIS: Doctor, I appreciate much of this is beyond my ken, but what on Earth do you think you’re doing bringing a Nazi agent here? (CLOSE) This puts Ultra at risk!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Whatever else is happening, I can’t allow the course of history to be affected. It’s important our guest sees nothing beyond these walls.\nHARRIS: Secure him.\nSOLDIERS: GRAB SCHWARTZMANN.\nDOCTOR: Quickly, please. And humanely. Keep him here if you like. I’1l need help as soon as I’ve pinpointed the codes that need cracking first. (WALKING) Hut Twelve-A is this way, Waveform. Send Mr Flint along with the beacons! (STOPS AT DOOR) I shan’t hold up your war for long — Major Harris, Doctor Schwartzmann.\nDOCTOR: EXITS WITH WAVEFORM.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. BOMBE ROOM, BLETCHLEY\nBOMBE: MACHINERY OPERATES, THEN HALTS. A BUZZER SOUNDS.\nCONSTANCE: We have a stop!\nSYLVIA: Yes ma’am. (READING AND NOTING SETTINGS) A — T — Z. Rotor settings for Network Nineteen!\nCONSTANCE: Excellent work. No time to rest I’m afraid. Prepare for the next one. Reset the plugs.\nWRENS: START ADJUSTING BOMBE MACHINERY. UNPLUGGING CABLES,\nSETTING: ROTORS.\nSYLVIA: (EXCHANGING PAPERS WITH CONSTANCE) That’s everything over the Bay of Biscay, ma’am.\nCONSTANCE: Thanks you. (EXCHANGING PAPERS) Now, onto the Luftwaffe. Here are the cribs for Red and for Snowdrop. (TO WREN) Wren Page, take the Biscay wheel and plugboard settings over to the Type-X girls.\nWREN: Yes ma’am!\nDOOR: OPENS, WREN DEPARTS, DOCTOR ENTERS WITH CRACKLING, HISSING WAVEFORM.\nDOCTOR: Marvellous work, ladies. We’ve an excellent hit rate the last few hours. What have we got?\nCONSTANCE: U-boat co-ordinates. Gun positions. Aircraft movements. The translators in Twelve-A seem to have built up a head of steam.\nDOCTOR: That’1ll be the TARDIS lending a hand.\nCONSTANCE: We've still got the Tunny messages to run. The ones from Berlin.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Yes.. a trickier prospect. I’ll take a look at those myself. But I’m hoping this decoded traffic will be enough to carve a path. Waveform, can you make sense of them?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The codes. They are understood. We see. We see a way between the waves.\nSYLVIA: (CALLING) All set. We’re on another run!\nBOMBE: MACHINE RESTARTS. ROTORS CLATTERING RHYTHMICALLY. THE\nWAVEFORM: HISSING FADES THROUGH FOLLOWING AS IT SLIPS AWAY.\nDOCTOR: Separating sense from the codes. The medium and the message. We can’t unscramble everything. But if the Waveform has a crib, a working hypothesis of where to begin, then our alien intelligence can complete its own analysis. Just like these machines. ‘Thinking’ machines. Your Mr Turing truly is a genius.\nCONSTANCE: I was on duty the night they made the breakthrough. Spring of ‘41. I'd not been here long. And of course, no-one said exactly what they’d done. But we knew. Suddenly, there were so many more decrypts for translation. We knew, but we never spoke a word.\nDOCTOR: A hundred and fifty nine million, million, million combinations. And that was the easy nut to crack.\nCONSTANCE: Then came Shark. Another rotor wheel on the naval Enigma.\nDOCTOR: Multiplying the possibilities. But the same principles cracked it. These magnificent bombe machines. Bletchley almost puts Logopolis to shame. Human ingenuity never ceases to amaze me.\nBOMBE: MACHINE WHIRS. WAVEFORM SOUND HAS STOPPED.\nCONSTANCE: Where did it go?\nDOCTOR: What?\nCONSTANCE: The Waveform. It was here with us. Then it... faded away.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: As quickly as we’ve been working, it may not have been enough. It could have been subsumed by the sheer volume of radio traffic in the atmosphere. (CALLING) Hello? Waveform? Are you receiving?\nCRACKLING: CHUADRI FORMS.\nDOCTOR: Ah. It’s coming through...\nBOMBE: MACHINERY HALTS. BUZZER SOUNDS.\nSYLVIA: (JUST OFF) We have a stop!\nCHUADRI: SOLIDIFIES.\nCONSTANCE: That’s not the Waveform. It’s one of those Chuadri!\nSYLVIA: (APPROACHING) One of... what, ma’am? (GASPS) There are more behind the bombes.\nWRENS: MOVE AWAY IN ALARM.\nDOCTOR: Why is it summoning them? I’m freeing the Waveform. I thought understanding was all it needed.\nCHUADRI: (FX) Message received. Awaiting transmission.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. Carry on, Sylvia! (HEADS TO DOOR) Constance, with me!\nCONSTANCE: I’m not leaving my Wrens while these creatures are threatening them.\nDOCTOR: (OPENING DOOR) They’re not. They’re standing guard. They won’t harm your ladies. Not while they’re doing its work. (GOES OUTSIDE) Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: EXT. PATHS BETWEEN HUTS, BLETCHLEY (CONTINUOUS)\nMULTIPLE: CHUADRI MATERIALISING, OFF. CONSTANCE EXITS HUT.\nCONSTANCE: (CATCHING UP) Where do you think the Waveform is?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Everywhere!\nCONSTANCE: How do we communicate with it? Find out what it’s doing?\nDOCTOR: Right now, I’ve no idea. But we can start with those pods, back in my office.\nCONSTANCE: Actually. We should stop off somewhere first. (TAKING THE LEAD) Don’t worry, Doctor, it’s on the way!\nCONSTANCE: THEY HURRY ON.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: EXT. LAKESIDE, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR WHO: RUSTLING IN BUSHES.\nEFFY: We shouldn’t be out here, Cyril. The Major said everyone should stay indoors.\nCYRIL: But this is my best chance to get you alone, Effy darling.\nEFFY: Oh Cyril!\nEFFY: THEY SMOOCH. CHUADRI START FORMING.\nEFFY: Cyril. Wait. Someone’s here. Oh. What are they?\nCYRIL: Remarkable. Silver ghosts. From thin air.\nEFFY: Is it.. them? Are we invaded?\nCHUADRI: (FX, BECOMING MORE DISTINCT THROUGH FOLLOWING) One. One. Nine. Four. Zero. Zero. Nine.\nCYRIL: No. It’s like a statue. Is it.. speaking? (APPROACHES THROUGH BUSHES) I wonder. If I... (ZAPPED BY CHUADRI) Aaagh!\nCHUADRI: (FX) These minds. Full of thoughts. Numbers. Waves.\nEFFY: Cyril! No! (TURNS TO RUN)\nANOTHER: CHUADRI WALKS FORWARD AND ZAPS HER.\nEFFY: Aaaagh!\nCHUADRI: (FX) Waves absorbed.\nWAVEFORM: (FX, AS IF VIA RADIO TRANSMISSION) We gain understanding. We are everywhere. Transmit.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE RUN UPSTAIRS AND INTO OFFICE.\nDOCTOR: Where’s Harris? Where’s Flint?\nSCHWARTZMANN: The Major seems content to leave me tied to this chair with a guard on the door. Mr Flint... vanished with my golden eggs.\nDOCTOR: The Waveform’s played me for a fool. It’s already cracked all the codes it needs.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It wanted freeing from its underwater prison. And like an idiot, I did exactly what it wanted.\nWAVEFORM: HISSES AND CRACKLES INTO EXISTENCE.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We will conquer all radio frequencies. They envelop this planet. We will ride them and disseminate our Chuadri soldiers.\nDOCTOR: Why? This world is irrelevant to you. The Earth has nothing to do with your war.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) This ‘Earth’ is a resource in that conflict. First, every electrical impulse can be absorbed.\nLIGHTNING: ZAPS SOLDIER OUTSIDE DOOR.\nCONSTANCE: The guard!\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We test human signals. The bodies do not conduct.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, you said... every thought. Every nerve signal. They contain electrical energy.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR: But it’s tiny. The amount of power the Waveform would gain from a human being is infinitesimally small.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Billions exist on this world. Moving. Thinking. Fighting. If they cannot be harnessed, we cleanse this rock of life. Then absorb power from the electromagnetic fields that cross it.\nPANICKING: CRIES OF ALARM OUTSIDE. CONSTANCE RUSHES TO WINDOW.\nCONSTANCE: What’s happening out there?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We must expand our range.\nCHUADRI: MANIFESTING OUTSIDE. GUNSHOTS. CRIES.\nCONSTANCE: (LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW) There are more Chuadri appearing in the grounds, Doctor.\nGUNFIRE: OUTSIDE.\nDOCTOR: It’s no good fighting. We need to use our heads. (GOING TO\nUNTIE: SCHWARTZMANN) Here, Schwartzmann, let’s get you untied.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (BEING RELEASED) Thank you. I suppose it is too much to ask for the return of my weapon to defend myself? (FREED, HE STANDS)\nDOCTOR: Yes. In any case, it won’t do much good.\nCONSTANCE: I’ll find Major Harris. Tell him to pull the men back inside.\nCONSTANCE: OPENS DOOR. FLINT BLOCKS HER WAY.\nFLINT: (ENTERING) Whoah! Hold up, Mrs. Where you hurrying off to? Did I miss the start of the party?\nDOCTOR: (PREOCCUPIED) How? The Waveform could only make headway if it knew ciphers from both sides. If it’s been able to decode a proportion of the signals from the start. How did it gain that knowledge?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 103\nSCHWARTZMANN: Ha! You are betrayed, I think. It is obvious, is it not?\nCONSTANCE: Yes. Of course. Of course it is. (BEAT) What did they promise you? Mr Flint.\nFLINT: (DRAWS GUN) Nothing much. Just mastery of the whole world. Sort of puts Dr Schwartzmann’s and Major Harris’s payments in the shade.\nDOCTOR: Agent Criss-Cross.\nFLINT: Hande hoch — Doctor, Mrs Clarke!\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Our signals attuned to this human’s mind. We ratified our agreement beneath the sea.\nFLINT: You might say, we’re on the same wavelength.\nDOCTOR: You'd really do this? Betray your whole species? Your whole planet?\nFLINT: If I get to run it. Yeah. Why not?

DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR WHO: HISSING OF WAVEFORM B/G.\nFLINT: (MOANS, RECOVERING) Got what you needed?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We process the decryptions. Your brain is unharmed.\nFLINT: Urgh. Don’t feel like it. (RUBS HEAD) We won’t be doing that again in a hurry. Will we?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) These codes remain constant for one day?\nFLINT: That’s right. They’1ll change again at midnight.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We will not need that long. Soon our Chuadri manifest once more.\nFLINT: You reckon you can finish this today?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We detect which wavelengths are most vital. We consume the Signals. Signals we use to build our army. We will spread across this sphere as frequencies fall under our control.\nFLINT: You reckon you’1ll have a big enough army to take down the Germans? The Brits? The Russians and the Yanks?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The Chuadri will be without number once every field of the spectrum is ours.\nFLINT: Then I get to run things, right?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) You will be the modulator of the harvest of planet Earth.\nFLINT: ‘Modulator’? Sounds a bit poncey. Can’t I just be King? Or Emperor, maybe?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 113\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We warn you, Emperor Flint, most humans will not survive. Few will remain for you to rule.\nFLINT: (CHUCKLES) ‘Emperor Flint’. Like it. That’s all right, me old mucker. Never been big on making friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: INT. HUT TWELVE-A, BLETCHLEY\nOCCUPANTS: SCRIBBLING ON PAPERS. HARRIS KNOCKS, ENTERS AND\nCLOSES: DOOR.\nHARRIS: All quiet. No sign of those silver blighters. Yet.\nCONSTANCE: Everyone’s indoors?\nHARRIS: Yes. I’ve put a temporary stop on traffic in or out. There’s already a half-dozen despatch riders at the gate.\nDOCTOR: We need to deal with this quickly. I can’t let it affect history. Your war goes on, but we’ve got to win this one first...\nHARRIS: My men report Flint’s holed up in your office. We could storm it-\nDOCTOR: No. He’s got the Waveform on his side.\nSCHWARTZMANN: At close range, it takes human beings apart.\nCONSTANCE: We are defeating it with something more than brute force.\nHARRIS: What about your police box? Your... ship?\nDOCTOR: Still mired in the Waveform’s signal. I have all I need right here. The fewer people who know what we’re doing the better.\nHARRIS: So now we wait. (BEAT) You couldn’t brew up some tea, Miss Wimpole?\nCONSTANCE: Pardon, Major?\nSYLVIA: Yes, sir.\nCONSTANCE: No — as you were, Sylvia. Major, do you have a mathematical degree?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 115\nHARRIS: Well, I, er...\nCONSTANCE: Do you have a first from Oxford in Modern Languages?\nHARRIS: I speak French, and bit of German-\nCONSTANCE: It’s not just words. It’s a mindset. Transferring meaning from one set of symbols to another. Can you do that?\nHARRIS: No.\nCONSTANCE: Well those who can need tea. Brew it yourself. Sir.\nDOCTOR: Actually, Major, you can accompany me. There’s a task I have in mind.\nSYLVIA: I was thinking, Doctor. Couldn’t you send an order? If it’s using radio waves for power, then we could stop them. Order radio silence. Just a short while. Dr Schwartzmann, you could ask too.\nSCHWARTZMANN: (SCORNFULLY) You think German High Command would listen?\nDOCTOR: No. The worst thing we could do now is disrupt radio traffic. History must take its course. Any interference would be catastrophic. (SIGH) At least the whole thing will be over this time next year.\nCONSTANCE: The whole... sorry, what?\nDOCTOR: Erm. Forget I said that. Even a temporary halt to transmissions would endanger the war’s outcome.\nCONSTANCE: You just said, the end of the war was coming. Next year?\nDOCTOR: We'll live to see next year. That’s what I meant. — Major. Are you ready?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 116\nHARRIS: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Bring that big metal doorstop would you? (EXITING) I’1l need to get past any newly-formed Chuadri at the Mansion.\nHARRIS: (PICKING UP LARGE MAGNET) With a doorstop?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: EXT. OUTSIDE BLETCHLEY MANSION\nDOCTOR WHO: HARRIS AND DOCTOR APPROACH MANSION CAUTIOUSLY, TAKING COVER IN\nFOLIAGE: AS PLANES PASS OVERHEAD. USE HUSHED TONES.\nHARRIS: There they go. Goodness knows where Jerry’s set his sights tonight.\nDOCTOR: There are messages out there that could tell you. We need to get Bletchley back to work.\nHARRIS: I could try what the girl suggested, Doctor. Order radio blackout.\nDOCTOR: No, you can’t. Ultra is vital. Especially now.\nCRACKLING: CHUADRI FORM IN GROUNDS.\nDOCTOR: The foot-soldiers are returning. It must be making progress with the codes.\nHARRIS: If we can’t beat this thing. If it starts to gain the upper hand... There are alternatives. A bombing run. On our own soil. There'd be ways of making it look [like-]\nDOCTOR: No! It can’t come to that. You’ve no idea how important this place is.\nHARRIS: We may not have a choice.\nDOCTOR: Then we’d better get on with it. Get rid of any extra- terrestrial interference in good time for Overlord.\nHARRIS: Good grief. How do you-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) The same reason I know about the aerial mast being installed at Hut Eighteen. I told you before: friends in high places. One friend in particular.\nHARRIS: I did wonder.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR: You and your men have your assignment. Dismantle that equipment and run a loop right around the perimeter. Wrens Clarke and Wimpole will do the rest with the message I gave them to encode.\nHARRIS: I still don’t understand your part, Doctor. Strolling into the lion’s den? Flint and that creature won’t leave your office. They won’t let you near your TARDIS. What do you hope to achieve?\nDOCTOR: GETS UP, WALKING TOWARDS MANSION.\nDOCTOR: I’m simply doing what I came here to do in the first place, Major. I’m going fishing.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nHISSING: WAVEFORM B/G\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Transmitting. Radius expanding. Two miles. The codes are elaborate but we receive them.\nCHUADRI: MATERIALISE OUTSIDE.\nFLINT: Good-oh. Our silver army’s back in business. The rest of the world won’t know what hit it.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Something slows us. Obstructs our view. Listen.\nBEEPING: TELEPRINTER SIGNALS EMERGE FROM STATIC.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) More complex signals. Help us decipher them.\nFLINT: I don’t know what that is. Sounds different from my box of tricks.\nDOCTOR: (AT DOORWAY) That’s the Lorenz. German High Command’s coded teleprinter signal.\nFLINT: You what?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (STROLLING INTO ROOM) British Intelligence has never seen one, but they built the Tunny to replicate its operation. Twelve rotors. More letters. Billions of combinations. It’1ll take you a little longer to decrypt. That’s why Bletchley built Colossus.\nFLINT: Oi. What are you doing here? How’d you get past our guards?\nDOCTOR: My magnetic personality. Well. A large enough magnet to stun them. But look. (PLACES MAGNET ON TABLE) I’m giving it up. I come in peace.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 120\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We will disperse your signals.\nCRACKLING: STATIC.\nDOCTOR: Wait! I came to talk.\nFLINT: The Waveform’s done with you, Doctor. It’s my turn now.\nDOCTOR: On the contrary, Mr Flint. I’m here to see you. To beg an audience with the ruler of the world in waiting.\nFLINT: Nah. You just want your police box.\nDOCTOR: (DISMISSIVE) Oh, no. My TARDIS is as good as useless. I am here to appeal to you as a fellow human being. Well, near enough.\nFLINT: What’s your game? Are you hidin’ something?\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The Doctor conceals no devices.\nDOCTOR: We could save the people, Flint. Your people. Wouldn’t you rather rule as a hero than a tyrant?\nFLINT: I dunno. Caviar tastes the same either way. How can I save ‘em?\nDOCTOR: The Waveform can absorb what it needs from the Earth. Persuade it to spare the people. There are many potential energy sources. There are machines here that can calculate- (BREAKS OFF) No. I’ve said too much.\nFLINT: Don’t matter. Sounds like too much trouble to me. I’1ll stick with the original plan.\nDOCTOR: You really have no moral scruples at all, have you Mr Flint?\nFLINT: Got me where I am today.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: And where’s that? Do you think this war’s made you a hero? Just because you can play one side off against the other? Or are you simply a self-serving sociopath, who’s found a comfortable niche while all around him burns?\nFLINT: Of the two of us Doc, I’m the one who’s gonna see the sun rise tomorrow. That puts me ahead.\nDOCTOR: With the Waveform running the show, I wouldn’t count on it.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The Doctor conceals meaning. Calculating machines?\nFLINT: Here. Hang about. It’s got a point. What’s that Colossus you were on about?\nDOCTOR: (FEIGNING IGNORANCE) Did I mention a ‘Colossus’?\nFLINT: Tell us.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We sense... electrical fields. This machine is close. These Signals can be decoded.\nDOCTOR: No, really. I don’t think it’1l be any good to you. You seem to be doing perfectly well without- (GRABBED BY FLINT)\nFLINT: (GRABBING DOCTOR) Show us.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: INT. HUT TWELVE-A, BLETCHLEY\nSYLVIA: FINISHES SCRIBBLING NOTES.\nSYLVIA: We’ve done it! The poem’s encoded. I think. I need to run it through... Hut Eleven. To test it out.\nCONSTANCE: Very good Sylvia. Be careful.\nSYLVIA: Yes, ma’am.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Might I accompany? I haven’t had stimulating work like this in a long while.\nCONSTANCE: COCKS PISTOL.\nCONSTANCE: You’1l stay where you are, sir. Off you go, Wren.\nSYLVIA: EXITS.\nCONSTANCE: We can’t let you into all our secrets. I’m going to have to tie you to your chair again, while we complete our mission.\nCONSTANCE: STARTS TYING SCHWARTZMANN.\nSCHWARTZMANN: I forget. I am the prisoner and you are the guard. The girl is bright. You have many like her?\nCONSTANCE: She’s one of the best. But yes, we have many, many like her. That’s why we’ll win the war.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Perhaps. Why not shoot me now? Your Major Harris will not let me live. I already know too much.\nCONSTANCE: It won’t come to that. We’re not brutes. You’1ll find British prisons better-appointed than your own. I expect most prisoners of war won’t have the luxuries you'd be afforded.\nSCHWARTZMANN: I sense bitterness in your tone, Frau Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: FINISHES TYING.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 123\nCONSTANCE: Do you? Need I remind you, our countries are at war? (BEAT) You’re a ranking officer in German intelligence... I’ve something I must ask...\nSCHWARTZMANN: (BITTER LAUGH) You expect me to share secrets with you simply because we share your... strange-coloured tea.\nCONSTANCE: The Carnation milk turns it orange. (BEAT) You know my name. Do you know of an agent who shares it?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: My husband. Henry Clarke.\nSCHWARTZMANN: This is a British agent? Or a double agent? (BEAT) There is a quiver in your ‘stiff upper lip’, I see.\nCONSTANCE: We may be enemies, but we’re still human beings.\nSCHWARTZMANN: You are careful not to chafe with your ropes. Very humane.\nCONSTANCE: (SIGH) Is there a Mrs Schwartzmann?\nSCHWARTZMANN: You think this is my real name? I am a Baron, no less. We have a house in Bremen. My wife. My children. My dogs.\nCONSTANCE: Why are you telling me this?\nSCHWARTZMANN: Because it does not matter. I know nothing of your husband. Officers of the Abwehr barely know one another, let alone the agents they run. Most of all, it does not matter because you will die.\nCONSTANCE: I don’t think so. What the Doctor said about next year... I’m inclined to believe him.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 124\nSCHWARTZMANN: Your Doctor said the war would be over. He did not say which Side would win.\nSYLVIA: RUSHES IN.\nSYLVIA: (BREATHLESS) It worked, ma’am. The code’s secure. Dr Smith’s\nSYLVIA: message is enciphered and ready.\nCONSTANCE: Then let’s get to work.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: INT. COLOSSUS BLOCK, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR WHO: FLINT AND DOCTOR ENTER, FOLLOWED BY WAVEFORM AND CHUADRI.\nDOCTOR: Here we are. The Colossus machine. The most powerful computer currently in existence on this planet. The only computer, in fact.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Start the machine. Break the code.\nDOCTOR: It’s a little more involved than that. Many people are required to-\nWAVEFORM: (FX) It can be done by Chuadri.\nDOCTOR: First you need to turn that electrical signal you’re picking up into a teleprinter message. This undulator does the job.\nWAVEFORM: CRACKLES, OPERATING UNDULATOR. TELEPRINTER BEEPS AND A\nSHORT: BURST OF TICKERTAPE PRINTING.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We understand the transformation.\nFLINT: It only needs to see anything once.\nDOCTOR: There are thousands of characters. You’1ll need reams of tape-\nTELEPRINTER: BEEPING. CHUADRI CRACKLE, FORMING INTO RUSTLING\nTAPE: THROUGH FOLLOWING.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) The Chuadri can also do this.\nDOCTOR: Handy things, aren’t they? Infinitely mutable energy waves. Yet you seem to use them for destruction.\nFLINT: Shut 1%\nDOCTOR: So now you’re drawing signals from the ether, printing straight onto silver tickertape. It needs feeding through the Colossus.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR: PICKS UP TAPE, LOOPS IT ROUND COLOSSUS WHEELS\nFLINT: (TAKING OVER) I can do this. Move aside, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Very well. I’11 switch on, shall I?\nCOLOSSUS: STARTS WHIRRING AND CLICKING. TAPE RUNNING THROUGH WHEELS.\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Five thousand characters a second. Millions of combinations! All those lights, they’re Boolean testing.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) More computation. More signals! More Chuadri!\nMORE: CHUADRI CRACKLE INTO TAPE.\nDOCTOR: The further afield you wish to roam, the more ciphers you’11l have to break. They’1ll change every day. Hundreds of networks, thousands of messages.\nFLINT: We won’t need to. We’1l be round the world today!\nWAVEFORM: (FX) More! Increase transmission! Increase understanding!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Tommy Flowers knew his stuff.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY\nSYLVIA: TIPTOES UPSTAIRS OUTSIDE OFFICE.\nSYLVIA: (JUST OUTSIDE) Ma’am? All clear in Dr Smith’s office?\nCONSTANCE: Yes it is, Sylvia. The Doctor did it.\nSYLVIA: (ENTERING) I’ve switched on the transmitter in the radio hut. can’t really tell if it’s working.\nCONSTANCE: We'll just have to have faith. (CRUMPLES PAPER) I’ve read the instructions he gave me. As simple as warming up a wireless set, he said.\nSYLVIA: You’1l be fine, ma’am. I’d best report back to the Major. (BEAT) How do you get inside?\nCONSTANCE: UNLOCKS TARDIS.\nCONSTANCE: He gave me a key, too. Wish me luck. I’ve no idea what this thing might do when it comes to life.\nSYLVIA: Boost our signal, the Doctor said. Complete an ultra-low frequency circuit surrounding the whole site.\nCONSTANCE: Yes. I know that’s what he said. But I’ve still no idea what it’ll do.\nCONSTANCE: ENTERS TARDIS AND CLOSES DOOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71: INT. COLOSSUS HUT, BLETCHLEY\nCOLOSSUS: MACHINE WORKING. LOW HUMMING TONE STARTS BUILDING\nTHROUGH: SCENE.\nFLINT: (OVER NOISE) Can you hear that?\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Hear what? There’s rather a noise.\nFLINT: Like a fly. Buzzing in my earhole.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Interference. There is interference.\nDOCTOR: Now you come to mention... there is something. Irritating, isn’t it?\nFLINT: Doctor. What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Me? I haven’t done a thing. I’m helping you two. Lord Haw-Haw and Caspar the friendly ghost. (BEAT) My friends, on the other hand...\nFLINT: What have you done?\nWAVEFORM: (FX, STRUGGLING) There is... interference. There are... unknowns.\nFLINT: Call the silvermen!\nDOCTOR: Your Chuadri are all a little tied up.\nLOW: FREQUENCY TONE MUCH LOUDER. DOCTOR STOPS COLOSSUS.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Transmit. Transmit!\nDOCTOR: You’re not transmitting anything. Not outside the aerial loop that’s now surrounding Bletchley Park.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) We are restricted!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR: A nice long wave. Very low frequency. I could tell, you see, from the fact you couldn’t permeate seawater. There are limits to your range.\nFLINT: You were tricking us.\nDOCTOR: Tricking? No! Distracting. Oh yes. Nothing like fifteen hundred blazing thermionic valves to occupy the attention of sentient electromagnetism.\nWAVEFORM: (FX VOICE SLOWED AND SPEEDED THROUGH) What is this noise? It distorts us. Compresses us... Slows us... Destroys us...\nDOCTOR: Once our VLF signal started blocking you, the TARDIS started working. Boosting our VLF signal. Blocking you even more. So the TARDIS grew stronger. And boosted the signal. You get the idea.\nWAVEFORM: (FX, DISTORTED) Message and medium... We must understand!\nDOCTOR: If you’re trapped, you need to break the code to get out.\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Signal... losing... integrity...\nDOCTOR: I’d hurry if you don’t want to become the longest wave in the universe. All that power. Nowhere to go. Might I suggest you retreat? (HOLDS UP POD) Inside one of these?\nFLINT: An egg. He’s got my egg!\nWAVEFORM: (FX) Decode... Decode! Flint!\nCRACKLING: INTERFERENCE AS WAVEFORM HOLDS FLINT.\nFLINT: Aaagh! Get off me!\nDOCTOR: The Waveform wants to take you along. It thinks you can break the code. Will you give it the bad news, or shall I?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 130\nFLINT: Aaargh! I don’t know. I’m telling you. He’s made it up. I don’t know!\nDOCTOR: It’s not listening...\nFLINT: It’s dragging me with it! Inside the egg! Help me! (SCREAMS,\nDISTORTED: )\nWAVEFORM: (FX, DISTORTED) Transmit... Transmit... Transmit...\nWAVEFORM: WHITE-NOISE WHOOSH, WAVEFORM AND FLINT ARE SUCKED INTO EGG. SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: Transmission ends. Over and out.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, BLETCHLEY\nHARRIS: (PACING) We have a problem it seems.\nSCHWARTZMANN: You do.\nHARRIS: The war is almost over, so the Doctor says.\nSCHWARTZMANN: I have secrets. You want me to bargain for my life? A name. Stauffenberg.\nHARRIS: I know about Stauffenberg.\nDOOR: UNLOCKED. DOCTOR ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: Major Harris? A word. Whatever his allegiances, Schwartzmann\nDOCTOR: here was instrumental in saving the world. There must be room for understanding. Mercy.\nHARRIS: He must be imprisoned. Or eliminated.\nDOCTOR: Or returned home?\nHARRIS: I’ll consider. I give you my word. He’1ll not come to harm on British soil. (WALKING TO DOOR) He can wait for now.\nDOCTOR: You do what you think right, Major. Goodbye, Dr Schwartzmann.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Goodbye, Herr Doctor.\nDOCTOR: EXITS. HARRIS FOLLOWS.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Would it help if I said I’d forgotten everything?\nHARRIS: No.\nHARRIS: EXITS, LOCKING DOOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73: INT. TARDIS\nTARDIS: COMING TO LIFE.\nCONSTANCE: What a machine. So many lights and switches. I’m sure the Doctor said that this would operate the screen... (OPERATES\nSCANNER: CONTROL )\nSCANNER: DISPLAY SHOWS SYLVIA AND HARRIS ENTERING OFFICE OUTSIDE.\nSYLVIA: (VIA MONITOR) - everyone’s back at work. We’re almost through the backlog already.\nHARRIS: (VIA MONITOR) Excellent news Wren Wimpole. That’1l keep Commander happy.\nSYLVIA: (VIA MONITOR) There’s just... one other thing, Major Harris.\nHARRIS: (VIA MONITOR) What’s this?\nSYLVIA: (VIA MONITOR) I thought you should see it.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, BLETCHLEY (CONTINUOUS)\nSYLVIA: A message. Received a few days ago. Left out of the dispatches. It’s in English, you see.\nHARRIS: (TAKES PAPER, READS) ‘Remain Constant. H. C.’ Ah. Thank you, Wren Wimpole.\nSYLVIA: I don’t want anyone to get in any trouble. It’s probably just a mistake. What with everything going on...\nHARRIS: Thank you. That’1ll be all. Arrange a car for our visitor. He needs to get to Portsmouth tout suite.\nSYLVIA: Sir!\nSYLVIA: EXITS.\nHARRIS: (TO SELF) H. C.\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS.\nHARRIS: There you are, Wren Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: Sorry sir, I couldn’t remember which was the door switch. I’d be in there all day if I waited for the Doctor.\nHARRIS: MI5 will be here in force the next few days. I’d advise you to give them every assistance on the subject of your husband.\nCONSTANCE: Sir? (BEAT) Has there been... news?\nHARRIS: No. Not exactly. But I expect there will be.. further questions. Thank you for your help, Wren Clarke. I’1ll be off.\nCONSTANCE: (DISTRACTED) Yes. I’1l1 come down with you sir. I need to fetch some things.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75: EXT. DRIVEWAY, BLETCHLEY\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND SYLVIA WALK ALONG LAKESIDE. BLETCHLEY TRAFFIC CONTINUES IN B/G — MOTORBIKES AND CARS COMING AND GOING IN DISTANCE. PEOPLE PASSING.\nSYLVIA: What was that message we encoded, sir? The verse? About the English ‘lassies’ at Bletchley?\nDOCTOR: A few lines it would never guess. With the Waveform’s own name overlaid as a cipher, to lend a maddening proximity to the solution. You know the feeling when the crossword answers are on the tip of your tongue? That’s how it’1ll feel forever. Locked in its golden egg, safe in the TARDIS. ‘Waveform’. No repeating letters, you see. A very tough nut.\nSYLVIA: It was Dr Schwartzmann’s idea to use the binary method.\nDOCTOR: And you worked it out. In your head. I’m impressed. You’re sure you don’t fancy a little trip?\nSYLVIA: No sir. Thank you sir. I’m quite happy doing my bit here, in the - how did it put it? - the ‘sodden Bletchley day’.\nDOCTOR: ‘Epitaph on Matapan to Mussolini’. I thought it seemed appropriate.\nSYLVIA: Is it a famous poem? I don’t know it.\nDOCTOR: No-one does. No-one will for a long while. (SIGHS, STOPS) Dear old Dilly Knox wrote it. He never knew how vital his work was. But one day the world will learn the truth. They’1ll realise how much is owed to all of you here.\nSYLVIA: Sorry, sir?\nDOCTOR: Churchill knows. That’s how you win a war. With the mind. Put your faith in the oddballs. Chess-players. Crossword-solvers. Give them an army of indefatigable aides. Wrens, debs, (CHUCKLE) ‘Dilly’s fillies’. Everyone plays their part. Together, you save lives. Together, you can end this war.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 135\nSYLVIA: I hope so. I.. should get back to my hut. Tea’s over. (SALUTING) Goodbye Dr Smith.\nDOCTOR: Carry on, Wren Wimpole.\nSYLVIA: WALKS OFF. DOCTOR WALKS TO MANSION HOUSE. TRAFFIC AROUND BLETCHLEY, BIKES, PEOPLE, BICYCLES IN B/G. DOCTOR STOPS AT\nMANSION: DOORWAY.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Winston’s golden geese, that never cackled. (ENTERS MANSION)\nCONSTANCE: RUNS ALONG PATH.\nCONSTANCE: (RUNNING, CALLING) Doctor! Doctor Smith! One moment!\nCONSTANCE: HURRIES INTO MANSION.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: INT. HOLD, CARGO SHIP\nSTEAMER: FOGHORN ABOVE. DOOR UNLOCKED. FOOTSTEPS\nSCHWARTZMANN: Ah. I thought I might not be permitted to get clean away. Your change of heart seemed... convenient.\nHARRIS: I can’t allow it. Whatever the Doctor thinks. There’s a war on.\nSCHWARTZMANN: You come in person?\nHARRIS: (LOADING REVOLVER) Professional courtesy.\nSCHWARTZMANN: I appreciate it. I am impressed. I did not think the British officer class quite so ruthless. I would do the same.\nHARRIS: I shan’t take that as a compliment.\nSIRENS: ABOVE. DISTANT GUNFIRE.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Ah. What route did this vessel take?\nHARRIS: We’re off the Belgian coast.\nSCHWARTZMANN: Your people are probably decoding the attack command now. Only, they will not act, so my people do not discover the code has been broken. They will sacrifice this convoy to preserve their secrets. I admire such pragmatism.\nHARRIS: What?\nSCHWARTZMANN: A wolf-pack patrols here. Last I heard, it was awaiting orders. I’ve an idea what those orders are.\nSCHWARTZMANN: EXPLOSION, METAL BUCKLING. BOTH MEN FALL. SEA STARTS POURING IN.\nHARRIS: (OVER NOISE) Dear Lord. We’re hit!\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 137\nSCHWARTZMANN: (OVER NOISE) Your gun seems rather superfluous now. You think the war will be over next year?\nMETAL: RENDS. EXPLOSIONS OFF, ABOVE. SEA ROARING IN NOW.\nHARRIS: (OVER NOISE) We’ll never know, Herr Schwartzmann. We’ll never-\nVERY: CLOSE EXPLOSION. SHIP RENDS APART AND SINKS.\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77: INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: TARDIS IN FLIGHT B/G. DOCTOR CHECKING CONTROLS.\nCONSTANCE: ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: You managed to find a suitable billet?\nCONSTANCE: I’m used to Spartan quarters. It’s all very... clean. (BEAT) Thank you, sir. For allowing me on board.\nDOCTOR: ‘Allowing’..? You practically press-ganged me into it. (BEAT) This is all very sudden, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: I.. have my reasons. And it’s Wren Clarke. Please.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS is not a military vessel. No need for rank and title.\nCONSTANCE: Erm, ‘Doctor’ ?\nDOCTOR: A civilian calling.\nCONSTANCE: And your name is not John Smith.\nDOCTOR: No.\nCONSTANCE: You may continue to address me as Mrs Clarke. I don’t think over-familiarity would be very seemly, do you?\nDOCTOR: As you wish, ‘Mrs Clarke’. (BEAT) Where is Mr Clarke, by the way?\nCONSTANCE: That information is classified. And I am not deserting. Let me make that quite clear. (BEAT) You can travel in time?\nDOCTOR WHO: CRISS-CROSS (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: I can.\nCONSTANCE: Then we shall return just as soon as this business has been cleared up. Less than a year, you said.\nDOCTOR: ‘This business’ being... the Second World War?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, that’s right. (BEAT) Is there going to be a Third?\nDOCTOR: I shouldn’t really say...\nCONSTANCE: But there will be a world to return to? At the proper time, I mean.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Don’t worry on that account. The human race has a few millennia in it yet. (BRIGHTLY) Mrs Clarke, I am at your disposal to return you to your duties at whatever time you see fit. Until then, I shall be very glad of your assistance.\nCONSTANCE: I’m pleased to hear it. From what I’ve seen so far, goodness knows, you need it.\nCONSTANCE: THE END"
