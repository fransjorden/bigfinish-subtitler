(FX:\nFILOFAX: THUMPS ON TABLE) So, Mel, what have you got for me?\nMEL: As you know, the building is the Zenos Tower, headquarters of the Zenos Corporation. Named after the mysterious Alek Zenos.\nDOCTOR: Why mysterious?\nMEL: Because he never leaves his office on the top floor, and he only deals with the great and the good. He’s not even named in the accounts.\nDOCTOR: Interesting.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 8\nMEL: He seems to have risen without trace over the last few years, becoming head of his own media empire.\nDOCTOR: Anything else?\nMEL: (FX: HANDS OVER PAPER BAG) These are the company accounts, all copied onto floppy disc. They’ve been buying up newspapers, publishers, radio stations. All through an intricate network of dummy companies to avoid the attention of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\nDOCTOR: Most useful. I’ve made some inquiries myself, on the stock market. There is some concern about the Zenos Corporation.\nMEL: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because, aS you Said, Zenos have come from nowhere. For all anyone knows they’re just another stock market bubble getting ready to burst.\nMEL: Except we know they do have backing. From the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Have you seen them, Mel?\nMEL: In the tower? No.\nDOCTOR: No. This isn’t like the Daleks at all. And that makes me nervous.\nMEL: Which makes me nervous.\nDOCTOR: So, Mel, anything else about this time that’s different?\nMEL: Well, there’s Warfleet, that’s new.\nDOCTOR: Warfleet?\nFLASHBACK TO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 9\nMEL: Brinsley, what are you doing?\nBRINSLEY: Nothing, Miss Bush, just... programming.\nMEL: Playing a computer game at work? I could have you fired.\nBRINSLEY: Are you going to?\nMEL: No. Count yourself lucky that it’s my first day. What is this game, anyway?\nBRINSLEY: Warfleet. It’s a new console, only came out a few weeks ago. It’s well wicked.\nMEL: What’s so ‘wicked’ about it?\nBRINSLEY: You get to fly a spaceship, go on missions.\nMEL: (UNIMPRESSED) Oh.\nBRINSLEY: But that’s not all. You link up with other players over the phone using modems, so you all play at once.\nMEL: In different spaceships?\nBRINSLEY: Right, but flying together. You’d love it.\nMEL: I doubt it’s my sort of thing.\nBRINSLEY: It’s nearly time for lunch anyway. Go on. Live a little.\nMEL: Oh, alright then.

But you should really talk to my colleague Brinsley Heaton, he’s the expert.\nDOCTOR: (FX: JOTS NOTE IN FILOFAX) ‘Brinsley Heaton’ .. You don’t like to play computer games, Mel?\nMEL: I don’t like to be the sort of person who plays computer games.\nDOCTOR: So, this game is an anachronism. Is there any connection to the Zenos Corporation?\nMEL: They own the factory that makes the consoles. “UltraMega Tech”.\nDOCTOR: Which surely can’t be a coincidence. Well done, Mel. I — Are you wearing something different?\nMEL: I was wondering how long it would take you to notice.\nDOCTOR: I don’t like to be the sort of person who cares about what people are wearing.\nMEL: It’s for tonight. Alek Zenos is holding a VIP reception in the penthouse suite.\nDOCTOR: And you managed to procure an invitation?\nMEL: No, but dressed like this, is anyone going to turn me away?\nDOCTOR: I admire your initiative, Mel. But if Alek Zenos is working for who we think he’s working for —\nMEL: I know. I’1l1 be careful.\nDOCTOR: Don’t take any chances. I’1l meet you here, same time tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nMEL: Anything I should be looking for in particular?\nDOCTOR: Anything out of the ordinary. I tried scanning the Tower but it just came up as a normal office block. They must be using some sort of cloaking pattern.\nMEL: Either that or it is just a normal office block.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS) Well, I suppose we shouldn’t rule out any possibility — no matter how far-fetched.\nMEL: What about you?\nDOCTOR: I have these discs to keep me busy.

We go over live to our reporter at the scene, Serena Paget.\nSERENA: You join me outside the factory gates, now closed to its former employees, dismissed without notice. The union is demanding the workforce be reinstated, but the Ultramega Tech management are refusing to negotiate. The result is a stand-off between pickets and police, who, as you can see, are prepared for another night of unrest. I have with me Frank Lewis, who has been leading the protest.\nFRANK: All we're asking for is our jobs back. We’ve been laid off without pay, without reason. All we want is a deal.\nSERENA: But what about the attacks on the police?\nFRANK: This was a peaceful demonstration, before the police started dragging people off and arresting them —\nSERENA: So you don’t condemn the attacks?\nFRANK: I condemn any acts of violence, on all sides.\nSERENA: Thank you. This is Serena Paget, at the Ultramega Tech Factory in Bradford.\nCONTINUES INTO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nCONTINUES INTO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nHORSES: SNORTING.\nPICKETS: (SINGING) We shall, we shall not be moved... [ETC, DIES AWAY]\nPOLICE OFFICER: (VIA LOUDHAILER) Move along there. I said, move along...!\nSERENA: We’re clear? Good. I don’t suppose anyone could find me a coffee?\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY BESIDE HER) I can’t offer you a coffee, Ms Paget —\nSERENA: (STARTING) What? Where did you— [spring from? ]\nDOCTOR: . but I can offer you an exclusive.\nSERENA: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: You know this factory was taken over by the Zenos Corporation earlier this year?\nSERENA: I’ve heard rumours, but —\nDOCTOR: And doesn’t it intrigue you, that just after all the workers were laid off, this factory was used to manufacture a new game console?\nSERENA: Why should that intrigue me?\nDOCTOR: Because you’re a journalist. The question you should be asking is this: Why are they so keen to keep it secret?\nSERENA: Alright then. Why?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I was hoping you might help me find out.\nFRANK: If she won’t help you, I will.\nFRANK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind of you —\nFRANK: Frank. Until a few weeks ago, I was the shop steward.\nSERENA: And now you lead the picket line.\nFRANK: You can’t just lay people off overnight. These men have wives and kids to support.\nDOCTOR: Never mind the politics, you said you could help me.\nFRANK: You’re not the only one who wants to know what’s going on in there. They say they’ve automated the production line but nobody’s seen anything being taken in. No machines, nothing.\nDOCTOR: No?\nFRANK: The only things that get in are empty lorries — which come out again with full loads.\nDOCTOR: What about raw materials?\nFRANK: Nothing.\nSERENA: (INCREDULOUS) But they must be getting the parts from somewhere\nDOCTOR: Quite the mystery, isn’t it? Well? Is your curiosity piqued, Serena Paget?\nSERENA: We'd have to get inside, take a proper look.\nFRANK: Not a problem. I still have the keys to the back gate.\nDOCTOR: You’ve never thought to look before?\nFRANK: Never had a reporter with me before. And whoever you are.\nFRANK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: Me? Oh, I’m just an interested party. Call me the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nCELIA: For goodness’ sake, man, don’t you know who I am? Celia Dunthorpe. M.P. for Pottersbridge.\nNILES: (COMING OVER) Ignore the idiot security man, Celia. You can cut in with me.\nCELIA: Niles! Thought this might be your sort of thing.\nNILES: I should cocoa! A chance to press the flesh of Alek Zenos, the enigmatic multi-millionaire. I heard he started out selling suntan lotion.\nCELIA: I heard he started out selling stuffed vine leaves from the back O£ a cart.\nNILES: Either way, seems very much our kind of person. Maybe even a potential party donor.\nMEL: Even though you know nothing about him.\nNILES: I’m sorry, I don’t believe we’ve been introduced...\nMEL: Melanie Bush.\nCELIA: OF s.?\nMEL: Time and Related Disciplines Incorporated.\nNILES: Ah, I see, how... delightful.

(OFF, TO SECURITY) I’m Celia Dunthorpe. As well you know.\nMEL: The thing is, Niles —\nNILES: Leave it to me. (TO SECURITY) Niles Bunbury. This is Melanie Bush, she’s my ‘plus one’.\nCELIA: Quick, Niles, before the elevator goes.\nNILES: Honestly, the bureaucracy.\nMEL: (QUIETLY) Honestly, my name should’ve been on the list —\nNILES: Don’t worry about that. Can’t have a pretty thing like you left out in the cold, can we?\nMEL: No.\nNILES: It’s alright. I’m an old hand, I’1l take you under my wing.

Welcome!\nDALEKS: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nSERENA: It’s deserted.\nDOCTOR: Let’s not jump to any conclusions.\nFRANK: Watch out, you’1ll have the whole lot down on us. The assembly workshop’s through here.\nDOCTOR: Be careful. Be very careful.\nSERENA: What are you talking about? What are you expecting?\nDOCTOR: The worst. Okay, Frank. Open the door. Slowly.\nFRANK: Right —\nELECTRICITY: GENERATORS.\nFRANK: But.. there’s just a conveyor belt. No workers, no automation, nothing.\nDOCTOR: A conveyor belt carrying copies of the Warfleet game console. But where are they coming from?\nFRANK: What are you on about?\nDOCTOR: Look.\nSERENA: What is that? Some kind of laser light show?\nFRANK: A fuzzy blue archway... leading to nowhere.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: That’s where the games are coming from. A time corridor.\nSERENA: A what?\nDOCTOR: They’re being manufactured on another world, possibly in another time.\nSERENA: You think they’re being made by aliens?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly.\nFRANK: Well, that would explain why they’re not part of the union.\nDOCTOR: (SUDDEN) Get down, both of you!\nSERENA: (WHISPER) What are those things?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Daleks!\nDALEK TWO: Distribution vehicles have arrived.\nDALEK ONE: We must supervise collection.

Like Metal Mickey!\nNILES: Or Dusty Bin!\nMEL: Those attachments on the front, I think one weapon.\nCELIA: What on Earth makes you think that?\nDALEK TWO: Would you like a prawn cocktail?\nMEL: No, really, I had a big lunch.\nDALEK TWO: Your appearance does not register.\nMEL: What?\nDALEK TWO: Who are you?

Melanie Bush.\nDALEK TWO: (AS THOUGH NOTING NAME) Melanie Bush.\nALEK: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Alek Zenos.\nALEK: Thankyou, too kind. Welcome to the Zenos Tower, home of the Zenos Corporation. I’m here as a representative, of a.. foreign power. Allow me to introduce... the Daleks!\nCELIA: They’re called Daleks! Oh, how sweet!\nALEK: When I say foreign power, that is something of an understatement. You may find this hard to believe, but the Daleks come from another planet.\nALEK: You’re right to be sceptical. But please hear me out. They are the force behind the Zenos Corporation. And I — on their behalf — have gathered you here to make you a business proposition.\nNILES: Go on. We’re all ears.\nALEK: The world is changing. In the next century, Earth will no longer exist in glorious isolation. It will be competing amongst hundreds, thousands of other worlds in the intergalactic market.\nCELIA: I do believe the fellow is as mad as a March hare.\nMEL: I’m very much afraid he isn’t.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nALEK: If the Earth is going to compete, it will need to attract investment. And that’s what the Daleks are offering. Financial investment.\nNILES: In the planet Earth?\nALEK: No. Not the Earth. The United Kingdom. The offer is for your country to have favoured-nation status. The Daleks will deal with the UK, and the UK will act on behalf of the Earth.\nCELIA: (NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY) As a sort of middle-man?\nALEK: Only one country can act as humanity’s shop-window, and you are, after all, a nation of shopkeepers.\nNILES: Just to play along for a moment, what is the nature of this investment?\nALEK: A good question. They offer their expertise, their technical know-how. The UK will become a hotbed of scientific research. But that’s not all. The Daleks offer a cheap, secure supply of energy.\nCELIA: No more having to deal with trade unions and oil sheikhs!\nALEK: Quite. In short, they offer the UK an economic miracle. A golden age, yours for the taking.\nMEL: And what do they want in return?\nALEK: A cultural exchange. Through the Zenos Corporation, they want to invest in the UK’s media outlets. After all, the UK is the country of Shakespeare, Gainsborough and Elgar. Our history and culture are amongst our greatest assets. — This, ladies and gentlemen, is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A partnership with another species!\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nDALEKS: Daleks invest and return! Daleks invest and return!\nDALEKS: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nDALEKS: SERENA AND DOCTOR WATCH FROM A DISTANCE.\nDALEK: (OFF) Workers will continue loading!\nFRANK: They’re just loading up the boxes, no questions asked.\nSERENA: You’d think they’d ask a few questions, working for those... things.\nFRANK: With three million on the dole? You can always find scabs willing to cross a picket line.\nDOCTOR: Mr Lewis, we have far more to worry about than industrial relations.\nSERENA: Doctor, what exactly are these “Daleks”?\nDOCTOR: An unimaginably cruel and ruthless race, bred for war. Their only goal is the total extermination of all rival species.\nFRANK: So what are they doing in Bradford?\nDOCTOR: Nothing good, we can be sure of — Frank, get down!\nFRANK: What?\nDALEK: Intruders detected. Exterminate! (FX: FIRES)\nDOCTOR: They’ve spotted us. Run! Ruuun!\nEXPLOSIONS: ALL AROUND!\nEXPLOSIONS: 2 X DALEKS: Seek, locate, exterminate! Seek, locate, exterminate!\nEXPLOSIONS: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nDALEK: Would you like some champagne?\nNILES: Cheers. (FX: DALEK POURS DRINK) I still don’t believe a word of it. Any minute now, the top of one of those things is going to pop up, with Jeremy Beadle inside.\nCELIA: I’m not sure. Whether or not they’re aliens, Mr Zenos was talking a lot of common sense.\nALEK: (JOINING THEM) I’m glad you thought so.. Mrs Dunthorpe.\nCELIA: Niles was just saying, he thinks this is all a prank.\nALEK: Rather an elaborate one. Don’t worry, I’11 soon lay to rest any doubts you may have... And who is this?\nMEL: My name’s Mel. Melanie Bush.\nALEK: I don’t recall that name being on the guest list. My secretary must have added you. Delighted to have the unexpected pleasure of your company, Mel.\nDALEK: Alek Zenos. You are required.\nALEK: Terribly sorry, if you’1l excuse me. (LEAVES)\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nALEK: Well, what is it?\nDALEK: Intruders have been detected in the Bradford importation centre.\nALEK: What? Strikers causing trouble?\nDALEK: They have not yet been identified.\nALEK: If they’ve seen what’s going on, it doesn’t matter who they are. They must be exterminated.\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nPURSUING: BUT NOT FIRING.\nDALEKS: Seek! Locate! Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: In here! We’ll have to try to get out the way we came in.\nSERENA: Those things are trying to kill us!\nDOCTOR: Well done for spotting that, I can tell you’re a journalist.\nFRANK: Maybe we could push the shelves on top of them. There’s enough junk here to —\nDALEK: Intruders located!\nFRANK: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Out of the way, Frank.\nDALEK: Intruders must be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: (TO DALEK) Wait! (BEAT) Don’t you recognise me?\nDALEK: You are an intruder.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m far more than that. I’m the Doctor.\nDALEK: Physiognomy does not match records. Physiology does match records. You are the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I knew you’d get there eventually.\nDALEK: You are an enemy of the Daleks. You must be exterminated.\nDALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR: Don’t you want to interrogate me first? You must have lots of questions you’re dying to ask. Out of all the times I’ve defeated you, which time was my favourite?\nDALEK: You must be exterminated.\nFRANK: Oh no you don’t, you... (PUSHING SHELVES) .. strike-breaker!\nDALEK: Storage units collapsing! Retreat —\nDALEK: JUNK. IT TRIES TO MOVE, BUT IS STUCK.\nDALEK: My movement is impaired. (WHIRR) My weapon is unimpaired.\nFRANK: What? No. No!\nSERENA: He — he’s dead...!\nDOCTOR: Quickly, Serena. While the Dalek’s jammed in! (BOTH EXIT)\nTHAT: HAVE FALLEN ON TOP OF IT.\nDALEK: Doctor and human female are escaping. Unable to pursue. My movement is impaired. Assistance required!\nDALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nDALEK: One intruder has been exterminated. The others have escaped.\nALEK: I told you we should’ve used human guards.\nDALEK: One of the intruders has been identified. It was the Doctor.\nALEK: Well, that changes everything, doesn’t it? Inform the Emperor. Now, if you don’t mind, I have guests to attend to.\nDALEK: Human dissidents are blocking the entrance to the plant, preventing distribution vehicles from leaving.\nALEK: (AMUSED PARTING SHOT) Well, you know what to do about that, don’t you?\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nSERENA: That Dalek — it killed Frank with a death ray.\nDOCTOR: I doubt he’s the first. And he won’t be the last.\nSERENA: Is that all you can say?\nDOCTOR: Do you have a car?\nSERENA: What?\nDOCTOR: I need to get back to London. We know the Zenos Corporation is behind this. A friend of mine is attending a V.I.P. reception at the Zenos Tower.\nSERENA: You’re asking for a lift?\nDOCTOR: And on the way, I’1l tell you everything I know.\nHONKING HORN. STRIKERS JEER: “SCAB!” ETC.\nSERENA: The trucks are trying to get out, they’ll never manage it.\nDOCTOR: Not without a fight.\nLIKE: DOCTOR WHO CLIFFHANGER STING.\nSERENA: (OVER DIN) What the hell is that!?\nDOCTOR: Cover your ears. Cover them!\nSERENA: Alright.\nSERENA: FERVENTLY. HORSES SNORT AND STAMP.\nSERENA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nPICKETS: (AGGRESSIVE SINGING) We shall, we shall not be moved [ETC]\nPOLICE OFFICER: (VIA LOUDHAILER) Clear the way! Move along...! (ANGRIER) Move along!!!\nSERENA: What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Keep back.\nPICKETS: (JEERING) Fascists! Filth!\nPOLICE OFFICER: (VIA LOUDHAILER) Clear the way! Move along! You lowlifes, move along!\nPICKETS: (CHANT) Come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough!\nPOLICE OFFICER: (VIA LOUDHAILER) You hear them, lads?! Clear these animals! These subhumans! Move them along!\nTHROWING: BRICKS.\nSERENA: This is madness! What’s got into them?\nDOCTOR: What’s got into them indeed...\nSERENA: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: That sound you heard must’ve been some kind of mental conditioning, making them act against everything they believe in!\nSERENA: The trucks are getting out!\nSERENA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: And once they’re clear, the effect will wear off, everyone will go back to normal, and it will all blow over. Isn’t this what you came here for? To report on a riot?\nSERENA: No. No, I didn’t want this.\nDOCTOR: Then take me back to London.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nALEK: (RETURNING) Ladies and gentlemen and Honourable Members, please forgive me for keeping you waiting. In the world of business, there is always a last-minute crisis.\nALEK: Anyway, you’re probably all asking yourselves, what this Zenos chap says is all very well, but alien worlds? Intergalactic markets? Isn’t that all a bit.. far-fetched? A bit... science fiction?\nNILES: You said it!\nALEK: So let me give you all the proof you need. (TO DALEKS) Activate time corridor!\nDALEK: Time corridor activated.\nALEK: Follow me through this archway, and I’1l show you a vision of the UK’s future in partnership with the Daleks.\nDALEK: Guests will enter time corridor.\nEACH: VANISHING WITH A WHOOSH AND CRACKLE.\nALEK: Please, one at a time, there’s no need to push!\nCELIA: Typical, wherever you go, there’s always a queue. It’s the 1970s all over again.\nNILES: Yes... I’m not sure about this.\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nMEL: Nor am I.\nDALEK: You have nothing to fear. Enter time corridor! Enter!\nNILES: Alright, no need to get your knickers in a twist! Mel, you can hold my hand if you like.\nMEL: I can manage, thank you.\nNILES: A liberated woman? Very well. Righty-ho, here goes.\nTIME: VORTEX.\nTIME: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 37\nSERENA: But how could it make the police do that?\nDOCTOR: It didn’t make them do anything. It amplified primal emotions and base instincts that are normally buried deep in the psyche. Fear. Anger. Hatred.\nSERENA: But how?\nDOCTOR: My guess is, a focussed beam of hypnotic suggestion.\nSERENA: A “hypno-ray”!?\nDOCTOR: The effect is temporary, but given sufficient exposure it would make you think like them.\nSERENA: Like a Dalek?\nDOCTOR: That’s what a Dalek is. A bubbling lump of hate. Would you mind if I used your car phone?\nSERENA: Go ahead. Good luck getting reception.\nSERENA: Who are you calling?\nDOCTOR: My friend at the Zenos Tower. I’m calling her mobile.\nSERENA: (IMPRESSED) She has a mobile phone?\nDOCTOR: Yes. But she must be out of range.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 38\nCELIA: Look at that sunset! It’s as if the clouds are on fire.\nNILES: This place is like something from a Dan Dare annual! Everything that fellow was saying, about the Daleks... it was all true!\nMEL: This is EFarth’s future?\nALEK: In a sense. This world is an example of the rewards of Dalek investment.\nCELIA: You’re saying Britain could look like this? All glittering skyscrapers, palm trees and swimming pools?\nNILES: (LAUGHS) Not much use in our climate.\nALEK: (LAUGHS) Oh, that’s easily fixed. We have weather control technology.\nMEL: So what’s the name of this planet then, if it’s not Earth?\nDALEK: Skaro. This is the planet Skaro.\nMEL: Skaro!\nALEK: You’ve heard of it?\nMEL: (SHE’S GIVEN HERSELF AWAY) No, I... no, of course not.\nALEK: Skaro is the Daleks’ homeworld.\nCELIA: They live here?!\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 39\nNILES: Seems a bit of a waste if they sit in their tin cans all day. Or can they nip out and sunbathe?\nDALEK: Alek Zenos. You are required.\nALEK: You must forgive me. Please, everyone. Refresh your drinks and enjoy the view. It’s a rare privilege to set eyes on an alien world!\nEXITS INTO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 40\nALEK: Well, what is it?\nDALEK: The Emperor wishes to speak to you.\nALEK: I’m honoured.\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) Alek Zenos. One of the humans you have brought here has been identified. As a companion of the Doctor.\nALEK: Really?\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) The female known as ‘Mel’.\nALEK: Well, of course. You don’t think I’d allow her to come here by accident, do you?\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) Explain.\nALEK: Isn’t it obvious? With her as our captive, the Doctor dare not interfere.\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) You brought her here deliberately?\nALEK: As soon as I heard the Doctor was at large, I double-checked the guestlist. Now we have his companion, he will have no choice but to submit.\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) The Doctor must obey the Daleks. Or she will be exterminated.\nDALEK EMPEROR: END OF PART ONE\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 41"

Sleep well?\nDOCTOR: No, but your couch was very good for sitting and thinking on.\nSERENA: I made you tea, is that alright?\nDOCTOR: Splendid, thank you. (TAKES TEA) Ow, hot!\nSERENA: Sorry. Still no word from your friend?\nDOCTOR: No. And it’s not like Mel to stay out all night.\nSERENA: She sounds fun.\nNEWSREADER: Today’s headlines. The police are still holding several protestors after the riot at the UltraMega Tech factory. The government has condemned the violence. In happier news, reclusive millionaire Alek Zenos this morning announced his engagement to computer technician Melanie Bush.\nDOCTOR: (SPRAYS OUT TEA IN SURPRISE) Mel!\nSERENA: Your friend moves fast.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be obtuse, Serena. This is a message.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 42\nSERENA: What sort of message?\nDOCTOR: A veiled threat, telling me that Mel is their prisoner and that they’1l kill her if I dare to oppose them.\nSERENA: You got all that from that report?\nDOCTOR: It’s how the Daleks operate. Take hostages, force their enemies to surrender. So that’s what I have to do.\nSERENA: What?\nDOCTOR: Surrender.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: FOUNTAINS.\nALEK: Good morning, Mrs Dunthorpe, Mr Bunbury. I hope you’re enjoying your breakfast.\nCELIA: (EATING) Full English, no foreign muck, quite right.\nNILES: (EATING) Charitable of you to put us up for the night.\nALEK: Not at all. Our pleasure. If you agree to our investment, you may, Of course, have your own luxury apartments here.\nNILES: A holiday home on an alien planet! Certainly beats two weeks in the Algarve.\nALEK: Although, of course, your own capital will be similarly transformed.\nMEL: You intend to fill London with loads of weird-shaped skyscrapers?\nCELIA: Not sure I’d approve, monstrous carbuncles and all that.\nALEK: Don’t worry, it would retain all its architectural heritage. No. I was thinking your run-down estates and boroughs could be converted into luxury apartments. After all, your guests will need somewhere to stay.\nNILES: Sorry, what was that last bit? Aliens coming to Earth?\nALEK: To do business. And enjoy your rich culture. London would be the greatest city on Earth, befitting its status as the capital city of Earth.\nCELIA: Now that I do like the sound of.\nNILES: One question, though. What if we turn down this offer?\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nALEK: We would be disappointed, of course, and would have no alternative but to offer the same arrangement to other nations.\nCELIA: You mean, you’d go to the French? Or the Germans! ?\nALEK: You are our first choice. With your membership of the European Union, NATO and the commonwealth, the United Kingdom is ideally placed to be the leading nation of Earth.\nCELIA: (TO HERSELF) The beating heart of a new British empire!\nNILES: Steady, Celia. Let’s not sign on any dotted lines just yet.\nALEK: Quite right. Now, I’m sure you’re keen to see more of Skaro. So, if everyone’s ready, shall we begin the tour?\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 45\nSERENA: But why build a tower in the shape of a Dalek?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it obvious? They wanted to get my attention.\nSERENA: So what’s to stop them shooting you the moment you walk through the front door?\nDOCTOR: My reputation. The Daleks will assume I’m up to something terribly devious — they won’t dare kill me until they know what at 2S 6\nSERENA: So you are up to something terribly devious?\nDOCTOR: No. But they don’t know that. (CLIMBS OUT OF CAR)\nSERENA: Well, good luck.\nDOCTOR: There’s a man you need to find, a colleague of Mel’s called Brinsley Heaton. He’s probably spending his Saturday at home. Here’s his address.\nSERENA: Why do I need to see him?\nDOCTOR: Ask him about Warfleet. He’s an expert. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: WORLD. LIGHT SKARO WIND. GUESTS MUTTERING AND CHATTING.\nDALEK ONE: Guests will halt and observe view.\nALEK: In the distance you can see the Dramakin Mountains, just across from Lake Davien.\nCELIA: It’s like... glistening sapphires.\nNILES: And what are those, in the sky? Personal flying saucers?\nALEK: Dalek drone-ships. Pilotless craft, used for transportation and deliveries.\nMEL: Was Skaro always like this?\nALEK: A very good question. The Daleks have perfected terraforming technology and can adapt any environment and construct structures with astonishing rapidity.\nNILES: (REALIZES) The Zenos Tower! That turned up practically the day after they got planning permission!\nCELIA: No unions, that’s the key. No strikes to hold things up.\nALEK: Given that we offer full employment and prosperity, even a trade unionist would be hard-pressed to find something to moan about.\nNILES: So are all the worlds that take up your offer like this?\nALEK: Not quite. Other Dalek worlds specialise in manufacturing or service industries. But all are thriving, enjoying unprecedented economic growth.\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nMEL: I don’t know. In my experience, offers that sound too good to be true tend to be exactly that.\nALEK: I’m sorry, I don’t follow?\nMEL: You’re promising the people of Earth — sorry, the people of Britain — wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, if they agree to let the Daleks ‘invest’.\nALEK: Yes, that’s it, in a nutshell.\nMEL: So what’s the catch?\nNILES: The girl makes a good point. What’s in the small-print?\nALEK: I can assure you, you have nothing to fear, the Daleks abide by all — (trade)\nCELIA: I say, should that saucer-ship be doing that?\nALEK: No, I’m not sure — (it should)\nDALEK ONE: Under attack! Under attack! Exterminate! (CONTINUES UNDER\nFOLLOWING: )\nALEK: Everybody, get under cover! For your own safety. Let the Dalek deal with this.\nCELIA: What the hell is going on?\nALEK: Just a small... security matter.\nNILES: A small security matter?! That thing’s shooting at us!\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nMEL: No. It was only trying to kill the Dalek, not us.\nALEK: Calling all Dalek patrols. Attack on observation walkway nine. Send reinforcements.\nDALEK: (VIA RADIO) We obey.\nALEK: Everybody, please, stay back, I promise you — (that)\nCELIA: Oh my word, it’s shot him. (FX: SLAPS HIS FACE) Alek! Wake up! Wake up!\nNILES: Mel, maybe we should do as the chap said —\nMEL: No, wait! Look! It’s landed.\nAFRID: Statue-still! All of you! Or we’1ll shoot again.\nMEL: We’re not moving, we’re not moving!\nSHARI: You two, the Earthgirl and the Earthman.\nNILES: Do you mean us?\nSHARI: You’re coming with us.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nAFRID: Unless you want to get killed?\nMEL: It’s not high on my list of priorities, no.\nNILES: What do you want us for?\nSHARI: Explanations later. We have to get out of here.\nMEL: Can’t you leave the way you came?\nAFRID: Not now the alarm’s been raised, they’d shoot us down as soon as we were airborne.\nNILES: Then what, if you don’t mind me asking, are you doing?\nSHARI: Here, hold these.\nMEL: What are they? Relay batons?\nSHARI: Just don’t let go whatever you do. Ready. And energise.\nVOICES: BECOME INCREASINGLY DISTORTED.\nMEL: (OW!) What’s happening?\nSHARI: Don’t worry. It’s just a portable time-warp generator.\nNILES: A what?\nDALEKS: Intruders in city. Exterminate. Exterminate. (CONTINUES IN B/G AS THEY APPROACH )\nSHARI: Prepare for temporal jump. Brace yourselves.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nMEL: What? Where are you taking us —\nNILES: Oh my word, oh my word —\nNILES: THE DALEKS ARRIVE.\nCELIA: I’m afraid you’re too late. They’ve gone.\nDALEK TWO: Temporal residue detected. They have escaped through a timewarp.\nCELIA: And they attacked your ambassador-friend, Alek.\nDALEK THREE: His injuries are not fatal. He will recover.\nCELIA: But who were those people? And why did they attack us?\nDALEK TWO: They are enemies of the Daleks. They are Thals!\nDALEK TWO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: What, no reception? (ALOUD) I expected to be expected!\nDALEK: You are the Doctor. Do not move! Do not move!\nDOCTOR: Why? Are you worried I might have something up my sleeve?\nDALEK: You are the enemy of the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you could say that. Considering the number of times I’ve defeated you. It’s almost as if I can’t help myself.\nDALEK: Move into the elevator. Move!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I can move again now, can I? — “Room for eight persons or less.” Well, I suppose you count as persons. Or less.\nDALEK: You are to be taken to Skaro.\nDOCTOR: This lift goes all the way to Skaro?\nDALEK: There is a time corridor on the top level.\nDOCTOR: All for me? How kind. Shall I press the button?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR: COUGHING AND GROANING SLAVES HAULING TRUCKS AND UNLOADING ROCKS. CHILLY WIND. MEL AND CO APPEAR.\nNILES: Oh my goodness, oh my — my breakfast! What happened?\nAFRID: You’ve been transported across space-time.\nMEL: By tumble-drier, or so it feels. So where are we now?\nSHARTI: Callico Nine. One of the Dalek slave worlds.\nAFRID: Shari. A patrol will be here any moment, they’1l have followed our time-trace.\nSHARI: You're right, Afrid, we should move. This way.\nNILES: Sorry, did you say ‘slave world’?\nAFRID: This is the Daleks’ economic miracle. Take a good look.\nSHARI: Once this planet was like your Earth. Rich in natural resources, home to a civilised race. Well, fairly civilised.\nNILES: And now it’s all factories and ruins and... chain gangs?\nMEL: What happened here?\nAFRID: The Daleks made contact with one of the nations of this planet, offered to let them rule it.\nNILES: (REALIZING) Great Britain.\nSHARI: That’s how they get a foothold. Then, gradually, over a period of months, they alter people’s minds.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nAFRID: Make them think like Daleks.\nMEL: How do they do this, exactly?\nSHARI: Indoctrination? Brainwashing? The end result is a planet ruled by a nation that follows Dalek ideology, that acts like Daleks... That might as well be Daleks.\nAFRID: Happy to help the Daleks to asset-strip their world for all it’s worth. All its minerals, its fossil fuels. The favoured elite rules, while the rest of the inhabitants become a slave labour force.\nNILES: And this is what the Daleks intend for Earth.\nMEL: I told you it sounded too good to be true.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nMEL: B/G.\nDALEK ONE: Attention. All guests are to return to Earth. Follow to temporal transduction chamber. Follow! Follow!\nCELIA: Alek? Alek, are you alright?\nALEK: (WAKING) I’m fine, yes. Fine. What happened?\nCELIA: Those... Thals, they... disappeared. With Niles and Mel.\nALEK: (GETS UP) Right. Daleks, do you know where they went?\nDALEK TWO: Destination. Callico Nine.\nALEK: You've informed the security services?\nDALEK TWO: They were alerted while you were unconscious.\nALEK: Efficient as ever.\nCELIA: It was my idea. But what would the Thals want with them?\nALEK: Who knows? There are always those resistant to progress, who seek to turn back the tide of progress.\nCELIA: Oh, we have them too, we call them socialists. That’s what these Thals are?\nALEK: They’re an irritation, but in any free society such as ours, some dissent is inevitable.\nDALEK THREE: Report. The Doctor has been located.\nDALEK THREE: IN\nDALEK THREE: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nALEK: He has? Where?\nDALEK THREE: He has entered the Zenos Tower and surrendered.\nCELIA: Sorry, who is this Doctor?\nALEK: Another who seeks to prevent the Daleks expanding their trading bloc. (TO DALEK) Is he still in the Tower?\nDALEK THREE: He is being brought here. He is to have an audience with the Emperor.\nALEK: I’1ll go and fetch him, shall I?\nDALEK TWO: He must be guarded by Daleks.\nALEK: Of course, but I’d like to meet him.\nDALEK TWO: You may escort him.\nALEK: Thankyou. Now, Celia, I’m afraid it’s time you returned to Earth with the other guests —\nCELIA: Not on your Nelly. I want to meet this Emperor of yours.\nALEK: What?\nCELIA: I haven’t come all this way to speak with the monkey when I could be talking to the organ-grinder!\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nMEL: So, Niles, what do you think of the Daleks’ offer now?\nNILES: Excuse me, I haven’t signed up for anything. I thought this intergalactic market sounded fishy, we’re better off going it alone if you ask me.\nMEL: Shari, where exactly are you taking us?\nSHARI: You’1ll see soon enough.\nMEL: We haven’t been introduced, by the way. My name’s Mel.\nSHARI: We know who you are.\nMEL: You do?\nSHARI: You’re a companion of the Doctor.\nMEL: Oh. You know about the Doctor.\nSHARI: Of him. He’s helped our kind in the past.\nNILES: ‘Our kind’? What kind are you?\nAFRID: Thals.\nNILES: You’re from this planet?\nAFRID: No. We’re from Skaro. Our forefathers were. Now the only Thals on Skaro are slaves.\nNILES: I didn’t see any slaves when I was there.\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nAFRID: Of course not. The people who clean the streets are kept out of Sight in a labour camp in sector twelve.\nMEL: So why did you bring us here?\nSHARI: To show you this. And help the Doctor.\nMEL: I don’t follow.\nSHARI: While you were the Daleks’ hostage he would be unable to defy them. But now you can both help us in our struggle.\nMEL: You want to get Skaro back?\nAFRID: That world is no longer our home. We just want to free the slaves.\nNILES: Ah, I’m not sure I want to get mixed up in local politics —\nSHARI: You already are. But you’re welcome to stay here, if you wish.\nNILES: Oh my word, is that a spaceship?\nAFRID: What do you think? I thought Earthmen were intelligent.\nNILES: But it just appeared out of thin air —\nSHARI: It was cloaked. Well. Are you coming on board or not?\nDALEK: Fugitives located!\nNILES: Those things, they can fly!\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nDALEK: Exterminate!\nNILES: I’m coming with you.\nAFRID: Then get inside, Earthman.\nSHIP: TAKES OFF.\nDALEK: Enemy spacecraft ascending. Despatch drone-ships. Pursue and exterminate! Pursue and exterminate!\nDALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nDALEK: Time corridor activated. Doctor arriving.\nDOCTOR: Hello there. Are you the welcoming committee?\nDALEK: I am your guard. Move!\nDOCTOR: I say, you’ve had the place redecorated. I don’t like it.\nALEK: (APPROACHING, WITH CELIA) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Alek Zenos. Tell me. Was the company named after you, or were you named after the company?\nALEK: Does it really matter?\nDOCTOR: Not particularly. I have an inquisitive nature. Which leads me to ask — who is this lady here?\nCELIA: Mrs Celia Dunthorpe. MP for Pottersbridge.\nDOCTOR: You’re a long way from Pottersbridge, Mrs Dunthorpe.\nCELIA: Alek has been kind enough to show me the Daleks’ home planet.\nDOCTOR: Very kind.\nCELIA: And I must say I’m impressed. If this is what Dalek investment can achieve, it’s just what the UK needs.\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS) Dalek investment? So that’s what the Zenos Corporation is for. A Trojan horse!\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nALEK: We act as trade ambassadors for the Daleks..\nDOCTOR: Stooges, lapdogs, quislings. The Daleks can always find somebody willing to do their dirty work for them.\nDALEK: Doctor. You are to be taken to the Emperor. For interrogation.\nDOCTOR: Oh good, I have some questions for him too. Lead on, McDalek!\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nBRINSLEY: (VIA INTERCOM) Hello, yes?\nSERENA: Brinsley Heaton? My name’s Serena Paget. I’m a journalist.\nBRINSLEY: (VIA INTERCOM) Haven’t I seen you on the telly?\nSERENA: I’ve come to speak to you. About Warfleet.\nBRINSLEY: (VIA INTERCOM) Hold on.\nBRINSLEY: Come in, I’m through here. Mind the bike... Did you say Warfleet?\nSERENA: I’m told you’re an expert.\nBRINSLEY: What do you want to know?\nSERENA: Everything.\nBRINSLEY: Right. May take a while. Would you like a cup of tea?\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nBRINSLEY: ABOUT. DOCTOR LED IN.\nDALEK: You will enter the Imperial Chamber.\nDOCTOR: Delighted. (CALLS OUT) Hello there!\nDALEK EMPEROR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: This is a great honour. For you. Allow me to introduce Mrs Celia Dunthorpe.\nCELIA: Your... majesty.\nDOCTOR: She’s a Member of Parliament, but I wouldn’t hold that against her. Now. Where’s Mel?\nDALEK EMPEROR: Your companion’s life is dependent upon your co-operation.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought it might be. But I’m not going to tell you anything until I’m sure she’s unharmed. Well?\nDALEK EMPEROR: The human Mel is alive.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Much as I would like that to be true, you’1l forgive me if I don’t take you at your word.\nALEK: Show the Emperor some respect, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’m showing it as much respect as it deserves. (TO EMPEROR) Tell me, what’s this I hear about you investing in Earth?\nDALEK EMPEROR: It is our new paradigm. To extend our influence through economic power. The power of the free market!\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t sound very Dalek to me. Whatever happened to conquering worlds? Subjugating the inferior species?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nDALEK EMPEROR: War is inefficient. Daleks do not need to resort to it.\nDOCTOR: (TO CELIA) I hope you’re getting all this, Celia.\nCELIA: Oh yes, it’s all most fascinating.\nDALEK EMPEROR: The Daleks offer a future of prosperity. Of unlimited financial growth!\nDOCTOR: You appeal to their basest instinct. Greed! And that’s what you’re offering Earth.\nCELIA: Not the Earth, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What?\nCELIA: They are very generously offering to make Great Britain Great again, as the Daleks’ favoured nation.\nDOCTOR: As the Daleks’ puppets!\nDALEK EMPEROR: We offer humanity the chance to realise its full potential. The Earth will become one of our core work-worlds, a centre for industry and commerce.\nCELIA: It may be a hard truth to face, Doctor, but if we’re to compete in the intergalactic market, we have to attract foreign investment. Better the Daleks invest in us than take their money somewhere else!\nDOCTOR: Good grief. Who needs Daleks when you have politicians?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: BLEEPING. BUTTONS PRESSED.\nSHARI: Leaving ionosphere and entering deep space.\nNILES: Now I’m an astronaut! This is turning out to be quite the morning.\nAFRID: Detecting five Dalek drone-ships on intercept course.\nMEL: I didn’t think they’d give up the chase.\nSHARI: But this time we’re one step ahead. (FX: INTERCOM ON) Contacting Fleet Leader. Shari speaking.\nFLEET LEADER: (VIA INTERCOM) Eagle Leader. Receiving you.\nSHARI: We have rescued the Doctor’s companion and are heading to meteoroid cluster. Have lured five drones after us.\nFLEET LEADER: (VIA INTERCOM) Then you know what to do.\nSHARI: Shari out.\nNILES: What was that all about?\nAFRID: There’s a resistance fleet hidden in the Callico meteoroid cluster.\nMEL: Who exactly is in this resistance fleet?\nSHARI: Thals like ourselves, and a dozen other races that have reason to despise the Daleks.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nMEL: And — let me get this straight — you’re planning on ambushing them in the meteoroid cluster?\nSHARI: It’s a strategy that’s worked before. Why do you ask?\nMEL: Because this whole set-up is suddenly feeling very familiar...\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nBRINSLEY: The consoles only came out a few months ago, but already there are thousands of kids playing at once.\nSERENA: Through the phone lines?\nBRINSLEY: Yes. It’s toll-free, paid for by the Zenos Corporation.\nSERENA: The graphics looks better than most games.\nBRINSLEY: It’s state of the art. I even opened the console up once. Inside, it was like nothing on Earth.\nSERENA: Maybe it is.\nBRINSLEY: What?\nSERENA: It doesn’t matter. So, the game you’re playing, what’s going on?\nBRINSLEY: A rebel ship has escaped from one of our empire-worlds, and we’ve been ordered to pursue it into the meteoroid belt.\nSERENA: Where you’1ll destroy it?\nBRINSLEY: Well, yeah. That is the whole point of the game.\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: What about Warfleet?\nCELIA: Warfleet?\nDOCTOR: A game console distributed on Earth by the Zenos Corporation but manufactured by the Daleks.\nALEK: Actually, manufactured on another of our work-worlds, where the labour costs are cheaper.\nDOCTOR: Let me guess. The games aren’t games at all. They’re a direct interface to the Dalek battle fleet.\nDALEK EMPEROR: You are correct, Doctor. The humans that play the game are guiding Dalek drone-ships against our enemies.\nDALEK EMPEROR: See now, a squadron of drone-ships in pursuit of a rebel spacecraft in the Callico star system.\nCELIA: And when you catch up with them?\nDALEK EMPEROR: They will be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: But why? Why can’t you pilot your own spaceships?\nDALEK EMPEROR: Our battle computers are logical. They lack instinct and intuition. Their decisions can be predicted.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS AT THE MEMORY) Oh yes, I remember.\nDALEK EMPEROR: We have found that human children are more effective than any battle computer.\nDOCTOR: (HORRIFIED) What?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nALEK: They are the most effective strategists. They have a genius for war. A genius we are happy to exploit.\nDOCTOR: You’re taking innocent children and using them as your killers!\nDALEK EMPEROR: They enjoy it. They find it amusing. Addictive. They are as good as Daleks!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 69\nSHARI: Eagle Leader. Dalek drone-ships closing in. Heading into meteoroid cluster... Now.\nFLEET LEADER: (VIA INTERCOM) Fleet preparing to attack.\nMEL: What’s to stop the Daleks sending more drone-ships?\nAFRID: If they do, we’ll be ready for them.\nMEL: No. You won’t stand a chance. I know what they’re doing.\nNILES: You do?\nMEL: Those drone-ships aren’t being flown by Daleks. They’re being controlled by children, back on Earth. They think it’s alla great big computer game!\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 70\nBRINSLEY: Commander Brinsley to all Hawk-ships. Prepare to fire.\nSERENA: You're talking to the other players now?\nBRINSLEY: Yeah.\nBRINSLEY: Warning. All Hawk-ships. It’s an ambush. Rebel fleet detected!\nBRINSLEY: Two Hawk-ships down. Three. Four. Last man standing. Reinforcements required.\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 71\nDALEK EMPEROR: Reinforcements despatched. One thousand drone-ships warp- jumping to battle co-ordinates.\nDOCTOR: What you’re doing is obscene. If those children knew the games resulted in real deaths, — (do)\nALEK: Would they still play them? Why wouldn’t they? War is a fundamental part of human nature. The finest moments in human history have been its great battles.\nDOCTOR: Every ‘great battle’ has its casualties, leaving wives without husbands, children without fathers, mothers without sons.\nDALEK EMPEROR: But there is no risk of human casualties. They pilot our drone- ships, free to kill without being killed.\nALEK: It’s the ultimate computer game, Doctor. Reality itself.\nDALEK EMPEROR: For countless millennia the human race has fought amongst itself. To no purpose. But now they fight for us!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nDALEK EMPEROR: ON SCENE’ VIA SCREEN.\nBRINSLEY: Just in time... reinforcements warping into gamma quadrant.\nSERENA: There’s hundreds of them.\nBRINSLEY: Almost the whole hawk-fleet. (LAUGHS) Oh, this is going to be a massacre!\nSERENA: Wow. You really love this game.\nBRINSLEY: Who wouldn’t? (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Oh no you don’t!\nSERENA: What is it?\nBRINSLEY: The rebel ship we followed into the cluster, it’s trying to slip away. No chance. Locking onto plasma trail!\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 73\nSHARI: It’s no good, they’ve spotted us!\nNILES: Can’t you do something? Open another time-warp?\nMEL: We can’t. Warp-jump isn’t possible in a meteoroid cluster. We'd need to be in clear space.\nSHARI: You know a lot about space warfare.\nMEL: I have some experience.\nAFRID: Shields down to seventy percent.\nSHARI: We'll have to fly deeper into the cluster, it’s our only chance.\nSHARI: BLASTS FROM PURSUING DRONE SHIP.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nALEK: Now you see how the Daleks deal with insurrection!\nCELIA: Quite right too. The rule of law must be maintained.\nDALEK: Dalek drone-ships engaging rebel fleet. Enemy fleet suffering greater losses.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Do not spare a single ship. They must be exterminated! Exterminated!\nCELIA: Teach them who’s boss. It’s the only language they understand!\nDOCTOR: Oh, Celia. You really are quite mad.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 75\nBRINSLEY: Come on, you know the game’s up. There’s no getting away. Nearly got them.. Exterminate! (LAUGHING) Exterminate! Exterminate!\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 76\nAFRID: Shields at twenty percent. We can take one more hit, two at most, and that’s it.\nNILES: Isn’t there anything you can do?\nSHARI: Unfortunately that drone-ship doesn’t want to give up.\nMEL: Can you open a communication channel to the drone-ship?\nAFRID: What?\nMEL: Can we contact them? Well?\nSHARI: I suppose we could try. Why? What’s your plan?\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 77\nDALEK EMPEROR: The rebel fleet is outgunned and outnumbered. They can only flee!\nDALEK: Communication detected from rebel ship.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Show me.\nMEL: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Hello. This is Mel, calling everyone in the Hawk-Ships.\nDOCTOR: Mel!\nMEL: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Listen. The game you’re playing isn’t a game. It’s real. Real people are dying. You have to stop!\nDALEK EMPEROR: Is the communication reaching the drone-ships?\nDALEK: No. We have blocked the signal.\nCELIA: (LAUGHS) Oh, well done!\nDOCTOR: You told me Mel was safe.\nDALEK EMPEROR: No. I told you she was alive.\nALEK: She escaped, Doctor, the rebels rescued her.\nDOCTOR: Now you mention it!\nDALEK EMPEROR: Her escape was futile. The rebel ship has no means of escape, no hope of survival. It will be destroyed!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 78\nBRINSLEY: Just one more shot, that’s all it will take. One more shot. Come on... and fire!\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nAFRID: Shields destroyed. We’re defenceless!\nMEL: Please. Listen to me. You have to stop firing. You’re being used, by the Daleks!\nSHARI: I don’t think they can hear you.\nNILES: What?\nSHARI: The communication is being blocked. They have no way of knowing that they’re participating in a massacre!\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 80\nMEL: Please. Whoever you are. You have to stop playing the game. Please. I beg you!\nDALEK EMPEROR: She knows her communication is being blocked but keeps trying.\nDOCTOR: That’s Mel for you. She never gives up, never surrenders.\nDALEK EMPEROR: And now she will die. Watch, Doctor. Watch, as your companion is exterminated — at the hands of her own kind!\nDALEK EMPEROR: END OF PART TWO\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 81"

You have to stop — [playing]!\nAFRID: It’s no good, Mel, there’s nothing we can do.\nMEL: If only they knew we were real, and not just part of a computer game. That’s it! We have to do something that an enemy ina computer game would never do!\nNILES: Such as?\nMEL: Shari, bring us to a halt.\nSHARTI: What? But that’s suicide.\nMEL: No. We’re surrendering!\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 82\nSERENA: What’s happening, Brinsley? Why have you stopped firing?\nBRINSLEY: Because they have.\nSERENA: What?\nBRINSLEY: The spaceship I was chasing, it’s just hanging there in space.\nSERENA: (LAUGHS) Maybe they’ve run out of fuel?\nBRINSLEY: No. Something’s wrong. This has never happened before. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Activating zoom-in scan. (REACTS) I don’t believe it...\nSERENA: Oh my — Someone’s holding a piece of paper up at the spaceship window!

I mean, the fighting was over?\nSERENA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nSHARI: I don’t believe it. All the Dalek drone-ships — they’ve stopped moving.\nMEL: Yes, because they know we’ve surrendered.\nSHARI: No, it’s not just that. They’ve been switched off.\nNILES: Switched off?\nMEL: The ships are operated by remote control, Niles. If that radio link is disconnected —\nNILES: Like those little boats you get in ponds.

But if you kill me you won’t be able to save your drone-fleet.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Explain.\nALEK: If you’ll allow me to go to the network station, I can bring the drone-ships back to Skaro, under our control.\nDALEK EMPEROR: You can do this?\nALEK: I think so, yes. But I’1ll need the Doctor’s help, if I’m to save them in time.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nALEK: I’ve been led to believe you’re a programming genius.\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, I am.\nDALEK ONE: The Doctor cannot leave.\nALEK: Well, then your fleet will be destroyed.

Doctor, if you could help?\nDOCTOR: Of course. Any particular frequency?\nALEK: Oh, a thousand megahertz should do it. Now!\nALEK: WARBLING.\nDALEK: (LOSING POWER) Interference in sensor relay. Motor function impaired. You have betray... (OUT COLD)\nALEK: Off!\nCELIA: What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Just sent the Dalek to sleep.\nCELIA: What?\nDOCTOR: I assume that’s why Alek brought us here. This room is shielded. So we can talk without fear of being overheard. So tell me, Alek. Who are you working for?\nALEK: Why do you ask?\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: Because you’ve either been extremely clever or extremely stupid.. and I’d quite like to know which.\nALEK: Extremely clever.\nDOCTOR: So, you’re working for the resistance, trying to bring down the Daleks from within.\nALEK: The Daleks enslaved my world, killed my family. The only way I could survive was by co-operating... By pretending to co-operate.\nDOCTOR: Which world?\nALEK: Kantra. Do you know it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s a tropical paradise, a site of outstanding natural beauty, home to a million unique species.\nALEK: Not anymore. Now it’s a radioactive slag heap.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you.\nCELIA: So, Mr Zenos, you’re a spy? A fifth-columnist?\nALEK: That’s why I suggested the Daleks use humans to guide their drone-ships. Because it would just take a change of command, and —\nDOCTOR: And you could use them against the Daleks. You can bring them back under human control?\nALEK: Not from here. But the link can be re-instated from Earth. There’s a code that will over-ride the Dalek cut-out, then the drone ships will be controlled by the Warfleet game again.\nDOCTOR: And then what? You launch an all-out assault?\nALEK: No. There are slave workers being kept in a labour camp in sector twelve. It would be a rescue mission.\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: Sounds like you’ve got it all worked out. What about Mel?\nALEK: As soon as I realised she was your companion, I arranged for her to be ‘kidnapped’.\nCELIA: So the Daleks couldn’t use her as a hostage! You cunning devil!\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nALEK: A Dalek fleet has arrived in the Callico system. The rebel fleet will have no choice but to flee. The Dalek fleet will pursue them into deep space —\nDOCTOR: Leaving Skaro vulnerable to attack from the drone ships.\nALEK: The anti-Dalek league have been working on this plan for years. But it’1ll all be for nothing if you don’t get back to Earth. Well, Doctor? Celia? Will you help me?\nDOCTOR: I’m in. Celia?\nCELIA: Me too.\nALEK: But you seemed quite enamoured of the Daleks —\nCELIA: I was playing along. Do you think I’d be so stupid as to be taken in? They’re a menace to society, anyone can see that!\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nDALEK: (VIA RADIO) Dalek assault fleet moving to attack position.\nPAST: US. WE CUT TO THE REBEL SHIP:\nAFRID: They’re warping in to finish the job themselves.\nMEL: There’s hundreds of them. We don’t stand a chance.\nSHARI: That’s not part of the plan. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Calling all ships. Relocate to deep-space rendezvous.\nMEL: Plan? What plan?\nAFRID: The resistance fleet will draw the Dalek fleet away.\nSHARI: Leaving Skaro an open target.\nAFRID: We're clear of the cluster, Shari. Free to warp-jump.\nNILES: (SLAPS KNEES) So let’s get going, shall we?\nSHARI: No. You’re going back to Earth.\nMEL: We are?\nAFRID: Generating time-warp.\nSHARI: We’re relying on you, Mel. The moment the drone-fleet comes under human control...\nMEL: I’1l do my best.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nSHARI: And Niles.\nNILES: Yes?\nSHARI: Warn your people. Warn them about what the future will hold if you let the Daleks invest.\nNILES: Oh, you don’t have to worry about that, I shall make the point in no uncertain terms.\nAFRID: Energising...\nSHARTI: Good luck.\nMEL: And you too. Good luck, Shari, Afrid —\nSHARI: Okay. Let’s get the hell out of here.\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nDALEK ONE: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Rebel fleet warping out of sector.

Do you know how to activate it?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure I can work it out.\nCELIA: You’re not coming with us, Alek?\nALEK: I’1ll follow, once you’re through.\nDOCTOR: If you’re sure.\nALEK: (WHISPER) Shh — a Dalek patrol!\nCELIA: (CALLS) Over here! Alek Zenos has betrayed you. He’s helping the Doctor escape!\nALEK: What?\nDOCTOR: Celia!\nDALEKS: Halt. Do not move. Halt or you will be exterminated. (REPEAT\nUNDER: FOLLOWING)\nALEK: (OVER PREVIOUS LINE) Go, Doctor. Go. Now!\nDOCTOR: But Alek —\nALEK: Just go, go!\nALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nDALEK ONE: Time corridor activated.\nDALEK EMPEROR: The Doctor has returned to Earth. Dalek task force to pursue.\nDALEK EMPEROR: The Doctor must be recaptured.\nDALEKS: We obey!\nDALEK EMPEROR: And bring Alek Zenos to me!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nDALEK: Alek Zenos. You are to be taken to the Emperor.\nALEK: Why not just exterminate me now?\nDALEK: Move!\nALEK: Celia. I thought you were on our side.\nCELIA: I’m afraid you underestimated me. As if I would ever join with ‘rebels’. My allegiance is with the Daleks.\nALEK: Betraying your own species.\nCELIA: On the contrary. I firmly believe we’re far better off with the Daleks than against them.\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nCELIA: IN.\nMEL: We’re back!\nNILES: In Hyde Park, by the look of it.\nMEL: It’s London, close enough.\nNILES: I suppose I could get a cab back to Whitehall.\nMEL: Good luck. (FX: MEL’S PHONE GOES) Sorry, that’s me. Five Missed calls. Don’t recognise the number. Check messages.\nNILES: (CALLS OUT) Taxi! Taxi!\nNILES: Whitehall, driver. Department of Energy. And step on it.\nMEL: Niles, wait! The Doctor’s in the Zenos Tower! (FX: SHE DIALS) Brinsley. I need your help.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nBRINSLEY: What is it? The Doctor?\nSERENA: The Doctor? The Doctor’s on the phone?\nBRINSLEY: No, it’s his friend — Mel. She says he’s in terrible danger, that we should get to the Zenos Tower.\nSERENA: But he gave himself up —\nBRINSLEY: (INTO PHONE) Right, on our way. (FX: HE HANGS UP) She says she'll meet us there.\nSERENA: (PULLING ON COAT) Well, we’d better get a move on then.\nSERENA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nDALEK EMPEROR: Alek Zenos. You are a traitor.\nALEK: My loyalty lies with your victims.\nCELIA: Typical liberal bleeding heart!\nDALEK EMPEROR: Explain. Why has the Doctor returned to Earth?\nALEK: As if I’d tell you.\nCELIA: He’s gone to take control of your ‘drone’ fleet. They intend use it against you.\nALEK: You realise you’ve just condemned thousands to death?\nCELIA: Oh, what utter tommy-rot. All I want is peace. You can’t negotiate with ‘rebels’.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Alek Zenos. You are condemned to immediate execution.\nALEK: Kill me, and who will act as your ambassador on Earth?\nDALEK EMPEROR: You will be replaced. By Celia Dunthorpe. Exterminate.\nDALEKS: Exterminate!\nCELIA: You want me to take over, from him?\nCELIA: to\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nDALEK EMPEROR: You have demonstrated your loyalty. You will be chief executive of the Zenos Corporation.\nCELIA: I’m flattered, but I’m not —\nDALEK EMPEROR: You must return to Earth and locate the Doctor. Prevent his attack.\nCELIA: I will do my best to repay your faith in me. Thank you.\nDALEK EMPEROR: The humans Niles Bunbury and Melanie Bush have also returned to your world. They must be recaptured.\nCELIA: Oh, I’m sure that won’t be too hard. (LEAVING) If you’1ll excuse me, I’ll get started straight away.\nDALEK EMPEROR: The drone fleet must be destroyed.\nDALEK: Dalek fleet currently engaged in warp-pursuit. Only core unit available to disperse drone fleet.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Then recall Dalek fleet at once!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nSERENA: You work here at the Zenos tower?\nBRINSLEY: Yep, I have a pass-card, it should be good to get us in.\nSERENA: (CLIMBING OUT OF CAR) Maybe we should wait out here.\nBRINSLEY: What the — this Doctor fella, what does he look like?\nSERENA: Short-ish, about forty, has a — it’s him! It’s him!\nFIRING: AFTER HIM.\nDALEKS: (PURSUING) Halt! Halt! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING TOWARDS CAR) Get back in the car!\nSERENA: Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: (AT CAR, BREATHLESS) No time to explain, get in the car!\nBRINSLEY: What are those things?\nDOCTOR: Daleks!\nBRINSLEY: Daleks?\nDOCTOR: Daleks. And they’re trying to kill us. Drive, Serena! Drive!\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nNILES: Secretary of State? Your receptionist said to go right in. have some urgent — (SEES) Oh no. What are you doing here?\nCELIA: What do you think, Niles? Waiting for you.\nNILES: Celia.\nDALEK: You will come with us.\nNILES: What? What?\nCELIA: Don’t worry, we're not going far. Just a short hop across town\nCELIA: by time corridor.\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nSERENA: (DRIVING) Where are we going, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere we can access Warfleet.\nBRINSLEY: Back to my place then.\nDOCTOR: Brinsley, isn’t it? Nice to meet you. I’m the Doctor.\nBRINSLEY: Don’t worry, I’ve been told everything by Mel.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’ll save time.\nBRINSLEY: (SEES SOMETHING) Mel!\nDOCTOR: Yes, you —\nBRINSLEY: No, outside. Over there! Pull over.\nSERENA: Give us a chance.\nBRINSLEY: She said she’d meet us at the Tower. Good job we didn’t miss her.\nDOCTOR: Mel! Get in!\nMEL: (RUNS UP, BREATHLESS) Doctor! I was just looking for you — I thought you might be in trouble.\nDOCTOR: I was. Fortunately our friends arrived in the nick of time. Your idea, I assume?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 107\nMEL: Save the congratulations. We have a Dalek drone-fleet to activate!\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nDALEK: Enter. Enter!\nCELIA: Niles, please, make yourself comfortable in my office.\nNILES: Your office?\nCELIA: I now serve as a parliamentary consultant to the Zenos Corporation.\nNILES: What sort of consultant?\nCELIA: The position of ambassador became vacant, so I stepped in. empowered to act on behalf of the Daleks.\nNILES: You think they’re going to let you rule the world?\nCELIA: Why not? I admit there is a certain amount of personal\nCELIA: am\nCELIA: ambition... but ambition is not a dirty word. I’m not a traitor.\nCELIA: I’m just more willing to take a long-term view.\nNILES: What long-term view?\nCELIA: Just think about it for a moment. The Daleks are real, we can’t\nCELIA: wish them away. And they’ve made us an offer.\nNILES: To become another of their slave-worlds.\nCELIA: No. They are offering us sorely-needed investment in our schools, our hospitals, our armed services. We are being\nCELIA: offered the chance to make the UK the financial services centre\nCELIA: of the whole planet. The whole galaxy!\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 109\nNILES: You think this is a way to rebuild the empire? Turn the map back to pink?\nCELIA: For goodness’ sake, Niles, try to think rationally. What happens if we turn them down? They’re going to make the same offer to another country. The Germans, or the Japanese or heaven forbid, the French!\nNILES: And we wouldn’t want them getting our golden age.\nCELIA: At least if Britain becomes the Daleks’ favoured nation, we can act as a buffer, use our influence to preserve our way of life. Imagine if they went to Saudi Arabia, or the Soviet Union, or China. They’d love them over there! The Daleks are not ideal partners, I admit.\nNILES: They exterminate their enemies.\nCELIA: Yes, there are some cultural differences, but we must respect their customs. I’d rather have them as allies than enemies.\nNILES: We could remain outside the Dalek trade bloc, independent.\nCELIA: And then how long would we survive? No. The intergalactic market is a fact of life. You do believe in a free market, don’t you, Niles?\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 110\nBRINSLEY: It’s through here, in the front room.\nDOCTOR: And it’s still connected to the Zenos network?\nBRINSLEY: Think so, yes.\nSERENA: So what’s the plan?\nDOCTOR: We need to re-establish control of the drone fleet. Mel?\nMEL: Already onto it. Just a question of gaining access to the server and entering the over-ride codes.\nSERENA: You can do this?\nDOCTOR: Serena, Mel is the best computer hacker there is!\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 111\nCELIA: The question is, Niles, what am I to do about you?\nNILES: Me?\nCELIA: The Emperor is keen to have you exterminated and I’m reluctant to disappoint him.\nNILES: Celia, please. Please! I — beg you. For old times’ sake.\nCELIA: Very well. For old times’ sake. But just you be a good boy.\nNILES: Yes. I’1l be a.. good boy.\nDALEK: Report. Humans attempting to access Warfleet game server.\nCELIA: The Doctor, one assumes. Inform the Emperor.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 112\nMEL: And the last code?\nDOCTOR: F nine, A six, one C.\nMEL: Over-ride accepted!\nBRINSLEY: My Hawk-ship, I’m back in control!\nSERENA: What’s that red planet?\nDOCTOR: Skaro. And that’s our target. Brinsley, contact your fellow players.\nBRINSLEY: Onto it. Commander Brinsley calling all Hawk-Ships.\nDOCTOR: You have a new mission. The planet below is the heart of the Daleks’ evil empire, where slave workers are being held captive. You must rescue them and destroy the planet!\nBRINSLEY: Listen. You have a new mission. The planet below is the heart —\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 113\nBRINSLEY: (VIA HOLOGRAM) - of the Daleks’ evil empire. Slave workers are being held captive. You must rescue them, then destroy the planet!\nDALEK EMPEROR: Close the communication!\nDALEK: Unable to do so. Drone fleet now under human control.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Cut the link!\nDALEK: Unable to do so. Dalek core unit now under attack from drone- fleet.\nDALEK EMPEROR: But if they are destroyed we will be defenceless!\nDALEK: Core unit outnumbered by drone fleet ten to one.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Where is the main Dalek fleet?\nDALEK: Recall signal sent. They are returning. (BEAT) Warp-trace detected. Enemy ships arriving in Skaro orbit.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Enemy ships?\nDALEK: Thal Eagle-ships. The rebel fleet is here!\nDALEK: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 114\nBRINSLEY: (VIA RADIO)\nBRINSLEY: Repeat. This is Commander Brinsley, calling all Hawk-Ships. You have a new mission. [The planet below is the heart of the Daleks’ evil empire, where slave workers are being held captive. You must rescue them and destroy the planet! ]\nAFRID: Shari! The Doctor and Mel must have succeeded.\nSHARI: Then it’s now or never. Hold tight, Afrid. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Entering descent orbit, target — capital city!\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 115\nBRINSLEY: All Hawk-ships, descend towards capital city. Engage enemy ships. Do not be diverted.\nMEL: Remember this is a rescue mission. Take out defence installations only.\nDOCTOR: Tell them to approach through the mountains for cover.\nBRINSLEY: Maintain attack formation. Approach the city through mountains.\nSERENA: (OVER PREVIOUS LINE) Looks rather fun, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Except it’s not fun. It’s life and death.\nMEL: Approaching Dalek city. Laser turret sighted.\nBRINSLEY: I see it. Wait for it — now!\nBRINSLEY: We have an incoming call, unidentified sender.\nMEL: Put it on.\nSHARI: (VIA MONITOR) Mel! Thought it was you.\nMEL: Shari and Afrid. I got back.\nAFRID: (VIA MONITOR) We can see. We need to get to the labour camp in sector twelve, near the south walls.\nMEL: I see it. (FX: CROSS TO: )\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nSHARI: We need you to take out the laser turret covering this sector.\nMEL: (VIA MONITOR) Commander Brinsley?\nBRINSLEY: (VIA MONITOR) Target sighted.\nBRINSLEY: (VIA MONITOR) Target destroyed.\nAFRID: Well done, Commander Brinsley.\nMEL: (VIA MONITOR) You’re now clear to land outside the camp.\nSHARI: Commencing descent. We’1ll still need covering fire.\nMEL: (VIA MONITOR) Understood. We’ll hover overhead, take out any Daleks we see.\nBRINSLEY: (VIA MONITOR) Speaking of which — here they come!\nBRINSLEY: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 117\nDALEK ONE: South laser turret destroyed.\nDALEK: TWO Dalek patrol despatched to sector twelve.\nDALEK EMPEROR: They are after the Thal slaves. They could attack us but instead they waste time freeing workers.\nDALEK THREE: Dalek Fleet now emerging from warp in Skaro solar-space.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Then send them down to take out the enemy ships. Destroy them. Destroy them all!\nDALEK TWO: Capital city under attack.\nDALEK ONE: Central laser turret destroyed.\nDALEK EMPEROR: They are getting too close, too fast. We must advance our plans. Open a communication to Celia Dunthorpe.\nDALEK TWO: I obey.\nDALEK TWO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 118\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) Dalek Emperor to Celia Dunthorpe.\nCELIA: Receiving you, your highness. May I say, this — (is a)\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) Our plans must be brought forward. You understand the true purpose of the Zenos Tower?\nCELIA: I do, yes.\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) The alembic field must be amplified.\nNILES: The what?\nCELIA: Shush, Niles! Amplified to what level?\nDALEK EMPEROR: (VIA MONITOR) Maximum amplitude and maximum range. It must reach the Doctor’s location.\nCELIA: I understand.\nCELIA: Well, you heard your Emperor. What are you waiting for?\nDALEK: Commencing amplification of alembic field.\nDALEK: RISING IN B/G DURING REST OF SCENE.\nNILES: What’s an alembic field?\nCELIA: Why do you think the Daleks built this tower in the heart of London?\nNILES: I don’t know —\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 119\nCELIA: It’s a broadcasting tower. But rather than broadcasting radio and television, it influences hearts and minds.\nNILES: Influences them how?\nCELIA: It unlocks pre-existing potential. Don’t worry, you’re quite safe in here, we won’t be affected.\nNILES: But everyone outside?\nCELIA: They will become more intolerant to those who do not share our values. Who flout our way of life, who are not prepared to do an honest day’s work.\nNILES: Oh my lord. You’re turning them into fascists!\nCELIA: No. I’m merely giving them the strength of mind and clarity of purpose of Daleks!\nNILES: Celia, you can’t do this —\nCELIA: The process began months ago. We are simply increasing the pace of change. Now.

Resistance is —\nDOCTOR: Useless, yes, I know. You’ve all been brainwashed.\nSERENA: On the contrary. We finally see the truth.\nDOCTOR: No. Like those policemen we saw. Your minds have been twisted to make you think like Daleks.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nMEL: Silence. (FX: DIALS PHONE) Zenos Corporation. We have the Doctor.

Move it if you want to live!\nSHARI: (RUNNING OVER) Shari, the released slaves, have we got them all yet?\nAFRID: The last group of workers are boarding now. A few more minutes and we'll be ready to launch.\nSHARI: Not before time. The Daleks — [have]\nAFRID: What the hell —\nSHARI: Afrid. The drone-ships. They’re not shooting at the Daleks. They’re shooting at us!\nSHARI: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nDALEK ONE: Drone-ships no longer attacking Dalek emplacements. Drone-ships now attacking rebel forces.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Their controllers have had a change of mind. They are our creatures now!\nDALEK TWO: Celia Dunthorpe reports the Doctor has been recaptured and is being brought back to Skaro.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Summon all members of the supreme council to the imperial chamber. To witness the Doctor’s execution!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 128\nMEL: We're here. You will get out of the vehicle.\nDOCTOR: Or what will you do, Mel? You’re not armed.\nMEL: The Daleks control every human in a ten-mile radius. If you do not obey, then, one by one, they —\nDOCTOR: No need to elaborate. (FX: GETS OUT OF CAR; 2 x DOOR SLAMS) You know, I wonder why the Daleks didn’t use this device earlier.\nMEL: You will enter the Zenos Tower.\nDOCTOR: I assume it was built to create the brainwashing effect? But on a more subtle level. To gradually influence people over a period of years, decades.\nMEL: Keep walking, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: But they’ve had to bring their plans forward. And that’s not good.\nMEL: Proceed to the elevator.\nDOCTOR: Either the brainwashing effect has to be neutralised, or ina few hours everyone in central London will be driven insane.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 129\nBRINSLEY: Rebel fleet dispersed.

Do you know Niles, here?\nDOCTOR: Another Dalek collaborator, I presume?\nNILES: Quite the opposite, actually.\nCELIA: I’ve allowed him to remain alive as a show of clemency.\nNILES: Mel, I’m sorry, I let you down.\nMEL: You were attempting to act against the Daleks. You are fortunate not to have been exterminated.\nNILES: Mel, what’s come over you?\nDOCTOR: She’s been indoctrinated. In-Dalek-ated, you might say. But not you. Interesting.\nNILES: Inside the tower, we’re immune. Alembic field, she called it.\nDALEK: Silence. Do not give the Doctor information.\nDOCTOR: So. You still consider me a threat. But what intrigues me is why Celia has allied herself with you.\nCELIA: Sheer pragmatism, Doctor. Some of us have to be prepared to make the tough choices.\nDOCTOR: They’re only tough choices if you’re choosing the wrong thing.\nCELIA: I am not a fool. I realise the Daleks are... “ethically challenged”. But they are offering us prosperity.\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR: What they are offering you is cheap fuel extorted from other worlds. Cheap goods, manufactured by slaves.\nCELIA: And that is what people want! They aren’t like you. All people care about is being able to put food on the table, being able to make ends meet. They don’t care who makes their microwave ovens or video recorders, they just want them at the cheapest price!\nDOCTOR: Some of them care.\nCELIA: People don’t care. They don’t care if their petrol is provided by an oppressive regime, or if their oranges are grown by a country with apartheid. They just want to be allowed to get on with their lives.\nDOCTOR: I can’t allow this. You know that.\nCELIA: Excuse me? I am an elected representative of the people. I have a mandate. Whoever voted for you?\nDOCTOR: I’m not interested in politics.\nCELIA: Then you have no right to complain. If I went to the people of Britain and I asked them if they wanted to accept the Daleks’ offer, the overwhelming answer would be yes.\nNILES: Selling us out to foreigners —\nCELIA: Quiet, Niles! I offer people prosperity. Jobs. Homes. Whereas you, Doctor. What do you offer?\nDOCTOR: Something far more valuable. A clear conscience.\nCELIA: Yes. I know your type. You think you know better than everyone else. Better than the stupid, average man on the street who can’t be trusted to decide for themselves, because only the Doctor knows best.\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: What if I do?\nCELIA: That makes you a tyrant. No better than the Daleks. Whereas I represent the will of the people. If you have a problem, it’s not with me, Doctor. It’s with the British public.\nDOCTOR: They’re not morally culpable for what’s done in their name.\nCELIA: So I suppose that makes me another one of your enemies, Doctor? Another foe to be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: I see why the Daleks didn’t bother to brainwash you. You’re already one of their kind.\nCELIA: Daleks. Take the Doctor to the guest room.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nCELIA: Mel. Stay with him. Make sure he doesn’t try anything.\nMEL: (LEAVING) I obey.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 133\nSHARI: It’s no good, Afrid. We’re pinned down.\nAFRID: Why are they shooting at us?\nSHARI: Either the Daleks took back control, or... (FX: SHE SWITCHES ON RADIO) Shari calling Commander Brinsley.\nBRINSLEY: (VIA RADIO) You are the Thal Afrid? You are an enemy of the Daleks. You must be exterminated.\nSHARTI: The Daleks must’ve activated the alembic field.\nAFRID: I’1ll arm the freed slaves, establish a barricade. That might buy us a little more time.\nSHARI: For what?\nAFRID: No idea, Shari. I’m just not in any hurry to die.\nAFRID: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 134\nDALEK: Inside. You will wait in here while the time corridor is prepared.\nMEL: I obey.\nDOCTOR: You obey, Mel? Listen. In here, you’re no longer exposed to the alembic field.\nMEL: I obey.\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to obey. You are not a Dalek.\nMEL: The Daleks are the superior beings.\nDOCTOR: Mel —\nMEL: Inferior races must be subjugated or destroyed. They are not like us.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t you, Mel. Look at me. Look into my eyes.\nMEL: (TEMPTED BUT RESISTS) No.\nDOCTOR: Mel, I —\nDOCTOR: Niles?\nNILES: Well don’t just sit there, this is a prison break!\nMEL: I must raise the alarm, I — (MUFFLED, HAND OVER MOUTH)\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: Sorry about this, Mel. But you’1ll thank me later.\nDOCTOR: ‘DOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL’. MEL SLUMPS.\nNILES: What did you do?\nDOCTOR: A small touch of Venusian Ju-Jitsu on the back of the neck. She’1l be out for the count for few minutes.\nNILES: Then we should a move on while we have the chance.\nDOCTOR: No. We have to cure Mel, and deactivate the alembic field. It must be controlled from somewhere on this floor.\nNILES: I think I know where. (LEAVING) This way, don’t dawdle!\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nDALEK: The Doctor and Mel are escaping.\nCELIA: What? But you’ve only just locked them up!\nDALEK: They were released by the human Niles.\nCELIA: Honestly, if you want something doing... where are\nDALEK: Location unknown.\nCELIA: Then I suggest you find them!\nCELIA: Page 136\nCELIA: they now?\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 137\nNILES: (CARRYING MEL) This is it, the right place?\nDOCTOR: It is. The Alembic field is controlled from here.\nNILES: Then hadn’t we better switch it off?\nDOCTOR: First things first. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) If I can create an inversion field within this room, it should restore Mel to her normal self.\nNILES: It won’t affect us?\nDOCTOR: No. It’ll only affect anyone in the centre of those four glowing tubes. Where you should put Mel.\nNILES: (PUTTING MEL DOWN) Right, yes. Then what?\nDOCTOR: Stand back. (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) Generating inversion field.\nNILES: How do we know if it’s worked?\nDOCTOR: We won’t, until Mel wakes up. — Tell me, Niles. Why are you helping us?\nNILES: These Daleks are no friends of mine. I’ve seen what they would do to Earth given half a chance.\nDOCTOR: You’re not persuaded by Celia’s rhetoric, about the intergalactic market?\nNILES: Joining the common market was bad enough. But at least we’re only being bossed around by bureaucrats in Brussels. Being bossed around by Daleks, doesn’t bear thinking about.\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 138\nDALEK: The Doctor, Niles and Mel located in Tower Control Room.\nCELIA: What are they doing in there?\nDALEK: The Doctor is attempting to decondition his companion.\nCELIA: Then for goodness’ sake, get in there and stop him!\nCELIA: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 139\nNILES: Doctor, I think I can hear the Daleks outside —\nDALEK: Deactivate the field generator!\nDOCTOR: But it’s not finished —\nDALEK: Deactivate. Or Niles Bunbury will be exterminated.\nNILES: I think you’d better do as they say, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Very well.\nMEL: (WAKING) What happened — where am I —\nDOCTOR: Mel. Do you know who I am?\nMEL: You are the Doctor. You are the enemy of the Daleks. You must be exterminated.\nNILES: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Well, I think we have our answer.\nCELIA: (ENTERING) Seems you were not quite fast enough, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It seems not.\nCELIA: The time corridor is ready to take you to Skaro. And I’m loathe to keep the Emperor waiting.\nDOCTOR: What about my friends?\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 140\nCELIA: They will remain here. Mel, escort Niles to the guest room.\nMEL: I obey.\nCELIA: Take this gun. Be ready to shoot him if the Doctor tries anything.\nMEL: I obey.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: Not much of a welcoming committee.\nDALEK: Doctor. You will come with us.\nDALEK: BATTLE.\nDOCTOR: Having a bit of trouble?\nDALEK: An attempted attack. It has been repelled.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t sound like it. Sounds like they’re your money...\nDOCTOR: Page 141\nSOUNDS OF DISTANT: giving you a run for\nSOUNDS OF DISTANT: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nAFRID: The Daleks, they’ve broken through the barricade.\nDALEKS: (DISTANT) Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nSHARI: Tell everyone to fall back, get under cover while can, we must fight to the last Thal —\nAFRID: Oh well. We gave it our best shot.\nAFRID: Page 142\nAFRID: they still\nAFRID: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 143\nMEL: This way, Niles Bunbury. In here.\nMEL: (BACK TO HER NORMAL SELF, QUIET) Okay, I think they swallowed it!\nNILES: (LAUGHS WITH RELIEF) Swallowed it? You fooled them, hook, line, and sink-plunger!\nMEL: Luckily I was restored, just in time. But as long as the Daleks don’t know that, we can put the Doctor’s plan into action!\nNILES: So, back to the control room?\nMEL: Yes. But if any Daleks stop us, remember, prisoner and escort.\nNILES: Just you be careful where you’re pointing that thing...\nNILES: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: I say, what’s all this? There must be half of the Dalek supreme council here, what’s the occasion?\nDALEK EMPEROR: You are to stand trial, Doctor. For your crimes against the Daleks. Followed by your public execution.\nDOCTOR: So the verdict’s a bit of a foregone conclusion, then. What are you going to do? Read out a list of my victories?\nDALEK EMPEROR: They were not victories. The Daleks are never ultimately defeated.\nDOCTOR: What intrigues me is, why bother with a trial? You could just exterminate me. So why don’t you?\nDALEK EMPEROR: Your abasement must be demonstrated to all.\nDOCTOR: Of course. It’s not enough just to kill me, is it? You have to prove to all your enemies out there that I am really dead. That you have finally defeated me, once and for all. Because if they don’t see it they won’t believe it.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Soon they will have all the proof they need.\nDOCTOR: You think my death will mean your enemies will give up all hope? But they won’t, you know. They’1l just fight you, stronger than before.\nDALEK EMPEROR: But they will not have the Doctor to assist them.\nDOCTOR: (TO GATHERED CROWD) Before we begin, let me tell you something, all of you. I am unarmed. Alone. Defenceless and completely at your mercy. And if you know me at all, you’1ll know that’s when I’m at my most dangerous.\nDALEK EMPEROR: You dare to threaten us?\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: I don’t need to. You’re already scared. And with good reason. So let me make you an offer. Let me go. And I will let you live.\nDALEK EMPEROR: We have the power of life and death over you. You do not have it over us! We could exterminate you any moment.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take that as a ‘no’. Very well, you’ve made your choice. Don’t say that I didn’t warn you.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 146\nMEL: Made it!\nNILES: Only just. So, now we shut down the alembic thing?\nMEL: Not quite. Those are the controls over there, so —\nNILES: You’ve blown them up!\nMEL: Exactly. Now the alembic field can’t be switched off.\nNILES: What? But all those people out there —\nMEL: (GIVES HIM GUN) Here, hold this. And watch the corridor. The Daleks have almost certainly noticed we’re here.\nCROSS TO: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 147\nNILES: (VIA MONITOR) What are you planning? Mel?\nMEL: (VIA MONITOR) This unit controls the Dalek time corridor...\nCELIA: (OVER PREVIOUS LINE) Daleks! The girl Mel. She is in the control room.\nDALEK: She is an ally of the Daleks.\nCELIA: No, she isn’t, you tin-plated buffoon. She’s already wrecked one of your machines. Get her out of there!\nDALEKS: (LEAVING) We obey.\nDALEKS: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 148\nNILES: The Daleks’ time corridor?\nMEL: The Doctor gave detailed instructions. Let me concentrate. This Switch here...\nNILES: But what are you trying to do?\nMEL: At the moment, it sends anyone who steps through it to Skaro, right?\nNILES: Yes, I know, we went through it.\nMEL: Well, what I’m trying to do is to use it to send this whole building to Skaro!\nNILES: What?!\nMEL: The Zenos Tower should materialize in the middle of the Dalek capital city. If I’ve got it right. Wish me luck.\nNILES: Why, what happens if you get it wrong?\nMEL: Either we’ll be vapourised, flung into the vortex to drift for all eternity, or, worst of all, nothing.\nNILES: In that case, let me be the first to wish you the very best of luck.\nMEL: Thanks.

It’s like I had a headache, and it just lifted.\nSERENA: Me too. I felt so frightened, like I hated everyone, and anything.\nBRINSLEY: Something must’ve come over us.

And I have something to say.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 160\nSHARI: All the free slaves are back on board?\nAFRID: Every one. There is not a single Thal left on Skaro.\nSHARI: To think it was once our home. But no more. Prepare for lift- off.\nAFRID: We did it, Shari! We did it!\nSHARI: I’d hold off on the celebrations, Afrid. We’re not home and dry just yet.\nSHARTI: Odd. A broadcast. From the Zenos Tower.\nDOCTOR: (this is) — the Doctor, calling the Daleks. To bid you a final\nDOCTOR: farewell.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 161\nDALEK EMPEROR: Farewell? You will be destroyed with the Zenos Tower.\nDOCTOR: (VIA HOLOGRAM)\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid you’re out of time, Emperor. You see, the Doctor is only one of my names. You may also know me as Ka Farag Gatri. The bringer of darkness. The destroyer of worlds. The oncoming storm. Well, you asked for it! Here it comes! ..The storm to end all storms!\nDALEK: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Zenos tower now in missile strike range.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Destroy it! Destroy it at once!\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 162\nDOCTOR: And — here goes!\nHOWLING: WHIRLING CHAOS.\nMEL: What’ve you done?\nDOCTOR: I’ve generated a time storm. It’ll affect anything within a hundred mile radius.\nNILES: The Daleks. But what’1l it do to them?\nDOCTOR: Tempus fugit. Accelerated temporal decay.\nMEL: You mean, time’s passing more quickly outside the Tower?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. A lot more quickly.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 163\nDALEK: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Temporal storm has destroyed Dalek assault ships.\nDALEK EMPEROR: Continue the attack. All units.\nDALEK: (VIA HOLOGRAM) Unable to obey, systems failure, systems failure (DIES)\nDALEK EMPEROR: You will obey. All units.(AFFECTED) What is happening? Systems deteriorating. Circuit malfunction. Power failure! Life support degenerating! (DYING)\nDALEK EMPEROR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 164\nNILES: It worked. Those flying saucers just... rusted away to nothing in mid-air!\nDOCTOR: Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust!\nSHARI: (VIA RADIO) Shari calling Zenos Tower, are you receiving —\nMEL: I hear you. This is Mel, Commander Mel.\nSHARI: (VIA RADIO) Just to let you know, we’re clear of Skaro. The last Thals have left, never to return.\nDOCTOR: Then good luck. In your new home.\nSHARI: (VIA RADIO) Thankyou, Doctor. You live up to your legend.\nDOCTOR: Well, I do my best.\nDOCTOR: Now, time we were gone.\nMEL: And how do we do that?\nDOCTOR: Hopefully I can generate a small time-warp here before —\nNILES: Before what?\nDOCTOR: Before this tower is destroyed by the time-storm. Didn’t I mention that? Just give me a second.\nNILES: I’ve just remembered. Celia! She’s out there somewhere.\nMEL: I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do for her, if she’s even still alive.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 165\nNILES: Yes. You’re probably right.\nDOCTOR: Then, if we’re ready —\nNILES: That’ll take us back to London?\nDOCTOR: Fingers crossed. After you.\nNILES: No, after you.\nMEL: Oh, good grief! After me! (SHE JUMPS INTO TIMEWARP)\nNILES: Here goes — (JUMPS)\nDOCTOR: And with five seconds to spare. (JUMPS)\nDOCTOR: EXPLOSION.\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 166\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/MEL/NILES:\nMEL: We made it!\nNILES: Yes. Back in the wind and rain! Typical London weather.\nDOCTOR: Not quite.\nNILES: No?\nDOCTOR: No. This is a side-effect of the temporal shockwave caused by the dematerialization of the Zenos Tower. I’m afraid it whipped up quite a storm.\nMEL: When you say quite a storm, you mean — (how)\nDOCTOR: Oh, about the size of a small hurricane. People will be quite taken by surprise. It’s the weather forecasters I feel sorry for.\nNILES: Well, if you’1ll excuse me, I’d like to get under cover —\nDOCTOR: Yes, goodbye, Niles Bunbury. I recommend a long period of rest and recuperation... on the back benches.\nMEL: Speaking of which, it might be an idea for us to get out of the rain too?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Fortunately I never go anywhere without an umbrella...\nDOCTOR: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 167\nBRINSLEY: What am I going to do?\nMEL: What do you mean?\nBRINSLEY: I have no job, and even worse, the Warfleet game no longer works. What am I going to do all day?\nDOCTOR: ‘Game over’? Oh, I’m sure you’1ll think of something.\nSERENA: The Zenos Corporation may have collapsed and caused the stock market to crash, but its companies are still viable. Someone has to make sure the people they laid off get their jobs back.\nMEL: Contemplating a career change, Serena?\nSERENA: There’s a lot of opportunities, if you know when to take them.\nBRINSLEY: Not really me, though, is it? But I did have one idea.\nMEL: Go on?\nBRINSLEY: Even without Warfleet, the tech that enabled us to link all the computers is still there.\nMEL: Yes, I suppose so —\nBRINSLEY: So maybe I could find some way for computers to link up everywhere in the world. Like a big network. An international network.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) An “internet”?\nBRINSLEY: Might need some help, though, Mel, if you’re —\nMEL: I’m afraid I’m already gainfully employed. And besides, an ‘international network’? I can’t see it catching on.\nMEL: WE ARE THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 168\nFROM: CEILING.\nCELIA: Emperor? Are you there? Hello? Emperor?\nDALEK EMPEROR: (WEAK, DYING) Celia Dunthorpe.\nCELIA: As you can see, I survived. If a little the worse for wear.\nDALEK EMPEROR: You are close to death.\nCELIA: Not as close as you. You see, I think it’s time someone made you Daleks pull your socks up. This lady is taking charge, and she is not for turning. I’m going to be your new Prime Minister!\nCELIA: THE END"
