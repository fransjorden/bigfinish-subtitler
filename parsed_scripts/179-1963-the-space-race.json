You don’t have a replacement.\nDOCTOR: Not as such, no. I should’ve learned my lesson last time.\nPERI: Last time? This has happened before?\nDOCTOR: Once before, yes.\nPERI: So what did you do that time?\nDOCTOR: As I recall I spent several months travelling across China with Marco Polo.\nPERI: So not a lot of help to us now?\nDOCTOR: No. But given time, and suitable facilities, I should be able to effect a repair.\nPERI: Good luck finding an electrical store because, in case you hadn’t noticed, we’re standing in the middle of a desert!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 8\nDOCTOR: Yes. I take your point.\nPERI: Where are we, anyway? Looks like Nevada, or Colorado.\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Unfortunately the TARDIS’s navigational systems are, er... also dependent upon this circuit.\nPERI: You mean we can’t leave?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not.\nPERI: Right, well, I don’t know about you, but I’m going back inside. To see if there’s anything I can burn to keep warm.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that might be — (SEES SOMETHING) No, wait. Peri!\nPERI: What?\nDOCTOR: Over there. Lights. Now where do I keep my telescope? In my other coat? No. (FX: LOCATES AND OPENS TELESCOPE) Ah-ha!\nPERI: What is it?\nDOCTOR: A car, about a mile away. A jeep! It appears to have crashed.\nPERI: But if the headlights are still on, it must’ve only just happened. There might be injured people inside.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. And we can hardly leave them out here to freeze to\nDOCTOR: death. Come on, Peri! We’re needed!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 9\nPERI: I don’t get it. Why did it crash into a ditch, on an empty, straight road, with nothing else for miles around?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it did. Not with any force, at least. The bonnet hasn’t buckled, nor have the bumpers.\nPERI: The ‘bumpers’? Oh, you mean the fenders.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The ‘fenders’. (PULLS) Door’s jammed...

She’s Russian!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 10\nDOCTOR: Or Soviet, at least. According to their identity papers, these people were Doctor Kristina Pushkin, and Doctor Grigory Kalashnikov.\nPERI: Kalashnikov? Like the rifles?\nDOCTOR: Like the rifles. He was an astrophysicist, born in nineteen- nineteen. She was a physician, born in nineteen forty. What about your woman?\nPERI: I don’t know, she doesn’t seem to have any ID on her. It’s a bit hard to tell in this light.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It is getting dark, isn’t it. It’1ll be night soon. Oh well, needs must...\nPERI: Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Taking their coats. They no longer have any need of them, whereas they may prevent us from developing hypothermia.\nPERI: Are you sure that’s wise? We can always get some more clothes back in the...

Can you defuse Lt?\nDOCTOR: Not in this light, there’s no time. We have to run. Run!\nPERI: (RUNNING) Back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: & PERI\nDOCTOR: (HELPING HER UP) Peri, are you all right?\nPERI: (GETTING UP) Grazed knees but basically fine.

Here, take this coat.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 12\nPERI: But why plant a bomb, if everyone in the car was already dead?\nDOCTOR: I think their intention was to remove any evidence of foul\nDOCTOR: play.\nPERI: Right. To make it look like they were killed in the crash!\nDOCTOR: Precisely. And now there’s nothing left to suggest otherwise. Just three thoroughly cremated corpses.\nPERI: There were nearly five.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And nothing piques my curiosity like a brush with death.\nPERI: Don’t tell me. You want to find out who did this and bring them to justice?\nDOCTOR: Well, don’t you?\nPERI: Sure. We can do it first thing, tomorrow. But in the meantime, how about we get back to the TARDIS and — (light a)\nDOCTOR: No time for that, Peri. Look!

You said we were expected?\nLEONID: That is why Captain Kozlov sent me out here, to find you when you did not arrive on schedule.\nDOCTOR: Of course, yes. I’m very glad you found us, Sergeant...?\nLEONID: Kurakin. Sergeant Leonid Kurakin. You have no other belongings?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m afraid we only have the clothes we’re wearing, everything else was destroyed in the fire.\nLEONID: Then there is no point in us remaining here.\nDOCTOR: (OVER ENGINE) How long, do you think, until we get there?\nLEONID: (OVER ENGINE) To the Cosmodrome? About half an hour. Maybe give you a few glasses of Stoli to warm you up, eh?\nPERI: Sounds great. (WHISPER) Doctor. What the hell are we doing, pretending to be, who was it? Doctor Kalashnikov and Doctor Pushkin?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Staying alive.

We’re in Soviet Russia. If they find out where I’m from, they’1ll have me shot!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Then I recommend you don’t tell them. And this isn’t Soviet Russia.\nPERI: (WHISPER) It isn’t? Then where the hell are we?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Kazakhstan.\nPERI: (FORGETTING TO WHISPER) Kazakhstan!\nLEONID: Hey, what are you muttering about back there?\nDOCTOR: We were just talking about your country, what a beautiful place rh 28%\nLEONID: It’s not my country, I’m Kirov born and bred.

MISSION CONTROL.\nMIKHAIL: If Talanov is dead, you know who will be held responsible, Miss Petrov.\nLARISA: At the moment I’m rather more concerned for the well-being of my cosmonaut than my career. If she has died then I’m sure you will make sure no-one ever learns about it.\nALEXEI: (APPROACHING) Excuse me, General Leonov?\nMIKHAIL: Yes, Captain?\nALEXEI: The two scientists from Moscow have arrived.\nLARISA: What scientists? I asked for — (no)\nMIKHAIL: Not my idea, Miss Petrov. They were sent here on the orders of the presidium to share their “specialist knowledge”. Captain. Have them brought here without delay. We may soon be in need of their assistance.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 17\nLEONID: (CLIMBING BACK IN) Nearly there. I have been ordered to take you straight to mission control.\nDOCTOR: Excellent news, looking forward to it!\nPERI: (WHISPER) Mission control? What is this? The Soviet Cape Canaveral?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) More or less. If I know my history — as I invariably do — this is the Baikonur Cosmodrome. A town built in the middle of the Kazakh steppe.\nPERI: (WHISPER) Modelled on downtown Detroit, by the look of it.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Yes, well, it probably looks less foreboding during daylight.\nPERI: (WHISPER) You think? Doctor, that guy you found, how old was he?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Mid-forties, why?\nPERI: (WHISPER) Born in nineteen-nineteen — which makes it the mid- Sixties. The height of the cold war!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) So?\nPERI: (WHISPER) So right now this is one of the most high-security — not to mention dangerous — places on the planet! Particularly\nPERI: for someone of my personal circumstances.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 18\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Then you should be grateful, Kristina, for a chance to see how the other half live!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 19\nLARISA: Capsule emerging from moon shadow... now.\nLARISA: This is Baikonur control calling Vostok seven.

By the look of it you’re having trouble regaining contact with one of your space capsules, am I right?\nMIKHAIL: You are correct. Allow me to introduce Miss Larisa Petrov, our chief scientist.\nLARISA: General, this is hardly the time, I am the middle of a very delicate operation —\nMIKHAIL: These are the scientists sent by the presidium. Doctor Grigory Kalashnikov. And Doctor Kristina Pushkin.\nLARISA: You’re Doctor Kalashnikov? And Doctor Pushkin?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Why? Is there some problem with that?\nLARISA: (SARCASTIC) No, of course not. What could be more helpful than having two scientists I’ve never heard of interrupting my work?\nDOCTOR: What indeed? Tell me, how long has it been since you last made contact with your cosmonaut?\nLARISA: Fifty minutes. The capsule has passed behind the moon, you see.\nDOCTOR: Has it really? How very impressive.\nMIKHAIL: And just before we lost contact with her, Cosmonaut Talanov reported a fault with the life support system.\nDOCTOR: I see. And now she’s not answering her radio?\nLARISA: That’s right. But we have transceiver feedback, so — (we)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 21\nDOCTOR: - You know you’re getting through. Then I suggest you give your cosmonaut a wake-up call.\nLARISA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Disengage the filter and amplify the signal oscillation to create a burst of feed-back, as loud and high-pitched as possible.\nLARISA: It’s worth a try. Amplify signal oscillation.\nLARISA: OUT. WE HEAR A VOICE VIA THE RADIO, NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) (WAKING) What is it? What — where am I?\nPERI: She’s alive!\nMIKHAIL: It seems this is your lucky day, Miss Petrov.\nLARISA: For all of us. (INTO RADIO) Cosmonaut Talanov. What’s your status? Report?\nLARISA: TIME, NOT SWITCHING IT OFF BETWEEN CONTACTS AS BEFORE (NO BEEP AT END OF LINES VIA RADIO). IT STILL DROPS OUT FREQUENTLY AND\nHAS: TIME DELAY.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Who is this? Who are you?\nLARISA: This is Baikonur Control. Are you all right?\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) (BECOMING MORE AGITATED) I do not understand. I can’t see you. Where are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 22\nLARISA: You reported a fault with the life-support. Please give details.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) I do not understand. Where am I? What am I doing here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 23\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) It’s all right, Marinka. You’re safe. Please try to stay calm.\nMARINKA: Marinka? Who is Marinka? Who are you?\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Larisa Pushkin. You must remember me?\nMARINKA: No. I don’t know who you are. But you have to let me out of here!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 24\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Please let me out of here. Where am I? I don’t want to be here anymore. Why have you done this to me? (REPEATS IN B/G AD LIB)\nPERI: What’s the matter with her?\nLARISA: You don’t know? I thought you were supposed to be the expert?\nPERI: I was consulting my colleague. Doctor Kalashnikov?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of stress-induced dissociative disorder, perhaps?\nPERI: Yes, that’s what I thought. (BLUFFING) Short-term memory loss, probably the result of latent claustrophobia.\nLARISA: Or brain damage. If there was a problem with the life-support, and she suffered cerebral hypoxia...\nMIKHAIL: That seems more likely. Cosmonaut Talanov was extensively tested. She is not claustrophobic.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Help me. Please. Let me out. Let me out!\nDOCTOR: Well she is now. May I? (INTO RADIO) Hello. This is the Doctor.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Who are you?\nDOCTOR: A friend. Who wants to help.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) You will let me out of here?\nDOCTOR: As soon as I can, but I need you to help me first.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 25\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) No. Let me out first! Let me out now!\nMIKHAIL: She’s not even aware that she’s floating in space.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. I need you to tell me who you are. What’s your name?\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) (INCREASING HYSTERIA) I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know!\nDOCTOR: You have to calm down. Breathe slowly, can you do that for me?\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Yes.. I breathe... slowly.\nDOCTOR: That’s good. Good. Now, just relax, keep calm, and everything will be all right. (OFF RADIO) Miss Pushkin, General Leonov. We have to bring her back to Earth right now.\nLARISA: Right now? She’s three hundred and fifty thousand kilometres\nLARISA: out. It will take at least three days for her to return home.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 26\nBACKGROUND: MILITARY/CLASSICAL MUSIC ON RADIO.\nLEONID: Miss Pushkin? Mind if I join you?\nPERI: No, not at all. Sergeant Kurakin, isn’t it?\nLEONID: Leonid, please call me Leonid.\nPERI: Only if you call me... Kristina.\nLEONID: Kristina. Your quarters, they are comfortable?\nPERI: Yeah, fine, thanks. Real home from home.\nLEONID: Doctor Kalashnikov, he is also comfortable?\nPERI: I wouldn’t know. I’ve barely seen him these last three days. He’s spent most of it holed up with Miss Petrov.\nLEONID: You don’t mind, him spending all his time with another woman?\nPERI: Why should I mind? Wait. You’re fishing, aren’t you?\nLEONID: Fishing?\nPERI: Trying to find out if the Doctor and me are a couple.\nLEONID: Well? Are you?\nPERI: No. He’s not my type. And the Doctor, well, I’m definitely not his type. He’s more interested in his work.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 27\nLEONID: And you? Are you also married to your work?\nPERI: No, I’m not married, to my work or anyone else. What about you? Do you have a girl back in Kirov?\nLEONID: Ah, no. Just my parents. Where are you from? Your accent\nLEONID: suggests you are not from Russia.\nPERI: No? Where does it suggest I come from?\nLEONID: Somewhere in the west, I think.\nPERI: The west?\nLEONID: Yes. Poland. Or one of the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia.\nPERI: Latvia, yes, that’s right.\nLEONID: So how does a girl from Latvia end up at Moscow university?\nLEONID: I’m sorry, if you will excuse me, I’m due back on guard duty.\nPERI: Don’t forget to keep warm.\nLEONID: I’1l do my best. Kristina.\nPERI: (QUIETLY, TO HERSELF) You’ve still got it, Peri. Wherever you go in the universe, there’s always one. (FINDS SOMETHING) Hey, Leonid, you left something? Leonid. (READS) Doctor Pushkin...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 28\nPERI: (QUIETLY) A key... “Research area four. One hour.”\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 29\nLARISA: You see the red button in front of you?\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Red? What is red?\nLARISA: The large button. That will replenish your water supply. As I told you two hours ago.\nLARISA: It’s as if she is a simpleton.\nDOCTOR: No. She’s been deprived of her autobiographical memories.\nLARISA: Deprived?\nDOCTOR: (WHILST WORKING ON A GADGET) Something happened to her, on the far side of the moon. Something that affected her mind.\nLARISA: Doctor, what is that?\nDOCTOR: What?\nLARISA: That device you have been working on during my rest periods. Using my laboratory and equipment.\nDOCTOR: Oh, just a computer circuit. You don’t mind, do you?\nLARISA: No, but Captain Kozlov might. He’s paranoid about security, if he thought you were making a radio —\nDOCTOR: He might take me for a spy?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 30\nSCIENTIST: Miss Petrov, Doctor Kalashnikov — it’s time.\nLARISA: Thank you. All right. Activate remote guidance system.\nSCIENTIST: Guidance system activated.\nLARISA: Prepare for lateral engine burn to correct course. One hundred percent for —\nDOCTOR: Eight seconds. Commencing, three, two, one... now.\nSCIENTIST: Commencing lateral engine burn... (FX: BLEEPING CHANGES PITCH, THEN JUST STATIC.) My God. It’s not responding. It’s not responding!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 31\nPERI: “Research area four. Authorised personnel only.”\nPERI: IN DARKNESS.\nPERI: (QUIETLY) Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?\nPERI: Spacesuits? Empty spacesuits? (BEAT) I don’t believe it. They’ve only gone and built a —\nALEXEI: Lunar landing module, Doctor Pushkin?\nPERI: What is this, some sort of secret research project?\nALEXEI: Of course. Didn’t you read the sign? Authorised personnel only. You are trespassing. In a restricted area.\nPERI: I am a doctor, sent here on the authority of the presidium —\nALEXEI: You don’t have to play games with me. I know who you really are.\nPERI: You do?\nALEXEI: I know you are not Doctor Kristina Pushkin. Despite what your identity papers may claim.\nPERI: Then who am I?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 32\nALEXEI: Who are you? Why, you are a spy, of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 33\nLARISA: (TO SCIENTISTS) Keep trying. If the capsule enters the atmosphere at the wrong angle it will burn up or bounce back into space.\nMIKHAIL: Miss Petrov, what’s happening?\nLARISA: We've lost contact with the capsule during a critical moment —\nMIKHAIL: And what is Doctor Kalashnikov doing?\nDOCTOR: Me? Spot of rewiring. You see, it appears the problem is at our end.\nLARISA: Our end?\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBS OUT FROM UNDER DESK) Our signal isn’t getting through. It’s not even being broadcast. (FX: PRESSING SWITCHES) But if I can re-route it through the second satellite dish —\nMIKHAIL: What do you mean it’s not getting through? Another malfunction?\nDOCTOR: I suppose that’s a possibility. Seems a trifle unlikely, though.\nLARISA: Then what are you saying? It was sabotaged?\nDOCTOR: (FX: FINISHES) We have more important things to worry about right now. Miss Petrov, if you could try again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 34\nLARISA: Activate guidance system.\nSCIENTIST: Guidance system — responding!\nMIKHAIL: So now what?\nLARISA: We have to calculate a new trajectory, but the computations will take an hour at least.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FRANTIC SCRIBBLING) Give me a few moments... Finished. Commence a twenty-second engine burn — now!\nSCIENTIST: Commencing engine burn.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) (TERRIFIED) What is happening? What are you doing? Help me!\nLARISA: It’s alright, we’re bringing you home.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Home? No. I don’t like it. Let me out! Let me out!\nDOCTOR: We will, very soon. You don’t have much longer to wait.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) No. Let me out now. Please!\nMIKHAIL: Doctor, where will the capsule come down?\nDOCTOR: By my reckoning about sixty kilometres due north of the cosmodrome, in just under an hour’s time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 35\nPERI: For the last time. I’m not a spy.\nALEXEI: You must forgive my melodramatics. I know you are a spy, because I was the one who sent for you.\nPERI: You sent for me?\nALEXEI: I contacted the KGB with my suspicions. They told me to expect two agents posing as scientific experts from Moscow university.\nPERI: What were these suspicions?\nALEXEI: I believed there was someone based in the cosmodrome who was passing on our research to a third party.\nPERI: ‘Believed’?\nALEXEI: I found proof. Valentina Cherlin. She gained access to the restricted area, this place. I found her taking photographs. She had already passed on the blueprints for the lunar module.\nPERI: Passed on to who?\nALEXEI: All I know is that they’re an agent working for the West. Valentina wouldn’t tell me any more than that.\nPERI: Maybe she’1ll talk to me. Where is she?\nALEXEI: I don’t know. I locked her in my quarters, told her what would happen if she did not cooperate, but when I returned she had gone.\nPERI: She escaped?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 36\nALEXEI: Or the enemy agent came for her.\nPERI: This Valentina, what is she like?\nALEXEI: She is small, attractive, about your age.\nPERI: (REALISING) And she disappeared... just before I got here.\nALEXEI: I know I should have questioned her more, used force... but I couldn’t do it.\nPERI: Why not?\nALEXEI: Because I loved her. That’s how she’d gained access to the restricted area, she had stolen my key. Valentina and I were lovers.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA TANNOY)\nMIKHAIL: Attention. All capsule recovery staff to go to departure point one. All medical staff on stand-by.\nPERI: That’s me, I have to go.\nALEXEI: But you and Doctor Kalashnikov, you will find the traitor? And\nALEXEI: Valentina?\nPERI: I can’t make any promises. But we’1ll do our best.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 37\nLARISA: (INTO RADIO) Five kilometres to landing site.\nDOCTOR: (OVER ENGINES) Larisa, there! Over there!\nLARISA: (INTO RADIO) Have spotted capsule vapour trail. Parachute has successfully deployed. Repeat. Parachute has successfully\nLARISA: deployed!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 38\nMIKHAIL: You can see the capsule itself? Over.\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Yes, it’s just hit the ground. Glowing hot but it appears undamaged. Over.\nPERI: What’s going on?\nMIKHAIL: Vostok seven’s returned to Earth.\nPERI: It has? Where’s the Doctor?\nMIKHAIL: With Miss Petrov, in the helicopter. What’s your status, over?\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Just coming in to land beside the capsule, over.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 39\nJUMP: OUT, ALONG WITH SOME SOLDIERS.\nLARISA: (OVER DIN) There it is, I can hardly believe it. The first man- made object to orbit the moon.\nDOCTOR: (OVER DIN) Let’s save the congratulations until we’ve got Marinka out, shall we?\nLARISA: If she’s still alive.\nDOCTOR: Try the radio.\nLARISA: This is Larisa Petrov calling Vostok seven. Can you hear me? Repeat. Can you hear me? Over.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Please. Let me out. Let me out of here!\nLARISA: She’s alive!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It certainly sounds like it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 40\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Cosmonaut Talanov is alive. I repeat. She’s alive! Over.\nMIKHAIL: Well done, Miss Petrov. Never doubted you for a moment. Proceed\nMIKHAIL: to open Vostok capsule. Over.\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Cutting hatch seals now, over.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 41\nLARISA: Hatch seals have now been cut. Over.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Then open the capsule. Get her out of there.\nLARISA: Opening hatch.\nLARISA: My God. I... I don’t believe it.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) What is it? Miss Petrov? Report. Report.\nLARISA: It’s absurd but.. Cosmonaut Talanov has gone. a dog inside her space suit!\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) A dog?\nDOCTOR: And not just any dog.\nLARISA: What?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you recognise it? It’s Laika.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR: Over.\nDOCTOR: There is... there\nDOCTOR: is\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 42"

Cosmonaut Talanov has gone. a dog inside her space suit!\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) A dog?\nDOCTOR: And not just any dog.\nLARISA: What?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you recognise it? It’s Laika. (REPRISE\nLARISA: There is... there is\nLARISA: ENDS. )\nLARISA: But that’s ridiculous. Someone must have interfered with the capsule, put the dog in there as some sort of joke.\nDOCTOR: When? We saw it land. We were the first to reach it.\nLARISA: Well, what do you think’s happened?\nDOCTOR: Someone did interfere with the capsule. When it was on the far\nDOCTOR: side of the moon.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 43\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) Let me out. Please. Let me out.\nLARISA: It’s Marinka. She must still be in the capsule.\nDOCTOR: No. There’s no-one else in there.\nMARINKA: (VIA RADIO) I can see you. Let me out.\nLARISA: Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Removing her helmet — ah!\nMARINKA: (VOICE AND RADIO) Thank you. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Whoever you are. Thank you.\nLARISA: The dog. It’s speaking. It’s speaking!\nDOCTOR: Yes. (TO LAIKA) Hello. I’m the Doctor. Tell me, how did you end up here?\nMARINKA: I... don’t remember.\nDOCTOR: Do you remember being sent into space?\nMARINKA: I remember being locked in a metal box. And then there was this screaming, crushing. I was so frightened. I thought I was going to die. And then I was alone. So alone...\nDOCTOR: I think that confirms it. This is Laika.\nMARINKA: Yes, yes. That is what they called me. Laika. I am Laika!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 44\nMIKHAIL: Laika?\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) I find it as hard to believe as you do, sir. Over.\nMIKHAIL: All right. Have the capsule brought to the quarantine area. I’1ll tell the medical staff to get ready.\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) Yes, sir.\nMIKHAIL: Until further notice, no-one is to have any contact with the occupant of the capsule. The fewer people who know about this, the better. Over.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) But General, you have to allow me to stay with her. She’s alone, she’s afraid, she —\nMIKHAIL: No, Doctor. You are not to speak to that animal again. Out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: CAGES. SCIENTISTS TRYING TO CALM THEM.\nMIKHAIL: What on Earth’s got into the other animals?\nLARISA: I’m not sure, General. They’ve been like this ever since... the “Cosmonaut Talanov” dog was brought in.\nMIKHAIL: Where is... she?\nLARISA: Through here.\nLARISA: OF OTHER ANIMALS.\nLARISA: I’ve had her restrained on an operating table for examination purposes.\nLAIKA: Who are you? Why have you done this to me? (STRAINS) Let me go!\nLARISA: We... er... We just want to find out about you. To work out what happened.\nMIKHAIL: And what you’ve done with Cosmonaut Talanov.\nLAIKA: You! I know you. You locked me into the metal box. It was you!\nLARISA: Seems she recognises you, General.\nMIKHAIL: Then she’ll know what happens if she doesn’t obey.\nLAIKA: No. Keep away from me! You left me to die!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 46\nMIKHAIL: What have you done with Cosmonaut Talanov?\nLAIKA: I don’t know!\nMIKHAIL: Where is she? Where have you been these last six years?\nLAIKA: I don’t know!\nLARISA: Maybe she genuinely doesn’t know, general. The amnesia —\nMIKHAIL: She hasn’t forgotten me, Miss Petrov. She’1ll tell us what we want to know. One way or another.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 47\nDOCTOR: Peri, let me get this straight. The Soviets have a prototype lunar landing module, hidden in a secret hangar?\nPERI: Yeah. Just like the Neil Armstrong one, all ready to go.\nDOCTOR: And the real Kalashnikov and Pushkin were KGB spies, sent to locate an enemy agent who had been receiving confidential information from — what was her name?\nPERI: Valentina Cherlin. The third girl we found, in the crashed car.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think it’s safe to conclude the enemy agent murdered her in order to guarantee her silence.\nPERI: But why kill Kalashnikov and Pushkin?\nDOCTOR: My guess is that Valentina found out that the two scientists on their way from Moscow were really KGB agents.\nPERI: So she told the enemy agent, who intercepted the agents’ car, and killed them along with Valentina herself.\nDOCTOR: Yes. They’re probably also responsible for sabotaging the radio relay to Vostok seven.\nPERI: But why do that? Why sabotage the Vostok mission?\nDOCTOR: To deprive the Soviet Union of a propaganda victory? Does seem a little drastic, I must admit.\nPERI: So now we have to pretend to be two KGB agents who are pretending to be scientists from Moscow!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 48\nDOCTOR: Yes. I recommend we, um, play our cards close to our chests.\nPERI: What about Laika? I mean... a talking dog? That just seems... crazy.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nPERI: What do you think happened there?\nDOCTOR: That I don’t know. And I won’t until I get the chance to question her properly. But... I’ve been forbidden from speaking to her.\nPERI: Maybe I could ask Captain Kozlov to sneak me in to the quarantine area? While you keep Miss Petrov occupied?\nDOCTOR: It’s worth a try. But don’t take any risks, if you get caught it will make our lives even more complicated.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 49\nLAIKA: Please... can I have some water?\nMIKHAIL: Not until you tell us what you’ve done with Cosmonaut Talanov!\nLAIKA: I don’t know. Please. Give me water.\nLARISA: We can’t withhold food and water, General. It would be inhuman.\nMIKHAIL: Inhuman? This is a dog we’re talking about! A mongrel from the streets of Moscow! A laboratory specimen you wouldn’t normally think twice about putting to sleep. That’s why we sent it into Space in the first place!\nLARISA: But now, I think she has a.. human level of consciousness.\nMIKHAIL: So we should start addressing her as Comrade Laika? Why stop there? Why not give her a parade through Red Square?\nLARISA: We must run more tests. Memory, intelligence. X-rays.\nMIKHAIL: And in the meantime we risk the news getting out and our becoming a international laughing stock. (BEAT) You have one day, Miss Petrov. One day!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 50\nLARISA: I’m sorry, Doctor. But you can understand the General’s position.\nDOCTOR: Something remarkable has happened here, Miss Petrov. Something... well, frankly miraculous. And he wants it killed\nDOCTOR: to avoid embarrassment? You have to let me speak to her.\nLARISA: I can’t do that. But I’d like to know what you make of this. Her x-rays.\nDOCTOR: Well that explains how she can talk.\nLARISA: It does?\nDOCTOR: Look at the larynx.\nLARISA: But that’s —\nDOCTOR: Human, yes.\nLARISA: But Laika is speaking with Cosmonaut Talanov’s voice.\nDOCTOR: - Which explains where the larynx came from. The brain’s been surgically altered too. It seems to have had sections of a human brain grafted onto the cerebral cortex.\nLARISA: Something used Talanov for body parts, for this dog?\nDOCTOR: Gruesome, admittedly, but an incredible scientific achievement nonetheless.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 51\nLARISA: But who could do this? What could do this?\nDOCTOR: Nothing of this Earth... or this time.\nLARISA: Right... And why?\nDOCTOR: Ah. That is the question. Wait! Presumably one of the objectives of this mission was to map the lunar surface?\nLARISA: Yes, of course —\nDOCTOR: Have you had the photographs developed?\nLARISA: No. Not yet, what with everything else, I’ve been too busy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 52\nALEXEI: (QUIET) I warn you, if General Leonov finds out about this —\nPERI: (QUIET) Yes?\nALEXEI: I will have to inform him that you and Doctor Kalashnikov are\nKGB: agents. And that you specifically requested to breach the quarantine.\nPERI: He won’t find out. I only want to talk to Laika.\nALEXEI: Laika?\nPERI: Just... wait out here.\nALEXEI: If I must. Have always hated this place, smells like an abattoir.\nPERI: Hello? Hello? Are you there?\nLAIKA: Who is it?\nPERI: My name is Per — Kristina. I’m a friend of the Doctor’s.\nLAIKA: The Doctor. What do you want?\nPERI: To help.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 53\nLAIKA: Help? Yes. You can help me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 54\nMIKHAIL: This had better be important, Miss Petrov, to drag me out of bed at midnight.\nLARISA: It’s important. We’ve had the photographs taken by Vostok seven developed.\nMIKHAIL: We?\nDOCTOR: My idea. Just look at them.\nMIKHAIL: I am not an astronomer, craters mean nothing to me.\nDOCTOR: Look closer. This picture of the Izsak-Delport crater.\nLARISA: Doctor, this is the first time anybody has seen the far side of the moon, we haven’t started naming it yet.\nDOCTOR: Well I have. General?\nMIKHAIL: What am I looking for? (BEAT) Wait, what’s that?\nLARISA: It’s not a geological feature. The Doctor thinks that small white circle might be a flying saucer.\nMIKHAIL: You got me out of bed for this? This is ridiculous.\nDOCTOR: More ridiculous than your cosmonaut being replaced with a dog? More ridiculous than that dog being augmented with your missing cosmonaut’s larynx and brain?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 55\nMIKHAIL: You think ‘aliens’ did this?\nLARISA: It’s beyond our science, and the Americans’.\nMIKHAIL: So if it is a flying saucer, what do you propose we do about Zt?\nDOCTOR: I propose we go and take a closer look.\nMIKHAIL: You want to go to the moon?\nDOCTOR: Yes. After all, you’ve already got everything prepared, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 56\nLAIKA: (DRINKS) Thank you. But if you want to help... set me free.\nPERI: I don’t think I can.\nLAIKA: I’ve done nothing wrong. I just want to go. To see the sky, to breathe fresh air, to run through the snow. Like I did, when I was young.. when I begged for scraps.\nPERI: But you’re not the same dog you once were. You can think now, you can talk.\nLAIKA: And for that I should be punished? (STRUGGLES)\nPERI: What did this to you? Something must have rescued you.\nLAIKA: Release me, let me go with you, and I will tell the Doctor.\nPERI: The Doctor?\nLAIKA: He showed me kindness. I trust him. But you will have to carry\nLAIKA: me, I don’t think I’1l be able to walk on my own.\nPERI: All right, hold still.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 57\nMIKHAIL: How did you find out about the lunar module?\nDOCTOR: How do you think? It’s the reason why I was sent here. (FX:\nTAPS: MODULE) Yes, it looks serviceable enough. Intended for Vostok eight?\nLARISA: Yes. A rocket would carry two cosmonauts into orbit around the moon, where they could then use this module to land.\nDOCTOR: And I presume you have a rocket all fuelled up and ready to go?\nMIKHAIL: We have a new Voskhod rocket prepared and on the pad, due for test launch in a couple of days’ time.\nDOCTOR: Then that sounds ideal. What do you say, Larisa? How do you fancy being the first woman to walk on the moon?\nLARISA: You are suggesting that I go?\nDOCTOR: Can you think of anyone more qualified? After all, you’re hardly going to let me go on my own, are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 58\nPERI: There you go.\nLAIKA: That’s better, can stretch my legs, can — (ATTACKS PERT)\nPERI: (BEING ATTACKED) What are you doing?\nLAIKA: I must be free! Free!\nLAIKA: IN A FRENZY.\nALEXEI: Kristina, what’s going on, all the animals have gone crazy.\nLAIKA: Yes. Because they know that I’m here.\nALEXEI: What the —\nLAIKA: I recommend you run, human, if you don’t want to be torn to pieces.\nALEXEI: Stay back. Stay back!\nPERI: Alexei! Don’t shoot her.\nALEXEI: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB)\nPERI: You do that, and the sound will bring every guard running.\nALEXEI: Bit late for that.\nPERI: Then we’d better not hang around! Come on!\nLAIKA: Yes, go. Leave me! Run!\nALEXEI: (QUIETLY) I suppose she can’t do much damage. We can seal\nALEXEI: place from the outside.\nLAIKA: You think I won’t be able to find my way out?\nLAIKA: this\nLAIKA: Don’t worry, my comrades. Soon you will be free... and reborn!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 60\nLARISA: That’s the quarantine alarm.\nDOCTOR: Don’t look at me, I was with you the whole time.\nMIKHAIL: Security to quarantine section. Status report.\nLEONID: (VIA RADIO) It’s the animal testing laboratory, sir. Something’s happening\nLEONID: down there.\nMIKHAIL: What? What’s happening?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 61\nLEONID: Not sure, sir. When we got here the room had been sealed from the outside.\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) What about the security camera?\nLEONID: It’s blacked out, they all seem to be — wait, Captain Kozlov is here, with Doctor Pushkin.\nALEXEI: Sir, it appears that someone... broke into the laboratory and\nALEXEI: released Laika.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) What?\nALEXEI: Hearing the alarm, Doctor Pushkin and I went to investigate —\nPERI: - and Laika was there. She tried to attack us.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) Laika tried to attack you?\nPERI: Yes, Doctor. It was like she was rabid or something.\nALEXEI: Sergeant Kurakin. Round up a security team.\nLEONID: Yes, sir. (BEAT) What for, sir?\nALEXEI: What do you think? We’re going back in there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 62\nDOCTOR: Captain, I'd be very careful if I were you. It’s possible Laika may have got free under her own steam.\nLARISA: What are you talking about? That dog was restrained.\nDOCTOR: If her intelligence was improved, maybe her strength was too.\nLARISA: Or maybe it was the work of our mysterious saboteur.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 63\nALEXEI: All right, Sergeant. Open the door.\nLEONID: There’s nothing in there. All the animals have gone!\nALEXEI: The cages are open. What could have done this?\nPERI: I guess Laika was clever enough to figure out a few latches.\nALEXEI: Then where is she now?\nLEONID: Here sir!\nPERI: The wall panel, it’s been ripped open...\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Captain, report!\nALEXEI: All the specimens have escaped with Laika, sir. They managed get into the ducting... they could be anywhere.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Then track them down, captain. I want those animals caught!\nMIKHAIL: to\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 64\nDOCTOR: Captain Kozlov still hasn’t found them?\nPERI: No. But they have got a whole town to hide in.\nDOCTOR: And Laika’s intelligence to guide them.\nPERI: Doctor, she threatened to tear us to pieces. She might be clever, but she’s still an animal at heart.\nDOCTOR: And now she’s got herself a gang of followers. You’1l be careful while I’m away, won’t you?\nPERI: You’re not still planning on going up in a rocket?\nDOCTOR: Of course. I’m rather looking forward to it.\nPERI: Haven’t we got enough to deal with down here?\nDOCTOR: No. Because whatever was responsible for what’s happening down here is up there, on the moon.\nPERI: I’m amazed Miss Petrov agreed to let you go.\nDOCTOR: So was she when she saw my test results. She was reluctantly forced to admit I was the most qualified candidate. Slightly more qualified than Yuri Gagarin was, in fact.\nPERI: I’d feel happier if I was going with you.\nDOCTOR: Only room for two, unfortunately. And besides, as a KGB agent, you have your own investigations to be getting on with...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 65\nSCIENTIST: Time to launch, one hundred seconds.\nMIKHAIL: What is capsule status, over?\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) All systems normal.

Ten!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB)\nPERI: What’s happening?\nMIKHAIL: Radio black-out. It is to be expected.\nMIKHAIL: Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 70\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE\nMAINTENANCE: There she goes. The first rocket to send men to the moon. And\nMAINTENANCE: we were here to see it.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER TWO While repairing a leaking oil pipe. Or at least one of us was.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE Still, it will be something to tell our grandchildren.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER TWO (WORKING) I can believe a man will walk on the moon, Arkady, but I cannot believe you will ever have grandchildren.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE Hello there little doggy. Good boy.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER TWO Careful, he might be wild.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE No, he just wants to play, don’t you? (WHISTLES ENCOURAGINGLY )\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE (BIT) Ow! You stinking cur!\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER TWO There are more of them. (FEARFUL) No. Keep back! Back!\nLAIKA: You think you can give us orders, human?\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER TWO What the hell? A talking dog?\nLAIKA: Oh, I can do more than talk. I can bite.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 71\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE & TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 72\nALEXEI: And by the time the guards got there, the two men had gone.\nMIKHAIL: What do you mean, ‘gone’?\nALEXEI: The dogs had dragged their bodies away, we don’t know where. watched the whole thing on the security cameras.\nPERI: And you’re sure Laika did this?\nALEXEI: Oh, yes. She was leading the pack.\nMIKHAIL: This has gone on long enough, sergeant. Until those animals have been destroyed, this cosmodrome is to be placed on emergency alert. No-one is to enter or leave or make any contact with the outside world.\nALEXI: Very good, sir.\nMIKHAIL: And from this moment on, enforce a total curfew. No-one is to\nMIKHAIL: be allowed out of their homes during the hours of darkness. Anyone found breaking the curfew will be shot!\nMIKHAIL: I\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 73\nFEMALE: WORKER No, I can’t let you out, Shusha. No walks tonight. No!\nFEMALE: WORKER I’m sorry, but there is a curfew. Now go to bed. Go to bed.\nFEMALE: WORKER Shusha. I’m telling you. Bed.\nFEMALE: WORKER\nFEMALE: (BEING SAVAGED) Shusha. Get down. Bad dog! Down! Down! (BANGS HEAD ON WALL, FALLS UNCONSCIOUS )\nLAIKA: Leave her, my comrade. Your revenge can wait. You must join us now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 74\nPERI: Another one?\nLEONID: I’m afraid so, General Leonov is trying to keep it quiet, but that’s the sixth person we’ve lost. And it’s not just the lab animals. Domestic pets, even our own guard dogs, they’ve all turned against their owners, escaped, and joined with Laika.\nPERI: But why attack people?\nLEONID: For food, presumably. Sorry, I didn’t mean to put you off —\nPERI: No, it’s fine, I turned vegetarian a while back.\nLEONID: Probably wise. You should see the stuff they feed us.\nPERI: Here, have mine. Pay you back for keeping me company.\nLEONID: It is a pleasure, not a duty. To spend time with the prettiest girl from Latvia.\nPERI: Excuse me. I’m a highly-qualified doctor from Moscow university.\nLEONID: Doesn’t stop you being a pretty girl, or from Latvia. I’m sorry. You are worried about your friend?\nPERI: Wouldn’t you be? He’s been gone three days.\nLEONID: Where is the capsule now?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 75\nSCIENTIST: Approaching lunar orbit. Thirty minutes to radio silence.\nMIKHAIL: Status, Cosmonaut Petrov?\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) All systems normal... We’re in the wrong alignment to see the\nLARISA: moon but we can see the Earth.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 76\nLARISA: It’s like a blue marble in the darkness. All of history, all of creation, all the achievements of the human race, and I can cover it with one finger. I’m glad I lived to see this.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Remember, you will have to adjust course while you are on the far side of the moon to maintain lunar orbit.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’ve already made all the necessary calculations. Nothing could be simpler!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 77\nALEXEI: Do you like taking risks, Doctor Pushkin?\nPERI: No. I realise that this is breaking the curfew, but —\nALEXEI: Getting caught isn’t what worries me. It’s Laika.\nPERI: Are you scared?\nALEXEI: She has managed to kill, slaughter some of my best men. So you\nALEXEI: will understand if I do not wait around.\nPERI: You have the master-key?\nALEXEI: Here. The apartment of the late Valentina Cherlin. I don’t know what you hope to find, I’ve already had my men search it.\nPERI: Then me taking a look can’t do any harm, can it?\nALEXEI: You have thirty minutes. Until then, Doctor.\nALEXEI: CUPBOARDS, DRAWERS.\nPERI: Come on, come on. There must be something here, some clue.\nPERI: (QUIET) Alexei, is that you?\nLEONID: I thought I might find you here, Doctor Pushkin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 78\nPERI: What?\nLEONID: You see, Kristina, I’ve worked it out. You’re not really a doctor at all. You’re a KGB agent.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 79\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Ten minutes to radio silence.\nDOCTOR: We know.\nLARISA: Repeating systems check. (FX: SWITCHES PRESSED) Everything normal.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Continue checking. This is the point where Vostok Seven experienced life support failure.\nLARISA: As if I didn’t know that.\nDOCTOR: Can’t blame him for being paranoid. Vostok Seven was functioning perfectly before everything went wrong too.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 80\nLEONID: I suspected something was odd, ever since I found you out on the steppe. So I kept an eye on you.\nPERI: And I thought you were just being attentive.\nLEONID: Captain Kozlov sent for you, didn’t he? That’s why you’re here. To find out why she disappeared.\nPERI: So now you know why I’m here, are you going to help me?\nLEONID: Of course, Kristina. If that is your name. What exactly were you hoping to find?\nPERI: We believe — well, Captain Kozlov believes — that Valentina was passing on secrets to an enemy agent in the base. They were having an affair, you see.\nLEONID: No. She was using Kozlov to gain access to confidential documents.\nPERI: What?\nLEONID: At least, that is what she wrote in her diary.\nPERI: Where did you get that?\nLEONID: She gave it to me before she disappeared. Told me to look after it, and give it to the KGB investigators if anything happened to her.\nPERI: You didn’t tell Captain Kozlov about it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 81\nLEONID: No. I couldn’t be sure he wasn’t the one responsible for her disappearance.\nPERI: Does the diary say who the enemy agent was?\nLEONID: No. It just mentions her work, and her meetings with her lover.\nPERI: Captain Kozlov.\nLEONID: No. Her real lover.\nPERI: You?\nLEONID: No, not me. She mentions in her diary, with regard to Captain Kozlov, how distasteful it was for her to be having a relationship with a man.\nPERI: (PENNY DROPS) Oh no.\nLEONID: What is it?\nPERI: I think I’ve just worked out who the enemy agent is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 82\nLEONID: Where exactly are we going?\nPERI: Mission control.\nPERI: What was that?\nLEONID: Laika and the other animals. They’re directly ahead of us.\nPERI: And getting closer. We’ll have to find another way around.\nLEONID: Back to the apartments. We can hold out there until dawn.\nPERI: There isn’t time. (SEES ANIMALS) Oh no.\nLEONID: We’re surrounded. We’ve walked into a trap.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 83\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Ten seconds to radio silence.\nLARISA: Until we speak again, General.\nDOCTOR: Right on cue!\nLARISA: And any moment now, we will be passing\nLARISA: into sunlight and see\nLARISA: the far side of the moon for the first time.\nDOCTOR: One hundred kilometres up. We should get a very good view.\nLARISA: And there it is.. a world of sheer mountain ranges and shadowy canyons. So cold and white. It is beautiful!\nDOCTOR: And deadly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 84\nPERI: You think you’1l be able to shoot our way out of this?\nLEONID: No, but I can try.\nLAIKA: Kristina.\nPERI: Laika. We mean you no harm. You have to let us go.\nLAIKA: You can go. You helped me. But the man... we need.\nLEONID: Yeah, for food.\nLAIKA: No. We have another use for you. Comrades... take him.\nLEONID: No wait, wait. Please.\nALEXEI: (SHOUTS) Quick! Well don’t just stand there! Get in!\nLEONID: Captain, just in time!\nOVER: CAR BANGING ON WINDOWS, MONKEYS SCREECHING, DOGS SNARLING.\nALEXEI: I warned you about wandering around at night. You both in?\nPERI: & LEONID Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 85\nALEXEI: Then let’s get out of here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 86\nLARISA: Approaching lunar orbit insertion point. Three. Two. One.\nDOCTOR: And... off.\nDOCTOR: Gyroscopes confirm five degree trajectory shift.\nLARISA: Then we’ve established a lunar orbit. We can rest.\nDOCTOR: Not just yet. We should be approaching visual range of that alien object in the minute or so.\nLARISA: You think we’ll be able to find it? It is just a mass of craters...\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think so. Telescope, telescope! (FX: OPENS TELESCOPE) Should be somewhere around... oh my word.\nLARISA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe it.\nLARISA: You’ve seen it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but I don’t believe what I’ve seen. A lunar base!\nLARISA: With the stars and stripes painted on the roof of the main dome. (FX: PISTOL COCKED) And now you’ve seen it, Doctor, you can never go home again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 87\nSCIENTIST: Time to radio contact.. thirty minutes.\nMIKHAIL: Assuming they’re still alive.\nMIKHAIL: What is the meaning of this —\nPERI: I have to call the capsule. I have to warn the Doctor.\nMIKHAIL: Warn him? What about?\nLEONID: Larisa Petrov. She’s a spy, working for the United States!\nMIKHAIL: What?\nPERI: So you have to let me call the capsule!\nMIKHAIL: But you can’t, it’s too late. It passed behind the moon fifteen minutes ago...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 88\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t fire that thing in here. One bullet hole in the capsule and we’1ll both be killed.\nLARISA: Then we will die together, and this will become one more failed mission for the Soviets to hush up.\nDOCTOR: Of course! That’s why you sabotaged Vostok seven. To make sure the Soviets didn’t find out about the American moonbase!\nLARISA: Orders straight from the White house. End the Soviet space programme once and for all. The president has promised the nation that we will win the race to the moon.\nDOCTOR: But you’ve already won it! You’ve built a base there!\nLARISA: Of course. He’d hardly make a promise he didn’t know he could keep.\nLARISA: BADLY.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing?\nLARISA: Burning up our remaining fuel. Keep still, Doctor. Or I will fire.\nDOCTOR: You’re altering our trajectory to a descent orbit. We’re going to crash into the moon’s surface!\nLARISA: Yes, Doctor. Think of it as an honour. You will be the first man ever to die on the moon.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 90"

They must have failed to establish a lunar orbit.\nALEXEI: What does that mean?\nMIKHAIL: It means either they overshot the orbital insertion point and kept on going... or the capsule has gone into a descent orbit.\nPERI: You mean, it’s going to crash into the moon?\nMIKHAIL: Given the choice, a quick death would be the merciful option.\nPERI: Can’t you send up another rocket?\nMIKHAIL: There is no other rocket. It would take weeks to prepare another mission.\nPERI: What are you talking about? You’ve got loads of other rockets here, I’ve seen them!\nMIKHAIL: What you have seen are Voskhod three-K-V intercontinental ballistic missile launchers. They’re not designed for spaceflight.\nLEONID: Kristina. You must accept it. We’ve lost him.\nPERI: No. The Doctor can’t be dead. He can’t!\nMIKHAIL: Captain Kozlov. As of now, Vostok missions seven and eight are to be struck from the official record. As far as anyone is concerned, they never took place!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 92\nOCCASIONAL: CREAK OF METAL.\nLARISA: (WAKING) What happened...?\nDOCTOR: You were knocked out. Not by me, I hasten to add.\nLARISA: My gun. Where is it?\nDOCTOR: In very small pieces. Hope you don’t mind, but firearms in enclosed spaces make me nervous.\nLARISA: We’re still on a descent orbit. I have to get to the lander!\nDOCTOR: There’s no need. Look at the altimeter.\nLARISA: Altitude thirty kilometres. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight... We’re going to crash!\nDOCTOR: No. We’re going down, true enough. But something is slowing our velocity.\nLARISA: What? But I burned all the fuel, the retro-rockets can’t fire.\nDOCTOR: No. It’s the result of some outside influence. A force field of some kind, I should imagine. We should be grateful. If it hadn’t intervened, we’d both be dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 93\nLEONID: I am sorry, Kristina, but the Doctor won’t be coming back.\nPERI: No. I’ve thought him dead dozens of times before, and he’s always turned up, out of the blue. Usually with a bad joke.\nALEXEI: Ah, Doctor Pushkin, I thought I might find you here. Sergeant, if you could return to your duties. Doctor Pushkin and I have private matters to discuss.\nLEONID: Yes, sir.\nPERI: What private matters?\nALEXEI: I must know. How did you find out that Larisa was an American\nALEXEI: spy?\nPERI: I.. well, I suppose it doesn’t matter now. She was ina relationship with Valentina, who loved her so much, she was prepared to do anything for her.\nALEXEI: So Valentina never had any feelings for me. I was an idiot to believe otherwise. So where is Valentina now?\nPERI: I don’t know any other way to tell you this. Valentina is dead.\nALEXEI: Dead?\nPERI: Yes. I think Larisa killed her.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 94\nALEXEI: So much for love.\nLEONID: Sir.\nALEXEI: Sergeant, I thought I told you —\nLEONID: Yes, sir. But it’s the animals. They... they seem to be preparing to attack.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 95\nLARISA: This force field is the work of extraterrestrials?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s beyond contemporary human technology. And we know that Vostok seven was subject to alien interference.\nLARISA: Because of what happened to Laika?\nDOCTOR: For it to have returned at all, its course must have been corrected when it was on the far side of the moon.\nLARISA: Cosmonaut Talanov could have made the correction.\nDOCTOR: No. Because by then she was already dead as a result of your sabotage.\nLARISA: In war, a number of... civilian casualties are to be expected.\nDOCTOR: What ‘war’?\nLARISA: The cold war. You remember, about a year ago, there was an international crisis due to events in the Bay of Pigs?\nDOCTOR: The Cuban Missile crisis, yes.\nLARISA: The world brought to the brink of nuclear conflict. And there were those in our administration who wanted to see that happen. They thought if they launched a pre-emptive strike, the Soviet Union wouldn’t be able to fight back.\nDOCTOR: But they stepped back from the brink.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 96\nLARISA: Because of intelligence warning them that the enemy was ready to respond in kind. If it wasn’t for people like me providing that intelligence then things would have been very different.\nDOCTOR: And that’s your justification for murdering Valentina?\nLARISA: I had no choice. She would’ve betrayed me, the KGB interrogators would’ve made sure of that.\nDOCTOR: Kalashnikov and Pushkin were interrogators?\nLARISA: With plenty of innocent blood on their hands. I did the world a favour by killing them. So you can imagine my surprise when you and “Doctor Pushkin” turned up. Made me wonder who you were working for.\nDOCTOR: And have you come to any conclusions?\nLARISA: I think you’re working for a third party. Because no US agent would be so foolish as to point out the location of our secret moonbase.\nDOCTOR: Speaking of which, there it is!\nLARISA: We’re being brought down beside it.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Right outside the front door!\nLARISA: Velocity still decreasing. Down to five metres a second.\nDOCTOR: Just as well, given that this capsule isn’t built for landing!\nLARISA: Altitude five metres. Four. Three. Two.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Brace yourself!\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well. I’ve had bumpier landings.\nLARISA: This is agent Topaz calling Moonbase Eisenhower. (NO REPLY) This is agent Topaz calling Moonbase Eisenhower. Please\nLARISA: respond!\nDOCTOR: It seems they’re not “picking up”.\nLARISA: There must be a fault with the radio.\nDOCTOR: Sabotage that as well, did you?\nLARISA: No, Doctor, I did not.\nLARISA: SWITCHES IT OFF.\nLARISA: Ow. (BEAT) So what do you suggest we do now?\nDOCTOR: We have spacesuits. We could always pop out and knock —\nLARISA: Oh no. The entry hatch, it’s opening!\nDOCTOR: What?!\nLARISA: But if it opens while we’re on the moon, we’1ll be dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 98\nDOCTOR: Are you sure about that?\nLARISA: The capsule hasn’t depressurised.\nDOCTOR: No. It seems someone wants us kept alive. Come on!\nLARISA: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Where do you think? Outside!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 99\nPERI: Oh great, now it’s snowing.\nALEXEI: Sergeant, binoculars.\nLEONID: Here, sir.\nLEONID: The animals have formed a perimeter around this building.\nALEXEI: Yes. It’s almost as if they’re waiting for something.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 100\nLAIKA: Now it is the humans turn to know what it is to be trapped.\nLAIKA: No, my comrade, we will not kill them. Not yet. Not until we have what we need.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MOON. FOOTSTEPS ARE SOFT LIKE ON A SANDY BEACH.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Miss Petrov. The weather’s fine.\nLARISA: We can breathe. There’s oxygen on the moon!\nDOCTOR: Provided for our benefit, I imagine. We’re enclosed in another force field.\nLARISA: Like the one that brought us down?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And it’s doing rather more than just providing us with air. By rights, standing here in direct sunlight, we should be being roasted alive. And blinded by the glare, for that matter.\nLARISA: So we can walk on the surface of the moon without pressure suits. It’s unbelievable. Miraculous.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is. A rare privilege.\nLARISA: It’s so... bleak. Like the Negev desert, just rocks as far as the horizon. And grey, there’s no colour anywhere. But it’s beautiful. So very beautiful.\nDOCTOR: “Here is no water but only rock, rock and no water and the cracked earth, ringed by the flat horizon only.”\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 102\nMIKHAIL: (VIA TANNOY)\nMIKHAIL: (INTO TANNOY) Attention all residents of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Until further notice, the curfew is extended to twenty-four hours. You are to remain in your homes. I repeat, remain in your homes.\nPERI: It’s mostly dogs and cats, with some monkeys. Can’t see Laika\nPERI: anywhere, though.\nLEONID: She must be out there somewhere.\nPERI: Then where is she? And how is she giving them instructions?\nLEONID: They just seem to understand what she wants, by instinct.\nPERI: .Like in the animal testing laboratory.\nLEONID: What concerns me is what she wants with us. What was it she\nLEONID: said? “We have another use for you.”\nPERI: Oh no. I think I might have an idea what it is.\nLEONID: Where are you going?\nPERI: (LEAVING) To check something.\nLEONID: Then I’m coming with you.\nPERI: Can’t get enough of me, huh?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 103\nLARISA: This force-field, how large do you think it is?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. But I get the impression it’s moving with us, like a spotlight.\nLARISA: Then whatever is creating it, knows we’re here.\nDOCTOR: Unnerving, isn’t it? It’s also exerting a gravitational influence. After all, we should be bounding across the lunar surface like slow-motion springboks.\nLARISA: Instead it feels like we’re still — (SEES SOMETHING) My God!\nDOCTOR: What is it? (SEES) Oh no.\nLARISA: There’s hardly anything of him left. Just a... mummified corpse in a spacesuit. (READS) Lieutenant Barney Schwartz.\nDOCTOR: The environment would account for the skeletal condition of the remains. He’s been repeatedly freeze-dried and baked.\nLARISA: But why would he go outside, and remove his helmet?\nDOCTOR: Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? What could be so bad that death was the preferable option?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 104\nLEONID: Where are we going?\nPERI: The animal testing laboratory.\nLEONID: But that whole section of the building has been sealed off.\nPERI: I guess they got back in the way the same way they got out.\nLEONID: We have to inform Captain Kozlov.\nPERI: You do that, I want to see what they’re doing in there.\nLEONID: The security cameras are out of order. But there’s an\nLEONID: observation room, up the stairs.\nPERI: Show me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 105\nDOCTOR: Hello? (BEAT) The lights are on but there’s no-one home.\nLARISA: If there was a radiation leak, they might have evacuated to a lower level.\nDOCTOR: Except they were experimenting with using reed palms to re- oxygenate the air. And they’re all in verdant health.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, what exactly was this place built for?\nLARISA: A shelter.\nDOCTOR: From what?\nLARISA: What do you think? Nuclear war.\nDOCTOR: So in the event of the balloon going up, the president and the first lady jump into a rocket to the moon?\nLARISA: This base can maintain a viable minimum population. So that, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, they can wait until the Earth has recovered, and then return and rebuild civilisation.\nDOCTOR: And you constructed your “Noah’s ark” on the far side of the moon to avoid detection?\nLARISA: Of course. Otherwise it would be an obvious target.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 106\nLARISA: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think we’re alone down here. Look.\nLARISA: Dogs! Two dogs!\nDOCTOR: Well, they seem pleased to see us. (TO DOGS) Hello there!\nLARISA: Doctor. Laika wasn’t the only dog we sent into space.\nDOCTOR: No?\nLARISA: No. There were two more. Pchyolka and Mushka.\nDOCTOR: And here they are... (TO DOG) Who’s a cute little boy, then?\nLARISA: They can’t talk, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No. Not yet, at least.\nLARISA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: I have a suspicion that’s why we’ve been kept alive. To provide these dogs with our vocal cords and brains.\nLARISA: Doctor, this moonbase has its own rocket, we can use it to return to Earth.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 107\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that’1ll be possible.\nLARISA: What are you talking about? We can just go back the way we came — (FINDS IT HARD TO MOVE AS SAYING THIS. FX: FEET SLIPPING)\nDOCTOR: Easier said than done.\nLARISA: It’s like climbing up a slope, I keep sliding back!\nDOCTOR: And yet the floor is perfectly level. Because the source of the gravitational pull isn’t below us, but at the other end of that corridor.\nLARISA: So we don’t have any choice. We have to go on.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And it’s downhill all the way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SHRIEKING, HOWLING ETC.\nMAINTENANCE: WORKER ONE AND TWO, OTHER HUMANS (SUFFERING, FRIGHTENED, CRYING) Help me, please, stop, what do you want, I beg you, no, no... (AD-LIB)\nLEONID: My God. They’re laying them out like they’re being prepared for some sort of medical operation.\nPERI: Yes. They don’t need them for food. They need them for spare parts.\nLEONID: This is Sergeant Kurakin calling Captain Kozlov. Over.\nALEXEI: (VIA RADIO) What is it, Sergeant? Over.\nLEONID: Sir, it’s Laika and the animals, they’ve made a sort of nest in\nLEONID: the testing laboratory.\nALEXEI: (VIA RADIO) Where are you exactly?\nLEONID: In the observation room, sir. Over.\nALEXEI: (VIA RADIO) Very good, I’m on my way. Out.\nLEONID: Kristina. We should get out of here while we still have the\nLEONID: chance.\nPERI: Yes, you’re right. I’ve seen enough.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 109\nPERI: (REACTS) Ah. Too late...\nLAIKA: Kristina. You should not have come here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 110\nWARPING: REALITY. VOICES ARE GIVEN UNEARTHLY REVERSE ECHO.\nDOCTOR: Well, I think we’ve found our alien.\nLARISA: This is it? A black sphere floating in mid-air?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s rather more than just a sphere. Try reaching towards its\nLARISA: My arm, it’s pulling... (PULLS BACK) It’s trying to drag me into itself!\nDOCTOR: A short-range gravitational field. I think what we’re looking at is a black hole.\nLARISA: (UNFAMILIAR WITH THE TERM) A ‘black hole’!?\nDOCTOR: (EXPLAINING) A collapsed star. You can see the light bending at the edge of the event horizon, turning red as the wavelength is stretched.\nLARISA: But if this was a ‘black hole’ we’d be sucked in and crushed to a Singularity in an instant.\nDOCTOR: If it had occurred naturally, yes. But this was manufactured.\nLARISA: Manufactured? What for?\nDOCTOR: To act as a sentinel? Or a probe?\nLARISA: A probe? You mean that thing is watching us?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 111\nDOCTOR: In a sense. It’s certainly absorbing all the light.\nLARISA: Along with all electromagnetic waves. Radio and television!\nDOCTOR: Yes. All stored for future reference.\nLARISA: Stored?\nDOCTOR: A black hole doesn’t destroy information. It’s all retained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. On a quantum level.\nLARISA: What?\nDOCTOR: Stephen Hawking will explain later. The principle is, any information which enters a black hole can, in theory, be retrieved.\nLARISA: The crew of the moonbase! You think they might be in there?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. They may even still be alive, albeit in a very flat, holographic state. (HAS IDEA) I wonder.\nLARISA: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: An intelligence test. This computer circuit’s damaged but not beyond repair. Now, let’s see what this probe makes of it.\nDOCTOR: (CATCHES CIRCUIT) Ha!\nLARISA: It threw it back out!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 112\nDOCTOR: On the exact opposite trajectory. Newton’s third law in action. But look. It’s all been completely repaired. As good as new.\nLARISA: This black hole... it can mend things?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s programmed not only to observe but also to intervene and improve. Which explains a great deal.\nLARISA: Doctor. That thing, whatever it is, brought us here. It won’t let us go. And sooner or later we’1ll both be dragged in.\nDOCTOR: Yes. So if one’s going to go, one might as well (RUNS) go out in style! (JUMPS) Wooooah!\nDOCTOR: AS HE ‘FALLS’. BURST OF FEEDBACK NOISE.\nLARISA: Doctor! (BEAT) What sort of idiot jumps into a black hole?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 113\nLEONID: Take one step closer and I’11 shoot.\nLAIKA: I believe you would, too. I can smell your fear.\nPERI: Just let us go, and nobody need get hurt.\nLAIKA: Humankind condemned me to die. Why should I show them any mercy?\nPERI: Because that would make you better than them.\nLAIKA: I don’t want to be better than them. I want to take their place in the order of things.\nLEONID: What are you talking about?\nLAIKA: The natural order. You have used us for experimentation. Caged us. Tortured us. Stuck electrodes in our brains. But now it is time for a revolution. For animal-kind to rise up and take this world.\nPERI: And the human race? What happens to them?\nLEONID: Isn’t it obvious? She wants us killed.\nLAIKA: No. Not killed. You will be.. farmed. Kept in cages, fed till you are mature, when your body parts can be harvested.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 114\nMYRIAD: HAUNTING ALIEN EFFECTS.\nDOCTOR: Hello? I just want to talk. To find out why you’re here?\nEARLY: ROCK’N’ROLL. CROWDS AT FOOTBALL MATCHES, AUDIENCES\nRADIO ANNOUNCER ONE: - Finisterre and Biscay, winds moderate. Rockall, gale warning.\nRADIO ANNOUNCER TWO: And as Maurice Leyland steps up to the wicket —\nDOCTOR: I see. You picked up our broadcasts, and came to investigate...\nDOCTOR: Oh. Not just to investigate. To offer your assistance.\nDOCTOR: If you deemed the human race worthy of your help.\nDOCTOR: But the first thing you found was Laika, alone and afraid.\nDOCTOR: CROWD AT A NAZI RALLY HEILING IN UNISON, CRYING BABIES, AND ANIMALS IN DISTRESS, PLUS:\nGERMAN RADIO ANNOUNCER: - der verlust des lebens in der bombardieurng Dresdens —\nDOCTOR: And you deemed the human race unworthy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 115\nLAIKA: I have been granted a glorious vision. When animal-kind rules the Earth there will be no more war, no more suffering!\nPERI: Well I don’t think much of it so far.\nLAIKA: You alone will be spared. But this man, we need.\nLEONID: You try anything, and I’11 kill you.\nLAIKA: And if I am dead, I will not be able to prevent my comrades from ripping you both to pieces.\nPERI: What was that?\nLEONID: Sounds like Captain Kozlov.\nLAIKA: Comrades! Back to the laboratory! We must secure our territory. We can deal with these humans later.\nPERI: They’re going. Leonid. This is our chance. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 116\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. I’m not human, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, but I’ve spent a great deal of time on their planet, and over that time I’ve found there is far more to the human race than meets the eye. They are capable of great cruelty, yes, but they are also capable of great compassion. Look at your records of the recent war; see how many gave their lives in the name of ending tyranny. See how many are now working to preserve the planet, and all the life upon it. You’ve come to Earth in one of its most turbulent periods. It won’t always be like this. I’ve seen the future and I know the human race will achieve great things. And when they do finally reach out to the stars it will be in the name of peace. You just have to give them a chance.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 117\nALEXEI: Men, on my word. Take aim. Fire!\nSOLDIER: It’s no good, sir. Whenever we shoot one lot, there’s another\nSOLDIER: right behind them.\nALEXEI: Then you’1ll just have to keep shooting, won’t you?\nLEONID: Sir!\nALEXEI: Hold your fire! Sergeant, Doctor Pushkin, quick, get out of the way!\nPERI: (RUNNING) All right, going as fast as I can!\nLEONID: Sir, you’re going to have to retreat, seal this whole area off.\nALEXEI: Oh no. This ends now.\nPERI: Leonid’s right, there’s too many of them, you won’t stand a\nPERI: chance.\nALEXEI: Sergeant, escort Doctor Pushkin back to mission control.\nLEONID: Yes, sir. Kristina!\nALEXEI: All right, men. Prepare to advance.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 118\nSOLDIER: Yes, sir!\nALEXEI: What’s that?\nSOLDIER: It’s coming from above us, sir. Something inside the ceiling.\nALEXEI: My God. Rats. It’s full of rats! Back everyone! Back!\nALEXEI: Stop firing, you fool, you’re shooting our own men. (BITTEN) No. Get off. Get off! (AAARGH)\nLAIKA: No. Do not kill this one, not yet. We need him taken alive.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 119\nDOCTOR: (FALLING THEN LANDING) Woah! Well, I’ve never done that before.\nLARISA: Doctor. You’re.. alive.\nDOCTOR: Cogito Ergo Sum, yes, I suppose I must be.\nLARISA: The black hole released you.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I offered it a deal.\nLARISA: A deal?\nDOCTOR: It has consented — very generously — to allow us to return to\nDOCTOR: Earth in one of the American rockets.\nLARISA: Why?\nDOCTOR: To demonstrate that the human race is worth saving. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB)\nALEXEI: What are you doing? What do you want with me?\nLAIKA: Page 120\nLAIKA: Your vocal cords. And your brain. (BEAT) Comrade, pass me the\nLAIKA: surgical knife, could you?\nLAIKA: Thank you.\nALEXEI: Please. Don’t do this. You don’t have to do this.\nLAIKA: Don’t worry, human. You won’t suffer for very long.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 121\nLARISA: Doctor. Are you sure you know what you’re doing?\nDOCTOR: Of course. Once you’ve flown one rocket, you’ve flown them all.\nLARISA: How do I know I can trust you?\nDOCTOR: Well, I could’ve left you behind on the moon, couldn’t I? More to the point, how do I know I can trust you?\nDOCTOR: I recommend you strap yourself in.\nDOCTOR: Five, four, three, two, one. Firing ascent rockets!\nDOCTOR: Lift off!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 122\nMIKHAIL: Well, Sergeant?\nLEONID: I’ve put the men on guard around mission control, as ordered.\nMIKHAIL: So those things can’t get in here?\nLEONID: No, sir.\nPERI: And we can’t get out. And while this place is under quarantine,\nPERI: there’s no hope of rescue.\nMIKHAIL: We will survive. We have enough food and water to last — [us]\nSCIENTIST: General Leonov!\nMIKHAIL: What is it?\nSCIENTIST: A radio signal, sir. Coming from the moon.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) This is Cosmonaut Kalashnikov calling Baikonur control.\nPERI: The Doctor! He’s alive!\nMIKHAIL: Give that to me. (INTO RADIO) This is Baikonur control. What is your status, over?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 123\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s a long story, but we’re both safe and well.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Both of you? Is Miss Petrov with you?\nDOCTOR: She is. Say hello, Larisa.\nLARISA: Cosmonaut Petrov reporting.\nPERI: (VIA RADIO) But Doctor. She’s the one, the one who — [murdered]\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. But all that will have to wait until we’ve got\nDOCTOR: back to Earth. How are things down there with you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 124\nCOMPUTERS: BLEEPING, TAPE SPOOLS WHIRRING, PHONES RINGING.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Not good. There’s been a — [breach of]\nPATTERSON: What is this? What’s going on? Lieutenant?\nANDREWS: The two soviet cosmonauts. They appear to have... taken command\nANDREWS: of one of our lunar rockets. US rocket Lincoln.\nPATTERSON: Then they must know about moonbase Eisenhower.\nANDREWS: Yes, sir.\nPATTERSON: Lieutenant, get me the president. This is a code red.\nANDREWS: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) I see. Well, all I can suggest is that you sit tight and wait\nDOCTOR: for us to return.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 125\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) But Doctor. At the moment, no-one can enter or leave the Cosmodrome.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, we’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to\nDOCTOR: it. We’ve got three days, after a11..\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 126\nANDREWS: General!\nPATERSON: Yes, Lieutenant?\nANDREWS: The president has given the go-ahead for the hi-jacked rocket to be destroyed with the A one-nineteen, sir.\nPATERSON: Very good. Commence launch preparations.\nANDREWS: Yes, Sir. (BEAT) Sir, what actually is the A one-nineteen?\nPATERSON: A nuclear missile we developed a few years ago, to fire at the moon as a show of strength. Now we have a new target, and just under seventy hours to get it ready for launch.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 127\nLEONID: Don’t worry, Kristina. Only a few more hours to wait, and they’1l be safely back home.\nPERI: Not before time. I’ve been going out of my mind, cooped up in here, I don’t even know what day it is any more. Meanwhile Laika’s had three days to do god knows what...\nSCIENTIST: General Leonov, sir!\nMIKHAIL: What is it? A problem with the rocket?\nSCIENTIST: No, sir. We’ve just had a telegraph from the Kremlin on the emergency line. Apparently the Oko early warning system has just detected a nuclear missile launch in the United States.\nMIKHAIL: What?\nSCIENTIST: And according to intelligence reports, it’s being fired at a US rocket which has been hi-jacked by two “Soviet cosmonauts”.\nMIKHAIL: What? We have to warn them.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 128\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Listen to me, the United States has just launched a nuclear missile directly at you.\nDOCTOR: Ah. How charming of them.\nLARISA: What do you propose we do about it? We don’t have enough fuel for evasive manoeuvres.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. We’re sitting ducks. General Mikhail, listen to me.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) I am listening.\nDOCTOR: You have to contact the Kremlin. Tell them to call the American president on the hotline, and get him to call off the attack!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 129\nANDREWS: General Paterson!\nPATERSON: Lieutenant?\nANDREWS: We've just had a message on the hotline from Moscow.\nPATERSON: Moscow?\nANDREWS: Yes, sir. They’re requesting the president abort the missile strike. They say they would regard any attack on the Cosmonauts as an act of war.\nPATERSON: Goddamn commies. Lieutenant, where exactly is the president now?\nANDREWS: The motorcade left Love Field airbase about forty minutes ago, so he should be somewhere in downtown Dallas.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 130\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Doctor. The Kremlin has been in contact with the Pentagon, they’re trying to contact the president now.\nDOCTOR: Then we should be all right... unless. Oh no. Oh no. Larisa. What time is it?\nLARISA: (CHECKS) Just coming up to.. half past twelve in the morning, Kazakhstan time. Why?\nDOCTOR: Today is November the twenty-third, nineteen sixty-three. And if it’s half past twelve in Kazakhstan, then in Dallas, Texas, it’s half past twelve in the afternoon on November the twenty- second.\nLARISA: So, what does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It means the president is never going to answer that call.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 131"

They say — they say he’s been shot...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 132\nDOCTOR: Assassinated. By a man called Lee Harvey Oswald. According to the history books at least. I’ve always meant to pop back and check.\nLARISA: But how can you possibly know any of this?\nDOCTOR: Because I’ve seen the future. A future that won’t happen if that missile hits us and triggers a nuclear holocaust.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Baikonur control calling US Rocket Lincoln.\nDOCTOR: Receiving.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) We've just heard from the Kremlin. John F Kennedy has been shot.\nLARISA: (QUIET) It’s true. You were right!\nDOCTOR: Then we can assume he’s not going to be in any fit state to call off the missile attack.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) No. I am sorry.\nDOCTOR: Unless. Why did the Americans fire at us in the first place? How did they know we were on board?\nLARISA: I suppose they must’ve been monitoring our radio transmissions.\nLARISA: Exactly. So you can tell them who you are.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 133\nLARISA: What? Oh no — [Doctor]\nDOCTOR: If they knew this rocket was being piloted by one of their own agents, rather than a Soviet Cosmonaut —\nLARISA: So when we return to Earth, the KGB can have me executed.\nDOCTOR: What was it you said before?

We’ve entered the Earth’s atmosphere.\nLARISA: Velocity twenty-eight thousand. Twenty seven.\nDOCTOR: Time we strapped ourselves in. Things might get a little\nDOCTOR: bumpy!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 143\nMIKHAIL: (INTO RADIO) We have you on radar. Dead on course.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) (BUFFETED) That’s not a very comforting expression right now!\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) (BUFFETED) Velocity down to twenty-five thousand. G-force now at three g. Three point four. Five.\nMIKHAIL: Hold on. You’1ll be home and dry, soon enough.\nLARISA: (VIA RADIO) (BUFFETED) And then what will you do with me? Hand me over to —\nMIKHAIL: Baikonur Control calling re-entry capsule, please respond.\nDOCTOR: (VIA RADIO) (BUFFETED) Larisa’s blacked out. G-force too great. Not sure how long I’1l be — [able to]\nMIKHAIL: Cosmonaut Kalashnikov. Please respond. Please respond!\nPERI: What’s happening?\nMIKHAIL: They’ve just commenced re-entry.\nPERI: So why aren’t they answering?\nMIKHAIL: An ionisation black-out. Don’t worry, we should regain contact when the parachute deploys. When their problems really begin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 144\nLEONID: General. Doctor Pushkin has a suggestion how we might get be able to get out of here.\nMIKHAIL: Go on.\nPERI: We still have power. And we’re still breathing because of the air-conditioning system, right?\nMIKHAIL: You’re not suggesting we try to escape through the ventilation ducts?\nPERI: No. What I’m suggesting is, we pump sleeping gas through the air-conditioning system to knock all the animals out.\nMIKHAIL: What about us? Won’t we be knocked out too?\nPERI: No. There are some spacesuits in research area four, with the prototype lunar landing capsule. They have their own oxygen supply!\nMIKHAIL: It’s an idea. And if we used enough gas in sufficient concentration we could put the animals to sleep permanently.\nLEONID: Sir, there aren’t enough spacesuits for everyone in the building. A lethal amount for the animals would be lethal for them too.\nPERI: You only have to knock them out, you don’t have to kill them.\nMIKHAIL: Yes, you’re right... Once they’re out cold, we can just shoot them where they lie.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 145\nLAIKA: All the monkeys are now armed?\nALEXEI: We are, comrade Laika.\nLAIKA: Then it is time we went on the attack. (ORATION) Comrades! This world is ours for the taking. And we will take it, by tooth and by claw, by sweat and by the blood of our enemies!\nLAIKA: Do not kill the defenceless. We shall use them to give the rest of us mind and voice. But to those who would kill us, those who have captured and tortured us, we will show no mercy. Vengeance will be absolute. In the name of animal-kind!\nANIMALS AND ALEXEI: Animal-kind!\nLAIKA: (QUIETER) Let the natural order be restored.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 146\nPERI: (EFFORT) Remind me again why I suggested this.\nLEONID: (PASSING CANISTER) Here. Because we don’t have any choice.\nPERI: Good point. Okay. Here goes.\nLEONID: Shouldn’t be long till it has an effect.\nMIKHAIL: You’ve started pumping the gas?\nLEONID: Yes, sir.\nMIKHAIL: Not before time. It looks like the animals are moving to attack.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 147\nLAIKA: This is it, my comrades. That door is all that stands between us and the humans. Monkeys! Proceed through the air vents and force it open from the inside!\nALEXEI: & OTHER SOLDIERS Yes, comrade Laika!\nLAIKA: What is the matter with them?\nALEXEI: They say they are feeling sick. They say their heads hurt.\nLAIKA: Gas! The humans must be using gas!\nALEXEI: I can’t smell anything.\nLAIKA: Carbon dioxide. We must move outside, my comrades. Outside! Quickly!\nALEXEI: It’s too late... can barely stay awake...\nLAIKA: Then I will carry you, my comrade. We shall continue this fight together, you and I!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 148\nLEONID: (HELMET ON) You okay in there?\nPERI: (HELMET ON) I can breathe, which is the main thing.\nSCIENTIST: (VIA RADIO) General Leonov?\nMIKHAIL: (HELMET ON) Yes, what is it?\nSCIENTIST: (VIA RADIO) The gas, it’s working. The animals are collapsing But it’s\nSCIENTIST: starting to affect us up here, sir.\nMIKHAIL: (HELMET ON) Hold on. I’1l be with you in a few minutes with some oxygen.\nMIKHAIL: (HELMET ON) You can turn off the gas now, it’s done its work.\nLEONID: (HELMET ON) Yes, sir.\nMIKHAIL: (HELMET ON)\nMIKHAIL: Sergeant Kurakin. Take Doctor Pushkin to rendezvous with the re-entry capsule.\nLEONID: (HELMET ON)\nLEONID: Very good, sir. Come on, Kristina, we can get out through the\nLEONID: quarantine area.\nPERI: (HELMET ON) Easier said than done inside this thing...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 149\nLARISA: (WAKING) What happened?\nDOCTOR: The deceleration g-force. Knocked us both out.\nLARISA: Parachute deployed. Altitude five hundred metres. Four ninety.\nDOCTOR: Yes, soon be back on solid ground.\nLARISA: The solid ground that’s currently rushing up to meet us.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Baikonur control calling re-entry capsule. Baikonur control —\nDOCTOR: Receiving you. We should be landing in just over a minute.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) We have your location on radar. Sergeant Kurakin and Doctor Pushkin are already on their way to meet you.\nDOCTOR: You managed to get out of mission control? What about Laika and her followers?\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) No longer a problem, Doctor. We had them... put to sleep.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 150\nWEARING: SPACESUITS.\nPERI: (SHIVERS) One thing you can say for those spacesuits, at least they keep out the cold.\nLEONID: Give the engine a few minutes, we’ll warm up soon enough.\nPERI: You’re sure the animals are all still alive?\nLEONID: For the time being. I don’t know why you are so concerned about them. They’re only animals.\nPERI: It’s that attitude that kind of got us into trouble into the first place. Watch out —!\nLEONID: Was that — was that Laika?\nPERI: I don’t know, it’s too dark, it was moving too quickly.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Sergeant Leonid, do you read me, over?\nLEONID: I read you, sir. We made it outside and are now proceeding down Sovetskoy Armii. Over.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Excellent. The re-entry capsule has just come to ground, at co- ordinates forty-five three by sixty-three three. Over.\nLEONID: Heading there now, sir. Out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOW. EXTREMELY WINDY.\nLEONID: Looks like they had a rough landing.\nPERI: But they’re okay. They have to be.\nLEONID: (INTO RADIO) (INTO RADIO) Sergeant Kurakin calling capsule. Approaching you now. Over.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there you are. We were starting to wonder where you’d got to!\nPERI: Doctor! You’re all right!\nDOCTOR: Well, to coin a phrase, we did come down to Earth with a bump but we’re still in one piece. Aren’t we, Larisa?\nLARISA: Yes. Must be our lucky day.\nLEONID: Larisa Petrov. I am placing you under arrest as an enemy of the soviet union.\nDOCTOR: That can wait until we’re back in the warm. We’ve had rather a\nDOCTOR: long journey.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 152\nLEONID: (VIA RADIO) Have just recovered the Doctor and Miss Pushkin, sir. Over.\nMIKHAIL: Good work, sergeant. Take them to the residential block and\nMIKHAIL: have Miss Pushkin locked in a storage room. Over.\nLEONID: (VIA RADIO) A pleasure, sir. Out.\nSOLDIER: (VIA RADIO) Calling General Leonov —\nMIKHAIL: Yes, what is it, over?\nSOLDIER: (VIA RADIO) Number two missile silo, sir. The dog Laika, it’s got inside.\nSOLDIER: Over.\nMIKHAIL: How the hell did it do that?\nSCIENTIST: (VIA RADIO) Not sure. There’s a monkey with it and —\nMIKHAIL: Missile silo, respond. Respond. Respond!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 153\nDOCTOR: You put all the animals to sleep? With knock-out gas?\nLEONID: We didn’t have much choice, Doctor. It was either us or them.\nDOCTOR: But they’re still alive, that’s the main thing.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) Sergeant Kurakin, do you read? Over.\nLEONID: (INTO RADIO) I hear you, sir. Over.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO) I need you to head to number two missile silo at once. Over.\nLEONID: Yes, sir. What for? Over.\nMIKHAIL: (VIA RADIO)\nMIKHAIL: That dog Laika has broken in, killing the guards on duty. Heaven knows what she’s trying to do. Over.\nLEONID: On my way, sir. Out.\nDOCTOR: Sergeant. What exactly is in this missile silo?\nLEONID: Half a dozen Voskhod three-K-V I-C-B-Ms.\nDOCTOR: Is mission control on the way? Can you drop us off?\nLEONID: It is, we’re nearly there. Don’t you want to come with me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 154\nDOCTOR: I’1ll join you just as soon as I can. There are others who need saving first. And I’1ll need Larisa’s help.\nLEONID: If you insist.\nLARISA: I clearly have no say in the matter.\nPERI: Doctor. I’1ll go with Leonid.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nPERI: I’m the only one that Laika listens to. She won’t hurt me.\nDOCTOR: Very well. Try not to harm her, if at all possible.\nLEONID: This is as close as we get.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Sergeant. Good luck.\nLEONID: And you, Doctor.\nPERI: Bye.\nLEONID: What do you think the Doctor meant, others who need saving?\nPERI: How am I supposed to know? You just concentrate on driving.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 155\nLARISA: The food store? Doctor, what exactly are we doing here?\nDOCTOR: Keeping a bargain I made with the probe, making sure no more innocent creatures are killed.\nLARISA: It might help if you told me what you’re looking for?\nDOCTOR: Meat. Fresh, raw, meat!\nLARISA: Over here. Beef, lamb. Pork chops. What do you want them for?\nDOCTOR: Laika’s followers. They may have been augmented with extra intelligence but I doubt they can resist the prospect of a free lunch.\nLARISA: So.. you’re gonna feed them?\nDOCTOR: (GATHERING ITEMS) Not quite. I’m going to appeal to their baser instincts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 156\nLEONID: There she is! Up on the rocket access gantry!\nPERI: Laika?\nLEONID: Yes. But what’s she doing up there?\nPERI: Nothing good, I guess we can be sure of that.\nPERI: PRESSED.\nLAIKA: The warhead is armed?\nALEXEI: It is, comrade Laika.\nLAIKA: Then begin the countdown. Fifteen minutes will give us time to get out of range of the explosion.\nALEXEI: Yes, comrade. Fifteen minutes to detonation.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 157\nLARISA: Doctor, they’re waking up! The effects of the gas must be wearing off.\nDOCTOR: But they’re still groggy, luckily for us. Are you ready with the meat?\nLARISA: As I’1l1 ever be.\nDOCTOR: Okay. We have to make a trail to one of the jeeps, then we’1l drive dragging a couple of lamb chops behind us. Like a couple of Pied Pipers!\nLARISA: You realise this idea is utterly ludicrous and cannot possibly work?\nDOCTOR: Miss Petrov, those are my favourite kind of ideas.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 158\nLEONID: (REACHES TOP) That’s enough, Laika! Don’t move or I’11 shoot.\nLAIKA: You’re too late, human. Far too late.\nPERI: (REACHES TOP) We’re not here to hurt you. We’re here to help you. Just tell us what you want.\nLAIKA: What I want is justice. For myself and my comrades.\nPERI: Justice?\nLAIKA: To make sure that no others suffer as I have suffered. To end the work that is done here. The experimentation. The creation of weapons like these.\nLEONID: (REALISES) The warheads. You’re going to set off one of the nuclear warheads.\nLAIKA: The entire town will be incinerated in a ball of radioactive fire. Humankind will die by its own hand!\nPERI: Laika. You don’t have to do this.\nLAIKA: I’m sorry you will die, Kristina. But at least it will be instantaneous.\nLEONID: It’s not going to happen. Move away from the controls. I don’t want to have to shoot you, but I will if you don’t move away.\nLAIKA: Oh, human. You think I came here alone? Kozlov? Fire!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 159\nALEXEI: Yes, comrade!\nPERI: Leonid...?! (REALISATION; DISTRAUGHT) You killed him!\nLAIKA: We showed him mercy. He did not feel any pain.\nPERI: He didn’t deserve to die. To think I pitied you. You should’ve been left for dead in that rocket.\nALEXEI: Shall I execute the female too, comrade Laika?\nLAIKA: No. She’1ll be joining him soon enough. Now it is time we were gone. We will leave the female to grieve for her mate.\nMIKHAIL: (REACHES TOP) You’re not going anywhere, Laika.\nLAIKA: You. The one who placed me in the rocket. The one who condemned me to death!\nMIKHAIL: What else are dumb animals good for?\nLAIKA: You left me alone and afraid. You left me in pain. Tortured me. Me, and countless of my comrades!\nMIKHAIL: Your comrades?\nALEXEI: Remember me, General?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 160\nMIKHAIL: (AMUSED) A rhesus monkey. With the voice of Captain Kozlov!\nALEXEI: Not just his voice. His gun too.\nALEXEI: (KILLED)\nMIKHAIL: (HIT) (IN PAIN) My leg — my leg!\nLAIKA: Not so brave now, general. Now that you are a defenceless creature. How does it feel, to stare death in the face?\nMIKHAIL: No, keep back! Keep back!\nPERI: Laika, stop!\nMIKHAIL: (BEING SAVAGED) Kristina, get my gun, shoot her!\nPERI: I can’t reach it, it fell off the gantry.\nMIKHAIL: No, Laika, please, please I beg you —\nLAIKA: No mercy to humans! (LAUNCHES HERSELF AGAIN)\nLAIKA: LEONID, LAIKA\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 161\nLARISA: Where exactly are we going?\nDOCTOR: (DRIVING) Not far from where we discovered Miss Cherlin and Doctor Pushkin and Doctor Kalashnikov, remember them?\nLARISA: Of course, I’m not likely to forget.\nDOCTOR: Preying on your conscience, are they? Watch what you’re doing, the meat won’t leave a scent if it doesn’t make contact with the ground.\nLARISA: We’ve nearly run out. And they’ve nearly caught us up.\nDOCTOR: Which is just as well, because here we are.\nLARISA: Why here? There’s nothing here apart from... a little wooden hut.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 162\nDOCTOR WHO: PERI_\nDOCTOR WHO: Four minutes. Three minutes fifty-five. (TRYING BUTTONS)\nDOCTOR WHO: must be some way of stopping this thing.\nDOCTOR: Peri! Are you all right?\nPERI: Doctor, you’re too late.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean? What happened?\nPERI: There\nPERI: Leonid, Laika had him killed, then she attacked the general,\nPERI: and they fell.\nDOCTOR: I’m very sorry.\nPERI: But before she died she set the warhead to explode.\nDOCTOR: What? Hold on, I’1l just jump (JUMPS) over to you.\nPERI: (PUTTING ON BRAVE FACE) Neat trick, by the way, materialising\nPERI: the TARDIS in mid-air.\nDOCTOR: Would you rather I spent five minutes climbing a ladder? Now,\nDOCTOR: let’s see...\nPERI: Can you stop the countdown?\nDOCTOR: No. It’s been quadratic-locked. Laika must’ve been a mathematical genius.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 163\nPERI: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: Another ‘neat trick’. Back to the TARDIS.\nPERI: You’re not expecting me to jump over there?\nDOCTOR: It’s only a couple of feet.\nPERI: Across, yes. But it’s a long way down.\nPERI: What have you got in there, by the way?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t worry. They’re all very well-fed. Now, are going to jump or not?\nPERI: All right, I’m jumping, I’m jumping. (JUMPS) Maybe next time,\nPERI: you could land it a bit closer, that’s all.\nDOCTOR: One, two —(JUMPS) Of all the ungrateful —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 164\nDOCTOR WHO: OF DOGS, CATS AND MONKEYS, BARKING, MEWING, HISSING, WHOOPING.\nPERI: All the animals from the cosmodrome, you brought them in here?\nDOCTOR: Evidently. Call me Noah. I should warn you, there might be a little cleaning up to do afterwards.\nPERI: But why? What have you done it for?\nLARISA: Yes, I’d quite like to know the answer to that too.\nDOCTOR: You’ll see. But first there’s the small matter of this nuclear warhead to deal with —\nPERI: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Materializing us around the warhead itself. It’s now in one of the TARDIS store-rooms.\nPERI: So when it blows up, it’1ll blow up in here?\nDOCTOR: It shouldn’t come to that. I’ve placed it in a time-dilation field to slow the countdown.\nPERI: Right. So we can eject it once we’re in space?\nDOCTOR: That is one option, yes. But I have a better idea...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB)\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 165\nPERI: Where are we?\nLARISA: One of the lower levels of the American moonbase.\nPERI: The what? (BEAT) And what’s that!?\nDOCTOR: A black hole. The cause of all our problems.\nPERI: That’s a black hole? It’s a bit small, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Big enough. Now, if you’1ll excuse me for a moment.\nPERI: What the — Doctor! Where did he go?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 166\nDOCTOR: I’ve brought all the animals that were affected by Laika with me. If they remain on Earth, they will be destroyed. Not as a result of human cruelty, but your interference.\nDOCTOR: It’s time you took responsibility for your actions. Your presence nearly caused the extinction of life on Earth. Leave now. Take those whose lives you have changed with you. Take them to those who sent you, and give them a new life.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 167\nPERI: I don’t believe it. They’re all walking into the black hole. It’s swallowing them up!\nLARISA: So that’s why the Doctor brought them here.\nDOCTOR: Did somebody mention my name?\nPERI: Doctor. What’s going on here? What did you do?\nDOCTOR: I have persuaded our stygian friend here to leave, taking these poor animals with it.\nDOCTOR: Along with these two scamps! Pchyolka and Mushka. Off you go!\nLARISA: So you convinced it that humanity was worth saving?\nDOCTOR: Not me. It’s been monitoring events on Earth over the past few hours. Which have given it some pause for thought.\nPERI: The Kennedy Assassination?\nDOCTOR: The whole world united in grief and compassion. And it saw you, Miss Petrov, risking your life to prevent a nuclear war.\nLARISA: Just doing my job. Doctor. Where exactly is this alien probe going?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 168\nDOCTOR: Back to its world of origin, whereabouts unknown. Why?\nLARISA: I wonder if it has room for one more passenger. I don’t much fancy facing a KGB execution squad. (JUMPS) Goodbye, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Larisa, no!\nPERI: She’s gone!\nDOCTOR: Yes. But she’s not alone in there. She has the crew of this moonbase and a hundred-odd animals to keep her company.\nPERI: It’s disappeared, like it just... shrank away to nothing.\nDOCTOR: Voyaging, through strange seas of thought... Come on, Peri. we have a nuclear warhead to dispose of.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 169\nPERI: You're dematerialising — leaving the warhead in the moonbase?\nDOCTOR: Well, do you remember reading in your history books about an American base on the moon in nineteen sixty-three?\nPERI: No.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nPERI: But — [if it was]\nDOCTOR: It’s already done. (FX: SCANNER) Watch.\nRATHER: THAN THE ATMOSPHERE SO VERY DEEP AND BASSY.\nPERI: But won’t the Americans blame the Soviets for blowing it up?\nDOCTOR: I don’t see how. Out here on the far side of the moon, they won’t even have detected the explosion.\nPERI: But when they send another rocket to the far side of the moon —\nDOCTOR: All they’1ll see is one more crater amongst thousands. The result of a random meteorite impact.\nPERI: So no-one will ever set foot on the moon again until Neil\nPERI: Armstrong, in nineteen-sixty-nine?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Do you know, Peri, I’ve always meant to go and watch...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SPACE RACE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL-NB) Page 170\nARMSTRONG: (VIA RADIO)\nARMSTRONG: Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July nineteen-sixty-nine, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\nPERI: So now we know the truth. The moon landing was faked!\nDOCTOR: Faked? Not at all. Neil Armstrong really did walk on the moon.\nPERI: Yes, but he wasn’t the first. We know there’d been dozens of people there before him, enough to build a whole moonbase!\nDOCTOR: Ah. But the world doesn’t know that.\nPERI: So this is really just a big publicity stunt? For the benefit of the rest of mankind?\nDOCTOR: Not just mankind. No. It’s a message to the rest of the universe. After all, you never know who might be listening...\nDOCTOR: END OF PART FOUR"
