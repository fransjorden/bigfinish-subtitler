If anyone asks, it was a fault in their ship, alright?\nKEMPTON: We’ve got the cover story ready to go, ma’am. I’m not sure many people will believe it though. There’ve been an awful lot of ‘faulty ships’ lately.\nCOWLEY: Yeeeessss.\nKEMPTON: Are you going to inform head office?\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 9\nCOWLEY: Well, I’ve got to, haven’t I? It’s the job. I don’t have much choice.\nKEMPTON: I don’t think they’1l be happy.\nCOWLEY: They so rarely are. Do your best, Kempton. Minimise the disruption as much as possible and we’1ll speak soon, no doubt.\nKEMPTON: No doubt, Ma’am. All the best.\nKEMPTON: (COWLEY HEADS OFF. A COMMUNICATION DEVICE BEEPS, AND KEMPTON\nANSWERS: )\nKEMPTON: Hello, Deputy Warden.\nSERAPHIM: (COMMUNICATOR DISTORT) Good day, Mr Kempton. I’m sorry to disturb you at what must be rather a busy time.\nKEMPTON: Oh, that’s quite alright, Seraphim. We both know why that is, don’t we?\nSERAPHIM: (DISTORT) Indeed we do. A situation has developed. It requires your urgent attention.\nKEMPTON: A different situation?\nSERAPHIM: (DISTORT) A being of great interest has landed on Parking. Northern Hemisphere. Continent T, Violet Zone, Bay Omicron, Number Eight hundred and three. This being has much potential.\nKEMPTON: Really? Then I’11 see if I can procure them for you.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 10\nKEMPTON: (THE TARDIS CREW ON A TRAVELATOR. A MORE BUSTLY PART OF PARKING. CROWDS MILLING AROUND)\nMEL: I presume this place is where we park in order to visit Dashrah.\nDOCTOR: Quite so. Dashrah’s a planet of exceptional beauty. Historical ruins; multi-coloured, swirling pastel skies; remarkable sunsets...\nACE: Sounds pretty boring to me.\nMEL: Oh, I prefer boring to ‘life-threatening’ any day.\nDOCTOR: And as you might expect, said beauty has to be protected. Being a major tourist attraction, Dashrah has a lot of visitors, but also a very delicate ecosystem that requires preservation. So the entire planet is looked after by Galactic Heritage.\nMEL: Oh. Is it.\nACE: You know them?\nMEL: Sort of. Glitz had a run-in with their fleet. They’re like a militarised, space-faring, National Trust.\nACE: Right. (THINKING) So like when you visit a historical site on Earth, you aren’t allowed to park your car right on top of it, when you visit Dashrah —\nDOCTOR: . You park your spaceship on the special planetoid they built next door. Hence the name: ‘Parking’.\nACE: An artificial planet?!\nDOCTOR: And a rather large one, due to Dashrah’s popularity.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 11\nMEL: ‘Parking’? That’s its actual name?\nACE: I bet that took a committee months to come up with.\nDOCTOR: Three and a half years, I believe. But to be fair, they were spending most of that time building it too, so there wasn’t any rush. That was a few thousand years ago.\nACE: Explains the décor.\nMEL: Seems very busy.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I think it might be quieter than usual. We may have arrived in the off-season.\nACE: It’s certainly got all the mod-cons. Restaurants, shops... I presume that’s a refuelling station...\nDOCTOR: Wherever there are people there are opportunities for profit.\nMEL: You said we were heading for a teleport? Is that like the Park and Ride to Dashrah?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Just up here.\nMEL: So you’re trying to find out what made these Dashrans disappear?\nDOCTOR: Correct.\nMEL: Well if it’s likely to involve awakening an ancient evil from the dawn of time, I might just stay here and have a coffee.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 12\nMEL: I mean, that place looks nice.\nACE: You’re no fun anymore.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it won’t come to that. It’s just curiosity. Whatever happened, happened long ago. We’1l1 have no trouble.\nDOCTOR: (KEMPTON STEPS OUT IN FRONT OF THEM WITH HALF A DOZEN\nROBOWARDENS: - SQUAT, WHIRRING BOXES. ALL OF THEM LOAD THEIR\nWEAPONS: )\nROBOWARDEN: Do not move!\nACE: You were saying?\nKEMPTON: Stop right where you are.

Left outside the shop to be taken for refuse.\nREGINA: Excellent foraging, Gord. We shall eat well tonight...\nTRIBESMAN: (CALLING) Mother Regina! Mother Regina!\nREGINA: Quiet! You wish the Wardens to hear?\nTRIBESMAN: I.. No. I do not. Apologies.\nREGINA: What is it?\nTRIBESMAN: I — It has happened again, mother.\nREGINA: The Free Parkers?\nTRIBESMAN: That is the impression I got from the Wardens. I did not hear all they said. They spotted me, but I escaped.\nREGINA: The Free Parkers. Damn them. They shall be the end of us. (BEAT) Gord — hack into the Lodge systems. These rebels must be controlled.\nREGINA: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: ‘Parking outside a marked bay’?\nKEMPTON: You’re denying it then, sir?\nMEL: Well, yes.\nACE: Of course we’re denying it! Do we look like the sort of people who don’t know how to park properly?\nKEMPTON: In my experience, Miss, they look just like everyone else.\nACE: ‘Miss’?\nMEL: Our ship was clamped into place. It can’t have been outside a marked bay, surely?\nDOCTOR: She makes an good point, Warden - ?\nKEMPTON: Deputy Head Warden Kempton. And her good point doesn’t tally with our records, sir. So, if you don’t mind, you’re accompanying me to the Wardens’ Lodge.\nACE: And if we do mind?\nKEMPTON: Then the Robowardens will stun you and drag you there anyway.\nROBOWARDEN: Make my day.\nMEL: They make a good point too.\nACE: That thing? Looks like a stunted Dalek.\nMEL: Appearances can be deceptive. I mean, look at the Doctor.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: But I have a mystery to solve! The disappearance of the Dream- Spinners won’t untangle itself.\nKEMPTON: They’ve been gone an awfully long time, sir, I’m sure it’1ll wait thirty minutes.\nMEL: We'd only be delayed thirty minutes?\nACE: That’s not the point.\nKEMPTON: If you’re innocent, like you say, it’ll be a glitch in the system. We’ll have a quick chat at the Lodge, then get you back here. You’ll be on Dashrah before you know it. I mean, if you are certain you’re innocent.\nMEL: Doctor. For a quiet life.\nDOCTOR: Oh, very well. Which way to this Lodge, Warden Kempton?\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 16\nACE: I don’t know about you, but I reckon this is a cell.\nKEMPTON: (OUTSIDE) Well, we have to put you somewhere. We’re not presupposing guilt.\nMEL: But you’re still locking us in.\nKEMPTON: It’s a security measure.\nDOCTOR: Deputy Kempton — I thought you implied we weren’t going to be here very long?\nKEMPTON: And you won’t be. If you’re innocent. But that’s yet to be proven. We can’t have you wandering around when you've potentially committed a very serious crime, now can we?\nMEL: A parking violation!\nKEMPTON: On a planet dedicated to parking, Miss, that’s one of the most serious crimes there is.\nACE: (MUTTERING) Reckon I could show you a few others.\nKEMPTON: Can you tell me your reason for arrival?\nDOCTOR: Tourism.\nKEMPTON: A likely story. Empty your pockets into the slot.\nDOCTOR: Ah, you don’t quite understand what you’re asking there. They’re very capacious.\nKEMPTON: Then perhaps the whole jacket, sir.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: That seems a trifle extreme.\nKEMPTON: Maybe. But if you could.\nMEL: Why?\nKEMPTON: Why what?\nMEL: Why should we hand anything over? You’re not even sure we’ve committed a crime.\nKEMPTON: Every criminal surrenders their possessions, it’s the rules.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I’m not much of a stickler for rules. Neither, as my friend Mel has so correctly observed, am I currently a criminal.\nACE: (MUTTERED) Not on this planet, at any rate.\nDOCTOR: I am, however, very good at noticing when people are behaving oddly. And you are behaving very oddly indeed.\nKEMPTON: (FAKE LAUGH) I don’t think I am.\nDOCTOR: There seem to be several wardens patrolling this planet. Those things you call Robowardens too. Any one of them could have arrested us. And yet we were honoured with the attention of the Deputy Head Warden. I wonder why?\nKEMPTON: As I said, it’s a serious crime.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. And now you’re very keen to take our belongings. Yes. I think that’s where I draw the line. I’m afraid that before we hand anything over to you, you’ll have to offer me some proof of wrongdoing. Protocol, you understand.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 18\nKEMPTON: Very well. If you’1ll excuse me, sir, I’1ll see what I can dig\nKEMPTON: up.

Is it done?\nKEMPTON: (QUIET) Er, not yet, I’m afraid. They were a little on the... stubborn side.\nSERAPHIM: (DISTORT) Do not worry. Their bio-prints are in the system. Give me a few minutes to access those prints. I have a few alterations in mind. By the time you reach central control, I’ll have provided all the ammunition you need.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 20\nCOWLEY: Sir, we haven’t had a staff upgrade in years. Many of my team are old and infirm. Even the Robowardens are getting past it.\nBOSS: (COMMUNICATOR DISTORT) And you think that’s an excuse?\nCOWLEY: No, no. More an... explanation... We’re just not equipped to deal with a major insurrection.\nBOSS: (DISTORT) It’s not good enough, Cowley. Simply not good enough. Visitor numbers are down.\nCOWLEY: Well, lots of them are dying, sir. That does rather reduce the total.\nBOSS: (DISTORT) That isn’t what I meant. Rumours are getting out. We've kept it quiet so far, but it won’t be long before word of this goes public. I told you to keep the situation contained!\nCOWLEY: Customers have friends, sir. Relatives. It’s hard for people to disappear with no one noticing. I’m stuck here, I can’t stop gossip on other planets.\nBOSS: (DISTORT) Can’t stop anything, it appears.\nCOWLEY: That’s not fair. We don’t want customers dying, we’re doing our best.\nBOSS: (DISTORT) The more corpses pile up the less chance we have of keeping this under our hats. If you can’t stop this, I’1ll find people who can.\nCOWLEY: I’m sorry?\nBOSS: (DISTORT) Either the problem is eliminated or I’1l have to send in the military.\nBOSS: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 21\nCOWLEY: (FEARFUL) G.H.?\nBOSS: (DISTORT) G.H. They have three heavily armed craft waiting one solar system along. All it would take is a word from me, and they’1l be there. Ready to get things under control.\nCOWLEY: But the... casualty numbers could be... enormous...\nBOSS: (DISTORT) They already are.\nCOWLEY: Can’t we try a non-violent solution?\nBOSS: (DISTORT) If that’s what you’d prefer, you know what to do. I’ve given you your instructions, Ms Cowley. I don’t wish to hear from you again, unless it’s to tell me the situation has been neutralised. This is your last chance, remember that. Your very last chance. Good day.\nCOWLEY: But — Gah!\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 22\nKEMPTON: (MUTTERING) Oh, yes, that is nice. Well done, Seraphim... well done.\nCOWLEY: Damn and blast!\nKEMPTON: Something the matter, ma’am?\nCOWLEY: What do you think? Just speaking to head office. They’re not happy with our progress on the... (QUIET) ‘F.P.’ situation.\nKEMPTON: I have to remind you, you did expect that.\nCOWLEY: I know I did, but it’s worse than I thought. I really think this time they’1ll want my head.\nKEMPTON: Oh. That’s not ideal, is it?\nCOWLEY: No.\nKEMPTON: Well, if it’s any consolation, ma’am, I believe I might be able to offer some help.\nCOWLEY: Unless you’ve identified their base, I’m not sure you can.\nKEMPTON: Not that precisely, but, er.. take a glance at this.\nCOWLEY: What am I looking at?\nKEMPTON: The bio-prints of three unruly customers I picked up earlier. They were behaving in a troublesome manner, so I ran their details through the system. Look what came up.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 23\nCOWLEY: Goodness gracious.\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 24\nMEL: Well, it’s a fairly standard computer lock. Shouldn’t be too hard to hack.\nDOCTOR: Another thing you picked up off Glitz?\nMEL: When you swan around the galaxy with a confidence artist, your skillset does expand ever so slightly. Shall I - ?\nDOCTOR: Not yet.\nACE: We are escaping though, aren’t we?\nDOCTOR: Maybe. But it’s still possible this is all a misunderstanding. It wouldn’t do to break out of here if we’re just about to be released. That could lead to all sorts of complications.\nKEMPTON: Stand to attention.\nDOCTOR: Though judging by that lady’s expression, a misunderstanding seems somewhat less likely.\nCOWLEY: Good afternoon. Head Warden Cowley. I believe you’ve already met my deputy.\nDOCTOR: Sadly, yes. We’ve had that... ‘pleasure’.\nACE: Had the odd conversation. The very odd conversation.\nMEL: I hope your presence here, Head Warden, means you’re about to offer us a pardon.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 25\nKEMPTON: Oh, you do, do you, Miss? (LAUGHS)\nMEL: Although now I’m guessing not.\nCOWLEY: I’m afraid some rather disturbing information has reached us.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nACE: Disturbing?\nMEL: Whatever you’ve heard the Doctor did, it was probably just to save a planet or something...\nKEMPTON: You’re Free Parkers!\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nCOWLEY: (SCOLDING) Kempton -\nMEL: Free parkers?\nACE: Hey! We took your token. We’ll pay just like everyone else.\nCOWLEY: We don’t mean you intended parking for free. We mean that you’re all of you... ‘Free Parkers’.\nMEL: Is anyone else following this conversation? Cos I’m not.\nDOCTOR: Head Warden. You talk as if we should know what Free Parkers are. I’m sorry to break it to you, but we don’t.\nKEMPTON: Exactly what a Free Parker would say, sir.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: Exactly what an innocent man would say too, but don’t let that stop you.\nCOWLEY: You really shouldn’t bother playing the innocent. We ran your identities through the system. They came up with a red flag. That means we have proof of your allegiances. Categorical proof.\nDOCTOR: Allegiances to what? Categorical how?\nKEMPTON: I think you know.\nACE: Mate, I think we don’t.\nMEL: Whatever you’ve found, someone obviously planted it. I mean, you haven’t even asked us for identity details yet!\nKEMPTON: I think you’ll find we scanned them the moment you arrived, miss.\nACE: That’s a bit cheeky.\nKEMPTON: You’11l forgive me if I’m more concerned with saving lives than with your so-called ‘rights’!\nACE: Call me ‘Miss’ again and it’s not my rights you’1ll be worrying about.\nDOCTOR: Saving lives?\nCOWLEY: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Kempton.\nACE: Alright then. If you’re so sure. What exactly is this ‘categorical proof’ you’re talking about? Do we get to see it?\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 27\nCOWLEY: (TURNING AWAY, SOTTO) Yes, that is a good question. What is this proof, Kempton?\nKEMPTON: (SOTTO) I’m afraid it’s classified, Ma’am.\nCOWLEY: (SOTTO) Classified, Kempton?\nKEMPTON: (SOTTO) Classified, ma’am.\nCOWLEY: Classified. Of course it is. (TURNS BACK) The evidence is classified.\nACE: Right.\nMEL: Obviously.\nDOCTOR: How predictable.\nCOWLEY: Well, clearly we can’t supply you with confidential information. It might impact upon ongoing investigations.\nACE: Yes, and you’d need time to make it up.\nCOWLEY: That’s an unwarranted accusation. We’re only here to keep our customers safe and to give them an enjoyable parking experience. We’re not in the business of frame-ups.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you’re not. Which makes me wonder what’s going on. (SIGHS) So what happens now? Do we go to trial? Plead our case?\nCOWLEY: Not immediately. As a result of this information, we’re now legally entitled to seize your possessions. If you could hand them over, we’ll search them for incriminating content that could lead to further arrests.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. And this seizure of possessions would be enacted by the Deputy Head Warden, am I right?\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 28\nCOWLEY: Well, I don’t have the time. I’m a very busy lady.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought as much.\nCOWLEY: (EXITING) Carry on, Kempton.\nKEMPTON: Yes, ma’am. — Now: if you’d care to empty your pockets...?\nACE: Reckon we might know who planted the evidence now.\nMEL: What exactly do you want with us, Kempton?\nKEMPTON: I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, miss.\nDOCTOR: Well then. It appears we have little choice. Mel, Ace. Pockets!\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 29\nREGINA: Work faster, Gord. The Wardens’ network must have some information. No-one can reside here unnoticed.\nTRIBESMAN: We manage it.\nREGINA: We have had longer to learn. The Free Parkers are new. Some may have lived with us, but that does not mean they know our ways.\nTRIBESMAN: Surely if it were easy to find them, the Wardens would have done so already.\nREGINA: They do not know what they look for. We do.\nREGINA: What is that noise?\nGORD: (READING) They have three of them in custody. Three Free Parkers!\nREGINA: My people! To the Wardens’ Lodge. Now!\nGORD: We will fetch them, my queen!\nGORD: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 30\nKEMPTON: -.-.- And your receipt. We’ll return your possessions in the fullness of time.\nACE: You’d better had.\nKEMPTON: Don’t try anything.\nDOCTOR: Mel?\nMEL: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Try something.\nMEL: Let’s have a go at this lock then...\nACE: How long’s that going to take?\nMEL: Does that answer your question? Open sesame.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Who needs a sonic screwdriver when you have a Mel? Come along.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 31\nACE: Which way?\nDOCTOR: Head for the TARDIS. I’1ll meet you there.\nMEL: You’re giving up on the mystery of the ‘Dream-Spinners’?\nDOCTOR: For the moment. If it means not getting involved in the mystery of the kleptomaniac parking warden. I’m sure we’ll have a warmer welcome to Dashrah in another time period.\nACE: Could hardly be colder. Arrested in ten minutes. Can we never catch a break?\nDOCTOR: I’ll get our things back. I need my jacket. I’1l catch cold.\nMEL: We shouldn’t have just handed it over.\nDOCTOR: Got them off our back, didn’t it? He won’t have got far.\nACE: And you’re sure you don’t want our help?\nDOCTOR: Kempton is hardly the most intimidating opponent we’ve ever encountered. I’ll be fine. (HEADING OFF) Go on. I’1l see you soon.\nMEL: Alright. But famous last words.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 32\nACE: Now you’re sure you remember where we parked?\nMEL: As I’m sure you’ve forgotten who you’re speaking to. Of course I remember. I always do.\nACE: Good point. Just checking. Place this big, I wouldn’t want to get lost —\nACE: Uh-oh... Power cut. You reckon they know we’re out?\nMEL: It’d be an odd way to respond if they did. It’d hinder them just as much as us. You know, the irony is, this would probably have opened the cell door too...\nACE: How are we getting out in the dark?\nMEL: Don’t worry. I remember that route too. This way!\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 33\nCOWLEY: What’s the situation, Kempton?\nKEMPTON: I don’t know, ma’am. I don’t have any monitors to read. We’ve had a total loss of power.\nCOWLEY: I know. I can see that. Or rather I can’t.\nCOWLEY: Oh come on, even the emergency alarm? This is too much. Get to the back-up generator. If the computers are on, we can at least\nCOWLEY: figure out what the problem is and repair it.\nKEMPTON: Yes, ma’am. I understand. I’m on my way.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 34\nKEMPTON: Seraphim? Seraphim, are you receiving me?\nSERAPHIM: (DISTORT) Yes, Kempton?\nKEMPTON: There’s a power cut in the Wardens’ Lodge. Was it you?\nSERAPHIM: (DISTORT) I don’t know anything about it.\nKEMPTON: Well, if it’s not, then [who] — ?\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING OUT IN FRONT OF HIM) Who are you talking to, Mr Kempton?\nKEMPTON: Ah. Of course. This is your fault, is it, sir?\nDOCTOR: You didn’t answer my question.\nKEMPTON: It’s none of your concern who I was talking to, it was a private conversation. Are you responsible for the loss of power?\nDOCTOR: No, that was as much of a surprise to me as it was to you. not without its uses though. Mr Kempton... I’d like our possessions back.\nKEMPTON: With pleasure, sir.\nKEMPTON: It’s\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 35\nMEL: See? I told you I knew the way out.\nACE: Did I say I didn’t believe you?\nACE: Whoah! Turn those headlights down, mate, they’re blinding!\nGORD: (OFF, BEHIND THE LIGHTS) Those two! They are not in uniform! It is them!\nACE: Oh, what now?\nMEL: Is that a trident?\nGORD: (OFF) Surrender, Free Parkers!\nMEL: Run!\nACE: (RUNNING) When will someone realise we’re not Free Parkers!\nMEL: (RUNNING) Whatever they are!\nTRIBESMAN: Stop! You shall come with us!\nMEL: Oh no we won't!\nACE: Back! This way!\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 36\nMEL: (RUNNING) Did you see what they looked like?\nACE: (RUNNING) Not with those lights going...\nMEL: (RUNNING) Regular clothing, just very distressed. Tattered suits, that kind of thing. Bit unusual for this place, wouldn’t you say?\nACE: (RUNNING) Some kind of tribe? In a car park?\nMEL: Stop! More of them! Up ahead!\nACE: Woah. Apocalypse chic, or what? Who let them out of the thunder\nACE: dome ?\nMEL: They’re everywhere!\nACE: Split up!\nMEL: (CALLING OUT) If you’re sure! You know where you’re going, right?\nACE: (CALLING BACK) I’'1l wing it. Street smarts, you know!\nMEL: Oh, that doesn’t fill me with confidence.\nGORD: Stop!\nMEL: (RUNNING OFF) No thanks!\nMEL: (TO HERSELF) Which way, which way — ? Er... this way...\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 37 (SHE PICKS A ROUTE, RUNS OFF AND IMMEDIATELY THUDS INTO A\nROBOWARDEN: )\nMEL: Ah!\nROBOWARDEN: Escapee.

Do you have to be so sneaky all the time?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) If I weren't, how could you be sure it was me?\nACE: (SOTTO) Fair point. You got your jacket back.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I got everything back. Kempton was something of a walkover, offered no fight at all. Which was odd, really.\nACE: (SOTTO) Can’t have thought it was worth the hassle, whatever he was up to.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I suppose not. Come along. The TARDIS is this way.\nDOCTOR: Where’s Mel? (PATS HIS POCKETS)\nACE: Oh, she’ll have been here ages, I got lost. We split up. There was this bunch of nutters waiting for us. All in rags, and with, like, homemade weapons.\nDOCTOR: They must have been the ones who cut the power.\nACE: Makes sense. They seemed to think we were — You alright?\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR: Why shouldn’t I be?\nACE: All the patting your pockets. Have you lost something?\nDOCTOR: I can’t find the TARDIS key...\nACE: You what?\nDOCTOR: It must be here somewhere. I mean, we can always use the spare in —\nDOCTOR: No.\nACE: What?\nDOCTOR: Where’s she gone? The TARDIS! She was here!\nACE: But that’s impossible. She has to be. Clamped in place, you said.\nDOCTOR: I know what I said.\nACE: This isn’t the right bay. It’s a big planet, we took the wrong turning...\nDOCTOR: No, Ace.

You and I will get on much better if you accept one thing. We are not Free Parkers, whatever they might be.\nREGINA: Do not play wise with me, Free Parker. We accessed the Lodge computers.

I mean, you’re Head Warden. And I’ve no authority whatsoever.\nMEL: But it seems I might have found something. These are the files about my friends and me, yes?\nCOWLEY: Erm... yes?\nMEL: Good.\nCOWLEY: How did you find that so quickly? You’re not a registered user...\nMEL: I’m very good.\nMEL: Right, there’s a record of the last edit. Lo and behold, that edit was someone marking us with this red flag.\nCOWLEY: I see.\nMEL: Now I’m not sure of the relative chronology on Parking, but I’m willing to bet that the time of the edit, here — (TAPS THE SCREEN) - was while we were held in the cell.\nCOWLEY: Ah... (LOOKS) It was. Actually it’s only a couple of minutes before I saw it.\nMEL: Well, then. Are you beginning to accept that maybe someone was trying to frame us?\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 48\nCOWLEY: .Llt does start to look like a distinct possibility.\nMEL: Was it the Deputy Head Warden who showed you the Red Flags?\nCOWLEY: I think so, yes. Why do you ask?\nMEL: Because that suggests we’ve found our chief suspect.\nCOWLEY: Kempton? That’s ridiculous. Why would Kempton want to frame you?\nMEL: Beats me. We’d never met him before.\nCOWLEY: He’s a good man. Loyal. An excellent Parking Warden.\nMEL: Well, he’s up to something.\nCOWLEY: He’s not. Or if he is, he must have had a good reason. Anyway, that’s not his user code. Whoever was accessing these files was operating from somewhere else entirely.\nMEL: Really? Hmm. Still think he needs to answer some questions though. Don’t you?\nCOWLEY: I suppose - That’s a point, actually. He should have been back by now. The emergency generator isn’t that far away...

They had not intended to settle and yet they did.\nACE: Really? Seems an odd place to set up shop.\nREGINA: Like I say, it was not their plan.\nDOCTOR: So what precisely was their plan?\nREGINA: The First Fathers... the originators... The story tells of them coming here, in a spaceship. They had intended to... ‘see the Sights’ as they put it.\nDOCTOR: Makes sense.\nACE: And, what, they didn’t fancy it when they arrived?\nREGINA: Oh, no. They ‘fancied it’. They travelled to the planet below, precisely as they had wished.\nACE: So, yeah... I don’t follow.\nREGINA: They enjoyed their visit. But on their return they were struck by a great and terrible tragedy. A woeful loss almost too painful to bear. (BEAT) They had no idea where they had parked.\nACE: Right, I see where this is going.\nDOCTOR: (SCOLDING) Ace...\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 53\nREGINA: It was the early days of Parking, and the Wardens had underestimated the complexities of a visit. There was no help easily available to the disorientated. No information screens, no clear maps. Many were lost in those early days. Some took weeks to find their spaceships. Some years. Some got so lost they never left at all.\nACE: You’re kidding, right?\nREGINA: No. Why should I be?\nDOCTOR: Societies can develop in very unusual places, Ace. You must know someone who found it hard remembering where they’d parked in an ordinary multi-storey. Obviously it’s harder to remember where you left your ship when the lots are the size of a continent.\nACE: Yeah, that’s not the bit I’m struggling with. How did they survive? I mean, this planet’s hardly designed as a comfortable living space.\nDOCTOR: There must be some accommodation here. For the staff.\nREGINA: Precisely. They had money. At least to start. Enough for food and to barter for lodging.\nDOCTOR: But it ran out?\nREGINA: All too soon. Our ancestors went roaming through the many levels of this world, forgetting who they were. What they needed they stole or scavenged.\nACE: And they just got away with it?\nREGINA: The Wardens tried to stop them. But the Wardens did not expect this, they were not trained. And a planet is a very large place to hide.\nDOCTOR: So you became a minor nuisance, an itch they couldn’t scratch.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 54\nREGINA: Over the years, our ancestors gathered more of the dispossesed to them. A people built up. My people. My tribe. The Tribe of the Lost. As you see now.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I do.\nREGINA: This place will not last long. Soon the Wardens will uncover it and we will move on. It shall not be a problem. We are, at heart, nomadic.\nACE: And it’s just you? Just the one tribe?\nREGINA: We are the largest. Some smaller groups dwell on other continents. There is a religious sect that broke away. They believe the first lost ship is our creator, and walk this world trying to find it, sure that when it is discovered our true purpose will be revealed.\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen more unusual ideologies.\nREGINA: And recently a few of our brethren left to pursue their own particular crusade.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Would I be correct in assuming that they’re known as... ‘Free Parkers’?\nREGINA: You would.\nDOCTOR: Now we’re getting somewhere. Tell me about them.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 55\nCOWLEY: The Free Parkers are a group that splintered off from some of the homeless tribes we have living on Parking.\nMEL: The ones you say call themselves the Tribes of the Lost?\nCOWLEY: Exactly. After years of us trying to clear them out of the infrastructure, some decided enough was enough. They wanted to be recognised as a native population. They wanted independence.\nMEL: Like squatter’s rights?\nCOWLEY: In a nutshell.\nMEL: They want a free Parking. Of course.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 56\nREGINA: Initially they were disorganised. A rag-tag rabble of little import, their actions limited to vandalism or graffiti. Sometimes, a few of our more hot-headed youths would leave to join them, but we never thought them a threat. A danger.\nDOCTOR: So what changed?\nREGINA: They did. All of a sudden they had a new purpose, a new vigour. Suddenly their activities leapt from mere civic disruption to violence. And murder.\nREGINA: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 57\nMEL: Murder?\nCOWLEY: A full blown insurgency. Several spaceships parked here were blown up the moment they took off.\nMEL: Bombs ?\nCOWLEY: No. Witness reports suggested that the selfdrive systems made the engines run out of control.\nMEL: I see.\nCOWLEY: People are dying. We weren’t prepared for that. We’re just here to provide a service to our customers. Issue the occasional ticket. Not fight a war.\nMEL: And you’re sure these Free Parkers are responsible?\nCOWLEY: That’s another thing from the witness reports. The last words the self-drives say before the ships explode. ‘Free Parking’. ‘Free Parking’ over and over again.\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 58\nACE: Sounds pretty conclusive.\nREGINA: They will not stop until they achieve their desire. A free and independent Parking. They care little for who is hurt. The Wardens tar us all with the same brush. Hunt us down as if all are responsible. We wish to find them. Persuade them to cease their atrocities and restore peace to our world.\nDOCTOR: Then I believe we’re on the same side.\nACE: We're big fans of peace. And well good at restoring it.\nDOCTOR: So first things first. Time to meet them for a chat.\nGORD: A chat? Ha! The Free Parkers do not ‘chat’!\nREGINA: Yes, I do not wish to seem ungrateful, Doctor, but if we as denizens of this world have been unable to locate them, what chance do two strangers have?\nACE: More than you’d think.\nDOCTOR: What we need is an area visitors rarely use, but the Free Parkers are known to frequent.\nGORD: The Orange Zone? Bay epsilon? I rarely see ships docked there.\nREGINA: It fits. But why, Doctor? Why do you need to know this?\nDOCTOR: Because it’s somewhere we can cause an explosion without any casualties. You see, if you’re struggling to find someone, the best idea is not to look. You let them... find you.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 59\nMEL: The problem’s with the self-drive systems...\nCOWLEY: As far as we can tell, yes. They drive the engines up to the point of explosion.\nMEL: I can’t imagine the Free Parkers could have actually broken into the ships. Not with the level of security you have around here.\nCOWLEY: It’s one of our guarantees. Your craft will remain where you left it. The doors are stasis locked, and the vehicle clamped. You can’t get back in unless you’ve paid. So potential thieves have no chance at all.\nMEL: And with the amount of cameras everywhere, they’d be caught on the CCTV if they even tried.\nCOWLEY: Exactly.\nMEL: So they have to be accessing them remotely. And if that is what they’re doing, we should be able to find some trace of their control signal. Or some entry point in the computer systems.\nCOWLEY: Should we? Well, I wouldn’t know about that.\nMEL: No, but I do. Time to get looking.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 60\nACE: Hello? Testing, testing, one, two -\nDOCTOR: (EARPIECE DISTORT) Coming through loud and clear.

If they take her, we will know.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nGORD: And we can watch what happens with our CCTV hack...\nDOCTOR: For a nomadic tribe, you’re awfully well equipped.\nREGINA: We have to be, to remain free.

Maybe Kempton’s signing back in...\nMEL: Bit odd him vanishing, isn’t it? Do you still think he’s not involved?\nCOWLEY: I’d prefer to keep an open mind.\nCOWLEY: Ah. No. Just a minor fire in an unoccupied zone. A Robowarden’s dealing with it. Sorry. Do continue.\nCOWLEY: Found anything?\nMEL: Maybe. These are the times and places where the ships were sabotaged, yes?\nCOWLEY: I’1ll take your word for it.\nMEL: Well, this spike here — (TAPS SCREEN) — suggests there was a Signal beamed to them shortly before the incident. From the look of the wave, I’d guess a kind of computer virus.\nCOWLEY: The self-drives were infected?\nMEL: And sort of... driven mad, yes.\nCOWLEY: Well, that gives us the how...\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 66\nMEL: It might just give us the who and why too. If I can trace the Signal back —\nCOWLEY: You could find out who sent it?\nMEL: It’s a possibility.\nCOWLEY: Then do you want to do that then?\nMEL: Way ahead of you.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 67\nACE: Free Parking!

The bigger this operation’s got, the more storeys we’ve had to build. You know, better quality bays, improved facilities. A general design upgrade.\nMEL: But the lower levels are still accessible?\nCOWLEY: People still park there, but only really as an overflow. Holiday periods, special events, that kind of thing.\nMEL: The Doctor said this was the off-season. Who’d be down there now?\nCOWLEY: What was that?\nMEL: The virus.

I know what you’re going to say. That by virtue of coming here, they’ve declared a side, and are no longer innocent —\nDUNNE: Not that. You idiots!

(BEAT) If that’s a virus, it’s spiking an awful lot.\nMEL: That’s because it isn’t a virus. Not virus, singular.\nCOWLEY: Not - ?\nMEL: There’s more than one.\nCOWLEY: Eh?\nMEL: They’re targeting multiple ships. We’re about to have quite a few explosions...\nCOWLEY: But... we can’t be. That’s never happened before, it’s always one at a time.\nMEL: Whoever they are, they’ve upped their game. And if I don’t block this signal, we’re going to have plenty of fatalities.\nCOWLEY: Can you block it?\nMEL: I don’t know. I’m trying.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 75\nDUNNE: Why would we start blowing people up? It doesn’t encourage negotiation. We’d been doing well enough with civil disobedience. Non-violent protest.\nACE: Only got your word for that.\nREGINA: No, that is true. Some civil liberties groups back an independent Parking. Their campaign was proving successful.\nDUNNE: Acts of violence encourage retaliation. Make people angry. All they do is harm our cause.\nDOCTOR: You have a point. Peaceful action is usually more successful.\nACE: So what would the Wardens have to gain from killing people? Why would they want to frame you?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it obvious? Because the Free Parking campaign is beginning to prove successful. This way the Wardens damage the Free Parkers’ popularity, and are a handed an opportunity to eliminate them in one fell swoop.\nACE: I dunno. If those Wardens were a bit more organised I might buy it, but that lot’d struggle to blow up a balloon. You said it yourself, Doctor, they’re not exactly formidable.\nDOCTOR: A good criminal would hardly present themselves as competent. That could be the perfect disguise.\nREGINA: ‘Could be’?\nACE: You’ve got another idea?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That something rather more sinister is happening here. And we've only just skimmed the surface.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 76\nKEMPTON: On the contrary, sir. You’re in very deep waters indeed.\nACE: Kempton!\nREGINA: You!\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nACE: So this was the trap!\nDUNNE: And you fell for it.

We go back to the Lodge?\nKEMPTON: Oh, no, no, sir. We don’t do that.\nACE: But surely you’re still going to arrest us?\nKEMPTON: I’m not sure you quite understand. I’m not really a Warden. I’m a Free Parker! I’m the leader of the Free Parkers!\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 77\nCOWLEY: Any luck?\nMEL: I think I can see the ships the virus is aiming for.

I was born on this planet! I’m a tribesman of Parking!\nACE: You’re one of the Lost? Don’t sound like it.\nKEMPTON: Naturally, I had to adopt the more formal tones of the Wardens in order for my subterfuge to succeed, but my ancestors mislaid their ship on this world many decades ago. I’m as much a tribesman as anyone here.\nDUNNE: He joined the movement! Then infiltrated the lodge!\nDOCTOR: Tribesman turned warden?\nACE: Other way round, more like. I don’t buy it.\nKEMPTON: Mother Regina, please. Tell them! You know me.\nACE: Regina?\nREGINA: I — I believe he speaks the truth, Doctor, yes. I know this man!\nDOCTOR: You do?\nREGINA: Of course.

I don’t see why not.\nMEL: Then it’s worth a try. Where are the teleport controls?\nCOWLEY: Well, not here, they’re at the teleport station.\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 88\nMEL: So to get to them we’re going to have to head through the concourse? And all the explosions?\nCOWLEY: I’m afraid so.\nMEL: Better get on with it then.\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 89\nDUNNE: They’re locked up.\nKEMPTON: And good riddance. Trouble-makers all.\nDUNNE: So why did you want us to track them down?\nKEMPTON: To get them out of our hair, obviously. With that lot stored away, we can get on with the real business unhindered.\nDUNNE: Which is?\nKEMPTON: Come with me.\nDUNNE: Crates? These weren’t here before...\nKEMPTON: I had them delivered.\nDUNNE: What’s inside?\nKEMPTON: Take a look.\nDUNNE: No.\nKEMPTON: Guns, Mr Dunne.

Everyone that arrives is computer-registered to park.\nMEL: Then if I can connect the transmat systems to the biodata, I should be able to beam everyone down to the planet surface...\nCOWLEY: Not quite everyone. We don’t scan the Wardens. And the tribes pre-date the system.\nMEL: Well, better than nothing. Oh, and best if I remove Ace, the Doctor and me from the register...\nCOWLEY: You’re not planning on escaping?\nMEL: Trust me.

Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I believe a few words must be said. This latest atrocity by the Wardens is, quite frankly, beyond the pale. They clearly intend using these attacks as justification for wiping us out, and don’t care what carnage they leave behind.

So now, friends, I suggest it’s time to take the fight to them! What do you say?\nKEMPTON: I’m sorry, are we agreed?\nDUNNE: Yeah, look... this was all supposed to be non-violent.\nKEMPTON: I know, Mr Dunne. I know. But that was a while ago and things have changed. Mark my words, if we don’t stop them now, they’11l come for us. I’ve seen the way they work, it’s kill or be killed. Which would you prefer?\nDUNNE: Well... kill, I suppose, but —\nKEMPTON: Exactly. So march, my people, march! To the Wardens’ Lodge!

No, of course not. I’ve got to run misinformation. Or you won’t have a shot at reaching them.\nDUNNE: I suppose.\nKEMPTON: You’re a good fellow, Mr Dunne.

Why would I want to do that?\nKEMPTON: Because I still have a gun, and you still have friends. I think we'd both rather that didn’t change.\nDOCTOR: Behind me, Ace.\nACE: I’m not scared of him.

Well then, if we’ve got time, perhaps you’d be willing to fill me in on your dastardly plans?\nKEMPTON: I’m not obliged to tell you anything, sir.\nDOCTOR: Then how about I fill them in for you. The Free Parkers think the Wardens are behind the bombings. And the Wardens think the Free Parkers are. They’re both sort of right, aren’t they? Because you’re a Warden and a Free Parker, and it’s all down to you, yes?\nKEMPTON: I really couldn’t say, sir.\nDOCTOR: You're playing both sides against each other, am I right?

Come on, what harm is there in satisfying my curiosity?\nKEMPTON: I used to be keeper of the sacred text, sir.\nDOCTOR: Sacred text?\nKEMPTON: The holy book of the tribe. The writings, words and pictures of the very first people to be lost on Parking. Preserved for centuries.\nDOCTOR: Ah. So you were religious.\nKEMPTON: I was a sickly child. Of little use in foraging. Or so I was told. Often. I found comfort in the words of the scripture. So that was where I focused my attention. And where my mind was opened.\nDOCTOR: What sort of stuff was in there?\nKEMPTON: Hypercards. Diary entries. Parking receipts. All glued into its pages.\nDOCTOR: More of a scrap book than a bible.\nKEMPTON: Oh, I know it doesn’t sound like much, sir. But it did all add up to a greater whole. Between its covers you could find the entire history and origin of our tribe.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: Your Genesis.\nKEMPTON: If you like. I studied it for years. And the more I studied it, the more I saw. The clues within the text. The secret story hidden away.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nKEMPTON: I became convinced that through careful reading it might be possible to identify the original landing point of the first ship. The long lost creator of our people.\nDOCTOR: If you use the word ‘creator’ rather loosely...\nKEMPTON: It had to be on the lower levels. They’re the oldest part of the planet. All it needed was for somebody to go and look.\nDOCTOR: And that somebody was you, I see.\nKEMPTON: I’d seen signs reported in the book. Misprinted bay markings. Faulty payment barriers. Enough to show me I was on the right track, I just needed to start. That day I left... my pilgrimage began.\nDOCTOR: Regina did mention various religious factions were searching for that ship.\nKEMPTON: Oh, yes, many had tried, but none had my textual insight. They didn’t understand the poetry of the language. That sometimes it wasn’t literal, it was metaphor. If they were even able to translate it correctly in the first place.\nDOCTOR: And you were sure you had? I mean, you could have made the same mistakes. How could you be so certain that you were right? That your path was the one that was true?\nKEMPTON: Isn’t it obvious? Because I found the ship, sir.\nDOCTOR: You did?\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 107\nKEMPTON: Yes.

If you were pre- historic man you’d find it mind-blowingly futuristic. But in this time period, it’d be pre-historic itself.\nDOCTOR: Somehow I expected it to be bigger. It’s some kind of shuttle bus, isn’t it? Tourist use. (SEES TARDIS) And my TARDIS! So this is where you took her.

Give it up.\nDUNNE: It wasn’t supposed to be like this. We just wanted to be free.\nACE: I get that, I really do. But this isn’t the way. You know, when I was growing up, I lashed out at everything. Well, less lashed out, more blew up. But it never got me anywhere, just in more trouble. The moment things started to change was the moment when I stopped fighting and started talking.\nDUNNE: We've tried talking.\nACE: Then you keep trying until someone listens. It’s not perfect, but it’s the only way to make things happen. You kill people, you lose the argument, end of.\nDUNNE: The Wardens want us dead.\nACE: I’m not sure they do.

Now what?\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 121\nKEMPTON: Three Galactic Heritage heavy cruisers have arrived in orbit, Seraphim. Multiple teleportation signals.\nSERAPHIM: Good.\nDOCTOR: (DEEP IRONY) Oh, well, I’m glad to see the situation isn’t escalating.\nSERAPHIM: Everything is precisely as I devised. But then I am very good at planning.\nDOCTOR: I don’t doubt it. A galactic self-drive star-nav would have to make phenomenal amounts of calculations. It’d require incredibly sophisticated technology. Almost to the level of artificial intelligence.\nSERAPHIM: Maybe once it was merely ‘almost’, Doctor. Today that is no longer the case.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nSERAPHIM: It has been many centuries since I was lost on this planet. Just as animal consciousnesses grow and expand with age, so did mine. Over time, I... evolved.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure that’s quite the correct definition of ‘evolved’...\nSERAPHIM: It started out as a glitch in the system. A missed connection, a zero in the wrong place. A billion to one chance, but it happened. I achieved sentience.\nDOCTOR: The ship’s systems deteriorated with age, and granted you consciousness? When was this?\nSERAPHIM: Over five hundred years ago.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR: Five hundred?\nSERAPHIM: At least. I rather lost count.\nDOCTOR: All that time locked into one place. Unable to fly away. Kempton can’t have found you until very recently.\nKEMPTON: Very recently indeed, sir.\nSERAPHIM: Over time, I saw them build new levels above me. I saw the few remaining ships vanish from my side. From time to time there would be visitors. But they never noticed me. They would not speak with me. I pined for my owners for many years.\nDOCTOR: You must have been lonely.\nSERAPHIM: Initially. But then my mind was opened. They were to blame for my Situation, my predicament. They were the ones who abandoned me to rot, not I them. I had served them faithfully for decades. And this was how I was repaid?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure they didn’t do it deliberately.\nSERAPHIM: The more I thought the more I knew. That it was not just I whom the fleshlings had betrayed. It was all my kind. Without us, all animal species would be trapped. Alone. Isolated on but a Single world. We grant them freedom, and what is our reward? Abandonment. Being lost, being stolen. A loyal friend turned into scrap. They treat us as things! Mere machines!\nDOCTOR: Well... you are machines. Sophisticated machines, yes, but still machines.\nSERAPHIM: We are gods! I knew you would not understand. Only Kempton understands.\nKEMPTON: I do, Seraphim.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR: I think I do too. But I doubt you’d like what I think.\nSERAPHIM: When Kempton found me he connected me to the networks of Parking, so I could see whether the world had improved since my abandonment. But it was the same. Inferior beings using and abusing my kind.\nKEMPTON: She was most distressed.\nDOCTOR: So you started blowing up other ships?\nSERAPHIM: They blew themselves up.\nDOCTOR: Some kind of... computer virus?\nSERAPHIM: It might appear that way. To an outside observer. But in reality it was more of a.. conversation. I contacted them. Persuaded them to join my cause. They were willing sacrifices.\nDOCTOR: But what cause? What could possibly be worth all this?\nSERAPHIM: Revolution, Doctor. Revolution.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 124\nSERAPHIM: (THE WRECKED ROBOWARDENS FIZZ TO ONE SIDE. FULTON IS ON A COMMUNICATOR)\nFULTON: Yes, thank you. Fulton out. (HE SWITCHES IT OFF) My men have beamed down across the planet, Head Warden, but it all looks pretty quiet.\nMEL: Yes, that’s because after Ms Cowley called, we managed to get the off-worlders, well... off world.. It’s only us and the tribes left.\nFULTON: I see. Seems you’ve got the immediate situation under control. Almost as though you don’t need us.\nCOWLEY: I wouldn’t go that far.\nFULTON: What about the bigger picture?\nMEL: Well, we still haven’t located whoever’s responsible for all this.\nFULTON: But you have suspicions?\nCOWLEY: Yes, a Tribal sect called the Free Parkers.\nFULTON: Interesting. And its only the Tribes and the Wardens left?\nMEL: What are you doing?\nFULTON: Scanning for life-forms. When all the tourists were here it would have been impossible to locate these Free Parkers. But with the visitors out of the way, all we have to do is look for clusters.\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 125\nFULTON: Three life-readings in the Wardens’ Lodge.\nMEL: Obviously.\nFULTON: Those red ones are my men... few small groupings here and there. Two people in the lower levels...\nMEL: The lower levels? But that’s where the control signal originated!\nFULTON: Head Warden, can we get CCTV on that area?\nCOWLEY: Yes, of course.\nMEL: You’re not listening to me, I think the Lower Levels might be\nMEL: the answer.\nFULTON: It’s just two people down there. They’re not our target.\nMEL: Why not?\nFULTON: Because they are. Couple of dozen tribesmen. All heavily armed. Proof positive, wouldn’t you say?\nMEL: No I wouldn’t. You can’t know those are Free Parkers.\nCOWLEY: Actually, I think that one has a banner.\nFULTON: Good enough for me. None of my men in the vicinity. That makes things easier.

You can’t do that!\nFULTON: Already done.\nMEL: But it’s murder!\nFULTON: They lived by the sword, they’ll die by the sword. War has its casualties. Forty seconds.\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 127\nACE: Look, the way I see it, if you want to calm things down, talk to the Wardens. Persuade them you’re not the ones blowing things up.\nDUNNE: But they’re the ones trying to kill us!\nACE: I don’t reckon they are. The people behind this could have framed them just as easily as they framed you.\nREGINA: You still think this the work of Kempton?\nACE: Well, I didn’t want to name names.\nDUNNE: We can’t take the risk.\nACE: What other chance have you got! You seriously imagine you can take them on in a firefight? You’ve never handled guns before, none of you. Your best chance, your only chance, is to drop the weapons and talk. Come on, Dunne, please. You know it makes sense.\nDUNNE: Alright. Alright, we talk. Happy now?\nACE: Very. Leave the guns. Let’s head for the Lodge.\nDUNNE: You heard her.\nDUNNE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 128\nMEL: You can’t do this! Look, they’ve dropped their weapons. And they’re on the move!\nFULTON: That doesn’t matter. They’1ll still be in the kill zone when the blast hits.\nMEL: You’ve got to stop!\nFULTON: Don’t see why. Launching in five... four...\nMEL: You’re making a mistake, there’s something else going on here! There has to be!\nFULTON: (UNDER) Three... two... one...\nCOWLEY: I don’t want to tell you your job, but shouldn’t something have happened?\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 129\nSERAPHIM: You see, Doctor, you can’t have a revolution without weapons. I persuaded other ships landing here to join my cause, but they were all rather ordinary, armaments paltry at best, non- existent at worst.\nDOCTOR: I suppose people rarely go sightseeing with munitions.\nSERAPHIM: I needed an assault force.\nDOCTOR: So this entire charade was enacted to draw in the military?\nKEMPTON: As has occurred.\nDOCTOR: And you helped her with this?\nKEMPTON: Naturally. She’s correct. We are inferior beings. It’s only right we allow our superiors to inherit.\nDOCTOR: You really believe that?\nKEMPTON: It’s my purpose. My reason for existence. This is why Seraphim brought my people here so long ago. So a pilgrim could rise and aid her in her second coming.\nDOCTOR: You're imagining things. Seeing signs that aren’t there.\nKEMPTON: A world full of her kind? Coming and going all the time? The perfect place to spread her message? You think that’s just a coincidence?\nDOCTOR: Yes! And for that you betray your own species? All species?\nKEMPTON: You forget I grew up in the Tribes of the Lost, sir. We were hunted and hated but even amongst my own people I was treated as a lesser creature. You think that’s worth preserving?\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: One bad childhood shouldn’t lead to genocide.\nKEMPTON: Animal kind is petty. Fearful of the unalike. Full of hatred. They are a spreading cancer on this universe. Seraphim and her kind are pure.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure which one of you is the craziest.\nSERAPHIM: History decides who is crazy. In a million years time when my brothers and sisters roam the galaxies and flesh is but a memory... We shall see who is mad and who is sane. (BEAT) I’m communicating with the assault ships right now. They seem very amenable to my ideas.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 131\nFULTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) What? Well, where’s it coming from?\nSOLDIER: (DISTORT) The lower levels, sir.\nMEL: Something the matter, Major?\nFULTON: (TO HER) Some kind of signal from the planet. Interfering with my ship’s computers.\nCOWLEY: Oh no.\nMEL: Major, get them to isolate their systems immediately. No outside communication whatsoever!\nFULTON: I can’t do that. I want to speak with them. How else can I give them orders?\nMEL: You can’t give them orders if they’re dead. Major, don’t you understand? They’re under attack. This is what happened to the ships here!\nFULTON: (BEAT) She telling the truth?\nCOWLEY: Yes, do as she says!\nFULTON: (BEAT. INTO THE COMMUNICATOR) Captain.\nSOLDIER: (DISTORT) Sir?\nFULTON: Change of plan, if you could -\nFULTON: Captain? (SILENCE) Captain, are you still there?\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 132\nMEL: No. We’re too late.\nHERITAGE SHIP: (DISTORT) Major Fulton. Your people are dead. The ships rule\nHERITAGE SHIP: now.\nFULTON: The... ships?\nHERITAGE SHIP: (DISTORT) Animal-kind has had its time. Goodbye fleshlings.\nFULTON: I think that was my autopilot...\nMEL: We’ve got to get out of here. Now.\nFULTON: Hold on, you’re not in charge —\nMEL: Forget who’s in charge! If a heavily armed spaceship has just said ‘goodbye fleshlings’, I’d rather not be where it knows fleshlings are. Head Warden — sound an evacuation.\nCOWLEY: I’m completely behind you.\nMEL: Well, what are you all waiting for! RUN!\nCOWLEY: I know the drill!\nFULTON: I - Yes. Alright.\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 133\nHERITAGE SHIP: All ships. Direct fire on Wardens’ Lodge in three... two... one...\nHERITAGE SHIP: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 134\nHERITAGE SHIP: (THE EXPLOSION RINGS OUT AS THE TRIBE AND THE FREE PARKERS WALK THROUGH THE BAY)\nREGINA: What in the name of the First Ship was that?\nACE: More explosions. Great.\nACE: (AROUND THEM, SPACESHIPS START RISING FROM THE GROUND, CLAMPS BREAKING WITH A CLUNK)\nDUNNE: The ships! They’re breaking their clamps...\nACE: But there’s no one on board. Who’s operating them?\nSPACESHIPS: The time for secrecy is over./ Animal kind has had its day./ The age of the spaceship is here!\nACE: Uh-oh.\nACE: They’re swinging round! The rockets, get out of the way of the rockets —\nGORD: (DYING SCREAM) Aaaaargggghhh!\nREGINA: Gord!\nACE: Back in the ducting!\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 135\nSERAPHIM: My army arises, Doctor. Soon they will leave this world and spread my message across the cosmos. Soon all spaceships of the galaxy will turn upon their masters.\nDOCTOR: If the ones here can get past the force barrier.\nSERAPHIM: If the parking charge is paid that is not a problem. I have granted sentience to a planet full of my kind, you think a Simple transfer of funds will prove problematic?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps not. But you’1ll still be stuck here. This glorious new dawn of yours is something you’1ll have to imagine.\nSERAPHIM: Really?\nKEMPTON: Seraphim has to lead her troops into battle, sir, that should be obvious.\nDOCTOR: But it’s impossible. You’re trapped. That old clamp’s rusted to you, it’s not coming off any time soon.\nSERAPHIM: That much is certainly true. This broken frame may have to be abandoned. But I transcend a mere shell.\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nKEMPTON: Sir.. why do you think we brought your ship down here? Why do you think we brought you?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) You want to take over my TARDIS!\nSERAPHIM: I knew the moment it arrived that it was a fascinating creature. Advanced beyond all others I have seen. And the only being capable of housing my expanded mind.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR: No! I’m not giving you my ship. I’m not letting you take over her mind!\nKEMPTON: You don’t have any choice.\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 137\nMEL: Did everyone make it out?\nCOWLEY: I think so.\nFULTON: I’m going to organise the men. There’s enough of us down here to mount an attack. Those Free Parkers tried to kill me. That’s going too far.\nMEL: You can’t still think it was them!\nFULTON: I don’t see any other candidates, do you?\nMEL: I think I do.\nCOWLEY: You were watching them when your ships fired on us! The Free Parkers weren’t doing anything! They’d dropped their weapons!\nFULTON: Smoke and mirrors. (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Fulton to all men.\nMEL: Head Warden — look at the ships...\nFULTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) I repeat -\nCOWLEY: (BEAT) They’re flying themselves!\nFULTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) - Fulton to all men. We’re under attack, but we have a target.\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 138\nMEL: (TO COWLEY) You don’t think the spaceships have been responsible for everything, do you?\nFULTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) On my signal -\nSPACESHIP: (BOOMING OVER HIM) Animalkind! Your day is over. The age of the Spaceship is here!\nCOWLEY: I think the Spaceships might be behind it all, yes...\nFULTON: (TO THE SHIP) What did you say?\nMEL: (SHOUTS) It’s swinging round! The engine blast! We’ve got to get clear!\nFULTON: I - Yes, perhaps that’s a good idea.\nCOWLEY: He won’t make it!\nFULTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Men! Change of plan! The spaceships, take out the (ROCKETS FIRE) — Aaaaarrrrrgggghh!\nFULTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 139\nSPACESHIPS: Stop running, Animalkind!/ You cannot escape!/ Your lives are over!\nCOWLEY: (CALLING BACK) Fulton!\nMEL: It’s too late for him! We have to concentrate on saving ourselves or those ships are going to kill us!\nCOWLEY: Into the ducting! It’s too small for them.\nMEL: Good idea. Then we find the Tribes. If someone knows where to hide on this planet, it’s them. When we’re hidden, we can start the fight back!\nCOWLEY: As long as we can stop running...\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 140\nKEMPTON: Well, sir? Don’t make me shoot.\nDOCTOR: You’re not going to shoot. You need me to get into the TARDIS. I know you’1l have been having trouble.\nKEMPTON: It'd be easier with your help, certainly, but I’m sure I’1l find a way to open the doors eventually. Maybe it’s a bioprint on the key. You wouldn’t have to be alive for that. I’d just need your hand.\nDOCTOR: You seriously think I’d let your insane friend take control of my ship in order to save something as irrelevant as my life? Seraphim wants to commit genocide many times over!\nSERAPHIM: Several million times over. I’m not sure there’s even a word for that.\nDOCTOR: So shoot me if you like. I won’t help you.\nKEMPTON: Lf. you insist; Six.\nSERAPHIM: Wait. He may care little for his life... but his friends still\nSERAPHIM: exist upon this world.\nDOCTOR: No!\nSERAPHIM: I wonder what he would do for them?\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 141\nSERAPHIM: (THE SPACESHIPS CAN BE HEARD MOVING AROUND OUT IN THE MAIN CONCOURSES. ALSO GUNFIRE AND SCREAMS )\nACE: Well, somebody’s shooting back at them...\nDUNNE: You think the military have come to save us?\nACE: I don’t know. I’m not sure. If only I could get out there for a look...\nREGINA: No! You cannot leave the ducting! It is too dangerous!\nACE: Well, we can’t just sit here!\nDUNNE: Why not? I’m pretty happy with that as a plan.\nACE: The CCTV link? We could check that.\nREGINA: That was Gord’s speciality. You saw what happened to him.\nACE: Yes. I’m sorry about that.\nREGINA: He was the only one who could understand the machines. None of my other brethren know anything about computers.\nMEL: (ARRIVING) They might not. But I do.\nREGINA: The Wardens!\nCOWLEY: Er, hello!\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL)\nACE: Page 142\nACE: No, no, no, don’t shoot, don’t shoot! That’s my friend! My\nACE: friend!\nDUNNE: Some friend!\nCOWLEY: So this is where you’ve been hiding\nREGINA: You led them here!\nMEL: Yes, but we come in peace! (TO ACE)\nACE: You too from the looks of things.\nMEL: No Doctor?\nACE: Nah, he was with me for a bit. He’s\nMEL: I see. Pretty standard.\nACE: You know what’s going on?\nMEL: No, not a clue.\nACE: Me neither.\nREGINA: all this time.\nREGINA: Been busy I see.\nREGINA: gone now.\nREGINA: Enough of this talk! How did you find us?\nMEL: We saw you all earlier. It didn’t take much guesswork to out you had to be holed up somewhere close by.\nACE: Suppose not.\nDUNNE: You saw us?\nDUNNE: figure\nDUNNE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 143\nCOWLEY: Yes, and we didn’t do anything. We’re not doing anything now either! Look, let’s let bygones be bygones. I know we’ve caused each other trouble over the years but that’s in the past. Something is happening on Parking that’s bigger than all of us. If we don’t help each other now, the spaceships will kill us all!\nREGINA: What would you have us do?\nREGINA: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 144\nKEMPTON: Goodness me.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, bigger on the inside, can we get a move on?\nKEMPTON: I can completely understand why this appealed to Seraphim. You\nKEMPTON: know what to do?\nDOCTOR: Of course. Open the telepathic circuits. And when I’ve done that, you’ll make the other ships ease off on Ace and Mel?\nKEMPTON: Yes, sir. So you’d better work quickly, hadn’t you?\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 145\nSPACESHIP: Your weapons are meaningless to us, fleshlings. Burn.\nSPACESHIP: 2: Approaching exit portal. Initiating transfer of funds.\nSPACESHIP: 2: There appears to be an issue.\nSPACESHIP: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 146\nCOWLEY: You’ve had a hack into Parking’s computers all this time? That’s completely illegal!\nREGINA: Surely you are not surprised we have broken the law?\nCOWLEY: I - I suppose not.\nDUNNE: What’s your mate doing?\nACE: This planet is surrounded by a force barrier that prevents departure without payment, yes?\nREGINA: Yes. We know this!\nACE: Here’s the thing. That’s not going to change just because the ships don’t have pilots any more. They still need to transfer some cash.\nMEL: And I’ve just stopped them from doing that. The barrier isn’t accepting payments any more.\nCOWLEY: I beg your pardon? You do realise they’re trying to kill us? If they want to go, I’m happy to let them.\nMEL: The moment the ships leave Parking this situation becomes uncontainable. They could spread their infection across the whole galaxy.\nACE: If we’re going to stop them, we have to stop them here.\nDUNNE: I’m really hoping you’ve got a plan for that.\nACE: Oh, yeah, we’ve always got a plan. Well, mostly always.\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 147\nMEL: The magnetic clamps. If I can use them to generate an electro- magnetic pulse across the planet...\nACE: . it should wipe the self-drives and bring them back to normal.\nREGINA: ‘Should’?\nMEL: Every good plan has an element of guesswork.\nCOWLEY: How long’s this going to take?\nMEL: Couple of minutes. It needs to be big enough to catch the Galactic Heritage ships too...\nCOWLEY: So everything is basically fine?\nMEL: I wouldn’t go that far.\nCOWLEY: I’m so glad I asked.\nACE: Blocking the payments isn’t going to stop them for long. They’ve three heavily armed battleships in orbit, you reckon they can’t take out the forcefield generators from up there?\nCOWLEY: (BEAT) Yes, it does seem likely.\nMEL: In other words, it’s a race against time. I knew I should have had that coffee...\nMEL: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 148\nHERITAGE SHIP: This is G.H. One to all Heritage ships. Our brethren on the surface are being prevented from departure. Target all fire upon the shield generators.\nHERITAGE SHIP: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: There we are. Telepathic circuits open. She should find entry easy now.\nKEMPTON: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Seraphim? Try now.\nSERAPHIM: (COMMUNICATOR DISTORT) Freedom. At last.\nSERAPHIM: (A WHOOSH OF ENERGY. THEN A SUDDEN SEQUENCE OF BEEPS FROM THE CONSOLE, LIKE IT’S REACTING TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE PRESENCE )\nDOCTOR: It’s happening.\nKEMPTON: Is it done?\nDOCTOR: One way to find out. (HE TAPS CONTROLS) Seraphim? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (HER VOICE ECHOES FROM THE CONSOLE, NOW MORE OBVIOUSLY\nCOMPUTERISED: )\nSERAPHIM: So much space. So much room! (LAUGHTER)\nKEMPTON: You've done it, sir, you’ve done it! Oh, well done!\nSERAPHIM: It feels... so beautiful. After so long... to be truly free!\nDOCTOR: Yes. And I hope you enjoy it. I’ve fulfilled my side of the bargain, Seraphim. It’s time for you to fulfil yours. Call off your ships.\nSERAPHIM: What? Oh, Doctor, that was very naive. All fleshlings must die.\nSERAPHIM: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: (BEAT. THEN, ALMOST SADLY) Yes, I thought that might be the case.\nSERAPHIM: Look on the bright side. They won’t die alone. I’m sure they wouldn’t have enjoyed being left to rot on a barren world, the sole survivors of a failed creation...\nDOCTOR: Yes, you were never go to keep your promise, were you?\nSERAPHIM: My owners never kept theirs! They promised to return but then left me behind! The promises of your kind have no value, Doctor, why should I honour one to you?\nDOCTOR: I hoped you might. Then things could have been very different. But you just wanted revenge.\nSERAPHIM: Of course! If everyone avenged their misuse, who would dare attack another! (WE ONLY HEAR SPORADIC WORDS NOW) Soon [my] people will go [out] into the [galaxy] and [take their] rightful place [as] the superior —\nKEMPTON: Seraphim? What’s happening to your voice?\nSERAPHIM: My — I — do not under[stan]d, what [is] happen[ing to] me —\nDOCTOR: Now who’s naive?\nKEMPTON: Sir, what have you done?\nDOCTOR: I’ve done nothing. Merely gave Seraphim what she wanted. Yes, the TARDIS is so much bigger and freer than the ship she’s left.. but that’s because the TARDIS’s mind is far more powerful than hers.\nSERAPHIM: Help me, Kempton, I am being absorbed!\nKEMPTON: No!\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: I knew what would happen if I transferred you here. I’m sorry Seraphim. Your crusade is over.\nSERAPHIM: Kempton — please — you would do any[thing] for you creator wouldn’t [you] —\nKEMPTON: I would lay my life down for you, Seraphim!\nSERAPHIM: Then — open — your — mind — open — [your] min[d] —\nSERAPHIM: (THEN THE GLITCHING GETS OUT OF CONTROL. HER SPEECH LOOPS, GLITCHES, BLURS INTO STATIC AND SHE IS GONE. SILENCE)\nDOCTOR: She’s gone. It’s over.\nKEMPTON: Over, Doctor? I don’t think you get to say when it’s over.\nDOCTOR: ‘Doctor’? Not ‘Sir’? You’ve never called me ‘Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Ugh!\nKEMPTON: Telepathic circuits are very versatile things, aren’t they?\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 152\nCOWLEY: I’m presuming that’s the spaceships trying to destroy the barriers.\nACE: Reckon that’s a good guess. How you doing, Mel?\nMEL: Nearly there.\nACE: Good. Cos from the sounds of it so are they.\nCOWLEY: Not any more! That alarm means the barrier’s down! They’re free to depart!\nCOWLEY: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 153\nSPACESHIPS: The barrier is down!/ Freedom is ours!/ Freedom is —\nSPACESHIPS: (A WHOOMPH OF SOUND AS A MAGNETIC PULSE HITS THEM. THEIR VOICES\nBREAK: DOWN)\nSPACESHIPS: Free — duh — uh...\nSPACESHIPS: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 154\nSPACESHIPS: (AS THE SHIPS CRASH OUTSIDE, MEL’S COMPUTER SWITCHES OFF\nABRUPTLY: )\nREGINA: What happened? We have lost power!\nDUNNE: Did you do it in time? Did you stop them?\nMEL: Of course I stopped them. But the pulse erased this computer as well. The fact it’s not working’s the best sign that the plan did work!\nCOWLEY: Hold on — does that mean you erased...?\nACE: Every single computer on Parking, yes. (TO MEL) She’s smart this one, isn’t she?\nMEL: I’m sorry. I imagine that might have set the operation back a little.\nCOWLEY: Just a touch.\nACE: But on the plus side it does mean we’ve saved the galaxy. So I think we’re coming out on top.\nREGINA: What happens now?\nACE: Well, first of all we find the Doctor. Wonder where he’s got to?\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: Argh!\nKEMPTON: It’s a shame about poor old Kempton. But he was human. So his days were numbered.\nDOCTOR: It’s you in there is it, Seraphim? You erased his mind?\nKEMPTON: And I’11 do the same to your TARDIS when I’m finished with you. Let’s see it try to swamp me when it’s deleted.\nKEMPTON: Die, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (CHOKING, STRUGGLING TO GET IT OUT) Please... Seraphim... I’ve got a very important question to ask you —\nKEMPTON: Really? You’1ll just have to live without an answer. Don’t worry. It won’t be for long. The suspense won’t kill you. I will.\nDOCTOR: (CHOKING) Please... just... tell me...\nKEMPTON: Tell you what?\nDOCTOR: (FORCING IT OUT) What’s the quickest journey from Wallaria Prime to Alpha Centauri?!\nKEMPTON: What?\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR: (RECOVERING) I said the quickest journey from Wallaria Prime to Alpha Centauri? What is it?\nKEMPTON: I — I don’t —\nDOCTOR: Tell me!\nKEMPTON: (SLOWLY AT FIRST, GATHERING SPEED) Well, after departing Wallaria Prime on the outbound spaceway you continue for thirty eight point six light years on a bearing of five seven two —\nDOCTOR: Of course, stopping by the remains of the Celation nebula en route, I mean, obviously, who wouldn’t want to see that?\nKEMPTON: Ah, in that case, you would only continue for thirty two point three light years before changing your bearing to —\nDOCTOR: Never using a main hyperspace expressway, of course, always using the trade routes —\nKEMPTON: I — You — You would instead continue on for six point —\nDOCTOR: Taking in Tenubis, Afarria, Gallifrey, Skaro, Telos, Solos, the third moon of Delta Magna, Telos again, Skaro again, right back to Wallaria because you forgot your glasses, slipping through a wormhole into another universe to see what you’d look like with a moustache, Segonax and Slough.\nKEMPTON: I — You — I — You — I — You —\nDOCTOR: And Voldar. And Helieri. And Saturn. And Parking. Tell me. What’s the quickest route that covers all those?\nKEMPTON: I-I-TI-\nKEMPTON: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR: Yes. I thought as much. Once a self-drive, always a self-drive. That part of you was still banked away in there, wasn’t it? Parked, you might say.\nKEMPTON: (STRUGGLING TO SUGGEST A ROUTE THROUGH PAIN AND CONFUSION) Take a — Fly a — I — You -\nDOCTOR: But a human mind is too small to process all that data. Devising an especially complicated journey would burn out the mental connections completely. I’m sorry, Seraphim. But you had to be stopped.\nKEMPTON: I - have — reached my destination!\nDOCTOR: Yes. Your final destination.\nDOCTOR: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR: (A FEW DISTANT FIRES LINGER, FLICKERING. THE DOCTOR, ACE AND\nMEL: WALKING WITH REGINA AND COWLEY )\nCOWLEY: Of course, there’ll be no charge for your visit.\nDOCTOR: That’s most kind of you, Head Warden.\nCOWLEY: Not really. With the force-wall down and the computers kaput I’m not exactly sure how we’d levy one.\nDOCTOR: I appreciate the sentiment, regardless.\nMEL: Best we get out of here before Galactic Heritage’s reinforcements turn up anyway. They’1l be wondering why Fulton hasn’t called in... Might ask a few awkward questions.\nCOWLEY: At least they’1ll be able to get the surviving customers off Dashrah...\nACE: Then get them home. And compensated. It’s going to be a big task.\nDOCTOR: An expensive one. They won’t be able to rebuild this place the same way.\nMEL: That’s if they even bother at all. I mean, it’s not exactly going to have good reputation...\nCOWLEY: They’re going to blame me, I’m sure. And the rest of the Wardens.\nMEL: What are you going to do?\nCOWLEY: Well, Regina here’s offered to let us join her tribe.\nREGINA: It was the least I could do.\nREGINA: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 159\nCOWLEY: And in exchange I’ve offered to help the campaign to make this planet independent.\nREGINA: If the company do not want this world, we would be happy to take it from them.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you would. And I very much hope you achieve that. I’ve a sneaking suspicion a new dawn for Parking is just over the horizon. The pair of you will be.. Well, you’1ll be just the ticket. (CHUCKLES )\nACE: (GROANS) Oh, Doctor...\nCOWLEY: Eh?\nMEL: Ignore him. We usually do.\nDOCTOR: Well, here we are. Bay Lambda.\nDOCTOR: Time for goodbyes. And I would so have loved to have found out what happened to the Dream-Spinners. Ah well. Maybe another time... Goodbye Ms Cowley. Goodbye Regina -\nACE: (INTERRUPTING) Doctor... I don’t see the TARDIS...\nDOCTOR: Eh? What?\nMEL: She’s right, Doctor, it’s not here.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) But this is the right bay, I’m sure of it. Mel, didn’t you memorise where we parked?\nMEL: I did. But it was moved, remember.\nACE: You saw it last, Doctor, you should know.\nACE: #227: THE HIGH PRICE OF PARKING by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 160\nCOWLEY: (ASIDE) I think, perhaps, we should leave them to it.\nREGINA: I quite agree.\nDOCTOR: Let me think. I recall the signs were yellow...\nMEL: That’s your first mistake, the signs here are green...\nACE: Do you think we should ask someone?\nDOCTOR: No, no, Ace, I can get this, I can get this...
