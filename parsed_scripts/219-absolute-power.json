Get up off the floor, you fool!\nYCE: CONSTANCE AND FLORRIE ENTER.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, be careful!\nDOCTOR: (CROUCHING DOWN) There might still be a chance to (BEAT —\nREALISING: WYKE IS VERY DEAD) Oh...\nYCE: Is he...?\nFLORRIE: (HAMMY SNIFFLES) Oh dear! Oh no!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. Professor Wyke.. is dead.\nDOCTOR: SCENE CONTINUES:\nDOCTOR: 21. j%QINT. YCE MINING CORP SITE OFFICES — ANALYSIS LAB [CONTINUED ]\nYCE: What?! How could this have happened?!\nDOCTOR: It looks to me like he was electrocuted, but by what?\nFLORRIE: Is there an entry wound? Or a flash or exit burn? (BEAT) (KNOWING SHE’S LOOKING TOO SMART) Sorry, silly me — I watched an episode of ‘Galactamedics’ yesterday afternoon... it was all about this sort of stuff.\nDOCTOR: I see. Well, since you’ve mentioned it, I can’t find any sign of an exit burn. Mr Yce, I’d like to suggest that an urgent post-mortem is performed on this man.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 36\nYCE: Erm.. well, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but that’s not Yce Corporation’s company policy. In the event of an accident, [all deaths...]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) And what if the circumstances surrounding the death are highly unusual?\nYCE: (SHAKEN) I’m not sure I like what you’re insinuating.\nDOCTOR: I’m not insinuating anything, Mister Yce. You appear to be inferring something though.\nFULL: LIGHTING AND POWER RETURNS.\nCONSTANCE: The power’s back on.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Mister Yce — I believe that you were about to accede to my request?\nYCE: There’s a well-equipped facility at the Ursa Aquarii Interplanetary University, but it’s two hours’ shuttle flight from here... and it’ll be expensive.\nDOCTOR: A man has died in suspicious circumstances. What price would you put on the safety of everyone at this site?\nYCE: Very well, Doctor. You’ve made your point, but I really don’t know what you’re worrying about — this was clearly some unfortunate accident. Nonetheless — I will make the arrangements.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (SPOTTING THE ARTEFACTS) Ah-ha! And are these the artefacts that you and the Professor were talking about? This metallic vessel, this cylinder and that rod?\nAMMAR: ARRIVES, SKIDDING TO A HALT.\nAMMAR: There you all are! I’ve been looking for you... for... a- ... (SPOTTING THE BODY) What’s happened here?\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 37\nFLORRIE: (DOWN) He’s dead. Professor Wyke is dead!\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry, Ammar. The Professor appears to have been working on these objects when [something happened and]\nAMMAR: (INTERRUPTING) No! No, no no no...\nAMMAR: HE TURNS, DOES A RUNNER.\nYCE: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Ammar! Get back here! (BEAT) What’s wrong with you, man?\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, should I...?\nDOCTOR: An excellent idea, Mrs Clarke. Thank you!\nCONSTANCE: (RUNNING AND CALLING AFTER HIM) Ammar! Come back! It’s alright!\nCONSTANCE: THEY RUN OFF DOWN THE CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINING THE ARTEFACTS) Mister Yce, I strongly suggest that these ‘artefacts’ are locked away somewhere safe!\nYCE: Errrr.. and why [would that be, Doctor? ]\nDOCTOR: (PATRONISING. INSISTENT. INTERRUPTING) These are ancient artefacts, Mister Yce! They need to be looked after.\nYCE: (RELIEVED NOT TO HAVE BEEN FOUND OUT) Oh! Yes, of course. Quite right! (BEAT) Florrie, my darling — could you fetch one of the lab technicians to arrange their safe storage?\nFLORRIE: Yes, of course. I’1l fetch the lab technician straight away.\nSHE: TURNS AND EXITS.\nDOCTOR: And Mister Yce?\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 38\nYCE: (NOW FRUSTRATED) Yes, Doctor?!\nDOCTOR: I also suggest a complete lockdown of all transport — of people and materials — in and out of this site. Agreed?\nYCE: There’s something we can easily agree on, Doctor. Consider it done. (BEAT) Might I also suggest that any academic activities here are paused also?\nDOCTOR: Very well.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 39\nCONSTANCE: RUNS UP TO AMMAR. LIGHT WIND AND DUST STORM.\nCONSTANCE: Ammar, wait, please! (BEAT) Wait!\nSHE: GRABS HIS ARM AND PULLS HIM UP. RUNNING STOPS.\nAMMAR: Please, let me go! I want to get out of here!\nCONSTANCE: Ammar, it’s alright — it was an accident, most likely. Whatever is the matter?\nAMMAR: I want to go. Please. Let me go!\nCONSTANCE: Alright. If you’1l tell me what’s wrong. You know something, don’t you?\nAMMAR: It’s not safe here, we need to leave. Please, you have to come with me too!\nCONSTANCE: I’m flattered, but we’ve only just met.\nAMMAR: (POLITE LAUGH) No, I didn’t mean... Sorry. Look, [we really]\nCONSTANCE: (CALMLY INTERRUPTING) Ammar... Whatever it is you know, it might be important. It might even save lives.\nAMMAR: Very well. During the early phases of this mining mission, I became aware of certain stories from Teymahrian history — regarding a mysterious object, and a cylindrical casket.\nCONSTANCE: One of the ‘artefacts’ that Wyke was working on!\nAMMAR: Perhaps. It’s little more than an ancient myth, but stories have been passed down around this system about an ancient god on Teymah, who derived his power from a special cylindrical casket.\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 40\nCONSTANCE: I see...\nAMMAR: The legends speak also of an ancient cult that tried to revive the banished god using the casket, but with the most terrible consequences.\nCONSTANCE: The extinction event...?\nAMMAR: Perhaps. As I say, it’s only a story, and maybe I’ve just lost my head over it all, but...\nCONSTANCE: A little too much of it seems to fit our current situation for it to just be a story. (BEAT) Ammar, you need to share this information with the Doctor.\nAMMAR: But I don’t want to!\nCONSTANCE: (CHARMING) For me, Ammar? Please?\nAMMAR: (SLIGHTLY FLUSTERED) Alright, Mrs Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: Call me Constance. (BEAT) Come along!\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THE DOCTOR APPROACHES. SLIGHTLY BREATHLESS.\nDOCTOR: Well done, Mrs Clarke! You caught up with our flighty friend, I\nDOCTOR: see.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor! What on Earth happened in there?\nAMMAR: It’s not safe here, Doctor. You must leave. We must all leave.\nDOCTOR: I think I’m beginning to share your concerns, Ammar, but for now at least — we must investigate further.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 41\nYCE: This is an utter disaster. Just imagine the health and safety investigation... let alone the potential insurance claim, and the corresponding hike in our premiums!\nLAB TECHNICIAN: I’1ll make my report as generic as I can, sir. I’ve moved the artefacts to the sample storage area in the medical bay.\nYCE: Good. I suppose we’ll also need to arrange for this blasted autopsy.\nLAB TECHNICIAN: Just let me know, sir. I’1ll do whatever you need.\nYCE: Don’t worry. You will.\nTECH: WALKS AWAY. DOOR OPENS. CROSS TO:\nTECH: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 42\nFLORRIE: IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CALL.\nFLORRIE: I repeat — Wyke is dead. [He was]\nDOOR: OPENS. YCE ENTERS.\nYCE: Florrie? Who are you calling?\nFLORRIE: (FLUSTERED. FAKING) So we’re confirmed? A shuttle will deliver the body within the next 24 to 36 hours. Thank you. (COMMS END) Sorry about that, darling — I wanted to get the post mortem arranged for poor Professor Wyke.\nYCE: My dear, you didn’t have to do that. It’s rather a macabre duty for a pretty thing like you.\nFLORRIE: I know, Lyam, but... I just felt so helpless, and I wanted to do something useful. I’m sorry for interfering.\nYCE: Not at all, my love. I’m very grateful. Come along, let’s go and inform the Doctor that the post mortem arrangements have been made.\nSHE: GETS UP. THEY EXIT TOGETHER.\nSHE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 43\nDUST: STORM BLOWS. VOICES RAISED OVER IT.\nAMMAR: But does it make any sense, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s not outside the realms of possibility that there’s some connection. (BEAT) Look at these!\nCONSTANCE: The symbols?\nDOCTOR: I’m not surprised that your specialists failed to translate them.\nAMMAR: Is it not some sort of ancient Teymahrian?\nDOCTOR: Almost certainly not. Luckily, we have a very talented cryptographer and linguist with us, in the form of Mrs Clarke. I did promise Yce that we wouldn’t carry on with our ‘academic duties’ — but there’s no harm in doing a little translation and code-breaking for fun, is there?\nCONSTANCE: We can certainly give it a try, Doctor. After you.\nDOCTOR: Well, I can see that this symbol reappears multiple times, and this sequence here.. I recognise it from somewhere. I’m sure of it.\nFADING: OUT.\nFADING: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 44\nFADING: QUIET. A DOCTOR AND TECHNICIAN CAN BE HEARD (MUFFLED) ON THEIR\nWAY: OUT.\nMEDICAL DOCTOR: I don’t understand why these old bits of junk need to be in my lab. (SIGHS) Any confirmation from the university hospital yet about the autopsy?\nLAB TECHNICIAN: Nothing yet, doctor.\nMEDICAL DOCTOR: Yce’s bit of fluff organised it, did she? Useless girl.\nLAB TECHNICIAN: Computer. Lights off.\nWYKE: stored\nWYKE: (INSIDE BODY BAG: WAKES WITH A START, TAKING A HUGE BREATH. COUGHS. IT TAKES HIM A FEW SECONDS TO STABILISE HIS BREATHING)\nWYKE: HE UNZIPS THE BODY BAG FROM THE INSIDE AND CLIMBS OUT.\nWYKE: (NOW DISTORTED. CRACKLED. WHISPERED. WEAK) I must get to the\nWYKE: sphere.\nWYKE: HE EXITS.\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 45\nDUST: STORM IS WORSE NOW. VERY LOUD. SAND HITS THE GROUP AND THE SPHERE.\nDOCTOR: . Well, that rules that one out. Hang on a mo!\nDOCTOR: GETS A NOTEBOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET.\nDOCTOR: I keep going back to that line of symbols there. I’m sure I recognise them.. Perhaps (FLICKING THROUGH NOTEBOOK) they’re in my notebook somewhere...\nCONSTANCE: What about this sign, Doctor? It’s wing-like. Could it be a symbol for flight, or space travel?\nDOCTOR: It could well be... Do you have that section fully transcribed?\nCONSTANCE: Almost everything from this panel, yes.\nAMMAR: Doctor! Constance! The storm is getting too severe. We have to get back inside!\nCONSTANCE: Don’t worry, Ammar. I think I have enough from here...\nDOCTOR: How come he’s allowed to call you Constance?!\nAMMAR: Come along, please! Let’s get you inside!\nAMMAR: THEY MAKE THEIR WAY FROM THE SPHERE ALONG THE NOISY GANGWAY.\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 46\nAMMAR: YCE AND FLORRIE WALKING.\nYCE: Where has that curly-haired buffoon got to?\nFLORRIE: You mean the Doctor?\nYCE: Yes... (MOCKINGLY) ‘The Doctor’. Something about him still makes me uncomfortable. Where’s he got to? Would you go wandering off in a situation like this?\nDOOR: OPENS. STORM BLOWS IN. DOCTOR, CONSTANCE, AMMAR ENTER.\nFLORRIE: There you are, Doctor! We were worried that perhaps you were lost?\nDOCTOR: I am never, ever lost!\nYCE: Glad to have you back, Doctor. Has Ammar been keeping you entertained?\nDOCTOR: Very much so! We’ve been making some progress on translating the symbols on the sphere!\nDOCTOR: ‘YOU'VE WHAT?!’ MUSIC STING\nYCE: Have you indeed! I thought we’d agreed that all work should cease for the time being...\nAMMAR: I’m sorry, sir, I wasn’t aware that there was a moratorium [on the U.A.X.S.’s work here]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING. COVERING) Well yes, but we took this on as more of a hobby-type activity...\nDOCTOR: Well, I say we — it’s Mrs Clarke who’s the real expert.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 47\nYCE: I see.. How dedicated you both are to your.. hobby. (BEAT) And what have you discovered so far, Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: Well, Mr Yce, our efforts were cut short by this dust storm, but I’m fairly certain that the symbols are a set of instructions.\nYCE: (SIMULTANEOUSLY) For what?\nFLORRIE: (SIMULTANEOUSLY) For what?\nCONSTANCE: For some sort of religious ceremony, perhaps? It’s hard to tell until I can see more.\nYCE: Most impressive, Mrs Clarke! (BEAT) I have an idea, regarding the second site...\nCONSTANCE: Where you found more of the symbols?\nYCE: Where we discovered the artefacts, too.. Restricted access, of course, Since the area has yet to be fully inventoried and catalogued, but you know what? I think I’1l allow you to take a look.\nCONSTANCE: I’d certainly be keen to see it, once the dust storm’s passed.\nAMMAR: (SEEING HIS CHANCE TO BE ALONE WITH CONSTANCE) Errr — I can take Mrs Clarke, sir? (RECOVERING PROFESSIONALISM) If that would help you, of course.\nYCE: Thank you, Ammar. But I’d like to take our guest there personally. (BEAT) There’s no need to wait, Mrs Clarke! The second site is fully covered.. Perhaps we could go there now, in one of the buggies?\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? Could you carry on with the Sphere transcriptions, while I go to work on the second site?\nDOCTOR: You don’t need my permission, Mrs Clarke.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 48\nCONSTANCE: In that case — I’m ready when you are, Mister Yce.\nYCE: Absolutely! Florrie, my dear, will you look after the good Doctor?\nFLORRIE: Of course. Doctor, before you start work on the transcriptions — I expect you must be thirsty after all that time out in the dust storm?\nDOCTOR: I am indeed. Another layer of sand on the tongue, I’m afraid! You don’t happen to have any Ginger Beer do you?\nFLORRIE: Of course we do, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Well, I shall see you both when you get back!\nYCE: Yes! Of course. Come along, Mrs Clarke. Uh’goobye!\nYCE: THE FOUR GO THEIR TWO SEPARATE DIRECTIONS.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 49\nANGRY: STORM CONTINUES, AS WYKE LURCHES ALONG THE GANGWAY.\nWYKE: We have the items... (LURCHING ALONG) I can see the sphere... We. Will. Prevail.\nANOTHER: SET OF FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ALONG THE GANGWAY.\nMINER: #1:\nMINER: Who’s that? (BEAT — GETTING CLOSER). (STUNNED) Professor Wyke?! But... I.. I thought you were...\nWYKE: Dead. Correct. (BEAT) Now, get out of my way!\nMINER: #1:\nMINER: But... I.. Your skin. It’s so pale. Are you... I don’t understand!\nWYKE: Move! Or I will kill you. (BEAT) Go!\nMINER: #1: (IN SHOCK) What? Please! No! No! (HE LEGS IT) Help! Heeeeeelp!\nHIS: FEET POUND ALONG THE GANGWAY AS THE STORM BLOWS HARDER.\nHIS: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 50\nHIS: FADE UP. CANTEEN IS BUSY AND BUSTLING.\nDOCTOR: This is more like it. I must say — I do enjoy a touch of corporate hospitality every now and again!\nFLORRIE: You're easy to please, Doctor. Here’s your ginger beer!\nFLORRIE: THE DOCTOR TAKES A LARGE SWIG.\nDOCTOR: (VERY REFRESHED) That is an excellent ginger beer!\nFLORRIE: The best-selling brand in the galaxy, Doctor. Earth exports are big business throughout Ursa Aquarii. It’s how Lyam originally made his fortune!\nDOCTOR: Oh! Is this one of his exports?\nFLORRIE: It is. Yce is more of an empire than an enterprise!\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. If you don’t mind me asking — how did you and... Lyam meet?\nFLORRIE: It’s not much of a story, I’m afraid. (BEAT) About eleven months ago, I was working in a bar near one of Lyam’s corporate HQs — in a system not far from here...\nFADING: OUT.\nFADING: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 51\nBUGGY: PULLS UP JUST NEXT TO THE SECOND DIG SITE.\nYCE: This is it, Constance... May I call you Constance?\nCONSTANCE: You may.\nYCE: We can walk the last part — it’s mostly under cover!\nYCE: THEY EXIT THE VEHICLE. AS THE JOIN EACH OTHER ROUND THE FRONT:\nYCE: How long have you been with the U.A.X.S., Constance?\nCONSTANCE: Not long. I was brought in from another post to work as the Doctor’s.. assistant.\nYCE: Assistant? I must say, you seem rather more than a mere assistant.\nCONSTANCE: I’m flattered, Mister Yce. Working with the Doctor certainly keeps me on my toes! (BEAT) And what about you? What brings your operation to Teymah?\nYCE: This barren place? Two reasons, really. Firstly commercial — Teymah is rich in a number of minerals that are rather valuable across this system — and only the Yce Corportation has the necessary processing technology, and the license to drill here... It’s a protected site, so it took us nearly four years to get the required paperwork from this sector’s governing body.\nCONSTANCE: And the second?\nYCE: A passing interest in Xenoarchaeology. I was rather hoping we might find something exciting during the mining...\nCONSTANCE: And it seems you were right about that. You must be pleased!\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 52\nYCE: Oh yes. It’s all coming together nicely — just a few kinks to iron out! (BEAT) Here we are — just up ahead.. can you see the entrance under the canopy just there?\nYCE: THEY APPROACH THE DOOR.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 53\nGENERAL: CANTEEN NOISE CONTINUES. DOCTOR PUTS HIS GLASS DOWN.\nFLORRIE: And of course, I had to say yes. I knew from that first day that he was the one for me.\nDOCTOR: A whirlwind romance, you might say?\nFLORRIE: I suppose so, Doctor. I know Lyam’s not perfect... but there’s something very special about him, something worth pushing through the initial ‘front’. And I think I’ve almost got past Des\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. He’s clearly a very lucky man.\nFLORRIE: Flattered, I’m sure, Doctor.\nAMMAR: COMES THUNDERING IN. SOME DINERS DISTURBED.\nAMMAR: (FRIGHTENED) Miss Solomon! Errr.. Florrie! Something has happened!\nFLORRIE: What is it, Ammar? The Doctor and I are having a [nice chat]\nAMMAR: (INTERRUPTING) Please, Florrie. I’ve just received word that... (SWALLOWS HARD) Professor Wyke has been spotted in the compound. Walking around!\nFLORRIE: What?!\nBOTH: STAND UP, PUSHING BACK SEATS.\nDOCTOR: We need to find him, and quickly!\nDOCTOR: THEY DEPART.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: YCE AND CONSTANCE WALK THROUGH THE DIG SITE.\nYCE: He really is a rather odd fellow — your friend, ‘the Doctor...’\nCONSTANCE: I don’t really know him that well, I’m afraid. You’re not suspicious of him, I hope, Mister Yce?\nYCE: No, no, not suspicious. He just seems rather... eccentric. I was hoping you’d be able to fill me in on his background.\nYCE: THEY STOP WALKING.\nCONSTANCE: Not really. We’ve only been on a few trips together so far... Adventures, almost, you might say. (BEAT) My goodness! This is a temple, I think! — And just look at that...!\nSHE: RUSHES OVER TO...\nCONSTANCE: Mister Yce! Do you know what this is?!\nYCE: (LYING) Just more of the inscriptions, I think?\nCONSTANCE: I think it’s essentially a Rosetta Stone!\nYCE: I don’t follow. A what? Will it help you decipher the symbols?\nCONSTANCE: It’s the same inscription in several languages!\nYCE: (KNOWS. STILL LYING) Is it?\nCONSTANCE: Yes! And I can read one of them!! If we really work on it, this extra information could help us do it in weeks, or even days!\nYCE: (CONCERNED. COVERING) Oh. (BEAT) Well... most impressive, Mrs Clarke! (BEAT) Please, excuse me for a moment. I’11 be back shortly. (LYING) I need to send a message back to the compound, and the dust storm is interfering with my personal communicator.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 55\nCONSTANCE: (BEAT — SHE’S ABSORBED BY THE SYMBOLS) Be my guest! I’1ll get to work here. Plenty to keep me busy — I’1l probably be tied up for hours working on these! But we should make very rapid progress now. This is a wonderful find!\nYCE: (FAKING) So it seems. Good luck. See you very shortly!\nYCE: HE LEAVES HER TO WORK.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 56\nYCE: DOCTOR, FLORRIE AND AMMAR MOVE AGAINST A TIDE OF RUNNING,\nTERRIFIED: WORKERS.\nWORKERS: Get out of here! / Get away! / It can’t be him!! / What’s the matter with him? / Run! Quickly! / Keep away from me!!\nDOCTOR: Excuse me! (BEAT) Please — stop! (BEAT) Won’t ell me what’s happening!\nFLORRIE: Doctor! Can it really be Wyke?\nAMMAR: (ACCELERATING PANIC) It can’t be — we saw him earlier. He was dead! How can it be him?!\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. I can’t get a sensible answer from any of the miners!\nTHREE: MORE WORKERS RUN TOWARDS THEM.\nFLORRIE: (FIRMLY GRABBING A WORKER) STOP!\nMINER: #2: Let me go!! Please!\nFLORRIE: Not until you tell us what’s going on!\nMINER: #2: It’s that Professor Wyke — the dead one — he’s beside the sphere!\nDOCTOR: Is he now?! What’s he doing there...?\nFLORRIE: Trying to open it...?\nMINER: #2:\nMINER: Who cares what he’s doing? He’s walking around like, like a zombie!!! Now please (SURGE OF EFFORT) Let me GO! (BREAKS FREE)\nAMMAR: I can’t believe it!\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR: Nor me, Ammar. Something very odd is going on. (BEAT. THOUGHTFUL) You’re rather stronger than you look, Florrie — arresting such a burly chap like that...\nFLORRIE: I’1ll take that as a compliment, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Look, I suggest you two go back inside — get out of this storm, and try to raise Yce and Constance on the comms system. Get them back here as soon as possible!\nFLORRIE: Alright, Doctor. Then perhaps we should go to the stores and check for anything we could defend ourselves with?\nDOCTOR: (‘ODD’) That seems a little premature. But I suppose it might be sensible.\nAMMAR: (WET. STROPPY) Are you suggesting we prepare for hand to hand combat with a zombie?! That is not in my employment contract!\nFLORRIE: Better safe than sorry!\nDOCTOR: Quite so (BEAT). I need to fetch something from my... conveyance, before I go to the sphere. I shall leave a note for Constance there too. Please — when you speak to her, will you tell her to go to there and read the note?\nFLORRIE: Of course! Let’s go. (BEAT) Come on, Ammar!\nSHE: HAULS HIM WITH HER BY HIS SLEEVE.\nAMMAR: (DRAGGED) (CHILDLIKE MOAN) Ooooohhh.\nAMMAR: THEY PART WAYS.\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 58\nCONSTANCE: IS ALONE, WORKING ON THE TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION.\nCONSTANCE: This must be the TARDIS’ doing. Let’s see now...\nSHE: EXAMINES THE STONE.\nCONSTANCE: Well, I was right about one thing. The inscriptions on the sphere are almost certainly a set of instructions... but not for a religious ceremony.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 59\nLOW: HUM.

PATTING HIMSELF DOWN) Pen. Pen? Pen! (BEAT) Ah ha!\nDOCTOR: HE SWIFTLY SCRAWLS A NOTE. HALF READING IT AS HE WRITES.\nDOCTOR: (MOSTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE) Dear Mrs Clarke. Read this carefully and follow my instructions to the letter. First — prime the telepathic circuits for a transmit and receive sequence — the orange and blue switches on the panel nearest the door.\nFADING: OUT.\nFADING: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 61\nCONSTANCE: MAKES NOTES AND THINKS ALOUD.\nCONSTANCE: So, I suppose in that context — this would mean ‘deriving power for...’ For what? For... erm... ‘awakening’? No — ‘revival’!\nYCE: ARRIVES.\nYCE: And how are we getting on, Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: (REALLY QUITE ENTHUSED) Rather well actually, although I think you'll be surprised by what these say. You see this section here? So far as I can tell, the sphere was built by some alien species that arrived here centuries ago. I can’t translate the word that names the species, but these instructions somehow allow for the revival of that species. Something about diverting an underground river? Are there any rivers here — underground or otherwise?\nYCE: APPROACHES AND STANDS DIRECTLY BEHIND HER.\nCONSTANCE: (CONT’D) Mister Yce? (SHE TURNS) Mister Yce!? That’s one of those artefacts, you’re holding, isn’t it?\nYCE: You are a clever one, aren’t you Mrs Clarke? I’m sorry to be so ungentlemanly about this...\nYCE: STRIKES HER AROUND THE BACK OF THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER OUT COLD.\nYCE: . but you’ve got too close to the truth for comfort. (BEAT) Now, let’s get you tied up, so you can be at the centre of the action!\nYCE: LUGS HER UP AGAINST A PILLAR.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 62\nFLORRIE: IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A COMMUNICATION TO AN UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY.\nFLORRIE: Look. I can’t make this any clearer to you. Stay in orbit!\nPHEENAN: (BADLY DISTORTED) Commander Kohrbal is not satisfied with your latest status report, agent. We are en route.\nFLORRIE: No, no, no! Everything is under control. Any interruption now\nFLORRIE: could ruin everything. Can’t you see that?\nPHEENAN: (BADLY DISTORTED) The decision has been made.\nRUNNING: FOOTSTEPS ARRIVE OUTSIDE.\nFLORRIE: Someone’s coming. But do not come to Teymah!\nCOMMS: OFF. DOOR OPENS. IT’S AMMAR — PANTING, DISTRESSED.\nAMMAR: Miss Solomon! I was right! Yce — he’s taken the artefacts from\nAMMAR: the store!! We must go after him!\nFLORRIE: Agreed. Come on, Ammar! We’1l take a buggy. I’11 drive!\nFLORRIE: THEY EXIT AT SPEED.\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 63\nCONSTANCE: COMES ROUND SLOWLY. YCE’S MONOLOGUE BECOMES GRADUALLY CLEARER.\nYCE: (WHILE CONCENTRATING. SETTING SOMETHING UP) What to do with the Doctor? Hmmmm. I suppose I’1l have to dispose of him as well.\nCONSTANCE: (COMING ROUND. DISORIENTATED) Mr Yce? (BEAT) You... you hit me?\nYCE: Welcome back, Mrs Clarke. I’m afraid, though, that this is goodbye.\nCONSTANCE: (STILL GETTING BEARINGS) And why is that?\nYCE: Take a look around you. Do you see these compact little boxes strapped onto the temple pillars?\nCONSTANCE: Yes...\nYCE: Monodistronic explosives. Very destructive.\nCONSTANCE: What on Earth are you playing at? Explain yourself right now [or I shall call the Doctor]\nYCE: (INTERRUPTING) Shush now, Constance. (BEAT) It’s a shame. In any other situation, I’d have offered you a job. (BEAT)\nYCE: Uh’ goobye!\nYCE: ACTIVATES THE BOMBS, CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIG PIT AND SCARPERS. BEEPING OF MONODISTRONIC EXPLOSIVES.\nCONSTANCE: (STRAINS TO ESCAPE) Ugh... Oh dear. I really should have paid more attention to that escapology course at Bletchley. (GIVES UP STRAINING) Nothing else for it I suppose. (BEAT) HELP! Heeeeeelllp! Help me! Doctor!? Anyone?!\nCONSTANCE: NOTHING.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 64\nCONSTANCE: Oh well. It was worth a try.\nCONSTANCE: IN THE DISTANCE THE BUGGY FIRES UP AND DRIVES AWAY.\nCONSTANCE: And there he goes. What a delightful host! (CONTINUES TRYING TO ESCAPE).\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: FINISHES HIS NOTE. LAST SCRIBBLES.\nDOCTOR: If all else fails, stay in the TARDIS. Good luck. (BEAT) P.S. Whatever you do, don’t leave the TARDIS! (BEAT) P.P.S. I mean it!\nPUTS: DOWN PEN.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) There!\nDOCTOR: HE PLACES THE NOTE ON THE CONSOLE. AND TURNS TO LEAVE.\nDOCTOR: Oops! (TURNS ON HIS HEEL) I almost forgot you!\nDOCTOR: HE EJECTS THE MOBILE TELEPATHIC CIRCUIT FROM THE CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: I told Constance you’d come in handy at some point!\nDOCTOR: HE EXITS.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 66\nQUIET: EXCEPT FOR A LIGHT WIND.\nCONSTANCE: Anyone?! (BEAT) Help! (BEAT) Help me, please!\nDUST: STORM BLOWS.\nCONSTANCE: Oh dear.

WYKE IS IN THE SPHERE. VERY LOW RATE, LOW LEVEL ALIEN HUM CAN BE HEARD. WYKE CRACKLES WITH ENERGY AND NOW HAS A DISTORTED VOICE.\nWYKE: Hurry, Yce. The Ninexie require you to deliver on your promises.\nWYKE: BREATHES HEAVILY AS HE MOVES EQUIPMENT AND ARTEFACTS AROUND THE SPHERE’S CENTRAL CHAMBER.\nWYKE: We were so close... but after that interminable wait, finally — it is our time.\nSTOPS: WHAT HE’S DOING AND FOCUSES ON THE INTRUDER.\nWYKE: Get out! Keep away! If you wish to live you will leave this place.\nWYKE: THE DOCTOR STEPS INTO THE CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Are those my only two options? (BEAT) I say, Professor Wyke. You’re looking rather... peaky. You do know that you were dead earlier?\nWYKE: Enough, Doctor. Leave this place, or I shall destroy you.\nDOCTOR: I was rather hoping for a little more conversation, Wyke. You are Professor Wyke, aren’t you?\nWYKE: As you said, Doctor. Wyke is dead. Now — GO!\nDOCTOR: Wyke is dead, and yet you know my name. (BEAT) So you — whatever you are — have access to Wyke’s memories?\nWYKE: We have access to all of Wyke’s memories.\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: A parasite? Is that what’s in there? (BEAT) Yes! You — the creature I’m speaking to — you’re using Wyke’s corpse as a host — a temporary shell. (BEAT) Go on! (GAMESHOW STYLE) Introduce yourself! What’s your name, and where do you come from? (BEAT)\nDOCTOR: (MAINTAINING OVERLY JOVIAL TONE) Alright, I’ll start, if you’re feeling shy. (CLEARS THROAT). I’m the Doctor, and I’m from Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. My hobbies include...\nWYKE: (INTERRUPTING) Enough, Time Lord!\nDOCTOR: Ah, so you know Gallifrey?\nWYKE: The Ninexie know your race.\nDOCTOR: The Ninexie? Now, where have I heard that name before? You’re not related to the Nix are you?\nWYKE: We are not, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Not terribly chatty, are you? — So, what is this sphere, then? What’s its purpose? Obviously, it’s not a ship. So if you’re not trying to escape, then what are you up to? Fairly sparsely decorated... but this central console looks interesting. Some sort of generator, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: A COUPLE OF FOOTSTEPS, SKID TO A HALT. GUN COCKED.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nYCE: Oh yes, Doctor. How good to see you again. (BEAT) I’11 guard him, Wyke. You may continue with the procedure.\nWYKE: Is the secondary chamber prepared?\nYCE: Of course, I have the trigger device here.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 70\nYCE: HE HOLDS IT UP. IT’S LIVE. BEEPING.\nDOCTOR: I should have realised earlier about you, Yce. Far too smarmy to be one of the ‘good guys’. (BEAT — SEES THE DETONATOR) Is\nDOCTOR: that the trigger for a monodistronic charge?\nYCE: Very observant, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I try! (BEAT) And what exactly is it that you’re blowing up, Yce? Monodistronic explosives are incredibly powerful...\nYCE: (SARCASTIC) That’s a relief, Doctor. I was concerned they wouldn’t be powerful enough to do the job!\nDOCTOR: Which is?\nYCE: To divert an underground river near the second dig site through the ancient channels that run beneath this structure.\nDOCTOR: But why, Yce?! (BEAT) Hang on — where’s Constance?\nWYKE: Everything is ready, Yce. Now.\nDOCTOR: (CONCERNED/ANGRY) Where is Constance?!\nYCE: Oh, Doctor. You really should be more careful with your pets!\nDOCTOR: No! What have you done with her?!\nYCE: I’m afraid that poor Constance is about to be involved ina tragic accident. Shame she got so ‘tied up’ at the second dig Site, but really — she only has herself to blame.\nDOCTOR: No, Yce, stop!\nDOCTOR: LUNGES TO GRAB DETONATOR BUT IS GRABBED BY WYKE. WYKE’S\nGRASP: IS ELECTRICALLY CHARGED AND IS PAINFUL FOR THE DOCTOR.\nGRASP: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: Argh! (BEAT. CONFUSED) Ow. You shocked me, Wyke.. an electric shock...!\nWYKE: I have him, Yce. Continue.\nYCE: Gladly (BEAT) Sorry, Doctor — but Mrs Clarke is out of time.\nYCE: HE PRIMES THE DETONATOR. BEEP BEEP.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) No!!\nDUST: STORM BLOWS THROUGH THE SITE. THE BOMBS PRIME. ACTIVATION PIPS. FIVE. FOUR. THREE.\nDUST: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: (RESTRAINED AND IN PAIN) Yce! Whatever you’re doing here, Constance isn’t a threat to you! Please! Stop!\nDOCTOR: TWO.

EXPLOSION SHAKES THE SURFACE.\nDOCTOR: Yce! (WYKE’S GRIP TIGHTENS. DOCTOR DROPS TO HIS KNEES IN PAIN)\nYCE: Oh, shush now Doctor! It’s too late. She’s dead! .. And soon you will be, too!\nDOCTOR: (HEAVY HEARTED) Constance! (BEAT) But why, Yce? Why have you done this?\nYCE: The river we’ve diverted will flow under the sphere, powering it up using the Ninexie technology, and then I get my reward. (BEAT) Ah — I hear water!\nSTRANGE: NOISE BECOMES APPARENT. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, IT’S\nCLEARLY: RUNNING WATER. A HUGE UNDERGROUND RIVER IS SUDDENLY\nFLOWING: BENEATH THE SPHERE. MACHINERY IN THE SPHERE BEGINS TO\nPOWER: UP.\nWYKE: Very good, Yce. The Doctor here has misled us — he is in fact, a Time Lord.\nYCE: A what?\nDOCTOR: An alien. An imposter, Yce. Very much like our friend Wyke\nDOCTOR: here!\nMACHINERY: BECOMES MORE ACTIVE.\nMACHINERY: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 74\nYCE: Do be quiet, Doctor. I know he’s a Ninexis now. What do you take me for? (BEAT) Wyke — when do we get the power?\nWYKE: Very soon. The new Ninexis progeny will be generated in a few minutes’ time.\nDOCTOR: Yce.. you knew that the revival of these... things... these parasites, would kill Wyke?!\nYCE: I had my suspicions. Even if you and your pet hadn’t arrived, then I’d still have let Wyke initiate the ceremony. That’s business, Doctor — if someone else can take the risk, but you still profit — that’s the way to go!\nDOCTOR: What noble means.\nYCE: The means are not important. The result is all that matters!\nDOCTOR: And what result are you hoping for?\nYCE: What every being truly desires, Doctor. Absolute power over life and death!\nDOCTOR: This doesn’t make any sense, Yce. Are you so blinded by your desire for power that you can’t see what is actually happening here?!\nYCE: Do elaborate, Doctor! I’m fascinated. (YAWNS)\nDOCTOR: Well, I... haven’t quite worked it out myself yet, but...\nYCE: Why doesn’t that surprise me? From the moment I met you I could see your mouth moved far quicker than your brain, Doctor.\nWYKE: Enough! Both of you! The device is not working at full capacity. Assist me, Yce!\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 75\nYCE: I’m not really a hands-on sort of entrepreneur, Wyke.\nDOCTOR: The console in the centre? I’m not entirely familiar with the controls, but I think I can see how it works... What exactly is the device, Wyke?\nWYKE: A generator, Doctor. We need electricity to reproduce.\nDOCTOR: Electromitosis, eh? Fascinating. You know — I remember reading about it at the academy back on Gallifrey, but I’ve never met a lifeform that uses it to procreate.\nYCE: I’m glad we could assist with your continuing professional development, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Quite. Most kind. By the way — just from some brief observation, I’d say that your main issue is a corroded resistance nanomodulator.\nWYKE: And what would your solution be, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, it just so happens that I have a similar piece of technology in my pocket — I carry around all sorts of things you see...\nYCE: Obviously a trap, Doctor. A pathetic plan, from a pathetic man.\nDOCTOR: It’s really not. (BEAT) I’m rather hoping if I can prove useful to you, you’ll spare my life and not use me as a host body when the next Ninexis is... produced!\nWYKE: An interesting proposition, Doctor. (BEAT) Yce — find the device.\nYCE: Very well. Hands on your head, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (RAISING HANDS) Alright, alright. It’s in...\nYCE: DIVES FOR HIS RIGHT POCKET.\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR: (ALARMED) .. my left pocket!\nYCE: CHANGES POCKETS.\nYCE: And what am I looking for?\nDOCTOR: A small, cylindrical device...\nYCE: (TAKING SOMETHING OUT) This?\nDOCTOR: No — that’s a yo-yo.\nYCE: DROPS THE YOYO AND TAKES SOMETHING ELSE OUT.\nYCE: This?\nDOCTOR: That’s it. It should actually fit directly in line with that part of the circuit, Wyke.\nWYKE: Give it to me.\nYCE: But what if it’s [a trap]\nWYKE: (INTERRUPTING) I’m not an idiot, Yce. I am myself electrical in nature. I can check its function by passing myself through it.\nWYKE: PASSES HIS ELECTROPARASITE THROUGH THE DEVICE. HE HISSES AND GROWLS AS THE PARASITE RUNS FROM HIS INDEX FINGERS TO THUMB. A FEW SPARKS. WHEN THE PARASITE RETURNS TO WYKE HE REACTS AND IS MORE BREATHLESS INITIALLY.\nYCE: Well?\nWYKE: He appears to be telling the truth. Thank you Doctor, you have been most helpful.\nDOCTOR: Well, I know when I’m beaten!\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 77\nWYKE: BEGINS FITTING THE ITEM. A FEW CLICKS AND SCRAPES. THE\nDEVICE: POPS INTO PLACE. THE GENERATOR CONITNUES POWERING UP.\nDEVICE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 78\nADVANCED: ALIEN SHIP IN FLIGHT. SMALL CRAFT FOR A SMALL CREW.\nPHEENAN: Commencing final approach, sir. I’1l plot a landing course that avoids the debris and smoke from that blast.\nKHORBAL: Was that her? (BEAT) Explosions don’t really seem her style.\nPHEENAN: It could have been. Her tracer suggests she is close to the location of the explosion.\nKHORBAL: Is she... err...\nPHEENAN: Alive? Yes, sir. She’s moving away from the explosion location back towards the sphere.\nKHORBAL: Shame. Would have made things a little more... neat.\nPHEENAN: Sir?\nKHORBAL: Never mind. Take the ship down as soon as you’re ready — as close to the sphere as you can. We need to finish this.\nSHIP: FLIES PAST.\nSHIP: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 79\nFIRES: CRACKLE AND BURN. DEBRIS IS STILL FALLING.\nAMMAR: (CLEARLY CONCERNED. COUGHING) Constance? (BEAT) Constance! !\nFLORRIE: (COUGHING) Don’t worry Ammar, she’s fine. As am I — thank you for asking! (BEAT) We got her out just in time.\nCONSTANCE: (COMES ROUND ABRUPTLY. COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING) Ammar! Florrie!? (CATCHING HER BREATH) What on Earth? (SEES DESTRUCTION) What!? What happened?\nFLORRIE: You don’t remember? Ammar and I got to you just in time, moments before the charges went off.\nCONSTANCE: You did?\nAMMAR: You hit your head when we dived for cover. But you’re safe now. Come, we need to get back to the buggy.\nCONSTANCE: It was Yce. He led me here. He knocked me out. He tried to kill me!\nFLORRIE: I’m sorry, Constance. I should have stopped him sooner.\nCONSTANCE: What?! You knew... what he was planning?\nFLORRIE: Not quite. It’s complicated. Anyway — you have Ammar to thank. He alerted me.\nFLORRIE: THEY STOP.\nAMMAR: I was worried about you, Constance. I discovered Yce had taken explosives from storage, so I alerted Florrie. We found Yce’s\nAMMAR: buggy and observed from a distance. But we knew if I tried to\nAMMAR: stop Yce, he would have killed us.\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 80\nFLORRIE: Or at least, he’d have tried...\nAMMAR: We had to let him think he hadn’t been seen. I’m sorry!\nCONSTANCE: Sorry?! Ammar, I really couldn’t be more grateful. Thank you, both of you.\nAMMAR: (VERY EMBARRASSED) I couldn’t let anything happen to you, Constance.\nAWKWARD: SILENCE.\nCONSTANCE: Yes. Well, thank you. Really. I mean it. (BEAT) Anyway — what’s going on? What’s Yce playing at? And where’s the Doctor?\nFLORRIE: He’s in the Sphere with Wyke. Yce too, I expect. We have to get back there!\nFLORRIE: THE GALAXY 3 SHIP FLIES OVERHEAD DISRUPTING THE CONVERSATION. IT FADES AND HEADS IN TO LAND THROUGH:\nCONSTANCE: Gosh! Another spaceship?\nAMMAR: Strange...\nFLORRIE: (COVERING) Ah, I think Lyam mentioned some other visitors, so. Yes — it’s probably them.\nAMMAR: OK — let’s get back to the sphere. We’1l fill you in on what we know on the way, Constance! Some interesting information has come to light. We’ll take the buggy.\nAMMAR: RUSHES AROUND AND TRIES TO START THE BUGGY. IT FAILS TO\nFIRE: UP.\nFLORRIE: Yes, and I have a confession to make... but [let’s]!\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 81\nAMMAR: Dammit!! There is dust clogging the engines. From the explosion. It won’t start!\nCONSTANCE: Well, then — we’1ll have to walk back, I suppose.\nCONSTANCE: THEY HEAD FOR THE DOME THROUGH THE SAND.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 82\nMACHINERY: SOUNDS IN BETTER NICK NOW. POWERING UP MORE CLEANLY.\nWYKE: Very good, Doctor! Your assistance will not go unrewarded.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I require no reward. But I would like to understand a little more about what’s going on here...\nWYKE: Very well. Yce will benefit from a little education too, I think.\nYCE: PffffFfftt. If we must.\nYCE: INTO NARRATED FLASHBACK — ‘DREAMY’.\nWYKE: Three thousand years ago, I landed here in a colonisation pod.\nPOD: THUNDERS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND STRIKES THE GROUND ON TEYMAH.\nWYKE: It has always been the Ninexie way to launch these pods, and it is a noble thing to be chosen to travel and extend the Ninexie reach into the universe.\nWYKE: SOUNDS OF INTERSTELLAR WAR. LASER FIRE. SHIPS. EXPLOSIONS. SPARKS. LIGHTENING. HISSING. SCREAMING.\nWYKE: An attempted invasion and subsequent interstellar war led to a dramatic increase in our rate of emigration. (BEAT) After almost a hundred years in transit — my pod struck the surface of Teymah.\nPOD: FIRES THROUGH THE ATMSOPHERE AND HITS THE GROUND. AS THE SMOKE AND DEBRIS CLEARS, AND WITH THE PASSING OF TIME:\nTEYMAHRIANS: What is it? / A gift from the gods? / Don’t go near it! / Keep away! / Argh! It’s hot!! Hotter than the sun! / Get the master Shayman! / etc.\nTEYMAHRIANS: GATHER AROUND THE POD AS IT HISSES AND CRACKLES. AS IT OPENS THE NINEXIS ‘JUMPS’ OUT AND TAKES OVER ONE OF THE PEOPLE. OTHERS RUN IN FEAR.\nTEYMAHRIANS: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 83\nWYKE: I found a host upon landing, but the primitive people of this world had prophesised the arrival of a god... (SELF OBSESSED.\nHAMMILY: PUNCTUATED) I was that god!\nPRIMITIVE: CHANTING AROUND A FIRE. ANIMAL SKIN DRUM IN TIME.\nTEYMAHRIANS: Hah-va nay. Tey-ma ra. Hah-va nay. Tey-ma ra.\nWYKE: But our method of colonisation requires a certain level of technical and scientific ability on the part of the existing civilisation, but Teymah was too primitive. My only recourse was to use the Teymahrians as hosts, and attempt to accelerate their scientific development.\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 84\nFINAL: PART OF LANGING. LANDED AND POWERING DOWN.\nPHEENAN: Does this Ninexis know that its world has been destroyed?\nKOHRBAL: Extremely unlikely, but we can’t risk young ‘Florrie’ breaking the news to it.\nPHEENAN: What if she does?\nKOHRBAL: We have to make sure that, whatever happens — the Ninexis is destroyed.\nPHEENAN: How do we do that?\nKOHRBAL: Prime the ship’s self-destruct mechanism.\nPHEENAN: Sir?\nKOHRBAL: Just an insurance policy, Pheenan. Should we fail to destroy the Ninexis, or if it has already started reproducing then we destroy the ship — destroying the Ninexis sphere and any potential hosts for for more of them.\nPHEENAN: (PANICKED) Sir?!\nKOHRBAL: I thought you were dedicated to the cause, Pheenan?\nPHEENAN: I am, sir, but there must be nearly a hundred people at this Site — they’1ll all be killed.\nKOHRBAL: A small price to pay to complete our mission — wouldn’t you agree? (BEAT) Good — come along! Bring the remote, and the cage.\nPHEENAN: (SIGHS) Yes. Sir.\nPHEENAN: THEY EXIT.\nPHEENAN: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 85\nPHEENAN: THEY MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE SAND.\nCONSTANCE: But then this... creature... used its power to form a cult around itself? I saw some references to that in the temple inscriptions!\nAMMAR: That is what the legends appear to say.\nFLORRIE: It’s much more than a legend, Ammar.\nCONSTANCE: But then somehow this cult caused the extinction of the entire Teymahrian race? It seems a little unlikely.\nAMMAR: The Teyhmarian writings only go so far before mentions of the god and his cult begin to disappear, and then only the inscriptions remain — the ones you’ve been trying to translate.\nCONSTANCE: I see. And where do you come in to all this, Florrie? I’m none the wiser about you and your role.\nFLORRIE: There’s no easy way to say this, but I’m afraid I’ve been misleading you. I’m not just some gold digger — I’m a secret agent working for the Galaxy Three intelligence agency. I’ve been undercover for the last year, observing Yce.\nFLORRIE: AMMAR AND CONSTANCE STOP. FLORRIE TAKES THREE MORE STEPS.\nAMMAR: What?!\nCONSTANCE: Goodness me.\nFLORRIE: STOPS AND TURNS BACK TO THEM.\nFLORRIE: Sorry, Ammar. I hated lying to you. I know you’re one of the good guys... but I had my orders, and I couldn’t compromise my position.\nCONSTANCE: And what exactly is the purpose of your mission?\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 86\nWYKE: I made as much progress as I could, but Teymahrian physiology is weak... the bodies brittle and short-lived. As hosts they would only last days... sometimes only hours.\nTEYMAHRIAN: WOMAN DIES. NINEXIES LEAPS TO ANOTHER HOST.\nWYKE: I tried to complete my mission — to generate power to drive my own electromitosis, but this pathetic planet was too primitive. The people too backward and barbaric.\nWYKE: THE DOCTOR INTERRUPTS SNAPPING WYKE OUT OF FLASHBACK.\nDOCTOR: Barbaric?! Primitive? Who are you — or the Ninexie for that matter — to judge and destroy civilisations?\nWYKE: (ANGERED) I did not destroy them, Doctor. They destroyed themselves! The backward fools would no longer follow me. Would not assist me. It was only a matter of time until I had no more hosts.\nDOCTOR: You wiped out all of them? Single-handedly? Leaping from host to host... tens of millions of them, in order to allow your own procreation? Using them up as if they were disposable shells?\nWYKE: Their bodies were weak, and their minds even weaker.\nDOCTOR: But this is genocide — on the most obscene and monstrous scale. A single being wiping out an entire civilisation.\nWYKE: I was a god! I had absolute power over all my subjects! Over their lives... and deaths.\nYCE: And you will have that power again! We will have it again!\nDOCTOR: Yce! Listen to what Wyke is saying. All the things that happened to the ancient Teymahrians... it will happen all over again, unless we do something to stop it now.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 87\nYCE: Oh no, Doctor. I have too much invested in this. I will have what has been promised to me. And if you are not with us — then you are against us, and your body will make as good a host as any!\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 88\nYCE: AMMAR AND CONSTANCE RUN (QUICK JOG) BACK TOWARDS THE SPHERE.\nCONSTANCE: Are you telling me that Yce’s interest in the occult was sufficient to launch some kind of undercover investigation?\nFLORRIE: It was far more than that. Whatever he’d found here on Teymah, he didn’t want anyone else to get at it. He bought exclusive mining rights in perpetuity from the Ursa Aquarii senate, so we knew he was after something very special...\nAMMAR: Something that would give him more power than anyone else in the galaxy...\nFLORRIE: That’s what he seems to think.\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: So, with no more hosts, you were forced to return to your spore — the artefacts?\nWYKE: To lie dormant for two thousand years, while remaining conscious throughout.\nDOCTOR: Not much fun, I’1ll grant you. But you were so close! You managed to rally your cult into constructing this sphere as a means of your reproduction. So close... and yet so far!\nWYKE: Correct, Doctor. The most painful aspect of the entire process was the fact that I was mere days away from completing my mission... but with no more host bodies left; I was unable to reproduce. I saw no option but to make the inscriptions in the last days in my host body... it was too weak to do anything else. (BEAT) It was one of the most tortuous and dreadful decisions... to consign myself to a potential forever of loneliness...\nDOCTOR: In the hope that one day, someone would come to your rescue? (BEAT) And then... Mister Yce. Your white knight!\nWYKE: Indeed. So you see, Doctor — why there is no chance I will let anything stand in the way of my reproduction, and colonisation of this planet.\nDOCTOR: But there is another way. I can help you. You don’t need to stay trapped here! If you’1ll just let me deactivate the machinery —\nYCE: Grab him, Wyke!\nYCE: THE DOCTOR STRIDES FORWARDS TO DEACTIVATE THE MACHINERY, BUT IS\nGRABBED: BY WYKE.\nWYKE: (EFFORT) Leave the machinery be, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (MANHANDLED) There’s really no need for this. Either of you.\nWYKE: RELAXES HIS GRIP.\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR: Thank you! It’s rather uncomfortable when you do that, you know!\nYCE: Can we get on? I went to some considerable expense to get this all set up, and I’m eager to get my reward.\nDOCTOR: Yce! I really don’t think the reward you seek is what you will receive!!\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR: CONSTANCE, AMMAR AND FLORRIE ARRIVE AT THE TARDIS.\nAMMAR: This must be it. The Doctor’s ‘conveyance’.\nCONSTANCE: His TARDIS, yes. It doesn’t look like he’s here... What now? Does someone have a plan? Perhaps we should all go in to the Sphere to confront Yce.\nAMMAR: The Doctor asked us to bring you here. He said he had left you a message.\nCONSTANCE: Did he? Very well. (FX: PRODUCES KEY) Come on then, both of you.\nAMMAR: It looks a little small for three of us.\nFLORRIE: I’m going on to the Sphere. Now we’ve gathered enough evidence for a prosecution, I need to complete my mission — and arrest Yce.\nCONSTANCE: Single-handed? Is that a good idea?\nFLORRIE: Constance — as an agent of the Galaxy Three secret service, I trained for seven years in intergalactic espionage, hand-to- hand combat, [firearms handling]\nCONSTANCE: (INTERRUPTING) I’1l take your word for it.\nFLORRIE: If something should go wrong — it was a pleasure meeting you, Constance.\nFLORRIE: HEADS OFF.\nAMMAR: Good luck, Miss Solomon.\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENED.\nCONSTANCE: Come along, Ammar.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL)\nAMMAR: After you, dear Constance.\nCONSTANCE: Very well.\nTHEY ENTER. INTO: Page 92\nTHEY ENTER. INTO: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 93\nTHEY ENTER. INTO: CONSTANCE AND AMMAR ENTER.\nAMMAR: Ah! Eh? Whaaa?\nDOORS: CLOSE.\nCONSTANCE: I should have warned you. It’s bigger on the inside than one might expect. All rather strange, don’t ask me to explain. (BEAT) Now... (SEARCHING) Where’s this message?\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 94\nSPHERE: HUM BUILDING. LIGHT DUST STORM AGAIN. FLORRIE WALKS\nTOWARDS: IT AND STOPS TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT SHE IS ABOUT TO DO.\nFLORRIE: (SOTTO) A two year mission.. and here we are. At the final hurdle. I wonder how my [poor fiancé will react]\nSHE: IS DISTURBED BY TWO SETS OF HEAVY ALIEN FOOTSTEPS WHICH\nARRIVE: BEHIND HER AND SPINS AROUND.\nKOHRBAL: Agent Floranta!\nFLORRIE: Commander Kohrbal! (BEAT) Pheenan — I told you not to come here!\nPHEENAN: Sorry [Floranta]\nKOHRBAL: (INTERRUPTING) This was not Pheenan’s decision, or yours. Since you have so clearly failed the original mission, we were forced to intervene.\nFLORRIE: Everything is on track, Kohrbal. I told you I’d need more time!\nKOHRBAL: By the look and sound of this Ninexie sphere, agent, it looks like time is running out.\nFLORRIE: So, what are you going to do? Go in and blast everyone?\nKOHRBAL: You know me too well. You’ve failed to capture the primary Ninexis, and as you know only too well they are far too dangerous to be allowed to wonder freely.\nFLORRIE: So the only other option is to destroy it?\nKOHRBAL: Precisely.\nFLORRIE: No! If you do that, you’re no better than them! I won’t allow get\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 95\nSHE: BEGINS RUNNING TOWARDS TO THE SPHERE.\nKOHRBAL: How tiresome. (LOW EFFORT TO SHOUT AFTER HER) Stop! Immediately. (TO HIMSELF) Oh, what’s the use?\nKOHRBAL: DRAWS AN ENERGY WEAPON AND FIRES A SINGLE SHOT. FLORRIE IS HIT.\nFLORRIE: Ugh!\nSHE: COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND, HITTING IT HARD.\nPHEENAN: Sir! I could have just arrested her!\nKOHRBAL: Too risky. Capture allows for escape, whereas death? Death is more reliable. Come along Pheenan — time to end this.\nKOHRBAL: THEY HEAD TOWARDS THE SPHERE.\nKOHRBAL: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 96\nPOWER: CHARGING. ALMOST REACHED ITS PEAK.\nWYKE: Guard the Doctor, Yce. I must attend to the apparatus.\nYCE: RAISES A GUN. WYKE GOES TO ATTEND TO THE CHARGING DEVICE.\nYCE: Do stand still, Doctor. I really don’t want to have to shoot you.\nDOCTOR: I really don’t want you to, either. (BEAT) So, Wyke. Do tell me — what happens next? Electromitosis, I presume?\nWYKE: (SLIGHTLY DISTRACTED) As the primary Ninexis on this planet, this apparatus will allow for the generation of the necessary power for me to reproduce — by splitting my very being in two. Within days enough Ninexie will exist to begin colonisation... of this entire solar system.\nYCE: And beyond. In days, I’1ll own the galaxy!\nDOCTOR: I very much doubt that, Yce. I rather suspect that for you, the outcome all this will prove extremely disappointing.\nYCE: No, Doctor. I made a deal with the Ninexis. Unique access to Ninexie technology — to their unique ability! The commercial possibilities are endless. Living electricity — near-perpetual, self-generating — with a spark to catalyse things, and sentient too! Yes, it’s no exaggeration to say I’1ll be the most powerful man in the galaxy. No, no wait.. (BEAT) the universe!\nDOCTOR: Delusional. I knew you were power-mad Yce, but it’s even worse than that. The promise of absolute power — making you absolutely corrupt. (SOTTO) Hmmm. I might use that again one day.\nYCE: Tell him, Wyke! Tell him that I’m right, that this is all part of the plan!\nWYKE: (DISMISSIVE. PATRONISING) Yes, yes Yce. You are part of the plan. Don’t worry. You will not go unrewarded.\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: This is all very well in theory, Wyke. But you... your electroparasite.. left this planet dead and desolate... there is no population or civilisation for you to use as hosts, or to produce the power you need!\nWYKE: No matter. There are civilised planets nearby.\nDOCTOR: But at this very moment there is a mass evacuation taking place! You’1l have no means to travel anywhere!\nWYKE: Doctor, you present me with a problem, but also a solution.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nWYKE: Indeed. Once Yce becomes host to the next Ninexis, you will become a third host. Your conveyance will become our method of transport.\nDOCTOR: Oh. I wish I’d not said anything now.\nYCE: Hang on... host? Me? That was never the deal!\nYCE: THE POWER BUILDS TO THE FINAL PEAK.\nWYKE: Plans change, Yce. The Ninexie thank you for your assistance.\nSWITCH: FLIPPED. SPARKS FLY. YCE IS TAKEN OVER.\nYCE: AS THIS HAPPENS KOHRBAL AND PHEENAN ENTER. WEAPONS DRAWN AND\nPOWERED: UP.\nPHEENAN: Hands up, all of you.\nKHORBAL: Move and you’re dead.\nPOWER: CUTS. YCE COLLAPSES. SILENT.\nPOWER: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 98\nWYKE: Two more hosts? This is working out better than I could possibly have planned.\nDOCTOR: Who the devil are you? Get out now! Before it’s too late.\nKOHRBAL: Oh do be quiet, Sir. This is official business. (BEAT) Oh, dear. What a shame. Too late to arrest Mister Yce.. you creatures really are vile. Using and ditching host bodies. (BEAT) Pheenan — confirm electroparasitic status.\nPHEENAN: Confirmed sir — primary Ninexis is in this host body.\nDOCTOR: You know about these creatures?! Who are you?\nWYKE: Silence, Doctor! (BEAT) I sense... you’re from Galaxy Three.\nKOHRBAL: I see a couple of thousand years of isolation hasn’t dulled your senses.\nDOCTOR: Galaxy Three?! Of course!\nPHEENAN: You know of us?\nDOCTOR: Of course, of course, of course! (BEAT) How could I have not realised sooner! (BEAT) You’re from Wrechon Four, aren’t you? You fought the nine-hundred year war against the Ninexie!\nKOHRBAL: Very good, (REMEMBERING THE NAME) ‘Doctor’ — your knowledge of intergalactic history is impressive.\nWYKE: What do you know, Doctor? Enlighten us.\nDOCTOR: Of course — you’ve been here so long you won’t know be up to speed. I’m afraid that the warring civilisation you left... no longer exists.\nWYKE: What?!\nWYKE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR: And these two are here as part of the clean-up crew from the victorious planet — Wrechon Four. They are known throughout Galaxy Three... as the genocide squad.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 100\nCONSTANCE: MOVES DEFTLY AROUND THE CONSOLE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS.\nCONSTANCE: Terrible handwriting! Argh. You don’t make things easy do you dear Doctor? Can you read this Ammar?\nAMMAR: I can try! (TAKES PAPER) Errrr.\nCONSTANCE: Start at number nine. I’ve done the first eight.\nAMMAR: Alright. On the panel with the large... err, crystal? Use the bottom left blue controls to activate the telepathic extender.\nCONSTANCE: Done.\nAMMAR: Next connect the Heisenberg Focusing Device to to the extender system using the keypad below the monitor on the same panel in the following sequence... are you ready?\nCONSTANCE: Errr.. Yes! Ready. (BEAT) Thank you, Ammar. I couldn’t do this without you.\nAMMAR: Anything for you, Constance.\nAMMAR: AWKWARD.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, well... quite. (BEAT) Right! We’re almost ready for you Doctor... good luck, whatever it is that you’re up to. What’s the sequence?\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 101\nCONSTANCE: We’re almost ready for you Doctor... good luck, whatever it is\nCONSTANCE: that you’re up to.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Not yet, Constance... Wait!\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 102\nECHOING: THROUGH TARDIS, FROM PREVIOUS SCENE:\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Not yet, Constance... Wait!\nCONSTANCE: Something’s wrong...\nAMMAR: What do you mean? Did we skip a step in the instructions?\nCONSTANCE: No, no. I don’t mean it like that. I feel... anxious, frustrated... like something has wrong-footed me... or perhaps like another solution is in front of me?\nAMMAR: What has wrong-footed you? What solution?\nCONSTANCE: Well, no, not me — the Doctor. I’m not sure.\nAMMAR: The Doctor?!\nCONSTANCE: Don’t worry. It’s complicated. But something’s wrong — we need to go back outside.\nAMMAR: But the instructions specifically say...\nCONSTANCE: I know. But I get the feeling that even the Doctor didn’t anticipate whatever has happened here... Come on!\nTARDIS: DOORS OPEN. THEY EXIT.\nTARDIS: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 103\nTHINGS: ARE HEATING UP IN THE SPHERE.\nWYKE: My people are dead? My world... is dead?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nKOHRBAL: All very sad, but you can see, Doctor — how dangerous these Ninexie are? Believing it’s their right to destroy planets — to render whole species extinct?\nWYKE: And how is that any different to what you intend to do?\nDOCTOR: My thoughts precisely. What makes you think you have the right?\nKOHRBAL: The destruction of one species to save hundreds — or even thousands of others Doctor. How can you doubt it?\nDOCTOR: This is all sounding painfully familiar.\nKOHRBAL: I have full authority from the Galaxy Three parliamentary committee to imprison or kill anyone who stands in the way of our mission, Doctor. (BEAT) So, are you with us, or against us?\nDOCTOR: I’ve already heard that line today... it’s getting rather tiresome.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR: AMMAR AND CONSTANCE RUN TOWARDS THE SPHERE BUT SPOT FLORRIE\nFACE: DOWN IN THE DIRT.\nAMMAR: Constance! Over there!\nCONSTANCE: What is it Am[mar] (SPOTS FLORRIE) Oh goodness me!\nCONSTANCE: THEY RUN OVER TO THE BODY.\nAMMAR: (CROUCHING DOWN) Miss Florrie?! Are you alright?\nCONSTANCE: Don’t worry, we're here. What happened? Did you find the Doctor?\nFLORRIE: (NOT QUITE WITH IT) He shot me!\nAMMAR: Who?\nCONSTANCE: The Doctor shot you?!\nFLORRIE: No, no! My... boss...\nAMMAR: Yce?\nFLORRIE: (GETTING UP) No! Ugh. Thank goodness I was wearing this.\nSHE: UNBUCKLES A DEVICE AROUND HER WAIST AND STRIPS AWAY THE KIT\nTHROWING: IT ON THE GROUND\nCONSTANCE: What’s that? A belt?\nFLORRIE: A little side project of mine.. a Ninexis-resistant capacitor belt. It absorbed the shot from Khorbal’s weapon. But now it’s busted. Useless. (BEAT) Argh! This wasn’t supposed to happen.\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 105\nCONSTANCE: What wasn’t? Who’s Khorbal? This is all [very confusing]\nFLORRIE: Very confusing, yes, I’m sure. (DUSTING HERSELF DOWN) Look — we already know that we don’t have much time, and if I know Khorbal, then...\nAMMAR: Then what?\nFLORRIE: Quickly! We have to get to their ship. I’1ll explain the rest on the way!\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 106\nFLORRIE: AT THE START OF THIS SCENE YCE IS STARTING TO COME ROUND/BE\nREVIVED: BY HIS NINEXIS PARASITE.\nKOHRBAL: The choice is quite simple, Ninexis. Get into the cage.\nDOCTOR: What is that? Some sort of mobile prison?\nPHEENAN: Precisely, Doctor. An electrical cage designed specifically for the Ninexie. It can store up to six individual Ninexie for up to one hundred days without any chance of their escape.\nPHEENAN: HE PLACES THE CAGE ON THE FLOOR, POWERS UP AND OPENS THE SMALL CUBOID.\nDOCTOR: And after a hundred days?\nPHEENAN: The cage self-destructs — for safety purposes.\nKHORBAL: Get in the cage, Ninexis!\nWYKE: And if I refuse?\nKOHRBAL: Then I will simply destroy your host with this weapon.\nKOHRBAL: COCKS AND CHARGES WEAPON.\nPHEENAN: Please, Ninexis. Get in the cage.\nDOCTOR: You seem to have missed a rather obvious point here...\nKOHRBAL: And that is?\nYCE: (GETTING UP AND LUNGING TOWARDS KOHRBAL) There are two Ninexie here!\nYCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 107 THE TWO STRUGGLE. YCE SURGING WITH ENERGY. HE STRANGLES KHORBAL.\nPHEENAN: Stop! By the authority of Galaxy Three’s parliamentary— Oh, forget it.\nPHEENAN: COCKS HER WEAPON. FIRES. YCE IS HIT.\nYCE: Argh!\nYCE: IS DEAD AND ROLLS OFF KOHRBAL, WHO IS ALREADY MORTALLY WOUNDED.\nKOHRBAL: (STRUGGLING TO BREATHE) Thank you, Pheenan. Better late than\nKOHRBAL: never... We can’t take any more risks.\nPHEENAN: Please, Commander Kohrbal, sir... I don’t want to die.\nKOHRBAL: ACTIVATES THE REMOTE SELF-DESTRUCT TRIGGER.\nKOHRBAL: It’s done. I’m sorry, soldier. (DIES)\nKOHRBAL: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 108\nKOHRBAL: FLORRIE, CONSTANCE, AND AMMAR CRASH UP THE GANGWAY INTO THE\nSMALL: SHIP.\nCONSTANCE: We’re not going anywhere, are we?\nFLORRIE: Not if I can... (SEES PRIMED SELF-DESTRUCT) (FRUSTATED) Gah! No!\nAMMAR: Problem?\nCONSTANCE: They’ve primed the self-destruct mechanism.\nAMMAR: Then shouldn’t we get out of here?\nFLORRIE: Unless you have a way of getting us off the planet, then there’s no point.\nCONSTANCE: What?!\nFLORRIE: This ship isn’t just a ship...\nFLORRIE: THE SELF-DESTRUCT ACTIVATED.\nCOMPUTER: Ship self-destruct activated. Detonation in ninety seconds.\nCOMPUTER: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP FROM CHECKING BODIES) Yce and the Commander are dead. Still, I suppose it could have been worse.\nPHEENAN: It is worse.\nWYKE: You — the Commander’s underling. What did you mean, about not wanting to die?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I wondered that myself.\nPHEENAN: Our ship isn’t just a flight vessel. It’s a bomb. A category nine destruction rig. The Commander primed its self-destruct, as he died.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nPHEENAN: In just over sixty seconds’ time, it’1ll explode - taking half this planet with it!\nPHEENAN: END OF PART THREE\nPHEENAN: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 110"

And you think that I would allow you to trap us in a resistance cage and allow our life force to be drained away until we are effectively destroyed, or the cage itself self destructs?!\nDOCTOR: My intentions are purely [honourable]\nWYKE: Your intentions are irrelevant, Doctor. There’s only one way to ensure you don’t try to capture us in the cage!\nWYKE: PICKS UP KHORBAL’S BLASTER.\nDOCTOR: Shooting me won’t help you, Wyke!\nWYKE: No, but destroying that cage will.\nWYKE: HE FIRES.

You will make the ideal host.\nDOCTOR: I’m not known for my hospitality.

WYKE AND PHEENAN SLUMP TO THE FLOOR.\nWHISPERS: THE DOCTOR SLUMPS TO THE FLOOR. EXHAUSTED AND IN PAIN.\nFLORRIE: Doctor! What happened?\nDOCTOR: (PANTING. PAINED) I used a mobile electrotelepathic device to Siphon the Ninexie into a temporary holding cell, outside of the sphere. (RECOVERING SLIGHTLY) I must say, I think it worked rather well. Thank you for your timely intervention... but now we need to get back to my TARDIS.\nFLORRIE: Your blue box? What’s so special about it, anyway?\nDOCTOR: Lots of things, but that is where the Ninexie are being held! Come on!\nDOCTOR: THE EXIT AT SPEED.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 128\nSEMI: CONSTANT WHISPERS OF THE NINEXIE LEAK OUT OF THE CONSOLE.\nAMMAR: IS NERVOUSLY PACING.\nNINEXIE: We must escape / We shall not be contained / I have waited too long for this moment to be imprisoned again! / The Doctor will pay dearly for this!\nCONSTANCE: Ammar! Will you relax, please? Your pacing is giving me a headache. (BEAT) Come along, Doctor!\nCONSTANCE: A SMALL EXPLOSION FROM THE CONSOLE. AMMAR SCREAMS (IN QUITE A\nGIRLY: WAY). THE TARDIS MAKES A DAMAGED SOUNDING ALERT.\nAMMAR: What was that? What’s wrong?! Is the control ‘thing’ alright? Why is it sparking?!\nTARDIS: DOORS OPEN.\nAMMAR: (JUMPING AGAIN) Argh!\nAMMAR: DOCTOR AND FLORRIE ENTER.\nFLORRIE: I see what you mean, Doctor. (BEAT) Ammar! Constance!\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke, it is very very good to see you! And you Ammar!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor — something’s wrong with the console. What’s going on?\nANOTHER: EXPLOSION FROM THE CONSOLE.\nANOTHER: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 129\nANOTHER: INSIDE THE CONSOLE ITSELF. THREE NINEXIE ARE TRAPPED IN AN ELECTROCHRONOCAPACITOR. AS THEY TRY TO ESCAPE THE BUMP INTO THE WALLS AND ARE BOUNCED BACK. VOICES ARE MORE DISTORTED VERSIONS OF WYKE, PHEENAN, AND A NEW VOICE (THE THIRD NINEXIS).\nDELIVERIES: MORE HISSED/WHISPERED THAT BEFORE.\nDELIVERIES: WYKE-NINEXIS: What has happened?\nDELIVERIES: PHEENAN-NINEXIS: Are we in the resistance cage?\nTHIRD NINEXIS: No we are somewhere else. This machine cannot hold us! I can already feel it weakening!\nTHIRD NINEXIS: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 130\nTHIRD NINEXIS: AMMAR, CONSTANCE AND FLORRIE STAND BY AS THE DOCTOR BEGINS FIDDLING WITH THE CONSOLE. STILL WHISPERS — ECHOES FROM\nPREVIOUS: SCENES.\nAMMAR: These things are inside... this console?\nDOCTOR: In a manner of speaking. The Ninexie are prisoners inside the electrochronocapacitation system.\nANOTHER: SMALL POP OF EXPLOSION. FIZZING.\nDOCTOR: Don’t panic! If we just reroute a little power from the Vortex shields into the electrochronocapactiors...\nDOCTOR: TAPS IN SOME FINAL COMMANDS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE DISTRESS AND WHISPERS ARE SILENCED.\nDOCTOR: There! Much better.\nCONSTANCE: So what do we do now? What’s the next part of your plan?\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. That’s.. one small problem. I’ve not quite got to the next bit. (BEAT) Well done with disarming that bomb, by the way, Mrs Clarke. Most impressive!\nCONSTANCE: That was you, of course. Using that local telepathic device of yours?\nDOCTOR: Yes indeed! Thanks to my rather nifty mobile telepathic circuit extension, I was able to use the TARDIS’ telepathic circuits to contact you from inside the sphere. I had rather hoped that our friends from Galaxy Three had the situation under control — hence me asking you to wait. But then dear Khorbal armed the bomb in front of me. (BEAT) Of course, I had every confidence that you’d be able to cancel the self destruct.\nCONSTANCE: I’m glad you were so confident. I must admit — It was rather exciting. It was strange though, Doctor — from then on, I felt as if I knew what you were doing. What your plans were. What you hoped I’d do. Another effect of the mobile device?\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR: Indeed! The TARDIS is a very intuitive and powerful creature. Aren’t you [my dear?]\nDOCTOR: HE STOPS AS THE TARDIS CONSOLE ACTIVATES AND BEGINS MATERIALISATION.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, that’s not good. Not good at all.\nFLORRIE: What’s going on Doctor?\nDOCTOR: She’s dematerialising.\nCONSTANCE: Didn’t you do that?\nDOCTOR: No I did not!\nCONSTANCE: Could it be the Ninexie causing it?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. I need to (HE STARTS FRANTICALLY WORKING ON THE CONSOLE) try to... (HE SEES SOMETHING) Hang on a minute, old Girt\nAMMAR: We need to get out of here!\nAMMAR: RUSHES TO THE DOOR.\nCONSTANCE: No! Ammar. It’s alright!\nCONSTANCE: HE STOPS.\nCONSTANCE: It’s too late anyway — we’ve dematerialised.\nDOCTOR: (WORKING IT ALL OUT) Come on... Come on...\nFLORRIE: (NOTICING HADS INDICATOR) Doctor — what’s this that’s just lit up?\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: No, no, no! What are you doing old girl? No point in the HADS. The threat is within, not without.\nDOCTOR: HE FLICKS OFF THE HADS. A BEAT. HADS REACTIVATES.\nDOCTOR: (TO TARDIS) Now is not the time for an argument!\nDOCTOR: HE FLICKS IT OFF AGAIN.\nFLORRIE: Is he always like this?\nCONSTANCE: Frequently.\nHADS: FLICKS ON AGAIN.\nDOCTOR: Now look here... (REALISES) Hang on a minute! Hang on a minute! I think I know what you’re getting at, old girl.\nANOTHER: SMALL EXPLOSION ON THE CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got it!\nDOCTOR: HE BEGINS TO EXIT THE CONSOLE ROOM IN A HURRY.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? What’s the HADS, and exactly have you ‘got’?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK) I’1l explain on the way. I seem to be doing a lot of that today! Come on — all of you!\nALL: RUN OUT.\nALL: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 133\nSKIDDING: FEET AS THE FOUR ALL RUSH THROUGH THE CORRIDORS.\nTARDIS: JUDDERS AS IT STARTS TO SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF THE\nNINEXIE: BEING TRAPPED IN THE CONSOLE.\nCONSTANCE: Where are we going, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Power Room. Next left! (BEAT) I’m sure it used to be closer to the Control Room...\nAMMAR: How big is this place, anyway...?\nFLORRIE: What do we do once we’re there, Doctor?\nFLORRIE: THE SKID AROUND ANOTHER CORNER.\nDOCTOR: The old girl was trying to tell me something by activating the HADS...\nFLORRIE: The what?\nDOCTOR: HADS. Hostile Action Displacement System. When in danger — where the TARDIS is under threat, the HADS moves her out of that dangerous environment. (BEAT) Through here!\nCROSS FADE TO: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 134\nCROSS FADE TO: THE FOUR BURST THROUGH A DOOR INTO ANOTHER AREA.\nCONSTANCE: But the problem is inside the TARDIS, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nFLORRIE: I’m none the wiser.\nAMMAR: Nor me!\nDOCTOR: All will become clear! (BEAT) Possibly.\nDOCTOR: THE DISAPPEAR UP THE CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: THE ANGRY NINEXIE BEGIN TO DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THEIR\nPRISON: CELL.\nTHIRD NINEXIS: We are weakening the device!\nTHIRD NINEXIS: WYKE-NINEXIS: We must concentrate our efforts!\nTHIRD NINEXIS: PHEENAN-NINEXIS: Together then. NOW!\nTHIRD NINEXIS: THE BOUNCING AROUND INTENSIFIES AND ELECTRICAL FIELD BEGINS TO\nBREAK: DOWN.\nBREAK: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 136\nBREAK: THE ENTIRE TARDIS JUDDERS AND TILTS OVER TWENTY DEGREES CAUSING THE FOUR TO STUMBLE INTO THE WALL BEFORE IT RIGHTS. THE\nCLOISTER: BELL SOUNDS.\nCONSTANCE: /FLORRIE/DOCTOR/AMMAR: (THROWN TOWARDS THE WALL) Whooooaaahh! / Aaaah! / Oh dear!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry! Keep going!\nDOCTOR: THEY CONTINUE RUNNING.\nFLORRIE: It felt like we were about to capsize then... or whatever it is that happens to a TARDIS!\nAMMAR: (REALLY FRIGHTENED) What’s happening?!\nDOCTOR: The Ninexie must be doing some serious damage. Come on — we’re almost there!\nFLORRIE: How far?!\nDOCTOR: Second door on the right. Just ahead!\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR AND FLORRIE GO THROUGH THE DOOR. AMMAR IS PARALYSED WITH FEAR. CONSTANCE CLOSES IN TO COMFORT HIM.\nCONSTANCE: Ammar! Come on!\nAMMAR: I... I can’t!\nCONSTANCE: (INSISTENT BUT VERY WARM) Ammar. I know you can. You’ve already saved a life today. The Doctor knows what he’s doing, but he needs all of us to help. I know you can do it.\nAMMAR: (NEW SHAKY CONFIDENCE) Yes. You are right, Constance. Let’s go!\nAMMAR: AHEAD THE DOCTOR LEANS BACK INTO THE CORRIDOR AND CALLS BACK.\nDOCTOR: Constance! Ammar! Hurry!!\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR: THE TARDIS AGAIN SHAKES AND THE CLOISTER BELL SOUNDS — MORE\nDISTRESSED: THAN BEFORE.\nDISTRESSED: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 138\nDISTRESSED: THE POWER ROOM IS A HUGE CAVERNOUS ROOM. ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS HUM. TURBINES MOVING IN THE BACKGROUND? DEVICES SOUNDING IN RHYTHM WITH THE CONSOLE. OVER THIS — MUCH DISTRESSED MACHINERY,\nSPARKING: DEVICES, SMALL EXPLOSIONS. ALL A BIT OF A DISASTER ZONE. VERY LOUD!\nSPARKING: THEY RUSH IN AND COME TO A HALT.\nAMMAR: It’s huge! Vast!\nCONSTANCE: You’ve never shown me this place before, Doctor! It’s like a cathedral... an ugly industrial cathedral!\nFLORRIE: What do you need us to do, Doctor? Where are we headed? To the turbines?\nAMMAR: We don’t need to go up to those high walkways, do we? I’m really not good with heights!\nBREAKING: GLASS AS ONE OF THE FLUID LINKS SMASHES.\nDOCTOR: Oh no! The fluid links won’t take much more of this!\nFLORRIE: (INSISTENT) What do we need to do, Doctor?!\nDOCTOR: Alright. Everyone follow my instructions and we might make it out of this. (BEAT) (SEMI-SOTTO) Unless I’ve misunderstood the old girl, of course.\nANOTHER: CONDUIT EXPLODES.\nCONSTACE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Right. Florrie — those tubes — the fluid links?\nFLORRIE: These? (BEAT) Yep. What about them?\nDOCTOR: Each time there’s an overheat warning, use those controls to switch the link off and turn a backup link on.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 139\nFLORRIE: Alright.\nOVERHEAT: WARNING. FLORRIE REACTS AND SWITCHES THE FIRST ONE OFF.\nFLORRIE: Like that?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Constance, Ammar — come with me to the other side! (CALLING BACK) And if a link explodes — try not to breathe in the fumes!!\nDOCTOR: THEY RUN OFF.\nDOCTOR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR: THE NINEXIE WHISPERING BUILDS. MORE SMALL EXPLOSIONS. TIME\nROTOR: JUDDERS AND STRUGGLES TO CARRY ON. IT CAN’T GET MUCH\nWORSE: THAN THIS! MORE LAYERS OF WHISPER — NOW INDISTINCT/UNINTELLIGABLE. LAYER EARLIER WHISPERS. DISTORT. BUILD.\nWORSE: #219: ABSOLUTE\nWORSE: 89.\nPOWER: by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 141\nPOWER: CONSTANCE, AMMAR AND THE DOCTOR ARRIVE AT THE HADS POWER\nPOWER: TERMINAL.\nDOCTOR: Erm... right!\nDOCTOR: HE BEGINS FIDDLING WITH CONTROLS AND UNPLUGGING/REPLUGGING\nDOCTOR: CABLES.\nAMMAR: This all looks very complicated. Their must be thousands... no —\nAMMAR: hundreds of\nAMMAR: thousands of controls, buttons, switches... how are\nAMMAR: we ever going to [get out of this?]\nCONSTANCE: Ammar! Calm.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (THINKING AND WORKING) All we need to do is divert the HADS\nDOCTOR: control system to the electrochronocapacitation board.\nDOCTOR: That should switch them Ammar, grab\nDOCTOR: THE TWO RUN\nUNRAVELS: AS OF THEM.\nDOCTOR: Right. This there. Once solve it.\nAMMAR: Is it safe,\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, hope!\nAMMAR: No!\nDOCTOR: What?\nAMMAR: No way are you taking the dangerous one, Doctor. wrong, you need to be alive to make an alternative plan.\nAMMAR: do it. Constance — if these breakers switch off, back on. No matter how many times. Keep them on! that cable reel. (BEAT) Quickly, man!\nABOUT: TWENTY FEET. WE STAY WITH THEM. THE REEL THEY RUN. AS THEY ARRIVE A PANEL BLOWS OUT IN FRONT\nABOUT: is it, Ammar. You take this terminal and plug it in it’s in, I’ll insert this one, and that should\nABOUT: Doctor? It doesn’t look safe!\nABOUT: I’ll take the exposed one. It should be fine. I\nABOUT: If it goes\nABOUT: So I shall take the dangerous one.\nABOUT: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nAMMAR: Certain.\nDOCTOR: Very well.\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR ATTACHES THE FIRST TERMINAL. THE EXPLOSIONS AND\nJUDDERING: INTENSIFIES ONCE AGAIN.\nAMMAR: Ready?\nDOCTOR: Ready. (SHOUTS OUT) Ready everyone?\nDOCTOR: FLORRIE/AMMAR/CONSTANCE: Ready! / Yes! / Let’s do it! / Fine!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OUT) Hold tight! (BEAT) Good luck Ammar!\nAMMAR: Thank you. Three. Two. One.\nAMMAR: HE APPLIES THE TERMINAL. A SHOWER OF SPARKS. AMMAR IS THROWN BACKWARDS.\nCONSTANCE: Ammar! !\nFLORRIE: What’s happened?! Is he alright?!\nDOCTOR: (COAXING — URGENTLY) Now old girl! We’re ready!\nDOCTOR: DISRUPTION IN THE POWER ROOM BEGINS TO SYNCHRONISE WITH THE\nROTOR: AS THE HADS ACTIVATES. WHISPERS COME AND GO IN WAVES AS\nEVERYTHING: SYNCS UP. COMPRESSION OF THE WHISPERS. SOUNDS\nSUDDEN: SILENCE.\nSUDDEN: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 143\nSUDDEN: AS THE HADS ACTIVATES AN ELECTRICAL VACCUUM OPENS IN THE\nNINEXIE: PRISON CELL. ELECTRCIAL VERSION OF SPACECRAFT\nDEPRESSURISATION: (SIMILAR TO INITIAL IMPRISONMENT BUT HARSHER)\nDEPRESSURISATION: WYKE-NINEXIS: We’ve done it! We are free.\nDEPRESSURISATION: PHEENAN-NINEXIS: No! It’s a trap! We are being drawn out of the machine!\nTHIRD NINEXIS: Try to hold on, brothers!\nNINEXIE: (REMOVED) Argh! / Nooooooo! / We must not allow this!\nNINEXIE: THE NINEXIE WHISPER/SCREAM AS THE HADS EXTRACTS THEM FROM THE CONSOLE.\nNINEXIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 144\nNINEXIE: THE TARDIS MATERIALISES FLOATING IN SPACE.\nNINEXIE: WHISPERS FROM PREVIOUS SCENE BEGIN TO UNSYNC FROM THE\nMATERIALISATION: SOUND.\nMATERIALISATION: AS THEY BECOME SYNCOPATED A BOOM OF ENERGY AND A SOUND LIKE A\nHEAVILY: DISTORTED RUSH OF HAIR EJECTS THE NINEXIE.\nNINEXIE: Wait! / Noooo! / We have been released!\nNINEXIE: WYKE-NINEXIS: It is... our home! We are in orbit around our home! The Doctor has returned us!\nNINEXIE: We must get to the surface / Before our life-force is drained! / Quickly brothers!\nNINEXIE: EJECTED. WHISPERING FLY PAST. THEN ALL IS CALM.\nNINEXIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 145\nAMMAR: IS COMING ROUND AFTER BEING BRIEFLY ELECTROCUTED IN THE\nPOWER: ROOM. TO BEGIN WITH THE LINES ARE MUFFLED AND INDISTINCT.\nCONSTANCE: Put him down here. Use my coat to support his head. Here.\nCONSTANCE: THE DOCTOR AND FLORRIE PUT AMMAR DOWN ON THE CONSOLE ROOM FLOOR.\nCONSTANCE: DOCTOR/FLORRIE:\nFLORRIE: He’s breathing!\nCONSTANCE: Will he be alright Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He should be. He got a nasty shock.\nCONSTANCE: The hero of the hour.\nAMMAR: SITS UP WITH A START. CROSS TO REGULAR POV:\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 146\nAMMAR: (CATCHING HIS BREATH) Constance?! (BEAT) Did it work?! Am I really a hero?\nCONSTANCE: (CROUCHING DOWN) You were very brave, Ammar.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well done indeed, Ammar. Most impressive. (BEAT) Now, just a few things to check, and then I suppose we should get on our way!\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR BEGINS INPUTTING COMMANDS INTO THE CONSOLE.\nFLORRIE: Is the TARDIS alright, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Surprisingly well, despite her recent ordeal with the Ninexie.\nFLORRIE: But where are they? What happened to them?\nDOCTOR: OPENS THE SCANNER.\nCONSTANCE: What is that?\nAMMAR: A silver planet?\nDOCTOR: The Ninexie homeworld. Our three Ninexie friends have been delivered back home. A several millennia-long round trip for them.. and nothing to show for it! But on the plus side, we've essentially reintroduced an extinct species back to its homeworld... so I’1l1 chalk that up as a good deed for the day!\nFLORRIE: But won’t they just start their emigration programme all over again, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I shouldn’t think so! Would you be in a hurry to leave after what the primary Ninexis has experienced? Two thousand years of solitary confinement, and then being outwitted by a very bright and brave bunch of aliens?\nFLORRIE: I suppose So...\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR: I think they’1ll be far too busy repopulating their homeworld. And I have a feeling they’1ll be staying put for a good long while.\nDOCTOR: CLOSES THE SCANNER.\nCONSTANCE: What a relief. So, back to Teymah, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. I imagine Florrie will have to file a report, and Ammar... well, with Yce gone and his empire likely crumbling, you’1ll have to consider a change of career, I think!\nDOCTOR: CLUNK OF CONTROLS AS THE TARDIS DEMATERIALISES. CROSSFADE TO:\nDOCTOR: THE TARDIS MATERIALISES ON THE TEYMAH SURFACE. ONLY A LIGHT\nDUST: STORM IS BLOWING.\nDUST: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 148\nALL: IS QUIET IN THE CONSOLE ROOM.\nFLORRIE: Well, Doctor, Constance... it’s been... interesting! I shall have to file a report, but I’m not entirely sure that my superiors are going to believe it...\nDOCTOR: Which agency is it that you work for, Florrie?\nFLORRIE: Galaxy 3 — Gamma Gamma.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes. I may have had dealings with them before, or possibly will have done at some point. Just mention my name... they’1l understand, I’m sure.\nFLORRIE: I had no idea you were an ally of ours.\nDOCTOR: I said I’d had dealings. I didn’t say as an ally.\nCONSTANCE: Well, that’s awkward.\nFLORRIE: Indeed. I think I’d best be on my way. (BEAT) Ammar, I’11 need\nFLORRIE: to interview you, for my report.\nAMMAR: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Ammar, I'd like a word before you go.\nFLORRIE: I’ll see you in the main complex... the canteen?\nAMMAR: Of course.\nFLORRIE: LEAVES THE TARDIS.\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 149\nFLORRIE: AS FLORRIE EXITS — FOOTSTEPS CAN BE HEARD APPROACHING.\nFLORRIE: U.A.X.S #1: I say there! Excuse me!\nFLORRIE: Hello — can I help you?\nFLORRIE: U.A.X.S #2:\nFLORRIE: You most certainly can, young lady. We’re here from the Ursa Aquarii Xenoarcheological Society. I’m afraid our shuttle was delayed.\nFLORRIE: U.A.X.S #1: We're looking for Mister Yce and Professor Wyke...\nFLORRIE: Ah, yes! We’ve been expecting you. If you come with me, I’1l be able to explain everything. (BEAT). I think. (BEAT) This way!\nFLORRIE: THEY TRUDGE OFF THROUGH THE SAND.\nFLORRIE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: Well, Ammar, I must say — it’s been an absolute pleasure. You've shown great courage and no little resourcefulness. I know Mrs Clarke has enjoyed your company, too. And since it would seem that you find yourself at something of a loose end —\nCONSTANCE: (KNOWS WHAT’S HAPPENING) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: . I wondered if you’d care to join Mrs Clarke and I on our travels? I sense you’re made of the right stuff.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, I completely agree [but I don’t know if that’d be appropriate]\nAMMAR: (INTERRUPTING — SAVING CONSTANCE’S EMBARRASSMENT) I don’t think it’s a good idea, Doctor. But thank you for the offer. I’m flattered. Really, I am.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Shame. (BEAT) Well, then I suppose this is indeed goodbye. Thank you, Ammar.\nDOCTOR: THEY SHAKE HANDS.\nAMMAR: Thank you, Doctor. (BEAT) Constance — may I speak with you\nAMMAR: before we say goodbye? Privately?\nCONSTANCE: (UNSURE) I —\nAMMAR: Please.\nCONSTANCE: Of course. I’1ll walk you out.\nCONSTANCE: THE TWO WALK TO THE OPENING TARDIS DOORS.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 151\nTARDIS: DOOR CREAKS OPEN. AMMAR AND CONSTANCE STEP OUT. A VERY\nLIGHT: DUST STORM IS BLOWING.\nCONSTANCE: Ammar, [I’m sorry but]\nAMMAR: (INTERRUPTING) Constance. Please, let me speak. I confess, I lost in admiration of you... but you are married, of course.\nCONSTANCE: I am, yes.\nAMMAR: So it is best if I keep my feelings to myself.\nCONSTANCE: Ammar, you saved my life twice in a day, and likely saved countless more lives, also. You’re a very brave and very wonderful man. This may have been only a brief encounter, but promise I will never forget you.\nAMMAR: To not be forgotten. I should like that very much.\nCONSTANCE: Goodbye, Ammar.\nSHE: KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK. TARDIS DOOR CREAKS CLOSED. AS IT\nAMMAR: Goodbye to you too, Constance Clarke...\nAMMAR: am\nAMMAR: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 152\nAMMAR: TARDIS IN FLIGHT. CONSTANCE WALKS BACK UP TO CONSOLE (FROM DOOR) .\nDOCTOR: A shame that old Ammar didn’t feel inclined to join us on our travels. But one must always endeavour to accept rejection with good grace...\nCONSTANCE: He did.\nDOCTOR: Still: I must confess, I’m not used to being turned down quite so— (PENNY DROPS) Ah.\nCONSTANCE: ‘Ah’, indeed.\nAWKWARD: SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke, I don’t know about you, but I’ve got sand everywhere, and I mean everywhere. In my mouth, in my ears, up my nose. So what we need, I suggest, is to go somewhere where we can feel properly refreshed. (FX: BEGINS SETTING CONTROLS) A little bit wet, a little bit windy perhaps — but nonetheless, reasonably clement. And I know just the place...!\nCONSTANCE: London.\nDOCTOR: Good heavens, no. I was thinking the Blustery Moon of Thessalonia. By a strange quirk of cosmic chemistry, the rain of the Blustery Moon of Thessalonia tastes rather like a home- made lemonade...\nCONSTANCE: London, Doctor. London, back to the War.\nDOCTOR: (INNOCENT) Which watr...?\nCONSTANCE: My war, obviously. I made it clear I was not deserting when I left.\nCONSTANCE: #219: ABSOLUTE POWER by Jamie Anderson (FINAL) Page 153\nDOCTOR: Now look. I can’t claim to know much about the condition of the human heart, but let’s not be hasty, Const— Mrs Clarke. Ammar was a nice enough chap, of that I’ve no doubt, but no chap is worth losing one’s head over...\nCONSTANCE: I have not ‘lost my head’ over anyone. But wherever I go — be it Teymah, or Strellin, or this Blustery Moon of yours — I won’t ever be free, will I? Not until I know.\nDOCTOR: About Mister Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: About my husband. All that time, Yce was engaged to be married to a secret agent — a spy — and yet he never once suspected her. It makes one think, does it not?\nDOCTOR: I suppose it does.\nCONSTANCE: Now — I’m going to change back into my uniform. It’s time, I\nCONSTANCE: think, I resigned my commission.\nDOCTOR: From the Wrens?\nCONSTANCE: From this ship. From the TARDIS. — London, Doctor. P.D.Q.\nSHE: WALKS OFF.\nSHE: THE END"
