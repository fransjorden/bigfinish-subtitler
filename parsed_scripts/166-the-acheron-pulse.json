Er, Madam, you’re quite right to say we offworlders come in a wide variety of guises. A good point, well made. But let me reassure you that in this particular case I am indeed one of those you seek.\nOLERIK: You are?\nDOCTOR: Oh, absolutely, yes. Indisputably.\nOLERIK: Right.

From the outworlders.\nOLERIK: The clan-lords have been trumpeting about it for weeks, good to see they weren’t talking out of their hats.\nDOCTOR: A gift?\nOLERIK: A reward. To Cawdor for its Galdrium deposits.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 12\nDOCTOR: Ah, Galdrium, yes of course, quite a valuable commodity.\nATHRID: So the outworlders say. And in return, they offer all the tools and knowledge their Empire can provide. A ring of steel in the heavens, and a fiery carriage to bear our bravest there.\nOLERIK: You never stop, do you?\nDOCTOR: Or a space-station and a rocket, to put it less esoterically.\nATHRID: If you like.\nDOCTOR: And just so we’re all quite clear: which Empire is it again?\nATHRID: Which - ? The Drashani Empire.\nDOCTOR: (RUEFUL) It seems I’m not so far off course after all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: (FILLED WITH MIRRORS AND PRISMS.

THE BUSTLE OF TRADING. FARM ANIMALS BLEAT AND CLUCK. )\nDOCTOR: So this is Cawdor Castle, eh? Your world’s council seat?\nATHRID: Aye.\nDOCTOR: I can’t imagine you nomads have much to do with cosseted city folk.\nATHRID: They’ve got their uses.\nDOCTOR: Negotiating with off-world empires, for example?\nATHRID: The outworlders are in here somewhere. I shall find them, collect the ransom and return to my clan.\nDOCTOR: You want rid of me already? You really know how to flatter a chap, don’t you Athrid?\nATHRID: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Well, I am nonetheless grateful you got me away from that bloodthirsty wife of yours, I don’t think she had my best interests at heart.\nATHRID: She’s a fine woman.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure she is, I can’t have seen her best side, she must be terribly charming at dinner parties...\nATHRID: She won’t be happy if I come back empty handed.\nDOCTOR: And you won’t. If it’s the Gadarel Empire. There’s definitely a diplomatic party here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 15\nATHRID: One of their carriages flew overhead a few hours past. They are here.\nDOCTOR: To witness the inaugural voyage of their rocket to the space station, I assume. Which would mean they’1l be in the vicinity of mission control. Hmm... Why don’t we try down there?\nATHRID: (SNIFFS) That’s an old crypt.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But how many old crypts do you know with a wide array of parabolic reflecting aerials on the outside?\nATHRID: Para-what?\nDOCTOR: Just trust me on this one, will you, there’s a good fellow... I think this is where we’ll find your outworlders.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: (BUSTLING EFFICIENCY.

Athrid — please! Put your sword away! I do apologise for my friend, he skipped breakfast this morning, he’s not in the best of moods.\nASTRONAUT: Cawdor Control? What’s going on?\nTEESHA: Hold position, Pilum Alpha. Things are a bit confused down here.\nDOCTOR: I do apologise for the intrusion. An orbital spaceshot’s Mission-Control, eh? Deep beneath a medieval crypt... you think you’ve seen it all, then something like this comes along! Cawdor ground-crew, trained by Drashani engineers, I presume?\nBORITZ: Somebody get these two out of here!\nDOCTOR: I thought as much. Perhaps you’d be kind enough to inform the imperial delegation of our presence?\nBORITZ: Now listen, I’m Mission Controller Boritz, and I -\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 17\nDOCTOR: I will be welcome, I assure you.\nTEESHA: I’m calling security...\nATHRID: Doctor, you said —\nDOCTOR: Oh, if I must. Perhaps this will ease my passage...\nDOCTOR: (HE FUMBLES IN HIS POCKETS, PULLS SOMETHING OUT. PERHAPS A\nTWINKLY: SOUND EFFECT, JEWELLERY GLISTENING? )\nTEESHA: (GASPS) It’s beautiful!\nBORITZ: What’s - ?\nDOCTOR: The Royal Carcanet of the Drashani Empire, centrepiece of Aliona’s wedding jewellery. If you could tell the Drashani I have it, it might prove conducive.\nATHRID: You had that on you all the time? Dammit, Olerik was right, I should’ve robbed you and left you to the Dremareels.\nTEESHA: Shall I contact Chief Advocate Vincol, sir?\nBORITZ: Yes. This is above my pay grade.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 18\nCHENI: More wine, Advocate?\nVINCOL: Please.\nCHENTI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No thank you. You know, you look rather familiar to me, have we met?\nCHENT: I don’t think so. Wine, Mr Athrid?\nATHRID: Wine? The drink of effete scribblers, woman. A real man drinks ale. Vast foaming flagons of ale!\nCHENT: That’s a no then is it?\nATHRID: (BEAT) Actually, I will have another, this isn’t half bad. Particularly when served by such a dainty wench. Ha!\nCHENT: Oh, er... thank you...\nVINCOL: Really, does this... thing have to be here all the time?\nDOCTOR: Oh, apologies, Advocate Vincol. My, er, acquaintance isn’t used to high society. I’d say he’s barely aware of low society.\nVINCOL: Well, seeing as he’s at least partially responsible for the return of the Carcanet I suppose I can extend to him some hospitality. Tradition dictates its bearer be afforded all honour and respect.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 19\nATHRID: Good.\nDOCTOR: Then I’m glad I brought it.\nCHENT: It’s so beautiful. Poor Aliona must have looked an angel when she wore it.\nDOCTOR: (UNCONVINCED) If you say so. Vincol, the nomads tell me you’re negotiating with Cawdor’s Council for minerals. Galdrium, in particular. Is this true?\nVINCOL: We're offering a fair price. Exclusive mining rights in return for advanced technology and Imperial protection.\nATHRID: Keep your protection, we’ll settle for your toys and trinkets.\nDOCTOR: I imagine negotiations are going to fly by.\nVINCOL: We've gifted them the space-station, and the rocket. We’ve been training their astronauts and engineers for several months. They’re progressing centuries in the tiniest amount of time.\nDOCTOR: I know. And I’m not entirely sure I’m happy about that. Who’s ruling the Empire these days?\nVINCOL: (BEAT) Her most Royal Empress Cheni Gadarel.\nDOCTOR: Cheni Gadarel? Tuvold’s daughter?\nCHENT: Tuvold?\nVINCOL: Er, yes, she was crowned three decades ago. When she was little more than a baby.\nDOCTOR: So I’m here thirty years later than I’d intended. Could be worse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 20\nATHRID: More wine, girl!\nATHRID: (HE SWATS CHENI’S BEHIND. SHE YELPS. HER TRAY CRASHES, GLASS SHATTERS! )\nATHRID: Clumsy wench!\nCHENT: How dare -! Get off me! Vincol!\nVINCOL: What? Keep your hands off her. Qatreem Voss is my personal assistant!\nCHENT: Vincol!

Or my meson-bodkin will burn out your heart.\nATHRID: Are you mad? You’d go to war for a scivvy? Pity you’re about to die, outworlder, you’ve grit, I might’ve liked you.\nDOCTOR: Let’s all relax shall we? There are times I feel I’m the only civilised being left in this scruffy galaxy! Athrid, put the young lady down and apologise.\nATHRID: Hmmmph .\nVINCOL: He told you to apologise, barbarian!\nDOCTOR: That appears to be an electrical dagger, Athrid, retreat might be advantageous.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003)\nATHRID: (BEAT) Very well. I apologise.\nVINCOL: I should run you through for this!\nCHENI: Vincol, Vincol, it’s alright. I’m not hurt.\nVINCOL: But Qatreem —\nCHENT: (INSISTENT) I’m alright.\nVINCOL: As you wish.

Say what you like about the Drashani — when it comes to hardware, they know their\nTEESHA: Wait.\nBORITZ: What?\nTEESHA: Got a new reading. Some kind of energy pulse...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 23\nVINCOL: Cheni was crowned during the Succession of Blood.\nDOCTOR: The Succession of Blood, eh? An evocative epithet for such a messy episode, though undeniably apt. Do continue.\nVINCOL: When House Sorsha was wiped out and the heirs lost on Sharnax, the Empire almost tore itself apart in a mass of in-fighting.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes. I had intended to return rather earlier, but you know how things get in the way.\nVINCOL: But too many people wanted peace. They knew Kylo and Aliona had died pursuing that dream and didn’t want to grant the traitors victory. The saboteurs and murderers were rooted out and a truce was signed out of respect for the sacrifice.\nDOCTOR: Sacrifice? Yes. And so Cheni was made Empress?\nVINCOL: She was the sole heir of Gadarel. And she’s ruled ever since. She’s a noble monarch - compassionate and enlightened. The people adore her. But for the war, this would be a Golden Age.\nCHENT: (SOTTO) Your patriotism’s running away with you, Chief Advocate.\nATHRID: Hmmph. She sounds dull.\nDOCTOR: ‘But for the war?’ Forgive my pedantry, Vincol.. but if the clash between the Empire’s Great Houses ended thirty years ago - what war?\nVINCOL: (BEAT) I’m really not sure I should be telling you this, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Royal Carcanet, remember.\nATHRID: Honour and respect!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 24\nVINCOL: But you still haven’t explained your ownership of that. The Carcanet was thought lost with the late Princess’ galley many years ago. I’d love to know how it came to be in your possession.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, thereby hangs a tale, Chief Advocate, thereby hangs a tale. Sorry to say, I was present at the tragedy of Sharnax.\nVINCOL: But we thought everyone was lost, both on the galley and the rescue ship.\nDOCTOR: Indeed they were. Brave men and women all. I was the sole survivor. Before I departed, the late Ambassador Tuvold told me to take the Carcanet as a Royal Warranty. For when I stopped by the Empire again.\nCHENTI: You knew Tuvold?\nDOCTOR: Not well. Our companionship was regretfully brief. A fine man nonetheless, with great courage. He did a lot for peace that day, I promise you that.\nCHENI: He - ?\nVINCOL: (SHUSHING, LIGHTLY) Qatreem! Er, Doctor, as I say it is traditional the bearer of the Carcanet is afforded respect and honour within the Empire.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nVINCOL: But the Succession of Blood has long been a mystery to our people.\nDOCTOR: Really? But Tuvold said there’d be recordings on the shuttle. A black box of some sort —\nVINCOL: Nothing was recovered. The ship’s recorder was damaged by fire.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 25\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, that would make sense, I suppose.\nVINCOL: House Sorsha destroyed, House Gadarel triumphant, the heirs on both sides dead and the Carcanet missing. Now you tell me you were present when it occurred.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can see how that could be misinterpreted.\nVINCOL: How can I be certain you didn’t murder Kylo and Aliona then take her jewellery as payment?\nDOCTOR: What, and hang on to it for thirty years before turning up and waving it around at an inopportune moment? Oh, don’t be ridiculous Vincol, think about it! I can explain.\nVINCOL: You’d better.\nDUKHIN: Chief Advocate!\nCHENI: (STARTLED) Dukhin?\nVINCOL: May I introduce Dukhin Stubbs? One of my delegation’s Junior Consuls. (POINTED) A very Junior Consul. What are you -\nDUKHIN: Sorry to intrude, Advocate. There’s a problem.\nDOCTOR: What kind of problem?\nDUKHIN: I’ve come from Mission-Control. Something’s happening to the space-station!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: (TENSION’S HIGH. AN ELECTRONIC BACKGROUND HOWL, INCREASING IN PITCH. )\nTEESHA: Space-Station V-24? Can you hear me? What’s happening up there?\nASTRONAUT: Garvik here, Control! It’s on all our instruments, we can’t block the signal! Barzil and Tregol are down. You’ve gotta help!\nDOCTOR: Sorry we’re late. What have we missed?\nBORITZ: Something’s attacking the space-station.\nTEESHA: We thought it was a natural phenomenon at first. But it looks like an energy beam.\nDUKHIN: An energy beam? Advocate, do you think it’s - ?\nVINCOL: (URGENT) Quiet, Dukhin!\nTEESHA: Whatever it is, it’s affecting the crew. Five of them are down, we've no idea if they’re unconscious or dead.\nDOCTOR: You seem to know what you’re doing, young lady. What’s your name?\nTEESHA: Teesha.\nDOCTOR: Good to meet you, Teesha, let’s have a look at your readings.\nDOCTOR: (THE ELECTRONIC HOWL STEPS UP A NOTCH. EAR-PIERCING! THE DOCTOR\nTWIDDLES: CONTROLS. )\nDOCTOR: This equipment’s a bit primitive, isn’t it? Are you measuring radionuclides? Ah, here we are. (BEAT, THEN HORRIFIED) Oh.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 27\nASTRONAUT: Get us out of here!\nTEESHA: Can you save them? What do we do?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nDUKHIN: We can’t just let them die!\nDOCTOR: It’s too late. This radiation’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. Your astronauts are already lost.\nASTRONAUT: Control! Help us! Please!\nASTRONAUT: (THE ELECTRONIC HOWL INTENSFIES AGAIN. THE ASTRONAUT SCREAMS,\nDISTORTED: HORRIBLY. THEN HIS SCREAM STOPS DEAD. THE ELECTRONIC\nHOWL: CUTS OFF TOO. THERE’S A MOMENT OF SILENCE. )\nBORITZ: What was that? Someone, anyone - what just happened?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Whatever this beam is, it’s remarkably strong. (GASPS) It’s causing a temporal backwash! No wonder I didn’t land where I expected to. This thing’s powerful enough to knock my ship thirty years and seventy parsecs off course.\nTEESHA: (QUIET) And kill a dozen men.\nDOCTOR: That too, yes.\nBORITZ: (DEEP BREATH) Chief Advocate Vincol — on behalf of Cawdor’s High Council, I formally call upon the Drashani Empire to meet its treaty commitments and offer the protection you pledged our world.\nVINCOL: The - ? I’m sorry. That won’t be possible. The treaty’s revoked.\nDUKHIN: What? Sir! We can’t [just] —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 28\nBORITZ: That thing’s wiped out everyone on the space-station. Who knows what’s next?\nVINCOL: You have my sympathies, but it’s not our concern. Dukhin, find Qatreem - get her to the landing-site. We need to be in the warpstream, and heading for Gadarel Prime within the hour.\nBORITZ: You treacherous -\nVINCOL: We choose our battles, Mission-Controller. I’m sorry. If you knew what we know, you’d do the same. Take my guards, Dukhin. Keep Qatreem safe.\nDUKHIN: Sir!\nDUKHIN: We should tell them what they’re facing, sir.\nDOCTOR: What did he mean by that?\nVINCOL: Excuse me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 29\nDOCTOR: Advocate Vincol? What is it you’re not telling me?\nVINCOL: I’m busy, Doctor. I must supervise my delegation’s departure.\nDOCTOR: Whatever happened in orbit’s rattled you. Dukhin was about to say something back there. You stopped him. Why?\nVINCOL: It doesn’t matter. It wouldn’t make any difference now. Excuse me.\nDUKHIN: He’s afraid, Doctor. So am I. So’s every Drashani on Cawdor.\nVINCOL: I told you to escort Qatreem to the shuttle, Dukhin.\nDUKHIN: She’s safe. On her way to the landing-site with a contingent of Archers. You should tell him about the Wrath, sir.\nDOCTOR: The Wrath? Singular or plural? Abstract or concrete noun?\nVINCOL: One more word, Consul, I’1ll maroon you on this planet!\nDUKHIN: The Wrath are at war with us, Doctor. They want our Empire eradicated from the cosmos.\nVINCOL: Dukhin — get back to the shuttle! I’1l deal with you later.\nDUKHIN: No sir.\nVINCOL: No?\nDUKHIN: They have to know what’s happening. If I can’t tell them while you’re here, I’1l have to stay behind when you’re gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 30\nVINCOL: You’re a junior diplomatic Consul, Dukhin. A nobody. Don’t throw your life away on a gesture.\nDUKHIN: It’s my decision, sir. Please convey my regrets to Qatreem when you’re clear, I’m sorry I failed her.\nVINCOL: You - gah!\nDOCTOR: That was brave.\nDUKHIN: Or stupid. Come on. I’11 tell you what I know of the Wrath. And the Acheron Pulse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 31\nWRATH: Drashani shuttle leaving Cawdor, Lord Deliverer.\nTENEBRIS: Fleeing to their homeworld. Prepare an attack squadron. Hold until they rendezvous with their starcruiser. Then run them to ground.\nWRATH: Tenebris be praised.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 32\nDOCTOR: Quiet down everyone! Quiet down! Junior Consul Dukhin has something to say. I’m afraid it isn’t good news.\nDUKHIN: Um. Hello everyone.\nDOCTOR: Take it slowly, eh? One thing at time. Start with the energy that blasted the space-station.\nDUKHIN: Yes... we’ve seen it before. The Drashani Empire, I mean. We call it the Acheron Pulse. It’s a psychic weapon.\nATHRID: A weapon? Cawdor’s under attack?\nDUKHIN: The Pulse is controlled by a race we know only as the Wrath. They’re led by a masked warlord — Tenebris. They first struck five years ago, we don’t know where they came from, it’s said they were oppressed and butchered by the Empire. Now they want revenge.\nBORITZ: Well, good luck to ‘em. What’s it got to do with us?\nDUKHIN: They’re carving through Drashani space, making for our capital. You're in their way.\nBORITZ: How can we fight them?\nDUKHIN: You can’t. We brought this on you. I’m sorry...\nTEESHA: Sorry? You’re sorry?\nDOCTOR: That’s enough Dukhin. You can sit down now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 33\nATHRID: If a storm looms, I must return to my clan. The nomads will gather! We will sing songs of war!\nDUKHIN: You'll die. You’1ll all die.\nATHRID: Nonsense! The Tar’khut are the fiercest warriors on —\nDOCTOR: - Cawdor. Yes, no doubt you are. But the foe you face isn’t from Cawdor. Dukhin’s right.\nBORITZ: What should we do?\nDOCTOR: If the Drashani and their technology were still here you might have put up a struggle, but from what I’ve seen your swords and bows are going to be next to useless. I’d advise surrender.\nATHRID: Surrender? Pah! You tremble like a shorn storbuck calf. The wolves of Tar’khut do not yield! (HE GETS UP, KNOCKING OVER HIS CHAIR) While you politicians cower, my clan will prepare for battle! Out of my way!\nDOCTOR: I was afraid he’d do that... Boritz, get your mission control team out of here. If the Wrath hate the Drashani as much as Dukhin says, they might be viewed as collaborators and we wouldn’t want that.\nBORITZ: Alright.\nDOCTOR: But if you and Teesha could stay behind, I’d be terribly grateful, I think I’m going to need all the help I can get.\nTEESHA: Understood.\nDOCTOR: The rest of you... offer as little resistance as you can, do nothing to provoke them. You’re not their target here, remember that. It’s the only chance we've got.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 34\nCHENT: Cawdor’s so tiny from this distance. So vulnerable. You might almost believe it doesn’t matter. Almost.\nVINCOL: They might survive, your Highness. If they don’t resist. The Wrath aren’t interested in Cawdor. We’re the ones they hate.\nCHENT: Perhaps. But we shouldn’t have abandoned them.\nVINCOL: I did what I had to do.\nCHENT: Do you know where Dukhin is? I haven’t seen him since we launched.\nVINCOL: He chose to remain on Cawdor, your Highness. He asked me to pass on his regrets, I’m afraid it slipped my mind.\nCHENT: He stayed? How very noble. Brings to mind the bravery of Kylo himself, don’t you think?\nVINCOL: If you say so, Ma’am.\nCHENT: What are those lights?\nVINCOL: Lights, Ma’am?\nCHENT: Those tiny lights, among the stars. They’re getting closer.\nVINCOL: Oh no.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 35\nBORITZ: How close are the Wrath?\nTEESHA: Advance vessels at 30,000 kilometers.\nDUKHIN: That’s the range limit of the Acheron Pulse.\nDOCTOR: And their troop transports?\nTEESHA: Moving in formation. Looks like they’re going to land.\nDUKHIN: They’1l occupy the planet. Make Cawdor a staging post for their invasion of the Inner Worlds — taking them less than sixty parsecs from Gadarel Prime.\nBORITZ: My heart bleeds for you.\nDOCTOR: What are those?\nBORITZ: What are what?\nTEESHA: I see them. Smaller than the main fleet.\nDOCTOR: A squadron of fighters, maybe some boarding pods. They’re on another heading.\nTEESHA: They’re after something.\nDOCTOR: That single space vessel. There, you see? It’s trying to outrun them, but they’re faster. They’re nearly on it.\nDUKHIN: No! It’s the Drashani starcruiser!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE SHIP’S UNDER ATTACK! ENERGY WEAPONS THUD AGAINST THE HULL! A DOOR SWOOSHES OPEN. )\nCHENT: Chief Advocate!\nVINCOL: We’re under attack, Ma’am. It’s the Wrath. Shields are down to residual power. You’ve got to come with me.\nCHENT: We should go the Flight Deck. Be with the crew. They need to know we’re standing [by them] —\nVINCOL: Boarding pods, Ma’am! They’ve breached the hull! Come with me!\nVINCOL: HURRY!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 37\nDUKHIN: We have to help them, Doctor! You’ve a ship, you said?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDUKHIN: We've got to get the diplomatic delegation to safety!\nBORITZ: Yeah, right. Save them and forget us!\nDUKHIN: You don’t understand. You don’t know why they left.\nBORITZ: They’re cowards, that’s why!\nDUKHIN: No! The Empire protects its subjects. We’d have laid down our lives for Cawdor!\nTEESHA: Well, then why - ?\nDUKHIN: Vincol had a higher priority. Our Empress — Cheni Gadarel.\nDOCTOR: Cheni? What about her?\nDUKHIN: She’s with the delegation — she wanted to attend the negotiations incognito.\nDOCTOR: She - ? Of course. Qatreem Voss. Suddenly that altercation with Athrid makes a lot more sense. I thought she looked familiar, it’s a family resemblance, she takes after her cousin!\nDUKHIN: Doctor, please!\nDOCTOR: Alright.\nTEESHA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 38\nDOCTOR: I made a promise, Teesha. A vow to a dying man. He wanted me to protect his daughter and I have rather failed in my duty until now. I think I may have to mount a rescue attempt.\nBORITZ: A rescue. With just four of us?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Is that a problem?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: (VINCOL AND CHENI CLATTER ACROSS THE METALLIC DECK.

AND THE BUZZ OF THE WRATH’S\nGESTALT: MIND. )\nWRATH: (ANNOUNCEMENT) Citizens of Cawdor Castle, we are the Wrath! Your world is now under our control. There is no cause for alarm. Our war is with the Drashani Empire. You are not our enemies.\nWRATH: We have identified Drashani sympathizers and other insurgents in this courtyard. They will be dealt with. If in proximity to an insurgent, remain calm and divert your gaze. Direct viewing may cause some retinal damage.\nWRATH: Kill them.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 42\nTEESHA: There’s Wrath landings all over Cawdor, Doctor. They’re occupying every population centre.\nDOCTOR: And the attack squadron?\nTEESHA: It’s moving off. It’s left the Drashani starcruiser for dead.\nDOCTOR: Map their trajectory. If they’ve taken prisoners we need to find out where they’re going.\nTEESHA: I’ll do my best.\nBORITZ: I’m glad to see you’re so concerned for the Drashani. Pity you didn’t care when our astronauts were killed and the Wrath landed.\nDOCTOR: I’m trying to get as many of us through this as I can, Boritz.\nDUKHIN: You said you made a promise, Doctor - to a dying man?\nDOCTOR: I did, yes. To Ambassador Tuvold.\nDUKHIN: Tuvold? Father of the Empress?\nDOCTOR: It was his last wish. I was to keep an eye on his daughter and the Empire. I’ve been lax in fulfilling my obligations, I had thought to pass by and make amends, but the Acheron Pulse knocked me off course. I’ve arrived a little too late.\nDUKHIN: I don’t understand. You were there? At the Succession of Blood?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 43\nDOCTOR: I was.\nDUKHIN: But you’re not old enough.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m older than I look, young man. I had a very different face then.\nBORITZ: Sorry, you’ve lost me.\nTEESHA: What’s the Succession of Blood?\nDUKHIN: Our Empire’s greatest tragedy. Thirty years ago we were at war with ourselves, two families vying for the throne. Aliona of House Gadarel and Prince Kylo of House Sorsha were to be married, in the hope their union would bring peace. But on the eve of the wedding they were assassinated and House Sorsha was massacred by traitors.\nDOCTOR: (AWKWARD) Yes. Well, that’s not exactly how it happened.\nDUKHIN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Well -\nTEESHA: Doctor. We’ve got the attack squadron’s trajectory... they’re heading for the space station.\nDOCTOR: Then if we’re to rescue the Empress, that’s where we’ll find her.\nDOCTOR: (WRATH ENTER -—- MARCHING IN PERFECT UNISON. BORITZ, TEESHA AND\nDUKHIN: REACT)\nWRATH: By order of Lord Deliverer Tenebris, you are prisoners of the Wrath. You will not resist.\nDOCTOR: Now, don’t panic. Just do as our militaristic friends say.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: (CURIOUS) Regimented, featureless, identical. Could be a clone race. But you’re not, are you? You’re something different. Inside that gestalt mind of yours, there’s an inferno of rage boiling away.\nWRATH: You will be silent! Disobey and you will die. Drashani sympathizers and insurgents will die.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well. We’re certainly nothing of that kind.\nWRATH: One of you is a Drashani. He will be dealt with.\nDUKHIN: (NERVOUS) Doctor... I think he means me...\nDOCTOR: Wrath - listen. This man’s no threat to you. You don’t have to hurt him.\nWRATH: Remain calm and divert your gaze while we execute the Drashani. Direct viewing may cause some retinal damage.\nTEESHA: Doctor! Don’t let them kill him!\nDUKHIN: Help me Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Stop this now!\nATHRID: (A COUPLE OF FLAMEBOLTS. A SHORT, BRUTAL CLASH. BODIES HIT THE FLAGSTONES, THE WRATH GESTALT IS SILENCED. )\nATHRID: I told you, Doctor. These outworlders are not so fearsome.\nDOCTOR: Athrid, thank you, your timing was immaculate. I thought you’d gone?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 45\nATHRID: Why would I? With cheap ale in the courtyard and messengers waiting for coin. One of them can call my clan here, I needn’t travel.\nDOCTOR: I suppose not. Dukhin? Are you alright?\nDUKHIN: Er... I think so.\nDOCTOR: Good. Athrid — we’re leaving Cawdor Castle. We’d certainly appreciate your sword at our side. Will you join us?\nATHRID: I’1l join you, if we can leave.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nATHRID: The mother of my brood should have arrived outside but it seems the gates are barred. There are too many of these creatures to get past - even for a warrior of the Tar’khut.\nTEESHA: We’re trapped?\nBORITZ: No. No, there might be another way.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nBORITZ: These catacombs, Doctor. They’re under every inch of the Castle. Some of the tunnels must lead outside.\nDOCTOR: A fair point. Well, don’t just stand there then. Lead on. Chop chop, there’s a good chap!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 46\nVINCOL: Ah!\nCHENTI: Vincol! You’re awake.\nVINCOL: I... oh my... where am I?\nCHENT: Some kind of cell. They brought us here after they broke in. For a moment there I thought you were dead.\nVINCOL: For a moment there, so did I. Well, we’re not, that’s a start. When their leader arrives, I'll talk with him. Negotiate terms for your release.\nCHENT: I don’t think it’ll be that simple. When we first heard about the Wrath, I imagined they were primitive savages. But they’re not. They have a purpose.\nVINCOL: A purpose?\nCHENI: I was wrong, Vincol. We were all wrong. These Wrath will tear out the heart of our Empire. And we don’t even know why.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 47\nOLERIK: I don’t believe it. The Clans of the Steppe call a council of war, something that hasn’t happened for two hundred years and you tell me you’re about to prance off on some suicide mission. You’re a total idiot Athrid.\nATHRID: I leave the Tar’khut in your charge, mother of my brood. Lead them to the gathering — await word of my victory. The Doctor and I have a destiny among the stars!\nOLERIK: A destiny among the - ? You are so predictable. He’s wrapping you round his little finger, you know that?\nDOCTOR: Oh, not at all, dear lady, not at all. I simply explained to Athrid that the leader of the Wrath, this Tenebris fellow, has no interest in Cawdor. He only cares about his Drashani prisoners.\nATHRID: So where else would he go, but the space-station where they are held? Should a man wish to be celebrated as the hero who saved Cawdor, he must go there too. A chance to face the invaders’ warlord in single combat! How could I refuse?\nOLERIK: You’ve a one-track flamin’ mind.\nATHRID: For the Tar’khut, blood and glory are prized above all!\nOLERIK: I know. That’s why we spend our nights freezing in flamin’ tents.\nATHRID: You go too far, mother of my brood!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps you two could continue this fascinating debate another time? I think I see my TARDIS parked up ahead.\nOLERIK: (UNIMPRESSED) That’s your ship?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 48\nATHRID: I’1l recruit a few likely lads to join us, Doctor. We will face down the Wraths’ legions — or die in the attempt! (SHOUTS) There will be blood! There will be glory! There will be songs sung of this day!\nDOCTOR: I sincerely hope they won’t be dirges.\nATHRID: Ha! I like you, Doctor — you have a mordant wit. (SLAPS HIM ON THE BACK)\nDOCTOR: Ooof!\nOLERIK: (SINCERE) Bring him back safely, Doctor. For me.\nDOCTOR: I’1l do my best, Olerik. I promise.\nDUKHIN: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Oh, Dukhin, hello.\nDUKHIN: Doctor, in Mission Control... you said the Succession didn’t happen the way I thought. We were told when Aliona’s wedding galley crashed on Sharnax she and Kylo were killed in the escape attempt.\nDOCTOR: Well, that much is true, certainly.\nDUKHIN: Two lovers lost to the Igris.\nDOCTOR: Those poor creatures, no, not quite.\nDUKHIN: So what happened?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 49\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Aliona murdered Kylo, Dukhin. Chopped off his hand and threw him out of an airlock to plummet to his death. One of the most abhorrent acts of evil I’ve ever had the misfortune to witness.\nDUKHIN: No.\nDOCTOR: She also ordered the assassination of the entire Royal Family of Sorsha.\nDUKHIN: But... but we sing songs of her. Tell stories. The great doomed romance.\nDOCTOR: There were no witnesses, no survivors, bar me, in such circumstances myths have a habit of developing. (BEAT) I’m sorry, Dukhin. I imagine it’s quite a shock.\nDUKHIN: To put it mildly.\nDOCTOR: Well, I fear you’1ll have to deal with it later. Round up Boritz and Teesha - we leave in ten minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: (TARDIS MATERIALISES. DOOR OPENS. THE DOCTOR EMERGES ONTO THE SPACE-STATION’S METAL DECK. )\nDOCTOR: End of the line! Everybody out!\nDOCTOR: (THE OTHERS EMERGE. INCLUDING HALF A DOZEN NOMADS - ARMOUR CLANKING. )\nTEESHA: Amazing!\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s nothing really. Simple transcendental physics and a dematerialisation circuit linked to relative dimensions.\nTEESHA: Not that. That’s just a box that’s bigger on the inside. I mean this place! Look at it!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, I suppose it would be impressive to someone whose race’s greatest technical innovation is the spiral staircase.\nTEESHA: Doctor — you don’t know what it’s like to look up at the stars from an ignorant world. This is what I’ve dreamed of since I was a girl. A proper space station.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, my dear, the Drashani didn’t exactly push the boat out when they gave you this heap. ‘Space-Station V-24'’ indeed! Hardly a name redolent of the mysteries of the cosmos. (BEAT) Is that everyone? Good. Let’s be on our way.\nBORITZ: Are we safe here? The Wrath are using this place as a prison. Prisons have guards.\nDOCTOR: We’re hardly unprotected, Boritz. Athrid’s warriors brought enough armour and weapons to sink a battleship.\nATHRID: (ARMOUR CLANKING) The wolves of Tar’khut will defend your trembling hides. But we are restless — our blades hunger for blood.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 51\nDOCTOR: Let’s keep that to a minimum, shall we? Come on. If we’re to find the Empress, we need to reach the station’s inner hub, that’s where she’ll be. It’s this way...\nDUKHIN: (WHISPERS, URGENT) Everyone — shush!\nATHRID: (LOUD) Hold fast!\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nDUKHIN: Round the next corner. Don’t you hear it?\nTEESHA: Animals. Lots of animals.\nDUKHIN: They’re not animals. They’re Igris.\nDUKHIN: (A FEW YARDS AHEAD: ELEVEN IGRIS — HUGE FERAL CREATURES — GROWL AND PACE FREELY )\nDOCTOR: Igris! Run!\nATHRID: What? What are you talking about!\nDOCTOR: Don’t stand there, just run!\nATHRID: Pah! Run from mere animals! If this is the route we should take, my wolves of Tar’khut will clear a path through these creatures!\nDOCTOR: Athrid! You can’t imagine how dangerous those things are!\nATHRID: Follow me, men! Let’s carve the bones of these gargantuan beasts!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 52\nDOCTOR: Athrid — NO!\nDOCTOR: (ATHRID’S WARRIORS CHARGE — ROARING WITH BERSERKER FURY! THE\nIGRIS: SEE THEM AND ROAR BACK! THEY CLASH! )\nATHRID: Feel my sword you — agh — agh!\nTEESHA: Athrid!\nDOCTOR: He’s dead.\nDUKHIN: They’ve got our scent!\nDOCTOR: This way, come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE NOMADS’ HORSES TROT. OLERIK STOPS, THE OTHERS FOLLOW HER LEAD. )\nOLERIK: Woah! We’ll make camp here. It’s a long ride through the mountains, we’ll — (SHE GASPS)\nNOMAD: Olerik! Are you in pain? (PANIC) Are you with child?\nOLERIK: (TEETH GRITTED) At my age? Don’t be ridiculous.\nNOMAD: What’s wrong?\nOLERIK: (GASPS) The father of my brood is dead. I felt his heart stop beating as surely as I’d feel my own.\nNOMAD: No! Athrid will return with the severed head of the invaders’ chieftain! He shall —\nOLERIK: He’s not coming back. The clan’s future’s on my shoulders now. Well, I won’t be found wanting. (DETERMINED) This ain’t the time for councils, my clan-brothers! Tomorrow, we return to Cawdor Castle. And war!\nNOMADS: WAR!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 54\nDOCTOR: This door’s jammed! Teesha, Dukhin - help me!\nDOCTOR: (MORE BANGING. DOOR SWINGS OPEN, HYDRAULICS HISSING. THE DOCTOR, DUKHIN AND TEESHA FALL INTO THE ROOM. HOWLS OF WILD\nIGRIS: ARE CLOSE BEHIND! )\nDUKHIN: They’re almost on us!\nDOCTOR: Boritz! Hurry up man! Get inside!\nDOCTOR: (BORITZ JUMPS THROUGH THE DOOR. ANOTHER HISS OF HYDRAULICS, AS IT SLAMS CLOSED. MOMENTS LATER, IGRIS BANG AGAINST IT USELESSLY. )\nTEESHA: You think that door’1ll hold them?\nDOCTOR: Looks like it. At least the Drashani have learnt from their mistakes there.\nTEESHA: What are those things?\nDOCTOR: The Igris? A slave-race. The Drashani Empire uses them for construction, terraforming.. other dangerous physical labour.\nBORITZ: And mining? You brought them to Cawdor to mine our Galdrium?\nDUKHIN: Um. Yes. But we were keeping them confined, I don’t see how they could get free...\nBORITZ: Caged ‘til you had your treaty signed. In case seeing those... things made the High Council reconsider selling out to you.\nTEESHA: Did you see what they did? They ripped Athrid and his nomads to pieces.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 55\nBORITZ: I hit one right between the eyes with this crossbow, it didn’t even blink!\nDUKHIN: This shouldn’t be happening.\nDOCTOR: I beg to differ. In my experience, this kind of thing is par for the course where the Igris are concerned.\nDUKHIN: Yes we've had trouble with them in the past. Rebellions when they were angered. But we found a solution.\nDOCTOR: What solution?\nDUKHIN: Punishment collars. They get a psychic shock if they harm a Drashani.\nDOCTOR: That’s barbaric.\nBORITZ: Maybe you’d rather they killed us all!\nDOCTOR: I don’t know how you’ve missed it, but that’s precisely what they’re trying to do!\nTEESHA: Those Igris weren’t wearing collars.\nDUKHIN: No. And there’s something else.\nDOCTOR: Well, don’t keep us in suspense.\nDUKHIN: We only brought three from Gadarel Prime. An advance contingent. There were more than three out there.\nDOCTOR: (PONDERING) Eleven. There were eleven Igris. One short of a\nDOCTOR: dozen...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003)\nDOCTOR: Please tell me that was my imagination.\nTEESHA: Page 56\nTEESHA: One of them must have been in here when we locked the door.\nDOCTOR: There — behind the pipes!\nDUKHIN: Emperor’s blood...!\nBORITZ: Help me load this crossbow!\nBORITZ: (THE IGRIS ROARS!\nBORITZ: IT CRASHES THROUGH THE PIPES,\nSTEAM: SPRAYS!)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 57\nWRATH: The Drashani vessel’s power-core has been retrieved, Lord Deliverer Tenebris. It will be brought to the flagship.\nTENEBRIS: Excellent. When it arrives, disconnect the Pulse batteries. Replace them with the Praxis Valve.\nWRATH: There is an intrusion alert on the space-station. Evaluating. (BEAT) Location: engineering deck.\nTENEBRIS: Find them. Incarcerate them, until the modifications to the Pulse Chamber are complete.\nWRATH: Tenebris be praised.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: (STEAM SPRAYING EVERYWHERE. THE IGRIS ADVANCES, SNARLING. BORITZ’S STRAINING TO PULL BACK THE CROSSBOW HE’S CARRYING. )\nBORITZ: Stay out of its way. Soon as this crossbow’s loaded, I’11 [kill] -\nDOCTOR: That won’t work, Boritz, they’re practically indestructible! Teesha, look out! It’s reaching for you!\nDUKHIN: Teesha!\nDOCTOR: Keep the steam spray between it and us — Try and get for the door on the other side of the room.\nDOCTOR: Dukhin, stay out of its reach!\nBORITZ: That’s it! Crossbow’s loaded. Stand back, I’m going to put a bolt through that monster’s heart!\nDOCTOR: Of course! Boritz! Drop the crossbow!\nBORITZ: Are you mad?\nDOCTOR: Dukhin said the Igris rebelled when they were provoked! They’re not naturally aggressive!\nTEESHA: (SCREAMS, BUFFETED) DOCTOR!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 59\nDUKHIN: Please Doctor — don’t let it kill her!\nDOCTOR: It knows you’re armed, Boritz! Like the ones outside! They didn’t attack first!\nBORITZ: But - !\nDOCTOR: They’re animals! They don’t have an agenda! They kill to eat, or to defend themselves!\nBORITZ: Well, so do I!\nDUKHIN: (EXPLODING) Put it down!\nDUKHIN: (DUKHIN SMACKS BORITZ IN THE FACE! HE FALLS, DROPPING THE CROSSBOW. THE IGRIS CALMS.)\nDOCTOR: I should have realised sooner. The Igris on Sharnax had suffered years of monstrous abuse. But this one hasn’t yet become so angry and afraid, have you?\nTEESHA: (GETTING HER BREATH BACK) Well, that’s an improvement. Now what?\nDUKHIN: I can’t hear them outside. Maybe they’ve gone.\nTEESHA: Let’s check. Help me with this door, Dukhin...\nDUKHIN: Right-o.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Boritz’s stunned. Quite a clout you gave him, Dukhin. I wouldn’t have thought you had it in you — just goes to show, one should never judge a bound opuscule by its exterior aspect... He’s coming round...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 60\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Oh, you got the door then.\nDUKHIN: That wasn’t us.\nWRATH: Intruders located.\nTEESHA: They’ve got us, Doctor! Run!\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Don’t resist, Teesha! I’1l free you both, I promise!\nDOCTOR: Boritz, come on!\nBORITZ: (OFF, GROGGY) What, eh —\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Quickly, the other door!\nWRATH: Do not move. Disobey and you will die.\nWRATH: (WRATH FLAMEBOLTS FIRE AS THE DOCTOR AND BORITZ RUN FOR THE\nOTHER: DOOR. IT OPENS)\nWRATH: Stop. Stop.\nWRATH: Two intruders have escaped. Two are captured.\nDUKHIN: I think they mean us.\nTEESHA: Yes. Some rescuers we are.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: TEESHA/DUKHIN: Oooof !\nWRATH: You will be confined until Lord Deliverer Tenebris requests your presence. You will not attempt to escape.\nTEESHA: Disobey and we die?\nWRATH: Correct.\nTEESHA: Thought so.\nTEESHA: TEESHAs: Great.\nDUKHIN: It’s so dark. Can you see anything?\nVINCOL: Junior Consul Dukhin?\nDUKHIN: Advocate Vincol? Is that you? Is the Empress with you?\nCHENT: I’m here, Dukhin.\nDUKHIN: Empress Cheni! You survived.\nCHENT: If you call this surviving.\nTEESHA: (SUDDEN DEFERENCE) Very honoured to meet you, your Royalness.\nCHENT: (REGAL) You’re very kind.\nDUKHIN: This is Teesha, Ma’am. She’s from Cawdor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 62\nTEESHA: We’re sort of... here to rescue you.\nVINCOL: And now you’re locked up with us. Well done, both of you. Sterling work.\nTEESHA: The Wrath captured us. That wasn’t actually part of the plan. But don’t worry — the Doctor’1ll get us out of here. I hope.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 63\nBORITZ: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: A ventilation duct. It’s a little cramped, I know. But stick with me, it’ll become second nature in no time.\nBORITZ: Are you sure this is the way to your ship?\nDOCTOR: We’re not going back to the TARDIS. We’re following these wires. They’ll take us to the station’s Avionics Nexus.\nBORITZ: You’re going to get us killed!\nDOCTOR: Screw your courage to the sticking-place, Mission-Controller, and we’ll not fail. Well, we might — but it won’t be for want of trying. The Avionics Nexus is this station’s nerve-centre. From there, we can locate Teesha, Dukhin and the Drashani prisoners.\nBORITZ: You’re still planning to rescue their Empress?\nDOCTOR: Well, that is why we’re here. Help me with this grille.\nDOCTOR: (SCREWS AND BRACKETS. THE GRILLE COMES LOOSE, DROPS TO THE DECK BELOW)\nDOCTOR: The Avionics Nexus! Let’s get down there, Boritz. Perhaps you could give me a hand...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 64\nTEESHA: If you only brought three Igris on your starcruiser.. where did the others came from?\nDUKHIN: I don’t know. They’re a genetically modified race. They say the creatures they’re derived from are found on just one world, deep within the Pherkad Array. Maybe the Wrath learned its location. Enslaved them —\nVINCOL: The Pherkad Array? Ha! Grow up, Dukhin. That’s a lie! A story we tell our children, so they can sleep at night. Only a fool’d believe that.\nCHENTI: I believed it, Vincol.\nVINCOL: Ah... Forgive me, Ma’am — I didn’t mean — I assumed you knew —\nCHENTI: I don’t. Tell me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 65\nBORITZ: This is the heart of the station’s power-grid?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Correct. Somewhat basic, but it does the job.\nBORITZ: And if it failed?\nDOCTOR: All systems would abort. Oxygen would stop pumping, heating would shut down. Every door and hatch would seal, you’d be trapped wherever you were in the station. Just... waiting. I imagine you’d probably have a couple of hours before a closed system this size became unable to sustain life in the vacuum. Why do you ask?\nBORITZ: No reason.\nDOCTOR: Aha! According to the schematics, there are supply modules on the inner hub — perfect for storing prisoners. We should - (BEAT) Boritz? Where are you? I thought I told you not to wander off. I usually do.\nDOCTOR: Oh, just wait a moment will you? Let me get this blessed headset untangled! (PAUSE) There. Go ahead. (PAUSE) Yes, this is he. To whom am I speaking? (SURPRISED) Olerik?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 66\nCHENTI: This is abominable.\nVINCOL: It’s not your fault, Ma’am. It was House Sorsha. Their scientists began the experiments long before you were born.\nCHENT: But my family continued them! This was done in my name — I must undo this wrong.\nDUKHIN: Begging you pardon, Ma’am. I don’t think you can.\nTEESHA: The Wrath are coming. Tenebris must’ve summoned us.\nVINCOL: You must continue the deception, Ma’am. You’re Qatreem Voss, my aide, remember.\nCHENT: No, Vincol. The time for deception is past. If he hates the Drashani so, perhaps Tenebris can be sated with the life of their Empress. Perhaps he’ll let the rest of you walk free.\nVINCOL: I won’t allow that, Ma’am.\nDUKHIN: Nor me.\nCHENT: I’m your ruler and I will be obeyed. If that’s what it takes, that’s what I’1l do.\nWRATH: Tenebris requests audience with the Drashani leader. Please identify.\nCHENT: I am [Empress Cheni] — mmmph! (A STRUGGLE) How dare -! Get your hands off me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 67\nTEESHA: (EXERTION) Sorry. Always uppity, this one. Ideas above her station.\nVINCOL: (CONFLICTED) Ah, yes. Absolutely. But perhaps you could be a little more gentle with her...?\nWRATH: Identify your leader. If you disobey, you will all die.\nVINCOL: I’m the leader.\nDUKHIN: I’m the leader too.\nWRATH: You will both accompany us. Tenebris awaits you in this station’s Control Room.\nWRATH: (THEY HAUL DUKHIN AND VINCOL OUT. CELL-DOOR SLAMS. TEESHA\nRELEASES: CHENI, BOTH CATCH THEIR BREATH. )\nCHENTI: (ANGRILY) What was that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 68\nDOCTOR: Olerik — where did you find a radio?\nOLERIK: We’ve won back the Castle catacombs, Doctor. Many Wrath have died at our hands. The father of my brood would be proud.\nDOCTOR: The father of your brood. Athrid. Oh, I’m sorry, Olerik. I have bad news. Athrid -\nOLERIK: Fell in battle. I know. I felt him go. Doctor, did he die bravely? Did it mean something?\nDOCTOR: (LYING) Yes.\nOLERIK: Good. He’d have wanted that. The old fool. (SIGHS) Well, with him gone, I’ve an insurrection to mount.\nDOCTOR: You can’t defeat the Wrath, Olerik! Don’t you understand? They have power you can barely conceive!\nOLERIK: But they die when you run a sword through their hearts, just like anyone else. I’m not here to debate, Doctor - I’ve got to tell you something. We found some of the mission control crew here in hiding, they showed us this equipment. But they noticed something else. There were explosives missing from the armoury in the catacombs.\nDOCTOR: What?\nOLERIK: You could only get in with an entry code, and they were all personalised. Doctor. We know who took it.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 69\nBOMB: Tactical explosive unit primed. Enter override code to disable safety features.\nBOMB: Override code verified. Mission-Controller Boritz. Safety features disabled. Insert detonator to activate final sequence.\nDOCTOR: Boritz! For pity’s sake, man — what on earth are you doing!\nBORITZ: The Drashani brought the apocalypse down on Cawdor, Doctor! Only fair I send them to hell too! Why else d’you think I came? Don’t imagine you can talk me out of it.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t. Not for a moment.\nDOCTOR: You know, that’s quite unusual for me. I think there’s just something about your face that makes people want to hit it. I’ll take that detonator, thank you. (HE TAKES IT) On your feet, back into the ventilation system with you.\nBORITZ: You’re not leaving me here?\nDOCTOR: I need another pair of hands. I can’t open the grilles on my own. Life was much easier when I still had a sonic screwdriver. Actually, I’d settle for a regular screwdriver.\nBORITZ: The Drashani were going to strip-mine Cawdor. They abandoned us to the Wrath. You really think I’m going to help save their Empress?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 70\nDOCTOR: No. But I think you might be willing to save yourself. My priority is getting the Empress off this station. You can come with me and have the faintest chance of survival. Or I can leave you here to face the wrath of the... er, Wrath. Up to you. I take it you’d prefer the former option.\nBORITZ: I... I... Yes. Yes, I suppose I do.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then let’s be on our way. Give me a boost up, there’s a good fellow.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 71\nWRATH: Kneel before Lord Deliverer Tenebris. Disobey and you will die. (BEAT) Slowly.\nDUKHIN: OK, don’t push!\nTENEBRIS: You are the leaders of the Drashani delegation?\nVINCOL: Of those you left alive, yes.\nDUKHIN: And you’re Tenebris? The warlord Tenebris?\nTENEBRIS: That is the name I use.\nDUKHIN: Why do you hate us, Tenebris? What did we do to you?\nTENEBRIS: Do?\nDUKHIN: A hundred worlds, reduced to rubble! It must have some meaning, some purpose. What do you want?\nTENEBRIS: I want nothing from your Empire. Nothing tangible. Only... justice.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 72\nCHENTI: You had no right to stop me. I’m the Empress!\nTEESHA: Not my Empress. To me, you’re an over-privileged berk with a death-wish.\nCHENT: How dare you - !\nCHENT: (METALLIC SCRATCHING. A GRILLE CLANGS TO THE DECK. THE TWO\nWOMEN: STOP FIGHTING. )\nDOCTOR: Hello. Your numbers look a little depleted.\nDOCTOR: TEESHA/CHENI: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Let’s postpone the salutations, shall we? Give me your hands, I’1l haul you up here into the ventilation system. Then we can all get off this station.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 73\nVINCOL: I’m a diplomat, Tenebris. Whatever happened to you, I guarantee the Empire can offer you appropriate compensation.\nTENEBRIS: The Empire made me what I am! Do you think I’d surrender that?\nVINCOL: You said you wanted justice, I thought —\nTENEBRIS: Yes, justice! For those you tore asunder.\nVINCOL: I don’t understand...\nDUKHIN: (QUIET) The Igris.\nWRATH: All Igris have now been located, Lord Deliverer. Those still at\nWRATH: liberty will be brought here.\nTENEBRIS: Watch the Igris, Drashani. Now you’1l understand.\nTENEBRIS: (A LOW TONE, RISING IN PITCH. A PSYCHIC FORCE — SIMILAR BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO THE ACHERON PULSE. THE IGRIS BECOME AGITATED. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR LEADS TEESHA, CHENI AND BORITZ ALONG THE PIPE. ALL\nCRAWLING: NOISILY. )\nBORITZ: Come on...\nCHENTI: We've got to find the other survivors from my starcruiser. We have to release them before we leave the space-station.\nDOCTOR: When you’re safe, I promise I’1l come back for them.\nCHENT: No, we free them now!\nDOCTOR: What?\nTEESHA: She’s been like this since Vincol told us about the Igris.\nDOCTOR: What about them?\nTEESHA: She thought they were natural. Some unevolved, primitive life- form. But they’re not.\nCHENT: Don’t tell him!\nTEESHA: When their Empire expanded, the Drashani took prisoners on every new world. Soldiers, rebels, dissidents — anyone who resisted. Their scientists experimented on them.\nCHENTI: No...\nDOCTOR: I thought the Igris were a genetically altered species. Are you saying the Drashani created them from their own captives?\nTEESHA: The scientists learned how to regress them to a primordial state, fit for mindless labour. Distilled away their higher brain functions.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 75\nDOCTOR: That’s horrible.\nTEESHA: Isn’t it.\nCHENTI: I’m so sorry...\nBORITZ: Look! Through the grille! Something’s happening.\nBORITZ: (MUFFLED IGRIS GROWLS, AND THE WRATH GESTALT. THEY STOP CRAWLING)\nDOCTOR: He’s right. The Wrath are rounding up the Igris. They’re taking them to the main Control Room.\nCHENTI: Why?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. But we should find out, I think. We’ve spent more than enough time in these ventilation pipes, it’1l be good to stretch our legs.\nBORITZ: What? But what about your “getting off the station” idea? I liked that...\nDOCTOR: Patience, Mission-Controller. Help me with this grille.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE PSYCHIC FORCE IS AT VERY HIGH FREQUENCY. IGRIS SHRIEK IN PAIN! )\nDUKHIN: Tenebris! Stop! The Igris are in agony!\nTENEBRIS: Silence, Drashani! This is the legacy of your imperialism!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR'S PARTY WATCH, UNSEEN. UNLESS NOTED, THEY’RE WHISPERING. IGRIS SHRIEKS CONTINUE, AT A DISTANCE. )\nTEESHA: Was that Dukhin? Is he alright? I can’t see anything from here.\nBORITZ: Shush! Don’t let them hear you!\nDOCTOR: Dukhin and Vincol appear unharmed. But I can’t say the same for the Igris.\nCHENT: That must be Tenebris.\nDOCTOR: He certainly he fits the description.\nCHENT: He’s tearing the Igris apart with some psychic force. Those poor creatures!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nBORITZ: What’s that? There’s some kind of energy around them, in the air.\nTEESHA: I see it. It’s making them shimmer.\nDOCTOR: .AS though something’s forming.\nCHENI: (NOT WHISPERING) It’s monstrous! I can’t watch this! I’ve got to stop it!\nDOCTOR: Cheni, no!\nBORITZ: Doctor! She’ll get us all killed! We’ve got to get away before the Wrath spot us!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 78\nTEESHA: Too late!\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) Teesha — take this. Keep it safe.\nTEESHA: What is it? A detonator?\nDOCTOR: For Boritz’s bomb. I can’t risk Tenebris getting hold of it, who knows what he might do.\nTEESHA: Boritz’s bomb?\nBORITZ: I was going blow up the Avionics Nexus - cut the power to the life-support. (DEFENSIVE) What? I didn’t do it.\nDOCTOR: I'd recommend you both give yourselves up. It’s only the\nDOCTOR: Drashani they hate, remember.\nTEESHA: Why, what are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Cheni’s forced my hand rather. I’m going to try to reason with our masked adversary.\nWRATH: Surrender! Or you will be incinerated!\nTEESHA: They’ve seen us!\nBORITZ: Surrender to them? No chance, there’s time, we can still get away, run!\nTEESHA: Boritz, don’t be a fool!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003)\nTEESHA: Oh, Boritz...\nWRATH: Surrender. Or you will be incinerated.\nTEESHA: I don’t have much choice, do I?\nTEESHA: Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE PSYCHIC WHINE RISES, IGRIS MOAN IN PAIN. CHENI MARCHES IN. )\nCHENI: Tenebris! Tenebris! Stop this at once!\nTENEBRIS: You? How can it be you?\nDUKHIN: No, your highness, get back, you -\nWRATH: Halt. Or we will destroy you.\nDUKHIN: I’ve halted, I’ve halted!\nCHENT: I order you to stop this obscenity!\nTENEBRIS: Aliona? Still so young...?\nCHENT: What? No. Aliona was my cousin. I’m Cheni — daughter of Tuvold.\nTENEBRIS: Your cousin? You’re the Empress?\nCHENT: And you’re a backwater warlord. I demand you release the Igris. I won’t see them tortured!\nDOCTOR: Cheni, please, Tenebris is more dangerous than you know. It would best if you let me deal with him.\nTENEBRIS: What are you, her jester? Going by your attire I assume that’s your role in the proceedings.\nDOCTOR: The Wrath call you Lord Deliverer. What did you save them from, I wonder?\nTENEBRIS: You could not begin to imagine.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 81\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m rather afraid I can. I’ve been watching your right hand, Tenebris. There’s a delay, a microsecond or two, most people wouldn’t even notice. It’s a cybernetic appliance, isn’t it? You know, I met a young Drashani once, quite a temperamental chap - his hand was severed in the skies above Sharnax, I wonder if perhaps you could be related...\nTENEBRIS: (QUIET) Who are you? How could you know this?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor.\nTENEBRIS: The Doctor? But your face... it’s... it’s changed.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) And so has yours. I’d hoped I was wrong.\nCHENTI: The Doctor has no authority here, warlord. I do. I ordered you to release the Igris.\nTENEBRIS: Very well.\nCHENT: You're killing them! Stop now! Or I’1l stop you myself!\nDOCTOR: Vincol, Dukhin, keep her back! Don’t let her interfere!\nVINCOL: Ma’am, please!\nVINCOL: (HE DRAGS CHENI OFF TO A SAFE DISTANCE. THE SOUNDS OF THE IGRIS\nARE: FADING. )\nCHENT: Doctor, they’re dying! The Igris are dying!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. The energy around them’s taking shape! Becoming alive! Can’t you see what’s happening?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 82\nDUKHIN: Emperor’s blood! More Wrath!\nCHENT: Forming out of thin air!\nDOCTOR: He’s releasing the Igris — precisely as you demanded. Freeing them from their suffering.\nCHENTI: What?\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that right? Prince Kylo?\nCHENTI: Kylo? You’re -\nTENEBRIS: Yes. So you do understand, jester. I am glad. Thanks to you, the Empire will know at last the nemesis that scourges their worlds.

I am glad. Thanks to you, the Empire will know at last the nemesis that scourges their worlds. I am Kylo, last heir of Sorsha. And the Igris are my WRATH!\nDOCTOR: I suspected as much. But your appearance here’s something of a surprise. I thought you’d fallen to your death thirty years ago on Sharnax.\nTENEBRIS: And I did. Kylo died that day. Why do you think I chose a new name? That sad, unworldly prince is long gone. Now only Tenebris remains.\nDOCTOR: He wasn’t sad, he was young. Naive. Used.\nTENEBRIS: He was a fool!\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing foolish about love. And you really did love Aliona, didn’t you?\nTENEBRIS: (BEAT) It is you, isn’t it? The Doctor. But you look so different.\nDOCTOR: Oh my species have a somewhat relaxed attitude towards personal physiognomy. I change my face with remarkable alacrity. (BEAT) How did you survive the fall? Telekinesis?\nTENEBRIS: The secret shame of my family. My dead family. For years, they hid me away, until the war took both my brothers. Then they dispatched me to the altar with my dowry, like a girl. They medicated the fires in my mind. And after years of disgrace... it’s my mind that saves me at the end.\nDOCTOR: I saw your power. It was beyond your control.\nTENEBRIS: Aliona dropped me out of an airlock, thirty three thousand feet up. You’d be surprised how quickly that can focus the mind.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: (AIR WHIPS AND ROARS! ALMOST BURIED IN THE TORNADE-FORCE GALES, KYLO’S SCREAM FROM SCENE 111 OF ‘BURNING PRINCE’. )\nTENEBRIS: The ability to psychically manoeuvre objects without touching them. That’s how you described it, Doctor. If only you’d experienced it. I didn’t consciously understand what I’d done at first, it happened almost without thinking. But when I looked back, I knew. As I fell, the swamp had reached up to me. Not just plants and animals - the earth, the water, the atmosphere itself. Every molecule, all connected, and I was a part of it. I was a mote in the air, I was the air that carried the mote. And every vein in my body burned so brightly!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: (CHENI, DUKHIN AND VINCOL WATCH FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE\nCONTROL: ROOM.\nVINCOL: What’s he saying?

BURN!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 89\nTENEBRIS: The Igris saw my mind’s fury unleashed. Power beyond their primal comprehension. They bowed down. Made me their leader... their God. What else could they do?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen a lot of suffering, Tenebris. I’ve tried to help, where I can. But there are times when suffering makes its victim a monster.\nTENEBRIS: You think I’m a monster?\nDOCTOR: You're hardly going out of your way to refute it.\nTENEBRIS: The Wrath would disagree with you. I saved their souls from exile, as you’ve seen. I gave them purpose, direction. They were blank slates, to be programmed any way I desired.\nDOCTOR: And you programmed them to hate the Drashani.\nTENEBRIS: After all the Empire had done to them, Doctor, I found they needed very little persuasion.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 90\nOLERIK: These catacombs reach every corner of the castle, clan- brothers. Surprise is on our side, we can strike before dawn. You! Any word from the archers?\nNOMAD: Yes. They sent a stormpigeon.\nOLERIK: A stormpigeon? We’re facing a world-devouring horde of demons from beyond the stars, and our archers sent a stormpigeon?\nNOMAD: Er, yes.\nOLERIK: (SIGHS) I suppose they’re doing their best. What did they say?\nNOMAD: When the third moon kisses the Peak of Carthiz, they’1ll be in position.\nOLERIK: Then we’re on. Pass the word round. The wolves of Tar’khut win back Cawdor tonight!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 91\nTENEBRIS: I fashioned the Wrath into my army and launched my fleet.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was wondering about that. Your telekinesis kept you alive, Tenebris. It gave you power over the Igris. But even a mind such as yours can’t survive the extremes of space. How did you escape Sharnax?\nTENEBRIS: You forget. Sharnax was a former mining colony.\nDOCTOR: Of course. A scrapyard of dilapidated derelicts.\nTENEBRIS: It took me twenty-five years to construct my fleet. But construct: 1t).1 did.\nDOCTOR: And did you also fashion the Acheron Pulse from the flotsam you found on Sharnax?\nTENEBRIS: You give me too much credit. I’m not that clever. The Acheron Pulse was my Wraths’ gift to me, in gratitude for their salvation.\nDOCTOR: Then your weapon comes from the Wrath themselves?\nTENEBRIS: From their suffering — powered and directed by my rudimentary technology.\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand.\nTENEBRIS: The scientists of House Sorsha created the Igris by tearing out their prisoners’ souls, Doctor. Did you not think to wonder where those souls went?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 92\nCHENT: We should help him.\nVINCOL: Stay here, ma’am. We’re safe as long as the Doctor’s got his attention.\nTEESHA: Dukhin — your arm? Are you hurt?\nDUKHIN: It’s nothing.\nTEESHA: No, let me look...\nCHENI: It’s been burnt!\nTEESHA: When did this happen?\nDUKHIN: When I tried to stop the Empress approaching Tenebris. One of the Wrath flamebolts must have... winged me...\nCHENT: It was that close?\nVINCOL: He’s slightly singed, that’s all.\nTEESHA: You could have been incinerated!\nCHENTI: It’s my fault. He was trying to protect me.\nVINCOL: Of course he was.\nCHENT: But I don’t deserve that - my family’s actions shame the name of Gadarel. Of the Empire!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 93\nVINCOL: Dukhin would lay down his life for you, Ma’am. As would I.\nCHENTI: Then your Empress can do no less.\nDUKHIN: Highness?\nVINCOL: The Doctor told me to keep you away from Tenebris, Ma’am.\nCHENT: And are you the Doctor’s subject, Vincol? Or mine?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX FROM SCENE 114 OF ‘THE BURNING PRINCE’ —\nSTAGNANT: POOLS BUBBLE. UNKNOWN CREATURES SCUTTLE AND BELCH. )\nTENEBRIS: I was marooned on Sharnax for two and a half decades. I had always felt a link to the Igris. Mentally. I reached out to them, and the barrier between their minds and mine crumbled. I found I could soothe their pain - their rage. And one day... I broke through.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: (A SOUND LIKE TEARING PAPER. THEN... BIRDS’ WINGS FLAP. ROARING,\nRUSHING: AIR. CHATTERING VOICES — LIKE THE WRATH GESTALT MIND... BUT THESE VOICES ARE DISCORDANT. FRIGHTENED. HURT. OCCASIONAL WAILS AND SCREAMS. )\nTENEBRIS: I didn’t mean to go there. But the membrane separating the Igris from that other place was so very fragile. Like cobwebs...\nLOST SOULS: Kylo. / Please, Kylo. / Help me. / Find us. / Free us.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 96\nDOCTOR: You tore a hole through to them. What did you find on the other Side? A pocket dimension?\nTENEBRIS: Nothing so commonplace. I found a wasteland of the mind. Perhaps it was created spontaneously, by the Drashani experiments. Or perhaps it always existed, waiting for spirits to populate it.\nDOCTOR: You brought them back.\nTENEBRIS: One by one, I freed their disembodied souls. I fashioned them into the Wrath.\nDOCTOR: And in doing so, created the Acheron Pulse. An obscene weapon that has no place in our universe.\nTENEBRIS: Would you have done differently, Doctor? Or would you have left them to drift forever, formless and alone?\nDOCTOR: Maybe that would have been best.\nTENEBRIS: You can’t imagine that place, Doctor. I called it the Undervoid. But were I a religious man, I’d know it by its true name.\nCHENTI: Purgatory.\nDOCTOR: Empress! I told you to stay with the others!\nCHENT: I’m not in the habit of taking orders, Doctor.\nTENEBRIS: Aliona...\nCHENT: Cheni.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 97\nTENEBRIS: Cheni, yes, Cheni.\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) Imperial Highness - your subjects attest to your sagacity. But believe me, your wisest course is to not say another word. Truly, it’s for all our sakes!\nTENEBRIS: The Empress wishes to speak. And I wish to hear her. We’ve quite a history, her family and I.\nCHENT: (FORMAL) Prince Kylo - as ruler of the Drashani Empire, I kneel before you in penitent humility.\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nCHENT: You surrendered your life in defence of fair Aliona, and Tenebris the warlord was born of your sacrifice. My Empire’s scientists created the Igris, and the Wrath rose from their pain. The Doctor called you a monster, but there are no monsters here. We are all victims.\nTENEBRIS: In defence of fair Aliona? Is that what you said?\nDOCTOR: Empress!\nCHENT: The last heir of Sorsha gave all to protect his pure bride from those who opposed their union. And yet you live! When the Empire hears this glorious news, there will be rejoicing like nothing [in memory] —\nTENEBRIS: ? (BOILING RAGE) His pure bride? His pure... bride?\nCHENT: Yes, his — what’s the matter?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: (NIGHT SOUNDS. AND A CADRE OF NOMADS, CLAMBERING OUT OF THE CATACOMBS... AS STEALTHY AS THEIR CLANKING ARMOUR ALLOWS. )\nOLERIK: (WHISPERS) Is everyone out of the catacombs? Good. Close the doors — pay attention!\nOLERIK: When the third moon skims Carthiz Peak, our archers are going to open fire from the hillside. While the Wrath are busy with them, we’ll take the East Gate. That’1l open the way for the horsemen. Any questions? (SILENCE) Good. Then for the next two minutes, I want you praying to your ancestors. It’s time those Spiritual layabouts started earning their offerings!\nNOMADS: Yes leader!\nNOMAD: The hillside, look! The arrows are flying!\nOLERIK: Well, that’s it then. Forget the prayers, clan-brothers! Trust in the man beside you and your own right arm! (YELLS) BLOOD AND GLORY!\nNOMADS: BLOOD AND GLORY!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 99\nDOCTOR: Tenebris! Kylo! Listen to me! Cheni doesn’t know what you’ve suffered! I do. Don’t listen to her - listen to me!\nTENEBRIS: My pure bride? That murderess!\nCHENT: Doctor! What’s wrong with him?\nDOCTOR: Excuse my lack of tact, your Highness — but please, stop talking! Tenebris! You’ve burned a path halfway to the Gadarel Homeworld. What happens when you get there?\nTENEBRIS: I will have vengeance, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: You won’t find what you’re looking for, Kylo. Aliona died thirty years ago. She escaped you!\nTENEBRIS: Do you think I don’t know that? I found out when I left Sharnax. After all those years, all those years of pain, to discover the one who caused them is gone. Long gone! Can you imagine how that feels?\nDOCTOR: What are you going to do? Destroy an Empire, simply because you fell for the wrong princess?\nTENEBRIS: YES!\nCHENTI: No, Doctor, I have heard enough.\nDOCTOR: Cheni, please!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 100\nCHENT: I said no!\nTENEBRIS: What?\nCHENT: Tenebris is a mask, Doctor. The man behind it is not Tenebris. He’s Kylo, a Drashani of noble birth. People don’t change, whatever terrible things they might have experienced.\nDOCTOR: Oh, they do. They really do. Take my word for it.\nTENEBRIS: The Empress wishes to say something, Doctor, I would advise you to let her.\nCHENT: I am most grateful, noble Prince. Earlier, I offered my Empire’s contrition to you. That was not enough. I’ve known the tale of Kylo and Aliona since I was a babe in arms. I should have understood these stories don’t end with recompense. They end with... love.\nTENEBRIS: Love.\nDOCTOR: Love?\nCHENT: Yes — love.\nTENEBRIS: Love. Ah. Bless.\nCHENT: Together, sweet Kylo, we’ll undo the errors of my father’s generation. The Great Houses of Gadarel and Sorsha will be united, as they were always meant to be. I offer you my hand in marriage — and a place beside me on the Drashani throne.\nDOCTOR: No.\nTENEBRIS: (BEAT) You think a royal wedding will end this war?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 101\nCHENT: All fairytales end with marriage.\nTENEBRIS: (ALMOST BUYING IT) You would wed me?\nCHENI: I would. My cousin was lost to you, but I shall take her place. In time, you might come to love me as you did her.\nTENBERIS: T=\nCHENI: Please.\nTENEBRIS: (BEAT) You may remove my mask. I would have my bride look upon my naked face.\nDOCTOR: Cheni.. I’m begging you. Don’t do this.\nCHENT: Doctor, you are wise in many matters. But I don’t think you understand love at all.\nCHENT: How long have you worn this mask? It doesn’t matter. Soon it will be gone. And I’1l see the face of Kylo. The noble Prince Kylo, the man I’ve loved since I was a child and —\nTENEBRIS: (HOARSE, CROAKING) It turns out the atmosphere of Sharnax is mildly acidic, Empress. None of our miners there lived long enough to notice any effects, but let me assure you that prolonged exposure is not recommended. Twenty five years grovelling in its swamps left their mark. Still, it’s what’s inside that counts.\nCHENT: Your face, it -\nDOCTOR: Cheni!\nTENEBRIS: My Wrath, hold him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 102\nDOCTOR: What? No!\nTENEBRIS: Of course you tremble. It’s revolting. I knew you would not be able to stomach it. You talk to me of love? I have heard such lies from your family before!\nCHENT: Doctor! Doctor, help me!\nTENEBRIS: He can’t! No one can. Wrath — the Acheron Pulse!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE PULSE CHAMBER'S GLASS HUMS AND SINGS.

What’s happening!\nCHENT: Help me! My thoughts, my memories... they’re slipping away...\nDOCTOR: Cheni. Oh Cheni...\nCHENT: I don’t want to lose them, Doctor. I don’t want to lose what I am.

The Acheron Pulse doesn’t kill its victims.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 105\nDOCTOR: No. It distills away their higher brain functions. Hurls their psyches into that place you called the Undervoid. Leaving only - an Igris.\nTENEBRIS: You knew?\nDOCTOR: I guessed. A dozen astronauts hit by the first Pulse. A dozen too many Igris on this space-station. Maths was never my strongest suit but that wasn’t complicated. Almost as simple as what happens next.\nTENEBRIS: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: (CERTAINTY) You’re going to bring Cheni back.\nTENEBRIS: Ha. Impossible. Once the soul’s severed and the Igris manifested, the two parts cannot be recombined.\nDOCTOR: I promised to look after her.\nTENEBRIS: You promised you’d stop Aliona killing my family too, you didn’t do that either. Wrath — guard the prisoners. If they try to escape, kill them. Doctor, come with me.\nDOCTOR: Where?\nTENEBRIS: My flagship. You asked what I’11 do when I reach Gadarel Prime.

(SHOUTING ABOVE THE BATTLE) We’1ll show them!\nOLERIK: (SHE DRAWS HER SWORD. HACK! SLASH! SQUELCH! THE SOUNDS CONTINUE\nUNDER: HER SPEECH — )\nOLERIK: These scalps are for you, father of my brood!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: (GLASS VIBRATES. HIGH ABOVE, POWER SPARKS AND FIZZES. A DOOR\nSWOOSHES: OPEN. THE DOCTOR AND TENEBRIS ENTER. )\nTENEBRIS: My Wrath call this the Pulse Chamber, Doctor. It’s here that they generate and focus their Acheron Pulse. Perhaps you recognise its central component?\nDOCTOR: A Praxis Valve. The primary power-core from the Drashani delegation’s starcruiser.\nTENEBRIS: The batteries I took from Sharnax were old. Their fading power limited my Wraths’ effectiveness. They could obliterate a town, a small island — nothing larger. That’s why this space-station was a perfect target.\nDOCTOR: But now the Pulse is a million times stronger.\nTENEBRIS: A million? You underestimate the Empire’s technological prowess, Doctor. Heated to plasmic temperatures, the gasses in the Praxis Valve produce enough energy to warp space itself.\nDOCTOR: Cheni doesn’t deserve her fate, Tenebris. If you can’t reverse her transformation, won’t you at least free her from the Undervoid? Make her a fresh Wrath, for your army.\nTENEBRIS: The Empress of the Drashani should take a little time to think about what she’s done. Twenty-five years perhaps. When I conquer Gadarel Prime, maybe I’1l parade her hollow remnant through the streets in chains. I look forward to watching her subjects turn away in disgust when they see what she’s become.\nDOCTOR: And then what?\nTENEBRIS: You must have guessed that. I’1ll unleash the Acheron Pulse. With this Praxis Valve’s power, I can target an entire planet. In a matter of hours, Gadarel Prime will be another Sharnax. A world of Igris.\nDOCTOR: I won’t let that happen.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 108\nTENEBRIS: That’s an empty vow, them.\nDOCTOR: You’1ll pay for this.\nTENEBRIS: I’ve been paying for\nDOCTOR: Mine?\nDOCTOR: Doctor. You do make rather a habit of\nDOCTOR: decades. And it’s your fault.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 109\nVINCOL: (CHILDLIKE DENIAL) She’s not gone, is she? Not really. She can’t be. That... thing will disappear, she’1ll be OK, she’11...\nDUKHIN: Chief Advocate? Are you alright?\nTEESHA: How could he be alright, after what just happened? He’s in shock. We should make him comfortable. Help me move him.\nDUKHIN: Come along, Vincol. You need to rest. Everything’s going to fine.\nVINCOL: (BROKEN) Empress Cheni’s the wisest, most noble ruler the Empire’s known...\nTEESHA: Doesn’t say much for your Empire. She had heart, though, there’s no denying that.\nDUKHIN: What’s this? You dropped it. A detonator?\nTEESHA: Oh, yeah... Boritz brought a bomb.\nDUKHIN: A bomb?\nTEESHA: He was going blow up the Avionics Nexus. The Doctor stopped him.\nVINCOL: (BEAT) Give it to me.\nTEESHA: (PICKING IT UP) Best if I hang onto it, I reckon.\nVINCOL: I said give it to me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 110\nTEESHA: And I said no!\nTEESHA: (WITH NO WARNING, VINCOL DRAWS HIS MESON-BODKIN. IT FIRES UP WITH A CRACKLE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY. )\nDUKHIN: Teesha! Watch out, he’s still got his meson-bodkin!\nVINCOL: I’ve got it!\nWRATH: A prisoner is attempting escape!

We’ve got to get to the Avionics Nexus. Stop him before he can trigger the bomb. Come on!\nTEESHA: (A WRATH FLAMEBOLT EXPLODES, CLOSE, AS THE APPROACHING WRATH ARRIVES. )\nWRATH: Prisoners will not attempt to escape.\nTEESHA: Oh don’t be stupid, I’m trying to save all of us!\nDUKHIN: Teesha - do as they say! They’1ll kill you\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 111\nDOCTOR: My fault? How is it my fault?\nTENEBRIS: You saved my life, Doctor. Don’t you remember? Kept me from death just long enough that Aliona could spring her trap and wipe out my family.\nDOCTOR: There was no way I could have predicted what she was going to do!\nTENEBRIS: Is that your defence? That you couldn’t have known? My Wraths’ crusade will continue. And you are responsible for every life we take.\nDOCTOR: No!\nWRATH: Communication from Cawdor. Status update: rebellion.\nTENEBRIS: No conqueror can tolerate civil unrest. Wrath - prepare to launch a planet-wide Acheron Pulse!\nWRATH: As you command, Lord Deliverer.\nDOCTOR: Kylo, please!\nTENEBRIS: Tenebris, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You can’t do this!\nTENEBRIS: Yes, Doctor. I can.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE BUZZ OF THE WRATH GESTALT. THE GUTTURAL GROWLS OF CHENI’S IGRIS. )\nTEESHA: We have to get out of here, Dukhin. We don’t have much time.\nDUKHIN: The Wrath will kill us if we try to get past them.\nTEESHA: Vincol made it. Maybe we can. We’ve got to try. Wish me luck.\nDUKHIN: No!\nWRATH: Halt!\nDUKHIN: Teesha! Look out! Get behind the consoles!\nDUKHIN: (FRANTIC) Here! Look at me — I’m escaping! See?\nWRATH: Ignore him. Terminate the woman.\nWRATH LEADER: The Igris is attacking! Redirect all fire. Destroy the beast.\nWRATH: Tenebris be praised.\nTEESHA: Dukhin! What’s happening?\nDUKHIN: The Empress! She’s protecting us! She’s giving her life so we can escape!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 113\nTEESHA: Well, let’s not disappoint her! Into the corridor! Come on!\nTEESHA: (THEY HURRY OUT, THE DOOR SWOOSHES CLOSED AFTER THEM. BEHIND THEM, THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE WRATH AND THE IGRIS CONTINUES. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 114\nDOCTOR: For pity’s sake! Those natives are fighting with nothing more than pointy sticks and sheer guts! They don’t stand a chance, you’ve no reason to destroy their world.\nTENEBRIS: Dismantling an Empire is bound to involve casualties, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I won’t allow this! You’ve already taken Empress Cheni. She was dragging her Empire forward! Now she’s gone and all you offer is destruction!\nWRATH: Acheron Pulse initiated.\nWRATH: (THE GLASS AND MIRRORS IN THE PULSE CHAMBER VIBRATE MORE LOUDLY, INCREASING IN PITCH...)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: (A CAVALRY CHARGE!

Retreat to the\nOLERIK: catacombs!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE WRATH MANIPULATE CONSOLES, ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHAMBER FROM THE DOCTOR AND TENEBRIS. )\nDOCTOR: The Drashani Empire’s capable of progress, Tenebris, it could be a beacon of civilisation. And you want to snuff it out!\nWRATH: Acheron Pulse engaged. Praxis spectrum gasses approaching optimal temperature. Complete planetary conversion: T minus three hours.\nWRATH LEADER: Wait. Listen.\nTENEBRIS: Unlike you, Doctor, I don’t claim to serve a greater good. I created the Wrath to enact my vengeance. The consequences are not my concern.\nDOCTOR: No. No. No! The planet below us is dying, and YOU gave the order! You can’t simply deny you’re responsible!\nWRATH LEADER: This debate is troubling. Tenebris delivered the Wrath. He gave us purpose.\nWRATH: Designation of purpose: revenge. But the Doctor claims Tenebris is incorrect.\nWRATH LEADER: If true, then the Wrath’s purpose is also incorrect.\nWRATH: This uncertainty is unacceptable. The contradiction must be resolved.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 117\nBOMB: Tactical explosive re-engaged. Safety features disabled. Insert detonator to activate final sequence.\nVINCOL: (DISTRAUGHT) Detonator... detonator... Ah! Here it is. Just need to connect it... and it’s over.\nTEESHA: Vincol! Drop the detonator! Set that bomb off and we’re all done for.\nVINCOL: The Empress is lost! Why should we live now she’s gone? This Sspace-station will become a frozen mausoleum to her eternal [glory] — oof!\nDUKHIN: I’ve got him!\nTEESHA: Less commentary! Get the detonator!\nBOMB: Detonator engaged.

You still fail to acknowledge your culpability?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ll bear that responsibility, yes. My intervention thirty years ago was instrumental in what you’ve become. But there’s still a difference between us, Tenebris.\nTENEBRIS: What difference?\nDOCTOR: I was trying to help!\nTENEBRIS: And you failed. You left me there to die, Doctor. You could have saved me. If I am a villain, I ama villain of your own creation!\nWRATH: Enough. You will be silent.\nTENEBRIS: (CALMING DOWN) Your counsel is well taken, my Wrath. I was becoming distracted by this vagabond’s irrelevancies —\nDOCTOR: Irrelevancies? VAGABOND??\nWRATH: You will BOTH be silent.\nTENEBRIS: What?! You are my Wrath. I gave you form. I programmed you! You do not tell me to be silent!\nWRATH: The Doctor contradicts your paradigm. He advocates progress, not vengeance. Only one philosophy will be permitted.\nTENEBRIS: Doctor — that noise!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 119\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING OVER THE DIN) The Acheron Pulse! No! Don’t you see, Tenebris? The Wrath are turning your weapon on us!\nTENEBRIS: No! No, stop my creatures! You obey me!\nDOCTOR: It’s too late for that now, I’m afraid. They’ve made their decision!

This pulse weapon grows stronger every minute, soon it’ll reach us even in these catacombs. When that happens, we'll die — but as warriors!

Why would they turn on me? Why send me here — with you?\nDOCTOR: Well, you wouldn’t be the first god whose creations decided they could do without his guiding hand. But I rather think this is a little more complicated.\nTENEBRIS: Explain.\nDOCTOR: Since we materialised in this pocket dimension, have you seen yourself? Have you seen me? Did you notice anything?\nTENEBRIS: You’re playing games, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: For someone who’s spent three decades plotting vengeance, you’re surprisingly impatient. I’1ll give you a hint: the Acheron Pulse sends its victims’ incorporeal psyches into the void. Leaving their regressed physical bodies back in our ‘real’ universe.\nTENEBRIS: I know that.\nDOCTOR: Then don’t you think it’s odd you’re still wearing that mask of yours, and I’m my usual model of sartorial insouciance? For a pair of incorporeal psyches, we’re both very material indeed, wouldn’t you say?\nTENEBRIS: The Wrath have sent our physical bodies to the Undervoid? But why?\nDOCTOR: You told me it’s impossible to recombine a life-force with its Igris form once the two parts have been severed. So I surmise the reason we’re both in one piece is that your Wrath intend to bring us back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 123\nTENEBRIS: Bring us back? Oh, you’re not so naive, Doctor. They said only one philosophy can be permitted. It shall be but one they bring back.\nDOCTOR: That might have been their intention, yes. But you said the Wrath are blank slates. Tabulae rasa, ready to be imprinted with any purpose. All they ask is certainty. I believe they’1l free us both from the Undervoid if we offer a single, unopposed morality they can live by.\nTENEBRIS: You propose we compromise?\nDOCTOR: It does seem the most sensible solution. If I can help you and the Drashani reach a settlement, this war can end. With the proper encouragement, the Wrath could even become a force for good.\nTENEBRIS: You called me a monster. You said I offered only destruction.\nDOCTOR: Well, you were hardly the most gracious host at that point. If we call a halt to your hostilities, we [can] —\nTENEBRIS: You don’t understand, Doctor. You called me a monster. You were right.\nDOCTOR: Tenebris! The Wrath’s creed is absolute! We have to work together — otherwise, they’1ll never stop!\nDOCTOR: No!\nTENEBRIS: Only one of us can be permitted, Doctor! And it shall be\nTENEBRIS: Tenebris.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 124\nWRATH LEADER: The paradigm of Lord Deliverer Tenebris rejects compromise. The Doctor seeks compromise.\nWRATH: His approach is unlikely to succeed.\nWRATH LEADER: When Tenebris crushes the Doctor, the Wrath will accept his programming. The Doctor will be abandoned in the Undervoid.\nWRATH: We will obey our Lord Deliverer. The Drashani Empire will be erased.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE AMBIENT GALES ARE PUNCTUATED BY PYROKINETIC BLASTS, SOME\nWAY: DISTANT.

But when you’re dead and Gadarel Prime burns, the whole Drashani Empire will fear my name!\nTENEBRIS: (THE DOCTOR'S BREATHING HARD.

You’ve got three minutes til that thing blows. I’1ll make it feel like a lifetime.\nVINCOL: I think you would.\nVINCOL: (VINCOL FLINGS DUKHIN OFF, FUMBLES IN HIS POCKETS.

A million spirits — torn from their bodies and hurled into perdition. And I am at least partially responsible.\nDOCTOR: That’s not true.\nCHENT: Isn’t it? You know it is. I never knew my father, Doctor. You did. You said he was a good man.\nDOCTOR: One of the best and bravest I’ve known.\nCHENTI: Then I fear I have let him down.\nDOCTOR: No. You’ve honoured him. It’s me that let him down. I promised him I’d watch over you. Then I let this happen. You must despise me.\nCHENT: Everyone’s always telling me how sorry they are they failed me. Just once, it’d be nice to take a little responsibility myself.\nDOCTOR: Cheni. None of this is your fault. You couldn’t have known the truth about Tenebris!\nCHENT: I should have done! All my life, I’ve been told the tale of Kylo and Aliona. How they died for each other, how the Empire mourned their loss.\nDOCTOR: The power of a carefully crafted political lie. Governments survive, the status quo’s maintained. Everybody’s happy. Particularly manufacturers of commemorative crockery.\nCHENT: But I believed it all! How could I be so unworldly?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 131\nDOCTOR: You shouldn’t castigate yourself. Before he became Tenebris, Prince Kylo was more credulous than you ever were. Even I used to believe my own dear planet’s propaganda, until I puta little distance between us.\nCHENT: Was he always like this?\nDOCTOR: No. And that’s the tragedy. He was a decent chap. Highly strung, yes, naive, certainly, but decent. He could see the good in even the most savage Igris and... (STOPS HIMSELF) Actually, I wonder...\nCHENTI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: His war began after he broke through to them... after he learned the truth of their creation... Hmm. I think I might\nDOCTOR: have an idea. Cheni — I’m going to speak to him.\nCHENTI: Is that wise?\nDOCTOR: Well, I can’t run forever, so I don’t have much choice. But... but I would be happier if we had a backup plan...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 132\nBOMB: Ninety-one... ninety... eighty-nine... (ETC)\nDUKHIN: (TERRIFIED) Oh sweet Luko, we’re going to die. We’re going to die...\nTEESHA: (DECISIVE) Dukhin — I need you to do something. I need you to hold me. Tight.\nDUKHIN: Because we’re going to die?\nTEESHA: What? Don’t be stupid. No, because I’m going to open the Avionics Nexus to the vacuum. If I time it exactly, the energy from the bomb’s blast will vent into space along with the air.\nDUKHIN: Will that work?\nTEESHA: If the bomb’s small enough. Boritz didn’t intend to blow up the station, he only brought enough explosives to knock out the computers. But we’1ll choke unless I close the doors again - and I’m going to need both hands to operate the controls, so I won’t be able to hold on. If you let me go, I’1l be sucked out into space.\nDUKHIN: But my arm — it’s burnt, remember.\nTEESHA: If there was anyone else here, they’d be first pick but there’s not. You’1ll have to do.\nDUKHIN: And the bomb won’t kill us?\nTEESHA: No idea. But it’s got to be worth a shot, hasn’t it?\nDUKHIN: Oh. Right. OK.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 133\nTEESHA: Good. Over here then, get behind these cables, use them to secure yourself.\nTEESHA: (WITH MUCH GRUNTING AND GASPING, DUKHIN GETS HIMSELF INTO POSITION. )\nBOMB: Seventy-three... seventy-two... seventy-one... (ETC)\nTEESHA: Are you ready?\nDUKHIN: Think so.\nTEESHA: (INHALES, PREPARING) Here we go then. Put your arms round me. Hold me tight.\nDUKHIN: OK.\nTEESHA: Round my waist.\nDUKHIN: sorry.\nBOMB: Sixty-two... sixty-one... sixty...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 134\nTENEBRIS: Why prolong your suffering, Doctor? Show yourself, finish this. My Wrath await their Lord Deliverer’s return.\nDOCTOR: Yes Tenebris. Let’s end this now.\nTENEBRIS: So you've tired of hiding.\nDOCTOR: You don’t need to kill me.\nTENEBRIS: Are you begging for your life? I think such a substantial request would be better made on your knees.\nDOCTOR: I’m not bargaining for myself. I’m bargaining for the Igris.\nTENEBRIS: The Igris?\nDOCTOR: This war’s at least partially on their behalf, isn’t it? You feel a kinship with them. Both of you betrayed by the Empire. You want vengeance for the wrongs they’ve endured, that you’ve both endured. Well... that can’t happen, not without unspooling time itself.\nTENEBRIS: But I can make the Drashani Empire pay for its sins.\nDOCTOR: By creating even more Igris, with your Acheron Pulse?\nTENEBRIS: You’re a wanderer, Doctor. A meddler.. A buffoon. You know nothing of war.\nDOCTOR: I’m all those things and less. But I know one thing: you don’t win a war by becoming the very thing you’re fighting. Tenebris — what Aliona did to you was monstrous. Appalling. But she’s gone. She escaped you. No matter how much you destroy, you can never have that revenge. Pursue the unobtainable, and you’11l never stop. Where does it end, Kylo, where does it end?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 135\nTENEBRIS: a\nDOCTOR: You can’t achieve vengeance. But maybe you can achieve justice.\nTENEBRIS: Justice?\nDOCTOR: For the Igris.\nTENEBRIS: (BEAT) What do you suggest?\nDOCTOR: Release your Drashani prisoners, Kylo. Send them back to the Empire with the truth. When the people know what’s been done in their name, they won’t allow it to continue. There’1ll be no more Igris. No more torture. The Empire will change. You can win.\nTENEBRIS: Win?\nDOCTOR: Yes! The only victory you can have!\nTENEBRIS: (BEAT) It seems you understand Prince Kylo at last, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (MODEST) Well, I’ve always been a rather good judge of character.\nTENEBRIS: .But you don’t know Tenebris at all.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nTENEBRIS: That sentimental fool would have set the souls of the Igris free. To me, they’re weapons, nothing more. I send them into battle. When they die, I create replacements.\nDOCTOR: But -\nTENEBRIS: You know how they say revenge is best served, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 136\nDOCTOR: I’ve heard this one. Just a moment, it’1l come to me. Ah yes... revenge is a frozen meal for one, not a finger-buffet to be shared?\nDOCTOR: Kylo! Please — listen to me!\nTENEBRIS: Goodbye, Doctor.\nCHENI: Kylo! Don’t do this!\nTENEBRIS: What?\nCHENTI: Kylo!\nTENEBRIS: (CONFUSED) Who are you?\nCHENT: Don’t you know me, Kylo? Don’t you know your lost love, your bride? I’ve found you at last... after so many years!\nTENEBRIS: Aliona?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 137\nBOMB: Eight. Seven. Six... (ETC)\nTEESHA: Here it comes...\nDUKHIN: I’ve changed my mind. This is a terrible idea.\nTEESHA: (DETERMINED) Too late. Don’t let go.\nBOMB: Three. Two. One.\nBOMB: (SWITCHES FLIP. A BULKHEAD OPENS TO SPACE. A RUSH OF AIR — LIKE A HURRICANE! )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 138\nCHENI: Kylo....\nTENEBRIS: No. No, you’re just a voice in the void. You could be anyone. Whoever you are, you are not Aliona. Everyone knows she died in the skies of Sharnax.\nCHENT: As you did?\nTENEBRIS: But...\nCHENT: I’1ll prove who I am, my love. I’1l tell you another story - a story of bravery, of love and loss. Perhaps you know it already?\nTENEBRIS: I...\nCHENT: Listen... and I’1l begin. Once upon a shining star, not so very long ago, there lived a courageous Knight of Sorsha. And he loved with all his heart a beautiful Gadarel maiden...\nCHENT: CROSS-FADE TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 139\nCHENI: And her name was Aliona...\nWRATH: This contradicts our records.\nWRATH LEADER: Scanning archives. Record found. Designation: Aliona Gadarel; Rank: Princess; Status: terminated.\nWRATH: Then the Drashani woman lies.\nWRATH LEADER: Truth bends. The Wrath will listen. And we will judge.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 140\nCHENI: (CONTINUING) ..The wicked men who wanted war believed they had won. They had kept Kylo and Aliona apart, and stopped the wedding that would have united the Empire. But they could not have imagined the strength of the young couple’s love for one another. A love that had already spanned three star-systems. Now, it reached across the very chasm of Death itself.\nTENEBRIS: No. That’s not how it happened.\nCHENT: Hush my darling. The story’s not done yet. (BEAT) Word of their passing spread through Drashani space — first in whispers, then in songs of sorrow and mourning. And the people rose up with one voice. They refused to fight another day. In memory of the tragic couple, they laid down their weapons. And the Great Houses were as one in mourning for Kylo and Aliona!\nTENEBRIS: That’s not how it happened! Shut up! SHUT UP!\nDOCTOR: That’s certainly not the way I remember things. But what is truth, if not the lies we tell ourselves? Is it really less believable than the notion an Empire’s annihilation can bring peace to a betrayed Prince?\nCHENT: I loved you, Kylo. I always loved you. You knew that once. But you’re so filled with hate now you’ve forgotten.\nKYLO: This is a trick, you told me. You told me it was a lie.\nALIONA: It’s not. Look into your heart. Think about what you feel.\nTENEBRIS: (LOSING IT) You’re lying to me again! Leave me alone! LEAVE ME ALONE!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 141\nCHENTI: Haven’t you been alone long enough? I want us to be together, Kylo. That’s all I ever wanted. Why won’t you believe me?\nTENEBRIS: Get away from me!\nDOCTOR: Well done. You drove her away. Again.\nTENEBRIS: You brought her here.\nDOCTOR: Of course I did. Isn’t that what you asked?\nTENEBRIS: I wanted revenge! She betrayed me!\nDOCTOR: She didn’t betray you. To do that, she’d have to care about you first. You were a pawn to be sacrificed.\nTENEBRIS: She said she loved me!\nDOCTOR: She was lying. Boy meets girl. Girl cuts boy’s hand off. Girl commits genocide. It’s the oldest story in the book.\nTENEBRIS: That’s not what happened! Aliona.. tell him that’s not what happened! Aliona! ALIONA!\nDOCTOR: She’s gone. You had your chance to tell her what she did to you — but you stuck your fingers in your ears until she went away. You're like some broken-hearted teenager. I suppose no-one ever really gets over their first crush.\nTENEBRIS: I've set worlds aflame!\nDOCTOR: For what? For the Igris? For revenge?\nTENEBRIS: (AGONISED ROAR) For HER!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 142\nDOCTOR: Touched a nerve, have I?\nDOCTOR: (TENEBRIS LUNGES. HANDS ROUND THE DOCTOR'S THROAT. THEY STRUGGLE! )\nCHENI: Doctor! He’s going to kill you!\nTENEBRIS: (WILD) I don’t care about the Drashani! This was never about revenge! You made me what I am, Aliona! I’ve burned worlds - for you!\nDOCTOR: (THEIR STRUGGLE GROWS MORE VIOLENT. TENEBRIS HAS THE UPPER HAND!\nSUDDENLY: - A SOUND LIKE TEARING PAPER. BIRDS’ WINGS FLAP. THEN... ROARING, RUSHING AIR; JUST LIKE SCENE 54.\nSUDDENLY: THE STRUGGLE STOPS. )\nTENEBRIS: (BREATHING HARD) Doctor? Doctor, where are you? (BEAT) He’s gone, Aliona! He’s - (BEAT) Aliona? Are you there? Aliona?\nTENEBRIS: ALIONAAAAA!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR'S YANKED BACK TO THE ‘REAL’ UNIVERSE FROM THE UNDERVOID. )\nWRATH: Your morality has been vindicated, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (STILL SHORT OF BREATH) I’m fine, thanks for asking.\nWRATH: Lord Deliverer Tenebris has rejected his doctrine of vengeance. The Wrath will do the same.\nDOCTOR: He liberated you, and you left him there... in that wasteland dimension.\nWRATH: Tenebris called us blank slates, Doctor. The purpose he gave us has been erased. We need new orders. We need new values.\nDOCTOR: You’re asking me to give your lives meaning?\nWRATH: That would require a god. We do not need a god. A programmer will suffice.\nDOCTOR: (CONSIDERS... THEN EXHALES LOUDLY ) Alright. Let’s see what we can do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 144\nTEESHA: This looks like a docking-corridor, Dukhin. I bet it leads to the Wrath flagship. (BEAT) Are you alright?\nDUKHIN: I’m fine.\nTEESHA: You look shaken.\nDUKHIN: Still getting my senses back. My ears are still ringing.\nTEESHA: If that bomb had been much bigger, I don’t think the explosive decompression would’ve saved us. We’d both be plastered all over the walls of the Avionics Nexus now.\nDUKHIN: Actually, I wasn’t talking about the bomb.\nTEESHA: (GRAVE) Dukhin. Listen very carefully. After we saved the station, I got overexcited, that’s all. I just needed a little stress-relief. It’s finished now, it’s forgotten. It will never happen again.\nDUKHIN: OK.\nTEESHA: If you ever tell anyone, I will hunt you down and kill you like a dog. Understand?\nDUKHIN: Yes.\nTEESHA: Good. Let’s find the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: (GLASS VIBRATING. THE DOCTOR'S TAPPING AWAY AT A KEYBOARD. TEESHA AND DUKHIN ENTER. )\nDOCTOR: Teesha!

Very good. Well, I’m sure you’d like to know what’s been happening since we were separated. The war’s over. The Wrath have abandoned their vendetta against the Drashani Empire.\nDUKHIN: That’s fantastic! How did you — ?\nDOCTOR: It’s a long story. Mostly involving my exceptional brilliance and courage. Anyway — the more pertinent point is that the Wrath have asked me to reprogramme them. I’ve just about...\nDOCTOR: .finished! Would you like to know what I’ve taught them?\nTEESHA: Do we have a choice?\nDOCTOR: Sarcasm is neither big nor clever, Teesha my dear. Your planet will no doubt reach that conclusion in a millennium or so.\nDUKHIN: (COUGHS) The Wrath, Doctor. What instructions did you give them?\nDOCTOR: (CLAPS) I’m very glad you asked, Dukhin. Under Tenebris, the Wrath were a scourge, trailing death and destruction across the cosmos. I’ve decided they’1ll become a force for peace instead. I’ve drawn upon a very reliable model for their new morality.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 146\nDUKHIN: What model?\nDOCTOR: Myself.\nTEESHA: (UNCONVINCED) Yourself?\nDOCTOR: (OFFENDED) Yes Teesha. Myself. With my programming in their cortices, the Wrath will respect every voice. They won’t judge; they’1l quietly observe, never interfering. Seek sensible and well-reasoned compromise wherever conflict arises. Just as I do. What could possibly go wrong?\nDOCTOR: Hmmph. Well, I suppose you want to get back to Cawdor?\nTEESHA: That would be good.\nDOCTOR: I’1l drop you off in the TARDIS. After that, I’ve a little errand to run.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: (ROARING GALES, WORDLESS MOANING VOICES. THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. THE DOCTOR EMERGES. )\nTENEBRIS: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Prince Kylo.\nTENEBRIS: How did you get here?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it was simplicity itself. It took some rather careful recalibration of the TARDIS’ materialisation circuits, but then I am exceptionally clever... Are you alone?\nTENEBRIS: Aliona’s gone. Gone forever. Somewhere in the void... among the voices.\nDOCTOR: You have to let her go, you know that.\nTENEBRIS: I know.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Speaking of going. Are you going to come with me?\nTENEBRIS: What? Why?\nDOCTOR: Did you think I was going to leave you to die alone in this Undervoid? You’ve suffered quite enough for one lifetime, I think.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 148\nDOCTOR WHO: (UNSPOILED COUNTRYSIDE. BIRDS TWEET, LEAVES RUSTLE, A STREAM BABBLES. TARDIS MATERIALISES. THE DOCTOR AND KYLO EMERGE. )\nTENEBRIS: I knew it wasn’t Aliona, you know. Right from the start.\nDOCTOR: Of course you did.\nTENEBRIS: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere safe.\nTENEBRIS: Rolling hills, blue skies. It’s beautiful. Living out my days alone here is a far more fragrant sentence than exile in the Undervoid.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t a punishment. You won’t be alone, Prince Kylo of Sorsha.\nTENEBRIS: If there’s civilisation anywhere on this planet, Doctor, I see no sign of it.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you? Take another look. Just a degree or two to your right.\nTENEBRIS: I really don’t [see] — (STARTLED) Whoah!\nTENEBRIS: (WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING, THE IDYLLIC COUNTRYSIDE’S GONE —\nREPLACED: BY A BUSTLING CITYSCAPE! TRAFFIC, HONKING HORNS,\nRATTLING: TRAINS, PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. LIKE THE NEW YORK RUSH- HOUR! )\nDOCTOR: See what I mean?\nDOCTOR: (THE CITYSCAPE NOISES DISAPPEAR AGAIN — BACK TO THE PEACEFUL IDYLL. KYLO’S HYPERVENTILATING; RECOVERING FROM THE SHOCK. )\nTENEBRIS: What was that? Did I imagine it? Did you see it too?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 149\nDOCTOR: Try it again.\nDOCTOR: (THE SAME EFFECT — IDYLLIC COUNTRYSIDE > CITYSCAPE RUSH-HOUR. THEN, A MOMENT LATER, ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT; THIS TIME, CRASHING\nOCEAN: WAVES. AND THEN — IN QUICK SUCCESSION — A STRING OF OTHER\nALIEN: WORLDS, EACH UTTERLY DIFFERENT TO THE LAST.\nALIEN: FINALLY, BACK TO THE ROLLING HILLS AND TWEETING BIRDS...)\nDOCTOR: Welcome to the Cagliostro Prismosphere, Prince Kylo.\nTENEBRIS: Pardon?\nDOCTOR: The Cagliostro Prismosphere. A little corner of reality where thousands of worlds have become squashed together in the same Space-time. Layers of existence, all folded and overlaid on one another.\nTENEBRIS: That’s crazy.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s inevitably going to happen somewhere. People tend to think the universe is neat and tidy. It isn’t. It’s more like that dusty attic you keep meaning to get sorted but somehow never get around to. Shift your perspective by the merest fraction of a degree within the prismosphere, you’re in another world.\nTENEBRIS: I had no idea such a thing could be possible.\nDOCTOR: There are moons of fire and ice here. Vistas of pure thought, and at least one planet where the locals communicate via the medium of seafood. I wouldn’t recommend that one. It tends to get a little ripe during times of national celebration. (GRAVE) You'll find it very easy to get yourself lost here... and very easy to stay undetected.\nTENEBRIS: It’s thirty years since I breathed the air of my homeworld. What if I decide to go back?\nDOCTOR: If you take my advice, you’1ll forget about the Drashani Empire. And if you do choose to leave the prismosphere someday, I’d advise keeping several star-systems out of their way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 150\nTENEBRIS: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve shown me humanity I never earned.\nDOCTOR: I remember the man you were Kylo. The man I let down. Oh, that reminds me. One more thing. A souvenir. Something from your past.\nDOCTOR: (JEWELLERY GLISTENS — THE SAME TWINKLY SOUND EFFECT WE HEARD IN PART ONE. )\nTENEBRIS: The Royal Carcanet! From Aliona’s wedding jewellery.\nDOCTOR: Not exactly a reminder of happy times, I know. But I wondered if you might like to keep it?\nTENEBRIS: Memories of sorrow and loss. I’ve spent decades trying to put them behind me, Doctor. I’m ready to embrace them now.\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Kylo. I hope you’1ll find the peace you’ve been denied.\nDOCTOR: (THE TARDIS DOOR CLOSES. IT DEMATERIALISES... LEAVING JUST THE BIRDS, THE LEAVES, AND THE STREAM. )\nTENEBRIS: Goodbye Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE CASTLE KEEP. MERCHANTS, PEASANTS, FARM ANIMALS. OLERIK WALKS, ATTENDED BY HER ARMOURED WARRIORS. )\nOLERIK: Now remember. No spitting. No belching. No picking your nose. You may be barbaric nomads of the Cawdor plains, but there’1l be grief if you don’t act civilised in there. Got it?\nNOMADS: Yes clan-mother.\nOLERIK: Good. Now, when we get in, I want —\nDOCTOR: Olerik! You’re alive! Splendid!\nOLERIK: ‘Course I’m alive. The Drashani sent another starcruiser to pick up their delegation. So muggins here’s got to renegotiate the treaty for the Galdrium before they all pack up and go.\nDOCTOR: I certainly wouldn’t want to be in their shoes.\nOLERIK: Come with me. I could use a good advisor right now.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’ll do fine without me getting in your way. Actually, I’m looking for Dukhin and Teesha. Have you seen them?\nOLERIK: Try the Drashani shuttle landing site. Now if you’1ll excuse me, I’ve some diplomacy to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 152\nDUKHIN: There’s no trace of the Wrath left on Cawdor, Doctor. And their fleet’s disappeared from orbit. Lot of clearing up to do down here, though.\nDOCTOR: A lot of bodies to be buried.\nDUKHIN: You freed the Wrath from Tenebris, Doctor. From his hunger for revenge. If we’re the last world that suffers at their hands, maybe the deaths achieved something.\nDOCTOR: That’s a positive way to look at things, Dukhin Stubbs. So... when will you be leaving for Gadarel Prime? Looks like the shuttle’s almost loaded.\nTEESHA: He’s not leaving, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You’re not?\nDUKHIN: I’ve decided to stay on Cawdor. Teesha asked me to marry her. Olerik’s going to conduct the ceremony.\nTEESHA: No, Dukhin. The clans of Cawdor don’t marry. We’re to be bound in a ritual pact of mutual sacrifice that will endure until one of us no longer draws breath.\nDUKHIN: That’s what I said... married.\nTEESHA: You should come, Doctor. There’1ll be ale, vats of jellied palarmies, and fatted storbucks broiled in the juices of their new-born calves...\nDUKHIN: There'll be a vegetarian option too.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 153\nTEESHA: Please Doctor. Let Cawdor offer the hospitality we failed to show you when you first arrived.\nDOCTOR: Oh, alright. Why not? The Drashani Empire’s still in one piece, the threat of Tenebris is ended, and the Wrath have become a force for peace and order in the universe. Just this once, I think I’ve earned a party.\nCLOSING: THEME\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: (RAUCOUS, SLEAZY DIVE. SYNTHY RIFF ON COWBOY SALOON MUSIC TINKLES IN THE BACKGROUND. THE DOORS BANG OPEN.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SALOON GOES SILENT... A STRANGER’S BOOTS MARCH TO THE BAR.)\nBARKEEP: (WARY) This is exclusive establishment! We no get many new faces. What is it you want here.\nSTRANGER: Wantin’ a drink, barkeep. If that ain’t an inconvenience to you.\nSTRANGER: (A GLASS SLAMS DOWN ON THE BAR. BOOZE GLUGS INTO IT. THE\nSTRANGER: KNOCKS IT BACK. GASPS. )\nBARKEEP: You making my regulars nervous. They no like strangers. You should leave.\nSTRANGER: Well now... could be I’m just a friend they ain’t met yet. See, I heard tell there’s folks here willing to buy a thing without gettin all caught up in where that thing mighta come from. Is that right?\nBARKEEP: I think you fit right in.\nSTRANGER: I got me a batch o’ Metebelis Mindstones burnin’ a hole in my saddlebag. You know anyone here who [might] — ?\nSTRANGER: (FROM NOWHERE, THE BUZZ OF THE WRATHS’ GESTALT MIND! THE SALOON\nGOES: QUIET AGAIN. )\nWRATH: The Mindstones in your bag were received from the war criminal Kylo Sorsha, as payment for passage from the Cagliostro Prismosphere. You will tell us his intended destination.\nSTRANGER: What in the twelve systems are - ?\nWRATH: We are the Wrath. We are a force for peace and order in the universe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ACHERON PULSE by Rick Briggs (003) Page 155\nBARKEEP: This respectable establishment! No trouble here!\nWRATH: The Wrath do not cause trouble. We do not judge, we simply observe.\nSTRANGER: Observe this, you faceless freaks.\nWRATH: A weapon. Your lack of cooperation has been noted. The\nWRATH: Mindstones are valuable. They were obtained illegally.\nSTRANGER: That’s my business, mister. Wanna make something of it?\nSTRANGER: (A WRATH FLAMEBOLT! THE STRANGER BURSTS INTO FLAMES - HE SCREAMS AND DIES! A BEAT. THEN THE SALOON MUSIC STARTS UP AGAIN. )\nBARKEEP: You fellows want drink?\nBARKEEP: END OF ‘THE ACHERON PULSE’"
