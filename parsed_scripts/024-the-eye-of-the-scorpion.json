      "searchable_dialogue": "YANIS: Damn this. Where is he?\nYANIS: Another voice speaks - HOREMSHEP (High Priest of Horus and leader of the Council of Priests in Thebes), though he’s not identified as such yet and the wind disguises his voice.\nHOREMSHEP: Yanis.\nYANIS: Finally. I thought you had got lost in the sandstorm.\nHOREMSHEP: Not this close to Thebes. YANIS A temple-rat like you could get lost in his own tunic. If\nHOREMSHEP: I didn’t need you I would tear your head from your scrawny shoulders.\nHOREMSHEFP: Are your troops in place?\nYANIS: They fear me too much to be anything else.\nHOREMSHEP: Good. Come with me. I found something on the way here. Something important.\nYANIS: What is it?\nHOREMSHEP: You will see.\nYANIS: Hurry, then. Our plans will be ruined if you are missed in the city.\nHOREMSHEP: Here. By my chariot. Take a closer look. Open it.\nYANIS: That? That is worth risking everything for? I swear, if\nYANIS: this is a trick... Sound of a metal hinge opening, followed by a bizarre scrabbling and scratching sound. The sound gets louder.\nYANIS: &. Inside the Temple at Thebes.\nYANIS: FAYUM, a young priest is observing the stars and tutting. He is joined by ANTRANAK, head of the temple guards and Egypt's armies. They are friends but talk as if at war — baiting each other. If their tone wasn’t friendly, you'd think they loathed each other.\nFAYUM: This is not good. Not good at all.\nANTRANAK: Still muttering and watching the night skies, Fayum? How are the omens? No, don’t tell me - they’re bad.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM The gods send signs in the skies that speak only of terrible things to come, Antranak.\nANTRANAK: Nonsense. We are safe inside Pharaoh's own palace with my troops on constant guard. Nothing can harm us here.\nFAYUM: We shall see.\nANTRANAK: Sometimes I wonder what you priests are taught. Still, the Gods’ ways are not mine to question. I am only a soldier. Good night, Fayum. ANTRANAR’s footsteps echo into the distance.\nPAYUM: (Softly) I fear we have very few good nights ahead of us.\nPAYUM: 3. TARDIS interior. The Fifth DOCTOR is giving PERI a tour of his ship. A door closes as they enter a corridor.\nPAYUM: PERI And that’s the small library?\nPAYUM: DOCTOR The big one’s up ahead.\nPERI: I can’t believe there’s more. We’ve been wandering these corridors for hours.\nDOCTOR: I thought you wanted to know your way around.\nPERI: I do, believe me, but I lost my bearings six corridors, three floors and two hours ago.\nDOCTOR: It just takes a little getting used to, that’s all. You’ll know your way about in no time.\nPERI: So you really know what all these doors are?\nDOCTOR: Naturally. For instance, this is the main library.\nDOCTOR: He opens the door and we hear waves crashing on the shore.\nDOCTOR: PERI The books are going to get wet.\nDOCTOR: He shuts the door.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Of course, sometimes the TARDIS moves things about. Still, not to worry. A littie redecorating never hurt anybody.\nDOCTOR: PERI A little redecorating? You've got a lake in there.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. I much preferred it where it was. Where to next?\nPERI: I don’t suppose you've got a restaurant stashed away here? My stomach thinks my throat’s been cut.\nDOCTOR: There should be a food machine around here somewhere.\nDOCTOR: I haven't used it much recently.\nDOCTOR: He ig interrupted by the sound of the TARDIS lurching and being buffeted and thrown about. He and PERI are thrown about. They thump into walis loudly.\nPERI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Grab onto something.\nDOCTOR: More lurching and then it subsides.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s passed.\nPERI: It feels so hot, suddenly...\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s 2 bit worrying. Come on. This way. DOCTOR's footsteps hurry off along the corridor.\nPERI: (Mutters) I'm fine thanks. How are you?\nDOCTOR: (Calling) Peri...\nPERI: Slow down. I don’t want to get lost in this...\nPERI: er footsteps follow the DOCTOR’s through a door. The Console Room ums.\nPERI: How can the Console Room be here? We’ve gone down three flight of stairs and...”\nDOCTOR: Sssh.\nPERI: Do...\nDOCTOR: Ssssh. Ah.\nDOCTOR: PERI From that ‘Ah!’ I take it I don’t have to ask if you know what happened.\nDOCTOR: We've materialised. The TARDIS has been reprogrammed.\nPERI: By who? Is there somebody else on board?\nDOCTOR: I'm just checking. Oh. That can't be right. According to the\nDOCTOR: 8\nDOCTOR: TARDIS, she was reprogrammed by me.\nPERI: That’s impossible. We were stuck in the middle of this flying rabbit warren.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it does seem more than a little odd.\nPERI: Where are we going now?\nDOCTOR: dust a short hop it seems. A few million miles to the side\nDOCTOR: and a couple of days back. Oh. We’re almost there.\nPERI: One day soon, you're gonna have to teach me how these controls work.\nDOCTOR: (Not entirely convinced by the idea) Perhaps. Let’s see where we are first.\nDOCTOR: The wind blows, and is then interrupted by the TARDIS materialisation noise. The door opens and PERI hurries out of the TARDIS after the DOCTOR.\nPERI: So where are we?\nPERI: DOCTOR From the gravity and atmosphere (sniffs) I'd say Earth. No industrial by-products in the air? Definitely Barth. Egypt, roughly 1400BC.*\nPERI: Oh, come on. Even you can’t tell all that from the air.\nDOCTOR: True, but the hieroglyphs on the wall of the house behind the TARDIS are a bit of a giveaway.\nPERI: Smart guy. What do they say anyway?\nDOCTOR: They're prayers to ward off evil and protect the house.\nDOCTOR: A door rattles on its hinges in the wind.\nPERI: Whoever lived here didn’t have much faith in their prayers, The place is abandoned. A few jars, some rope, bits of pottery, some clothes and an old wheel...\nDOCTOR: (Over Perf) Hmm. Very interesting. (Thoughtfuh Can you hear something?\nPERI: Like what?\nPERI: A young woman (17) is yelling and shouting for her horses to step. Her chariot is a runaway. She is ERIMEM. The horses snort and the chariot clatters.\nERIMEM: Help me!\nDOCTOR: Like that.\nPERI: Her chariot’s out of control.\nDOCTOR: There's another chariot. She’s being chased. All through we hear ERIMEM and her horses getting closer.\nPERI: He's more than chasing her.\nDOCTOR: Behind the TARDIS. Quickly.\nDOCTOR: Arrows zing through the air and thud into the TARDIS. ERIMEM is still trying to stop her horses.\nERIMEM: Stop! Slow down. Stop!\nPERI: We have to do something.\nDOCTOR: I’m thinking.\nPERI: Think faster. They’re almost on top of us.\nDOCTOR: He's can’t drive and use his bow accurately at the same time... Grab that rope over there. Tie one end round the TARDIS.\nPERI: What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Take the other end to the far side of the breach in the wall and yank it tight after the first chariot is through.\nPERI: This stuff’s so slippery. It’s coated with some kind of oil.\nERIMEM: Steady. Steady.\nDOCTOR: Over here. This way. Peri, are you ready?\nPERI: Nearly.\nDOCTOR: Hurry. She's almost through. Quickly.\nDOCTOR: The pounding of the horses is almost on top of them.\nPERI: There. Done. She’s through. Pull it. Tight.\nPERI: The sound of the rope going taught and then a shocked yell, followed by the sound of 4 man in armour hitting the ground hard.\nPERI: We got him.\nPERI: The fallen man (a scout named KISHIK) groans. ERIMEM is yelling for her horses to stop.\nERIMEM: Stop. Slow now. Stop. Whoa.\nERIMEM: No use. The horses thunder on.\nDOCTOR: Her horses have been scared out of their wits. She can’t control them. Keep an eye on our friend there.\nPERI: What?\nDOCTOR: I don’t have time to argue. Someone has to stop those\nDOCTOR: horses. Tell your friend I borrowed his chariot for a few minutes.\nDOCTOR: The sound of the reins being flicked and the chariot moving off again.\nDOCTOR: Hya.\nDOCTOR: The fallen KISHIK groans and mumbles.\nKISHIK: Wha...?\nPERI: T hope this isn’t an antique.\nPERI: The sound of a pottery jar being smashed over KISHIK ’s head. Another groan and he hits the dirt hard for the second time in under a minute.\nPERI: Sorry.\nPERI: 8. Bxt. Desert.\nPERI: Out in the desert, the DOCTOR's chariot is chasing ERIMEM’s. If we could see them the horses would be sweating up & foam as they charge across the desert. Their hooves are pounding loudly and they are brea’ heavily. There are two sets of chariot and horse sounds. The DOCTOR’s chariot is heavier and clatters more.\nDOCTOR: Hya. HYA!\nBRIMEM: WHOA. SLOW DOWN. STOP!\nDOCTOR: T'm almost there.\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR’s chariot sounds are merging with ERIMEM's. They are now very close.\nERIMEM: Help me.\nDOCTOR: Hang on.\nERIMEM: Hurry.\nDOCTOR: You'll have to step across.\nERIMEM: T can’t.\nDOCTOR: Your horses are too frightened to stop. There’s no\nDOCTOR: ouetnenive Cin almost there. Just a little closer.\nDOCTOR: In top of the horses’ snorting and pounding hooves, the sound of wheels touching and sparks flying. Both ERIMEM and the DOCTOR yelp. DOCTOR A little too close. Gently. Gently. Now. Step across.\nDOCTOR: 10\nERIMEM: I can't.\nDOCTOR: You have to. Hurry, I can't hold the chariots this close for long. Take my hand. Take it! Now jump. It’s just one step. Step now.\nDOCTOR: The sound of ERIMEM leaping over and landing on the DOCTOR's chariot.\nDOCTOR: Got you. It’s all right. I've got you. Whoa now. Whoa. The chariot pulls to a stop.\nDOCTOR: Are you hurt?\nBEIMEM: Stay away from me.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right. Pm not going to hurt you. Though I can’t say a same for the chap I borrowed this chariot from.* Where is he?\nDOCTOR: Back there with a friend of mine. Unconscious. Good. Get me away from here.\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you'd care to tell me why he was trying to kill you? You don’t know?\nDOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn’t ask, would I? You are a stranger here.\nDOCTOR: Weil, ’'ve been to Egypt before but I don’t think I’ve been recently,\nERIMEM: Take me to Thebes.\nDOCTOR: You haven't answered my question.\nERIMEM: When we are safe in Thebes, I will answer all your questions. Just get me there.\nDOCTOR: All right. Hold on. Hup. Giddup.\nDOCTOR: The horses pull the chariot away.\nDOCTOR: 6. In the desert, by the TARDIS. The DOCTOR’s chariot pulls up by PERL\nPERI: Doctor, 'm glad you're back.\nDOCTOR: Whoa.\nDOCTOR: See eens Another pot smashes and he hits the ground bard again. That's my last pot.\nDOCTOR: Loonoa You enjoyed that too much, young lady.\nDOCTOR: SRIME! I hoped he would be dead\nDOCTOR: T think that’s rather harsh, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: TRIBE] I owe him and his kind a hundred times worse.\nPERI: ‘You got her, then.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nPERI: So who is she? And why was this guy trying to mill her?\nPERI: T thought he might have been a bandit but that's battle armour he's wearing.\nDOCTOR: Yes. 1 spotted that as well. And whoever this is, she’s too afraid to talk here. She's almost in shock. We'll take her to Thebes. She's sure she'll be safe there.\" And we might get. some answers.\nPERI: What about him? Four of us on that chariot is going to be\nPERI: cramped.\nDOCTOR: These war chariots were built for two passengers and a driver. Leave your sleeping friend there. He'll be all right in a minute or two, apart from a terrible headache.\nERIMEM: Others of his kind are bound to be close by now. We must leave at once.\nERIMEM: it\nDOCTOR: That might be a good idea. I've had more than enough excitement for one day.\nDOCTOR: PERI And we still don’t know what brought us here.\nDOCTOR: One crisis at a time, Peri. One crisis at a time. 7. The desert.\nDOCTOR: Another squadron of chariots pulls to a stop. In one is YANIS. He’s not best pleased at the DOCTOR’s rescue of ERIMEM. In the far distance we hear the DOCTOR'’s chariot clatter away.\nYANIS: Stop. Stop. We'll never catch them before they reach Thebes. Their archers would slaughter us as we approached. Damn you, Stranger. Where did you come from?\nYANIS: 8. Thebes.\nYANIS: The chariot rattles and chunters towards Thebes.\nDOCTOR: Here we are, Peri. Thebes.\nPERI: I didn’t expect it to be so huge.\nDOCTOR: Yes, impressive, isn’t it?\nPERI: If Howard could see me now. He always complained that I didn't share his interest in history.\nDOCTOR: Where to?\nDOCTOR: ERIMEM The palace.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? This is an enemy chariot, I don’t think they'll exactly welcome us with open arms.\nERIMEM: That will not be a problem, Doctor.\nPERI: Doctor... have you noticed the people...\nDOCTOR: .are all kneeling?\nDOCTOR: PERI And bowing. And generally grovelling.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. I don’t think you told us exactly who you are.\nERIMEM: No. I did not. Stand proud and firm. Show that nothing has happened to harm us.\nPERI: We've got company.\nDOCTOR: So I see. Whoa there. Whoa.\nDOCTOR: The chariot halts. More chariots rattle to join them.\nPERI: I don't like the look of those swords, Doctor.\nPERI: ee I’m not too keen on the spears either. Best behaviour,\nANTRANAK: Mighty one. We sing praises to the Gods for your safe return.\nPERI: Mighty one?\nPERI: When ERIMEM speaks now there is a change in her. She is strong and firm. Regal.\nERIMEM: Escort us to the palace, Antranak. We have a great deal to do but this is not the place to do it.\nERIMEM: As you command, mighty Pharaoh.\nERIMEM: aoe Pharaoh? CcTOR I must be getting old. I thought I knew the names of all or Egypt's pharaohs. a\nERIMEM: Should I be bowing or curtsying or something?\nERIMEM: Yes, but please refrain from doing so. The chariot is quite\nERIMEM: 12\nERIMEM: small — and it would be very unseemly for a friend of Pharaoh to fall off in public.\nPERI: Whatever you say.\nERIMEM: I would wager, Doctor, that you did not expect anything like this when you first saw my chariot being chased.\nDOCTOR: Er, not really, no.\nDOCTOR: Mi But I think the unexpected is something you are familiar with. Am I right?\nDOCTOR: I was under the impression that divine Pharaoh is always right.\nERIMEM: (Laughs) I’m yet to actually be crowned Doctor, but when\nERIMEM: I have been, I think I would do well to avoid sparring in word games with you. Now smile and wave to the people. We have been victorious.\nERIMEM: 9. Yanis’s Camp.\nYANIS: is not best pleased. He's in a fouler than usual mood.\nYANIS: So. You are the spineless pig who let the whelp of a girl escape?® Do you have an explanation as to how the Egyptian pup escaped from a squadron of over a dozen chariots? Make your answer good, Kishik, or I will stake you in the sand and watch the buzzards feast on your eyes and innards.\nYANIS: It wasn’t my fault, sire. I plead for mercy.\nYANIS: Save your pleading, dung-beetle. I want answers. How did she escape?\nKISHIK: She had a large escort. Six... No, ten chariots. We killed all the rest — we even got her driver.\nKISHIK: YANIS. And still she escaped? Imbecile! Worse - coward!\nKISHIK: No, Lord Yanis. She had help.\nYANIS: What help?\nKISHIK: Arman with fair hair and strange clothing... And a violent\nKISHIK: girl who repeatedly struck me even when I was unable to defend myself.\nYANIS: (Roaring - the pretence is gone) I know — I saw her. I saw ital. A girl should be no match for a man - or even you. Tell me about the man.\nKISHIK: I barely saw him, sire. I only know that he knocked me from my chariot as if my magic.\nYANIS: Not magic, idiot - rope. But he handled the chariot like a true warrior. The brat’s horses were running as though they had demons at their tails but he took our chariot and caught them easily. I've never seen better.\nKISHIK: Except for you, of course, mighty Yanis.\nYANIS: (Sneering at the grovelling, then thoughtful.) Of course. Even at speed he pulled the girl onto his chariot with one hand. My gut tells me he is a dangerous enemy.\nKISHIK: Let me take a party into Thebes to kill him.\nYANIS: If I sent anyone to do that, it would be someone I could trust to follow orders. And you were ordered not to attack the Egyptian chariots until I arrived.\nKISHIK: But they would have escaped if I had waited any longer. YaNIs What has happened is that now that unbedded whelp who calls herself Pharaoh knows that we are here and she knows that we will\nKISHIK: 13\nKISHIK: attack sooner rather than later. I think I should slit you open and let the dogs feed. You’re worse than useless.® ;\nKISHIK: No, great Yanis. Mercy, please. I have a wife and four children at home. Let me live. I will not fail you again. I am loyal. I have always been loyal to you.\nKISHIK: YANIS And to my predecessor. As I remember, you helped me murder him. I will let you live, Kishik, but at a price.\nKISHIK: Anything. I'll do anything...\nYANIS: I know you will. Come through here. My private shrine is in the back of this tent.\nKISHIK: I am unworthy, lord.\nKISHIK: Sound of them moving through.\nKISHIK: It is dark. I can’t see.\nYANIS: Here, I'll bring a light.\nKISHIK: What? Nol There fs an insect-like skittering sound - like thousands of insects milling about over each other.\nKISHIK: NO! SAVE ME!\nKISHIK: screams and then is quiet - only the insect skittering sound. YANIS At least now you may be useful.\nKISHIK: 4A knock at the door.\nERIMEM: Come.\nERIMEM: Door opens and ANTRANAK enters.\nANTRANAK: Pharaoh.\nBRIMEM: You have news, Antranak?\nANTRANAK: Yes, Highness. I sent a chariot squadron to the area of the desert where you were attacked. The bodies of our men were recovered. They will be buried with honour and their souls will find rest.\nERIMEM: Good. Meanwhile, I have ordered a banquet to thank the strangers who saved me today. I will need my friend there.\nANTRANAK: As you command. Majesty. (A little uncertainiy) You do these strangers a great honour with this banquet.\nERIMEM: No more than they have earned.\nANTRANAK: True. But what do we know of them?\nBRIMEM: Only that they risked their lives to save mine without\nBRIMEM: knowing who or what I was. You don't trust them?\nANTRANAK: I don't know them. Majesty, but they arrived at a fortunate time for you. f\nERIMEM: For which I am grateful.\nANTRANAK: As am I. Perhaps I have been a soldier too long, but good luck like this makes me suspicious. Especially when my Pharaoh's safety is in question.\nANTRANAK: (Kindly - this is a friend) We have all had enough bad fortune this year, Antranak. Let us celebrate what good luck we can.\nANTRANAK: I will be at the banquet as you wish. With your permission, I will go and prepare myself.\nANTRANAK: ERIMEM Of course.\nANTRANAK: Door clases behind ANTRANAK.\nANTRANAK: speaks to the soldiers on guard outside ERIMEM’s suite as he comes through the door.\nANTRANAK: Soldier. Double the guard on Great Pharaoh's chambers\nANTRANAK: Sir.\nANTRANAK: ANTRANAK And set others near the quarters of the pair who came into the city with Pharaoh, but don’t make it obvious. There’s no need for them to know we’re watching them.\nANTRANAK: 12. The Palace at Thebes.\nANTRANAK: The DOCTOR is calling for PERI - a tad impatiently.\nDOCTOR: Peri, are you ready yet?\nPERI: TP be out in a minute.\nDOCTOR: Do try to hurry. It’s considered bad form to keep the ruler of the known world waiting in her own palace.\nPERI: Okay, okay. Here I come, ready or not. Well? What do you think?\nDOCTOR: You've been busy.”\nPERI: Not me. I’ve had half a dozen servants helping me bathe, get this dress on, put this stuff on my eyes...\nDOCTOR: Kohl. It’s used to make the sloe-eye shape.\nDOCTOR: PERI At least you didn’t have servants trying to shave your head.\nDOCTOR: Well, it is their custom for people to have bald heads and\nDOCTOR: wear wigs. Much cooler in the heat, apparently.\nPERI: Can we see the pyramids from here? I’ve always wanted to see them. And the Sphinx.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. Thebes is quite a way from Giza. If we were in the Royal Palace at Memphis it would be a different story. Shall we?\nPERI: Is something wrong? You look a bit, I don’t know - edgy.\nDOCTOR: Just hoping my memory's playing up, that’s all. I can name every Pharaoh Egypt ever had and I'm certain there was never a Pharaoh Erimem.\nPERI: She's due to be crowned in a few weeks. You must be wrong. Maybe you just forgot her.\nDOCTOR: Female pharaohs were a rarity, Peri. I’m not likely to forget one. Hatchepsut... Smenkhare... No. Something must happen to stop Erimem being crowned.\nDOCTOR: PERI And now we have to go and have a banquet with her,\nDOCTOR: knowing that she never gets to be Pharaoh? You really know how to kill\nDOCTOR: an evening, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: There are the sounds of a crowd gathering. Low talking and muted music.\nFAYUM: You look worried, Antranak. Of course, you always look ‘worried.\nANTRANAK: I'm in no mood for your humour today, Fayum.\nANTRANAK: 15\nFAYUM: I fear your mood is about to get worse.\nFAYUM: They are joined by HOREMSHEP.\nHOREMSHEP: Greetings to you both.\nANTRANAK: What do you want, Horemshep?\nHOREMSHEP: Does the Priest of Horus need a reason for speaking to the head of the palace guard? ;\nANTRANAK: You never do anything without a reason. What is it this time?\nHOREMSHEP: Nothing. What do you know of the strangers Pharaoh honours with this banquet?\nANTRANAK: Only what my Pharaoh tells me. That is enough — for anyone. Even the chief of priests.\nANTRANAK: HOREMSHEP Of course. But still, I am curious.\nANTRANAK: Then question Pharaoh and leave me be.\nHOREMSHEP: Surely you're not jealous of Pharaoh’s new friends, Antranak? She has never honoured you with a banquet. But then, you haven't saved her life either.\nANTRANAK: 1 warn you, priest...\nFAYUM: (Butting in) If you are so interested in Pharaoh’s guests, Horemshep, why not ask them? They have just arrived.\nFAYUM: A little fanfare heralds the entrance of PERI and the DOCTOR.\nHOREMSHEP: Perhaps later. Gentiemen.\nHOREMSHEP: HOREMSHEP’s footsteps head away.\nFAYUM: Why does he constantly bait you, Antranak?\nANTRANAK: Because I have almost as much influence in the palace as he does and that eats away at him. But I should know better than to rise to his bait. And now I have duties to perform.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM OF course.\nANTRANAK: 13a. Int. Palace. The rumblings of the large gathering. Lots of chatter. Muted\nANTRANAK: conversations as if we're moving through the great hall until we get to the DOCTOR and PERI.\nPERI: Is this party all for us, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think we're on.\nANTRANAK: (Grandly) The great and mighty queen, daughter of the stars. Pharaoh in the eyes of the Gods and soon to be crowned, all bow to Erimemushinteperem, divine and eternal, the living god.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Peri, kneel.\nPERI: (Muttering - struggling a bit) I'd like to see you kneel wearing a dress this tight.\nDOCTOR: Ssh.\nERIMEM: Rise and approach, Doctor. And you, Peri.\nERIMEM: Slight delay while the footsteps of the DOCTOR and PERI approach the throne.\nERIMEM: ERIMEM The Doctor and Peri have done great service to your Pharaoh and to Egypt. As thanks, Doctor, I give you this cartouche\nERIMEM: bearing my divine name. It marks you as friend of Pharaoh and under my divine protection.\nDOCTOR: You do us great honour, mighty Pharaoh.\nDOCTOR: 16\nBRIMEM: Now let the banquet begin. A walloping great gong.\nERIMEM: You will sit by Pharaoh, Doctor. poem Thank you. Absolutely, your Majesty.\nANTRANAR: speaks to FAYUM, renewing their banter.\nFAYUM: Nice speech, Antranak.\nANTRANAK: This is a strange day, Fayum. An outsider sitting at Pharaob's right hand.\nANTRANAK: FayumM Pharaoh makes her own decisions. ANTRANAK And some do not like them? PAYUM To say that would be to admit treason. Everyone knows\nANTRANAK: that divine Pharaoh is infallible.\nANTEBANAK: Not everyone shares your opinion.

He's chief of the council of priests.-~\nPERI: Just joking. Those other topless girls — are they the next dancers?\nDOCTOR: Ab... well no.

Just push it round your plate. he\nDOCTOR: Sounds of a servant dishing up from a platter. His accent is not local.\nSLAVE: You want more boar, lady?\nPERI: No thanks. I don’t want to pig out. That’s not meant to be a bad pig joke. Sorry.\nSLAVE: (Confused) Lady?\nPERI: Never mind.\nSLAVE: Lord?\nDOCTOR: I don’t mind if I do.

No harm done.\nPERI: (Quietly) The waiter’s not very good, is he?\nDOCTOR: No. His clothes don’t quite fit him either, come to that.\nERIMEM: No more boar for me.\nERIMEM: Scraping on the plate.\nERIMEM: I said...\nERIMEM: Sound of a heavy plate being thrown aside.\nSLAVE: Death to Erimem!\nDOCTOR: No!\nPERI: Doctor!\nPERI: Yells and noises of confusion and struggle, including a cry of pain from the DOCTOR.\nERIMEM: You have saved me again, Doctor.\nPERI: You're bleeding.\nDOCTOR: (Obviously in a bit of pain) It’s nothing much.

I’m not privy to the thought of killers. °\nPAYUM: It will be the gossip of Thebes within the hour.\nANTRANAK: = I don’t doubt it.\nFAYUM: Then you must discover what he meant by true Pharaoh.'”\nANTRANAK: I don’t need a junior priest telling me what I have to do. Ihave been commander of the palace armies since long before you came to the royal court.\nFAYUM: I meant no disrespect, Commander.\nANTRANAK: I know. I didn’t mean to speak so harshly. FAYUM The last year has seen great unrest and turmoil in\nANTRANAK: Egypt.'® The sudden death of our beloved Pharaoh coupled with the other tragedies uf our royal house have caused great distress to our people. This rumour will only make matters worse. And it will be used by those in the council of priests who oppose Erimem’s coronation.\nANTRANAK: You will do what you can in council to quash this ridiculous idea.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM Of course. If you will excuse me.'® I think the Doctor has need of my training as a physician.\nANTRANAK: breathes out heavily.\nANTRANAK: 14, Yanis’s Camp. A tent flap opens. KISHIK enters.\nKISHIK: Mighty Yanis, word has come from Thebes...\nKISHIK: YANIS The Pharaoh girl is alive. I know, Kishik.\nKISHIK: How can you know...?\nYANIS: I know everything, idiot. I knew this plan wouldn't work.\nYANIS: But at least Erimem’s new champion is dead.\nYANIS: 15. The House Of Death. The House of Death — the temple for torturing prisoners, sounds dank, depressing and violent. There are crackling torches, scraping metal\nYANIS: blades and lots of agonised screams. There’s the sizzle of burning flesh followed sharpish by a loud scream.\nANTRANAK: Talk. Tell me who sent you to kill Pharaoh at the banquet? Who is your master?\nANTRANAK: Lots of whimpering from the prisoner but no answer.\nANTRANAK: You know where you are?\nANTRANAK: No answer. A whimper at best.\nANTRANAK: This is the House of Death. No one leaves here alive. You are going to die here today, but I am Antranak and I am Chief of the Palace Guard. As such, the manner of your death is in my power. If you answer my questions you will die quickly and feel no more pain. You\nANTRANAK: 20\nANTRANAK: could even take pleasure with one of the temple girls before you die. You’d like that? But if you don’t answer, I will have your eyes gouged from your head. Your nose and ears will be shorn from your face and then you will be castrated. I will leave your tongue in your head so that you can beg for death and tell me who sent you. Now who is your master?\nANTRANAK: The prisoner spits. From ANTRANAK’s reaction, we'd say the prisoner spat in his face.\nANTRANAK: You are a fool. But you will tell me in time. Priests, set burning coals under this vermin. Perhaps fire will burn the truth from his carcass.\nANTRANAK: As the door eloses, there are crackles and then another wild scream from the prisoner.\nANTRANAK: 16. Erimem’s Chambers. PERI and ERIMEM are present as FAYUM is tending the DOCTOR.\nERIMEM: What is the Doctor’s condition, Fayum?\nFAYUM: His pulse and breathing are weak, Pharaoh, like the old in their last days\nPERI: But he’s going to be all right?\nPERI: FaYuUM By all that I know he should be dead already. I have seen a few cases of poisoning such as this and none have survived as long as your friend.\nERIMEM: So he will survive?\nERIMEM: FPAYoM I fear not, Highness. There is no cure for the venom and\nERIMEM: it is always fatal. He is unconscious, so at least he will feel no pain.\nPERI: There must be something you can do. What about antitoxins? Or even penicillin?\nFAYUM: I don’t understand, my lady.\nFAYUM: PERI Of course you don't. They haven’t been discovered yet. Maybe if I could find the right mosses I could make some, but I don’t know if they even grow here.\nERIMEM: Tend the Doctor, Fayum. Help him all you can.\nFAYUM: I must attend an emergency council meeting soon but I have called for a more experienced healer to attend him while I am Sone. But there is something else that seems odd. I would swear that I could make out the beating of two hearts in his chest.”!\nERIMEM: Two hearts?\nPERI: Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? Come on, Doctor, you can come through this. You have to. You can’t just leave me here.\nERIMEM: He can’t hear you, Peri.\nPERI: I know. I just can’t believe a little scratch like that can kill him.\nERIMEM: Our people are skilled in the uses of poison.\nPERI: ‘You must be so proud.\nERIMEM: No, but it is a fact nonetheless. Denying it will not change that.\nPERI: So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for the Doctor to die?\nERIMEM: You could tell me why he seems to have two hearts.\nPERI: It’s probably a long story.\nPERI: A knock at the door and ANTRANAK's feet entering.\nPERI: 21\nANTRANAK: Majesty.\nERIMEM: Antranak, what have you learned?\nANTRANAK: Not as much as I would have liked, Majesty. The enemy charioteer we found in the desert still refuses to speak. For now, we know only that the assassin appears to have entered the palace an hour or so before the banquet began.\nPERI: How did he get in? Don’t you have any security here?\nANTRANAK: One of the hesets saw him coming from the Palace of Concubines. She thought he was one of the eunuchs.\nANTRANAK: EI If he had lived, I would have made sure that he became one and then executed him.\nPERI: Have you asked at the... what’s it called?\nERIMEM: Palace of Concubines.\nPERI: That's it.\nANTRANAK: That is not permitted. Other than eunuchs and the women themselves, only Pharaoh may enter.\nPERI: So you're not going to question them?\nERIMEM: That would be an unacceptable breach of our laws.\nPERI: Tll go. I'll find out what he was doing in there.\nANTRANAK: That is not possible.\nPERI: What if your Pharaoh says it is allowed?\nANTRANAK: My Pharaoch’s word is law.\nPERI: Erimem... your Majesty... let me go into the Palace. Please.\nERIMEM: Antranak, will you prepare an escort for us?\nPERI: Us? You’re coming with me?\nERIMEM: When I am crowned Pharaoh, I will be able to change laws as I see fit. For now, this is the only way you can enter the house of concubines.\nPERI: Okay. Let’s get going.\nANTRANAK: (Not at all happy) Pharaoh, I must protest...\nERIMEM: You have always been a good friend, Antranak. To my\nERIMEM: father and now to me. Please. Prepare the escort.\nANTRANAK: Thank you, Pharaoh. I will arrange a guard of my most trusted men. They will be ready within the hour.\nANTRANAK: 17. The Palace. The door closes behind ANTRANAK.\nANTRANAK: Soldier. Tell my personal guard to prepare themselves. They will be protecting Pharaoh herself tonight. I will join them presently. With a shuffle of feet, the soldier goes. ANTRANAK's footsteps hurry off in another direction. FAYUM runs towards him, a little breathless. A fiy buzzes annoyingly throughout.\nFAYUM: Antranak. Antranak...\nANTRANAK: Fayum? Your council meeting finished sooner than I expected. What did they decide?\nFAYUM: I'm surprised you don’t know already. I’m sure your spies had their ears pressed to the door as usual. You should take care, Antranak. If your men were caught listening to the council, you could be executed. You have a great many enemies in there.\nANTRANAK: I am too long in the tooth to care for such piddling laws. Besides, my spies will have heard nothing. The doors are solid wood and\nANTRANAK: 22\nANTRANAK: thicker than one of the great stones of the pyramids. Tell me what was decided - or I shall hear it from the priest of Maab in the nearest tavern.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM The council decided that Erimem... ANTRANAK The Mighty Erimem.\nFAYUM: ---@8 you will, cannot be crowned Pharaoh until certain\nFAYUM: questions have been answered.\nANTRANAK: [Even the flies feel the unrest. Go on.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM The question of whether there can even be a female Pharaoh is a contentious one, which has the council split in half.\nANTRANAK: Who is against?\nFAYUM: Horemshep is obviously the loudest opponent of the coronation. And where the Priest of Horus goes...\nANTRANAK: .. the House of Isis follows. Who else?\nFAYUM: All those wou would expect to sit in Horemshep’s shadow, hoping for his approval.” The priests of Seth, Hathor... The rest of us believe that the coronation should proceed. The houses of Osiris and Ma’at spoke loudly in favour of Erimem — the Mighty Erimem.\nANTRANAK: As did you? I would bet my life that you did.** What of the assassin's claim?\nANTRANAK: FayYuM It will be investigated fully - there will be no coronation until it is. That was the compromise agreed.\nANTRANAK: You would delay the coronation on the dying words of a killer?\nFAYUM: 1 will show you why we have chosen to delay the coronation. Come with me.\nFAYUM: Sound of their feet moving along the corridor.\nANTRANAK: Where are we going? I have a great deal to do.\nANTRANAK: Footsteps climbing stone stairs.\nFAYUM: Just to the balcony. There. What do you see?\nANTRANAK: Is this 4 game? I see Thebes. What else would I see?\nFAYUM: No. Look closer. We are late into the night and yet the\nFAYUM: lights still burn. The taverns and inns are still filled with people And what do you think they are talking of? ‘The True Pharaoh’. Our people rely upon this palace for leadership. They will have asked questions among themselves concerning Erimem’s claimn.*° Now, with this, they will be confused and in the city there will be unrest. Only when this question of another claim to the throne has been investigated and dismissed can Erimem ascend to the throne clear of suspicions and accusations of\nFAYUM: unworthiness.\nFAYUM: You may be right. FAYuM I think that is the first time you have ever openly agreed with me.\nANTRANAK: It’s late, I'm tired and I must be getting old. I'll try not to let it happen again.**\nANTRANAK: FAyYUM (Laughing) Please do. I would hate for both of our reputations to be tarnished.\nANTRANAK: I doubt anyone’s opinion of you could fall any lower. FAYUM And I doubt their opinion of you is particularly high after your troops let a murderer into the palace.\nANTRANAK: J know that. Damn flies.\nANTRANAK: Fly's buzzing continues.\nFAYUM: How are your investigations progressing?\nFAYUM: 33\nANTRANAK: Steadily. We are making progress.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM And the Mighty Erimem? Is she safe?\nANTRANAK: (A tad uncomfortably) I must join her soon. She is planning to visit the Palace of Concubines. As safe a place as any in the palace.\nFAYUM: I hope so. But now I wonder if anywhere is safe. Everything seems so uncertain now. Even here in the Palace of Pharaoh herself.\nFAYUM: ANTRANAK The palace is more secure than it has ever been.*” YANIS A lie and you know it.\nFAYUM: 18. Yanis’s tent.\nYANIS: can hear the last few lines of the conversation between FAYUM and ANTRANAK, though the voices are distorted. Tent flap opens and\nKISHIK: enters, the dialogue over ANTRANAK’s and FAYUM’s.\nKISHIK: Great Yanis...\nYANIS: Begone, Kishik. I will not be disturbed. By anyone.\nKISHIK: As you command.\nYANIS: Now, where were we? Speak up, idiots.\nFAYUM: CDistort) Would it not have been more, prudent for\nFAYUM: Erimem to visit the Palace of Concubines in the morning?**\nANTRANAK: (Distort) I do not question Pharaoch’s actions.\nANTRANAK: FAayUuM (Distort) Is she going, perhaps, to investigate the rumours that the assassin was seen coming from there?\nANTRANAK: (Distort) Pharaoh need not explain herself to anyone. Besides, how could I stop her? Her will is law.\nYANIS: (Laughing) And soon her body will feed the Jackals.\nANTRANAK: (Distort) 1 should be returning to Pharaoh now..\nANTRANAK: 19. Palace balcony.\nANTRANAK: Mix mid-sentence to the ongoing conversation, now without the distortion.\nANTRANAK: I should be returning to Pharaoh now... A fly still buzzes around.\nANTRANAK: Damn this fly.\nANTRANAK: His hand slaps.\nANTRANAK: Missed. Ha!\nANTRANAK: A metal clatter — this time he splats the fly.\nANTRANAK: FAYUM A sword to squash a fly, Antranak? Now I know we are safe.\nANTRANAK: (Snorting) It made me feel better, Fayum. Now, tend to the Doctor and we'll talk later.\nANTRANAK: 20. Yanis’s tent. Int. With the fly dead, YANIS can’t hear any more of ANTRANAK’s conversation.\nYANIS: Ah! You did well my little friend. You let me hear enough. Sound of a device being switched off — there's fumbling and cack-handed operation of the device. YANIS obviously isn’t used to anything like this.\nYANIS: Incredible device. What other marvels are hidden here I wonder? (Bellows) Kishik! Sound of tent flap opening.\nYANIS: 24\nKISHIK: Lord Yanis?\nYANIS: Prepare the troops. We surround Thebes immediately.\nKISHIK: As you command, my Lord. But... surely their armies will sight us before we get near the city.\nKISHIK: YANIS Of course they will. But an army mourning the tragic\nKISHIK: death of that virgin brat, Erimem, will have no stomach for fighting. It will be a glorious slaughter.\nKISHIK: Erimem is dead?\nYANIS: Not yet but soon. Very soon. Prepare the troops. Sound of EKISHIK leaving. The device is fiddled with again. YANIS still hasn’t got the hang of it.\nYANIS: I must alert more of our smallest soldiers to their great task.\nYANIS: 21. The Palace of Concubines. The sound of a platoon of guards arriving at the Palace with PERI and ERIMEM. ANTRANAK leads the guards.\nANTERANAK: Halt.\nANTERANAK: Footsteps stop.\nANTRBANAK: Majesty, we are here. I will rouse the Palace of Concubines.\nPERI: It's enormous. How many women are in here?\nPERI: My father had over sixty wives when he died.\nPERI: Thumping on solid wooden doors. A demand for entry rather than genteel knocking.\nPERI: ERIME] Brides of my divine fathers. We ask permission to enter. No answer.\nPERI: Nobody home?\nANTRANAK: 1 believe I know the reason for the delay, Majesty. One of the palace women was found dead a few hours ago.\nERIMEM: ‘Was it Rhaoubak? Antranak?\nANTRANAK: No, Majesty. Your mother is well, but like the other women, she is in mourning for Varela.\nANTRANAK: Varela?\nPERI: You knew her?\nPERI: ERIME] She tended me when I was a child.\nPERI: Why did she kill herself. Antranak?\nANTEANAK: I don't know. They say she had been quiet these last few days. Today she took seorpion venom while sitting in the gardens. I\nPERI: \" T don’t want to seem harsh but we still need to know what the killer was doing in there. Antranak?\nANTEANAE: She is right. We do need answers. Highness.\nPERI: If we wait it might be too late to help the Doctor.\nERIMEM: You are right. We will mourn Varela later.\nPERI: Besides. one of the women could slip away.\nERIMEM: Impossible. There is only one exit from this palace.\nANTRAWAK: Actually. Great One. there is a second — it dates back hundreds of years. Very few know of its existence.\nANTRAWAK: 25\nPERI: Show us.\nANTRANAK: I would but I may not enter.\nANTRANAK: A heftier thump on the door this time.\nANTRANAK: Women, open your doors for Pharaoh Erimemushinteperem, daughter of light.\nANTRANAK: The doors open. A slave — obviously mute - answers the door with a snhivelling grunt.\nANTRANAK: You took your time.\nANTRANAK: A downtrodden grunt.\nPERI: He's here now. Don’t scare him to death.\nANTRANAK: You know the hidden exit from the palace?\nANTRANAK: A grunt that says yes.\nPERI: Show us where it is.\nERIMEM: Peri, wait.\nPERI: What?\nPERI: I must enter first. If you had gone ahead of me, your life would be forfeit.\nPERI: Okay. After you.\nANTRANAK: (Quietly to PERI — ERIMEM isn't meant to hear this) Hear me, air. My Pharaoh may be walking into danger to help you enter this place.*’ J hold you responsible for her safety. If any harm comes to her, yu will answer to me. Remember that.\nANTRANAK: If you had done your job properly, we wouldn't have to go is here.® # You remember that. Peri?\nPERI: Coming.\nANTRANAK: My troops will wait for you, Pharaoh. The doors close behind them.\nPERI: Which way? The slave grunts. Show us.\nPERI: Inside the palace, there are sounds of crying. It gets louder as their footsteps head forward.\nPERI: ERIMEM The women weep for Varela.\nPERI: It's probably best that we look at this other exit first and talk to them later.\nERIMEM: 1 think that is wise. Their tears make me uncomfortable, too.\nPERI: I thought it was just me. Do you want to see your mother while we're here?\nPERI: More than I can say, but I have seen her weep enough recently. How far to the entrance?\nPERI: A grunt.\nPEBI: Is everyone this talkative?\nPEBI: EEIMEM The slave’s tongue was cut from his head after he was\nPEBI: taken in battle. PERI And he’s a eunuch as well? Poor guy.\nPEBI: A grunt that says we're here.\nPERI: This is it? I don’t see anything.\nPERI: A stone door swings open with a loud rumbie.\nPERI: As it should be. The exit is hidden — put here in case invaders took the palace.\nPERI: 26\nPERI: (Voice echoing slightly) We'll need torches. These two will do, eine torches crackle as they’re taken from wall brackets.\nPERI: Perhaps we should go back and collect some of your pales guards. ERIMEM The only men who can enter here are eunuchs, remember? I cannot foresee many of my troops volunteering for that duty.\nPERI: Good point. I mean, good point, your Majesty.\nERIMEM: Please. Do not worry about any title. Life is much simpler and easier if people just call me Erimem.\nPERI: That won't get my head cut off or anything? I’m allergic to decapitation. It’s bad for the circulation.\nERIMEM: (Laughs) You are a strange one, Peri, but that is good. I hope I can call you a friend.\nPERI: Who am I to say no to a Pharaoh?\nERIMEM: Wait here, Slave.\nERIMEM: Slave grunts.\nERIMEM: If we do not return by dawn, sends guards after us and let Seth take our traditions.\nPERI: Lots of guards. Big ones. With plenty of weapons.\nPERI: Another grunt. The rumble of the stone moving again.\nPERI: 21a. Int. Thebes Palace.\nFAYUM: is mixing herbs etc. with pestle and mortar. Or some such.\nFAYUM: I wish I could identify the poison that has taken you, Doctor. Pharaoh has told me to find a cure but I'm not sure if I can. Of course, if I don’t, you'll die. Pharaoh will be unhappy. Antranak will be unhappy because Pharaoh is unhappy and so I will, naturally, become somewhat more unhappy. And then I...\nFAYUM: Something has shocked him\nFAYUM: Doctor! Doc —\nFAYUM: He is cut off as someone's hand goes over his mouth, he drops the bowls etc to the floor and is mumbling panic-struck...\nFAYUM: 82, The passage under the Palace of Concubines. PERI and ERIMEM hear their footsteps echo eerily.\nERIMEM: These passages must be almost five hundred years old.\nPERI: Kind of creepy, aren’t they? Claustrophobic.\nERIMEM: I do feel a certain... unease.\nPERI: These tapestries are amazing. The needlework is so\nPERI: intricate but from the way the colours have faded they must be decades old. More maybe. ERIMEM The women must have made them up above and decorated the passages with them.\nPERI: PERI To make them homey. just in case? I have to say, I don’t think it is working.\nERIMEM: There is the doorway.\nERIMEM: PERI The dust on the floor. Footprints. There's just one set of\nERIMEM: tracks — heading up the way we came, so it wasn't someone coming down\nERIMEM: =\nERIMEM: here from the Palace. I'd bet my last buck those are the assassin’s prints from when he came in.” (Beat) Can we talk about something else for a\nERIMEM: while?\nERIMEM: Tell me about you and the Doctor, Peri. Have you been married long?\nPERI: What? We're not married!\nERIMEM: Are you his concubine, then? Or a slave?\nPERI: I’m no slave — and I’m certainly nobody's concubine. The Doctor and I are friends, that's all.\nERIMEM: Really? That is extraordinary.\nPERI: Men and women can’t be friends here?\nERIMEM: No. A woman's place is to serve her man\nPERI: That’s so... prehistoric!\nERIMEM: I don’t understand.\nPERI: I’m sorry. I keep forgetting where — when — I am. It’s just that things are different where I come from.\nERIMEM: Really? Tell me. Who rules you?\nPERI: Well, every four years the public decides who's going to run the country.\nPERI: ERIMEM The ordinary people? All of them?\nPERI: Everybody. As long as they’re adult, not in jail or mad. Well, then again...\nERIMEM: Amazing. Tell...\nPERI: (Cutting in - the conversation’s getting awkward) Do you mind if I ask how you came to be Pharaoh? I thought they were all men.\nERIMEM: Usually they are, and I think most of my council of priests believe that only men should be Pharaoh.\nPERI: Rubbish. A woman can rule just as well as a man. Look\nPERI: at Margaret Thatcher. Well okay, maybe that’s a bad analogy.** Indira Ghandi.\nERIMEM: I do not understand, but I thank you anyway. (She sighs) A year ago I wouldn't have believed this possible.\nPERI: Why?\nERIMEM: Back then I was little Princess Erimem. I was sixteen\nERIMEM: years old but to everyone I was still the little girl whose nose they had wiped. My father was Pharaoh and my three older half-brothers were more important than me, so I was left to my own devices.\nPERI: What happened?\nBRIMEM: First, my eldest brother was killed when the axle of his chariot snapped. It rolled over and landed on him.\nPERI: I'm sorry.\nERIMEM: So am I. I think we were to have married one day.\nPERI: Your brother?\nERIMEM: It is tradition. The royal line must be kept pure. But first\nERIMEM: he died, and then a fever took my youngest brother less than a month later. The last of my brothers was bitten by an asp inside his own rooms at the palace. He fought the poison for five days before it took him. I think a little of my father died with each of his sons. I wasn't surprised when he died six months after my eldest brother. Only that he allowed himself to be ambushed by mercenaries while out in his chariot. But he had been taking chances like he had never done before, as if he did not care any more.\nPERI: Pm sorry. Really.\nPERI: 28\nERIMEM: Thank you. Now my only living relation is my mother but now she thinks I am a god and will not look me in the face.” She can barely talk to me.\nPERI: What do you think?\nERIMEM: I think that a god would not have needed the Doctor to\nERIMEM: save her life twice in less than a day, and a god would not feel as afraid as I feel now.\nPERI: If it’s any consolation, you're not alone there. Hey, it's broadening out.®°\nPERI: ERIMEM At last.\nPERI: What is it?\nPERI: ERIMEM A chapel for the women to worship their gods.\nPERI: More tapestries. And if my step-father saw that altar he'd\nPERI: think he was in heaven. He could get years of work out of the inscriptions alone.\nERIMEM: It reaches back to the first dynasty.\nPERI: Can you hear that?\nERIMEM: What?\nPERI: Listen.\nPERI: Nothing at first, and then there is a sort of scraping sound. Very unnerving and creepy. Worse than fingers down the biackboard.\nPERI: That’s the wind, right? Except that there’s no wind down here.\nERIMEM: There. At the door.\nPERI: Oh my God. Scorpions.\nPERI: The sound of the scorpions scratching and rubbing against each other is loud and freaky. It really is weird and unsettling to listen to. ead Hundreds of them.\nPERI: Thousands. They’re everywhere. They're swarming.\nEEIMEM: They’ve blocked the doorway. We are trapped.\nPERI: Quick. Up on the altar.\nERIMEM: That would be sacrilege.\nPERI: Better than the last rites. Come on. Climb up.\nPERI: Sounds of them climbing up as well as the continuous sound of the scorpions.\nPERI: I’ve never seen anything like that. I thought scorpions were solitary animals.\nERIMEM: They are. They even hate their own kind. Put two together and they will fight until one is dead.\nPERI: They're not fighting now. Can they climb?\nERIMEM: I have never seen them do so.\nPERI: That’s something. Oh, no.\nERIMEM: What?\nPERI: They're climbing on top of each other like they’re making a ramp.\nPERI: I don’t believe it. It will only take a few minutes for them to reach us.\nPERI: This isn’t right. They shouldn't be acting like this. They shouldn’t be smart enough to do this.\nERIMEM: They're almost here.\nPERI: (Desperately thinking) How thick are those tapestries?\nERIMEM: They're made of the hardest wearing wools.\nERIMEM: 29\nPERI: This is probably sacrilege as well. Grab the other end and\nPERI: pull.\nERIMEM: It is stuck.\nPERI: Pull harder. Pull.\nPERI: Sound of tapestry tearing and being pulled off the wall.\nERIMEM: It’s free.\nPERI: Throw it over the scorpions.\nPERI: Sound of the tapestry flopping onto the scorpions.\nERIMEM: You want us to run over the top of them?\nPERI: Do you have a better idea? Come on.\nPERI: On top of the chittering and scraping of the scorpions we hear a set of sickly, erunching footsteps.\nPERI: Ugh! This is horrible.\nPERI: ERIMEM The tapestry doesn't reach the door.\nPERI: It’s only a few feet. We'll have to jump.\nPERI: The sound of them jumping.\nPERI: Made it.\nERIMEM: They are following us.\nERIMEM: PERI And they're blocking the way back. We'll have to follow the passage to the other way out.\nERIMEM: We don’t know what will be waiting for us there.\nPERI: It can’t be any worse than what's behind us.\nERIMEM: I believe you have a point.\nPERI: This way. I think.\nPERI: 23. Yanis’s camp.\nYANIS: bellows an outraged, angry yell.\nYANIS: YANIS. Damn those witches, they have escaped.\nKISHIK: My lord?\nKISHIK: Sound of KISHIK being grabbed by the gullet and choked.\nYANIS: Did I give you leave to speak, vermin?\nYANIS: More chokings and gurglings before KISHIK is tossed aside to land loudly and painfully.\nYANIS: These Egyptian milksops are weak with their women. Letting them run free, doing the work of men. I'll show those women how they should be treated, before I gut them and throw them to the crocodiles. (Even louder) Why are we not surrounding Thebes now?\nYANIS: 24. The tunnels.\nERIMEM: Is that light ahead?\nPERI: T hope so. The torches are almost dead. Still, they’ve done their job. We’ve outrun the scorpions\nPERI: Sound of torches being chucked away.\nPERI: It’s morning.\nERIMEM: I have never seen a more beautiful sunrise.\nPERI: Me either. Where are we?\nERIMEM: Give me a moment. Ah. There is the palace. We must be\nERIMEM: at the base of the Western hills.\nPERI: (Shivering) I wish we’d worn something warmer than these dresses. It's freezing out in the open.\nPERI: 30\nPERI: ERIMEM The walk will soon warm us. There — I think I see the market opening in the city.\nPERI: 25. House Of Death. Int.\nPERI: More moans and screams. The prisoner AVTRANAK ordered tortured is whimpering. He gasps for air and is obviously in a lot of pain. A priest is chanting quietly as he goes about his torturing.\nPRIEST: Im hishem ur tepmeram uvmet...\nHOREMSHEP: startles the PRIEST.\nHOREMSHEP: Is this the slave who tried to murder our Pharaoh? Has he spoken?\nPRIEST: No, Lord Horemshep. He is..,\nPRIEST: Sounds of a knife being unsheathed very quickly. There's a cutting sound and the PRIEST gurgies as his throat is cut. The prisoner whimpers optimistically.”\nHOREMSHEP: Ssssh. Quietly. Don’t be encouraged by my presence, you poor, poor fool. You are in no condition to escape, but I’m afraid you can’t be interrogated either.\nHOREMSHEP: The prisoner gasps — sound of the knife being stuck into him.\nHOREMSHEP: After all, no one leaves the House of Death alive.\nHOREMSHEP: 26. Thebes, PERI and ERIMEM are heading back towards the Palace. The locals are vocal in their adoration.\nPERI: My mom could have a field day here.\nERIMEM: How much are the dates?\nSTALLHOLDER: Nothing. Nothing, Great One.\nERIMEM: I would not deprive you of your livelihood. One of my hand-maidens will bring your payment later. Peri...?\nPERI: Thanks. I've never tried these for breakfast before. Can I ask a question?\nERIMEM: Please.\nPERI: How do you deal with all this? The bowing and stuff.\nERIMEM: Not very well, apparently. My father was always scolding\nERIMEM: me for not being regal enough. J shudder to think what he would say if he could see me now, walking among the people, like a commoner. But Ido wish he was here. Then I would not have this... burden of duty on me.\nPERI: For what it’s worth, you may just have invented one of the most important political tools ever — the walkabout.°? Oh, there's Antranak. Ah, looks like we’ve been spotted.\nPERI: Sound of feet running towards them.\nPERI: ERIMEM A pity. I could learn to like walking through the market like a normal person.\nANTRANAK: Great Pharaoh! You are safe.\nERIMEM: Obviously.\nPERI: We're both safe. Thanks for asking.\nANTRANAK: When you did not return, I sent dozens of men into the catacombs. They found only...\nPERI: Scorpions? We know. Can I see the Doctor?\nERIMEM: Antranak, escort us to my chambers.\nERIMEM: 31\nANTRANAK: As you command.\nPERI: How is he?\nANTRANAK: Fayum is with him. When last I heard the Doctor's condition had not changed.*° Still unconscious.\nPERI: But not dead. (Wo answer) He's not dead?\nANTRANAK: Not as far as I know, although...\nPERI: Although what?\nERIMEM: Tell us, old friend.\nANTRANAK: I fear there are those in this city who would see him dead.\nPERI: Why? We only just got here.\nPERI: ANTRANAK The Royal Court is a vipers’ nest. That Pharaoh has shown the Doctor and you favour makes some of the court worry as to how secure their positions are. I know a number who would think nothing of removing him — whatever it took.\nPERI: You included?\nANTRANAK: I am loyal to my Pharaoh. ERIMEM And I am grateful. We are here. Doors are pushed open.\nPERI: I hope he’s okay. Where is he?\nANTRANAK: Fayum? Fayum?\nERIMEM: He’s not here.\nPERI: Where is he? Doctor?**\nANTRANAK: I left him here.\nPERI: He’s not here now. Doctor? Doctor?\nERIMEM: Antranak! How can the Doctor have disappeared?\nERIMEM: END OF PART Two**"

I’ll go on foot from here.\nDOCTOR: FaYuM I must go with you.\nDOCTOR: I'd rather go alone. It’s bound to be dangerous.\nDOCTOR: FayuM Pharaoh charged me with your well-being. I cannot leave you alone.\nDOCTOR: I assume I'd be wasting my time trying to change your\nDOCTOR: mind? Very well.\nDOCTOR: 28, Erimem’s Chambers.\nERIMEM: is trying to console PERI.\nERIMEM: Don’t worry, Peri. We will find him.\nPERI: But will he still be alive?\nERIMEM: Be is strong. 1 am sure...\nANTRANAK: interrupts. He is agitated.\nANTRANAK: Great Pharach.\nERIMEM: What is it, Antranak?\nPERI: You've found the Doctor?\nANTRANAK: Alas not. But our scouts have spied the army of Mercenaries. They have surrounded Thebes to the south and the west.\nANTRANAK: 33\nANTRANAK: They have sent a message demanding that we surrender immediately — or they will kill every man, woman and child in Egypt.\nERIMEM: Our troops?\nANTRANAK: Foot-soldiers and chariots of the army stand ready. As do my Palace Guard... BRIMEM And the temple’s troops? Antranak? Tell me. ANTAANAK The council of priests is split over committing its troops.\nPERI: That’s crazy.\nANTRANAK: Perhaps, but once Erimem, forgive me, Pharaoh has led our troops in battle, the deliberations of the council concerning her right to the throne will be worthless. The people will never allow a victorious Pharaoh to be deposed.\nPERI: So they’d rather see their city destroyed by mercenaries than see Erimem crowned Pharaoh?\nERIMEM: I do not think so, Peri. They are wily and cunning. They\nERIMEM: have waited like jackals for the moment to strike at me. Now we shall see what they plan. ANTRANAK The council has asked that you attend the emergency council meeting which sits as we speak.\nERIMEM: They summon me like I were a common serving girl.\nPERI: I didn’t think anyone could order a Pharaoh to do anything. They must be feeling confident.\nANTRANAK: It is an outrage. Give me the word and my men will cut that cabal of weasels into feed for the palace dogs.\nERIMEM: No. Tell the priests that I will attend.\nANTRANAK: But...\nERIMEM: Do it, Antranak, or I will have someone else deliver the message.\nERIMEM: No, Highness. I will do it. But they will regret this insult. I swear it. 29. The desert.\nERIMEM: The DOCTOR and FAYUM are still out in the desert, talking quietly. As\nERIMEM: they speak, we hear their movements through the dunes and over the sands.\nERIMEM: DOCTOR The Nile’s east and they have Thebes surrounded to the south and the west. Why not the north, I wonder? Unless you have a garrison to the north.\nERIMEM: FAYUM. A large one — at Giza.\nDOCTOR: I thought so. Whoever’s in charge of this lot isn’t stupid. If he’d sent men to the north they might have been sandwiched between the troops in Thebes and the garrison at Giza.\nFAYUM: We're lucky his men aren’t so alert. I can hardly believe we slipped through their lines so easily.\nDOCTOR: Men who fight for money tend to be less attentive to duty\nDOCTOR: than those who fight for honour or their beliefs. Now I’d guess that the camp is just over these dunes.\nDOCTOR: Sounds of them clambering up a dune.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there it is. Keep your head down.\nFAYUM: There must be thousands of mercenaries for the camp to be this size.\nFAYUM: 34\nDOCTOR: Well, look on the bright side — most of them are already in position to attack the city so they won't be here to worry about us. FAYuUM That’s the bright side? wney Beep moving, scrunching through the sand.\nDOCTOR: If they're in position I can’t help wondering why they Parents \"dianien Gen Ah. That big tent at the centre must be their leader’s. Come on. I want a look inside.\nFAYUM: Wouldn’t it be wiser to fetch help?\nDOCTOE: Undoubtedly, but I've got this terrible feeling in my mind... never mind. We'll skirt the dunes as best we can. Stay low. They move on. DOCTOR A guard. Down. A moment.\nDOCTOR: All right. Come on.\nFAYUM: You move like a spirit, Doctor. I did not think we would live this long.\nFAYUM: 4 I'm a little surprised myself. I thought the camp would be better guarded...\nGUARD: You! Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Why can't I keep my mouth shut?\nDOCTOR: The sound of an arrow being fired and hitting the GUARD. He gurgles,\nDOCTOR: dying.\nDOCTOR: Fayum! Was that absolutely necessary?\nDOCTOR: FayumM He would have raised the alarm.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOE From now on, use that bow only as a last resort. I came here to avoid bloodshed, not start it.\nPAYUM: I do not understand you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: dust get that guard out of sight before he’s spotted. He'll be missed before long. We'll have to look sharp. Quickly now. This is the one. It’s empty. Inside.\nDOCTOR: Tent flaps shut behind them.\nFAYUM: Look at these jewels, Doctor. From all corners of the world.*® And so much gold.\nDOCTOR: Evidently crime does pay. The spoils of previous campaigns, no doubt.\nFAYUM: Doctor, the blood on this armour...\nDOCTOR: Still fresh. This is interesting. Battlefield tents don’t usually have a second room. I wonder what’s through here. Very interesting indeed.\nDOCTOR: Flap opens.\nDOCTOR: Fayom What... oh. that stench. It’s like rotting meat.\nDOCTOR: I'm rather afraid it is. Human meat. Corpses behind this metal block. It must be a shrine of some kind.\nFAYUOM: Human sacrifice? Some of these are wearing the uniforms\nFAYUOM: of our chariot squadrons. This is no way for men to die. Look at them, left for the insects to feast on. Their souls will never find rest.\nDOCTOR: This metal block must be an altar. The markings are pather unusual, though. So is the metal, come to think of it. Definitely an alloy not developed yet. Let's have a proper look... ob, no.\nDOCTOR: The chittering sound of bugs and insects is becoming louder. Metallic scrape as the Doctor grabs a bit of metal\nDOCTOR: T've seen all I need to, Fayum. Time we were going.\nDOCTOR: 35\nFAYUM: What did you take from the altar?\nDOCTOR: This is no time for a discussion. Go.\nDOCTOR: Sound of a tent flap opening and of the DOCTOR and FAYUM stopping sharpish.\nYANIS: Leaving already? You've barely sampled my hospitality.\nDOCTOR: If what’s through there is any indication of how you treat guests, I'll pass if it’s all the same with you.\nYANIS: You must be the fair-haired giant who saved Erimem.\nFAYUM: Show respect when you speak of Pharaoh.\nYANIS: Did I give you leave to speak?\nYANIS: Sound of a whip and FAYUM yelping.\nYANIS: Did I give you leave to bleed?\nYANIS: Another crack of the whip. Sound of FAYUM falling over, exclaiming in pain.\nYANIS: Or to fall over?\nYANIS: DOCTOR And who gave you leave to slaughter those men through there?\nYANIS: Interesting. You are in my tent, in the middle of my camp,\nYANIS: surrounded by thousands of my men, yet you do not fear me. You should. You really should.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. You should fear what you found in that stasis box through there.*°\nYANIS: Stasis box?\nDOCTOR: Yes, you're using it as an altar.\nYANIS: What do you know of such things, dog?\nDOCTOR: Doctor, actually. And I know it’s best not to interfere with\nDOCTOR: a stasis box when you find one - especially ones with prison markings on them.\nYANIS: You know a great deal more than you should.\nDOCTOR: So I’ve been told.\nDOCTOR: YANISs You are a dangerous enemy, Doctor. Too dangerous to remain alive. I shall take great pleasure in killing you myself.*\nDOCTOR: Really? Danger’s all in the mind, surely? But then,\nDOCTOR: I imagine you've got rather a lot on your mind these days. Your thoughts, other people's thoughts.\nYANIS: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: I had a rather long nap last night.*® My mind went wandering and it sensed a presence nearby - a strong telepathic presence. The entity you discovered in the stasis box. Do you know exactly what it is?\nYANIS: Power. Power over men. Over their minds. The power to\nYANIS: rule the world.\nDOCTOR: ‘Yes, but who'll be ruling you, I wonder?\nYANIS: No one rules Yanis! I am warlord and I will have this\nYANIS: world at my feet.\nDOCTOR: Rather lofty ambitions for a third rate bully.\nYANIS: I will cut your heart out and you will live just long enough\nYANIS: to see me feast on it.\nDOCTOR: Not today thank you. We'll be going if it’s all the same to\nDOCTOR: you.\nYANIS: You have courage, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Talso have a little something I picked up from your stasis ox there.\nDOCTOR: 36\nYANIS: What is that?\nYANIS: Sounds of the DOCTOR fixing the bit of the stasis box he picked up earlier.\nDOCTOR: You don’t know, do you? I imagine the presence in your mind recognises it. The telepathic inhibitor core circuits. A little bashed up but nothing that can’t be mended by someone who knows what they’re doing.\nYANIS: Stop. Put it down.\nYANIS: DOCTOR The little voice in your head getting nervous? Don’t worry. It's perfectly harmless in the long run but if I do this...\nYANIS: High pitched sound effect followed by screams and yells from YANIS and his troops.\nDOCTOR: It does rather tend to disorient telepaths for a while. FaYuUM Let me kill him.\nDOCTOR: There’s no time for that. Come on. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Tent flap opening. More wails and yells.\nDOCTOR: It’s got better range than I anticipated but the effect won’t\nDOCTOR: last forever. Quickly. We’ll take one of their chariots. Sounds of them leaping onto a chariot and the reins being flicked.\nFAYUM: Hold on. Ha! Ha!\nFAYUM: 30. Yanis’s tent. The mercenaries are slowly recovering.\nYANIS: Up. On your feet. Up, before I grind your legs into the dirt. He lurches through the tent flap. The chariot is thundering off.\nYANIS: After them. Do whatever you have to, but bring me the\nYANIS: fair one alive. No one kills him but me. I will do it with my bare hands.\nYANIS: 31, The chariot. From the sound of it, the chariot is travelling at full pelt.\nFAYUM: We're through their lines.\nDOCTOR: We're not free yet. I make out three, no, four chariots following us.*®\nFAYUM: We have a good head start but they are more experienced with these chariots than I am.\nDOCTOR: We're still well out of range of their archers. Head for the\nDOCTOR: oasis. Our own chariot is faster than this one and the horses will be fresher, They won’t catch us.\nFAYUM: Ha! Faster! Faster!\nDOCTOR: Home, James, and never mind the horses. (No response) Never mind.\nDOCTOR: 32. Erimem’s chambers. PERI and ERIMEM are in the chamber. ANTRANAK enters.\nANTRANAK: My queen, it is almost time.\nERIMEM: I know, Antranak. We had better not Keep the priests waiting. Peri, will you come with me?\nPERI: I thought I might go and look for the Doctor again. But I guess you could do with a friend where you’re going.\nERIMEM: Thank you. Lead the way, Antranak.\nERIMEM: 37\nERIMEM: 35. The desert.\nYANIS: is receiving reports.\nYANIS: Well, Kishik? Are the men in position?\nKISHIK: Exactly as you commanded, Lord Yanis.\nYANIS: Order them to hold position.\nKISHIK: Hold? I thought we were to attack.\nYANIS: Are you as deaf as you are ugly and stupid? Hold! There\nYANIS: are many ways to win a battle. Our ally in the city will try his way first. KISHIK And if he fails?\nYANIS: (Brightening and cheering up no end) Then the Nile will run scarlet as Thebes drowns in torrents of its own blood. What a Magnificent thought.\nYANIS: 34. The Council Chamber. The chamber is quiet bar a low murmur of conversation. Sound of the great doors opening.\nANTRANAK: Daughter of the most high divine Pharaoh, link to the living Gods, Pharaoh in waiting, Erimemushinteperem, light of the...\nERIMEM: Everyone here knows who I am, Antranak, and we have little enough time as it is.\nERIMEM: sits.\nERIMEM: (Quietly) I am glad you came, Peri. I think I have few friends in this room.\nPERI: They look like a pack of vultures.\nERIMEM: Who summoned Pharaoh as if she were a slave?\nHOREMSHEP: I did, Highness.\nANTRANAK: Horemshep. I hoped you would know better.\nERIMEM: Let him speak. I trust that you have a good reason for\nERIMEM: your actions, Horemshep.\nHOREMSHEP: I believe that I do. Pharaoh is Bgypt and Egypt is\nHOREMSHEP: Pharaoh. Our land needs the rule of Pharaoh, the living God. Pharaoh\nHOREMSHEP: Tules all of our lives.\nPERI: That’s why you called her like a dog?\nHOREMSHEP: (Ignoring PERI totally) Since the passing of her divine\nHOREMSHEP: father, we have all believed that the Princess Erimem was the only heir\nHOREMSHEP: to the throne of Pharaoh. But there is a doubt as to the right of a\nHOREMSHEP: daughter to claim the position of Pharaoh, which has caused a delay in\nHOREMSHEP: Erimem’s coronation. Many days we have debated long into the night.\nANTRANAK: Drunk long into the night, more like.\nANTRANAK: PERI And there have been female pharaohs before.\nHOREMSHEP: (Annoyed with Peri but still blanking her) But that\nHOREMSHEP: ene when the assassin stated that there was another claim to the\nHOREMSHEP: ne.\nERIMEM: Does the council often listen to the claims of murderers,\nERIMEM: Horemshep?\nHOREMSHEP: No, but this claim was too important to be ignored. So we\nHOREMSHEP: ordered an investigation.\nHOREMSHEP: phan And you found something already? That's quick work, jak.\nHOREMSHEP: Who is this... concubine?\nHOREMSHEP: 38\nERIMEM: Peri is my friend. She speaks with me. Answer us, Horemshep. What is is your evidence?\nERIMEM: HOREMSHEP The proof was given to us by those who sought to hide it from Egypt. News of our investigation caused them to make a fatal mistake —- by murdering an innocent woman in the Palace of Concubines.\nPERI: Varela was murdered? We assumed she'd committed suicide.\nHOREMSHEP: We have proof - and motive as well. The poison she took was very rare. Few in the city possess the skills required in its production and use. Tell us, Antranak, who in the palace understands the venoms of the serpents? ANTRANAK The priests of the snake gods, apothecaries, and a few others.\nHOREMSHEP: Including certain of your guards.\nANTRANAK: We have experts in the venoms but... wait... are you saying that one of my men killed Varela? If you are your proof had better be undeniable, or priest or not, you will answer to me.\nHOREMSHEP: I do not accuse one of your men, Antranak. I accuse you of the murder of Varela.\nHOREMSHEP: Uproar and bedlam. HOREMSHEP speaks louder to be heard. HOREMSHEP Of the murder of Varela and of conspiring to keep the true Pharaoh of the two lands of Egypt from the throne.\nERIMEM: Antranak?\nANTRANAK: Lies. All lies from that weasel. I'll kill him with my bare hands.\nHOREMSHEP: Hold him.\nANTRANAK: Release me. Let me go.\nPERI: I don’t believe it. Erimem... (no answer) Erimem? Pharaoh!\nERIMEM: (Shocked, shaken) I know Antranak is protective of me.\nERIMEM: He has been ever since I was a child. And I heard him threaten you at the Palace of Concubines, although I pretended not to. But he would not do this, surely? No. I don’t believe it either. And yet... I know he would do anything to protect me.\nERIMEM: Sound of the doors being thrown open and 2 commotion from outside.\nFAYUM: Let him pass. He carries the cartouche of Pharaoh.\nDOCTOR: Sorry to barge in like this. Have we missed anything?\nPERI: Doctor, you’re all right.\nDOCTOR: 1 will be if you let go. You're crushing my ribs.\nPERI: I thought you were dead.\nHOREMSHEP: As did we all.\nDOCTOR: No thanks. I've tried death a few times. Can’t say I care for it much.\nPERI: But the poison...\nDOCTOR: My body just put me into a deep sleep while it worked the\nDOCTOR: poison from my system. Best night’s sleep I’ve had in centuries.\nHOREMSHEP: Alive or dead, you have no place here, stranger.\nHOREMSHEP: ERIMEM The Doctor is also here as my counsel. Join us Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I'm honoured, Pharaoh. So, what's this all about?\nPERI: Horemshep’s accused Antranak of poisoning a.concubine\nPERI: to make sure she didn’t tell anyone that Erimem isn’t really heir to the throne.\nPERI: 39\nDOCTOR: Really? Has he said who is?\nPERI: Not yet. b\nDOCTOR: Interesting timing for this to happen. Majesty, may I ask a few questions?\nDOCTOR: ERIMEM Of course.\nDOCTOR: Horemshep, what proof do you have against Antranak?\nHOREMSHEP: As I have already stated, there are only a handful of people within the palace with the expertise to handle such a rare venom as killed Varela. The rooms and houses of everyone with that expertise were investigated by my palace guard.\nHOREMSHEP: DOCTOR And the poison was found in Antranak’s chambers? HOREMSHEP A vial with just enough missing to have killed Varela.\nDOCTOR: How did he give the poison to Varela? As I recall, men\nDOCTOR: aren't allowed in the Palace of Concubines.\nHOREMSHEP: Antranak knows all the secret entrances and passages in Thebes. Even yesterday he told Erimem of the existence of a secret passage. And he was seen moving away from the Palace of Concubines only an hour before the Lady Varela was found dead in the gardens.\nANTRANAK: It’s my duty to oversee security there, idiot.\nHOREMSHEP: Is it your duty to murder innocent women?\nDOCTOR: So let me get this right. Antranak slipped into the Palace of Concubines, poisoned the Lady Varela, then went back to his own chambers and hid the incriminating evidence there, ready for your guards to find? Careless of him. Almost unbelievably so. HOREMSHE?P Do you call me a liar, outsider?\nDOCTOR: No, no, no. Absolutely not. Well, not yet. Why would an intelligent man like Antranak leave the poison in his own rooms? Why not simply throw it in the Nile? Or put it in someone else’s chambers? To incriminate an innocent, for instance.\nHORBMSHEP: Ask him yourself.\nDOCTOR: I’@ rather ask you. And I'd be interested in knowing who ordered the search of Antranak’s quarters. It wouldn't have been you by any chance would it?\nHOREMSHEP: It was a council decision.\nDOCTOR: But whose idea? Yours? Yes? Interesting. The other question is why? Why would Antranak kill an innocent woman? If he had a motive, let's hear it.\nHOREMSHEP: Who are you to speak to Horemshep, Priest of Horus, leader of the council of...\nDOCTOR: I’m someone seeking the truth. Who are you? Motive — if you don’t mind. HOREMSHEP The reason for this cruel murder was discovered in the personal belongings of the Lady Varela. As we know, she was a wife of our beloved Pharaoh, who travelled to the west only a season ago. Among her possessions were letters written to her by her great husband.\nDOCTOR: That's hardly surprising. What was in the letters that was important enough to cost Varela her life? HOREMSHEP The letters told of Varela’s love for her husband, of her devotion e once of the son she bore him in secret.\nDOCTOR: Iproar — HEP has really played to the galleries. BRIMEM A brother? 8 ve\nDOCTOR: PERI And he would claim the throne just because he’s male.\nDOCTOR: 30\nERIMEM: By law, all male children are ahead of females in the line of succession.\nHOREMSHEP: Pharaoh fathered another son, older by three years then Erimem, and the true Pharaoh of Egypt. As a so-called friend of Pharaoh, Antranak knew of the child and sought to keep his existence secret so that Erimem could rule as Pharaoh — with his counsel.\nANTRANAK: Lies. All of it.\nHOREMSHEP: Antranak has betrayed his duty to Egypt and the trust of\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you happen to know where this Pharaoh is?\nHOREMSHEP: He is here, Doctor. In this room.\nDOCTOR: I thought he might be. You’d better tell us who he is\nDOCTOR: before the crowd gets restless.\nHOREMSHEP: Taken from Varela at birth, he was raised by one of the priests as his own. It is ironic that he and Erimem played together as children. He recently entered this council as a respected junior member, but now we will serve him. Fayum is the true Pharaoh.\nHOREMSHEP: Even more uproar.\nHOREMSHEP: YaYuUM What?\nHOREMSHEP: Step forward, mighty Fayum, and take the throne.\nFAYUM: You’re wrong.*! I’m not Pharaoh. I’m just a priest.\nHOBREMSHEP: You are the son of a living god. You are our most high FaYuM I'm nothing, I don't want to be Pharaoh. Get your hands\nHOREMSHEP: (Voice a bit guttural and odd) Embrace your destiny. This is what you were born for.\nFAYUM: My head. It feels... there's something... a voice. Voices.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) So that’s how it works.\nHOREMSHEP: You have a duty, Great Fayum. You know what you must do.\nFAYUM: now speaks differently - stronger and firmer.\nFAYUM: I know what must be done.\nHOREMSHEP: Step down, Erimem. Step down and kneel before the true Pharaoh, the mighty Fayum, ruler of the Two Lands of Egypt. Kneel. all of you.\nHOREMSHEP: General sounds of kneeling. scuffling. grovelling and abasing.\nHOREMSHEP: Move, girl, or be moved.\nDOCTOR: Stay where you are, Erimem. Is this the best proof you have. Horemshep? A bottle of poison and some old letters? Hardly conclusive, are they?\nHOREMSHEP: They are enough.\nHOREMSHEP: DOCTOR And jolly lucky for you that they were just lying about. HOBEMSHEP The Gods favour us by showing us the truth.\nHOREMSHEP: FaYuM This is indeed the truth.\nDOCTOR: Really? Fayum, I must say you've changed your tune. One\nDOCTOR: moment you don’t want to be Pharaoh, the next you have to do your duty. You changed your mind quickly — and literally too. I imagine.\nHOREMSHEP: You have interfered enough. Stand aside or be killed.\nDOCTOR: Why doesn't Fayum move me?\nDOCTOR: 41\nFAYUM: As you wish.\nFAYUM: suddenly falls back, gasping.\nHOREMSHEP: What are you?\nDOCTOR: More than a match for Fayum, it seems. Mind over matter, wouldn’t you say?\nHOREMSHEP: Guards! Kill him.\nDOCTOR: Wait. I can prove that Erimem is the true Pharaoh.\nHOREMSHEP: You lie! ;\nDOCTOR: I leave that to the experts. You claim your proof is from\nDOCTOR: the gods. Then let the gods choose who should be Pharaoh. HOREMSHEP The gods have chosen.\nDOCTOR: Ask Ra, the Sun God, if he favours Fayum.\nERIMEM: Peri, what is he doing?\nPERI: I don’t know. Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Shh, Peri.\nPERI: But...\nDOCTOR: Look, this is a telepathic inhibitor circuit. If I just reverse the inhibitor cache control and... there we are.\nPERI: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Quiet. I need to concentrate. Now, get him to ask the question.\nPERI: Ask your god, Horemshep - or are you scared of the answer?\nHOREMSHEP: Great Ra, bringer of life, shine your favour on the true living god, Fayum.\nHOREMSHEP: Screams and uproar.\nANTRANAK: {Ra is gone. The sky is dark. Ra has abandoned Fayum.\nDOCTOR: (Straining) Erimem, command the sun to return.\nERIMEM: Doctor, I cannot...\nDOCTOR: Do it. I can't keep this up much longer.\nPERI: Trust him. Please. Do it.\nERIMEM: Very well. Great Ra, return to our skies. Bring light and\nERIMEM: life back to our lands.\nERIMEM: Sounds of awe and shock.\nANTRANAK: Ra has returned. Only a living God can command the sun.\nERIMEM: I don't believe it.\nHOREMSHEP: Don’t believe them! It’s a trick.\nHOREMSHEP: The crowd is now behind ERIMEM. They're chanting her name.\nPERI: (Quietly) What was that? An eclipse?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Not quite. You remember when the TARDIS was jolted then I said I'd reprogrammed it?\nPERI: (Quietly) Yes.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) I just did. Telepathically. I reversed these\nDOCTOR: inhibitor circuits I found in Yanis’ tent to extend my range a little. Rather\nDOCTOR: & useful little bit of equipment. At least now we know who brought us ere.\nPERI: (Quietly) You had the TARDIS block out the sun? Can it do that?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) You've no idea what the TARDIS can do when\nDOCTOR: she has a mind to. She'd get to just the right distance for the right effect\nDOCTOR: and, so long as it wasn't for more than a few seconds, well, instant ipse.\nDOCTOR: 42\nPERI: (Quietly) All that shaking about in the TARDIS earlier? The heat... that was just now?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Yes, we're here and we were just up there, too.\nPERI: (Quietly) I think Horemshep's going to have a fit, by the way...\nHOREMSHEP: It’s a trick. A lie.\nHOREMSHEP: DOCTOR The lies are yours, Horemshep. You had Varela poisoned.\nHOREMSHEP: She was an easy target - a woman depressed and distressed by the death of her husband. She would easily trust the Priest of Horus. You forged the letters found in her rooms. You planted the evidence on Antranak. You even arranged for the assassination attempt on Erimem so that you could put Fayum or anyone else you could manipulate on the throne. Then what? Murder Fayum and take the throne yourself with the help of the mercenaries outside the city?\nERIMEM: Release Antranak.\nANTRANAK: Traitorous dog! The beetles will eat you alive for this.\nDOCTOR: First things first, however. We need to know the details of\nDOCTOR: his arrangement with Yanis’ mercenaries.\nERIMEM: Is this true, Horemshep? It is. I see it in your face.\nDOCTOR: What other reason is there for Yanis not attacking yet? The mercenaries stayed outside the city as a constant visible threat, while Horemshep here stirred up trouble inside the Palace. But there’s more to it than that now, isn't there, Horemshep?\nDOCTOR: Sound of a sword being drawn.\nHOREMSHEP: Indeed there is! Fayum!\nPERI: yelps as she’s grabbed.\nDOCTOR: Peri!\nERIMEM: Release her, Fayum.\nFAYUM: Give us free passage from the city or I open the girl's throat to the bone.\nANTRANAK: You will never leave this room alive, boy.\nDOCTOR: He means it, Antranak. Let them go.\nERIMEM: Do it.\nANTRANAK: (Reluctantly) Let them pass.\nDOCTOR: Don't provoke them.\nHOREMSHEP: Very wise, stranger. Your strength and intelligence will be of great use to us when we take the city.\nFAYUM: We will take a chariot. Keep well back or the girl dies. Doors open, PERI dragged out.\nERIMEM: Doctor... what now? I am...\nDOCTOR: Confused, have a hundred questions to ask and don’t know what to do next?\nERIMEM: ‘Yes.\nERIMEM: DOCTOR The first thing is to mobilise every soldier you have - and\nERIMEM: every chariot. I think war’s about to be declared — and I don’t want Peri on their side of the lines when the fighting starts.\nERIMEM: 36. The chariot. Peri is struggling and fighting. The chariot starts to move as:\nERIMEM: 4B\nFAYUM: Ha! Ha! ;\nHOREMSHEP: Stop struggling, girl. ; :\nPERI: Not on your life. Once you’re clear of the city, you don’t need a hostage.\nHOREMSHEP: You have a sharp mind.\nHOREMSHEP: PERI And a hard knee.\nHOREMSHEP: groans as we hear PERI knee him. Probably somewhere really sore. ;\nHOREMSHEP: (In 2 considerable amount of pain) Stop!\nPERI: Not a chance.\nPERI: Sound of PERI leaping off the chariot. She hits the ground hard. She coughs and splutters as feet run towards her. The chariot rattles off into the distance,\nDOCTOR: Peri, are you all right? You could have been killed jumping off a chariot moving that fast.\nPERI: I think I swallowed half the desert. And a few cuts and bruises.** Nothing that kicking those two where it hurts won’t cure.\nDOCTOR: Nothing wrong with your temper anyway.\nBRIMEM: Peri, I'm glad you’re safe. Antranak, how long until all\nBRIMEM: our troops can be mobilised?\nANTRANAK: My men are already armed_and waiting. The temple guards and chariots need only a few minutes.**\nDOCTOR: Good. Tell them to head for the North Gate.\nPERI: What are you planning, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: T'll tell you after you’ve let Erimem’s doctor look at those\nDOCTOR: cuts. The last thing we need is you catching an infection. Now, Antranak, the mercenaries outnumber the troops in the city. If we fight here, we’ll lose.\nANTRANAK: Are you saying we should run like cowards?\nDOCTOR: Nothing of the sort. I’m saying we should head for Giza and meet up with the garrison there. It should take a while for the mercenaries to follow us.\nANTRANAK: After they’ve laid waste to Thebes. Pharaoh, let me lead an attack on the mercenary camp. I will wipe them from the face of your kingdoms.\nDOCTOR: You'll be slaughtered inside an hour. Erimem, you must trust me.\nERIMEM: You have never failed me, Doctor, but neither has Antranak. Whatever decision I make, good people are going to die.\nPERI: Trust the Doctor, your Majesty. Please.\nERIMEM: Very well. Assemble the troops at the North Gate,\nERIMEM: Soren ~ and no arguments. Have them ready for a hard, quick march 0 Giza.\nANTRANAK: As you wish, Mighty One. I hope you know what you are doing, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So do I.\nDOCTOR: 37. The desert outside Thebes.\nDOCTOR: The mercenaries are in position. FAYUM and HOREMSHEP's chariot clatters to a stop.\nFAYUM: Whoa.\nFAYUM: 44\nYANIS: So you failed, Horemshep. I knew you would.\nHOREMSHEP: [ thought you would be pleased, Yanis. Now you will have your battle.\nHOREMSHEP: YANIS And this is?\nFAYUM: Iam Fayum.\nYANIS: I remember you. So, this pup you plan to put on the\nYANIS: throne?®® You should have told me, boy. I wouldn’t have whipped you so hard.\nFAYUM: That is unimportant now. All that matters is taking Thebes.\nFAYUM: HOREMSHEP And the Doctor.\nYANIS: My troops are prepared. Only the fair-haired stranger is\nYANIS: to be taken alive.\nHOREMSHEP: Yes, the Doctor must not be harmed...\nYANIS: No one touches him ~ he is mine. Attack now. I want to be knee-deep in Egyptian blood before the hour is out — then I'll bed the brat Pharaoh herself.°° Before I open her guts to the jackals. Attack! I can taste the blood already.\nYANIS: Cheers and yells as the troops charge. Chariots sound.\nYANIS: 38. Thebes. The North Gate. ANTRANAK is reporting to ERIMEM.\nYANIS: ANTRANAK The troops are prepared, Pharaoh, but the mercenaries are moving. on the city... But the men do not want to leave Thebes unguarded.>”\nERIMEM: We go north.\nERIMEM: DOCTOR And we’d better get going.\nPERI: Doctor, wait. Are the troops really abandoning the city? The people are terrified.\nDOCTOR: Not so much abandoning as making a strategic withdrawal, north, to Giza. I assume you're joining us?\nPERI: You think I want to be here when those mercenaries come knocking? No thanks. I’m with you.\nDOCTOR: I thought you’d say that, You’ll travel with Antranak.\nPERI: You've got it all planned.\nDOCTOR: One tries.\nPERI: Where will you be?\nDOCTOR: Well, I'll be with Pharaoh.\nERIMEM: I will need the Doctor's counsel a great deal in the coming days.\nDOCTOR: I think we’d better get moving, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Antranak, begin the march. Open the gates. Forward! Great gates creak open. The chariots and soldiers move off.\nDOCTOR: 39. Desert outside Thebes.\nDOCTOR: The soldiers are attacking. Yelling, screaming.\nYANIS: Where are they, Horemshep? You told me they would be waiting to die.\nHOREMSHEP: Their troops are ready. Don’t be so eager for battle.\nYANIS: I live for battle, imbecile, and your Egyptian troops\nYANIS: 45\nYANIS: threaten to deprive me of it. We are within sight of their gate and they have yet to fire a single arrow.\nFAYUM: It could be a trap. The Doctor is a cunning enemy.\nYANIS: Kishik? Come here, dog!\nKISHIK: My Lord Yanis, the rest of our men report the same — none of them have seen any soldiers because...\nYANIS: Where are they...?\nKISHIK: ..the Egyptian troops are leaving the city. They’re\nKISHIK: marching to Giza.\nHOREMSHEP: Call off the attack.\nYANIS: But the city is unguarded. We can take it easily.\nFAYUM: There is a greater prize than the city. 40. The trail to Giza.\nFAYUM: The DOCTOR and ERIMEM’s chariot rattles along with others doing the same in the background. A chariot closes noisily. It’s ANTRANAK - and he's excited.\nANTRANAK: Pharaoh. Pharaoh.\nERIMEM: What is it, Antranak? The mercenaries?\nANTRANAK: Our rear scouts report that the mercenaries have ignored Thebes and are following us — with their slower chariots, they are half a day behind us.\nERIMEM: Doctor?®?\nANTRANAK: You planned this.°° You knew that they would follow us and the city would be safe. I misjudged you, Doctor.” You are a true warrior.\nDOCTOR: Maybe you should think about strengthening our rear defences? Our chariots are faster then theirs but they might try a sneak attack. Hit and run, trying to pick off a few men at a time.\nANTRANAK: I will see to it now.\nANTRANAK: His chariot clatters off.\nERIMEM: Thank you. It's a great relief that Thebes is safe. Your plan worked. Why do you seem so troubled?\nDOCTOR: Because it confirms what I suspected. They knew what we\nDOCTOR: were doing. It couldn't have been their scouts. They reacted too quickly for that. I'm afraid there’s a spy among us.\nERIMEM: Who? Tell me and I will have their heart cut out.\nDOCTOR: I'd rather you didn’t. You see, I think their spy is Peri.

He is a mate of Maggie Stables and it was she who recommended him to me. He is one of a number of actors we've employed who have blown us away by the fact that the voice you hear as their character ~ in this case obviously Antranak — bears no resemblance to their real voice. Many good actors can change their voice for a few lines but to change it and keep it constant for two days, dropping into it at a moment's notice, especially recording, as we do, woefully out of order, takes skill and concentration.

How about if she pushes for the investigation of the Palace of Concubines, and cajoles Erimem into joining her? With a bit of tweaking, the scenes in the tunnels and Palace of Concubines could change emphasis so that Peri is more of the driving force. When she gets taken as a hostage in Part Three, instead of having Peri turfed off the chariot, if she broke free and jumped she'd be freeing herself without need for rescue.",

          "text": "You mentioned that you wanted a less linear plot and some kind of interaction between Peri and Antranak. Rather than have him develop a crush on her, how about if he’s wary of both Peri and the Doctor? He's been Erimem’s adviser thus far, and now she's got new favourites. He’s not jealous of Erimem (who's 17, by the way) showing them favour, but they arrived just at the right time - and that's a bit lucky for his liking. He doesn’t know anything about these people, which makes him uncomfortable. So he could be wary of Peri, try to get some answers from her about who she is, where she and the Doctor came from, etc. It would all be to protect Erimem but it would give a bit of edge to him from the listener’s point of view - he’s got a problem with Peri,so maybe he’s a bit iffy. This would give Peri the chance to stand up to Antranak when he’s niggling at her. I'd also like to add a scene where the Charioteer (the Scout) is being interrogated (tortured). Peri thinks it’s barbaric (inwardly, Erimem probably agrees) but Antranak thinks Peri’s objections to torture are a bit shady. Why doesn't she want this cnemy to be forced to tell what he knows? And when the Scout escapes, he suspects Peri even more. (Obviously it’s the Horus character who lets the Scout go.) If Anteanak’s character is that wee bit greyer and edgier, when he’s accused of the killings, for a second, we might think, yeah, it’s possible he did it to protect Erimem.The extra plotline should make scene changes easier, particularly in Parts Two and Three.",

However, I take your point about Horus being associated with Sutekh and the Osisrians in Doctor Who. The priests still retained their own names (even if they rarely used them) so there's no hassle with calling the character by his own name Chow does Horemshep sound?) - all that would need would be an early mention of him being the High Priest of Horus, and leader of the Council of Priests. d did think about calling him Anubis, but again, that’s a god's name, which might make folk think of the Osirians, and besides, everyone associates Anubis with death, so it'll be a bit of a giveaway that he’s the bad guy.) Early on, there should probably be a scene showing the enmity between Horemshep (?) and both Antranak and Fayum, (Maybe before the banquet?) This would build up both Antranak and Horemshep (and make them both greyer, rather than obviously good guys or bad guys) and it would help to establish who they are within the Palace hierarchy. Fayum would be quite low down the pecking order - but obviously basically a nice bloke who's known Erimem all her life, which would give his turn to villainy later on a bit more oomph.",

I got the impression from your notes that you weren't convinced by this bit at ali. However, if we bin the idea of him nabbing a bit of the TARDIS ev route, maybe he could use part of the stasis box for a similar purpose.

No matter how many people (or creatures) are infected, it remains a single creature, spreading out and looking for new hosts. It isn’t particularly vicious - evolution has just left it with this as its way of propagating and surviving. If needs be, to protect itself, the creature can abandon minds.

He agrees, but the fragment of the creature present in Horemshep can’t get a grasp on his mind - it’s too big. It’s the Doctor's plan - he's crying to pull all the different strands of the creature into one place so that he only has one enemy to deal with. To do that he has to let the thing get an idea of how much effort it would take to capture a Time Lord's mind. When the creature comes together in one body - Peri’s - the Doctor's plan is starting to go a bit pear-shaped. He'd expected it to be Horus or Yanis, where it has a stronger hold. But the creature knows the Doctor won't kill his friend - or anybody else if he can help it. He has to act quickly - the human brain can't deal with the sort of mental energy Peri's having to process. His plan was to lure the mind creature here and then use the telepathic inhibitor to disorient the host. Unfortunately, the inhibitor can’t handie the sheer volume of mental energy present in Peri and burns itself out. The Doctor knows he has to get the creature in Peri talking before it can take his mind. He asks it questions - lots of questions. He gets Erimem to do the same. Everyone present throws questions at the Peri host. The strain of trying to process so many questions throws the creature into distress. At first Peri can answer the questions, throwing the answers back with arrogance and disdain, but as the questions come quicker, she is in pain and the creature finds itself struggling with the limitations of the human brain. It has the memories of so many people that it can't help knowing the answers - but the human brain can’t deal with all that information at once and Peri's brain shuts down after a barrage of questions. And so everything's sorted - until a rat scuttles over and sniffs at Peri. A fragment of the creature is passed to the rat. The Doctor plonks a (canopic?) jar over the rat, trapping it.The Doctor has to get Peri and the rat to the TARDIS quickly - he can draw the mind parasite from them and store it safely until he can deliver it to the appropriate authorities. The creature makes a final bid for freedom - trying to take control of the TARDIS through the telepathic circuits, but screams in pain when it realises how vast the ship's mind (for want of a better word) is. It’s out of its depth. The Doctor comments that the TARDIS will Jock it away safely in a corner of her memory until it’s ready to go to the authorities. (Is this TARDIS scene overkill? A cop-out? It's just that, given the Doctor's hatred for taking any life, he'd probably try to keep the creature safe, no matter what instinct had made it do. But I’m not sure if the scene in the TARDIS would be necessary. Maybe it would, just to show Peri recovering and letting Erimem see a glimpse of the reality behind the Doctor's stories. Or perhaps the Doctor could comment on the creature trying to take the ship, knowing that it doesn't have a hope? He's not even slightly worried.)",

The nature of the Pharaoh involved comes into it a lot as well. If Pharach wanted to keep his women uneducated, well. that was that really. No reading. no learning, no chatting about anything interesting - just lie back and think of Egypt whenever old Pharaoh got the horn and decided it was number 47's turn.

It must have been freed when the prison ship crashed.\nERIMEM: How can such a creature exist?\nDOCTOR: It’s like a virus — an infection, reproducing itself as it passes onto another victim.

Initially, the hold will be quite weak and some of the host's personality will stay.

Evolution has made it a parasite. It needs the lives of others to carry on living. I wondered how it was passed on — but when I saw the change in Fayum after Horemshep grabbed him I realised it must be by touch.\nERIMEM: Who are you to know of these things, Doctor? No, Horemshep asked, what are you? You are not a normal man. You have fought off fatal poison and turned the sky black but I do not believe you are a god any more than J am because I don’t believe in any of our gods.\nDOCTOR: You don’t?\nERIMEM: I believe in... real things.

Do you worry that your chariots have a weak spot?\nANTRANAK: You have no need to fear an attack, Lady.

That idiot Antranak will tell her everything we need to know.\nFAYUM: She must be wary, Horemshep. If she asks too many questions he will become suspicious.\nYANIS: Hight hundred men, Fayum? Is that all they can muster?

FAYUM The Doctor must not be harmed.\nYANIS: I will cut a channel through their troops to him myself.\nFAYUM: What is he?\nHOREMSHEP: Her mind is not yet completely clear to us. She is not sure but... they travel in space. If he has a craft we will be free to colonise other worlds again.\nHOREMSHEP: 48\nHOREMSHEP: YANIS And to conquer them.®>\nHOREMSHEP: 44. The desert. Night. Sounds of the camp at rest. Fires crackle and troops move around in the background. Food is being eaten and the troops talk and laugh.\nANTRANAK: Set sentries round the camp at ten paces apart and stay alert. There you are, Doctor. Do army rations agree with you?\nDOCTOR: I've had worse, Antranak. Not hungry, Peri?\nPERI: What? No.\nERIMEM: You should try to eat something. Tomorrow will be another long march. And then there will be the battle.\nDOCTOR: (Cutting in) Here, try this.\nPERI: I said I'm not hungry.\nDOCTOR: I insist. Doctor’s orders. It'll do you the world of good. ‘You've been looking rather peaky. We'll discuss the battle after we've eaten.\nPERI: (Chewing) What is this?\nDOCTOR: Actually, it’s probably best that you don’t ask.\nPERI: (Becoming woozy) It tastes... it's...\nPERI: Sound of PERI hitting the deck.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Peri. The heat and travel have just got to you. Peri? Out like a light.\nANTRANAK: I will help you carry her to her tent.\nERIMEM: No, don’t touch her. What did you put in her food, Doctor? DOCTOR A little something I got from your physician. She'll be as\nERIMEM: right as minepence in the morning. Well, as close as she can be in the situation.© I’m going to get some blankets — we mustn't move her Would you mind explaining things to Antranak?\nANTRANAK: Let me help...\nERIMEM: No. Sit with me, old friend. I have a strange tale to tell you. The DOCTOR’s footsteps head away, leaving ERIMEM’s voice fading.\nERIMEM: We face a strange enemy, Antranak, like none even you\nERIMEM: have seen. A strange creature...\nERIMEM: 45. The desert, back a little The mercenaries are still following, but a chariot clatters to a stop. Another chariot rattles up and stops quickly.\nYANIS: Horemshep, why are we stopping? If we carry on through the night we will be close enough to attack by dawn.\nYANIS: HOREMSHEP And the men will be too tired for battle, Yanis. We will make camp here for the night, Fayum. Pass on the order.\nFAYUM: As you wish, Horemshep\nYANIS: They would cross a river of burning oil if I ordered them. FAYUM And finish as dead as they would if we marched through the night. We need living hosts not corpses.\nYANIS: Cowards. You are not fit for the prize ahead of us. Enjoy\nYANIS: your sleep. I'll set sentries for the night. Kishik? To me, you dog, to me! His chariot rattles off.\nFAYUM: Yanis is dangerous, Horemshep. His will is strong. Control over his mind is limited. We should kill him.\nFAYUM: 49\nFAYUM: HOREMSHEP In time he will be with us fully. Until then we must curb his violent ideas.\nFAYUM: FAYUM And if he continues to resist our will?\nHOREMSHEP: Then we will remove our presence from his mind before his body is killed.\nHOREMSHEP: 46. Desert. Next morning. The chariot clattering through the desert.\nERIMEM: We should be within sight of the tombs of my ancestors any time now.\nDOCTOR: You're remarkably bright today, Majesty, especially given how late you had me tell stories last night.\nERIMEM: Your stories cheer me, Doctor. They give me some hope\nERIMEM: that our cause is not so desperate. After all, we do not face, what was it, Daleks? And Cybermen? And —\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, 1 think I may have said a little more than I intended. Ah. There. The pyramids. No matter how often I see them they never fail to impress.\nDOCTOR: Can you believe they are hundreds of years old?\nDOCTOR: They’re built to last - the Sphinx even more so.\nERIMEM: I have often wondered whose face is on the Sphinx. My teacher believed it was Cheops.\nDOCTOR: Definitely not Cheops - although I have heard some bizarre stories about him.\nERIMEM: Would it surprise you to know that I am terrified, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I'd be surprised if you weren’t.\nERIMEM: Doctor, last night, you told stories of many times and\nERIMEM: places...°” Do you really know all these things? Do you know what will happen in the battle today? (No answer) What will happen to me?\nDOCTOR: Even if I knew exactly what happens today, I couldn’t change it. Whoa there.°*\nDOCTOR: The chariot stops. They both get off, jumping onto the sand.\nDOCTOR: Down you come.°*\nERIMEM: I will die today.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t say that.\nERIMEM: Your face did.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know that you’ll die.\nERIMEM: But I will never be Pharaoh. You told Peri that you knew the names of every Pharaoh. I am not one of them.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nERIMEM: It’s strange — I’m not surprised. I have always been sure\nERIMEM: that I would never be Pharaoh. Perhaps I do have a destiny after all. But a different one than I expected.\nERIMEM: Another chariot pulls up.\nANTRANAK: Majesty, your troops at Giza wait to greet you.\nDOCTOR: So, Peri, how are you feeling now?\nPERI: Fine now. Are those barriers the best you have?\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry?\nPERI: I mean, those wooden barriers won’t hold off their heavy\nPERI: chariots for long.\nPERI: 50\nERIMEM: They will have to. They are the best we can manage in such a short time.\nANTRANAK: Majesty, the sentries have spotted the enemy massing just over the high dunes to the south.\nDOCTOR: Five miles or so. Resting before the attack, I imagine, which should give me just enough time.\nPERI: Time for what?\nPERI: DOCTOR A quick stroll under the Sphinx.\nANTRANAK: Impossible. There’s no way into the Sphinx.\nDOCTOR: Actually, there is. There’s a well four hundred metres\nDOCTOR: directly behind the Sphinx.\nANTRANAK: Useless thing.”) Dry as dust. A few of the locals throw scraps in it. They believe it’s home to sacred cats who drank all the water in it.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know about the cats but there’s no water there because it’s not a well at all. It’s a sink-shaft used by the people who built the Sphinx. It leads under the Sphinx and branches off under the pyramids as well, come to that, but it’s the Sphinx I’m interested in.?*\nPERI: Why? What’s under there?\nDOCTOR: Well, contrary to the common belief of your time, the Sphinx is much older than the pyramids, dating back to around ten thousand BC.\nERIMEM: BC?\nDOCTOR: Another time. Anyway, the Sphinx was built by refugees from Atlantis, who placed all their knowledge in a chamber between the paws of the Sphinx — the Hall of Records.” We'll find what we need to beat the mercenaries and their infection down there.\nANTRANAK: How can you know all this? These tombs are at least a thousand summers old.\nDOCTOR: Well, I am a little older than I look. Right, I’d better get started. Peri, you stay by the river. If things go badly, there'll be boats heading for safety.\nPERI: I'd rather stick with you.\nDOCTOR: Well, if you're sure... Good luck, Doctor. DOCTOR And to you. To all of us.\nDOCTOR: 47. The desert outside Giza.\nFAYUM: If there is a weapon, he cannot be allowed to find it.\nYANIS: How can he be so old?\nHOREMSHEP: He is an alien and a time traveller.\nHOREMSHEP: FAYUM The girl has heard of Atlantis. He must be stopped. We\nHOREMSHEP: maust attack immediately.\nHOREMSHEP: HOREMSHEP The troops are still weary after the long march.”*\nYANIS: They fear me more than death. (Bellowing> You've rested long enough, pigs. Rouse yourselves. We attack now!\nYANIS: 48. Giza. ANTRANAK and ERIMEM are ready and waiting.\nANTRANAK: They are beginning their attack.\nANTRANAK: 51\nERIMEM: Our troops know what they must do? na\nANTRANAK: Avoid hand to hand contact with the enemy at all cost.\nANTRANAK: This is a dishonourable enemy. One that hides out of sight within others.\nEBRIMEM: But it is still an enemy to be defeated. If we all play our art.\nANTRANAK: Pharaoh, what are you doing?\nANTRANAK: Sound of ERIMEM putting on a heavy crown ~ more a helmet, really.\nERIMEM: I did not bring the battle crown for show and I cannot ask\nERIMEM: my men to go into battle while 1 watch safely from a distance. I am\nERIMEM: proficient with the bow and battle spear. You were a good teacher. I will\nERIMEM: lead the attack.\nANTRANAK: Your father would be proud of you.\nERIMEM: Only if we win the day.\nANTRANAK: Pharaoh? Their chariots!\nERIMEM: Do it.\nANTRANAK: Archers, ready... Ready... Fire! The sound of the chariots is getting closer then volley of arrows whistles away.\nANTRANAK: 49. The desert. YANIS, FAYUM and HOREMSHEP are observing the battle.\nANTRANAK: FaYuM Their archers are cutting our chariots down like cattle, Horemshep, while ours hit only those barricades.\nANTRANAK: HOREMSHEP The chariots are almost too close for the archers now — and we still have enough to over-run them.”\nYANIS: Kishik’s infantry will break through their lines easily. And then the Doctor will be ours. Infantry, forward!\nYANIS: 50. The sink shaft. PERI and the DOCTOR are climbing down ropes. Their voices echo in the shaft.\nDOCTOR: You know, this shaft is deeper than I remember. How are you doing with the ropes? (No answer) Peri? I asked...\nPERI: Fine, Doctor. How much further?\nDOCTOR: These torches don’t give much light, but it shouldn't be\nDOCTOR: far now. Ah. There we are. Careful. Another ten feet... five... there. He drops to the ground. PERI lands next to him. We hear meowing cats. One is louder than the rest.\nDOCTOR: Well, there are definitely cats here. Hello, puss.\nDOCTOR: The cat spits and hisses, scratching the DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: Ow. Not house-trained obviously.\nPERI: This way?\nDOCTOR: When it branches, we go straight on. Keep your torch up\nDOCTOR: ~ there’s no way of knowing what sort of damage time has done down\nDOCTOR: here. These tunnels are millennia old. The slightest disturbance could Cause a cave-in.\nDOCTOR: 51. Giza. The chariots are much closer. Arrows still whistle out from the archers.\nDOCTOR: 52\nANTRANAK: Their chariots are too close for the archers to be of any effect now, Pharaoh.\nERIMEM: Have the archers concentrate on their foot-soldiers. The chariots are our task now.\nANTRANAK: Archers, target their infantry. Chariot squadrons, attack in formation now!\nANTRANAK: The Egyptian chariots speed off to meet the attacking mercenary chariots.\nANTRANAK: 52. The desert.\nANTRANAK: YANTIS and his troops are charging forward. His chariot clatters forward.\nKISHIK: My Lord, we are winning\nKISHIK: Y¥ANIS Of course, Kishik. These Theben dogs are weak!\nKISHIK: Forward. Cut them to pieces! Slice through — uhh\nKISHIK: Kishik is hit by an arrow\nYANIS: Kishik!’? You will be avenged! Kill them all, kill them all!\nFAYUM: No, Yanis! We need them alive. Yanis!\nFAYUM: 83. The battle at Giza.\nFAYUM: The battle is joined. It’s loud and violent. Swords clash, chariots clatter across the battlefield. Soldiers yell and scream as they are cut down. ANTRANAK and ERIMEM hold a yelled conversation as they continue fighting — thrusting with sword and spear.\nANTRANAK: They are pushing us back, Majesty.\nERIMEM: Hold the line. The Doctor needs more time.\nANTRANAK: We need the foot-soldiers.”* They could become infected but we'll be overrun in minutes without them\nERIMEM: Very well. Bring forward the infantry.\nANTRANAK: Majesty. INFANTRY FORWARD!\nERIMEM: Let’s hope we give the Doctor the time he needs.\nERIMEM: Loud yells and cheers as the infantry run into battle. Swords clash and men scream.\nFAYUM: Over there. It’s Erimem.’?\nYANIS: She fights like a demon.\nYANIS: HOREMSHEP The Doctor. Concentrate on finding the Doctor!\nYANIS: roars disapproval. The battle continues. Loud and bloody.\nANTRANAK: Majesty — Fayum and Yanis! They’re heading for the shaft. But where’s Horemshep?\nERIMEM: No matter, we must stop them. Go back for the infantry, Antranak! The Doctor needs my help. Send soldiers down after me when they get here.\nERIMEM: Sound of an arrow hitting ANTRANAK. He falls to the desert, with 2 cough.\nANTRANAK: Majes-\nHOREMSHEP: I fear he will be passing no messages for you.\nERIMEM: Horemshep, I should have expected a coward like you to attack from behind.\nYANIS: I'll open her for the buzzards.\nHOREMSHEP: No, Yanis. The Doctor values her life. But if she attempts to escape break her arm. Erimem, you planned to join the Doctor below. We will all go down together.\nHOREMSHEP: 53\nHOREMSHEP: 84, The tunnel under the Sphinx. Footsteps in sand and the occasional meow of a cat.\nDOCTOR: These tunnels stretch further than I remember. Maybe I'm just not as young as I was. Or the cats have been busy digging.\nPERI: ‘What are the inscriptions on the pillars?\nPERI: DOCTOR The potted history of Atlantis and prayers that the people and knowledge of Atlantis will be remembered.\nPERI: What wisdom? Is it the weapon you're looking for?\nDOCTOR: There are lots of different kinds of weapons, Peri. Not far now. Ah. There we are.\nDOCTOR: PERI A blank wall?\nDOCTOR: Only to those who don't know what they're looking for.\nDOCTOR: It’s the door to the hall of records. Hold the torch steady.\nPERI: Open it.\nDOCTOR: All in good time. This door hasn’t been opened in eight and a half thousand years. It’s not the sort of thing you want to rush.\nHOREMSHEP: Open it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Horemshep. 1 was wondering when you would turn up. And you too, Fayum.\nHOREMSHEP: Open the door. We must have the weapon.\nDOCTOR: Hand over a weapon to a grubby little mind parasite like you - and a criminal to boot? I don't think so, somehow.\nYANIS: Open the door or I will snap the girl's neck.\nDOCTOR: Erimem?\nERIMEM: (Choking) Don't give it to them.\nYANIS: QUIET!\nERIMEM: gurgles as she's being throttled.\nDOCTOR: All right. All right. Just don’t hurt her.\nFAYUM: Is this a trap? Tell me.\nDOCTOR: Suddenly I don't feel all that chatty, Fayuwm.\nHOREMSHEP: Then we will take the knowledge from your mind. If you resist, Yanis will snap Erimem’s neck.\nERIMEM: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Erimem. All right, Horemshep. I won’t fight you. dust don’t harm her.\nHOREMSHEP: Let us into your mind, Doctor. When you are part of us, we will spread across eternity.\nPAYUM: His mind is vast.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nYANIS: We must have his mind.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I’m using it at the moment.\nDOCTOR: HOREMSHEP With your knowledge we can spread across the planet. We can have all planets, all times. We can be supreme.\nDOCTOR: None of you are strong enough to take my mind from me.\nHOREMSHEP: Wo single one of us it is true — but for all we are many, we are one mind.\nHOREMSHEP: Sort of swirling sound effect.\nHOREMSHEP: FAYUM And we will come together to take your mind.\nERIMEM: Doctor, what’s happening?\nERIMEM: More swirling, mixed with demonic screams and wails and the chattering\nERIMEM: 54\nERIMEM: of thousands of voices. FAYUM groans and collapses. YANIS yells and follows suit.\nDOCTOR: All the different fragments of the parasite are leaving the other hosts - human, insect, everything - and coming together in Horemshep so that he can take my mind.\nHOREMSHEP: Nearly, Doctor, but I am not the host.\nHOREMSHEP: With a loud groan, HOREMSHEP collapses.\nPERI: (Voice distorted) I am.\nDOCTOR: Peri? No! This isn’t how it’s supposed to happen.\nPERI: You will not fight your friend. You care too much for life. That is why you will lose.\nPERI: bpocTOoR Let her go.\nPERI: Do you threaten me? This one believes that you would have a plan of some kind.\nDOCTOR: So Peri's thoughts are still in there.\nPERI: Do you have a plan?\nPERI: DOCTOR An offer. Now that you've left the minds of all the people you've affected on Earth, I can take you off the planet.®\"\nPERI: Transport? To where?\nDOCTOR: There are any number of uninhabited worlds...\nPERI: No. We need... I need new bodies so that I can grow.\nDOCTOR: Worlds with non-sentient life, then.\nPERI: How could I exist inside a blank mind? That would be worse than death.\nDOCTOR: Would it be any worse than you’ve done to people here? Taking their bodies and wiping their minds? Leave Earth. Please.\nPERI: No. (Almost seductive) Give yourself to us, Doctor. You can become greater than even you can imagine.\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid you leave me no choice.\nDOCTOR: Sound of the DOCTOR fumbling with a piece of equipment.\nDOCTOR: ERIMEM The talisman you used to block out the sun.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The telepathic inhibitor. When I activate this, it'll disorient the creature in Peri's mind until I deliver it to the appropriate authorities.\nPERI: (More like PERD Doctor, don’t. Please?\nDOCTOR: No, you can’t trick me that easily. Goodnight.\nDOCTOR: Sound of the circuits being activated. PERI gasps and yells — but doesn’t collapse.\nPERI: I am still here.\nDOCTOR: Full power.\nPERI: I am too strong for the machine. You cannot defeat me. You have lost, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Erimem, how are Fayum and Horemshep?\nERIMEM: Fayum's in a daze but Horemshep has fled.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t working quite as I planned.\nPERI: You are beaten, Doctor. Accept the fact. I have the knowledge of thousands to call upon. Even you can’t defeat that.\nDOCTOR: Can't I? Thousands, you say? I wonder... Who are you?\nPERI: T have no name. J am...\nDOCTOR: I'm not asking you. I’m asking the memories you've\nDOCTOR: taken. Who are you? Peri, I know you're still in there. Who are you, Peri?\nPERI: Peri Brown.\nPERI: a a\nDOCTOR: Who else? You have the memories of thousands. Who else\nDOCTOR: are you? i\nPERI: (Voice sounding different - a different personality) Ebren.\nDOCTOR: Who are you, Ebren? What do you do?\nPERI: I’m a farmer. I raise sheep. I...\nDOCTOR: Who else is there? Tell me who you are. All of you.\nPERI: I am Ebren.. I am... (Her voice changes as different personalities are brought to the fore) ...Shemek.\nERIMEM: He was my teacher.\nDOCTOR: Ask him a question. Anything. Quickly.\nERIMEM: Where did you give me my lessons?\nERIMEM: PERI/SHEMEK In the gardens, of course. You liked the smell of the flowers. And you could see what was happening in the palace. You always were one for gossip and the like.\nDOCTOR: (Talking over PERI/SHEMEK) Another question, Erimem.\nERIMEM: What was my favourite lesson? Do you remember? PERI/SHEMEK Of course I do. You always wanted to hear more of the\nERIMEM: history of our people. You made me tell stories to you long after I should have gone home.\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupting) Ebren, who told you stories? Did your parents tell you stories when you were a child?\nPERI: (Voice switches to PERI/EBREN voice) My father until he died, and then my mother. I told stories to my son...\nDOCTOR: (Over PERI/EBREN) Ask Shemek more questions, Erimem. As many as you can think of. As varied as you can.\nERIMEM: Shemek, do you remember when I fell from a tree? PERI/SHEMEK (Switching voice again) I thought you had died, little one.\nDOCTOR: Ebren, where do you live?\nDOCTOR: PERI/EBREN On the edge of the deserts...\nERIMEM: Shemek, where do you live?\nPERI: /SHEMEK In the...\nDOCTOR: Ebren, who lives with you?\nDOCTOR: PERI/EBREN My son and...\nERIMEM: What was your wife’s name, Shemek?\nERIMEM: PERI/SHEMEK Nefral, she died...\nDOCTOR: Peri, where do you live? Who lives there with you?\nERIMEM: Who are your sons, Shemek?\nDOCTOR: Where did you go to school, Peri? Where did we meet? Ebren, tell me the names of your family.\nPERI: (Struggling with varied personalities all at ones) Four sons... Shintu... Lanzarotte, I was there on vacation with my..\nERIMEM: What's happening to her?\nDOCTOR: She's trying to deal with three sets of memories at once. The human mind wasn’t designed to do that. Keep asking them questions.\nERIMEM: What city do you live in, Peri? Tell me about it. Tell me about the people. How do they choose their leaders?\nPERI: By election every...\nDOCTOR: Ebren, you were trying to tell me about your sons. And you, Shemek.\nDOCTOR: (Struggling between personas) I have four sons... no, three and two daughters.\nDOCTOR: 56\nDOCTOR: Which is it? Are you Ebren or Shemek? Peri, keep talking about the elections.\nPERI: I have... we have votes every...\nDOCTOR: ‘Your sons! How many.\nDOCTOR: ERIMEM The election, Peri.\nPERI: There’s too much.\nDOCTOR: She can’t cope with it. Time to finish it. Who else can hear\nDOCTOR: me? How many of Yanis' mercenaries are there? How many more are you? Answer me. Who are you? Tell me. Tel! me your names. All of you.\nPERI: (Voice changing constantly — becoming frantic) Amerit, Tushka, Shemek, I’m Shemek, I’m... Corfret, no, Merenhapsut, Ebren. Peri. I’m Peri. I’m Peri Brown. I’m... Silliphar, Moeshba, Fullin, I’m...\nDOCTOR: Who are you? Who are you? Where do you come from? Where do you live?\nDOCTOR: What's your name? Who was your mother?\nERIMEM: What did you eat last?\nDOCTOR: Where were you born? Who do you love?\nDOCTOR: WHO ARE YOU?\nPERI: Closing contro! — too many Personalities) I'm... lam... my children... I... I can’t... too many voices. Too much.** I can’t... Too many.\nPERI: Too much... TOO MUCH!\nPERI: With a loud, pained yell, PERI collapses and hits the ground.\nERIMEM: Is she dead?\nDOCTOR: Unconscious. Her mind couldn’t cope with a thousand sets of memories and shut down. No, don’t touch her. Keep back. At least until the inhibitor’s switched on.\nDOCTOR: Sound of telepathic inhibitor being switched on.\nDOCTOR: There. That should.\nDOCTOR: A cat meows.\nDOCTOR: No! Shoo. Get away from her.\nDOCTOR: The cat spits and hisses.\nDOCTOR: Keep away from the cat. The entity’s passed a fragment\nDOCTOR: of itself into that. Come here, you little brute. Ah. Missed. I need something to catch him in.\nERIMEM: My cloak.\nERIMEM: Cloak is removed and thrown to the DOCTOR. The cat spits and hisses.\nDOCTOR: Got it. Come on, come on. Gently. Gently.\nDOCTOR: Cloak is thrown. The cat sounds even more agitated.\nDOCTOR: Got you. Calm down. I’m not going to hurt you. Just tie the inhibitor round your neck and... There. That’s better, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: The cat spits and slashes the DOCTOR — it just plain doesn’t like him.\nDOCTOR: Ow.\nERIMEM: Give him to me, Doctor. You tend to Peri.\nDOCTOR: Be careful. He's...\nDOCTOR: The cat purrs contentedly.\nERIMEM: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Never mind. Peri? Peri? Out cold. Good. I think we should get ou — oof\nDOCTOR: He is knocked aside\nYANIS: What has happened? My head is...\nYANIS: DOCTOR The least of your worries, Yanis. Go now.\nYANIS: 5-\nYANIS: You have done this to me. I will cut you apart and let the cats feed.\nDOCTOR: Yanis, we don’t have time for this.\nYANIS: You still have an enemy here, Doctor.\nYANIS: FAYUM And you have one here, Yanis.\nYANIS: Quiet, boy. You'll die once I’ve dealt with these. I can still have Egypt - when your Pharaoh is dead.\nFAYUM: You will not harm her.\nFAYUM: Yanis roars, draws his sword and swings it. It hits another sword.\nYANIS: What? You, boy? Fighting me? I should have killed you back in my camp.\nFAYUM: You are welcome to try again.\nFAYUM: Swords clash.\nERIMEM: Fayum is a strong fighter, Doctor, but he can’t hold Yanis for long. We must finish this quickly.\nDOCTOR: Erimem, go. Take the cat and go. I’ll bring Peri as soon as I can, Just go.\nYANIS: T'll catch you, girl. You won’t get far.\nFAYUM: Further than you.\nFAYUM: Sound of a sword being stuck into YANIS - he roars.\nYANIS: You? You've...\nYANIS: lurches hitting a pillar. The roof cracks loudly and ominously. FAYUM The roof.\nDOCTOR: It’s millennia old. There’s no telling the damage he did when he stumbled against the pillar.\nFAYUM: I should finish him.\nFAYUM: Another crack.\nDOCTOR: There’s no time for that. Go. Go.\nDOCTOR: FAYUM'’s footsteps head along the passage. The DOCTOR hefts PERI and follows.\nDOCTOR: Up. Come on, Peri.\nYANIS: (Gasping in pain) Run, pigs. I'll find you. Pll track you down and slaughter y—\nYANIS: Major crack in the roof. YANIS yells as the roof collapses on him.\nYANIS: SS. Giza.\nYANIS: ERIMEM and FAYUM are above as the DOCTOR climbs out of the sink- hole with PERI.\nERIMEM: Doctor, when the ground shook I feared the worst. It even cracked the face from the great Sphinx.., I am pleased you are both alive.\nDOCTOR: We'll be right as rain as soon as I’ve had the TARDIS\nDOCTOR: purge the creature from Peri and your cat.°* What about the battle? ERIMEM The mercenaries have fled. But there has been enough death today. Let them go.\nANTRANAK: = Even this one, Majesty? I saw Horemshep climb out of the well. I persuaded him to stay.\nEBRIMEM: Antranak! Oh Antranak, I feared you were dead.®®\nANTRANAK: Merely a flesh wound, your majesty. It takes more than that to keep me down when I have a Pharaoh to protect.\nHOREMSHEP: Majesty... Pharaoh, it wasn't my doing. The demon creature made me do this.\nHOREMSHEP: 58\nERIMEM: Send him to Thebes in chains. Let him answer to a\nERIMEM: court.\nERIMEM: FaYuM And me?\nDOCTOR: You were hardly responsible for your actions.*” And you did save us from Yanis.\nERIMEM: You committed no crime, Fayum.\nANTRANAK: You fought Yanis? And won?\nFAYUM: I’m more surprised than you are, Antranak.\nANTRANAK: I doubt that. I’ have to be careful when I argue with you in future.\nERIMEM: There was no weapon below, Doctor, was there? It was just a lure to isolate the creature in one body.\nDOCTOR: That would be telling.\nANTRANAK: What are your orders, Pharaoh?\nERIMEM: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Home, I think.\nERIMEM: Home.\nERIMEM: 56. Thebes.\nERIMEM: ERIMEM’s palace. Much cheering and victorious yelling. A triumphant fanfare outside. The TARDIS door opens, the DOCTOR and PERI emerge.\nPERI: Honestly, Doctor, I’m fine. Don’t fuss. You’ve been asking how I feel every hour on the hour since we got back to Thebes.\nDOCTOR: Well, you had quite an ordeal.\nDOCTOR: PERI And I’m fine now.\nERDVEM: I am pleased to hear it.\nDOCTOR: It sounds like the people are waiting for you, Pharaoh. They're eager to celebrate your victory.\nPERI: Look at the size of that crowd.\nERIMEM: I don't fee] like celebrating a battle that cost untold lives. PERI At least now you can be Pharaoh.\nERIMEM: No. I can never be Pharaoh, can I, Doctor?\nPERI: Why not? Don’t tell me — history. So Erimem went through all this for nothing?\nDOCTOR: You could stay and be Pharaoh. I won't stop you.\nERIMEM: TI have done my duty. Egypt is safe and Fayum will make an excellent Pharaoh — though he doesn't know it yet.\nPERI: But he’s not really your brother!\nERIMEM: So? He will still make a better Pharaoh than I.\nPERI: Where will you go?\nERIMEM: North, to one of the islands. Or perhaps Greece. No one will know me there. I can study and learn.\nDOCTOR: It may not be that easy. Your face is already on coins and works of art.\nPERI: We could take you somewhere. Couldn’t we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely not. It’s out of the question.\nPERI: Why? You said yourself, there’s nowhere civilised here she can go without being recognised.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but that’s hardly a good enough reason for me to\nDOCTOR: take her off through time and space.\nERIMEM: What will I do if I stay here?

Instead Peri gave them very exact images of a king to work from.\nPERI: The King.\nDOCTOR: Peri, what have you done?\nPERI: It won't change anything. Napoleon's troops will still use\nPERI: the face for target practice in three thousand years’ time, so nobody will know whose face it was. Besides, the Sphinx is close to Memphis — and there’s only one king from Memphis.\nDOCTOR: Tell me you didn’t.\nPERI: (Very Elvis) Uh-huh-huh.\nERIMEM: Elvis is a very strange name for a king.\nERIMEM: Doors close and his voice is cut off.

Gary Russell: ‘We cut this as Kishik of course is never found by Erimem’s people. He goes back to Yanis, tail between this legs! On a casting note, apart from Caroline Morris, Jonathan Owen who plays Antranak was the only actor on this story I'd not worked with before, although I was familiar with his work! He won't thank me for saying this, but as a fan of terrible BBC early-Eighties soap Triangle, 1 remembered his regular stint as Peter the Purser. He is a mate of Maggie Stables and it was she who recommended him to me. He is one of a number of actors we've employed who have blown us away by the fact that the voice you hear as their character ~ in this case obviously Antranak — bears no resemblance to their real voice. Many good actors can change their voice for a few lines but to change it and keep it constant for two days, dropping into it at a moment's notice, especially recording, as we do, woefully out of order, takes skill and concentration. I have no doubt fonathan will crop up in something of mine again one day.’\nNOTES: 23. Line changed to: ‘All of those you would expect to sit in Horemshep’s shadow, hoping\nNOTES: 24.

Line changed to: ‘One of the palace women was found dead a few hours ago by her own hand.’ Cary Russell: ‘We changed this because we thought it was essential straight away to suggest that Varela committed suicide, otherwise it might have been a red herring, an additional layer of intrigue into a plot already overflowing with them.”\nNOTES: 31.

Line changed to: ‘Now my only living relation is my mother but #ew she thinks I am a god and will not look me in the face.’ Gary Russell: ‘It’s @ tiny change, but the removal of the word “now” changes heaps about the culture. The fact is, Erimem’s mother would have thought she was a god for quite @ while, whereas the “now” made it sound as if it were as a result of last night’s party, or Varela’s death. It was during the recording of this scene that I lent over to writer Iain McLaughlin and commented on how good I thought Caroline was. He agreed. And at that moment I asked if we could keep the character as a companion. I suppose it had been at the back of my mind when reading the script but I’d not seriously considered it. Shortly after, I discussed it with Jason Haigh- Ellery and he’d pondered the same thing. As he’d introduced me to Caroline in the\nNOTES: 62\nNOTES: first place, I think he was doubly pleased. We both were — I'd got a top actress and a top character and I’d made the boss happy!’\nNOTES: 36. The word ‘hey’ is said twice.\nNOTES: S37. Added dialogue — SLAVE: ‘My lord.’\nNOTES: 38.

I thought it sounded more like something those topless girls back in Part One’s party might do, but then, I would.’\nNOTES: 40.

The cliffhanger ending to Part One was extended until the end of Scene 26 (see page 33). Gary Russell: ‘This was the first Doctor Who audio that David Darlington worked on and t enjoy doing post-production with him. He lives 15 minutes away which means unlike, say Alistair Lock or Jim Mortimore or the\nERS: boys, it doesn’t take three hours just to get to their workplaces!

As you do. Thus we changed it to, “What’s a few cuts and bruises?” I think we laugh too much at crap in studio sometimes...’\nERS: 54.

Gary Russell: ‘Kishik was one of my contributions Qs script editor. lain’s scripts didn’t give the charioteer Yanis yelled at in Part One a name — and I think he did feed him to the dogs. Then as Yanis had other odd guards and charioteers to yell at in the script, I opted to keep him alive a bit longer to save an endless stream of faceless guards — although I did ask tain to supply a sufficiently Egyptian name. However, he had to go at some point, so I had him die here. Yanis was actually upset ~ i'm not sure whether it’s because he quite liked Kishak after alf or because he wanted the pleasure of feeding him to the dogs at a later stage! Danie!\nERS: Brennan, who played Kishik, had previously been in a Professor Bernice Summerfield play, and f promised him another part as a result of that. (I often use Benny plays as try-outs for bigger Doctor Who roles. Which, on reflection, seems a little rude to the Benny range. Sorry Benny!) Similarly, as soon as I read the script, 1} knew who I wanted for Yanis — the fab Harry Myers who plays Adrian Wall, father to Benny's offspring in that series. Harry is a top bloke, top actor and aff-round fun guy to have in the studio. One of a good number of regular Big Finishers employed for their talent and their ability to lighten my day just by turning up. As a director, trying to get alf this crammed into a two-day recording, having people around who just make you laugh by saying “Good Morning” are worth their weight in gold!’\nERS: 78. Line changed to: ‘We need more footsoldiers.’\nERS: 79. Line changed to: ‘Ks Erimem’\nERS: 80. Line changed to: ‘The potted history of Atlantis and prayers that the people and wisdom of Atlantis will be remembered.’\nERS: 81. Line changed to: ‘Now that you've left the minds of all the people you've affected on Barth, I can take you off this planet.’\nERS: 62. Line changed to: ‘Too many.’ Gary Russell: ‘Nicola did this live, swapping between the alien and Peri where necessary. I always prefer to do this if possible rather record things separately as it keeps the flow going for everyone else. Shemek, later on, is Doctor Who Magazine journalist Mark Wyman and f can’t recall who did Ebren. t’ve an unpleasant feeling it was me... Oh, it was.”\nERS: 83. Line changed to: ‘And you still have one here, Yanis.’\nERS: 84. Added dialogue - DOCTOR: ‘Fayum, take her arm will you?’ Gary Russell: ‘We added a line in here about Fayum in case people thought he, like Yanis, was now a red mess under a few tons of Sphinx pillar! jack Galagher, who I'd originally worked with on The Fearmonger, wasn't first choice for Fayum — I had planned to ask Jack to do the character of Sabian in Primeval, and offered Fayum to lan Hallard. tan, however, was on tour being a luwie, as they do, and so 1 swapped the parts around and jack got to go to Egypt and tan went to Traken! As it turned out, I think Lady Luck smiled on me as they‘re both better suited to the roles they ended up with. Jack, bless him, worked and worked on his script and virtually knew it off by heart by the time he turned up in the studio. I like actors like that - you get some that just turn up, having barely skimmed the first dozen pages. Then you get ones fike fack who know the story backwards and thus have no problems with out of order recording, and know exactly what's needed for each scene. That second type of actor tends to get re-employed more than the former!’\nERS: 88. The order of this line and the preceding one was changed to:\nANTRANAK: Even this one, Majesty?\nERIMEM: Antranak!\nANTRANAK: Isaw Horemshep climb out of the well. I persuaded him to stay.\nERIMEM: Oh Antranak, I feared you were dead.\nERIMEM: 86. Added dialogue - HOREMSHEP: ‘But, your Majesty, I... you don't understand, I really...’ Gary Russell: ‘I was appalled with my own script editing here — the villain of the piece doesn't get a final line! So I asked Steve Perring to ad lib — which is red rag to a bull really! I can’t recall quite how fong it went on for in the rehearsal but everyone just stopped the scene and waited patiently while\nERIMEM: 65\nERIMEM: Steve went on for what seemed like an hour begging for mercy. When he finally ran out of breath Peter, Nicola and jonathan gave him a round of applause. I'd met Steve up in Bristol when we did Seasons of Fear and we all got on with him instantly. A fab actor and another one of those mood-lightening types. He, Harry and Jonathan were like the Marx Brothers on this one!’\nERIMEM: 87. ‘Fayum, added at the beginning of the line.\nERIMEM: 88, Line changed to: ‘I'll have to be more careful when I argue with you in future.’\nERIMEM: 89. After this line, the scene switches to inside the TARDIS. Gary Russell: ‘Again, a good decision by David Darlington here to have them move into the TARDIS aurally as no one ever says, “Let’s get in the TARDIS”. I’ve always been pleased that we have post-production guys who think about things like this and thus pull my fat out of the fire. Of course, now everyone knows I’m a charlatan as a director and script-editor! Do’h!’\nERIMEM: 90. The end of this scene was slightly restructured. In the finished play, Erimem’s last line is followed by a cut to outside the TARDIS. The chamber doors then open as the TARDIS dematerialisation occurs, and the scene then continues largely as scripted. (The only change was FAYUM’s first line becoming: ‘(Breathless and excited) Pharaoh, Pharaoh, the people are... Pharaoh? Pharaoh?’\nERIMEM: 66\nEYE OF THE BEETLE: PART ONE\nEYE OF THE BEETLE: Inside his shack, an Egyptian (circa 1400 BC if we could see him) is dishing up food. We can hear him pottering with pots, bowls and testing his own cooking - a noisy slurp. His name is AMENK.\nAMENK: Not bad. Not bad at all. The sound of the door being hurled open and a small boy noisily runs in. The boy is TARSHISH.\nTARSHISH: Father! FATHER! FATHER!\nAMENK: I knew you could smell food, Tarshish. Your nose is sharper than a Nile crocodile. Sit and eat. What is it? What’s frightened you? What have you seen? If you have been stealing figs from Mulak again, not even Pharaoh could save your hide from my belt. Footsteps enter. YANIS The boy saw me.\nAMENK: Why...? Who are you?\nYANIS: Yanis. Warlord of the Scorpion tribe. Slicing blows. AMENK dead, TARSHISH soon after.\nYANIS: YANIS And soon to be Pharaoh of this miserable country. Sips the food.\nYANIS: Not bad.\nYANIS: 2. Inside the Temple at Thebes.\nYANIS: SHEMEK, an elderly priest is observing the stars and tutting. He is joined by FAYUM, a member of the Royal Court. Fayum is much younger. They are friends but talk as if at war — baiting each other. If their tone wasn’t friendly, you'd think they loathed each other.\nSHEMEK: This is not good. Not good at ali.\nFAYUM: Still muttering and watching the night skies, Shemek? How are the omens? No, don’t tell me — they’re bad.\nSHEMEK: Yes. The gods send signs in the skies that speak only of terrible things to come.\nFAYUM: Spare me your nonsense, Shemek. We are safe inside Pharaoh's own palace. Nothing can harm us here.\nSHEMEK: ‘We shall see.\nFAYUM: Your ramblings may impress the concubines and hesets\nFAYUM: but I see through them and I see through you, you old charlatan. Sleep well, old friend.\nFAYUM: FAYUM’s footsteps echo into the distance.\nSHEMEK: (Softly) And I see what awaits you, my impetuous friend. The same death awaiting us all.\nSHEMEK: 279\nSHEMEK: 3. TARDIS interior. : ; The FIFTH DOCTOR is giving PERI the ten bob tour of his beloved ship. (This is directly after Planet Of Fire, so PERI is still pretty green at this time and space travel malarkey.)\nPERI: I still! can’t believe you can fit all this into one little blue box.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we’ve barely started the tour.\nPERI: Barely started? We’ve been at it for hours. And if my mother heard me say that to a guy I’d just met she’d have a coronary on the spot.\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nPERI: Nothing. I was just saying that we’d been wandering these corridors for hours.\nDOCTOR: I thought you wanted to know your way around.\nPERI: I do, believe me, but I lost my bearings six corridors, three floors and two hours ago.\nDOCTOR: It just takes a little getting used to, that’s all. You'll know your way around in no time.\nPERI: So you really know what all these doors are?\nDOCTOR: Naturally. For instance, this is the small library.\nDOCTOR: He opens the door and we hear waves crashing on the shore.\nDOCTOR: PERI The books are going to get wet.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR: He shuts the door.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Of course, sometimes the TARDIS moves things about. Still, not to worry. A little redecorating never hurt anybody.\nPERI: A. little redecorating? You’ve got a lake in there.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. I much preferred it where it was. Where to next?\nPERI: I don’t suppose you’ve got a restaurant stashed away here? My stomach thinks my throat’s been cut.\nDOCTOR: There should be a food machine around here someplace.\nDOCTOR: I haven't used it much since Susan left...\nDOCTOR: A thud as the TARDIS lands.\nDOCTOR: We've landed.

No industrial by-products in the air? Definitely Earth. Egypt, roughly 1400BC.\nPERI: Oh, come on. Even you can’t tell all that from the air.\nDOCTOR: True, but the hieroglyphs on the wall of that house behind the TARDIS are a bit of a giveaway.\nPERI: Great. Even the Egyptians had graffiti.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. (Thoughtful Can you hear something?\nPERI: Like what?\nDOCTOR: Horses... Like...\nDOCTOR: A young woman (late teens) is yelling and shouting for her horses to stop. Her chariot is a runaway. She is HATCHEPSUT.\nHATCHEPSUT: Slow down. Whoa. Slow down, damn you.\nDOCTOR: Like that.\nPERI: Her chartot’s out of control.\nDOCTOR: She’s being chased. There's another chariot.\nDOCTOR: All through we hear HATCHEPSUT and her horses getting closer.\nPERI: They're firing arrows at her. We have to do something.\nDOCTOR: I'm thinking.\nPERI: Think faster. They’re almost on top of us.\nDOCTOR: Here. Grab that rope. Tie this end round the TARDIS.\nPERI: What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Take the other end to the far side of the breach in the wall and yank it tight after the first chariot is through. Hurry.\nPERI: I wish I had paid more attention at summer camp. This\nPERI: stuff’s so slippery.\nHATCHEPSUT: Steady. Steady.\nDOCTOR: Over here. This way. Peri, are you ready?\nPERI: Nearly.\nDOCTOR: Hurry. She's almost through. Quickly. The pounding of the horses is almost on top of them.\nPERI: There. Done. She's through. Pull it.\nPERI: The sound of the rope going taught and then a shocked yell, followed by the sound of a man in armour hitting the ground hard.\nPERI: You got him.\nPERI: The fallen man groans. HATCHEPSUT is yelling for her horses to stop.\nHATCHEPSUT: Stop. Slow now. Stop. Whoa.\nHATCHEPSUT: No use. The horses thunder on.\nDOCTOR: Her horses have been scared out of their wits. She can’t control them. Keep an eye on our friend there.\nPERI: What?\nDOCTOR: I don’t have time to argue. Someone has to stop those\nDOCTOR: horses. Tell your friend I borrowed his chariot for a few minutes.\nDOCTOR: 281\nDOCTOR: The sound of the reins being flicked and the chariot moving off again.\nDOCTOR: Hya.\nDOCTOR: The fallen man groans and mumbles.\nMAN: Wha...?\nPERI: I hope this isn’t an antique.\nPERI: The sound of a pottery jar being smashed over the man’s head. Another groan and he hits the dirt hard for the second time in under a minute.\nPERI: Sorry. That’s really gonna hurt.\nPERI: Out in the desert, the DOCTOR’s chariot is chasing HATCHEPSUT’s. If we could see them the horses would be sweating up a foam as they charge across the desert. Their hooves are pounding loudly.\nDOCTOR: Hya. HYA!\nHATCHEPSUT: WHOA. SLOW DOWN. STOP!\nDOCTOR: I’m almost there. Hang on.\nHATCHEPSUT: Whoa. Slow now..\nDOCTOR: Here. I'm bringing my chariot alongside. You'll have to\nDOCTOR: step across onto it.\nHATCHEPSUT: No.\nDOCTOR: Your horses are too frightened to stop. I’m not going to hurt you. I’m almost there. Just a little closer.\nDOCTOR: On top of the horses pounding hooves, the sound of wheels touching and sparks flying. Both HATCHEPSUT and the DOCTOR yelp.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A little too close. Gently. Gentiy. Now. Step across. Hurry, I can’t hold the chariots this close for long. Take my hand. Take it! Now jump. It’s just one step. Step now.\nDOCTOR: The sound of HATCHEPSUT leaping over and landing on the DOCTOR’s chariot.\nDOCTOR: Got you. It’s all right. I’ve got you. Whoa now. Whoa.\nDOCTOR: The chariot pulls to a stop.\nDOCTOR: Are you hurt?\nHATCHEPSUT: Stay away from me.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right. Put the knife away. I’m not going to hurt you. Though I can’t say the same for the chap I borrowed this chariot from.\nHATCHEPSUT: Where is he?\nDOCTOR: Back there. Unconscious.\nHATCHEPSUT: Good. Get me away from here.\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose you'd care to tell me why he was trying to kill you?\nHATCHEPSUT: You don’t know?\nDOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn’t ask, would I?\nHATCHEPSUT: You are a stranger here. Or an idiot.\nHATCHEPSUT: DOCTOR Of the two, I’d rather be a stranger. I’ve been to Egypt\nHATCHEPSUT: before but I don’t think I've been here recently...\nHATCHEPSUT: Take me to Thebes.\nDOCTOR: ‘You haven't answered my question.\nHATCHEPSUT: No, I haven’t. When we are safe in Thebes, I will see that your questions are answered.\nDOCTOR: All right. Hold on. Hup. Giddup.\nDOCTOR: The horses pull the chariot away.\nDOCTOR: 6. The desert. In the desert, by the TARDIS, the DOCTOR’s chariot pulls up by PERI.\nDOCTOR: 282\nDOCTOR: Whoa.\nPERI: Doctor, am I glad you're back! I’m almost out of pots to clobber this guy with.\nPERI: The man groans. Another pot smashes and he hits the ground hard again\nPERI: But I’ve still got one left.\nDOCTOR: ‘You enjoyed that too much, young lady.\nHATCHEPSUT: I hoped he would be dead.\nHATCHEPSUT: The sound of HATCHEPSUT giving her would-be killer a real good booting — well, sandaling.\nDOCTOR: Stop. There’s no need for that. Beating up an unconscious man won't solve anything.\nHATCHEPSUT: I owe him and his kind a hundred times worse.\nHATCHEPSUT: Knife pulled again.\nDOCTOR: Give me that knife.\nHATCHEPSUT: Let go of me. Give it back. Why do you protect this filth? Are you one of their number? Are you a mercenary?\nHATCHEPSUT: DOCTOR A doctor. The Doctor, actually. And I’m protecting him because I despise meaningless death.\nHATCHEPSUT: (Conceding unhappily) Get me back to Thebes. Now.\nPERI: You got her, then.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nPERI: So who is she? Why were they trying to kill her?\nPERI: I thought this guy might have been a bandit but that’s battle armour he’s wearing.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I spotted that as well. She’s not exactly the most communicative of people. We'll take her to Thebes. Rip Van Winkle with the headache as well.\nPERI: Four of us on that chariot is gonna be cramped.\nDOCTOR: We'll be all right. These war chariots were built for two passengers and I don’t think Sleeping Beauty will mind if we hang him over one of the horses.\nHATCHEPSUT: We must leave now. By now he is bound to have been missed.\nDOCTOR: That might be a good idea. I've had more than enough excitement for one day.\nHATCHEPSUT: Hurry. Or I will leave you both here.\nPERI: That’s gratitude for you.\nPERI: 7. The desert.\nPERI: Two more of the would-be assassins are observing. These are scouts.\nSCOUT: 1 The stranger has rescued her.\nSCOUT: 2 Do we attack them now?\nSCOUT: scout 1 With what? We have no arrows left. Besides, the chariot\nSCOUT: would reach the outer defences of Thebes before we could catch it. We would be tortured for answers like they will torture that poor fool.\nSCOUT: scouT2 So what do we do? scout 1 Report that she escaped. And hope that our chief spares our lives.\nSCOUT: 283\nSCOUT: 8. Thebes. The chariot rattles and chunters towards Thebes.\nDOCTOR: There it is.\nPERI: Wow.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is impressive, isn’t it?\nPERI: If Howard could see me now. He always moaned that I didn’t have any interest in history.\nDOCTOR: Where to?\nDOCTOR: HATCHEPSUT The palace.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The palace? If this is an enemy chariot, I don’t think\nDOCTOR: they'll exactly welcome us with open arms.\nHATCHEPSUT: That will not be a problem, Doctor.\nPERI: Doctor... have you noticed the people...\nDOCTOR: . are all kneeling?\nDOCTOR: PERI And bowing.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. I don’t think you told us exactly who you are.\nHATCHEPSUT: No. I did not. Stand proud and firm.\nPERI: We've got company.\nDOCTOR: Whoa, there. Whoa.\nDOCTOR: The chariot halts. More chariots rattle to join them.\nPERI: I don’t like the look of those swords, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I'm not too keen on the spears either. Best behaviour, Peri.\nPERI: You patronising...\nPERI: A man’s voice cuts across her. He sounds mid-forties - ANTRANAK, head of the palace armies. A younger man is with him - SENENMUT.\nANTRANAK: Mighty one. We sing praises to the gods for your safe\nSENENMUT: I warned you against that ride in the desert, Hatchepsut.\nDOCTOR: Hatchepsut?\nPERI: Mighty one?\nHATCHEPSUT: Remember who you are speaking to, Senenmut. Be very careful. Escort us to the palace, Antranak. We have a great deal to do but this is not the place to do it.\nANTRANAK: As you command, mighty Pharaoh.\nPERI: Pharach? Oh, God.\nDOCTOR: I should have known. Why else would they be attacking her?\nPERI: Should I be bowing or curtseying or something?\nHATCHEPSUT: Yes, but refrain from doing so. The chariot is quite smali ~and Lt would be unseemly for someone accompanying Pharaoh to fall off in public.\nPERI: Whatever you say.\nHATCHEPSUT: 1 would wager, Doctor, that you did not expect anything like this when you first saw my chariot being chased.\nDOCTOR: Er, not really, no.\nDOCTOR: HATCHEPSUT And yet you saved me without knowing who I was. Would\nDOCTOR: you have done anything differently if you had known I was to be Pharaoh. I don’t think so. Am I right?\nDOCTOR: aoe I was under the impression that divine Pharaoh is always t.\nHATCHEPSUT: I think I would do well to avoid sparring in word games\nHATCHEPSUT: 284\nHATCHEPSUT: with you, Doctor. You have no fear of me yet you don’t seek my favour either. You are a most unusual man.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nHATCHEPSUT: Now smile and wave to my people. Let them see that their divine Pharaoh is unharmed.\nHATCHEPSUT: 9. The desert. The two scouts who watched the DOCTOR rescue HATCHEPSUT are back at their camp. Waiting for them is YANIS.\nYANIS: Where are the two spineless dogs who let the whelp of a girl escape? Bring them in here.\nYANIS: Sound of the two SCOUTS being hurled into the tent. When they speak they are terrified and babble, often talking over each other and continuing the others sentences.\nGUARD: Here, sire.\nYANIS: Well, dogs? Do you have an explanation of how the Egyptian pup escaped from a squad of over a dozen chariots? Make your answer good or I will stake you in the sand and watch the buzzards feast on your eyes and innards.\nYANIS: scour 1 It wasn’t our fault, sire.\nSCOUT: 2 ‘We plead for mercy.\nYANIS: Save your pleading. I want answers. How did she escape?\nSCOUT: 2 She had a large escort. Six...\nSCOUT: scouTl1 No, ten chariots. We killed all the rest - we even got her driver.\nSCOUT: YANIS. And still she escaped? Imbeciles! Worse - cowards.\nSCOUT: 2 No, great sire. She had help.\nYANIS: What help?\nYANIS: scout i A man with long fair hair and strange clothing...\nSCOUT: 2 And a violent girl who repeatedly attacked one of our men even when he was unconscious.\nSCOUT: YANIS A girl should be no match for a man - not even one of you. idiots. Tell me about the man.\nSCOUT: sCcouUT 2 He knocked our warrior from his chariot as if by magic.\nSCOUT: 1 Pharaoh's horses were running wild but this fair haired man took our fallen comrade’s chariot and caught up.\nYANIS: Even though the Pharaoh girl’s horses were charging out of control?\nSCOUT: 2 He drove like a demon. I have never seen better. Except for you, of course, mighty Yanis.\nSCOUT: scouT 1 He even lifted the Pharaoh from her chariot with one hand.\nYANIS: Strong, is he?\nYANIS: scout 1 Yes. The strength of ten men,\nYANIS: scouT2 And tall. A head taller than most.\nYANIS: So you were afraid of this mighty, fair giant? That is why you didn’t attack.\nSCOUT: 2 No, great chief. They were too far away. We could never have caught them before they reached Thebes.\nSCOUT: scout 1 We thought it best to return and tell you what had happened.\nSCOUT: 285\nYANIS: What has happened is that now that inbred whelp who calls herself Pharaoh knows that we are here and she knows that we will attack sooner rather than later. She is wily as a fox. She will be preparing for us. Get out. All of you.\nGUARD: Yes, great chief. What of these two?\nYANIS: Slit them open and let the dogs feed. They are worse than useless.\nYANIS: scouT1 No, great Yanis. Mercy, please.\nSCOUT: 2 L have a wife and four children at home. Let me live. I will not fail you again.\nSCOUT: scouT 1 And I am loyal. I have always been loyal to you.\nSCOUT: YANIS And to my predecessor who, as I remember, you helped me murder. Guard, leave them here. I will let them live — but at a price.\nSCOUT: 1 Anything.\nSCOUT: scouT2 Yes, but please. Please let us live.\nYANIS: Guard, go.\nYANIS: Sound of tent flap rustling as the Guard leaves.\nYANIS: So you want to live?\nSCOUT: 2 Yes, sire.\nSCOUT: scout 1 We'll do anything...\nYANIS: One of you will live.\nYANIS: Sword drawn. Thrown into the ground.\nYANIS: Fight — to the death. I will let the winner live.\nYANIS: SscouUT1 Fight each other?\nYANIS: Or will I have you both sliced open?\nSCOUT: 2 L.. we...\nSCOUT: Sound of the two men suddenly leaping for the sword - a fight. Yanis hugely enjoys the spectacle.\nYANIS: If you provide some entertainment you might prove to be\nYANIS: of some use.\nYANIS: Fight continues.\nYANIS: 10. The Palace at Thebes.\nYANIS: The DOCTOR is calling for PERI.\nDOCTOR: Are you ready yet?\nPERI: Tl be out in a minute.\nDOCTOR: Do try to hurry. It’s considered bad form to keep the ruler of the known world waiting in her own palace.\nDOCTOR: ane Okay, okay. Here I come, ready or not. Well? What do you\nDOCTOR: You've been busy.\nPERI: Not me. I’ve had half a dozen servants helping me bath —\nPERI: and that was only hugely embarrassing — dress, put this stuff on my eyes...\nDOCTOR: Kohli. It’s used to make the sloe-eyes shape.\nPERI: I know. My stepfather is an archaeologist, remember? This dress shows a bit more... you know... than I’d like, but hey. When in Egypt. I see you’ve made absolutely no effort to blend in.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know what you mean. This jacket is a classic.\nDOCTOR: PERI At least you didn’t have servants trying to shave your head.\nDOCTOR: It’s the fashion. Shall we? is\nDOCTOR: 286,\nDOCTOR: 11. The Palace at Thebes. There are the rumblings of a large gathering.\nPERI: Now this is what I call a party. Is this all for us? bDocTOR Shush. I think we're on.\nSENENMUT: (Grandiy) The great and mighty queen, daughter of the stars. All bow to Pharach Hatchepsut, divine and eternal, the living god.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Feri, kneel.\nPERI: I'd like to see you kneel in a dress this tight — actually, no I wouldn't.\nSENENMUT: Rise and approach Pharaoh, Doctor.\nSENENMUT: Slight delay while the DOCTOR and PERI approach the throne. HATCHEPSUT The Doctor and Peri have done great service to your Pharaoh and to Egpyt. As thanks, Doctor, I give you this cartouche bearing my divine name. It marks you as friend of Pharaoh and under my divine protection.\nDOCTOR: You do me great honour, mighty Pharaoh.\nHATCHEPSUT: Now let the banquet begin.\nHATCHEPSUT: A walloping great gong.\nHATCHEPSUT: You will sit by Pharaoh, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nPERI: ‘Yeah. Me, too.\nHATCHEPSUT: If you wish. Hat. You could do putting some flesh to your bones. Men do prefer something more substantial, wouldn't you say, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I... never comment on a lady’s appearance. I find it much safer that way.\nPERI: Thanks a lot.\nHATCHEPSUT: You amuse me, Doctor. A warrior with a wit? I have not known such a man since my husband.\nPERI: You're married?\nHATGHEPSUT: (Very icy) Not any more.\nDOCTOR: (Quickly) Please forgive Peri’s ignorance, Majesty. We\nDOCTOR: have been travelling for a considerable time. She had not heard of your divine husband's passing.\nHATCHEPSUT: I will forgive her lapse this time, Doctor, because you ask it.\nDOCTOR: You are most generous, Majesty.\nDOCTOR: Shemek, the old astronomer and priest, speaks to Fayum, renewing their banter. Senenmut is there as well.\nSHEMEK: This cannot sit well with you, Fayum. An outsider sitting at Pharaoh's right hand.\nFAYUM: I imagine it sits less well with Senenmut.\nSHEMEK: He's a smart lad, that Senenmut, but he should learn to\nSHEMEK: be a bit more subtle when it comes to women. It doesn’t do to let them See you’re too keen. Especially when she’s Pharaoh and she’s got the temper of a trapped scorpion.\nSHEMEK: FAYUM And when she’s so interested in this newcomer.\nSHEMEK: You spotted that as well?\nFAYUM: I’m young, not blind. I think everybody with eyes in the\nFAYUM: court has noticed it.\nFAYUM: 287\nSHEMEK: He’s certainly an odd-looking sort. That fair hair - and that pale skin. Must come from far to the north. And stop staring at his woman, Fayum.\nFAYUM: She’s very beautiful.\nSENENMUT: She is indeed.\nSENENMUT: Yelps from Fayum and Shemek.\nSHEMEK: Senenmut! Must you creep around like that? I forget — you're a politician. Of course you have to creep. How long have you been skulking there?\nSENENMUT: Long enough to hear you talk about me in ways I'd rather you didn't. At least in as public a place as this.\nSENENMUT: FaYuM Oh.\nSHEMEK: Don't deprive me of my gossip. At my age, it’s one of the few pleasures I can still manage.\nSENENMUT: You may fool other people with that decrepit-old-man act, Shemek, but this is me you’re talking to. You don’t fool me.\nSENENMUT: SHEMEK And you won’t fool anyone either if you don’t stop glaring at the Doctor.\nPAYUM: You don’t like Pharaoh showing favour to this outsider.\nSENEMUT: Pharaoh makes her own decisions.\nSENEMUT: SHEMEK And you do not like them?\nSENENMUT: (Seething) To say that would be to admit treason. Everyone knows that divine Pharaoh is infallible. She is a living god, and as she so often points out, I am not even royal.\nSHEMEK: (Laughing) And I thought you a better liar than that.\nSENENMUT: Go back to your stars, old man. Or are even they tired of your prattle? The truth is that I am worried — for Hatchepsut ~ and for all of us. These are strange days.\nSENENMUT: Back at the top table, PERI is obviously having a bit of a look round.\nPERI: I wish I'd brought a camera to this shindig.\nPERI: DOCTOR And how would you explain it to the developer?\nPERI: Never been to a toga party?\nDOCTOR: Well, there was that bash Nero threw...\nPERI: What now?\nPERI: DOCTOR The entertainment.\nPERI: Dancers? Oh my gosh. They’re topless.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes they are I suppose. It’s the custom. Just ignore it if it bothers you.\nPERI: Easy for you to say. You're not being letched at by that black toothed priest over there. If he asks me to dance I'l] punch him.\nDOCTOR: You'll do no such thing.\nPERI: I'm joking. Just joking. Those other topless girls — are they the next dancers?\nDOCTOR: Ah... well, no. Actually, they're a different kind of entertainment.\nPERI: Singers? (Dawn of realisation) You don't mean... hookers? These people need a cold shower.\nDOCTOR: You may find some of their activities offensive but\nDOCTOR: remember, you're seeing them from a 20th century perspective. By this\nDOCTOR: time’s standards, being a palace servant, even in this capacity is quite respectable.\nDOCTOR: 288\nHATCHEPSUT: Are you enjoying the banquet, Doctor?\nHATCHEPSUT: Very much, your majesty. Aren’t we, Peri?\nHATCHEPSUT: Having a great time.\nHATCHEPSUT: Do any of the hesets find favour in your eye, Doctor? (Uncomfortable) They’re charming. I suppose. But I don’t - you know...\nHATCHEPSUT: You do not wish to insult Peri in public. Perhaps later.\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. Perhaps. (Changing the subject) The food is splendid.\nHATCHEPSUT: You must try the roast boar. It is absolutely excellent.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nHATCHEPSUT: (Claps hands to slave) Bring boar for my guest.\nPERI: Is now a good time to remind you that I'm a vegetarian? Doctor, that slave with the boar...\nDOCTOR: What about him? Wait, I see what you mean. His clothes\nDOCTOR: don’t quite match the others. Sound of a heavy plate being thrown aside.\nPERI: He’s got a knifel\nSLAVE: Death to Hatchepsut!\nDOCTOR: No!\nSENENMUT: Guards!\nPERI: Doctor!\nPERI: There are yells and general noises of confusion and struggle, including a ery of pain from the DOCTOR.\nHATCHEPSUT: You have saved me again, Doctor. Senenmut, Antranak! The guards are worthless! Send them to the House of Pain.\nPERI: You're bleeding.\nDOCTOR: (Obviously in a bit of pain) It’s nothing much. Just a flesh wound, really. The knife only grazed my hand.\nDOCTOR: The slave laughs.\nHATCHEPSUT: Tell me what is so funny. It will be the last thing you say before your tongue is ripped from your head.\nSLAVE: I will not die alone. The dagger was coated with poison. He has only minutes to live.\nSLAVE: {End of Part One.)\nSLAVE: 289\nEYE OF THE BEETLE: Part Two\nEYE OF THE BEETLE: 1, Recap from Part One. ; At the banquet. Sounds of general banqueting.\nHATCHEPSUT: (Claps hands to slave) Bring boar for my guest.\nPERI: Is now a good time to remind you that I’m a vegetarian? Doctor, that slave with the boar...\nDOCTOR: What about him? Wait, I see what you mean. His clothes\nDOCTOR: don’t quite match the others. Sound of a heavy plate being thrown aside.\nPERI: He's got a knife!\nSLAVE: Death to Hatchepsut!\nDOCTOR: No!\nSENENMUT: Guards!\nPERI: Doctor!\nPERI: There are yells and general noises of confusion and struggle, including a ery of pain from the Doctor.\nHATCHEPSUT: You have saved me again, Doctor. Senenmut, Antranak! The guards are worthless! Send them to the House of Pain.\nPERI: You're bleeding.\nDOCTOR: (Obviously in a bit of pain) It’s nothing much. Just a flesh wound, really. The knife only grazed my hand.\nDOCTOR: The slave laughs.\nHATCHEPSUT: Tell me what is so funny. It will be the last thing you say before your tongue is ripped from your head.\nSLAVE: I will not die alone. The dagger was coated with poison. He has only minutes to live.\nPERI: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Actually, I am feeling a little queasy, Peri.\nHATCHEPSUT: Take him to my private chambers. And be gentle with him.\nDOCTOR: Wait. What kind of poison was it?\nHATCHEPSUT: Tell him.\nHATCHEPSUT: No answer. A hefty thump.\nSENENMUT: Answer Pharaoh.\nDOCTOR: Never mind. Give me his knife.\nSENENMUT: Here.\nSENENMUT: The Doctor sniffs.\nDOCTOR: Scorpion venom? Let’s have a taste.\nDOCTOR: Sound of Doctor running finger along the blade and licking the venom.\nDOCTOR: Definitely scorpion.\nPERI: What are you doing? That’s poison.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. Fresh, too.\nSLAVE: How can you take that poison and still stand?\nSLAVE: ai Well, it would be bad manners to keel over at Pharaoh’s eet.\nSLAVE: 290\nSENENMUT: This pig will not speak here, Majesty.\nHATCHEPSUT: Torture this creature. I want to know why he tried to kill me and who sent him. Find out whe dares attack Pharaoh.\nDOCTOR: Is that really necessary? No one’s actually been hurt.\nHATCHEPSDT: He attacked me, Doctor. You may have saved my life twice but that does not give you leave to talk to me in that manner. Senenmut, I told you to torture this animal. Find out what it knows.\nSLAVE: ‘You will learn nothing from me.\nHATCHEPSUT: We shall see. Begin with castration.\nSLAVE: Before coming into the palace I took a smaller dose of the\nSLAVE: same poison that was on the knife. It is more than enough to kill me. Already I feel this world slipping away from me but I have no regrets.\nHATCHEPSUT: Who sent you?\nHATCHEPSUT: A slap.\nHATCHEPSUT: Answer me! Answer! Another slap.\nSLAVE: (Fading) The true Pharaoh.\nSLAVE: Sound of the slave hitting the floor, followed by the buzz of whispered conversation. The comment about the true Pharaoh has got a reaction from the cheap seats at the banquet.\nSENENMUT: What should we do, Pharaoh?\nSENENMUT: No answer.\nANTRANAK: Pharaoh?\nANTRANAK: There’s an air of anticipation.\nSHEMEK: (Quietly, to himself) Pharaoh...\nDOCTOR: Hatchepsut, you Must give an answer.\nHATCHEPSUT: (Confident — raging but confident) Discover what you can about this scum then throw the corpse into the Nile. And interrogate the chariot driver I captured today. Or must I do that part of your job as well? Then let the crocodiles have him. I will be in my chambers. You will accompany me, Doctor.\nSENENMUT: Take this dead scum to be examined.\nFAYUM: Senenmut. What did the killer mean when he said ‘the true Pharaoh’?\nSENENMUT: How should I know?\nFAYUM: It will be the gossip of Thebes within the hour.\nSENENMUT: I don’t doubt it.\nFAYUM: Then you must discover what he meant by true Pharaoh.\nSENENMUT: I don’t need a junior priest telling me what I have to do. I don’t like this. Mercenaries in the red desert, an assassin in the palace ~- and all when this Doctor arrives.\nFAYUM: How could he eat poison as if it was a sweet-meat?\nSENENMUT: I don’t know. But [’ll find out.\nSENENMUT: 2. Hatchepsut’s Chambers. PERI and HATCHEPSUT have arrived. A PHYSICIAN is tending the Doctor.\nHATCHEPSUT: Doctor? Doctor, are you ill?\nDOCTOR: Just the poison in my system.\nPERI: But you're going to be all right. Right?\nDOCTOR: It's giving me terrible heartburn. I’ be right as rain after\nDOCTOR: an hour or two’s sleep.\nDOCTOR: 291\nHATCHEPSUT: You. Slave. Assist the Doctor to my bed.\nDOCTOR: There’s no need.\nHATCHEPSUT: You said yourself that you need rest. Lie down.\nDOCTOR: All right.\nDOCTOR: Sound of the Doctor being lugged across and put on the bed.\nHATCHEPSUT: Do you need anything?\nDOCTOR: Something to drink wouldn’t go amiss. My throat is a little dry.\nHATCHEPSUT: I will have wine brought.\nHATCHEPSUT: Footsteps head away.\nPERI: I don’t suppose you'd tell me how you managed that trick with the poison?\nDOCTOR: That? Oh, my physiognomy is a little different from\nDOCTOR: yours. The poison’s not lethal to me — it's just given me a terrible tummy ache. (Sounding tired) I'll be fine when I wake up. Absolutely... fine...\nPERI: Doctor? Doctor?\nPERI: No answer.\nPERI: (Disgusted) Zonked.\nHATCHEPSUT: Ah, he is asleep.\nPERI: Yep. He’ll probably be snoring his head off any minute now.\nHATCHEPSUT: He is a brave man.\nPERI: Can't deny that. Sometimes I wish he’d think before he acts.\nPERI: HATCHEPSUT The brave do not have time to sit and think. They must act to seize opportunities when they come.\nPERI: It’s acting without thinking that’s left him needing to sleep off the poison. Not that Im complaining that he stopped the assassin. I just don't want him getting hurt, that’s all.\nHATCHEPSUT: Your care for him does you proud. Even though you are some years younger than him, I imagine he is a fine husband to you.\nPERI: Husband? Ch, no. We’re not married.\nHATCHEPSUT: What then? (Peering down her regal nose) Are you a slave? Or a concubine?\nPERI: I’m nobody’s slave. Or concubine for that matter.\nHATCHEPSUT: What then?\nPERI: We're friends. We travel together because we want to.\nPERI: Simple as that.\nHATCHEPSUT: Even though you are not his woman?\nPERI: I don’t think travelling alone appeals to him much. And I get to see the world. And anywhere else for that matter.\nHATCHEPSUT: You make no sense.\nHATCHEPSUT: PERI A lot of people say that.\nHAYCHEPSUT: You share a great affection with the Doctor, though.\nPERI: He can be a pain sometimes but it’s hard to stay mad at him for long.\nPERI: Knock at door.\nHATCHEPSUT: Enter.\nHATCHEPSUT: Door opens and footsteps come in.\nSENENMUT: Pharaoh. I am honoured to be...\nHATCHEPSUT: (Cutting across) From that grovelling start I assume you haven't discovered anything.\nHATCHEPSUT: 292\nSENENMUT: Not as much as I would have hoped.\nSENENMUT: —_ Have you found anything? Like, how did he get in for a start?\nSENENMUT: That we do know. At least in part. One of the hesets saw him coming from the Palace of Coneubines. She thought he was one of the eunuchs.\nHATCHEPSUT: If he had lived, I would have personally turned him into one before he was executed.\nPERI: Have you asked at the... what's it called?\nHATCHEPSUT: Palace of Concubines.\nPERI: Yeah. There.\nSENENMUT: That is not permitted. Other than concubines and eunuchs, only Pharaoh may enter the Palace of Concubines\nPERI: So you're not going to question them?\nSENENMUT: That would be an unacceptable breach of our laws. HATCHEPSUT And if I say it is allowed?\nSENENMUT: Pharaoh's word is law.\nHATCHEPSUT: You may enter the Palace of Concubines on this occasion, Senenmut. Peri, you will accompany him.\nPERI: Me?\nPERI: HATCHEPSUT The Doctor is your friend. Don’t you want to know how this happened?\nPERI: I guess.\nPERI: HATCHEPSUT And I think you will be less likely to be cowed by the concubines. They have lofty opinions of themselves.\nPERI: Okay. The Doctor will be okay here?\nHATCHEPSUT: I will see that he is tended to.\nHATCHEPSUT: SENENMUT With your leave, Majesty.\nHATCHEPSUT: You may go.\nSENENMUT: My queen. Come.\nPERI: I’m not a pet dog. What next? Sit? I won't be long, Doctor.\nHATCHEPSUT: He can't hear you.\nPERI: I wanted to say it anyway.\nPERI: Footsteps go. Door closes.\nHATCHEPSUT: You. Slave. Have Antranak join me at once. Perhaps Peri will be spending more time with the concubines than she expects.\nHATCHEPSUT: [End of draft.)\nHATCHEPSUT: 293\nSCRIPTING: NOTES By Iain McLaughlin\nSCRIPTING: Em McLaughlin to Gary Russell ~ Friday 8 December 2000\nSCRIPTING: More>>>\nSCRIPTING: Okay, I've just read through your notes a couple of times. For the most part I agree with your points. Some of the dialogue is ghastly and cumbersome - getting the point over but without any subtlety. I don’t remember them being so duff when I wrote the thing, but in hindsight, some of the dialogue is a bit, well, crap (and I'm probably being kind to myself there). That can be fixed.\nSCRIPTING: If you think the Doctor's dialogue has strayed from Peter Davison to Colin Baker, then that’s a bad mistake I'll need to fix. I thought the Fifth Doctor was gutsier in Peter Davison's last year (admittedly in The Caves of Androzani it was because he knew he was going to peg out), but all through that year I thought he was a stronger, firmer character and I tried to push him that way. But if I've cocked it up, it needs to be fixed.\nSCRIPTING: Peri’s dialogue can be fixed as well. Less cocky, more intelligent? Less cheap gags? Stronger and pushing the action more. How about if she pushes for the investigation of the Palace of Concubines, and cajoles Erimem into joining her? With a bit of tweaking, the scenes in the tunnels and Palace of Concubines could change emphasis so that Peri is more of the driving force. When she gets taken as a hostage in Part Three, instead of having Peri turfed off the chariot, if she broke free and jumped she'd be freeing herself without need for rescue.\nSCRIPTING: You mentioned that you wanted a less linear plot and some kind of interaction between Peri and Antranak. Rather than have him develop a crush on her, how about if he’s wary of both Peri and the Doctor? He's been Erimem’s adviser thus far, and now she's got new favourites. He’s not jealous of Erimem (who's 17, by the way) showing them favour, but they arrived just at the right time - and that's a bit lucky for his liking. He doesn’t know anything about these people, which makes him uncomfortable. So he could be wary of Peri, try to get some answers from her about who she is, where she and the Doctor came from, etc. It would all be to protect Erimem but it would give a bit of edge to him from the listener’s point of view - he’s got a problem with Peri,so maybe he’s a bit iffy. This would give Peri the chance to stand up to Antranak when he’s niggling at her. I'd also like to add a scene where the Charioteer (the Scout) is being interrogated (tortured). Peri thinks it’s barbaric (inwardly, Erimem probably agrees) but Antranak thinks Peri’s objections to torture are a bit shady. Why doesn't she want this cnemy to be forced to tell what he knows? And when the Scout escapes, he suspects Peri even more. (Obviously it’s the Horus character who lets the Scout go.) If Anteanak’s character is that wee bit greyer and edgier, when he’s accused of the killings, for a second, we might think, yeah, it’s possible he did it to protect Erimem.The extra plotline should make scene changes easier, particularly in Parts Two and Three.\nSCRIPTING: 294\nSCRIPTING: As for Horus, the chief priests of each god's temple took the name of that god and. were usually addressed by the god’s name. However, I take your point about Horus being associated with Sutekh and the Osisrians in Doctor Who. The priests still retained their own names (even if they rarely used them) so there's no hassle with calling the character by his own name Chow does Horemshep sound?) - all that would need would be an early mention of him being the High Priest of Horus, and leader of the Council of Priests. d did think about calling him Anubis, but again, that’s a god's name, which might make folk think of the Osirians, and besides, everyone associates Anubis with death, so it'll be a bit of a giveaway that he’s the bad guy.) Early on, there should probably be a scene showing the enmity between Horemshep (?) and both Antranak and Fayum, (Maybe before the banquet?) This would build up both Antranak and Horemshep (and make them both greyer, rather than obviously good guys or bad guys) and it would help to establish who they are within the Palace hierarchy. Fayum would be quite low down the pecking order - but obviously basically a nice bloke who's known Erimem all her life, which would give his turn to villainy later on a bit more oomph.\nSCRIPTING: Apart from ropy dialogue, the two main problems you mention are the ending and the idea of the Doctor using a component from the TARDIS's telepathic circuits. I didn’t explain it all that well in the script, but the Doctor sensed the telepathic presence while unconscious and realised that the component would be needed. I got the impression from your notes that you weren't convinced by this bit at ali. However, if we bin the idea of him nabbing a bit of the TARDIS ev route, maybe he could use part of the stasis box for a similar purpose. The box must have had some kind of telepathic inhibitors to keep the creature dormant. Would using that disorient Yanis and his crew tong enough for an escape? And he could tinker with it so that it would amplify his own thoughts out to the\nTARDIS: (blocking the sun, etc.). From memory, I cecall a few of the Virgin novels mentioning the tink between the Doctor's mind and the TARDIS’s telepathic circuits.\nTARDIS: The mind creature will be explained in more depth early in Part Four, when the Doctor and Erimem are on the chariot. There’s already a small scene where the Doctor briefly gocs over what the creature is. He'll now go into detail, explaining that the creature exists totally in the minds of biological hosts. No matter how many people (or creatures) are infected, it remains a single creature, spreading out and looking for new hosts. It isn’t particularly vicious - evolution has just left it with this as its way of propagating and surviving. If needs be, to protect itself, the creature can abandon minds. (But should this be mentioned? it's a great big sign-post of things to come. Personally I'd rather not use it - or at least make sure it’s a throwaway and not banded much significance in the speech.)\nTARDIS: The ending is the big problem. You hate it. Which is a pretty major problem really. You were clear that it’s the violence in it you didn’t like.Too much solving of problems just by somebody getting a thumping. Okay. Reading through it, I had a few problems with it myself - the Doctor wouldn't look to bury someone alive as easily as he did here. He'd try something smarter than that. So here's an alternative ending:\nTARDIS: ‘The storyline goes along the same path until the Doctor and Peri head down into the tunnel under the Sphinx. Up top, the battle is being lost by the Egyptian troops.They are being converted in mass numbers. Erimem is grabbed and dragged down, after Antranak’s chariot crashes. The Doctor and Peri have reached the end of the tunnel, which he opens only to save Erimem’s life. He plays the scene as if he’s only just discovered that Peri is infected. If he let on that he knew days eartier, they'd know he\nTARDIS: 295\nTARDIS: was up to something. Erimem will be killed (or infected) if he resists Horemshep passing the creature on to him. He agrees, but the fragment of the creature present in Horemshep can’t get a grasp on his mind - it’s too big. It’s the Doctor's plan - he's crying to pull all the different strands of the creature into one place so that he only has one enemy to deal with. To do that he has to let the thing get an idea of how much effort it would take to capture a Time Lord's mind. When the creature comes together in one body - Peri’s - the Doctor's plan is starting to go a bit pear-shaped. He'd expected it to be Horus or Yanis, where it has a stronger hold. But the creature knows the Doctor won't kill his friend - or anybody else if he can help it. He has to act quickly - the human brain can't deal with the sort of mental energy Peri's having to process. His plan was to lure the mind creature here and then use the telepathic inhibitor to disorient the host. Unfortunately, the inhibitor can’t handie the sheer volume of mental energy present in Peri and burns itself out. The Doctor knows he has to get the creature in Peri talking before it can take his mind. He asks it questions - lots of questions. He gets Erimem to do the same. Everyone present throws questions at the Peri host. The strain of trying to process so many questions throws the creature into distress. At first Peri can answer the questions, throwing the answers back with arrogance and disdain, but as the questions come quicker, she is in pain and the creature finds itself struggling with the limitations of the human brain. It has the memories of so many people that it can't help knowing the answers - but the human brain can’t deal with all that information at once and Peri's brain shuts down after a barrage of questions. And so everything's sorted - until a rat scuttles over and sniffs at Peri. A fragment of the creature is passed to the rat. The Doctor plonks a (canopic?) jar over the rat, trapping it.The Doctor has to get Peri and the rat to the TARDIS quickly - he can draw the mind parasite from them and store it safely until he can deliver it to the appropriate authorities. The creature makes a final bid for freedom - trying to take control of the TARDIS through the telepathic circuits, but screams in pain when it realises how vast the ship's mind (for want of a better word) is. It’s out of its depth. The Doctor comments that the TARDIS will Jock it away safely in a corner of her memory until it’s ready to go to the authorities. (Is this TARDIS scene overkill? A cop-out? It's just that, given the Doctor's hatred for taking any life, he'd probably try to keep the creature safe, no matter what instinct had made it do. But I’m not sure if the scene in the TARDIS would be necessary. Maybe it would, just to show Peri recovering and letting Erimem see a glimpse of the reality behind the Doctor's stories. Or perhaps the Doctor could comment on the creature trying to take the ship, knowing that it doesn't have a hope? He's not even slightly worried.)\nTARDIS: From herc, Peri recovers and gets to see the celebrations. Erimem knows she can't be Pharaoh and decides to slip away. Peri suggests that she leave in the TARDIS - there’s nowhere on Earth in that period that won't know who Erimem is. The Doctor takes some persuading and Icts Erunem know she probably won't have the chance to come back and that wherever or whenever she settles it won't be like anything she’s ever known. He tells her of the risks and the downside of such a drastic move, but she wants to go, to learn, and so they go, leaving a badly hurt (broken leg? Arm?) Antranak and Fayum to walk in on the dematerialising TARDIS. Confirmation that Erimem was indeed a god. He doesn’t know it yet, but Fayum’s going to be Pharaoh. By the way. Yanis is dealt with by Fayum (it's kind of redemption for him after the parasite abandons his mind). He takes up a sword and deals with Yanis (quickly - I guess a swordfight would be dull on audio). Maybe it’s not a swordfight at all? Maybe Fayum just cuts a rope or uses the\nTARDIS: 296\nTARDIS: sword to set off one of the traps in the tunnel/tomb, or uses it to topple a statue on top of Yanis. However he does it. Fayum should deal with Yanis (who'll be in a foul temper. knowing that his chances of taking Egypt are gone and because he realises that the creature has been manipulating him). The quiet priest defeats the warlord and shows himself worthy of being Pharaoh.\nTARDIS: This ending’s pretty much violence-free (except for the Fayum/Yanis bit, which won't be actual fisticuffs or anything like that) and I think it's more of a Doctor Who ending. The Doctor's thinking his way out rather than fighting. He doesn’t relish the thought of one human brain having to deal with what it'll have to go through (particularly when he finds out it’s Peri's) but the creature needs to be in one host to be defeated.\nTARDIS: From your notes, I wasn't sure if you liked the setting for the ending or not. It needed to be somewhere isolated but close to the action, and the sink-shaft in the story really does exist, as does the tunnel at the bottom of it. According to myths recounted in various Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval type books. the tunnel leads to a giant chamber between the front paws of the Sphinx, and also branches off into the pyramids. Whether it does or not. I've no idea, but ] thought it was worth using the myth. It felt like the right sort of place for a Doctor Who finale. and made sense from the Doctor's perspective in the story. But. if you don’t like it. we could shift to a temple or even a necropolis. It’s just that almost everybody already know the pyramids and the Sphinx, so we don't have to take too much time setting up the location for the ending.\nTARDIS: Obviously, the ending’s still in pretty rough form here. but it’s probably best to let you have a shufti now. rather than plough on and find youre after something totally different.\nTARDIS: The points you raised in no particular order.\nTARDIS: It wouldn't be common for women of this era to read but it wouldn't be unheard of either. A lot would depend on where the women came from. Some of the tribes of the time would make sure their noble-women could read to make them more appealing to whoever they were going to wind up getting married off to. The nature of the Pharaoh involved comes into it a lot as well. If Pharach wanted to keep his women uneducated, well. that was that really. No reading. no learning, no chatting about anything interesting - just lie back and think of Egypt whenever old Pharaoh got the horn and decided it was number 47's turn. Given that Erimem can read and fight, I think we can assume that her dad was a pretty reasonable Pharaoh, who didn't have a problem with women leaning and probably encouraged it.\nTARDIS: The world being round was first proven by an Egyptian smart-arse by the name of Eratosthenes. He was an astronomer. historian. geographer. philosopher. theatre critic. poet and mathematician. A right bloody clever clogs. Anyway. he worked out that the world was round by using big sticks. the movement of the sun during the day and the difference in time of sunset on the same days in different locations. He worked out the Earth's diameter and circumference to within a few percent of the exact figure. He was a good bit later than Erimem’s era but he did work from other people's suggestions and ideas going back to Erimem’s time and before. so it’s feasible that the idea was being bounced about at the time by a local brainbox.\nTARDIS: 27\nTARDIS: Pronunciations. Okay, here gocs. Erimemushinteperem Erimem-oosh-in-tep-er-em\nTARDIS: Kohl pronounced like ‘Coal’\nTARDIS: Hatchepsut as it's written Hat-chep-soot\nTARDIS: Smenkhare Smen-carry\nTARDIS: Heset hes-set\nTARDIS: Maab Mab\nTARDIS: Maat Mat\nTARDIS: Seth as Emmerdale as it sounds - became Set at some point in history but I used Seth to avoid Pyramids of Mars ideas.\nTARDIS: Rhaoubak Roo-back\nTARDIS: Priest's speech As it’s written I suppose. It's not a real prayer. I made it up. Tt was just something to sound authentic before the priest got a doing.\nTARDIS: Cheops Key-ops\nTARDIS: names As they're written. f made them up and they're not used\nTARDIS: again anywhere.\nTARDIS: By the way CWARNING - high boredom factor ahead), stating that Smenkhare was female is taking sides in a contentious debate amongst Egyptian scholars. Traditionalists go with the idea that Smenkhare was a noble who succeeded Atenakhen and that’s that, so there and yah-boo-sucks. A more modern idea is that Smenkhare is actually Atenakhen’s wife, Nefertiti. At first her name was just Nerfertiti, then she changed it to Nefer-Nefer-Nuahu-Nefertiti (fit that on a cheque). She disappeared totally from history at the exact time that the co-ruler, joint Pharaoh (and lover if we go by the smutty carvings) of Atenakhen appeared. This co-ruler was Smenkhare-Nefer-Nefer-Nuahu. So, one side says it’s the same person. The other side shouts ‘bollocks’ and the intellectual debate contuinues. It’s not really a big thing - but I reckoned that Doctor Who would always come down backing the controversial side of an argument like this one.\nTARDIS: 298"
