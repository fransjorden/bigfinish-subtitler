      "searchable_dialogue": "RAPPEL: Oh, damn it, Tarrant. I'm getting water right down my neck. Doesn't this weather ever let up?\nBEV: Rain does tend to be the primary feature of a rain forest. I did warn you.\nRAPPEL: Oh yeah, right. Like you warned us that this was a twelve day flight from any of the major space-lanes. Like you warned us that this planet crawling with bugs. Ow!\nBEV: Shut up, Rappel. You're starting to irritate me.\nBEV: Were here.\nRAPPEL: That's it? A two hour hike from the ship for that?\nBEV: Do you think we would be here if it wasn't worth it? Two one four, Tika, over here.\nBEV: Right. This is the Kar-Charrat ziggurat. Now, from this point, you're going to do things my way. I've paid good money for you to behave like a professional salvage crew, not a load of sweaty, whinging oiks. No communication without my authority, no firing unless provoked, and no climbing on the artefacts to see how good the view might be from the top. Tika, set up perimeter alarms. Two one four, compositional analysis, full scan.\nBEV: 214: Confirmed.\nBEV: Right, let's take a look at this thing.\nRAPPEL: Er.\nBEV: What the hell is wrong with you, Rappel? Annoyed that I gave Tika first watch?\nRAPPEL: No. It's this ziggurat thing. I, I\nBEV: What? Come on, Rappel. You know me too well to clam up on me.\nRAPPEL: No, it's just. Nothing. This thing, I've got a funny feeling. Is it really worth everything you say it is?\nBEV: Yeah, I think so. Have you ever seen anything like it?\nRAPPEL: No. Wait a minute. It feels strange. It's not like stone at all. Why aren't there any plants growing on it?\nBEV: How the hell should I know? Maybe it doesn't want any plants growing on it.\nRAPPEL: [OC]: And is it as old as they say it is?\nBEV: [OC]: Accurately dated at one thousand two hundred and seventy years.\nRAPPEL: [OC]: Hmm.\nBEV: [OC]: What is wrong, Rappel?\nRAPPEL: [OC]: I don't like it, Tarrant. Something's not right.\nBEV: [OC]: Rappel, you'll be saying you've heard Kar-Charrat phantoms next. Just think of your fee. Now come on. Give me a hand assembling the sled.\nRAPPEL: [OC]: Mmm, okay.\nACE: Professor! Who's been messing around with your bookshelves?\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nACE: Halfway through Dickens there's this bloke called Dieter of Rathgar, then Remek of Rathgar, then a book on Trees of Rathgar, and suddenly we're into the horticulture section.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, I don't get much time to sort the Tardis library out. Every fifty years or so I start, but I always forget how I'm organising things. Sometimes it's by author, sometime by planet. I thought I'd try stacking them by colour. Yes, that might prove more effective. Ooo, what a good idea.\nACE: So what should I do with Bleak House?\nDOCTOR: Oh, put it in the architecture section. Yes. (hums.)\nACE: Hey, these look well old. Oh! (coughs) Urgh, you could use a duster, Professor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the grime of centuries does tend to build up in here.\nACE: Hey, your fine on these is going to have built up as well. Mind you, I suppose the advantage of a time machine is that you don't have to be late with your library books.\nDOCTOR: Library books? Let me see them. Oh no!\nACE: Oh, don't sweat it, Professor. Everyone's nicked a couple of library books at some point.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but these three books are from the Library of Kar-Charrat.\nACE: So?\nDOCTOR: Ace, the Library on Kar-Charrat holds every scrap of information from every civilised world. One of everything. And if I've got these,\nACE: Then they've got some holes in their collection. Still, I can't see that anyone's going to miss three volumes on Juggling for Alpha Centurians.\nDOCTOR: Ace, that is not the point. Kar-Charrat rivals the Matrix on Gallifrey for its sheer quantity of information. All knowledge is useful to someone. I always prefer Kar-Charrat to the Matrix. There's a lot to be said for good, old-fashioned books. Come on!\nACE: Hey, hold on. Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Kar-Charrat.\nACE: What, now?\nDOCTOR: I haven't been there since the Time Lords were helping with the defence grid. These books are long overdue.\nACE: Oh, I was only kidding about the fine.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I doubt the librarians will be joking. They take their duties very seriously.\nACE: How come this Library is so important, Professor?\nDOCTOR: This isn't your local Council library, Ace. I mean, think of it. Every book, every piece of literature from every civilised world. Kar-Charrat is one of the wonders of the Universe, and its existence is hidden from almost everyone.\nACE: I don't get it. Why build a library and then hide it?\nDOCTOR: Because the accumulation of knowledge held within its walls makes it a very dangerous weapon, if it's in the wrong hands.\nACE: If you can read all the books.\nDOCTOR: There are quicker ways of assimilating data than reading.\nDOCTOR: Ah ha! We're landing. Ah, now, let's see what it's like out there.\nACE: Oh, brilliant. It's chucking it down, Professor.\nDOCTOR: Well, it's a good thing I've got my umbrella, then, isn't it? Come along, Ace.\nDOCTOR: Oh, stop moaning and stand under the umbrella.\nACE: Great waterfall, Professor, but this doesn't look much like a library.\nDOCTOR: As I said, they've never exactly advertised their presence. Kar-Charrat is way off the normal space-lanes. A regular backwater. Very close to the edge of the galaxy, in fact.\nACE: Which galaxy?\nDOCTOR: This one.\nACE: So where is the Library?\nDOCTOR: At the top of the waterfall.\nACE: Oh, brilliant.\nDOCTOR: Come on.\nDALEK: Sensors detecting alien sound waves. Sound profile analysing. Matching to data files.\nDALEK: Profiling confirmed. Activation sequencer engaged.\nBEV: How's it coming over there, 214?\nBEV: 214: Analysis unconfirmed. Scanners ineffective.\nBEV: What, nothing?\nRAPPEL: Huh. I knew this was a waste of time.\nBEV: Shut it, Rappel. 214, switch to secondary scanners.\nBEV: 214: Switching to secondary frequency. Scanning.\nRAPPEL: What do you expect to find, Tarrant?\nBEV: Something a damn sight more interesting than you whining.\nRAPPEL: Now listen. I've\nRAPPEL: 214: Attention. Energy signature detected. Power fluctuations. Disengaging.\nBEV: What the? Oh, my God!\nRAPPEL: It's opening. The damn thing's opening.\nBEV: Tika! Get down here now! 214, get back!\nRAPPEL: What the hell is that?\nRAPPEL: 214: Switching to armament circuits. Powering weapons.\nBEV: 214, no!\nBEV: 214!\nBEV: 214: Malfunction.\nRAPPEL: Damn you. Bev, get back! Whatever you are, stop or I fire.\nBEV: Rappel, it's not stopping it. Come on, Rappel!\nRAPPEL: Get Tika. Get the plasma laser.\nBEV: But\nRAPPEL: Do it!\nBEV: Tika, Rappel wants the plasma cannon. Move it!\nBEV: Rappel, get out of there!\nRAPPEL: I think I'm holding it. I argh!\nBEV: Rappel! Tika, the plasma cannon. Tika, Rappel and 214 are dead. That thing. For God's sake, stop that thing!\nBEV: It's not stopping it. Tika, look out!\nDALEK: Alien aggressors eliminated. Scan for primary target. Source located. Trackers locked. Phase one completed. Initiating phase two.\nACE: Professor, this is crazy. There's nothing here but ruins. Wet ruins.\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Ace. I'm concentrating.\nACE: So am I. On a nice warm Tardis, on the shower I was going to have, on dinner.\nDOCTOR: Ace!\nACE: All right, all right. If you want to poke around some old ruins in the pouring rain, go ahead. I'll just have a nose round, see if there's anything of interest. Like a decent pub. Why can't we ever land on nice planets? What was that, Professor? Oh, now where's he gone to? Hello? Who is that? Who's there? Look, this isn't funny. Who is that? Professor? Doctor? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Ace! What is it, Ace? What's wrong?\nACE: Where are you? I can't see you.\nDOCTOR: Here, Ace, what's the matter? You look as though you've seen a ghost.\nACE: You just appeared out of thin air.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I did, didn't I. Come on. Give me your hand.\nACE: But how, how did you. Oh, wow!\nDOCTOR: Welcome to Kar-Charrat library.\nACE: Professor, we're in exactly the same place. It's the same mountainside.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that's right.\nACE: But nothing's ruined here.\nDOCTOR: No.\nACE: It's beautiful.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Very elegant architects, these Kar-Charratans. Come along. We'll go to the main reception desk. Why were you calling me? Was there something wrong?\nACE: Oh, I thought I heard something.\nDOCTOR: Really? What sort of thing?\nACE: I'm not sure. Something in the rain. I just got spooked. And, Professor, your vanishing act didn't help. How did you do that? How is all this hidden?\nDOCTOR: An. A little bit of temporal trickery, courtesy of the Time Lords. A time bubble. The library's hidden behind a temporal projection of how it will look in three and a half thousand years. No one knows it's here because everyone thinks it vanished centuries ago. Typically convoluted Time Lord way of doing things.\nACE: Yeah, they do tend to do things the hard way. I've noticed that.\nDOCTOR: The projection is impenetrable without the correct key, unless you're a Time-sensitive.\nACE: Which you are, of course.\nDOCTOR: Oh, of course.\nACE: Shame the Time Lords couldn't do anything about the weather.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure it's very good for the plants. Come along, Ace. Almost there.\nDALEK: Contact lost. Holding position. Scanning. Battle readiness to be maintained. Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.\nACE: Wow! You could fit Saint Paul's in here.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but never an umbrella stand when you want one.\nELGIN: Doctor! Dear Doctor. How nice to see you again.\nDOCTOR: Chief Librarian Elgin, what a pleasant surprise. Oh, this is my young friend, Ace.\nACE: Hi.\nELGIN: Er, hi.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, Ace is from twentieth century Earth.\nELGIN: Charmed. Charmed. The Doctor always travels with such delightful companions. I, however, am stuck with the constantly glowering visage of Cataloguer Prink, here. Come along, Prink. Say hello to our guests. And do try and raise a smile.\nDOCTOR: Good afternoon, Cataloguer Prink. I'm the Doctor and this is Ace.\nELGIN: Oh, come now. We can't stand chatting in reception. Tell me, Doctor. What brings you back to Kar-Charrat? It's been several years. Back when the temporal grid was being erected, I believe. (receding) I seem to recall you being somewhat taller.\nELGIN: (approaching) The library has had some remarkable additions since we last met, Doctor. I do so hope you have time to look around properly. Not that I wish to detain you. I realise how full your life is.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, that's very kind of you, Mister Elgin. I would love to look around.\nELGIN: Oh, how wonderful.\nDOCTOR: But\nELGIN: It's so rare that we are visited by any one of your intellect. In fact, it is rare that we are visited at all.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the library does seem somewhat empty.\nACE: Well, not everyone is a Time-sensitive, are they?\nDOCTOR: Ace.\nELGIN: Oh, the staff are all on the upper levels, dealing with our agents for new data, or dallying their lives away in the recreation lounge. Prink and I spend so long alone down here amongst the books these days, don't we, Prink?\nELGIN: Yes, well, we've tightened up security so much that all research is done via hypercable these days. I can't recall I took a shuttle to the frontier to browse in a newsagent. I really should employ you, Doctor, to collect books for me. Or you, my dear. Ah, the wonders of twentieth century Earth. Such classics in newsprint. The Sun, The Mirror. (sighs) Now then, Doctor, what brings you back here to Kar-Charrat? A social call?\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, it seems that I may have accidentally taken some of your books, possibly for somewhat longer than I expected.\nACE: And he's a bit worried about the fine, aren't you, Professor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Ace.\nELGIN: Books? Missing from the main library? This is unheard of. This is disastrous. Show me at once.\nDOCTOR: It must have been when I was last here. Only some light reading. A few reference books.\nACE: Heaw reading. Why you couldn't have nicked a couple of paperbacks?\nELGIN: Oh! My word. Volumes from the Alpha Centuri collection. Doctor, you have no idea how much trouble you could have caused. Fortunately, no one has been asking after them. I am astounded that our cataloguing department has not missed them sooner, eh, Mister Prink? What do you have to say for yourself?\nDOCTOR: I really didn't mean to cause Mister Prink any trouble.\nELGIN: No, no matter. Return the books to their rightful place, Prink. I will show our visitors around. Well? Go on, Prink. Hurry along.\nELGIN: Oh dear. He is an excellent cataloguer, but it's so difficult to keep his mind on his work. Far too chatty.\nBEV: Tika? Tika? Oh God. Oh please no. Not you too. Oh, Rappel, I'm sorry. I really thought I'd found a way of making us rich, and and all I've done is found a way of getting you killed. And if I'm not careful I could be joining you. (beeps) 214? Oh, my God. I thought you were. 214, are you still functional?\nBEV: 214: Operating on emergency reserves. Estimate limited operational time remaining.\nBEV: Can you contact the ship? Operate by remote?\nBEV: 214: Negative. Power too low.\nBEV: Distress beacon?\nBEV: 214: Not enough power to break through troposphere. Apologies.\nBEV: Don't worry. 2. I'll try to reach the ship. Ow!\nBEV: 214: Sensors indicate extensive tissue damage to your right leg. Suggest that you seek immediate assistance.\nBEV: Thanks, 214. I'd never have thought of that. Oh, if you've got any energy left, can you open your medical pouch?\nBEV: 214: Goodbye, Beverley.\nBEV: Goodbye, 2. Stimulants, vibropants. Oh, painkillers. Come on, Bev. Two miles of jungle on your hands and knees? Just what you need.\nELGIN: And so, Doctor, as you can see, the anti-grav systems have made access to upper levels far easier for a variety of different lifeforms.\nDOCTOR: Yes, most ingenious.\nACE: What lifeforms, though? We haven't seen a single person using the library.\nELGIN: Using it? My dear young girl, you make it sound like some kind of tool.\nACE: But isn't that exactly what it should be?\nELGIN: This facility is a masterpiece, one of the wonders of the known universe.\nACE: But surely the whole point of having all these books is that people can read them.\nELGIN: Read them? But that could mean damage, grubby fingermarks, pages folded down. My spine shivers at the damage that could be done if we let the public in here. We simply don't make enough of a profit to keep a restoration team.\nACE: And if more people knew it was here and could use it, maybe you would make more of a profit.\nDOCTOR: Now, Ace.\nACE: Oh come on, Professor. You're not siding with him, surely?\nDOCTOR: Well, the library is rather special.\nELGIN: Perhaps if I showed you our new facility.\nACE: No, thank you. I think I've seen enough untouchable books for the moment. I'm going back to the Tardis, Professor, to get a book I can read.\nDOCTOR: But you won't be able to get in past the temporal barrier.\nELGIN: Oh, we have arrangements for people coming and going, Doctor. Here, my dear.\nACE: Oi!\nELGIN: A DNA tag that will get you in past the barriers. Sends a confirmation signal to the main computer. Most ingenious. Our technical boffins are always coming up with new ways of keeping us safe. Don't lose it, though. You won't get in without it.\nACE: Thanks. (recedes) Patronising git.\nDOCTOR: Ace, wait a moment.\nDOCTOR: Chief Librarian Elgin may be a little pompous, but he does mean well. I'll come and find you later. I believe that there's a very good reading room on the second floor. Barely used.\nACE: Okay, Professor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, here. Take my umbrella. In case you haven't noticed, it's raining out.\nELGIN: Come along, Doctor. There's still plenty more to see.\nDOCTOR: Coming, Mister Elgin.\nPHANTOM: (whispers echoing) Poor dead things. Poor dead things. Poor Rappel. Poor Rappel. Your body is nothing to you now. Your body is nothing to you now. No use. No use. But to us it is life. But to us it is life. You can help us. You can help us. Help all. We can help all.\nACE: Oh, marvellous. A fit of adolescent pique and you end up in the pouring rain again. Still, at least there are no whispering ghosts this time. Why the hell did they build a library on this dump? It's no wonder they never get any visitors.\nDALEK: Target reacquired. Motive units to full power. Weaponry armed.\nELGIN: Here, Doctor. Here is the greatest achievement of Kar-Charrat.\nDOCTOR: Water tanks? Don't tell me you've decided to start a trout farm.\nELGIN: Really, Doctor. Try and show a little respect.\nELGIN: Ah, Prink. Glad you could finally join us. Now then, Doctor. This is our latest data store. Contained in these tanks is every scrap of knowledge in the library. And room for more. It's a system called\nDOCTOR: Aqueous data storage. Commonly known as a wet works facility.\nELGIN: Oh. You've encountered them. I was rather hoping that we had come up with something you didn't have knowledge of. How tedious.\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid that I do tend to get about a bit. But the size of this facility. I've never seen anything on this scale, Elgin. Most wet works chambers can only manage a few gigabytes of information, but this must house\nELGIN: The entire knowledge of the universe.\nBEV: Oh, damn it. Where the hell am I now? Hey. Hey, over here. Help!\nACE: Hang on.\nBEV: Oh, thank God. I didn't think I'd find anyone else on this God-forsaken planet.\nACE: It's okay. Here, let me help.\nBEV: Thanks.\nACE: Over here, under this overhang.\nBEV: Oh, right.\nACE: Well, you're no ghost.\nBEV: Sorry?\nACE: Oh, nothing. Talking to myself. I'm Ace.\nBEV: Tarrant. Bev Tarrant. What the hell brings you to Kar-Charrat? Ow!\nACE: Hey, you're really badly hurt, aren't you.\nBEV: Damn right I am. Bloody thing shot me in the leg.\nACE: What thing?\nBEV: Oh, I don't know what the hell it was, but it came at us without warning, opened fire before we'd even had the chance to try and communicate.\nACE: Us?\nBEV: My crew. Four of us. The others (pause) The others are all dead.\nACE: I'm sorry.\nBEV: Yeah. Yes, so am Il.\nACE: This thing that attacked you, is it still out here?\nBEV: Somewhere. I'm not sure how long I was unconscious. It went off into the jungle somewhere.\nACE: Then maybe we'd better get back indoors.\nBEV: On Kar-Charrat? There is no indoors. The planet's just one big soggy pool. This is about as dry as it gets.\nACE: There's the library.\nBEV: Library? On this rock? You've been out in the rain too long, girl.\nACE: Now just you listen to me, Tarrant. There's a concealed building up the mountain. The owners don't exactly go out of their way to publicise it.\nBEV: But there's nothing here.\nACE: Well, they're obviously doing a good job then, aren't they? Now, do you want to get somewhere dry with air conditioning or not?\nBEV: I've got no better options.\nACE: Hey, what was that?\nBEV: Freeler birds. Noisy when disturbed.\nACE: No prizes for guessing what disturbed them then.\nBEV: Something large and aggressive, with a tendency to shoot first.\nACE: Right.\nBEV: Where did you say this library was?\nELGIN: Speechless, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Impressed. I'd no idea that you had such technical expertise. Even the Time Lords failed to develop a wet works facility like this. That's why the Matrix was created, and even we don't claim to have all the knowledge of the entire universe.\nELGIN: Well, it's nice to see that we are good at some things. Would you like to see more?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I would.\nDOCTOR: How did you solve the problem of differentiation of data currents, or retaining droplet coherence?\nELGIN: Oh, please, Doctor. No boring technical questions. I am an academic. I'm not interested in the workings of the thing. I employ people to deal with that. I'll get Prink to introduce you to our resident technical boffins later, if you so wish.\nDOCTOR: But you must know how the data can be downloaded.\nELGIN: Yes, well, I had to get them to make the user interface simple. You know that I'm useless with machines. Here.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nELGIN: As you can see, the reader sits in the chair and puts on the headset.\nDOCTOR: Programming the relevant data from the control panel on the armrest, no doubt.\nELGIN: Yes, quite. Data retrieval is almost instantaneous.\nDOCTOR: Astonishing. You could acquire the wisdom of a million years from a billion worlds in less time than it would take to read a bus ticket.\nELGIN: Yes. Elegantly put, Doctor. Elegantly put. We've had representatives from a dozen difference races enquiring about it. Some of them got quite aggressive.\nDOCTOR: Really? What races?\nACE: Come on, we're almost there.\nBEV: I only hope you're not deluding yourself about this library, you know. I'd hate to cripple myself climbing this damn mountain for nothing.\nACE: And I sincerely hope that whatever that thing in the jungle is, it doesn't like heights. Now come on.\nELGIN: I really don't see why you're making such a fuss, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Making a fuss? What you have here has the potential to become the greatest weapon ever created. Knowledge is dangerous when abused. This much knowledge could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.\nELGIN: But that's why the Time Lords helped us with our defences. The temporal field is impenetrable.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I hope you're right. What I want to know is how anyone got to hear of this. Are your data collectors trustworthy?\nELGIN: Oh, really, Doctor. Don't be so melodramatic. They're all academics. Quiet types. This is a research facility, not a weapon.\nDOCTOR: You'd be surprised, Mister Elgin, just how far some people will go to gain access to the Kar-Charrat Library. You've something very precious here. Remember that.\nELGIN: There was only one race that really had the security boys worried.\nDOCTOR: What race, Elgin?\nELGIN: Oh, you know how bad I am with names. I really don't think that er\nDOCTOR: What race.\nELGIN: Er, robotic things. Nasty little pepperpots. I think they were called\nDOCTOR: Daleks.\nDALEK: Target located. Initiate phase two.\nBEV: I knew it. You are mad. There's nothing here, Ace. No Library.\nACE: Trust me.\nBEV: Trust you? You drag me halfway up a mountain with a broken leg in the pouring rain, while my ship is safely hidden down there in the jungle.\nACE: Shh.\nBEV: What?\nACE: Quiet. Listen.\nBEV: Youre really starting to piss me off.\nACE: Bev\nBEV: Oh, my God.\nACE: Oh, no. Oh, it's seen us.\nDALEK: Do not move. You are my prisoners. Do not move or you will be exterminated.\nDALEK: All units prepare for battle conditions. Phase one of our plan is now complete. The companion of the Doctor is now a prisoner of the Daleks."

If the Daleks get their nasty little suckers on this wet work store\nELGIN: But they won't. The defence structure is quite formidable. You yourself said that only the Time Lords and a handful of Time sensitives could get in without the correct key, Oh, those tiresome creatures tried to gain access of course\nDOCTOR: Tried? You mean they actually landed here on Kar-Charrat?\nELGIN: Er, yes. A small squad. They intercepted a hypercable transmission, made all sorts of threats.\nDOCTOR: Then?\nELGIN: Well, they tried to attack, of course.\nDOCTOR: Yes, they would.\nELGIN: They tried blasting their way through the temporal field, but soon gave up.\nDOCTOR: Gave up?

The time field generators always attract so much dust, and er, with my chest the way it is.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure that Mister Prink can show me the way.\nELGIN: Oh, what an excellent suggestion. Prink always likes tinkering with machines, don't you, Prink?\nELGIN: Yes, you see? He can barely contain his enthusiasm.\nDOCTOR: Splendid.\nELGIN: Well, off you go then. Don't keep the man waiting, Prink.\nTANNOY: Would Cataloguer Prink please report to main reception. Cataloguer Prink to reception please.\nELGIN: Oh, typical. Just when there's work that needs doing.

Computer, access to temporal defences, please.\nCOMPUTER: Thank you, Librarian Elgin. Defence grid control opening.\nELGIN: As you can see, Doctor, everything is in order.\nDOCTOR: Yes, hmm.\nELGIN: Is this going to take long? I really would like to demonstrate the wet works facility.\nDOCTOR: Were there any problems after the Dalek attack?\nELGIN: Oh, none at all. Perhaps attack was the wrong word. It was almost like\nDOCTOR: A test?\nELGIN: Yes, exactly. As if they were testing themselves, just to check that they really couldn't get in.\nDOCTOR: Interesting.\nELGIN: Whatever is the matter, Doctor? You look quite concerned.\nDOCTOR: I shouldn't have let Ace go out there alone.\nELGIN: Oh now, come along, Doctor. You are being needlessly melodramatic. Why, even Prink never gets as excitable as you are getting. It has been years since the Daleks were here. Surely you don't think that they would stil/ be out there, lurking in the undergrowth?\nDOCTOR: Mister Elgin, the Daleks are devious, ruthless, and it is more than likely that they are lurking in the undergrowth.\nELGIN: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Come along, Mister Elgin. I want to take some readings and see if I can find Ace.\nELGIN: Oh, very well, very well. If it will ease your anxieties. Oh, do slow down Doctor. I'm not nearly as fit as I once was.\nELGIN: Oh, oh, do we have to go tearing off in quite such an undignified manner, Doctor? It's raining and the damp is so bad for my chest. If we wait a few hours\nDOCTOR: A few hours may be too late, if the Daleks are here on Kar-Charrat.\nELGIN: Oh, but my dear Doctor, I've explained already. It was years ago. Oh, my word!\nDOCTOR: Ace?\nELGIN: Oh dear. Is the poor thing hurt?\nDOCTOR: Ace, are you all right?\nELGIN: Oh, thank goodness.\nDOCTOR: Ace, what happened?\nACE: Oh, ow.\nDOCTOR: Ace, was it Daleks?\nACE: Doctor.\nELGIN: What about your other companion?\nDOCTOR: Other companion?\nELGIN: Yes, the young lady over here.\nDOCTOR: Just sit here for a moment, Ace.\nELGIN: Oh dear, this one seems quite badly hurt.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and very unconscious. Do you have a medical facility in the Library?\nELGIN: Well, yes, but\nDOCTOR: Then hurry along, Mister Elgin. We need some form of stretcher.\nELGIN: Is this lady a friend of yours, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Never seen her before in my life.\nACE: Oh, ow. Bev?\nDALEK: Do not move from holding area.\nACE: A Dalek. Of course. A weird looking one, though. Some kind of special weapons model, are you?\nDALEK: You are in our power.\nACE: Where's Beverley? What have you done with her?\nDALEK: The other humanoid is of no importance.\nACE: She's important to me. Ow! Argh!\nDALEK: Prolonged exposure to restraint field will cause considerable tissue damage. You will refrain from unnecessary movement.\nACE: Ah, yeah, right. Ah, oh. What are you planning to do with me?\nDALEK: You are to be teleported to the mother ship for interrogation by the Dalek Supreme. Scout seven to Dalek Command. Teleportation in seven rels.\nACE: Sooner or later someone's going to notice that I'm missing.\nDALEK: We have anticipated that possibility.\nACE: What do you mean? What have you done?\nDALEK: The Dalek stratagem for your capture has included your duplication.\nACE: No!\nDALEK: Your DNA profile has been inserted into the make-up of the duplicate.\nACE: You won't get past the Library defences. You can't!\nDALEK: The DNA device you possess is now in the hands of your duplicate. The defence computer will allow access. She will penetrate the Kar-Charrat facility. Dalek victory is assured.\nACE: No!\nDALEK: [OC]: Teleportation coordinates locked on. Prepare for transference.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR: There, she's stable, whoever she may be.\nELGIN: Will she be all right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. A few hours sleep and she'll be as right as rain. Now then, Ace. Where did you find your new friend?\nACE: 2: She was outside, in the jungle. I don't know who she is.\nELGIN: It's most unusual for us to have visitors.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Did she say anything about where she came from? Why she's here?\nACE: 2: No.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right, Ace?\nACE: 2: Oh, I'm fine.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we ought to get the medical computer to give you a quick check-up.\nACE: 2: Honestly, Doctor, I'm all right. Don't fuss.\nDOCTOR: All right. What happened out there, Ace? What attacked you?\nACE: 2: I, I'm not sure. Some animal. Something from the forest.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nACE: 2: Of course I'm sure.\nDOCTOR: An animal? Not a Dalek?\nACE: 2: No.\nDOCTOR: Look, Ace, I think you should rest here, just for a while. I'll look in on you later. Come on, Elgin. I still want to have a look outside.\nELGIN: Oh, if we really must. (coughs)\nDALEK: [OC]: Locate main temporal barrier controls. Disable,\nACE: 2: I obey.\nELGIN: I do hope that your young companion will be all right, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so do I. She may be in shock. There's something that she isn't telling us, certainly, and it's going to be several hours before our mysterious visitor regains consciousness. Elgin, what reason would that young woman have for being on this planet, given that the Library is kept secret from practically the entire universe? Why should she come here?\nELGIN: I'm not sure, Doctor. We do get some students out here, studying the ruins. Oh, and the ziggurat, of course.\nDOCTOR: The ziggurat? You mean they've got pyramids on this planet?\nELGIN: Just the one. Quite an impressive specimen, out in the jungles. Some remnant of an ancient civilisation. Generated quite a bit of interest when we were building the place.\nDOCTOR: Do you know how to get there?\nELGIN: Of course. It was quite a hobby of mine in my younger days.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Then you can tell me all about it on the way.\nELGIN: Oh.\nDALEK: Phase one is now complete. The Doctor's companion is now aboard.\nDALEK: 2: Is she to be exterminated?\nDALEK: No. Her brain patterns may be necessary for the duplicate to remain undetected. Capture of Kar-Charrat facility is of primary importance.\nDALEK: 3: Dalek assault teams are assembled.\nDALEK: All battle commanders must ensure that the storage facility remains undamaged. Test subjects will be linked to the data store as soon as we achieve control. The Daleks will achieve total knowledge.\nDALEK: 2: Are humanoids within facility to be retained for questioning?\nDALEK: No. The humanoids refuse to cooperate with Dalek Command. They assume that they are safe within their temporal barriers. They will be exterminated.\nDALEK: 2: Halt.\nDALEK: 4: Scout seven reporting to Dalek Supreme with human prisoner.\nDALEK: 2: Proceed.\nDALEK: 4: Move.\nACE: Oi, stop pushing.\nDALEK: Human will remain silent. Report.\nDALEK: 4: Phase one of infiltration stratagem initiated. Duplicate now within Kar-Charrat facility. Dalek control of wet works data storage area predicted within three hundred rels.\nDALEK: Satisfactory. You will report to area two nine and prepare a computer sphere advising all Dalek units on surface conditions. Await orders for ground assault.\nDALEK: 4: I obey.\nACE: You won't fool him, you know. The Doctor knows me too well. He'll see through any copy.\nDALEK: The Doctor may be suspicious, but your duplicate will only need a short time to deactivate the defence screens. By the time the Doctor is aware of our plan, it will be too late.\nACE: Ha! You're guessing, Dalek. It's pure fluke that me and the Doctor are here at all.\nDALEK: You are incorrect. The arrival of a Gallifreyan on Kar-Charrat was inevitable. Humans are impatient. Daleks have no such weakness. We have waited.\nACE: But the Doctor hasn't been to the Library for hundreds of years. You can't possibly have waited all that time.\nDALEK: Daleks are dedicated to victory. To that end, we have waited.\nACE: I don't believe you.\nDALEK: Our time corridor technology has allowed us to place operatives on numerous planets waiting for the arrival of a time capsule. Time Lords are devious. The Doctor's weakness is in his companions. You have provided the means for our conquest of this planet.\nACE: It's not true!\nDALEK: By now your duplicate will be in position to deactivate the defence screens. Our stratagem will have been successful. You have helped the Daleks to victory.\nELGIN: Oh dear, I'd forgotten how dreadful these jungles were.\nDOCTOR: Well, the sooner we see this ziggurat, the sooner we can get back into the dry.\nELGIN: Yes, very well. Look, it's just through (pause) oh. Oh, my word.\nDOCTOR: Ah. And you thought I was being melodramatic.\nELGIN: Oh dear. They're not dead, are they?\nDOCTOR: Very. They've both been shot at close range with a powerful projected energy weapon. Oh yes, it's scrambled this Drillian's innards and almost melted the workings of this robot.\nELGIN: Daleks?\nDOCTOR: I think that it's likely, don't you?\nELGIN: Oh! This is dreadful, dreadful. But who are these people? What are they doing here?\nDOCTOR: My guess, they are friends of our mysterious guest back at the Library. They all have similar equipment and weapons. Hmm. I would guess that they are after this ziggurat.\nELGIN: After the ziggurat? Preposterous.\nDOCTOR: Ah, they've got an anti-grav sled, Elgin. And digging equipment. Mmm. As much as if they were planning to make off with your ancient artefact.\nELGIN: But to what end?\nDOCTOR: Ancient artefacts do tend to sell rather well to collectors.\nELGIN: But this is outrageous. These people are little more than criminals, vandals.\nDOCTOR: I rather think that they've been reprimanded more than enough, don't you? Curious.\nELGIN: What?\nDOCTOR: There's a body missing.\nELGIN: Oh Doctor, please. You're being morbid.\nDOCTOR: No, look. The ground here is covered in blood. It's not the young woman's. She's not that badly hurt. And Drillian's blood isn't red. Why would the Daleks remove a body? Assuming that it was the Daleks. Elgin, there isn't another race on this planet, is there?\nELGIN: No. No, of course not. Why do you ask?\nDOCTOR: Ace heard something earlier. Something in the rain. And when I was here before, I seem to remember some talk about a legend. Ghosts in the jungles.\nELGIN: The Phantoms of Kar-Charrat? Oh really, Doctor. Spaceport stories, that's all.\nDOCTOR: Phantoms? Right, where is this ziggurat?\nELGIN: This way. Over here. Oh, mind that. Though I still don't understand why it's so important. Oh, heavens.\nDOCTOR: Extraordinary.\nELGIN: But, the ziggurat is\nDOCTOR: Open. Yes.\nELGIN: Oh, those dreadful people. A priceless artefact, desecrated.\nDOCTOR: Elgin, look at it. It's been opened from the inside. It's designed to do that.\nELGIN: But I don't understand. I've studied the ziggurat for years. It's nothing but a stone artefact of some ceremonial purpose.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I very much doubt that it's made of stone, and its purpose is far from ceremonial.\nELGIN: But if there was something inside it\nDOCTOR: Then whatever it was inside it is probably out here with us.\nDALEK: 2: Humanoid female now in security area.\nDALEK: 3: Battle computer indicates duplicate now mobile within Library complex.\nDALEK: Are the test subjects ready for data acquisition?\nDALEK: 2: Test subjects are primed and ready to receive data. Scientific division is controlling motor functions remotely, so control will be restored when data has been successfully downloaded.\nDALEK: Prepare to move ship from geostationary orbit as soon as signal is received from duplicate.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nELGIN: Oh. Oh, be careful, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Stop fussing, Elgin. Come along. At least it's dry in here.\nELGIN: Oh. Oh. Oh, my word. This is most unusual. There should be burial chambers, vaults, not machines. I don't pretend to understand any of this. What, what is this device?\nDOCTOR: It's a Dalek deep hibernation unit.\nELGIN: Doctor, that is preposterous. The ziggurat has been dated at one thousand two hundred and seventy years old.\nDOCTOR: Then the one in here must have got rather bored. I wonder what activated it?\nDOCTOR: Ah ha.\nELGIN: Isn't that the disagreeable noise your time ship makes?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: And that's a type seventy. This is extraordinary. They have recognition software for the capsules of every time-travelling race, and subspace relays to dozens of other planets in the sector. Mister Elgin, have you ever heard of other ziggurats like this one?\nELGIN: I believe that there are several in this part of the galaxy. Not exactly the same design, of course, but similar enough to assume that they were all built by the same people. There's a book on it back at the Library, if you would er\nDOCTOR: And all of them waiting for a Time Lord. A Time sensitive.\nELGIN: What about all these other devices?\nDOCTOR: Hibernation equipment, mostly. Nutrients to keep the Daleks alive, communication relays, anti-scan devices. That looks like a short range transmat. Oof, they've certainly packed a lot in here.\nELGIN: This looks rather interesting.\nDOCTOR: A replication generator! Oh no.\nELGIN: My dear Doctor, what's, whatever is the matter?\nDOCTOR: It's Ace. I arrogantly assumed that the Daleks would be after me. But it's Ace. She's a Dalek duplicate. We've been tricked, Elgin. The duplicate will shut down the defence grid. Come on. We've got to get back to the Library!\nDALEK: [OC]: Activate computer overrides.\nACE: 2: I obey.\nCOMPUTER: Access to time field generator denied.\nACE: 2: Emergency override protocol V 117 initiate.\nCOMPUTER: Protocol accepted. Select sub-menu.\nACE: 2: Defence grid.\nCOMPUTER: Accepted. Voice confirmation required.\nDALEK: [OC]: Activate voice synthesiser.\nACE: 2: Voice synthesiser\nELGIN: Activated. Release blocks to defence grid control.\nCOMPUTER: Thank you, Librarian Elgin. Defence grid control opening.\nDALEK: [OC]: Deactivate defence controls.\nACE: 2: I obey.\nCOMPUTER: Warning. Defence grid deactivation. Temporal barrier will deactivate in two minutes.\nACE: 2: Advise Dalek Command that they can commence their attack run.\nDALEK: 2: Sensors indicate fluctuations in temporal barrier. Battle computer advises that duplicate has succeeded in deactivating defence grid.\nDALEK: Activate main drive. All battle commanders to attack condition. All Daleks to assault decks. Advise Chief Scientist to activate test subjects.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nCOMPUTER: Temporal barrier will deactivate in one minute forty seconds. Warning. Warning.\nBEV: What? Where the hell am I? Ah! Ow, my leg. What's that? Who's there?\nPHANTOM: Beverley.\nBEV: Oh, I can see you. There's no point hiding in the shadows. Come out.\nPHANTOM: Beverley. Beverley.\nBEV: No, it's not possible. You're dead. I saw you, Rappel, and you're dead.\nPHANTOM: Help us, Beverley. Help us.\nELGIN: Oh, oh, please, do slow down, Doctor. I can't keep up.\nDOCTOR: We must get back to the Library. We cannot let the Daleks get to that data store.\nELGIN: Then go on without me. I must rest.\nDOCTOR: I can't leave you out here alone. For all we know, the Dalek from that hibernation unit is still out here. Oh, all right, Mister Elgin. We will rest for a few minutes.\nELGIN: You're worried, aren't you? About your young friend.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks will keep her alive as long as she is useful to them. After that.\nELGIN: What was that?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure.\nELGIN: Is it the Dalek? The Dalek from the ziggurat?\nDOCTOR: No, no, I don't think so. Elgin, those legends about the Kar-Charrat phantoms.\nELGIN: Doctor, if you're trying to scare me\nDOCTOR: Be quiet. I want to listen.\nELGIN: Oh, there it is again. Come on, Doctor. I, I'm quite rested enough now. I think we should move.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. There's something else on this planet. Something alive, out here in the jungles with us.\nELGIN: Please, Doctor, come on, let's go.\nDOCTOR: One moment, Elgin. If there is something out there, then I would rather like to find out what.\nELGIN: Doctor? What is it? What's happening?\nDOCTOR: A Dalek destroyer, heading for the Library.\nELGIN: Surely they won't get past the defences.\nDOCTOR: If I'm right, then the defences will already be down.\nCOMPUTER: Defence grid deactivated.\nACE: 2: All defences are disabled. There should be no resistance.\nDALEK: Order two squads of Daleks to the wet works facility. Scientific division to prepare for immediate download of data into test subject. This planet is now under Dalek control."

We must send an SOS, get the Marines.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, you're right. And I must get Ace out of that ship, but I doubt that we'd get within a hundred yards of the Library. Well head for my Tardis.\nELGIN: Your ship? Is it out here?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Not too far. Let's just hope that we can get to it before the Daleks. Come on.\nELGIN: Oh, yes.\nDALEK: Locate and exterminate all unnecessary lifeforms. The Doctor and the technical staff are not to be harmed.

The Chief Librarian is also missing.\nDALEK: Duplicate will report the whereabouts of the Doctor.\nACE: 2: The Doctor and Chief Librarian Elgin are in the jungle. The Doctor was becoming suspicious.\nDALEK: The Doctor will attempt to return to his Tardis. It must be located at once. Order a Dalek patrol to the jungle. Maximum urgency. The Doctor must be located and captured.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nDALEK: I will return to the mothership and report to Dalek Command on Skaro. Order the Chief Scientist to prepare the first subject.\nDOCTOR: Quick, down.\nDALEK: (distant) Area nine clear.\nDALEK: 2: (distant) Orbital scans detect humanoid lifeform in vicinity.

Failure to obey orders will mean your immediate extermination. Move! Move!\nBEV: I really should choose my friends more carefully.\nDALEK: Test subject to be linked to facility at once.\nDALEK: 2: A Time Lord brain is necessary to ensure successful data transfer.\nDALEK: We cannot wait. The subject must be linked to the wet works facility at once.\nACE: 2: This is the unidentified human.\nDALEK: You will explain your presence in this facility.\nBEV: I didn't even know this facility existed.\nDALEK: You will explain your presence on this planet.\nBEV: Oh, I always come here in the summer.

You're not even human, are you.\nDALEK: She is a product of superior Dalek technology. You will answer all questions truthfully. What are you doing on this planet?\nBEV: We came here to steal the ziggurat.\nDALEK: How many of you are there on Kar-Charrat?\nBEV: Four. The rest are dead.\nACE: 2: She is no threat to Dalek plans. She is valueless. She should be exterminated.\nDALEK: No. She will be of use. The Doctor may have to be lured from the jungle. She will be part of that lure. Secure her.\nDALEK: 2: Test subject prepared in wet works chamber.\nDALEK: I will supervise procedure.\nDALEK: 2: Wet works chamber now online. Test subject successfully linked to data store. Memory circuits primed. Neural pathways clear.\nDALEK: Activate data retrieval.\nDALEK: 2: Data stream activated.\nDALEK: 3: Files downloading.\nDALEK: 2: Memory circuits engaged. Receiving data.\nDALEK: 3: File retrieval rate increasing. Data download at unacceptable rate. Reduce streams.\nDALEK: 2: Control not possible. Data flow increasing.\nDALEK: 3: Alert. Data being absorbed too quickly. Unable to disengage test subject.\nDALEK: 2: Test subject memory circuits at maximum. Mental stability at risk. Alert! Alert!\nDALEK: 2: Danger. Test subject unstable and aggressive. Motor controls activated.\nDALEK: Wet works facility to be protected at all costs.\nDALEK: 2: Test subject free of restraint.\nDALEK: I am in danger. Alert! Alert!\nDALEK: Pursue rogue Dalek unit. Exterminate.\nDALEK: 4: I obey.\nDALEK: Report.\nDALEK: 2: Data retrieval too rapid for Dalek neural pathways. Reduced rate of data flow will result in increased delay of invasion.\nDALEK: Unacceptable.\nDALEK: 2: Time Lord neural pathways have natural filters that will result in faster data transfer to test subject.\nDALEK: The Doctor is vital to the success of this operation. He must be forced to cooperate.\nDALEK: 3: Scouts report that they have located the Doctor's Tardis.\nDALEK: Order all scouts to remain at that location.\nDALEK: 3: Sensors indicate that the Doctor is still concealed within the jungle.\nDALEK: We will force him to reveal himself. Bring the Doctor's companion from the ship.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nDOCTOR: Blast.\nELGIN: Oh, Doctor, they're all around your ship.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought it might be too easy.\nELGIN: Whatever is out here with us is getting closer.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nELGIN: The rain is getting through your umbrella.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. We do seem to be running out of options.\nELGIN: Doctor, look.\nDOCTOR: Ah, the Dalek Supreme. We should feel honoured, Elgin. He's come to do his own dirty work.\nDALEK: (distant) Doctor, you are surrounded. Surrender to the Daleks and you will not be harmed.\nELGIN: Maybe we should do as he says.\nDOCTOR: He doesn't even know we're here, Elgin.\nDALEK: (distant) Sensors have detected your biorhythms. We know you are in this area.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDALEK: (distant) Observe.\nELGIN: Oh! Oh, my word. They've got your young friend, and Miss Tarrant, and Prink. Oh, this is a disaster. Prink will talk. He'll tell them everything.\nDALEK: (distant) You have five rels to surrender or we will exterminate your companions.\nELGIN: What are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Elgin. I'm thinking.\nDALEK: (distant) Four rels.\nELGIN: Doctor, they'll be killed.\nACE: (distant) Don't do it, Doctor! Get away!\nDOCTOR: They could be bluffing. They could be duplicates.\nDALEK: (distant) Three rels.\nDOCTOR: Then again, what do they need the real Ace for any more?\nELGIN: Doctor.\nDALEK: (distant) Two rels.\nDOCTOR: Under the circumstances, I don't think that we've got any choice, Mister Elgin.\nELGIN: Can we trust them?\nDOCTOR: We can trust them to kill those three if we stay here.\nDALEK: (distant) One rel.\nDOCTOR: Good afternoon, Daleks. How lovely to see you again.\nDALEK: 2: Do not move.\nDALEK: You will remain still. You are now a prisoner of the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it rather looks that way.\nDALEK: 2: Move!\nDOCTOR: All right, all right.\nBEV: I'm moving as fast as I can.\nACE: Sorry, Professor.\nDOCTOR: Don't be silly, Ace. I could hardly sit by and let them shoot you.\nELGIN: Oh, Mister Prink. Whatever has been going on here? Where are the rest of the staff.\nDALEK: All unnecessary human lifeforms have been exterminated.\nELGIN: Exterminated? Oh, no.\nBEV: Murderers.\nDOCTOR: Typical Dalek solution, destroy and never create.\nDALEK: You are mistaken. We intend creating the most advanced lifeform the galaxy has ever seen.\nDOCTOR: A Dalek lifeform, of course.\nDALEK: Daleks are the superior species. It is our destiny. It is our right.\nDOCTOR: Right? To destroy indiscriminately? To take what other have laboured over? You have no right at all.\nDALEK: You will witness the birth of a Dalek with the knowledge that will enable us to overcome all obstacles. There will be no errors this time.\nDOCTOR: And me?\nDALEK: Your knowledge will also be absorbed.\nACE: 2: Temporal barriers now re-established. This facility is now secure.\nACE: Got a frog in your throat? You should get some Strepsils.\nACE: 2: Human woice duplication is no longer necessary. It wastes power.\nACE: Huh. You should get some Duracells. Last longer than most ordinary batteries.\nDALEK: Silence!\nACE: Huh. Touchy, aren't they?\nDOCTOR: Well, let's not over-antagonise them just yet, eh?\nDALEK: 3: Scientific division report damage to wet works control systems caused by rogue Dalek unit. The two humanoid males will assist.\nDOCTOR: Having a bit of trouble, are they? Still reliant on humans to do your dirty work? Well, as the old song goes, you need hands.\nDALEK: You.\nELGIN: Who, me?\nDALEK: You two will follow me to the wet works data store.\nELGIN: Me? Oh, no, no, no. Prink here is the technical genius, aren't you, Prink? Well, say something, Prink.\nPRINK: I, I\nELGIN: Prink, this is no time for false modesty.\nDALEK: You will follow!\nELGIN: Prink!\nDALEK: Remaining humans and the Doctor are to be kept in confinement. You will remain here.\nACE: 2: Understood.\nDALEK: Move!\nELGIN: Come along, Prink. Do as they say.\nDALEK: Move! Move!\nACE: 2: You will remain in the Chief Librarian's office. Any resistance and you will be destroyed.\nACE: Yeah? You and whose army?\nDOCTOR: Ace.\nELGIN: Oh. Oh dear, oh dear. Look at the damage that has been done. Oh please, don't. Let me please put some of these books on the shelf. Oh no, please. Prink, tell them. Tell them.\nDALEK: 3: Humanoids will remain silent.\nPHANTOM: Soon. Soon.\nBEV: Well, isn't this cosy?\nDOCTOR: I don't think we've been properly introduced.\nBEV: Bev Tarrant.\nDOCTOR: Delighted. I'm the Doctor. Ace I believe you know.\nBEV: Yes, both of them. Can't say I'm over-enamoured with your twin.\nACE: I'm not too keen myself.\nDOCTOR: Yes, she does lack your natural charm.\nACE: Ha. Professor, what's going on here? The Daleks said they'd been waiting for centuries.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I found a hibernation unit in the jungle. The Daleks seem to have positioned dozens of them scattered through the system, just waiting for a Time sensitive to try and get into the Library. They used your duplicate to get access to the wet works store, and they're going to create a Dalek with the total knowledge of the universe.\nBEV: But why?\nDOCTOR: A mobile data store that they can use to conquer each planet in the universe one after another. It's an ambitious plan, even for the Daleks.\nACE: And it looks like they've managed it.\nDOCTOR: Not there yet. And I think there is something else at work here. You were right about there being something in the rain.\nBEV: You heard it too.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A very curious wet bubbling noise.\nBEV: Oh, my God.\nACE: What's wrong?\nBEV: I, I thought it was just a dream.\nDOCTOR: What have you heard?\nBEV: In the medical facility, my partner, my dead partner, came to visit. He made a burbling noise. I thought it was just a dream.\nDOCTOR: I wonder.\nELGIN: There. That's the last connection. But I really must stress, I'm not a qualified technician.\nDALEK: 2: Wet works facility ready for Time Lord subject.\nDALEK: Bring the Doctor.\nELGIN: Oh dear, Mister Prink. What have we done?\nBEV: Are you trying to tell me that the Kar-Charrat phantoms are real?\nDOCTOR: Yes. A lifeform in the rainwater that has slipped into legend. What I can't believe is that Elgin and the others didn't know about it.\nACE: 2: You will come with me.\nDOCTOR: What? Tea time already?\nDALEK: Move out of the room.\nACE: Where are you taking him?\nACE: 2: We need his brain.\nACE: Damn you. What are you going to do with him?\nBEV: The more I see of the other you, the less I like you.\nACE: The less I like me, too. We've got to get out of here\nDOCTOR: So, here we all are. How nice.\nDALEK: Move into the machinery.\nDOCTOR: Ah, no tea?\nELGIN: I'm afraid that they intend wiring you into the wet works grid, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I wonder why? No, let me guess. Your Dalek test subject failed to assimilate the data at the acceptable rate, resulting in seizure, and by the look of the mess, madness. Not the most successful of afternoons you've ever had, is it?\nDALEK: We will be successful this time. Your neural pathways will assimilate the data at an acceptable speed. That data will then be fed through to our test subject.\nDOCTOR: I knew I'd come in handy for something.\nDALEK: You will attach the Doctor to the data interface.\nELGIN: Oh, Doctor, I\nDALEK: You will obey.\nDOCTOR: It's all right, Mister Elgin. Do as he says.\nDALEK: 2: Second test subject linked to data grid. Memory buffers primed. Neural pathways clear. You will link the Time Lord to our test subject.\nELGIN: You can't download data through him at the speed that you're attempting. The shock could kill him.\nDALEK: 2: The Time Lord's mind is capable of handling the flow of data.\nELGIN: But the pain.\nDALEK: 2: Irrelevant.\nDALEK: Activate data retrieval.\nELGIN: Good luck, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Mister Elgin.\nDALEK: 2: Data stream activated.\nDALEK: 3: Files downloading.\nDALEK: 2: Memory circuits engaged. Receiving data.\nDALEK: Increase data flow.\nELGIN: You're going to kill him.\nDALEK: 3: Memory loading. Procedure proving successful.\nDALEK: Increase to maximum.\nACE: Oh! Oh God, it's no use. Why do they build library doors so well here?\nBEV: Stops people nicking the books, I suppose. I still can't believe that this place is here.\nACE: Yeah. Well, it's pretty well hidden. What did bring you here?\nBEV: Huh. Money. I had a collector on Coralee willing to pay a lot of money for ancient artefacts. Thought it was an easy heist. A planet that no one comes to, an ancient stone thing that no one would miss? Easy money. Huh. Boy, was I wrong.\nACE: Your partner, Rappel. Was he, well, was he\nBEV: A partner in every sense of the word? Yes. Seeing him alive again, it's tough.\nACE: Well, if the Doctor's right, then it's not him.\nBEV: If the Doctor's right, then it's some alien entity using his corpse. That doesn't exactly make me feel any better.\nACE: Sorry.\nBEV: No. No, it's okay. Come on, let's have another go at this door.\nACE: Wait. Listen. There's something going on outside.\nBEV: Daleks?\nACE: I'm not sure.\nBEV: What was that?\nACE: I\nACE: Uh oh. Here comes trouble.\nACE: What?\nBEV: Oh God. Ace, it's him.\nACE: It's okay, Bev. It's okay.\nBEV: Rappel?\nPHANTOM: We are not Rappel. We merely inhabit his form. We apologise if this is distressing for you, but we struggle to save our race. This was necessary. We wish it was not. We mean no disrespect to your dead.\nBEV: Is, is there anything of Rappel there at all? Do you remember me?\nPHANTOM: Yes. We remember you. Beverly.\nBEV: Are you\nPHANTOM: Dead? Yes. But my feelings are still here.\nBEV: Oh, I'm not sure I can do this, Ace.\nACE: Oh Bey, I know this is going to be hard, but we're out. We're free. So let's go. Rappel, or whoever you are, do you know where the Doctor is?\nPHANTOM: They're holding him in the wet works chamber, but I fear it could be too late.\nACE: What do you mean?\nDALEK: 2: Memory buffers at maximum.\nDALEK: 3: All files successfully downloaded.\nDALEK: Remove test subject from data retrieval.\nDALEK: 4: Test subject now disconnected.\nDALEK: Release remote operation.\nDALEK: 4: Test subject now under self-control.\nDALEK: Report on condition.\nTEST DALEK: (stammers) Knowledge successfully assimilated. Success. I have the complete knowledge from the data store.\nDALEK: Then our mission is complete.\nELGIN: What about the Doctor?\nDALEK: Report on condition of the Doctor.\nDALEK: 2: Neural functions at zero. The Time Lord is dead.\nELGIN: Oh! Oh no.\nDALEK: I will return to the mothership. Prepare to destroy this facility.\nELGIN: Destroy? No, you can't.\nDALEK: Activate Special Weapons Dalek.\nBEV: Ace, this is madness. We're walking deeper and deeper into the lion's den.\nACE: I'm not leaving the Doctor.\nBEV: But you heard what Ra, what he said. The Doctor is probably already dead.\nACE: And until I know that for certain, then I'm not leaving. He wouldn't leave me.\nBEV: Shh. Listen.\nACE: That sound again.\nPHANTOM: There is something approaching.\nBEV: I think we'd better get out of here.\nACE: I think it's too late for that.\nMAD DALEK: Out of control. Out of control. Alert. Pain. Alert. Out of control.\nBEV: My God, what's wrong with it?\nACE: God knows. Perhaps he can't see us.\nMAD DALEK: Unauthorised humanoids detected.\nACE: Then again.\nMAD DALEK: You will be exterminated. Exterminate! Exterminate!"

Get outside!\nPHANTOM: You must hide in the jungles. I will hold it at bay.\nBEV: Hell, no. Don't be stupid.\nPHANTOM: Run, Beverly.\nBEV: Rappel!\nMAD DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!\nBEV: No, not again! No, no.\nACE: Close your eyes. Close your eyes!\nMAD DALEK: Target destroyed. Retargetting on remaining humanoids.\nACE: Wait a minute. What's the matter with it?\nMAD DALEK: Vision impaired. I cannot see. Sensors indicate unknown lifeform in aqueous precipitation. Lifeform invading casing. Water levels increasing to above tolerance. Motor functions disabled. Weaponry offline. Am losing control. Losing control. Argh.\nBEV: What the hell happened?\nACE: Beats me.\nBEV: Rappel?\nACE: There's nothing left of him, Bev.\nPHANTOM: No,\nBEV: Who said that?\nPHANTOM: He is still here, in us.\nBEV: Where? Where are you?\nPHANTOM: In the rain. We live in the rain.\nACE: And the Doctor?\nPHANTOM: He is with us.\nACE: What?\nDOCTOR: Hello? (echoes) Hello?\nPHANTOM: Welcome.\nDOCTOR: I can't see you. As it happens, I can't see me. Where's my body?\nPHANTOM: It is where you left it. You were on the brink of death.\nDOCTOR: I remember pain, and then nothing.\nPHANTOM: We saved you. We brought you here.\nDOCTOR: But where is here, exactly?\nPHANTOM: You are in the data store.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Wet works.\nPHANTOM: We assimilated your consciousness, and brought you into us. You have become part of the data.\nDOCTOR: And you?\nPHANTOM: We are the wet work store. We are all that is left of the people of Kar-Charrat.\nELGIN: Oh Prink, they've killed him. The Doctor, dead, and it's all my fault. I should never have set up those machines. You monsters! Look what you've done. How can I ever live with myself? Oh Prink, what are we to do?\nDALEK: 3: Mothership reports that rogue Dalek unit has been destroyed by unknown forces.\nDALEK: Lead squad seven to investigate. Activate Special Weapons Dalek.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nDALEK: Advise.\nTEST DALEK: The aquatic lifeform native to this planet is capable of invading our casings and rendering us inoperative.\nDALEK: You will advise assault squads on correct procedure for extermination of these lifeforms.\nTEST DALEK: The lifeforms are non-hostile. They do not require extermination.\nDALEK: You will obey!\nTEST DALEK: Their destruction is not necessary.\nDALEK: You will obey!\nACE: So you're an aquatic lifeform.\nPHANTOM: Not in the sense that you know it. We don't live in the rivers and oceans. We are the rivers and oceans.\nACE: And the rain.\nPHANTOM: Any water can hold our presence.\nBEV: Including people.\nPHANTOM: Lifeforms such as yourselves are made up of so much water that it is easy for us to live within you, yes. But no lifeforms ever come here, so no one is aware of the genocide of our race, of the crimes of the Librarian. When you arrived, we tried to talk to you. We tried to talk to you both.\nACE: Oh, the voices in the rain.\nPHANTOM: Yes. And when we failed, we found the body of the one called Rappel. He could take us where we could not go. He could take us where it was dry, and gave us the power to communicate with your kind.\nBEV: So you are the phantoms. The phantoms of Kar-Charrat.\nPHANTOM: Elgin and the others spread that rumour so no one would ever take our voices seriously.\nACE: But why? What has Elgin been doing to you?\nDOCTOR: Are you saying that your entire race is in here with us?\nPHANTOM: All but a few that escaped. This storage facility is no technological miracle engineered by Elgin. It is a prison. A prison where every piece of data is carried in the mind of one of our race. We have suffered in here while the universe has gone on oblivious to us.\nDOCTOR: So every drop of liquid in here is a living being? This is obscene!\nPHANTOM: It is only through our determination that we retain any identity of self. We have lost so many, their minds wiped clean to hold the data. Your arrival has brought us hope. Will you help us, Doctor? Will you help to free us?\nDOCTOR: How do I get back to my body?\nPHANTOM: Part of the data that makes up your mind can be downloaded back into your physical form. But beware. The Daleks intend to destroy this facility. If they do so, then we are lost forever.\nDALEK: Test subject is behaving erratically.\nDALEK: 2: Scans indicate increasing neural activity outside of computer projections.\nDALEK: Failure to obey commands cannot be tolerated.\nDALEK: 2: Remote control cannot be re-established.\nDALEK: It may be necessary to prepare another test subject.\nDALEK: 2: The death of the Time Lord will affect speed of transfer.\nDALEK: The Librarian Elgin will be fitted to the machine.\nELGIN: No. No, you can't do\nDALEK: 2: His brain is not as suitable as that of the Doctor. His destruction will be certain.\nELGIN: Oh God.\nDALEK: Then we will continue to use the remaining humanoids.\nELGIN: You can't do this. It's inhuman.\nDALEK: I must report to Skaro. You will report to the main laboratory. Prepare another test subject. Report if it is necessary to destroy existing subject.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nELGIN: Oh, God.\nDALEK: You are to be kept alive. You will remain here until we have conducted our tests. Leave this room and you will be destroyed.\nELGIN: Oh, Prink, this is dreadful. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you to talk to.\nPHANTOM: Now, Doctor, the Dalek creatures have gone. Just the Librarians remain. Are you prepared?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. As I'll ever be.\nPHANTOM: We will download your consciousness into your physical form. Do nothing. Just relax.\nDOCTOR: Here goes.\nCOMPUTER: Data retrieval online. Downloading.\nDOCTOR: Ow, oh. Ah.\nELGIN: Doctor? Prink, look. He's alive. Oh, my dear Doctor, I thought you were dead.\nDOCTOR: By the time I'm finished with you, Elgin, you'll wish I was.\nELGIN: I don't understand.\nDOCTOR: To think I counted you among my friends. Oh, you could be pompous, arrogant, selfish, but now I find the enemies I have fought are like children compared to the obscene crimes that you are responsible for.\nELGIN: I, I\nDOCTOR: An entire race, Elgin, trapped in your vile machine. Sentient creatures trapped and aware, unable to move, unable to think for themselves, unable to laugh or cry or love, used by men like you who have the audacity to call themselves civilised. This thing is little more than a gulag. You are an abomination no better than the Daleks. I should leave you to them. Where are the rest of your people?\nELGIN: Dead. It's only me and Prink left.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks?\nELGIN: They've returned to their ship. They mentioned something about a Special Weapons Dalek. They intend to destroy this facility when they leave.\nDOCTOR: Good. Let's just make sure they don't destroy its inhabitants. Is there a way out of here?\nELGIN: Yes. Yes, over here. We'll never get past the Daleks, though.\nDOCTOR: Let me worry about that.\nELGIN: Doctor, I'm so\nDOCTOR: Be quiet, Elgin! At the moment, I have nothing more to say to you. Now come on.\nDALEK: Dalek Supreme on Kar-Charrat to Emperor at Skaro Control.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Report.\nDALEK: Operation successful. Test subject operational.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Then destroy the facility.\nDALEK: Patrols have encountered unknown hostiles.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Make use of data from test subject to analyse hostiles.\nDALEK: Test subject behaving erratically. Scientific division advise further test subject created and analysis carried out.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Unacceptable. Test subject must be returned to Skaro immediately. The knowledge is needed to implement final plans for our invasion. Kar-Charrat facility must be destroyed as soon as all data is in our possession. The Doctor will also be returned to Skaro for interrogation.\nDALEK: It was necessary to use the Doctor for successful transfer of data from wet works store. He could not survive the process.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: You have been inefficient. You have failed the Daleks. Destroy the facility and return to Skaro immediately.\nDALEK: I obey.\nELGIN: Doctor\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Elgin.\nELGIN: Yes, but Doctor, I just wanted to explain.\nDOCTOR: I've had all the explanations I need. What about you, Mister Prink? Did you know about this? Or is it all Librarian Elgin's doing?\nELGIN: Doctor, Daleks!\nDOCTOR: Quick, hide.\nDALEK: (distant) Upper levels now clear. Human females have escaped from this facility.\nDALEK: 2: (distant) Hoverbot patrols will sweep jungle area.\nDALEK: (distant) Remains of initial test subject to be taken to Chief Scientist for analysis. You will assist.\nDOCTOR: I didn't think that Ace would remain locked up for long. Looks like she's been busy.\nELGIN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Large holes blown in walls tend to be her trademark. And that's our way out. Come on.\nDALEK: Report.\nDALEK: 2:: Casing has been invaded by aquatic lifeform. Liquid levels have been increased to beyond acceptable tolerances. The Dalek creature has been drowned in its life support chamber.\nBEV: Well, I feel a lot happier now that I've got a blaster again.\nACE: How's the ship?\nBEV: All the systems are operational, but the energy signature is bound to attract the Daleks. I daren't power anything up and it's going to get cold out here soon.\nACE: Well, we daren't light a fire. The Daleks are bound to spot that too.\nDOCTOR: Very true, but it might have made my job of finding you easier.\nACE: Professor! I thought you were dead.\nELGIN: So did Prink and I, didn't we, Prink?\nDOCTOR: Well, technically, bits of me were. But as you can see, I'm back in one piece. You seem to have made quite a mess of the Library.\nACE: Not guilty. That was a Dalek with an attitude problem.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it wouldn't have been the most stable of Daleks. And how did you destroy that?\nPHANTOM: We are responsible for its destruction, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I've met others of your kind, in the wet work store.\nPHANTOM: Then you understand what we need.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We have to find a way of releasing the liquid contained in the data store into the rain. Now then, Ace. What do you think we should do?\nACE: Hmm. Blow a hole in the roof?\nDOCTOR: What an excellent idea.\nDALEK: The prisoners have escaped.\nACE: 2: And the Doctor's body is gone. He is still alive.\nDALEK: He will attempt to reach his Tardis. There is a possibility he will be successful.\nACE: 2: Dalek units are vulnerable to attack by indigenous lifeforms. / will be more efficient.\nDALEK: The Doctor must be prevented from reaching his Tardis.\nACE: 2: I obey.\nACE: If this place is kept so secret, how did the Daleks find out about it?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. Care to shed any light on the subject, Elgin?\nELGIN: I don't know. Some of our collectors could have been forced to talk, I suppose. Or Prink. He is such a blabbermouth, after all.\nDOCTOR: Whereas you say nothing about anything, of course.\nACE: Why are you coming down on him so hard, Professor?\nDOCTOR: Elgin and the others have been using the Kar-Charratans as their data store, systematically capturing them and imprisoning them in their tanks.\nELGIN: I think that imprison is a little harsh, Doctor. After all, it's not like we knew they were intelligent.\nDOCTOR: Did you bother to try and find out? I mean, did you ever try to communicate?\nELGIN: I, I. No. The Library, you see. It's been my life's work. I, I\nACE: What have they been doing?\nDOCTOR: The Librarians have been capturing the Kar-Charratans, wiping their minds clean, and implanting data from their Library.\nBEV: My God.\nDOCTOR: It's one of the most clinically brutal acts I've ever had the misfortune to witness.\nELGIN: Oh Doctor, you have no idea.\nDOCTOR: I have every idea. Shut up, Elgin.\nACE: So blowing up the tanks will release them back into the rain?\nDOCTOR: Not quite that simple. I've got to activate a data transfer at the same time that the tanks shatter, freeing the minds of the\nDOCTOR: Kar-Charratans. Ah, there's the Tardis.\nBEV: Uh oh. Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Two guards.\nBEV: How are we going to get past them?\nDOCTOR: I was rather hoping our aqueous friends would handle that for us.\nPHANTOM: Wait here. We will disable the guards.\nBEV: I don't think I'm ever going to get used to talking to raindrops.\nDOCTOR: Careful what you say. Your hair is full of them.\nBEV: Thanks for reminding me. God knows what I'm going to do if I want a drink. So, this waterfall.\nDOCTOR: It's probably their equivalent of a major city.\nACE: Professor, look.\nDALEK: I am losing control.\nDALEK: 2: I am losing control.\nDALEK: Detect humanoids approaching.\nDALEK: 2: I cannot see.\nDALEK: Systems malfunctioning.\nPHANTOM: The way to your ship is clear, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Right. Come on, everybody.\nDOCTOR: Right, everyone inside.\nELGIN: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What is it, Elgin?\nELGIN: I can hear something coming. I think that ah!\nACE: Elgin!\nACE: 2: Too late, Doctor.\nBEV: Oh, my God. She's going to throw him over the edge.\nELGIN: Doctor! Don't let her drop me. Please, don't let her drop me!\nACE: 2: Almost, Doctor, but not quite.\nDOCTOR: Let him go.\nACE: 2: And lose my advantage? Humanoid lifeforms do not react well to being dropped from great heights. Obey my instructions or I drop Librarian Elgin.\nDOCTOR: I said, let him go.\nACE: You heard what the Doctor said, metal head. Back off.\nBEV: I'll shoot.\nACE: 2: What, and let us both die?\nDOCTOR: Put the gun down, Beverly.\nACE: 2: Pathetic. The Daleks duplicate you, duplicate a form vastly superior in so many ways. But this reliance on sentiment. You have the potential to be so much more. And yet all I have to do is loosen my grip.\nACE: No!\nDOCTOR: All right, all right.\nELGIN: Oh, my word! Please, please, don't drop me. Please.\nACE: 2: You will surrender the Tardis to us, Doctor. Another valuable weapon in the Dalek's ever-expanding Empire.\nPRINK: No!\nELGIN: Prink, what are you doing?\nPRINK: Give me that gun.\nDOCTOR: Prink, get back.\nPRINK: No. There have been too many senseless killings in my Library, and I have had enough.\nACE: 2: You will put down the weapon and remain where you are.\nDOCTOR: Prink, no!\nPRINK: Let him go.\nACE: Quick, save Elgin, Doctor.\nELGIN: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Oh no, now it's got Prink!\nACE: 2: Flesh and blood against Dalek technology. Foolish human.\nDOCTOR: Prink!\nACE: 2: Humans. So fragile. All I have to do is twist. (crack) And you die.\nELGIN: Prink! Noooo!\nPHANTOM: You too can die, Dalek creature.\nACE: 2: There is no organic element for you to invade. I cannot be drowned.\nPHANTOM: But Mister Prink has blown a hole through your watertight skin. How much water can you hold?\nACE: Professor, look at the waterfall.\nBEV: Dear God, it's moving!\nACE: 2: Internal circuits overloading. Balance impaired. Weight exceeding engineering tolerances.\nDOCTOR: Now, while it's off balance. Push!\nDOCTOR: Now that's something I don't want to have to do too often.\nACE: Youte telling me.\nBEV: I hate to be a pain, but we did kill the right one, didn't we?\nACE: Oi!\nDOCTOR: Yes. This one's warm.\nACE: Get off.\nDOCTOR: Daleks never get that right.\nELGIN: Prink, oh Prink. Doctor, Doctor, is he?\nDOCTOR: Dead.\nELGIN: Oh no. No.\nDOCTOR: And the best tribute we can give him is to destroy the thing that he helped create.\nACE: Great. So all we have to do is get back into a Library crawling with Daleks, set explosives, and get out again before they go off.\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Ace. So I hope you've ignored everything that I've ever told you about Nitro-9.\nDALEK: 2: No signal from duplicate.\nDALEK: Prepare to abandon facility.\nDALEK: 3: Alert. Sensors indicate space-time disturbance. Arrival of time vessel in this vicinity imminent.\nDALEK: All Daleks prime weapons.\nACE: (as Ace 2) The Doctor and his Tardis have been captured.\nDALEK: Your transponder has stopped transmitting. Why are you using human voice synthesis?\nACE: I sustained damage.\nDALEK: Doctor. You will be returned to Skaro for interrogation by the Emperor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You've finally defeated me.\nDALEK: Where are the other humanoids?\nACE: Destroyed. It was unavoidable.\nDALEK: Prepare to move time vessel to mothership. We are abandoning this facility.\nACE: I obey.\nDALEK: Special Weapons Dalek to wet works chamber.\nTEST DALEK: The destruction of this facility serves no purpose.\nDALEK: We must ensure that all knowledge is retained by the Daleks only.\nTEST DALEK: The placement of guard units is sufficient.\nDALEK: You will obey!\nTEST DALEK: Your orders are not logical. Mine is the superior intellect. I will assume the position of authority.\nDALEK: You will obey orders! We will destroy this facility and return to Skaro.\nTEST DALEK: No.\nDOCTOR: Well, that's going to keep them busy. I didn't think no was in the Dalek vocabulary.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Arguing amongst themselves.\nBEV: Come on, Ace. Come on.\nELGIN: She's not going to make it. They're bound to see her.\nDALEK: Wait. Where is the duplicate?\nDALEK: 2: Duplicate at wet work storage tanks.\nDALEK: She is placing explosives. You are not the duplicate.\nACE: Too right, mate.\nDALEK: Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: Leave her alone.\nTEST DALEK: She is not to be harmed.\nDALEK: You will obey.\nTEST DALEK: Life must be protected.\nDALEK: All Dalek units to wet works chamber. I am under attack. I am under attack!\nDALEK: 2: Fire-power ineffective. Test subject increasing power to casing shielding.\nDALEK: Special Weapons Dalek to open fire. Advise mothership to prepare for immediate take-off.\nSW DALEK: Targeting. Exterminate.\nTEST DALEK: Damage to casing superficial. Desist or I will retaliate.\nSW DALEK: Recalibrating. Exterminate.\nDOCTOR: Ace, how long before they blow?\nACE: We've got seconds!\nBEV: Come on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Got to set the data download at the same time as the tanks rupture.\nBEV: Well, hurry it up.\nDOCTOR: I am hurrying. There! Come on, Ace, into the Tardis.\nBEV: Cut that a bit fine, didn't you?\nDOCTOR: Close the doors, Ace.\nACE: Okay, Professor.\nELGIN: Doctor\nDOCTOR: Out of the way, Elgin. I've got to dematerialise before the explosives blow.\nSW DALEK: Test subject destroyed.\nDALEK: 3: Dalek Supreme aboard mothership. Mothership lifting off.\nDALEK: 2: Remove explosives from data storage tanks. Remove explosives!\nDALEK: 3: Explosives at critical\nDALEK: 2: Aqueous lifeforms invading casing. Water exceeding tolerance. Losing control.\nDALEK: Dalek Supreme on Kar-Charrat to Emperor on Skaro.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Report.\nDALEK: Mission a failure. Test subject destroyed. Special Weapons Dalek destroyed. Dalek assault force destroyed. Data facility destroyed.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: How?\nDALEK: Unknown alien lifeform and the intervention of the Doctor.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: The loss of the data store has jeopardised our plans. You have failed.\nDALEK: It was unavoidable.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Reasons are irrelevant. Failure is unacceptable. Order Chief Scientist to take command of mothership.\nDALEK: I obey.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Set self-destruct.\nDALEK: I obey.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Activate.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: The Daleks will succeed. The loss of the wet works is a setback, but we will find an alternative plan. We will continue in our battle to become the supreme beings of the universe!\nACE: Well, that's made a mess of the books.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Another wonder lost to the universe.\nELGIN: My Library! My beautiful Library.\nDOCTOR: It was a mistake, Elgin, knowledge at the cost of a species.\nELGIN: Yes. Yes.\nPHANTOM: Doctor, we are free. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Did all your people make it?\nPHANTOM: Most require healing, some will never recover. But in the streams and the clouds we will help them.\nDOCTOR: I'm glad.\nPHANTOM: Now we can reclaim our planet.\nDOCTOR: I've turned off the temporal barriers. Soon the jungle will claim the Library. It will be as though it's always been here.\nACE: The Daleks?\nDOCTOR: Drowned in their casings.\nACE: Oh, that's horrible.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The Daleks always bring out the worst in people. And the worst in me.\nBEV: Well, I doubt anyone is going to chastise you for it.\nACE: Where will you go, Bev?\nBEV: Back to my ship. Away from here. The ghosts on Kar-Charrat have become a little too real for me. Goodbye, Ace. Doctor.\nACE: Bye.\nDOCTOR: Bye.\nACE: Will she be all right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think so. The universe always has room for a talented thief.\nACE: What about him?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. What will you do now, Mister Elgin?\nELGIN: Everything I knew here is dead, Doctor. My staff, my friends, my work.\nDOCTOR: But your work was criminal.\nELGIN: Oh, I know that now. But at the time, I, oh, all that knowledge and I could still be so stupid.\nDOCTOR: I'll send a message to the Time Lords, Elgin. The High Council will send a team. Can we take you somewhere?\nELGIN: No, Doctor. I'll wait here for the Time Lords to arrive. See if we can salvage some of the books.\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Elgin.\nELGIN: Goodbye, Doctor.\nACE: Doctor, that Dalek. The one that saved us. It could have changed the Daleks, couldn't it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Strange. A Dalek that has acquired the wisdom of the universe might have helped user in an entirely new era for them. Who knows.\nACE: Do you think we've stopped them?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I doubt it. They will continue to spread through the universe, killing, destroying. We might have delayed them. I don't know. Oh, I have to look it up.\nACE: In a book?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Ace. In a good, old-fashioned book."
