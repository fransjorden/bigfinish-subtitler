You are a military man, Major?\nDA COSTA: Retired. But until I can determine that you’re not a threat, it’s my duty to protect everyone on this base.\nDOCTOR: Base, you say?\nDA COSTA: Foreman Bryce, call a guard to come and lock these people up.\nBRYCE: Lock them up where, sir? We don’t have cells or nothing!\nDA COSTA: Secure storeroom. Just do it, Bryce!\nBRYCE: (EXITING) Major!\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Doctor, what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: Now we get locked up. Why break the habit of six lifetimes?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. CAR/EXT. COMPOUND\nMACHT: Here, driver. (FX: CAR PULLING OVER ONTO GRAVEL AND COMING TO\nSTOP THROUGH: ) (TO ZETTERLING) There’s Da Costa. This had\nSTOP THROUGH: better be good, to make me forfeit my golf game.\nZETTERLING: You would have lost, anyway. You’re lousy at golf. Lousy at all sports, come to think of it. I don’t know why you bother. You know you don’t play well with others, Hugo.\nMACHT: Come on.\nMACHT: (FX: THEY OPEN PASSENGER DOORS AND GET OUT ONTO GRAVEL,\nSLAMMING DOORS BEHIND THROUGH: )\nDA COSTA: (APPROACHING) Doctor Macht. Professor Zetterling. Sorry to drag you out here at the weekend.\nMACHT: (CURT) Skip the pleasantries, Major.\nZETTERLING: (SHIVERS) Kinda chilly. — What have we got, Vincent?\nDA COSTA: Less than an hour ago we found two people inside the phase six site excavation. A man and a woman, [they —]\nMACHT: Whoa! Wait, wait, wait! Major, you’re supposed to be head of site security. How did two trespassers get that far inside the perimeter?\nDA COSTA: Sir, if you’1ll let me finish. They weren’t inside the facility, they were inside the excavation itself.\nZETTERLING: What...?\nDA COSTA: That low hill the crew was scheduled to level? It’s a tomb or something. There’s bodies, bones and relics all over the place... and a big blue box.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 16\nMACHT: Bodies?\nDA COSTA: Ancient. Like, really ancient.\nZETTERLING: The hill was dug open and, what? There they were?\nDA COSTA: That’s how Foreman Bryce tells it, ma’am.\nMACHT: (STRESSED) No, no, no! Not this. Not now!\nZETTERLING: (ASIDE) Hugo, take a breath.\nMACHT: (ASIDE) You take a breath, Lisa! It’s my money and my reputation on the line here! This is a multi-billion dollar investment. We go fully operational in six weeks with the whole world watching!\nZETTERLING: (ASIDE) All I’m saying is wait and see what’s happened. You might be worrying over nothing.\nMACHT: (ASIDE) Really? If that ‘hill’ proves to be a native American burial mound, the Department of the Interior’s going to have archaeologists and experts crawling all over it.\nZETTERLING: Yeah, maybe.\nMACHT: (ASIDE) They could hold up the program for months! Years! Instead of being the man who saved the world, I’ll bea laughing stock! Worse, I’11 be broke!\nDA COSTA: Uh, Dr Macht?\nMACHT: Yes!\nDA COSTA: The stuff we found didn’t look like native American remains to me. There were swords and helmets and... well, they kinda looked like Vikings.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 17\nMACHT: Vikings?\nDA COSTA: Like in that Two-D Kirk Douglas movie.\nZETTERLING: (PUZZLED) What’s so funny? It’s long been conjectured that Vikings made it to America. If this is for real, if this is hard evidence... it could re-write the history books!\nMACHT: But it won’t, because it’s a hoax. At least, that’s how we’ll Spin it if word gets out. A scheme cooked up by those eco- evangelical nut-jobs who reckon we should let Mother Earth heal herself rather than do it ourselves.\nZETTERLING: But if it’s genuine?\nMACHT: Who cares? We keep the site locked down, clear all non- essential personnel. The computer pretty much runs everything anyway. Once we’re up and running no-one will dare to try messing with us!\nZETTERLING: How can you be so sure?\nMACHT: Because, Professor Zetterling, I’ve built a career on knowing what people want. We’re saving the world, remember? Anyone who gets in our way is the bad guy in this!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. SECURE STOREROOM\nCONSTANCE: (SHIVERING) Why is it so cold in here? We’re in the Wild West. Cowboys, cacti and deserts.\nDOCTOR: Air-conditioning, Mrs Clarke. The human race does love messing about with its environment, for better or worse. They’d shift the world on its axis if they thought it would make them more comfortable. — Hence that monstrosity through the window.\nCONSTANCE: (FX: PARTS WINDOW BLIND) I’ve never seen anything like it. It must be the size of St Paul’s.\nDOCTOR: As terraforming machines go it’s a modest effort. I’ve seen some the size of moons.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, but what does it do, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Do you notice that gritty feeling between your teeth?\nCONSTANCE: Now you mention it.. yes. Yes, I do.\nDOCTOR: Nanites. Self-replicating, microscopic robots. The geo-engine seeds the atmosphere with them in infinitesimal numbers.\nCONSTANCE: (PUZZLED) What for?\nDOCTOR: Earth in this epoch is fighting a losing battle with climate change. Pollutants — like factory smog — are heating up the planet. Greenhouse gases are melting the ice caps and causing environmental collapse.\nCONSTANCE: I presume that’s bad.\nDOCTOR: Catastrophic.\nCONSTANCE: Well, can’t it be stopped?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 19\nDOCTOR: They’re trying. The nanites are an attempt to arrest the process by attacking the pollutants on a sub-atomic level. Scrubbing the sky clean. That gritty taste is the spent machines in the air. Completely harmless.\nCONSTANCE: (SOMBRE) Oh, Doctor, what did we do?\nDOCTOR: Constance?\nCONSTANCE: For it to come to this? The war, my war. The sacrifices we made so the future would be much brighter. Good men and women gave their lives and for what? So their heirs could poison the planet?\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) It does get better, I promise. Mankind does eventually realise its potential and spreads to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, right up until the end of time.\nCONSTANCE: But there are still wars... and worse?\nDOCTOR: Two steps forwards, one step back. Things do improve though. The hand of man —\nCONSTANCE: And woman.\nDOCTOR: And woman, will one day reach out and touch every star in the sky.\nCONSTANCE: You’re certain?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen it. Trust me.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: INTERIOR DOOR CLUNKS OPEN. 3 X FOOTSTEPS WALKING BRISKLY THROUGH, ALONG CORRIDOR)\nMACHT: Where are they?\nDA COSTA: Down here. I’ve locked them in one of the secure storerooms until we call in the Feds.\nZETTERLING: The Bureau?\nMACHT: Which we’re not going to. Not yet at least. I want to get a look at these people first. See what they have to say for themselves.\nZETTERLING: Can we even do that? Detain them?\nDA COSTA: Here we are. Sir. Ma’am.\nMACHT: Go ahead, Major.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. SECURE STOREROOM [CONTINUOUS ]\nMACHT: (LAUGHING) Well, now. What do we have here?\nDOCTOR: Ah! The mysterious ‘doctor’, I presume. — Makes a change for me to say [that.]\nDOCTOR: (BREAKS OFF) Is something amusing you?\nMACHT: Aw, come on. No-one told me the circus had come to town! Did you get dressed in the dark or what?\nZETTERLING: Dr Macht, that’s not appropriate.\nCONSTANCE: No, it isn’t.\nMACHT: Sorry, sorry. I let my mouth run off without engaging my brain sometimes. But, er, when I was told someone had been caught breaking into the facility — well, you two were not what I expected!\nCONSTANCE: That’s reasonable.\nDOCTOR: I suppose so —\nCONSTANCE: Kindly note, however, “Doctor”, that we didn’t “break in” anywhere!\nZETTERLING: Let’s try all that again, shall we? I’m Professor Zetterling, this is my boss Dr Macht, and Major Da Costa you know.\nDOCTOR: There, that’s better. — How do you do, Professor Zetterling. I’m the Doctor and this is my friend, Mrs Clarke.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 22\nMACHT: A doctor. Doctor of what?\nDA COSTA: Yeah, that’s what I was wondering.\nDOCTOR: Just... the Doctor.\nMACHT: Well, ‘just the Doctor’, you and Mrs Clarke here are in more trouble than you can care to imagine.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. I can imagine quite a lot.\nCONSTANCE: (ASIDE) That’s not helping.\nMACHT: How did you get in here undetected? Are there any others?\nDA COSTA: What are you, anyway? Gaia-nauts, or that monkey-wrenching Earth First outfit?\nDOCTOR: One at a time, please! — Mrs Clarke and I are travellers in time and space. We intercepted a significant burst of Artron energy in the time vortex and tracked it to this location.\nMACHT: (SCEPTICAL) Travellers?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDA COSTA: In time and space?\nDOCTOR: Correct.\nMACHT: Do you take us for morons?\nDOCTOR: ‘Morons’ is a little strong, [but]\nCONSTANCE: That’s enough, all of you!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 23\nZETTERLING: Mrs Clarke here has a point. — “Doctor”, you need to do better than that.\nDOCTOR: You want proof of my credentials, Professor? Very well. The metallic tang we’re all tasting indicates elevated levels of expired nanite matter — short-circuited by the backwash from the Artron energy.\nDA COSTA: Y'know, I thought it was just me but I’ve been tasting metal all day!\nMACHT: Professor Zee?\nZETTERLING: (CAUGHT OUT) I... (HURRIEDLY; WITH “A SLIGHT ELEVATION IN HER BREATHING” — SEE SCENE 11) Nanite redundancies are only to be\nZETTERLING: expected. Nothing out of the ordinary.\nMACHT: Guess that’s you crashed and burned, Doc. So you watch the documentary channels. You know a bit of jargon. So what?\nDOCTOR: My ship, my TARDIS, is in the barrow. Take us there and I can prove it to you!\nZETTERLING: Your ship?\nMACHT: (SMILING) We might just go and do that. You two can stay here though. Professor, Major Da Costa?\nCONSTANCE: You can’t just leave us locked up!\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING TO FOLLOW) Professor Zetterling, I urge you to check for elevated levels of nanite wastage. As a scientist you know as well as I do the law of conservation of energy: energy cannot be destroyed but it can change form. Ergo, it is here, some-[where! ]\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nMACHT: Clever, very clever!\nZETTERLING: Care to share?\nMACHT: Coco the clown back there and his ‘friend’. They’re an elaborate distraction, that’s the only explanation. A sideshow to keep us looking the other way while their compatriots sabotage the geo-engine.\nDA COSTA: Sir, the computer’s visual recognition software logs and tracks all members of staff and visitors. Anyone not on the database is red-flagged immediately. It hasn’t happened.\nMACHT: (IRRITATED) So maybe they’re already on the system? Maybe we have a traitor? A sell-out?\nZETTERLING: Even so, it’s still quite a leap.\nMACHT: Well, how would you explain what they’re doing here?\nZETTERLING: All I know is you can’t simply throw a spanner in these works. The geo-engine is a hideously complex machine the size of a small mountain full of back-ups and self-maintaining systems. Even I don’t understand all of it.\nMACHT: (ANGRY) Then maybe they got someone smarter than you to mess with it? Did that occur to anyone? So go and do stuff, Lisa! Push buttons, pull levers, check it all out! (STORMING OFF) Why am I the only one who thinks of these things?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. SECURE STOREROOM\nDOCTOR: What a thoroughly irritating little man. ‘Watch the documentary channels‘, indeed! Let me assure you, [Constance]\nCONSTANCE: Never mind Dr Macht. It was the Professor who interested me more.\nDOCTOR: She wasn’t much better.\nCONSTANCE: No, she was hiding something.\nDOCTOR: Hiding something? When?\nCONSTANCE: About these — what was it? Nanite redundancies. Couldn’t you see it?\nDOCTOR: Her body language, you mean?\nCONSTANCE: I wouldn’t know about that. A slight elevation in her breathing, perhaps. A bit too quick to close the conversation.\nDOCTOR: You know, Constance, you may be on to something...!\nCONSTANCE: Also, the footprints in the tomb. They were small, like mine.\nDOCTOR: A woman’s, you mean?\nCONSTANCE: It’s possible. But why remove the shield from the Chieftain’s chest and say nothing about the barrow’s existence, even?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t the foggiest notion. Our priority has to be to get back to the TARDIS. Conduct our own analysis of the immediate atmosphere.\nCONSTANCE: How? Bars on the window. A heavy lock on the door...\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 26\nDOCTOR: You forget, Mrs Clarke — this isn’t a cell, it’s a storeroom. So... (SEARCHING THROUGH CLINKING JARS & BOTTLES) .. there must be\nDOCTOR: something on these shelves to help us escape!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, it’s a food store!\nDOCTOR: Well, then — we’1ll just have to cook something up, won’t we?\nCONSTANCE: What?\nDOCTOR: Trust me.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. GEO-ENGINE CONTROL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP SOFTLY BLEEPING DATABANKS ETC. ZETTERLING CONCLUDES CLATTERING AT A KEYBOARD)\nZETTERLING: Done and done! — As you asked, Hugo, I’ve run a deep diagnostic of the primary and secondary systems — right down to the root code.\nMACHT: And?\nZETTERLING: All clean and green across the board.\nMACHT: (SCEPTICAL) So you’re saying there’s nothing to worry about. Nothing unusual occurring.\nZETTERLING: Absolutely not.\nMACHT: Look out the window, Lisa.\nZETTERLING: The window, w-[hy] (REALISATION) It... it’s snowing!\nMACHT: Started coming down a minute or two ago. Thought I’d let you finish first.\nZETTERLING: But it’s July!\nMACHT: Is it the geo-engine? The terraformer? Could it be making it snow?\nZETTERLING: Theoretically, yes...\nMACHT: I’d say it’s more than a theory now, wouldn’t you?\nZETTERLING: This is insane. There’s no test scheduled. According to my read-outs, nothing’s happening!\nMACHT: This is what I was talking about. This is sabotage, right here!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: EXT. TERRAFORMER FACILITY\nCONSTANCE: Well, that was remarkably easy— (REALISATION) Doctor, it’s snowing!\nDOCTOR: Yes, the weather would seem to have taken an unexpected turn.\nCONSTANCE: Snowing, in Arizona!\nDOCTOR: It’s not unknown. But unheard of in July. Look towards the horizon, what do you see?\nCONSTANCE: That’s — that’s heat haze!\nDOCTOR: Now look up.\nCONSTANCE: Thick grey clouds, right above us.\nDOCTOR: Not us. The terraformer.\nCONSTANCE: That’s not a coincidence, is it?\nCONSTANCE: (FX: OFF, MULTIPLE CAR DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING. CARS PULLING AWAY, DRIVING OFF, THROUGH: )\nDOCTOR: There are no coincidences.\nCONSTANCE: Hello, what’s going on over there...?\nBRYCE: (WELL OFF) Guys, come back! Guys! Think of your contracts! Guys...!\nDOCTOR: Looks like Mr Bryce Foreman is having staff trouble. The question is: is everyone nipping home to pick up a woolly jumper... or do they know something we don’t?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. GEO-ENGINE CONTROL\nDA COSTA: (SHIVERING AND STAMPING FEET) Man alive, it’s cold out there! The morning starts out with an Arizona summer and the afternoon turns into a Wisconsin winter. No way that’s natural!\nMACHT: My thoughts exactly. Did you find anything, Major?\nDA COSTA: No, sir. I checked all the security logs, no unusual or suspicious activity.\nMACHT: Good. Now I want you to conduct interviews with the site staff and crew.\nDA COSTA: That’s.. gonna be hard.\nMACHT: What do you mean?\nZETTERLING: They’re leaving.\nMACHT: What?\nZETTERLING: Look out the window, Hugo. There’s a convoy. Everyone’s leaving.\nMACHT: They can’t just leave! — Major, get your guys to stop them!\nDA COSTA: My guys are leaving, too. (RELUCTANTLY) There’s been... talk.\nMACHT: What do you mean, talk?\nDA COSTA: Talk about levelling that mound. Lots of these men, they’ve got native American ancestors. Said it should have been left alone.\nMACHT: They’re saying — what, there’s a curse? Is that what you’re telling me?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 30\nDA COSTA: That’s why Bryce called me in, he knew there was trouble brewin’. Then, when it started to snow...\nMACHT: Morons! — This is what I was talking about. Don’t you see, it’s all part of their plan!\nZETTERLING: Whose plan?\nMACHT: The saboteurs’!\nZETTERLING: Hugo, you’re starting to sound even more paranoid than usual.\nMACHT: Then no doubt I need to see a Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: EXT. TERRAFORMER FACILITY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE TRUDGING THROUGH BLIZZARD. HOWLING ARCTIC WIND) [NB: VOICES RAISED OVER WIND THROUGHOUT ]\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, it’s getting worse! It’s a blizzard!\nDOCTOR: Well, now we know where the Artron energy went. It’s as I said, energy doesn’t disappear but it does change form!\nCONSTANCE: Into snow?\nDOCTOR: Something’s affected that geo-engine, it’s transforming the local climate! — I wonder: is this really an accident...?\nCONSTANCE: Come on! We’re going to freeze to death if we don’t get back to the TARDIS soon! — You do know the way, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Have faith, Constance!\nCONSTANCE: Faith? You couldn’t even find your own kitchen!\nDOCTOR: Uhm, I have a confession to make about that!\nCONSTANCE: I’m all ears. Frozen ears, but ears nonetheless!\nDOCTOR: I’ve never been able to find the kitchen... ever!\nCONSTANCE: What?!\nDOCTOR: Well, why go traipsing round all those endless corridors when the finest eating establishments in all of time and space are right outside the TARDIS doors?!\nCONSTANCE: So why did you want to cook for me? — Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I wanted to do something nice for you! It backfired!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 32\nCONSTANCE: Back in the old country, our governess would tell us never to use the word ‘nice’, but to find a more expressive alternative instead!\nDOCTOR: Quite right!\nCONSTANCE: But I like ‘nice’. It’s small and warm and friendly. Thank you for trying to do something nice for me, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: My pleasure! Or it would have been if things had worked out [otherwise—]\nCONSTANCE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: (URGENTLY) Shh! Something’s coming. — Get down, behind this digger!\nCONSTANCE: There’s something in the snowstorm.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’s coming closer...!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT.

How can they be gone?\nDA COSTA: (STEPPING IN) The bars on the window — they’ve been melted...!\nMACHT: (ANGRILY TO DA COSTA) Why did you leave them in here with something that could do that?\nDA COSTA: I didn’t! This is a food store, there’s nothing in here that could melt those bars.\nZETTERLING: There’s a stack of empty containers here... (FX: CLINKING GLASS BOTTLES & JARS) Pasta sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, lots of salt, sodas and pickles.\nDA COSTA: All that lot would give you is a serious heartburn!\nZETTERLING: Exactly. They all have a high acidic P.H. value. The Doctor’s used them to make some kind of corrosive paste.\nMACHT: Oh, come on now!\nZETTERLING: He’s gutted a microwave oven here. I guess that somehow he found a way to agitate the compound he’d spread on the bars.\nMACHT: What?!\nZETTERLING: That’s brilliant. That’s actually brilliant.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 34\nDA COSTA: I’m going out there to find them.\nMACHT: You’11 do no such thing.\nDA COSTA: They’1l freeze to death if I don’t.\nMACHT: Their choice.\nDA COSTA: Seriously, they’1ll die out there! (EXITS)\nMACHT: (CALLING AFTER) Major! Major Da Costa!\nZETTERLING: Let him go, Hugo. If we do nothing, we’ve as good as killed them. How’s that going to look on the news? Who’d be the bad guy then?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: EXT. TERRAFORMER FACILITY\nCONSTANCE: What is that?\nDOCTOR: I can’t see for the whiteout. But whatever it is.. it’s going. Quickly, now’s our chance!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, wait! We can’t just charge blindly into a blizzard.\nDOCTOR: We can’t just sit here and freeze!\nCONSTANCE: There’s some kind of structure, off to our right. A hut, I think!\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Well spotted, Constance!\nCONSTANCE: Come on.\nCONSTANCE: (FX: FOLLOW THEM AS THEY CRUNCH HEAVILY THROUGH SNOW, QUICK AS THEY CAN)\nCONSTANCE: What was that, back there?

DOCTOR & MACHT LOOKING AROUND )\nMACHT: What are we looking in Lisa’s lab for, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Data on your geo-engine would be useful, for one thing. If that storm-creature is drawing substance from it, there may be a way of disconnecting it from the source, or at the very least limiting its growth rate.\nMACHT: That’s one thing. And the other?\nDOCTOR: Hello, this plastic sheeting looks to be covering up a large, round object. I wonder what might lie beneath? Oh, I do so love a mystery.\nDOCTOR: Et voila!\nMACHT: What is that?\nDOCTOR: You don’t know? — Something the same size and shape as a Viking chieftain’s shield, recently disinterred from a mysterious burial mound.. I presume. Only this is no Viking shield, Dr Macht!\nMACHT: It isn’t?\nDOCTOR: No. It’s a piece of highly sophisticated extraterrestrial technology.\nMACHT: (SCEPTICAL) Extraterrestrial? As in alien?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’d appear that it’s been wired up to interface directly with your geo-engine’s primary computer system.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 59\nMACHT: The terraformer? — Wait a minute, do you think I’ve got something to do with this?\nDOCTOR: I daresay you thought you could reverse-engineer this device? It could be worth billions in new technologies. Tens of billions. Trillions!\nMACHT: (SURPRISED) Really?\nDOCTOR: (SARCASTIC) Don’t sound so surprised, “Doctor”.\nMACHT: Ah, the doctorate’s honorary. You can probably tell. I’m no scientist, but I am smart. I have a talent for predicting what people want before they even know it themselves. I’m what you’d call — well, a futurist!\nDOCTOR: Buzzword nonsense!\nMACHT: Don’t knock it. I can spot trends, movements and memes in their infancy. I know how to stay ahead of the curve. Where others see risk, I see opportunity.\nDOCTOR: Now, you sound like an advertising executive!\nMACHT: Funnily enough, that’s how I started out.\nDOCTOR: That doesn’t surprise me in the least. And you’ve still not convinced me that you had nothing to do with this!\nMACHT: I don’t even know what ‘that’ is. The way it all works is, I have an idea, then I bring in the best scientists, designers and engineers to make it happen. Ten years ago, I had the brainwave of combining trash recycling with 3D printers. Now we're building economic, ergonomic and environmentally friendly homes out of basically, garbage!\nDOCTOR: And the terraforming engine?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 60\nMACHT: What can I say? I’m trying to save the world. After all, it’s where my best customers live.\nDOCTOR: (SOFTENING) Dr Macht, I do believe I may have misjudged you.\nMACHT: Yeah, maybe you have. But while we’re on the subject of misjudging people: I want to know just what that “shield” is, and what Lisa Zetterling was doing with it?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER\nZETTERLING: A few weeks ago, I was running a preliminary geological survey for the phase six site development when I stumbled across this place. I used echo-sounding gear to find a way inside... and that’s when it got really interesting.\nCONSTANCE: You found the shield.\nZETTERLING: The disc isn’t a shield, it’s a machine. A piece of technology unlike anything I’ve ever seen, still operational after more than a thousand years. Goes without saying, it’s not of Earthly origin. — Wow. Mrs Clarke, I drop a bombshell like that and you don’t even blink!\nCONSTANCE: Go on.\nZETTERLING: I managed to establish an interface between the device and the main computer. The data coming through was extraordinary. Then Hugo... Dr Macht bought the phase six excavation up ahead of schedule and, well, the rest you know.\nCONSTANCE: So why didn’t you tell him what you’d found?\nZETTERLING: (AGITATED) It’s complicated.\nCONSTANCE: That won’t do.\nZETTERLING: It’s really complicated.\nCONSTANCE: I’ve noticed how you call him ‘Hugo’. He’s more to you than simply your employer, is he not?\nZETTERLING: (SIGHS) Once, yes, but not any more.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 62\nZETTERLING: Don’t be. My choice. He was relieved as I was, I think. He’s like a hummingbird, zipping from one idea to the next. He can’t settle.\nCONSTANCE: And you... want to settle?\nZETTERLING: What century did you come from?! — Actually, don’t answer that. (SIGHS) Look, Hugo’s got everything tied up in the terraformer project. Well, me too. I believe in it. I believe it’1ll be this planet’s salvation. Does that sound stupid?\nCONSTANCE: No, not at all.\nZETTERLING: He’s like a boy. If I’d handed him some shiny alien toy, he’d have been distracted. Plenty of people want this project to fail. Plenty of people want Hugo to fail. I won’t let that happen.\nCONSTANCE: So that’s why you kept the shield a secret.\nZETTERLING: I wanted to work out what it was first; that’s why I hooked it up to the mainframe, to analyse it properly. But if it turns out that disc, shield, whatever, really has affected the geo- engine... if it’s all my fault...\nCONSTANCE: Yes, well — cry over spilt milk all you like, but it seems to me you should have begun your analysis here.\nZETTERLING: What d’you mean, ‘here’?\nCONSTANCE: Right here. The fellows in this barrow may be so much dust and bone, but they still have a story to tell.. if one knows how to read it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. LABORATORY\nDOCTOR: (TINKERING WITH DISC) Pass me the screwdriver.\nMACHT: This one?\nDOCTOR: No, the other one.\nMACHT: This?\nDOCTOR: No! The other, ‘other’ one! — Out of my way. It’s quicker if I do it myself.\nDOCTOR: I miss the old days. When one size fitted all!\nMACHT: I told you, I’m not the handy sort.\nDOCTOR: Handy? I’ve known comatose molluscs with more technical ability. Now, hold the disc steady. This is the tricky part.\nMACHT: In what way? It’s not dangerous is it?\nDOCTOR: Danger is such an emotive term, I find. Let’s just say there’s an element of uncertainty at play here. This contraption was not built by human hands, but human-ish hands are presently trying to pry it open.\nMACHT: But Lisa got into it okay? To wire it up?\nDOCTOR: Yes, you will persist in referring to her by her forename, not her honorific. I’m no expert in these matters, but your acquaintance seems a little more familiar than just employer and employee...?\nMACHT: (SIGHS) Yeah, we had a connection, once. Not any more.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 64\nDOCTOR: What a pity.\nZETTERLING: My choice. She was relieved as I was, I think. It would’ve soured a great working relationship. I’m the dreamer, she’s the do-er. We made a good fit.\nDOCTOR: Made? Past tense?\nMACHT: Until she hid this thing from me! I don’t get it, it’s not like her. Can you get into it?\nDOCTOR: (STRAINING) The Professor made a start with the access ports and so on. However, those were the easy parts. (EXERTING HIMSELF) I find, as in life, the good stuff is always... harder to get at...!\nDOCTOR: Success!\nMACHT: (PAINED) What’s with the coloured lights?\nDOCTOR: That’s residual Artron energy. Ah, of course! When the Professor first powered up this disc, she must have accidentally triggered the pulse that brought my TARDIS here!\nMACHT: Whatever, it’s giving me a migraine!\nDOCTOR: That light wasn’t meant to be viewed by human eyes. Your faculties are only capable of perceiving a fraction of its wavelength.\nMACHT: If you say so.\nDOCTOR: Count yourself lucky. If you could see it all, your eyeballs would be running down your cheeks like soft boiled eggs. As it is, give it a minute and you’1l be right as rain.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 65\nMACHT: That’s a comfort. So, are you going to tell me what this thing is, exactly?\nDOCTOR: This, my dear Dr Macht, is a transmat booster. A kind of intergalactic bus stop. A way of travelling round the cosmos on the cheap.\nMACHT: A bus stop? Seriously?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely! I’m simplifying, but not everyone ventures into the heavens in enormous great starships. Others have been known to deploy unmanned drones kitted out with these — teleport relay base-stations.\nMACHT: (THINKING) Then these are like... what? Stepping stones? For teleporting between worlds?\nDOCTOR: Between solar systems, galaxies even. Imagine stepping on one here and getting off in say, Alpha Centauri. A pop down to the corner shop, galactically speaking. A very practical and cost effective way to travel.\nMACHT: Except when it goes wrong - right?\nDOCTOR: Very perceptive, Dr Macht. Yes, the disc would appear to have become damaged. Perhaps the drone that was transporting it got knocked off course, and it crashed on Earth?\nMACHT: What, in Viking times?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. Maybe our Viking friends found it and meddled with it somehow? Whichever way, where their journey should have been instantaneous, some poor soul was trapped inside the transmat matrix for a thousand years or more.\nMACHT: You mean, there’s something inside there? Something alive?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 66\nDOCTOR: I said ‘was’. It’s out now. The codified consciousness of a sentient being, trapped in the buffer of this device. Unable to see or hear or feel, but aware of every passing second of its confinement.\nMACHT: So when Lisa hooked it up to the main computer...\nDOCTOR: It had a way inside your geo-engine. There’s been a ghost in your terraforming machine, trying to find a way to build itself a new body. I imagine its home is somewhere cold, given its preference for ice and snow.\nMACHT: But why murder the Major, and Bryce?\nDOCTOR: Its snow form was merely a first step. I daresay it’s using their body matter to construct something closer to its own.\nMACHT: But it’s not done yet, is it?\nDOCTOR: I doubt that very much. It needs our flesh to reconstitute itself. And after more than a thousand years in limbo... it won’t be easily stopped.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER\nCONSTANCE: Let’s see about these mysterious runes, shall we? (READING) ‘To all of those who read my words, heed me [and —’]\nZETTERLING: You can really read that? The Vikings’ language?\nCONSTANCE: Apparently so. At first I could only glean snippets, but it’s become an awful lot clearer. I presume it takes time for the TARDIS to work its magic.\nZETTERLING: I don’t understand?\nCONSTANCE: It doesn’t matter. I may have to paraphrase a little, the author is prone to waffle. Are you sitting comfortably, Professor?\nZETTERLING: Not really.\nCONSTANCE: I’ll begin, all the same. ‘To all of those who read my words, heed me and beware:’\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: VIKING FLASHBACK\nHERGER: ‘To all of those who read my words, heed me and beware: I am Herger, son of Wulfrick, grandson of Rithel, last of the high chieftains of the North. My blood, breath and bones now stand watch in this alien soil, so that my people may be spared the evil we have borne here with us.’\nHERGER: ‘It was five winters past when the rider came to our village from Estvyk. Horse and mount both maddened with fear.’\nHERGER: (FX: HORSE SLOWS AS IT ENTERS VILLAGE — FRIGHTENING CHICKENS ETC)\nRIDER: (SHOUTING) Dead! Dead! All are dead! All dead!\nHERGER: Whoa! Whoa, there!\nHERGER: Steady now. Easy.\nRIDER: (BREATHLESS) My Lord Herger. Sire. Everyone in Estvyk is dead. All of them, slaughtered down to the last child. I was in the pasture, fetching in the herd, else I would have been amongst them!\nHERGER: Be calm, man. Find your breath and let your words come true, for I can make no sense of them.\nRIDER: A Jotunn, lord. A frost demon. As tall as a ship is long. I saw it as it vanished into the tree-line. It butchered them all like cattle. Not a beast that could breathe was left standing!\nHERGER: ‘So it was that I rallied my men to travel to Estvyk, to do battle with this demon.’\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 69\nHERGER: (SHOUTING) Mount up! Ride hard! Prepare for battle!\nHERGER: ‘But when we arrived.. there was no battle to be had. Estvyk was a ruin, its people stripped of their flesh. White bone in white snow, and no blood on either. Then we heard the beast in the mist, its wailing on the wind.’\nVIKINGS: (CONSTERNATION) Gods alive!/ What was that?!/ Merciful heavens! [ETC]\nHERGER: Steady yourselves! Look, here — this demon leaves a trail even an infant could follow, for it has no fear of us. That shall be its undoing!\nHERGER: ‘We spurred our horses forward, burning anger in our hearts. But when we came upon the demon — standing brazen in a clearing, waiting — the sight of it threatened to steal the courage of even the bravest of us.’\nHERGER: God's blood!\nHERGER: ‘It stood ten men tall and half as wide. Armoured in ice and\nHERGER: rimed in stolen flesh.’\nHERGER: (SHOUTING) Onwards! To the death! Bring it down!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THEY MEET. SOUNDS OF SLAUGHTER AND MAYHEM ENSUE — HORSES WHINNY IN FEAR, MEN SCREAM AS THEY’RE RIPPED APART. UNDER\nTHIS: )\nHERGER: ‘None could stand against it. It was as implacable as a mountain and as remorseless as the ocean.’\nHERGER: (SHOUTING) Stand your ground! Keep your nerve! Hold him, damn you! Hold him!!\nHERGER: ‘Stout heart, broad shield and keen blade availed us naught.\nHERGER: It used the very wind as a whip to pare the meat from the bones of men and beast alike, ‘til all we could do was turn and run.’\nHERGER: Back! Back! Pull back!!\nHERGER: ‘Village after village fell as it moved across the land, a Swathe of white death. No mortal means could bring it low, so in desperation I sought out the Volva, the oracle, the speaker of the dead.’\nORACLE: So, has the mighty chieftain met his match in the stormbringer? He wonders how can he defeat a foe who does not fear spear or sword? What is to be done, hm?\nHERGER: I consult one who is wiser than I. Tell me, how can I kill that which cannot be killed?\nORACLE: (CHUCKLES) The Jotun is a beast like any other. You shall know it by its spoor. What it leaves behind may choke it yet. Look to the bones, the bones of the sea for your weapon!\nHERGER: ‘And so it came to be. Where the beast had turned our weapons aside, the bones of the sea petrified its form, turning it to stone —‘\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 71\nHERGER: . and a stone may be broken — by a hammer!’\nHERGER: (FX: MIGHTY HAMMER SMASHING STONE — THE CREATURE BROKEN.

I admit, I’m not making much progress with a simple screwdriver. But I doubt a pick-axe will be any improvement!\nMACHT: My lab, my project, my call. I’m going to smash that thing to pieces and end all this!\nDOCTOR: And most likely end yourself in the process! Have you any idea of the energies contained in this device?\nMACHT: Uh...\nDOCTOR: I need this disc intact and connected to the computer. Hopefully, it’1ll help me communicate with whoever was trapped inside it.\nMACHT: Talk to it? What for? It’s a monster! It’s killed two people already.

LABORATORY\nMACHT: You really think you can use that disc to talk to that monster? Convince it not to kill anyone else?\nDOCTOR: Nanites from your geo-engine gave the creature form, but that form is unstable. My theory is, if I can adjust the flow of data from the disc to the geo-engine, the nanites themselves will help stabilise the creature; and hopefully give it back its self-control. Presuming it had any to start with, of course.\nMACHT: (NONPLUSSED) Okay. — But can you get it to work?\nDOCTOR: Not if you keep interrupting me, no!\nMACHT: Can I help, though?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, can you? — Look, if you want to be useful, go and keep watch.\nMACHT: (SLIGHTLY OFF) No sign of the creature through the window... (COMING BACK) That’s gotta be good, right?\nDOCTOR: Not really. It’s probably busy chasing after Mrs Clarke and Professor Zetterling.\nMACHT: How can you say that so matter-of-factly?!\nDOCTOR: Because it is a matter of fact. This facility has been evacuated. There’s no-one else present for the creature to focus its attention on, except them and us. The creature isn’t here, therefore —\nMACHT: Are you saying that they’re dead?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 77\nDOCTOR: If they were, the creature would no doubt be searching for us. Since it isn’t, most likely they’re still giving it the runaround.\nMACHT: You’ve got a cold heart, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Two, actually, and beating my breast will achieve little. Constance and the Professor are best served by my finishing my work. — Which... I believe I have done. Yes.\nMACHT: So what happens now?\nDOCTOR: We bring it here, for a nice little chat.\nMACHT: How?\nDOCTOR: By attracting its attention, of course. Sending it a signal.\nMACHT: What, like throwing a rock at a hornets’ nest?\nDOCTOR: Good heavens, no, Dr Macht.\nDOCTOR: It’ll be considerably worse!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT.

I hope it wasn’t nothing stupid or dangerous...\nCONSTANCE: Going by past experience, I’d say probably both.\nZETTERLING: Whatever, that thing knows where we are. We should go while we got the chance.\nCONSTANCE: Not yet. I want to read the rest of Chief Herger’s story first.\nZETTERLING: Seriously?!\nCONSTANCE: The Doctor would want us to.

What was it that let slip this doom upon the land?\nHERGER: The digging of a well. It seems the villagers had unearthed a wheel-shaped tabernacle of light. A cold light — blue, not red, that burned without heat. Countless flickering points, like sunlight on a frozen lake.\nORACLE: A gateway to Jotunheim! A portal to one of the nine realms!\nHERGER: They had taken it to the blacksmith. They sought to prise it open with hammer and tongs... and it proved to be their undoing.

Mr Bryce, I’m relieved to see you alive and er, reasonably well, [but]\nBRYCE: What, after you left me for dead?!\nMACHT: That wasn’t what happened, Bryce!\nDOCTOR: He’s right. Mr Bryce, we looked back into the warehouse but you’d gone. In the circumstances, it seemed almost certain that the creature had got you.\nBRYCE: Ah, it turned the tractor over with me inside.

That bout of unconsciousness, I’d suggest, is the thing that saved you. — That is a nasty gash on your forehead,\nDOCTOR: perhaps I could take a look?\nBRYCE: Get back! — See, when I was laying there bleeding in the dark, that’s when I worked it all out.\nMACHT: Worked all what out?\nBRYCE: Where is it now, your monster — Dr Macht?\nMACHT: My monster?\nBRYCE: Of course, your monster!

I won’t have guns here.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t this Arizona? I thought they gave them away with breakfast cereal.\nBRYCE: Shut up! Just shut up! (PAINED) I can’t... can’t think straight...\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 86\nDOCTOR: Mr Bryce, much as I admire your gusto, I feel I must point out that the not insignificant contusion on your forehead and its attendant blood loss may well have skewed your current worldview!\nBRYCE: (PUZZLED) What?\nBRYCE: (FX: CRUNCHING OF GLASS IN CORRIDOR BEYOND — THE MONSTER APPROACHING )\nMACHT: What the Doctor’s telling you, you moron, is you’re delirious!\nBRYCE: Delirious, am I? Delirious? I’1ll — I’1ll give you delirious, Dr Macht...!\nDOCTOR: Er, Mr Bryce — I strongly advise you walk this way. Quickly!\nMACHT: (REALISATION) It’s behind you, Bryce...!\nBRYCE: Is that the best you’ve got? You must think I was born yesterday!\nDOCTOR: Listen to us, I beg you! Bryce!!!\nBRYCE: Holy — (SCREAMS AS THE MONSTER FLATTENS HIM)\nMACHT: Quick, Doctor — while it’s distracted, let’s get out of here!\nDOCTOR: No! This may be the only chance we get to communicate with the creature. (FX: TYPING INTO COMPUTER KEYBOARD) I just need to realign the interface first...\nMACHT: This had better work, Doctor...!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 87\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING AT SNOW MONSTER) That’s quite enough of that, thank you very much!\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’re beginning to understand me now, aren’t you? Just listen, listen to me. I am not your enemy. I’m here to help.\nMACHT: I don’t think it cares!\nDOCTOR: But first, first what I need you to do is touch the disc. You remember the disc, don’t you? I’ve adjusted it, it’s now a two- way feed to the geo-engine. Nanites are now repairing the disc. So if you just touch the disc... you’1ll be repaired too. Do you follow?\nMACHT: Not sure I do.\nDOCTOR: Do be quiet, Dr Macht. (TO CREATURE) That’s right. Reach out. Touch the disc. There.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AT THE MOMENT OF CONTACT, THE DISC HUM SOFTENS. A SORT OF GLITTERY SOUND AS THE NANITES BEGIN TO REPAIR THE CREATURE)\nMACHT: It’s changing...!\nDOCTOR: Returning to something more like its natural form. — Hello? How’s that? Do you feel any better?\nTALESSH: (FX: STARTS OFF GROWLING WHICH GRADUALLY BECOMES MORE COHERENT BUT THROATY SPEECH) Who... who are you?\nDOCTOR: Funnily enough, I was about to ask you the very same thing!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: EXT. EXCAVATION SITE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BLIZZARD HAS DROPPED — JUST A LIGHT BREEZE. ZETTERLING & CONSTANCE CRUNCHING ACROSS DEEP SNOW)\nZETTERLING: At least it’s stopped snowing.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, the blizzard has eased, rather. I wonder why.\nZETTERLING: Still, it’s going to take us twice the time to get back, in these snowdrifts. (STOPPING, EXHAUSTED) Guess we didn’t think to dress for Arctic conditions this morning. Stupid, huh?!\nCONSTANCE: Best foot forward, Professor.\nZETTERLING: You just take it all in your stride, don’t you? Back there, in the barrow — I’ve never felt so close to death. I don’t know how you kept yourself together. Sure, ‘stiff upper lip’ and all that, but still..!\nCONSTANCE: I’ve known people go to war and never return. Or return to homes bombed out in the Blitz. You can weep and wail for all the good it’1ll do, or you can just — well, get on with it.\nZETTERLING: The Blitz? — The London Blitz?!\nCONSTANCE: (SHE LET THAT SLIP) Oh, I — I’m afraid so, yes.\nZETTERLING: Wow. You’ve either had some awesome work done on that face, or — my God, you really are, aren’t you?\nCONSTANCE: (IRRITATED) Really what?\nZETTERLING: Like the Doctor said. Travellers in time and space!\nCONSTANCE: Did you doubt it?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 89\nZETTERLING: I guess I didn’t think it was possible, but after today, my idea of possible’s jumped up a whole other level! That outfit of yours —\nCONSTANCE: My uniform, you mean?\nZETTERLING: I thought it was some kind of retro thing, but you really are from the nineteen-forties, right?\nCONSTANCE: Professor, we need to plough on!\nZETTERLING: I guess, however scary it gets, flying around in time and space — it’s not W.W. [double-u double-u] Two, right? It’s gotta be better than that!\nCONSTANCE: I’m not a deserter, I’1l have you know...!\nZETTERLING: Oh, hell. Sorry... again. I should get that made into a T-shirt, right?\nCONSTANCE: Already the past seems like a long time ago, but I could go back there tomorrow. And I fully intend to, incidentally! Except -\nZETTERLING: Maybe the day after tomorrow, huh? Or the day after that?\nCONSTANCE: There are certain things I have to do, when I go back. Personal matters to be dealt with.\nZETTERLING: Like, uh... Mr Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: I said, personal matters!\nZETTERLING: Hey, you wanted to know all about Hugo and me!\nCONSTANCE: That was different.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 90\nZETTERLING: Well, I don’t see how.\nCONSTANCE: Because... because I’m from the nineteen-forties, and I have an\nCONSTANCE: extremely stiff upper lip!\nZETTERLING: You got me there. Guess we’d better ‘plough on’, huh?\nCONSTANCE: We'd better!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT. LABORATORY\nTALESSH: Ts. Tes\nDOCTOR: Give it a second. There’s no rush. You haven’t spoken to anyone in a long time, but it’1ll come back to you.\nTALESSH: How... long... has it been?\nDOCTOR: I can’t say exactly, but the transmat disc has been here on Earth for one thousand years, at least. Why were you in there? What did you come here for?\nTALESSH: (FALTERINGLY) To explore. To study. To survey. I ama scientist. A planetary engineer.\nDOCTOR: Well, isn’t that a coincidence? You’re in the same line as Dr Macht! — Anything you’d like to ask our friend, Hugo?\nMACHT: (ANGRY) Only why did it kill those men? The Major, and Bryce?\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) Not now...\nMACHT: Yes, now! They died on my watch. I want to know what I’m supposed to tell their families!\nTALESSH: I could not... did not want to go back into the void.\nDOCTOR: Back into the transmat buffer, you mean?\nTALESSH: I had to find a way to stay. The cold was a beginning, but it was not enough. I needed more. I needed... to clothe myself.\nMACHT: So you murdered them for something to wear?!\nTALESSH: I.. did not think. I just wanted to be free. To return... home.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 92\nDOCTOR: And where might ‘home’ be, exactly?\nTALESSH: Ororah, the hollow star.\nDOCTOR: Oh, so you’re one of the Talessh. That explains a lot.\nMACHT: Not to me?\nDOCTOR: The Talessh were unique. A techno-psionic race. They could psychically interact with machine intelligences. Imagine thinking your instructions into a computer instead of typing them. That also explains how it could interact so easily with the terraformer’s mainframe.\nTALESSH: ‘Were’ unique. — Why... did you Say... ‘were’ unique?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I have some bad news. Your home world no longer exists. Its star collapsed in on itself round about a thousand years ago.\nMACHT: Tactful.\nDOCTOR: Do shut up, there’s a good fellow.\nTALESSH: (GROWING AGITATED) That... cannot be! My nest mate, my off- spring... dead!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nTALESSH: But that is why we came here! To save them! We came to save them all!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: EXT. TERRAFORMER FACILITY\nCONSTANCE: Stop. Professor, wait!\nZETTERLING: C’mon, we’re nearly there.\nCONSTANCE: Look, those must be the creature’s footprints. Where are they leading?\nZETTERLING: Uh.. R and D, I guess. My department. (REALISATION) That’s where the shield is!\nCONSTANCE: Wait. What do we do when we get there? What do we do if we run into the creature first? Throw snowballs at it?\nZETTERLING: What do you suggest?\nCONSTANCE: My Doctor may be averse to using weapons, but I’m not.\nZETTERLING: We can check the security station, but I doubt there’1l be any firearms there. Say what you like about Hugo, he does not like guns in any way, shape or form.\nCONSTANCE: From what we’ve seen, I don’t think firearms would do much good anyway. We need something more... substantial.\nZETTERLING: How’d you mean, ‘substantial’?\nCONSTANCE: (WALKING OFF) From the heavy plant store! — You’1ll see. Follow me!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. LABORATORY\nDOCTOR: I apologise for being the bearer of bad tidings, but there may well be Talessh colonies or outposts out there? I could help you find them, if you wish...?\nTALESSH: That will not restore my family!\nDOCTOR: Nonetheless, there’s hope to be found, if you look hard enough.\nMACHT: (QUIETLY TO DOCTOR) Why are you cosying up to that thing? For all you know, it’s completely insane.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY TO MACHT) Yes, that had occurred to me, Dr Macht. Which is why I chose not to articulate the thought in front of the huge, flesh-consuming ice alien?\nMACHT: (QUIETLY) Point taken.\nDOCTOR: (TO MONSTER) You know, we’re going about this completely the wrong way. We haven’t even been properly introduced. — How do\nDOCTOR: you do? I’m the Doctor; this is Dr Macht; and you are...?\nTALESSH: I was... I am... Elder Prime Technician Kazile Esta Horoki of the Tabernacle of Celestial Engineering.\nDOCTOR: See, we’re getting along swimmingly. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Elder Prime Technician. Tell me — what did you mean when you said you came here to “save” everyone?\nTALESSH: We came for the Sun.\nMACHT: The Sun? Our Sun? What, like a holiday?\nDOCTOR: (WARY) I suspect not.\nTALESSH: Our own star was becoming unstable. We required a replacement, but its variety was uncommon. We searched the galaxies. Yours was most compatible.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 95\nMACHT: You wanted to take our Sun and swap it for yours? Like... changing a light bulb?! Is that even possible?\nDOCTOR: The Talessh wouldn’t have come this far if they didn’t think so. Their home world is, was, the inside of a Dyson sphere. A whole solar system re-engineered into a huge hollow sphere, with the sun at its centre.\nTALESSH: The hollow star! The eye of the beholder!\nMACHT: Why? I don’t get it.\nDOCTOR: The inner surface was vast, allowing them to harvest their sun’s full potential.\nMACHT: Right. But I guess something went wrong?\nTALESSH: There were... solar flares. Lethal radiation. Our life-giver had turned toxic, so we were tasked to find another.\nMACHT: Steal another, you mean?!\nDOCTOR: Yes, but as we’ve established, that was all long in the past. As I said, Elder Prime Technician — there are undoubtedly Talessh colonies out there. I have a ship. I can reunite you with your people.\nTALESSH: (ICILY) Reunite me..? Doctor, I never left them. They are here with me, now.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. Oh, no, no, no...\nMACHT: That sounds like way too many ‘nos’ to be a good thing?\nDOCTOR: How many people did it take to build your geo-engine, Dr Macht?\nMACHT: I don’t know. Thousands, I guess.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 96\nDOCTOR: Now, how many do think it would take to dismantle a Sun?\nMACHT: Uh.\nTALESSH: Ours was a simple survey mission. We numbered no more than nine thousand.\nMACHT: Nine thousand?!\nDOCTOR: All queued up inside the disc behind the Prime Technician, like commuters packed onto a subway platform at rush hour. (GROAN) And I adjusted the interface so the nanites could repair the disc...!\nTALESSH: For which I thank you... Doctor! (FX: DISC HUM VARIES AS TALESSH MANIPULATES IT) Come, my team. Begin your mission.\nTALESSH: (FX: FROM FAR OFF, OUTSIDE — SOUNDS OF HEAVY TURBINES/ENGINES STARTING UP, BUILDING IN PITCH)\nMACHT: What the-? Those are the terraformer’s turbines! They’re ratcheting up to maximum capacity!\nDOCTOR: I told you, they’re good with machines.\nMACHT: But that’s impossible! They should take days to gear up to full speed!\nTALESSH: With nine thousand of my celestial engineers inside your technology, there is little we cannot do.\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: EXT. WAREHOUSE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: NOISE FROM TERRAFORMER CONTINUES, ONLY NOW HEARD FROM OUTSIDE, FURTHER AWAY. BUT THE SOUND IS MASKED BY THAT OF A DIGGER ENGINE THROATILY REVVING AS IT MOVES FORWARDS )\nCONSTANCE: (OPERATING DIGGER, LOUD) Yes, I do believe I’ve got the hang of this!\nZETTERLING: So, we’ve got a digger. What now?\nCONSTANCE: Now, we rescue the doctors.\nZETTERLING: Seriously?\nCONSTANCE: Seriously.\nZETTERLING: (DETECTING TERRAFORMER NOISE) Wait. — Wait...! Stop! Kill the engine!\nCONSTANCE: Why, do you want to drive?\nZETTERLING: Just kill it. (FX: CONSTANCE KILLS ENGINE) Listen. Do you hear that? That’s the phase five geo-engine! The terraformer’s on- line!\nCONSTANCE: Working, you mean? I thought it already was?\nZETTERLING: Not fully, no. We had six weeks to go before we became fully operational, but by the sound of it, it’s running at optimum capacity already. It should take days to cycle up like this!\nCONSTANCE: Perhaps it’s the Doctor? My Doctor?\nZETTERLING: Or something else? Look, above the terraformer!\nCONSTANCE: A whirlwind...?!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 98\nZETTERLING: A tornado!\nZETTERLING: (FX: A SECOND TORNADO MATERIALISES, SPINNING. AND ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER...)\nCONSTANCE: Not just one. I count three, four, five! Springing up out of thin air!\nZETTERLING: It’s the engine. It has potential for weather control but not like this...!\nZETTERLING: (FX: WIND INTENSIFIES — BECOMES A SCREAMING WAIL, THEN A CHORUS OF SAME; NEW TALESSH ROARING)\nCONSTANCE: What on Earth?\nZETTERLING: Inside the whirlwinds! Can you see? There — those shapes,\nZETTERLING: shadows. They look like..bodies forming?\nCONSTANCE: Very large bodies!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. LABORATORY\nMACHT: They’re making whirlwinds!\nDOCTOR: No, they’re not...!\nTALESSH: My engineers no longer need to steal your flesh to give themselves form.\nDOCTOR: . they’re weaving new bodies from the elements themselves!\nTALESSH: Welcome — to the new ice age!\nTALESSH: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 100"

Well, you certainly know how to make an entrance!\nZETTERLING: Where’s Hugo? — Hugo!!\nMACHT: (COUGHING) Over here!\nZETTERLING: (GOING OVER) Are you okay?\nMACHT: (HELPED UP) I’m having a ball, thanks for asking! Sure beats a quiet round of golf!\nZETTERLING: Yeah, like sarcasm’s appropriate.\nMACHT: Lisa, I’m fine. Thanks for asking. I think if anything had happened to me, you’d be the only one who cared.\nZETTERLING: Me and several hundred shareholders!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 105\nMACHT: Don’t spoil the moment.\nZETTERLING: We were having a moment?\nDOCTOR: Flirt in your own time, we’re busy!\nTALESSH: (RAGGED WITH STATIC) Doctor...

Come on!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DISCONNECTING HUMMING DISC) Just a moment! I’m not going anywhere without this.\nCONSTANCE: The shield, of course!\nDOCTOR: Transmat booster, actually.\nTALESSH: (STILL STRUGGLING) Leave that device!

We should be safe in here for now.\nDOCTOR: Good. (HEFTING DISC) Dr Macht, would you mind relieving me of this transmat booster for a moment?\nMACHT: Uh, OK — (TAKING WEIGHT) Man, this thing’s heavy!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’d noticed.\nZETTERLING: Doctor, we saw more of those creatures forming outside, gestating inside tornados. Half a dozen, I think.\nDOCTOR: With many more to come I fear.\nCONSTANCE: If they’re using this... machine to build themselves, can’t we Simply pull the plug?\nMACHT: This thing doesn’t have an on/off switch, you know.\nZETTERLING: It’s taken two months to cycle up to this point. Cut the power now and it could induce a catastrophic overload. We’d blow up them, us, the terraformer and most likely half the state.\nCONSTANCE: There may be another way to stop them.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 108\nCONSTANCE: While the Professor and I were trapped in the barrow, I had time to read the Vikings’ inscription. They thought the shield — disc, whatever — they thought it was a gateway to somewhere called ‘Jotunheim’ ?\nDOCTOR: Jotunheim? One of the nine worlds in Norse mythology, as I recall. Where the rock and frost giants were said to reside. Not a real place, I’m afraid.\nCONSTANCE: The point is, they met a ‘frost giant’ too. But they were able to kill at.\nMACHT: What, Vikings? Big guys with beards and hats with cow horns got the best of that nightmare?\nDOCTOR: Not the same Talessh, surely? Doubtless it was just the first in the queue, ahead of the Prime Technician.\nMACHT: (SNARKY) ‘Doubtless’.\nCONSTANCE: The inscription said that they used the ‘bones of the sea’ to turn the Jotunn, the frost giant, to stone.\nMACHT: Bones of the sea? What does that even mean?\nDOCTOR: The simplest explanation is often the most obvious. Bones of the sea — sea shells.\nZETTERLING: What’s so special about sea shells?\nDOCTOR: Well, what are sea shells made of?\nMACHT: Uhh... calcium?\nDOCTOR: Calcium, precisely! And in some species, an excess of calcium can cause rampant ossification!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 109\nZETTERLING: The accelerated laying down of new bone matter?\nDOCTOR: So to the Vikings it would look as if their Jotunn had turned to stone! Of course...!\nMACHT: Gotta love that ‘of course’.\nCONSTANCE: Do be quiet, doctor. — Not you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: As I was saying... it way well be that the Talessh evolved from some water-borne species, since calcium carbonate is highly toxic to certain aquatic lifeforms. That must be why the Prime Technician rejected its victim’s skeletons while it was rebuilding itself. The Vikings, you see, weren’t simply ‘big guys with beards and hats with cow horns...’\nMACHT: Hey, blame Kirk Douglas, not me.\nDOCTOR: . they were farmers, too, who used ground sea shells and bone meal as fertiliser.\nCONSTANCE: So they, what? Cast the powder into the creature, who couldn’t process it — and died?\nDOCTOR: (PUT OUT) Or so I presume.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry, did I steal your thunder?\nMACHT: Only trouble is, I’m all out of sea shells. Must have left them at home!\nZETTERLING: Look at where we are, Hugo. We don’t need them. We can make them!\nDOCTOR: All we need is a sample, and the geo-engine can do the rest. It’s already created a snow storm, manufacturing a mass of calcium molecules should be a doddle!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 110\nMACHT: Well, where are we gonna find a bone sample?\nCONSTANCE: Major Da Costa’s skeleton is still out there...\nDOCTOR: Buried three feet deep in snow, I suspect. We don’t have time to search for it. — No, I can think of somewhere else we can\nDOCTOR: lay on our hands on a suitable sample, but...\nZETTERLING: What’s the catch?\nDOCTOR: It’ll mean running the gauntlet of the Talessh, so I’m going to need two of you to act as decoys, I’m afraid. Any volunteers?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: EXT. TERRAFORMER FACILITY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: LARGE OPEN AREA. THE FIRST TALESSH IS A FLESH HYBRID.

I’m thinking I might try something out.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Like what?\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 112\nZETTERLING: (SOTTO) Like a chemistry experiment.

By your own admission you’re stinking rich and probably want for nothing. I imagine you’ve never even worn the same pair of socks twice?\nMACHT: Is this going anywhere?\nDOCTOR: I was about to say that a little suffering is good for the soul. Your should relish the opportunity!\nMACHT: So how good’s your soul, Doc’? Seen much suffering?\nDOCTOR: (SOMBRE) More than you can possibly imagine.\nMACHT: Seriously, though, can’t you take it for a bit? The wind’s picking up again. I’m starting to lose the feeling in my fingers here!\nDOCTOR: It’s not the wind, it’s them. They’re looking for us. They want what’s in that disc. They may even be able to sense their compatriots inside it somehow?\nMACHT: Still, can’t you carry it? Just for a bit?\nDOCTOR: No, because I have to find the entrance to the barrow.

That’s it?\nDOCTOR: (OPENING TARDIS DOOR) My TARDIS is not a ‘closet’.

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nMACHT: Ah, OK. It’s a little bit bigger inside, I’1ll give you that.\nDOCTOR: ‘A little’?\nMACHT: Kinda Eighties nostalgia, though. I hate that stuff. I was born too late, and I can’t say I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: This is a type forty TARDIS!

It’s that whole “laughing in the face of adversity” thing?\nDOCTOR: I’m glad you our situation so amusing. Just to add to your hilarity, you can go and fetch me those bone samples. Just a finger from each, I doubt our friends will mind.\nMACHT: (PATHETIC) Can’t you do it?\nDOCTOR: Someone has to hook the transmat booster up to the TARDIS console. Can you do that? No.\nMACHT: But the storm? You said those things were on the way?\nDOCTOR: Well, then — you’d better hope that the Professor and Mrs Clarke have got your back, hadn’t you? — Go on, shoo!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: EXT.

What did you call it again?\nZETTERLING: Napalm. It’s a gelling agent combined with a combustible accelerant. A hold-over from one of the nastier wars of the late twentieth century.\nCONSTANCE: Wars. How many more have there been since—? No, don’t answer that. It’s too depressing.\nZETTERLING: We can’t kill them, we know that. But these new Ice Talessh must be vulnerable to light and heat.

However, I suspect our part may need to undergo some revision.\nMACHT: Why, what’s wrong? I got the fingers you asked for?\nDOCTOR: Yes, only it appears I’ve found our Viking friends’ souls.\nMACHT: You what?\nDOCTOR: Watch the scanner.\nDOCTOR: You see, I’ve discovered that there’s more than the Talessh bio-patterns stored in the transmat buffer. In an emergency, its default setting is to save and store all bio-matter templates in the vicinity. Be they Talessh... or otherwise.\nMACHT: Are you saying what I think you’re saying...?\nDOCTOR: The Vikings from the tomb. Because they died in close proximity to the transmat disc, it copied and saved them to its hard drive. So if I search the drive for human brain patterns...\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 119\nHERGER: (DISTORTED, OVER SCANNER) What place is this?\nMACHT: That’s impossible!\nDOCTOR: And yet here he is.

But they were defeated — not by a modern, technologically advanced race, no; but by relative primitives, wrapped in animal skins.\nTALESSH: You lie!\nCONSTANCE: No, he’s telling the truth.

To battle!\nHERGER: 6 x VIKINGS:\nTALESSH: No, no!!\nDOCTOR: With me, Mrs Clarke! — It wouldn’t do to get trodden on by a ten-foot-tall Viking, and it’s not every day one gets to say that!\nCONSTANCE: Only you could do something like this. Only you!\nDOCTOR: I wish I hadn’t had to.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS THE TWO ARMIES MEET AND CLASH — EXPLOSIVE ICE CRACKING SOUNDS AS THE ICE TALESSH SHATTER. FIRST ONE, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER...! )\nTALESSH: Fall back, brothers, sisters! Fall back, before we are all returned to dust!\nHERGER: (REACHING OUT) Back to Jotunheim, you horror! Plague this world\nHERGER: no more!\nTALESSH: (CALCIFYING AT HERGER’S TOUCH) No. No! Noooo000000000000000...!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 132\nCONSTANCE: The sky’s clearing. The sun’s coming out!\nHERGER: Thanks you Doctor, for giving us the chance to face our foe on equal terms but now, release us if you can. Valhalla calls us home.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That could be a little difficult, I’m afraid.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: The thing is, they were stored inside the transmat disc, there\nHERGER: What, this? The shield of the Jotunn...!\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure how to put the genie back inside the bottle, so to speak.\nCONSTANCE: You can’t just leave a bunch of twenty-foot-tall Vikings to stomp around America!\nDOCTOR: We-el1l...\nHERGER: Surely, then, if this shield is no more, then we will be no more...?\nDOCTOR: That’s true enough. But then nine thousand Talessh would be trapped in limbo too.\nCONSTANCE: You’re going to take the disc and go in search of the rest of the Talessh, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke, it’s all I can do.\nHERGER: All you can do, maybe. But I — I am a Titan now! And I may then crush it underfoot! Destroy this thing, as I would had I been able to before!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 133\nDOCTOR: (HORROR) Herger, no...!\nDOCTOR: (FX: TOO LATE — HERGER STAMPS ON THE DISC! WHOMPF! IT DISINTEGRATES )\nHERGER: To Asgard...!\nHERGER: (FX: WHOMPF! HERGER AND 6 x VIKINGS, ALL DISINTEGRATE IN RAPID SUCCESSION)\nCONSTANCE: They’re gone. Gone to dust...!\nDOCTOR: Along with the disc. Leaving nine thousand Talessh souls stuck somewhere between hell and Earth, for all eternity. — That\nDOCTOR: idiot Viking!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: INT. GEO-ENGINE CONTROL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. 4 x PAIRS OF FEET WALKING TO STOP, OUTSIDE TARDIS)\nZETTERLING: Okay, so we’ve cycled down the geo-engine. Guess the next major test is going to have to be delayed, for a while.\nDOCTOR: I don’t see why it should.\nMACHT: This was only phase five. The phase six terraformer, the advanced model, that’s gonna be twice the size. Only, uh, I guess we’re gonna need another site.\nCONSTANCE: Away from the Vikings’ burial mound, I trust?\nMACHT: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: Well, Dr Macht, Professor Zetterling — I can see you’ve got this whole ‘saving the world’ thing sewn up, so I think it’s time Mrs Clarke and I were gone, don’t you...?\nZETTERLING: In your ‘TARDIS’, huh? I still have trouble believing in it.\nCONSTANCE: Sometimes, so do I.\nMACHT: You know, Doctor, about the whole saving the world thing — I can’t help thinking maybe you’re the guy for the job of project manager, here at Burnt Oak...?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so.\nMACHT: C’mon, I can put together a fantastic package for you. A serious salary. A serious car. Share options...!\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: SNOWBLIND by Ian Edginton (003) Page 135\nCONSTANCE: Professor Zetterling, I rather think that someone here is trying to avoid their own responsibilities.\nZETTERLING: I think so too. — You, Hugo, you are going to see this thing through. Because I’m going to make you!\nDOCTOR: Don’t look so downhearted, Dr Macht. A great reward awaits you, greater than any I’1ll ever enjoy.\nMACHT: Yeah? What’s that?\nDOCTOR: To save a world, then to live in the world you've saved. Wouldn’t you agree, Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, Doctor. I would.\nDOCTOR: In you go, Constance. (SHE GOES; HE BEGINS TO CLOSE DOOR — THEN, CASUALLY) Oh, and, Hugo —\nMACHT: Yeah?\nDOCTOR: If this planet isn’t much improved the next time I visit this\nDOCTOR: time zone — I’1l be coming to get you...!\nDOCTOR: THE END"
