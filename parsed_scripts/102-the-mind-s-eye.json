What were you saying?\nALLY: I was telling you about my hot date. You weren't paying a blind bit of notice. Some best friend you are.\nPERI: Oh, sorry, Ally, I was miles away.\nALLY: Yeah, I noticed. I ate half your cookie right in front of you and you didn't bat an eyelid. I ask you, where's the fun in thett if it's so easy?\nPERI: I didn't mean to be rude. I'll turn this off. Go on, then. Spill the beans. What was Mister Wonderful like? Tell all.\nALLY: That's just it. There's nothing to tell. He never showed up.\nPERI: Oh, Ally, not again.\nALLY: That's the fourth this year. Still, I suppose not every girl can be as lucky as you.\nPERI: (laughs) Lucky?\nALLY: Mmm. Now, let's see. Nice house, a gorgeous boyfriend, a loving son...\nPERI: Well, two out of three ain't bad.\nALLY: Oh. Are you and Kyle still having difficulties?\nPERI: If by difficulties you mean door slamming, bad language and throwing things at me, then the answer's yes. In Kyle's eyes, I'm the wicked stepmother.\nALLY: I thought Mike and he had talked.\nPERI: You know Mike. He may be a hard-hitter at work, but with his son, he's a pussycat. When it comes to discipline in this house, I'm the one who wears the trousers. And Kyle doesn't like that. As Mike puts it, Kyle has a problem with authority.\nPERI: Which reminds me. I'd better be going. Kyle's headmaster wants to see me.\nALLY: Couldn't Mike go?\nPERI: Apparently, it's a mom thing. You can stay here and watch TV if you like.

I do not recollect...\nANDREE: You asked me to inform you when First Minister Malarou arrived, ma'am. Well, he is here.\nERIMEM: Ah. Yes, I recall now. Thank you, Andree. Kindly show him in, then leave us. And take the guards with you. They can wait outside.\nANDREE: As you command.\nMALAROU: My Queen. I came as quickly as I could.\nERIMEM: Malarou, what news? How fare my people?\nMALAROU: Worse and worse. There are riots in many sectors, your Highness. Massive damage to property.\nERIMEM: And casualties?\nMALAROU: Numerous. But no deaths reported so far, thank the gods.\nERIMEM: Yes. And no thanks to that traitor Kharto. I still find it hard to accept that this is all one man's doing. Are you sure your information is correct?\nMALAROU: As to whether Kharto is actually organising the rebels, I cannot say. But these riots are certainly inspired by him and his seditious speeches.\nERIMEM: Very well. Keep me informed, Malarou. I must speak with my Generals. I can stay my hand no longer. New Cairo was built on the bones of my ancestors and made fruitful by their blood. I will not stand by and watch it descend into chaos.\nPERI: Don't worry, Headmaster, I can assure you he'll be as good as gold from now on.\nPERI: You, follow me.

This is the third time this month I've been called by the Headmaster's secretary.\nKYLE: So?\nPERI: So, this is the best goddamn school in London. And unless you're whiter than white from now on you're gonna get kicked out of it. And that won't please your father very much, will it? He works his butt off earning enough money to send you here, and this is how you repay him? By starting a classroom brawl?\nKYLE: If he's so concerned about me, how come it's just you that turns out to bail me out?\nPERI: Your dad's busy. He's got commitments, meetings...\nKYLE: People to see, places to go. I've heard it all before.\nPERI: It doesn't mean your father isn't interested in what you do. Look, Kyle, I... I know it's hard for you, your dad having a new girlfriend, but I'm a part of Mike's life now, and yours. Can't we try to get along?\nKYLE: You really think you're going to be with him forever?

Play.\nHAYTON: [OC] Still unsure as to the precise nature of the samplified but initial test...\nHAYTON: Stop. Fast forward five minutes, then play.\nHAYTON: [OC] Time alone will tell. My experiments continue tomorrow. Science Officer Hayton signing off.\nHAYTON: Stop. Record. Log continues. The latest samples of bio-tissue have all demonstrated potential, but none survived long enough under lab conditions to evaluate them fully. Further living samples will be required to...\nTAKOL: Professor, we have to talk.\nHAYTON: End recording. Don't you ever knock, Major?\nTAKOL: Not in my own base, no. Any progress? High Command expects results, and I'd like to give them something sooner rather than later.\nHAYTON: Wouldn't you prefer to give them something finished rather than incomplete?\nTAKOL: Finished? Then you're getting close?\nHAYTON: I am, but I need more samples. Where's Ukarme got to?\nTAKOL: He's bringing in some stranger he shot. Apparently the man was babbling something about a doctor.\nHAYTON: A doctor, eh? Intriguing. Who do you think he is, Major? Military or mercenary?\nTAKOL: We'll soon find out. Come, I need you to bring him round.\nANDREE: Lunch, your Highness?\nERIMEM: Thank you, Andree. I asked First Minister Malarou to join me but he appears to be otherwise engaged. Have his meal sent to him wherever he is.\nANDREE: As you command.\nMALAROU: (approaching) My Queen?\nERIMEM: (laughs) Wait, Andree. It seems I am to be graced with his presence after all. Set his food down.\nANDREE: Your Highness.\nMALAROU: My Queen. Forgive this lamentable tardiness. I was deep in discussion with one of my aides on the... the matter we were conversing upon this morning.\nERIMEM: Kharto, you mean?\nMALAROU: Your Highness, perhaps we'd better discuss this another time somewhere more... private?\nERIMEM: Thank you, Andree. You may leave us.\nANDREE: My Queen.\nERIMEM: Really, Malarou. Andree has been my faithful servant for years.\nMALAROU: Nevertheless, one cannot be too careful.\nERIMEM: You see plots and treachery everywhere. Now, let's eat while you tell me your news. Mmm, this looks delicious.\nMALAROU: My Queen, wait. The food taster, please.\nERIMEM: Malarou, your concern for my health is touching, but I flatter myself I Know Kharto. He's a troublemaker, not a killer.\nMALAROU: Just let the food taster do his job, my Queen.\nERIMEM: Oh, very well. But do it quickly. I should like to eat my lunch while it's still vaguely hot. (claps hands.) Food tasters. I know we should respect our cultural traditions, but this is the twenty fifth century. I doubt anyone has been poisoned since the time of the Pharaohs.\nMALAROU: And that is precisely why someone like Kharto might try it now. To surprise us.\nERIMEM: I think you overestimate his cunning. He's the...\nERIMEM: Malarou, do something. He's dying!\nMALAROU: Guards! Guards! Fetch the medi-kit, quickly.\nHAYTON: Med-scan complete.\nTAKOL: Well, Hayton? How is he?\nHAYTON: Respiration normal. Pulse rate elevated but within acceptable limits. Well, well. Two hearts.\nTAKOL: Two hearts? A cybernetic?\nHAYTON: No, no, no. He may not be human, but he is humanoid. Alien, I'd say. It may perhaps explain how he survived so long outside without an environment suit.\nTAKOL: Can you bring him round?\nHAYTON: With the right equipment, the right funding and enough time, I can do pretty much anything.\nTAKOL: (sighs) Here we go again. The ego has landed.\nHAYTON: Oh, I know soldiers like to keep things simple. Ready, aim, fire. But science is a little more sophisticated.\nTAKOL: You know, you're not the only expert in your field. Maybe I should get myself a new genius.\nHAYTON: If you're thinking of Harvard Steel, forget it. He's out in the Zenori System on a long-term bio- energy project. Besides, his methods are questionable to say the least.\nTAKOL: Maybe, but he gets results.\nHAYTON: Listen Major, if I was allowed to conduct this research along the outlined...\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry. Would you mind lowering your voices?\nTAKOL: Oh. It seems your patient has recovered without further intervention from you.\nDOCTOR: I don't suppose there's any chance of a cup of tea? Stun guns always leave a dry taste in my mouth.\nTAKOL: We're fresh out of Darjeeling. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Pity. Well then, I wonder if you'd mind answering a few questions.\nTAKOL: When you've answered mine. First off, who are you and where did you come from?\nDOCTOR: There's a happy coincidence. Those are two of my questions too, along with where am I?\nTAKOL: You don't know where you are?\nDOCTOR: I seem to be having some problems with my memory.\nHAYTON: Hardly surprising. I'm frankly amazed you have any memory at all. Any longer out there in that jungle, and it would have been destroyed for good.\nTAKOL: Hayton.\nDOCTOR: Really? I'm the Doctor, by the way.\nHAYTON: Professor Darius Hayton at your service, and this is...\nTAKOL: I am Major Takol of the Earth Empire Space Marines, Commander of this mission. Assuming the caves where we found you were only a temporary address, where exactly are you from, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, here and there. I'm a traveller. At least, I think so. I journey with... Peri and Erimem. Please, Major, my travelling companions, two young ladies, they must be out there in the jungle.\nHAYTON: If they stayed in the caves there may be a chance. Major?\nTAKOL: Of course. I'll dispatch Ukarme right away.\nDOCTOR: Ukarme?\nHAYTON: The soldier who shot you.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I hope he's as fast on his feet as he is with his gun.\nERIMEM: Enter.\nMALAROU: You summoned me, your Highness?\nERIMEM: Yes, Malarou. Have you found the people responsible for the attempt on my life?\nMALAROU: We have made a number of arrests. Forensic tests are being conducted now.\nERIMEM: I want to be told as soon as the results are in.\nMALAROU: Of course, my Queen. I, er...\nERIMEM: Is there something else?\nMALAROU: Er, Kharto.\nERIMEM: What of him?\nMALAROU: He was staying at one of the houses that we raided. We couldn't ignore his presence at what was Clearly a base of rebel activities, so we, er, arrested him.\nERIMEM: Was that wise? His arrest could be the spark the insurgents need.\nMALAROU: As I said, we couldn't very easily arrest the others and let Kharto go free, now, could we?\nERIMEM: That is precisely what you should have done. His supporters would have wondered why he had been spared. They would have suspected him of having done a deal with us, selling them out in order to save his own miserable skin. It might not be too late. Fetch Kharto to me. I need to speak to him face to face.\nMALAROU: My Queen, I strongly advise against taking such a...\nERIMEM: Make the arrangements.\nMALAROU: As you command.\nERIMEM: One thing I learned from my old friend the Doctor. Never miss an opportunity to look your opponent in the eyes.\nMALAROU: The Doctor again. Is there no end to his genius. It seems he has a pearl of wisdom for every occasion.\nERIMEM: Do not joke about the Doctor. He was... is a very good friend.\nMALAROU: I did not mean to mock. But if he is such a good friend to you, why did he leave you?\nERIMEM: He didn't. I left him. I think.\nTAKOL: You think, Hayton? I need some certainty here. Is this Doctor telling the truth?\nHAYTON: Well, he appears to be. He had no idea where he was. Think about it, Takol. If he knew anything about this planet he wouldn't have been out in the jungle unprotected, would he?\nTAKOL: It might have been a ploy, a ruse to allay suspicion and gain entry to this base.\nHAYTON: Not everyone has a twisted mind like yours. He'd have to be a fool or a madman to take a risk like that.\nTAKOL: You said he was an alien. Perhaps he has a means to survive out there.\nHAYTON: Perhaps I should cut him up and find out how he ticks.\nTAKOL: Perhaps.\nHAYTON: I was joking.\nTAKOL: I wasn't. I don't trust him. If he finds out about what's going on here...\nDOCTOR: Ah! There you are. (door closes) I thought I heard voices.\nTAKOL: You recovered quickly.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I've got pretty good recuperative powers for a man of my age. Any news on my companions?\nTAKOL: Nothing yet. Ukarme is still searching for them. We'll let you know the moment we hear anything.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. This is a very impressive base, Major. I'd love to take a look around.\nTAKOL: I bet you would.\nHAYTON: Oh, I'd be only too happy to give you the grand tour. With your permission, Major, naturally.\nTAKOL: Granted.\nDOCTOR: Most kind. I hope I'm not putting you out.\nHAYTON: Not at all. This way, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What did you say this planet was called?\nHAYTON: Oh, it doesn't have a name. It's just listed as YT45.\nDOCTOR: So what brings a combined military and scientific mission to planet YT45?\nHAYTON: You ask a lot of questions, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I find it helps get answers.\nTAKOL: Remember, Doctor, curiosity killed the cat.\nERIMEM: Andree, if you must stay with me, kindly stand still.\nANDREE: I'm sorry, my Queen, but I fear for your safety. Kharto would kill you given the chance.\nERIMEM: A chance he will be denied, Andree. I am well-guarded as you can see. But I am touched by your concern. Thank you.\nANDREE: I have served you all my life, my Queen, ever since I could first walk.\nERIMEM: You have indeed been a faithful companion, Andree, one in whom I have... Wait a minute. That cannot be right.\nANDREE: Your Highness?\nERIMEM: You can't have served me since you were a child. That would be, what, twenty years ago.\nANDREE: You've ruled New Cairo since the colony was founded over twenty five years ago.\nERIMEM: That's not possible.\nHAYTON: Ta-da! The highlight of the tour - my laboratory.\nDOCTOR: Very impressive.\nHAYTON: You're too kind, Doctor. Like the rest of the base, it's just stock pre-fab. But I've tried to personalise it with my own clutter.\nDOCTOR: It looks a little less temporary than the other units.\nHAYTON: Ah well, that's the military mind-set for you. In and out quick as you can then onto the next mission...\nDOCTOR: So what exactly is the mission this time?\nHAYTON: Top secret, I'm afraid.\nDOCTOR: And who's this fellow? A native?\nHAYTON: Indeed. This planet's answer to a primate. We call them Jekylls.\nDOCTOR: Jekylls?\nHAYTON: Let's just say they have a split personality.\nDOCTOR: Well, this one seems friendly enough. Looks as bit like an oversized lemur, don't you.\nHAYTON: Oh, he is friendly, by day. But come nightfall it's a different matter. Observe those incisors, Doctor. Lethal. And he's strong too. Oh, he could rend you limb from limb if he had a mind to.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. But he's not your main interest here, is he?\nHAYTON: What makes you say that?\nDOCTOR: All these plants. I suspect you of being a closet botanist.\nHAYTON: Ah! My secret is out.\nDOCTOR: Now, let's see. A Methuselan poppy, Gavinci's strangle-weed. Very nasty. And this is... Kemsel moss?\nHAYTON: I'm impressed. It's a pleasure to meet a fellow aficionado.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Peri's the expert. I'm merely an enthusiastic amateur. Peri. Wait, I remember now. Peri and I were looking at some flowers. Purple ones like on the plants in this terrarium.\nHAYTON: Kyropites.\nDOCTOR: Kyropites? Is that what they're called? I've never seen anything like them before.\nHAYTON: No one has.\nDOCTOR: They're the real reason you're here, aren't they?\nHAYTON: What makes you think that?\nDOCTOR: Interesting. You're not denying it. Now, I wonder. Could there be some kind of connection between these plants and what happened to me out in the jungle? My memory loss?\nHAYTON: That's quite a leap, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But you don't sound very surprised by it. So not a leap in the dark, then.\nHAYTON: The kyropites do seem to have an unpleasant effect on people. And on the Jekylls too.\nDOCTOR: Memory loss?\nHAYTON: That's part of it, yes. If you'd been out there much longer it would have been far worse.\nDOCTOR: As in fatal?\nHAYTON: I'm afraid so. A routine survey mission landed here six months ago. At first all their data was being fast-beamed home, everything normal, and then... nothing.\nDOCTOR: The survey team started dying?\nHAYTON: Every last one of them.\nDOCTOR: And yet despite the danger, Major Takol wanted to lead a second mission here.\nHAYTON: The military believe that these plants may have potential.\nDOCTOR: As a weapon, you mean? Why? What's so special about these kyropites?\nHAYTON: I'll show you. Now, observe what happens when I introduce some foreign matter, in this case Heager Worms, to the kyropites in this terrarium. Don't worry, it's sealed.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. Some kind of anaesthetic gas?\nHAYTON: Precisely. Oh, don't worry. The worms will make a full recovery, I guarantee it.\nDOCTOR: But why anaesthetise your attacker? Why not simply kill him?\nHAYTON: They need him alive. They're neurological parasites. They feed telepathically on alpha waves, usually from the local wildlife. They wouldn't get much from these little chaps, of course, but with more advanced species the results can be spectacular.\nDOCTOR: The Jekylls, you mean?\nHAYTON: It appears they've developed some kind of symbiotic relationship. Far from pacifying the Jekylls, it makes them killers. Friendly by day, deadly at night.\nDOCTOR: But why? What purpose would that serve?\nHAYTON: It offers protection to the plants. Some creatures are more resistant to the anaesthetic gas than others. The Jekylls make sure that they are removed from the evolutionary tree.\nDOCTOR: Unnatural selection.\nHAYTON: Whatever you call it, that's what happened to the original survey team. And not just them. We landed here during the planet's night cycle, and lost three of our men the same way.\nDOCTOR: Horrible. So those the Jekylls leave alive, the plants send into some kind of coma.\nHAYTON: Not a coma exactly. It's more like a deep sleep. The victims are dreaming the whole time, producing plenty of alpha waves to feed the plants. And another thing. It's as if the plants share the dream experience.\nDOCTOR: But that's incredible.\nHAYTON: Nevertheless, that is what appears to be happening. What did you experience?\nDOCTOR: I don't think I succumbed to actual sleep, but I did feel something, a presence in my head.\nHAYTON: Do you have any history of telepathy?\nDOCTOR: A little.\nHAYTON: It's possible that made you less susceptible.\nDOCTOR: There's something very odd about al this. Something that doesn't add up. How can you know what happens to the victims? How can you know what goes on in their unconscious minds?\nHAYTON: By monitoring their dreams, of course.\nDOCTOR: You can do that?\nHAYTON: Naturally.\nUKARME: Ukarme here. I've found some tracks.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Follow them. And be careful, Ukarme. I've already lost enough members of this expedition.\nUKARME: I didn't Know you cared, Major.\nTAKOL: [OC]:] don't. I just don't want to blot my career record by adding to the numbers of deaths under my command column.\nUKARME: I'm reassured by your concern. Wait. Major, there's something here. It's a woman.\nTAKOL: [OC]: What state is she in?\nUKARME: Alive, and in deep sleep. No sign of the other one.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Get her loaded on the drone and back here right away. Full decontamination protocols for both of you.\nUKARME: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: You're seriously telling me that you have a machine capable of accessing a person's dreams?\nHAYTON: Yes.\nDOCTOR: I didn't realise human research in these fields was so advanced.\nHAYTON: It's not. We had help.\nDOCTOR: I see. Your machine is based on alien technology.\nHAYTON: We traded it from the Dreamweavers of the Goyana System. Oh, excuse me. Hayton here?\nTAKOL: [OC]: Professor, tell the Doctor that Ukarme's found one of his friends.\nDOCTOR: One? But they were together.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Sorry, he just found one. A dark-skinned girl.\nMALAROU: The prisoner, your Highness.\nKHARTO: My noble and just Queen. Kharto greets you, and humbly prostrates himself before your ineffable Majesty.\nERIMEM: Thank you, Malarou. You may leave us.\nMALAROU: But my Queen, Kharto is...\nERIMEM: Handcuffed and unarmed. Now, take your guards and leave us.\nMALAROU: As you command.\nERIMEM: You too, Andree.\nANDREE: I would rather stay with my Queen.\nERIMEM: So be it. Get up, Kharto. Your fervent loyalty is impressing no one.\nKHARTO: As you wish, my most honourable Queen.\nERIMEM: And you can stop that too. If you must call me anything, let it be Erimem. Now, I understand you have some issues with the way things are run around here.\nKHARTO: Some issues? You could say that. I think the future of this entire colony is in jeopardy.\nDOCTOR: Ukarme. Nice to see you again.\nUKARME: Doctor, Professor, she's over here.\nDOCTOR: Erimem. Was she like this when you found her?\nUKARME: Yes. In a deep sleep, surrounded by those plants. Are we to wake her?\nHAYTON: Absolutely not. That would be a very dangerous to do. Any attempt at sudden withdrawal from the\nHAYTON: dream state could cause extensive cerebral damage.\nUKARME: I don't understand.\nDOCTOR: Neither do I. Explain, Hayton. Those Heager Worms made a full recovery with no ill effects.\nHAYTON: That's because we revived them almost immediately. The dreams these plants initiate are complex neurological fantasies. They feel completely real. In some respects, they are real. And the longer you're under, the harder it is to tear the mind away from that reality. Your friend here looks to be at stage two.\nDOCTOR: Stage two?\nHAYTON: Stage one lasts only for the first few hours. There's no dreaming, just plant-induced sleep. I believe that the plant uses this time to access the victim's memories and construct a fantasy world to entrap their minds.\nDOCTOR: And stage two is when the dream world has been created, and the victim believes themselves to be awake in this fantasy.\nHAYTON: Correct. Stage three is the penultimate stage. The plant begins to physically bond with the victim, initiating the process of absorption.\nUKARME: And stage four?\nHAYTON: Death.\nERIMEM: So, Kharto, you would do things differently, I take it?\nKHARTO: I would. First off, stop living in the past. All these reminders of Ancient Egypt. What's the point?\nERIMEM: To remember where we came from.\nKHARTO: It's the twenty fifth century. The Pyramids would be dust by now had they not been encased in plastic.\nERIMEM: But if we forget our past we lose all sense of who we are.\nKHARTO: Who are we, then? Pale imitations of our ancient ancestors. Is that really why you came here in the first place? Is it?\nERIMEM: I... I don't know.\nKHARTO: You don't know?\nERIMEM: I can't seem to remember. A temporary amnesia, nothing more. What I do know for sure is that it is I and not you who leads this colony.\nKHARTO: Yet you cannot tell me by what right. You cannot even remember how you came to be here. No wonder the colony is on the brink of disaster.\nERIMEM: Andree! What on Earth are you doing? You... you've killed him.\nANDREE: And you, my Queen, will be next.\nDOCTOR: Erimem. Erimem, can you hear me?\nHAYTON: Don't, Doctor. You mustn't.\nDOCTOR: But if we can just get her to wake up... Surely there are stimulants you can use.\nHAYTON: Haven't you been listening to what I've been saying? These are more than dreams, they're complex controlled simulacrums of real life. Look at the med-schematics. Wild variations in her heartbeat, irregular breathing patterns, massive alpha wave activity. That's not normal for a sleeping person. As far as she's concerned, her dreamscape is real.\nDOCTOR: But what if something happened to her in the dream world? If she fell off a cliff, drowned?\nHAYTON: If she dies in the dream, she will die here in the lab too.\nERIMEM: Andree, think about it. My death will achieve nothing. You'll be dead before you can leave the building. Another martyr to the cause like poor Kharto here.\nANDREE: I care nothing for the cause. Last year when Kharto first began to speak out, there was a rally, an open meeting of people who were unhappy about your rule.\nERIMEM: I do not remember.\nANDREE: The Royal Guard arrived to break up the meeting, but that wasn't enough for you. You wanted to make an example of the malcontents. You ordered the guards to start firing into the crowd.\nERIMEM: No, I would never...\nANDREE: They gunned down forty men and women, my parents included.\nERIMEM: I refuse to believe it.\nANDREE: They showed no mercy, and neither will I. I failed in my first attempt, to poison you.\nERIMEM: The food taster. You mean that was you?\nANDREE: This time you will not be so lucky. Goodbye, your Majesty.\nERIMEM: No. Andree, please!"

You're not just some guy who works at the City and District Hospital, you're a... a friend.\nGUIDO: [TV]: A friend?\nCARLA: [TV]: Don't tell me you don't like the idea?\nGUIDO: (TV) No, no, it isn't that...\nPERI: I was beginning to worry about you.\nMIKE: Oh, sorry.\nMIKE: Got held up at the office.\nPERI: Held down, you mean, by some leggy blonde.\nMIKE: Ha, ha, ha, I wish. Joke. And don't pout like that. You know I find it wildly erotic.\nPERI: Come here and say that.\nMIKE: Is everything all right? Kyle hasn't laid into you again?\nPERI: No, no, nothing like that.\nMIKE: Oh, it's all a bit much for him. It was bad enough when I started dating again after Rachel left, but he accepted that... eventually, and he'll accept you too in time.\nPERI: I hope so.\nMIKE: Trust me. Everything's going to be all right, as long as we have each other, eh?\nPERI: Mmm.\nMIKE: Now, what's for dinner?\nPERI: Oh.\nERIMEM: Andree? Please, Andree, breathe.\nANDREE: I... despised you.\nERIMEM: Why didn't you set it on stun, you foo!!\nMALAROU: Oh, I am sorry, your Highness. She was about to kill you. I didn't have time to stop and think.\nERIMEM: Kharto. He's alive! Quick, Malarou, fetch the medics.\nMALAROU: But my Queen, he is our enemy.\nERIMEM: He is an opponent, not an enemy. And if this colony is to survive, we need him alive. Dead, he'll be a martyr to fanatics. Now, get those medics!\nDOCTOR: How is she?\nHAYTON: She seems stable for now. Classic stage two.\nDOCTOR: There must be something we can do to help her.\nUKARME: The Doctor's right, Professor. Isn't there anything we can do?\nHAYTON: Well, there is one possibility but it's totally untested.\nUKARME: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Tell me. Anything is better than watching Erimem die in slow stages.\nHAYTON: I've been experimenting on the plants, trying to extract the agent that causes these dreams.\nDOCTOR: To develop an antidote?\nHAYTON: Not exactly.\nDOCTOR: Then what?\nHAYTON: I think I can use it to put someone - you, Doctor - into a similar state of unconsciousness.\nUKARME: What would be the point of that?\nHAYTON: The point, Ukarme, is that I can then use the Dream Scanner to harmonise the alpha waves generated in the Doctor's hypothalamus with those of his companion here. Then the plant extract should boost his natural telepathic abilities, allowing him to enter Erimem's dreamscape.\nUKARME: But that's impossible.\nDOCTOR: No. Just highly improbable. Lucid dreaming. You think it'll work?\nHAYTON: There's a chance. If you can persuade her that the reality she perceives is false, she may wake up safely.\nDOCTOR: Then what are we waiting for? Let's get Erimem to your laboratory.\nHAYTON: It will be risky. Much of this is just theory and speculation. I've not yet had the opportunity to test out these ideas.\nDOCTOR: Then let me be your guinea pig. And Ukarme?\nUKARME: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Find my other companion. Find Peri.\nPERI: Kyle?\nKYLE: [OC]: What?\nPERI: Kyle.\nKYLE: [OC]: What?\nPERI: Can I come in?\nANNOUNCER: [TV OC]: Previously on Love MD.\nKYLE: [OC]: No.\nPERI: Kyle, you need to get dressed and go to school.\nKYLE: [OC]: Can't. I've got a headache.\nPERI: Then take something and get back to sleep. Don't lie around watching trash on the TV.\nKYLE: [OC]: Thanks for the sympathy. I'll text you when I die.\nPERI: (sigh) As you like to say, whatever.\nHAYTON: Right, that's both of you hooked up to the monitors. Sorry about the audience, by the way.\nDOCTOR: He's probably excited to see someone else being operated on.\nTAKOL: What the hell's going on here? Ukarme muttered something to me about an experiment.\nHAYTON: The Doctor's volunteered to test the plant extract I told you about.\nTAKOL: Is that wise?\nHAYTON: I need to know if this stuff works. Arm please, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And I need to help my friend before it's too late.\nHAYTON: This shouldn't hurt.\nDOCTOR: Ow!\nHAYTON: You'll feel very fatigued, very quickly. Can you count backwards from ten for me, please?\nDOCTOR: Certainly. Ten, nine, eight... er, six.\nHAYTON: He's gone.\nTAKOL: Where?\nHAYTON: Into dreamland.\nMALAROU: The outer walls of the palace have been breached, your Highness.\nERIMEM: What of Kharto? Can he not speak to the rebels, delay them?\nMALAROU: Alas, my Queen, he is currently unconscious in his cell.\nERIMEM: Then it is over. The rebellion has succeeded.\nMALAROU: No. While you are free there is hope.\nERIMEM: But I am not free, am I? I am trapped.\nMALAROU: Then be trapped on your own terms. You are aware of the Panic Room that was constructed in your quarters?\nERIMEM: Panic Room?\nMALAROU: It is just a precaution. You will be safe there while we rally our troops and eject the rebels.\nERIMEM: And if you fail?\nMALAROU: The Panic Room has communications. You can negotiate or call to off-worlders for aid. Either way you will be safe.\nERIMEM: While my country crumbles around me.\nTAKOL: Report, Ukarme.\nUKARME: [OC]: Harvesting initiated, Major, as requested.\nTAKOL: Excellent. The shuttle will be down before nightfall. Make sure we have enough samples to fill the hold. Takol out.\nHAYTON: I thought he was supposed to be looking for the Doctor's other companion.\nTAKOL: I have other priorities. Yes, Ukarme, what is it?\nUKARME: [OC]:The safety override has cut in. Forward scan threw up a foreign body, Major, and the harvester went into emergency shutdown. I'm checking it out now.\nTAKOL: Can't you just harvest it along with the plants? We don't have time for this.\nUKARME: [OC]: Afraid not, sir. The safety protocols won't allow it in case the machine gets damaged. I could always... Wait! Major, it's the other woman, half-buried in the plants.\nHAYTON: Oh. What condition is she in, Ukarme?\nUKARME: [OC]: It's - hard to tell where she ends and the plants begin.\nHAYTON: Bring her in. I need to see this.\nUKARME: [OC]: I'll have to cut her free first.\nHAYTON: No. Dig her up. Use the harvester's forward scoop. I want the plant that's consuming her too. And hurry. Hayton out. This could be the breakthrough we need.\nTAKOL: Oh, now what?\nHAYTON: The machine's monitoring the Doctor's delta waves. That signal means he's now in synch with his friend here. He's in.\nMALAROU: The Panic Room, your Highness.\nERIMEM: Ironic, isn't it? Knharto was complaining that we are too obsessed with the past, and here is a sealed chamber that could have graced one of the Pyramids. I hope it is not destined to become my tomb.\nMALAROU: I will not abandon you, my Queen.\nERIMEM: But if something should happen to you?\nMALAROU: There is another way out. A secret door on the far wall that leads to an escape tunnel. That will take you to a safe house. The details are here in this file.\nERIMEM: And how do I stay in contact with you? How will I know what is happening?\nMALAROU: The screens are patched into the security network. You have full audio and video communications, including off-world.\nERIMEM: Right, then. You'd better seal me in before I change my mind. You are certain that this is for the best?\nMALAROU: Positive. Farewell, my Queen. May the Gods protect you.\nDOCTOR: (distorted) Hello. I wonder whether you can... (normal)... help me.\nMALAROU: Oh! Who are you, and how did you get into the Inner Palace?\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, and I've just arrived.\nMALAROU: No space craft have landed today.\nDOCTOR: It's all a bit mysterious, I admit, but I assure you I pose no threat to you or your world. Mister...?\nMALAROU: I am First Minister Malarou of the colony New Cairo on the planet Kandoor.\nDOCTOR: New Cairo, eh? That explains the ancient Egyptian decor. What on Earth has Erimem got going on in her subconscious to come up with something like this?\nMALAROU: Security alert. Ra sector.\nDOCTOR: Now, there's no need for that. I'm just here for a quick word with Erimem. Is she through there?\nMALAROU: Stand back. No one but a rebel would dare speak the Queen's name with such a lack of respect.\nDOCTOR: Queen? Of course, I should have guessed. It's Queen Erimem,, is it? Well, it's her dream, I suppose.\nMALAROU: Guards, seize him and put him in the cells with his friend Kharto. Let's see if that jogs his memory at all.\nDOCTOR: It's not my memory that needs jogging. Now, listen, Minister Malarou, I need to see Queen Erimem urgently. It's a matter of life and death.\nMALAROU: I'm sure it is, but I'm afraid we're not so accommodating to assassins round here. The Queen is safe within the heart of this Palace, and there she will stay until your pathetic rebellion is crushed. Take him away.\nDOCTOR: (receding) You don't understand. It's not part of any rebellion, it's vitally important that I speak to the Queen. Listen to me!\nPERI: Kyle, honey?\nGUIDO: [YV OC]: Sorry, Doctor Love.\nPERI: I made you some sandwiches.\nCARLA: [OC]: I thought we agreed you were going to call me Carla.\nPERI: Ta-da! Sandwiches.\nCARLA: [TV]: Guido, please.\nPERI: Oh, come on, Kyle.\nCARLA: [TV]: What's wrong?\nGUIDO: [TV]: I... can't tell you.\nPERI: Kyle?\nCARLA: [OC]: You're hiding something.\nPERI: Oh no.\nCARLA: [TV]: Why don't you just tell me?\nPERI: Kyle, can you hear me, honey? I'm getting help. Oh Jeez, you're burning up.\nOPERATOR: [OC]: Emergency services. Which service do you require?\nPERI: Oh yes. Ambulance. I need an ambulance. My stepson's unconscious.\nUKARME: Here she is, Professor, what's left of her.\nHAYTON: Good work, Ukarme.\nHAYTON: Remarkable. The kyropites are bonding with her skin, keeping her alive while simultaneously\nHAYTON: killing her.\nUKARME: What's that?\nHAYTON: Increased brainwave activity. Her heartbeat's racing too. She must be experiencing something traumatic in her dream.\nUKARME: I never realised dreams could affect our bodies to this extent.\nHAYTON: The human brain is a very powerful thing, Ukarme. The relationship between mind and body is still very much a mystery.\nUKARME: Not to these plants.\nHAYTON: You're not as stupid as you look, are you?\nUKARME: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Professor.\nHAYTON: Sorry. I meant no offence. I just have a very dim view of the military mind.\nTAKOL: Well Professor, how's the human vegetable?\nHAYTON: (sotto) And with good reason.\nTAKOL: Sorry?\nHAYTON: Nothing, Major. Just a little joke between Ukarme and myself. The human vegetable, as you put it, is well into stage three. The tendrils have already begun to bond to the skin. Over the next twenty four hours the cells in the epidermis will begin to mutate.\nTAKOL: And then?\nHAYTON: Who knows? Perhaps she'll become some kind of human-plant hybrid. Once we get her to the med lab and I run some tests I'll be able to tell you more.\nTAKOL: How are the Doctor and the other girl?\nHAYTON: No change. A brief peak in his alpha waves a while ago, but nothing since.\nTAKOL: Ukarme, after you've finished being the Professor's porter, get back to monitoring the harvesters. I want that ship full of these plants and in orbit as soon as possible.\nUKARME: Yes, Major.\nTAKOL: Nothing must delay the harvest. Not even you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No good. Won't budge.\nKHARTO: You surprise me. I take it this is your first experience of being in a prison cell.\nDOCTOR: Not at all. I've escaped from more cells than you've had hot dinners.\nUKARME: Really.\nDOCTOR: My old friend Harry Houdini taught me a thing or two about picking locks. No box can hold me, he always said, and it worked a treat for him. Until he died, of course.\nUKARME: (laughs) A fine mentor he was, my friend.\nDOCTOR: You have a point. I'm the Doctor, by the way, and you are...?\nKHARTO: My name is Kharto.\nDOCTOR: Kharto? Malarou mentioned you. I take it you're something to do with the rebellion?\nKHARTO: I'm supposed to be its leader. (laughs) Not much use, am I, banged up in here?\nDOCTOR: Let's see if we can do something about that.\nKHARTO: You're serious?\nDOCTOR: Most of the time. Let's have a look at this door. Hmm. So tell me, what's this revolt all about?\nKHARTO: Our Queen is living in the past, trying to make this colony some kind of living museum, a recreation of our ancient home on Earth.\nDOCTOR: And that's a bad thing?\nKHARTO: It's nearly three millennia since the time of the Pharaohs. We're hundreds of light years away from Earth. We need to live in the here and now, not some dream of times past.\nDOCTOR: But Erimem prefers this dream. Interesting.\nKHARTO: You speak of her as if you know her.\nDOCTOR: Indeed I do. And I need to speak to her urgently. If only I can open this door. I'm not sure where she is, but I have my suspicions. Malarou mentioned something about her being safe in the heart of the palace.\nKHARTO: The Panic Room.\nDOCTOR: The Panic Room? You know about it?\nKHARTO: (laughs) My brother built it. Get me out of this cell, Doctor, and I can get you into that room in no time. I too would like to speak to Queen Erimem. We have unfinished business, she and I.\nTANNOY: Paging Doctor Paris. Paging Doctor Paris.\nPERI: Come on, come on, pick up. Ah. Darling, it's me. I'm...\nMIKE: [OC]: Hi. Neither Mike, Kyle or Peri are in right now, so leave a message at the sound of the tone.\nPERI: Mike, where the hell are you? The office said you'd gone out, but your mobile's switched off, and you're not at home either. Now, don't panic, but you need to get to the hospital at once. Saint Peter's. It's Kyle. He's got meningitis. We think he's going to be okay, but...\nPERI: Damn!\nTANNOY: Flanagan please come to Reception. Doctor Flanagan please come...\nDOCTOR: No obvious weakness in that wall either. So, Kharto, how do you fit into Erimem's world? What purpose do you serve in it, I wonder?\nKHARTO: Erimem's world? Ha! If you're suggesting she created this colony all by herself you are sadly mistaken. There were thousands of colony ships, twelve great founders.\nDOCTOR: Really? And just who were they, these great founders? What are their names? When did their colony ships arrive? Where are they from?\nKHARTO: They were... I don't know. What's wrong with me, Doctor? Why can't I remember anything?\nDOCTOR: It's a little complicated to explain. Right now though I think we should concentrate on getting this door open.\nKHARTO: Dream on, my friend. You'll never open that door.\nDOCTOR: Dream on. Of course. If this is a dreamscape, I can manipulate it. If I can just concentrate.\nKHARTO: How did you do that?\nDOCTOR: Mind over matter. Come on.\nKYLE: (coughs) Dad?\nPERI: Kyle? You're awake. I'll fetch the nurse.\nKYLE: Wait. Where's Dad?\nPERI: He's on his way, honey.\nKYLE: I'm half dead and he's... on his way?\nPERI: I promise you. He'll be here very soon.\nKYLE: I felt so bad, and you just told me to take some pills.\nPERI: I made a mistake. I'm... I'm sorry, Kyle. Kyle? Okay, honey. You can hear my apologies later. For now, sleep well and sweet dreams.\nERIMEM: Malarou? Come in please, Malarou, this is Erimem calling. Oh, where has he got to?\nERIMEM: Who's there? Malarou, is that you?\nDOCTOR: No, Erimem, it's me. The Doctor.\nERIMEM: Doctor? But you... This can't be happening. This is some kind of trick. You changed, you... you left me.\nDOCTOR: Erimem, please, you have to listen to me. This colony, this world, none of it's real. It's an illusion. A dream.\nERIMEM: Are you mad? Why would I dream about rebels, and food tasters dying and servants betraying me?\nDOCTOR: Your dream is being directed, controlled by parasitic plants we encountered on an alien world.\nERIMEM: Stop it, Doctor, you're frightening me.\nKHARTO: Doctor, someone's coming up the passageway. Guards, I think. I'll hold them off as long as I can.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Kharto. We won't be long.\nERIMEM: Kharto? But he was locked up. What's going on, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This world, it doesn't make sense. It's a mishmash of your old home on Earth and the kinds of frontier worlds you visited with me in the Tardis.\nERIMEM: Oh, this is the Terran colony New Cairo on the planet Kandoor, part of the Hyran System.\nDOCTOR: There is no such colony, never was, never will be. This is all an illusion and you have to reject it.\nKHARTO: [OC]: Keep back, both of you.\nDOCTOR: Think about it, Erimem. Where did Kharto get that gun from? He wasn't carrying it when he came in just now. Why is it always the same two guards who appear? Where is everyone else in this great colony?\nERIMEM: I... I need to speak to Malarou. He'll know the truth.\nDOCTOR: Malarou doesn't exist. You have to wake up, Erimem. You have to remember. We landed on a jungle planet - you, me and Peri - and we all fell victim to these parasitical telepathic plants.\nERIMEM: But Peri left us, ages ago.\nKHARTO: [OC]: Doctor, I can't hold them off. They... argh!\nDOCTOR: Where? Tell me where and how Peri left.\nERIMEM: I... I can't remember.\nDOCTOR: Because it never happened. It's a detail your subconscious never bothered to establish, like the\nDOCTOR: details about how this colony works or how it was founded.\nERIMEM: Oh, this is all madness.\nMALAROU: And the madness stops now.\nDOCTOR: First Minister Malarou.\nMALAROU: Your Highness, this alien is dangerous. He's playing with your mind, but you must be strong. Reject him, ignore his lies. You must accept this reality.\nERIMEM: Must accept this reality? What you know of different realities, Malarou?\nMALAROU: Queen Erimem, I merely wish to protect you from this warlock. He has cast a spell on you.\nERIMEM: Have you cast a spell on me, Doctor? How else can you be in my dream but by magic?\nDOCTOR: Magic? Nonsense. I'm using some advanced alien technology.\nERIMEM: That sounds like the Doctor I remember.\nDOCTOR: I am the Doctor you remember. Now Erimem, close your eyes and listen to me. You are not in this room. This room does not exist. You are in a medical bed in a lab.\nMALAROU: No, my Queen. Don't listen to him. The rebellion is crushed. New Cairo is\nDOCTOR: There is an air purifier operating in the room. Can you hear it? Feel the air as it passes over your sleeping body.\nMALAROU: (fading) Stay with us. Help us build a new world.\nDOCTOR: You're asleep, that's all. Now it's time to wake up.\nDOCTOR: Erimem?\nUKARME: She seems to be coming out of it now, Doctor. Welcome back, by the way. And well done.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Ukarme. Where's Hayton?\nUKARME: The Professor had to leave. He went to the med lab.\nERIMEM: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I'm here, Erimem. How are you feeling?\nERIMEM: Like I've been asleep for ages. I had the strangest dream. It was so vivid. Aman called Malarou was there, and so were you. Where are we?\nDOCTOR: In a laboratory on the jungle planet YT45.\nERIMEM: And where is Peri?\nUKARME: I can answer that one. I found her, Doctor. She's alive. That's why the Professor dashed off. He has her in the med lab now.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Good work, Ukarme. Can you keep an eye on Erimem for me?\nUKARME: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Then I'll go and see Hayton. He's got some explaining to do.\nTANNOY: Consultant to Paediatrics, please. Consultant to Paediatrics.\nPERI: Come on, Ally. What's the point of having a best friend if they don't pick up the damn phone? Oh, great. First my boyfriend, now my best friend. Who's going to be next to ignore my call, my mother? Well, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Home time.\nHAYTON: Look at her. Can you see? Incredible, isn't it?\nTAKOL: [OC]: If you like that sort of thing.\nHAYTON: My theory is correct. The process of absorption leads to a mutation in the DNA structure. Changes are happening at a chemical level in the victim's brain.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Giving us a means to unlock telepathic ability in humans.\nHAYTON: It certainly looks that way.\nTAKOL: [OC]: I need to report this to High Command. Good work, Hayton.\nHAYTON: My pleasure. Right then, my dear, let's open you up and see exactly what's going on, shall we?\nDOCTOR: Professor. Would you mind putting that laser cutter down and moving away from your patient?\nHAYTON: Doctor. It worked, then. Is Erimem awake?\nDOCTOR: Never mind Erimem, it's Peri I'm concerned with at the moment.\nHAYTON: Peri? Oh, you mean the hybrid here. I'm sorry. I know she was your friend, but there's nothing that can be done for her now.\nDOCTOR: How can you be so sure?\nHAYTON: Because she's already well into stage three. She won't die in vain, though. She can still be useful to us, as a Subject.\nDOCTOR: Leave her alone, Hayton. I'm warning you.\nHAYTON: I'm sorry, Doctor. I cannot allow you to stand in the way of scientific advancement because of some trivial emotional attachment you may harbour.\nUKARME: Here. Have some water.\nERIMEM: Thank you. Ukarme, is it?\nUKARME: Yes. I was the one who found you out in the jungle, and brought you back here.\nERIMEM: Then I am indebted to you.\nUKARME: Oh, I'm just glad to see you up and about. How are you feeling?\nERIMEM: Very strange. I'm not entirely convinced that this is not a dream too.\nUKARME: What was it like, when you were in the dream place?\nERIMEM: It felt... (sighs)... real.\nUKARME: You had no idea that you were dreaming?\nERIMEM: Not really. Everything seemed to make sense at the time. I was the ruler of a space colony.\nUKARME: (laughs) Really? You must have a very well-developed ego.\nERIMEM: (laughs) You should have seen me back home.\nUKARME: Little Miss Absolute Ruler.\nERIMEM: (laughs) You have no idea.\nPERI: Mike? I'm home, honey. Where have you been? I was beginning to panic until I saw your car out front. Mike? Mike? Is that you?\nPERI: Mike? Ally?\nALLY: Oh my God. Peri.\nMIKE: I... I can explain.\nPERI: What's to explain? I've just found my boyfriend in my bedroom with my best friend. Doesn't get much clearer than that.\nMIKE: No, wait, please, just hear me out.\nPERI: I don't want to. Just leave me alone!\nMIKE: Peri? Peri?\nERIMEM: It was so real, you could taste it. More vivid than anything I've ever dreamt before.\nUKARME: And how do you feel now? Does your dream seem less real?\nERIMEM: Not at the moment. Maybe it will in time. Why are you so interested? I thought you were a soldier, not a scientist.\nUKARME: Maybe there is more to me than just this uniform.\nERIMEM: I'm sorry, Ukarme, that was rude of me. I don't know you at all. I'd no right to make assumptions.\nUKARME: It is I who should apologise to you. I haven't been entirely honest with you.\nERIMEM: Oh, I should have known. You were too polite for a soldier. Well, are you going to kill me or make me your prisoner?\nDOCTOR: Is that what this is all about? Scientific advancement?\nHAYTON: Why else would I be risking my life in this hell-hole? It's hardly a top vacation spot.\nDOCTOR: So that's why you had samples of the plant extract ready to hand. You're planning to sell it on the open market.\nHAYTON: The mind controlling properties alone make it commercially viable, but thanks to your friend here, I may also be able to isolate the chemical that stimulates telepathic ability. Think of the possible markets for a drug like that.\nDOCTOR: I cannot allow it.\nHAYTON: And who are you to stop me?\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.\nHAYTON: Ah, of course! You're FDA, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: FDA?\nHAYTON: Don't play dumb. The Federation Drugs Administration. I knew you pen-pushing bureaucrats would eventually catch up with me. Well, you can tell your bosses they can forget it. I'll bypass their ridiculously long and expensive drugs trials and make a fortune before they can do a thing about it.\nDOCTOR: And what about the military who funded this mission? How are they going to feel about you taking this for your own?\nHAYTON: Takol's a fool, and so are High Command.\nMIKE: Peri, come back! It's not how it looks!\nPERI: Leave me alone. How could you do that to me? To your son!\nMIKE: Peri, look out!"

What's wrong?\nHAYTON: The girl's vital signs are flat-lining. Something must have happened in her dream, some trauma or shock.\nDOCTOR: Then we have to do something.\nHAYTON: Stop that, Doctor. You could do more damage than good.\nDOCTOR: I can't just stand here and do nothing.\nHAYTON: That's exactly what you have to do. I'm not interested in keeping this specimen alive. I need to see what happens when brain death occurs, how the plant reacts.\nDOCTOR: You're inhuman.\nHAYTON: Look who's talking. Now step away or regrettably I'll be forced to shoot you.\nDOCTOR: What?\nHAYTON: Keep your hands where I can see them.\nDOCTOR: I thought you were a man of science.\nHAYTON: I thought you were too.\nTAKOL: Pick the gun up, Doctor. I only set mine to stun, so he could come to at any moment.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing here, Major?\nTAKOL: The idiot left the vid-link active, I heard every treacherous word that escaped his boastful lips.\nDOCTOR: Well, they say pride comes before a fall. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to help Peri. What have we here? Ah, adrenalin. Forty ccs should do it.\nTAKOL: Will that help?\nDOCTOR: We'll have to wait and see. What will you do with the Professor now?\nTAKOL: He'll be relieved of duty and confined to quarters. He can be put on the brig when we get to the mothership.\nDOCTOR: You're leaving?\nTAKOL: Got to get off this rock before nightfall.\nDOCTOR: Peri. Can you hear me, Peri?\nTAKOL: How is she?\nDOCTOR: Stabilising. Her vital signs are recovering, but I need to get into her dream.\nTAKOL: Let's get the Professor here safely locked away, then we can see what can be done to help your friend.\nPERI: Where am I?\nMIKE: Outside the house, honey. You were lucky. The car only glanced you.\nPERI: What? It hit me full-on. I... I felt it. I was as good as dead.\nMIKE: Looking good for a corpse, kiddo.\nPERI: Where is Ally?\nMIKE: Calling for an ambulance to take you to the hospital. Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay.\nERIMEM: Where are you taking me?\nUKARME: There's something I want to show you. Here.\nERIMEM: A door? Believe me, I've seen one before.\nUKARME: You won't have seen what's inside before.\nERIMEM: The sign says Keep Out - Quarantine Area.\nUKARME: Don't worry, it's safe. Come on.\nHAYTON: This is ridiculous. You can't lock me up like this.\nTAKOL: Watch me.\nHAYTON: I'm well-connected. You're making a big mistake.\nTAKOL: No, Professor, it is you who have made a mistake. I am in command of this mission and I will not tolerate any insubordination. Goodbye.\nHAYTON: [OC]: Takol!\nDOCTOR: I've taken Peri to the lab. Will Hayton be secure in there?\nTAKOL: As long as we're not here after nightfall.\nDOCTOR: What happens after dark?\nTAKOL: The monsters come out.\nDOCTOR: I take it that's not a metaphorical statement?\nTAKOL: This planet has a diurnal cycle that lasts about a hundred and fourteen hours. During the day it's a\nTAKOL: lovely place if you can stomach the heat, the mud slides and the murderous plants, but at night, it's something else.\nDOCTOR: How long have we got before sunset?\nTAKOL: The shuttle's due to land in half an hour. We evacuate fifteen minutes later.\nDOCTOR: Then we don't have much time. I have to get Peri out of that dream state.\nUKARME: This is the remains of the original expedition to this horrible planet.\nERIMEM: What happened here? It's like a disaster zone.\nUKARME: The base was overrun by those Jekyll things that live in the jungle.\nERIMEM: Like that creature in the laboratory? It didn't seem hostile.\nUKARME: Not everything is what it seems, Erimem.\nERIMEM: Who are you, Ukarme? What's really going on here?\nDOCTOR: Right, I'll make the connections, but I'll need you to inject me with the plant extract.\nTAKOL: I think I can manage that.\nDOCTOR: It's vitally important that no attempt is made to wake either of us during this procedure. It could be very dangerous.\nTAKOL: Understood.\nDOCTOR: And will you check on Erimem for me? I'm not sure where she's got to.\nTAKOL: Don't worry, Doctor. Ukarme's probably showing her the base, but I'll make sure she's safe.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now, let's get on with this. The sooner I can start interfacing with Peri, the sooner I can help her.\nTAKOL: Roll up your sleeve, then.\nANNOUNCER: [TV]: Previously on Love MD.\nCARLA: [TV]: Clamp. Clamp! What's wrong with you? Do you want this kid to bleed to death? Guido?\nMIKE: The doctor says you were really lucky. Hardly a mark on you. You can leave here tonight.\nPERI: And Kyle?\nMIKE: He's here. Don't worry. I had you moved in with him. Got to keep all my eggs in one basket. (laughs) It's all right. He's doing fine. But we're not out of the woods yet.\nPERI: I didn't take it seriously. I thought he just had a headache.\nMIKE: You weren't to know.\nPERI: I make a rotten stepmother.\nMIKE: I'd have done the same as you. Look, about what happened with Ally. I can explain.\nPERI: What's to explain?\nMIKE: It wasn't what it looked like. I love you, Peri, and only you.\nPERI: Oh, right. You love me, but you were with her. How does that work, then?\nMIKE: Nothing was going on, I promise.\nPERI: I see. I find Ally in her underwear with you, and I’m meant to believe that nothing is going on?\nMIKE: It was meant to be a surprise for you.\nPERI: Well, that bit worked.\nMIKE: She was trying on a dress. Adress I'd bought for you.\nPERI: Oh, come on. You've never bought me a dress before.\nMIKE: True, but then I've never had to plan a surprise wedding before either.\nPERI: What?\nMIKE: Ally's been helping me. She's the same build as you, so she was trying on the dress to see if it would fit you. I was going to surprise you with the whole thing. The last-minute holiday to the Caribbean, the spontaneous proposal, a wedding dress waiting in the cabin. I'd been planning it for months.\nPERI: But, I...\nMIKE: Oh well, this isn't the way I wanted to do it, but what the heck. Perpugilliam Brown, will you marry me?\nUKARME: I'm an undercover agent of the FDA. That's the Federation Drugs Administration.\nERIMEM: You're some kind of policeman?\nUKARME: Six months ago, a routine survey mission visited this place and stumbled upon the unique properties of the indigenous plant life, the kyropites.\nERIMEM: The plants that make you dream?\nUKARME: Exactly.\nERIMEM: But why come undercover?\nUKARME: Well, we couldn't be certain what happened here. Parts of the survey report were missing, the data was corrupted, and there was the suggestion of a cover-up, but not enough real evidence for us to act.\nERIMEM: Couldn't you simply talk to the people who came here?\nUKARME: None of them survived.\nERIMEM: I'm sorry.\nUKARME: So am I. Four people died here. Listen to this. It's the last message that was received from the survey crew.\nARANDA: [OC]: This is Captain Aranda issuing a warning to all spacefarers. You must keep away from this planet. It's hostile, repeat, hostile and dangerous. If this recording reaches the outside world, please tell my family I love them. We thought this planet was a paradise, but we were wrong. It's deadly. The plants, the wildlife. All...(glass breaks, screams and growls.)\nUKARME: Captain Aranda was my sister.\nERIMEM: In the background was that a... a Jekyll?\nUKARME: Yes. The Jekylls killed the survey crew, and then shared their kill with the plants.\nERIMEM: If the creatures attack that crew, might they not do the same to this one?\nUKARME: We expect them to, as soon as night falls. Which is why the shuttle is due to land any moment. But I have enough evidence now to make my report on what Hayton's been doing here. I just need to make sure it reaches my bosses back home.\nERIMEM: Why not just report him to the Major?\nUKARME: Takol? That wouldn't be a very good idea. She's Hayton's partner in this.\nHAYTON: Cheers.\nHAYTON: Was this charade really necessary, Takol? Tasering me then locking me up in my cabin?\nTAKOL: Don't be petulant. I needed the time to think. If the Doctor is FDA, we need to play this carefully.\nHAYTON: I think killing him would have solved all our problems here.\nTAKOL: It's far better he dies in an accident while investigating your procedures.\nHAYTON: Whatever. As long as he doesn't jeopardise the operation.\nMIKE: Look, Peri, I can see this has come as a bit of a shock.\nPERI: You can say that again.\nMIKE: Why don't I try and rustle us up a couple of coffees? Give you some time alone to think about it.\nPERI: Yeah, sure.\nMIKE: Keep an eye on Kyle now. Make sure he doesn't go running off.\nPERI: I will. Er, thanks, Mike.\nMIKE: Two coffees coming right up.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Would you know if I'd find Miss Brown in there?\nMIKE: Sorry, who are you?\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.\nMIKE: Are you the consultant that's looking after our son?\nDOCTOR: No. No, not exactly. I've, er... Your son? I wasn't aware that Peri had a...\nMIKE: Oh right, yeah, my son. But Peri is his stepmother. Or will be when we get married. I've just proposed, actually.\nDOCTOR: Then I suppose congratulations are in order. Look, would you mind if I went in there for a few moments? The consultant asked me to, er, provide a second opinion.\nMIKE: About Kyle? Surely it's either meningitis or it's not?\nDOCTOR: Well, I think it's best I take a look just in case. Belt and braces, eh?\nMIKE: Okay, then. You'd better go in.\nUKARME: No one about. Good. Well, there they are.\nERIMEM: Peri! What's happened to her?\nUKARME: The plant is beginning to bond with her DNA. The Doctor is attempting to get through to her telepathically.\nERIMEM: Like he did with me?\nUKARME: Exactly, but Peri is in a much later stage of this thing. It's not going to be easy for him.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Ukarme, where are you?\nUKARME: Er, checking the harvesters, sir.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Get back inside this base immediately.\nUKARME: Will do, sir. How are the Doctor and his companions?\nTAKOL: [OC]: There have been developments since you left the base. It transpires that the Doctor and his friends are hostile alien spies. The Doctor managed to stun the Professor and make his getaway, and we haven't seen his accomplice for some time. Be on your guard, Ukarme. They are to be shot on sight, understand?\nUKARME: Yes, sir.\nTAKOL: [OC]: Takol out.\nERIMEM: Sounds like the Major's decided to show her true colours.\nUKARME: Well, we can't move the Doctor and Peri, so we'll just have to make sure Takol and co can't get to\nUKARME: us. Here, help me with this table.\nERIMEM: Will this hold them?\nUKARME: Not on its own, no. If I can just reprogramme this default, I can override the door controls and lock us in. There. That'll stop 'em for a while.\nERIMEM: What was that?\nUKARME: The shuttle's coming in. We're running out of time. Whatever the Doctor is doing, he'd better do it\nUKARME: quickly.\nPERI: Ah, doctor. Come to see how he is, then?\nDOCTOR: I see things have progressed further than I'd hoped.\nPERI: But Kyle is going to be okay, isn't he?\nDOCTOR: I wasn't talking about the boy, I'm talking about you. You don't recognise me, do you?\nPERI: I'm sorry. Did we meet before?\nDOCTOR: Peri, I know this will sound strange, but you have to believe me. You are dreaming. This whole thing, the hospital, your boyfriend, your son, none of it is real.\nPERI: What kind of a doctor are you?\nDOCTOR: I'm not a doctor, I'm the Doctor. Now, Peri, please, concentrate. Look at me. What do you see?\nPERI: A chubby man with glasses and a nasty case of acne.\nDOCTOR: Really? Look again. What am I wearing?\nPERI: A white coat, of course, and a stethoscope round your neck.\nDOCTOR: And in my lapel?\nPERI: Your lapel? It's a... a stick of celery. Doctor?\nHAYTON: Be careful with them. Those plant samples are priceless.\nDRONE: Affirmative, Professor Hayton.\nTAKOL: Calm yourself, Hayton. I programmed the drones myself. They'll be more than capable of conveying the samples on board safely.\nHAYTON: I didn't realise we'd be in such a hurry. How long have we got?\nTAKOL: About ten minutes until nightfall. As soon as we're loaded I'm taking off.\nHAYTON: I'll get Ukarme and the girl. We need her. She's a perfect specimen of the advanced stage.\nTAKOL: Be quick. I won't wait.\nHAYTON: You're all heart, Major.\nPERI: But that's not possible, Doctor. I left you years ago.\nKYLE: Peri? Mum?\nPERI: Kyle! Oh, you called me mum.\nKYLE: Dad told me I had to start getting used to the idea.\nPERI: Mike! Kyle's awake.\nDOCTOR: Peri, please, you have to listen to me.\nPERI: I'm sorry, Doctor, but my son has just had a brush with death, and... and I've been hit by a car and then proposed to. My life is complicated enough right now without you trying to tell me it's not real.\nPERI: Mike! He's back with us.\nMIKE: That's fantastic news.\nDOCTOR: Peri, this isn't real. It's like some bad soap opera concocted by your imagination.\nKYLE: Go away, Doctor. Mummy doesn't need you.\nMIKE: Yes, Doctor. Get out and leave us alone.\nPERI: I think you should go now, Doctor.\nHAYTON: [OC]: Ukarme. What's going on? Open these doors immediately. I need to check on the Doctor and the girl.\nUKARME: I'm sorry, Professor, that isn't possible.\nHAYTON: [OC]: That is an order, soldier.\nUKARME: I'm sorry, Professor, but I take my orders from the FDA.\nHAYTON: [OC]: So you're the FDA spy. I knew the Doctor was too stupid to be one of their operatives.\nUKARME: If I were you, Professor, I'd find a place of safety. It sounds like the Jekylls may have got your scent.\nHAYTON: [OC]: The Jekylls? So soon?\nUKARME: It's nightfall out in the jungle. Time for the hunt.\nHAYTON: [OC]: You'll pay for this, Ukarme. Once we're in space I'll get the Major to destroy this laboratory.\nUKARME: I'd hurry if I were you.\nERIMEM: Shouldn't we let it out? The Jekyll?\nUKARME: Are you kidding? It'd rip us to shreds in a second.\nERIMEM: The shuttle?\nUKARME: Taking off with a cargo full of plants, I'll bet.\nERIMEM: But if those things get off this planet, they'll spread like some kind of plague.\nUKARME: Not if I can help it.\nTAKOL: Major Takol to mothership. Come in, Lieutenant Anders.\nTAKOL: ANDERS [OC]: (a woman) Anders here, sir.\nTAKOL: Shuttle is leaving the planet's troposphere. Estimated docking time - thirty minutes.\nTAKOL: ANDERS [OC]: Sir, we're picking up an odd reading here. Scans are showing some fluctuation in your engine performance.\nTAKOL: No sign of anything here.\nTAKOL: ANDERS [OC]: Sir, I suggest you get to a life pod immediately.\nTAKOL: Don't over-react, Anders, it's probably just a fault...\nHAYTON: Please, Ukarme. You've got to let me in, in the name of humanity. They're ripping the base to shreds.\nUKARME: [OC]: Humanity? It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?\nHAYTON: I went to the shuttle, but Takol had already taken off. She abandoned me.\nHAYTON: Please! They're breaking in everywhere. I can help you. I can help the Doctor and Peri. Please!\nMIKE: Look, either you leave of your own accord, or I make you leave.\nDOCTOR: Peri, concentrate. This isn't real, any of it. You're on an alien planet with me and Erimem.\nPERI: Erimem? But she was killed by crocodile-things.\nDOCTOR: The Krillian Horde? No, we escaped from them.\nMIKE: I'm going to fetch an orderly.\nDOCTOR: There aren't any orderlies, they don't exist. This hospital doesn't exist.\nKYLE: Don't listen to him, Mum.\nDOCTOR: Think, Peri. If you remember Erimem leaving, you must remember your own departure.\nPERI: Of course.\nDOCTOR: Tell me about it.\nPERI: Well, I... I, I can't remember.\nDOCTOR: Something as important as that? Giving up the opportunity to travel in Time and Space? You can't remember?\nPERI: It must have been the accident. I was stuck by a... by...\nMIKE: Oh my God! A petrol tanker's crashed into A & E! Quick, we have to get out!\nKYLE: Mum, please, help me.\nDOCTOR: Peri, your subconscious is doing everything it can to keep you here, but you have to give this life up. It's not your life, not yet.\nPERI: But... my family.\nMIKE: We have to go. The building is gonna collapse.\nKYLE: Mum, please. I need your help. I can't make it without you.\nDOCTOR: It's a trap, Peri.\nMIKE: Peri! My leg! Please, help me!\nKYLE: Mum, I can't move. Help.\nPERI: Mike! Kyle!\nDOCTOR: Choose a reality, Peri. This madness or life in the Tardis. Choose!\nDOCTOR: Choose! (echoes.)\nERIMEM: Let him in, Ukarme, we need him.\nUKARME: He's a murderer. He wanted Peri to die.\nERIMEM: And what are you? There were people on that shuttle. Did you think about them?\nUKARME: The shuttle has an Al pilot system. The only passenger was Major Takol. And after what she did\nUKARME: here, I won't be shedding any tears for her. But I'll let him in if that's what you want.\nHAYTON: Thank you, Ukarme. They were going to... He's escaping from his cage!\nUKARME: Erimem, look out! Give me that gun.\nERIMEM: You didn't have to kill it.\nHAYTON: Ten more seconds and he'd have been free to kill us all. Just like his compatriots out there, this is the jungle. It's kill or be killed.\nDOCTOR: Choose.\nERIMEM: Doctor?\nUKARME: Hayton, can you revive him?\nHAYTON: I can try and force him to wake, but it's very dangerous.\nERIMEM: Judging by the readouts on these screens, he's dying anyway.\nHAYTON: I'll try a neural stimulant.\nUKARME: Get a move on. Those doors won't hold forever.\nERIMEM: Is it working?\nHAYTON: No. He's gone into cardiac arrest. Stand back. We're losing him.\nUKARME: If he dies, I'm sending you back outside.\nUKARME: Well?\nHAYTON: I don't know.\nDOCTOR: Did you do both hearts?\nERIMEM: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Erimem. How nice to see you again. How's Peri?\nPERI: Mike. Kyle.\nERIMEM: Peri, it's me, Erimem.\nPERI: Erimem? I thought you were dead.\nHAYTON: Remarkable. The plant tissue is simply falling away.\nUKARME: Make your observations later, Professor. We need to get out of here.\nDOCTOR: I agree. Whatever's behind those doors, it doesn't sound very happy. Is there another way out?\nUKARME: These units are plastic. We should be able to cut our way directly through to the jungle.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Let's get on with it.\nUKARME: It's clear. No beasts around at the moment.\nDOCTOR: Right then. We need to get to the Tardis.\nUKARME: The what?\nERIMEM: Our ship. It's a big blue box.\nUKARME: Where is it?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. Where did you first find me?\nUKARME: Sector four north, by some caves.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Take us there. Come on, Hayton.\nHAYTON: But what about the Jekylls?\nDOCTOR: If we're quick we shouldn't have a problem. They're too busy ripping the base apart to bother with us.\nHAYTON: Can I at least have my weapon back?\nUKARME: I don't think so. You take it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, no. No, thank you. I've never liked the things. Give it to Erimem. Besides, I'll have my hands full carrying Peri.\nUKARME: This way.\nERIMEM: Doctor, that vine. Get down!\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nUKARME: Here comes some more!\nDOCTOR: It's the plants. They're not going to let us go without a fight.\nHAYTON: Help me.\nERIMEM: They've got the Professor!\nUKARME: I'll go back for him. You go on.\nDOCTOR: Don't be stupid, man. The vines are thicker back there than anywhere.\nHAYTON: (distant) No! Please!\nUKARME: Just take this. My report.\nHAYTON: (distant) No! Argh!\nUKARME: Make sure it reaches the FDA.\nDOCTOR: I promise.\nUKARME: Go! The caves are just through those trees. Your blue box must be there somewhere. Argh!\nDOCTOR: Ukarme!\nERIMEM: Doctor, we have to get Peri back to the Tardis.\nDOCTOR: No. You go. Help her. I must try and save Ukarme and Hayton.\nERIMEM: But it's too late, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I have to try, Erimem. Now, hurry!\nERIMEM: Doctor, wait!\nDOCTOR: Just get back to the Tardis!\nERIMEM: Doctor!\nUKARME: Ow, my leg.\nARANDA: Don't move. It's a sprain, that's all. You fell, little brother.\nUKARME: Aranda?\nARANDA: The grass has cushioned your fall.\nUKARME: But.. but you... you died.\nARANDA: No, I found a way to survive. Down here there's a hollow, away from where those plants grow. I've been here all this time. I survived, Ukarme, and so can you.\nUKARME: We don't have to hide any more, Aranda. We can leave. We just need to get to the Doctor's blue box.\nARANDA: His Tardis?\nUKARME: Yes. It's not far. Help me.\nERIMEM: Ukarme. Are we glad to see you. We thought it was those horrible Jekylls. Come into the Tardis, quickly.\nUKARME: We managed to give them the slip. Erimem, this is my sister Aranda.\nARANDA: Pleased to meet you.\nERIMEM: Likewise.\nUKARME: And this is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Aranda, I've heard so much about you. It's a pleasure to finally meet you face-to-face.\nARANDA: This is a very impressive spacecraft, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: One does one's best. I'm sure Peri would like to say hello. Erimem, would you take Aranda down to the lower decks? Thanks.\nERIMEM: Certainly. This way.\nUKARME: This is the nose cone, I take it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The rest of the ship buries itself on landing, leaving only the blue cone visible.\nUKARME: Ingenious.\nDOCTOR: Useful. Listen, Ukarme, would you and your sister like to stay with us? Travel the galaxy? We could do with crew members of your calibre.\nUKARME: Doctor, I'd... well... I'd love to.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Well, your first duty is to press the launch controls and start the countdown.\nUKARME: My pleasure.\nUKARME: Ten, nine, eight, seven...\nUKARME: Six, five, four...\nHAYTON: No. Ukarme...\nUKARME: Three.\nHAYTON: Fight against it, man.\nUKARME: Two.\nHAYTON: Don't let the plants...\nUKARME: One.\nHAYTON: Take over your mind.\nUKARME: Lift off.\nHAYTON: Ukarme.\nERIMEM: How are you feeling?\nPERI: (drinks) Groggy. I feel like I've swallowed a ton of earth. Where's the Doctor?\nERIMEM: He, er... he went to rescue Hayton and Ukarme, and...\nPERI: And what?\nERIMEM: And he's not back yet. It's been an hour.\nPERI: Then we need to go look for him.\nERIMEM: You're in no fit state to go out there.\nPERI: Oh, we're not just leaving him there. He may need our help. He may need...\nPERI: Oh, Doctor! Are we pleased to see you. Boy, you look pretty beaten up. Are you okay?\nERIMEM: Where's Ukarme? And Hayton? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Shut the doors, Erimem.\nERIMEM: Well, Doctor?\nPERI: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Transmitting Ukarme's report to his bosses.\nERIMEM: Doctor, where is Ukarme?\nDOCTOR: Dead.\nERIMEM: Dead?\nDOCTOR: I couldn't save him. He was too far gone when I found them. Hayton and Ukarme side by side, covered in tendrils.\nPERI: Surely we can do something?\nDOCTOR: Peri, don't you think I tried?\nERIMEM: Hayton wanted to experiment on you, Peri. And Ukarme? well, he had excellent motives, but - his methods were without honour. Peri?\nPERI: I'll be in my room if you want me. Too many people have died today. Too many. (internal door opens) My son among them.\nERIMEM: Doctor, Peri dreamt of having a family and settling down. Is that because she lost her own family so young?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nERIMEM: And me, I dreamt of... leaving you. What does that say about me? That I want to go home?\nDOCTOR: I honestly don't know. Do you want to stop travelling with us?\nERIMEM: Perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Maybe our next destination will help you make up your mind.\nERIMEM: And where will that be?\nDOCTOR: Who knows? The universe is ours to explore, Erimem. Your destiny can wait.\nDOCTOR: Mission of the Viyrans, by Colin Brake A Big Finish Productions Dr Who Audio Drama, released Nov 2007\nVIYRAN: (a machine voice) Memory zero. Negative. Reset.\nPERI: (gasps) Hello? Anybody there?\nPERI: Nice night. Party too much for you? Contemplating jumping in? Hey!\nDOCTOR: Oh! Sorry, I didn't hear you. Er, well, yes. I thought it best to leave you having a good time.\nPERI: You were miles away there. What were you thinking about?\nDOCTOR: Thinking about? Er... That's odd, actually. I don't seem to remember.\nPERI: Ha! That's old age for you.\nDOCTOR: Old age. That's old age for you.\nPERI: Er, that's what I just said, Doctor. You sure you're okay?\nDOCTOR: Okay. Peri.\nPERI: That's me.\nDOCTOR: Peri, something's wrong. I feel...\nPERI: Whoa! Hey! It's all right. You were the one who warned me about the Grallistan punch.\nDOCTOR: Grallistan punch.\nPERI: Punch, yeah. Whoa, you really are the worse for wear.\nDOCTOR: Old age. Party too much. Miles away.\nPERI: Let me remind you, it was your idea to come here. You said I needed to relax and enjoy myself, after...\nDOCTOR: Miles... away!\nPERI: What the hell's happening? Doctor! Somebody help me! Hey! Oh, I don't believe it.\nDOCTOR: Don't...\nPERI: 2: ... Believe it.\nPERI: What? No, this can't be happening.\nPERI: 2: Miles away.\nPERI: No ... Doctor!\nPERI: 2: Miles away.\nPERI: Doctor, where are you? What the hell is going on? (echoes)\nVIYRAN: Recall and delete. It was night. The Doctor was standing on a small wooden bridge looking into a stream. At first he did not notice when you spoke to him. When he did, he seemed distracted, confused. You thought he was intoxicated. Then he began to collapse and repeat the words you had spoken to him. Before your eyes his face changed into an exact replica of your face.\nPERI: (gasps) Hello? Anyone there? Anyone feel like maybe turning a light on?\nVIYRAN: There is no light.\nPERI: Right. Okay. I kinda gathered that.\nVIYRAN: There is no light that you can see.\nPERI: Okay. Got that. Thanks.\nVIYRAN: There is light that you cannot see, beyond your visual spectrum.\nPERI: Well, thanks for pointing that out. Er...\nVIYRAN: What do you remember?\nPERI: I’m not sure what you mean.\nVIYRAN: What were you just remembering?\nPERI: Well, I was... I was asleep, wasn't I?\nVIYRAN: No.\nPERI: But I must have been.\nVIYRAN: Why do you say that?\nPERI: Because I think I was dreaming that... Actually, that's none of your business. Dreams are private, and - and who are you, anyway?\nVIYRAN: Don't you remember?\nPERI: Am I supposed to?\nPERI: 2: Don't you remember?\nPERI: But... where am I?\nPERI: 2: Don't you remember?\nPERI: Who are you?\nPERI: 2: I need you to answer the question.\nPERI: You sound like me. Is it a trick? What's going on?\nVIYRAN: Is it a trick?\nPERI: 2: Is it a trick?\nVIYRAN: A trick?\nPERI: 2: A trick? A trick?\nPERI: Stop it! Why are you playing a trick on me?\nPERI: 2: I want to know what you remember.\nPERI: Are you just trying to freak me out or something?\nVIYRAN: Is that better? Are you less freaked out now?\nPERI: Yes, I guess.\nVIYRAN: Do you remember this happening before?\nPERI: Why? Has it happened before?\nVIYRAN: Tell us what you were remembering before you said...\nPERI: [recording]: Hello? Anyone there?\nPERI: Don't do that.\nVIYRAN: Please be honest. It is the only way for us to be sure.\nPERI: Us? Who are you? And why do you keep pretending to be me?\nVIYRAN: We are not pretending to be you. We are the Viyrans.\nPERI: Viyrans?\nVIYRAN: And there is a matter of urgency. Did you remember the Doctor?\nPERI: The Doctor? What do you know about the Doctor?\nVIYRAN: Please answer the question.\nPERI: What if I don't?\nVIYRAN: Please answer the question. Very well. You leave us no choice.\nPERI: What do you mean’? Is that a threat? Hello?\nPERI: What's that? Is that you? What are you doing? Will you give me some answers, for...\nPERI: Hey. Hey! I need some help out here. l...\nPERI: What happened here? Anybody awake? What's the matter? You can't all just have... Chris. Chris, wake up!\nCHRIS: What's the ... what's the matter?\nPERI: Oh, thank God. I don't know, Chris. Something really weird just happened out there with the Doctor. You remember the Doctor, right?\nCHRIS: What happened here?\nPERI: I don't know. How come everyone just... well, flaked out? Was it too much punch, or...?\nCHRIS: Anybody awake?\nPERI: No, not as far as I can tell, apart from you. Anyway, you've gotta come with me. I don't even know if what I saw was - I don't know - real. Oh, come on, Chris, get up, will you?\nPERI: Chris?\nCHRIS: Chris. Chris, wake up.\nPERI: What?\nCHRIS: Chris. Chris.\nPERI: Oh no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Please, this cannot be happening.\nMAN: 1: Wake up.\nMAN: 2: Wake up.\nPERI: No, stop it. Stop it.\nMAN: Stop it.\nPEOPLE: No. Stop it. (repeating)\nPERI: No! No!\nPERI: (gasps) What's going on? Tell me, whoever you are. You know something. Stop playing games and just...\nVIYRAN: You were remembering something.\nPERI: Was I?\nVIYRAN: Your brain activity indicated you were remembering something. We must know what you were remembering.\nPERI: If you're monitoring my brain somehow, can't you tell me? Or aren't you that smart?\nVIYRAN: We are not that smart. We cannot read minds. That is not our purpose.\nPERI: Then what is your purpose? I have a right to know.\nVIYRAN: We are not concerned with your rights. There is a matter of urgency. You are remembering incidents and we need to know what they are.\nPERI: Why?\nVIYRAN: It is better if you do not know.\nPERI: Oh, really? Why?\nVIYRAN: It would be simpler if you trusted us.\nPERI: Simpler for you, you mean.\nVIYRAN: Simpler and better for many.\nPERI: Many? Like who?\nVIYRAN: We will not answer such questions.\nPERI: Why not? Okay, I admit it. I remembered something.\nVIYRAN: Yes. We know that. But we must know what it was.\nPERI: And if I don't tell you you'll hurt me again, right? Can't you see that there's no way I'm going to trust you if you threaten me. You have to earn my trust.\nVIYRAN: Tell us the first thing you remembered before you said...\nPERI: [recording]: Hello? Anybody there?\nPERI: All right. Well, I was at a party on Grallista Social. I noticed the Doctor had left the party and...\nVIYRAN: (speeded up) Recall and delete. It was night. The Doctor was standing on a small wooden bridge looking into a stream. At first he did not notice when you spoke to him. When he did, he seemed distracted, confused. You thought he was intoxicated. Then he began to collapse and repeat the words you had spoken to him. Before your eyes his face changed into an exact replica of your face.\nPERI: (distant, echoes) No, Doctor!\nPERI: Who are you people?\nVIYRAN: We told you. We are the Viyrans. There is a matter of urgency. To tell you more would be to build significant new memories. We must not do that.\nPERI: Significant? Will you tell me how you knew what I remembered?\nVIYRAN: Very well. This will be our one concession to engender your trust. We knew of your memory because you have told us of it before.\nPERI: When?\nVIYRAN: Precisely three hundred and thirty seven times previous to this treatment period.\nPERI: Three hundred and...?\nVIYRAN: Will you trust us now, Peri?\nPERI: It's a treatment?\nVIYRAN: What is the next thing you remember, Peri? Memory is not always chronological.\nPERI: I remember... Erimem. I remember her.\nVIYRAN: That memory is permitted.\nPERI: Permitted?\nVIYRAN: What is the next thing you remember relating to the planet Grallista Social?\nPERI: Okay. I... I went back into the party hut to get help, and when I got there everyone was ... I don't know, lying down - unconscious, I guess. I woke Chris up. He spoke, but then...\nVIYRAN: Please continue, Peri.\nPERI: I'm not sure I can remember what happened next. It was weird. I mean, I remember remembering it, if you see what I mean, like a dream you remember having, but you can't quite...\nVIYRAN: And the next thing you remember?\nPERI: Something... something about having a son. Kyle? No, but that's not true. Is it?\nVIYRAN: We don't know. That is for you to decide.\nPERI: So... maybe this stuff about Grallista Social and the Doctor changing, changing into me - I mean, it's just crazy. Maybe that's not true either. Dracula! I remember Dracula, we lost the Tardis, and - and...\nVIYRAN: Concentrate on Grallista Social. What happened when you first arrived on Grallista Social?\nMAN: 1: Did you go to the last one?\nMAN: 2: Yeah, it was fantastic.\nPERI: Grallista Social? (laughs) They actually called this planet Social?\nDOCTOR: Well, that way everyone knows what to expect when they come here.\nPERI: Socialising. Hmm. I'm not sure if I'm in the mood for socialising.\nDOCTOR: I know. Which is precisely why we should come here and socialise. We've had enough heartache lately. Time to unwind.\nPERI: Nobody here seems particularly fazed by a blue box appearing out of nowhere, do they?\nDOCTOR: Nothing seems to faze anyone on Grallista Social. Take a leaf out of their book, Peri. Relax, have a nice time, meet new people. And just wait till you've tasted the infamous Grallistan punch.\nDOCTOR: You haven't tasted it yet.\nPERI: No, it's not... (coughs) that. Ugh. I think I've just swallowed a fly or something.\nDOCTOR: Oh. I don't see any flies.\nPERI: Mmm, maybe not. It felt like something hit the back of my throat, like it shot in there really fast. It feels numb. The sensation's kind of fading now. (muffled) Yeah. Think it's okay. Weird.\nPERI: I remember the bright light.\nPERI: Ah! No. It hurts.\nVIYRAN: Try to forget the light.\nPERI: Chris's face. Everyone's face. The Doctor, everyone. They all started to look just like me. It was like a nightmare. I wanted to wake up, get away. I ran out of the hut, there... there was this, this car thing, I got in it, I pushed every button, and it started to move. I found the accelerator, I drove as fast as I could. I thought I was going mad. The lights of the party were a long way behind me. I didn't know where I was going, what I was trying to get away from. I was just terrified. Then suddenly my headlights caught somebody.\nLAWRENCE: Hey!\nPERI: I'm sorry. Sorry. Are you okay?\nLAWRENCE: I, yeah. No bones broken, I think.\nPERI: I'm sorry.\nLAWRENCE: You said. Where have you come from?\nPERI: Er, where? Er, well, one of the party huts.\nLAWRENCE: Out west?\nPERI: I think so. I'm not sure.\nLAWRENCE: Then it's happened there too.\nPERI: What? What's happened?\nLAWRENCE: Well, I assumed you were trying to get away, the speed you were driving.\nPERI: I was, but how did you...? Were you trying to get away too?\nLAWRENCE: From the space pad, yeah. What are you looking at?\nPERI: Er, nothing. It's just good to see a friendly face, that's all. A different face.\nLAWRENCE: Do you know who they were? Hey, wait a minute. Listen.\nPERI: It's coming from that direction, from the party huts where I came from.\nPERI: Whoa!\nLAWRENCE: What was that?\nPERI: I don't know. It was moving too fast. Fast, and, I don't know, shiny. Something fast and shiny, glowing.\nLAWRENCE: And flying. Look out!\nPERI: Ah! They're heading in the direction you were coming from.\nLAWRENCE: They must be connected to those creatures in some way.\nPERI: Creatures? What... what creatures?\nLAWRENCE: At the space pad. I thought that's who you were trying to get away from.\nPERI: Creatures? No. Well, I, I don't know if you'd call them that exactly.\nLAWRENCE: What would you call them, then? Look out!\nPERI: Wait a minute. Look. They look like... like there are people inside whatever they are.\nLAWRENCE: Like coffins.\nPERI: Coffins?\nLAWRENCE: Flying glass coffins.\nPERI: What's your name?\nLAWRENCE: Lawrence, actually. Pleased to meet you.\nPERI: Peri.\nLAWRENCE: Peri. Hi. Sorry, should have done that earlier, I suppose.\nPERI: Lawrence, something seriously weird is going on here. And... well, to tell you the truth, I feel kind of like I'm going insane. So will you do me a real favour, Lawrence, and tell me what you saw at the space pad. Lawrence?\nLAWRENCE: That.\nPERI: What?\nLAWRENCE: Behind you. That's what I saw.\nPERI: And these are the creatures you were talking about?\nLAWRENCE: These are the creatures.\nPERI: Do you know who they are?\nLAWRENCE: Are the creatures.\nPERI: I know, but do you know who...?\nPERI: Please, no. (cries) Get away from me. Keep away!\nPERI: 2: These are the creatures.\nPERI: No!\nPERI: Let me out of this thing. Who are you?\nPERI: Stop making that noise.\nPERI: 2: Language assimilated.\nPERI: That's my voice.\nPERI: 2: We have been searching for you. You are Patient Zero.\nPERI: Patient? Stop speaking with my voice.\nPERI: 2: Your language has been assimilated through a recording of your voice. We have never encountered your species before.\nPERI: Change the voice. It's creepy. Looking at you but hearing me? I... I don't like it.\nVIYRAN: Is this sufficiently different?\nPERI: I guess so. Who are you? What are you? Is that a spacesuit? Is there someone inside?\nVIYRAN: We are the Viyrans. You are Patient Zero.\nPERI: What do you mean by Patient Zero?\nVIYRAN: Have we not assimilated your language correctly? Vocalisation is not easy for us. We are achieving it artificially. We have no vocal language.\nPERI: But Patient Zero? I mean... I understand the term, but - well, it means the first person infected by something.\nVIYRAN: Then you understand.\nPERI: Oh, really? That's a bit of a leap.\nVIYRAN: It is not necessary for you to understand fully. You must be cured, and the memory of this incident expunged.\nPERI: Cured of what? Oh! No! Oh, turn that light off, it's hurting me! No! Please! No!\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. Hello. It's Chris, isn't it?\nCHRIS: Er, yeah. Oh, you're Peri's friend, aren't you, the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's right. You've seen her, then?\nCHRIS: Well, not since last night. All a bit hectic last night.\nDOCTOR: Hectic, was it?\nCHRIS: Well, I mean, it was a great party, wasn't it? You were there, weren't you? I seem to remember seeing you.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but I left early. Are you sure it was only last night?\nCHRIS: What do you mean? Course it was only last night. Why do you ask?\nDOCTOR: Er, I don't know. Just seems longer ago.\nCHRIS: Oh, that'll be the punch.\nDOCTOR: Yeah. Oh yes, of course, the punch, yes, hmm.\nCHRIS: I should get back to bed if I were you, sleep it off.\nDOCTOR: I must say, I feel fully rested. It's just that...\nCHRIS: Just what?\nDOCTOR: Have you seen Peri this morning? We'd arranged to meet, and, well, I'm worried about her.\nCHRIS: Oh. Well, last thing I remember, she’d left the party to see where you'd gone, said she'd drag you back. Didn't see her again.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nCHRIS: Didn't she find you?\nDOCTOR: Er, I'm afraid I don't know.\nCHRIS: Well, she couldn't have done, could she, if you're looking for her?\nDOCTOR: No, no, I suppose not.\nCHRIS: Look, Doctor, there's another party tonight. Mind if I give you some advice?\nDOCTOR: Not at all, Chris.\nCHRIS: I'd give it a miss if I were you. Settle yourself down with a nice cup of chocolate and a boring book.\nVIYRAN: Memory zero, negative. You have remembered more, again.\nPERI: Wait a minute. You're trying to make me forget something, right?\nVIYRAN: The memory must be expunged.\nPERI: Because you want me to have as little as possible to forget?\nVIYRAN: It is unfortunate. Two of you must be expunged.\nPERI: Expunged? You mean you're going to kill me? Stop it, wait!\nVIYRAN: Do you wish to cooperate with us?\nPERI: Of course I do, if the alternative is you killing me. And what did you mean, two of us have to be expunged?\nVIYRAN: The one you call the Doctor. His mind is more complex than yours. There is a point zero zero zero zero one zero memory fragment that is permissible if there is a memory zero patient present, whose lack of memory will prevent memory stimulation. But if you are not present, there is too high a risk of the Doctor rebuilding his memory. He must therefore also be expunged.\nPERI: The trouble is that I don't even understand what it is I'm supposed not to remember, if you see what I mean.\nVIYRAN: After neutralisation and inoculation was completed, we attempted three hundred and thirty eight times to achieve memory zero.\nPERI: Well, hey, why stop now? You've obviously been having such fun.\nVIYRAN: For the last one hundred and eleven attempts, your memory has rebuilt itself further.\nPERI: You mean, I end up remembering more than I did when you started.\nVIYRAN: During the first two hundred and twenty seven attempts, your memory decreased significantly, but since then, it has started to increase. Our time here is limited. Further attempts are clearly pointless and would serve only to provoke total recall.\nPERI: I see.\nVIYRAN: Therefore you must be expunged.\nPERI: Wait. I've got an idea.\nVIYRAN: There is not much time. The matter is urgent.\nPERI: Did I ever understand what had happened to me?\nVIYRAN: No, not fully. The explanations were outside your frame of reference, and we sought to preserve those areas of ignorance.\nPERI: Well, that's it, then. Because I never understood what had happened in the first place, I was left with too many nagging questions in my mind. Each time you tried to assess how much memory had been removed, I started trying to work out what had happened and what I'd forgotten.\nVIYRAN: I do not understand the point you are making.\nPERI: I think I have to want to forget.\nDOCTOR: Peri. How long have you been here?\nPERI: Are you okay? You look worried.\nDOCTOR: What? No, well...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I am worried. I thought you were... I don't know what I thought. Are you all right?\nPERI: Course I'm all right. We said we'd meet back here in the Tardis, didn't we?\nDOCTOR: Did we? Yes, I suppose we did.\nPERI: Well then, here we are, then. What did you get up to last night?\nDOCTOR: Last night?\nPERI: After you left the party.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure it was last night?\nPERI: Er, yeah. Doctor, are you sure you didn't have any of that punch?\nDOCTOR: Peri, what exactly happened the last time you saw me?\nPERI: Nice night. Party too much for you? Contemplating jumping in? Hey!\nDOCTOR: Oh! Sorry, I didn't hear you. Er, well, yes. I thought it best to leave you having a good time.\nPERI: You were miles away there. What were you thinking about?\nDOCTOR: Thinking about? Er... That's odd, actually. I don't seem to remember.\nPERI: Ha! That's old age for you.\nDOCTOR: You know, I think it probably is. I think I might go back to the Tardis, if you don't mind.\nPERI: I promised Chris I'd drag you back in there.\nDOCTOR: Er, I think Chris would be happier if he could drag you back in there.\nPERI: Hmm. Maybe.\nDOCTOR: See you back at the Tardis tomorrow morning. Have fun.\nDOCTOR: And that's what happened?\nPERI: That's what happened.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nPERI: Yeah, sure, why?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. To tell you the truth, I can't even remember why I brought it up. Did you enjoy yourself last night?\nPERI: I had a great time, really great, but...\nDOCTOR: But what?\nPERI: (sighs) I still feel, well, kinda sad.\nDOCTOR: Ah. You mean Erimem.\nPERI: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Do you honestly think she'd have wanted us to be sad?\nPERI: No, I guess not.\nDOCTOR: I'm not suggesting it'll be easy, it never is, but there's a whole universe of Time and Space out there, waiting for us. Well?\nPERI: I'm ready to leave if you are.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nDOCTOR: Let's go, then.\nVIYRAN: We come from another galaxy, a galaxy that has known only war for millennia. But finally the fighting was over. Finally the treaty was signed for the cessation of all biological warfare. During the decommissioning there was an accident. Countless viruses and biological agents engineered for every conceivable purpose were released and scattered across the cosmos. Particles carrying disease and death in a myriad of forms, spreading ever outward across the stars.\nVIYRAN: One such particle entered the atmosphere of Grallista Social - an invisible mutagenic particle - and you, Peri, became Patient Zero, infected by it.\nDOCTOR: You haven't tasted it yet.\nPERI: No, it's not... (coughs) that. Ugh. I think I've just swallowed a fly or something.\nVIYRAN: The virus copies the host DNA, and when it has finished this process it transmits through particles breathed out of Patient Zero's lungs. It attempts to mutate the DNA of the victim into that of Patient Zero, then transmits rapidly from victim to victim, spreading across entire worlds in a matter of days. The genetic mutation is crude and destructive. As a result, after the initial mutation, each victim dies a slow and painful death.\nPERI: Did you... did you save them? All those people I saw. The Doctor?\nVIYRAN: Yes. Our purpose is to track down and neutralise every single particle of those deadly viruses, and expunge all knowledge of our terrible mistake.\nPERI: So you're a kind of biological clean-up team?\nVIYRAN: No one must ever possess the knowledge to produce such weapons again. We owe that to the cosmos. We now have no more time here. We are called to another incursion.\nPERI: You people are doing this all the time then, all across the universe.\nVIYRAN: That is why you and the Doctor must be expunged.\nPERI: I can forget this. I can see how important it is. I... I want to forget it. I mean it.\nVIYRAN: Then we will try to achieve memory zero, one last time."
