      "searchable_dialogue": "DARWIN: September the nineteenth, eighteen hundred and thirty five. Upon our return to the Beagle, our immediate task was to prepare suitable lodgings for our guest, Miss Evelyn Smythe. Of the mysterious submarine lights observed by Miss Smythe there was no was no further sight. Upon retiring to my cabin, I found myself unable to sleep, the discoveries of the day still weighing heavily in my mind. I have spent some hours cataloguing recent samples\nDARWIN: Enter!\nEVELYN: Your light was on. I'm not disturbing you, am I?\nDARWIN: Of course, you must be concerned about the Doctor. Please, do sit down.\nEVELYN: I dare say he'll turn up when we least expect it. He has a habit of doing that.\nDARWIN: I admire your confidence. We shall return to Chatham Island first thing in the morning and search for your friend.\nEVELYN: What is this you're up to?\nDARWIN: I'm er, I was trying to catalogue the finches obtained yesterday. It seems each variety is peculiar to each island.\nEVELYN: They all look the same to me.\nDARWIN: No, no, no, no. You see the graduation in the beaks? One could almost imagine the same creature had been taken and modified for different ends on each island.\nEVELYN: Like the tortoises.\nDARWIN: Quite, yes, yes. It is most remarkable. Each island seems to be possessed of its own distinct set of species, each isolated from the others by many miles of ocean. I believe. No. No, I am certain that I have observed a case of species modification. That as the finches have adapted to each island, so their form has changed as the result of subtle variations in the island's climate and the land.\nEVELYN: You mean they're different because the islands are different.\nDARWIN: Precisely. But what worries me is the notion that there could be an explanation for the diversity of the species other than that of God's will. You know that Lyell claims that geology is not the result of supernatural intervention.\nEVELYN: Yes, but I\nDARWIN: What, what if the same hold true for nature? Perhaps life is not immutable, moulded and set by divinity. Perhaps God's hand has not created this variation I see. Perhaps, perhaps it is instead the result of the natural order.\nGRETA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nGRETA: Doctor, is that you? It's so dark\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?\nGRETA: My head. I feel like I have died. What has happened to us?\nDOCTOR: That was an energy resonator. A crude and rather painful method of rendering your subject unconscious.\nGRETA: I do not understand your words. But if you understand, that is enough. What is this place?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure. Hmm, judging by the air pressure we're some considerable depth below sea level. I rather think we've exchanged one prison cell for another. Caged up like canaries. Hello. And it seems we're not alone.\nGRETA: Emilio!\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Emilio, can you hear us?\nEMILIO: [OC]: Who, who are you? Devils, I saw them.\nGRETA: [OC]: Emilio, it's all right. Please. I'm here. It's all right.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Listen to me, Emilio.\nDOCTOR: You are feeling very sleepy. You're at home, in your bed, and outside is darkness.\nEMILIO: I am at home.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nEMILIO: In my bed.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Let yourself rest. Let yourself drift into a deep sleep.\nEMILIO: But I, I, oh, so tired.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nGRETA: What did you do?\nDOCTOR: I've induced a mild hypnotic trance to help calm him down. Poor fellow, he's had a considerable psychic shock.\nGRETA: Will he be all right?\nDOCTOR: Given time.\nGRETA: The devils he mentioned, they were real. We saw them.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nGRETA: Doctor\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, we did. But, well, they weren't devils. They were Silurians.\nGRETA: Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Mmm, yeah. An ancient race that ruled the Earth while humanity was still in its infancy, many hundreds of thousands of years ago. A race of great scientific knowledge\nDOCTOR: [OC]: And a highly sophisticated civilisation. They built vast cities, tamed\nSH'VAK: Tulok, the ape creature called the Doctor. It seems to have heard of our people.\nTULOK: But that is impossible, Sh'vak. None of the other apes have known about us. How can this one have knowledge the others do not?\nSH'VAK: You know what this means. Perhaps these creatures have met us before.\nTULOK: But how? None of the other Silurian clans survived. We are the only ones left.\nSH'VAK: But how else could this creature have heard of us?\nTULOK: If it does know about us, Sh'vak, then it will be dangerous. I shall have it slaughtered.\nSH'VAK: No, Tulok. This ape creature could be useful.\nTULOK: Useful?\nSH'VAK: We need to find out how it knows about our people. We must learn more about these creatures, whether they could threaten our plans.\nTULOK: You will be allowed to question it.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Then there was a catastrophe. Within a matter of years, the surface of the planet became quite unsuitable for life. The seas boiled,\nDOCTOR: Turned to acid and terrible storms blacked out the skies. The world was a desolate, poisonous wasteland.\nGRETA: But if that is so, how can they be here now?\nDOCTOR: The Silurians decided to put themselves into hibernation, in bunkers hidden deep underground, intending to sleep out the disaster and wait for the planet to heal itself. Once it had recovered, they would then return to the surface.\nGRETA: But?\nDOCTOR: But they overslept.\nGRETA: Ah.\nDOCTOR: Years passed, and the Earth not only healed itself, it blossomed. Nature covered the globe once more, filling every corner with new species of plants and animals. While the Silurians remained dormant, the world above was reborn. The lifeless planet they had abandoned was transformed into the world you live in today.\nGRETA: Why did they not wake up?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure. Perhaps they forgot to set their alarm clocks. Careless, really.\nGRETA: And now they have come back.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, they have come back.\nGRETA: Emilio? What have they done to him?\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid he has reverted to the level of his primitive ancestors.\nEVELYN: This mist never lets up, does it? Brr. Oh, are you all right with those oars, Charles? You look as though you didn't get any sleep at all last night.\nDARWIN: It has been preying on my mind. The change in the birds' behaviour. I have observed elsewhere the effect an introduced predator can have on an aboriginal species. It seems that in this case the birds have acquired a fear of their new predator.\nEVELYN: You mean man.\nDARWIN: Quite. But birds are not clever creatures. They do not learn. One might be captured by the same method day after day. They do not confer or teach their young. The arrival of man has changed their behaviour, yes, but how?\nEVELYN: And?\nDARWIN: Well, it occurs to me that in a population of birds they have some that are more timid than others. The variety that are bold will quickly be killed, which means only those which are most cautious will be the ones who will breed.\nEVELYN: Of course.\nDARWIN: And it would appear that the progeny of these birds retain that timidity. Somehow that characteristic is transferred from one generation to the next. until eventually the entire population consists of those who've inherited that aspect.\nEVELYN: That's very clever.\nDARWIN: It resembles the process of domestication, but in reverse. Rather than breeding the tamest of horses or cattle, we have a process which favours those which have an instinctive fear. That instinct becomes predominant. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be worried about your friend. You don't want to have me boring you with my theories of nature.\nEVELYN: Oh, not at all, Charles. Not at all.\nDOCTOR: Each of us, deep down, retains certain experiences from previous generations on a subconscious level. A race memory, if you like.\nGRETA: And Emilio is remembering?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well, no. No, more than that. Many centuries ago humanity was very different from how it is now. Mankind was essentially a species of apes. A very special type called Australopithecus, but apes nonetheless. And for Emilio, well, the clock has been turned back.\nGRETA: No, I won't believe it.\nDOCTOR: I've seen it before, and the most powerful emotion he is feeling is fear. A huge, overriding fear of these creatures, the Silurians, buried deep into the instinct. The shock must have brought that fear to the surface and caused centuries of progress to unravel.\nGRETA: But that is horrible!\nDOCTOR: But not, I hope, irreversible. Emilio? Can you hear me?\nGRETA: Emilio? Say something, please.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. Concentrate on my voice.\nEMILIO: Oh, oh, who.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nEMILIO: Who is, who is that? Where, where am I?\nDOCTOR: I'm here to help you. I am the Doctor. I have Greta with me.\nEMILIO: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now, I want you to think back. You are a fisherman. You live in Baquerizo Moreno.\nEMILIO: I, I remember. Yes.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now, I want you to go back to the last thing you remember. Where are you?\nEMILIO: I am by the lake, El Junco.\nDOCTOR: What time is it?\nEMILIO: It's midday. The sun is bright. It is so hot. I have brought my nets ashore to dry. But\nDOCTOR: What? What is it?\nEMILIO: There is a cave. I have not seen it before. It is so dark, so black.\nDOCTOR: You want to cool off. Go inside the cave.\nEMILIO: No! I see! There are creatures in there! They are devils, with three eyes! They have found me!\nDOCTOR: Emilio, the fear that you feel, I want you to put it in the back of your mind. Put the fear in the darkness where it belongs.\nEMILIO: It's so dark.\nDOCTOR: Now step out into the light. Into the light. Now, wake up. (snaps fingers) Wake up.\nGRETA: Emilio, are you all right?\nEMILIO: (crying) Greta, where am I?\nSH'VAK: Doctor, come with me.\nDARWIN: Careful, the wood is very slippery. Hold on while I secure the boat.\nEVELYN: Oh, I'm rather getting the hang of this. Where is everybody?\nDARWIN: Either out in their boats or in their homes. This is not a hospitable country. People keep to themselves. (walking) Evelyn, what we were discussing earlier about the birds' behaviour.\nEVELYN: Yes, you said how they could become more wild.\nDARWIN: Perhaps the process may also favour other differences within a species. If a larger beak means a bird can eat more food, then in times of shortage that bird may survive when others may not, and that advantage would be carried on into further generations.\nEVELYN: Which would explain why the birds on each island are slightly different, I suppose.\nDARWIN: Yes. A small change in the environment may give rise to a new variety, better equipped for survival as the rest are driven to extinction.\nEVELYN: A sort of survival of the fittest.\nDARWIN: What an odd expression. Obviously the most fittest are suited to survive, that's what fittest means. No, no, it is more of a descent, with modification.\nDOCTOR: And this would be the no, no, don't tell me, kitchen? Not sure about the work surfaces, I must say. Ah, wait. It's your laboratory, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: Very good. But they so often are, aren't they.\nSH'VAK: I wish to speak to you. Sit here.\nDOCTOR: Oh hello, what's this? You've been augmenting bacterial cultures. This is most fascinating.\nSH'VAK: Sit down, Doctor, or you will be forced to.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh well, if you say so. Here? Oh, not very comfortable, but I suppose I could get used Ah! Oh! Ah!\nDOCTOR: It's all right, I wasn't going anywhere. Are you in charge here?\nSH'VAK: I am Primary Scientist Sh'vak. Our leader, Tulok, will join us soon.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak, I would shake your hand but unfortunately. So how can I help you?\nSH'VAK: We have observed your conversation in the enclosure.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I thought you seemed remarkably well-informed.\nSH'VAK: You seem to know a great deal about us, too.\nDOCTOR: Do I? Yes, yes, I suppose I do. One tries.\nSH'VAK: We are the only survivors of our people. We had not made our presence known. So how could you possibly have heard of us?\nDOCTOR: You are the only survivors? Is that what you believe?\nSH'VAK: Yes. All of the others were destroyed during the Great Hibernation.\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid not, Sh'vak. You're right, most of your people were lost. Most, but not all. Some did survive, in small isolated pockets throughout the globe.\nSH'VAK: And you have met these survivors?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well, er, no. Well, yes, but not yet.\nSH'VAK: Do all of you ape creatures know of our race?\nDOCTOR: Ape creatures? (sighs) Human beings. No, they don't.\nSH'VAK: That is good. If they knew of our existence they could pose a threat.\nDOCTOR: Pose a threat? Oh, for goodness' sake. Look, you're not\nSH'VAK: This is our home, Doctor. The ape creatures are an infestation.\nDOCTOR: Those ape creatures are as entitled to the world as you are.\nSH'VAK: They are vermin that have overrun our planet\nDOCTOR: The planet you abandoned! You can't just leave a world unoccupied for a hundred thousand years and expect it to remain unchanged. Nature abhors a vacuum.\nSH'VAK: We were here first.\nDOCTOR: We were here first? Oh, that's the basis for your argument, isn't it. This isn't a game of musical chairs, you know. Why do you always need to destroy rival species? Why can't you try to share the Earth? It's big enough for both of you.\nSH'VAK: Doctor, if the situations were reversed, would the ape creatures be prepared to share the world with us? I don't think so. They have no qualms about annihilating inferior races, nor should we.\nDOCTOR: But don't you see? A peaceful solution is the only solution. If you declare war, then the humans will simply\nTULOK: Yes, Doctor? What will the humans do?\nDOCTOR: Ah, you would be Tulok, I presume?\nTULOK: Indeed.\nTULOK: You will tell us about the ape creature. You will tell us about their weapons and their technology. And then, armed with that knowledge, we shall exterminate them.\nMAN: Governor. Two of the people from the boat to see you.\nLAWSON: Well, show them in, man.\nLAWSON: Ah, Mister Darwin and Miss Smythe, isn't it? Please, do come in.\nEVELYN: Governor Lawson, I'll come straight to the point.\nLAWSON: Of course, of course. You must be worried about your companion, the Doctor.\nDARWIN: That's right. Has there been any sight of him?\nLAWSON: I'm afraid I do not have much to tell. He did not return to the meeting house. My guards searched throughout the night but with no success, alas.\nEVELYN: But he must be somewhere. The Doctor has many qualities, but being inconspicuous is certainly not one of them.\nLAWSON: If the Doctor were here, my guards would have found him.\nEVELYN: Maybe your guards aren't as efficient as you think. Come on, Charles. I don't think we're going to get anywhere here.\nDARWIN: Evelyn.\nLAWSON: I regret I cannot be of more assistance. Of course, should the Doctor surface\nEVELYN: Somehow I think we've got a better chance of finding him ourselves.\nLAWSON: You are of course welcome to conduct your own search. Now, if you will do me the courtesy, good day to you. Good day.\nTULOK: You are from the marine transport?\nDOCTOR: Marine? Oh, you mean the Beagle. So you've noticed that the people from the ship are different to the natives of the island. That's interesting.\nSH'VAK: They are scientists, like you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. How'd you know that? Of course, it's Lawson, isn't it? The Governor of the island. Been keeping you up to date with the local gossip, has he?\nTULOK: We have observed the marine transport.\nDOCTOR: And you're controlling him by some sort of post-hypnotic instruction, I should imagine. One of the uses for that third eye of yours.\nTULOK: It affords us a certain influence over primitive lifeforms. The marine transport, does it carry any weaponry?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Tulok, you really are a very tiresome fellow.\nTULOK: Doctor, you will tell us what we want to know. What weapons are on the marine transport?\nDOCTOR: They have projectile weapons based on chemical explosives, that is all.\nTULOK: So, the apes are fairly industrialised. Do they know anything of genetics? Nuclear fusion?\nDOCTOR: (in pain) No, don't. I, no. No, I'm afraid you've woken up a century and a half too early for that.\nTULOK: Good. They will not be able to offer us any resistance.\nDOCTOR: You're wrong. In the end, they will fight you and they will win. Argh!\nTULOK: They are not capable.\nDOCTOR: Please, please, listen to me. Make peace with the humans. It is the only way.\nTULOK: No. The Earth will be ours.\nSILURIAN: [OC]: Leader Tulok.\nTULOK: Yes?\nSILURIAN: [OC]: A radio communication.\nDOCTOR: Lawson, I should expect. If he asks you out to dinner, bearing in mind his preferred menu, my advice is to politely decline.\nTULOK: Sh'vak, continue with the interrogation.\nDARWIN: Where are we going? And why did you speak to the Governor like that?\nEVELYN: Oh, I don't think our friend Governor Lawson is all he seems.\nDARWIN: What do you mean?\nEVELYN: At what point last night did you notice that the Doctor had gone missing?\nDARWIN: I'm not sure. It was late. Shortly before we were due to leave. I don't see how\nEVELYN: It was after Lawson had already left the meeting house. He couldn't have known that the Doctor had gone, so\nDARWIN: My word, you're right. So how did he know that we'd come back to look for him unless\nEVELYN: Unless he already knew what had happened to the Doctor.\nDARWIN: You think his guards have found him.\nEVELYN: I'm sure of it.\nDARWIN: So where are we going now?\nEVELYN: Up there. The jail house.\nLAWSON: [OC]: Masters.\nTULOK: Speak, Lawson.\nLAWSON: [OC]: There were two people here, from the boat. They were asking about the Doctor. I managed to convince them that I didn't know where he was, I think, but they are getting suspicious.\nTULOK: You think they could threaten our plans?\nLAWSON: [OC]: I do, yes.\nTULOK: They will be destroyed.\nEMILIO: Greta. Greta, where are we?\nGRETA: The Doctor said we were far underground.\nEMILIO: And the devils I saw?\nGRETA: The Doctor knows about them. Don't worry. There's nothing to fear.\nDARWIN: I don't understand. Where are all the guards?\nEVELYN: You'd think they'd bother to lock the front door, unless the reputation of the place is enough to keep the people out. Or\nDARWIN: It doesn't make any sense. A jail house with no guards, unlocked doors?\nEVELYN: And no prisoners. Look.\nDARWIN: All of the cells are empty. That's ridiculous. This island, this whole place, is a prison.\nEVELYN: [OC]: So where have they all gone?\nDARWIN: [OC]: Well, maybe your friend the Doctor isn't here.\nEVELYN: [OC]: These marks on the walls. They continue into the cell.\nLAWSON: Go on, go on.\nDARWIN: [OC]: Look out! Get back!\nEVELYN: [OC]: That was close. Nearly took my arm off. Another second and we'd have been stuck in there.\nDARWIN: [OC]: It's locked itself. All the cells, they're all locked. But how?\nEVELYN: [OC]: Automatically. Charles, I think we'd better leave now.\nLAWSON: Yes, Miss Smythe. Why don't you try to do just that.\nSH'VAK: Doctor, you will recover. I have no wish to inflict gratuitous pain.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nSH'VAK: Tell me about the other Silurian clans that survived.\nDOCTOR: Who told you that you were the only ones left? Was it Tulok? How interesting.\nTULOK: [OC]: Sh'vak, the ape creature must be returned to its enclosure.\nSH'VAK: But I have not yet finished my questioning.\nTULOK: [OC]: There is no time. We will be launching an attack on the creature's marine vessel.\nDOCTOR: What? The Beagle? No! No, you mustn't! Help me, Sh'vak. The people on that boat are innocent. You must help me warn them.\nSH'VAK: No, Doctor. There is nothing I can do.\nDARWIN: Oh, my Lord.\nDARWIN: We're shut in.\nEVELYN: So that's why they don't need guards. It's all automated. Somebody must know we're in here. There must be, I don't know, some sort of hidden camera or something.\nDARWIN: Camera? You mean we've been detected? By whom?\nEVELYN: Our friend the Governor, perhaps. Or. Wait. Shh.\nEVELYN: That is just typical. A secret passage.\nDARWIN: Why would somebody build a\nEVELYN: Never mind that, Charles. It's the only way out and we can't stay here. Come on. Now, somewhere in here. Ah. Yes. There we are.\nEVELYN: Steps going down.\nDARWIN: That device you are using, what is it?\nEVELYN: Oh, this? A torch. It works by. Well, don't worry about how it works, just be thankful it does.\nEVELYN: Shall we?\nDARWIN: If you're sure.\nEVELYN: I'm not sure of anything, except that moving is better than staying here waiting for Lawson or whoever to catch up with us.\nDOCTOR: Oh, charming. Oh, Greta. Greta, wake up.\nGRETA: Oh, Doctor, you're alive. What happened to you?\nDOCTOR: The Silurians and I had a little chat. Most instructive. Well, for them at least. But where's Emilio?\nGRETA: Emilio? I, I don't remember. The creatures\nDOCTOR: The Silurians?\nGRETA: Yes, they took him away. But I'm not sure. I fell asleep. What do you think has happened to him?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wish I knew. At the moment I'm also rather concerned about what the Silurians have planned for the Beagle.\nGRETA: Your ship?\nDOCTOR: Silurians are frightened of humans. They pretend not to be, but they are. And because they're scared, that makes them dangerous. Desperate, even.\nGRETA: What do you think they will do?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nGRETA: Oh, what was that? The door is not locked?\nDOCTOR: No, it seems not. That is very odd.\nGRETA: We must get back to your ship and warn them.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Somehow I don't think we're going to get another chance. Come on!\nEVELYN: So, how deep do you think we are?\nDARWIN: A hundred fathoms or more.\nEVELYN: What's that?\nEVELYN: I think it's getting wider up ahead.\nDARWIN: And another thing. These walls, they're smooth. They feel as if they've been mined.\nEVELYN: We might as well get a move on. We can't turn back, and just around the corner\nDARWIN: My Lord! It looks like a mausoleum.\nEVELYN: There must be hundreds of them.\nDARWIN: What could be the purpose of such a place, if not a crypt?\nEVELYN: I don't now. But if it is a tomb, what are all these pipes and valves doing here?\nDARWIN: Some sort of foundry? But the sheer size of it beggars belief.\nEVELYN: Whatever it is, it's giving me the creeps. These coffins are solid stone. Urgh, and they're wet.\nDARWIN: Covered in some sort of algae residue. (sniffs) This is sea water. Perhaps the tomb is inundated at high tide?\nEVELYN: Look, up ahead. I think that coffin is open. Oh, my goodness.\nDARWIN: The smell. There's something in here.\nEVELYN: What is it?\nDARWIN: Some sort of lizard, I think, but it's rotted away almost to a skeleton.\nEVELYN: You have the torch.\nDARWIN: About the size and proportions of a man. Two arms, two legs.\nEVELYN: But you said it was a lizard.\nDARWIN: The flesh has decomposed, but the skin is scaled like an alligator's. The skull is of a strange aspect. There appears to be a socket for a third eye in the central ridge of the forehead. I've never seen anything like it.\nDOCTOR: Quick, this way.\nTULOK: [OC]: The ape creatures have escaped from their enclosure.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. It looks as though we've been missed.\nGRETA: But how will we escape? They have sealed all the ways off.\nDOCTOR: I think. Just hold this. If I can trip the hydraulic servo release. Right, now in here.\nGRETA: Oh, what is this? We're moving!\nDOCTOR: It's a lift. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe. Hopefully this will take us to the surface, if they don't shut us down first.\nTULOK: [OC]: The ape creatures are in the main lift shaft.\nGRETA: Oh no, where are we?\nDOCTOR: Down there, look. Daylight. We've done it. This must be the cave that Emilio mentioned. Come on. I don't think we have time to loose.\nGRETA: All right, all right.\nLOKAN: The two ape creatures have left the cave at El Junco, and are heading towards the settlement. Shall I give the order for them to be recaptured?\nTULOK: No, Lokan. You will allow them to return to their marine vessel.\nLUKAN: I don't understand. You are deliberately allowing them to escape.\nSILURIAN: [OC]: Leader, two more ape creatures have been reported in the hibernation chambers.\nTULOK: What!\nLUKAN: The ape creature Lawson must have allowed them to enter our base.\nTULOK: Lawson is not reliable. He will be disposed of.\nSILURIAN: [OC]: And the ape creatures?\nTULOK: We can always use two more specimens.\nGRETA: Oh, Doctor, the people in the village, should we not warn them about the Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Later. Much later. Down here. Into the boat, quick. Jump. I only hope we can get to them in time.\nDOCTOR: Whatever the Silurians are going to do, it isn't going to be pleasant.\nDARWIN: Well, perhaps the process of descent through modification explains much more than varieties. Might not a variety eventually give rise to a new species?\nEVELYN: You know, Charles, I think you're on to something. What was that?\nEVELYN: Oh, my goodness.\nDOCTOR: Ahoy there! Captain! Captain Fitzroy!\nFITZROY: Doctor, you're back. We were most concerned. And who is that with you?\nDOCTOR: I'll explain later. Can you throw us down a rope ladder?\nFITZROY: My dear sir, whatever has happened to you? Your clothes. You look exhausted.\nDOCTOR: Oh, there's no time. You have to get your men ashore immediately.\nSEAMAN: Captain! Over here, on the port side.\nFITZROY: What is it?\nSEAMAN: There's something in the water.\nFITZROY: What?\nFITZROY: What in the name of Heaven and Earth."

Call your men back, Fitzroy.\nFITZROY: What do you mean, it won't do any good?\nDOCTOR: You're not going to stop a thing like that with bullets. Call your men back! Now!\nFITZROY: What do you propose we do?\nDOCTOR: Get everyone below decks, before they all get killed. Greta, you too. Go now! Run!\nFITZROY: Men, keep back! Keep back!\nDOCTOR: And don't let it touch you, whatever you do. It carries a massive electrical charge.\nFITZROY: The ship can't take much more of this.\nDOCTOR: Quick, do you have anything flammable? Oil?\nFITZROY: We have the supply for the lamps, but\nDOCTOR: This creature comes from the depths of the ocean. It normally lives in near-freezing water, in total darkness.\nFITZROY: How does that help us?\nDOCTOR: It's not used to heat and light. That's what we need right now.\nFITZROY: Heat and light? What?\nDOCTOR: We have to frighten it away. Empty that oil cask over the port side!\nFITZROY: You're trying to set fire to the ocean? You can't be serious.\nDOCTOR: Do it! You don't have any choice.\nFITZROY: You two, do as the Doctor says. That's an order!\nSEAMAN: Yes, sir.\nFITZROY: I hope you know what you're doing, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So do I. (strikes match) Here goes.\nFITZROY: It's not stopping. It's going to tear us to pieces. Doctor!\nDOCTOR: That's strange, the fire should have driven it away. Why hasn't it given up?\nFITZROY: It wants to kill us.\nDOCTOR: No. No, I don't think that's the reason. Something is attracting it towards the boat. Below decks.\nFITZROY: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: We've got to get below decks! Come on!\nGRETA: Doctor, what is happening?\nDOCTOR: Right, I want a complete search of the whole ship. Anything that you brought on board since coming to the island.\nFITZROY: Anything that we've brought aboard?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Food supplies, samples of the local bird life, anything at all.\nFITZROY: But what are we looking for?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure, but I'll know it when we find it. If we find it in time.\nGRETA: What is that?\nDOCTOR: Sonic emission detector.\nFITZROY: What does it do?\nDOCTOR: It detects sonic emissions. Listen, a device has been placed on board the Beagle. A device that is sending out a homing signal to our scaly friend out there.\nFITZROY: You mean it's being summoned?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. And it will stop at nothing to reach the source of the signal. And anything that gets in its way will be matchwood.\nLOKAN: [OC]: The marine transport is under attack.\nSH'VAK: I don't understand, Tulok. You have deliberately allowed the ape creatures to return to their craft to be killed?\nTULOK: Yes. It pleased me to us them as the means to their own destruction.\nFITZROY: Doctor, we've gone through the whole ship and found nothing. Are you sure there's such a device on board?\nDOCTOR: Yes! This indicator shows there is a homing device somewhere nearby. Somewhere\nDOCTOR: Quick, everybody, down here. Down towards me. Fitzroy, Greta! Oh, I hoped I was wrong. The device summoning the creature, they've implanted it in Greta!\nGRETA: It would kill you and everyone to try to reach me? No! I will not let it!\nDOCTOR: No, Greta! Greta, come back!\nFITZROY: I'm sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (sighs) Yes. Yes, so am I.\nFITZROY: What was that thing?\nDOCTOR: That? That, my dear Captain Fitzroy, was an adult Myrka.\nLOKAN: [OC]: The Myrka is moving away from the ape creature's vessel.\nTULOK: I hope it enjoyed its meal.\nSH'VAK: You were using a sonic implant. Their use in Myrka hunts is forbidden. It is excessively cruel.\nTULOK: Sh'vak, the numbers of these ape creatures must be contained by any means necessary. You have prepared the bacterial culture?\nSH'VAK: Yes. It is carried by an air-borne micro-organism. Unchecked, it will swiftly lead to a pandemic amongst the ape creatures. The plague will wipe out all but the newborn.\nTULOK: And it kills quickly?\nSH'VAK: Death is inevitable in a matter of minutes.\nTULOK: Excellent.\nLOKAN: [OC]: Leader, the two ape creatures have been captured and placed in the enclosure.\nTULOK: Good. We shall test the bacteria at once.\nEVELYN: Charles. Charles. Are you all right?\nDARWIN: I feel so thirsty. My head aches, but otherwise I am well.\nEVELYN: Oh, that's good to hear.\nDARWIN: These creatures, they must be some form of lizard with a developed intelligence. I do not think I have ever seen anything more hideous, and yet the features resemble those of a human face.\nEVELYN: What do you mean?\nDARWIN: Don't you see? The patterns of life have repeated themselves. They are almost like a man. Descent through modification. This proves it.\nEVELYN: You mean these are lizards that have evolved?\nDARWIN: Evolved? No, no. These lizards have been modified into the form most suited to God's Earth, the form of Man, but\nEVELYN: But?\nDARWIN: I scarcely dare think it, let alone speak the words. Who is to say that mankind is not the result of the same process? That we are nothing more than, than modified\nEVELYN: Go on.\nLOKAN: Ape creatures.\nFITZROY: Your fire has burnt itself out, Doctor. Fortunately, the damage is not too serious. Nothing we Can't repair, given a day or so.\nDOCTOR: You don't have that long. You've seen what these creatures are capable of. You must go while you have the chance.\nFITZROY: Doctor, you're forgetting Mister Darwin and Miss Smythe.\nDOCTOR: Mister Darwin and? Yes, where are they? Oh, don't tell me. They returned to the island to look for me, didn't they?\nFITZROY: This morning. They should have come back by now.\nDOCTOR: Right, I'm going to have to return to the island. Captain Fitzroy, if I'm not back by nightfall, you must leave without me.\nFITZROY: I will give the instruction for my men to leave failing our return.\nDOCTOR: Good. Wait a minute. Our return?\nFITZROY: Oh, I'm coming with you, Doctor. I Know better than to let you out of my sight a second time.\nDOCTOR: (sighs) Oh, very well, if you insist. You can row.\nEVELYN: What's this stuff they've given us? It looks like seaweed. (sniffs) Smells like seaweed.\nDARWIN: Just as those creatures are to us nothing more than lizards that have developed intelligence\nEVELYN: It is seaweed.\nDARWIN: To them we are little more than apes.\nEVELYN: Charles, are you sure this is the best time to discuss this?\nDARWIN: But don't you see? There is nothing to set Man apart from nature. We are as much its subjects as any other creature. There was no Eden. It is a myth. No, it is not even a myth. It is a lie.\nFITZROY: So what do you believe has become of Mister Darwin and Miss Smythe, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, if they were searching for me, the first thing they would have done is go and see the Governor of the island.\nFITZROY: Lawson! But you said he was in league with these creatures.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Lawson's been imprisoning innocent people and handing them over to the Silurians.\nFITZROY: Why? What do they want with them?\nDOCTOR: That's what I'm hoping he will tell me.\nLAWSON: Yes, what is it? I'm extremely busy.\nLAWSON: Captain Fitzroy! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: You weren't expecting to see me so soon.\nLAWSON: Not at all. I mean, I'm delighted to find you alive.\nDOCTOR: Surprised too, I dare say.\nFITZROY: Sit down, Lawson.\nLAWSON: Captain Fitzroy, I beg your pardon.\nDOCTOR: We know what you've been up to.\nLAWSON: I will hear none of this. Guard! Guard!\nFITZROY: I'm afraid you'll find that your men are otherwise occupied.\nLAWSON: What?\nDOCTOR: Oh, there was a small fire at the harbour. Well, it was small to start with.\nLAWSON: How dare you!\nDOCTOR: Quiet! Lawson, I want you to answer me. Why have you been sending innocent to jail?\nLAWSON: They are not innocent. They are traitors to the Federal Government. They deserve\nDOCTOR: To die? Is that what you think has happened to them? Is that what was supposed to have happened to me?\nLAWSON: I, I don't know. They said\nDOCTOR: Oh, let me tell you, Lawson. I am a very, very difficult man to kill. I'm not going to waste time. We know that you're acting on behalf of the Silurians.\nLAWSON: You will regret interfering, Doctor. They are powerful and merciless.\nDOCTOR: And you are their slave, Lawson. They take weaknesses such as vanity and greed and petty cruelty, and they twist them to control your mind. And since you display those qualities in such abundance, I'm sure they didn't find it too difficult.\nLAWSON: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: You've seen a pocket watch before, haven't you? Just follow it with your eyes. See how the light flickers as it spins. Concentrate.\nLAWSON: Ha! I think you'll find I'm not suscept. not suscept. Ah.\nFITZROY: What are you doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just a little mesmeric influence. Governor Lawson, can you hear me?\nLAWSON: Doctor, I hear you.\nDOCTOR: You were visited earlier today by two friends of mine, Evelyn and Charles.\nLAWSON: I remember. They had come looking for you. I said I had not seen you.\nDOCTOR: Where did they go next?\nLAWSON: They went to the jail house, and then they were delivered to my masters.\nFITZROY: You sent them to be executed? Damn you, man.\nLAWSON: No, no, not executed. My masters are collecting specimens.\nDOCTOR: Specimens?\nLAWSON: [OC]: Of humans. They allow me to pick and choose subjects who will not be missed. I send them off to the jail house and they never come back. (laughs)\nFITZROY: [OC]: I do not believe it. That is absolutely monstrous.\nSH'VAK: The ape creature Lawson has betrayed us. I said he was too weak-minded.\nTULOK: Lokan, have you tested the bacteria on the ape creatures yet?\nLOKAN: [OC]: Not yet, Leader. We were about\nTULOK: Good. I have a better subject in mind.\nDOCTOR: How do you communicate with them, your masters?\nLAWSON: They speak to me through the air. It is a marvel.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Now here's your marvel. A simple two-way video link.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. Butterfingers. And presumably you control the jail house from here? A fully- automated system complete with hidden surveillance cameras. And this operates the jail doors, I take it.\nLAWSON: The jail doors, yes.\nDOCTOR: A concealed passageway which leads directly to the Silurians' bunker. Right. I'll just jam the settings and er ah! Ah ha!\nDOCTOR: That should stop you unjamming them.\nFITZROY: We are leaving, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. There's one more thing I must do. Lawson.\nLAWSON: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Silurians have a grip on your mind, but you can break free from that grip. I can help you to do it.\nLAWSON: To be free, to be the person I was before?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLAWSON: Or to serve my masters. (laughs)\nDOCTOR: I'm giving you the choice. But remember, if you want to be free, that means you must live with the consequences of your actions. You can't run or hide. You will have to make peace with your conscience.\nLAWSON: No, I can't do that.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nLAWSON: I am, Doctor.\nFITZROY: You're saying you'd prefer to be controlled by these monsters than have a will of your own?\nDOCTOR: It's time we were gone. Captain Fitzroy, after you.\nFITZROY: But surely\nDOCTOR: No, he's made his choice. Come on.\nLAWSON: Masters? I have served you well, haven't I? Please, I beg you, tell me that I've served you well. Masters! Masters, where are you? Why can't I hear you talk to me any more?\nEVELYN: It's no good, there's no way out. Not a ventilation shaft in sight.\nDARWIN: Some years ago, before I joined the expedition, I was training to be a surgeon, and a very poor surgeon I made. You know why?\nEVELYN: No, but I'm desperate for you to tell me.\nDARWIN: My faith. Because I thought a man has been created in God's image, and I couldn't bear the thought of us being anything less. But during surgery, we opened up the bodies. It was the same bloody collection of mortal organs that you'd see in an abattoir. Inside, we're no different from the animals, and that's what scared me.\nEVELYN: It scared you?\nDARWIN: Because I think, even then, I realised we are just animals. It is only through our arrogance we put ourselves above them. Such supreme vanity that we think ourselves the image of some God!\nEVELYN: Sit down, Charles. You're not going to help us by shouting.\nDARWIN: But I believed, Evelyn. I truly believed.\nFITZROY: Where are we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This tunnel leads down to the Silurians' bunker.\nFITZROY: This is the route that those poor unfortunate souls took?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFITZROY: But why? What do these Silurian fellows want with us?\nDOCTOR: Specimens, Lawson said. But I don't think I'd necessarily believe him if he said that all the world's oceans were a bit on the wet side. Hello.\nFITZROY: Oh, my word. What is this place?\nDOCTOR: Captain, this is the Silurians' hibernation chamber.\nFITZROY: Their what chamber?\nDOCTOR: Many hundreds of thousands of years ago, the Silurians put themselves into a deep sleep in chambers like these. Impressive, isn't it?\nFITZROY: You're saying that they put themselves into these coffin things?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Terrible disaster had befallen the Earth, you see, and their intention was to wake up after it was all over.\nFITZROY: It's like a tomb.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. Yes, it is a tomb of sorts. Look.\nFITZROY: Oh, what is that?\nDOCTOR: That's a Silurian. Or rather, it was once. They never did wake up, you see. And of course eventually the cryogenic seals rotted away, and, well, as the chamber flooded with sea water, they're dead. They're all dead.\nFITZROY: And that sludge is all that's left?\nDOCTOR: Considering their age, they're remarkably well-preserved. We're talking about something that happened hundreds of thousands of years ago. Ah ha.\nFITZROY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The control unit for the hibernation chamber. If you'll just give me a hand, it's quite corroded.\nDOCTOR: Heavy to open. Ah! (relief) Now, let's see. That's the timing mechanism that was supposed to bring the Silurians out of hibernation. There must have been some malfunction, I suppose. Hello. Now this is very, very interesting.\nFITZROY: What?\nDOCTOR: It was no accident.\nFITZROY: Doctor! There's someone coming.\nDOCTOR: I think we'd better get out of here. Follow me.\nDARWIN: It all fits the theory. Everything in nature is the result of the same fixed laws.\nEVELYN: What about these lizard creatures? Where do they fit in the grand scheme of things?\nDARWIN: Have you noticed the third eye they have in the crest of their foreheads? They must possess some measure of power beyond our comprehension, because they managed to overcome both of us without using any physical force.\nEVELYN: Telepathy?\nDARWIN: So they are the more developed species.\nEVELYN: So what do you think they're going to do with us?\nDARWIN: What does any species do to its inferiors?\nFITZROY: (breathless) One moment, Doctor, please. I can barely see where I am going.\nDOCTOR: All right, Captain. I think we're safe now.\nFITZROY: Those, those things back there were Silurians, I take it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Luckily I don't think they saw us. Did you see they were taking the passage leading up to the jail house?\nFITZROY: But that means they were going to the settlement.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I wonder what they want there? Hmm.\nFITZROY: Oh, it's freezing.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Yes, it is a bit chilly. Stay close to me. Oh, it's getting lighter up ahead.\nFITZROY: These walls, they're solid ice and, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. So that's what's happened to all the missing prisoners. Of course.\nFITZROY: What is this place?\nDOCTOR: I should have thought that was obvious. Corpses hanging by hooks from the ceiling like so many bloated bags of grey and white mottled flesh? Doesn't it remind you of anything?\nFITZROY: Of course it does. They're like carcasses in a, in a butcher's shop.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. This is the Silurians' larder.\nFITZROY: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: They eat people.\nFITZROY: But that is monstrous, absolutely monstrous!\nDOCTOR: Is it? All species prey on lesser species. That's how nature works. Just because Man doesn't happen to be the top of this particular food chain, well, that doesn't make it wrong.\nFITZROY: How could you say such a thing? They're human beings, hung up there like\nDOCTOR: Like cattle? To the Silurians, that's all humans are.\nFITZROY: We are not. We have morality, culture. We have immortal souls. We're not just dumb animals to be butchered.\nDOCTOR: As far as the Silurians are concerned, that is exactly what you are. Dumb animals, that have, unfortunately, multiplied out of control and overrun the planet.\nFITZROY: But if that is true, that is inhuman.\nSH'VAK: But we are not human.\nFITZROY: Get back. Get back. What are you?\nSH'VAK: The Doctor was right. We are the superior race. We are Silurians.\nFITZROY: No!\nDOCTOR: Fitzroy, no! It's no use.\nFITZROY: No, no, no. I can't.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak, I must talk to you. It's terribly important.\nSH'VAK: Silence. You will come with us.\nLAWSON: Master, I could not hear you or speak to you. I believe the Doctor destroyed your marvels. Master, it's me, your servant, Lawson. Your loyal and obedient servant.\nTULOK: Obedient servant?\nLAWSON: Yes, master. I've served you well, haven't I?\nTULOK: We shall see. In this container is a microscopic bacteria. Once released, it will strip your flesh from your bones. It will then spread rapidly through the air to feed on every adult ape creature in the settlement. Within an hour, you will all be dead. I want you to open the container, Lawson.\nLAWSON: No. I won't. I\nTULOK: You will obey. Open it.\nLAWSON: But there's nothing in there. You were testing me, weren't you, master?\nTULOK: The punishment for failure is death.\nLAWSON: I don't understand, mast (gasps) No, what's happening to me? It burns! My hands!\nTULOK: You should be grateful. Even as your body is eaten away, you assist the Silurian race. Thanks to you, the Earth will soon be ours.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak, you must listen to me. You were asking about the other Silurian colonies, whether any had survived? I know what happened.\nSH'VAK: Both of you, in there.\nDOCTOR: Wait. Ow!\nEVELYN: Doctor. Oh, at last. I knew you'd turn up eventually.\nFITZROY: Charles! And Miss Smythe. You're well?\nDARWIN: Much the better for seeing you, Captain. And the Doctor. I have so many questions for you.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure you do, but they will have to wait. Evelyn, Charles, have the Silurians harmed either of you at all?\nEVELYN: No, I wouldn't say they. What did you call them? Silurians?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nEVELYN: I wouldn't say they've been the perfect hosts but, apart from keeping us cooped up in here, they haven't done anything.\nDOCTOR: That's something, at least.\nDARWIN: What is it, Doctor? Fitzroy?\nFITZROY: You tell them, Doctor. I cannot stomach it.\nDOCTOR: The Governor of this island, Lawson, he's been imprisoning innocent people and supplying them to the Silurians.\nEVELYN: We'd guessed as much. Wait, what do you mean, supplying them?\nDOCTOR: Lawson has been providing the Silurians with their source of food.\nDARWIN: My God.\nDOCTOR: Fitzroy and I visited their deep-freeze. It was er, well-stocked.\nEVELYN: You mean? That's horrible.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it's going to get a good deal more horrible than that.\nDARWIN: What are you saying, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Let me explain. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the Silurians ruled the Earth. Also at this time, Man was at a very early stage in his development and was little better\nDARWIN: Than a primitive ape.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Presumably at that time, the Silurians were farming those primitive ape creatures for food, in much the same way that you would farm chickens or goats. Anyway,\nDOCTOR: [OC]: The Silurians had to go into hibernation, and whilst they were asleep\nDARWIN: The ape creatures that were left behind began to change gradually and through process of descent through modification.\nSH'VAK: These creatures believe they are the result of natural selection? They do not realise their true nature.\nLOKAN: Sh'vak, should I have them slaughtered?\nSH'VAK: No, Lokan. No, not yet. There is still more to be learned from the one called the Doctor. He knows about the Great Hibernation.\nTANNOY: Gortal Clan report to hibernation chamber four. Gortal Clan, report.\nTANNOY: 2: Temperature is reduced to twenty below freezing. I repeat, the temperature has dropped to.\nSILURIAN: S'Rel Tulok, the penalty for your crimes is death. However, in recognition of your past achievements we are prepared to show you mercy. You will be banished to the Earth's surface.\nSH'VAK: There is nothing I can do. I'm sorry.\nTULOK: Don't let them do this. Those cowards, they dare to condemn me. And my creatures. What will happen to my creatures?\nTULOK: No, no, Sh'vak. Sh'vak, don't leave me out here. Sh'vak, don't leave me out here.\nSH'VAK: Tulok.\nTULOK: Sh'vak, I knew you could not betray me.\nSH'VAK: You saved my life once. I will never forget that. We haven't got much time. We must get to the hibernation chambers.\nTULOK: The hibernation chambers? Not yet. I must know what's happened to my creatures.\nSH'VAK: The genetic augmentations? Why do you care what happens to them?\nSILURIAN: Release the monstrosities onto the planet's surface to join their creator. The vengeance of nature shall sweep them both away.\nTULOK: The cages, they are empty. They're all empty! Argh,\nSH'VAK: We are too late. They must have sent them out onto the surface.\nTULOK: Oh, my creatures. (can't make it out) for the primitive beasts into sentient beings, something that is almost our equal. That is why they called them monsters. That is why they are frightened of what I have achieved. I improved their flavour, I made them breed faster, I made them resistant to disease. Our leaders were satisfied enough then. But then I made them intelligent enough to cultivate themselves. I gave them their own minds.\nSH'VAK: Tulok, we must go.\nTULOK: But now all my work has been destroyed. I will not forgive this.\nSH'VAK: There's nothing you can do. The Triad leaders have all entered suspended animation. It's time we joined them.\nTULOK: I shall have my revenge.\nTULOK: Sh'vak.\nSH'VAK: Tulok.\nSH'VAK: How did the bacteria perform in the test?\nTULOK: It was most satisfactory. The plague spread rapidly throughout the settlement. All but the new-born have now been destroyed. Sh'vak, start mass-producing the bacteria.\nSH'VAK: Yes, Leader.\nTULOK: We shall depart for the mainland as soon as possible. Once there, we will release the\nTULOK: infection into the atmosphere. We will sweep the adult humans from the face of the Earth in a tide of blood.\nSH'VAK: And the infants that remain?\nTULOK: As we repopulate the planet, they will become our slaves, except of course for those we bring to the slaughter.\nLOKAN: [OC]: Leader Tulok, the ape creatures. We have two more captives.\nTULOK: Excellent. I have developed an appetite.\nDARWIN: That's where we came from. That is the origin of our species. We are just these lizard men's cattle.\nFITZROY: Charles, but what you're saying, it's beyond blasphemy.\nDARWIN: What, that Man is a result not of divine providence but the struggle for survival? Oh, we assume that the abundance of nature is proof of the Lord's existence, but what if that is not so? What if our existence is just the result of blind chance?\nFITZROY: What do you mean?\nDARWIN: A God that did not create the world, the oceans, and animals, and the plants. A God that did not make Man. A God responsible for nothing may as well be no God at all. Do you not agree, Doctor?\nEVELYN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don't know. But I'll tell you one thing. In the skies above us are a billion suns, each circled by their own worlds. And on those worlds, wherever there is the opportunity for life, you will find it. That is the miracle. Life endures. It thrives. It defeats every adversity. It creates order out of chaos. Above us is a universe full of wonder, and we are just\nTULOK: You humans, you did not evolve from apes by accident. You are the product of my genetic engineering. I created you. I am your God."

      "searchable_dialogue": "DARWIN: What in the name of all that's\nTULOK: You are my creatures. I raised you up from amongst the animals. You belong to me.\nFITZROY: Never!\nTULOK: You, the humans from the marine transport, come with me.\nDARWIN: No. We are not your creatures.\nTULOK: You cannot resist. Your minds are but clay in my hands. You will obey me.\nTULOK: You are now under my direction. Follow.\nDARWIN: + FITZROY: Yes, master.\nEVELYN: Doctor, where's it taking them?\nDOCTOR: I'm not sure.\nEVELYN: What did that creature mean when it said we are the product of its genetic engineering?\nDOCTOR: It's perfectly straight forward. To them, humans are just cattle that they have altered to be more economic, more productive.\nEVELYN: Like making wheat resistant to frost and insects?\nDOCTOR: Exactly, except in this case they not only improve their cattle physically but mentally. They took Australopithecus apes and made Homo Sapiens. You, Evelyn.\nEVELYN: So that's why there isn't a missing link. There never was one.\nDOCTOR: Mmm hmm.\nEVELYN: We were just concocted in a test tube somewhere.\nDOCTOR: The Silurians have upset the delicate balance of nature. Just as a modified crop can overrun the countryside, decimating all rival species, the same thing happened with humanity. That's the trouble with genetically modified foods. You turn your back for five minutes, and they've taken over the world.\nEVELYN: So what is it the Silurians intend to do?\nDOCTOR: Suppose you woke up to discover that your house was overrun by vermin. What would you do?\nEVELYN: I'd put down some pesticide.\nDOCTOR: Ah ha.\nEVELYN: Oh. I see.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nEVELYN: So what are we going to do? Sitting her talking isn't\nEVELYN: [OC]: Going to get us out of here.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: You would be surprised.\nTULOK: Sh'vak, you have synthesised the bacteria as instructed?\nSH'VAL: Yes, Leader. These canisters contain sufficient quantity of the micro-organism to eradicate a whole continent of the ape creatures.\nTULOK: They must be loaded into the submersible at once. Ape creatures.\nDARWIN: + FITZROY: Yes?\nTULOK: You will take these canisters to the submersible bay. Lift them, one each. I will guide you.\nDARWIN: + FITZROY: Yes, master.\nEVELYN: [OC]: The hibernation chamber? You mean that big sort of crypt with all the stone coffins?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Yes. The device that was supposed to reanimate the Silurians from their dormant state, the timing mechanism had been disconnected.\nEVELYN: [OC]: What do you mean, disconnected?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: It had been fixed so that when the activation signal came through, the Silurians wouldn't wake up, throughout the globe.\nEVELYN: [OC]: But who'd do such a thing?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Well, if I could show you the control unit, you'd be able to see the sabotage for yourself. You'd be able to see that someone had rigged the resuscitation linkages so that only a few dozen Silurians and their pet Myrka would survive, so that they alone would remain as the rest of their race were condemned to their graves.\nSH'VAK: Tulok.\nTULOK: Ape creatures, load the canisters into the submersible here.\nFITZROY: Yes, master.\nLOKAN: The submersible is primed and ready to be launched.\nTULOK: That is good. Ape creatures, return to the laboratory and fetch the remaining canisters.\nEVELYN: Well, it's all very fascinating, you telling me all this, but I still can't see how it's going to help up get out of here.\nDOCTOR: Have a little faith. (sotto) Our conversation is being monitored.\nEVELYN: (sotto) You mean the cell is bugged? Where?\nDOCTOR: (sotto) That's not important.\nEVELYN: (sotto) But how can you be so sure\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nSH'VAK: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak.\nEVELYN: All right.\nDOCTOR: You were listening, then, I take it?\nSH'VAK: Doctor, I have visited the hibernation centre and examined the control unit. You were correct.\nDOCTOR: I'm very sorry.\nSH'VAK: Tulok. So that was his revenge. To deny the Silurians their day of awakening. To deny them the world. All part of his retribution.\nDOCTOR: You know why he did it?\nSH'VAK: Our leaders wanted to put an end to his experiments. He had broken the most sacred tenets of Silurian law by tampering with creation. Our leaders sentenced him to be banished to the surface of the planet with his creatures, but\nDOCTOR: But?\nSH'VAK: But I saved him.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see.\nSH'VAK: Because of me, Tulok has destroyed an entire race. He has committed the ultimate evil. He has betrayed the natural order.\nEVELYN: The natural order?\nDOCTOR: The belief that is the foundation of Silurian culture, that life exists only as nature's servant.\nSH'VAK: Tulok thought himself its master. But his arrogance is not his own. It is that of the whole Silurian race. Through him, we destroyed our world. We destroyed ourselves. We have no claim to the Earth.\nDOCTOR: You mean you're prepared to let humanity have the planet?\nSH'VAK: They deserve the chance to survive. We had our time and failed. Let humanity further (uncertain) it.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak, it's not too late. You can make amends, you know.\nSH'VAK: I thought I would show him compassion, and how did he repay me?\nDOCTOR: You only did what you thought was right. Compassion is nothing to regret.\nSH'VAK: There is only one way I can redeem the memory of the Silurian race. Tulok must be stopped.\nEVELYN: What does he intend to do?\nSH'VAK: We have developed an airborne bacteria that will wipe out all humans.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSH'VAK: Our submersible is about to leave for the mainland, and then Tulok is going to release the bacteria into the atmosphere.\nTULOK: All of the canisters have been loaded?\nLOKAN: Yes, Leader.\nTULOK: Excellent. Have the two ape creatures taken back to the enclosure, Lokan.\nLOKAN: Yes, Leader.\nTULOK: Wait. Sh'vak. Where is Primary Scientist Sh'vak?\nLOKAN: I do not know.\nTULOK: She should be here, unless. Delay the launch. I must return to the bunker.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak, get us out of here. If what you say is true, we don't have much time left.\nSH'VAK: Tulok has betrayed me. He will die.\nDOCTOR: No, I can help you.\nSH'VAK: I must go.\nDOCTOR: No, wait, wait.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nEVELYN: Right. So much for Sh'vak helping us. What do we do now?\nDOCTOR: I'd rather been banking being on the other side of that door. Oh, I hope Sh'vak, well, I hope she doesn't try anything rash. She's our only chance of getting out of here in one piece.\nEVELYN: What about Charles and Captain Fitzroy? You don't think they\nLOKAN: You, ape creatures, in.\nDARWIN: + FITZROY: Yes, master.\nEVELYN: Thank goodness they're all right.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn't be so certain.\nEVELYN: What?\nDOCTOR: Well, they're in a state of catalepsy. A form of post-psychic shock. The Silurians have been controlling them. They have a telepathic link into the primal mind. They can operate humans like, well, marionettes.\nEVELYN: Like Lawson, you mean? You're saying they're under some sort of hypnosis.\nDOCTOR: Fortunately, in the hands of an expert it's reversible. Charles? Fitzroy? Concentrate on my voice. On the count of three, you will wake up, free from the Silurians' influence. One, two, three. Wake up. (snaps fingers)\nDARWIN: Oh, what's happened?\nFITZROY: The lizard creature, it claimed to be God.\nEVELYN: You don't remember anything else?\nDARWIN: It is a blur. The Silurian was declaring that it created Man. Is this true, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, Charles, the Silurians used their great scientific knowledge to domestic and adapt a form of primitive ape. Your ancestors are the products of Tulok's experimentation.\nDARWIN: And to think I thought Man was the product of the descent with modification. How could I be so mistaken, so wilfully blind to imagine\nDOCTOR: No, no, you weren't wrong, Charles. Your theory still stands.\nEVELYN: (sotto) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nEVELYN: (sotto) What was it you told me about prompting?\nDOCTOR: Oh, er. (sotto) It's too important.\nDARWIN: Doctor, if what you claim is true, if these Silurian creatures had domination over the Earth, why did they not leave fossils? We have petrified relics of land mammals, but we have nothing akin to these creatures at all.\nDOCTOR: Monkton's Theorum. Any reasonably intelligent lifeform is not going to leave a fossil. Only the most stupid creatures will be preserved because they are the only ones who are going to allow themselves to get trapped in tar pits.\nDARWIN: But why aren't there any other remains? You said these creatures once had vast cities.\nDOCTOR: That was over a million years ago. Tell me, how many of your buildings would last that long? Your oldest structures are barely ten millennia old, never mind a hundred times that. Ask yourself, what will be humanity's legacy, hmm? There won't be any great monuments or fossils or graves, or even one footprint. Not a single trace will remain. It will be as if mankind had never existed.\nEVELYN: Oh, don't say that. That's horrible.\nDOCTOR: You should see it as I see it. That's history. All of human life, just a brief candle in the darkness.\nTULOK: Ah, Sh'vak. At last.\nSH'VAK: Tulok, I want to talk to you.\nSH'VAK: About the hibernation chambers.\nTULOK: I am not interested.\nSH'VAK: The control unit, it was sabotaged.\nTULOK: Who told you this, the Doctor?\nSH'VAK: I saved your life once. You owe me the truth.\nTULOK: I have not forgotten, but I tell you it was an accident.\nSH'VAK: I've been to the hibernation chambers and examined the unit for myself. The timing mechanism had been deliberately disconnected.\nTULOK: They were weak. I had to do it. The cowards, they deserved to die. They dared to condemn me. They treated me like a criminal. They wanted me dead. But now the world is mine, and in this brave new Earth I will be as a god, the Creator Supreme. The world will be ours once more, Sh'vak.\nSH'VAK: You dishonour our memory. You have betrayed everything we hold sacred. Better the humans have the Earth, than an Earth ruled by you. You have destroyed our entire race. You have destroyed our world.\nTULOK: Sh'vak, what are you doing? No!\nSH'VAK: You are evil. You must die.\nTULOK: You think you can kill me so easily, Sh'vak? You are foolish. Your mental powers are no equal to mine.\nSH'VAK: I will stop you. I must.\nTULOK: I have your mind in my grasp.\nSH'VAK: No.\nTULOK: You always were pathetic, Sh'vak. So easily manipulated. But now you are not needed.\nTULOK: Die. Die. Die!\nFITZROY: These creatures had some sort of mental hold over us? I can scarcely believe it.\nDARWIN: They can render us unconscious without recourse to physical action, or coerce us into action. We are but animals of the lowest grade to them.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. To the Silurians, you are no different from those easily dominated savages they harvested all those years ago.\nFITZROY: But modern man is quite distinct from the savage. They are creatures of instinct and superstition. We are civilised.\nDOCTOR: Civilised? When you treat your fellow man as an inferior being?\nDARWIN: No, but Doctor, perhaps Captain Fitzroy has a point. If we are agreed upon the hypothesis of natural selection, might not Man have changed in some small measure since the Silurians ruled the Earth? Perhaps they do not realise it, but perhaps we are not quite the same species. Perhaps we are\nDARWIN: now endowed with a higher intelligence and self-will.\nEVELYN: You mean we might have developed a resistance to their mental control?\nDARWIN: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: I think you may be on to something, Charles.\nFITZROY: And how does this aid us?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they aren't quite as irresistible as they think they are. Maybe under certain circumstances Man can repel the will of the Silurians.\nFITZROY: You mean, we might be able to defeat them?\nDOCTOR: And if they don't realise that, or even better\nDOCTOR: [OC]: If that is precisely what they're afraid of\nTULOK: Afraid? If humanity has degraded, I will recreate a new species in its place. I hold that power.\nLOKAN: [OC]: Leader Tulok, the submersible\nTULOK: I will join you on board shortly, Lokan. Now I want the ape creatures slaughtered immediately.\nLOKAN: [OC]: Yes, Leader.\nTULOK: And so it begins, the purification of the Earth, the extermination that is good.\nEVELYN: But we still have to get out of this enclosure.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I'm open to any suggestions. No?\nEVELYN: Remember that thing where one of us pretends to be ill, and then when the guards rush in\nDOCTOR: No.\nEVELYN: No. You're supposed to be the one with all the clever ideas.\nDOCTOR: Well, I was hoping that Sh'vak would be able to help us, but\nDARWIN: Sh'vak is the one who consented to aid us?\nTULOK: [OC]: Ape creatures, your attention. I am about to depart in my submersible craft, where I intend to rid this planet of your degenerate bloodline. Doctor, I am aware of your conspiracy against me. It has failed.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTULOK: [OC]: Sh'vak is dead.\nDOCTOR: Oh, now we're in serious trouble.\nEVELYN: You mean we weren't in serious trouble before? And there was me worrying.\nTULOK: [OC]: I have sent a Silurian to put you all to death. Your bodies will be consumed on our return. Die well, Doctor. I feel I will particularly enjoy the taste of your corpse.\nDOCTOR: And just what are you implying by that, exactly, eh?\nEVELYN: Oh, come on, Doctor. We have to do something.\nDOCTOR: I'm afraid it's already too late. Listen. They're on their way.\nFITZROY: This is it. We must try to overpower them. It's our only chance. Charles, ready?\nDOCTOR: No, wait!\nSH'VAK: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak! But I thought. Tulok said you were dead.\nSH'VAK: Tulok overcame me, but perhaps I am not as weak-willed as he thought. He crushed my mind but I held on, alive.\nDARWIN: But what about the Silurian despatched to kill us?\nSH'VAK: He is no longer a threat.\nFITZROY: You mean, you mean you're with us, lizard?\nSH'VAK: Yes\nDOCTOR: Good. Well, I'm glad we got all that sorted out. Now, we haven't got much time, if it's not already too late. We have to stop Tulok leaving at all costs. I think, the control room.\nEVELYN: And what do you intend to do when we get there?\nDOCTOR: Oh, er, well, by then I'll probably have thought of something terribly ingenious. Come on!\nLOKAN: Leader Tulok.\nTULOK: Our craft is ready to leave?\nLOKAN: Yes, Leader. All systems checked and initiated. Power output at parameter eight.\nTULOK: Then we must go immediately. Set a course for the mainland.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Er, hello there.\nTULOK: What?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Silurian bunker calling submersible. Bunker calling submersible. Can you read me?\nDOCTOR: Over.\nTULOK: What is this?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Ah, there you are, Tulok, old chap. Hope you're keeping well. So glad I caught you before you had to rush off. Over.\nTULOK: Doctor, you, you are in the bunker control room.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: That's right. Can't say I care for the décor, but as control rooms go, I've seen worse.\nEVELYN: [OC]: Over.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Oops, sorry. Over.\nTULOK: How did you escape from the enclosure? I sent a Silurian\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Oh, him. You know, you Silurians aren't all that invincible. It's quite easy to resist your telepathic attacks if you put your mind to it. Human beings are stronger than they look. Over.\nTULOK: You lie! You are inferior. I made you inferior.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Well, we managed to escape and get into your control room, didn't we? Speaking of which, these hydrogen fusion reactors of yours, I find they overload so easily, don't they? All it takes is a few minor adjustments and you're minutes away from a major explosion.\nTULOK: What?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Oh, I want to meet you for a chat. Face to face. That's all. You know where to find me. You've got about fifteen minutes before this place goes up? Over and out.\nLOKAN: Leader, all systems are ready. Shall we leave?\nTULOK: No. Check the energy sensors.\nLOKAN: Energy sensors detect a power surge in bunker reactor. If it continues at the current rate\nTULOK: So the Doctor was telling the truth. Our departure can wait. He will die, even if it must be by my own hand. You will remain here on guard. We will see how well he resists the might of the Silurians.\nFITZROY: Right, so this Tulok fellow is on his way up. Now what, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, we'll have to try and hold him off somehow, won't we. You, me, and young Charles here.\nEVELYN: You really have overloaded the reactors?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, certainly. In fourteen minutes from now, we'll be blown sky-high.\nEVELYN: Well, in that case, shouldn't we be getting out of here?\nDOCTOR: No. No, we can't do that. We have to stay here. And whilst we're busy here, I want you to take this device and place it inside the submersible. Make sure it's well hidden.\nEVELYN: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, what?\nEVELYN: Me? Go down there? Alone? Please tell me you're joking.\nDOCTOR: I am deadly serious. Look, we'll be dealing with Tulok here, and keeping him out of your way, so you should be perfectly safe.\nEVELYN: I don't like the use of the word should.\nFITZROY: So it's just us three against Tulok? Do you sincerely believe we stand a chance of stopping him?\nDOCTOR: Well, always assuming that Charles was right.\nDARWIN: I was right?\nDOCTOR: That man has adapted over the last hundred thousand years, that you are no longer as susceptible to the Silurian psychic control as you once were.\nFITZROY: But Lawson.\nDOCTOR: Oh, people who want to be lead always will be. Perhaps he had a domineering mother. Anyway, we three with enough will-power should be able to, well, at least keep him busy for a while. For thirteen minutes or so.\nFITZROY: Just how do we do this?\nDOCTOR: You should concentrate your minds. Keep all your thoughts fixed on something you believe in.\nSH'VAK: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Sh'vak. Now, you know what you have to do.\nSH'VAK: I understand. (receding) I must remain out of sight.\nFITZROY: Doctor, it's Tulok. He's coming.\nDOCTOR: Right, everyone ready. Evelyn, you must go, now.\nEVELYN: All right. Good luck.\nDOCTOR: Good luck.\nDOCTOR: Fitzroy, Charles, remember what I said. Concentrate on something you believe in totally.\nTULOK: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Tulok. Delighted you could make it.\nDOCTOR: You've already met my friends, Charles Darwin, Captain Fitzroy, haven't you?\nTULOK: You have overloaded the hydrogen reactor. Move away from the controls now.\nDOCTOR: No, I don't think so. And before you attack us, I wouldn't advise using your third eye in here. A couple of inches out and the energy will destroy the reactor override, which I don't need to tell you will immediately precipitate a fission meltdown, or in other words, a very, very big explosion.\nTULOK: You, stop the power transfer.\nDOCTOR: And if you take one step closer, I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to press this button here, which will also immediately precipitate a fission meltdown.\nTULOK: Stop the power transfer. I command you to stop it.\nDOCTOR: No. No. You see, your telepathy won't work on us. We can beat you.\nTULOK: No. You ape creatures, I order you, kill the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Charles, Fitzroy, now! Concentrate now! You can resist.\nDARWIN: No, no.\nDOCTOR: Hold on, Charles. Keep a grip on your mind. Remember what I said, Charles.\nDARWIN: I can't.\nTULOK: Your minds, your minds are mine.\nDOCTOR: No! You're wrong!\nTULOK: You cannot resist me.\nDOCTOR: We can resist you.\nDARWIN: I can't fight it much longer, Doctor. He's too strong.\nDOCTOR: You must hold on, Charles.\nDARWIN: It's inside my head. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.\nDOCTOR: Don't let him control you. Concentrate now!\nDARWIN: Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.\nDOCTOR: Something you believe in. Come on, Charles.\nTULOK: I command you, kill the Doctor.\nDARWIN: Forgive us our trespasses.\nDOCTOR: No. Come on, Fitzroy. Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!\nTULOK: Kill the Doctor. Kill him! Kill!\nEVELYN: So this is what the inside of a Silurian submarine looks like. Very nice, I must say. Now, where would be a good place to hide this. Ah, perfect.\nEVELYN: That was easy. I'm surprised these Silurians didn't think to leave someone on guard. Still, they'll never think of looking in there.\nLOKAN: Ape creature, what are you doing in here?\nTULOK: Kill the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hold on. Think what you believe in. What you truly believe in.\nTULOK: You must kill the Doctor.\nDARWIN: Our Saviour. No.\nDOCTOR: Go on, Charles.\nDARWIN: No, I don't. I believe\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nFITZROY: Master.\nDARWIN: I believe in descent through modification!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Charles!\nDARWIN: I believe in natural selection.\nDOCTOR: Yes!\nTULOK: It is no good, Doctor. You cannot fight me.\nDOCTOR: No. No, you're wrong. Man is not the primitive creature you once knew. Evolution has run its course. Humanity is no longer your servant.\nTULOK: You lie. I am your master.\nDARWIN: I believe! I believe Man has changed. Man is the master of his own destiny! You do not control us.\nTULOK: No! You bow down before me. I am your god.\nDARWIN: You are not our god. There is no god! We are the result of natural selection. We don't owe our existences to you!\nTULOK: You, Fitzroy, stop him.\nFITZROY: No, no. No, I don't obey.\nTULOK: What is happening?\nDOCTOR: You are weakening, Tulok. You can't break through. We're too strong for you.\nDARWIN: Whatever you may have done to us, Tulok, we have changed. We are our own creatures.\nTULOK: No. I must, I will control you.\nLOKAN: I will ask you again. What are you doing in here?\nEVELYN: (flat) Leader Tulok sent me to inform you that he has defeated the primitive ape creatures, and that he will return shortly to proceed with the big plan.\nLOKAN: You will return to Tulok and tell him that I await his further instructions.\nEVELYN: I obey, master.\nEVELYN: That's what I believe they call a close thing.\nDOCTOR: You're beaten, Tulok. A relic of a bygone age. You're obsolete.\nTULOK: No, I will rule.\nDARWIN: You created us, but now we are free.\nTULOK: So, if I can't command you, you will be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that's your answer to everything, isn't it, to destroy. You destroyed your own race. You killed Sh'vak.\nTULOK: The weak must die, Doctor. The superior species has always driven its rivals to extinction. That is the true natural order.\nDOCTOR: Talking of extinction, I think there's about two minutes left.\nTULOK: I will still have my revenge, Doctor. The world will still be mine.\nDARWIN: He's gone. We did it. We beat him.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, we did.\nFITZROY: Then you were right, Charles. We do have will-power to stand up to them.\nDARWIN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Well, to an extent, yes, but I'm afraid mankind hasn't changed all that much. You're still as vulnerable to the Silurians' telepathy as you ever were. You, er, had a little assistance.\nFITZROY: We were helped? What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak. She was creating a telepathic barrier through you and Charles.\nSH'VAK: (weak) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Sh'vak? Oh, no.\nSH'VAK: I have restored the natural order. The Earth is yours now.\nDARWIN: Sh'vak? But what happened to her?\nDOCTOR: The psychic strain must have been too much.\nSH'VAK: You said other Silurian clans had survived. Tell them, tell them what happened. Goodbye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I will, Sh'vak. I will.\nLOKAN: Leader Tulok, you defeated the ape creatures?\nTULOK: Set a course for the mainland. We must leave immediately.\nLOKAN: But Leader, the power surge is continuing. The base will be destroyed.\nTULOK: That is why we have to go now. Get us out of here.\nLOKAN: Yes, Leader. Drive initiated.\nDARWIN: Doctor, I don't wish to alarm you, but what I can grasp of these instruments, the submersible, it's getting away.\nEVELYN: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Evelyn, you're all right.\nDOCTOR: Did you manage\nEVELYN: Yes, I did. What's happened here? Sh'vak?\nDOCTOR: There isn't any time. We've got about sixty seconds to get out of here. But first.\nEVELYN: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Just activating the Silurian homing device. Good. Right, come on.\nDARWIN: Doctor, where are we going?\nDOCTOR: The lift, it's our only hope.\nLOKAN: We have now cleared the islands, Leader. Proceeding on a north-western course.\nTULOK: Excellent, Lokan. I am impatient. Prepare the warheads.\nLOKAN: Yes, Leader.\nTULOK: What was that?\nLOKAN: Sensors indicate (fear) it's the Myrka, Leader! It seems, it seems to be chasing us.\nTULOK: The Myrka? But how? The Doctor.\nLOKAN: Myrka now at a range of fifty metres. Forty metres and closing.\nTULOK: There must be a sonic emitter on board. Find it. We must find it immediately.\nLOKAN: Twenty metres. Instruments indicate a massive electrical charge. It's going to attack!\nTULOK: Argh!\nDOCTOR: Come on! Come on! Down here. There's only a few seconds. Quick, in here!\nDARWIN: What, what is this contraption?\nDOCTOR: A lift. It will take us up to the surface. Just a matter of tripping the servo release. There. Everyone inside! Charles, Evelyn, Fitzroy.\nEVELYN: Why aren't we moving? Have you tried pressing the button?\nDOCTOR: Have I tried pressing the button? Of course I've tried pressing the button.\nEVELYN: Well, try pressing it again. Maybe you didn't press it properly.\nFITZROY: Allow me.\nDOCTOR: It worked! Going up.\nDARWIN: Doctor, it's getting hotter.\nEVELYN: It's so peaceful. The birds, the sunset. You'd think that nothing had happened.\nDOCTOR: (chuckles) It is beautiful, isn't it? A sight to fill and elevate the mind.\nFITZROY: Doctor, over there. That column of smoke.\nDOCTOR: Ah, all that remains of Lawson's jail house, destroyed with the Silurians' bunker.\nDARWIN: And the Silurians themselves, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Gone.\nDARWIN: We'll never see or hear of them again.\nDOCTOR: Well, never is an awfully long time. There are certainly others in hibernation throughout the globe. There's always the possibility that their slumber may be disturbed, but not, I think, for another century or so.\nEVELYN: What about the settlement, Baquerizo Moreno?\nDOCTOR: Well, it should be safe now. The bacteria was designed to burn itself out once it had done its vile work. I think perhaps it would be a better memorial to those who died if it were left in peace.\nDARWIN: Indeed.\nFITZROY: Speaking of leaving, the night is drawing close. Perhaps we should reconvene to the Beagle, gentlemen, Miss Smythe?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Er, oh, er, no. no. No, it's time Miss Smythe and I returned to our own ship.\nDARWIN: Your own ship? You mean the one moored on the north side of the island?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. Before we go, Charles, Captain Fitzroy, I must ask you both something.\nFITZROY: What is your request, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It is vitally important that no one ever learns about the Silurians. When you make your accounts and journals of your voyages, please, make no mention of them.\nFITZROY: I don't think that we would. It would invite unqualified ridicule.\nDARWIN: I doubt that a solitary soul would believe us.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and one or two more things. In your accounts, I'd prefer it if you didn't mention Miss Smythe and myself.\nFITZROY: I cannot understand why, but as you wish, Doctor. And the second?\nDOCTOR: Charles, keep an eye out for a chap called Alfred Wallace.\nDARWIN: Alfred Wallace?\nDOCTOR: Remember the name. Well, goodbye. Charles, Fitzroy.\nFITZROY: Yes, yes. Well, good day to you both.\nDARWIN: Goodbye, Doctor. I won't forget this. (receding) It occurs to me, Captain\nEVELYN: Well, what now? The Tardis?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes. Hmm. Alfred Wallace. You know, that reminds me. I always meant to pop back and give him some moral support.\nEVELYN: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No?\nEVELYN: No.\nDOCTOR: Mmm, perhaps you're right, Evelyn. Perhaps you're right."
