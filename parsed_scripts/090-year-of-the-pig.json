      "searchable_dialogue": "TOBY: Who's dead today, Nurse Albertine?\nALBERTINE: The Junior Dean of St Cedds, quietly at home, Cardinal Tashan, internal haemorrhage at the altar rail, apparently.\nTOBY: Well, it’s what he would have wanted.\nALBERTINE: Mrs Lillian Washburn, in a ferocious fire at the Cecil Hotel. That'll be another day in court for the British Asbestic Plaster Company.\nTOBY: Lillian Washburn? I know that name.\nALBERTINE: American stage actress. We saw her in East Lynne at the Wood’s Theatre. You know, that place in Cincinnati with the dressing rooms that smelt of wet dog. You remember her. (Southern accent) Gone, gone, and never called me mother.\nTOBY: (laughs) Oh yes. Let’s send flowers to her agent, shall we? Anyone else?\nALBERTINE: Couple of Generals. Nobody we know.\nTOBY: Good. And what’s going on in the world?\nALBERTINE: Plucky little Belgium. Eddie Gray getting of a ship at Portsmouth. Gunboat diplomacy.\nTOBY: Is there any other sort?\nALBERTINE: Not these days.\nTOBY: What else?\nALBERTINE: Price of steel. The usual. Oh, it’s snowing in Davos.\nTOBY: That newspaper doesn't look very well ironed.\nALBERTINE: I'll have a word with the Boots.\nTOBY: He’s a good lad.\nALBERTINE: Don’t I always tell him so?\nTOBY: You know, when I was a boy, there were no places like this. None. Just coaching inns and lodging houses, and unspeakable digs. The staff would insult you, the room would be squeaking with vermin. You’d wake up with your vertebrae rearranged by the mattress, if you got any sleep, that is. But here we just listen for the water rushing at the sand, and wait for the buzzer to buzz. Wait for treats to arrive.\nALBERTINE: Any second now.\nTOBY: Good. Terribly important to eat well, when you’re the last human being on Earth.\nTOBY: God bless the King of the Belgians. I know what you're going to say about all those people who got their heads stuck on poles in the Congo, but he certainly knew a thing or two about how to spend time at the seaside. God bless the Hotel Palace Thermae, and all who sail in her.\nALBERTINE: Let’s make sure they’ve remembered everything, eh? Before we sign the bill and end up paying for crevettes that aren’t there.\nTOBY: Absolutely.\nALBERTINE: Coffee, one jug. Vichy water, one bottle. Madeleines, six.\nTOBY: Did they warm the linen?\nALBERTINE: Feel it yourself. Croissants, six. Melba toast, six slices. Pot of Beluga. Apricot jam.\nTOBY: With the stones in?\nALBERTINE: Yes.\nTOBY: Capital.\nALBERTINE: Butter.\nTOBY: Unsalted?\nALBERTINE: Unsalted. And under here.\nTOBY: The piéce de résistance.\nALBERTINE: Truffles. Black as tarmacadam on a hot afternoon in Piccadilly. They do look delicious.\nTOBY: Would you like some? You could call down for more.\nALBERTINE: I’m not that hungry really. I think I'll have a look through the telescope. See who’s on the beach.\nTOBY: Well, if you don’t mind, I'll tuck straight in. Who’s down there, then?\nALBERTINE: The Punch and Judy man is setting up. There’s a family unpacking their rug and their tea things.\nTOBY: What are they eating?\nALBERTINE: Sandwiches, I think. Oh, what a lovely girl. What sweet little curls. And there’s Lafayette the confidence man. He has a new walking cane.\nTOBY: Oh yes?\nALBERTINE: Duck-headed, silver.\nTOBY: He must have had a good night at the Kursaal.\nALBERTINE: Solidago’s competition still hasn’t opened yet.\nTOBY: What's the point in setting up a new ice cream kiosk if you’re going to keep it closed up?\nALBERTINE: Pointless, I agree.\nTOBY: Who else?\nALBERTINE: There’s a man in a deckchair with a huge pile of books, all wrapped in brown paper. He’s not exactly dressed for the beach. Spats the colour of a poison bottle, yellow trousers, striped.\nTOBY: Like a humbug.\nALBERTINE: Hmm. And he’s eating a piece of cake.\nTOBY: What kind?\nALBERTINE: Battenberg. It matches the pattern of his waistcoat.\nPERI: Ah. I missed you at breakfast.\nDOCTOR: Ah well, I had to put these under plain brown wrapper. The last four volumes haven't been published yet. It wouldn’t do to be caught in possession of an anachronistic novel.\nPERI: Mmm. Leave it accidentally on a trolley bus, and you might unravel the whole causal nexus.\nDOCTOR: Well, exactly.\nPERI: I’m surprised you haven’t read it before.\nDOCTOR: Oh, my first incarnation, he was the real Francophile. He, I, ordered it from Foyles, but never seemed to get past page 20, what with all those Mire beasts and Moroks and whatnot. And after that, well, my last few incarnations haven't been great bibliomaniacs. The third one, he was more interested in axle grease and looking in the mirror than the French classics. And as for my immediate predecessor.\nPERI: What about him?\nDOCTOR: Well, he preferred cricket and fizzy lemonade to reading. Unless, of course, it was a Boys Own yarn about some yah-yah aristocrat yomping through the Brazilian rain forest, depriving the natives of their orchids.\nPERI: I’ve read that. It’s not such a bad book. Apart from the bit where they spit-roast his dog.\nDOCTOR: Y’know, Peri, I think I’m lucky to have finally found myself a persona with sufficient sensitivity to appreciate Proust, and the patience to understand that it pays to take a holiday in order to read him. You can understand that, can’t you?\nPERI: Just.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nPERI: You know the guy gets hit by a car at the beginning of the last volume.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Peri.\nPERI: You don’t need to be a Time Lord to appreciate A La Recherche du Temps Perdu. I read it in my gap year.\nDOCTOR: What did you think?\nPERI: I think he needed a better editor.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nPERI: There’s a character, that artist who drops dead in the middle of the second volume, and then turns up again in the third.\nDOCTOR: Happens to the best of us.\nPERI: That sort of thing’s okay in real life, but it shouldn’t happen in fiction. I'll leave you alone with your book. I’m off to buy some postcards.\nDOCTOR: Huh? Who do you know in this time zone?\nPERI: Herbert Wells.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nPERI: Now there’s a writer who didn’t have any problems with continuity. When people die in his books, they stay dead. Usually.\nALBERTINE: Right on time.\nTOBY: Let’s go through the bill.\nALBERTINE: One pot of Darjeeling. One crystal bowl of sherbet bon-bons, lemon and strawberry ones. One dish of macadamia nuts and dried figs. One plate of cucumber sandwiches.\nTOBY: Crusts?\nALBERTINE: Guillotined. Escoffier couldn’t have cut them more cleanly.\nTOBY: Escoffier had people to do that for him.\nALBERTINE: They’ve forgotten the shortbread. Should I ring down?\nTOBY: I think you’d better. I need something sugary to keep me alive until elevenses. I had the most terrible dream last night.\nALBERTINE: You squealed as if someone had stuck a hat-pin up you.\nTOBY: I dreamt I was standing at the door of Ma and Pa’s cottage. Ma was rummaging in the pocket of her apron for a peppermint. Pa was tapping his briar on the heel of his boot, and letting the tobacco fall on the crazy paving.\nALBERTINE: Briar?\nTOBY: It’s a sort of pipe.\nALBERTINE: Ah.\nTOBY: I could hear the bees buzzing in the tea-roses, birds twittering away in the hawthorn, the full bucolic caboodle.\nALBERTINE: It doesn’t sound very traumatic.\nTOBY: Ah, but then they went. Or I went. Ma was waving her handkerchief in the air and I could see a tear rolling down her great black cheek. And I was crying too, but it wasn’t because I was waving goodbye to them. It was because I was suddenly flat on my back, with lights shining in my eyes. I was trying to move but there were dirty great metal cuffs around my arms and legs. And then I saw the doctor. And then I woke up. And I was glad about that.\nALBERTINE: You knocked over the fruit bowl, blood oranges all over the carpet.\nTOBY: You know, it’d be such a pleasure to go down to the beach for a few hours, dip my toes in the surf, knock up a few sandcastles, hire out one of those dear little deck chairs, treat myself to a bottle of lemonade, perhaps one of those nice dressed lobsters that Monsieur Hofraff sometimes sends us.\nALBERTINE: Why don't you, then? Who knows us here? If you wrapped up and we pulled down the hood on the bath chair, nobody would know. Nobody would be any the wiser.\nTOBY: But you never know who might be waiting down there. Fans pestering for autographs, an assassin ready to run me through. A paddle in the Channel’s not worth the risk. Particularly when I might end up dead, with an apple in my mouth. Do we have any apples?\nALBERTINE: I'll send for some. And for that shortbread. (picks up phone) Ahoy? Suite 139 speaking. I have an amendment to our ten o’clock order.\nTOBY: Pippins, please, if they’ve got them.\nDOCTOR: Do you mind, madam? I was reading.\nALICE: What, with your eyes shut? You should go on the stage.\nDOCTOR: My eyes were not shut. Can I do anything for you?\nALICE: You can, as a matter of fact. My windbreak has toppled over, and I was wondering whether you’d mind awfully\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, of course. There you are, that should do it. Funny, I didn’t hear it fall\nALICE: You were asleep.\nDOCTOR: Or you lowered the thing to the ground in order to have an excuse to talk to me.\nALICE: Ah, so you’re not so dozy after all.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad to hear you say so.\nALICE: May I introduce myself? Miss Alice Bultitude. I believe I have spotted you and your, er, companion in the breakfast room of the Hotel Palace Thermae.\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, I\nALICE: It’s no use lying, you know. You’re stuck with me now. I Know we’re neighbours. This is where you introduce yourself.\nDOCTOR: Madam.\nALICE: It’s Miss.\nDOCTOR: Miss. Very pleased to meet you. I’m the Doctor.\nALICE: How fascinating. I pride myself on my knowledge of the theatrical profession and its allied arts.\nDOCTOR: Oh, do you?\nALICE: I profess a passionate interest in the conjurers, prestidigitators, prodigies and funambulists of Europe, and yet your nom-de-guerre is not familiar to me.\nDOCTOR: Well, my work has been a little further afield.\nALICE: The colonies.\nDOCTOR: Frequently. Do you know a place called Varos?\nALICE: Of course. It’s one of the Andaman Islands. Well, you do get about. But, you know, I still think it’s very strange that I don’t recognise you.\nDOCTOR: Well, the likenesses on the posters are never much cop, are they?\nALICE: Ah, there now I agree with you. I once secured an audience with Professor Osiris. Do you know him? Terrible old charlatan with a useless clairvoyant act. Whistles up people’s dead mothers and peddles meaningless messages to the recently bereaved. Look in the antimacassar drawer for a clue to the whereabouts of the missing emeralds, guff of that kind.\nDOCTOR: I’m not familiar with his work, but I know the type.\nALICE: There’s a full thirty years between the photograph he sends out in the post and the wreck of a man who totters out into the limelight twice nightly. And his real name is Hamish Legg.\nDOCTOR: And I'll bet he’s not a real Professor, either.\nALICE: Never trust a man with a title, Doctor. This business is full of frauds, isn’t it? You never quite know whether people are who they say they are, which makes the genuine articles all the more alluring, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I suppose so.\nALICE: Oh look, there’s a man out at sea waving to us. Hello-oo.\nCHARDALOT: (distant) Help!\nDOCTOR: He’s not waving.\nALBERTINE: Something’s happening down on the beach. Right hoo-ha.\nTOBY: What species of hoo-ha?\nALBERTINE: It’s Battenburg. He’s taking his waistcoat off. And his shirt. Oh heavens. And he’s running towards the water.\nTOBY: Why?\nALBERTINE: Oh, I see. There’s a man in trouble, about a hundred yards from the shoreline. Battenburg’s swimming out to him.\nTOBY: How’s he doing?\nALBERTINE: Not doing badly. He’s puffing away. He looks like a big blond cormorant.\nTOBY: Who’s the man in trouble?\nALBERTINE: Nobody I recognise. Large frame, striped bathing costume, what a moustache. Oh, he’s gone!\nTOBY: Gone where?\nALBERTINE: Under the water. Can’t see him. And now Battenburg’s sunk down to find him. I don’t fancy his chances.\nTOBY: Change the scanning mode.\nALBERTINE: Oh, er\nTOBY: Push the two brass buttons by the viewfinder.\nALBERTINE: Oh yes. Just like the show we saw at the Westminster Aquarium. Was he from Fiji, that boy?\nTOBY: Madagascar. What’s happening?\nALBERTINE: Battenburg has the other man in his arms, and he’s dragging him back to the surface. He looks as if he’s about to explode.\nTOBY: I wonder how this little maritime melodrama is going to turn out? Did room service send up those apples?\nALBERTINE: Yes, but they couldn't find any Pippins, only a sorry handful of Golden Reinettes. They’re a bit bruised, I’m afraid.\nTOBY: How I miss the orchards of England.\nALBERTINE: Oh, there’s a woman on the beach with an animal under her arm. A little monkey of some sort. Ah ha. It’s wearing a bridal gown. I think we know what that must be.\nTOBY: She’s bought one of Madame Ensor’s creations.\nALBERTINE: I wonder where she’s taking it?\nPERI: Where is he?\nALICE: He?\nPERI: The Doctor, where is he? You're holding his waistcoat.\nALICE: Saving a man’s life, or dying in the attempt, young lady. No, not that way. Over there, look. There he is.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Peri. Peri, did you ever\nPERI: What?\nDOCTOR: Do your St John Ambulance?\nPERI: No.\nDOCTOR: Then improvise. There’s a man here needs your help.\nPERI: Okay.\nPERI: There you go. Okay?\nALICE: There’s a doctor coming from the hotel. Don’t worry, the Punch and Judy man is running for one. I hope he doesn’t swallow his swozzle. (laughs)\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. Oh, well done, Peri.\nCHARDALOT: I knew a girl who kissed like you. Marie LeFevre, the trunk murderess of Saint Germain. Strangled her victims with the cord of her silk dressing gown, but they all went happily to the grave. (coughs) Or I should say, to the left-luggage department of the Gare du Nord.\nPERI: Excuse me?\nCHARDALOT: My thanks, Mademoiselle. You have just saved the life of Inspector Alphonse Chardalot. The cut-purses and apache of Paris will be obliged to celebrate some other day.\nALBERTINE: Herr Beaker is running from the hotel. I’ve never seen him move so fast. He'll have a child’s eye out with that stethoscope.\nTOBY: So all’s well, then. Everyone’s lived to fight another day. I’m glad. Couldn’t bear to watch anyone drown, could you?\nALBERTINE: It’s never done that before. I'll print off the reading. Means nothing to me.\nTOBY: Pass it here. It’s him. The telescope has detected him.\nALBERTINE: It can’t be, surely.\nTOBY: Who else?\nALBERTINE: But we took such care.\nTOBY: Our persecutor has iron determination. He’s a monster. There’s no other word for it. The Doctor is here, and he’s come to stick me.\nALBERTINE: Well, we’d better make plans. Where do you fancy next? Eastbourne? Brighton? They'll do us a good deal at the Grand. A room near the lift, if we’re lucky.\nTOBY: I’m not sure, Nurse Albertine. We must prepare for darker possibilities. Let us spend this night as if it were our last. We need entertainment, and we need to look our best. Check with reception that our packing case has arrived, fetch my wig from the barouche stand, bring the pot of lightener number 5. If the human race is to end tonight, at least its last member can die beautiful.\nALICE: No, no, I insist. Hot brandy’s what you need.\nDOCTOR: A little rest is what I need.\nPERI: Good tip, Miss Bultitude. It'll wash the brine out of his lungs.\nALICE: I have an excellent bottle in my knitting basket. Shall 1?\nPERI: Oh, we wouldn’t dream of it. That’s what room service is for. Now, we’ll see you at dinner, won’t we?\nALICE: Oh yes, but I think my bottle will be rather better than the washy variety they dole out here.\nPERI: Oh, we'll manage.\nALICE: As you wish.\nPERI: Until dinner, then.\nALICE: Yes, yes, of course.\nPERI: So what was really going on out there? Our friend was half-dead when you pulled him from the water, but when he came round it was like he’d just woken up from his afternoon nap.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I felt as if I was the one being rescued. By rights I think I ought to have drowned out there. Why weren't his things on the beach?\nPERI: And he had no deck chair and no other clothes.\nDOCTOR: I dare say we'll find out soon enough. What is that thing?\nPERI: Some one left it for me at reception. Cute, isn’t she? The wedding gear really sets off her fur.\nDOCTOR: Was there a billet-doux attached?\nPERI: Yeah. Doesn’t say much, though.\nDOCTOR: To Miss Brown with admiration and thanks.\nPERI: I'll say I’m washing my hair.\nDOCTOR: Good idea.\nPERI: She’s a macaque, isn’t she?\nDOCTOR: Rhesus macaque. They have a bit of a reputation. I once saw one bite the Bishop of Winchester and steal his umbrella.\nPERI: Ooo.\nDOCTOR: People make pets of them and then don’t treat them well.\nPERI: Well, I think this one’s beyond the help of the American Humane Association. Unless the groom wants her back?\nDOCTOR: Or unless it’s an alien ambassador who’s been shocked into silence by our bad manners.\nPERI: Well, go on, then.\nDOCTOR: Welcome to the planet Earth, your Excellency. Don’t hit her like that.\nPERI: She’s not complaining.\nDOCTOR: I suppose that’s one way of settling the matter.\nPERI: Satisfied?\nDOCTOR: It always pays to be safe. I think some of her sawdust just came out on my eiderdown.\nPERI: Can’t we just bin it? Gives me the creeps.\nDOCTOR: Really? That’s a bit rich, coming from someone who recently spent an afternoon being turned into a parakeet. That poor monkey could just as easily have been you.\nPERI: Oh gee thanks, Doctor. This thing makes me think of what they were up to in the zoology lab on campus. Every time I went past that building I’d feel glad that I’d taken the botany course.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, can’t say I’d want it on the mantelpiece.\nPERI: I'll get that.\nPERI: Oh, hi. Thanks. Really? Oh, well, yeah. Are you working later? Anyway, see ya. Bye. (door closes) It’s an invitation.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nPERI: Inspector Alphonse Chardalot begs the pleasure of our company at dinner tonight.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well, perhaps we'll see the rest of the macaques in the dining room.\nALICE: Operator, Ostend 583 please.\nOPERATOR: [OC]: Connecting you now, madame.\nALICE: Thank you.\nMAN: [OC]: Bonjour.\nALICE: Miss Bultitude, Hotel Palace Thermae. Good afternoon. I have a commission for you. I have a large packing case for which I'd like to arrange transport on tomorrow's Dover ferry. Rather heavy, I’m afraid. Might need a few of your heftiest lads on the job.\nMAN: [OC]: Certainly, madame. We will despatch them immediately.\nALICE: Thank you. I’m much obliged.\nMAN: [OC]: Au revoir.\nALBERTINE: Up the main stairs, then take the third corridor on the right.\nALICE: You too, eh?\nALBERTINE: I beg your pardon?\nALICE: The fees are exorbitant, aren’t they? But if you want it doing properly, you have to hire the best. No use going home and jemmying the thing open and finding a pile of broken all-sorts.\nALBERTINE: Oh, the crate, you mean.\nALICE: Yes, I was just arranging for a rather interesting addition to my collection to be shipped back home to England, and your two men... mmm, must be something heavy.\nALBERTINE: Yes.\nALICE: And something rather precious.\nALBERTINE: Yes.\nALICE: Oh, do tell me.\nALBERTINE: It’s a kinematograph, and some reels of film.\nALICE: How marvellous. I do adore the flickers. Have you been to the kinema at the Korsaal?\nALBERTINE: Er, no.\nALICE: The programme changes daily. Yesterday it was the Strength and Agility of Insects. All those talented bluebottles lying on their backs and juggling with champagne corks. Today it’s Zeb Zack and the Zulus. Doesn’t sound quite so thrilling, though the poster did promise ten minutes of white-hot excitement on the open veldt. Who’s your favourite, then? Rover? I used to adore him. Jack Sprat’s parrot, what a bird.\nALBERTINE: I’m keener on actualities, actually.\nALICE: Oh. Views of Vienna Cathedral, that sort of thing. Well, each to her own. Personally I like anything with a few animals larking about and causing mischief.\nCHARDALOT: Dear lady.\nALBERTINE: Do excuse me. I must see this safely delivered.\nCHARDALOT: Dear lady, I was just coming down to reception to see if my luggage had arrived, but you have provided me with a most welcome distraction.\nALICE: You're feeling better then, I take it, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: Your Doctor Beaker gave me the once-over and pronounced me fit as a flea.\nALICE: Fleas drink blood, you know.\nCHARDALOT: Ah yes, like Martin Dumollard of evil memory.\nALICE: The Vampire of Paris.\nCHARDALOT: Precisely.\nALICE: So, you're fit for action again, eh? Ready to start bashing up the jewel thieves and garrotters. You're here on a case, aren't you. Don’t tell me, one of the guests is some terrible butcher from the slums of Paris.\nCHARDALOT: You say more than you know, Miss Bultitude, but I am not yet ready to reveal my purpose here. In the mean time I should like to thank you for your part in saving my life. Would you do me the honour of dining with me this evening?\nALICE: Why, I'd be delighted, but I’m already promised to the Doctor and Miss Brown.\nCHARDALOT: And I have no intention of spending the evening without them.\nCHARDALOT: And if it hadn’t been for me, Gilbert Dechard would have swung on the scaffold. There were drops of silver nitrate found on the wife’s dress, you see.\nDOCTOR: Ah ha.\nCHARDALOT: Dechard was a keen amateur photographer, so most of my colleagues, and the press,\nCHARDALOT: assumed that the chemical had come from his dark room. But I was there when the brother-in-law was told the news of Elodie‘s murder. The news affected him so powerfully that he pitched backwards onto the floor. Everyone felt terribly sorry for him. Not I. I know an epileptic seizure when I see one. I Know that some old quacks prescribe silver nitrate to cure the condition, and I noticed that the brother-in-law’s tongue had a slightly blue tinge, so I clapped him in handcuffs before he regained consciousness.\nDOCTOR: Well done. Silver nitrate, eh? I'd never have thought of that.\nCHARDALOT: I have two butlers at home. I discuss everything with them. They are my sounding-boards, the brains of the operation.\nALICE: I imagine you didn’t need them to catch the brother-in-law in the Dechard case.\nCHARDALOT: No, dear lady. I admit that was all my own work.\nALICE: Miss Brown, I noticed on the beach today that you’d brought a little friend with you. A hairy one.\nPERI: Oh, yeah. A present from an unknown admirer.\nALICE: Can you cast any light on this, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: Me? I know nothing of such matters.\nALICE: Well, I do. It was one of Madame Ensor’s toys, I fancy.\nDOCTOR: Ensor? What, the painter’s wife? Sister?\nALICE: His mother. She keeps a shop on Kapucijnenstraat. Junk for tourists. Kabuki masks, decorated fans, Yoruba carvings of Kaiser Wilhelm. She has an ostrich egg that she says produced enough meat to make an omelette for the entire household of the Count of Flanders. She'll spin any old story to make a sale.\nPERI: And she makes these things herself, does she? Sits up all night sewing wedding veils for primates?\nALICE: Ah ha, now that I can’t say. The story she tells is that she inherited her stock from the collection of the last Margrave of Meissen. Says that he had 58 of the little creatures procured as a present to his mistress. Had them nailed into a diorama for her with stained glass windows and banyan trees and all.\nPERI: I'd love to have seen her face when she pulled off the gift wrap.\nCHARDALOT: The madness of love, Miss Brown, drives men to all kinds of incomprehensible action.\nPERI: Hmm.\nCHARDALOT: I remember a case, a bad business. Fellow ended up on a slab in the Paris Morgue. But it’s not a story to be told over coffee and petit-fours.\nDOCTOR: (slightly drunk) Did I ever tell you story of the giant rat of the River Fleet? I wonder if the world is ready yet for it. Ouch! Peri. What are you kicking me for?\nCHARDALOT: Nowhere in the world, Doctor, has bred more muscular and vicious vermin than the catacombs of Paris. I remember when I pursued Henri Lacroix - how hateful the name remains — into that brick-built Hades. He may be still down there for all I know, doing his obeisance at the court of the great Rat King.\nALICE: Well, I think it might be time for Miss Brown and myself to take a little turn around the terrace, particularly if you intend to light that cigar, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: I’m afraid that I must. It’s been quite a day. A brush with death should always be followed by a little taste of Havana.\nALICE: If you’ll excuse us then.\nPERI: Right. See you later, guys.\nCHARDALOT: So, Doctor, the ladies have deserted us. It’s just you, me, and this rather attractive decanter of port. (lights cigar)\nDOCTOR: Not bad, is it? (pours) Na zdorovie.\nCHARDALOT: You know, I was walking on the promenade this afternoon when I saw the most peculiar thing.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nCHARDALOT: A large blue box with a lamp on top, just next to Solidago’s ice cream kiosk. Some item of Police equipment, by the look of it, but I rang the boys in the Ostend station and they couldn't tell me anything about it. That’s odd, don’t you think?\nDOCTOR: Very odd. Perhaps it belongs to Solidago.\nCHARDALOT: No. He says it appeared three days ago. The only person he’s seen anywhere near it is Miss Brown. He says she spent half an hour standing inside the thing yesterday afternoon. She has a key to it, apparently.\nDOCTOR: Bathing hut, then. I'll ask her about it in the morning. Well, what are you doing here, Inspector? You’re not on holiday, are you, hmm? This is business, isn’t it?\nCHARDALOT: I’m here to investigate a murder.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Whose?\nCHARDALOT: I don’t know. It hasn’t happened yet.\nDOCTOR: But you already know who the killer is, hmm?\nCHARDALOT: You read me like a book, Doctor. I feel like a volume of Proust.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know his work?\nCHARDALOT: Well, only Swann’s Way, naturally. What do you think of it? Have you any sympathy with the hero? To me he seems, well, a mimsy, ingratiating, spineless little snob.\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s something bothering me about the book, actually. You see, there’s this character, an artist. No. No, it can’t be. I don’t believe it.\nCHARDALOT: What?\nDOCTOR: Over there, having dinner at the corner table.\nCHARDALOT: Who is he?\nDOCTOR: That’s only Marcel Proust.\nCHARDALOT: No! Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: Positive. Oh, I'd no idea he was staying here.\nCHARDALOT: Careful, Doctor. They put breakages on the bill.\nDOCTOR: Oi, Marcel. I’ve got a bone to pick with you.\nPERI: Ah, it’s a beautiful night, isn’t it?\nALICE: A good night for lying through your teeth. A good night for mendacity.\nPERI: I’m sorry?\nALICE: Well, what a dreadful old fraud. Silver nitrate indeed. Half the details were wrong.\nPERI: About the Inspector’s case, you mean?\nALICE: And everything else too, I shouldn’t wonder. The silver nitrate wasn’t the Dashard business. That was Professor Menlaux and that chorus girl. Our Inspector is as fishy as a Grimsby herring lugger. Fishier!\nPERI: What is he, then? A fantasist? A con artist?\nALICE: Both. Indubitably. You meet lots of them at the seaside, especially on this side of the Channel. They're all here. Plausible bigamists, the more successful type of poisoner, unspeakables of the Oscar Wilde sort.\nPERI: Oh dear.\nALICE: Well, they brighten up the place, don’t they? Without that lot, Ostend and Dieppe would be killing, wouldn't they? Just oldies like me eating cake and gossiping about dead people.\nPERI: I guess.\nALICE: Oh, it would be frightful. But a word of advice, dear. Look but don’t touch. Men like that are all very well as a kind of sport for spectators, like shot-putting or ratting or bare-knuckle boxing, but never say yes to a man in an astrakhan collar.\nPERI: I'll try to remember that.\nALICE: To think that you gave him the kiss of life.\nPERI: His breath smelt of tobacco and garlic, and I swallowed some of that salty water from his lungs.\nALICE: Yes, he might have spared you that.\nPERI: So, what’s his racket, then?\nALICE: Eh?\nPERI: What’s he up to? Why stage his own drowning? Why the detective shtick?\nALICE: And why affect to be ignorant of the art of Madame Ensor?\nPERI: She’s famous, is she?\nALICE: Well, not exactly, but he knew much more than he was saying. You see, Miss Brown, just as I was coming out to the beach this morning, I saw a gentleman at the reception desk leaving that present for you.\nPERI: Was this a large gentleman with a waxed moustache, by any chance?\nALICE: Indeed.\nPERI: Wait a minute. What time was this?\nALICE: Yes, that’s the peculiar thing, isn’t it. I left the lobby before him and went straight down to the sand, but I’d only been talking to the Doctor for a couple of minutes before I spotted our friend again, several hundred yards out to sea and in considerable trouble.\nPERI: Well, that clinches it, doesn’t it? If you get a message of thanks before you do your good deed, it kind of suggests the whole thing is a scam.\nALICE: And not a very efficient one. No confidence man would make such a preposterous error. Perhaps Chardalot is one of the criminal lunatics whom he boasts of clapping in handcuffs? Perhaps the remains of the real Inspector are festering in the scrag bin of some charcuterie in the 13\" Arondissement?\nPERI: Great. Well, even if they were, that doesn’t explain how he has the ability to be in two places at once.\nALICE: Nor the coincidence that he’s here at the same time as another rather extraordinary guest.\nPERI: Oh? Who's that?\nALICE: I'll introduce you to him later, once I’ve been introduced to him myself. Now, perhaps it’s time we rejoined the gentlemen.\nCHARDALOT: Don’t worry, Doctor, I’m sure he'll forgive you.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me? Marcel Proust was one of the most notorious sensitive authors in the French canon. I wasn’t aware he ever left his bedroom long enough to have dinner in a restaurant. He wouldn’t even go to the theatre, you know, just lie there under his quilt and listen to the play being relayed over the telephone. And to think I grabbed him by the shoulders and called him Marcel.\nCHARDALOT: Well, yes.\nDOCTOR: Breathed port fumes up his nose.\nCHARDALOT: Yes.\nDOCTOR: And told him what I thought of Swann.\nCHARDALOT: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Ah, how embarrassing.\nCHARDALOT: Well, try not to give it too much thought, Doctor. You never know, the incident might end up in a book!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I do hope not. That would get me into all kinds of trouble.\nCHARDALOT: Some more coffee, perhaps. There’s plenty in the pot.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Oh, I'll pay for this in the morning. I'll have the Numskulls playing the Anvil Chorus on the inside of my head.\nCHARDALOT: The Numskulls?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you ever read the Beezer?\nCHARDALOT: Er, no.\nPERI: Ahem. Have we missed something? Everybody's looking at us.\nCHARDALOT: Nothing at all, Miss Brown. Just a little literary discussion. And the after dinner mints, I’m sorry to say. I’m afraid I let my sweet tooth get the better of me.\nALICE: No matter. I think it might be time we turned in. Thank you all for a very charming evening. I’m so glad you didn’t drown today, Inspector. I should have missed a very entertaining dinner.\nCHARDALOT: I’m glad you enjoyed it. I feel full of life. I might have a quick trot down the promenade before bed. Anyone care to join me? Miss Brown? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, why not.\nPERI: No, thank you, Inspector. The Doctor and I have to be up early in the morning. We’re trying some of those new sulphur treatments, aren’t we.\nDOCTOR: So we are.\nCHARDALOT: Well, until the morning, then.\nALICE: And in the morning (yawns) we should\nPERI: Are you all right, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: I’m sorry. I’m sorry to ask, but might you accompany me to my room? I’m afraid I’ve had... well, I’d appreciate a steadying arm, if you didn’t mind.\nPERI: Of course not. Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Goodnight, Inspector. Enjoy the moonlight.\nCHARDALOT: Waiter, would I be right in thinking that the nearest telephone was in the lobby?\nWAITER: No, Monsieur. There is one just there, by the cloakroom.\nCHARDALOT: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure we’re going the right way? This part of the hotel doesn’t look very lived in.\nALICE: I know. Half the light bulbs have gone.\nPERI: Are they giving you a special rate?\nALICE: Eh? No, I think they're overcharging me. They slip the extra odd bread roll onto the bill just before you sign for it.\nDOCTOR: So this isn’t where you’re staying. Miss Bultitude, what are you up to exactly?\nALICE: Doctor, Miss Brown, I have a confession to make.\nPERI: I knew something like this was coming.\nDOCTOR: You weren’t feeling remotely ill, were you. That was a trick to get us up here.\nALICE: That's true. As a matter of fact, I never felt better.\nDOCTOR: So what's the object of this excursion, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: There’s someone in this hotel I’d very much like you to meet. Well, not a person, exactly. An individual. I’ve followed him halfway across Europe, but now I’ve tracked him down, and I need you to be witnesses to his presence here, to prove that he actually exists.\nPERI: That sounds worse than I expected.\nALICE: Listen.\nTOBY: [OC]: It was such a beautiful, beautiful world, Nurse Albertine. Such a civilisation, and all lost. Centuries of human thought and achievement destroyed by the careless action of a few selfish ingrates.\nALICE: Are you ready?\nDOCTOR: For what?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they don’t want to be disturbed.\nALICE: I can’t bear the suspense any longer. I’m going to open the door.\nALICE: I knew it. I knew it.\nTOBY: Who are you? Who are you? What are you? What do you want? I didn’t say you could come in. Ah!\nTOBY: Ah!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry for the intrusion. We shouldn't have barged in on you.\nTOBY: Albertine! Albertine!\nALICE: Mister Toby, I am Alice Bultitude, your most faithful admirer.\nTOBY: Eh?\nPERI: Doctor, he’s a...\nDOCTOR: Yes, so I see.\nTOBY: Doctor, it’s you, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nTOBY: Albertine, wide beam impulse, immediately!\nDOCTOR: Oh, how curious. That’s a kind of cattle-prod, is\nTOBY: Thank you. Thank you, Nurse Albertine. I don’t know what I... When they came in I\nALBERTINE: There wasn’t much left in the power cell. They'll sleep for a few hours, that’s all.\nTOBY: Still, three with one shot without damaging the upholstery. That’s good work.\nALBERTINE: Thank you.\nTOBY: Now, Nurse Albertine, we have another problem. Do we keep them prisoner, or eat the evidence?\nCHARDALOT: Good morning, Miss Brown.\nPERI: (waking) Oh, Inspector. Why are you in my bedroom?\nCHARDALOT: There’s no impropriety, Miss Brown. I am not alone.\nPERI: I feel terrible.\nCHARDALOT: Hardly surprising. At four this morning, you were discovered unconscious at the bottom of the laundry chute.\nPERI: What?\nCHARDALOT: More or less unharmed, happily. Your fall was broken by a basket of other people’s dirty linen.\nPERI: What about the Doctor and Miss Bultitude?\nCHARDALOT: Our friends, I’m sorry to say, have completely disappeared.\nPERI: Disappeared?\nCHARDALOT: The hotel is being searched. I have spoken with the manager. I will spend this morning interviewing the staff, but I think you are the most important witness. Now, what can you recall of what happened after I left you last night? Anything might help.\nPERI: Last thing I remember, I was walking down the corridors with the Doctor and Miss Bultitude, complaining about the lighting. She was leading us astray. We weren’t anywhere near her room. We were in some part of the hotel that looked like it was closed to visitors. Then it’s all a mess. All I remember is the dream I had after I passed out.\nCHARDALOT: Go on.\nPERI: It’s not important.\nCHARDALOT: Try me.\nPERI: Okay. Well, there was a pig, and it was sitting in an armchair, eating potato chips and watching a movie. He was sobbing his heart out.\nCHARDALOT: What kind of... movie?\nPERI: I don’t think it had much of a plot. It was about pigs. There was a pig doing the Yorick speech from Hamlet, or he had a ruff and a skull, anyway. There were a couple of pigs sitting at a café table, and... is this of any use or are you just having a laugh at my expense?\nCHARDALOT: I’ve seen one by Meéliés a bit like that. Didn’t have any space rockets, did it?\nPERI: Not that I remember. Oh, I feel quite sick.\nCHARDALOT: We'd better leave you to sleep it off, Miss Brown. I’ve arranged for someone to attend you. The good Samarian who found you this morning was a private nurse retained by one of the guests. Her employer has kindly given her leave to attend to you for a few hours. I’m sorry, Madame, I don’t Know your name.\nALBERTINE: Albertine, sir. Nurse Albertine.\nTOBY: That camp bed’s a bit rickety. I’d be careful as you get off it.\nALICE: I’ve slept in worse places. Oh! I feel terribly strange. What happened to me?\nTOBY: Your arrival was most unexpected.\nALICE: But not unwelcome.\nTOBY: I let you stay over, didn’t I?\nALICE: Well, yes, I suppose you did.\nTOBY: Now, we don't have visitors here very often. I usually have someone to do this for me - my nurse — but she has more important duties to perform today, so I must be mother. (pours tea) Now, the milk goes in after the tea, yes?\nALICE: Er, yes. (sips) Yuck! It’s also customary to heat up the water first.\nTOBY: There you are. I knew I’d get something wrong.\nALICE: May I?\nTOBY: Be my guest.\nALICE: Here’s the hot water. Let’s put it back on the trivet for a moment, eh? One should only put the milk in first, you know, if one is drinking from inferior china that is likely to crack when the tea goes in. I think we can trust the Hotel Palace Thermae not to have done things on the cheap.\nTOBY: Splendid. Would you mind buttering a few muffins while you're at it?\nALICE: Of course.\nTOBY: And tucking in my napkin?\nALICE: My pleasure, Mister...\nTOBY: You may call me Toby, just as you did in your letters, Miss Bultitude.\nALICE: So you received them.\nTOBY: Of course. I have many admirers, but none as persistent as you.\nALICE: You'll have to forgive me, but I can’t quite remember how...\nTOBY: You called upon me last night. You were a little overcome. The heat of the room, no doubt.\nALICE: I’ve been here for weeks, you know, waiting for a chance to speak with you. I followed you from Paris to Brussels to Antwerp to here. Followed you across half of Europe. Er, but not in a sinister way.\nTOBY: What drove you to it, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: I love your work. I have all your cartes de visite, even the early ones from when you wore the dog collar. I have a first edition of your memoirs, inscribed by Hippolyte Fullerlove.\nTOBY: Fullerlove. The worst agent in Europe.\nALICE: I was there on the opening night of your first European tour, back in ’88 at the Winter Gardens in Berlin, front row of the stalls. Wouldn’t have missed it for the world.\nTOBY: Oh yes, I remember that night. Professor Prometheus, the Fireproof Circassian, the Incomparable Hildebrand, the Blondin Donkey. What a bill. You don’t get turns like that anymore. Not since the Kinematograph. Thank you very much, Mister Lumiére.\nALICE: And I was there at your farewell concert.\nTOBY: Oh yes. The Blackcastle Alhambra. Not my finest hour.\nALICE: They should have been ashamed of themselves!\nTOBY: You don’t think they expected me to eat those vegetables, do you? (laughs) Well, it’s all over now. Those days are gone. You know what the manager said to me on the way out? The bottom’s dropped out of the freak show, guv. Freak show? We were prodigies, marvels.\nALICE: Some of us have not forgotten, you know. The name of Toby the Sapient Pig will live in history.\nTOBY: I’m astonished to hear you say so, Miss Bultitude. And of all the emotions, it’s astonishment that sharpens my appetite most keenly. Would you ring down to the kitchen and order some more brioche? And some apricot jam.\nALICE: What was that?\nTOBY: Just the hotel settling, perhaps, or your friend the Doctor waking up and falling from the divan in the next room.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: Oh!\nTOBY: Is there any tea left in the pot?\nALBERTINE: Beef tea, Miss. That'll sort you out.\nPERI: Will it?\nALBERTINE: You’re not English, are you.\nPERI: American.\nALBERTINE: Ah. That explains it. My father was from the Isle of Thanet. I’ve never been there but it sounds very romantic, doesn’t it? He was mad for beef tea. He used to tell me that if you plotted General Buller’s advance on Ladysmith, it spelled out the word Bovril on the map.\nPERI: That’s a new one to me.\nALBERTINE: The name comes from a book, you know, Bovril. About a race of people from another civilisation. They fly about the place and have guns that fire beams of light, and bombs that can destroy entire cities, and they live on this stuff, Vrilia, like a kind of nectar. Keeps them alive.\nPERI: In that case, I'll drink it.\nALBERTINE: You’re here on holiday with your husband?\nPERI: The Doctor, you mean? He’s not my husband. We’re not even\nALBERTINE: Don’t worry, you don’t have to explain it. If you’re the morganatic Mrs Brown, your secret is safe with me.\nPERI: No, it’s not like that. We’re friends, sort of.\nALBERTINE: On the road together, eh?\nPERI: Yeah.\nALBERTINE: It can be a lonely business. The packing and the unpacking, the railway station dinner. Has he ever thought of retiring?\nPERI: The Doctor? He doesn’t do retiring. Even when he tries to take time out he’s always... well, this was supposed to be a reading week. I just wish I knew what had happened to him.\nALBERTINE: You think he might be in danger?\nPERI: He usually is. But we’ve been here six days and nothing remotely sinister has happened. I suppose it was too good to last.\nALBERTINE: Have you been with him long?\nPERI: Couple of years, I think. It’s hard to keep track.\nALBERTINE: I know that feeling. All the waiters and porters look the same after a while.\nPERI: So, who am I depriving of your services today? I’m not feeling so bad now if you need to run back.\nALBERTINE: I think my patient can cope without me for a little longer. He has visitors today. As long as he has someone to cut up his tea bread and listen to his stories, he doesn’t really mind who’s there with him. I’m one of a long line. I’ve been with him for two years now, but so had some of the others.\nPERI: Would you leave him?\nALBERTINE: No, Miss, I don’t think so. We’ve got too accustomed to each other. I used to think about it, because it’s not always easy, the things I have to do sometimes, but I think I’ve forgotten how life was before. I don’t think I could go back to living in one place, the old routines. How about you, Miss?\nPERI: I don’t know. Maybe. The Doctor used to be a younger, happier man, but then he changed. (knock on door) Come in.\nCHARDALOT: Ladies. (door closes) How are you feeling, Miss Brown?\nPERI: Conscious. No need to send for the recorded message from Michael J Fox.\nCHARDALOT: Eh?\nPERI: Mainly I’m keen to find out what’s happened to the Doctor and Miss Bultitude.\nCHARDALOT: Excellent. Might you feel ready to sit out on the hotel terrace, and perhaps a spot of breakfast?\nPERI: At a push.\nCHARDALOT: Glad to hear it. Nurse Albertine, if you'll excuse us.\nALBERTINE: Of course.\nCHARDALOT: My enquiries have already started to bear fruit.\nALICE: Six crépes, lightly done, with anchovy cream and a quartered lemon. A basket of pain au chocolat. Six croissants nature. Acamembert and toast with the crusts cut off. Sugared pears. A radicle salad and some vinaigrette. Hot milk, frothed. A bag of peppermints.\nTOBY: Better make that two bags of peppermints. And anything you’d like, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, nothing for me, thanks. I’m still feeling a bit... How did I get here exactly?\nTOBY: Quiet, if you please, Doctor. Miss Bultitude is conducting some important business.\nALICE: Thank you. (phone down)\nDOCTOR: Did you invite us up here, sir?\nTOBY: No, Doctor. As a matter of fact, I didn’t.\nDOCTOR: Then might I ask why I woke up in your second-best bed?\nALICE: Well, er, that’s my fault, really, Doctor. I brought you and Miss Brown here to see... ah! And we’ve forgotten our manners, haven’t we. Doctor, may I introduce Toby the Sapient Pig, the celebrated stage performer.\nDOCTOR: Glad to meet you. Why don’t I remember meeting you last night?\nTOBY: You were a little worse for wear, Doctor. As host, I'll try not to be offended that you appear to have forgotten our little party.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, but... how very odd. And where’s Peri?\nTOBY: In her own room, I should imagine. It’s still quite early.\nALICE: Tea, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, I will.\nTOB: I’m glad you’re here, you know. My nurse, Albertine, has volunteered her services elsewhere. A young lady was taken ill last night. Met with an accident. It’s hard to find a good nurse in Ostend this time of year - so full of ill people — and her need was greater than mine.\nDOCTOR: Very selfless of you.\nTOBY: Well, to tell you the truth, I had a selfish motive. The young lady. I wanted to find out a little more about her, and the young man with whom she’s staying. I’d like to know what they’re doing here, who they are.\nDOCTOR: Pair of runaways, are they? Should we watch out for men in co-respondent shoes, maids feigning surprise?\nTOBY: Perhaps. I take an interest in what’s going on around me. Doctor, you have been led blindly to my\nTOBY: apartment, or so you say, but I’m rather curious about you, Miss Bultitude, and your motives for coming here.\nALICE: To see you, of course. I’m very curious about you.\nTOBY: Oh yes? In what way?\nALICE: I was hoping that you might agree to be interviewed for a book I’m writing, on the history of acts like yours, on the history of prodigies.\nTOBY: Oh. Whom else have you talked to?\nALICE: Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy, Madame Baboo, Krau the Missing Link.\nTOBY: Oh, the lobster-claw lady. I still have a shawl that she knitted for me. How is she?\nALICE: Getting by. Misses the old days. Misses you, I think.\nTOBY: Does she? That’s good. Who else?\nALICE: Chang Wu Gao.\nDOCTOR: Chang Wu Gao? The Chinese Giant?\nALICE: The very same.\nDOCTOR: I knew him. Marvellous fellow, very good dancer.\nALICE: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Retired to Bournemouth and opened a tea room. Had all the lintels taken up two feet. Used to walk around the town at night lighting his cigars on the street lamps. I haven’t thought about him for years.\nTOBY: Nor I. It seems we all have someone in common. Are you part of this research project, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. I thought I was escorting a sickly old lady to bed.\nTOBY: It’s odd, Doctor. When you first came into this room, I thought you were an old acquaintance, but now I’m sure that you know nothing of me. I must apologise for my vexatious reaction when you arrived.\nDOCTOR: No need to apologise. I don’t recall being offended.\nTOBY: So, Miss Bultitude. What would you like to know?\nALICE: I'd like to know... I’d like to Know if you are what you seem to be. I want to Know the secret of your act. I want to know if you are truly a... forgive me for using the word... a pig. And if you are such a person, how were you taught to walk upright and dress like a gentleman I would like to know if you truly know the future, and what you see.\nTOBY: And is there anything you wish to ask me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, er, well, er, Miss Bultitude’s enquiries will do for a start.\nTOBY: Let me answer your last question first, Miss Bultitude. I see death. I see blood, razors, barbed wire, cruelty, torture, rats, poison gas, boys dead in the mud with photographs of their mothers and sweethearts stowed next to their silent hearts. I see the blasted earth. I see the carcasses of horses, half-submerged in the slimy feculence. I see women weeping over fields of white-washed graves. I see war. War and revolution. I see a man in a white gown, a man with his knives and his drills and his syringes, getting down to work on my soft adipose tissue!\nTOBY: Please excuse me. I’m an entertainer. Never leaves you, really.\nDOCTOR: No.\nTOBY: And I see something else. Yes.\nALICE: What?\nTOBY: I see that the little electric light on the dumb waiter is illuminated, which means, Miss Bultitude, that if you would be so kind as to raise the shutter, you and I will both see a small pot of anchovy cream and numerous other comestibles that will keep us from death for another day. How’s your appetite, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Improving, since you ask. But I have a prior commitment. I really think I ought to be going back downstairs.\nTOBY: Not possible, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nTOBY: That door is locked from the outside. Little fad of mine. Your little incursion made me realise how insecure these apartments were. You can’t get out until my nurse returns. So sorry.\nCHARDALOT: Coffee for two, please. And please send a basket of madeleines to that rosy-cheeked gentleman over there, with our compliments.\nWAITER: At once, Monsieur Chardalot.\nPERI: Who’s that?\nCHARDALOT: Marcel Proust. He wrote a book about cake and people boring each other to death at dinner parties.\nPERI: I’ve read him.\nCHARDALOT: So has the Doctor. They had quite a scene together last night.\nPERI: Really? And what happened to them after that?\nCHARDALOT: Miss Brown, I propose to take you into my confidence. What I’m about to tell you may seem strange, but I'll try to convince you of the good nature of my motives. I’ll be honest with you. The drama of yesterday was a sham, a farrago.\nPERI: I’d already worked that one out. And the monkey?\nCHARDALOT: Yes, that was my doing.\nPERI: It’s not looking great from here, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: Miss Brown, I am on the trail of an extraordinarily dangerous individual. I have been pursuing him these last twenty years. He is devious and he is vicious. He is the foremost criminal mind of our generation. He has in his possession a weapon unknown to European science, an electrical device, something like a Roentgen ray. It immobilises its victims and robs them of their memories. The effect is rather like drinking a bottle of absinthe while placing a wet finger on the element of an electric stove. He has used it against me on a number of occasions. It is, I believe, the principle reason why he remains at liberty, and I think that last night you, and possibly the Doctor, fell under the influence of this device.\nPERI: And Miss Bultitude.\nCHARDALOT: Miss Bultitude, I suspect, was not forced to endure that experience. I am convinced that she is part of the conspiracy I am trying to expose.\nPERI: And why should I believe that?\nCHARDALOT: Miss Bultitude lied to you, did she not?\nPERI: She did. But she also said the same about you, that you’d lied about your cases.\nCHARDALOT: And did she produce any evidence?\nPERI: No.\nCHARDALOT: Well then.\nPERI: Mind you, she didn’t pretend to drown or send me a monkey.\nCHARDALOT: I needed to discover whether you and the Doctor were part of the conspiracy. I needed to gain your confidence. What better way to foster the spirit of comradeship than an act of selfless daring? Have you ever read The Woman in White?\nPERI: No.\nCHARDALOT: In the opening chapter, the hero rescues a very tiny Italian Professor from the waves. Together they form an alliance to destroy the villain, a corpulent gentleman with a predilection for vanilla bon- bons and roll-your-own cigarettes.\nPERI: I’m not noticing any explanation about the monkey.\nCHARDALOT: I genuinely thought you would be amused by it. I intended you to discover it after lunch. I saw a play once in which such a gift was given, in Berlin. It caused great hilarity.\nPERI: Okay, let’s say, for the sake of argument, that I believe you. What has happened to the Doctor and Miss Bultitude? Where are they?\nCHARDALOT: Somewhere above our heads. Our enemy is very well-connected. This hotel has a suite of secret rooms for Royal use. The manager denies their existence, but they tell a different story around the docks. I think Miss Bultitude lured you to our enemy’s lair, but I don’t believe that the Doctor is in any immediate danger. Our opponent will need him as a hostage. How else is he to escape this hotel? He must have something to bargain with.\nPERI: So let’s find the room and bust him.\nCHARDALOT: The last thing we should do is panic him. The manager has instructed the staff to keep an eye out for any suspicious behaviour. And there’s something else we can do. I have procured the key to Miss Bultitude’s room. We can go there soon for a gentle rummage. But we should proceed as slowly and gently as we are able.\nPERI: But what about the local police? Couldn't they help?\nCHARDALOT: Hardly. The trickiest affair they deal with is the odd stolen watch, the occasional body pitched into the waves after a bad night at the tables. They’re well-meaning but hopelessly unsuited to a case like ours.\nPERI: Even so, wouldn’t a little manpower be useful?\nCHARDALOT: I have wired Brussels. A team of my most reliable men will be with us within the hour. I'll make this building escape-proof, don’t you worry, Miss Brown.\nPERI: But I do worry, Inspector. I worry that we’re sitting here drinking coffee while the Doctor is bound and gagged in a cupboard somewhere.\nCHARDALOT: Our opponent does have some principles.\nWAITER: Monsieur Chardalot.\nCHARDALOT: Oh dear. Mister Proust has sent his cakes back to us. Madeleine, Miss Brown?\nPERI: No thanks.\nCHARDALOT: They look rather good. You should eat something.\nPERI: No thanks. You go ahead.\nCHARDALOT: You know, with your help, and the Doctor’s help, I think I may finally bring our enemy to justice.\nPERI: So who is he then, this guy? What's his game plan?\nCHARDALOT: He and I have a special connection, a particular sympathy. In some ways he is a gentleman, in others an animal. But I know his ways. I know how to hunt him, trust me. Now, perhaps we should begin with a light reconnaissance mission in Miss Bultitude’s bedroom.\nPERI: Is that really necessary?\nCHARDALOT: I believe so. But you ought to accompany me, if only so that my search is conducted in the presence of a witness.\nPERI: Okay, I will. But only to see that you’re not up to anything dishonest.\nCHARDALOT: Well, if her favourite nightie goes missing, we'll all know who to blame.\nALICE: Oh, what a marvellous telescope. The people down there all look like ants.\nDOCTOR: You’re pointing it at the balustrade, Miss Bultitude. They are ants.\nTOBY: Probably after my cake crumbs, the swine.\nALICE: Oh, I can see Miss Brown and that tedious old policeman. They look very friendly. They’re eating buns.\nTOBY: Do you think they know each other? Might they be working together?\nDOCTOR: Miss Brown works with me.\nALICE: On what, exactly?\nDOCTOR: We just like making life difficult for certain sorts of people.\nTOBY: What sorts of people?\nDOCTOR: Oh, tyrants, bullies, ne’er-do-wells, the odd anthropomorphic slug.\nTOBY: Are you also a police detective, Doctor?\nALICE: I don’t think the Doctor would make a very good detective, not with those spats.\nDOCTOR: Would you be worried if I were a detective, Toby? Are you in trouble of some kind?\nTOBY: Trouble?\nDOCTOR: I think you’re a long way from home, aren’t you.\nTOBY: Of course I am, Doctor. We’re in Belgium. I was born in England.\nDOCTOR: Were you? Really?\nTOBY: I’m as British as you are, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Very probably.\nALICE: Ah, but there are mysteries about your background, Toby. You must concede that.\nTOBY: Are there any of those peppermints left, or did I eat them all?\nALICE: Toby. Go on, admit it. There’s got to be more to it than the nonsense in your memoirs.\nTOBY: Every word of it is true.\nALICE: Even the bit about maternal impression and the stampeding herd of boar in the Ardennes?\nTOBY: Well...\nALICE: Come on, where did you grow up?\nTOBY: In England, mainly. My mother was a fine 700lbs Fancy Devonshire. She had the most elegant lop ears, and was devoted to me. My father was a portly Essex Half-Black, with a permanent expression of quiet optimism, and a pipe he never put down.\nALICE: Was it a happy childhood?\nTOBY: I think so. I remember the day I left home. My mother wept so much, pressed a peppermint into my hand. My father pretended not to cry, and tapped his briar on the sole of his shoe, let the spent tobacco fall on the crazy paving. When I think of them, I can smell the scent of the dog roses growing round the door, hear the bees buzzing from flower to flower.\nDOCTOR: And what else do you recall?\nTOBY: Well, I don’t know. I think that’s what I remember mainly. Dog roses round the door, spent tobacco on the crazy paving.\nDOCTOR: And where was your parent’s home?\nTOBY: In England.\nALICE: Whereabouts?\nTOBY: In England.\nALICE: I see.\nDOCTOR: Does that satisfy you, Miss Bultitude? Wouldn’t make much of a first chapter, would it?\nALICE: Don’t be so rude, Doctor.\nTOBY: I can tell you more about my first manager, Mister Norman. How he smoked cigars, only the cheap ones, mind, but it looked good front of cloth, impressed them.\nDOCTOR: Were his terms good?\nTOBY: We were on a fifty-fifty split. Lily Langtry never got that. And I had the entire proceeds of the shilling pamphlets.\nDOCTOR: Sounds more than fair.\nTOBY: You know, there are people around today who say we were all being cruelly abused by our managers. What rubbish. What would they know of cruelty? (telephone rings) Would you excuse me for a moment?\nDOCTOR: We will amuse ourselves on the balcony. There’s something out there I want to check anyway. Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: Hmm? Oh, of course.\nTOBY: (answers phone) Ahoy.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: It’s me.\nTOBY: Any progress?\nALBERTINE: [OC]: Quite a bit. You’re right, they’re not who we thought they were. She doesn’t know anything about us.\nTOBY: Battenburg’s just the same.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: Odd thing is, they seem to be in the business, or at least I think they are. She was rather vague on that point. They can’t have been doing it for long. I even dropped your name and it meant nothing to her.\nTOBY: She might be pretending.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: Possibly, but I think she’s harmless. What about the old girl?\nTOBY: What about her?\nALBERTINE: [OC]: She hasn’t come to kill you, then.\nTOBY: Not a bit of it. She just wants to interview me for a book, that’s all.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: So you don’t need me to rush back and rescue you, then.\nTOBY: Certainly not. She makes far better tea than you.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: Oh!\nPERI: I’m not convinced rummaging through an old lady’s room is very well-mannered, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: So you said, repeatedly. However, let’s see what we can find, apart from moth balls and lily of the valley.\nPERI: Here’s a scrapbook. Stage acts. Julia Pastrana, the Baboon Lady, will dance the Highland Fling. Gentlemen are entitled to a cigar gratis.\nCHARDALOT: Jo-Jo the Dog-faced Boy, Equus the Calculating Horse, Madame Baboo the Lobster-claw Lady. Instead of hands and feet she has the real claws of a lobster. Charming picture of her doing a crochet square.\nPERI: Simia, the Missing Link.\nCHARDALOT: She’s new to me.\nPERI: Toby the Sapient Pig.\nCHARDALOT: There are more cuttings on him than any of the others. Photographs nicely, doesn’t he?\nPERI: He looks kind of familiar.\nCHARDALOT: It’s odd. Most of these pigs were ladies, you know. Well, most of them were bears shaved strategically and then strapped into a chair. The crinolines hid the manacles. But this chap’s a chap, and he looks very like the pig in the photograph. Look, he’s signed this one.\nPERI: It is your pulchritude that separates you from the multitude, Miss Bultitude. Be lucky. Toby.\nCHARDALOT: Miss Bultitude was having some trouble paying her bill. Look at that. Perhaps she’s just flitted away.\nPERI: Leaving these behind her? A lady never travels without her pearls.\nCHARDALOT: Not real, but excellent fakes. She could have pawned these to pay the bill.\nPERI: Right, I think we’ve seen enough.\nCHARDALOT: Wait. And it seems she had an appointment to keep. Read this.\nPERI: Miss Bultitude. If you wish to learn something to your advantage, then I would be glad to speak with you in the Turkish Steam Room. Would tea time tomorrow suit you? If so, I shall meet you there at 4 p.m. Come as you are, Toby.\nCHARDALOT: A note written by a pig. How outré. The signature matches the one on the carte de visite. Where’s the Turkish Steam Room?\nPERI: It’s round the back. I don’t think it’s working any more. They’ve just put in a spanking new baths at the front of the hotel.\nCHARDALOT: A perfect place for a discreet meeting between an old lady and a well-dressed pig, I would have thought.\nPERI: Maybe.\nCHARDALOT: How should a pig dress in a hammam?\nPERI: I don’t think we'll find out today, Inspector, but if I wanted to entice Miss Bultitude into danger, I think I’d send her a note purporting to be from one of her heroes.\nCHARDALOT: I see what you mean. I wonder. Perhaps we should keep this appointment for her.\nPERI: See who turns up, you mean?\nCHARDALOT: Why not? It might lead us a little further into the heart of this mystery.\nPERI: Did you hear that?\nCHARDALOT: Nurse Albertine! How charming to see you again. A shoe or a button undone, by\nALBERTINE: Sorry, sir. I er\nPERI: Don’t give it another thought. Do it myself all the time.\nALBERTINE: I wanted to ask whether Miss Brown would like me to take her for a walk on the promenade. Just to make a final assessment about the state of her health. If you concur?\nCHARDALOT: Of course I concur. You don’t need to ask my permission.\nPERI: A very good idea. I'll be right with you.\nPERI: If you have an explanation for that, Inspector, I’d be very glad to hear it.\nTOBY: Oh, I’ve dropped my chocolate éclair.\nDOCTOR: How very extraordinary. The beach is covered in raw steak. Some of it’s still moving.\nTOBY: Steak?\nDOCTOR: Cows. The heavens opened and down they came.\nALICE: How ghastly. I’ve read about this with fish and frogs.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps a whirlwind lifted them from an abattoir and delivered it here. The sunbathers aren’t very happy.\nTOBY: Do you think any of the meat can be saved?\nALICE: Who knows what its provenance may be? Oh, it’s quite disgusting. I don’t know if I can look anymore. Oh, he'll never get that bathing suit clean.\nDOCTOR: You know, I was once on a beach not so far away from here. Oh, a long time ago, feels like three hundred years at least. Awhale was beached on the shore at Kattvik. Lay there for four days until its bowels exploded.\nALICE: How frightful.\nDOCTOR: Killed a few spectators. Not from the explosion, from some disease they caught after being splattered with rotten whale.\nTOBY: Ah, lunch. If you’d be so kind, Miss Bultitude.\nALICE: Oh, yes.\nTOBY: Omelette, made with gull’s eggs. Marvellous.\nALICE: I’m surprised you haven't lost your appetite. Not after what’s just happened on the beach.\nTOBY: I’ve always kept hold of it in the past. Anyway, I’m not going down to the beach. Haven't done anything like that since the farewell concert.\nDOCTOR: Why's that?\nTOBY: I hate taking off my shirt in public places. People stare. And I feel safe here. This suite, you know, was built for a cousin of the King of the Belgians. Suffered from neurasthenia, and worse. It kept him away from the world, and the world away from him. Most of the staff don’t even know that these rooms exist.\nDOCTOR: And yet you discovered them, Miss Bultitude.\nALICE: He needs his bed turning down each night, doesn’t he? I kept an eye on the designated chamber maid.\nTOBY: The manager will have to change the rota.\nPERI: We picked our moment for a walk, didn’t we?\nALBERTINE: What happened? Did it wash in from the sea?\nPERI: I suppose a cattle ship must have run aground. I don’t think I’ll be doing any swimming today.\nALBERTINE: Shall we walk towards the town? I’ve no wish to slip in a puddle of vitreous humour. It would remind me of my student days.\nPERI: You studied ophthalmology?\nALBERTINE: Surgery. Battlefield surgery. The woman who taught me was taught by Mary Seacole. She took me on as a student. We saw some action against the Boers. It was all going well until the money ran out.\nPERI: Yeah, well, you’re not the only one who never finished her course.\nALBERTINE: What was yours?\nPERI: Botany.\nALBERTINE: What happened?\nPERI: You might have seen him around the hotel yesterday. A guy in yellow pants?\nALBERTINE: (laughs) We’ve done too much running around after other people, haven’t we, you and I. Putting up with their moods, getting them out of trouble. Some days it seems quite exciting. I remember when Toby and I were staying in Budapest. He ate everything on the menu at the Hotel Margitsziget, and the other diners mutinied. Then three was the night in Marseilles when he downed sixteen gallons of bouillabaisse. But other days you sit there thinking, I could have had qualifications. I could have had a position, respect, like Mother Seacole did. They gave her medals and a dinner at the Royal Surrey Gardens, Duke of Wellington at her side, a thousand voices singing the Hallelujah Chorus, and her a lady of colour. And me, I’m on the run. And there’s someone skulking around this place who wants... well, who wishes us great harm.\nPERI: You're in trouble?\nALBERTINE: Oh dear, I’ve probably said too much. Do you fancy an ice cream? Solidago’s stand is just here.\nPERI: Oh, no.\nALBERTINE: That blue box has been moved, I see.\nPERI: Oh God. Look, this is more serious than the Doctor going AWOL. That box... Look, Albertine, can I trust you?\nALBERTINE: Of course.\nPERI: I don’t Know who attacked me last night, I don’t know what’s happened to the Doctor and Miss Bultitude, but I think the Inspector has something to do with it. Will you help me search the hotel? I’ve got to find them, otherwise I’m going to be stuck here forever. That box, it’s how we get around. It’s, well, it’s a time machine.\nALBERTINE: I think you’d better keep silent for the moment, Miss Brown.\nPERI: But I\nCHARDALOT: Miss Brown! Miss Brown! It’s nearly four o’clock. We have an appointment to keep.\nDOCTOR: So, tell me, Toby, just why do you feel obliged to live in seclusion? Oh, I know that the prodigy business isn’t what it was, but there’s no need to live in secrecy just because you’ve gone out of fashion. Look at Chang Wu Gao. His tea shop did a roaring trade in Bournemouth. Everyone came to his oriental bazaars. Why bother to hide yourself away?\nALICE: Yes, do tell.\nTOBY: Oh, you’re very good, you two, but I won’t spill all my secrets in an afternoon. I don’t wish to patronise you, but the pair of you have stumbled on something in these rooms which you would find impossible to understand or appreciate.\nALICE: Well, you’ve acted against your own wishes. You have patronised us. I’m not a fool, you know, Toby. I’ve seen something of the world.\nDOCTOR: Try us, Toby.\nTOBY: Very well. Firstly, the human race as you know it is a terrible aberration. It should never have been brought into being. Secondly, a man is coming from the future in order to kill me. Thirdly, I intend to force this assassin to help me undo the damage that has been done to history, and return the world to its natural state. All I need is access to his time machine.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nALICE: That wasn’t the answer I was expecting.\nTOBY: If you could only see your faces.\nALICE: Do you have any Vichy water? I feel a little strange.\nTOBY: There’s some on the balcony table. Doctor, would you oblige?\nDOCTOR: My pleasure.\nTOBY: Miss Bultitude, did you ever read that English novel about the man who travels into the future and meets all those little blond fairies and the hairy people who live under the ground?\nALICE: Yes.\nTOBY: Load of old rubbish, wasn't it? What’s the Doctor doing out there?\nALICE: Oh dear.\nTOBY: What’s happened?\nALICE: I’m afraid he’s jumped off the balcony.\nALBERTINE: Sir, sir, excuse me.\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nALBERTINE: Are you the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Er, yes. How did you know?\nALBERTINE: I saw you through a telescope once. And there was something about the way you just crashed through that awning. I’m told it’s the kind of thing that you do.\nDOCTOR: I take it you’ve met Peri.\nALBERTINE: That’s right. Now, let me examine you. Don’t worry, I’m a professional.\nDOCTOR: Nothing broken. I’ll just have a big bruise on my shin in the morning.\nALBERTINE: Oh, not a bad diagnosis.\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t be Toby’s nurse, would you?\nALBERTINE: Call me Albertine.\nDOCTOR: And you don’t recognise me because you fired some kind of ray gun at me last night.\nALBERTINE: I don’t know what you're talking about.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Good employer is he, Toby?\nALBERTINE: Good enough.\nDOCTOR: Despite the delusions, you mean, and the ranting, and that awful toupee.\nALBERTINE: He’s not as bad as he seems.\nDOCTOR: Good. So, where’s Peri?\nALBERTINE: She’s with Inspector Chardalot.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s not good news. I don’t trust that man any further than I could carry him with my teeth.\nALBERTINE: No. I think he’s dangerous.\nDOCTOR: Why do you say that?\nALBERTINE: My patient lives in fear of an enemy who wishes him dead. For a moment we thought you were this man, but I don’t see how you can be. I think the Inspector is the next most likely suspect.\nDOCTOR: Then that’s another reason to find him.\nALBERTINE: He and Miss Brown went to the Turkish Steam Room together. The old one, round the back.\nDOCTOR: What?\nALBERTINE: The steam room?\nDOCTOR: Which means they’re alone together. And naked, presumably.\nPERI: Inspector, might I ask you something? Is there anything, well, porcine about the man you're hunting?\nCHARDALOT: (laughs) Porcine! If you only have trotters it’s rather difficult to refill a revolver barrel.\nPERI: So you're not on the trail of Toby the Sapient Pig. He’s not your enemy.\nCHARDALOT: I think the pig is a red herring. Here we are. Our mystery man will be here in ten minutes, if he keeps his appointment.\nPERI: Maybe we should wait inside. If he sees us loitering out here he might not bother.\nCHARDALOT: A very sensible suggestion. (door opens) After you, Miss Brown.\nPERI: [OC]: I should have seen that coming, shouldn't I?\nCHARDALOT: So sorry, Miss Brown, but I don’t want any company on this pig hunt of mine.\nPERI: [OC]: What do you want, then? What's it all about?\nCHARDALOT: I don’t want anything, Miss Brown, apart from you and the Doctor out of my way. Oh, and the use of your time machine. So all you have to do is relax and enjoy your steam bath. This facility may not be open to guests, but it’s still connected up to the main pipes that service the new wing.\nPERI: [OC]: Chardalot!\nCHARDALOT: How hot do you like it, Peri? This hot? Or this hot? I may call you Peri, may I not?\nPERI: [OC]: Open this door, Chardalot! No! No! Turn it off!\nCHARDALOT: Have you ever wondered how ham feels just before the gong goes for Sunday lunch?\nPERI: [OC]: Please, open the door!"

And just before tea time, too.\nALICE: We can still have our fun.\nTOBY: I suppose.\nALICE: Are you nearly ready?\nTOBY: Ready. Draw the curtains, would you?\nALICE: All set.\nTOBY: One very important element, Miss Bultitude. That heart-shaped box on top of the ottoman. Open it up.\nALICE: It looks splendid. Praline?\nTOBY: Caramel.\nALICE: Oh, capital. I do love the flickers.\nTOBY: Let’s start the show.\nALICE: That’s Vienna, surely?\nTOBY: Mmm, Vienna. Vienna in the summer of 1903. The capital of porcine culture. Freud worked here during this period, you know, in his consulting rooms on the Berggasse. All the finest minds in the world were there. Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Strindberg. They were all pigs, you see.\nALICE: Oh.\nTOBY: Strindberg went in search of the Philosopher’s Stone, did you know that?\nALICE: Did he find it?\nTOBY: No.\nALICE: Pity. It might have made him nicer to his wife.\nTOBY: Look, here’s Sir Henry Irving performing Hamlet’s famous soliloquy. Oh that the Everlasting should set its canon ‘gainst self-slaughter. To die, to eat, to eat, perchance to lunch.\nALICE: Oh, I don’t think that’s right.\nTOBY: I forget the exact words. Ah, here’s Colonel Dreyfus. A scandal, you know, and a warning from history.\nALICE: You know, Toby, I have something to confess to you. Have you ever been to Madame Ensor’s curiosity shop?\nTOBY: No.\nALICE: Well, I don’t blame you, frankly. It’s packed to the rafters with the most grotesque tat. Taxidermy. And she keeps a monkey that’s always relieving itself in to the Nautilus shells.\nTOBY: Why are you telling me this?\nALICE: I have a weakness for taxidermy. It all started on my fifth birthday when my step-father bought me my first python attacking a mongoose.\nTOBY: Why did he do a thing like that?\nALICE: To frighten me, I think. He was that sort of man, I’m sorry to say. But it had the opposite effect. If you were to stand in the parlour in my cottage, you would see rows of orange glass eyes staring back at you. Well, when I arrived in Ostend, I visited Madame Ensor’s shop, and who was sitting in the window?\nTOBY: I don’t know.\nALICE: You were.\nTOBY: I was?\nALICE: Well, it wasn’t really you, just some unfortunate collection of offcuts stuffed with sawdust and dressed in a cast-off evening suit not nearly as nice as yours. But I’m afraid I bought it and had it shipped back to England. It’s rather embarrassing now I’ve made friends with you.\nTOBY: What... what did it look like?\nALICE: He was sitting in an armchair, smoking a cheroot. They’d made you wear a fez. You’ve never worn a fez in your life, have you?\nTOBY: You are correct. How... how much did you pay for me?\nALICE: Three guineas.\nTOBY: Three guineas. (film stops) Three guineas? Is that all? Is that all, three guineas?\nALICE: I haggled.\nTOBY: Haggled.\nALICE: Shall I?\nTOBY: Do.\nALICE: Good afternoon.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: May I speak to my employer, please?\nALICE: Oh, yes. I’ll put him on. Nurse Albertine.\nTOBY: Albertine?\nALBERTINE: [OC]: Toby, we’ve got to leave right now.\nTOBY: Now? But it’s only a couple of hours until dinner.\nALBERTINE: [OC]: That doesn’t matter. We can pack a hamper. We can pack two hampers. But we can’t stay here tonight, it’s not safe.\nTOBY: What's happened?\nALBERTINE: [OC]: I think Chardalot’s killed the Doctor’s wife. He’s... you keep away from me!\nTOBY: Nurse Albertine? Albertine?\nALBERTINE: Don't you have a Swiss Army knife to cut through telephone cables?\nCHARDALOT: Not with molars like mine. Hmm. Tastes soapy, somehow.\nALBERTINE: I’m not going to tell you anything, you know.\nCHARDALOT: No need to put yourself through that, Nurse Albertine. You’ve saved me a great deal of trouble. I had thought I would be obliged to torture a confession from you, put you in the steam room with the body of Miss Brown to sharpen your powers of concentration, but all I’ve done is to stand behind the curtain and watch you break into my room, rifle through my bedside table, and dial 139 on that telephone, and I now\nCHARDALOT: know where the object of my quest is to be found.\nALBERTINE: Come any closer, and I'll stick you. A Boer soldier attempted to commit an outrage on me ina field hospital in the Transvaal. He failed, and so will you.\nCHARDALOT: I don’t think there’s a piece of hotel cutlery on the planet capable of doing me in, Nurse Albertine, but come and have a go by all means.\nALBERTINE: What’s the matter with you? Why won't you...\nCHARDALOT: Fall over? Thrash about on the carpet? Gurgle up a bit of blood for you?\nALBERTINE: That’s what I was hoping for, yes.\nCHARDALOT: Sorry to disappoint you, but I don’t really feel physical pain. I understand that we gave up that little habit some time ago.\nALBERTINE: Get off me!\nCHARDALOT: Hold still! How do you expect me to tie you up when you're struggling so. There. I’d venture that the trunk murderess herself couldn’t have done a better job. Now, why don’t you sit this round out in the bathroom, eh? Come along.\nALBERTINE: They'll come looking for me, you know.\nCHARDALOT: Who, Peri? Your precious patient? I don’t think so.\nALBERTINE: Or the Doctor.\nCHARDALOT: Do me a favour.\nALBERTINE: We'll see.\nCHARDALOT: Now, let me just show you the view from the window.\nALBERTINE: (gasps) Wouldn't a police department cover your expenses on this case, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: It’s not so bad a view, for a moderately priced room.\nALBERTINE: Not if you like dustbins.\nCHARDALOT: Well, that’s why I wanted to show it to you, really, just in case you were thinking of climbing down to the kitchen courtyard. Take a good look. There aren’t enough potato peelings to break your fall, I’m afraid. So sit tight, eh?\nALBERTINE: Well, I won’t go hungry. There’s enough food in this bathroom to satisfy a small\nCHARDALOT: You may have some of the preserved fruit, if you wish.\nALBERTINE: Thank you.\nCHARDALOT: But touch my chocolate biscuits and I'll fillet you.\nALBERTINE: I'll remember that.\nCHARDALOT: On second thoughts, why don’t I just gag you.\nDOCTOR: Peri! Peri, are you in there?\nPERI: [OC]: (gasping) Doctor, let me out of here. I think I can feel my lungs beginning to scorch.\nDOCTOR: The door won't budge.\nPERI: [OC]: There should be a wheel that controls the temperature, to the left of the main pipe.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it won’t turn! It’s stuck fast. I’m going to have to do something inelegant with a fire extinguisher.\nPERI: [OC]: Just do it quickly!\nDOCTOR: Here. Oh, goodness.\nPERI: Now, can you do one more thing for me?\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nPERI: That fire extinguisher, turn of the century model, yes?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nPERI: Still working?\nDOCTOR: I think so.\nPERI: Then let me have it!\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nPERI: Ah! Ah! Oh. Much obliged.\nDOCTOR: How are you feeling?\nPERI: Like my skin might be about to start peeling off in handfuls.\nDOCTOR: Good. Right. Now for the Inspector.\nALICE: I didn’t mean any harm by it. I only wanted a souvenir.\nTOBY: Don’t think that will excuse you. Collecting postcards is one thing. Even china figurines I'd be prepared to overlook. But taxidermy? It makes me feel dirty, Miss Bultitude. Dirty!\nALICE: It’s a foible, just a foible. It's my step-father’s fault. I'll never buy another one. Please say you forgive me.\nTOBY: I’m thinking about it. But I have other things on my mind too, you know. What has happened to Nurse\nTOBY: Albertine? She’s a resourceful woman, I know. She saw things under canvas in the South African war that would have turned the stomach of a pork butcher. But all the same. She was attacked, Miss Bultitude. Attacked!\nALICE: And she told you to leave immediately, so let’s follow her advice. Now, are these important?\nTOBY: Yes. No. Oh, I don’t know. You see how lost I am without her.\nALICE: Well, listen, what if I pack this portmanteau with all the most important things, and put the don’t knows in the small trunk. That would start us off, wouldn’t it? And then when Nurse Albertine returns, she can tell us where we went wrong. Now, what about these? They’re rather interesting. Glass of some sort? Crystal?\nTOBY: Hextacophulite tefulon. Says that on the instruction book, anyway. Part of a communication system. You move the rods about until you find a signal. Not that there’s anything to listen to in this lost archipelago of space-time. Think I'll have to wait at least another century before I get a decent tune out of that thing.\nALICE: Let’s put it in with the don’t knows then. (glass breaks) Oh dear.\nTOBY: It’s of no consequence. I’ve never owned a licence for it.\nALICE: All the same, I’m so sorry. What about this?\nTOBY: My mother knitted that.\nALICE: Would it fit you now, though?\nTOBY: Didn't fit me then. My mother’s knitting was abominable. In the portmanteau, if you please.\nALICE: Of course.\nTOBY: What's that?\nALICE: What's what?\nTOBY: A sound, in the corridor. And a smell.\nALICE: Inspector!\nTOBY: You! How dare you. Haven’t you done enough to torment me yet, you sadist? Come to cut me up, have you? Where’s your box of knives, you filthy sawbones, eh?\nCHARDALOT: Come on, Toby. That’s no way to talk to your old Dad.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: (Clouseau accent) ‘Ello? Room service for you, Inspector? ‘Ello? (door opens, speaks normally) Oh.\nPERI: Nobody home.\nDOCTOR: Which makes it all the easier for us to have a snoop around.\nPERI: Hmm. He’s been eating pickles.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Fancy one?\nPERI: Not really.\nDOCTOR: Please yourself. Mmm.\nPERI: Doctor, his case is on top of the wardrobe.\nDOCTOR: Oh, locked.\nPERI: Give me that pickle fork.\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nPERI: Ah ha.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’ve never seen that done before. Oh.\nPERI: Do you think those are his? I wouldn’t have thought he was the type.\nDOCTOR: There’s no law against it. What’s he been reading?\nPERI: His own diary. A phrase book. French to Walloon. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The Woman in White. Mad or Married. A Manx story. ALa Recherche du Temps Perdu.\nDOCTOR: I might have predicted that.\nPERI: The Criminal Annals of France and the Low Countries, volume six.\nDOCTOR: What’s the bookmark on?\nPERI: What do you know, Marie Lefevre, the trunk murderess of Saint Germain. Whoever he is, he’s been doing his homework.\nDOCTOR: Peri, is that bookmark bleeping?\nPERI: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Put it down slowly.\nPERI: Yes.\nDOCTOR: That's the way.\nPERI: Is it...\nDOCTOR: A bomb?\nPERI: Yes.\nDOCTOR: No. Something much more unusual than that. This is a device for detecting the presence of time machines.\nPERI: Who’s there? (door opens) Albertine?\nALBERTINE: Oh! You're all wet.\nPERI: You're all tied up.\nALBERTINE: The Inspector. And he’s on his way to my patient. Get this off my wrists!\nDOCTOR: Oh, would this knife help? I found it on the Inspector’s breakfast plate. Although looking at his bath, I wonder why he bothered to order breakfast. Sultanas, raisins, sugared almonds, chocolate biscuits, mint lumps.\nPERI: I knew a girl at college who did this sort of thing. They sent her to a counsellor.\nDOCTOR: He’s got Tunnock’s Teacakes. I had no idea they were going in 1913.\nPERI: Okay. Albertine, that’s you done.\nALBERTINE: Oh, thank you.\nDOCTOR: Right then, lead us to your patient. And bring that diary, would you, Peri? I’ve a feeling we’re going to need it.\nCHARDALOT: What about this one? The Secret Agent. I’ve read this. Boy gets blown up in Greenwich Park, offal all over the rose garden, and there’s the bit where the wife whips the carving knife from the joint on the table and sticks it into her husband. Quite a story.\nTOBY: Naturally. It was written by a pig.\nCHARDALOT: Had a lot of this, have you, Miss Bultitude? Embarrassing, isn’t it? Shakespeare was a pig, Milton was a pig, Ibsen was a pig, Little Titch was a pig. What was George Eliot?\nTOBY: A pig, obviously.\nCHARDALOT: Well, she was no beauty, I grant you.\nALICE: If there is some disagreement between you gentlemen, I’m sure we could resolve it without recourse to abuse.\nCHARDALOT: No time for that, Miss Bultitude. We have to pack. Now, The Secret Agent. Portmanteau or don’t know pile?\nTOBY: Don’t know. Portmanteau. Mmm, dunno.\nCHARDALOT: You've got to feel sorry for the boy, haven’t you?\nTOBY: What have you done with Nurse Albertine?\nCHARDALOT: You'll discover soon enough. Now I suggest that you pack yourself an overnight bag. Very well, I suppose now’s the moment for making gruesome asseverations about Miss Bultitude. Toby, how would you prefer to see her die?\nTOBY: Portmanteau.\nCHARDALOT: Eh?\nTOBY: Put the book in the portmanteau. If we’re going on a journey, we’ll need something to read. I like Conrad. He has a sharp sense of the ugliness of human nature.\nCHARDALOT: Excellent.\nTOBY: Listen, I'll make a bargain with you. Help me reverse these aberrations, and I'll give you anything that you want. Name it. You and I both know that the world shouldn't be like this.\nCHARDALOT: Oh really, Toby, it’s a fantasy of yours, this idea. A pitiable fantasy. Just wishful thinking and sloppy deduction. The dream of a patient under the gas on the operating table. There was never a world of pigs!\nTOBY: I have all the evidence I need. On 9.5mm.\nCHARDALOT: Oh, that old thing.\nTOBY: The film is important. It’s exhibit A.\nCHARDALOT: You're right about that, but that film doesn’t show the lost empires of the piglets, you know. It’s evidence of something much more terrible than that. If you knew what those images represented, Toby, if you knew, you would go down on your knees and beg me to hang you on a hook and get it over with.\nTOBY: Don’t answer it, Miss Bultitude.\nCHARDALOT: I would if I were you. It’s probably our cab.\nPERI: So, whose life are we saving exactly?\nDOCTOR: Pink gentleman with an upturned nose. Maybe you should ask Nurse Albertine.\nPERI: Is your patient a pig, Albertine?\nALBERTINE: Perhaps. I’ve always been too polite to ask. Why won't this lift go any faster?\nPERI: The performing pig that Miss Bultitude sent fan letters to?\nALBERTINE: She wrote to him, yes.\nPERI: And he wrote back?\nALBERTINE: No. My patient has been living as a recluse. She must have been following us from hotel to hotel.\nDOCTOR: And she wasn't the only one, eh? The Inspector has been tailing him too.\nALBERTINE: All I know is that Toby knew he was going to be assassinated, you see, but he thought you were going to do it.\nDOCTOR: Me?\nALBERTINE: He knew there was a doctor who meant him harm and assumed it was you. But Chardalot must be a doctor as well.\nDOCTOR: Well, if that’s true, I think he’s about to betray his Hippocratic Oath.\nPERI: Is your employer a time traveller, Albertine? Is he an alien?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think he knows himself.\nALBERTINE: He'll explain everything when you meet him. There’s much you wouldn’t believe even if I told you.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you'll find me too hard to convince. I already know about the time machine.\nALBERTINE: I don’t know what you're talking about.\nPERI: Your assassin is hunting for someone with a time machine. And we’ve got one, remember?\nALBERTINE: Then perhaps he wants to kill you too.\nCHARDALOT: It looks lovely in the late afternoon light, doesn’t it? What a pity we all had to check out so abruptly.\nALICE: We'll be back, won’t we, Toby.\nTOBY: I feel sick.\nALICE: (sotto) I have some travel sweets, if you’re desperate.\nTOBY: Thank you.\nCHARDALOT: Watch out, Miss Bultitude. He’ll have the lot.\nALICE: He’s welcome to the lot.\nCHARDALOT: She’s an indulgent one, isn’t she, boy? You always liked your food.\nTOBY: You, sir, are no father of mine.\nCHARDALOT: Do you not remember me at all, Toby? Do you not recall how I taught you to smoke, how I taught you to hold a coffee cup? Don’t you remember the hours we spent walking around the laboratory with a little volume of Diderot balanced on your head? Is your memory so short?\nTOBY: My father was from Essex. He was a half-black with lop ears. He wore polished tweed and smoked dark shag.\nCHARDALOT: You were made in a basement in Vienna, Toby. I grew you in a bell jar, and when you were done I took you out and worked on you until you were fit to take tea with gentlemen.\nALICE: Inspector! These remarks are in very bad taste.\nCHARDALOT: I’m sorry to offend you, Miss Bultitude, but these are the plain facts. I was there at Toby’s birth, and I can assure you that his ancestry does not lie in Essex. He is the product of an experiment to improve the cognitive and intellectual abilities of the pig, to raise the humble animal to the level of what you would call the human being. The experiment was conducted in Vienna some years ago, for legal and operational reasons, and once I arrived there I found I was unable to return. And then he escaped from the house, found his way to England in a cattle truck, I believe?\nTOBY: Nonsense.\nCHARDALOT: But now we are reunited, and I have the means to take him home. Are you ready to go home, Toby?\nTOBY: Home?\nCHARDALOT: Gamantis. What does that word mean to you? Is it there at the back of your mind?\nTOBY: It does seem familiar, yes.\nCHARDALOT: Good. That’s progress. Given time, you might even start to remember some of the real details of your childhood.\nTOBY: I remember my childhood perfectly well, thank you. My father tapping his briar and letting the tobacco spill onto the crazy paving, my mother waving her handkerchief as she bade me goodbye.\nCHARDALOT: Oh, Toby. What tobacco? What crazy paving?\nTOBY: I shan’t give in to your bullying, you know.\nCHARDALOT: It scarcely matters. Soon the identity of your old Ma and Pa will be an entirely academic matter. I’m afraid my peer review panel will probably want to dissect you.\nTOBY: Die-sect? It’s dee-sect, you ignoramus. It doesn’t mean to slice something in two. Do you know nothing of etymology?\nCHARDALOT: I suppose you'd like me to say bee-ography, too. I think only the Duke of Anglesey still pronounces it that way.\nTOBY: I have standards, that’s all.\nALBERTINE: I knew we’d be too late.\nDOCTOR: Well, there may be something here that will tell us where to look next.\nALBERTINE: He’s left his telescope. We can find him with this.\nPERI: Albertine, if you point it that way, all you’re going to see is the wallpaper.\nALBERTINE: Not if I can remember which buttons to press.\nDOCTOR: What?\nALBERTINE: Then we can look through the town as if it were made of glass. Ah.\nDOCTOR: Ingenious. Can you see them?\nALBERTINE: No. Yes! They’re pulling up at the railway station in a motor taxi. They must be catching the Brussels train. There’s a direct service that leaves at ten past the hour.\nPERI: Great. How are we going to catch up with them now?\nALBERTINE: Easy. Just let me find my driving goggles.\nGUARD: Bruxelles, Bruxelles.\nCHARDALOT: Now, what can we do to amuse ourselves? We can’t look through the window at the rolling scenery, can we. It’s Belgium. Perhaps you’d like a little lecture on family history, Toby?\nTOBY: I’d appreciate it more, Inspector, if you were to order something from the buffet car. If you know my physiognomy as well as you claim, then you'll understand the importance of my request.\nCHARDALOT: And give you and Miss Bultitude an opportunity to raise the alarm? I don’t think so.\nALICE: Have some more travel sweets, Toby. Help yourself.\nTOBY: Thank you.\nALICE: There’s still hope for us, while the Doctor and Miss Brown and Nurse Albertine are alive.\nCHARDALOT: Yes, well, there’s a fairly good chance they no longer enjoy that happy state. Miss Brown, I suspect, is dripping from the walls of the steam room, and the Doctor and Nurse Albertine I imagine will fall foul of a little trail of additional traps.\nTOBY: What sort of traps?\nCHARDALOT: Nothing too elaborate. I’ve given their descriptions to the local gendarme. If they go to the train station they'll be picked up by the police. That’s the boring one. There’s also a fun-sized gas volatiser balanced on the architrave of Nurse Albertine’s door, a few razor blades slipped into the apples in the Doctor’s fruit bowl, and a time bomb clamped to the petrol tank of your motor car, Toby, just in case they try to pursue us that way. It’s primed to explode once the engine has reached a predetermined temperature.\nALICE: Not that I know much about this sort of thing, but surely a time bomb should be primed to explode after a certain amount of time has elapsed.\nCHARDALOT: No, my dear Miss Bultitude. You misunderstand the term. When it detonates, the impact of the explosion will be felt across Time as well as space. Whoever is in that car will be blown into the middle of next week. Or last week.\nDOCTOR: It should be this next turning.\nALBERTINE: Right-ho, Doctor. How are we doing for time?\nDOCTOR: Well, if you keep it up at this rate, we ought to be able to overtake them at the next crossing.\nALBERTINE: But how are we going to stop the train?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Ever read The Railway Children?\nPERI: I’m not waving my panties in the air for anyone.\nALBERTINE: Anything in the diary, Peri?\nPERI: Nothing nice. Chardalot was carrying out some sort of experiment on the pigs. He was trying to increase their mental capacity. He was trying to improve their manners.\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nPERI: Listen to this. Toby and Charlie making excellent progress. They are now able to tie their own laces, tell the time, and light their pipes. Charlie, however, is noticeably more aggressive than Toby. I had to speak to him at breakfast today after he tried to spear a piece of black pudding from Toby’s mouth.\nDOCTOR: Was he giving them elocution lessons as well?\nPERI: Doesn’t say. And there’s something wrong about the dates. How old is Inspector Chardalot, would you say?\nALBERTINE: Forty, forty five maybe.\nPERI: Yeah, but entries relating to the experiments were written over half a century ago.\nALBERTINE: How can that be so?\nDOCTOR: Accidents happen, you know. I was thinking that when you were looking through that telescope of yours. Did you know that in the middle of the 25\" century the world was flooded with x-ray spectacles?\nPERI: But they’re just a con from the small ads.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. They shouldn't have existed. People said they were preposterous; well, once they'd had a good look at their neighbours trolling about in their underwear. And they were preposterous. They had no place in the universe. They’d been summoned into existence during an industrial accident in a plastics factory, involving a matter synthesiser and an antique back-number of Powerman and Iron Fist. Well, the company boomed for a year, but then business suddenly collapsed.\nALBERTINE: Why? It sounds like a wonderful invention.\nDOCTOR: Nobody knows how, but the factory was completely destroyed by a rampaging horde of sea- monkeys. Something else that shouldn’t have existed but suddenly did.\nALBERTINE: Listen, I’ve had an idea about how to stop the train.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nALBERTINE: Why don’t I crash the car onto the track?\nPERI: What?\nALBERTINE: The road meets the track about half a mile ahead. It’s a good long stretch, so if we’re fast enough then the train should have long enough to slow down before it hits us.\nPERI: And if we’re not fast enough?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think we'll escape with a full complement of limbs. Nurse Albertine, do you think that... Hang on. What’s that on the road?\nPERI: It’s a scrap of material. It’s your coat!\nALBERTINE: Can’t be. I’m using that to keep my knees warm.\nDOCTOR: We haven't passed this way before.\nALBERTINE: And there’s a dirty great pile of beef up ahead there.\nDOCTOR: Just like we saw on the beach. Oh dear. This is very bad.\nALBERTINE: Well, no time to worry about it now, Doctor. Hold on tight. I’m really going to put my foot down.\nPERI: It’s Chardalot’s bookmark, it’s lit up. It’s got a little screen.\nDOCTOR: And that flashing red mark indicates a time machine.\nPERI: It’s in Brussels. Could it be the Tardis?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. First things first. Switch it off. We've got a train to catch, and there it is.\nPERI: If we drive in front of that, it'll smash us to pieces. We don’t have a big enough head start.\nDOCTOR: I think you may be right.\nALBERTINE: That little machine is still twittering away to itself.\nPERI: No, I’ve switched it off. That must be something else.\nALBERTINE: I knew I should have replaced that fan belt.\nDOCTOR: That’s not your fan belt.\nCHARDALOT: There’s a fine for that, you know, and I’m not paying it.\nALICE: We all heard the crash. If I hadn’t pulled the cord, somebody else would have done so. Look, everybody’s leaning out of the window to see what we've hit.\nCHARDALOT: Is that what you’ll say to the guard when he comes to find out what’s stopped the train? Do remember that I have it in my power to end your life.\nALICE: Sir, I was once waylaid by a gang of filthy bandits in the ravines of Dagestan. Have you ever been to Dagestan? A remote and savage stretch of the Caucasus. The bandits I encountered matched the territory. They were vicious, and toothless, and most of them hadn’t seen a sponge and a bar of Lifebuoy since the assassination of Tsar Alexander III. I did not succumb to them. I shall not succumb to you.\nTOBY: I’m hungry.\nALICE: When we get out of this, I shall take you for lunch at Maxim’s.\nTOBY: I’m not sure I can wait that long. Is the buffet car still open, do you think? Might we pop down the corridor and take a peek?\nCHARDALOT: Listen to you.\nTOBY: But it would only take a few moments. I haven’t eaten anything for over an hour now, except that confectionary. They might still be serving lunch. Aren’t you hungry, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: I have learned to control my appetites.\nALICE: Huh. I distinctly saw you eat a bar of chocolate when we were travelling from the hotel to the station.\nCHARDALOT: Oh, nonsense.\nALICE: I saw you. And don’t think I haven’t noticed the raisins you’ve been picking out of your trouser pockets.\nTOBY: You have raisins?\nCHARDALOT: I do not have raisins.\nALICE: Yes, you do. You’ve been hiding them in your handkerchief, and pretending to cough.\nCHARDALOT: I most certainly have not. And the next person to say so gets a shot from Toby’s cattle-prod.\nDOCTOR: Ah! Everyone all right?\nPERI: I think so. I don’t think those cows will ever recover.\nALBERTINE: I’m sorry, Doctor. I should have thrown it the other way. I didn’t think. I just yanked it from under the dashboard, wrapped it in your coat and threw it into the field. Those poor creatures.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t torture yourself too much, Albertine. You’ve saved all our lives.\nALBERTINE: But what happened?\nDOCTOR: A temporal fission grenade.\nALBERTINE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: A booby-trap. Someone just threw sneezing powder into the Space-Time Vortex. Those poor cows were scattered about thirty miles back towards the Channel and four hours back towards this morning. They’re the stuff we saw smeared all over the beach.\nPERI: What's that? Not another one?\nALBERTINE: No, that’s the train. It's coming to a halt. Someone must have pulled the communication cord.\nDOCTOR: Which means that nobody will have to crash this car into anything. Now look, I’m going to jump out and try and get on board before it moves off again. Peri, where’s that bookmark?\nPERI: Here.\nDOCTOR: I think that’s the Tardis. You two, follow those blips and I’ll meet you in Brussels.\nPERI: Wait a minute. How will you know where to find us?\nDOCTOR: Someone down there will be able to tell me the address. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a train to catch.\nTOBY: I’m afraid I’ve eaten all your travel sweets, Miss Bultitude, and I’ve licked the icing sugar from the tin.\nALICE: We'll get something else soon.\nTOBY: What was that?\nCHARDALOT: Just a little after-shock.\nTOBY: There’s a cow on the track. Look, Miss Bultitude, it’s got something in its mouth.\nALICE: One of the Doctor’s lapels. Does this mean that he’s dead?\nDOCTOR: No, Miss Bultitude, just that I’ll be paying another visit to my favourite tailor on Kolpasha.\nTOBY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’ve explained everything to the guard. La vache est a [??] de la voie. Not an expression you'll find in any of your phrase books, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: I pick up languages very easily, Doctor. I’m terribly adaptable.\nDOCTOR: How nice for you. Now, Toby, I’m guessing that you might be feeling a bit hungry?\nTOBY: I am.\nCHARDALOT: The buffet has reopened, then?\nDOCTOR: It never closed. Takes more than a spasm in the fabric of existence to put a French galley chef off his job.\nTOBY: Marvellous!\nDOCTOR: Now, we have poached eggs, a salmon terrine, some nice bread with walnuts in it I think, and a very runny Camembert. I hope you like your Camembert runny, Toby. (eating sounds) I see that you do.\nCHARDALOT: He'll eat anything, Doctor. It doesn’t even touch the sides on the way down.\nDOCTOR: I think some problems are best discussed over supper, don’t you? Now, Inspector, you sit there, Toby over there, Miss Bultitude, would you do the honour of sitting next to me here?\nALICE: Of course, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Now, we need to fold down our little tables. Yes. And there’s lemonade in that bottle, Toby.\nTOBY: Capital.\nDOCTOR: Miss Bultitude, would you pass me that salad? Thank you. There, now. Isn’t this grand?\nTOBY: Oh yes. Grand.\nDOCTOR: You're not eating, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: I am not ruled by simple desires, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: An odd remark, I must say, for a man who keeps his bath tub filled with dried fruit and chocolate biscuits.\nALICE: I knew I was right about those raisins.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s about time some of the people in this train compartment gave some account of themselves. Or as good an account as they’re able.\nCHARDALOT: What do you mean by that?\nDOCTOR: I mean that some people are so ignorant of their origins that it’s better to consult more authoritative sources. Right, let’s give it a go, shall we? Toby.\nTOBY: Well, I told you some of it already, Doctor. First and foremost I am an entertainer. That was my profession, before I retired. I performed before the paying public. But you can read about all that in my memoirs.\nDOCTOR: And what about the part of your story that didn’t make it into the final draft?\nTOBY: Ah. Well, that’s much more complex, and I’m afraid that if I spell it out, I’m going to make myself sound ridiculous.\nDOCTOR: Try me.\nTOBY: You’re an educated man, Doctor. You must know that sometimes Time can go wrong. Truffle around in it too much and you start disturbing things. And that’s what’s happened here. Somebody has muddied history so that you can no longer see who’s supposed to be in charge.\nDOCTOR: I once knew a lizard with very similar views. Someone tried to lock him up in an airing cupboard. It all ended in tears.\nCHARDALOT: Hopeless, isn’t it, Doctor? Toby’s sense of who he is and where he comes from has been deduced from a reel of kinematic film, the record of a pioneering scientific project. He might as well have attempted to suck his biography out of this madeleine.\nDOCTOR: Eat it if you like, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: Perhaps I shall.\nDOCTOR: What do you make of all this, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: Me? Well, I've seen Toby’s film. Wasn’t a patch on Rescued by Rover.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps this will help you decide.\nCHARDALOT: That is a private document. How did you get it? The hotel was supposed to send that on.\nDOCTOR: Your suitcase fell open and, well, there it was. The diary of a Doctor Alphonse Chardalot. Makes interesting reading. Not just because of what’s written in it, but how it’s written. Every few years or so, the handwriting becomes utterly illegible. It’s as if every few years the author forgets how to write, and has to relearn from scratch. This page, for instance, is a perfectly sensible write-up of an experiment. Aim, to teach a pig how to use asparagus tongs.\nALICE: Heavens!\nDOCTOR: The next page, however, is just a lot of scrawl. Look. What do you make of that, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: Ais for apple. B is for ball. C is for swill.\nTOBY: (laughs) Oh dear. Something’s gone wrong there, hasn't it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I thought you weren’t hungry, Inspector, but I see I’m obliged to return to the buffet car and order some more of those little cakes.\nPERI: So, what do you know about Toby's life before you met him?\nALBERTINE: Not a great deal. He always said he was born in Essex. The Garden of England, he calls it. His parents were apple growers.\nPERI: But what were his parents like? Were they pigs?\nALBERTINE: They looked like him, yes. He always says that in Essex that didn’t matter so much.\nPERI: What made him leave home?\nALBERTINE: Why do any of us leave home? He wanted to work, he wanted to make his own way in the world. He went to London, walked there from his parents’ orchard. He was looking for work as a kitchen porter at the Royal East London Hospital, wnen a showman spotted him on the street. That was Tom Norman. Perhaps you’ve heard of him? From a very old and respected circus family. Anyway, this showman was in need of new talent. His old partner had just left for a tour of the Low Countries.\nPERI: What did he have to do?\nALBERTINE: Oh, nothing much. Talk to the audience, tell them something of his life and experiences, sing a little aria or two. He loved it. And he was particularly keen on that little book. I think he and the showman cooked it up together. Who knows whether any of it was true. I certainly never believed the bit about his heroic rescue of a baby from the spire of Chesterfield Cathedral. What would a baby be doing up the top of a cathedral?\nALBERTINE: (Note — the spire of St Mary and All Saints is highly distinctive, but it isn’t on a cathedral, just a parish church.)\nPERI: But he believed all this, right?\nALBERTINE: Well, yes, I think he did. He has always had a little difficulty distinguishing fiction and reality. I read him something from the newspaper on a Monday, and he tells it back to me on a Wednesday, claiming it happened to him during his schooldays. He never even went to school. That’s why I never took all this stuff about assassination very seriously. Just thought it was one of his whims, one of his quirks. I do hope he’s not come to any harm. I don’t know what I'd do.\nTOBY: And then I met Nurse Albertine - she answered my advertisement in The Lady — and stayed with me after I decided to give up touring.\nCHARDALOT: Oh, is that the time?\nALICE: What a lovely pocket watch, Inspector. May I?\nCHARDALOT: No you may not.\nDOCTOR: Anyway, Toby, why did you give up touring?\nTOBY: Became too dangerous.\nDOCTOR: How so?\nTOBY: Perhaps you’d better ask the Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: As if I'd remember. You saw to that, Toby.\nTOBY: We were simply protecting ourselves.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. You gave him a sharp jab with your cattle-prod when he caught up with you.\nTOBY: That's right.\nDOCTOR: And you’re aware, I assume, that the technology required to power that device ought not to exist on this planet in this time.\nTOBY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Does that help explain how you know the future?\nTOBY: It might. I’ve been around a bit.\nDOCTOR: You’ve travelled in time?\nTOBY: No, not exactly.\nDOCTOR: Don’t talk in riddles, Toby.\nTOBY: Look, I don’t know why you keep on at me. It makes perfect sense to me.\nCHARDALOT: Of course it does, but to the rest of us it’s a lot of mangled nonsense.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see if you do any better, eh, Inspector? You’re a scientist, are you?\nCHARDALOT: Of course.\nDOCTOR: What sort?\nCHARDALOT: What would you like?\nDOCTOR: Am I the only one here who knows his own life story?\nPERI: At last. Something that isn’t a cow or a dyke. And it has hills, too.\nALBERTINE: And it has a little statue of a peeing boy.\nPERI: Pity we’re not here for fun.\nALBERTINE: What’s it saying?\nPERI: The time machine has been switched on.\nALBERTINE: Is it yours?\nPERI: No, it’s not. That marker is still static on the screen, but the new one’s moving real fast. We're going to have company when we get to town. Wonder where it’s homing in on? Let’s have a look at this thing.\nALBERTINE: How ingenious.\nPERI: You know that street?\nALBERTINE: We’re not far away. Place de Brouckére. It’s right by the Hotel Metropole. We stayed there during Toby’s last European tour.\nPERI: Drive on, then.\nCHARDALOT: The experiments were long and complex. I worked into the night. I scarcely ate. I slept at my bench, toiling over my test subjects. There were many failures, but then my two boys, Charlie and Toby, they took. They really took. They grew in their little bell jars until they were smiling back at me through the glass. Then I decided to allow them to take their first halting steps into the world.\nTOBY: Could you pass the mayonnaise please, Miss Bultitude?\nALICE: Of course.\nTOBY: Are you eating that paté?\nALICE: No, I’m not very hungry.\nTOBY: May I?\nALICE: Of course.\nDOCTOR: So what happened after you let them out?\nCHARDALOT: They went snuffling about the laboratory, grubbing apple cores out of the waste paper basket, chewing up my box files. You know what piglets are. But I soon taught them a few manners.\nDOCTOR: What happened to Charlie?\nCHARDALOT: Pneumonia. They put him in a box of shredded newspaper and gave him a little flask of charcoal, fed him warm milk from a pipette.\nDOCTOR: Did he live?\nCHARDALOT: I don’t believe so.\nALICE: Believe, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: It seems so long ago now.\nTOBY: Why are you listening to this, Doctor? The man’s insane.\nDOCTOR: Then humour him.\nTOBY: Why should I?\nCHARDALOT: How sharper than the serpent’s tooth it is.\nTOBY: Then pass me those sandwiches, Doctor, would you?\nCHARDALOT: Touch those boys and you'll regret it.\nDOCTOR: I have a theory about your experimental work, Inspector. Someone created Toby, but I don’t think it was you. Toby’s well-preserved, I know, but don’t let his skill with a make-up box fool you. He’s a good ten years older than you. Did you study arithmetic as well as biology?\nCHARDALOT: I won't listen to this, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But have you ever considered the evidence properly? I would have thought the explanation would have been obvious to the man who triumphed in the case of the murderess of Saint Germain. Being in possession of a man’s diary doesn’t make you that man, you know. I think the real Chardalot died years ago,\nDOCTOR: don’t you? He was a time traveller, wasn’t he? And through him you and Toby have gained the odd bit of garbled foreknowledge. But you’re no more the real Chardalot than I am.\nCHARDALOT: Nonsense.\nDOCTOR: Did you create Toby? Or did someone else create you both?\nCHARDALOT: Impossible!\nDOCTOR: What happened to the real Chardalot? Did he abandon you in this time and place, or did you take against him and eat him for lunch?\nCHARDALOT: Doctor, this is beneath you. Take your trotters off that fruit cake, boy!\nALICE: Don’t speak to him like that!\nCHARDALOT: Put that cake down.\nTOBY: Look, I’ve had just about enough of you. I shall eat it if I wish. Now look what you’ve done! Kicking over the trolley in a fit of temper. The Doctor paid for that, you know.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I didn’t.\nCHARDALOT: Do you remember none of your lessons, Toby? Do you not remember how I taught you to be a gentleman? To hold your knife and fork correctly? To leave a little on your plate so as not to offend your hosts? To wait until food is passed to you. Are you a boy or a pig, huh?\nTOBY: Doctor, we should have him thrown off the train.\nCHARDALOT: Try me, boy.\nDOCTOR: Toby, sit down. Don’t rise to it.\nCHARDALOT: That’s right, boy. Be a man.\nTOBY: I'll do better than that.\nDOCTOR: Don’t do anything stupid, Toby. Let go of the Inspector. Close the carriage door and let him walk back to us.\nTOBY: You just don’t know when to stop, do you, Inspector? You drive a man to murder!\nCHARDALOT: Sorry. Don’t understand. It just sounds like oinking to me. Now sit down and be a sensible piglet.\nDOCTOR: Toby, be careful.\nCHARDALOT: I’m stronger than you, boy. Look, you think you have the muscle to push me through that door, but see, I can move my hand like this, reach down to my waistcoat, and look at my watch as if I was leaning on a breakwater at Ostend, enjoying the sunshine.\nTOBY: We'll see about that.\nALICE: Toby, don’t!\nDOCTOR: Toby, are you all right?\nTOBY: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Toby.\nTOBY: Look, I’m sorry, Doctor, but he deserved it. It was him or me, and that was a cleaner death than going under the vivisectionist’s knife.\nDOCTOR: If only it were that simple. Did you not see what he took out of his pocket?\nTOBY: A fob watch.\nDOCTOR: Why on Earth would a man hanging from a train carriage want to know the time? That wasn’t a fob watch, it was a parachute.\nPERI: Nice hotel, the Metropole. You don’t like roughing it, you and Toby.\nALBERTINE: Nothing more than we deserve. Is there a house number on that little machine?\nPERI: Basement flat number 12. Nice window boxes. Wouldn’t have had him down as a tulip man.\nALBERTINE: So, how do we break in?\nPERI: Let’s establish whether anyone’s at home.\nALBERTINE: Ah. Shall 1?\nPERI: Why not.\nALBERTINE: How long should we wait?\nALBERTINE: Oh. Toby.\nBUTLER: You mistake me, madame. I am only the butler.\nBUTLER: UNDER-BUTLER: (Irish) And I am only the under-butler.\nPERI: You look very familiar.\nBUTLER: I do hope not, madame. Familiarity in our profession would be considered a sacking offence.\nALBERTINE: We have an appointment with your master. I assume he telegraphed to inform you of our arrival.\nALBERTINE: UNDER-BUTLER: He did, madame.\nALBERTINE: Oh, er, well, you’d better let us in, then, hadn’t you.\nBUTLER: Of course, madame. Madame.\nBUTLER: UNDER-BUTLER: May I take madame’s coat?\nPERI: I don’t have one, I’m afraid.\nBUTLER: No matter. Madame can have this one. I'll hang it up for you.\nPERI: Thank you.\nPERI: UNDER-BUTLER: Now, would madame please step into the drawing room.\nBUTLER: And madame.\nALBERTINE: Oh, of course.\nBUTLER: Would the ladies care for an aperitif?\nPERI: Now you’re talking.\nPERI: UNDER-BUTLER: A Campari, perhaps?\nPERI: Yeah.\nBUTLER: With a little soda?\nALBERTINE: Let’s go mad.\nALBERTINE: UNDER-BUTLER: Do be seated.\nPERI: You could drown someone in these armchairs.\nALBERTINE: If you wanted to.\nBUTLER: Madame.\nBUTLER: UNDER-BUTLER: Madame.\nALBERTINE: Bottom’s up.\nPERI: And nibbles, too.\nBUTLER: Devils on horseback, madame? Miniature blini, salted cashew?\nALBERTINE: Well, gesundheit.\nPERI: Here’s mud in your eye.\nALBERTINE: Postman brought you something nice?\nBUTLER: Sorry, madame?\nALBERTINE: Interesting looking packing case in the corner there. What is it, a bathing hut?\nPERI: It wouldn’t be a large wooden box with a lamp on top, would it?\nBUTLER: That would depend, madame, on the position of the observer. For my part, I would describe it as a multidimensional travel capsule for surfing the loops of the time spiral.\nBUTLER: UNDER-BUTLER: Or as I heard our employer describe it scant moments ago, this week’s best chance out of 1913.\nALBERTINE: You mean he’s here already?\nBUTLER: He returned just before you knocked on the door.\nALBERTINE: Oh no!\nCHARDALOT: I'll pretend I didn’t hear that, Nurse Albertine. So sorry to have kept you. Oh dear, you don’t look very pleased to see me. Miss Brown, you appear to be about to vomit into the nut dish. I would have hoped for a more fulsome welcome from a lady who once kissed me on the beach at Ostend.\nDOCTOR: What does a man’s suitcase say about him?\nALICE: Not where he lives. Not in this case, unfortunately. You’d think he would have put a label on the inside lining. Most irresponsible.\nDOCTOR: What have we got? A couple of back-numbers of the Police Gazette. Lovely illustrations.\nALICE: Oh, I remember that chap. Drowned his wife in the bath and then went into the next room and played Nearer My God To Thee on the harmonium.\nDOCTOR: And what's in that paper package?\nALICE: Butter biscuits.\nTOBY: Oh. May I?\nDOCTOR: If you hurry. We’re here.\nALICE: What are we going to do? How are we to find him again?\nDOCTOR: I think I’ve just stopped worrying about that, Miss Bultitude. Look over there on the platform. The man with the cardboard placard and the bowler hat.\nALICE: Oh. Chardalot and party.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. That'll be us, then.\nCHARDALOT: Now, ladies, what are you drinking?\nALBERTINE: Campari and soda.\nCHARDALOT: Marvellous. May I join you? I’ve had quite a day. Not too much ice.\nPERI: What happened to you?\nCHARDALOT: Oh, just a little accident.\nALBERTINE: You ought to let me help you, Inspector. You’re more badly injured than you imagine.\nCHARDALOT: Don't give it a moment’s thought, Nurse Albertine. I'll sort myself out when our little party is concluded. I’d hate to be an inattentive host. Now, isn’t this nice?\nPERI: Might I ask you something about your butlers, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: What about them?\nPERI: Are they clones?\nCHARDALOT: Eh? What do you mean?\nPERI: Clones. Genetic copies.\nCHARDALOT: Genetic? I’m sorry, I must have been away for that. Think of them as rough sketches. Now Toby, he’s my masterpiece.\nALBERTINE: What branch of science did you study, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: Science.\nALBERTINE: Where?\nCHARDALOT: At university. At Combray, on the planet Gamantis.\nPERI: Combray? Are you sure about that?\nCHARDALOT: Of course. I took a room in the old hostelry of the Oiseaux Fleché, from whose windows and the pavement a smell used to rise of cooking which rises still in my mind now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort.\nPERI: Nostalgic for it, are you?\nCHARDALOT: Of course.\nPERI: Then why don’t you go back there and leave us all alone!\nCHARDALOT: If only it was so easy.\nPERI: You arrived before us. You don’t exactly travel by motor car, do you?\nCHARDALOT: No. Look at this. One of my few keep-sakes from home. Wonderful craftsmanship. The filigree work, the astronomical dial. But looks aren’t everything, you know. This device only allows me short gads through time and space. It has a range of about four hundred kilometres and two hours, and it will only take one passenger. Fine if you want to catch this afternoon’s performance of Hello Tango at the London Hippodrome, all alone. Completely useless if you want to take a sapient pig to a scientific conference on the planet Gamantis some half a century hence. Which, by a stroke of bad luck, is exactly what I need to do. (coughs) Do excuse me.\nALBERTINE: Inspector, I think you’ve broken most of your ribs. You have a gash in your neck which is releasing a little trickle of Campari, your speech has begun to slur. I’d urge you to let me look at these wounds.\nCHARDALOT: Yes, it was a rough do, wasn’t it? I’m afraid I was obliged to operate this device while falling from the open door of the express train from Ostend to Brussels. I think I bounced from the tunnel wall before the little thing kicked into action.\nALBERTINE: What happened?\nCHARDALOT: Spot of bother with some livestock. Nothing that need trouble you.\nALBERTINE: You mean Toby. Is Toby all right?\nCHARDALOT: Probably in the buffet car licking under the lid of a jam pot as we speak.\nPERI: But he’s not injured.\nCHARDALOT: No. In fact, my unscheduled arrival here was a consequence of my attempt to protect him from harm. He went for my neck, do you see? Forced me to bail out early.\nPERI: You must be pretty sore about that. You’ve been after him all these years.\nCHARDALOT: Oh, but I didn’t have the Doctor then. I’m sure he can be relied upon to shepherd Toby to this very room. I’m expecting a reunion quite soon.\nPERI: And in the meantime you’re just gonna bleed onto the upholstery?\nALBERTINE: Aren’t you in terrible pain?\nCHARDALOT: We Gamantes don’t really feel pain. I believe we bred out most of our animal weaknesses centuries ago. I know that I am not in any real danger for another couple of hours at least, which is why I decided to join you for cocktails. Chin-chin. Oops. I’m still leaking. So sorry. Look, can’t we just have a normal conversation? Act like ladies and gentlemen?\nPERI: Okay. Why don’t we talk about your diary?\nCHARDALOT: Not you too. I am a scientist. I conduct experiments. I do things with alembics and syringes and Bunsen burners.\nPERI: How do you know you’re not just an experimental subject who got above himself and learned to drink Campari?\nCHARDALOT: Well, Miss Brown, I think we can squash that theory right away. The operating theatre awaits. If you will just let me drink up. Thank you. Gentlemen?\nBUTLER: Sir?\nBUTLER: UNDER-BUTLER: Sir.\nCHARDALOT: I think it’s time you scrubbed up, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Do you know this city well? I’m not sure I’ve been here yet. I remember coming to buy an engagement ring once, but all this had gone by then.\nALICE: An engagement ring? Who was the lucky lady?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it was business, not pleasure, I’m afraid.\nTOBY: I know it. I played the Opera House in ’92, 94 and ’97. Lovely dressing rooms.\nALICE: Can’t we get this man to go any faster?\nDOCTOR: Oh, cabbie? Double the fare if we reach our destination in the next ten minutes.\nALICE: Oh! Good work, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, thank you, yes, but has anyone got any cash on them?\nTOBY: I can cover the expense, but I do wish you hadn’t said that to the driver.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nTOBY: Because we’re here already.\nCHARDALOT: Welcome to my little treatment room, ladies. Sorry for the mess. We’ve only just moved in.\nALBERTINE: You don’t travel light, do you.\nCHARDALOT: If I have the means to bring my possessions with me, why should I leave them behind? Look, I’ve even kept a box of Toby’s toys. How he loved that kaleidoscope.\nPERI: Did he read these books too?\nCHARDALOT: That one was his favourite. Feel free to browse, Miss Brown.\nBUTLER: Sir, we are ready to begin.\nCHARDALOT: Avert your eyes, ladies. I’m just going to slip into the surgical gown.\nPERI: You’d better get a move on.\nCHARDALOT: Yes, you're right, I am beginning to feel rather unwell. But time is still on my side, so I'll just lay back on the operating table and let my servants get hacking away with their saws and scissors, eh?\nPERI: You’re not going to have any gas?\nCHARDALOT: I do not feel pain. Now, turn that monitor my way, would you?\nBUTLER: Of course, sir.\nCHARDALOT: Ah, the right kidney will need replacing. Fortunately I have plenty in the bank. Go and fetch one from the cold store, would you?\nCHARDALOT: UNDER-BUTLER: At once, sir.\nCHARDALOT: They've not had to dig as deep as this for oh, well, a long time. It’s hard to remember. However, the old skills never die. In an hour or so they’ll have done their work and I'll be up and joking with the nurses.\nPERI: No surgeon would operate on a patient without knowing their medical history. Are you sure you know yours, Inspector? Are you sure you’re gonna get this right?\nPERI: UNDER-BUTLER: One kidney, sir, dressed to the right.\nALBERTINE: That doesn’t look good to me. Is that really a human kidney?\nCHARDALOT: Look, I Know what you're driving at, Nurse Albertine, and it must stop. I am aman, a human man. I had a mother and father. They lived in a little cottage with roses around the door. I remember the day I left home. I remember my mother pressing a peppermint into my hand and wishing me luck.\nALBERTINE: Because you were going to London to seek your fortune? Those are Toby’s memories, not yours. Or are they nobody’s?\nCHARDALOT: Enough of this. We'll see who’s the pig and who’s the man.\nCHARDALOT: UNDER-BUTLER: Here’s the relevant organ, sir. We’re ready to begin.\nPERI: Sounds like we might have visitors already, Inspector.\nCHARDALOT: He is nippy, isn’t he, your friend the Doctor. Let’s draw the security curtains.\nBUTLER: Sir.\nCHARDALOT: An electrical barrier has now fallen around the operating table. It will be quite impossible for you to interfere without my consent.\nPERI: A forcefield, is it?\nCHARDALOT: Probably. Make the first incision.\nBUTLER: Immediately, sir.\nALBERTINE: Not like that, you idiot. You’re going to kill him.\nCHARDALOT: Nonsense. Do you hear anything irregular from these monitors? No, so keep your place.\nALBERTINE: I don’t think your staff are qualified to carry out this operation, Inspector. Let them do it and you will die on that table.\nDOCTOR: I'd listen to her, if I were you. It’s good advice.\nCHARDALOT: Good evening, Doctor, Miss Bultitude, boy. You'll excuse me if I don’t get up.\nTOBY: Doctor, those things. They’re versions of me.\nCHARDALOT: Give the pig a toffee apple.\nDOCTOR: Save your strength, Inspector. You’re in a bad way. You pulled the rip-cord a bit too late, didn’t you?\nCHARDALOT: You’re right. But once I’ve been patched up I'll be in a very advantageous position, won’t I? I have your space-time machine, Doctor, and I have Toby. Nurse Albertine no longer possesses her ray gun, and I have the means to detain you all in this house. I’d say I have the winning hand.\nALBERTINE: You might, unless one of those creatures chops it off.\nCHARDALOT: They know how to follow technical procedure. Oh. Suddenly I feel very strange.\nPERI: What happens if something goes wrong? Why take the risk?\nCHARDALOT: I have every confidence in my employees.\nDOCTOR: Maybe you should, if you’re asking them to slice lemons for you, but look at the way he’s holding that scalpel. He’s no idea of what he’s doing.\nALICE: Oh, I can’t watch this. I’m going outside.\nCHARDALOT: Quite impossible, Miss Bultitude. All the external doors have been sealed. You'll just have to put a paper bag over your head.\nTOBY: I have an empty toffee bag.\nCHARDALOT: Toby, you can’t have eaten since you got down from the train. Feeling hungry?\nTOBY: A little.\nCHARDALOT: There may be a dusty old box of liquorish comfits in that tea chest there, or sugared almonds, or some such.\nTOBY: I won’t eat them if they smell poisoned, you know.\nCHARDALOT: You see, I can be an indulgent father. Have a sweetie, boy. Call me Daddy and have a sweetie.\nDOCTOR: You have quite an archive there, Inspector.\nTOBY: My kaleidoscope, and that dear little train set. That book. I love that book. A story about a pig who goes away from his parents, to war or to market or somewhere. But the illustration isn’t quite as I remember it.\nBUTLER: Should I continue, sir?\nCHARDALOT: You’re fine surgeons. I trained you both myself, didn’t I?\nCHARDALOT: UNDER-BUTLER: As you say, sir.\nCHARDALOT: Can anyone smell baking? Is somebody making gingerbread?\nALBERTINE: Inspector, please. These two creatures are your butlers. Of course they’re not going to contradict you. Will you allow them to hack you to pieces just because of your pride? There’s no need to replace that kidney. You'll do just fine without it.\nCHARDALOT: But I’ve always had two.\nALBERTINE: You know nothing about human physiology, do you. Listen, I’ll do the work for you. I'll make it better. Inspector, I love Toby, and you are like Toby in some way. I don’t know how but you are. Give me the needle and thread, give me the plaster of Paris, and send those butchers away.\nTOBY: Albertine, you’d help him, and you love me? You love me and you’d help him?\nALBERTINE: A man is dying. Don’t you care?\nTOBY: I don’t know. I feel as if someone were about to tear me to pieces. This picture, Albertine. This picture.\nDOCTOR: I think we should all take a look. I'll hold it up, Inspector, so you can see. The little cottage with the roses around the door, the bees going from flower to flower. See who’s standing in the doorway. Two pigs, one in a waistcoat, one in an apron.\nCHARDALOT: Mummy and Daddy.\nDOCTOR: I wish it was true, Inspector. I really do. And look here, what do you see, hmm? Who are these figures waving goodbye to?\nCHARDALOT: It’s hard to see.\nDOCTOR: Tell him, Toby.\nTOBY: Two little piglets, at the garden gate, with little knapsacks. There are little tears rolling down their cheeks.\nPERI: This is your past, Toby, and it’s yours too, Inspector. But it never happened. Just a shared dream about a watercolour painting, a story you told yourselves, you and Toby, when you were children, when someone, some madman, some deranged doctor kept you in a lab like this.\nCHARDALOT: I don’t... I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Of course you don’t. You and Toby have pieced together the evidence and you’ve got it wrong. You’ve truffled through the personal effects of the man who made you, whoever he was, you’ve taken his scientific notes and his alien gadgets and his clothes and his books, and you’ve been play-acting with them ever since.\nTOBY: But I was born in Essex! I ran away to go on the stage!\nDOCTOR: You were born in one of the test tubes in this lab, Toby. You did go on the stage, but the rest is in that picture book. And as for all that stuff about evolution having taken the wrong course...\nTOBY: And what about him?\nCHARDALOT: I am from Gamantis. I am one of the Gamantes.\nDOCTOR: No, you're not, Inspector. The Gamantes. The Guermantes. And who are the Guermantes, Peri?\nPERI: They’re in Proust. They live in a castle at Combray. The narrator idolises the family, wants to be part of it, but he never will.\nDOCTOR: Your creator did his work well. I can’t be very sure of his sanity or his morals, but he achieved what he wanted. He came here from some other world - not Gamantis, there’s no such place as Gamantis — but wherever he came from and whatever his motives, he did something extraordinary. He brought two boys\nDOCTOR: into the world. And his boys have really made something of themselves. One went on the stage, had a wonderful career, fell in love. The other, little Charlie, the younger and more confused of the pair, well, it’s harder to say what he’s been up to. Trying and failing to continue his creator’s work, making notes in his creator’s note book, driving himself half-mad in the attempt to maintain the illusion of his own history. But I’m sure it’s not too late for him to reform. What do you think, Inspector?\nCHARDALOT: I... I’m not feeling very well. I can’t see the room.\nTOBY: We were both under the knife. I thought it was just me, but you must have been there too, in that pen, sleeping in straw, sitting up at the dinner table with a rap over the knuckles with a ruler if you slurped your soup. You're not my father, Inspector. You’re not my tormentor. You’re my brother. You must have been there at my side. Come back to it now. Make those creatures put down the knives.\nCHARDALOT: Very well. You heard. Stand down.\nBUTLER: We shall desist, sir. And might I suggest that my colleague and I prepare some light refreshments?\nCHARDALOT: Do it. Lower the security curtain. And find some of those little biscuits for our guests.\nALBERTINE: Right, Doctor, are you going to stand there gawping or are you going to get some soap and offer me some help? This man’s life is in our hands.\nTOBY: The orchards of England, how I remember them.\nPERI: Do you remember them?\nTOBY: Well, to be honest, no. But they’re jolly nice, all the same.\nALICE: Here we are. Chauffoir chicken garnished with crayfish and stoned cherries.\nALBERTINE: Miss Bultitude, you are an excellent cook.\nALICE: Yes, I am. Just as well, isn’t it? Well, it’s all ready. Someone had better fetch the Doctor.\nPERI: I'll go and get him. He’s just reading his book by the summer house\nTOBY: Can we start?\nALBERTINE: No. Not until we’re all sitting together. We have an announcement to make.\nTOBY: Oh yes.\nPERI: So, you've finished it, then\nDOCTOR: Yes. It didn’t really spoil the ending, you know, what you said about him being hit by a car.\nPERI: I’m not that mean.\nDOCTOR: He’s a difficult man to spend six volumes with, though, isn’t he? Particularly when he spends so much of them fixating on an idea that turns out to be a waste of time.\nPERI: And full of nostalgia for something that you suspect may never really have existed.\nDOCTOR: Well, nostalgia’s not a terminal condition. In pigs, at least.\nPERI: What about pigs with a history of impersonating officers?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I wonder what he’s doing?\nPERI: I don’t know. Maybe he'll do what he said, apply for a position with the detective police. There’d be something fitting about him doing it for real when he’s lied about it for so long.\nDOCTOR: I suppose in time he might come to visit his brother. But he might just stay hidden. Why let horrible facts get in the way of a sustaining fantasy? I almost hope neither of them ever discovers the whole truth about their childhood.\nPERI: I guess. What good would it do them? Who wants to know that they should never have been born?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t think there’s any danger of them finding out too much. Whoever conducted the experiments to produce Toby and Charlie, their secrets died with them. They weren't from this time or this planet, but beyond that it’s impossible to say. I think it’s best if it remains that way.\nPERI: That lot seem happy enough, don’t they?\nDOCTOR: Miss Bultitude has her idol living in her spare room.\nPERI: I only hope Albertine can stand the competition.\nDOCTOR: Do you think it might be time to er...\nPERI: Slip away? Probably, yes.\nDOCTOR: The delivery men left the Tardis at the back gate.\nPERI: So, shall we?\nDOCTOR: Lets.\nTOBY: Doctor! Peri!\nALBERTINE: They’re not here.\nTOBY: Do you think...\nALBERTINE: I suppose that settles the question.\nTOBY: He’s left his book behind.\nALBERTINE: Oh yes.\nTOBY: Time Regained.\nALBERTINE: What's it like?\nTOBY: Not bad, but it might taste better with a little vinaigrette."
