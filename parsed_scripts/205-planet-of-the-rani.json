No-one remembers how.\nCHOWDRAS: They’1l soon all be dead.\nDEGOOR: Apart from one. How is little Kahnu?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 4\nDOCTOR WHO: DEGOOR AND CHOWDRAS ENTER.\nCHOWDRAS: He’s not strong... but he was always her favourite. Her little princeling. Oh, yes.\nCHOWDRAS: One year old and brighter than youngsters three times his age.\nDEGOOR: And his sleep?\nCHOWDRAS: He never sleeps — not that it seems to worry him.\nDEGOOR: Why was he left unguarded?\nCHOWDRAS: There are no guards left! The rest of us are exhausted. We’ve tried putting him on a monitor.. but he pulls it apart. He’s fascinated by its workings.\nDEGOOR: Keep Kahnu alive, Chowdras. Forget the rest. Our beloved Rani, a thousand blessings upon her, will not reward total failure when she returns. At least offer her one success.\nCHOWDRAS: She scares you as much as the rest of us. Hasn’t she done enough damage?\nDEGOOR: She is our ruler. Remember that. And she will return.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: RECEPTION/LIFT/CELL\nGUARD: Gurney coming through.\nGOVERNOR: Thank you, guard seven-two-one. All checks finalised. Identity confirmed. Prisoner Indigo zero one eleven three six sigma received. — Close the gate, will you?\nGUARD: Sir.\nGOVERNOR: Welcome to Teccaurora High Security Penitentiary, madam. I am the Governor. I trust your expedition from court wasn’t too uncomfortable? (NO ANSWER) Right. Bring her down, seven-two- one.\nGOVERNOR: THE GOVERNOR AND THE GUARD WALK IN WITH IT. THE LIFT DOOR CLOSES. THE LIFT DESCENDS. FLOORS THRUM PAST.\nGOVERNOR: Your cell is in Sigma block. That’s eighteen levels down. Not much of a view, I’m afraid. (SILENCE) Well... the first few days here are always a shock, but we pride ourselves on our facilities. Most inmates find them stimulating. We’ve an extensive library with particular reference to the arts and science — chemistry is your field, I understand. I’m sure you’1ll find much to engage you.\nGOVERNOR: From now on, you’ll be addressed by your registration number. Your previous identity no longer exists. Everyone is equal\nGOVERNOR: here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 6\nGOVERNOR: And this is it. Your home for the duration of your sentence... (FX: HE CONSULTS A PAPER) .. which in your case, amounts to the rest of your life. — Right. House rules are listed on your\nGOVERNOR: facility console. Lights and heating are controlled from outside. The bathroom’s through there. Any questions? (SILENCE) No? Very good. Then I’11l leave you to settle in.\nRANI: How many others?\nGOVERNOR: Hmm?\nRANI: How many other prisoners?\nGOVERNOR: We hold nine hundred high security prisoners. Despite our endeavours, there’s always a stream of offenders to keep us busy. But don’t worry. You won’t be ignored. Your rehabilitation starts here.\nRANI: How reassuring... to know that I am not alone.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: CHIMES.\nCONSTANCE: Oh, for goodness’ sake, Doctor. How many of these electronic ‘letters’ have gone unanswered?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t worry, ‘Mrs Clarke’. Most are unsolicited interplanetary spam. Easily deleted.\nCONSTANCE: Spam? That’s what the GIs brought with them. — I mean, look at all these. What you need is a personal secretary.\nDOCTOR: Are you applying for the job?\nCONSTANCE: No, I am not.\nDOCTOR: Ah... well... I’m delighted to hear it.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nCONSTANCE: Even So...\nDOCTOR: Yes!\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nCONSTANCE: Oh, never mind.\nDOCTOR: All relevant correspondence will be answered in good time. The tiresome strictures of a linear existence are rendered irrelevant when you travel in time. It’s all relative, you know.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 8\nDOCTOR: And ‘missing the post’ becomes a thing of the past. — Ooh, look. Apparently my systems are running too slowly.\nDOCTOR: So we can lose that for a start off.\nCONSTANCE: The ‘Tecc-au-rora High Security Penitentiary’? What’s that? Sounds like a prison.\nDOCTOR: Oh, just administrative. Best ignored.\nCONSTANCE: But it’s marked URGENT.\nDOCTOR: Nothing to worry about.\nCONSTANCE: There are more of them. Plenty more. All from the same place.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. Whose private mailbox is this?\nCONSTANCE: But it looks important. (FX: BLIPS CONSOLE.) “Dear Doctor...”\nDOCTOR: No!\nCONSTANCE: “We have made numerous attempts to request your attendance at a parole hearing for the prisoner...”\nDOCTOR: Parole!\nCONSTANCE: “..cthe prisoner Ushas of Mee-a-simia Goria.”\nDOCTOR: My — asimia.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 9\nCONSTANCE: Someone you know?\nDOCTOR: Maybe. (GIVES IN) An old opponent of mine, since you’re asking.\nCONSTANCE: And he’s in prison?\nDOCTOR: The Rani is a She.\nCONSTANCE: Oh.\nDOCTOR: And not the first of my academic contemporaries to land up behind bars either. We were a vintage year.\nCONSTANCE: You should have met mine at Somerville.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nCONSTANCE: So what did ‘the Rani’ do?\nDOCTOR: How long have you got? Her list of crimes is extensive to say the least. A brilliant mind corrupted... but ‘parole’ is not what I’d expected. Not ever.\nCONSTANCE: Then surely that’s even more reason to attend the hearing.\nDOCTOR: You can be quite persistent when you want to be, can’t you, Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: Only trying to be helpful.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Oh, alright. My guilt is needled quite enough. (FX: HE\nSTARTS: BLIPPING IN COORDINATES) Prison visiting was not on my immediate agenda, but anything for a bit of peace and quiet.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 10\nMONTAIN: Sigma block. We’re waiting on your connection.\nGUARD: (ON COMM) Problems with the restraint webbing, sir.\nMONTAIN: Well, get on with it. The Governor’s waiting.\nGUARD: (COMM) Sir.\nMONTAIN: All blocks. Standby to commence the feed regime in ten params.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 11\nMONTAIN: (TANNOY — SLIGHT ECHO) Check all monitors and input feed clearance. Repeat — feed regime commences in ten params.\nWAY: INTO REALITY. DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: (EMERGING) No, no. I always bypass reception desks. What’s the point of a surprise inspection if your arrival is anticipated?\nCONSTANCE: (FOLLOWING) Poo-er! They could open a few windows round here.\nDOCTOR: You’1l be lucky. (FX: CLOSES TARDIS DOOR) This Penitentiary is Situated at the heart of the Teccaurora Diamond Belt. They built the whole complex inside an asteroid. It’s well-nigh escape proof... allegedly.\nCONSTANCE: It didn’t stop us getting in.\nDOCTOR: Exactly my point. Standards are obviously slipping.\nDOCTOR: These cells have held some notorious criminals in their time. The Immazma Smythe gang, Poldrini the Cold...\nCONSTANCE: They sound more like variety acts.\nDOCTOR: That’s truer than you think. I wonder which block they’ve housed the Rani in...\nCONSTANCE: We might have to check each of the cells in turn. They appear to have peepholes of sorts.\nDOCTOR: Careful.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 12\nCONSTANCE: Oh! The prisoner’s strapped up to a machine.\nDOCTOR: Can I see? Oh, yes. Probably some sort of medication.\nDOCTOR: PANEL. THE DOCTOR FOLLOWS.\nCONSTANCE: This one’s the same.\nDOCTOR: Now that looks more like enforced sedation... which I understood was banned in this establishment. Criminals have rights, too. If I’d known I’d have thought twice about having the Rani sent here.\nCONSTANCE: You had her imprisoned?\nDOCTOR: I had a little influence over the matter. But she’d left the authorities no choice. She always was her own worst enemy.\nCONSTANCE: She really is that bad?\nDOCTOR: Regrettably, yes. (FX: HE SLIDES OPEN ANOTHER PANEL) Oh, and here’s another. — Have they knocked out the entire prison\nDOCTOR: population? Where are all the staff?\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? Is that a film camera, up there? Are we being watched?\nDOCTOR: Very probably. (ALOUD) Excuse me. Hello! This is the Doctor. You requested my attendance... [at a hearing].\nPAZMI: (DISTANT)\nCONSTANCE: What was that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 13\nDOCTOR: Someone’s enjoying themselves.\nPAZMI: (DISTANT) Doctor! (SCREAMS )\nDOCTOR: Along here!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, wait! Whoever that was, she was calling your name!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 14\nPAZMI: LYING IN BED, RAMBLING DELIRIOUSLY AS SHE SENSES THINGS\nBEFORE: THEY HAPPEN.\nPAZMI: You’re taking your time. (LAUGHING) But it’1l never work. Oh. Oh, he’s here.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE, THROUGH OPENING) Hello? Were you calling me?\nPAZMI: Must be eight params to go by now.\nCONSTANCE: (OUTSIDE) She’s connected up like the others.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) Hello? Can we help?\nPAZMI: Who are you? (IMITATING THE DOCTOR) “I’m the Doctor. I always cut things fine.”\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) I’m the... ah.. You were expecting me?\nCONSTANCE: (OUTSIDE) Is she delirious?\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) Very possibly.\nPAZMI: (FORESEEING) The door’s open.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) Hang on while I circumvent the door lock.\nPAZMI: I said “the door’s open.”\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE)\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nDOCTOR WHO: What?\nPAZMI: (FORESEEING) “Try the handle.”\nCONSTANCE: (OUTSIDE) It’s open. Try the...\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) Try the handle. Yes, I know!\nPAZMI: You took your time.\nDOCTOR: Page 15\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Cutting things fine is an occupational hazard.\nPAZMI: (IMMITATING DOCTOR) “And this is erm.. Mrs Clarke.”\nDOCTOR: And this is...\nCONSTANCE: How did you know that?\nDOCTOR: Precognitive empathy?\nPAZMI: I knew you’d say that. (SHE GASPS WITH PAIN,\nLAUGH: )\nCONSTANCE: What are they doing to you?\nPAZMI: Watch out for the guards. Look out!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 16\nCONSTANCE: We haven’t seen any guards.\nDOCTOR: But there will be. Am I right... (FX: HE TURNS A PAPER DOCUMENT) (READS) .. “prisoner amber nine eight four nine delta?”\nPAZMI: Pazmi. That’s what my mother called me.\nCONSTANCE: Pazmi.\nDOCTOR: What are you in for? — And what have they connected you up to?\nCONSTANCE: You said it was medication.\nPAZMI: Don’t touch!\nCONSTANCE: Sorry! But all the other prisoners we’ve seen are attached to an identical set-up.\nDOCTOR: Pazmi, have you always predicted the future? Or is it only Since they locked you up?\nPAZMI: We have seers amongst our people. Wise ones who see the future the way the rest of us remember the past. Who’d have thought I’d be like them?\nDOCTOR: Your home planet being? No, let me guess. You came here from Miasimia Goria. Am I right?\nPAZMI: I should never have left.\nCONSTANCE: Didn’t you say that’s where the Rani came from?\nPAZMI: (CONTEMPT) The Rani, ten thousand curses upon her.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 17\nDOCTOR: Not a fan then. But you still consider her your ruler? Even in absentia?\nPAZMI: She’s a tyrant.\nDOCTOR: But she’s a prisoner here, yes? She is still here? (SUDDEN THOUGHT) You weren’t trying to spring her?\nPAZMI: (AMUSED) No. (IMMITATING DOCTOR) “Then why are you locked up?”\nDOCTOR: Then why are you... Will you stop doing that!\nCONSTANCE: But she wasn’t — not locked up, I mean. The door was open.\nDOCTOR: Ah...\nCONSTANCE: (WORRIED) Maybe we shouldn’t stay.\nPAZMI: (IMMITATING DOCTOR) “Pazmi? What happens next?”\nCONSTANCE: (TO DOCTOR) Is that what you were going to say?\nDOCTOR: A vague approximation. — You’re not so good at this prediction malarkey, are you? What about the Rani? Did you find her?\nPAZMI: The future’s just ahead, eager to happen. It’s hard to keep up. Like seeing two places at once. Now and next.\nDOCTOR: And what can you see?\nPAZMI: (LAUGHS) Not good. Not far.\nDOCTOR: How far?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 18\nPAZMI: Look out!\nPAZMI: BEAT.\nCONSTANCE: Still no guards. We should go.\nDOCTOR: And if I disconnect your drip feed?\nPAZMI: No!\nCONSTANCE: Don’t touch. You’1ll hurt her!\nDOCTOR: What is this stuff, anyway?\nDOCTOR: (SNIFFS) I know that smell — like nothing at all. Where have I\nDOCTOR: smelt that before?\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, reconnect her.\nDOCTOR: That’s enough of that. You’re better off without it.\nCONSTANCE: Look out! Here come those guards!\nPAZMI: Told you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 19\nGUARD: Don’t move! (FX: BLIPS HIS COMMUNICATOR) Two intruders, sir.

I demand to see the Governor!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 20\nMONTAIN: (DEPUTY GOVERNOR) (TANNOY — SLIGHT ECHO) Stand by. Automated feed regime commences in five params.\nDOORS: SLIDE AND SLAM SHUT ECHOING UP THROUGH THE PRISON.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 21\nMONTAIN: Doctor. I’m Deputy Governor Montain. Please take a seat, both of you. We have been anticipating your visit for some time.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Deputy. This is my associate, Mrs Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: Hello.\nMONTAIN: Excuse the abruptness of your reception. There are protocols which all visitors to the Penitentiary must complete before disembarkation.\nCONSTANCE: And our unexpected arrival breached your security?\nMONTAIN: Most certainly. There will be an enquiry.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s good to keep you on your toes. Particularly when you’re patently so “busy”.\nMONTAIN: Always “busy”, Doctor. (FX: HE TURNS A PAGE) Now then, you were asked to attend a fiftieth anniversary review hearing about one of our inmates.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nMONTAIN: In fact, that request was sent out some forty-seven years ago, under the aegis of one of our previous governors.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I’ve been busy too.\nCONSTANCE: The Doctor was concerned about your other prisoners.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 22\nDOCTOR: From what we saw, they were being subjected to a regime of unprecedented experimentation.\nMONTAIN: Merely part of our on-going sociological study into the working of the criminal mind.\nDOCTOR: Now that’s interesting - because to my untrained eye, the cells resembled a row of laboratory rats. One prisoner to a cubicle.\nCONSTANCE: The woman we spoke to was in considerable distress.\nMONTAIN: Officially your visit is to discuss Prisoner indigo one eleven three six sigma.\nDOCTOR: That’s very impersonal, isn’t it? I prefer Ushas... which I grant you, she does not. She likes to be called The Rani.\nCONSTANCE: Until you had her confined.\nDOCTOR: For everyone’s own good, I told you. She was a menace to the Universe. — So how is she, Deputy? Still sulking? Or making\nDOCTOR: herself useful for a change? She was always alarmingly diligent in her pursuit of creating chaos.\nMONTAIN: She was one of our model inmates.\nCONSTANCE: She “was”?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I was afraid you’d say that.\nMONTAIN: In fact, we owe her a tremendous debt.\nDOCTOR: The Rani!? Oh, please. Next you’1ll be telling us she’s completely reformed. Where is she? Surely you haven’t let her go!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nRANI: Don’t fret, Doctor. I am still here.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I should have known it. Given you the run\nDOCTOR: have they?\nMONTAIN: Good morning, Governor.\nCONSTANCE: Governor!\nDOCTOR: Oh, good grief.\nRANI: Page 23\nRANI: of the place,\nRANI: You expected less? I always maximise the assets available.\nRANI: Surely you know that by now?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 24\nMONTAIN: (TANNOY — SLIGHT ECHO) Stand by. Automated feed regime commences in three params.\nPAZMI: Doctor? Why did you disconnect me? What happens next? I can’t remember. I can’t see anymore.\nPAZMI: I just know it’s horrible!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 25\nDOCTOR: I’m amazed you’re still here, Rani. Not out on the loose, causing your own inimitable brand of mayhem across the galaxy.\nRANI: As opposed to your nauseating line in pompous do-gooding.\nDOCTOR: Mr Montain, I want to register my astonishment at Galactic Security’s lack of judgement over this appointment.\nMONTAIN: She is the best person for the task.\nRANI: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Dear, oh dear.\nCONSTANCE: Excuse me, but what task?\nMONTAIN: (FLOUNDERING) Well, I erm...\nCONSTANCE: How can anyone put a convicted criminal in charge of a prison?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she can be very persuasive. Besides, a prison would make an ideal base for whatever nefarious scheme she’s engaged on at present. When she needs another subject to experiment on — she Simply opens another cage.\nCONSTANCE: But that’s unspeakable.\nRANI: This is your latest devoted pupil, I take it? Another Earthling of course.\nCONSTANCE: Leading Wren Clarke, ma’am.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 26\nRANI: Oh, very good. The military.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, ma’am.\nRANI: You'd better be warned, Clarke, the Doctor’s not as reliable as he pretends. You have only to look at his record for keeping appointments to see that.\nDOCTOR: Everything in its own time.\nRANI: As we all know to our cost.\nMONTAIN: Governor, the latest test feed is about to start.\nRANI: I think we’ve rehearsed the procedure enough. Now the Doctor’s here, we can finally run the transfer programme in full.\nMONTAIN: Of course. (FX: HE CLICKS ON HIS COMMUNICATOR) Security. Two guards to my office please.\nDOCTOR: (TO RANI) Hang on. Have you been waiting all this time for me? Is it revenge? Is that it?\nRANI: You’ve kept me waiting ninety-seven years, Doctor. There have been thirteen Prison Governors here since you had me incarcerated. Some lasted longer than others. Two actually died at that desk.\nDOCTOR: Of natural causes, I hope.\nRANI: I had to make my own way somehow - slowly winning trust and benefits and ultimately authority. Less worthy contenders would have festered and lost their wits.\nDOCTOR: Worthy!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 27\nRANI: But I am nothing if not patient.\nGUARD: Ready, Governor.\nCONSTANCE: Aren’t there checks to stop this? Surely there must be checks!\nDOCTOR: It depends on who’s making the rules. — Come on, Mr Montain. Don’t just sit there!\nMONTAIN: I erm...\nDOCTOR: Wake up, man! Do something! You must have superiors at Galactic Security! Do they even know this has happened?\nRANI: Don’t blame him. It’s not his fault you never answer letters. — Guards, bring these two up to Alpha level. The Pathfinder suite is already prepared.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 28\nMONTAIN: (TANNOY — SLIGHT ECHO) Stand by. Automated feed regime commencing.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 29\nRANI: Alpha level.\nDOCTOR: What now, Rani? Since you’ve elevated yourself so high, you could leave any time you like.\nRANI: And waste the resources here? We’re not all fools.\nCONSTANCE: Why are you blaming the Doctor? You’re a criminal. It’s not his fault you got caught and punished.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but she doesn’t have her TARDIS, you see. Poor old Rani - what rotten luck. Like losing part of yourself. I know how I'd feel.\nRANI: I’ve found other compensations.\nDOCTOR: Really? Let me guess. You’ve taken up embroidery. Or playing the cello.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. Too much.\nDOCTOR: Why? Her welfare has always been close to my hearts. — I heard they had excellent facilities here. That’s why I chose it. As prisons go, this is one of the best.\nRANI: And I am eternally grateful, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Why? What does that mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 30\nRANI: Come and see for yourself, from the Gallery.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 31\nGALLERY: OVERLOOKS A COLLOSSAL ECHOING CHAMBER.\nGALLERY: DIRECTIONS. RANI, DOCTOR, CONSTANCE AND GUARDS STEP IN.\nCONSTANCE: (AWED) Oh, my goodness.\nDOCTOR: Well, I have to hand it to you, Rani. You’ve surpassed yourself this time. Huge. Magnificent. But what exactly is it for?\nCONSTANCE: It’s some sort of astrolabe, isn’t it? Like a calibrated navigation device - only we’re on the inside.\nDOCTOR: Oh, very good.\nRANI: It’s an armillary sphere capable of defining any given position in the cosmos.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. But why?\nRANI: For an experiment I have in mind.\nDOCTOR: Constructed at tax-payers’ expenses, I assume. And what do they think they’re funding? A new exercise yard?\nECHOES: START FIRST, BOUNCING ROUND THE CHAMBER.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Hello! — Oh, that’s intriguing. You’ve created a loopback timefield at the centre. It throws things back before they’ve happened.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 32\nCONSTANCE: Like Pazmi echoing the future.\nDOCTOR: (SUSPICIOUS) Yes. Interesting. This is very technological for you, Rani. Have you abandoned biological research?\nRANI: It will form the entrance to an artificial time portal.\nDOCTOR: Leading where? Back to your palatial bolthole on Miasimia Goria? That’s a fair stretch in spatial terms - so I assume the trip also involves time travel.\nRANI: Of course. I shall return to my world as soon after my initial departure as possible.\nDOCTOR: In a bit of a state when you left, was it?\nRANI: Nothing that will not be rectified.\nDOCTOR: Just saying. But you’1ll still need a quantum-sized supply of energy to power the thing. And a navigator - someone to channel it beyond the linear horizon - preferably... (REALISING) a live one. Ah...\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? What’s happened?\nDOCTOR: I wish I hadn’t thought of that. A Pathfinder? Is that what you\nDOCTOR: said?\nRANI: Guards — strap him into the cubicle!\nCONSTANCE: What are you doing? Leave him alone!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 33\nRANI: And put her in the holding cells.\nCONSTANCE: (DEPARTING) Take your hands off!

Commence stage one in thirty seconds.\nDOCTOR: Rani, I hardly dare ask where you’re getting the energy to run this experiment.\nRANI: Every living mind in the universe contains a residue of temporal energy.\nDOCTOR: Miniscule amounts. Barely enough to budge a couple of atoms. The extraction process would be impossible to sustain.\nRANI: This penitentiary holds nine hundred selected prisoners. But that’s more than enough!\nRANI: (TANNOY) Stage one — commence.\nRANI: A HUM OF POWER STARTS TO BUILD.\nDOCTOR: You’re combining all the inmates’ mental capacity? All of them?\nRANI: Correct.\nDOCTOR: To generate a time vector field through which you can escape? Well, apart from being obscene, it’s also insane. It won’t work. No minds can be that focussed. There’s too much else going on. Too many thoughts.\nRANI: May I remind you of an experiment you once conducted during our Academy days?\nRANI: (TANNOY) Stand by — stage two.\nDOCTOR: That’s going back a bit. What an egotistical bunch of know-alls we were. We thought we’d rule the universe. I hardly think any nonsense we came up with then would be relevant here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 37\nRANI: You had something of the genius about you, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Really? Oh, do you think so?\nRANI: . before you went astray. (TANNOY) Stage two in thirty seconds.\nDOCTOR: Astray!\nRANI: You created the Ablative...\nDOCTOR: The Ablative? Oh, yes. I remember. What a pretentious name.\nRANI: A grey bacteria so basic, it verged on nothing at all. And it reduced everything it contacted to the same rudimentary level.\nDOCTOR: You know that nearly got me expelled. The Academy hushed up the ensuing chaos and destroyed all my samples. And quite right too. It was very embarrassing.\nRANI: Not all the samples were destroyed.\nDOCTOR: What?\nRANI: I kept one.\nDOCTOR: A sample? Of the Ablative?! Here?!\nRANI: Unlike you, I have strategic facilities and deposit accounts scattered across the galaxy — simple enough for me to access.\nDOCTOR: You’ve been locked up too long. This is my fault.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nRANI: I’ve hardly been locked up at all. And with a few your Ablative has proved immensely useful.

This may hurt. (SHE WRENCHES THE FEED FREE)\nPAZMI: Sorry. But I had to get the drip feed off you.\nCONSTANCE: (DAZED) What is that stuff?\nPAZMI: Don’t touch! You only got a small starter dose. Your mind will clear.\nCONSTANCE: I was with the Doctor. Can you still see the future?\nPAZMI: No. Not now. He disconnected me, too. That’s how I got out.\nCONSTANCE: And that woman... she was there. The Rani.\nPAZMI: You’ve seen her? Where? Where is she now?\nCONSTANCE: I can’t...\nPAZMI: You must remember. I have to kill her!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 40\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS) You’ve refined my Ablative bacteria further?\nRANI: I’ve reprogrammed it. It pares down the prisoners’ thoughts so that all extraneous processes are cleared. They focus on one Single instruction.\nDOCTOR: Which you plant in their thoughts.\nRANI: They become the generator. One single blaze of temporal energy. A wave to carry me home.\nDOCTOR: Down a sinkhole to Miasimia Goria. Their minds will be burnt out. Nine hundred lives sacrificed. And yet another atrocity in your name!\nRANI: Unfortunately I also need one specific mind, a Pathfinder, to see a way through the maelstrom of the time vortex.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. No, you’re not using me. — My TARDIS is here. Stop this madness and I’1ll take you wherever you want to go.\nRANI: And trick me back to Gallifrey? I wouldn’t be seen dead in your clapped-out jalopy! I could have left any time. I was waiting for you!\nDOCTOR: You never lost your propensity for spitefulness, did you? It’s what always defeats you in the end.\nRANI: I’ve worked towards this moment for years... decades! You’re not wrecking it now.\nRANI: (TANNOY) Stand by for final phase.

Would I have died too?\nDOCTOR: Yes...\nPAZMI: But you’re still alive.\nDOCTOR: She needed me. She set the co-ordinates in my head. I saw straight though the vortex. To Miasimia Goria.\nPAZMI: But that’s my home. My world. I was meant to stop her!\nDOCTOR: Constance tried that. Look what happened.\nPAZMI: I was so close! I could have killed the Rani!\nDOCTOR: You’re an assassin?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 47\nSECURITY: LEADER (TANNOY ) Attention!

We can’t stay here.\nCONSTANCE: No... please... (COUGHS) The air.. it’s thick... dusty...\nRANI: After ninety-seven years of conditioned air, it smells like wine! Come on! It’1ll soon be light.\nCONSTANCE: (STRUGGLING UP) Where are we?\nRANI: Two hundred and sixty light years from Teccaurora. But on my personal time scale, not long after I left. — Welcome to\nRANI: Miasimia Goria!\nCONSTANCE: It’s so old.

Resistance will be countered.\nSECURITY: If the Doctor is in the complex, he must make himself known to Security officers.\nDOCTOR: (STILL WEARY) This way.\nPAZMI: Why come back down here? You said you had a ship.\nDOCTOR: I do. Come on, before Security ropes us in.\nMONTAIN: No further.\nDOCTOR: Mr Montain? Drop the gun and get out of the way.\nMONTAIN: They’re all dead. Every prisoner in every cell.\nDOCTOR: You know who’s responsible. This is the Rani’s legacy. She leaves death and misery wherever she goes.\nMONTAIN: Ridiculous. She was the best governor we ever had.\nPAZMI: Don’t you know what she’s done?\nMONTAIN: There’1l be an enquiry, of course. You’1ll be needed for that.\nDOCTOR: That’s your problem.

We’re not staying. Summoning the Police is one thing...\nPAZMI: Whoa...\nDOCTOR: . but having to explain myself to them? Life’s too short! — You may want to freshen up before we reach Miasimia Goria.\nPAZMI: We're travelling already?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. We’re a long way from Teccaurora by now.

She’s a hunted criminal.\nDOCTOR: Your lift home is on one condition: that you promise not to kill the Rani. (BEAT) Her crimes are manifold — not just on your world. She must face a higher level of justice. Promise me.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nPAZMI: Of course, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I mean it.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nPAZMI: Will we reach home before her? And your friend?\nDOCTOR: Ah, now that may be another bone of contention. As the designated Pathfinder, I should advise you that the Rani’s planned arrival point may not be quite when she expected.\nPAZMI: You tricked her?\nDOCTOR: Just a small temporal diversion - a few digits off, that’s all I could manage. But it’s what Constance has been dragged into that worries me. And what the Rani will do when they get there.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 54\nCONSTANCE: No-one here either.\nRANI: I can see that. Where are my staff? The lazy dogs...\nCONSTANCE: How do I get back to the Doctor?\nRANI: Well, since you’ve burdened me with your presence...\nCONSTANCE: It wasn’t deliberate.\nRANI: .. you can forget about him and make yourself useful.\nCONSTANCE: Forget the Doctor?\nRANI: If you want to survive. Think about it. (FX: SHE PULLS BACK A DRAPE) Ugh... Dust everywhere.

Someone’s been having a riot.\nRANI: In my Palace!\nCONSTANCE: (READS) ‘Death to the Rani’ on the walls. All these statues — their heads have been knocked off.\nRANI: Imbeciles. They think to erase me from their history!\nCONSTANCE: Were these statues supposed to be of you? Sorry, but they’re not much of a likeness, are they? The hair’s all wrong.\nRANI: This damage isn’t recent. It must have happened years ago. — (REALISATION) He did this! The Doctor!\nCONSTANCE: The Doctor?\nRANI: I fed him the co-ordinates. He should have been incapable of\nRANI: altering them.\nCONSTANCE: (HALF AMUSED) Ohh, so he’s sent you to the wrong place?\nRANI: The right place, at the wrong time.

HE OPERATES THE AIRCRAFT BY REMOTE CONTROL.\nROACH: NB: KAHNU’S VOICE IS PERMANENTLY AMPLIFIED FROM INSIDE THE SUIT AND IS SLIGHTLY TINNY.\nKAHNU: (NERVOUSLY EXCITED) Fifteen hundred spans and climbing! It’s working, Chowdras!\nCHOWDRAS: Indeed, Raj Kahnu.\nKAHNU: Let’s take it up to sixteen. (FX: DISTANT PLANE BUZZ RISES IN PITCH) Seventeen!\nDEGOOR: Another success, my Prince, yes.\nKAHNU: I knew it would fly. I worked out every principle myself — every calculation. (LAUGHING) Days of work.\nCHOWDRAS: And long nights. It is a task for the rest of us to keep pace with you.\nKAHNU: This is a toy. You wait till I build a full-scale version! A manned flight engine!\nDEGOOR: We are blessed by your creativity.\nKAHNU: It’ll be like the old days. And you, Chowdras, shall have the honour of piloting it.\nCHOWDRAS: (DAUNTED) My Prince, Raj Kahnu, you honour me too much.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 58\nKAHNU: (THRILLED) It’s reached seventeen hundred! Dare we try for eighteen, do you think? Yes. Why not!\nSPLUTTERS: REPEATEDLY.\nDEGOOR: My Prince...\nKAHNU: The engine...\nCHOWDRAS: What has happened?\nKAHNU: It’s not responding. Why aren’t you responding! I created you!\nDEGOOR: It’s diving!\nCHOWDRAS: It is heading this way.\nKAHNU: Make it turn. Turn!\nDEGOOR: The outer courts!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: RANI AND CONSTANCE WATCH FROM A WINDOW.\nRANI: What are they doing? The idiots! Who’s controlling that\nRANI: machine?\nCONSTANCE: It doesn’t have a pilot — it’s like a doodlebug!\nRANI: Get down!\nRANI: THE PALACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 60\nDEGOOR: Straight into the Hospital wing!\nCHOWDRAS: Fire dowsing system is operating. Fortunately the place is deserted.\nKAHNU: But the engine — is it intact?\nCHOWDRAS: Difficult to say, Raj Kahnu. We can examine it, but after the impact...\nKAHNU: No. It can’t be destroyed.\nDEGOOR: Repairable surely, my Prince, yes.\nKAHNU: I constructed the engine myself. It can’t be at fault.\nCHOWDRAS: Perhaps a lack of flexibility in the rotor blades.\nKAHNU: No! I cannot be wrong! I shall build it again. I need more materials — metal for the structure and webbing for the wings. I shall start immediately!\nCHOWDRAS: Raj Kahnu, we have limited supplies. It will take time to... [procure. ]\nKAHNU: I want them now!\nCHOWDRAS: Perhaps if you wait, and consider the problem — then the error will become apparent.\nKAHNU: There was no error! Do you question my ability?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 61\nDEGOOR: Highness, we would never dream of that, no. I am sure Minister Chowdras meant no such slight.\nCHOWDRAS: I meant that you are perhaps moving too fast.\nKAHNU: I am a Prince! (FX: ONE OF HIS CLOCKWORK COG-ROACH WHEELS WHIRRS.) I am Raj Kahnu. This is my Palace! But you, Chowdras, whom I considered a friend, you are a traitor!\nCHOWDRAS: Raj Kahnu...\nKAHNU: (BUILDING ANGER) Out! Get out!\nWIND: FLAPS THE TAPESTRIES.\nDEGOOR: Highness...\nKAHNU: I banish you, Chowdras!\nCHOWDRAS: My Prince, if you will only...\nKAHNU: Go now! OUT! OUT!!\nKAHNU: And you, Degoor... (FX: HIS WHEELS WHIRR) My one trusted friend, fetch the materials I need. Bring them to my foundry immediately.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 62\nRANI: How can this world have decayed so fast?\nCONSTANCE: Sorry, but didn’t someone say that it was left in a mess?\nRANI: Another of the Doctor’s feeble attempts to gloat. Jealousy, of\nRANI: course. When did he ever rule his own planet?\nCONSTANCE: It must be very frustrating for you.\nRANI: I ran this world efficiently. There was technological advancement. I saw to that.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANE, HISSING AND CRACKLING.\nRANI: But now look at this place. It’s a ruin. Where is everyone?! How long have I been away?\nCONSTANCE: At least the fire’s out.\nRANI: Who built that flying machine? It’s a toy, but they couldn’t even control it! Is that the best they can do? — Why does no- one come?\nDEGOOR: (DISTANT) Hey! You there!\nCONSTANCE: Look out. Spoke too soon.\nDEGOOR: (APPROACHING) The Palace is forbidden. Who are you?\nRANI: Well, now... (MUTTER) I remember this fool. Let me deal with him.\nDEGOOR: How did you get in?\nRANI: Overseer Degoor, is it not? A great pleasure to meet you, sir. CB Wainwright, Principal of the Bright Time Collegiate on Drusus Luna.\nDEGOOR: You know me? It’s years since I was called that, yes. I ama regal Minister. We are honoured, greatly honoured by your presence... Principal Wainwright.\nRANI: Naturally. And how long is it since your Ruler, the Rani, went away?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 64\nDEGOOR: The Rani! A thousand blessings upon her. It is sixteen years this last triple moon since she left us.\nRANI: (TO HERSELF) Sixteen wasted years.\nDEGOOR: But what interest is that of yours?\nRANI: (ALOUD) My assistant and I have travelled a long way to meet you, Minister Degoor. The Rani herself speaks of you in the highest terms.\nDEGOOR: Have you seen her? And she mentioned me? Did she send you?\nCONSTANCE: Absolutely, she did. Of all the people she mentions, Degoor is seldom far from her thoughts. Degoor this... Degoor that...\nDEGOOR: (FLATTERED) She remembers?\nCONSTANCE: I’m Mrs Clarke, by the way. Her Assistant.\nRANI: (MOMENTARILY SHARP) Thank you... Mrs Clarke. — Minister, this planet seems to be in some disarray. We saw that flying machine crash?\nCONSTANCE: At least no-one was hurt.\nDEGOOR: By good grace, no. It was a trial run.\nRANI: But who rules here now? Some tiresome committee, I suppose — on which of course, you serve selflessly.\nDEGOOR: Not a committee, no. Although yes, I serve - in the humblest capacity, yes. But as you can see, our resources are limited.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 65\nRANI: So perhaps the Rani’s return would restore it to its former glory.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: A WIDE STONE PLAIN.\nDOCTOR WHO: OPENS.\nPAZMI: (INSIDE) You have really brought me home?\nDOCTOR: (INSIDE) See for yourself, Pazmi. (THEY STEP OUT) Is this right? Miasimia Goria?\nPAZMI: (QUIETLY MOVED) The Roof of Trees. Oh.. I never thought I’d see this again.\nDOCTOR: Curious name... Still, I followed the Rani’s coordinates to the digit... apart from that adjustment of my own.\nPAZMI: Your ‘diversion’?\nDOCTOR: A year or so later than she intended. Handing her empire back on a plate would not have been a good idea. Which reminds me... (GOING BACK INSIDE) Back in a moment.\nPAZMI: Oh, Miasimia.. what has she done to you? She won’t get it back, I swear.\nDOCTOR: There we are. (FX: HE SHUTS THE DOOR) It may seem overly dramatic, but I’ve disabled my ship’s drive system. Just because the Rani’s lost her own TARDIS, I don’t want her hightailing it out of here in mine. She’s an unpredictable quantity at the best of times. — What extraordinary formations! Are those trees down there, or stacks of dinner plates?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 67\nPAZMI: They are a remembrance of the great forest that once covered this land.\nDOCTOR: Statues of trees? A whole plain’s worth?\nPAZMI: It was a wild world before. There was harmony...\nDOCTOR: Until the Rani arrived?\nPAZMI: It was already changing. But she made it worse — far worse. We must never forget that. There’s a track along here.\nDOCTOR: And what about you, Pazmi? Still glimpsing the future?\nPAZMI: Not since you pulled me off that feed line.\nDOCTOR: Good. It means a short dose has no lasting effect. — I assume that’s the Rani’s Palace ahead. It seems suitably grandiose. Did she build it herself, or did she just move in?\nPAZMI: She ordered its building. The town grew up around it.\nDOCTOR: And I expect you have a family there?\nPAZMI: (SAD) My family?\nDOCTOR: Although... well, it seems very quiet. I’d expected signs of activity — trade or agriculture — or even industry. Some sign of life.\nPAZMI: I know. That’s worrying me too.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 68\nDEGOOR: My office, Madam. We can speak privately here.\nRANI: Why? Who is listening?\nDEGOOR: And your companion? Is she...\nCONSTANCE: Oh, don’t worry. I’m very discreet. Official Secrets Act and all that.\nRANI: What’s happened here? Where is everyone? You had advancement before — rockets and a space programme. This is a leap backwards.\nKAHNU: (INTERCOM) Degoor? Where are you?\nRANI: Who is that?\nKAHNU: (INTERCOM) Degoor? An attempt was made to access the foundry systems. There are strangers in my Palace.\nRANI: His Palace?\nCONSTANCE: The new ruler? After sixteen years they’d have to find some replacement for the Rani — a thousand blessings upon her.\nRANI: (MUTTER) One more word from you!\nKAHNU: (INTERCOM) Degoor! Where are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 69\nDEGOOR: Please... stand away from the scanner.\nRANI: Degoor, I came here to see you — no-one else.\nDEGOOR: Of course, Madam. (FX: HE CLICKS THE INTERCOM) Raj Kahnu. I am already searching the Palace for the intruders.\nKAHNU: (INTERCOM) I’ve ordered patrols out to search the town.\nDEGOOR: A sensible move, yes, my Prince. Rest assured. They will be found.\nRANI: (DISBELIEF) Raj Kahnu? Who is that?\nDEGOOR: He is our ruler, Madam, yes. The enlightened one.\nCONSTANCE: It sounds, “Principal Wainwright”, as if the Rani has a rival.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 70\nDOCTOR: Still no sign?\nPAZMI: Nothing. The house is deserted. Like the whole town.\nDOCTOR: No-one’s lived here for years, that’s obvious. Maybe they moved away. All of them.\nPAZMI: This is my mother’s house.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you said.\nPAZMI: Everything’s abandoned. They wouldn’t leave all this.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps they had to get out fast. Don’t give up hope. There’s no sign of a struggle. It’s quite tidy — apart from the dust.\nPAZMI: Are you certain we’re only one year out?\nDOCTOR: Well... in the unlikely event that I’m wrong - then so is the Rani.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) What was that?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Something outside.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) Careful!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 71\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Just looking.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) And?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Nothing I can see. (FX: WHIRR, OFF) Ah...\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) High up on the wall. A large insect — man-sized — like\nDOCTOR: a metal-plated cockroach.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) A what? Did it see you?\nDOCTOR: Not indigenous, I take it. Is there a back way out?\nPAZMI: Only through to the yard. There’s no gate.\nDOCTOR: That door won’t hold for long. — Right. Get behind me. I’11l\nDOCTOR: lure it off. You run.\nPAZMI: That’s no good!\nDOCTOR: You have a better idea?\nDOCTOR: ENTERS, ITS SIX FEET SCRABBLING.\nDOCTOR: Well... what a beautiful precision instrument.\nPAZMI: It’s disgusting.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 72\nDOCTOR: It’s fascinating. Exquisite scroll work on the armour.\nPAZMI: Keep back!\nDOCTOR: This was made by a craftsman.\nDOCTOR: OTHER.\nPAZMI: Doctor! Look out!\nBREJESH: Get back!\nPAZMI: (INCREDULOUS) Brejesh?\nBREJESH: Come on then, you roach! Come on...\nDOCTOR: Careful!\nBREJESH: Over here!\nBREJESH: WITH AN EFFORT, BREJESH THROWS A TINKLING METAL NET ACROSS THE SOUNDSCAPE. THE SNARED COG-ROACH WHIRRS AND THRASHES INSIDE.\nDOCTOR: It’s caught!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page\nBREJESH: The metal net tangles their sensors. Come on, get out!\nPAZMI: Brejesh?\nBREJESH: (AMAZED) Pazmi? No, that’s madness... it can’t be. It can’t be you.\nDOCTOR: Can we get out of here please?\nBREJESH: Yes. Yes, I know somewhere safe. This way!\nBREJESH: 73\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 74\nDEGOOR: Principal Wainwright, there is much to discuss.\nRANI: Indeed there is.\nDEGOOR: Things that cannot be said in ‘present company’.\nCONSTANCE: (PEEVED) You want me to go, is that what you’re saying?\nRANI: Wait outside, Mrs Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: I’m not just a dogsbody, you know. I can be useful.\nRANI: Will you go!\nCONSTANCE: Of course. Thank you.\nRANI: And don’t wander off. (FX: DOOR CLOSES) Now Minister, what do you have for me?\nDEGOOR: Just a memento, yes? A small keepsake I’ve had locked away ever Since the Rani — one thousand blessings upon her — left us so suddenly.\nRANI: Ah...\nDEGOOR: You recognise this?\nRANI: Perhaps...\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 75\nDEGOOR: Unfortunately the casket defies all attempts to open it.

All this time, yes. I knew you would return.\nRANI: And here I am.\nDEGOOR: At last. Reborn. Renewed. Welcome home.\nRANI: Who is this Prince? This ‘Raj Kahnu’?\nDEGOOR: He is your successor, yes.\nRANI: My successor? A usurper, you mean?\nDEGOOR: No, Highness. Raj Kahnu is the only survivor of your Great Experiment.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 76\nDOCTOR: Sixteen years! I apologise, Pazmi. I seem to have overshot the mark. Brejesh, we owe you our lives. I’m sorry you lost your net.\nBREJESH: No matter. We’re safe here for the moment. — I still can’t believe it’s you, Pazmi. You’re no different.\nPAZMI: Just angrier. While you... you’ve got... older, Brejesh.\nBREJESH: What did you expect? Oh... come here.\nBREJESH: BEAT.\nDOCTOR: Ahem... You’re old acquaintances, I take it?\nBREJESH: I thought I was the last one left.\nPAZMI: Are they all gone? All the people?\nBREJESH: (GRIM) That’s something I can’t explain. You need to see. I’1l show you tomorrow.\nPAZMI: But that insect creature? What was it?\nDOCTOR: ‘Creature’ may not be the ideal description. It was heavily armoured.

Why would they? After Rani did.\nBREJESH: a one-way mission. I didn’t expect to come back. I kill her. I jumped ship at the Orion Hub and wormed my Galactic Security records.\nBREJESH: led you to Teccaurora Penitentiary - where you fell Rani’s clutches.\nBREJESH: You found her?\nPAZMI: My plan failed. She’s still alive. She’s coming back!\nCHOWDRAS: The Rani\nPAZMI: Chowdras!\nPAZMI: is returning?\nCHOWDRAS: Pazmi, welcome back.\nPAZMI: I never thought... I mean, she may already be here, sir. The Doctor brought me home.\nDOCTOR: We don’t\nCHOWDRAS: know if Rani has arrived. You just need to be ready.\nCHOWDRAS: (ASTONISHED) You are the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 78\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. Have we met before?\nCHOWDRAS: Unfortunately not. But I’ve read all about you.\nDOCTOR: Ah, that sounds ominous.\nCHOWDRAS: An honour to meet you, sir. Anyone who merits the Rani’s hatred is worthy of my untold admiration.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s flattery if you like. You knew her then, in the old days?\nCHOWDRAS: Until this morning, I was tutor to the Prince — his Regal Highness Raj Kahnu — the ruler of Miasimia Goria.\nBREJESH: A thousand curses upon him.\nDOCTOR: Raj Kahnu?\nCHOWDRAS: A lost soul, Doctor, Long since beyond my help. But now some providence has sent you to us. Please. I implore you to save him.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nCONSTANCE: GETTING BORED.\nCONSTANCE: Come on.

What do you want?\nKAHNU: Isn’t that what I should ask you?\nKAHNU: 80\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 81\nRANI: Where is this child prodigy, Degoor? You must have notes... charts of his development.\nDEGOOR: Your Highness. The Prince never sleeps. He is the only subject on your mental expansion project to develop heightened abilities.\nRANI: Only one?\nDEGOOR: One out of the entire population, yes.\nDEGOOR: BEAT.\nRANI: One is enough.\nDEGOOR: But so many are lost.\nRANI: Yet one succeeded! Can you imagine a world filled with hundreds of new born Gods — all demanding attention?\nRANI: How is he? What intelligence ratio has he reached?\nDEGOOR: We are constantly amazed at his creative dexterity. But he is... demanding... exhausting.\nRANI: Of course, he’s demanding. He’s a genius! Was it him? Did he learn to lock me out of my own systems?\nDEGOOR: He controls everything, Highness.\nRANI: (AMUSED) You see? Even without my guidance, he has surpassed the potential I planned for!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 82\nDEGOOR: Highness. I fear, yes, that he may not be what you expect.\nRANI: Why? What’s the matter with him? Is he ill?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 83\nCHOWDRAS: There was no town before the Rani came and built the Palace. We were fieldsmen and wanderers.\nPAZMI: She soon changed all that.\nCHOWDRAS: She created the middling castes. And industry and greed.\nBREJESH: There’s food here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Brejesh.\nCHOWDRAS: The Rani planned to increase ‘universal mental awareness’. She called it psychic energiser treatment.. her ‘Great Experiment...’\nPAZMI: Her New Dawn... which she inflicted on most of the Gorian populace.\nDOCTOR: Yet you three survived.\nCHOWDRAS: I was in her retinue. I was exempt.\nBREJESH: Chowdras sheltered Pazmi and I from the scourge waves as they rolled across the surface.\nCHOWDRAS: At first, no-one could sleep.\nDOCTOR: (FOREBODING) Ah yes. The “Nessun Dorma” syndrome.\nCHOWDRAS: And then the riots started.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 84\nBREJESH: People’s minds were crushed... emptied. The treatment she used was cruel and misjudged.\nDOCTOR: She got it wrong.\nPAZMI: That was the day the world died. It snowed ash. And the Rani fled, leaving us in the devastation.\nDOCTOR: And Raj Kahnu?\nCHOWDRAS: The one success... what she aimed for. Even as an infant, his mind grew extravagantly. He never sleeps or tires. He runs us in TAngs:.\nDOCTOR: You must be exhausted.\nCHOWDRAS: I have no idea what his limits are. Certainly more than this world can provide for. But with your help...\nDOCTOR: Me!\nCHOWDRAS: The Prince needs someone who matches his intellect — who can give him fresh opportunities.\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, no. No, no, no.\nCHOWDRAS: Doctor, if the Rani claims him first? What then?\nDOCTOR: That is moral blackmail! (BEAT; SIGHS) I will meet him, if that’s what you want. But I am not ferrying him round the Universe in my TARDIS. I’m not a tour guide. Or a nanny! That’s your problem!\nBREJESH: Pazmi, I was wrong. It can’t wait. You have to see our darkest sorrow now.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: 42[A]. INT. RECEIVING ROOM\nKAHNU: You’re not Miasimian? You’re not even Gorian — you don’t smell of our world. You smell of ‘Elsewhere’.\nCONSTANCE: Please, can we have some light? I can’t see a thing— (FX: SHE COLLIDES WITH A TABLE) Ow!\nKAHNU: Other worlds are just ideas to me. But I want to see them, and explore them.\nCONSTANCE: Sorry, I’m lost. I don’t know my way home.\nKAHNU: (IRRITATED) Well, what good is that!\nCONSTANCE: At least I don’t live on the ceiling! (FX: SHE WALKS INTO\nANOTHER: CHAIR) Ah! Where’s the door?\nKAHNU: I can only imagine other worlds — and that’s worse. (FX: HE\nSCUTTLES: CLOSER) I can’t control that! But you could tell me!\nCONSTANCE: (CONFUSED) You want me to tell you a story? Is that it?\nKAHNU: No, facts. I want facts! Not stories! It has to be precise. That’s what my ‘mm-mother’ said. (HE STRUGGLES WITH THE WORD\nMOTHER: )\nCONSTANCE: Well, I’m sure she knows best.\nKAHNU: I’ve read her notes. Her ‘legacy’. (ANGRY) And that’s my world. My ‘inheritance’!\nCONSTANCE: Is she no longer alive? What was her name?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 86\nKAHNU: Don’t question me! She went away. Or she’s dead. I don’t know. She’s my mm-mother, not yours! (DEFENSIVE) I am trying to rebuild what she got wrong! — Unless... (SUDDEN THOUGHT) she sent you.\nKAHNU: AWAY.\nCONSTANCE: Please... keep away from me.\nKAHNU: Did she? Is that why you’re here? Is she still alive?\nCONSTANCE: Does she call herself the Rani?!\nKAHNU: Ah!\nCONSTANCE: Is that who you mean?\nKAHNU: Have you seen her? Did she send you to spy on me?!\nCONSTANCE: Are these shutters? Because I’m not standing here in the dark!\nKAHNU: No! Don’t touch. Leave them!\nKAHNU: Now you see me. This is what she made me!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 87\nCONSTANCE: You’re a cockroach!

A giant metal cockroach!\nKAHNU: Raj Kahnu - the child of the Rani!\nKAHNU: SCENE CONTINUES:\nKAHNU: 42[B]. INT. RECEIVING ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nCONSTANCE: (QUIETLY TERRIFIED) I’m sorry. I didn’t know. How could I? Is it painful?\nKAHNU: Sometimes. But the mechanisms are self-winding. (FX: HE WHIRRS) They cope with the bodily functions. It’s my thoughts that keep me alive, though.\nCONSTANCE: And the Rani put you in this... machine?\nKAHNU: Go and tell her. Say I built and armoured the suit myself. Like a scuttling roach, because they go up and down and everywhere I could not. And I couldn’t stay in the cot where she left me forever!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 89\nBREJESH: No-one ahead. Along here. Then down to the Roof.\nCHOWDRAS: Doctor, please reconsider.\nDOCTOR: I’ve told you, Chowdras. I have to find my friend.\nCHOWDRAS: You are condemning the Prince — and us — to eternal misery. If the Rani returns...\nPAZMI: She has returned.\nDOCTOR: We don’t know that, Pazmi!\nPAZMI: The Rani dragged Constance with her. That’s why you followed.\nDOCTOR: And she might not have arrived yet — if she ever does.\nBREJESH: (SOTTO) Wait! Back!\nBREJESH: OUT OF SIGHT.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) What’s happened?\nBREJESH: (SOTTO) Roaches. Heading up the street.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Can we get out?\nBREJESH: (SOTTO) The side bridge. Come on. We can double back out on to the Roof.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 90\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Over the roof? Isn’t that rather precarious?\nPAZMI: The Roof of Trees, Doctor.\nCHOWDRAS: Where hides our darkest secret of all.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 91\nRANI: Where’s the Clarke woman? I told her to wait!\nDEGOOR: I’1ll have the Palace searched immediately, Highness.\nRANI: While I see Raj Kahnu. Where is he?\nDEGOOR: Highness, this is not wise. He is the Prince here. He may not\nDEGOOR: take the news of your sudden return well.\nRANI: Then he must learn! Take me to him now!\nRANI: (STARTLED) Ah! Degoor.. What is that? That ‘creature’?\nDEGOOR: No, don’t shoot! It’s one of Kahnu’s retinue.\nRANI: His ‘staff’!? (ANGRY) What is he doing, Degoor? What have you let him do?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 92\nKAHNU: The Rani gave me a superior mind, but not a body to match.\nKAHNU: I saw her once. She looked in at me over my cot wall. One look from those eyes was like being stabbed. I don’t think she spoke. She made notes and then moved onto the cot next to mine.\nCONSTANCE: You remember her from when you were so little?\nKAHNU: The first thing I knew was my cot — its walls were the limit of my world.\nCONSTANCE: I remember my first home too, in the African bush. Don’t go beyond the fence, they said. But I didn’t listen. Now I’m half the sky away.\nKAHNU: Then they moved me away from the others, and gave me a bigger bed — but I still only saw what they allowed me to see.\nCONSTANCE: (LOST IN REMEMBRANCE) Father was determined to have a lawn, just like in England - but the warthogs kept digging it up.\nKAHNU: I knew there was another world outside — through the door where the orderlies went. (GROWING DISTRESSED) I could hear laughing and screams. And gunfire. There was lots of smoke. (HE CRIES\nOUT: — A LONG THIN WAIL OF DESPAIR)\nCONSTANCE: You’re making that happen, aren’t you? (SOOTHING) Please, your highness. Calm yourself.\nKAHNU: (REGAINING COMPOSURE) I think... they were scared of me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 93\nCONSTANCE: Yes, I can see why.\nKAHNU: So I drew them a new bed that walked. I made them build it to my plans. And then another. And another. Until I had this! Now I scuttle where I please.\nCONSTANCE: Like a squander bug, yes.\nKAHNU: No. I’m a bedbug. Always was. (FX: HIS WHEELS WIND) You can tell Her that too. If you see her. — Was that your story? About\nKAHNU: your Father? I didn’t understand it. What world was that?\nKAHNU: OPPOSITE.\nCONSTANCE: (STARTLED) Ah! — There are other roaches. More like you.\nKAHNU: They’re my servants and soldiers. They only have one thought — to tend to my needs and follow my orders.\nDEGOOR: My Prince. — Forgive me, I see you have company already.\nKAHNU: What is it, Degoor?\nDEGOOR: Another visitor, from a distant world, craves an audience.\nKAHNU: Yes?\nDEGOOR: May I present Principal Wainwright, of the Bright Time Collegiate on Drusus Luna.\nRANI: (SWEEPING IN) Your Regal Highness, (SHOCKED AT THE SIGHT OF HIS COG-ROACH FORM) Raj... Kahnu...\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 94\nKAHNU: Principal Wainwright.\nRANI: It is.. an honour to meet you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: THE FUGITIVES CLAMBER ACROSS THE PLAIN.\nPAZMI: (MUTTER) No sign of the roaches following. How much further?\nBREJESH: You’11 know when we get there.\nDOCTOR: Here, Chowdras. It’s steep here. Lean on me!\nCHOWDRAS: Uh, my back... thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, your plain of stone trees still looks like an earthquake\nDOCTOR: in a dinner plate factory to me.\nPAZMI: Doctor, don’t wander off the path.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nBREJESH: The roof’s thin. It can give way under you.\nDOCTOR: But the roof of what? What exactly is below us?\nCHOWDRAS: This is the roof of trees. The stone forest.\nPAZMI: You’re only seeing the crowns up here. The trees go down another five hundred spans beneath us.\nDOCTOR: We’re walking on the canopy of a stone forest? Is that what mean?\nDOCTOR: you\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 96\nCHOWDRAS: One of the wonders of Miasimia.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes. Impressive. Mightily so. Is that what you wanted to show me?\nBREJESH: You’1ll see. Further on.\nCHOWDRAS: For what little good it’1l do.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Chowdras. This is because of me, isn’t it?\nCHOWDRAS: Why should you worry, Doctor? It isn’t your world? And you can leave any time you wish.\nDOCTOR: It’s still my universe.\nCHOWDRAS: Whilst I must crawl back to the Palace, begging Raj Kahnu for mercy. He’1ll soon forget he’s banished me. His rages never last.\nDOCTOR: You’re sure of that?\nCHOWDRAS: No. But what else can I do?\nDOCTOR: You know, we have much in common, you and I.\nCHOWDRAS: I doubt that.\nDOCTOR: Enquiring minds, a belief in freedom and an enemy in the Rani. We can see her off between us, don’t you think? And with your local knowledge...\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nCHOWDRAS: I thought you were leaving. But yes. cause.

Back there.\nBREJESH: A roach? They don’t normally come out of town. Unless it’s picked up our trail.\nPAZMI: Can’t see it now. Only one, I think.\nBREJESH: But it can soon attract more.\nPAZMI: So what do we do?\nBREJESH: Time we went below.\nDOCTOR: You realise something’s following us?\nPAZMI: We'd noticed.\nBREJESH: Head for that tree. There’1ll be a way down.\nDOCTOR: Down! Now I am intrigued. (CALLS) Chowdras! Over there — to the tree!\nCHOWDRAS: (OFF) Brejesh! — There’s something moving beneath me! On the underside! I saw it through a crack.\nBREJESH: Don’t move!\nBREJESH: TO CHOWDRAS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 99\nBREJESH: (ENFORCED CALM) Now... walk slowly towards me.\nCHOWDRAS: It may have been following us... underneath.\nDOCTOR: There! I saw its antennae.\nPAZMI: It’s just below him.\nBREJESH: And another step.\nCHOWDRAS: (UNSTEADY) It’s dark down there. No wonder things vanish.\nPAZMI: Careful.\nBREJESH: Step back, go back.\nPAZMI: And another.\nDOCTOR: Chowdras... step back now... slowly! It’s directly under you.\nCHOWDRAS: I can see it. It’s a roach.\nPAZMI: The roof’s giving way! Move back!\nCHOWDRAS: itm trying?\nDOCTOR: Chowdras! Step... sideways.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nPAZMI: Look out!\nBREJESH: It’s got him!\nPAZMI: It’s pulling him down!\nCHOWDRAS: Help me!\nDOCTOR: Hang on! Grab my arm!\nBREJESH: The roof! It’s crumbling!\nPAZMI: Chowdras!\nDOCTOR: Stay back! He’s gone.\nPAZMI: He can’t have! He can’t!\nDOCTOR: A FIERCE HISS.\nDOCTOR: The roach went with him. I’m sorry. Come away.\nBREJESH: Pazmi. Come away.\nBREJESH: Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 101\nPAZMI: He can’t have!\nBREJESH: Come on. Head for the tree.\nPAZMI: He can’t be gone!\nDOCTOR: Come on, Pazmi. We can’t stay here.\nPAZMI: What hope do we have now?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 102\nRANI: Raj Kahnu, your name already resonates through the learning houses of the outer systems. There is great interest in your work.\nKAHNU: In me! How can that be possible? We receive few visitors. How can they know of me?\nRANI: There are those who observe Miasimia Goria from afar. That’s why I came to see this phenomenon for myself.\nKAHNU: Then I, in turn, am honoured. But forgive me... (CALLS) Bring refreshment for our guests.\nRANI: I see you have met my assistant already. She should have waited.\nCONSTANCE: I was waiting, ‘Madam Principal’, as you instructed me.\nKAHNU: And I invited her in. I enjoyed our discourse. I can learn much from her. I already have.\nRANI: Indeed?\nCONSTANCE: Your Highness is very kind.\nKAHNU: This world was taken to the brink of destruction. It is still in shock. But, I believe, it is in my power to restore its former order. To make it greater than ever.\nRANI: I should like to see your progress myself. The ‘Collegiate’ would like to offer assistance to you... and your world.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 103\nKAHNU: Your generosity would be most gracious.\nRANI: I note that you have a flight programme underway.\nKAHNU: Oh, that. Not everything meets the efficiency I expect. (POINTEDLY) Sometimes things disappoint. I have many other schemes.\nKAHNU: Here’s refreshment. Please help yourself.\nCONSTANCE: Thank you, your Highness.\nKAHNU: No! Idiot!\nKAHNU: Decent food for guests. Not roach pickings! Fetch more!\nKAHNU: I apologise. They are... inadequate.\nRANI: On the contrary, Highness, they are remarkable. Their armoured insect suits are an astonishing feat of engineering. I see that like yourself, they have operators inside. Is that an enhancement?\nKAHNU: (ANNOYED) It is a necessity. Their minds were rendered dull by the cruel disaster that befell our world.\nRANI: But your recovery is extraordinary.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 104\nKAHNU: Yes, it is. We were left in despair! Crippled!\nKAHNU: But I am creating, as best I can, a new world for these wretched, ruined people! Their minds are broken. But at least they don’t leave me or abandon me. Not like you did... Mother!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 105\nGRAVELLY: BASE OF THE STONE TREE.\nBREJESH: Round here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Brejesh, I still can’t tell. This tree, is it a fossil ora sculpture?\nBREJESH: Take a look inside.\nDOCTOR: Through here? (HE LEANS INSIDE THE TREE. HIS VOICE GOES BOXY) Oh... It’s hollowed out. There’s a staircase heading down.\nPAZMI: We’re going down there? Into the lower deeps?\nBREJESH: We have to.\nDOCTOR: (INSIDE) Hang on. I’ve a torch somewhere.\nPAZMI: When we were young we were told never to go deep, ever.\nBREJESH: You’re still young.\nPAZMI: I’ve been left behind. My family... Chowdras... all gone.\nDOCTOR: (RE-EMERGING ) There may be good reasons to avoid the depths. They could be crawling with roaches.\nBREJESH: Nowhere’s safe — not anymore. But you must see what’s down there. (BEAT) Pazmi?\nPAZMI: (SIGHS) Alright. The deeps. Let’s keep moving.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 106\nRANI: I am not your ‘Mother’.\nKAHNU: You created me.\nRANI: You are the product of a scientific exercise, that is all.\nKAHNU: (COLDLY ANGRY) Constance, tell your mistress ‘The Rani’ — she can change her appearance all she likes, but her eyes are still as cold and hard as the first time I saw her.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sure she can hear you.\nRANI: He despises me, of course.\nKAHNU: You expected less?\nRANI: I left Miasimia to find a remedy for the fault in the experiment. It was inefficient.\nKAHNU: It was your fault. People died... worse than died.\nCONSTANCE: What does that mean?\nRANI: There were circumstances beyond my control. I could not return.\nKAHNU: (FURIOUS) We had circumstances too! This was never your world!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 107\nKAHNU: You are neither Miasimian nor Gorian!\nCONSTANCE: Your Highness! No! Raj Kahnu!\nRANI: You’re making this happen!\nKAHNU: (COLD HATRED) You are not welcome!\nRANI: (GASPS, RESISTING KAHNU’S POWERS) I... gave you your power!\nKAHNU: Get out! Out!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: THE STORM INSIDE FADES AS THE DOOR SHUTS.\nDEGOOR: Your Highness. Did he harm you? He has such rages. Each day we live in fear for our lives. — Come away now. You cannot stay here.\nRANI: (QUIETLY THRILLED) Oh, Degoor. He has greater power than I dared imagine. Now all I need do is harness it.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 109\nKAHNU: (SCUTTLING BACK AND FORTH) (DISTURBED) She came here to mock. I know she did. She came to\nKAHNU: destroy me!\nCONSTANCE: Highness, listen to me.\nKAHNU: And you came with her. You’re on her side!\nCONSTANCE: No! That’s the last thing I am!\nKAHNU: How do I know?! She wants it all back! She’1l destroy us all!\nCONSTANCE: Be quiet!\nCONSTANCE: BEAT.\nCONSTANCE: It’s only ever about you, isn’t it? You should hear yourself! You’1l never get the better of her like that. I wanted to help you... but if you’re not interested, I’1ll go now. (BEAT) Goodbye, your Regal Highness. I’1l find something better to do.\nKAHNU: Stop her!\nCONSTANCE: What are you doing?\nCONSTANCE: Get out of my way!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 110\nKAHNU: (CALMER) You can’t go, Constance. I won’t let you. You are needed. We all have our duties to perform.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 111\nPAZMI: How much further?\nDOCTOR: We've descended seven hundred and fifty steps so far. More than the Eiffel Tower.\nPAZMI: The what?\nDOCTOR: It’s the thought of walking back up that worries me. I assume none of these trees have lifts.\nBREJESH: How likely is that?\nDOCTOR: Just a second. There’s an opening in the wall here. Pass me the torch, Pazmi.\nPAZMI: Here.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see. Ah...\nBREJESH: What is it?\nDOCTOR: You like statues round here, don’t you? Ever been to Florence? No, silly question. Here, take a look. There’s a whole crowd of them down there.\nPAZMI: There are hundreds. Where did they come from?\nBREJESH: They’re to remind us. In remembrance of what we’ve lost.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nDOCTOR: They’re not statues at all, are they?\nBREJESH: No, Doctor. They’re not.\nBREJESH: Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 113\nDEGOOR: This way, Highness.\nRANI: I need to stay in the Palace. Once we reach the North Wing...\nDEGOOR: It’s not safe. Raj Kahnu will have the building searched for you.\nRANI: So now I’m a fugitive in my own city.. what’s left of it.\nDEGOOR: Along here. Follow me.\nRANI: I shall control him. He’1ll soon come crawling to heel.\nDEGOOR: Is that possible?\nRANI: Where are the others? Are they dead too?\nDEGOOR: The others?\nRANI: The other fawning ministers in my Council.\nDEGOOR: They are all gone, Highness, yes.\nRANI: If you mean they’re dead, why don’t you say so?\nDEGOOR: It is.. not as easy as that. Death was taken away from us. Come and I’1l show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nDOCTOR WHO: A VAST CAVERN, NOT MUCH ECHO UNLESS YOU SHOUT. IT’S THRONGED BY A HOST OF STATUESQUE FIGURES.\nPAZMI: (QUIETLY APPALLED) The statues, they’re people!\nDOCTOR: Just about. Try not to touch them.\nPAZMI: So many of them. So old-looking.\nDOCTOR: Ragged... emaciated... unmoving.\nBREJESH: Now you understand why I brought you here.\nDOCTOR: They’re in an almost vegetative state. This one flicker of a pulse.\nPAZMI: They’re hiding, aren’t they?\nBREJESH: From the Rani, Raj Kahnu.. and the world they’ve\nDOCTOR: Page 114\nDOCTOR: They’re alive!\nDOCTOR: has barely the\nDOCTOR: lost.\nDOCTOR: Don’t wander off. It would be easy to get lost amongst them.\nPAZMI: But how can they survive?\nBREJESH: After the Rani fled...\nPAZMI: When she abandoned the world.\nBREJESH: . and the violence and riots subsided. People went into a sort of torpor — just wandering aimlessly... until they gathered down\nBREJESH: here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 115\nDOCTOR: All too familiar, I’m afraid. These symptoms are caused by exposure to an artificial bacteria called the Ablative. It was created by a young fool who should have known better. And refined to its medicinal level by the Rani.\nPAZMI: (GASPS) No...\nBREJESH: Pazmi?\nPAZMI: (IN SHOCK) Look... look at him. The Rani did this. It’s Tamoon. It’s my brother.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 116\nCONSTANCE: How many rooms in the Palace?\nKAHNU: Is that something I should consider? It hardly seems important.\nCONSTANCE: Just making conversation. Or trying to.\nKAHNU: How much do you sleep?\nCONSTANCE: Never enough. (FX: THEY STOP) Is this it?\nKAHNU: The entrance to the North Wing.\nKAHNU: This is the heart of my domain.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: COG-ROACHES SCUTTLE. WHEELS TURN. A DISTANT STEAM HAMMER POUNDS.\nKAHNU: My foundry. These are the workshops from where I rebuild my broken world.\nCONSTANCE: It’s like a munitions factory.\nKAHNU: For making weapons?\nCONSTANCE: For the war effort. Keeping mum and digging for victory. Seems so far away now.\nKAHNU: So you fight?\nCONSTANCE: Well, one has to make a stand, sometimes.\nKAHNU: Look out!\nCONSTANCE: Ow!\nKAHNU: Are you hurt? Constance?\nCONSTANCE: (IN PAIN) My arm.. ow! No. Just a spark. It caught me. I’1l be fine.\nKAHNU: You should not go unprotected.\nCONSTANCE: I’m fine... really.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 118\nKAHNU: Even so.\nCONSTANCE: I don’t suppose you have a bandage? — No, never mind. I can wrap a hanky round it.\nKAHNU: You are taller than my people.\nCONSTANCE: (MYSTIFIED) Just different, that’s all.\nKAHNU: And the first person to listen to me. (REGRET) Apart from Chowdras.\nCONSTANCE: Have I met him... or her?\nKAHNU: I sent him away. He argued too much.\nCONSTANCE: (WORRIED) Oh, dear.\nKAHNU: I won’t let that happen again. Don’t worry, Constance. I shall\nKAHNU: protect you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 119\nPAZMI: (STUNNED) Tamoon was my younger brother. Now he’s older than me. Oh, so old.\nBREJESH: Sorry, Pazmi.\nPAZMI: The others must be here. Somewhere. My sisters, and my father...\nBREJESH: Wait, Pazmi!\nDOCTOR: I will try to resolve this, Brejesh, I promise you.\nBREJESH: I found my brother, too. I come down and talk to him sometimes. But I don’t know if he hears me.\nDOCTOR: Do they ever move at all?\nBREJESH: Oh, yes. Just don’t be caught when it happens.\nDOCTOR: But what starts it off?\nPAZMI: (SHORT WAY OFF) Brejesh!\nBREJESH: What is it?\nPAZMI: Look at this one.\nDOCTOR: Ah... He’s contorted, poor fellow. As if he’s in agony.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nBREJESH: And he’s aware.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps some victims are less prone to the Ablative than\nDOCTOR: others.\nPAZMI: Something’s coming.\nBREJESH: (SOTTO) A roach! Don’t move.\nBREJESH: (WHISPER) Don’t move, either of you!\nBREJESH: THEN IT SCUTTLES THE OTHER. IT COMES CLOSE. TIC, TIC, TIC, TIC, TIC GO ITS ANTENNAE.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) It’s searching.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Quiet.\nCONTORTED: MAN.\nPAZMI: (SOTTO) It’s taking him. Scooping him up.\nPAZMI: BEAT.\nBREJESH: (TERRIFIED) I thought it had us there.\nDOCTOR: Page 120\nDOCTOR: It took the man who was in pain. As if it knew. Where was it\nDOCTOR: going with him, do you think?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 121\nPAZMI: What was that?\nZOMBIE: MOANING AND GROANING. JUST LOTS OF SOFT OUTWARD BREATHS\nFROM: MANY PEOPLE.\nDOCTOR: They’re coming to life!\nBREJESH: (URGENT) Move. Move now!\nPAZMI: Brejesh, what’s happening?\nBREJESH: Come on. Back to the tree. It’s feeding time!\nBREJESH: Pazmi! Stick by me! You’1l get trampled!\nPAZMI: (MOVING AWAY) They’re shoving me! I can’t see you! Where are you? Brejesh!\nBREJESH: (MOVING AWAY) Over here!\nDOCTOR: (MOVING THE OPPOSITE WAY) (STRUGGLING) No, over here! Come back!\nBREJESH: (DISTANT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) I can’t see you!\nPAZMI: (FURTHER STILL) Doctor, where are you? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (CLOSER AGAIN) Pazmi! Brejesh! I’m losing you!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 122\nRANI: (OFF) Doctor! — Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: What? — Rani! It’s you!\nRANI: Take my hand!\nDOCTOR: Ah! Ah... got it. (HE IS HAULED EFFORTFULLY OUT) Ooh, thank you... I think.\nRANI: In trouble as usual, Doctor? Welcome to my world. I thought you’d never get here!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: IN THE FOREGROUND, RAJ KAHNU SLICES A SHEET OF METAL WITH A LATHE.\nKAHNU: This is going well.\nCONSTANCE: You never stop, do you? What are you making now?\nKAHNU: Fresh armour. A new design.\nKAHNU: Tell me about your war on Earth. Are you a soldier?\nCONSTANCE: It’s not ‘my’ war. And it’s not a good thing. It’s a necessity... and a duty... your Highness.\nKAHNU: Then why did you leave?\nCONSTANCE: My husband went missing. He might be in trouble. Our Intelligence service was ready to haul me in, but the Doctor gave me a chance to get away.\nKAHNU: The ‘Doctor’?\nCONSTANCE: It sounds barmy, but... he travels through time. Ohh, what does it matter, I’ve lost him already!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 124\nKAHNU: The Doctor. I’ve seen his name. It’s in the files that the Rani left behind. They shared the same tutor in their academy days.\nCONSTANCE: Yes, that’s right!\nKAHNU: According to her, the Doctor is an infuriating fool. They are\nKAHNU: bitter enemies. I always wanted to meet him.\nCONSTANCE: Could I see?\nKAHNU: When this is finished. Do you prefer a silver or platinum outer\nKAHNU: shell?\nCONSTANCE: (UNNERVED) What are you doing?\nKAHNU: (IRRITATED) It’s a simple question. Choose the outer shell. I\nKAHNU: don’t want you hurt again.\nCONSTANCE: You’re making armour for me?\nKAHNU: I shall engrave it with designs to mark your higher intellect.\nCONSTANCE: But I don’t want that. Not ever!\nCONSTANCE: BEAT.\nKAHNU: Yes? What’s this? Another recruit up from the deeps?\nKAHNU: That’s good. Prepare him at once. Make sure you remove the\nKAHNU: receptors.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 125\nCONSTANCE: That man it was carrying. He was hurt.\nKAHNU: He’s showing signs of recovery. An armoured shell is the best protection. If war is coming, my forces need building up.\nKAHNU: (TO ROACHES) Cladding detail! Prepare this recruit.\nCONSTANCE: W-what are they doing? No!\nKAHNU: You’1l be much safer.\nCONSTANCE: (SHOCKED) Keep away from me! No!\nCONSTANCE: (STRUGGLING) Let me go!\nKAHNU: Don’t struggle. It will only hurt for a moment.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 126\nAWAY: BELOW US.\nDOCTOR: Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Rani. Your disgusting plans are in ruins. Where’s my friend, Constance?\nRANI: Coping on her own, I imagine. She’s determined enough.\nDOCTOR: Oh.. had a little contretemps, have we? It’s my fault. I neglected you for far too long.\nRANI: You still managed to disrupt my scheduled return.\nDOCTOR: I don’t imagine they were planning a parade. (BEAT) You never allow room for error, do you? No wonder it always goes wrong... and innocents suffer.\nRANI: I could have put it right!\nDOCTOR: “Oh, poor me. I was only acting with the best of intentions?” Your escape cost the lives of nine hundred prisoners!\nRANI: They were convicted criminals - far from innocent. Besides, my experiment here has resulted in one remarkable success. Thanks to my skills - and your ‘Ablative’, the potential of Raj Kahnu’s mind is extraordinary.\nDOCTOR: But what about all those unfortunates below? Their minds damaged, hiding in caves. I’ve never seen such wanton, arrogant cruelty. — Does your protégé know you’re back, by the way? I bet he’s delighted.\nRANI: He knows.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 127\nDOCTOR: I assume it was he who arranged for these poor souls to be fed regularly? Dear, oh dear. Not your style at all. He seems to be showing compassion. Let’s hope he doesn’t turn against you.\nRANI: The crowds have gone. Come on.\nDEGOOR: (APPROACHING) Your Royal Highness? Are you well?\nRANI: Ah! Degoor! There you are.\nDOCTOR: Who’s this? Is his gun really necessary?\nRANI: (TO DEGOOR) The Doctor will be accompanying us back to the Palace. — Bring him now!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 128\nCONSTANCE: IS INSIDE A ROACHSUIT. HER VOICE IS DISTORTED, TINNY.\nKAHNU: (GENTLY) Constance? Constance? Try moving your legs.\nCONSTANCE: (D) (SHOCKED) Ugh... ugh...\nKAHNU: That’s good. You’re learning it already.\nCONSTANCE: (D) I didn’t want this.\nKAHNU: Constance, the Doctor is here.\nCONSTANCE: (D) The Doctor? You’re sure? (FX: HER LEGS SCRABBLE) Where is he?!\nKAHNU: Here, in the Palace... approaching the North Wing. And the Rani is with him.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Let me out of here!\nKAHNU: As my new envoy, you must go and meet them. Go and welcome them to my Palace.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: 62[A]. INT. CORRIDOR TO NORTH WING\nDOCTOR: This is absurd... all these statues. Talk about delusions of\nDOCTOR: grandeur. Is this a palace or a temple?\nRANI: I can’t help it if my subjects want to honour me.\nDOCTOR: Worship, more like. Then, come the revolution, all your statues get toppled. Just like poor old Akhenaten... wiped from history.\nDEGOOR: Highness, Raj Kahnu has occupied the North Wing for the past\nDEGOOR: ten years.\nRANI: What? Impossible!\nDEGOOR: He converted it into workshops.\nDOCTOR: Is that the entrance? Not very grand, is it?\nRANI: Apparently, we are expected.\nDOCTOR: That cog-roach guard seems very unsteady on its feet.\nRANI: Give me your gun, Degoor.\nDEGOOR: Highness.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: OF KILTER.\nCONSTANCE: (DISTORTED, TINNY) Doctor, help me...\nRANI: Tell Raj Kahnu, the Rani is here.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Please... help me!\nRANI: Let us pass. No closer... or I shoot!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Help me, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION; TO RANI) No, wait!\nRANI: (TO CONSTANCE) I said, no closer!\nDOCTOR: Rani, no!\nCONSTANCE: (D)\nCONSTANCE: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 131"

No closer... or I shoot!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Help me, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION; TO RANI) No, wait!\nRANT: (TO CONSTANCE) I said, no closer!\nDOCTOR: Rani, no!\nCONSTANCE: (D)\nCONSTANCE: SCENE CONTINUES:\nCONSTANCE: 62[B]. INT. CORRIDOR TO NORTH WING [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Idiot! That’s Mrs Clarke in there! That’s Constance!\nDOCTOR: Constance! Are you hurt?\nCONSTANCE: (DISTORTED) Stay back! I can’t control this thing!\nDOCTOR: Try to stay calm!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 132\nRANI: More of them!\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take that gun... (SNATCHES AWAY HER GUN) Thank you very much.\nRANI: You’1l get us killed.\nCONSTANCE: (D) It’s fine. I’m fine. I’m getting used to this.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Whoa!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Sorry. Sorry. Back under control.\nRANI: (MUTTER) Degoor? Are you ready?\nDEGOOR: (MUTTER) It’s all prepared, Highness, yes. The transmitters await your signal.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Raj Kahnu! Are you watching? I am the Doctor, and I demand that my friend, Constance, is removed from this contraption!\nRANI: Your Highness, ignore this fool’s lack of manners. We wish to speak with you.\nRANI: BEAT.\nKAHNU: (ON TANNOY) You tried to shoot her, mm-Mother!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 133\nDOCTOR: Mother! Oho, now I’ve finally heard everything!\nRANI: We thought she was attacking us!\nKAHNU: (TANNOY) She’s my friend too!\nDOCTOR: Then release her. First rule of diplomacy, your Highness. Don’t send inexperienced messengers. Do the job yourself.\nKAHNU: (TANNOY ) Doctor, you are most welcome to my foundry. Please enter.\nRANI: About time.\nKAHNU: (TANNOY) Not you, Mother.\nRANI: What!\nKAHNU: (TANNOY) I don’t want to listen to you.\nRANI: I will be admitted. What are you doing in there?!\nDOCTOR: Your Highness. You can’t ignore her.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Raj Kahnu? She’s safer where you can see her. Let her in.\nRANI: I promise I mean you no harm... your Regal Highness.\nRANI: BEAT.\nKAHNU: (TANNOY) Come in then. If you must.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Thank you, sir. (MUTTER) Don’t worry, Mrs Clarke. I’1l have you out of that as soon as possible.\nRANI: Out of my way.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 135\nRANI: (MUTTER) Incredible. What has he done?\nDOCTOR: Good grief.\nCONSTANCE: (D) These are Raj Kahnu’s workshops.\nRANI: (MUTTER) It’ll take years to undo the damage.\nDOCTOR: I thought as much. Rani, you slyboots, this Palace’s ‘North Wing’ is a late addition, is it not? In fact, unlike any other Miasimian architecture, it’s bigger inside than out.\nCONSTANCE: (D) It’s like the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Not ‘like’ — it is a TARDIS. A second TARDIS!\nRANI: And why not? Only the sermonising dullards amongst us would limit themselves to one ship!\nDOCTOR: Some of us don’t feel the need for two!\nRANI: See what I mean?\nCONSTANCE: (D) But it’s so different. Cavernous. Not like your TARDIS at all.\nDOCTOR: Raj Kahnu has obviously reconfigured the interior. I assume you disabled the drive system, Rani. If there’s a youngster involved, the last thing you do is leave the car keys lying about.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 136\nRANI: Of course I have.\nDOCTOR: Right. Come on, Mrs Clarke. Let’s get you out of this armoured perambulator, before you start getting attached to it.\nKAHNU: Leave Constance as she is.\nDOCTOR: What? Who said that?\nCONSTANCE: (D) He’s above you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah... Raj Kahnu, I presume. I didn’t see you hiding up there.\nKAHNU: Constance is my envoy — under my protection.\nDOCTOR: Is that what you call it? Doesn’t she have a say in the matter?\nCONSTANCE: (D) Doctor, be careful.\nDOCTOR: We’re only visiting your world. You can’t make her stay. Now, how does this armour open up?\nKAHNU: Leave her! Leave her alone!\nGASPS: FOR BREATH.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Your Highness! Please! Let him go! I promise to stay! I promise!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 137\nKAHNU: Agreed. And I release you also, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: (VOICE NORMAL) (EXHAUSTED) Your Highness. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS) Thank you... Raj Kahnu. Come on, come.\nCONSTANCE: Ow.. pins and needles, ooh.\nDOCTOR: Constance. Out you\nDOCTOR: I’m not surprised. You’ll need a rest after what our young\nDOCTOR: Prince put you through.\nCONSTANCE: He didn’t mean it. He doesn’t understand.\nRANI: (QUIETLY) Quite a temper, hasn’t he? And quite a power to go\nRANI: with it. Imagine how useful that could be.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 138\nPAZMI: SITS WITH HER BROTHER.\nPAZMI: Can you hear me, Tamoon? Brother? Listen to me.\nPAZMI: I saw the Rani. She’s here.\nPAZMI: I should have killed her out there in the dark between the stars. But I messed up. She belongs in the dark, not you. And the Doctor was with her. What was he doing?\nPAZMI: I thought... I don’t know, I thought he was a good man.\nBREJESH: No sign of them.\nPAZMI: I did see her, I know it. It was the Rani. She’s back, Brejesh. And the Doctor too.\nBREJESH: He’s not helping her. They’re sworn enemies.\nPAZMI: Unless she’s controlling him.\nBREJESH: I don’t think so.\nPAZMI: You know what she’s like. Remember what Chowdras said — she can out-coil a constrictor.\nBREJESH: Come on now. Let go of your brother.\nPAZMI: Not yet.\nBREJESH: We’re going back. Here... my scarf. He can have it. (FX: HE TIES IT ROUND TAMOON) Then you can find him again.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 139\nPAZMI: I thought I’d lost my chance - I took a vow.\nBREJESH: To kill Her?\nPAZMI: To avenge the people who aren’t allowed to die... because of her. (SUDDEN GASP) Ah!\nBREJESH: What is it?\nPAZMI: Tamoon. He squeezed my hand — just a little. I know it. Brother, you know, don’t you? You understand me. And I swear I won’t let you down again.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 140\nKAHNU: SHOWING HIS GUESTS AROUND.\nKAHNU: This is the heart of the Foundry. Where the workers forge the cog-suits.\nDOCTOR: Well... the scale of it is deeply impressive. Congratulations. I’ll never take the dimensional flexibility of my own TARDIS for granted again.\nKAHNU: Yet even now, there are sections hidden away that I cannot access. I know they’re there, but I cannot see them.\nDOCTOR: Rani? You hear that?\nRANI: This is my property.\nDOCTOR: But Raj Kahnu is your successor. When does he get his\nDOCTOR: inheritance?\nRANI: I’m not dead yet! Nor have I abdicated!\nDOCTOR: Queen of a dead world?\nRANI: We shall see.\nDOCTOR: Why? What are you planning?\nKAHNU: What else are you hiding, Mother?\nKAHNU: BEAT.\nRANI: You want to see the rest?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 141\nKAHNU: Yes. Yes, I do.\nRANI: Easily accessed.\nDOCTOR: Is that a set of isomorphic keys?\nRANI: Of course. Keypad!\nDOCTOR: That’s clever.\nRANI: Does your TARDIS not have a free-floating, easily accessible sub-console with voice response in every room? But then it’s an antiquated heap, isn’t it? Not unlike its owner.\nCLOCKWORK: STARTS TO RUN DOWN AND STOP.\nKAHNU: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Your TARDIS is re-activating!\nRANI: Time I made some alterations round here. — Walls! Template 3!\nDOCTOR: Get back!\nKAHNU: My Foundry! No!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: A WALL SMASHES DOWN, RIGHT ONTO IT.\nDOCTOR: Rani! Stop this now!\nRANI: Utility chamber 5.. immediate access!\nDOCTOR: Come back! Wait!\nKAHNU: She’s vanished... gone.\nDOCTOR: She’s still here... barricaded in one of the hidden sections. Panel! (NO RESPONSE) Keypad!\nKAHNU: It only works for her. My Foundry is no longer mine.\nDOCTOR: She must have her own laboratory - somewhere she refined her Ablative samples.\nKAHNU: The people... my people are already contaminated.\nDOCTOR: And ripe for her commands.\nKAHNU: (HORRIFIED) She’s going to bring them back!\nDOCTOR: Unless I find the antidote.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 143\nRANI: Degoor? Are you there?\nDEGOOR: (ON RADIO) Highness, the transmitters are initialising as you ordered.\nRANI: And the rabble?\nDEGOOR: (RADIO) Your receptors remain implanted in the entire local population, yes. For 16 years, they have awaited your orders.\nRANI: At least Raj Kahnu had the wit to keep them fed. How gullible. As soon as initialising is complete, transmit the primary instruction. Let’s drag my devoted subjects back to life.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 144\nDOCTOR: The Rani must have supplies of raw Ablative hidden somewhere.\nKAHNU: I’m lost, Doctor. All these new corridors look the same.\nDOCTOR: Ablative is deadly dangerous. It’s not something you throw away. (FX: THEY STOP) (FRUSTRATED) Please your Highness... come down from the ceiling. It’s hard to hold a conversation like this. And we need to reach the control room.\nKAHNU: It’s safer up here.\nDOCTOR: Rather you than me. But I must find an antidote for all your people.\nKAHNU: Doctovr...\nDOCTOR: If I can counter the Ablative’s influence, I believe their minds will open up again. — Well, that’s being simplistic, but\nDOCTOR: you get the idea. And obviously they’d need therapy afterwards... and counselling...\nKAHNU: Doctor, please listen!\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nKAHNU: There’s a supply of refined Abla culture in one of my storage chambers.\nDOCTOR: Really? You should have said.\nKAHNU: I stacked it there myself, years back, out of the way.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 145\nDOCTOR: And by its basic nature, the Ablative can’t depreciate. Any idea how we get at it?\nKAHNU: I do not know.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Raj Kahnu. This is your ship too. You must have bonded with it by now. One of the things I’ve learned about the Rani is that she never throws stuff away. Even other people’s stuff, worst luck. She archives it, in case it’s useful.\nKAHNU: Then my Foundry still exists?\nDOCTOR: It’s very likely. So come on. Get us out of here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 146\nCONSTANCE: Try again.\nCONSTANCE: BACK.\nCONSTANCE: Very well. The door’s sealed. We’1ll never get out that way!\nCONSTANCE: I know. I’m sorry. So what do we try now?\nCONSTANCE: What’s that?\nCONSTANCE: Get away from the wall! Something’s happening to it!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK) You were right, your Highness. It is your old\nDOCTOR: control room.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Constance! That’s a relief. Can some of your Cog-roach chums\nDOCTOR: shift these crates through here?\nCONSTANCE: Yes, I suppose so.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 147\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Raj Kahnu and I are setting up a temporary lab ina store room we’ve just reinstated.\nDOCTOR: But be careful with that stuff! It’s extremely dangerous. Do\nDOCTOR: you understand?\nCONSTANCE: You're making even less sense than usual. Where have you been?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 148\nDEGOOR: Highness, the transmitters are initialised.\nRANI: (RADIO) About time.\nDEGOOR: The primary instruction is sending already.\nRANI: (RADIO) And the thought for the day is “Protect the Queen”.\nDEGOOR: A triumphant return, your Regal Highness. Soon the old town will be alive again.\nRANI: (RADIO) I must make ready to rally my army.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: BREJESH AND PAZMI HEADING FOR THE PALACE.\nBREJESH: Come on, Pazmi. Chowdras showed me a secret entrance to the Palace.\nPAZMI: (BREATHLESS) You never used to be older than me... but I can’t keep up any more.\nBREJESH: All I had to live on was my wits... and stolen food.\nPAZMI: Uh...\nBREJESH: What is it?\nTRANSMISSION: INSIDE HER HEAD.\nPAZMI: (CONFUSED) My head. I can’t focus. I can’t... uh, what’s the word...\nBREJESH: (ECHOING) Think?\nPAZMI: I don’t know...\nBREJESH: (ECHOING) Remember?\nRANI: (ECHOING) Protect the Queen.\nPAZMI: I don’t know... Oh...\nBREJESH: (ECHOING) Pazmi.. Look at me. It’s Brejesh. Concentrate.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nRANI: (ECHOING) Protect the Queen.\nPAZMI: Yes... Protect the Queen.\nBREJESH: (HIT) Ah! Pazmi, why?\nBREJESH: Come back! Pazmi!\nBREJESH: Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 151\nDOCTOR: Nought point one three one percent Ablative.\nKAHNU: That seems very little.\nDOCTOR: It’s potent stuff. The Rani already used the technique to empty out the minds of her subjects. And she used it again — on the prisoners at Teccaurora. One imposed thought was enough to get her back home again.\nKAHNU: Uh... my head.\nDOCTOR: You’ve been overdoing it. Take a rest. I’ll try to isolate a raw sample.\nKAHNU: I don’t rest! I never have. — I should never have thrown Chowdras out. He always said the Rani would return. I wish he was here now. He knew about the ‘old days’. He said the Rani implanted receptors in the brains of every townsman and woman - and he was right. I have to cut them out of every new Roachman we recruit.\nDOCTOR: Apart from Constance. (CAUTIOUS) Your Highness, what if Chowdras didn’t return?\nKAHNU: (SNAPS) Of course, he will! We’ve argued before. He always comes back in the end. (WINCES) Uh...\nDOCTOR: Your Highness? ...\nDOCTOR: CONTINUOUSLY.\nDOCTOR: (ECHOING) Are you alright?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 152\nKAHNU: This is no good.\nDOCTOR: (ECHOING) Those receptors... did you ever remove them from your own head?\nRANI: (ECHOING) Protect the Queen.\nKAHNU: I have ideas of my own, you know. Thoughts of my own. I don’t\nKAHNU: need other people’s thoughts!\nDOCTOR: (ECHOING) Your Highness...\nRANI: (ECHOING) Protect the Queen!\nDOCTOR: Oof!\nKAHNU: Strangers like you don’t tell me what to do! I have to... I must... protect the Queen!\nKAHNU: BEAT OF SILENCE.\nRANI: Well done, my Prince.\nDOCTOR: (STANDING EFFORTFULLY) Right on cue, Rani. Like a harpy, coming to collect your victim. — Don’t listen to her, Raj Kahnu!\nKAHNU: (FLAT) Keep away from the Queen.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page\nDOCTOR: You of all people can resist her.\nRANI: Don’t waste your breath, Doctor. I’m on home ground now. He comes when I call. You all will. — Kahnu! Follow!\nRANI: 153\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 154\nRANI: Out of my way!\nCONSTANCE: Doctor? How did she get here?\nDOCTOR: (HURRYING IN) Don’t let her through. Block her path!\nCONSTANCE: She can’t go. The doors are sealed.\nRANI: Laughable! — Raj Kahnu is mine! Together we can start a new age!\nDOCTOR: An age of slavery and darkness! Roaches! Defend your Prince!\nKAHNU: SMASHES. ITS COG WHEEL WINDS DOWN.\nKAHNU: The Queen must be protected.\nCONSTANCE: Your Highness, don’t listen!\nRANI: Doors open! (FX: TARDIS DOORS BUZZ OPEN) This way, Kahnu. Follow me.\nRANI: IN FROM OUTSIDE.\nRANI: Who’s this? Get out this roach of my way!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 155\nKAHNU: (STUNNED) No...\nCONSTANCE: It’s carrying a body. Who is it?\nKAHNU: Chowdras...\nRANI: Who is that?\nDOCTOR: It’s Kahnu’s tutor. His friend Chowdras. It’s brought him home.\nKAHNU: (GENTLE) Old man, I never wanted this. What happened?\nRANI: Kahnu, leave him. Follow me now.\nKAHNU: How did you die? I didn’t give you permission to die. —I can’t, I can’t even hold you like this.\nCONSTANCE: What are you doing?\nKAHNU: (HIS VOICE UNTREATED)\nKAHNU: (STRUGGLING) Let me hold him. Let me take his hand just once. (REACHES EFFORTFULLY FOR CHOWDRAS’S HAND) My old friend. My only friend.\nKAHNU: BEAT.\nDOCTOR: Raj Kahnu, it was an accident. I’m sorry.\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED) And you knew?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 156\nDOCTOR: I tried to tell you. It was no-one’s fault. The ground gave way beneath him. He only wanted you to be safe. He loved you very much.\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED) No-one’s fault? Uh... My face is wet. (SNIFFS) What’s this? What’s happening?\nCONSTANCE: Your highness... You're crying.\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED) Crying?\nCONSTANCE: Those are tears. You are allowed to cry, you know.\nDOCTOR: Here you are, old chap, use my handkerchief.\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED)\nRANI: Enough of this. Leave him. Come away now.\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED) (SNIFFS) You want me to leave Chowdras... to abandon my friend?\nRANI: Remember your order. Protect me!\nKAHNU: (UNTREATED) Protect yourself.\nKAHNU: (VOICE TREATED AGAIN) (COLDLY ANGRY) I will not leave.\nCONSTANCE: Kahnu, don’t get angry. Remember your friend.\nKAHNU: I’ll be as angry as I like!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 157\nRANI: (SMOOTH) Of course you’re angry. Poor boy, come with me. Come now!\nKAHNU: No!\nKAHNU: I should never have let you live!\nRANI: You're mine! You belong to me!\nKAHNU: You made me a monster! I am your child!\nDOCTOR: No, Prince! Don’t sink to her level!\nKAHNU: Get out!!\nRANI: You will be mine! (FX: SHE RUNS OFF)\nDOCTOR: Stop her!\nCONSTANCE: She’s gone. It’s too late.\nKAHNU: She’s not done yet. She’s hardly started. (SHOUTS) All of you!\nKAHNU: Hunt her down. Set guards on the gates. Be on full alert. My Palace must be a fortress!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 158\nRANI: (URGENT) Degoor! Degoor, where are you?\nDEGOOR: (APPROACHING ) Highness, what has happened?\nRANI: My forces — are they assembled yet?\nDEGOOR: They entered the town through the Gorian Quarter, yes. They will soon be at the gate.\nRANI: Then I must go to meet them.\nDEGOOR: And Highness, I found this one, wandering in the Palace yard.\nPAZMI: (FLAT) You are the Queen. I must protect you.\nRANI: (AMUSED) Pazmi. Did the Doctor drag you along too?\nPAZMI: Protect the Queen.\nRANI: Do you hear that? How can we lose now? — Welcome home, Pazmi. I shall take this Palace back. My army, with me their Queen at the head!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 159\nDOCTOR: With luck the atomic centrifuge will separate and isolate the Ablative from this brew-up of the Rani’s.\nKAHNU: But will it work?\nDOCTOR: It’s trial and error, Kahnu. But even an error narrows the possibilities.\nCONSTANCE: (ENTERING) Raj Kahnu?\nKAHNU: I said no interruptions while we’re working!\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: There’s a man outside. He has news. His name is Brejesh.\nDOCTOR: Brejesh! Oh, yes. Send him in.\nCONSTANCE: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Kahnu. He’s a friend of Chowdras — and\nDOCTOR: trustworthy, I promise.\nBREJESH: (ENTERING) (WARY) Doctor, you’re here.\nDOCTOR: Brejesh, thank goodness. This is Raj Kahnu.\nBREJESH: Your ‘Highness’. I’ve come from the forest.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 160\nKAHNU: Where the people hide?\nBREJESH: Not anymore. There’s a new thought in the air. The people are pouring up into the town. They shield their eyes from the light, but all they think, all that drives them, is ‘Protect the Queen’.\nKAHNU: Her poison is spreading!\nDOCTOR: Where’s Pazmi? Isn’t she with you?\nBREJESH: The thought took her too. She is lost, I think.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nBREJESH: Is it true? Has the Rani returned?\nCONSTANCE: (RE-ENTERING) Doctor! The Roaches say there are crowds at the gates.\nBREJESH: Already!\nCONSTANCE: And the Rani is at their head.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 161\nCROWD: (WHISPERS) The Queen. The Queen. Protect the Queen.\nRANI: (ADDRESSING CROWD) Good people! My people! Be still!\nRANI: There is one thought. One reason. We go forward — for those who linger are lost. And those who win shall have fresh thoughts!\nCROWD: PLAN/RATAPLAN PLAN PLAN PLAN’. IT GROWS STEADILY LOUDER UNDER THE RANI.\nRANI: My people, we are united, bound by your troth to me. Think on that single thought. One victory, one triumph, one Queen with a God on a leash! Protect me or rue your empty fate for ever! This is our day! I am your Rani!\nRANI: Follow me!\nCROWD: (WHISPERS) The Queen! The Queen! Protect the Queen!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 162\nBREJESH: (SHOCKED) Mrs Clarke? What are you doing? — Don’t get in that machine!\nCONSTANCE: If the mob are coming, we have to hold them back... to win the Doctor more time.\nBREJESH: They’re not ‘the mob’. They’re lost.\nCONSTANCE: Raj Kahnu built this armour for me. If I have to fight, it’1ll make me stronger.\nBREJESH: (DESPAIRING) I can’t fight them. Don’t ask me. My own brother’s\nBREJESH: there.\nCONSTANCE: But the Rani’s in his head. We have to stop them.\nCONSTANCE: (HER VOICE TINNILY DISTORTED INSIDE THE SUIT) Do you want a suit too?\nBREJESH: No. (RELENTING) No, but I’1l1 help... if I can.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Thank you, Brejesh. Just don’t tell the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 163\nDOCTOR: (CAUTIOUS) There it is... the essential unadulterated Ablative.\nKAHNU: Can I suggest...\nDOCTOR: No, don’t touch! Even a miniscule sample like this could wipe out an army. What we need is to work out an antidote.\nKAHNU: In theory... if you exposed the raw Ablative to the Rani’s refined amalgamate... setting one against the other...\nDOCTOR: They’d cancel each other out? I don’t think we’re ready to take that risk yet.\nKAHNU: But we don’t have time to run tests.\nDOCTOR: Then we make time! It’s too risky... your Highness.\nKAHNU: I like risk! Chowdras said that I should always trust my\nKAHNU: instincts.\nDOCTOR: I think you’1ll find even those improve with age.\nKAHNU: In tandem with pomposity?\nDOCTOR: What are you doing? Don’t touch that!\nKAHNU: Ah... Just one dose. One selected atom.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 164\nDOCTOR: Kahnu... you, idiot.\nKAHNU: I already have the refined residue in my blood. We all do.\nDOCTOR: What have you done?\nKAHNU: (HALF LAUGHS) Now... oh... all you have to do... is wait. Good luck...\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 165\nDOCTOR WHO: IN. CLOCKWORKS TURN. A HEAVY STONE OBJECT GRATES SLOWLY FORWARD.\nCONSTANCE: (DISTORTED — IN HER ROACHSUIT) Push! Come on! Against the doors! A bit more!\nBREJESH: (EFFORTFUL) Nearly.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Push!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Done it!\nBREJESH: (PANTING) How fitting. The smashed head of the Rani’s statue. That’1ll block them for a while.\nCONSTANCE: (D)\nCONSTANCE: They’re coming! They’re here already! — Are we ready to hold them back?\nCROWD: (WHISPERS — OFF, GETTING CLOSER) The Queen! The Queen! Protect the Queen!\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING FROM STORAGE CHAMBER) Constance? — Armoured up again, I see.\nCONSTANCE: (D) The Rani’s army, it’s coming. So many of them! And the Foundry doors won’t shut!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 166\nDOCTOR: Well, whatever happens, stay in your suit.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Where’s Kahnu?\nDOCTOR: Asleep. For the first time in his life, I expect.\nCONSTANCE: (D) What?\nDOCTOR: He took a foolish risk. The sort of risk only I’m allowed to take. Now he’s running a fever. I don’t know what the Rani created in him — a freak or a super being. But I won’t let her harm him. I promised Chowdras.\nRANI: There you are, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: My dear Rani, back so soon?\nRANI: My TARDIS, my Palace and my world are all restored to me.\nDOCTOR: How very comforting for you.\nRANI: Where is he? Where’s Raj Kahnu?\nDOCTOR: Ah.. I’m afraid, on that account, you’re too late. Your beloved Prince is dying.\nRANI: Dying? Impossible. Where is he? What have you done to him?!\nDOCTOR: He was trying to save his people from you. It may have cost him\nDOCTOR: his life.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 167\nRANI: Where is he?!\nDOCTOR: He’s through here. Come and see.\nRANI: Out of my way!\nRANI: CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTER) Don’t forget, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: (D) I know. Stay in my suit.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 168\nRANI: (GENTLY) Raj Kahnu?\nDOCTOR: (BEHIND) You see? Slipping away, I fear.\nRANI: He’s cold. He has no pulse...\nDOCTOR: Ah... then perhaps, he’s already... I am truly sorry.\nRANI: My Princeling God...\nDOCTOR: Rani? Is that a brief flicker of maternal protectiveness under your normally adamantine carapace? — Well, who’d have thought it? Don’t worry, I won’t tell a soul.\nRANI: (COLD) He was a failed experiment. No more. I can begin again.\nKAHNU: Rani, you have hearts of ice.\nRANI: (GASPS) You are living.\nKAHNU: Oh, I am a triumph, mm-Mother!\nRANI: And this is a trap! Let me out!\nKAHNU: Keypad!\nRANI: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page\nDOCTOR: I suggest you stay put for a moment, Rani.\nRANI: Let go of me. My people! Protect your Queen!\nKAHNU: Door!\nRANI: You duplicitous child! This is my ship!\nKAHNU: I’ve changed the codes. It’s mine now!\nDOCTOR: Youngsters are like that. Remember us? Always rebelling!\nKAHNU: Activate the fire dowsing system!\nRANI: What?\nDOCTOR: Kahnu, I hope you’ve got the proportions correct.\nKAHNU: Trust me, Doctor. Let’s put the world right at last. Release the Ablative!\nKAHNU: 169\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 170\nCONSTANCE: (D) That spray from the ceiling! What — (REALISATION) “Stay in your suit.” He knew! He knew this was going to happen!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 171\nDOCTOR: Raj Kahnu — go to your people. Tend to them. Minister to their needs. They are returning from the dark!\nRANI: ‘His’ people! They’re mine!\nKAHNU: Cog-roaches — hold her!\nRANI: Get your creatures away from me! (PINNED DOWN) Ah!\nKAHNU: Let the Rani and her Minister Degoor be taken for judgement for her crimes against our world!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 172\nFESTIVAL: ATMOSPHERE.\nCONSTANCE: (NORMAL AGAIN) Pazmi?\nPAZMI: Constance!\nCONSTANCE: You’re looking... well.\nPAZMI: Recovered, yes. We all are. Like clouds lifting. Thanks to you and the Doctor, much is restored.\nCONSTANCE: That’s good. And as for your friend Brejesh.\nPAZMI: A new minister, I know. This will be a famous day. Justice at last. — Come on, we have seats in the court.\nBREJESH: (SLIGHT DISTANCE)\nBREJESH: (ADDRESSING CROWD) Good people! Today Raj Kahnu, our Prince, one thousand blessings upon him, sits in judgement on our former ruler, the Rani. And balance shall be restored.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 173\nDOCTOR: Rani, with the court’s permission, I offer — again — to transport you home to Gallifrey or any other penal institute of their choice. The fact is, I don’t think they want you here anymore.\nRANI: Your favours, Doctor? Don’t make me laugh!\nKAHNU: There is something I would say.\nRANI: Raj Kahnu. You’re almost a God now, but remember who created you. Who gave you such great powers. Now this is your world, will you use those powers to show strength? Or waste them on compassion and futile benevolence?\nKAHNU: Mm-mother, I know what you gave me.. and I offer you this:\nKAHNU: One of the survival pods from your old TARDIS — to leave now.\nDOCTOR: Raj Kahnu! I protest in the strongest terms!\nKAHNU: Enough!\nKAHNU: UNTREATED.\nKAHNU: The Doctor thinks I am amoral. Perhaps I cannot tell good from bad, but I have learned hope and despair. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: Thank you, your Highness.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB)\nKAHNU: Page 174\nKAHNU: You made me a creature of the night, Mother. I shun the light,\nKAHNU: but perhaps that will change.\nRANI: My dear son... Let me embrace you.\nKAHNU: Mother!\nPAZMI: (ALARMED) She’s got a knife!\nCONSTANCE: Kahnu, look out!\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING OVER) Kahnu, are you hurt?\nCONSTANCE: She’s getting away!\nPAZMI: I have her!\nRANI: Ah! — Let me go!\nPAZMI: I swore I’d kill you. Now is the time!\nKAHNU: (TREATED AGAIN) No!\nKAHNU: KAHNU’S SUIT CLOSES.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 175\nKAHNU: No more death! Release her!\nRANI: Thank you... my son. (FX: CROSSES TO POD) Doctor! I waited nearly a hundred years to do justice on you. Thirty-nine thousand days! Your luck won’t last forever!\nRANI: DEMATERIALISATION... AND SHE’S GONE.\nDOCTOR: (STERNLY) Your Highness!\nKAHNU: I know, Doctor. But another death will not heal our world.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t want her killed. What about the chaos she’1ll cause elsewhere?!\nKAHNU: This is my world. These are my laws.\nCONSTANCE: You’re bleeding.\nKAHNU: The wound will heal. — Doctor, we thank you. My people have their old world to rediscover. And I...\nDOCTOR: You have a whole universe to explore.\nKAHNU: My world needs rebuilding first. But perhaps one day.\nCONSTANCE: I've never met a God before.\nDOCTOR: Kahnu only thinks he’s a God. But if he thinks he’s a benevolent one... so be it.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE RANI (004—AB) Page 176\nCONSTANCE: The Rani will be waiting for you, won’t she?\nDOCTOR: That’s unavoidable, Mrs Clarke... Constance. According to her, it’s already happened. But that could change. It’s an infinite universe. It’s just that sometimes, even between old enemies, infinity isn’t big enough.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
