Where are we?\nMARY: (DITTO) Safe.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING FORWARD) At the risk of repeating myself, Mistress Shelley: who are these children?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 8\nFINICIA: Don’t you know who we are, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. Should I?\nLUCERN: (HURRIEDLY) What my sister means is, we live here, at Tranchard’s Folly.\nFINICIA: I’m Finicia. This is my brother, Lucern.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, I don’t keep up with Debrett’s Peerage.\nDOCTOR: (AWKWARD PAUSE. THE DOCTOR IS UNSURE ABOUT THE NEWCOMERS. HAVE THEY MET BEFORE? WHY AREN’T THEY SHOCKED BY THE TARDIS?)\nMARY: It was fortunate for our young guests that I’d resolved to explore our surroundings while you made your repairs, Doctor.\nLUCERN: Repairs? Is the machine not safe?\nDOCTOR: Nothing to worry about. Just a matter of sequential regression.\nMARY: (TO TWINS) Please, excuse the Doctor. Often he gabbles thus.\nDOCTOR: Fast return switch. Brings the TARDIS back to its previous co- ordinates. It engaged by accident and brought us here. Which was odd, don’t you think, Finicia?\nFINICIA: Why odd?\nDOCTOR: Well, I’ve never been here before. (FX: CLAPS HANDS DECISIVELY) Right, then, children — let’s see if we can’t take a closer look at this mystery assailant of yours...\nDOCTOR: LUCERN/FINICIA: We’re not children.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 9\nDOCTOR: (SNIFFS) Good. This isn’t a créche.\nMARY: How old are you, my dear?\nFINICIA: Seventeen. So’s he.\nLUCERN: We’re twins.\nMARY: Barely younger than I, Doctor. (PROVING THAT THEY’RE NOT\nCHILDREN: ) And I have a child of my own waiting for me, you’1l recall.\nDOCTOR: You've also got a novel in you that’1ll be revered as long as the English language abides. I doubt this pair ever wrote anything longer than 140 characters.\nDOCTOR: Aha, there she is...\nDOCTOR: (FX: OVER SCANNER, THE WITCH FROM THE WELL SCRATCHES AT THE TARDIS DOOR. )\nWITCH: (DISTORTED, VIA SCANNER) Izala. Tutanon...!\nDOCTOR: Well, she won’t get in with only her fingernails. Impressive though they are.\nMARY: Poor creature. There is something wretched about it, I think.\nFINICIA: Did you not see what it did, to those workmen?\nLUCERN: What it wanted to do to us?\nDOCTOR: You’1l have to excuse Mary. She tends to side with the monster...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 10\nFINICIA: (COLD) It killed Aleister Portillon. Thirteenth Earl of Whetstone.\nLUCERN: Our father.\nMARY: Forgive me.\nFINICIA: Are you sure it can’t get in?\nDOCTOR: Quite sure. I wish I knew what it was, though, and what it’s doing on twenty-first century Earth. Some sort of mutant?\nLUCERN: It’s a witch.\nMARY: A witch?\nFINICIA: The witch from the well.\nDOCTOR: The well?\nLUCERN: It’s an old well. It must have been hidden for centuries. They opened it just now and the witch came out.\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nFINICIA: What are you doing, Doctor?\nMARY: The TARDIS has an electrical library — greater than Alexandria, the Doctor claims. Quite astonishing.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Mary. I’m sure Finicia is familiar with search engines, albeit the TARDIS database is slightly larger than the ones she’s used to.\nDOCTOR: 10\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 11\nDOCTOR: (FX: A LITTLE ELECTRONIC BURBLE INDICATES THAT THE INFORMATION HAS COME UP ON THE SCREEN)\nDOCTOR: Here we are... Hmm. It seems there used to be a village on this Site, back in the seventeenth century. Tranchard’s Fell.\nFINICIA: We know.\nLUCERN: (HURRIEDLY) Our house was named after it.\nDOCTOR: (SKIM-READING) Usual brouhaha over land rights, retainers wages, poaching.. Aha! Here she is.\nMARY: The witch?\nDOCTOR: Well, a witch scare. Coercion, torture, execution. Barbarians!\nLUCERN: What did we tell you? The witch.\nDOCTOR: Well here’s something you couldn’t have told me. Six months before the scare, a Varaxil ship crossing Earth’s solar system was lost.\nMARY: And you believe this ship ran aground here? Like the fallen Cybermen in Vienna?\nDOCTOR: It’s not hard to see what might have happened. A bunch of superstitious locals capture a crash-landed alien, call ita witch and bury it alive down a well. You know, there are times when your species appals me.\nMARY: The seventeenth century was an uncivilised age.\nDOCTOR: Aren’t they all...\nMARY: But surely such a cosmic traveller could not still be alive, after three or four hundred years down a well?\nMARY: 11\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 12\nDOCTOR: That’s the thing about us aliens. We’re not the same as you. Different lifespans, different anatomy, different opinions. (TO LUCERN & FINICIA) By the way, Lucern and Finicia — yes, there are such things as aliens. Yes, this is a time and space machine. No, I wouldn’t believe it either.\nFINICIA: You just carry on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Kids today. No sense of wonder. (BEAT) Here’s what we’re going to do: we’re going back in time, back to Tranchard’s Fell.\nLUCERN: (NERVOUS) Why?\nDOCTOR: So we can find out exactly what happened here, all whose years\nDOCTOR: ago. Find out what that creature is, and how to help it.\nFINICIA: Help it? It killed our father. We should kill it in return.\nDOCTOR: An eye for an eye and we all go blind. Right, hold on\nDOCTOR: everyone. Seventeenth century here we come!\nDOCTOR: (FX: HE THROWS SWITCHES. THE TIME COLUMN VWORPS! AS THE SHIP DEMATERIALISES, CROSSFADE TO: )\nDOCTOR: 4: CLEARING NEAR TRANCHARD’S FOLLY\nWITCH: Izala. Tutanon. Doctor. (CACKLES) Doctor...!

THE IDYLL’S INTERRUPTED AS THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. DOOR OPENS. )\nDOCTOR: (INHALING) Ahhh! Taste that pre-Industrial Revolution air, kids! Not a pollutant for miles!\nFINICIA: (EMERGING) Was it difficult, Doctor, finding a safe place to land your ship?\nLUCERN: Without hitting a tree, she means.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS does most of the work. I just point her in the right direction.\nLUCERN: You mean, it doesn’t need you?\nDOCTOR: We need each other. But she can always find her way back.\nFINICIA: Always?\nMARY: (EMERGING) So the TARDIS was working properly, after all?\nDOCTOR: That’s sequential regression for you. All the right co- ordinates, just not necessarily in the right order.\nMARY: (TAKING A FEW PACES AWAY FROM THE TARDIS) Look, there’s a farm down there! We must be close to the village.\nDOCTOR: Let’s take a look around. Come on, you lot. Follow me! (HE STARTS TO SCRAMBLE DOWN A SLOPE, LOSES HIS FOOTING & TUMBLES) Woooah! (MINOR LANDSLIDE, DOCTOR BOUNCING WITH IT.) Ow! Ooof!\nMARY: (CALLING) Doctor! Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING, BELOW) Watch your step, that slope’s tricky!\nDOCTOR: 13\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 14\nMARY: The seventeenth century, Doctor! Milton, Rubens, Purcell! How thrilling.\nDOCTOR: The Great Plague, the Thirty Years’ War, the execution of Filippo Bruno for the heresy of calling the Sun a star.\nMARY: Travellers from the stars, marooned like Selkirk was — will be - on foreign shores. Are you acquainted with these Varaxil folk?\nDOCTOR: Actually, they rather keep to themselves. Their technology's based on Odic energy. It’s a kind of alternative science — the principle behind it being the harnessing of the paranormal. It’s a little hard to explain — or to understand.\nMARY: I understand an oxymoron when I hear it, Doctor. A science based on superstition?\nDOCTOR: Conventional physics is the natural order of the cosmos. The existence of Odic energy contradicts every natural law we know. Nonetheless, it appears that evolution produces rare minds among every sentient race that are able to channel it. Most of them don’t even know what they’re doing. They become healers, prophets... madmen.\nMARY: That seems a somewhat medieval outlook.\nDOCTOR: The Varaxils isolated Odic energy; they synthesized it; they built their civilisation on its power. It’s incredibly sophisticated, closer to an art than a science. But to people from this period of Earth’s history, the Varaxil’s Odic energy would be indistinguishable from magic. Witchcraft.\nMARY: Then we must find that ship of theirs.\nMARY: 14\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 15\nDOCTOR: Indeed so. (THEY SET OFF AGAIN) Being accused of witchcraft is something the Varaxils came to expect. Many supposedly enlightened races denounced their science as heresy. The Varaxils became pariahs. They were persecuted throughout your galaxy. Rather tragic.\nLUCERN: (CALING FROM OFF) Doctor! Mary! We’re here!\nDOCTOR: It seems the twins have found the farmhouse. Come on.\nDOCTOR: 15\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 16\nDOCTOR: (FX: A LOW WHISTLING WIND, OTHERWISE SILENCE. THE FARM’S DESERTED, IN A WAY THAT GIVES YOU GOOSEBUMPS. )\nFINICIA: The place is deserted.\nLUCERN: I don’t like this. It feels all wrong.\nFINICIA: Wrong? Of course it’s wrong. Everything’s wrong, Lucern.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Looks like no one’s home.\nMARY: No livestock either. And the fields are unploughed.\nDOCTOR: (RATTLES PADLOCK ON BARN DOOR) And yet this barn’s locked up. Why lock an abandoned barn?\nLUCERN: Unless it isn’t really abandoned.\nDOCTOR: We should be getting on.\nMARY: To Tranchard’s Fell? Won’t the villagers be surprised by our appearance?\nDOCTOR: Just say you’re from London. That usually works. Look, we won't find the Varaxil ship without a little help from the locals.\nFINICIA: What makes you think they’1l know where it crashed?\nDOCTOR: They’re locals — locals always know these sorts of things. Just leave the talking to me. With any luck, they’ll bea friendly bunch.\nDOCTOR: 16\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 17\nVILLAGERS: Let her drown!/Beat the Devil from her!/She levelled my grain!

We’1ll be safe in The Lord’s house. What will\nMARY: you be doing, in the meantime?\nDOCTOR: Never you mind. Just look after the children.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MARY, LUCERN & FINICIA MOVE OFF.

Looked like she had the Squire’s young ‘uns with her...\nDOCTOR: The Squire’s-? Ah, yes: blue blood. I daresay there’s a familial resemblance. (ALOUD) Never mind about that. Tell me about the... ah... witch.\nBEATRIX: Agnes Bates? She were the one took me from my mother’s womb. Birthed most of Tranchard’s Fell, she has. We’re lucky we don’t all carry Satan’s mark!\nBEATRIX: (FX: A COMMOTION, OFF.

I’ve seen sights such as would make you weep with the beauty of them. And I’ve seen you, Lord of Time!\nDOCTOR: What did she say-?\nBEATRIX: I told you, sir, you don’t want to listen to her devil words.\nDOCTOR: Where are they taking her?\nBEATRIX: To the cells. Master Kincaid’s on his way from Lincoln. He’1l get her confession, if he has to pull her lying tongue by the root!\nDOCTOR: Who is this Master Kincaid?\nBEATRIX: Where’ve you been, sir? John Kincaid — he’s Parliament’s man.\nBEATRIX: The Witch-Pricker!\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MOB MOVES OFF, CHANTING IN THE WAKE OF AGNES AND HER GUARDS. )\nVILLAGERS: Prick her flesh!

Mary!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Who profanes this church with such disrespect? Tone down you voice, sir!\nDOCTOR: Um. Sorry. Didn’t mean to interrupt. I’m the Doctor. I’m looking for my friends. They said they’d be here.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: A woman, in the company of two youths?\nDOCTOR: That’1ll be them. Where are they?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: They disappeared the moment I arrived. I barely glimpsed the children before they scurried away. They stayed in shadow — as if avoiding my sight.\nDOCTOR: Did they indeed? Might I enquire as to your name?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Claude Portillon, sir. My family’s served this village since the Black Death.\nDOCTOR: You're the Squire! No wonder they kept their faces in shadow.\nDOCTOR: Although how they knew-?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Do you travel with Master Kincaid’s entourage? Is he close?\nDOCTOR: I really don’t think he and I would see eye to eye.\nDOCTOR: 20\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 21\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (CONFIDENTIAL) I must admit that I, too, have reservations. I was praying for guidance when you arrived. I may have summoned Kincaid to Tranchard’s Fell a little too precipitately.\nDOCTOR: His kind are always summoned precipitately. Look, very sorry to rush like this, but I need to find my friends.\nCORNET SWALLOW: Squire Portillon! (HE NOTICES THE DOCTOR & STOPS) Oh.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Speak freely, Cornet. This gentleman and I were discussing... um.. church matters. Do you have news?\nCORNET SWALLOW: The Witch-Pricker’s here, sir. He bade me inform you immediately. Says he wants to address the village.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Oh my! Help me prepare the church, Cornet. We must make this a\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Suitable pulpit for such a man as John Kincaid!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) This is going to be very ugly.\nDOCTOR: 21\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 22\nDOCTOR: (FX: A COLUMN OF HORSES PASSES CLOSE BY.

NOW THERE’S JUST THE GENERAL LOW BUZZ OF VILLAGE LIFE. A SMITHY’S HAMMERING SOMEWHERE. )\nLUCERN: We need to get back to the TARDIS.\nMARY: We need to wait for the Doctor. He’1ll have a plan.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) He certainly will. Although there are one or two slightly fuzzy stages.\nMARY: (OVERJOYED TO SEE HIM) Doctor! You found us!\nDOCTOR: No thanks to you. Next time, perhaps you could see a way to being where you say you’1ll be-?\nMARY: There was someone in the church. The twins were unsettled by\nMARY: him.\nLUCERN: No we weren’t.\nFINICIA: I was. He made my skin crawl. He looked like a ghost.\nFINICIA: 22\nFINICIA: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs\nDOCTOR: In a way he is. The Squire’s one of your ancestors, nice enough fellow, for the time.\nFINICIA: We shouldn’t be here, Doctor. It’s not safe.\nDOCTOR: Page 23\nDOCTOR: I think. A\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’ve a feeling Tranchard’s Fell is about to go a little\nDOCTOR: mad, now that the Witch-Pricker’s in town.\nMARY: Is that who just rode in?\nDOCTOR: Yep. So we need to find that lost Varaxil before he does.\nMARY: I should take the twins back to the TARDIS. They’1l be safe\nMARY: within until we’re done.\nDOCTOR: You should stay there as well, Mary. I won’t be far behind. I\nDOCTOR: promise.\nMARY: What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: I thought I might take in a show...\nDOCTOR: 23\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 24\nDOCTOR: (FX: MASTER KINCAID’S WORDS ECHO FROM THE PULPIT, AROUND THE CHURCH HALL...)\nMASTER KINCAID: (ORATING) You all know me: I am John Kincaid, Parliament’s appointed jurisconsult in matters of witchcraft.

THEY’RE GLAD HE’S HERE TO SAVE THEM. )\nMASTER KINCAID: In France and in the Low Countries, there are whole villages not unlike Tranchard’s Fell that have fallen from grace.

The farmer, and his wife. Our priest, who visited here the day before they were found. And two others, whose identity we have not yet established. Itinerants, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Just grey husks, the vital spark sucked out of them. You’d hardly know that they used to be human.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: There’s witchcraft abroad, Doctor. We fight for our very souls here.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 28\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 29\nDOCTOR: When did this happen?

His manner was eccentric — but he seemed unexceptional.\nMASTER KINCAID: Unexceptional? He evaded the finest troops I could muster in Lincoln. Such a feat smacks of sorcery. As does crippling you with a demonic charm.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: You can put your divine certainties aside on that account, Witch-Pricker. I was taken by surprise.

It’s been hours.\nMARY: Half an hour at most. I’ve told you — the TARDIS cannot leave before the Doctor returns.\nFINICIA: But what if he’s dead?\nMARY: For the last time, Finicia, the Doctor is not dead. He’s\nMARY: waiting for night to fall, that is all.\nFINICIA: Night has fallen, Mary. Can’t you see?\nMARY: He'll be here. I am sure of it. (SHE ISN’T) Quite... sure. But perhaps, just to ease your nerves, I should take a look outside. Now: which of these devices works the door...?\nLUCERN: This one, isn’t it?\nMARY: It is, Lucern.

I should think half the county can hear you.\nMARY: (OVERJOYED) Doctor! Are you hurt?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) No, just extricating myself from some brambles. I wonder if you’d mine getting my secateurs? You’1l find them in the library under ‘B’ for Capability Brown.\nMARY: Of course. I shan’t be a moment!\nMARY: 34\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 35\nMARY: (WALKING IN) Did you hear that, children?

(WALKING FORWARD, CROSS) Stop playing with\nMARY: those controls, and open that door at once!\nLUCERN: Silly me. Now which of the controls was it again...?\nFINICIA: That lever, wasn’t it, brother?\nMARY: Lucern, no! That wasn’t it-!\nLUCERN: (FLAT ACTING) Oh dear. Now what have I done-?\nMARY: (AT CONSOLE) Pull it back! Pull the lever back!\nFINICIA: Too late for that, I think...\nMARY: But the Doctor’s out there!\nDOCTOR: No, no, no! MARY!

Can’t understand a word you’re saying.\nDOCTOR: It’s quite simple. Lokic fields cancel Odic energy. It’s like night and day; you can’t have both at the same time. So why would a Varaxil vessel based on Odic energy be carrying a Lokic containment web? It’s like a drowning man clutching a supply of lead weights to keep afloat.\nBEATRIX: Here, that’s not a person in there! It’s a demon! Look: horns...\nBEATRIX: and hooves!

Before you know it, it’ll steal your soul.\nDOCTOR: We’ve nothing to fear, Beatrix. This imp is a prisoner; an\nDOCTOR: Odic channeller incarcerated by the Varaxils. Why, though?\nDOCTOR: 48\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 49\nBEATRIX: It’s moving! It’s reaching for us!\nDOCTOR: It’s reaching for something. Of course: the fractured power cell! Oh, that’s not good. Not good at all.\nBEATRIX: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The imp’s diluting. The power cell must be interfering with the Lokic field. Quick, Beatrix: hand it over. There might still be time to help it!\nBEATRIX: Help it? You’re fit for Bedlam, stranger! I’1l not stay with you! Here’s your devilish power cell.\nBEATRIX: I'm off!\nDOCTOR: Beatrix! Come back! Beatrix!\nDOCTOR: (FX: ANOTHER ELECTRICAL CRACKLE. THE CONTAINMENT FIELD FLUCTUATES & WEAKENS.

I warn you, I can defend myself!\nALEISTER: Oww! My nose!!!\nMARY: Let that be a lesson to you not to attack people in the middle of the night!\nALEISTER: I’m sorry! I thought you were that thing from the well.\nMARY: The witch? Have you seen it?\nALEISTER: Not lately, thankfully. I played dead when it attacked me. Barely dared move since. I think it might be in the house, I didn’t dare go call for help. Not on my own, at least. I’m Aleister Portillon, Thirteenth Earl of Whetstone.\nMARY: Of course! I thought I recognized the nose. The Squire’s is identical.\nMARY: 50\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 51\nALEISTER: The Squire?\nMARY: An ancestor of yours.\nALEISTER: You seem to be very well acquainted with my family history. Your face is somehow familiar to me, too. Are you in the book?\nMARY: No, sir, I write them — or will do. Now come with me. We must find the twins.\nALEISTER: Twins?\nMARY: Lucern and Finicia. Your children. Perhaps they’1l show themselves if their father calls.\nALEISTER: I think there’s been a misunderstanding. I’ve no children —\nALEISTER: twins or otherwise. I’m not even married.\nMARY: I beg your pardon?\nMARY: 51\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 52\nMARY: (FX: A COLUMN OF SOLDIERS CLATTER BY.

Oh, why won’t any of you idiots listen?\nBEATRIX: FINICIA [C17]: (APPROACHING) Soldier! Let this poor woman be! Can’t you see she’s disturbed?\nCORNET SWALLOW: We found her in the barley fields, Mistress Portillon. She’d broken the cordon.\nCORNET SWALLOW: FINICIA [C17]: Well, that’s no reason to bind her wrists and rope her like a common thief.\nCORNET SWALLOW: We're the Witch-Pricker’s men. We’ve authority here.\nCORNET SWALLOW: FINICIA [C17]:\nCORNET SWALLOW: I’m the Squire’s daughter, and you’re here at my father’s request. Now untie her!\nCORNET SWALLOW: (SNIFFS) Well... I suppose she don’t look much like a witch. Untie her lads.\nCORNET SWALLOW: FINICIA [C17]: I’1ll take her from here. Be on your way, cornet.\nCORNET SWALLOW: By your leave, miss.

Then you must tell me everything. The Devil’s on Vetter’s Tor, you say?\nALEISTER: Shouldn’t we just contact the authorities? They can sort everything out.\nMARY: We can’t leave the twins alone here with the creature!\nALEISTER: Look, I don’t know these twins. As far as I’m concerned, they’re intruders. They deserve whatever’s coming to them.\nMARY: You, sir, are a coward!\nALEISTER: That’s funny.\nMARY: Cowardice amuses you, does it?\nALEISTER: No, I didn’t mean that. I meant the blue box.

(A DECISION) Master Kincaid, when I wrote you that letter regarding Mistress Bates, I [may have]-\nMASTER KINCAID: Agnes Bates is the heart of the evil afflicting your village, Squire. It’s my belief she was sent to drag you all to Hell.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: I fear she’s a gull. There have been whispers against her ever since my wife’s death, Master Kincaid.\nMASTER KINCAID: All the more reason to suspect she’s guilty. She’ll confess. And, the angels willing, she’ll die redeemed.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Convicted and then tried. Isn’t that the wrong way round?\nMASTER KINCAID: I know you, sir. You were in this church when I spoke yesterday — and again by the farm. You showed me scant regard.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) “Judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.” A friend of mine wrote that. Or will write that — assuming I get her home in one piece.\nMASTER KINCAID: Guard — arrest this outsider!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Master Kincaid! This church is a place of sanctuary.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 54\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 55\nMASTER KINCAID: (ARRESTING THE SOLDIER) Hold! Wait for me outside.\nMASTER KINCAID: You’1l hear his petition, Squire? After he attacked you at Morris’s barn?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, things were a bit chaotic then. Slightly clearer now. Your village is in danger, Squire Portillon. Kincaid can’t save you, but I think I can.\nMASTER KINCAID: His words are traps. He’1ll lure you into Hell.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: In this matter, I'll be the judge. Doctor, will you dine with me at the manor house?\nDOCTOR: That would be splendid. I must say, you’re being terribly reasonable about all this.\nDOCTOR: 55\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 56\nMARY: (FX: SHAKING ALEISTER) Aleister! Aleister!

Surely this snare was laid in preparation for that creature? The witch from the well?\nALEISTER: We should call the police.

In fact, there are no witches anywhere — except the Witch Dimension of Hecatrix, of course. Quite a few there.\nMASTER KINCAID: Pah! You babble, sir. I have met many witches in my time. Aye, and defeated their devilry.\nDOCTOR: Executed them, you mean.\nMASTER KINCAID: ‘tis the only way.\nDOCTOR: (HOTLY) It is NOT the only way!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (CALMING) You say there are no witches, Doctor. Very well, then who killed the farmer and those others?\nDOCTOR: Good question. It’s questions like that which might just enable us to come through this without anyone else getting hurt. Now, brace yourselves for a culture shock: those people were killed by a traveller from another world.\nMASTER KINCAID: There is Earth, there is Heaven, there is Hell. If the murderer did not come from Earth, nor from Heaven — since when did angels kill — then the other world you refer to must be Hell. We are in agreement, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: We are not! I mean from another celestial body. Speaking of bodies, we have a problem: the alien lifeform has altered its shape. It looks human.\nMASTER KINCAID: The devil in man’s likeness. I have encountered this, too. You are saying this demon stalks the village in the guise of Agnes Bates.\nMASTER KINCAID: 57\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 58\nDOCTOR: No, not Agnes Bates! Can’t you see she’s innocent?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: If not Agnes, Doctor, then another of the accused?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. The creature’s clever, it wouldn’t draw attention to itself. I don’t know what it wants, exactly. But I do know it’s dangerous.\nMASTER KINCAID: (SWEEPING A GOBLET & SOME PAPERS OFF THE TABLE IN A SUDDEN BURST OF FURY) Enough of this!

Their mother was sweet and lovely, the village adored her. (BEAT) She died. Broke the Squire’s heart. Some of us only have the one, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SHARPLY) What did you say?\nAGNES: The one sweetheart.\nDOCTOR: I see. And the Squire blamed you for her death?\nAGNES: He was the only one what didn’t. He knew his little ones would be in the earth beside her, if not for me.\nDOCTOR: But the villagers didn’t see things that way.\nAGNES: They said I’d dallied with the Squire. Murdered my rival. I had to leave Tranchard’s Fell. Made my home in the forest by Sutherland’s Meadow.\nDOCTOR: The stories weren’t true, I take it?\nAGNES: A peasant girl and a Squire? I don’t know what it’s like where you come from, but that sort of thing doesn’t happen here.\nAGNES: 64\nAGNES: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 65\nDOCTOR: Tell me about the gift, Agnes.\nAGNES: Come again?\nDOCTOR: The second sight. The clairvoyance — or is it X-ray vision?\nAGNES: I don’t know what you mean.\nDOCTOR: You said I wasn’t local. You know I have two hearts. You called me a Lord of Time when you first saw me. You even spoke of silver ships. You don’t heal your patients with herbs, do you, Agnes? You can see what’s under their skin. What else do you see?\nAGNES: I told you. I ain’t a witch, whatever they say.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know that. Your mind’s exceptional, Agnes Bates — you’re an evolutionary quirk. A leap forward. Oh, this is so typical! The future of humanity right in front of them, and they want to see you hang!\nAGNES: I reckon you’ve had a bit too much sun, laddie.\nBEATRIX: (OFF, MUFFLED. STRUGGLING, OUTSIDE THE DOOR) Let me go!

Satan’s consorts will swing before the sun sets!\nCORNET SWALLOW: They’1l be equal to the task, Master Kincaid.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (APPROACHING) Could the scaffolding not wait until after the verdict is heard, Witch-Pricker? It seems a little premature.\nMASTER KINCAID: It would be a pity to restrain such industriousness, Squire Portillon. Cornet Swallow and his men are raising hanging posts fit for a king, had we still a king to hang.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Even without a king, Master Kincaid, we must be kingly in meting out justice. I want a fair trial. There’1ll be no mob rule here.\nMASTER KINCAID: I see, Squire. So what you’re saying is that you won’t believe these three are witches until they themselves confess it?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Precisely. (REALISES WHAT HE’S SAYING) No, wait! I never meant—\nMASTER KINCAID: I know exactly what you meant, sir. And I shall draw proofs of their guilt soon enough — starting with the coven leader: the Doctor!\nMASTER KINCAID: 74\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 75\nAGNES: I don’t understand it. I brought them twins into the world. Their little hearts nearly broke when their mother died. Good kids, both of ‘em, just as she was. They’d spare a lame dog.\nDOCTOR: The Lucien and Finicia you knew are gone, Agnes. They’ve been replaced. Changelings.\nAGNES: (SCOFFING) Now that sounds like sorcery, Doctor!\nBEATRIX: Thought you said there weren’t no such thing as magic.\nDOCTOR: There ain’t. Isn’t. But there is a wrecked alien spacecraft on Vetter’s Tor, Beatrix, and I’m very much afraid that’s worse.\nBEATRIX: For you two, you mean. Them nooses ain’t for me. Miss Portillon — Finicia — she’s my friend, she told me she were. She’ll see I don’t hang.\nAGNES: Then why are you down here?\nDOCTOR: You're guilty by association, Beatrix. You visited the spacecraft, with me. That makes you dangerous — at least in the eyes of the twins.\nAGNES: Hush now, someone’s coming.\nMASTER KINCAID: (FX: CELL DOOR’S UNBOLTED, SWINGS OPEN) Doctor. I trust you and your acolytes have all that you require?\nDOCTOR: To be frank, I’ve been imprisoned in better facilities.\nMASTER KINCAID: Then I bring you joyous news: your discomfiture is nearly at an end. First we have the tedious formality of a confession. (FX: CLAPPING HANDS) Guards, bring him!\nMASTER KINCAID: 75\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 76\nMASTER KINCAID: (FX: ALEISTER’S BREATHING HARD — SCARED OUT OF HIS WITS BY THEIR ENCOUNTER WITH THE WITCH FROM THE WELL. )\nALEISTER: We have to get out of the house. That thing will be back.\nMARY: Alas, the doors will still be barred to us, as they were to the Witch. Now, then — stiffen your resolve, sir. You’re no help to me like this.\nALEISTER: You’re right, of course. Look at this library! A blessed shrine to a man with a heart of oak. I know every detail of the 6t Baron’s life, but when I need a dash of his nobility and courage, I’m put to shame by — a girl.\nMARY: You’d be surprised, I think, how much time Byron spent hiding behind women’s skirts.\nALEISTER: (PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) So then — what’s the plan?\nMARY: The cage that snared the witch was insubstantial. Did you see how its flux made the poor thing dance before it faded, like one of Signore Galvani’s severed limbs?\nALEISTER: Signore Galvani?\nMARY: We must investigate the provenance of those unearthly energies.\nALEISTER: Well I can assure you you’ll get no help from any of the\nALEISTER: volumes on these shelves. It’s all history and biography.\nMARY: Then we must return to the TARDIS. (STRIDES OFF) Come along.\nMARY: 76\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 77\nDOCTOR: I say, is this a genuine Inquisitional chair, or just a reproduction? I’ve always wanted to see the real McCoy.\nMASTER KINCAID: There’s nothing unreal about this chair, Doctor. Except, perhaps, the pain it can inflict. (FINISHES TIGHTENING THE SCREWS) The clamps holding your wrists, chest and legs can be tightened, making the spikes on the back, the seat and in the arm rests more... vexing. If you prove uncooperative, that is.\nDOCTOR: If I don’t confess, you mean.\nMASTER KINCAID: Quite so, Doctor. Now, before we employ the chair’s more imaginative features, why not simply confess? Tell me freely how you’ve served Satan and denounced our Lord. Admit you corrupted Agnes Bates and the other wench, as you planned to corrupt this village. Confess to that and I’1ll release you from this chair at once.\nDOCTOR: I see. And if I confess, you’1ll set Agnes and Beatrix free?\nMASTER KINCAID: Alas, I cannot promise that. But I can guarantee that I’1l give both them and you swift deaths on the gallows. You’1l be judged in a higher court, where I’m sure repentance will count in your favour.\nDOCTOR: Kincaid: if anyone needs to repent, it’s you! Agnes forgave this village, she continued healing them even after they cast her out. You know that! As for Beatrix, the girl’s hardly a master criminal — how could she possibly threaten anyone?\nMASTER KINCAID: The ignorant make the most reliable followers, Doctor. But enough of your acolytes. I’m much more interested in you. Why are you here? You seem to take such pleasure questioning our certainties. That’s Satan’s work, wouldn’t you say?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you’d know. Look, I told you at the Squire’s: we can get through this without anyone else getting hurt.\nMASTER KINCAID: Sinners cannot go unpunished.\nMASTER KINCAID: 77\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 78\nDOCTOR: Careful, Kincaid. It almost sounds like you take a pride in your work. Isn’t that a sin?\nMASTER KINCAID: I’m a humble servant of Church and State, Doctor. Nothing more.\nDOCTOR: Exactly! But you could be so much more, if only you set aside your prejudices. You’re a clever man, Kincaid, so don’t behave like a stupid one. Agnes has none of your knowledge and yet you could learn so much from her.\nMASTER KINCAID: The unwashed have nothing to teach educated men.\nDOCTOR: She sees, she thinks, she makes connections. If you had your way, I doubt the human race would’ve left the caves.\nMASTER KINCAID: (CLOSE TO THE DOCTOR) Hurts, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: (IN PAIN, BUT HIDING IT) All I ask, Kincaid, is that two innocent women don’t suffer for my so-called crimes. I’11 answer for my own life, but I won’t have anyone else die for me.\nMASTER KINCAID: Noble sentiments, Doctor. Worthy of a martyr. But I have what I needed: you’ve confessed to your crimes, you accept your punishment and you wish your fellow sinners to be redeemed alongside you. (CALLS) Guards!\nDOCTOR: That’s not what I said!\nMASTER KINCAID: The devil is in the details, Doctor. At noon, your unholy trinity will hang. (GUARDS ENTER) Take the warlock back to the cells. He wishes to make peace with His Maker. Goodbye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (FRANTIC) Kincaid! Listen! The twins: they’re not —\nDOCTOR: 78\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 79\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Eleven o’clock, sister. The Witch-Pricker must have his confession by now.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: The Gallifreyan and his companions will be dead soon. And any suspicions against us will die with them.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: The Doctor and the girl have to hang. I don’t question that. But the old healer’s no danger to us.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: She’s unlucky, that’s all. The whole village thinks she’s a witch already — if she were saved from the rope, the guilt of the others would be doubted as well.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Five dead at the barn, and now this.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: We didn’t choose to crash on such a savage world. We must do what’s necessary to survive and continue our mission.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Our mission doesn’t licence the murder of the untainted.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: You scanned the healer yourself. You saw the readings. She’s primitive — hollow. The universe won’t mourn her passing. Come along, brother, we should go to the square. ‘Father’ will be waiting.\nDOCTOR: 79\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 80\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS DOORS SWING OPEN. MARY AND ALEISTER ENTER. ALEISTER STOPS DEAD)\nMARY: Come on in, sir. I assure you, it is perfectly safe.\nALEISTER: But.. this is impossible!\nMARY: Evidently not, since you are standing in it. The Doctor explained it to me when I boarded. Though not at all clearly. Truth be told, he’s rarely clear.\nALEISTER: It’s bigger on the [inside —]\nMARY: For my peace of mind, I’ve resolved to view it as a form of perspective. Once inside, we see space around us expanded, much as we see distance and depth within a flat canvas by Claude or Poussin.\nALEISTER: That makes no sense at all.\nMARY: I fear it’s the best I can offer. (STARTS WALKING AGAIN) This way.\nALEISTER: (FOLLOWING) Where are we going?\nMARY: (OFF, ECHOING) The Doctor’s library.

I’m innocent, you see.\nCORNET SWALLOW: And you can shut up too, butcher’s dam, else I’1l gag you!\nDOCTOR: Best do as he says, Beatrix.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BAYING MOB COMES INTO EARSHOT AS THEY APPROACH THE HANGING POSTS. )\nVILLAGERS: Let’s see ‘em hang!/Send them witches back to hell!/They levelled my crops!/Aye, and made my cows barren!

Somehow.\nAGNES: If you believe that, you’re madder’n she is.\nMASTER KINCAID: (OFF) Up on the platform with them, Cornet — so they can face their accusers. Let the villagers see their infernal aspects!\nMASTER KINCAID: 81\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 82\nCORNET SWALLOW: You heard the Witch-Pricker. Turn around.\nVILLAGERS: Hang ‘em! Hang ‘em! Hang ‘em! [ETC]\nBEATRIX: Oh Lord. We’re doomed!\nMASTER KINCAID: (ORATING) Secure the nooses, Cornet! Let none of them wriggle free!\nDOCTOR: Listen to me! You’re in danger, all of you! A very real danger. Up on Vetter’s Tor, there’s a ship — a vessel — that’s crash-landed here from —\nDOCTOR: Oh, the fruit thrower! I might have known you'd be here!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (FX: RUSHING FORWARD, UP WOODEN STEPS) Wait! Master Kincaid. Wait!\nDOCTOR: Squire Portillon! You don’t half leave things until the last minute.\nSQUIRE: (TO THE CROWD) P-perhaps there is something in what the Doctor says. This all began with the lights over the Tor, last spring, did it not?\nMASTER KINCAID: (SOTTO TO PORTILLON) Don’t be a fool, Squire. Cross me and you’ll be joining them on this scaffold. (TO THE CROWD) A ship, run aground on a hillside? Only Satan’s silver tongue\nMASTER KINCAID: could make the Squire contemplate such a thing.\nMASTER KINCAID: 82\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 83\nDOCTOR: Squire Portillon knows about the ship. Don’t you, Squire. Just like you know there’s something very wrong with your twins!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: The twins?\nAGNES: (TO THE DOCTOR) No, Doctor! Not the children!\nDOCTOR: (TO AGNES) You said it yourself, Agnes! They were good kids! They’ve changed! Why is that?\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: (RUSHING FORWARD FROM OFF) Father!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Lucern, Finicia. This is no place for you.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: FINICIA [C17]: Please, Father. Don’t let this witch defame us so!\nDOCTOR: Finicia and Lucern were tender and merciful! Now they’re\nDOCTOR: whipping up torture and death! Don’t you wonder why?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: (URGENT) Silence him, father! His lies are so cruel!\nDOCTOR: They’re changelings! They died on Vetter’s Tor!\nDOCTOR: (TO PORTILLON) Those husks in Morris’s barn — those were your children!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (SHAKEN) W-what?\nAGNES: Doctor, please.

Lucern and I are your very flesh!\nMASTER KINCAID: Your pretty daughter is right as always, Squire. You are weak and so very malleable. (ORATING) These dogs are too dangerous to hang!

I’ve her biography here.\nALEISTER: I said, I’ve her biography [here-]\nMARY: (ABOVE) I suppose it would be. The Doctor says there are a billion books in these stacks. Although he does tend to exaggerate. (STOPS CLIMBING) Would you slide my ladder a shade to the left?\nALEISTER: Right you are. (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)\nMARY: (ABOVE) Stop!

Looks rather like that energy whatsit we saw, don’t you think?\nMARY: Show me. (READING) Hmm. It appears such an ‘energy field’ may be triggered by creatures with ‘Odic potential’.\nALEISTER: Well, what’s that when it’s at home?\nMARY: I’m not entirely sure. It appears to be a latent ability in certain especially gifted individuals. According to the Doctor, all races have people with such ‘Odic potential’ among them. (THINKING) The Doctor assumed the creature — the witch — was a survivor from a crashed Varaxil vessel.\nALEISTER: (LETS IT GO OVER HIS HEAD) Varaxil vessel. Yes. Good.\nMARY: But I begin to wonder if his conclusion was premature.\nALEISTER: (TURNS A PAGE IDLY) I don’t believe it! Look at this picture.\nMARY: A rather garish pendant or necklace. I fail to see the Significance.\nALEISTER: That ‘pendant’ is the Witches’ Star.

The very force the Varaxils use to power their world. (FX: STOPS WALKING, NOW BESIDE CONSOLE) Aleister, we are missing a vital piece of the jigsaw.\nALEISTER: Well, this volume of the Doctor’s is a load of old rot, I’m afraid.

Silver ships sailing between the stars! I want you to open your mind, Agnes. Open your mind to the visions. Please!!!\nAGNES: (RECALLING...) I see them. The silver ships. Other worlds, where jewels grow like weeds in metal meadows.\nDOCTOR: That’s it, Agnes! Hold that thought! Hold it in your mind’s eye!\nAGNES: Waterfalls... waterfalls of liquid gold...\nAGNES: (FX: CROSS TO THE CROWD — VILLAGERS JEERING. FLAMES ROARING OFF, CONSUMING THE GALLOWS. WE’RE WITH KINCAID, THE SQUIRE AND THE TWINS. AND THERE’S A WEIRD MECHANICAL ULULATION — THE VARAXIL’S SCANNER. )\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: (WHISPERED, URGENT) Sister! The WitchStar! It’s located Odic potential!\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: (SOTTO) The humans on the gallows!\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: (SOTTO) That’s not possible! We scanned them in the cells.\nAGNES: They were hollow!\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: (SOTTO) You must have misread the WitchStar.\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: (SOTTO) I was meticulous. I’m always [meticulous] —\nAGNES: 90\nAGNES: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 91\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: (SOTTO) The WitchStar Configuration is infallible. You, brother, are not!\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: (SOTTO) Then we have to save them from the flames!\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: (SOTTO) Follow my lead. (CRIES OUT) Father! Father!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (OFF) What is it, Finicia?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: FINICIA [C17]: We lied. About Agnes and Beatrix and the stranger.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (AGHAST) Lied!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: FINICIA [C17]:\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: We didn’t want to. There were demons, father — in our heads! They possessed us, preyed on our purity, made us invent such wicked lies!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: LUCERN [C17]: It’s true, father! They filled us with hate!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: FINICIA [C17]: They spoke in our dreams!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: LUCERN [C17]: In the tongues of beasts!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Are you saying you never saw Agnes consort with the Devil?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: FINICIA [C17]: They’re innocent, father! They’re all innocent!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: LUCERN[C17]: Oh father! Forgive us! Forgive your poor children!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (SHOUTS, RUNNING) Cornet! Cornet Swallow! Tell your men to\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: smother the flames. Now, before it’s too late!\nCORNET SWALLOW: (DOUBTFUL) Best check with the Witch-Pricker first...\nCORNET SWALLOW: 91\nCORNET SWALLOW: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 92\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Damn the Witch-Pricker to perdition! Hurry, man — or would you consign your soul to hell by incinerating three innocents?\nCORNET SWALLOW: Innocents? (BARKING ORDERS) You there, you heard the Squire!\nCORNET SWALLOW: There are buckets by the horse-trough!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: And give me your knife! I have to cut them free!\nALEISTER: Is this entirely wise? Shouldn’t we stay in the Doctor’s ship?\nMARY: And remain ignorant to the truth? No. What puzzles me is how the TARDIS knew we were seeking Odic energy?\nALEISTER: (FLIPPANT) Maybe it read your mind?\nMARY: (SERIOUS) Maybe it did.\nMARY: (FX: A LONG DRAWN-OUT SCREAM OF PAIN, FROM UPSTAIRS: THE WITCH)\nALEISTER: The witch!\nMARY: Upstairs. Come on!\nMARY: 92\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 93\nMARY: (FX: EVERYONE COUGHING FROM THE SMOKE. WATER SPLASHES ONTO THE FLAMES. )\nCORNET SWALLOW: Come on, you lot. Fill the buckets!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Agnes! Can you hear me? Agnes?\nAGNES: (WHEEZY, FAINT) Squire... I don’t [understand] —\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (CALLING) She’s alive! Hurry, you men! Cut the others free as well! This execution’s a monstrous misdeed!\nDOCTOR: (COUGHING HIS LUNGS UP) Not me! Get Beatrix first!\nCORNET SWALLOW: (ARRIVING BESIDE HIM) Too late for that one, sir. She’s dead. Breathed in too much smoke.\nDOCTOR: Dead? She can’t be! She’s just unconscious. (STRUGGLES TO WHERE BEATRIX LIES SLUMPED AGAINST A STAKE. STARTS SLAPPING HER FACE) Beatrix! Can you hear me? Beatrix! Beatrix!\nAGNES: (COMING UP. GENTLY) She’s gone, Doctor. Let her rest.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (TO SWALLOW) Take them to the manor, Cornet. Have my household bathe them, give them food and warm beds.\nCORNET SWALLOW: Sir!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (TO SELF) And then I shall have words with your “Witch- Pricker”!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 93\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 94\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (FX: MARY AND ALEISTER, RUNNING ON WOOD FLOORS — BOTH BREATHING HARD. THEY CAN HEAR FISTS HAMMERING ON A DOOR, UP AHEAD. MUFFLED SHRIEKS FROM THE WITCH FROM THE WELL. )\nALEISTER: (RUNNING) Second floor landing! Sounds like the creature’s caught! Thank goodness!\nMARY: (RUNNING) This is all wrong. Listen to those screams! It’s terrified! I fear we’ve misidentified the victim in this dreadful affair.\nALEISTER: (RUNNING) Just up here — (SEES LUCERN & FINICIA WAITING, SKIDS TO STOP) Woah!\nMARY: Lucern! Finicia! What in heaven’s name are you doing?\nFINICIA: We knew you were looking for us. We’re sorry we hid. Only we have a mission, you see.\nLUCERN: A sacred oath. We have to catch the witch.\nMARY: Where is she? The witch?\nFINICIA: Trapped behind that door. Caught in our Lokic web.\nFINICIA: (FX: HAMMERING GROWS WILDER. PRIMAL SHRIEKS FROM THE OTHER SIDE. )\nALEISTER: Those screams!\nMARY: What living thing can endure such pain?\nFINICIA: None. Which is why we have to take the life from it.\nMARY: You’1ll do no such thing!\nMARY: 94\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 95\nAGNES: (QUIETLY) She was dim, she was selfish — but Beatrix didn’t deserve to die. Not like that!\nDOCTOR: No-one deserves to die like that, Agnes.\nAGNES: (STARTLED) Finicia! You shouldn’t be here. If Kincaid were to [find you] -\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: But this is our home.\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: We’re the Squire’s children. Whatever the Doctor says.\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]: You birthed us, healer. You took us from our mother’s womb.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think she did rather more than that. Didn’t you, Agnes? The peasant girl and the Squire. The village gossips were right, weren’t they?\nAGNES: I don’t know what you mean, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on! This pair tried to have you burned alive, and still you don’t believe there’s a bad bone in them. Talk about maternal instinct.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: But we took their memories! How did we not know?\nAGNES: (WITH A HEAVY SIGH) The Squire’s wife didn’t die in childbirth, she died o’ the pox. But since I were pregnant by the Squire already, his poor dead wife’s ‘confinement’ were all the cover needed. When my time came, he took you from me and claimed you were hers. Better that, than for the pair of you to be branded illegitimate.\nDOCTOR: Agnes — these are not your children. They’re Varaxils.\nDOCTOR: 95\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 96\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: We took your children’s memories, Agnes Bates.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: Everything they were, we are.\nDOCTOR: Stop it! Both of you! That’s a lie and you know it! (GENTLY) I don’t think they meant to harm Finicia and Lucern, Agnes. That’s not why they came here. I think they’re here to save you.\nAGNES: Save me? No.\nAGNES: 96\nAGNES: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 97\nAGNES: (FX: THE TRAPPED WITCH’S HAMMERING BEHIND THE DOOR CONTINUES. HER SHRIEKS HAVE STOPPED, SHE’S BACK TO MUTTERING NAMES: )\nWITCH: (MUFFLED) Karavax. Neya. Illutem. Li’huan of Merkus. Rakib undead. Oluro. Narii. Nazev...\nMARY: (OVER THE WITCH) Listen to her! She’s hurt and afraid. Finicia, Lucern — come with me to the TARDIS, show me how to re-engage the controls. We’1l find the Doctor, he’1ll know what to do for the best.\nLUCERN: Do you hear, sister? She thinks the Gallifreyan will help her.\nFINICIA: Such a stupid woman. Don’t you know that without the Doctor,\nFINICIA: none of this would have happened?\nMARY: How dare you blame the Doctor for this!\nFINICIA: Be silent! We’ve waited so long to accomplish our mission.\nFINICIA: Brother, are you ready?\nLUCERN: Yes, sister.\nALEISTER: The Witches’ Star!\nWITCH: (MUFFLED, TERRIFIED) Orfak! Osidarax! Rakhi!\nFINICIA: Open the door, brother. Let’s end this.\nFINICIA: 97\nFINICIA: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 98\nDOCTOR: I should have understood when I found your crashed ship. What would a race that embraced Odic power want with a hold full of Lokic containment webs?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: You overestimate yourself, Doctor. You don’t understand at all.\nDOCTOR: Then, on the gallows, with the flames around us, it suddenly made sense: you’d sentenced us to death not because you’d detected Agnes’ higher evolution, but because you hadn't. Because I’d stupidly told her to conceal it from you. The Varaxils travel the stars in search of Odic sensitives, like that poor flux imp you took from the Pherkad array. Like Agnes.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Like our mother.\nDOCTOR: Your race knows from experience how a gift like hers inspires hate and prejudice. You vowed to save others from the same fate. So you collect them, you preserve them in stasis in your ship’s hold, you take them to your homeworld. The only planet in the galaxy where they can live free from persecution. Is that about the size of it?\nAGNES: (SO VERY SAD) Oh Doctor. You couldn’t be more wrong.\nDOCTOR: Agnes?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: The witch sees the truth, Doctor.\nAGNES: Every beast, fish and fowl across the infinity of worlds condemned their infernal engines. The Varaxils were outcasts.\nDOCTOR: (IMPATIENT) I know that.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: Yet you’ve failed to grasp what follows from that simple fact. When the universe proclaims your very existence to be abhorrent, Doctor, what then?\nDOCTOR: (DAWNING REALISATION) No...\nDOCTOR: 98\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 99\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: (SATISFACTION) Now he understands.\nAGNES: They travel the stars, Doctor, seeking souls such as mine. But they don’t want to save us.\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]: We drain their profane essence. We chain them in Lokic webs. We take them back to Varax Beta.\nDOCTOR: And you kill them.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: We’re not monsters, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: We bury them alive in tombs of reinforced tyrillium, six miles deep.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: Two centuries ago, we began by smashing the heretical machines that had made us so despised. Then we rounded up the Odic mutations among our own kind.\nAGNES: They herded them — us — into camps, Doctor. Like animals.\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]:\nAGNES: But that wasn’t enough. We had to do penance. The Varaxils had to prove beyond doubt that we had truly abandoned our sinful technologies. So we became a scourge. We swore a sacred oath: to eradicate Odic power from the cosmos.\nAGNES: FINICIA [C17]:\nAGNES: That’s what happens if you tell a race their very civilisation is an affront to creation, Doctor. Say it often enough, say it for millennia, never stop saying it...\nDOCTOR: (APPALLED) .. and finally, one day, you believe it.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: Every Varaxil has vowed to hunt down those hideous abominations, across all space and time. Isn’t that what you all wanted?\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Time to end this, Doctor. Time to kill the witch.\nDOCTOR: 99\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 100\nMASTER KINCAID: An excellent meal. My thanks for your hospitality, Squire.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: A final courtesy, nothing more. By tomorrow, I want you and your men far away from this village. There’s been a madness here since you arrived, Witch-Pricker, and it ends tonight.\nMASTER KINCAID: (POURS WINE) I’ve no wish to intrude where I’m unwelcome. But I have Parliament’s contract to fulfil. Before I leave, I must perform one last investigation.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: As long as you’re gone by dawn, I’ve no objection.\nMASTER KINCAID: Good. In that case... tell me about your children.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: My... my children?\nMASTER KINCAID: It’s a fair question. When the Doctor claimed Lucern and Finicia were changelings, you seemed almost ready to believe him. Then, the twins themselves affirmed they’d been possessed.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (QUIET) They’re all I have. Please, Witch-Pricker. This once, find mercy.\nMASTER KINCAID: Regretfully, I’ve no choice in the matter. I’1ll speak with them immediately. Pretty Finicia first, I think. I presume\nMASTER KINCAID: she’s upstairs — abed?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (OUTRAGED) You will stay away from her!\nMASTER KINCAID: (CALLING) Cornet!\nMASTER KINCAID: 100\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 101\nCORNET SWALLOW: Now sir! Settle, if you please.\nMASTER KINCAID: Be prudent, Squire. Cornet Swallow has enough blood on his\nMASTER KINCAID: hands. Don’t force him to add you to his tally.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Damn you!\nMASTER KINCAID: Make sure he stays here, Cornet. If you’1l excuse me, Squire, I’ve The Lord’s work to do.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (OFF, HELPLESS) Stay away from my daughter!\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 101\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 102\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: LUCERN [C17]: This device is a WitchStar Configuration. Our race’s highest achievement, forged in the Hecatrix Dimension.\nDOCTOR: Are you mad? Witch Dimension science is unstable in this reality. And you’re using it around Lokic fields! Don’t you know how dangerous that is?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: The WitchStar drains the blasphemous energies of our prey. With it, we can contain them safely for transport to the homeworld.\nDOCTOR: And the husks in the barn? Accidents, I suppose?\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: We had no chance to adjust the settings. All life has traces of Odic energy.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: We’d just crashed on this world. The farmer threatened us. Then we found the children.\nAGNES: (IN QUIET GRIEF) My babies.\nAGNES: LUCERN [C17]:\nAGNES: We’ll end your pain, mother. Your childrens’ essences are within the WitchStar, among a thousand other souls. You can join them.\nAGNES: (GETTING WEAKER) Doctor..!\nDOCTOR: Switch it off! Can’t you see it’s killing her?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: That’s rather the point, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]:\nDOCTOR: If our ship were intact, we’d subdue her and seal her ina Lokic web. Then we’d deliver her to Varax Beta with our other captives.\nDOCTOR: 102\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 103\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: But since we’ll not be leaving this ball of mud, we may as well kill her, here and now.\nMASTER KINCAID: (OFF) Finicia? Are you here, child? Your father has asked me to speak with you.\nDOCTOR: (YELLS) Witch-Pricker! In here!\nMASTER KINCAID: By Heaven! What devilry is this?\nDOCTOR: The pendant in the boy’s hand! Seize it!\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: No!\nMASTER KINCAID: (GRABBING IT) I have it! This is a treasure indeed. Much too good for the daughter of a village squire.\nMASTER KINCAID: FINICIA [C17]: Give it to me! You don’t know what you’re doing!\nDOCTOR: See the jewelled bead, Witch-Pricker? That’s it, now twist it. Good!\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Shut up! (HITS HIM!)\nDOCTOR: Ooof!\nDOCTOR: (FX: WITCHSTAR’S ULULATIONS DECREASE — GRADUALLY DYING AWAY. AGNES MOANS)\nDOCTOR: Agnes? Agnes? Are you all right?\nAGNES: (GASPING) So weak...\nMASTER KINCAID: A strange trinket. It seems almost infernal.\nMASTER KINCAID: 103\nMASTER KINCAID: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 104\nMASTER KINCAID: FINICIA [C17]: Please, Master Kincaid. Don’t touch the WitchStar.\nMASTER KINCAID: The pendant! I can’t let go! It’s alive in my hand!\nDOCTOR: (YELLING ABOVE THE DIN) Lucern! What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: He’s released the Odic reservoir!\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: A thousand lifeforces — set free!\nAGNES: A million stars igniting! A sea of souls!\nDOCTOR: Agnes! Stand back!\nAGNES: (IN AGONY) I know their names! Ardax! Eraktath!\nMASTER KINCAID: Doctor — the witch is aflame!\nDOCTOR: Too much power! She can’t absorb it, nothing living could! Get\nDOCTOR: out of here, before she —!\nAGNES: (FX: BOOM! THE BEDROOM — THE HOUSE — BLASTED APART! AND ABOVE IT ALL, AGNES HOWLING, BURNING WITH ODIC POWER. SHE DOESN'T\nAGNES: EVEN SOUND HUMAN ANYMORE — SHE SOUNDS LIKE THE WITCH FROM THE WELL! )\nAGNES: END OF PART THREE\nAGNES: 104\nAGNES: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 105"

Rid Tranchard’s Fell of its resident witch and your reputation grows, your name’s lauded all across the Protectorate. Who knows, you might even catch the eye of Cromwell. That’s less a holy crusade, more a career opportunity. (CALLING OUT) Whoa! We’re here.\nMASTER KINCAID: I see no wrecked freighter.\nDOCTOR: (DISMOUNTING) It’s buried.

Bates.\nDOCTOR: At peace.\nDOCTOR: 118\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 119\nMARY: (SHAKING HIM) Aleister! Aleister, speak to me!\nALEISTER: (COUGHS) Gosh, that was a heck of a bang, wasn’t it?\nMARY: Aleister! Thank heavens!\nALEISTER: Where are the twins? The Varaxi-whatsits.\nMARY: Dead, both of them.\nALEISTER: Just like that?\nMARY: I presume they were rather more sensitive than us to the energies released by the blast.\nAGNES: (DISTORTED, LIKE A DISTANT RADIO SIGNAL) Egorael. Veloog of\nAGNES: Traxis. So many voices.\nALEISTER: The witch!\nMARY: She’s alive! Help me, Aleister!\nMARY: 119\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 120\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Doctor...? Master Kincaid..? Are you here...?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Squire Portillon! You made it, then.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Where’s Master Kincaid.\nDOCTOR: He put himself in harm’s way. Fatally, I’m afraid.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: The witch! You trapped her?\nDOCTOR: Captured in the containment web.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (CALLING OFF) Cornet Swallow! Down here, sir!\nDOCTOR: She’s perfectly safe in there, Squire. She can’t hurt anyone, not any more.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: No, Doctor. It falls to me to decide the witch’s fate now.\nCORNET SWALLOW: (WALKING OVER) Sire?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Fetch the Witch-Pricker’s wagon. There’s a dry well-shaft near Morris’s farm. I would have you collect this — this cage of light, and seal it deep within the shaft.\nDOCTOR: And what if I stood in your way, Squire?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Then I would have the Cornet here put a musket-ball through your brain! (CALMER) Agnes Bates is dead. The witch killed\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: her, as it killed so many others including Master Kincaid.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 120\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 121\nDOCTOR: Who told you that? The twins?\nCORNET SWALLOW: Beg pardon, my lord. Is this yours, sir? (HE HANDS PORTILLON THE WITCHSTAR)\nDOCTOR: The WitchStar Configuration! Portillon: don’t.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (MANIPULATES THE DEVICE. IT WHIRS AND HUMS) It’s alive. What is this diabolical device, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You really ought to let me look after that.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Better, I think, that it’s locked away. I and my descendants will keep it safe, down the generations.\nDOCTOR: You’re making a mistake, Squire. If the twins should get hold of it —\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: I’1ll have other heirs in time, Doctor. The twins are my firstborn. But they won’t have this bequest.\nDOCTOR: So you do believe me?\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Lucern and Finicia are still flesh and blood to me. But... you planted doubts. I’1l never love them as once I did. (BEAT) Come along, Doctor. Let us not part enemies. Will you ride with me, back to Tranchard’s Fell?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. I need a little fresh air.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: Goodbye, then, Doctor. I, too, have no desire to linger in\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: this infernal place. Lead the way, Cornet.\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: 121\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 122\nSQUIRE PORTILLON: (FX: JUST THE WHISPER OF AN ELECTRICAL CRACKLE — THE CONTAINMENT FIELD WAS SHORTED BY THE BLAST.)\nAGNES: (DISTORTED) So much pain. So much hatred!\nMARY: (APPROACHING AGNES) It’s all right, I mean you no harm.\nALEISTER: (TO MARY) Careful, you don’t want it shorting out again.\nAGNES: (DISTORTED) Herbs, lotions, mushrooms...\nAGNES: (AGNES’ WORDS ARE AN ECHO OF HER LAST CONVERSATION WITH THE DOCTOR — LIKE A RECORD REPEATING. MARY DOESN’T REALIZE THIS)\nMARY: You want me to heal you? I can’t, I’m sorry — I don’t have the skills. Here, rest your head in my lap — (ASTONISHMENT) Oh!\nALEISTER: Bless my soul! She’s made of smoke!\nAGNES: (DISTORTED) Make them well.\nMARY: I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do!\nAGNES: (DISTORTED — VERY CLOSE) Destroy. I must give my life.\nMARY: You've been so alone, so many years. Alone in that Wel11...\nAGNES: (DISTORTED) You’ll save me, Doctor?\nMARY: I won’t leave you.\nAGNES: Nasekh. Sabaal. (VERY QUIET) Agnes... Bates.\nALEISTER: She’s gone. Whoever she was.\nALEISTER: 122\nALEISTER: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 123\nDOCTOR: That’s a jolly big stone the Squire’s men found to cover the well. Is it really necessary, or do you Varaxils just have a tendency to overdo everything?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]:\nDOCTOR: The containment web has only a residue of power since you uncoupled it from our ship. The witch will be free in days — perhaps hours. When that happens, the well-shaft won’t hold her.\nDOCTOR: But a stone seal will?\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: Not on its own.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: There are symbols. Lokic Runes, as old as time. Carved on a stone seal, they’1l confine Odic energy.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: The thing is, the runes must be precise. Perfect to the last micron. Otherwise they don’t work.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR [C17]: Ah. Well, that’s a problem for you then. Seventeenth-century stonemasonry tends to have considerably looser tolerances.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: A problem for us, Doctor. But not for you. Here.\nDOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver! I suppose I should thank you for keeping it safe. But on reflection, I won't.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: We’1ll teach you the symbols. When you carve them on the stone, this world will be protected from the witch.\nDOCTOR: One day, someone’s going to unseal the shaft. What happens then?\nDOCTOR: 123\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 124\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: You’ve seen her power. You know we can’t stand against her as she is today.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: But Varaxils live a very long time, Doctor. As seasons pass, the forces within her will fade.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: And we’ll still be here.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: When she emerges, we’ll end her life. The WitchStar Configuration will complete its task.\nDOCTOR: Really? And what if you don’t happen to have it to hand?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: (BITTER) You may have poisoned our father against us, Doctor, but we have centuries yet to discover its whereabouts.\nDOCTOR: I wish it were millennia. The thought of you roaming the Earth extracting souls with that thing chills my blood. You’ve done enough damage already.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: We have a sacred mission.\nDOCTOR: Sacred? You’ve taken the best this world has to offer and made her a ravening beast. You’ve buried her in a subterranean prison for centuries to come. And when you killed her children, you ended her line.\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: They were hollow. They were nothing.\nDOCTOR: They carried her imprint — her genetic code! Two more victims in a holocaust of witches, ages long and a universe wide. Without your interference, humanity would have taken an evolutionary leap forward.\nDOCTOR: LUCERN [C17]: You will never understand.\nDOCTOR: 124\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 125\nDOCTOR: No, I won’t. So what now? Carve the stone; seal the well; then you two sit here for hundreds of years and wait for Agnes Bates to escape?\nDOCTOR: FINICIA [C17]: If your transport doesn’t reappear, perhaps you’ll be here with us, Doctor. How fitting that would be.\nDOCTOR: The Witch-Pricker had his faith. I have mine. (BEAT) Well — are you going to show me these runes, then? The sooner I’m done here, the better.\nDOCTOR: 125\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 126\nALEISTER: But I thought you said you couldn’t fly this ‘TARDIS’?\nMARY: Ah, but I don’t have to. All I need do, I’ve realised, is place my trust in the TARDIS, and her Fast Return Switch. (WALKS TO STOP) It’s all a matter of sequential regression.\nALEISTER: Sometimes I wish I’d tried harder in science at school.\nMARY: Well, thank you, Aleister, for all your assistance. And for showing me your most interesting library.\nALEISTER: Oh. That. I’ve been thinking... The cult of the Byronic romantic: perhaps it’s all a little adolescent for a man of my standing?\nMARY: I’m foursquare with you on the issue. Although I’ve a friend who'd disagree strongly.\nALEISTER: I intend to redirect my studies to the Sixth Baron’s contemporaries.\nMARY: Percy Shelley?\nALEISTER: Possibly. Or else his wife. Which reminds me. In all the excitement, I must have accidentally pocketed... (TAKING A BOOK FROM HIS COAT) .. this.\nMARY: Mary Godwin’s biography?\nALEISTER: Ought we to return it to the TARDIS library?\nALEISTER: 126\nALEISTER: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 127\nMARY: Better, I think, that you keep it. A souvenir.\nALEISTER: I should like that. It has a very fetching frontispiece. (HE KNOWS) Besides, I feel certain the Doctor has the original — the first edition, as it were.\nMARY: Goodbye, Aleister.\nALEISTER: Goodbye...\nALEISTER: . Mary.\nALEISTER: 127\nALEISTER: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 128\nALEISTER: (FX: THE DOCTOR'S CARVING, USING HIS SONIC SCREWDRIVER. THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. DOOR OPENS. DOCTOR SWITCHES OFF SONIC)\nDOCTOR: Mary...?\nMARY: (STEPPING OUT OF TARDIS) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING FORWARD) Mary, I could kiss you-!\nMARY: Doctor!?! I’m delighted to see you also. But please, do remember I’m almost a married woman.\nDOCTOR: Yes — of course. But how on earth did you manage to pilot the TARDIS-—?\nMARY: It was all a matter of [sequential —]\nDOCTOR: . Sequential regression, yes. (FX: PATS TARDIS) Good old TARDIS. And the Varaxils? Are they still...?\nMARY: They died, Doctor. And in a most unpleasant fashion.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that was always on the cards, I’m afraid. I must say, you've been terribly resourceful, I’m extremely impressed. What happened to the witch?\nMARY: Don’t you mean ‘to Agnes Bates’?\nDOCTOR: You found out?\nMARY: (MUCH MOVED, AS SHE REMEMBERS) I tried to hold her as she faded, Doctor. Five lifetimes and more from her age. She was so weak — so sad.\nMARY: 128\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 129\nDOCTOR: Nothing here happened the way it should.\nMARY: If that’s so — then can we not change things? Can’t we spare poor blameless Agnes those centuries of imprisonment and madness?\nDOCTOR: You’ve not been with me for long, Mary. You don’t understand how this works.\nMARY: I understand that you make rules to suit yourself.\nDOCTOR: Will you walk with me? There’s something you should see. Please?\nDOCTOR: 129\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 130\nDOCTOR: (FX: WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST. LEAVES RUSTLING AS FOLIAGE IS PARTED. )\nDOCTOR: (A FLORISH) Ta-daa!\nMARY: A peasant’s cottage. What of it?\nDOCTOR: You’1l see. (FOLLOW HIM AS HE RUSHES OVER TO DOOR)\nMARY: (FOLLOWING) Doctor, it has been the longest of days. It is\nMARY: nearly dawn, and I am not in the mood for socialising!\nDOCTOR: That’s the trouble with you modern girls. No stamina.\nMARY: There’s no-one here.\nDOCTOR: Patience. Please. (KNOCKS AGAIN, CALLS OUT) Are you packed yet? You said you wanted to be the other side of the Tor before nightfall!\nAGNES: Give me a chance, Doctor. Oh, I see your lady friend’s back.\nMARY: (GOBSMACKED) Agnes?!?\nMARY: 130\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 131\nMARY: (FX: FADE UP. THE DOCTOR, MARY AND AGNES WALK. BIRDS CHIRP, THE SUN’S IN THE SKY, ALL’S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD. )\nMARY: But you said you couldn’t change events! You said you couldn’t free her from the well!\nAGNES: Whoever said I was in the well, love?\nDOCTOR: What’s trapped under the stone is the energy that Agnes absorbed from the WitchStar.\nAGNES: Glad to be rid of all that, I can tell you.\nDOCTOR: I rigged the Varaxil containment field to filter out the Odic power inside Agnes. It was tricky, I’1ll admit — I was pushed for time before the Squire plucked up courage to enter the ship. But I do like a challenge.\nMARY: And then, what? Agnes sneaked out of the vessel?\nAGNES: That’s just how it was.\nMARY: The creature kept fading and reappearing at Tranchards Folly — like mist. The twins didn’t understand why.\nDOCTOR: Well, they didn’t know that what came out of the well was just an echo patterned after its last host. An Odic waveform, already dissipating the moment it was released.\nAGNES: Whatever you say, Sir. It’s all beyond me.\nDOCTOR: At least you needn’t have to worry about the Varaxils. They won't stray far from the well for fear their ‘witch’ escapes them.\nAGNES: Aye, well. Serves them right. They always was cheeky children.\nAGNES: 131\nAGNES: DOCTOR WHO - THE WITCH FROM THE WELL by Rick Briggs Page 132\nAGNES: My route’s east to the next parish from here. I’1l bid you farewell, both o’ thee.\nDOCTOR: I wish you the very best — wherever you end up.\nMARY: Goodbye, Agnes.\nMARY: Where will she go, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: There must be hundreds of villages where she’1ll be valued more than she was in Tranchard’s Fell. Her second sight may have gone, but her ability with herbs and simples remains as strong as ever. Still, it’s a shame.\nMARY: A shame?\nDOCTOR: Humankind might have developed rather differently, had Agnes’ gift survived.\nMARY: Then I am glad, Doctor. No one should be cursed with such ‘gifts’. Prometheus stole the gift of fire from the gods and it led to war, destruction and untold misery. Unfettered, there’s no knowing what evils such powers can achieve.\nDOCTOR: Prometheus Unfettered? You might want to work on that. Come\nDOCTOR: on. It’s a long way back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR: 132"
