How’s that?\nDOCTOR: (FX KLEIN SITS. THERE IS A CLATTER OF NOISE AS THE DOCTOR\nPREPARES: TEA)\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) It was 1962 and I was researching in physics at Cambridge when I was suddenly commandeered and was taken aboard a special military airship that would fly me to Berlin. Waiting for me aboard the ship was Major Jonas Faber...\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3. INT. ZEPPELIN CONFERENCE ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP LOW BACKGROUND HUM. THE CLINK OF GLASSES, TWO\nDRINKS: BEING POURED.)\nFABER: Ah, Elizabeth, come in. Sit down. You don’t mind if I call you Elizabeth do you?\nKLEIN: Please do... Major. (SHE SITS).\nFABER: Please, call me Jonas. And I trust you will forgive me for\nFABER: sparing any blushes but may I say how beautiful you look. Freya made flesh! Will you take a drink?\nKLEIN: No thank you, Major. I’d rather you just told me what this is all about. What’s so special about me that you need to personally travel all the way from Germany to ‘recruit’ me?\nFABER: (LAUGHS) We have a new project that I am eager to get underway and your skills and experience are particularly suited to it.\nKLEIN: You’re very kind, but there are others more qualified than me.\nFABER: Bah! Qualifications are common Elizabeth but there is nothing common about you.\nFABER: In these published works of yours you demonstrate a refreshing open mindedness that most in your field of expertise invariably lack. This will be of vital importance for our work ahead. As will good working relationships too.\nKLEIN: I see... And what exactly is my new role? I was quite happy at Cambridge and my researches had reached a critical phase.\nFABER: I’m sure your colleagues will carry on your good work. But, believe me, soon your pursuits at Cambridge will seem trivial. Your horizons are about to be broadened Elizabeth. Broadened beyond the boundaries of the Earth itself.\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Ah. I see. This is some elaborate attempt to get me to give scientific plausibility for the funding of further expeditions\nKLEIN: to find the spear that penetrated Christ or the lost Ark of the Covenant..or stranded trolls from outer space?\nFABER: Let me assure you, I am only interested in facts, not fantasy. Would it surprise you to learn that the Earth has already been visited by extraterrestrials on several occasions?\nKLEIN: It would surprise me, yes.\nFABER: Yet, you yourself have speculated on th xistence of intelligent beings on other worlds. You are clearly a believer.\nKLEIN: If what you say is true, then why have I never heard about this before?\nFABER: There would be panic on the streets if the public at large believed they were under threat from alien invaders.\nKLEIN: You still haven’t answered my question. What precisely do you want me to do?\nFABER: In a government depository in Berlin are various items of extraterrestrial technology recovered from alien incursions over the years. It will be your task to unlock the secrets of these devices to further the Reich’s cause.\nKLEIN: Why now? If we’ve known of th xistence of aliens for years, why wait until now to begin research?\nFABER: Chairman Hitler was, shall we say, reluctant to acknowledge th xistence of superior alien intelligences. He decreed that\nFABER: all alien artefacts be sealed away and their existence denied. But, since his recent death, policies have changed. Hence my assignment to form this new unit. (BEAT) So Elizabeth my Freya... now you are interested, I’m sure?\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: I’m certainly... intrigued. (BEAT) You know, I think I will have that drink with you... Jonas.\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4. INT. THE TARDIS\nDOCTOR: And, of course, it was all true.\nKLEIN: Yes. Once we reached Berlin I was given access to the bunker containing the alien tech. It was incredible. Weaponry, communications devices, the remnants of space vehicles and not just from one species either, but over a dozen.\nDOCTOR: You’d be surprised how many visitors your little world has received over the centuries. But mankind has a breathtaking ability to sweep things it can’t comprehend under the carpet of history.\nKLEIN: Meeting aliens might be something you do every day, Doctor. But having long-held theories finally confirmed in reality was no small occasion for me.\nDOCTOR: And in amongst all this extraterrestrial jetsam and flotsam, you found the TARDIS.\nKLEIN: No actually. It the TARDIS. Not with Jonas.\nKLEIN: wasn’t until sometime later that I discovered until after I’d become much better acquainted\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5. INT. FABER’S HOME\nKLEIN: (SIGH’S CONTENTEDLY) Thank you, Jonas. Delicious. You are an excellent cook... for aman.\nFABER: (LAUGHS) That surprises you? Here, let me refresh your glass... and then perhaps another early night for us?\nFABER: So, any progress on the Drahvidian power core?\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) No... At least not in the sense that I actually understand it. I can get it to work; I just don’t know why it works. And until I do, I can’t duplicate it.\nFABER: Just imagine... Almost unlimited power - enough for an entire city - all in a device not much larger than a car. It could\nFABER: change the world forever.\nKLEIN: Perhaps more than you imagine. Don’t laugh but I was thinking about the possibility of it eventually being used as a power\nKLEIN: source for... well, for time travel.\nFABER: Time travel? That’s an... interesting notion. What made you\nFABER: think of that?\nKLEIN: Well... first there was obviously the utter torment of not being able to relive our first weekend in Paris together over and over again (SHARED LAUGHTER) Aside from that, temporal theory has always been of deep interest to me. It’s theoretically possible you know, but it would require a huge amount of energy to achieve. I wrote a thesis on it as part of my studies.\nFABER: Yes, I recall...\nFABER: 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Doesn’t it strike you as odd that of all the alien species that have visited Earth that we know of, none appear to have discovered time travel technology.\nFABER: Well, actually...\nKLEIN: Yes?\nFABER: There was a time traveller. In fact he was instrumental in us winning the war?\nKLEIN: What?! That’s incredible!\nFABER: And also highly confidential. I’m only telling you because I know I can trust you to keep it to yourself.\nKLEIN: Of course. But tell me more...\nFABER: In 1944, two people from the future, a man and a girl, arrived at Colditz castle. The girl, ‘Ace’, was executed and the man, known only as ‘the Doctor’ escaped in his time machine. But he left behind a small device that contained what we now know as a laser.\nKLEIN: Laser tech came from the future! I knew there was something odd about the speed of that breakthrough. Especially considering its importance.\nFABER: From the laser w ventually developed nuclear weapons.\nKLEIN: Allowing us to bomb New York and Moscow, forcing the surrender and winning us the war.\nFABER: Precisely. To be honest, without those nuclear strikes, things may not have gone so well for the Reich.\nKLEIN: Such a shame that the time machine itself was lost. At least it confirms time travel is possible. How exciting!\nKLEIN: 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nFABER: Actually, it isn’t lost. We have the machine in a high security bunker.\nKLEIN: What?\nFABER: Stupidly for him, the Doctor returned to Germany ten years later. His time ship appeared next to a border crossing check- point in the west. He ignored warnings from the troopers who saw him raise a rifle. They gunned him down. He was killed instantly. The odd thing was though, that when the guards inspected the corpse they discovered what they believed to have been a rifle was in fact just an old umbrella.\nFABER: (FX: UNDER THE ABOVE SPEECH WE HEAR THE TARDIS MATERIALISE ON A RAINY NIGHT. THE DOOR OPENS. FOOTSTEPS IN THE MUD. GUARDS\nSHOUT: ‘STOP, OR WE FIRE’. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE. THERE IS GUNFIRE. THE DOCTOR CRIES OUT AND HIS BODY HITS THE GROUND)\nKLEIN: Curious. But the machine... Why have I not been given access to it along with the other alien technology?\nFABER: Elizabeth, the thing makes me feel..uneasy.\nKLEIN: Why?\nFABER: You have clearly studied the science and theory of time travel, but have you considered the implications of actually using such a machine?\nKLEIN: You mean changing history?\nFABER: Yes, in the wrong hands, even the smallest interference with past events might result in catastrophic changes to the world we live in today.\nFABER: 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6. INT. THE TARDIS\nDOCTOR: Jonas was right. Time travelling does carry great responsibility.\nKLEIN: How hypocritical of you, considering that you claim that it was your own carelessness that created my timeline.\nDOCTOR: Even I make mistakes.\nKLEIN: Which is why you came back in 1955? To try and set things right?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t know about that. For me that hasn’t happened.\nKLEIN: If it had, you would still be dead. You should be dead.\nDOCTOR: You’re too kind! Anyway, thanks to you Klein, I’m not dead.\nKLEIN: I should have listened to Jonas. If I had, I would still be there with him now. Instead, it’s all gone... Just a memory...\nDOCTOR: So, how did you convince Jonas to give you access to the TARDIS?\nKLEIN: After Hitler’s death in 1961, the succeeding ruling body was soon weakened by divisions and internal conflict. A time machine would literally have the power to shape the future and guarantee the supremacy of the Reich - on Earth and perhaps beyond...\nKLEIN: 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. INT. FABER’S HOME.\nKLEIN: Just think what we could achieve with a time machine, Jonas. We could avert threats to the stability of the Reich before they had even occurred.\nFABER: In principal it sounds attractive, of course. But the risks would be too great. The damage that could be done.\nKLEIN: If operated carefully and responsibly, the risks would be minimal. Do you really want to watch our world destroyed by in-fighting? The Reich still has enemies, they are just waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. And, of course, there is the potential threat from aliens...\nFABER: I don’t know, Elizabeth...\nKLEIN: And, of course, those who control such a machine would be held in the highest regard. You and I, Jonas. We could be heralded as the saviours of the Reich. You are a Major now, but with this time machine, you might one day even be the Fuhrer.\nFABER: That’s... that’s just a fantasy, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: Is it? Think about it... At least give me access to the\nKLEIN: Doctor’s machine. Allow me to study it, to understand its operating principles.\nKLEIN: (NARRATING)\nKLEIN: And, of course, reluctantly he did. It took some arm twisting - sometimes literally. Eventually though, the TARDIS was exhumed from the secret bunker where it had remained hidden for years and was brought to my laboratory. My excitement quickly disappeared though, when I discovered that couldn’t even gain access to the machine. The door was locked and I had no key. I tried to drill the lock but it was no use. High-speed, diamond tipped drills didn’t even leave a scratch. However, my attempts to force an entry did activate some kind of distress call, no doubt to alert you had you still been alive to receive it.\nKLEIN: (FX: UNDER THE ABOVE SPEECH WE HEAR A DRILL AS IT TRIES TO PENETRATE THE TARDIS LOCK. AFTER A MOMENT A SHRILL ALARM SOUND\nKLEIN: 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nCAN: BE HEARD WHICH CONTINUES AFTER THE DRILL STOPS AND THEN FADES OUT)\nCAN: And then, I realised you must have been carrying the key when you were shot. Immediately I requested access to your remains only to learn that soon after the shooting, your corpse had\nCAN: been stolen.\nCAN: 15\nCAN: SCENE\nDOCTOR: Stolen, eh? Why, I wonder, corpse? I’m much more fun when I’m alive.\nKLEIN: Apparently it was assumed the corpse of a time\nKLEIN: that\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: would someone want to steal my\nDOCTOR WHO: to be trophy hunters. I dare say traveller would make for a rather\nDOCTOR WHO: unique exhibit in an eccentric’s collection. Perhaps they had you stuffed?\nDOCTOR: How flattering.\nKLEIN: So, without the key to the our plans. But it wasn’t long before new hope presented\nTESEL: iiavc\nTARDIS: I had no hope of realising\nTARDIS: 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9. INT.

How did you get this number?\nSCHMIDT: (DISTORT) Doctor Klein, we need to meet. I have something that I think might be of interest to you.\nKLEIN: Who is this? You have no business phoning here. I can have this call traced -\nSCHMIDT: (DISTORT) My name is Schmidt. Johan Schmidt. You have in your possession a time machine do you not?\nKLEIN: T -\nSCHMIDT: (DISTORT) ..-And I have in my possession the key to that time machine.\nKLEIN: (SLOWLY) What... Is this some kind of joke? Is Major Faber behind this?\nSCHMIDT: Major who?\nKLEIN: What..what is it you are after? Money?\nSCHMIDT: (DISTORT)\nSCHMIDT: I’m not interested in money, Doctor. I just want to help you. Meet me at the Cafe Berio on MaakenstraBke at eleven tonight. You’ll be quite safe.\nSCHMIDT: 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: (NARRATING)\nKLEIN: I reasoned that he must be telling the truth about possessing the key. There was no other way he could have known about it. But how did he find me and how did he know I had the TARDIS? I was desperate to gain access to the ship and this seemed to be\nKLEIN: my only hope. So, despite my fears, I decided I would go.\nKLEIN: 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. INT. CAFE BERIO\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: IT IS RAINING. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH AND STOP.

Sorry to drag you out on a night like this. Sit down please. Can I get you something to drink?\nSCHMIDT: I prefer tea myself, but I gather the cappuccino is excellent.\nKLEIN: No thank you. I didn’t come here to socialise.\nSCHMIDT: No. You came here for this...\nKLEIN: That’s it? The key?\nSCHMIDT: Yes. The key to your time machine. Or should I say, the Doctor’s time machine.\nKLEIN: How do you know about the Doctor? Where did you get the key? Was it you who stole the Doctor’s body?\nSCHMIDT: (SMALL LAUGH) In a manner of speaking, yes.\nKLEIN: How do I know this is the real key?\nSCHMIDT: Take it. Try it out. I guarantee it will open the lock.\nKLEIN: You mean... you’re just going to give it to me?\nSCHMIDT: I am. Yes.\nSCHMIDT: 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: You want nothing in return?\nSCHMIDT: Nothing.\nKLEIN: I don’t understand...\nSCHMIDT: You are going to do great things with your life Elizabeth, marvellous things. And I am offering you my services should you need them. That key will give you access to the time machine but you will then have to deduce the operating procedures. Could be tricky on your own...\nKLEIN: And what makes you so qualified...?\nSCHMIDT: Qualifications are common Dr Klein. What you need is someone with some insight into temporal mechanics.. It has been an interest of mine for quite a few years now. I’ve picked up some useful bits of know-how here and there. Copenhagen..and other places...\nKLEIN: Even if that’s true, why would you want to help me?\nSCHMIDT: Isn’t it obvious? You possess the only known time machine on the planet. For a man with my interests, the chance to examine such a machine is irresistible.\nKLEIN: I see. Well... thank you for the offer. I’1ll1 let you know.\nSCHMIDT: Excellent. I’1ll be here at the same time next Thursday. See\nSCHMIDT: lizabeth...\nSCHMIDT: you then, El]\nSCHMIDT: 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: And the key fitted the TARDIS lock?\nKLEIN: Of course. As soon as I got back from my meeting with Schmidt, I tried it. I don’t know what I expected to find inside, but\nKLEIN: TLO‘Es asi\nDOCTOR: Bigger on the inside than the outside...\nKLEIN: Yes. Quite. Suddenly I fully appreciated that I was dealing with technology far in advance of our own. If Schmidt really could help, I was going to need him.\nDOCTOR: But you had your doubts about him?\nKLEIN: Of course. He’d more-or-less admitted to stealing your body.\nDOCTOR: What did Schmidt look like?\nKLEIN: Young. Tall with long dark hair. Handsome in a gothic sort of way. Why do you ask?\nDOCTOR: Oh, just curious... So, despite your reservations, you enlisted Schmidt’s help?\nKLEIN: Jonas wasn’t happy, of course. But, with some persuasion, he came to realise that any possibility that Schmidt might help was worth pursuing. So, the following week, I returned to Cafe Berio, but this time Jonas and an escort accompanied me...\nKLEIN: 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12. INT. CAFE BERIO.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE CAFE DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES. TWO SOLDIERS MARCH IN\nACCOMPANIED: BY KLEIN AND FABER)\nSCHMIDT: Good evening Elizabeth. I see you’ve brought some friends with vou.\nKLEIN: This is Major Faber...\nFABER: What are you up to, Schmidt?\nSCHMIDT: I’m not up to anything, Major. I’m only interested in the pursuit of science.\nFABER: I find that quite difficult to believe. There is no record of anyone by your name matching your description. You are a non- person. A grave-robber. A criminal. Are you from Romany stock?\nKLEIN: Jonas...\nFABER: However... You have suggested to Doctor Klein here that you might possibly be able to assist her in her researches. I am doubtful of this myself, but it would be foolish of me not to explore all avenues in pursuit of this important work.\nSCHMIDT: You won’t regret it Major.\nFABER: For your sake I had better not. You will come with us now and tomorrow you will begin your work. You will be under armed guard at all times. Should Doctor Klein report that you are making no significant contribution to her work, you will be dealt with accordingly. Guards. Escort this man to the ‘guest’ quarters that have been prepared for him.\nSCHMIDT: (AS HE IS LEAD AWAY, OUT OF THE CAFE) Thank you Major. See you in the morning Elizabeth! Bright and early!\nSCHMIDT: 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nFABER: I hope we are doing the right thing, Elizabeth. I don’t like him. I feel he is... almost mocking us. I don’t like the idea of him working so closely with you.\nKLEIN: You have taken precautions. I will be fine. If he can help me, and for some reason I believe that he can, we could soon be realising our plans. (THE SOUND OF KISSING) Come on. Let’s go home and drink to our destiny. A destiny we can shape ourselves.\nKLEIN: 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: And was Schmidt as helpful as you hoped?\nKLEIN: Yes. He was. We made good progress. He seemed able to make the leap of faith into the unknown that eludes so many scientists. We were of the same mind, I think.\nDOCTOR: And, if I recall correctly from what you told me before, that’s when you discovered the TARDIS travel log?\nKLEIN: Yes, we theorised that it should be possible to return the ship to destinations that it had most recently visited. But navigation and independent flight eluded us. Jonas strictly forbade me from attempting any journey until I was confident of being able to pilot the ship back home.\nDOCTOR: So, what finally prompted you return with the TARDIS to 1944?\nKLEIN: Well, now I think about it, it was something that Schmidt said...\nKLEIN: 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. OLD TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: (NOTE THAT THIS TARDIS SHOULD BE THE ORIGINAL McCOY ERA TV TARDIS)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS CONTROLS ARE OPERATED FOLLOWED BY SOME DISCORDANT BLEEPS)\nKLEIN: Ohhhh.... That’s a negative on test twenty-three. I was sure we were on the right path this time.\nSCHMIDT: Hmmmm... we do seem to keep hitting dead ends don’t we? How frustrating!\nKLEIN: If only we could stumble upon an instruction manual! Even if we did what are the chances of it being written in German?\nSCHMIDT: (LAUGHTER) For all we know perhaps this panel on the console is a Ouija board! At least we could then ask the Doctor about the vessel’s operation from beyond the grave! (LAUGHING) (BEAT) It’s such a shame the Doctor was killed.\nKLEIN: (GASP) That’s it! Oh... how can we have been so stupid?! The Doctor isn’t dead!\nSCHMIDT: What?\nKLEIN: In 1944 he’s still alive. We know how to access the travel log and return the ship back along its previous flight path...\nSCHMIDT: Ahhhh...So we could travel back to Colditz in 1944, collect the Doctor and force him to explain the operating procedures of his ship.\nKLEIN: Exactly. Yes. That has to be the way.\nSCHMIDT: That’s brilliant Elizabeth! Now you’re beginning to think like a time traveller.\nKLEIN: (NARRATING) But Jonas was less enthusiastic...\nKLEIN: 2\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. INT. FABER’S OFFICE\nFABER: Are you out of your mind, Elizabeth?!!\nKLEIN: But Jonas it’s the only way. With the Doctor under our control, we could gain access to the time machine’s full capabilities.\nFABER: No! It is out of the question! Even if you were accompanied by a battalion of storm troopers there is no guarantee that you would even find the Doctor.\nKLEIN: Of course we would. It’s a matter of historical record. We know exactly where and when the Doctor is.\nFABER: Even so, he might refuse to assist you even if it meant his own death. Then you would be stranded. Trapped in the past. Unable to return to the here and now. To me...\nKLEIN: No. The machines log should record the journey and we can use it to return here.\nFABER: You can’t be certain of that. And don’t forget that your very\nFABER: presence there would be interfering with the past. A moment in history that could well have been the crucial turning point in the war. If that laser device was lost or damaged as a result\nFABER: of your presence, it could have disastrous consequences.\nFABER: 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: Jonas was right, wasn’t he? As a direct result of your\nDOCTOR: intervention, Ace’s CD player and the laser it contained never\nDOCTOR: fell into Nazi hands. Germany lost the war and history followed its natural course.\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) Yes, I know that now, of course. I was so determined to secure a glorious future for the Reich and for Jonas and myself. I took a gamble with time...\nDOCTOR: And lost.\nKLEIN: Yes. (BEAT) I would do anything to change the decision that I made next. I could still be there.... With him...\nDOCTOR: We all have to take personal responsibility for our actions. (BEAT) Go on, finish your story...\nKLEIN: (DEEP BREATH) I went back to the lab and dismissed Schmidt’s guard, sending him on some fool’s errand. Then I told Schmidt that we were going to defy Jonas and make the journey anyway...\nKLEIN: 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. KLEIN’S LABORATORY\nSCHMIDT: You are a brave woman, Elizabeth. I told you that you would do great things.\nKLEIN: Straight there. Straight back. I have a gun and even with just the two of us, I am confident we can apprehend the Doctor. We\nKLEIN: will return to the exact moment that we left. Jonas won’t even know we made the trip until we are back.\nSCHMIDT: Elizabeth, you will have to make this journey alone. I can’t go with you.\nKLEIN: But... Why? This is what we’ve been working towards all along. I need you with me.\nFABER: (DISTANT) No, you don’t Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: (GASP) Jonas...\nFABER: (APPROACHING) Schmidt, step away from her.\nSCHMIDT: Put the gun down, Major. I don’t pose any threat to you, I am only -\nSCHMIDT: (FX: TWO GUN SHOTS. SCHMIDT CRYS OUT AND COLLAPSES, GASPING TO THE FLOOR)\nKLEIN: Jonas! What have you done?!\nFABER: Just after you left my office, I finally received an intelligence report on ‘Johan Schmidt’. It’s not his real name of course. He has many names. It seems that for several years now, he has been assisting political prisoners to escape justice and has been actively undermining the Reich’s ethnic\nFABER: cleansing programmes. Elizabeth, you have been colluding with a traitor and a criminal.\nFABER: 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSCHMIDT: (GASPING FOR BREATH) No, it’s not true, Elizabeth. He’s just jealous. Jealous of our relationship and our successes. Don’t listen to him. Get in the TARDIS and go!\nKLEIN: TARDIS?\nSCHMIDT: The... the time machine.\nFABER: No Elizabeth. This man has tricked you. There will be no more time experiments. I’m having this machine taken back to its vault where it can stay forever.\nKLEIN: No, Jonas. This is our chance. Our chance to take control. To lead. Together at each other’s side.\nFABER: Don’t do it, Elizabeth. I love you. And if you love me, you won’t get in that machine. Its cursed! I told you it made me feel uneasy.\nFABER: (THERE IS A ROAR FROM SCHMIDT AS HE LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT FABER. THE TWO FALL TO THE GROUND FIGHTING.)\nSCHMIDT: Do it Elizabeth. Go! You have to!!\nKLEIN: I do love you, Jonas. And that’s why I must go. Soon you will be Fuhrer.\nKLEIN: (FX: THE EXTERNAL DOOR TO THE TARDIS OPENS AND CLOSES.

TARDIS\nKLEIN: (TO HERSELF) If only I’d listened to Jonas and not Schmidt.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps Schmidt saw the bigger picture?\nKLEIN: Like you, you mean? (BEAT) He said ‘TARDIS’.\nDOCTOR: What?\nKLEIN: Just after Jonas shot him, Schmidt called it the TARDIS. I’d forgotten that. It meant nothing to me. I had never heard that name until I met you. (HAUNTED) How on Earth could Schmidt know it...?\nDOCTOR: The memory cheats! Perhaps your memory is playing tricks with you? I used to think Professor X was better in the 60s until I went back and watched it again..Even Vault Of The Cyborgs!\nKLEIN: No, I know what I heard. He definitely said TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: (NERVOUSLY) Anyway, it’s all in the past now! Well, ‘a’ version of the past...’ Your’ past to be precise.\nKLEIN: (UNEASY, ALMOST TALKING TO HERSELF NOT LISTENING TO THE DOCTOR) How could Schmidt have known? Yet another thing to haunt me for the rest of my life! I can’t let it go. Somehow I just ‘know’ that its important. I can ‘feel’ it..\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS RESIGNED) If it feels that important to you..then I suppose you should know.\nKLEIN: Know what?\nDOCTOR: From my point of view, it never happened, but I suspect I know what I planned. Hearing your account confirms it.\nKLEIN: What do you mean? What are you talking about?\nKLEIN: 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: My ‘death’ was no accident. I arranged it. In actual fact I didn’t die at all.\nKLEIN: Ridiculous. You were gunned down. Riddled with bullets. Nobody could survive that.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but a Time Lord could. What, for a human would be certain death for me simply triggered a regeneration. My body wasn’t stolen, it got up and walked away. Literally a new man.\nKLEIN: Regeneration? Surely that’s impossible. What new man?\nDOCTOR: Young. Tall with long dark hair. Handsome in a gothic sort of way...\nKLEIN: I think I’m going to be sick. (PAUSE)\nKLEIN: (HORRIFIED) Schmidt!? You are saying that Schmidt... was you?!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so Klein. I apologise for the deception, even though I never carried it out. Multiple potential realities make even me giddy!\nKLEIN: Schmidt... you, were manipulating me all along. It was all an elaborate trick to make me go back to 1944. To change history.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS has no travel logs. My future self must have set that up to ensure you went back to exactly the right point in space and time. By working with you he was gently guiding you along, ensuring you made that journey.\nKLEIN: (FURIOUS) You used me!\nDOCTOR: Yes... I couldn’t make the journey myself as I would have been crossing my own time track. I really am sorry Klein. You are a victim of my mistake. But, I have a responsibility to repair any damage to the web of time —- particularly when I myself caused that damage.\nDOCTOR: 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: (FURIOUS) All this time... I blamed myself for what happened. My entire world is gone! The people I knew and loved. Jonas. All erased! I thought it was my fault! But really... all along... I have just been a pawn in this cosmic game of yours.\nDOCTOR: I’m not proud of my actions. But they were necessary.\nKLEIN: (LONG PAUSE) Very well. Fine. That’s fine. I understand Doctor. You clearly did what you thought you had to. You saw the bigger picture.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) Yes. Thank you Elizabeth. I must say, that’s very gracious of you.\nKLEIN: I’m learning Doctor. Like you suggested. Onwards and upwards. What’s past is past. We can’t risk unravelling the Universe can we!\nDOCTOR: No. Maybe I’ve underestimated you Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: Not to worry. We live and learn Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah! We’ve arrived. Your first alien world!\nDOCTOR: Outside those doors lies a whole new perspective for you. You can gaze upon a glittering galaxy your civilisation never knew xisted. Let alien sand run through your fingers. Watch strange new life forms whirling in a different sky...\nKLEIN: I can’t wait.

Who knows what we’ll find here.\nDOCTOR: Maybe travel is broadening your mind.\nKLEIN: (vaguely sarcastic) All thanks to your ‘education’, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (puckish) It’s quite a nice cave, don’t you think?

Hmmm....\nLILY: Have you found something, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well, Rose. It’s more about what I’m not finding. You see... well, maybe you can’t. But whatever killed your predecessors didn’t hurt them.

We are too close!\nDOCTOR: It won’t hurt the eggs. It’s only trouble is with... well, anything else that moves.\nLILY: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: The Carrion hatched first. It’s the oldest surviving Vrill. It must have hatched while the gas was still in the air.\nLILY: This “gas” is the Winterlack weapon?\nDOCTOR: Yes. No wonder you’ve been able to evade the Carrion for so long. It hasn’t been on our trail at all. It has been wandering the corridors at random. It can only go on what it sees.\nDOCTOR: Lily...?\nLILY: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: There’s something alive inside this egg!\nDOCTOR: 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: So tell me, Steffen, what are you doing injecting nerve gas into the centre of the Vrill nest?\nSTEFFEN: You appear to know quite a lot about these aliens.\nKLEIN: These “aliens” as you call them are the native species on this planet. And one that you humans are busy exterminating.\nSTEFFEN: It’s kill or be killed on this planet. Creatures like your friend are why we are now down to just two of us.\nKLEIN: This is the place. This is where they had their little encounter. S the broken branches, the scuffed earth.\nSTEFFEN: So what? The native life forms are dangerous.\nKLEIN: The native life forms are terrified! Of you! Did you try communicating with them?\nSTEFFEN: (scoffing) Ha-ha! I don’t have time for this. Come back when y— ow! OW!\nSTEFFEN: Hey! Let go of me...\nKLEIN: (effort) If a headlock’s what it takes... Now down on your knees!\nSTEFFEN: I’m warning you, Klein!\nKLEIN: Warn away. Smell the ground.\nSTEFFEN: You have got to be kidd—\nKLEIN: I am deadly serious! Tell me what you can smell!\nKLEIN: 83\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Er.. burning toast... that’s weird... why do I smell burning toast...\nKLEIN: Go on...\nSTEFFEN: Er... carpet.. lilies, maybe...\nROSE: (faint) Distress...\nSTEFFEN: Did you say something?\nKLEIN: No, Steffen. I did not.\nROSE: (faint) Distress... distress...\nKLEIN: Now can you hear it?\nSTEFFEN: What’s going on?\nKLEIN: The Vrill communicate by scent markers. When you shot this one, she put clouds of invisible pheromones into the air.\nSTEFFEN: Saying “distress”?\nKLEIN: Saying “help me”! Saying “why are they hurting me?” Saying: “Danger!”\nSTEFFEN: But how can I “hear” it if it’s communicating by smell. What the hell’s going on?\nKLEIN: Just trust me: right now, you and the Vrill will be able to understand each other. You’ll hear their signals as words, and they will hear your words as...\nSTEFFEN: Smells? This is ludicrous. This is utterly ludicrous.\nSTEFFEN: 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Really? I’ve just proved it to you haven’t I?\nSTEFFEN: But... how come I have never noticed this before...? Ohh... Ohh... I get it. Is this some sort Geopolice experiment?\nKLEIN: I... (ahem)... I am not authorised to discuss classified matters.\nSTEFFEN: That’s why this world is closed off. You’re experimenting with some sort of xeno-communication deal here.\nKLEIN: Had it occurred to you that this world is closed off because it is not possible to communicate with the natives?\nSTEFFEN: But now it is possible? How did this happen? Why can I suddenly hear what they are saying?\nKLEIN: The whole forest will talk to you, if you just use your nose.\nKLEIN: 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MORE SHUFFLING BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE EGG. DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE CARRION MOVING AROUND)\nDOCTOR: Lily, I thought you said that the eggs wouldn’t hatch.\nLILY: I said that there would be no more Vrill like me.\nDOCTOR: What’s this one? What’s this one that’s trying to get out..? The egg is so huge that I can only imagine...\nLILY: It is a Warrior Vrill, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And when a Vrill hatches, it is ready for anything? Awake? Adult...?\nLILY: That is correct.\nDOCTOR: Then that’s what we need. A Warrior Vrill on our side!\nLILY: It has not yet hatched.\nDOCTOR: It’s knocking on the egg, it’s trying to get out.\nLILY: Yes Doctor, hatching is imminent.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s help it!\nDOCTOR: 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Typical Geopolice. Barging in wherever you feel like it, claiming to represent the interests of indigenous life-forms.\nKLEIN: Since you are killing them off, you clearly don’t care yourself. I don’t care who’s the inferior race, here. I care that there is an entire alien civilisation that can be studied!\nSTEFFEN: Please, Klein. If you are from the Geopolice, we can work something out.\nKLEIN: Can we?\nSTEFFEN: We are not invaders. We are... colonists.\nKLEIN: There are only two of you! How long do you expect your new society to endure?\nSTEFFEN: Obviously, Klein, we are the advance party. The other colonists will come after us.\nKLEIN: Once you have wiped out the dominant species on this planet.\nSTEFFEN: The Vrill are dangerous. They attacked us.\nKLEIN: Would that be before or after you invaded their world and started shooting at anything that moved?\nSTEFFEN: Klein, my home world is drastically overcrowded. It was never intended for long-term habitation.\nKLEIN: What’s your point?\nSTEFFEN: The air is dirty, the food is getting more toxic by the day. There is no privacy, no nature... My home world is a slum.\nSTEFFEN: 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: So find another.\nSTEFFEN: Which brings me... here!\nKLEIN: This planet is taken. Look up in the sky, Steffen. There is an entire galaxy there!\nSTEFFEN: This world is the nearest and the best for us. We need the... what’s the word...?\nKLEIN: Lebensraum.\nSTEFFEN: I’m sorry?\nKLEIN: Living space. You’ve bred like rabbits and taken everything you can get from your home world, and now you want to take it from everyone else.\nSTEFFEN: You make us sound like we’re the bad guys.\nSTEFFEN: 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: (effort) Come on! Crack! Open!\nLILY: Doctor, what you are doing is not ordained.\nDOCTOR: (effort) If it saves our lives, it’s ordained enough for me!\nLILY: The egg must hatch itself, without aid. It will hatch in time.\nDOCTOR: (effort) Time is one thing we don’t have, Lily! I need something to cut the outer membrane... Ah yes...\nLILY: What is that? It looks Winterlack...\nDOCTOR: No Lily, it’s just the key to my TARDIS! Just a key...\nLILY: What does it do?\nLILY: (FX: DOCTOR STABS KEY INTO THE EGG, RIPPING ALONG THE\nMEMBRANE: )\nDOCTOR: It opens things. Come on, Lily!\nLILY: It is not ordained!\nDOCTOR: Help me open this egg, if you want to live!\nDOCTOR: 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: We just don’t have the resources to search furt suitable inhabited world. Not without help. But won’t do that, will you?\nSTEFFEN: her out for a you Geopolice\nSTEFFEN: (T CT\nKLEIN: Won’t we?\nSTEFFEN: No, you'll interfere. You’1l tell us where we can go. Where we can’t go. But if we don’t meet your requirements for civilisation, you won’t actually help us.\nKLEIN: Ah, Untermensch. I shall enjoy mentioning this to the Doctor.\nSTEFFEN: What?\nKLEIN: You are, if you will forgive me, Steffen. You are an inferior race. The Geopolice will not help you. You must help yourself.\nSTEFFEN: Your big Non-interference Policy cuts both ways, Klein, you mark my words. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot and in need of my help...\nKLEIN: Yes?\nSTEFFEN: I’1l be sure not to you alive.\nSTEFFEN: Nv\nSTEFFEN: ‘interfere” while some alien lifeform eats\nSTEFFEN: 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: (effort)\nDOCTOR: Right now, Lily, it just cuts open the membrane. That’s all. There!\nBUTTERFLY: I am alive. I am ready. I am ready!\nDOCTOR: Good! We need your help.\nBUTTERFLY: I am reporting for duty.\nDOCTOR: We are in danger.\nBUTTERFLY: Are you the Authority?\nDOCTOR: Erm... IT am a friend. Tell it, Lily.\nLILY: The Doctor is our friend, the Carrion is trying to kill us.\nBUTTERFLY: Is the Carrion our enemy?\nDOCTOR: Sadly it is. And we cannot stop it.\nBUTTERFLY: I am a Warrior Vrill. I shall protect you.\nLILY: Doctor! The Carrion approaches.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Lily!\nBUTTERFLY: Protect the Vrill!\nBUTTERFLY: 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nCARRION: New intruder detected.\nLILY: Doctor, why are we not running...? Now is our chance.\nDOCTOR: Because it’s over, Lily. It’s already over.\nLILY: But there is still danger...\nDOCTOR: The Carrion has given everything it could. It was already weakened. This new hatchling only has to deliver the killing blow.\nBUTTERFLY: Protect the nest.\nCARRION: Kill the intruder... distress... distress... alone.\nLILY: The Carrion is gone?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Lily. Poor thing...\nLILY: You mourn an enemy.\nDOCTOR: Was it really our enemy, Lily? It didn’t stand a chance. Born in agony, its wings malformed, its senses dulled, all alone in the nest...\nLILY: It tried to kill us!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Lily, but only because it grew up alone and friendless. Unaware of any other Vrill. Thinking that everything it saw, even a fellow Vrill, was an intruder.\nDOCTOR: 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: I think I understand...\nDOCTOR: That was why it had to die...\nBUTTERFLY: The Carrion is defeated. I await orders.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, my protector! Thank you for saving us!\nBUTTERFLY: I protect the nest. It is my duty.\nDOCTOR: I suppose we need a name for you, too. Hmm... you are a beautiful creature..! The Carrion’s wings were never quite\nDOCTOR: developed... or maybe damaged in a dozen battles. But yours... yours are magnificent.\nDOCTOR: “Butterfly”.\nDOCTOR: 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Just one Vrill is strong enough to tear apart a platoon of armed soldiers.\nKLEIN: This is a military operation?\nSTEFFEN: This is pest control.\nKLEIN: These are not rats in a barn. They are sentient creatures.\nSTEFFEN: How do you know?\nKLEIN: I pay attention. Which is more than you have done if you haven’t been listening to what the Vrill are broadcasting.\nSTEFFEN: That is, admittedly a new development.\nKLEIN: New? It is the beginning of a new epoch! Don’t you see? Now you can talk to the Vrill. You can negotiate with them.\nSTEFFEN: Somehow I don’t think that’s going to work.\nKLEIN: But you won’t even try!?\nSTEFFEN: It’s survival of the fittest, Klein. We are the Master Race here.\nKLEIN: Ah... uh...\nSTEFFEN: Are you all right?\nKLEIN: Yes... yes... I... well, it’s been a while since I heard that term. I never really expected to hear it from... someone else.\nKLEIN: 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Humanity is the inheritor of nature, its master, its warden. We should be able to treat it as we please.\nSTEFFEN: 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nROSE: Sister, can you hear? Lily, are you there?\nROSE: There is no signal from the Carrion. Somewhere in the nest, the Carrion has been defeated.\nROSE: BUTTERFLY (approaching/distant) Find the one called Klein... Find the one called Klein... Searching for the one called Klein...\nROSE: Something approaches. Welcome, new hatchling, welcome to the nest...\nROSE: BUTTERFLY (dopplers right past) Find the one called Klein... Find the one called Klein... Searching for the one called Klein...\nROSE: Where are you going? Why are you heading outside. Under what Authority? Who commands you?\nROSE: 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: So this is how a colonial operation works, Steffen? Two men and a ship full of weapons-grade chemicals. Drop out of the sky, kill off the locals and everything’s ready for the settlers.\nSTEFFEN: You sound surprised. You must have seen things like this before.\nKLEIN: There are still Vrill left alive, you know.\nSTEFFEN: I know. And nerve gas isn’t cheap.\nKLEIN: So how do you know when they are all dead and it’s safe for you to move in?\nSTEFFEN: There’1l be a few stragglers hatching after the attack. But they won’t last. We wait to see no movement on the readouts.\nKLEIN: The readouts?\nSTEFFEN: Behind you.\nKLEIN: This.. is an image of the Vrill’s hive? I can see all the passages.\nSTEFFEN: Yes, we’ve put geophysics units in a grid for a three mile radius.\nKLEIN: So this is live?\nSTEFFEN: Yes. We can’t really get much in terms of life readings, but we can get the tunnels and the major heat sources.\nSTEFFEN: 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: I’m seeing one heat source: one huge heat source, right here at the centre.\nSTEFFEN: That’s the heart of the nest.\nKLEIN: The Hatching Yard?\nSTEFFEN: There’s some sort of isotope or volcanic extrusion at the lowest point of the nest.\nKLEIN: Yes, there’s a huge underground lake of boiling nutrients. It incubates the eggs.\nSTEFFEN: How about that!\nKLEIN: You didn’t know? You know enough about the Vrill’s social structure to gas their entire nest, but you don’t know how their nest works?\nSTEFFEN: Our camera gave us what we needed to know. Eggs in the Hatching Yard along with nutrient pods. Thousands of them. Although without any Vrill Workers to tend to them, I guess they’ re sitting around now.\nSTEFFEN: 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: Now what do we do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ve sent Butterfly to find Klein and bring her back safe.\nLILY: If she is still alive.\nDOCTOR: She will be if she listened to me.\nLILY: What did you tell her to do?\nDOCTOR: I told her to.. well, Lily. These Vrill orders... they overpower you when you’re all yelling together, but out in the open, the\nDOCTOR: Signal strength dissipates quite fast.\nLILY: (doubtful) Oh, I... see.\nDOCTOR: Besides, the Vrill’s idea of removing a danger is simply to throw it out of the nest. Klein will be somewhere in the forest, I imagine. But Lily...\nLILY: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Butterfly saved our lives. But why was there a Warrior egg down here that was ready to hatch in the first place?\nLILY: To make a Worker, the correct nutrients must be added, on the order of the Authority.\nDOCTOR: And if there is no Authority...?\nLILY: Then the eggs remain in their default condition...\nDOCTOR: Ah... now I understand... Oh dear... We are going to have to warn them...\nDOCTOR: 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: Who?\nDOCTOR: Everyone!\nDOCTOR: 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Incoming airborne mass reading! It’s twice the size of your friendly neighbourhood Vrill. Lock and load!\nKLEIN: Wait! Wait, Steffen!\nSTEFFEN: No time for this now, Klein.\nKLEIN: Don’t shoot! What are you doing!?\nSTEFFEN: Base to perimeter, sitrep, over?\nJACKSON: (radio) Target is on south easterly trajectory.\nKLEIN: South-east.\nSTEFFEN: Yes, south-eas— Wait? What?\nKLEIN: It’s not heading away for your base. It’s not attacking you at all. It’s scanning the terrain. It’s looking for something!\nKLEIN: 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Lily, I have to leave the nest and get down the hill to the forest. I have to get to Klein. And the Winterlack, if necessary!\nLILY: It is a long climb down the mountainside... can you not fly...?\nDOCTOR: Well, in a manner of speaking, Lily. Only a fool would walk all the way down the mountain and through the forest. No, I can get down there in my TARDIS.\nLILY: In your what?\nDOCTOR: The blue box. It will take me. I can just nudge it a few miles to the south, and rematerialise...\nLILY: What is the meaning of this strange dance?\nDOCTOR: It’s not a dance, Lily. It’s a.. I can’t seem to find my... Have you, erm... seen the key to my TARDIS anywhere...?\nDOCTOR: 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Jackson, the xenomorph appears to be moving away from the base.\nJACKSON: What? No way!\nJACKSON: It’s turning back again. It’s definitely making sweeps of the\nJACKSON: area, it’s getting closer again.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Do you have a clear sightline?\nJACKSON: I can try. It’s tough to get a lock on.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) I don’t care. Get it out of my sky!\nJACKSON: Roger that.\nJACKSON: It’s coming this way.. nearly there...\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Shoot it down, Jackson.\nSTEFFEN: (FX: .50 CALIBRE GUNS - a slow two or three rounds a second, but still automatic)\nJACKSON: (under his breath) Damn...\nJACKSON: 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: BUTTERFLY (low and up very loud) Find the one called Klein...

What voice?\nKLEIN: Did it talk to him? Was it putting out a signal?\nSTEFFEN: What voice, Jackson?\nJACKSON: (radio) There’s like a message, it’s really loud! Can’t you hear it? It keeps saying “Find the one called Klein!”\nKLEIN: It’s looking for me! Give me a radio!\nSTEFFEN: Hey, those aren’t cheap. You can’t talk to it on a radio!\nKLEIN: It’s so I can talk to you, stupid! It knows my name! It’s looking for me. I’m going outside! The Doctor must have sent\nKLEIN: it!\nSTEFFEN: Who? Klein! Come back! You’1ll get yourself killed...!\nSTEFFEN: (sotto voce) Well... every cloud has a silver lining.\nSTEFFEN: 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Only a fool... me and my big mouth... a fool indeed...\nDOCTOR: Hey! Don’t shoot at it! What are you idiots doing?!\nDOCTOR: Klein! Klein! If you’re down there... oh, what’s the use...\nDOCTOR: 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BIG BAY HATCHES, LARGE ENOUGH FOR A BUS, SWINGING OPEN ON SERVOS)\nKLEIN: Hey! Hey!

It must have been working for the Doctor.\nKLEIN: else would call a Vrill Warrior Butterfly.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) What?\nKLEIN: Butterfly.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Who is this Doctor you keep talking about?\nDOCTOR: (arriving) Oh, that would be me!\nKLEIN: Doctor! I can’t believe it!\nDOCTOR: That I made it down the hill?\nKLEIN: That I’m actually pleased to see you!\nSTEFFEN: (radio —- in background) Klein, are you there? Please respond.\nDOCTOR: Oh, likewise, Klein, I’m sure.\nDOCTOR: Nobody\nDOCTOR: Oh no... my poor little Butterfly! What have they done to you?\nKLEIN: They shot it down, Doctor.\nKLEIN: 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: It saved my life... it saved Lily and me from the Carrion in the Hatching Yard. Poor little thing... I’m sorry, Butterfly... it wasn’t much of a life, was it?\nKLEIN: You were right, by the way. Rose was more susceptible to reason once the wind blew away the signal residue.\nDOCTOR: You talked her out of it?\nKLEIN: Her wings were already failing her, but we landed safely in the forest.\nSTEFFEN: (radio -— in background) Steffen to Klein, are you receiving. Over?\nKLEIN: Wait.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Steffen to Klein, come in -\nSTEFFEN: (FX: CLICK OF RADIO DIAL - WALKIE TALKIE DEMONSTRABLY TURNED OFF)\nKLEIN: (urgently) Doctor, we haven’t got much time! The “Winterlack” are humans—\nDOCTOR: Yes Klein, I found the canister in the nest. But listen—\nKLEIN: They say they are colonists. An advance party, clearing this world for habitation.\nDOCTOR: I don’t care what they are. Klein, we have to get everyone off this planet—\nKLEIN: (whispering) Doctor, they seem to think I am working for some kind of\nKLEIN: protective organisation called the Geopolice.\nDOCTOR: Whatever, but—\nDOCTOR: 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: When were you going to tell me about the Geopolice?\nDOCTOR: It never came up—\nKLEIN: Funny that! Because whoever they are, they are Fascists, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: Well, the Geopolice among the worlds above the galactic plane are very... picky about which civilisations they will deal with.\nDOCTOR: And they are very protective of resources, and if they ring- fence a world, for whatever reason, they expect other races to leave it alone.\nKLEIN: (whispering) They are Fascists! Your big bright future has got Fascists in tes!\nDOCTOR: (sarcastic) Oh Klein. If you want Fascists I’1ll set up a dinner date for you and some Daleks!\nKLEIN: (whispering) quite like pretending to be from the Geopolice. It gets me a lot of respect around here!\nDOCTOR: (sarcastic) I’1ll make you a special hat.\nKLEIN: (whispering) But the moment they find out I’m not in the Geopolice, they will shoot me. And my accomplice.\nDOCTOR: What accompl..? Oh you didn’t?\nKLEIN: They think we are working together. They think we are Geopolice. I’m pretty sure it’s all that stops them from shooting me where I stand.\nDOCTOR: Oh right, so you want me to play along, do you?\nKLEIN: (whispering) This is no joke, Doctor. Their leader is called Steffen. He is sure to be here any moment.\nKLEIN: 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: You want me to pretend to be a-—?\nDOCTOR: (conspicuously loud)\nDOCTOR: Ah, Agent Klein. I wondered when I would find you. How is the Geopolice operation going?\nKLEIN: (playing to the gallery) Everything’s fine, Doctor. Some misunderstandings with the local population, but I think we can sort something out.\nDOCTOR: Good! Ah! You must be Steffen.\nSTEFFEN: (arriving) And you must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I see my reputation precedes me.\nSTEFFEN: I have been explaining to your underling—\nKLEIN: (in background) Underling!?\nSTEFFEN: -that we are mere colonists.\nSTEFFEN: 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: (SOMETHING IS HATCHING.

Or are you alone...?\nDOCTOR: Steffen, your operation here has been... a grey area, I can see that. But I am sure we can come to some arrangement.\nSTEFFEN: Are you asking me to bribe you? Doctor, you are much more fun to deal with than Klein!\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Steffen. You have to get off this planet. You have to leave immediately.\nSTEFFEN: That’s not going to happen.\nDOCTOR: It must happen.\nSTEFFEN: These things take time. I’ve lost most of my men. The geophys’ units and weaponry doesn’t come cheap. We can’t leave until our mission iS a success.\nDOCTOR: It’s not a matter of success, Steffen. It’s a matter of saving lives.\nSTEFFEN: Whose?\nDOCTOR: Yours!\nSTEFFEN: I can look after myself.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me! This is no your mission. It is about before we all die!\nDOCTOR: about bribery.

You’ll get a sufficient bribe, don’t worry.\nDOCTOR: Unless your pitiful little band thinks it can take on an army of Vrill Warriors, you need to get out of here.\nKLEIN: Doctor, I don’t understand. There are no more Vrill. You said yourself. There will be no more new eggs.\nDOCTOR: The egg-laying female in a Vrill nest...\nKLEIN: The Queen?\nDOCTOR: Yes, the Authority, they call her. She can arrange for the development of any Vrill she likes.\nKLEIN: I see you have been busy while I’ve been away.\nDOCTOR: I’ve learned what I can about the Vrill society. Which is not easy when fleeing a berserk monster.\nSTEFFEN: (impatient) What’s your point?\nDOCTOR: The Vrill Authority lays eggs. She can order them to receive particular nutrients. Some are fertilised, others are not.\nKLEIN: Like bees on Earth.\nDOCTOR: Not unlike bees on Earth, yes. If a Vrill Authority thinks that she is dying, she can even authorise the right nutrients in the right egg to create a new Authority. Given time.\nKLEIN: Ah... I see... The operative word being “time”?\nKLEIN: 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Yes. The Vrill society works perfectly. You saw how big the nest is. They didn’t build that in a day.\nKLEIN: And the Authority was completely safe at the centre of the nest...\nDOCTOR: With the Warriors on the outside protecting everyone. See? Absolutely marvellous. Absolutely foolproof!\nSTEFFEN: What’s the problem, then?\nDOCTOR: You’re the problem! You are! You drilled straight into the heart of their nest and rolled in nerve gas!\nSTEFFEN: It worked, didn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Genocide. You killed the Authority before she knew what hit her. It takes days to make a new queen. You killed every adult Vrill in the nest. You murdered them all in one awful half- hour, and now the only eggs that will hatch are the ones that had already been laid.\nKLEIN: If the Authority is dead, surely there will only be a few more eggs hatching. A few more Workers.. posthumous children, and then nothing.\nDOCTOR: Nope. That’s what you’d expect if they were bees. They’re not, they’re Vrill. Big difference.\nSTEFFEN: Well, make up your mind.\nDOCTOR: Vrill Workers are female. They hatch from fertilised eggs. There are four thousand eggs left in the Hatching Yard, and they are all unfertilised.\nKLEIN: Which means they won’t hatch at all.\nDOCTOR: No. It means they hatch as Warriors.\nDOCTOR: 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Wait... they do what!?\nDOCTOR: The Authority is female. The Workers are female. Drones, which I’ve never seen, are male. The Warriors are neuter.\nKLEIN: And they’re the default setting when the Authority is dead...?\nSTEFFEN: This could be tricky...\nDOCTOR: Vrill Warriors, Steffen. Thousands and thousands of them.

Kill the Winterlack.\nWARRIOR VRILL: (FX: ROARS LIKE THOSE OF THE CARRION, BUT NOT ONE OF THEM, TWO, THREE, LOTS...)\nWARRIOR VRILL: (FX: THE VOICES RISE IN A CACOPHONOUS CLAMOUR, IN THE HUNDREDS, AS THEIR WINGS WHIRR AND THEIR HEAVY FOOTFALLS STAMP TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE)\nWARRIOR VRILL: END OF EPISODE THREE\nWARRIOR VRILL: 118\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: EPISODE FOUR\nSTEFFEN: Doctor, I’ve put leave without it.\nSTEFFEN: everything I had into this operation. I can’t\nKLEIN: You have killed an entire race, isn’t that enough?\nSTEFFEN: I have Jackson to think of, and the dependents of the dead.\nDOCTOR: Very well, Steffen. I understand your position.\nDOCTOR: STEFFEN/KLEIN (together) You do!?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I understood it the moment you said you couldn’t leave without 2b”.\nKLEIN: Without what?\nDOCTOR: A good question, Klein. Without what?\nSTEFFEN: We’re.. colonists! We’re the advance party of colonists...\nDOCTOR: Of course you are, Steffen, and that’s what we’ll say on the paperwork. But you’re not really, are you?\nKLEIN: Doctor!\nSTEFFEN: I don’t know what you mean.\nDOCTOR: Klein here is new to the universe at large... she is unlikely to have thought through the implications of some of your claims.\nKLEIN: You are infuriating when you are like this.\nKLEIN: 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Two men and a ship full of military hardware aren’t colonists. And even if they were, no colonial organisation would pick a world infested with giant alien insects.\nSTEFFEN: Where are you going with this, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Where are you going, Steffen? A drill ‘straight ante. the Hatching Yard! Nerve gassing an alien race! And all for what? Is it the eggs? Is it the building materials of the nest?\nKLEIN: Doctor, are you suggesting that these people are just... miners..? Egg thieves...?\nSTEFFEN: We are more like farmers.\nKLEIN: Not if you have to commit genocide to bring in your crops.\nDOCTOR: (sneaky)\nDOCTOR: Call it what you like. Butchers kill livestock, don’t they? Beekeepers “steal” honey. You’re harvesting something aren’t you, Steffen?\nKLEIN: And killing another species!\nSTEFFEN: Farming another species.\nKLEIN: Well, I don’t like how this smells.\nDOCTOR: Smells. Aha! Yes! Klein, you’ve got it!\nKLEIN: (simultaneous) I have?\nSTEFFEN: (simultaneous) She has?\nDOCTOR: You don’t want the Vrill at all, you just want their nutrients.\nDOCTOR: 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Very good, Doctor.\nKLEIN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Vrill nourish their eggs with super concentrated nutrients. They grow to a huge size in a matter of days... it’s a super- food.\nSTEFFEN: It can be diluted to feed humans.\nDOCTOR: Steffen, please pay me the courtesy of not lying any more.\nKLEIN: But he’s right, Doctor. Vrill nutrients could be food for millions.\nDOCTOR: And if undiluted..? A wonder drug? A hyper-growth hormone. Priceless, I’m sure. You’re not colonists at all. You’re.. a smash-and-grab operation. Some military surplus hardware and a few desperate men, and Bob’s your uncle.\nSTEFFEN: You’re no fool, are you Doctor?\nDOCTOR: So, what do you say? Are you ready to deal?\nSTEFFEN: Doctor, we’ll pay the Geopolice fines, if that’s what it takes. You know we’11 still make a handsome profit. But we need the nutrients. Just a few flasks of it will pay all our bills, and your fines, and make our fortunes.\nKLEIN: (aghast) Is it that simple? An act of genocide, written off with a penalty fee?\nDOCTOR: Very well. This is what I propose.\nKLEIN: Doctor, what are you doing?\nKLEIN: 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Prepare your ship for lift-off.\nSTEFFEN: I am not leaving without the nutrient gel!\nDOCTOR: I understand. You and I will go back into the nest to get some from the Hatching Yard.\nKLEIN: Doctor! You said yourself, the place will be crawling with Warrior Vrill!\nDOCTOR: Well... not really. They’re not going to be deaf, blind, confused creatures like the Carrion. They won’t wander aimlessly.\nKLEIN: (realising) They’ re going to find their way out.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. As soon as they get their bearings and sniff the dead Authority’s distress signal, they are going to come streaming out of the nest, ready to kill the Winterlack.\nSTEFFEN: What’s a Winterlack?\nKLEIN: That would be you.\nDOCTOR: So the Hatching Yard might be the safest place on this planet, if we can get behind the enemy lines, so to speak.\nSTEFFEN: You would risk your life for me?\nDOCTOR: I think my life is already at risk, Steffen. I’m just trying to minimise the danger.\nSTEFFEN: And you’ll drop all pending charges from the Geopolice...?\nDOCTOR: I will see what I can do.\nDOCTOR: 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Shut up, Klein.\nSTEFFEN: Yes, Klein, shut up.\nDOCTOR: There’s no time to lose, Steffen! Go back to your ship and make ready!\nDOCTOR: 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: (singing listlessly)\nJACKSON: .And if one green bottle,\nJACKSON: Should accidentally fall,\nJACKSON: There’ll be... Four hundred and twenty-seven green bottles, Sitting on the—\nSTEFFEN: (RADIO) Jackson! We’re leaving!\nJACKSON: But the harvest?\nSTEFFEN: (RADIO)\nSTEFFEN: The Doctor knows his way around a Vrill nest. He’s got a plan.\nJACKSON: He will help you take the nutrients...?\nSTEFFEN: (RADIO) What can I say, we found one who’ll take a back-hander. He’s found a compromise that’s going to get us out of here safely\nJACKSON: Roger that!\nSTEFFEN: (RADIO) Heat up the engines. We’re going to need a quick lift-off.\nJACKSON: Why so quick...?\nSTEFFEN: (RADIO) Because any moment now we’re going to be facing an army of Vrill!\nSTEFFEN: 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: What was that about?\nDOCTOR: What was what about?\nKLEIN: You’re handing him what he wants on a plate! I told you to bluff a little, not collaborate!\nDOCTOR: I don’t need a lecture on moral high ground from you, of all people.\nKLEIN: You’re taking a bribe! You’re helping him steal from the Vrill.\nDOCTOR: If it’ll get him off-world, why not?\nKLEIN: What about the Vrill?\nDOCTOR: They will be turning up very soon to kill everyone.\nKLEIN: I thought you made that bit up.\nDOCTOR: No, they really are!\nKLEIN: And so you want to go back into the middle of said it’s crawling with Vrill! And they are no\nKLEIN: he nest!? You happy!\nDOCTOR: It’s crawling with Warrior Vrill. They’re too big to fit down the drill tunnel. We’1ll only be in danger at—\nKLEIN: At either end!\nDOCTOR: Come with me or stay here, Klein. It’s up to you.\nKLEIN: (dawning) You’re up to something!\nKLEIN: 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: (indignant) The very thought of it..!\nKLEIN: What aren’t you telling me?\nDOCTOR: I need to get back into the Hatching Yards.\nKLEIN: (suspicious) Why...?\nDOCTOR: (lying very badly) To help... the Vrill.\nKLEIN: There’s more to it than that. You’re hiding something.\nDOCTOR: I can’t abandon the Vrill.\nKLEIN: They’ re doomed. No more eggs.\nDOCTOR: Well, the Workers think they’re doomed, and the Warriors are just going to try to kill us all. But I.. just need to have another look around the Hatching Yards.\nKLEIN: And then what..? You’ll be behind enemy lines. The Warrior Vrill will be heading this way. They’1ll be attacking the ship...\nDOCTOR: I imagine that they will be, yes.\nKLEIN: The TARDIS? You’re going to get back in the TARDIS and run away! Aren’t you? Aren’t you!\nDOCTOR: If the situation really is impossible to resolve, then yes, Klein, we will have no choice but to walk away.\nKLEIN: So.. perhaps you could be a little clearer when telling me it is in my interests to go with you.\nKLEIN: 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: All right. I’m not saying I approve, Klein. But... what choice do we have?\nKLEIN: (close and conspiratorial)\nKLEIN: We could go back to the TARDIS right now... abandon Steffen. Abandon him to a death by poetic justice. Torn apart by a hundred Vrill.\nDOCTOR: I’m not ready to give up yet. Not even on Steffen.\nKLEIN: What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: (changing the subject)\nDOCTOR: I hav veryone’s best interests at heart, Klein. Bear with me.\nKLEIN: Everyone’s? Every human’ s!\nDOCTOR: Theirs, and yours, and mine. I have a very delicate, but very well-meaning plan.\nKLEIN: And the Vrill? What about the Vrill. “The common good comes before the private good”!\nDOCTOR: The Vrill, too! Trust me, Klein. I’m a Doctor!\nDOCTOR: 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: I am a pre-flight check-up\nJACKSON: I am a pre-flight check\nJACKSON: I’m Engines... go, and Airlocks.. closed\nJACKSON: And all lights green on Tech...\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Jackson, do you read?\nJACKSON: (off-hand) Loud and clear.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) We’re at the drill tunnel.\nJACKSON: Roger that.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) You’ve got to head straight up. Out of the atmosphere! Otherwise the flying Vrill will get you!\nJACKSON: Aye-aye.\nSTEFFEN: (radio)\nSTEFFEN: Once we’ve got what we need, I’1l radio you when we’re ready for collection. Then you’re going to have to drop down as fast as you can, and be ready to head back out again.\nJACKSON: Got it.\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Seriously. You are going to need to drop out of orbit like a stone and pull five gees heading back up again. Got that.\nJACKSON: Got it! Base out!\nJACKSON: (dismissive)\nJACKSON: Honestly... do I look stupid?\nJACKSON: 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Here it is, Doctor. Rose dragged me the whole length of the tunnel before dumping me in the forest.\nDOCTOR: We’ve got to get in there before the first wave of Warriors comes out of the main entrance.\nSTEFFEN: All. right, all right, lets do iat.\nSTEFFEN: (FX: AWFUL MULTIPLE BUZZING OF HUNDREDS OF VRILL FADING UP AND UP)\nDOCTOR: Ooh, here they come!\nSTEFFEN: Steffen to Jackson, this is not a test! Take off! Take off now! They’re coming!\nDOCTOR: Inside! In the tunnel!\nJACKSON: (radio)\nJACKSON: Steffen! The mass reading’s off the scale! There’s hundreds of them! Thousands!\nJACKSON: 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Get out of there, Jackson!\nJACKSON: Ok. Here we go...\nSTEFFEN: (radio)\nSTEFFEN: Put the guns on automatic. Give yourself a covering blanket of fire. Might slow them down.\nJACKSON: Will do!\nJACKSON: (FX: JACKSON ACTIVATES CONTROLS. WE HEAR THE EXTERIROR MOUTNED\nGUNS: FIRING OFF REGULAR SALVOS.)\nJACKSON: Launching now! Here we go!\nJACKSON: 130\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: That’s it! He’s taking off.\nDOCTOR: Good, good! As long as he gets ahead of the Warriors, we’re laughing.\nKLEIN: Okay... I’m just hoping we don’t run into a Worker coming up the passage.\nDOCTOR: Just in case we do, perhaps it’s best if I go first.\nKLEIN: You couldn’t work that out before we got in the tunnel?\nDOCTOR: Just let me past. Budge over.\nKLEIN: This had better work.\nDOCTOR: Hah! Through! How’s that for lebensraum?\nSTEFFEN: Are you two entirely sure that you know what you’re doing?\nKLEIN: (simultaneous) No.\nDOCTOR: (simultaneous) Yes.\nSTEFFEN: That’s what I was afraid of.\nSTEFFEN: 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Steffen to Jackson, we’re proceeding into the nest. How are you doing? Are you in orbit yet?\nJACKSON: (yelling) Not yet. The bugs are in pursuit. I’m letting them chase me for a few miles...\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Why?\nSTEFFEN: 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: (yelling over radio) Because once they lose sight of the ship, they’re probably going to turn around and head back to you.\nSTEFFEN: Good thinking. Lead them as far away as possible first. Smart!\nDOCTOR: Here we are... the Hatching Yard.\nKLEIN: I don’t see any Vrill!\nSTEFFEN: All the Warriors are off chasing my ship! Doctor, you’re a genius.\nDOCTOR: Well, I try.\nSTEFFEN: Wait! Everybody down!\nDOCTOR: No! Put down the gun! Point it at the—\nDOCTOR: (FX: RIFLE FIRES INTO THE GROUND) !\nSTEFFEN: Are you crazy. Let go of the rifle. There’s a Vrill!\nDOCTOR: Indeed there is!\nLILY: Welcome, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Lily! It’s good to see you again.\nLILY: Doctor, I am pleased that you are not dead.\nDOCTOR: Aren’t we all, Lily.\nDOCTOR: 133\nLILY: The Warriors have hatched.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that is a lot.\nDOCTOR: Lily...\nDOCTOR: know already.\nLILY: Is she a-—\nDOCTOR: She is not that thing that we probably shouldn’t say out\nDOCTOR: I would like to introduce Steffen,\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: By eight times eight times eight—\nDOCTOR WHO: and Klein, whom you\nDOCTOR WHO: loud.\nDOCTOR WHO: No, she is a friend.\nLILY: Welcome, Klein. Welcome, Steffen.\nSTEFFEN: This is unreal... I can’t believe this is happening.\nSTEFFEN: It’s\nSTEFFEN: talking! It’s really talking.\nDOCTOR: Yes, she is.\nSTEFFEN: Quickly Doctor,\nDOCTOR: Steffen. B\nLILY: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Would you be kind enough to show Klein the place where\nDOCTOR: defeated the Carrion?\nKLEIN: What? Why on Earth would I\nDOCTOR: very careful what you say!\nDOCTOR: we need to find the—\nDOCTOR: Lily?\nDOCTOR: we\nDOCTOR: want to-\nDOCTOR: She’d love to see it, woul\nLILY: Of course, Doctor.\nKLEIN: But, Doctor!\nKLEIN: ldn’t you Klein?\nKLEIN: 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Klein, you go with Lily and look at the far side of the Hatching Yard. Far away from Steffen and myself...\nKLEIN: (finally getting it) Er... oh, right, with Lily you mean?\nDOCTOR: (stern) Yes. With Lily.\nLILY: Come Klein, let me show you!\nKLEIN: (sarcastic) That would be great, Lily.\nSTEFFEN: (whispering) Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (whispers) Lily is our friend for as long as we act like hers...\nSTEFFEN: (whispers) Oh... right...\nDOCTOR: (whispers) So I think it’s best, considering you-know-why we’re here, that she’s far away from you-know-what until you-know-when.\nSTEFFEN: Why are you being so coy, can’t you just say—?\nDOCTOR: Ssh! The Vrill believe everything they hear. And I don’t want them hearing something that... upsets them.\nDOCTOR: 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: So this is where the Carrion died?\nLILY: I can still hear its last signals in the air. I am afraid.\nKLEIN: No, Lily, it’s definitely dead. So.. show me where you and the Doctor helped the Warrior Vrill to hatch.\nLILY: It was not I. It was the Doctor. We should not help the Warrior Vrill hatch. They must hatch themselves.\nKLEIN: All right, all right, Lily. Show me where the Doctor did it.\nLILY: We hid among the eggs, but the Carrion saw us.\nKLEIN: Where did you retreat?\nLILY: (a little distance away) Here. This is where it hatched. The Warrior that the Doctor called Butterfly.\nKLEIN: The egg shards are very tough... not really brittle...\nKLEIN: I can’t break one in half. How exactly did you help the Warrior Vrill hatch?\nLILY: The Doctor had a piece of unknown substance. A thing that was like a shard of sharpened material. I thought it was of Winterlack manufacture, but he said it was a.. “just the key to my TARDIS.” Then he lost the “just the key to my TARDIS”.\nKLEIN: He lost the key?\nLILY: Yes.\nKLEIN: Of course...\nKLEIN: 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: Of course what?\nKLEIN: That’s what the Doctor wouldn’t tell me! He wanted to come back to look for the key. Oh Lily! Listen very carefully. I want you to trace your own scent markers. I want you to show me exactly where you and the Doctor were when you were running from the Carrion.\nLILY: We were here...\nKLEIN: No, Lily. I mean exactly. Step by step...\nKLEIN: 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: This is the place! This is the centre of the nest.\nSTEFFEN: Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: That dead body there? That’s the Authority.\nSTEFFEN: (entirely unmoved) Oh, okay. In which case the gel pods should be somewher nearby.\nDOCTOR: Don’t touch them!\nSTEFFEN: What are you afraid of, Doctor. It’s just a sort of alien... honey, I suppose.\nSTEFFEN: Here, why don’t you try some. The Vrill don’t need it.\nDOCTOR: I’d rather not, thank you. So these pods here, they contain the gel that turns neuter eggs into new Workers?\nSTEFFEN: Yeah, but we don’t want those. We want something much rarer... Aha.. this is what I came for.\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nSTEFFEN: These, Doctor, are the most valuable things you can imagine.\nDOCTOR: I have a very vivid imagination.\nSTEFFEN: They are very special Vrill nutrients.\nDOCTOR: But they’re not the usual colour.\nDOCTOR: 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: No, they’re not. This is very rare.\nDOCTOR: How rare...?\nSTEFFEN: Just a few handfuls are probably all there is in the nest.\nDOCTOR: What’s it for.\nSTEFFEN: “For?” It’s for me!\nDOCTOR: What does it do?\nSTEFFEN: “Do?” Doctor, just a drop of this is a wonder-drug.\nDOCTOR: I know that. I meant, what does it do for the Vrill...?\nSTEFFEN: Oh, they don’t need it any more. You said yourself, they’re already dead. They just don’t know it yet.\nDOCTOR: But what would it do?\nSTEFFEN: It would make a new supreme Vrill, like this dead one here.\nDOCTOR: It would create a new Authority?\nSTEFFEN: A new Consort, too.\nDOCTOR: An Adam and Eve for the Vrill. Well why not let them?\nSTEFFEN: What’s the point?\nDOCTOR: I don’t care how many full flasks you take out. But leave one Authority gel and one Consort gel here with me.\nDOCTOR: 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: Or what?\nDOCTOR: (steely) Try me.\nSTEFFEN: You’re a puny little man. And I’m the man with the gun.\nDOCTOR: Just how fast can you shoot before I can shout out to Lily what you really are. And then you’re a dead man just the same.\nDOCTOR: Shall I give it a whirl?\nSTEFFEN: (mollifying) Bul Doctor, hese iare.. Enese are worth so much money!\nDOCTOR: To the Vrill they are worth everything. So take as much as you can carry, but leave one of each gel behind here for me.\nSTEFFEN: This is stupid! We are part of the natural order of things! Survival of the fittest! It applies everywhere in nature, apart from to the human race. We’re supposed to just tiptoe around other cultures out of some insane sense of fair play!\nDOCTOR: Makes perfect sense to me. You’ve got more than enough to pay your debts. So back away now... and head for the exit.\nSTEFFEN: You drive a hard bargain, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Tough.\nDOCTOR: 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: And this is where the Doctor opened Butterfly’s egg.\nKLEIN: Come on... come on... about time my luck changed... aha!\nKLEIN: Oh Lily, you are a good Vrill.\nLILY: Am I?\nKLEIN: I’ve found the key.\nLILY: The Doctor will be pleased.\nKLEIN: (sneaky) Yes... erm. I’11l tell him myself if that’s all right with you. When the time is... right.\nLILY: I should not tell the Doctor that you have found it?\nKLEIN: No, Lily. I will tell him.\nSTEFFEN: (arriving) Time to leave.\nKLEIN: You’ve got everything you need?\nSTEFFEN: (bitterly) So the Doctor says.\nDOCTOR: (distant/calling) Lily, can you buzz over here a moment!\nLILY: The Doctor calls me?\nKLEIN: Yes, Lily, go to him.\nKLEIN: 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: As he commands.\nSTEFFEN: So, back to the drill tunnel?\nKLEIN: No, we should head out through the main tunnels, Atrium.\nSTEFFEN: But the drill tunnel is the quickest route.\nKLEIN: And it’s jam-packed with our recent scent marks.\nSTEFFEN: You mean, the Warriors..?\nKLEIN: The Warriors will smell our signals on the exit. waiting for us when we leav\nSTEFFEN: You know them that well?\nKLEIN: through the\nKLEIN: They’1l be\nKLEIN: It’s what I’d do. Come on, we’ve got a better chance going out\nKLEIN: through the Atrium. (calling/echoes across Ha Hurry up, Doctor! We don’t\nKLEIN: ching Yard) have much time!\nKLEIN: 142\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: You wanted to see me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Lily, how are new Vrill made?\nLILY: Authority Gel on the right egg. Consort Gel on the right egg, and a mating pair is created.\nDOCTOR: How much of this “gel” do you need?\nLILY: Only a small amount. A handful.\nDOCTOR: This much?\nLILY: That will be sufficient.\nDOCTOR: Are there any unhatched eggs left? Any at all?\nLILY: Just a few. Less than eight.\nDOCTOR: We only need two!\nLILY: There are two.\nDOCTOR: That’s all we need! We’ve got the gel, we’ve got the eggs. We can make an Adam and Eve for a new generation of Vrill. We can save the nest!\nLILY: We cannot.\nDOCTOR: What!? Don’t tell me there’s small print..?\nDOCTOR: 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nLILY: The Authority must order the use of the gel. Only an Authority can order the making of a new Authority. Only an Authority can provide the gel.\nDOCTOR: (sneaky) Okay... Lily... Lily, I want you to think about this, all right?\nLILY: Think about what?\nDOCTOR: (manipulative) Who is the only one who can provide the gel?\nLILY: The Authority.\nDOCTOR: Who’s got the gel right now?\nLILY: You have, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Right. So what does that make me?\nLILY: Doctor? Are you an Authority?\nDOCTOR: I most certainly am! Right, Lily, you’ve got your mission. Take these flasks. One for Adam. One for Eve. Put them on the two best-looking unhatched eggs you can find. Get them in the bubbling waters in the right place. Alright? Because you know what that means!\nLILY: It will create a new Authority!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Lily, that’s exactly what it will do!\nLILY: Do you wish it so?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I wish it so! Now go! Go! Do it!\nDOCTOR: 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: (chuckles) A new beginning.\nDOCTOR: 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Now what’s keeping the old fool?\nSTEFFEN: Beats me. How far to the Atrium?\nKLEIN: We’re nearly there. If I remember right, ah, here we are!\nSTEFFEN: I’ve never been so pleased to see daylight!\nKLEIN: Me neither. Well, Steffen, this is where we part company.\nSTEFFEN: You’re not coming with me on the ship?\nKLEIN: Er.. no, I have my own transport. Call Jackson down and get out of here before the Warrior Vrill come back!\nSTEFFEN: But what about the Doctor?\nKLEIN: He’d better hurry! No time! Come on! Call it in! Get your ship down here!\nKLEIN: 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Steffen to Jackson, don’t wimp out on me now.\nJACKSON: Jackson, receiving, over.\nSTEFFEN: (radio)\nSTEFFEN: We’re at the main entrance to the nest. Get down here.\nJACKSON: (warning) We’re coming in hot!\nSTEFFEN: (radio) The hotter the better. Whatever holds off any Vrill!\nJACKSON: Roger that. ETA... one minute!\nJACKSON: Fast!\nJACKSON: 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: (arriving) Hello, you two! Did I miss anything?\nSTEFFEN: They’re on their way!\nKLEIN: Better make it fast!\nDOCTOR: Not... quite.. fast enough, I fear. I hear a buzzing...\nKLEIN: It’s the Warriors! They’re already back! To the TARDIS, quick!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid the TARDIS isn’t much help to us now.\nVRILL: WARRIORS (rondeau, with more voices adding) Unknown creatures in the Atrium. Identify yourselves! Identify or die!\nSTEFFEN: I can shoot the first couple... but after that, we’re dead.\nDOCTOR: No, Steffen! Don’t shoot anything!\nKLEIN: Doctor! They’1ll listen to you! Hold them back!\nDOCTOR: All right, all right. All Vrill, listen to me! I am the Doctor. I am the Authority! Do not attack anyone. Stay where you are. Do not interfere!\nDOCTOR: 148\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: Jackson to Steffen, we are nearly there. Get ready to run for the ship. You can’t miss us, the hull’s going to be glowing red hot!\nSTEFFEN: (radio) Stand by!\nSTEFFEN: 149\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nSTEFFEN: My cue to leave, I think.\nKLEIN: You got that right.\nDOCTOR: (stage whisper) Klein! Klein! The exit is that way!\nKLEIN: I’m not going that way, Doctor. I have somewhere else to be!\nDOCTOR: (stage whispers) Klein, where on Earth... no! No, you can’t!\nKLEIN: Oh but I can, the TARDIS is right here in the Atrium.\nDOCTOR: (stage whispers) Klein, we can’t leave this planet! Not yet!\nKLEIN: Let me through, there’s a good Vrill, let me through... thank you.\nWARRIOR: VRILL You are not an intruder... You are a friend...\nDOCTOR: (stage whispers) Klein! You are playing with fire.\nKLEIN: I am the Doctor, you know! I am the Authority. So you should just back away and let me through.\nDOCTOR: (stage whispers) Klein!\nKLEIN: If I’ve got the right idea, it would seem that the truth is whatever the Vrill hear... and they are happy for as long they hear only things they like the sound of. So I am the Doctor. I am the Authority, let me through...\nDOCTOR: Klein! We can’t leave yet!\nDOCTOR: 150\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: Because you haven’t found your precious key?\nDOCTOR: How do you know about my—\nDOCTOR: The key to the TARDIS! Hand it over, Klein.\nKLEIN: Shoe’s on the other foot now, Doctor. Now, I’m in the driving seat.\nDOCTOR: Haven’t you learnt anyting on our travels together, Klein?\nKLEIN: Attention all Vrill. Do not let Blue Box. If he tries, you must\nKLEIN: that creature approach the kill him.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing?\nKLEIN: Don’t contradict me. You know how the Vrill don’t like it!\nDOCTOR: No, you don’t understand!\nKLEIN: Oh yes I do. You manipulated me. Tricked me into obliterating my own history. My own future. Did you really believe that I could just forget about that?\nDOCTOR: I thought you were making progress.\nKLEIN: Because that’s what you wanted to believe. That I could somehow be ‘rehabilitated’ to see the Universe through your blinkered eyes. You condescending hypocrite! Well now it’s my turn. Every journey we’ve made, I’ve been watching and learning as you operated the TARDIS. Now it’s mine again. All time and space will lay before me. A thousand-year Reich!\nDOCTOR: Once a Nazi, always a Nazi! Klein! You’1ll ruin everything!\nDOCTOR: 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nKLEIN: The Reich will rise again. It will be my victory.\nDOCTOR: Not on Barth! Here! You’ll ruin everything here!\nKLEIN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: The moment the TARDIS leaves this continuum, the Gift will be revoked.\nKLEIN: The what?\nDOCTOR: The translation! There will be no more translation. Vrill and humans will be unable to communicate. Steffen or some fool like him will just repeat the cycle. All hope of a treaty will be lost. It will just be Vrill and humans, in a struggle to the death\nKLEIN: In which case Doctor...\nKLEIN: .you’d better start running!\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR: 152\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: Jackson to Steffen, ETA thirty seconds. Get ready to run!\nJACKSON: 153\nJACKSON: 87.\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ATRIUM.\nSTEFFEN: The Blue box!\nSTEFFEN: It just disappeared!\nDOCTOR: Time to run, Steffen!\nSTEFFEN: You had transmat technology and you never told me! Hey... it’s awfully quiet all of a sudden.\nDOCTOR: Really, Steffen. Start walking down the hillside... quick as you like...\nSTEFFEN: Why are the Vrill approaching again? I thought you ordered them to stop.\nDOCTOR: They can’t hear me anymore,\nSTEFFEN: Steffen.\nSTEFFEN: And we can’t hear them!\nDOCTOR: That’s right... keep walking... keep walking...\nSTEFFEN: What’s happened?\nDOCTOR: We’ve lost the Gift of the TARDIS.\nSTEFFEN: The what?\nDOCTOR: There’s Viera,\nSTEFFEN: So what’s the problem... Doctor,\nSTEFFEN: no more communication between us, Steffen. Us and the\nSTEFFEN: we’re deaf to each other.\nSTEFFEN: why the sudden retreat?\nSTEFFEN: 154\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nDOCTOR: Because the very last thing that the Vrill heard was someone claiming to be the Doctor leaving them.\nSTEFFEN: But it was Klein.\nDOCTOR: The Vrill aren’t too hot quite gullible like that.\nDOCTOR: on truth and lies, Steffen. They’re\nDOCTOR: ct ct\nSTEFFEN: Okay, Doctor. Whatever.\nDOCTOR: If you value your life, keep walking down the hillside.\nSTEFFEN: I’m not playing your game. I’m going to play Klein’s.\nDOCTOR: Not advisable. Your ship is approaching. We are nearly out of trouble. Steffen, come back, it’s too dangerous. They won’t hear you!\nSTEFFEN: Hello Vrill! Remember me? I am the Doctor. I am the Doctor. I just need to go back to the Hatching Yard...\nDOCTOR: Steffen! The ship is here! Forget the Hatching Yard!\nSTEFFEN: Let me through, there’s a good Vrill. Hey, no shoving... Hey!\nSTEFFEN: 155\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: Doctor! Where are the others? Steffen!\nDOCTOR: Too late! He’s gone! They’re both gone!\nJACKSON: The Vrill are coming, they’re heading this way!\nDOCTOR: Get us up! Straight Up! Into orbit! Out of the atmosphere!\nJACKSON: Roger that!\nJACKSON: 156\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: Orbit achieved.\nDOCTOR: We are out of the atmosphere?\nJACKSON: Yeah! Like I said, we’re in orbit.\nDOCTOR: Thanks, Jackson, you saved my life.\nJACKSON: Just returning the favour, Doctor. If you hadn’t warned us about the Vrill, they would have torn us apart on the ground.\nDOCTOR: Well, I guess we’r ven.\nJACKSON: And I guess we should give it a couple of weeks in orbit.\nDOCTOR: What? Why?\nJACKSON: Well, there’s nothing but Warriors down there. Without any Workers to find them food, they’1ll starve to death by then. We can go back down and clean up. Grab what we want.\nDOCTOR: I’m not all that sorry to disappoint you, Jackson, but that’s not going to happen.\nDOCTOR: But Steffen said—!\nDOCTOR: I don’t care what Steffen said. The Vrill have a new Authority. They’ve made it through by the skin of their teeth. But by the time this generation of Warriors dies off, the nest will b ntirely repopulated.\nJACKSON: What!? How did that happen...!?\nDOCTOR: (evasive) Well... the Vrill are sneakier than you might think.\nDOCTOR: 157\nDOCTOR WHO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\nJACKSON: Guess so... Sorry about Klein.\nDOCTOR: What?\nJACKSON: Sorry about Klein. Dying down there.\nDOCTOR: (bitterly) Oh she’s not dead... She got clean away.\nJACKSON: Oh, good.\nDOCTOR: Not really. It might have been better for us all if the Vrill had got her, too...\nJACKSON: I thought she was your friend.\nDOCTOR: (ironic) No... We were never really friends.\nJACKSON: But if she got away, where did she go?\nDOCTOR: (sighs)\nDOCTOR: Where indeed? She could be anywhere... literally anywhere... and there’s nothing I can do to stop her... The universe had better watch out.\nCLOSING: THEME MUSIC\nCLOSING: END OF EPISODE FOUR\nCLOSING: 158"
