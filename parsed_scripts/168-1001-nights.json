(FX: MORE TAPPING ON STONE) He wouldn’t listen to a word I said: just blocked his ears and had me thrown me in here.\nOLD MAN: Perhaps, Doctor, you should explain to him how you came to be here, and he might look more kindly on your intrusion?\nDOCTOR: (FX: STILL TAPPING) Anyone who condemns a sick man like you to this sort of squalor can’t be reasoned with. (STOPS TAPPING) I only hope Nyssa isn’t foolish enough to try.\nOLD MAN: Squalor? There isn’t a chamber to equal this in the whole Arabian Peninsula.

Forgive me if I seemed a little confused when you arrived. My guards — they should have announced you.\nDOCTOR: (REALIZING HE’S MAD) Ah.

(FX: DRAWING HIS SWORD) Her blood shall water the roses in the palace garden.\nSULTAN: No. Wait. Guards — out. You handmaidens, too. I would speak more with this creature.\nSULTAN: You too, Nazar. Leave me your sword for protection.\nNAZAR: Surely your excellency cannot believe her lies?\nSULTAN: Don’t tell me what I can and cannot do, Nazar. Now: out!\nNAZAR: (HANDING OVER HIS SWORD & OBEYING) Your majesty.\nNYSSA: Why did you send them away?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 12\nSULTAN: What? Let them stay and have the secrets of the stars overheard by illiterate guards and fawning girls? No. Now, relieve me of my ignorance or I shall use Nazar’s sword to relieve you of your pretty head. You have been to other worlds, you say?\nNYSSA: Yes.\nSULTAN: And these demons you claim are coming here — they are from other worlds too?\nNYSSA: There’s a beacon — a device which transmits a signal, like a mirror flashing from a mountain top — hidden somewhere in this building. It belongs to a species called the Gantha. They were paid to come to this world and find something of great value. Whatever it was, they found it here, in your palace — and they activated their beacon the moment they discovered it.\nSULTAN: Then these ‘Gantha’ are the demons of which you speak?\nNYSSA: No. They’re just muscle for hire: intergalactic thugs. They found whatever it was and cleared out. Their beacon is summoning whoever hired them, so they might retrieve it. Those are the ‘demons’.\nSULTAN: I see. So which of my treasures are they coming for?\nNYSSA: (FRUSTRATED) That’s what the Doctor was trying to find out! We don’t know what it is, or who is coming.\nSULTAN: I understand now why you made up a story about flying carpets.\nNYSSA: The Gantha only work for the worst kind of monsters. We need to find and deactivate that beacon — then you and your palace will be out of danger. Please, your highness: this isn’t a fairytale.\nSULTAN: (BEAT) Very well. I believe you.\nNYSSA: Then you’1ll release the Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 13\nSULTAN: No. Not yet.\nNYSSA: Why not?\nSULTAN: This ‘beacon’ can wait. Demons may ride on the wings of night, but I doubt even they could cross the stars in a mere matter of hours. We have time. Besides, I want to hear more about these other worlds. About you... and your ‘Doctor’.\nNYSSA: We can tell you afterwards. Both of us!\nSULTAN: I'd prefer to be told now — and by you.\nNYSSA: Why?\nSULTAN: My guards were right: I do want amusement. You have heard of Shaharazad, who spent one thousand and one nights telling stories to her Sultan to save the life of another?\nNYSSA: A thousand and one nights-?!\nSULTAN: I doubt I will keep you as long as that.\nNYSSA: This is preposterous!\nSULTAN: Preposterous or not, it’s the only way to save your precious Doctor. I shall stay his execution just so long as you keep me amused. And who knows? If I like your stories enough, I may even release the fellow.\nNYSSA: And if you don’t?\nSULTAN: Then the Doctor dies and you take his place in the dungeons.\nNYSSA: The Doctor says you can tell a lot about a man by the way he treats his prisoners.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 14\nSULTAN: It seems to me that a man like the Doctor can be no stranger to a prison cell.\nNYSSA: That’s true enough. There was this one world we visited, not long ago — (CUTTING HERSELF SHORT) No, I’m not playing your\nNYSSA: stupid game.\nSULTAN: Come, Nyssa. Just one story, then I’1l release the Doctor and we can find this beacon of yours. I promise.\nNYSSA: How can I trust you?\nSULTAN: You can’t afford not to. Now, tell me about this other world. Why did you go there?\nNYSSA: We didn’t mean to. The TARDIS — our ship — it just took us there by accident. (FX: BEGIN CROSSFADE TO NEXT SCENE:) I'd never seen anywhere so desolate.

Perfumed rain falling from clouds sown with powdered diamonds — you wouldn’t want to miss that.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: I’ve had the invitation for the last three hundred years, Nyssa.\nPRISONER: (FAINT, ECHOING FROM DISTANCE) He wants to kill me-! Please!\nDOCTOR: I can wait a little longer. (FX: HE CLOSES THE TARDIS DOOR)\nDOCTOR: Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. PRISON — CORRIDOR/EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MUFFLED ANGRY ENERGY CRACKLE FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.\nDOCTOR: & NYSSA’S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS RUN UP.)\nPRISONER: (FROM WITHIN; TORTURED) It burns..! Make it stop!\nNYSSA: (LOUDLY) It’s alright, we’re here! (TO THE DOCTOR) Doctor, the door -\nDOCTOR: (FRANTICALLY PRESSING BUTTONS) A logarithmic key combination. This might take a little time —\nDOCTOR: (TRIUMPHANTLY) Aha! (A RUDE ‘ERROR’ BLEEP) Ah.\nNYSSA: Here, let me try. You never were any good with logarithms.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll have you know I was first [in my class] -\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nPRISONER: (IN PAIN) At last. Please... make it [stop!] (FX: ENERGY\nPRISONER: CRACKLE) (GASPS)\nNYSSA: (RUSHING IN) What is this thing?\nDOCTOR: An electric chair. High voltage passes through the conducting plates and electrocutes the occupant.\nNYSSA: Why would anyone make such a thing?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 18\nPRISONER: (GRITTED TEETH) To torture me, of course — (FX: ENERGY CRACKLE) (GASPS)\nDOCTOR: How lucky you were, Nyssa, to grow up in the civilized serenity of the Traken Union. (STEPPING FORWARD) But there’s a whole universe of horrors beyond — (WALKS INTO FORCEFIELD) (FX: SHIMMERING HUM AS HE DOES SO. IN PAIN) Ow!\nNYSSA: A force field?\nDOCTOR: Surrounding the inner chamber.\nPRISONER: (IN PAIN) Please! He’s going to kill me!\nNYSSA: There must be something we can do!\nDOCTOR: (FX: HUM INCREASES AS HE PUSHES AGAINST FIELD, DECREASES AS HE RELAXES. IT HURTS TO DO SO) Interesting. You see the positrons rushing to resist my hand when I push against it?\nNYSSA: Doesn’t that hurt?\nDOCTOR: Yes. You try it.\nNYSSA: It’s all right: I believe you.\nDOCTOR: Just do it. Please.\nNYSSA: (EFFORT. HUM INCREASES. IN PAIN) You’re right: it does hurt.\nDOCTOR: Keep pushing — hard as you can. See? The positrons are swarming to resist you now.\nNYSSA: (EFFORT. IN PAIN) I take it there’s a reason I’m doing this.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: It’s a fixed-atom force field, designed to repel entry at a Single point only. Your pushing there creates a weaker point elsewhere in the field. (BEGINS PUSHING AT ANOTHER SPOT. IN PAIN, PUSHING THROUGH THE FORCEFIELD LIKE PASSING THROUGH JELLY) Weak enough... for me... to squeeze through...\nDOCTOR: Done it!\nNYSSA: (STILL PUSHING. IN PAIN) Can I stop now?\nDOCTOR: Sorry — yes.\nNYSSA: Good. Give me a moment to recover — then I’11 let you both out.\nDOCTOR: You can’t, I’m afraid. The trick only works if both parties are on the same side of the force field.\nDOCTOR: And this fellow would never survive the process.\nNYSSA: So you’re stuck inside the force field?\nDOCTOR: Temporarily. Which is why I need you to find out where it’s being powered from, and shut it down. I’1ll see if I can undo these restraints while you’re gone.\nPRISONER: (PAIN. PANTING. EXHAUSTED) There’s a control room, below ground. Two floors down, red door — (FX: CRACKLE) (CRIES OUT)\nNYSSA: I’ll find it. (EXITING) I’1l be back as soon as I can, Doctor!\nPRISONER: (IN PAIN) Quick, before he comes back!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: (UNDOING RESTRAINTS) Just hold still, I need to time releasing the manacles in between successive [shocks—]\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/PRISONER:\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. PRISON — CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: (ONTO LOWER LEVEL) Level Minus Two. Now... red door, red door... I think I’1ll try down [here]- (SUDDENLY GRABBED) Aah!\nWARDEN: (BEHIND HER, HOLDING ON) Who are you? What are you doing here?\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING) Let me go and I’1l tell you!\nWARDEN: Oh, you’ll tell me alright. (FX: PRODUCES JANGLING SHACKLE) Head still, if you don’t want the collar to choke you —\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING) What are you doing?\nWARDEN: I said, head still!\nWARDEN: (RELEASING NYSSA) There, that’s better.\nNYSSA: (GASPING) Get this — thing off me!\nWARDEN: Careful. It doesn’t do to tamper with a compliance collar.\nNYSSA: A what?\nWARDEN: A compliance collar. It ensures you tell the truth.\nNYSSA: (DISMISSIVE) And how exactly does it do that?\nWARDEN: By passing 10,000 volts through your brain, should it detect a lie. Now: who you are, and what you’re doing here.\nNYSSA: My name’s Nyssa. I just arrived here, with my friend the Doctor —\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 22\nWARDEN: And where is this Doctor?\nNYSSA: Upstairs.\nWARDEN: With the prisoner?\nNYSSA: The man you’re torturing, yes. We’re trying to free him.\nWARDEN: You what?\nNYSSA: He’s in agony — screaming for his life! What you’re doing is inhuman!\nWARDEN: You stupid [idiots]- (CUTS HIMSELF OFF). Have you any idea of what you’ve done? Come on! (GRABS HER)\nNYSSA: Where are we going?\nWARDEN: To the control room. There’s a communicator in there.\nNYSSA: You're wasting your time. You’ll never talk the Doctor into condoning torture.\nWARDEN: (HURRYING, DRAGGING HER) It’s not him I want to talk to. If this Doctor friend of yours is in the cell with that thing, he’s already as good as dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FORCE FIELD ENERGY HUM. CHAINS AND RESTRAINTS FALLING TO FLOOR)\nDOCTOR: There. Not bad for a man with singed fingers. Must remember to thank dear old Harry Houdini for the lock-picking tips. Can you stand?\nPRISONER: (GETTING UP) I... I think so. We have to get out of here before...\nDOCTOR: Before ‘he’ comes back, I know. Don’t worry, Nyssa’1l soon have that force field turned off. I’m the Doctor, by the way.\nNYSSA: (ON INTERCOM) Doctor? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! What’s happening with the force field?\nNYSSA: (ON INTERCOM) Doctor, there’s someone else here —\nPRISONER: It’s him! I told you!\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) Doctor, this is the warden speaking. The prisoner you’re with is a dangerous criminal.\nPRISONER: Don’t listen to him!\nDOCTOR: Dangerous or not, nothing this man has done can justify such barbaric treatment!\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) Ask him, Doctor. Ask that creature what he did. (CHUCKLE) But be quick about it — you don’t have much time.\nPRISONER: Oh no, no!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 24\nNYSSA: (ON INTERCOM) What’s that noise?\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) The execution protocol has been activated. The clock is ticking, creature.\nDOCTOR: Execution?!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. PRISON — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: (OVER THE INTERCOM) Warden this is madness. I demand [to see]\nWARDEN: Best not to hear what’s about to happen.\nNYSSA: What do you mean ‘Execution Protocol’?\nWARDEN: It’s an automated failsafe, designed for security breaches\nWARDEN: such as this. The force field surrounding that creature has begun to contract. In less than six minutes’ time, it’ll be smaller than he is. He’ll be crushed to death.\nNYSSA: But the Doctor’s in there!\nWARDEN: (THOUGHTFUL) You’re right: that does make a difference.\nNYSSA: You’re going to let him go?\nWARDEN: No, I was just pondering the physics: the added mass means death will come sooner. (FX: PRESSING BUTTONS) In four minutes, fifty-six seconds, to be precise.\nNYSSA: But the Doctor hasn’t done anything! You’re murdering an innocent man!\nWARDEN: Innocent? He tried to free a highly dangerous criminal. He interfered with due process.\nNYSSA: You can’t just execute him!\nWARDEN: I’ve no choice! You know as well as I do that we can’t risk that creature getting out!\nNYSSA: Why? Who is he? What’s he done?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 26\nWARDEN: (AMAZED) You really don’t know who the prisoner is, do you?\nNYSSA: No, I really don’t know who the prisoner is — and neither does the Doctor!\nWARDEN: Remarkable! The compliance collar hasn’t shocked you. (LAUGHS) You’re telling the truth!\nNYSSA: I find precious little to laugh at. So tell me: who is this dangerous villain?\nWARDEN: It’s the Miaxa. Yes, girl, your friend’s locked in there with one of the wickedest monsters in creation. Now do you see what you’ve done?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BUZZ/HUM OF FORCEFIELD BECOMES GRADUALLY CLOSER\nTHROUGHOUT: SUBSEQUENT EXECUTION CHAMBER SCENES)\nDOCTOR: (A BUZZ AS THE DOCTOR BURNS HIS HAND ON THE FORCE FIELD.) Ow! That forcefield’s getting closer. (LOUDLY) Hello? Look, if I’m to be crushed to my constituent atoms along with this man, can I at least ask why?\nPRISONER: He won’t answer. He never does.\nDOCTOR: Maybe someone else will. There must be other people here: guards.\nPRISONER: No-one. Only him. And me.\nDOCTOR: That’s all? A prison at the edge of nowhere, with only one prisoner and one jailer? (THE THOUGHT OCCURS TO HIM) How long have you been here?\nPRISONER: I.. I don’t know. He won’t tell me. He just keeps on tormenting me. Torturing me. Telling me to confess.\nDOCTOR: Confess? To what?\nPRISONER: I don’t know! He never tells me. Oh, Doctor, if you only knew the things he’s done to me, time and time again! Over and over, until... (STARTS SOBBING) until I die.\nDOCTOR: Until what?\nPRISONER: Don’t you see? This has happened before. I’ve died in this room, time and time again. And I don’t know why. He never tells me. Don’t you understand? He’s calls me a monster — but it’s he who’s the monster, not me.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. PRISON — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: AS BEFORE. LITTLE BLEEPS AS THE WARDEN CHECKS THE\nCOUNTDOWN: )\nWARDEN: Three minutes nine seconds now.\nNYSSA: Who is he, this Miaxa?\nWARDEN: He created an empire. The Most Serene Blightstar Hegemony. An alliance such as the universe had never before witnessed. Ten thousand worlds united, in peace and prosperity.\nNYSSA: Well, how’s that a crime?\nWARDEN: He destroyed it — just like that. (CLICKS HIS FINGERS) Plunged it into war. Thousands of once-thriving planets are now just lifeless rock, orbiting dead stars. So many worlds, so many dead. The legacy of the Miaxa.\nNYSSA: And it’s your job to make sure he pays?\nWARDEN: I am the Warden. He is the prisoner. He must be made to confess. He must be punished for his crimes.\nNYSSA: On whose authority? Who put you in charge here?\nWARDEN: (DOUBTS CREEPING IN) I.. I am the Warden. I have always been in charge. You’re trying to confuse me. You and your Doctor, you’re working for him, aren’t you? He brought you here. To help him escape.\nNYSSA: You know that’s not true.\nWARDEN: What are you doing?\nNYSSA: (STILL OPERATING) Pausing the countdown.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 29\nWARDEN: You can’t do that! You must comply!\nNYSSA: Must I? (FINAL FLICK OF A SWITCH) There: countdown paused at one minute forty-eight seconds.\nWARDEN: That collar... it must be faulty.\nNYSSA: Look, I am innocent! The Doctor is innocent! So what makes you sure your prisoner’s not innocent, too?\nWARDEN: The things he did. He has to remember them. He has to confess. He has to accept his share of the guilt.\nNYSSA: What do you mean ‘his share of the guilt’?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: The force field: it’s stopped contracting!\nPRISONER: He’s done that before — the Warden. He likes to draw it out.\nDOCTOR: Tell me: how is it you can remember being executed?\nPRISONER: I— I don’t know...\nDOCTOR: Well, let’s start with what you do know: what’s your name?\nPRISONER: I don’t know.\nDOCTOR: Very well. The Warden — what’s his name?\nPRISONER: That I do know. He is called the Miaxa.\nDOCTOR: (WITH REALIZATION) The Miaxa? Oh, I’m so sorry. I’m so very sorry.\nNYSSA: (ON INTERCOM) Doctor, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. PRISON — CONTROL ROOM\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) I hear you, Nyssa! Listen to me: the prisoner with me—\nNYSSA: (INTERRUPTING) Yes, I know. He’s some kind of war criminal called the Miaxa.\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) I’m afraid it’s rather more complicated than that. The Warden — is he still there?\nNYSSA: (PROMPTING HIM) Warden?\nWARDEN: I’m here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) Then listen very carefully...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: . the Miaxa was the ruler of a great empire, but the time of that empire was millennia ago. Thousands of years in the past — do you understand, Warden?\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) Go on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: He ruled wisely and benignly, but there was a war.\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) Started by him!\nDOCTOR: Started by his own madness. The Miaxa belonged to a race of powerful psychics, but something unbalanced his mind. What it was, no one knows, but once started it couldn’t be stopped. It grew. And the Miaxa’s insanity manifested itself in a very particular way.\nNYSSA: (ON INTERCOM) What way?\nDOCTOR: He had a split personality, Nyssa: seriously split. Eventually, one part of that mind — the sane part — won, and managed to bring the war to an end.\nPRISONER: I... I remember.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. PRISON — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) But it was weak and damaged, afraid of its darker side. Scared of its own madness.\nWARDEN: These are fairy tales!\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) So it hid itself away where it thought it would never be found: at the edge of the known universe.\nWARDEN: (QUIETLY) No...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) Because of the Miaxa’s immense psychic powers, its separate personalities began to take on physical manifestations. Thought became flesh. So it built a prison to hold itself, to protect the rest of the universe from its own insanity.\nPRISONER: (REMEMBERING) A prison, yes!\nDOCTOR: But something went wrong. The insane part became dominant again, and re-took control, imprisoning its other self, torturing it, killing it, again and again and again. Enraged that it alone had to bear the guilt for the crimes they had committed together!\nWARDEN: (ON INTERCOM) Lies! Lies! You are his accomplices!\nPRISONER: No. The Doctor and the girl are innocent. He is telling the truth and you know it! You are the Miaxa. I am the Miaxa. We are one and the same!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. PRISON — CONTROL ROOM\nPRISONER: (ON INTERCOM) We are the Miaxa!\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nWARDEN: Restarting the countdown.\nNYSSA: You can’t do that! You’1l kill them!\nWARDEN: I know. Come with me. (GRABS NYSSA)\nNYSSA: (BEING GRABBED) You’re insane!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. PRISON — EXECUTION CHAMBER\nPRISONER: (CONSTRICTED) We are sorry, Doctor. You did not deserve to die for our crimes.\nDOCTOR: (CONSTRICTED) I think things are about to get rather unpleasant in here.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLANG OF DOOR OPENING, BEHIND FIELD. WARDEN & NYSSA\nRUSHING: IN)\nWARDEN: (STRIDING FORWARD) Push against the field, girl!\nNYSSA: What? I thought you wanted them dead?\nDOCTOR: (CONSTRICTED) Nyssa, can we debate the niceties of this later? For now, do as the Warden says and push!\nWARDEN: (PUSHING AGAINST FIELD, AS BEFORE) The field is weakening! Doctor, your hand!\nDOCTOR: What about the prisoner? I won’t leave an innocent man to die!\nWARDEN: He is not innocent!\nNYSSA: (EFFORT) Doctor, I can’t hold the field much longer!\nPRISONER: The Warden’s right, Doctor. Leave me!\nDOCTOR: Take my hand, come on. (BEGINS SQUEEZING THROUGH THE FORCE FIELD) We can both make it.\nWARDEN: (WITH EFFORT) Oh... no... you... don’t!\nDOCTOR: (WITH EFFORT) Aaaahh!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DOCTOR IS FLUNG OUT OF THE FIELD ONTO THE FLOOR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WARDEN SLIPS INSIDE THE FORCE FIELD)\nNYSSA: (BREAKING OFF) Doctor! Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: (WINDED, BUT GETTING TO HIS FEET) I’m fine, Nyssa. Warden: I insist you [release] — (BREAKS OFF AS HE REALIZES WHAT’S\nHAPPENED: )\nNYSSA: (REALISATION) The Warden! He must have slipped inside when you came out! They’re both in there now!\nWARDEN: The Miaxa must die!\nPRISONER: Farewell, Doctor. Farewell!\nPRISONER: (FX: ENORMOUS BUZZ/HUM AS THE FORCE FIELD CRUSHES THEM BOTH. THEN CEASES ABRUPTLY. IN THE QUIET AFTERMATH. )\nNYSSA: (UPSET) That’s horrible. Horrible. Why did he do it?\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) The Warden wasn’t about to allow the Prisoner to escape, even if it meant executing himself.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FORCE FIELD FLICKERS BACK INTO LIFE. IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT:\nSOMETHING: IS BEING CREATED WITHIN IT)\nNYSSA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The matter in there, it’s recombining! Of course! The flesh may decay, but the thought remains.\nNYSSA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: The Prisoner said, he’d died before. Again and again. But each time his psychic abilities enabled him to draw his constituent parts back together!\nNYSSA: But they died together this time.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: So they did. Which means...\nMIAXA: (FX: WEIRD VOICE — A COMBINATION OF PRISONER/WARDEN) We are the Miaxa. We are.. together again.\nDOCTOR: And not before time.\nNYSSA: Wait here, Doctor, I’1l turn off the force field. (MAKES TO GO)\nMIAXA: No! We must not be freed. We must never be freed. We are your prisoners now.\nDOCTOR: I won’t be anyone’s jailer. Not even yours.\nMIAXA: No! You must leave us! Leave us to be punished!\nNYSSA: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: I’ve always held, you can tell a lot about a man by the way he treats his prisoners. Tell you what, Miaxa — this is what I’m going to do...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: EXT. PRISON YARD\nDOCTOR: Hello, old girl. Did you miss us? (OPENS TARDIS DOOR) Come on, Nyssa. Time to go. Perfumed rain falling from clouds sown with powdered diamonds, remember?\nNYSSA: It doesn’t feel right, Doctor: leaving the Miaxa here.\nDOCTOR: He'll be free to go, in time.\nNYSSA: Only if that ‘psychic aggression filter’ you patched into the force field controls does its job properly.\nDOCTOR: And what ‘psychic aggression filter’ would that be, hm?\nNYSSA: The one you told him would deactivate the field, as soon as the hostility levels in his psyche fell below a certain [point] — (PENNY DROPS) There’s no such thing, is there?\nDOCTOR: No. I set the forcefield to deactivate itself automatically in three months’ time. Long enough to convince the Miaxa that he’s been cured.\nNYSSA: You tricked him.\nDOCTOR: If he thinks he’s not a monster — chances are, he won’t behave like one.\nNYSSA: You hope.\nDOCTOR: Without hope, we’d all be monsters. Come on.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THEY WALK IN, DOOR SHUTS. BEAT. TARDIS DEMATERIALISES.\nCROSSFADE TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT.

You will tell me more about him.\nNYSSA: One story, you said. And then you’d release him.\nSULTAN: Just one more, please: I’m still not sure I can trust this Doctor of yours. After all, he lied to that creature.\nNYSSA: For its own good. Didn’t that story show you anything? The Doctor’s here to help.\nSULTAN: And he is helping: I feel better for hearing his adventures than I have in many, many years. Now, girl. Tell me another story. (CLOSE TO HER) Unless, that is, you’ve finished with that silver tongue of yours — in which case (DRAWS SWORD.

(STOPPING) The teaspoon I’m using to chip away at the mortar between these blocks, for example.\nOLD MAN: What ‘teaspoon’?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. But are you doing it off your own bat — or is some external force inducing these hallucinations? (FINISHES SCRAPING) Now — is that enough, I wonder? Only one way to find out. Stand back, ‘Sultan’.\nOLD MAN: Why? What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Kick this block out of the wall, I hope.\nOLD MAN: What ‘block’? My friend, I think you are deluded.\nDOCTOR: Very (KICK; SCRAPE AS IT BUDGES) probably. (KICK; SCRAPE AS IT BUDGES; PANTING:) And one more for luck — (EFFORT)\nDOCTOR: (FX: KICK... CRUNCH AS THE BLOCK FALLS OUT OF THE WALL, INTO THE\nCORRIDOR: BEYOND)\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING BREATH) There!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 42\nOLD MAN: But.. there is a hole in the wall. How did that get there?\nDOCTOR: A moment ago, you saw no wall. Interesting.\nOLD MAN: Interesting?\nDOCTOR: It’s not your mind playing tricks — you’re being deliberately duped. And whatever’s feeding this image to you is intelligent, adaptive. Your mind couldn’t explain how my foot had disappeared into the wall, so it let you see it. Otherwise you might reject the whole thing. Very clever.\nOLD MAN: (OUTRAGED) You have kicked a hole in my wall!\nDOCTOR: I realise all this must seem terribly confusing. But it’s vital you believe me: whatever it is that’s doing this to you, I doubt has your best interests at heart. It must be linked to whatever the Gantha found. Come on, your Highness.\nOLD MAN: You want me to go through the hole?\nDOCTOR: Trust me, it’s perfectly safe. Well, until that jailer makes his next appearance.\nOLD MAN: Safe?! Fool, this is a tower! There is nothing out there but a sheer drop!\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) This may take some time.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: INT. THRONE ROOM\nSULTAN: There. I am sitting comfortably, girl. Make this story a good one and I may free your friend, the Doctor. Displease me and I may make a few edits — to your physical integrity. (CLAPS HANDS) Begin!\nNYSSA: Very well. My next story, O Merciful Sultan, takes place many centuries from now and many miles from Arabia, in a place called Norwood, near a city named London, in a year which the people of that time know as eighteen hundred and ninety-two.\nNYSSA: Imagine an ordinary house in an ordinary street where something extraordinary is taking place. A woman named Elizabeth Spinnaker lives here, almost alone. All of her servants — save for one — have run away in fear. Because there’s something in this house, you see... something that turns men’s blood to water.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 44\nSTORY: 2: THE INTERPLANETARIAN\nSTORY: SCENE 23: INT.

IT ORIGINATES, WE WILL DISCOVER, FROM THE POSSESSED NYSSA — THOUGH IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GUESS THIS IMMEDIATELY )\nSPINNAKER: (FX: CROSSING CUTLERY) Another excellent supper. Thank you, Hash gs\nHILL: Not at all, madam. I am gratified, under present circumstances, that it provided you with even the smallest shard of pleasure. Would you care for a glass of something stronger? Strictly for medicinal purposes, you understand, and to settle one’s nerves.\nSPINNAKER: Thank you. That won’t be necessary, Hill. Of course you’re most welcome to pour something for yourself. (BEAT) Though my father wouldn’t have approved.\nHILL: Indeed he would not, madam. And in honour of his memory, I shall abstain.\nHILL: The patient sounds a little vexed tonight, madam.\nSPINNAKER: I looked in on her shortly before you sounded the gong. She proved most impertinent when I made only the slightest enquiry.\nHILL: I have noticed, madam, that she is inclined to candour of the stoutest kind.\nSPINNAKER: Indeed you have. And you have my thanks for your continued tolerance.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 45\nHILL: Such thanks are quite unnecessary, madam. (BEAT) Though I was wondering...\nSPINNAKER: Yes?\nHILL: Will he be here soon? Your... specialist?\nSPINNAKER: I do hope so, though I gather that one can never be entirely certain with him. My father always said he was irremediably unpunctual.\nHILL: We do seem to have been waiting for him for rather longer than expected.\nSPINNAKER: Father told me once that there was something ironic in the man being so poor a timekeeper.\nHILL: I don’t believe I understand his meaning, madam.\nSPINNAKER: No. No, neither did I.\nSPINNAKER: (FX: FROM UPSTAIRS: MORE SHRIEKS AND WHAT SOUNDS LIKE\nFURNITURE: MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION)\nSPINNAKER: Dear me. Is that the wardrobe again?\nHILL: That would certainly seem to be a likely hypothesis, madam.\nSPINNAKER: I thought I’d asked you to bolt it to the floor.\nHILL: I did precisely as you asked, madam. But the patient must have succeeded in prising it loose. Her powers are really most impressive. As I believe I’ve remarked before, I do think she would be of tremendous interest to the Society.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: But no-one is to see her.\nHILL: Very good, madam.\nSPINNAKER: Do you know, I think she’s growing stronger?\nHILL: I fear your suspicions may be correct, madam.\nSPINNAKER: Heaven help us if she ever breaks free. Whatever would we do?\nHILL: We would do our best, madam. As we always have.\nSPINNAKER: Thank you, Hill. You are a comfort.\nHILL: One tries, madam. One does try.\nNYSSA: (FX: UPSTAIRS) (POSSESSED) (DELIGHTED SCREECH) At last!\nHILL: Madam?\nSPINNAKER: You may answer it, Hill. I shall come with you.\nHILL: Really, madam! There is no need.\nSPINNAKER: Nonsense. I only hope it isn’t Mr Laxford-Pope again. I thought I’d made it quite plain that I consider him to be far too old, that I am in no want of a husband, and that, in any case, I don’t care for his nose.\nHILL: If it is Mr Laxford-Pope, madam, he’s in a fearful hurry.\nHILL: (FX: HILL AND SPINNAKER LEAVE THE ROOM AND STEP GINGERLY TO THE DOOR.

I did hear it the first time.\nDOCTOR: I’m terribly sorry. I don’t mean to be rude but time is rather of the essence. Now, you must be Mr Hill, yes? And you must be Elizabeth! How nice to meet you in person at last.\nSPINNAKER: Who are you, sir? And why do you call upon us so late?\nDOCTOR: I was rather hoping you’d be expecting me. I’m the Doctor.\nSPINNAKER: You’re the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You sound sceptical. Surely you got my letter?\nSPINNAKER: I had been waiting for it for all of my life. But are you really him?\nDOCTOR: I’m a little hurt you doubt it.\nSPINNAKER: My father knew you decades ago. You wouldn’t have been born then.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m much older than I look. And I remember your father rather well. It was during what they call the Second Great Crookback Incursion, wasn’t it? Mesopotamia, 1843.\nSPINNAKER: You were there?\nDOCTOR: Your father was brave and honest and thoroughly respected by his men.\nSPINNAKER: If you are the Doctor then... you saved his life.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: Did I? Well, all in a day’s work.\nSPINNAKER: He always wanted me, if I were ever to meet you, to thank you.\nDOCTOR: No need. Now, while I’d like little more than to talk over old times it really is rather important I see the patient.\nSPINNAKER: Of course. (BEAT) Of course, Doctor. Come this way.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT. MAIN HALL [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: I must thank you for looking after her. I had to keep her safe, you see, but I couldn’t risk her infecting my TARDIS. So I had to leave her somewhere discreet and out of sight where she wouldn’t attract much attention.\nSPINNAKER: So you chose Norwood?\nDOCTOR: Well, Earth in the late nineteenth century, yes. (FX: ALL STOP) Has she been behaving herself?\nSPINNAKER: I fear she has not, Doctor. Though Mr Hill and I have done our best I’m afraid she’s been quite violent. We had no choice but to restrain her.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I see. Terribly sorry to hear that. So. Where’s the patient?\nHILL: I’ll take you to her, sir.\nDOCTOR: No need. Just point me in the right direction.\nHILL: Madam?\nSPINNAKER: This is the Doctor, Hill. He has the run of the house.\nHILL: Go up the stairs to the first floor, sir. You’1ll find her in the third room on the right. Just follow the sound of the screams.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. Now. Why don’t you two sit tight in the dining room? I’1l pop down again in a moment.\nSPINNAKER: You’re sure, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. Just carry on regardless. Pretend I’m not here.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: I rather think that’s my cue, don’t you? I’1ll see you shortly.\nHILL: He seems... too young, madam.\nSPINNAKER: He does, doesn’t he? But did you see his eyes?\nHILL: His eyes, madam? I confess I did not notice anything in particular about them.\nSPINNAKER: They seemed to tell some different story.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT.

Sorry to intrude.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) Greetings, Time Lord! So you dare at last to face me?\nDOCTOR: Actually, I was wondering if I could have a word with Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) The Trakenite is buried deep within us. For we are not one, Time Lord. We are legion.\nDOCTOR: Even so, I’m sure she must be in there somewhere. If you’d just let her know I’m here?\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) So you cannot steel yourself to talk with me? Many before you have quailed at the task. Be warned! I will lie. Yet I will mingle lies with truth to confound you.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. We’ll have a natter in a minute. But we’re not going any further ‘til I know that Nyssa’s safe.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) You are weak. Sentimental and soft-bellied.\nDOCTOR: It has been said. Now would you kindly put me through to Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Oh, but you are an impatient one, aren’t you? Very well — (INHALES HEAVILY — THEN EXHALES AS HERSELF) Oh. Oh. Doctor? Doctor, is that you? Where have you been?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. There you are. (FX: WALKING TO BEDSIDE) Sorry I’ve been so long. I’ve been doing a bit of digging around regarding your.. er, your condition.\nNYSSA: The parasite in my psyche, you mean.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’ll get you free of it. You’ve not been harmed, I hope? I’m so sorry you’ve had to be restrained like this.\nNYSSA: To tell you the truth, I’ve hardly felt a thing. I have had moments of consciousness, but for most of the time everything I am has been blotted out and there’s been only darkness.\nDOCTOR: (SYMPATHETICALLY) Yes.\nNYSSA: I wonder... was this what it was like for my father? This... eclipse? Or was there... more pain?\nDOCTOR: Please, don’t upset yourself.\nNYSSA: Help me, Doctor. Help me, p-[lease] (INHALES HEAVILY — AND\nWHEN: SHE EXHALES, SHE’S POSSESSED AGAIN) Time’s up, Time Lord! You have no alternative but to converse with me.\nDOCTOR: If I must. But to be frank, I only really dropped in to give you a fair chance.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) What are you trying to say, you pallid excuse for a man? Spit it out or stay silent!\nDOCTOR: Just that I wanted to give you an opportunity to vacate the body of my friend of your own free will. That is before I force you out.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED. DISMISSIVE) You? Force me out?\nDOCTOR: That’s the gist of my ultimatum, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 54\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) I am ancient, Doctor, and I have been called many things. Demon. Spectre. Spirit. Djinn. I have gone about the world since man was crawling in the slime. And I shall not leave this girl till she has perished. She is mine now, forever. My dominion over her is absolute.\nDOCTOR: We’ll see about that, won’t we? Listen, I’ve had rather a difficult day and I’ve come an awfully long way to be here. (HE TURNS TO GO) So I’1l1 think I’1l just pop downstairs to have a quick word with my friends and a nice cup of tea while you stay up here and consider your position.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) You are fleeing the scene of battle! You are\nNYSSA: running away!\nDOCTOR: Not at all. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28:\nSPINNAKER: Mr Hill?\nHILL: Madam?\nSPINNAKER: I’m not sure I’ve ever really\nSPINNAKER: Page 55\nSPINNAKER: said before now how grateful I\nSPINNAKER: am for your staying. When all the others left.\nHILL: There is no need, madam,\nSPINNAKER: Still. Thank you.\nHILL: It was only my duty.\nSPINNAKER: I suppose it must have been.\nSPINNAKER: (FX: DOCTOR IS WALKING UP FROM\nHILL: But... not only duty, madam.\nSPINNAKER: Mr Hill? Whatever do you mean?\nSPINNAKER: (FX: THE DOCTOR WALKS INTO THE\nDOCTOR: Hello you two.\nSPINNAKER: Doctor! How is she?\nDOCTOR: Not terribly well, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: for you to say so.\nDOCTOR: OUTSIDE)\nDOCTOR: ROOM)\nDOCTOR: The entity is stubborn and\nDOCTOR: deeply embedded. But I’m confident I can free her of it.\nHILL: You are, sir?\nDOCTOR: I believe I have a cure.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 56\nSPINNAKER: Mr Ransome — formerly our head butler — was adamant that medical science could provide no cure. He implored me to summon a priest.\nDOCTOR: But you refused?\nSPINNAKER: I did exactly as you told me to in your letter. But Mr Ransome left that very evening.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I was wondering if the faithful Hill was your only member of staff.\nSPINNAKER: He is the only servant who stayed.\nDOCTOR: Brave fellow.\nHILL: Thank you, sir.\nDOCTOR: I’ve just taken a break from my... consultation. I wonder if I mightn’t trouble you for a cup of tea?\nSPINNAKER: Of course.\nHILL: I’ll prepare a pot, sir.\nDOCTOR: No need to go to too much trouble. In fact, I rather thought we might use these. (FROM HIS POCKETS THE DOCTOR PRODUCES\nTHREE: TEABAGS) I picked them up on my travels.\nSPINNAKER: What are they, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Teabags. An invention from just a little after your time.\nHILL: And what do they do, sir?\nDOCTOR: It’s easy. You just place one in a cup of hot water and a second or so later... instant tea. (BEAT) No need to look so\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: suspicious. It’s just as good as proper tea. Well, almost. Take them. They won’t bite.\nHILL: (TAKING TEABAGS) Thank you, sir. I’ll prepare a cup for you. And for you, madam?\nSPINNAKER: Thank you, Hill. Yes. Why not?\nDOCTOR: And one for you too, Mr Hill. I don’t see any need to stand on ceremony, do you? Not on a day like today.\nHILL: Madam?\nSPINNAKER: I have no objections.\nHILL: Very good, madam. Doctor. (BOWS AND LAVES)\nDOCTOR: What a wonderful butler. Of course he’s terribly attached to you.\nSPINNAKER: Doctor! That is a scandalous suggestion.\nDOCTOR: Is it? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.\nSPINNAKER: I apologise, Doctor. Between you and me... I think you may be right.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT.

How better to galvanise damnation’s longueurs?\nNYSSA: (FX: FURNITURE MOVES! DRAWERS OPEN! DOORS SLAM! WINDOWS RATTLE! )\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. DINING ROOM\nSPINNAKER: Not again!\nDOCTOR: Would you mind if I sat down for a moment, Miss Spinnaker?\nSPINNAKER: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: (FX: PULLS UP CHAIR, SITS) Thank you. I’ve been on my feet for days, you see. Been doing a lot of running.\nSPINNAKER: Where have you been, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Around and about. I’ve been conducting some research on the thing that’s taken charge of my companion. And I’ve turned up something terribly interesting.\nSPINNAKER: Would you like to share your knowledge, Doctor? She has been with us for some time, after all. We have come to care for her ourselves.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s all very technical. Rather dry really. No, I’m terribly grateful for your help but I wouldn’t want to burden you with too much detail. I wouldn’t want to give you nightmares.\nSPINNAKER: Father said you were like this.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Did he?\nSPINNAKER: Evasive and mysterious and perpetually distracted as if your mind is on a different plane to ours.\nDOCTOR: Well... He was a fine man, your father. You must miss him.\nSPINNAKER: There are days when I do, Doctor. And then there are days — there are many days — when I do not.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: Ah! The excellent Mr Hill — with our tea, as requested?\nHILL: I believe I have carried out the operation correctly, sir.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you have. But the proof’s in the pudding, don’t you think?\nHILL: Here, madam. Sir.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (HE SIPS) Delicious. You’ve got it just right, Mr Hac.»\nSPINNAKER: (SIPS) It does not taste quite the same. What do you think, Hill?\nHILL: It is unusual, madam.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’ll get used to it in time. (FX: DRAWS BACK CHAIR, STANDS) Now, Miss Spinnaker, Mr Hill, I’m going to go back upstairs again and force the entity to leave the body of my friend. You may hear a lot of strange things in the next few minutes. Oaths in languages unspoken for millennia, blood- curdling cries as of the laments of the forgotten, weird ululations which strike terror into your very hearts. And so on.\nHILL: We have, in recent weeks, sir, grown accustomed to such sounds.\nDOCTOR: I know. And I’m really very sorry about that. But whatever happens in the next few moments you must not follow me into the bedroom, either of you. It could be terribly dangerous. And I think I’ve caused you enough inconvenience already.\nSPINNAKER: We understand, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: Mr Hill?\nHILL: Understood, sir.\nDOCTOR: Marvellous. (EXITING) Well, drink up. (BOUNDING UPSTAIRS\nTHROUGH: )\nHILL: (SIPPING) What a singular fellow.\nSPINNAKER: (SIPPING) Yes. You know, I’m not at all sure I approve of these ‘tea bags’, Hill.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. BEDROOM\nDOCTOR: Hello. Me again, I’m afraid.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) So you have returned, Time Lord!\nDOCTOR: I see you haven’t taken my advice. What a pity.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) If you mean to threaten me, Time Lord, then do so properly. Do not cloak your efforts at intimidation with weasel words.\nDOCTOR: I’m just trying to be polite. But I’m afraid you’ve not left me with much in the way of alternatives. I’m going to have to remove you myself.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) Try it, Time Lord. I am as old as the desert. I am as ageless as the sea. I am as potent as fire and as patient as ice. I am a spirit who has gone about this world for a thousand thousand generations and I may inhabit and consume whomsoever I choose.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I’m afraid I’m going to have to correct you on that. You see, I’ve just come from a little place not far from the Styx-Heimer Cluster called The Meellion Cube. Does that ring any bells? You’ve probably heard of the people who live there. They call themselves Lingua-Technicians.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) You’re lying.\nDOCTOR: Why would I make up a thing like that? Having spent some time on Meellion, I’ve found out rather a lot about you. You’re no ancient spirit, are you?\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) I am.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: No — you’re a peripatetic, crypto-conscious virus, floating through the galaxies and infecting people at random. Actually, it’s my suspicion you were created as some sort of scattergun weapon. For what kind of conflict you were designed... well, I'd rather not speculate.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) I am a wandering demon. I am sat at high table at the feast of the damned.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no doubt you’ve inspired the odd legend here and there. The occasional ghost story or two. But let’s be clear: there’s nothing sulphurous about you, is there? Just the familiar whiff of bad science.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) Have a care. I am an agent of the fallen. I ama Lord Lieutenant in the army of Hades.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid that won’t really wash any more. In fact, I believe I can name you.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) Name me?\nDOCTOR: Yes indeed. Aren’t you... “The Interplanetarian”?\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED. SCREECHES IN HORRIFIED DISBELIEF) Impertinent fool! You know nothing at all. Pious bungler. Gross, half- baked ignoramus!\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. Have I hit a nerve? When I visited, the people of the Meellion Cube had only lately evicted you from their world. And I’m afraid they told me how I could do the same. You’d better brace yourself. It’s a kind of stylised ritual... Slightly pompous but I’m assured it will work. There are certain... sounds of power, I suppose... which will force you from your host.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) You think mere sounds can sway me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: I think these particular ones just might. The Lingua- Technicians have instilled them in me. I need only trigger them. Now, I think I can remember the preliminaries. You’1l have to bear with me. (CLEARS THROAT) “Hear now, O vile creature, O excrescence, O cursed abomination and abhorréd cur” — (HE BREAKS OFF) Sorry about that. Don’t mean to be personal. I’m just trying to follow the instructions. Anyway. “IT cast thee out from the body of the innocent, Nyssa. I fling thee back into the abyss from whence thee came. I hurl thee into bodiless oblivion and disincarnate chaos! The power of Gallifrey compels you! The power of Omega compels you! The power of Rassilon compels you! Hear now, o Interplanetarian, this word, the word which opens the door, the word that heralds the flood.”\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) And what is that word, Doctor? Go on. Scare me.\nDOCTOR: I chose it, actually. It seemed... respectful.\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) And?\nDOCTOR: Tremas.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR OPENS HIS MOUTH AND EMITS A STREAM OF STATIC AND WHITE NOISE — OVERLAID & DIFFERENT READINGS OF ‘TREMAS’ BUILDING TO A CLIMAX)\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) No... no...

That sounds rather unpleasant.\nHILL: The disease is a tenacious and savage thing, madam. I imagine that the cure, in order to be successful, must have to match it in ferocity.\nSPINNAKER: (REACHING A DECISION) Nevertheless... I think we should go up.\nHILL: I agree, madam.\nSPINNAKER: You do? But the Doctor told us to stay down here.\nHILL: He may have done so, madam. But I flatter myself to think I know you well enough by now to be quite certain you’d never have been content to simply sit down here and quail while the Doctor and his patient fight for their lives above us.\nSPINNAKER: Hill?\nHILL: Yes, madam?\nSPINNAKER: Under the circumstances, I think you can stop calling me “madam”. (BEAT) From now on I should like you to call me... Elizabeth.\nHILL: Your father would not have approved.\nSPINNAKER: But my father isn’t here now, is he? (FX: WHITE NOISE CUTS OUT) Up we go, then?\nHILL: Up we go... Elizabeth.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. BEDROOM\nNYSSA: (POSSESSED) (GROANING) Have mercy...!

DISEMBODIED) You may have succeeded in forcing me from her but you will never destroy me. I shall go about the world again. I shall possess another. And another! And another! No creature is barred to me! Even you, Doctor! Why, I think I shall inhabit a Time Lord next. A Trakenite was tasty... but a Gallifreyan would be delicious.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re welcome to try.\nDOCTOR: (FX: WITH A HISS, THE INTERPLANETARIAN VAPORISES.

(FX: UNDOING BUCKLES) Let’s get you free of these dreadful restraints.\nNYSSA: Oh, yes please —\nDOCTOR: How’s that?\nNYSSA: Much better.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry you had to suffer all that.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 67\nNYSSA: It wasn’t your fault. Well, not really. It was... it was unfortunate. (BEAT) Where’s the Interplanetarian now?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Funnily enough, I think it’s trying to take me over. (INHALES, WEAKENING...) I can feel its tendrils rootling about in my mind. Like a kind of high-altitude headache. Unfortunately, it’s about to discover that the mind of a Time Lord is rather too complicated for it to inhabit... (EXHALES, STRONGER) Yes, I can feel it retreating.\nNYSSA: What will happen to it now?\nDOCTOR: Well. That’s the thing. You see-\nSPINNAKER: Doctor!\nHILL: Is it over, sir?\nDOCTOR: I thought I told you to stay downstairs.\nSPINNAKER: I know... but we heard such dreadful sounds. We wanted to help.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, but it’s really quite unnecessary. The danger has passed. The storm clouds have dissipated. And Nyssa is well again. Isn’t that so, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: I’m really very sorry for all the trouble I put you to. You’ve both been most hospitable.\nHILL: We have done our best, madam.\nSPINNAKER: And it is good to see you well again.\nNYSSA: Thank you. It’s good to be back amongst... nice people again.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: Well, I think we should probably be leaving. Let you two get on with your lives, let history take its natural course... all of that. Are you well enough to walk, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Some fresh air will do me good.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s get you back to the TARDIS. Goodbye then, Miss Spinnaker. Goodbye, Mr Hill.\nNYSSA: Goodbye.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. THRONE ROOM\nNYSSA: And that was how we left them, standing together in that terrible room. They had dazed looks upon their faces. As if a hurricane had blown through their lives and vanished over the horizon, leaving them stood among the wreckage. I’ve seen that look before, many times.\nSULTAN: Enough of this philosophising! Is that the finish of it? I call that a poor ending indeed.\nNYSSA: Have patience, o Sultan. You have to let the story unfold in its own time.\nSULTAN: Ah! So it is not yet over!\nNYSSA: Listen closely...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. DINING ROOM\nSPINNAKER: (FX: SETTING DOWN GLASS) Really, Mr Hill. I’m not sure I ought to have allowed myself to have been persuaded to open the bottle.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) It seemed only right, Elizabeth. Right and proper. To celebrate the departure of the Doctor and his... pal.\nSPINNAKER: To toast poor Miss Nyssa’s liberation, surely? From that awful fiend who dwelt within her.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) To toast our being alone together, then? Alone at last. Free to indulge ourselves.\nSPINNAKER: Mr Hill?\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Enough of your coy games, madam. You wish to be... possessed. I have long seen it in your eyes. A hunger which only I can satisfy. A thirst which only I can slake.\nSPINNAKER: Mr Hill! You over-reach yourself. You over-reach yourself grievously!\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Do I frighten you, my pudding?\nSPINNAKER: You offend me, sir.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Then be offended! For this is what you have agitated, madam — this is the beast that you’ve brought forth!\nSPINNAKER: I would ask you, Mr Hill, to keep your distance.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Or what? Oh, my Elizabeth, I shall teach you such [things]\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 71\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Who’s there? If it’s that fool Laxford-Pope come sniffing...\nDOCTOR: Hello. Us again.\nNYSSA: So sorry to interrupt like this.\nSPINNAKER: Doctor. What a.. relief it is to see you again.\nDOCTOR: (MOCK-INNOCENT) You haven’t seen my hat anywhere, have you? I try to keep it in my pocket but I think I must have mislaid it somewhere.\nSPINNAKER: I, er — wait, how did you regain access to this house?\nDOCTOR: (MOCK-INNOCENT) We must have accidentally left the door on the latch when we left.\nNYSSA: Elizabeth? Take my hand. Come with me.\nSPINNAKER: Nyssa? Why?\nNYSSA: Please. Trust me.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Doctor? Why is your handmaid dragging my mistress away?\nDOCTOR: Enough, Interplanetarian. Enough now.\nHILL: (POSSESSED CHUCKLE) Oh, I warned you, Doctor, did I not? You may expel me from one body but this planet teems with billions of hosts. What a smorgasbord is laid before me!\nSPINNAKER: Mr Hill? Doctor, what’s the matter with him?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: Mr Hill isn’t there at the moment, Elizabeth. Stay with Nyssa, please, and let me speak to him.\nNYSSA: Elizabeth. Anything your... friend has said to you... It’s important you understand that it wasn’t him who spoke to you.\nSPINNAKER: I.. I think I know that.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Oh, Doctor. I like this one. This... butler. He is young and strong and fit and his thoughts are filled with sentimental fantasy. Methinks I will have fun with him.\nDOCTOR: I did try to warn you, Interplanetarian.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Idle threats and hollow boasts! That ridiculous rite of yours shall not work for a second time.\nDOCTOR: No. That’s probably true. To be honest, I don’t really understand how it worked the first time around.\nNYSSA: Doctor? I have three separate theories.\nDOCTOR: We’1ll talk later, Nyssa.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) So, Time Lord, you... accept my victory?\nDOCTOR: Ah, but then I didn’t intend to use the rite again in any case. You see, the Lingua-Technicians of the Meellion Cube aren’t just masters of arcane vocabulary and esoteric terminology and supra-linguistics. They also have a lovely Sideline in making tea.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) Tea?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Lady Grey. Lapsang Souchong. A blend that tastes like blackberries if they’d been grown beneath five red suns. And, of course, they make the tea I gave to Mr Hill not half an hour ago. Well, I say tea. Technically speaking it’s... liquid code.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 73\nHILL: (POSSESSED; REELING) What have you done?\nDOCTOR: I gave you every opportunity. I’d like you to remember that. Actually, the tea’s rather a one-off. Bespoke. Run up for me on Meellion after I sorted out a spot of trouble they were having with The Covetous Shoal of Majestrix Prime.\nHILL: (POSSESSED; REELING) What is this pain in my skull?\nDOCTOR: The code’s put up a hexahedron firewall in the cerebral cortex of Mr Hill. By now, I’m afraid, escape’s impossible. The hexahedron has begun to contract. I’m sorry but it won’t stop until you’ve been entirely erased.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) You have tricked me!\nDOCTOR: Well, you shouldn’t have stayed.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) You play the lamb, Doctor, but in truth you are the tiger.\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Interplanetarian.\nNYSSA: Doctor! You’re hurting him!\nDOCTOR: Oh, the Interplanetarian’s not really alive. No. Not as we'd understand it.\nNYSSA: But does it need to suffer like that?\nDOCTOR: It’s almost over, Nyssa.\nHILL: (POSSESSED) (SCREECH.. BEAT... HEAVY EXHALATION AS HILL IS RESTORED) Good Lord. How extraordinary.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: Welcome back, Mr Hill.\nHILL: Has it gone, sir?\nDOCTOR: Gone for good. I’m sorry if that was uncomfortable for you.\nHILL: Not at all, sir. A most original experience.\nSPINNAKER: My dear, brave Mr Hill. (SHE KISSES HIM)\nDOCTOR: Ah. Right. Well, I don’t know about the rest of you. But I think we’ve all earned ourselves a cup of proper tea.\nHILL: I’1ll put the kettle on, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. THRONE ROOM\nSULTAN: So! This Doctor does hunt demons! Yes, and uses magical enchantments too!\nNYSSA: Enchantments? Oh, you mean the Lingua-Technicians’ sounds of power. Not exactly. (SUDDENLY WOOZY) And it wasn’t a demon, it was more like — like a sickness... I’m sorry, I feel a little strange.\nSULTAN: You seem unwell, girl. Are you sure this Interplanetarian has not possessed you again? I have exorcists of my own, who have blunter ways of purging devils.\nNYSSA: No! It’s just, I feel terribly, terribly... drained...\nSULTAN: Ah, you are tired? Very well — you may sleep. And, in the morning, when you awake, you shall witness the execution of your Doctor friend.\nNYSSA: What? But you can’t! One more story, you said!\nSULTAN: But where does one tale end and the next begin? Tell me more stories, about this Doctor and his adventures. If they please me, I shall release this demon-hunter. I promise.\nNYSSA: (TIRED) Alright. (BEAT, GOING INTO STORY MODE) When I first met the Doctor, he was another man entirely. (FX: FADING OUT) Tall, with wild hair and wilder eyes, and he travelled with a clever young boy named Adric...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT. DUNGEON — CELL\nOLD MAN: (PEERING OUT OF HOLE) You see, Doctor? How can we escape through the wall, when this tower is three hundred cubits high?\nDOCTOR: (GROANING) Of course — a psychological failsafe. No wonder you have an aversion to leaving. (SUDDENLY WOOZY) But please, you have to — to trust me...\nOLD MAN: (GRABBING HIM) Careful, you will fall!\nDOCTOR: I told you, all that’s through that hole is a corridor! Strange, I suddenly feel.. I don’t know, drained. Exhausted.\nOLD MAN: You are unwell? Have no fear. I have many physicians at my command. I shall have one of them prepare you a most purging—\nDOCTOR: Haven’t you been listening to anything I’ve tried to explain to you? Don’t you understand? You’re not the Sultan.\nOLD MAN: (INTERRUPTING) Ridiculous. Not to mention treasonous —\nDOCTOR: — and these aren’t your luxurious private quarters.\nOLD MAN: (SPULTTERING) Why, I only have to look out that balcony to see... (DOUBT) .. to see...\nDOCTOR: You’re starting to see it, aren’t you? This place, as it really is. A cell.\nOLD MAN: No. No. I see my private quarters! (UNCONVINCING) The lining on the walls. Gold leaf, with a turquoise inlay, to catch — (TRAILING OFF) .. catch the glimmer of the sun...\nDOCTOR: That’s it! Keep trying! You can break free if only you let yourself see the truth!\nOLD MAN: Break free? I’m not the prisoner here. You are!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: Then tell me when you last left this room.\nOLD MAN: I.. I have many engagements.\nDOCTOR: But you can’t remember them. Prove you’re free — open that door and walk out.\nOLD MAN: I’ve no reason to.\nDOCTOR: Try!\nOLD MAN: I can call my servants if I need anything.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. If this hole really does lead outside, then where’s the warmth of the sun? The scent of jasmine, the sounds of the bazaar, drifting in from the city beyond?\nOLD MAN: We... we are too high.\nDOCTOR: Too high for sound? Here: take my hand. These walls, how do they feel to the touch?\nOLD MAN: Cold, damp stone. (DAWNING) My eyes see one truth, my other senses see another.\nDOCTOR: I think you’ve been locked up here for a long, long time. Something here in this palace wants you to make sure you never, ever leave— (REELS AGAIN)\nOLD MAN: Doctor? You are unwell.\nDOCTOR: Come on — help me widen this hole.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 78\nOLD MAN: Should we not wait until you are feeling better?\nDOCTOR: (GETTING WEAKER) I don’t think that would be a terribly good idea. There’s something powerful and dangerous in this palace, and now it’s feeding off my psyche too.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 79"

I know a story about a talking horse!\nBALLADEER: Yeah, yeah, we've heard it all before.\nBESSIE: Good riddance to bad rubbish.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nNYSSA: I spilt my ramble juice, that’s all.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 97\nBESSIE: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Now — are there any more plagiarists amongst you? Cos I warn you, we hold no truck with copycats here!\nDOCTOR: I think this might be a good moment for us to leave.\nNYSSA: I agree.\nLOTTIE: Not staying, my dears? (LAUGHS) There’s many’1ll drown in yonder rain’1ll wish they stayed indoors.\nDOCTOR: Drown?\nLOTTIE: Just a joke, sir. I meant no harm. It’s rare the weather kills us in these parts. (LAUGHS & MOVES OFF)\nNYSSA: Doctor, you don’t think that man we found...?\nDOCTOR: I was thinking just the same. Soaked through.\nNYSSA: Maybe we shouldn’t be in such a hurry to get out there again?\nBESSIE: (CALLING FROM OFF) It’s a murderous night, my dears.

(LAUGHS) And that’s you, sir, just across the hallway.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nBESSIE: No trouble at all. You’ve plenty of credit left from that lovely story of yours.\nBESSIE: I hope the storm doesn’t keep you awake, my dears.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it won’t. (OBVIOUS YAWN) I’m surprisingly tired...\nBESSIE: Then I’1l1 bid you a good night.\nNYSSA: Good night. (FX: BESSIE HEADS DOWNSTAIRS )\nDOCTOR: Well, then — I suppose we’d better turn in.\nNYSSA: Not going to catch up on your bedtime reading?\nDOCTOR: What-? Oh, the joke book. (FX: FLICKS PAGES) Yes, it all seems terribly amusing. (YAWNING AGAIN) But I really am very tired.\nNYSSA: (LAUGHS) Goodnight, then, Doctor. Sweet dreams! (FX: DOOR SHUTS.

Don’t want him getting away before we've had a chance to sell him.\nBALLADEER: (TYING DOCTOR) D’you think we’ll get a good price for him, then?\nBESSIE: I reckon him and his little friend have an endless store of tales. They’1ll be worth a fortune to the right buyer.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO, TO SELF) What does she mean, ‘right buyer’?\nBALLADEER: (OFF) There, that’s him trussed up. (CHUCKLES PROUDLY) Suppose we'd better go and fetch his girlfriend now?\nNYSSA: (INTAKE OF BREATH) Oh no-!\nBESSIE: Hold your horses!\nBESSIE: Little thing like that, I can manage her alone.

Now, put your arms into the docking harness...\nBALLADEER: It’s too tight.\nBESSIE: (IRRITABLY) Stay still while I plug you into the mainframe...\nBALLADEER: (LAUGHS) Oh — that tickles!\nBESSIE: Stop being silly! You do this every night.\nBALLADEER: Do I...?\nBESSIE: Right, then.

Kill old Lottie? No, Bess, no!\nBESSIE: Ah, but who listens to her tales? Besides, that pipe’1ll finish her, soon enough.\nLOTTIE: (COUGHS) That’s right, dearie. (COUGHS) No-one listens to old Lottie.\nBESSIE: Now, you go back up there the way you came — and remember, you didn’t see nothing.\nLOTTIE: (EXITING UPSTAIRS) Thank you! Thank you!\nBESSIE: (TO BALLADEER) And as for you — you get on with uploading the rest of tonight’s tales. There’s traffickers from Trafiska arriving soon by sea who’ll pay the best prices for some of these.\nBALLADEER: Right you are, Bess.

Well, I would have been, had I drunk the ramble juice.\nNYSSA: You knew it was drugged-?\nDOCTOR: A hint of sediment in the bottom of the glass. That’s why I knocked yours over. (MOVING OVER TO BALLADEER) Yes, by the looks of this technology, we’re dealing with a far more advanced race than the Irrideans.\nNYSSA: Why is the Balladeer recording everyone’s stories? In fact, how is he recording them?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR: Some sort of brain implant, I presume. [Highly illegal, I’m sure, in a culture such as this —]\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Doctor, there’s someone coming down the stairs!\nDOCTOR: Quickly, we’d better hide —\nLOTTIE: (DISTINCTIVE COUGH) Don’t you move on my account, m’dears.\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello Lottie.

Honestly, it’s enough to give one a sore throat.\nNYSSA: Lottie?\nLOTTIE: (CROSSING OVER TO THE MAINFRAME) It’s alright, I left the innkeeper chasing my trail around the house before I doubled back.\nDOCTOR: It seems we may have underestimated you.\nLOTTIE: Most do.

I’ve waited a jolly long time for this.\nDOCTOR: For what?\nLOTTIE: Plagiary — an ugly word for an ugly act. But stories being worth what they are on Fabula, it’s mournfully widespread.\nNYSSA: Fabula?\nDOCTOR: The Planet of Tales! Of course!\nNYSSA: There’s a planet of jokes and a planet of tales?\nDOCTOR: It’s a big universe.\nLOTTIE: There’s been a terrific push of late to stamp out this kind of illegal trafficking. Now, thanks to you, we have the evidence we need — (FX: REMOVES PIPE FROM MAINFRAME) on this memory pin.\nNYSSA: Your pipe is a memory pin?\nLOTTIE: Good disguise, eh? No one likes to get too close to a smelly old pipe, my dear! (LAUGHS) Now — if you would be so kind — the book I saw you with in the bar?\nDOCTOR: I’ve lost it, I’m afraid. I dropped it when they carried me downstairs.\nLOTTIE: That is a setback!\nNYSSA: I picked it up, actually. (FX: PRODUCES BOOK & HANDS TO LOTTIE) Here. Is it important?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 107\nLOTTIE: It most certainly is! (MOVED) Alas! My poor Clive! He was the sweetest soul that ever lived. (SNIFFS)\nNYSSA: Your poor Clive? Then the dead man on the cliffs — he was...?\nLOTTIE: My life companion. We joined the force together. (FX: FLICKING PAGES) This was his book of codes. (MOVED) We wrote it long ago in happier times...\nNYSSA: I’m so sorry.\nLOTTIE: He died in the line of duty. He would have wanted it that way...\nLOTTIE: We'd better move these barrels pretty smartish or you’ll be sold to privateers tonight.\nDOCTOR: The barrels? Why, what’s in them?\nLOTTIE: Who knows? Beer, I should imagine. Come on! Don’t dilly dally! No time for dawdlers!\nLOTTIE: Now... (SEARCHING) My intelligence suggests there should be some sort of switch to unlock the mechanism... (CLICK) There!\nNYSSA: A tunnel!\nDOCTOR: Underneath an inn. I’m guessing it must be an old smuggling route.\nLOTTIE: No time for guessing. Come on! (CALLING BACK AS SHE EXITS DOWN TUNNEL) And hurry! Bessie’1ll be back before you can say Jack Robinson, and then we’ll all be in the soup.\nNYSSA: (TO DOCTOR) I can’t help thinking, Doctor, that Lottie made a lot more sense when she was mad.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: Come along, Nyssa —\nBESSIE: Balladeer! Balladeer!

I take it you didn’t move them barrels?\nBALLADEER: (DEFENSIVELY) How could I? I was strapped into this thing.\nBESSIE: Cease your whining and arm yourself. You follow them into the tunnel; I’1ll head them off at the beach!\nBALLADEER: (TO HIMSELF) I was having such a nice dream, too.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: EXT.

How do we get to it?\nLOTTIE: Climb, my dears, climb! (EFFORT, GRABS ON TO CLIFF & BEGINS CLIMBING)\nDOCTOR: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

(FX: COCKING LASER\nMUSKET: )\nDOCTOR: Lottie, this isn’t the way! (CLIMBS DOWN) Balladeer, let’s make a deal.\nBALLADEER: A deal?\nDOCTOR: A story, in exchange for Nyssa?\nBALLADEER: What sort of story?\nDOCTOR: How about an adventure story? I have a thousand and one exciting tales from foreign lands, you know.\nBALLADEER: A thousand and one? Why, that’d make me rich!\nDOCTOR: Obviously, I don’t have time to tell them all right now. But if you let Nyssa go, and lead us to safety?\nBALLADEER: We have a bargain. (RELEASING NYSSA) There you go, missy.\nNYSSA: Thank you. And thank you, Doctor.\nLOTTIE: (JUMPING DOWN) Trouble’s coming.\nDOCTOR: Trouble?\nLOTTIE: There: out to sea.\nNYSSA: What is it, Doctor?\nBALLADEER: That’ll be the sea monster. I’ve heard tell it rises with glowing eyes upon the waves and eats men whole on nights like this.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 111\nLOTTIE: Rubbish! That’s a fairy story concocted people off the shore at night.

Anyone who aided our escape would have a ream of tales to\nDOCTOR: fascinate and entertain...\nBALLADEER: Stories of my own?\nDOCTOR: Stories of your own.\nBALLADEER: (THINKING) I’ve never had a story of my\nBALLADEER: own before...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: EXT.

THEN QUICKLY STOPS HIMSELF TO PONDER: ) Actually, I rather like the sound of that...\nNYSSA: Then help us!\nBALLADEER: I s’pose.. there is another way would cut Bess out...\nBESSIE: (CALLING) Balladeer? What’s keeping you? Balladeer!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. TAVERN (LATER)\nDOCTOR: . and so it was they escaped to safety with the evidence.\nNYSSA: Helped, of course, by the valiant Balladeer — who from that day on was able to make an honest trade, telling tales of his own!\nBESSIE: That was a good yarn.\nARCHIE: A rare tale!\nBALLADEER: (LAUGHING) The ramble juice, it seems, is on you, sir!\nDOCTOR: I’m glad you liked it.\nBALLADEER: And there’s plenty of credit left for victuals too. What will it be..?\nNYSSA: Oh, well — er...\nLOTTIE: (OLD, MAD VOICE. CUTTING IN) Shame you’re not staying, my dears. (IN RP. SOTTO) Best be leaving, Doctor, Nyssa.\nBESSIE: You two ain’t going, are you?\nDOCTOR: Afraid so. It’s time that we were on our way. Come along, Nyssa. (MOVING OFF. SOTTO) Lottie: are you sure Bessie can’t recall a thing?\nLOTTIE: (SOTTO) Her memory’s been downloaded into the mainframe and then wiped as punishment for her crimes. The Balladeer’s the innkeeper now.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 116\nBALLADEER: (OFF) Come on, Archie, what’s your poison?\nARCHIE: (OFF) Tell us a tale, first, Balladeer — you know we love to hear of your adventures.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) And with stories of his own, it seems.\nLOTTIE: (SOTTO) Jolly well done all round, I think. Still, it is a shame that poor Clive never got to be the hero.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Oh, I don’t know: without him, we’d never have found you. Clive started the whole thing, so in a way he is the hero.\nLOTTIE: (SOTTO) Good old, Clive. He’d have liked that.\nBALLADEER: (CALLS) Lottie, leave our poor guests alone, or I’1l throw you out — storm or no storm.\nLOTTIE: (IN CHARACTER) I didn’t do them any harm... I was only telling them a tale...

(STRIDES\nFORWARD: )\nOLD MAN: This place, I remember now. All these odds and ends, the detritus of life...\nDOCTOR: Wreckage, scavenged from a crashed Gantha ship. (EXAMINING THE BEACON) Hmm. Power’s failing. How long’s it been here for, I wonder?\nOLD MAN: (IN HIS OWN WORLD) There was a madman. Nomads found him wandering in the desert and brought him to their Sultan...\nDOCTOR: (OBLIVIOUS) That’s odd. The settings have been changed. The Gantha wouldn’t have a hope of finding it on this frequency. Maybe it was damaged in transit?\nOLD MAN: He claimed to have fallen from the heavens, in a ship that travelled among the stars...\nDOCTOR: I need to find the flight recorder... (RUMMAGES & FINDS IT) Yes, here it is. Let’s see now...\nOLD MAN: I had the pieces of his vessel recovered, and brought to the palace, along with this ‘traveller’.\nDOCTOR: Aha! (COMPUTER BLEEPS) Yes, it seems there was an accident in transit, forcing them to crash-1land...\nOLD MAN: I wanted to question him. Instead, he questioned me...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR: ‘Crew killed on impact, cargo still intact’. What cargo? What were they carrying?\nOLD MAN: A djinn, that’s what he was. Sent by the Great Deceiver to beguile me. To steal away my soul...\nDOCTOR: What? I don’t believe it: the idiots!\nOLD MAN: He became me, and I became the madman...\nDOCTOR: A Shanakee. They were transporting a live Shanakee!\nOLD MAN: . a madman, thrown in a cell at the imposter’s command, to be forgotten by all.\nDOCTOR: It must have been looking for a way off-world ever since. That’s why the beacon was still live — even on the wrong frequency — the Shanakee was using it to lure a space traveller here!\nOLD MAN: A traveller, yes...\nDOCTOR: (NOTICING THE OLD MAN AGAIN & REAPPRAISING) I owe you an apology, your highness. You were telling the truth, after all.\nOLD MAN: Was I?\nDOCTOR: The Shanakee has a very special gift. Given enough information, it can steal another person’s psyche. Quite literally, become that other person!\nOLD MAN: I do not understand...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR: It learned all about you. And when it had learned enough, it became you. Now it’s trying to do the same to me, worming its way into my psyche! But how? Where’s it getting the information from?\nOLD MAN: Not where, Doctor: whom. It was my vizier, Nazar, who told the traveller all about me. He has a weakness for boasting about my achievements.\nDOCTOR: (GROANS) Nyssa! Of course. It’s been draining Nyssa of the knowledge it needs, in order to escape!\nOLD MAN: Escape? But how?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see? It wants to become me, so it can steal my TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 121"

I was not a young man when the djinn cursed me. If what you say is true, then I must be more than a hundred and fifty!\nDOCTOR: That ship we found. It has the means to keep its captives alive longer than is natural. The Gantha don’t risk losing their prize to illness or old age. The creature used it to keep you alive. I don’t know why: maybe it needed your body pattern to maintain its own.\nOLD MAN: I have sons, Doctor. Wives. Daughters.\nDOCTOR: All dead, I’m afraid. The Shanakee wouldn’t have tolerated competition. The best we can hope is that they died of old age.\nOLD MAN: A devil, that is what this thing is! It steals away the years of my life, murders my family, removes me from the world, and denies me a natural death!\nDOCTOR: I’d been told they were a legend, the Shanakee — that they never existed. There’s certainly no evidence they ever did. No home world, no technology. The tale goes they can take on the outer form of any other species, like a new skin.\nOLD MAN: A ghul! A ghul from the deepest reaches of Jahannam! Feeding off the flesh of those who should be dead! I should have ordered its head struck from its accursed [body-] (GASPS)\nDOCTOR: (GOING TO HIS AID) Easy. I’ve got you.\nOLD MAN: (WEAK, IN PAIN) I feel... The years that were frozen in me.. now they have returned...\nDOCTOR: It’s abandoning the identity it stole from you. The link to your mind is being severed. And leaving that cell means... Well, it means I should never have taken you with me.\nOLD MAN: (WEAK, IN PAIN) You... you should go...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: I’1ll take you back. The psychic field will keep you alive until I figure something else out.\nOLD MAN: (WEAK, IN PAIN) No, you will go. Save yourself. Save your friend. Before your years are stolen from you as mine were.\nDOCTOR: Honoured Sultan, I can’t let you die!\nOLD MAN: (WEAK, DYING) You are right, my friend: you cannot let me die... even if you wanted to. A great Sultan needs no one’s permission. He controls everything — how to live and when to die. I choose this moment. Thank you for setting me free, my friend. All will be well.

Finally, I meet you, although it feels like we know one another already.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it does. Nyssa, just how much did you tell this creature about me?\nNYSSA: More than I imagined, it seems. What is he, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He’s a Shanakee, (TO SULTAN) aren’t you? I was never entirely convinced your species existed.\nSULTAN: We are rare, that is true.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: And all the harder to spot, I suppose, because of your habit of hiding yourself in other’s lives.\nSULTAN: We don’t just hide in the lives we take on. We live them fully. Learn from them. Live them better than those born to them. I know this to be true: I’ve lived many lives.\nDOCTOR: And now you want to try the life of a Time Lord? Do you intend to lock me in a cell, too, like you did with the real Sultan?\nSULTAN: I did him a kindness! I am not in the habit of taking lives, just in assuming them. It was always my intention to give him back his life. I set up the beacon to bring to me a means of escape. I never thought it would take so long.\nDOCTOR: Trapped on Earth. I know how that feels. But I can help you. Name your destination, I'll take you there.\nNYSSA: Doctor, no!\nDOCTOR: What do you say?\nSULTAN: It is a generous offer. All the more so, coming from one so Similar to myself...\nDOCTOR: Then we’re agreed?\nNYSSA: No, don’t trust him!\nSULTAN: . but I regret, I must decline. This human life.

Have you?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: You've been coming here for a few days. Not trying to steal, not even begging. And certainly not buying anything. So why do you come here?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR:\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: I’m not sure. I think I’m waiting for someone. A friend, maybe. Or looking for something I’ve lost. (A THOUGHT) Or had stolen from me...\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: See? Thieves everywhere. So what did you lose?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: I’m not sure. I think it might have been some kind of box. A blue box.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 139\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: Well, I haven’t seen it, but if I hear anything about a missing blue box, I’ll let you know.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: Thank you. You’re very kind.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: And don’t I know it. Here — take this. (JANGLE OF COINS) Get yourself something to eat. You look like you need a good meal.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: Thank you.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: (SHOUTING AFTER HIM) But don’t be coming back here thinking you'll get any more!\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM (LANDED)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS DOOR OPENS, WIND AND CRASHING OF WATER ON ROCKS — LOUD)\nNYSSA: (VOICE RAISED OVER NOISE) Doctor? What about here?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: (VOICE RAISED OVER NOISE) Interesting... but not interesting enough. Close the door, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (MOVING BACK INSIDE) That’s what you said the last three times we landed! Aren’t we ever going to leave the TARDIS?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR:\nNYSSA: When we find somewhere worth seeing. Why would I settle for a rocky beach? Even if it is in the sky. (FX: TARDIS DOORS CLOSE) Nothing to see here.\nNYSSA: Then choose somewhere else! But you never do, these days. You just close the door and we leave again!\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: I do not need a reason! All of time and space is out there, Nyssa. I need to find a place where I can... prove myself.\nNYSSA: Prove yourself?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: As the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: EXT. SPICE MERCHANTS’ QUARTER (MORNING)\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: Oh, it’s you again. Found your blue box yet?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: Not so far.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: Well, I haven’t seen it. And I hope you’re not here looking for another hand-out. Business has been slow these last few days, what with the sultan gone and stories about lights in the sky.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: Lights?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: Strangest thing. And now there’s strangers, too — real foreign types — in the city as well. Friends of yours, maybe?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-—-BEGGAR: I don’t think so.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: They’re asking a lot of questions about someone. I think it’s you.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: DOCTOR-AS-BEGGAR: They know me?\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: I don’t think you should speak to them. They don’t seem — (GASPS, SEEING THEM) Merciful One, here they are now!\nGANTHA: 1: Non-human lifeform detected.\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: (HARSHLY, OUT LOUD) Good-for-nothing son of a hundred desert curs! Away with you!\nDOCTOR: (BACKING OFF) Yes... thank you...\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 142\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: (HARSHLY, LOUDLY) Yes, go! Do you not see these fine foreign- looking gentlemen coming this way? Do you think they want to find a foul-smelling wretch like you in their path! (URGENTLY, WARNING) Go! Go now!\nGANTHA: 2: (APPROACHING) Closing on non-human lifeform.\nDOCTOR: They are. They’re looking at me!\nGANTHA: 1: There! Capture it.\nGANTHA: (FX: ENERGY WEAPON POWERED UP AND FIRED. ALARM FROM\nSTALLHOLDERS: )\nWOMAN STALLHOLDER: (SADLY) I told you to go!\nGANTHA: 2: Specimen acquired undamaged. Scanning...\nDOCTOR: (COMING ROUND) Uuuhhh...\nGANTHA: 1: Urgent update: acquisition is not Shanakee specimen type! Re- determining acquisition’s identity!\nGANTHA: 2: Species confirmed. (IN ALARM) Time Lord! He needs treatment.\nDOCTOR: Time Lord..? Treatment..? (PASSES OUT)\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS DOOR SLAMMING SHUT, TWO STEPS OF FOOTSTEPS RUSHING IN)\nNYSSA: Doctor? We can’t leave them like that!\nCRYING WOMAN: (OUTSIDE DOOR, MUFFLED) Doctor? Please! What will we do? Tell us what to do!\nCRYING WOMAN: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: It’s time to go. Help me with the controls. Quickly, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Help you? Why aren’t you helping them?!\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: Now, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Doctor! We spent so long looking for somewhere to go, somewhere interesting enough and now you’re running away?!\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: The controls! We’re going somewhere else. Anywhere else.\nCRYING WOMAN: (OFF, MORE URGENT) You can’t leave us! They’re coming back, Doctor. The monsters are coming back!!!\nNYSSA: No! I’m not leaving. I don’t understand how you can. Ever Since you —\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: (ANGRY) Since I what?\nNYSSA: Regenerated. You don’t just seem different. It’s like... you’re wrong.\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: I am the Doctor!\nCRYING WOMAN: (CRYING) Doctor, Nyssa, please-\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 144\nNYSSA: (SHAKEN) Did — did you hear that?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: I heard nothing.\nNYSSA: You don’t even act like the Doctor anymore.\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: I am better! There is no role I can’t play better!\nNYSSA: Role? What are you talking about?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR:\nNYSSA: You did this to me! You fooled me, made me believe, made me go to these places. Why does everyone need saving? Everywhere we go.. it’s the same. Why?\nNYSSA: It’s what you do. It’s who you are!\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: This is not who I’m supposed to be! I need — need to change.\nNYSSA: Change?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: Change back! (PAINED) It’s the only — only way...\nNYSSA: Your face, it’s — Wait. Wait! I’ve seen this before.\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: (BREATHLESS, PAINED) Not enough time to prepare. Not enough energy. I can’t change. I can’t change back!\nNYSSA: I remember. I can’t believe I forgot him. All this time.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 145 SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: (PAINED) I need more time!\nNYSSA: It’s not time you need. It’s the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: EXT. SPICE MERCHANTS’ QUARTER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS MATERIALISATION, MARKET SOUNDS OFF, TARDIS DOOR OPENING)\nNYSSA: (SHOUTING) Doctor! Doctor! (TO SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR) Come on, you.\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: (CONFUSED) Where are we going? Wait, this place seems familiar...\nNYSSA: (SLIGHTLY OFF, ADDRESSING STALLHOLDERS) You! Boy! Yes, you! Have you seen a fair-haired man, with a piece of celery in his lapel?\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: Earth. This is Earth!\nNYSSA: Celery, yes! Have you seen him? Someone must have seen him! (TO SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR) It’s no use. We’1l have to try another part of the city —\nDOCTOR: (CALLING FROM OFF) No need for that, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nNYSSA: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR: The Doctor, yes. The other me — aah! (TERRIFIED BY SIGHT OF:)\nGANTHA: 1: Non-human life forms detected.\nDOCTOR: Please, don’t be alarmed. They’re the Gantha. They’re friends. Well, friendly, at least.\nNYSSA: Doctor! (EMBRACING HIM) I’m so sorry. I forgot you! I forgot everything about you.\nDOCTOR: I went one further and forgot myself. The Gantha helped restore me to my former self. How long were you away?\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 147\nNYSSA: Too long. He tried to change again, and then it all came back. The spell was lifted, and we came back here — the coordinates were still in the databank.\nDOCTOR: I’m very glad to hear it. I have missed you, rather.\nNYSSA: I know, it’s been weeks.\nDOCTOR: For you, perhaps. It’s been three years, for me.\nNYSSA: Three years!\nDOCTOR: One thousand and one nights, to be exact. And helpful as they’ve been, the Gantha aren’t exactly the most scintillating company.\nDOCTOR: SULTAN-AS-DOCTOR:\nDOCTOR: (BABBLING) Nyssa? Do you remember that time we went to the Darhastarian Fields? No, not you. And not me. I had another face. An old face on a young man. Was that you, or me? Doctor? Doctor...? (BEGINS TO WEEP, THROUGH: )\nGANTHA: 1: This Shanakee is... damaged.\nNYSSA: What’s happened to him, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It would take a Shanakee a lifetime to accumulate enough energy to change his form. He tried too early. Now, I think, he has all the memories of his lives and mine confused. He doesn’t know who he is. I tried to warn him. Why did he try to change?\nNYSSA: He couldn’t help. He couldn’t be you. There’s only one Doctor.\nGANTHA: 2: He is no use to us now.\nGANTHA: 1: He is no use to anyone. It would be a mercy to destroy him.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 148\nNYSSA: No, you mustn’t! I know he did something terrible, but all the same-!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa’s right. Besides, I have a better idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: INT. ALIEN HOSPITAL\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: (APPROACHING) .. maintain current treatment. We can explore psycho-surgery options if necessary, but I’d rather see how the counselling goes. We have a new arrival, I hear?\nALIEN NURSE: Yes, doctor. Came in yesterday. (FX: BLEEP OF DATA DEVICE ACTIVATING) Species: Shanakee. Initial diagnosis: complete psychological breakdown.\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: (WITH INTEREST) A Shanakee! I thought they were a myth. Let’s have a look at him, shall we?\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: (FX: VIEWING SLOT OPENED, QUIET URGENTLY-BABBLING VOICE\nFILTERING: OUT FROM ROOM BEYOND)\nSULTAN: (BABBLING, DELIRIOUS) .. Agrippina 4 has seven moons, not nine, as is commonly thought.

I have a Signed and completed copy of it somewhere in the TARDIS library... ]\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: Oh, he is in a bad way, isn’t he? What do we know about him?\nALIEN NURSE: Delivered by the Gantha, it says here.\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: The Gantha! It’s not like them to take on charity jobs.\nDOCTOR WHO: 1,001 NIGHTS (FINAL) Page 150\nALIEN NURSE: A special job for a special client, apparently. Payment for all his medical expenses guaranteed in perpetuity.\nALIEN PSYCHIATRIST: Someone certainly wants him looked after. And just as well. I think he’ll be with us for a very long time to come. (FX:\nDOCTOR: & NURSE WALKING AWAY, VOICE FADING) Schedule him in for tomorrow. We’1ll start him off gently — a brief exploratory skim across the surface of the super-ego, and maybe a peek into the id, to see what’s going on in there...\nSULTAN: (STILL BABBLING) .. so many stories, so many tales to tel1l1..\nSULTAN: THE END"
