I didn’t know he’d used the TARDIS instruments.\nNYSSA: He must have used a Block Transfer Computation.\nDOCTOR: He would have known how — the Master showed him, on Castrovalva. That computation would have physically permeated the TARDIS innards and stuck, sitting in the navigation codes, waiting until we passed close to a CVE.\nTEGAN: But Adric wanted to return to Terradon, not Alzarius.\nDOCTOR: He needed a point of reference, for navigation. Alzarius would have been the only point in E-Space that he could mathematically locate.\nTURLOUGH: Can’t we use the same program to go back?\nDOCTOR: It was a one-way calculation.\nTEGAN: And is the TARDIS up to it anyway?

It protects us from severe external forces. Shock, pressure, extreme heat or cold, radiation... It’s crystalline, so holding it up to the light would show any flaws. But... no.\nNYSSA: Doctor, are we staying here?\nDOCTOR: Until I’ve performed a full diagnostic, at least. Why?\nNYSSA: Adric often talked about how the ecology of Alzarius changed every fifty years or so.\nDOCTOR: Mistfall.

Just in case.\nSOLUS: (FX: TWO CITIZENS RACK THEIR ENERGY WEAPONS, WHICH POWER UP, READY TO FIRE.)\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 14\nMISTFALL: 7. FOREST TRACK\nTURLOUGH: Marshmen?\nNYSSA: Violent creatures, Adric said. They hibernate in the water of the marshes, and emerge during Mistfall. There are other fauna as well. Giant spiders. Poisonous apparently.\nTURLOUGH: And it looks so picturesque for now. So much colour. When it wakes up, not so — [pretty.]\nTURLOUGH: (FX: ENERGY WEAPON FIRES IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE. TURLOUGH IS HIT AND GOES DOWN HEAVILY. )\nNYSSA: Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: (IN PAIN) My leg! (WINCES) Gah, it feels... I can’t move it!\nNYSSA: Can you stand? If I support you?\nTURLOUGH: (TRIES TO STAND, FALLS BACK) No! My leg’s totally numb.\nTURLOUGH: (FX: PUSHING ASIDE FOLIAGE, A CITIZEN GUARD WALKS TOWARDS US FROM THE NEAR DISTANCE, HEFTING A WEAPON. HE RACKS IT,\nPOWERING: UP THE NEXT ROUND READY TO FIRE.)\nCITIZEN GUARD: (APPROACHING) Both of you, stay completely still. You, try to run and you’1ll get what he got.\nNYSSA: Why did you shoot at us? Who are you?\nCITIZEN GUARD: That’s right. Play the innocent. But you’re not going to be causing us any more trouble. Put your hands — [up] [REACTS IN PAIN, FALLS]\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 15\nTURLOUGH: What happened to him?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. He put his hand to his neck... There’s a red mark.\nDRELL: (CLOSE BY) He is sleeping.\nDRELL: The sap of the night vine does this.\nFARA: (APPROACHING) What my friend is trying to say is that he hit him with a sleeping dart, a strong soporific. He’ll be unconscious for hours.\nTURLOUGH: Is that... a catapult?\nDRELL: I do not know this word. (BEAT) You are staring.\nNYSSA: Sorry. Lt’s Just.\nFARA: Don’t be alarmed by Drell’s appearance. He is an Haragi. [PRON. HAR-AGGY] The tattoos that cover his body are an adornment of his people. They tell the story of his bloodline.\nNYSSA: Who are you?\nFARA: My name is Yan Fara, and I’m a New Alzarian.\nNYSSA: A ‘new’ Alzarian?\nFARA: Let’s continue this conversation somewhere safer, shall we, um... ?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 16\nTURLOUGH: Turlough.\nNYSSA: And I’m Nyssa.\nTURLOUGH: I still can’t feel my leg...\nFARA: The feeling will return, Turlough. You were hit with a stun round. Here, let me help you.\nNYSSA: (TAKING TURLOUGH’S OTHER ARM) I’1l1 help.\nTURLOUGH: (WINCING WITH PAIN) Why did he shoot at us?\nFARA: He thought you were with us.\nTURLOUGH: Eh?\nFARA: Questions later. Let’s get out of here.\nDRELL: I will make sure this guard is unharmed.\nFARA: Okay, catch us up.\nFARA: (FX: FARA, NYSSA AND TURLOUGH HEAD OFF INTO THE TREES. DRELL\nKNEELS: BY THE CITIZEN GUARD, TURNS HIM OVER. )\nDRELL: You sleep, yes. And now at my hand you will sleep forever.\nDRELL: Die. As your kind will all soon die.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 17\nMISTFALL: 8. RIVERSIDE\nMISTFALL: (FX: DOCTOR AND TEGAN ARE WALKING ALONG A GRASS PATH NEXT TO A RIVER. )\nDOCTOR: Not much further. The forest should open up shortly... Oh.\nTEGAN: It’s not all a garden paradise, then.\nDOCTOR: That’s odd. The other side of the river, it’s like nothing is growing.\nTEGAN: Dead trees as far as the eye can see. Right up to the hills.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t see this before. But then again, we didn’t explore far.\nTEGAN: Here’s something that might interest you even more. Look. Tyre tracks.\nDOCTOR: Made recently too.\nTEGAN: So we’re not alone here?\nDOCTOR: It would seem not.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) (MOVING AWAY) Let’s see where they lead.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 18\nMISTFALL: 9. MARSHLANDS\nSOLUS: How’s it going down there?\nSOLUS: (FX: ARANA UNFASTENS AND REMOVES HER HELMET. THERE IS A HISS OF OXYGEN AS THE SEAL IS BROKEN. )\nARANA: All done. The others are just about ready to come up.\nSOLUS: Good! Right you lot, I want -\nDOCTOR: (FROM DISTANCE) You there! You!\nSOLUS: Who the devil... ?\nSOLUS: (FX: THE DOCTOR APPROACHES AT A PACE ACROSS DIRT AND MUD, TEGAN IN TOW. )\nTEGAN: (MIDDLE DISTANCE, APPROACHING) Doctor, do you think we should go rushing in like this?\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Just what do you think you’re doing?\nSOLUS: Weapons ready!\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) That’s close enough!\nDOCTOR: Please, I’m the Doctor, this is Tegan.\nTEGAN: (NERVOUS) Hi...\nDOCTOR: We mean you no harm, but you need to get your people out of the water...\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 19\nTEGAN: It’s dangerous!\nSOLUS: Oh, really?\nDOCTOR: There are creatures in that marsh. Dormant, but if you disturb them...\nSOLUS: Creatures. You mean the Marshmen.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) You know about the Marshmen?\nSOLUS: They’re why we’re here.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 20\nMISTFALL: 10. FOREST TRACK\nMISTFALL: (FX: FARA AND NYSSA HELPING TURLOUGH ALONG THE TRACK. SLOW PROGRESS. )\nDRELL: Not far now.\nFARA: You said you came here by accident?\nNYSSA: A kind of crash landing.\nFARA: A very unfortunate accident to land on Alzarius.\nFARA: (CONTINUED) Drell. Was he alright?\nDRELL: He will sleep for a long time.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 21\nMISTFALL: 11. MARSHLANDS\nDOCTOR: Why are you here? Tell me.\nDOCTOR: (FX: TWO DIVERS BREAK THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND COME ASHORE. )\nSOLUS: We'll continue this conversation in a moment. (TO EVERYONE) They’re coming up! I want this to run as smooth as clockwork. Get ready!\nDOCTOR: Whatever you’re doing — don’t.\nSOLUS: Keep those two at gunpoint. Stun them if they get in the way!\nSOLUS: (FX: A PEAK IN ACTIVITY. SEVERAL CITIZENS RUNNING TO THEIR POSITIONS. THE REMAINING THREE DIVERS EMERGE FROM THE WATER. )\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) (TO EVERYONE) Okay, here they come!\nSOLUS: (FX: THE EMERGING DIVERS, MOVING TOWARDS LAND, ARE SLOWED BY\nHEAVY: OBJECTS THEY ARE CARRYING BETWEEN THEM. )\nTEGAN: Doctor, what are those things they’re carrying?\nDOCTOR: This is bad. Very bad.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DIVERS CONTINUE ONTO DRY LAND AND TOWARDS THE TRANSPORTER. )\nTEGAN: But what are they? They’re like... giant wet beanbags.\nDOCTOR: The material is a collagen membrane. Those pods contain living beings — dormant Marshmen.\nTEGAN: I think I can make out the shape of... something... inside there. All curled up.\nSOLUS: Well done, everyone. Okay, quick as you like, get them into the back of the transporter, into the container.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 22\nMISTFALL: (FX: DIVERS AND CITIZENS CARRY THE PODS UP A RAMP AND INTO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. THEY ARE PLACED IN A WATER TANK. )\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) Gently... Gently!\nDOCTOR: When they wake up, they’re going to be very angry.\nSOLUS: They won’t wake up until we want them to. (CALLS TO HIS TEAM) Okay, lock it up! We need to get them back to base as quickly as we can.\nTEGAN: What are you going to do with them?\nSOLUS: More questions. You know, I could have you two arrested. This planet is out of bounds by Decider Decree seven-eight-six. Tell me what you’re doing here.\nDOCTOR: Did you just say ‘Decider’... ?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 23\nMISTFALL: 12. FARA’S CAMP\nMISTFALL: (FX: NYSSA, TURLOUGH, FARA AND DRELL COME OUT OF A PATCH OF\nFOLIAGE: INTO A CLEARING. A DIRT PATH UNDERFOOT. )\nFARA: (APPROACHING) It’s over here. We use this greenery as camouflage...\nFARA: (FX: HE PULLS ON A SWATHE OF VEGETATION THAT FALLS AWAY FROM THE SIDE OF HIS SPACECRAFT. )\nNYSSA: A spacecraft?\nFARA: Just a planet hopper. A birthday present from my parents. Not much to it, but being small makes it easier to hide.\nFARA: (CONTINUED) In you go.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 24\nMISTFALL: 13. FARA’S SHIP. (CONTINUOUS)\nMISTFALL: (FX: A COMPACT INTERIOR ACOUSTIC. ONE OR TWO INSTRUMENTS\nTICKING: OVER. NYSSA, WITH FARA AND DRELL HELPING TURLOUGH, ENTER FROM THE FOREST. )\nFARA: (ENTERING) Turlough, you can rest on the bench.\nTURLOUGH: (EFFORT OF LYING DOWN) Thanks... I think I’m starting to feel my toes, at least.\nFARA: You’1l be fully recovered soon.\nNYSSA: (ENTERING) You’re right, Fara, there’s not much room.\nFARA: Drell doesn’t like it, do you, Drell? He likes flying in it even less.\nDRELL: Machines are not good. Not necessary.\nFARA: The Haragi distrust technology. And I sympathise, I choose\nFARA: nature over technology whenever I can, but when you have to get from one planet to another there’s no choice. And we’re here to help nature, after all. The nature of Alzarius.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 25\nMISTFALL: 14. MARSHLANDS\nSOLUS: If you came here by accident, as you say, how do you know so much about Alzarius?\nTEGAN: It’s a long story — Solus, did I catch that right?\nDOCTOR: Solus — you mentioned a Decider decree. Are you from the Starliner?\nSOLUS: The Starliner?\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) Yeah, what’s the Starliner?\nDOCTOR: (TO SOLUS) The Terradon Starliner. Your people were led by three Deciders.\nSOLUS: We still are. But the Starliner was a long time ago.\nDOCTOR: How long?\nSOLUS: I don’t know what to make of you two. For trespassers you’re not well informed.\nTEGAN: The Doctor asked you a question. How long?\nSOLUS: Get on board, up front with me. We can have the history lesson on the way.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 26\nMISTFALL: 15. FARA’S SHIP\nFARA: My people are descended from a community that lived ina Starliner that crashed on Alzarius thousands of years ago.\nNYSSA: I know something about that.\nFARA: You do? Then you know that the Starliner left Alzarius three hundred years ago?\nTURLOUGH: Don’t look at me. I know nothing.\nNYSSA: Three hundred years? I... Yes. Of course.\nFARA: The Starliner travelled for a long time after leaving, looking for somewhere suitable for a new home. Then they found a world. The Haragi’s world.\nDRELL: You came from the sky. The first outsiders my ancestors had seen.\nFARA: We made great friends of the Haragi. We established ourselves, we built and cultivated. We expanded and populated large areas over time. (BITTER) And of course we introduced technology on a grand scale, to a world that had known none of it.\nDRELL: Not our world any more.\nFARA: The Haragi were - are — a simple people, close to nature. We made it our world, we trampled over the natural beauty of that planet, and came to dominate it. Not through force, but through an absolute and arrogant assumption of our superiority through technology.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 27\nMISTFALL: 16. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER\nTEGAN: And this world became your new home?\nSOLUS: Those citizens, led by First Decider Login...\nDOCTOR: (A HAPPY MEMORY) Login! Such a good man...\nSOLUS: He saved us. Those first citizens, they worked hard. They built homes that over generations became vast settlements. They built industries that enriched our society. Within a hundred years we were trading with other worlds.\nDOCTOR: Does your world have a name?\nSOLUS: The Haragi had no name for it. So by Decider Decree it was named New Alzarius. (SEEING SOMETHING AHEAD) Oh for goodness’ sake!\nTEGAN: What is it?\nSOLUS: There was a temporary bridge over this ravine.\nTEGAN: Where’s it gone?\nSOLUS: They must have cut the supporting cables.\nTEGAN: Who?\nSOLUS: Outlers. We’ll have to find another way round.\nDOCTOR: Outlers. That’s another term from the past.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 28\nMISTFALL: 17. FARA’S SHIP\nFARA: They call us Outlers — it’s an old term, a pejorative for anyone who doesn’t conform, for anyone who chooses to live free of the whim of the Deciders.\nTURLOUGH: Deciders?\nFARA: Our leaders. There are three of them, a hangover from the time of the Starliner. Appointed at the discretion of the First Decider. We don’t do democracy.\nNYSSA: How many of you ‘Outlers’ are there?\nFARA: Here on Alzarius it’s just me and Drell, but we’re making life difficult for the expedition. Little things. We block the roads, steal their equipment, their food rations, that sort of thing.\nTURLOUGH: Why?\nDRELL: It frustrates them. Makes it difficult for them to move, to do their work.\nTURLOUGH: But why do it at all?\nDRELL: We want them to leave.\nFARA: We’re not going to let them trample over the beauty of this world as they have done on new Alzarius.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 29\nMISTFALL: 18. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER\nSOLUS: There you have it. Dead ahead. Alzarius base.\nTEGAN: Is that a spaceship?\nSOLUS: The central structure is the ship that brought us here. With living modules connected to the hull by sealed walkways.\nDOCTOR: And your Decider is here?\nSOLUS: Decider Merrion. The base is her command post.\nDOCTOR: This expedition must be very important to your people if you have a Decider to lead it.\nSOLUS: It’s our most vital endeavour. But enough, we’re arriving. And we have to get these Marshmen back into water as quickly as we can.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 30\nMISTFALL: 19. ALZARIUS BASE: MERRION’S QUARTERS\nMISTFALL: (FX: MODESTLY SIZED LIVING SPACE. DECIDER MERRION IS WORKING AT DESK, FINGERS BUSY ON A COMPUTER KEYBOARD. A COMMUNICATOR TRILLS, AND MERRION PRESSES A SWITCH TO TAKE THE CALL. )\nMERRION: Yes?\nARANA: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) Decider Merrion? Ma’am, Mr Solus’s compliments. He has returned.\nMERRION: Was he successful?\nARANA: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) He’s taking the Marsh creatures to the Science Unit.\nMERRION: Get them into the observation tank. Tell Mr Solus I’1l be there momentarily.\nARANA: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) Yes, Decider.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 31\nMISTFALL: 20. ALZARIUS BASE: TANK ROOM\nMISTFALL: (FX: A HIGH CEILINGED, METAL WALLED ROOM. OXYGENATED WATER\nBUBBLES: WITHIN A LARGE GLASS FRONTED TANK. A CRANE ARM IS AT WORK, LOWERING THE PODS INTO THE WATER. )\nSOLUS: Steady, I want those pods undamaged... Alright, they’re fully immersed. You can release them.\nSOLUS: (FX: THE CRANE STOPS. THE LINE ATTACHING IT TO THE PODS IS\nELECTRONICALLY: DETACHED AND SPLASHES INTO THE WATER. THE CRANE THEN WITHDRAWS. )\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) Now seal the tank.\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) Done. Safe and sound. Arana, what’s the water temperature?\nARANA: Twenty four degrees.\nSOLUS: Perfect.\nDOCTOR: What you’re doing here is very dangerous.\nTEGAN: Not to mention immoral.\nSOLUS: If I need your opinions I’1l ask for them.\nSOLUS: (FX: BEHIND THE ABOVE, THE MAIN DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND DECIDER\nMERRION: ENTERS. )\nMERRION: (ENTERING) That’s enough, Mr Solus.\nSOLUS: My apologies, Decider.\nDOCTOR: Decider Merrion?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 32\nMERRION: First Decider Lana Merrion. Who are you?\nTEGAN: I’m Tegan. This is the Doctor. You’re in charge of this lot, are you?\nMERRION: (RECOGNISING THE NAME) The Doctor?\nSOLUS: They say they came here by accident.\nMERRION: In a blue box perhaps?\nTEGAN: You know about the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Tegan...\nMERRION: Solus, these are friends of New Alzarius and are to be afforded every hospitality.\nSOLUS: But Decider, they’re trespassers.\nMERRION: Every hospitality.\nSOLUS: Yes ma’am.\nDOCTOR: Decider, I’m going to have to insist that you release these Marshmen.\nMERRION: That’s not going to happen. We’ve come a long way and taken a lot of risks to get them.\nTEGAN: You’ve no right to treat them this way!\nDOCTOR: Speaking of risks, if they wake up, are you sure this glass is strong enough to contain them?\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR GIVES THE GLASS TWO DEMONSTRATIVE STRIKES WITH THE SIDE OF HIS FIST.)\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) .. Because you had better be very sure.\nMERRION: They won’t wake up.\nTEGAN: How do you know?\nMERRION: Marshman hibernation is ended by a drop in temperature. Solus, what’s the water temperature at the moment?\nSOLUS: Twenty four degrees.\nMERRION: More than adequate. We’ll keep them nice and warm until we’re ready for them to revive.\nTEGAN: And then what? Vivisection?\nMERRION: (EMPHATICALLY) No.\nDOCTOR: Why take them at all?\nMERRION: Our mission is entirely ethical. Come next door and let me show you our Science Unit, where this work is co-ordinated.\nSOLUS: Decider, if you’ll excuse me, I have to write up my patrol report.\nMERRION: Certainly.\nSOLUS: Citizen Arana, stay with these ‘friends of Alzarius’, make sure they get anything they need.\nARANA: Yes, Mr Solus.\nMERRION: Doctor? Through here.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: Tegan?\nTEGAN: I’ll stay here and keep an eye on the Marshmen.\nDOCTOR: They’re not going anywhere.\nTEGAN: I don’t trust this bunch.\nDOCTOR: (RELENTING) I’11 be just next door.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR EXITS, THE DOOR SLIDES CLOSED. TEGAN WALKS UP TO THE GLASS. )\nARANA: What are you doing?\nTEGAN: Taking a closer look at the tank.\nARANA: Please. Don’t do that.\nTEGAN: Nervous?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 35\nMISTFALL: 21. ALZARIUS BASE: SCIENCE UNIT\nMISTFALL: (FX: A GENEROUS SIZED ROOM, EQUIPPED WITH SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS. THE TICK AND BEEP OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT WORK,\nOPERATED: BY CITIZEN SCIENTISTS. MERRION LEADS THE DOCTOR TO A BANK OF INSTRUMENTS. )\nMERRION: Our Science Unit. As you see, it’s well equipped.\nDOCTOR: I had a brief look when Solus brought us through to the tank room. I couldn’t help noticing this cage.\nMERRION: We do not intend to cause the Marshmen harm in any way.\nDOCTOR: Are you going to revive them?\nMERRION: Eventually, under very controlled conditions.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Decider. What is the purpose of your expedition?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 36\nMISTFALL: 22. ALZARIUS BASE: TANK ROOM\nMISTFALL: (FX: THE WATER BUBBLING IN THE TANK AS BEFORE. TEGAN WALKS\nSLOWLY: UP TO THE GLASS. )\nTEGAN: Strange to think there are living things in there... Hey. That’s odd.\nARANA: What?\nTEGAN: Should there be condensation on the tank?\nARANA: No...\nTEGAN: And the glass... it feels cold against my palm.\nTEGAN: (FX: THE CITIZEN CROSSES TO THE WALL CONTROL, TAPS THE CONTROL BUTTON. )\nARANA: The water temperature is still shown as twenty four degrees.\nTEGAN: It’s a lot colder than that.\nTEGAN: (FX: A LARGE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE WATER, CAUSING A SIZEABLE RIPPLE. )\nMARSH LEADER: (MUFFLED THROUGH THE GLASS AND FROM WITHIN THE POD, AN ANGRY\nWAKENING: GROWL)\nTEGAN: They’re moving!\nARANA: (NERVOUS) Do you think they’1ll come out of their pods?\nARANA: (FX: SUDDEN THRASHING IN THE WATER AS THE MARSHMEN — ONE A\nMARSH: LEADER - TWIST AND TURN WITHIN THEIR PODS.

Cripes, they’re big, aren’t they?\nARANA: Your friend said he wasn’t sure the glass is strong enough.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 37\nTEGAN: Let’s not take a chance. We need to get out of here.\nTEGAN: (FX: TEGAN RUNS TO THE DOOR, HITS THE DOOR CONTROL. THE DOOR\nREMAINS: SHUT. SHE HITS IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN.)\nTEGAN: (CONTINUED) The door won’t open!

What’s the other Marshman doing?\nTEGAN: Not much at the moment. Standing in front of me, deep breathing.\nDOCTOR: He’s acclimatising. He’s come from an underwater environment into one that’s oxygen-rich. Oxygen-rich.. Tegan, look around. Are there any oxygen cylinders in there?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 42\nMISTFALL: 27. ALZARIUS BASE: TANK ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nTEGAN: I don’t know... (GOING OVER) Wait, there’s a medical kit on the wall. — Yeah, there’s an oxygen cylinder inside!\nDOCTOR: (THROUGH DOOR) You can use the oxygen to hold off the Marshman when he revives. Spray it towards him. It’s too rich for him.\nTEGAN: Got it. Are you sure about this?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 43\nMISTFALL: 28.

Did they harm you?\nTEGAN: (SHAKEN) I’m okay. Doctor, I felt the glass of the tank just before the Marshmen woke up. The water was cold.\nTEGAN: (FX: SOLUS CROSSES TO THE WALL TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND TAPS IT.)\nSOLUS: The temperature gauge is still showing twenty four degrees.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 46\nMERRION: An instrument fault?\nDOCTOR: No. It was deliberate. The circuit junction had been tampered with. The door and heating controls.\nSOLUS: More Outler sabotage! That wretched kid Fara.\nMERRION: It’s a little sophisticated for him. And he would have needed to get into the base.\nSOLUS: I’ve said before, my security protocols are not being taken seriously. But this is the last straw. I’m going to take the transporter, I’m going to find him and drag him back here.\nMERRION: Don’t underestimate him.

You were going to tell me about the purpose of this expedition?\nMERRION: We are the fourth expedition to Alzarius, Doctor. Part of an undertaking to learn more about who we are, and our potential.\nDOCTOR: The Marshmen being your ancestors, of course.\nMERRION: We retain some traces of their super-evolutionary abilities. We recover quickly from minor injuries — that’s a Marshman trait. It may be we have other of their abilities latent within us.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 49\nTEGAN: Such as?\nMERRION: We know they have some form of telepathy. It may be that we could develop our own telepathic skills if we better understood how it manifests in the marsh creatures.\nDOCTOR: How do you propose to understand it better?\nMERRION: My aide is here. (CALLING) Come in, Fem.\nFEM: (ENTERING) You have a task for me, Decider?\nDOCTOR: Tegan! (TO FEM) I’m so sorry — Fem? Your appearance startled my friend.\nTEGAN: (REGAINING HER COMPOSURE) I apologise on my own behalf, thank you. (TO FEM) I’m very sorry... Are you...?\nFEM: Am I...?\nMERRION: Fem is not a marsh creature, Tegan. But she once was.\nFEM: (KINDLY) I am aware I look odd to your eyes. I am not offended. Please, say what you feel.\nTEGAN: You look... well, a bit like us. But still, there’s the...\nFEM: Bald pate? Prominent veins? Pale skin? Uncontrollable urge to kill?\nTEGAN: Um...\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 50\nFEM: My little joke.\nTEGAN: I knew that. (NERVOUS LAUGH)\nMERRION: Fem, could you take Tegan through to my sleeping quarters? Provide her with dry clothes from among my wardrobe.\nTEGAN: I’d appreciate that, thank you.\nFEM: Decider.\nFEM: (FX: TEGAN AND FEM APPROACH A FURTHER DOOR THAT SLIDES OPEN. THEY PASS THROUGH, IT CLOSES BEHIND THEM. )\nMERRION: Fem was collected as a Marshchild, in her pod, eight years ago — during the last expedition to Alzarius.\nDOCTOR: ‘Collected’? You mean kidnapped?\nMERRION: Doctor, please. I commanded that last expedition, I cared for Fem when she first arrived on New Alzarius, and I have taken her into my home. She’s like a member of my family. And she’s\nMERRION: happy.\nDOCTOR: She’s evolved so far in just eight years?\nMERRION: Remarkable, isn’t it? She’s still more Marshchild than New Alzarian, but nevertheless...\nDOCTOR: The speech patterns are flawless.\nMERRION: She’s remarkably intelligent, a quick study. We’ve learned a lot from her, but there’s much more to know. She will be crucial to this expedition, helping us communicate with the Marshmen.\nDOCTOR: Communicate? With the Marshman you captured?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 51\nMERRION: And with the others when they come out from the marsh.\nDOCTOR: When they...? You’re talking about Mistfall.\nMERRION: Of course.\nDOCTOR: (ALARMED) You’ve deliberately planned this expedition to coincide with Mistfall?\nMERRION: It’s the culmination of our mission.\nDOCTOR: It’s madness! This planet becomes entirely hostile during Mistfall. Not just the Marshmen, but — (STOPS HIMSELF) When\nDOCTOR: Mistfall due?\nMERRION: We cannot say precisely.\nDOCTOR: (ANGRILY) When??\nMERRION: is\nMERRION: Soon. A day, a week. Alzarius is entering the optimal orbital\nMERRION: position for Mistfall to occur.\nDOCTOR: Then it could happen any time. And I have two friends who are\nDOCTOR: still out there.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 52\nMISTFALL: 31. FARA’S SHIP\nTURLOUGH: Tell us, Fara, how did you and Drell meet up?\nFARA: Back home, I’m active in Haragi rights. Drell and I became friends following a natural disaster, a terrible flood, that killed many Haragi. Drell lost his family.\nNYSSA: I’m so sorry.\nDRELL: They are still with me, in my heart.\nTURLOUGH: You really think the two of you can stop this expedition?\nFARA: We’ll try. We have to.\nDRELL: They steal from this world. At first they took plants, and soil, and water.\nTURLOUGH: Sounds like standard scientific research.\nDRELL: And last time they took a creature. Removed it from its own kind and returned with it to New Alzarius. The creature has become a hybrid.\nNYSSA: That sounds horrible.\nFARA: We are determined to stop this. Before Alzarius is despoiled any further, its nature stolen and its people uprooted. We would be glad of your help, if you’re interested?\nDRELL: We need no others.\nFARA: But Drell, we could do so much more if it wasn’t just the two of us.\nNYSSA: We have a friend. His name is the Doctor. You should speak to him. If there’s injustice here, he’ll want to put it right.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 53\nTURLOUGH: (POINTEDLY) Not that this is any of our business. Nyssa.\nFARA: I would like to meet this Doctor.\nNYSSA: Come with us to our ship. He should be there by now.\nTURLOUGH: (SARCASTIC) Marvellous.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 54\nMISTFALL: 32. MERRION’S SLEEPING QUARTERS\nMISTFALL: (FX: SMALL LIVING SPACE. TEGAN IS FINISHING GETTING DRESSED,\nZIPPING: UP A TOP.)\nFEM: You look every part the citizen!\nTEGAN: Pretty basic gear, this.\nFEM: Expedition clothing is perfectly utilitarian.\nTEGAN: Apart from the lack of pockets.\nFEM: Let me fetch you a jacket from the Decider’s locker.\nFEM: (FX: FEM CROSSES TO THE LOCKER, OPENS IT, AND LIFTS OUT A JACKET, BEHIND: )\nFEM: (CONTINUED) Here, this should - (STOPS HERSELF) Eugh.\nTEGAN: What is it?\nFEM: There’s something on the jacket. Cobwebs.\nTEGAN: Cobwebs? As in what you get from.. ? (CATCHES HER BREATH) Fem. There’s something moving in the pocket.\nFEM: Moving?\nFEM: (FX: A LARGE SPIDER EMERGES CLICK-CLACKING FROM AMONG THE FOLDS OF THE JACKET. )\nTEGAN: Spider! Drop it! — Drop it!!!\nTEGAN: (FX: FEM DROPS THE JACKET ON THE FLOOR. THE SPIDER MOVES ALONG THE FLOOR, CLICK-CLACK. )\nTEGAN: That’s way bigger than any spider I ever saw back home.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 55\nTEGAN: (CONTINUED) Fem, get back!\nTEGAN: (FX: FEM HURRIES TO TEGAN’S SIDE. THE SPIDER SLOWS, TAKING\nDELIBERATE: STEPS.)\nFEM: It came at me!\nDOCTOR: (THROUGH THE DOOR) Tegan?! Are you alright?\nTEGAN: Doctor, come in, but be careful!\nMERRION: (ENTERING) Good grief! Where did that come from?!\nDOCTOR: Everyone, keep still. Don’t let it get near you!\nTEGAN: Doctor, it’s looking at me...\nDOCTOR: Tegan. When I say run...\nDOCTOR: Run! Don’t let it touch you!\nTEGAN: (DODGING ASIDE) Don’t worry!\nTEGAN: (FX: AFTER THAT ATTACK, THE SPIDER STOPS, STEADY CLICK-CLACKS AS IT TURNS ITSELF SLOWLY ON THE FLOOR. )\nTEGAN: It moves so fast!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps if I can throw my coat over it, we might be able to...\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 56\nMISTFALL: (FX: MERRION STEPS FROWARD AND BRINGS HER BOOT DOWN ON THE SPIDER, CRUSHING IT.)\nMERRION: Alternatively, I could crush it.\nTEGAN: Yeah. That worked.\nDOCTOR: There was no need for that.\nMERRION: We must agree to differ. Fem, where did it come from?\nFEM: The locker.\nDOCTOR: This one?\nDOCTOR: (FX: THEY CROSS TO THE LOCKER, THE DOCTOR OPENS THE DOOR WIDE. )\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) Cobwebs, I see. And... Oh. Of course.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR CROUCHES, LIFTS AN OBJECT FROM THE FLOOR OF THE LOCKER. )\nTEGAN: That looks like a rockmelon!\nDOCTOR: It’s a riverfruit. Or the remains of one. A staple food in these parts. Close to Mistfall, they sometimes host Marshspider eggs.\nTEGAN: How did it get in there?\nMERRION: It must have been placed here by the Outler. The boy Fara again! I’ll get security in here, make sure there are no more of these riverfruit. Fem, with me.\nFEM: Yes, Decider.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 57\nTEGAN: Why would someone leave that here? To kill Merrion?\nDOCTOR: It’s hardly a precise murder weapon. But more to the point, I don’t see how these Outlers could get into the base and into a Decider’s quarters without being spotted.\nTEGAN: You don’t think this Fara did it?\nDOCTOR: I think planting that riverfruit would have been a lot easier for someone already working on the base.\nTEGAN: An inside job?\nDOCTOR: Very likely.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 58\nMISTFALL: 33. FOREST TRACK\nDRELL: You said you landed near a waterfall. We know that place. It is not far.\nTURLOUGH: You know your way around.\nFARA: We've had to learn, to keep out of sight of the citizens.\nTURLOUGH: (SUDDEN) Hang on. Can you feel that?\nNYSSA: What is it?\nTURLOUGH: The ground is shaking.\nTURLOUGH: (FX: NEARBY, SMALL POCKETS OF GAS ARE VENTED FROM THE GROUND. MOISTURE IN THE GROUND BUBBLES OVER. CONTINUING BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nFARA: (DELIGHTED) Oh this is wonderful. This is how it always starts. Tremors underground, venting gases on the surface. The mists will follow shortly.\nDRELL: Mistfall is coming. The Marshmen will awaken.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 59\nMISTFALL: 34. ALZARIUS BASE: SCIENCE UNIT\nMISTFALL: (FX: THE DOCTOR, MERRION, TEGAN AND FEM ENTER, CROSS TO A TABLE. )\nMERRION: (APPROACHING) Put the spider remains on the bench, Fem. The science team can examine the carcass.\nFEM: Yes, Decider.\nFEM: (FX: FEM PLACES A METAL TRAY ON A TABLETOP. NEARBY, THE BARS OF THE CAGE ARE RATTLED ANGRILY. )\nTEGAN: The Marshman’s woken up, then.\nMERRION: He’s safe in that cage. It’s secured with a mechanical lock. No Outler sabotage will be able to set him free.\nDOCTOR: You said the Marshmen were intelligent beings. And yet you put him in a cage.\nMERRION: Be reasonable, Doctor. You saw how violent he was. They’re feral when they’re revived.\nMERRION: Fem. Are you alright?\nFEM: I felt a pain.. or maybe not a pain exactly... In my head.\nFEM: It’s him. The Marshman.\nFEM: (CONTINUED) Are you trying to communicate with me? Are you...\nFEM: Lhe)\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 60\nMARSH LEADER: (SUDDEN LOUD, ANGRY ROAR AS HE LASHES OUT AT FEM THROUGH THE\nBARS: )\nDOCTOR: Fem?\nFEM: I’m fine... Sorry, I didn’t mean to agitate him.\nDOCTOR: You felt the Marshman in your head?\nFEM: A definite contact of some kind. Not like speech, more like... concepts. Fear. Pain.\nFEM: (FX: AN ALARM SOUNDS FROM NEARBY INSTRUMENTS. MERRION CROSSES TO THE WORKSTATION, ACTIVATES A CONTROL. THE ALARM STOPS, AN\nELECTRONIC: READOUT BEEPS ACROSS A SCREEN. )\nTEGAN: What’s happening?\nMERRION: Our instruments are picking up low level seismic activity, in pockets, all across the planet.\nTEGAN: Seismic activity? Like an earthquake?\nDOCTOR: It’s not an earthquake, is it, Decider? It’s Mistfall.\nMERRION: Correct.\nFEM: This is the first sign of Mistfall, Tegan. Subterranean tremors.\nFEM: (FX: MERRION OPENS A COMMAND CHANNEL. AS SHE SPEAKS WE HEAR\nHER: VOICE REVERBERATE THROUGH SPEAKERS ACROSS THE BASE.)\nMERRION: This is Decider Merrion to all Alzarius Base personnel. We have Mistfall. Repeat, we have Mistfall. Begin lockdown procedures.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: Lockdown? Now wait a minute...\nMERRION: Remember your training — calm and measured. No panic. This is what we’re here for. Good luck everyone.\nTEGAN: Doctor, Turlough and Nyssa are out there!\nMERRION: This base will shortly go into secure lockdown. When it does it will be the only safe place on the planet.\nDOCTOR: Nonetheless, I need to locate my friends.\nDOCTOR: (FX: COMMUNICATIONS STATION COMES TO LIFE WITH A BURST OF STATIC, FOLLOWED BY: )\nSOLUS: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) Solus to Alzarius Base. Can you hear me? Over.\nMERRION: Solus?!\nMERRION: (CONTINUED) Solus, where are you?\nSOLUS: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) I’m looking for the Outler like I said.\nMERRION: You should return to base. Mistfall is beginning.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 62\nMISTFALL: 35. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER [CONTINUOUS]\nSOLUS: I know it’s Mistfall, I’m looking at it. How long until full lockdown?\nMERRION: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) An hour at the most.\nSOLUS: I’ll give it half an hour, then I’11 head in.\nMERRION: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) (RELUCTANTLY) Very well. — And Solus? There are others for you to look out for.\nSOLUS: Others?\nDOCTOR: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) Two friends of mine, Mr Solus — a young man and woman.\nTEGAN: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) They’re called Turlough and Nyssa.\nSOLUS: I’ll keep an eye out for them.\nMERRION: (COMMUNICATOR FILTER) We'll prepare drone coverage. If we see either the Outlers or the Doctor’s friends we’ll let you know.\nSOLUS: Understood. Solus out.\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) Your friends can look after themselves, Doctor.\nSOLUS: I’ve got other priorities.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 63\nMISTFALL: 36. ALZARIUS BASE: SCIENCE UNIT\nMERRION: There you are, Doctor. Solus will find your friends if they’re out there.\nTEGAN: In the mist? In half an hour?\nDOCTOR: What did you mean by ‘drone coverage’, Decider?\nMERRION: I’1l show you.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 64\nMISTFALL: 37. MARSHLANDS\nMISTFALL: (FX: FARA, DRELL, NYSSA AND TEGAN COME OUT FROM THE FOREST TO THE EDGE OF THE WATER. A BREEZE HAS PICKED UP, WHISPERING THROUGH THE TREES, STIRRING THE MARSH REEDS. )\nFARA: The mist is getting thicker.\nNYSSA: Yes. It seems to be thickest here by the marsh.\nTURLOUGH: Aren’t we supposed to be heading to the TARDIS?\nFARA: This is more important.\nDRELL: It is Mistfall!\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 65\nMISTFALL: 38. ALZARIUS BASE: SCIENCE UNIT\nMISTFALL: (FX: MERRION OPERATES A SERIES OF SWITCHES. AS SHE DOES,\nMULTIPLE: CORRESPONDING MONITORS COME TO LIFE.)\nMERRION: Part of our procedures for monitoring Mistfall include the deployment of aerial drones, equipped with infra-red imaging. They can detect movement even through thick mist. The images come up on these screens.\nTEGAN: Then they could be used to search for Nyssa and Turlough?\nMERRION: Marshmen have a distinctive body heat signature. Your friends will look very different. We’ll find them. And when we do, we'll send out a fast recovery squad to bring them back.\nMERRION: (FX: A SUDDEN LOUD, RESONANT VIBRATION FILLS THE ROOM.\nINSTRUMENT: PANELS COME ALIVE WITH WARNING ALARMS. )\nDOCTOR: What’s that?\nMERRION: I don’t know... Power outputs seem to be rising.\nDOCTOR: Let me see.\nDOCTOR: (FX: HE CROSSES TO AN INSTRUMENT PANEL, OPERATES CONTROLS, EXAMINES A READING. )\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) Your ship’s power core is surging.\nMERRION: Sabotage again!\nDOCTOR: Your central power control programming has been corrupted.\nDOCTOR: It’s not responding. The power core is going critical.\nMERRION: There must be a way to stop it.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 66\nTEGAN: The Marshman isn’t too happy.\nFEM: Please, I know you’re afraid. But calm down.\nTEGAN: Can he understand you?\nFEM: I don’t know. I feel his fear, I don’t know if he’s getting anything from me...\nFEM: (FX: THE POWER STUTTERS, SOME WORKSTATIONS ERUPT WITH SPARKING\nELECTRICAL: EXPLOSIONS. )\nMERRION: If we can’t stop this, the ship and this entire base will be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: Dim Erying.:\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR URGENTLY OPERATES CONTROLS AT THE WORKSTATION. )\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) The power surge has gone into an exponential loop.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR BUSILY OPERATES A KEYBOARD, ENTERING\nPROGRAMMING: INSTRUCTIONS. )\nTEGAN: That’s bad, right? (NO REPLY) Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Not now, Tegan. I’m busy!\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 67\nMISTFALL: 39. MARSHLANDS\nTURLOUGH: Fara, this is not a good idea. We should leave.\nFARA: I want to see them. The Marshmen.\nNYSSA: I know about the Marshmen. They’re dangerous.\nDRELL: It may be wise to withdraw.\nFARA: Drell?\nDRELL: To observe from a distance.\nFARA: Ha! Too late now.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, we have to leave!\nNYSSA: Fara, please! It’s not safe!\nFARA: They’re coming...\nMARSHMEN: (FX: THE MARSHMEN EMERGE EN MASSE FROM THE WATER. THEY START TOWARDS THE SHORE. )\nFARA: Aren’t they beautiful? Wonders of nature.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa!

What about the Marshman? You can’t leave him here.\nMERRION: If we release him he’1l attack us. There isn’t time to tranquilise and move him. He stays.\nFEM: But, Decider...\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 71\nMERRION: That’s my decision.\nMERRION: (FX: FEM PICKS UP A SET OF KEYS FROM A TABLETOP AND APPROACHES THE CAGE. )\nMERRION: (ANGRY) Fem! What are you doing?\nFEM: I’m going to unlock the cage.\nMERRION: No you are not.\nFEM: I’m sorry, Decider.\nMERRION: You’ve never challenged me before.\nDOCTOR: Fem is quite right. We can’t leave the Marshman to die.\nMERRION: You do not give orders here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: There’s no way now of stopping a critical power failure. We have to leave.

Use my tie as a sling. It’s all we can do for now.\nFARA: What? (CRIES OUT IN PAIN AS TURLOUGH PLACES HIS ARM IN THE SLING)\nTURLOUGH: Use your good arm for extra support.\nNYSSA: We need to get to the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: Yes, but can we even find the way in this mist?\nNYSSA: Well we can’t stay here.

No, we’ve.. tried to slow you down, stolen your equipment, that sort of thing, but nothing dangerous!\nSOLUS: (LAUGHS) I know you didn’t do it.\nFARA: Thank you...\nSOLUS: Because I did it.\nFARA: (THIS TAKES A MOMENT TO SINK IN) What.\nSOLUS: Drell. You can kill him now.\nDRELL: Yes.\nDRELL: (FX: DRELL APPROACHES FARA. DRAWS HIS SCABBARD. )\nDRELL: La SOW ‘Aid: 16?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nFARA: What?.. Drell, what are you [doing?]\nNYSSA: No! Stop!\nNYSSA: That was murder!\nSOLUS: Yes. It was.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, be careful...\nSOLUS: And now, what are we going to do with\nSOLUS: you two?\nSOLUS: Page 95\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 96\nMISTFALL: 56. FOREST: IN THE TREES\nMARSH LEADER: (MOANS WEAKLY. THEN STRONGER, ANGRY CRIES, STRUGGLING WITH\nWRIST: RESTRAINTS )\nDOCTOR: Steady now, steady. I’ve dressed your wounds but I’m sorry, your hands have to remain tied.\nTEGAN: I think it’s the tether round his neck he objects to most. Can’t say I blame him, either.\nMERRION: (APPROACHING) We’re keeping this Marshman on a leash, injured or not. Doctor, we’ve been here far too long.\nDOCTOR: He’s injured. Can you run up a rudimentary stretcher? Perhaps from the [branches and foliage]\nTEGAN: No need, he’s getting up!\nMERRION: The creature is clearly not as debilitated as its injuries suggest.\nDOCTOR: He’s healing, quickly.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 97\nMISTFALL: 57. FOREST CLEARING\nNYSSA: Why did you do it, Drell? Why did you kill Fara?\nTURLOUGH: Well, answer her!\nDRELL: Fara came here to die.\nSOLUS: Or rather, he was brought here to die. All this has been a long time in the planning.\nTURLOUGH: What has?\nDRELL: Our revenge.\nTURLOUGH: Revenge? For what?\nSOLUS: We should move from here. You two, in the transporter. Do I have to tell you what will happen if you try to escape?\nNYSSA: No.\nSOLUS: Good. Get in.\nSOLUS: (FX: NYSSA AND TURLOUGH OPEN A SIDE DOOR IN THE TRANSPORTER\nAND CLIMB IN. CONTINUES INTO: )\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 98\nMISTFALL: 58. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER [CONTINUOUS]\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) Whatever he says, first chance we get — we escape. He’s a madman.\nNYSSA: (QUIET) Agreed. Do you think he was right, about the Doctor being in that explosion?\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) We should hope for the best. But we also have to\nTURLOUGH: assume we’re on our own now.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 99\nMISTFALL: 59. FOREST CLEARING. [CONTINUOUS]\nSOLUS: (CALLING OFF) Enough talking, you two!\nDRELL: Solus. Is it done?\nSOLUS: She survived.\nDRELL: How?\nSOLUS: The power surge didn’t reach critical as quickly as we'd hoped. I’ve been tracking her bio-implant. She and other survivors are in the forest, on the move. They’1ll be lucky to survive for long.\nDRELL: We must be sure. She must die.\nSOLUS: Oh we’ll make sure, don’t worry... Say, what have you got there?\nDRELL: Those two, they have a.. ship. But not a ship. A place of science. This was in it.\nSOLUS: What a curious thing. Let me see.\nSOLUS: (FX: SOLUS TAKES THE CRYSTAL FROM DRELL, TURNS IT OVER, CAUSING THE TONE TO SHIFT.)\nSOLUS: (CONTINUOUS) It’s a component of some kind. You can see the connector. Possibly a power source.\nDRELL: It is important to them.\nSOLUS: Well then, that makes it important to me. Mind if I keep it?\nDRELL: I do not want their crystal if it is a part of their science.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 100\nSOLUS: I’1l want a look at this ship of theirs in due course. For now, let’s get away from here.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 101\nMISTFALL: 60. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER [CONTINUOUS]\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Turlough — did you see? That man Solus took the interface stabiliser!\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) Quiet, they’re coming over.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) We have to get it back!\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 102\nMISTFALL: 61. FOOTHILLS.\nMISTFALL: (FX: MISTFALL AMBIENCE. DOCTOR, TEGAN, MERRION, FEM AND THE\nMARSH: LEADER MOVE OUT OF THE FOREST INTO MORE OPEN, ROCKY GROUND. )\nTEGAN: The ground is starting to rise. We must be in the foothills.\nMERRION: It shouldn’t take long to reach the caves.\nTEGAN: He’s pretty chipper for someone who had trouble staying on his\nTEGAN: feet an hour ago.\nDOCTOR: Marshmen have remarkable powers of recovery.\nFEM: I can feel that his pain is easing.\nTEGAN: Say.. what’s that light over there? That blue light. See?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nTEGAN: It’s coming from that pool. A blue glow!\nTEGAN: (FX: THE GROUP STOPS BY THE POOL. THE DOCTOR CROUCHES DOWN BY IT, SCOOPS A HANDFUL, BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nDOCTOR: It’s like the water itself is energised.\nMERRION: Spiders!\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 103\nMISTFALL: (FX: THE DOCTOR STANDS UP SMARTLY AND BACKS AWAY. THE SPIDERS\nCLUSTER: AROUND THE POOL AND DIP THEIR PROBOSCISES IN THE WATER. )\nDOCTOR: Calm down, everyone. They’re not interested in us. They appear\nDOCTOR: to have come for the water.\nTEGAN: They’re drinking it?\nDOCTOR: It looks that way.\nMERRION: We should move on while they’re distracted.\nDOCTOR: Good idea.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) (MOVING AWAY) It’s curious behaviour, though.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 104\nMISTFALL: 62. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER\nSOLUS: Right. Let’s check the tracker.\nSOLUS: (FX: SOLUS ACTIVATES CONTROLS. A SUBTLE, REGULAR PING COMES FROM THE INSTRUMENTS. )\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) There she is. About two miles away, her and her group are in the foothills.\nDRELL: Those lights. That is them?\nSOLUS: The transporter can track all expedition bio-implants. Including hers.\nNYSSA: Who are you talking about?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, all this has nothing to do with us.\nDRELL: (TO NYSSA) The woman we have come here to kill.\nSOLUS: Decider Lana Merrion.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 105\nMISTFALL: 63. HILLSIDE: CAVE ENTRANCE\nMISTFALL: (FX: MISTFALL AMBIENCE. DOCTOR, TEGAN, FEM, MERRION, THE MARSH LEADER AND THEIR GROUP APPROACH THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE CAVE. )\nTEGAN: That is one spooky looking cave.\nMERRION: It will give us shelter.\nDOCTOR: Everyone, inside.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 106\nMISTFALL: 64. SOLUS’S TRANSPORTER\nNYSSA: Who is this ‘Lana Merrion’ ?\nSOLUS: A Decider. One of the three.\nNYSSA: Why would you want to kill her?\nSOLUS: Because of Decider Decree eighteen thirty-one.\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nDRELL: The death sentence for hundreds of the Haragi people.\nSOLUS: Two years ago, back home, there was a natural disaster.\nTURLOUGH: Fara mentioned a flood, I remember...\nSOLUS: Earthquakes in the Northern Zone caused a tidal wave that threatened to wipe out one of our major cities.\nDRELL: Decider Merrion invoked Decider Decree eighteen thirty-one. It was an emergency decree, which meant the votes of the other two Deciders were not needed. The decision was hers alone.\nTURLOUGH: What was this decree?\nSOLUS: It meant blocking the estuary north of our city, to divert the tidal wave.\nTURLOUGH: Did it work?\nDRELL: Oh yes. It worked.\nNYSSA: So, the city was saved?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 107\nSOLUS: The tidal wave was diverted towards Haragi lands. Most received no warning, and were in their homes when the wall of water swept through.\nDRELL: I lost my mother and father, and my brother. I survived because I was in the city, selling food.\nNYSSA: That’s terrible.\nSOLUS: My younger sister, Lareena, had married an Haragi. Many citizens like the simplicity of Haragi life. She had been married less than a year.\nNYSSA: She died?\nSOLUS: Oh yes. She died. By order of Decider Lana Merrion. The city contained thousands of citizens. She acted to protect them in favour of the Haragi.\nDRELL: (SNEERING) She is a hero to her people for what she did that day.\nSOLUS: But we are her justice. She will pay. Lana Merrion will not see another dawn.\nNYSSA: I still don’t see why you needed to murder Fara.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t you?\nSOLUS: Merrion sent several messages back to New Alzarius with details of the sabotage conducted by the Outler Fara. He will be the obvious and only suspect. And, conveniently, dead.\nTURLOUGH: And you?\nSOLUS: I will be the only survivor. I’ll escape in the boy’s ship and will be a further witness against him.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 108\nTURLOUGH: And what about Drell?\nSOLUS: There are rumours of an Haragi working with Fara, but that’s all they are. He’1ll leave with me on the ship, stowed away.\nNYSSA: But what if Merrion and the others survive?\nDRELL: There will be no survivors. No witnesses. We will make sure of that.\nSOLUS: And I’m afraid you two come under the heading of ‘witnesses’.\nSOLUS: So you have to die too.\nTURLOUGH: Now wait a minute...\nSOLUS: Stay back. This gun doesn’t stun, it’1ll put a hole in you.\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) Good lad. Now, both of you — outside.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nMISTFALL: 65. TUNNEL JUNCTION\nMISTFALL: (FX: TUNNEL AMBIENCE, A TALL REST OF THE GROUP COME ALONG\nHARD: SURFACE. )\nMERRION: Two tunnels. Which way?\nFEM: Does it matter?\nDOCTOR: It might matter\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR\nFAINT: SCUTTLING\nDOCTOR: Page 109\nDOCTOR: CAVERN. DOCTOR, TEGAN AND THE THE TUNNEL, WALKING ON A DANK\nDOCTOR: a great deal. Let me see...\nENTERS: ONE OF THE TUNNEL OPENINGS AND STOPS. SOUNDS FROM INSIDE THAT TUNNEL. )\nENTERS: (CONTINUED) (FROM THE SMALLER ACOUSTIC OF THE SIDE TUNNEL) No.\nENTERS: Not in here.\nTEGAN: Why not that tunnel?\nDOCTOR: It’s full of cobwebs.\nTEGAN: Spiders! Oh great.\nDOCTOR: I think moving. But this way.\nTEGAN: You don’t hear me arguing.\nTEGAN: they’ve made their home in\nTEGAN: there. We should keep\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 110\nMISTFALL: 66.RIVERSIDE\nMISTFALL: (FX: MISTFALL AMBIENCE. WATER LAPS AT THE RIVER’S EDGE. SOLUS, DRELL, NYSSA AND TURLOUGH APPROACH AND STOP. )\nSOLUS: Here we are. Just what I was after. Know what those are?\nTURLOUGH: Fruit of some kind?\nSOLUS: They’re called riverfruit. As you might expect from the name, you often find them growing in large quantities like this near water.\nTURLOUGH: We’re having a picnic?\nSOLUS: I’m afraid not.\nTURLOUGH: Asked more in hope than expectation.\nNYSSA: What are you going to do with us?\nSOLUS: You're in for a surprise.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 111\nMISTFALL: 67. CAVE TUNNEL\nDOCTOR: Ah. A choice of tunnels now. Wait here while I scout ahead down the left fork.\nMERRION: I’11l come with you, Doctor.\nTEGAN: Me too.\nTEGAN: (FX: THE DOCTOR, TEGAN AND MERRION WALK OFF DOWN THE TUNNEL FORK. THE CITIZENS SETTLE THEMSELVES. )\nFEM: You can sit down.\nFEM: I’ll sit too, if that’s alright?\nFEM: (CONTINUED) (NERVOUSLY) Do you understand me? .. I don’t want you to be afraid.\nFEM: (GASPS) I feel you inside my head! (WINCES) Too much! Wait, I need to concentrate, to make sense of what you’re — Oh... You are a leader?\nFEM: Your thoughts, your words are very clear to me now. Much more than before.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 112\nFEM: My speaking? I am not sure how I learned. Except by listening to them and making the sounds.\nFEM: I wish you could talk. It would be much easier.\nFEM: What are you doing?\nCITIZENS: (CONCERNED HUBBUB) “What’s he doing?”.. “Is it safe?”.. etc.\nMARSH LEADER: (FX: THE MARSH LEADER WALKS OFF DOWN THE TUNNEL, FEM FOLLOWING BEHIND. )\nFEM: (MOVING AWAY) Wait, you can’t go down there until the others come back! (CONCENTRATES, RECEIVING THE MARSH LEADER’S THOUGHTS) There is something in this tunnel? Something ‘wonderful’? .. What does that mean? What’s down there?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 113\nMISTFALL: 68. TUNNEL BRANCH\nDOCTOR: There’s something up ahead. A light.\nTEGAN: Shimmering. And it’s that same bright blue.\nMERRION: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Some kind of natural illumination perhaps. Its source is\nDOCTOR: further down the tunnel. Let’s take a closer look...\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nMISTFALL: 69. RIVERSIDE\nMISTFALL: Page 114\nMISTFALL: (FX: DRELL IS FINISHING STAKING DOWN NYSSA AND TURLOUGH, HAMMERING A SHORT LENGTH OF WOOD INTO THE GROUND WITH A\nMISTFALL: STONE. )\nDRELL: It is done.\nSOLUS: There we are. All nice and secure. Completely helpless.\nTURLOUGH: (TESTING THE STRENGTH OF HIS RESTRAINTS) What’s the big idea,\nTURLOUGH: staking us to the ground?\nNYSSA: I have a horrible idea I know.\nSOLUS: I’1ll show you. (CROUCHES DOWN) riverfruits have detached from ripe.\nNYSSA: (AFRAID) Please, don’t.\nSOLUS: The young lady appears to know\nTURLOUGH: What do you mean?\nSOLUS: Have a listen. hear.\nSOLUS: If I put one to\nSOLUS: Did you notice how these their vines? That means they’re\nSOLUS: her riverfruit.\nSOLUS: your ear you should be able to\nSOLUS: (FX: SOLUS PICKS UP A RIVERFRUIT AND WALKS OVER TO TURLOUGH,\nCROUCHES: DOWN. CLOSE ON MIC, SCRATCHING FROM INSIDE THE\nCROUCHES: RIVERFRUIT. )\nTURLOUGH: Scratching? Is there something\nDRELL: Spiders.\nTURLOUGH: Spiders?!\nSOLUS: Poisonous apparently. Possibly\nSOLUS: alive in there?\nSOLUS: Carnivorous.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 115\nMISTFALL: (FX: SOLUS AND DRELL PICK UP SEVERAL RIVERFRUIT AND DROP THEM ON THE GROUND AROUND NYSSA AND TURLOUGH. )\nSOLUS: (CONTINUED) There you are. Ten or so should do.\nTURLOUGH: (TERRIFIED) You don’t need to do this.\nSOLUS: (LEAVING) When they find your bodies, it will be assumed you were two unfortunate visitors who fell victim to Mistfall.\nTURLOUGH: Tied up?!?\nNYSSA: Solus! Come back! — Come back, Solus!\nTURLOUGH: (STRAINS AT HIS RESTRAINTS) Ah, Drell tied these too well, they won’t budge.\nNYSSA: (ALSO STRAINING) Keep trying, Turlough. Those spiders could break out at any time.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 116\nMISTFALL: 70. POOL CAVERN\nMISTFALL: (FX: A VAST CAVERN, AT THE CENTRE OF WHICH IS A LARGE POOL. THE WATER IS SWIRLING AND BUBBLING, ENERGISED. DOCTOR, TEGAN AND MERRION ENTER. )\nMERRION: My word...\nDOCTOR: That is quite spectacular.\nTEGAN: It’s like the pool we saw outside. Only much larger.\nDOCTOR: Bright blue and effervescent.\nTEGAN: Is it just me, or is there something in the water...?\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Swirling around. Points of bright blue, coalescing and detaching. It’s quite hypnotic...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE MARSH LEADER STRIDES IN AND HALTS. BEHIND HIM, FEM AND THE CITIZENS. )\nDOCTOR: Well hello there. You look well. Lost your dressings I see.\nMERRION: Fem, what is he doing here?\nFEM: We followed him. We couldn’t stop him.

Why?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 117\nMARSH LEADER: (STRAINS TO FORM WORDS. THE GUTTURAL STUTTERS AS BEFORE. THEN - ) I. Can. Tell you.\nMERRION: He can speak!\nDOCTOR: A newly acquired skill. He’s a very fast learner, this one.\nFEM: In my head, he told me he is a leader among the Marshmen.\nMERRION: Stay back! Citizens! Hold him!\nMARSH LEADER: NO! (LASHES OUT)\nMARSH LEADER: (STILL LEARNING TO SPEAK) You. Will not. Hurt me. And I. Will not. Be.

Use your language.\nDOCTOR: Fem?\nFEM: (TURNING CONCEPTS INTO A LUCID DESCRIPTION) The blue elements in the water are energised minerals, expelled by the crust of Alzarius. They infuse the water with life-enhancing properties. The water in turn permeates the soil and the vegetation. The waters are ingested by the Marshmen and by all the creatures of Alzarius. Life on Alzarius is linked, through the properties of this mineral.\nTEGAN: That’s incredible.\nDOCTOR: A fully integrated eco-system.

Look closer — the rock around the edge is melted.\nMERRION: What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: I’1l tell you what I think it means.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FLASHBACK, BEHIND THE DOCTOR’S WORDS.

The ship had suffered a critical systems failure, and was falling towards the surface of Alzarius.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FLASHBACK. A SECTION OF THE STARLINER DETACHES, IN FLAMES, AND FALLS AWAY. )\nDOCTOR: (V/O) Imagine, a damaged engine power cell. It becomes super- heated. Possibly the Starliner crew eject it, possibly it detaches, but it falls towards the surface. The Starliner crashes in the valley...\nDOCTOR: (FX: FLASHBACK.

Then all your fates will be decided.\nDOCTOR: Leader, you should speak with Fem. She’s spent years with these people, lived among them.\nTEGAN: They’re not evil. They think a lot of you.

If only there was another - (SUDDEN IDEA) Wait a minute.

There has to be a way through from the Pool of Life, the blue water we saw outside proves tt.\nTEGAN: You hope.\nFEM: He has returned!\nDOCTOR: Turlough. — What did you find?\nTURLOUGH: (TREADING WATER, RECOVERING) There is an opening, a channel of some sort, down there. Wide enough to swim through. Who knows where it leads?\nDOCTOR: There’s one way to find out. If you feel up to it.\nTEGAN: You’re being volunteered, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I meant, a Marshman!\nTEGAN: They’ve got gills.\nTURLOUGH: So?\nTEGAN: We don’t. The Alzarians don’t.\nDOCTOR: Tegan’s right, we need to know if there’s any way through for non-Marsh dwellers.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 146\nTURLOUGH: (RESIGNED) Better than staying here I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Good man.\nMARSH LEADER: Some of my people will go with you.\nFEM: And me.

CAVE.\nDRELL: You murdered my people! You murdered my family!\nMERRION: That’s not how it was!\nSOLUS: Tell that to my dead sister, Decider.\nMERRION: I regret those deaths, of course I do. But more than fifty thousand people — Citizens and Haragi — would have died if the tidal wave had not been redirected.\nSOLUS: Into the valley. Eight hundred people. Their blood on your hands.\nMERRION: We mobilised as fast as we could to evacuate the settlements.\nMERRION: Where we — where I — miscalculated was how difficult it would\nMERRION: be to communicate the evacuation warning to the Haragi. It was a tragedy.\nSOLUS: So you tried to protect yourself, to keep the Decree secret. But people will talk...!\nMERRION: It was decided that the people did not need to know, for the sake of both our communities.\nDRELL: By you and the other Deciders!\nMERRION: By the Haragi High Council.\nDRELL: What?\nMERRION: I met with the Haragi leaders as soon as I could after the tragedy. I explained what I had done and why. I offered myself up to Haragi justice, for them to try me and sentence me as they wished.\nDRELL: You are lying.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 155\nMERRION: The Haragi Council declined. They understood the reasons for my decision, even if they didn’t agree with it. Then they proposed that the facts should be withheld from the public record.\nSOLUS: Why?\nMERRION: Because it was done and could not be undone. And because there would be many who would not understand, through their grieving.\nDRELL: A deception. Sanctioned even by my own people.\nMERRION: Refusing to divert the flood would have resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands. Doing nothing would have been as positive an act of killing as making the decision to block that estuary.\nSOLUS: Enough talking. You’ve made your final decision, Decider!\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING IN FROM OFF) No. Like I said to the Decider earlier — let’s talk our way out of this.\nSOLUS: Doctor! — Oh, and his friends, too.\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING DOCTOR IN) We heard everything, Solus.\nNYSSA: Please, stop this before it’s too late.\nSOLUS: It was too late long ago!\nDOCTOR: Solus. You were responsible for blowing up the base, of course? And sabotaging the water tank? Waking the Marshmen?\nMERRION: For the spider in my locker?\nTEGAN: Yeah, that nearly killed me.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR: I realised those acts of sabotage had to be the work of someone on the inside. When all this is investigated, others will realise the same.\nSOLUS: All they’1l know will be the reports they’ve already received about Outler sabotage, and that the base was destroyed.\nDOCTOR: Was it always your intention to kill everyone in the expedition?\nSOLUS: Of course.\nTEGAN: To cover your tracks?\nSOLUS: The Decider’s death alone would make her a martyr. The loss of her expedition and almost everyone on it would make her the leader of a mission that ended in a catastrophic failure. She would die with ignominy.\nDRELL: With these deaths, her people will feel pain such as the Haragi have endured.\nNYSSA: You really think you can get away with it?\nSOLUS: I’m getting away in Fara’s ship. The rescue party will find me drifting a few light years from here.\nNYSSA: What about Drell?\nSOLUS: He will also be on Fara’s ship.\nNYSSA: But if the rescuers see him, won’t that give the game away? He’s not part of the expedition.\nDRELL: There is a storage compartment in the craft. I will be concealed there.\nDOCTOR: Is that what he told you?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 157\nNYSSA: It’s hardly practical.\nSOLUS: Shut up.\nDOCTOR: That ship belongs to the man you’1l say murdered all those people. When it’s picked up it will be examined for evidence. Every inch of it.\nTEGAN: You need to think that through, Drell. Does that really sound realistic? Solus won’t be taking you anywhere.\nDRELL: Solus...?\nSOLUS: Don’t listen to them.\nDRELL: (ANGRY) You said I would be safe. Did you intend to leave me here?\nSOLUS: After a fashion.\nSOLUS: (FX: SOLUS FIRES GUN, HITTING DRELL — WHO COLLAPSES ON THE GROUND, DROPPING HIS BLADE. )\nTEGAN: You maniac, you’ve killed him! — What did you do that for?!\nSOLUS: Your Doctor’s right, he’d have been a liability.

I’m so sorry —\nDOCTOR: (TO SOLUS) What about the citizens in the tunnels? They’1ll get out eventually. They’1ll be working with the Marshmen to free themselves.\nSOLUS: How enterprising of them. Won’t help, though.\nTEGAN: Why not?\nSOLUS: There are plenty more explosive charges in this bag. Enough to seal off every exit in these tunnels permanently. Now...\nSOLUS: It’s time for you to die.\nMERRION: Do it, then. Do it, Solus!\nSOLUS: I’m not going to kill you first, Decider. I’m going to make you watch as I kill all these others.\nMERRION: But they’re innocent!\nSOLUS: Exactly.

IT LAUNCHES FROM THE FOREST AND TEARS AWAY UPWARDS INTO THE HEAVENS. )\nFEM: What’s that noise?\nMERRION: To the east. A spacecraft!\nTURLOUGH: I see it. That’s Fara’s spacecraft. You don’t suppose...?\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) I don’t see who else it could have been, do you?\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 169\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nNYSSA: That’s how Solus was planning to make his escape. In Fara’s\nNYSSA: ship.\nTEGAN: Are you telling me Solus survived?\nTURLOUGH: It rather looks that way.\nTEGAN: What, and now he’s skedaddled? With this interface stabiliser?\nDOCTOR: Into the TARDIS, all of you. — All of you, quickly! (FX: AS\nCOMPANIONS: ENTER) In, in! — Goodbye again, Lana, Fem.\nMERRION: Goodbye, [Doctor]\nDOCTOR: So sorry, no time.\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 170\nMISTFALL: 101. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Now, let’s see if I can get a fix on Solus...\nNYSSA: Doctor, Fara’s ship used ion-based engine technology, I believe.\nDOCTOR: So he’1ll be leaving an ion trail. We can track that.\nTEGAN: Yeah, but can the TARDIS actually fly without this stabiliser doo-dah?\nDOCTOR: Theoretically.\nTURLOUGH: Is it dangerous?\nDOCTOR: All I know is, we couldn’t possibly survive a trip back through a CVE without it. So if we don’t get it back, we’re trapped in E-Space. Forever.\nNYSSA: Doctor, if we don’t get out of E-Space, I’1l never see Neeka or Adric again.\nDOCTOR: I’m aware of that, Nyssa. — Brace yourselves, everyone.\nTURLOUGH: Why? What’s going to happen if you try to take off without this stabiliser?\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure.\nTURLOUGH: Marvellous.\nTEGAN: Just do it if you’re doing it, Doc!\nMISTFALL: by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 171 (FX: DOCTOR OPERATES CONTROLS. DEMATERIALISATION NOISE BEGING... )\nDOCTOR: There. That doesn’t sound too t-[errible]\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS LURCHES, ENGINES STRAINING. SYSTEM ALARMS SOUND,\nELECTRICAL: EXPLOSIONS SPARK ON THE CONSOLE. )\nTEGAN: /TURLOUGH/NYSSA:\nTURLOUGH: What’s happening?\nTEGAN: Doctor, do something!!\nDOCTOR: We’re out of control!! Nothing’s responding!! I don’t know what to do!\nEND: TITLES"
