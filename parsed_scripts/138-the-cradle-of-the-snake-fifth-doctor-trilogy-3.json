TARDIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TEGAN’S ROOM\nDOCTOR: Tegan? Come on, you can’t stay in there all night. (BEAT) Tegan?\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: She’s locked herself in her room.\nNYSSA: It’s my room too.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I know that, thank you, Nyssa.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Tegan. We want to help.\nNYSSA: She’s scared. It was a shock.\nDOCTOR: Completely understandable, but shutting herself away won’t help. Tegan?\nNYSSA: I’m sure she’ll open the door when she’s ready.\nDOCTOR: That’s hardly the point. Suppose she’s lost consciousness.\nNYSSA: Could it be that bad?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, just tell us that you’re alright.\nTURLOUGH: What’s happening?\nNYSSA: Not now, Turlough. Tegan’s not feeling well.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 3\nTURLOUGH: She’s ill? It’s not contagious, is it?\nNYSSA: It’s not a virus if that’s what you mean. Well, not in the\nNYSSA: normal sense.\nTURLOUGH: So you do know what it is?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, if the Mara really is still with you, then we can do something about it. I’1ll get some help.\nTURLOUGH: The Mara? What’s that?\nNYSSA: Not now. I’1l explain later.\nTURLOUGH: That would be nice.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, just one word... please.\nTURLOUGH: You might have to kick the door down.\nDOCTOR: Not if I can help it.\nNYSSA: Let me try.\nDOCTOR: Be my guest.\nNYSSA: And it might be better if you were to... erm (leave. )\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) Come on, Turlough. (QUIETLY) We won’t be far.\nNYSSA: I’ll be fine, really.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 4\nTURLOUGH: Why? Is Tegan dangerous?\nDOCTOR: Come on, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: (MOVING AWAY) I was only thinking of Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Tegan, it’s me. The others have gone now. (BEAT) Look, I know it’s difficult, but we’re all worried about you. You can talk to me. You know you can. (BEAT) I was there before remember. On Manussa. I know what you’re going through. So please, just say something.\nNYSSA: (FX: AFTER A BEAT, A CHAIR IS PULLED AWAY FROM THE INSIDE. THE\nLOCK: CLICKS. THE DOOR OPENS)\nLOCK: Tegan, thank goodness.\nTEGAN: You can’t even begin to know.\nTEGAN: 2. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: We'll just stay here for a while.\nTURLOUGH: Where’s here?\nDOCTOR: Nowhere really. I’ve put the TARDIS in a holding pattern. Better not to go anywhere for the moment.\nTURLOUGH: You're quarantining us. Because of Tegan’s illness.\nDOCTOR: It’s not an “illness.” Not as such.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 5\nTURLOUGH: Well, what is it then? Nyssa called it “the Mara?” Is that right?\nDOCTOR: The Mara, yes. But I’m not really sure how I'd define it. I think perhaps it’s in all of us, deep in our minds. In our darkest thoughts, that’s where it started. Some people call it a demon, but that’s too simple. It’s about temptation. You remember temptation, Turlough. The Devil always finds work for idle hands?\nTURLOUGH: I put that behind me.\nDOCTOR: Good. Because the Mara’s always looking for a way to be born; to be more than just a nasty thought. It wants to break into our reality. And it delights in mocking order and causing chaos.\nDOCTOR: Now what have I done with that thing?\nTURLOUGH: But what about Tegan? How’s she involved?\nDOCTOR: Tegan was vulnerable. Not really through her own fault. But the Mara found a way through her troubled dreams into the world.\nDOCTOR: No, not here either. Where have I put it? I’d hoped we’d dealt with the Mara once... but then it came back. And now it’s back again.\nTURLOUGH: How many times?\nDOCTOR: This is the third appearance. And each time it seems to coil itself tighter.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 6\nDOCTOR WHO: 3. TARDIS. TEGAN’S ROOM\nTEGAN: I suppose I’ve been in denial all this time. Hoping it wasn’t there, you know? Well, I should have known better. I did know. I knew it was there.\nNYSSA: Suppose we try and get you help? There are facilities on Terminus... if we could get you there.\nTEGAN: I’d give the psychiatrists nervous breakdowns.\nNYSSA: Then talk to the Doctor. He’s bound to have ideas.\nTEGAN: What’s the point?\nNYSSA: Tegan...\nTEGAN: Even now you’re looking at me and thinking is that her or the Mara talking.\nNYSSA: I know it’s you.\nTEGAN: Do you? I’ve been having dreams again too.\nNYSSA: I know. You’ve been sleeping badly.\nTEGAN: Sorry to keep you awake. I suppose you told the Doctor?\nNYSSA: No.\nTEGAN: Really? There was a time when you’d have been running straight to him. Or our good friend Turlough, now he’s on the straight and narrow.\nNYSSA: He’s concerned. We all are.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 7\nTEGAN: (VOICE DARKENING) You’re all so nice and wholesome... and boring.\nNYSSA: Tegan...\nTEGAN: Always so considerate. What a waste. There are better things to do with the Universe.\nNYSSA: (GETTING NERVOUS) I think I should fetch the Doctor... so he knows you’re alright.\nTEGAN: Don’t go yet.\nNYSSA: Please open the door.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, you’re always helping other people when you could be helping yourself. Wouldn’t that be better?\nNYSSA: That’s not what I believe in. Please let me out.\nTEGAN: But there’s so much more. Think about it.\nNYSSA: You’re not Tegan.\nTEGAN: At last. Well done. You got the direct line to Maraland.\nNYSSA: I’m not interested.\nTEGAN: Stick with me and you can start to enjoy yourself. Look. Here. See what’s under my sleeve.\nNYSSA: (SCARED) The sign of the snake.\nTEGAN: Isn’t that what you want? (LAUGHS) Of course it is. Don’t resist, Nyssa.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nNYSSA: Leave me alone.\nTEGAN: Take it!\nNYSSA: No!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Keep away from her!\nTEGAN: You! Interfering...!\nDOCTOR: Remember this, Tegan? The little mind’s eye from Manussa.\nDOCTOR: Look at the crystal! Try to focus your thoughts.\nTEGAN: It’s just a toy.\nDOCTOR: Hardly that.\nTEGAN: It takes two to play the game, Doctor. Come and find me!\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING HER) It’s alright. I’ve got her.\nNYSSA: She fainted.\nDOCTOR: Did she? (TEGAN’S HEAVY) Where’s Turlough?\nDOCTOR: Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 9\nTURLOUGH: Here, Doctor. Nyssa? Are you alright?\nNYSSA: I’1ll be fine.\nDOCTOR: Help me with Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Right.\nDOCTOR: Lay her down. That’s it. Nyssa?\nNYSSA: How’s her pulse?\nDOCTOR: Slow.\nTURLOUGH: Her voice was all wrong. Like someone else’s. Not Tegan at all.\nNYSSA: We could use the sleep induction box again. That would blot out her dreams.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s too late for that.\nTURLOUGH: And there’s a snake mark on her arm. Is that the Mara?\nDOCTOR: Later, Turlough.\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You heard what she said.\nNYSSA: The game, yes.\nDOCTOR: It was a challenge. The Mara’s withdrawn into Tegan’s psyche. And it wants me to go in after it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: 4. TEGAN’S ROOM\nDOCTOR: No. No, move my chair a bit closer.\nTURLOUGH: Got it. But I still think this is a bad idea.\nNYSSA: The Doctor has to do this now. We can’t land the TARDIS. If the Mara got loose on some unsuspecting planet, just think what havoc it would cause.\nTURLOUGH: But going into Tegan’s mind? Rather you than me.\nDOCTOR: All right, both of you, while I’m asleep...\nNYSSA: You want us to stay with you.\nDOCTOR: Please sit quietly and don’t do anything to wake me. That’s important. I’1ll do that myself.\nNYSSA: And suppose Tegan wakes up first?\nTURLOUGH: Just hope it is Tegan.\nDOCTOR: I won’t let that happen.\nNYSSA: It’s still very risky.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is. Right. Wish me luck. (BEAT) So... I focus my thoughts through the crystal.\nDOCTOR: (DEEP BREATH) Deeper... deeper... until... I find.. the still point.\nNYSSA: (QUIETLY) He’s gone. So quickly.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa? Look at Tegan. She’s smiling.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: 5. TEGAN’S MINDSPACE — CABIN OF A CESSNA LIGHT AIRCRAFT IN\nTEGAN: You nearly missed the flight, Doctor. But then time was never your strong point, was it?\nDOCTOR: Is this Tegan’s plane?\nTEGAN: Her Dad's.\nDOCTOR: Single engine Cessna Skyhawk. I suppose five thousand feet is as good a place to talk as any.\nTEGAN: It’s one of her fondest memories. Flying with him over the farm. A couple of thousand Merinos to look out for.\nDOCTOR: It’s her memory, not yours.\nTEGAN: Oh, we’re pretty close, Tegan and me. Hard to prise us apart.\nDOCTOR: I doubt she has any say in the matter. You’ve been in her mind long enough. It’s time you went back where you came from.\nTEGAN: Whoops! Sorry about that. We seem to be hitting a bit of turbulence.\nDOCTOR: I want you to leave Tegan now.\nTEGAN: You’1l have to focus your thoughts better. You can’t just throw the Mara out. It doesn’t work like that. I have to go somewhere.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 12\nDOCTOR: I can think of a few places. Just go!\nTEGAN: (OVER ENGINE NOISE) Remember where you are, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Tegan, can you hear me? Try to fight the Mara!\nTEGAN: Oh, please!\nDOCTOR: I’1l drive you out. Before you destroy Tegan’s mind completely!\nTEGAN: Make me a better offer!\nDOCTOR: You don’t belong here!\nTEGAN: Neither do you! Go and talk to the other sheep!\nTEGAN: (FX: DOOR CLUNKS OPEN. THE DOCTOR YELLS INTO THE DISTANCE, FALLING. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: 6. TEGAN’S MINDSPACE — HILLSIDE\nDOCTOR: (BEAT. SHEEP BLEATING. TWO SHEEP CALLED NYSSA AND TURLOUGH,\nBOTH: CHEWING GRASS, STAND AND LOOK AT HIM. PRODUCER'S NOTE: IT'LL BE UP TO THE DIRECTOR AND THE ACTORS TO DECIDE HOW MUCH OF A SHEEP VOCAL DELIVERY IS REQUITED! )\nTURLOUGH: It’s that look again.\nNYSSA: Indignant. Mortally offended.\nTURLOUGH: Ba-a-a-a-ad news. Always knew he was heading for a fall.\nNYSSA: Do you think he’s losing his faculties?\nTURLOUGH: Has been for years. Good thing he landed face down.\nNYSSA: If he’d fallen on his back, he’d never be able to stand up again.\nTURLOUGH: The trouble is, he’s always focussed on the top of the hill...\nNYSSA: And never notices the be-e-e-e-est grass under his feet.\nDOCTOR: What are you two sheep staring at? (SITS UP) Oh... typical. That’s my best coat.\nNYSSA: & TURLOUGH (REPEATING INTO THE DISTANCE Mu-u-u-u-ud! Mu-u-u-u-ud!\nTEGAN: (APPROACHING) Any thoughts, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Parked your plane, I see. No, no thoughts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 14\nTEGAN: Then I’1l make you an offer. Tegan is yours if I find a new home.\nDOCTOR: Meaning what exactly?\nTEGAN: Now where shall I go?\nTEGAN: Hmm. Difficult to choose. Which do you think?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. You leave Nyssa and Turloug alone.\nTEGAN: You’re right, of course. Who needs all that bleating? When I could go for something a bit more up market... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I want you out of Tegan's mind. Leave her alone.\nTEGAN: Remember this? The Mark of the Snake?\nDOCTOR: Keep away from me. I can resist you!\nTEGAN: Can you, Doctor? Really?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. I can resist you. I can drive you out!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: 7. TARDIS. TEGAN’S BEDROOM\nTURLOUGH: What sort of dream is he having?\nNYSSA: I don’t like this, Turlough. I think we should wake him.\nTURLOUGH: He told us not to.\nNYSSA: He’s feverish. Suppose he’s in trouble.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan doesn’t seem worried. She’s still well out of it.\nNYSSA: I can’t just sit here.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTER) Tegan! Stay away! No!\nNYSSA: Right. That’s it. I'm waking him. I’1ll take the blame.\nTURLOUGH: Careful.\nNYSSA: (GENTLY) Doctor? Come on, Doctor. Please wake up. Please.\nDOCTOR: (WAKING) Leave Tegan alone! (BEAT) Ah... Nyssa...\nNYSSA: Doctor, I’m sorry. I had to wake you.\nTURLOUGH: We were both worried. You were yelling as if you were fighting something.\nDOCTOR: I told you not to wake me!\nNYSSA: Is the Mara still there? In Tegan’s mind?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 16\nDOCTOR: It was. I was drawing it out into the open. Loosening its grip. But now..? Who knows?\nNYSSA: I’m really sorry.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you ever listen?\nTURLOUGH: We’re both sorry.\nDOCTOR: So you should be. Look at the crystal.\nNYSSA: The Little Mind’s Eye. It’s broken. How did that happen?\nDOCTOR: Probably when the Mara attacked me. When I tried to drive it out.\nNYSSA: Maybe you succeeded. It might have gone.\nDOCTOR: Gone where?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan’s still asleep. But she’s getting some colour back.\nNYSSA: That’s a good sign.\nTEGAN: (CHEERFULLY SLEEPY) Hullo... What are you all doing here?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, hello. How did you sleep?\nTEGAN: Like a log, thanks. It was nice.\nTURLOUGH: Any dreams?\nNYSSA: Turlough...\nTURLOUGH: Only asking.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 17\nTEGAN: Yes, I was dreaming. I was at the beach eating ice cream. Chocolate and strawberry, like when I was little. You know when it melts faster than you can eat it.\nDOCTOR: Pleasant dreams then. That’s good.\nTEGAN: What happened to your crystal? It’s broken.\nDOCTOR: Bit of an accident, that’s all. Not to worry. Could I just... look at your arm?\nTEGAN: Oh.. The Mara. I forgot. How could I forget that? Did you do something?\nDOCTOR: I sincerely hope so. There’s no mark on your arm.\nTEGAN: There hasn't been for ages actually. Not since last time.\nNYSSA: I think you’re much better.\nDOCTOR: Do you feel better?\nTEGAN: Dunno. Maybe. Yes, I suppose I do feel better.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. Come on then, you two. I’m sure Tegan wants to freshen up.\nTURLOUGH: And I could do with some breakfast.\nNYSSA: Me too.\nTEGAN: See you later.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: 8. TARDIS CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: (QUIETLY) You’re not sure, are you?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. What I really need, after tea and a slice of toast, is a second opinion.\nNYSSA: Launching Tegan out into an unsuspecting world? Suppose the Mara is still in her?\nDOCTOR: Well, what can I do? We can’t stay circling in nowhere for ever. Sorry, Nyssa. I have to take the risk.\nDOCTOR: 9. DREAM CHANNEL ADVERT\nRICK: Bored with the same old routine? Had all your hopes dashed?\nRICK: And your dreams gone flat?\nRICK: But now the latest technological advances can change all that. Suddenly nothing need be out of reach again.\nRICK: I believe we’re on the edge of a revolution in therapy and entertainment. And tomorrow night that dream comes true.\nRICK: I’m Rick ausGarten. Join me tomorrow at eight for Dreamarama, live on the Sundown Channel, when I’1l prove that we are such things as dreams are made of.\nRICK: And you’ll never be the same again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: 10. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: Dojjen. Remember him? The old archaeologist on Manussa who went native and joined the snakedancers.\nTURLOUGH: Snakedancers?\nNYSSA: Is that where we are? Manussa again?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I thought we might pop in and see him. Just to catch up. I have so many friends I only ever meet once.\nTEGAN: This is for my benefit, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I did hope he might give you a quick check up.\nTEGAN: I knew it was too good to last. It’s still there, isn’t it? That “thing?” In my head?\nDOCTOR: Now Tegan...\nTURLOUGH: Is that it? Manussa? It’s more advanced than I thought.\nNYSSA: Is it? That doesn’t look right.\nTEGAN: Typical! He winds me up and then brings me to the wrong place.\nDOCTOR: No. Definitely Manussa. I set the co-ordinates myself.\nTEGAN: Well, look at it. They didn’t have high rise buildings like that.\nNYSSA: No, the Doctor’s right. It is Manussa...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 20\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nNYSSA: .but the date’s wrong.\nDOCTOR: Let me see.\nTEGAN: If that is Manussa, it’s hundreds of years later.\nNYSSA: Actually, it’s much earlier.\nTURLOUGH: Earlier?\nDOCTOR: Alright. Which of you touched the controls?\nTURLOUGH: Well, don’t look at me.\nTEGAN: Certainly not.\nNYSSA: Nor me.\nDOCTOR: Well, whoever’s responsible, they’ve landed us centuries before I planned. And the planet is far more advanced. This is the Manussan Empire, long before its subjugation and decline under the terrible yoke of the Mara.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: 11. RICK AUSGARTEN’S WAREHOUSE\nBAALA: (FEEDING A BIRD) Come on, beaky. Take it. That’s it...\nRICK: (APPROACHING) Baala!\nBAALA: Over here, Mr ausG.\nRICK: Get a move on, Baala. It’s ten to noon already. She’ll be here any minute.\nBAALA: But I’ve still to feed the birds and animals. It upsets them if their routine goes wrong.\nRICK: And keep this warehouse locked. The Safety Officer, Mrs... “Rayluss”, is only checking the studio. Not out here. One glimpse of the livestock and she’1ll shut us down anyway. I thought we’d give her a run through of tomorrow’s show.\nBAALA: You know the old man’s back.\nRICK: What?\nBAALA: Dadda Desaka.\nRICK: Not again. I thought you got rid of him.\nBAALA: He’s sitting out the front, protesting. He’s even got a placard. He says we’re committing blasphemy. All our work and the show.\nRICK: This is your fault, Baala. If you hadn’t given him food... He’s not another pet; he’s a damn nuisance.\nBAALA: The Dadda’s a mystic.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 22\nRICK: He’s a grubby old tramp who wandered down from the hills. I’m getting him moved on.\nBAALA: You can’t. He’s a native Manussan holy man. He’s protected by law.\nRICK: Tell you what: we’1ll invite him on the show and see what his holy thoughts look like. If that doesn’t grab the ratings, nothing will.\nBAALA: I don’t think he’1ll consent to that.\nRICK: Ah, not already. That’1ll be the Officer. You close this place up. I’ll honey her round the studio. By the time we’re done, it’ll have the cleanest safety bill ever.\nRICK: (FX: CHILDREN PLAYING. PASSERS-BY. IT’S A SUNNY AND HAPPY PLACE. )\nTEGAN: It’s really not so bad here.\nNYSSA: You almost sound convinced.\nTEGAN: Well, I figured that since I know I didn’t change the coordinates, then it’s not my problem. So I’m going to enjoy myself. It’s a long time since I sat in a park and did nothing.\nTURLOUGH: It wasn’t me that altered the coordinates either.\nNYSSA: I don’t think it was any of us. Just the Doctor making a slip. It’s easily done.\nTURLOUGH: Where is he anyway?\nNYSSA: He went to make some enquiries.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 23\nTEGAN: Mm, this is more like it. Palm trees, fountains. I could sit here all day and soak up the sun. If I had money, I’d buy us all ice creams.\nTURLOUGH: I’m going for a stroll.\nNYSSA: Don’t go too far.\nTURLOUGH: (MOVING OFF) I won’t.\nNYSSA: Turlough’s nervous. He won’t sit still.\nTEGAN: He’s always nervous. And with good cause this time.\nNYSSA: Tegan, you don’t mean it was him.\nTEGAN: Why not? If the Mara has left me...\nNYSSA: Tegan...\nTEGAN: Which it has. Then surely Turlough’s the obvious place for it to go. He must have interfered.\nNYSSA: I wouldn’t say that without proof. I’m nervous too. What does that tell you?\nDOCTOR: (ARRIVING) It’s very pleasant here. Just the spot for a rest.\nNYSSA: Hello. Did you find what you wanted?\nDOCTOR: I did indeed. Whatever Manussa’s future’s like, it’s certainly a thriving and enlightened world just now. And tomorrow is New Year. Fancy that. I expect there’1l be parties.\nNYSSA: That’1ll be good.\nDOCTOR: Where’s Turlough?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 24\nTEGAN: Mooching about somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Right. Well, the information office was very helpful. They’ve put me in touch with an eminent neuroscientist. Doctor Honri Kerrem at the Faculty of Advancement. And he’s agreed to give you a thorough check up, Tegan.\nNYSSA: That’s a wonderful idea.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Tegan?\nTEGAN: Okay. Fine.\nDOCTOR: You’re not even going to argue?\nTEGAN: Not if it proves to you what I already know.\nDOCTOR: Good, good. It’s just across town, so we’ll need to take a tuk- tuk. Nyssa, you and Turlough can wait here. We’1ll only be a couple of hours.\nNYSSA: All right. Good luck, Tegan. I’1l go and tell Turlough now.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s taken Tegan to see a specialist.\nTURLOUGH: I saw them go. I hope he gets danger money.\nNYSSA: Look, are you all right? You’ve gone very edgy.\nTURLOUGH: You think I’m “infected”, don’t you? But I’m not. Really I’m not.. You know that, don’t you?\nNYSSA: I don’t know, Turlough. You tell me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 25\nDOCTOR: This is certainly the way to see the city. Everyone living their lives on the street, like an endless market.\nTEGAN: Is this going to be okay, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I think so. Doctor Kerrem assured me that he has the most advanced techniques in neural probes and crystal scanning. And I’ll be there with you. It’ll be fine.\nTEGAN: I think I’d rather have a private consultation.\nDOCTOR: If you like, but I won’t be far away. I promise.\nTEGAN: I do appreciate it, you know. Even if I do come over like all spiky and moaning.\nDOCTOR: You, Tegan? Surely not. You’ve had a horrible time. Let’s get this cleared once and for all.\nDOCTOR: (FX: A TALKING BILLBOARD WITH THE VOICE OF RICK PASSES THEM.\nTINNY: MUSIC)\nRICK: (DISTORT) Have all your dreams gone flat? Well, I aim to make them all come true.\nTEGAN: What is that?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of advert.\nRICK: (DISTORT) I’m Rick ausGarten. Join me tomorrow at eight, New Year’s Eve, for Dreamarama, live on the Sundown Channel. Look into the crystal. Your dreams will never be the same again.\nTEGAN: (SCARED) My dreams? Doctor, promise me that’s not where we’re going.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 26\nYOANNA: RAYLUSS FINISHES HER SAFETY AUDIT.\nYOANNA: Well, the studio seems to be in order, Mr ausGarten. Once you’ve attended to the door in the isolation chamber, that is.\nRICK: Right. Well erm, thanks, Mrs Rayluss. You’ve been very helpful. I’1l show you out.\nYOANNA: My real concern is the subjects, the members of public taking part in the experiment. They should undergo a full health check beforehand.\nRICK: Yeah, well, that’s not so easy. Coz it’s live, there’s the element of surprise. Anyone can get chosen.\nYOANNA: I do see that as a problem. “Matter realisation?” Is that what you call it?\nRICK: Pure thought goes into the crystal and comes out as living matter. It’s easy. No ill effects.\nYOANNA: I know it’s an illusion, like a rabbit out of a hat.\nRICK: No, no. Don’t mock it. Our process is scientifically proven. We've done over eight hundred test runs. It’s amazing and fun. It’s bringing science to the people.\nYOANNA: Not to everyone, it seems. I thought that alarming old tribesman outside was going to throw something. He swore you were cursed and you’d bring all sorts of horrors down on the CLlys\nRICK: All publicity is good publicity.\nYOANNA: And a lot of people believe that stuff. We don’t want a disaster. Not on live transmission.\nRICK: Tell you what. Why don’t you have a go?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 27\nYOANNA: I don’t think so.\nRICK: Why not? What better proof than if you’ve done it yourself? Come on. Can I call you Yoanna? Think of something you’d like.\nYOANNA: Well, I confess I am intrigued.\nRICK: Right then. It’s already on standby. So sit yourself in the Chair of Dreams...\nYOANNA: The Chair of Dreams? Oh, well. I suppose...\nRICK: Lovely. Now we’1ll run a quick scan into the old electric crystal to map out your brain potential. And then let’s see what you can think into existence.\nRICK: 15. DR KERREM’S CONSULTANCY\nKERREM: Now Tegan, are you comfortable?\nTEGAN: I guess so.\nKERREM: The skullcap not too tight?\nTEGAN: Fine. Thanks, Dr Kerrem.\nKERREM: Good. Now the blue crystal here in the neuro-imagevr...\nTEGAN: It’s like the Mind’s Eye.\nKERREM: I’m sorry?\nTEGAN: The Doctor... he had something like it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 28\nKERREM: Your companion?\nTEGAN: Yes.\nKERREM: He seemed a knowledgeable fellow. Well read for one so young.\nTEGAN: He is. I mean, he’s not as young as you think, but don’t tell him I said that.\nKERREM: Right. So the crystal will scan your brain in multi-modal detail. In particular, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus: what we think of as the “aware areas.” It’1ll highlight any abnormalities or disturbances — any extra activity that might be causing you to dream.\nTEGAN: Okay.\nKERREM: Right. You may feel a slight tingling, a little like itching on the inside, but that’s nothing to worry about. So, ready, Tegan?\nTEGAN: Ready.\nTEGAN: 16. RICK’S STUDIO YOANNA IN THE CHAIR.\nBAALA: Dreammaker now scanning.\nRICK: Just relax, Yoanna. This only takes a few moments.\nBAALA: Scan complete. Thoughts are now compatible.\nRICK: Thanks, Baala. Okay. You remember what you wanted to visualise?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 29\nYOANNA: I do.\nRICK: Don’t tell us. Just think of it now. In detail. And don’t change your mind halfway through.\nYOANNA: I’m thinking.\nRICK: Good.\nBAALA: Image forming in isolation chamber.\nRICK: Here it comes. It’s a flower. Yes?\nYOANNA: Erm... well...\nBAALA: Consolidating.\nRICK: A giant flower. A rose. Ah, that’s very nice. Lovely. Good image.\nYOANNA: That’s not what I was thinking.\nRICK: Not a rose?\nYOANNA: There’s something there. In the flower. Look! Something squirming. Ugh... what’s that? It’s horrible!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: 17. THE DOCTOR’S HEAD/KERREM’S WAITING ROOM\nDOCTOR: It’s a rose... and there’s something growing in it. (ENJOYING THIS) Struggling through the petals to be born. (HE STARTS TO\nLAUGH: )\nKERREM: Doctor?\nKERREM: THE DOCTOR GASPS.\nDOCTOR: Dr Kerrem?\nKERREM: Are you all right, old chap?\nDOCTOR: Yes, fine. Miles away. Sorry, must be sitting in a draught.\nKERREM: Well, I’m delighted to say that the scan’s complete. So if you'd like to come through, Tegan’s waiting.\nDOCTOR: (DARKLY) Good. I look forward to that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: 18. RICK’S STUDIO\nYOANNA: (FRIGHTENED) Did you see it?\nRICK: I’m not sure.\nYOANNA: Something was moving in the petals. Writhing. Like a snake.\nYOANNA: And then there was a man, a tall man with fair hair... and he was\nYOANNA: watching in the shadows in the heart of the rose.\nRICK: Baala, check the isolation chamber.\nBAALA: Okay.\nYOANNA: He was watching us from the dark.\nDADDA: IS SUDDENLY THERE. SHAKING HIS MARACAS AT HER. INTONING A WORDLESS DIRGE.\nDADDA: (NB: Dadda Desaka’s “wordless” dirges. There is a full version at the back\nDADDA: of the script.)\nRICK: Hey, you! How did you get in?\nBAALA: Don’t touch him!\nYOANNA: Get him away from me!\nRICK: Get him out!\nBAALA: Dadda Desaka!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 32\nDADDA: Wickedness! Badness!\nBAALA: Come on, Dadda. Outside now.\nDADDA: Wickedness is born. It comes into the world.\nRICK: Get out! Out!\nDADDA: All be dead. (RESUMES SINGING)\nBAALA: (LEADING HIM OUT) Come on. Out here. Nothing you can do.\nRICK: Yoanna.. Mrs Rayluss, I am so sorry.\nYOANNA: I’m leaving.\nRICK: No, don’t go. It was just an accident. Oh, look, you’re shaking. I’1l1 get you a drink.\nYOANNA: It’s very clear, Mr ausGarten, that your project is highly dangerous. All this is going in my report.\nRICK: It’s never happened before. I don’t understand.\nYOANNA: I’m recommending closure of your project pending a further full investigation. Good afternoon.\nRICK: (YELLS IN FURY) Deadheaded bureaucratic pen-pushers! Now what\nRICK: do I now?! Baala? What do we do now!\nBAALA: The rose is dead. Look. All withered away.\nRICK: (DEFEATED) She wasn’t even thinking of a rose.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: 19. KERREM’S CONSULTANCY\nDOCTOR: (DELIGHTED) Tegan! How are you feeling?\nTEGAN: A whole lot better thanks.\nDOCTOR: Excellent!\nKERREM: There’s some miniscule damage to the tissue of the hippocampus, but nothing even remotely to worry about. I’1ll prescribe you something to help you sleep, but overall you’re in fine fettle.\nDOCTOR: So it’s an ‘all clear’.\nTEGAN: Certainly is. Thank you Dr... Doctors.\nDOCTOR: If you want to get some fresh air, I'll erm.. settle up with Doctor Kerrem.\nTEGAN: (MUTTER) You have money?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we can come to an agreement.\nTEGAN: Okay. See you in a minute.\nKERREM: Spirited young lady. Pleasure to deal with her.\nDOCTOR: Yes, indeed.\nKERREM: So, I’1ll just run you off an invoice. You can make out a credit to the Faculty.\nDOCTOR: Ye-es. Erm, Dr Kerrem?\nKERREM: Yes, Doctor... after all that I still didn’t catch your name.\nDOCTOR: I did wonder, since I’m here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nKERREM: Something else I can offer?\nDOCTOR: A word in private...\nKERREM: Hmm?\nDOCTOR: (GROWING SURLY) ..about an affliction of my own.\nKERREM: (ANNOYED) What are you doing? Leave that alone.\nDOCTOR: I’ll be needing funds, you see. And contacts.\nKERREM: You’ve changed your tune.\nDOCTOR: Page 34\nDOCTOR: For the better, I should say. My affliction is newly acquired.\nDOCTOR: Newly born.\nKERREM: What sort of affliction?\nDOCTOR: Have you seen this before?\nKERREM: (HORRIFIED) All up your arm. Nasty looking snake thing. What\nKERREM: does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It’s the Mark of the Mara.\nKERREM: The what?\nDOCTOR: It’s alive and growing.\nCRIES: OUT IN PAIN\nDOCTOR: And soon, with your help, all of Manussa shall know its name!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART 1.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: PART 2.\nDOCTOR WHO: 19. KERREM’S CONSULTANCY (REPRISE)\nDOCTOR: Have you seen this before?\nKERREM: All up your arm. Nasty looking snake thing. What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It’s the Mark of the Mara.\nKERREM: The what?\nDOCTOR: It’s alive and growing.\nCRIES: OUT IN PAIN\nDOCTOR: And soon, with your help, all of Manussa shall know its name!\nTURLOUGH: (EDGY) How long did the Doctor say he’d be? (BEAT) Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (WAKING) Mm? Oh, sorry. I must have nodded off. It’s so peaceful here.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor... when did he say he’d be back?\nNYSSA: What’s the time? Oh... Definitely not as long as this.\nTURLOUGH: He’s probably got lost. You know what he’s like.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ALL ACTIVITY STOPS. BIRDS STOP SINGING. CHILDREN STOP PLAYING)\nNYSSA: I suppose we just... (wait.) (BEAT) Something’s happening.\nTURLOUGH: Not happening, you mean. (SHIVER) It’s gone chilly.\nNYSSA: Like the world catching its breath.\nTURLOUGH: Or choking. What are we waiting for?\nTURLOUGH: (FX: IDENTICAL AMBIENCE STARTS AGAIN. IDENTICAL CHILDREN PLAYING. TIME REPEATS — SORT OF)\nNYSSA: (RELIEF) Oh, that’s better. Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Mm? Sorry, I nearly nodded off. It’s so peaceful here.\nNYSSA: I’m sure the Doctor should be back by now.\nTURLOUGH: Probably got lost. You know what he and Tegan are like.\nNYSSA: I suppose we just wait.\nTURLOUGH: Over there.\nNYSSA: Mm? Oh. Some sort of beggar?\nTURLOUGH: He’s a hunter. Look how he moves.\nNYSSA: When we were here before...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nTURLOUGH: In the future?\nNYSSA: Yes. They talked about tribesmen, up in the hills. Snakedancers.\nTURLOUGH: Look out. Here he comes.\nNYSSA: No. Sorry, we don’t have anything to give.\nTURLOUGH: He’s probably got more than we have. Don’t look at me that.\nNYSSA: Sorry. We don’t understand you.\nDADDA: (GROWL) You understand too much.\nNYSSA: What do you mean? No, don’t go. Come back!\nTURLOUGH: I don’t like it here. Something’s changed.\nNYSSA: Where’s the Doctor? Why doesn’t he come back?\nNYSSA: Page 37\nNYSSA: like\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: 21. KERREM’S CONSULTANCY\nDOCTOR: (SNEER. THE MARA BRINGS OUT THE DARK SIDE OF THE DOCTOR. REVELLING IN EVIL CHARM AND SMOOTHNESS )\nDOCTOR: Sit down, Dr Kerrem. It takes a few moments to settle in.\nKERREM: (HIS DARK SIDE ALSO SUDDENLY TO THE FORE) No, no. (AMUSED) It’s quite... quite invigorating. The Mara. Oh, yes. I think I shall enjoy this.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you will, believe me. Tell me about the world. How advanced is Manussa’s mind crystal technology?\nKERREM: You saw for yourself. Medical practice is revolutionised.\nDOCTOR: Only medical? What about a man called Rick ausGarten? The man on the billboards.\nKERREM: Huh! That quack! He’s a maverick.\nDOCTOR: But he works with crystals too?\nKERREM: He’s more showman than scientist.\nDOCTOR: Jealous, Dr Kerrem? Is Rick a disgrace to his profession? Or just popular?\nKERREM: Bah.\nDOCTOR: I think he’s ideal for our purpose.\nKERREM: All this nonsense about thought materialisation. He’s certainly got himself a following.\nDOCTOR: Has he indeed? Right, I want a list of the influential minds on Manussa. Not the idiot politicians, but the intellectuals. The thinkers.\nKERREM: Anyone in particular?\nDOCTOR: You have the contacts, Kerrem. Enjoy yourself. Settle your debts. I want them brought together. I have a task for them.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 39\nKERREM: Anything else?\nDOCTOR: Money.\nKERREM: Cash, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Come on, cough up. I’ve got work to do.\nKERREM: (SIGH) Here’s five thousand in notes.\nDOCTOR: And the rest. And that phone of yours while we’re at it. I’1l need to stay in touch.\nKERREM: That’s my private link.\nDOCTOR: (TESTY) Good. Then I can call you on your public line.\nTEGAN: Doctor? The tuk-tuk’s still waiting.\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY HIS OLD SELF) Tegan. Sorry to keep you.\nTEGAN: The others’1l be worrying.\nDOCTOR: Yes, indeed. We must be going. Well, goodbye Dr Kerrem. Thanks again for your help.\nKERREM: A pleasure, “Doctor.”\nTEGAN: Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: (CONFIDENTIAL, TO KERREM) I’11 give you a call.. later.\nKERREM: Peshy? Put me through to the Director of the Faculty.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 40\nNYSSA: It’s getting dark. Suppose we head back to the TARDIS?\nTURLOUGH: We can’t get in.\nNYSSA: I know, but the Doctor will follow us.\nTURLOUGH: Fine.\nNYSSA: You still haven’t relaxed.\nTURLOUGH: It’s this place. Everyone’s too nice. It makes me uncomfortable.\nNYSSA: I liked it at first, but it does get a bit much. The goodness on my own world, on Traken, was robust in comparison.\nTURLOUGH: You were brought up being reasonable.\nNYSSA: Yes, I was. But here, the locals are trying almost too hard.\nTURLOUGH: As if they’re hiding something. I wonder what.\nNYSSA: Or is it just that we know what’s coming?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t. (SIGH) And now I suppose you’re going to tell me. Go on then.\nNYSSA: Sorry, Turlough. But all this world, the heart of the Manussan Empire, gets swept away under the rule of the Mara.\nTURLOUGH: That snake thing on Tegan’s arm?\nNYSSA: Hopefully not any more. The Mara created... will create its own Sumaran Empire.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 41\nTURLOUGH: I wish I hadn’t asked.\nNYSSA: But surely an Empire implies order. I never understood that. How can an Empire exist under the Mara? It’s a spirit of mockery and chaos and evil. Anyway that doesn’t happen yet. We've arrived years too early.\nYOANNA: (SHORT WAY OFF. DISTRAUGHT) No, no, no. That’s not what I asked for!\nTURLOUGH: Oh, hello. Now what’s happening?\nYOANNA: I don’t want these charms. They’re no good to me. I told you.\nNYSSA: Something’s upset her.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t get involved.\nYOANNA: (CALLING) Excuse me. Please.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry, we can’t help.\nYOANNA: (APPROACHING) Please. I’m trying to explain to this man and he doesn’t understand.\nNYSSA: We don’t really live round here, you see.\nYOANNA: Well, neither does he. That’s the problem. I simply want a charm to ward off snakes.\nTURLOUGH: Snakes! Are there snakes round here?\nYOANNA: Oh God, are there? Round here too? It’s bad enough having one in your head.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 42\nTEGAN: (VERY HAPPY) The city really buzzes at night. Maybe we should go out to celebrate.\nDOCTOR: Why not. I’m really glad, you know, Tegan, that you’re better.\nTEGAN: Me too.\nDOCTOR: And the others will be pleased. Nyssa was really worried.\nTEGAN: I know she was.\nDOCTOR: She was scared you had too weak a constitution to pull through.\nTEGAN: She said what?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she meant well. She underestimates humans. You know what the upper classes are like.\nTEGAN: I can’t believe she said that. Not even Turlough would say that.. not now. But Nyssa? She’s my friend.\nDOCTOR: Of course she is. Don’t worry about it. (TO DRIVER) Anywhere here, thanks.\nTEGAN: This isn’t the park.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got a little business to deal with.\nTEGAN: Sundown Studios. Isn’t that the tv channel on the advert?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 43\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is. The park’s just along there.\nTEGAN: Looks like this place is closing down. The removal men are in.\nDOCTOR: You go on ahead and find the others. I won’t be long.\nTEGAN: Oh. Okay, but what about...\nDOCTOR: (FORCEFUL) Hurry along, Tegan. The others will be waiting\nTEGAN: (TAKEN ABACK) Yeah... right. Well, don’t be long.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, driver. Here. Keep the change.\nDRIVER: Not enough, boss.\nDOCTOR: (SHARP) More? Soon my friend, you’1ll realise you should be paying me.\nDRIVER: Fifty more.\nDOCTOR: Insolent wretch. Tell me, did you ever dream about something like this?\nDOCTOR: I thought not. Something to tell your wastrel family about. Happy New Year.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 44\nNYSSA: When did you start imagining the snake?\nYOANNA: It must be imagining, mustn’t it? I mean, snakes don’t really live in people’s heads.\nNYSSA: (CAUTIOUS) Not usually, no.\nTURLOUGH: I bought some water. Here’s your change.\nYOANNA: Thank you. (SIPS) Oh, yes, that’s better. I’m Yoanna, by the way. Yoanna Rayluss.\nNYSSA: Hello. I’m Nyssa and this is Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Hello.\nYOANNA: It’s just that it won’t seem to shift... this image of the serpent. It’s like a bad dream coiling in and out of my thoughts, and I’m not even asleep. I took a couple of azulin, but it made no difference.\nTURLOUGH: So you thought buying some charms might help the dreams.\nYOANNA: Well... yes. But the silly man didn’t understand. He kept offering me good luck gris-gris’. Well, that’s not right, is it? I mean, what good would a bag of old stones and bones and grave dirt be? That’s just silly.\nTEGAN: (ARRIVING) Hello, you two.\nNYSSA: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Am I relieved to find you. I thought you’d have gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 45\nNYSSA: How was the consultant?\nTEGAN: We-e-ell...\nTURLOUGH: Well?\nTEGAN: It was fine. He says I’m clear! It’s all over. No after- effects!\nNYSSA: Oh Tegan, that’s wonderful! After all that. I’m so glad.\nTURLOUGH: Me too. Well done, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Thanks. Tell you all about it later. I feel like celebrating.\nTURLOUGH: Where’s the Doctor?\nTEGAN: Oh, he stopped somewhere on business or something. He’1ll be along in a minute. He was being a bit cagey though. There’s a lot of strange things and people round here.\nYOANNA: Ahem.\nNYSSA: Oh, I’m sorry. Yoanna, this is our friend, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Hie\nYOANNA: Pleased to meet you. Glad to hear your good news.\nTEGAN: Thanks. I’m a lot better. No more bad dreams.\nYOANNA: Dreams?\nNYSSA: Tegan, I think we should be going.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 46\nYOANNA: Seems to be catching. I’ve been having bad dreams too.\nTEGAN: Really?\nYOANNA: Oh, yes...\nTURLOUGH: All of you... Don’t move!\nTEGAN: What? Oh... cripes.\nNYSSA: It’s a snake.\nYOANNA: It’s there. Get it way from me!

Before the others.\nDOCTOR: (AT A DISTANCE) You!\nBAALA: I’m sorry, sir. The Studio’s closed.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING. MENACING) Where’s Rick ausGarten?\nBAALA: He’s not here, sir. Can I help?\nDOCTOR: Then bring him.\nBAALA: Mr ausGarten is busy elsewhere, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 47\nDOCTOR: What’s going on here?\nBAALA: If it’s about the show tomorrow, I’m afraid it’s “postponed.” There were “safety” issues. They’1l probably show an old film instead.\nDOCTOR: Safety?\nBAALA: (TO WORKMEN) Oh, no gents. Please don’t touch the equipment. That has to be packed properly. Might as well finish off for tonight. Thanks.\nDOCTOR: Is this the thought materialisation machine?\nBAALA: Sorry, sir. Please leave it alone.\nDOCTOR: This crystal is larger scale, but barely adequate for my purpose.\nBAALA: If you call Mr ausG tomorrow, I’m sure we can arrange a meeting.\nDOCTOR: Can I be sure of that?\nBAALA: Yes, sir. What was the name?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I should recruit you to the cause now.\nBAALA: We are very busy.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’ve hardly started, young man. Tell me.\nDOCTOR: What do you see in your darkest dreams?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 48\nBAALA: (MATTER OF FACT) You have a snake on your arm, sir.\nDOCTOR: It is the mark of the Mara!\nBAALA: I’m sorry, sir. It’s just a snake to me. And I never really have dreams. Though other people tell me theirs... at length\nBAALA: sometimes. Sorry, I still didn’t catch your name. There, your snake’s settled down already. Must be sleepy.\nDOCTOR: (DEFLATED) Tell Rick ausGarten that the future is waiting.\nBAALA: Thank you, sir. (CALLING) I’11 tell him you called.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t move. None of you. You’1l frighten the snake!\nYOANNA: It’s searching.\nTEGAN: It’s looking for me. I can’t just stand here.\nNYSSA: It’s fixed on Tegan.\nTEGAN: I knew it.\nYOANNA: Not on me?\nTURLOUGH: (SLOW) The rest of you... back away slowly. No sudden moves.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 49\nTEGAN: Don’t leave me.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan... listen to me. There were always snakes round where I grew up. And if we ran into them, this is what we did. Okay? Very slowly... Slip off your jacket.\nTEGAN: I can’t.\nNYSSA: Do it, Tegan... please.\nTURLOUGH: That’s right. Slip the jacket off.. and bring it round to your front.\nTURLOUGH: Yes, that’s it. Slowly.\nTURLOUGH: No, keep it raised, so that’s what the snake watches. Good. All right. Now... lower the jacket... until the hem touches the ground.\nYOANNA: What’s he doing?\nNYSSA: The snake watches the jacket, not Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Good. Well done.\nTEGAN: Now what?\nTURLOUGH: Keep the jacket in the same place... but you step slowly backwards.\nTURLOUGH: No, don’t move the jacket.\nTURLOUGH: That’s it. As far as you can.\nTEGAN: I can’t reach any further. It’s still watching.\nTURLOUGH: Now... drop the jacket gently to floor. Go on.\nTURLOUGH: And step slowly away.\nNYSSA: It’s still watching the jacket. Well done, Turlough.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 50\nTURLOUGH: That’s okay.\nTEGAN: Can we please get out of here? Ow!\nNYSSA: It’s you again.\nTEGAN: Who’s he?\nYOANNA: Dadda Desaka. Are you following me?\nDADDA: The snake won’t harm you, maams. Not unless you scare her.\nYOANNA: We scare her!\nTEGAN: Don’t touch it!\nDADDA: (SCOOPING UP SNAKE) Come on, old lady. Easy does it. There we are. See? Nothing to be scared of.\nTEGAN: That’s a matter of opinion.\nYOANNA: Dadda, is that your snake?\nDADDA: Here, old lady. A mouse for you.\nTEGAN: Ugh... he’s got a bag full of mice. It’s alive!\nYOANNA: Have you brought livestock into the city?\nDADDA: City folk’s laws don’t count. Laws can’t touch me.\nYOANNA: More’s the pity.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nTURLOUGH: Are you a snakedancer?\nDADDA: Snakeherd, that's me.\nYOANNA: Don’t you bring that thing near me.\nDADDA: Her eyes ain’t so good. But she can taste the (BEAT) No, nothing bad here.\nYOANNA: I should hope not.\nDADDA: And you, young maam? Hmm?\nNYSSA: I’m not entirely sure this is ethical.\nDADDA: Page 51\nDADDA: badness. Hmmm...\nDADDA: Nothing there neither. How about the young fella? Hmm...\nTURLOUGH: (NERVOUS) Is your snake poisonous?\nDADDA: She squeezes. (BEAT) No, less bad than I thought. She tasted\nDADDA: worse.\nTURLOUGH: Thanks.\nDADDA: And how’s about the other maam?\nTEGAN: Keep him away from me.\nNYSSA: It’s alright, Tegan.\nDADDA: She only hurts the bad people. Ah... (STARTS CHANTING WORDLESSLY\nDADDA: AGAIN)\nTEGAN: What’s he saying? Make him stop.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 52\nDADDA: She tastes how there was a shadow in you.\nTEGAN: None of your business. Leave me alone!\nDADDA: She tastes the scars inside. But the shadow’s gone.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan’s fine now, okay?\nDADDA: Time would heal her, yes. But Time is scarred too.\nNYSSA: Please leave her alone.\nTEGAN: What’s he doing?\nYOANNA: He’s having a vision. I wouldn’t touch.\nDADDA: Where is the shadow now? I see it growing... a dark cloud, flooding the sky, eating the sun and the land and the sea. It will swallow Manussa whole!\nDADDA: Where is the shadow now? (GOES ON CHANTING SPELLS)\nTEGAN: (SCARED) Nyssa?\nNYSSA: It’s all right. We can go now.\nTEGAN: But I remember my dream.\nTURLOUGH: You certainly pick your moments.\nTEGAN: Where’s the Doctor?\nYOANNA: The Doctor? Who’s that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 53\nTEGAN: We have to find him. He could be in danger.\nNYSSA: Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Okay. You head back to the TARDIS. I’11 go and look for him.\nNYSSA: Tegan, what happened in your dream?\nTEGAN: The Doctor took the shadow of that... “thing” from me.\nNYSSA: The Mara.\nTEGAN: In my dream, he took it on himself. But what will it do to him?\nTURLOUGH: Where would he go to?\nDOCTOR: Hello Turlough, my old friend.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? You’re here. We were waiting. Nyssa and Tegan are just over there.\nDOCTOR: Careful, careful.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: You've always been good at secrets. Let’s keep this to ourselves a bit longer, eh?\nTURLOUGH: Keep what? Tegan’s upset.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 54\nDOCTOR: Is she, the poor soul?\nTURLOUGH: There was a bit of trouble with an old tribesman.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I saw.\nTURLOUGH: You’ve been watching?\nDOCTOR: (AMUSED) Oh, I’m keeping well clear. And now you’re in on it too, all the better. It’s New Year, so let’s have a bit of fun for a change.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, I don’t understand what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, Turlough. You know, you really have got very dull lately. Where’s the old errant Turlough gone? Always in trouble, always on the make.\nTURLOUGH: I’m still always in trouble.\nDOCTOR: Then why don’t you start to enjoy it, eh? Forget Nyssa and Tegan. Do you seriously think they can’t look after themselves?\nTURLOUGH: Well...\nDOCTOR: That’s better. Leave them to it for a while. Come on, Turlough. Boy’s night out. What do you say?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nDOCTOR WHO: 28. CITY PARK\nNYSSA: We can’t leave him. He’s in some sort of trance.\nYOANNA: I’d better ring social services.\nTEGAN: We could slip away before he wakes up. Come on.\nYOANNA: I thought your friend was a doctor.\nNYSSA: He is... but not the right type.\nTEGAN: Are we going or not?\nNYSSA: No. We have to stay.\nTEGAN: You know, Nyssa, I’ve had it about up to here with Superior attitude.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry?\nTEGAN: You didn’t think I’d get better, did you?\nNYSSA: I don’t know what you mean.\nYOANNA: (WARNING) Both of you, look.\nTEGAN: Little Miss Perfect, aren’t you? While poor little suffers from a weak constitution.\nNYSSA: I never said that.\nTEGAN: That’s not what I heard.\nYOANNA: Oi, break it up, you two.\nYOANNA: your\nYOANNA: Tegan\nYOANNA: Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 56\nTEGAN: And you can stay out of this!\nYOANNA: Will you please look!\nNYSSA: Where did they come from?\nTEGAN: They’ve all carrying snakes.\nYOANNA: The Dadda’s brought his tribe with him. Snakeherders from the Naga’ Hills.\nDADDA: Friends, the meeting is dark and we’re far from home. As we foresaw, a shadow has come to our world. This woman carried it first.\nTEGAN: Now hang on.\nNYSSA: Leave Tegan alone.\nDADDA: But she has no guile. And now the Evil walks amongst us in another shape.\nYOANNA: Excuse me. You can’t all come into the city like this. Who gave you permission to bring indigenous animals off your reservation?\nDADDA: Friends, we must drive out the shadow.\nNYSSA: Do you see? He’s not talking to the tribesmen.\nTEGAN: It’s the snakes he’s talking to. Nyssa, don’t let them near me.\nNYSSA: I won't.\nDADDA: Go now, my friends. Seek out the shadow in the dark.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FAIRGROUND MUSIC — CAROUSEL ORGAN. PEOPLE MILLING.\nKER: TING!

You won the giant cuddly... whatever it is.\nDOCTOR: .but I’m cleverer than you are!\nTURLOUGH: Come away, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’1l remember you!\nTURLOUGH: Get your prize and come on.\nDOCTOR: You have it.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t sulk. You’re supposed to enjoy yourself.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I am, Turlough. Here, stand over here and cover me.\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing? Don’t touch that.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Just leaving him a token of my appreciation.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 58\nTURLOUGH: But that’s holding the tent up.\nDOCTOR: Done it! Whoops.\nSHOWMAN: (INSIDE) Hey!\nTURLOUGH: What did you do that for?\nDOCTOR: Not as satisfying as I’d hoped. Come on.\nTURLOUGH: Wait for me.\nDOCTOR: Keep up, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I’m trying to.\nDOCTOR: Look at the crowds. Leaderless sheep, content in their ignorance. They want for nothing. They desire nothing. (DARKLY) They need stirring up.\nTURLOUGH: (SARCASTIC) That’s a bit subversive, even for you.\nDOCTOR: Not my usual goody-goody self, you mean? Thank goodness for that. What about you, Turlough? What do you want?\nTURLOUGH: Me? I thought this was our night on the town.\nDOCTOR: What was always out of your reach?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know. I suppose I’ve learned to accept things — a bit. You taught me that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 59\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS) Sanctimonious claptrack. You’re as bad as Nyssa. But you’1ll soon learn. (SHOUTS) All of you!\nTURLOUGH: (EMBARRASSED) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You'll all see! You wait ‘til tomorrow night!\nTURLOUGH: Quiet, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And the New Year! (AMUSED) Oh, look.\nTURLOUGH: Now what?\nDOCTOR: Snakes in the grass. Quick, back here. Out of sight. They’re searching for me.\nTURLOUGH: For you? The snakes?\nDOCTOR: I was expected. So let’s give them a run for their money. Is that the park controller's office, do you think?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Where are you going? Hey!

(BEAT. IRRITATED) Scram-pus. Come on, I’ve had a bad day. I’ve got a group of displaced snakeherds on the loose.\nNYSSA: I don’t think the tribesmen are a nuisance.\nTEGAN: Speak for yourself.\nYOANNA: Yes.. snake-herds. And they’ve got snakes with them.\nDADDA: The officer woman understands nothing. The evil must be sought out.\nYOANNA: That’s right. It’s a three one five. Two cars at least. But no Sirens or you’ll start a panic. And bring some nets.\nDOCTOR: (ON TANNOY) Attention please. We are receiving reports of a number of snakes loose in the park.\nYOANNA: What’s he saying?\nDADDA: It is Evil’s voice. It speaks. (HE STARTS TO CHANT WORDLESSLY )\nNYSSA: That’s the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 61\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) These snakes are dangerous. Possibly venomous.\nYOANNA: The absolute idiot!\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) If you see one, report it immediately to park staff. Stay calm. Don’t panic.\nYOANNA: He’s crazy.\nYOANNA: It’s already started. People will be hurt!\nTEGAN: That’s not the Doctor, it’s the... “monster” inside him. It’s taking hold already!\nDADDA: She cannot speak its name. But she knows its nature.\nTEGAN: Too right, I do. We have to stop it!\nNYSSA: Yoanna? Where’s that announcement coming from?\nYOANNA: Park Security Offices.\nTEGAN: That “thing” was bad enough in me. Think what it’1ll be like in the Doctor.\nNYSSA: Tegan means the Mara.\nYOANNA: The Mara? What’s that? (TO PHONE) Hello? Get those cars here now! A three one nine’s starting!\nDADDA: Wait!

This is where it begins.\nTURLOUGH: We should go. Tegan and Nyssa are still waiting.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Oh, yes. The tedious little nun. I have a debt to there.\nTURLOUGH: I’m going back.\nDOCTOR: No, you’re not. You’re in my service now.\nTURLOUGH: Your service? What’s got into you? You’ve changed.\nDOCTOR: Have I? Or have I just taken a turn for the better?\nDOCTOR: Page 62\nDOCTOR: settle\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 63\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: And so will you.

Don’t think I don’t appreciate the offer, but must you be so forceful? (THE DOCTOR RELEASES HIM) Thank you. What is this? Some sort of zoo?\nDOCTOR: It certainly smells like it. Although the hutches suggest an experimental laboratory.\nTURLOUGH: Must be on an industrial scale then. Ugh... look at this. Is ita mutation? It has no skin. How can it even exist?\nTURLOUGH: Or this one. Surely nothing can evolve like that. It’s all feathers and eyes.\nTURLOUGH: And this one. Oh, no. Its legs are all wrong. Facing in opposite directions. It must be fighting itself all the time. There’s a different creature in every hutch. No labels though,\nTURLOUGH: so no names either. Must go for miles.\nDOCTOR: Here’s an empty one. With a blanket inside.\nTURLOUGH: Ow! What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: This’ll do for you, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: (STRUGGLING) Get off!\nDOCTOR: So I can keep an eye on you.

It’s Rick ausGarten’s outfit.\nDADDA: This place is marked with darkness.\nNYSSA: There are certainly no lights on.\nYOANNA: Well, of course there aren’t. I closed the place down. Some people have no regard for public safety.\nDADDA: Too late for that.\nYOANNA: What are you doing here, Dadda? You’re supposed to stay in the park.\nDADDA: This Dadda is holy and wise and untroubled by sad city people’s laws. I go where I like.\nTEGAN: Hang on. This is the tuk-tuk we came in. Surely he can’t still be waiting. (WALKS ACROSS) Hullo. You brought us here this afternoon, remember? Is my friend still here?

Rick ausGarten, celebrity scientist.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nRICK: (SOFTENING) Yeah, well, it helps to have a bit of razzamatazz thrown in. I mean, creating matter from pure thought? It ain’t exactly the main aim of crystal research...\nDOCTOR: . but it still makes science more accessible to the public.\nRICK: Everyone loves a show.\nDOCTOR: And none of these creatures existed before you created them? They all come from the 4D crystals?\nRICK: Bit of a by-product really. You start projecting the image of a flower... shape, texture, scent... but then these critters turn up too. Birds, animals. I thought we’d got that problem sorted until today.\nDOCTOR: Pure thought is rarely pure. The subconscious always seeps through.\nRICK: See this one? Two heads with plumage like water? Sings duets with itself. Real class, that is.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating.\nRICK: And along here... this is our snake tank.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 69\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes.\nRICK: We get more of them than anything — all colours and shapes. Funny that. They’re agitated tonight. Normally they sleep all day.\nDOCTOR: But are they evolution or art?\nRICK: Ooh, too deep for me, Doctor. So.. are you rescuing me or what? Go on. Make me an offer.\nDOCTOR: You need funding. I can provide that. And influence too.\nRICK: I like it. Tell me more.\nDOCTOR: You'll have a team of A-list celebrities to endorse tomorrow night’s premiere.\nRICK: Tomorrow? You’ll be lucky. They closed me down, remember?\nDOCTOR: It won’t be a problem.\nRICK: So what’s the catch?\nDOCTOR: (IRRITATED) Catch?\nRICK: Everyone wants something. You might as well tell me. I’1l1 only\nRICK: end up worrying.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll start with Manussa.\nRICK: Eh? You want the world? Don’t we all? Here, what are doing?\nDOCTOR: Your snakes.

Oh no.\nTURLOUGH: It’s not him. As if he’s... like someone else!\nDADDA: The Evil moves amongst us. First it slides, then it walks.\nTURLOUGH: We have to get out!\nYOANNA: I agree. Everyone out now. Clear the place until the Safety Officers arrive. And don’t touch anything.\nNYSSA: Don’t move.\nYOANNA: What?\nNYSSA: There’s a snake by the door. Keep back!\nTEGAN: Oh, no!\nTURLOUGH: Back away...\nNYSSA: And another behind you!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 75\nTEGAN: They’re all over the place...\nYOANNA: Dadda?

Still checking up on me, are you?\nYOANNA: It’s my job, Mr ausGarten. You’re keeping dangerous livestock on these premises. You didn’t inform me of that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 76\nTEGAN: It’s him. He was on the adverts...\nRICK: A few research specimens got loose. That’s all. They won’t hurt if you leave them alone.\nYOANNA: They’re not like any snakes I’ve ever seen.\nRICK: Then put that in your report too. Now get out... and take this old witch doctor with you. I’ve had enough of him round here.\nDADDA: Your words are lies. The dark snake has already bitten you.\nRICK: I said get out!\nNYSSA: Who was that screaming?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, just come away.\nRICK: It’s a tv show. You’1ll have to tune in to find out.\nYOANNA: Your show’s been cancelled.\nRICK: News to me.\nYOANNA: What else are you hiding?\nTEGAN: And where’s the Doctor?

Our days turn to night.\nYOANNA: It’s him. I saw him. The fair-haired man standing in the dark heart of the rose.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t look at his eyes.\nDOCTOR: (AMUSED) I knew you’d follow me. Ever angry Tegan, Turlough the truculent youth and Saint Nyssa the Interminably Reproachful.\nNYSSA: What’s happened to you?\nDOCTOR: One guess, little nun.\nTEGAN: Oh, Doctor... no. Is that what you took away from me?\nDOCTOR: Just as well. It’s a miracle anything survives trapped in your tiny mind. But with me, the possibilities are endless!\nTEGAN: Not if I stop you first!\nNYSSA: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Take a look in my mirror!\nTEGAN: You can’t, can you? You can’t look at yourself!\nDOCTOR: Give me that! (HE LUNGES)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 78\nDOCTOR: And now you’re all in the Mara’s power!\nDOCTOR: (FX: MAIN DOOR CRASHES OPEN. A SQUAD OF SAFETY POLICE THUNDER IN)\nTURLOUGH: It’s the police.\nYOANNA: At last!\nPOLICEMAN: Safety Enforcement! No-one move!\nYOANNA: About time too!\nPOLICEMAN: That one!\nTURLOUGH: Me! Ow! Get off me!\nPOLICEMAN: And that one!\nTEGAN: The Doctor?\nNYSSA: Locking up the Doctor won’t help.\nPOLICEMAN: You’re both under arrest for public disturbances at Scrampus Park this afternoon.\nTURLOUGH: But I didn’t do anything!\nPOLICEMAN: Take them away.\nYOANNA: I'll follow you, sergeant. I need a warrant to close these studios permanently.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: Where’s ausGarten gone?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. He was here just now.\nDADDA: Evil cannot be subdued so easily. It will spread like dark fire through the tinder.\nYOANNA: With due respect, Dadda, isn’t “Evil” going a bit far?\nTEGAN: Not in this case, it’s not. The Doctor’s possessed by that... that. “thing.”\nNYSSA: The Mara.\nTEGAN: (A SHIVER DOWN HER SPINE).. that word.\nDADDA: Yoanna, you saw him in your mind’s eye.\nYOANNA: No. No, that’s just fantasy. The Doctor’s disturbed. That’s why I’m taking him in for questioning. At least let’s understand him before we condemn him as a maniac.\nYOANNA: 37. WAREHOUSE\nRICK: Baala? You in there? (BEAT) Come on. Out you come.\nBAALA: (MUFFLED UNDER BLANKET) Go away.\nRICK: Now where could Baalaka be? Is he under the blanket? Shall we look, children?\nBAALA: There are snakes out there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 80\nRICK: Come on! There’s work needs doing.\nBAALA: Has he gone, that man? The scary one.\nRICK: The Doc?\nBAALA: He had a friend too. He wasn’t cruel. He knew about being scared.\nRICK: The SEs were here. They took them away for a basting, the idiots.\nBAALA: Mr ausG... (WEEPING) I thought you were hurt. Or worse.\nRICK: Me? Baala, I’ve never felt better. We’ve got ourselves a backer. The Doctor’s coughing up. The Dreamarama show's on again.\nBAALA: (FIGHTING TEARS) Again?\nRICK: With proper funding this time. No more takeaway noodle buckets\nRICK: for us.\nBAALA: But the Doctor’s been locked up — you just said. And half the equipment’s gone.\nRICK: Then we get it back. Come on. Out you come.\nRICK: That’s it. We’ve got one day to get back on track. So let’s burn the tyres. (BEAT) What are you staring at?\nBAALA: That mark on your arm. The snake.\nBAALA: It’s the same mark the Doctor had.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 81\nTEGAN: It’s cold. What are we hanging about here for? Shouldn’t we try and see the Doctor?\nNYSSA: Did you notice the equipment in the studio?\nTEGAN: Don’t you care? It’s my fault, Nyssa. He’s in that state because of me. (BEAT) Sorry. You’re trying to keep me busy, aren’t you?\nNYSSA: If it helps. The studio’s set up to create living matter from thought energy...\nTEGAN: I’d gathered that.\nNYSSA: . uSing crystal technology.\nTEGAN: Must be state of the art round here. Dr Kerrem was using that for my brain scan. He was a nice man when we met him, maybe he could help.\nNYSSA: Well, I took a look at the crystals in the studio equipment.\nTEGAN: So?\nNYSSA: The crystals are blue — industrially grown sapphires. They’re bigger versions of the Little Mind’s Eye that the Doctor was using to reach into your subconscious.\nTEGAN: (SCARED) Nyssa... why didn’t I make that connection? Jeez, I could kick myself. You mean they’re smaller versions of the Great Mind’s Eye — the crystal that snake “thing” will use one day to become real.\nNYSSA: I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: But that’s years in the future... centuries yet, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: I hope so, Tegan. For all our sakes, I hope that’s right.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: 39. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM\nPOLICEMAN: (ON INTERCOM) Your expert’s arrived.\nYOANNA: Send him in.\nKERREM: Yoanna. A pleasure to see you as always.\nYOANNA: Good to see you, Dr Kerrem. I needed an independent expert. Thank goodness you were in the building.\nKERREM: Right. And which is the subject in question?\nYOANNA: The taller fair-haired man at the back of the cell.\nKERREM: (DARKLY) Ah, yes... (PICKING UP AGAIN) And you’d like to me to give him a remote brain scan?\nYOANNA: Please.\nKERREM: Well, he seems docile enough. What’s he in for?\nYOANNA: Breaking and entering; causing a public disturbance. And he had a bit of a run-in, if that’s the right word, with a vagrant tribesman — a mystic. One “Dadda Desaka” from the Naga Hill tribes.\nKERREM: A mystic? One of the Untouchables?\nYOANNA: More’s the pity. Otherwise I’d haul him in too. The Dadda was insisting that our subject here is “The Evil One” incarnate.\nKERREM: Superstitious hogwash.\nYOANNA: I know... except... well, I’m inclined to agree. Maybe not Evil, not as such, but there’s something nasty and disturbing about him. He led us quite a dance this afternoon, causing chaos all over the city. And he has this obsession with snakes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 83\nKERREM: That hardly warrants a scan, you know.\nYOANNA: Yes, but also... (AWKWARD) well, I do try to be rational. It’s my job. Safety issues and everything. But... erm...\nKERREM: Hmm? Something else?\nYOANNA: Well... oh no, never mind. I’m being silly. I just imagined it.\nKERREM: What about the younger subject? He looks scared. If the Doctor’s such a villain, should they both be in the same cell?\nYOANNA: How did you know he’s a Doctor? We don’t even have a name.\nKERREM: The erm... arrest report. I saw it on my way in.\nKERREM: 40. POLICE CELL\nTURLOUGH: They’re bound to be watching.\nDOCTOR: (BORED) Very probably.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Doctor is no longer available, I’m delighted to say.\nTURLOUGH: Please... try and remember who you are... What about Nyssa and Tegan? And everything we’ve been through together? You saved me from public school, and the Black Guardian. I was a wreck and I owe you my life. Don't you remember Helheim and the Cractids? Purity Bay, when the Takers came? (BEAT) And what about your home?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 84\nDOCTOR: None of your business.\nTURLOUGH: Your TARDIS. You can’t loose that. It’s part of you. We could get you away from here. (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SCARED, TINY) Turlough? Is that you?\nTURLOUGH: Yes, I’m here.\nDOCTOR: What’s happening to me? I can’t remember anymore. Am Ia monster now? People seem to think I’m a monster.\nTURLOUGH: No. No, Doctor. Of course you’re not.\nDOCTOR: Then who am I? Because I’ve no idea, you see. None at all.\nTURLOUGH: You’re the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ugh... my head. It’s kicking and rolling in there like an unborn child. It’1ll crack open like an egg!\nTURLOUGH: We have to get you help! Help! Please! He’s not well!\nDOCTOR: (CALMING) It’s hot in here, isn’t it? Please... I need to... help me off with my coat.\nTURLOUGH: Okay. Come on then. That’s it.\nDOCTOR: What is it? Don’t look at me like that... what did you say your\nDOCTOR: name was?\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET DESPAIR) Doctor... Where will we be without you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 85\nDOCTOR: (STARTS TO LAUGH) You should see your face.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: All that concern. It was just a joke, Turlough, old chum! I’m\nDOCTOR: stronger than I ever was! (LAUGHS)\nTURLOUGH: I should have known.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. I still want your help. I’ve got all sorts of tricks up my sleeve. Look!\nTURLOUGH: No!\nDOCTOR: It’s yours, Turlough. The Mark of the Mara. Take it!\nTURLOUGH: It’s moving! Keep it away from me!\nTURLOUGH: Let me out of here!\nTURLOUGH: Get me out! Let me out! Please! Let me go! Let me out! Get me out of here! Etc...\nDOCTOR: (OVER TURLOUGH) Excuse me while I make a quick call.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: 41. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM\nYOANNA: He’s got a snake in there! Get the boy out!\nPOLICEMAN: (INTERCOM) On it now.\nYOANNA: I thought they’d been searched. How’s he got a snake with him? And a phone!\nKERREM: Hello? Yes... yes. Of course.\nYOANNA: He called you! From the cell. You know him!\nKERREM: Out of my way!\nKERREM: (FX: HE GRABS YOANNA AND FLINGS HER ASIDE.\nYOANNA: Aaaargh! No!\nYOANNA: (FX: A CHAIR CLATTERS TO THE FLOOR. A MUFFLED ALARM SOUNDS OUTSIDE. KERREM OPENS THE DOOR. THE ALARM GETS LOUDER. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: 42. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ALARM SOUNDING\nDOCTOR WHO: A POLICEMAN FURTHER UP THE CORRIDOR YELLS IN PAIN.\nFURNITURE: CRASHES )\nDOCTOR: (FAR END OF CORRIDOR) Kerrem!\nKERREM: Doctor! Down here!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) That is no longer my name. Get me out this place!\nPOLICEMAN: 2 (FAR END OF CORRIDOR) Hey!\nPOLICEMAN: (FX: HE RUNS TOWARDS US. A LEFT HOOK FLOORS HIM)\nKERREM: This way!\nKERREM: (FX: THE DOCTOR AND KERREM BARREL THROUGH A DOOR AND CLATTER DOWN A FIRE ESCAPE)\nDOCTOR: Where’s your car?\nKERREM: I came by taxi.\nDOCTOR: Then we’ll take a police vehicle. That one. The blue one.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: 43. POLICE CELL\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor attacked me. It looks like he attacked you too.\nYOANNA: That was Dr Kerrem. One of our “regular” experts. I mean, who can you trust these days? Where did the Doctor get that snake from?\nTURLOUGH: I hoped you’d tell me. It was on his arm.. like a tattoo, and then it came alive.\nYOANNA: (RECOILING) It’s not still here!\nTURLOUGH: No. No, he took it with him.\nYOANNA: I knew he was trouble.\nYOANNA: Oh, that’s better. I couldn’t hear myself think.\nTURLOUGH: But he’s not like this... not normally... not trouble, I mean.\nYOANNA: The Dadda thought he was. He said the Doctor was possessed by... what did he call it?\nTURLOUGH: The Mara. Some sort of evil spirit.\nYOANNA: That’1ll look good in my report.\nTURLOUGH: But what did you say?\nYOANNA: When?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 89\nTURLOUGH: Earlier. At the studio. You said you recognised the Doctor. The man at the heart of the rose?\nYOANNA: Excuse me. Who’s questioning whom here?\nTURLOUGH: Look. I’m new to all this. It’s Tegan and Nyssa who really know.\nYOANNA: Your friends?\nTURLOUGH: Yes. Whatever he’s doing now, the Doctor needs help.\nYOANNA: This interview is off the record, you know... my reputation’s tarnished enough. And frankly, it’s obvious you’re not to blame.\nTURLOUGH: Thanks.\nYOANNA: So.. do you know where to find your friends?\nTURLOUGH: I think so.\nYOANNA: And you'd bring them to me?\nTURLOUGH: If you’ll agree to help the Doctor.\nYOANNA: A fine New Year this is turning out to be. All right. Bring them here. You’re free to go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: 44. POLICE CAR/MARKET\nDOCTOR: Get this car moving, Kerrem.\nKERREM: Blasted New Year shoppers. It’d be quicker to walk. And safer to lose this police car.\nDOCTOR: A shame. That irony is amusing, don’t you think?.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THEY OPEN THE CAR DOORS AND CLAMBER OUT. MARKET SOUNDS ALL\nROUND: THEM)\nKERREM: Through here.\nDOCTOR: What about my list? The greatest intellects Manussa can offer.\nKERREM: Too clever by half, most of them.\nDOCTOR: And so? Who have you got?\nKERREM: No one.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean... no one?\nKERREM: I’ve a list as long as your arm. My secretary spent the day calling them. But no one’s interested. They’re all suddenly busy, or away for the holiday.\nDOCTOR: At every turn: incompetence, bureaucracy. Which way is ausGarten’s Studio?\nKERREM: Not far. At the top end of the market.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 91\nDOCTOR: The Mara will be born today. The New Age will begin. Even if I do everything myself! .. Wait.\nKERREM: What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: (SLAPPING POCKETS) The key. The key to the Doctor’s ship. It’s missing. Turlough!\nDOCTOR: 45. PARK NYSSA AND TEGAN WALKING. BOTH EXHAUSTED.\nNYSSA: I knew we should have tried the Police Station.\nTEGAN: The TARDIS must be round here somewhere. It all looks different after dark.\nNYSSA: Assuming the Doctor or Turlough do actually come back.\nTEGAN: Where else would they go? They’re bound to have escaped by now.\nNYSSA: It depends what state the Doctor’s in.\nTEGAN: Look! There you are. The TARDIS. I told you.\nNYSSA: But what’s happened to it?\nTEGAN: Garlands and chains? Someone’s been busy. What’s that all about?\nDADDA: Do not touch the casket. It carried the Evil here.\nNYSSA: Dadda Desaka.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 92\nTEGAN: Are you waiting for us?\nDADDA: When the Evil returns, I shall challenge it and drive it out.\nNYSSA: I’m not sure that’s a good idea.\nDADDA: That is the path I tread to find Parami.\nTEGAN: But you can’t fight it like that. The Doctor took that... “thing” out of me. He was protecting me. If you fight it, you’ll hurt him.\nDADDA: Child, Evil cannot be defeated until it is named.\nTEGAN: No.. I can’t say that w-word. Don’t make me. It’s horrible.\nDADDA: Name your enemy.\nTEGAN: I can’t even name the Doctor!\nNYSSA: It’s hard for her. Please leave her alone.\nDOCTOR: (FAR OFF) Nyssa? Tegan?\nDADDA: Too late. The Evil itself comes.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING. VERY FIERCE) Where’s the thief? Where’s Turlough?!\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nTEGAN: I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m sorry for what I caused.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor is dead!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 93\nTEGAN: No! No, you’re not!\nDOCTOR: Where’s Turlough? Tell me? He stole the key!\nNYSSA: He can’t get into the TARDIS!\nDADDA: Stand aside, Demon. I bar your way.\nDOCTOR: Old man, you are nothing. I am the Mara...\nTEGAN: No!\nDOCTOR: .and I will crush your soul and feed it to the ghosts that hunger in the dark beyond the world!\nDADDA: The darkness where you belong!\nDOCTOR: Stand aside!\nDADDA: The way is barred. Choose your weapon.\nNYSSA: Please be careful!\nTEGAN: The old man can’t fight the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll tear you apart with my bare hands!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DADDA SWINGS HIS STAFF SEVERAL TIMES. THE DOCTOR DUCKS AND THEN CATCHES THE STAFF WITH A SNARL.\nDADDA: CRIES OUT)\nNYSSA: No, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Old fool! You didn’t expect to beat me, did you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 94\nTEGAN: There go his mice.. running all over.\nNYSSA: And his snake.\nTURLOUGH: (ARRIVES, BREATHLESS) Nyssa, Tegan...\nNYSSA: Turlough! You’re safe.\nTURLOUGH: I’ve got the key.\nDOCTOR: Serve the Mara well, old fool.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MARA STING.\nTURLOUGH: FITS THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND OPENS THE TARDIS DOOR)\nTURLOUGH: Quick. Get in the TARDIS. While he’s busy.\nTEGAN: But the old man...\nTURLOUGH: Just get inside.\nDOCTOR: Take the Mark of the Snake!\nCRIES: OUT WEAKLY.\nDOCTOR: Turlough? Is that you? Stop!\nDOCTOR: Turlough! Let me in!\nDOCTOR: Let me into the ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: 46. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: That poor old man...\nTURLOUGH: Don’t let the Doctor in!\nTEGAN: We could get him away from Manussa.\nNYSSA: The Mara would take us over too. And then head out into the Universe.\nTURLOUGH: There must be a way to stop it...\nNYSSA: The Dadda would have known. But there must be information in the TARDIS. What about the library?\nTEGAN: Hang on... the Doctor’s making a call.\nTURLOUGH: I can’t tell what he’s saying.\nTURLOUGH: 47. PARK\nDOCTOR: (ON PHONE) ausGarten? Set up your dream forming machines. I’ve a job for them... Yes, now! I’1ll be with you shortly. Let’s see how well they really work.\nDADDA: Time turns on this point. The paths change. The old Destiny\nDADDA: falters and dies. Now the Mara spins the future.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Old man. We have work to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: 48. TARDIS LIBRARY\nTURLOUGH: I didn't know the TARDIS's library was quite so vast. It would help if we knew what we were looking for.\nTEGAN: None of these books has been taken down for years.\nNYSSA: Look for anything to do with demons and legends.\nTURLOUGH: It’s not exactly scientific, is it? We’d be better off if there was a fantasy section.\nTEGAN: Well, what about this? On the desk. An Universal Historie of Fable and Demonology — written at the Ende of Alle Time.\nNYSSA: Can I see?\nTEGAN: The Doctor must have looked at it recently.\nNYSSA: It’s alphabetical. That helps.\nTURLOUGH: Well, go on then. M is for... (Mara)\nTEGAN: Just look, will you!\nTURLOUGH: sorry.\nNYSSA: Even the pages are heavy.\nTURLOUGH: No... go further on.\nNYSSA: I know. Now... M...\nTURLOUGH: It must be there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 97\nNYSSA: Manticore... Mapyay... Marabou... Mardi gras... Where is it? There should be a page on its history and lore.\nTURLOUGH: There was. It’s been torn out.\nNYSSA: Torn out...\nTEGAN: But who would...? Oh, no.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor.\nNYSSA: The Mara in the Doctor. It’s been reading its own history like a book of instructions.\nNYSSA: 49. RICK’S STUDIO\nRICK: All set, Dark One?\nDOCTOR: I’m waiting.\nRICK: Baala? (BEAT) Come on, Baalaka! My Lord Mara’s waiting. Start the scan.\nBAALA: (UNEASY) Yes, Mr ausG.\nDOCTOR: Your assistant is beginning to annoy me.\nBAALA: Dreammaker now scanning.\nRICK: Please visualise your object.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 98\nERP: levels are high.\nRICK: Compensate as required.\nBAALA: I am. It’s not responding. ERPs still rising.\nDOCTOR: (GRITTED TEETH) Don’t compensate. Let it find its own level.\nRICK: What about the crystals...!\nBAALA: Image forming in chamber... It’s overloading!\nRICK: Cut the power! Baala!\nBAALA: Powering down now.\nRICK: Oi, Baala! No lip, right! Or your borrowed time runs out! Doctor? You all right?\nDOCTOR: Your crystals wouldn’t take the power.\nRICK: They’re the best I’ve got. I mortgaged my life away to buy those. I’m still paying.\nDOCTOR: They’re inadequate. The Mara needs a crystal with four times the potential.\nRICK: No chance.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 99\nDOCTOR: Then my time was wasted.\nKERREM: Ahem... Sorry to cut in.\nDOCTOR: Dr Kerrem?\nKERREM: But there is such a perfect crystal. The largest they’ve created so far. I think they only grew it to prove they could.\nDOCTOR: Where?\nKERREM: At the Faculty of Advancement.\nRICK: They’1l never hand that over.\nKERREM: Oh now, I always have a few expense discrepancy strings to play with. Leave it to me.\nDOCTOR: Kerrem, consider yourself redeemed.\nKERREM: If I could just have my phone back.\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS) Of course.\nRICK: Glad somebody’s laughing.\nDOCTOR: I will be... soon.\nRICK: When we’ve still no show tonight? No studio rabble or Great Minds to entertain them?\nDOCTOR: We’1ll make do. Who needs star names anyway? I’ve already recruited the Minds I need. Bar one, that is.\nBAALA: Mr ausG?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 100\nRICK: Now what?\nBAALA: This was in the isolation chamber. On the floor.\nRICK: A key? It’s a key everyone!\nDOCTOR: The key to the Doctor’s ship. Just as I imagined it. You’re machine worked, Rick. Baala, give it to me.\nRICK: Go on, Baala. He won’t bite.\nRICK: He’s scared.\nDOCTOR: He terrifies me too. Still, we’re back on track again. The Mara will be born tonight. One more mind, that’s all I need. And now I know where to find it.\nDOCTOR: 50. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTURLOUGH: We brought you some tea.\nNYSSA: Oh, thanks.\nTEGAN: And I found some cake. It might be from Christmas. Don't know how old, though. But these things improve with age, don’t they?\nNYSSA: Thanks, Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Have you had any sleep?\nNYSSA: Not really. I have to work this through. According to the\nTARDIS: data bank, we’re in the Manussan year Two Two One Five.\nTEGAN: Right.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 101\nNYSSA: But the History Section puts the overthrow of the Manussan Empire by the SuMaran regime at Two Three Two Six. Over a hundred years from now.\nTEGAN: So we're too early. The disaster doesn’t happen yet! Oh... I don’t know what to say. Thank you, Nyssa.\nTURLOUGH: You are certain of that?\nNYSSA: Check the dates for yourself.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, I believe you.\nTEGAN: So we've nothing to worry about.\nNYSSA: Well...\nTURLOUGH: You’re not so sure, are you?\nNYSSA: The Doctor respects the Web of Time--\nTURLOUGH: But we’re not dealing with the Doctor. And would the Mara in him really care?\nNYSSA: It’s already come this far. Changing history won’t bother it.\nTEGAN: But the Doctor’s still alive.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan...\nTEGAN: That “monster’s” choking him. But he’s still alive. We can’t leave him! Not now!\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 102\nDOCTOR: Well, well. Here you all are. I thought you’d have gone and abandoned your old friend. But you didn’t even have the wit to do that.\nTEGAN: Doctor? Are you still there? Please!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Still in shock that I threw you over?\nDOCTOR: And Turlough! Trying and failing to outwit me... as usual. And brave, sanctimonious Nyssa — the clever one. Working tirelessly to spread goodness and understanding across the ever-corrupting cosmos. Maybe we’ll make a shrine for you.\nTURLOUGH: Leave her alone. You’re not the Doctor.\nTEGAN: You haven’t won. You’re too early. It’s not the right time.\nDOCTOR: Rules are there to be broken. I can be the Doctor again — if you like. But I’ve chosen you, Nyssa, little nun, to be one of my Ministers when the New Order takes over tonight.\nNYSSA: No!\nTURLOUGH: Don’t you touch her!\nDOCTOR: Be quiet!\nTEGAN: No!\nDOCTOR: (ADVANCING) There was a young lady from Traken\nNYSSA: Keep away from me!\nDOCTOR: Who picked the wrong doorway to darken\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 103\nTURLOUGH: Leave her!\nTURLOUGH: (FX: TURLOUGH GRABS THE DOCTOR. THE SNAKE HISSES. TURLOUGH GASPS AND FALLS BACK)\nDOCTOR: But due to a blunder She’s now lying under\nTEGAN: Get away from her! Leave her alone!\nDOCTOR: A place...\nNYSSA: No...\nDOCTOR: .f£or the TARDIS to park on!\nTEGAN: Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: Welcome, Nyssa, to my band of disciples.\nNYSSA: (AMUSED) Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Not far. Half a mile east. A few hours forward. It takes the tedium out of hanging around.\nNYSSA: Oh, good. I do hate having to wait.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: 51. RICK’S STUDIO\nBAALA: Stand by studio.\nRICK: Lord Mara, where were you?\nDOCTOR: Busy. Is everyone set?\nBALAAKA: Transmission in 60 seconds.\nRICK: We thought we’d have to cancel and pay the crew in tin tacks.\nDOCTOR: And the new crystal? Is it here? Kerrem?\nKERREM: All ready, Lord Mara. Installed as you requested.\nRICK: We spent the day racking up the technology for extra capacity. Runs like a dream.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. So, here we are, my friends. On the verge, eh? You all understand your duties? Honri Kerrem?\nKERREM: Lord Mara.\nDOCTOR: Dadda Desaka?\nDADDA: Mighty Dark One, I am honoured to be your servant.\nDOCTOR: Rick ausGarten?\nBAALA: Live in 30 seconds.\nRICK: Revving on the grid, boss man.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 105\nDOCTOR: And this is the final member of our team. The exalted lady Nyssa of Traken.\nNYSSA: Good evening, gentlemen.\nRICK: Nice one.\nKERREM: Good evening, young lady.\nDADDA: Welcome, child.\nNYSSA: Dadda, I like your suit.\nRICK: Take your seats round the crystal. This one’s the big moment.\nBAALA: Transmission in 5... 4... 3...\nDOCTOR: Everyone ready. Good luck, Manussa.\nRICK: Welcome to a New Year’s Eve special on Sundown Channel. Glad you could join us for Dreamarama.\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) Tegan? They don’t seem bothered about us.\nTEGAN: They don’t care. They’re so sure of themselves.\nTURLOUGH: We can’t just stand and watch.\nTEGAN: I don’t know what we do. Short of smashing that crystal.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 106\nRICK: You join us live as an extraordinary experiment takes place. Tonight, a team of celebrities will prove that dreams can come true. (UNDER TEGAN & TURLOUGH) With the help of advanced crystal technology, we’ll be giving their thoughts physical substance.\nTURLOUGH: What are they playing at?\nTEGAN: It’s the end of this world. A century early. They’re bringing the Mara back to life!\nDOCTOR: Thank you, team. Please concentrate your thoughts on the first subject.\nRICK: And the first experiment has already kicked off.\nBAALA: Commencing scanning.\nRICK: The team’s thought potential focuses through the special giant Dreammaker crystal. And their dream becomes reality there in the isolation booth.\nRICK: So now let’s see if their dreams really do come true!\nTEGAN: I can’t let this happen!\nTURLOUGH: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Stop it! Stop it! You don’t know what you’re doing!\nTURLOUGH: You have to stop this!\nRICK: Security? Get them away from there!\nTURLOUGH: Get off me!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nTEGAN: Let me go! Nyssa! Help us!\nBAALA: Image forming.\nTEGAN: No! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Welcome!\nBAALA: Subject consolidating.\nTURLOUGH: Agh! It’s a snake! A giant snake!\nDOCTOR: The Mara! The Mara is reborn! It lives again!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART 3.\nDOCTOR: Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: Part 4.\nDOCTOR WHO: 51. RICK’S STUDIO (continued)\nBAALA: Image forming.\nTEGAN: No! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Welcome!\nBAALA: Subject consolidating.\nTURLOUGH: Agh! It’s a snake! A giant snake!\nDOCTOR: The Mara! The Mara is reborn! It lives again!\nDOCTOR: Welcome! We greet you as our Protector!\nRICK: (TO CAMERA) As you can see, after a bit of a ruckus from protesters, the first manifestation of our Dreammaker has come as quite a surprise.\nRICK: Let’s talk to one of the team who quite literally thought it up. Dr Honri Kerrem of the Faculty of Advancement. So is that what you planned?\nKERREM: (EXCITED) Magnificent, isn’t it? And appropriate too. The Great Serpent is one of the ancient emblems of Manussa.\nRICK: And still growing as well.\nKERREM: It certainly is. But only just born — let’s not forget that. A living creature that never existed before today has been brought into our world. Matter from pure thought energy. And, I believe, a turning point for us all. Extraordinary!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: 52. MONITOR ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: [UNDER TEGAN AND TURLOUGH’S EXCHANGES, THE TINNY STUDIO FEED\nSTILL BURBLES ON: ]\nRICK: You must be very proud.\nKERREM: My goodness, yes.\nRICK: Nothing to worry about though. It seems to be quite safe.\nKERREM: Well, I wouldn’t call it “safe.” But it is customising itself to new surroundings.\nRICK: Indeed. So no flash photos or anything. And it’s a big welcome to viewers already joining us on major channels right across Manussa. A bit of New Year schedule-sweeping going on, I think.\nKERREM: Goodness, yes\nRICK: I’m Rick ausGarten and here we are at Sundown Studios in Pura City where the first ever televised creation of a living creature from pure thought has produced this magnificent serpent. Through the programme, we’ll be tracing the history and birth of this incredible experiment and looking at how it’ll effect us all. Quite a milestone, I think you’ll all agree...].\nTURLOUGH: Maybe we’re safer in here for the moment.\nTEGAN: It won’t last.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry, Tegan. I never knew it would be so...\nTEGAN: Monstrous? Evil?\nTURLOUGH: Horrible. I thought I was used to snakes. But the way it moves. It’s solid muscle. It’s so strong.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 110\nTEGAN: And hateful. The Doctor stopped it before. Twice over. But this time...\nTURLOUGH: But it doesn’t talk.\nTEGAN: It’s an influence. It lives through people — through their worst features. That’s what it preys on. I know that, believe me. It stirs things up to feed and grow. It’1ll start a reign of terror right across Manussa.\nTURLOUGH: With the Doctor and Nyssa as its chief advocates. But how do we save them?\nTEGAN: I’ve had enough of listening to this.\nTURLOUGH: Look. Through the glass.\nTEGAN: What’s he staring at?\nTURLOUGH: It’s Baala. (GESTICULATING) Baala! Remember me? Please. Let us out. No, don’t go!\nTEGAN: I thought he worked for ausGarten.\nTURLOUGH: He gets treated like a dog. He even sleeps with the other animals. And he still comes back for more.\nTEGAN: Maybe that’s what we’ll all get.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: 53. STUDIO\nRICK: To help us take in the significance of this amazing manifestation, I’m going to hand over to my colleague, the Doctor, who’ll explain some of the background.\nDOCTOR: (COLD) Not a Doctor now, Rick. (PRESENTER MODE) Well, it’s quite a night here, and to help me explain the importance of what the Great Snake, this symbol of power, will mean to all of us on Manussa — because that’s very much what it is, a symbol of world power — I’m joined by revered mystic Dadda Desaka.\nDADDA: Happy New Year to you all.\nDOCTOR: And to you. Now you were part of our team, our spiritual guide so to speak, who assisted in this summoning.\nDADDA: (SUDDEN SOPHISTICATION — THOUGHT FOR THE DAY MODE) I think the world and its Empire should be rejoicing. You know, as our world grows more advanced, we regrettably lose sight of the old wisdom and truth we once knew and lived by. But tonight, as I’m sure you’ll agree, a great wonder has come amongst us.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nDADDA: Now the Snake, the Mara, is of course, an ancient totem. And it’s revealed itself in its true form as our Protector — a symbol of the new strength of Manussa. Its light will strike fear into our enemies and bring us victory against all adversity and darkness. So good Manussans, look into your own hearts. For the Mara is there. It is the hope that drives back the despair in all of us.\nDOCTOR: Very uplifting, exalted Dadda. Thank you. And in recognition of this momentous occasion, the Snake, the Mara itself, is accepting offerings and sacrifices for the dawn of its New Age. Call this number to make your pledges now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: The Great Snake will make its first public appearance at midnight here at Sundown Studio, Pura City. (UNDER REAL DOCTOR LINE) And if you can’t be here, watch the full coverage on Sundown Channel. We’1ll be back an hour before midnight. See you then.\nREAL: DOCTOR (OVER DOCTOR) (LOST, AFRAID) Please... please listen to me.. I’m the Doctor. Help me please.\nREAL: 54. STUDIO\nRICK: (OFF) Right, clear the studio. Thank you everyone. Oi, Baala. What are you doing?\nBAALA: (QUIET) Hello, Snake.\nRICK: (OFF) Baala, get away from there!\nBAALA: What enemies? What was he saying? I don’t understand. Manussa doesn’t have enemies.\nRICK: (GRABBING BAALA) Come on, come away. Back to work. Sort out some of the livestock, will you? Sooner or later, our “Great Protector’s” gonna need feeding.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: 55. MONITOR ROOM\nTURLOUGH: People aren’t going to fall for that.\nTEGAN: They’1ll be too terrified to argue. The Snake’s very persuasive.\nTURLOUGH: What about Nyssa? If we could talk to her...\nTEGAN: You think she’d listen? There must be another way.\nTURLOUGH: (CAUTIOUS) We erm... still have a key to the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: And leave them!\nTURLOUGH: We may have to.\nTEGAN: Don’t even think about it, Turlough!\nBAALA: Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Baala. I didn’t think you’d come back.\nBAALA: I brought you some food.\nTEGAN: Like the rest of the livestock?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Sorry. Thanks, but I’m not really hungry.\nTURLOUGH: Thanks, Baala.\nBAALA: You were scared of the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: Yes, well now you know why.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 114\nBAALA: But what does he want? Why did he dream the Snake alive?\nTEGAN: It’s the Snake that controls things. It was waiting to be created. It thrives on the chaos it causes.\nBAALA: And that happens tonight. Everything changes. Can you feel it? The air’s full of anger and hate.\nTURLOUGH: Baala, don’t stay here. Go home to your family.\nBAALA: I never had a family.\nTEGAN: What about friends you could go to? Where did you grow up?\nBAALA: I don’t know. I never “grew up.” I was always this age.\nTEGAN: (CONFUSED) Right...\nTURLOUGH: Baala? Is there a private line — to call Yoanna Rayluss?\nTEGAN: Yoanna?\nTURLOUGH: She’s not here... not part of the party. Maybe she can get the plug pulled.\nBAALA: There’s a line in Mr ausG’s office, but... he’s my friend. He looks after me.\nTURLOUGH: Your “friend” is out there, controlled by the Mara. Come on. This is the only way to save him. Agreed?\nBAALA: (SIGH) Along here.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you.\nTEGAN: Great... I guess that leaves me to try Nyssa. And what a joyride that’1l be.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: 56. STUDIO\nDOCTOR: Not long until midnight, Great One. And the crowds are already gathering out there. Your first appearance in public is keenly anticipated.\nDOCTOR: Not shy, are you?\nDOCTOR: No, of course not. The sooner they learn to fear you, the better. It’s time to rattle this planet out of its self- satisfied torpor. Paradise was never so ripe for the plucking.\nRICK: (SHORT WAY OFF) Lord Mara? May I approach?\nDOCTOR: (MUTTER) We may have given my colleagues position, but it doesn’t mean they’1ll get the power to go with it. (ALOUD) Approach at your own risk, Rick ausGarten.\nRICK: Great Lord Mara, I’ve got my technical crew on standby here. We need to make a few adjustments to the amplification unit housing the Great Crystal. Just a few tweaks...\nRICK: Strewth!\nDOCTOR: Get back, man! Look out!\nRICK: Great Lord, no offence..! (BEAT) What’s it doing?\nDOCTOR: It’s protecting its source. Like a dragon with its horde.\nRICK: We'll never get near the Crystal now. Not with it coiled round like that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 116\nDOCTOR: (THREAT) Don’t try and control the Snake, Rick. It thinks faster than you can. And so do I! Gather the others. We need to agree our plans. After midnight, there’ll be new disciples by the thousand — all of them looking to the Council of the Snake for guidance.\nDOCTOR: 57. RICK’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR: (FX: PHONE RING TONE ON LINE. YOANNA ANSWERS. CROWD IN\nBACKGROUND: )\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Yoanna Rayluss?\nTURLOUGH: Mrs Rayluss? This is Vislor Turlough.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Mr Turlough. I’ve been waiting all day, you know.\nTURLOUGH: I’m sorry.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) You do know what’s going on?\nTURLOUGH: Probably better than you. I’m inside Sundown Studios.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Inside?\nTURLOUGH: Not from choice.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) With the Doctor? And that Snake thing?\nTURLOUGH: Yes.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Is it a hoax... I mean true?\nTURLOUGH: The Snake’s real enough\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) No...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 117\nTURLOUGH: Mrs Rayluss, can you do anything to get the broadcast stopped? Otherwise it’s going to be a disaster.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) But I’m outside now... in the crowd.\nTURLOUGH: Outside?\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) You know what New Year’s like. Safety Squad are already at full stretch — Everyone’s heading this way.\nTURLOUGH: Can you get into the Studio?\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Not likely. Rick ausGarten’s called in the heavy mob to seal the place.\nBAALA: Here, let me. Mrs Rayluss? It’s Baalaka. Round at the back, by the bins, there’s a small door we use to avoid Mr ausG’s fans. I’1ll meet you there.\nYOANNA: (ON PHONE) Right. Okay. Gotcha.\nRICK: Well now.\nBAALA: Mr ausG!\nRICK: Baala and Turlough, playing the innocents.\nTURLOUGH: Ow!\nRICK: You’re the Doctor’s sidekick. Or were. Does he know how to control the Snake? Do you know!?!\nTURLOUGH: Maybe.\nRICK: You'd better remember. Stay out of sight until you do. Meantime I’11l do the honours over meeting the lovely Mrs R. Let’s see how her rules and regulations deal with the Snake.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: 58. WAREHOUSE\nNYSSA: (PETULANT) These governmental books are useless. How can I work from them? (CALLING) And fetch me some decent clothes. I can’t\nNYSSA: possibly attend the Lord Mara’s Presentation dressed like this.\nTEGAN: (NERVOUS) Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Tegan! You look a bit of a state. I thought they’d locked you\nNYSSA: up.\nTEGAN: I got out.\nNYSSA: True to form.\nTEGAN: (CAUTIOUS) How are you? I’m so sorry it happened to you too.\nNYSSA: Taking the Mark? Seeing sense at last, you mean. All that power and time I’ve wasted. I’ve finally realised what a self- righteous little prig I’ve always been. Embarrassing really. (GIGGLE) Still, now it’s all taken a turn for the better.\nTEGAN: Nyssa? Have you been... (drinking)?\nNYSSA: Well, why not? We’ve something to celebrate, haven’t we? And guess what? I think I’ve even found a sense of humour. How about that?\nTEGAN: You always had a sense of humour.\nNYSSA: But I didn’t enjoy it. What a waste. Oh, but I am sorry for you.\nTEGAN: Me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 119\nNYSSA: Missing out on all the fun. Don’t feel too dejected, you poor darling. The Doctor’s furious with you, of course. But he was always such a bully. Either sulking or shouting. (DARKLY) Yes, I think we’ll have to do something about him.\nNYSSA: (WHISPER) Look out! Behind here.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Nyssa! The Lord Mara has ordered a meeting in fifteen minutes... (SUSPICIOUS) What are you doing in here?\nNYSSA: Feeding the birds. Their plumage is fading. (COQUETTISH) Just like mine.\nDOCTOR: You'll find far more attractive clothes in the TARDIS wardrobe. Something red, I think. Or black.\nNYSSA: We'll have to see what I can come up with.\nDOCTOR: Here’s the key.\nNYSSA: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: But don’t bother with the flight controls. I’ve disabled them. (LEAVING) Fifteen minutes, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: You can come out now.\nTEGAN: I thought you’d shop me. What is the Doctor like?\nNYSSA: Poor Tegan. I know you’re jealous.\nTEGAN: What?\nNYSSA: But I was born to power, you see. And if you work hard, I’1l let you be my personal assistant. How would you like that?\nTEGAN: Oh, thank you, Nyssa. I’d... like that very much.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 120\nYOANNA: Come on, Turlough, pick up.\nYOANNA: Oh! Mr ausGarten.. I didn’t expect.. You were ordered to close this studio. Your broadcasts are illegal.\nRICK: You should see the ratings. Come on in, Yoanna. It’s a mad night, tonight.\nYOANNA: What’s going on in there?\nRICK: Be one of the first. Come on.\nYOANNA: No.\nRICK: Or take the Mark now.\nYOANNA: Your arm!\nRICK: Take it.\nYOANNA: No. I don’t believe in cults. They’re the slide that leads to anarchy and chaos.\nRICK: Why worry? It’s all falling down anyway. Forget the past. There’s no future either. There’s just Now. Come on. You know you can’t resist.\nYOANNA: I won’t. I won’t join you.\nRICK: Then stay out in the cold. It’ll get you in the end.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: 60. STUDIO\nDOCTOR: A proclamation from the Snake.\nDOCTOR: We, Regent Protector of Manussa, her lands and colonial worlds, do invite the leaders of those settlements to attend us in council on the home world, where tribute and fealty due to the Lord Mara shall be confirmed and decreed.\nDOCTOR: Long Live the Realm of the Snake!\nDOCTOR: 61. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTURLOUGH: In here, Baala. It’ll be safer in the TARDIS.\nBAALA: This place... It’s a palace. Who dreamt of this?\nTEGAN: Turlough? Oh, that’s a relief. I thought you were the Doctor. Did you speak to Yoanna?\nTURLOUGH: Not exactly. How did you get in? He’s not here, is he?\nTEGAN: I’m with Nyssa. She’s trying on outfits in the wardrobe.\nTURLOUGH: She’s what? Is that safe?\nTEGAN: Not exactly. But she’s hardly a friend of the Doctor’s either. And he’s disabled the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: I thought he might.\nBAALA: It’s nearly midnight. The Snake will soon be presented to the people.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 122\nTEGAN: And they’1l be too scared to resist. It’1ll be a disaster.\nBAALA: The Snake channels its will through the Great Crystal.\nTEGAN: Fat chance of getting near that. The monster’s coiled right round it.\nNYSSA: You can’t stop it.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa? What are you doing?\nTEGAN: You look amazing... Lady Nyssa.\nNYSSA: I’1l take your word for it. My natural modesty makes it hard for me to look at myself. But the Presentation tonight is vital. Manussa needs the strength of the Mara. And I shall be its guiding hand.\nBAALA: That sounds like the Doctor.\nNYSSA: Don’t listen to him. He’s all hot air and bombast. But support me and I shall build a new Empire to the glory of the Mara’s name.\nTEGAN: It’s an honour to serve you, Lady Nyssa.\nTURLOUGH: It is indeed.\nNYSSA: Thank you, my good friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: 62. STUDIO\nDOCTOR: Where’s Nyssa? I told her to be here. Kerrem? Go and fetch her.\nKERREM: I’m not running your errands. Particularly not after that pipsqueak girl. She hasn’t an ounce of my experience. Or of the Dadda’s for that matter.\nDADDA: Oh harsh, Kerrem. She has a certain spiritual tenacity. And an easy appeal to the eye.\nDOCTOR: She has a quicker mind than any of you!\nKERREM: We’ll have to watch that then.\nRICK: Hardly shows respect to our Lord Mara, does it?\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING) Lord Mara, a thousand apologies.\nDADDA: (REACTING TO NYSSA'S ATTIRE) I say.\nNYSSA: I wanted to look my best for the Presentation. And for my fellow councillors.\nKERREM: You put us to shame, my dear.\nDOCTOR: Lord Mara is angry. It demands that the two insurgents, who tried to delay its birth, and anyone associating with them, must be captured and their lives offered in atonement. And I’1l have the key to my ship back too.\nNYSSA: Of course. Tegan and Turlough? Weren’t they your companions once?\nRICK: It’s nearly midnight. We’re due out on the terrace.\nDOCTOR: Lord Mara, your subjects await.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: 63. STUDIO\nTURLOUGH: There they go. The Mara too. Quick, shut the doors.\nBAALA: I’1l do that.\nTEGAN: Where’s all the security gone? The Crystal’s left unguarded.\nBAALA: Mr ausG dismissed them. I saw him.\nTURLOUGH: Really? He’s not so daft, is he?\nTEGAN: So if we get the Crystal away...\nTURLOUGH: . into the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Just what I thought. Maybe we can get the Doctor and Nyssa clear too.\nTURLOUGH: That’1ll take some doing.\nTEGAN: You reckon? Give me a hand with those monitors...\nBAALA: Look at the crystal? Look at the light in its depths.\nTEGAN: Baala? (SOTTO) What is it with him? No family of friends. He doesn’t seem to belong.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think he’s ever been outside these studios.\nTEGAN: You’re joking?\nTURLOUGH: He’s like the birds and snakes in the warehouse. He was born here, out of the crystals.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 125\nBAALA: Someone’s coming.\nTURLOUGH: Yoanna? What’s happened?\nYOANNA: (DISTRESSED) Turlough? Tegan? I was going to stay outside. But I managed to force the door.\nTURLOUGH: Did you see Rick ausGarten? We couldn’t stop him.\nYOANNA: Yes, I saw him. He offered me the Mark of the Snake. I told him no. But the crowds out there are huge. I’ve never seen so many. And they’re all milling and confused. Like cattle to the slaughter.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 126\nDADDA: (ECHOING ON TANNOY) Good people. Before the Great One appears before you, let us reflect on the honour it bestows on us all.\nKERREM: (MUTTER) Get on with it, man.\nDOCTOR: You'll get your turn, Kerrem.\nDADDA: As the old year turns on the wheel of time, the new year brings a new age. The Manussan era ends, the SuMaran era begins. Let us remember the balance of all things.\nDADDA: Night swallows Day\nDADDA: Light follows Dark\nDOCTOR: On the other hand.\nNYSSA: Too much of a good thing.\nDADDA: Desolation drowns Hope Hope conquers Despair. So be it.\nCROWD: So be it.\nRICK: Lord Mara’s getting restless. I’1l announce him.\nDOCTOR: My job, I think, Rick. (ONTO TANNOY) Thank you, Dadda Desaka, for leading our prayers.\nKERREM: Still five minutes to go. Let’s do these things properly.\nRICK: No time like the present.\nNYSSA: No! It’s too soon!\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) Good people, the moment is here. Today the symbol of Manussa’s power comes amongst. Today you shall see its strength.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: 65. STUDIO\nTEGAN: (URGENT) Okay. Screens in a circle. Now help me with the cameras.\nTURLOUGH: Cameras next. Right.\nYOANNA: I think we should get a move on.\nTURLOUGH: What’s that?\nTEGAN: I know that sound.\nBAALA: The crystal. It flared. The Mara’s starting to channel its will!\nYOANNA: We’re too late. It’s beginning! I have to see.\nTURLOUGH: Yoanna!\nTEGAN: I’m gonna get the Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan! Be careful!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 128\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) Today Manussa changes forever.\nCROWD: Get on with it! / We want the Snake!

Whose vision is this place?\nTEGAN: It’s like the place of dreaming on the Kinda world. And that’s where everything started going wrong.\nTURLOUGH: But are you all right?\nNYSSA: Not really, no. Not until the Mara releases my body. I feel... rejected. What am I doing out there in the world?\nTURLOUGH: You don’t want to know.\nTEGAN: It wasn’t you anyway.\nNYSSA: But I can’t go back.\nDADDA: Not until the Balance is restored.\nBAALA: Balance?

Pass it on!\nDOCTOR: Go back to the dark places inside.\nDOCTOR: MARA-DOCTOR\nDOCTOR: MARA-DOCTOR The world’s where I belong!\nDOCTOR: Nowhere’s where you belong!\nDOCTOR: THE LINES REPEAT OVER AND OVER, JOINING TO A CHORUS. THE CAROUSEL CRESCENDOES.... AND DISPERSES.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nDOCTOR WHO: 70. STUDIO\nTEGAN: Did you just dream what I dreamed?\nTURLOUGH: I think so. We’re back.\nBAALA: Page 136\nBAALA: I never dreamed before. Am I dreaming this too?\nTURLOUGH: How can we tell?\nTEGAN: What about the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Tegan? (STRETCHING) I seem to be free. mark. Thank you very much, all of you.\nTEGAN: At last? Really?\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! Are you free too?\nNYSSA: Well, yes. Everyone is... except...\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter?\nNYSSA: The Snake’s still alive.\nTEGAN: It can’t be.\nDOCTOR: Still alive?\nDOCTOR: Look, no more snake The Balance is back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: It’s the Crystal. The link hasn’t been cut!\nTEGAN: It’s coming!\nRICK: Doctor! The Snake demands your allegiance!\nYOANNA: Stand away from the Crystal, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Quick, help me get the Crystal into the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Turlough, give me a hand!\nTURLOUGH: The Mara’s grown too much. It can’t get in!\nBAALA: Ef itdo: ate!\nDOCTOR: Got it?\nRICK: & YOANNA Make way for the Mara!\nBAALA: (HEFTING) Yes!\nTEGAN: Inside quickly!\nTEGAN: (FX: DOOR AND TIMBER SMASH. THE SNAKE CAREERS IN.\nITS: ROAR ENGULFS EVERYTHING)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: 71. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: Shut the doors!\nBAALA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The Mara has swallowed the TARDIS whole!\nTEGAN: Swallowed us?\nBAALA: But it can’t get in, can it?\nDOCTOR: Not short of digesting its way in, no.\nTEGAN: Can’t we just take off?\nDOCTOR: And leave Manussa’s population still in the Mara’s thrall? I don’t think so. Nyssa, hold this.\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Mutualising the crystal lattice into the TARDIS mainframe. That way I can invert its power, reversing its creation. The only problem is... it has to be in physical contact with the snake.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think that’s a good idea.\nNYSSA: Neither do I.\nNYSSA: Give me that!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 139\nTURLOUGH: The Snake must live on!\nTEGAN: Their arms! They’ve still got the Mark of the Snake!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Did you lie to me?\nNYSSA: You’re so gullible, Doctor.\nTURLOUGH: It’s hard to resist.\nDOCTOR: Let go of me!\nTEGAN: Leave him alone!\nTEGAN: What do I do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) The Crystal’s unstable. Be careful!\nTURLOUGH: (MOCKING) Go on, Tegan. Take the Crystal out into the belly of the Snake. I dare you!\nNYSSA: (LAUGHING) She can’t! It’s what keeps her awake at night!\nTEGAN: (DETERMINEDLY CALM) Doctor? I have to save Manussa from the... from the... Mara!\nDOCTOR: No, Tegan!\nTEGAN: Yes, I do. It started with me. I have to end it. Thank you, Doctor, Nyssa, Turlough. Goodbye.\nTURLOUGH: Give me that!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 140\nBAALA: Don’t touch her!\nTEGAN: Baala?\nBAALA: Give it to me, Tegan. I understand now. It’s the Balance. I was created first, you see. I’m the light that casts the Mara’s shadow. It exists because I exist. So it’s up to me to do something about my other half.\nTEGAN: I’m so sorry.\nBAALA: I like to be useful. Goodbye, all of you. Please close the doors behind me.\nTEGAN: Goodbye, Baala.\nTURLOUGH: Stop him!\nNYSSA: Come back!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 141\nDADDA: “In Baala, innocence cancelled out dark knowledge. The Snake turned in on itself, devouring its own tail. And the shackles of the Mara fell like scales from our eyes.” What do you think?\nDOCTOR: Well, I suppose that’s one way of putting it, Dadda.\nDADDA: I’m commissioned for a book.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nDADDA: Goodness knows what the tribe will say. I’m supposed to foretell their future, but this morning it kept coming out all wrong. The signs are better! Imagine that! I could be out of a job.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t worry. Even if Manussa’s old future never happens, I’m sure the New Year will have enough disasters to keep us both happy for ages to come!\nRICK: There they go then. Baala’s birds. Seemed all wrong to keep them caged up.\nDOCTOR: Like all dreams, they fly away. That’1l confuse the ornithologists.\nRICK: Once the market picks up, Doctor, how’s about a spell as a tv presenter? You’re a natural on screen. You pick the subject. I’1ll shoot the series. How’s that?\nDOCTOR: No, no, Rick. Thanks for asking, but I think I’m suddenly going to get a bit of a headache.\nYOANNA: Tegan? How are you feeling?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt Page 142\nTEGAN: Woozy. Light-headed. I’d like to sleep for a week.\nTURLOUGH: Me too.\nNYSSA: It’s the shock, I expect. I feel fine.\nYOANNA: Lucky you. You’re the exception.\nTURLOUGH: (CAUTIOUS) The Mara has gone now, hasn’t it?\nNYSSA: That’s what Tegan usually says.\nTEGAN: And the Doctor always says it’s gone.\nYOANNA: Come on, you lot. The future’s brighter, even if the helplines will be busy for months. The Doctor agrees. He’d make an excellent counsellor, don’t you think? He’s such a good listener.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor?\nTEGAN: That’s a matter of opinion.\nNYSSA: Ahem.\nDOCTOR: I heard that! Tegan? I’m truly sorry. Now we all know how you felt.\nTEGAN: Thanks.\nNYSSA: So has the Mara gone?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. Deep down, it’s in all of us. It always will be.\nTEGAN: Thought so.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE CRADLE OF THE SNAKE by Marc Platt\nYOANNA: Keep busy. That’s my motto. And erm... Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ah...\nYOANNA: I wanted to ask...\nYOANNA: Ugh... we do have posts available...\nDOCTOR: Better answer that, Yoanna. Goodbye. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: on you three, time we were going.\nYOANNA: Doctor! Oh...\nYOANNA: Page 143\nYOANNA: (MUTTER) Come\nYOANNA: Mara helpline. This is Yoanna Rayluss. How can I help you?\nYOANNA: THE END\nDADDA: DESAKA’S “WORDLESS” DIRGE\nDADDA: Night swallows Day,\nDADDA: Day blinds the Night.\nDADDA: Dark follows Light\nDADDA: Light casts the Dark. Desolation drowns Hope,\nDADDA: Hope conquers Despair.\nDADDA: The Poor rob the Rich,\nDADDA: The Rich ignore the Poor. Experience drowns innocence, Innocence was happy."
