Grandpa? I should’ve laid you in a canoe and pushed you out on the current. But you know I can’t do that, ‘cos there's been no river for too many moons. So you gotta wait. I buried you in the ol’ creek bed - hope it ain’t too dusty. Maybe the river’ll come back some day. Then it'll wash you down where the ghosts of the forest spirits are waiting for you. I put flowers where I dug you down... and rocks on top so the dillos can’t dig you up. The guys from the Mission came by in the air jeep again, but I hid in the water tower. Think they want to send me to the city now you’re gone. But someone’s gotta stay. Gotta prove who I am. (LAUGHS) S'‘pose if I do that, they'll say I'm a man. Head of the tribe... Hey, yeah, I gotta...\nROSA: (WHISPERING CLOSE. SHE’S FRIGHTENED) Gotta go, Grandpa. I heard them out beyond the ranch-house. Way off, but I can't stay longer. Like you said, can’t stay here.

How soon before our breath mingles in the twilight under the\nLICHTFUSS: 12\nLICHTFUSS: trees? I await your call.\nILEANA: Anton Lichtfuss. Cut flowers from a would-be cutclaw.\nINEZ: He's very devoted, Senhora.\nILEANA: And that’s all he will be. Yapping round me like an\nILEANA: excited chihuahua. Inez, you'd better put the flowers in water before he arrives and is insulted.\nINEZ: Yes, Senhora.\nINEZ: The bulletins say there’s been another killing.\nILEANA: Another?\nINEZ: On Ipanema beach this time. The Policia blame the wild dogs.\nILEANA: That's the third in as many days. This city starts to smell of death. I knew it was a mistake to come here.\nINEZ: But we always come for Carnaval (Carn-a-val), Senhora.\nILEANA: That was my late husband’s idea. He loved the\nILEANA: crowds and the music. They’ve always set my teeth on edge. I’d go now, but for Victor’s sake.\nINEZ: I thought your son looked better today.\nILEANA: That’s just the day light. It’s the nights that take him the worst. Doctor Hayashi insists there’s some change. But I’m not convinced. I can’t see any change at all. And I don't think those straps will hold him much longer.\nTLEANA: Who's that at this time? Not the chihuahua already?\nINEZ: There’s no one outside, Senhora.\nILEANA: Go and look anyway.\nILEANA: Well? (PAUSE) Inez? (PAUSE) Inez?\nINEZ: (COMING BACK) There’s this... (DISTASTE) package.

THE SUMMIT OF THE CORCOVADO (THE CHRIST STATUE)\nOVERLOOKING: E10.\nOVERLOOKING: INTO THE DISTANCE.\nDOCTOR: Hold still.\nDOCTOR: There you are.\nTOURIST: Thank you. Thanks very much.\nDOCTOR: My pleasure. Have a nice day.\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING) Doctor, that’s the fourth picture you've taken for someone else.\nDOCTOR: People come a long way for this view, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: That's a reason why we came too. Remember?\nDOCTOR: (DEEP, SATISFIED BREATH) Yes... They say the\nDOCTOR: Corcovado Statue is the best place to see Rio. Amazing, isn’t it? And now the smokes of the twenty twenties have lifted... Did you get your moqueca (mokayka)?\nTURLOUGH: The fish and coconut stew? Not exactly.\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nTURLOUGH: I think he saw me coming. He wanted twice the amount you gave me.\nDOCTOR: Actually I think you're supposed to haggle.\nTURLOUGH: He kept going on about ident credit implants. All he’d sell me was this manky-looking burger.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, tomato sauce can hide a multitude of sins.\nTURLOUGH: That’s what I'm banking on. What I really want to see is the Carnaval.\nDOCTOR: It'll be a good three days before it starts in earnest. Can you survive on the loca) cuisine till then?\nTURLOUGH: I might have to spend some time on a hot, sunny Rio beach to compensate.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I think at this date, the beaches may be rather\nDOCTOR: overrun by shanty towns. Displaced indians, overflows from the favelas. That sort of thing.\nTURLOUGH: Not really what I had in mind.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) No, somehow I thought not.\nTURLOUGH: What about you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (CAUGHT OFF GUARD) Me?\nTURLOUGH: Yes, what do you really want?\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m not sure I could really... A lot of things, I suppose.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, come on. How long have you been travelling?\nTURLOUGH: There must be something you've always searched for.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps... (BEAT) But I was once told that I'd know\nDOCTOR: 14\nDOCTOR: when I found it.\nTURLOUGH: And have you?\nDOCTOR: What do you think? (CHEERFULLY CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Still this view is quite spectacular. Last time I was here the statue of Christ wasn't even built.\nTURLOUGE: No?\nDOCTOR: That would have been around seventeen hundred, and the bay down there was full of clippers.\nTURLOUGH: The chief trade being in gold and sugar.\nDOCTOR: And slaves. Like most triumphant enterprises, it had its rotten underbelly. (T'URLOUGH SPLUTTERS)\nTURLOUGH: Ugh! This burger is disgusting. (SPITS)\nDOCTOR: Thad a feeling it might be.\nTURLOUGE: No one can eat this. Ugh. It’s all greasy and gritty.\nTURLOUGE: (CALLS) Here, you.\nTURLOUGH: ‘You mutt. D’you want it? Because I don’t.\nDOCTOR: Turlough, I’m not sure if that’s advisable.\nTURLOUGH: Here you are. Go on.\nTURLOUGH: That's it. At least someone appreciates it. The skinny- looking mongrel was eyeing me up as soon as I bought the burger.\nDOCTOR: Still I don’t think we should encourage him. Where do you want to go now?\nTURLOUGH: Anywhere, Doctor. As long we can get away from it all.\nDOCTOR: CKNOWING) Get away from it, Turlough? Or get away with it?\nTURLOUGH: (GOOD NATURED) Probably a bit of both, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think I’d go along with that. (MOVING AWAY)\nDOCTOR: There’s a parade down there in the city. Shall we take a look? TURLO! S You can see that far? Yes. I'd like that. (REALISES HE'S ALONE) Doctor? Well, wait for me!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 6. ILEANA’S APARTMENT. Victor’s room.\nDOCTOR: (ILEANA AND DR HAYASHI , MIDDLE-AGED AND RATHER PRECISELY VOICED, ARE STRUGGLING WITH VICTOR, ILEANA'S INVALID SON.)\nDOCTOR: ANIMAL IN PAIN.\nILEANA: (STRESSED) Victor, calm down. Quietly, now. We won't hurt you.\nHAYASHI: Senhora, you must hold him still.\nILEANA: I'm trying to! He’s not used to strangers, Hayashi.\nILEANA: (TO HER SON) Victor, it’s alright. Don’t struggle. Mother's here.\nILEANA: There. That’s better. Nothing to be afraid of. Doctor Hayashi's here to help. No one's going to hurt you.\nHAYASHI: Just one jab.\nILEANA: What are you doing, you idiot! (TO VICTOR) It's\nILEANA: 15\nILEANA: alright. Victor. It’s alright.\nHAYASHI: That's better. Administering his medication is proving more dangerous than I anticipated.\nILEANA: (QUIETLY) He’s sleeping again. Next time be more careful with my son. Come through to the lounge. I have to discuss our departure.\nHAYASHI: Senhora, this is ridiculous.\nDOOR: CLOSES.\nILEANA: I mean it, Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: Your son's condition is already critical, if you de- stabilise him further, I may never be able to effect a change in his... nature.\nILEANA: We have to leave Rio.\nHAYASHI: You cannot afford to take him out in public like that.\nILEANA: There is no limit to what I can afford. If necessary your payment can be reviewed.\nHAYASHI: No, no. You misunderstand. My equipment, my assistant... all these are difficult to move.\nILEANA: You brought them here. You can re-establish them elsewhere. It will be quiet. With no distractions.\nILEANA: HAYASHI. But why this sudden change? I must know. Where are you going?\nLICHTFUSS: (ENTERING) Senhora.\nILEANA: Herr Lichtfuss.\nLICHTFUSS: I came immediately. Are you safe?\nILEANA: Yes, yes, Anton. For the moment. Inez is packing. We leave the city at eighteen hundred hours.\nLICHTFUSS: So soon? Tell me what has happened. You've had a warning.\nILEANA: Yes. (AWKWARDLY) But I can’t talk...\nILEANA: HAYASHI. Good afternoon.\nLIGHTFUSS: (SHARP) Who's this...?\nILEANA: Herr Lichtfuss, this is Doctor Matsuo Hayashi.\nLICHTFUSS: The physician that you've acquired to treat Victor.\nHAYASHI: You said “warning”. Does this mean, Senhora, that you have received some sort of threat?\nLICHTFUSS: How much do you understand, doctor?\nHAYASHI: I have the Senhora’s confidence. How else could I attempt to cure her son?\nLICHTFUSS: Cure! That's the last thing we want. Deana, I thought\nLICHTFUSS: you'd abandoned these fantasies.\nILEANA: They are not fantasies. But we must leave Rio now.\nHAYASHI: Have no fear, Senhora. I will not abandon you or your son. Knowing what I know, I can’t imagine you’d ever let me walk free. So, where will we be flying to?\nLICHTFUSS: Flying?\nILEANA: Flying? Whatever gave you that idea?\nILEANA: 16\nILEANA: SCENE 7. MOUNTAIN TRACK\nTURLOUGH: (STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP) Slow down, Doctor. I didn’t think you planned to walk down?\nDOCTOR: I thought you'd enjoy the fresh air.\nTURLOUGH: I thought we had return tickets on the cog-train.\nDOCTOR: Only singles.\nTURLOUGH: Well, shouldn’t we stick to the road at least? Hang on, they don’t do singles.\nDOCTOR: Returns are for tourists.\nTURLOUGH: I thought we were tourists.\nDOCTOR: Really? Yes, I suppose you could look at it like that.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately you spent the last of our tenable currency on that burger.\nTURLOUGH: That dog’s still following us.\nDOCTOR: dust ignore it. It'll soon get bored. You see over to the north east beyond the space ports? That’s where the Amazon rain forest used to be.\nTURLOUGH: Used to be...\nDOCTOR: Up until about twenty years ago.\nTURLOUGH: (INCREDULOUS) You mean they finally burnt it all.\nDOCTOR: They didn't have to. The Amazon was so intensively\nDOCTOR: farmed, its eco-system completely caved-in. The so-called lung of the world turned into a monumental dust bowl. All the unique wildlife - birds, animals, plants - was decimated.\nTURLOUGH: But couldn’t anyone try to stop it? Surely someone...\nDOCTOR: Lots of people. There was nearly a war. But by then the Earth governments had a new toy. The untapped resources of the Moon and the asteroid belt to exploit.\nTURLOUGH: So nobody cared. Humans are so stupid.\nDOCTOR: When you’ve studied humans as long as I have, it’s hard not to find them quite endearing.\nTURLOUGH: I certainly didn’t intend to study them this long.\nDOCTOR: No? Well, I suppose they can get a bit wearing at\nDOCTOR: times. All those questions. And they never seem to learn from their mistakes.\nTURLOUGH: That dog's still behind us.\nDOCTOR: CKEEPING GOING) I know. And a couple more have tagged along.\nTURLOUGH: And more to the right.\nDOCTOR: Just keep walking. Don’t run.\nTURLOUGH: It's turning into a pack. What do they want? They’re after food.\nTURLOUGH: I haven't got any more food.\nTURLOUGH: I don't think they’re that fussy, Turlough. If we can just get to the road...\nRX: A DOG BOUNDS CLOSE AND SNAPS AT THEM.\nRX: 7\nTURLOUGH: Look out!\nTURLOUGH: Are you hurt?\nDOCTOR: Just a little demoralised. They’re trying to drive us into a dead end. Look out!\nDOCTOR: TURLOUGH.\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: I never liked this jacket anyway. What do we do?\nDOCTOR: Try to divert them. There’s an old story about throwing the baby out of the sledge to stop the pursuing wolves.\nTURLOUGH: I threw them a burger, Doctor, and that only brought more of them.\nDOCTOR: Then give me a hand with this branch.\nDOCTOR: We'll have to fight our way out as best we can.\nTURLOUGH: The wood’s tinder dry.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. I don’t suppose you’ve got any matches.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry.\nDOCTOR: (GOING THROUGH POCKETS) Now where did I put\nDOCTOR: that magnifying glass?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? I don't think there’s time for that.\nDOCTOR: (RESIGNED) Alright. Keep your back to the bushes and stay close to me. That way they’ve only got one line of attack. Try to tackle one at a time...\nDOCTOR: Ready, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Ready, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Here they come,\nTURLOUGH: What’s that?\nTURLOUGH: They’re going.\nDOCTOR: Come on!\nTURLOUGH: What happened? Where did they go?\nDOCTOR: We're not staying to find out. Come on.\nTURLOUGE: Something frightened them off.\nDOCTOR: There’s the road. You were right. We should never have left it.\nTURLOUGH: But they just ran.\nDOCTOR: Just keep going or we’ll miss that parade.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t tell me then. I don’t want to know anyway.\nDOCTOR: No, Turlough. I don’t think you do. Come on!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8. ILEANA’S APARTMENT\nDOCTOR: 18\nILEANA: Anton, did you hear?\nLICHTFUSS: Right across the city. It’s another warning. He’s marking out his territory.\nILEANA: The Grey One. So many years since I heard that voice, I hoped it might be never again. I was praying it might be just the wind howling in the trees\nLIGHTFUSS: You're cold.\nTLEANA.: It chills me.\nLICHTFUSS: Poor Ileana.\nTLEANA: I thought the ocean might be a barrier to him. How\nTLEANA: long have I tried to deny all that darkness, knowing it would always return? Slinking in, the way the moonlight always finds a crack in the shutters.\nLICHTFUSS: He must get past me first.\nTLEANA: No. We can't make a stand against him. Who knows how powerful he’s grown?\nLICHTFUSS: I shall challenge him. Most powerful or not...\nILEANA: Don’t be a fool. You don’t know him.\nLICHTFUSS: But I will.\nILEANA: (BEAT) I was afraid Victor would wake. Above all else, I have to protect him. That's why we must get out of Rio now.\nLICHTFUSS: With that cutclaw doctor? Is your son really so ill?\nTLEANA: There’s no change. Why doesn’t he change? (BEAT)\nTLEANA: Until Hayashi came I thought everything was lost. But he’s an expert.\nLICHTFUSS: A meddler.\nILEANA: He has to be trusted. And we can’t stay here. Where's Inez?\nLICHTFUSS: We can't run forever, Ileana. The others won't follow.\nILEANA: They'll do as I tell them. Even you, Lichtfuss. For all\nILEANA: the attentions you pay me, you must accept that the old world has changed. I won't sway my decision for anyone. I’m still the leader. And my word is still our law.\nILEANA: SCENE 9. STREET IN RIO.\nILEANA: DRUMS, WHISTLES.\nILEANA: (THE DOCTOR & TURLOUGH, JOSTLED BY THE CROWD, BOTH MUCH\nMORE: JOVIAL, AND RAISING THEIR VOICES TO HEAR EACH OTHER.)\nTURLOUGH: Doctor! Over here! You can get a better view.\nDOCTOR: (PUSHING THROUGH) Excuse me. Can I just...? 'ma Doctor. Can I get through please? Thank you. (A CARIOCAN YELP.) Sorry.\nTURLOUGH: Look at those bird and animal masks. Some of them are almost alive.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. (BEAT) So is this what you had in mind?\nTURLOUGH: Much more like it.\nDOCTOR: And the business with the dogs...? I apologise...\nTURLOUGH: It’s alright. Don't worry. Look at the dancers now! And this isn’t even real Carnaval yet.\nDOCTOR: Glad you Like it.\nTURLOUGH: Ido, Thank you, Doctor. (THOUGHTS IN A SPIN)\nTURLOUGH: 19\nTURLOUGH: Look! Look at the colours on that seashell outfit! Is it all made of flowers? The whole thing must be twenty foot across.\nDOCTOR: No, not really. It’s amazing what they can do with computer graphics these days.\nTURLOUGH: (NUDGE, NUDGE) It’s amazing how little they can cover with so much\nDOCTOR: Atavistic expressions of the inner human self...\nTURLOUGH: I'd call it downright revealing.\nDOCTOR: Positively bacchanalian. But what do you expect from\nDOCTOR: a population that spends the rest of the year hunched over computer screens?\nDOCTOR: And a happy Shrovetide to you too!\nTURLOUGH: (LAUGHING) Or maybe humans are just plain Earthy.\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST LAUGHING) Yes. Yes, indeed. But preferable, I'm sure, to the straight-laced rigours of public school.\nTURLOUGH: Never again, Doctor. Now this is when you see what humans are really like.\nDOCTOR: Oh, please, not too philosophical, Turlough. Not today.\nDOCTOR: (NOTICES A CONVENIENT DISTRACTION) Ah... Good heavens, I’m not entirely sure how that stays up.\nTURLOUGH: Skill, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Or art...\nTURLOUGH: Yes. But I wouldn’t stare quite so much if 1 were you.\nDOCTOR: Re\nSAMBA GIRL: Aye. You want to dance?\nSAMBA GIRL: Gomme on, let’s dance.\nDOCTOR: Er... no, really. Thank you.\nSAMBA GIRL: Yes. Let’s dance. Do the samba.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s very kind of you...not just now, really...\nSAMBA GIRL: Everybody dances at Carnaval. Come on. Dance with me. I show you how.\nDOCTOR: No, erm thank you... please, no.\nTURLOUGH: Go on, Doctor! Get in there!\nSAMBA GIRL: (CLAPPING HER HANDS) Yes. We samba all the way to the Sugarloaf and back again.\nDOCTOR: No. Please let go. I’m sorry, I’m saving myself for the big day. Another ee perhaps...\nTURLOUGH: Dent be such a coward, Doctor. You can.... (HE\nTURLOUGH: STUITERS AND SHIVERS.)\nCAR: IS HEARD SLOWLY APPROACHING.\nDOCTOR: Turlough? What's the matter?\nDOCTOR: TusLove™: (WITH DIFFICULTY, AS IF HE’S FREEZING) What is it’?\nDOCTOR: Don’t move. Something’s coming through the crowd.\nTURLOUGH: I must... get back. .\nTURLOUGH: 20\nDOCTOR: No, no, don’t go with the crowd. Turlough, listen to me.\nTURLOUGH: We have to move. Have to let it through.\nTURLOUGH: THE DISTANCE.\nDOCTOR: Turlough? Listen. I have to follow that car.\nDOCTOR: Just stay here. I'll be back.\nTURLOUGH: (MUMBLING) Don’t go, Doctor. Wait for me. (HE\nSHUDDERS: AGAIN)\nTURLOUGH: Something else coming. Who’s that?\nTURLOUGH: WOLF.\nTURLOUGH: Those eyes. Black and gold. Don't look. Don’t look.\nTURLOUGH: CHARDLY DARING TO ASK) Who are you? (BEAT) Don't look at me like that.\nSTUBBE: Good day to you, young stranger. What fierce eyes you have.\nTURLOUGH: Like you then, aren't I.\nTURLOUGH: What do you want?\nSTUBBE: Got any food for a hungry wanderer? (BEAT) No?\nSTUBBE: Perhaps 1 was wrong. I was told there was a young fellow with food to throw away. A hunter, I thought. But you have the lean, hungry look of @ common jackal.\nTURLOUGH: (SWALLOWS) Leave me alone.\nSTUBBE: For the moment. There was a forest here once, but the cutclaws tore it down and set us wolves\nTURLOUGH: (SARCASTIC) Oh yes, of course they did.\nSTUBBE: And we run fast, young stranger.\nTURLOUGH: Ive seen better wolf masks in third rate horror films.\nSTUBBE: Once we have a scent, we never lose it. Don’t stray\nSTUBBE: too far from the path. Because I’ll be waiting.\nTURLOUGH: (EXHAUSTED) Doctor, where the hell have you gone?\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Turlough! There you are. (ON AN\nEXCITABLE: TRAIN OF THOUGHT) That hover limo. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, to let it through.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) I don’t... really remember...\nDOCTOR: Interesting. Probably couldn't help yourself. Could have been some sort of mass auto suggestion. Even a basic mstinctive fear, driving you back. You look cold.\nTURLOUGH: Yes.\nDOCTOR: You've dropped your jacket.\nTUBLOUGH: Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Couldn't see who was inside the car though. The\nDOCTOR: windows were polarised. I wonder why it was pushing through the erowd when all the traffic lanes are thirty feet overhead? Mind you, if\nDOCTOR: 21\nDOCTOR: it’s moving at ground level that makes it easier to follow. (SUDDENLY NOTICES.) Turlough? You do look very cold.\nTURLOUGH: (RALLYING A LITTLE) Something else came through. After you'd gone. ;\nDOCTOR: I didn't see anything. Was it following the car?\nTURLOUGH: It came right up to me.\nDOCTOR: Really. ;\nTURLOUGH: It kept growling. And it was tall... with a mask like a\nTURLOUGH: wolf and burning gold eyes. (WISHES HE HADN’T THOUGHT THIS) At least I think it was a mask.\nDOCTOR: Did you speak to it?\nTURLOUGH: (SHARP) No.\nDOCTOR: Pity. (BEAT) That car was heading for the old Dom Pedro station.\nTURLOUGH: Where we left the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Nasty thoughts are like buses, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Mmm?\nDOCTOR: You don’t see one for ages and then a whole army come along together. Come on!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10. ESTACAO DOM PEDRO CONCOURSE\nDOCTOR: (JORGE, WHO IS OLDER, MEETS ILEANA AND HER PARTY — LICHTFUSS, INEZ & HAYASHI)\nJORGE: (APPROACHING) Senhora. I was starting to worry.\nILEANA: The Carnaval crowds delayed us, Jorge, but they may help muddy our tracks. Where’s the train?\nJORGE: It's all prepared and programmed. Inez. Herr\nJORGE: Lichtfuss. Are we all here?\nILEANA: If we stand about, we'll attract attention. We must keep my son out of sight.\nLICHTFUSS: He’s still sleeping. Jorge, help us with the hover- gurney.\nJORGE: (A DEEP GRUMBLING GROWL OF DISTASTE) Are these the physicians?\nILEANA: Doctor Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: And this is my assistant, Juro.\nILEANA: They come with us. I told you this already.\nJORGE: (COLD) This way, Senhora.\nJORGE: Inez, where's Kanu Choudhry? I thought he’d meet us.\nINEZ: (UNCOMFORTABLE) Mr Choudhry is not coming.\nLIGHTFUSS: You didn’t tel me that. (TO ILEANA) Senhora? Has he finally slunk away, tail between his legs?\nILEANA: It’s something I'll explain to you later.\nLICHTFUSS: (SNEERS) Not in front of the cutclaws..\nILEANA: Never say that again, Lichtfuss! Never ever! Any\nILEANA: more whining and I’ll..\nILEANA: 22\nJORGE: What’s that? (DEHP BREATH) Do you catch it?\nINEZ: (BREATH) What is it?\nINEZ: (THEY’VE CAUGHT A SCENT WHICH SENDS THEM INTO A BIZARRE AND SLOW REVERIE - THE MUSIC COULD EMPHASISE THIS.)\nINEZ: JORGE. It’s like nothing I’ve ever...\nILEANA: Ancient... a scent like... stillness.\nLICHTFUSS: Like coming snow...\nJORGE: No, no. Like breaking ice on the rivers in spring.\nILEANA: The scent after the lightning before the thunder.\nINEZ: Or fields after rain.\nILEANA: And the oldest forests. Under the dark fir trees...\nLICHTFUSS: (ANGRY GROWL) Almost... unearthly... HAYASHI. (URGENT) Senhora. Senhora, we should move.\nILEANA: What? What is it, Hayashi?\nHAYASHI: We are being watched. The train. Please. Hurry.\nHAYASHI: SCENE 11. THE SAME (ESTACAO DOM PEDRO CONCOURSE)\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Turlough, they’re moving again.\nTURLOUGH: I thought they’d seen us for a minute. At least they’re nowhere near the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: That’s true. Can you see them better now?\nTURLOUGH: Sort of. But it’s hard to focus. My brain knows they're there because you tell me, but it’s a job to convince my eyes.\nDOCTOR: Because they don’t want to be seen.\nTURLOUGH: It don’t want to see them either. I thought fur coats like that would have been outlawed years ago.\nDOCTOR: They're heading the gurney towards that monorail.\nTURLOUGH: You said only freight travels by train these days.\nDOCTOR: Or livestock. Maybe I was wrong. (MOVING OFF) If that’s a body they're pushing, maybe I should pay my respects.\nTURLOUGH: Oh. no, Doctor. Come back. Not through there.\nTANNOY: Alert. You have breached security barrier seven. Stay\nTANNOY: where you are. (CONTINUES UNDER) Have your passports and identity implants ready for inspection.\nDOCTOR: Aha. So that's it.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Look at the crest on the side of the carriage.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, we can’t stay here.\nDOCTOR: Familio de Santos. Just like royaity. Fancy a trip on a royal train, Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, it’s not our business. Maybe it’s a private funeral.\nDOCTOR: One that clears the streets by auto suggestion? With something nasty like a hungry wolf following the cortege?\nTURLOUGH: It was just a mask... part of the Carnaval.\nDOCTOR: Now you're trying to delude yourself. Which is\nDOCTOR: exactly what they want. (URGENT) Come on. (MOVING OFF) We've a train to catch.\nDOCTOR: 23,\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12. STATION PLATFORM\nTANNOY: Remain where you are on platform seven. Passports and identity implants must be shown to the immigration inspection module.\nINEZ: (CUTTING OVER LAST SPEECH) Senhora, come inside. The train is ready to leave.\nILEANA: That scent again, Inez. There he is.\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) Hello!\nINEZ: Senhora, the doors. Quickly.\nTRAIN: INTERIOR.\nILEANA: How strange.\nINEZ: Come away from the window, Senhora. We must attend your son. Senhora?\nINEZ: SCENE 15. STATION PLATFORM\nTURLOUGH: What’s she staring at?\nDOCTOR: Me, I think. (BEAT. THEN LOUDLY) Please, I must speak to you.\nDOCTOR: (GESTICULATING) Look. I am the Doctor and this is...\nTURLOUGH: Too late.\nDOCTOR: I have to speak to her.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Here comes trouble.\nTURLOUGH: (ALTHOUGH IT HAS THE SAME VOICE AS THE ECHOING TANNOY, THE\nINSPECTOR: SOUNDS LIKE A POLITE AND RATHER ORDINARY AIRLINE\nHOSTESS: - NOT THE CLICHED LEMON-SOAKED NAPKINS VARIETY.)\nINSPECTOR: Your passports please, senhors.\nTANNOY: Display your passports and identity grafts to the immigration inspection module now.\nDOCTOR: This train. Where’s it going?\nINSPECTOR: You are in a restricted area. If you have no passport, please display your state identity grafts now.\nDOCTOR: I want to know about that train.\nINSPECTOR: Under Amazonian State law, it is an offence not to display your ID implant within the city boundaries.\nTURLOUGH: Not listening.\nINSPECTOR: Please display your genome ID grafts, senhors.\nINSPECTOR: Failure to do so may result in a fine or imprisonment.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Do your limited responses include a timetable? Or was that train a specially chartered service?\nINSPECTOR: If you have a personal credit-rating code recognised. by any major international bank, please display now.\nTURLOUGH: I think it wants a bribe.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s out of luck.\nDOCTOR: 24\nDOCTOR: Agh. That’s my arm you're twisting off!\nINSPECTOR: A credit rating of nil is also an offence within the city central boundaries.\nTURLOUGH: Hold still, Doctor. If I can prise that open... DOCTOR. Overgrown shopping trolley!\nINSPECTOR: Under Amazonian State law, assaulting an inspecting officer is a punishable offence.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, shut up.\nTURLOUGH: Ow! Get off, me!\nINSPECTOR: Fines for not displaying an ID may not be less than\nINSPECTOR: five thousand credits or a prison term of no less than six months. Please accompany me to the Immigration Register Office immediately.\nTANNOY: Emergency procedures. Assistance is required on platform seven. Two illegal immigrants are resisting arrest.\nTURLOUGH: I can’t get free!\nTURLOUGH: BURBLES OF PROTEST.\nTANNOY: Emergency! Assistance required on platform seven.\nDOCTOR: There it goes.\nTURLOUGH: Ow, my arm. What was it? I didn't see. It was so fast.\nDOCTOR: A huge wolf.\nTURLOUGH: CUNNERVED) A wolf?\nDOCTOR: Yes. A massive grey animal. Bounding after the monorail.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, we can't stay here.\nDOCTOR: No. We have to warn them. Back to the TARDIS\nDOCTOR: quickly. There’s more than one way to catch a train.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 14. TRAIN INTERIOR - ILEANA’S APARTMENT.\nHAYASHI: Your son is growing weaker, Senhora.\nILEANA: By that, I assume that you mean his dark side is growing stronger.\nHAYASHI: Until we reach our destination, wherever that is, I\nHAYASHI: must increase the dosage of inhibitor drugs. If only for our own safety.\nILEANA: I want a cure, Hayashi. Not a delay.\nHAYASHI: Impossible until I have proper medical facilities. To treat your son was my own caleulated risk, but now both my assistant and I are endangered by circumstances beyond our control.\nILEANA: There is no danger. Just concentrate on a cure for my son.\nLICHTFUSS: No danger, Neana? Then who was the stranger at the station?\nILEANA: This is my private carriage, Herr Lichtfuss. What do\nILEANA: you all want?\nILEANA: 25\nINEZ: We are all concerned, Senhora.\nJORGE: Who was that at the station? Was it Him?\nILEANA: (SARCASTIC) You think that was the Grey One, Jorge? Did he look grey?\nLICHTFUSS: Then who was it?\nINEZ: Perhaps you have a rival, mein herr.\nILEANA: He was a stranger, that’s all. I've never seen him before.\nJORGE: But he saw us, Senhora.\nLICHTFUSS: Is he a rival? If he is, Ileana, I'll lay his skin at your feet.\nINEZ: (MOCKING) Such gallantry.\nJORGE: (JOINING IN) We'll turn the train round for you now.\nILEANA: Be quiet, all of you. Doctor Hayashi, please forgive us. You are our guest.\nHAYASHI: But I’m eager to learn your ways, Senhora.\nLICHTFUSS: One stranger after another.\nILEANA: The stranger at the station means nothing. Get that into your head. He was just an inquisitive cutclaw.\nLICHTFUSS: He didn’t smell like nothing.\nILEANA: (ANGRY) God! Why is everyone always so young!\nILEANA: You're always questioning me. Always snapping at my heels. If you don’t believe the danger we left, then I'll show you. Maybe that’ll put a stop to your whining.\nILEANA: SCENE 15. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nDOCTOR: How’s your shoulder?\nTURLOUGH: It hurts. How about yours?\nDOCTOR: Still workable. Next time I'll buy a platform ticket.\nTURLOUGH: At the risk of sounding human...\nDOCTOR: A question about what happened? Yes, of course.\nTURLOUGH: The wolf you saw.\nDOCTOR: Wolf- like.\nTURLOUGH: But with golden eyes?\nDOCTOR: Difficult to say. It was moving so fast. And it wasn’t standing on its hindlegs.\nTURLOUGH: Mine was.\nDOCTOR: I thought it might have been.\nSEQUENCE: STARTS.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, no. You're not going after it. What about the Carnaval?\nDOCTOR: Those people are in danger, Turlough. And if I can’t\nDOCTOR: catch a train, I can always go ahead and meet it.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 16. TRAIN INTERIOR - ILEANA’S APARTMENT.\nDOCTOR: ILEANA, LICHTFUSS, JORGE AND HAYASHI WAIT AS INEZ BRINGS IN THE BOX THAT WAS DELIVERED TO ILEANA'S APARTMENT.)\nDOCTOR: 26\nILEANA: (GRAVE) Put the box down here, Inez. Then they can all see why we had to leave.\nPX: BOX PUT ON A TABLE. RUSTLE OF POLYTHENE WRAPPER.\nILEANA: This gift was delivered to my apartment this morning.\nJORGE: There’s blood on it.\nLICHTFUSS: (STERN) Tleana, your physician is still here.\nHAYASHI: Forgive me, Senhora, I’m intruding.\nILEANA: Stay here, Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: I must attend to your son.\nLICHTFUSS: Excellent idea.\nILEANA: And I want you to stay! We don’t have secrets from you. How can we? Whatever Herr Lichtfuss thinks.\nLICHTFUSS: It's no secret what I think.\nJORGE: This biood. (SNIFFS) It’s a day old at least. But I can’t place the smell.\nLICHTFUSS: Jorge, let me see.\nLICHTFUSS: There's a card.\nILEANA: The Grey One sends gifts as well. Open it, Anton.\nGREETINGS CARD VOICE: Thank you for reading this paperfree card. No trees were harmed in the making of this product. Your greeting reads:\nSTUBBE: “A gift to the merchant’s daughter. How many fat moons since I pulled you from the snow?”\nLICHTFUSS: Is that him?\nTLEANA: Who else. It's why we left Rio. Open the box.\nTLEANA: (LICHTFUSS DRAWS HIS BREATH SHARPLY THROUGH HIS THETH.\nJORGE: GASPS.)\nJORGE: Kanu Chowdhry!\nLICHTFUSS: (SLOW, ANGRY) His head.\nSTUBBE: “And when the moon is fat again, I shal wrap you in its silver sheen and blood will feed the forest.”\nLICHTFUSS: (JEALOUS) What does he mean?\nILEANA: This is why I took you away from the city. It's why I've called a council\nJORGE: You've called the others?\nILEANA: AS many as would listen.\nLICHTFUSS: No one’s done that ever.\nILEANA: There's never been a threat like this till now.\nHAYASHI: Senhora, the head. May I see please?\nLICHTFUSS: Don’t touch that!\nILEANA: Let him see.\nILEANA: FX; MORE RUSTLED POLYTHENE.\nILEANA: HAYASHI. (ANALYTICAL) Hmm. Yes. Very ferocious. I think you were wise to leave when you did.\nLICHTFUSS: Before we all have our heads torn off?\nHAYASHI: No, not torn. There’s a lot of blood clogged in his fur,\nHAYASHI: but the actual severance is comparatively clean. You'd need very\nHAYASHI: ae\nHAYASHI: powerful jaws to take the head off like that. Just one bite, I think.\nLICHTFUSS: Monster!\nLICHTFUSS: ILEANA. Stop it! Lichtfuss, let him go!\nILEANA: Don't answer that!\nJORGE: But it could be the others. Waiting for us.\nILEANA: No. Look at the screen. That caller ID. Don’t touch it.\nILEANA: Don’t touch it!\nILEANA: SCENE 17. TARDIS INTERIOR\nDOCTOR: Now, at an average speed of four hundred and two point three five kph...\nDOCTOR: It should reach these coordinates in about four and a quarter minutes... or 80.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, where are we?\nDOCTOR: We'll just hover here for a while.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t answer my question then.\nDOCTOR: Coordinates ... 51 degrees West by 16 degrees South.\nDOCTOR: The northern end of the Mantiqueira Tunnel. Otherwise known as the lower regions of the Amazon Desert, And from the look of it, a pretty dismal and dusty place it is too.\nTURLOUGH: And have you got the year right?\nDOCTOR: No need to be sarcastic.\nTURLOUGH: We're on the monorail track!\nDOCTOR: Three inches above it, to be precise. As I said, we’re in hover mode. I just hope it’s the north-bound track.\nTURLOUGH: I don't believe this. You're waiting for that train.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. And allowing for any leaves on the line,\nDOCTOR: which is doubtful in this ecologically catastrophic day and age, it’s due any time now. I hope we’re not too late.\nTURLOUGH: You're crazy. You've put us right in its path.\nDOCTOR: As I say, 'm getting rather better at these precision manoeuvres.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. There are lights...\nDOCTOR: Good, good. Now when the train comes through, I simply jump the TARDIS forward ten seconds in time..\nTURLOUGH: It's coming! Doctor! The train!\nDOCTOR: ...but not in space!\nTURLOUGH: DOCTOR!!!\nLURCHING: SCREECH. ALMIGHTY CRASH.\nCLOSING: MUSIC.\nCLOSING: NOTE: SCENE 18 DELETED FROM PART 1\nCLOSING: 28"

(SHIVERS) Still two nights to full moon, grandpa. Future won't be long now. That's what I heard on the path. So I’m just staying put. Future’ll find me when it’s hungry. I’m ready.

You're definitely getting better at these short jumps.\nDOCTOR: Yes, as leapfrog manoeuvres go, that was rather nifty. Even if I say so myself.\nTURLOUGH: And hardly any damage to the TARDIS at all.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (TAKING IN THE SURROUNDINGS) Baggage.\nTURLOUGH: I'm sorry?\nTURLOUGH: DOCTOR. It’s a baggage car, Turlough. Albeit an empty one.\nTURLOUGH: Very impressive. (BEAT) Quiet, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I just hope we’re not too late.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21.

There's a lot to prepare at\nILEANA: the ranch. Inez, he says the others are already arriving.\nINEZ: So soon?\nILEANA: Yes. Oh, don’t look so despondent. This is extraordinary. Some of them are legends. Irnst Boxen of Morbach walked in out of the desert at noon. Followed by Selina of Greifswald.\nINEZ: Selina? Heavens, however old must she be?\nILEANA: And the Misters Maugrim and Talbot. And Billy Redtooth of the Cherokee.\nINEZ: Senhora, is this wise?\nILEANA: It's certainly dangerous. But I've considered it long\nILEANA: enough. Isn't that what people do? Consider things. That has to be better than blind instinct. And so many lost souls have answered my call already.\nINEZ: Are they lost? You may have to convince them of that.\nILEANA: If they can come so soon...\nINEZ: Then so can the Grey One, Senhora.\nTLEANA: That's why we left Rio. Jorge says we'll reach the old\nTLEANA: cattle station within three hours. And Tino will be there to meet us. We can't turn back now.\nHAYASHI: (DISTRAUGHT) Let go of met\nLICHTFUSS: Get back, cutclaw.\nHAYASHI: Let me through! Senhora, I must see you.\nILEANA: What this?\nHAYASHI: He’s dead.

Do you catch it?\nILEANA: That scent again. The one we caught at the station.\nLICHTFUSS: What is that?\nINEZ: It smells like... No, that's absurd. You remember the fields at Antwerp, where they harvested the white celery?\nLICHTFUSS: That stranger...\nTLEANA: (SHARP) No. Not him. It’s the Grey One. He’s with us\nTLEANA: Here on the train.

(WHISPER) What was that?\nDOCTOR: With luck, just a restless cheese and tomato roll.\nTURLOUGEH: This is the food galley. Not very sanitary, is it?\nDOCTOR: No. And someone's left the meat store open. How very careless... (GEES SOMETHING NASTY) Ah...\nTUBLOUGH: What is it?\nDOCTOR: No, Turlough. That's not a good idea.\nTURLOUGEH: Why? What's going... Oh, no.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Horrible. His face.\nDOCTOR: (RESONANCE CHANGES AS HE WALKS INSIDE) Yes. It’s a shock.\nTURLOUGH: I should be used to... I mean, I’ve seen things... but hung up there...\nDOCTOR: I know.\nTURLOUGH: With the other meat.\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINING THE CORPSE) The ambient temperature\nDOCTOR: of this store must be about three degrees celsius. But he’s still warm. So it’s a recent death.\nTUBLOUGH: I can tell that by the blood. Is this the body they were Sarre at the station?\nDOCTOR: Hard to tell. He's of Asian origin. Nasty jagged wounds. More like teeth marks.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor?\nTURLOUGH: 31\nDOCTOR: Probably caused by some sort of large carnivore.\nTURLOUGH: In the corner, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, yes indeed. Quite like that.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t touch it.\nDOCTOR: The severed head of a wolf. No, not quite a wolf. Bigger. Less vulpine, more..\nTURLOUGH: Man like? His eyes are blue. What’s it doing in a box? Looks as if it’s been gift-wrapped.\nDOCTOR: Was this what you saw at the Carnaval?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know. What did you see at the station? (BEAT) Maybe we are too late. Maybe they’ve caught the killer already.\nDOCTOR: No blood on its jaws. And it’s cold. It's been dead a\nDOCTOR: couple of days at least. Look at the neck. That wasn't severed neatly. The whole head’s been bitten off.\nTURLOUGH: By something bigger?\nDOCTOR: (CAUTIOUS) Turlough, don’t move.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: Don’t be surprised, but we are not alone. (BRIGHTLY) How do you do? I’m the Doctor...\nTURLOUGH: Where? There’s no one here.\nDOCTOR: (LESS OPTIMISTIC)...and this is Turlough.\nLIGHTFUSS: Another bloody doctor, Jorge.\nJORGE: Two lambs who strayed from the flock, Herr Lichtfuss.\nLICHTFUSS: And this is not the way back to the sheepfold.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me.\nTURLOUGH: (HALF LAUGHING) Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (TESTILY) Being polite. They’re right in front of you. Can you really not see them?\nTURLOUGE: Who?\nDOCTOR: Then just stay still. Don’t move.\nDOCTOR: (JORGE AND LICHTFUSS ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING ROUND THE DOCTOR AND TURLOUGH)\nJORGE: (SNIFFS) You see? Celery. Inez was right. But all mixed up with... some sort... no, several sorts of musk. Like nothing I've ever caught before. Reminds me of places I’ve never heard of.\nLICHTFUSS: (ALSO SNIFFING) He’s no Grey One.\nDOCTOR: Please take your hand off my coat. Ow! No need to be vicious.\nJORGE: He’s no cutclaw either. Neither’s the other one.\nTURLOUGH: (BORED) Well, sorry Doctor, but I can’t see anyone.\nDOCTOR: Neither of them?\nTURLOCUGH: Neither? How many of them are there?\nJORGE: (SNIFFING) This one smells of... cooked meat. Horse meat? Maybe goat. But very old at any rate.\nDOCTOR: Leave my friend alone, please. Turlough, they're\nDOCTOR: playing with your perception. Just listen to me.\nLICHTFUSS: . The young one’s more susceptible. What shall we do with him? Drive him off the train?\nDOCTOR: I said, leave my friend alone. And let go of me!\nJORGE: (TO TURLOUGH'S LEFT) RRRRRRRuff!\nTURLOUGH: Agh! What is it? Who's there?\nTURLOUGH: 32\nDOCTOR: Leave him alone. Turlough! I’m here!\nJORGE: (TO TURLOUGH’S RIGHT) RRRuff. Go back!\nDOCTOR: Look at me, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: T can’t see you.\nDOCTOR: Then listen. I’m over here.\nTURLOUGH: Where? It’s all foggy. Doctor, where are you? I can’t see anyone!\nCLICHTFUSS: STARTS TO LAUGH)\nDOCTOR: Don't try to look. Shut your eyes.\nJORGE: (TO TURLOUGH’S LEFT) Go this way.\nTURLOUGH: No!\nJORGE: RRuff RRRuff. (INSTANT MOVE TO TURLOUGH’S RIGHT) Go that. (CONTINUES RRUFFING ETC)\nTURLOUGH: No. Please! I can’t stop myself.\nDOCTOR: Shut your eyes and reach straight in front of you, Turlough. No, not that way!\nLICHTFUSS: Yes, that way.\nJORGE: RRuff. RRuff. Straight for the door.\nJORGE: COUNTRYSIDE. A DOOR ALARM SOUNDS.\nDOCTOR: Turlough! Crouch down! Then you can’t move.\nTURLOUGH: . I must get away!\nJORGE: Go on! Jump!\nDOCTOR: Turlough, no!\nLICHTFUSS: It’s him! There he is!\nJORGE: What?\nLICHTFUSS: He's there! Along there. I saw him! (HURRYING\nLICHTFUSS: AWAY) Leave these two.\nLICHTFUSS: ROW FROM OUTSIDE. THE ALARM STOPS.\nDOCTOR: Turlough. Turlough, can you see me?\nTURLOUGH: (WOOZY) Yes.\nDOCTOR: dust go gently.\nTURLOUGH: Think you were right about auto suggestion. Didn't\nTURLOUGH: have a thought in my head that was mine. Did I nearly jump off the train?\nDOCTOR: Very nearly, yes.\nTURLOUGH: Did you stop me?\nDOCTOR: No, no, Turlough, I couldn’t. They were putting the\nDOCTOR: idea, in your head. Fortunately they found something else more important to chase.\nINEZ: They'll forget a fat sheep to go and chase a skinny Tat.\nDOCTOR: Boa noite (noyti), senhorita.\nINEZ: Good evening, senhor. When their blood’s up, a\nINEZ: common flea could out-think them.\nBOCTOR: Making people jump seems to be a habit round here.\nBOCTOR: 33\nBOCTOR: I'm the Doctor and this is Turlough.\nINEZ: Were you hurt?\nDOCTOR: How considerate. Turlough? Are you hurt?\nTURLOUGH: Only scarred mentally. Nothing that'll show.\nINEZ: Senhor, my mistress wants to speak with you.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. No doubt she’s travelling First Class. With\nDOCTOR: none of the annoying disadvantages that lesser passengers in Steerage have to suffer.\nINEZ: She is waiting.\nINEZ: SCENE 24. TRAIN CARRIAGE\nSLIDES: OPEN.\nLICHTFUSS: Not a whiff of the Grey One, Jorge. No spoor, no fumet.\nJORGE: Even he couldn’t get far. Not if he’s just eaten.\nLICHTFUSS: That was Victor that we saw, not the Grey One.\nJORGE: Your eyes are sharper than mine, Lichtfuss.\nLICHTPUSS: And V’ll warrant it was him who chewed up Hayashi’s assistant.\nJORGE: Poor little Victor. Still no change then. Stuck like that.\nJORGE: He was a playful chap when he was a whelp. Had the run of the pampas. He used to love to fetch a ball.\nLICHTFUSS: Before he got a taste for gaucho.\nJORGE: Oh, his mother’s too strict with him. It’s no good trying to stifle his natural instincts. That’s what's led to all this trouble in the first place.\nLICHTFUSS: She has her instincts too. Why else do you think the\nLICHTFUSS: Grey One has come?\nJORGE: For Victor. That’s what she said.\nLICHTFUSS: He’s come for her, not Victor. We all heard his call\nLICHTFUSS: across the city. And we saw what happened to Kanu Choudhry.\nJORGE: The Grey One. That’s a dark name. The old stories\nJORGE: say he’s cunning.\nLICHTFUSS: The First and Most Powerful. But would you know\nLICHTFUSS: him if you smelt him?\nSORGE: (SUDDENLY AFRAID) The strangers. Celery and goat op.\nLICHTFUSS: The ones we let go.\nJORGE: But suppose one of them was the Grey One. In the\nJORGE: stories, he's the master of shapes and delusion.\nLICHTFUSS: That’s very cunning indeed. Making us think we\nLICHTFUSS: could throw them off the train. But if he’s come for Neana...\nLICHTFUSS: sonee: Better hurry, mein herr. Before you lose your\nLICHTFUSS: ‘avours.\nLICHTFUSS: SCENE 28. VICTOR’S ROOM\nCINEZ: USHERS THE DOCTOR AND TURLOUGH INTO ILEANA AND HAYASHI’S PRESENCE.)\nINEZ: This way, Senhores.\nINEZ: 34\nILEANA: (SLOW BREATH) Extraordinary...\nDOCTOR: How do you do, Senhora? I apologise for intruding on your privacy. I’m the Doctor and this is...\nHAYASHI: (CUTTING IN} Doctor?\nDOCTOR: ..and this is Turlough, Senhora.\nILEANA: Please come in both of you.\nHAYASHI: What sort of doctor?\nDOCTOR: Peripatetic. I travel a lot. Permanently on call, you might say. What about you, mister...?\nHAYASHI: Doctor Matsuo Hayashi. Consultant Therianthropist Practitioner, Institute of Genomic Surgery, Kamakura University.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. And was this your equipment?\nDOCTOR: Someone’s made quite a mess of it.\nILEANA: CRRITATED) Doctor. I am Ileana de Santos. My late husband was owner of the Santos Cattle Empire.\nDOCTOR: Really. I think Turlough here is familiar with some of your produce.\nTURLOUGH: The dogs couldn’t get enough of it.\nTURLOUGH: DOCTOR And is this your private monorail? Where exactly is it heading?\nTURLOUGH: HAYASHI. How did you get on board?\nDOCTOR: Under my own steam.\nDOCTOR: ILEANA. We saw you at the station, Doctor. Please explain why you are here.\nDOCTOR: We came to warn you. Though from the state of your surgery, I fear I may be overdue.\nILEANA: What exactly did you want to warn us about?\nDOCTOR: I believe that there is a dangerous creature on board\nTURLOUGH: Only one?\nILEANA: Forgive us, Doctor. You find us in a state of some\nILEANA: alarm. My son, who is an invalid, has disappeared. And I fear he has been abducted.\nDOCTOR: (AWKWARD) Ah. Then Senhora, J fear I may be the bringer of bad news. I’m afraid Turlough and I found a body in the galley three carriages back. In the fridge.\nILEANA: In the fridge?\nDOCTOR: A young Asian man with black hair and a white lab coat.... what was left of it.\nHAYASHI: Jura!\nILEANA: Oh, thank God.\nHAYASHI: I told the little idiot to be careful. Now what am I going to tell the faculty!\nDOCTOR: Then I assume this wasn’t your son.\nILEANA: No, no, not Victor.\nTURLOUGH: He was badly savaged.\nHAYASHI: Jura is... was my assistant. Regrettably, a very careless one.\nTURLOUGH: (MUTTERING) Doctor, what about the wolf head?\nDOCTOR: Never mind that now. (TO HAYASHI) Perhaps we should verify his identity. I think you should come and see for yourself.\nHAYASHI: No, no, I take your word for it.\nILEANA: This is appalling. The young man was nursing my\nILEANA: 35\nILEANA: son. Obviously he was attacked when Victor was abducted.\nTURLOUGH: Just like we were attacked.\nILEANA: He attacked you? You saw him?\nTURLOUGH: Well, not exactly.\nDOCTOR: I saw something. It burst in on us. Drew the others off.\nILEANA: Yes?\nDOCTOR: A large animal, but walking upright like a man. At a\nDOCTOR: rough guess I'd call him a therianthropic metamorph. But then lycanthropy comes in so many shapes and sizes, doesn’t it? Weresharks, werepards, werewolves... What did you say your son was suffering from?\nTURLOUGH: At the station, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nTURLOUGH: We saw it at the station too. That shape running after\nTURLOUGH: the train. Like a wolf.\nTLEANA: What did you see? Was it grey?\nDOCTOR: Yes, grey and very large. Almost unfeasibly large, actually. That’s why we came. Although the wolf we saw on the train, the one that drew off your associates when they attacked us... I think that one was brown. And much smaller. More of a prairie than a timber wolf.\nILEANA: Inez!\nDOCTOR: Yes, definitely brown. Like the hairs here on this bed. FX; DOOR SLIDES OPEN.\nINEZ: Senhora?\nTLEANA: Inez, find Lichtfuss and Jorge.\nTLEANA: INEZ. Yes, Senhora.\nILEANA: No. Find Victor first!\nINEZ: Senhora,\nDOCTOR: Senhora, Id like to help.\nHAYASHI: Senhora de Santos's son is extremely ill. He needs constant medica) attention. Which only I can provide.\nDOCTOR: With metal vices and a straight jacket? That’s a\nDOCTOR: pretty extreme form of medication.\nILEANA: Who are you? Why make us your business?\nDOCTOR: I sensed danger, Senhora. That’s why I came to help.\nDOCTOR: Of course, if you’d rather, we could just stop the train and send for the Policia.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 26. TRAIN CARRIAGE\nLICHTFUSS: (MENACING) What did this Doctor say then?\nINEZ: He said he saw the Grey One... at the station.\nLICHTFUSS: And?\nINEZ: He came to warn the Senhora about it.\nJORGE: You said he was the Grey One, Lichtfuss.\nLICHTFUSS: You said he was cunning. He's lying, that’s all.\nJORGE: Suppose he knows we think he’s lying. He could be\nJORGE: telling the truth, so we'd never know. Now that’s really cunning. 36\nINEZ: Idiots. The springtime’s stolen your wits. The Doctor isn't the Grey One and the Senhora knows it.\nLICHTFUSS: And you know that it was Victor who did for Hayasnl 'S assistant. Of course I do. But who's going to dare tell the\nLICHTFUSS: Benbora that?\nLIGHTFUSS: This Doctor, with a bit of luck. We all know why he’s sniffing round her.\nINEZ: That’s as clear as a frosty night. He wants her.\nJORGE: But he's a cutclaw.\nINEZ: He’s not her first.\nLICHTFUSS: (GROWLS A LITTLE) What did she do? (BEAT) Tell\nLICHTFUSS: me! (INEZ GASPS IN PAIN) Tell me, Inez, or Ill bite off your ears!\nCINEZ: BITES LICHTFUSS. HE YELPS.)\nLICHTFUSS: Agh! You little bitch! ones LAUGHS)\nLICHTFUSS: Oh, she’s interested, mein herr. Oh, yes. She said, this peste 's worth more than the whole Santos Empire.\nLICHTFUSS: She wouldn't dare.\nINEZ: As for mein Herr Lichtfuss. She says he can crawl back to the backwoods where he belongs and hunt for beetles!\nINEZ: LICHT¥USS: That'll teach you to listen at doors! Never insult your Mistress again!\nJORGE: What about the cutclaws?\nLICHTFUSS: Easily dealt with. And maybe the Grey One's just an\nLICHTFUSS: old story to frighten puppies. There's only one way to win the Senhora’s favours. I must restore her wandering son.\nLICHTFUSS: SCENE 27. ILEANA’S CARRIAGE\nILEANA: (QUIETLY TERRIFIED) Pieter Stubbe. Leave me alone. Go away.\nILEANA: SLIGHTLY WITH VARYING RECEPTION.\nSTUBBE: CON LINK) Ileana? Is that you? Can you see me too? (BHAT) I missed my welcome, Ileana, so I persuaded a cutclaw to show me how to use this device.\nILEANA: I have nothing to say to you. STUBBE. What's the matter? You look like a dog with a docked tail. (LAUGHS COARSELY) I hardly knew you. The merchant's daughter become quite the merchant's wife. Very tamed and domesticated. And doting on your half-cutclaw whelp.\nILEANA: Leave my son alone! It was my choice. You never gave me a choice.\nSTUBBE: What about our times together? Remember the snowy forests and the mountains? Chasing the sledges for sport. That was an ocean away from this dust-choked, ill-gotten desert. In those days you hhad eyes and ears for me alone. No one else. Even now, when you're ae you can't look away.\nSTUBBE: You'll never touch me again. You won't find me. ['m\nSTUBBE: Pd\nSTUBBE: one. SrUBBE: I’m closer than you think. (BEAT) How many other suitors are panting round you now? One less at any rate. He whimpered like a beaten mongrel before I relieved him of his head. Tell your other admirers they'll get the same. (BHAT) Still nothing to say? Pah! I hate to talk to someone I can’t smell. Keep running, Neana. However fast you run. I’ll run faster...\nILEANA: Leave me alone. Monster.\nILEANA: SCENE 28. TRAIN CORRIDOR\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? I saw something out there. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Patience, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I saw something from the window.\nDOCTOR: It’s a bit dark to see anything. Just desert and the Shosts of dead trees.\nTURLOUGH: No. In the moonlight. Something running along through the scrub. Some sort of big animal. Very big.\nDOCTOR: There’s bound to be some wildlife still out there. Struggling to survive after the death of the forest.\nTURLOUGH: How fast are we going?\nDOCTOR: About two hundred miles an hour.\nTURLOUGH: We can't be.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps a little more. Why?\nTURLOUGH: Because it was keeping pace with the train. And then\nTURLOUGH: it veered off. It was going even faster. Doctor, it was the grey wolf we saw at the station.\nDOCTOR: Stay here.\nTURLOUGH: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: (DEPARTING) To speak to our hostess.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor! Come back! (GIVES UP) Don't leave me here. Not in the middle of a pack of werewolves.\nJORGE: Closer than he thinks.\nLICHTFUSS: Look at those eyes. He'd see us if he wanted to.\nJORGE: An orphan cub if ever I smelt one.\nTURLOUGH: ‘Who's there?\nLICHTFUSS: He’d see a lot of things if he looked. Both outside and in.\nJORGE: What a waste if we didn’t show him his potential.\nTURLOUGH: Where are you? I know you're here.\nTURLOUGH: (TURLOUGH IS GRABBED. A HAND COVERS HIS MOUTH. HE STRUGGLES.)\nLICHTFUSS: See us now, young master? Time we woke you up. We have to catch a wild dog. And you're just the bait we need to help us.\nLICHTFUSS: SCENE 29. ILRANA’S ROOM\nLICHTFUSS: 38\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING WITH URGENCY) Senhora, I want to stop the train.\nILEANA: Impossible. Jorge has programmed the journey into the drive system.\nDOCTOR: There must be a failsafe way to stop it.\nILEANA: Nothing can override the programme until we reach our destination.\nDOCTOR: And then what happens to Turlough and me?\nILEANA: Lhaven’t decided.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me. You're concerned about your son. In fact, you seem beset by troubles\nILEANA: Danger has always walked with me, Doctor. It’s my oldest and most faithful companion.\nDOCTOR: But sometimes it comes and locks you in the face.\nILEANA: And are you another danger?\nDOCTOR: I couldn’t say, Senhora. I leave it up to you. But I do like to be surprising.\nILEANA: I think you already know what I have to tell you.\nDOCTOR: That your son is a wolf. Yes, I know.\nILEANA: And that he takes after his mother.\nDOCTOR: I’ve never known a mother who wasn’t proud of her son.\nILEANA: Proud? How can you think that? It’s the very curse of my long, long existence. Proud! No, never.\nDOCTOR: I remain to be convinced. And what about your husband?\nILEANA: Federico was a Cariocan. Rio was his city. For forty-\nILEANA: two years he cared for me, driving back the shadows that surround me. But as you see, I do not age as he did. Victor was the son that he craved above all his wealth, his land, his empire.\nDOCTOR: He didn’t know about Victor’s condition?\nILEANA: Oh, yes. But Federico never questioned, just accepted. All his life he was plagued by guilt over the ruin that he said his business, the ranches and cattle, brought to the great forest. But he never ceased to love us.\nDOCTOR: And Victor?\nILEANA: Like all children he rebels. But now he has no human father, his wolf inheritance has taken hold.\nDOCTOR: And he cannot change back.\nILEANA: No.\nDOCTOR: Td say he makes a handsome wolf.\nILEANA: It waxes and wanes in all of us. But poor Victor has\nILEANA: no light left. He's all instinct. Like the dusk, the shadows of the past lengthen around us.\nDOCTOR: And one particular grey shadow pursues you.\nILEANA: The Grey One. Pieter Stubbe. Undying and always hungry. I’ve been bound to him and his darkness for longer than you could ever imagine.\nILEANA: pOocToOR: I think you’d be surprised. One hundred? Two hundred years?\nILEANA: How can you possibly know that?\nDOCTOR: Time is my business. Weil, one of my businesses. But\nDOCTOR: 39\nDOCTOR: please, I’m stopping your story.\nILEANA: My father was a merchant from Smolensk. Quite rich, with land and serfs.\nDOCTOR: Imperial Russia. Let me guess. First half of the nineteenth century.\nILEANA: The summer of eighteen hundred and twelve.\nDOCTOR: The year of Napoleon's futile invasion. And stormy weather too, as I remember.\nTLEANA: Do you? (BEAT) We were fleeing the advancing\nTLEANA: French, but our carts ran into bandits. We lost all our belongings. And my father was shot.\nDOCTOR: And then you were rescued by a wolf.\nILEANA: By a handsome partisan, who turned out to be a wolf.\nDOCTOR: And he brought out all the wildness in you.\nTLEANA: And the dark. Oh, Doctor, it seems that however far I\nTLEANA: chase the sun, the oncoming night and the moon are always baying at the door behind me. They never let me rest.\nDOCTOR: Neana, suppose the shadow reaches your destination before you do?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 30. THE DESERT.\nDOCTOR: SHELTERED. THE CLICK OF HER RECORDER. BUT THIS TIME WE\nHEAR: HER, NOT HER RECORDING.\nROSA: You said it never got cold, Grandpa. Not in the old\nROSA: days. But Jeez, the wind's sharp tonight. Reckon you could slice meat with it.\nROSA: And the moon's strong. No one to talk to. Just me and the dust devils.\nSTUBBE: Good day, young lady.\nROSA: Jeezuz!\nSTUBBE: Whither away? So close to the silver path.\nROSA: (TERRIFIED) Wither away, yerself. And it’s not day. It’s way past midnight.\nSTUBBE: Once this desert was a mighty forest.\nROSA: Too right. They took it away. Like they take everything.\nSTUBBE: And left the dust. Is that meat you have there?\nROSA: Just a ‘dillo I whistled up.\nSTUBBE: Cooked him in his shell?\nROSA: Maybe.\nSTUBBE: (COMING CLOSER) Give me some. I've come a long, long way without food.\nROSA: Get your own.\nROSA: Just one morsel for a lonely traveller.\nROSA: Back off, lobo. Go scavenging some place else.\nSTUBBB: Oh, but there’s a wicked fate that waits for greedy @irls. Girls who can't spare a bite for a wandering soul. (MENACING)\nSTUBBB: 40\nSTUBBB: Just one bite.\nROSA: I said, back away. 1 know what you are, loup-garou.\nROSA: See this knife. Pure silver, yeah? My grandpa made it\nROSA: out of silver from the mines under the dead forest. And it'll take a bite out of you before you bite me.\nSTUBBE: (LAUGHS) Little girl, your claws need cutting. Stay by your silver path, then. But don’t stray, because one night I’ll be waiting round the next corner and I’ll still be hungry.\nROSA: I won't forget.\nSTUBBE: (DEPARTING) Gute nacht, Meine liebchen.\nROSA: (FADING INTO DISTANCE) Tchau, Senhor Wolf.\nROSA: SCENE 51. THE DESERT\nROSA: OUT ON A MOBILE VIDLINK PHONE. A CLICK AS If GETS ANSWERED.\nHAYASHI: (ON LINE) Stubbe? Returning my call at last?\nSTUBBE: I don’t come to your whistle, Hayashi. What’s your news?\nHAYASHI: We're not far from our destination.\nSTUBBE: Rancho de Santos?\nHAYASHI: I assume so. But her son’s running loose on the train\nSTUBBE: (LAUGHS) So much for Ileana's house-training.\nHAYASHI: And there are strangers too. A so-called Doctor and his assistant.\nSTUBBE: Those two again. They run fast for a brace of cutclaw footpads.\nHAYASHI: The Senhora seemed most taken with the Doctor.\nSTUBBE: That's no matter. Neana can coax as many suitors as\nSTUBBE: she likes. Once I'm back with her, she’ll soon forget the panting of a few lovesick poodles. And I’ll leave their carcasses to feed the desert dogs.\nSTUBBE: SCENE 32. TRAIN COMPARTMENT\nTURLOUGH: When are you going to tear me apart? Isn’t that what werewolves do?\nLICHTFUSS: Don’t believe everything you see in old films.\nJORGE: Or hear in old stories. (Note - Obviously no one reads anymore)\nTURLOUGH: Right\nLICHTFUSS: Do we look like ravening monsters?\nTURLOUGH: What about the wolf-man I saw?\nLICHTFUSS: Sometimes the darker side tips the scales. Nothing to\nLICHTFUSS: be ashamed of.\nJORGE: And werewolf is a cutclaw name. I’ve always found it\nJORGE: deeply offensive.\nLICHTFUSS: But it’s important to make amends. Jorge, a drink for\nLICHTFUSS: 41\nLICHTFUSS: our guest.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry?\nLIGHTFUSS: We wanted to know more about you.\nJORGE: Once we realised you were more than just human...\nTURLOUGH: Thanks very much. So trying to throw me off the train was fine when I was just pond life.\nJORGE: A drink.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you. (DRINKS)\nLICHTIFUSS: Humans are just cattle to us. They’re cutclaws. Over the years they’ve forcibly subdued their darker instincts.\nJORGE: They’ve dulled their wits.\nTURLOUGH: Tell me about it. Sometimes I thought I'd drown in their stupidity.\nLICHTFPUSS: Yes, yes. We knew you'd understand. Haven’t you always felt that you were different.\nTURLOUGH: Superior. I always knew that. What’s in this stuff?\nJORGE: More?\nTURLOUGH: It's good. And the Doctor doesn’t have to know, does\nTURLOUGH: he? (MIMICKING THE DOCTOR) Turlough, are you sure that’s wise? (GIGGLES) Oh, I suppose he means well.\nLICHTFUSS: But you've always felt alone. That you didn’t belong.\nTURLOUGH: (SLIGHTLY TIPSY) More than that. I’m special. I never, ever got the respect I deserved. What about all that stuff with howling and the full moon?\nJORGE: dust another haif-truth overblown by Hollywood.\nTURLOUGH: Yes?\nJORGE: Oh, yes.\nLICHTFUSS: But Turlough, you have another side that no one else recognised. Look in the mirror. See for yourself.\nTURLOUGH: What? Uh, I look a wreck.\nLICHTFUSS: Keep looking. Look hard.\nTURLOUGH: Better than a dull-witted human though. (RAMBLING) You know what? Wits are like claws. You have to keep them sharp.\nLICHTFUSS: Look through yourself. Look at the real Turlough\nLICHTFUSS: behind ee: whats do you want to see? No. No, not cutclaws. Cut-throatsI (STARTS\nLICHTFUSS: Look harder!\nLICHTFUSS: (STILL LAUGHING) The old ones are the best!\nLICHTFUSS: What do you want to see?\nLICHTFUSS: What don’t you want to see?\nLICHTFUSS: What doesn't he want us to see?\nLICHTFUSS: Keep looking.\nLICHTFUSS: (GASPS, SUDDENLY AFRAID.) No! What is it?\nLICHTFUSS: You tell us, Turlough.\nLICHTFUSS: It’s behind me! Make it go away! Take it away!\nLICHTFUSS: Odd, isn't it? We’re all of us surprised the first time\nLICHTFUSS: we see the truth.\nLICHTFUSS: SCENE 535. VICTOR’S ROOM\nLICHTFUSS: 42\nHAYASHI: (NERVOUS) Five million, Mr Stubbe. You said I should name my price.\nSTUBBE: (ON VIDLINK) Five million what? Is this money that you're talking about, Hayashi?\nHAYASHI: ‘Yes, you said once I'd finished...\nSTUBBE: I swallowed a tax gatherer once. Joshua of\nSTUBBE: Darmstadt. Swallowed him whole. Never again. I was spitting coins for days afterwards.\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) Well, he must be here somewhere...\nSTUBBE: And you want money. (HE LAUGHS AT THIS FOOLISHNESS)\nHAYASHI: (PANICKED WHISPER) They’re coming! Pll call you back.\nHAYASHI: (OVER COMPENSATING) Senhora. Is there any sign of your son?\nILEANA: No trace or trail.\nDOCTOR: And now my companion has disappeared as well. I don't suppose he wandered this way.\nHAYASHI: I’ve seen no one. So sorry.\nILEANA: Who were you speaking to?\nHAYASHI: Speaking?\nDOCTOR: On the vidlink, when we came in.\nHAYASHI: Oh, that. The university. To my faculty. I was trying to explain about dura.\nILEANA: I told you to speak to no one while you are in my service!\nHAYASHI: My apologies. (POINTEDLY) It was a bad link with a lot of interference.\nILEANA: Hayashi, when my son is found, I want you to share\nILEANA: your diagnoses with the Doctor here. (BEAT) I'm sure he can be of assistance to you.\nDOCTOR: dust think of me as a complete novice.\nHAYASHI: (COLD) I’m sure not. (SMARM) I bow to your obvious superior experience, Doctor... san.\nDOCTOR: CRESPONDING IN KIND) And I to yours, Hayashi...\nDOCTOR: san. Perhaps we could start by checking the damage to your equipment.\nILEANA: (QUIET) Don’t move, either of you.\nHAYASHI: What’s that?\nILEANA: Don’t move. Outside the window. Hanging down.\nCLAWS: TAPPING ON THE WINDOW.\nDOCTOR: Your son, I take it.\nDOCTOR: HAYASHI. He’s on the roof. He’ll be swept off.\nILEANA: Victor. Victor, listen to me...\nDOCTOR: He’s fully transformed. A complete lycanthropic metamorphosis.\nILEANA: Victor, please come in. It’s safe. They won’t hurt you. I won't let them. Victor, please...\nDOCTOR: Stay here, Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: What are you doing? He's my patient.\nILEANA: He's slipping! Victor, hold on!\nILEANA: 4B\nDOCTOR: Hold my coat. I’m going out after him.\nHAYASHI: You're mad. Senhora, stop this maniac.\nILBANA: Don't move, either of you. You'll frighten him.\nILBANA: THE ROAR OF THE TRAIN FROM OUTSIDE. VICTOR THUMPS THROUGH INSIDE. HE SNARLS ANGRILY. HAYASHI YELLS.\nILBANA: SCENE 34, TRAIN COMPARTMENT\nTURLOUGH: Stop it staring! Make it go away!\nINEZ: (SURPRISED) What's happening? Lichtfuss, what are you doing now?\nLICHTFUSS: dust enlightening our young guest, Inez. Don’t say you didn’t notices Turlough’s potential.\nINEZ: You're supposed to be looking for Victor.\nLICHTFUSS: Victor can’t get far. And this could help.\nINEZ: What will help?\nTURLOUGH: (SHIVERING) It’s there. Behind me. Make it stop staring at me.\nINEZ: What are you doing to him?\nLIGHTFUSS: dust getting another gift for the Senhora.\nJORGE: (GENTLY) Turlough? We didn’t force you to look in the mirror, did we?\nTURLOUGH: Please. Make it stop.\nINEZ: Not the mirror trick. It’s all a game, isn’t it? Haven’t\nINEZ: you learnt yet? An awakening should be a precious, sacred moment. Not something for your amusement.\nJORGE: Once he started, we could hardly stop him.\nLICHTFUSS: Turlough, tell us what you can see.\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) It’s there. Behind me. A blood red\nTURLOUGH: shadow. Is it my shadow? It has burning golden eyes.\nINEZ: Are you both mad? He’ll be scarred for life. Centuries of misery. Stop it now.\nLICHTFUSS: Don’t touch him!\nINEZ: Idiots! I'm going to fetch the Senhora.\nTURLOUGH: (SUDDEN YELL) No! Stop it! Help me! It’s trying to\nTURLOUGH: push in front! Help me! Doctor!\nINEZ: Idiots! Stop him! Get him back!\nINEZ: SCENE 35. VICTOR’S ROOM\nVICTOR: IS GROWLING MENACINGLY. THE OTHERS ARE BUNCHED\nTOGETHER: TRAPPED BY THE BRUTE.\nILEANA: Victor, liebchen. No need to be afraid. Look, no one’s going to hurt you.\nILEANA: It's alright, little one. It’s alright. Come to me.\nILEANA: 44\nHAYASHI: (MUTTERING) If she calms him, I may be able to reach my tranquilliser gun.\nILEANA: Victor.\nDOCTOR: Bad idea, Hayashi. Senhora, do you want us to leave?\nHAYASHI: You can’t leave her alone with him.\nDOCTOR: She’s his mother. Who better?\nILEANA: Yes. Yes, please back off slowly. Look Victor, liebchen,\nILEANA: we're nearly home. No more train. No more upset.\nILEANA: That's right. There we are. That’s it. (HE SNUGGLES IN.) Oh, my dear one. Come and nuzzle. That's it. Good.

(SLIGHTLY DISTANT) Yes, Senhora.\nILEANA: You travel with your machines in the hover-truck. Jorge will drive.\nHAYASHI: Senhora, I accompany your son. I have to administer his medication.\nILEANA: No. The Doctor travels with me.\nHAYASHI: CENOWING) Ah. I see.\nILEANA: Give me the correct dosage. We'll make sure Victor gets it.\nDOCTOR: Senhora? I think it would be better...\nILEANA: You travel with me, Doctor. Where I can keep an eye on you.\nILEANA: SCENE 43, THE DESERT\nLIGHT: WIND TO EMPHASISE THE SPEED.\nLICHTFUSS: (MUTTERING IN ANGRY BURSTS AS HE RUNS) Running errands. Why me? While Be stays. Find the goat meat stinking boy. Why’s the Doctor staying? Ha! (AN IDEA)\nRUNS: AGAIN.\nLICHTFUSS: (JUBILANT) Because he can't run. Not like me! She sent me. As a favour to her, she said. No one better!\nLICHTFUSS: SECONDS.\nLICHTFUSS: (NAGGING DOUBT RETURNS) So what happens while I'm out of the way? She wouldn’t. She wouldn’t dare! I'll show her favours!\nEARS: HAS STOPPED. SILENCE FOR A MOMENT.\nLICHTFUSS: Who's there? (SNIFFS) Who is it?\nLICHTFUSS: (RECOGNISING THE PRESENCE) Ah.\nJOINS: IN.\nLICHTFUSS: Well, good evening to you, brothers. It’s a fine moonlit night to go prowling.\nLICHTFUSS: SCENE 44. THE DESERT.\nLICHTFUSS: ROSA. Down here, yerpi-boy.\nTURLOUGH: I thought we were moving on.\nROSA: No point till the moon’s down and the sun’s up. Safer that way.\nTURLOUGH: (UNEASY) Rosa? This wolf you’re supposed to be meeting.\nROSA: Told you. He’s my fight.\nTURLOUGH: What sort of wolf? Grey? Brown? Big? Giant? (GULP) On four feet... or two? I mean, would you know him if you saw him?\nROSA: He ain’t you, if that’s what you think.\nTURLOUGH: How would you know?\nROSA: ‘Cos he’s so big, he could bite the moon.\nROSA: OF A TRASHY AMERICAN CARTOON THEME.\nROSA: (LAUGHS) Grandpa says I sound like the sat-vid. You seen Jaguar Maiden? “Save the Forest. Battle the Dark!” Cos that’s me.\nTURLOUGH: I never watch TV. I'll take Grandpa's word for it. Just turn it off.\nROSA: (SHRUG) It’s old stuff. But I ain’t no re-run. (TV\nANNOUNCER: ACCENT) “Franchised to you by the makers of Santos burgers.” (GIGGLES) That big old wolf. He was really mad about the forest.\nTURLOUGH: (LAUGHING) Why? What did he say?\nROSA: See. Knew you'd seen him too. That what you're running from?\nTURLOUGH: I don't think I ever stop running.\nROSA: Yeah?\nTURLOUGH: I saw him at the Carnaval. That huge red mouth. What did he say? Why was he so mad?\nROSA: Cos he didn't know. He thought the forest was all gone.\nTURLOUGH: But it has. It’s just dust. There’s nothing left.\nROSA: That’s what you think, yerpi-boy.\nROSA: TURLOUGH. So where is it then?\nROSA: I got it.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nROSA: No kidding. Grandpa told me.\nTURLOUGH: Oh well, he'd know.\nROSA: (SUDDEN ANGER) Too right. He was wise man of our\nROSA: tribe. Last one left before they cut down the trees and the river choked. But the spirits stayed with him. And now they’re with me. And I can’t get to sleep cos they’re in my head doing wild crazy dances. All the trees and birds and animals. Shaking the ground. Yada yada ya.\nTURLOUGH: (SHIVERS) Yes. Right.\nROSA: Right now. All dancing. Yada yada... (BEAT)\nROSA: 54\nROSA: (SUDDENLY QUIET. A BIT SUGGESTIVE) You cold?\nTURLOUGH: That's what they tell me. Cold right to the heart.\nROSA: You got pale eyes, yerpi.\nTURLOUGH: My name's Turlough.\nROSA: Thought your eyes were ice first off. But it’s more like the moon inside your head, peeking out at me.\nTURLOUGH: All the better to see you with.\nROSA: Grandpa gave me this. It’s a jaguar pelt. Only the headman gets to wear it.\nTURLOUGH: And now you're the head.\nROSA: Maybe one day. When I prove who I am. Maybe I'l get a wolf pelt instead.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t be silly. This is better.\nROSA: Grandpa says the first ones wrapped themselves in\nROSA: it. Back under the first moon. When the world was the unripe seed before it grew into the forest.\nTURLOUGH: It’s warm. Almost as if it was alive.\nROSA: That’s right. (KNOWING) So if you’re cold, Turlough, yerpi-boy, you'd better come under here right now.\nROSA: SCENE 45. ILEANA’S HOVER TRUCK\nCINEZ: IS DRIVING UP FRONT. THE DOCTOR AND ILEANA ARE IN THE BACK, TENDING VICTOR.)\nDOCTOR: It'll be light soon, Ileana. How much further? TLEANA. Twenty kilometres to the ranch. But the desert’s swallowed the road. It may take Inez longer. Shouldn't you have given Victor his medication by now?\nDOCTOR: He’s still asleep. I think we should wait a bit.\nILEANA: But Hayashi said the dosage should be increased.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know he did. But I think we can afford to be a\nDOCTOR: little less zealous. We don’t want Victor so reliant on drugs that he can’t cope without.\nILEANA: IRRITATED) Why are we going so slowly? (CALLING OUT) Inez, get a move on.\nDOCTOR: This truck's airworthy. isn't it? So why are we\nDOCTOR: igen Hie. ground?\nDOCTOR: We can't fly, Doctor. Don’t you know that? We’re parte ‘bound creatures. Our elements are earth and water. We need to be in touch with the soil and rock. The earth’s old bones.\nDOCTOR: So that’s why you drove straight through the Carnaval crowds in Rio.\nILEANA: Even a first floor apartment makes me feel queasy. And as for aircraft..\nDOCTOR: “T am fire and air. My other elements, I give to baser life.” Sorry, it’s just a quote. Cleopatra in her tomb.\nILEANA: The queen of ancient Egypt?\nDOCTOR: Poetic licence really. In real life, she had the all the subtle wit of a carpet beater.\nDOCTOR: wt a\nILEANA: (AMUSED) I take it that observation’s not from personal experience.\nDOCTOR: It’s certainly more than just hearsay.\nILEANA: Exactly how old are you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That's a question I usually ignore.\nILEANA: But.\nDOCTOR: (TEASING) They say I’m @ lot younger than I used to be.\nILEANA: You mean you're a lot older than you look.\nDOCTOR: Now you’re being unnecessarily personal.\nILEANA: Of course, I am. How old are you really? And how do you travel? How did you get on board the train?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Guess.\nTLEANA: (MOVING IN) My dearest Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (QUICKLY) Yes, definitely soon be light. And still no\nDOCTOR: sign of your friend Stubbe.\nILEANA: (BARELY HIDDEN DISAPPOINTMENT) Oh, he’ll find us, Doctor. He’s always hunting. He’s always angry and hungry. Pieter Stubbe is centuries old and he has a hundred appetites.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like a bad case of worms to me. I knew I should have gone for Turlough.\nILEANA: (COLD) And I have a pack of lone wolves to face. The\nILEANA: only way to make a stand against Pieter is to work together. (CALLING) Inez! Get a move on. It'll be new moon before we get there!\nILEANA: SCENE 46. THE DESERT\nROSA: Grandpa? The sky’s all on fire away beyond the dead river. It’s like the sun's coming up on the wrong side of the morning. Reckon something's burning. Maybe the Mission? Hey, Gramps, I got a boyfriend too. Okay, so he’s a yerp and he ain’t seen TV. But he knows about forests and the loups-garoux...\nTURLOUGH: Do you tell all your secrets to your wristwatch?\nROSA: (STARTLED) It’s a perscom. Get your own. (BEAT) How long you been awake?\nTURLOUGH: I was watching the moon.\nROSA: Want a cola?\nTURLOUGH: Not really.\nROSA: Your loss, yerpi-boy. (SWIGS THE CAN.)\nTURLOUGH: I was thinking about the forests where I come from.\nROSA: Okay, okay. You still got forests. I heard that. TURLOUGH. No. Not the sort of forests you’re thinking of. Where I come from, the forests are three times as tall.\nROSA: Yeah?\nTURLOUGH: The leaves are all thick fleshy plates and you can\nTURLOUGH: walk on them, in spirals right up to the top of the canopy - all mauves and purples with blood red trunks. And after winter, when the suns first get warm, there are swarms of moths. They've got wings like cut\nTURLOUGH: 56\nTURLOUGH: sapphires and they blot out the white sky like glittering blue smoke.\nROSA: Yeah, right. In your head.\nTURLOUGH: Maybe it is. Maybe I just imagined I can’t get back there. But it’s a lot better than anything I’ve seen in your real world.\nROSA: See. We both got a headful of forest. So I got thinking. Maybe you are the future I was waiting for.\nTURLOUGH: Don't count on it.\nROSA: We're in this together.\nTURLOUGH: No. No, Rosa, I don't want you to trust me.\nROSA: You telling me what to do?\nTURLOUGH: dust don't. Look, I can’t say.\nROSA: not?\nTURLOUGH: Because... (GIGHS IN DEFEAT) Because I’ve got this... dark side. It always comes out and hurts others.\nROSA: So?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t want you hurt, Rosa. I’m not reliable. I don’t\nTURLOUGH: even trust myself. Given the choice, I always prefer the dark, where no one can see me... Then they don't know who or what I really am.\nROSA: You're a yerpi-boy.\nROSA: itramaichams CHALF LAUGHS) No, that's just what you're meant to\nROSA: We OMINOUS SILENCE. THE CRICKETS HAVE STOPPED.\nBOSA: Listen.\nTURLOUGH: It’s gone too quiet.\nTURLOUGH: (AFRAID) There's something out there. In the shadows.\nROSA: (HISSED WHISPER) Not Don’t run.\nTURLOUGH: Let go of me. You don’t understand. I’ve seen it. It’s my dark side.\nROSA: Turlough...\nTURLOUGH: It was howling after my blood. And now it’s coming after me. We can’t fight it. We have to get away!\nROSA: Shut it, yerpi-boy! There’s more than one out there.\nROSA: Maybe a whole pack. But no Loup-Garou’s gonna get to you without getting past me first!\nROSA: SCENE 47. ILEANA’S HOVER TRUCK CILEANA WITH VICTOR. THE DOCTOR LISTENING)\nILEANA: It’s alright, Victor. Don’t fret. We'll soon be home. What about your favourite story? The one with the old wolf woman in the forest. And one day an old, old wolf with icicles in his fur came to her. His name was Winter and he begged her to hide him, for a young wolf called Spring was driving him out of the wood. So she took him into her den and hid him. All year long, her den was cold as ice, and snow piled up on the inside of her door. But she put on her coat and kept him safe. Just like I keep you safe, dearest Victor.\nVICTOR: Mother.\nILEANA: CMMENSE RELIEF) That’s right, Victor. Mother’s\nILEANA: 5\nILEANA: here. Now sleep. Just sleep.\nILEANA: (QUIETLY, TO THE DOCTOR) it’s working, Doctor. I knew it would. I knew Hayashi’s medication would work.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad he’s getting better. But I doubt it's the drugs that are improving his condition.\nILEANA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: More likely, it’s the lack of them.\nILEANA: What is it? Inez!\nDOCTOR: An explosion. Must be several miles ahead.\nILEANA: The ranch!\nILEANA: SCENE 48. THE DESERT\nILEANA: ROSA.\nTURLOUGH: Tall, aren’t they?\nROSA: Wever seen so many. See any that look like you, Turlough? Course not. No redhead wolves here. (SHOUTS) Okay you mutts, I’m ready for you!\nTURLOUGH: Don’t provoke them!\nROSA: They’re waiting. Come on, lobos. We’re waiting too!\nTURLOUGH: Look, if we could start a fire...\nROSA: No time. Got my knife. Grab yourself a branch.\nTURLOUGH: A branch'll never hold off so many. Someone once told me that to stop the wolves, you throw the baby out of the sledge.\nROSA: You got a Grandpa too?\nROSA: TUnLOUSE: Sometimes you’d think so. But I meant to distract them.\nROSA: Okay. You’re headman.\nTURLOUGH: CUNEASY) Right. Get up close to the bushes. Then\nTURLOUGH: they’ve only of one line of attack.\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing?\nROSA: This is my second skin.\nTURLOUGH: The jaguar pelt.\nROSA: Wolf takes a man, but jaguar takes a wolf. It’s mine\nROSA: to wear. Spirit of the forest. And the forest’s in me.\nROSA: TURLOUGH. They don’t like that.\nROSA: And I got a claw of silver.\nTURLOUGH: Rosa, don’t be a stupid kid.\nROSA: Ancient spirits rise in me. Be in me. Ancient spirits\nROSA: rise in me. Be in me...(REPEATS)\nTURLOUGH: Rosa! Stop it! Stay here!\nROSA: Get off me! (PULLS FREE) Forest spirits be in me.\nROSA: Rise in me. Save the forest..\nROSA: 58\nTURLOUGH: Rosa!\nTURLOUGH: THEM.\nROSA: (STRUGGLING WITH THE WOLF) Battle... the dark!\nROSA: Okay, lobos! Which of you’s next for the Jaguar Maiden?!\nROSA: Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: Get away from me!\nROSA: I got it!\nROSA: (JUBILANT) Silver bites, lobos! Stay clear!\nTURLOUGH: The big white one! Look out!\nWHICH: WE HEAR WOLF SNARLS AND THE HINT OF BIG CAT.\nTURLOUGH: Rosa!\nTURLOUGH: Get off her! Get off!\nROSA: Got it.\nTURLOUGH: (HORRIFIED) It’s a man. It was human! Oh, God, I hate this planet!\nROSA: (QUIET. BREATHING FAST & WITH DIFFICULTY.) Is it dead?\nTURLOUGH: Think so. The rest've pulled back again. (BEAT) You're bleeding.\nROSA: They’re no pack of werewolves.\nTURLOUGH: Gently...\nROSA: A pack would attack together. Ow, my shoulder!\nTURLOUGH: What's that? They’re pulling right back. They're going. Just like before.\nROSA: (AFRAID) It's him. The Lobo King...\nSTUBBE: (ON THE RECORDER -From Part &) “But don’t stray, because one night I'll be waiting round the next corner and I'll still be hungry.”\nTURLOUGH: (AGITATED) No. That's what he said to me. He’s coming for me, not you.\nROSA: Turlough...\nTURLOUGH: I'll get him away, Rosa. It’s me he wants. Try to hide.\nTURLOUGH: I'll get him away.\nROSA: Turlough! Come back!\nROSA: Where’s my knife? (SHE STARTS TO COUGH) You took my knife.\nROSA: 59\nFROM: TURLOUGH WHICH GOES MUFFLED AS HE'S SWALLOWED ALIVE.\nROSA: Turlough! (BEAT. THEN HALF-CRYING) Turlough. It’s my fight. My goddamn fight!

ANOTHER TRUCK RUNS DOWN A LITTLE WAY OFF.\nILEANA: (DISBELIEF) It’s gone. The whole ranch. Just blown away.\nDOCTOR: Don't go too close.\nINEZ: Senhora?\nILEANA: (ANGRY) Federico built it for us! For Victor and me!\nINEZ: Senhora?\nILEANA: Let me be!\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Inez, what about the others?\nINEZ: They should have been here. Tino and twenty more, waiting for the Senhora.\nDOCTOR: We must search for any survivors. Perhaps you and Jorge... Neana. I’m sorry.\nILEANA: He did this.\nDOCTOR: Pieter Stubbe?\nILEANA: The shadow, as you say, Doctor, got here before us.\nDOCTOR: Does he really hate you so much?\nILEANA: He’s Pieter Stubbe. He revels in hatred. It’s what he is. He never changes.\nHAYASHI: (COMING UP) Senhora? What's happened?\nCUILEANA: GRABS HIM)\nTLEANA: (FURIOUS) Did you know this, Hayashi? Have you spoken to Pieter Stubbe?\nTLEANA: HAYASHI. To who? I don't know what you mean!\nDOCTOR: (WARNING ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAS SEEN) Tleana.\nILEANA: How did he know where we were going? How did he know my vidlink code?\nHAYASHI: I'm here to cure your son...\nINEZ: Senhora.\nTLEANA: Liar! I'll tear your throat out!\nDOCTOR: Tleana, look.\nILEANA: What?\nINEZ: CIN AWE) They’re all here. All of them.\nHAYASHI: They’re all monsters.\nDOCTOR: They're all wolves. (MUTTERING) Stay by me, Hayashi. Whatever you do, don’t move suddenly.\nILEANA: CADDRESSING THE PACK) Sisters and brothers. I\nILEANA: 60\nILEANA: feared that this disaster had overtaken us, but you have answered my summons. Thank you all. We have much to speak of. (SENSES TROUBLE.) What is it? What's the matter? Anton? Is that you skulking there? Why are you back so soon?\nILEANA: EMERGES, APPROACHING ILEANA.\nDOCTOR: Is this Herr Lichtfuss? HAYASHI. In his true shape.\nINEZ: The fool. What’s he carrying?\nDOCTOR: Weil, it’s not Turlough.\nILEANA: Anton? Is this for me?\nILEANA: FEET.\nROSA: (GROANING) ...Grandpa...?\nLICHTFUSS: (HIS VOICE IS A DEEP GROWL) A token of my devotion.\nILEANA: What is it? I didn’t send you out for this.\nLICHTFUSS: (PLAYING THE CROWD) For all to see. I bring this\nLICHTFUSS: gift for you to do with as you will.\nILEANA: She’s just @ cutclaw child.\nLICHTFUSS: She fights like a forest cat. She killed Mr Talbot with a silver blade before I overpowered her.\nLICHTFUSS: She’s yours, Neana. She should be driven and hunted. As should all cutclaws.\nTLEANA: What nonsense. I sent you to find Turlough. Where is he?\nLICHTFUSS: You'll not see that little skunk again.\nDOCTOR: (MOVING IND Why? What's happened to him?\nLICHTFUSS: Ah. (TO THE WOLVES) This is him, brothers and\nLICHTFUSS: sisters. This is the latest cutclaw that she grants her favours to.\nDOCTOR: Where’s Turlough, Lichtfuss?\nLICHIFUSS: Gone. Swallowed down. Barely a mouthful, I'd say.\nILEANA: Who swallowed him? (GROWING FEAR - TO THE\nILEANA: PACK) Why are you all in wolf-shape? Why this blood-lust? Who have you been talking to?\nDOCTOR: Turlough's my friend. Who’s responsible?\nILEANA: The Doctor is to be trusted. He helped save my son.\nHAYASHI: CANGRY)D Saved him? What have you done, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Go away, Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: Now you see what it’s like to lose an assistant. And Victor is my work.\nDOCTOR: Hayashi, to you he’s just a laboratory rat!\nLICHTFUSS: So this Doctor saved your son. Is he wolf, born and\nLICHTFUSS: blooded? Is he stronger than me? If I challenge him, will he face me, tooth and claw? (BEAT) Will you, Doctor? (BEAT) Well?\nDOCTOR: (CALM) You’re wasting your time, Lichtfuss. There are greater threats to your people.\nILEANA: (HURT) Doctor?\nILEANA: 61\nLICHTFUSS: He is too weak to face me! Ileana, by our laws and with no other challenge, I claim you as my matel\nILEANA: IT belong to no one, Lichtfuss!\nSTUBBE: (DISTANT) Ileana!\nDOCTOR: Inez, is this him? The shadow you've been running from?\nINEZ: (AFRAID) It's the Grey One. A legend amongst us. Oldest and most fierce of our kind.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Pieter Stubbe. I didn’t realise how tall he’d be.\nILEANA: (HALF CHOKED) Pieter...\nSTUBBE: Your nameday’s long past, Ileana... but I brought you\nSTUBBE: a@ present anyway.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Turlough!\nINEZ: CWHISPERING) Stay here. Don't move.\nILEANA: I don't want your presents, Pieter. What have you done to my home?\nSTUBBE: Don't take him then. He stuck in my throat too long. I've never tasted worse.\nDOCTOR: (MOVING FORWARD) Turlough. It’s me. Try to breathe slowly.\nDOCTOR: TURLOUGH. (CHOKING) Doctor...\nSTUBBE: What's this? (SNIFFS)\nILEANA: Doctor, go back!\nSTUBBE: Ah, I was told I had a rival.\nDOCTOR: Mr Stubbe, what big eyes you have.\nSTUBBE: They see nothing in you, that’s plain.\nDOCTOR: How very kind. You also have the digestive system of @ power shovel.\nSTUBBE: Nleana, this one stinks of sanctimony like those capuchin friars we devoured on pilgrimage to Rome.\nILEANA: That was not with me.\nSTUBBE: (CHUCKLES) Perhaps not.\nILEANA: The Doctor has my protection. By our laws, he’s in my keeping.\nSTUBBE: We'll see. (BEAT) Well, quite a crowd. I thought they should come to see us off.\nILEANA: I'm not going anywhere.\nSTUBBE: Oh, yes you are. You’ll come back with me. I’ soon put a stop to your cutclaw pretensions.\nLICHTFUSS: Stubbe! Stand away from her. She’s mine!\nSTUBBB: (CHIDING) Neana. Another rival? How you must have missed me. You change lovers as a whore changes petticoats.\nILEANA: Anton, go back.\nLICHTFUSS: You're old, Stubbe. Your legendary days are past. Get back to the old world where you belong.\nSTUBBE: Come closer and say that. (MOCK DODDERING) My ears are not what they were.\nSTUBBE: 62\nILEANA: Anton...\nLICHTFUSS: I said, old wolf, that it’s time to let young blood have its head!\nLICHTFUSS: WHOLE WITH ONE HUGE CHOMPING GULP.\nTLEANA: Anton!\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) Turlough, up you come. Lean on me.\nDOCTOR: FADES INTO THE BACKGROUND AS WE FOLLOW THE PROGRESS OF THE DOGTOR AND TURLOUGH.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 50. THE HOVER TRUCK.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOCTOR: In here, Turlough. Just stay in the truck and stay out of sight.\nTURLOUGH: (WEAK) What am I covered in? Ugh... (COUGHS) My eyes sting.\nDOCTOR: I have to get that unfortunate girl in the jaguar skin away from them.\nTURLOUGH: Rosa?\nDOCTOR: You know her?\nTURLOUGH: I left her behind. When they attacked us.\nTURLOUGH: (PANICKING) Then He came for me. His mouth was opening redder and redder! And then I was drowning in this stinking pit...\nDOCTOR: Turlough. Turlough! I’m here. I’ll get her away too.\nTURLOUGH: (EXHAUSTED) Take this. It’s her knife. She gave it to me.\nDOCTOR: It’s silver.\nTURLOUGH: What is it now?\nDOCTOR: They’re busy again. (ANGRY) This has got to stop. Stay there and don't move.\nDOCTOR: TURLOUGH, No, Doctor. Don’t do anything stupid!\nDOCTOR: FX; TRUCK DOOR SLAMS.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 51. RUINS OF THE RANCH\nSTUBBE: Quiet, you rabble! I’m sick of your commentary. Quiet!\nSTUBBE: Haha. You see? They know their King. Just the\nSTUBBE: instinct to stay alive makes them cheer in all the right places.\nILEANA: You never could exert charm when terror would suffice. Poor, stupid Anton.\nSTUBBE: So much for your string of peccadillos. My strength of will remains implacable. Age and enforced abstinence only make it stronger, my long-lost love. I’ll cut out every rival.\nHAYASHI: Senhora! Please.\nHAYASHI: Go away, Hayashi.\nHAYASHI: But the Doctor. He’s taken Turlough.\nHAYASHI: 63\nDOCTOR: (ARRIVING BACK) I'm right here, Ileana. And I’m taking the girl too.\nILEANA: Leave her, Doctor. She and the boy are mine. (BEAT) But in return for saving my son, I will release Turlough to you.\nSTUBBE: That boy was my gift...\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Deana. Mr ‘Stubbe? I think you've already met Doctor Hayashi\nHAYASHI: You can’t touch me. I’m in the pay of the Senhora.\nDOCTOR: Hayashi, you’d sell your own grandmother if you were offered a good price.\nSTUBBE: Grandmothers? Huh, I had my fill of grandmothers long ago.\nDOSTOR: And did Hayashi tell you about his patent genetic cure for lycanthropy?\nSTUBBE: No. He did not.\nILEANA: What cure? Hayashi?\nHAYASHI: (FLOUNDERING) Well... yes, it’s true. I’ll prove it. Your son... he’s already recovering.\nILEANA: Only because the Doctor stopped your medication. HAYASHI, But it’s my breakthrough. I can end ali your suffering for ever. The Doctor is deliberately hampering my research.\nDOCTOR: Only hampering? I’d gladly wind it up for good.\nDOCTOR: Nleana's people have their own age-old culture and laws. But your research, Hayashi, is nothing short of genocide. I'll fight it. And PU defend every right of the wolf people not to be cured.\nILEANA: And [ll support you, Doctor. HAYASHI. Senhora, this man is a charlatan!\nSTUBBE: (LAUGHS) How you prattle. I’ve had fleas with more\nSTUBBE: sense. J am the oldest of the first-born, spawned out of the slime after the Deluge. Time’s by-ways are mine to prow] and hunt. And all other wolves are my progeny. Humans were raised as my cattle - a right I should have taken long ago. Even for those who deny our heritage.\nILEANA: I won’t come back to you, Pieter. I’m no longer your\nILEANA: consort.\nSTUBBE: Human affectations. ’l take you anyway.\nILEANA: You will not.\nSTUBBE: How can you resist? You’re mine, Ileana. And no one can change that.\nDOCTOR: Pieter Stubbe!\nSTUBBE: Huh?\nILEANA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Stand away from her, Pieter Stubbe. She’s no longer\nDOCTOR: yours. Time’s left you far behind and you’ve lost its scent. You're burnt out. So just give up and go back to the slime you crawled out of.\nHAYASHI: (GLEEFUL) Oh, Doctor. You are such 4, fool.\nSTUBBE: (DEEP AND WARY) Is this a challenge? (SNIFFS) What is he? He's no champion. (DISGUSTED) He’s like that foul- -tasting boy. He’s not even human!\nDOCTOR: Tm the Doctor and I’m offering Deana my protection.\nDOCTOR: I'm stronger and more worthy than any puny human or wolf.\nDOCTOR: 64\nILEANA: Doctor? Before all of us, do you understand the law implicit in your challenge?\nDOCTOR: If I don’t make a stand, your endeavours, (RAISES VOICE) even your people, may be swept aside by this old and monstrous anachronism.\nTLEANA: So be it. From now, Doctor, I withdraw my protection from you. If you prove worthy and truly faithful, (BEAT) then I'll take you as my husband and rejoice in it!\nCLOSING: MUSIC."

(DISGUSTED) He’s like that foul-tasting boy. He’s not even human!\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and I’m offering Neana my protection. I'm stronger and more worthy than any puny human or wolf. (STUBBE GROWLS ANGRILY.}\nILEANA: Doctor? Do you understand the law implicit in your challenge?\nDOCTOR: If I don’t make a stand, your endeavours, (RAISES\nDOCTOR: VOICE) even your people, may be swept aside by this old and monstrous anachronism.\nDOCTOR: ILEAN, So be it. From now I withdraw my protection from you, Dostor. If you prove worthy and truly faithful, (BEAT) then I shall take you as my husband and rejoice in it!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 53. THE HOVER TRUCK.\nTURLOUGH: (TO HIMSELF) Oh Doctor, what are you doing now? You don't stand a chance against that lot. (SEARCHING) Car keys. Must be some sort of ignition.\nTURLOUGH: Who's that?\nVICTOR: (GROGGY GROWL) Who are you? Where’s my mother?\nTURLOUGH: (NERVOUS) Victor? Your mother’s not here. Shouldn’t you be resting?\nVICTOR: (ANGRY) I'm cold without my coat. Where is she!\nVICTOR: SCENE 54.

Truly worthy of her?\nILEANA: Don’t fail me, Doctor. I trust you.\nDOCTOR: (UNCOMFORTABLE) Why Mr Stubbe, what a big, wide, gaping (TRYING TO STAND HIS GROUND) drooling, red mouth you\nDOCTOR: 66\nDOCTOR: have.\nSTUBBE: Ali the better to crunch and gollop you down, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Really? (BEAT) But you wouldn't, would you? I might be too spicy for your jaded palate.\nDOCTOR: What an unadventurous Earth-bound diet. You couldn’t even stomach poor Turlough. And you've already had a heavy day’s eating.\nSTUBBE: (RATTLED) Ileana? What can he give you that I can’t raise a thousandfold?\nILEANA: He gave me my son back.\nSTUBBE: Oh, yes, your son. How touching. It’s plain I left you\nSTUBBE: alone too long.\nILEANA: No, I left you.\nSTUBBE: And now the cutclaws you love so much, have run wild. They’ve trampled our forests to dust. But together we’ll set it right. We’ll herd the cutclaws like the cattle they are. I’ll lay their cities at your feet. Let’s see your worthy champion do that!\nILEANA: Having Victor back is enough.\nVICTOR: (ARRIVING) Mother?\nSTUBBE: Ah, the young cub himself.\nILEANA: Victor. What are you doing? Come here to me.\nVICTOR: I’m cold, mother. I miss my coat.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERING) Turlough, I told you to stay hidden!\nTURLOUGH: I didn’t exactly have a choice.

Yes.\nDOCTOR: “Like one, that on a lonesome road\nDOCTOR: Doth walk in fear and dread,\nDOCTOR: Because he knows, a frightful fiend\nDOCTOR: Doth close behind him tread.”\nDOCTOR: (DEEP BREATH, EXHAUSTED) To know one's enemy, one must first know oneself... Not to worry, Turlough. Thank you. I’m back again.\nTURLOUGH: (RELIEF) I thought for a minute that you'd... I mean, that Stubbe...\nDOCTOR: I'm quite happy with my own coat, thank you. (HALF\nDOCTOR: MOCKING) Surely you know me by now. Why, I’m no more aggressive than Alice’s White Rabbit.\nTUELOUGH: And about as reliable a timekeeper.\nDOCTOR: What!\nTURLOUGH: ..as er, Tegan once said to me.\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED) Did she? How reassuring.\nTURLOUGH: We can't stay here.\nDOCTOR: I agree. Into the hovertruck. Give me a hand with your friend.\nTURLOUGH: CHEFTING HER UP) Come on, Rosa.\nROSA: (HALF ASLEEP) What is it? Grandpa? That you?\nTURLOUGH: (GENTLE) Shush. It’s alright. You're safe now.\nROSA: (SNUGGLING) Oh, Turlough. It’s you. Good. That's okay.\nTURLOUGH: (EMBARRASSED) Erm... I'd introduce you, but..\nFOLLOWED: BY A CHORUS OF HOWLS AND BARKING.\nDOCTOR: Hayashi! (URGENT) That settles it. Back to the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: They move fast. They’ soon catch us up.\nDOCTOR: We'll see. Stubbe’s more a runner than a high-jumper. Altitude is the thorn in his Achilles paw, you might say.\nTURLOUGH: Okay, she’s inside.\nDOCTOR: Right. Let's see if this truck is really airworthy.\nDOCTOR: 1 don’t want another bout with Stubbe. Not until I’m\nDOCTOR: 69\nDOCTOR: ready. Think wonderful thoughts, Turlough. And up we go!\nPX: THE ENGINE STARTS TO REV UP. THE TRUCK TAKES OFF. WE\nHEAR: IT DEPART INTO THE DISTANCE.\nHEAR: SCENE 56. HOVER TRUCK\nHEAR: TURLOUGH. No sign of them down there. Where are they?\nDOCTOR: Look left. At ten o’clock. That cloud of dust.\nTURLOUGH: Is that them? They’re not heading back to the ranch at all. They move so fast.\nDOCTOR: Stubbe obviously considers me less of a threat than I\nDOCTOR: thought. Arrogant really... arrogant of him. They’re heading for the cattle station... and the train.\nTURLOUGH: And the TARDIS. Stubbe said he’d lay whole cities at lleana’s feet.\nDOCTOR: His equivalent of a bunch of flowers, no doubt. The\nDOCTOR: line heads towards Manaus. Odd that. You’d think they’d cause more havoc in Brasilia.\nTURLOUGH: But a pack of werewolves against a whole city. They can’t be that powerful.\nDOCTOR: You've seen how they control people. Even the most\nDOCTOR: advanced civilisations are only an inch away from primal chaos. You can barely shine a moonbeam between the two. As for Stubbe. He’s possibly the deadliest individual this planet has ever produced.\nROSA: Turlough. I want my knife back. (SEES THE VIEW.) dJeeZus! Where’s the ground!\nDOCTOR: This truck is currently cruising at a height of one\nDOCTOR: hundred and twenty feet. How do you do? I’m the Doctor and you’re Turlough’s friend Rosa.\nTURLOUGH: Sit down, Rosa. How are you feeling?\nROSA: Air sick. Did you get me away from the lobos?\nTURLOUGH: Well...\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. The wolves found something less wholesome to chase.\nROSA: Yeah? Grandpa said they always go for the weakest. So give me my knife now, yerpi-boy.\nTURLOUGH: Erm...\nDOCTOR: It's here. Turlough only took it to try and protect you.\nTURLOUGH: That is true.\nROSA: Yeah?\nDOCTOR: I'm glad to hear it. The knife’s chaste silver, isn't it?\nROSA: Only thing that does for Loups-garoux. They hate it.\nTURLOUGH: Like silver bullets?\nDOCTOR: The metal of the moon. That’s an old charm. Lucky\nDOCTOR: you had it, Turlough. Why else do you think Stubbe couldn’t swallow you?\nTURLOUGH: Thanks, Doctor. There’s the monorail. They're at the train already! ne\nTURLOUGH: 70\nDOCTOR: Hold tight. I’m taking her down.\nDOCTOR: SIDEWAYS.\nTURLOUGH: Steady!\nDOCTOR: These things aren’t built for manoeuvres. Now if this was 4 spitfire...\nTURLOUGH: You can’t confront them, Doctor. You said yourself...\nROSA: The train’s moving.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nTURLOUGH: It's going backwards!\nDOCTOR: Back to Rio. I should have known. And there’s no chance of stopping them.\nTURLOUGH: The TARDIS, Doctor.\nROSA: The who?\nDOCTOR: We'll have to follow in this thing.\nTURLOUGH: But we'll never match their speed.\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing!\nDOCTOR: Sorry! Got to stop them somehow!\nTURLOUGH: You'll crash us! DOCTOR!\nROSA: The back of the train...! Look.\nTURLOUGH: The back carriage. It’s broken away!\nDOCTOR: Now how did that happen?\nTURLOUGH: They’ve left it behind. The carriage with the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Nleana. She must have worked it out. That’s very clever. And dangerous for her.\nTURLOUGH: But it’s a chance. She’s giving us a chance to stop them.\nTURLOUGH: SCENE 56a. THE TRAIN\nINEZ: Senhora, the Grey One’s calling for you.\nILEANA: Let him wait, Inez. I had to return that object to the Doctor.\nINEZ: The blue box?\nILEANA: His scent led back to it. It must be important.\nSTUBBE: (DISTANT) Lleana!\nINEZ: (AFRAID) Stubbe’s coming!\nILEANA: No word, Inez! You hear? It’s just a hope, that’s all.\nILEANA: SCENE 87. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM\nROSA: (OUTSIDE DOORS) No way! I ain't going in! Get off me!\nTURLOUGH: We can't leave you out there.\nROSA: (PUSHED IND You’re not locking me up in some\nROSA: Granny (FALTERS) blue... icebox..\nDOCTOB: ‘No. Indeed we are not.\nDOCTOB: OF,\nROSA: (STUNNED) Okay... I mean... Jeez, so big...\nTURLOUGH: Well, that shut her up.\nROSA: What's that?\nTURLOUGH: Just the doors. So we can travel.\nDOCTOR: We have to go to Rio.\nTURLOUGH: She’s got friends in Rio.\nROSA: You're crazy. First it’s lobos. Now it’s locos. So big...\nTURLOUGH: It’s just a different reality. Once you get used to it, it seems like the only reality.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps it’s my reality.\nTURLOUGH: That’s right. And while the outside’s always changing,\nTURLOUGH: some of us are lucky enough to be allowed in here, looking out through a door that’s never in the same place twice.\nROSA: Like in my head. What's inside’s bigger than what's outside.\nTURLOUGH: Your dancing forest.\nROSA: Yeah.\nROSA: & TURLOUGH: Yada yada yada. (THEY LAUGH)\nDEMATERIALISATION: SEQUENCE\nTURLOUGH: Is that what the TARDIS runs on, Doctor? Imagination?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes it certainly has a mind of its own. Shouldn’t you both get cleaned up?\nTURLOUGH: You too, Doctor,\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: Because if you've got a date, you have to make the effort.\nDOCTOR: It's not like that. It's not the end of term dance.\nTURLOUGH: I know. But you’ve still got to look the part. Otherwise she won’t lift a claw to take a second look.\nDOCTOR: (GLUM) If only it were that simple.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 58, TARDIS BEDROOM\nINNER: TARDIS DOOR CLICKS SHUT. CLICK/BEEP OF ROSA'S COMPUTER.\nROSA: Grandpa? Can't talk now. Maybe not for a bit. Too much happening. Can't get my head round it. There’s a whole load of dark. And the lobos are coming out of the shadows. Don't know what’s next up. But there's light too. All round me. Must be full moon already. The wails in this place are all made of moons. S'pose there's other spirits outside the forest? Maybe I found the future. Maybe it found me. But I still got the forest. Still here. And you're here too, Grandpa. Time’s coming\nROSA: when I get to prove myself. 1 won’t forget. (BEAT) See you, Grandpa.\nROSA: SCENE 59. TURLOUGH’S ROOM\nROSA: Ps\nTURLOUGH: Hullo?\nDOCTOR: (UNUSUALLY AWKWARD) Turlough... (BEAT) How are you?\nTURLOUGH: Don't hover, Doctor. Come in.\nDOCTOR: As long as you're not busy.\nTURLOUGH: (PATIENCE) Is there a problem?\nDOCTOR: No, I was just... I seem to... By the way, how did you resist Pieter Stubbe? I mean, his powers of persuasion.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know. I just closed my eyes and thought of...\nDOCTOR: Home?\nTURLOUGH: Weill, thoughts are all I get.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Thank you.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nTURLOUGH: What are you getting yourself into?\nDOCTOR: Sorry?\nTURLOUGH: Heana de Santos. I mean, she’s a wolf. Half a wolf.\nDOCTOR: She chose me. And she gave me back the TARDIS. At considerable risk...\nTURLOUGH: Bui you're not obliged to book a church and a honeymoon. I'd steer well clear.\nDOCTOR: Someone has to stop Pieter Stubbe and never mind\nDOCTOR: the cost. He’s a serious threat. And all because he has to outdo me in Tleana’s affections.\nTURLOUGH: Anh. So it’s your fault.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, and that's another thing...\nTURLOUGH: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Well, I'd hoped... erm, you see, Ileana... Well... since you and Rosa.\nTURLOUGEH: What! Oh, now hang on, Doctor... you're jumping to conclusions... Do you mean... I mean, me? Oh, come on! Me and Rosa?!\nDOCTOR: Well, yes. You see, women... they’re not exactly my\nDOCTOR: area. Apart from Tegan... and Nyssa. But they were... friends. I was responsible for them. That wasn’t the same.\nTURLOUGH: Good friends.\nDOCTOR: And there was SarahwJane of course. And Jo and Romana... both of her. Zoe and Victoria. Dodo and Vicki and Barbara. ‘TURLOUGH: And Susan?\nDOCTOR: Ah well, of course she was my granddaughter. (SIGH) Sometimes I feel very old.\nTURLOUGH: And you think I know better? Look, how do you feel about Ileana?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPS) Now you're getting needlessly personal too.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry. It was you that asked.\nDOCTOR: The important thing is the city. It'll be the height of\nDOCTOR: Carnaval by now. The whole place in an emotional frenzy. And then a train-load of hungry werewolves arrives up from the country. There’lL be no resistance. It'll be like the last round up.\nTURLOUGH: You don’t think His influence is pushing us all a bit over the top?\nDOCTOR: Wo, Turlough, I do not! (GOING OUT) Somehow I dread to think what I'll find when we reach Rio.\nTURLOUGH: Total devastation? A bride? (SIGH) And where does that leave me?\nTURLOUGH: SCENE 60.

My fault.\nROSA: Feels like a storm’s coming.\nDOCTOR: Oppressive. Don’t think about it.\nTURLOUGH: (DISTANT) Doctor, there’s been a car smash.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: Several smashes. All along the street. Where are the emergency services?\nDOCTOR: Everything's gone down together. No one inside this one.\nTURLOUGH: The whole city must be cut off. Something big’s on fire down towards the bay.\nROSA: It’s not real, right? Like you said. It’s like a holodrome park. Thought-surfing ‘gainst the opponent of your choice.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK AS HE CHECKS CARS) No, unfortunately, this is real.\nROSA: CUNEASY) I’m bored. Can’t breathe here. Let’s try some place else.\nTURLOUGH: It’s real, Rosa.\nROSA: It’s better on sat-vid.\nDOCTOR: (COMING BACK) The cars are all empty. I didn’t\nDOCTOR: expect them to clear the crowds quite so efficiently.\nTURLOUGH: (SHIVERS) Can you feel that?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere above the city.\nTURLOUGH: It’s pressing in. It’s in the air, and the buildings. It makes me want to run away.\nDOCTOR: With the herd?\nTURLOUGH: Yes! Anywhere.\nDOCTOR: With all the other humang?\nTURLOUGH: (RELAXING) No. Not humans. You're right. Now who's getting personal?\nDOCTOR: Iam. Remember that. And don’t forget who you\nDOCTOR: 74\nDOCTOR: aren't.\nTURLOUGH: I put my shadow back behind me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. What about Rosa?\nTURLOUGH: Where is she?\nTURLOUGH: FX; ANOTHER DISTANT WOLF HOWL.\nDOCTOR: Always the same with companions. There she goes!\nTURLOUGH: Rosa!\nTURLOUGH: Rosa! Come back!\nTURLOUGH: SCENE 61. RIO - STREET.\nPHONE: CODE ON HER COMPUTER. THE DOCTOR AND TURLOUGH RUN\nDOCTOR: Rosa!\nTURLOUGH: Idiot!\nROSA: (FEVERISH) Get off me! I'm making a call.\nDOCTOR: It isn’t safe out here!\nROSA: Get off! I hate this place! It’s choking my head!\nTURLOUGH: (HOARSE WHISPER) They’re coming!\nROSA: Whoa!\nDOCTOR: Inside here!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 62. SHOP INTERIOR\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR. Quiet, Rosa.\nSILENT: CROWD.\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) What is it? So many people.\nDOCTOR: Don’t move.\nDOCTOR: DRIVES THE CROWD.\nTURLOUGH: Horrible. Look at their faces. They’re mindless.\nDOCTOR: It’s herding them. Like cattle.\nTURLOUGH: Like lambs to the proverbial...\nDOCTOR: All right, Rosa. Ssh.\nTURLOUGH: Get down!\nTURLOUGH: DWINDLE.\nDOCTOR: We have to do something now, before the outside world sends in remote scout cameras and smart troops. We don’t want a full scale stampede on our hands.\nTURLOUGH: That's the last. They’re going.\nTURLOUGH: 75\nDOCTOR: Now where would they corral them? One of the bigger parks?\nUGH: Stay there. I’ find out for you.\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: dust stay put. And no sudden elopements, please.\nDOCTOR: Elopements? Turlough?!\nDOCTOR: Ouch! No need to bite!\nROSA: Serves you right! We gotta stop him!\nDOCTOR: (FIRM) He'll be back soon. Turlough’s grasp of self\nDOCTOR: preservation is second to none. What about you, Rosa? Were you tempted to join the herd?\nROSA: No way!\nDOCTOR: No?\nROSA: No! (BEAT) Anyway, Grandpa says the easy path\nROSA: leads under the falling tree. I ain't climbing on the cattle truck with the rest of them. Did you see their eyes?\nDOCTOR: Grandpa talks a lot of sense.\nROSA: Sometimes. But I don’t reckon he knows everything.\nDOCTOR: What tribe are you? Ticuna? Yanamami?\nROSA: Wuarana. But they're dead now. The forest died, so the others came here.\nDOCTOR: To Rio?\nDOCTOR: FX; TAPS OUT CODE ON HER COMPUTER.\nROSA: But I can’t raise them on the vidlink. That’s dead too.\nDOCTOR: Yes, 'm sorry. What about the forest?\nROSA: Still got it in my head.\nDOCTOR: Always there. Like family.\nROSA: The spirits’ll drive me crazy. But they had to go somewhere. They’re okay about waiting.\nDOCTOR: Tell them it’s better that way. Don’t let them get greedy like Pieter Stubbe.\nROSA: You'd make a good Grandpa, too.\nDOCTOR: Thanks, Rosa. And maybe Turlough shouldn’t be out there on his own.\nROSA: Knew you'd see it right. Stick with me, okay?\nROSA: (MOVES OFF) And let's make tracks.\nROSA: SCENE 63. STREET OUTSIDE PARK\nTRAPPED: INSIDE MAKE FRIGHTENED MOANINGS.\nTURLOUGH: Poor old humans, all caged up in a public park.\nVICTOR: Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: (JUMPS) Hal (PUTTING IT ON AS VICTOR SNUFFLES\nROUND: HIM) Victor, it’s you. You've got the cutclaws well fenced up.\nVICTOR: Where they belong.\nTURLOUGH: Did I miss much? I ran all the way from the ranch.\nVICTOR: You smell of lies. Where’s the Doctor?\nTURLOUGH: Oh, he couldn’t keep up. You know him. All talk and\nTURLOUGH: 76\nTURLOUGH: no action.\nVICTOR: My mother needs him.\nTURLOUGH: Does she? Well, if I see him, I'll tell him. Where is she, by the way?\nVICTOR: Above. With the Grey One. I'll take you there now.\nTURLOUGH: No, I’ll just hang round here for a bit. Keep an eye on\nTURLOUGH: the cutclaws...\nVICTOR: (GROWL) Now! (GRABS TURLOUGH) We run this way.\nVICTOR: SCENE 64. STREET.\nDISTANT: PERSPECTIVE.\nDISTANT: (THE DOCTOR AND ROSA HAVE BEEN WATCHING. SENSE OF URGENCY.)\nROSA: He’s got Turlough. Let me after him. I can outrun any wolf.\nDOCTOR: We'll never catch them that way. I've wasted too\nDOCTOR: much time already.\nROSA: Where’re you going?\nDOCTOR: Back to the TARDIS.\nROSA: But Turlough...\nDOCTOR: Victor said “above.” What's above the city, but still close to the Earth?\nROSA: Doctor, wait.\nDOCTOR: Must be the Corcovado. The Christ statue. That's where we first sensed Stubbe’s presence.\nROSA: (FURIOUS) Doctor! Are you listening?\nROSA: Turlough’s no fighter. One wrong move and he’s capybara curry.\nDOCTOR: He has his moments. What's more important, Rosa?\nDOCTOR: One young man? Or a whole city - blown out of its wits by the storm force of Pieter Stubbe’s will.\nROSA: (UNNERVED) Stubbe?\nDOCTOR: And not just the humans. I don’t imagine his wolfish cohorts had any say in the matter either. That’s what I have to break. (GOING THOUGH HIS POCKETS) Now where did I put that...?\nROSA: (DETERMINED) I still got a date with that lobo king.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Knew I had it somewhere.\nROSA: A whistle? You crazy?\nDOCTOR: This dog whistle belonged to a faithful friend of mine.\nROSA: And blowing it’ll bring every varmint for miles down on us.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. And it'll give Stubbe's pack the shuffle it so\nDOCTOR: richly deserves.\nDOCTOR: THE RIGHT. AND ANOTHER IN THE CENTRE.\nDOCTOR: TH\nDOCTOR: SCENE 65, SUMMIT OF THE CORCOVADO\nBETWEEN: HIS TEETH.\nSTUBBE: (MOUTH FULL) You're not eating, Deana.\nILEANA: (COLD) You never stop.\nSTUBBE: The cutclaws are plumper these days. Remember the Grand Duchess Anastasia?\nILEANA: And Lord Lucan.\nSTUBBE: Skinny as church wafers. (CRUNCH) But these bones\nSTUBBE: (SPITS) Brittle as twigs.\nHOWLS: REACH UP FROM THE CITY BELOW.\nSTUBBE: What's that rumpus?\nTLEANA: (QUIET EXCITEMENT) It’s the Doctor. He must be down in the city already.\nSTUBBE: Never.\nSTUBBE: Your precious champion won’t dare show his snout. Smell that air. The scent of fear rising up from the city. Remember Moscow.\nILEANA: Old times, long gone.\nSTUBBE: TI won’t ask you again, Deana.\nILEANA: I will not be your consort. Never.\nSTUBBE: (ANGRY) I've given you what you wanted. All the wolves brought together.\nILEANA: Reduced to a limp-tailed mob cringing under your tyranny.\nSTUBBE: Careful. Or I'l] turn that will on you too.\nILEANA: You already have.\nSTUBBE: (DISTASTE) There is a scent. What is it?\nILEANA: (RELIEF) It is him. The Doctor.\nVICTOR: (ARRIVING) Mother.\nVICTOR: ILEANA. (DISAPPOINTED) Victor.\nSTUBBE: Well, the cub comes on leaps and bounds. What have\nSTUBBE: you fetched us, boy?\nVICTOR: He was slinking round the cattle pens.\nILEANA: Turlough.\nSTUBBE: Ugh, that pastey, vinegar-veined youth. I'll never get Tid of the taste!\nILEANA: Turlough, where’s the Doctor?\nTURLOUGH: (EXHAUSTED) The Doctor?\nILEANA: ‘Yes. I knew he’d come for me. Where is he? Victor, go back down and look.\nTURLOUGH: (CONTEMPT) Don’t imagine the Doctor's going to defend you now.\nILEANA: What? What do you mean?\nTURLOUGH: Not after what you've done. He’s very particular\nTURLOUGH: 78\nTURLOUGH: about who he travels with.\nTURLOUGH: SCENE 66. STREET\nINCLUDING: INEZ.\nROSA: You still think this was a good idea?\nDOCTOR: dust edge up to the TARDIS door... and keep that knife out of sight. (TO CROWD) My friends. How good it is to see you come when you're called. First to Pieter Stubbe’s will. And then to my whistle. Splendid stuff.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure that Pieter Stubbe knows best, because he’s an honourable wolf. So it’s good to see you out in the open, not skulking behind your own shadows.\nINEZ: Stubbe promised us our age-old rights.\nDOCTOR: Inez, you don't sound too sure. Not to worry. Stubbe's a good fellow. He'll have it all in hand. So tell me, how will you manage to feed and water the cutclaw herds? The stupid creatures can't look after themselves. And what about the human troops, when they roll up to take back their city?\nINEZ: Stubbe said he’d lead us.\nDOCTOR: From up on the hill. Loosing his dogs of war against smart weapons and wolf-seeking missiles? How magnanimous of him. You used to run free and choose for yourselves, but now he does it for you.\nROSA: Watch it, Doctor. They’re turning nasty.\nDOCTOR: That’s the idea. (ALOUD) Soon you won’t have to think at all. Soon you’ll be nothing but a kennel full of the honourable Pieter Stubbe’s lapdog poodles!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 67. SUMMIT OF THE CORCOVADO\nOSTUBBE: Now what do the rabble want?\nILEANA: They want to run free. Turlough, where’s the Doctor?\nTURLOUGH: Far away by now.\nILEANA: Don’t lie to me. He wouldn't leave you behind.\nSTUBBE: If that’s all the Doctor wants, let’s throw the boy\nSTUBBE: down the mountain to him.\nTURLOUGH: No. Put me down! Please!\nTURLOUGEH: Doctor!\nILEANA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Pieter Stubbe! When I challenge you, you will have\nDOCTOR: the decency to stay and face me!\nSTUBBE: Challenges I accept. Not taunts. What is that object?\nSTUBBE: 79\nSTUBBE: More moonshine?\nDOCTOR: Tleana, thank you for returning my TARDIS.\nTLEANA: I understood that it was important.\nDOCTOR: It is.\nSTUBBE: Important? It’s just delusion. Just like you, Doctor.\nSTUBBE: You don’t belong here. Not in our world. You're the rea] monster. And just as full of tricks as a tar pit.\nDOCTOR: And you're bowling on a sticky wicket, Pieter. Turlough, get inside the TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: Be careful, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That's the last thing I can do. Pieter Stubbe, I challenge you...\nSTUBBE: Yes, monster? Now what?\nDOCTOR: You will relinquish the power you've seized. Release\nDOCTOR: the people you've enslaved, both wolves and humans. F I hold sway here. In just one tiny city. Ri Not for long. There are many more wolves to be found and unleashed. Just as I did with her.\nDOCTOR: Stop it now, Pieter, before the others turn on you.\nDOCTOR: Listen to them. They're turning already.\nSTUBBE: This is your doing. (MOVING AWAY) I'll soon stop their whining.\nTHIS: DRAWS BACK AS WE MOVE To...\nTHIS: SCENE 68. INSIDE TARDIS DOORWAY\nTHIS: STUBBE.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor’s getting in too deep. We may have to distract that monster, Rosa. Where’s your computer?\nROSA: (HALF DELIRIOUS) My fight... The spirits are getting angry...\nTURLOUGH: . (CONCERNED) Rosa?\nROSA: (ECHOING) It’s my goddamn fight.\nROSA: STUBBE, (LIKEWISE) I'll be waiting ...round the next corner. ROSA. Grandpa? I can’t...\nSTUBBE: And Pll still be hungry.\nROSA: Grandpa!\nROSA: SNARL OF THE ROSA/CAT AGAIN. SNAP! BACK IN THE TARDIS.\nTURLOUGH: . Rosa. Don’t give in. Where’s your computer? I need {\nFR: ROSA MAKES A LOW GROWLING CAT YOWL.\nFR: SCENE 69. SUMMIT OF THE CORCOVADO.\nSTUBBE: (BACKGROUND) Listen to me, you rabble. I’m your\nSTUBBE: 80\nSTUBBE: king. Lord of the forests! I won’t be denied!\nILEANA: (QUIETLY) Doctor? When you travel, what do you lock for?\nDOCTOR: That's easy. I explore possibilities. I look for things I\nDOCTOR: could never imagine. I want to know how they work and perhaps help them work better.\nILEANA: And you share that.\nDOCTOR: With my companions, yes.\nSTUBBE: (STILL IN BACKGROUND) Don’t turn your backs on me!\nDOCTOR: Some people call it meddling. Others actually thank me for it. It all depends which side they’re on.\nSTUBBE: You pack of mange-ridden curs! I know who you’ve been listening to!\nILEANA: Doctor, I could be more than just a companion.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, are you coming back...\nDOCTOR: I said, into the TARDIS, Turlough!\nSTUBBE: CAPPROACHING) Doctor! Turn my brood against me, would you?\nILEANA: Leave him, Pieter! I’ve made my choice. I will not come back to you.\nSTUBBE: (LAUGHS) What? Go with him? Did he whistle for you too?\nTLEANA: He’s not an animal like you.\nDOCTOR: Now hang on...\nSTUBBE: Does he know what you really are?\nILEANA: He’s seen my dark side.\nDOCTOR: Tleana’s already told me.\nSTUBBE: That old story about the merchant’s daughter rescued\nSTUBBE: from bandits? She likes a good tale.\nILEANA: No, Pieter. Don’t!\nSTUBBE: You don’t want her sort, Doctor.\nILEANA: No!\nSTUBBE: Eighteen twelve. The French were fleeing Moscow. I caught her in the snow, filthy and starving, hunched over a frozen corpse. So hungry she’d eat anything. The wolf bitch shone through her like glass, And now, centuries later, after everything I taught her, she still doesn’t know if she’s woman or wolf.\nDOCTOR: I can't judge her.\nTLEANA: Doctor. You accept me? (EXULTANT) Then I shall go with you.\nDOCTOR: CVERY QUIET, VERY SAD) No.\nILEANA: Yes, I shall. You already said...\nDOCTOR: Tleana, I would value your companionship...\nSTUBBE: (LAUGHS) He can’t take you. He’s an outsider. That’s his dark side.\nILEANA: We're all outsiders.\nDOCTOR: Pieter’s right. I can't take you. You’re tied to the\nDOCTOR: Earth. To its old bones. To leave would kill you.\nDOCTOR: al\nILEANA: (ANGRY) I thought you'd be here with mel\nDOCTOR: Tleana. ;\nSTUBBE: He could be. He could give up his travels to stay. Couldn't you, Doctor?\nSTUBBE: ILEANA, Would you stay, Doctor? For me? Do you really care?\nDOCTOR: Look to your army, Stubbe. It’s your blood they want.\nSTUBBE: Let them howl.\nILEANA: Doctor? (BEAT)\nDOCTOR: Ileana, perhaps I care much too much.\nILEANA: Or not enough. (DEFEATED) Goodbye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Tleana!\nSTUBBE: Tleana! You’re mine!\nILEANA: Let go of me!\nDOCTOR: Put her down, Stubbel\nSTUBBE: She’s mine. She can’t resist. Neither can you, Doctor. Nothing can!\nDOCTOR: Your wolves reject you, Stubbe! Let her go!

I can’t feel the world.\nDOCTOR: Of course, you can’t. But you can see it. Look, there it is. It’s going away from you.\nSTUBBE: Take me back! Monster!

It’s left you behind.\nSTUBBE: So cold...\nDOCTOR: Or were you too busy gorging to listen? You can’t devour it all, Pieter. The Earth’s bigger than you are. Perhaps you’ve had your fill.\nTURLOUGH: He’s not changing, Doctor. Surely he’ll become human.\nDOCTOR: There were no humans when he first appeared.\nSTUBBE: I’m the first. All Loups-garoux are my children.\nROSA: (POSSESSED) Out of the forests, that’s where you came from.\nTURLOUGH: Rosa?\nSTUBBE: (WEAKER) They destroyed the forests. They drove us out.\nROSA: Stop whining! I am the forest. You left me. And now I’m coming after you.\nSTUBBE: The girl in the cat skin. Your claws still need cutting.\nROSA: Should have eaten me when you had the chance.\nDOCTOR: What shall we do with him, Rosa?\nROSA: Dunno. His strength’s sapping away. But he'll always be hungry.\nSTUBBE: (VERY WEAK) Where’s Ileana? Tell her I'll behave. Just take me back.\nDOCTOR: His people have rejected him. Even Ileana doesn’t want him. And neither do L\nTURLOUGH: You can't let him go.\nDOCTOR: No, we can’t do that.\nROSA: He’s trouble, But I know who’ll have him,\nDOCTOR: Your spirits. I hoped you'd say that.\nDOCTOR: 83\nROSA: Pieter Stubbe? Listen to me. Look. Do you see the path? Can you smell it?\nSTUBBE: (GRUNTS) What’s that?\nROSA: The path... ahead of you, through the trees.\nSTUBBE: The path...\nROSA: Go on. Follow the path. Straight ahead.\nROSA: SCENE 70a.

We can’t leave him lying there.\nDOCTOR: Just open the doors, please.\nDOCTOR: OUTSIDE.\nTURLOUGH: You'll need a fork-lift truck to move him.\nDOCTOR: Shush. Wolves have ears.\nTURLOUGH: (MUTTERING) Or a wheelbarrow...\nTURLOUGH: 84\nDOCTOR: I think he should be returned to his own people. Then they can all go home.\nDOCTOR: I'll handle that. Bye, Doctor... Grandpa says he’s Sorry. ‘he missed you.\nDOCTOR: Tell him the forest’s in safe hands. Goodbye, Rosa.\nTURLOUGH: Rosa? I suppose your initiation’s finished.\nROSA: Hardly started.

At what price, when I can never leave the Earth?\nILEANA: 85\nDOCTOR: No, I never wanted to stay at home either. That story. The one about the wolf woman and the winter. How did it end?
