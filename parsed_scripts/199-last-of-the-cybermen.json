You didn’t really believe that, did you, Jamie?\nJAMIE: Well, of course I — (REALISATION) What, he was lying?\nZOE: There’s no sort of navigational adjustment he couldn’t make from inside the TARDIS.

He’s safe, thank goodness.\nJAMIE: Safe?! — He’s not safe, Zoe!\nZOE: (MILD REBUKE) Jamie. He’s five minutes away, if that.\nJAMIE: That’s not the point.

There was a flash of lightning, and then — then he was gone...\nJAMIE: You’re sayin’ he was struck by lightning?\nZOE: I hope not.\nJAMIE: That settles it. —\nJAMIE: You’d best stay here, Zoe.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 4\nZOE: I’1l do no such thing, Jamie McCrimmon!\nJAMIE: Now listen here — (RECONSIDERS) Och, what’s the use?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 5\nJAMIE: SCENE 3: EXT.

I was running. I stubbed my toe. Then, in a flash, I was here.\nZOE: Yes. You fell.\nDOCTOR: No, no, the fall came after.\nZOE: Are you sure you didn’t hit your head?\nDOCTOR: I was in a wood. I was running. I stubbed my toe... on a root, I remember !\nJAMIE: (COMING OVER) Is he alright?\nZOE: I think he’s had a bang on the head.\nDOCTOR: I did not bang my head! I am neither concussed, delirious, nor am I delusional!\nJAMIE: Aye, well, seeing as you’re so alright — we’re looking for the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 9\nZOE: You know our names, you must know the Doctor.\nJAMIE: We saw him, on the scanner. Running over yonder ridge.\nDOCTOR: (REMEMBERING) Running...\nZOE: There was a flash of lightning, then he was gone. He must have fallen.\nDOCTOR: Fallen where?\nZOE: (BEGINNING TO REALISE) Here. He fell here. Oh, Jamie — I think...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I appear to have swapped places with your Doctor. I was running. Your Doctor was running. There was a flash of lightning...\nZOE: Then you were here.\nDOCTOR: Wherever here is.\nJAMIE: Aye, the Doctor didn’t say.\nZOE: A dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, going by the stars.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) That’s my Zoe.\nZOE: ‘My’ Zoe...?\nJAMIE: Never mind where here is, where’s the Doctor?!\nZOE: Wherever this man was, I expect.\nDOCTOR: It would appear that I’ve been translocated in time and space, yes.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 10\nZOE: Perhaps you’1ll just switch back?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. Or perhaps there’s a more sinister explanation.

Weren’t you listening?\nJAMIE: I was, only all the talkin’ flew right over my thick head.\nZOE: I don’t know how, but this is the Doctor.\nJAMIE: Och, don’t be ridiculous. Look at his face!\nZOE: You told me he changed his face once before.\nJAMIE: That’s only somethin’ Polly told me. Always teasin’ me, she was.\nDOCTOR: Your face changed, Jamie.\nJAMIE: Eh?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: In the Land of Fiction, remember? I had to reassemble you, from a puzzle.\nZOE: Only you got the face all wrong!\nDOCTOR: To my eternal mortification. — Now please, we need to hurry.\nDOCTOR: OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE, UNNOTICED. SCRABBLING ON SCREE.\nJAMIE: Why’re you in such a hurry, eh? You want to know what I think? I think, we saw the Doctor running. I think, he was running from you. I think, you’ve knocked him out and you’ve hidden him somewhere, and now you want to away and steal the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Old friend, I realise how all of this must sound, but [nonetheless]\nZOE: (INTERRUPTING — SHE’S SEEN SOMETHING) You’re wrong, Jamie...!\nJAMIE: Eh?\nZOE: The Doctor wasn’t running from him. (ALARM) He was running from that!\nLANKY: (ABOVE, ON RIDGE) Stop!\nJAMIE: A Cyberman-?!\nZOE: It must have been coming up from the other side of the ridge, all the time we’ve been talking.\nJAMIE: (TO DOCTOR) Say it, then. If you’re the Doctor, say it!\nDOCTOR: Say what-?\nLANKY: (ABOVE; HALTING, TIRED) Don’t run. You mustn’t run.\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 12\nJAMIE: See? He knows you.\nLANKY: Know him. Yes.\nDOCTOR: The other side of the gully’s too steep, we’ll never outpace ais\nJAMIE: If that’s the case, I know just what the Doctor’d do: (FX: GRABS A ROCK FROM GROUND) “Bung a rock at it!” (EFFORT; THROWS ROCK)\nLANKY: Aah!\nDOCTOR: Be serious, Jamie.\nJAMIE: (FX: GRABS ANOTHER ROCK) When I say “bung” .. bung!

That’s how the Doctor would have dealt with it.\nZOE: “Please.” It said “please”.\nDOCTOR: I noticed.\nJAMIE: So?\nZOE: Oh, Jamie. Have you ever known a Cyberman say “Please”? — Come on. (CLAMBERS UP OPPOSING RIDGE)\nJAMIE: Och, where’s she going now?\nZOE: (OFF, CLAMBERING) I want to take a look at it.\nDOCTOR: So do I.

By the sounds o’ that drop, it’ll have been broken into pieces!\nZOE: (CLIMBING) Oh, Jamie — where’s your curiosity?\nJAMIE: (FROM BELOW) All I want is to find the Doctor and have us away from this wretched place!\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING OVER TOP) Keep going, Zoe. I’m right behind you.\nZOE: One last heave — (EFFORT)\nJAMIE: (FROM BELOW) Well? Can you see anything?\nZOE: I don’t believe it...!\nJAMIE: (FROM BELOW) Believe what? Zoe?\nZOE: You need to see! Both of you!\nDOCTOR: (LAST EFFORT; STRAIGHTENS UP) Now, what’s this something unb— [elievable] (BREAKS OFF) Gracious me.\nZOE: Isn’t it amazing?\nDOCTOR: I’ve never seen anything like it.\nJAMIE: (CLIMBING UP, BELOW) Like what?\nZOE: It’s a head. A giant Cyberman head, at the top of a mountain! Why, it must be five hundred feet high!\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 15\nJAMIE: Och, you mean the head’s five hundred feet.\nZOE: (SHIVER) With the lightning on it, the eyes look almost alive.\nJAMIE: What is it, d’you suppose? A monument of some sort? Like a statue?\nDOCTOR: Cybermen don’t build monuments.\nZOE: They don’t say “Please”, either. But that one did. Which reminds me... (LOOKING BELOW)\nJAMIE: You’re not still after your metal friend?\nZOE: (SCANNING) It’s a long way down. Too dark to see.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, the Doctor’s bound to have brought his Everlasting Matches. Isn’t that right, “Doctor”?\nDOCTOR: (SEARCHING POCKETS) No... but I do have a torch.\nZOE: Give it here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (PASSING TORCH) Careful of the edge, Zoe. It doesn’t look [stable. ]\nLANKY: (20 FEET BELOW) Please...\nJAMIE: Did you hear that?\nZOE: Down there, see? It’s damaged, but it’s still alive! (CALLING) Do you need help?\nLANKY: Help. Yes...\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 16\nLANKY: THROUGHOUT.\nJAMIE: What’s that racket it’s making?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no! — It’s a distress signal. It’s activated a distress signal.\nJAMIE: What — more Cybermen will be coming here?\nDOCTOR: From that Cyber-citadel? Very possibly.\nZOE: Citadel?!\nDOCTOR: I told you, Cybermen don’t build monuments.\nJAMIE: Come on, let’s get out of here!\nZOE: It said “Please”. It asked for our help! We can’t just leave it!\nJAMIE: So, it said “Please”. So what? Mebbe it’s some kind of idiot Cyberman, with half of its screws loose. But if that thing’s bringing a citadel-ful of its friends down on us, we don’t want to be here — Am I right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He’s right, Zoe. We should get back to the TARDIS, right now!\nZOE: Alright. (CALLING DOWN) I’m sorry, Mr Cyberman. We have to go n— [ooow.] (WOBBLES, BREAKS OFF AS SHE SLIPS ON SCREE)\nJAMIE: Zoe!

Your leg’s trapped under a rock.\nLANKY: Can't... move.\nZOE: (EXAMINING IT) I thought you lot were supposed to have the strength of ten men.\nLANKY: Please...\nZOE: If I try to shift it — you won’t hurt me, will you?\nLANKY: No.\nZOE: Do you promise?\nLANKY: Yes.\nZOE: Cybermen don’t make promises, that’s what the Doctor would Say.

D’you suppose he’s taken her?\nDOCTOR: It’s an explanation.\nJAMIE: Well, where to? — Not yon Cyber-citadel1!\nDOCTOR: We'll have to go after her. — Come on, we need to belay this rope.\nJAMIE: (UNCOILING ROPE) This is all your fault. If you hadn’t insisted on going off out of the TARDIS alone —\nDOCTOR: Then you do accept I’m the Doctor?\nJAMIE: (NON-COMMITALLY) Mebbe.\nDOCTOR: Well, I can hardly be held responsible for the manifold idiocies of my former incarnations.\nJAMIE: Hey, are you calling my Doctor an idiot?\nDOCTOR: Heading off to explore a Cybermen citadel alone? I’d call that pretty idiotic.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, he must have had a reason.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: Yes. — Yes, I suppose I must...\nJAMIE: Och, you can’t remember, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: No, I can’t. Which is something of a worry.\nJAMIE: Old age, aye.\nDOCTOR: No! — I mean, I can believe that I went out to have a look around, then got chased back to the TARDIS by a Cyberman...\nJAMIE: Happens all the time.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. But if Zoe had got herself kidnapped by a Cyberman, and taken to a giant Cyber-citadel.. well, I’m sure I’d have remembered that.\nAPPROACHING: FAST, FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CITADEL.\nJAMIE: So?\nDOCTOR: So.. what if none of this would have happened, if your Doctor hadn’t been translocated?\nJAMIE: So you’re sayin’ it is all your fault n—[ow?] (BREAKS OFF,\nHEARING: HELICOPTER-LIKE FLYER; ROTORS) Hey, do you hear that?\nDOCTOR: Jamie, behind you!\nJAMIE: Whuh-?

It’d be better if you talked.\nZOE: I rescued you. I helped you out when you were trapped, and what thanks do I get? I get seized — rather roughly seized, I might add —\nLANKY: Sorry. I don’t know me own strength sometimes.\nZOE: . seized, and dragged off to this citadel to be interrogated by — (BREAKS OFF) Did you just say “sorry”?\nLANKY: Please, Ms Zennox. This girl Zoe has shown us only kindness. Let’s give her the benefit.\nZENNOX: She tried to repair what she thought was a Cyberman, we’re right to be suspicious.\nZOE: I made him better because he said “please”. What kind of Cyberman says “please”, and “sorry”, and talks about kindness?\nLANKY: You’re right... Zoe. I’m not a Cyberman.\nFRANK: (WALKING IN THROUGH DOOR) Not where it matters, at least.\nZENNOX: Captain Frank! Did you recover the girl’s associates?\nFRANK: Of course.\nZOE: The Doctor and Jamie! Where are they?\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 31\nFRANK: Had to give them a blast of Hermione’s knockout ray. Shut ‘em up in a storeroom so they could sleep it off.\nZENNOX: Why? Did they try to attack you?\nFRANK: Great Jupiter, no. I was trying to stop them killing each other, in fact.\nZOE: Don’t tell me they were fighting!\nFRANK: Slugging it out like a pair of burned-out mek-boxers, right on the edge of a rock face. Don’t worry — I’ve put ‘em in plasti- cuffs. For their own safety, of course.\nZOE: Oh no. — They’re friends, really they are.\nLANKY: “Priends”?\nZOE: It’s hard to explain.\nLANKY: I told you, I’m not a Cyberman... lass.\nFRANK: Lanky here knows all about friends. We’re best chums, him and I — isn’t that right, Lanky?\nLANKY: The Captain and me, we were comrades-in-arms. Fighter pilots, in the Great Cyber-War. I were shot down in the skies above Telos, and taken for Cyber-conversion. The Captain went back for me, though.\nFRANK: Pulled him out of the machinery — er, just before those monsters converted his brain.\nLANKY: (JUTTING IN) Too late to save the rest of me, mind.\nZOE: But still, he went back for you.\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 32\nLANKY: Sticking by your mates through thick and thin, that’s friendship.\nFRANK: Now, now, old chap. Let’s not get sentimental.\nZENNOX: Yes, we wouldn’t want him leaking oil.\nZOE: So there are no real Cybermen here? Bad Cybermen. Oh, you know what I mean.\nLANKY: Where’ve you been, lass?\nZENNOX: The Cybermen were utterly defeated, ten Earth years ago.\nFRANK: Those tin terrors never stood a chance, not once the Johnnies in Space Ordnance had come up with the Glittergun.\nZOE: Glittergun?\nZENNOX: It turned out that a design flaw in the Cybermen’s respiratory apparatus made them vulnerable to gold dust.\nZOE: Really?\nLANKY: So if you’re wearing any jewellery, you stay away from me!\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 33\nLANKY: SCENE 15: INT. STOREROOM\nJAMIE: Careful, eh?\nDOCTOR: I can be trusted with the simplest task, you know. —\nJAMIE: Ah, that’s better. — I’1l have my dirk back now, if you don’t mind.\nDOCTOR: With pleasure. (HANDS IT OVER)\nJAMIE: (TAKING DIRK BACK) Good. (FX: AS DOCTOR CROSSES TO DOOR:) You surely don’t think that door’1ll just open?\nDOCTOR: (FX: LIFTING METAL FLAP) Looks like the mechanism is triggered by a small electrical charge...\nJAMIE: What, an electric key?\nDOCTOR: Like the low charge that Cybermen generate.\nJAMIE: We’re in that Cyber-citadel, then?\nDOCTOR: I'd have thought so, wouldn’t you?\nJAMIE: Bet you’re wishing you had your sonic screwdriver now.\nDOCTOR: All I need’s a few amps to trip it. The battery from my torch would have done it.\nJAMIE: Aye, but you don’t have that, either.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: These “wee metal boxes...”\nJAMIE: Hey, is there something inside there?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nJAMIE: Give it a shake, then.\nJAMIE: CYBERMAT’S ANTENNAE TWITCHING, BUT SHOULDN’T BE IDENTIFIABLE).\nJAMIE: See? That was electric!\nDOCTOR: Electronic. I wonder what it’s for?\nJAMIE: Who cares? Just get it open. (BEAT) Oh, right. No sonic screwdriver.\nDOCTOR: (MISERABLY) No.\nJAMIE: Give it here.\nDOCTOR: (HANDING IT OVER) Brute force won’t help.\nJAMIE: I may be a brute, but I’m a brute with a dirk — aye? Now:\nJAMIE: let’s see if we can’t get this wee box open...\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 35\nJAMIE: SCENE 16: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nZOE: . I promise you, we’re just travellers. We didn’t come here for any reason. — Why, did you?\nLANKY: Course we did, [lass]\nZENNOX: (WARNING) Corporal...!\nLANKY: Sorry, Ms Zennox.\nFRANK: Loose lips, old scout.\nZOE: Well, I warn you — if you’re planning on doing something stupid, like reviving the Cybermen...\nFRANK: Revive the Cybermen?! Why would we want to —\nZENNOX: Oh, I see. Our young friend is labouring under the misapprehension that this is a Cybermen tomb.\nZOE: It isn’t?\nLANKY: No!\nZENNOX: The citadel stands on solid bedrock. There are no sub-surface chambers. No hibernating army underground.\nZOE: Well, that’s a relief. — What is it, then?\nFRANK: There’s the mystery.\nZOE: (CROSSING FLOOR, STUDYING CONTROL ARRAY) I take it this grand array is the master control for the entire citadel?\nZENNOX: So far, we've opened up all of the ground floor. The higher levels remain... inaccessible.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 36\nZOE: Locked, you mean?\nFINDEL: (RUSHING IN) Curatrix! Curatrix! I’ve got it! I’ve worked it all out!\nZENNOX: Worked all what out, Findel?\nFINDEL: The gate, Ms Zennox, the gate! It’s — (BREAKS OFF; SEES ZOE) Who’s this?\nZOE: ‘This’ is Zoe.\nZENNOX: One of three spaceniks, apparently.\nFINDEL: She doesn’t look like a spacenik.\nFRANK: No, but her friends do.\nZOE: They do not! — Well, maybe a bit. (REALISATION) ‘Curatrix’!\nZENNOX: Yes.\nZOE: I know what you are. You’re with a museum! You’re collecting for a museum!\nLANKY: Sharp one, isn’t she?\nZENNOX: My assistant Findel and I are on sabbatical from the Interplanetary War Museum, yes.\nZOE: What about the Captain, and, uh...\nLANKY: Call me Lanky, everybody else does.\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 37\nZOE: Of course, because you’re so tall.\nLANKY: Because I’m from Lancashire.\nZOE: Oh!\nZENNOX: They flew us here, of course.\nFRANK: Lanky and I — we were both retired.\nLANKY: Demobilised. Decommissioned. Scrapped!\nFRANK: But if you need a couple of aerial daredevils to get you through to the heart of the Kuiper Belt — we’re your chaps.\nZENNOX: You were saying, Findel? Something about a gate?\nFINDEL: Well, I was just writing up those interior measurements, like you asked, when suddenly it struck me — the control panel here, we know it uses symbolic logic...\nZENNOX: All Cyber-technology is based on symbolic logic.\nFINDEL: Yes, but the gate itself, the logic gate. What if it’s not an OR gate, like in the Cybermen tombs, but a NOR gate?\nZENNOX: A NOR gate...?\nZOE: There are three types of logic gates: AND, OR and NOR. They each describe a [different]\nZENNOX: I know about logic gates, thank you!\nZOE: He’s wrong, though. You can tell just by looking at the control array. NOR to NOR to NOR and so on excludes every outcome.\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 38\nFINDEL: Oh! Yes, I suppose it does. But it’s not an OR gate, either.\nZOE: So it’s something more complicated. A sequence.\nFINDEL: But there must be any number of possibilities!\nZOE: Only a few million. Look — you let my friends out, and I’11l narrow it down. If you like.\nFRANK: She seems to know what she’s talking about.\nZOE: Well, yes. I am a genius.\nLANKY: Modest, too.\nZOE: (PUT OUT) No, really. I’m a genius.\nZENNOX: Alright. Open up the other levels, and we’ll let your friends\nZENNOX: go.\nZOE: I said to let my friends go first.\nZENNOX: I know.\nFINDEL: Well, look — if she’s got two friends, why not let one of them\nFINDEL: out now, as a show of good faith? Then the other one later.\nFRANK: Seems reasonable.\nZOE: I suppose so.\nZENNOX: Go on, Captain. Fetch one of them from the storeroom.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 39\nFINDEL: (ALARMED) The storeroom? You’ve locked them in the storeroom?\nFRANK: Yes, why?\nFINDEL: Well, did you check the traps?\nFRANK: Traps?\nFINDEL: Little metal boxes. There were signs of infestation in there, that’s why I put down traps.\nZOE: ‘Infestation’? — What do you mean, ‘infestation’?\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 40\nZOE: SCENE 17: INT. STOREROOM\nDOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. It can’t be that hard.\nJAMIE: This metal’s super-strong. I don’t want to break my dirk.\nDOCTOR: Just give it some Caledonian muscle!\nJAMIE: It’s not a question of muscle, it’s —\nJAMIE: That’s got it!\nDOCTOR: At last!\nJAMIE: Hey, there’s something moving inside!\nDOCTOR: Moving...?\nJAMIE: (REALISATION) Och, no. Doctor, get right back against the wall.\nDOCTOR: Why? What is it?\nJAMIE: ‘Cos there’s no sense both of us getting bitten, is there?\nDOCTOR: Bitten? Jamie, what’s in there? Show me!\nJAMIE: Och, it’s crawlin’ out onto my hand!\nDOCTOR: A Cybermat!\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 41\nJAMIE: What was that-?\nDOCTOR: Ah. There’s a grate in the wall.\nJAMIE: There’s more of them!\nDOCTOR: Coming through the grate. Our friend here must have signalled the rest of the pack.\nJAMIE: Pack?!?\nJAMIE: Doctor, they’re surroundin’ us!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and I’m afraid there’s no way out!\nDOCTOR: END OF EPISODE ONE\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR: EPISODE TWO\nJAMIE: Doctor, they’re surrounding us!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and I’m afraid there’s no way out!\nDOCTOR: SCENE CONTINUES:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18: INT. STOREROOM/CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nJAMIE: Och, like things couldn’t get any worse!\nLANKY: Into the corridor. Quickly!\nDOCTOR: You heard the man, Jamie!\nJAMIE: The Cyber-man!\nFRANK: (HALTS OUTSIDE DOOR) Fella’s not what you think! — Move!\nJAMIE: Well, who the devil [are you?]\nDOCTOR: Jamie, come on!\nFRANK: Lanky, the door!\nCYBERMATS: — ALTHOUGH ONE REMAINS ON JAMIE'S SLEEVE.\nDOCTOR: That was close.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 43\nJAMIE: Out of the fire into the fryin’ pan, more like.\nFRANK: Oh, lord. Lanky — there’s a Cybermat still on the lad’s sleeve.\nJAMIE: What? — Och no, I’d forgotten about him!\nLANKY: Allow me.\nLANKY: — LITTLE ELECTRONIC SQUEAL?\nJAMIE: Well, what’re you gonna do with it now?\nLANKY: Alright?\nJAMIE: Squashin’s one way of dealing with it, aye.\nFRANK: Pesky little blighter, place is full of ‘em. They’re only here for maintenance — but they’1l give you a nasty nip if they get half a chance.\nDOCTOR: We’re well aware of that — Captain.\nJAMIE: Captain?\nDOCTOR: Insignia on his flying jacket, Jamie — which tells me that the Captain here is a veteran of the Great Cyber War.\nJAMIE: What’s he doing hanging about with a Cyberman, then?\nLANKY: I told you, I’m not — Oh, what’s the use?\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 44\nFRANK: Lanky, lad — don’t be like that. Lanky! (TO THE OTHERS) Now see what you’ve done, you’ve hurt his feelings!\nJAMIE: His what...?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 45\nJAMIE: SCENE 19: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nZOE: They’ve been gone a long time, your friends.\nZENNOX: Hardly.\nFINDEL: (INSPIRED) Sequence. Series...!\nZENNOX: I beg your pardon, Findel?\nFINDEL: Don’t you see? Any progressive series can be converted into binary notation. — That’s what you meant, isn’t it, Zoe?\nZOE: Well, obviously.\nZENNOX: So you know how to operate the control array?\nFINDEL: I think... yes!\nFINDEL: It’s a power series! The indices show the basic binary blocks!\nZOE: Wouldn’t it be better to work it all out on paper first?\nZOE: OF ARRAY LIGHTING UP.\nFINDEL: Who needs paper?!\nZENNOX: That’s the first gate gone!\nZOE: Yes, you seem to have opened something.\nFINDEL: Now for the next —\nBLASTED: BACK BY AN ELECTRIC SHOCK.\nBLASTED: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 46\nFINDEL: Aaah!\nZOE: Findel! (RUSHES TO HIM)\nZENNOX: The console’s electrified?\nZOE: Never mind that, there’s a man been electrocuted! (LISTENING) I can’t hear a heartbeat. I think he’s —\nZENNOX: Never mind that, you need to power down that console!\nZOE: Me?\nZENNOX: Well, I can’t do the equations! Do it, [or —]\nZOE: Lanky, thank goodness.\nZENNOX: Of course, he’s insulated...!\nZOE: Lanky, I need you to return all those levers to zero.\nZENNOX: Quickly!\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED) Intruders.\nZENNOX: What?\nZOE: (REALISATION) Oh no...!\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED) Intruders. Destroy...!\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 47\nZENNOX: I don’t understand...!\nZOE: I told you, Findel opened something!\nZENNOX: Then — that’s not Lanky...\nZOE: . it’s a real Cyberman!\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED) Destroy. Destroy. Destroy!!!\nCYBERMAN: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 48\nCYBERMAN: SCENE 20: INT. CORRIDOR\nFRANK: . anyway, your little chum agreed with Zennox, if we let one of you out, she’d open up these gate things, let us into the upper levels.\nDOCTOR: Logic gates?\nJAMIE: Like in the Cybermen’s tomb!\nFRANK: Ah, but there’s the thing: it’s not a tomb. (QUICKLY) So\nFRANK: Zennox says.\nJAMIE: Doctor, if Zoe’s helpin’ them...\nZOE: (AT TOP OF VOICE) Help! Somebody! Help!!!\nFRANK: What the blazes...?\nDOCTOR: The sound of Zoe helping, I’m afraid.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 49\nJAMIE: SCENE 21: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED) Intruders. Destroy. Intruders. Destroy.\nZENNOX: (CHOKED) It’s choking me...!\nZOE: (GRABBING CYBERMAN; EFFORT) Let go of her, you metal brute!\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED; POWER RUNNING DOWN) Destroy. Des... troy...\nZENNOX: (STILL GRIPPED, BUT CAN BREATHE NOW) It’s... slackening off!\nCYBERMAN: (ZOMBIFIED) Dess.. troyyyy...\nZOE: It’s running out of power! (BIG EFFORT) Let go of her!\nZOE: THE FLOOR. JAMIE RUNS IN, FOLLOWED BY DOCTOR AND FRANK.\nJAMIE: What the...?\nZOE: Jamie! — Better late than never, I suppose.\nJAMIE: (WALKING OVER) Were you just wrestlin’ that Cyberman?\nZOE: I was, rather.\nZENNOX: (RECOVERING) It ran out of power. Doubtless all it was running on was the surge Findel created.\nDOCTOR: It would appear to have been an automated sentry. A sort of zombie Cyberman.\nJAMIE: Ah, so it wasn’t that ‘Lanky’ fella.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 50\nZOE: Of course not, he’s nice.\nFRANK: Still, young Zoe — you had a pop at a real Cyberman. (TERRY- THOMAS) Good show...!\nDOCTOR: Findel.. (CROSSES TO FINDEL) That would be this poor unfortunate here, I — [presume? ]\nFINDEL: (BIG INTAKE OF BREATH, SUDDENLY REVIVED) Ah!\nZOE: He’s alive! — Doctor, how did you do that?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t touch him.\nFINDEL: (GASPING) There must... must have been a discontinuity...\nFRANK: Easy now, young fella. You’ve had a nasty shock.\nFINDEL: I’m fine. — Zoe, there must have been a discontinuity in the series!\nZOE: Yes, a Fourier series uniformly converges to the infinite sum except at discontinuities.\nFINDEL: (‘OF COURSE!’) A Fourier series!\nJAMIE: (TO DOCTOR) What the devil are you those two on about?\nDOCTOR: Mathematics, of course.\nZENNOX: I suppose you’re a mathematician, too?\nDOCTOR: Just a doctor who dabbles. — Curatrix Zennox, I presume? I don’t like your being here, Curatrix.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 51\nZENNOX: Likewise, “Doctor”.\nLANKY: (COMING IN) Thought you’d like to know: some kind of opening’s appeared in the transverse corr— [-idor] (FX: STOPS) (TAKING\nLANKY: IN SCENE) What the heck’s been happening here?\nFRANK: Rather a lot.\nDOCTOR: (TO LANKY) An opening, you say?\nZOE: That must have been where the sentry came from!\nJAMIE: Aye, So more Cybermen might come out of it!\nDOCTOR: I doubt that. Nonetheless, I’d like to take a look.\nJAMIE: Me too.\nZENNOX: Captain, go with them.\nFRANK: By all means.\nDOCTOR: The only thing is, can I trust everyone here to have the common sense to touch nothing until I return...?\nZOE: (POINTEDLY, MEANING ZENNOX) They’d be an idiot if they did.\nLANKY: I shall go too.\nZENNOX: You’1l stay here. (BEAT) For our protection?\nFRANK: It’s alright, Lanks.\nFRANK: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR: Very well. Jamie, Captain — this way.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22: INT. TRANSVERSE CORRIDOR/LIFT\nDOCTOR: Transverse corridor... ha, this must be it!\nFRANK: (STRUGGLING A BIT) Wait for us, you chaps. — Dodgy hip. Dodgy all of me, in fact...\nJAMIE: Aye, but Cybermen don’t wait for stragglers!\nFRANK: M.O. said I should have it replaced. I said, I’ve seen what that leads to, old chum. No fear. No bally fear!\nDOCTOR: An opening, yes! (DUCKS INSIDE)\nFRANK: Yes, that’s new, that must be the fella. You’d never have known it was there before.\nJAMIE: What’s behind it, Doctor, d’you suppose?\nDOCTOR: I do believe... a lift!\nFRANK: A what?\nDOCTOR: Come and see. (AS THE OTHER TWO PILE IN:) Cybermen don’t care for stairs.\nFRANK: Well, me neither.\nDOCTOR: Because they’re inefficient. — And for the same reason: no buttons.\nJAMIE: So how do we make it work?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: If the first logic gate opened the opening, logically the second gate lifts the lift.\nFRANK: Hold on, I’1l1 talk to Zennox.\nJAMIE: How?\nFRANK: I’m wearing a wire whatsit in my ear. (TOUCHING EAR) Frank calling Zennox. Can you hear me, Zennox?\nJAMIE: Doctor, are you sure that workin’ this lift is a good idea...?\nDOCTOR: No, but I think it’s what the old me would have done.\nJAMIE: Eh?\nFRANK: Says she’s been listening in all along, the dirty\nFRANK: eavesdropper!\nCUT TO: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 55\nCUT TO: SCENE 23: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nZENNOX: Lanky — return those levers to zero.\nZOE: I don’t think you should touch anything. The Doctor said —\nZENNOX: (LYING) That’s what the Captain says the Doctor wants.\nZOE: Oh!\nFINDEL: It makes sense — close one gate before you open the next.\nZENNOX: Do it, Lanky. You’re insulated, aren’t you?\nLANKY: Oh, yes.\nZENNOX: Now then, you two. The next equation, please.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 56\nZENNOX: SCENE 24: INT. LIFT\nZENNOX: THE LIFT.\nJAMIE: Hey, that’s yon opening closed!\nDOCTOR: Makes sense — close one gate before you open the next.\nFRANK: Yes, that’s what Findel said.\nJAMIE: Aye, but that means there’s no going back!\nCUT TO: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 57\nCUT TO: SCENE 25: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nCUT TO: RESETS, INDICATING ANOTHER SERIES OF EQUATIONS.\nZOE: There, look — that must be the next equation!\nZENNOX: Another progressive series.\nFINDEL: But this one must require a calculation to — what, ninety-two decimal places?\nZOE: Ninety-four, I think. — Race you?\nFINDEL: What?\nZOE: I’ll race you. Then we can double-check each other’s calculations for discontinuities.\nFINDEL: I realise that, but —\nZOE: I took the speed calculus cup from Gd6del House on my own.\nFINDEL: What?\nZOE: At the Parapsychology Unit. At school.\nFINDEL: But — I was in Gddel House!\nZOE: You were at the Parapsychology Unit, too?\nFINDEL: Class of Eighty-Eight, yes, [but —]\nZENNOX: Please — spare me the schooldays reminiscences, and get on with your work!\nFINDEL: (TO ZOE) Ninety-four places?\nFINDEL: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 58\nZOE: Go!\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 59\nZOE: SCENE 26: INT. LIFT\nJAMIE: Och, what are we waitin’ for?\nDOCTOR: For Zoe to solve the next equation in the series, which I presume will activate the lift.\nJAMIE: Aye, but how long’s that gonna take?\nDOCTOR: From what I could see on the control array, she’1ll have to give each equation to ninety-two decimal places.\nFRANK: Ninety-two?!\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s all. I wonder what’s keeping her?\nFRANK: Waiting’s the thing I could never bear. Cooped up in the cockpit of a Star-Spitfire, waiting for the enemy to show...\nJAMIE: What, in your Cyber-War?\nFRANK: It’s the waiting that dulls the senses. I had good chums killed by too long waiting. A split-second slow against a Cyber-fighter and it’s goodnight Piccadilly.\nJAMIE: We’re moving!\nCUT TO: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 60\nCUT TO: SCENE 27: INT.

It’s an alpha meson phosphor system.\nJAMIE: Aye, but it’s no’ working!\nDOCTOR: Agh! — I meant to find something to jam that with!\nJAMIE: I thought you didn’t have your sonic screwdriver?\nFRANK: Next time, I'll give the workings a blast from me old Astropistol.\nJAMIE: What, you’re armed?\nFRANK: Ah. Ms Zennox wasn’t supposed to know. (INTO WIRE) Sorry about that. Couldn’t bear to leave Earth space without it.\nDOCTOR: What’s Zennox saying?\nJAMIE: Doubt it’s ladylike.\nFRANK: She’s telling us to advance to the next gate.\nFRANK: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 62\nJAMIE: But we can’t see further’n the ends of our noses! — (REALISATION: THERE’S LIGHT AHEAD) Oh, hang about.\nDOCTOR: Yes, a light source. Hard to gauge the distance.\nJAMIE: Aye, and there’s another!\nFRANK: Thought occurs. Not a very jolly one.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it occurs to me also.\nJAMIE: What does?\nFRANK: Well, the old alpha meson phosphor lights weren’t necessarily designed to come on in the presence of humans, were they?\nJAMIE: You mean —\nCYBERMAN: #1: (ZOMBIFIED; OFF RIGHT) Destroy!\nCYBERMAN: #2: (ZOMBIFIED; OFF LEFT) Destroy!\nDOCTOR: Zombie sentinels, like before.\nJAMIE: Perhaps they’1ll just run down.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nFRANK: Don’t feel like taking the chance, do you? Down on the floor, chaps!\nJAMIE: You can’t shoot at somethin’ you can’t see!\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 63\nFRANK: Not aiming to.

Funny, that was supposed to be your problem.\nZOE: I beg your pardon?\nFINDEL: That’s what they said about us in the Unit, when they closed it down.\nZOE: I know, I used to get it from my friend Leo R— (REALISATION) Wait, they closed the Parapsychology Unit down?\nFINDEL: What, you didn’t know?\nZENNOX: Get on with opening the next gate. (INTO EAR) You’ve got five minutes to recover. Enough heart for you, Captain?\nZOE: (HUSHED) Findel. Why did they close the Unit down?\nFINDEL: (HUSHED) It was in the War. Some of the pupils — some of them formed... well, a secret society, you might call it.\nZOE: (HUSHED) I can’t think the tutors would have approved of that.\nFINDEL: (HUSHED) Oh no, some of them were in on it. The Brotherhood of Logicians, that’s what they called themselves. They believed that the War was pointless, because it would be better if we were to become more like Cybermen ourselves.\nZOE: (HUSHED) Madness!\nFINDEL: (HUSHED) In a way, it made sense. The Cybermen would never leave humanity alone, not while they could use us as spare parts. But if we viewed them in the same way — as something to be cannibalised for our own purposes — well, just imagine what we could become...!\nFINDEL: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 66\nZOE: (HUSHED) It doesn’t bear thinking about.\nFINDEL: (HUSHED) Well, when the authorities got wind of what was going on at the Unit, they shut it down. They forced us, all of us, to take intelligence suppressants. Drugs to make us stupid!\nZOE: (HUSHED) That’s inhuman!\nFINDEL: (HUSHED) That’s why I was surprised when you said you were at the Unit. For most of us, it’s not a badge of honour, but a secret shame.\nFINDEL: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 67\nFINDEL: SCENE 30: INT. LIFT\nDOCTOR: (MORE TO SELF) Hurry it up, Zoe. It’s only a few little sums.\nJAMIE: Aye, well, I’m in no rush to run into more o’ them Cybermen — zombies or otherwise.\nFRANK: Doctor — you seem to be a chap with his head screwed on when it comes to the Cybermen...\nDOCTOR: Bitter experience, alas. Go on.\nFRANK: Well, what do you suppose is at the top of the Citadel?\nJAMIE: Aye, just what are we risking our necks for?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nFRANK: Ms Zennox only has her eyes on the curatorial prize. An untouched hoard of Cyber-tech, she thinks. But in the wrong hands, well...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think it wise to keep a cautious eye on our Curatrix.\nJAMIE: My Doctor, he’d have had her marked out as a bad ‘un from the start.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERED) I wonder... is that why I came here?\nJAMIE: Eh?\nFRANK: Oh, Zennox isn’t a rotten sort, I don’t suppose. But it seems to me that your average civilian’s a bit eager to presume that the Cybermen are a thing of the past. Somethin’ that belongs only in museums and shows and gung-ho holo-movies.\nJAMIE: Aye, he is. My Doctor and I, there’s things we’ve seen — in the future, like —\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) What makes you think the Cybermen are still a danger, Captain? Any reason in particular?\nFRANK: (HESISTATNLY) I... remember one thing — at the time of the final assault, I saw the old space sonar overload. Not just hundreds — thousands of traces, [like there was a]\nFRANK: BEFORE.\nJAMIE: Hey, we’re off again!\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 69\nJAMIE: SCENE 31: INT.

Ms Heriot! — Perhaps you could bear to tear your eyes from one another and solve the next equation?!\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 70\nZENNOX: SCENE 32: INT. LIFT/MAINTENANCE SECTION\nJAMIE: Dark again.\nDOCTOR: Careful-!\nFRANK: Narrow old walkway, what?\nJAMIE: Aye. One hell of a drop either side, it looks like.\nDOCTOR: A handrail would be useful, I admit. Alas, Cybermen aren’t known for their adherence to Health and Safety.\nJAMIE: Least the other side’s visible. C’mon —\nDOCTOR: Not so fast, Jamie.\nJAMIE: Why, what’s the problem?\nFRANK: Maintenance infrastructure — wouldn’t you say, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I would, Captain.\nJAMIE: So?\nDOCTOR: So — what do we know carries out maintenance in this Citadel?\nDOCTOR: STOPS. BLEEPS.\nJAMIE: Och, a Cybermat! — Aye, well, we’ll just jump over the wee fella.\nUP OVER WALKWAY THROUGH: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: There’s more than just the one Cybermat in the way, Jamie.\nFRANK: Hundreds of the perishers, heading right for us!\nCUT TO: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 72\nCUT TO: SCENE 33: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM\nZENNOX: It seems our friends have a Cybermat problem.\nZOE: They’re only programmed for maintenance. If they don’t antagonise them, well — well, perhaps they’1ll just ignore them...?\nLANKY: That, lass, is the problem. Programmed for maintenance.\nZOE: So...?\nFINDEL: So, they think anything humanoid’s a Cyberman. When they perceive a Cyberman not giving off the correct communications aura... they'll try to repair it.\nZOE: Repair it? How?\nLANKY: From the inside.\nFINDEL: Through the mouth. Through the eyes.\nZENNOX: And if all else fails, by trying to open up the chest unit.\nZOE: Oh no...!\nZENNOX: Hurry it up with the next equation. (INTO EAR) Captain — proceed. If you can.\nCUT TO: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 73\nCUT TO: SCENE 34: INT. MAINTENANCE SECTION\nJAMIE: Well, what do we do now? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No way back, no way left, no way right...\nFRANK: Up. Look up!\nJAMIE: Cables, aye. Stretchin’ all the way across the ceilin’! — Doctor, are you thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?\nDOCTOR: I’m thinking it’s time we rediscovered our simian ancestry.\nJAMIE: No, I was thinkin’ we could swing along those cables — like monkeys, see?\nDOCTOR: I’ll give you a leg-up.\nJAMIE: (EFFORT AS HE TAKES LEG-UP AND GRABS HOLD OF CABLE ALONG CEILING) Got it?\nFRANK: Will it hold?\nDOCTOR: It had better. Captain — you next.\nFRANK: No, sir — you next.\nJAMIE: Hurry, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Alright. (EFFORT AS HE TAKES LEG-UP FROM FRANK, GRABS CABLE) Got it. Now, Captain — take my hand.\nFRANK: Can’t do that, old chum.\nJAMIE: Move it! There’s millions of ‘em!\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 74\nFRANK: Fact is, it wasn’t just the hip the quacks wanted to replace. Took a shoulderful of space shrapnel in the final battle. That’s shot to blazes too. I’1ll never be able to hold on.\nDOCTOR: Captain, you have to try-!\nFRANK: Best thing all round is if I make a dash down the walkway. Distract the wee beggars. Stop ‘’em from swarming up after you. (REMOVING EARPIECE) Here, take my wire.\nDOCTOR: We can’t just leave you!\nDOCTOR: Captain, please!\nFRANK: No time for arguing. (REMEMBERING) ‘Let the sacrifice be made. ’\nDOCTOR: ‘Sacrifice’?!\nFRANK: You'll see. (CHARGES DOWN WALKWAY) Tally-bally-hoooo!!!\nFRANK: FADE.\nJAMIE: C’mon, Doctor!

LIFT IN MOTION.\nJAMIE: So what’s next?\nDOCTOR: If my reading of the control array was correct, Jamie, this is the last stage of our journey.\nJAMIE: You mean, the heart of the Cyber-citadel?\nDOCTOR: More like, the brain.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 37: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: (INTO EAR) Well, Doctor? Do you see it? Is it there?\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 77\nZENNOX: SCENE 38: INT. LIFT/PLANNER SECTION [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Yes, Ms Zennox. It’s here.\nJAMIE: What is it? It’s like — I dunno, a head in a spider’s web.\nDOCTOR: It’s a Cyber-Planner, Jamie. I take it you’ve not yet encountered the Cybermen on Earth? In the year 1975?\nJAMIE: What, in cahoots with that fella Vaughn? Oh aye, that was weeks back.\nDOCTOR: Oh! But don’t you remember —\nJAMIE: Don’t you remember, I took a bullet in the leg? Missed out on the best part of the action, worst luck.\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course. Well — this is a Cyber-Planner. An augmented cybernetic brain, used for the purposes of tactical co- ordination.\nJAMIE: A sort of Cyber-General?\nDOCTOR: Sort of. (INTO EAR) Yes, I can hear you, Zennox. I’m examining it now. — There seems to be... some damage to the brain pan.\nJAMIE: Looks a funny colour. Like an Arbroath Smokie. Smells a bit like it, an’ all.\nDOCTOR: (INTO EAR) I regret to say, Jamie’s simile is not inaccurate. My guess is, the damage was caused by lightning strike. You might have noticed, there’s some ferocious electronic activity in this planetoid’s atmosphere...? (A THOUGHT) Unless the Citadel itself is causing the phenomenon?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR: SCENE 39: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: (INTO EAR) But can you uninstall it, without damaging the connections? — Doctor?\nZOE: So that’s your game...!\nZENNOX: Be quiet!\nZENNOX: SCENE 40: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: (INTO EAR) So that’s your game, is it, Zennox?\nJAMIE: What is?\nDOCTOR: I imagine our Curatrix wants this as the centrepiece of her\nDOCTOR: collection. A complete Cyber-consciousness!\nJAMIE: Aye, but it’s fried, you said.\nDOCTOR: Doubtless it could be repaired — couldn’t it?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 41: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: (INTO EAR) But the Cybermats couldn’t repair it — could they?\nZOE: I don’t understand. — What’s going on? Findel?\nFINDEL: Oh, Zoe — I thought you had a logical brain?\nFINDEL: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 79\nFINDEL: SCENE 42: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: That’s why you summoned me here, isn’t it, Zennox? The other me?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 43: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: (SCOFFS) Summoned you?! — I summoned no-one. But you know the Cybermen well, of that I’ve no longer any doubt. The question is — can you do it? Can you uninstall the Planner, without damaging the connections?\nZOE: Don’t listen to her, Doctor! The Cyber-Planner is dangerous! It must be destroyed!\nZENNOX: Findel, cover her.\nFINDEL: No, Ms Zennox —\nZENNOX: Or shall I have you sent back to the internment unit? Back under the chemical cosh?\nZOE: Oh, Findel. Is that why —\nFINDEL: (PRODUCING GUN) I’m sorry.\nZOE: An Astropistol! — You’re not going to shoot me, Findel.\nLANKY: It’s not you he’s pointing it at, lass.\nLANKY: SCENE 44: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nJAMIE: What’s going on down there? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure —\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: SCENE 45: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nFINDEL: I’ve changed my mind, Curatrix. This is wrong. This is dangerous...!\nZENNOX: A pretty young girl comes along and suddenly that brain of yours turns to mush. You pathetic adolescent.\nZOE: Oh, Findel. You’re blushing.\nFINDEL: It’s not — it’s not just that...\nZENNOX: Bluffing, more like. (PRODUCES OWN GUN) Well, I call your bluff.\nZOE: Oh, no! — Doctor, she’s got an Astropistol of her own. Doctor!\nZOE: SCENE 46: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Zennox, stay calm! I’m sure we can reach an amicable arrangement, without the need for threats —\nDOCTOR: SCENE 47: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: I doubt that very much, Doctor. Not when you hear the next stage of the plan.\nZENNOX: SCENE 48: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Repair and reactivate the Cyber-Planner, I suppose? Zennox, I’m afraid that’s impossible —\nDOCTOR: SCENE 49: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: Well, of course it’s impossible. The thing’s fried. No, I want you to install a replacement consciousness inside the apparatus. A trained, logical mind.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 81\nFINDEL: I told you, Curatrix, I don’t want to do it!\nZENNOX: I no longer want you to do it.\nZOE: (WARNING) Findel, watch out!\nLANKY: Master Findel-!\nZENNOX: Stay away from him, both of you! (INTO EAR) Now, Doctor — now do you understand why I’ve let you get this far...?\nZENNOX: SCENE 50: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) I think I do.\nJAMIE: What’s she on about? Doctor?\nJAMIE: SCENE 51: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: I need an appropriate mind to install inside the apparatus. A brilliant, logical mind. A mind that’s already half-machine — to reactivate the base, reactivate the beacon?\nZOE: B-beacon?\nZENNOX: Isn’t it obvious, that’s what this Citadel is? A beacon, to summon the last of the Cybermen!\nLANKY: (MOVING FORWARD) Alright, we’1ll do what you want. But you mustn’t hurt Zoe, [or the D]\nZENNOX: Stay back, freak!\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 82\nZOE: Lanky!!!\nZENNOX: (TO LANKY) The Cybermen didn’t get round to removing your pain centres. I might not be able to kill you outright with just this, but I can make you suffer.\nLANKY: Just... don’t hurt them... (PASSES OUT)\nZENNOX: As I was saying, Doctor: an appropriate mind. A brilliant, young mind...\nZOE: You don’t mean...?\nZOE: SCENE 52: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nJAMIE: What’s she saying, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Zennox brought Findel here to use as a brain to power this... Beacon, apparently. But as it’s turned out, a rather better candidate has emerged.\nJAMIE: What?\nDOCTOR: Zoe. She wants Zoe.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 53: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: And I thank you for bringing her to me — Doctor!\nZOE: No!\nZOE: END OF EPISODE TWO\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 83\nZOE: EPISODE THREE\nDOCTOR: Zennox brought Findel here to use as a brain to power this... Beacon, apparently. But as it’s turned out, a rather better candidate has emerged.\nJAMIE: What?\nDOCTOR: Zoe. She wants Zoe.\nZENNOX: And I thank you for bringing her to me — Doctor!\nZOE: No!!!\nZOE: SCENE 54: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: zZennox, listen to me. —\nJAMIE: Gimme that ear-wig. I want to talk to her.\nDOCTOR: Patience, Jamie, p— (DOUBLE-TAKE) ‘Ear-wig’?\nJAMIE: Whatever it is, give it here! (INTO WIRE) Is that it? Can you hear us?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 84\nJAMIE: SCENE 55: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZENNOX: (SIGH) Oh, the throwback. (SLOW) Put the Doctor back on. — The Doctor, you understand?\nZOE: Let me talk to Jamie. — Please, Zennox. I’1l make sure they co-operate!\nZENNOX: I can’t make out the dialect from the profanities, anyhow.\nZOE: Jamie, it’s m- (SHOCKED) That’s a terrible word! — I should hope you didn’t realise, yes. — Listen, this is very\nZOE: important. Whatever it is Ms Zennox wants... I want you to stop her. Stop her, whatever the [cost—]\nZENNOX: No, no, no — (MAKES TO GRAB WIRE BACK)\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 85\nZENNOX: SCENE 56: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nJAMIE: They’re at it like cats, by the sounds of it.\nDOCTOR: Children!\nJAMIE: Aye, well, that Zennox started it.\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t referring to her.\nJAMIE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Give me the wire back. — The wire, Jamie!\nDOCTOR: (INTO EAR) Zoe, that’s enough. Give me Zennox. — Zennox, now!\nJAMIE: (STOMPING OFF) Right, that does it...\nDOCTOR: Jamie, what do you think you’re doing?\nJAMIE: (OFF) That Zennox wants to put Zoe’s brain inside this Planner thing, right?\nDOCTOR: That’s the gist of her scheme, yes.\nJAMIE: (OFF) Well, she won’t be able to do nothing if I smash it to pieces with my bare hands, will she? Let’s see now...\nDOCTOR: Jamie, she’ll kill Zoe if you do.\nJAMIE: (OFF) You don’t know that!\nDOCTOR: I don’t need to, it’s what any villain in their wrong mind would do. — Jamie, I’m warning you! I’m not the prancing pixie\nDOCTOR: I used to be, not any more.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 86\nJAMIE: Oh, aye? (RETURNING) C’mon, then. (GRABS DOCTOR) Let’s see what you’ve got!\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) Jamie, please! — We won’t solve anything by fighting amongst ourselves!\nJAMIE: No, but I might get some satisfaction in wipin’ the smirk off your patronisin’ chops..! (SOTTO) Besides, if Zennox thinks\nJAMIE: you’ve laid us out on the deck, I might be able to grab her from behind when she gets here, like?\nDOCTOR: Ah...! — I mean, (MOCK-PAINED) aaaargh!\nJAMIE: (LOUD) Come on, then. Give us your best shot, you great... soft... English babby!\nDOCTOR: Well, if that’s what you want...\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57: INT. CITADEL CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nZOE: Are they fighting again?\nZENNOX: (INTO EAR) Whichever one of you two has the wire, stop! Your friend Ms Heriot is back under my control. I would remind you, it’s only her mind I need. I can always arrange for the Cybermats to remove any number of surplus parts...!\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 88\nZENNOX: SCENE 58: INT. PLANNER ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: (INTO EAR) .. That won’t be necessary, Ms Zennox. I’ve quelled our little Jacobite Rebellion. — Well, don’t sound so surprised! — Venusian karate, as a matter of fact. Our hotheaded Highland chum will be out for hours. — Venusian karate. — No, I am not making it up! — Yes, there’s a matching\nDOCTOR: control array, I’m sure I can open everything up from here. Doctor out. — Dear me.\nJAMIE: Well — are they coming?\nJAMIE: BELOW, THROUGH:\nDOCTOR: Once I’ve opened up their route, yes. The entire citadel appears to be slaved to this master array.\nJAMIE: Lucky, that.\nDOCTOR: Not really, it’s perfectly logical. Doubtless that was why Ms Zennox sent you, me and the Captain up here first — to deal with any difficulties she might have encountered en route...\nJAMIE: Like canaries in a coalmine.\nDOCTOR: (FINISHING JOB) There. Done.\nJAMIE: We should work out a signal for when they get here. You say somethin’ to tip us the wink, I’1ll go for Zennox’s gun.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. Jamie, you said you last met the Cybermen in London, in 1975 — correct?\nJAMIE: Aye.\nDOCTOR: So what have you been up to since? You, Zoe and your Doctor?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 89\nJAMIE: I dunno. This and that. After that business in London, we followed the Cybermen to Isos II. Then we ran into the Ice Warriors on the moon. Then we went to Australia, then we were in the city o’ Tromesis. After that came Saturn; after that we met that fella Caven, an’ his Space Pirates...\nDOCTOR: (REMEMBERING) Ta!\nJAMIE: No bother. Now what about this signal?\nDOCTOR: I mean, you’ve been to Ta. — The Issigri base, on the planet Ta?\nJAMIE: Wednesday last, I think. Why?\nDOCTOR: Oh... no reason. — A signal, yes. How about when you hear me say\nJAMIE: Aw no. You’re doin’ that face.\nDOCTOR: What face?\nJAMIE: The same face my Doctor does, when he’s hidin’ somethin’ he thinks I’m too stupid to understand. — Hey, are you gonna call\nJAMIE: for help from the Space Corps?\nDOCTOR: Space Corps?\nJAMIE: You know, that General fella. Hermack, that’s his name.\nDOCTOR: No, no. I was just trying to establish where we are, exactly, in my personal chronology.\nJAMIE: What about ‘Madeleine’ ?\nDOCTOR: Madeleine?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 90\nJAMIE: You know, that Dom Issigri’s daughter. Right cracker, she was.\nDOCTOR: I don’t recall. What about her?\nJAMIE: For a Signal. You say ‘Madeleine’, I jump Zennox.\nDOCTOR: You expect me to just drop the name ‘Madeleine’ into casual conversation?\nJAMIE: Nooo. But we don’t want to pick some word you might say by accident, like.\nDOCTOR: Alright, ‘Madeleine’ it is. (WRY) Proust again.\nJAMIE: Huh?\nDOCTOR: A la recherche du temps perdu. Very apt, given the circumstances.\nJAMIE: I tell you what — I don’t ask what the devil you’re on about now, you don’t give me that face. Deal?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 91\nJAMIE: SCENE 59: INT. LIFT/PLANNER SECTION [MINUTES LATER]\nZOE: You do realise, Zennox, that your Astropistol’s charge needs to radiate outwards for maximum effect?\nZENNOX: So?\nZOE: So, if you fire while it’s pressed up against my spine like that, it’1ll only diminish the blast.\nZENNOX: Not interested.\nZOE: But if you let go a little, you’d look more confident, and I'd be more comfortable.\nDOCTOR: You made it.\nZOE: Doctor! — I do hope you didn’t hurt Jamie, with your karate?\nDOCTOR: Gracious, no. I caught him in a Cytherean clasp. Less of a bear-hug, more of a cuddle.\nZENNOX: Move forward to the Planner, Ms Heriot. Doctor — I trust the cerebral nodes are clean? — Then please, remove the head.\nDOCTOR: As you wish.\nZENNOX: From what I understand of the technology, electrical energy from Ms Heriot’s own brain will regenerate the dendritic connections.\nZOE: Surely that’s not possible!\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: It’s Cyber-technology, Zoe, it’s perfectly p.. (TRAILS OFF —\nDISTRACTED: BY FRANK’S VOICE IN HIS HEAD! SEE NEXT SCENE)\nZOE: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (TO UNSEEN FRANK) Perfectly. (TO ZOE) Er, possible. Perfectly possible!\nZENNOX: Kindly concentrate, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (WORKING) I am concentrating!\nZOE: You called this a beacon, Zennox — to summon the last of the Cybermen. Forgive me for asking, but... why?\nDOCTOR: (WORKING) It’s an old story. Zennox knows best, but nobody listens. With a bunch of silver bully-boys on her side, they’1l have to. No, the rather more interesting question is this: what’s the point?\nZENNOX: Get on with it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Head detached, job done. — I freely admit, Ms Zennox, that at the height of their powers the Cybermen were a formidable force indeed — but now? All that’s left are a few scattered survivors, little more than space scavengers.\nZENNOX: Is that what you believe?\nDOCTOR: I know, I’ve met them! Trust me, they’1ll be easy meat for Earth’s defences. Bringing them together, here, will all-but- guarantee their total extinction. I mean, if that’s what you want...\nZENNOX: I’m not talking about a few survivors. I’m talking about a fleet of ten thousand Cyberships, inside the Kuiper boundary.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: Inside the..? Now I know you’re not serious. I could just about believe in some great lost fleet in the Orion Nebula, or the Vega System; the Madillon Cluster, perhaps...\nZENNOX: Rubbish, that’s Rutan [space. ]\nJAMIE: (LEAPING UP) Craig an tu-[ire!!!]\nZOE: (WARNING) Jamie, look [out!]\nJAMIE: (DIVING) Woah!!!\nDOCTOR: Well done, Zennox, you’ve blown a whacking great hole in the wall. How useful. [NB: HE KNOWS THAT FRANK IS LISTENING... ]\nZENNOX: Move one millimetre, either of you, and I’1l blast the boy’s head clean through it!\nJAMIE: I’m not movin’! Not movin’!\nZOE: (GOING OVER TO JAMIE) Jamie! How long were you shamming?\nZENNOX: (DISDAINFUL) Oh, it was a trap. — Stand away from him, Ms Heriot!\nJAMIE: I was waitin’ for the Doctor to give me the signal, when your woman’s back was turned. But for some stupid reason he gave it when she was lookin’ right at us..!\nDOCTOR: I did not!\nJAMIE: Aye, you did! Somethin’ about a Madeleine Cluster?\nZOE: That’s the Mad-ill-on Cluster, Jamie. It’s a space place.\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 94\nJAMIE: Aye, well, it’s a stupid name for a space place.\nDOCTOR: I only used it as an example.\nZENNOX: The last of the Cybermen are not in the Orion Nebula, nor the Vega System, and certainly not the Madillon Cluster. They’re here.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, ‘here’?\nZENNOX: Right here, above our heads.\nDOCTOR: (CROSSING ROOM) Well, let’s take a look out of the hole you made, shall we? Because... (CALLING OUTSIDE — SECRETLY\nSIGNALLING: FRANK) “I see no ships..!” (BACK IN) And certainly not a ten thousand-strong fleet.\nZENNOX: You might not see them, but they’re there.\nJAMIE: That fella, the Captain. He said somethin’ about his doo-dah overloadin’, back in the War...\nDOCTOR: His space sonar, yes.\nZENNOX: I heard more than enough of that man’s war stories on the way here, thank you. — Ms Heriot, you said you were prepared to\nZENNOX: co-operate?\nZOE: Provided you let the Doctor and Jamie go, yes.\nZENNOX: Well, then — install yourself in the mechanism.\nDOCTOR: Zoe, you don’t have to do this...\nZOE: (SETTLING INTO PLANNER UNIT) Like this?\nZENNOX: Rest your forehead against the connection disc.\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 95\nZOE: It won’t hurt, will it?\nZENNOX: Like the Doctor said, it’s Cyber-technology. You won’t feel a thing.\nJAMIE: No, but she won’t feel anything, not ever again!\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Jamie.\nZOE: (GASPS) It tingles...!\nJAMIE: Zoe!\nZENNOX: Well? Has it taken?\nZOE: It’s like I’ve got x-ray vision. This whole world, I can see right through it...!\nZENNOX: Yes, your consciousness is being routed through the Citadel sensors. Look up — up into the night sky.\nZENNOX: NB: ZOE’S VOICE BECOMES FLATTER — “ZOE [POSSESSED BY PLANNER]” INDICATES THE CYBER-PLANNER SPEAKING THROUGH ZOE’S VOICE; NOT AN ELECTRONIC EFFECT, ALTHOUGH...\nZENNOX: PLANNER]” SPEECHES, TO INDICATE THAT IT’S DOING THE THINKING.\nZOE: [POSSESSED BY PLANNER] : Scanning now.\nJAMIE: But... that’s not Zoe speaking!\nDOCTOR: No, the Cyber-Planner is using her as a mouthpiece.\nZENNOX: (TO ZOE) Well? Do you see them?\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 96\nZOE: [POSSESSED BY PLANNER] : In their thousands. Waiting. Yes.\nJAMIE: What’s it on about?!\nDOCTOR: Never mind now, Jamie. Come round here, to me.\nJAMIE: What, by the hole in the wall?!\nZENNOX: I see you, Doctor. Don’t think that I don’t.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Zennox.

No. But it’d be more heroic than being shot.\nJAMIE: You’re not serious...!\nDOCTOR: Ready, Jamie? After three.\nZENNOX: No, you’re up to something...!\nDOCTOR: Threetwoone.

A GIANT ARC-LIGHT ACTIVATES, SHIMMERING THROUGH:\nJAMIE: What, like all that pinky light comin’ out of it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. Zoe’s realigned the beacon!\nJAMIE: What beacon?\nDOCTOR: The lamp, at the top of the head of the Citadel. I knew it had to be more than decoration...!\nFRANK: (COMING OVER) That’s what made Zennox realise. She saw its purpose, right away. She wants to send them a signal!\nJAMIE: Send who a signal?\nFRANK: The last of the Cybermen, of course!\nJAMIE: Oh aye, this phantom fleet o’ yours.\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 102\nFRANK: Ten thousand ships, just disappeared off my trace right at the time of the final assault. I told them, after the battle — the brass hats. I warned ‘’em, it wasn’t over! Oh, but they wouldn’t listen. Just gave me a shirtful of medals and a pat on the head, put it down to shellshock and packed me off to counselling. Counselling, bah!\nJAMIE: Aye, but I see no ships either!\nDOCTOR: Ask yourself, Jamie — where do you think those ten thousand traces disappeared to...?\nJAMIE: C’mon, I’m not Zoe.\nFRANK: Into warpspace, that’s what I think!\nDOCTOR: Warpspace, exactly. A sort of secret passage through normal space, leading here. That was why the Cybermen positioned the Citadel in the Kuiper belt — so they could launch a final, devastating counter-attack, right at the edge of Earth’s galaxy.\nJAMIE: (PUTTING IT TOGETHER) Then... the reason they haven’t til now is because... because their Planner was busted!\nFRANK: Spot on!\nDOCTOR: The beacon marked the fleet’s exit point.

It’s about rescuin’ Zoe!\nDOCTOR: I know, old friend. I know. Only this time, it won’t be us doing the rescuing. (FX: CROSSES BACK TO CHEST ON FLOOR) No, this time we need to call for help.\nJAMIE: Help? Who’s gonna help us all the way out — (REALISATION) Ohh, I know what you’re plannin’!\nDOCTOR: You do?\nJAMIE: You’re going to call in the Space Corps! — Aye, good old General Hermack! He’1ll kick those Cybermen’s tin backsides all the way to [Telos!]\nDOCTOR: No, no. Wrong time zone.\nJAMIE: Then who? — And what’re you doin’, messin’ about in that old chest o’ yours again? Old socks an’ bagpipes won’t help us any against the Cybermen!\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING) I’m looking for a small cube, about so big. It might be disassembled, in six equal pieces...\nJAMIE: (STOOPING TO PICK UP PIECES) What, like these?\nDOCTOR: Well spotted, Jamie! Now: if you could just lay the pieces out on the floor, in a circle...?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 105\nJAMIE: (AS HE SETS PIECES DOWN:) Don’t see how all this helps Zoe. If it was up to me, I’d use that dagger of Saladin’s to sort out\nJAMIE: that Zennox, good and proper. — There! Is that how you mean?\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie. Now — (SITS IN LOTUS POSITION)\nJAMIE: Why’re you sittin’ like one of those Tibetan monks?\nDOCTOR: It helps me concentrate. Now - (DEEP BREATH)\nJAMIE: You want me to give it a bit of the old ‘om mani padme hum’?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPS) No, I do not!

You made a cube!\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: (PICKING UP CUBE) Yes, it is rather impressive, isn’t it?\nJAMIE: Aye, well, it’s only a cube.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s a four-dimensional hypercube. A sort of psychic container, for sending messages into the ether.\nJAMIE: What, so we need to find a space pigeon now?\nDOCTOR: The cube is the pigeon. The message is the thought I’ve put inside it. A telepathic telegram, if you like.\nJAMIE: Right. And who are you sendin’ this telepathic telegram to, exactly?\nDOCTOR: (HEAVILY) I’m so sorry, Jamie. I’m sending it to the Time Lords.\nJAMIE: The Time Lords, eh?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nJAMIE: Well, who in the name of Auld Clootie’s these Time Lords?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 107\nJAMIE: SCENE 68: INT.

That is logical!\nZENNOX: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 108\nZENNOX: SCENE 69: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: The Time Lords? Well, they can put an end to this whole ghastly business.\nJAMIE: Aye, but who are they?\nDOCTOR: They’re my own people, Jamie.\nJAMIE: Oh, well, that’s all right, then.\nDOCTOR: It’s very far from all right. But I’m afraid that there’s no alternative.\nJAMIE: What’s the problem here? Is it something to do with you bein’ — whatever it is, translocated?\nDOCTOR: In part. This is a critical moment in my own personal chronology. Very soon, perhaps the next time the TARDIS lands, your Doctor will be forced to call on the Time Lords for help in returning whole armies of soldiers snatched out of space and time.\nJAMIE: So?\nDOCTOR: He’s been running away from them all these years. Once they catch him — well, there’s trouble.\nJAMIE: Why? What had you done?\nDOCTOR: What hadn’t I done? Stolen the TARDIS. Interfered in the affairs of other planets...\nJAMIE: You stole the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: I was bored!\nJAMIE: Don’t tell me that’s your defence!\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: No! — Well, only in part...\nJAMIE: So they’re gonna throw the book at you.\nDOCTOR: Not just the book. The whole library. They’1l change my face. Exile me to Earth...\nJAMIE: What, so that’s it? Och, well, nae bother. All this dashin’ about on other planets, sometimes it gets right on me—\nDOCTOR: (SHARPLY) You won’t be joining me, Jamie. Nor Zoe, for that matter.\nJAMIE: Well, why n— Och, no, don’t tell me somethin’s gonna happen?\nDOCTOR: Jamie, I’m so sorry.\nJAMIE: I always thought — always thought when the time came to jack in all this messin’ about in space, you’d see us back in the Highlands. Aye, with a fair wee lassie by my side, with good strong hips for breedin’. Still, if the Piper’s gonna come a- callin’ — well then, so be [it.]\nDOCTOR: The Piper? Jamie, you’re not going to die!\nJAMIE: That’s all right then. — What about Zoe?\nDOCTOR: Zoe will be fine. The Time Lords will send both of you back: Zoe to the Wheel, and you —\nJAMIE: What, to Scotland?!\nDOCTOR: ‘Aye’.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 110\nJAMIE: With a fair wee lassie, with good [strong]\nDOCTOR: Any lasses are your own business, I’m afraid.\nJAMIE: Still, all’s well that ends well, eh?\nDOCTOR: They’1l take your memories away, Jamie. It’1ll be like you and I never met.\nJAMIE: Well, what do they want to do that for?!\nDOCTOR: If I knew the answer to that, I’d never have run away from home in the first place.\nJAMIE: Tell you what. Why don’t we call these Time Lords like you say — then pinch Zoe back from the Cybermen, an’ hie awa’ in the\nTARDIS: before they catch us?\nDOCTOR: Because it’s my fault, Jamie. All of this. Your Doctor — for once, he had the sense not to get involved. I think he’d scouted out the situation, seen there was no way that Zennox would break through to the Cyber-Planner without assistance — and he left well alone.\nJAMIE: Aye, mebbe...\nDOCTOR: If he and I had not been translocated, you’d have all been gone hours ago. But no, thanks to my involvement, the Great Cyber War is about to restart, and Earth — well, it’s not inconceivable that Earth will be annihilated.\nJAMIE: Well, when you put it like that...\nDOCTOR: Ironic, isn’t it? This time I’m going to turn myself in for the crime of interference in the affairs of other planets. Only this time, I can’t defend my actions. (THINKS) Perhaps that’s the point...?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 111\nFRANK: Heads up, you chaps!\nJAMIE: Somethin’ up out there, Captain?\nFRANK: I’ll say. Come on, you need to take a look at this...!\nFRANK: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 112\nFRANK: SCENE 70: EXT. PLANETOID [CONTINUOUS]\nFRANK: SWOOSH! — AND ANOTHER.\nDOCTOR: What is it..? (SEES) Ah.\nFRANK: Cyber-ships, coming out of the warp.\nJAMIE: What, that crack in the clouds?\nFRANK: That one’s coming in to land. It’s all kicking off!\nDOCTOR: An advance party. I imagine their task is to secure the Citadel. Efficient as they are, not even the Cybermen can mobilise a ten-thousand-strong fleet in an instant.\nJAMIE: Seems to me that Beacon is the source of all our troubles. Captain — if we took that flyer of yours up, tried to knock out that lamp whatsit...\nDOCTOR: It won’t work. His ordnance is too light.\nJAMIE: Doesn’t matter. Fly that thing right at that beacon and boom!\nFRANK: The old kamikaze manouevre, eh? Can’t say it appeals terribly, old chap.\nJAMIE: Then I’11 do it! How hard can it be pilotin’ that thing?\nDOCTOR: A noble gesture, Jamie — but that’s accelerated light. The flyer will melt the second she crosses the beam. She’s not indestructible.\nJAMIE: (PRODDING) Not like the TARDIS, eh...?\nDOCTOR: No. (REALISATION) No...!\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 113\nJAMIE: You see, my Doctor, he could fly the TARDIS about like a helicopter when he wanted.\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) If I put her into hover mode, and disable the HADS — that’s the Hostile Action Displacement Systenm...\nFRANK: Now, I can’t say this sounds wise...\nJAMIE: Faintheart! C’mon, Doctor, let’s do it!\nDOCTOR: I’ll do it, Jamie. The TARDIS’s mass might be enough to knock out the beacon, but I can’t know what damage she’1ll sustain in the process. I need one of us to be in a fit state to rescue Zoe — you understand?\nJAMIE: Not really, no.\nDOCTOR: Twas ever thus. — Goodbye, old friend.

This is the thirteenth corridor you've marched us down, and I’ve only got little legs.\nCYBERMAN: You have been summoned by the Super-Controller.\nDOCTOR: And what, pray, does this ‘Super-Controller’ want with us?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 130\nZOE: (LOOKING THROUGH OPEN DOOR) I think you’d better ask it that...!\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: (OFF, BEYOND DOOR) Bring the prisoners...!\nCYBERMAN: Proceed!\nCYBERMAN: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 131\nCYBERMAN: SCENE 90: INT. SUPER-CONTROLLER’S CHAMBER [CONTINUOUS]\nCYBERMAN: VAST, BLOATED SUPER-CONTROLLER; THINK ‘JABBA THE CYBERMAN’.\nCYBERMAN: SUPER-CONTROLLER: The Doctor. Our enemy. Come forward.\nZOE: Doctor, it’s huge!\nDOCTOR: ‘Bloated’ is the word that springs to mind.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Sensors throughout my corpus link my intelligence to every part of the Cyber-Empire.\nDOCTOR: And there was me thinking you were just big-boned.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER:\nZOE: Doctor, don’t provoke it.\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t me that caused that reaction. If I didn’t know better, I’d say that was...\nZOE: Pain. It’s in pain!\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: (RALLYING) Pain... is a human concept. I feel... no pain.\nDOCTOR: You’re connected to every part of the Cyber-Empire. Every bomb exploding on the surface. Every Cybership being shot down in the skies above. Every Cyberman falling to a Glittergun. That’s what you’re experiencing.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER:\nDOCTOR: At the current rate of attrition, Cyber-operations on Telos will become untenable in two point five-five cycles. Then, I will cease to function.\nDOCTOR: Death comes to us all in the end.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: The warp will deliver my Cyber-Fleet to Earth’s galaxy. Telos will fall. But Earth will fall also.\nZOE: At least you won’t be around to see it.\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: I must survive. I will survive.\nDOCTOR: How? There’s not a ship this side of Tython that could accommodate your bulk.\nZOE: What, not even the TARDIS?\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: The Doctor’s time ship has been transported to Telos. Cyber- engineers confirm that it is critically damaged.\nZOE: Doctor, is that true?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. — I’ve no lifeboat to offer you, Super- Controller.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Strategy A will not succeed. But there is another vessel in which I can escape.\nDOCTOR: Like what? The Titanic?\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Zoe Heriot.\nZOE: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nZOE: Well? Is there something you want to ask me, Super-Controller?\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Zoe Heriot. You are the vessel in which I shall escape.\nZOE: What?!\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: It won’t work. Her human brain is too small to accommodate your mighty consciousness.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Her brain is highly compartmentalised. She is half a machine already. That is how she could channel a Cyber-Planner.\nZOE: I won’t do it. I’1l.. I’1l hypnotise myself! Doctor, pass me your fobwatch —\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Cyberman, restrain Zoe Heriot.\nCYBERMAN: #1: Confirm.\nZOE: (GRABBED) Aow!\nDOCTOR: Look here, Super-Controller. If it’s a big brain you want, take mine. A human brain, that’s a Mini Cooper. My brain, that’s a Rolls Royce!\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Doctor. Strategy A will not succeed. Your TARDIS is inoperable.\nDOCTOR: So...?\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: You are no longer needed. Cyberman — take him to the conversion unit.\nCYBERMAN: #2: Confirm.\nDOCTOR: (GRABBED) Turn me into a Cyberman? What’s the point? Telos is going to fall!\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: Ground troops are no longer required.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Then you might as well kill me here and now. Anything else is a failure of logic!\nZOE: Doctor, what do you [think you’ re—]\nDOCTOR: Ssh, Zoe. — You Cybermen, listen to me. Your Super- Controller’s gone gaga. If I were you, [I’d]\nCYBERMAN: #2: Silence.\nCYBERMAN: SUPER-CONTROLLER:\nCYBERMAN: Doctor. The conversion unit is connected to my consciousness also. When the surgical saws cut into your body, I will be aware. When the adjustment probes burrow into your brain, I will be aware.\nDOCTOR: You want to... ‘feel my pain’?\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER: I will be... aware. — Take him.\nZOE: No!

Right now, every last Cyberman matters!\nPRISONER: #2: (OFF) Please, I don’t want to be a Cyberman...!\nCYBERMAN: Proceed.

Won’t be long now. You wait here with old Lanky.\nDOCTOR: Lanky!\nYOUNGER LANKY: It’s on account of the accent. Me real name’s ‘John’. John Fitzwilliam. Sounds posh, don’t it? But I’m common as anything, me.\nYOUNGER LANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR: John Fitzwilliam, I believe you to be a very rare specimen indeed. I’m the Doctor.\nYOUNGER LANKY: Pleased to meet you.\nPRISONER: #3: (OFF) I won’t scream. I won’t give you monsters the\nPRISONER: satisfaction!\nYOUNGER LANKY: Just one more, then it’s my turn.\nPRISONER: #3:\nYOUNGER LANKY: Poor lad. — Cybermen like a nice orderly queue. There’s one thing we’ve got in common. Course, I don’t mind swapping, if you want to get it over with...?\nDOCTOR: Well, I — (LOST FOR WORDS)\nYOUNGER LANKY: It’s alright, no-one‘1ll know.\nDOCTOR: Very kind of you, but really, I can’t.\nLANKY: Good man, that’s the spirit. —\nYOUNGER LANKY: Here we go! — Think happy thoughts, Doctor. That’s what I’1l\nYOUNGER LANKY: be doing. Thinking of a rainy day at the Pleasure Beach, when I was so high.\nCYBERMAN: Proceed to the evisceration machine.\nCYBERMAN: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 138\nYOUNGER LANKY: Right you are. Good luck, Doctor.\nYOUNGER FRANK: (WEARING CYBERSUIT — MUFFLED SPEECH UNTIL INDICATED) Wait. These prisoners may not be converted.\nCYBERMAN: Why?\nYOUNGER FRANK: Why?\nCYBERMAN: Yes, why?\nYOUNGER FRANK: Because... (DROPPING IMPERSONATION) the fella with the belly a good friend of mine!\nYOUNGER LANKY: Eh...?\nDOCTOR: Of course, he’s got a glittergun!\nCYBERMAN: Cybermen do not have friends. You are not a Cyberman.\nYOUNGER FRANK: (FX: FIRES GLITTERGUN. LASERY-TWINKLY SOUND) Eat gold-dust, you metal horror!\nYOUNGER FRANK: How d’you like that?\nYOUNGER LANKY: Captain Frank! Silly beggar, you came back for us!\nYOUNGER FRANK: Didn’t think I’d leave a chum behind, did you?\nDOCTOR: (GROANS) Only you got here a fraction early!\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: SCENE 93: INT. STOREROOM\nJAMIE: Here we go.\nFRANK: How d’you mean?\nJAMIE: Yon Cybermen need the Doctor to do what they want. And it’s us they’re gonna use to make him do it.\nLANKY: Maybe — but guess what, lads?\nFRANK: Lanky!\nJAMIE: Hang about — isn’t he supposed to be...?\nLANKY: Yeah, that Zennox hit us square in the chest unit.\nFRANK: Lucky, that.\nJAMIE: Eh?\nLANKY: Oh, it’s true that the Cap here rescued us from a Cyber- conversion unit — but the fact is, the tin beggars hadn’t quite got around to cutting me open...\nFRANK: Got there in the nick of time, old son.\nLANKY: Hey, now the secret’s out, I can disconnect this horrid voicebox...! (FX: CLICK FROM CHEST UNIT) (NORMAL VOICE FROM\nLANKY: HERE) Ahh. That’s better, eh?\nLANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 140\nLANKY: SCENE 94: INT.

Captain Frank, I’m very glad to see you!\nYOUNGER FRANK: (STRUGGLING TO REMOVE CYBERHEAD) Took the suit off a fallen Cyberman to get in here. Help us get the head off, Lanks, it’s an awful squeeze.\nDOCTOR: I’1l do it.\nYOUNGER FRANK: Much obliged.

Best we high-tail it out of here pronto!\nYOUNGER LANKY: You'd best come with us, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You go. There’s a friend of mine in the Super-Controller’s bunker. I have to rescue her.\nYOUNGER FRANK: ‘Her’?\nDOCTOR: Yes, ‘her’. Her name’s Zoe.\nYOUNGER FRANK: Now it’s not very modern, I know, but I can’t bear the thought of leaving a lady in trouble.\nYOUNGER LANKY: We’re with you, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 141\nDOCTOR: SCENE 95: INT. STOREROOM\nJAMIE: Yeah, but why go around impersonatin’ a Cyberman at all?\nFRANK: Well, it made Ms Zennox all the keener to hire us.\nLANKY: Besides, that’s how the Doctor knew us — as a Cyberman.\nJAMIE: The Doctor?\nLANKY: When we first met him, lad, all those years ago, on Telos. —\nJAMIE: Eh???\nLANKY: Couldn’t show our hand before the C-Class had taken him and Zoe back through the warp, ‘cos of — what was it now?\nFRANK: Causality, Lanks. — No time for all these damned explanations. Get us out of these Cyber-cuffs.\nLANKY: Need to use Glitterguns. I sent the boy out to fetch ‘em. —\nJAMIE: ‘Boy’?! What —\nLANKY: That’1l be him now!\nFINDEL: (RUSHING IN) Sorry about that. I nearly ran into a Cyber- patrol.\nJAMIE: Findel?! — Now, wait. He’s definitely supposed to be —\nLANKY: Luckily, Zennox didn’t hit him in the chest unit.\nJAMIE: Eh?\nJAMIE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 142\nLANKY: And I thought I was supposed to be the dim one. I’m not half- Cyberman — he is!\nFINDEL: It was at the Parapsychology Unit. The tutors persuaded some of us that the way to prove our devotion to the cause was to have ourselves part-replaced.\nJAMIE: So you’ve got a metal heart, and the like?\nFINDEL: A hollow heart, or so I thought. Until it was... filled up. Until I saw where I’d gone wrong.\nLANKY: No time for that. Pass us the Glittergun. We need to get these chaps free.\nJAMIE: Then what?\nFRANK: Then we take out the beacon, so your Zoe can do her thing.\nFINDEL: Zoe?\nLANKY: In the past, lad.

You have returned.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I see you. All caught up in cables. Hold on, I’1l try to find a way down.\nZOE: [POSSESSED BY SUPER-CONTROLLER] :\nZOE: That will not be necessary.

You know it cannot be — (GASPS IN PAIN, DISTRACTED)\nYOUNGER LANKY: What’s up with her now?\nDOCTOR: It.

Zoe, that’s brilliant!\nZOE: It’s not enough. The war will just go on. I can’t let that happen, not when there’s a chance to end the Cybermen for good!\nDOCTOR: How?\nZOE: I’m going to pull the fleet back towards Telos... only I won’t tell it to stop.

Is that it? Have we won?\nFRANK: Not yet, friend. There’s a sacrifice to be made first.\nLANKY: So sad.\nJAMIE: What’re you on about?\nFRANK: We were there, Jamie, old chum. On Telos, ten years back. With the Doctor.\nLANKY: Yes, and little Zoe.\nFINDEL: Zoe?\nFRANK: Brave, brave girl.\nLANKY: She’d taken over the Super-Controller, you see. So she could bring all those ships in warpspace down on Telos at once.\nFRANK: Boom, end of the war.\nLANKY: Only she’d be stuck at Ground Zero when they hit.\nJAMIE: So — what happened? The Doctor stopped her, right?\nFRANK: Can’t change the past, chum. We’ve done our bit.\nLANKY: All we can do now is let the sacrifice be made.\nFINDEL: No!!!\nFINDEL: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 149\nFINDEL: SCENE 101: INT.

Gemma Corwyn, killed by the Cybermen — oh, and so many others, on so many planets. One more death, Doctor! One tiny sacrifice, and that’s the end of it. So please, let the sacrifice be made!\nYOUNGER FRANK: Brave, brave girl. — Well, then, Lanks...\nYOUNGER LANKY: Yeah. Come on, Doctor — you heard her!\nDOCTOR: You go if you have to! If Zoe’s going to do this, she won’t be dying here alone!\nZOE: Doctor, be reasonable!\nDOCTOR: Reasonable? Rational? Logical? No.\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER [POSSESSED BY FINDEL]: No.\nYOUNGER LANKY: And now he’s back!\nZOE: No. No, he’s... I don’t understand. The Super-Controller.. he’s gone! It’s like... like a gate came down...\nDOCTOR: A logic gate...?\nDOCTOR: SUPER-CONTROLLER [POSSESSED BY FINDEL]: Yes, and I closed it! He’s gone from your mind, Zoe. Now, I’m in his, and he’s in mine!\nDOCTOR: That’s not the Super-Controller speaking. That’s someone else!\nYOUNGER LANKY: Yeah, but who?\nYOUNGER LANKY: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 150\nYOUNGER FRANK: Damn, this is confusing!\nYOUNGER FRANK: SUPER-CONTROLLER [POSSESSED BY FINDEL]: All brains, no heart — that’s what they used to say about us, Zoe.

Reaching out into the warp. Reaching out to the fleet...\nJAMIE: What’s Findel think he’s doing, puttin’ his head in the Planner like that? He’ll fry his brain!\nLANKY: Leave him be, Jamie.

How’d you get off Telos?\nFRANK: Well, the Doctor’s TARDIS was U/S. Only way off-world was in the old Star-Spitfire.\nLANKY: Bloomin’ miracle it didn’t get blown to pieces in the bombardment.\nFRANK: Up, up, away and home.\nJAMIE: Oh right. So the Doctor and Zoe — they’re on Earth now?\nLANKY: No...\nJAMIE: I get it, they’ve been here all along! — Oh, that Doctor!

Causality, that’s all that matters now!\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 157\nDOCTOR: SCENE 108: INT. PLANNER ROOM\nLANKY: He told us — ten years from then, that’s now, the past him would run into us on a planetoid in the Kuiper Belt.\nFRANK: Told us not to resist it when it came, but to go with the flow, right up until the moment he went off in a C-Class Cybership.\nLANKY: Him on his way to Telos, that was a sign that Time was flowing in the right direction. Makes it all worthwhile, being stuck in this Cybersuit for weeks.\nJAMIE: All this time — you knew how it was all going to go?\nFRANK: Had a hairy moment when I thought that Zennox was going to blast you and the Doctor to ash. But it all worked out in the end.\nJAMIE: You idiots, it’s not worked out at all! The Doctor and Zoe, they’re —\nFRANK: I know, old man.

The door’s practically hanging off.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nZOE: Oh dear. It’s as bad as you said.\nDOCTOR: I’d hoped there was a chance she’d have begun to regenerate herself. Enough to give us some protection, at least.\nZOE: Is she — well, dead?\nDOCTOR: Inert. She needs artron energy — time energy — to give the process a kick start. Or at least, to latch on to the time vortex. But this is fluid time. She’s adrift from continuity. She shouldn’t be here, and neither should we!\nZOE: There must be something we can do.\nDOCTOR: If Frank and Lanky didn’t make it out, to meet me in the future — that’d shut down this whole timeline.

Don’t you see — you getting involved is what’s going to make that happen!\nDOCTOR: In which case, the TARDIS wouldn’t be dead! No — your Doctor, he had the right idea. Run away!\nZOE: It doesn’t make sense. My Doctor, run away from the Cybermen?\nDOCTOR: Well, you saw him.\nZOE: What if it wasn’t an accident, his landing on that planetoid?\nDOCTOR: Yes, someone summoned his TARDIS so he could swap places with me.\nZOE: Exactly. The Cybermen are about to be destroyed because you swapped places with my Doctor. But my Doctor had to be on that planetoid for all of it to happen!\nDOCTOR: So...?\nZOE: So we have to close the circle!\nDOCTOR: What, by sending your Doctor a message, I suppose? “Come quick to Planetoid X, it’s the last of the Cybermen”?\nZOE: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: He’1ll never come.

The timeline is coming together, she can feel it!\nZOE: Because you’re about to send that message, yes!\nDOCTOR: Zoe, I do believe you're right...!\nZOE: Then you’d better get on with it. Because by my calculations, the fleet will hit ground zero any second now!\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 164\nZOE: SCENE 115: INT. SUPER-CONTROLLER’S CHAMBER\nZOE: SUPER-CONTROLLER [POSSESSED BY FINDEL]: Impact imminent. Come on! End the war! Come o [n!!!]\nZOE: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 165\nZOE: SCENE 116: INT. PLANNER ROOM\nLANKY: Findel. Look at Findel.\nFINDEL: (GASPS — DYING BREATH) Zoe...\nJAMIE: He’s gone.\nLANKY: That he has. The last casualty of the War.\nFRANK: We won’t forget.\nJAMIE: No, but he wasn’t the last, was he?\nLANKY: We don’t know that, lad.\nJAMIE: We do, though. (SNIFFS)\nLANKY: Come on. Nice cup of tea, then we’ll get you back home.\nJAMIE: Your Earth, that’s not my home, is it? My home, she’s a thousand years away. A dozen lifetimes or more.\nLANKY: Still, it’s the best we can [offer.]\nFRANK: (HEARING SOMETHING IN EAR) Sorry?\nLANKY: What’s that, Captain?\nFRANK: Nothing. I thought — (HEARS IT AGAIN) I don’t believe it...!\nJAMIE: Believe what?\nFRANK: Down the wire. In my ear. Jamie — it’s the Doctor!\nFRANK: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 166\nFRANK: SCENE 117: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nFRANK: COMING IN TO LAND.\nDOCTOR: There’s the Captain’s flyer now. And I do believe... yes, the\nTARDIS: is in exactly the same spot as it was when it first landed here.\nZOE: But is it over, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Cybermen have been defeated, comprehensively so. The final end! — Admittedly, there will be a few scattered survivors,\nDOCTOR: clinging to the fringes of extinction. But without the Super- Controller’s binding influence, they’1l be... unbalanced. A little emotional. They might even want revenge.\nZOE: That’s not what I meant. Whoever it was swapped you with my Doctor — they weren’t targeting the Cybermen. They were targeting you.\nDOCTOR: True, I indeed appear to have been attacked, by someone rather well-acquainted with my personal history. Well — they’ve failed, whoever they are. Pity I won’t remember.\nZOE: But you’re still here.\nDOCTOR: The timelines will take a while to adjust. Although the TARDIS looks to be almost back to her former glory...\nZOE: Yes, her roundels are nearly 3D.\nDOCTOR: So your Doctor will soon reappear. When he does, time will snap back — and you won’t recall I was ever here.\nZOE: But surely...\nDOCTOR: Big as your brain is, Zoe, it won’t be immune. — Ah! Here’s\nDOCTOR: Jamie now.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 167\nDOCTOR: See? All together again. Yes, very soon, everything will be exactly as it was before.\nJAMIE: I wouldn’t be so sure about that. (CALLING BACK) Frank, Lanky - I’ll be seein’ you, aye!\nZOE: Jamie, it’s so good to see you.\nJAMIE: He’s not told you, has he? About his Time Lords?\nZOE: Who?\nJAMIE: His people. Thing is, when our Doctor comes back, they’re goin’ to catch up with him. Turns out he’s a bad ‘un.\nZOE: Our Doctor?\nJAMIE: That’s what they think, anyhow. So when they catch him, they’re going to send us back. Me to the Highlands, you to the Wheel. They’re gonna make us forget, Zoe. All of it. All of our adventures. Like they never happened.\nZOE: Doctor — is this true?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nJAMIE: So I was thinkin’. Those fellers Frank and Lanky are leavin’ for Earth in a couple of hours. Turns out the Captain, he’s from a posh family. Owns half o’ Scotland, it turns out. The half of it that ain’t — what did he say? “Irradiated”, aye. — Anyhow, says there’s a castle there for me, if that’s what I want. Just to look after, like. But still, most o’ the time, I’1l be the Laird of McCrimmon. Me, a loch, a castle, and ten thousand acres of sky!\nDOCTOR: Ah, but will there be lasses?\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 168\nJAMIE: They’re my business, not yours. — What d’you say, Zoe? This is your time, pretty much. Space time. Reckon you’1ll fit right 27s\nZOE: There are people like me and Findel, people from the parapsychology unit. I think they’re not being very well treated. Perhaps someone should help then...\nDOCTOR: Perhaps someone should.\nJAMIE: What do you think, Zoe? Shall we go?\nZOE: I — I don’t know.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t work like that, I’m afraid. Look at my hand.\nJAMIE: Hey, it’s all gone see-through!\nDOCTOR: (FX: VOICE BEGINNING TO FADE) I’m being pulled back into my own timeline. Fading away like the Cheshire Cat.\nZOE: Jamie, if we’re going, we have to go now!\nJAMIE: But that means — we’ll miss our Doctor. We’1ll never see him again!\nDOCTOR: (FX: FADING) Look up at the scanner. There — that’s the ridge I fell from. That’s where he’1ll reappear. Any moment now.\nJAMIE: Perhaps we should hold on a moment, Zoe. Just to see he’s alright.\nZOE: No, Jamie. If you want to remember him, we have to go!\nDOCTOR: (FX: FADING TO NOTHING) You won’t remember me. But I’1ll never forget you. Dear Jamie; dear Zoe.\nDOCTOR: LAST OF THE CYBERMEN by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 169\nZOE: Doctor? Doctor! — Jamie, he’s gone! (FORGETTING ALREADY) He's...\nJAMIE: There! Did you see that, Zoe, on the scanner? — Lightning, on\nJAMIE: the horizon!\nZOE: The electrical storm is getting worse.\nJAMIE: And the thunder. Sounds like the Siege o’ Carlisle out there...\nJAMIE: THE END"
