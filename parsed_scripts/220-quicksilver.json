(BEAT) Thank you for sorting that out, by the way.\nDOCTOR: HELPS CONSTANCE PICK UP LETTERS. SHE SORTS THROUGH THEM.\nCONSTANCE: Letters. Postcards. (READING CARDS) I seem to have missed delivery of an urgent telegram message. Every morning for the past week.

I don’t mean to seem ungrateful. But I’ve been away too long.\nDOCTOR: (SHAKES HAND) Thank you, Mrs Clarke. For everything. You’ve been an exemplary travelling companion.\nCONSTANCE: Now, don’t disrupt that filing system I’ve put in place. You might stand a chance of actually attending to some of your correspondence at last.\nDOCTOR: I look forward to reviewing my post. And you have your own to deal with. That should keep you busy. For a while at least...\nANOTHER: AWKWARD PAUSE.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. Wait. Despite what you might think, this is not easy for me. I don’t do this lightly. I...

I’1l be overseas with naval intelligence. That’s all I can say. You go and look after your girls at Wavendon. The time will fly by while I’m away. All that marching up and down and whatever else they have you doing there. Filing, typing, translations. It all helps, I’m sure.\nCONSTANCE: And then, who knows, this beastly war may be six months closer to being over?\nHENRY: Indeed.

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTARDIS: SCANS AND BLEEPS.\nKINVAR: Have they gone?\nDOCTOR: I think so. (CHECKING CONSOLE) The only movement out there for the last ten minutes has been a messenger boy on his bike. And several pigeons. That strange communication sent your pursuers scurrying back to their ship. (CHECKING TARDIS READOUTS) Concealed in the vortex, just on the edge of local spacetime. Interesting technology. Hmm. I’d like to know who they are. But we should probably start with your name, young man.\nKINVAR: Kinvar. I am Kinvar. They are the Vilal.\nDOCTOR: Vilal? Can’t say I’m familiar with them. And they’ve certainly never come across a TARDIS before. But you seem to know me.\nKINVAR: I don’t ‘know you’ exactly. I only know about you. That you were here. In the countryside, a few months ago. I detected this wonderful machine. Then she vanished.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure my TARDIS appreciates the compliment. But we don’t tend to stay put for long. Bletchley was an exception.\nKINVAR: That’s right. Bletchley. I got there too late. You’d gone. Eventually I worked out you’d left with a ‘Mrs Clarke’. I thought she might come back, so I found her house. I kept watch over it. I met-\nDOCTOR: You’ve been spying on me?\nKINVAR: I made contact with the local authorities. I think they’re called ‘S.I.S’.\nDOCTOR: You’ve been in touch with the Secret Intelligence Service?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 24\nKINVAR: I thought that they could help. I had little to offer them... but I’d no need of it any more. They seemed excited at first. Talking about technological breakthroughs... But they didn’t really know much about you. Or your Ship. Then they became rather insistent.. I thought it best to get away.\nDOCTOR: Kinvar, what have you done?\nKINVAR: I traded... some of my technology for information. About you.\nDOCTOR: What?! Your technology has no business on Earth. Especially not now. This war is coming to an end. The last thing the planet needs is for it to start up again, with an arms race no-one has any hope of winning. (ANGRY) Of all the irresponsible idiocy!\nKINVAR: I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: And if you came here on the trail of Mrs Clarke, then your armoured friends could know about her too.\nDOCTOR: ACTIVATES DOOR CONTROL.\nKINVAR: What are you doing? We can’t go out there!\nDOCTOR: Come, or stay behind. I don’t care. But I do want to make sure my friend is safe.\nDOCTOR: EXITS.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING, OUTSIDE) And if you do stay in there, don’t touch anything!\nDOORS: CLOSE.\nKINVAR: (TO SELF) I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

The pilot - this ‘Doctor’ — may have dropped it outside. (HANDS INVITATION CARD TO VILAL\nGENERAL: )\nVILAL GENERAL: (TURNS OVER CARD) A primitive communication? Not the key, then.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: No. But it may be a key. There is biodata on this paper. Some too complex for our analysis.\nVILAL GENERAL: The Doctor’s?\nVILAL CAPTAIN: We think so. There is also a human trace. They may also know about the box.\nVILAL: GENERAL ACTIVATES CONTROLS.\nVILAL GENERAL: Then locate it. Commence scans for this biodata and for Kinvar!\nVILAL CAPTAIN: It appears that entering that vessel has removed him from local spacetime.\nVILAL GENERAL: Divert all remaining power to the vortex scanner.

Just the place for a holiday. (SOTTO) It must be him. It’s gotta be him!\nANA: Had you been at some kind of party, Miss Philips?\nFLIP: You could say that. And it’s Flip. Philippa Jackson. Well, Mrs Philippa Ramon now, I suppose.\nANA: I see, Mrs Ramon. Your fancy dress is most unusual. I have not seen this style before.\nFLIP: Yeah, it’s not fancy dress exactly. More a sort of... Never mind.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 38\nANA: Whatever you say, Mrs Ramon.\nFLIP: Actually, let’s stick with ‘Flip’.\nANA: I am sorry we have only gentlemen’s clothes in our shop.

I’m just having her search for any anachronistic signals, while running a cross-check on all the names and dates Kinvar has been able to provide.\nCONSTANCE: Is there anything I can do? There may be people I know from the military.\nDOCTOR: (COVERING WHAT HE’S REALLY DOING) Oh, don’t worry yourself. The\nTARDIS: has it all in hand.\nCONSTANCE: (THINKING HE’S MOLLYCODDLING HER) I can cope, you know. A Wren is always able to focus on the job in hand. Whatever personal concerns she might have.\nDOCTOR: I don’t doubt it. But your recent news constitutes something rather more than a ‘personal concern’. (BEAT) Constance, there\nDOCTOR: are stages of grief-\nCONSTANCE: I’d rather not speak about the matter any further. I will deal with things in my own way.\nDOCTOR: Very well. But I am here, if you need... anything.\nCONSTANCE: I am aware of that. (BEAT) Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Why don’t you see if our guest has woken from his nap? Show him the food machine. Oh!

That’s much better than that strange outfit you were wearing when we found you.\nFLIP: Yeah... I was just saying to your missus. I’m very grateful to you both for taking me in.\nHENRY: A confused young woman, wandering about the bombsites. As a fellow Brit I felt I should take responsibility! I don’t know if you remember anything from when I found you...?\nFLIP: Not much. Mr... Cook, was it?\nHENRY: Harry. And this is our shop. Our humble little clothing outlet. Vienna has been good to us. Which reminds me, I have a meeting with our... ‘supplier’ this afternoon.\nANA: Of course. You should go soon.\nFLIP: I hope I’m not in the way.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 42\nHENRY: No, no. Not at all. Just some restocking. Trade’s been very brisk of late.\nANA: But not so brisk that you cannot spend all morning reading a newspaper?\nHENRY: A fellow should keep up with international events. Especially now! We live in exciting times.\nFLIP: Yeah. So, the Second World War’s over, right?\nHENRY: (LAUGHS) It has been for a few years now. You’re certain she’s recovering, Ana? Miss Flip, are you sure you didn’t hit your head when you arrived? You were in rather a state.\nFLIP: No. I’m pretty sure I’m not injured at all. Just... you know... weirded out.\nHENRY: I’m not sure if I do know.\nFLIP: There is one thing.

I only wanted to get away.\nDOCTOR: Whatever your intent, that technology needs switching off and removing. I’m afraid I’1ll need you to accompany me to find it.\nCONSTANCE: Isn’t there a danger that those creatures will be waiting? Those...?\nDOCTOR: Vilal. Yes. I’m rather hoping they are.\nKINVAR: You want them to take me?\nDOCTOR: No. But if we meet them, then perhaps I can find out what exactly it is they want with you. You are remaining rather tight-lipped on the subject.\nDOCTOR: STRIDES ROUND CONSOLE. CHECKING FLIGHT.\nDOCTOR: See what I mean? Now, we shall be arriving shortly. Ah. Constance. You might like to change. Those colours may draw unwanted attention.\nCONSTANCE: You’re one to talk of colours!\nDOCTOR: I shall be wearing my Bletchley tweed.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 44\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, you know I’m proud of the Wren uniform-\nDOCTOR: (STOPS HER) Of course I do. It may be a little distracting, in peacetime.\nCONSTANCE: Nineteen-forty-eight. Of course... The war is over?\nDOCTOR: Where we’re going, Europe is just starting to work out how to rebuild after the chaos. Vienna is run by the Allied Control Council. Britain, Russia, France and America have divided the city into zones. There’s a shared international zone in the centre, which they patrol together. The ‘four in a jeep’ method.\nCONSTANCE: I understand. One soldier from each country.\nDOCTOR: It’s the best way to keep the peace. But even now, their tempers are starting to fray with one another. (ASIDE) Humans, they can’t help looking for new enemies...\nCONSTANCE: Then perhaps on this occasion, discretion would be advisable. (EXITING) I shall find some suitable civilian wear.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. (BEAT, CLOSE) Kinvar, while Mrs Clarke changes, I have something I want to show you...\nDOCTOR: TAPS CONSOLE.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 45\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 32: INT. CALLAHAN’S OFFICE\nTRAFFIC: OUTSIDE. BOYAROV KNOCKS.\nCALLAHAN: (CALLING) Come! (AS BOYAROV ENTERS) Ah, Major Boyarov. This must be important for you to come to my office in person.\nBOYAROV: (ENTERING) Major Callahan. I have news. Not good, I’m afraid.\nCALLAHAN: Don’t tell me. More bodies?\nBOYAROV: I am afraid it is true. Two more bodies. A dog led us to them.\nCALLAHAN: (SIGH) Where this time?\nBOYAROV: You might guess. In the bombed-out backstreets near Hoher Markt.\nCALLAHAN: The usual places haunted by black marketeers and pickpockets. Have you identified the victims?\nBOYAROV: The corpses were charred, but we believe they are two of our less savoury citizens. Known thieves and criminals. What does it matter if they kill one another?\nCALLAHAN: What matters is that we’re supposed to be keeping the peace.\nBOYAROV: PLACES FILES ON DESK.\nBOYAROV: Here. Our report. I have filed this also with the Americans and the French.\nCALLAHAN: TAKES FILES AND FLICKS THROUGH PAPERS.\nCALLAHAN: It’s the state of these bodies that concerns me most. What on\nCALLAHAN: Earth could do that?\nBOYAROV: Something powerful.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 46\nCALLAHAN: That’s what worries me. If there is a new weapon on the streets\nCALLAHAN: of Vienna, then we are all at risk.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 47\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 33: INT. VILAL SHIP\nQUICKSILVER: CLUNKING AND HUMMING VILAL TECHNOLOGY. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH\nTHE SHIP: SYSTEMS ARE DYING.\nVILAL GENERAL: Soon. It must be soon. Our ship is failing. We cannot wait much longer.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: The humans get closer. Soon their military forces will discover us. And we cannot move. We.. cannot kill them all.\nVILAL: GENERAL SLAMS FIST ON CONTROLS.\nVILAL GENERAL: (ANGRY GRUNT) This is not acceptable! This is not how Vilal die! Hiding, in the craters of some other war!\nVILAL GENERAL: FIZZING OF ZERITH COMMUNICATION.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: Another communication, General.\nVILAL GENERAL: And still our enemy taunts us.\nZERITH: (FX, DISTORTED TUNING IN) Vilal! Hear us! Wherever you are hiding! The Zerith have your home-world under siege. We are coming for you.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 48\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 34: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTARDIS: B/G HUM. DOCTOR ACTIVATES SCANNER.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Tell me, Kinvar. Do you recognise this man?\nKINVAR: Yes. That’s Mr Clarke!\nDOCTOR: Shh! And you last saw him, when exactly? It’s important you remember precisely how long before you hammered on my door.\nKINVAR: I met with him only a few times. The first was some time after I missed you both at Bletchley. But the last meeting, his people arranged — three days before you and Mrs Clarke arrived.\nDOCTOR: The War Office telegram predates that meeting. That’s what’s strange. Dead men don’t tend to keep their appointments.\nKINVAR: This picture. It shows a different name.\nDOCTOR: But it’s still the face of the man in the wedding photo in Constance’s hallway. I set the TARDIS searching through military records. S.I.S., as you said.\nKINVAR: He was very interested in the technology. Mr Clarke promised to help, but I had to keep moving. In case they came.\nDOCTOR: It’s not unknown for covert operatives to fake their own deaths in order to go undercover. But I can’t raise Constance’s hopes unless I’m sure. Let’s see what he was working on. (USES CONTROLS) The TARDIS has accessed the secret service files, declassified in the twenty-first century. I’m not breaking the rules of time travel exactly, just bending them a little...\nMONITOR: SCREENS FLICKS THROUGH IMAGES.\nKINVAR: Look! That is my device. The thing I gave him. (SOTTO) The Helm of Vilal.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 49\nDOCTOR: As I thought. The same technology. The same man. Henry Clarke is here in Vienna. Working on an operation... Codenamed Quicksilver.\nKINVAR: I do not understand.\nDOCTOR: Constance thinks her husband is dead. But all the evidence says he’s right here. Right now.\nPAPER: PRINTS FROM CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: Living as a Mr Harry Cook. I’ve printed off an address from Military Police records. (RIPS OFF PAPER AND PASSES IT TO KINVAR) File it with the other information. You and I will look into it properly later. I’1ll give Mrs Clarke some errands in the meantime.\nKINVAR: Yes Doctor, (PUTTING PAPERS IN FILES) Thank you, Doctor.\nCONSTANCE: APPROACHES ALONG TARDIS CORRIDOR.\nCONSTANCE: (OFF, CALLING) You really should organise that wardrobe. Formal wear alongside animal skins... Silver sequins, I ask you! It’s hard to find something practical.\nDOCTOR: HURRIEDLY SWITCHES OFF MONITOR.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE, TO KINVAR) One more thing. Not a word to Constance,\nDOCTOR: until I find out more.\nKINVAR: No, no. Of course. Whatever you say.\nCONSTANCE: (ENTERING) Here we are. What do you think?\nDOCTOR: I think that’s excellent timing, Mrs Clarke! We’re landing!\nTARDIS: STARTS MATERIALISATION.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 50\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 35: INT.

How’s the rag trade?\nHENRY: I can’t complain.\nCALLAHAN: Good to see British business flourishing in Vienna. I do like to keep an eye on my fellow countrymen. (BEAT, SIPS DRINK, CLOSE) And Quicksilver?\nHENRY: (CLOSE) Is up and running. It took a while, but those new machines can certainly do the job. The ‘other party’ providing assistance has gone quiet. I’m not sure if they’ve left.\nCALLAHAN: I don’t want to know, Mr Cook. (WALKS ACROSS BAR) Let’s take a private booth shall we? And you can tell me what you’ve heard...\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 51\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 36: EXT. OUTSIDE TARDIS, VIENNA STREET\nTARDIS: OPENS. DOCTOR AND CONSTANCE STEP OUTSIDE ONTO COBBLES\nDOCTOR: Here we are. Off the beaten track. Behind the Hofburg.\nCONSTANCE: Goodness. Even in the half-light, it’s all rather beautiful.\nDOCTOR: The parts of Vienna still standing are. Unfortunately many streets were reduced to rubble.\nCONSTANCE: By Allied bombs...\nDOCTOR: One can understand why the locals might be a little suspicious of foreign powers. Of any flag.\nCONSTANCE: So Doctor. Where do we start?\nDOCTOR: I thought you might investigate the local news agencies. Look for any unusual incidents. Kinvar and I have some other leads to check. Addresses... (CALLING) Kinvar! Come along! Bring that list!\nCONSTANCE: Jolly good. Should we meet back here at-\nKINVAR: STUMBLES OUT OF TARDIS, FALLING ONTO COBBLES, DROPPING\nHIS: FILE.\nCONSTANCE: (GOING TO HELP) Oh my word. Mr Kinvar!\nKINVAR: (MOANS) Vilal! They are here! Agh! My mind is under attack...\nDOCTOR: Some form of psychic reaction. It may even be his own technology causing it. If British Intelligence have Quicksilver up and running-\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 52\nCONSTANCE: Tend to the poor boy. You’re a Doctor, after all. I imagine you’ve much more experience of alien biology than I.\nDOCTOR: I may be able to block it, or at least reduce the effect until we can turn it off. (EFFORT) First, I’1ll get him back inside the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: DRAGS KINVAR TOWARDS TARDIS DOORS.\nCONSTANCE: If this is down to those creatures, then we clearly have no time to lose in finding them.\nDOCTOR: (DRAGGING KINVAR) I should have expected this. All we need is a shielding psionic crystal boosted with an energy lattice. I’ve quite a selection to choose from.\nCONSTANCE: PICKS UP KINVAR’S FILE.\nCONSTANCE: Is this all the information you have? Then I’1l make a start myself. (STRIDES OFF) Shall we say, back here in one hour?\nCONSTANCE: QUICKLY HURRIES OFF OVER COBBLES AND ROUND CORNER.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. The sooner we find Quicksilver and shut it down the better. Let’s get you back inside, young man. (REALISES WHAT SHE’S GOT, CALLING) Constance, no, not those files! Wait!\nKINVAR: (MOANS) Help me...\nDOCTOR: Ah. Too late.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 53\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 37: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nATMOSPHERIC: ZITHER MUSIC. FLIP WALKS ALONG.

Come along. We should get you back.\nHENRY: LEANDS FLIP ALONG STREET.\nFLIP: But I’m starting to feel like my old self. I can’t sit around and do nothing. I need to find out why I’m here.\nHENRY: You mean you remember where you came from?\nFLIP: I do. A bit.\nHENRY: And?\nFLIP: It’s not that I’m hiding anything. It’s more that you’d never believe me if I told you.\nHENRY: Let’s get you home. I promise. If nothing’s changed by morning, I’ll take you to someone in authority. I do have connections.\nHENRY: THEY WALK ON.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 54\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 38: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: HELP KINVAR BACK INSIDE.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT, SUPPORTING KINVAR) Here. Inside the TARDIS, you should feel better. I’1l have to put something together to shield you.\nKINVAR: (RECOVERING) Thank you, Doctor. What about Constance? She went looking for Quicksilver?\nDOCTOR: She did. And she has Harry Cook’s address as a starting point. (SIGH) I only hope it turns out for the best.\nKINVAR: Her husband’s alive when she thought he was dead. Surely that will be good news?\nDOCTOR: You're right. It may be a shock, but I think any reunion can only make her happy.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 55\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 39: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nCONSTANCE: EXPLORES VIENNA STREETS TO A ZITHER SOUNDTRACK.\nCONSTANCE: (TO SELF) Pressegasse. Which way now? Ah.\nCONSTANCE: FOOTSTEPS IN DISTANCE.\nFLIP: (OFF) Thanks Mr Cook. You’ve been too good to me.\nHENRY: (OFF) My pleasure, Philippa.\nCONSTANCE: (SHAKEN, SOTTO) Oh my. It can’t be...\nCONSTANCE: RUNS TO HIDE IN DOORWAY. CAT MIAOWS.\nCONSTANCE: Shush. Out of the way, kitty. I need your hideyhole.\nCONSTANCE: STEPS INSIDE DOORWAY. FLIP AND HENRY WALK ON PAST.\nHENRY: (AS THEY PASS) Here we are. Home again. I must say, we’ve done\nHENRY: rather well with that outfit. You look very elegant.\nFLIP: Why thank you, Mr C.\nHENRY: UNLOCKS SHOP DOOR, JUST OFF.\nHENRY: After you, Philippa.\nFLIP: (LAUGHS) Such a gentleman!\nFLIP: THEY ENTER SHOP. CONSTANCE STEPS FROM HER HIDING PLACE.\nCONSTANCE: (STUNNED) Henry... Oh, Henry.\nCAT: MIAOWS.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 56\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 40: EXT. SEWER ENTRANCE, VIENNA\nQUICKSILVER: DOCTOR AND KINVAR WALK ALONG COBBLES TOWARDS SEWER ENTRANCE.\nDOCTOR: Well then. According to the TARDIS scans, we need to go\nDOCTOR: underground, Kinvar.\nKINVAR: Underground?\nDOCTOR: Into the sewers, I’m afraid. (EFFORT)\nDOCTOR: OPENS SECTIONAL MANHOLE COVERS.\nDOCTOR: Still no ill effects?\nKINVAR: No Doctor. This pendant is working.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING INTO MANHOLE) A simple psionic shield. And the crystal should start to glow as we close in on the technology.\nDOCTOR: CLIMBS DOWN INTO TUNNEL.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING, BELOW) And I’m afraid the pain may return.\nKINVAR: FOLLOWS.\nKINVAR: (CLIMBING) I understand. It is my fault. The sooner we take this ‘Quicksilver’, the sooner we can go.\nKINVAR: THEY SPLASH INTO WATER BELOW AND START WALKING.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 57\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 41: INT. SEWER TUNNELS\nTUNNEL: ATMOS. RUNNING WATER IN DISTANCE. DOCTOR AND KINVAR WALK\nALONG: SEWER TUNNEL.\nDOCTOR: This way, I think. (EFFORT) A door off the main sewer.\nDOCTOR: PUSHES DOOR OPEN.\nDOCTOR: What have we here?\nKINVAR: Cables. Wires. Perhaps it is this city’s communication network?\nDOCTOR: I’d say it’s more than a ‘perhaps’. (EDGING INSIDE) It’s a bit of a squeeze. But there’s a way through.\nDOCTOR: EDGES INTO NARROW PASSAGE.\nKINVAR: (WINCES) Agh! I feel it!\nDOCTOR: Proof positive. We’re close.\nDOCTOR: THEY ENTER PASSAGE. DOOR CLANGS SHUT BEHIND THEM.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 58\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 42: INT. HENRY’S SHOP\nFLIP: WALKS THROUGH SHOP IN NEW COAT.\nHENRY: Very dapper, Mrs Ramon. Whoever picked that coat out had an eye for your hair.\nFLIP: (LAUGHS) Colour came out of a bottle, [Mr C.]\nDOOR: OPENS, SHOP BELL RINGS. CONSTANCE ENTERS.\nCONSTANCE: Well isn’t this nice. What a charming scene.\nHENRY: (GOBSMACKED BEAT) Constance? Constance, is that you?\nCONSTANCE: It is, Henry. I must say. Death does seem to agree with you. Such a glow in your cheeks. Not convinced by the moustache, though.\nHENRY: How did you find me?\nFLIP: Aren’t you gonna introduce us?\nCONSTANCE: And look. You’ve attracted a young admirer. Quite the ingénue.\nFLIP: Hiya, ‘Constance’, was it? You might have got the wrong idea. I’m Flip.\nCONSTANCE: PUSHES FLIP AWAY.\nCONSTANCE: I know what you are! And I have no wish to make your\nCONSTANCE: acquaintance!\nFLIP: Hang on. Am I missing something here?\nCONSTANCE: You are missing your morals. He is a married man.\nFLIP: I know! I’m a married woman!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 59\nCONSTANCE: Yet you flaunt your grubby liaison as if it’s something to be proud of!\nFLIP: Whoah there. Maybe you should go out and come in again? Cos I’m not getting any of this. And I don’t like how you’re talking to me.\nHENRY: Constance. Please. Let me explain. Philippa has just arrived. We hardly know each other.\nCONSTANCE: Even worse! Then I shall enlighten her. This, young woman, is my husband. Lieutenant Commander Henry Clarke of His Majesty’s navy.\nHENRY: The war is over, Constance.\nCONSTANCE: Yet you didn’t come home.\nHENRY: I tried. You weren’t there.\nFLIP: Listen. You two have things to talk about. Maybe I should-\nDOOR: OPENS, SHOP BELL RINGS. ANA ENTERS.\nANA: Henry? Who is this?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 60\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 43: INT. CABLE TUNNEL\nSMALLER: TUNNEL ATMOS. LOW HUM OF QUICKSILVER DEVICES.\nDOCTOR: This is it. Operation Quicksilver. Those silver boxes, laid along the cables.\nKINVAR: This is not my device. There are more. This was not my doing.\nDOCTOR: Never underestimate human ingenuity. The important thing is (EFFORT — REMOVING DEVICE) now we’ve found them, to get them far away from this time and place.\nKINVAR: Why are they here?\nDOCTOR: Of course. These are telecommunication cables. The British are using them to tap the Russian lines. No sooner does one war end, than another one starts. A very cold one. (EFFORT,\nREMOVING: DEVICES) If only they knew the true potential of these devices. Their psychic potential. They can change how people think. Instead of simply listening in on conversations with the Kremlin, they could actually influence them.\nDOCTOR: FINISHES REMOVING DEVICES AND STEPS CLEAR. HE FIDDLES WITH THEM, THEY PULSE AND HUM UNDER FOLLOWING.\nDOCTOR: There. That’s all of them. Whatever possessed you to give humans access to this kind of technology? It’s the last thing the Earth should get hold of at this point in its history. Communism, McCarthyism. They’ll manage all that brainwashing and paranoia quite well enough on their own, thank you very much.\nKINVAR: I didn’t! I gave Henry Clarke one component. (CRIES IN PAIN)\nDOCTOR: (STOPS FIDDLING) Are you all right, Kinvar?\nKINVAR: (RECOVERING) Yes. I think so.\nDOCTOR: Sorry. Just seeing how the controls work. (SETS OFF) Let’s find the quickest way out of here, shall we?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 61\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 44: INT. HENRY’S SHOP\nANA: This is Constance? I thought you had told her.\nHENRY: I tried. She wasn’t there.\nCONSTANCE: (TO ANA) You. It was you who wrote the letters. You who waited on the platform.\nANA: I am sorry you should find out this way. We did not mean to hurt you. Henry was not happy. But we have made a new life.\nCONSTANCE: Well isn’t that nice for you?\nHENRY: Don’t blame Ana. It was me. All me.\nCONSTANCE: And what else have you done, Henry? First bigamy. Now you’ve moved on to shop girls!\nFLIP: Oi! I’m not a shop girl. I work in a supermarket. (REALISES\nWHAT: SHE’S SAID) OK. Technically I am a shop girl. But that’s no reason to start assuming stuff about me! Me and him? No way!\nHENRY: Please Constance. We can talk about this calmly. (PULLS UP A CHAIR) Here. Sit down.\nCONSTANCE: Do not come near me, Henry. Or I will not be responsible for my actions!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 62\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 45: EXT. SEWER EXIT, VIENNA STREET\nQUICKSILVER: DOCTOR AND KINVAR CLIMB STEPS AND EXIT SEWER.\nDOCTOR: (BREATHING DEEP) Here we are. Fresh air at last.\nKINVAR: Where are we now?\nDOCTOR: No point retracing our steps underground. I found the quickest route to the surface. Which means, if my calculations are correct, we’re on the edge of-\nBOYAROV: The Russian zone.\nBOYAROV: BOYAROV AND SOLDIERS STEP FORWARD.\nBOYAROV: Your hands in the air, I think.\nDOCTOR: Please. I’m in the process of removing highly dangerous technology. I need to make it safe.\nBOYAROV: No. Put those boxes down.\nDOCTOR: Best do as he says, Kinvar. Please. Major...?\nBOYAROV: Major Boyarov. On the floor if you please.\nBOYAROV: DOCTOR AND KINVAR PLACE DEVICES ON COBBLED GROUND.\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) Why is the military mind never open to persuasion?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 63\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 46: EXT. OUTSIDE HENRY’S SHOP\nJEEP: DRIVES ALONG. CRASHING OF THROWN GLASSES INSIDE SHOP.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: You hear that? Sounds like a fight.\nMORE: COMMOTION IN SHOP, CROCKERY SMASHES, THROWN CHAIR. JEEP\nPULLS: UP.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: Ivanov. Arnaud — stay with the Jeep. Jenkins, with me.\nHENRY: (OFF INSIDE SHOP, CALLING) Please, Constance! Calm down!\nSOLDIERS: APPROACH AND KNOCK.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: (CALLING) Open up!\nCONSTANCE: (OFF INSIDE SHOP, ANGRY) Calm! My husband reveals himself as serial adulterer! You expect me to be calm?!\nFLIP: OPENS DOOR.\nFLIP: Hiya. You the police? I expect you want to know what all the\nFLIP: fuss is about. You’d better come in.\nSOLDIERS: ENTER.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 64\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 47: INT. HENRY’S SHOP (CONTINUOUS)\nSOLDIERS: ENTER. CONSTANCE HAS STOPPED SMASHING THINGS.\nCONSTANCE: There. I am calm. I am perfectly calm.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: Do you people need help?\nHENRY: I’m sorry, officers. There really is no need to trouble yourselves.\nANA: We can sit down and discuss the situation as adults. All of us.\nFLIP: Hang on. Don’t get me involved. I’m only here till the Doctor shows up.\nCONSTANCE: I beg your pardon?\nRUSSIAN SOLDIER: (OUTSIDE, CALLING) Someone is coming! Outside! Soldiers.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: That’s awful strange. First time I ever heard Boris speak a word of English.\nANA: (GOING TO WINDOW) There is something out there.\nHENRY: Away from the window, Ana!\nANA: A dozen men in armour. No. I think they are not men. Oh my. I see their faces, I do not think they are of this world at all.\nFLIP: Monsters... Russians speaking English... (REALISES) Ahh. I know what’s happening.\nVILAL: STOMP TOWARDS SHOP.\nFLIP: It’s the TARDIS. He’s here!\nCONSTANCE: What did you say, young lady?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 65\nAWKWARD: PAUSE.\nSUDDEN: VILAL WEAPONFIRE AND EXPLOSION OUTSIDE.\nHENRY: Oh no. Ana. Get upstairs.\nANA: No. I stay right by your side.\nSOLDIERS: RUSH TO DOORWAY. RAISING GUNS.\nAMERICAN SOLDIER: Jenkins, with me. (CALLING) Who’s there! Halt or we fire!\nVILAL: STOMP TO DOORWAY AND OPEN FIRE.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 66\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 48: EXT. BOMBED OUT VIENNA BACKSTREET\nFOOTSTEPS: AS DOCTOR AND KINVAR ARE MARCHED INTO QUIET DEAD END ALLEY.\nDOCTOR: I demand to speak to someone in authority.\nBOYAROV: You already are. I am the authority here.\nKINVAR: Please. Listen to the Doctor.\nBOYAROV: I listen to no-one where security is concerned. Beneath that street are communication lines to the Kremlin.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nBOYAROV: An admission of guilt! A quick and anonymous death is all your kind deserve.\nKINVAR: Our kind?\nBOYAROV: Spies.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 67\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 49: INT. HENRY’S SHOP\nVILAL: STOMP INSIDE.\nVILAL GENERAL: No more weapons.\nANA: No! We have none!\nCONSTANCE: We’re unarmed!\nVILAL GENERAL: It is time. We have come for her.\nFLIP: Who’s he talking about?\nHENRY: All right. But there was really no need to kill those men.\nVILAL GENERAL: Do not tell us what we can do.\nCONSTANCE: Henry? You know these aliens?\nFLIP: Aliens. Of course. (ASIDE, MEANING THE DOCTOR & HER WEDDING INVITE) He couldn’t just bring a ‘plus one’.\nHENRY: Take her. But leave the others.\nFLIP: Wait a sec-\nCONSTANCE: Henry? You can’t mean. (STEPPING FORWARD) No. You cannot take this young girl. (CRIES OUT, GRABBED)\nHENRY: PULLS CONSTANCE ASIDE AS VILAL ADVANCE ON FLIP.\nHENRY: Constance. Leave them be. They brought her here.\nCONSTANCE: Let go! You may be my husband, but you’ve no right to take hold of me like a common criminal!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 68\nANA: Henry said they need her alive. We have taken good care of her. I expect them to do the same.\nVILAL: SEIZE FLIP.\nFLIP: We are talking about the same blobs in armour who just blasted four people? (CRIES OUT) Agh! Get your hands off! (STRUGGLES)\nVILAL GENERAL: It is time for you to fulfil your purpose. Take that one too.\nVILAL: SEIZE CONSTANCE.\nCONSTANCE: Unhand me, you brutes! (STRUGGLES)\nANA: Henry?\nHENRY: No. Not Constance. That was not the agreement!\nCONSTANCE: Agreement?\nFLIP: You’re handing me over to these metal-plated mud-men?\nVILAL GENERAL: You are both friends of the Doctor. So the Vilal will take you both.\nCONSTANCE: (SINKING IN) This girl’s a friend of the Doctor’s...?\nFLIP: Well, duh.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 69\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 50: EXT. BOMBED OUT VIENNA BACKSTREET\nCONTINUING: SCENE 48, DOCTOR AND KINVAR MARCHED ALONG BACKSTREET BY BOYAROV AND SOLDIERS.\nBOYAROV: Stop. Here will do.\nALL: HALT.\nDOCTOR: We are not the spies here. We have just removed the spying equipment.\nBOYAROV: So. You admit that is what these devices are for! Men. Present arms.\nSOLDIERS: DRAW WEAPONS.\nDOCTOR: There really is no need for this...\nBOYAROV: One of you will die and one of you will talk. That is how it usually works with spies.\nDOCTOR: But we’ve already told you the truth!\nBOYAROV: Let us see if the story remains the same after the first bullets are fired. Ready weapons.\nSOLDIERS: RAISE WEAPONS.\nKINVAR: Doctor? They’re going to shoot us!\nDOCTOR: It does rather look that way.\nBOYAROV: Take aim.\nSOLDIERS: STEP FORWARD, RACKING WEAPONS.\nSOLDIERS: END OF PART TWO\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 70"

Did you know anything about this?\nBOYAROV: (APPROACHING) The first I knew was the smoke. We are supposed to be protecting the city. Not blowing it up.\nCALLAHAN: I must consider all possibilities.\nBOYAROV: Huh. What argument would I have with some Englishman’s tailor shop? I know where to get good suits. In the Russian zone.\nCALLAHAN: I wonder. (CLOSE) Boyarov, do you think this new weapon is involved?\nBOYAROV: (CLOSE) It could be. If this wasn’t a bomb-\nCALLAHAN: (CLOSE) I don’t think it was. There were reports of armoured ‘figures’.\nBOYAROV: (CLOSE) Then it is like nothing I have seen. (CALLING) You men, bring more water!\nSOLDIERS: RUNNING, OFF.

And I need to find out where Constance is.\nKINVAR: We’re going back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: We’ve done what we came to do. Found your dangerous devices. Let’s get them — and you - out of danger.

But I need help with the search...\nDOCTOR: PULLS ANOTHER DRAWER AND SORTS THROUGH BITS AND PIECES.\nDOCTOR: My storage system is a little erratic. Mrs Clarke was helping me reorganise.. ‘I’ for ‘Identification’.. papers, passports.\nDOCTOR: HE PULLS OUT ANOTHER ROUNDEL.\nDOCTOR: Now where did I put that... (FINDING PAPERS) Ah-ha!\nKINVAR: Please Doctor. I’d like to help.\nDOCTOR: HURRIES TO CONSOLE AND OPENS DOORS.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid you’d be a liability.

It rather pongs.\nFLIP: Nothing compared to the White Rabbit at kicking-out time.\nCONSTANCE: These are the city sewers. The water’s running that way. If I remember my European geography correctly, they empty out into the river. The Danube.\nFLIP: Don’t look at me. That’s another GCSE they didn’t let me do.\nCONSTANCE: I suppose if we follow the flow, we might find a way out.\nFLIP: Sounds like a plan. Let’s go.\nFLIP: THEY HURRY THROUGH FOLLOWING.\nFLIP: I’ll keep an eye out for any ladders. We might be able to get up to a manhole. I don’t really fancy swimming.\nCONSTANCE: Good idea. I must say, these tunnels are rather a grand affair.\nFLIP: Yeah. I’ve cleaned the loos in Freshgoods. It’s definitely a step up from that.\nCONSTANCE: I can tell you’re a friend of the Doctor’s, you know. I haven’t the slightest idea what you’re talking about!\nFLIP: Freshgoods. It’s a supermarket. Used to work on the cheese counter sometimes.

I simply need to find our operative.\nCALLER: (INDISTINCT, VIA PHONE) [‘Keep me informed’ ].\nCALLAHAN: Very good sir. Immediately I know more, I shall update you.\nPUTS: DOWN PHONE. DOOR BURSTS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE DOOR) Major Callahan? Sorry to arrive unannounced.\nCALLAHAN: What is the meaning of this?\nDOCTOR: BREEZES IN.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) But I rather thought in the circumstances, the British liaison for Allied security would want to see me anyway. So I took the liberty of circumventing procedure.\nCALLAHAN: What the devil? Who are you??\nDOCTOR: PUTS PAPERS ON TABLE.\nDOCTOR: My credentials.\nCALLAHAN: (CHECKING PAPERS) These are from Station X. Signed by... Good Lord.\nDOCTOR: You’11 find I have the highest security clearance.\nCALLAHAN: Nobody told me you’d be coming... (CHECKS PAPERS) Dr Smith.\nDOCTOR: Of course not.

Quicksilver is to be suspended.\nCALLAHAN: What? I just got off the phone to-\nDOCTOR: I know. And my clearance outranks the General’s.\nCALLAHAN: I’1l need to confirm.\nDOCTOR: Be my guest. This is a matter of public safety. Every minute you delay, lives are in danger. You have evidence already in the form of a smoking hole where Harry Cook’s tailor shop used to be.\nCALLAHAN: The attack was connected to Quicksilver?\nDOCTOR: Rather a coincidence if it wasn’t! First of all, I need a curfew put in place.\nCALLAHAN: Absolutely. I’1l get on to Allied Control. Major Boyarov can co-ordinate.\nCALLAHAN: PICKS UP PHONE.\nDOCTOR: And I’d like access to your agent, Lieutenant Commander Clarke.\nCALLAHAN: (STOPS MID-DIAL) You know about him too?

If the Doctor’s here, I want to see him soon as!\nCONSTANCE: You know about the TARDIS. So I take it, you may not be from this world and time?\nFLIP: Oh I’m definitely from this world. The year twenty-twelve though. I guess that’s your future: you seem a lot more at home here than me!\nCONSTANCE: I suppose this is near enough my native time. I met the Doctor during the war.\nFLIP: You mean World War Two? Nineteen-forties?\nCONSTANCE: Well done. You have some grasp of history after all.\nFLIP: Mum’s dad. My grandad. He was a kid when it started. But he used to tell stories about his dad. He flew planes.\nCONSTANCE: Your great-grandfather? You’re making me feel quite ancient.\nFLIP: Hey, I don’t suppose you might have met him? You never know.\nCONSTANCE: It would be highly improbable.\nFLIP: Yeah. I hate it when people do that... Like when you meet someone on holiday, and you say you live in London. And they say — “Oh, do you know John Smith, he lives in London too!” (BEAT) I don’t\nFLIP: even know the people next door.\nCONSTANCE: I suppose the past is a country all its own.

You’re my replacement are you?\nCONSTANCE: Difficult to say. The Doctor doesn’t exactly do things in chronological order.\nFLIP: Good point.\nCONSTANCE: I know.

But, you know, when you’re enjoying yourself, things always go too fast.\nCONSTANCE: (OFF) Time is relative, as the Doctor would say. Why did you stop?\nFLIP: (OFF) Wasn’t exactly my choice.

Buried in rubble on an insignificant world. The trade with the human failed.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: They adapted our components, named them Quicksilver. Used them for their own petty purposes. But someone else activated the psychic component.\nVILAL GENERAL: The Doctor?\nVILAL GENERAL: That is how they confused us. (BEAT) General, there may still be a chance. If Kinvar holds the Quicksilver devices-\nVILAL GENERAL: (INTERRUPTS) Yes! Use our remaining power. Contact Kinvar. It is our only hope. Even if it risks damaging his mind...\nVILAL: CAPTAIN ACTIVATES PSYCHIC SIGNALS.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: All power diverted to psychic signal. Contacting Quicksilver. Hailing Kinvar!

I don’t think you do want to hurt him.\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) No. Kinvar must be unharmed.\nKINVAR: (IN PAIN) They want me... want to force me to fight.\nDOCTOR: I think it's time you all told me exactly what’s going on.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 94\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 68: INT.

(BEAT) You were not observed coming here?\nANA: We never have been before.\nHENRY: I know what’s at stake.\nBOYAROV: This arrangement may be more trouble than it is worth.\nANA: You made promises, Major. Are you not a man of honour?\nHENRY: Our exit to the east may need a little hurrying along.\nBOYAROV: Such a shame for the British to lose such an officer. I imagine it will cost them quite a lot.\nHENRY: You want more money from us?\nANA: We have given all we have.\nBOYAROV: You want this done quicker? Then there are expenses.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 95\nHENRY: Take away the insignia and you’re a crook, Boyarov. Taking a cut from every black market deal any Russian has a hand in.\nANA: Henry!\nBOYAROV: Listen to Ana. That is not polite. If you wish me to help you enjoy a retirement in the countryside, then I need a little more.\nHENRY: I will not sell out my country. Is the money not enough?\nBOYAROV: Should Major Callahan hear of this defection, I do not think he would understand. One thing more I require. A sample of your new technology. Your listening devices.\nHENRY: There’s no such thing.\nBOYAROV: Come now. Even I have heard whispers of a name. ‘Quicksilver’. I am not asking for betrayal. Simply something our scientists can use.\nHENRY: It won’t be easy.\nBOYAROV: Nothing worthwhile ever is. It would be proof of your good faith. And as proof of mine, I will ensure Mrs Cook is looked after. Until you return. (DRAWS GUN, GRABS ANA)\nANA: A gun? (REACTS, GRABBED) What is happening?\nBOYAROV: Your papers, Ana. (TAKING PAPERS) You remain in the Russian zone until Mr Clarke completes this task.\nHENRY: You’re a disgrace to the uniform, Boyarov.\nBOYAROV: You think this is how to win favour?\nHENRY: I’m sorry. But if you threaten my wife-\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 96\nBOYAROV: (INTERRUPTS) As I understand it, your ‘wife’ is wandering elsewhere in Vienna.

We can be away from here and in Romania by tomorrow.\nBOYAROV: Listen. Ana speaks sense.\nHENRY: Very well.\nBOYAROV: I am a man of my word, Mr Clarke. Bring me that technology, and you will both be free to travel wherever you wish.\nHENRY: The components are in the cable tunnels behind our shop.

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nQUICKSILVER: HUMMING OF VILAL PSYCHIC DEVICES.\nKINVAR: I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: An explanation, please. I’m waiting.\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) Kinvar is necessary to us. We cannot function without him.\nDOCTOR: I’m going to need more of an explanation than that.\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) The Vilal are dedicated to war. We learned long ago that the best way to wage it was to divide ourselves. Strength, power, force, obedience. These qualities are distilled in our footsoldiers, the Vilal. Intelligence, logic, and cunning we split into another vessel.\nDOCTOR: Specialisation. Well, that’s one evolutionary option...\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) That vessel is Kinvar. We need him to direct this war.\nDOCTOR: Are you saying Kinvar is your... ‘battle computer’?\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) Every generation, a new Vilal Helm is prepared. Bred for the task. All knowledge, all history, all strategies are fed into the mind as it matures.\nDOCTOR: Like programming a machine.\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) When the Helm comes of age, becomes self-aware, then the psychic link is made. Kinvar fled before that was done.\nDOCTOR: Homilies involving eggs and baskets spring to mind.\nKINVAR: I awoke. I saw my future. Chained to this army. I did not choose to fight. So I ran.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 98\nDOCTOR: I see. You’re an organic A.I. More than that, a living being whose purpose is determined by directed evolution. But in your case, self-awareness provoked a new emotion. Fear.\nKINVAR: I am no coward. But I do not wish to kill.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes it takes more courage to turn away from the fight. You bred him too well, Vilal. Self-preservation may well be the purest evolutionary trait!\nVILAL GENERAL: (D) Our enemy hunt us to extinction. Without direction, without intelligence, we are easy prey. My expedition was Vilal’s last hope. But I am no strategist. I can only respond to stimuli, guess at the best course. Without Kinvar, we face defeat.\nDOCTOR: What’s it all for? Who is your enemy?\nDOCTOR: CRACKLING OF ZERITH TRANSMISSION BREAKING INTO QUICKSILVER SIGNAL.\nZERITH: (DISTORTED) (LAUGHS) We hear all! And we are close. We sense the final defeat of the Vilal.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 99\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 70: INT.

He’d waited all that time.\nCONSTANCE: Jared? Your young man.\nFLIP: He asked me to marry him. It seemed so romantic.\nCONSTANCE: Yes. It can often seem that way.\nFLIP: Before I knew it, we were making seating plans, ordering party poppers and booking a DJ. (ASIDE) I knew we should never have asked Dodgy Steve. (SIGH) It was a good party. Even Mum and Creepy Nigel were having a good time. I’d nipped outside, to clear my head, when this weird thing came for me. I woke up here.\nCONSTANCE: And ‘Mr and Mrs Cook’ found you and took you in. On behalf of those creatures.\nFLIP: They seemed nice. I never realised they were babysitting me for Trolls R Us, and whatever they want me for.\nCONSTANCE: Henry wouldn’t have let them harm you. I’m certain of it.\nFLIP: I’ve just thought... My wedding reception... it’s still going on. I’m supposed to be doing Gangnam Style!\nCONSTANCE: (SIGH) Is it worth it? For a night of champagne and dancing?\nFLIP: I wasn’t drinking.

Knocking about with another woman.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 100\nCONSTANCE: This morning I thought he was dead. Now, I wish that he were. (BEAT) No. That’s not right, Constance. You’re better than that. Stronger than that.\nFLIP: Too right. Jared is.. Well, he’s there. And he’s nice. But...\nCONSTANCE: There should never be a ‘but’ where your wedding day is concerned.\nZERITH: SCRAPING ALONG IN SEWERS, OFF.\nFLIP: Shh! Did you hear that?\nCONSTANCE: I believe I did.\nFLIP: Maybe we should get a shift on. Here, look over on the wall.\nCONSTANCE: Hold on. I’ve a torch... (CHECKS) Oh. I don’t. I usually do, only I don’t have my uniform.\nFLIP: Proper girl guide, aren’t you? And I’ve lost my mobile. Back in the reception hall with my lime and soda. I reckon we should just leg it up here!

Stolen... by alien parties.\nCALLAHAN: This is getting out of hand. Danger to public life and limb was never part of the plan. These ‘sleeping partners’ of yours...\nHENRY: They acted without my knowledge. I don’t believe they’re the same group as my initial contact after all.\nCALLAHAN: (LEAFING THROUGH FILE) Mr Kinvar. Back in London. You’ve seen hide nor hair of him for years, but instead you trust these unknowns.\nHENRY: The technology they gave us was the same, sir. We had no reason to believe-\nCALLAHAN: OPENS DRAWER AND TAKES OUT REVOLVER.\nCALLAHAN: National interests have been compromised. I think we need to move this interview to a more formal footing, Lieutenant Commander. (STANDING) Hands up.\nHENRY: Are you arresting me, sir?\nCALLAHAN: (SIGH) I said this cloak and dagger nonsense stunk to high heaven when I took it on. But you gave me assurances. All of you at §.1I.S. did. I helped establish your cover, gave you free rein. I didn’t expect it to blow up in our faces.\nHENRY: To be fair, sir. Neither did I.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 104\nCALLAHAN: We’ve handed you enough rope already, Clarke. I can’t afford to let you hang us all.\nHENRY: But sir-\nCALLAHAN: You give me no choice. I’1ll have to lock you up until we ascertain exactly who now has which pieces of our top secret intelligence materials!\nHENRY: But I must get back to Ana-\nCALLAHAN: COCKS REVOLVER.\nCALLAHAN: I’m afraid that won’t be possible just yet. (CALLING) Private Rogers! In here.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 105\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 74: EXT. SEWER ENTRANCE, VIENNA STREET\nMETAL: DOOR IS PUSHED OPEN FROM INSIDE.\nFLIP: (INSIDE) I definitely heard something behind me.\nCONSTANCE: I don’t doubt it. (EFFORT)\nCONSTANCE: WALKS OUT INTO COBBLES. FLIP FOLLOWS, METAL DOOR\nCLANGS: CLOSED.\nCONSTANCE: Actually, I’m not convinced they’re not ahead of us too.\nFLIP: What do you mean?\nCONSTANCE: Along the street. Sparkling lights. Quickly, this alcove.\nCONSTANCE: THEY DUCK INTO A DOORWAY. SHIMMERING AND FIZZING AHEAD AS MORE\nZERITH: APPEAR.\nZERITH: (DISTORTED AS IT APPEARS) Come, sisters! The Vilal will be ended here!\nCONSTANCE: (CLOSE) Idolomantis Diabolica.\nFLIP: (CLOSE) Beg pardon?\nCONSTANCE: Devils Flower Mantis. Always gave us a fright when they popped out of the bougainvillea.\nFLIP: Still not with you.\nCONSTANCE: I grew up in Africa. These creatures look rather like giant praying mantis. When I say giant, the biggest ones I saw were six inches.\nFLIP: This lot must be six foot! Are they see-through? Or is that ‘cos they’re not all here? You know, teleporting in.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 106\nCONSTANCE: It appears they’re made of glass.\nFLIP: We shouldn’t hang about to find out.\nZERITH: START MOVING TOWARDS THEM WITH SOUNDS OF SCRAPING GLASS.\nCONSTANCE: I quite agree! We should leave before they fully manifest.\nCONSTANCE: CONSTANCE AND FLIP STEP ONTO COBBLED STREET AND RUN.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits)\nQUICKSILVER: Page 107\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 75: EXT. BOMB CRATER, VIENNA BOMBED-OUT BACKSTREET\nDOCTOR: PICKS HIS WAY OVER RUBBLE.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) If you’re going to hide a crippled spaceship in Vienna, where better than a bomb crater?\nKINVAR: (CARRYING QUICKSILVER DEVICES, WINCES) I sense them, my kind\nKINVAR: are close.\nKINVAR: A HATCH OPENS IN CRATER BELOW AND VILAL STOMP OUT CARRYING\nKINVAR: GUNS.\nVILAL GENERAL: Doctor. Here. Beneath you.\nDOCTOR: Ah. General Vilal, I presume. Are all the guns absolutely\nDOCTOR: necessary?\nVILAL GENERAL: Guns are always necessary. We are warriors. Kinvar!\nKINVAR: (AFRAID) General... I-\nDOCTOR: No! Before that — have you done what I asked? Tracked down the\nDOCTOR: enemy?\nVILAL GENERAL: Yes. The Zerith are here and closing.\nDOCTOR: You've brought an alien war to Earth.\nDOCTOR: late to stop the killing.\nDOCTOR: I only hope we’re not too\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 108\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 76: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nZERITH: MOVING ABOUT THE STREETS WITH GLASSY SCRAPING AND\nSKITTERING: OVER COBBLESTONES. CONSTANCE AND FLIP TRY TO RUN PAST.\nZERITH: Come sisters. The Vilal are close. We shall hunt them down and eradicate them from this world.\nFLIP: (RUNNING) It’s no good. They’re everywhere!\nZERITH: (APPROACHING) You! Running creatures. Stop!\nZERITH: FLIP AND CONSTANCE HALT.\nCONSTANCE: (STOPPING) We should probably do as they say.\nFLIP: Way ahead of you there.\nZERITH: SURROUND THEM.\nCONSTANCE: (CALLING) Goodness me. You seem to have brought quite an army. In other circumstances, you’d be quite, quite beautiful.\nFLIP: (CLOSE) You really think that’s gonna work?\nZERITH: What are you?\nCONSTANCE: We are human beings. We are natives of this world and we will not be intimidated. I demand to know who you are and what your business is here.\nFLIP: Yeah. What she said!\nZERITH: We are the Zerith and our business is war. Where are the Vilal?\nFLIP: Lemme guess. They’re the shouty ones. Big on guns and armour.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 109\nZERITH: We will not rest until this planet is stained black with Vilal blood.\nCONSTANCE: We have just ended a long and bloody conflict of our own. I will not have you bring more suffering to our world.\nFLIP: You heard her. You can all crawl off back to where you came from.\nZERITH: (NASTY LAUGH) You creatures would stand in our way? You look so soft, so vulnerable. (REACHES OUT GLASS PINCERS) I wonder, ‘human beings’.

All I’ve done is buy some time. Now I really must go. (HEADS TO DOORWAY)\nKINVAR: Doctor, can I come? I don’t want to stay.\nVILAL GENERAL: Kinvar is ours!\nDOCTOR: (STOPS) And you’1ll do nothing to harm him! Vilal, you’ve seen I can provide help and protection?\nVILAL GENERAL: Yes. The Zerith are stalled.\nDOCTOR: Then do nothing until I return. Or else...\nVILAL GENERAL: Or else what, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I shall be very cross. And nobody wants that.\nVILAL GENERAL: Is that all you threaten us with? Your anger?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Don’t you see? I’m not threatening you. I’m offering to help. I’m simply asking that you don’t wire Kinvar’s brain into your systems quite yet. Not until we’ve talked about alternatives.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 113\nVILAL GENERAL: I see. In any case, we cannot. We do not have the Helm.\nDOCTOR: The Helm?\nKINVAR: My psychic connector. It was the first thing I got rid of. I gave it to Henry Clarke in London. His British Intelligence Service found it most interesting.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it was in the §.1I.S. files... I should track it down and take a look.\nVILAL GENERAL: Agreed.\nDOCTOR: Good. I promise you this, Kinvar. Nobody will force you to do anything. Not while I’m around.\nKINVAR: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: EXITS SHIP\nDOCTOR: (GOING OFF) Now, you need reinforcements to hold the Zerith at bay. And I know where to find them.\nZERITH: (FX, DISTORTED VIA SCANNERS) Vilal! We are coming!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 114\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 79: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nQUICKSILVER: CONSTANCE AND FLIP RUN ALONG STREET.\nFLIP: (RUNNING) Do you think they’1ll come after us?\nCONSTANCE: (RUNNING) They’re more concerned about their real enemy. We need to find the TARDIS. (SLOWING) ‘Braunerstrasse.' (‘brown-\nCONSTANCE: ur-strass’) I recognise that street name.\nFLIP: (SLOWING) Shame I never bought an A to Z.\nCONSTANCE: At the end of this road is a square. And beyond that-\nDOCTOR: RUNNING IN DISTANCE.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING, OFF) Constance!\nDOCTOR: FLIP AND CONSTANCE CHANGE DIRECTION.\nFLIP: (RUNNING) I don’t think we need to go that far!\nCONSTANCE: (RUNNING) Doctor!\nCONSTANCE: THEY RUN TO MEET UP...\nFLIP: (BREATHLESS) Running. We meet up again after all this time and we're running. Typical!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Flip? Philippa Jackson! What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: THEY ALL STOP AND CATCH THEIR BREATH.\nFLIP: I appreciate the thought, Doctor. I do. But to be completely honest, just towels would have been nice. Wine glasses... a big sieve, maybe. Anything off the wedding list really... But no, you had to get me the flamin’ nineteen-forties!\nDOCTOR: Flip. I had no idea. What happened?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 115\nFLIP: I was hoping you could explain!\nDOCTOR: (REALISES) Ah. Their leverage. It was you. I dropped your invitation. The Vilal respond to stimuli, choose the obvious course, no matter how illogical.\nFLIP: Nope. Still not getting it. Nothing changes, eh?\nCONSTANCE: Might the reunion wait until we’re under cover and safe?\nDOCTOR: Good point, Mrs Clarke. (SETTING OFF) This way.\nDOCTOR: FLIP AND CONSTANCE FOLLOW.\nCONSTANCE: But the TARDIS is along there.\nDOCTOR: Well remembered. But we need practical assistance. Major Callahan’s headquarters.\nCONSTANCE: There were huge mantis creatures. Vicious things.\nDOCTOR: The Zerith. I’ve scrambled their transporter signals.\nFLIP: They’re having a barney with those Iron-man trolls.\nDOCTOR: Who are now our allies. It won’t take the Zerith long to break through in force. We need to protect the people of Vienna.\nFLIP: You think more of those glass-hoppers are coming?\nDOCTOR: I know they are, Flip.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 116\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 80: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nFINAL: FEW ZERITH WEAPONRY BLASTS, AS SKIRMISH ENDS.\nZERITH: You are all but defeated.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: (WOUNDED) So are you. Four of you remain.\nZERITH: While all of your rabble is dead. I have more sisters coming. We will outnumber you here as we do in our home system. Your world is surrounded. We came for the cowards who ran.\nVILAL CAPTAIN: We did not run. We came here seeking victory.\nZERITH: A pity you will not live to find it. (CALLS) Kill this last one.\nZERITH: FIRE WEAPONS.\nCRACKLING: ZERITH SIGNALS.\nZERITH: Where are my sisters? Why can they not pass through the vortex? Who interferes?!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 117\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 81: INT. CORRIDOR, BRITISH HQ\nCALLAHAN: LEADS DOCTOR, CONSTANCE AND FLIP ALONG CORRIDOR BUSTLING WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL.\nCONSTANCE: (HURRYING AFTER CALLAHAN) My husband is in custody, Major Callahan? Whatever else he may be, Henry is no traitor.\nCALLAHAN: Love does strange things to men’s loyalties, Mrs Clarke.\nCONSTANCE: You don’t need to tell me that.\nFLIP: (CLOSE, TO DOCTOR) Doctor, her husband’s shacked up with some other woman. She thought it was me at first!\nDOCTOR: Oh Constance. I’m sorry. I had no idea-\nCONSTANCE: I know you’ve no idea when it comes to certain things, Doctor.\nFLIP: You can say that again.\nFLIP: THEY WALK BY HENRY’S CELL.\nCALLAHAN: He’s in there.\nCALLAHAN: THEY STOP. HENRY COMES TO THE BARS.\nHENRY: (JUST OFF) Constance! Please.\nCONSTANCE: (STOPPING) Might I have a moment?\nCALLAHAN: A moment. No more.\nFLIP: Come on, Doctor. Looks like everyone’s going through here. (HEADING OFF) Ooh. Look at all the uniforms!\nFLIP: BUSTLES THE DOCTOR OFF TOWARDS OPERATIONS ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Major? We’ll be waiting for you. Please hurry. (FOLLOWS FLIP)\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 118\nHENRY: Constance. Please. (SOTTO) You’ve got to persuade the Major to let me out.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry, Henry. But one makes one’s own fortune in war. And one must live with the consequences. — We were going to your\nCONSTANCE: operations room, Major?\nCONSTANCE: WALKS ON.\nHENRY: Constance!\nCALLAHAN: Pity. I was hoping someone might be able to talk some sense into him. I’ve had no luck. Rogers, keep an eye.\nROGERS: Sir!\nCALLAHAN: The rest of you men, with me.\nSOLDIERS: Sir!\nSOLDIERS: CALLAHAN AND SOLDIERS WALK ON.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 119\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 82: INT. OPERATIONS ROOM.\nCONSTANCE: ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: Constance?\nFLIP: You OK?\nCONSTANCE: Don’t fuss. Either of you. We’ve a job to do.\nCALLAHAN: ENTERS WITH TROOPS.\nCALLAHAN: I’ll get on to my counterparts in the French and American zones. What you say appears to be true: I’ve reports of an ‘alien engagement’. Shots fired. We need to muster the troops.\nDOCTOR: Please, Major. We simply need a show of numbers. Do not antagonise them. Your visitors are only interested in each other. The human race is an irritation. But one they have no qualms about removing if it gets in their way. Defensive measures only!\nCALLAHAN: I’1l make that decision once we know what we are dealing with. Wren Clarke? You wanted to see the city maps.\nCALLAHAN: CONSTANCE AND CALLAHAN LOOK OVER MAPS.\nCONSTANCE: Yes sir, this is where Philippa and I saw the mantis creatures gathering.\nCALLAHAN: Most useful. I’1l take every man I have available, establish a perimeter, along here.\nDOCTOR: And Major, I believe you have a device in your safe which is vital for the safety of this world.\nCALLAHAN: First things first, Doctor. (EXITING, CALLING) Sergeant! Have the troops fall in! Everybody, outside now!\nCALLAHAN: HEADS OUT WITH MARCHING TROOPS.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 120\nDOCTOR: I’1l check outside. Zerith forces could break through at any time. (SOTTO) And I still need to come up with some alternative plan...\nFLIP: (CLOSE) What can I do Doctor? I feel like a spare wheel with all this G I Joe stuff.\nDOCTOR: Come with me, Flip. There’s a lost soul in need of some\nDOCTOR: guidance.\nFLIP: You think I’1l be any use?\nDOCTOR: You’ve never let me down so far.\nFOLLOW: DOCTOR AND FLIP EXITING TO CORRIDOR.\nFLIP: (WALKING) Just like old times. Back in the thick of it.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Flip. It’s good to see you.

It is Rogers, isn’t it?\nROGERS: Sir.\nHENRY: I expect you’d rather be out there with all the others than babysitting me. (BEAT, NO REPLY. COUGHS) My mug’s empty. I’m parched. Any chance of a refill? (BEAT, NO REPLY) Honestly. What harm could it do? (BEAT) (SIGHS, CHANGES SUBJECT) You were here for the liberation, son?\nROGERS: Yes sir.\nHENRY: We did a good thing. A good thing. Do you think it was worth all those years of sweat and blood?\nROGERS: We beat ‘em, sir.\nHENRY: No. We freed them. They’re people. Just like you and I. Freed\nHENRY: from the tyranny of their leaders. We need to rebuild. Across\nHENRY: all of Europe. East and west. That’s what it’s all about, eh.\nHENRY: The next generation. And the one after that. (BEAT) You have a girl at home, Rogers?\nROGERS: Yes sir.\nHENRY: What’s her name?\nROGERS: Elaine.\nHENRY: Then you make sure when you get home, you give Elaine the biggest hug, the biggest smooch, eh?\nROGERS: I plan to.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 122\nHENRY: You set about building another generation. And we won’t have to go through this bloody business again. (COUGHS)\nROGERS: Yes, Sir. (BEAT) You wanted water, sir? I’ve a canteen here.\nSLOSHING: AS ROGERS GETS OUT WATER CANTEEN.\nHENRY: That would be very civilised of you.\nROGERS: GOES TO CELL BARS, PUTS KEYS IN LOCK.\nROGERS: Step away from the bars sir.\nHENRY: Of course.\nHENRY: STEPS BACK. ROGERS UNLOCKS CELL AND STEPS INSIDE,\nUNSCREWING: LID OF CANTEEN...\nROGERS: Here. I don’t suppose it’1ll do any- (CRIES OUT, AS HENRY\nATTACKS: )\nHENRY: LUNGES FORWARD AND PUNCHES ROGERS, WHO FALLS. WATER CANTEEN AND KEYS CLATTER TO FLOOR.\nHENRY: Terribly sorry, Rogers. You’1ll wake up with a headache, but I’1l make sure the Major knows it wasn’t your fault.\nHENRY: GRABS KEYS AND RUNS FROM CELL, ALONG CORRIDOR.\nHENRY: Now...

I’1ll fetch this young man.\nFLIP: You setting me up on a date?\nDOCTOR: It should be safe. Defended. There are plenty of troops about.\nFLIP: I did notice.\nLAND: ROVER PULLS UP NEARBY.\nDOCTOR: Ah. (CALLING) Major Callahan!\nCALLAHAN: (GETTING OUT) Doctor Smith! Everyone available is on the streets.\nFLIP: Where’s Connie?\nDOCTOR: ‘Connie’?! — Mrs Clarke was with you, Major.\nCALLAHAN: She was. But once she’d filled me in on the enemy’s location, she left. I thought she’d come to you.\nDOCTOR: I suspect she may have unfinished business with the occupant of your cell. Please. The device in your safe. We’1ll need it. Bring it here as soon as you can.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 124\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 85: INT.

No time to explain!\nHENRY: RUNS THROUGH A DOOR, CLOSING IT AND LOCKING IT BEHIND.\nCONSTANCE: RUNS UP TO THE DOOR AND RATTLES HANDLE.\nCONSTANCE: (CALLING) Henry! What are you doing?!

This is Kinvar.\nFLIP: Hiya.\nKINVAR: Hello.\nDOCTOR: You might want to enlighten Flip as to your predicament. She’s a very level-headed young woman. Sometimes.\nDOCTOR: FLIP AND KINVAR MOVE OFF. CALLAHAN APPROACHES.\nCALLAHAN: Doctor Smith! I’ve had word from HQ. Clarke’s gone!\nDOCTOR: Gone?\nCALLAHAN: Escaped. And he’s raided my safe.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nCALLAHAN: He took the item Mr Kinvar handed over to him back in England.\nDOCTOR: The Vilal psychic connector... The device we need.

Well, you always did like a fairground.\nHENRY: Constance, you can’t stay.\nMILITARY: VEHICLES DRIVING OFF OUTSIDE.\nCONSTANCE: If you’re meeting the Russian major, he’s presently occupied. I thought I’d join you for a ride around the ferris wheel until he’s free. I’ve paid the fare.\nFERRIS: WHEEL STARTS TURNING.\nHENRY: This is far too dangerous. Perhaps later-\nCONSTANCE: No, Henry.

FURTHER OFF, TROOPS ASSEMBLE\nFLIP: The Doctor said you’d a difficult choice to make.\nKINVAR: Yes. I ran away, you see.\nFLIP: Been there. Done that.\nKINVAR: From a war?\nFLIP: No. I guess I ran away from... whatever was mapped out for me. didn’t want to just go through the motions. It was worth it. But you have to go home in the end. And face it. It might be different, it might not be as bad as you think.\nKINVAR: This is bad. They want me to fight. To kill.\nFLIP: That’s pretty bad. Sometimes you do things ‘cos it’s what’s expected of you. But if you’ve changed, what you do might be different... (BEAT) You’re pretty fit for an alien warlord. I like your hair. Shimmering silver. Wish mine could do that.\nKINVAR: This is... not relevant.\nFLIP: No. Don’t suppose it is. (SOTTO) And I’m a married woman. Shouldn’t even be looking.\nKINVAR: What?\nFLIP: Doesn’t matter. What does matter is, you’ve a job to do.\nVILAL: GENERAL APPROACHES.\nFLIP: Him again.\nVILAL GENERAL: Kinvar. You must fulfil your destiny.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 129\nFLIP: Oi. Thicko. You went to all that trouble dragging me through Space and time to threaten the Doctor. If you’d just told me what was going on, we’d have sorted all this a lot quicker. You wanted help? You only had to ask!\nVILAL GENERAL: Without Kinvar, our strategies are... flawed.\nKINVAR: All right. I’1l come.\nVILAL GENERAL: Good. But without the Helm of Vilal we can do nothing. It is lost.\nFLIP: See what I mean? Thick! You scanned space and time for me. Surely you can x-ray a couple of streets for your own lost property?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 130\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 90: INT. FERRIS WHEEL CARRIAGE\nFERRIS: WHEEL CONTINUES ROUND.\nCONSTANCE: First things first, Henry. You have the alien device?\nHENRY: Here. Major Boyarov wanted it.\nCONSTANCE: A foreign power? I can’t believe you’d hand a British Intelligence asset over to them.\nHENRY: It can’t do anything. Not without the aliens.\nCONSTANCE: The aliens on the streets below? Let’s worry about that later. (BEAT) What happened, Henry?\nHENRY: We won the war. I did my bit. I wanted a life in peacetime.\nCONSTANCE: What happened to us?\nHENRY: I’d always meant to say goodbye. Did you get my messages?\nCONSTANCE: ‘Remain constant’?\nHENRY: I wanted you to know. I was going to come home. To explain.\nCONSTANCE: You think I’d sit and listen to your explanations? To hear that my husband had fallen in love with someone else? That my life was not what I thought it was? That everything I thought we had was a lie?\nHENRY: (STRUGGLING TO EXPLAIN) Ana was... When you work with someone in that intensity... that danger...\nCONSTANCE: So. I wasn’t thrilling enough for you?\nHENRY: We married young, Constance. I was in service. Always away.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 131\nCONSTANCE: I should have known better than to have my head turned by a dashing sub-lieutenant. Straight from university, I’d never seen London. I’d barely met any men.\nHENRY: Are you saying I took advantage?\nCONSTANCE: No. I’m saying... You should have had the decency to let me know.\nHENRY: (BEAT) Yes. I should.\nCONSTANCE: You had them tell me you were dead.\nHENRY: It was something the service could do. I thought it might be easier that way.\nCONSTANCE: Easier for whom? (BEAT) Make any excuse you wish. We were too young. We were too busy. The fact of the matter is, if you want a marriage to last, you have to work at it. And you stopped working, Henry. I never did.\nHENRY: I’m sorry.\nCONSTANCE: Is that all?\nHENRY: ‘Sorry’ is all I have.\nCONSTANCE: Very well. (BEAT) Then give me that device.\nHENRY: No. I can’t. I need to get Ana to safety.\nCONSTANCE: You think that is a persuasive argument? For me?\nHENRY: She’s having my baby, Constance. Ana is pregnant.

Perhaps if we could have had children-\nCONSTANCE: We couldn’t. If we could, it would have happened before.\nHENRY: Constance. I don’t blame you for any of this.\nCONSTANCE: Good. I blame you.\nHENRY: It’s nobody’s fault. Things happen.\nCONSTANCE: Things do not just happen! We do our duty. We do not drift through this world without control, without influence over the events that surround us. You didn’t trust me sufficiently to talk to me. We might have found a way through. We very probably would not. But my greatest disappointment is that you didn’t even grant us that chance. (BEAT) I am asking that you listen to me now.

Perhaps afterwards, you can take it. I will do everything in my power to make sure you, Ana and the child she’s carrying are safe. But I can only begin to do that by saving the world first. It’s what I do now.\nHENRY: Constance. There are creatures climbing the wheel.\nHENRY: DRAWS REVOLVER. CONSTANCE LOOKS OUT.\nCONSTANCE: Oh no. It may be too late. Do you trust me, Henry?\nHENRY: I trust you, Constance. Here.\nCONSTANCE: No. You get that device to the Doctor. Give me your gun, Henry. I’1ll draw their attention, lead them along the wheel while you disembark.\nHENRY: HANDS HER HIS GUN. CONSTANCE PULLS OPEN DOOR.\nHENRY: You think you can?\nCONSTANCE: I know I can. (CLIMBING OUT) This is also what I do now. Ona fairly regular basis.\nHENRY: Constance.

Is she a secret weapon too?\nCONSTANCE: No. But if you look a little higher...\nGROUND: SHAKES AS GIANT DOCTOR AVATAR APPROACHES.\nDOCTOR: (BOOMING FX) Cease your firing, I command you all. Zerith and Vilal alike! Hear me!\nWEAPONFIRE: STOPS, VILAL AND ZERITH MOVE IN CONFUSION.\nFLIP: 0... M.. G.. What happened? The Doctor’s the height of a house! And what’s he wearing? I thought the coat was bad enough...\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 141\nCONSTANCE: Hush, Philippa. A uniform has its uses.\nZERITH: (OFF) What are you? Why do we obey?\nDOCTOR: (FX) I am a Time Lord! Lord President of Gallifrey, no less. We are watchers of the universe, our view spans all of time and Space. You can only imagine the power we wield.\nFLIP: That collar... that hat! If that’s how they posh-up on his planet, I’m glad he didn’t come to the wedding after all. He’d have shown me right up!\nCONSTANCE: Shh!\nVILAL GENERAL: (OFF) We obey, o powerful one.\nDOCTOR: (FX) And what of you, Zerith? Do you hear me? (FX, EVEN MORE\nEPIC: DISTORT) Or do I need to increase the frequency?\nZERITH: (CRIES IN PAIN, FX) No, no we hear!\nECHOING: FOOSTEPS AS DOCTOR STRIDES ACROSS STREET.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 142\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 99: INT. VILAL SHIP\nKINVAR: ENTERS THE SHIP. QUICKSILVER DEVICES ARE PULSING.\nKINVAR: Doctor? You are here in the Vilal ship?\nDOCTOR: (CONCENTRATING) I am. It’s where Quicksilver works best. Influencing how people think. I’ve forced a ceasefire at any rate. But what happens next is up to you both.\nKINVAR: But out there...\nDOCTOR: LS a psychic projection. Tell me Kinvar, during your time here, did you come across a book called The Wonderful Wizard of O02?\nKINVAR: Um. No.\nDOCTOR: Smoke and mirrors. Some small embellishment to the truth, and a grand facade. Quicksilver lets me persuade both sides I ama force to be reckoned with.\nKINVAR: (LAUGHS) Oh, but you are, Doctor!\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 143\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 100: EXT. VIENNA STREET\nPSYCHIC: PULSING THROUGHOUT.\nDOCTOR: (FX) One more shot and you will feel the wrath of Gallifrey. Ten million years of absolute power — visited upon the houses of Vilal and Zerith. Is that what you want?\nVILAL GENERAL: Heed the Doctor. We agree a ceasefire. Will the Zerith accede?\nZERITH: (FX) We will consider your advice...\nDOCTOR: (FX) I’d do more than that.\nVILAL GENERAL: We would come to terms.\nDOCTOR: (FX) A treaty would be a good start. I am willing, as a representative of Gallifrey’s High Council, to help both sides come to agreement.\nDOCTOR: Look at this world where you make your stand. They have just ended years of bloody conflict. Finally, they have done what you must do. Stopped killing. Come to an understanding. A détente.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t mean all differences are resolved overnight. Some may never be. Look to the humans. War can be ‘cold’ as well as the heat of battle. There are far fewer casualties that way. Major Callahan, Major Boyarov. I believe you can both attest to that fact?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 144\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 101: EXT. SUSPENSION BRIDGE (CONTINUOUS)\nCALLAHAN: That’s true.\nBOYAROV: He has a point.\nCONSTANCE: I think you gentlemen should show a little more enthusiasm than that. Lives are at stake.\nFLIP: Yeah. How about we try that again? Once more with feeling?\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 145\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 102: EXT. VIENNA STREET (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: (FX) Gentlemen?\nCALLAHAN: (CALLING) Yes! It must be done. One must sit down with one’s enemy. Look them in the eye.\nBOYAROV: (CALLING) You can all the while keep a loaded weapon on the table. If it must be done, it can be done this way. Until trust is earned.\nDOCTOR: (FX) Throw down your weapons, and we can start. (BEAT) Which of you will take the first step?\nZERITH: (D) Throw down our arms?\nVILAL GENERAL: Throw down our arms. Yes.\nVILAL GENERAL: VILAL, THEN ZERITH THROW DOWN WEAPONS.\nDOCTOR: (FX) You see? It is possible.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 146\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 103: INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE\nSTEAM: TRAIN IN MOTION. HENRY GENTLY WAKES ANA.\nHENRY: Ana. We are almost there.\nANA: (WAKING) It is so long since I was in Bucharest.\nHENRY: That’s the idea. No-one knows us. We can start afresh. All three of us.\nANA: Your Constance. She helped arrange this?\nHENRY: Yes.\nANA: She is a remarkable woman. Henry Clarke has a lot to live up to.\nHENRY: (KISSES HER) And a lot to be thankful for.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 147\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 104: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: SETS COURSE.\nDOCTOR: Both sides understand this may not be easy.\nVILAL GENERAL: (VIA COMMS) It is what we want. If we are to survive.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Zerith?\nZERITH: (VIA COMMS) It may be possible to reach an agreement. To share the system. To appease the Time Lords.\nDOCTOR: Then I’1l see you back there to begin negotiations.\nDOCTOR: SWITCHES OFF COMMS.\nDOCTOR: This is your doing, Kinvar.\nKINVAR: No, Doctor — you stopped the fighting.\nDOCTOR: Only with Quicksilver’s help. The rest you must do because you want to. It only takes one person to stand up and refuse to fight, and you can start a revolution. A bloodless revolution.\nKINVAR: Thank you, Doctor. For everything.\nKINVAR: KNOCKING AT TARDIS DOOR.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. I should attend to this...\nDOCTOR: HURRIES OUT.\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 148\nQUICKSILVER: SCENE 105: EXT. VIENNA STREET, OUTSIDE TARDIS\nDOCTOR: EXITS TARDIS.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. You seemed in rather a hurry to depart. I believe we have unfinished business.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Constance, Flip. I’m sorry. Peacekeeping is quite distracting.\nFLIP: You weren’t seriously gonna go off and leave me in the wrong century?\nCONSTANCE: Quite irresponsible. It is this young lady’s wedding day, after all. I believe I may have missed a few years myself.\nDOCTOR: This treaty must take priority. The earliest stages are most delicate.\nFLIP: Sounds to me like you’1ll need some help. I’ma ‘very level- headed young woman’ after all!\nCONSTANCE: Whatever the particulars, we can certainly bring our experience to bear.\nDOCTOR: Well. On the understanding that once everything is happily concluded, I return you both to your own lives?\nFLIP: Right where we left off.\nCONSTANCE: As previously agreed.\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) I don’t stand a chance against the two of you, do I? (ENTERING TARDIS) Come along, then, ladies!\nFLIP: (LAUGHS) You and me, Connie. I reckon we’ve got him on the ropes.\nCONSTANCE: Quite. And kindly address me as... (BREAKS OFF)\nQUICKSILVER: by Matt Fitton (003—AB edits) Page 149\nFLIP: What?\nCONSTANCE: Never mind. ‘Connie’ will do just fine. (ENTERING TARDIS WITH FLIP) Philippa, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship...\nTARDIS: CLOSES AND DEMATERIALISES...\nTARDIS: THE END"
