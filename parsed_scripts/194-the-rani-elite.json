As Vice Chancellor of this establishment, I think I can say that without fear of contradiction. So which of you actually wishes to study for their doctorate?\nDOCTOR: What?\nVICE: CHANCELLOR\nVICE: And in what discipline, may I ask? We offer doctorates in most subjects — Logistical Astronomy, Galactic Civilisation, Quantum Nucleonics, Hip-Hop-Hap Theory...\nDOCTOR: I already have a doctorate. Several, in fact. Some in disciplines that haven’t even been invented yet... Look, Vice Chancellor, let me see if I can explain.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Please do. You’re already a doctor, you say?\nDOCTOR: Not just a doctor.\nPERI: This is THE Doctor. You invited him here.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR I did? Oh — THE Doctor? Yes, yes, I did.\nPERI: To give him an honorary degree.\nDOCTOR: Which, of course, I shall be delighted to accept.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Ah. No.\nVICE: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 8\nPERI: No?\nVICE: CHANCELLOR No.\nDOCTOR: No?!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR This is where the confusion arises you see.\nDOCTOR: Not really.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR It’s tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: Is it?

Are you saying we are a day early?\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Precisely.\nDOCTOR: Well, I do like to be precise.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR There is a lot to see. As you’re here, you’re very welcome to avail yourself of any or all of our amenities.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Peri — let us avail ourselves.\nPERI: Thank you, Vice Chancellor. We’ll see you tomorrow.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 9\nVICE: CHANCELLOR I look forward to it. As, I’m sure, will Professor Baxton.\nDOCTOR: (IMPRESSED) Professor Baxton?

Her name is venerated among the cognoscenti.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR (WARY) You know the professor?\nDOCTOR: Well, we have met. But it was a long time ago, and I had a different face back then.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: Oh don’t apologise. We’1ll see you tomorrow.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Yes.

I think we can.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: There is something distinctly odd going on here.\nPERI: Just because they didn’t hang out the bunting and hire the brass band a day early.\nDOCTOR: I said my timing was precise, Peri, and I meant it. Precisely one day early. Precisely because something is odd.\nPERI: You mean, you planned for us to arrive early?\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nPERI: But why?\nDOCTOR: That, my dear Peri, is the question. Ah — perhaps that will help.\nPERI: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Information access booth. A bit like tourist information. Only helpful.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: Incredible — this booth is actually smaller on the inside. Right, let’s see...\nPERI: You getting anywhere with that?\nDOCTOR: I most certainly am. All candidates for honorary degrees are nominated through a complicated voting system involving the academic staff and ratified by the governing board. All candidates in the history of the university, except one.\nPERI: Guess who.\nDOCTOR: My nomination was pushed through by the Vice Chancellor as a fait accompli.\nPERI: But, isn’t that a good thing?\nDOCTOR: Somehow I don’t think so. There is a reason why I was invited here. And it wasn’t to get a degree.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 12\nPERI: Whatever they want, it’s something to do with you.\nDOCTOR: Obviously.\nPERI: No, I mean — it’s not like they need someone clever.\nDOCTOR: What exactly are you implying, Miss Brown?\nPERI: This is a prestigious space university. They have clever people already.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I do see what you mean.\nPERI: So it’s you they want. The Doctor, in person.\nDOCTOR: Accept no substitutes... But how do we discover the truth? I mean clues aren’t just going to wander up to us and ask for [help]\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS HE SPEAKS, LIZZO RUNS UP — AGITATED, OUT OF BREATH,\nFRIGHTENED: FOR HER LIFE.)\nLIZZO: Help me — please, help me! They’re after me. Please, I don’t know who’s involved but you’re outsiders, So...\nPERI: Is it that obvious?\nLIZZO: So perhaps I can trust you.\nDOCTOR: You most certainly can trust us. You’re a Garnantian, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 13\nLIZZO: Yes, but [I need your help]\nDOCTOR: Thought I recognised the species. Cold-blooded, green scaly skin, the segmented tail...\nPERI: Doctor — she needs help! She’s terrified — look at her.\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course. Well, if we can help, we will. This is Peri, and I’m the Doctor — perhaps you’ve heard of me? No? Getting an honorary degree tomorrow? Still no? You’d better tell us all about it, um — what’s your name?\nLIZZO: Lizzo. Please — my head hurts...\nDOCTOR: Let me see.. Who did this to you? These cuts, and these burns — these are exactly the marks a Sidelian Brain Scanner would leave.\nLIZZO: I don’t know what it was. I don’t know what they want from me.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s easily answered. They want to steal your brain.\nFADE OUT: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 14\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN.

Like the Vice Chancellor.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know who to trust any more than Lizzo does. The Vice Chancellor could up to his academic eyebrows in whatever is going on. He’s the one who invited me here, remember?\nPERI: I suppose.\nDOCTOR: And I want to get a look at the Sidelian equipment. In purely chronological terms, it shouldn’t have been invented yet. Now, Lizzo, where in this Facility did you escape from exactly?\nLIZZO: Somewhere on the lower levels. An operating room. They gave me a sedative. I don’t think it was enough.\nPERI: You felt it?\nLIZZO: I escaped.\nDOCTOR: And you’ve no idea why this student, what did you say his name was? Reev? You’ve no idea why he would have done this to you?\nLIZZO: No. He always seemed very friendly. Clever, but quiet.\nLIZZO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 15\nPERI: They’re the worst. And the noisy ones, they’re the worst too.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see if we can find this operating room, then. You up to that, Lizzo?\nLIZZO: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Good girl.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORE DOORS AS THEY GO INSIDE THE FACILITY. FADE THEM AS THEY\nGO: )\nPERI: There’s an elevator down here.\nDOCTOR: She means a ‘lift’, Lizzo.

It feels like it is on fire.\nDOCTOR: Disadvantage of a cold-blooded species...\nPERI: Would it help if we bathed your head with cold water?\nLIZZO: It might.\nDOCTOR: Good idea, Peri. We could try that lab.. Aha — or this store room. Might find something useful in here.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR: Mind you don’t trip on the hermetic seal. —\nPERI: An airtight storeroom? Why?\nLIZZO: Chemicals stored here. See, on the shelves?\nDOCTOR: Good point. — That large cupboard is interesting.\nPERI: It’s locked.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it would be. But here’s a basin.. Pop the plug in, and... Hmmm, tap’s a bit stiff. Ah!\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Peri, you must be able to find a hanky in a pocket somewhere.\nPERI: Here you are.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I did actually mean in one of your own pockets rather than mine. But I suppose we all have to make sacrifices.\nLIZZO: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That better?\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 19\nLIZZO: It helps.\nPERI: (LOUD WHISPER) Someone’s coming.\nLIZZO: (PANIC) They will find me. They want my brain!\nPERI: (CALLING) No — Lizzo, wait!\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Stupid tap. They need a plumber not a Doctor.\nPERI: (URGENT) Doctor — Lizzo’s gone.

What are you doing down here? This is a restricted area.\nDOCTOR: That’s all right. We’re just looking.\nPERI: Just leaving too. Back to the elevat- the lift?\nFADE OUT: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 21\nPERI: ‘The Mira Vandweezi Library’. Why should Lizzo be hiding here?\nDOCTOR: I very much doubt she is.\nPERI: Then what are we doing here?\nDOCTOR: She could be hiding anywhere, and we can hardly search the whole campus. No, the best way to help Lizzo now is to find out what’s really going on.\nPERI: You’re worried about this Sidelian brain thing?\nDOCTOR: I am. And I don’t want to ruffle too many questions or raise too many feathers before we know a bit more about what we’re dealing with.\nPERI: Hence the university library.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Don’t worry — we’ll find Lizzo.\nPERI: How? There are no books. How can you have a library with no books?\nDOCTOR: The books are all digitised. Data and information rather than paper and print. But for what it’s worth, I agree with you. There’s nothing like the smell of a real library — leather binding, yellowing paper, the knowledge of the centuries scratched out on parchment by men of learning...\nPERI: So where do we start?\nDOCTOR: University Information System. Here we are.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 22\nPERI: Are these all the students?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. A mini-biog for each. The students are supposed to keep them up to date, and when they leave it forms a record of their time here.\nPERI: Is Lizzo in there?\nDOCTOR: Just what I was... Ah yes — here we are. Let’s play the latest entry.\nLIZZO: (PLAYBACK) So, my final year. [I can’t believe it. This time next year I’1ll be — well, I don’t know where I’1l1 be. I wonder what Raych and Chanksy and the others will be doing. I’1l miss them — we’ve had some laughs...]\nPERI: She seems so happy.\nDOCTOR: Yes, she does. Her whole life ahead of her.\nPERI: I hope she’s all right.\nDOCTOR: We’ll make sure she is.\nLIZZO: (PLAYBACK) ..I’ve got to pass the exams first of course. Though Professor Baxton has predicted me a Highest on her learning stream, which is amazing...\nLIZZO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: That was just a few days ago.\nPERI: I can’t believe it’s the same person. What happened to her?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know... Ah, this is interesting, look — Lizzo’s seminar group, complete with pictures.\nPERI: Hey, isn’t that —\nDOCTOR: The rude young man who pushed past us when we arrived, yes. Miklev, apparently. Studying First-Phase Geo-Tolerance and Moral Philosophy.\nPERI: Maybe we can find him. He might know what’s going on.\nDOCTOR: My thoughts exactly. At least we know he’s not hiding. Here, take this.\nPERI: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Datacube. I’ve copied Lizzo’s whole journal on to it. Could be useful.\nPERI: I always meant to keep a journal when I was a student. Never got round to it.\nDOCTOR: Well there’s plenty of room on the cube if you want to start now. Press your thumb against that red side, and hold it like... so. There. When you’re done just release the pressure, and voila.\nPERI: Student recording.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: Now let’s see if we can track down this Miklev. Why don’t you have a look outside? This library seems to be at a major junction of all the footpaths — you never know, he might wander past.\nPERI: Like before. What about you?\nDOCTOR: I’ll see if I can call up his timetable on this terminal. I shan’t be long...\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) I hope...\nPERI: Yeah, right. I’1ll see you soon.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know I’m not authorised, you stupid machine... That’s why I’m bypassing the security systems...\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D)\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Typical. Just typical. (CALLING) Sorry, everyone. Sorry — I think I pressed the wrong button. Nothing nefarious, nothing suspicious... Um, could someone...?\nMIKLEV: There you are. That should be fine now. If I can do anything else to help — (just say)\nDOCTOR: Indeed you can. — Miklev, isn’t it?\nMIKLEV: That’s right. Hey, didn’t I see you earlier? When I was late for the Quantum Redaction seminar?\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: You certainly did.

Guess I’d be a mature student now. — But travelling with the Doctor is certainly an education. It’s like doing social service too, I guess. We help people. There are a lot of people who need helping. For all his brashness and posturing, the Doctor always stands up for what’s right. Truth, justice, and the Gallifreyan way. He doesn’t seem to care that one day it might get him killed. Actually, I’ve seen him die. He died for me. He thought I was worth saving. I sometimes wonder if one day, I’1l end up returning the favour. This is crazy, it’s like I’m writing my own obituary. Oh — here he comes now. Cue danger and excitement.\nDOCTOR: Peri — meet Miklev.\nPERI: Hi there.\nMIKLEV: Um, hello.\nDOCTOR: Miklev was telling me he knows our mutual friend Lizzo.\nPERI: Really?\nMIKLEV: Well, we’re in the same lecture group. I see her around.\nPERI: When did you last see her?\nMIKLEV: This morning, like I told the Doctor. She seemed fine. I don’t know why you’re worried about her.\nDOCTOR: She just seemed a little ‘down’ when we saw her.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 27\nMIKLEV: She was OK at the seminar. It’s funny, Reev was looking for her just now as well.\nPERI: Reev? But that’s — (the student who attacked Lizzo)\nDOCTOR: Yes, Peri.. And you haven’t seen Lizzo since then.\nMIKLEV: Actually, yes. Talking of Reev reminds me — she had to go and do an extra test, I think.\nPERI: What’s that got to do with Reev?\nMIKLEV: Just that he took the test a while back. A few of the students have done it recently.\nDOCTOR: Have you taken this extra test?\nMIKLEV: No, not me. It’s the brainy ones who get selected.\nDOCTOR: And then they return to their normal curriculum afterwards?\nMIKLEV: Yes, why wouldn’t they?\nDOCTOR: No reason. No reason at all.\nMIKLEV: Though... Well, don’t tell anyone I said so, but with some of them... Like Reev...\nPERI: What?\nMIKLEV: It does go to their heads a bit.\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: Their heads?\nMIKLEV: Well, they hang out together, ignore the rest of us — even people who used to be friends. I got on all right with Reev, but since he took the test he just blanks me.\nPERI: Sounds like this test isn’t a good thing.\nMIKLEV: A couple of the quieter ones, who wouldn’t say boo to a gastropod, have really come out of themselves. Maybe that’s a good thing?\nDOCTOR: A personality change?\nMIKLEV: I’ll say. Shy and retiring one day, partying like there’s no tomorrow the next. Look, sorry — I have to go, I’ve got a lecture with Professor Baxton over in H7. If Lizzo’s there, I’1l tell her you’re looking for her. Catch you later, yeah?\nPERI: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: (MIMICKING) Yeah.\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Come on then, Peri.\nPERI: Where to?\nDOCTOR: H7 of course.

If your contention is that we’re not responsible for our own actions, or even thoughts, aren’t you rather ducking the issue of morality?\nBAXTON: Am I?\nDOCTOR: I believe so. If nothing else, I’d have thought an academic of your reputation and calibre would have an opinion on the whole question of whether the end justifies the means, rather than ascribing it all to the ebb and flow of the universe. Perhaps you could tell us exactly where you stand on the issue? Hmm?\nBAXTON: Or perhaps I think my opinions are my own business, and each and every student should be allowed to make up their own minds.

Another of my mature students, are you?\nPERI: (SLIGHTLY MIFFED) Er, no. — But I was at your lecture.\nBAXTON: Oh yes. With the rather forthright gentleman.\nPERI: I had a few questions. About the lecture...\nBAXTON: You'll have to wait until next time, I’m afraid. Life’s too short for one thing, and for another I have an appointment at the Medical Facility. So if you’1ll excuse me.\nPERI: But why would you be going...

Run out of things to do already?\nDOCTOR: I have more than enough to do, thank you. And the most important thing I have to do is warn you.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Warn me? About what?\nDOCTOR: Professor Baxton.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Professor Baxton? Doctor, you said yourself that Professor Baxton is one of the most respected and [notable academics... ]\nDOCTOR: That was before I met her.

What’s this equipment?\nLIZZO: How — how did you find me?\nPERI: I was following Professor Baxton, but I got lost. It was like someone moved the walls round.\nLIZZO: Baxton?\nPERI: Yes, let me help you. Who did this to you?\nLIZZO: Professor Baxton.\nPERI: Yes, I said.\nBAXTON: (OFF) I think she was answering your question.\nPERI: (GASPS) Professor Baxton!\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 37\nPERI: 21. ™%§INT.

And the Professor Baxton you have lecturing here is not the Professor Baxton I remember.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR As we get older, the memory sometimes cheats...\nDOCTOR: Not my memory. I don’t know how she’s done it. Falsified files, rectified records, changed every reference to and picture of the real Professor in all the databases in the galaxy, but I can assure you that the woman who calls herself Professor Baxton is nothing of the sort.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Then...

Not exactly the Doctor I was expecting, but one can’t have everything.\nPERI: Who are you?\nRANI: You really don’t recognise me? You must know that Time Lords can regenerate.\nPERI: A Time Lord?!

I’m not the amoral sociopath passing myself off as a noted academic.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR With respect, I only have your word for that. If we access the central galactic registry...\nVICE: (FX: BLEEPS FROM THE TERMINAL AS VICE CHANCELLOR PULLS UP INFORMATION. )\nVICE: CHANCELLOR . You can see for yourself.

I don’t know what she’s up to but it must be something to do with... Here, let me...\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Be my guest. What are you looking for, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, these must be the tests I was told about.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR I can assure you everything is in order. The last Optimex Inspection gave us a triple-A rating.\nDOCTOR: Really? That is impressive. And they inspected this Gifted and Talented programme of yours, did they?\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Of course. If you’ve seen enough..?\nDOCTOR: What? Oh yes, thank you. Now, what are you going to do about the Rani? — I mean ‘Professor Baxton’?\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 41\nVICE: CHANCELLOR\nVICE: I really don’t see what I can do. Unless you can give me some proof that Professor Baxton is an imposter, I have no reason to do anything.\nDOCTOR: You mean my word is not enough?!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR That is exactly what I mean.\nDOCTOR: Then I shall get you proof.

But if you’re at the laser-dance tonight [maybe I’1l see you there]\nDOCTOR: Laser-dance? Do I look like I laser-dance?\nREEV: You look like you might do anything in that outfit.\nREEV: LIZZO-ALIEN So, what do you lecture in? Fashion?\nMIKLEV: That’s a bit rude, Lizzo.

Anyway, I’m fine now.\nDOCTOR: So I see.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN And thanks for all your help. But it’s all sorted out now.

Yes, she was here earlier.\nDOCTOR: But not now?\nBAXTON: She’s not far away.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m flattered, not to say surprised, that you recognise me, Professor Baxton. Last time we met, I had a different face. But then — so did you. Whatever mischief you’re up to, Rani, I shall put a stop to it.\nRANI: You always assume the worst, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: In your case, with good reason. — Why have you brought me here? I assume it was you who engineered those particular shenanigans.\nRANI: Please, Doctor. Here I am Professor Baxton, a respectable and respected academic.\nDOCTOR: Falsifying a few records and swapping a few pictures doesn’t make you a different person. What I don’t understand is why bothered to try to imitate the real Professor’s voice?\nRANI: Pictures are easily replaced. Even video images. But the University archives sound recordings of all lectures.\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR: And audio data takes a lot longer to fake. I see. So what has happened to the real Baxton, hmmm?\nRANI: She's... indisposed.\nDOCTOR: There, Reev — you heard her, she admits it! She admits she is not Professor Baxton! Although I will concede that she is a brilliant scientist in her own right...\nRANI: How kind.\nDOCTOR: She is in fact a decidedly amoral renegade Time Lord exiled from the planet Gallifrey who doesn’t give two hoots about anyone except herself and her mad schemes for galactic domination.\nREEV: I know.\nDOCTOR: Whatever she’s told you is — What do you mean, you know?\nREEV: She’s the Rani.\nDOCTOR: You know?! —\nREEV: Hands up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh look, a gun.

He and I are old friends, you know.\nRANI: (FOLLOWING) Oh do be quiet.\nPERI: (SURPRISED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Peri — are you all right?\nPERI: Oh yeah. Just happy to be reunited with our old friend with the new face and locked up in this pokey little office.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it does appear to be suffering from a dearth of interior design features. I do think you might have gone to a bit more trouble when you selected somewhere to incarcerate us, Rani. I mean, one desk and a novelty glass paperweight.\nRANI: Well, if you will turn up a whole day early for your award. A whole incarnation early, come to that. I was expecting the little chap with the hat and umbrella and the [whiny friend Melanie. ]\nDOCTOR: (HANDS OVER EARS) La, la, la! — I have no idea what you’re talking about.\nRANI: Obviously. So what were you doing, hoping to organise some pre- publicity? Cheerleaders and a brass band, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: No. Not brass, anyway. And it’s a good job I did turn up early.\nPERI: In time to thwart your plans.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 51\nRANI: ‘Thwart my plans’? You must be a devotee of the cheapest forms of melodrama.\nDOCTOR: Forgive her, she’s American.\nRANI: I’d never have guessed. Fortunately my plans are running ahead of schedule, and are well past the ‘thwartable’ stage. So your arriving early is a positive advantage.\nDOCTOR: Why not take a seat and tell us all about it.\nRANI: Three reasons. The first being that I have no intention of telling you anything that might later inconvenience me.\nPERI: Spoilsport.\nRANI: The second being that I’m rather busy. So I shall be back for the two of you later. You, Doctor, are very important to my unthwartable plans.\nDOCTOR: Whatever they are.\nRANI: Don’t you just love surprises?\nPERI: I hate surprises.\nRANI: It’s not your surprise.\nDOCTOR: Well, that wasn’t very enlightening. She didn’t even tell us the\nDOCTOR: third reason why she wouldn’t take a seat and explain.\nPERI: That’s easy. There aren’t any chairs.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 52\nTUTOR: I’m sorry there weren’t enough chairs. I’1ll sort that out for the next seminar.\nTUTOR: (CONT'D)\nTUTOR: So if you can all read section 9, please. Oh, and I have a message that several of you are to report for an extra test in E- 14 straightaway. Miklev?\nMIKLEV: Yes, sir?\nTUTOR: You’re one of them. And Gantrik, Feldman and Carlotta. Thank you.\nMIKLEV: Sorry, what test is this? What’s it for?\nTUTOR: I really don’t know. But I’m sure they’11l tell you all about it in E-14.\nTUTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 53\nPERI: Why is the Rani so interested in you?\nDOCTOR: I’m a very interesting person.\nPERI: It’s obviously because of her that we’re here.\nDOCTOR: But why is she here? And why does she need to steal Professor Baxton’s identity?\nPERI: Well, we’re not going to find out while we’re locked up.\nDOCTOR: True enough. So I suggest we vacate this less than salubrious accommodation forthwith.\nPERI: And how do we do that? The door’s locked. No other doors, no windows, not even a ventilation grille. It’s all solid metal.\nDOCTOR: Yes... Yes!\nPERI: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) (AS HE KNOCKS) Interesting. Yes.\nPERI: Metal.\nDOCTOR: Not just any metal. This room — this whole building — it’s Magna- struct.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 54\nPERI: Yeah, the Rani said.\nDOCTOR: Magna-struct is often used for offices and academic institutes, health facilities — any building where you might want to shift round the topography. Change the positions of the internal walls and doors; ceilings and floors too, sometimes.\nPERI: So these walls are all held in place by... what, magnetism?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s not quite as simple as that. But in principle, yes. If you want to move a wall, you just de-polarise the plate, shift it where you want, and then re-polarise. Locking it solid.\nPERI: Like a kid’s construction toy. Only bigger... The Rani shifted the walls to send me where she wanted. Hey — Doctor! Maybe we could depolarise one of these walls and make it into a new door!\nDOCTOR: A brilliant idea, Peri!\nPERI: Thanks, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And one which I had about five minutes ago.\nPERI: Oh.\nDOCTOR: But we’d need something thin and non-magnetic, but rigid enough to force under the wall at a polarisation point to break the field.\nPERI: Like a plastic comb?\nDOCTOR: Ideal. Do you have one?\nPERI: No.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nPERI: I was just saying. As an example... This paperweight’s no good. But maybe there’s something in the desk drawers?\nDOCTOR: We can but look. And...\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) . Nothing.\nPERI: (FX: CLACKING SCISSORS) There’s a pair of scissors.\nDOCTOR: Metal. Magnetic.\nPERI: So what now?\nDOCTOR: There must be something we can use. Think!\nPERI: Wait a minute — cloth!\nDOCTOR: Cloth?\nPERI: Material. Wool, cotton, linen...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know what cloth is, Peri. It’s what I sometimes think your ears are made from, actually.\nPERI: But would cloth break the polarisation thing, under the wall?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it would... Except, we need something rigid, that we can force between the magnetised plates.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 56\nPERI: We wrap it round the scissors.\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFUL) It would have to be fairly thick, so the magnetic field didn’t just work through the material. (THINKING) I gave my hanky to Lizzo to bathe her head...\nPERI: I was thinking of cutting a bit off your coat.\nDOCTOR: Absolutely not. This coat is unique.\nPERI: I certainly hope so.\nDOCTOR: I am not cutting bits off it. We’ll take a bit off your skirt instead.\nPERI: No you won’t. Doctor — your coat’s thicker, and you won’t miss just a bit. Look, we can cut along the edges of the pattern, or take off a pocket or something.\nDOCTOR: A pocket? Take off a pocket? Where would I keep my hanky?\nPERI: You haven’t got a hanky, remember?\nDOCTOR: Even so. I’ve got a better idea. I'll take my coat off, and we can just wrap the sleeve round the scissors, like this... See? Then if we can force the scissors under this wall...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR RAMS THE SCISSORS UNDER THE WALL. A METALLIC CLICK, AND THE WALL COMES FREE OF THE FLOOR. )\nPERI: Is that it?\nDOCTOR: I think it is. Help me push this end of the wall...\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL)\nPERI: This room looks just the same.\nDOCTOR: But with one important difference, I hope...\nPERI: That the door’s unlocked?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: Page 57\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 58\nBAXTON: Thank you for taking the test, everyone. The system has evaluated and collated all the answers, and I’1ll make sure you get a corresponding credit on your overall course rating. There was one student whose rating was well above everyone else. Miklev, would you come with me, please. The rest of you can go.\nMIKLEV: Me? Really? I mean, are you sure?\nBAXTON: Oh yes, I’m sure. It’s not just to do with your academic achievement.\nMIKLEV: Then what?\nBAXTON: There are other factors that the system takes into account when\nBAXTON: assessing your suitability.\nMIKLEV: Suitability for what? I’m sorry, Professor, I don’t understand.\nBAXTON: You come with me, Miklev, and everything will become clear.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR: . One thing’s for certain, the Vice Chancellor knows more than he’s saying. Baxton’s been here for years, and so has he. So he must know she’s an imposter.\nPERI: You think he’s in cahoots with the Rani.\nDOCTOR: Cahoots? What sort of a word is — [‘cahoots’?]\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Someone coming! Quick — hide!\nPERI: Hide? Where?\nDOCTOR: Behind the reception desk.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THEY BUNDLE BEHIND THE DESK, JUST AS DOORS OPEN TO ADMIT MIKLEV AND ‘BAXTON’. )\nPERI: (WHISPERS) She’s got a gun!\nRANI: Through here.\nMIKLEV: Why here? I don’t need medical treatment.\nRANI: (BORED) Oh, really?\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 60\nRANI: (CONT’D) You do now.\nPERI: (SOTTO) Miklev!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No, Peri — it’s just a tranquiliser pistol. She still needs him for something.\nPERI: (SOTTO) She’s coming over!\nPERI: (FX: THE RANI CROSSES TO THE DESK, PRESSES A BUTTON. HER VOICE IS\nAMPLIFIED BY THE PA SYSTEM: )\nRANI: (INTO MIC) Students Anton and Reev to the main entrance please. You have a package to collect.\nPERI: (SOTTO) Doctor, there must be something we can do.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) There is. But not yet..

There are a few things I need to take care of, and then I’ll be back to supervise the transfer.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 63\nPERI: What are they doing to Miklev?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Peri. But it’s time they stopped.\nPERI: That’s Lizzo.. Look, the Rani’s leaving.\nDOCTOR: She might be heading this way. Keep an eye on the corridor.\nPERI: Right. What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t just the security feeds I found under the desk.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) If I can isolate the public address system the Rani used just now.. Yes — done it! I think.\nPERI: Done what?\nDOCTOR: Something immeasurably clever. I’ve connected the PA system to this remote microphone, and fixed it so it will only be heard in that operating room.\nPERI: And how does that help?\nDOCTOR: Bring the microphone, and let’s find the operating room.\nPERI: And then?\nDOCTOR: Watch and learn.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: (OVER PA) This is a message from Professor Baxton. Would all her special students report immediately to the laboratory on the lower level.\nLIZZO: Where do you think you’re going, Reev?\nDOCTOR: (OVER PA) I repeat, all Professor Baxton’s students to report immediately.\nREEV: You heard that.\nLIZZO: I don’t think it applies to us. She knows we’re busy.\nDOCTOR: (OVER PA) That includes students Lizzo, Anton, and Reev.\nLIZZO: (SIGHS) All right. I’1ll put the process on hold. We’d better see what she wants.\nLIZZO: (FX: BLEEPS ETC. THEN THEY LEAVE. DOOR CLOSES. BEAT.

Miklev — wake up!\nDOCTOR: I’1ll cut the suppressors and route a stimulant to his neural centres. — There, that should help.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 65\nMIKLEV: (GROANS AND WAKES, GROGGY) What? Where am I? What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Easy now.\nPERI: Oh Miklev, thank goodness.\nMIKLEV: Peri? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Come on, let’s get these probes detached and up you get.\nMIKLEV: Woah, my legs. I feel... The world’s spinning. Is it supposed to be doing that?\nPERI: You’1ll feel better soon. Won’t he, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I expect so. But we don’t have time to wait. Those students will be back any minute.\nPERI: And the Rani.\nMIKLEV: The which?\nDOCTOR: ‘Witch’ is not far wide of the mark. Come on, we’ll help you.\nPERI: Shouldn’t we stay and stop the Rani?\nDOCTOR: We will. Once we know what she’s up to.\nMIKLEV: Where are we going?\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: The Vice Chancellor’s office.\nPERI: You think he’1ll help us?\nDOCTOR: No. But I think his information and data systems might. With a bit of additional help from young Miklev here.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: (FX: HUM OF EQUIPMENT. THE RANI IS TALKING QUIETLY TO SOMEONE AS\nSHE: WORKS. )\nRANI: Are you quite comfortable in there? No, of course not. You’re not coping at all, are you? All those minds, pulling in different directions. Always squabbling. No focus... I have to say you’ve been rather a disappointment. But you can take comfort from the knowledge that very soon this will all be over for you... Although for the Doctor, I’m afraid it will just be beginning...\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: .And that’s all the students you can think of who have taken the test and then ‘changed’?\nMIKLEV: Plus Lizzo of course.\nDOCTOR: Yes, got her. Just cross-referencing the results.\nMIKLEV: And what will that tell you.\nDOCTOR: I’m looking for similarities. All still clear out there, Peri?\nPERI: (AT DOOR) Yeah. No sign of anyone. Maybe the VC’s with the Rani?\nDOCTOR: Quite likely. They’re definitely in cahoots.\nMIKLEV: In what? What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea. Ask Peri.\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Here we are...\nMIKLEV: What’s it say?\nDOCTOR: The students who you say seemed different after they took the test are all the brightest and best in a particular field.\nPERI: (COMING OVER) You mean she’s looking for a breadth of knowledge and expertise, rather than just the cleverest students.\nPERI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nMIKLEV: But why? What’s she doing to us, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.. Maybe if I check the Vice Chancellor’s personal log...\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Ah yes, look at this. Here — look, look.\nMIKLEV: It’s an order for electronic and medical components.\nPERI: So what?\nDOCTOR: So, it was placed by the Vice Chancellor. Exactly the parts you’d need to build a bio-digital interface controller!\nPERI: (LAUGHS) Doctor, us mortals have no idea what you’re on about.\nDOCTOR: Shouldn’t you be keeping watch?\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 70\nCUT TO: (FX: DING OF A LIFT ARRIVING.

I shall be glad when you move me into something younger... Miklev? Yes, I know him. He’1ll be ideal.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 71\nPERI: He’s coming!\nDOCTOR: Nowhere to hide. We’ll bluff it. Stay calm everyone.\nMIKLEV: Calm?!\nMIKLEV: (FX: VICE CHANCELLOR ENTERS. HE’S BREATHING HEAVILY — ALMOST WHEEZING. )\nVICE: CHANCELLOR What? You again, Doctor. And.. Miklev, isn’t it? You’re looking very well. Very young and energetic.\nMIKLEV: (A BIT CREEPED OUT BY THIS) What?\nDOCTOR: Never mind the pleasantries. We rather wanted a little chat.\nMIKLEV: (ANGRY) I want more than a chat! What have you been doing, old man?\nPERI: Miklev — no!\nDOCTOR: This won’t help.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Get off me!\nMIKLEV: Not until you tell me what you’re doing! What’s happened to Lizzo and the others?\nVICE: CHANCELLOR (EFFORT) I said — get — off — me!\nVICE: (FX: THE VICE CHANCELLOR PUSHES MIKLEV AWAY. MIKLEV STUMBLES AND FALLS, HITTING HIS HEAD. )\nVICE: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 72\nPERI: (RUSHING OVER) Miklev!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR (EFFORT, BUT CONCERNED) Is he — is he all right? His body’s not damaged?\nPERI: Damaged?! What do you care? He hit his head on the desk. He’s out cold.\nVICE CHANCELLOR: (BREATHING BECOMES MORE LABOURED AND WHEEZY — HE IS AGEING RAPIDLY! )\nDOCTOR: He'll be all right. Which is more than I can say for the Vice Chancellor.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Help me — please.\nPERI: But he’s... ancient!\nDOCTOR: Aged about fifty years in just a few seconds.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR I need... need the auto-injector...\nPERI: Where’s he going?\nDOCTOR: Not far by the look of him. But we should follow, just as soon as.. Yes, Miklev will be fine. He’s coming round.\nMIKLEV: (GROANS) Oh, my head...\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 73\nPERI: We'll be back in a minute. You’1ll be all right.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Peri.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 74\nCUT TO: (FX: THUNK-HISS OF AN AUTO-INJECTOR. THE VICE CHANCELLOR’S\nBREATHING: RECOVERS. )\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Thank you. Thank you, that’s better.\nRANI: It’s a good job you called me.\nDOCTOR: Uh-oh.\nPERI: The Rani!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Oh yes, I knew there was something. I found these two trespassing in my office.\nPERI: He’s back to normal.\nDOCTOR: I doubt that. But he certainly seems more sprightly, all of a sudden.\nRANI: Haven’t you caused enough trouble for one day, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ve barely started.\nRANI: Really.\nDOCTOR: I’m beginning to understand what you’re up to, Rani, and I shan’t rest until I stop you.\nRANI: Then you’re going to get very tired. Vice Chancellor?\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 75\nPERI: Doctor, he’s got a gun!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Peri. The Rani needs us for her nefarious scheme,\nDOCTOR: remember. She can’t afford to kill us.\nRANI: If it’s that or listen to you pontificate, Doctor, then I think I’1ll cope. Vice Chancellor.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Yes?\nRANI: Shoot them.\nDOCTOR: What?\nPERI: No!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR My pleasure.\nDOCTOR: & PERI\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 76"

You’re going to be fine.\nPERI: Yes, but when?\nDOCTOR: If Peri is harmed I — [shall take serious action]\nRANI: Oh be quiet. You’re not in a position to do anything, Doctor. Annoy me, and the Vice Chancellor will shoot you both again.

Or a variation of it.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 79\nVICE: CHANCELLOR How could he know that?\nDOCTOR: Oh you’d be surprised what I know.\nPERI: (GROGGY) What is Siberian memory transfer?\nRANI: It’s a method for moving experiential information from one organic cerebellum to another.\nPERI: Thanks. Big help.\nDOCTOR: Except you’re not just adding memories to a conscious mind, are you? You’re wiping the brain clean and then installing a whole new personality.\nRANI: I’m doing far more than that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: New bodies for old minds, is that it?

So soon?\nDOCTOR: Make that thirty years. Or, no, closer to forty now, I’d say.

(FADING) Let him speak...\nVICE: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR: Just can’t get the staff, can you? Especially when the staff you do have are suffering from temporo-chronic rejection.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR What is that?\nDOCTOR: I imagine the mind she’s implanted in that body was very old. Very old indeed.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR What of it? The body is young. And soon I’1l have an even younger one.\nDOCTOR: You mean Peri? Is that what’s she’s promised you — put up with the well-worn body of the poor old V-C and you can upgrade to something younger and stronger later? It will never happen.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Her body will serve me wel11..\nRANI: Fit for purpose, I suppose. The bodyscan I took earlier showed up traces of Trimorphol poisoning, but that needn’t bother you.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Trimorphol? What does that mean?\nRANI: The Doctor knows. — I wonder, does Ms Brown?\nDOCTOR: (HASTILY) That’s not important now.\nRANI: So she doesn’t? How remiss of you.\nDOCTOR: All this is irrelevant! The point is, Vice Chancellor — you can never make the transfer now.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR What do you mean?\nVICE: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 86\nRANI: (LOSING PATIENCE) Haven’t you worked it out yet?\nDOCTOR: Your mind is supposed to adapt to its new, younger body. But she got it wrong. So instead, the body is adapting to your mind — getting older to try to match.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Why is it happening so often? I need another dose from the auto- injector.\nDOCTOR: Tell him.\nRANI: Give me the gun, Vice Chancellor. I can load it with a dose of the anti-toxin instead of the tranquiliser. I have a cartridge here.\nDOCTOR: No, don’t-!\nRANI: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Tell him!\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Tell me what?\nRANI: You fool. There is no anti-toxin. No cure.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR What?\nDOCTOR: She lied to you. All she can do is suppress the effects, delay the inevitable.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR No — no, she promised us. Rani, you promised me!\nVICE: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But sooner or later, you will die.\nRANI: Oh sooner, Doctor. Definitely sooner.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR\nDOCTOR: Not a cartridge of anti-toxin, then. Another lie.\nRANI: The humane solution. I thought you’d approve.\nDOCTOR: Humane? Humane?! How is shooting a man dead humane?\nRANI: He was dying anyway. You said so yourself. I just spared him the additional suffering.\nDOCTOR: Suffering that you instigated.\nRANI: Well nobody’s perfect. — Now, drag his body into that store cupboard.\nDOCTOR: And if I refuse?\nRANI: Then there is still more than enough Spielsnape toxin in this cartridge to kill you too.\nDOCTOR: But you need me alive, remember?\nRANI: Just put the body in the cupboard.\nRANI: (FX: THE DOCTOR GIVES A GRUNT OF ANNOYANCE, BUT OPENS THE CUPBOARD, DRAGS THE BODY INSIDE, AND CLOSES IT.)\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: Happy now, are we?\nRANI: Deliriously.\nCUT TO: Page 88\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 89\nMIKLEV: (TO HIMSELF) Think, Miklev, think.

It’s automated from now on.\nDOCTOR: For the last time, Rani — you have to stop this. Can’t you see it doesn’t work? Your scheme, whatever it really is, is founded on a false premise.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN What’s he talking about?\nRANI: As always, he doesn’t know. But you’1ll be pleased to learn, Doctor, that I don’t need to operate on you.\nDOCTOR: Scant relief, if I may say so, while Peri is in danger.\nRANI: You'd do better to worry about yourself. I may not need to operate — but I do still have an important task for you to perform.\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR: I don’t doubt it. But if you think I’11l do what you want willingly, you’re going to be very disappointed.\nRANI: Somehow, I think I’1l cope.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 92\nCUT TO: (NB: FROM NOW ON, PERI IS POSSESSED BY ONE OF THE ALIENS — THOUGH\nSHE: PRETENDS SHE IS STILL PERI WITH THE DOCTOR AND MIKLEV. )\nKLAXONS: SOUND — CONTINUOUSLY FROM HERE. )\nKLAXONS: PERI-ALIEN (GROGGY) What’s happening?\nREEV: Power failure.

She’s a piece of work. We rescue the Doctor and then we can sort her out.\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN\nMIKLEV: (UNFAMILIAR EXPRESSION) Sort her out? Yes. But maybe we should just get out of here. I mean, make sure we’re safe first then think it through.\nMIKLEV: No, no — we can find the Doctor while the power’s off and everyone’s running round like headless teklamarians.\nMIKLEV: (CONT'D) Hear that-?

That would explain the power cut.\nRANI: No, this is some fool enterprise you’ve organised.\nDOCTOR: While stuck in here with you?\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN At least the alarms have stopped. What do you think triggered them?\nRANI: There’s only one way to find out. I need to get full power back on. Take this.\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN You want me to shoot him?\nDOCTOR: Not very hospitable.\nRANI: Keep an eye on him. But if he tries anything, then yes I want you to shoot him.\nDOCTOR: You don’t like the idea of killing, do you, Lizzo?\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN Be quiet.\nDOCTOR: Or whatever your real name is. Because that’s only Lizzo’s body you’re in, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN (UNSETTLED) I said be quiet.\nDOCTOR: The thing is, you killed the real Lizzo. That body doesn’t come for free, you know. Everything has a price. Only it isn’t you that paid that price. — The Vice Chancellor did, mind you, when he aged to death.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN Aged to... What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: Oh, so you don’t want me to be quiet any more?\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN Just tell me, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Of course. Though the Rani will kill me if she comes back and finds — (HE BREAKS OFF, APPARENTLY SEEING THE RANI.) Too late —\nDOCTOR: here she is now.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN (TURNING) Rani? I was just — (DOCTOR CHARGES HER AS SHE LOOKS ROUND AT NOTHING) Ooof!\nDOCTOR: Uh, uh, uh! I’1ll take that. — Like the Vice Chancellor, you’re older than you look, I’m guessing. But still you fell for the oldest trick in the book.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN Are you going to shoot me?\nDOCTOR: Shoot you? What do you take me for? I don’t go around shooting people. No, there’s been enough unpleasantness here already. Nasty, dangerous things, guns. So I think I’1l look after this one.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Ah, the power’s back on.

What kept you?\nMIKLEV: Doctor!\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN What are you doing hiding behind the reception desk?\nDOCTOR: You remember the access panel to those cables?\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Er, yes?\nDOCTOR: (FX: A DISCORDANT BLEEP AS MIKLEV TRIES TO OPEN THE DOORS, BUT THEY REMAIN SEALED. )\nMIKLEV: We’re too late.\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN The doors won’t open?\nMIKLEV: The Rani’s sealed the facility.\nDOCTOR: Indeed she has.

That shouldn’t have happened.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) But never mind.\nMIKLEV: The doors are open!\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN Come on then.\nDOCTOR: Not that way.\nMIKLEV: But you just opened the doors.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.

While they’re looking for us out there, I want to take a look at that laboratory on the lower level.\nMIKLEV: You think it’s important?\nDOCTOR: Important? I think it’s key.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Come on then.\nFADE TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 100\nCROSS TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 101\nCROSS TO: (FX: ALL JOGGING TO HALT. VERY FAINT SOUND OF WATER FROM OFF —\nBARELY: PERCEPTIBLE )\nDOCTOR: Yes, this is the place. I remember that storeroom just there where we bathed Lizzo’s head.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Can you hear something? Like running [water?]\nDOCTOR: (FX: DROWNED OUT WHEN DOCTOR TRIES TO ACTIVATE DOOR. A ‘NEGATIVE’ BUZZ)\nDOCTOR: The door’s security-shielded!\nMIKLEV: You mean we’re locked out?\nDOCTOR: Looks that way. It was open earlier, so with any luck the fact it’s shut means we can have the place to ourselves.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN We have to get inside first.\nMIKLEV: Any ideas, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hundreds. Thousands. Millions of ideas, all the time.\nMIKLEV: I meant for getting the door open.\nDOCTOR: Oh I’m sure I’1l have something in my pockets...\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN (FLAT) Really.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see now...\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D)\nDOCTOR: Hold these.\nMIKLEV: What are these?\nDOCTOR: Jelly babies. Sweets. Gone a bit hard, probably.\nMIKLEV: Sweets?\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) No — wait — stop!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Don’t eat that.\nMIKLEV: Why not?\nDOCTOR: It’s my favourite colour. Orange, mmmn.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) You can have the green ones.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORE POCKET RUMMAGING. THE DOCTOR FINDS THE GUN HE TOOK FROM LIZZO.)\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Here, Peri, you’d better have this.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN A gun?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, it’s not mine. I had to relieve someone else of it a little while ago. Aha!\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Success?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nMIKLEV: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Well it goes ‘bleep’ which is always a good start.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN But will it open the door?\nDOCTOR: Oh ye of little faith. Wait, watch, and learn.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORE BLEEPING, FOLLOWED BY THE ‘CLUNK’ OF THE DOOR UNLOCKING. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) There you are.\nMIKLEV: Well done, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now then — after me.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 104\nRANI: Where’s Ms Brown?\nREEV: But — she was here. The operation was... I went to check on the power systems. Someone must have undone the straps.\nRANI: Worked that out all by yourself, did you? — We’d better check the laboratory. Make sure someone isn’t poking their nose in where it’s not wanted. Come on!\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 105\nCUT TO: (FX: HI-TECH EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING WHAT SOUNDS LIKE LIFE-SUPPORT MACHINES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM, BEHIND A SCREEN. )\nCUT TO: PERI-ALIEN (ENTERING) The Rani’s lab?\nDOCTOR: So it would seem.\nMIKLEV: She’s got some serious technology in here. What’s it all for?\nDOCTOR: (FX: CROSSING TO COMPUTER BANK) Nothing good, that’s certain. Just don’t touch anything.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN (FX: FOLLOWING HIM) You know what any of this stuff is for, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Sadly.\nMIKLEV: Why ‘sadly’?\nDOCTOR: Because these computer storage drives are linked to that main system, which from the catalogue index on this terminal contains the minds and memories of the students the Rani has operated on.\nMIKLEV: That’s horrible!\nDOCTOR: To say the least. Living minds trapped inside the machine... You’re very quiet, Peri.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN I don’t know what to say...\nMIKLEV: (SLIGHTLY OFF) There’s more behind this screen.\nMIKLEV: (FX: SCREEN SLIDES BACK. THE SOUND OF THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS INCREASES. )\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 106\nMIKLEV: (SURPRISED) Oh.\nDOCTOR: I thought I said not to touch anything! — But since you have,\nDOCTOR: let’s see what you’ve found.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 107\nMIKLEV: (AGHAST) Bodies! Loads of them —\nDOCTOR: Still ticking over, just about.\nMIKLEV: Who are these people?\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN (SEEING HER ‘CONTEMPORARIES’) They’re all so... old.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Which is why they needed new bodies.\nMIKLEV: New bodies?\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN These are the bodies of the people whose minds the Rani has transplanted into the students.\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Or rather, it’s wrong. Totally and utterly wrong.\nMIKLEV: But if the minds have been transferred, why is she keeping their bodies alive, like this?\nDOCTOR: The Rani isn’t one to waste anything. Maybe it’s so she can threaten to put the minds back in their original bodies if these people don’t cooperate.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN But surely the Rani is working for these people?\nDOCTOR: The Rani is working for herself. Though I imagine these poor unfortunates believe she’s working for them. I suspect they’re in for a shock.\nMIKLEV: Doctor — over here. This one’s raised up higher than the others.\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER) Ah, yes, an Overseer, there had to be one.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Is she alive?\nMIKLEV: She’s breathing. But, wired up to the systems. The cables go right up under that hood that covers her head.\nDOCTOR: The students’ brains form a complete networked system. But left to their own devices they’1ll simply remain a crowd of isolated individuals. The Rani needs to link a living, organic brain into the systems to take control.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN The Overseer?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Someone to organise the information within the system. It all needs codifying and cataloguing, analysing and interpreting. I suspect this is the Rani’s real end game. A vast computational matrix that draws on the minds of the most brilliant students in every field.\nMIKLEV: Controlled by whoever this is?\nDOCTOR: Controlled by the Rani. This poor person will be slaved to the system, interpreting her instructions. Eventually they will be subsumed — losing all free will and slaved to the over-riding program.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN She’d do all this just to build a computer?\nDOCTOR: To get whatever it is this computer was built to calculate.\nMIKLEV: But who is this? Do you know?\nDOCTOR: I think I do. And so do you.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN We do?\nMIKLEV: Who?\nDOCTOR: Help me raise the hood...\nDOCTOR: Meet Professor Baxton!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN You knew?\nDOCTOR: I knew there had to be a reason for the Rani to take her place. Now we know why — to disguise the fact that the real Professor Baxton was down here, plugged into the systems.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN I guess that explains it.\nDOCTOR: Looking at these readings, it explains why the Rani needs me too.\nMIKLEV: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because Professor Baxton is barely keeping the systems in order. Her mind can’t cope with the conflicting requirements of so many individual brains vying for attention.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN And yours could?\nDOCTOR: Easily. I am the final component of the Rani’s plan.\nMIKLEV: So what do we do about it?\nDOCTOR: You go back to the corridor and keep watch. Let me know if you see anyone coming.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 110\nMIKLEV: Will do.\nDOCTOR: Now then, we have work to do.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN (INCREASINGLY TIRED) You really think the Rani is going to betray these people?\nDOCTOR: These are only their bodies, Peri. The real people are walking about out there in their stolen forms.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN So what do we do about it?\nDOCTOR: I think a little sabotage would be in order, don’t you?\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 111\nRANI: Lizzo — did you leave the door to the lab open? I told you to seal it.\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN I did. I’m sure I did.\nRANI: Forgive me my lack of faith. I trusted you to keep the Doctor\nRANI: guarded, too.\nREEV: You think they’re in there?\nMIKLEV: (CLOSE, TO HIMSELF) Oh that’s not good...\nMIKLEV: (FX: MIKLEV RUNS BACK TOWARDS THE SCREENED AREA. THE RANI, REEV AND LIZZO ENTER. )\nRANI: If the Doctor gets in here, he could ruin everything.\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: The first thing is to make sure that I can reverse the process and return the students’ minds to their own bodies.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN (OLD & TIRED) But... but, what will happen to the people in their bodies now? To their minds?\nDOCTOR: Contrary to the intergalactic criminal code, Peri, possession is not nine-tenths of the [law.]\nDOCTOR: (FX: PERI KNOCKS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH CLATTERS TO THE FLOOR. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Careful — that’s a di-polarising condenser. I told you not to\nDOCTOR: touch anything!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN sorry.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, try not to drop anything else. Some of this stuff —\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Peri? Are you all right? You look... Oh no...\nMIKLEV: (BREATHLESS) The Rani’s coming. Quick — we have close this\nMIKLEV: screen.\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN No. Get away from the controls.\nMIKLEV: You don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Yes, she does. Look at her, Miklev.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 113\nMIKLEV: But — she’s got so, So...\nDOCTOR: Old.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Move away from the screen. Or I’1l shoot you. Thank you for the gun, Doctor.\nMIKLEV: Peri?!\nDOCTOR: But that’s just it — you’re not Peri, are you? I’m sorry, Miklev — your rescue was too late.\nRANI: How kind of you to stop by, Doctor. As you can see, the whining Ms Brown has long since been dealt with.\nDOCTOR: What have you done with her? What have you done with Peri?\nRANI: Her intelligence, such as it is, has already been incorporated into the system. But don’t worry, you’ll be reunited soon enough... in mind, but not in body!\nRANI: END OF PART THREE\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 114"

What have you done with Peri?\nRANI: Her intelligence, such as it is, has already been incorporated into the system. But don’t worry, you’ll be reunited soon enough... in mind, but not in body!\nRANI: PERI-ALIEN Help me, please. I feel so weak.\nRANI: Reev — get an auto-injector. I’ll take that gun.\nREEV: Of course.\nMIKLEV: We have to do something, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing we can do, Miklev. Not while the Rani holds all the cards. And the gun.\nMIKLEV: At least Peri’s getting sorted out. Or whoever she really is.\nDOCTOR: We don’t know who any of these people really are.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 115\nRANI: Then now might be a good time to enlighten you. You realise the sleepers in here are the donors whose minds now inhabit my students?\nMIKLEV: Yes, we worked that out.\nRANI: The toothless old man at the end used to be Carlos Milhaven, owner of a multi-planetary industrial conglomerate. Now he is Reev. Next to him is Mira Vandweezi —\nMIKLEV: As in the benefactor of the Library!\nRANI: Once, she was president of the Sirian Export Bureau. Now, she is Lizzo.\nDOCTOR: All important people, then.\nRANI: Important, and rich.\nDOCTOR: And which one is now Peri?\nRANI: The Countess Valadska — there.\nMIKLEV: But she’s ugly. I mean, like hideous.\nRANI: Old age does that. To some. Others are more fortunate — isn’t that right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: However long-lived we Time Lords may be, no-one cheats death!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN (BACK TO ‘NORMAL’.) We can. You thought I was ugly, but now I’m young again. Ready to live life to the full.\nMIKLEV: Someone else’s life!\nMIKLEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 116\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN You think that matters to us?\nDOCTOR: It should. Especially as the Rani can’t keep the ravages of age at bay for long.\nRANI: I’ve told them — it’s just a temporary side-effect.\nDOCTOR: Temporary?\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN The Rani has given us new life. We won’t let you take that from us.\nRANI: Sit down, Doctor. Next to Professor Baxton.\nDOCTOR: For the last time, Rani —\nRANI: Sit down or watch me laser Peri Brown’s head from her shoulders!\nRANI: PERI-ALIEN You would not...!\nRANI: Be quiet, Countess. The brain won’t be damaged, I can retrieve your scintillating personality afterwards.\nRANI: PERI-ALIEN But... I’d feel it. It would hurt.\nRANI: Very probably.

The ultimate advantage. All Time Lords now that every time-space event creates ripples. Each one grows outwards, larger and larger, causing unforeseen consequences. Well, they won’t be unforeseen for long.\nDOCTOR: You’re talking about Chaos Theory again, just like in your lecture.\nRANI: With this system I’ll be able to determine the tiny events I need to set in motion to lead to the larger, long-term consequences I desire. Releasing butterflies to create hurricanes whenever and wherever I choose.\nMIKLEV: Hurricanes?\nDOCTOR: She’s not talking about the weather, Miklev.

She could show me more respect.\nMIKLEV: Can’t you see that what you’re doing — all this — it’s wrong?!\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN There’s no point in running. The others are on their way.\nMIKLEV: Listen. You can still put things right. Let the Doctor help you put things right.\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN And give up our new, young bodies?\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN Become old and frail and ugly again?\nMIKLEV: Think about them.

Back at the Academy? You, me, Drax, Mortimus, ‘Nosebung’ Vanse11...\nRANI: I’d sooner forget.\nDOCTOR: You know, sometime we should have a proper reunion. Great days, they were! Great days...\nRANI: No, they were ghastly. — Doctor, now that you’ve finished reminiscing, I need you to break the habits of your lifetimes and bring some discipline to bear upon my Elite.\nDOCTOR: Me? I’m no martinet. Could you really find no-one more suitable?\nRANI: My system is a Matrix in microcosm — a fact that appears to have eluded you thus far.\nDOCTOR: Ah, you need a bit of the old Gallifreyan brain hardware!\nRANI: Time Lord synaptic wiring is more suitable, yes. Professor Baxton was merely a stand-in.\nDOCTOR: That genius mind, an expediency to be discarded? — You’1l sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve your own ends. That’s the difference between us, isn’t it? I value life, all life. You treat it as a glorified experiment.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 121\nRANI: What are you bleating on about? The bodies that these minds used to inhabit haven’t been wasted. I could have let them die.\nDOCTOR: Am I supposed to be impressed that you didn’t? Thankful, even?\nRANI: I have allowed the old and dying a new lease of life by making use of otherwise useless bodies. And in return for their new lease of life, they have made sizeable financial contributions to this university. I don’t know what you’re complaining about.\nDOCTOR: You have helped these poor old rich people to murder — yes, murder! — healthy young students with their whole lives ahead of them.\nRANI: Rubbish. I just promised them renewed youth. I wasn’t specific about how I was planning to deliver it.\nDOCTOR: You mean you didn’t tell them they were stealing other people’s bodies?\nRANI: Once they woke up and found their donor was in effect already dead, they all seemed perfectly at ease with the situation.\nDOCTOR: Only you, Rani — only you can leave me speechless.\nRANI: Good. So now you’ve shut up, I can let the system assimilate your mind and absorb your consciousness into the datastream.\nDOCTOR: What, you’re just going to leave me here?\nRANI: There is one final mind still to be added to the mix.\nDOCTOR: You mean Miklev.\nRANI: He really is quite brilliant. So much potential.\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR: Potential that you are about to snuff out.\nRANI: Potential that I shall realise and harness. (TURNS TO EXIT) We’re making history, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER HER) I have just one last request. Rani! (HER REAL\nNAME: ) Ushas, please...!\nRANI: (STOPS) Don’t call me that.\nDOCTOR: Let me see Peri.\nRANI: What, her body?\nDOCTOR: One last time. Just to remember what she looks like.\nRANI: Sentimentality was the reason you graduated with just a Double Gamma, Doctor. It was always your downfall. — Oh, very well.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) One day, Rani, perhaps it will be. But not today, I hope...\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 123\nCUT TO: (FX: THERE ARE ABOUT HALF A DOZEN STUDENTS ARRIVED IN ADDITION TO REEV, LIZZO, AND PERI.)\nCUT TO: PERI-ALIEN So what’s the next stage?\nCUT TO: LIZZO-ALIEN I’m sure she’1ll tell us in a minute.\nREEV: I thought once she had her precious system up and running, and we were all in our new bodies — (that would be it)\nRANI: Good, you’re all here.\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN All except the Vice Chancellor.\nRANI: He’s busy.

At least you can’t have her character.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: The real Peri would never be so heartless, Countess. Peri, and all these students, they had their whole lives ahead of them. You've had yours, and very privileged it was too. A Countess, no less. And back in the days when education was galactically- funded. Not like today. The students whose bodies you’ve stolen had to scrimp and save to pay for their education.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN I’ve given back more than enough. I paid for the science facility here at the CAGE.\nDOCTOR: How very magnanimous. You’ve all done so much. But that is rather the point, isn’t it? You’ve all led your lives to the full. But are you grateful for it, for the opportunities you’ve had, the friends you’ve made, the things you’ve achieved?\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Of course I am!\nDOCTOR: Yet you steal exactly those things from Peri.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN We didn’t know that was the plan.\nDOCTOR: But you’re happy to go along with it.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN There’s no other way.\nDOCTOR: There is always another way. But you don’t appreciate that, do you. Any more than you appreciate Peri’s jacket.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re not wearing it. Probably dumped on the floor somewhere, discarded as easily as you discarded the person who used to wear it.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN You can’t compare a jacket to a person.\nDOCTOR: I think that was the point I was making, actually. But if do you want to know about Peri — about the real person whose life you have usurped, then find her jacket. Check the pockets... I wasn’t lying you know.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN What about?\nDOCTOR: The rapid ageing. There’s no cure. You think you’ve got a whole new life ahead of you, but you’re wrong.

Get back on the other side of the screen, or I’11l shoot the lot of you.\nMIKLEV: I think she means it.\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN She can’t escape.\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN There’s no other way out.\nREEV: If you close the screen, we’ll just slide it open again.\nDOCTOR: (D) Do as she says. The Rani will shoot you. You can’t risk your lives for us.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE STUDENTS MOVE BEHIND THE SCREEN. THE RANI OPERATES A CONTROL AND A WALL SLIDES ACROSS — METALLIC AND HEAVY — SLAMMING INTO PLACE AGAINST ANOTHER WALL. )\nRANI: The advantages of a Magna-struct building. Instant wall.\nDOCTOR: They’1l soon work out how to demagnetise it. You can’t keep them out forever.\nRANI: I don’t have to. Soon they’1ll all age to death. Now keep quiet while I reroute the university power grid through your control systems. That will be enough to burn out any resistance still in theres,\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 142\nMIKLEV: We should have stayed. We could have rushed her.\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN And died in the attempt?\nMIKLEV: Don’t you get it? You’re dying anyway!\nMIKLEV: PERI-ALIEN He’s right.\nREEV: (OLD AND TIRED) I’m not giving up this body. Not even —\nREEV: (CONT’D) (GASPS IN HORROR) My hand — look at my hand. It’s so old!\nREEV: PERI-ALIEN Not even to let someone else live their life to the full?\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 143\nLIZZO: It’s getting hot.\nREEV: Burning.\nPERI: Doctor — what’s happening?\nDOCTOR: It’s the Rani. She’s routed the entire university power system through here to render us to pure data.\nPERI: (IN PAIN) Doctor — it hurts!\nDOCTOR: I can see it. Every node and link on the network. I’m the Overseer, I can see it all.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR Can you stop it?\nDOCTOR: Better than that. But I need your help — all of you, working together. Not as individuals but as a team.\nVICE: CHANCELLOR The heat...\nREEV: Unbearable heat...\nDOCTOR: Then think of something cold. Think of — yes, think of snow!\nPERI: Snow?\nDOCTOR: A single snowflake can’t cause an avalanche. Not on its own. But all of us together... Focus — there, that power router... And there — that opening mechanism. Focus!\nDOCTOR: PERI/REEV/LIZZO/VICE CHANCELLOR Focus! Focus! Focus! Focus!\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 144\nRANI: Get out of that, you garrulous simpleton!\nDOCTOR: (D; WITH EFFORT) Simpleton, am I?\nRANI: Everything’s powering down. — Doctor, what have you done?\nDOCTOR: (D) I’ve simply diverted the power away from your systems. There’s enough to keep us alive in here, but not for your computations.\nRANI: You can’t keep that up for- [ever] (DOUBLE TAKE) Diverted? Where to?\nRANI: The Magna-struct controls!\nDOCTOR: (D) Focus, everyone! We’re trying to build a cage!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Stop her!\nDOCTOR: (D) Now what are you lot doing? — Focus!!!\nRANI: All of you, keep back! Keep back, or I’11 shoot! — You haven’t won, Doctor. As soon as I get back to my TARDIS I shall simply set up again somewhere else, away from your meddling. (SHE RUNS OUT)\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN Come on, get after her!\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 145 (FX: THE STUDENTS RUN AFTER THE RANI. MIKLEV DISCONNECTS THE EQUIPMENT. )\nMIKLEV: Doctor, are you all right? Let me get you out of this thing.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. But we were about to imprison the Rani in her own Magna-struct walls!\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN The others have gone after her.\nMIKLEV: It’s too late, isn’t it? She’s going to get away.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I saw something ever so\nDOCTOR: interesting on the security cameras earlier...\nCUT TO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 146\nCUT TO: (FX: RANI RUNS UP TO DOOR; LIZZO, REEV AND OTHER STUDENTS BEHIND. )\nRANI: Get back! — I’m warning you, girl, I shan’t let you stop me.\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN Stop you from what?\nREEV: That’s the chemical stores, there’s no way out of there.\nRANI: It’s where my TARDIS is hidden, idiot. Now — get back!\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN Locked out, are you?\nRANI: The mechanism’s shorted out for some reason.\nREEV: Maintenance in this university is terrible.\nRANI: Easily fixed with a quick blast from this —\nRANI: Goodbye. I can’t say it’s been [pleasant.] (PULLS TO SLIDE OPEN DOOR)\nRANI: (SPLUTTERING, WASHED DOWN CORRIDOR) Doctor — this is your doing!\nREEV: (OLD) Someone, grab her!\nREEV: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 147\nREEV: PERI-ALIEN What happened?\nDOCTOR: I’d say someone left the tap running. Miklev-!\nMIKLEV: (GRABBING RANI) Got her!\nRANI: Get your paws off me, you — you revolting student!\nRANI: LIZZO-ALIEN A tap left running caused all that?!\nDOCTOR: Not directly, no. I’m guessing the sink overflowed, causing the electrical sockets to short... which caused a spark, bang, which knocked one of those canisters of chemicals into the water pooling on the floor... potassium, probably?\nRANI: (GROAN) A pyrophoric reaction!\nDOCTOR: There speaks the chemist, exactly. Whompf! A puff of flame caused the sprinklers to be activated...\nMIKLEV: But not the alarm?\nDOCTOR: Possibly, but you’d cut the power to the whole Facility by then, I expect. So the sensor that should have cut the sprinklers out was never tripped, so the water level continued to rise until the volume caused the entire shelf unit to tip over, crash, into the sink — severing the main water pipe. With a capacity of, what, one hundred and sixty cubic feet, that little storeroom would soon fill up with, er.. (SNAPS FINGERS) Miklev?\nMIKLEV: (CALCULATING) One thousand two hundred gallons of water?\nRANI: One thousand one hundred and ninety-six.\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: There you are. The hurricane caused by the beat of a butterfly’s wings.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN Listen. Sirens!\nMIKLEV: That was me, sorry. I sent for Galactic Security when I was in the V-C’s Office. You know - like you suggested, Doctor.\nRANI: You did what?!\nDOCTOR: The police in this sector of space are marvellous. They’1l have you scheduled for trial before you can say ‘Honorary Degree in Moral Philosophy.’\nRANI: (SCOFFS) Police! I don’t abide by petty laws and restrictions.\nDOCTOR: No, you never did. And in this instance, neither do I. — Let her go, Miklev.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN What?\nMIKLEV: Doctor, you can’t be serious.\nDOCTOR: She’s guilty of first-degree murder. That’s a mandatory full-life term in this sector of space.\nRANI: Let alone all the historical charges they might want to take into consideration.\nDOCTOR: Miasimia Goria, yes. But the thing is, Miklev — she and I are Time Lords. Immortal, barring accidents.\nRANI: A full life term — to us, that’s a cruel and unusual punishment.\nRANI: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: Too cruel. Please, Miklev. Let her go.\nMIKLEV: If — if you’re sure.. (RELEASES RANT)\nDOCTOR: I still remember her as she was, in her Academy days. The brightest star of all of us, in so many ways. I suppose I still hope that one day, she might yet redeem herself.\nRANI: (HARSHLY) You’re a sentimental fool, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Almost anyone else in the universe would mean that as a compliment.\nRANI: Goodbye, Doctor. (WALKING AWAY, SPLASHING THROUGH WATER) This little encounter has only made the memory of what I’11 one day do to your current incarnation all the more enjoyable.\nRANI: PERI-ALIEN What’s she mean, ‘memory’?\nDOCTOR: It means... she’s met me in my future, but her past. (CALLING INTO AIR) Can you hear me, you lot in the system? — Focus! Focus!!!\nRANI: (CALLING BACK) Too late, Doctor!!!\nRANI: Wait. What’s that [noise]\nRANI: (FX: .. AND THE FLOOR UNDER THE RANI SLIDES AWAY. WATER POURING AWAY WITH HER AS SHE FALLS DOWN THE HOLE)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OUT) Now seal her in! (FX: MAGNASTRUCT FLOOR SLIDES OVER THE HOLE) She can stay down there ‘til Galactic Security arrive.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN You demagnetised the floor...?\nDOCTOR: It’s not just the walls that are made by Magna-struct, you know.\nMIKLEV: All that you said — that was playing for time?\nDOCTOR: Giving my friends a chance to get the panels in order. Tesselation. Complicated.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN So you’re not going to let her get away with it?\nDOCTOR: Certainly not. They can throw away the key so far as I’m\nDOCTOR: concerned. The only question is.. what are we to do with you lot, hm?\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE RANI SEALED INTO A CELL MADE OF MAGNASTRUCT. WAIST DEEP IN WATER. CALLING UP)\nRANI: Let me out of here! Doctor! I demand you let me out of here! I’m a scientist not, not — some third-rated Double Gamma! (DESPERATE,\nBANGING: WALLS) Let me out! I’11 kill you! Doctor! You don’t know it, but I will kill you! (SLUMPS BACK, GIVING UP) Yes, I’1l kill you, Doctor. And sooner than you think...!\nBANGING: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: You’re sure you want to go ahead with this?\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN We've discussed it, and we all agree.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN We’ve had our time. We’ve lived our lives once. Now it’s someone else’s turn.\nMIKLEV: Especially as it was agree to the Doctor’s proposal or get locked up by Galactic Security until you suddenly age to death.\nREEV: The Rani tricked us. Even though we didn’t know what was going to happen...\nREEV: PERI-ALIEN .We shouldn’t have gone with the flow.\nDOCTOR: For what it’s worth, no single drop of water believes it’s responsible for the flood. You’ve made the right choice. At last.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN You can put us safely into the computer system?\nDOCTOR: I can. The minds in the Rani’s system are still conscious and sentient, so I can effect a total reverse transfer. You’1ll survive inside the system, just as the students did.\nDOCTOR: LIZZO-ALIEN Then we’re not dead yet. Not really.\nDOCTOR: PERI-ALIEN And while there’s life...\nDOCTOR: The only person I can’t restore is the Vice Chancellor. But he’s agreed to remain inside the system as Overseer. He’ll make sure your minds remain active, stimulating debate and discussion.\nDOCTOR: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 153\nMIKLEV: You’ve all got a lot of experience to draw on.\nMIKLEV: LIZZO-ALIEN It could get quite lively.\nDOCTOR: I’m counting on it. You’1ll be a formidable and useful resource for the university’s research projects. The ultimate Brains Trust. Right, if you’d all take your places?\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) And Miklev, if you come over here.\nMIKLEV: What do you want me to do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I want you to press this button. And get your friends back.\nMIKLEV: Now?\nDOCTOR: Now.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MIKLEV PRESSES THE BUTTON — A RISING HUM OF POWER, THEN CUT\nTO: )\nTO: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 154\nTO: (FX: APPLAUSE. IT FADES AS BAXTON SPEAKS, OVER MICROPHONE TO A\nPACKED AUDIENCE: )\nPACKED AUDIENCE: [REAL] BAXTON\nPACKED AUDIENCE: And now, in the unfortunate absence of the Vice Chancellor, it falls to me to present this Medal of Supreme Excellence to Student Miklev.\nMIKLEV: (STEPPING FORWARD FROM SIDE OF STAGE) Thank you, Professor Baxton.\nBAXTON: (CONT’D) And we are also awarding an honorary degree...\nPERI: (LOW) Here we go.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) How do I look?\nBAXTON: . in Botany, To Miss Perpugilliam Brown.\nPERI: (SURPRISED) What? To me?\nDOCTOR: Don’t be so surprised. No one deserves it more. Well, except perhaps — me. (PUSHES HER) Go on, then!\nPERI: (WALKING UP TO BAXTON) Thank you, I don’t know what to say.\nBAXTON: And finally, it gives me great pleasure to award this honorary\nBAXTON: degree in Moral Philosophy to... the Doctor.\nBAXTON: THE RANI ELITE by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: Oh thank you. Thank you so much. It is thoroughly deserved of course. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Actually, if I could say just a few words... I have some notes here\nDOCTOR: somewhere, if you’ll bear with me.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR UNFOLDS A LARGE SHEAF OF PAPERS — LOTS OF RUSTLING. WE CAN BE IN NO DOUBT THAT THIS WILL BE A LONG SPEECH. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT'D) Here we are.\nPERI: Doctor, just how long is that speech?\nDOCTOR: Yes, settle down there at the back, please. Now, accustomed as I am to public speaking...\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUT, PERHAPS FORTUNATELY, THE CLOSING THEME DROWNS OUT\nWHATEVER: HE HAS TO SAY.)\nWHATEVER: THE END"
