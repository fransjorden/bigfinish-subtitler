I don’t feel at all well.\nDOCTOR: I’m not surprised. Unshielded temporal transference is not the most comfortable way to travel.\nNYSSA: So that’s what we’ve been doing.\nDOCTOR: With the collapse of the time bubble, we were cast adrift in time.

Not to mention freezing cold. I thought churches were supposed to be joyous places. Full of worship and singing.\nDOCTOR: That’s just on Sundays. And the ambient temperature can be accredited to the fact that it’s winter.\nNYSSA: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: There’s snow at the windows. (MUSING) I wonder which particular shore our ‘tide of time’ has washed us up on.\nNYSSA: (TEASING) Don’t Time Lords have an instinct for temporal placement?\nDOCTOR: Whatever gave you that idea?

Much as I hate to complain, the snow’s blowing into my eyes, and I’m not exactly dressed for blizzard conditions.

What can I get you?\nDOCTOR: Ginger beer for me. Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Just water, thank you.\nNYSSA: (FX: LIGHT BEEPING AS MRS WITHERS ENTERS THE ORDER INTO THE TOUCH-PAD TILL ON THE BAR)\nMRS WITHERS: Right you are, m’dears. And how about something to eat? I have some lovely hot pot.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, yes. Very warming on such a cold night. (BEAT, AS MRS WITHERS ENTERS THE HOT POT ORDER INTO THE TILL) Excuse me, do you mind if I ask a question?\nMRS WITHERS: Ask away, dear.\nDOCTOR: You are Mrs Marjorie Withers, aren’t you?\nMRS WITHERS: Indeed I am, dear. For my sins.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 6\nDOCTOR: Mrs Withers, what year is this?\nDOCTOR: (FX: SILENCE, APART FROM B/G CRACKLING FIRE; CHRISTMAS CAROLS; WIND AND SNOW OUTSIDE)\nDOCTOR: Mrs Withers?\nMRS WITHERS: Awful weather, isn’t it? I’ll get you that hotpot.\nNYSSA: What’s wrong with her, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Selective memory loss, caused by a recent trauma? Some kind of mental conditioning? How old would you say she is, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. Sixty perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. When I last stayed here — in 1982, if memory serves — Mrs Withers was in her seventies. Which ought to make this the mid- 1960s.\nNYSSA: My knowledge of Earth technology isn’t perfect, Doctor, but... isn’t that unlikely?\nDOCTOR: Not unlikely — impossible. That’s a touch screen till behind the bar. And the dartboard has an electronic score sheet. If not for Mrs Withers, I’d say this was the early twenty-first century.\nNYSSA: So what does all this mean, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Yet.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MRS WITHERS REAPPEARS THROUGH THE TWO-WAY DOOR & APPROACHES THE TABLE NEAREST THEM)\nMRS WITHERS: Here we are, m’dears! Settle yourselves down by the fire.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris T\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THEY DO SO, PULLING THE CHAIRS OUT & SITTING DOWN.

HE GETS SOME MONEY OUT OF HIS POCKET — A COLLECTION OF NOTES & COINS — AND PLACES THEM ON THE TABLE)\nDOCTOR: Come along, Nyssa. I think we need to cast our net a little further afield.\nNYSSA: (STANDING UP, TOO, WITH CHAIR SCRAPING) Go outside again, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Well, unless you’d rather stay for dessert?\nNYSSA: No, thank you.\nNYSSA: (FX: THEY OPEN THE PUB DOOR AGAIN & EXIT, SHUTTING THE DOOR\nBEHIND THEM. CUT TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 8\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING) I hope fifty pounds was enough.\nNYSSA: (ALSO SHOUTING) More than, I should imagine. So what are we looking for now, Doctor? The TARDIS, or an explanation for what’s happening here?\nDOCTOR: Well... either would be welcome. The important thing is to keep an open mind.\nNYSSA: I think I’d find it easier to do that if I’d had the opportunity to dress for these conditions.\nDOCTOR: Mind over matter, Nyssa. Think warm thoughts.\nNYSSA: Thank you, Doctor. That’s so helpful.\nNYSSA: (FX: THROUGH THE BLIZZARD COMES THE APPROACHING SOUND OF A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE, RATTLING OVER COBBLES. THE CLACK OF HOOVES BEARS DOWN UPON THEM)\nNYSSA: (ALARMED) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I hear it, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Where is it? I can’t see anything!\nDOCTOR: More sound effects, that’s all. The snow’s so thick that a carriage would barely make a sound in these conditions.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DIN OF THE CARRIAGE REACHES A CRESCENDO... THEN FADES, LEAVING A GHOSTLY ECHO)\nDOCTOR: Are you all right, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: A little shaky. Though I’ve yet to decide whether that’s due to cold or fear.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 9\nNYSSA: Yet more sound effects?\nDOCTOR: Not this time. Look above us, Nyssa. On the roofs and telephone\nDOCTOR: wires.\nNYSSA: (GASPS) There’s hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: Carrion crows. Said to be harbingers of doom.\nNYSSA: Look out, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (SHAKEN) That was rather too close for comfort. Its wing-tip brushed my face.\nNYSSA: Why would it attack you like that?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Crows are scavengers by nature and, although they do sometimes supplement their diet with live flesh, they don’t generally prey on anything much larger than field mice.\nNYSSA: That one was obviously an exception.\nDOCTOR: Not so much of one, I fear. Look, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: What are they doing?\nDOCTOR: Massing for attack. (SUDDENLY URGENT) Here they come!\nDOCTOR: Run, Nyssa!\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 10\nNYSSA: Where?\nDOCTOR: Let’s try... this cottage!\nDOCTOR: (FX: B/G HOWLING WIND AND SCREECHING CROWS; F/G THE RAPID UNLATCHING OF A GATE; THUD OF FEET THROUGH SNOW)\nNYSSA: Quickly, Doctor!

THE CROWS’ FLUTTERING & CAWING DIES AWAY DURING THE SCENE)\nNYSSA: (GASPING) You’re quite the housebreaker, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Little trick I picked up from the Great Omani. (BEAT) Now, I wonder what made the crows behave like that?\nNYSSA: Perhaps they were just hungry? Unable to find food?\nDOCTOR: No, it wasn’t that. They didn’t attack us, for one thing.\nNYSSA: (ASTONISHED) Didn’t attack! What do you think-\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY, DECISIVELY) How many times did they peck you, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Well... none. But only because I fought them off.\nDOCTOR: You think so? Their reactions are quicker than yours. And their beaks are razor-sharp. If they’d wanted to draw blood, they would certainly have done so.\nNYSSA: So what were they doing?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Assessing us? Warning us? Deliberately impeding our progress?\nNYSSA: Are they really that intelligent?\nDOCTOR: Not ordinarily. Interesting, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: So what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: Consider our options. Let’s try through here.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 12\nNYSSA: This place is completely empty.\nDOCTOR: And has been for some time, judging by the dust. (BEAT) I’m guessing this leads to the kitchen.\nNYSSA: Oh, goodness!\nDOCTOR: Fascinating! (QUIETLY) ‘When the hounds of spring are on winter’s traces...’\nNYSSA: Are we really looking out on to a spring day, Doctor? It’s not an illusion?\nDOCTOR: If it is, it’s a convincing one. I’m more inclined to believe this anomaly is temporal rather than psychological.\nNYSSA: Do you think it’s safe to go outside?\nDOCTOR: I don’t see why not. Just keep an eye out for those crows.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 13\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE HOWLING BLIZZARD HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED BY THE TRILL OF BIRDSONG)\nNYSSA: Look, Doctor. You can still see patches of melting snow here and there.\nDOCTOR: An instant thaw, followed by an artificially-induced spring. Impressive technology.\nNYSSA: Technology? You don’t think this could be a natural phenomenon then? A freak result of climate change, for instance?\nDOCTOR: Five minutes ago those trees were bare. Now they’re laden with blossom. And look there, Nyssa. Bluebells.\nNYSSA: Is that significant?\nDOCTOR: It means this is April or May. And whilst spring snowfalls are not uncommon, there’s still a definite nip in the air. It would need to be considerably hotter than this to affect such a rapid thaw.\nNYSSA: So what is going on here, Doctor?\nNYSSA: (FX: A DISTANT CRY OF ‘HOWSAT?’— TAKEN UP BY A SMALL BUT VOCIFEROUS CROWD)\nDOCTOR: (OBVIOUS DELIGHT) Well, a cricket match, for one thing. A little early in the year, perhaps, but a surer sign of civilisation would be impossible to find. Come along, Nyssa. The village green is... this way.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 14\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE CLICK OF LEATHER ON WILLOW; MUTTERS AND SHOUTS FROM PLAYERS AND SPECTATORS. THE DOCTOR & NYSSA ARRIVE & STOP.)\nDOCTOR: Here we are. Look, Nyssa, there’s even a tea tent. I’11 treat you to a macaroon.\nNYSSA: Don’t become too complacent, Doctor. Your harbingers of doom are still overhead.\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Hmm?\nNYSSA: Those awful crows. Dozens of them.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t mind them. They seem to have lost interest in us for the time being.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING) Good shot! Well hit!\nNYSSA: (EXASPERATED) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Hmm?\nNYSSA: Shouldn’t we be asking about the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) You’re quite right. I’1ll make a few discreet enquiries, starting with this fellow. (CLEARS HIS THROAT) Excuse me?\nNYSSA: (QUIETLY) Perhaps he’s deaf, Doctor. He is rather an old gentlemen.\nDOCTOR: (RAISING HIS VOICE) Excuse me, I don’t suppose you happen to have seen a tall blue box around here?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 15\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue box? About so high? Says ‘Police’ above the door?\nDOCTOR WHO: I don’t think he understands me, Nyssa. He’s looking at me rather strangely.\nNYSSA: (NERVOUSLY) Something’s happening, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What?\nNYSSA: The cricketers. They’ve stopped their game and they’re heading towards us.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS CHEERILY) Hello there! Please, carry on. Don’t mind us.\nNYSSA: They’re all coming this way. I don’t like this, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERS) Get ready to retreat, Nyssa. Back the way we came.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FAINT, THEN RAPIDLY RISING SOUND OF A DESCENDING SPACE CRAFT)\nNYSSA: Doctor, what’s that?\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING ABOVE THE INCREASING ENGINE NOISE) It’s a passenger shuttle. A space craft.\nNYSSA: (ALSO SHOUTING) Alien?\nDOCTOR: No. Look at the insignia. It’s from Earth.\nNYSSA: A woman from the 1960s. Weather-altering technology. Spaceships. What’s happening here, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m beginning to wonder. I’1ll ask one of the cricketers.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 16\nNYSSA: You don’t think they’re hostile?\nDOCTOR: There’s no indication of it. They’re ignoring us. (BEAT) Excuse\nDOCTOR: me. (BEAT) I say, excuse me.\nCRICKETER: (SPEAKS SLOWLY, AS THOUGH HE’S NOT ALL THERE) What?\nDOCTOR: Would you mind telling me — who’s in the shuttle?\nCRICKETER: Visitors.\nDOCTOR: And what visitors might those be?\nCRICKETER: Visitors. Come every day. ‘Cept Monday.\nDOCTOR: I see. And where do the visitors come from?\nCRICKETER: Outside.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the shuttle’s powering down. It’s landing on the village green.\nDOCTOR: And here are the welcoming committee.\nNYSSA: That’s not a twenty-first century vehicle either, is it?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s a skimmer. Developed around the fortieth.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Nyssa. Let’s introduce ourselves.\nNYSSA: Is that wise, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 17\nDOCTOR: We won’t know until we do it, will we?\nBARCLAY: Three visitors! I remember when we used to get eight full shuttles a day.\nLYSETTE: That’s the Trust’s fault, Dad. If they didn’t keep cutting our budget, we’d still be pulling in the punters.\nBARCLAY: (GRUNTS) Aye, but that doesn’t alter the fact that they’1ll still blame us. They’re just looking for an excuse to close us down.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Good morning! Or is it afternoon? Time just seems to fly here.\nBARCLAY: (ASTONISHED) Who in Creation are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and this is my friend, Nyssa.\nBARCLAY: That’s as may be, but.. who are you?\nNYSSA: We're visitors. (BEAT) Like the people in the shuttle?\nLYSETTE: Visitors? But that’s impossible. How did you get here?\nNYSSA: I’m afraid that’s a little hard to explain.\nBARCLAY: You need a level one security code to gain access to the Bubble. (SUDDEN REALISATION) Oh, hang on, I’ve rumbled you. You’re Trust Inspectors, aren’t you? You’ve been sent to make a.. what do they call it? An assessment of our profitability.\nDOCTOR: Is it really that obvious?\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 18\nBARCLAY: (SIGHS) I’ve been dreading this day. Knew it was bound to come sooner or later, of course. But tell me upfront, no mucking about — are you here to close us down?\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily.\nLYSETTE: Maybe we ought to introduce ourselves before we start peppering you with questions. I’m Lysette Barclay and this is my dad, Isaac. (BEAT) But you probably know that already?\nDOCTOR: We know a great deal less than you might think, Miss Barclay. We've been... um, thrown in at the deep end, you might say.\nNYSSA: We arrived in a blizzard.\nLYSETTE: Ah. The winter quarter. Back in the old days we had snowball fights, a Christmas service in the church, mulled wine in the pub. Now the visitors tend to leave in the autumn quarter and the rest of us just stay indoors, batten down the hatches.\nNYSSA: We went to the pub. It did look as though everyone had left in rather a hurry.\nLYSETTE: Stage dressing. We leave the pub like that for the summer lunchtime session. It saves time.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: (MUFFLED; ANGRY) You out there! Are you going to keep us in this tin can all day?\nLYSETTE: Excuse us. Duty calls.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Pretend we aren’t here. We’1ll just..observe.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CHEEP AND BEEP OF KEYPAD-TYPE BUTTONS; LOCKS DISENGAGING; A DOOR HUMMING OPEN. LYSETTE & BARCLAY AD LIB AS THEY OPEN THE DOOR. WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON...)\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 19\nNYSSA: (LOW VOICE) What did Mr Barclay mean about getting access to ‘the Bubble’, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Which must put us somewhere beyond the Critical Age.\nNYSSA: (LV) Critical Age?\nDOCTOR: (LV) By the forty-fifth century, solar flare activity was so extreme that over 95% of the Earth’s surface had become uninhabitable. Not that it really mattered. Humankind had been colonising other planets for centuries by then. Hardly anyone lived on the home world any more.\nNYSSA: (LV) So this is what? The last outpost of civilisation?\nDOCTOR: (LV) Something like that.\nBARCLAY: (EXPANSIVELY) Madam! Gentlemen! Welcome to Stockbridge! I trust you had a pleasant flight?\nRINXO JABBERY: (WARBLING, HIGH-PITCHED ALIEN VOICE) Merely adequate.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: I’ve never endured such a tortuous — or torturous — experience. My poor back feels as though it’s been forced through a fusion grinder.\nBARCLAY: Oh. Well, I’m very sorry (to)-\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Plus the aircon howled like a banshee, and the food was\nALEXIS LINFOOT: appalling.\nVINCENT LINFOOT: (TENTATIVELY) It wasn’t that bad, dear.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Some of us, Vincent, expect basic catering standards for our hard-earned credits. My linguine tasted like the floor scrapings of a containment dome.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 20\nVINCENT LINFOOT: (WEAKLY) My fish was very nice.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: And as for dessert...\nRINXO JABBERY: I, too, found the in-flight sustenance to be lacking in the correct nutrient levels required to sustain comfort...\nNYSSA: (F/G BUT LV) Who’s the purple gentleman with the tentacles, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (LV) He’s a Lucerian. Very scholarly race. Blunt and humourless, but essentially non-aggressive.\nBARCLAY: (CLEARS HIS THROAT) Madam, gentlemen, I’m very sorry for the... er, less than ideal start to your day. My name is Isaac Barclay, and I’m the co-ordinator here at the Stockbridge Heritage Experience. As you know, Stockbridge is one of only three such remaining sites in the entire Northern Hemisphere. Here, we can offer you the long-lost delights of a real English village, beautifully preserved. But before I blather on for too long, I’ll hand you over to my daughter, Lysette, who’1ll be showing you round and answering your questions today. I hope you have a wonderful time and come to love Stockbridge as much as we do. Thank you.\nVINCENT LINFOOT: (APPLAUDS — THEN REALISES HE IS THE ONLY ONE) Oh... er... mmm.\nLYSETTE: Hello everyone. Before we start, I need to confirm a few particulars. According to my data pad, this party should consist of Professor Rinxo Jabbery of the Lucerian Unity...\nRINXO JABBERY: (A BURBLE OF ASSENT) Present!\nLYSETTE: And Mr and Mrs Vincent Linfoot of New Cheadle, Satellite 94.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Present. Obviously.\nLYSETTE: Excellent. If I could just scan your ID chips...\nLYSETTE: ora)\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 21\nDOCTOR WHO: (B/G GENERAL AD LIB CHAT. F/G BARCLAY CHATS TO THE DOCTOR & NYSSA)\nBARCLAY: (EMBARRASSED) Attendances are a little down, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: Evidently history isn’t what it used to be.\nBARCLAY: Can I be blunt, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: By all means.\nBARCLAY: The truth is..we work our socks off here. But we just don’t get the support and funding from your lot that we need and — frankly — deserve. Look around you, Doctor. Not only is this a valuable historical resource, it’s a beautiful place. There’s nowhere like Stockbridge in the entire universe, and it would be an absolute, unparalleled tragedy if we were to lose it.\nDOCTOR: I quite agree.\nBARCLAY: (SURPRISED) Do you?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. And believe me, Mr Barclay, if there’s anything we can do to help keep Stockbridge up and running, we’1ll do it. Won’t we, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Er.. yes. Absolutely.\nBARCLAY: (TAKEN ABACK) Well, that’s... very gratifying to hear, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So tell me, Mr Barclay-\nBARCLAY: Isaac. Call me Isaac.\nDOCTOR: Even better. Tell me, Isaac, how many of you run this place?\nDOCTOR: 1\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 22\nBARCLAY: Well, to be honest with you, that’s one of the reasons why we're falling to rack and ruin. Since the cutbacks, there’ve only been the three of us — myself, Lysette and our tech, Dobson.\nNYSSA: Don’t the villagers help?\nBARCLAY: (LAUGHS) Oh, very droll! I like that: ‘the villagers’!\nNYSSA: (BEWILDERED) Well, don’t they?\nBARCLAY: (SUDDENLY REALIZING SHE’S SERIOUS) Blimey, they really did throw you in at the deep end, didn’t they? Didn’t they give you data packs?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not.\nBARCLAY: (SIGHS) The villagers are nth generation clones. Most of ‘em can barely function as human beings any more. You see, the more we dip into the same gene pool the more it degrades. Life spans get shorter with each generation...\nDOCTOR: And does that apply to the animal life too? The crows, for example?\nBARCLAY: The crows?\nNYSSA: Yes, we were attacked by a flock of crows earlier.\nBARCLAY: Attacked? Really? Well, that shouldn’t happen. The birds and animals are all ALs.\nNYSSA: What are ALs?\nBARCLAY: Now I know you’re teasing me! Artificial life-forms, as you very well know. I’1ll have to get Dobson to look at the inhibitor grid — if he’s not too busy. Problem is, soon as one thing gets fixed, another goes on the blink.\nBARCLAY: 979\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 23\nNYSSA: Have any of your problems here involved time, Mr Ba- Isaac?\nBARCLAY: How do you mean, ‘time’?\nNYSSA: Well, it’s just that when we arrived we heard... sounds. Part of a Christmas carol. A carriage rattling over cobbles. We wondered whether it was caused by some sort of time distortion. The past invading the present.\nBARCLAY: (LAUGHS) You talking about ghosts, miss?\nNYSSA: Well... not exactly.\nDOCTOR: (TERSELY) It was rather an unsettling experience.\nBARCLAY: (CONTROLLING HIMSELF) Yes... I’m sure it was. Forgive me. It’s just.. there’s a simple explanation for what you heard.\nNYSSA: I’d very much like to hear it.\nBARCLAY: We have a sound archive in Stockbridge. Lysette uses the recordings to give her guided tours a bit of oomph. Unfortunately, like everything else round here, the audio system’s on the blink. Random sounds leak through at odd intervals. It’s just something else to add to Dobson’s ever- expanding list.\nDOCTOR: There you are, Nyssa. Sounds effects, as we thought.\nNYSSA: Hmm.\nLYSETTE: (COMING ACROSS) Right, Dad, we’re ready to move out. (LOW VOICE) That Mrs Linfoot’s going to be a bundle of laughs. She complains about everything. Don’t suppose you’d like to come along, would you, Nyssa? See the set-up? I could do with the moral support.\nLYSETTE: 92\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 24\nNYSSA: Well, LI...\nDOCTOR: Yes, why don’t you, Nyssa? You could keep an eye out for... anything interesting.\nNYSSA: (SIGHS) All right. What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: I’d rather like to see the environment system — if Isaac doesn’t mind showing me?\nBARCLAY: No, Doctor. My pleasure.\nLYSETTE: Right then, we’ll leave you to it. See you later.\nBARCLAY: Cheerio, love. Oh, and, er... (LOWERS VOICE) don’t take any nonsense from the old bat.\nLYSETTE: (LAUGHS) I won’t. You ready, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Yes. Doctor; Mr Barclay.\nBARCLAY: See you later, Miss.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Have fun.\nLYSETTE: (OFF; MOVING AWAY) Right then, madam, gentlemen. Our first stop will be the church, the spire of which you can see poking above the rooftops over there. As we head towards it, I’1ll draw your attention to points of interest, starting with the village green to your left. The green is regarded as the focal point of the community, and has been the site of many significant events over the years. A local legend tells of a twelfth century battle between demons and holy men, which apparently resulted in the destruction of Stockbridge Castle, an event that was re- enacted annually until the twenty-first century... (FADES)\nLYSETTE: 9A\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 25\nDOCTOR: It appears the clouds are gathering, Isaac. Has a spring shower been programmed in for the purposes of authenticity?\nBARCLAY: (WEARILY) No, Doctor. The environment receptors must be on the blink again. I’1ll call Dobson and wait for him in the local Environment Station. It’s only on the other side of the Green there.\nDOCTOR: In the bakery?\nBARCLAY: The window display’s a hologram projected onto a transparent resin screen. Wouldn’t do to have a visible ES stuck in the middle of the village, would it? It’d spoil the illusion of olde-worlde charm.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you’re right. Pity the display’s not real though. I’m rather partial to a jam tart.\nLYSETTE: The narrow lane on the right there was once known locally as Witch’s Run. It leads to a pond, where it was claimed so-called witches in the sixteenth century were subjected to an ordeal known as trial by water. This involved the accused being bound hand and foot and thrown into the pond. If he or she sank and drowned — and they invariably did — they were considered to be innocent, whereas if they floated they were thought to be guilty, and were subsequently put to death.\nVINCENT LINFOOT: How fascinating.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Fascinating my foot. It’s utterly vile.\nRINXO JABBERY: And yet another example of the inherent foolishness of your species.\nRINXO JABBERY: ors\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 26\nLYSETTE: Do please examine the waterpump over there. The iron was cast in the village smithy, which we’ll be seeing shortly.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: (OFF; GROWING FAINTER) ‘Inherent foolishness’? In Creation’s name, you don’t honestly think we’re still like that, do you? You're the fool if you can’t see how we’ve evolved.\nRINXO JABBERY: (OFF; GROWING FAINTER) And yet you continually fail to learn the lessons of your past. You lurch from one environmental calamity to another. Take the parlous situation on Satellite 16, for example... (VOICE FADES)\nLYSETTE: That’s odd.\nNYSSA: What is?\nLYSETTE: That bank of black cloud hanging over the green.\nNYSSA: It shouldn’t be there?\nLYSETTE: No.\nNYSSA: I see what you mean. It looks almost solid. Manufactured. Or am I being silly?\nLYSETTE: Oh well, I’m sure it’s just a glitch. Dobson will sort it out.\nLYSETTE: (BEAT; WRYLY) And hopefully before her ladyship concludes that\nLYSETTE: bad weather constitutes a breach of contract and decides to sue us. (LOUDLY, MOVING OFF) Now, if you’d care to move down here...\nCUT TO: ers\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 27\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE HUM, WHIRRING & QUIET BEEPING OF SOPHISTICATED FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY. )\nBARCLAY: Thanks, Dobson. Over and out. (FX: SWITCHES OFF COMMUNICATOR) Tech’s a bit busy at the moment. He’ll be here as soon as he can. So what do you think of our environment system, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Intriguing. I presume this is the climatic phasing adjunct to the main manipulator controls?\nBARCLAY: If you say so. I’m not a tech. You seem a bit of an expert, though.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I dabble — certainly enough to know that the technological expertise required to implement a phasing system of this complexity is.. well, frankly mind-boggling. The compatibility linkage alone is — are you sure you haven’t had help with this?\nBARCLAY: Help?\nDOCTOR: Alien help, Isaac. This is incredibly advanced technology.\nBARCLAY: This was all installed before I arrived.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Mind if I have a poke around inside, see what’s what? I might even be able to pinpoint the source of your cloud problem for you.\nBARCLAY: Better not. No disrespect, Doctor, but only an authorised tech is allowed to access the system. It’s a Trust directive.\nDOCTOR: Is it? Well, I hope your man arrives soon, or your summer season is likely to be a wash-out. In fact... yes, I do believe the first spots are already starting to fall.\nDOCTOR: 7\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 28\nBARCLAY: Look at those damn silly villagers, raising their hands to the skies, as if they’ve never seen rain before. Clones! I don’t know how... oh!\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nBARCLAY: Look outside.\nBARCLAY: In Creation’s name! They’re writhing, collapsing...\nBARCLAY: It must be something in the rain! It’s burning them like acid!\nDOCTOR: (APPALLED) But Nyssa and Lysette are out there!\nTHEME MUSIC: END OF PART ONE\nTHEME MUSIC: IR\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 29"

It’s a most —\nALEXIS LINFOOT: (SOURLY) You always have to play the martyr, don’t you, Vincent?\nVINCENT LINFOOT: Martyr? Well, no, I don’t think —\nALEXIS LINFOOT: My husband is here for a specific purpose — not that he would dream of mentioning it, of course.\nVINCENT LINFOOT: Actually I was just about to —\nALEXIS LINFOOT: He’s searching for genealogical evidence, and would therefore like some time to look around the churchyard. I trust that can be accommodated? Or do you intend to whisk us off elsewhere before we’ve barely had time to catch our breath?\nLYSETTE: No. I mean... yes, of course. Take all the time you need, Mr Linfoot.\nVINCENT LINFOOT: Thank you, my dear.\nNYSSA: So your family was originally from Stockbridge?\nVINCENT LINFOOT: Indeed, yes. I’ve traced my lineage back several hundred generations. It’s been a long-held ambition of mine to travel to the land of my forefathers.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: And don’t I know it! He’s prattled on about it for years. I only agreed to come to this god-forsaken hole in the hope it would shut him up.\nLYSETTE: Well, I hope you find what you’re looking for, Mr Linfoot. The oldest graves are the ones to the left there.\nLYSETTE: 24\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 37\nDOCTOR WHO: VINCENT LINFOOT. Thank you. Then that’s where I’1l1 start.\nNYSSA: Aren’t you joining your husband, Mrs Linfoot?\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Grub around in the dirt? Certainly not. I’m going to find somewhere cool and quiet to sit down.\nLYSETTE: Then I suggest we join Professor Jabbery inside the church. I think you’ll find the interior architecture extremely interesting. St Justinian’s dates back to the eleventh century, and many of the hand-carved pews —\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Save the lecture for someone who cares, child.

I’ve re-routed the electromagnetic resonance recorder, and fed it back through the atmospheric motion sensors.\nBARCLAY: Riiiight. (BEAT) And that does what exactly?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Imagine I hypnotised you into believing you were a\nDOCTOR: doctor. What might you do?\nBARCLAY: I don’t know. Behave like a doctor? Try to cure people?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nBARCLAY: (BEAT) Sorry, you’ve lost me.\nDOCTOR: (PATIENTLY) Put simply, I’ve convinced this weather machine of\nDOCTOR: yours that it’s a cellular analyser. So all I have to do is slot Mrs Sowerby’s saliva sample into here, and...\nBARCLAY: And what, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: And we wait patiently for the results.

Don’t you have a proper drink in that bag?\nLYSETTE: I’m afraid not. But we’ll be stopping for lunch at the Green Dragon in two hours. Traditional ‘pub grub’.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Hmpf. I’1l be dead of thirst by then.\nLYSETTE: (MOVING AWAY; UNDER HER BREATH) With any luck.\nNYSSA: (QUIETLY) The Doctor and I ordered food in the Green Dragon earlier. It wasn’t very pleasant.\nLYSETTE: You arrived in winter, didn’t you?\nNYSSA: Yes, why? Does it make a difference?\nLYSETTE: We’ve been having problems with the food preservation units. Dobson is constantly patching up the system, but it’s disintegrating, like everything else. The freezer vaults are okay, but as soon as the food is thawed out it goes off very quickly. If you don’t eat it within six hours it’s rotten. Dad thinks it’s something to do with the humidity (shields)-\nALEXIS LINFOOT: What is that?\nALEXIS LINFOOT: (FX: RAIN AGAINST THE WINDOW, LIGHT AT FIRST, BECOMING HEAVIER AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES )\nRINXO JABBERY: Evidence suggests unseasonal precipitation.\nRINXO JABBERY: AN\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 41\nALEXIS LINFOOT: What?\nLYSETTE: (RESIGNEDLY) It’s starting to rain, Mrs Linfoot.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: I know that! I mean why is it raining?\nNYSSA: Spring shower?\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Don’t be facetious, child. Rain only occurs in the autumn quarter. Sunshine is guaranteed during the exposed sections of the tour. Guaranteed. Do you understand what that means?\nNYSSA: Of course I do.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Oh, this really is the most shoddy-\nALEXIS LINFOOT: (FX: FROM OUTSIDE COME SCREAMS, RISING IN PITCH AS THE RAIN BECOMES HARDER)\nALEXIS LINFOOT: That’s my Vincent!\nLYSETTE: What’s happening?\nNYSSA: Let’s find out.\nNYSSA: (FX: F/G RAPID FOOTSTEPS ON STONE; B/G SCREAMS AND RAIN FROM OUTSIDE.

Don’t just stand there!\nLYSETTE: Of course, I-\nNYSSA: Lysette, don’t!\nLYSETTE: What?\nNYSSA: I think it’s the rain. It’s something in the rain.\nLYSETTE: But.. that’s impossible! The rain inside the Bubble is perfectly safe.\nRINXO JABBERY: Evidence would suggest otherwise.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: It’s nothing to do with the rain! It’s a seizure! A heart attack!\nNYSSA: I don’t think so.\nALEXIS LINFOOT: I don’t care what you think! My Vincent needs help. You, girl! It’s your duty to help him.\nLYSETTE: (UNCERTAINLY) I don’t-\nALEXIS LINFOOT: Now, child!\nNYSSA: No. Stay where you are, Lysette.\nRINXO JABBERY: Agreed.

How are our friends outside?\nBARCLAY: Persistent as ever, I’m afraid. Aha! I knew there’d be one about here somewhere.\nDOCTOR: One what?\nBARCLAY: Another environment suit. Should provide complete protection from the rain. Now, if only we had a phaser rifle, we’d be laughing.\nDOCTOR: (BREAKING OFF FROM HIS COMPUTER WORK, APPALLED) You’d be prepared to shoot down your fellow citizens in cold blood?\nBARCLAY: (DEFENSIVELY) Well... only if they attacked me first. And like you said, Doctor, they’re not really people any more, are they? Look at Mrs Sowerby. (FX: MRS SOWERBY SNARLS AND HISSES) Creation only knows what she’s become.\nDOCTOR: That’s hardly an excuse for murder.\nBARCLAY: (SHAME-FACEDLY) No, Doctor. You’re right. Whatever they are, I Suppose it’s not their fault. It’s just.. being stuck here, not knowing what’s happening to Lysette.\nDOCTOR: You’ve tried calling her again?\nBARCLAY: Aye. Dobson too. I can’t raise anybody.\nDOCTOR: Whoever the aliens are, they must be blocking the communications network. If that tech of yours — Dobson, was it? — turns up unprepared...\nDOCTOR: AA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 45\nBARCLAY: I know. It hardly bears thinking about.\nDOCTOR: Aha! The results. (BEAT; DISAPPOINTED) Oh.\nBARCLAY: What’s up?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes the available resources will only stretch so far.\nBARCLAY: You mean the analyser hasn’t worked?\nDOCTOR: No, no. It has — but only up to a point. These readings confirm that Mrs Sowerby’s body has been invaded by a sophisticated micro-organism.\nBARCLAY: ‘Organism’? What kind of organism?\nDOCTOR: The analyser isn’t sophisticated enough to tell me that. If I knew precisely what it was we were up against I’d be better equipped to deal with it.\nBARCLAY: You’d have more chance at the CES, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: CES?\nBARCLAY: Central Environment Station. It links all the local stations together. I’1ll tell you, Doctor, you’d be able to stop the rain from there, never mind analyse it.\nDOCTOR: And where exactly is the CES?\nBARCLAY: Middle of Wells Wood, about five miles away. But it might as well be on the moon, as far as we’re concerned.\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily. How far away would you say the visitors’ shuttle was, Isaac?\nDOCTOR: AS\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 46\nBARCLAY: From here? Hundred and fifty metres?\nDOCTOR: Hmm... Perhaps if I could manipulate the environmental conditions slightly — create a localized fog between here and the shuttle...\nBARCLAY: Oh, come on, Doctor! You’d never make it.\nDOCTOR: The comms unit in the shuttle is equipped for deep space communications, so it’1ll be fitted with what? A WN5 filtration booster?\nBARCLAY: Don’t be daft. That system went out with the Ark. It’s all WN9 now.\nDOCTOR: Even better. So it will have a far greater range than the local communicators. I could use it to break through the interference and contact Nyssa and Lysette. Then I could override the auto- pilot on the shuttle, fly it to the CES, switch off the rain, work out what we’re up against and come up with a way of fighting back.\nBARCLAY: Aye, you could do that. But I still say it’d be suicide going out there.\nBARCLAY: (ALARMED) What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m preparing to test the efficiency of this environment suit you just found. We can work out the finer details of the plan while I get ready. Now, where does this bit go, d’you suppose?\nDOCTOR: AA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 47\nDOCTOR WHO: 20a. INT.

Mrs Linfoot has expressed repugnance at all previous instances of physical contact between us.\nNYSSA: You’d better lay her down on the flagstones.

As soon as the temperature gauge reaches critical, the safety cut-off will activate, and the fog will disperse quickly.\nBARCLAY: As long as it lasts long enough for you to reach that shuttle.

The Dalek came from somewhere. It wasn’t just hiding down there, ready to attack us. I’m hoping we’1l find a network of tunnels, leading to different parts of the village.\nLYSETTE: (LV) And what if we don’t? What if that tunnel just leads us straight into the Dalek’s.. larder, or something.\nNYSSA: (LV) Daleks don’t have larders. At least, I don’t think they do. Now come on, or we’ll miss our chance!\nNYSSA: TA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 77\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: RAIN HAMMERING ON PLASTIC; RAIN HISSING IN THE UNDERGROWTH )\nBARCLAY: (DISTORTED; URGENT) Doctor! Doctor, will you come in please!\nBARCLAY: (D) Doctor, are you there? Speak to me!\nDOCTOR: (WEAK; PAINED) I’m here, Isaac.\nBARCLAY: (D) Doctor! Thank Creation! Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) Let’s see... Touch of concussion; bumps and bruises; no broken bones. But the shuttle’s damaged. The rain’s been coming in while I’ve been unconscious... (HISSES IN PAIN)\nBARCLAY: (D; HORRIFIED) Don’t tell me you got some on your skin?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. I really should have kept those gloves on. (PAIN) I can already feel the organisms burrowing... working their way into my system.\nBARCLAY: (D; HOPEFUL) Well... maybe if it’s just your hand, it won’t be so bad.\nDOCTOR: I must go. Get to the CES before... well, before the situation deteriorates.\nBARCLAY: (D) Can you still remember the keypad entry number? It’s seven\nBARCLAY: seven —\nDOCTOR: 7721. I know.\nDOCTOR: T7\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 78\nBARCLAY: (D) What about the sample from Mrs Sowerby? It wasn’t damaged in the crash?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s still here. Safe and sound. Right, gloves back on. Now, where’s the helmet? Ah!\nBARCLAY: (D) All right. Well... just be careful, Doctor. You don’t know what you might be facing out there.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I expect I’ll be facing what I always face, Isaac — trouble. (HE SLOTS THE HELMET INTO PLACE. MUFFLED) I’11 see you\nDOCTOR: later.\nCUT TO: DALEK 3\nCUT TO: Avian observation units reduced to 43 per cent efficiency after\nCUT TO: destruction of airborne craft.\nCUT TO: DALEK 2 What is the status of the Doctor?\nCUT TO: DALEK 3 Remaining units report that the Doctor has survived, and is now\nCUT TO: approaching Zone Zero.\nCUT TO: DALEK 3 Shall I order remaining observation units to intercept?\nCUT TO: DALEK 2 Affirmative.\nCUT TO: 72\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 719\nDOCTOR WHO: (DRIP OF WATER; NYSSA AND LYSETTE’S VOICES ECHO; THEY ARE BOTH BREATHLESS; WE HEAR THEIR EXHAUSTED FOOTSTEPS ON THE TUNNEL’S FLAGSTONE FLOOR; THEY COME TO A STOP)\nLYSETTE: Need... to rest.\nNYSSA: I’m not sure that’s a good idea.\nLYSETTE: Why? The Dalek didn’t see us come down here.\nNYSSA: That doesn’t mean it won’t be behind us. What do you suppose it will do when it realizes we didn’t run out into the rain?\nLYSETTE: Return to base?\nNYSSA: Precisely. (WITH A SIGH) I’m beginning to think that maybe you were right.\nLYSETTE: About what?\nNYSSA: About this tunnel leading in only one direction.\nLYSETTE: Oh no. Please don’t say that now. You don’t really think we’ve trapped ourselves?\nNYSSA: This was always a gamble.\nLYSETTE: But maybe we just need to go a bit further.\nNYSSA: We’ve been walking for fifteen minutes now, and we haven’t come across so much as a ventilation shaft so far.\nLYSETTE: (SUDDENLY ANGRY) But that doesn’t mean we should just give up, does it? What are you suggesting? That we sit here and wait for the Dalek to catch up with us?\nLYSETTE: 710\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 80\nNYSSA: Of course not. I’m just facing reality.\nLYSETTE: Yeah, well, I’m not. I can’t do that. I can’t not believe that everything will be all right. I keep thinking about my father.\nLYSETTE: About what might be happening to him and I... I... (HER VOICE BREAKS; SHE IS TRYING TO HOLD BACK TEARS)\nNYSSA: You’re right, of course. We’re not beaten yet. I’ve been in\nNYSSA: more perilous situations than this, and survived.\nLYSETTE: Have you really?\nNYSSA: Well... almost as perilous. Let’s carry on.\nNYSSA: (FX: RAIN HISSING IN WET UNDERGROWTH. THE DOCTOR IS STAGGERING, BREATHING HOARSELY INSIDE HIS HELMET.

NYSSA SUDDENLY STOPS, FOLLOWED BY LYSETTE )\nNYSSA: There’s something ahead.\nLYSETTE: (HUSHED) A Dalek?\nNYSSA: If it was a Dalek, we’d be dead by now. Let me have your torch for a moment. (BEAT) It’s a door.\nLYSETTE: (DESPAIRINGLY) Oh, Creation. A dead end.\nNYSSA: A door is not a dead end.\nNYSSA: (FX: NYSSA TAKES THE TORCH AND APPROACHES, FOOTSTEPS CRACKLING ON THE WET, GRITTY FLOOR)\nLYSETTE: It is if there’s something nasty on the other side. Like a Dalek.\nNYSSA: Lysette, we won’t increase our chances of survival by refusing to take risks.\nNYSSA: Interesting... There’s no handle, no sensor pad, nothing. It’s just smooth metal.\nLYSETTE: (BLEAKLY) So that’s it then.\nNYSSA: (REFUSING TO GIVE UP) Just hold the torch, would you? Point it at the edge of the door there.\nLYSETTE: What for?\nNYSSA: (STRAINING TO OPEN THE DOOR) I’m going to see if I can open it manually.\nNYSSA: RQ9\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 83\nLYSETTE: You won’t be able to.\nNYSSA: (FLASH OF IRRITATION) Stop being so defeatist, Lysette! Just... hold the torch, will you? I think it’s beginning to shift.\nLYSETTE: Hey, look! You’ve opened it a crack!\nNYSSA: Give me a hand.\nNYSSA: (FX: BOTH GIRLS STRUGGLE WITH THE DOOR, PULLING IT BACK INCH BY INCH. FAINTLY WE HEAR THE DALEK BASE SOUNDS)\nLYSETTE: (PANTING A LITTLE; HUSHED) What’s that noise?\nNYSSA: It’s the sound of Dalek machinery.\nLYSETTE: Oh Creation. So this is the way to the larder, after all.\nNYSSA: (FINAL HEAVE) That should do it. We can squeeze through there.\nLYSETTE: Are you serious?\nNYSSA: Where else can we go?\nLYSETTE: It’s probably a trap. Why wasn’t it locked?\nNYSSA: Perhaps the Daleks weren’t expecting visitors. Or maybe they haven’t got enough power for non-essential systems... Yes, that might be it.\nLYSETTE: What do you mean?\nNYSSA: Remember how battered and dusty that Dalek was? My guess is that they’ve been waiting down here for centuries, in a state of suspended animation. Perhaps they’re only just coming back to life.\nNYSSA: RQ\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 84\nLYSETTE: You keep saying ‘they’. How do you know there’s more than one of them?\nNYSSA: Daleks don’t usually travel alone.\nLYSETTE: (IRONICALLY) Oh, this just gets better. So why do you think they’re waking up now?\nNYSSA: (SUDDEN REALISATION) The Doctor!\nLYSETTE: What?\nNYSSA: They must have realised that the Doctor keeps returning to Stockbridge. And so they set a trap for him. Waited here, like Spiders in a web.\nLYSETTE: (CONFUSED) They did all this for the Doctor?\nNYSSA: I’m only guessing, but... it would make sense.\nLYSETTE: But why are they so interested in him?\nNYSSA: The Doctor and the Daleks go back a long way.\nLYSETTE: (SIGHS) I’m sorry, I’m a bit lost. So you and the Doctor aren’t with the Trust, then?\nNYSSA: No. Sorry.\nLYSETTE: So why did you come?\nNYSSA: It’s a long story — and a fairly complicated one at that. We’re not here by choice.\nLYSETTE: Well, if you don’t want to tell me...\nLYSETTE: RA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 85\nNYSSA: No, it’s not that. It’s just.. Look, we really don’t have the time to discuss it now.\nLYSETTE: Okay. (BEAT) Do you really think going in there is our only option?\nNYSSA: I’m afraid so. But view this as an opportunity. There’s a greater chance that we’ll be able to do more damage to the Daleks here. Strike at their heart.\nLYSETTE: And there’s a greater chance that we’ll get blasted to smithereens.\nNYSSA: True. But as the Doctor might say, it’s precisely those kinds of possibilities that make life so interesting.\nNYSSA: (FX: A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERIC FROM THE STATION WITH BARCLAY IN.

How did they get it all down here?\nNYSSA: (LV) I don’t know. But I was right about it being here for centuries. Look at the dust.\nLYSETTE: (LV) Maybe all the other Daleks are dead. Maybe the one that we saw is the only one that’s (survived)-\nLYSETTE: DALEK 2 (OFF) Conditioned humans have gained access to Zone Zero.

I’m not proposing a gun battle.\nLYSETTE: (NERVOUS LAUGH; LV) That’s a relief.\nNYSSA: (LV) Let’s try through here...\nNYSSA: Q1\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 92\nDOCTOR WHO: 44. DALEK BASE — CRYO CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ECHO HOLLOWLY, SUGGESTING THEY HAVE ENTERED A CATHEDRAL-LIKE SPACE. THEY WALK SLOWLY INSIDE.)\nLYSETTE: Creation! This is huge! Where are we?\nNYSSA: Judging by this equipment, inside a life-support unit of some kind. These look like cryogenic suspension chambers and that —\nLYSETTE: (HORRIFIED SURPRISE) Look out! Daleks!\nNYSSA: (TENTATIVELY) It’s all right. I think they’re inactive.\nLYSETTE: Be careful, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Don’t worry. If they were aware of me, I’d be dead by now. I wonder...\nNYSSA: I thought so. Look at these readings.\nLYSETTE: Sorry, it’s all gobbledegook to me. What am I looking at?\nNYSSA: Well, assuming that these six columns relate to the cryo- chambers here... it appears that three of the Daleks were revived and three perished.\nLYSETTE: That one looks as though it exploded. What’s all that icky green stuff?\nNYSSA: The remains of the Dalek creature inside the casing.\nLYSETTE: Nice. What do you think killed the other two?\nLYSETTE: Qn\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 93\nNYSSA: If I’m reading this data correctly, they’ve been here for over seventeen centuries. Simple mechanical failure, perhaps? That might account for the deaths. It’s a credit to Dalek technology that three of the cryo-units have remained functional for so long.\nLYSETTE: Six Daleks minus three dead Daleks equals three active Daleks. Yes? Well, that’s not so bad, is it?\nNYSSA: Don’t let their lack of numbers lull you into a false sense of security. One Dalek would be more than capable of wiping out Stockbridge and everyone living here.\nLYSETTE: (DEFLATED) Well that’s it then. There’s nothing we can do.\nNYSSA: We can arm ourselves — with knowledge. The Doctor often says that information is the best weapon. (FX: NYSSA PUSHES SOME MORE BUTTONS ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY) Information like...\nLYSETTE: What is it? A schematic of the Dalek base?\nNYSSA: Yes, but look at the amount of damage caused by geological movement. The metal shell is riven with cracks and stresses.\nLYSETTE: You mean it could collapse at any moment?\nNYSSA: Well, certainly within another couple of centuries.\nLYSETTE: (LAUGHS BLEAKLY) I’m not sure we can wait that long.\nNYSSA: No. But perhaps we could give nature a helping hand.\nLYSETTE: (EXCITED) You think we could? How?\nNYSSA: According to this, the Daleks have created an electronic master link from this base to the main environment manipulator, which controls your weather.\nNYSSA: Q2\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 94\nLYSETTE: The manipulator? But that’s where the Doctor was!\nNYSSA: Exactly. He must have had the same idea: control the environment and you control Stockbridge. Except I doubt he knows anything about this master link. He was probably trying to stop the rain.\nLYSETTE: Good for him. But what are we going to use the environment manipulator for?\nNYSSA: Seismology. If we could access to the seismological controls we could create an earthquake severe enough to tear this place apart.\nLYSETTE: Sounds like a plan. So where is this master link?\nNYSSA: That’s the problem. According to the schematic here, it’s in the main control room — where the Daleks are.\nLYSETTE: So, let’s draw the Daleks out.\nNYSSA: Good idea. But how?\nLYSETTE: What’s that? Have they found us?\nNYSSA: I don’t think so. According to the schematic both Daleks are still in the main control room. Wait a minute: there are three there now.\nLYSETTE: What’s that red blob with them? A fourth Dalek?\nNYSSA: (WITH DREAD) No. A Time Lord.\nCUT TO: OA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 95\nDOCTOR: (FX: WALKING IN) Lovely place you’ve got here. Charming décor. What do you call it? Subterranean minimalism? Caveman chic?\nDOCTOR: DALEK 1 (FX: GLIDING IN BEHIND) Silence!\nDOCTOR: Or what? You’1ll exterminate me? But you’d have done that by now if you were going to. Which means you need me for something.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 1 Silence!\nDOCTOR: Don’t like feeling helpless, do you, Dalek? Don’t like having to constrain that itchy trigger-tentacle of yours. Because at the end of the day that’s all you really are. A gun. Without\nDOCTOR: that you’re nothing.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 (FX: GLIDING FORWARD) You cannot provoke the Daleks!\nDOCTOR: Really? (BEAT) So this is Central Control, is it? It’s a bit dingy, even by your standards. Did someone not pay the electricity bill?\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Diverting energy to non-essential systems is unnecessary.\nDOCTOR: You mean you’re low on power. My word, you are a wretched bunch. I almost feel sorry for you. Forgotten, abandoned, skulking in the dark...\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 We have not been abandoned. Soon we will return in triumph to the Dalek fleet —\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3 . with you as our prisoner!\nDOCTOR: You have been asleep for a long time, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Explain!\nDOCTOR: O4\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 96\nDOCTOR: Your race is long gone. You were driven from this sector of the galaxy centuries ago. Where there used to be a glorious Dalek Empire, there’s now just a big, empty nothing.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 You lie!\nDOCTOR: Do I? If you don’t believe me, why not try opening a communications channel to that fleet of yours? After all, I’m sure you’re dying to have a good boast about the success of your brilliant plan.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 (BEAT; HATES ACTING ON THE DOCTOR’S SUGGESTION, BUT NEEDS TO KNOW) Open a channel to Dalek Command.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3 Earth Mission to Dalek Command.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3 Earth Mission to Dalek Command. (BEAT) Answer! Answer!\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST SADLY) You see? The time of the Daleks is long gone.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Nothing can defeat the might of the Dalek Empire.\nDOCTOR: The combined forces of over one hundred planets can — and did. (VOICE HARDENS) Face it, Daleks. You’re obsolete. You’re like — (SUDDENLY HE HISSES IN PAIN FROM HIS HAND) .. like soldiers in the Far East who think the War’s still going on...\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 This.. changes nothing. Despite your resistance, your Time Lord physiology continues to undergo cellular subjugation.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3\nDOCTOR: Soon, you will succumb to superior Dalek conditioning and become our willing servant. With your help, the Daleks will conquer time and space!\nDOCTOR: QA\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 97\nDOCTOR: (PANTING AS HE RECOVERS) Well, I’m flattered by your faith in my abilities, but I’m not sure even I can resurrect the dead. DALEK 2\nDOCTOR: It is time to reveal the contents of the stasis vault. Activate release mechanism.\nDOCTOR: (FX: MORE BLIPS AND BLEEPS; A MEATY ‘CHUNK’, LIKE A LOCK DISENGAGING )\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3 Release mechanism activated.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Open the vault.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Behold the means of our resurrection, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (HORRIFIED) Oh no. (BEAT) It’s my TARDIS!\nCUT TO: Q7\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 98\nLYSETTE: Look, shouldn’t we be trying to rescue the Doctor?\nNYSSA: I’m sure he’s doing very well on his own. Besides, if this works, it should take care of at least one Dalek. And who knows? It might just give the Doctor time to... well, it might give him time.\nLYSETTE: But are you sure it’1ll work, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: I’m not sure of anything. But nothing ventured, nothing gained. Are you sure you know how to operate the Dalek gun?\nLYSETTE: It seems pretty straight-forward. It’s just point and shoot.\nNYSSA: Yes, one thing about the Daleks is that they do tend to create weapons of devastating simplicity.\nNYSSA: (FX: BLIPS AND BLEEPS; NYSSA PRESSING BUTTONS, MANIPULATING CONTROLS )\nLYSETTE: Don’t worry. I’1ll try not to blow myself up like the previous owner of the gun. I may not be green, but I’m sure it’d be just as messy.\nNYSSA: There, finished. I’ve overloaded the diothermic regulator and disabled the safety cut-out.

Maybe they’1l send another one to investigate. We could just wait here and pick them off.\nNYSSA: They won’t make the same mistake twice. If we don’t get out now, they’re more likely to seal us in and leave us to burn.\nLYSETTE: So what’s our next move?\nNYSSA: We go on the attack. Take the battle to them.\nLYSETTE: (HOLLOW LAUGH) I thought you said you didn’t want a gun fight?\nNYSSA: I don’t. But at least the odds are even now. Two of them, two\nNYSSA: of us. The same weapons. Plus we’ve got an advantage.\nLYSETTE: We make smaller targets than they do?\nNYSSA: No: the Doctor.\nNYSSA: 1N0N\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 101\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEK 3\nDOCTOR WHO: Dalek unit ambushed and exterminated.

I thought you’d had it!\nDOCTOR: Me? Had it? Never! Ah, Isaac, forgive my asking but what were you doing behind that work bench?\nBARCLAY: It was that... awful noise.\nDOCTOR: Awful noise? (FX: PATS TARDIS) Don’t listen to him, old thing.\nBARCLAY: Where in Creation did that that come from?\nDOCTOR: This is the TARDIS. My ship.\nBARCLAY: (ASTONISHED) Your ship? But it’s an old box.\nDOCTOR: Appearances can be deceptive. (BEAT) So, Isaac, what brings you to the CES?\nBARCLAY: The rain stopped, so I thought it was safe to come looking for you. To see if you were all right.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m fine, Isaac. Ticketty boo. You managed to evade the villagers then? You must run pretty fast.\nBARCLAY: It wasn’t exactly hard. The villagers are dying, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 109\nDOCTOR: (SOMBRE) Dying? Are you sure?\nBARCLAY: Aye. After the rain stopped, there was this.. mist. Like a sea- mist. Just rolled in out of nowhere. The villagers started choking and collapsing. I managed to get to Dobson’s skimmer and drove over here. I knew you’d arrived at the CES earlier, and that you were affected by the rain, and I just thought... well, I hoped I could help.\nDOCTOR: And you weren’t worried that the mist would affect you in the same way it did the villagers? You’re not wearing an environmental protection suit, I see.\nBARCLAY: No. Well... I’m not one of them, am I?\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) No, you’re not.\nBARCLAY: So! You’re all right, then? Not... infected, like?\nDOCTOR: Not any more. And never as much as the Daleks thought. It was touch and go in there for a while, but once I got the measure of the infection attacking my mind, I was able to keep it at bay.\nBARCLAY: Mind over matter, eh?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nBARCLAY: And what about now?\nDOCTOR: The Dalek cells are dying. I’m becoming me again. You see, what the Daleks didn’t know was that before they captured me I used some of my own blood to develop a retrovirus, which I released into the atmosphere.\nBARCLAY: A retrovirus?\nBARCLAY: 1NQ\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 110\nDOCTOR: One that attacks the alien DNA, causing it to break down at an astonishing rate. (SADLY) I was rather hoping the villagers would recover once the invading organisms started to die off, but it seems they were too weak. That’s nth generation clones for you.\nBARCLAY: So what happens now?\nDOCTOR: Well, I rather think that depends on you, doesn’t it?\nBARCLAY: Me?\nDOCTOR: Yes. After all, like Lysette, you are a Dalek servitor. My suspicion was confirmed as soon as I mentioned the Daleks by name, and you didn’t respond. I assume you were sent here to disperse the retrovirus?\nBARCLAY: Move away from the TARDIS doors, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Or you’1ll what? Zap me to death with that thing? I would have thought the Daleks would have given you a proper gun, something you could wave about with authority.\nBARCLAY: This is an electrostatic induction rod, Doctor. It carries a three million volt charge hot enough to fuse sand into glass.\nDOCTOR: I know what it is. I put it there earlier. I’d just popped back to pick it up, as a matter of fact. (DESPERATELY) Listen, Isaac. You can fight against the servitor implant. You must! Don’t you want to be a free man again? Don’t you want to think for yourself?\nBARCLAY: Independent thought is irrelevant. I serve the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: And you’re helping them to do what? Destroy your home? Kill your friends? Can’t you see they’re using you? You and Lysette.\nBARCLAY: (UNCERTAINLY) Our lives are... unimportant.\nBARCLAY: 119\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 111\nDOCTOR: That’s what that hateful little voice in your head tells you, doesn’t it? But it’s not true, Isaac. You are important. You saved my life, before the Daleks activated that implant in your cranium. You’re a good man, a brave man.\nBARCLAY: (STUGGLING) Goodness is... unnecessary. Bravery is...\nDOCTOR: You love Lysette, don’t you? All those years you’ve cared for her, looked after her.\nBARCLAY: (CONFUSED) I... I.. Lysette...\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) Tell me why you came here, Issac. To Stockbridge. Tell me about your wife. Lysette’s mother. Why isn’t she here with you? What happened to her?\nBARCLAY: (QUIETLY) We lived in one of the townships on Satellite 16 in the Hammer Nebula. I was a maintenance operative in a munitions plant. But I was off sick. Long term. Nerve damage. Waiting in the queue for medical treatment we couldn’t afford. Miri... my wife.. had to work double shifts at the Citizenship Bureau. Fifteen hours a day, six days a week. One night, she was waiting at the station for the last shuttle home, when... (TAILS OFF )\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) Go on.\nBARCLAY: She was attacked... robbed. There were six of them. They threw her onto the tracks. Then the shuttle came.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. You came here for a better life, with no idea that this idyllic place, this noble human endeavour, was a trap, underpinned by Dalek technology. The environment station, the stasis bubble, the cloning — all of that is well beyond this time period’s technical capabilities.\nBARCLAY: I never was much cop at science.\nDOCTOR: It was the technology which allowed the Daleks to control you. The first time you and Lysette cloned yourselves —\nDOCTOR: 111\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 112\nBARCLAY: Renewed ourselves, Doctor. We’re not clones like the rest. There’s a rejuvenation chamber on one of the hidden levels of this building. Secret government project. It was a stipulation of the contract. Every five years we underwent cell renewal. We were told to record the results...\nDOCTOR: Only it wasn’t a secret government project at all, was it? It was a way of establishing a link with the dormant Dalek consciousness. A way of making you their servitors.. their slaves.\nBARCLAY: (STRUGGLING FOR DOMINANCE; DALEK CONSCIOUSNESS RE-ESTABLISHING ITSELF) We are.. not slaves. It is.. an honour to serve the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Fight it, Isaac. Think of Lysette. Think of Miri, of how she died. Because that’s what the Daleks do. They assault you without pity to get what they want. They rob you of hope. They wipe out love as if it were nothing.\nBARCLAY: (STRUGGLING; ANGUISHED) I... I..can’t...\nDOCTOR: You can, Isaac. Fight them. Drive them out.\nBARCLAY: (STILL STRUGGLING) No, I.. I don’t... please, I... (SUDDENLY STRIDENT; SHRIEKING) The Daleks are supreme! You must obey!

To put it simply, I let a little of the outside in.\nBARCLAY: Are you going to destroy me?\nDOCTOR: I’m not a Dalek. And neither are you. I think it might be best if you were to come with me.\nBARCLAY: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: Oddly enough, we’re going where you would have taken me.

But of course you wouldn’t understand that.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Your compassion is a weakness. It will prove to be your downfall.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. But not today. You’re all alone, Dalek. Your comrades are dead, your plans are in ruins. I’m here to offer you a deal. Let my friends go and I’1l1 let you live.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 You would allow a Dalek to live?\nDOCTOR: Why not? You can’t go anywhere. There’s no-one left to kill.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 I will kill your friends if you do not obey me, Doctor.\nBARCLAY: Not if I kill you first.\nDOCTOR: Isaac, no. This isn’t the way.\nBARCLAY: But this thing deserves to die! Look what it did to me, to Lysette, to Stockbridge.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know. Please. Give me the induction rod. (BARCLAY DOES SO) Thank you.\nBARCLAY: I’m useless. I had a chance to kill it and I failed.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t fail.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2\nDOCTOR: Incorrect. Servitor Isaac Barclay did fail.

Now I will complete my mission. Using your TARDIS we will travel back to the dawn of the Dalek Empire. With your knowledge the Daleks will conquer all of time and space. Refusal to comply will result in the destruction of the female humanoids.\nNYSSA: Well, that’s no choice, is it? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Quite right, Nyssa. No choice at all.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor! You can’t help the Daleks!\nDOCTOR: Who said anything about helping them? This thing might not be powerful enough to penetrate Dalekanium, but it will make a lovely big hole in the ceiling!\nDOCTOR: (FX: A BLAST OF POWER FROM THE INDUCTION ROD SMASHES A HOLE THROUGH METAL, ROCK AND EARTH, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SURFACE. RUBBLE AND DEBRIS CASCADE DOWN, CLANGING OFF THE DALEK’S METAL SHELL. THE DOCTOR AND NYSSA COUGH AND SPLUTTER)\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (COUGHING) I’m all right! Did it work?\nNYSSA: DALEK 2\nNYSSA: (AS THE DUST CLEARS) Your action was futile, Doctor. Damage is neg...gl..gl..gl.. (SUDDENLY STRANGLED; PANICKY) Alert! Alert! Retrovirus detect- detect- detected!\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter? Fog in your throat?\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 What... have you... done... to me?\nDOCTOR: 114\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 117\nDOCTOR: Given you a taste of your own medicine. What happened to those villagers is now happening to you.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Cellular disruption... increasing. Expiration... inevitable. You have... destroyed me... Doc...tor...\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, but you gave me no choice.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 2 Extermin(ate) !\nNYSSA: (SCREAMS) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Lysette. Nice to see you up and about again.\nLYSETTE: (SHELL-SHOCKED) It.. killed my... (THEN THE EMOTION COMES FLOODING OUT) Dad! Oh, Dad! Dad, no! (BURSTS INTO TEARS)\nDOCTOR: One thing that Daleks will never understand. Emotional ties.\nDOCTOR: I’m so sorry, Lysette.\nNYSSA: Doctor... will you get me out of here?\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, sorry.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BLEEPS AND BLIPS, AND A BRIEF ‘SUCTION’ SOUND, LIKE POWERFUL ENERGY BEING WITHDRAWN)\nNYSSA: Thank you. (GOING OVER TO LYSETTE) Lysette, I’m so sorry about your father. He was a brave man, a —\nLYSETTE: Stand back. Both of you.\nNYSSA: Lysette?\nNYSSA: 117\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 118\nLYSETTE: Stand back or I’1l shoot.\nDOCTOR: Lysette. The Daleks are dead, you don’t have to obey them anymore.\nLYSETTE: They might be dead, Doctor, but that disgusting thing in my head isn’t. Even now I can feel it scrabbling inside my consciousness. Trying to regain control.\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nLYSETTE: Using the master link to set the environment manipulator to critical, causing the protective bubble over Stockbridge to disintegrate. Forget about earthquakes, Nyssa, this should be much more spectacular!\nDOCTOR: This is madness, Lysette. Come with us!\nLYSETTE: And leave all this for another generation to stumble upon? No! It has to be annihilated, erased from history! Now go, both of you!\nNYSSA: We’re not leaving you!\nLYSETTE: Yes. You are. The Daleks have destroyed everything I ever cared about, Nyssa. And I’ve still got their instincts inside me. The urge to hate and conquer and kill. This is the only way to eliminate all evidence of them.\nNYSSA: But we can help you!\nLYSETTE: (SHOUTING; RANTY; DALEKY) No, you cannot! (STRUGGLING TO CALM DOWN) Even now I’m fighting the impulse not to pull this trigger. And I can barely suppress the... hatred for him. The Doctor. The ultimate enemy of the... (CHOKES OFF; INNER TURMOIL)\nLYSETTE: 118\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 119\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing we can do, Nyssa. We have to go. Now!\nNYSSA: (APPALLED) We can’t just leave her like this.\nLYSETTE: You must!\nNYSSA: (DESPERATE) But-\nLYSETTE: (FURIOUS) Go! Go! Or you will be... extermin-\nLYSETTE: (FX: MASSIVE CRASHING AND RUMBLING AS MAJOR DEBRIS STARTS TO FALL. IT FALLS ON LYSETTE, KILLING HER. NYSSA SCRABBLES OVER TO TRY AND SHIFT THE RUBBLE FROM LYSETTE’S CORPSE)\nNYSSA: Lysette! Lysette!\nDOCTOR: She’s gone, I’m afraid.\nNYSSA: (CLOSE TO TEARS) She was the last of them. The last of Stockbridge.\nNYSSA: (FX: CRITICAL IMPLOSION IS IMMINENT. THE MACHINES ARE GOING HAYWIRE. MORE EXPLOSIONS. MORE DEBRIS)\nDOCTOR: Come on, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (CHOKING) I can’t see you, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’m here. Take my hand.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CRASHING AND RUMBLING CONTINUES; SLAM OF THE TARDIS DOOR; DEMATERIALISATION. ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION FADING AWAY INTO NOTHING)\nDOCTOR: 1190\nDOCTOR WHO: PLAGUE OF THE DALEKS by Mark Morris 120\nDOCTOR: It’s gone... swept away. All those lives. All that history...\nNYSSA: I’m so sorry, Doctor. I know what it’s like to see somewhere you love destroyed.\nDOCTOR: But it was my fault. If I hadn’t been there...\nNYSSA: We were cast adrift in time, remember? We didn’t choose to be here, now.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. I should have realised, Nyssa. We were travelling forward in time, when the time bubble was created. And so when it collapsed, Time found a place for us at the last possible point in Stockbridge’s future. Its destruction.\nNYSSA: Remember what you’re always telling me? That history is written. Events are determined. You mustn’t blame yourself.\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn, Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn; Amidst thy bowers the tyrant’s hand is seen,\nDOCTOR: And Desolation saddens all thy green.\nNYSSA: That poem again. (BEAT) What is it?\nDOCTOR: Oliver Goldsmith. ‘The Deserted Village’. (FX: PRESSING CONSOLE BUTTONS) (BLEAKLY) Let’s go, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: To happier times and places?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) Happier times and places.\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR: 231163-15 19n"
