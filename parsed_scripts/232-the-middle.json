My love, I’m afraid there’s no such thing as a Saw-End Duck or a Great Marmaduke Tree. I hope you’re not too disappointed, but I rather enjoyed inventing them. And you did smile.",

You’d be too big for it now, little pickle, but back then you’d point at everything and want to know what it was - and I could tell you what almost everything was. But sometimes you’d point at a bird or a tree, and you’d want to know what type of a bird or a tree it was - and I wouldn’t know the answer. So I’d make it up! My love, I’m afraid there’s no such thing as a Saw-End Duck or a Great Marmaduke Tree. I hope you’re not too disappointed, but I rather enjoyed inventing them. And you did smile.\nBEAT: — FILLED BY FX: HEART MONITOR.\nJANAIYA: I don’t want any of you to worry. I know you will, but you shouldn’t. I’m going to be alright - I’1l be with your father soon. I’ve missed him a lot, you know. Maybe I’m looking forward to this, in a funny sort of way. But I’m going to miss you all dearly.\nJANAIYA: I can feel it coming now. Chloe, tell Sophie I love her - I know she’1l be too young to understand, but do tell her.\nCOMPUTER: Ten, nine, eight, seven -\nJANAIYA: (PANICKED) Oh no, please, can I have a little more time?\nCOMPUTER: Six, five, four -\nJANAIYA: (HURRIED) I love you, my darlings, I love you so much.\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 4\nCOMPUTER: Three, two, one.\nJANAIYA: (DEEP BREATH) Goodbye.\nCOMPUTER: Zero. Happy birthday, and welcome to the End.\nCOMPUTER: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 5\nCOMPUTER: SCENE 2: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOOR: OPENS AND FLIP FOLLOWS CONSTANCE IN.\nFLIP: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Connie, happy -\nCONSTANCE: Yes, that’s quite enough of that, thank you.\nFLIP: I can’t believe you weren’t going to tell me. That’s well sneaky, that is.\nCONSTANCE: I prefer not to make a fuss about it, and I don’t expect today to be any different.\nFLIP: So come on, Con — how old are you, exactly?\nDOCTOR: (AT CONTROLS) Mrs Ramon! A lady should not be required to disclose her age.\nCONSTANCE: I see we’ve landed. I think some fresh air may be in order?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it’ll be quite fresh, Mrs Clarke. I’m detecting a heavily recycled atmosphere. But it apppears they’ve added a little bit of flavouring — rather like lemon sherbert — so it should be quite tolerable.\nCONSTANCE: Let’s head out, then. Please.\nFLIP: For she’s a jolly good fellow, for she’s a jolly good fellow, for she’s a jolly good fe-e-llow -\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 6\nFLIP: SCENE 3: EXT. ROOFTOP [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Now that is quite a view. “Jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops” — as a predecessor of mine once said.\nCONSTANCE: Your predecessor was Shakespeare?\nDOCTOR: Well, no, but he did think rather highly of himself.\nDOCTOR: BY, DRONES FLYING BY.\nFLIP: Oooo — flying stuff!\nDOCTOR: What do you think? Busy city, technologically quite advanced... I’d say an Earth colony, judging by the architecture.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor. You can’t possibly know that at a glance.\nFLIP: I dunno - he is a bit of an Earth Spotter, isn’t he, our Doctor? With his pocket guide to human stuff and his little pencil to circle what he sees.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Flip. I like to call it using my eyes. And I also spy what looks like the limestone roof of a cavern up through the clouds.\nFLIP: Roof?!\nDOCTOR: Somewhere subterranean, with its own eco-system. Impressive.\nCONSTANCE: Like the inside of a stone snowglobe. I’m suddenly feeling slightly claustrophobic.\nFLIP: Why, does it come on with old age?\nCONSTANCE: (NOT TOO ANNOYED) Oh, for goodness’ sake...\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 7\nFLIP: Come on, no secrets, not between us. I’m nineteen, he’s nine- hundred-and-whatever-he-says-today, and you are...?\nCONSTANCE: (SIGH) Thirty-five. I am thirty-five.\nFLIP: Aha!\nCONSTANCE: Now, can we leave it at that?\nFLIP: Doctor, this had better be Planet Ibiza, or something - cus I’ve got a Wren Party to organise!\nFLIP: INSTRUMENTS.\nCONSTANCE: I do hope we can find something better to do. Even a spot of deadly peril would be fine.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m sure some deadly peril will be along in due course, Mrs Clarke. But you may be in luck, Flip — it looks like they’re having some kind of carnival down below...\nFLIP: (PEERS) That should do the trick.\nDOCTOR: I must say, I’m far more curious about that glass structure beyond the square...\nCONSTANCE: Quite magnificent, isn’t it?\nFLIP: (WORLD OF HER OWN) I could get masks made. — Cardboard masks with your face on, Connie.\nCONSTANCE: Why on Earth would you want to do that?\nDOCTOR: If my calculations are correct, that glass spire stands at the dead centre of the city — a column protruding from street level right the way to the roof of the cavern.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 8\nCONSTANCE: The whole thing’s revolving — it’s beautiful, the way it catches the light. Speaking of which — if we’re underground, why is it daylight?\nDOCTOR: Heavy duty floodlights, I’d say. We’re in the middle of a technological marvel.\nFLIP: In that case, there’s got to be somewhere round here I can get some T-shirts made. Who fancies a trot down a fire escape? (AS\nSHE: DISAPPEARS OFF) WREN PARTY!\nCONSTANCE: I really don’t want all this fuss.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure you’ve much choice in the matter. Come along, Mrs Clarke.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE\nCOMPUTER: Happy birthday!\nUSE: ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU’ — IN COPYRIGHT. ]\nYORK: Oh good grief...\nCOMPUTER: Welcome to your desktop. Congratulations on reaching your sixty-first year, Mr York.\nYORK: (HUSHED) Look, I’d rather not make a fuss. I don’t want the rest of the office finding out if I can help it.\nCOMPUTER: I understand, sir. My sincere apologies on this happy day.\nYORK: (SITTING DOWN) Computer, what... is... this?\nCOMPUTER: It is a cake. Your colleagues Gresh, Kayden and Wayne left it here for you.\nYORK: Who told them? Is this some kind of joke?\nCOMPUTER: No, it is a cake. Ingredients: eggs, flour, sugar, butter, baking powder, cocoa powder. Calorie breakdown: thirty-nine per cent fats, fifty-seven per cent carbohydrates, four per cent [protein. ]\nYORK: Well, it’s going in the bin.\nMIDDLEMAN: Many happy returns, Callum. One step closer to the End, eh?\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 10\nYORK: Sorry, Middleman, I didn’t realise you were [there -]\nMIDDLEMAN: And what a delightful cake.\nYORK: A gift from my generous colleagues, sir.\nMIDDLEMAN: How thoughtful. Your age today?\nYORK: Sixty; Sirs\nMIDDLEMAN: I see. Ten more years. How does that feel? I must say, I’m not looking forward to it myself — too much to do first.\nYORK: I am excited at the prospect. The great unknown.\nMIDDLEMAN: Your departure will benefit your world. You’ve done such good service already. How marvellous to know you still have the ultimate contribution ahead.\nYORK: Do you mind me asking, Siv...\nMIDDLEMAN: What?\nYORK: Well, I don’t think you’ve ever said. What is your age, sir?\nMIDDLEMAN: That’s classified, I’m afraid.\nYORK: Oh, of course. I'm Sorry, Sir.\nMIDDLEMAN: But do enjoy your cake.\nYORK: Thank you, sir.\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 11\nYORK: SCENE 5: EXT. MARKETPLACE\nCARNIVAL: ATMOSPHERE. CONTINUES THROUGH ENTIRE SCENE.\nCARNIVAL: NB: ALL B/G VOICES AUDIBLY UNDER 35. VERY IMPORTANT.\nMARKET SELLER: (OFF; U-35) Fried tailgrot - who wants some tailgrot?!\nYOUTHFUL REVELLERS: [WILDTRACK] (CHEERING — AS IN CHILLI-EATING CONTEST) Five, four, three, two, one..! — Aaaaaah!!\nFLIP: Doctor! This is perfect.\nCONSTANCE: That’s one way of putting it. I’ve never seen so much public debauchery.\nDOCTOR: Just you wait for V.E. Day.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sorry?\nMARKET: SELLER Fried tailgrot, Miss?\nCONSTANCE: It looks revolting.\nMARKET: SELLER Lovely with a bit of pink sauce, that!\nDOCTOR: I rather like it down here. Everything’s so vibrant.\nCONSTANCE: You would think that.\nFLIP: (TO MARKET SELLER) Go on, I’1l try some — what was it? Tailgrot? Got no cash, mind.\nMARKET: SELLER You’re alright, I like your smile. (FX: SPLOP IN CARDBOARD BOX) Here you go.\nMARKET: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 12\nFLIP: Aw, thanks. (MOUTHFUL) Actually... that’s not bad! Tastes of grapefruit. Meaty grapefruit!\nMARKET: SELLER Best grub in Formicia.\nCONSTANCE: Formicia? Is that where we are?\nMARKET: SELLER Eh?\nFLIP: Don’t mind her — she’s got birthday brain. Right, you two stay here — I’m gonna go find us a party.\nCONSTANCE: Philippa!\nFLIP: (EXITING) You’1ll love it, Connie!\nCONSTANCE: Oh my...\nDOCTOR: She means well.\nCONSTANCE: I know. She’s got so much energy — she makes me feel...\nDOCTOR: Yes, quite.\nCONSTANCE: Do you not ‘do’ birthdays, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I lost track of all that a long time ago.\nCONSTANCE: I’m sure the TARDIS could keep track for you. If you wanted. With some kind of alarm, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: As you know, Mrs Clarke — I am not a Time Lord to be scheduled.\nCONSTANCE: Indeed. (BEAT) That billboard, Doctor — what do you make of it?\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR: ‘The End is the Beginning’? — Well, it’s an advertising slogan, I suppose. Advertising what, I couldn’t say.\nCONSTANCE: It reminds me of the War Office posters — a call to arms.\nFLIP: Doctor, Constance, I want you to meet Chloe — it was Chloe, yeah?\nCHLOE: Yeah! — Nice to meet you! Whose birthday is it, then?\nCONSTANCE: That would be me.\nFLIP: Chloe’s got some spare tickets to an all-nighter in the West Square — come on, do we fancy it? Wren party! Wren party!\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure —\nCHLOE: (EYEING UP THE DOCTOR) Hang about. You didn’t mention him.\nFLIP: What?\nCHLOE: I’m sorry. She can come, but not him.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nCHLOE: You’ll have to leave him here.\nCONSTANCE: I’m afraid we can’t —\nCHLOE: Come on. They’1l catch up with him, you know. Sooner or later.\nFLIP: Eh? It’s just the Doctor!\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 14\nCHLOE: Look, he’s not my problem. I’1l be here at nine if you still want to come. And as for you...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nCHLOE: You should be ashamed of yourself.\nDOCTOR: Was it something I said?\nFLIP: Well. Some new B.F.F. she turned out to be. Sorry about that.\nCONSTANCE: What exactly were you supposed to be ashamed of?\nDOCTOR: The list is potentially endless. — She seemed very serious though, didn’t she?\nFLIP: Maybe curly hair is illegal here? Or Time Lords — maybe they hate Time Lords! Anyway, we’ve still got to find you a party, Connie.\nCONSTANCE: Look, Flip, I really appreciate you wanting to do this for me — I do. But can’t we do something a little quieter? On a smaller scale?\nFLIP: Got it: spa!\nCONSTANCE: Spa?\nFLIP: Do it for my Mum every year. She goes loopy for a spa day. How would you feel, Connie, about a proper birthday pamper?\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure. The last time we visited a spa...\nFLIP: That was back in seventeen hundred and something! On the other Side of the square, I saw this place that looked like a health spot — massages, facials, that kind of thing. Only with robots.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 15\nCONSTANCE: (UNIMPRESSED) I suppose it had to be with robots.\nDOCTOR: Well, you ladies will just have to carry on in my absence.\nFLIP: Come on, Doctor. Do you the world of good. Take the weight of the universe off your shoulders.\nDOCTOR: Flip, I’ve lived for nearly a millennium, fought innumerable intergalactic tyrants, liberated countless worlds and civilisations — and I’ve never once felt the slightest inclination to receive a robot massage.\nFLIP: Well, maybe that’s why you’re so wound up all the time.\nDOCTOR: All that lying around — far too close to sleeping for my liking.\nCONSTANCE: Then again, I suppose it sounds rather more civilised than a... Wren Party?\nFLIP: That’s right!\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nCONSTANCE: Oh, do let’s go, Doctor. I have to confess, I’m coming round to the idea.\nDOCTOR: As it’s your birthday, Mrs Clarke.\nFLIP: Alright! But we’re still calling it a Wren Party.\nDOCTOR: I’ve a feeling I’m going to regret this...\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: SCENE 6: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE\nYORK: Computer — camera three-four-two, please.\nCOMPUTER: Three-four-two full screen.\nYORK: Hold on. Please check colour balance.\nCOMPUTER: Colour balance correct.\nYORK: That coat actually looks like that?!\nCOMPUTER: Registering seventy-six individual colour tones.\nYORK: Staggering exhibitionism. I take it these are our unregistered civilians?\nCOMPUTER: Correct. Ages not logged for all three individuals.\nYORK: Alright, dispatch a scan drone.\nCOMPUTER: Dispatching.\nCOMPUTER: Mr York. We have a new arrival in the Birthday Room.\nYORK: Thank you. Please patch it through to the Middleman’s office — he was keen to congratulate anyone reaching the End this afternoon.\nCOMPUTER: Connecting now.\nYORK: I think it’s perverse. A computer could do it. I think he enjoys it...\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 17\nYORK: SCENE 7: INT. THE BIRTHDAY ROOM\nJAVONTE: Where am I?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Happy birthday, Javonte.\nJAVONTE: It’s finally happening, then.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You are close to the End. I’m so proud to be able to usher you through... personally.\nJAVONTE: Please, please, I’m not ready. You can’t make me go.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) It’s time to record your last message, Javonte. Choose your words with care — for the sake of your family. Ready?\nJAVONTE: I have no choice in this, so.. Gaynor, please don’t be too unhappy, we’ll be back together soon. I still remember the day we met. You were sat across from me on the transport — arms crossed, staring out of the window, and I leaned over and said hello... and you didn’t tell me to get lost. I.. Please, do we have to do this? I don’t want this. I don’t.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Your departure will benefit your world.\nJAVONTE: You can’t just decide what’s best for me!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Computer — time remaining?\nCOMPUTER: Twelve seconds until the End.\nMIDDLEMAN: Please take over. This creature isn’t worth my time.

Are you going anywhere nice on holiday this year, sir?\nDOCTOR: (VOICE WOBBLING AS MASSAGE CONTINUES) Flip?\nFLIP: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This is doing very little for my tension!\nCONSTANCE: Well, I’m beginning to feel... surprisingly relaxed. (REACTS IN A\nMINOR: WAY TO BEING MASSAGED THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE SCENE)\nDOCTOR: The whole experience is giving me robophobia. (GETTING OFF\nMASSAGE: BENCH) I’m sorry, no!\nFLIP: Doctor, don’t you dare run off!\nCOMPUTER: Is something the matter, sir?\nDOCTOR: I had a better time stretched out on the rack in the Tower of London. Mrs Clarke, Mrs Ramon, please excuse me. I shall see you later. (EXITS)\nFLIP: Stop massage. (GETS UP, CALLING AFTER) Doctor, come back! Doctor! — Doctor, you’re useless...\nOLIVIA: What’s your mate’s problem? Apart from the obvious.\nCOMPUTER: Proceeding to full pedicure.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, computer.\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 20\nFLIP: Don’t mind him. — What are you having done?\nOLIVIA: Oh, everything — it’s not worth doing if you don’t have the whole lot. They’ve got a special on diamond-tipped eyelashes now — did you hear?\nFLIP: That sounds... nice?\nOLIVIA: Might try that today. Have you been before?\nFLIP: First time.\nOLIVIA: I pretty much live here. Spa all day, party all night — that’s the life.\nFLIP: That sounds amazing. I’m Flip by the way — nice to get a robo- massage beside you.\nOLIVIA: Olivia. Likewise.\nFLIP: So you just do this all day? You don’t have to work?\nOLIVIA: Why would I? I’m only twenty-six.\nFLIP: Well jel. Young people don’t have to work? I could get to like it here.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean ‘here’?\nFLIP: Nothing.\nOLIVIA: Working’s what parents are for. My Dad’s been head down in the Middle for years to let me do what I want out here, bless him.\nFLIP: The Middle?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 21\nOLIVIA: Yeah, course. (CONFIDENTIALLY) Look, do you mind me asking...?\nFLIP: (CONFIDENTIALLY BACK) What?\nOLIVIA: Your two friends... how old are they?\nFLIP: Ha! You can’t ask that — Mrs Clarke here’s a lady! (WHISPERS) A lady who’s turning thirty-five...\nOLIVIA: Ah, so that’s why you’re here? A goodbye party?\nFLIP: Goodbye to what?\nOLIVIA: Well, her freedom.\nFLIP: What?\nOLIVIA: And your older gent — you know, he really shouldn’t be out in public. He’s so obvious.\nFLIP: I’ve been saying that for ages — but look, what do you mean by\nOLIVIA: They’1l arrest him, you know.\nFLIP: You know, you’re the second person to... why would they want arrest him?\nOLIVIA: Well. As a coward.\nFLIP: The Doctor’s lots of things, but he’s definitely not a coward.\nOLIVIA: He’s here, isn’t he? So he’s shirking his duties.\nFLIP: Yeah — he’s shirking with me. He’s my friend.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 22\nOLIVIA: I shouldn’t even be talking to you. — In fact, I really shouldn’t. Pedicure off, please.\nCOMPUTER: Pedicure halted.\nFLIP: Hey, wait -\nOLIVIA: See you around, OK? Just not with your friends. (EXITS)\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 23\nOLIVIA: SCENE 9: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE\nYORK: Computer, I’d like to send my birthday message now.\nCOMPUTER: Now recording sixtieth birthday message. You have ten remaining until the End.\nYORK: Computer, deactivate yourself — I’d like to say this in private.\nYORK: Hey. It’s me. Hope I don’t look too different. A bit more grey, a few more lines, but still your old Dad. Sixty today — didn’t want to make a fuss, obviously. I saw you on the cameras yesterday — on West Square, I think. I always wonder if you’1ll somehow know I’m watching and give me a wave. It’s not happened yet. That’s the problem with these annual messages — so hard to have an actual chat. Anyway, I’m still looking forward to your next one. Ten more to go for me. I used to think I'd be excited about it — happy to make the ultimate sacrifice. But the closer I get, the more it scares me. And I think the outlook is worse these days. There’s a lot of chatter here.. that something big is coming. All to do with the End. So just... be careful, OK? Be really careful. And... I love you.\nYORK: Computer - reactivate.\nCOMPUTER: Good evening, Mr York.\nYORK: Look... can I record that again? I wasn’t happy with that.\nCOMPUTER: Your birthday message has now been sent. Next communication available in one year.\nYORK: Many happy returns...\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 24\nYORK: SCENE 10: EXT. SPA\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, I really don’t know why you had to kick up such a fuss.\nDOCTOR: My dear Constance, when one has been strangled by as many androids as I have, you’d rather not pay for the privilege.\nFLIP: Doctor, that girl I was next to — she was saying you were illegal too.\nDOCTOR: Well, you can tell her that I have been tried for my crimes on more than one occasion — and I’ve always been acquitted.\nFLIP: (SENSING SOMETHING WASN’T RIGHT) ‘Older gent’. That’s what she called you. An ‘older gent’\nCONSTANCE: (REALISATION) Goodness gracious.\nFLIP: Yeah — that’s it, isn’t it?!\nDOCTOR: (BAFFLED) What’s what?\nFLIP: We’ve met, like, I don’t know how many people now? And they’ve all been young.\nCONSTANCE: Everyone in the square. Everyone in the spa.\nFLIP: Ever since we landed, we’ve seen no-one old. No-one middle- aged, even!\nDOCTOR: (LOOKING AROUND) Really? Well... (BIT DESPERATE) Maybe all this is part of a university campus, perhaps??\nFLIP: You don’t think that. Doctor, I think there’s something weird\nFLIP: going on round here.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 25\nCONSTANCE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Some kind of drone...\nFLIP: Jared's mate got one of those — flew it near Heathrow and they shot it down. Hello, little cutie!\nDRONE: Unregistered citizens... scanning, scanning.\nFLIP: Oi, watch it!\nDOCTOR: I daresay this is rather more sophisticated than anything one of Jared’s mates might be able to acquire. It reminds me of an oculoid tracker...\nDRONE: Age scan activate.\nFLIP: Doctor, what’s it doing? What’s that red light?\nDOCTOR: Just let it scan you, Flip. Maybe it’1l help give us some answers about this odd place.\nCONSTANCE: Is it safe?\nDOCTOR: Scans tend to be — even red ones - how do you feel?\nFLIP: Fine, I think — just a bit blinded.\nDRONE: Subject age.. nineteen. Registered Beginning.\nFLIP: Cheeky, ain’t he?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 26\nCONSTANCE: I think it’s my turn.\nDRONE: Subject age... thirty-four. Sixteen minutes remaining till Middle.\nFLIP: Oh, right — so technically it’s not your birthday yet?\nCONSTANCE: Evidently not. Although quite how it knows that is beyond me.\nDOCTOR: Ah, now I may be something of a surprise to you...\nDRONE: Scanning, scanning...\nDRONE: THE DOCTOR’S AGE).\nDRONE: Subject age... subject age... ninety-eight, ninety-eight, one hundred and seventy-six, three hundred and twenty-one, four hundred and fifty-seven, six hundred and forty-six — six — six — Z2zzix, zZZZixxx.. systems overloading. Systems overloading.\nDOCTOR: Serves you right for being such a nosey parker!\nDRONE: Subject too old for system calibrations.\nDOCTOR: Well, of all the cheek!\nDRONE: Z2Z2Z.. 2zz.. Correction. Subject designated over seventy. Proceed to the End.\nDOCTOR: Now, what do you mean by —\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 27\nDRONE: End.\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, what’s it doing? It’s shaking!\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. Flip, Constance, whatever you do —\nCONSTANCE: He’s gone!\nFLIP: (TO DRONE) OI! What did you just do to our friend?\nDRONE: Subject has been transported to the End.\nFLIP: You bring him back right now!\nDRONE: Registration complete.\nFLIP: Come back! Where’s Heathrow security when you need them?\nCONSTANCE: Sixteen minutes.\nFLIP: What?\nCONSTANCE: It said ‘sixteen minutes’ when it scanned me. until Middle’.\nFLIP: A countdown?\nCONSTANCE: A countdown to what?\nFLIP: Whatever it is, it’s sixteen minutes from now. Probably fifteen minutes now.\nFLIP: ‘Sixteen minutes\nFLIP: Or from then.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 28\nCONSTANCE: Until what? Oh, Flip, this is just typical — I didn’t even want a birthday fuss!\nFLIP: Well, it wasn’t me who brought us to the planet of the Age Police!\nCONSTANCE: The Middle. What’s the Middle?\nFLIP: Olivia...\nCONSTANCE: What?\nFLIP: That girl in the spa — Olivia — she said her Dad works at the Middle.\nCONSTANCE: Well... we need to go and find her then — quickly!\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 29\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 11: INT. THE BIRTHDAY ROOM\nDOCTOR: Gngh... transmats always make my spine rattle. And — (FINDS\nHIMSELF: RESTRAINED) — you know, it’s not nice to be teleported into restraints! Not nice at all. Hello! — Is anyone listening?\nCOMPUTER: Query: double heartbeat detected. Recalibrating.\nDOCTOR: Computer? Computer, this is not on! I demand you return me to my friends at once!\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12: EXT. MARKETPLACE\nDOCTOR: BEFORE.\nCONSTANCE: How long do we have — I mean, how long do I have?\nFLIP: Six minutes or so, I think. That’s a guess!\nCONSTANCE: I’m close to the Middle. But the Doctor — that machine said he was at ‘the End’...\nFLIP: Doesn’t sound too rosy, does it?\nCONSTANCE: It does not. Is that why there are no older people here? Is there some sort of cull? Goodness, it’s too horrible to think about.\nFLIP: Hey, I’m sure the Doctor will have a trick up his sleeve.\nCONSTANCE: I certainly hope so.\nFLIP: Ah, I see her — Olivia — she’s over there, just leaving the spa! (CALLING) Olivia! Liv!\nOLIVIA: Oh, hello. What happened to your illegal friend?\nCONSTANCE: Olivia, you have to help us. The Doctor was scanned by some kind of robot —\nFLIP: A drone!\nCONSTANCE: A drone. It said I was sixteen minutes from the Middle — what does that mean?\nOLIVIA: Oh, come on — don’t ask silly questions. What is it with you lot?\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 31\nFLIP: Look, we’re really thick, ok? Unbelievably stupid. Please, just tell us!\nOLIVIA: Well — that’s the Middle, over there.\nCONSTANCE: The glass tower?\nOLIVIA: That’s the centre of government. That’s where you’re going.\nCONSTANCE: I am?\nOLIVIA: You’re turning thirty-five, so I’m afraid the fun times are over. They’1ll put you to work — doing all the jobs that keep Formicia going. Boring but... that’s life.\nCONSTANCE: I’d hate to be considered a shirker, but I can’t say it appeals.\nOLIVIA: You’ve got no choice.\nFLIP: Look, our friend — it scanned him and it said he was very old. Then it said something about ‘the End’ and it, you know, vanished him.\nOLIVIA: The End? I didn’t think he looked that old. You must give me the number of his plastic surgeon.\nCONSTANCE: But what does it mean — the End?\nOLIVIA: Well, it’s the End. You won’t see him again.\nFLIP: Connie — that drone...\nCONSTANCE: It’s come back for me.\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 32\nFLIP: OK, we should run.\nCONSTANCE: No, Flip. You heard what Olivia said. I’ve got no choice. Maybe I can get some answers in the Middle, find out what’s happened to the Doctor — before it’s too late.\nDRONE: Scanning... scanning...\nFLIP: Are you sure?\nCONSTANCE: No.\nDRONE: Subject age... thirty-five. Process to the Middle.\nCONSTANCE: (FADING AWAY) All this fuss over a silly little birthday...\nFLIP: She’s gone. What am I supposed to do now?\nOLIVIA: (HER VOICE SOUNDING MORE MATURE — LESS OF A POSE) You really don’t know any of this, do you?\nFLIP: Look, me and my friends — we’re not from around here. As if you hadn’t guessed.\nOLIVIA: But that’s not possible — this is all there is. There’s nothing beyond Formicia.\nFLIP: You sure about that, Olivia?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 33\nFLIP: SCENE 13: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE\nCOMPUTER: Sir, pre-programmed target located.\nMIDDLEMAN: You’ve found her? Show me.\nOLIVIA: You really don’t know any of this, do you?\nMIDDLEMAN: Yes, that’s her. She thought she could hide... but a little detective work was all it needed.\nCOMPUTER: Subject lock — procedure?\nMIDDLEMAN: Cloaked — we need to keep this under wraps.\nCOMPUTER: Activating.\nMIDDLEMAN: Goodbye, Miss Olivia.\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 34\nMIDDLEMAN: SCENE 14: EXT. MARKETPLACE\nOLIVIA: Look, if you’re telling the truth, there’s something I should —\nSPILLING: APPLES ACROSS THE SQUARE. THERE ARE SCREAMS.\nMARKET TRADERS: [WILDTRACK ]\nFLIP: Erm. That stall just exploded. Was that supposed to happen?\nOLIVIA: We're in danger.\nFLIP: What is that? I don’t see anything, but —\nMARKET: SELLER Hey, my shop! Who did that?\nOLIVIA: (TO FLIP) I’m sorry — this is my fault. They want me dead.\nFLIP: Who does?\nOLIVIA: I thought I was hidden — like this assassin they’ve sent. Evidently his disguise is better than mine.\nFLIP: There’s something there — like a huge animal. I can’t see it.\nFLIP: But I can hear it.\nOLIVIA: Run!!!\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 35\nOLIVIA: SCENE 15: INT. BIRTHDAY ROOM\nCOMPUTER: Recalibration complete. Echo in monitoring system confirmed.\nDOCTOR: Well, hadn’t you better get me out of here, then?\nCOMPUTER: Error confirmed as non-fatal. Error reported to technical Support. Processing can continue.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure about that?\nCOMPUTER: Welcome, citizen. You do a great thing for your people. Please record a final message for your family after the tone.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nCOMPUTER: Please begin recording of final message.\nDOCTOR: I have no desire to leave a final message for anyone! I only want to get out of here!\nCOMPUTER: Then you must proceed to the End.\nDOCTOR: ‘The End’. Is this what I think it is? Some kind of euthanasia program? Murdering the elders, so the young can visit the spa?\nCOMPUTER: Ten, nine, eight, seven, [six, five, four, three, two —]\nDOCTOR: This is monstrous! Let me out at once! You have no right!\nCOMPUTER: One —\nDOCTOR: Maybe this really is it...\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 36\nCOMPUTER: Welcome to the End.\nDOCTOR: No!!!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 37"

Our army may be ancient, but it is equipped, trained and managed to perfection.\nCONSTANCE: They’re like tanks — everybody’s walking around in a tank.\nMIDDLEMAN: Yes. Sure. Oh, and keep an eye on this one, in particular — new recruit. His readings were very unusual, but sometimes the unusual conscripts can make the best fighters. The suit draws on their more pronounced experiences.\nMIDDLEMAN: AND JANAITYA APPEARS. DUB IN FROM PREVIOUS SCENE —\nDOCTOR: . Well, it’s very impressive. More power to your electronic elbow. [ETC]\nCONSTANCE: Doct— (STOPS HERSELF) — oh. Yes, I see.\nMIDDLEMAN: Don’t be fooled, a lot of facelifts among that lot. (CURIOUS) Still, that’s excellent work. Doesn’t look a day over forty...\nCONSTANCE: I’ll keep an eye on him, shall I?\nMIDDLEMAN: Yes. Yes, thank you...\nCONSTANCE: Constance. Mrs Constance Clarke.\nMIDDLEMAN: Nice to meet you, Constance. I am the Middleman. You may call me Sir.\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 50\nMIDDLEMAN: SCENE 22: INT. ARMY BARRACKS\nDOCTOR: So you’re an army of the elderly.\nROMAN: Oi, less of that.\nDOCTOR: Look, I’m all for the empowerment of the older generation — you can do whatever you want to do. But why? Why create a force like this?\nJANAIYA: These suits — they draw power from our memories, our experiences. So us older folk, we’ve got the greatest resource of all: a good long life. We’re veterans already, aren’t we? The more you’ve lived, the stronger you are. No need to send the kids out to fight when we can do it for ‘em — they’re better off making babies.\nDOCTOR: Ants...\nJANAIYA: I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: In an ant colony, the young are protected, and it’s the oldest ants who are sent out of the nest to carry out all the most dangerous jobs. They’ve lived a life, they’ve served the queen well, and they’re now expendable. Protect the young, protect the queen. They dutifully trot out and carry the biggest seeds, scout the most dangerous terrain and defend the colony against attackers until their dying breath.\nROMAN: So we’re ants then, are we?\nDOCTOR: Growing old does not make you expendable. But somebody round here obviously sees it that way.\nJANAITYA: I used to keep one of those little ant farms — so you can see through the side. They all looked the same to me — young or old.\nDOCTOR: A society turned on its head.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 51\nROMAN: Whatever you say. Look, we’ve got an inspection coming and you’d better be smartly turned out. Has Janaiya shown you basic movement?\nDOCTOR: I think I’ve got it. Walking is just... think it, lean into ita little and...\nDOCTOR: AND SIRENS SOUNDING ON HIS SUIT.\nDOCTOR: Whoops! I feel like a fawn learning to walk.\nROMAN: Pretty big fawn.\nJANAIYA: You’ve just got to think it as deep as you can. It can help to summon up a memory — to add fuel to the fire. Try not to make it too profound a recollection — tends to jam the suits up a bit. Just keep it light for now — think happy thoughts, happy memories.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I feel very uneasy about all of this. The inside of my head is not a place fit for machines. There aren’t many straight lines in there.\nROMAN: Whatever you say. Right, let’s show you how your artillery works. You’ve got your ten-thousand-round minigun here, and on the other arm there’s your phased plasma rifle — that one can give a real kick...\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary, Roman. I’m not one for firearms, and I certainly won’t be turned into a weapon.\nROMAN: You’ve not got a lot of choice, I reckon.\nDOCTOR: We'll see about that. I don’t intend to stay cooped up in this suit of armour against my will. Let’s see...\nDOCTOR: If I can just recalibrate the...\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 52\nROMAN: Good luck with that.\nDOCTOR: No... or maybe I can...\nBEEP: COMES BACK AT HIM.\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s no need to be rude.\nJANAIYA: Doctor, the suit is part of you now — no need to fiddle with it. You’ll work in it, sleep in it, do everything in it.\nROMAN: Yeah, everything.\nJANAIYA: Thank you, dear.\nDOCTOR: So I’m a prisoner? We’re all prisoners.\nLOADING: AS HE TALKS.\nROMAN: Actually, we don’t see it like that.\nDOCTOR: Well, how do you see it?\nROMAN: This here’s an honour. We’re fighting for our people —\nJANAIYA: For our grandchildren.\nROMAN: Doctor, I played with model soldiers when I was a boy, and I looked up to my Granddad when he joined up. All I wanted to do was be like him. And now I am. We fight for our world. We’re the End — we’ve been put in these suits to fight to the bitter one. And you’1ll be fighting alongside, I have no doubt.\nDOCTOR: I am not... I will not fight anyone. I am not a soldier.\nDOCTOR: CROSS TO —\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE [CONTINUOUS]\nROMAN: (D) If you’re no soldier, then coward you are.\nDOCTOR: (D) Well. So be it.\nBARRACKS: NOISE RUNS UNDERNEATH —\nCONSTANCE: What are you up to, Doctor...?\nCOMPUTER: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.\nCONSTANCE: (MOMENTARILY STARTLED) Ah! (COLLECTS HERSELF) A computing machine that talks to you. How... disarming.\nCOMPUTER: I am here to assist you.\nCONSTANCE: Very well. Tell me everything I can do from here. From this desk.\nCOMPUTER: You have access to all monitoring equipment on Formicia.\nCOMPUTER: Reminder: You have one birthday allocation.\nCONSTANCE: I do wish people would stop rabbiting on about my birthday.\nCOMPUTER: You are allocated one birthday message. You will receive your next allocation in twelve months’ time.\nCONSTANCE: Well, why didn’t you say? Happy birthday to me. Can I contact anyone?\nCOMPUTER: You may use your birthday allocation to send a one-way message to any one individual on Formicia.\nCOMPUTER: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 54\nCONSTANCE: Then... I would like to send a message to the Doctor. (SOTTO) Sorry, Flip...\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 55\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 24: EXT. CITY PARK\nCONSTANCE: (AS BEFORE). STILL CARRYING DRONE.\nFLIP: Hang about, can we put this drone of yours down a minute? It’s heavier than it looks.\nOLIVIA: Alright, but not for long.\nFLIP: What’s all that? Another party?\nOLIVIA: The all-nighters start early — they’1ll be going from now till the sun comes up.\nFLIP: I used to like that. Find it all a bit exhausting now.\nOLIVIA: Welcome to my world. I’m sick of it. The young people on Formicia — they’re smart, they’re really smart — but they don’t use it, they just muck about. It’s all parties and hangovers, whilst an army goes to war in our name. And there’s more and more of us who just aren’t accepting that as the status quo.\nFLIP: So you’re.. what are you? A secret agent? Undercover as a spoilt little rich kid?\nOLIVIA: I’m not undercover — I’m me. I just.. I have to wear that face you first met to get by, to not get noticed. But I’d much rather not wear it. I play the game, but underneath I’ve got my own game. I want to change all this - bring it down.\nFLIP: Alright! Can I help?\nOLIVIA: Look, where are you three from? I mean, really?\nFLIP: Ok. Right. You’re giving straight answers so maybe I owe you a few two. The Doctor, Constance and I — we’re not from round here.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 56\nOLIVIA: You’re from the outskirts?\nFLIP: The out-outskirts. Really out. A few light years out. The outer-space-skirts.\nOLIVIA: You’re kidding.\nFLIP: I’m not, you know.\nOLIVIA: No-one’s visited this city since we were sealed in.\nFLIP: You were sealed in? By who?\nOLIVIA: Oh, we did it. The surface has been uninhabitable for hundreds of years, thanks to us. We dropped a bomb to end a war. But it’s OK — we just do our own thing down here.\nFLIP: Right — next question: everybody keeps banging on about how old people are here — how come?\nOLIVIA: OK, let’s do the basics. On Formicia, the young get to have fun. From when you’re born through to your thirty-fifth birthday, you just enjoy yourself. No work, no responsibilities.\nFLIP: Now, I like that bit. I know you’re suddenly not keen, but it sounds great to me.\nOLIVIA: But you turn thirty-five, and you’re not a Beginner anymore — you’re in the Middle.\nFLIP: Right! Like Constance! So what happens to people in the Middle?\nOLIVIA: When you turn thirty-five, you go there and you never come back. And that... is where my Dad is.\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 57\nOLIVIA: SCENE 25: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE\nCONSTANCE: . Anyway, that’s it — Constance Clarke signing off. See you soon, Doctor Smith.\nCOMPUTER: Birthday message concluded.\nCONSTANCE: Thank you, computing machine. (GETTING UP) Excuse me.\nCOMPUTER: You must remain at your workstation. You have monitoring duties.\nCONSTANCE: I’m just going for a shufti. If you even know what that means. Don’t worry, I’ll catch up. But in the meantime — this is your off switch, I take it?\nCOMPUTER: Powering down...\nCONSTANCE: Nighty night. (TO SELF) Now, let’s find out where I am.\nOFFICE: CHATTER AND TYPING, COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS ETC.\nCONSTANCE: (UNDER HER BREATH) Reminds me of Bletchley — all the busy little worker ants. The machines are a little more compact, mind you.\nFLIP: (DISTANT, OFF SCREEN) Ah, that thing — big revolving glass tower, like Docklands had an acid trip.\nCONSTANCE: Now, I’d know that voice anywhere...\nYORK: I’m sorry?\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 58\nCONSTANCE: Oh! Sorry to interrupt your.. monitoring. I’m new. Mrs Constance Clarke.\nYORK: Nice to meet you — Callum. Callum York.\nCONSTANCE: Nice you meet you too.\nYORK: Wait — you’re very new, aren’t you? Today new?\nCONSTANCE: Indeed. (IRONIC) Happy birthday to me.\nYORK: Ha. I sympathise — I’d happily abolish birthdays if I could.\nCONSTANCE: A man after my own heart.\nYORK: So this is us. Not a bad team and not a bad view.\nCONSTANCE: It’s very beautiful. Though all the revolving makes my head Spin.\nYORK: You get used to it.\nCONSTANCE: (LOOKING BACK TO SCREENS) And... who are these two you’re keeping an eye on?\nYORK: (HASTILY) Oh, ignore them — I shouldn’t even be monitoring this sector, really. Please, keep it to yourself.\nCONSTANCE: Oh, you can trust me — loose lips sink ships and all that.\nYORK: What?\nCONSTANCE: So who are they?\nYORK: The girl with the voice that goes right through you — I’m not sure. And the other... well.. she’s my daughter.\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 59\nCONSTANCE: Ah.\nCROSS TO: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 60\nCROSS TO: SCENE 26: EXT. CITY PARK\nCROSS TO: DISTANT.\nOLIVIA: I’ve not seen him in person since I was six. We used to be quite a team. He was really tall, but I think that’s just because I was really small. Then it was his thirty-fifth birthday, and suddenly he wasn’t here anymore. He was in there. The Middle.\nFLIP: Daft question but... can’t you just visit?\nOLIVIA: No-one out, nobody in. They say the Middle need to concentrate on their duties. They’ve had their fun. I think that’s why we\nOLIVIA: enjoy ourselves so much out here when we’re young — because we know what’s coming.\nFLIP: Wow. So you’ve not seen him for, like...\nOLIVIA: Twenty-five years.\nFLIP: Wow.\nOLIVIA: All we get are one-way messages. On his birthday, he can send me a video message. On my birthday, I can send the same to him. It’s not much of a conversation, to be honest. I just see him looking a bit older each time... until he turns seventy, of course.\nFLIP: Why, what happens then?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 61\nFLIP: SCENE 27: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS\nFLIP: SOUNDS.\nCOMPUTER: (FX: OVER P.A.) The battalion will prepare for a special announcement.\nJANAIYA: Ah, Roman!\nROMAN: I knew it. That’s brilliant, that is.\nDOCTOR: What is? What’s going on?\nJANAIYA: We'll be hearing from the Middleman shortly — there must be big news coming.\nROMAN: Maybe our marching orders!\nDOCTOR: This Middleman — who is he?\nJANAIYA: He’s in charge. The Middleman’s in charge of everything.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s not what his name would suggest. But if he is in charge, maybe I can reason with him to —\nDOCTOR: What was that? Am I done like a microwave meal?\nJANAIYA: You’ve got a birthday message — on your comm-link, see? That’s nice — a very special occasion when that happens.\nDOCTOR: Well, how do I play it?\nROMAN: Just think it.\nDOCTOR: Very well — ‘play’.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 62\nSCREEN: IS CONSTANCE.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Doctor? Doctor, I hope you’re receiving this safely.\nDOCTOR: Constance! Mrs Clarke, where are you?\nROMAN: Don’t work like that — one-way traffic only. You do the listening.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nCONSTANCE: (D) I see you have a new metal wardrobe — very, er, fetching.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mrs Clarke.\nJANAITYA: She can’t hear you.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know.\nCONSTANCE: (D) (CONFIDENTIALLY — SHE DOESN’T WANT TO BE OVERHEARD) This place is distinctly odd. They seem to have it in for the over- thirty-fives. I find myself employed in the Middle — which is all rather dull and dreary, but at least I can keep an eye on you. Philippa too, I hope. I think I’m where the army generals are — miles behind the poor blessed infantry, as usual. So I’m going to do my level best to flush them out.\nDOCTOR: Good work!\nCONSTANCE: (D) .. Anyway, that’s it — Constance Clarke signing off. See you soon, Doctor Smith. [NB: THIS LINE EXACTLY AS HEARD AT TOP OF SCENE 25]\nDOCTOR: Janaiya, Roman — you’ve worked there, you must know all about the Middle?\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 63\nJANAITYA: What’s to know? It was all very, very dull. The End is far more interesting!\nROMAN: This is it.\nJANAIYA: Stand to attention, Doctor, or they’1ll reprimand you.\nDOCTOR: I’1l stand here as I please, thank you, Janaiya. I feel like giving someone a piece of my mind.\nDOCTOR: What’s that little fellow up to?\nJANAIYA: It’s a holo-matter unit. Watch.\nJANAIYA: WITH A ‘WUUUUVVVVVVV’ SOUND. THE MIDDLEMAN IS PROJECTED AS A 50 FT HIGH HOLOGRAM, STOOD IN FRONT OF HIS ARMY.\nJANAIYA: There he is — the Middleman.\nDOCTOR: Good grief — who projects a fifty-foot hologram of themselves? The ego is insurmountable!\nROMAN: It ain’t his fault he can’t leave the Middle. And I like him big. Nice to have someone to look up to.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) (BOOMING, ECHOING ABOVE HIS TROOPS) The End. I salute you.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK — INC ROMAN & JANATYA] The End is the beginning!\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 64\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) And what a beginning you are. Our whole civilisation looks up to you with unfathomable respect. What you will do in the next twenty-four hours will echo through our future history. Your lives have been lived well... and I know you will give everything you have in return.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK — INC ROMAN & JANATYA] THE END IS THE BEGINNING!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You will inspire a generation to grow old and show valour as you do now. You safeguard your families, you protect your grandchildren with your bravery. And I have the most wonderful news. Today, within the next few hours — every man and woman of you — are going to war.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK — INC ROMAN & JANATIYA] WARRRRRRR! (CHEERS ETC)\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) The enemy is near. You may have heard rumours, and I can confirm their truth: the Kronvos horde has returned in force.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK — INC ROMAN & JANAIYA] BOOOOO!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) They have dug through solid rock — through the flank of the planet itself - to reach us. Their only purpose is to wipe us out.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK — INC ROMAN & JANATIYA] RAWRRRRR! (BOOS ETC)\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) As I speak, their army march and would reach the city in two days’ time, if it were not for your sacrifice and valour. You must stop them, if Formicia is to live. Give your lives, give them without hesitation, and your deeds will be sung of [ forever. ]\nDOCTOR: (TINY VOICE IN COMPARISON) Excuse me? Hello?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Ah. The gentleman with the excellent surgeon. I trust you’re settling down into the ranks, conscript?\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: Not particularly. Being strapped into a mobile war machine isn’t my idea of a pleasant afternoon.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You’1ll grow into it, I’m sure.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Mr Middleman: what is this ‘Kronvos horde’ you expect us to fight?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Why — the Kronvos are monsters, of course!\nDOCTOR: Just ‘monsters’? There must be more to them than that! What do they want?\nROMAN: They want to kill us! To wipe us out!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Exactly!\nDOCTOR: By the sounds of it, these Kronvos might say exactly the same of you! — Please tell me you’ve at least attempted to settle\nDOCTOR: your differences, whatever they may be, by negotiation?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You are not here to negotiate! You are here to fight!\nDOCTOR: Well, maybe I don’t want to fight, until someone explains exactly why I’m fighting!\nJANAIYA: (CONCERN) Doctor, you need to shut up.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Are you saying you won’t fight, soldier?\nDOCTOR: Not as things presently stand — no!\nDOCTOR: THE ARMY [WILDTRACK]\nROMAN: You fool. You’ve done it now! You know what’s going to happen now!\nROMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 66\nJANAIYA: Doctor, how could you?!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You know the rules — desertion will lead directly to the elimination of loved ones. Our cowardly comrade here has one strike against his name — so I am obliged to remove one loved one from his portfolio.\nDOCTOR: What?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Let’s have a look here — your suit reports that you have a\nMIDDLEMAN: friend in the Beginning called... ‘Flip’?\nDOCTOR: What if I do?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) I’m sorry to have to tell you that an execution drone is\nMIDDLEMAN: now on its way to make her acquaintance.\nDOCTOR: What? — But you can’t!\nROMAN: That’s what they do to cowards. Entirely on you, that is.\nDOCTOR: No!!!\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: INT. MIDDLE OFFICE\nYORK: That’s irregular. They’re launching an execution drone.\nCONSTANCE: That sounds like bad news for someone.\nYORK: Look out there — you’1ll see it as it leaves.\nCONSTANCE: They kill people, then?\nYORK: It’s a punishment for cowardice. They don’t take it out on the soldier, they target those you love back home.\nCONSTANCE: What? — Where I’m from, the white feather is more than enough — and even that’s pretty barbaric.\nYORK: Let me see if I can... oh.. those co-ordinates. That’s my\nYORK: daughter!\nCONSTANCE: Your daughter... and my Flip!\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 68\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 29: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Now, new recruit — rejoin your fellows and let’s hear no more of this.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) What have I done?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) My army, ready yourself for the war to end all wars.\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILD — INC ROMAN & JANAIYA] TO THE END!\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) I will stop this.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Ready your courage, ready your hate! Give everything you\nMIDDLEMAN: have!\nMIDDLEMAN: THE ARMY [WILD — INC ROMAN & JANAIYA] TO THE END!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) The End.\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 69\nMIDDLEMAN: SCENE 30: EXT. CITY STREET\nFLIP: Another one of your drone friends.\nOLIVIA: He’s a long way from home... we don’t normally get them out this way.\nFLIP: Yeah, and the other one didn’t have shooty bits sticking out,\nFLIP: neither.\nOLIVIA: What? — It’s an execution drone!\nFLIP: OK... So why’s it heading for us?\nOLIVIA: Oh no!!!\nOLIVIA: END OF PART TWO\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 70"

In the days when the old were just left to be old. A Kronvos invasion force was gathering on the surface. Awful, ugly things. Our people had to defend their homes. On the first day of recruitment, nearly a million young men and women enlisted. They went away to fight. And they did not come back.\nDOCTOR: Such a waste.\nJANAIYA: There was only one option. The bomb that finished that war ruined the land above. That conflict wiped out an entire generation of young men and women. There was nobody to take up jobs, there was no-one to make babies, and we almost curled up and died there and then.\nDOCTOR: But you didn’t.\nJANAIYA: No, we scraped through. But it started a way of thinking — why sacrifice the young, the future of your race, when others could take their place? Us old folk have lived a life, we’re closer to the end — surely we are the more suitable soldiers?\nDOCTOR: And now the old fight the battles of the young.\nJANAIYA: Our Great-Grandparents formed this army and their descendants have grown up to follow in their footsteps ever since.\nDOCTOR: That’s a pretty warped solution, I must say.\nJANAIYA: Don’t you think we’re up to the task?\nDOCTOR: Janaiya, I don’t doubt you are. You’re capable of anything.\nJANAIYA: Don’t underestimate us, Doctor.\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 81\nJANAIYA: SCENE 39: INT. MIDDLE ATRIUM\nCONSTANCE: Good Lord — that is quite a view. Though I’m still not convinced the spinning is entirely necessary.\nYORK: It’ll be easier to talk out here in the atrium. Everyone has their lunch out here, it’s less suspicious. — Let’s sit here,\nYORK: by the public terminal.\nYORK: Mrs Clarke — I need you to be honest with me.\nCONSTANCE: Well, I’ll try — but being honest and being believed are two quite different things.\nYORK: You’re thirty-five, a new recruit. They’re usually pretty spoilt, lazy, takes them a bit of time to get into the swing. Not you. You’re more... practical.\nCONSTANCE: Why, thank you. But I’m not important. I’m really not — I’m more interested in you.\nYORK: There are plenty like me. Scared little men not wanting to grow old. Look, could you just move around a little to your right?\nCONSTANCE: Why? (REALISATION) Ah, so no-one can see you using the — what did you call it — ‘public terminal’?\nYORK: Exactly. It’ll be harder to trace.\nCONSTANCE: (SHIFTING) Very well.\nYORK: Keep talking — make it look social.

In ten years’ time, that’ll be me going to war.

Getting old, I mean.\nCONSTANCE: As we've established, I’m only thirty-five.\nYORK: In the Beginning, it was so much fun — it really was. But it went so fast. Then I reached the Middle. It was terrible at first. But in time, it stopped seeming quite so bad. The years began to shoot by. Now I find myself wishing all this would slow down, because suddenly the End is coming, and everything’s going to get so much worse and it... it frightens me, Constance!\nCONSTANCE: You know, it doesn’t have to get worse. I’m rather looking forward to my later years — I’1l have had all I can take of running around by then. It’1ll be bliss to put my feet up. I might keep an allotment, learn another language, write my memoirs.\nYORK: Ha! You’1ll turn seventy and they’1l cart you off to war — just like everyone else. These are best days you’1ll get now. Enjoy them.. while they last.\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 83\nYORK: SCENE 40: INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT [IN MOTION]\nYORK: TREADS A CONSTANT.\nCOMPUTER: (OFF) E.T.A. to enemy force — two hours.\nROMAN: Doctor, I need to know that you’ve got my back. Janaiya’s too.\nDOCTOR: Roman, I don’t even know how to work the armature of this tin suit they’ve put me in.\nJANAITYA: That’s easy. Just point your arm at the target — and think hard about shooting it.\nROMAN: Bob’s your uncle, one less Kronvos.\nDOCTOR: Lovely.\nROMAN: You’1ll do great.\nDOCTOR: Roman, maybe you can help me understand — why are you allowing this to happen? I’ve seen what your army does to conscientious objectors, but how can you accept that and still smile?\nROMAN: Well, we just want to be useful.\nDOCTOR: What?\nROMAN: I could be sitting at home, minding my old business, but I'd hate for folks to think I wasn’t giving anything back.\nJANAIYA: We wouldn’t want to be a burden. We want to keep busy — to say thank you.\nDOCTOR: By dying in a war?\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 84\nROMAN: My parents and grandparents were soldiers. Why wouldn’t I want to follow in their footsteps?\nDOCTOR: But you don’t have to!\nJANAIYA: Rather us than our children and grandchildren. Doctor, we've had good, full lives. We owe this to everyone else.\nDOCTOR: Your lives are worth just as much as anyone else’s.\nROMAN: And at least we get to go out together — me and Janaiya. It’s always been the two of us.\nJANAIYA: You won’t change our minds, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What on Earth was —\nROMAN: We’re under attack! Come on, Doctor — time to show a bit of backbone!\nROMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 85\nROMAN: SCENE 41: INT. MIDDLE ATRIUM\nCONSTANCE: What’s that?\nYORK: News from the front. A Kronvos party has advanced further than expected. The troop transports are under attack.\nCONSTANCE: My friend the Doctor’s a new recruit...\nYORK: Then he might be involved. Can he handle himself in a fight?\nCONSTANCE: He’s the original conscientious objector, I’m afraid.\nYORK: Then let’s hope he keeps his head down.\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 86\nYORK: SCENE 42: INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT/EXT. BATTLEFIELD\nYORK: OUTSIDE.\nROMAN: (SHOUTS) Come on you dogs, come meet your end! (RUSHES OUT, HOLLERING) Yaaaaaaaaa...!\nDOCTOR: Does he have to shout like that?\nJANAITYA: Keep close, Doctor — safety in numbers and all that.\nJANAITYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 87\nJANAITYA: SCENE 43: EXT. BATTLEFIELD [CONTINUOUS]\nFIZZING: LASER BOLTS ALL AROUND, HITS AND IMPACTS THROUGH:\nROMAN: (OFF) See how you like this!\nROMAN: IN THE MARKET OVER PARTS ONE/TWO.\nDOCTOR: So those are the Kronvos.\nJANAIYA: That’s right. Looks like a reconnaissance party.\nDOCTOR: Brutish looking bunch — and that armour looks pretty impenetrable.\nROMAN: (OFF) Stop slacking, Doctor! Let’s get into this!\nDOCTOR: I am not fighting!\nJANAIYA: You don’t have to. Just point and think bad thoughts. Like this. Yaaaaaa!\nKRONVOS: ROAR AT HER BUT ARE TOTALLY BLOWN APART.\nJANAIYA: There you go. Three down, twenty odd to go!\nDOCTOR: Janaiya — you just... killed them!\nJANAIYA: Oh, you are a silly fellow — come on!\nDOCTOR: Janaiya, wait.. I’m still getting used to this (STUMBLES, FALLS) Ahh!\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure there are more intuitive ways to get around. Now, which way is up?\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello. You must be a Kronvos. (WRESTLING WITH KRONVOS ) Please, can we talk? I’d like to talk.\nROMAN: (OFF) SHOOT IT! It’s got a laser bayonet!\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT — WRESTLING) Alright, then, let’s wrestle. I warm you,\nDOCTOR: though, I used to teach the Mountain Mauler of [Montana]\nDOCTOR: AND DIES.\nJANAIYA: Well, Doctor? Aren’t you going to thank Roman?\nDOCTOR: I was trying to talk to it! — Look, can you help shift this thing off me? These Kronvos are rather heavy.\nROMAN: No need.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.\nDOCTOR: Wait, what just—?\nROMAN: Kill ‘em and they disappear — learnt that in training. Guess makes for a cleaner war.\nROMAN: Zt\nROMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: These Kronvos just... disappear? (HE GETS UP) There’s something very strange going on here...\nROMAN: Come on, Doctor, we've got to — (JUMPED ON) Aaaaah!!!\nROMAN: BAYONET.\nJANAIYA: ROMAN!!! !\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 90\nJANAIYA: SCENE 44: INT. OLIVIA’S FLAT\nFLIP: Nice flat, Livvy! I was imagining a bedsit.\nOLIVIA: Not in Formicia. Not when you’re young.\nOLIVIA: Now — let’s see if I can get any sense out of this drone.\nFLIP: What, so you’re a hacker too?\nOLIVIA: They’re all connected — between each other and the Middle. It must have passcodes — something, anything that can get us past the Middle’s security. To my Dad.\nFLIP: Yeah, and Connie too!\nOLIVIA: If we can use him to connect to the mainframe — we can at least see what’s going on around here. — Here we go... The Middle is\nOLIVIA: broadcasting something right across its network.\nBATTLE: SOUNDS, OVER TINY SPEAKER, AS IN PREVIOUS SCENE (WE SHOULDN’T HEAR DOCTOR ETC THOUGH).\nOLIVIA: Wow — it’s the End. They’ve gone into battle already.\nFLIP: Look at them. Like Dad’s Army meets The Terminator.\nOLIVIA: They’re heroes.\nFLIP: Wait — those things they’re fighting... they’re like the monster in the market! (EXCITEDLY) Oh, and that’s not the only thing I recognise! There he is! There’s the Doctor!\nOLIVIA: Helping carry a body. I wonder what’s happened?\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 91\nOLIVIA: SCENE 45: INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT\nOLIVIA: ROMAN’S BODY ON BOARD...\nCOMPUTER: (VIA P.A., OFF) Immediate Kronvos threat eliminated.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Set him down here, Janaiya — there may still be time.\nROMAN: (DYING) Not a lot you can do, I reckon... That Kronvos ran right through me with its laser bayonet.\nJANAIYA: Roman, don’t you dare leave me.\nCOMPUTER: (VIA P.A., OFF) Seal transports. Mission resumes.\nROMAN: Janaiya, love, this suit is the best life-support we’ve got. I can feel.. I can feel it fading.\nJANAIYA: We were supposed to go together.\nROMAN: Typical, isn’t it? I’ve been looking forward to this fight all my life and then I go out in the first round.\nJANAIYA: You were wonderful, Roman.\nROMAN: Was I? That’s good... just like Granddad...\nJANAIYA: I love you.\nROMAN: My Janaiya, I love you too. You know what they say... the End is the beginning.\nJANAIYA: The End is the beginning. Doctor, you say it too.\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: (HOLLOWLY) “The End is the beginning.”\nROMAN: The beginning... (DIES)\nJANAIYA: Oh. Oh... (WEEPS)\nJANAIYA: Page 92\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 93\nJANAIYA: SCENE 46: INT. OLIVIA’S FLAT\nFLIP: New plan, Livvy — we need to get to the Doctor.\nOLIVIA: But he’s gone to war.\nFLIP: Exactly — he’s gone to war. He’1ll be a rubbish soldier — absolutely rubbish.\nOLIVIA: There’s no way they’1l let under-seventies through to the front line.\nFLIP: Then... lightbulb! This drone — it’s the sort that beamed the Doctor and Connie away in the first place, right?\nOLIVIA: I presume so.\nFLIP: So... maybe we can make it do the same to us?\nOLIVIA: What?\nFLIP: Me and my mates were only seventeen when we used to go clubbing in Walthamstow. You had to be twenty-one to get in anywhere, so we'd call up Dodgy Steve for fake I.D. — Get it? We faked our age!\nOLIVIA: (REALISATION) You faked your age...\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 94\nOLIVIA: SCENE 47: INT. MIDDLE ATRIUM\nYORK: That’s it — I’m into the Middleman’s system.\nCONSTANCE: Good work, Mr York.\nYORK: (PUZZLED) Strange. His itinerary shows a corporate social in the penthouse gallery this afternoon — V.I.P. access only, high end catering booked. What are they...\nCONSTANCE: Gathering to watch the fighting, I presume.\nYORK: Why would they do that?\nCONSTANCE: That’s generals all the universe over. Making all the decisions over a splendid vintage, miles from the front.\nYORK: The Middleman’s private offices are up in the penthouse. His private workstation, too. — Are you thinking what I’m thinking,\nYORK: Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: I’d say we were of one mind, Mr York...\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 95\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 48: INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT [IN MOTION]\nCOMPUTER: (D) Convoy now one kilometre from main Kronvos force. All crew at battle stations.\nDOCTOR: I’m so sorry, Janaiya.\nJANAIYA: Roman knew what he’d signed up for. He was... well, he was prepared.\nDOCTOR: For himself, maybe. But he’d never have been prepared, if it had been you.\nCOMPUTER: (D) Enemy force coming into range.\nJANAITYA: No more tears. Roman would have wanted me to carry on.\nDOCTOR: Carry on? Your husband was just killed — you can’t possibly ‘carry on’!\nJANAIYA: I can. And you’re coming with me.\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 96\nJANAIYA: SCENE 49: INT. MIDDLE PENTHOUSE\nJANAIYA: TAPED ON GLASS FOR ATTENTION.\nMIDDLEMAN: (TO CROWD) Ladies and gentlemen — Middle managers — may I have your attention?\nGUESTS: [WILDTRACK]\nMIDDLEMAN: (TO CROWD) The brave warriors of the End are about to engage the main Kronvos force. Your hard work in preparation for this glorious day has not gone unnoticed. So let us watch together, as their triumph unfolds!\nGUESTS: [WILDTRACK]\nCREEPING: IN.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) Looks like we’ve missed the speeches, thank goodness.\nYORK: (SOTTO) Keep your voice down and try not to draw attention to yourself.\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) I’11 do my best. All rather grim, isn’t it? A big screen showing live footage from a war. But the Pathe newsreel was never this vulgar.\nYORK: (SOTTO) This way — round the side...\nCONSTANCE: (SOTTO) I take it that’s the Middleman’s den?\nYORK: (SOTTO) Yes. He’s busy playing to the crowd — now’s our chance.\nCROSS BACK TO: THE MIDDLEMAN POURING CHAMPAGNE.\nMIDDLEMAN: (TO CROWD) I’m told the transports are coming to a halt — shall we wish our soldiers well?\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 97\nGUESTS: [WILDTRACK]\nMIDDLEMAN: (ASIDE, INTO HIS COMM LINK) This is a message to the End...\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 98\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: SCENE 50: INT.

I’m informed that you are about to engage the main Kronvos force.\nDOCTOR: I’m really not a fan of this man.\nJANAIYA: Shhh.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) All I can say is — good luck, and good hunting. Make us proud.\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 99\nMIDDLEMAN: SCENE 51: INT. OLIVIA’S FLAT\nOLIVIA: OK, I’ve adjusted the drone’s scanning module so it should overestimate our ages by sixty years.\nFLIP: It’ll see us as pretty ancient, then?\nOLIVIA: If I’ve got it right.\nFLIP: (OLD CRONE VOICE) And I won’t have to do my old lady voice?\nOLIVIA: Erm... no. You don’t have to do that. Here we go.\nOLIVIA: LIFE. IT HOVERS UP.\nFLIP: It’s not going to fly away, is it?\nOLIVIA: Just stay nice and still.\nDRONE: Citizens detected. Age scan activate.\nDRONE: Scanning, scanning...\nOLIVIA: Get on with it...\nDRONE: Subject age: eighty-five.\nFLIP: And you don’t look a day over twenty-one.\nDRONE: Proceed to the End.\nOLIVIA: See you soon.\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL)\nFLIP: OK, now me.\nDRONE: Scanning...\nFLIP: Still tickles.\nDRONE: Subject age... eighty-two.

Can’t turn to see you.\nCOMPUTER: Welcome, citizen. You do a great thing for your people. Please record a final message for your family after the tone.\nFLIP: No need for that — I’m ready for war! No family, nothing like that — just beam me down into the army, eh?\nCOMPUTER: Alert — subject physiology does not match designated age.\nOLIVIA: (OFF) You too.\nFLIP: (TO COMPUTER) You’re not meant to actually look at the dodgy I.D., you know!\nCOMPUTER: Second intrusion into birthday room confirmed. Preparing to terminate intruders.\nFLIP: WHAT?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 102\nFLIP: SCENE 53: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE\nYORK: There we go — the Middleman’s private workstation...\nCONSTANCE: Just be speedy, Mr York.\nYORK: I will be. — Wait. There’s an alarm in the birthday room.\nCONSTANCE: The what?\nYORK: The chamber they use to screen new recruits to the End... it’s showing two intruders. Both redesignated: Beginning. — There they are, see?\nCONSTANCE: Philippa! And your daughter!\nYORK: You don’t understand. Standard protocol is to terminate intruders.\nCONSTANCE: In which case, we need to get them out of there!\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 103\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 54: INT. THE BIRTHDAY ROOM\nCOMPUTER: Termination mode: on.\nFLIP: But you can’t! I’m too young to die!\nOLIVIA: (OFF) Don’t say that!!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Flip! Can you hear me?\nFLIP: Connie! Is that you? Where are you?! This computer wants to kill us!\nCONSTANCE: (D) Try not to panic, we’re working on it. (ASIDE) Mr York?\nYORK: (D; OFF) Nearly there!\nOLIVIA: (OFF) Dad?!?\nCOMPUTER: (GLITCHY) Termination mode: on. On. Ooooon. — Off.\nFLIP: Phew!\nCOMPUTER: Rescanning. Subject age.. eighty-four. Transport to the End.\nFLIP: That’s more like it.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 104\nFLIP: SCENE 55: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE\nCONSTANCE: They’re safe?\nYORK: If you can call it safe. I couldn’t send them back, so they’ve been sent direct to the war zone.\nMIDDLEMAN: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Out of the frying pan, into the fire.\nYORK: (TURNING) Middleman!\nMIDDLEMAN: What are you two doing in my private suite?\nCONSTANCE: (COOL) We wandered in from the party. We didn’t realise this was a restricted area. So there’s really no need to point a gun at us.\nMIDDLEMAN: You might not have known better, Mrs Clarke. But Mr York certainly does.\nYORK: Middleman, please —\nMIDDLEMAN: Callum. Shush.\nCONSTANCE: What did you do that for? (CHECKING HIM) He’s still alive.\nMIDDLEMAN: Oh! Did you want me to kill him?\nCONSTANCE: No!\nMIDDLEMAN: Then hush, or I will. — Now: I have an army to address...\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 105\nMIDDLEMAN: SCENE 56: INT. GREAT CAVE\nELECTRONIC: DOORS OPEN. ARMY START TO EMERGE, INCLUDING —\nJANAIYA: There they are, Doctor — see?\nDOCTOR: The massed ranks of the Kronvos! All in formation. Like they’re\nDOCTOR: waiting.\nJANAIYA: Murdering brutes!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Brave soldiers — I stand with you at your finest hour!\nDOCTOR: Him again!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Here they come — the horde of Kronvos! Ready arms! And\nMIDDLEMAN: remember: the End is the beginning!\nEND: TROOPS [WILDTRACK] THE END IS THE BEGINNING!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Good luck all.\nJANAIYA: This is it, Doctor. All of us against all of them.\nDOCTOR: I can’t stand by in the middle of a massacre!\nJANAIYA: So fight, Doctor! Fight!\nFLIP: Doctor! It’s me! Doctor!!!\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: Flip?! What are you doing here?!\nFLIP: Aren’t you pleased to see us? You wouldn’t believe the trouble we had getting here, me and my mate Livvy.\nOLIVIA: Hello.\nFLIP: You remember Livvy, right?\nDOCTOR: This is no time for the social niceties, Flip! This is a battlefield! Quite possibly, we’re all about to die!\nCONTINUES: THROUGH —\nFLIP: Oh yeah — those guys. I wanted to tell you — we’ve bumped into one of them already.\nDOCTOR: What?\nOLIVIA: In the city. It was after us.\nFLIP: It was invisible, and then it flickered a lot — then, briefly, like by accident, it looked just like those things.\nDOCTOR: And then it disappeared?\nFLIP: That’s right.\nOLIVIA: How did you know that?\nDOCTOR: I finally know what I’m fighting.\nJANAIYA: Here they come! Doctor — hold the line!\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 107\nEND: TROOPS [WILDTRACK] To the End! To the End!\nDOCTOR: Flip, come here. — Here!\nFLIP: What? Doctor — what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m modifying your armature — if I can set it to just the right frequency, and reroute all the power of your memories into one Single energy blast... we just might do it.\nFLIP: Do what?\nDOCTOR: You’11l see. Let’s turn you round and... fire.\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR: Trust me. Just aim at the Kronvos, think about firing — and you'll fire.\nJANAIYA: That’s the spirit!\nFLIP: You’d better be right about this.\nDEAFENING: NOISE — STOPPING EVERYONE ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN THEIR TRACKS. SILENCE.\nDEAFENING: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 108\nDEAFENING: SCENE 57: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE\nMIDDLEMAN: No.. no, that’s not possible...\nCONSTANCE: That’1ll be the Doctor, then.\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 109\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 58: INT. GREAT CAVE\nJANAIYA: The Kronvos — they’re frozen...\nOLIVIA: Frozen in their tracks.\nDOCTOR: And entirely harmless. I hope. (TURNS TO STOMP OFF)\nFLIP: Hang about, where are you going?\nJANAIYA: You can’t go into the Kronvos line!\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 110\nJANAIYA: SCENE 59: INT. GREAT CAVE — AMONG KRONVOS [CONTINUOUS]\nFROZEN: KRONVOS ARMY.\nDOCTOR: (LOUDLY) There was no Kronvos Army. There never was. You see this chap here?\nDOCTOR: This is no soldier. This is a solid-state hologram. Capable of weight, touch, killing, even — but not actually real!\nJANAIYA: This can’t be...\nDOCTOR: I reprogrammed Flip’s cannon to overload their holo-matrix. Their whole Horde is a fake. (LOUDLY AGAIN) You — the End — you are brave and valiant, but you have been deceived. There is no army for you to fight.\nJANAIYA: But why... why?\nDOCTOR: Maybe the Middleman can shed some light on that.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) You again! — I knew I should have disposed of you —\nDOCTOR: . when you had the chance?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D).1 SELLA Can.\nFLIP: He’s got a point. Probably best not to remind him.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — before you do, Middleman: would you care to explain to your army why they have no-one to fight? Why your war was a lie?\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 111\nJANAIYA: A lie.. it was all a lie... my Roman...\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) The Kronvos were necessary to test my army — to see if our heroes are truly ready. But none of them matter anymore, and that’s your fault. (ASIDE) Computer, delete Kronvos.\nEND: TROOPS [WILDTRACK]\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) The Doctor, is it? Well, Doctor — you’ve just ruined the experiment. A hundred years’ work, ruined — pff!\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, ‘experiment’?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) We’d found a new shape for society — a new shape that worked. And you’ve just charged in and destroyed it.\nDOCTOR: If that means an end to this phoney war, then I think that’s very good news.\nMIDDLEMAN: (D) Well, you say that. But I have no need for this lab anymore. I want it wiped clean. I want no-one to ever know it was ever here. And so: the rats can help me clean the lab.\nFLIP: Doctor... what’s he on about?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D; ALOUD) Hear me, army of mine. The End is not the beginning. The End is just that — there is nothing more.\nJANAIYA: No... !\nMIDDLEMAN: (D; ALOUD) You are each installed in an armoured suit of my design. Which means: I can over-ride the control of each and every one. Army — turn, about face!\nMIDDLEMAN: THE OTHER WAY — INCLUDING THE DOCTOR’S SUIT.\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 112\nJANAIYA: I can’t stop myself.\nFLIP: Me neither.\nDOCTOR: (TO MIDDLEMAN) What are you playing at now?\nMIDDLEMAN: (D; ALOUD) You will all now return to the city.. and you will raze it to the ground!!\nDOCTOR: What?!\nMIDDLEMAN: (D; ALOUD) You will destroy everything and everyone in the city. Your families included.\nJANAIYA: No — you can’t make us!\nDOCTOR: This is monstrous! (FORCED TO MARCH) Ahh!\nMIDDLEMAN: Go forth my army - go forth, and wipe the slate clean. Then, maybe, we can start all over again.\nMIDDLEMAN: END OF PART THREE\nMIDDLEMAN: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 113"

I wanted to let you all know how much I care about you. I’ve been your Middleman for nearly two decades and it’s been an honour to see Formicia grow. We’ve cheered as our elder citizens have joined the ranks of the End and prepared for a War that would protect and strengthen us all. I am here to tell you now that this War is over and we have lost. You have lost. Please hug your loved ones close and think well on the happy moments in your life. Death is coming to you. You will recognise your attackers — and maybe that is the end we all deserve. This society was a great experiment. But all experiments can fail. We have failed, I have failed — and for that, I am sorry. Message ends.\nMIDDLEMAN: (TO CONSTANCE) Do you think I got the tone right, Mrs Clarke?\nCONSTANCE: I’m not sure why you’re even bothering — you evidently have nothing but contempt for your people.\nMIDDLEMAN: I am a Middleman. The clue is in the name. I simply follow orders. My superiors on the surface couldn’t care less about the test subjects, so neither do I. We’ve violated the terms of the test study, so that’s it, over, pointless — who cares?\nCONSTANCE: (SARCASTIC) No, indeed: why care about any of the men, women and children you’ve just sentenced to death?\nMIDDLEMAN: I’m glad we see eye-to-eye on this. I shall be on my way up now, I think. Computer — initialise exo-armour.\nCOMPUTER: Exo-Ssuit ready for integration.\nCOMPUTER: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 114\nMIDDLEMAN: Let’s hope this still fits me. I’ve had a few dinners since the last time I wore it.\nATTACHING: ITSELF TO HIS BODY, WITH HYDRAULICS.\nCONSTANCE: What kind of “experiment” was it, anyhow? What was the point?\nMIDDLEMAN: It began with a question: what use are the old? They retire, they consume precious resources, and then they fade away. But we wanted more from our ageing citizens. We wanted them to prove their worth — not to sponge off the state, but to defend it. And then — if the worst happened, and they didn’t come home from the battlefield, well... surely that’d be better than sacrificing the young?\nCONSTANCE: Where I’m from, we lost many of our young men — and women. They wouldn’t have wanted to send anyone else in their place, least of all their grandmothers. They had courage. Where is your courage?\nMIDDLEMAN: ‘Courage’! What a strange idea. (FX: SUIT SEALED) Goodbye, Mrs Clarke. Run along and die with the rest of the experiment — at the hands of those who love you. Your ‘Doctor’, quite possibly...\nLEFT: ALONE.\nLEFT: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 115\nLEFT: SCENE 61: EXT. CITY STREET\nLEFT: THE DOCTOR AND FLIP CRASH THROUGH.

I dread to think of the destruction we’re capable of wreaking.\nFLIP: There must be a way out of this! Mustn’t there?\nDOCTOR: It’s not windows and bus shelters I’m worried about. It’s Mrs Clarke.\nFLIP: Connie? (REALISATION) The Middleman, he said we’d all have to kill our families...\nDOCTOR: For us, that means Mrs Clarke. Who’s still in the Middle, I presume, to judge by our direction of travel.\nFLIP: (POINTING OUT) Yeah, and we’re not the only troops headed that way. Look, up there on the flyover — it’s Livvy!\nDOCTOR: Who’s she being forced to target, I wonder...?\nFLIP: She’s stomped holes in the flyover. It’s breaking up! — Er, how do we make these things stop?\nDOCTOR: We don’t. We just have to hope the suits can take the weight of the flyover.\nFLIP: You mean...?\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR: & FLIP (BURIED) Aaaaaaaaaaah!\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: SCENE 62: INT.

So where is he now?\nCONSTANCE: He strapped on an armoured suit, and went to see his paymasters. But he’s the least of our problems now.\nYORK: Why...?\nCONSTANCE: That’s why. The Middleman has abandoned this ‘experiment’.\nYORK: ‘Experiment’ ?\nCONSTANCE: The army are here!! Head down, Mr York...!\nOLIVIA: DAD!\nYORK: Olivia..? What are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: Dad — get out! Get away from me!!\nYORK: But —\nCONSTANCE: You don’t understand, Callum!

Callum!! — You helped design the drone machines. What do you know about these suits?\nYORK: I — I remember seeing a report, about a glitch in the software...\nCONSTANCE: And?!\nYORK: And there’s a way — I think — to overload the system...\nOLIVIA: Dad, please! It wants me to raise my arm! I can’t stop it!!\nCONSTANCE: (TO YORK) What can she do, Callum?!\nYORK: The suit draws psychokinetic power from the wearer’s memories — from their experiences. But there’s only so much energy it can take in one go.\nOLIVIA: So I can overload the system how, exactly?\nYORK: By focusing on your memories. Summon up the most powerful memories you have, and it should cause the system to shut down.\nCONSTANCE: Why would that even work?\nYORK: We discovered that... when the troopers died, they burned out the system. It’s true what they say: that your whole life flashes in front of your eyes, just before the end.\nOLIVIA: But I can’t think of anything!!\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 121\nCONSTANCE: Olivia, you have to try!\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 122\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 65: INT. SUBURBAN HALLWAY\nCHLOE: Mum? Mum, you nearly killed me —\nJANAIYA: (CONCENTRATION EFFORT) Chloe, please! It took everything I had to direct my arm away. I don’t want to shoot! I’d do anything not to make it shoot! But I can’t stop it!\nCHLOE: I — I have to fetch Sophie...\nJANAIYA: Then run, Chloe! Run!!\nJANAIYA: Roman — I wish you were here, you’d know what to do... stupid suit — stop... stop moving.. I refuse this. I refuse I refuse I refuse!\nJANAIYA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 123\nJANAIYA: SCENE 66: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE\nCONSTANCE: Olivia — you have to concentrate!\nYORK: Please, Olivia...!\nOLIVIA: Alright, Dad, alright! — I remember... I remember the day they came and took you away. It was your birthday and Mum and me had made a little cake. And you looked at me and you seemed so sad, but you it was like you’d always known. I hugged you so hard, and then...\nCONSTANCE: Then what?\nYORK: Olivia, you have to remember!\nOLIVIA: Then the robots came to take you away — the ones they had before the drones — and then... then me and Mum, we just sat there on the floor, and ate the cake. Mum wasn’t well even then, I knew. But it was the last time the three of us were all together.\nOLIVIA: Wait... did that work?\nYORK: You did it! You’ve burned out the automatic guidance!\nOLIVIA: It’s back under my control. (RELIEF) Oh, Dad...!\nCONSTANCE: Yes, the family reunion can wait. The Middleman sent the entire army of the End to do the exact same thing to their families as you were about to do to him.\nYORK: What?\nOLIVIA: Your friend’s right. Dad, you need to tell each and every trooper how to overload their suits.\nOLIVIA: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 124\nYORK: Me?!\nCONSTANCE: This is the Middleman’s suite, is it not? This is his, er,\nCONSTANCE: ‘workstation’?\nYORK: (REALISATON) Yes, yes of course...!\nCONSTANCE: Then you can send out a message on the Middleman’s frequency!\nYORK: This is the Middle, with a message to all soldiers of the End...\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 125\nYORK: SCENE 67: INT.

I can’t — can’t stop it.\nJANAIYA: I’m sorry...!\nCHLOE: Mum, don’t!\nYORK: (D; FIRST SENTENCE FROM PREVIOUS SCENE) This is the Middle, with a message to all soldiers of the End...\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 126\nYORK: SCENE 68: EXT. CITY STREET\nFLIP: There! Takes more than a falling flyover to flatten a Flip!\nDOCTOR: In these suits, certainly. Which is interesting.\nFLIP: Why’s that then-? (FX: SUDDEN WHIRRING AS SUITS DRAG THEM AWAY) Whoa! We’re off again.\nDOCTOR: We’re all but invulnerable in these suits. But we saw soldiers of the End being killed by Kronvos energy weapons.\nFLIP: So...?\nDOCTOR: So, either the Kronvos holograms emitted energy beams purposely designed to penetrate these suits, or the suits were purposely designed with that particular vulnerability built in...\nFLIP: Right! And you want to find out what that is so people can shoot us dead, too? Doctor, we’re not the monsters!\nDOCTOR: In these suits, we are! There must be some way to stop us...\nYORK: (D; FIRST SENTENCE FROM PREVIOUS SCENE) This is the Middle,\nYORK: with a message to all soldiers of the End...\nCROSS TO: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 127\nCROSS TO: SCENE 69: INT.

CITY STREET\nYORK: (D) Please, just trust me on this! Imagine your whole life flashing before your eyes. Pick out your strongest memories — good ones, bad ones, doesn’t matter.\nFLIP: What’s the point of that?\nDOCTOR: No, no, it might work!\nYORK: (D) Then hold that thought. Shut out everything else! Please, it’s the only way!\nFLIP: Come off it!\nDOCTOR: Psychokinetic energy is a tangible force. It’s got to be worth a try! — Think of something in your past.\nFLIP: I can’t!\nDOCTOR: Anything!\nFLIP: I can’t!\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 129\nFLIP: SCENE 71: INT. SUBURBAN HALLWAY\nJANAIYA: I remember... the day you were born, Chloe. Roman and I transmatted to the hospital — we were in such a rush, he said not to worry about the side effects on the bump. He was so worried, so scared, and then when you arrived, it all just fell away. Roman just couldn’t stop smiling — he was smiling at you and he was smiling at me.\nCHLOE: Oh, Mum...\nCHLOE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 130\nCHLOE: SCENE 72: EXT. CITY STREET\nFLIP: Really I can’t!\nDOCTOR: There must be something, Flip! Like the man said: imagine your whole life, flashing before your eyes...\nFLIP: Oh well, I get that loads. I got that when I was getting married.\nDOCTOR: Your wedding day! Perfect!\nFLIP: Only then I was thinking about that time I jumped out of Earth orbit. ‘Taking the plunge’, you know?\nDOCTOR: Well, think about that then!\nFLIP: Except the time I jumped out of Earth orbit, I was thinking about that time in Scotland, with the Wirrn, when I crashed that stupid microlite on the ice.\nDOCTOR: So concentrate on that!\nFLIP: Only then, I was thinking about that time I got shot and killed by the Porcian leader — uh, Krarm! Krarn? No, Krarm. He was funny.\nDOCTOR: (FRUSTRATION) Fli-i-p!\nFLIP: Only when that happened — Oh! Yeah! (LAUGHS) I was thinking about that forest in Belgium. After Waterloo. The Forritt-des- Swines —\nDOCTOR: Forét de Soignes —\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 131\nFLIP: That’s the one. I’d left Jared in the Dalek pursuit ship, and gone off with you to see your TARDIS for the first time. And on the way, when I asked you what your TARDIS time machine looked like, you were being all cryptic and (SING-SONG) ‘I know something you don’t,’ like you were laughing to yourself —\nDOCTOR: I was not!\nFLIP: Whose memory is this - mine or yours? Yeah: smirking to yourself ‘cos you knew I was thinking it was gonna be like some shiny Star Wars spaceship doodah, when all it was was a blue box, and you couldn’t wait for me see it then walk in and go ‘O.M.G., it’s bigger on the inside than the out. O.M.G., O.M.G.,’ like a right idiot.\nFLIP: So when we finally got there, I thought I’d best play it cool, like Jared did the first time we met at the disco in the community centre, cos he didn’t want me to think he was an idiot, when he so obviously was — sorry, sorry, going off the point.\nFLIP: Aaanyway. That’s why, when you finally showed me inside the TARDIS, and it was bigger on the inside than the out — which was pretty amazeballs, I’ve got to admit — I just went (SARCASTIC) ‘Ooooo’ in, like, this ironic voice? Even though I was really going ‘O.M.G.’ inside. And me going ‘Ooo0oo’ like that put your nose so far out of joint that you disappeared off to watch cricket for, like, seven light years and — (BREAKS OFF) What are you looking at me like that for?\nDOCTOR: I’m not looking at you like anything.\nFLIP: Smirking! — This suit’s shut down, hasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Indeed it has. Well done, Flip.\nFLIP: It shut down ages ago, didn’t it? And you just let me carry on, like a proper nana!\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: Forgive me. I was trying to focus on my own thoughts.\nFLIP: I bet you were. What was it then, your memory?\nDOCTOR: Ah, that’s for me to know.\nFLIP: Oh, go on — was it something back from, what’s it called — Gallifrey?\nDOCTOR: Like I said. For me to know.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: SCENE 73: INT. SUBURBAN HALLWAY\nJANAIYA: At last. Oh Chloe — I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean any of that to happen...!\nCHLOE: Mum, it’s so good to see you.\nJANAIYA: You too, my dear!

Some fool at the End has ruined the whole experiment.\nVIOLET: (D) How?\nMIDDLEMAN: That can wait. The point is: the army knows everything. I’ve no choice but to abandon Formicia.\nVIOLET: (D) That is... disappointing. A hundred years of investment — for what?\nMIDDLEMAN: Well, the data I’ve gathered may yet prove invaluable...\nVIOLET: (D) Let’s hope so. Or we shall have to reconsider your future career.\nMIDDLEMAN: I’m on my way up to the surface.

All this isn’t over yet. We need to find Connie, for starters.\nCONSTANCE: (D) Doctor, Mrs Ramon — are you receiving me?\nDOCTOR: She appears to have found us. — Mrs Clarke! You’re in the Middle, I presume?\nCONSTANCE: (D) Indeed. The Middleman’s army has ground to a halt, thanks to my friend Mr York, and his daughter.\nFLIP: Livvy! Is Livvy there?\nCONSTANCE: (D) But as for the Middleman himself — he’s in his own suit, and by the looks of things he’s accessed a secret executive Litt.\nFLIP: You mean he’s getting away?\nCONSTANCE: (D) My suspicion is, he’s heading for the surface.\nDOCTOR: I thought the surface was off-limits?\nCONSTANCE: (D) So did everyone.\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 136\nFLIP: Right then.

You lot just needed to think you’d lost a generation, for... motivational reasons.\nDOCTOR: So what happened to them? The ‘lost generation’?\nMIDDLEMAN: Oh, they were given a sphere of their own, as an experiment. They’re still around here somewhere, I believe, the great- great-grandparents.

We owe the Doctor that much!\nYORK: I can’t lose you, Olivia — not now I’ve found you again!\nOLIVIA: Well, I could exactly say the same!\nCONSTANCE: I realise this is a moment of high emotion, but can the pair of you please agree on a course of action?\nYORK: Please, Mrs Clarke — take my daughter and go! I can operate the technology from here.\nOLIVIA: Yes, but you’ll need to break the Middleman’s firewall first. And I bet I can hack it faster than you!\nYORK: I... (DEFEATED) Yes, perhaps.\nCONSTANCE: Well, then — get a move on!\nCONSTANCE: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 145\nCONSTANCE: SCENE 82: EXT. SURFACE\nLIGHTLY: DOWN RAMP, FLANKED BY TWO HEAVY-BOOTED GUARDS.\nFLIP: Wow — what is she? Like, a teenager?\nDOCTOR: Apparently so.\nJANAIYA: And she’s in charge?\nVIOLET: Good afternoon, Middleman. I see you’ve brought some friends. Friends who will stand down immediately.\nJANAIYA: We’re not scared of your guards.\nDOCTOR: You should be. Those look like the weapons the Kronvos had.\nFLIP: You mean our suits are no protection?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nVIOLET: Well observed, old man. Who are you?\nMIDDLEMAN: Violet, this is the oaf who destroyed Formicia—\nVIOLET: Yes, thank you, Middleman. I’d concluded as much.\nMIDDLEMAN: Ma’am.\nVIOLET: (TO DOCTOR) Again: who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m not much at all. You can call me the Doctor.\nVIOLET: And what gives you the right, ‘Doctor’, to interfere in my business?\nVIOLET: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR: Oh! A business, is it?\nVIOLET: I’ve been managing these spheres for over thirty years.\nFLIP: Come again? You don’t look old enough to take driving lessons!\nVIOLET: Success brings with it the rewards of advanced physical renewal. Just ask the Middleman.\nJANAIYA: What? So how old is he really?\nMIDDLEMAN: That’s classified information.\nVIOLET: He’s seventy-five. Why hide it now? Nothing about your life matters now.\nJANAIYA: Seventy-five...?\nFLIP: Rumbled!\nJANAIYA: Seventy-five!! You should have been fighting alongside us... showing your courage?\nMIDDLEMAN: Sheep need shepherds. That’s the company motto.\nJANAIYA: I wish I had killed you now.\nFLIP: I don’t understand. How’s all this a business, anyhow?\nVIOLET: Formicia is one of forty research spheres buried in the crust of this planet. Forty new model worlds! We live in an expanding universe, with an expanding population. But sooner or later every civilisation comes to the same crunch: more and more people, sharing ever-fewer resources...\nDOCTOR: Food, money, energy — that sort of thing?\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 147\nVIOLET: Exactly. Shortages that can bring about total societal collapse, if one doesn’t manage one’s affairs with care. And if one can’t... well, that’s where we come in.\nDOCTOR: You’re.. management consultants!?!\nVIOLET: Of a sort. Create the right conditions, and you can remake society any way you want. Democratic, autocratic, oligarchic, gerontocratic. The possibilities are endless.\nMIDDLEMAN: In the case of Formicia, the experiment was to see if we could create a totally expendable, but totally willing warrior class.\nVIOLET: The holy grail! We’ve been trying to crack that one for centuries.\nDOCTOR: Well — in the case of Formicia, I’m afraid all you’ve done is create a fighting force strong enough to resist you.\nVIOLET: (LAUGHS) As if! I’1l1 tell you what’s going to happen, shall I? First I’m going to kill you. Then I’m going to kill your friends. Then I’m going to kill this useless Middleman.\nMIDDLEMAN: What?\nVIOLET: Just business. — And finally: I’m going to burn out the whole of Formicia with chemical weapons. Dissolving it, leaving the whole test sphere empty for a new population to be brought in.\nFLIP: But you can’t!!\nVIOLET: I can, you know. I’ve done it before.\nDOCTOR: (LOUDLY) And what about the Kronvos?\nVIOLET: The Kronvos?\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 148\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL)\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: SCENE 83: INT. MIDDLEMAN’S SUITE [CONTINUOUS ]\nDOCTOR: (D) Yes, (EVEN MORE EMPHATIC) what about the Kronvos?\nOLIVIA: That’s our cue.\nCONSTANCE: Now, Mr York!\nYORK: Done!\nYORK: Page\nYORK: 149\nYORK: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 150\nYORK: SCENE 84: EXT. SURFACE\nYORK: SCENE 19. THOUSANDS OF KRONVOS MATERIALISE ON THE SCENE.\nMIDDLEMAN: (TO VIOLET) The Kronvos! He’s got control of the entire Kronvos army!\nDOCTOR: Thanks to my friends in the Middle.\nVIOLET: The Kronvos are solid-state holograms. They’re not real.\nFLIP: The beams their guns shoot are.\nJANAIYA: We know that only too well.\nDOCTOR: (HOLLERING) Kronvos army — present arms!\nKRONVOS: ARMY [WILDTRACK] KRONVOS!!!\nDOCTOR: You appear to be outnumbered, Violet. Two thousand and three to, er, four. Now I’ve known some long odds in my time — but if I were you: I think I’d surrender.\nMIDDLEMAN: Violet? I think we should do as he says.\nVIOLET: I blame you for this, Middleman.\nDOCTOR: Splendid.\nFLIP: Wait - we’ve won?\nDOCTOR: It would seem so. Now — since we can’t return the way we came, I suggest we blast a hole in the cavern roof and fly Violet’s private jet back to Formicia. It looks rather luxurious.\nDOCTOR: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 151\nFLIP: Doctor, we can’t just leave! What about the Middleman, and Facelift Woman? And the End, and the Kronvos?\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s up to Janaiya.\nJANAIYA: Me?\nDOCTOR: I suggest you consult with the management here, and make them an offer they can’t refuse. The immediate liberation of all thirty-nine other colony spheres on this planet would seem to be an excellent starting-point.\nVIOLET: (LAUGHS) In exchange for me and this Middleman?\nMIDDLEMAN: The Board will never accept that.\nJANAIYA: In which case: we’ll just have to liberate the other thirty- nine spheres by force.\nMIDDLEMAN: What?\nJANAIYA: You made us, Middleman. Two armies: the army of the End, and the army of the Kronvos. You made us. You trained us. You armed us. And now we’re ready to fight — for freedom! (CALLING) Isn’t that right, Kronvos?\nKRONVOS: ARMY [WILDTRACK] KRONVOS!! KRONVOS!! KRONVOS!!\nKRONVOS: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 152\nKRONVOS: SCENE 85: EXT. ROOFTOP [LATER]\nTARDIS: LANDED. THE DOCTOR, FLIP AND CONSTANCE WALK INTO THE SCENE.\nFLIP: We’re not leaving already? Just as the party’s getting started?\nCONSTANCE: I’ve had my fill of this place, Philippa. Haven’t you?\nFLIP: But it’s your birthday, remember?\nCONSTANCE: That was yesterday, remember? What a pity, I seem to have missed it.\nFLIP: Yeah, I’1ll get you next year. You see that I don’t.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS, at last. Good to see you again, old girl.\nCONSTANCE: They won’t really have to go to war, will they? The people of Formicia?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. Our friend Violet’s in the social engineering business. A revolution in their own R and D lab isn’t exactly the best advertisement. If they’ve any sense, they’1l cut their losses and leave.\nFLIP: So they’re gonna get away with it? Violet, and the Middleman?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. But if it means that Janaiya, and Callum and Olivia York, and every other inhabitant of this poor benighted planet at last get to live their lives in the manner of their own choosing...\nFLIP: Suppose.\nFLIP: #232: THE MIDDLE by Chris Chapman (FINAL) Page 153\nCONSTANCE: Doctor, Flip, look — the Middle — it’s finally falling!\nDOCTOR: Good. This world needs to start again from the ground up. Like they say: “The End is the Beginning.” — Come along, Mrs Ramon,\nDOCTOR: Mrs Clarke.\nDOCTOR: DEMATERIALISES.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
