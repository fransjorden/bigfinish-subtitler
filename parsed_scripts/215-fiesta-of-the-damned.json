(BLUFFING) .. er, the town.\nNEWMAN: Farissa? [‘FA-REE-SA’] Small place, I don’t know it. We’ll be heading there ourselves now, I suspect, given we’ve got so many wounded. This part of the coast is mainly Republican, but Romero prefers to camp in the open. Any town or village becomes a target if we enter it.

You know the attack will come sooner or later but waiting for it is torture.\nMEL: (REALISING SHE MISREAD HIM) Sorry, I didn’t mean to seem rude.\nNEWMAN: No offence taken. It must be hard for a woman to understand.\nMEL: I beg your pardon?\nNEWMAN: Well, you know — war and fighting, it’s man’s business. The battlefield’s no place for a woman.\nACE: (AGGRESSIVELY) What did you say?\nNEWMAN: Er.. present company excepted?\nMEL: Don’t add to the casualties Ace, we’ve enough on our hands as Le Ass\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 14\nMEL: FX.

THE DOCTOR STOOPS DOWN TO LOOK INTO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND.\nHIS: VOICE NOW HAS A SLIGHT ECHO.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating, the bombing’s exposed a whole network of caves.\nROMERO: They must run all the way through the hillside.\nDOCTOR: I wonder how deep they are? — Pass me that stone.\nDOCTOR: FX. ROMERO SCRABBLES IN THE DIRT AND DOES SO. THE DOCTOR THROWS IT INTO THE CHASM, IT BOUNCES AND ECHOES.\nDOCTOR: Deep.\nROMERO: Deep enough. I lost a good man down there.\nDOCTOR: (CONTRITE) Yes, sorry, insensitive of me.\nROMERO: We’re at war, who has time for sensitivity?\nDOCTOR: Every life is precious. Every death a crime. What was his name, the man you lost?\nROMERO: Phillipe. We grew up in the same village. Played together, fished together... (BEAT) Killed together.\nDOCTOR: We choose what to remember and what to forget. That’s our right.\nROMERO: Then I’1l remember the fishing. And his guitar playing.\nROMERO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, I noticed the guitar. Before all this he was a musician?\nROMERO: In a fair world that’s all he would have been.\nDOCTOR: Oh to live in a fair world.\nROMERO: Some of us are trying to do just that.

Do you like bruises, or something?\nNEWMAN: (“EH?”) No...\nACE: Cos I thought you’d come over to check if I could keep the pace. Seeing as I’m a woman.\nNEWMAN: You’re an unusual one, that’s for sure.\nACE: You’re just asking for trouble now.\nNEWMAN: Trouble doesn’t bother me. I’ve had my fair share it over here.\nACE: As a reporter? Typewriter fights back, does it?\nNEWMAN: Yes, well — to tell you the truth, we’re not supposed to get involved in the fighting. It’s frowned upon. But I’ve always found it hard not to get involved.\nACE: (BEAT, A HINT OF WARMTH) Yeah, I know what you mean.\nNEWMAN: ‘A reporter must stay objective’, or so my editor tells me. But when you’re marching with good men, when the bullets start to fly.. well, you can’t just sit on your hands and hide behind your press credentials.\nACE: Even when it’s not your war?\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 17\nNEWMAN: Isn’t it? Just because I didn’t grow up here, am I supposed to be blind to my principles? I’m here, I’ve taken sides, it’s my war right enough.\nACE: And if the side you’ve picked starts to lose? What do you do then?\nNEWMAN: (QUIET) The Republicans are already losing. They sued for peace back in May but Franco was having none of it. He knew he could press his advantage home.\nACE: So they keep fighting.\nNEWMAN: To the last man, probably. That’s the cost of principles.\nCROSS TO ELSEWHERE IN THE LINE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 18\nCROSS TO ELSEWHERE IN THE LINE: FX. MARCHING.\nMEL: (QUIET) ‘A taste of the real Spain’?\nDOCTOR: A taste of the real Spain in the winter of 1938, certainly. (BEAT) I’m sorry I brought you here, Mel.\nMEL: I remember how it used to be with you. History hurts.\nDOCTOR: It can do, yes. It can also inspire. An opportunity to meet the guiding lights of human experience.\nMEL: Like Juan Romero?\nDOCTOR: (UNCERTAIN, WITH SADNESS) Possibly.\nMEL: Have you heard of him?\nDOCTOR: No.\nMEL: That doesn’t bode well.\nDOCTOR: We can’t all be famous. Even the footnotes are inspiring sometimes.\nMEL: He seems a good man.\nDOCTOR: In war? Is there such a thing?\nMEL: Isn’t that a bit rich coming from you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t say I was a good man either. Just another misguided fool trying his best.\nMEL: His men seem devoted to him, certainly.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: Yes, poor man. I hope his shoulders are broad enough to take the weight.\nROMERO: (SHOUTING IN THE DISTANCE) Brave heart my friends, not far now. We’ll soon be safe and sound.\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERING) If only...\nMEL: If only? (SIGHS) What exactly do you know?\nDOCTOR: (MOURNFUL) The future. That’s the trouble with history, it’s already been written.\nMEL: (QUIET) The Republicans lose, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes, they do. Badly.\nMEL: And here we are, getting involved as always.\nDOCTOR: As always.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: FX. FADE UP. THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL RINGING CONTINUOUSLY AS THE SOLDIERS REACH THE GATES OF FARISSA. ROMERO’S ARMY COMING TO A HALT.\nROMERO: Farissa, finally.. Seems like they saw us coming.\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER) Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Commander.\nROMERO: Hopefully we’1l be welcome.\nDOCTOR: And if not?\nROMERO: I have wounded, Doctor, and we’ve lost a lot of supplies.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) So you won’t take no for an answer. (DRY) Well, yes, let’s hope we are welcome then.\nROMERO: (SHOUTS) Hello! I am Juan Romero of the People’s Republican Army. I have men in need of shelter.\nROMERO: FX. THE TOLLING BELL CEASES.\nROMERO: Just beyond the gates there, someone’s coming out.\nDOCTOR: They’re sending people rather than bullets. I suppose that bodes well.\nCROSS TO ELSEWHERE IN THE LINE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 21\nNEWMAN: Hello, who’s this then?\nACE: If it’s a welcoming committee it doesn’t look too threatening, it’s wearing pyjamas.\nFERRANDO: (DISTANT, SHOUTED) I am Antonio Ruiz [ROO-EETH] Ferrando, mayor of Farissa. Juan Romero, your reputation precedes you.\nACE: Is that a good thing?\nNEWMAN: In Republican territory? You’d hope so. I suppose we’1ll find\nNEWMAN: out in a minute.\nCROSS BACK TO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 22\nCROSS BACK TO: FX. ROMERO APPROACHES FERRANDO\nROMERO: Senor Ferrando, I apologise for disturbing the peace of your town... and dragging you from your bed.\nFERRANDO: The bombs already did that. Lighting up the mountains like fiesta day.\nROMERO: They took us by surprise. It’s not normal to have enemy planes this deep in friendly territory.\nFERRANDO: The tide is turning, I fear. The Nationalists are growing bolder.\nROMERO: We’ll have to see what we can do about that. But first we need to gather our strength. The attack took its toll. Several of my men were wounded.\nFERRANDO: We don’t have much, but we’ll share it nonetheless. Tell your troops to enter with our blessing.\nROMERO: Thank you. We won’t outstay our welcome.\nFERRANDO: Our town is at your disposal.\nROMERO: Nonetheless, we will leave as soon as we can. I have no wish to make you a target.\nFERRANDO: (SIGHS) Let us be honest with one another. You already have, my friend.\nROMERO: These days, nowhere is safe.\nFERRANDO: And tonight, Farissa has learned that only too well.\nFERRANDO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 23\nFERRANDO: FX.

They’re terrified.\nDOCTOR: Not of the soldiers. Of what the soldiers may bring.\nDOCTOR: FX. ACE AND NEWMAN RUN UP TO JOIN THEM.\nNEWMAN: They should be safe. The Nationalists don’t make a habit of bombing towns this close to Valencia, they have bigger targets there.\nACE: Tell that to the bloke who was dropping the bombs earlier.\nNEWMAN: Honestly, it’s rare. Franco is still trying to curry favour with the common man. This is a war fought with propaganda as much as bombs.\nMEL: For their sake I hope you’re right.\nNEWMAN: For all our sakes.\nNEWMAN: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 25\nNEWMAN: FX. ROMERO AND FERRANDO WALKING ALONG, ROMERO’S MEN FOLLOWING BEHIND.\nFERRANDO: Space is limited, but we can fit your men in the church.\nROMERO: We'd be happy just camping in the square.\nFERRANDO: The least we can offer is a roof.\nFERRANDO: FX.

FERRANDO AND ROMERO ENTER, COMING TO A HALT JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY.\nFERRANDO: We have a little more space in the town hall, if this isn’t enough. But this is God’s house, and it should be a place of refuge.\nROMERO: Perhaps the wounded can be billeted in the town hall? It’s as well they have their own space, so that... (TRAILS OFF, HE\nREALISES: IT’S BEST NOT TO GIVE A FULL EXPLANATION)\nFERRANDO: (UNDERSTANDING ANYWAY) So that their cries don’t disturb the rest of your men? I may just be a small town official, Senor Romero, but I’m not entirely fragile.\nROMERO: I meant no disrespect.\nFERRANDO: I’m no stranger to death. I lost my son to the war, he died in Galicia.\nROMERO: My condolences.\nFERRANDO: Thank you. So you understand when I say that what I’m doing is not kindness, it’s duty. I may not be fighting in the war but I will do what I can. If we clear the pews there should be room for your men to bed down.\nROMERO: This is luxury compared to our usual camp, I assure you. I’1l have my men clear the space. (SHOUTS) Jorge [HOR-HEY], Daniel [DAN-EE-ELL], gather a party to shift the furniture. Carefully, remember we’re guests.\nROMERO: FX. 2 x MEN RUN FORWARD, START TO SHIFT THE PEWS.\nFERRANDO: Now, if you will forgive me, I will return to my bed.\nROMERO: Of course, sleep well.\nFERRANDO: I will try, but rarely do.\nFERRANDO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 27\nFERRANDO: FX. FERRANDO EXITS.\nROMERO: That’s it, clear it all right back. Jorge? Let’s have the field radio set up at the back, once we’re clear you can call in our position.\nROMERO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 28\nROMERO: FX. THE WHIRRING OF CICADAS. THEY STOP, SILENCE, THEN THE LIVING-DEAD PHILLIPE DRAGS HIMSELF PAST US.\nPHILLIPE: FX. PHILLIPE FADES OUT. BEAT. CICADAS RESUME.\nPHILLIPE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 29\nPHILLIPE: FX. THE DOCTOR, ACE & MEL ARE SAT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH, WE CAN HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF PEWS BEING SHIFTED INSIDE.\nACE: Shouldn’t we be helping clear the place?\nDOCTOR: They can manage, best not to interfere in history.\nMEL: (SARCASTIC) Especially when it involves heavy lifting?\nDOCTOR: Yes, especially then.\nMEL: So, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A few years ago, a group of conservative generals declared a coup on the democratic government.\nDOCTOR: Under the leadership of José Sanjurjo [SAN-HUR-HO], yes.\nACE: Hang on, I thought they were led by Franco?\nDOCTOR: Sanjurjo died in a plane crash returning from exile. He was carrying too much luggage.\nMEL: Luggage?\nDOCTOR: It was a small plane, it couldn’t take the weight.\nMEL: (INCREDULOUS) So why did he pack it all?\nDOCTOR: He said it was important he looked impressive when he took power.\nACE: Death by vanity. Right. Even dictators like a nice suit. So then Franco took over?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 30\nMEL: But what are they actually fighting about?\nDOCTOR: The usual. Politics and religion. The Nationalists believed the Republicans were destabilising the country, eradicating Catholic values, flirting with communism... blah blah...\nMEL: And the Republicans?\nDOCTOR: The Republicans believe a country should be run democratically, fairer hours for the working man, a move towards a secular government...\nACE: So the Republicans are the good guys?\nDOCTOR: In war there’s no such thing. They’ve both committed their share of atrocities.\nMEL: But they’re better than the Nationalists?\nDOCTOR: (NOT WANTING TO COMMIT) Perhaps.\nACE: It doesn’t matter anyway, right? The Nationalists win?\nDOCTOR: The Battle of the Ebro River has just been fought. Tens of thousands of dead on both sides. It was the deciding battle, the Republicans never recover.\nACE: They’re on the run.\nDOCTOR: Withdrawing to their safe territories, yes. In a few months those territories will fall. Catalonia, Tarragona, Barcelona...\nMEL: Valencia?\nDOCTOR: One of the very last to fall. The Republicans will once more try and negotiate a peace, but Franco will only accept an unconditional surrender.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 31\nACE: And they give it to him.\nDOCTOR: What choice will they have?\nMEL: What happens then? To people like Romero?\nDOCTOR: Some escape to other countries. Many are executed, at least thirty thousand.\nMEL: Thirty thousand?\nDOCTOR: At least. It depends who you believe. Other estimates creep as high as two hundred thousand.\nMEL: That’s.. (CAN’T THINK OF A STRONG ENOUGH WORD)\nDOCTOR: War, Mel.\nACE: And Franco takes over Spain.\nDOCTOR: And rules it for thirty-six years, until his death in nineteen seventy-five.\nACE: It worked out quite well for him, then.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nMEL: So there’s no point in anything Romero and his men do?\nDOCTOR: Of course there’s a point. We all have to die someday, it’s how we live that matters. On the subject of which...\nDOCTOR: FX. GETS TO HIS FEET.\nDOCTOR: I’m going to see what I can do about the wounded.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 32\nACE: And what do you want us to do?\nDOCTOR: Whatever you like, just be careful...\nDOCTOR: FX. HE WALKS OFF.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: FX. FERRANDO ENTERS HIS STUDY. CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.\nFERRANDO: Peace at last. Oh to close my front door on all of the world’s troubles. And to keep it closed.\nFERRANDO: FX. UNSCREWS A BOTTLE, POURS HIMSELF A DRINK.\nFERRANDO: Alfredo my boy, why will you never hang straight?\nFERRANDO: FX. HE SHIFTS A PICTURE ON THE WALL.\nFERRANDO: Blame Dolores, eh son? She never puts the pictures back properly after she cleans.\nFERRANDO: FX. TAKES A SIP OF HIS DRINK.\nFERRANDO: Or perhaps it’s just the weight of your medals, eh? Pulling you down to one side? (BEAT) Much good they did you. The war has come knocking on our door. Juan Romero, the hero, the living legend. (BEAT) One of the lucky ones, one of the few still alive.\nFERRANDO: FX. ANOTHER SIP.\nFERRANDO: But for how long I wonder? How long for any of us? They’re winning Alfredo. In fact they’ve probably already won, the rest of us just haven’t had the common sense to lie down and die yet. So what was the point? What was any of it for?\nFERRANDO: FX. DRAINS HIS DRINK.\nFERRANDO: No hero’s death for any of us, my son, just names on a ledger. Enemies of the state. To hell with us all.\nFERRANDO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 34\nFERRANDO: FX. THE DOCTOR WALKING BETWEEN BEDS.\nWOUNDED MAN: FX. THE DOCTOR STOPS BY HIS SIDE.\nDOCTOR: Peace now, run away to dreams.\nDOCTOR: FX. SILENCE FALLS.\nDOCTOR: That’s it, sleep, the best thing.\nDOCTOR: FX. ROMERO ENTERS\nROMERO: Doctor? How are my men?\nDOCTOR: Malnourished, fatigued, on the brink of collapse. (BEAT) And as for the wounded...\nROMERO: The war takes its toll.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. I’ve done what I can. Not enough. I haven’t the facilities to do more than be kind. Sadly, kindness doesn’t heal third-degree burns.\nROMERO: I appreciate your efforts, as I’m sure do they.\nDOCTOR: I wish I could help more.\nROMERO: I know. I can see it in your eyes. You wear your heart on your sleeve, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Few would agree with you there.\nROMERO: Perhaps they didn’t trouble themselves to look deeply enough?\nDOCTOR: Or perhaps they looked deeper. You should be resting.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 35\nROMERO: I should, but I can’t sleep. It won’t kill me.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be so sure.\nROMERO: When I die, Doctor, it’ll be from something considerably more painful than tiredness. (BEAT) What were you and your friends doing on the mountainside?\nDOCTOR: Running for our lives, the same as you.\nROMERO: Perhaps. Oh, don’t worry Doctor, I don’t think you’re my enemy. But you’re not with the Republican army either, are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m not with anyone’s army.\nROMERO: A pacifist?\nDOCTOR: It’s a noble ideal.\nROMERO: Indeed. I wish we lived in a world where one could afford to hold it. — Good night, Doctor. Thank you again for your help.\nROMERO: Follow your own advice and get some sleep.\nDOCTOR: I’ve never been very good at that.\nROMERO: Following your own advice, or sleeping?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Good night.\nROMERO: (SLIGHT LAUGH) Good night.\nROMERO: FX. HE LEAVES.\nROMERO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 36\nROMERO: FX.

Though in a time of wat...\nMEL: Surely that’s when you pacifism comes to the fore.\nROMERO: You and Ace, you’re pacifists too?\nMEL: Oh, I don’t know... Ace wouldn’t say so.\nROMERO: Yes, she seems to have a fire in her.\nMEL: That’s one way of putting it.\nROMERO: And you?\nMEL: I’m lucky. I’ve never had to decide one way or the other, really.\nROMERO: Even now? Lucky indeed.\nTHE: not\nTHE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 38\nMEL: I’ve...

Besides, life doesn’t allow us to be all one thing or another does it?\nROMERO: I’m a soldier, nothing more.\nMEL: I don’t believe it, what did you do before the war?\nROMERO: I was a farmer.\nMEL: There you go, then. You still are, deep down. One day you’1l go back to growing things again.\nROMERO: You really believe that?\nMEL: I’d like to.\nROMERO: So would I. But in the meantime I’1ll carry on being a soldier.\nROMERO: FX. THERE’S A LOUD, ALIEN SCREAM IN THE DISTANCE. A BIRDLIKE SCREECH.

Someone check the mayor, the blast caught him more than me.\nDOCTOR: FX. ROMERO CHECKS FERRANDO.\nROMERO: Ferrando? Antonio?\nFERRANDO: (GROGGY) That creature... like something from Hell. A Cuélebre!

(SNAPPING FINGERS) Mayor Ferrando? — Mayor Ferrando! Can you hear me?\nFERRANDO: (GROGGY) What happened?\nACE: An alien blew up, knocking you flying. Then it turned into soldier boy over there.\nFERRANDO: (BEAT, STILL GROGGY) Are you quite sure it’s me who’s concussed?\nNEWMAN: Let’s get you to your feet, shall we?\nNEWMAN: NEWMAN/ACE:\nROMERO: It is Phillipe. I don’t understand.\nMEL: None of us do, Juan. Give the Doctor time.\nDOCTOR: I need the body somewhere safe. Somewhere I can examine it properly.\nROMERO: (PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) There’s a crypt beneath the church.\nDOCTOR: Well, then — see to it, Commander.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: FX.

Besides, everyone’s going spare so I thought I'd see what was happening.\nDOCTOR: Not much. This poor man is exactly what he seems to be — a dead human being. Nothing more, nothing less.\nACE: So how come he changed?\nDOCTOR: I wish I knew.\nACE: The Mayor called him a funny name. A ‘cooey libra’?\nDOCTOR: A Cuélebre. A creature from Spanish mythology. Lives in caves. Eats people.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 48\nACE: Yeah. That.\nDOCTOR: He’s not.\nACE: Well I know that, don’t I? I’ve been around, seen a bit of the universe. That lot up there, though? They’ve gone Grimm’s Fairy Tales about it all.\nDOCTOR: They’re just trying to understand.

Always had chocolate spread for breakfast when I was on holiday in Spain. (BEAT) And lunch. (BEAT) And dinner.\nMEL: It’s very unhealthy.\nACE: What, chocolate spread?\nMEL: All this oil. (BEAT) And chocolate spread.\nACE: Want me to see if they’1ll do you a smoothie? A really nice one\nACE: filled with spinach and tears?\nDOCTOR: Eat your toast. Both of you.\nDOCTOR: FX.

HE PULLS UP A CHAIR.\nROMERO: Have you finished examining Phillipe, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I have, and I’m afraid I’ve learned nothing.\nROMERO: (SIGHS) I cannot begin to understand. The townspeople are full of superstitious chatter.\nMEL: You can hardly blame them.\nROMERO: I suppose not but it won’t be long before Ferrando asks us to leave.\nNEWMAN: It’s hardly our fault.\nROMERO: I’1ll let you try to convince him of that, shall I? Right now we're the strangers who brought a monster to their town.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll speak to the Mayor.\nROMERO: Thank you, but he has no reason to trust you either.\nDOCTOR: People rarely do, yet somehow I manage.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 52\nACE: Or get locked up.\nDOCTOR: (IRRITATED) Yes, thank you, Ace.\nMEL: Or shot at.\nDOCTOR: (EVEN MORE IRRITATED) Yes, thank you, Mel.\nACE: (LOOKING DOWN ROAD) Hello.

JEERING CONTINUES UNDER THE FOLLOWING.\nLUIS: Yes, I know — they don’t like it but we’ve got to eat somehow haven’t we? (BEAT) I know, I know — you’d send us food if you could, but you don’t like to interfere. I wish you would. (BEAT) Yes, sorry, I shouldn’t argue, forget I mentioned it. (TO THE CROWD) Please, my friends! I wish only for some food, anything you can spare!\nLUIS: FX. THE JEERING INTENSIFIES. PEOPLE START THROWING THINGS.\nLUIS: Throw the food if you must! I’m not proud, just hungry!\nLUIS: FX. ACE COMES RUNNING.\nACE: Oi! What’s he done to you then?\nACE: FX. HALF A CABBAGE HITS HER.\nACE: Watch it, you! That hit me.\nLUIS: Cabbage? Lovely. It’s a bit past its best but I’1l1 happily unburden you of it.\nLUIS: FX. THE DOCTOR, ROMERO, MEL AND NEWMAN JOIN THEM.\nROMERO: You people, stop that! (JEERING CONTINUES) I said —\nROMERO: FX. HE FIRES HIS GUN INTO THE AIR.\nROMERO: Stop that!\nROMERO: FX. CROWD FALLS SILENT.\nROMERO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 54\nROMERO: Go back to your homes, I shall escort our visitor out of town.\nTOWNSPERSON: (SHOUTS) Make sure you do! We’ve enough problems without his disease.\nACE: Disease?\nROMERO: (SHOUTING) Back to your homes!\nROMERO: FX. DISGRUNTLED, THE TOWNSFOLK DISPERSE.\nMEL: Doctor — what did they mean, ‘disease’?\nDOCTOR: I believe this unfortunate gentleman to be suffering from a chronic condition characterised by lesions of the skin. Properly known as Hansen’s Disease.\nLUIS: Not that I know of. My name is Luis. I, sir, ama leper.\nDOCTOR: An archaic label.\nLUIS: Whatever it is, it makes me unpopular.\nACE: Someone’s going to get a slap if they start throwing things again.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) It’s a different time, Ace. Leprosy isn’t very contagious, but many people still think it is.\nMEL: They’re afraid?\nACE: That’s no excuse.\nMEL: Ace. We can’t fight a whole town’s ignorance.\nACE: I’ll happily try if they push it.\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 55\nROMERO: (TO LUIS) Come on, friend, let’s get you out of here before the people turn nasty again. You picked a bad time to visit.\nLUIS: There isn’t a good time when you’re.. as I am. That’s my experience anyway. My friends and I don’t normally call on our neighbours but... well, times are hard and bellies are empty.\nACE: Do you like toast?\nDOCTOR: Ace!\nACE: I mean it, he can have my toast.\nMEL: And mine.\nROMERO: Wait here. We have few supplies, but we’1ll spare what we can.\nMEL: I’1ll help you, Juan.\nMEL: FX. MEL AND ROMERO EXIT.\nLUIS: You’re all very kind. (TALKING TO HIMSELF AGAIN) Aren’t they kind? I know! It is rare. (BEAT) Oh, well — trust you to take the credit, you would say you sent them, wouldn’t you?\nACE: Who are you talking to?\nLUIS: Hmm? Oh! Our Lord, of course. I’ve got into the habit, no-one else seems to listen.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: FX. GATES CREAK OPEN (FROM INSIDE). ROMERO HANDS LUIS A SMALL BAG OF FOOD.\nROMERO: Here, my friend. Stale bread, olives, a little cheese. Marching rations.\nLUIS: Are you sure, Captain?\nROMERO: It’s only marching rations. But we may rely on the generosity of the townsfolk, whereas you...\nLUIS: I’m sure they are generous, deep down.\nMEL: (TO LUIS) Is it far, your village?\nLUIS: It’s not a village — more of a commune, really. It’s a couple of miles away. Place called Esperanza. It’s quite nice, we have a water mill and a river you can swim in. We used to have a hospital but that’s all closed down now.\nMEL: Were the staff dragged into the war?\nLUIS: Oh, probably, they didn’t say, just packed up their white coats and their equipment and drove off one morning. Maybe they’1l be back. — But I have detained you long enough. Thank you, my friends. God be with you.\nLUIS: FX. LUIS WALKS OFF.\nMEL: (CALLING AFTER) And you! (TO ROMERO) That was good of you, Juan. Sparing those rations.\nROMERO: We fight for all of Spain, not just those fortunate enough to have good health. I just hope I’m right, that the townsfolk will show us more kindness than they did friend Luis.\nMEL: They won’t kick you out, surely?\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 57\nROMERO: After what happened last night... (DESPAIRING) Oh, I just don’t know what to think. It must have been an illusion of some kind, maybe the Nationalists are using some kind of gas...\nMEL: I think there’s a bit more to it than that.\nROMERO: There must be a logical explanation. Phillipe can’t have been dead. He managed to climb out of the pit, walk as far as the town...\nMEL: (SARCASTIC) And then turned into a weird, bird, lizard monster?\nROMERO: (ANGRY) I don’t know! (CALMS HIMSELF) I believe in monsters, Mel, I’ve faced many in my life... (BEAT) But they were all human.\nMEL: I’ve seen things, Juan, things just as strange, just as... alien as that creature last night. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes.\nROMERO: (SARCASTIC) You’re sounding like the townspeople. You think we’re dealing with a Cuélebre as well?\nMEL: Of course not. (BEAT) Well, probably not. I’m not talking about myths and legends, Juan, I’m talking about reality. There are strange things in the universe.\nMEL: FX. THEY STOP WALKING.\nROMERO: I can’t help but think I’m looking at one of them now. Who are\nROMERO: you, Mel?\nMEL: (BEAT) A friend. Someone who just wants to help. (BEAT) Come on, let’s see if the Doctor’s figured out anything useful.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 58\nMEL: FX. ACE IS SAT ALONE, NEWMAN APPROACHES\nNEWMAN: Hello, old thing. Waiting for morning prayers?\nACE: You what?\nNEWMAN: It’s a church, you know, praying tends to be popular.\nACE: Not with me.\nNEWMAN: (SIGHS) Excuse me for asking. (BEAT; BRIGHTLY) Fancy stretching your legs?\nACE: I fancy beating up some people.\nNEWMAN: I can’t help with that, but I can offer you a trip out of town. I dropped my camera in the bombing, you see, and I’m heading back to the camp to see if I can find it. Want to come with?\nACE: Yeah, alright. (GETTING UP) Anything’s better than hanging around here.\nNEWMAN: I’m glad my company’s such a draw.\nACE: (GOOD HUMOURED) I’m coming, aren’t I?\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 59\nACE: FX. KNOCK ON DOOR.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Hello? Senor Ferrando?\nDOCTOR: FX. HE KNOCKS AGAIN.\nDOCTOR: I Just wanted to talk to you about a few things. You know... (UNCERTAIN. NOW TO HIMSELF) Alien creatures wandering about, that sort of thing...\nDOCTOR: (CONCERNED) Senor Ferrando?\nDOCTOR: FX. DOCTOR PUSHES DOOR. FOLLOW HIM HE ENTERS ROOM.\nFERRANDO: (COMES TO; SLURRED) What? Who is it? (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Sorry to barge in. Are you alright? You sound... unwell~\nFERRANDO: (SLURRED) Asleep. Not myself.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I can help?\nFERRANDO: (SLURRED) No, just need... peace and quiet. (HARD) Leave.\nDOCTOR: Maybe I should just give you a quick once-over? I’m medically trained. (TO HIMSELF) I seem to remember.\nFERRANDO: (SUDDENLY ANGRY) Leave!\nDOCTOR: Very well. If you’re sure.\nDOCTOR: FX. HE WALKS OUT. BEAT.\nFERRANDO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 60\nFERRANDO: FX. THE DOCTOR STEPPING OUT OF FERRANDO’S HOUSE.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Can it be? Could they have seeded this far out?\nDOCTOR: FX. ROMERO AND MEL APPROACH.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Hello, Mel. Commander.\nROMERO: Something wrong, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Senor Ferrando, he’s... (EXASPERATED) Oh, this is all such a mess!\nMEL: There’s something wrong with Ferrando?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Or maybe I do. I hope not. Where’s Ace?\nROMERO: We just passed her and Senor Newman.\nMEL: He dropped his camera last night, they’ve gone to try and find it at the old camp.\nDOCTOR: (SUDDENLY SHARP) They’ve gone back there? That’s the last place they should be!\nDOCTOR: FX. BEGINS TO RUN OFF.\nMEL: Doctor? Where are you going?\nMEL: FX. THE DOCTOR RUNS BACK.\nDOCTOR: Stay here. Keep an eye on Ferrando. He may be in danger. Or\nDOCTOR: dangerous. Or both.\nMEL: Dangerous?\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: Stay here!\nDOCTOR: FX. RUNS OFF AGAIN.\nMEL: (CALLING) Doctor!\nMEL: FX. HE STOPS. COMES BACK. DIGGING IN HIS POCKETS.\nDOCTOR: Wait. I’m sure it’s in here somewhere... Aha!\nMEL: A toy dinosaur?\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING OFF) Use it to stay in touch!\nROMERO: What does he mean, use it to stay in touch?\nROMERO: FX. MEL FIDDLES WITH IT, A CRACKLE OF RADIO STATIC.\nMEL: Ah. It’s a walkie-talkie. A plastic dinosaur walkie-talkie!\nROMERO: I have no idea what that is.\nROMERO: FX. SHE SHOVES IT IN HER POCKET.\nMEL: Doesn’t matter. He said to keep an eye on Ferrando, so that’s what we need to do.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 62\nMEL: FX. ACE AND NEWMAN WALKING ALONG.\nACE: So — you been in many wars, then, George?\nNEWMAN: (BEAT) What a strange question... I served on the Italian Front in 1917. Not many since then, thankfully.\nACE: But you enjoy it.\nNEWMAN: (SHOCKED) Enjoy?\nACE: OK, maybe that’s the wrong word but you’re thrilled by it. Some people couldn’t bear to be here... but you? I think you thrive oft 1\nNEWMAN: (BEAT. THEN AN HONEST REPLY.) Maybe a little.\nACE: Where I come from we have an expression for that: adrenaline junkie.\nNEWMAN: Junkie? And what do you mean ‘where I come from’? You’re as British as I am.\nACE: Perivale. Local expression. Junkie means addict.\nNEWMAN: Addicted to adrenalin. (SIGHS) Perhaps. I’ve seen terrible things, done terrible things... and yet, back in London, reporting on empty, trifling stories.. I felt, empty somehow. Adrift.\nACE: I know what you mean. I’ve seen amazing stuff travelling with the Doctor, but some of it was horrible. If you asked me to stop though, to go back to my boring life back home...\nNEWMAN: You couldn’t do it.\nACE: And I never will.\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 63\nNEWMAN: What we saw last night, everyone else was panicking but you... You were excited.\nACE: SO were you.\nNEWMAN: I was intrigued.\nACE: You were excited. Because it was something different, something\nACE: unknown.\nNEWMAN: (ACCEPTING IT) Those are the things a journalist lives for.\nACE: (TRIUMPHANT) Because you’re an adrenaline junkie!\nNEWMAN: Just like you.\nACE: (WITH A BIG GRIN) Definitely!\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 64\nACE: FX. LUIS IS WALKING ALONG, HEADING BACK TO HIS OWN VILLAGE, TALKING TO HIMSELF AS USUAL.\nLUIS: Yes, yes, they were very nice. Very nice indeed. And at least I’m not going home empty-handed. (BEAT) No, I know it’s not much but we’ll manage. (BEAT) Yes, we’ll get by. Hello...\nLUIS: FX. HE PUTS DOWN THE FOOD, PEERING INTO THE CAVERN.\nLUIS: (CONT.) (SLIGHT ECHO): Love a good cave. Fun things to poke around in, caves...\nLUIS: FX. LUIS SCRABBLES AT LOOSE DIRT.\nLUIS: (CONT. ) (SLIGHT ECHO):\nLUIS: Look at that! Even more opened up after all those bombs. Whole mountainside will probably fall in before long. Unstable. (BEAT) Yes. I know, bombs are very horrible. Caves are interesting though don’t you think? (BEAT) Oh. Well, I (think they are) AHH!!\nLUIS: FX. HE SLIPS, FALLING INTO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND. LOTS OF\nRUSHING: DEBRIS, A FEW MORE SCREAMS THEN HE COMES TO A HALT. THERE’S THE SOUND OF ELECTRONIC POWER. THE SAME PULSING HEARD IN SCENE 22.\nLUIS: (SPITS OUT DIRT)You did that on purpose, just because I disagreed. Ooh... What are these? Like grapefruit... glowing grapefruit... I wonder if you can eat...\nLUIS: FX. DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY.\nLUIS: Ahh! !\nLUIS: FX.

We mislaid her in the bombing, same as your camera.\nNEWMAN: It’s a bit bigger than my camera.\nACE: Yeah, well, there was dust and bombs and ‘boom!’ so we got a bit turned around.\nNEWMAN: Fell out of your pocket did it?\nACE: Just don’t worry about it! Get looking for your camera.\nNEWMAN: I am, no sign of anything though...\nACE: Maybe it fell into one of the caves.\nACE: FX. SHE STOOPS DOWN TO LOOK INTO ONE OF THE HOLES.\nACE: (ECHOES) Hello!\nNEWMAN: If it did it’s likely in pieces.\nACE: I can see something shining down there.\nNEWMAN: Shining?\nACE: Glowing... like.. (EXASPERATED) I don’t know, like a glowy thing.\nNEWMAN: Have you ever considered a career in journalism?\nACE: No. You ever considered a career in potholing?\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 66\nNEWMAN: I don’t even know what that is.\nACE: I’1l show you.\nACE: FX.

Except sit there and watch that front door.\nROMERO: (BEAT) You are a very annoying woman.\nMEL: Apparently. So you’re going to stay here then, yes?\nROMERO: (SIGHS) For a little longer.\nMEL: Did you like being a farmer?\nROMERO: What a strange question.\nMEL: I didn’t want to ask whether you liked being a soldier.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 68\nROMERO: Yes, I liked being a farmer. It meant I spent most of my day on my own, out in the fields, lost in my thoughts. Peaceful.\nMEL: Not much peace for you now.\nROMERO: In any sense of the word. But that’s why we fight isn’t it? So that one day we can all go back to the quiet fields.\nROMERO: FX. FROM INSIDE FERRANDO’S HOUSE, A CRASHING SOUND.\nMEL: What was that?\nROMERO: Something I’m sure the Doctor would want us to investigate.\nMEL: Definitely.\nMEL: FX. THEY HEAD TOWARDS FERRANDO’S HOUSE.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 69\nMEL: FX. ACE AND NEWMAN DROP DOWN FROM THE LADDER, ECHOES, TRICKLING OF DIRT AND ROCK. THEY WALK AROUND INSIDE THE CAVE.\nACE: How far do you think the caves stretch on for?\nNEWMAN: Who knows? Could be miles. I wish we had a torch.\nACE: Look over there, we won’t need one.\nNEWMAN: Glowing light. Blue. Electric?\nACE: Not your camera then.\nNEWMAN: No. You think it’s something the plane dropped? Some new form of weapon?\nACE: (SARCASTIC) A new form of weapon that fell into the earth, grew legs and then burrowed off deeper into the caves?\nNEWMAN: (DEFENSIVE) Who knows? People get very creative in wartime.\nACE: True, and to be fair I’ve seen weirder things. Not in this time period though, and not invented by Spanish Nationalists. Whatever that is, I think the bombs uncovered it.\nNEWMAN: “Time period”?\nACE: Another local Perivale expression.\nNEWMAN: So you think this is something to do with what happened last night? The monster thing?\nACE: Bit of a coincidence otherwise.\nNEWMAN: (WITH A BIG GRIN) Shall we take a look?\nNEWMAN: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 70\nACE: Try and stop me.\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 71\nACE: FX.

Come on.\nROMERO: Wait. ‘In danger or dangerous’, that’s what the Doctor said.\nMEL: So?\nROMERO: If he’s dangerous we need to be cautious.\nMEL: You’re used to dangerous things, you’re a soldier.\nROMERO: One who’s still alive because he knows when to charge in and when to approach carefully. Stay behind me.\nMEL: I’m not some delicate flower that needs protecting. Come on, we’ll go together.\nMEL: FX.

They’re nearly extinct.\nACE: Yeah, so were we.\nNEWMAN: At least we got out with this.\nDOCTOR: Oh?\nNEWMAN: Some strange globe. Found it in the tunnels.\nNEWMAN: FX. HE UNWRAPS THE SPHERE, WE CAN HEAR IT PULSE VERY FAINTLY.\nDOCTOR: (PANIC) Ah! Drop it! Quickly!\nDOCTOR: FX. HE BEGINS PATTING HIS POCKETS. NEWMAN DROPS THE SPHERE.

We don’t want to make a phone call!\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, it’s slightly illegal actually. It siphons energy from nearby sources to boost your battery.\nDOCTOR: FX. THE PULSING OF THE SPHERE, ALREADY FAINT, STOPS ALTOGETHER. THE BEEPING STOPS AS THE DOCTOR TURNS OFF HIS CHARGER.\nDOCTOR: Terribly useful in an emergency, though. I could get hours of extra call time now.\nNEWMAN: The sphere’s stopped glowing.\nDOCTOR: Completely drained of energy. It’s inert. Should be safe.\nACE: But what is it?\nDOCTOR: Some species call it a God Seed.\nACE: Very dramatic.\nDOCTOR: A lot of species are. It’s a genetic seeding device.\nNEWMAN: (SARCASTIC) Oh good, glad that’s sorted out then.\nDOCTOR: Nobody knows when they were first created, it’s so long ago, but they were sent out on the winds of the universe...\nACE: Like dandelion seeds?\nDOCTOR: Well, not quite. There’s a control unit as well as the seeds themselves, they divide on landing.\nNEWMAN: We didn’t see a control unit. (BEAT) What does a control unit look like?\nNEWMAN: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR: Do you want me to explain or not?\nNEWMAN: Sorry old chap.\nDOCTOR: They land on other planets, waiting to be activated.\nNEWMAN: (SHOCKED) Other planets?\nACE: Where did you think our Cooey Libra came from?

I wish I still had my gun.\nMEL: sorry.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR: They absorb the DNA of the resident lifeforms, add it to their own and create a new species, a hybrid.\nACE: That’s why that thing looked like such a mess? A bit bird, a bit lizard...\nDOCTOR: And now a bit human. A piece of Phillipe’s consciousness and DNA, now Mayor Ferrando... No hatching is the same. A constantly shifting, mutating species.\nNEWMAN: But why?\nACE: Great way to invade. No space ships or battles, just a viral infection.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. It creates a handful of initial hybrids as a spearhead.\nACE: An army of patient zeroes.\nDOCTOR: If you like. They spread the infection through touch.\nDOCTOR: Each world is fully-converted, the original dominant life-form absorbed. And then...\nACE: It sends more seeds off to the next planet?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) But they were thought to have been eradicated millennia ago.\nNEWMAN: Clearly not.\nDOCTOR: There was a universe-wide purge. By.. well, by a very powerful race.\nACE: A time-travelling one that normally bangs on about not interfering?\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR: The High Council decided it had no choice. If left to flourish they foresaw a time when the entire universe would be seeded.\nACE: Well they didn’t do a very good job, did they? Otherwise we wouldn’t be looking at this thing now.\nNEWMAN: (RUSTLE OF PAPER AS HE TURNS A PAGE IN HIS NOTEBOOK) And what were these creatures called?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you could pronounce the High Gallif— [reyan] (SURPRISED) Mr Newman! Are you taking notes?\nNEWMAN: I’m a reporter, of course I’m taking notes.\nACE: It’s the invasion of the Cooey Libras!\nDOCTOR: (CORRECTING HER, AS ALWAYS) Cuélebre! But it’s as good a name as any, I suppose.\nNEWMAN: So how can they control the wildlife?\nDOCTOR: They can dominate and control most things, but less intelligent lifeforms are easier.\nACE: Better watch out, George.\nNEWMAN: Well, thank you very much!\nDOCTOR: The control unit must be low on power. Hardly surprising considering how long it’s probably been buried.\nNEWMAN: Until the bombs disturbed it.\nDOCTOR: The kinetic energy may even have activated it. They’re very resourceful, they can convert most things into a viable power resource.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 96\nACE: So what are we going to do then?\nDOCTOR: (THINKS FOR A MOMENT) If it’s that low on power I can probably drain the rest. Render the whole thing inert.\nACE: Back to the bat cave!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and if I’m quick it may also knock out our infected mayor,\nDOCTOR: which should keep Mel safe.\nACE: Come on then!

THE CRACKLE AND WHINE OF THE RADIO AS HE POWERS IT UP (OLD\nVALVES: ETC).\nROMERO: Hello, this is Farissa calling Nationalist forces. Farissa calling Nationalist forces. Republican commander Juan Romero is hiding in the town with the full support of the locals. Last night’s bomb raid caused minimal casualties. A further strike would wipe out both him and his men. This is an opportunity for a major Nationalist victory. Suggest bombing raid ordered as soon as possible. Map reference to follow...\nROMERO: FX. HE PULLS OUT A MAP.\nROMERO: (TO HIMSELF) Who would have thought I’d be banking on the Nationalists to save the country?

Are you alright, George?\nNEWMAN: Fine. Brilliant. Stupendous. Possibly drunk?\nACE: It takes a bit of getting used to.\nACE: FX. THE DOCTOR FINISHES FIDDLING.\nDOCTOR: There, that’1ll stop them trying to steal my power again. Now to take a look at the sphere.\nDOCTOR: FX. HE OPENS A ROUNDEL, PULLING OUT SOME WIRES AND GADGETRY.\nACE: What are you going to do with all that then?\nDOCTOR: Wire the sphere up to the TARDIS databanks, reprogram it to transmit human baseline DNA.\nACE: Create our very own God Seed?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Take it to Farissa and let it wreak havoc on the transformed townsfolk.\nDOCTOR: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 141\nACE: And once they’re all back to normal we go back and blow up the control unit. (MOCK INNOCENT) I can do that bit if you like? You know... if it’s helpful.\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY REMONSTRATING) Ace... If you really want to help?\nACE: (ENTHUSIASTIC) Yeah?\nDOCTOR: Check on Mel.\nACE: How? — Oh yeah, still got that stupid dinosaur.\nACE: FX. SHE PULLS OUT THE WALKIE TALKIE.\nACE: Mel?

We need to be careful. If we just walk out there...\nACE: We'll be swamped before we can do anything.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. It should be quick. But the numbers aren’t exactly on our side.\nROMERO: I don’t understand much but it sounds like you need a distraction.\nACE: You've got it. Professor, I’1ll run out of the door, and when the cooey libras start chasing me, you can come behind and start blasting them with that thing.\nDOCTOR: That’s terribly dangerous.\nACE: Yeah, well, I can hack it. Anyway, if they convert me you’1l just have to convert me back won’t you?\nDOCTOR: If it even works. The two viral infections will be fighting one another. I think a secondary infection will dominate the first, but...\nNEWMAN: You just do your thing, old man. If anyone can sort this out, it’s you.\nROMERO: (SLIGHTLY DISTANT) Be ready.\nACE: Eh? — Juan!\nACE: FX. ROMERO THROWS BACK THE BOLTS OF THE CHURCH DOOR.\nROMERO: Make sure Mel’s alright, won’t you?

Remember the control unit?\nACE: The big control unit or the small one?\nACE: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 164\nDOCTOR: The small one.\nNEWMAN: Controlling the (STRUGGLES) hollergryphic...\nACE: (INTERRUPTING) Holographic shield thingy.\nACE: FX. PLANES ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM.\nDOCTOR: That’s the one. Well, thanks to the extra boost of power from the TARDIS I was able to stretch its range a bit.\nROMERO: I have no idea what you’re talking about.\nMEL: Neither do I. But as he’s so cheerful we’re probably fine.\nDOCTOR: I popped into the TARDIS. Took an aerial image of the town and an aerial image of the caves...\nACE: And swapped them!!!\nDOCTOR: (SLIGHTLY DEFLATED) You stole my punchline.\nDOCTOR: FX. THE PLANES PASS OVER.\nNEWMAN: I still don’t altogether get it.\nACE: From the air. The bit of hill with the caves in it...\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) And the control unit.\nACE: The big one. To the bombers, it looks like the town. But the town...\nDOCTOR: Looks like nothing but hillside. Perfectly hidden.\nNEWMAN: So they’re bombing the wrong target!\nNEWMAN: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 165\nDOCTOR: Well, that rather depends on whether you wanted to destroy a lethal alien seeding unit. doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: FX.

WE CAN STILL HEAR THE DISTANT BOMBS.\nDOCTOR: Fireworks for a happy fiesta day! (BEAT) Now I really think I do deserve tapas.\nDOCTOR: FX. HE WANDERS OFF, HIS VOICE FADING.\nDOCTOR: (CONT. )\nDOCTOR: Those nice spicy potato things. And omelette. And manchego [MAN-CHAY-GO] cheese. And alioli [AL-EE-OH-LEE]. And figs.\nDOCTOR: Maybe even... oh why not... a large glass of nispero juice.\nROMERO: I’m still utterly confused.\nNEWMAN: Don’t let it worry you, let’s see if a bottle of red wine helps.\nACE: Come on Mel, let’s see if we can sneak a glass past the Doctor.\nMEL: Maybe even two.\nMEL: FX. THEY ALL START TO WALK AWAY. VOICES FADING.\nMEL: Oh, I’ve just thought... he seems worryingly cheerful.\nACE: Don’t worry. I hid his spoons in the TARDIS ages back.\nMEL: He’1l find more...\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 168\nMEL: FX. THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE FIESTA. A SLIGHT WIND.

But now you have to go — is that what you’re telling me?\nMEL: So do you.\nROMERO: The war goes on Mel, my men and I need the rest but... it was never the end.\nMEL: It could be. You could leave, you know. Come with me?\nROMERO: I can’t. You know I can’t.\nMEL: We could go anywhere. The Doctor can do that. Anywhere. Find a piece of land somewhere...\nROMERO: These are my lands, Mel. I’m fighting to protect them.\nMEL: But if it kills you?\nROMERO: Then I will die having tried.\nMEL: Is it worth that?\nROMERO: Someone who has fought monsters for so long and you have to ask? If half of what you’ve told me over the last couple of days is true, you know I have to do this.\nMEL: What I do with the Doctor is different.\nMEL: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 169\nROMERO: Only through geography. My country is oppressed. My people are dying. I can’t abandon them.\nMEL: (BEAT. FINALLY ACCEPTING) No.\nROMERO: I could ask you to stay with me...\nMEL: Oh, Juan...\nROMERO: . but I wouldn’t. This is no life. Not really. If you can choose not to live it.\nMEL: You choose it.\nROMERO: I do, in the hope that others won’t have to make such a choice. Like you. Go, travel on. Be amazing.\nMEL: I’1ll try.\nROMERO: You’1l succeed.\nFX. THEY KISS. SLOW FADE TO: #215: FIESTA OF THE DAMNED by Guy Adams (FINAL) Page 170\nFX. THEY KISS. SLOW FADE TO: FX. FOLLOWING MORNING.

(BEAT) I’m sorry for the way we treated you, my friend. It was... un-Christian...\nLUIS: Oh don’t worry about all that. (BEAT) What’s that? He’s trying to apologise, let him!

ACE AND NEWMAN ARE SAT IN THE SQUARE, LISTENING AS WE JUST DID.\nNEWMAN: Well, the townsfolk seem to be sorting themselves out. There’s been a fair bit of damage to the town what with all those...\nACE: Cooey libras.\nNEWMAN: Yes. Well their stay was brief but they weren’t the best of guests.\nNEWMAN: FX. MEL ARRIVES.\nMEL: (SLIGHTLY SUBDUED) Everyone will be fine. Pull together. It’s\nMEL: what you do in war.\nACE: (CONCERNED) You OK, Mel?\nMEL: (BEAT) Not really. But I will be. Life goes on.
