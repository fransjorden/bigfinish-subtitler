TARDIS MALFUNCTIONING AND ALARMS ONGOING.\nDOCTOR: Thank you! Nyssa, see what you can do about the hull phasing. The controls over there should do... something.\nNYSSA: Yes, Doctor. (USES CONTROLS, SOME ALARMS STOP)\nTEGAN: At last! — So we’re alright to fly without this stabiliser Solus stole from the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Not really, no.\nTEGAN: What’s that mean, ‘not really’?\nDOCTOR: That’s not important right now.\nNYSSA: The point is, without the interface stabiliser we’ll never get out of E-Space.\nDOCTOR: Which is why I’m trying to pick up the ion trail from Solus’s spaceship.\nTEGAN: But he could have gone anywhere!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 3\nNYSSA: E-Space isn’t that big. Not compared to N-Space.\nDOCTOR: We've lost a hairpin in a swimming pool, rather than an ocean.\nTURLOUGH: It’s still a very large swimming [pool.]\nRIPPLING: ALERT SOUND.\nDOCTOR: Ah-ha!\nTEGAN: Is that it? You’ve found it?\nDOCTOR: More than that, I’ve picked up the end point of the ion trail.\nTEGAN: So his spaceship’s landed?\nTURLOUGH: Or it’s exploded.\nDOCTOR: (MANIPULATING CONTROLS) Strange, there seems to be some kind of barrier between us and its location...\nNYSSA: (USING CONTROLS) Doctor, I’ve re-routed some internal systems to compensate for the loss of dimensional shell integrity.\nTEGAN: You did what with the what?\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Nyssa. We can attempt a landing, at least. Hold on, everyone...\nSTUTTERING: MATERIALISATION STARTS.\nTEGAN: ‘Attempt’?

That thing needs a complete overhaul.\nNYSSA: She’s right, Doctor. It’s too dangerous to go back inside without the stabiliser. The outer shell could become completely detached from the internal dimensions.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. and without that seal, she’s leaking energy into the vortex. We need to find that stabiliser while we’ve still enough power to leave E-Space.\nTURLOUGH: You could have picked a more hospitable place to land. Ice, more ice and oh, what’s over there? Mountains made of ice.\nTEGAN: Whatever planet we’re on, you found the North Pole. It’s freezing!\nDOCTOR: I was rather more concerned with not getting vaporised by an energy induction barrier than checking the local weather forecast. Here, Nyssa. Take this.\nHANDS: NYSSA A TRACKER, ACTIVATES SCANNING AND BEEPING.\nNYSSA: (TAKING IT) The tracker from the console.\nDOCTOR: It’s tuned to the stabiliser’s energy signature. There aren’t many things the TARDIS will recognise as its own in this universe, let alone on this planet.\nNYSSA: It’s picking something up three kilometres in... this direction.\nDOCTOR: Good. We’ll be there in no time at all.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 5\nNYSSA: The TARDIS scanner showed life-signs that way too. A settlement of some kind.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.

The beasts gathered here. But something drew them off, to the east.\nINGER: TURNS HORSE.\nINGER: There is no tracker like you in the kingdom, Jesper. (CALLING)\nINGER: Turnabout, hunters! Turn east!\nJESPER: Look east, your majesty. What do you see?\nINGER: The shadow clouds.\nJESPER: You were right. It is another day of darkness.

ICE PLAIN\nWALKING: OVER ICE. A FEW CRACKS AND FALLING FRAGMENTS.\nTURLOUGH: What are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: One thing at a time. The TARDIS isn’t far below the surface.\nTEGAN: Yeah, I can still see the lamp.\nDOCTOR: Stay away from the edge, Tegan.\nNYSSA: If there are people in that settlement, they might be willing to help haul it out.\nDOCTOR: Before we can do anything, we need that stabiliser. (DECIDES) Come on.\nTEGAN: We’re leaving the TARDIS behind?\nTURLOUGH: We don’t have much choice.\nDOCTOR: Turlough’s right. We can’t leave until I can repair her anyway. Our first priority is that missing component.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA’S TRACKER BEEPS.\nNYSSA: At least we know it’s not too far away.\nTURLOUGH: You know what else isn’t far away?\nTURLOUGH: GROWLING, OFF.\nTEGAN: They’re like wolves!\nTURLOUGH: Only twice the size.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 8\nNYSSA: They’re so white...\nDOCTOR: No wonder we didn’t see them coming.\nTURLOUGH: This is all very well, but shouldn’t we get a move on?\nTURLOUGH: QUICKENS HIS PACE.\nDOCTOR: (ABRUPTLY) Don’t run! If they’re anything like Earth wolves, they’1l sense panic and attack.\nSCANNER: BEEPS.

The pack is on the move together.\nINGER: It is unusual for so many to be out in the daytime.\nJESPER: (FROM AHEAD) Come here, my lady. Look beyond the end of the ice-mountain pass. See what has drawn their hunger?\nJESPER: INGER’S HORSE TROTS FURTHER TO JOIN JESPER.\nINGER: More strangers? Four of them. Such odd clothing.\nJESPER: Why have they come here? Do you think they know of the other?\nINGER: They are brave or foolish to taunt the snowbeasts this way. I see no weapons...\nJESPER: Then they cannot harm us.\nINGER: Nor can they protect themselves.\nINGER: SPURS HER HORSE.\nINGER: (CALLING) With me! We shall catch ourselves something extra today!\nINGER: THEY GALLOP OFF.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: SNARLING, SNAPPING SNOWBEASTS CLOSING. TARDIS CREW HURRYING\nTHROUGH: SNOW.\nTEGAN: (WALKING QUICKLY) Walking isn’t working, Doctor. They’re gaining on us!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING QUICKLY) You’re right. Maybe we should... in fact.. Run!\nDOCTOR: THEY SET OFF RUNNING. THE SNOWBEASTS GROWL AND GIVE CHASE.\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING) Where are we going?\nNYSSA: (RUNNING) There’s a fissure in the ice-wall ahead. It looks too narrow for those creatures, if we can squeeze inside...\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Good thinking, Nyssa. Come on!\nSNOWBEASTS CLOSE IN. THEN: GALLOPING HORSES EMERGE FROM PASS,\nARROWS: SHOOTING IN FROM DISTANCE.\nINGER: (RIDING, CALLING) Yah! Fire!\nDOCTOR: Everybody! Get down!\nDOCTOR: THE TARDIS CREW DROP.

You men. Finish them off. We shall not return to my mother’s castle empty-handed after all.\nHUNTERS: DISMOUNT AND KILL SNOWBEASTS UNDER FOLLOWING.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP) Thank you! Very kind of you to come to our aid. The thing is, we’re a little lost!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 11\nHORSE: TROTS UP.\nINGER: You are in Isenfel. I cannot welcome you.

Those things meant business.\nINGER: Load the carcasses onto the cart. (TURNING HORSE) Jesper, Torsten, Ivan. Over here. We shall each take a passenger.\nHORSEMEN: APPROACH.\nINGER: Jesper. You take this man.\nJESPER: Yes, my lady. (HELPING DOCTOR) Here, sir. Take my hand.\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING UP) Thank you. I’m the Doctor and-\nINGER: (INTERRUPTING) I said save your introductions. The women can ride with these two huntsmen. (TO HUNTSMEN) Help them up.\nINGER: NYSSA AND TEGAN MOUNT OTHER HORSES THROUGH:\nNYSSA: (CLIMBING UP) Thank you.\nTEGAN: (CLIMBING UP) I can manage.

TARDIS CREW PACE IN HUGE ICE HALL.\nTEGAN: Talk about a snow queen. This whole palace, it’s carved out of ice.\nNYSSA: It’s beautiful.\nTURLOUGH: I’d sooner have central heating.\nDOCTOR: While we’re waiting... Nyssa, try the tracker again. See if we’re any closer to our missing stabiliser?\nNYSSA: (SEARCHING) Oh no... I must have dropped it when we ran from those creatures!\nDOCTOR: Ah. That’s not the best news. Not to worry. I’m sure we’ll think of something...\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS IN CORRIDOR AS KARLINA AND ENTOURAGE APPROACH.\nTEGAN: Someone’s coming!\nDOCTOR: Now smile, everyone. Be polite. It’s amazing how far it can get you.\nDOCTOR: KARLINA AND INGER ENTER WITH COURTIERS.\nKARLINA: You are all welcome to Isenfel. For now.\nINGER: Mother. These strangers were in the outer wilds. Like the other. And there was more black snow.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 15\nKARLINA: Visitors have been a rarity in the past. But not of late, it seems. We welcome any enlightenment they might bring.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, your highness. Do you mean to say you’ve had other guests recently?\nKARLINA: Questions. So soon? Before we have exchanged introductions?\nDOCTOR: Of course. I’m sorry.\nTURLOUGH: Be polite you said.\nINGER: (ANNOUNCING) My mother. Queen Karlina of Isenfel.\nDOCTOR: Your majesty. I’m the Doctor. This is Tegan, Nyssa and Turlough. My friends and I are most grateful for Princess Inger’s assistance. And your kind hospitality.\nKARLINA: (WALKING AROUND THEM) Doctor? A man of learning? Such a range of aspects you have. The boy with his fiery crown. And the women, so dark. So different. You, Doctor, you are more like a man of Isenfel. Except in your unseemly haste.\nDOCTOR: I apologise again, your majesty. It’s been rather a difficult day.\nKARLINA: Do not concern yourself. We take no offence. — We will offer you accommodation. We may talk on any subject you wish at our feast tonight.\nDOCTOR: I.. look forward to it. Thank you.\nKARLINA: SWEEPS OUT\nNYSSA: (CLOSE) She seems friendly enough.\nTEGAN: (CLOSE) You call that friendly?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Compared to some of the monarchs I’ve met, she was positively chummy.\nNYSSA: Do you think she can help us?\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope so.\nINGER: (APPROACHING) This way.

Yet not one appeared throughout the whole of my father’s reign, nor the reign of his father before him.\nSKARSGARD: I know, my lady.\nKARLINA: Now it seems we are inundated. Why? Is it a sign? Is there some... change to come?\nSKARSGARD: That is why I consult my machines. They will have the answer soon. They always do.\nKARLINA: I hope they do not say we have done wrong. We try to rule a fair and equitable kingdom.\nSKARSGARD: It is no fault of yours, my lady. It is the Balancing. That is all.\nKARLINA: Yes. But sometimes...\nKARLINA: TAPPING ON ICE DOOR.\nINGER: (OUTSIDE) Mother! Are you in there?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 19\nKARLINA: (CALLING) Yes, daughter?\nDOOR: SLIDES OPEN.\nINGER: The table is not yet set, but this ‘Doctor’ is already in the great hall.

Skarsgard?\nSKARSGARD: The Balancing will reveal itself presently. I shall keep you informed, my lady.\nKARLINA: (EXITING) Very good. Accompany us to our chambers, Inger.

(CLOSE) Do not worry, I have set some aside for the children.\nJESPER: (CLOSE) Good. I will collect it later. I was there when we found the new strangers, you know.\nROMY: (PUTTING PLATES DOWN) I heard there are four of them? So many...\nJESPER: I know... We must hope the Queen makes her decision quickly.\nROMY: (TAKING HIM TO ONE SIDE, CLOSER) Jesper.

I am looking for the steward.\nJESPER: (STOPS) He’s in the kitchens. (BEAT) May I enquire...?\nSKARSGARD: You may not.\nJESPER: Of course. It is not my business. (MOVES ON)\nSKARSGARD: (CALLING AFTER) Sir Jesper.\nJESPER: (STOPPING) Yes, Lord Balancer?\nSKARSGARD: Apologies if I seem abrupt. You do know the Balancer serves only the greater good.\nJESPER: Yes, my lord.\nSKARSGARD: You met the strangers. What did you make of them?\nJESPER: Peculiar-looking. But harmless. One has the appearance of a man of Isenfel. But the others... I’ve never seen the like.\nSKARSGARD: Thank you. I can tell you that today I am occupied with many things. Census histories. Service records. I need to prepare.\nJESPER: Of course. Your work is never-ending is it not, Balancer?\nSKARSGARD: Too true, Sir Jesper. I shall not detain you. Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 23\nSKARSGARD: WALKS OFF TO KITCHEN\nJESPER: Isenfel be constant. (SOTTO, BITTER) But for some, things end all too soon. Balancer Skarsgard.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR\nTURLOUGH: WALKS ALONG CORRIDOR.\nTURLOUGH: (TO SELF) I wonder what’s for dinner... (SEES INGER) Ah.\nINGER: Sir Turlough! (APPROACHES) You have lost your handmaidens?\nTURLOUGH: My... er..? Oh, I see. They take rather a long time to get ready. You know what girls are like. (BEAT) Or maybe you don’t.\nINGER: Are they promised to you? Either of them?\nTURLOUGH: (LAUGHS) Please, no! I‘ve done nothing to deserve that.\nINGER: You are unusual, Sir Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I’ll take that as a compliment. (BEAT) I should warn you, I-.\nINGER: (INTERRUPTING) Come with me on a night—hunt. After the feast.\nTURLOUGH: Hunting... what?\nINGER: The snowbeasts of course. They like the light of the stars. That is when most are abroad.\nTURLOUGH: Ah. Tempting as it is to venture into the freezing cold, looking for monsters who want to rip me to shreds, I think I'd rather get some rest.\nINGER: You play the game, Sir Turlough. You will be persuaded. I am sure.\nSHE: WALKS OFF\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) No. I really won’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. ANOTHER PALACE CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: WALKING ALONG ICY CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: (TO SELF) Why is it they always put the bathroom miles away from anywhere [useful...?]\nTEGAN: CHILD’S CRY, VERY DISTANT — DISTORTED BY ECHOING CORRIDORS.\nTEGAN: What was that? — Hello? Hello...?\nROMY: HURRIES ALONG CORRIDOR TOWARDS TEGAN\nROMY: (APPROACHING) Are you lost, mistress?\nTEGAN: I was just on my way back from the... oh, never mind.\nROMY: Follow me back to your room, mistress. One can easily become lost in the corridors.\nROMY: LEADS TEGAN BACK\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING) Yeah, it’s like a maze down here. All these ice tunnels. You’d think it’d feel much colder.\nROMY: (WALKING) The palace is warmed by the energies of Isenfel. It is protected.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) Protected? Protected from what?\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Tegan! — There you are.\nROMY: It would be best if you both returned to your chambers. You will be summoned to banquet in the great hall shortly.\nROMY: Then you will eat. (ALL STOP OUTSIDE A CHAMBER.) Here is your room, Mistress.\nNYSSA: Thank you. (TO TEGAN) Where did you go?\nTEGAN: I thought I heard something.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 26\nNYSSA: You shouldn’t go wandering off. We’ve no idea what animals they might be keeping here.\nTEGAN: It wasn’t an animal. It sounded human.\nROMY: (COVERING) There are many strange sounds in the lower tunnels. The warming and the cooling... The movement of the air can play tricks on the ears. (BEAT) Is there anything else, my mistresses?\nTEGAN: You don’t have to keep calling us that. We’ve got names.\nROMY: (UNSURE) I’m sorry, my lady. I don’t mean to offend.\nNYSSA: That’s all right, go about your business. We shall wait to be summoned.\nROMY: Thank you, young mistress. (WALKS OFF)\nTEGAN: I can’t bear all this bowing and scraping. It just isn’t right.\nNYSSA: That’s your problem, Tegan. These people have a very clearly defined place in their world. We shouldn’t confuse them. We don’t have any idea of the rules.\nTEGAN: You think they’re happy being slaves?\nNYSSA: No. I mean we don’t know that they are slaves. And we don’t want to disturb the order of things. We just want to leave with as little fuss as possible.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. PALACE HALL [SOME TIME LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: FADE UP. MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT, ICE FLUTES, NORDIC MEDIEVAL STYLE. MUSIC ENDS. POLITE APPLAUSE.\nKARLINA: Thank you. Now. We may eat.\nDOCTOR: Your flautists are very accomplished, your highness. It’s no mean feat to play an instrument while it melts.\nKARLINA: That is the skill of all in Isenfel. To make the most of our environment while maintaining its form.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. Have your people been settled here long?\nKARLINA: Many generations. Balancer Skarsgard keeps the records. Perhaps in a few years I will be content to look over the past.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure your dotage is a long way off.\nKARLINA: You flatter me, Doctor. But not all on Isenfel are able to enjoy so long a life. (BEAT) Your wards have arrived.\nDOCTOR: My...2 Oh, yes.\nDOCTOR: TEGAN AND NYSSA APPROACH TABLE\nKARLINA: (CALLING) Join us, ladies.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Why do I feel like I’ve come to an ABBA tribute night?\nKARLINA: What does your friend say?\nDOCTOR: She was just noting how your people have a very distinct look. (TO TEGAN) Polite, remember, Tegan.\nTEGAN: I’m only saying. All the blonde hair, blue eyes.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 28\nNYSSA: Recessive traits can become common when communities are confined in one area. A small genetic pool, specially adapted to their environment.\nDOCTOR: But don’t forget, even across different humanoid species hereditary markers can vary considerably. (BEAT) And as we’re in E-Space, we11...\nKARLINA: (INTERRUPTS) Such language! Such ideas! You are scientists? All of you?\nTEGAN: Not me. I’m just a tourist.\nNYSSA: Sit down, Tegan. — Thank you, your highness.\nNYSSA: NYSSA AND TEGAN SIT. SERVANTS BRING PLATES.\nKARLINA: Please, eat. And afterwards, you will meet our Royal Balancer.\nTEGAN: Balancer?\nDOCTOR: I imagine he’s some kind of accountant. Keeper of the royal records. Holder of the purse strings. That sort of thing. Am I right, your majesty?\nKARLINA: You may call me Karlina, Doctor. You have a curious nature, I sense.\nTEGAN: Oh yes. The Doctor’s nosy all right.\nDOCTOR: Tuck in, why don’t you, Tegan?\nTEGAN: (WHISPER, TO NYSSA) Tuck in? To what? I’ve seen bigger drumsticks on a kookaburra.\nNYSSA: (CLOSE) You saw what it’s like outside. I’m surprised they can farm anything.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 29\nTEGAN: I think I’1l stick with the salad. (PICKS UP HANDFUL OF DRY REEDS) Or rather... the dried leaves?\nKARLINA: (ACROSS TABLE) The snowrushes are most nourishing. Their\nKARLINA: flavour is bitter, but there are strong energies within.\nTEGAN: (TO KARLINA) Thank you, your majesty.\nNYSSA: (TO KARLINA) It all looks very... appetising, your highness.\nNYSSA: LOADS SOME FOOD ON HER PLATE.\nTEGAN: (TO NYSSA) At least Turlough seems to be enjoying himself over\nTEGAN: on the huntsmen’s table. With his new girlfriend...\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. PALACE HALL, INGER’S TABLE (CONTINUOUS)\nFEASTING: B/G. INGER POURS A GOBLET.\nINGER: More mead, Sir Turlough? My mother keeps a fine cellar.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you. Tell me more about this... hunt of yours?\nINGER: We venture out, under cover of the Isenfel night. The snowbeasts prowl in greater number once darkness falls.\nTURLOUGH: Snowbeasts... Those wolf-things. Is the hunting just for sport, or do you...\nINGER: (INTERRUPTING) We hunt the beasts. And so we kill them. What would be the point of it otherwise? They must be culled.\nTURLOUGH: (EATING) I see. And what do you do with them afterwards?\nINGER: We wear their skins. Burn their fat in candles. (BEAT) You are\nINGER: eating the flesh of one of them now.\nTURLOUGH: (SPITTING OUT FOOD) What? I thought it was chicken!\nINGER: What is... chicken?\nTURLOUGH: Never mind. I’ve suddenly lost my appetite.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. PALACE HALL (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR WHO: PLATES AND FOOD BEING PASSED. HUBBUB OF COURTIERS AT TABLE.\nDOCTOR: Thank you again, Karlina. I hope we shan’t impose on you for too long.\nKARLINA: Stay as long as you wish, Doctor. Your company is most illuminating. We have little ‘science’ here.\nDOCTOR: It’s not the be-all and end-all. I’m sure, given time, your people’s skills will develop.\nKARLINA: We have had much time already. But the mysteries of our world are still largely unknown.\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s no rush. You’ve music, culture, craftsmanship. Above all, you too seem to have a healthy sense of curiosity. It’s a very good start.\nKARLINA: Nothing will change here. Not for a long while.\nDOCTOR: What makes you say that? (BEAT) Your daughter mentioned a stranger when we arrived. You said Isenfel does not have many visitors?\nKARLINA: It is a very rare occurrence.\nDOCTOR: But there was one recently? Before us?\nKARLINA: A vessel appeared. A thing from the stars.\nDOCTOR: Yes. We noticed some debris on the ice.\nKARLINA: We saw its falling lights, several nights ago.\nDOCTOR: And that’s how this stranger arrived?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 32\nKARLINA: A man was found in the wreckage. You must understand. We meet very few travellers from... outside. A handful over several generations. But now... you are so many.\nDOCTOR: This man’s name, was it ‘Solus’?\nKARLINA: Yes. I believe it was. Balancer Skarsgard was the one who tended him.\nDOCTOR: He was unwell?\nKARLINA: Alas, he was terribly injured when his carriage crashed into the ice.\nDOCTOR: He was badly injured before the crash — er, quite possibly. Tell me, is this Solus still here? Somewhere in the palace?\nKARLINA: Unfortunately, his wounds meant he could not survive.\nDOCTOR: I see. (BEAT) Was he carrying anything? A glowing red crystal, perhaps?\nKARLINA: You would have to ask the Balancer these questions. (STANDING) Our musicians are ready once again. (CALLING) Please. Play for our guests.\nKARLINA: CLAPS. MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT BEGINS AGAIN.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR, OUTSIDE HALL\nDOCTOR WHO: FEASTING AND MUSIC IN HALL, OFF.

Lord Balancer, sir!\nROMY: (WHISPER) Jesper! No!\nJESPER: (CATCHING UP, PLEADING) Please, sir. I have only just heard! Madam Romy is my wife. I would go in her stead.\nSKARSGARD: You know the rules, Jesper. This is her turn. We do not question the Balancing.\nJESPER: Please.\nSKARSGARD: Your mother and father did the same. As did Romy’s. As did their parents before them. It cannot be changed. Not for anyone.\nJESPER: I am sorry. Lord Balancer. It does not seem fair.\nSKARSGARD: There is no fair, or unfair. Only perpetual balance. Isenfel constant. (BEAT, FIRMER) Isenfel be constant.\nJESPER: (MUTTERED) Isenfel be constant.\nSKARSGARD: (TO SERVANTS) You four, your Queen awaits.

My mother is making arrangements for you to stay. — Ah, here they come now.\nSKARSGARD: LEADS SERVANTS INTO HALL.\nTURLOUGH: Who are those people?\nINGER: Servants. This will not take much time. We can be on our way\nINGER: soon.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT.

Now, excuse me while I perform my official duties.\nSERVANTS: ASSEMBLE BEFORE THE QUEEN’S TABLE. HALL FALLS QUIET.\nSKARSGARD: Here, my lady. We have four guests in Isenfel. So I bring four servants.\nNYSSA: We’ve no need of servants, your majesty.\nSKARSGARD: They are not for your use, young mistress. (CALLING) Behold, the Gauge of Equilibrium. (HOLDS UP BALANCING ROD)\nSKARSGARD: GEIGER-COUNTER-LIKE RATTLING FROM THE ROD\nPEOPLE: (MURMUR, LIKE A PRAYER RESPONSE) The Gauge of Equilibrium.\nKARLINA: (STANDING) It is the time of the Balancing. Equilibrium must be maintained.\nPEOPLE: (MURMUR) Equilibrium.\nTEGAN: Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure. (TO KARLINA) Queen Karlina-\nKARLINA: (CUTTING HIM OFF) Silence, please. (TO ALL) These strangers are pleasing to us. We would have them remain in our company. And so the price must be paid. Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR: (TO TEGAN AND NYSSA) Four of them, four of us. Oh no.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 36\nNYSSA: What is it?\nTEGAN: Yeah, what’s the problem?\nDOCTOR: Four of them, four of us. Don’t you see?!\nPEOPLE: (MUTTERED AROUND ROOM, UNDER PREVIOUS) Isenfel be constant.\nKARLINA: On your knees. Romy. Helgar. Petra. Lars. You have served us well. We thank you.\nSERVANTS: KNEEL.\nSKARSGARD: Ready weapons!\nGUARDS: DRAW SWORDS.\nTEGAN: What are they doing? Doctor, what’s going on?\nKARLINA: Fare thee well in the next life, good citizens of Isenfel. You die in the knowledge that you preserve the balance of our kingdom.\nDOCTOR: (LEAPING UP) Your majesty, no! Please, not on our account!\nKARLINA: Skarsgard. Execute them.\nKARLINA: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 37"

You die in the knowledge that you preserve the balance of our kingdom.\nDOCTOR: (LEAPING UP) Your majesty, no! Please, not on our account!\nKARLINA: Skarsgard. Execute them.\nCONTINUES INTO: SCENE 21: INT. PALACE HALL (CONTINUOUS)\nDOCTOR: LEAPS TABLE AND RUNS FORWARD. SWORDSMEN HESITATE.\nDOCTOR: Please! Whatever your traditions dictate, I can’t allow this to happen!\nKARLINA: You stand in the way of our swordsmen? This is most unusual.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING) Doctor! What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Stay there, Turlough. I’m sure this can all be sorted out amicably.\nKARLINA: (APPROACHING) Your confusion is understandable. You do not know our tradition.\nTEGAN: It’s tradition to slaughter the waiting staff when you invite someone over to dinner?\nTEGAN: CLICKING FROM SKARSGARD’S GAUGE.\nSKARSGARD: The Balancing... The Balancing is disturbed...\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: Believe me, if there’s some kind of population control in operation, we are more than happy to leave just as soon as we can.\nSKARSGARD: (READING GAUGE) This is not right...\nKARLINA: You do not wish to enjoy our hospitality? But we hope to learn so much from you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Then the first lesson is to stop these needless killings. Going ahead with this barbaric ‘tradition’ doesn’t encourage me to teach you anything.\nSKARSGARD: My lady! The gauge. It is changing.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) Let me take a look at that.\nSKARSGARD: (SNATCHING GAUGE AWAY) No. It is forbidden. Only the Balancer may hold it.\nDOCTOR: All right. So what is your ‘Gauge of Equilibrium’ telling you?\nSKARSGARD: The energies... they are shifting.\nDOCTOR: If you want my help, I suggest you enlighten me a little further.\nKARLINA: Not here. We should not disturb the court any more than it is already.\nKARLINA: CLAPS.\nKARLINA: (CALLING) The feast is over. It seems Isenfel is undecided as to how to account for our guests. For a little while at least. All of you. Return to your dwellings.\nPEOPLE: (START TO MOVE OFF, CONFUSED MUTTERINGS EG:) The feast is over?/ Isenfel undecided?/ What’s all this about?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 39\nKARLINA: (CALLING) We thank our servants for their loyalty. Isenfel be constant.\nPEOPLE: (MUTTERED RESPONSES AS THEY LEAVE) Isenfel be constant.\nNYSSA: (CLOSE) Doctor, what’s happening here?\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Whatever it is, it’s clearly ingrained. I suggest we tread carefully and do as they say. For now.\nTEGAN: (CLOSE) Those servants were all so calm about it, happy to be led like lambs to the slaughter. How can any queen justify treating her people like that?\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) I don’t know. But I’m going to find out.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: EXT. TUNDRA\nDOCTOR WHO: JESPER AND ROMY WALKING OVER ICE TOWARDS VILLAGE\nJESPER: Are you all right? Romy? You have not spoken since we left the hall.\nROMY: I was ready, Jesper. I was ready for death. But all I could think of was them. The poor little mites. We no longer have Marta to help us. If anything happened to you, they’1l have no- one.\nJESPER: You are right. I have spoken with Caspar and Ella. I think they will join with us. Assist us.\nROMY: Maybe these strangers will change things.\nJESPER: The other one didn’t. We cannot rely on outsiders. We need to do this ourselves.\nJESPER: COMMOTION OF VILLAGERS MOVING CARTS, ANIMALS, OFF. THEY STOP. STATIC-LIKE WHITE NOISE OF BLACK SNOW, DISTANT.\nVILLAGERS: (CALLING) Get clear! Move away.\nROMY: There’s a commotion in the village.\nJESPER: The black snow falls so close.\nROMY: The Balancer should have taken me. I should have let it happen. Now we are paying the price.\nGOATS: BLEATING. OLD MAN TRYING TO HERD THEM\nJESPER: No. The black snow comes most nights now. It will require more than a few of Gerhard’s goats to pay for those strangers’ lives.\nROMY: It should have been me. Only a human life can balance a human life.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 41\nJESPER: We’re supposed to be equal. But the privileged are protected. You know that. And you know why the black snow is really coming. We both do, Romy.\nROMY: We must do something...\nJESPER: (CALLING) Gerhard! Get away! Leave them! (TO ROMY) The old fool. He should let the animals go.\nROMY: I know I shouldn’t feel relieved. I shouldn’t fear the Balancing. But I do.\nJESPER: I know, woman. So do I. So do others. Now get yourself home. Stew some tea. I’11 stop our neighbour getting himself killed. (CALLING) Gerhard!\nJESPER: RUNS TO HELP.\nROMY: (TO SELF) No. I don’t want to die. I’m not ready. Not yet.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23: INT. PALACE CHAMBER\nICE: DOOR SLIDES CLOSED. TEGAN AND NYSSA WALK INSIDE.\nTEGAN: I knew there was something fishy going on. What kind of society treats its servants like that?\nNYSSA: Those people were so calm. They didn’t question it.\nTEGAN: You still think they should know their place?\nNYSSA: I admit. It’s shocking to us. But it seems to be embedded. Everyone accepts this is the way things are.\nTEGAN: That Balancer bloke. The Doctor thought he was like.. an accountant. But even the taxman doesn’t want you beheaded.\nNYSSA: At least the Queen was willing to talk to the Doctor. Maybe there’s something he can do.\nTEGAN: There should be something we can do too.\nSLIDES: OPEN ICE DOOR.\nTEGAN: Our escorts have disappeared. At least we’re not prisoners. —\nFOLLOW: THEM INTO CORRIDOR.\nNYSSA: The Doctor told us to stay in our rooms.\nTEGAN: What if they’re keeping people prisoner? What if there’s a whole jail full of willing human sacrifices? — Look, we’ve got to do something!\nNYSSA: We can’t go trampling over their traditions. You’ve seen what happens. These people are used to killing.\nTEGAN: SLIDES ICE DOOR SHUT.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 43\nTEGAN: All right. We’1ll trample... carefully. Come on. I heard something down this way before...\nTEGAN: THEY WALK DOWN CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: EXT. OUTSIDE PALACE STABLES\nHORSES: BEING LED OUT. INGER TACKING UP 2 x HORSES THROUGH:\nTURLOUGH: You want me to what?!\nDOCTOR: Humour her. She’s obviously taken a liking to you.\nINGER: (CALLING) Hurry, Sir Turlough. You promised me. The sooner we leave, the sooner your Doctor friend can attend my mother.\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Thank you, your highness. I shan’t keep your riding companion a moment.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, this Princess is clearly psychotic.\nDOCTOR: At the moment the royal family of Isenfel is still inclined to be friendly towards us. There’s no reason to lose that advantage.\nTURLOUGH: But those creatures are out there-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) The Princess and her Huntsmen are used to dealing with them. By the time you all get back, I’m sure I’1l have everything sorted out and we’1ll be ready for the off.\nTURLOUGH: Despite the TARDIS being under several metres of ice?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t forgotten. In fact, I suspect it’s the TARDIS that’s given us this opportunity.\nTURLOUGH: What? How?\nDOCTOR: (MUSING) But when her self-diagnostics kick in, I’m not sure we'll have very much longer...\nTURLOUGH: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR: I suspect it’s all a question of energy conservation.\nINGER: LEADS HORSE OVER\nINGER: Here. Sir Turlough. Your steed.\nDOCTOR: Up you get, Turlough. It’s like riding a bike. Only with legs.\nTURLOUGH: I never ride bikes. If I fall off and break my neck, I blame you. (EFFORTS AS MOUNTS HORSE)\nDOCTOR: (IGNORING HIM) That’s the spirit.\nDOCTOR: SLAPS HORSE’S FLANK. IT CANTERS OFF.\nINGER: (ON HORSE) So eager, Sir Turlough. Wait for me! (CLICKS TONGUE;\nJINGLES: TACK; HORSE CANTERS OFF)\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Now.. How to change a society’s entire belief system overnight? (ENTERING CASTLE) Why can’t I ever just go horse- riding...?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: INT. BALANCING CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: CLICKING, WHIRRING BALANCING CHAMBER B/G. DOOR SLIDES OPEN.\nSKARSGARD: Enter, my lady, please.\nKARLINA: We are curious, Balancer. Our kingdom makes an exception for this Doctor and his friends.\nSKARSGARD: I have never seen such a thing before.\nKARLINA: What do your signs and numbers say? What does the Gauge of Equilibrium tell you?\nKARLINA: CLICKING OF GAUGE. TINKLING EFFECT CONTINUING THROUGH AS\nHOLOGRAPHIC: READOUTS ARE ACTIVATED.\nSKARSGARD: ‘Recalibration’.. this word is new to me.\nKARLINA: I have summoned this Doctor to the Balancing Chamber. Maybe he can aid our understanding.\nSKARSGARD: You invite a stranger here? How can one not of Isenfel come to understand Isenfel?\nKARLINA: Perhaps the picture is seen clearer from without, not within.\nSKARSGARD: My lady-\nKARLINA: My guardsmen will escort him once Inger has taken the boy on her hunt. He will be here soon.\nSKARSGARD: I see you will not be turned from this course. You were always headstrong. Even as a girl.\nKARLINA: I used to come and watch these lights and symbols dance across the ice back then.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 47\nSKARSGARD: I should guard the secrets of the Balancing more carefully. (SHUTS OFF TINKLING HOLOGRAPHS) You should not have been in here unsupervised.\nKARLINA: My father knew I came.\nSKARSGARD: He was a good man. He knew his duty. I know the villagers suspect the rules do not apply to the high-born. But the Balancing is clear. Each family must make way for every new addition.\nKARLINA: After Inger was born, Gustav and I would come here too. Just to get away from everyone.\nSKARSGARD: I was aware of this transgression, at least, my lady. I thought you both deserved some private time. Prince Gustav was also a good man.\nSKARSGARD: BEAT OF SILENCE.\nKARLINA: I have been thinking long on my husband’s death. And the more I think... the more it appears to be without meaning. Our child did not survive six winters.\nSKARSGARD: There is no knowing the ways of the Balancing.\nKARLINA: Then perhaps it is time we learned.\nSKARSGARD: That is why you hold this stranger to your bosom? It does not sit well with me.\nKARLINA: Be careful, Skarsgard. Do not speak out of turn.\nSKARSGARD: Only, I have observed... When you talk to him, there is a light in your eyes I have not seen for a long time. It is you who should take care, majesty.\nKARLINA: This is an opportunity, Skarsgard. Something my father never had. A chance to gain greater knowledge.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 48\nSKARSGARD: You assume that greater knowledge is for the best. Where Isenfel is concerned, that may not be true.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: 6 x HORSES GALLOP ALONG.\nINGER: (CALLING) The ride is thrilling, is it not, Sir Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING) That’s one word for it.\nINGER: Halt. Here. (ALL PULL UP THEIR HORSES THROUGH:) There is a nest beyond that ridge. I spied a giant beast these last few nights.\nTURLOUGH: Then maybe we shouldn’t get too close.\nINGER: Torsten. Go ahead and find the trail.\nHUNSTMAN: (CALLING) At your command, Princess. Yah! (SPURS HORSE AND\nRIDES: ON)\nINGER: We seek the pack leader, no less. Its head would be quite a prize to set above my mother’s hearth.\nTURLOUGH: While you stew the rest of it up for dinner. Yes, I can quite believe- (BREAKS OFF)\nSTATIC: CRACKLING OF BLACK SNOW IN DISTANCE.\nTURLOUGH: What’s that? Back there, falling from the sky?\nINGER: The black snow?\nTURLOUGH: Yes, we saw it when we arrived. Is it some kind of weather phenomenon?\nINGER: It is something we should stay away from. The black snow dissolves matter.\nTURLOUGH: It does what?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 50\nINGER: It is Isenfel’s way of restoring the balance. If we do not do it ourselves, the black snow will come and do it for us. Isenfel be constant.\nTURLOUGH: It’s moving over towards the village. It’s getting quite close to the houses.\nINGER: It is the peasants’ own fault if they do not balance their affairs.\nINGER: HUNSTMAN’S HORSE APPROACHES.\nTURLOUGH: No-one’s very big on empathy here, are they?\nHUNSTMAN: (CALLING, OFF) Majesty. We have the tracks!\nINGER: Come on. Follow me, Sir Turlough. We shall find this beast! Yah!\nINGER: THEY RIDE ON.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA AND TEGAN WALKING ON ICE-FLOOR THROUGH:\nTEGAN: It was along here. Listen. Can you hear anything?\nNYSSA: It feels like we’re going downhill. Perhaps we should just go back?\nTEGAN: The cellars. Just the place you’d put a dungeon.\nNYSSA: That noise could have been anything. An underground stream, the ice structures shifting. All these corridors... there’ll be echoes. Romy said this place could do strange things to sound.\nTEGAN: Yeah. And don’t you think she looked more scared talking to us than when the queen was [about to-]\nNYSSA: (CUTS HER OFF) Shh!\nNYSSA: A CHILD'S CRY OFF, DISTANT.\nTEGAN: There. That was definitely something.\nNYSSA: (SETTING OFF) It came from this way. You were right, Tegan.\nTEGAN: No. You were right. We should go back and tell the Doctor.\nNYSSA: We’ve come this far.. We should check first. So we’ve got something to tell him.\nTEGAN: Why are you so keen all of a sudden?\nNYSSA: I can’t be absolutely certain... But that sounded like a child.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. PALACE CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: CLICKING, WHIRRING CLOCKWORK BALANCING CHAMBER B/G. KNOCK ON ICE DOOR. IT SLIDES OPEN.\nDOCTOR: (AT DOORWAY) Your majesty.\nKARLINA: Welcome, Doctor. This is our Balancing Chamber.\nSKARSGARD: Consider very carefully, my lady. Should we really allow a stranger to know our secrets?\nDOCTOR: Will you accept my help, Karlina?\nSKARSGARD: I warn you that no good can- [come]\nKARLINA: (INTERRUPTING) Balancer Skarsgard. I am ruler here. And I say we at least speak with the Doctor. What harm can it do?\nSKARSGARD: But my lady-\nKARLINA: Answer his questions. That is all I wish for now.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Thank you, Karlina. (LOOKING AROUND) So tell me, what exactly are you balancing here?\nSKARSGARD: Everything. All energies must be kept in harmony.\nDOCTOR: Including the people?\nKARLINA: All arrivals require departures. Every birth must be balanced by death.\nDOCTOR: So when the royal family bears another heir, the commoners have to pay with their lives?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 53\nKARLINA: No! Every family takes responsibility for its own. Mine certainly has.\nDOCTOR: I see. So when you said not many reach old age in Isenfel, that’s why. They’re forced to make way for the next generation.\nSKARSGARD: Not just people. Animals too. Our livestock must be carefully accounted for. The crops, such as they are. All energies that are harnessed and consumed. No excess is permitted.\nDOCTOR: It’s impossible to keep account of everything. What about the wildlife we encountered, for a start?\nSKARSGARD: Princess Inger has charge of the culls. She has a quota.\nKARLINA: If we do not do this, then Isenfel settles its own account.\nDOCTOR: How? (BEAT) Please. A little enlightenment won’t go amiss. Not if it saves lives.\nKARLINA: That is the problem. We cannot afford to save every life.\nDOCTOR: People can’t be regulated like water from a tap.\nSKARSGARD: That is exactly what must happen.\nKARLINA: (DECIDING) Show him, Skarsgard. I command it.\nSKARSGARD: I can only obey. — Here, Doctor. This is the Balancing.\nSKARSGARD: ACTIVATES EQUILIBRIUM GAUGE. TINKLING HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I wanted to ask you about this machinery of yours. Cogs and clockwork, interesting. What’s it all for?\nSKARSGARD: Regard the display, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: Numbers on a holographic readout. What’re they telling you, Skarsgard?\nSKARSGARD: There should be nine thousand five hundred and eighty-two souls in Isenfel.\nKARLINA: There always have been. And there always will be.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: EXT. ICE RIDGE\nDOCTOR WHO: 6 x HORSES GALLOPING ALONG.\nINGER: (CALLING) Halt here.\nHUNSTMAN: (CALLING) Hold, men!\nHORSES: STOP.\nINGER: Dismount, Sir Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: It’d be a pleasure.\nTURLOUGH: INGER AND TURLOUGH DISMOUNT.\nINGER: Torsten. Stay with the steeds. I will take our visitor closer to the lair.\nHUNSTMAN: Yes, majesty.\nTURLOUGH: Is that wise? I’d be quite happy to see the wildlife from a distance.\nCRUNCHING: OVER ICE. INGER CROUCHES BY RIDGE AND LOOKS OVER.\nSNORING: SNOWBEAST FAINT BELOW.\nINGER: (HUSHED) Here, Sir Turlough. — You see the cleft in the ice? That is where it makes its den.\nCROUCHING: BESIDE HER.\nTURLOUGH: Not the most comfortable of beds.\nINGER: We are close now. I can smell the beast.\nTURLOUGH: (SHIFTS CLOSER) And I can see it. Sleeping. It’s huge...\nINGER: Let me string an arrow...\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 56\nSTRINGING: ARROW INTO BOW.\nTURLOUGH: You can’t expect to kill a beast that size with a single arrow!\nINGER: I do not mean to kill the beast yet, Sir Turlough. Only to wake it. I want to hunt.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nINGER: When I loose this shaft, run for your steed. The beast will be quick. So we must be quicker.\nTURLOUGH: (EDGING BACK) You really are utterly mad. Well, if you’re not going to let sleeping dogs lie, I’m getting a head start.\nSETS: OFF BACK TO HORSE.\nINGER: You want to race, Sir Turlough? That suits me well.\nFIRES: ARROW. SNOWBEAST ROARS IN ANGER. INGER RUNS FOR HER HORSE.\nINGER: Now the chase is on!\nSNOWBEAST: SCRAMBLES SNARLING OUT OF ICE AND ONTO PLAIN, GIVES A\nHUGE: ROAR.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. BALANCING CHAMBER\nCLICKING: BALANCING CHAMBER, WITH TINKLING HOLOGRAMS ACTIVATED.\nDOCTOR: Can’t you see how monstrous this is? How long have you been dishing out death sentences on the whim of these... fairy lights?\nSKARSGARD: It has ever been so. And it shall ever be so. Isenfel be constant!\nKARLINA: Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR: Isenfel be blowed! I refuse to believe any society can be this blinkered, this stifled, all of its own accord. E-Space or not, this isn’t how life works.\nSKARSGARD: This is our way of life. It is no mere belief.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s not. Despite the clockwork dressing, the technology behind that display is far beyond the capabilities of a society like yours. (BEAT) Still, now we know what happened to Solus, I suppose.\nKARLINA: I told you. Your fellow stranger’s injuries meant that he could not survive.\nDOCTOR: But he didn’t die from those injuries, did he?\nSKARSGARD: His presence could not be sustained.\nKARLINA: It made no sense to sacrifice one of my healthy subjects for this man.\nDOCTOR: So you put him to death.\nKARLINA: Yes. (BEAT) Was that wrong?\nDOCTOR: And there we have the nub of the problem.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: STARTS PULLING COMPONENTS FROM WALLS. COGS AND WHEELS CLATTER.\nSKARSGARD: Do not touch the sacred machines of the Balancing!\nDOCTOR: (PULLING THINGS FROM WALL) Sacred machines, Skarsgard? That doesn’t ring true I’m afraid.\nMORE: COGS AND WHEELS CLATTER.\nKARLINA: Doctor! We did not ask for this!\nSKARSGARD: (DISTRAUGHT) See, my lady. It was folly to show him! This Doctor would destroy everything!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nHORSES: GALLOP IN PURSUIT OF SNARLING, SNAPPING SNOWBEAST\nINGER: (RIDING) There it goes! Keep hard on its trail.\nTURLOUGH: (RIDING) It can’t run forever, can it?\nINGER: (RIDING) You do well to keep up with my riders, Sir Turlough. You enjoy yourself after all!\nTURLOUGH: (RIDING) I just don’t want to get left behind out here with more of those things!\nINGER: (CALLING) There. It heads between the ice-dunes. Take care now. We are nearing the Edge.\nALL: RIDERS SLOW.\nTURLOUGH: The Edge? Of what?\nSNARLING: RUNNING BEAST SUDDENLY YELPS, OFF.\nINGER: It is injured! Chase it down!\nSNOWBEAST: HOWLS WITH PAIN, OFF. CRACKLING DISTORTED ROARS DROWN IT OUT.\nTURLOUGH: What was that?\nINGER: I do not know. (CALLING) Advance with care...\nSEVERAL: CREATURES GROWL AND SNARL, SIMILAR TO SNOWBEAST BUT WITH ENHANCED FX MAKING THE NOISES DISTORTED AND CRACKLE. THEY APPROACH FROM AROUND THE DUNE.\nTURLOUGH: I think we know what finished it off...\nINGER: What are these creatures?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 60\nTURLOUGH: Black snowbeasts. You don’t think...\nINGER: What?\nTURLOUGH: That they might perhaps serve the same function as the black snow?\nINGER: I have never seen these monsters before. (STRINGING BOW) But I shall have a new hide to wear... Fire!\nINGER: INGER AND HUNTERS FIRE ARROW AT THEM. BLACK SNOWBEASTS ROAR AND\nARROWS: SHIMMER AND DISSOLVE.\nTURLOUGH: They just dissolved your arrows. And they haven’t stopped.\nHUNTSMAN: I shall put them to the sword, Princess!\nTURLOUGH: No, wait! — Don’t you see? You can’t kill them, you [idiot!]\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS ATTACK. HUNTSMAN SCREAMS AND DISSOLVES FIZZING.\nTURLOUGH: Told you.\nINGER: Back! Come, Sir Turlough. Away from the pack!\nTURLOUGH: Too late! They’re coming!\nBLACK: BEASTS SNARL AND HOWL AND ATTACK THE HUNTSMEN.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. BALANCING CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: FINISHES PULLING FINAL COGS AND WHEELS FROM WALL —\nWHIRRING: B/G HAS STOPPED. TINKLING HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY\nCONTINUES: B/G\nSKARSGARD: You have desecrated the Balancing Chamber. You have destroyed my machines.\nDOCTOR: I’ve done nothing of the sort. Look. Your holographic interface is functioning perfectly.\nKARLINA: It is true, Skarsgard. The lights still dance. The Balancing continues.\nDOCTOR: (TAPPING ICE, FEELING ALONG WALL) The readouts are being projected into the ice. They’re generated from something behind these walls.\nKARLINA: We are beneath the centre of our palace. There are no other chambers to find.\nDOCTOR: All those cogs and wheels were decorations, built up over years. Trinkets, like the Balancer’s accoutrements of office.\nSKARSGARD: The symbols of my power!\nDOCTOR: We know about your Gauge of Equilibrium, of course — but what’s that thing hanging from your belt? (BEAT) It looks very much like a light -key.\nSKARSGARD: The Lens of Harmony? It is not a key to anything.\nDOCTOR: Of course, you’ve no reason to think it’s a key, if you don’t even know there’s a door.\nKARLINA: There is only one door into this room. Doctor, you were supposed to provide understanding but you bring only confusion!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR: All right. Answer me one more question and then I’1l stop. How many Balancers have there been?\nKARLINA: I do not understand. There has always been a Balancer.\nSKARSGARD: And I am fortunate enough to hold that position.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought it was an office, a title. But no, it’s only ever been you, hasn’t it?\nSKARSGARD: I... am.. the Balancer. It is the way it has always been.\nKARLINA: Skarsgard served my father and his father before him.\nDOCTOR: Really? Is that really true? And you don’t think there’s anything unusual about that?\nKARLINA: It’s the way-\nDOCTOR: -it has always been. Yes. So tell, me Karlina. What kind of man lives hundreds, maybe thousands of years while all around him grow old and die? Hm?\nKARLINA: (CONFUSED) It is... Skarsgard.. He is the Balancer.\nDOCTOR: Possibly no kind of man at all.\nSKARSGARD: Do not insult me. I am loyal. I am true. I serve Isenfel.\nDOCTOR: That’s as maybe. But let’s see what happens when we go through the looking glass.\nDOCTOR: SNATCHES KEY FROM SKARSGARD’S BELT.\nSKARSGARD: What? — No! Give me back the Lens of Harmony!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: If this is a key — this slot must be the lock, I think. (HE\nCLICKS: KEY INTO PLACE IN ICE WALL)\nICE: STARTS SLIDING, WALLS MOVING, SMOOTH ELECTRONIC HUM BEHIND.\nDOCTOR: There, what did I tell you?\nKARLINA: Skarsgard, what is happening?\nSKARSGARD: (ELECTRONIC DISTORT, ROBOTIC) Maintenance access granted. Maintenance access granted.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. LOWER ROOM\nSEVERAL: CHILDREN OF TODDLER AGE AND BELOW QUIETLY PLAYING THROUGH.\nROMY: That’s it, my loves. You stay quiet. Uncle Jesper will be along soon with milk and biscuits.\nROMY: TAPPING ON ICE DOOR.\nROMY: That’1l be him now.\nDOOR: SLIDES OPEN.\nNYSSA: Romy !\nROMY: Oh no... You!\nROMY: TEGAN AND NYSSA ENTER.\nTEGAN: So this is what you were hiding!\nNYSSA: Don’t be alarmed, Romy. We only want to help you.\nTEGAN: Nyssa... You were right. Little kids! It’s like a créche.\nDOOR: CLOSES BEHIND THEM.\nROMY: Oh my mistresses. Please... You should not have come!\nNYSSA: I’m guessing the queen knows nothing of this?\nROMY: Do not betray us.. I beg you.\nTEGAN: Why are you holding all these children prisoner?\nROMY: No! We are protecting them. Here is the safest place in the kingdom for them.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 65\nTEGAN: Right underneath the queen and her guards?\nROMY: We have always believed the palace shields the royals from the gaze of the Balancing.\nTEGAN: What do you mean? Shields them?\nNYSSA: I think I understand... You think keeping them here means their families outside don’t have to.. pay.\nDOOR: OPENS. JESPER ENTERS.\nROMY: We are saving the lives of their kin.\nTEGAN: By keeping these kids locked up?\nJESPER: My wife is right. We are saving everybody’s lives.\nDOOR: CLOSES\nNYSSA: Jesper. We need to find our friend. The Doctor will know what\nNYSSA: to do.\nJESPER: No. (DRAWS SWORD) You both stay where you are.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. INNER BALANCING CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: HUM OF HOLOGRAPHIC CONTROL SYSTEMS. OCCASIONAL CHATTER OF CALCULATION.\nDOCTOR: So this is the secret inside your palace.\nSKARSGARD: (ROBOTIC FX) Isenfel be constant... Isenfel be constant.\nKARLINA: What has happened to Skarsgard? He is bewitched?\nDOCTOR: He’s a part of the system.\nKARLINA: These machines... I have never seen the like...\nDOCTOR: You say Isenfel has no science, Karlina? I think you’ve rather more of it than you realise...\nKARLINA: What is Skarsgard?\nDOCTOR: Good question. I think he’s been left to watch over things. A kind of.. monitor. (TO SELF) How long has this been running?\nDOCTOR: TRIES SOME CONTROLS, TINKLY ACTIVATION SOUNDS.\nKARLINA: Should you be touching those devices?\nDOCTOR: How else can I find out what’s going on?\nKARLINA: You understand them?\nDOCTOR: (USING CONTROLS) I’m a quick learner. Borusa always said my understanding of logical systems far surpassed my ability to explain them. (USING CONTROLS) Ah, as I thought.\nKARLINA: The Balancing... It is controlled by these screens and lights?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: Skarsgard here’s been taking his duties rather too literally. The system is set to maintain constant energy levels, but it allows for the ebb and flow of life. There are stress factors built into the parameters, see?\nKARLINA: Your words... wash over me...\nDOCTOR: Look, Karlina. You recognise this? (ACTIVATES MAP)\nDOCTOR: HUM OF MAP DISPLAY.\nKARLINA: It is a map.. of my kingdom.\nDOCTOR: Sealed inside an energy dome. The transduction barrier the\nTARDIS: crossed... (TO KARLINA) And what do you think these pulses represent?\nBEEPING: PULSES.\nKARLINA: Lives. Individuals. My people.\nDOCTOR: The system’s at its limit. There’s an energy threshold it’s meant to maintain. It’s adapted. In fact... it’s taken it upon itself to create its own means of matter dispersal.\nKARLINA: The black snow?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. And maybe something more.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: EXT. EDGE OF ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: INGER AND TURLOUGH’S HORSES RACING TOWARDS THE EDGE - AN ENERGY WATERFALL AT THE END OF THE WORLD.\nINGER: Pull up, Sir Turlough!\nINGER: THEY STOP. INGER DISMOUNTS.\nINGER: We continue on foot. The horses can carry us no more.\nTURLOUGH: (DISMOUNTING) What about your Huntsmen? Are they...?\nINGER: They gave their lives so we could escape the black beasts... But I fear there is no escape. See where they have driven us.\nINGER: THEY WALK CLOSER TO THE ENERGY WATERFALL.\nTURLOUGH: What is that?\nINGER: It is the edge of our world!\nTURLOUGH: The edge..? You mean the planet just ends right there?\nINGER: Your world does not?\nTURLOUGH: No. Nor does any other I’ve been to. What’s over the edge?\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS DISTORTED SNARLING IN DISTANCE APPROACHING.\nINGER: No-one knows. But I fear we may be the first to find out...\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. LOWER ROOM\nJESPER: (ADVANCES WITH SWORD) You shouldn’t have come here, young mistresses.\nTEGAN: Now hold on a minute. Put the sword away!\nNYSSA: Please, we didn’t mean any harm!\nJESPER: When I balance your lives against that of my wife, against the lives of these children... I know which way the scales fall.\nROMY: Jesper, no!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nHORSES: WHINNY. DISTORTED SNARLING AS BLACK SNOWBEASTS APPROACH.\nTURLOUGH: What now, Inger? There’s nowhere left to run.\nINGER: The steeds are exhausted. Death will be a release for them.\nTURLOUGH: I was thinking more about us.\nINGER: I am glad to have met you. You have been most diverting company, Sir Turlough.\nHORSE: WHINNYING, DEVOURED BY BLACK SNOWBEAST DISTORTION.\nINGER: (CALLING) Come, creatures of darkness! I am a royal daughter of Isenfel and my spirit will poison you! (CLOSE) When they take me, you must escape.\nTURLOUGH: I’m not leaving you. You really are terribly brave. (SOTTO) Or stupid. I’m not sure which.\nSNARLING: BLACK SNOWBEASTS CLOSE IN.\nINGER: It is a good day to meet death, is it not?\nTURLOUGH: I've had better...\nINGER: Come here, Sir Turlough. (GRABS TURLOUGH AND KISSES HIM)\nTURLOUGH: (RELEASED) What was- [that for?]\nINGER: (OVER HIM) Thank you. Now run!\nTURLOUGH: Where to? We’re trapped between the monsters and the edge of the world!\nDISTORTED: ROARS OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS.\nDISTORTED: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL)"

A nursery, beneath my feet? How many?\nROMY: (SETTLING CHILDREN) Sh. Three babes in arms. And four others, all less than three turns old.\nKARLINA: You use the royal palace for your own ends. This litter of children. Who are they? Where did they come from?\nROMY: The villagers were so afraid, majesty... Kendra has no family... if she gives her life, who looks after her little one? Vorn and Kalla, they are barely twenty, now one of them must die for their child... Helga-\nKARLINA: Enough! All in Isenfel know the price we must pay.\nTEGAN: You mean kill off grandpa so the kids can live?\nDOCTOR: Didn’t your uncle cull rabbits to protect his farm? A similar principle. Taken to a ruthless extreme.\nTEGAN: (ANGRY) It’s a little bit different from that!\nNYSSA: But you see the Doctor’s point? That’s why they were so ready to kill to make space for us...\nKARLINA: It is not you who disturb the equilibrium of Isenfel. It is my own people.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: I’m hoping your ‘equilibrium’ can be adjusted. I set the control system to re-calibrate and re-align its parameters according to the current energy levels. At least I think I did...

Come along, you little tykes.\nTEGAN: NYSSA AND TEGAN HELP ROMY GATHER CHILDREN.\nDOCTOR: Good job, Tegan. But Nyssa, I’1ll need your help very soon.\nKARLINA: Romy, afterwards you will arrange an escort for Lady Nyssa to the Balancing Chamber.\nROMY: Yes, highness.

We took what we could, but it was never enough.\nNYSSA: Do you need a hand with that bottle, Tegan?\nTEGAN: (STRUGGLING TO FEED BABY WITH BOTTLE) It’d be easier if the little beggar stopped wriggling.\nNYSSA: Here. Let me show you-\nTEGAN: I can do it! It’s easy for you, you’ve had the practice. (BREAKS OFF, BEAT) Sorry, Nyssa. Opened my mouth without thinking...\nNYSSA: Ct Ss all right.\nTEGAN: I’m a rubbish friend and a rubbish babysitter.\nNYSSA: No, Tegan. Look. He’s settled now. (BEAT) It would have been wonderful to have you around.\nTEGAN: These kids... They should be with their families.\nNYSSA: But we know what their families would have had to do. Make a sacrifice for any new arrival.\nROMY: It is how it has always been.\nTEGAN: I can’t believe it. If you know that’s what happens... why would anyone ever have children?\nNYSSA: Some things can’t be controlled. And once you become a parent, there’s nothing you wouldn’t do to keep them safe.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 78\nROMY: But still, it is so very hard. Especially if you’ve no-one to depend on. To balance with. That is the case for these poor mites.\nNYSSA: But you think here in the palace they’re protected? Shielded somehow?\nROMY: The royal house has always had special privilege, beyond wealth and rank. We do not believe the Balancing casts quite so harsh an eye on this palace.\nTEGAN: You mean the royals don’t pay the same price as everyone else? That figures.\nROMY: They do follow the rules of succession. Queen Karlina has her own sadness to bear. I cannot deny that. But the black snow never falls anywhere near here.\nNYSSA: Black snow?\nROMY: It is how Isenfel takes its payment if we do not balance our own accounts. The black snow falls and destroys all it touches.\nTEGAN: This place gets madder by the second.\nGUARD: ENTERS.\nGUARD: Madam Romy. We were summoned.\nROMY: Lady Nyssa. Your escort.\nNYSSA: (GOING TO DOOR) I need to go to the Doctor. He said he wanted my help. And we still need to work out how to get away from here...\nTEGAN: Go on. I’1l give Romy a hand getting this lot back down to the village.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 79\nNYSSA: Be careful, Tegan.\nTEGAN: You too. I’ll be back as soon as I can.\nNYSSA: (DEPARTING) And you could ask about getting the TARDIS out the ice!\nNYSSA: EXITS ALONG CORRIDOR.\nTEGAN: Of course!

Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR: (LEADING SKARSGARD FROM INNER CHAMBER) That’s it, Karlina. Help me guide him out.\nKARLINA: (HELPING DOCTOR) Skarsgard will recover himself... outside the inner sanctum?\nDOCTOR: That’s what I’m assuming. If we remove him from the core environment, his programming should revert...\nSKARSGARD: (GASPING — SUDDENLY HIMSELF AGAIN) My Queen... My Queen... I am sorry... SO very sorry. You... your family have been deceived all this time. I am not what you thought me to be...\nKARLINA: You have nothing to apologise for, Balancer Skarsgard. You are still the same man.\nSKARSGARD: But I am not a man. I am no subject of yours my lady.\nKARLINA: You are. You are my family’s oldest and truest friend.\nDOCTOR: You realise what you’ve been doing? Culling your subjects. Under orders from the people who put these controls in place. But from what I can tell, they’re long gone.\nSKARSGARD: I have ordered the deaths of... so many... over generations. It has all been my doing.\nDOCTOR: I suppose, in a way, you’ve kept this place going. If life had run riot, everything inside the atmosphere bubble would have just been wiped out.\nKARLINA: We obey because that is how our lives have always been here. Listen, Skarsgard. There’s nothing else we could have done.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: That’s the trouble when you’re trapped inside a system. You can’t see any other way...\nICE: DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Doctor. You wanted my help?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (LEADING NYSSA TO INNER CHAMBER) Excuse us a moment, Karlina.

NYSSA AND DOCTOR ENTER.\nDOCTOR: (LEADING NYSSA TO CONTROLS) I need you to... check my working, as it were.\nNYSSA: Me, Doctor? What can I do?\nDOCTOR: (USING CONTROLS) Here. It’s all quite logical. Isenfel is an experimental environment. Artificial atmosphere, simulated night and day, locked inside a sealed force-field.\nNYSSA: I see. This is the map you were talking about.\nHOLOGRAPHIC: MAP ACTIVATES\nDOCTOR: You weren’t wrong when you guessed the locals had a limited gene pool. These people are lab rats. Only the laboratory's been abandoned, and the experiment left running.\nNYSSA: And what was this... experiment testing?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Energy monitoring and conservation? It’s a closed system with automatic controls in place to keep things constant. To maintain this ‘Equilibrium’ that everyone believes in.\nNYSSA: (USING CONTROLS) I see. You’ve started a recalibration.\nDOCTOR: I think I’ve set the system to stabilise, to allow for everything as it currently stands. Then I can work out how to Switch it off. Just.. look things over and tell me if you agree I’m on the right track.\nNYSSA: And what about the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Ah. (DEMONSTRATING CONTROLS) This is an energy monitor. Now, what do you think is the biggest source of untapped energy in this kingdom?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 83\nNYSSA: Of course!\nDOCTOR: Only the system doesn’t recognise it. I thought you might try adjusting the scanners. Carefully.\nNYSSA: And what will you be doing in the meantime?\nDOCTOR: Talking to Skarsgard. He’s had a shock.\nNYSSA: What about Solus, and the interface stabiliser?\nDOCTOR: (GOES TO DOORWAY) I’ve not forgotten. — So. You’re happy with what you’ve got to do?\nNYSSA: Not ‘happy’ exactly... But I’ll try.\nDOCTOR: I know that feeling well. (BEAT) Am I making things better? I don’t know, Nyssa. I just don’t know.\nNYSSA: You’re changing things. Surely that’s better than how it was?\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope so. (EXITING)\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: EXT.

I’ve got one being sick back here!\nJESPER: (CALLING FROM DRIVER'S SEAT) We fed them too well, I think!\nROMY: Here. (HANDING TEGAN CLOTHS) It is not much further. We ride through the pass and the village is beyond.\nTEGAN: (MOPPING UP) I don’t suppose you’ve a change of clothes at your place? For me I mean.\nJESPER: Nothing like these strange garments you wear now!\nTEGAN: It’d be good to get out of these overalls. Let me guess. I can have anything so long as it’s white fur?\nROMY: The new day is dawning. By the time it is light, the children will be back with their families.\nTEGAN: They all handed them over to you willingly?\nJESPER: It had to be done quickly before the Balancer was alerted.\nTEGAN: But still, they must trust you both.\nROMY: Jesper has been a village elder for many years. And the Princess’s tracker for longer. He is respected.\nJESPER: Hush, woman. You are well-loved by the people. Romy’s work in the palace kitchens meant we both had access.\nTEGAN: And you kept them there. For years. Right under the Balancer’s nose.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 85\nJESPER: We get help from those we trust, but it gets harder. I do not know what we would have done as they grew older.\nROMY: We may not have seen that future. I almost didn’t see this dawn.\nTEGAN: Yes. I’m sorry. We’ve brought you a whole load of trouble.\nROMY: No, you bring something else.\nJESPER: Something new. Change.\nTEGAN: I just hope it’s change for the better.\nBABY: CRIES.\nTEGAN: Talking of change. (SNIFFS) Anyone got any nappies?\nROMY: I shall attend to it.\nTEGAN: Hey. Am I imagining it, or does the sky look a funny colour?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. BALANCING CHAMBER\nHUM: B/G IN INNER CHAMBER AS DOCTOR EMERGES\nDOCTOR: Queen Karlina. How is your Balancer?\nKARLINA: He went to his quarters.\nDOCTOR: Really, I’d rather we kept him close at hand...\nKARLINA: Skarsgard needs time to recover himself. I do not fully understand all you have shown us. But his whole life has been torn apart.\nDOCTOR: Of course. It’s a lot to take in.\nKARLINA: And I have no idea what I should be doing...\nDOCTOR: There is something, which may be a welcome distraction.\nKARLINA: Yes?\nDOCTOR: My craft. It slipped beneath the ice when we arrived.\nKARLINA: Beneath the ice? Anything that falls to Isenfel stays on the surface until the black snow takes it.\nDOCTOR: Luckily for me, my ship was losing power into the vortex. If it had been the other way around, well, I imagine there’d have been quite a flurry of your black snow.\nKARLINA: Losing power?\nDOCTOR: But it should have stabilised. It’s down there somewhere. Nyssa is finding out exactly where.\nKARLINA: I will have my people assist. We have tools we can use to cut the ice.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR: Thank you. And I’ve something else to find too. Something Solus had with him. Perhaps it was left in his shipwreck?\nSKARSGARD: (AT DOORWAY) That wreck is gone.\nDOCTOR: Skarsgard.\nKARLINA: Lord Balancer. Are you rested?\nSKARSGARD: (ENTERING) No, my lady. I don’t believe I will ever rest again.\nDOCTOR: I realise this must be a difficult time, but it’s vitally important I recover an item that Solus had with him.\nSKARSGARD: His vessel is destroyed. Lost to the black snow. But I believe I know the object you seek...\nDOCTOR: Then please, will you-\nSKARSGARD: (INTERRUPTING) No! First, you will explain to me. Doctor. You who fell to our world with all the answers. First you will tell me.. what I am!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: EXT.

It’s rather like a great big petri dish.\nINGER: All in Isenfel must be willing to make the sacrifice.\nTURLOUGH: It certainly brings families closer. (SOTTO) A lot closer than mine at any rate.\nINGER: You think so? I never knew my grandfather. He had to die so I could live. That was his gift to me, and I will not waste it.\nTURLOUGH: (STOPPING) Do you think we can rest? There’s been no sign of those beasts. Black or white. And look. It’s getting lighter.\nINGER: (STOPPING) I know... But I have never seen a dawn like this one.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t know what to expect next in this place...\nINGER: Remember, at the edge of the world? The colour changed. It has given the sky a sickly hue.\nINGER: WATERFALL OF DISTORTION INCREASES IN PITCH, COMES SLOWLY CLOSER.\nINGER: Get up, Sir Turlough. We cannot rest.\nTURLOUGH: Please. Just a few minutes-\nINGER: No. Not even one. It is still a long way to the palace. And we have no time to spare. Do you not feel it?\nTURLOUGH: Feel what?\nINGER: The edge of our kingdom is coming closer.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 89\nTURLOUGH: The edge of-? (BREAKS OFF, REALISING) Of course... It’s an energy barrier... The TARDIS crossed it to land. That’s what’s surrounding this place...\nCRACKLING: DISTORTION OVERHEAD.\nINGER: Listen. And look. Lightning that sparks across the sky, never coming to ground. This too is something I have never seen.\nTURLOUGH: It could be shorting out. And if the whole energy barrier’s contracting...\nINGER: That is what I said. The end of our world is coming closer.\nTURLOUGH: (SETTING OFF) You’ve convinced me. Come on, we need to move.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: EXT. VILLAGE\nDOCTOR WHO: TEGAN, ROMY AND JESPER WALKING OVER SNOW. A CHILD HAPPILY RUNS TO ITS PARENTS.\nTEGAN: That’s it. Everyone from your nursery, reunited with their folks. Happy families.\nJESPER: But for how long?\nROMY: We were fools to think we could change anything. That we could go against the Balancing.\nTEGAN: The Doctor will think of something. I’m sure he will.\nJESPER: We cannot fight the rules of Isenfel. Perhaps we have lived too long already, Romy. Perhaps we should have just made way.\nTEGAN: You don’t have any kids yourselves?\nROMY: No. We were never blessed.\nJESPER: Or cursed. Since if we had, then one of us...\nTEGAN: Yeah. Right. I don’t know how you can live like this.\nJESPER: It is all we know.\nROMY: There is no other way. We live with the certainty of death.\nTEGAN: But doesn’t that make you want to fight back?\nJESPER: It did. But look what happened.\nROMY: We tried. But now we know there is no other way. The Balancing is as constant as the ice beneath our feet. (RESIGNED) Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 91\nJESPER: (RESIGNED) Isenfel be constant. Follow, Lady Tegan.

ICE GARDEN\nPEOPLE: WALKING OVER ICE, SCRAPING AND CUTTING INTO ICE.\nNYSSA: Thank you for your assistance, your majesty.\nKARLINA: The Doctor and Skarsgard have things to discuss. They are best left alone.\nNYSSA: I agree. I wasn’t entirely sure what those systems were telling me, but there was definitely something here.\nKARLINA: Just outside my palace walls. In our ice gardens.\nNYSSA: The sculptures are incredible in their detail.\nKARLINA: We were so very proud of our craftsmen. But now, all this art means so... little.\nNYSSA: On the contrary, your highness. I can tell everything in Isenfel has meaning to you. The palace itself is a magnificent structure. Elegant in its simplicity. And so very beautiful.\nKARLINA: You have a regal bearing, Lady Nyssa. Unlike your friends. Am I right in thinking you are from noble stock?\nNYSSA: It’s a very long time ago now. I’ve come to learn it doesn’t really matter who your parents are. It’s what they teach you.\nKARLINA: You are wise beyond your years. You and the Doctor, you have the eyes of older souls.\nNYSSA: I’m a lot older than I look. The Doctor too. (ASIDE) I’m starting to realise how he sometimes feels. (TO KARLINA) I’ve been travelling for a long time... But I’m ready to stop. That’s where we differ.\nKARLINA: You believe in him. As I believed in Skarsgard...\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 93\nNYSSA: I do. The Doctor is a good man. He will always try and make a difference.\nSHOUTS: OFF.\nPEOPLE: Here! I see it!\nKARLINA: My hunters have found something.\nNYSSA: The energy locater was right. I didn’t believe it at first. We arrived much further out. Beyond those ice-ridges.\nKARLINA: My palace has always been at the centre of things. People and things are drawn to it.\nNYSSA: Maybe that’s it. While the TARDIS was losing energy, Isenfel’s control systems pulled it in towards the palace so they could work out what it was.\nKARLINA: If this machine can do all you claim, then it may prove useful.\nNYSSA: Oh yes. The TARDIS can be very useful indeed.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT.

How does this not disturb the balance?\nDOCTOR: You’re the monitor. You’re outside the parameters of the system. I need to give your workings a jolt to see them clearly.\nSKARSGARD: (FX) This ‘jolt’ will... cause pain?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so, yes. I have to access the shell program. There’s something behind it.

VILLAGERS MOVING OUT ALONG ICE-PATH WITH CARTS, HORSES.\nTEGAN: (LEADING HORSE) Right. Give me a leg up, Jesper.\nJESPER: Lars says this stallion is good-tempered. It should serve you well. (HELPING TEGAN MOUNT) You are sure, Lady Tegan?\nTEGAN: (SETTLING HERSELF ON SADDLE) I’m sure all right. Romy bought us some time. You need to get your people away, and I need to find my friend. He’s lost out there somewhere.\nJESPER: You don’t know where.\nTEGAN: I can follow tracks in the snow. The hunt left enough of a trail. No-one else was heading their way last night.\nJESPER: If you cannot be turned from this...\nTEGAN: No. I can’t. (BEAT) Thanks Jesper. I know it’s hard losing Romy like that. But we’ve got to look after the ones still here. You can mourn her later.\nJESPER: You are right, Lady Tegan. Go, and may Isenfel grant you the\nJESPER: time.\nTEGAN: Good luck to you too! Yah! (SPURS HORSE ON)\nTEGAN: GALLOPS OFF.\nJESPER: (TO SELF) I am sick of death’s victories this night. I will not see it win another.\nJESPER: RUNS TOWARDS OTHERS.\nJESPER: (CALLING) Lars! Fetch me a horse!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: INGER AND TURLOUGH RUNNING. A WATERFALL OF DISTORTION FOLLOWS\nINGER: The palace... I see the palace at last.\nTURLOUGH: Good. Because I’d swear that barrier is moving faster.\nINGER: And look. It is not just closing in. See what is spilling from ao\nTURLOUGH: Oh no, our black furry friends are back. In force.\nMANY: BLACK SNOWBEASTS ROARING AND SNARLING IN DISTANCE.\nINGER: Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. INNER BALANCING CHAMBER\nHOLOGRAPHIC: SYSTEMS AND ALARMS TINKLING AND HUMMING, BUILDING THROUGH IN B/G.\nDOCTOR: (SHAKING SKARSGARD) Come on... Skarsgard! Speak to me!\nDOCTOR: DASHES TO CONTROL BANKS. NYSSA RUNS IN.\nNYSSA: (CALLING) Doctor! We’ve found the TARDIS! It got dragged in towards central control. They’re digging for it in the palace garden!\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED, HITTING CONTROLS) Good... good. Though that’s rather like finding a deflated lifejacket on the Titanic...\nNYSSA: What’s wrong? What’s happened to the Balancer?\nDOCTOR: He’s stopped responding. (CROSSING TO OTHER CONTROLS) And Isenfel’s bubble is shrinking.\nNYSSA: The energy transduction barrier, you mean? I thought you’d stabilised everything.\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING TO ANOTHER CONTROL BANK) So did I. But it seems all I managed to do was stave off the inevitable. What was I thinking? You can’t make a bargain with entropy. Every system will always tend towards collapse.\nNYSSA: Can’t you try recalibrating again?\nDOCTOR: It seems any process within the experiment can be run once and once only.\nNYSSA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Isenfel is an artificial environment created to simulate the collapse of E-Space. I’ve triggered the shut-down. And now I can’t stop it.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 104\nNYSSA: There’s nothing you can do?\nDOCTOR: (USING CONTROLS) Not any more. The closed system is disintegrating, venting its energy out into the rest of this universe.\nNYSSA: There must be something!\nDOCTOR: I’ve already done too much. Don’t you see Nyssa? I thought I was saving the people of Isenfel. Instead, I’ve condemned them all to die!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 105"

Revolution?\nTURLOUGH: No. I think they’re saving themselves. Look what’s behind them.\nINGER: Black snowstorms, sweeping over the ice-plains.\nTURLOUGH: While we’ve got black snowbeasts and the edge of the world after us. We need to warn them what else is coming.\nTURLOUGH: THEY START SLIPPING AND SLIDING DOWN RIDGE.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: INT.

I’m trying to secure the integrity of the atmosphere bubble, but it’s impossible to find a balance!\nNYSSA: Can’t you reverse what you’ve done, put the system back to how it was?\nDOCTOR: I can’t do anything, Nyssa! Reverse it, accelerate it, switch it off! All the protocols are locked.\nNYSSA: Doctor. The TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: What about it?\nNYSSA: Queen Karlina’s people will have it out of the ice soon.\nDOCTOR: We can’t just leave! Even if we wanted to, the [stabiliser]-\nNYSSA: (INTERRUPTING) But we could shelter! There’s nothing more we can do here. Is there?\nNYSSA: THE DOCTOR GOES TO LIFT SKARSGARD.\nDOCTOR: Help me with Skarsgard. We still need to find that interface stabiliser. (EFFORT — LIFTING SKARSGARD)\nNYSSA: (HELPING LIFT SKARSGARD) You think he knows something?\nNYSSA: DOCTOR AND NYSSA CARRY SKARSGARD TOWARDS OUTER CHAMBER.\nSKARSGARD: (FX) Isenfel be constant. Isenfel be constant.\nDOCTOR: (WITH EFFORT) Carry him into the outer chamber, we might get him talking again.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 107\nNYSSA: (CARRYING SKARSGARD THROUGH) I hope we can. The TARDIS is useless without that component.\nFOLLOW: THEM TO OUTER CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Here will do.

You didn’t have to come after me, you know.\nJESPER: When your world falls apart, you need something to cling to.\nTEGAN: You didn’t have to.. But I’m glad you did. (BEAT) I’m sorry about Romy. I could see you loved each other very much.\nJESPER: We did. And I will honour her memory by doing what I can to help you. And your friends.\nTEGAN: Right... I followed the hunting party’s tracks... but look. They seem to lead straight towards that wall of... whatever it is.\nJESPER: The world’s end.\nTEGAN: Is that what you call it? It looks like some kind of force field?\nJESPER: No. It truly is the end of our world. The edge of everything. But it is closer than I have ever seen it before. I fear your friend, and the Princess, may have passed over to the other Side.\nTEGAN: Turlough can’t be gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 109\nJESPER: (RECONSIDERING) But, the edge is moving... (REALISATION) The ground has vanished where they passed!\nTEGAN: The one thing you need to know about Turlough is, he’s very good at looking after his own sorry hide. He’1ll have found another way back.\nJESPER: Then we need to find where their tracks re-appear.\nJESPER: CRACKS OF THUNDER. SPARKS CRACKLING ACROSS THE SKY.\nTEGAN: What was that? Lightning?\nJESPER: Never mind the skies, Lady Tegan. Look what else is at the edge. Where the blackness melts the ice away.\nJESPER: DISTORTED, SNARLING GROWLING, OFF.\nTEGAN: Are they... snowbeasts? Coming out of that barrier?\nJESPER: Aye. But of a kind I’ve not seen before.\nTEGAN: They're... black.\nJESPER: Come on. We should get to high ground. We shall see more from there. Yah!\nJESPER: SPURS HIS HORSE ON.

I would not want the end to come without you.\nTURLOUGH: (ARRIVING) Your majesty. I see you found the TARDIS. The blue box?\nKARLINA: TARDIS, yes. That is what the Doctor called it.\nTURLOUGH: Where is he now, your majesty?\nKARLINA: Inside the palace with our Lord Balancer and your friend. He seeks to divine the mysteries of Isenfel, but they perplex him.\nTURLOUGH: Well if he doesn’t know what’s going on, we haven’t a hope.\nINGER: The edge of the world is moving, mother. It is like the walls of our kingdom are closing in.\nKARLINA: And the black snow is ravaging the lands beyond the ice- mountain. I have allowed the villagers to take shelter in the palace.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 111\nINGER: So this is what we do as the world ends? We run? We hide?\nTURLOUGH: I can heartily recommend it as a method of self-preservation. At least until a better option comes along.\nKARLINA: And can you offer any better option, Sir Turlough? You and your friends?\nTURLOUGH: There is the TARDIS. If there really is no hope, it could get us away from here.\nINGER: I do not see how you four can fit inside it, let alone all of Isenfel!\nTURLOUGH: No. And at the moment, it’s probably out of the question. It was damaged, you see.\nINGER: That blue box could take us to safety?\nTURLOUGH: When it’s working properly, the TARDIS can take you anywhere you like.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT.

He’s completely unconscious.\nNYSSA: Perhaps the shutdown has affected him already?\nDOCTOR: (GETTING UP, PACING) It’s no good, Nyssa. I’ve only made things worse. Now I have to go and tell those people their world is ending, and it’s all my fault!\nNYSSA: You didn’t start this experiment, Doctor. You didn’t imprison these people. You can’t shoulder the blame for everything.\nDOCTOR: But I can for some things. (BEAT) You know that better than most, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: There was nothing we could do about Adric. Either Adric.\nDOCTOR: You’ve lost everything because of me.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. You helped me carry on despite losing everything.\nDOCTOR: That’s very noble of you to say, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: You have no idea, do you? The effect you have? You upset the balance for the best. There’s no equilibrium with you. You’1l always tip the scales in everyone’s favour but your own.\nDOCTOR: It just doesn’t feel that way at the moment.\nNYSSA: You do realise that in the long term, this universe is collapsing at a far faster rate than our own.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR: Yes. E-Space is doomed. But then, in the even longer term, so’s N-Space. And that doesn’t stop me trying, does it? (WALKING TO\nINNER: CHAMBER) Ask the Queen to meet me in her hall.\nNYSSA: (GOING TO DOOR) You’1ll think of something, Doctor. You always do.\nDOCTOR: (AT INNER DOORWAY) You know, I could try and improvise something from these components. Some kind of dimensional regulator... It may be compatible.\nNYSSA: There. I knew you weren’t beaten!\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Nyssa. If there’s anything I can do for these people, then I’1l1 do it.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: TEGAN AND JESPER RIDING TO HIGHER GROUND. DISTORTION AND CRACKLING OF BARRIER.\nJESPER: Hold here, Lady Tegan, at the top of the ridge! (THEY STOP.) I see every horizon. The kingdom is so small now...\nTEGAN: It’s like being inside a snow-globe. Only the glass is shrinking.\nJESPER: I do not think there is anyone else out on the ice-plains. We should go back to the palace.\nDISTORTED: GROWLS OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS BELOW. LOUDER CRACKLING IN SKY.\nTEGAN: I think Rover and his friends might have something to say about that.\nJESPER: I have arrows. They are not attacking yet. Perhaps we could make our way through if I first clear a path.\nLOUDER: CRACKLES AS BARRIER IS BREACHED BY PIRATE SHIP CUTTING\nFROM: OUTSIDE.\nJESPER: The skies are angry too.\nCRACKLES: CONTINUE, EXPLOSION ABOVE.\nTEGAN: Hang on.. That’s not just lightning. There’s something coming through the barrier!\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS DISTORTED HOWLS LOUDER, START TO APPROACH.\nJESPER: Whatever it is, the black snowbeasts do not like it.\nSKY: CRACKS OPEN. ‘PIRATE SHIP’ DESCENDS — FX AS IN THE ENTROPY\nTEGAN: I’1l tell you what it is.. It’s a ship!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. PALACE HALL\nFOOTSTEPS: INTO HALL AS NYSSA AND TURLOUGH ENTER.\nNYSSA: Well I’m glad you’re all right, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I very nearly wasn’t. Have you any idea what’s going on out there?\nNYSSA: We’ve some idea, yes. This whole world is an experiment that’s shutting itself down. Actually, have you seen-\nNYSSA: THEY STOP. INGER CATCHES UP, FOLLOWED BY KARLINA.\nINGER: (INTERRUPTING) Sir Turlough! Tell my mother what you said to me. About the Doctor’s ship.\nKARLINA: It does not make any difference, Inger.\nTURLOUGH: Well, I only said that it could travel a long way.\nDOCTOR: ENTERS FROM CORRIDOR.\nINGER: I mean about it holding vast dimensions inside. Huge spaces you\nINGER: said!\nDOCTOR: Have you been boasting, Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: The size doesn’t matter. And certainly not at the moment. Good to see you made it back in one piece, all the same. — Thank\nDOCTOR: you, Princess Inger, for looking after Turlough. Even if it has made him a little too eager to give away our secrets.\nTURLOUGH: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) It doesn’t matter. Because that’s what I’m offering.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 116\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: We may not be able to get far without that stabiliser, but the\nTARDIS: can still be a safe haven.\nNYSSA: But what about the dimensional integrity-\nDOCTOR: (HOLDS UP COMPONENT) As the Balancing systems were shutting down, I managed to piece together a regulator from some of the parts.\nDOCTOR: CLICKS COMPONENT. IT HUMS INTERMITTENTLY\nDOCTOR: It should be compatible with the TARDIS. It will at least hold the internal dimensions together while we investigate... er... alternative solutions.\nTURLOUGH: Will it be safe?\nDOCTOR: Certainly safer than staying out here. Now. Nine thousand five hundred and eighty-two people? Give or take a few extra children. Yes. There’1ll be plenty of room.\nTURLOUGH: You can’t be serious.\nKARLINA: We must consider this carefully.\nINGER: What is to consider, mother? We have to do this. Or die.\nKARLINA: We do not abandon our kingdom. I thought a daughter of the royal house of Isenfel would know that.\nINGER: I know when our kingdom is lost. You didn’t see the wall of nothingness that is coming towards us.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. See how Skarsgard is doing.\nNYSSA: Yes Doctor. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: You two — Turlough, Inger. Round up the villagers. As soon as the TARDIS is free of the ice I’1l install the regulator and we can start loading people on board.\nINGER: Come on Sir Turlough. (EXITS)\nTURLOUGH: I’m still not sure it’s a good idea. (FOLLOWING)\nKARLINA: I have not yet given my approval.\nDOCTOR: I think you’ve had quite enough say over your people’s lives already, Karlina.\nKARLINA: I am queen of Isenfel still.\nDOCTOR: Then you don’t have a choice, ‘your majesty’. Not if you want to have anything left to rule.\nKARLINA: Isenfel is dying.\nDOCTOR: A kingdom consists of its people, not its land. I can simply take them all somewhere else.\nKARLINA: No. I shall think on this. Isenfel has been my life. I cannot abandon it so easily.\nDOCTOR: Don’t think for too long. We haven’t much time.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HALL\nNYSSA: WALKING, FOOTSTEPS IN CORRIDOR AHEAD.\nNYSSA: Hello? Is there someone there?\nNYSSA: CATCHES UP WITH SKARSGARD.\nNYSSA: Balancer Skarsgard. I couldn’t find you in the Balancing Chamber. Were you outside the hall all along?\nSKARSGARD: I know these corridors well. Every turn... every hiding place.\nNYSSA: You should have come in. We wanted to ask-\nSKARSGARD: (INTERRUPTS) No. No, I heard all that was said. I have no place there. Not among... people.\nNYSSA: What do you mean? They’re your people. Lord Balancer, are you feeling all right?\nSKARSGARD: I do not know. Does a machine feel?\nNYSSA: You’re not just a machine. You can learn. In principle, my organic brain is only a sophisticated learning machine.\nSKARSGARD: The Doctor said something similar. (SEARCHING ROBES) lI.. have something for him. For you all. The metal disc with the red glowing centre. (TAKING COMPONENT FROM ROBES)\nSTABILISER: HUMS AS IN MISTFALL\nNYSSA: The interface stabiliser!\nSKARSGARD: (HANDING HER COMPONENT) Here. It will enable your own machine to work?\nNYSSA: Yes. You don’t know what this means. We can save everyone!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 119\nSKARSGARD: Good. Good. You and the Doctor do what you can. I will do the same. (WALKS AWAY) I serve Isenfel to the last.\nSKARSGARD: WALKS OFF ALONG CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: But... you can come too. (CALLING) Balancer Skarsgard! Where are you going?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: INT. BALANCING CHAMBER\nTINKLING: WHIRRING OF INNER HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS B/G. KARLINA TOYS WITH LOOSE METAL COGS AND WHEELS. WALKS ACROSS CHAMBER,\nDISCARDING: THEM.\nKARLINA: (TO SELF) What would you say, father?\nKARLINA: SKARSGARD’S FOOTSTEPS IN CORRIDOR.\nKARLINA: (TO SELF) And you, Gustav. What would you do?\nSKARSGARD: (ENTERING) You have honoured their memories, Karlina. I know they would both be proud.\nKARLINA: Skarsgard. You are recovered?\nSKARSGARD: No. And I do not think I ever shall be.\nKARLINA: I know that feeling all too well. The first time was when my father departed. Again, after my husband.\nSKARSGARD: They did their duty. They faced death with nobility. Princess Inger is a fine woman. She does your father credit.\nKARLINA: And then, there was another time... (BEAT) Erik.\nSKARSGARD: The young prince... It was... The sickness was... (BEAT) Well... we do not know what is planned for us.\nKARLINA: When I lost Erik. When I lost my child... It made me question everything. He left such a hole in the world.\nSKARSGARD: There was space for another life. Among the villagers. A girl, if I remember. I do not quite recall the name. I am losing so much now.\nKARLINA: But in my world, in here, I will always miss him. Yet he will always be with me. An absence and a presence. Is that... equilibrium?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 121\nSKARSGARD: If the Balancing taught us anything... the briefer the time we have, the more precious. And I have lived far, far too long. (BEAT) This is where I end, my lady.\nKARLINA: (SOTTO) Where we all end. (BEAT) The Doctor offers us sanctuary. I cannot take it. But I cannot order my subjects to do the same.\nSKARSGARD: I have been ordering their deaths for... centuries.\nKARLINA: You did not know.. We did not know any other way. But now. The veil is lifted. We see what we have done. I cannot rule those whose mothers’ and fathers’ blood is on my hands.\nSKARSGARD: Ask them. Speak to Inger. I.. will remain. Take the Gauge. It may prove useful yet.\nSKARSGARD: PASSES CLICKING GAUGE TO KARLINA.\nKARLINA: Thank you. (WALKING TO EXIT) You have been my oldest and my truest friend, Skarsgard. I thank you for your service.\nSKARSGARD: The Doctor said my heart was a perpetual machine. But now, I feel it breaking.\nKARLINA: My heart is become ice. It.. had to. But that world is past.\nSKARSGARD: I will do what I can here. To give them time. Whatever you decide, remember me, my lady.\nKARLINA: I shall, Lord Balancer. Isenfel be constant.\nKARLINA: WALKS AWAY.\nSKARSGARD: Isenfel be.. constant. (TO SELF) As constant as its queen.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: EXT.

This... blue box.\nNYSSA: There’s so much more to the TARDIS than how it looks. As your men on the ropes could tell.\nTARDIS: CRUNCHES ONTO GROUND.\nDOCTOR: That’s it! She’s safe. (WALKS OVER) Stay back, everyone. It’1l still be dangerous until I’ve installed the stabiliser.\nKARLINA: (JUST OFF) The Doctor has all he requires?\nNYSSA: (WALKING OVER TO HER) You should tell your people, we'll be ready to take them on board soon.\nKARLINA: I have been in council. I am come to inform you. They may leave, but I will not.\nNYSSA: But the Doctor can take you anywhere. In this universe or even... somewhere else. Somewhere safe.\nKARLINA: Isenfel is my home. I stay. After all I have done, I do not belong in my people’s future.\nNYSSA: And Princess Inger? What does she think?\nKARLINA: Inger accepts the responsibility of her office. Her reign will be a new way of life. One I do not know.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING) Nyssa! We’ve got trouble! You need to come back to the palace!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 125\nDISTORTED: SNARLING, SNAPPING OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS APPROACHING\nOVER: RIDGE.\nNYSSA: Oh no.\nALL: RUN AS BLACK SNOWBEASTS SWARM INTO ICE GARDEN.\nINGER: (CALLING) The black snowbeasts! Everyone! Stay back!\nNYSSA: They’ve surrounded the TARDIS!\nKARLINA: What are they?\nNYSSA: Automatic matter dispersal. If the black snow’s not efficient enough, I imagine this method’s a little more direct.\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING UP) We saw what they can do out on the ice plains. It isn’t pretty. Where’s the Doctor?\nNYSSA: Inside the TARDIS. We should warn him.\nINGER: (RUNNING UP) Even I cannot loose enough arrows to stop them.\nKARLINA: They are not attacking. They pace around your blue box.\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS DISTORTED GROWLS.\nNYSSA: Oh no. What’s got the strongest energy signature here?\nTURLOUGH: The TARDIS.\nNYSSA: You don’t think they’1ll try and-.\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS POUNCE AT TARDIS. DISTORTED THUDS AND HOWLS.\nTURLOUGH: No.. They can’t break through... Can they?\nSNOWBEASTS: HURL THEMSELVES AT DOORS. DISTORTED TARDIS SOUND.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 126\nNYSSA: The shell’s already weak... I think they’re destroying it!\nTURLOUGH: But the Doctor’s in there!\nGROUND: TREMORS START.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: B/G HUM. TARDIS ROCKED BY BLACK SNOWBEAST ATTACKS\nDOCTOR: (GRIPPING CONSOLE) Come on, old girl. Your shell should be regenerating. What’s stopping you? (ACTIVATES MONITOR)\nMONITOR: SHOWS GROWLING BLACK SNOWBEASTS ATTACKING TARDIS OUTSIDE. SPARKING AND ALARMS ON CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: (USING CONTROLS) Oh no... And while the dimensions are phased...\nDOCTOR: CRACKLING OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS APPEARING IN CONSOLE ROOM, ROARING.\nDOCTOR: They can get inside...\nDISTORTED: ROARS CLOSER.\nDOCTOR: Get away! Get away from the console! (BEAT, BACKING AWAY) Oh, but you can’t, can you... It’s the biggest energy source this world has ever seen. So you have to destroy it!\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS ROAR, LEAPING AT CONSOLE — SPARKS AND\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: CRACKLING OF BARRIER CONTINUES. PIRATE SHIP ENGINES AS IT LIFTS OFF. JESPER RIDES TOWARDS IT AS BLACK SNOWBEASTS GROWL\nJESPER: (FIRING ARROWS) Lady Tegan! No!!\nSKY: CRACKS OPEN AGAIN AND SHIP JETS OFF THROUGH THE CRACK.\nJESPER: The ship is gone!\nGROUND: SHAKES.\nJESPER: Now the ground shakes... This cannot be that vessel’s doing?\nJESPER: HUM OF BARRIER RISES IN PITCH. BLACK BEASTS START HOWLING.\nJESPER: No. Something else is happening. I do not understand!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71: EXT. ICE GARDEN\nGROUND: TREMORS BUILDING. DISTORTED HOWLING OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS\nATTACKING: TARDIS.\nNYSSA: That howling, it’s horrible!\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING, OFF) They’re destroying the TARDIS! And when they’re finished, they’1l come for us. Come on Nyssa, back to the palace!\nNYSSA: But, the Doctor-\nNYSSA: RUMBLING, CRACKING ICE\nINGER: (CALLING) Is this an earthquake?\nNYSSA: (CALLING) Inger! Turlough! Get away from the statues!\nICE: STATUE SHAKES AND FALLS, SMASHING TO PIECES.\nKARLINA: The death throes of my kingdom...\nNYSSA: Surely it’s too soon for total collapse?\nNYSSA: CRACKLING OF EQUILIBRIUM GAUGE.\nKARLINA: (WALKING TOWARDS TARDIS) My kingdom... These monsters have no place in it.\nINGER: (CALLING) Go Turlough! Keep the people inside. (RUNS TO KARLINA)\nINGER: Mother! What are you doing?\nINGER: CRACKLING OF EQUILIBRIUM GAUGE. BLACK SNOWBEASTS STOP ATTACKING TARDIS AND GROWL.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 130\nKARLINA: See how the Gauge of Equilibrium glows. It has power. Power enough to control these beasts.\nKARLINA: WALKS AWAY, WAVING CRACKLING GAUGE THROUGH\nINGER: It’s true... They follow you...\nKARLINA: Here, I say who lives and who dies. (SWIPES WITH GAUGE)\nBLACK: SNOWBEASTS HOWL AT HER.\nNYSSA: Of course. The Gauge is part of the control system... They’re\nNYSSA: responding.\nKARLINA: (WALKING AWAY, CALLING) I am your queen and you will follow me!\nKARLINA: Rule well, daughter!\nGROWLING: BLACK SNOWBEASTS FOLLOW KARLINA UP RIDGE.\nINGER: She leads the beasts away. Back over the ridge. Your box is safe.\nTARDIS: DOORS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: (EXITING TARDIS) Thank you. It was getting a little heated in\nDOCTOR: there.\nNYSSA: Doctor! Is the TARDIS damaged?\nDOCTOR: She needs a little time to recover. We both do.\nGROUND: TREMORS. DISTORTED HOWLING OF BLACK SNOWBEASTS IN DISTANCE.\nNYSSA: Queen Karlina...\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) ..is doing what she had to. We need to hurry, collect everyone from the palace.\nDOCTOR: THEY SET OFF OVER QUAKING GROUND.\nDOCTOR: and\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 131\nNYSSA: Inger. I’m sorry.\nINGER: Do not be. Mother already passed the crown. She said the people already know a better way. We should live it.\nGROUND: TREMORS SUDDENLY HALT — A RINGING SILENCE.\nNYSSA: Wait!\nINGER: Is this it? This... silence? Is Isenfel ending?\nNYSSA: No... Skarsgard!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: When he gave me the stabiliser. He was going to the Balancing chamber...\nFAINT: ENERGY PULSES BEGIN.\nDOCTOR: Oh... But that’s... brilliant! Quite, quite brilliant!\nINGER: What is? (GASPS) Isenfel be constant, the sky!\nNYSSA: Your energy barrier’s lighting up! It’s expanding...\nNYSSA: PULSING, TINKLING RHYTHMIC ENERGY PULSES BUILD.\nDOCTOR: Skarsgard’s plugged himself back into the control system. He’s discharging his power-core.\nNYSSA: Can he do that?\nDOCTOR: It was meant to keep him running for centuries. But he knows those systems better than anyone. Even if he didn’t realise till now.\nINGER: Balancer Skarsgard has done this to our sky?\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: He’s given Isenfel a new lease of life. His own.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72: INT. INNER BALANCING CHAMBER\nTINKLING: SYSTEMS BUILDING ALL THROUGH.\nSKARSGARD: (STRAINED) Isenfel be constant... Isenfel be constant... Isenfel be constant... no more.\nSKARSGARD: (CALLING IN TRIUMPH) Isenfel be free!\nSKARSGARD: SKARSGARD AND THE CONTROL CHAMBER DISINTEGRATE AND REFORM IN\nSHIMMERING: ICE.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73: EXT. ICE GARDEN\nTINKLING: SUFFUSION OF LIGHT ENERGY SPREADING ACROSS EVERYTHING.\nNYSSA: Look under the ice. Pulses of power. Like ripples of energy.\nDOCTOR: Ripples flowing out from the palace. Centred on the Balancing Chamber... On the Balancer himself.\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING UP) The people are asking what’s happened.\nINGER: Isenfel’s realm is restored. We live. Our people live.\nNYSSA: And the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Fully recovered.\nTURLOUGH: We can get back to N-Space?\nDOCTOR: We can. Now, your majesty, if you rally your men, we can right some of these statues before we go. It would be a terrible shame to leave them in this state. The unbroken ones anyway. I’1l lend a hand.\nNYSSA: But Doctor. Shouldn’t we- [get on our way?]\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. Could you make sure the Balancing Chamber is offline?\nDOCTOR: Throw me one of those ropes, would you?\nINGER: Your Doctor. His mood is as inconstant as... as...\nTURLOUGH: As the Doctor.

THEY HOWL AND START TO DISSOLVE TO NOTHING.\nKARLINA: No. Even now my life is spared...\nPOSITIVE: SUFFUSION OF LIGHT ENERGY CALMS EVERYTHING.\nKARLINA: A new light. A new world. Skarsgard has done his final service for Isenfel. Now I must do mine.\nSTARTS: TRAMPING THROUGH SNOW.\nKARLINA: I was going to the Edge. I have no reason to change my course.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75: EXT. ICE PLAIN\nINGER: SKINNING SNOWBEAST. TURLOUGH WALKS OVER.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry to interrupt your... whatever it is you’re doing.\nINGER: I am skinning the beast. Then I shall joint it for the feast.\nTURLOUGH: Sorry I asked. Thank you... for a rather more exciting evening than I’d planned. And sorry. About Karlina.\nINGER: (KEEPS WORKING) You will not stay, Sir Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Tempting as it is.. No. You want to remain in your home. And I’m a long way from mine. It’s not even in this universe.\nINGER: (STOPS, PUTS DOWN TOOLS) You are doing your ‘running and hiding’?\nTURLOUGH: Yes.. because, frankly, you terrify me.\nINGER: Come here, Sir Turlough.\nINGER: GRABS AND KISSES HIM.\nTURLOUGH: Well. Not all the time...\nJESPER: (CALLING, OFF) Highness! Princess Inger!\nINGER: My huntsman, Jesper. Where is his steed? Where are his men? — (CALLING) Jesper! What has happened?\nJESPER: (RUNNING UP, BREATHLESS) Sir Turlough! The Lady Tegan, she came with me. We were looking for you.\nTURLOUGH: Me? Tegan went out there, looking for me?\nJESPER: Yes. Yes. I am sorry. The metal carriage took her.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 137\nTURLOUGH: What? What are you talking about? What ‘metal carriage’?\nJESPER: It went back to the stars... I could not save her.\nINGER: He is raving. (SLAPS HIM) Jesper. Recover yourself.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t knock his head off!\nJESPER: My lady. I apologise. Thank you.\nINGER: Good. He has come to his senses.\nTURLOUGH: Start again, Jesper. Slowly. Tell me what’s happened to Tegan!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: EXT. ICE PLAIN, OUTSIDE TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND NYSSA WALK TO TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: I can’t say for certain how long the power will last.\nNYSSA: The transduction dome’s holding the atmosphere in place.\nDOCTOR: Providing artificial night and day. Nothing else. You checked the Balancing Chamber?\nNYSSA: The entire control centre under the palace has gone. Fused into solid ice. No sign of Skarsgard.\nDOCTOR: No. There wouldn’t be.\nDOCTOR: THEY STOP.\nNYSSA: We could take them somewhere more hospitable. It doesn’t have to be such a struggle.\nDOCTOR: (UNLOCKS TARDIS) They want to stay. Life can flourish here with no restrictions. They can do the things they never could before. Change, grow, expand.\nNYSSA: They may not have more than a few generations.\nDOCTOR: They don’t need to know that. They’ve been living long enough under one death sentence. They don’t need another. (BEAT) Now, where are the others?\nNYSSA: Turlough’s with his princess. And Tegan...?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Tegan is.. (BEAT) Where is Tegan?\nNYSSA: She went to the village. I haven’t seen her since.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure she’1ll turn up. To be honest, I’ve been enjoying the peace and quiet.\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 139\nNYSSA: (WORRIED) No. She’d have been back by now. Everyone from the village came back. She... (AGHAST) Oh, where is she?\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING UP) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Turlough! (WORRIED) We seem to have mislaid Tegan. Have you seen her anywhere?\nTURLOUGH: No. But I know what’s happened...\nNYSSA: What is it? Is she-\nTURLOUGH: (OVER HER) She’s been taken! Somebody’s kidnapped Tegan!\nDOCTOR: What?!\nDOCTOR WHO: EQUILIBRIUM (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77: INT. PIRATE SHIP, BRIG\nSMALL: CONFINED PRISON CELL, METAL FLOOR. SHIP’S ENGINES B/G\nTEGAN: BANGS ON METAL DOOR.\nTEGAN: (CALLING) Let me out! (BANGS AGAIN) Won’t someone answer! Who are you people? Where are you taking me?\nTEGAN: HAMMERS ON DOOR.\nTEGAN: Please!\nSTEPS: AWAY AND SINKS TO FLOOR\nTEGAN: (TO SELF) Oh, Doctor... Where are you?
