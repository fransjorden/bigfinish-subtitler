You know: lanes, strikes, weird shoes. Not lawn bowls.\nDOCTOR: Lawn bowls, Ace, is a game of hats, strategy and precision, followed by tea. A noble sport. Wars should be fought on the bowling green.\nACE: But we need to do something!\nDOCTOR: You’re going to have to entertain yourselves, I’m afraid.\nHEX: (APPROACHES FROM OFF, WHISTLING) Where are we off to, then?\nACE: Apparently we’re to occupy ourselves.\nHEX: Why? What’s he up to?\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 3\nDOCTOR: Enhancing the TARDIS, Mister Hex. I’ve been meaning to add this particular feature for a while...

Can’t be that hard.\nHEX: I don’t think you should be messing with the console, Ace.\nACE: (TRIUMPHANT) Here we go. A list of planets in the area: Spindle; Gardeline B; Hair.. (BEAT) Do you reckon Hair is a planet made of hair?\nHEX: Sounds horrible. Like a hawked-up hairball in space.\nACE: Cross-referencing with the Index File... Hey, it says this planet’s just been opened.\nHEX: How do you open a planet?\nACE: It’s called Unity. “The planet that brings you face to face with yourself.”\nDOCTOR: (QUICKLY) Oh no. Sounds terribly boring. Choose another. Any other. (BEAT) I’ve heard Hair’s lovely this time of year.\nACE: You’re hiding something, aren’t you? (DECISIVE) That’s settled, then. We’re going to Unity.\nACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 4\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider?\nHEX: We’re not going anywhere called Hair.

You’1l be going there after this.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nACE: So what are we waiting for now?\nLOGLAN: (WITH REVERENCE) Mrs Wheeler, of course.\nHEX: She the boss, then?\nLOGLAN: The face of Unity, yes. Everyone knows her from the informercials. — Why don’t you...?\nACE: We don’t pay much attention to adverts.\nLOGLAN: She’s a star. People cross galaxies to come here and meet her.\nDOCTOR: All looking for a quick fix for their ids.\nCROWD: Is that her now?/ It’s her!/ Ssh! Ssh!\nWHEELER: (CHARISMATIC, COMMANDING) Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the next stage of your lives.\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 9\nWHEELER: I’m Lindsay Wheeler, CEO of Unity Corporation. I hope you’ve had a chance to walk round the dome and see our famous Unity moths?\nWHEELER: These beautiful creatures are unique to this world. With one dark wing and one light, they’re a symbol for our mission here: two opposing sides coming together, so we can take flight.\nWHEELER: Using a combination of technology and Jungian psychology, we’ve harnessed the potential of this rare psychic planet so that you can reach yours. Within a week, each of you will overcome your shadow self and be reborn.\nWHEELER: Many of you come to this planet with broken wings.\nWHEELER: I was the very first person to benefit from the programme. I\nWHEELER: had broken wings of my own, once, but since stepping into the Shadow Collector, I’ve never been happier or more successful. If you put your trust in the Unity Process, that which holds\nWHEELER: you down shall hold you down no more!\nDOCTOR: (CLEARS HIS THROAT) (CALLING OUT) That all sounds most inspirational — but what, exactly, does this Process entail?\nWHEELER: An excellent question and one I was just about to get to, Mr...?\nDOCTOR: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 10\nWHEELER: As I was saying, the psychic planet manifests your shadow self.\nACE: (CALLING OUT) Your bad side?\nWHEELER: No, although that’s a common misconception. Your shadow self is your buried side, the one you like the least. (BEAT) Here, we can bring out that hidden self — quite literally. All of you will be able to meet your inner selves, in order to resolve the conflicts that rage inside us all.\nWHEELER: After you’ve met your shadow, you’1l be taken to the Unification Pod a mile beneath Unity’s crust. There, thanks to the planet’s psychic power, [you’1ll be re-integrated with...]\nGROVE: Let me through! (CALLING OUT) Mrs Wheeler! Mrs Wheeler! I need to speak to you urgently, and your idiot ‘hosts’ won’t let me through.\nCROWD: Who’s that, making all that fuss?/ What’s going on? [ETC]\nWHEELER: I’m in the middle of a Welcome meeting, Professor Grove. Kindly wait in my office and we can discuss your... issues later.\nGROVE: ‘Issues’? ‘Issues’?! Did you even read my report?\nWHEELER: Or I can ask my hosts to escort you outside. Rowan? Marcus?\nGROVE: Alright, alright! There’s no need for that. I’1ll go. (PARTING SHOT) But I insist that we talk, or I’1ll be taking my concerns to the shareholders!\nCROWD: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page I]\nWHEELER: I’m so sorry about that. I think our Professor Grove may need another turn in the Integration machine!\nWHEELER: Each of you has been assigned a host. They will now take you through to a waiting room. (BEAT) See you on the other side of you.\nCROWD: (MILLING AROUND, EXCITED) This is it!/ So thrilled!/ She’s just like she is in the adverts. [ETC]\nACE: Right then, Loglan. You’re our host. Any chance you could answer the Doctor’s question?\nLOGLAN: Question?\nDOCTOR: About what this ‘process’ entails.\nLOGLAN: I will take you all through to a waiting room, then one-by-one into Professor Grove’s Shadow Collector, which separates out your shadow self and places it inside an android, onto which your own features will have been projected. The rest was explained to you by Mrs Wheeler.\nDOCTOR: Professor Grove... that would be the same Professor Grove who was so perturbed just now?\nLOGLAN: (SERENITY ITSELF) Yes... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Very reassuring.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR: SCENE 5. INT. MRS WHEELER’S OFFICE\nGROVE: (ENTERS) Where is she? I have to speak to her!\nSANDY: (FLUSTERED) I’m sorry, Professor Grove, Mrs Wheeler isn’t back from the Welcome Meeting yet.\nGROVE: Please, Sandy, you don’t have to talk to me like.. like we don’t know each other.\nSANDY: I can alert you when she returns. She has a ten-minute window later this afternoon.\nGROVE: She won’t listen to me. You have to help me get through to her, Sandy.\nSANDY: I can’t help you, you know that. I’m her P.A., nothing more. If she caught us here, talking like this, colluding against her — she'd kill me.\nGROVE: Look at me, Sandy. Me and you — there’s still a connection, I know there is...\nSANDY: No, Malcolm! This is not appropriate. Please. You have to leave.\nGROVE: She’s expecting me to be here. I’m not going anywhere.\nSANDY: Then I will.\nSANDY: THE ROOM. DOOR OPENS.\nGROVE: Sandy! Don’t be like that. Sandy...!\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 13\nGROVE: SCENE 6. INT. WAITING ROOM\nGROVE: IN, FOOTSTEPS DEADENED BY CARPET.\nLOGLAN: Come in. Please be seated.\nACE: Can’t we just get on with it? I hate waiting around.\nLOGLAN: Not just yet. First, could you each take one of these forms, and sign both copies?\nHEX: What are we signing away, exactly?\nLOGLAN: It’s a simple indemnity, so Unity is protected in the unlikely event of... misadventure.\nACE: Like when you go skydiving.\nDOCTOR: But in this case it’s your soul that might end up in pieces.\nLOGLAN: The Shadow Collector is utterly safe. I’ve been through it.\nACE: So you’re all integrated now?\nDOCTOR: I’d say not.\nLOGLAN: Indeed, Doctor. Unity policy states that hosts are to present without their shadows. It was found that we functioned better and were much more content. My shadow self has been externalised and stored in a holding area. When my contract is up, I'll make peace with my shadow and go, as you will later today, to the Unification Pod.\nDOCTOR: (INTRIGUED, AS IF EXAMINING HIM) Don’t you resent them for taking your shadow?\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 14\nLOGLAN: (BLITHELY) Not at all. It’s very freeing. I have no doubts, no anxiety, no fear.\nHEX: And there are no problems? No side effects?\nLOGLAN: None.\nDOCTOR: Ace, Hex — are you sure you want to go through with this? There’s no shame in changing your mind...\nACE: This was my idea and I’m going through with it. — Sign here, right, Loglan?\nLOGLAN: Beside the ‘X’.\nDOCTOR: What about you, Mister Hex?\nHEX: I dunno. Not sure I want to take on my shadow self.\nACE: Come on! Where’s your sense of adventure?\nHEX: (SIGH) Oh alright, give us the pen.\nACE: Yehhh!\nDOCTOR: Well, then: if all your paperwork’s in order... I think I’1l take a walk.\nHEX: You’re not taking part?\nDOCTOR: Not on this occasion, no.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 15\nACE: Maybe you’re scared of what you might find.\nDOCTOR: Maybe what I might find would be scared of me. (BEAT) I’1l see you both later. And both of you too, Mr Hex. (DEPARTS)\nHEX: Hang about, Doctor — you can’t just wander off...!\nLOGLAN: It’s time to take you through to the Shadow Collector. Who wants to go first?\nACE: Me!\nHEX: You’re keen.\nACE: I’m bored. I want something to happen.\nLOGLAN: (TO HEX) Wait here, please, sir. I’1ll return for you presently.\nHEX: (CALLING AFTER) See youse both laters, then...!\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 16\nHEX: SCENE 7: INT. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: Now if I were Mrs Wheeler’s office, where would I be? (STOPS) How about... here?\nPOSH WOMAN: (SHOCKED) Excuse me!\nDOCTOR: Please, don’t get up, madam! I’m the Doctor. Delighted to make your acquaintance. I don’t suppose you could tell me [where]\nPOSH WOMAN: The doctor, thank goodness. Please, would you take a look at this bite on my arm? It’s all yellow, and it seems to be spreading —\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, I don’t have any appointments free for the next ten thousand years.\nPOSH WOMAN: What?\nDOCTOR: Fully booked, I’m afraid. Now: you wouldn’t happen to know where I might find Mrs Wheeler’s office, would you...?\nPOSH WOMAN: Second floor, other side of the Dome. But —\nDOCTOR: Thank you, madam. You’ve been most helpful. Er, about that bite...\nPOSH WOMAN: Yes?\nDOCTOR: You should get it seen to, it looks nasty.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8. INT. SHADOW COLLECTING ROOM\nDOCTOR: THROBBING HUM FROM MACHINE. HIGH CHIME SOUNDS.\nLOGLAN: The Shadow Collector is ready. You can go inside now, Ace.\nACE: “The Shadow Collector”. Sounds like a fairytale villain. Not sure I want to lose my shadow to a fairytale villain.\nLOGLAN: It’s just a name.\nACE: This is real, right? Cos it sounds like magic, not science.\nLOGLAN: Science involves enquiry, and the methodical examination of replicable physical results. Professor Grove has found a way to integrate people quickly, again and again. He’s proven Jung’s theories, without months or years of painful psychoanalysis.\nACE: Guess most things sound like magic till they happen every day, then they’re just normal. — So, what, I just walk through into\nACE: this booth?\nLOGLAN: Enter the Collection chamber and lie on the bed. I’11 be able to see you from the control room next door. When you’re secure, I will begin the Process.\nACE: Let’s do it. (BEAT) Here goes nothing.\nACE: Cramped. — Loglan! Can you see me from there?\nLOGLAN: (D) Perfectly, now just lie down.\nACE: Alright —\nACE: AROUND HER LIMBS.\nACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 18\nACE: What the — It’s clamped me! I can’t move!\nLOGLAN: (D) The restraints are for your own protection.\nACE: No, wait, I’m not [sure —]\nLOGLAN: (D; OVER NOISE) Don’t worry, you’ll be in the recovery room just a few minutes’ time.\nLOGLAN: in\nLOGLAN: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 19\nLOGLAN: SCENE 9. INT. MRS WHEELER’S OFFICE\nGROVE: There you are, at last!\nWHEELER: Professor Grove. I hope my assistant made you an appointment. — Where is that wretched girl...?\nGROVE: Never mind her, Lindsay. It’s you I came to see.\nWHEELER: (SIGH; SITS AT DESK) Make it quick, Malcolm, I have only the briefest window. (SLIGHT ITCHING ON HAND) Ahh...!\nGROVE: Yes, well — you said we’d be reducing numbers, not increasing them. This is the third intake today. The planet can’t replace its psychic core quickly enough to meet demand. (INTIMACY HINTED AT) Lindsay — this isn’t what we set out to do.\nWHEELER: LE 2Sn tt?\nGROVE: We set out to help people feel as good about themselves as we did when we first arrived. — Don’t you remember that, Lindsay?\nGROVE: How things used to be?\nWHEELER: We used to be broke.\nGROVE: I meant —\nWHEELER: I know what you meant. — Actually: I’m glad you’re here, Malcolm. I’m thinking of introducing an express service. Bypassing the middle stage, that’s what takes so long.\nGROVE: You can’t expedite the process of self-knowledge!\nWHEELER: But you have! You, Malcolm, have made a fly-through for the soul!\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 20\nWHEELER: SCENE 10. INT. RECOVERY ROOM\nACE: (WOOZY AND SHAKY) Nice place to recover, Loglan. Your interior decorator really likes white.\nLOGLAN: How are you feeling?\nACE: Like I’ve been sent flying after an explosion.\nLOGLAN: Not anxious at all?\nACE: (WITH EFFORT AS SHE TRIES TO STAND) Bit wobbly. Like after giving blood. You got a biscuit?\nLOGLAN: Why do you want a biscuit?\nACE: That’s what you get where I come from, after giving blood.\nLOGLAN: Why would you give blood?\nACE: To help people, dummy. You know, in hospital.\nLOGLAN: (PUZZLED) Don’t they have synthetic plasma, where you come\nLOGLAN: from?\nACE: Doesn’t matter. I could still use a Custard Cream, though.\nLOGLAN: Pulse normal. Temperature normal. No chemical imbalances.\nACE: I could’ve told you that.\nLOGLAN: Good. Well, then — I’d better go to your friend, Mr Hex.\nLOGLAN: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 2]\nACE: Wait, you’re just going to leave me on my own?\nLOGLAN: You won’t be alone.\nLOGLAN: Ace — meet your shadow self.\nSHADOW ACE: (ENTERING) (COLD) Wotcha.. ‘Ace’.\nACE: Oh my G—\nSHADOW ACE: It’s just me and me now. What will we find to talk about?\nSHADOW ACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL)\nSHADOW ACE: SCENE 11: INT. MRS WHEELER’S OFFICE\nGROVE: Did you feel that?\nWHEELER: Feel what, Malcolm? (ITCHING SKIN) Ah...!\nGROVE: The ground shook. That was an earth tremor!\nWHEELER: We’ve had them before.\nGROVE: The planet’s hurting. It’s warning us, Lindsay!\nGROVE: Page\nGROVE: 22\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 23\nGROVE: SCENE 12: INT. RECOVERY ROOM\nACE: (TO SHADOW ACE) I can’t get my head round this. Are you what I look like? Cos normally when I look in the mirror, I only see my mirror face, know what I mean, the one you put on to see yourself. (BEAT) Course you know what I mean. You’re me. Or are you? This is so confusing.\nSHADOW ACE: Well, aren’t you chatty?\nACE: What do you want to do now? We could go exploring, off round the island, anywhere you like.\nSHADOW ACE: I don’t want to go anywhere with you.\nACE: Come on, we have to do something.\nSHADOW ACE: No, you have to do something. It’s what you always do — run around, blow things up, make all that noise to stop yourself from hearing me.\nACE: That’s ridiculous.\nSHADOW ACE: Is it?\nACE: (DISCOMFORT) Remind me never to get my shadow removed again. I’d rather go to the dentist’s.\nSHADOW ACE: No you wouldn’t. You’re scared of dentists.\nACE: I’m not scared of anything.\nSHADOW ACE: Yeah, right.\nSHADOW ACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 24\nSHADOW ACE: SCENE 13: INT. MRS WHEELER’S OFFICE\nGROVE: Please, Lindsay — at least hold off any more groups while I reconfigure the machine.\nWHEELER: We can’t. I have responsibilities to our shareholders. And to our guests, of course.\nGROVE: What about the planet?\nWHEELER: Planets don’t sign contracts — (ITCHING) Ahh!\nGROVE: Why do you keep doing that?\nWHEELER: What?\nGROVE: Scratching your arm.\nWHEELER: Just a slight skin irritation.\nGROVE: Show me.\nWHEELER: (PULLING UP SLEEVE) It’s infuriating. I hope that girl remembered to book me into dermatology.\nGROVE: (REACTS) That’s an insect bite. Looks sore. [It might be infected. ]\nWHEELER: There’s that girl, at last. (FX: MONITOR INTO LIFE. DISTANT ALARM IN BACKGROUND OF SCREEN) Sandy! Did you remember my appointment?\nSANDY: (D; OVER MONITOR) No, I — got distracted.\nWHEELER: For the last time, girl, when I tell you to do [something]\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 25\nSANDY: (D) Mrs Wheeler, please! I’m in the security section. There’s an alert.\nWHEELER: What is it?\nSANDY: (D) One of the Shadow Hosts has escaped from the holding bay.\nWHEELER: How? !\nSANDY: (D) There was an earth tremor. The locks cut out for a moment.\nWHEELER: Where is he now?\nSANDY: (D) He ran out into the corridors. He could be anywhere.\nGROVE: Lindsay — you need to sound a general alarm.\nWHEELER: No! We will not cause panic. The Shadow shall be isolated, and the host removed from the planet.\nGROVE: But we won’t be able to reunite host and shadow.\nWHEELER: Too bad. — Meet me in the Control Room, Sandy. We’1ll track his progress from there.\nSANDY: (D) Yes, Mrs Wheeler.\nGROVE: I told you this would happen if we continued to place the planet under stress. It’s having an effect on everything. We’re not meant to be kept from our shadows for that long. (BEAT) You know what it’s done to you. Before that we were fine, [but after —]\nWHEELER: Before that I was weak... like you. Out of my way, Malcolm.\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 26\nGROVE: Lindsay, please!\nWHEELER: I’m going now. But I need to make sure you can’t cause any further disruption.\nWHEELER: WITH AN ELECTRONIC BEEP.\nGROVE: Lindsay? (REALISATION) She’s sealed me in! — Lindsay!!!\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 27\nGROVE: SCENE 14: INT. RECOVERY ROOM\nACE: How about we go and find the Professor? Bet he can’t wait to meet you.\nSHADOW ACE: Every time we go off with him, we almost get killed. Not for me, thanks.\nACE: We can’t just stand around here doing nothing! You’re much less fun than I thought.\nSHADOW ACE: You mean I don’t want to put us in danger all the time? Is that what you mean by fun?\nACE: Yes! (ASIDE) No wonder I don’t want people to see this side of me.\nSHADOW ACE: You were the one who wanted to drag me out.\nACE: I’m beginning to wish I hadn’t.\nSHADOW ACE: You can’t wish me away now. You can’t click your heels and have me slink back into the dark.\nACE: Yes, I can. That’s what the other machine is for. We’re going to resolve our issues then be popped back together.\nSHADOW ACE: What if I don’t want to be unified with you?\nACE: What do you mean? Hey, come back!\nSHADOW ACE: You’1l have to catch me first. (FX: SHADOW ACE ACTIVATES DOOR) See how easy it is to catch a shadow.\nACE: (GRABBING SHADOW) No, wait...!\nACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 28\nSHADOW ACE: Leave... me.. alone!!! (SHOVES ACE)\nACE: (REELING) Ahh! — Where are you going? Come back here!\nSHADOW ACE: Not on our life.\nSHADOW ACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 29\nSHADOW ACE: SCENE 15. INT. MRS WHEELER’S OFFICE\nGROVE: Someone help me, please! — I need to get out!\nDOCTOR: Professor Grove, I presume?\nGROVE: How did you do that? Mrs Wheeler has the only key.\nDOCTOR: You can do a lot with an umbrella, a safety pin and an optimistic outlook.\nGROVE: Who are you? What do you want?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, and I want to know exactly what it is you’ve done to this planet.\nGROVE: This planet has helped to me heal tens of thousands of people each year.\nDOCTOR: (ANGER RISING) And before then? What was the planet doing before you got your hands on it?\nGROVE: Well, it —\nDOCTOR: I’1ll tell you, shall I? Because I’ve been here before, when this planet had its own name: Umbra. When the ancient Umbrians walked its lands and went to the woods with their shadows. Where are they now, the Umbrians? Where are the people who understood this world?\nGROVE: We encouraged them to take up residence on one of the nearby moon colonies.\nDOCTOR: You encouraged them?\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 30\nGROVE: There were.. financial inducements...\nDOCTOR: And so this planet was sold into slavery.\nGROVE: I admit we’ve gone too far with the mining. But you can’t enslave a planet...!\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure Umbra agrees with you.\nWHEELER: Maybe so. (BEAT) I’m beginning to think that it doesn’t agree with what we’ve done at all.\nDOCTOR: Meaning?\nWHEELER: Meaning that the planet is cracking under the pressure. Literally.\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 31\nWHEELER: SCENE 17. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM\nWHEELER: SHADOW LOGLAN TRIES TO DESTROY UNITY PROPERTY. MRS W RUNS UP.\nWHEELER: Sandy! Where’s Loglan’s shadow now?\nSANDY: That’s him in the control room, Mrs Wheeler. Smashing the place\nSANDY: up.\nWHEELER: Malcolm should’ve anticipated this: the more devoted the employee, the more angry and resentful the shadow. (CALLING OUT) Loglan! Shadow Loglan! Come out of there right now!\nSHADOW LOGLAN: (AT WINDOW) Mrs Wheeler! Our esteemed overseer! How can I help you today? Need something fetched? Carried? Shadowed?\nWHEELER: What do you hope to achieve, with this wanton destruction?\nSHADOW LOGLAN: We’ve been repressed for too long. I’m going to let the shadows out of the holding bay!\nWHEELER: (CALLING) Security!\nSHADOW LOGLAN: You can’t hurt me. If you hurt me, other Loglan loses me!\nSANDY: He’s right, Mrs Wheeler.\nWHEELER: Security — destroy that shadow.\nWHEELER: GUARDS x 2: Ma’am.\nWHEELER: I don’t want to hear it, Sandy.\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 32\nSHADOW LOGLAN: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 33\nSHADOW LOGLAN: SCENE 18. INT. CORRIDOR\nGROVE: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: That’s the ultimate question. Right now, we’re going to shut down this facility before the planet fractures.\nWHEELER: (OVER TANNOY) (STEELY YET PLEASANT) All guests are to return to their rooms immediately. I repeat, all guests are to return to their rooms immediately.\nGROVE: Something’s happened. She’d never order a lockdown unless something bad had happened.\nDOCTOR: No, I doubt that she would.\nGROVE: The control room. Hurry!\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 34\nGROVE: SCENE 18. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RECOVERY ROOM\nACE: (CALLS OUT) Here, Shadow, Shadow! — Where are you? (STOPS; TO SELF) How are you supposed to call your own shadow anyway?\nHEX: (WEAKLY) Ace? That you?\nACE: Hex! — You don’t look so good.\nHEX: I feel like all my bones have been taken out.\nACE: What happened?\nHEX: Met my shadow. Then he decked me, and ran off. What was yours like?\nACE: Awful. No fun at all.\nACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 35\nACE: SCENE 19. INT. CONTROL ROOM\nLOGLAN: (ARRIVING) Mrs Wheeler? I got your message — (REALISATION) What happened here?\nWHEELER: Your shadow happened, Loglan. Tell me: what was it made you want to do this?\nLOGLAN: But I didn’t!\nWHEELER: Part of you did. I’m disappointed. Sandy — Loglan will be leaving Unity. Make sure he’s on the next flight out.\nSANDY: I — Yes, Mrs Wheeler.\nGROVE: (TAKING IN SCENE) Oh, no...!\nWHEELER: Malcolm?! I thought I locked you in...!\nDOCTOR: Not everything can be locked away as securely as we’d like, Mrs Wheeler.\nWHEELER: You again! Who are you? What do you want here...?\nDOCTOR: Your employees’ shadow selves, for instance. Penned in, in the dark of a holding area, for months on end. No wonder they feel resentful.\nWHEELER: They’1ll be re-integrated, in time.\nSANDY: Loglan won’t.\nLOGLAN: What?\nLOGLAN: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 36\nSANDY: She destroyed your shadow self, Loglan. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: How many people do you employ here on Unity, Mrs Wheeler?\nWHEELER: I have nothing to say to you.\nSANDY: Close to a hundred.\nWHEELER: Sandy...! I’m warning you...!\nDOCTOR: And have all of them had their shadow selves extracted?\nWHEELER: All except the security staff, yes.\nGROVE: (REACTING TO MONITORS) Oh my goodness.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was wondering when one of you would notice.\nWHEELER: Notice what?\nDOCTOR: The closed circuit television feed from the holding bay. That is the holding bay, on the third screen along?\nWHEELER: What on Earth are you talking about—\nDOCTOR: Now, where’s the audio switch..? — A-ha!\nDOCTOR: MONITORS.\nSHADOW HEX: (D) Out you come! All of you!\nSHADOW ACE: (D) You’re free! Free!\nSHADOW ACE: 10 OR MORE SHADOWS: (D) Free! Free! Free!!!\nSHADOW ACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K.

And all our heads are on the block!\nDOCTOR: 10 OR MORE SHADOWS: (D) Free! Free! Free!!!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 38"

Start to put the pieces back together.\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Staff Nurse Schofield! — Professor Grove: there’s a direct link between the Unification Pod and the planet’s psychic core — correct?\nGROVE: It’s in a lava pool, a mile underground. Sometimes you hear sounds there, like voices.\nACE: So how do we get to it?\nGROVE: We built a shuttle. It runs along a fault line, to the pool.\nACE: Right then. Let’s go give this planet some therapy.\nSANDY: But the guests! We have to get them safe!\nHEX: The lady’s got a point.\nSANDY: It’s Sandy.\nHEX: Sandy’s got a point.

Closer than a shadow.\nACE: AUTOMATICALLY.\nGROVE: Mind the doors. And strap yourselves in.

So, what, we get back down to the beach, direct people this-a-way?\nSANDY: It’s not secure, though.\nHEX: That’s wots-her-face, Mrs Wheeler! Hey — you don’t think she’s abandoning everyone here?\nSANDY: I know her, Mr Hex.\nHEX: Alright, but she can’t fly that thing alone! — Can she?\nSANDY: She doesn’t need to. It’s got an automatic pilot.\nHEX: She’d really just leave everyone to die?\nSANDY: It wouldn’t bother her. She jettisoned empathy with her shadow.

I did warn you.\nACE: Great. Did this pod thing have to be so far underground?\nGROVE: I needed to access the faultline to tap psychic energy direct from the planet’s psychic core. It drains here, into the Anthropos Mechanism, then gets diverted up to the Shadow Collector.\nACE: When you said ‘pod’, I'd imagined something small. Not the\nACE: inside of a huge glass sphere, looking out over a sea of lava.\nGROVE: It is quite spectacular, I admit.\nACE: It’s amazing. How did you build all this, even?\nGROVE: Well...\nDOCTOR: Yes, Professor Grove. Do tell.\nGROVE: Well, we had very advanced excavation machinery.\nDOCTOR: And?\nGROVE: And universe-class engineers.\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR: And labour? What about labour, Professor Grove?\nGROVE: (MISERABLY) Many of the Umbrians worked on the excavation programme, as part of the resettlement deal.\nACE: So, wait a minute, are you saying that you got the people of this planet to build you all this — then cleared them all out?\nDOCTOR: I expect they were cheap.\nACE: That’s sheer exploitation!\nGROVE: (QUIETLY) I know.\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K.

We know what you were up to.\nSANDY: Come back with us to the complex. We need to evacuate everyone that we can.\nWHEELER: Well, look at you — all commanding now. Maybe I taught you something after all. (BEAT) Why should I help anyone?\nSANDY: Because it’s all your fault. And because they’1ll listen to you. You’re a celebrity.\nHEX: Whoa! That jet’s never going to take off unless we get a move on!\nWHEELER: Exactly. There’s no time! One chance, Sandy. Come with me, or die. Your choice. I’m indifferent either way.\nWHEELER: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 52\nSANDY: We could have done great things together, you and me. But you only ever wanted to your shadow for a dogsbody.\nHEX: Wait, what? Sandy - you’re her shadow?\nSANDY: Of course I am!\nHEX: But you don’t look or sound anything alike.\nWHEELER: I’m in the transformation business. I transformed.\nSANDY: I have the face and voice and name she used to have, before the fractal facial reconstruction, and the voice reshaping. I’m everything she didn’t like about herself. Everything she wanted buried.\nWHEELER: And it’s cheered me up no end, Sandy dear, to look at you every hour of every day, and see how improved I am.\nSANDY: That’s all I am to you. The ‘before’ picture in the makeover.\nWHEELER: Well, yes. I don’t need you. (BEAT) Now get out of my way.\nHEX: Careful!\nSANDY: Goodbye, Hex. Tell Malcolm — Professor Grove — tell him I’m sorry.\nWHEELER: Never mind him. Come on, girl!\nHEX: You’re not going with her?!\nSANDY: No. But I won’t let her leave without me.

There goes our only way off of this planet!\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 54\nHEX: SCENE 28. INT. POD OVER LAVA\nDOCTOR: So this is the Anthropos Mechanism?\nGROVE: Well, that’s the capsule. Climb inside, and you’re connected to the mill that grips the core of the planet, exposing you to the maximum psychic energy, knitting shadow and self together again.\nDOCTOR: But now the core itself needs to be re-integrated.\nGROVE: Exactly. I’m thinking — if we can reprogram the Mechanism with a model for wholeness, we can feed it back down into the planet’s core, so it can heal itself.\nDOCTOR: An excellent plan. — Right then. Stand aside, Professor Grove.\nACE: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to reprogram the Anthropos Mechanism.\nACE: With what? You haven’t got any tools.\nDOCTOR: With me! There’s no-one better integrated than me. I’1l be the model for wholeness.\nACE: Yeah, but the planet’s gone barmy! It might do anything to you!\nDOCTOR: If it doesn’t work, most likely my psyche will be shattered into a trillion pieces. But then, so will this planet. So what difference does it make?\nACE: Well, when you put it like that...\nDOCTOR: Look after my umbrella, would you, Ace? — Now then. (STEPS INTO MECHANISM)\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 55\nIT FIRING UP: LIKE THE SHADOW COLLECTOR, BUT AMPLIFIED MANY TIMES OVER.\nACE: What’s happening?

Benedict (FINAL) Page 56\nACE: SCENE 29. EXT. BEACH\nHEX: (CALLING OUT) You lot! Stop running around like headless chickens. The waves are gonna swamp this place! You need to get to higher ground! — For goodness’ sake, listen, will you?!\nSHADOW ACE: Hex, mate — chill out, will you?\nHEX: (TURNING) Ace? — No, you’re not Ace. You’re her shadow.\nSHADOW HEX: She’s right, though. If they can’t save themselves, they’re not worth saving.\nHEX: Oh, it’s you. I owe you a sock on the jaw. Only it’s, what? Plastic? Metal?\nSHADOW HEX: Metal, with a holo-graphene layer for a face. Go on, have a go. I dare you.\nSHADOW ACE: Leave it, mate — (COLLOQUIAL) ‘He’s not worth it’.\nSHADOW ACE: SHADOW HEX & ACE:\nHEX: Right pair of comedians you are. Just leave us alone, will you? I’m trying to do something useful.\nSHADOW ACE: (PULLING UP METAPHORICAL HANDBAG) Ooooh! Hear that, Shadow Hex? He’s doing something useful.\nHEX: It might not be much, but at least I’m not just stood around sniping from the shadows!\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 57\nSHADOW HEX: What about the Doctor, and other Ace? Shouldn’t they be your first priority ?\nSHADOW ACE: Good point, Shadow Hex!\nHEX: They’re alright. They’ve gone off to some underground lava pool, with Professor Grove.\nSHADOW ACE: You what?\nHEX: They’re gonna fix all this. I hope. They’re taking their time, mind you.\nSHADOW ACE: But the planet’s breaking up! That’s just suicide!\nHEX: So go and do something about it! See if they need any help! I mean, do you want her to die?\nSHADOW HEX: Or do you want to be reunited with her, so you can carry on snarking while she carries you around?\nSHADOW ACE: Hey, I never said you could have a pop at me!\nHEX: Look, you two do what you like. But if you’re gonna do anything, go and see if the Doctor and Ace are OK, will you?\nSHADOW HEX: He’s got a point, Shadow Ace.\nSHADOW ACE: Reckon. Alright, then. (DEPARTING) See ya, Hex.\nSHADOW HEX: (DEPARTING) Wouldn’t want to be ya!\nHEX: Come on, you lot! The mountains are this-a-way!\nCROSSFADE TO: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K.

I think he might be —\nACE: He can’t die, that’s not how it works. Just open the door, will you?\nGROVE: It only opens from the inside. A safety feature.\nACE: Pretty useless safety feature!\nACE: Doctor! Are you...?\nACE: WITH A CLANG.\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) Yes, Ace? You knocked?\nACE: (RELIEF) You’re okay!\nDOCTOR: Just about. I think one of my hearts stopped for a while there. But I appear to have exploded the Anthropos Mechanism.\nACE: I thought I was the one who was supposed to blow things up. (BEAT) Alright, what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: Professor, any ideas?\nGROVE: None at all. And there’s no way back to the surface!\nDOCTOR: Then it seems I’m in my favourite place.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 59\nGROVE: Where’s that?\nDOCTOR: Backed into a corner.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: SCENE 31. INT. SHUTTLE ROOM\nSHADOW HEX: Ace? (FX: STATIC) Can you hear us down there? (FX: STATIC) You try, Shadow Ace.\nSHADOW ACE: Ace? Oi, cloth-ears! Can you hear me??\nSHADOW HEX: Ahh, leave it. Chances are they’re dead already.\nSHADOW ACE: But I’d know, wouldn’t I?\nHEX: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Are you two trying to get in touch with the Doctor?\nSHADOW HEX: Done with being a hero, are you?\nHEX: Got a line of hosts leading people up into the mountains. Even their shadows seem to have come to their senses. Guess divided selves still have a survival instinct. — What’s going on here, then?\nSHADOW ACE: Stupid comms aren’t working.\nHEX: You tried thumping the console?\nSHADOW ACE: What good will that do, Shadow Hex?\nSHADOW HEX: Ace would thump the console. The other Ace. Not you.\nSHADOW ACE: Why?\nSHADOW HEX: Because she’s stubborn. Pig-headed. Never gives up. (QUIETLY, FULL OF UNSAID EMOTION) I’d miss her, if she died.\nSHADOW HEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 61\nSHADOW ACE: Aww, Shadow Hex. What about me, would you miss me?\nSHADOW HEX: I’d miss both of you, like you’d miss both of me.\nSHADOW ACE: I guess.\nHEX: So let’s get her. For all of us. (FX: HE THUMPS CONSOLE, HARD. STATIC CLEARS) Ace? Doctor? Can you hear me?\nHEX: AND CRACKLY.\nACE: (D) I’d ask “Hex, is that you?” but of course it is, who else could reach me a mile underground in a lava lake?!\nHEX: You need to come back, now. Both of you.\nACE: (D) We can’t.\nSHADOW ACE: Just come back, will you?\nACE: (D) Hang on, is that—?\nSHADOW ACE: Yes, it’s you! Me! Look, the earthquakes are getting worse. The last place we wanna be is underground.\nACE: (D) No, I mean we can’t. The shuttle’s fritzed. There’s no way [back. ]\nSHADOW ACE: There must be something we can do.\nSHADOW HEX: Get you, being all pro-active! What do you call the shadow side of a shadow self?\nSHADOW HEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 62\nACE: (D) [Get out and save yourselves. While you can. ]\nSHADOW HEX: I can’t hear her. (BEAT) Hit it again!\nSHADOW HEX: Ace?\nSHADOW ACE: ACE!\nHEX: (QUIETLY) She’s gone.\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 63\nCROSS DIRECTLY TO: SCENE 32: INT. POD OVER LAVA [CONTINUOUS]\nACE: (DISTRAUGHT) They’ve gone. Looks like we’re on our own, Professors.\nDOCTOR: No-one’s ever really on their own, Ace. Even when there’s no-\nDOCTOR: one else in the room.\nACE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: There are times when we should be glad of our shadows. — Now, where did you put my umbrella..? (SPOTS IT) Ah, there!\nGROVE: What do you need that for...?\nDOCTOR: Three lives to save, Professor. Three wishes.\nDOCTOR: One. (TAP) Two. (TAP) Three. (TAP)\nACE: What the...?\nACE: Hang about — you’re —\nSHADOW DOCTOR: I’m the Doctor.\nACE: But he’s -\nDOCTOR: Here.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 64\nGROVE: There’s two of him!\nDOCTOR: Meet my shadow self.\nSHADOW DOCTOR: I think you’ll find, you’re my shadow self.\nDOCTOR: He’s very argumentative.\nSHADOW DOCTOR: I am not!\nDOCTOR: That’s me, alright. (ALOUD) Umbra? Planet Umbra? Are you listening? Are you watching, even?\nACE: I think the planet heard you...!\nDOCTOR: Of course the planet heard me. This is the cave where the ancient Umbrians came, to commune with the psychic core.\nACE: What?!\nDOCTOR: As you can see, Umbra, I can summon my shadow self at will.\nDOCTOR: My shadow self is here, dear Umbra, to show you how well we get on.\nDOCTOR: The humans who came to you took your power and turned it into money. You welcomed them and they betrayed you.\nDOCTOR: They took away your means of expression, they used up your energy and then mined you for more. They did not deserve what you gave them, Umbra!\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: But neither do they deserve to die.\nDOCTOR: We'll make them leave, Umbra. Destroy the mechanisms that strangle you. What do you say?\nDOCTOR: Still not sure, eh? Well, Shadow Doctor — can we please show Umbra how much greater we can be when we join forces?\nSHADOW DOCTOR: An excellent idea, Doctor! But how?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps — through the medium of dance? A-one, two, a-one-two- three —\nDOCTOR: BALL-CHANGE OR TWO WITH A TAPPING FLOURISH TO FINISH.\nACE: Can we keep the Shadow Doctor? He’s fun.\nDOCTOR: And for the big finale... we merge into one.\nSHADOW DOCTOR: (WALKS FORWARD) Here goes —\nACE: (CRESTFALLEN) Wait, where’s he gone?\nGROVE: He just walked into you and disappeared!\nDOCTOR: He’s where he always is: inside me, until I choose otherwise. An integrated personality makes use of all aspects available. Sometimes you need the you that’11l do what you won’t.\nACE: Like the weather people! Not the ones on telly, the ones where the man comes out with the umbrella when it’s raining, then, when it’s sunny, the smiley one takes his place.\nACE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: Exactly, Ace. — So what do you think, Umbra? Will you trust me? Both of me?\nGROVE: It still doesn’t sound sure.\nGROVE: THE TARDIS.\nACE: There’s a moth in the TARDIS, Doctor. It’s in the window.\nDOCTOR: Probably attracted to the light out here. (BEAT) Let it out, Ace.\nDOCTOR: FLIES OUT.\nACE: Whoa! Where’s it gone?\nGROVE: Doctor, don’t move! It’s on your hat.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING OUT) See? It likes me. They all like me, which means you like me too. Because we’re old friends, Umbra. Don’t you remember? How I sat with my shadow under your palm trees centuries ago...?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I looked different then. I’ve had seven selves so far, Umbra; and with luck, more will follow. Accepting all your selves is what being a Time Lord is all about.\nDOCTOR: You too can heal the fractures inside yourself, Umbra, and be at peace again. But you need to re-integrate those humans split\nDOCTOR: from their shadows, too.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: Yes, and then Unity Corps will leave this planet — won’t it, Professor?\nGROVE: (CALLING OUT) Of course.\nDOCTOR: (TO UMBRA) So what do you say?\nDOCTOR: LINES IN AGREEMENT.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Umbra. From me and my shadow.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: SCENE 33: EXT. BEACH\nDOCTOR: BEAT, THEN THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. DOOR OPENS. ACE, PROF. GROVE AND THE DOCTOR WALK OUT .\nDOCTOR: It seems to be working.\nACE: Even so. This place isn’t what it was.\nDOCTOR: Give it time and it will be again.\nACE: I’m going to find Hex, make sure he’s alright.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be too long, we’ll be leaving soon.\nACE: (HINT OF SHADOW ACE) You’re always telling us what to do.\nDOCTOR: (WORRIED) Ace, I —\nACE: Just messing with you, Professor!\nGROVE: Wh-what just happened? I don’t... I can’t...\nDOCTOR: Don’t be hard on yourself, Professor Grove. The TARDIS baffles the best of them. Jung himself had to have a lie-down on my chaise longue.\nGROVE: Jung was... in there?\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nGROVE: But how...?\nDOCTOR: He helped me with a problem involving the Cyradi, a species that invades dreams.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 69\nGROVE: But... when?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. Last month? Next year? Last me? (BEAT) Hard to hold onto these things sometimes, isn’t it?\nGROVE: I don’t understand a tenth of what you’re saying, Doctor, but it has been a privilege to meet you.\nDOCTOR: (STERN WARNING) I’11l be checking up on you. I’m placing you personally responsible for overseeing the closing-down of Unity and the return of Umbra’s original inhabitants.\nGROVE: (CHASTENED) Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nACE: Found him!\nDOCTOR: (FONDLY) So I see.\nHEX: Got no idea what just happened. The shadow usses — their faces just disappeared, they’re just plastic people with blank heads now.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the shadows have gone.\nACE: Umbra’s re-integrated everyone, right?\nHEX: Just like that?\nACE: Just like that.\nGROVE: Mister — Hex, is it? Sandy — Mrs Wheeler’s assistant? She was with you...\nGROVE: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 70\nHEX: Sorry, mate. She’s gone. Her and Mrs Wheeler both. They were each other, you know.\nGROVE: I know. I loved them both, once.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s time that we were going. Goodbye, Professor Grove.\nDOCTOR: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: SCENE 34. INT. TARDIS — CONSOLE ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: BUTTONS.\nHEX: I’1l never be able to look at my shadow in the same way again.\nDOCTOR: Nor should you. You never quite know what they’re up to.\nACE: You do know I know, don’t you, Professor?\nDOCTOR: Know what, Ace?\nACE: The Shadow Doctor was a trick, right? What I don’t know is how it was done.\nDOCTOR: Plan A was to use the Anthropos Mechanism to map my mind onto Umbra’s. Plan B was to summon up a projection from the TARDIS’s telepathic circuits. A little psychological chicanery to change the mind of the psychic planet.\nACE: I get it. It wasn’t him you were leading a dance. It was Umbra!\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Therapy is a pas de deux, after all.\nACE: But you couldn’t have known we’d be meeting Umbra! Not before we landed — (REALISATION) Hang about: that was what you were\nACE: working on, wasn’t it? Under the console?\nDOCTOR: I’d heard nasty rumours about Unity. It was on my list of things to investigate.\nHEX: The list on the destination monitor, yeah?\nACE: What?\nHEX: It’s simple, Ace. He’s had us. Again.\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: Where to now? Hair, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: ACE and HEX: (TOGETHER) No!\nDOCTOR: I’‘1ll choose then, shall I?\nDOCTOR: IT’S THE END OF PLAY, THEN: A SUDDEN, SICKENING LURCH!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/ ACE/ HEX: Whoa!!!\nACE: (WINDED) Nice take-off, Doctor.\nHEX: (WINDED) Yeah, you forget to take the gearstick off or something?\nDOCTOR: Don’t be absurd —\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/ ACE/ HEX: Whoa!!!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/ ACE/ HEX: Waaah!\nHEX: (CATCHING BREATH) Is this gonna keep happening? Only I don’t think my guts can take it!\nACE: Lightweight!\nACE: DOCTOR/ ACE/ HEX: Ahhhh!\nACE: (RECOVERING) Actually... you may have a point.\nHEX: What’s causing it? Doctor?\nHEX: #226A: SHADOW PLANET by A.K. Benedict (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: (AT CONTROLS) Something’s trying to materialise in the Vortex. Something colossal.

(MUSING) No obvious signs of animal life. No birds in the sky. No vegetable matter...\nHEX: (SUDDENLY EXCITED) So are we the first people ever to see this then, do you reckon?\nDOCTOR: It’s possible. This planet’s not supposed to be here, after all...\nHEX: Wow! Just... wow.\nACE: What’s that over there? Looks like a coral reef.\nACE: (FX: FOLLOW DOCTOR & ACE AS THEY WALK A FEW STEPS — IE, AWAY FROM HEX. )\nDOCTOR: Some kind of natural structure, certainly. (TO HIMSELF) Interesting! Oh yes, this is all very interesting...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR POTTERS ABOUT, IMPROVISES, PICKING UP INTERESTING ROCKS AND JAMMING THEM IN HIS POCKETS. )\nDOCTOR: (MUTTERING) Now, then, erm.. you’ll do. And how about you? (BLOWS FROST AWAY) Oooh, you’re a pretty thing, aren’t you? Yes, you are! Why don’t you come with me...?\nACE: (HE’S LOST IT) Er... Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know... just collecting a few small rock samples to take back to the TARDIS.\nACE: Nicking them, you mean?\nACE: Page 8 of 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: I am not “nicking them”! This is legitimate research. (RESUMES PICKING UP ROCKS)\nACE: Yeah yeah, whatever! — I’m going back to Hex.\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Yes, yes, you do that. (PICKS ANOTHER ROCK) Now I like you very much...\nCROSS TO: Page 9 of 75\nCROSS TO: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 10\nCROSS TO: SCENE 5. EXT. BEACH.\nCROSS TO: (FX: CLOSER TO THE SHORE. WAVES GENTLY LAPPING. ACE APPROACHES. )\nACE: (STRIDING UP) How you getting on then? (BEAT, CLOSER) Hex?\nHEX: (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) What? Yeah, sorry. I was just...\nACE: Distracted by something?\nHEX: (SHEEPISH) Kinda, yeah.\nACE: Looks like it’s contagious. The Doctor’s off studying rocks. He’s back there cramming loads of them into his pockets. “Legitimate research”, he calls it!\nHEX: We'd have got told off for doing that kinda thing back at school. It was always “put things back where you found them... be sure to tidy up after yourselves...”\nACE: “You must hold hands at all times!”\nHEX: (TRYING HIS LUCK) Whatever you say, miss!\nACE: (TEASING) Watch it!\nHEX: (SIGHS, TAKING IT IN) Be honest though. It is a bit breathtaking, isn’t it?\nACE: Ten minutes ago we were on a beach with palm trees. Don’t think I’1ll ever get used to it. Not sure I’d want to either.\nHEX: Yeah. (BEAT) Do you ever think he gets used to it? The Doctor?\nACE: Erm... (LOOKS ROUND) Not if his reaction to all those pebbles and shells is anything to go by.\nACE: Page 10 of\nACE: 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page I]\nHEX: (LAUGHS IT OFF) Gotcha.\nHEX: It never gets boring, does it?\nACE: What doesn’t?\nHEX: The sea. It’s like a kaleidoscope, drawing you in. (MORE ANIMATED) And here, look! The waves are these sheets of ice that keep crashing together and changing shape. It’s kind of hypnotic...\nACE: (WATCHING) Oh yeah, I see what you mean! Ha...\nHEX: (BEAT, MUSING) It’s funny. My Nan’d take me to the seaside every summer when I was a kid, and the sea would make me feel so small... I think it was something about the horizon... I'd look out across this vast expanse of water, as all the waves came crashing in from somewhere else... and I realised that it wasn’t the end! (BEAT) The world didn’t just stop where the sun went down - it carried on I didn’t know how far! And that made me feel really... insignificant.\nACE: And now?\nHEX: Now...2 Now, I look out across the sea, I watch the waves, and I get that very same feeling! Nothing’s changed. I know it carries on, that there’s more to the world. It still makes me feel small. (BEAT) The difference is: now it excites me.\nACE: That’ll be the Doctor’s influence. Because it’s not just the rest of the world beyond the horizon: it’s the rest of the universe! And you know what, if feeling small’s the price you have to pay for a sunset on an alien planet, I think I can live with that...\nHEX: (WITH A SMILE) Me too. (DEEP BREATH) It’s peaceful here though, isn’t it? And I mean, really peaceful.\nHEX: Page 11 of 75\nHEX: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 12\nACE: No one else around, the Doctor said. Just us.\nHEX: (BEAT) We could go for a stroll down the beach. Do a bit of exploring...\nDOCTOR: (FROM NOWHERE) An excellent idea, Mr Hex!\nHEX: (FLUSTERED) Doctor?! Where did you come from?!\nDOCTOR: Just over there. Remember?\nHEX: Yeah. Course. ObviouslLy...\nHEX: (FX: UNDER THIS, THE FAINTEST SOUND ON THE WIND.

Can you hear that?\nACE: Hear what?\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHING IT OFF) Oh, it doesn’t matter. Probably just this old\nDOCTOR: mind of mine playing tricks!\nWHISPER: Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Funny. It sounded familiar somehow...\nHEX: (CATCHING SIGHT OF SOMETHING) Hang about! What’s that out there?\nACE: What’s what out where?\nACE: Page 12 of 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 13\nHEX: Just over there, between those two large shards of ice... See?\nACE: (SCANNING) Erm... nope. Sorry! What am I looking for exactly?\nHEX: Dunno. Looks like it has arms, or fins, or something...\nDOCTOR: Maybe not just my mind playing tricks...?\nHEX: Yeah. Well, whatever it was, it seems to have gone now...\nACE: If there even was anything in the first place! I mean, who’d be out in weather like this? (SHIVERS) It’s Baltic out here.\nDOCTOR: Remind me to take you to Darvillia Minor sometime. That’1l answer your question.\nACE: Great. Can’t wait. (BRUSHES OFF THE COLD, TEASING) Got all your rocks then?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes! (FX: SHAKES POCKETS; ROCKS CLATTER) More than enough to be getting on with. (CHANGING SUBJECT) But I was thinking, you know, while we’re here - and as you’d already mentioned it...?\nACE: (PROMPTING) Go on...\nDOCTOR: That a stroll along that outcrop might be interesting? There looks to be quite an intricate system of caverns — just there, see?\nACE: (OVERLAP) Oh, er...\nHEX: (OVERLAP) Right, yeah okay. You see, the thing is, [Ace and I were planning] -\nHEX: Page 13 of 75\nHEX: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: (IGNORING THEM) I mean, it isn’t every day that a planet appears from nowhere. It seems a shame not to take a proper look around. (BEAT, LEADING) Unless you have something more pressing to pass the time?\nHEX: Well, now that you mention it -\nACE: (RELENTING) Oh, alright, go on then! Shame I didn’t bring my climbing gear with me. You up for it, Hex?\nHEX: (SULK) Er, actually... Mind if I, er.. (CLEARS THROAT) Mind if I sit this one out?\nDOCTOR: Something the matter, Mr Hex?\nHEX: Nah, course not! It’s just.. I’ve always rather liked being at the seaside... even the weird, pink-frosty alien ones.\nACE: You sure...?\nHEX: Yeah! I know it’s not Skeggy, but I love it out here. (CHIVVYING) You two go and have fun. I’11 catch up with you later!\nDOCTOR: Splendid! Come along then, Ace! Let’s leave Mister Hex to his thoughts...\nACE: Promise we won’t be long. (FX: RUNS OFF) Oh, and stay out of\nACE: trouble!\nHEX: (CALLS) Will do!

It’s like you don’t even know me!\nACE: Where are we heading anyway?\nDOCTOR: (POINTING) Just up there.\nACE: (SEARCHING) Erm...\nDOCTOR: Above that crag! There appears to be some kind of opening. Might be a cave. I do so love a cave! All we have to do (GRUNTS AS HE GETS FOOTING) is a little bit of climbing!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR STARTS SCRAMBLING UP THE CLIFF FACE. EFFORT TO INDICATE. )\nACE: You sure this is safe?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Absolutely! (GRUNTS AS HE NEGOTIATES THE TERRAIN) The structure’s not made of rock. It’s more like some kind of\nDOCTOR: sponge. Which makes it incredibly easy to - (GRUNTS AS HE MOVES) - to find a purchase!\nACE: If you say so!\nACE: Urgh, that’s really weird!\nACE: Page 15 of\nACE: 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: Weird, but strangely practical.\nACE: Yeah, I guess.

Yes.\nACE: Not that it could get much colder. Some kind of geothermal heating then, I’m guessing?\nDOCTOR: Possibly...

(BEAT) Wait. Are you saying that isn’t natural?\nDOCTOR: Oh no, it’s completely natural. These tunnels would have been cultivated over millennia. Grown and then... refined, perhaps?\nACE: Refined?\nDOCTOR: By previous civilisations, Ace! Keep up. (BEAT, A FEW MORE STEPS) It’s not getting darker either, which can only mean -\nACE: (LEAPING IN) Some kind of low-level natural phosphorescence?\nDOCTOR: (PROUD) Very good. (DISTRACTED BY THE ROCK) Now, then... Let’s see how this compares to those samples I took...\nDOCTOR: Interesting... the samples from the beach seem to be considerably\nDOCTOR: younger than the rock face here!\nACE: (WARY, LOW) Er, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not now, Ace.

Unless she’s doing what I’m doing?\nHEX: Oh, you’re overthinking this! Just think: what would Damo say? He'd have said... (SIGHS) He’d have said: you know what, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, so why worry about the small stuff? Someone else will always be there to pick up the pieces.

(GRIM) What’s left of him...\nACE: He looks human. Well.. as human as anyone can do under the circumstances.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Which is curious, as I don’t recall any human colonists making it out this far during this time period.

They’re not. (STUDYING THEM, MAKING DEDUCTIONS) Different uniforms too. So not all from the same party. And yet, they’ve all huddled together. Why is that? (SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE) Oh, hello. What’s this?\nDOCTOR: Hmmm. Some kind of primitive data recorder.\nACE: Primitive?!\nDOCTOR: I consider anything where you have to press “play” and “record” at the same time primitive...

The more modern synthetics also appear to be the most decayed. Now what does that tell you?\nACE: That they don’t make things like they used to, even in the future?\nDOCTOR: There’s some kind of temporal discrepancy here. Like the rock!\nACE: Oh yeah...

RECORDED MESSAGE.\nACE: We didn’t go far to begin with. We wanted to stay close by in case the Doctor returned, not that he has yet. We found more caves like this one, dotted along the shoreline, so we set up makeshift shelters, never straying far from where we started. You know, just in case he came and couldn’t find us. (DARK THOUGHT) Maybe he has already...?\nACE: (DISMISSING) No. No. If he’d found a way to get here, he wouldn’t leave without us. Because the Doctor isn’t like that. He finds a way. Just like we have to find one now...\nHEX: (OFF, CALLING) Ace, you decent?\nACE: (FLUSTERED, TO HERSELF) Don’t give up.

(LONGER BEAT) Still waiting... (SIGHS) How long do I have to - (GASPS) Did that just move?\nHEX: Uhuh. Yup. Figured an alien rock pool might have alien crabs. Spotted a few more like him over there. This fella’s the biggest so far though!\nACE: Great, so you’ve found a pet!\nHEX: No. I’ve found us food.\nACE: Food? We can’t just - [eat that]\nHEX: We have to eat something! We’re running low on protein packs. And yeah, alright, that seaweed stuff’s fine for now - [but]\nACE: Oh, Hex, it’s rank!\nHEX: Yeah, you’re right, it is. So this.. this is another option!\nACE: (UNSURE) I guess. (BEAT) Do you even know how to cook a crab?!\nHEX: Don’t even know how to catch one yet.

Better than the seaweed anyway. And so, yeah, after four or five days, we got into a sort of routine.

I’m using her telepathic circuits to make contact.\nACE: Like the Shadow Doctor, sort of! Only this time, you’re just in my head — right?\nDOCTOR: The principle is similar. The practice is rather more complicated.\nACE: Because of what this planet is?\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t adhere to the conventional laws of physics. (BEAT) Time passes differently where you are. (STRAINING) Making it that much harder to communicate...\nDOCTOR: I got the idea from that voice we heard on the wind. I thought it sounded familiar. (BEAT) Then it struck me. It was me from the future. Me, now, talking to the past. Because Nirvana loops through time...\nACE: Right. And when you say it passes differently here: is that why it feels like ages since we last saw you?\nDOCTOR: (SOFT, BITTERSWEET) Oh, Ace, you have no idea...\nACE: Doctor, for once, just tell me! Please!\nDOCTOR: Calm down, Ace. (BEAT, BACK TO NORMAL) Ace...? Please, you have\nDOCTOR: to listen to me.\nACE: What just happened?!\nDOCTOR: The psychic link is fragile.

Perhaps even decades?\nACE: (STUNNED) What..? But it only feels like - [a week]\nDOCTOR: (OVERLAPPING) Decades for me, Ace.\nDOCTOR: I haven’t left the TARDIS. Not since it left Nirvana.

Don’t make this harder than it already is...\nDOCTOR: I just wanted to let you know we’re trying...\nACE: Yeah. And what are we meant to do in the meantime?\nDOCTOR: Look out for one another.

We have to do something!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I don’t have all the answers, Ace... not this time.\nACE: But what are we meant to do?\nDOCTOR: Just keep on moving...\nACE: Then how will you find us?!\nACE: Page 59 of 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: I can’t be sure.

(DEEP BREATH, STEADIES HERSELF) Hex, I saw the Doctor.\nHEX: What? Where?!\nACE: Not here. When I was dreaming...\nHEX: Oh, Ace...\nACE: I know it sounds mad.\nHEX: You can say that again.\nACE: But it was him, Hex. He spoke to me!

INT. SHELTER. RECORDED MESSAGE.\nACE: We began a new journey the following morning. I figured that, after my dream, the Doctor would find us somehow. And it didn’t make sense to stay in one place too long... We’ve looped around the island too many times. We’re exhausting its resources. Stay here, and we’ll starve, or freeze... or both.\nACE: We’ve already spotted signs of land on the horizon. It’s clearest in the morning, before the mist falls after dawn. (BEAT) Obviously, we’ve no idea what might be out there. Knowing our luck, probably nothing. But there might be something - perhaps even someone - that can help us?\nACE: The ocean itself is frozen solid. Or at least, solid enough to take our weight.

(LOOKS ROUND) Well, we seem about halfway, so another couple of days?\nHEX: Hey, this was your idea!\nACE: I know.\nHEX: And it’s a great idea.\nHEX: Like you say, quick break, and we’1ll be on our way in no time!\nACE: Maybe not that quick. (BEAT) You got any more of those protein packs?\nHEX: Ran out yesterday evening... Still, plenty of seaweed if you\nHEX: fancy some?\nACE: Ugh.

(BEAT) Look...\nHEX: I heard something banging against the surface about ten minutes ago.. (EFFORT) And if I just... scrape away.. the top layer... (STOPS) There! See...?\nACE: (SQUINTING) What the hell is that?\nHEX: No idea. Still not clear enough to make out properly. But it’s like some kind of swarm, I think.\nACE: (DREAD) I’m getting a really nasty sense of déja vu.\nHEX: Oh?\nACE: Yeah. Saw something just like them in a dream I had. Well, a nightmare.\nHEX: And would that be the same dream where the Doctor promised to rescue us?\nACE: I’m serious, Hex. (FREAKED) They looked just like those things. And in the dream... (SIGHS) well, let’s just say it didn’t exactly have a happy ending.\nACE: Page 66 of\nACE: 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 67\nHEX: Yeah? Well, they’ve been massing down there for the last half hour or so. I went for a walk, and they followed me. I saw their shadows moving through the ice.

(GENTLER, TO DOCTOR) How long did you end up waiting? In the end.\nDOCTOR: Too long, by the looks of things... (GENTLE) I’m sorry, Ace.\nACE: I know.\nDOCTOR: It took the TARDIS the best part of an age to track you down. (BEAT) Those samples I took: they’re unique. Only one planet in the universe like it. Unfortunately it’s located outside normal space...\nHEX: That’s why it took so long for you to find us...?\nDOCTOR: In a sense... (EXCITED BY THE SCIENCE) The more I studied the samples, the more I realised. Nirvana is a living, breathing organism! The planet’s alive!\nACE: What, like Umbra?\nACE: Page 72 of\nACE: 75\nACE: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: Even more remarkable than that! Its appearances in normal space would seem to be part of an elaborate feeding cycle, luring wayward travellers onto its shores! Oh, I’ve never seen anything like it, Ace! I doubt I will again...\nHEX: Count yourself lucky.\nDOCTOR: Oh, luck has nothing to do with it. Like I said: the TARDIS couldn’t go back there. Not without shorting out the time differential.\nHEX: Meaning...?\nDOCTOR: Meaning: they’d have cancelled each other out! It’d have become fixed in space and time...\nACE: So we’d have been trapped there...?\nDOCTOR: “We”? (REALISING) No no no, Ace! I’m not talking about the TARDIS. I mean the planet!\nACE: (FLAT) What?!\nDOCTOR: Nirvana is a complicated event in space-time. So is the TARDIS. (BEAT) Oh, I know she looks like a daft old wooden box, but the powers contained in here could blow a hole in the universe. The two could never co-exist in multiple time zones...\nHEX: And in English?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) If I were to have landed the TARDIS on Nirvana again, it would have been brought back into normal space, and stranded at a single point in time.\nHEX: So?\nHEX: Page 73 of 75\nHEX: #226B: WORLD APART by Scott Handcock (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: So it would have never been able to move - or hunt - again. It would simply have perished... (BEAT) That’s why it took me so long to come back for you. I couldn’t run the risk of killing Nirvana...\nHEX: (FUMING) I don’t believe I’m hearing this! We almost died down there, on that planet... a planet that’s now free to carry what it’s doing - hunting through space and feasting on innocent people - all because you didn’t want to rescue us?!\nDOCTOR: Of course, I wanted to rescue you!\nACE: (ANGRY) Why didn’t you then?! Why did it take so long...?!\nDOCTOR: I’ve already told you!\nHEX: Yeah. Because you didn’t want to land and kill the wretched planet...

(SIGHS, GENTLER) I’1ll see you later, yeah?\nDOCTOR: I’1l be here whenever you’re ready.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS, WEIGHT OF THE WORLD) They’1l come round eventually. I hope.
