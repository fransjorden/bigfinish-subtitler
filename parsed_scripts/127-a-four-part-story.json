(ALOUD) Now — I realise my cart is somewhat unorthodox, but I assure you it’s all the rage in the Levant.\nHUBERT: Is that so?\nDOCTOR: I wonder, sire — by your finery — you wouldn’t be Hubert, Earl of Mummerset, by any chance?\nHUBERT: I would. Fear not, Doctor, we Normans can easily tell a knight from a demon. Unlike this Saxon rabble!\nHUBERT: YOKEL 1: Who’re you calling a rabble?\nHUBERT: Quiet! (TO DOCTOR) I know why you’re here, Sir Doctor. And I wish you all the best, in your mission.\nNYSSA: Mission?\nHUBERT: Why, to rid my castle of its demons.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure I believe in demons, sire.\nHUBERT: Neither did the fellow before you.

But one never knows, does one?\nDOCTOR: What hundred acres?\nHUBERT: You men, let them through! They’re next!\nNYSSA: Doctor, I don’t like the sound of this.\nDOCTOR: My lord, I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else.\nHUBERT: Don’t tell me you’ve got cold feet already? Are you so hungry for the burning badge of cowardice?\nHUBERT: (FX: OSBERT HAS BEEN FISHED OUT AGAIN AND IS BEING DRAGGED UNWILLINGLY AWAY )\nHUBERT: YOKEL 1: (FAR OFF) The smithy’s this way, Osbert Mud-Stealer!\nOSBERT: (FAR OFF) Please!

I daresay the Earl will have got some sort of posse together by now.\nOSBERT: Yurr. With pitchforks and that.\nDOCTOR: Quite. So I strongly suggest we put a little more distance between ourselves and the village, before we even begin to think of heading back.\nNYSSA: (TO OSBERT) How much further is it to the river?\nOSBERT: Mile or two east, I’d say.\nDOCTOR: Excellent idea, Nyssa!

Tell me that.\nDOCTOR: As a means of preventing besiegement, I should imagine. Every well appointed castle should have its own secret passageway.\nMAUD: (CACKLING) Wrong, fool! Besiegement my ears! Old Earl used it to smuggle village strumpets in and out of the castle, under the nose of his wife — that’s why it was built.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Yes. Still...\nMAUD: Maud the Withered weren’t always withered, you know. Used to be as pretty a trollop as there was, in me day. Afore the pox caught us, yurr!\nDOCTOR: Does the young Earl know about this passage?\nMAUD: Didn’t have no interest in strumpets when he departed Stockbridge. Too young he was. Sold into the Lionheart’s army, poor lamb.\nDOCTOR: The old Earl sold his son?\nMAUD: Good as. He was a wrong ‘un, alright, the Old Earl.

Great hellish fireball came, shooting over the battlements. That night, the old Earl wuz found dead in his bathtub. Then was the lightning, and the terrible sounds of demons about their infernal business. The servants fled. Soon after, all the fish died in the River Stock.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) What’s that noise?\nMAUD: Castle waterwheel, that’s all. (WALKS ON)\nDOCTOR: Why would demons keep the waterwheel turning?\nMAUD: S’pose demons has to wash, same as the rest of us. (FX: FADING INTO DISTANCE) Come — onward, Sir Doctor! Onward to your dooooom! (CACKLES)\nMAUD: SCENE 21: EXT. CASTLE GATE\nNYSSA: Corrupt? I don’t understand, Sir Roland?\nROLAND: (RANTING) Is it any wonder, my Lady, that demons gather in such a place? A place of bribery and corruption, where demonic infestation may only be rooted out by auction!\nHUBERT: Well, I wouldn’t put it quite that way myself.\nROLAND: Luckily, sire, we are true and noble knights. Paladins, successors to the Peers of the Emperor Charlemagne himself!\nSMITHY: Oh, he’s that Roland of Brittany.\nHUBERT: You’ve heard of him, Smithy?\nSMITHY: Yurr.

My comrades likewise — Samson, Engelier and Ganelon!\nSMITHY: Cor!\nHUBERT: What’re you fawning over him for? I thought he killed Jasper!\nSMITHY: Yurr, but that’s afore I knew he was famous.\nNYSSA: (PIPING UP) Well then, Sir Roland, hadn’t you and your knights better get on your heroic quest?\nROLAND: We shall, Nyssa of Traken, we shall. But first, Lord Hubert, there is the matter of our expenses.\nHUBERT: E-expenses?\nROLAND: Saddlery. Armoury. Weaponry. General administrative costs. It all adds up — does it not, my knights?\nNYSSA: (CYNICAL) Oh yes. Adds up to what?\nROLAND: Four thousand gold pieces.\nHUBERT: I don’t have that!\nROLAND: What, you flinch at the cost of ridding your castle of demons?\nHUBERT: I-it’s not that.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 58\nROLAND: Ah, but perhaps we have got it wrong. Perhaps a man could only suffer such a visitation if he was possessed by demons himself! Perhaps we should begin, sire, by purging you?\nHUBERT: M-me?\nROLAND: By fire. Is the best way. (CALLING OFF) Samson, fetch brushwood! Engelier, Ganelon — build a stakes!\nHUBERT: No, no — wait. I do not have coffers, sir Knight. But I may yet extract an added tithe from my peasantry.\nSMITHY: Not another tithe!\nHUBERT: Shut up, serf. (TO ROLAND) Say — four hundred gold pieces a year, payable over ten years?\nROLAND: (SNIFFS) Five hundred over the same period. That is acceptable.\nROLAND: 3 x KNIGHTS:\nHUBERT: Five hundred? But you said —\nNYSSA: It’s called ‘interest’, sire. It’s very modern.\nHUBERT: Very well. The castle gate’s that way.\nROLAND: Well then — move!\nHUBERT: Oh no, you’re the experts.

I just came back for my branding, that’s all!\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) What are you playing at, Lord Hubert?\nHUBERT: (SOTTO) The more bodies in the Castle, my ‘Lady’, the less chance I have of falling victim to the demons.

(BEAT) There. Am I right, or am I right?\nRUTAN: Quiet! Alien: you will tell us all you know about Sontaran activity in this sector!

Now — will you drop that sword?\nROLAND: (FX: CLATTER OF SWORD) (DEFENSIVE) I — I drop my weapon only so I might not succumb to more of this ‘eel-eck-tricks’!\nNYSSA: Very wise. Might I suggest you remove your armour, too?\nROLAND: What, I must face this demon naked now?\nNYSSA: No, just not wearing anything metal.\nROLAND: Then I will be safe?\nNYSSA: Safer than the Knights who’ve faced this force before. Remember all those brave men in the courtyard — your own men, too — they were dressed head to foot in steel. The only one who’s faced these creatures and survived was a peasant in rags. Which reminds me: where is Osbert?\nROLAND: Fled, along with the noble Earl of Mummerset.\nNYSSA: Let’s hope neither of them saw fit to use Hubert’s sword on the soldiers. Anyway, we’ll think about Osbert and Hubert later. Right now, our priority is you. So strip! (BEAT) Well?

In the passage?\nHUBERT: (OFF) Sir Doctor? Is that you?\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Hubert, Earl of Mummerset. (ALOUD) It is indeed me, Sire. (FX: FLEXES STRAPS) I wonder whether I might prevail upon you to come in here and release me?\nHUBERT: (FX: WALKING THROUGH INTO DUNGEON) Have you seen? Sir Doctor — just outside this door there is a dead peasant!\nDOCTOR: Maud the Withered, I know. I’m afraid she met your demon.\nHUBERT: Maud the Withered. Dead! Do you know — (CONFIDENTIALLY) — they say she’d lived all of thirty-nine summers!\nDOCTOR: I suppose middle age counts as a good innings, in the Middle Ages. But she deserved a more peaceful end, poor woman. (HE COUGHS MEANINGFULLY) My Lord Hubert? (FX: FLEXES STRAPS) The straps?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD\nNYSSA: I’m right, aren’t I, Roland? Your quest is for money?\nROLAND: (REMOVING BITS OF ARMOUR) What if it is, my Lady? There are no noble quests, not any more. In Palestine, the finest families of Europe gather to butcher the heathen, and be butchered by him in turn. Tell me — where is the honour in a Crusade overseas, when the Western lands are left unguarded from the dragons of want, and disease?\nNYSSA: Well — fight those dragons, then. By your measure, isn’t it better to die battling dragons, than live for hire?\nROLAND: (IS SHE MAD?) A Knight must live in a manner befitting his status. Not like some — (FX: DROPS ARMOUR) .. peasant.\nNYSSA: (SNARKY) Well, I’d rather be a peasant than a mercenary.\nROLAND: (REALLY PISSED OFF) What is this, Nyssa of Traken — you claim to be holier than I? You — a Lady in britches, who speaks freely of ‘druidisation’.\nNYSSA: ‘Androidisation’.\nROLAND: Eel-eck-tricks, and short-circuits — pah! (FX: SNATCHES UP SWORD) (MENACING) How came you by this knowledge, my Lady? For it stinks of witchery to me!\nNYSSA: I told you, Roland of Brittany. Waving your sword around will do you no good. (STIFLING A LAUGH) Particularly when all you’re wearing are long-johns.\nROLAND: These are moleskin underhose!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 83\nNYSSA: And very fetching they are, too. Now. There’s power running through this portcullis, that’s what short-circuited the Turkish Knights. Are you going to help me locate the source or are you going to wave your sword around like a six-year-old boy?\nROLAND: Why should I help you?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, WALKING UP) Because if our Rutan friend repairs it, the Turkish Knights will return from the dead. And then we’1ll be in trouble — won’t we, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (DELIGHTED) Doctor! I thought you were still in the boar trap!\nDOCTOR: Nevertheless, it seems you’ve got along without me very well.\nROLAND: This is — what? Another peasant?\nHUBERT: (WALKING UP) This is Sir Doctor! A noble knight. The only knight, in fact, to have survived an encounter with this demon!\nROLAND: Knight? Knight! What sort of knight it is that wears a vegetable upon his breast?\nNYSSA: So says the angry Frenchman in moleskin underhose.\nDOCTOR: Which rather proves the point, first impressions are never the best. (TO ROLAND) Hello. I’m the Doctor. And you are?\nROLAND: Roland of Brittany. (SARCASTIC) Sire.\nDOCTOR: As in The Song of Roland? Direct in line from the Roland who made his final stand at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass?\nHUBERT: Apparently. (INDICATING BODIES) These were his friends, Samson, Engelier and [Ganelon —]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) No. No, I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 84\nROLAND: Whaaaaaaaaat?!?\nDOCTOR: It’s rather like announcing oneself by saying ‘I am Arthur, King of the Britons — and here are my friends Lancelot, Gawain and Sir Galahad.’ Not only staggeringly unlikely, but historically your very existence is — well, shall we say, debateable?\nROLAND: You may debate it with my heftiest mace!\nNYSSA: (TO ROLAND) So you’re a mercenary, after all.\nDOCTOR: I daresay naming oneself after the bravest paladin of the Emperor Charlemagne is very good for business. (MOLLIFYING ROLAND) But I don’t doubt your abilities, not in the least.\nROLAND: I am so glad to hear it!\nHUBERT: Roland of Brittany? Roland of Berkhamsted more like, or Barsetshire or... or... Bedford ov...\nNYSSA: Wherever he comes, at least he didn’t run away at the first Sign of danger.\nHUBERT: Ah, well... I... I...\nNYSSA: 3: Now. Doctor. ‘Our Rutan friend’?\nDOCTOR: Rutan, yes. A highly intelligent, highly aggressive species from the planet Ruta Three. The one here seems to be engaged in a scientific research project.\nNYSSA: Cloning.\nDOCTOR: Very good. Specifically, cloning itself after having adopted human form.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 85\nNYSSA: We saw it shape-shift, yes.\nDOCTOR: Rutans aren’t natural chameleons. ‘Sham-eleons’, if you like. It’s a technique they’ve developed.\nNYSSA: And it requires significant reserves of electrical energy?\nDOCTOR: Rutans need an electrical field to live, full stop.\nNYSSA: And they’d get that — where, in the twelfth century?\nDOCTOR: It’s been here at least nine months, its vessel’s own reserves must have been exhausted long ago.\nNYSSA: Which means it must be generating the power naturally. Solar cells?\nDOCTOR: Too foggy. Same goes for wind turbines.\nNYSSA: 3: What then?\nDOCTOR: (INSPIRED) The waterwheel! Hubert, Earl of Mummerset — where’s the waterwheel?\nHUBERT: Water what?\nDOCTOR: Maud the Withered described to me a waterwheel — still turning, despite the demon’s presence. She and I heard it from inside the secret passage.\nHUBERT: Passage?\nDOCTOR: From Wells Wood. No? No.\nNYSSA: So what you’re saying is - the waterwheel is generating the electrical field surrounding the castle?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR: It’s a reasonable supposition.\nNYSSA: And if we sabotage the wheel —\nDOCTOR: The Rutan will be powerless. Literally.\nNYSSA: Then all we have to do is follow the moat, and stick something in the wheel?\nROLAND: (FX: RUMMAGING THROUGH FALLEN KNIGHTS’ LANCES) Something like — Samson’s lance?\nDOCTOR: Excellent, Roland! That’d put a spanner in the works.\nNYSSA: Here, let me have it. (HEFTING LANCE) I’ll go. You stay here, help the Doctor contain the Rutan.\nDOCTOR: Right. Yes. Perhaps — Hubert, would you go with the Lady Nyssa?\nHUBERT: I told you, I don’t know where this ‘waterwheel’ is. The old Earl must have had it installed after I departed.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t mean to show her the way. I meant, to protect her.\nHUBERT: M-me?\nNYSSA: I don’t need protecting, Doctor. I’1l be fine!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I hope so, Nyssa. (BEAT) Now then. The High Keep: that’s where the Rutan has its base. I daresay it’s a stupid question, Hubert, but have you noticed any changes to its structure?\nROLAND: (BUTTING IN) I have a question.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR: If you must.\nROLAND: You say this demon may take any shape it chooses?\nDOCTOR: In principle, yes.\nROLAND: Then — might not you be the demon?\nDOCTOR: Me?\nROLAND: You were out of the Lady Nyssa’s sight long enough to be taken by 2.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes, well, you’1ll just have to take it on trust.\nHUBERT: He’s not wrong, though. Sir Doctor. How do we know you are not this demon in disguise? For all we know, you killed Maud the Withered yourself.\nROLAND: How do I know you are not the demon, either? Hubert, so-called Earl of Mummerset?\nHUBERT: How dare you! That title has been [handed down through]-\nROLAND: On your knees! Both of you! Hands on your heads!\nDOCTOR: Good sir knight, this is foolishness!\nROLAND: (FX: SCRAPING SWORD) On your knees, or I shall cut off your feet!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: EXT.

Is that you?\nOSBERT: Aye, ‘tis I. Who is there?\nNYSSA: (FX: CLATTERING DOWN LAST FEW STEPS) The Lady Nyssa. Not a demon.\nOSBERT: The Lady Nyssa...\nNYSSA: . of Traken. Osbert, I wish you hadn’t run away.\nOSBERT: I — ran away?\nNYSSA: Poor Osbert. You’re in shock, I think. Not that it’s my field. How’s your lance-throwing?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD\nROLAND: Prove to me you are who you say you are! Or I shall slay you where you stand.\nDOCTOR: Kneel. We’re kneeling.\nROLAND: Silence!\nHUBERT: Noble Roland, please — it’s not me. I’m no demonic double. This Sir Doctor, mind — he claimed to be a Knight Errant.\nDOCTOR: I did nothing of the sort!\nHUBERT: Ooh, you fibber!\nDOCTOR: You chose to make a series of assumptions. Admittedly, some of those I chose not to contradict.\nROLAND: (SUSPICIOUS) Ah! Economical with the actualité, eh?\nDOCTOR: No, no — it’s not like that!\nHUBERT: Your Lady Nyssa claimed to be your page.\nROLAND: But she was not.\nHUBERT: Yes, and he said he’d fought alongside Sir Justin of Wells.\nDOCTOR: Well, then, ‘Hubert, Earl of Mummerset’ — describe to me Sir Justin!\nHUBERT: EY...\nDOCTOR: You said you knew him too! ‘Mighty Sir Justin’!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 90\nHUBERT: Only by, er, reputation.\nROLAND: I know Sir Justin of Wells.\nROLAND: DOCTOR/HUBERT: (TOGETHER) You do?\nROLAND: (MODESTLY) We fought together, once. That fierce Norseman, built like Atlantic granite. His great red beard, flowing —\nHUBERT: (GABBLING) .. great, big, bristling beard! Red like fire! Yes!\nDOCTOR: Actually, Sir Justin was rather slight in build, and pale of complexion.\nROLAND: Yes, and with a chin as smooth as ivory!\nHUBERT: Ah.\nROLAND: So if there is anyone here who is not all he says he is — it is you, ‘Hubert, Earl of Mummerset’!\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — it’s not only Rutans who take on the guise of the dead. Everyone’s at it — aren’t they, ‘Roland of Brittany’?\nROLAND: (WARNING) Have a care, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What I mean to say is: whoever this Hubert really is, he cannot be a Rutan double, [because—]\nHUBERT: What do you mean, ‘Whoever this Hubert really is’?\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re not the heir to Stockbridge Castle, are you?\nHUBERT: Am so!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 9]\nDOCTOR: Oh, please! You know nothing of its internal topography, despite having ‘grown up’ here.\nHUBERT: I’ve explained that.\nDOCTOR: Not satisfactorily. And as for that mighty weapon of yours...\nHUBERT: Volund’s Spear!\nDOCTOR: . would a Crusader Knight really wield a broadsword one-handed?\nROLAND: It is! It is him! He is a demon! He will DIE!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. WATERWHEEL\nOSBERT: Lance-throwing? My — lady?\nNYSSA: Never you mind, Osbert. I promise you, the demon will be gone soon enough.\nOSBERT: They — will?\nNYSSA: Yes — (HEFTING LANCE; EFFORT) — if I can just jam up the mechanism with this, the Rutans’ electrical field will be cut dead, and then...\nOSBERT: So will they.\nNYSSA: Exactly. (AIMING LANCE) I’ve got to get this just right.\nOSBERT: (FX: SLIGHT CRACKLE) Your scientific understanding is exceptional for the epoch, Nyssa of Traken.\nNYSSA: (OBLIVIOUS, CONCENTRATING) Flatterer.

I’m not the Earl of Mummerset!\nHUBERT: But I’m not a demon neither.\nROLAND: Who... are... you?!?\nHUBERT: A-apprentice apothecary!\nROLAND: A-ha!!! A herbalist’s boy!\nHUBERT: I wuz there, though — in the Holy Land, with the Lionheart!\nDOCTOR: And the real Earl Hubert, I presume?\nHUBERT: Yes, yes. Him too. The real Earl Hubert — he suffered a terrible wound to his head, fightin’ the heathen.\nROLAND: What sort of wound?\nHUBERT: Well, when I was shown to him, his face was all sort of hanging off. The Lionheart’s men, they said I wuz to cure him by the end of the week, else they’d clip off my nose!\nROLAND: This is fair enough.\nHUBERT: Well, there wasn’t nothin’ I could do for him! When he died, I thought — well, why don’t I put on his helmet, take his sword...\nDOCTOR: . steal his identity?\nHUBERT: No, that wasn’t it! All I wanted was for the Earl to be seen walking about for a day or two. Make out I’d cured him, yeah? Then I was going to ‘disappear’ him in the desert, like he’d been captured by Saracens.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR: (OBVIOUS REALLY) Only — in the desert, you got captured by Saracens.\nHUBERT: Seven years in jail, I spent! Seven years in a cell with Yavuz! My, how he snored! Then they told us the Old Earl was dead, and Yavuz — well, he pledged himself to me, he did; promised to break us out if I’d make him my bondsman, in my English estate. Would you know it, one day he succeeded.\nDOCTOR: And you felt obliged to make good on your promise?\nHUBERT: Terrible temper they’ve got, these Levantine types. He’d’ve carved me into kebab pieces if he’d’ve ever learned the truth.\nROLAND: And, er, speaking of your Turkish Knight...\nHUBERT: What about him?\nDOCTOR: Behind you.\nDOCTOR: YAVUZ 4/5/6/7: Circuit restored.

But you don’t need it now, not with the energy lattice.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, what on Earth is going on?\nNYSSA: Return to your ship, Drone Leader. You don’t have much time.\nNYSSA: OSBERT/RUTAN: (FX: BOBBING AWAY) Yes, Nyssa of Traken. We shall. The Rutan Empire salutes you! (EXITS)\nNYSSA: (BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF) It’s alright, he’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. Please don’t tell me you just gave the Rutans a highly sophisticated kinetic conversion unit —\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 113\nNYSSA: . in exchange for your safety, yes. Their own energy lattice was damaged, and it’d take too long to grow another vessel, so they'd been forced to improvise a hopelessly inadequate solution —\nDOCTOR: . if only to maintain the sham-eleonic properties of their Spacecraft, which is mapped over the precise external dimensions of —\nNYSSA: . the High Keep. That’s why it’s the only part of the castle —\nDOCTOR: . not covered in moss. (INNOCENTLY) Carry on.\nNYSSA: Well. I observed that if the Rutans simply altered the shape of their existing energy field, they’d be able to reach out far enough to save my ‘underling’ from Roland of Brittany.\nDOCTOR: And the underling’s grateful, believe me, but -\nNYSSA: I meant no disrespect. Obviously, they’d never have agreed to the deal if they’d thought you were the clever one.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes — but with their power unlimited, they’1l be able to establish a fully-functioning clone factory. On Earth, in the Middle Ages!\nNYSSA: That is their objective, yes.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, what have you done?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: EXT. BESIDE MOAT\nSMITHY: (RUNNING UP) My Lord! Them Turkish Knights has all fallen down in the mud!\nHUBERT: The waterwheel. Of course!\nSMITHY: Soon as the wheel stopped, so did they. Like the fight’d gone right out of ‘em!\nHUBERT: (SOFT) Then Roland of Brittany did vanquish my demons, after all.\nSMITHY: That rogue? Nay! ‘twere all your doing, my Lord!\nHUBERT: It [were-?] I mean, was?\nSMITHY: Yurr! (ALOUD) Hear ye! The Earl of Mummerset has slayed the false knight, and vanquished his demons! Hear ye!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. RUTAN SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: (FX: BOBBING) The energy lattice! We have it!\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: Yes. With the device installed, we shall have power without limit!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: Yesss!\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN:\nDOCTOR WHO: The entire human species shall be ours! Proxy warriors to command by the billion! Dispensable flesh cages to throw at the enemy until those malignant trolls, the Sontarans, are rendered extinct!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: Then, drone leader — activate!\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: It fits! It functions!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: Yes!\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: Yesssss!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: EXT. EN ROUTE TO MOAT\nDOCTOR: (FX: WALKING BRISKLY) The Rutans will turn planet Earth into a boot camp, turning out clone warriors by the million!\nNYSSA: (FOLLOWING) Doctor, I did exactly what you’d have done in my position!\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING, ROUNDING ON HER) In your position, Nyssa, I’d have —\nNYSSA: 3: Yes? You’d have what?\nDOCTOR: Well, (SLOWLY) I’d have sabotaged the energy lattice in some way.\nNYSSA: Yes, I thought of that.\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED) Good! Good!\nNYSSA: Except they’d have spotted that immediately.\nDOCTOR: (WORRIED) Nyssa.\nNYSSA: So I gave them exactly what they wanted: unlimited power.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Complete, total, unlimited power. Power without limit!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. RUTAN SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: Power levels at ninety-eight percent optimum.\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: Excellent!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: (SURPRISED) One hundred and three per cent.\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: Excellent! Excellent!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: One hundred and ten per cent. And .. rising. (SLIGHT ALARM) Drone Leader?\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: I do not... understand...\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: EXT. EN ROUTE TO MOAT\nDOCTOR: Power without limit? You don’t mean — ?\nNYSSA: I do mean: an energy lattice without its external limiter fitted.\nDOCTOR: But that means —\nSMITHY: (OFF) Look! The castle!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. RUTAN SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: One hundred and forty-three per cent.\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: The energy lattice is faulty. We must remove it!\nDOCTOR WHO: RUTAN 2: But then — how will we survive?\nDOCTOR WHO: OSBERT/RUTAN: Launch! Launch! We will burn off this excess energy at hyperspeed!\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: EXT. BY MOAT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THRUM CAN NOW BE HEARD FROM HIGH KEEP, OFF, AS RUTAN SHIP ATTEMPTS TO UNMAP ITSELF FROM CASTLE)\nSMITHY: The demons are back! Lighting up the High Keep! What do we do, my Lord?!?\nHUBERT: Do? Errr...\nDOCTOR: (STRIDING UP) Nothing! Do absolutely nothing.\nHUBERT: N-nothing, Sir Doctor?\nNYSSA: The demons are seeking to leave this planet. But their, uh, sky-boat is aflame.\nSMITHY: ‘Sky-boat’?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, don’t patronise them. The aliens’ shameleonic vessel is essentially amorphous, but with its energy converters unconstrained, it’s expanding uncontrollably.\nHUBERT: (SLOWLY) Then their — sky-boat — is... blowing... up?\nDOCTOR: Like a balloon! (WARNING) Heads!\nHUBERT: Fireballs!\nDOCTOR: Yes, perhaps everyone ought to take cover?\nSMITHY: A dragon! Saints preserve us! It’s a dragon!\nDOCTOR: No, it’s a Rutan spacecraft.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 120\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) I think we should patronise them, Doctor. (ALOUD) What do you think it is, Smithy? A giant green beast is hurling fireballs at you from the castle’s highest point! Of course it’s a dragon!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?!?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Don’t you see, Doctor? It’s the dragon! Like in the play? This is where that tradition started!\nDOCTOR: Yes, but —\nYOKELS: (RUNNING ABOUT, HYSTERICAL) A dragon! A dragon from Hell!\nYOKELS: Somebody save us! (ETC)\nHUBERT: Run! Run!!!\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) Please, everyone, try not to panic!\nNYSSA: (ALOUD) I’ve clipped his wings, he shall not fly!\nHUBERT: Then cut him down, or else we die!!!\nHUBERT: SCENE 57: FLASHBACK\nST GEORGE: I’ll clip his wings, he shall not fly; I’1ll cut him down, or else I die!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: EXT.

Collapsing in on itself!\nNYSSA: . and that’s that.\nHUBERT: What, the demons are defeated?\nDOCTOR: Conclusively!\nHUBERT: God in Heaven! (FAINTS)\nNYSSA: (WARNING) Hubert!\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING HIM) It’s alright, I’ve got him.\nSMITHY: (RUSHING UP) What’s wrong with the Earl?\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINING HUBERT) Nothing I can see. Exhaustion, I'd say. Delayed shock, that sort of thing.\nNYSSA: 3: What he needs is some sort of tonic.\nDOCTOR: Hardly.\nSMITHY: But — I got tonic. (FX: FUMBLING) Here, in me flagon!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 122\nNYSSA: Funny, that. Doctor, I think you ought to administer the potion.\nDOCTOR: What?\nSMITHY: (FX: PASSING FLAGON) Maud the Withered makes it out of herbs and berries... Put hairs on your chest, that will, my Lady!\nHUBERT: (STIRS, GROGGY) Whuh?\nNYSSA: Just as well it’s not for me. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, if I must. (FX: CORK OUT OF BOTTLE)\nHUBERT: (WOOZY) Smells of elderberries...\nNYSSA: Say it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) “Here, George, take a little of my flip-flop; Pour it down your tip-top:\nDOCTOR: Rise up, and fight again!” (FX: DUB OVER FAINT ECHO OF IDENTICAL PART ONE DIALOGUE)\nHUBERT: (GLUG; SMACKS LIPS) That’s really rather — yes.\nSMITHY: Ere, you called him George!\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. So I did.\nSMITHY: That ain’t George! That’s Hubert, Earl of Mummerset!\nHUBERT: Well, actually — it is George. George of Saint Albans. (ALOUD) Hear me, people of Stockbridge! I am not the Earl of Mummerset! I am George of Saint Albans! A herbalist’s boy!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 123\nSMITHY: So where’s the Earl of Mummerset?\nHUBERT: Dead in Palestine, I’m afraid.\nSMITHY: Well, then — who’s gonna be our Lord, my Lord?\nSMITHY: YOKEL 2: (OFF) It was George saved us all from the dragon! He can be our Lord!\nSMITHY: Three cheers for George of Saint Albans! The new Earl of Mummerset! Hip hip — x 3\nNYSSA: (TO DOCTOR, ASIDE) George of Saint Albans. Remembered as Saint George, who defeated the dragon!\nDOCTOR: I suppose — the story of George and the Dragon is said to have come back from the Holy Land, around the time of the Third Crusade.\nNYSSA: And this is what the men of Stockbridge have commemorated in their annual Mummer’s Play, ever since!\nDOCTOR: It certainly looks that way, yes.\nSMITHY: (OFF) Here, look — it’s Osbert! Coming down from the castle!\nOSBERT: (OFF) Ho there! What’s all the cheering for?\nNYSSA: (TO DOCTOR) Osbert?!? But Doctor, he’s a Rutan!\nSMITHY: (OFF) Got ourselves a new Earl of Mummerset! We’s all serfs again!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 124\nOSBERT: (OFF) Aw, I’d rather be a peasant than a serf!\nDOCTOR: (TO NYSSA) I think... not, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: What then? The real Osbert’s dead, isn’t he?\nDOCTOR: I should say this Osbert’s the last surviving clone, free of Rutan influence.\nNYSSA: The Rutans cloned Osbert?\nDOCTOR: It was Osbert’s memories we heard, back in 1899. Filtered down through the generations. An echo of their ancestor’s experiences here, in the twelfth century.\nNYSSA: The memetic confluence!\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Couldn’t have put it better myself.\nNYSSA: But if Osbert’s descendants were all part-Rutan, even to the slightest degree — well, wouldn’t it be terribly dangerous?\nDOCTOR: Only if someone uncovered their Rutan heritage. Brought out that buried alien identity.\nNYSSA: Someone like — you, perhaps?\nDOCTOR: Oh no. (RUNS) Nyssa! The TARDIS! Quick!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: EXT. STOCKBRIDGE VILLAGE (1899)\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, TALKING) .. I mean, the descendants’ genetic heritage would be massively diluted. It’s not as if half the families of Stockbridge would suddenly transform into Rutans.\nNYSSA: (FX: SHUTTING DOOR) Yes, but they might be terribly traumatised.\nDOCTOR: Quite. (LOOKING ROUND; THERE’S NO-ONE IN SIGHT) Er...\nNYSSA: Doctor, this is Boxing Day, 1899?\nDOCTOR: Fast Return Switch, never fails. The decorations are still up.\nNYSSA: Then where is everybody?\nFATHER CHRISTMAS: (SLIGHTLY OFF, POSSESSED) The Time Lord!\nTURKISH KNIGHT: (DITTO) And Nyssa of Traken!\nDOCTOR: Ah! (WALKING OVER) Father, er, Christmas. And the Turkish Knight. I don’t suppose you know what happened to the fellow who played the dragon?\nNYSSA: Edward.\nDOCTOR: Edward, yes. He was taken — unwell, I suppose. This morning.\nFATHER CHRISTMAS: The Drone Leader has returned to the castle ruins.\nTURKISH KNIGHT: (FX: DRAWING SWORD — SHINK) Aye, and there you shall greet him!\nDOCTOR: Yes. You really shouldn’t play with real swords. It spoils the illusion.\nFATHER CHRISTMAS: Bring them!\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: EXT. CASTLE RUINS (1899)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND NYSSA BEING MARCHED UPHILL. SOUNDS OF DIGGING, GROANING)\nDRAGON: (OFF) Dig, slaves! Dig!!!\nNYSSA: The whole village is here, from the looks of it!\nDOCTOR: They’re digging into the castle ruins with their bare hands.\nNYSSA: Digging? Why?\nDOCTOR: He told you. The Drone Leader. Don’t you remember?\nNYSSA: No.\nDOCTOR: It’d take them too long to grow a new vessel, he said.\nNYSSA: You mean?\nTURKISH KNIGHT: Move!\nDOCTOR: A new ship was already gestating, buried in the ground.\nNYSSA: And it’s still here! Look!\nDOCTOR: I’d say it’s been fully grown the best part of seven hundred years. In the earth. Waiting for a reactivated clone to hear its psychic call. (THEY’RE BESIDE THE SHIP NOW. HAILS DRAGON ACTOR) Hullo there — Edward, isn’t it?\nDRAGON: It is Osbert!\nDOCTOR: Of course. I see you’ve uncovered the entrance to the ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 127\nDRAGON: We shall signal our masters. The mission is a success! Clone factories may be founded here!\nDOCTOR: Well, go on then. Open the door!\nNYSSA: Doctor, what are you playing at?\nDOCTOR: The portal is keyed to electrostatic frequencies. Only a Rutan proper can open it. Or a Time Lord with the knack.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Really?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Twelfth century clones aren’t noted for their wits.\nDRAGON: Sir Doctor — you will work these ‘eel-eck-tricks’!\nTURKISH KNIGHT: (FX: SWORD SCRAPE) Or Nyssa of Traken will die!!!\nNYSSA: (GRABBED) Oww.\nDRAGON: Do it!\nNYSSA: Don’t listen to him, Doctor. You open that door and they can start up their clone factories.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Nyssa. I know what I’m doing. Now, the crystals here make a kind of keypad, so if I just — (FX: STATIC ZAP AS\nDOCTOR: HE PUSHES A CRYSTAL) Ow!\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes, they appear to carry a small charge. Probably stop a human in his tracks. Or a human clone.\nNYSSA: Is that it, did you open it?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately, no. The door has a hexadecimal entry code. I just entered the first digit. (FX: PRESSING MORE BUTTONS, ZAPS WITH EACH) Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!\nDRAGON: The portal is open!\nDOCTOR: Looks that way, doesn’t it? (GRABBING NYSSA, SHOVING KNIGHT BACK) Nyssa, with me! Through the portal!\nDRAGON: The time travellers! Take them!\nTURKISH KNIGHT: Too late!\nTURKISH KNIGHT: SCENE 61: INT. RUTAN SHIP (1899)\nNYSSA: Will they be able to open it again?\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope not. Come on.\nNYSSA: Phwoagh! It smells!\nDOCTOR: Yes, moss has crept in, over the centuries. The ship’s not looking all that healthy.\nNYSSA: So what do we do now? You aren’t thinking of launching it, surely?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR: Do you have an alternative strategy in mind? Ah: the flight controls. (BUSY AT CONTROLS) (FX: ACTIVATION SOUND AS BEFORE. BASSY ENGINES GROWING IN VOLUME) I just need to pilot it far enough into the stratosphere — where it can no longer exert any influence over Osbert’s descendants.\nNYSSA: Then the villagers will be returned to normal?\nDOCTOR: Eventually, yes. I daresay they’1ll collapse, and wake up with very sore heads tomorrow. With any luck they’1l put it down a spot of Boxing Day overindulgence. (EXCITED) A-ha!\nDOCTOR: (FX: CIRCUITS GURGLING AND BELCHING. THE DOCTOR PUNCHING BUTTONS, KNOTTING CABLES, RIPPING OPEN SHELL LAYERS)\nNYSSA: Doctor — that sound...\nDOCTOR: (BREATHLESS, WHILST ATTEMPTING TO FIX THINGS) Oh, no. Atrial dys-rhythmia! The ship’s engines are fibrillating!\nNYSSA: Fibrillating?\nDOCTOR: It’s suffering a heart attack! That’s the trouble with metabionic drive systems. They get cranky with age!\nNYSSA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I know, Nyssa, I know. I need to find some way of stabilising the sinus rhythm otherwise the hyperspatial warp core will ignite — and the entire ship will explode!\nNYSSA: But if it explodes?\nDOCTOR: No more Stockbridge. No more Mummerset, for that matter. In fact, it’d take rather a large chunk out of Victorian England.\nNYSSA: Then hadn’t you better hurry?\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTLE OF FEAR by Alan Barnes (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: (SQUEEZING INTO SMALL AREA) I’m trying, Nyssa. It’s complicated. There should be some sort of metabolic fail-safe, if only I can find — (PAIN) Ow!\nNYSSA: What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: That bit’s hot.\nNYSSA: How long do you think we have?\nDOCTOR: Until it explodes? Not long. A few minutes, if we’re lucky.\nNYSSA: And if we’re unlucky?\nDOCTOR: I recommend not starting any long sentences.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: But what if there isn’t a ‘metabolic fail-safe’?\nDOCTOR: Ah. I was hoping you wouldn’t ask that. If I can just manage to — (FX: AN ALARM SOUNDS ANGRILY, A SERIES OF BEEPS ESCALATE IN\nPITCH AND FREQUENCY. OVER THIS: ) It’s too late... warp core ignition.
