Three forks (dessert, dinner and salad); two knives (dinner and fish, blades pointing inwards); two spoons (soup and teaspoon); and a butter spreader.\nCROSS TO: The water goblet is placed above each guest’s dinner knife; wine and sherry glasses to the right. Napkins are situated to the left of the forks. Everything must be just so.\nCROSS TO: EGG BOILING IN WATER.\nCROSS TO: The days seem longer now. Longer, and filled with a harsh Silence.

Late afternoon I pass by the driving range, and briefly consider a round of golf with Butterworth, the service robot. But Butterworth is very stupid; it would be no contest. Instead I play chess, against myself.\nAQUITAINE: And now I wait patiently in the dining room, till the candles putter out. The glasses remain untouched, the wine — a lively ‘45 Sangiovese — likewise.\nPLATES: SCRAPED, CLEARED. I clear the dinner service, and do the dishes.\nPLATES: At ten o’clock I dim the lights in the sleeping quarters. But the freshly-laundered bedsheets go undisturbed.

Outside?\nSHE: TAPS ON THE WINDOW. THE OTHERS JOIN HER.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: That, Miss, is H.E. zero-four five-zero two-nine five-eight.\nNYSSA: A black hole.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: This vessel - the HMS Aquitaine - is situated on its outer fringes, in the ergosphere. While our primary mission is to collect atmospheric and botanical samples, we have of late been taking ergospherical readings. It has been an interesting diversion.\nTEGAN: It’s.. amazing. Kind of beautiful.\nDOCTOR: I suppose it is, rather. Wouldn’t want to get too close to it, though. — See that light, top left?\nNYSSA: A red giant.\nDOCTOR: Yes. About to be eaten by the black hole.\nTEGAN: Poor red giant.\nDOCTOR: Gamma Caeli, if I’m not mistaken. (BEAT) Still, we have more pressing matters. — Tell me, Hargreaves: why the distress signal?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: It’s my crew, Sir. The crew of the Aquitaine. They disappeared. Seven days ago.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: Disappeared? How?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: That I cannot say, Sir. I... cannot remember. One moment they were here, the next they were not. Tea for you, sir?\nDOCTOR: No. Thank you. How many crew were there?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Four, Sir. Captain Maynard, Doctor Akunin, and crewmen Jennings and Savinio. Plus Butterworth and myself.\nTEGAN: Who’s Butterworth?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: A service robot, Miss, of limited intelligence.\nNYSSA: If there’s no-one else here, then what was that?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Merely one of the voices, Miss.\nDOCTOR: Voices? You didn’t say anything about voices...?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I do apologise for the oversight, Sir. There are the occasional noises - cries, whispers, screams and so forth — but they have no material presence, so I try to ignore them.\nTEGAN: No material... Are you saying this ship is haunted?\nDOCTOR: Now, Tegan, let’s not jump to conclusions. Just because something sounds like a scream, doesn’t mean -\nFREYA: (50 YDS DISTANT) No... Noooooc00o0oo...!\nNYSSA: That was definitely a scream.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes. In this case, you may be right.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nTEGAN: Come on - it came from this direction. (RUNS OFF THROUGH A\nDOORWAY: )\nDOCTOR: Now, don’t just run off, Tegan.\nNYSSA: I think we should follow.

THE DOCTOR ARRIVES\nDOCTOR: Apparently not.\nTEGAN: There could be anything hiding in this jungle.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is running wild rather.

And who might you be?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Hargreaves, Sir.\nTEGAN: But we've just met Hargreaves.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I am the same Hargreaves that you met\nTEGAN: But you don’t look anything like him. wears a sort of... bowler hat?\nTEGAN: before, Miss.\nTEGAN: Hargreaves is tall and\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I inhabit all the droids on the Aquitaine, Miss. To all intents and purposes, I am the Aquitaine. This particular unit is the ship’s horticultural droid.\nTEGAN: Gardener as well as butler? They get their money’s worth out of you.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I perform every function necessary to ensure both the safe running of the Aquitaine and the comfort of its crew.\nDOCTOR: And I’m sure you do it excellently. I mean, you could possibly prune these shrubs back a little more, but let’s not quibble. (BEAT) Hargreaves, we thought we heard a scream come from somewhere around here. I don’t suppose you heard anything, did you?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I did, Sir. A sound very much resembling a scream came from a point four metres to your right, to be precise.\nTEGAN: But there’s no-one there!\nDOCTOR: I think we’ve established that...\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: As I said, Sir. The cries, the whispers, the screams — they are all non-corporeal. I cannot provide an explanation.\nNYSSA: What is this place? Are we still in the botanical gardens?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: No, Miss. This is merely service corridor Beta Seventeen.\nTEGAN: A service corridor? It’s more like a garden centre!\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Yes, madam. The corridors do seem to have become a trifle overgrown, now that you point it out. It seems that these flora are of the same genus as those in the botanical cultivation centre.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nNYSSA: And where is that?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Behind you, madam. Through that doorway.\nNYSSA: Doorway? Where?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Behind the large bromeliad, Miss.\nTEGAN: That shrub? It must be thirty foot high!\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Yes.. Yes, that really should be cut back a little, shouldn’t it? Rest assured, I shall add it to the list.\nDOCTOR: So these plants in this corridor have spread from the room beyond?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Yes, Sir. They were taken as cuttings from the planet EBT- seventy-seven during our recent visit.\nDOCTOR: And that was how long ago?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Around three months ago, Sir.\nNYSSA: But that’s an extraordinary rate of growth. Almost impossible!\nTEGAN: Auntie Vanessa had Japanese knotweed in her garden once, you should see that stuff go.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Hargreaves, I wouldn’t mind a look in this cultivation room.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Of course. If you think it will help.\nDOCTOR: I think I can squeeze... past this thing... Ah!\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING; EFFORT) Right behind you, Doc.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: (FROM INSIDE LAB) Goodness, what a mess!\nTEGAN: (FROM INSIDE LAB) Nyssa, you coming?\nNYSSA: (DISTRACTEDLY) Just a moment, Tegan. — Hargreaves: is that writing?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Where, Madam?\nNYSSA: Just there — on the wall, behind that fern. It’s very faint, but I’m sure it’s writing.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Are you referring to the symbols that have been etched into the moss?\nNYSSA: Thats right. Le starts “L\", “BEB” . then a gape “PRP”, \"1\" .. 42s that a “G\"?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I do believe you’re right. And the final two characters are “B” and “A”.\nNYSSA: \"L.E. — space — P.I.G. — space — B.A.”. Do you know who might have done such a thing? Or why?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Neither, I’m afraid. I do apologise — it is most unsightly. I shall add it to my list.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 6. CULTIVATION ROOM\nANOTHER: LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER.\nTEGAN: Is that... thunder?\nDOCTOR: More likely the ship being tossed about in the ergosphere. Nothing to worry about.\nTEGAN: I wasn’t - (SNEEZES)\nDOCTOR: Dust allergy?\nTEGAN: (SNIFFING) Not usually, no. But this place could really do with a spring clean...\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves does seem to be letting things slip a bit. Perhaps his mind is on other things.\nTEGAN: Didn’t he say there were loads of him, though? Like my Aunt Vanessa always said, many hands make light work.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I imagine there would be dozens of droids on a ship this Size. But they’re all controlled by a single intelligence. A Single point of failure. Well, potentially.\nTEGAN: You think Jeeves has... lost the plot?\nDOCTOR: I’m keeping an open mind.\nTEGAN: So this ship’s from Earth, right?\nDOCTOR: Or one of the colonies. Your descendants, Tegan. Studying the universe, asking questions. Such an inquisitive species. Some civilizations never leave their home planet, you know.\nTEGAN: Yeah. But you know what curiosity did to the cat.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: (ALARM) Nyssa!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 7. CORRIDOR BETA 17, BOTANICAL ZONE [CONTINUOUS]\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Madam? May I be of any assistance?\nNYSSA: Owww... !\nNYSSA: THE DOCTOR AND TEGAN EMERGE FROM THE CULTIVATION ROOM\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? What is it?\nNYSSA: Oh, it’s nothing. Sorry, I didn’t mean to alarm you.\nTEGAN: It didn’t sound like nothing.\nDOCTOR: Why are you holding your arm? Have you hurt yourself?\nNYSSA: It was that plant, there - the one with the fronds. Silly of me, really. I leant in for a closer look at that writing on the wall, and it — well, it stabbed me.\nTEGAN: It stabbed you?!\nNYSSA: There was a spine hidden in the flower. I should have been more careful. These are unknown species after all.\nTEGAN: It’s very pretty...\nNYSSA: Very. And the way the fronds almost seem to follow you around... it’s quite hypnotic.\nDOCTOR: Part of its evolutionary advantage, no doubt. Here, let me take a look...\nNYSSA: It’s just a small puncture mark. The spine didn’t penetrate very far.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: No, but it might have carried any kind of toxin. — Hargreaves, I assume you have medical facilities? Somewhere to clean this up, and check that there’s no chance of infection?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Of course, Sir. My medical counterpart can sterilize the wound and make a full examination.\nTEGAN: Listen!\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Shall I direct Miss Nyssa to the Medical Bay?\nDOCTOR: If you would, Hargreaves. I think Tegan and I should try and get to the bottom of these screams.\nTEGAN: Too right we should.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Very well, sir.\nNYSSA: I’1l come with you.\nTEGAN: No you won’t. You’1ll go with Jeeves.\nDOCTOR: Like Tegan said, best be on the safe side.\nTEGAN: (CALLING BACK) And don’t touch any more plants!\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: ‘Jeeves’, Miss?\nNYSSA: I think that must be an Earth joke, Hargreaves.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Very good, madam.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: THEY HEAD OFF, INTO:\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 8. CORRIDOR BETA 20 [CONTINUOUS]\nAQUITAINE: FADE UP. NYSSA WITH HARGREAVES; HARGREAVES HALTS.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: This is the perimeter of the Botanical Zone, Miss.\nNYSSA: Is it? How can you tell?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I can only apologise once more for the abundant vegetation in the corridors. I really cannot understand how it got here.\nNYSSA: Well — it grew, presumably. And very fast.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: As you say. Yet I have no memory of it not being here.\nNYSSA: That is strange.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I offer no excuse - my horticultural skills are evidently lacking. I am at a complete loss to explain why that might be. It really is very odd. —\nMEDIC: HARGREAVES ROLLS IN — ON WHEELS, RATHER THAN TRACKS\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Ah! And here is my medical colleague.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: (ARRIVING) Good morning, Miss. If you would like to follow me?\nNYSSA: But - when you say you can’t explain it...?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: If you would follow my colleague, he will examine your wound. Good day, Miss Nyssa. (TRUNDLES AWAY)\nNYSSA: What do you mean, ‘odd’? Hargreaves? Hargreaves?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: This way, Miss.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 9. CORRIDOR BETA 10\nRUNNING: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. TEGAN ARRIVES, OUT OF BREATH.\nTEGAN: Anything... Anything here, this time?\nDOCTOR: No. No, just another phantom.\nTEGAN: A phantom?! You’ve changed your tune!\nDOCTOR: Have I?\nTEGAN: Yeah. When I said this place might be haunted you gave me one of your looks.\nDOCTOR: ‘Phantom’ as in ‘a phenomenon with no material presence’, Tegan — not someone with clanking chains and their head tucked underneath their arm.. (BEAT) What do you mean, one of my ‘looks’?\nTEGAN: You know. Half pained, half patronising.\nDOCTOR: Do I really do that?\nTEGAN: I guess Jeeves was right after all — there is no-one else on the ship.\nDOCTOR: But there’s still the matter of the missing crew — which is, after all, why we’re here. And if these apparitions aren’t somehow connected...\nTEGAN: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Well, it would be an extraordinary coincidence.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 10. SICK BAY\nAQUITAINE: A SWOOSH OF DOORS; HARGREAVES AND NYSSA ENTER\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: The Aquitaine medical centre. If Miss would take a seat?\nNYSSA: Thank you, Hargreaves. Do you have some water?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Certainly, Miss.\nDISPENSES: SOME WATER\nNYSSA: Thank you. It’s so hot in here.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: The ambient temperature is regulated at 295 Kelvin - the optimum level for the comfort of humans.\nNYSSA: It must be me then. I’m feeling quite... flushed.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Now - if Miss would roll up her sleeve, I will prepare a local anaesthetic.\nNYSSA: Of course. (ROLLING BACK SLEEVE) Look — it’s swollen.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about, Miss.\nNYSSA: I’m sure you’re right.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: And if Miss should go into anaphylactic shock, then I have all necessary treatments available.\nNYSSA: Very reassuring.\nNYSSA: THE SHIP VIBRATES SLIGHTLY\nNYSSA: Did you feel that?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Miss?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nNYSSA: The whole ship seemed to... tremble.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 11. CORRIDOR BETA 9\nAQUITAINE: DOCTOR AND TEGAN WALKING ALONG METAL FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: Wait.. did you feel that?\nTEGAN: Yes... what was it?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. A vibration. A ripple, even.\nTEGAN: A ripple in what?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t like to say. Interesting, though.\nTEGAN: Interesting?\nDOCTOR: Very. Come on. Quietly.\nDOCTOR: THEY FOLLOW THE SOUND OF THE SOBBING. AFTER A FEW SECONDS THEY TURN A CORNER, AND THE SOBBING STOPS.\nTEGAN: (LOUDLY) Hello?\nDOCTOR: Which part of ‘quietly’...?\nFOOTSTEPS: ECHO FROM DOWN THE CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Shhhhhhh! — Did you hear that? It sounded like footsteps. From down there, I think.\nDOCTOR: This way.\nDOCTOR: THEY HURRY TOWARDS THE VOICE\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nFREYA: Ohhhh... Oh, it hurts. It hurts so much. (SOBS) Make it stop... Sergei, please.\nFREYA: AS THE DOCTOR AND TEGAN APPROACH, THE SOBBING DIES AWAY\nDOCTOR: Nothing. She’s gone.\nTEGAN: Did you hear what she was saying?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Make what stop, I wonder? What happened here?\nMORE: SOBBING, IN THE FAR DISTANCE.\nTEGAN: There it goes again. You still don’t think it’s a ghost?\nDOCTOR: I don’t believe in ghosts. Not the type you mean, anyway.\nTEGAN: What other kinds of ghosts are there?\nDOCTOR: Ghosts are... interference. Projections of things that have happened, or will happen.\nFREYA: (OFF) Maurizio? Maurizio, where are you?\nTEGAN: (GASPS) Look! I saw it this time! All see-through!\nDOCTOR: A young woman, yes.\nTEGAN: Our ghost! Come on!\nTEGAN: THE DOCTOR AND TEGAN START RUNNING.\nTEGAN: You think she’s one of the missing crew?\nDOCTOR: Judging from her attire, I’d say that’s highly likely. I wonder\nDOCTOR: where she’s going?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nTEGAN: Round the corner, quick!\nTEGAN: THEY TURN A CORNER, AND HALT.\nTEGAN: Well — where’s she gone? All that’s here is a lift. Do ghosts even take lifts?\nFREYA: (BEHIND THEM) Oh no... It’s happening again, isn’t it...?\nDOCTOR: Ah. There she is — behind us, you see?\nTEGAN: But that’s where we came from! She’s playing games with us.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think ghosts play games, either.\nTEGAN: She’d better not be. My feet are killing me.\nDOCTOR: I thought you changed into more sensible shoes?\nTEGAN: I wasn’t expecting to do this much running.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (ON PA SYSTEM) Doctor, this is Hargreaves.\nTEGAN: Where’s he coming from?\nDOCTOR: Some kind of ship-wide communications system, I presume. — Yes, Hargreaves?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (ON PA SYSTEM) I’m afraid that there is a.. problem with Miss Nyssa.\nTEGAN: What do you mean? What kind of a problem?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (ON PA SYSTEM) It seems that she has... disappeared.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 12. SICK BAY\nAQUITAINE: [NB: ANOTHER TIME ZONE. ]\nNYSSA: (COMING TO) Ohhh... my head. What was that? (BEAT) Hargreaves, do you have anything for a headache?\nNYSSA: Hargreaves? (SITS UP AND LOOKS AROUND) Hargreaves — where are you? (TO SELF) He’s gone...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 13. SICK BAY\nAQUITAINE: FADE UP ON BEEP OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT\nDOCTOR: When you say Nyssa disappeared...\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: My apologies, Sir. That description was imprecise and possibly misleading.\nDOCTOR: So you didn’t actually see her vanish into thin air?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: No, Sir.\nDOCTOR: But you didn’t see her leave Sickbay either?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: That is also true. I turned my back on Miss Nyssa to prepare an analgesic, and when I turned back she had gone.\nTEGAN: So she could have just walked out of the room?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: The reason I do not consider that likely, Miss, is that she was not seen to do so by the cameras in the corridor beyond.\nTEGAN: Oh. That’s weird.\nDOCTOR: Do you have a camera in this room?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: No, Sir — for reasons of clinical ethics. For privacy reasons there are also no cameras in the bedrooms, the washrooms, the water closets, [the]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Of course... (BEAT) Can you scan for life signs?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Indeed, Sir. I regret to say that the only life signs on board are those of you and Miss Tegan, in this room.\nTEGAN: Then where is she?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: I’m quite sure there’s a rational explanation.\nTEGAN: I’m not.\nDOCTOR: Maybe Hargreaves’ sensors are on the blink? — This ship’s seen better days, after all. No offence, Hargreaves.\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: I would take none even if I were able, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Let’s retrace our steps. It’s a big ship - maybe she got lost on the way back to us...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 14. CORRIDOR GAMMA 12\nNYSSA: WALKS BACK TOWARDS THE BOTANICAL GARDENS.\nNYSSA: (SHOUTS) Doctor! Doctor, hello!\nNYSSA: BUTLER HARGREAVES TRUNDLES UP BEHIND HER\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: May I help you, Madam?\nNYSSA: Ah! Where did you go?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’m sorry, I do not understand the question. Go where?\nNYSSA: You were with me one minute, and the next...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I regret to say that I have never met you before, Madam.\nNYSSA: Not you - the medical droid. I was just with hin...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: As I say, Madam - I have never met you before.\nNYSSA: Now I really have a headache.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Would you like me to fetch the medical droid, Madam?\nNYSSA: No. No, it’s fine. And it’s Nyssa. My name.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: A pleasure, Miss Nyssa. Would you like some tea?\nNYSSA: No. No, I need to communicate with the botanical gardens. Can you do that?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Of course, Miss Nyssa. The Aquitaine is equipped with an intelligent Intracom system covering the entire ship.\nNYSSA: Intracom?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Indeed. Wherever you are, simply speak your instructions out loud and you will be routed to either myself, or to whomever else you choose.\nNYSSA: Hello? Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me?\nNYSSA: A SHORT DELAY, AND THEN:\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) Nyssa? Where are you?\nNYSSA: Oh — thank goodness. I thought — well, I don’t know what I thought. I was all alone.\nNYSSA: A SHORT DELAY, AND THEN:\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) Where are you?\nNYSSA: I’m walking towards the botanical gardens. Corridor... Gamma 12.\nNYSSA: A SHORT DELAY, AND THEN:\nDOCTOR: (ON INTERCOM) Stay where you are — we’1ll come to you.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 15. CORRIDOR GAMMA 12\nTEGAN: Nyssa? Nyssa! (BEAT) This is where she said she was, all right.\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves, can you show us what that security camera is seeing?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Of course, Sir. I will patch its output into my chest display.\nELECTRONIC: BEEP AS HE DOES SO\nTEGAN: That’s.. snazzy.\nDOCTOR: Just us... (BEAT) Nyssa? What are you looking at right now?\nDOCTOR: A SHORT DELAY, AND THEN:\nNYSSA: (OVER INTERCOM) I’m standing directly under a sign that says ‘Gamma 12’, facing toward the junction. Where are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m. that’s exactly where we are.\nTEGAN: This is weird. Are you sure there aren’t two corridor Gamma twelves?\nDOCTOR: (SHARPLY) Both of which lead directly from the medical bay to the botanical gardens?\nTEGAN: I’m worried too, you know?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Doctor, I have identified something rather unusual.\nDOCTOR: What’s that, Hargreaves?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: I have recalibrated my sensors and am now picking up a very faint life sign. But the signal is slightly adrift from its location. Like an echo.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nTEGAN: Doctor - when Nyssa speaks, she sounds like she’s a few seconds out! You know, like when there’s a satellite delay on TV...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was wondering about that...\nDOCTOR: THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND THE SHIP SHAKES\nTEGAN: Not again!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, did the lights just flicker where you are?\nDOCTOR: A SHORT DELAY, AND THEN:\nNYSSA: (OVER INTERCOM) Yes, Doctor. And the ship is shaking...\nNYSSA: THE SHAKING BECOMES MORE VIOLENT\nDOCTOR: It’s worse this time. More violent... Tegan, hold on to something.\nTEGAN: (SHAKILY) I take back everything I ever said about your driving...\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves, can you detect any external cause for the disturbance?\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: Nothing, Sir; though my sensors — my sensors — my...\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: A DEEP AND CAVERNOUS CRASH, LIKE A DISTANT THUNDERBOLT HITTING THE SHIP\nMEDIC HARGREAVES: My... my.. (BEAT) I have engaged the emergency lighting, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Hargreaves. (BEAT) Is there something wrong?\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves?\nTEGAN: Now his lights have gone off...\nTEGAN: THE SHAKING SUBSIDES\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: I think that’s it.. (GETS HIS BREATH BACK) Nyssa, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa? Nyssa!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 16. CORRIDOR GAMMA 12\nAQUITAINE: THE SHAKING SUBSIDES\nNYSSA: Doctor? Doctor, are you there...? Doctor!\nNYSSA: JUST THE SOUND OF STATIC. HARGREAVES TRUNDLES UP BEHIND\nNYSSA: Hargreaves? The intercom isn’t working. Listen.\nMORE: STATIC\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Intra-ship communications are working fine, Miss.\nNYSSA: Listen! There’s nobody there!\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Madam seems distressed. Would one like a cup of tea? I can offer Chai, Chamomile, Earl Grey, English breakfast...\nNYSSA: No. Thank you.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Very well, Miss.\nNYSSA: I don’t understand what’s happening. It felt as though the was being tossed from side to side.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I do not recall.\nNYSSA: But you were here.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I was, Miss. But not with you.\nNYSSA: What?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I regret to say that I have never met you before.\nNYSSA: Hargreaves, you were here, with me. You were.\nNYSSA: ship\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Alas, Miss — that cannot be true. My data records confirm that you were not here, and then you were.\nNYSSA: But that’s impossible.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Nevertheless, it is a fact.\nNYSSA: I was in a corridor, it was covered in vegetation; you were here. And there was writing on the wall, etched into the moss.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Forgive me, Miss — but I would not tolerate vegetable growth in the corridors of the Aquitaine. We have standards.\nNYSSA: But there was.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I assure you, there isn’t.\nNYSSA: The corridor was called Gamma 12.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: This is Gamma 12. Madam is standing in it.\nNYSSA: But that’s impossible.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Quite so, Miss. Are you sure you wouldn’t like some tea?\nNYSSA: (EXASPERATED SIGH) No. I don’t want tea. (ON INTERCOM) Hello? Doctor!\nNYSSA: What was that?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Madam?\nNYSSA: There’s something else in here with us.

After breakfast I rotate the ship eight inches to the left, so I can better chart the Caelum constellation. I vacuum the carpets. Luncheon is at one o’clock. At three o’clock I nip outside to clean the windows of the observation deck. Late afternoon I pass by the driving range, and briefly consider a round of golf with Butterworth, the service robot. But Butterworth is very stupid; it would be no contest. Instead I play chess, against myself. I win.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: After supper I dim the lights in the empty ship sleeping quarters. At eleven o’clock my motion sensors detect two humanoid lifeforms in corridor Gamma 12. I shimmer over to them, and make my introductions.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Good evening. My name is Hargreaves. I am the ship’s computer. And valet.\nTEGAN: I know. ‘Butler’ Hargreaves. Nice to see you again.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Welcome to the Aquitaine.\nTEGAN: ‘Welcome’?

It offers good protection against all environmental hazards, but as you see, it is very heavy to wear. (CATCHES BREATH) I am exhausted. — It is so good to see you. You are with the rescue party, are you not?\nNYSSA: Rescue...? No! No, I fear I’m in just as much need of rescuing as you.\nAKUNIN: (SUSPICIOUSLY) Then who are you? Why are you on the Aquitaine?\nNYSSA: I’m Nyssa, of Traken. I’m a traveller. I landed on your ship, but I’ve been split up from my companions.\nAKUNIN: ‘Companions’? How many companions?\nNYSSA: Just the two. I was talking to them via the intracom; they said they were here, in this exact spot. But that’s impossible, of course.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 41\nAKUNIN: Of course...\nNYSSA: Then the ship started shaking, and I couldn’t hear them anymore.

I got back some time ago, and...\nTEGAN: And?\nDOCTOR: Yours has gone cold, I’m afraid.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Sir, if I might be so bold - there really is little to be gained in searching this entire ship. There are no human life Signs aboard, except for those of yourself and Miss Tegan.\nTEGAN: Then what was all that traipsing about for?\nDOCTOR: You know me, Tegan. I prefer the belt and braces approach. By the way, Hargreaves - last time you checked you said you’d picked up a third life sign.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Did I, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Very faint.\nTEGAN: Like an echo, you said.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: How odd. I have no recollection of such a conversation. But either way. the matter is moot. There is no such life sign now. Your friend is gone. As are my crew.\nDOCTOR: Your crew. Quite. Tell me, do you have records of where each crewmember was last seen?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I do. But if Sir is going to suggest checking these locations once more, I can assure you that my crew are still not there.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m well aware of that. But if we look more closely we may find some linking factor. A pattern.\nCOMPUTER: PRINTOUT PRODUCED\nTEGAN: What kind of pattern?\nDOCTOR: The kind that I won’t recognise until I’ve found it...\nPRINTOUT: STOPS\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I have retrieved the data you require, Sir. These are the locations where each member of the crew was last sighted. There are several square miles to cover. The first two, however, are close together.\nDOCTOR: (TAKING PRINTOUT) Captain Maynard, last seen on the observation deck. Lieutenant Savinio, last observed in the dining area...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Indeed. The other two are some distance away but are both located in the same quadrant of the ship.\nTEGAN: (TAKING PRINTOUTS) Let me see. — Doctor Akunin in the sickbay. And Lieutenant Jennings in the botanical gardens...\nDOCTOR: Ah, really? In which case, we may already have met...\nTEGAN: You mean — Caspar the Friendly Ghost? Brrr! She was spooky.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR: She seemed to be in pain. I wonder why?\nTEGAN: Shall I take those two, then - save us both tramping all over this ship again?\nDOCTOR: If you like, yes.\nTEGAN: You’1l have to tell me what I’m looking for.\nDOCTOR: Dimensional flux. Gravitational anomalies, Konishi anomalies. Quantum phenomena. Three dimensional echoes. Four dimensional echoes, actually. Oh, and if we go down that route, time eddies.\nTEGAN: Doctor, I couldn’t even say most of those, let alone recognise one.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Hargreaves will know what to do.\nTEGAN: Right. (BEAT) Then what will I be doing?\nDOCTOR: Um... taking a note of his answers? Have you got a pen?\nTEGAN: No.\nTEGAN: HE PRODUCES A PEN AND A YO-YO FROM HIS POCKET\nDOCTOR: Here. Oh, and take this as well, to check the gravity levels. You divide the time it takes to descend by the time taken to ascend, and that gives you a value you can approximate to earth normal.\nTEGAN: It looks like a yo-yo.\nDOCTOR: It is a yo-yo. Now, good luck. Oh, and it shouldn’t need saying again, but — don’t touch any plants...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 20.

My laboratory is down just another level.\nNYSSA: It’s so hot.\nAKUNIN: I think you have a fever. The infection taking hold.\nNYSSA: You’ve seen this before?\nAKUNIN: One of my colleagues — Lieutenant Jennings. She too was bitten, and became quite ill. The symptoms — inflammation, rapid fever — the symptoms are the same.\nNYSSA: And what happened to her? The Lieutenant?\nAKUNIN: I gave her the appropriate treatment. She was fine.\nNYSSA: And where is she now?\nAKUNIN: She is here, on this ship. This is a big ship. Perhaps she is with your friends, yes? (BEAT) Nyssa? What’s wrong?\nNYSSA: My legs. They feel numb.\nAKUNIN: It will pass. Here, take my arm. Not much further...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 21. OBSERVATION DECK\nDOCTOR: (FRUSTRATED) Nothing...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Lm sorry, Sir?\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing out of the ordinary on the entire observation deck - just as there was nothing out of the ordinary in the dining hall. (BEAT) Well, other than the fact that your counterpart there seems to cook a three-course meal every evening, despite the continued failure of the crew to turn up to eat it.\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Tegan?\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) I’m just coming up to the gardens. And that ghost is here again. I can see her name badge now, it is Lieutenant Jennings.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 22. CORRIDOR BETA 15 [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Well, that’s something. Is anything different?\nTEGAN: Not so far. She’s still not making any sense. Still running off round the corner every couple of minutes. It’s really creepy.\nFREYA: It wants me to die. It’s killing me, piece by piece. So it can live...\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Interesting.\nTEGAN: Oh, and the gravity’s normal. I think. Tell the truth, I never was much good with a yo-yo.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Well, look out for Hargreaves. The gardening droid should be there to meet you.\nTEGAN: Will do. Tegan out.\nFREYA: I can feel it. Growing. Growing inside me. — You need to get away from me, Maurizio. Run. (MENACING) But run fast, Maurizio. (CHUCKLES) Run fast!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 23. INT. OBSERVATION DECK\nDOCTOR: (TO HARGREAVES) These ghosts. When we first met, you said they were just sounds. Voices. But we’ve actually seen one.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Indeed. I can only assume that my optical receptors do not have the requisite visual acuity to observe these — for want of a better term - ghosts.\nDOCTOR: They’re your crew, Hargreaves. In some form or another. Tell me - was Jennings unwell? Before her disappearance, I mean?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Not that I recall, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Then why is this echo of her in such pain? What happened to her?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: If I might hazard a guess, Sir — it is possible she was injured during the ergostorm. A bout of turbulence, generally brief but potentially damaging —\nDOCTOR: — often experienced within the ergosphere of a black hole. I know what an ergostorm is, Hargreaves.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Sorry, Sir. According to my records the Aquitaine was hit by a particularly acute storm at around the same time Lieutenant Jennings was last seen.\nDOCTOR: Can you check all the system diagnostics that were running when the tremor hit? I want to know if you registered anything out of the ordinary - anything that isn’t explained by the physical effects of the storm.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Certainly. May I ask why?\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves — I think you may have cracked it.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 24. LABORATORY\nDOOR: SLIDES OPEN. AKUNIN AND NYSSA ENTER\nNYSSA: (FEELING WOOZY) I can’t feel my legs. Not at all.\nAKUNIN: The infection is spreading. Here - let me help you onto the (EFFORT) operating table.\nNYSSA: Thank you, Doctor Akunin.\nAKUNIN: Sergei, please. That’s it. Now lie back.\nNYSSA: This is your laboratory?\nAKUNIN: Correct.\nNYSSA: But all these plants. I thought you were a doctor?\nAKUNIN: I am - a doctor of plants. A botanist. But I serve as the ship’s medic too — with some assistance from Hargreaves. The two disciplines are not so far apart, you know. Roll up your sleeve, please.\nNYSSA: Is that an antidote?\nAKUNIN: It will help with the pain. (INJECTS NYSSA)\nNYSSA: (GASPS) That stings.\nAKUNIN: The sedative will not take long. You should feel it starting to work now.\nNYSSA: (WOOZILY) A little light-headed, yes...\nAKUNIN: It is a high dosage. Soon you will feel nothing.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nNYSSA: (DROWSY) And then... will you give me the antidote?\nAKUNIN: What antidote?\nNYSSA: (DROWSY) To the... the infection.\nAKUNIN: You misunderstand me, Nyssa. There is no antidote.\nNYSSA: (DROWSY) No... antidote?\nAKUNIN: All I can do is take the pain away. Hold still, please.\nFASTENS: HEAVY METAL BONDS AROUND NYSSA’S ARMS AND LEGS\nNYSSA: (DROWSY) What are you... what are you doing?\nAKUNIN: Restraining you. Please, don’t struggle. You need to sleep now. Sleep, Nyssa. Spee, zaSsypai. [Spee zas-ze-pie: ‘Rest, now.’ ]\nAKUNIN: Then, when you wake up, the pain will be gone.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 25. OBSERVATION DECK\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: ‘Cracked it’, Sir?\nDOCTOR: The pattern we’ve been looking for. The Aquitaine was also hit by some kind of disturbance just before Nyssa went missing.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I don’t re[call] —\nDOCTOR: I know you don’t remember, Hargreaves, but there was a physical tremor through the entire ship. Twice, in fact — the first barely perceptible, the second really rather unpleasant.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Initial analysis is complete, if you would care to examine my frontal display unit.\nDOCTOR: (STUDIES DISPLAY) Ah... that is interesting.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Are you referring to the power surge, Sir?\nDOCTOR: I am. But it’s not just a power surge.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: No, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Look at that dimensional signature... It’s a temporal flicker! (BEAT) Of course! Hargreaves, this explains everything!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 26. CORRIDOR BETA FIFTEEN\nFREYA: Must... must be something I can do... Something he hasn’t thought of... (FADES OFF DOWN THE CORRIDOR)\nTEGAN: Wait, where are you going..? (TO HERSELF) That’s not what you did before... (LOUDLY) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Yes, Tegan?\nTEGAN: She’s off. Heading back towards the botanical gardens, I think.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Jennings, you mean?\nTEGAN: That’s new, isn’t it? (WALKING DETERMINEDLY) I’m going after her.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Where are you? Hargreaves says he can’t see you on his scanners.\nTEGAN: Corridor... Beta Fifteen. It’s not as overgrown as that one near the cultivation room. There’s some sort of moss growing on the walls. I think it’s covered up the cameras.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Moss?\nTEGAN: Oh, and on the floor. It’s weird. Looks like it’s moving.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Moving?\nTEGAN: Swaying to and fro, like grass in the wind. Except there isn’t any wind.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) It could be reacting to your presence, then. Be careful...\nTEGAN: Uurghs Tt’ s..sticky.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) For goodness’ sake, Tegan, don’t touch it!\nTEGAN: I didn’t! I just stood on it. It’s sticky underfoot. Like someone’s spilt treacle on the floor.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) I think you should head back here.\nTEGAN: No, I want to see where she’s going. Tegan out!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 27. LABORATORY\nSTEADY: BEEPING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. NYSSA WAKES, STRAPPED TO\nNYSSA: Ohh, my head. (BEAT; REALISATION) I can’t move. (PULLS AT STRAPS, TO NO AVAIL) Doctor Akunin? Please, let me out of these straps. (BEAT) Doctor Akunin? Anyone?\nNYSSA: NO ANSWER, JUST BEEPING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT\nNYSSA: Hargreaves, are you there?\nDISEMBODIED: HARGREAVES COMES THROUGH INTRACOM\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Always, madam.\nNYSSA: Hargreaves, can you release these straps?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: No, Miss.\nNYSSA: Can you send one of your droids?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: No, Miss. Doctor Akunin has authority in this area. If he required you to be restrained, I’m sure he had good reason.\nNYSSA: Well, I’1ll just have to try to break the straps, then. They seem flexible, must be a weak alloy. — (BEGINS STRAINING AT\nMETAL: BONDS )\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I’m not sure that is wise, Miss. You may damage the equipment.\nMETAL: BEGINS TO STRAIN, AND THEN BEND.\nNYSSA: That’s the idea... Yes! Come on!\nMETAL: TWISTS AND BREAKS. WITH HER FREE ARM NYSSA: UNFASTENS THE\nOTHER: BONDS, AND SITS UP, PANTING WITH EXERTION.\nNYSSA: There! — I don’t know my own strength. (STEPS DOWN OFF THE BENCH)\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Please, Miss, you should wait for Doctor Akunin.\nNYSSA: Why, where is he now?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Doctor Akunin is currently in access corridor Beta 5.\nNYSSA: And how far away is that?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Ninety-three seconds at average walking speed.\nNYSSA: You mean, he’s coming this way? — Hargreaves, I need your help.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I’m not sure I should, [madam] —\nNYSSA: I’m discharging myself from Doctor Akunin’s care. Is that allowed?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (MISERABLY) It... is, madam.\nNYSSA: Then you can help me, can’t you?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I.. suppose so, madam.\nNYSSA: Good!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 28. OBSERVATION DECK\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Doctor, I have the diagnostics you requested for the other three crew members.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. (EXAMINES HARGREAVES’ DISPLAY) Now, let’s see... There, that’s a definite temporal flicker when Lieutenant Savinio was enjoying his last meal in the dining room... And again when Doctor Akunin disappeared from the sickbay... And once again, right here on the observation deck when Captain Maynard vanished. (BEAT) You see, Hargreaves? It’s not where they are, but when. Your crew has been lost in time.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I am at a loss to explain how I did not draw the same conclusion.\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves... have you ever wondered why you’re never able to keep on top of your to-do list?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Constantly, Sir. In fact, it becomes more of a mystery as the days go on.\nDOCTOR: You do realise that you’ve been rebooting every time one of these ergostorms hits the ship?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Rebooting, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The power surge trips your circuits and to avoid damage, the ship - not to put too fine a point on it - switches you off and switches you on again.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: That sounds most irregular, Sir. And surely I would rem[ember ]... Oh. I see.\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) It’s all here, I’m afraid. Every time the storm hits, you return to your last system restore point and start all over again. It’s why you don’t remember us. And why nothing ever seems to get done.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: But my last system restore point was only seven days ago.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: No, I think it was longer ago than that. — Look around you. The rapid growth of those plants in the cultivation lab? Perhaps it wasn’t so rapid after all. And all the dust... Rather more than seven days’ worth, no matter how far behind you’ve got with the chores. If you’d just give me access to your control panel... Thank you.\nTAPS: AWAY AT HARGREAVES’ CONTROL PANEL\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Doctor, I feel rather anxious.\nDOCTOR: It’ll pass. You just need to — (STOPS) Ah. That is a long time.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Sir?\nDOCTOR: I’ve adjusted your system clock to show how much time has actually passed. Simple, really - there’s a record of each shutdown and a record of each reboot, so you just need to total them all up.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Doctor? How long has it been?\nDOCTOR: It seems the Aquitaine has been circling this black hole for slightly over fifty years...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 29. DELETED\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 30. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nTROPICAL: RAINFOREST SOUNDS. FOOTSTEPS THROUGH UNDERGROWTH.\nFREYA: (OFF) It’s burning... burning inside!\nTEGAN: (STOPPING, TO SELF) Who are you talking to? Is there someone else there? (ALOUD) Jennings? If you can hear me...\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Did you say something, Tegan?\nTEGAN: Crikey, Doc! You made me jump. I was just talking to the ghost. We’re back in the botanical gardens — near the TARDIS, I can see it from here.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) You’re still following her?\nTEGAN: She’s getting ahead of me now. I can’t keep up - this mossy stuff keeps sticking to my shoes.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) Tegan, you might as well come back. I think I know what’s happened to [Nyssa].\nTEGAN: (STICKING IN MUD, NEARLY FALLING OVER) Rabbits!\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) What now?\nTEGAN: I nearly fell over. My shoe’s stuck fast.\nTEGAN: PULLS AT HER FOOT. THE MOSS REACTS BY STICKING FASTER TO\nHER: SHOE\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) I did tell you to be careful!\nSTICKY: SOUNDS AS THE MOSS STARTS TO GROW PERCEPTIBLY\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nTEGAN: (WORRIED) Doctor? Doctor! This is weird!\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) What’s weird?\nTEGAN: I think this moss is growing... (MORE SOUNDS OF MOSS TENDRILS EXTENDING) It is! When I try and pull my foot away, it grows little bit more!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 31. OBSERVATION DECK [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Tegan, don’t move!\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) How will I get free if I don’t move?\nDOCTOR: The moss wants you to move! The more you struggle, the more it will tighten its grip - like quicksand.\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) Right. Okay, yeah, I understand. Don’t move.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Hargreaves, this is urgent. The way that moss is behaving, it’s clearly hostile to animal life.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Hostile, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Worst case, carnivorous. If Tegan loses her balance...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I understand.\nDOCTOR: Can you send a droid to help free her?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’m afraid that will not be possible. The growth in question has proven inimical to my counterpart’s drive systems.\nDOCTOR: Then I’ll have to go myself. Is there a clear route to the gardens?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Via corridor Beta Seventeen — yes, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. (LOUDLY) Tegan? Don’t panic. I’m coming...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 32. PLANT NURSERY\nDOOR: SWOOSHES OPEN; NYSSA RUNS IN.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Hargreaves? Where am I now?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) Plant Nursery Seven-A, Miss. (BEAT) Perhaps you would care to know that Dr Akunin has pursued you from his laboratory, and is heading your way?\nNYSSA: What? (SOTTO) Hargreaves, there’s nowhere to hide!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) The low-level lighting is designed for the growth of non-photosynthetic algae, Miss. I calculate that you would stand least chance of detection behind the culture tank to your right.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: WE FOLLOW HER AS SHE HIDES IN A CORNER, BREATHING HARD. THE\nDOOR: OPENS AGAIN AND AKUNIN ENTERS, CAUTIOUSLY. HE ADDRESSES THE APPARENTLY EMPTY ROOM.\nAKUNIN: Hargreaves will not tell me where you are, Nyssa. Patient confidentiality, he says. Patient confidentiality! (CHUCKLES) Very good.\nWALKS: CLOSER\nAKUNIN: But it doesn’t matter, of course. You really think you can hide from me? I know every inch of this vessel. From the observation deck to the engine room, every last inch. I’ve had a long time\nAKUNIN: to learn it.\nAKUNIN: But let’s suppose I do not find you, Nyssa, what then? You see, the minute you touched that plant, your fate was sealed. You cannot run from what is going to happen to you. You cannot hide from it. I am the only person who can help.\nAKUNIN: HE WANDERS AWAY, STILL TALKING\nAKUNIN: I have seen the infection take hold. You will endure the most terrible suffering, Nyssa. The pain will be unbearable, beyond imagining. I know, Nyssa — I’ve seen it.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nAQUITAINE: HE RETURNS, AND WALKS EVER CLOSER TO NYSSA’S HIDING PLACE. WE\nHEAR: HER SHALLOW BREATHING.\nAKUNIN: Spare yourself. I can help you. You’ll go to sleep, you’1ll know nothing of it. Come out. Show yourself. Come to me, Nyssa. Ot sood’bee ne ooi-dyosh [art sood-bee nee wee-deeyosh] — ‘You cannot escape your fate.’\nAKUNIN: WITH A CLATTER OF OVERTURNED MACHINERY, NYSSA DARTS FROM HER\nHIDING: PLACE.\nNYSSA: (DESPERATELY) Hargreaves, the door!\nAKUNIN: Ah, there you are! — Come back!\nDOOR: SWOOSHES SHUT.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 33. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nTROPICAL: RAINFOREST.\nTEGAN: Doctor? Doctor, the moss is growing... fast. It’s over my ankle now. I’m trying to keep still, but it’s not easy. (SOUND OF\nMOSS: SUCKING AT HER LEG) Doctor, I can feel it sucking at me... like some kind of leech!\nMOSS: A RUSTLING IN THE BUSHES, SOME WAY OFF\nTEGAN: Who’s that? Is there someone there?\nMORE: RUSTLING, AS IF A FIGURE IS SLOWLY AND UNSURELY MOVING\nTEGAN: Nyssa? Is that you?\nMORE: RUSTLING — PERCEPTIBLY CLOSER\nTEGAN: Doctor? Hargreaves?\nPLANT CREATURE: (UNPLEASANT RASPING EXHALATION, ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRANGE\nCHATTERING: SOUND OF ITS MANY FACIAL TENDRILS )\nTEGAN: Look, who is that? Why won’t you answer me?\nPLANT CREATURE: THE CREATURE TAKES ANOTHER STEP THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH\nTEGAN: (SHOUTS) Doctor! Doctor, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) (BREATHLESS) Yes, Tegan?\nTEGAN: (NORMALLY) There’s someone here...\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) What do you mean, someone?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nTEGAN: In the botanical gardens. There’s someone here. Or something.\nDOCTOR: Something?\nTEGAN: It doesn’t... it doesn’t sound human.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 34. OBSERVATION DECK\nNYSSA: RUNS DOWN A CORRIDOR AND REACHES A DOOR ADJACENT TO A\nLARGE: WINDOW.\nNYSSA: (BREATHLESS) Where am I now?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: The forward observation deck, Miss. Offering one of the finest aspects in the entire ship.\nNYSSA: Never mind the view, Hargreaves - does this door open?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Unfortunately, Miss, that is the entrance to the upper airlock.\nNYSSA: What...?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: You are at the furthest extremity of the ship. There is nowhere to go but back. I’m sorry.\nAKUNIN: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Ah, there you are. Admiring the view? Beautiful, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: Please. Keep away.\nAKUNIN: The Caelum constellation. I was twenty-seven when I first saw it. A long time ago now.\nNYSSA: I’m a scientist. I can find an antidote.\nDISTANT: RUMBLE AND CREAK OF METAL\nAKUNIN: You have my sympathies, Nyssa, you really do. But as a scientist, you can see that there is only one logical course of action. Come with me.\nNYSSA: No...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nAKUNIN: There’s nowhere to run, Nyssa.\nSHIP: BEGINS TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE.\nAKUNIN: (REALISATION DAWNING) No!

Are you still near the TARDIS?\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) Of course I am! Where do you think I’ve gone?\nDOCTOR: Sorry. This.. creature. Can it see you?\nDOCTOR: CROSS TO GARDENS.\nTEGAN: (QUIETLY) I don’t know. I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: (OVER INTERCOM) What was that? Tegan, I can’t hear you.\nTEGAN: (QUIETLY) It only moves when I speak. Doctor, I think it’s\nTEGAN: hunting me...\nCROSS: BACK TO CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: Just try to stay calm. And keep your balance!\nSHIP: BEGINS TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE.\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nTEGAN: (OVER INTERCOM) Doctor? The ship’s\nDOCTOR: Yes, here too.

(BEAT) Tegan?!\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS. Where did I leave the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: HE STUMBLES ON THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH\nDOCTOR: Ah yes! Underneath that rather attractive Oeno- (STOPS DEAD) carpus. (REALISATION) Oh no. (ALOUD) Hargreaves? Is it my imagination, or is there a rather large hole where the patch of forest containing my TARDIS used to be? (BEAT) Hargreaves?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 71\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 37. OBSERVATION DECK\nSHAKING: SUBSIDES. AKUNIN HAS VANISHED.\nNYSSA: Doctor Akunin? (TO SELF) Where did he go? (CALLING) Hargreaves? Hargreaves!\nNYSSA: SILENCE. WE HEAR THE SHIP SYSTEMS REBOOTING AND WARMING UP.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Good evening, madam.\nNYSSA: Nyssa. It’s Nyssa.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: My apologies. Would ‘Miss Nyssa’ care for a cup of tea?\nNYSSA: (DISTRACTED) Tea?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I have Chai, Chamomile, Earl Grey, English...\nNYSSA: Where did he go?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Where did who go, madam?\nNYSSA: Doctor Akunin. He was here a minute ago.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: He was not, madam. And neither, for that matter, were you.\nNYSSA: (IRRITATED, UNDER BREATH) Or maybe you just have a very short memory. (NORMAL) Tell me Hargreaves, have we met before?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: No, madam.\nNYSSA: Have you met my companions? The Doctor — not Akunin, a different Doctor. My Doctor. And Tegan.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: No, madam.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nNYSSA: Are there any other life signs on board this vessel?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Yes, madam.\nNYSSA: Yes? Who?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Captain Maynard, the commander of the Aquitaine.\nNYSSA: Can I speak to the Captain?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: That may be difficult, Miss. Captain Maynard is sleeping, and must not be disturbed.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 73\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 38. CORRIDOR\nAQUITAINE: WE HEAR THE SHIP SYSTEMS REBOOTING AND WARMING UP. BUTLER HARGREAVES AND DOCTOR MEET IN A CORRIDOR, STOPPING SIMULTANEOUSLY.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Good evening, sir.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Hargreaves. And then there were two.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: And how is sir today?\nDOCTOR: I’ve had better. I seem to have mislaid both of my companions. Not to mention my ship. It’s really rather worrying.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’m sorry to hear that, sir. Perhaps one would like some tea? I have Chai, Chamomile...\nDOCTOR: English breakfast. Thank you, Hargreaves.\nHARGREAVES: BEGINS BREWING SOME TEA IN HIS CHEST CAVITY\nDOCTOR: I find tea helps me think, you see. (BEAT) You don’t remember me, do you Hargreaves?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Remember you, sir?\nDOCTOR: Remember meeting me. Before.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’ve never met you before, sir. Your tea.\nDOCTOR: (TAKES TEA) Thank you. — You’ve rebooted, Hargreaves. Every time there’s a disturbance you reboot, hence you not remembering anything. I’ve already told you this, by the way.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’m afraid I don’t recall.\nDOCTOR: (SIPS TEA) Excellent tea. — But there’s a bigger problem, alas.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Oh dear me.\nDOCTOR: I think the disturbances — ergostorms, you call them - are becoming more frequent. This time it was fifty minutes between storms; the time before I measured it as fifty-six. Do you know what that means?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Does it mean something bad, sir?\nDOCTOR: Black holes warp time and space, you see? Now, sitting up here safely in the ergosphere, we shouldn’t be affected by any of that. Unfortunately, I think that black hole out there is collapsing.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Goodness.\nDOCTOR: Collapsing, and pulling this ship slowly towards it, sucking it closer inch by inch. Every time we’re pulled closer to the event horizon, the time distortion effect becomes worse, hence the more-frequent time storms.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Oh dear, Sir. That does sound alarming.\nDOCTOR: According to my calculations, the next time storm will be in 43 minutes. And at that rate of increase the Aquitaine, and everyone aboard, will be destroyed in a little over... two hours.\nDOCTOR: END OF EPISODE\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 75"

Hargreaves, there was something here just now. Some sort of creature — I thought it was stalking me. Is it — is it still here?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: There are no lifeforms present other than yourself, Miss.\nTEGAN: Weird. Oh well, one thing at a time - I still need to get free of this man-eating moss before I lose more than just my shoes. (SIGHS) Where’s the Doctor? He said he was nearly here.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I’m not sure to whom you are referring, Miss. Are you requiring Doctor Akunin? If so, I am afraid I am unable to help.\nTEGAN: Doctor who? No, I want the Doctor. He’s probably got lost. Can you tell him I’m near the [TARDIS] - (BEAT) Hang on, what’s\nTEGAN: happened to the TARDIS?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: ‘TARDIS’, Miss?\nTEGAN: It was there a minute ago, and now it isn’t. Great.

CHILLY HUM OF CRYOSLEEP CHAMBERS.\nNYSSA: (WALKING IN) Captain Maynard’s in here?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: That’s correct, madam. The sleeping quarters. As I said, Madam, the Captain must not be disturbed!\nNYSSA: It’s cold.. (BEAT) Hold on - these are cryogenic chambers!\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Yes, Miss. The crew were originally placed in suspended animation for the duration of the voyage to the Caelum constellation. But Captain Maynard was put back into cryosleep more recently, after she fell ill.\nNYSSA: Under whose advice?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Doctor Akunin. When the Captain became incapacitated, he became ranking officer.\nNYSSA: But Akunin isn’t here, is he? He vanished, earlier. (AN IDEA) Which makes me ranking officer.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Madam?\nNYSSA: Your function is to serve the humans aboard the Aquitaine, correct? So if I am the only humanoid being on board, then I must be the ranking officer.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: (WHIRRS, COGITATES, THEN:) Yes, madam.\nNYSSA: Good. Then I order you to wake Captain Maynard.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Certainly, madam. (TRUNDLES OVER TO SLEEPING POD) Captain Maynard is in sleeping bay two.

BUTLER HARGREAVES ENTERS. BEAT.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: (COUGHS POLITELY) A-hem.\nDOCTOR: (PREOCCUPIED) Ah. Hargreaves. Do you have the data from the recent storm?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: As requested - spectrographic measurements of life-signs within the botanical gardens, in the moments before and after the storm struck. You will observe that there are two readings, one of which is human.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. — Which of these lines is Tegan?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: The spiky one.\nDOCTOR: That would be right... So the other is presumably the unidentified life-form that she reported. (SHORT BEAT) It barely registers by comparison. Too little brain activity to be an animal, surely? But too much to be purely plantlife...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Curious indeed.\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves, what happens to Tegan’s line here? It looks like a double-image.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: It is, Sir. Precisely the same readings, but offset by a couple of seconds.\nDOCTOR: Almost as if Tegan was briefly in two places at once...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Does that suggest something to you?\nDOCTOR: When my other friend Nyssa was caught up in the first minor disturbance, there was a few seconds’ delay when she spoke to us. Almost as if she’d only travelled a few seconds back in time. And yet she must have been further removed than that.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 78\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: How can you be sure?\nDOCTOR: We were sharing the same spatial co-ordinates. Would have been a bit messy if we’d been in the same time zone as well.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: How bizarre! It must have been very confusing for you all.\nDOCTOR: It was... Ah! Of course! If Nyssa had merely jumped a time-track, Delahay’s inverse cube law comes into play!\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I’m not familiar with that maxim, Sir.\nDOCTOR: Time-tracks are to Time what parallel dimensions are to Space- Time. They run side by side, like the grooves on a record.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: A record?\nDOCTOR: Yes, a record. Travel along the grooves, and time progresses, or regresses, in a linear fashion. Skip a groove, and the distance you travel increases exponentially.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Or decreases.\nDOCTOR: Or decreases, exactly. So if this double image shows Tegan two point six seconds back in time, in reality she would be... (BEAT) just over three hours away.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Well! That is good news. Although... if Miss Tegan was sent three hours into the past, shouldn’t she be here now? Three hours older than ourselves, but otherwise unaffected by her travails?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Hargreaves, she should. Unless...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Unless Miss Tegan is dead, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves, I need to get to her.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: You want.. to follow her back in time?\nDOCTOR: It’s the only way out of this. Save Tegan, recover the TARDIS, and find a way to rescue Nyssa. Maybe even your crew.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I understand. But Doctor — how can you do such a thing?\nDOCTOR: I need to test a theory...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 80\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 42. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nTEGAN: (CALLING AROUND, HALF-HEARTEDLY) Doctor...? (BEAT) Doctor...?\nSAVINIO: (FROM OFF) Hello? Is there someone there?\nTEGAN: (STARTLED) What the..? (UNCERTAINLY) Hello?\nUNDERGROWTH: PARTED.\nSAVINIO: (STEPPING THROUGH) Found you. My God. Who are you?\nTEGAN: Well, who are you? — Hey, was that you creeping around here earlier? I thought something was hunting me.\nSAVINIO: Hunting you?! (BEAT) I’ve only just got here. I saw you on the security monitors. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It’s been so long.\nTEGAN: What’s been so long? Look, could you help me get free from this stuff?\nSAVINIO: You’re stuck?\nTEGAN: Well, I’m not just standing like this to improve my posture. (BEAT) Yes. Sorry. I’m stuck. It’s this weird moss stuff. There’s a trowel thing over there, but I’ve not been able to reach it.\nSAVINIO: Ah, one of Hargreaves’ attachments. (FETCHES IT) Here, let me see if I can scrape off the moss.\nTEGAN: Thank you.\nSAVINIO: BEGINS SCRAPING MOSS FROM AROUND TEGAN’S FEET.\nSAVINIO: There are some very nasty specimens in the gardens — it’s not a good idea to come here without protective clothing.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 81\nTEGAN: I’ll have you know, these are my sensible shoes...!\nSAVINIO: You’re from the future, yes?\nTEGAN: The future?\nSAVINIO: Well, it was one of the time storms brought you here. And you’re not one of the crew, that’s for sure! So who are you? Part of a rescue party?\nTEGAN: I suppose so. We answered your distress signal. Sorry, did you say time storm?\nSAVINIO: You didn’t know?\nTEGAN: Afraid not. Er, we’ve not been debriefed yet.\nSAVINIO: The first storm hit the Aquitaine about six months after we arrived. It took Doctor Akunin — not that we understood that at the time. We carried on as best we could. Then another storm took Captain Maynard. That left just myself and Freya... Lieutenant Jennings.\nTEGAN: Jennings?\nSAVINIO: You know of her?\nTEGAN: Kind of. A little...\nSAVINIO: We stayed together after that. Became... inseparable. Even after the first time storm caught us. And the next. And the next. That was the only good thing about this nightmare... (BEAT) And then... and then I lost her.\nTEGAN: I’m sorry.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 82\nSAVINIO: That was several years ago now. Who knows how many years had already passed by then.\nTEGAN: You’ve been on your own all that time?\nSAVINIO: I found a safe place. A place on the ship that doesn’t seem as affected by the storms — through trial and error, you know? — and I’ve stuck to it. Until today... (BEAT) Move your foot. There, you’re free!\nTEGAN: Thank you. (BEAT) I don’t even know your name.\nSAVINIO: Savinio. Lieutenant Maurizio Savinio.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 83\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 43. CRYOGENIC CHAMBERS\nTEA: POURED. A WHIRR AS HARGREAVES EXTENDS HIS ARM TO OFFER IT TO MAYNARD.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Your tea, Captain.\nMAYNARD: (GROGGILY) Thank you, Hargreaves. (SIPS TEA; TO NYSSA) Tell me again why you’re on my ship — Nyssa, you said?\nNYSSA: We were responding to your distress beacon, Captain.\nMAYNARD: Is this true, Hargreaves?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I have no record of it, ma’am. Miss Nyssa appeared on the observation deck thirty-three minutes ago.\nNYSSA: (SIGHS) I told you - I’m a traveller. I landed on the Aquitaine several hours ago — not minutes - and since then I’ve lost my travelling companions, been tossed about in some sort of interstellar storm, and been offered tea by Hargreaves with depressing regularity. He seems to keep losing his memory.\nMAYNARD: That much is true.\nNYSSA: Oh, and I’d like to have a few words about your Doctor Akunin too.\nMAYNARD: What of him? Where is he?\nNYSSA: Gone, disappeared. Thank goodness. He’s lost his mind.\nMAYNARD: Lost his mind? Doctor Akunin is one of the finest young minds I’ve ever met.\nNYSSA: Young? He’s older than you.\nMAYNARD: Then you have the wrong man. I have every faith in Sergei Akunin.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 84\nNYSSA: But he put you in suspended animation!\nMAYNARD: To save my life. Without Dr Akunin I would most likely be dead.\nNYSSA: He tried to kill me!\nMAYNARD: We only have your word for that. Akunin isn’t here to speak for himself, and Hargreaves has no record of you even being here.\nNYSSA: But it’s true.\nMAYNARD: You’re from Henriksen, aren’t you?\nNYSSA: Who?\nMAYNARD: Henriksen Biotech.\nNYSSA: I’ve never heard of ‘Henriksen Biotech’. I’ve told you the truth.\nMAYNARD: That’s as maybe. But while we establish just who you are and what happened to Doctor Akunin, you’re to be taken into custody.\nNYSSA: You’re not serious.\nMAYNARD: Hargreaves - handcuff this woman.\nWHIRR: AS HARGREAVES PRODUCES HANDCUFFS\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Yes, ma’am.\nNYSSA: For goodness’ sake...!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 85\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 44. CORRIDOR GAMMA 12\nAQUITAINE: DOCTOR AND HARGREAVES HURRY ALONG.\nDOCTOR: You see, Hargreaves, if I’m right there’ll be fractures, hairline cracks in the.. (TRAILS OFF AS HE STOPS) Look — more of that writing on the wall.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I do apologise, Sir. I shall rectify the situation immediately.\nDOCTOR: Wait, just a minute. (BRUSHES ASIDE VEGETATION) What does that say?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: S-L-E... A-Y... E-\nDOCTOR: I think that’s an F.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I believe you’re right, Sir. F-I-E.\nDOCTOR: S-L-E... A-Y.. F-I-E. Does that mean anything to you?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I speak nearly six thousand languages fluently, and I’m afraid in not one of them does that pattern signify anything meaningful.\nDOCTOR: Even so, someone is clearly trying to tell us something...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Your companion, perhaps? Miss Tegan? She disappeared not far\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: from here.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Can you show me a schematic of the Aquitaine?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Certainly, sir. Will a hologrammatic projection suffice?\nDOCTOR: That’d be splendid.\nELECTRONIC: BUZZ AS A HOLOGRAM APPEARS\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR: Now, show me where the crewmembers disappeared...\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Captain Maynard and Doctor Akunin disappeared here (ELECTRONIC BEEP), on the observation deck; Lieutenant Savinio here (BEEP), in the dining room; and Lieutenant Jennings here (BEEP), in the botanical gardens.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa also vanished on the observation deck, and Tegan in the gardens. And we last spoke to Nyssa in this corridor, which links the two. It’s staring us in the face, Hargreaves.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: What is, Sir?\nDOCTOR: Can you overlay each deck on top of one another? That’s it. A diagonal line.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: The first disappearance was on the lower deck, closest to the black hole, and the subsequent ones on the decks above.\nDOCTOR: Almost like a lightning strike, reaching further each time. You see? A fracture!\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Sir?\nDOCTOR: A line where time is breaking through. Certain places on this ship are more susceptible [to —]\nDOCTOR: A RUSTLING IN THE BUSHES\nDOCTOR: Hello?\nMORE: RUSTLING\nDOCTOR: Hello, who’s there? (BEAT) It’s all right. You can come out. I\nDOCTOR: mean you no harm.\nAKUNIN: EMERGES, CONFUSED AND DISORIENTATED\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nAKUNIN: M-Maurizio? Eto ti? [etta tee?] Is that you? — I’m sorry, Maurizio. I didn’t have a choice. There was nothing I could do for her.\nDOCTOR: Maurizio? Look, I’m not who you think I am. I’m the Doctor.\nAKUNIN: Who?\nDOCTOR: Pleased to meet you.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 88\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 45. CORRIDOR BETA FIFTEEN\nTEGAN: So what happened to your friend - Jennings? I mean, if you and her were sticking together so closely, how come you got separated?\nSAVINIO: She was... unwell. An infection. Something that Hargreaves could not cure. Perhaps if Doctor Akunin had been there, things would have been different, but...\nTEGAN: What kind of infection?\nSAVINIO: Something she picked up in the botanical gardens. From one of the plants.\nTEGAN: One of the plants. (WORRIED) Right.\nSAVINIO: It was a very strange time. After the initial fever, all seemed well again. Better, in fact. She seemed stronger, physically stronger.\nTEGAN: That doesn’t sound so bad.\nSAVINIO: It didn’t last. Eventually this stage was followed by... actual mutation. It was not good.\nTEGAN: Mutation...?\nSAVINIO: I could care for her no longer. Eventually there was nothing of her to care for. I was in fear of my life. I fled. I don’t know where she is now.\nTEGAN: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.\nSAVINIO: It was a long time ago.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nTEGAN: It’s not that — it’s just.. the same thing happened to a friend of mine.\nSAVINIO: Here on the Aquitaine?\nTEGAN: Before we were split up by these time storms. (BEAT) I was already worried sick I might not see her again. And now... now I don’t know if she’1ll even be herself if I do...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 90\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 46. CORRIDOR GAMMA 12\nDOCTOR: How are you feeling now?\nAKUNIN: I’m sorry, Doctor. My head — it gets worse every time. It’s the disturbances. They are... disorientating.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Time-travel is, rather.\nAKUNIN: You too have travelled?\nDOCTOR: Well — yes. I’m something of an authority, as it goes. How long has this been going on for?\nAKUNIN: It’s difficult to say. (CHUCKLES) Difficult — ha! Slovami ne opeesat [slo-vami nee opee-sat], we say in Russian — ‘No words\nAKUNIN: can describe.’ Sometimes you stay in one time for months, or a year. Sometimes you stay for a few days. Sometimes it can be minutes. How can you keep track of time? How can you?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nAKUNIN: It’s been a long while, I know that much. Such a long while. I was twenty-seven when it started — how old do I look now? Forty? Fifty?\nDOCTOR: And you’ve been alone, all the time?\nAKUNIN: No, not always. Our paths have crossed, from... time to time. But they’re always taken from me in the end.\nDOCTOR: I’ve lost my companions, you see. A loud Australian and a young lady about so high, brown curly hair.\nAKUNIN: Nyssa Ovtraken?\nDOCTOR: Yes! Yes, that’s her. You’ve seen her?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nAKUNIN: Yes, but...\nDOCTOR: But?\nAKUNIN: She was infected. I’m sorry, Doctor. By now Nyssa Ovtraken must be dead.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 47. CORRIDOR\nAQUITAINE: NYSSA, BUTLER HARGREAVES AND MAYNARD MOVING ALONG\nMAYNARD: The company warned us about you.\nNYSSA: You’ve got this all wrong.\nMAYNARD: Industrial spies. Saboteurs. The biotechnology field is ruthless, they said. The next miracle cure or bio-weapon is worth a lot of money. But I didn’t think even Henriksen would venture out this [far] — (WINCES) Oooh.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Are you in pain, Captain?\nMAYNARD: Just my leg. Pins and needles. That’s cryosleep for you...\nSHE: STOPS WALKING\nMAYNARD: Right. This is it — Akunin’s laboratory.\nMAYNARD: BEEP OF BUTTON AND DOOR RELEASES WITH A HISS.

What happened here?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: I do apologise, ma’am. I can’t understand it.\nMAYNARD: And you say you broke free and escaped?\nNYSSA: Yes — from that table, there.\nMAYNARD: WALKS OVER TO TABLE\nMAYNARD: These restraints are bent out of shape. You say you did this?\nNYSSA: I.. well, yes.\nMAYNARD: These are Tritanium. That’s impossible.\nNYSSA: It’s not. It happened. Maybe Akunin injected me with something that made me strong. I don’t know.\nMAYNARD: Well, I think we can rule out that possibility, otherwise you’d be out of those cuffs by now.\nNYSSA: No. It’s just I wanted to see if I could reason with you first. But since it seems not... (STRAINS WITH EFFORT TO PULL THE CUFFS APART)\nMAYNARD: What the... they’re coming apart!\nNYSSA: (FINAL EFFORT) Urghh!\nCUFFS: FALL NOISILY TO THE FLOOR.\nNYSSA: Don’t look so worried, I’m not going to harm you.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nMAYNARD: Are you — are you an Enhanced? Henriksen were working in that field, and they’d love to get a look at [our -]\nNYSSA: (INTERRUPTING) Captain, I’m not working for your competitors. I’m here to help. (LOOKING AROUND) What was Akunin working on here?\nMAYNARD: Lieutenant Jennings was infected by the plant, then myself. Akunin was looking for a cure.\nNYSSA: I don’t understand. You’d expect there to be incubators, plate readers, microscopes. But these look more like propagators, for plants. Why would Akunin be growing plants?\nMAYNARD: Cuttings from the plant that attacked us, I presume.\nNYSSA: It doesn’t make sense. I think he’s been working on something [else—] (BREAKS OFF; SURPRISE) Oh!\nMAYNARD: What is it?\nNYSSA: In that jar. That’s certainly not a plant.\nMAYNARD: It’s... a hand. A human hand.\nNYSSA: And look what’s written on the label.\nMAYNARD: ‘Jennings.’ No... No, it can’t be.\nNYSSA: Now do you believe me?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 49. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nTROPICAL: ATMOS.

CORRIDOR BETA NINETEEN\nTEGAN: FOLLOWS SAVINIO ALONG\nTEGAN: Where are we going?\nSAVINIO: To the safest part of the ship — you remember? Where the time storms don’t hit. I’ve been away too long already.\nTEGAN: I ought really to stay around here. In case the Doctor comes looking for me.\nSAVINIO: Tegan, you need to forget about him. And your other friend. You won't be seeing them again. I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: Where is this ‘safe area’, anyway?\nSAVINIO: The maintenance section. Down on the engine level. When we get to the elevator it’s straight — [down.]\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Oh, no! Ahead of us!\nSAVINIO: (QUIETLY) What is that?\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) By the sound it’s making, it’s whatever was hunting me, back in the botanical gardens. But that was in the Doctor’s time. How did it get here?\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) It must have been brought with you by the time storm. There is sometimes a slight spatial displacement... (BEAT) Stay stil.\nSAVINIO: THE CREATURE SHUFFLING CLOSER\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) You say it was hunting you?

What could have happened to him to make him do... that?\nNYSSA: How long have you been in stasis?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: The Captain was taken ill seven days ago, madam.\nNYSSA: You think all this - all of these experiments, this clutter, this dust — you think they all happened in the last seven days?\nMAYNARD: No.\nNYSSA: I think Akunin was keeping you as another sample for his experiments. How were you taken ill?\nMAYNARD: I was stung, by one of the plant samples we took from the Alpha Caeli system.\nNYSSA: A fern? With yellow flowers?\nMAYNARD: Yes — on my leg. I barely felt it at the time. Then I started to lose all feeling. Akunin checked me into the sleeping bay as a precaution.\nNYSSA: May I see?\nMAYNARD: (ROLLING UP TROUSER LEG) If you must. I feel fine now. Maybe Akunin —\nNYSSA: (SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH) I’d say it’s spread.\nMAYNARD: What? Let me — (SHOCK) Oh...!\nNYSSA: It’s the whole leg. Maybe more. I’m sorry.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 52. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nDOCTOR: This is what we’re going to do. We follow Tegan into the past, and with a little luck we find her and find the TARDIS.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Very good, sir.\nAKUNIN: What is — how does it go? — ‘the catch’?\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’re not going to like the next bit, either of you.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Fortunately I am not capable of possessing an opinion, sir.\nAKUNIN: Well?\nDOCTOR: The only way that rift will reopen is for another ergostorm to hit the Aquitaine.\nAKUNIN: Understood. But how are you to know when the next one will be?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know exactly when it will be. But we can’t afford to wait that long. So we need to move things along a bit. (BEAT) Hargreaves?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I need you to plot a course for the centre of the black hole.\nAKUNIN: What?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Are you sure that’s wise, sir?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not. But the closer we get, the sooner the next ergostorm, the quicker we’ll be able to enter the rift and recover my TARDIS.\nAKUNIN: But the Aquitaine will be destroyed!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR: There is that, yes. I’m sorry, Hargreaves. But it’s our only choice.\nAKUNIN: We could stay here.\nDOCTOR: Not really an option, I’m afraid. If we stay here the ship will be destroyed in a matter of hours anyway.\nAKUNIN: Why should I believe you?\nDOCTOR: I happen to have some experience of this kind of thing. And I’m told I have an honest face.\nAKUNIN: You are not flying this vessel into the heart of a black hole! It’s madness!\nDOCTOR: Did you hear what I said? The clock is ticking, Akunin. And it’s nearly midnight.\nAKUNIN: I don’t believe you. There has to be another way. (BEAT) Hargreaves — restrain the Doctor!\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Certainly, Sir.\nDOCTOR: What?\nAKUNIN: You’re a danger to this ship, Doctor. You need to be stopped!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 53. CORRIDOR BETA NINETEEN\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) Hargreaves?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Yes, Lieutenant?\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) Sshhh!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) My apologies.\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) Hargreaves, there’s an unidentified lifeform in corridor beta nineteen. Can you see it?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) I can indeed, Lieutenant. It is a most peculiar specimen. Possibly some kind of mobile plant-life.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Plant life?!\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) I want you to close bulkheads B and C along that corridor. You got that? Seal the thing off, and give us time to get to safety.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) I can do that, Sir. May I enquire - is Sir proposing to return to the engineering level?\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) Yes, of course — (REALISATION) Damn!\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) What’s wrong?\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) The creature is between us and the elevator. We seal it in, we cut ourselves off from the other decks.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) That’s okay, though? Staying here’s less dangerous than having that thing on the loose, surely?\nSAVINIO: (SOTTO) I have to get back to maintenance. And you have to come with me. Please don’t argue.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nTEGAN: Hey! Get your hands off me!\nSAVINIO: Sshhh! (HISSED) Tegan, you’re not being rational!\nPLANT: CREATURE LUMBERING FORWARD FROM OFF\nTEGAN: Oh, and you are? Look, I understand you’re still sore about losing Jennings, but — (REALISATION) Is that it? You’re taking\nTEGAN: me back to your hidey-hole as her replacement?!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Sir, Madam, if I might interrupt...?\nSAVINIO: Shut up, Hargreaves!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: It’s just that the life form [is —]\nPLANT: CREATURE’S VILE RATTLING BREATH AS IT LOOMS OVER SAVINIO\nTEGAN: (ALARM) Behind you!\nTEGAN: IT SHOOTS OUT A TENDRIL AND STABS HIM IN THE SHOULDER\nSAVINIO: Aaaaarghhh!\nTEGAN: (TO PLANT CREATURE) Get away from him!\nSAVINIO: It... stabbed me...!\nTEGAN: Only in the shoulder. Same nasty trick as that plant did to Nyssa.\nPLANT: CREATURE RATTLING MENACINGLY\nTEGAN: Keep back! I’m warning you...!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Madam, if I might make a suggestion...?\nTEGAN: I’m all ears, Hargreaves!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nSHIP HARGREAVES: (SOTTO) On the wall to your right, you will find a carbon dioxide extinguisher, containing pressurised foam for manual use in emergencies.\nTEGAN: Such as attacks by alien plant monsters?!\nSAVINIO: (PAINED) It’s cold. It might... give us time...\nTEGAN: To get to the elevator, I get it.\nCOLLECTS: EXTINGUISHER FROM WALL\nTEGAN: Alright — Savinio, get ready to run. If you can run.\nSAVINIO: I'll have to.\nCREATURE: MOVES CLOSER.\nTEGAN: Ready. Three, two, one, and —\nSHE: SETS OFF EXTINGUISHER.\nTEGAN: Now, Savinio. Run!!!\nSHE: DROPS EXTINGUISHER. THEY STUMBLE-HOBBLE AWAY WHILE THE\nCREATURE: SHRIEKS\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 54. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nDOCTOR: We have a very small window of opportunity, Akunin. It’s our only hope.\nAKUNIN: The Aquitaine cannot be destroyed. It is far more important than you realise.\nDOCTOR: I can save your friends, and I can save mine. Just give me the chance.\nAKUNIN: I’m not a selfish man, Doctor. You wish to rescue your companions, I understand. But can you set their lives against the destruction of an entire species?\nDOCTOR: What species? What are you talking about?\nAKUNIN: It began when Lieutenant Jennings became infected by one of the plant samples we had taken from a dying planet, Vetrius Three. A very promising sample, with many potential applications for human health — but it needed to be handled wth care. Freya was... clumsy. The infection spread rapidly, and I realised the only way to halt its spread was to place her into suspended animation while I searched for a cure.\nDOCTOR: But you couldn’t find one?\nAKUNIN: Oh no, I found one. That was simple — it can be found in the extract of the plant itself. But the plant is quite unique, you see. It produces no seeds; its only method of reproduction is to infect another organism with its DNA. The end result is something entirely new. A new species. So you see my dilemma? As a fellow scientist?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not sure that I do.\nAKUNIN: To ‘cure’ the infection would be to kill it. I would be murdering a new species, butchering it at birth.\nDOCTOR: I see. And you think that would be... what? Unethical?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nAKUNIN: Exactly! The two lifeforms were incompatible — both would have died. I have been working instead to help marry the two species, to unite them. While my patients sleep, the new species grows and flowers inside them.\nDOCTOR: (SICKENED) You’ve been using your fellow crewmembers as host bodies?\nAKUNIN: I’ve created a new species, Doctor. Can you imagine anything finer? For men of science, such as ourselves? Anything nobler? You do understand, don’t you Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I certainly do.\nAKUNIN: I have done the impossible. I have created life. They are my creation, my progeny! I call them my Akunites!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 55. INT ELEVATOR\nDOOR: CLOSES. SAVINIO SLUMPS TO THE FLOOR.\nSAVINIO: (PAINED BREATHING) Engineering deck. Deck Fourteen.\nTEGAN: But the Doctor!\nSAVINIO: (EXASPERATED) The Doctor...! He’s not coming, Tegan!\nTEGAN: He is! I’m going to the observation deck.\nTEGAN: Deck... three. (PRESSES BUTTON) That’s where he’ll be. (BEAT) aren’t we going anywhere? Hargreaves, why aren’t we moving?\nSHIP HARGREAVES: My apologies, Madam. Only authorised personnel are permitted\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Why\nSHIP HARGREAVES: to\nSHIP HARGREAVES: use the elevators, a stricture enforced via the use of retinal\nSHIP HARGREAVES: scans.\nTEGAN: (SIGHS) Come on, then. Guess we’ll have to do it your way after all, Savinio. — Savinio? Snap out of it, Savinio!\nSAVINIO: (SLURRING) There’s something... wrong. I’ve been... poisoned.\nTEGAN: No... No!\nSHE: BANGS THE DOOR IN FRUSTRATION\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Madam, I thought you ought to know that the creature outside appears to have recovered.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: A BANG ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LIFT DOORS.\nTEGAN: Hargreaves, whatever else happens, keep these doors shut.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Certainly, madam.\nTEGAN: Savinio, let me help you up. Just look into the screen, then can be on our way.\nTEGAN: we\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nTEGAN: /SAVINIO:\nTEGAN: Here, is it? — Go on, Hargreaves. Do your stuff.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: Retinal scan... not recognised, I’m afraid.\nTEGAN: What do you mean? It’s Savinio! Look at him!\nSHIP HARGREAVES: I’m afraid the gentleman’s retinal scan does not match my records.\nTEGAN: His eyes do look kinda funny. Sort of... yellow.\nSAVINIO: (CROAKS) Hargreaves... it’s me, Savinio. I’m ill. Please.\nSHIP HARGREAVES: itm ‘SsOLury;> Sirs 1 cannot.\nTEGAN: Oh, come on!\nSHE: BANGS THE SIDE OF THE LIFT IN FRUSTRATION. BEAT.

CORRIDOR\nNYSSA: SUPPORTS MAYNARD AS THEY STUMBLE ALONG\nNYSSA: This way, Captain. Back to the Sleeping Bay.\nMAYNARD: I can’t... breathe. There’s something in my lungs. The infection.\nNYSSA: It’s not far. Come on.\nMAYNARD: I can feel it, Nyssa.. it’s in my head. Something alien, grasping at my mind.\nNYSSA: Then fight it. We can’t be more than a few minutes away.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Sixteen minutes, at your current speed.\nMAYNARD: You have to go. Leave me.\nNYSSA: No, that’s not going to happen.\nMAYNARD: Yes! There’s something growing right here Nyssa, behind my eyes. Something that wants you. That wants to feed on you. It can smell your human scent, Nyssa. And it’s making my heart beat faster.\nNYSSA: It’s not far...!\nMAYNARD: You need to run. You get to get yourself as far away from me as possible.\nNYSSA: But...\nMAYNARD: Now! Run!\nNYSSA: RUNS\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 57. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nDOCTOR: Well, Doctor Akunin - I’m lost for words. Truly.\nAKUNIN: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: To engineer a new lifeform.. quite brilliant. And you say you used your fellow crewmembers for the task?\nAKUNIN: Jennings was more of a test subject, an experiment. Maynard though, she is — or was - the host to my first-born. I thought it only fitting that the Captain should be the first true Akunite.\nDOCTOR: And Nyssa?\nAKUNIN: She too has been infected by one of my hybrids. She too will have evolved into an Akunite.\nDOCTOR: Are you listening to this, Hargreaves?\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: With great interest, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. For a man of such high morals, Akunin, you have a very poor grasp of robotic ethics.\nAKUNIN: Robotic ethics?! What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: A robot — or ship’s computer - may not injure a human being ov...\nDOCTOR: well, you tell us, Hargreaves.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\nDOCTOR: First law of robotics.

Hargreaves, I need you to amputate my arm.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Goodness me, madam. What an extraordinary request.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 120\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 64. CORRIDOR BETA FIFTEEN\nAQUITAINE: THE DOCTOR STRIDES TO HALT.\nAQUITAINE: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: This would be the elevator in question, sir.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nPRESSES: BUTTON. DOORS SLIDE OPEN.\nTEGAN: (INSIDE) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! — Ah. Who’s that in there with you?\nTEGAN: That was Lieutenant Savinio.\nTEGAN: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Oh dear. I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: So am I. (BEAT) Doctor, it was the creature — the one that was hunting me before. It’s still around here somewhere.\nDOCTOR: Is it indeed? Then we need to find the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Suits me fine. Where is it?\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, where is it? It was brought here by the time storm, along with you and the creature.\nTEGAN: No it wasn’t!\nDOCTOR: What...? (BEAT) Are you sure?\nTEGAN: Of course I’m sure! It’s hard to miss.\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand. It was definitely taken by the ergostorm - (REALISATION) Of course! Stupid of me! The fail-safes will have kicked in.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nTEGAN: Failsafes?\nDOCTOR: The Time Anomaly Relocation Distributors! When the old girl detected the anomaly’s effects, she’d have automatically shifted herself forward in time, to prevent herself being lost in limbo.\nTEGAN: How far?\nDOCTOR: Oh, only an hour or two.\nTEGAN: So what do we do? Sit around and wait for it to turn up?\nDOCTOR: Well, we’ve no choice about the waiting, but the sitting around is optional. Personally I’d advise against it.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Indeed, Sir.\nDOCTOR: There’s Nyssa to think about, for one thing. We need to find a cure for her infection.\nTEGAN: Okay. How?\nDOCTOR: You’re not going to like the answer. We need a cutting from the plant that infected Nyssa.\nTEGAN: You mean we need to go back in there to get it? Into the botanical gardens?\nDOCTOR: Yes and no. Yes, we need to go back in there. No, not to find the same plant that infected Nyssa — as it’s most likely dead.\nTEGAN: Then why are we going back in there?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, you’re definitely not going to like this bit.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 122\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 65. CORRIDOR\nPLANT: CREATURE ROARING OFF.\nNYSSA: Could you do it, Hargreaves? Amputate, I mean?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I am a gardening droid, Miss. I do not have the necessary tools.\nNYSSA: You have a saw, don’t you?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Yes, Miss. But no anaesthetic. And no method of sterilisation. The procedure would be painful, and extremely dangerous.\nNYSSA: Better that than... the alternative.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I fear it is too late for such a procedure to work, Miss. Removing your arm will not remove the infection.\nNYSSA: So I’1l turn into one of those things anyway?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Yes, Miss.\nNYSSA: And there’s nothing I can do.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: You could halt the progress of the infection, Miss.\nNYSSA: But how? (REALISATION) Like Akunin halted it in Maynard, by placing myself in cryo-sleep!\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: An admirable idea, Miss.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: ROAR OF PLANT CREATURE, OFF.\nNYSSA: We just need to get there...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 123\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 66. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nAQUITAINE: TEGAN AND THE DOCTOR WALK THROUGH UNDERGROWTH\nTEGAN: Doctor, why are you carrying Hargreaves’ head around with you?\nDOCTOR: Because he’s absolutely indispensable. If a little cumbersome.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: My apologies, sir.\nDOCTOR: THE SHIP LURCHES. METAL INFRASTRUCTURE GROANING, UNDER PRESSURE\nFROM: IMMENSE FORCES.\nTEGAN: What was that? Another time storm?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. I have a feeling this is just an echo of what’s happening in the present. Kineto-temporal feedback — very nasty.\nTEGAN: Certainly sounds it. What is happening in the present?\nAKUNIN: (EMERGING FROM UNDERGROWTH) The Aquitaine is flying into the heart of the black hole - at the behest of your friend here. Isn’t that right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ah. There you are - like a bad penny.\nTEGAN: Doctor Akunin, I presume?\nAKUNIN: And you must be Tegan.\nDOCTOR: (TO AKUNIN) So, you decided to jump in after us. — What do you want, Akunin?\nAKUNIN: Before he decided to send us all to our doom, the Doctor and I were having a most interesting discussion on medical ethics. Unfortunately it was left unfinished.\nDOCTOR: I don’t have time to chat now - sorry. I’m rather busy.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 124\nAKUNIN: Oh, I think you can find the time, don’t you?\nAKUNIN: HE PRODUCES A SPACE WEAPON — CHARGING UP FX?\nTEGAN: Doctor, he’s got a gun!\nAKUNIN: Now will you talk?\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing to talk about. Your so-called Akunites are a biological blind-alley that should never have existed in the first place.\nAKUNIN: Oh, be careful, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You won’t kill me. You need me to save your ship, and its iniquitous cargo.\nAKUNIN: Iniquitous? The Akunites? Who are you to judge them so?\nAKUNIN: WE HEAR THE DISTINCTIVE SHUFFLE OF AN APPROACHING PLANT\nCREATURE: — SNIFFING THEM OUT\nDOCTOR: Judge for yourself...\nAKUNIN: An Akunite!\nTEGAN: Keep well back, Doctor — those things are lethal.\nTEGAN: THE CREATURE COMES CLOSER.\nAKUNIN: A fully-grown specimen — it’s beautiful!\nTEGAN: It’s horrible.\nDOCTOR: I’m inclined to agree. Hardly the new evolutionary paradigm you promised, Akunin.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nAKUNIN: (APPROACHING CREATURE) Do you know who I am? (BEAT) I am your creator!\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Doctor, he’s flipped!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Long ago, I’m afraid.\nAKUNIN: I nurtured you, I made you...!\nTEGAN: How could you?! That thing might have been a friend of yours. — Or mine...\nDOCTOR: Tegan, I’m sure it’s not Nyssa.\nTEGAN: You don’t know that!\nDOCTOR: Look at the scar tissue; the irregular formation of these appendicular nodes. This creature has had tissue samples taken from it, again and again. From what Akunin has told me, I’d say this was once Lieutenant Jennings.\nAKUNIN: He’s right! Freya! It is you..! — You understood why, didn’t you, Freya? We have a saying in Russia - Oo medalee dve storonee [oo med-ah-lee da-vear star-ranee] — ‘There are two\nAKUNIN: Sides to a medal.’ You understand now, yes? Your sacrifice wasn’t in vain.\nAKUNIN: FREYA/PLANT CREATURE: (HOARSELY — TRACE OF ORIGINAL VOICE) Akunin? Akunin!\nTEGAN: (WARNING) Look out, it’s gonna strike!!!\nCREATURE: ROARS AND DARTS OUT A TENDRIL, STABBING AKUNIN THROUGH THE HEART\nAKUNIN: Aaaaaargh!\nTEGAN: That’s what happened to Savinio.\nNOISY: SLURPING SOUNDS\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 126\nTEGAN: Urgh — now it’s feeding on him!\nAKUNIN: (DYING) Chto posyeyesh to I pozhnyosh...

Come on, let’s go!\nDOCTOR: Take Hargreaves’ head, Tegan. (PASSES IT) There’s something I need to do, while it’s distracted. I’1ll be right behind you.\nTEGAN: You promise?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Now - go!\nTEGAN: RUNS OFF, AND THE DOCTOR SQUATS NEXT TO THE FEEDING\nDOCTOR: Now... gently does it...\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 67.

But now... I am cured.\nNYSSA: Stay back, Captain. I don’t want to hurt you...\nNYSSA: MAYNARD/PLANT CREATURE: You? Hurt me? (THROATY CHUCKLE)\nNYSSA: You’re not as strong as you think. Hargreaves?

CORRIDOR BETA FOURTEEN\nAQUITAINE: THE DOCTOR CATCHES UP WITH TEGAN\nTEGAN: Doctor. Did you get it? The cutting?\nDOCTOR: I think so.\nTEGAN: Good. One less thing to worry ab[out] -\nTEGAN: A CRASH. THE SHIP SHAKES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROANS AS BEFORE. THIS TIME IT DOESN’T ABATE, BUT CONTINUES FOR THE REST OF THE SCENE.\nTEGAN: Woah. (BEAT) Is that your... whatever-it-was feedback, like before?\nDOCTOR: It is. And definitely getting worse. Things must be serious in the present.\nTEGAN: Didn’t you say we’re only a couple of hours behind the present?\nDOCTOR: And catching up all the time. We’1ll be arriving on board the Aquitaine before too long...\nTEGAN: But — that doesn’t make any sense! We can’t have already been here when we arrived. We’d have met ourselves!\nDOCTOR: It’s the effects of the black hole. Time is more than usually malleable here. It’s quite possible that the ship could be destroyed before we ever arrive...\nTEGAN: Wouldn’t that create one of those paradoxes you’re always going on about?\nDOCTOR: Ordinarily, yes. But this black hole’s big enough to swallow the paradox without a second thought. Might give it temporal indigestion, but that’s about... (TRAILS OFF)\nTEGAN: What is it?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: The hairs on the back of my neck are standing up.\nTEGAN: I’m not surprised.\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand. When the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up, it usually means one of two things. Either I’m stood in a draft - or...\nTARDIS: MATERIALISING, SOME WAY OFF\nTEGAN: The TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: I knew she wouldn’t let me down. Come on!\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 131\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 69. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nAQUITAINE: THEY RUN THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH TOWARDS THE TARDIS, THE SHIP CREAKING AND GROANING AROUND THEM.\nAQUITAINE: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: What an unusual vessel, madam. Unassuming yet elegant.\nTEGAN: Elegant? The TARDIS?\nTEGAN: THEY REACH THE TARDIS. THE DOCTOR PUTS THE KEY IN THE LOCK. BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Though a little dirty, if I may be so bold. Have you ever\nTEGAN: considered a beeswax polish?\nDOCTOR: Not right this moment, thank you Hargreaves.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 132\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 70. INT TARDIS [CONTINUOUS]\nAQUITAINE: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Goodness! Well, this is unexpected.\nTEGAN: It travels in time as well, you know.\nDOCTOR: You sound almost proud, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Well, it is home. Kind of. (BEAT) So what now? How do we find Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: That is a very good question, Tegan. One that I’ve been mulling over for some time. Unfortunately I still don’t have a good answer.\nTEGAN: You mean — you can’t find her?\nDOCTOR: Finding you was relatively simple, Tegan. For one thing you’d only jumped a single time track — nothing at all in the grand scheme of things; and for another, we had a precise fix on your location at the time.\nTEGAN: And Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: As far as I can tell, Nyssa was sent back several decades. Even if I could get an accurate fix on her location at the time, it won't be any help now. In all likelihood she’1ll have been sent back and forward throughout the history of the ship by successive time storms, just like the rest of the crew.\nTEGAN: Hasn’t the TARDIS got some kind of gizmo that can search her out? Scan for her throughout time as well as space?\nDOCTOR: I’m touched by your faith, Tegan, but unfortunately not.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: So my crew are lost as well?\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: We already know most of their fates, Hargreaves. Akunin is dead; Savinio is dead; and Jennings became the creature out there.\nTEGAN: There must be something we can do.\nDOCTOR: A solution will present itself. It always does. Nearly always. (SHORT BEAT) If only we had more time...\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Might I suggest something, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Um — well yes, of course.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: In a sense, I can go back in time.\nTEGAN: You? How?\nTEGAN: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]:\nTEGAN: I can create a system restore point. In my own memory. If I were to travel back in time I could endeavour to put things right.\nDOCTOR: But.. but that’s brilliant, Hargreaves!\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Well, thank you Sir.\nTEGAN: Would someone explain what’s going in?\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves is the one fixed point in all this temporal chaos. He may have rebooted goodness knows how many times, but he hasn’t physically moved an inch.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]:\nDOCTOR: My crew may be scattered through time and space, but my central processors have not moved from their location in the ship’s core since the day we arrived here.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING UNDER CONSOLE) If we can connect Hargreaves to the TARDIS... with this.. we can connect him to his earlier iteration from fifty years ago.. (HE PRODUCES A LEAD WITH AN ADAPTOR ON THE END) I’1l have to plug you in, Hargreaves, if that’s alright?\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Be my guest, sir.\nBUSINESS: AS THE DOCTOR PLUGS HARGREAVES IN.\nBUSINESS: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Goodness. I feel... (BEAT) I cannot describe how I feel. I do not have the language.\nDOCTOR: Hargreaves, you’re now connected to the TARDIS’ temporal exchanger. If you can reboot back to your earliest system restore point, you’1ll be in contact with your earlier self.\nTEGAN: From fifty years ago?!\nDOCTOR: Indeed. You’ll be entirely in synch — in a sense you’1ll exist physically in both time periods at once. It might feel a little odd.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: Odd is not the word...\nDOCTOR: Now, the TARDIS will prevent you shorting out when the first wave of the time storm hits — you understand? You won’t reboot.\nTEGAN: So what’s he going to do when he’s there?\nTEGAN: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: I thought I would engineer an emergency and persuade the crew to enter the cryogenic sleeping bays.\nDOCTOR: Before the first of the ergostorms takes place!\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]:\nDOCTOR: Indeed. And wake them again in just a few moments from now - enabling you to coordinate a safe evacuation of the Aquitaine on board your own vessel.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nTEGAN: But - that’s brilliant, Hargreaves!\nDOCTOR: That’s what I said.\nDOCTOR: BUTLER HARGREAVES [HEAD]: It’s nothing, really.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and issue the distress call. Don’t forget that, it’s vital — otherwise we won’t be able to pick it up, and instead of coming here we’ll find ourselves wrapped up in a rather nasty paradox. Talking of which — we need to take ourselves out of this time zone, otherwise we’ll get stuck in a temporal dead- end... (BEAT) Oh no...\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa is still somewhere in the original time line. If we nullify that time line...\nTEGAN: You mean - if we change time so none of this ever happened, the crew will all be safe in their ‘sleeping bays’ — but Nyssa will\nTEGAN: be trapped in your.. temporal dead-end thing?\nDOCTOR: Pretty much. Which means we — (BREAKS OFF) ‘Sleeping bays’, of\nDOCTOR: course.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: ‘Sleeping bays’!!!\nDOCTOR: HE OPENS THE DOORS. EXITS\nTEGAN: Doctor, where are you going?! — Wait up.

And we are nearly at our destination.\nNYSSA: Sleeping Bay Five.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I will ensure that your condition is immediately arrested.\nNYSSA: Thank you, Hargreaves. But - who will ever find me? My companions are unreachable... somewhere in the future.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Madam could leave them a message. I would be happy to pass it on.\nNYSSA: Something tells me you’d forget it again long before you had the chance... (BEAT) But you’re right - a message is the answer. Just something more permanent...\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Did you have something in mind?\nNYSSA: (DAWNING REALISATION) Of course! (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Yes, Hargreaves, I do.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 137\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 72. BOTANICAL GARDENS\nAQUITAINE: SOUNDS OF THE BUFFETING SHIP CUT ACROSS THE RAINFOREST\nDOCTOR: Look at this, Tegan. Remind you of anything?\nTEGAN: Yeah. There’s been weird graffiti scratched into the walls all over the ship.\nDOCTOR: Etched into the lichen on the walls, mostly. And faded with age, to the extent that the original messages have been all but lost. This one’s more legible than most, though.\nTEGAN: Still doesn’t mean anything to me, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but to a crossword buff like myself it does. If you put all these fragments together, they overlap rather nicely.\nTEGAN: They do?\nDOCTOR: They do. Here, I'll fill in the missing letters for you.\nDOCTOR: HE SCRATCHES THE MISSING LETTERS INTO THE MOSS ON THE WALL.\nTEGAN: Beeping.. (BEAT) Bay... (BEAT) Five.

CORRIDOR/SLEEPING BAY FIVE\nAQUITAINE: HISS OF WEEDKILLER SPRAY ON WALL\nNYSSA: Will that be enough messages? We don’t really have time.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: I’ve asked my other droid forms to reproduce the same message, elsewhere throughout the ship. (STOPS SPRAYING) But I’m afraid weedkiller spray isn’t the most precise of writing implements, ma’am. This one appears to read ‘Beeping Bay Five,’ not ‘Sleeping Bay Five.’\nNYSSA: Well, I’m sure they’1ll get the gist of it. (GASPS) The infection is spreading.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: The Bay is ready, if you’d care to step this way?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: HISS OF DOORS OPENING. THEY WALK INTO THE SLEEPING BAY AREA.\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Our sleeping pods are medium-range, designed to serve their occupants for up to 100 years. That’s it, Miss — just lie down and relax.\nNYSSA: (LIES DOWN) What if I’m never found? What if I never wake up?\nGARDENER HARGREAVES: Do not fret, Miss. Sleep will come quickly. You will not dream, and you will not worry. You will be frozen in time. When you wake, you will feel rested.\nNYSSA: I do hope so.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: And if you do not wake, then you will know nothing about it.\nNYSSA: (SARCASTIC) Thank you, Hargreaves.\nBUTLER HARGREAVES: Not at all, Miss. Goodnight.\nNYSSA: Goodnight, Hargreaves.\nNYSSA: WITH A HISS, THE POD DOOR SLOWLY CLOSES. FADE.\nAQUITAINE: by Simon Barnard & Paul Morris (FINAL) Page 139\nAQUITAINE: SCENE 75.

Give us a hug...\nSHE: TRIES TO HUG NYSSA\nNYSSA: Tegan, be careful. I’m still infected. I couldn’t find a cure...\nTEGAN: That’s okay, we did.
