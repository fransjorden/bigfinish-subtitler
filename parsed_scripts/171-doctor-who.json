Looks like it was buried by Long John Silver himself.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you mean Captain Flint, Melanie? A TARDIS storage locker\nDOCTOR: is hardly Treasure Island.\nDOCTOR: It’s my rainy-day chest.

The people were renowned engineers. The Great Tower is the tallest free-standing structure in the colonies. Almost two miles wide at ground level, the summit reaches to the edge of space.\nMEL: What was it for? Why did they build it?\nDOCTOR: Because they could! As well as a miracle of construction, it’s a marvel of computer technology. Everything’s automated. Even the artificial atmosphere on the higher levels. All regulated by an enormous A.I. system.\nDOCTOR: Here. Take a look at the tickets.\nMEL: (TAKING TICKETS) Let me see.

Half the buttons are missing...\nMEL: No windows. I’d have thought there’d be a view. It’d be nice to actually see Kalsos.\nDOCTOR: (TRYING LIFT CONTROLS) As with most things when you reach this\nDOCTOR: level of opulence... I’m afraid you have to pay for it! Our tickets would have granted access to the observation gallery. And of course,\nDOCTOR: the best tables in the restaurant will all have a view.

Can you hear me?\nCOMPUTER: (CALM, FAINT) Kalsos Control active.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now. Kalsos Control Computer. This is the Doctor. Can you confirm the status of your power reserves?\nCOMPUTER: Minimal reserves.\nDOCTOR: Structural integrity?\nCOMPUTER: Tower structure... compromised. (BEAT) The Eminence awaits.\nDOCTOR: (THROWN) Wh-- What did you say?\nCOMPUTER: (CALM, FAINT) Structural integrity at sixty percent and falling. Insufficient power for detailed analysis. Fifty-five percent. (BEAT) The Eminence awaits.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 24\nDOCTOR: The Em-- ? (TO HIMSELF) No... It can’t be.\nDOCTOR: (BACK ON THE JOB) Aha, and there’s that vestigial power... If I re-route it to the elevator systems...\nDOCTOR: I’m working as fast as I can, Mel.\nDOCTOR: That’s it! (READING) ‘Supplementary air supply activated’.\nCOMPUTER: (CLEARER) The Eminence has been waiting for you... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET DREAD) Oh no.\nCOMPUTER: The Eminence is returning-\nDOCTOR: No. (WITH GREAT EFFORT, RIPPING WIRES OUT.) Goodbye vocal interface. (QUIET DREAD) It can’t be... It can’t be...\nDOCTOR: Pull yourself together, Doctor. Mel needs you. There!\nDOCTOR: Supplementary air supply. Just enough... Now which floor was she on?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 13: INT. KALSOS TOWER, EMERGENCY SHAFT\nBARLOW: The air’s back on. Jansen was supposed to have shut off all those systems. Lucky for us he’s lazy.\nBARLOW: Right. You still haven’t explained what you’re doing. Or how you got here.\nMEL: We just came for dinner. We got the date wrong. That’s all.\nBARLOW: OK. So I’m not convinced by the ‘why’. Let’s try the ‘how’?\nMEL: Our ship was on the next floor down... only it collapsed.\nBARLOW: They all did. We’re blowing out the internal floor supports before... (BREAKS OFF) You said ‘we’. There are others?\nMEL: Yes. The [Doctor].\nBARLOW: Wait. (TO COM) Receiving you, Captain.\nTRELLAK: (FX: DISTORT VIA COM) Teveler. Report.\nBARLOW: I can confirm the lifesign is valid. Repeat — it’s not a ghost image. There’s a girl in here. Possibly with others.\nMEL: There’s only one other.\nTRELLAK: (D) Copy that Teveler. We’re just running some checks. I’m getting some unusual readings myself. Hold on.\nMEL: We came here for the opening.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 26\nBARLOW: You are behind the times aren’t you?\nMEL: Occupational hazard...\nBARLOW: Should have come up with a better story than that. I mean if you really came for the opening, you’re about eighty years too late.\nMEL: Too late? Then why does everything look half-finished? Who are you and what are you doing here?\nBARLOW: Lieutenant Barlow Teveler. Earth Alliance. We’re here to demolish the Tower!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 14: INT. TEVELER HOUSE ON RIDIOUS IV\nSISRELLA: To Barlow.\nHELGERT: To Barlow.\nANNOUNCER: (ON VID-UNIT) And we’re going back over to Kalsos now. A few days ago, we had a chat with Captain Trellak. Hero of the Ventos system, and now the officer overseeing the demolition.\nTRELLAK: (ON VID-UNIT, HELICOPTER-LIKE B/G) We’re placing timed charges along the whole height of the Kalsos tower. We’1ll run the final, manual checks and then detonation can begin.\nANNOUNCER: (ON VID-UNIT) I understand you’ve had to live inside the Tower for the last few weeks.\nTRELLAK: (ON VID-UNIT, HELICOPTER B/G) We just occupied the lowest levels. We’ve getting ready to blow out the internal floors so that the tower collapses in a predictable and controlled manner when the external charges are set off.\nANNOUNCER: (ON VID-UNIT) Sounds quite a challenge. Any chance it could go wrong?\nTRELLAK: (ON VID-UNIT, HELICOPTER B/G) None whatsoever. I’ve got my best people on it.\nSISRELLA: That’1ll be Barlow!\nANNOUNCER: (ON VID-UNIT) So, with demolition scheduled for sixteen-hundred hours Standard Time, we’ll bring you the countdown as soon as it begins.\nANNOUNCER: Stay right here on Alliance Update. All the news you need.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 28\nSISRELLA: I saw you had two bottles of this fizz stashed in the cupboard, Dad... A bit extravagant!\nHELGERT: I got them last year before they closed the refectory. We can open the other when Barlow comes home.\nSISRELLA: I’m glad you’ve forgiven him. He will be too.\nHELGERT: There’s nothing to forgive. He was doing what he had to. I was... a foolish old man. I was... disappointed. I’d hoped he’d take over the Facility one day...\nSISRELLA: Well he still could. I’1l just be glad to have him home. And to see that thing blasted to dust.\nHELGERT: I don’t know... For all their fuss about it, it’s still only a gesture.\nHELGERT: Until we get some help on Ridious, we might as well still be at war.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 15: INT. KALSOS TOWER, EMERGENCY SHAFT\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS) It’s not good. Teveler. We’re getting increased activity in the computer core.\nBARLOW: Oh no...\nMEL: What is it? What’s wrong?\nBARLOW: Stay back!\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS) What about the Jane Doe?\nBARLOW: She looks... normal. No signs of... conversion.\nMEL: Conversion? Conversion into what? The name’s Mel, by the way. Melanie Bush.\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS) I’m sorry. (BEAT) We’ve got no choice, Barlow. If the Eminence is active...\nBARLOW: I understand Captain.\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS) I can give you a few minutes. That’s all. Whatever happens, you’ll have to leave the girl.\nTRELLAK: If there’s any trace... Any chance the Eminence is still living in the system...\nBARLOW: I said I understood Captain. It has to be done.\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS, OFF) Initiating destruct. The broadcast people won’t like it. But frankly they can go hang.\nTRELLAK: (TO BARLOW) We’re starting the countdown. Good- [luck, lieutenant] (COMMS CUT OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 30\nBARLOW: Teveler. Over and out.\nMEL: What ‘has to be done’? What’s this ‘Eminence’ you’re talking about? Why does it scare you so much?\nBARLOW: Now I know you must be faking.\nMEL: I’m not faking. It’s just... hard to explain.\nBARLOW: (PREPARING HIS EQUIPMENT) Where’ve you been for the last fifty\nBARLOW: years?\nBARLOW: Earth is at war.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 16: INT. KALSOS TOWER, ELEVATOR\nDOCTOR: Come on.. Come on! The power phasing I’ve rigged up should get this\nDOCTOR: lift down to Mel’s floor... And some of the rest of the way...\nDOCTOR: There must be an intercom. Something linked to the emergency systems...\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUZZING AND BUTTON PRESSING AS DOCTOR FIDDLES WITH CONTROLS )\nDOCTOR: Ah-ha! This looks like the broadcast button...\nDOCTOR: (CALLING INTO COMM) Mel. If you can hear me! Stay in the foyer. I’m coming to get you.\nDOCTOR: I’m hoping we won’t have to take the stairs to the TARDIS. It’ll be a bumpy ride, but I think the lift can do it.\nDOCTOR: Just stay put and I’1l be right there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 17: INT. KALSOS TOWER, EMERGENCY SHAFT\nBARLOW: I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry. I’ve got to open the wall up again.\nMEL: Is that some sort of... cable? Are you... abseiling down the tower?\nBARLOW: I was checking the charges. It wasn’t supposed to blow till late this afternoon.\nMEL: But you’re going back out... to try to get to the ground?\nBARLOW: I won’t have enough time. If it’s any consolation. I don’t think either of us is going to make it.\nMEL: No. It isn’t really...\nBARLOW: (COMING TO A DECISION) Oh... dammit. Come on. Melanie was it? Grab hold of me. I’m almost through the wall. If you can hold your breath for the first couple of miles, I expect you’1l still be awake when we get blown apart by the charges.\nMEL: Thanks... but I’d rather stay here if it’s all the same to you.\nBARLOW: You what?\nMEL: Please. The Doctor will be able to help. Just let’s find him and we can-\nDOCTOR: (FX: DISTORT, INTERMITTENT BURBLE OF MESSAGE FROM LIFT INTERCOM) I’1l be right there.\nBARLOW: What was that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 33\nMEL: See! It’s working! He’s got the lift working!\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Going down? (BEAT) And who are you?\nBARLOW: They’ve started. Lieutenant Barlow Teveler. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but... we’re dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 18: INT. TEVELER HOUSE ON RIDIOUS IV\nSISRELLA: Dad! Wake up! something’s happening!\nHELGERT: (WAKING UP) Wha- What?\nANNOUNCER: (VIA VID-UNIT) We interrupt our coverage of the flypast to take you back to Kalsos Tower.\nHELGERT: (WAKING UP) What is it?\nSISRELLA: Look!\nANNOUNCER: (VIA VID-UNIT) We’re being told... Yes... we can confirm... The demolition has been brought forward!\nANNOUNCER: Earth Administration say there is no reason the people should wait any longer to see the final symbol of the Eminence annihilated.\nANNOUNCER: Bowing to the requests of its people watching live throughout the colonies, the Administration has been moved to initiate the destruction as soon as humanly possible.\nANNOUNCER: So. Within minutes now, Kalsos, the last stronghold of the Infinite Warriors, will be no more.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 19: INT. KALSOS TOWER, ELEVATOR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CHARGE EXPLOSIONS BEGIN TO GO OFF, FAR AT FIRST, GETTING CLOSER)\nBARLOW: That’s it. We’ve none of us enough time to get out.\nDOCTOR: Into the lift, both of you. I can bunnyhop us down, floor by floor.\nBARLOW: Even when it’s working, this lift takes twenty minutes to reach the ground. That’s about ten minutes more than this building’s gonna be standing.\nMEL: Barlow’s people are here to demolish the Tower, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah. We do pick our moments, don’t we Mel?\nMEL: Wouldn’t it be quicker just to let it fall? And we all jump as high as we can at the very last minute?\nDOCTOR: While that may work for Mister Wile E Coyote, I’m afraid that in the real world, Mel, we have the immutable laws of physics to contend with.\nBARLOW: No wait... She’s right.\nDOCTOR: What do they teach the military these days?\nBARLOW: The bottom three levels are fully functional. We used them as our base of operations when we were setting the charges.\nBARLOW: If we let the lift drop.. As soon as it hits the right floor-\nDOCTOR: We could use the power down there to put on the brakes?\nDOCTOR: Mr Teveler. I like you already.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 36\nBARLOW: But...\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nBARLOW: It would need instant calibration... Send the right signals to the braking control on the third floor before we hit the deck. Align it with the gravity buffers so we don’t get crushed... The calculations... they’d be impossible!\nMEL: Barlow? I haven’t introduced you. This is the Doctor... ‘The impossible’ is right up his street.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 20: INT. TEVELER HOUSE ON RIDIOUS IV\nSISRELLA: (COUNTING DOWN WITH SCREEN) Twenty... Nineteen!\nANNOUNCER: (CONTINUING UNDER FOLLOWING) Eighteen... Seventeen .. Sixteen ...\nSISRELLA: He’s coming home dad. After all this time... he’s really coming home.\nHELGERT: Yes. Yes he is. (SOTTO) But what sort of a home is he coming back to...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 21: INT. KALSOS TOWER, ELEVATOR\nBARLOW: (SHOUTING) Well, been nice knowing you. Ironic I survive the\nBARLOW: last years of the war, just to get blown up by my own charges.\nMEL: (SHOUTING) We’re almost there Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING) Nobody’s getting blown up, Mr Teveler.. Not if I can help it!\nDOCTOR: Keep an eye on those controls Mel. When the counter reaches fifteen I’1l have-\nMEL: (SHOUTING) Now Doctor — Do it now!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 22: INT. KALSOS TOWER, GROUND FLOOR (CONTINUOUS )\nDOCTOR: Ground floor! Come on!\nBARLOW: I don’t believe you did it. This way! I’1ll see if I can raise the ship.\nMEL: Right behind you, Barlow.\nTRELLAK: (VIA COMMS, DISTORTED) Teveler? Come in Teveler?\nBARLOW: Captain... We’re out of the lift. Level zero. We’re heading for the sub-\nBARLOW: Not that way then...\nDOCTOR: Where now?\nBARLOW: (THINKING FAST) There’s another option. Follow me!\nBARLOW: (FX: SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS AND COLLAPSING DEBRIS, GETTING CLOSER)\nMEL: It’s too late! The whole thing’s coming down!\nDOCTOR: Run Mel!

(TO PILOT) Begin orbital approach.\nTRELLAK: (GETTING UP) Hold her steady on entry. I’1l be in the brig.\nTRELLAK: (EXITING) All the news you need... (SOTTO, ANGRY) I don’t know how they get away with it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 25: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, STCKBAY\nBARLOW: (FX: FUZZY, FADING INTO FOCUS) (CLOSE) Are you awake? Can you hear me?\nMEL: D- Doctor?\nBARLOW: Hello. They said you were coming round. Remember me?\nMEL: B- Barlow? Where... where am I?\nBARLOW: Sickbay. Earth Alliance transport V-K nine alpha. Known to her friends as the Pequod.\nMEL: What?\nBARLOW: My ship. What can I say? The admiral’s got a sense of dramatic irony.\nMEL: Are we on Kalsos still?\nBARLOW: Left there days ago. We’re on our way home. Ridious IV. Home for most of us at any rate.\nMEL: (WORRIED) I... can’t feel my legs...\nBARLOW: A couple of fractures. Completely healed now. The numbness should wear off within the hour.\nMEL: (REMEMBERING) The Tower! It collapsed on top of us!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 43\nBARLOW: Don’t worry. We missed the worst of it. Took a good few minutes for the whole thing to fall. I still had access to the security bunkers. You caught a hit from some debris, but we made it, thanks to your friend.\nMEL: The Doctor! Where is he?\nBARLOW: (SHIFTY) Well, you check out as human. He.. didn’t.\nMEL: What have you done with him?\nBARLOW: Captain Trellak wanted... a quiet word...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 26: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, BRIG\nTRELLAK: So. You’re sticking to your story.\nDOCTOR: As I’ve told your officers, Captain. Again and again. We were there by mistake.\nDOCTOR: Now kindly untie me and we can discuss this matter ina civilised manner.\nTRELLAK: By mistake? Quite a wrong turning. To arrive in the enemy’s seat of power. Just as we’re about to destroy it.\nDOCTOR: We didn’t know.\nTRELLAK: Then you’re the only two people in the ten systems who didn’t. Every channel’s been covering it for weeks.\nDOCTOR: I’m not a great one for watching television...\nTRELLAK: No... You like playing with computers, don’t you? How did you manage to revive the Eminence?\nDOCTOR: Believe me. The very last thing I’d do is offer any assistance to the Eminence.\nTRELLAK: What did you do with that control system on Kalsos? We thought it was dead.\nDOCTOR: I was trying to help my friend. All I did was make a few connections... (REALISING, TO HIMSELF) Ah, yes... a connection.\nTRELLAK: We'd ripped them out just to make sure... but the systems had been down for weeks. Ever since the Infinite Warriors began their retreat.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 45\nDOCTOR: Retreat? (SOTTO) I didn’t think that word was in the Eminence’s vocabulary...\nDOCTOR: So there were no enemy forces left on Kalsos?\nTRELLAK: Only if you count the sightseers.. The Fleet had to keep them at bay. There’s a cordon round the whole system now. Nothing in or out.\nTRELLAK: Which begs another question. How did you get in undetected?\nDOCTOR: My Ship has a.. particular talent for it.\nTRELLAK: So. What’ve we got?\nTRELLAK: A stealth ship.\nTRELLAK: Plus the fact you re-activated the last known refuge of the Eminence.\nTRELLAK: And added to that, I’m getting garbled reports of a ‘Doctor’ assisting the Infinite Warriors on Delafoss.\nTRELLAK: Doesn’t stack up too well for you, ‘Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: When you hear the full story from Delafoss you may think differently...\nTRELLAK: (CONSIDERING) But then... You did get my man out.\nTRELLAK: (ANNOYED) Oh... I don’t have time for this. I’ve an exhausted crew who just want to get home. And frankly. So do I. (GETS UP)\nTRELLAK: Keep him secured. The Administration can decide what to do with him once we get to Ridious.\nDOCTOR: Captain! One question. You say the Eminence is gone... How was it defeated?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 46\nTRELLAK: ‘Defeated’.. That’s one word for it.\nTRELLAK: You should watch the newscasts, Doctor. According to them, the Infinite Warriors were obliterated.\nTRELLAK: By us.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 27: EXT. DELIKUR SPACEPORT\nSISRELLA: (APPROACHING THROUGH CROWD, CALLING) This one’s full as well. Sorry dad. Looks like everyone got to the hostels before us. (WORRIED) Dad?\nHELGERT: (WAKING FROM EXHAUSTED DOZE) Sis-Sisrella.. Oh... I’m sorry my\nHELGERT: dear. After coming all this way... I couldn’t keep my eyes [open]\nSISRELLA: (INTERRUPTING) Our supplies? Where are the ration-packs, Dad?\nHELGERT: That boy, over there! (GETTING TO HIS FEET) I’11 get him...\nSISRELLA: No, Dad! (CALLING) Please! Stop him, someone!\nHELGERT: Give me that back, you young- (PUSHED TO GROUND) Urggh!\nSISRELLA: (ARRIVING) Dad! (TO THIEF) Leave him alone.\nELKINAR: (GRABBING THIEF) Back off! Don’t you know Professor Teveler when you see him? It’s thanks to him we’ve got any food at all.\nELKINAR: Get away with you. (FX: THIEF RUNS OFF ‘Only tryin' to eat...')\nSISRELLA: Elkinar! What are you doing here?\nELKINAR: My people told me you’d been seen down here. Come to welcome home the conquering hero?\nHELGERT: (SCOFFING) Your ‘people’? Who do you think you are? King of the looters?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 48\nELKINAR: (HANDING RATIONS BACK) Professor. Your rations.\nSISRELLA: (SCOLDING) Dad! (TO ELKINAR) Thanks, Elkinar. Barlow’s on the next ship. You should meet up when... (THINKS BETTER OF IT) Thank you. That boy nearly had all our supplies for the week.\nELKINAR: You’re not out on your farm now, Professor. You can’t wave your ration packs about on the mean streets of Delikur. That’s just asking for trouble.\nHELGERT: (GRUDGING) Thank you. Making yourself useful in the City, Elkinar? I’d heard about your rabble-rousing.\nELKINAR: Yeah. Funny you never see us on the news though.\nHELGERT: Is that what you want? To be a famous... troublemaker? Instead of an anonymous researcher who actually makes a difference?\nSISRELLA: (WARNING) Dad.\nELKINAR: I’m just trying to look out for people. (BEAT) Sisrella. It’s... good to see you again. So Barlow’s coming back is he?\nSISRELLA: Yes. We were looking for somewhere to stay the night. But the hostels are full. And the hotels over by the Spaceport are too expensive.\nELKINAR: Look. It’s not much. But we’ve set up a camp under the access ramp to the transrider parks. It’s covered at least.\nSISRELLA: Thanks Elkinar. When Barlow gets here... I- we could...\nELKINAR: Don’t worry Sisrella. We just lost touch, your brother and me. He wanted to be a soldier.\nHELGERT: At least he’s been doing something useful.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 49\nELKINAR: Maybe I should have gone to war. Maybe we all should. At least we’d have got a decent meal every day.\nHELGERT: He was on the front when we took back the Ventos system. I think he’s earned every grain. Don’t you?\nELKINAR: Look. If you want to try it, the camp’s back that way.\nELKINAR: (GOING OFF) Might catch you later. Oh, and Sisrella. I'd... stay away from the spaceport gates tonight.\nHELGERT: What’s he up to? Stirring up more trouble, no doubt. I don’t know what you ever saw in him. He just-\nSISRELLA: (INTERRUPTING) No, Dad. Look at the deprivation here. It’s worse than we thought. (BEAT) You can’t blame Elkinar.\nHELGERT: Maybe not. But I can still dislike the fellow.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 28: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS\nBARLOW: (WALKING) Just let me do the talking. The Captain needs careful\nBARLOW: handling.\nMEL: (WALKING) All I want is to see the Doctor. Make sure he’s all right. Surely your Captain can’t refuse that? Is this her cabin? The one with the guard?\nBARLOW: Trooper.\nGUARD: Sir!\nTRELLAK: (VIA COM) Who is it?\nBARLOW: (TO INTERCOM) Teveler, ma’am. And the... civilian.\nBARLOW: (VIA COM) Come.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 29: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS\nMEL: (STORMING IN) Captain Trellak? Why are you keeping the Doctor locked up? He’s not some common criminal you know.\nTRELLAK: What would you call a collaborator?\nMEL: That’s nonsense. He saved me and he saved Barlow here. The Doctor would never collaborate with anyone against the Earth Alliance, or whatever it is you call yourselves.\nMEL: You might be the Captain here. But you’ve got everything just about as wrong as you can get it.\nBARLOW: Mel! Sorry, Captain. I did ask...\nTRELLAK: Lieutenant. Give me a moment.\nTRELLAK: (BEAT) Now. Young woman.\nMEL: I'm Mel. Mel Bush\nTRELLAK: Miss Bush. Frankly, you’ve got Barlow to thank that you’re not in the brig yourself. So you’d be well advised to listen to him.\nTRELLAK: The fact remains that your friend — this... Doctor - has been in contact with the Eminence. We were tracking the Computer logs in the Kalsos Tower right up to the end.\nMEL: You all keep talking about this Eminence. I’ve never heard of ieee\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 52\nTRELLAK: I can’t quite believe that, Miss Bush.\nBARLOW: I think she’s telling the truth ma’am. Perhaps they’re from an outer colony?\nTRELLAK: You’ve never heard of the Infinite Warriors? The Breath of Forever?\nMEL: No. None of it, Captain. This ‘Eminence’, or whatever it is... it’s got nothing to do with me. Or the Doctor.\nTRELLAK: (CALLING) Trooper. Take Miss Bush outside for a moment.\nGUARD: Ma’am!\nMEL: But I haven’t finished-\nTRELLAK: You've said all you need to. I just want a word with Barlow and then I’1l send you to see your precious Doctor.\nMEL: (SURPRISED) Thank you, Captain... I-\nTRELLAK: Now get out before I change my mind.\nBARLOW: You're... letting her see him, Ma’am?\nTRELLAK: Yes. Well. We’ve got nothing out of him. Keep them under observation. See if they give us anything more when they’re together.\nBARLOW: Aye, Captain. Though I’m starting to think they really have come from somewhere else...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 53\nTRELLAK: Well. Let’s find out. (BEAT) Oh, and Lieutenant.\nBARLOW: Ma’am?\nTRELLAK: Keep them both in your sights. Any sign of... transformation. You know what to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 30: EXT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE DELIKUR SPACEPORT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CROWDS, OFF. SISRELLA AND HELGERT LAYING OUT SLEEPING BAGS)\nSISRELLA: Not the height of luxury. But at least the ground’s level.\nHELGERT: If a little hard on the bones...\nSISRELLA: Here. I’1l put my coat under you...\nHELGERT: Don’t fuss Sisrella!\nELKINAR: (OFF, CALLING TO CROWD) Look! The lights in the sky! We can see the transports coming in! What do you think the soldiers have been living on all this time? Fresh air?\nELKINAR: [ (UNDER FOLLOWING) Come on. Gather round. You might be interested in what I’ve got to say.\nELKINAR: This time we can do something. This time we can actually take control of our lives...]\nHELGERT: (SIGHS) If we’ve got that racket going on we’re neither of us going to sleep.\nSISRELLA: It’s Elkinar... What’s he saying?\nHELGERT: Some nonsense about ‘exploitation of the masses’ again, no doubt.\nSISRELLA: No.. he’s planning something. He told us to stay away from the spaceport gates...\nHELGERT: I wonder what your brother will think when he gets here and sees this... chaos?\nELKINAR: (OFF, SPEAKING TO CROWD) Those military transports up there are all packed with supplies!\nELKINAR: That’s food that could feed us! Feed our families! Why should\nELKINAR: i ' ? ! BSR WAP SUBSE MG YEohAGsPLenty? For years!\nELKINAR: Page 55 (FX: ANGRY CROWD) [It’s not fair! We want our share! Shame! ]\nELKINAR: (OFF, SPEAKING TO CROWD) Every penny you’ve ever paid to Earth Administration. It’s all gone towards the war. And it’s not just your income taxes. Every journey you make. Every grain of rice you buy. There’s a levy that goes straight into the war- chest of Earth Administration.\nELKINAR: Into the hands of Walter Vincent. He’s down there on Earth, light years away, in his tropical mansion. You think he knows where his next meal’s coming from? Damn right he does. Straight out of our pockets!\nELKINAR: You heard him this morning! We’re all in this together!\nELKINAR: You bought every last gram of the army’s supplies with your hard earned credits.\nELKINAR: So let’s go and collect what we’ve paid for!\nELKINAR: (FX: CHEERING) [Yeah! Let’s do it! Come on! Let’s go!]\nELKINAR: (FX: DURING THE CROWD'S CHEERS, WE SHIFT FOCUS BACK INTO THE TUNNEL TO SISRELLA AND HELGERT. ONCE MORE ELKINAR'S SPEECH IS HEARD 'OFF'.)\nELKINAR: (OFF) I need some volunteers. We’ve got the key-codes for a short- range shuttle.\nELKINAR: I’ve a pilot and twenty spaces on board for those who want to take back what they’re owed!\nELKINAR: We just need to get through this fence.\nSISRELLA: Listen, Dad. Did you hear what he said?\nHELGERT: All I can hear is my stomach rumbling.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 31: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, BRIG\nMEL: (RUSHING IN) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (RELIEVED) Mel. You’re safe.\nDOCTOR: I'd... get up and offer you my seat. But as you can see, I’ma little tied up.\nMEL: You shouldn’t be treating him like this. Let him go!\nDOCTOR: I take it that you engineered this meeting... Lieutenant Engineer\nDOCTOR: Teveler? Thank you.\nBARLOW: Thank the Captain. You’ve got five minutes.\nBARLOW: Trooper, with me.\nDOCTOR: So.. Another fine mess. I’m sorry, Mel...\nMEL: It’s not your fault Doctor. Apparently we’ll be landing soon and we can sort this out with someone in authority.\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope so. How are you feeling, after that building fell on\nDOCTOR: you?\nMEL: A bit groggy when I woke up. But now I feel good as new.\nMEL: Barlow said my leg was broken. But I’d never know it. Space medicine, eh?\nMEL: What about you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 57\nDOCTOR: I’m in one piece. No ‘space medicine’ required. A few bruises, that was all. We've... been on this ship for days, you know.\nMEL: Yes. Barlow told me. You’ve been kept in here all that time?\nDOCTOR: (SHIFTING UNCOMFORTABLY) Unfortunately, yes. It’s doing nothing for my posture...\nDOCTOR: Your friend, Barlow. What else did he tell you?\nMEL: The Earth forces have just come out of some fifty-year war.\nDOCTOR: So I gather. With the Infinite Warriors and their slave armies. It’s not like ‘the Eminence’ to simply disappear...\nMEL: (SURPRISED) Oh. So you do know about it? I didn’t think you’d- [ever encountered it before. ]\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) The TARDIS. It must be back on Kalsos. Buried under tonnes of rubble.\nMEL: What is this ‘Eminence’. What happened when you met it before?\nDOCTOR: Mel. Please. (CLOSE, WHISPER) Don’t ask me any more. Walls have ears.\nMEL: (WHISPER) Ah. The glass... It’s an observation window.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Our priority now is to contact someone in authority and find a way back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 32: EXT. OUTSIDE DELIKUR SPACEPORT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CROWDS BREAKING DOWN FENCES. SISRELLA AND HELGERT ARE WATCHING FROM A DISTANCE)\nELKINAR: (OFF) Who’s with me? You men. Bring your weapons. They might need some persuasion!\nELKINAR: (GOING FURTHER OFF) Let’s take back what’s ours! (DISTANT) Come on. To the gates!\nSISRELLA: He’s actually doing it. They’re storming the spaceport\nSISRELLA: barriers.\nSISRELLA: (FX: DISTANT CRASHES OF FENCES BEING BROKEN OPEN, SOUND OF CROWD GOES OFF)\nHELGERT: Look at them. Idiots. They can’t all get on board.\nSISRELLA: Oh my God. Where are the security people? Where are the guards? It’s just mayhem down there.\nHELGERT: Then the sooner Barlow’s people get here, the better.\nHELGERT: With any luck those fools are going to kill themselves taking off.\nSISRELLA: Dad! You don’t mean that.\nHELGERT: Of course not... But.. they’re just making it worse for everyone.\nHELGERT: If Elkinar expended half the energy on research that he’s doing here... He had the makings of a good biologist once.\nSISRELLA: What will happen if they do make it up there..? Up to the Alliance ships?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 59\nHELGERT: Barlow’s unit has spent the last few years up against the Infinite Warriors. I don’t think Elkinar’s band of chancers will pose much of a threat.\nSISRELLA: Well, they made it out of the landing bay...\nHELGERT: They’1l be back with their tail between their legs by morning. At least we might be able to get some rest now...\nSISRELLA: You sleep, Dad. You need it.\nSISRELLA: (SOTTO) But I don’t think I should risk it... Not if we want to wake up in one piece...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 33: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, BRIG\nBARLOW: Right, you two. Time’s up.\nDOCTOR: Remember what I said, Mel. Stay calm. (TO BARLOW) Treat her well Lieutenant.\nBARLOW: We’re not savages.\nDOCTOR: But you are eavesdroppers. Have you and your Captain learned anything of interest?\nBARLOW: You can forget going back to Kalsos, if that’s what you’re planning.\nMEL: But you know we have to! We’ve got to find a way back somehow.\nBARLOW: And if you keep asking when we get to Ridious, they’re going to want to know why...\nMEL: We've told you why. To get to our ship.\nBARLOW: If it really was in that Tower, it won’t be much use to you now.\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS has survived worse...\nBARLOW: Look. We’1ll hand you over to the colony authorities on Ridious IV. They’1ll check everything out.\nMEL: Good. Then we’1ll soon be on our way out of this madness.\nBARLOW: I wouldn’t get your hopes up. At the moment the Captain has you pegged as Eminence spies.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 61\nDOCTOR: You know as well as I do, Lieutenant. The Eminence doesn’t need spies. It just occupies the mind of those it chooses.\nDOCTOR: Look at me.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING ANGRY) Is my skin cracked and grey? Are my eyes aglow with fire? Do I speak with the ‘voice of death’?\nDOCTOR: (ADAMANT, CONVINCING HIMSELF AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS) No! I am not under the influence of the Eminence and never will be!\nMEL: (TAKEN ABACK) Doctor... It’s all right. You believe him, don’t you Barlow?\nBARLOW: It’s true. I’ve seen the effect of the Breath of Forever.\nMEL: Can you tell me what it is? This Eminence?\nBARLOW: Nobody knows. Not really. We just saw what it could do.\nDOCTOR: A gaseous intelligence. Capable of transporting itself across the galaxy housed inside teleportation caskets.\nBARLOW: Whenever the Infinite Warriors extended their front. The Eminence would send another casket. Force its slaves to breathe in the Breath of Forever.\nDOCTOR: An orange mist containing the essence of the Eminence. Anyone who breathes it in is.. transformed... into an Infinite Warrior.\nMEL: A what?\nDOCTOR: An invincible walking cadaver. All memory of its human life is gone. The skin calcifies. An orange energy burns from within... Through the eyes, through the cracks in the skin...\nMEL: That’s horrible...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 62\nBARLOW: So, you do know.. The Eminence seemed unstoppable. Until... it stopped...\nMEL: How did you manage to beat them?\nBARLOW: We... didn’t. Four months ago, the Eminence armies began pulling back. Retreating. We’d find ghost ships full of the bodies of slave warriors. Dead. Abandoned. They withdrew all the way-\nDOCTOR: To Kalsos.\nBARLOW: So you see why it’s probably a bad idea to try and get there.\nMEL: I think I’m beginning to. So Doctor, what’s our next move?\nBARLOW: Now, what’s that?\nDOCTOR: Oooh... trouble.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 34: INT.

I’m on my way.\nPILOT: (VIA COM) They’re locked on, Captain. They’re blasting the hull\nPILOT: doors open into storage.\nTRELLAK: Change of plan. Get a security detail down to the bays. I’1l meet them there.\nTRELLAK: Lieutenant Teveler?\nBARLOW: (VIA COM) Captain? What’s happening?\nTRELLAK: (RUNNING) Trouble near the brig. Get the prisoners clear. There’s a chance of a hull breach.\nBARLOW: (VIA COM) Are we under attack?\nTRELLAK: Not exactly. Keep the Trooper with you. Don’t let the Doctor\nTRELLAK: and Miss Bush out of your sight.\nTRELLAK: I’m on my way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 36: INT.

It’s always the men with guns who get\nELKINAR: their way.\nMEL: (RUNNING) Sounds like someone’s hurt.\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) That tends to happen when the guns come out, Mel.\nELKINAR: (OFF) We’re here for the food! Don’t try to stop us!\nBARLOW: (STOPPING) I know that voice... Stay here you two. Don’t move. Trooper, with me. Ready your weapon. But hold your fire!\nBARLOW: (SHOUTING) All of you. Hold your fire! You men get back!\nBARLOW: (ROUNDING CORNER, GROAN OF RECOGNITION) Elkinar. I might have known it’d be you.\nTRELLAK: (ARRIVING) Lieutenant. Report. What’s happened here?\nBARLOW: Just got here myself, Ma’am.\nELKINAR: Your trigger-happy friends have shot one of my people, Barlow.\nTRELLAK: You know this person, Lieutenant?\nBARLOW: He worked with my father on the food programs. Thought he was too good for it though.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 66\nELKINAR: I decided it was time to do something practical.\nTRELLAK: Like raiding my ship? Some homecoming this is.\nBARLOW: I didn’t think yours would be the first familiar face I'd see, Elkinar. And definitely not before I reached solid ground.\nTRELLAK: Keep them covered. Stay where you are. The lot of you.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Look at them, Captain.\nMEL: They’re all so thin.\nBARLOW: I told you two to stay back!\nELKINAR: (CALLING) Looks like you keep your passengers well-fed too!\nTRELLAK: (CLOSE) Your assessment Teveler?\nBARLOW: We know they’re human at least. An Infinite Warrior wouldn’t even notice an injury.\nMEL: They can barely hold their weapons.\nDOCTOR: Look at their faces Captain. They’re scared. Desperate.\nTRELLAK: (ANNOYED) When I want the opinion of my prisoners, I’1l1 ask for it. Lieutenant. Take our guests to a more secure area.\nELKINAR: No witnesses. That’d suit you wouldn’t it, Captain?\nMEL: We’re not leaving. Not until we know what you’re going to do to these people.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 67\nTRELLAK: I haven’t spent ten years at war just so we could shoot the people we’ve been protecting.\nTRELLAK: (BEAT) Open up the supply hold. Let them take what they need.\nELKINAR: You heard her, soldiers. Give us what we came for.\nDOCTOR: An admirable gesture, Captain. But you can’t feed the whole planet.\nTRELLAK: Then I’11 do what I can. The war’s over, Doctor. We’ve already lost millions.\nBARLOW: Mel’s right. They can hardly carry those weapons, let alone fire them. Elkinar only got them up here through force of will.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s incredible what can be achieved through force of will...\nTRELLAK: (CALLING) You man. Elkinar, is it? Get your people back to your ship with the supplies.\nELKINAR: I don’t take orders from you.\nTRELLAK: Then think of it as a suggestion. Tell your pilot he’1ll have to undock that ship of yours if we’re all going to make planetfall in one piece.\nELKINAR: We’ll go when we’re ready. Look, there’s another store through here!\nTRELLAK: (CALLING OVER NOISE) Sergeant. Help them get the rations back to their vessel. Take the injured man to sickbay.\nTRELLAK: Teveler. Talk to your friend, will you? Get him to see sense.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 68\nBARLOW: Aye Captain. (SOTTO) Though sense was never his strong point.\nTRELLAK: And the prisoners... we’d better- (BREAKS OFF, BEAT) Where’ve\nTRELLAK: they gone?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 37: INT.

The colonists’ shuttle must be through here.\nMEL: (RUNNING) It’s chaos, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Then the least I can do is make sure we don’t end up in a shipwreck.\nMEL: At least they’ve got food now.\nDOCTOR: Much good it will do them... Oh, why can’t they see!\nMEL: What is it?\nDOCTOR: This is all part of its plan.\nMEL: What plan? You mean... the Eminence.\nDOCTOR: Let the human race think they’ve won.\nDOCTOR: Chamberlain got a lot of things wrong, but he was right about one thing. ‘In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners...’\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) With all your experience of wars, planetary and interplanetary, you humans really should know by now.\nMEL: Hang on, Doctor. It’s not my fault!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Mel. I don’t mean to take it out on you. It’s frustrating that they’re ignoring the obvious.\nMEL: Go on then. Enlighten me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 70\nDOCTOR: The Captain herself said as much. The Infinite Warriors have not been defeated. That wasn’t a retreat.\nMEL: What was it then? A... tactical withdrawal?\nDOCTOR: Look at what’s happening here, Mel. Deprivation. Starvation. This chaos is being replayed on hundreds of colony worlds.\nDOCTOR: It must be even worse where the Infinite Warriors had control.\nMEL: So...

After long years away, we finally see the boys and girls of the Alliance Fleet\nANNOUNCER: returning to the arms of their families.\nANNOUNCER: Grand Administrator Walter Vincent said we should all take a moment to remember those we have lost.\nANNOUNCER: Then tighten our belts. And get back to work. There will be some tough times ahead, but we are all in it together. And we should remember this above all else: the Eminence is defeated. Humanity has won.\nANNOUNCER: There are reports of jubilant crowds on Ridious IV taking a shuttle to greet the homecoming troops.\nANNOUNCER: In scenes repeated out across the systems, families are celebrating. We’ll be bringing you more pictures later.\nANNOUNCER: This is Alliance Update. All the news you need.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 40: INT. TRANSPORT VESSEL, BRIDGE\nBARLOW: Coming in to land, Captain. Delikur Spaceport, Ridious IV.\nBARLOW: (TO CREW) All right, people. Remember where you are.\nTRELLAK: Let them enjoy it, Lieutenant. God knows the next few years are going to be hard. Even Earth Admin admits that.\nTRELLAK: Your father’s been working on a way out of this, I believe?\nBARLOW: Seeing the state of the others, I... I just hope he’s still alive.\nBARLOW: (BEAT) I’m sorry, Captain... about the girl. And the Doctor. I’ve got men searching.\nTRELLAK: It couldn’t be helped... given the situation. If they’re not on board, they must be on that shuttle with our would-be hijackers.\nBARLOW: We've tracked its landing course. I’ve tried radioing ahead, but I can’t raise spaceport security.\nTRELLAK: Yes.. I’d noticed that. I’m beginning to think that in the great scheme of things, any threat the Doctor poses might be the least of our worries...\nBARLOW: I’m getting nothing on the secure channels to the Governor's office either.\nTRELLAK: (SOTTO) I didn’t tell you this, Teveler, but the word from fleet command is he’s gone to ground.\nBARLOW: You mean...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 74\nTRELLAK: People on the edge of starvation. Infrastructure gone. No authorities worth a damn. Far as I can see, Ridious IV is on the verge of collapse.\nTRELLAK: God help whoever ends up running it...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 41: INT. HIJACKED FLIER, FLIGHT DECK\nDOCTOR: There, down safely. The troop ship’s about five minutes behind.\nELKINAR: (CALLING TO CREW) Right, let’s get those containers stacked and ready to move out.\nMEL: You’re lucky the Doctor was here. If your landing skills are anything like your docking manoeuvres, we’d have been splattered across that car park over there.\nELKINAR: Thank you. ‘Doctor’, is it?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Elkinar.\nELKINAR: I’m a doctor too you know. Biochemistry and applied xeno- agronomy. Doctor Elkinar Dajan.\nMEL: Then you should have known better. You could have just waited till the Pequod landed, you know. There was no need to go storming aboard.\nELKINAR: I’m not a soldier. It just got to the point where... something had to be done.\nDOCTOR: But not necessarily this.\nDOCTOR: Captain Trellak is an honourable officer. She proved that by the way she handled the situation.\nMEL: Barlow is too. They’d have been happy to give you their supplies without you taking them.\nELKINAR: Barlow Teveler... Chalked up another member of his fan-club, I see. In my experience, you never know with Earth Alliance. Whether they’1l do what they say.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: (STANDING AND WALKING TO OTHER CREW) Right, you lot.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SHUTTLE DOORS OPENING, SYSTEMS SWITCHED OFF, ELKINAR’S CREW PASSING BY)\nELKINAR: Bring the supplies out. Keep the weapons handy. We might get rushed.\nELKINAR: (FX: MEL AND DOCTOR GOING DOWN METAL GANGPLANK INTO CHAOTIC SPACEPORT )\nMEL: So where are we now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ridious IV. A colony in the seventh system. And fortunately we’re at a spaceport. We need a ship fit for a much longer haul...\nELKINAR: Where are you headed?\nMEL: Our own transport’s back on Kalsos.\nELKINAR: Good luck with that. You won’t get anywhere near Kalsos without a military escort.\nELKINAR: (RUNNING OFF) Hey! You lot! Don’t let those crates out of your sight!\nMEL: What are you thinking Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That it’s bedlam here. And it’s only going to get worse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 42: EXT. DELIKUR SPACEPORT, EXIT RAMP\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: EXCITED CROWD, MILITARY TRANSPORT DOOR CLAMPS UNLOCKING, OFF)\nHELGERT: That damn fool Elkinar. He could have killed them all!\nSISRELLA: He never did think things through. Barlow’s ship’s down safe. That’s the main thing. Look. They’ve lowered the gangplank. The\nSISRELLA: soldiers are coming out!\nSISRELLA: (CROWD MORE EXCITED GREETING SOLDIERS, CALLS ‘Over here! Welcome back! Thank you!’ )\nHELGERT: Can you see him? Is he there?\nSISRELLA: (SEARCHING CROWD) No... Wait... (SPOTS HIM) Barlow! Barlow! Over\nSISRELLA: here!\nBARLOW: (CALLING, FAR OFF) Sis! Sis! Dad!?\nSISRELLA: Oh Barlow. We missed you! We missed you so much.\nBARLOW: It’s only been five years, Sis. You’ve grown!\nBARLOW: (MORE WARY) Dad... I-\nHELGERT: You did what you had to do. I know that now. I’m... proud of you son.\nHELGERT: (BEAT) Come here! Give your old dad a hug.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 43: EXT. DELIKUR SPACEPORT, NOT FAR OFF\nDOCTOR: Look Mel. There’s your friend Barlow.\nMEL: That must be his family... Oh, Doctor. That poor old man can hardly stand.\nDOCTOR: And the girl doesn’t look much stronger.\nDOCTOR: Look around, Mel. The people here. They’re even thinner than the ones who stormed the ship.\nDOCTOR: The whole colony must have been starving for months.\nMEL: We’re going to need help to get to a ship. And Barlow’s the only friendly face we know here.\nDOCTOR: We shouldn’t do anything to draw attention to ourselves...\nMEL: He listened to us before... (GOING OFF TOWARDS BARLOW’S FAMILY) If we explain properly. Everything you’ve worked out about the Eminence... he might be willing to help.\nDOCTOR: Mel! Wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 44: EXT. DELIKUR SPACEPORT, EXIT RAMP (CONTINUOUS)\nMEL: (CALLING) Barlow.\nBARLOW: Mel? And the Doctor. So. You didn’t run very far then.\nMEL: We’ve got nothing to run away from.\nBARLOW: Still looking to get back to Kalsos are you?\nDOCTOR: Very much so.\nHELGERT: (COMING UP) Who are these people?\nMEL: I’m Mel, and this is--\nDOCTOR: --the Doctor. Thank you, Mel.\nBARLOW: This is my father, Professor Helgert Teveler, And my sister Sisrella.\nSISRELLA: (ARRIVING) Hi. Were you with my brother on the Pequod? You don’t look like soldiers.\nDOCTOR: That’s because we’re not.\nMEL: No. We're... civilians. Barlow saved us when the Kalsos Tower collapsed.\nSISRELLA: Kalsos Tower? We watched it on the vid. You mean you were in there when it-\nBARLOW: Sis. Take this credit stick, And my I.D. Go get us a transrider from the park. I'll take us home in style.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 80\nSISRELLA: The perks of the military! (GOING OFF) OK. I’1ll have them send it to the gates.\nDOCTOR: Barlow... we owe you our lives.\nBARLOW: (CONSIDERING) By rights, I should hand you two straight over to the authorities.\nHELGERT: (SNORTS) You’1ll be lucky if you can find them. The Ridious Governor holed himself up in his bunker eighteen months ago. No-one’s seen hide nor hair of him since.\nMEL: And in the meantime, it looks like mob-rule’s taken over...\nHELGERT: Are these people... dangerous, Barlow?\nBARLOW: (CONSIDERING AND MAKING A DECISION) No. (BEAT) No, I don’t think they are.\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) An army marches on its stomach, Boney used to say. But the people left behind need to eat too...\nHELGERT: I beg your pardon?\nMEL: Well. Whatever the problem here, the Doctor can help. I promise!\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Mel...\nMEL: And if we do something for you. Perhaps you can help in return.\nHELGERT: I’d like to know how you can help, Doctor. You can’t make the seeds grow from nothing and the rains fall?\nMEL: You'd be surprised...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 81\nDOCTOR: Melanie, please...\nMEL: Come on Doctor. We’ve got to at least try.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 45: EXT. ROAD FROM DELIKUR SPACEPORT, ON TRANSRIDER\nCARRIAGE: (FX: WHEELS OF TRANSRIDER, SNORTING HELTICORE, CROWD NOISES PASSING OPEN CARRIAGE)\nBARLOW: (CALLING FROM DRIVER'S SEAT) All aboard who’s coming aboard!\nMEL: (CLIMBING ONTO CARRIAGE) What is that creature pulling this thing? Looks someone crossed a camel with an elephant!\nDOCTOR: The helticore? Native to Ridious, I believe. After you, Sisrella, Professor.\nMEL: Have you driven one of these before, Barlow?\nBARLOW: (CALLING FROM DRIVER'S SEAT) I grew up with them! Didn’t used to be so expensive to hire one though... Off we go! Yah!\nSISRELLA: We get the helticores to do all the long hauls now. Been in demand ever since the fuel crisis started.\nDOCTOR: Let me guess, the helticores hardly need feeding and your biofuel crops have failed as well?\nHELGERT: Everything has, Doctor. Nothing’s grown on Ridious — nor any of the other colonies we’ve been in contact with — for the last three years, at least.\nSISRELLA: It’s the same across the ten systems. If they haven’t exhausted their stockpiles yet, they soon will.\nMEL: All those people... heading into the city. Some of them can barely walk.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 83\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) What was that?\nSISRELLA: They think they’re going to find more supplies here.\nHELGERT: All they’1l find is more overcrowding and fighting over what\nHELGERT: there is. And that fool Elkinar doesn’t help.\nSISRELLA: He means well, Dad.\nHELGERT: So you keep saying.\nDOCTOR: No... it can’t be...\nINFINITE WARRIOR: (FX: ECHOING WHISPER) Here.\nDOCTOR: There it is again.\nMEL: What is it Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s following us...\nBARLOW: All OK back there?\nMEL: A bit bumpy but we’1l live!\nDOCTOR: Stop! Stop the carriage! (BEAT) There! It’s there!\nINFINITE WARRIOR: (FX: HISSING, LOUDER) Here. He is here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 84\nMEL: (FX: FUZZY, FADING IN) Doctor? Are you all right?\nMEL: (NORMAL) Doctor, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (HORRIFIED) It’s looking straight at us...\nDOCTOR: (TO OTHERS) Mel... Sisrella.. Can’t you see it?\nMEL: See what? You just... zoned out for a second.\nDOCTOR: Over there. A hooded figure.\nSISRELLA: Everyone’s got hoods. The wind’s getting up and the dust gets everywhere.\nDOCTOR: No. It was... a dark... hideous thing. Its eyes... burning orange...\nBARLOW: There’s nothing there Doctor. I’ve seen an Infinite Warrior up close. They make their presence felt.\nDOCTOR: That’s just it. I felt a... presence.\nMEL: Doctor, are you sure?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPPING) Of course I’m sure, Mel. I’m not prone to making things up.\nMEL: All right. Don’t bite my head off. It’s just, if no-one else can see it...\nDOCTOR: (TROUBLED) Just... let’s get on, shall we? Professor, tell me about your research.\nDOCTOR: [UNDER FOLLOWING ]\nDOCTOR: When did the blight start?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 85\nHELGERT: Well. The first crops failed along the western coasts. Then it spread... Before we knew it, there was a total, planet-wide blight. We had stocks for a few years, but things got worse...]\nHELGERT: [OVER PRECEDING]\nSISRELLA: (CLOSE, TO MEL) Does he do this often, your ‘Doctor’? Have visions, I mean?\nMEL: (CLOSE) Frankly... no. And I’m starting to worry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 46: EXT.

TEVELER HOUSE\nHELGERT: Welcome Doctor. To our humble abode.\nDOCTOR: There’s something you don’t see too much in this century. Books!\nHELGERT: I’ve copies of the research from every major agronomist for the last two hundred years. Bound and indexed.\nDOCTOR: All the experts in the field. As it were.\nHELGERT: I’ve taken on everything I could from the work of Delinger, Traymer, Lasky...\nDOCTOR: Lasky? I don’t think we want to go too far down that route...\nHELGERT: (CALLING OUTSIDE) Leave your kitbag in the carriage, Barlow. We'll take the Transrider straight on to the Facility.\nSISRELLA: (COMING IN WITH MEL) Dad. Barlow’s just got back. Besides. You’re worn out. You need to rest. Mel and the Doctor-\nHELGERT: (INTERRUPTING) No. If the Doctor can help-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) I’m not promising anything just yet, Helgert.\nHELGERT: If the Doctor can be of any assistance at all, the sooner we get there, the better.\nMEL: I think you should listen, Professor. It might be best if you rested up here. Sisrella and Barlow can take us to your research lab.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 88\nHELGERT: No. It’s close by. I’ve come this far. I’1ll be damned if I let someone else take the last few steps.\nHELGERT: (GOING OFF) Come along Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Coming, Professor.\nHELGERT: (OFF) Barlow. Don’t let it sit down, we’ll never get it up again!\nHELGERT: (CALLING, OFF) Sisrella, bring my notes!\nMEL: He’s stubborn, your dad.\nSISRELLA: Now you know where Barlow gets it from.\nSISRELLA: Come on then, Mel. Give me a hand.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 48: EXT. CROP FACILITY\nHELGERT: You see Doctor. Every seedling, every root. It sprouts, then withers.\nHELGERT: If I could just get one single specimen to survive, I could replicate it a thousand times over in hours!\nDOCTOR: Yes... I’m sure you’ve.. done your best.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s clear what’s happened.\nMEL: Which is what?\nDOCTOR: Here, Mel. Take a look through the microscope.\nMEL: What am I looking for?\nDOCTOR: Look at the markers. The Professor’s highlighted the genetic abnormality.\nMEL: And these samples are all from different places?\nHELGERT: Yes. The same traces on Ridious II, Trellor V, the Sansert cluster... It’s like the disease broke out across the systems instantaneously.\nDOCTOR: Or rather, was introduced.\nMEL: Biological warfare?\nHELGERT: I was thinking along much the same lines...\nDOCTOR: Somehow, the Eminence has disseminated a bio-agent across the ecosystem here, and on every other supply world.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 90\nHELGERT: The Infinite Warriors never got a foothold here. They came close, but their ships were destroyed in orbit.\nDOCTOR: Don’t tell me. Their vessel exploded? In the atmosphere?\nHELGERT: Yes... (REALISING) Oh no. It was deliberate.\nDOCTOR: As I said. A biological weapon.\nDOCTOR: It must have happened across dozens of worlds. Hundreds even.\nHELGERT: But we cleaned the soil. Sisrella set up whole new irrigation systems. We start afresh every time.\nDOCTOR: But the bio-agent acted on the seeds themselves. Mutating them.\nHELGERT: So no matter how hard I tried. These seeds were never going to grow.\nMEL: It sounds like you need something from before the War started.\nHELGERT: But we’ve got nothing in storage here. All the viable flora on the colonies was active. We should have put something to one Side...\nMEL: ‘They took all the trees. And put them in a tree museum.’\nHELGERT: What was that? (BEAT) You, young lady, are a genius!\nMEL: Really? Not me. Joni Mitchell!\nHELGERT: Well. We don’t have tree museums. But we do have banks.\nDOCTOR: Of course! Seedbanks. Stores of all the vital reserves. A genetic backup.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 91\nHELGERT: Kept on Earth. In case of disaster. Natural or otherwise. I think this counts, wouldn’t you agree?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. It was after your time, Mel, but a global seed bank was established in West Sussex in the early 215+ century. It became a depository of all the world’s main cereal crops, among other things. To maintain the planet’s biodiversity.\nDOCTOR: In this century it would be situated somewhere in the equatorial Administration Zones.\nHELGERT: You’re right. I’ve been there! The Agricultural Antiquities Reliquaries!\nMEL: I beg your pardon?\nHELGERT: We had a tour. There’s a dedicated disaster recovery vault. Seeds with the base genes for fast-growing food crops.\nHELGERT: If I had them, I could use my equipment to splice them, replicate them. From a few dozen seeds we could make thousands!\nDOCTOR: So if we could get to Earth, Professor... To these Reliquaries...\nDOCTOR: You could point us in the direction of this vault?\nHELGERT: Better than that, I can print you off a map!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 49: EXT. CROP FACILITY FIELD\nBARLOW: Dad... He doesn’t look well.\nSISRELLA: No. It’s been hard. The last year especially. We’d kept out of the city till now.\nSISRELLA: Rationing. Riots. Delkinur’s a no go area.\nBARLOW: You shouldn’t have risked it.. Coming to meet me...\nSISRELLA: Oh, the military were going to be there... what could go wrong?\nBARLOW: Ha! See how that worked out. She’s a good sort, Trellak. But I think she just fed the chaos, giving away our supplies.\nSISRELLA: At least she fed the people in the process. For a few more weeks anyway.\nBARLOW: Dad seems OK with it now. My going away...\nSISRELLA: It took a while. But yeah. He knows you had to. (BEAT) He’1l be telling you his stories about getting drunk on Earth again soon enough!\nBARLOW: You’ve been hearing that one again have you?\nSISRELLA: (SMILING) Just a few times... Yeah. (SERIOUS) He forgets... It’s the malnutrition. The memory’s the first to go.\nBARLOW: He seems sharp enough now.\nSISRELLA: Yes, this Doctor’s given him hope. I hope he keeps his promises.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 93\nBARLOW: It’s Mel who’s done all the promising.\nSISRELLA: (TAKING THE MICKEY) Oh yes... Your damsel in distress. She seems... nice.\nBARLOW: Don’t start, Sis. (BEAT, POINTED) Elkinar doesn’t change.\nSISRELLA: Look. Elkinar was a long time ago. He had all these plans...\nBARLOW: Maybe when he grows up, he’1l be able to deliver what--\nSISRELLA: -- Anyway. My little brother the war hero has the pick of the girls now he’s home!\nBARLOW: Hero? The most useful thing I did was stay alive for five years.\nSISRELLA: Come off it. We all heard about Earth Alliance at Ventos. Forcing them back through the Wendron Spiral... The great victory.\nBARLOW: It wasn’t like that. (BEAT) The Infinite Warriors... they just gave up. Left their slave armies as cannon fodder.\nSISRELLA: You said something about that before... But they said Ventos was the turning point. When they knew they were beaten.\nBARLOW: No. We hardly engaged. Just ended up following them back. All the way to Kalsos.\nSISRELLA: Alliance Update ran features for weeks. You even got a profile.\nBARLOW: Don’t believe everything you see on the news...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB\nSISRELLA: Barlow...\nBARLOW: Yes, Sis?\nSISRELLA: What’s that noise?\nCROSS BACK TO: Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 50: INT.

Fifty miles from Docking Blue Zone. Port 331. You can take the shuttle. Be there in ten minutes.\nMEL: That’s where Morocco used to be...\nDOCTOR: (STARTING TO BECOME A LITTLE DISTANT) Yes. These areas are all given over to the Earth Administration leaders now.\nHELGERT: Good climates. Beach houses. Lots of resources for not many people.\nHELGERT: It’s obscene. I went there thirty-odd years ago. Visited the agricultural facilities, but we weren’t allowed near the Admin Zones. (TO SELF) I wonder if Kenneth’s still there...\nMEL: But after all this time.. Would they really still be any use?\nHELGERT: Seeds remain viable for thousands of years, young lady... Besides it’s a state of the art storage facility. They don’t even have to replant. It’s all in sub-zero cryogenic suspension.\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST TO SELF) And most importantly. Those supplies would pre-date the War.\nMEL: Professor, did the Infinite Warriors ever get anywhere near Earth?\nMEL: (FX: HUM OF FALLING SPACECRAFT OUTSIDE, FAINT, BUILDING THROUGH )\nHELGERT: No. The fighting began in the outer colonies. They were moving through the ten systems towards it... But now they’ve been stopped...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 96\nDOCTOR: (DISTANT) If only we had some way of getting to Earth.\nMEL: Can we request a ship from the Ridious authorities?\nHELGERT: Trouble is, there are no authorities. The Empire’s been stretched to breaking point. We all have.\nMEL: So.. Any ideas on how we’re going to get there, Doctor? If only we had the TARDIS...\nHELGERT: Here. You’1ll need these too. Access codes to release the seeds. All the super-maizes, rice variants, the base food crops,\nHELGERT: they’re all listed there. Enough to get us started again.\nMEL: Going back to your roots...\nHELGERT: Oh... Very good, Miss Bush. I must say all this excitement has\nHELGERT: made me quite light-headed.\nMEL: You'd better sit down Professor. (HELPS HIM) So... Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Hmm?\nMEL: What next? (BEAT) What is that noise?\nSISRELLA: (RUSHING IN) There’s a ship... It’s coming down outside!\nBARLOW: (RUSHING IN) Get under cover! Everyone - get down!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 51: INT. TRANSPORTER\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING INTO SHIP) I was right. The damage is superficial.\nBARLOW: (CLIMBING IN) That was almost a landing, not a crash.\nDOCTOR: Barlow. Take a look at the flight log. I’1ll examine these... bodies.\nBARLOW: It says there were three crewmen.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Here they are. All dead.\nBARLOW: So no-one was flying it?\nBARLOW: The log says they just left Delikur spaceport. Long-range transporter on its way to a pick-up on Ridious III. Heading for the home system.\nDOCTOR: Yes. There’s a bank of cryogenic suspension pods. All primed\nDOCTOR: and ready for use...\nBARLOW: There’s nothing after that. No reason for a crash.\nDOCTOR: I can feel... something.\nBARLOW: Look. They put the force-fields on. Maximum strength.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) A shock. A cry of pain. Dying in agony...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 98\nBARLOW: Doctor... What is it?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure...\nDOCTOR: Let me see the medi-system.. The crew’s vital signs. Look. They disappear off the trace twenty minutes ago. Pulse... Respiration... just... shut down...\nDOCTOR: (FX: ADJUSTING CONTROLS) Let’s see... Brain activity... (BEAT) Oh no.\nBARLOW: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Their minds have been burned out. Destroyed. Some incredibly powerful psychic shock...\nBARLOW: (WALKING AROUND FLIGHT DECK) Well. You wanted a ship to get us\nBARLOW: to Earth. This is a long haul vessel.\nBARLOW: Like you said. Suspension pods. Plenty of fuel. This ion drive should get us there in just over two months.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. It is very... convenient...\nSISRELLA: (DESPERATE SHOUTS, OUTSIDE) Barlow! Barlow!\nBARLOW: (RACING OUT OF SHIP) Sisrella! What’s wrong?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 52: INT. CROP FACILITY LAB\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND BARLOW CARRYING HELGERT’S BODY, PUTTING HIM ON LAB BENCH)\nBARLOW: Get him on the table. Quickly, Doctor.\nSISRELLA: (FOLLOWING) Dad! Dad! What’s happened to him?\nMEL: No sign of a pulse.\nSISRELLA: He was trying to get to the ship... he just keeled over.\nMEL: He’s stopped breathing, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’ll try to restart his heart...\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR STARTS COMPRESSIONS, 100 BEATS/MIN FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS UNDER FOLLOWING)\nDOCTOR: (DOING COMPRESSIONS) Barlow. Mouth-to-mouth when I say...\nSISRELLA: Please... Please help him.\nMEL: If anyone can help, the Doctor can.\nDOCTOR: (STILL COMPRESSING, ANNOYED) Mel, please. Stop making promises on my behale...\nMEL: I- I’m sorry.\nBARLOW: Come on... Come on...\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Now! Two short breaths.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 100\nSISRELLA: Please... Dad?\nBARLOW: Any good?\nDOCTOR: No... Let me try again.\nSISRELLA: Oh God... no...\nBARLOW: He’s so thin... So cold.. His skin’s like paper...\nMEL: Doctor... I don’t think...\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Yes. Yes. You’re right...\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING BACK) I’m sorry. I’m so very sorry.\nBARLOW: Should I.. Should I try another breath?\nDOCTOR: Barlow.. I think we can stop.\nSISRELLA: (DISTRAUGHT) No!\nMEL: His pulse is gone. It never came back...\nBARLOW: You did what you could. Mel. Doctor. Thank you.\nBARLOW: He was just so weak... It’s too late, Sis.\nSISRELLA: We shouldn’t have moved him... We shouldn’t...\nDOCTOR: His heart couldn’t take the strain any more. The shock of the crash. The malnutrition took its toll...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB\nSISRELLA: I tried to give him my rations... when he realised. I should have\nMEL: It’s not your fault, Sisrella.\nBARLOW: No. It’s this... this damn war.\nDOCTOR: Page 101\nDOCTOR: but he always gave them back done more...\nDOCTOR: Yes... One more victim of the Eminence.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 53: EXT. CROP FACILITY FIELD\nBARLOW: Goodbye, Dad.\nSISRELLA: Goodbye. (WHISPER) Love you.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. Your father was a brilliant man. Given time... his genetic modifications... they could have worked. But it would have taken years.\nSISRELLA: (SOMBRE) And we don’t have that time, do we?\nDOCTOR: We need to get the seed samples from Earth. The replication equipment here could be used to supply the other colonies.\nDOCTOR: With your father’s accelerated growth program and your own irrigation systems, Sisrella, you could have crops in less than a year.\nBARLOW: Even allowing for the return trip to Earth?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The soil’s prepared. You’d be ready to start as soon as we’re back.\nMEL: But aren’t we going to Kalsos?\nDOCTOR: No, Mel. Earth. I think we owe these people a fighting chance. The seedbanks on Earth will give them that.\nSISRELLA: Barlow and I have talked about it.. We’re coming with you.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that’s-\nBARLOW: No argument. Believe me, I tried.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 103\nSISRELLA: It’s that or die slowly of starvation here. (BEAT) I want to carry on Dad’s work. We need to get those seeds.\nBARLOW: Besides. Look. Over there, on the horizon.\nMEL: Transriders. More of those helticores. There are people coming here!\nBARLOW: They must have seen where the transporter came down.\nMEL: They probably think there are supplies on board...\nSISRELLA: Or they might just want to get off-world.\nBARLOW: Either way — we don’t want to be here when they arrive.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got your father’s map. Let’s put it to good use.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 54: INT. TRANSPORTER\nMEL: So. We just fall asleep in these things, and wake up on earth.\nDOCTOR: (PREOCCUPIED, CHECKING SYSTEMS) It’s not exactly sleep...\nBARLOW: You won’t know a thing about it. You don’t even dream in suspended animation. All metabolic functions, suspended.\nMEL: But is it safe?\nSISRELLA: Don’t worry Mel. I’ve done it before. Had a year of my engineering course on Mandalay 9. Six weeks there, six weeks back.\nDOCTOR: (STILL PREOCCUPIED) Yes. It all seems in order. Almost as if it were meant for us...\nMEL: Doctor, you don’t sound sure whether it’s a gift-horse or a Trojan horse.\nDOCTOR: It will get us to Earth. Safely. That’s the main thing.\nBARLOW: In two months one week and two days.\nMEL: Why can’t we just stay awake?\nBARLOW: Keeping the crew in deep-freeze preserves life support functions. And we won’t need to eat the non-existent food.\nSISRELLA: (GETTING INTO POD) Watch. Climb in. Lie down. The pod does the rest.\nBARLOW: Don’t worry Mel. It’s perfectly safe. I’ve checked it over five times myself.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 105\nDOCTOR: And I, another five.\nBARLOW: See? (SETTING POD CONTROLS) Ready, Sis?\nSISRELLA: Ready.\nBARLOW: OK. See you on Earth.\nDOCTOR: You next, Lieutenant?\nBARLOW: (GETTING INTO POD) OK. Send me under. Good night, Doctor. Good night, Mel.\nDOCTOR: There. Your turn, Mel.\nMEL: (GETTING INTO POD) This mattress is a bit hard.\nDOCTOR: You won’t feel a thing once you’re under.\nMEL: What about you?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. I’ve my own means of suspending my metabolism.\nMEL: Doctor... Are you... all right?\nDOCTOR: All right?\nMEL: Ever since we got to Ridious... You’ve been a bit... odd.\nDOCTOR: Have I?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 106\nMEL: See. No joke. No witty retort. You’re not even smiling.\nMEL: It’s just not you.\nDOCTOR: Mel. I have very little to smile about. Until we’re through EhUSs.. Tec\nMEL: I’m sorry. You’ve a lot on your mind. (BEAT) You do know... If you ever need to talk...\nDOCTOR: I know where you are. Sleep well, all of you. See you on Earth.\nDOCTOR: (RELIEVED) Alone. At last. (BEAT) Aaaahh! (FIGHTING IT) You’re here... aren’t you?\nEMINENCE: You are never alone, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No...\nEMINENCE: We have been with you every step of the way.\nDOCTOR: I know...\nEMINENCE: Guiding... influencing. Ensuring you carry out our will.\nDOCTOR: The will... of the Eminence...\nEMINENCE: You have done well, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I... am... your... servant...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB\nEMINENCE: You will carry out our plans. Doctor.\nEMINENCE: You have taken the Breath of Life. We have shared in your mind. You share Once you have joined with the Eminence\nEMINENCE: Forever!\nEMINENCE: END OF PART THREE\nEMINENCE: Page 107\nEMINENCE: in our destiny.\nEMINENCE: .. you are ours.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 108"

You mean you... You were under its control? It was in your mind?\nDOCTOR: I.. was possessed by the Eminence. Once. A long time ago.\nMEL: What... what happened?\nDOCTOR: It was several lifetimes ago... Er... I’d... rather not talk about it. Let’s just say... that’s a story for another day.\nMEL: Okay, but that mist that came out of the casket thing... ? Was it... alive? A sort of psychic force?\nDOCTOR: I still don’t know for sure what it is... But I know what it wants. (BEAT) All of humanity — enslaved to its will.\nDOCTOR: I thought it had gone... but it left a taint in my mind. A connection. A link it could exploit.\nMEL: But you resisted? It couldn’t take you over?\nDOCTOR: For a time... even I was.. subsumed, Mel.\nDOCTOR: In the end, I used the suspension pod to regain control. To fool it into thinking I was still under when I was actually up and about...\nMEL: And reprogramming this robot... I knew something was wrong. You'd been fighting it all that time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 132\nDOCTOR: You know me, Mel. A will of iron. Though for a while... I was carrying out its wishes without even knowing.\nMEL: So.. it wanted you to get to the seedbank.\nDOCTOR: In order to send a casket. To contaminate Earth’s supplies. Rebuild its army. Restart the war.\nMEL: But you used the link against it, in the end?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I turned its power back on itself. And its Infinite Warrior has found the seedbank empty. The Eminence’s plans go back to square one.\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) I do hope Kenneth keeps his head down...\nMEL: But Doctor...

It’s more than I deserve.\nMEL: There is one thing Doctor. I get the Carrot Juice bit. But what about the double-0 Six?\nDOCTOR: I am in my sixth incarnation.

They must have been in that explosion...\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nMEL: That poor family. After all they’d been through... For it to end like that...\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute. Only Barlow followed me...

Even against the Eminence...\nMEL: Should we wake her?\nDOCTOR: No. Let her sleep. You should too.\nMEL: Yes... I suppose we have to get back...\nDOCTOR: If we can find Captain Trellak back on Ridious IV, I think those seeds will buy us safe passage to Kalsos.\nMEL: To the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Mel. To the TARDIS. (BEAT) Now. I need to run the pre- flight checks. It’s time for you to rest.\nMEL: It’s been so horrible... Horrible... Are we safe now? Truly safe?\nDOCTOR: I’1ll be here. I shan’t let you out of my sight for a second.\nMEL: But... The Eminence?\nDOCTOR: It’s gone. Don’t worry. I am fully in control of my self...\nMEL: Doctor... Would it be wrong to ask..? (CHANGING HER MIND) No. No, I can’t.\nDOCTOR: (GENTLY) What is it Mel?\nMEL: I was going to ask if I could sleep all the way to Kalsos. To wake up in the TARDIS...\nDOCTOR: Of course. I wouldn’t blame you if you did. The human will is strong. But it does have its limits.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SEEDS OF WAR (002) NB Page 142\nMEL: No... I need to be there for Sisrella.

Professor Helgert Teveler’s research facility, now run by his daughter, is the base of operations for the project. They’1ll be shipping off-world within days.\nANNOUNCER: Earth Administration says increased colony tariffs are simply a reflection of new distribution costs. ‘For a fresh lease of life, it’s a bargain in anyone’s money,’ Grand Administrator Vincent said today.\nANNOUNCER: Meanwhile, the minor explosion at the edge of Earth Blue Zone has been explained by the authorities. An unused storage facility, scheduled for closure six months ago, was demolished according to plan. A lack of media notification is blamed on an ‘administrative oversight’.\nANNOUNCER: And finally, any rumours of Infinite Warrior sightings across the ten systems are just that, says Vincent.\nANNOUNCER: Earth has led humanity to victory.
