(AS THEY APPROACH THE GLASS) Great view, though!\nDOCTOR: Each of those domes is a Hub. The atmosphere here is thin and quite toxic, so they’re connected by a network of underground tunnels.\nTEGAN: Which dome are Adric and Nyssa going to?\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: That one, I think. On the very edge.\nTEGAN: That’s the biggest of the lot.\nTEGAN: Page 17\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 18\nALERT: BEEPS SUBTLY.\nKALA: What’s that?\nFELL: An entry alarm. Unauthorised personnel on the viewing deck. Honestly, you’d think we sounded that siren for fun. (HEADS FOR EXIT) I’1ll take a couple of Custodians and check it out.\nFELL: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 19\nTEGAN: WANDERS ACROSS THE FLOOR.\nTEGAN: Hey, look out there! What a spaceship!\nTEGAN: THE DOCTOR JOINS HER.\nDOCTOR: Impressive indeed. It’s taking up the entire spaceport.\nTEGAN: It’s huge!\nDOCTOR: It’s an advanced design. It even has... (STOPS HIMSELF) Oh dear.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: I think I may have miscalculated...\nTEGAN: You mean it’s closer than it looks and actually really tiny.\nDOCTOR: No... (LOOKING AROUND) What I need is.. Ah, yes. An information terminal.\nDOCTOR: HE HURRIES TO THE TERMINAL.\nTEGAN: What’s wrong?\nDOCTOR: That ship is fitted with a very special propulsion system. The engine ducts give it away. It’s a Leap Drive.\nTEGAN: What’s a ‘Leap Drive’?\nDOCTOR: One that can move a ship across vast distances in an instant. It’s the first truly intergalactic drive system. It’s what allows humanity to leave the Milky Way. Now... here we are.\nDOCTOR: HE TAPS A KEY.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 20\nAUTUMN: (DISTORT, PRESENTING) Ladies and gentlemen, humans and visiting others. — Welcome to Gallius Ultima. The launch platform for\nAUTUMN: the greatest feat in the history of space exploration. Travel beyond our galaxy.\nAUTUMN: A MUSICAL FLOURISH.\nTEGAN: I thought you said we were a long time before that?\nDOCTOR: (EMBARRASSED) As I said, a miscalculation. Only by a hundred years or so.\nDOCTOR: IN B/G, COMPUTER SHOWS THE LAUNCH OF THE KEPLER.\nAUTUMN: (D) One month ago, the Explorer-class ship Johannes Kepler left Gallius U, en route to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its crew charged with an historic mission.\nFURTHER: MUSICAL FLOURISH.\nDOCTOR: That confirms it. This is a crucial time for humanity’s development. I try to avoid these.\nELEVATOR: OPENS BEHIND...\nDOCTOR: We should go.\nFELL: EXITS ELEVATOR, WITH TWO CUSTODIANS.\nFELL: You’11l go alright. With us. — Custodians: cover them!\nCUSTODIANS: RAISE THEIR GUNS.\nTEGAN: Oh well done, Doctor.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 21\nMONORAIL: POD GLIDES IN AND HALTS. CANOPY OPENS. AUTUMN, ADRIC AND NYSSA GET OUT.\nNYSSA: That was fast.\nADRIC: (SHAKEN) It was... wasn’t it?\nAUTUMN: This way.\nSHE: HURRIES UP A RAMP. ADRIC AND NYSSA FOLLOW, INTO:\nLARGE: ROOM. INSTRUMENTS TICKING OVER. AUTUMN, ADRIC AND NYSSA ENTER.\nAUTUMN: Well, here it is. The Astronomy Hub.\nNYSSA: It’s very quiet.\nADRIC: Where is everyone?\nAUTUMN: (APPROACHING AN INSTRUMENT PANEL) It’s almost completely automated. — One moment, please.\nSHE: PRESSES A SWITCH. COMMS CHANNEL OPENS.\nAUTUMN: (INTO MIC) Astronomy to Control.\nKALA: (DISTORT) Go ahead, Autumn.\nAUTUMN: I’ve arrived, mother. Can you feed the Kepler's telemetry through to me?\nKALA: (D) It’s being done.\nDATA: BEEPS ACROSS A SCREEN.\nDATA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 22\nAUTUMN: I’ve got it. Realigning now. Keep watching your screens. Astronomy out.\nCOMMS: CHANNEL CLOSED. AUTUMN OPERATES FURTHER CONTROLS.\nADRIC: What are you doing? What’s the Kepler?\nAUTUMN: Where have you been? The Johannes Kepler.\nNYSSA: We’re new to... here.\nAUTUMN: You must be new to life. The Kepler left for the Large Magellanic Cloud a month ago.\nADRIC: A month ago? (TO NYSSA, SOTTO) But the Doctor said...\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) He must have miscalculated.\nAUTUMN: We lost contact. We were prepping the Carl Sagan for a rescue mission. But a few hours ago — sorry, could you step away from those canisters?\nADRIC: (STEPPING AWAY) Sorry. What’s in them?\nAUTUMN: Liquid nitrogen. For the probe launches. — So yes, a few hours ago the Kepler turned up on the detectors.\nNYSSA: That’s good, isn’t it?\nAUTUMN: Of course. But we’ve not been able to make contact with them. So I’m realigning our orbital telescope to get a look at the ship. And... (MORE BUTTONS) I’m nearly there.\nAUTUMN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nDOOR: OPENS. THE DOCTOR AND TEGAN ARE\nTEGAN: (ENTERING) Hey! Quit shoving!\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Calm, Tegan.\nKALA: Who are these two?\nFELL: Found them on the Viewing Deck.\nPUSHED: IN.\nPUSHED: Page 23\nPUSHED: I don’t have time to deal with unauthorised tourists! Put\nPUSHED: in the detention hub.\nTEGAN: Now hang on a minute...\nTEGAN: STATIC FROM MAIN SCREEN AS IMAGE RESOLVES.\nOPERATOR: Controller! We’re getting an image on the main screen.\nKALA: The Kepler. At last.\nSTATIC: FADES.\nFELL: Good Gods.\nKALA: What’s happened to them?\nKALA: them\nFELL: MOVES TO A COMPUTER SCREEN & BEGINS TAPPING. BEEP BEEP.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) That looks like the ship we saw on the information\nTEGAN: terminal.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Or parts of it. It’s badly damaged.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: THE COMPUTER SCREEN DISPLAYS THE READOUT ASSESSMENT ON THE KEPLER.\nFELL: They’ve lost the cargo section, and at least two explorer modules. There’s damage all along the starboard side.\nKALA: What could have done this?\nFELL: There are strong stellar winds in the L.M.C.\nDOCTOR: Stellar winds didn’t do that.\nFELL: Custodians — take these “tourists” away.\nDOCTOR: Please! That damage was deliberate!\nKALA: Wait.\nSHE: APPROACHES THE DOCTOR.\nKALA: What do you know about what’s happened to our ship?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen the effect of stellar winds. That isn’t it. Your has come under attack.\nKALA: From whom?\nDOCTOR: Well now. That’s the question.\nDOCTOR: ship\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 25\nAUTUMN: TAPS CONTROLS.\nAUTUMN: Beginning a thermographic and spectrographic sweep of the Kepler...\nSCAN: BEGINS.\nAUTUMN: I’m Autumn, by the way. Autumn Tace. Who are you?\nADRIC: Adric.\nNYSSA: Nyssa. Are you in charge here? You’re very young.\nAUTUMN: I’m the director of Astronomy. My mother is the base Controller.\nADRIC: That lady we heard.\nAUTUMN: I worked for my position. As it happens, I’m a prodigy!\nSUBTLE: ALARM ON AN INSTRUMENT PANEL.\nAUTUMN: The scan’s finished.\nSHE: PRESSES BUTTONS.\nAUTUMN: That’s odd. That’s very... Oh.\nNYSSA: What?\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 26\nNYSSA: THE DOCTOR IS OPERATING A COMPUTER SCREEN, ENLARGING VARIOUS SECTIONS ON A SCHEMATIC OF THE KEPLER.\nDOCTOR: Look. There’s explosive damage at key points, including the Leap Drive - see here? (A BEEP) - exactly where the tharian\nDOCTOR: power cells are fitted.\nKALA: How do you know about the Leap Drive? That’s classified.\nDOCTOR: I know everything there is to know about Leap Drives. More to the point, so did whoever attacked the Johannes Kepler - this damage was targeted. Not stellar winds.\nFELL: But if it’s deliberate, that means there’s a hostile force within the L.M.C.\nDOCTOR: Very probably.\nCOMMUNICATIONS: CHANNEL PINGS OPEN.\nAUTUMN: (DISTORT) Astronomy to Control.\nKALA: Autumn. What is it?\nAUTUMN: (D) Mother, I just completed a scan of the ship. It shows a spike in the engine core.\nKALA: What?\nKALA: A SUDDEN BEEP BEEP FROM THE DOCTOR'S TERMINAL.\nDOCTOR: She’s right. They’ve just fired up their ion drive.\nAUTUMN: (D) I don’t see how. The thermograph also shows no life signs anywhere on the Kepler. I’ve swept the ship from bow to stern. There’‘s nobody aboard.\nTEGAN: But someone must be flying it.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR: Unless it’s been pre-programmed.\nINSTRUMENT: ALARM. THE TERMINAL BRINGS UP THE FLIGHT PATH.\nFELL: Telemetry shows the Kepler is accelerating. Speed at one-eighth luminal and climbing. Her engines are at critical tolerance.\nDOCTOR: Looks like the Kepler is on a return course to this planet. Presumably to its point of origin — this base.\nKALA: What’s your point?\nOPERATOR: Speed one-quarter luminal and climbing.\nDOCTOR: Their speed is increasing exponentially. They don’t intend to slow down.\nTEGAN: But if they don’t slow down... they’1l crash.\nKALA: General — confirm the Kepler's destination!\nFELL: FRANTICALLY TAPS AWAY AT THE COMPUTER.\nFELL: Predicted landing point is... this base.\nKALA: Stranger. Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Introductions later. What matters is that whoever attacked your ship is now using it as a weapon against you!\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 28\nAUTUMN: TAPS KEYS. DATA READ-OUT.\nAUTUMN: Yes. On its current trajectory, the Kepler will land on top of us. Travelling at almost the speed of light.\nNYSSA: You should evacuate!\nAUTUMN: There’s no time.\nADRIC: ‘On its current trajectory’...\nAUTUMN: What?\nADRIC: There might be a way to stop this. (BEAT) Just how big is this space telescope of yours?\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 29\nADRIC: 21. j%§INT. CONTROL SUITE.\nTEGAN: Can’t you shoot it down?\nFELL: We’ve no weaponry big enough.\nDOCTOR: We have to find some way to stop it.\nINSTRUMENT: ALARM SOUNDS.\nKALA: What’s that?\nFELL: The telescope is moving out of orbit.\nKALA: HITS A SWITCH.\nKALA: (INTO MIC) Autumn. What’s happening with the telescope?\nAUTUMN: (D) It’s alright, mother...\nAUTUMN: WORKING CONTROLS.\nAUTUMN: My friend here had an idea.\nKALA: (D) What friend?\nADRIC: Hello! Yes, I just had the thought that if we used the telescope...\nKALA: (D) Who is this?\nADRIC: I’m Adric.\nCROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR: Of course. The telescope! Bright lad.\nKALA: Another of your friends?\nDOCTOR: (INTO MIC) Adric, it’s the Doctor. Is Nyssa with you?\nNYSSA: (D) Here, Doctor!\nKALA: How many of you are there?\nDOCTOR: (IGNORING HER) Adric, I take it you’re moving the telescope into the Kepler’s path?\nADRIC: (D) Autumn is.\nDOCTOR: Good thinking!\nTEGAN: How does that help?\nDOCTOR: The Gallius Deep Space Telescope is the size of a house, Tegan.\nFELL: It’s still only one-fiftieth the size of the Kepler. Not nearly big enough to stop it.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t have to stop it. Just deflect it from its flight path.\nTEGAN: Could it do that?\nDOCTOR: Even a glancing blow might be enough.\nNYSSA: (D) Doctor — there’s a problem!\nCROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 31\nINSTRUMENT: ALARMS.\nAUTUMN: Oh, no...!\nDOCTOR: (D) What’s wrong?\nAUTUMN: (CALLING) The fail-safes are cutting in!\nADRIC: The computer is predicting the crash. It’s stopping us moving\nADRIC: the telescope into the Kepler's path!\nKALA: Those fail-safes are meant to save lives. Instead they could kill us all...\nDOCTOR: There is a way, if they switch off the navigation computer and enter the co-ordinates manually.\nKALA: We’re talking about three-dimensional positioning in zero gravity, and we’ve got minutes. Those calculations need a computer!\nDOCTOR: Or someone who’s very good with sums. (INTO MIC) Adric, did you hear that?\nCROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nADRIC: I heard.\nAUTUMN: Can you do it?\nADRIC: I suppose...\nNYSSA: The Doctor thinks you can.\nNYSSA: BEAT.\nADRIC: Page 32\nADRIC: (DETERMINED) I’1l need the exact co-ordinates of the ship and the telescope before you shut down the computer.\nAUTUMN: Let’s do it.\nSHE: TAPS CONTROLS. DATA ON SCREEN.\nAUTUMN: Co-ordinates are on screen.\nNYSSA: There. Alpha, beta and gamma axes for the Kepler and for the\nNYSSA: telescope.\nAUTUMN: Shutting off navigation computer... now.\nCOMPUTER: POWERS DOWN.\nADRIC: Okay. Got it. (TO SELF, CALCULATING) Axis to triangulation... alpha to alpha, beta to beta,\nADRIC: allowing for transposed gravitational effect...\nADRIC: I input the code?\nAUTUMN: There.\nADRIC: RAPIDLY INPUTS CODE ON A KEYBOARD.\nAUTUMN: axis\nAUTUMN: gamma to gamma...\nAUTUMN: Autumn,\nAUTUMN: where do\nAUTUMN: The telescope array is receiving the repositioning code...\nAUTUMN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nADRIC: Code complete!\nAUTUMN: The telescope is moving.\nNYSSA: Well done, Adric.\nADRIC: Let’s hope I got my sums right...\nADRIC: Page 33\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 34\nAUTUMN: (D) Confirmed. The telescope is on course towards the Kepler.\nFELL: Kepler’s speed is now one half-luminal. Time to intercept — twenty seconds.\nKALA: If your friend’s calculations are out by just one degree, Doctovr...\nDOCTOR: Have faith, Controller.\nFELL: Fifteen seconds...\nFELL: THE KEPLER SHOOTS BY AT HALF THE SPEED OF LIGHT.\nFELL: IT HITS THE GALLIAN TELESCOPE. AN EXPLOSION. SHIP’S ENGINES\nSTUTTER: AS IT’S KNOCKED OFF-COURSE.\nFELL: Impact!\nTEGAN: Adric did it?\nDOCTOR: He certainly did. What’s the course change?\nFELL: Checking now... (TAPS KEYS) Course deviation... six degrees! Impact zone... fifteen miles west of this location. The Saurian [‘SORE-ian’] desert!\nKALA: (RELIEVED) Well done the boy.\nDOCTOR: Very well done.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 35\nFELL: The Kepler is entering the atmosphere!\nFELL: THE KEPLER SCREAMS DOWN FROM THE CLOUDS AND CRASHES, SLEWING AND TEARING A GOUGE IN ROCK AND DIRT.\nTREMORS: ARE FELT FROM THE CRASH. THEY FADE.\nTEGAN: Strewth. Did you feel that?\nDOCTOR: And that was from fifteen miles away.\nKALA: Imagine if that had landed on top of us.\nTEGAN: I'd rather not.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 36\nTEGAN: AS IN THE CONTROL SUITE, TREMORS SUBSIDING.\nADRIC: We did it!\nAUTUMN: You did it! Adric, that was brilliant! I could... no, actually, I will! (SHE HUGS HIM)\nADRIC: Woah, steady on!\nAUTUMN: RELEASES ADRIC.\nAUTUMN: Three-dimensional spatial geometry, in seconds! I’ve never seen anything like it. So much for my being a prodigy.\nNYSSA: It was quite brilliant, Adric. You won’t mind if I don’t hug you?\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 37\nKALA: And now, would you two like to tell me who you are?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and this is Tegan. And what we’re doing here, well...\nKALA: You know about the Leap Drive. A highly classified secret.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I can explain that...\nKALA: You’re with the Earth Science Agency, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Are we?\nTEGAN: (QUICKLY) That’s classified.\nKALA: Sorry. Of course. Totally understood. We have to be discreet. But... thank you. I’m glad the E.S.A. sent you.\nTEGAN: The ee eSsS...?\nKALA: Don’t worry. If anyone asks, you were never here.\nDOCTOR: Well, now that’s all clear.. I’d like to find out what went wrong with your ship. Investigate the wreckage.\nKALA: General Fell, the Doctor will be joining the crash response.\nFELL: Are you sure, Controller?\nKALA: Quite sure.\nKALA: KALA AND FELL MOVE AWAY.\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) You’re getting heavily involved for someone who wanted to skedaddle half an hour ago.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: That was then. There’s something not right.\nTEGAN: You’re telling me.\nDOCTOR: Not just the crash. This whole thing shouldn’t be happening.\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: History records the first L.M.C. mission as a resounding success. There was no disaster, no crash... Something is interfering with the established timeline.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR: THE SMOULDERING WRECK OF THE HUGE SPACECRAFT IS STREWN ALL AROUND.\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR, TEGAN, FELL AND A GROUP OF RESCUERS APPROACH.\nALL: ARE IN RESPIRATOR MASKS.\nTEGAN: (MASK DISTORT) Even as a wreck, this thing’s impressive.\nDOCTOR: (D) The main fuselage is mostly intact. We should find a way\nDOCTOR: in.\nFELL: (D) Over there. There’s a cargo hatch.\nFELL: SPACIOUS, ECHOING METAL-WALLED AREA. A HATCH OPENS. THE DOCTOR, TEGAN, FELL AND THE RESCUE PARTY ENTER.\nFELL: (REMOVING MASK) You can remove your masks in here.\nFELL: DOCTOR, TEGAN AND OTHERS REMOVE MASKS.\nTEGAN: I can’t see a thing.\nDOCTOR: There’s a torch fitted in your glove. Press the palm.\nALL: CLICK ON THEIR GLOVE TORCHES.\nTEGAN: Woah! What’s that stuff everywhere?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING FORWARD ) Interesting...\nTEGAN: It looks like... coral? Red coral.\nFELL: Organic, do you think? Or - (CROUCHES DOWN)\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t touch it, General.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 40\nTEGAN: Seen anything like this before, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not quite, no.\nFELL: We'll collect samples for analysis - we’1ll use robots, don’t\nFELL: worry.\nTEGAN: Hey! This hatch is unlocked.\nSHE: OPENS IT.\nTEGAN: Dark again. I’ll shine a — [light] (SHOCK) Aah!!\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nDOCTOR: HE RUSHES TO HER SIDE.\nTEGAN: (SHAKEN) Bodies... on the floor!\nFELL: Bodies!? (HE RUSHES OVER)\nDOCTOR: Crewmembers, I presume. Dead, I’m afraid.\nTEGAN: All covered in that red coral...\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 41\nTEGAN: BUSTLE OF ACTIVITY. COMMS ALERT. KALA PRESSES A SWITCH.\nKALA: Go ahead, General. Any update since you found the bodies?\nFELL: (DISTORT) We've finished our search of the ship. There are no other bodies, and no signs of any further crew members.\nKALA: The Kepler had a crew of over three hundred... The six you found in the hold, how did they die? Was it this ‘coral’?\nFELL: (D) Impossible to say. I’ve arranged for the bodies to be\nFELL: recovered for autopsy. With full quarantine procedures.\nKALA: Well done. I have new orders for you, if you’re finished there.\nCROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 42\nCROSS TO: DAMAGED. SOME INSTRUMENTS SPARKING. IN FOREGROUND, DOCTOR IS\nTAPPING: CONTROLS.\nFELL: (BACKGROUND, INTO MIC) Almost done. We’re on the bridge and about to examine the flight data logs.\nDOCTOR: (STOPS TAPPING CONTROLS, HUSHED:) The General’s not going to like this.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing in the databanks. They’ve been wiped. Mission log, flight history, crew bio records. Everything.\nTEGAN: Wiped? Deliberately?\nDOCTOR: And thoroughly.\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) Who would do that?\nFELL: APPROACHES.\nFELL: Who would do what?\nDOCTOR: Wipe the data logs. It’s all gone, General. Anything that might have told us where this ship has been and what happened to it.\nFELL: This is an act of war. And we’re going to fight back.\nTEGAN: How?\nFELL: The Kepler had a sister ship, the Carl Sagan, that we were prepping for a rescue mission.\nFELL: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 43\nTEGAN: We saw it. From your Viewing Deck.\nFELL: Controller Tace has just reactivated that mission. But with a military objective. I’ll take the Sagan into the L.M.C., to find the enemy.\nDOCTOR: Be careful what you wish for. Look what they did to the Kepler.\nFELL: The Kepler was a civilian mission, taken by surprise. I’1ll have a brigade of Custodians.\nDOCTOR: How about a scientific adviser? I’d like to come with you.\nFELL: You pre-empt me, Doctor. The Controller has asked me to invite you along.\nDOCTOR: Splendid.\nFELL: Your assistant would be welcome also.\nTEGAN: Assistant? Oh. Me?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.. This could be very dangerous.\nTEGAN: Then you’1l need me to look after you, won’t you?\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 44\nTEGAN: AUTUMN, ADRIC AND NYSSA APPROACH THE WINDOW.\nADRIC: Now that’s what I call a spaceship.\nAUTUMN: You'll get an excellent view of the launch from here.\nADRIC: I wish I was going.\nNYSSA: The Doctor wants us to stay here to help study the red coral.\nADRIC: I won’t be much help with that.\nAUTUMN: You’1ll be much safer here, Adric.\nADRIC: I don’t want safe, I want excitement. Instead, Tegan gets to fly off to another galaxy and have all the fun.\nAUTUMN: You make it sound like a holiday.\nNYSSA: People usually return from holidays.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 45\nNYSSA: THE OPERATIONAL HEART OF THE CARL SAGAN. BUSTLE OF ACTIVITY.\nNYSSA: THE DOCTOR AND TEGAN FINISH STRAPPING THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SEATS.\nTEGAN: Strapped in!\nDOCTOR: And me. (TO FELL) Ready when you are, General.\nFELL: Thank you, Doctor. (TO THE ROOM) Initiate launch sequence.\nCREW: OPERATE CONTROLS. SHIP’S ENGINES BUILD IN POWER.\nTEGAN: Here we go.\nDOCTOR: For now, just sit back and enjoy the ride.\nFELL: Lift-off!\nENGINES: FULL THRUST. ROOM SHUDDERS.\nENGINES: THE CARL SAGAN’S ENGINES SURGE. THE MASSIVE SHIP LIFTS FROM BERTH.\nITS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 46\nITS: THE CARL SAGAN’S ENGINES HEARD DULLY THROUGH THE GLASS.\nADRIC: There they go.\nADRIC: THE SAGAN SOARS AWAY INTO THE HEAVENS.\nNYSSA: They’ve got a long journey ahead of them.\nAUTUMN: Not as long as you think. Once they reach the upper atmosphere they’1l activate the Leap Drive.\nADRIC: That’s fast, is it?\nAUTUMN: It’s not about speed. The Leap Drive folds space, like a sheet of paper. When the paper unfolds, taking them with it, they’1l be a hundred thousand light years away.\nADRIC: Clever.\nNYSSA: Safe journey, Doctor. Tegan.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 47\nNYSSA: IN FLIGHT. SHUDDERING EASES.\nFELL: (TO ROOM) Leaving the atmosphere and entering space. Stand by to activate the Leap Drive.\nFELL: HE FLICKS A SWITCH. LEAP DRIVE POWERS UP.\nDOCTOR: We'll be there in no time, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Where whoever or whatever attacked the Kepler could be waiting\nTEGAN: for us.\nDOCTOR: That’s very possible.\nFELL: Initiate Leap Drive.. now!\nFELL: A CONTROL IS ACTIVATED. ENGINES SURGE AND PEAK.\nDOCTOR: Next stop the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nDOCTOR: THE CARL SAGAN MOVING AT SPEED, ENGINES PEAKING.\nDOCTOR: THEN BOOM! SWISH!

Ours is military. I told you, I’ve got a brigade of Custodians on board.\nTEGAN: Custodians of what?\nFELL: Good order.\nDOCTOR: Soldiers, Tegan. General — do we have communications with Gallius U?\nFELL: No. Same as the Kepler, we lost comms when we entered the cloud. It’s expected, we had the same issue with the unmanned probes we’d sent in previously. But the Kepler was supposed to launch a message packet out of the cloud with updates. That didn’t happen.\nDOCTOR: When was the first packet due?\nFELL: No later than twelve hours after arrival.\nTEGAN: Then whatever happened to the Kepler, it happened within the first twelve hours.\nDOCTOR: Did any of your previous unmanned probes have difficulties?\nFELL: There were three probe missions. We lost one. Although that wasn’t a surprise.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 62\nFELL: The first two didn’t come far into the cloud.

And I don’t have many — the main garrison left with General Fell.\nNYSSA: The red coral is the key to it all. We need an inert sample for analysis.\nADRIC: We can’t go back to the Science Hub!\nNYSSA: We don’t have to. There’s still plenty on the Kepler.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 65\nKALA: The Kepler. Of course.

I’m sorry, but.. all your people were killed.\nFELL: What?!\nFELL: THE PORTAL SURGES WITH POWER.\nTEGAN: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: The ‘portal’, as our friend here called it, seems to be powering up.\nNOMAR: We should get away! It’s opening.\nTEGAN: Doctor, someone’s coming through!\nTEGAN: THE SHIMMERING PRESENCE OF A STAR MAN MOVES TOWARDS US FROM THE\nOTHER: SIDE OF THE PORTAL.\nFELL: I see them. (PEERS) Is that a man? It has a man’s shape... but there’s nothing to it. Full of... lights?\nFELL: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 72\nNOMAR: (FEARFUL) They are the Star Men.\nTEGAN: Now you mention it, he does look like he’s made of stars.\nROVUS: STEPS IN THROUGH THE PORTAL. HE — LIKE ALL STAR MEN — HAS A SHIMMERING PRESENCE, WHICH RESONATES AS HE MOVES.\nDOCTOR: (WARY) Hello... Who are you?\nDOCTOR: NO REPLY.\nFELL: Can it hear us?\nNOMAR: (ANGER) It hears you. This is the murderer of your people.\nFELL: Is that right? Did you kill the crew of this ship?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps if we could calm down...\nROVUS: They died as you will all die. (TO TEGAN) You. The female.\nTEGAN: I do have a name, as it happens. It’s — (GRABBED) Aah!\nROVUS: You will come with me.\nROVUS: HE DRAGS HER INTO THE PORTAL.\nTEGAN: Doctor, help!\nDOCTOR: (TO ROVUS) Please, leave my friend alone!\nTEGAN: (ENTERING THE PORTAL AND FADING) Doctor...!!!\nFELL: Custodians!\nDOCTOR: No, don’t shoot! You might hit [Tegan! ]\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: THE PORTAL’S POWER FADES AWAY AS THE CUSTODIANS OPEN FIRE,\nBLASTING: APART THE PORTAL MEMBRANE, SHATTERING THE CORAL SURROUND.\nDOCTOR: They’ve gone. Stop shooting!!\nFELL: Cease fire!\nSHOOTING: STOPS.\nDOCTOR: You idiots, you’ve destroyed the portal! How can we get Tegan\nDOCTOR: back now!?\nNOMAR: Your friend is lost.\nDOCTOR: Do you know where that portal leads?!\nNOMAR: To the world of the Star Men. Within the nebula.\nNOMAR: THE CORAL AROUND THEM CRACKS AND SPLITS. TRANSFORMS TO GAS.\nFELL: That coral, it’s cracking. — Is that gas?\nNOMAR: (MOVING AWAY) The red cloud! (RUNNING) Run or you will die!\nDOCTOR: You heard him! Run!\nDOCTOR: THEY RUN. THE GAS HISSES AND FOLLOWS THEM.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: 71. %INT. EXPLORER MODULE: AIRLOCK CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR, FELL, NOMAR AND CUSTODIANS RUN IN. THE GAS HISSING\nTOWARDS: US IN BACKGROUND.\nDOCTOR: Into the airlock, all of you! Quickly!\nFELL: The alien, too?\nDOCTOR: We can’t leave him here to die. Everybody in!\nDOCTOR: THEY ENTER THE AIRLOCK, WHICH SLAMS SHUT. CROSS TO:\nAIRLOCK: CLOSES. FELL ACTIVATES A WALL COMMUNICATOR.\nFELL: (INTO MIC) Pilot — this is the General. Get us away from here!\nMOMENTS: LATER, A HEAVY CLUNK AS THE SAGAN DISENGAGES. ENGINES\nSURGE: AS IT PULLS AWAY.\nDOCTOR: (RELIEF) Just in time.\nFELL: Custodians, watch that alien!\nNOMAR: I mean you no harm.\nDOCTOR: Thank you for trying to warn us. I’m the Doctor, by the way.\nNOMAR: I am Nomar, of the Vileri. Please... do you have any food?\nFELL: Never mind food. You’ve got questions to answer.\nDOCTOR: As part of a civilised conversation, General. Yes, Nomar, we have food. Then I’d like to know more about these ‘Star Men’. And where they’ve taken Tegan.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 75\nKALA: The coral was activated by the scan?\nNYSSA: It must react to a power source. Though it’s an organism in its own right, it might possibly controlled by others.\nAUTUMN: In the same way Renn and the other dead are being controlled.\nADRIC: What’s Renn doing now?\nKALA: He’s still in that corridor. The coral is growing up the walls there. He watches it. Like he’s guarding it.\nAUTUMN: Are they still jamming our communications?\nKALA: Yes.\nAUTUMN: We have to get help. We have to get a message out.\nADRIC: How?\nAUTUMN: There might be a way.\nAUTUMN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 76\nNOMAR: EATING FROM A BOWL.\nNOMAR: (EATING) Thank you. This is good. I have not eaten in three days...\nFELL: You can talk while you’re eating.\nDOCTOR: Nomar. Your people, the Vileri. Do they come from this galaxy?\nNOMAR: We are an old people, and proud.\nDOCTOR: I’ve not heard of a race like these ‘Star Men’ before. Their appearance is quite unique.\nNOMAR: Their true name, the name of their species, is the Keltin. They came to conquer my world. They numbered few, no more than a score.\nFELL: As few as that?\nNOMAR: They were all-powerful. They slaughtered many of my people. Others they took as prisoners — to work as slaves in their mines, or in their great Citadel. That is where I served them. Until my escape.\nDOCTOR: Where is this Citadel of theirs?\nNOMAR: On a planetoid. A rock they have occupied. In the nebula from which they appeared. The nebula of the stars.\nDOCTOR: The Tarantula Nebula.\nNOMAR: I do not know that name.\nFELL: They come from that hell hole?\nFELL: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: That must be where they’ve taken Tegan. General — will you help me get her back?\nFELL: More than that. We’re going on the attack.\nDOCTOR: What?\nFELL: You heard him. There aren’t many of these ‘Star Men’. We’1l go to their world alright. And we’ll wipe them off the face of it before they can attack anyone again.\nDOCTOR: You saw what they did to the Kepler!\nFELL: The Kepler was a civilian research mission. We’re trained for this.\nNOMAR: This ‘Kepler’. Was it a ship like this?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNOMAR: It was engulfed in the red cloud.\nDOCTOR: Red cloud? That’s what you called the gas that came from the coral.\nNOMAR: The red rock. The red cloud. They are controlled by the Star Men. I think... I think they are the essence of the Star Men.\nDOCTOR: How interesting. What do you mean by — [that]?\nFELL: Nomar. If we go to the nebula, could you lead us to this planetoid?\nNOMAR: I could. Many of my people are enslaved there still.\nFELL: You guide us there, we’ll take care of the Star Men. We’1ll free your people. And get Tegan back for you, Doctor.\nFELL: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 78\nFELL: WALKS AWAY.\nFELL: (MOVING AWAY) Set course for the Tarantula Nebula!\nDOCTOR: Nomar. Do you really think the General can defeat the Star Men?\nNOMAR: I will take any chance to free my people. However small.\nDOCTOR: But do you think the Star Men can be beaten?\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nNOMAR: No.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Tegan...\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR: A HIGH-CEILINGED MARBLE CHAMBER.\nTEGAN: Who are you? What are you?\nROVUS: I am Rovus. Imperator [imper-RA-tor] of the Keltin, known to some as the Star Men.\nTEGAN: You don’t look much like a man. More like a walking hole in the air.\nROVUS: You lack the ability to comprehend a life form that does not correspond to your experience.\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) I know a hole when I see it. (ALOUD) Where is this place?\nROVUS: You are in a detention chamber within our Citadel. We are many light years from your friends. But they will be coming to rescue you. They have Nomar to show them the way.\nTEGAN: They’re coming??\nROVUS: I hope so. That’s why I took you. As bait.\nTEGAN: Bait?! — Oh, no..!\nROVUS: We are ready for them, and shall destroy them. Entirely.\nTEGAN: You don’t need to do that!\nTEGAN: HE STRIDES TO THE EXIT.\nROVUS: You will remain here.\nTEGAN: Listen to me!\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 80\nROVUS: You live only so long as you are useful to us.\nROVUS: EXITS. A DOOR SLAMS DOWN.\nTEGAN: RUNS TO THE DOOR, HAMMERS ON IT.\nTEGAN: Oi! Come back! .. (STOPS HAMMERING) Rabbits.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 81\nAUTUMN: Mother — I think I know how we can beat the jamming.\nKALA: I’m listening, Autumn.\nAUTUMN: By using our satellites! — Think about it. The satellites transmit telemetry data. That’s a form of communication. I can reconfigure the satellite data net to receive the distress message and retransmit it to Earth Control. Bypassing the comms system.\nKALA: That could work.\nADRIC: It’s rather clever. Brilliant, in fact.\nAUTUMN: Thank you, Adric.\nNYSSA: Yes, but can you do it from here?\nAUTUMN: From the Central Power Room. It’s not far.\nKALA: Do it. But be careful, and stay in touch.\nADRIC: I’1l come with you.\nAUTUMN: (BRIGHTLY) Thanks. Let’s go.\nNYSSA: Good luck.\nNYSSA: ADRIC AND AUTUMN EXIT.\nNYSSA: We should check the Science Hub.\nNYSSA: BLIP. IMAGE ON SCREEN.\nKALA: That’s odd. The other dead crewmen have joined Renn in that corridor.\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 82\nNYSSA: What are they up to?\nKALA: It might be clearer once one or two of them move out of the way. There isn’t another view unfortunately. Ah, and as I say that, there you go... Oh. What is that, across the corridor? A barricade?\nNYSSA: Strange. Looks like they’ve spun some kind of organic material across the middle.\nKALA: It doesn’t look like coral. More like...\nNYSSA: Like skin.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 83\nNYSSA: THE FRONT VIEWSCREEN OPENS.\nFELL: There it is. The Tarantula Nebula.\nDOCTOR: The brightest star-forming region anywhere in this corner of the universe. It’s quite a sight.\nNOMAR: Very dangerous. The Vileri would not come here through choice.\nDOCTOR: I don’t blame you. The stars give off fierce radiation, and the stellar winds heat some areas to millions of degrees.\nFELL: This is an Explorer-class ship. It’s up to the job. [TO THE\nPILOT: ] Pilot, divert power to the forward shields.\nPILOT: Yes, General.\nPILOT: WE HEAR THE FORWARD SHIELDS POWERING UP.\nFELL: Nomar, you said the planetoid is near to the central star\nFELL: cluster?\nNOMAR: It is.\nFELL: That’s cluster R-one-thirty-six. We’ll head there, and you can guide us as we get closer. (TO CREW) All engines full ahead! THE ENGINES SURGE.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Brave heart, Tegan. We’re on our way.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR: ADRIC AND AUTUMN APPROACH AND STOP.\nADRIC: Is this it?\nAUTUMN: Yes, this is the power room.\nSHE: OPERATES A KEYPAD. DOOR OPENS. CROSS TO:\nSHE: ADRIC AND AUTUMN HALT ON THE THRESHOLD.\nAUTUMN: Woah! Red coral!\nADRIC: Keep away from it.\nAUTUMN: There are marks on the wall by the air vents. It must have come\nAUTUMN: in as a gas and solidified.\nADRIC: Where are the controls we need?\nAUTUMN: It’s that bank of switches over there.\nADRIC: They’re clear. (CROSSES TO INSTRUMENTS) We can still do this.\nAUTUMN: REMAINS WHERE SHE IS.\nAUTUMN: Adric, come back. This stuff is deadly.\nADRIC: All the more reason to get that message out before it spreads further.\nADRIC: THE CORAL CRACKS AND SPLITS. FORMING GAS, BEHIND FOLLOWING.\nAUTUMN: Adric, get out! It’s forming the gas!\nADRIC: Quickly, tell me what to do! What switches?\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 85\nAUTUMN: I’m coming over.\nADRIC: Stay back! There’s no need for both of us to be at risk.\nAUTUMN: Well, if you’re sure —\nADRIC: Of course I’m sure! Now what do I do?!\nAUTUMN: It’s the eight red switches. One for each satellite in the net. Go from left to right. But this is important — you have to wait for each one to go green.\nADRIC: Got it. Starting now.\nADRIC: HE PUSHES THE FIRST SWITCH. AFTER A MOMENT, A TONE AS IT TURNS GREEN. THEN THE NEXT.\nADRIC: Come on, come on...\nADRIC: THE GAS HISSES AND SWIRLS. CROSS TO:\nKALA: Autumn and Adric should be in the power room now. I’1l put it on screen.\nSHE: ACTIVATES THE SCREEN. WE HEAR THE CRACKING CORAL, THE\nFORMING: GAS.\nNYSSA: (SHOCKED) Adric!\nCROSS TO: A GREEN LIGHT TONE.\nADRIC: Three more to go. It takes an age for those green lights to come on!\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 86\nADRIC: THE GAS CLOSES ON ADRIC.\nAUTUMN: Adric, there’s no time! The gas is heading your way. Run!\nADRIC: I’m nearly there! Ten seconds!\nAUTUMN: You don’t have ten seconds!\nAUTUMN: HE HITS A SWITCH. AND WAITS.\nADRIC: Oh come on, come on...! (COUGHS, CHOKING, AS THE GAS ENVELOPS HIM)\nNYSSA: Adric! No!\nKALA: It’s got him. Just like my Custodian.\nCROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nADRIC: (COUGHING, CHOKING) I can’t... breathe!\nROVUS: (TELEPATHIC — IN ADRIC’S HEAD) You have failed, boy!\nADRIC: What? — Who are you?!\nAUTUMN: Adric? Who are you talking to?\nADRIC: I heard a voice! A voice in my head! The same voice that was\nADRIC: Ensign Renn!\nADRIC: Get out! Get out of my mind!!!\nROVUS: Page 87\nROVUS: in\nROVUS: (TELEPATHIC) I will destroy your mind, boy — you will belong to\nROVUS: the Star Men!\nROVUS: A RESONATING ENERGY BUILDS UP INSIDE ADRIC’S HEAD — TARGETING\nHIS: MIND.\nADRIC: (PAINED) No. No..!!!\nADRIC: END OF PART TWO\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 88"

There must be thousands of slaves in that quarry.\nNOMAR: (D) They will be worked until they die.\nDOCTOR: (D) What are they digging for?\nNOMAR: (D) A mineral called solonium [so-LOW-nium]. It’s only found in the nebula.\nDOCTOR: (D) Solonium is a ferrous mineral saturated with x-rays. Yes, they’d need a planet like this, close to a star, for that.

Where are you?\nDOCTOR: (D) On a hillside above you. Can you see the base of the Citadel?\nFELL: (D — HELMET COMMS) There’s a ridge in the way. But we’1ll reach it shortly.\nDOCTOR: (D) Get your people out of there! There’s red gas coming your way. It’s pouring from the Citadel! The red cloud, remember?!

The rest stay here. But be alert.\nKALA: THEY ENTER.\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 105\nKALA: EMPTY, MARBLE-WALLED PLACE. THE DOCTOR AND NOMAR ENTER FROM A PASSAGE.\nDOCTOR: (D) So far, so good.\nDOCTOR: A CLICK & A HISS AS THE DOCTOR REMOVES HIS HELMET.\nDOCTOR: (INHALES) The air seems good. This is really rather brave of you, Nomar.\nNOMAR: (D) Anything... (A CLICK & HISS AS HE REMOVES HIS HELMET) ..to strike back at these monsters.\nDOCTOR: Which way?\nNOMAR: The main chamber is through — [here]\nNOMAR: AN ENERGY BOLT, FIRED BY A STAR MAN, SHOOTS FROM A PASSAGE AHEAD AND STRIKES THE FLOOR.\nNOMAR: Star Men!\nROVUS: ENTERS FROM ONE PASSAGE. FOUR OTHER STAR MEN FROM OTHERS\nALL: AROUND THE DOCTOR & NOMAR.\nALL: We're surrounded!\nROVUS: That was a warning shot only.\nDOCTOR: Hello again. We met before, I believe. You’re the one who took Tegan!\nNOMAR: Doctor... this is Rovus. Imperator of the Keltin. Leader of the Star Men.\nROVUS: Welcome back, Nomar... I’ve missed you.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 106\nROVUS: THE HUM OF THE PORTAL HEARD DULLY NEARBY AS NYSSA, KALA AND TWO\nCUSTODIANS: APPROACH.\nKALA: (SOTTO) Corridor 4M is the next left.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) I’1l go forward and have a look round the corner.\nKALA: (SOTTO) Be careful. Don’t let them see you.\nFOLLOW: NYSSA AS SHE MOVES FORWARD. HUM OF THE PORTAL GROWING\nSTRONGER: AS SHE NEARS IT, AND HAS A SURREPTITIOUS LOOK AROUND THE CORNER.\nSHE: RETURNS TO KALA.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) They’re standing over that membrane, like they’re on guard.\nKALA: (SOTTO) Have you got any idea what it is?\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) Not much. It seems to be organic technology. It has power, too, to judge by the way it’s glowing.\nKALA: (SOTTO) Whatever it’s for, it can’t be good. Time to go on the offensive. Custodians. Stand by.\nKALA: 2 x CUSTODIANS RAISE THEIR GUNS.\nKALA: (SOTTO) When I give the word, move forward and open fire. Destroy that thing. Then run.\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 107\nKALA: THE DOCTOR AND NOMAR ARE BROUGHT IN BY ROVUS.\nROVUS: And here she is. Your friend.\nTEGAN: Doctor! Am I glad to see you!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Are you well?\nTEGAN: Well enough. Scared out of my wits, mind.\nNOMAR: Rovus has that effect.\nROVUS: Found some nerve, have you, Nomar? You were such an obedient, respectful servant once. I hope the humans behave better.\nDOCTOR: I’m not human.\nROVUS: I have no interest in what you are.\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. A Time Lord?\nROVUS: And what is a “Time Lord”?\nDOCTOR: It’s the job of my people to stop interference with the time lines. Interference like yours.\nROVUS: I change my mind. I think you do interest me.\nDOCTOR: You don’t belong in this time and place. Where have you come from?\nROVUS: Another... place. It’s of little consequence.\nDOCTOR: Of as little consequence as the lives you ended out there, in that slaughter?\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 108\nROVUS: They came as aggressors and met their just end.\nROVUS: OPERATES CONTROLS WITH A SHIMMERING WAVE OF HIS ARM.\nMELODIC: RESPONSES. AN IMAGE MATERIALISES IN THE AIR.\nROVUS: As will these others, in their ship in orbit.\nTEGAN: That’s the Carl Sagan. But what’s that?\nDOCTOR: The red cloud. It’s what destroyed the Kepler, Tegan.\nROVUS: They have tried valiantly — but in vain — to evade the cloud.\nDOCTOR: Rovus, stop this. Now. Please.\nROVUS: We do not allow such aggressors to live.\nROVUS: HE WAVES HIS ARM. CONTROLS RESPOND.\nROVUS: See? The red cloud envelops the ship. Penetrating it.\nROVUS: Smothering the crew. Crippling the ship’s systems...\nHEARD: FAINTLY FROM THE IMAGE, EXPLOSIONS BREAK OUT ACROSS THE\nCARL: SAGAN.\nROVUS: I wanted the first ship intact, to return to the humans, to\nROVUS: destroy them.. But this vessel, I do not require.\nDOCTOR: No!\nFURTHER: DEVASTATING EXPLOSIONS — THE CARL SAGAN DESTROYED\nROVUS: How quickly it succumbs to the cloud.\nTEGAN: All those people!\nTEGAN: HE DEACTIVATES THE IMAGE.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (\nDOCTOR: That was unnecessary!\nROVUS: We must agree to differ. Now...\nNOMAR: Do your worst.\nROVUS: My worst... Yes. I may well “do\nVEDRIN: ENTERS FROM AN ADJACENT\nVEDRIN: Yes, Imperator?\nROVUS: Send Nomar to the Dark.\nVEDRIN: Immediately.\nNOMAR: Rovus, no!\nDOCTOR: What is the Dark?\nROVUS: Take the woman away, also.\nTEGAN: No chance!\nDOCTOR: Tegan stays with me!\nROVUS: You are one more outburst away will not be harmed, so long as\nDOCTOR: If any harm comes to her — to\nROVUS: You do not dictate terms. But... nothing else. Until you hear f\nVEDRIN: Understood.\nVEDRIN: FINAL) Page 109\nVEDRIN: Nomar. What am I to do with you?\nVEDRIN: my worst”. Vedrin!\nVEDRIN: CHAMBER.\nVEDRIN: from death, Doctor. This ‘Tegan’ you comply.\nVEDRIN: either of them...\nVEDRIN: Vedrin, take them away, and rom me.\nVEDRIN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 110\nTEGAN: Doctor? You don’t expect me just to go along with this?\nDOCTOR: We have to take Rovus at his word, Tegan.\nROVUS: Indeed. Vedrin, go.\nTEGAN: (TO DOCTOR) Well, I hope you know what you’re letting me in for.\nTEGAN: VEDRIN, TEGAN AND NOMAR EXIT.\nDOCTOR: So. Rovus. Imperator of the Keltin, the ‘Star Men’...\nROVUS: (AMUSED) Our race is Keltin. The ‘Star Men’... it is a name others say. Quietly. With fear.\nDOCTOR: Keltin or Star Men, your species is virtually impossible. You have the outline of a person, but no face, not what I’d normally call a body.\nROVUS: Perhaps you need to reconsider what is possible. Allow your mind to expand, to imagine another ...\nDOCTOR: . another reality? Another universe?\nROVUS: Well done.\nDOCTOR: I knew you couldn’t be from this galaxy. But you’re not even from this universe. You’re from somewhere where the rules of physics are quite different.\nROVUS: Are all Time Lords as astute as you?\nDOCTOR: I’ve travelled. Widely.\nROVUS: You are quite right. We are new to this universe.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR: But by coming here you’ve insinuated yourselves into this reality’s time stream. You’re altering human history when they’re on the verge of expanding across the cosmos.\nROVUS: How can you know that?\nDOCTOR: As I said. I’m a Time Lord.\nROVUS: I did well to keep you alive. Your knowledge will be very useful.\nDOCTOR: I’m not here to give you my knowledge. I’m here to stop you doing further damage.\nROVUS: You cannot stop us! And I will have all the information from you I desire. Even if I have to force it from you.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 112\nROVUS: A LONG HIGH-CEILINGED CORRIDOR. TEGAN, NOMAR AND VEDRIN WALK ALONG.\nTEGAN: Oi, Vedrin. That’s your name, isn’t it? Where are you taking\nTEGAN: us?\nVEDRIN: Be silent.\nTEGAN: What’s Rovus up to? Why pick a fight with everyone?\nNOMAR: The Star Men won’t tolerate other advanced civilisations.\nVEDRIN: Quiet, Nomar.\nNOMAR: They believe in their absolute superiority. Their right to rule over all.\nVEDRIN: Be silent.\nNOMAR: They conquer to obtain the energy they need.\nVEDRIN: BUT NOMAR INTENDED THIS.\nNOMAR: (DUCKING THE BLOW) Run, Tegan! (WRESTLES WITH VEDRIN,\nRESTRAINING: HIM) I’11 hold him.. as long as I can!\nTEGAN: Nomar!\nNOMAR: (STRUGGLING) Go!\nTEGAN: (RUNNING) Catch me up!\nTEGAN: RUNS OFF.\nTEGAN: VEDRIN’S SHIMMERING PRESENCE FLUCTUATES AS HE STRUGGLES.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 113\nVEDRIN: (STRUGGLING) I am too strong for you! You cannot hold me!\nNOMAR: (LOSING THE STRUGGLE) You may be right! But I’m... faster! (ON ‘FASTER’, HE PUSHES VEDRIN AWAY AND RUNS)\nVEDRIN: (SHOVED ASIDE) Gah! Stop. Stop...!\nVEDRIN: FIRES AN ENERGY BOLT THAT HITS THE WALL.\nVEDRIN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 114\nVEDRIN: A PORTAL STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. IT RESONATES WITH LOWER, MORE OMINOUS RESONANCE THAN BEFORE.\nTEGAN: RUNS IN.\nTEGAN: (RECOVERING FROM RUNNING) Oh great. A dead end.\nNOMAR: RUNS IN.\nNOMAR: (RECOVERING) Vedrin is right behind us!\nTEGAN: There’s nowhere to run. Except for the portal.\nNOMAR: It’s been re-set. That portal leads to the Dark!\nTEGAN: What’s the Dark?\nNOMAR: It’s the Star Men’s worst punishment.\nTEGAN: But if it’s a portal, it’ll take us away from here, yes?\nNOMAR: No-one ever returns.\nTEGAN: Maybe because they don’t want to!\nTEGAN: OFF, VEDRIN APPROACHES AT A RUN.\nVEDRIN: (OFF) Nomar...!\nTEGAN: He’s almost here! We’ve no choice! Come on! (SHE RUNS AND\nLEAPS: )\nNOMAR: No, don’t!\nNOMAR: AS TEGAN HITS THE PORTAL THERE IS AN OMINOUS RESONANCE. THEN SHE’S GONE.\nNOMAR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 115\nVEDRIN: (ARRIVING) There you are! Where’s the woman...?\nNOMAR: (TO SELF) Tegan. I will not let you go alone into the Dark.\nNOMAR: RUNS, LEAPS. AGAIN THE RESONANT SOUND, BUT NOW WE GO WITH HIM, PASSING THROUGH INTO —\nNOMAR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nNOMAR: [ CONTINUOUS ]\nNOMAR: THE PLANET HELIOPAN,\nNOMAR: Page 116\nNOMAR: IN THE STAR MEN’S REALITY. A TRULY ALIEN\nNOMAR: ENVIRONMENT. HOWLING, MOANING WIND. THE GROUND SHIFTS SHALE-\nLIKE: BENEATH OUR FEET. OCCASIONAL THUNDER CRACKS.\nNOMAR: COMPLETES HIS LEAP AND LANDS ON THE SHIFTING GROUND.\nNOMAR: (LANDING) Oof!\nTEGAN: (NEARBY) Nomar!\nDIALOGUE: PROJECTED ABOVE THE AMBIENT SOUNDSCAPE.\nNOMAR: Tegan?\nTEGAN: What is this place?!\nNOMAR: Nor I!\nTEGAN: I can’t...\nTEGAN: I can’t focus on it!\nTEGAN: (UNSTEADY) The ground is moving.\nNOMAR: I think... I think this where they came from. A CREATURE’S CALL, IN\nTEGAN: What was that?\nTEGAN: IT SHRIEKS AGAIN.\nTEGAN: On second thoughts\nTEGAN: is their home.\nTEGAN: The Star Men. This\nDISTANCE: — SHRIEKING, ULULATING.\nDISTANCE: — I don’t want to know.\nDISTANCE: is\nDISTANCE: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: I must say, your physiology is fascinating, Rovus. Very different from almost anything I’ve encountered.\nROVUS: We are perfect beings. Free from the limitations of flesh and bone.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. Nothing’s perfect. For one thing, you still need to feed.. On solonium — mined by your Vileri slaves, I understand?\nROVUS: (WARY) Nomar has informed you well. The solonium we need is mined, and brought to the Citadel. I will show you.\nROVUS: HE APPROACHES A WALL, WAVES A HAND AND A PANEL OPENS.\nDOCTOR: That’s your larder, I take it?\nROVUS: Abandon any hopes of defeating us by destroying it, Doctor. We keep stores of solonium throughout the Citadel.\nDOCTOR: It’s very rare in this universe. It needs intense solar x-rays.\nROVUS: The energy of suns. That is what we feed on. Watch.\nROVUS: LIFTS A ROCK OF SOLONIUM. IT IS SUDDENLY ENERGISED.\nROVUS: See how it reacts as I lift it? Solonium responds to our molecular coding. Now, it releases its stellar energy into me, through my hand.\nROVUS: HE IS SUFFUSED WITH TINGLING, EFFERVESCENT ENERGY.\nROVUS: I feel the rush as it fills me and sustains me.\nROVUS: THE ROCK DRAINS OF ENERGY AND FALLS SILENT.\nROVUS: When it is drained, the once-smooth rock becomes this jagged residue.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR: The red coral.\nROVUS: Which continues to have its uses. The process of feeding also links us with the coral, as you call it. We can.. manipulate it.\nDOCTOR: And use it to kill. You’d do anything to survive.\nROVUS: To survive we need solonium. To harvest it, we need stars. We are not aggressors by choice, Doctor. Our reality, our universe, is dying. The last of its energy is being depleted.\nDOCTOR: Entropy? You’ve not heard of a place called E-Space, by any chance?\nROVUS: Entropy?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps not.\nROVUS: We used our last reserves of energy to open a route to this reality.\nDOCTOR: That would have needed a colossal amount of energy. On both sides of the transfer. The equivalent of... (REALISATION) several newborn stars! Of course, in the Tarantula Nebula! That’s why you ripped a hole between your reality and here.\nROVUS: Indeed.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, why are there so few of you?\nROVUS: Others will follow.\nDOCTOR: You’re just the advance party? But you’ve been here some months, according to Nomar. When will the others follow?\nROVUS: In time.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR: There’s something you’re hiding.\nROVUS: You overstep the mark, Time Lord.\nVEDRIN: RUNS IN.\nVEDRIN: Imperator?! It’s Nomar. And the girl...\nDOCTOR: Tegan? What’s happened?\nVEDRIN: They ran from me. They have gone into the Dark.\nROVUS: (LAUGHS) Nomar has provided his own punishment!\nDOCTOR: What is the Dark?\nROVUS: It is the link with our old reality, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: She’s gone there? To your universe? Please, you must get her back!\nROVUS: There is no return. She is gone forever.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 120\nTEGAN: I can see a little better now.\nNOMAR: Me too. Although what I see is a nightmare.\nTEGAN: It feels like my brain is adjusting, making sense of it. Those mountains look solid enough now, even if the colour of the sky is giving me a headache. (SUDDEN THOUGHT) Hey Nomar? .. We came through a portal.\nNOMAR: I know.\nTEGAN: So there should be another portal at this end, shouldn’t there? For us to get back.\nNOMAR: I told you. No-one ever comes back.\nTEGAN: Then we’re stuck here? For good?\nNOMAR: For as long as we live. Which won’t be long, if we can’t find food.\nNOMAR: THE CREATURE SHRIEKS. NOW IN MID-DISTANCE.\nTEGAN: Starvation might not be the only way to die here.\nTEGAN: A FIGURE SCRAMBLES TOWARDS THEM FROM UP THE SLOPE. LOM IS A\nREPTILIAN: ALIEN AND SPEAKS WITH A HISSING RATTLE.\nLOM: (NEARBY) If you want to stay alive, come with me!\nTEGAN: A lizard man?!\nCREATURE: SHRIEKS AGAIN — CLOSE NOW.\nLOM: A friend, I believe. The Krail Beasts are hungry. I have seen many men run through on the point of their horns. But if you choose not to be their meal — I have a shelter nearby.\nLOM: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nTEGAN: Fair enough. — We’re coming!\nTEGAN: NOMAR AND TEGAN RUN UP THE SLOPE.\nTEGAN: Page 121\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR: There must be some way to get Tegan and Nomar back!\nROVUS: We tried to establish a portal link with our universe. It was not possible except for a one-way connection. The portal can travel to our universe; it cannot connect to this one.\nDOCTOR: Take me to this portal.\nROVUS: So you can throw yourself through it as they did? No, Doctor. You are invaluable to me.\nDOCTOR: In what way?\nROVUS: Until recently, all we knew of this universe was this one small galaxy. Now we learn there is another, ten times the size.\nDOCTOR: The Milky Way.\nROVUS: It is teeming with life. With over one hundred billion stars.\nDOCTOR: Got your eye on it, have you?\nROVUS: There are countless other galaxies, too. Ones you have knowledge of, yes?\nDOCTOR: You should learn about them the way I did. By travelling. It broadens the mind, you know.\nROVUS: Oh, we intend to travel. And very soon. When the Keltin Core is in this universe, all life forms will tremble.\nDOCTOR: The Keltin Core? What’s that?\nROVUS: (HE’S SAID TOO MUCH) In time, Doctor... In time, you will know. And then you will — [STOPS HIMSELF]\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR: Everything alright, Rovus? You seem distracted.\nROVUS: I see through the eyes of the integrated. I see Gallius Ultima. Through the eyes of “Ensign Renn”. Your friends are about to do something... very foolish.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 124\nPORTAL: HUMS, OFF. AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR, KALA, NYSSA AND THE TWO CUSTODIANS MOVE CLOSER.\nKALA: (SOTTO) Quiet. On my command...\nROVUS: (OFF) In the shadows, at the end of the corridor. Someone is there!\nCADAVERS: LURCH FORWARD FROM OFF.\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) They’ve seen us!\nKALA: The corpses, they’re coming for us! — Fire!\nKALA: 2 x CUSTODIANS OPEN FIRE. THEY ONLY GET A FEW SHOTS OFF BEFORE THE CADAVERS FALL ON THEM.\nCUSTODIANS: (CRY OUT AS THEY ARE KILLED) Aaaah!\nNYSSA: Kala — run!\nNYSSA: NYSSA AND KALA RUN FOR THEIR LIVES.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 125\nROVUS: The issue has been... dealt with.\nDOCTOR: What have you done?\nROVUS: (IGNORING HIM) Vedrin, we will bring our plans forward. You will go to the human base. Take control.\nVEDRIN: Yes, Rovus.\nDOCTOR: You won’t win.\nROVUS: We have crushed their army, and we now know everything there is to know about this Gallius Ultima. Humanity cannot prevail against us.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 126\nROVUS: NYSSA AND KALA RUN IN. KALA PRESSES KEYPAD. BULKHEAD CLOSES.\nKALA: (RECOVERING) Sealed! They killed the Custodians!\nNYSSA: (RECOVERING) They haven’t followed us. I daresay they didn’t want to leave that membrane they’re guarding.\nKALA: PRESSES WALL CONTROLS.\nKALA: We can get the camera feed direct to this terminal.\nSMALL: WALL SCREEN POWERS UP.\nNYSSA: Yes, they’re still there. Like nothing happened.\nKALA: With my men dead at their feet.\nTHROUGH: SCANNER, WE HEAR AN ENERGY BUILDUP FROM THE PORTAL.\nNYSSA: Something’s happening to the membrane.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 127\nADRIC: STIRS, REVIVES.\nADRIC: (WAKING) Three hundred and seventy — (AWAKE, ALERT) That voice!\nAUTUMN: Adric, it’s alright. You’re safe.\nADRIC: Autumn? Thank goodness! I thought I was still... Where am I?\nAUTUMN: In a recovery room. You were unconscious.\nADRIC: When I was attacked, I heard a voice... in my head. It told me I was going to die. It was like the Star Man was inside my mind.\nAUTUMN: ‘Star Man’...?\nADRIC: Yes, that’s what they’re called. It’s not their real name, though— (STOPS HIMSELF) Wait. How did I know that?\nAUTUMN: I was about to ask you.\nADRIC: It’s coming back to me! We were linked! When he was getting into my head, I got into his! I know what they’re planning!\nAUTUMN: What?\nADRIC: His thoughts were strange. Images rather than words. But I saw these Star Men. This base was destroyed! And the Star Men... spreading everywhere, to other worlds. Killing. And they’re going to start here. The Star Men are coming. Lots of them!\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 128\nPORTAL: REVERBERATES WITH ENERGY. VEDRIN EMERGES.\nVEDRIN: Hear me, Rovus.

Take control of this place. Kill all who resist... These\nROVUS: cadavers are no longer needed.

You are welcome.\nTEGAN: Do you live here?\nLOM: As best I can. I am the last of my kind. The others... are dead. This world and everything beyond it is dying.\nTEGAN: What is this world?\nLOM: You are on the planet Heliopan [HE-lee-oh-pan]. Sent here by the Star Men, no doubt. It is my home. It breaks my heart to see it now.\nNOMAR: What happened?\nLOM: The Star Men killed it. Bled it dry. As they have bled this universe dry in search of the energy they need.\nTEGAN: They did that?\nLOM: Look outside and you will see what they did. They are world killers.\nLOM: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nLOM: SOUNDS OF BATTLE IN THE BACKGROUND.

The membranes are portals. That’s how these ‘Star Men’ got here.\nKALA: (SOTTO) More to the point — if they can place more of them anywhere they like, we’ll be completely overrun.\nVEDRIN: Silence. The Imperator is coming.\nENERGY: BUILDS WITHIN THE PORTAL. AS IT PEAKS, ROVUS EMERGES WITH THE DOCTOR.\nNYSSA: DOCTOR!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. Hello!\nROVUS: (GOING TO TARDIS) Vedrin, this box — is this the vessel you spoke of?\nVEDRIN: It resists all attempts to force entry. Its energy signature suggests temporal capability, and that it is in dimensional flux.\nROVUS: A vessel fit for a Time Lord. — Eh, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That blue box has nothing to do with me, Rovus.\nROVUS: Don’t try to fool me, Doctor. Open your time machine. Now!\nDOCTOR: No, sorry. You’re doing enough damage to the timeline as it is.\nROVUS: Vedrin.\nVEDRIN: GRABS HOLD OF NYSSA.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: Let Nyssa go!\nROVUS: Doctor, you have already lost one of your friends to the Dark...

Trust me.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nKALA: If it will save lives... yes.\nROVUS: Excellent.\nKALA: We’ll need to go to the control suite.\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 138\nROVUS: Vedrin, bring the Doctor.\nKALA: (SOTTO) I don’t know whether to thank you or curse you.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) It buys us some time. Enough, I hope, to save your\nDOCTOR: people... and my friends.\nDOCTOR: THEY EXIT.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 139\nLOM: Heliopan was once a beautiful world, under the heat of three suns.\nTEGAN: Three? What happened to the other two?\nLOM: Reduced to husks by the Keltin.\nNOMAR: Then they would do the same in our universe?\nTEGAN: We have to — [get back]\nNYSSA: (OFF) Help! Help!!!\nLOM: Who was that?\nTEGAN: It sounded like... Is that Nyssa?!\nTEGAN: RUNS OUT.\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 140\nTHREE: KRAIL CLOSING ON NYSSA, SNARLING.\nNYSSA: Keep back! (PICKS UP A SMALL ROCK) I know how to throw, I’ve seen the Doctor do it often enough — (THROWS IT)\nNYSSA: A KRAIL, HIT, SHRIEKS IN PAIN. RETREATS.\nNYSSA: How’s that?! (PICKS UP ANOTHER)\nNYSSA: 2 x KRAIL SNARL DEFIANTLY, EDGE CLOSER.\nTEGAN: (NEARBY) Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Tegan! The Doctor said you’d been sent here — (EFFORT; THROWS\nANOTHER: STONE)\nKRAIL: SHRIEKS, HIT.\nTEGAN: You won’t bowl those things out with stones! — Quick! Up here!\nTEGAN: There’s a cave!\nNYSSA: Oh, thank goodness!\nNYSSA: SCRAMBLES UP THE SLOPE. THE KRAIL SHRIEK IN ANGER.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 141\nTEGAN: ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY BREATHLESS NYSSA.\nTEGAN: Come on. You’ll be safe in here. Lom says the Krail don’t come into the caves.\nLOM: They fear the dark. Soon, they will tire and move away.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, this is Lom, and that’s Nomar.\nNOMAR: Greetings.\nTEGAN: Nyssa’s a friend of mine. We travel together.\nNYSSA: Tegan — where are we, exactly?\nTEGAN: This might take a while...\nTEGAN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 142\nTEGAN: ADRIC AND AUTUMN RUNNING.\nADRIC: It’s hopeless running, Autumn! The Star Men are everywhere!\nAUTUMN: We have to find Mother. Tell her everything you learned about them!\nAUTUMN: KALA’S VOICE COMES OVER TANNOY.\nKALA: (D) All personnel, this is Controller Tace.\nKALA: ADRIC AND AUTUMN STOP.\nADRIC: That’s her!\nKALA: (D) All resistance to the alien presence — to these ‘Star Men’ — will cease.\nAUTUMN: I don’t believe it!\nKALA: (DISTORT) Regular personnel will go to their habitats. Custodians will put down their arms. The Star Men are now in command of Gallius U.\nTRANSMISSION: CLOSES.\nAUTUMN: That’s it. We’ve lost!\nADRIC: Your mother might have surrendered, but we don’t have to!\nAUTUMN: What choice have we got?\nADRIC: It’s not a choice. I’ve seen what they’re planning to do...\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 143\nKALA: Satisfied, Rovus?\nROVUS: Very good, Controller.\nDOCTOR: It was the right thing to do, Kala.\nKALA: The question is: have I saved my people? Or just made it easier for the Star Men to slaughter them?\nROVUS: Vedrin? Prepare the signal. To read, ‘Compatibility confirmed. Bridgehead established.’\nVEDRIN: At once. (TURNS AND LEAVES)\nDOCTOR: ‘Bridgehead’? I don’t like the sound of that.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 144\nLOM: One by one, the galaxies throughout this universe have gone dark. Until now there is just this one corner of light.\nNYSSA: So with so few suns remaining here, the Star Men needed to look elsewhere for their...\nTEGAN: ‘food’?\nLOM: The Keltin — the Star Men — found a way to tear an opening between universes. Yours was not the first they visited. But it was the first that they found to be suitable. If Rovus’s group has been there as long as you say, I think it is likely he will make a bridgehead there. Then the other Keltin will follow.\nTEGAN: Other Star Men?\nLOM: Legions, from across this universe. They wait with the Keltin Core.\nNYSSA: What’s the Keltin Core?\nLOM: A planet-sized piece of pure solonium. The birthplace of the Keltin. The Core is the place where the first Star Men were fashioned. Forged from solonium, shaped into their current form.\nNYSSA: The physics of this world is very different from our own.\nNOMAR: This solonium. When the Star Men have absorbed its energy, it becomes red coral.\nTEGAN: So the Star Men, they’re the red coral in another form?\nLOM: The highest form, possessed of great intellect — but in this they are merely agents of the Core. The Core is sentient. The Star Men are linked to it. The Core controls them, and gives them direction.\nLOM: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 145\nNYSSA: If they depend on it, then the Core is their vulnerability.\nLOM: Without the Core, they would cease to function. But it is protected.\nTEGAN: I don’t see how we could do much about it anyway. I mean look at us. Stuck in a hole.\nNOMAR: With no weapons and no ship.\nNYSSA: We don’t even know where this Core is. Or the rift.\nLOM: The rift is here.\nTEGAN: What?!\nLOM: The rift, the door to your universe, is here. I can show you.\nNOMAR: (STANDING) Please! Yes.\nLOM: (STANDING) Come with me.\nTEGAN: What about those creatures? The Krail?\nLOM: They are stupid. But we shall be careful.\nLOM: THEY FOLLOW LOM OUT.\nLOM: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 146\nKALA: A bridgehead?\nDOCTOR: It seems that’s the Star Men’s way. An advance party secures territory, and a larger group follows. It’s what they did by using the bodies of your dead to set up that first portal on this base. Preparing for their invasion.\nKALA: An invasion? Of Gallius U?\nDOCTOR: I expect their ambitions reach much further than this planet.\nROVUS: Correct, Doctor.\nKALA: You and your people might have won this base without a fight, but don’t expect humanity and the other races of this galaxy to be such a pushover.\nDOCTOR: He’s going to have some help. More of his kind. Rovus and his Star Men are just the vanguard.\nROVUS: And when this galaxy has been won we shall continue, to the next galaxy, and the next. This universe offers rich pickings. So many stars.\nDOCTOR: Others would stand in your way. The Daleks, for one.\nROVUS: All will be swept aside. Now, Doctor... The matter of your time machine.\nDOCTOR: I wondered when we’d come back to that...\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR: LOM, TEGAN, NYSSA AND NOMAR ON A RISING TRACK.\nNOMAR: How much further to the rift, Lom?\nLOM: Not far. To the top of this rise.\nTEGAN: Nyssa. This rift — you think it might be our way back?\nNYSSA: I don’t see how we can hope to escape this universe otherwise.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 148\nNYSSA: DOCTOR, ROVUS AND KALA WALKING.\nROVUS: When we reach your time machine, Doctor, you will open it — or I will kill the Controller.\nKALA: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: It won’t come to that, Kala. I hope.\nADRIC: APPEARS AT FAR END OF CORRIDOR.\nADRIC: (OFF) Hey! Star Man!\nDOCTOR: Adric?!\nKALA: What’s he doing down the other end of the corridor?\nROVUS: Boy! Come here!\nROVUS: RUNS AFTER ADRIC.\nADRIC: (RUNNING) Bye!\nDOCTOR: (TO KALA) Taunting Rovus, it appears.\nAUTUMN: (OPPOSITE END OF CORRIDOR) Mother! Doctor! Here, quick!\nKALA: Autumn? !\nFOLLOW: DOCTOR AND KALA AS THEY RUN TO AUTUMN. MEANWHILE:\nROVUS: (RUNNING) Boy! Stop! (STOPPING) Wait. What is this? (TURNS; SEES THE DOCTOR AND KALA RUNNING OFF) Doctor! Controller! Stay still! (BEGINS TO STOMP BACK)\nDOCTOR: Close the bulkhead, Autumn! Quickly!\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 149\nAUTUMN: TAPS A KEYPAD AND A BULKHEAD SLAMS INTO PLACE.\nROVUS: . AS BULKHEAD CLOSES, SEALING THE OTHERS OFF.\nDOCTOR: Well done!\nAUTUMN: Good teamwork, eh?\nKALA: That bulkhead won’t stop Rovus for long.\nKALA: THE BULKHEAD SHUDDERS WITH ENERGY FROM ROVUS’S ENERGY ASSAULT.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Run!\nTHEY RUN OFF. CROSS TO: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 150\nTHEY RUN OFF. CROSS TO: DOCTOR, KALA AND AUTUMN RUN IN. ADRIC RUNS IN FROM ANOTHER DIRECTION.\nDOCTOR: Adric!\nADRIC: Hello, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: That was hideously dangerous.\nAUTUMN: (NUDGING DOCTOR) But very courageous!\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, I suppose so —\nADRIC: It worked, didn’t it?\nKALA: We need to get out of sight.\nDOCTOR: More importantly, we need to get access to the base computer system.\nAUTUMN: The Astronomy Hub?\nDOCTOR: Lead on.\nDOCTOR: THEY RUN OFF.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 151\nVEDRIN: WALKS ALONG. ROVUS STRIDES TOWARDS HIM.\nROVUS: Vedrin! The Doctor and the Controller have escaped!\nVEDRIN: Escaped?!\nROVUS: I’ll tear this place apart to find them. Return to the nebula. Be prepared to send the signal when I give the word.\nVEDRIN: Understood.\nVEDRIN: HURRIES AWAY.\nVEDRIN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 152\nVEDRIN: DESERTED. THE DOCTOR, KALA, ADRIC AND AUTUMN HURRY IN.\nAUTUMN: Here we are. The Astronomy Hub.\nDOCTOR: Excellent!\nADRIC: I take it you’ve got a plan?\nDOCTOR: You know me, Adric.\nKALA: Then what is it?\nDOCTOR: First things first. The orbital telescope was knocked out by the Kepler. Is there any other way to observe the Tarantula Nebula in detail?\nAUTUMN: How much detail?\nDOCTOR: Enough for a spectrographic and gravitational analysis.\nAUTUMN: Only the orbital telescope could do that. We’re in the wrong aspect for the ground observatory to get that view.\nDOCTOR: Pity. In fact, disastrous.\nAUTUMN: Hang on. Are you after live data, or would historical do?\nDOCTOR: If historical is within the last few weeks.\nAUTUMN: We have a cached record of recent readings from the Nebula.\nDOCTOR: Perfect!\nAUTUMN: Here.\nAUTUMN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 153\nSHE: TAPS A KEYBOARD. IMAGES AND DATA APPEAR ON A SCREEN.\nAUTUMN: This was four days ago.\nDOCTOR: Can you isolate star cluster R one-three-six?\nAUTUMN: TAPS KEYBOARD.\nKALA: What are you looking for?\nDOCTOR: Anomalies in mass, gravity, radiation, light wave emissions... Adric?\nADRIC: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Could you look at gravity and mass equations? See if you can spot anything unusual - anything that doesn’t fit.\nADRIC: Right!\nADRIC: TAKES A SEAT, STARTS WORK AT ANOTHER KEYBOARD.\nDOCTOR: Autumn, if you could punch up the spectrographic and radiographic readings...\nAUTUMN: Sure.\nKALA: What’s all this for, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Rovus is expecting more of his people. They have to come through somewhere, but the portals they make are too small. My theory is that there’s a tear in space — a rift in the Tarantula Nebula. The R one-three-six cluster is the most likely area.\nADRIC: Doctor! I’ve got something!\nDOCTOR: Show me.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 154\nADRIC: Look - there’s a gravitational dip somewhere around that supergiant, see?\nDOCTOR: Meaning something in that area of space is reducing the gravity from the supergiant.\nKALA: This rift of yours.\nDOCTOR: Very probably. An opening into the universe of the Star Men. That’s where their invasion will come from!\nAUTUMN: But can it be closed?\nDOCTOR: Well, I have friends on the other side, and I’d like them back first. But possibly, perhaps with a very large explosion... Before that, however, we have to find out precisely where it is.\nADRIC: Well, how do we do that?\nDOCTOR: We’d have to get access to one of the Star Men’s portals. The one by the TARDIS won’t be easy to get to.\nKALA: There’s another portal in the Science Hub. We can check the camera network to see if they’ve left it unguarded.\nDOCTOR: In which case... Adric?\nADRIC: Yes?\nDOCTOR: How would you like to put your space navigation training into practice?\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: LOM, NOMAR, TEGAN AND NYSSA REACH A CREST. HEARD FAINTLY, FAR OFF, A BURNING SCAR IN THE SKY.\nLOM: There. You see it now.\nNYSSA: That’s the rift?\nTEGAN: (CRESTFALLEN) It’s in the sky..!\nNYSSA: In space. It’s huge.\nLOM: Did you think it would be on the surface?\nTEGAN: I’d hoped it might be a way home. Like one of those portals.\nNYSSA: It might as well be on the other side of this universe.\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 156\nNYSSA: THE DOCTOR, KALA AND ADRIC — WHO’S WEARING A SURVIVAL SUIT WITHOUT THE HELMET — BESIDE THE HUMMING PORTAL.\nDOCTOR: Here’s the portal. You know what to do, Adric?\nADRIC: Through the portal, straight through three chambers, turn left and I’m outside the citadel.\nDOCTOR: You’11l see assault ships in the valley. Use one of them to navigate to the R one-three-six cluster. When you get there, the onboard systems will guide you to the rift.\nADRIC: Got it.\nDOCTOR: All I want you to do is find the exact location. Nothing else. No heroics. Come back with the co-ordinates.\nADRIC: Doctor, if Tegan and Nyssa are through that rift...\nDOCTOR: No heroics! We’1ll get them back, but I don’t want to lose you too. Understood?\nADRIC: (RELUCTANT) Understood.\nDOCTOR: If I’m successful here, we’ll have plenty of time to get Tegan and Nyssa.\nADRIC: I’d better be off... (PUTS ON AND LOCKS HIS HELMET) (D) Good luck.\nDOCTOR: And you.\nADRIC: (HELMET DISTORT) Bye!\nADRIC: HE LEAPS THROUGH THE PORTAL AND IS GONE.\nKALA: Now what’s this plan you’ve got in mind?\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: First, I’ll take a sample of — [coral]\nAUTUMN: RUNS IN WEARING A SURVIVAL SUIT.\nAUTUMN: Has Adric gone?\nKALA: Autumn, what are you doing in that suit?\nAUTUMN: (PUTS ON HELMET) I’m going with Adric!\nKALA: You are not!\nAUTUMN: (HELMET DISTORT) Sorry, Mother! I have to!\nDOCTOR: Autumn! No!\nAUTUMN LEAPS THROUGH. CROSS TO: Page 157\nAUTUMN LEAPS THROUGH. CROSS TO: See you soon!\nAUTUMN LEAPS THROUGH.

I’m really glad you came.\nAUTUMN: (BRIGHTLY) Me too.\nAUTUMN: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 163\nNOMAR: We should start back.\nTEGAN: Yeah, enough of the sight-seeing.

MORE SHRIEKS FROM THE KRAIL.\nLOM: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 164\nLOM: THE DOCTOR WORKING ON CONTROLS.\nKALA: So what are you going to do with that piece of coral?\nDOCTOR: Test a theory. The Star Men have an affinity with the coral. They use it for food, for fuel, and as a means to kill and control their victims.\nKALA: So?\nDOCTOR: I think their affinity is at the molecular level. That the Star Men and the red coral have the same base structure.\nKALA: Is it alive? I thought corals were dead - the husks of marine creatures.\nDOCTOR: ‘Coral’ refers to both the substance and the creature that makes it - more properly called a coelenterate [see-LENTER- ate]. All corals are alive. A Star Man may well be the red coral in its ultimate form, transfused with enormous amounts of energy. That’s why the coral responds to technology. It changes its form when exposed to a power source. Like the radiation field from this hand scanner...\nKALA: What are you doing?!\nKALA: THE DOCTOR SWITCHES ON THE SCANNER AND IT BUZZES. THE RED CORAL CRACKS AND BECOMES GASEOUS, HISSING.\nDOCTOR: Energised, it becomes gaseous. On the other hand, when you cool it.. (HEFTS CYLINDER, AND...)\nDOCTOR: . HE FIRES A JET OF VAPOUR AT THE CORAL. STINGING HISS AS CORAL HARDENS TO A SOLID.\nKALA: It turns back to solid form.\nDOCTOR: Becomes inert, exactly. One burst of coolant took the energy out of it.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 165\nKALA: Then the Star Men can be stopped!\nDOCTOR: Star Men thrive on the energy and heat of a star. It makes sense the opposite should be anathema to them.\nKALA: We use cylinders of liquid nitrogen here, in our astronomy packet launchers. D’you think we can use them as a weapon against the Star Men?\nDOCTOR: I think exactly that.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 166\nTHREE: STAR MEN FIRE ENERGY ROUNDS AT THE TARDIS.\nROVUS: Enough!\nFIRING: STOPS.\nROVUS: The box is not even marked.

KRAIL SHRIEKS AND FALLS DEAD.\nADRIC: Autumn? — Autumn, I’ve got you! (HE LIFTS HER)\nADRIC: CARRIES HER INTO THE SHIP. RAMP CLOSES.\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL)\nADRIC: CARRIES AUTUMN IN.\nADRIC: Clear a space! Autumn’s hurt!\nTEGAN: She’s been spiked!\nNYSSA: Page 176\nNYSSA: Adric. We’ll take care of her. You need to get us away from\nNYSSA: here.\nADRIC: (DISTRAUGHT) Yes... yes, alright.\nADRIC: HE RUNS TO COCKPIT.\nTEGAN: Autumn? — Autumn, can you hear me?\nAUTUMN: (DYING) Adric...?\nKRAIL: SHRIEK DEFIANTLY AS THE ASSAULT SHIP LIFTS\nKRAIL: AWAY.\nOFF: AND\nSOARS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 177\nSTAR: MEN CONTINUE THEIR SEARCH.\nDOCTOR: Can’t find what you’re looking for?\nROVUS: Enough of this.\nROVUS: GRABS KALA ROUGHLY.\nKALA: (CRIES OUT) Aah! Doctor!\nROVUS: My patience has ended. Tell me what you have done, or I will snap the Controller’s neck.\nDOCTOR: Now, Rovus...\nSTAR MAN: (NEARBY) Imperator! It is here!\nROVUS: Where? Ah, I see... Liquid nitrogen. Very clever. Disable the device.\nROVUS: THE STAR MAN MAKES A SHIMMERING HAND GESTURE. THE VALVE CONTROL SPARKS AND EXPLODES.\nDOCTOR: (DEFLATED) It was worth a try.\nROVUS: No, it was not. I said my patience was at an end. We are going to your time ship. And you will open it. Or you and every human here will die.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 178\nROVUS: IN FLIGHT. ADRIC LOCKS OFF CONTROLS. TEGAN AND NOMAR ENTER.\nTEGAN: Adric.. You'd better go back there. Autumn wants you.\nNOMAR: I will monitor the flight.\nADRIC: Thank you.\nADRIC: HE EXITS, INTO:\nAUTUMN: (MOANS, NEAR DEATH) Adric... ?\nADRIC: HURRIES TO HER SIDE.\nADRIC: I’m here.\nNYSSA: I’ll.. I’11l go up front and keep Tegan company.\nNYSSA: EXITS.\nADRIC: Autumn, we’1ll get you home. You’1l be alright. You’1l see.\nAUTUMN: Adric, I know.. I’m not going to make it...\nADRIC: Yes you are!\nAUTUMN: I’m glad... I came, though. Glad I helped... your friends. Tell my mother... Tell her...\nADRIC: Tell her what? Autumn? What do I tell her?!\nAUTUMN: Goodbye... Adric. (SHE DIES)\nADRIC: Autumn? .. Autumn! (HE HUGS HER CLOSE)\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 179\nTEGAN: Nomar — what’s that? On the screen?\nNOMAR: That’s the view behind us.\nTEGAN: I’ve never seen so many... are they ships?\nNOMAR: The ships of the Star Men. Each looks like their Citadel.\nNYSSA: That planet’s very close... if it is a planet. It’s moving with them!\nTEGAN: That’s no planet. It’s what Lom mentioned. The Keltin Core, it’s got to be!\nNYSSA: The what?\nTEGAN: The Star Men’s brain. Their mother, too, from what I could make out.\nNOMAR: They are following our course. They’re heading for the rift.\nTEGAN: It’s the invasion! They’re going through, taking this Core with them.\nNYSSA: We have to do something.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, there are thousands of ships out there. What can we do?\nNYSSA: I don’t know... Close the rift before they get there?\nNYSSA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 180\nSTAR: MEN GROUPED AROUND. ROVUS BANGS ON THE TARDIS DOORS.\nROVUS: No more tricks, Doctor! No more refusals! Open your ship, or die where you stand!\nDOCTOR: If you kill me you won’t ever get in, Rovus.\nROVUS: I will take that chance.\nROVUS: HE GRABS KALA BY THE NECK.\nDOCTOR: Put her down!\nKALA: (STRUGGLING IN ROVUS’S GRIP) Can’t.. breathe. Doctor...\nROVUS: Open it. Say no and she dies. Then you die. Then the killing won’t stop.\nROVUS: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 181\nNYSSA: We'll be going through the rift any minute. If we’re going to do something, it has to be now.\nTEGAN: This is a fighting ship, right? It has weapons on it...\nNOMAR: TAPS A KEYBOARD. WORDS SCROLL ON SCREEN.\nNOMAR: The weapons inventory includes space mines. The control for\nNOMAR: their release is... there. Those switches.\nTEGAN: That could work. If we release them as we go through.\nSHIP: SHUDDERS.\nNYSSA: It feels like we’re going through the rift now! Do it, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Here goes nothing.\nTEGAN: PRESSES A ROW OF SWITCHES. MINES ARE RELEASED WITH EXTENDED PINGS.\nTEGAN: THE RIFT, BURNING IN SPACE. SEVERAL SPACE MINES DRIFTING IN THE OPENING, PINGING.\nTEGAN: THE FIRST STAR MEN SHIPS LUMBER TOWARDS THE RIFT.\nHUGE: EXPLOSIONS. DESTROYING THE FIRST OF THE SHIPS, AND COLLAPSING THE RIFT.\nHUGE: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 182\nHUGE: AS BEFORE.\nDOCTOR: Rovus, don’t do — [this]\nROVUS: Wrong response, Doctor. Say goodbye to- (STOPS, STAGGERS) What?.. What is this?\nROVUS: ROVUS’S BODY STUTTERS. SHIMMER BECOMING A CRACKLE OF DISCHARGED POWER.\nROVUS: AROUND THE ROOM, STAR MEN ARE DOING THE SAME.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. You and your Star Men appear to be going to pieces, Rovus. I wonder why?\nROVUS: Doctor! What have you done?!\nDOCTOR: Not me, Rovus. Perhaps some friends of mine? You met them, remember?\nROVUS: RELEASES KALA.\nDOCTOR: Kala, are you alright?\nKALA: Just about... what’s happening?\nROVUS: The Core... is gone! The link is broken!\nKALA: The Core? What’s the Core?\nDOCTOR: He mentioned the Keltin Core. It sounds like something the Star Men can’t bear to be without. Literally. And if the rift were to be closed somehow...\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 183\nKALA: Like you said — with a large explosion?\nDOCTOR: Or explosions, plural.\nDOCTOR: ROVUS’S FORM HARDENING, LIKE CORAL.\nROVUS: No! No, this cannot beeeee... (SUCCUMBS )\nROVUS: ROVUS AND THE STAR MEN HAVE BECOME PILLARS OF BRITTLE STUFF\nTHAT: NOW CRUMBLE TO THE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: (DOWNBEAT) Crumbled to dust. An interesting reaction.\nKALA: Doctor, you should be pleased. Adric and Autumn beat them -\nKALA: we’ve won! The Star Men have gone forever.\nDOCTOR: But Nyssa and Tegan were still on the other side of the rift.\nKALA: You don’t mean...?\nDOCTOR: I’ve lost them, Kala. They’ve gone.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 184\nACTIVITY: AS OPERATORS WORK BUSILY AT STATIONS. MUCH MOVEMENT TO AND FRO.\nDOCTOR: The clear-up seems to be going well.\nKALA: I’m still waiting for final reports. But it looks like we got through this with few casualties in the Hubs.\nDOCTOR: But not elsewhere.\nKALA: Including your two friends. I’m sorry for your loss.\nDOCTOR: Where’s Adric? We’ve still not heard from him, I suppose?\nKALA: He'll be back. He’s got Autumn with him. She’s a Tace. She’s a survivor.\nCOMMC: CHANNEL OPENS WITH A BURST OF STATIC.\nTEGAN: (DISTORT) — again, can anybody hear me?!\nDOCTOR: (DISBELIEVING) Tegan?!\nDOCTOR: HE PRESSES A COMMS BUTTON.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, hello!! Yes, we hear you!\nTEGAN: (D) Doctor! I thought I’d never hear your voice again!\nDOCTOR: Same here. Is Nyssa with you?\nNYSSA: (D) I’m here, Doctor. We’re safe, we just left the L.M.C. Adric and Autumn got us back.\nKALA: (ASIDE) Told you. A survivor.\nKALA: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 185\nDOCTOR: They did more than that, I think. Wonderful work, Adric! (KINDLY) You ignored my instructions, of course. But that’s only to be expected.\nADRIC: (D) (SUBDUED) We’re heading back. But we’ve only got ion drive.\nDOCTOR: I’ll bring the TARDIS to you.\nKALA: Is Autumn there? Autumn, can you hear me? I’m so proud of you! . Autumn?\nNYSSA: (D) Controller Tace, I have to tell you something.\nKALA: Tell me what? Put Autumn on. (AWFUL TRUTH DAWNING) Where’s\nKALA: Autumn?\nTEGAN: (D) Kala.. Autumn didn’t make it.\nKALA: What?\nDOCTOR: Oh Kala. I’m so terribly sorry.\nDOCTOR: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 186\nDOCTOR: ENTERS. DOORS CLOSE.\nSUBDUED: ATMOSPHERE FROM THE START.\nTEGAN: Nomar was glad to be back with his people.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And now we should be on our way.\nDOCTOR: HE OPERATES CONTROLS. TARDIS DOORS CLOSE.\nDOCTOR: The good news is that we stopped the Star Men before they could do serious damage to the timeline. Although mankind and others in this galaxy may explore more tentatively from now on.\nADRIC: Autumn would still be alive if the Star Men hadn’t have come here.\nTEGAN: Adric...\nDOCTOR: That’s true. But her death is part of established history now.\nADRIC: Yes, except this is a time machine.\nNYSSA: Adric, you know the rules.\nDOCTOR: Autumn’s death was tragic. And the Star Men killed many more, including among Nomar’s people. But what’s done cannot be undone. I’d like nothing more than to put things right for you, Adric. But...\nADRIC: But a death is a death.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nADRIC: I’1l be in my room.\nADRIC: #221: THE STAR MEN by Andrew Smith (FINAL) Page 187\nSTIFLING: EMOTION, HE HURRIES OUT, SHUTTING THE INTERNAL DOOR\nBEHIND: HIM.\nTEGAN: Poor guy.\nNYSSA: Poor Autumn.\nDOCTOR: (HEAVY SIGH) Indeed.\nDOCTOR: HE PUSHES A SWITCH. TARDIS ENGINES START.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
