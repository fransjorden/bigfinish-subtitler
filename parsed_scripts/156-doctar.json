The Sergeant tells me you have some information for us.\nJARED: Yeah, that’s right. That thing that came down last night, that wasn’t all of it. There was an escape capsule. I can show you.\nFINCH: Was the escape capsule occupied? Answer!\nJARED: Yeah, there was a bloke inside it. Guy called the Doctor.\nFINCH: The Doctor? You have located the Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6. INT. FLIP’S SPARE BEDROOM.\nFLIP: So go on, then. Tell me what you’re doing here.\nDOCTOR: I am being hunted by some enemies of mine. They would have exterminated me already, had I not managed to escape by stealing one of their ships. But as I was about to make the dimensional jump, they managed to hit the ship with a warp missile, destroying the engines.\nFLIP: Right. Hence the whole crash thing.\nDOCTOR: What concerns me is that my enemies will have pursued me through time. They are disinclined to give up the chase.\nFLIP: No?\nDOCTOR: And when they fail to discover my body in the wreckage of the ship, they will certainly come looking for me.\nFLIP: Oh. Right.\nDOCTOR: You cannot tell anybody I am here. (BEAT, SUDDENLY HARSHER) Nobody knows I am here, do they?\nFLIP: Of course not. Well, nobody except for Jared. And he wouldn’t tell anyone. (UNCERTAIN) I’m sure he wouldn’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. EXT. WASTEGROUND.\nFINCH: Your ‘girlfriend’ took the Doctor back to her residence?\nJARED: Yeah. She was worried that you might want to stick probes in him, but you probably know the Doctor better than we do, right?\nFINCH: You have made the correct decision. The Doctor is well known to us. What is the exact location of this residence?\nJARED: Thamesmead Flats, Number Fifty-One.\nFINCH: Thank you, Jared Rahman. You have done your duty.\nJARED: No problem, mate, you’re welcome. No chance of a reward is there?\nFINCH: A reward? No. But before you go, there is one more thing you can do...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. FLIP’S KITCHEN.\nDOCTOR: We have to move. It is not safe\nDOCTOR: for too long.\nFLIP: But no-one knows you’re here.\nDOCTOR: Jonathan Morris Page 15\nDOCTOR: for me to remain in one place\nDOCTOR: They have other ways of locating me, given time.\nFLIP: ‘They’?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks.\nFLIP: The ‘Daleks’?\nDOCTOR: Tell me, how long has it been since you found me?\nFLIP: It’s just gone eleven, so about\nDOCTOR: ten hours.\nDOCTOR: Then they will already be on Earth.\nFLIP: Okay. Now you’re scaring me.\nDOCTOR: Good. You should be scared. We have to leave. Now.\nFLIP: ‘We’? You want me to come with you?\nDOCTOR: You can stay if you wish. But if the Daleks believe you have had any contact with me, they will kill you.\nFLIP: Remind me never to ask for an exciting life ever again.\nDOCTOR: Who is that?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 16\nFLIP: Must be Jared. He’s always having trouble with his key. Wait here, I'll let him in.\nFLIP: Jared, I thought you said you were meeting Dodgy Steve.\nJARED: (HAS EDGE TO HIS VOICE, HOSTILE, ANXIOUS, BITTER) Philippa Jackson?\nFLIP: What?\nJARED: Identify. You are Philippa Jackson?\nFLIP: I know I am, I’ve got it written on a name badge and everything. Are you alright, Jared ? You look like you’ve got a fever.\nJARED: Where is the Doctor?\nFLIP: He’s in the kitchen. (CALLS) Doctor, I was right, it’s only Jared.\nDOCTOR: You must be Flip’s ‘boyfriend’, the one who helped me last\nDOCTOR: night.\nJARED: You are the Doctor?\nFLIP: Of course he is, you gone stupid or something?\nJARED: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks. He must be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: What?\nFLIP: Jared, what’s got into you?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 17\nJARED: (INCREASING HYSTERIA) Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: I think I know what has got into him.. Look out, girl!!!\nFLIP: What’s that, an egg-whisk?\nFLIP: Okay, not an egg-whisk.\nDOCTOR: Quick, over here! Unless you want to die!\nJARED: Exterminate!\nJARED: (FX: DALEK GUN FIRES. FLIP AND DOCTOR LEAVE KITCHEN, SLAMMING DOOR AFTER THEM)\nFLIP: He blew up my cooker! With a laser beam! What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: There is no time to explain, we have to get out of here!\nFLIP: Alright, alright! I don’t need telling twice!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9. EXT. FLATS.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND FLIP RUNNING OUT OF BUILDING, JARED CHASING AND FIRING DALEK GUN AFTER THEM. HE THROWS OPEN DOORS)\nJARED: The Doctor must be exterminated!\nFLIP: Oh my G[od] — (ANGRY) That was my flat!\nDOCTOR: It is not important.\nFLIP: My flat just exploded and you say it’s not important!\nDOCTOR: You were using a combustible gas as fuel, what did you expect? Listen to me. Do you have a vehicle?\nFLIP: A car, you mean? No, I never passed my test.\nDOCTOR: Then we have no choice. We have to run! Run!\nJARED: The Doctor must be exterminated!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. EXT. STREET.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR AND FLIP RUNNING TOWARDS US. JARED FIRING IN DISTANCE, GETTING FURTHER AWAY)\nFLIP: Quick, Doctor, through here, in the lock-up!\nFLIP: (FX: METAL DOOR OPENED, THEY SLIP INSIDE, DOOR CLOSED. JARED’S FIRING GETS MORE DISTANT THEN STOPS)\nDOCTOR: Fortunately for us he does not know the area as well as you do.\nFLIP: But Jared was brought up on this estate.\nDOCTOR: (SOFTER, MORE CHARMING AGAIN) Yes, but the person who is chasing us is no longer Jared.\nFLIP: Yeah, talk in riddles, Doctor, that’s really helpful.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks have developed the technology to allow them to exchange their minds with those of other sentient beings.\nFLIP: You mean, Jared’s walking around with a Dalek inside his head?\nDOCTOR: He has the consciousness of a Dalek, yes.\nFLIP: Then what’s happened to Jared’s mind?\nDOCTOR: When they transferred the Dalek mind into his body, his mind would have been transferred into that of a Dalek.\nFLIP: You mean he’s still alive? Somewhere?\nDOCTOR: Yes. On board the Dalek pursuit ship. But trapped in the body of a Dalek.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. EXT. STREET.\nJARED: The humans have escaped. I have failed.\nJARED: (FX: HE HAS A TELEPATHIC/RADIO LINK TO A DALEK, WHICH HE CAN HEAR IN HIS HEAD, IT HAS ECHO/SHORT WAVE DISTORTION)\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) More mind-exchanged humans will be despatched into the locality. The Doctor must be located!\nJARED: He is with a human female. Designation Philippa Jackson.\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) Any associate of the Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks. She must be located and exterminated.\nJARED: I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12. EXT. ALLEY.\nFLIP: But how did the Daleks manage to find Jared? And how did they know he had something to do with you?\nDOCTOR: I imagine he tried to report my presence to the authorities.\nFLIP: Oh, yeah. He did say he we should tell the police... That’s Jared for you. Never listens to a word I say.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks will be sending more mind-exchanged humans into the area.\nFLIP: You mean, more people walking around with Dalek brains?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I expect they have gained control of all the civil and military authorities by now.\nFLIP: Oh great. So we’re on our own, then?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPS) Unless you know of anyone else we can turn to?\nFLIP: No. We’re going to need money, though. I’ve only got about five quid. All my cards and stuff were in my flat, and — and Jared -\nDOCTOR: (CHARMING AGAIN) I am sorry, my dear, that you had to become involved in this.\nFLIP: (RECOVERS) No, don’t be, it’s not your fault. Oh hell. I suppose I’m going to have to move back in with mum and creepy Nigel.\nDOCTOR: Or you could come with me.\nFLIP: I thought you’d never ask. So we get out of here, and then what?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 22\nDOCTOR: We have to get off this planet because, very soon, the Daleks will start taking human hostages and exterminating them until I give myself up.\nFLIP: Get off this planet? And how do we do that?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks have my TARDIS, so we have only one option.\nFLIP: Which is?\nDOCTOR: We have to find the Daleks’ pursuit ship and steal it!\nFLIP: Isn’t that like incredibly dangerous?\nDOCTOR: Which is why it will be the last thing they would expect us to do.\nFLIP: You know what, Doctor? Sometimes you are utterly brilliant!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. INT. BUS.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WE HEAR THE BUS APPROACH, THEN INSIDE IT. THE DOCTOR IS REWIRING A MOBILE PHONE)\nFLIP: Hey, I’ve got a phone just like that.\nDOCTOR: No, this is your phone. I took it from your apartment, I hope you do not mind, but I needed to adapt it for my purposes.\nFLIP: No, that’s okay. So long it still works when you’re done.\nDOCTOR: I am afraid that is very unlikely.\nFLIP: Oh, well, I was going to upgrade anyway. What are these purposes you need it for, anyway?\nDOCTOR: To pick up local sub-wave radio signals.\nFLIP: What, like Capital FM?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks have a command network with the mind-exchanged humans. A form of artificial telepathy.\nFLIP: Oh, right. So we can listen in on what they’re up to? On what they’re thinking to each other?\nDOCTOR: Precisely, my dear.\nJARED: (FX: VIA PHONE) Dalek designation Rahman reporting to Dalek command.\nFLIP: Jared!\nDALEK: (FX: VIA PHONE) Dalek command receiving.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 24\nFLIP: Woah, what was that?\nDOCTOR: That is what a Dalek sounds like.\nJARED: (UNDER PREVIOUS TWO LINES OF DIALOGUE, FX: VIA PHONE)\nJARED: I have analysed all transport routes. I believe the Doctor and Philippa have evaded capture by taking a metropolitan bus. Designation One hundred and seventy seven.\nFLIP: Hang on. The one seven seven, that’s this bus!\nDOCTOR: Yes. I knew it would not take them long to find us.\nFLIP: Then we have to get off.\nDOCTOR: Not just yet...\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR ADJUST CONTROLS ON PHONE. IT MAKES A SHRIEKING, WARBLING, HOWL OF FEEDBACK)\nFLIP: Ow, my ears! What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Disrupting the Daleks’ sub-wave frequency...\nDALEK: Interference in command network! Locating source! Locating source!\nFLIP: What?\nDALEK: Source of interference located. Plumstead Road. Moving west.\nFLIP: Doctor! They’ve found us!\nDOCTOR: Of course they have, that was my intention.\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 25\nDOCTOR: Now they are tracking us, I can triangulate the source of their tracking signal.\nFLIP: You mean the Daleks’ space ship? By trying to find out where we are, they’ve given away where they are?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. It is to the south-east, at a distance equivalent to half of one of your Earth miles. (CALLING) Driver. Driver! Stop this vehicle!\nFLIP: You do it like that. Half a mile, you say?\nDOCTOR: It will not take us long. We have to get there before they find thAEsS.\nFLIP: My phone? You’re leaving it behind?\nDOCTOR: So long as the device remains on this vehicle, the Daleks will assume we are as well.\nFLIP: But isn’t that putting the people on this bus in danger?\nDOCTOR: My dear, everyone on this planet is in danger unless I can find a way of getting to that Dalek ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. CAR.\nFINCH: Dalek designation Finch reporting to Dalek command. I have located the source of the interference. It is originating from a metropolitan bus. Now in visual range.\nDALEK: (FX: VIA TELEPATHIC NETWORK, LIKE SCENE 11) The Doctor must be on board. If he attempts to leave, he is to be exterminated.\nFINCH: I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. EXT. OUTSIDE SUPERMARKET.\nFLIP: Hey, that’s Freshgoods supermarket. This is where I work!\nDOCTOR: You work here?\nFLIP: Yeah, on the tills, and sometimes on the cheese counter. But if I go in there now they’1l know I was phoning in sick.\nDOCTOR: I do not think that will be a problem.\nFLIP: What do you mean? Hey, it’s usually more busy than this -\nDOCTOR: (GRABBING HER ARM) Flip. Do not go inside.\nFLIP: What? Why?\nFLIP: Oh no. What’s happened to them?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks got here first.\nFLIP: But all the customers... they must’ve just killed them when they were doing their Sunday shopping.\nDOCTOR: Standard Dalek procedure. Secure the area, neutralise all unnecessary life forms.\nFLIP: What about all the people inside? All the people I work with?\nFLIP: Brian in packing? Angela in the deli? They can’t be dead too?\nDOCTOR: Unless the Daleks have taken them as hostages, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 28\nFLIP: And all this just cos they came here to find you?\nDOCTOR: I am aware of that fact.\nFLIP: I know, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it. So where’s this space ship?\nDOCTOR: Look directly in front of you.\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR: You see where there is a large empty space, where no vehicles are parked?\nFLIP: Yeah, so?\nDOCTOR: That is the Dalek pursuit ship, shielded by a prismatic force field.\nFLIP: You’re kidding [me-]\nDOCTOR: Quick, hide!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DALEK AND JARED EMERGE FROM SUPERMARKET, SUPERMARKET DOORS OPEN)\nDALEK ONE: Dalek designation Rahman. Report. Has the Doctor been located?\nJARED: The device he used to interfere with our command network remains active. We have traced it to a vehicle being followed by Dalek designation Finch.\nFLIP: That was Jared!\nDOCTOR: With the mind of a Dalek, remember. We must not let him see us.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 29\nFLIP: I’m hardly likely to forget, am I? And what the hell was that thing he was with? Some sort of mobile wheelie-bin?\nDOCTOR: That, my dear, was a Dalek.\nFLIP: That’s a Dalek? They’re robots?\nDOCTOR: No. They may look like robots, but they are living creatures. The most ruthless and formidable race of beings the universe has ever known.\nFLIP: Almost sounds like you’re bigging them up.\nDOCTOR: ‘Bigging them [up?’] — (ALARM) Get back under cover!\nJARED: Have you secured the hostages?\nDALEK TWO: Yes. They are held in the food distribution centre. The humans dare not attack while the lives of their fellow creatures are at stake.\nJARED: Show me.\nFLIP: Hear that? There’s still some people in there. I’m going in.\nDOCTOR: Philippa, there’s nothing we can — Philippa, wait! Come back!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. BUS.\nFINCH: Dalek designation Finch reporting to Dalek command.\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) Report!\nFINCH: I have gained access to the metropolitan bus designation one hundred and seventy seven. I have exterminated the vehicle operator and all passengers.\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) Have you located the Doctor and his associate?\nFINCH: They were not present. They must have disembarked before I made visual contact and abandoned the device causing the network interference in order to mislead us.\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) Then they must have known we had detected the device.\nFINCH: Yes. And it has been used to detect the location of our space craft.\nDALEK: (FX: IN HEAD) Then that is where they must be.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. SUPERMARKET.\nDOCTOR: Phillipa! What do you think you are doing?\nFLIP: Didn’t you hear? These dodgem cars from space are holding innocent people hostage. We’ve gotta do something.\nDOCTOR: Such as getting ourselves killed in a futile rescue attempt?\nFLIP: Do you have any better ideas?\nDALEK: (FX: VIA TANNOY ) Doctor. Philippa Jackson. We know you are here.\nFLIP: What?\nDALEK: (FX: VIA TANNOY) Analysis of past behaviour patterns indicates you will have come here to attempt to rescue the human captives.\nFLIP: Sounds like they know you too well, Doctor.\nDALEK: (FX: VIA TANNOY)\nDALEK: We have brought the human captives to the area designated Deli Counter. If you do not surrender immediately we will begin exterminating them.\nFLIP: Doctor, we’re gonna have to give ourselves up.\nDOCTOR: Why? So they can exterminate us too?\nFLIP: But if you don’t, they’re gonna kill all those people.\nDOCTOR: They are going to die whatever we do.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 32\nDALEK: Bring the first captive forward.\nSHOPPER: No! No! Please!\nDALEK: Exterminate!\nFLIP: I can’t just stand here and watch this. (BEAT) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nFLIP: You get to the Dalek ship. I’m gonna buy you some time.\nDOCTOR: But I told you —\nFLIP: I don’t care. Just go!\nDALEK: Bring the next captive forward.\nFLIP: No. Stop!\nDALEK: You are Philippa Jackson.\nFLIP: Yeah, what if I am? You got a problem with that?\nDALEK: You are an associate of the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris\nFLIP: If you say so.\nDALEK: Answer!\nFLIP: Yes, all right, yes, I\nDALEK: Where is the Doctor?\nFLIP: You think I’m going to\nDALEK: am.\nDALEK: tell you that?\nDALEK: Page 33\nDALEK: If you do not give us the location of the Doctor, you will be\nDALEK: exterminated.\nFLIP: Well, you’ll have to exterminate me then, won’t you? And then\nFLIP: you’1ll never find out.\nDALEK: Unless you give us the location of the Doctor, we shall exterminate the remaining humans. Answer. Answer. Answer!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. INT. DALEK SHIP ENTRANCE.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR PRESSING BUTTONS ON CONTROL PANEL. DOOR OPENS.

WHERE THE DALEKS ARE STORING THE HUMAN MINDS INSIDE INERT DALEKS — IE. THEY HAVE DALEK VOICES)\nJARED DALEK: There’s someone here. I can hear him.\nFINCH DALEK: Who are you? You have to help us.\nJARED DALEK: Where are we? What has happened to us?\nJARED DALEK: (FX: OTHER DALEKS BEGIN TO CHORUS ‘HELP US’ ‘WHERE ARE WE?’ ‘WHY CAN’T I SEE?’ ‘WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US?’ ‘MOTHER?’ )\nDOCTOR: Silence, all of you! Do you wish for me to be discovered?\nJARED: Do not move. Do not move!\nDOCTOR: So. The Daleks had the intelligence to leave someone on guard.\nJARED: Analysis of past behaviour patterns indicated you would attempt to gain access to our ship.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. You do not understand what you are doing.\nJARED: I understand, Doctor. You are an enemy of the Daleks. You must be exterminated!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. INT. SUPERMARKET.\nDALEK ONE: Dalek designation Rahman reports. He has captured the Doctor\nDALEK ONE: attempting to break into the pursuit ship.\nFLIP: What? And it was all going so well!\nDALEK TWO: Then we have no need of the human captives. Exterminate them.\nDALEK ONE: I obey.\nFLIP: No, you can’t. You can’t. They’re just innocent people -\nFLIP: They weren’t any threat to you!\nDALEK ONE: Silence, or we will exterminate you! Now. Move! Move! Move!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. INT. DALEK SHIP CONTROL ROOM.\nFLIP: Doctor. They killed all the hostages, they killed them all!\nDOCTOR: I know, Philippa. I did everything I could.\nFLIP: It’s alright, Doctor, I know it wasn’t your fault.\nDALEK: Prepare to exterminate the prisoners.\nDALEK: FINCH & JARED & OTHER HUMANS, MALE AND FEMALE: We obey.\nDOCTOR: Wait! There is something of vital importance I have to tell you.\nDALEK: Speak!\nDOCTOR: Contact your Emperor. Tell him you have one of my associates as your prisoner. That way you are assured of my co-operation.\nDALEK: You offer us your co-operation?\nDOCTOR: The Emperor knows me. He knows that I will do anything to prevent one of my associates being killed. So all you have to do is to threaten her life and I will have no choice but to obey.\nFLIP: Thanks. I think.\nDALEK: We shall contact the Emperor. Opening trans-temporal command network.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT.

They are to be exterminated.\nDAVROS: No. Wait!\nSUPREME DALEK: Emperor?\nDAVROS: I want both the Doctor and the human female kept alive.\nSUPREME DALEK: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.

I told him about the Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 41\nFLIP: It doesn’t matter. Just next time, do as you’re told, okay? So what was it like, being a Dalek?\nJARED: I couldn’t see anything, and when I tried to move, it was like I was strapped down. And there was this smell, like antiseptic, and this taste in my mouth like I’d just been sick.\nFLIP: Oh god, ugh.\nJARED: But that wasn’t the worst of it. The worst thing was the pain. It felt like every part of me was on fire. And I felt... disgusted. Revolted. And angry. So angry.\nFLIP: Angry?\nJARED: Yeah. Like I could scream. You know like when you’re a kid, you have a temper tantrum? It felt like that, but all the time.\nDALEK ONE: (FX: OVER TANNOY )\nDALEK ONE: Commencing countdown to temporal jump. Five. Four. Three.

I want the Doctor and the human female brought to me the moment the ship lands.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDAVROS: On no account must either of them be harmed, do you understand me? No matter what.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDAVROS: So, ‘Doctor’. You’ve found an ‘associate’ to hide behind. The act of a true coward. I should have expected nothing less!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25. INT. DALEK CELL.\nFLIP: We’ve travelled in time?\nDOCTOR: I would not have thought that would come as a surprise to you. Have you not travelled in time with me before?\nFLIP: Er, no.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, of course, sorry, I am getting you confused with someone else. It is so difficult to keep track...\nFLIP: Thanks a lot!\nJARED: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Accessing the cell door’s electrostatic over-ride. All Dalek space ships have them.\nJARED: You know an awful lot about these Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Well, I have encountered them a considerable number of times before. In fact they consider me their greatest enemy. Ah-ha!\nFLIP: Blimey, you did it. You must be some sort of genius.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Quick! Before the ship lands.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THEY HEAD OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR, HUM OF ENGINES/POWER LOUDER HERE.

That was my head!\nFLIP: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: Good, then we have to get out of here before the Daleks realise we have escaped.\nJARED: Er, you say get out of here, but where is here?\nFLIP: Some sort of cornfield. More to the point, when?\nJARED: When?\nFLIP: We've travelled in time. That’s why it’s the middle of the night.\nDOCTOR: There is no time for idle chatter. Come on!\nJARED: All right. Cor, he’s a bit shirty, isn’t he?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27. INT. DALEK CONTROL ROOM.\nSUPREME DALEK: Emperor!\nDAVROS: Why do you dare to interrupt my solitude?\nSUPREME DALEK: The Dalek pursuit ship reports that the Doctor and his human associates have escaped.\nDAVROS: What?\nSUPREME DALEK: The Doctor managed to access the electrostatic over-ride.\nDAVROS: You fools, you should have placed him under Dalek guard! Did you think a door would prove an obstacle to the Doctor’s genius?\nSUPREME DALEK: We shall investigate. It should be impossible for any non-Dalek to open — [the]\nDAVROS: Don’t waste time finding out how he escaped.

Flip, are you alright?\nFLIP: Well, I’m soaked through, freezing cold, my shoes are full of mud, but apart from that, this is a top night out.\nJARED: There’s some sort of track up ahead... and lights...\nJARED: (THE BOOTSTEPS OF AN INFANTRY BATTALION MAKING THEIR WAY DOWN THE LANE TOWARDS US. A BAND PLAYS ‘LE VICTOIRE EST A NOUS’ AT 120 BPM. HORSES ALSO SNORT AS THEY DRAG CANNONS BEHIND THEM)\nFLIP: Woah. Soldiers. In some sort of medieval get-up.\nJARED: That’s not medieval. They’ve got muskets and bayonets, that’s nineteenth century.\nFLIP: Sorry, forgive me for not being Simon Schwarma. Whoa. There must be thousands of them.\nDOCTOR: Keep your head down!\nFLIP: Don’t look too happy, do they? But then who would, marching in this weather. I like their hats.\nPASCAL: (SPOTS THEM) Halt! Who goes there!\nJARED: Oh, great.\nDOCTOR: I told you to keep your head down...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 48\nPASCAL: Step forward with your hands up! If you try anything, you will be shot!\nBOUVIER: Let us shoot them now, they are clearly spies, Captain.\nPASCAL: I shall be the judge of that, Corporal Bouvier. Hold the lamp, let me see them. (BEAT) Hmmm. If they are spies then they are not very well disguised!\nFLIP: We’re not spies!\nPASCAL: A girl! And a pretty one too. Has one of the Imperial Guards brought along his mistress to give him comfort in the night?\nFLIP: Yeah, very funny, you’re the next Jimmy Carr.\nDOCTOR: We are simply civilians, we got.. disorientated in the dark.\nPASCAL: Really? I should have thought all civilians would have fled the region hours ago.\nBOUVIER: Captain Pascal, we should just kill them and go. We’re still a kilometre from Plancenoit, and the men have been marching for twelve hours, without food or rest.\nPASCAL: I am well aware of our predicament, Corporal. But three citizens hardly pose a threat to the French army.\nPASCAL: (FX: SOLDIERS LAUGH. IN THE B/G, SOLDIERS CONTINUE TO MARCH PAST. THE BAND NOW PLAYING THE MARSEILLES )\nFLIP: Sorry? You’re the French army?\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Flip!\nPASCAL: How could you not know that? I mean, I’ve heard tell of the backwardness of Walloon peasant folk, but...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 49\nFLIP: But if you’re French, why are you all speaking English?\nDOCTOR: Philippa! Be quiet!\nPASCAL: I am sorry. I am not. I am speaking French.\nFLIP: No, French is like ‘hong-i-hong-i-hong’. You’re speaking English, just like me.\nPASCAL: You just said that in French.\nFLIP: No way. I’m rubbish at French, the school wouldn’t even enter me for the GCSE.\nPASCAL: This makes no sense. Why would you believe you are speaking English, when you are not?\nFLIP: Because I am English — (REALISES) Oh. Shouldn’t have said that.\nPASCAL: It seems you were right, Corporal. We have spies in our midst! But if this is the best the seventh coalition can muster, we have little to fear!\nBOUVIER: Shall I have the men run them through, Captain?\nPASCAL: No. We shall take them to the encampment at Plancenoit. Let them enjoy some of our famous French hospitality!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. INT. TENT.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: STORM STILL RAGING OUTSIDE.

Now we’ve been captured by the French army. I don’t think I’m ever going to live this down.\nFLIP: Jared, could you do something other than moan for once? This is history, we're in history, and we’re taking part in it. Is there any way in which that isn’t brilliant?\nJARED: Says the girl who got us caught.\nFLIP: How was I supposed to know I could suddenly speak French?\nDOCTOR: A Time Lord gift. While you are with me you have the ability to converse in any language.\nJARED: Pity you didn’t mention that before.\nFLIP: Yeah, it would’ve been handy for my GCSE too.\nJARED: But where are we? And when?\nFLIP: The French Captain mentioned Walloon, where’s that?\nDOCTOR: Wallonia, the southern part of Belgium. And as for the date? The early hours of the morning of the eighteenth of June, 1815.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 51\nJARED: 1815? So I was right about nineteenth century? Result.\nFLIP: Sorry, am I being thick, but what are the Daleks, aliens from Space, doing in Belgium in 1815?\nDOCTOR: Does that date not mean anything to you?\nFLIP: No. Should it?\nDOCTOR: This is a date where the future of the human race hangs in the balance. The Daleks are determined to change the course of history.\nFLIP: Right. So we’ve gotta stop them!\nJARED: Cool. You do that. But first there’s the slight problem of being stuck in the middle of the French camp —\nPASCAL: You, the mad girl who thinks she speaks English. Out.\nFLIP: Excuse me?\nPASCAL: You are to be taken for interrogation.\nJARED: Hey, listen mate —\nPASCAL: Do not worry. Your turn will come soon enough!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30. INT. FARMHOUSE.\nPASCAL: Your imperial majesty.

You may remain outside.\nPASCAL: Yes, sire. Vive 1’Empereur!\nFLIP: The Emperor? You’re the Emperor? No, really?\nBONAPARTE: Please, sit down my dear. Feel free to dry yourself by the fire. I can have fresh clothes brought for you, if you wish?\nFLIP: No, I’m good as I am, thanks. Nice farmhouse you’ve got here.\nBONAPARTE: It serves its purpose. May I offer you some wine?\nFLIP: I thought you wanted to interrogate me, not chat me up? Wow,\nFLIP: you are so French!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 53\nBONAPARTE: I do wish to ask you a few questions, yes. But there is no need for us to be uncivilised.\nFLIP: I suppose I should be honoured. An Emperor who does his own questioning. You should learn to delegate, mate.\nBONAPARTE: Perhaps I should. May I say, this is rather a novel experience for me too. To meet someone who is not quaking with fear to be in my presence.\nFLIP: Think a lot of yourself, don’t you? Who are you, anyway?\nBONAPARTE: You don’t know who I am?\nFLIP: Er, would I ask if I knew?\nBONAPARTE: My dear. I am the Emperor Bonaparte.\nFLIP: No way! NO WAY!\nBONAPARTE: I can assure you that I am.\nFLIP: You’re not. You can’t be.\nBONAPARTE: And why’s that?\nFLIP: Well, for a start. I thought you were supposed to be a little short guy, with a big hat.\nBONAPARTE: Ha! Next you’ll be asking me why I don’t have my right hand tucked inside my waistcoat!\nFLIP: You really are him, aren’t you? You’re Napoleon!\nBONAPARTE: Now that is interesting, my dear. Because nobody would ever dare call me by that name to my face.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 54\nFLIP: What, Napoleon? But that’s your name!\nBONAPARTE: It may be my name, my dear, but to my citizens I am known as the Emperor Bonaparte. And nothing else.\nFLIP: Sorry. I didn’t mean to disrespect you.\nBONAPARTE: No, of course not, because you didn’t know any better. Tell me, what else do you know of me?\nFLIP: Sorry, what?\nBONAPARTE: My dear, I am the greatest man alive, feted and feared across the globe. So tell me. How do they speak of me, in the future?\nFLIP: Sorry. What?\nBONAPARTE: Don’t play games, my dear. I know you are from another time.\nFLIP: But how could you know that?\nBONAPARTE: Oh, it was not difficult to guess. Your clothes, your manner. And besides, your arrival was not unexpected.\nFLIP: No?\nBONAPARTE: You haven’t answered my question. How am I regarded in the future?\nFLIP: Well, I didn’t really do history. But you introduced the metric system, I do know that, that was good —\nBONAPARTE: And that is all? Nothing else?\nFLIP: Not really, no, sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 55\nBONAPARTE: Let me be more precise. What do you know of Waterloo?\nFLIP: The Battle of Waterloo?\nBONAPARTE: Yes.\nFLIP: (SPOKEN NOT SUNG) Well, um, I know that at Waterloo... Napoleon did surrender.\nBONAPARTE: And who told you that, may I ask?\nFLIP: Abba.\nBONAPARTE: Abba?\nFLIP: They made up a song about it. About you. Coming second.\nBONAPARTE: Well, I can assure you, my dear, that I have no intention of surrendering. That is now a future that will be wiped from the pages of history!\nFLIP: Eh? What are you talking about?\nBONAPARTE: Just as one learns from the past, one may also learn from the future. For I have been promised that this day shall be mine!\nFLIP: Promised by who? Oh. Let me guess.\nBONAPARTE: Bonaparte calling Dalek command. The three travellers from the future you asked me to find. I have them as my prisoners.\nSUPREME DALEK: (FX: VIA RADIO) You shall return them to us!\nBONAPARTE: As you desire, my Dalek friend. As you desire!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31. INT. TENT.\nJARED: Doctor, I think someone’s coming.\nDOCTOR: Good. You know what to do?\nBOUVIER: All right you two, outside -\nDOCTOR: Now!\nBOUVIER: (HIT) Ow!\nDOCTOR: Take his pistol.\nJARED: Got it Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now give it to me.\nBOUVIER: If you imagine you can just stroll out of here, you are very much mistaken, Englishman.\nDOCTOR: Which is why you are going to help us.\nBOUVIER: What?\nDOCTOR: You are going to lead us out of here.

The art of war, Marshal Ney, is a matter of being prepared for every eventuality.\nNEY: As your imperial majesty commands. I’m afraid we have yet to ascertain the positions of the allied forces...\nBONAPARTE: Order the artillery to fire along the Mont St Jean ridge. We shall know where they are deployed by where they return fire.\nBONAPARTE: What concerns me is the Prussian army. If they were to arrive before we have defeated the British... then all would be lost.\nNEY: But they are miles away, and after their rout at Ligny, they will need two days to recover, if not more...\nBONAPARTE: Nevertheless, I do not wish for there to be any unwelcome surprises. Send a message to Marshal Grouchy to head them off at the town of Wavre. This is of absolute importance.\nNEY: I shall despatch the message myself, your highness.\nBONAPARTE: Gentlemen! Tell me, do you know what a battle is? Between a battle lost and a battle won runs the whole thread of history. Battles decide the fates of empires, kingdoms, of the world itself. In a few hours, we fight for nothing less than the future of mankind!

Halt!\nBOUVIER: Yes, sir.\nFLIP: Hey, Doctor. You’1ll never believe who I’ve just met!\nDOCTOR: Philippa, it will have to wait.\nFLIP: But!\nPASCAL: Corporal Bouvier. You received the Emperor’s order to transfer the prisoners to the Chateau, I see.\nBOUVIER: I did, sir.\nPASCAL: Then why, may I ask, have you decided to escort them\nPASCAL: singlehanded?\nBOUVIER: I, er.. sir, they overpowered me!

I think he’s dead.\nDOCTOR: No, I can assure you, he is just stunned.\nFLIP: He’s bleeding.\nDOCTOR: He will make a full recovery.\nFLIP: You’re sure about that? Because he’s not breathing.\nDOCTOR: There is no time to argue. We have to move. Or we will all be dead.\nPASCAL: You cannot escape. The perimeter guards will have heard the sound of the shot.\nDOCTOR: With the cannons of the Grande Batterie ringing in their ears? I think not.\nJARED: Er, I think you might be wrong about that, Doctor...\nJARED: (FX: SOLDIERS RUNNING TOWARDS THEM, SHOUTING ‘INTRUDERS’, ‘WHO GOES THERE, ‘HALT!’ ETC)\nDOCTOR: We will have to leave the road and cut through Hougemont wood.

Well, before he ran off he shot one of my men. Corporal Bouvier. Who is now dead.\nSUPREME DALEK: (FX: VIA RADIO) That is of no concern. You will order your men to locate the Doctor!\nBONAPARTE: (FX: VIA RADIO) I have no men to spare, Dalek. Or have you forgotten? I have a battle to fight! They’re your prisoners. You find them!\nDAVROS: (AMUSED) If there is one thing humans can be relied upon, it is their unreliability.\nSUPREME DALEK: We should exchange the Emperor Bonaparte’s mind with that of a Dalek. Then he would obey.\nDAVROS: No. Not yet. In the meantime, assign every spare Dalek to locate the Doctor and his associates.\nSUPREME: I obey.\nDAVROS: Good. And place a guard on this chamber.

Seek! Locate!\nFLIP: They’re flying. I didn’t know they could fly. You never said they could fly!\nDOCTOR: How else do you think they could traverse this terrain?\nFLIP: But anyone might see them!\nDOCTOR: No. They are all shielded by a prismatic force field. No-one from this time period will be able to see or hear them.\nFLIP: Oh. Right. Like the Dalek space ship!\nDOCTOR: Exactly.

Some sort of stately home?\nDOCTOR: That is the Chateau Rossome.\nFLIP: So?\nDOCTOR: You will see soon enough. But stay close to me.

Fetch me more strong coffee, and bread! And you — clear the table, we need space for our maps.\nSERVANTS: (MUMBLE) Yes, sire.\nNEY: Judging by the response to the bombardment, the Allied army is deployed along the ridge. There are about two kilometres of open field between us. The ground is soaked, our cavalry will not be able to cross it without being cut down.\nBONAPARTE: Then we shall wait until the ground is dry. There is no hurry. In choosing to defend Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington has led his army into a trap!\nNEY: Nevertheless, the Duke’s reputation —\nBONAPARTE: What reputation? Because you’ve all been defeated by Wellington, you consider him a great general. But I tell you that he is a bad general, and defeating him will be as easy as... as having breakfast!\nNEY: We've just received word from General Grouchy, your highness. He reports he has secured the town of Wavre. Now there is no way the Prussians can come to the aid of the British.\nBONAPARTE: (THOUGHTFUL, TO HIMSELF) In another time, that might have made all the difference.\nNEY: Sire?\nBONAPARTE: Wellington has rolled the dice and they have landed in our favour. We have ninety chances against his ten. He has no room to manoeuvre, no reinforcements, and no chance of escape. Gentlemen. Today will see the British army’s greatest defeat. They will be wiped from the face of the Earth.

This is, in fact, a French chateau which has been constructed around a Dalek mothership.\nFLIP: But that doesn’t make sense. The chateau must be hundreds of years old!\nDOCTOR: It’s perfectly simple, [it] — Quiet!\nFLIP: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Daleks!\nFLIP: They look like they’re looking for something.\nDOCTOR: They are. Us.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. EXT. WOODS\nJARED: Where are you taking me?\nDICKSON: Where do you think? To Mont St Jean. Rather than betraying our positions to the French, you will instead betray your own army’s positions to us.\nJARED: Really? Because I have no idea.\nDICKSON: I hope that is not the case, my French friend. Because that information is the only thing that is keeping you alive.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. INT. CHATEAU.\nFLIP: This place is so weird. Half of it’s like a spaceship, the rest is all chandeliers, mirrors and carpets. I mean, what’s this, some sort of ballroom?\nDOCTOR: It may be a Dalek mothership, but it is also a chateau.\nFLIP: Right, like that makes sense. You seem to know your way round, though. Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: You will not have long to wait. (BEAT) We are expected. Two Daleks on guard duty.\nFLIP: Well you’re hardly gonna get past them with one pistol.\nDOCTOR: No need. Just move aside the tapestry and — yes!\nFLIP: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: An access point for the mothership’s security computer.\nDALEKS: Intruder detected in loading bay. Seek. Locate. Seek!

It seems I have underestimated you.\nDOCTOR: Of course. But then, that is a mistake you keep on making.\nDAVROS: You realise, of course, that at any moment I can summon the Daleks and have you exterminated?\nDOCTOR: Yes. But if you dare to so much as lift a finger, your friend will die.\nFLIP: Sorry, whose friend? What are you talking about?\nDAVROS: You are mistaken. The girl is unknown to me.\nFLIP: Well, of course I am, we’ve never met.\nDOCTOR: An amusing bluff.

You can’t.\nDOCTOR: You do not understand, my dear.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 71\nFLIP: Er, I think I do. This guy’s in a wheelchair. He can’t defend himself. You can’t shoot him. I won’t let you.\nDOCTOR: Flip, move out of the way. This man must die.\nFLIP: No!\nDOCTOR: Move out of the way, girl. That is an order!\nFLIP: An order? Who do you think you are?\nDOCTOR: Who do I think I am? (LAUGHS) Who do you think I am?\nFLIP: I don’t know. But you’re not the Doctor. The Doctor would never\nFLIP: kill someone in cold blood.

I am Davros!\nFLIP: But if you’re Davros, then who’s the guy in the chair?\nDOCTOR: Well? Go on. Tell her. Tell her!\nDAVROS: My dear — I am the Doctor!\nFLIP: You’re the Doctor? But how.. oh. The Dalek mind-swap thing, right?\nDOCTOR: Correct, my dear. The Doctor used it to exchange my body with his.\nFLIP: This was the Doctor’s idea? But why?\nDOCTOR: Well, Doctor? Would you care to answer that?\nDAVROS: (LAUGHS) You think I’m going to blurt out my plans just like that? I’m afraid not, Davros. That’s the sort of thing you’d do.\nDOCTOR: It hardly matters. Now, move out of the way, girl.\nFLIP: Er, no. You’ll have to shoot me.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 73\nDOCTOR: So be it. I only brought you here as security in the first place.\nFLIP: Security?\nDOCTOR: The Doctor will do anything to prevent his associates being killed. In order to keep you alive, he had to keep me alive.\nFLIP: No, still don’t get it.\nDAVROS: You thought you were his companion, when you were his hostage.\nDOCTOR: This is your final warning. Move out of the way, or I will not hesitate to kill you.\nFLIP: But if you kill him, you’1ll never get your own body back.\nDOCTOR: That thing, that withered, rotting husk, that twisted cadaver, that living death? You think I’d want to return to that?\nFLIP: When you put it like that, I suppose not.\nDOCTOR: Now I have the body of a Time Lord. For the first time in centuries, I have no pain. I am alive, more alive than I have ever been. And it is good.\nFLIP: But if you kill the Doctor, won’t the Daleks kill you? For, you know, murdering their Emperor and stuff?\nDOCTOR: I will be able to prove my identity with a brain-scan. You see, my brain pattern is not so very different from that of a Dalek.\nFLIP: So that’s why you could open all their doors so easily!\nDOCTOR: Enough talk. It is time for you to die.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 74\nDALEKS: Halt. Do not move! Do not move!\nDAVROS: Daleks! If the Doctor harms me or the girl, he is to be exterminated at once. You understand me? At once!\nDALEKS: We obey.\nDAVROS: Now, put the weapon down, Doctor. Or I shall have no choice but to let the Daleks exterminate you.\nDOCTOR: I warned you, I will kill the girl.\nDAVROS: And if you do, you will die.\nDOCTOR: Daleks. I am not the Doctor. I am Davros, in the Doctor’s body. The Doctor tricked you, he used the mind exchange!\nDAVROS: (LAUGHS) A transparent ruse, Doctor. Now. Are you going to put the gun down or not?\nDAVROS: Daleks. Take him to the chateau dungeons and lock him up.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nDAVROS: And leave a Dalek in the cell with him. With orders that if he attempts to escape, he is to be exterminated.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nDAVROS: Now. You will leave us. I wish to interrogate the human female in private. On no account are we to be disturbed.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 75\nFLIP: Blimey, that was close.\nDAVROS: Close?\nFLIP: I mean, if the Daleks hadn’t turned up when they did...\nDAVROS: (LAUGHS) The Doctor, rescued by the Daleks.

Mad as it sounds, I was brought here.\nDICKSON: Brought here?\nJARED: Yeah. By the these things called Daleks.\nDICKSON: Sorry, did you say ‘Daleks’?\nJARED: Yeah.

Your intention must be to deceive us.\nDOCTOR: You paranoid fool. You are so frightened of the Doctor you are blind to reason.\nDALEK: Move into the cell. Or we will make you suffer!\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. I am your Emperor. I developed the mind exchange for you. I supervised the first tests on the colonists of the planet Telderan.\nDALEK: This proves nothing. The Doctor could know this.\nDOCTOR: After we tested it on the colony leader, he begged us to return him to his own body. He begged us to take his own daughter instead, to exchange her mind with that of a Dalek. His daughter’s name was Tamora.\nDALEK: Why are you telling me this?\nDOCTOR: Because the Doctor could not know this - because he was not there. Only the Supreme Dalek and myself were in attendance. Please. All I ask is that you verify my story.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nFLIP: So you’re the Doctor?

It’s not as if we spent a great deal of time together. As I recall, we were too concerned with fighting the Terravore.\nFLIP: You remember, then?\nDAVROS: Of course. It was when I travelled with Evelyn.\nFLIP: Yeah, she was cool. What happened to her?\nDAVROS: Evelyn? Oh, she met someone. A chap named Rossiter. She was very happy with him.\nFLIP: So you travel on your own now?\nDAVROS: For the moment, yes. Why do you ask?\nFLIP: Just random interest, making conversation.\nDAVROS: Your friend was brought into this time-zone too, wasn’t he? What was his name? Jared.\nFLIP: Yeah. We lost him in the woods.\nDAVROS: Well, if it’s any comfort, he seems to have avoided the Dalek patrols, nor has he been recaptured by the French.\nFLIP: But then where is he?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. INT. MONT ST JEAN.\nWELLINGTON: (AS THOUGH READING MAPS/REPORTS )\nWELLINGTON: Napoleon knows we dare not make the first move, nor can we withdraw with the Forest of Soignes at our back. He has humbugged me, by God! Captain. Is there any news from Old Blucher?\nDICKSON: No, your grace. The last report said the Prussian army had been ambushed by the French at Wavre.\nWELLINGTON: Ambushed?\nDICKSON: There’s no way they can reach us before the day is out, your grace.\nWELLINGTON: Then we must win or lose this day alone. What about Hougemont?\nDICKSON: French skirmishers have taken the woods, your grace. According to our scouts Napoleon has sent a brigade of light infantry to the secure the area.\nWELLINGTON: So he intends to outflank us. Captain Dickson. Give the order to open fire on the woods with our Howitzers.\nDICKSON: Sir, but that will give away the position of our artillery -\nWELLINGTON: We have no choice! We are here for a battle, captain, so let us have a battle. Up guards and at them!\nMERCER: Yes, your grace.\nWELLINGTON: (SEES NEW ARRIVAL) Well? What are you waiting for?\nDICKSON: This man claims to know about the Daleks, your grace. I thought you may like to question him.\nJARED: Your grace? Hey, don’t I recognise you from somewhere?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 80\nWELLINGTON: As well you should, soldier. I am the Duke of Wellington.\nJARED: The Duke of Wellington! You are seriously the Duke? I’m talking to the Duke of Wellington? That is awesome. Hold on there, I’ve got to get a photo of you.\nWELLINGTON: Here is my offer. Tell us what you know about the Daleks and you will be treated honourably. Refuse, and you will be executed for spying.\nJARED: But you shouldn’t know about the Daleks at all.\nWELLINGTON: We know they are the Emperor’s new allies. We know that two days ago the Emperor was in poor health but that ever since these Daleks appeared on the scene, he has been a changed man.\nJARED: Well, I don’t know much. I know they’re aliens. And they’re armed with these things like laser guns.\nWELLINGTON: Laser guns? What are they?\nJARED: Like your muskets, but more powerful, more powerful even than your cannons.\nDICKSON: I’m sorry, your grace. This man is either mocking us or insane.\nJARED: Hey, I said you wouldn’t believe me. But I can tell you one thing. If Napoleon has the Daleks on his side, you are gonna get massacred.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. INT. DUNGEONS.\nDOCTOR: A visit from the Supreme Dalek. Can I assume you have realised I was telling the truth?\nSUPREME DALEK: You will prove your identity.\nDOCTOR: Scan my brain. That will be all the proof you require.\nDALEK: Brain pattern matches that of a member of the Kaled race.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. I may have the body of a Time Lord but I have the mind of Davros.\nSUPREME DALEK: This could still be a deception. A malfunction with the device.\nDOCTOR: You require more proof? Then tell me. Is the Doctor’s female associate still with him in the command chamber?\nSUPREME DALEK: She is.\nDOCTOR: Then listen in on their conversation.\nSUPREME DALEK: That is not possible. Davros has deactivated all surveillance within the command chamber.\nDOCTOR: And why do you think he did that? Listen. Give me access to the security computer, and I will be able to reactivate the surveillance.\nSUPREME DALEK: Dalek. Give the Doctor access the security computer.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 82\nDOCTOR: Initiate over-ride order code nine Helix five Meta zero zero Loma One.\nDALEK: Command chamber surveillance re-activated.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.

INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDAVROS: - and that is where you were when you last saw Jared?\nFLIP: Yeah, I think so.\nDAVROS: Hougemont wood. The area which is currently undergoing heavy bombardment by the British artillery.\nFLIP: What?\nDAVROS: But at the time your friend went missing, that area was occupied by the British. Let us hope, for his sake, that he was captured...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. EXT. MONT ST JEAN.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ENGLISH ARTILLERY FIRING IN B/G. ORDERS BEING YELLED, HORSES BEING SURPRISED. )\nWELLINGTON: Report, Captain Dickson!\nDICKSON: Our artillery, sir. When French began to fire on them, they disobeyed their orders and returned fire.\nWELLINGTON: The idiots! And meanwhile the French infantry continue to advance through the wood!\nJARED: Woah. This is just like Command and Conquer.\nJARED: What was that?\nDICKSON: Napoleon’s artillery. He’s throwing the whole lot at us.\nWELLINGTON: Captain! Order all our men behind the ridge, order them to lie down. Napoleon is firing blind!\nWELLINGTON: Where is that French spy?\nDICKSON: He’s.. he’s running off sir, heading for Hougemont.\nWELLINGTON: Scurrying back to his Emperor. Let him run. He won’t get far!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. EXT. LA BELLE ALLIANCE.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ARTILLERY IS, IF ANYTHING, LOUDER HERE. FRENCH SOLDIERS SHOUTING ORDERS )\nNEY: Emperor, it’s working. They’re wasting their artillery trying to return fire!\nBONAPARTE: It is natural cowardice. The violent instinct of self- preservation! Men try to destroy their attackers in order to avoid being destroyed themselves.\nNEY: But even the massed guns of the Grande Batterie will not destroy the Allied army.\nBONAPARTE: Our intention is not to destroy the enemy, Marshal Ney. Our intention is to break his spirit. It is better to cause your enemy to flee in fear than to face him in battle.\nNEY: But Emperor, the British have nowhere to flee to...\nBONAPARTE: Exactly. They will enter into the fight with the taste of defeat in their mouths. Gentlemen, the battle is already half- won!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nFLIP: Can’t you send out a Dalek patrol to rescue him or something?\nDAVROS: Not without arousing suspicion. The Daleks must continue to believe I am Davros. I’ve already risked a great deal in preventing the Daleks from exterminating you.\nFLIP: Oh, right. I get it. You can’t save my boyfriend because it might blow your cover!\nDAVROS: Flip, if the Daleks find out who I really am, both our lives would be forfeit...\nDAVROS: (FX: DURING THIS FINAL SPEECH, WE MOVE BACK TO THE DUNGEONS, AND THE DALEKS AND THE DOCTOR LISTENING IN)\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. INT. DUNGEON.\nSUPREME DALEK: He is the Doctor. He must be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: So, you believe me at last?\nSUPREME DALEK: You are Davros. (BEAT) Do you wish to punish us?\nDOCTOR: You failed to recognise your own Emperor. You imprisoned me. You humiliated me. I am not inclined to forgiveness.\nSUPREME DALEK: What is your command?\nDOCTOR: You. The Dalek that brought me here. Self-destruct.\nDALEK: I obey. I obey. I obey.\nDOCTOR: And as for you, Supreme Dalek. Increase neural electro- stimulation by a factor of ten for five seconds.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey. (SCREECHES IN AGONY FOR FIVE SECONDS)\nDOCTOR: Now you will know better than to make that mistake again!\nSUPREME DALEK: I will order the Daleks to enter the command chamber and exterminate the Doctor and the human female.\nDOCTOR: No! Wait. Let us listen to them some more. I want to know exactly what the Doctor had planned.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55. INT. DAVROS CHAMBER.\nDAVROS: “Try walking a mile in another man’s shoes.” I know now what it is to be Davros. To have the mind of a genius trapped inside what is essentially a corpse.\nFLIP: But I know people, who are disabled, and they’re not all self- piteous about it.\nDAVROS: This is not the same thing. This is not life. Let me tell you, if I knew I would be trapped in this body permanently, I would not be able to endure it as Davros does. The pain is too great, and too constant. If there was a switch on this chair, a switch that would turn off the life-support, that would bring an end to the agony, I would press that switch in an instant. I would not have the willpower to resist it.\nFLIP: And that’s what Davros has put up with?\nDAVROS: He has done so for centuries, sustained by nothing more than hatred and his desire for revenge.\nFLIP: Dumb question, but why did you swap bodies with him then?\nDAVROS: It’s quite a story. It began when I detected the arrival of the Dalek mothership in this time-period. I managed to break inside, and conceal myself in the command chamber...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDALEK: Human designation Bonaparte has been located.\nDAVROS: Excellent. According to documented history, he is about to proceed to Waterloo. Have him brought to me.\nDALEK: I obey.\nSUPREME DALEK: Why do you seek an alliance with this human?\nDAVROS: It is the ideal opportunity to test the potential of the mind- exchange in the field of battle. We can use our mind-exchanged humans to dictate the outcome.\nSUPREME DALEK: We could wipe out both of the armies now. We do not need to use humans.\nDAVROS: Maybe not in this conflict, no, but in other wars, wars in the future, the ability to exchange minds could hand us victory.\nSUPREME DALEK: Why this time? Why this war?\nDAVROS: This battle marks a point where the future of mankind hangs in the balance. Had he defeated the British and Prussian armies at Waterloo, Napoleon would have taken the first step towards total dominance in Europe. Within a century the globe would have been under the control of the French Empire. A regime of absolute autocracy, but also of great scientific progress. At last, the human race could achieve its potential. Transformed from an enemy into a potential ally of the Daleks.\nSUPREME DALEK: Why this human Bonaparte?\nDAVROS: I have studied all the major figures from human history. He is the most brilliant military tactician who ever lived.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 90\nSUPREME DALEK: There are others who have gained dominion over this world.\nDAVROS: Yes, there have been other warmongers, but they are all driven by superstitious beliefs or trivial biological distinctions. Bonaparte is a truly rational man. A man who knows only one god. Power.\nSUPREME DALEK: You admire this human?\nDAVROS: He has a genius for war. And when our experiment is complete, I will take that genius from him, and implant it into every Dalek battle computer!\nDALEK: Intruder detected in loading bay. Cross-referencing intruder appearance. It is the Doctor!\nDAVROS: The Doctor? Find him and exterminate him. On no account must he be allowed to gain access to this chamber.\nSUPREME DALEK: We obey.\nDOCTOR: Ah. It might be a little late for that, I’m afraid.\nDAVROS: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You were expecting someone else?\nDAVROS: Of course. You accessed the ship’s security computer and created a ghost image, to act as a diversion?\nDOCTOR: Top marks. I had to find out what you were planning, Davros. I’ve been skulking in the shadows for the last hour. And, may I say, it’s been most educational.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 91\nDAVROS: So you know of my intentions. That knowledge will not prevent your death.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of that.\nDAVROS: The Supreme Dalek will return in a few moments, and when he discovers you here, you will be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I'd kind of taken that as read. Let me see...\nDAVROS: What are you doing? Leave that device alone.\nDOCTOR: This is the machine you use to exchange minds, is that right?\nDAVROS: You know it is.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thought so. Very impressive piece of work, if you don’t mind me saying. Lots of intriguing possibilities.\nDAVROS: Leave it alone, Doctor. You don’t know what you’re doing.\nDOCTOR: Well, we’ll see about that. Now you place one of these transfer arrays on your head and the other on the head of the person you wish to swap minds with...\nDAVROS: Doctor. If you intend to threaten me -\nDOCTOR: Threaten you? If I were you, Davros, I’d start getting ready to run!\nDAVROS: Doctor. You cannot do this to me. You cannot, you —\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 92\nDOCTOR: - cannot!\nDAVROS: A little late for that, Davros. Oh, and a word of warning, I wouldn’t try to exchange our minds back. I made a tiny alteration to the circuit, and —\nDAVROS: - I’m afraid you don’t have time to repair it.\nDOCTOR: Why have you done this to me?\nDAVROS: I could tell you, but I’m sure that knowledge will, ah, not prevent your death. The Daleks will have discovered my diversion by now. In a few moments they’1ll be gliding in through that door...\nDOCTOR: If they exterminate me, you will never be able to return to your body.\nDAVROS: To defeat you, Davros, that is a price worth paying.\nDOCTOR: I shall kill you for this, Doctor. I shall return.\nDAVROS: And I will be waiting for you.\nDAVROS: (NARRATION) And so, Davros fled the chamber...\nDALEKS: The Doctor has escaped. Find him! Find him!\nDALEK: Report! Dalek pursuit ship commencing launch. It is not responding to command signals.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 93\nSUPREME DALEK: It is the Doctor. Destroy the ship. Destroy it!\nDALEK: I obey. Launching warp missiles!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER/DUNGEON.\nFLIP: And that’s where I came in. The ship crashed on Earth, and Jared and me found Davros in the escape capsule...\nDAVROS: Yes. I imagine he intended to blackmail me by attempting to change the course of history in the 21st century. It was just your bad luck that he happened to run into you.\nFLIP: But you still haven’t told me, why swap minds with Davros in the first place?\nDAVROS: Because, as Davros, I have access to the mind-exchange. And once I have made sure that Napoleon loses the battle of Waterloo I will use it on the Daleks. You see, while it can exchange minds, it can also be used to wipe them.\nFLIP: Wipe them? You’re gonna use it to kill the Daleks?\nDAVROS: No. I’m going to give them an opportunity to start again. With their minds stripped of Davros’ conditioning, they will be like children. Innocent, willing to learn.\nFLIP: (D) To learn what?\nDAVROS: (D) To be a force for good in the universe.\nDOCTOR: Such naivety. To imagine he could reform the Daleks! I have heard enough. It is time we returned to the command chamber.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. EXT. WOODS.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE FRENCH BARRAGE CONTINUES UNABATED, AMIDST THE SOUNDS OF GUNFIRE, SHOUTS AND YELLS, SOMEONE RUNNING THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH )\nJARED: Oh man, what a way to die — blown up by the cannons of the British army...\nPASCAL: Halt, Englishman, or we will shoot.\nJARED: Or shot by the French. This is so not my day.\nPASCAL: The dark-skinned British spy. The Emperor will be delighted. You know, he sent me to find you?\nJARED: Listen, you should watch yourself, mate, that Emperor of yours has some very dodgy friends...\nPASCAL: Soldiers, restrain him. And if he attempts to escape, shoot off his feet.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nFLIP: So how’re we going to stop Napoleon from winning?\nDAVROS: I will need to choose my moment carefully, then — (order)\nSUPREME DALEK: Do not move. Do not move!\nDAVROS: How dare you enter against my instructions. I am your Emperor!\nDOCTOR: No, Doctor. I am the Emperor of the Daleks.\nSUPREME DALEK: You have exchanged bodies. You are the Doctor.\nDAVROS: Oh, so you’ve finally realised, have you? At long last!\nDOCTOR: It took a while, Doctor, but I convinced them in the end.\nSUPREME DALEK: Prepare to exterminate the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, wait!\nFLIP: Don’t tell me, you have a better idea.\nDOCTOR: I do. It seems such a shame to see my old body destroyed. I have grown quite attached to it over the centuries. No. I think the Doctor should be left alive.\nSUPREME DALEK: The Doctor must be exterminated!\nDOCTOR: No! I am your Emperor and you will obey me! Have the Doctor placed in a cell. Where he can suffer as I have suffered!\nDAVROS: I would rather you just killed me.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 97\nDOCTOR: Exactly. I want you to know what it’s been like to be me all these years, Doctor. Trapped in a body that can never die. I want to hear you beg for death. And lock the girl up with him. Let the Doctor watch as her spirit is broken, let him watch as she loses her sanity, let him watch as she slowly grows old and dies.\nFLIP: You really have serious issues, you know that?\nDOCTOR: Take them away. We have wasted enough time with them.\nDALEK: I obey. The prisoners will move! Move!\nDAVROS: You’1l have to push me, I’m afraid Flip.\nFLIP: Okay, Doctor. But I’ve got something to say. Davros?\nDOCTOR: Yes, my dear?\nFLIP: This isn’t over, all right? One of these days I’m gonna make you regret this like you would not believe.\nDOCTOR: Charming girl. Now, let us begin the next phase of the experiment...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nBONAPARTE: The ground has dried, our army is in position, and our cavalry is mounted. The time has come for us to attack!\nBONAPARTE: We shall begin with an infantry strike at the centre of the\nBONAPARTE: British line at the farmhouse at La Haye Sainte. We will use it to drive a wedge in the British defence...\nBONAPARTE: I’m sorry, gentlemen, if you could excuse me a moment.\nBONAPARTE: What is it? I’m a little busy!\nSUPREME DALEK: (FX: VIA RADIO)\nSUPREME DALEK: Emperor Bonaparte. You will despatch one hundred officers to the Chateau Rossome.\nBONAPARTE: You need them now? Can’t it wait?\nSUPREME DALEK: (FX: VIA RADIO) You will send them immediately.\nBONAPARTE: Very well. Was there anything else?\nSUPREME DALEK: (FX: VIA RADIO) The Emperor will be joining you to watch over the battle.\nBONAPARTE: The Emperor? But I thought he couldn’t leave the Chateau.\nSUPREME DALEK: He has acquired a new body. He will be escorted by two Daleks.\nPASCAL: Emperor!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 99\nBONAPARTE: Captain Pascal, what do you want?\nPASCAL: Sorry to interrupt you, sire, but as you can see, I have recaptured the British spy, as you ordered.\nBONAPARTE: Good work, Captain, good work.\nJARED: Oh my god, it’s Napoleon! I’ve met the Duke of Wellington and now Napoleon! In the same day!\nBONAPARTE: I have no time to deal with this fool now. Shoot him.\nPASCAL: Yes, sir.\nJARED: What? No. No —\nBONAPARTE: No, on second thoughts, take him to the Chateau Rossome. The Daleks wanted him, let them have hin...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61. INT. DUNGEONS.\nDAVROS: You met Napoleon?\nFLIP: Yeah. He was asking me questions and stuff, about the future. I didn’t tell him anything, mainly because I didn’t know.\nDAVROS: Did he tell you about what he had planned?\nFLIP: He said something about wiping the future from the pages of history.\nDAVROS: Yes. Of course. Napoleon has been told of all the errors he made at the Battle of the Waterloo. And now he’s going into battle, armed with the greatest weapon of them all.\nFLIP: What’s that? Oh my G[od] — It’s not a nuclear bomb, is it?\nDAVROS: No. The benefit of hindsight. The French will win, the course of human history will be changed, and the Earth of the twenty- first century that you knew will cease to ever have existed, replaced by one where Napoleon was victorious at the Battle of Waterloo.\nFLIP: But if my version of history ceases to have existed, how can I be here now?\nDAVROS: That’s exactly it, my dear. You can’t. Everything you’ve ever known will be wiped out in an instant...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. EXT. CHATEAU.\nJARED: So who lives in this Chateau Rossome, then?\nPASCAL: I have heard it is occupied by the Emperor’s new allies, the Daleks.\nJARED: You mean you’ve never actually seen them?\nPASCAL: Nobody has, save for the Emperor himself.\nJARED: (REACTS) Hey, what’s going on, what are all these officers doing here? And, hey, check out their firepower.\nPASCAL: But.. they are not muskets or rifles.\nJARED: No mate, they’re Dalek laser guns. Shhh, watch out!\nDALEK: You have your orders. You are to fight alongside the French and destroy the Allied army.\nSOLDIERS: We obey.\nJARED: Oh, man... they’re turning the French army into Daleks!\nDALEK: The British are the enemies of the Daleks. They must be exterminated.\nDALEK: DALEK & SOLDIERS: (RISING TO CRESCENDO) Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nDALEK: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 102"

You are to fight alongside the French and destroy the Allied army.\nSOLDIERS: We obey.\nJARED: Oh man... they’re turning the French army into Daleks!\nDALEK: The British are the enemies of the Daleks. They must be exterminated.\nDALEK: DALEK & SOLDIERS: (RISING TO CRESCENDO) Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nPASCAL: I don’t understand. It is as though they have been possessed by demons.\nJARED: In a way they have. They’ve had their brains swapped with Daleks. They did it to me once, I don’t recommend it.\nPASCAL: But why?\nJARED: No idea. But if the Daleks are here then odds on the Doctor and Flip are here too. Well, Pascal, are you coming with me?\nPASCAL: With you? You cannot propose we enter the Chateau?\nJARED: You can go back to your battalion if you like. But I’m going in.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nBONAPARTE: The first corp has captured La Haye Sainte and is advancing towards the ridge. The British defence is crumbling and this time the Prussians will not be coming to their rescue!\nDOCTOR: The British cavalry fight bravely. And your men are outnumbered.\nBONAPARTE: Our enemy may outnumber us, but so will their casualties. So long as we prevail, that is all that matters. That is the difference between the Duke and myself. Win or lose, he will have to crawl back to his parliament and beg forgiveness for the death of every man. I have to account for my actions to no- one.\nDOCTOR: So long as you deliver them victory.\nBONAPARTE: I have made a career of doing nothing else. Twenty years ago, France was a country in ruins. From those ruins I have built the greatest empire seen since the fall of Rome!\nDOCTOR: Yet your own people placed you in exile.\nBONAPARTE: Not my own people, Davros. A coup d’état forged by the treacherous Talleyrand and the Count of Artois. My people would follow me into hell if I so desired it. They know I am a man of the people, without distinction of birth or fortune.\nDOCTOR: And yet, had it not been for our intervention, Emperor, this day would have been a humiliating final defeat. You would do well to remember that!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65. INT. DUNGEON.\nFLIP: - then I was in counselling for a bit, and then basically it\nFLIP: was back to real life. I’m still with Jared, more or less.\nDAVROS: More or less?\nFLIP: I think we’re only still together because neither of us wants to be the one to split us up. I still wish he was here, though.\nJARED: (WHISPER) Flip!\nFLIP: Jared! .. And you’ve brought that French guy with you!\nPASCAL: Who is the old man in the metal chair?\nJARED: Him? Oh, that’s Davros.\nFLIP: That’s not Davros, that’s the Doctor. It’s really complicated.\nJARED: He used the Dalek mind-swap thing, right?\nFLIP: Okay, so it’s not that complicated.\nDAVROS: Delighted as I am to see you, may I suggest we leave before the Daleks realise you are here?\nJARED: Whatever you say, you’re the man. Where do you wanna go?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. INT. HATCHERY.\nFLIP: This is the wine cellar? Looks more an aquarium.\nDAVROS: Inside, while I put the security systems out of action -\nJARED: What are we looking for — (SEES) Oh.\nJARED: (FX: QUIETLY AS FIRST, AS THEY APPROACH, WE HEAR THE VOICES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN MIND-SWAPPED WITH DALEKS AND ARE NOW TRAPPED INSIDE DALEKS.\nDALEK VOICES: (VARIOUSLY) Where am I? Help m. Is there anyone there? I am dead? Etc.\nPASCAL: What are those squid-creatures, in the water tanks?\nDAVROS: Daleks. This is a Dalek hatchery.\nPASCAL: But they are speaking? Why?\nDALEK: Where am I? Where am I?\nDAVROS: It’s alright. You’re.. safe.\nDALEK: Who are you?\nDAVROS: A friend. Please, try not to be scared. What is your name?\nDALEK: I am.. Leon Dupont. I am an officer in the Imperial Guard. It hurts... Who has done this to me?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 106\nDAVROS: What’s the last thing you remember?\nDALEK: I remember... being sent to the Chateau Rossome on the orders of the Emperor.\nJARED: Then there’s your answer.\nPASCAL: Bonaparte has done this?\nDAVROS: All part of the Dalek plan. To ensure he wins the battle, they exchange the minds of his soldiers with those of Daleks.\nDALEK: I want to go back. Back to how I used to be. My family... my wife Sophia. My daughter Collette... my father’s farm in Provence... I want to go back!\nDALEKS: (VARIOUSLY, PLEADING) Help me! Where am I?\nDAVROS: I’ll do everything I can. But I can’t promise anything -\nDALEKS: (OVER EACH OTHER) Then let us die! Kill me! Kill us! Let us die!\nJARED: Doctor, we have to help them.\nDAVROS: That’s why I’ve brought you here. This is not only the Dalek hatchery but also their armoury. In the next room you will a supply of Dalek guns.\nFLIP: For us to use on the Daleks?\nDAVROS: No. That would be suicide. At the moment, Napoleon’s cavalry are destroying the British line. Within a few hours, they will be wiped out, unless the Prussian army come to their aid.\nJARED: But when I was with the Duke Of Wellington, he said the Prussians were being held back by the French at a place called Wavre.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 107\nFLIP: You’ve met the Duke of Wellington?\nJARED: Yeah.\nFLIP: I am so jealous of you right now.\nDAVROS: So what I want you to do is to use the Daleks’ weapons to help the Prussians break through the French blockade.\nJARED: Okay, I’1ll give it a go. Pascal. What about you?\nPASCAL: Me?\nJARED: Will you help me?\nPASCAL: After what Bonaparte has done to our own men? There can be no doubt.\nDAVROS: Also, you should attach these devices to your clothes.\nJARED: What are they?\nDAVROS: Prismatic force fields, like the ones the Daleks use. They’1l\nDAVROS: allow you to move through the battlefield unseen.\nJARED: Handy.\nDAVROS: They do not, however, make you invincible. So take care.\nJARED: Will do. Ready, Pascal? Okay, bye, Doctor, Flip.\nFLIP: You look after yourself, all right? I promise, if you end up dead I will kill you.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 108\nFLIP: So what do we do while they’re off playing soldiers?\nDAVROS: We have to get back to the command chamber.\nFLIP: The command chamber? But it’s guarded, and you’re not exactly nimble on your feet -\nDAVROS: No, but I do have one advantage. I am half-Dalek.\nFLIP: Yeah. And?\nDAVROS: This cellar contains everything needed to build a Dalek. So, if\nDAVROS: you were to place the top half of a Dalek casing on top of me -\nFLIP: - you’d look exactly like a Dalek. Cool!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nPASCAL: It feels strange, being able to walk through the French lines. As though we are ghosts.\nJARED: Kind of lucky, otherwise we’d have been shot by now. There must be ten thousand men out there!\nPASCAL: It is the way of battle. It does not matter how many of your men die, so long as you have the last man standing.\nPASCAL: What was that?\nJARED: Those officers we saw, they’re using Dalek guns.\nPASCAL: Incredible. They kill with nothing more than a — (ray)\nJARED: Pascal! Watch out!\nJARED: (RUSHING OVER) Mate? You all right? Mate?\nPASCAL: (MORTALLY WOUNDED) I die now. Jared... mon brave... Please, you must stop him. Stop the traitor — Bonaparte... (DIES)\nJARED: I’1ll do my best, mate. I’1l do my best.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: What is the meaning of this intrusion?\nDAVROS: (IMPERSONATING A DALEK) I have captured this human attempting to escape.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor’s associate? But she should be — Supreme Dalek. Check the cells.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey. (BEAT) All security systems have been deactivated.\nDOCTOR: What? Out of my way, fool!\nDOCTOR: The Doctor has gone. Supreme Dalek. All Daleks are to be assigned to find the Doctor.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR: I will interrogate the girl. The Dalek will remain here.\nDOCTOR: Now, my dear. You will tell me where the Doctor is. Or I will order the Dalek to fire upon you with increasing intensity until every particle of your being is screaming out in agony.\nFLIP: Er, don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: What?\nFLIP: Step away from those controls. Or I’1ll shoot you.\nDOCTOR: A Dalek gun? Where did you get that?\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 111\nDAVROS: (IMPERSONATING A DALEK) From me.\nDOCTOR: Girl. You cannot possibly know how to operate that weapon.\nFLIP: I’m sorry. But turns out, I was taught by an expert.\nDOCTOR: (HIT) What have you done — I cannot move - paralyzed —\nDAVROS: (IMPERSONATING A DALEK) Don’t worry. The effect is only temporary. I hope. Now, Flip. The control panel to your left. Third switch up.\nFLIP: Third switch, got it.\nDOCTOR: Leave those controls alone. You do not know what you are doing!\nFLIP: Er, I think the problem is, we know exactly what we’re doing!\nDAVROS: Now, if you could lift this thing off me -\nFLIP: Alright, give us a chance. These things are heavy.\nDOCTOR: The Doctor! Disguised as a Dalek. But if you think I will allow you to take this body back, you are sadly mistaken.\nDAVROS: You forget, Davros. It’s my body, I decide what happens to it.\nDAVROS: Flip. Quickly, place the transfer array on his head.\nFLIP: All right, bossy, going as fast as I can.\nDAVROS: Now, the first switch, turn it to the fullest extent.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 112\nDOCTOR: No. You cannot send me back. Have pity on me!\nDAVROS: Pity? You expect me to show you pity?\nDOCTOR: You know what it is to live as I do, Doctor. Would you wish to inflict such pain and suffering on even your worst enemy?\nDAVROS: I’m sorry, Davros. Truly I am. If there was any other way, I would take it. But it’s time for you to go home.\nDOCTOR: No, Doctor, you cannot, you cannot —\nDAVROS: - do this to me! No! No! NO! (GURGLES IN PAIN)\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But I can’t have you walking around pretending to be me. I have a reputation to keep up!\nFLIP: Doctor! You’re back!\nDOCTOR: I am indeed. And it feels, well, it feels terrible actually, did you have to shoot me in the leg?\nFLIP: You told me to do it!\nDOCTOR: Yes, so I did, it just seemed so much easier when it was happening to somebody else. Keep an eye on Davros. Make sure he doesn’t raise the alarm.\nFLIP: No problem. While you do what?\nDOCTOR: Give me a few minutes until the effect of the Dalek gun wears off and then you’1l find out...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nWELLINGTON: It’s no good. La Haye Sainte has fallen to the French, our cavalry is lost, and our defence line is perilously thin.\nDICKSON: Our infantry are no match for the French artillery.\nJARED: Er, sorry to interrupt, Duke of Wellington, and try not to be freaked out, but -\nWELLINGTON: What the deuce! How did he get here?\nJARED: Listen. Before you shoot me, I’m here to help. You know those weapons I told you about? The ones the French are using against you?\nWELLINGTON: Yes. The devices you called ‘laser guns’.\nJARED: Yeah, well, I’ve brought you a present.\nWELLINGTON: Twenty of these firearms will not be any good. Even a hundred would not be enough for us to win this battle.\nJARED: I was thinking maybe you get together a small company of men and we use them to frighten off General Grouchy’s lot at Wavre.\nWELLINGTON: You can instruct my men how to use these weapons?\nJARED: Yeah. It’s not difficult. Just point and click.\nDICKSON: Duke, you cannot intend to trust this... turncoat.\nWELLINGTON: Desperate situations require desperate measures. We have\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 114 nothing to lose and, if the Prussians get through, everything to gain. Captain Dickson. You will lead the mission.\nDICKSON: As your grace commands. You, Frenchman. Come with me!\nWELLINGTON: (PRAYER) Oh Lord. Give me night or give me Blucher!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nFLIP: Nearly done, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just one moment, nearly there...\nFLIP: Only any second now the Daleks are gonna be back and -\nSUPREME DALEK: The Doctor is here. He must be exterminated.\nDAVROS: Not me, you fool. Him! He is the Doctor. He used the mind- exchange to transfer his mind back.\nDOCTOR: No. He is the Doctor. I am Davros.\nSUPREME DALEK: No. If you were the Emperor, you would have raised the alarm.\nDOCTOR: Oh well, it was worth a try.\nDAVROS: Supreme Dalek. I must exchange my mind with that of the Doctor. I must have his body back.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, but this property is not to let.\nDAVROS: I cannot remain in this miserable form a second longer. I\nDAVROS: cannot endure the pain. I must have life!\nSUPREME DALEK: Dalek. Place the transfer array on the Emperor.\nDALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 116\nFLIP: Er, Doctor, aren’t you gonna do something?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, but if I try to resist, they will exterminate you.\nDAVROS: You see, my dear. Even the Doctor knows when he is beaten. All is prepared? Then activate the mind-exchange!\nDALEK: I obey.\nDALEK: DAVROS & DOCTOR: (AS ONE, IN SUDDEN EXCRUCIATING PAIN) Turn it off! Turn it off!\nDAVROS: What have you done? Why I have I not changed bodies?\nDOCTOR: A transparent ruse, Doctor. Pretending the mind-exchange has not worked. When it has!\nDAVROS: It did not work. I am still in this body!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Doctor. And there you will remain.\nDAVROS: But I am Davros.\nDOCTOR: No, Doctor. I am Davros.\nFLIP: Okay, well, I’m confused.\nSUPREME DALEK: One of you is the Doctor.\nSUPREME DALEK: DAVROS & THE DOCTOR: Yes. Him!\nSUPREME DALEK: We will identify which is the Doctor from his brain patterns.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 117\nDALEK: I obey.\nDALEK: Unable to perform brain scan. Residual effects of mind-exchange too great.\nFLIP: Wait, wait. I know a way of telling which one is Davros.\nSUPREME DALEK: Speak!\nFLIP: When I was with Davros, I told him the name of my mum’s boyfriend. Only Davros will be able to give the correct answer.\nSUPREME DALEK: You will both answer the question. Or the girl will die.\nDOCTOR: When I was with her, she told me... his name was Steve.\nDAVROS: And she told me his name was Nigel.\nSUPREME DALEK: Which is correct? Answer. Answer!\nFLIP: I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s Nigel.\nDAVROS: You see! The girl admits it! I am Davros! I am your Emperor.\nSUPREME DALEK: No - the girl is a associate of the Doctor’s. She would intend to deceive us.\nDAVROS: What? No. No! You cretinous fools!\nDOCTOR: You see, Doctor. Your pathetic ruse has failed.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 118\nDAVROS: But I am Davros! The Doctor... he must have sabotaged the mind- exchange...\nDOCTOR: Take the Doctor away. Lock him in a cell with his associate.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey. Move! Move!\nDAVROS: But I am your Emperor!\nFLIP: Doctor, you can give it up now, they’ve worked it out.\nDAVROS: But I am not the Doctor. Listen to me! I am Davros! I am DAVROS!\nDOCTOR: Supreme Dalek. Order the Emperor Bonaparte to come here.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR: I have handed him victory. It is time he repaid his debt.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nDICKSON: This is it, this is Wavre.. men! Take positions!\nJARED: And those are Grouchy’s troops. More than I thought.\nDICKSON: The men are all in position. Are you ready?\nJARED: No, not remotely, but let’s do it anyway.\nDICKSON: Then men, ready, take aim. And... fire!\nDICKSON: (FX: CHEERS, ROARS OF SOLDIERS CHARGING, DALEK LASER FIRE AND AGONIZING DEATH SCREAMS OF SURPRISED FRENCHMEN. )\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Supreme Dalek. Now that mind-exchanged soldiers have delivered victory their work is done. Have them return to the hatchery.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey.\nDALEK: I have brought you the Emperor Bonaparte.\nBONAPARTE: Why have you summoned me? The battle is at a crucial stage! The moment of greatest peril is at the moment of victory!\nDOCTOR: Your participation is no longer required. Your army controls La Haye Sainte and the British guns. The British are surrounded without hope of reinforcement.\nBONAPARTE: You do not understand. A General must remain at the battle,\nBONAPARTE: until the last man of his enemies has died, surrendered or fled.\nDOCTOR: Dalek Supreme, leave us.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey.\nBONAPARTE: So. Explain! For what reason have I been brought here?\nDOCTOR: I want to know why you’re doing this. Why you agreed to sell out the human race to the Daleks.\nBONAPARTE: Who are you? You’re not Davros.\nDOCTOR: No. I’m the Doctor.\nBONAPARTE: (AMUSED) The Doctor? So we meet at last! You do realise I am armed? I could kill you.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 121\nDOCTOR: You could. But then the Daleks would kill you.\nBONAPARTE: Or I could raise the alarm, tell them you’re the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It would be your word against mine. I think the Daleks would be more inclined to believe their Emperor. So tell me. Why did you agree to help Davros?\nBONAPARTE: When I first met him, I was in poor health, barely able to eat or sleep. He gave me some pills and I was rejuvenated. Then he told me I would lose the forthcoming battle and spend the rest of my life in exile on the island of St Helena.\nDOCTOR: And you believed him?\nBONAPARTE: I did not have to believe him. He showed me.\nDOCTOR: He showed you?\nBONAPARTE: He took me to see the man I would become. And my future self told me all about Waterloo, Doctor. He even showed me, using toy soldiers, how he had come so close to victory until the arrival of the Prussian army. And now that is a vision of the future that will never come to pass.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of that -\nBONAPARTE: What are you doing?\nBONAPARTE: (FX: DOCTOR PUNCHES BONAPARTE, KNOCKING HIM TO THE FLOOR, THEN TIES HIM UP UNDER THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE. )\nDOCTOR: Don’t struggle, I’m not trying to hurt you. Now, say aah.\nBONAPARTE: Aah!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 122\nDOCTOR: Apologies in advance, but I’m going to have to put you somewhere out of sight... this should do it.\nDOCTOR: Now, just be a good dictator and keep quiet...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nDICKSON: It’s working! The French are retreating like frightened dogs! The road to La Belle Alliance is clear! And all thanks to you and your “laser” guns.\nJARED: Don’t mention it. Really. This mustn’t end up in any history books, it would look bad.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Supreme Dalek. Bonaparte’s army is certain of triumph and the course of history has been changed. Our work here is done.\nSUPREME DALEK: No. We agreed that after the Battle, the human Bonaparte’s mind would be exchanged with that of a Dalek.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I remember. But on reflection, it will not be necessary. Bonaparte will serve us loyally.\nSUPREME DALEK: Humans are unreliable. The Earth must be placed under Dalek control. We need his mind for our battle computers.\nDOCTOR: Very well, you shall have it. Now leave me. I wish to be alone.\nSUPREME DALEK: I obey.\nDOCTOR: I hope you caught all that.\nBONAPARTE: (GAG BEING REMOVED) This is all some deception!\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’ve been tricked, your imperial majesty. The Daleks never intended to allow you reign as Emperor of the Earth.\nBONAPARTE: The Dalek... it said it wanted my mind.\nDOCTOR: To use your genius to subjugate the Earth, and a thousand other worlds beside.\nBONAPARTE: The whole world... ruled by those creatures. In my name!\nDOCTOR: Do I detect a change of heart?\nBONAPARTE: More than that. I have been betrayed. I demand revenge!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75. EXT. MONT ST JEAN.\nWELLINGTON: Captain Dickson, what news?\nDICKSON: The Prussians, sir. They’re advancing towards Plancenoit.\nJARED: They should be there within an hour.\nWELLINGTON: Then Bonaparte’s remaining forces will be divided between two fronts - outnumbered and outflanked! Gentlemen, there is a chance this day may yet be ours!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nBONAPARTE: I have only ever wanted to do the best for my people, Doctor. To show resolve where lesser men would show weakness.\nDOCTOR: Then you have a simple choice. If you win the battle, the Daleks will make you their puppet.\nBONAPARTE: Or I can lose and spend my last days a broken man, exiled to St Helena.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s your choice, Napoleon Bonaparte. Your destiny. Whose Side are you on? The Daleks? Or the human race?\nBONAPARTE: I ask no man to do what I would not willingly do myself. If I have to sacrifice my life, my career, my reputation then so be it. I will deliberately lose the battle of Waterloo, as my destiny dictates. For the glory of France!\nDOCTOR: Then go. And do your worst.\nBONAPARTE: What is history, after all, but a fable that men agree upon? Goodbye, Doctor. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: Now, Doctor. Go and find Flip in the dungeons, or indulge ina little sabotage first? Well, while I’m here, I suppose I might as well do what comes naturally...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77. INT. DUNGEONS.\nDAVROS: The Daleks will realize their mistake. And you and the Doctor will be made to suffer!\nFLIP: God, do you ever talk about anything else?\nDAVROS: There is nothing else, my dear, but the pursuit of power. Of domination over all things.\nFLIP: But why? What’s the point of it all?\nDAVROS: To survive. To endure.\nFLIP: Yeah, and that plan’s really worked out for you, hasn’t it?\nDAVROS: What?\nFLIP: Take a look in the mirror, see where it’s got you. You know what? I feel sorry for you. I actually feel sorry for you.\nDAVROS: I do not want your pity. When the time comes, I will show you no mercy!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nDICKSON: Your grace, the Imperial Guard are in retreat - and the Prussians have taken Plancenoit. You can see the blaze from here!\nWELLINGTON: Excellent. And so can the French army. It will soon be over, and yet in the face of so much death, it is hard to be anything but broken-hearted.\nDICKSON: Indeed. Let us pray there is never another day like it.\nWELLINGTON: And a damned close-run thing too. If it hadn’t been for — where did that boy go?\nDICKSON: What boy?\nWELLINGTON: That young Frenchman. He seems to have vanished into thin air...\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT. DUNGEON.\nDOCTOR: Flip? Are you in there?\nFLIP: Doctor! For a minute there, I thought you’d forgotten about me.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I could never forget about you!\nDAVROS: This is all very touching, Doctor. But you have still lost. With the knowledge we have given him, Bonaparte cannot lose the Battle of Waterloo.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be so sure. Last time I looked, the Prussians were capturing Plancenoit. The Duke Of Wellington will win and history will return to its proper course.\nDAVROS: (GURGLES IN ANGER) The Daleks will still be victorious. The mind-exchanged soldiers —\nDOCTOR: All withdrawn from the field of battle. Your little war game’s over, Davros.\nDAVROS: No, Doctor. You may have won the battle, but you will never win the war.\nDOCTOR: Really? And why is that, may I ask?\nDAVROS: Because to win a war you must be prepared to make sacrifices. You will ultimately lose, Doctor, because you do not have the stomach to let others die for the greater good.\nDOCTOR: No, Davros. That is why I will win. Because I have something actually worth fighting for.\nDAVROS: You are a sentimental fool. If you had any courage, you would kill me now.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 130\nDOCTOR: And now that I know what it’s like to be you, Davros, I think that would be an act of mercy.\nDAVROS: You are wrong. I have learned something too, Doctor. This body may be old and weak, but it only serves to strengthen my will. The pain is what makes my mind strong. The relentless agony is what drives me on to achieve greatness. Given the choice, I would rather inhabit this body than any other!\nDOCTOR: Then I’m afraid you are quite, quite mad. Goodbye, Davros.\nFLIP: Yeah. See you, wouldn’t want to be you!\nDAVROS: Run, Doctor! Run! But I shall have my revenge! This is not the\nDAVROS: end! THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!\nDAVROS: (FX: DURING THIS, WE MOVE TO DAVROS’ CONTROL CHAMBER WHERE HE IS BEING LISTENED TO...)\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER\nSUPREME DALEK: The Doctor and Davros have not swapped minds. Alert! The Doctor is heading for the hatchery. He is to be exterminated!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81. INT. HATCHERY.\nFLIP: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: The Dalek alert. They must have been monitoring our conversation with Davros. Quickly, inside!\nFLIP: Doctor, all these French soldiers, what are they doing here?\nDOCTOR: They’ve returned here to have their minds swapped back.\nFLIP: You can do that?\nDOCTOR: I can try. Fingers crossed.\nDALEK: There is someone here! There is someone here!\nDALEK: (FX: QUIETLY AS FIRST, THE VOICES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN MIND-SWAPPED WITH DALEKS AND ARE NOW TRAPPED INSIDE DALEKS. ‘WHO IS IT?’ ‘HELP US!’)\nDALEKS: (VARIOUSLY) Who is it? Help us! Please! Etc.\nDALEK: Who are you? Who are you?\nDOCTOR: That would take too long to explain right now, but I’m here to help you. I’m going to return you to your bodies!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nSUPREME DALEK: Emperor. I.. regret my error in imprisoning you.\nDAVROS: I have no time to punish you now. You will be made to suffer in due course. Where is the Doctor?\nSUPREME DALEK: He is in the Dalek hatchery.\nDAVROS: The Doctor intends to restore the human’s minds. (LAUGHS)\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83. INT. HATCHERY.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOCTOR WORKING ON CONTROLS WHEN THE DALEKS AND SOLDIERS BOTH SCREAM IN PAIN. ‘HELP US!’ ‘I AM BURNING!’ ‘LET US DIE!’)\nFLIP: Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Someone’s remotely over-loading the system. (BEAT) Davros!\nFLIP: What do you mean, overloading it?\nDOCTOR: He’s killed all the Daleks, all the soldiers. They’re all dead.\nFLIP: All of them?\nDOCTOR: Yes.. every living soul here, sacrificed by that pitiless monster.\nFLIP: Er... Then he knows we’re here.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFLIP: Then hadn’t we better get out of here?\nDOCTOR: This way, come on!\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS THE DOCTOR AND FLIP LEAVE, DOOR OPENS, DALEKS TRUNDLE IN, FIRING LASERS )\nDALEKS: It is the Doctor! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84. EXT. BATTLEFIELD.\nBONAPARTE: Marshal Ney. How proceeds the battle?\nNEY: It is no good, sire. The Prussians have taken Plancenoit, the British have recaptured La Haye Sainte and all the Imperial Guard are dead. All that remains are your personal bodyguard.\nBONAPARTE: Then it is time we gave up the struggle. We shall depart for Paris.\nNEY: But if we regroup, wait for General Grouchy to —\nBONAPARTE: No, my friend. The day belongs to the Duke. Destiny has accomplished her purpose in me, and now it is time, at last, to accept defeat. (AMUSED) ‘At Waterloo... Napoleon did surrender.’\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 85. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nSUPREME DALEKS: Daleks report the Doctor and his associate have escaped from the Chateau —\nDAVROS: Order all patrols to recapture them. The Doctor must — (be)\nDAVROS: What is happening?\nSUPREME DALEK: Mothership drive systems have been activated. Countdown for temporal jump has commenced.\nDAVROS: The Doctor! This is his work! He must have programmed the drive computer for a delayed launch... Abort the countdown!\nSUPREME DALEK: Unable to halt countdown. All systems have been locked.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 86. EXT. CHATEAU.\nFLIP: Doctor, I can’t keep up -\nDOCTOR: You have to. In a moment, the Dalek mothership is going to dematerialize.\nFLIP: So?\nDOCTOR: So it will leave behind a vacuum! Everything in the vicinity will be sucked into the implosion.\nFLIP: You mean the Chateau Rossome?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It will disappear without a trace. Any moment now!\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 87. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDAVROS: Cancel it! Abort the launch!\nSUPREME DALEK: It is too late. Temporal drive systems activated.\nDAVROS: What is that? The mind-exchange! The Doctor has interfered with\nDAVROS: the controls... Destroy it! Destroy it at once!\nDALEK: Countdown to temporal jump. Five. Four. Three. Two One.\nDAVROS: (OVER DALEK LINE)\nDAVROS: No. The Doctor has programmed it to.. no! No! No!

Are you alright?\nFLIP: I think so. My ears hurt, but that’s all. Hey, we destroyed their chateau. Gets them back for blowing up my flat!\nDOCTOR: They blew up your flat?\nFLIP: Yeah. Thanks to the Daleks I haven’t got a home or a job to go to.\nJARED: Doctor! Flip!\nFLIP: Jared! You’re all right!\nJARED: Course. I know how to look after myself. And being invisible helps.\nDOCTOR: Thanks to you, history is back on track. And Captain Pascal?\nJARED: He died, Doctor. Along with god knows how many others.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Too many. Come on. I think it’s time we left them in peace.\nDOCTOR WHO: WATERLOO OF THE DALEKS by Jonathan Morris Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 89. INT. DAVROS’ CHAMBER.\nDAVROS: (WAKING) Where, where am I.. I can still remember! I am Davros. The mind-wipe failed! (LAUGHS)\nSUPREME DALEK: What am I?\nDAVROS: What?\nSUPREME: What am I Where am I? Who are you?\nDAVROS: You don’t know? You don’t know who I am?\nDAVROS: DALEKS & SUPREME: Who are you? What am I? Where am I?\nDAVROS: I am Davros. I am your Emperor. And you are Daleks. We are in the Dalek mothership, suspended in the time vortex.\nSUPREME DALEK: Davros. Why am I in pain?\nOTHER DALEKS: What am I? Where am I? Who are you?\nDAVROS: Don’t worry, my children.
