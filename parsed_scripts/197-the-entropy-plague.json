Well, you can’t blame me for worrying, you are the baby of the family. (LAUGHS AT RESPONSE) And I’m never going to let you forget it. The programme’s going fine. Better than fine — with a bit of luck Maxis Realtor should be Richter’s-free by the end of the quarter. Then I’1l1 join... No, no sign [yet —]\nADRIC: Wait. Hold on, I’1l1 call you back. It’s her, I think it’s her!\nADRIC: (GOING OVER TO TARDIS) Hello? .. Mother?\nDOCTOR: Hello, Adric.\nADRIC: Doctor? What’s going on? Where’s my mother? Where’s Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes. That’s why I’ve come here. To tell you in person. Thought it was only right.\nADRIC: She’s not with you...? What’s happened to her? Where is she?\nDOCTOR: There’s no easy way to say this. I’m afraid... I’m afraid you’re never going to see your mother again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 3\nADRIC: What?\nDOCTOR: She — I mean, we; I mean, she —\nADRIC: Just tell me. Is she dead?\nDOCTOR: No, no. She’s alive, I can assure you of that much.\nADRIC: Then where is she?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa is.. somewhere beyond even the TARDIS’s reach.\nADRIC: What’s that supposed to mean? You’ve lost her?\nDOCTOR: Not lost, exactly. A set of circumstances forced us into a situation — [where]\nADRIC: My mother said she would come straight here. She promised, one month ago, back on Valderon.\nDOCTOR: I know, yes. But the TARDIS was diverted. Into E-Space.\nADRIC: (DISBELIEF) E-Space?\nDOCTOR: Another universe. Linked to this one by —\nADRIC: I know what it is, it’s where my namesake came from. So my mother is still in this other universe?\nDOCTOR: . Yes.\nADRIC: (FURIOUS) So why can’t you just go back and get her?\nDOCTOR: It’s not quite as simple as that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 4\nADRIC: You managed it before, why can’t you do it again?\nDOCTOR: There is no way back. The CVE, the link between that universe and this, has been sealed shut.\nADRIC: Then re-open it!\nDOCTOR: Even if that were possible, in an infinite multitude of universes, we’d never find the right one. I’m sorry.\nADRIC: Sorry? Is that all you can say? You tell me I’m never going to see my mother again and all you can do is stand there and make excuses?\nDOCTOR: I’m not making excuses. I take full responsibility. If anyone is to blame for what happened, it’s me.\nADRIC: So what did happen?\nDOCTOR: It’s a long story.\nADRIC: Then the sooner you start, Doctor, the better.\nDOCTOR: Yes, good point. Very well. After we were diverted into E- Space, we needed to find a way back through another CVE. But then Tegan suffered the indignity of being kidnapped by a gang of space pirates...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 2. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nTURLOUGH: Why are we stopping?\nNYSSA: Because the Doctor’s found her.\nTURLOUGH: Already?\nDOCTOR: Residual energy trace from the surface of Isenfel, it wasn’t too hard.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan’s on board that ship?\nDOCTOR: Giving her captors a piece of her mind, no doubt.\nNYSSA: Can we materialise on board?\nDOCTOR: We can try.\nDOCTOR: They’re heading to another solar system. One of the few solar systems.\nNYSSA: (CHECKING READINGS) The third planet is in a temperate orbit. Presumably that’s their destination.\nDOCTOR: Presumably. — Locking on co-ordinates... now.\nTURLOUGH: What is it? What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: (FX: OPERATING CONTROLS) Not sure. Power loss. As though something is siphoning energy from the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 6\nNYSSA: Something? The spaceship?\nDOCTOR: No. Something down there, on the third planet.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the energy drain. It’s increasing.\nDOCTOR: Almost fifty per cent gone already. Fifty-five. Sixty!\nTURLOUGH: What happens if we run out of power?\nDOCTOR: Newton’s first law. We’ll keep on drifting through space until we hit something.\nTURLOUGH: Except with no life support, we’ll either suffocate or freeze to death first.\nDOCTOR: Always looking for a silver lining, aren’t you, Turlough?\nNYSSA: Energy levels now down to twenty per cent.\nDOCTOR: No choice. We’ll have to perform an emergency materialisation.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, the spaceship! I think it’s experiencing the same effect.\nDOCTOR: (PREOCCUPIED) What?\nTURLOUGH: Its navigation lights are flashing and it’s descending towards the planet.\nDOCTOR: Nothing we can do for them, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 7\nTURLOUGH: But without any power they’1ll crash. And Tegan’s on board!\nDOCTOR: I do realise that. But we have our own problems to worry about.\nNYSSA: Five percent.\nDOCTOR: Activating emergency storage cells. Fingers crossed...\nTURLOUGH: There’s not enough power, we’re not going to make it!\nDOCTOR: Come on, old girl. One final push!\nNYSSA: The spaceship, it’s entered the planet’s atmosphere. It’s\nNYSSA: burning up. Tegan!\nDOCTOR: Have to divert every remaining ounce of energy...\nTURLOUGH: You did it. We’re landing.\nDOCTOR: In the very loosest sense. Hold on tight!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM. [CONTINUOUS]\nVIBRATION: ENDS. B/G CONTROL ROOM HUM FADES OUT FROM NOW ON.\nDOCTOR: Everyone alright?\nTURLOUGH: I’m fine. Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Yes. It’s Tegan I’m more worried about. What happened to the spaceship?\nNYSSA: SO, WE HEAR BUTTONS AND SWITCHES CLICKING.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. The console is... dead.\nTURLOUGH: Dead?\nDOCTOR: There’s no power for the instruments. Nothing.\nNYSSA: And the scanner’s blank.\nTURLOUGH: If that wasn’t bad enough, there go the lights!\nNYSSA: But we did land, didn’t we?\nDOCTOR: As far as I can tell. We’re somewhere on that planet. But what it’s like — well, there’s only one way to find out.\nTURLOUGH: Go outside.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNYSSA: But we don’t even know if it has a breathable atmosphere.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: Then I suggest we open the doors very slowly and carefully.\nTURLOUGH: And how do we do that with no power?\nDOCTOR: We take the manual approach. (REACHES UNDER CONSOLE) I remember stowing a crank handle under the console, just in case...\nNYSSA: Doctor, you don’t seem very concerned about Tegan.\nDOCTOR: (FX: FIXES CRANK IN DOOR, TURNING IT AS HE SPEAKS) We made it down in one piece, maybe she did too.\nTURLOUGH: And then what? With the TARDIS out of action, we’re trapped here. We have no way of leaving this world, never mind this universe.\nDOCTOR: (TURNING HANDLE) One thing at a time, eh, Turlough?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: EXT. MARKETPLACE.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: We emerged into an alleyway of a shanty town. The buildings were made of stone with roofs of corrugated iron, and decorated with spray-painted murals and wooden carvings. Everything was bathed in the sickly glow of a red sun hanging low in the sky.\nNYSSA: At least the air is breathable, even if it smells of smoke and corroded fuel cells. And, ugh. Rotten food.\nTURLOUGH: The music’s coming from down there. Looks like quite a crowd has gathered.\nDOCTOR: Some sort of marketplace? Or a fairground?\nDOCTOR: ALIEN-VOICED. VARIOUS LANGUAGES, INCLUDING IN ENGLISH:\nTRADER: #1: Roasted critch-nuts, two creds a scrape. Roasted critch-nuts...\nTRADER: #2: All the finest pole-skins and weave, get your pole-skins here.\nTRADER: #3: Valto fruit, minnow-whites, bittermeats and protein bakes...\nTRADER: #4: Fortune charms and poultices, amulets and talismans...\nTRADER: #5: Spacesuits, oxygen condensers, atmospheric filters...\nTURLOUGH: Extraordinary. There must be over a dozen different species.\nDOCTOR: At least, not including us.\nNYSSA: A technologically advanced civilisation, but materially impoverished.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed something else? The illuminations.\nTURLOUGH: Paper lanterns and oil lamps.\nDOCTOR: No electrical power. These people are suffering the same energy drain that we experienced.\nNYSSA: You mean, electricity doesn’t work here?\nDOCTOR: Apparently not. So they’ve had to get back to basics.\nTURLOUGH: Makes you wonder what they have to celebrate.\nDOCTOR: Maybe they don’t need an excuse. Maybe they need a distraction.\nNYSSA: The costumes, they’re like skeletons with skulls for masks.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A memento mori? Or a means to commune with ancestors, like New Orleans’ Day of the Dead.\nDANCER: (APPROACHING THROUGH CROWD) Pretty girl, you wanna dance?\nNYSSA: I’m sorry —\nDANCER: You dance, with me, have fun?\nNYSSA: I’m not really in the mood, but thank you. Tell me, what are you celebrating?\nDANCER: You don’t know?\nNYSSA: No. We’ve only just arrived. So what are you celebrating?\nDANCER: (LAUGHS) The end, isn’t it!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nTURLOUGH: The end of what?\nDANCER: Of everything, my friend! The lights are going out, out, out!\nDOCTOR: Yes, we've noticed, we had similar trouble when we landed —\nDANCER: Every night, stars in the sky, fewer than the night before. That’s why we come to Apollyon, for the carnival of death. You sure you don’t wanna dance, pretty girl?\nNYSSA: Yes, quite sure.\nDANCER: (LEAVING) If you say-so, bye-bye. Don’t let the Sandmen touch you!\nTURLOUGH: They’re celebrating the end of the universe. Well, I suppose it makes sense to have fun while you still can.\nDOCTOR: “Enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think.” Odd thing, this universe should have centuries left, but the way he was talking, you’d think it was only a matter of days.\nNYSSA: He said the stars were going out. Maybe it is.\nDOCTOR: So they’ve all come here to Apollyon. The land of the dead. Refugees from every corner of E-Space congregating for one final knees-up — (REACTS) Get down!\nTURLOUGH: It’s going to crash!\nNYSSA: No, it’s fired its retro-rockets. Just in time.\nTURLOUGH: I thought there was supposed to be no power here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR: That ship was venting fuel to slow its descent. It would only do that if it was under manual control.\nNYSSA: It came down somewhere over there, behind those watch-towers. Doctor. If that spaceship managed to land —\nDOCTOR: - then maybe Tegan’s did too, exactly!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5. EXT. LANDING AREA.\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING, LOUD WHISPER) It’s a spaceship graveyard!\nNYSSA: Doctor, over there! That’s the ship that Tegan was on.\nDOCTOR: You’re right. Looks like they managed a soft landing.\nWILD: TRACK OF SHOUTS OF ‘OVER HERE’, ‘THIS WAY’.\nTURLOUGH: Only by using the landing gear as shock-absorbers. It’1ll never take off again. No wonder they’re hauling it away for scrap.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: Over there. They’re preparing some sort of winching mechanism.\nDOCTOR: A treadwheel crane and lifting tower. I haven’t seen anything like it since the early middle ages.\nNYSSA: Presumably the only technology that still works —\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Keep your head down, or they’1l see us!\nDOCTOR: AND SEVERAL OTHER PIRATES.\nTEGAN: You could at least lend me a coat, it’s brass monkeys out here!\nBRANARACK: Cease your whining!\nTEGAN: Don’t you tell me to shut up, you overdressed Neanderthal!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nBRANARACK: (LAUGHS) Oh, the damsel is full of fighting spirit. Just what we need!\nTEGAN: You just wait, Long John Silver, I'll show you fighting spirit, right where it hurts!\nBRANARACK: (LAUGHS) Promises, promises! Alright, lads, bring her along! And try not to damage her too much, she’s our ticket out of here!\nNYSSA: They’ve got Tegan.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m not sure who to feel sorry for most.\nTURLOUGH: There’s too many of them for us to take on.\nDOCTOR: Not to mention the fact that they’re armed with muskets. We’1l just have to follow and see where they’re taking her. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6. EXT. CITADEL GATES.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: We followed Tegan and her abductors through the winding streets, following the bobbing glow of their oil lamps, taking care to remain out of sight. After half an hour we came to the ruins of an ancient castle. A high metal fence topped with barbed wire surrounded the crumbling remains. The only way in was through an iron doorway guarded by two robots resembling medieval suits of armour.\nSENTINEL: Only those with a tribute may enter.\nBRANARACK: This wench is my tribute.\nTEGAN: (STRUGGLING) No I’m not. Whatever it is, I have nothing to do with this.\nSENTINEL: The tribute is satisfactory. You may enter.\nBRANARACK: There you are, lads, told you it’d work. In we go.\nSENTINEL: Only one may enter with the tribute. No other.\nBRANARACK: No need to get all steamed up. — Alright lads, you heard our tinpot friend. You wait back at the Buccaneer, I’1l sort everything.\nPIRATES: (PROTESTS) Come off it, Cap’n Branarack! / You expect us to trust you? [ETC]\nBRANARACK: I can hardly leave without you, can I? Not that the thought would even cross my mind. I won’t be long. Captain’s honour!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nPIRATES: (RESIGNED CUSSING AS THEY DEPART) Alright, alright! / We’1l trust ye, fools that we are...!\nBRANARACK: Come on, wench.\nTEGAN: You'd better hope you’re not within kicking distance when I get out of these chains.\nBRANARACK: You ain’t getting out of those chains, not for the foreseeable. Now move!\nTEGAN: (PROTESTING) Hey!\nDOCTOR: I wonder what’s in there they’re so keen to protect.\nTURLOUGH: I assume we’re going to go in and find out.\nNYSSA: We have to get past those robots first.\nDOCTOR: Well, we could try asking them nicely.\nTURLOUGH: How can robots even function, without electricity?\nDOCTOR: Through a combination of steam and clockwork, apparently. Rather impressive, don’t you think?\nSENTINEL: Access to the citadel is restricted. Only those with a tribute my enter.\nDOCTOR: And if I don’t have a tribute, I can’t come in?\nSENTINEL: Only those with a tribute may enter.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nNYSSA: (TO SENTINEL) I am the Doctor’s tribute.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Nyssa!\nSENTINEL: The tribute is satisfactory. You may enter.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Just straight on down the passage, is it? Come on Nyssa, Turlough.\nSENTINEL: Only one may enter with the tribute. No other.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Turlough, would you like to go back to the TARDIS and wait for us there?\nTURLOUGH: Not particularly, no.\nDOCTOR: I thought as much. (TO SENTINEL) Hello! Turlough here is my tribute too.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nSENTINEL: Only one tribute is required.\nDOCTOR: But is there any rule saying I can’t have more? Consider it a goodwill gesture. A free gift!\nSENTINEL: You may enter with your two tributes.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, most kind.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. INT. PRISON.\nSENTINELS: CLANKING ABOUT — LIKE NUTS AND BOLTS FACTORY.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) We found ourselves in a long antechamber that stank of damp\nDOCTOR: straw. It was lit with flaming torches and lined with metal cages, each containing several captives in dirty rags.\nSENTINEL: Wait here with your tributes.\nDOCTOR: What? But I want to see whoever’s in charge.\nSENTINEL: You will. But first you must wait.\nTURLOUGH: And I presume any attempt to resist will be punished?\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to resist will be terminal. Enter the cage.\nNYSSA: But we’re looking for someone, a friend of ours called [Tegan]\nSENTINEL: Enter the cage!\nDOCTOR: I think we’d better do as it says.\nTURLOUGH: I’m beginning to think that this wasn’t a very clever idea.\nDOCTOR: Charming. It could at least have offered us a cup of tea.\nNYSSA: I can’t see Tegan anywhere, can you?\nDOCTOR: No. Although it appears we have a cell-mate.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nCHERRYANNE: (STIRS) You are looking for the woman who just came in?\nNYSSA: Yes, did you see her?\nCHERRYANNE: She was taken to be prepared.\nDOCTOR: Prepared for what? Oh no, let me guess. Sacrifice.\nCHERRYANNE: That’s what we’re here for. Some of us are volunteers. But most of us were dragged off the streets and brought here to die.\nTURLOUGH: But why? What are these sacrifices for?\nCHERRYANNE: We are the price that must be paid for freedom. We die so that others can live. I’m sorry. You will not see your friend again.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of that. Turlough, keep an eye out for our steam-driven jailer, could you?\nTURLOUGH: It seems to be busy re-filling itself with coal and water.\nDOCTOR: Good. Nyssa, what do you make of the lock?\nNYSSA: Rusty, nearly corroded solid, of a rudimentary design. (FX:\nSTARTS: PICKING LOCK) I should be able to unpick it with my brooch. Adric once showed me how.\nCHERRYANNE: You think you can get free?\nDOCTOR: Given time, I don’t see why not... Sorry. We haven’t been introduced. I’m the Doctor, this is Turlough —\nTURLOUGH: Hello.\nDOCTOR: - and my friend unpicking the lock is Nyssa.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nCHERRYANNE: My name is Cherryanne.\nDOCTOR: Delighted to share a cage with you, Cherryanne. Well, not delighted, but you know what I mean. You’re not from this world, are you?\nCHERRYANNE: No, my brother and I are from Bellezar. Our village sold all their belongings to secure us passage on a freight ship. For two months we were kept in the hold, huddling in the cold and dark with a dozen others from our world, half-expecting to be ejected into space at any instant.\nTURLOUGH: But you were brought here safely?\nCHERRYANNE: The ship crashed, killing the crew and most of the passengers. My brother and I, and a few others, survived and fled into the settlement, where we begged for food and shelter.\nDOCTOR: So how did you end up here?\nCHERRYANNE: Two days ago, I was kidnapped by a riot gang. My brother... I don’t know if he’s alive or dead.\nTURLOUGH: But why come to Apollyon? Why leave Bellezar?\nCHERRYANNE: Because of the great darkness spreading across the heavens. The hungry night. We knew it would consume our planet, and had heard tell of a way out, a gateway to another universe.\nTURLOUGH: A CVE! There’s a CVE somewhere on this planet.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It would explain a great deal.\nCHERRYANNE: I saw our home star fade away in a matter of seconds. Everyone on Bellezar, all those people...\nDOCTOR: I’m very sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nNYSSA: And so am I. My world met a similar fate. Doctor. I’ve unlocked\nNYSSA: the door.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. PRISON. [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Cherryanne, do you know where they would have taken Tegan to be ‘prepared’ ?\nCHERRYANNE: I don’t, the sentinels took her. I —\nSENTINEL: Alert. A holding-cage has been unsecured. Alert!\nOLD: TRAIN.\nDOCTOR: That didn’t take them long. Nyssa, take Cherryanne, find a way out.\nNYSSA: But Doctor —\nDOCTOR: I’ll find you, just get yourselves to safety. Go!\nNYSSA: Very well. Goodbye, Doctor, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Shouldn’t we run too?\nDOCTOR: Not if we want to find Tegan.\nSENTINEL: Halt. Do not move.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, we’re not going anywhere.\nSENTINEL: Why did you interfere with the holding-cage?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: To get your attention. You see, my tribute and I, we’re in rather a hurry, and we don’t appreciate being kept waiting.\nTURLOUGH: Or being treated like common thieves.\nDOCTOR: So if you could just take us to whoever’s in charge, that would be super.\nSENTINEL: Your request is granted. You are to be granted an audience with Science-tech Pallister.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Lead on, Macduff.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9. INT. PALLISTER’S CONTROL ROOM [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: LABORATORY. DOOR OPENS, DOCTOR AND TURLOUGH LED IN BY SENTINEL.\nPALLISTER: Ah. So you’re the one who broke from one of my cages.\nDOCTOR: You will have to forgive our impatience.\nPALLISTER: And this is your tribute? — What is he, ex-Terran?\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I’m not entirely sure.\nTURLOUGH: This is hardly the time —\nSENTINEL: Physiology approximates to ex-Terran. Life force register nine.\nPALLISTER: Nine? Yes, yes, that will be most satisfactory.\nTURLOUGH: Satisfactory for what?\nPALLISTER: Sorry, why would you offer a tribute if you didn’t know?\nDOCTOR: Turlough isn’t a tribute. We’ve come to offer you our help.\nPALLISTER: You’re a science-tech? Speciality?\nDOCTOR: Oh, practically everything. People call me the Doctor.\nPALLISTER: And what makes you think I need your help?\nDOCTOR: This laboratory of yours is extraordinary. All based around non-electrical technology. You even have a computer, after a fashion. A difference engine! Babbage never could get his to work.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nPALLISTER: Who is this ‘Babbage’?\nDOCTOR: And these robots are your creations, I assume?\nPALLISTER: The sentinels, yes. Designed and built by my hand.\nDOCTOR: Most ingenious. An inspired piece of engineering.\nPALLISTER: You are too kind, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I could suggest a few improvements, of course, but we’1l save that for later. I’m rather more interested in how you’ve managed to open a gateway to another universe.\nPALLISTER: You mean, the portal? Oh, I didn’t open it, Doctor. It’s always been present on this world, in one form or another.\nTURLOUGH: It’s the reason why electricity doesn’t work here?\nPALLISTER: Of course. Any energy on this planet is drained through the portal like water down a plughole.\nDOCTOR: But it’s not merely drawing energy from this world. It’s drawing it from this entire universe.\nPALLISTER: Indeed, indeed. According to my observations, we’re experiencing both dimensional contraction and heat death.\nDOCTOR: A simultaneous big crunch and big freeze.\nTURLOUGH: So what are you trying to do? Close the CVE?\nPALLISTER: Of course not, that would be quite, quite futile. No. I’m trying to open it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. EXT. PORTAL [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nWATERFALL: ROAR, BUT WITH SPACEY EFFECTS. PALLISTER WALKS UP,\nFOLLOWED: BY DOCTOR AND TURLOUGH.\nPALLISTER: Behold. The portal.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: It was a whirlpool, a swirling vortex suspended above the flagstones of an ancient courtyard. Viewed from the front was like looking down Niagara Falls; viewed from the side, it was two-dimensional, like an image on a cinema screen. In front of the portal was a structure made of wooden scaffolding, comprising of a railway track ending in a wooden ramp pivoted at one end like a drawbridge.\nPALLISTER: The citadel was built around this and other such portals, but now this is all that remains. Given sufficient energy, it can be temporarily stabilised to permit egress.\nTURLOUGH: But how can a spaceship fly through there, with no power?\nPALLISTER: The ship is winched up those tracks; then, once it’s in position, the ramp is tilted so it can descend into the maelstrom.\nDOCTOR: And return to N-Space.\nPALLISTER: In the vicinity of a G-type star, where it can refuel its solar cells. Not exactly high-tech, but it works.\nTURLOUGH: But the portal can only be stabilised temporarily?\nPALLISTER: The interface between the universes is weakening, growing ever- more unstable.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it would. The two universes are pulling apart.\nTURLOUGH: But if the portal is constantly draining any energy source, how can you stabilise it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nSENTINEL: Pallister. This human wishes to speak to you.\nBRANARACK: Aye, so I do.\nPALLISTER: Ah, Captain Branarack. — Doctor, Turlough, if you’1ll excuse me.\nDOCTOR: Not at all.\nPALLISTER: Sentinel one, make sure they don’t accidentally wander off.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nTURLOUGH: (QUIET) Doctor, that’s the man we saw —\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Yes, so Tegan can’t be far away.\nPALLISTER: So, Captain, is your tribute prepared?\nBRANARACK: I’ve strapped her in the induction chamber, as requested. She put up quite a struggle. Gave me a few bruises!\nPALLISTER: Full of life, that’s what I like to hear. Very well. If you’d like to return to your ship, I’1ll have it brought to the portal.\nBRANARACK: It’s already loaded onto the tracks and connected to the\nBRANARACK: winching-chain. My crew are onboard.\nPALLISTER: Excellent. Once you’ve rejoined them, I’1l be in radio contact.\nBRANARACK: Ha! The sooner I’m rid of this benighted universe, the better.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: So that’s what the tributes are for. To provide the energy to stabilise the portal so a ship can pass through.\nPALLISTER: There is a great deal of energy contained within the molecular bonds of all living tissue. It is simply a matter of drawing it out, by a process of magnetic induction.\nDOCTOR: Using human beings as chemical batteries.\nTURLOUGH: It’s obscene.\nPALLISTER: It’s a matter of necessity. We are no longer in a position to afford moral luxuries. How else are we to escape the death of this universe? Perhaps you would care for a demonstration?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. INT. POWER VAULT [FEW MOMENTS LATER]\nLED: ACCOMPANIED BY CLANKING SENTINELS.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: He led us into a vaulted chamber, like the nave of a cathedral. But instead of an altar there was an alcove, made of wire mesh and surrounded by heavy-duty power cables. And in that alcove, manacled by her wrists, was Tegan!\nTEGAN: Doctor! Turlough! About time you turned up!\nDOCTOR: Delighted to see you too. You haven’t been harmed?\nTEGAN: Apart from being trussed up in this thing, never better.\nPALLISTER: You know this... female?\nTURLOUGH: She’s an old friend.\nPALLISTER: Oh dear, that is inconvenient. You have my sincere condolences.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: You have to get her out of there!\nPALLISTER: She’s Captain Branarack’s tribute, and I fear that upsetting him would be more than my life’s worth.\nTURLOUGH: But you can’t kill an innocent person.\nPALLISTER: Unless you can provide a replacement, I don’t have a great deal of choice. Sentinels one and two —\nDOCTOR: Please, you needn’t arrest us.\nPALLISTER: Stand by. Break them both if they try to interfere.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nSENTINELS: As commanded.\nPALLISTER: Science-tech Pallister calling the Buccaneer. Are you receiving me?\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Buccaneer receiving, not very loud and not very clear.\nPALLISTER: All set for egress?\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) - just get on with it, you blithering dolt!\nPALLISTER: Very good. Stand by. Activating winch.\nDOCTOR: Pallister. Listen. There has to be another means of generating power.\nPALLISTER: (ADJUSTING MACHINES) I’m afraid not. Only organic tissue is a viable energy source. I wish there was some other way, but my hands are tied.\nTEGAN: Your hands are tied? What about mine?\nPALLISTER: I’m sorry. Your life — or rather, your death — will enable others to escape the collapse of this universe.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Look.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: Outside, the pirate’s spaceship was being winched up a funicular railway laid through the terraced gardens of the citadel. I looked out at the overgrown gardens, at the stone balustrades and the eroded, moss-covered sculptures of lions and ancient knights. And then I realised.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR: I've been here before.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: This castle. I’ve walked in its grounds.\nTURLOUGH: When?\nDOCTOR: In my previous incarnation. It was on the other side of the gateway.\nTEGAN: How does that help us?\nDOCTOR: (REALISING) Of course. The vastly accelerated rate of decay. This universe should have hundreds of years left if the CVE remained a constant size.\nTURLOUGH: But whenever the CVE is stabilised and forced open wider —\nDOCTOR: It hastens the process. And brings forward the day of reckoning!\nPALLISTER: What does it matter? All we can do is to try to save as many as we can. Ship in position. Elevating platform.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: Outside, the ramp beneath the pirate’s spaceship lifted off the ground and began to tilt down towards the portal.\nPALLISTER: Calling Buccaneer. — Good fortune, Captain. See you on the other side.\nTEGAN: Doctor, help me!\nDOCTOR: Pallister. Stop. You’re making a terrible mistake!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nPALLISTER: Too late, Doctor. But don’t worry. The process is very swift.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) Pallister pulled the lever, and the alcove containing Tegan began to flicker with forks of blue lightning.\nTEGAN: Doctor... please! Do something!\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION)\nDOCTOR: Meanwhile outside, the dimensional portal expanded until it was over forty feet high. And within, the whirlpool was replaced by the sight of a galaxy full of stars. The universe of N-Space.\nPALLISTER: Releasing winch-locks. (FX: LEVER PULLED)\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) And slowly but surely the spacecraft slid down the ramp towards\nDOCTOR: the portal...\nTEGAN: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34"

Apparently I have you to thank for saving my life.\nNYSSA: We knew you would be the next ‘tribute’ so, while Cherryanne went to find you, I went to the vault containing Pallister’s power generator and, well, sabotaged it.\nTEGAN: In the nick of time. I was about to be used as a human battery.\nNYSSA: What about the Doctor and Turlough, where are they?\nTEGAN: With Pallister. They offered to help him get his machine working again. In return for not killing me.\nNYSSA: Oh no.\nTEGAN: What is it?\nNYSSA: I only had time to fuse a couple of circuits, it won’t take them long to repair the damage.\nTEGAN: And once they’ve done that, they’re going to notice I’ve gone walkabout.\nNYSSA: Yes. We have to get out of here.\nTEGAN: Well, with a ‘sentinel’ to lead the way, hopefully that shouldn’t be too difficult.\nNYSSA: Ready, Cherryanne?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 42\nCHERRYANNE: (MUFFLED) I’ll give it my best shot. Walk ahead of me, I’1l try to look like I’m pushing you.\nCHERRYANNE: NYSSA/TEGAN: (SHOVED) Ow!\nTEGAN: No need to over-do it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. EXT. TOWN [SOME TIME LATER]\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: We made it out of the citadel easy enough, emerging into a icy, windy night. Once we were in the clear, Cherryanne removed her armour and hid it in a rubbish tip. Then she led us through the gaslit streets to her home, a small wooden hut with a tarpaulin roof.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. CHERRYANNE’S HUT [CONTINUOUS]\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) Inside, a frail figure lay on a mattress on the floor.\nCHERRYANNE: This is my brother, Raldarin.\nRALDARIN: Cherry — who are these?\nCHERRYANNE: Friends. This is Tegan, and Nyssa.\nCHERRYANNE: TEGAN/NYSSA Hello./Hello.\nRALDARIN: You were gone so long, what happened to you?\nCHERRYANNE: I was taken by a riot gang, trying to use me to buy their way off this world. But I escaped. With the help of Nyssa.\nRALDARIN: Then I am... forever grateful.\nCHERRYANNE: Now, you must get some rest. Have you eaten?\nRALDARIN: No good, food all rotten.\nCHERRYANNE: Then we shall get some more once it’s light. Now, wrap up warm. You’ve let the fire go out again.\nRALDARIN: I dreamt of Bellezar. So far away, but getting nearer.\nCHERRYANNE: Don’t talk like that. Now. Try to get some sleep.\nRALDARIN: You won’t go away?\nCHERRYANNE: I won’t go away.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: TIDYING THE ROOM, MOVING CONTAINERS, DURING THE FOLLOWING.\nNYSSA: Do you have any more blankets?\nCHERRYANNE: What you see is all I have.\nNYSSA: Then he can have my jacket.\nTEGAN: What about you?\nNYSSA: I’m young, I’1l be fine.\nTEGAN: You’re not as young as you look. Speaking of which. Cherryanne, I don’t mean to talk out of turn, but this guy is your brother?\nCHERRYANNE: Yes —\nTEGAN: But he must be.. fifty years older than you at least.\nCHERRYANNE: Looks are deceptive. He’s only two years older than me.\nTEGAN: What? Then what happened to him?\nCHERRYANNE: He was infected. With the entropy plague.\nNYSSA: The entropy plague?\nCHERRYANNE: The blight of this universe. On some worlds it is called ‘the Dusty Death’. On others it is known as ‘The Wasting’.\nTEGAN: And it makes people older?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nCHERRYANNE: It makes them decay. The process of ageing accelerated. Their skin grows dry and wrinkled. Their limbs become thin and weak. And then... well, just look at my brother’s left hand.\nTEGAN: It’s cracked, like a mud-lake during a drought. (DISMAY) And he’s lost two fingers.\nCHERRYANNE: He’s turning to dust, literally crumbling away, piece by piece.\nNYSSA: Oh no.\nCHERRYANNE: His hand was the first part of him to be affected, before it spread to the rest of his body. (SUDDEN) Don’t get too close —\nTEGAN: Why? What is it?\nCHERRYANNE: I don’t know whether it’s true, but some people believe it is transmitted through touch.\nTEGAN: Is there a cure? There must be a cure? Nyssa?\nNYSSA: No. I don’t — I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do.\nTEGAN: What? That doesn’t sound like you.\nNYSSA: Don’t you remember, Tegan? You’ve seen this before. You told me. This is what happened to the Monitor on Logopolis.\nTEGAN: (REMEMBERS) Oh no. Entropy.\nNYSSA: And now the same thing’s happening here, to this whole universe. The same thing that destroyed Traken. Tegan. This is how my people died.\nTEGAN: The Doctor said something about the CVE. About how it was causing all this.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nNYSSA: Yes. It’s draining all the energy, all the binding structure from this universe.\nCHERRYANNE: My brother isn’t the only one in this plague with the disease. They’re kept out of sight, considered unclean.\nTEGAN: And denied medical treatment?\nCHERRYANNE: Some say the only way of preventing its spread is to destroy the infected. Kill them and burn their remains.\nTEGAN: It’s barbaric.\nNYSSA: I recall things weren’t so different on your world, when we visited it during the time of plague. And I’ve seen similar reactions to Lazar’s disease and Richter’s. Fear of disease can lead people to do terrible, desperate things. Things worse than the disease itself.\nCHERRYANNE: Whenever a new spaceship arrives, Pallister has his sentinels check it for any signs of infection. If they find any, he’1l have the ship incinerated with everyone onboard.\nNYSSA: But you avoided that, because your ship crashed.\nCHERRYANNE: If my brother was infected, we didn’t know about it, he didn’t show any of the signs till later. He didn’t bring it here.\nNYSSA: If it’s as widespread as you say, it doesn’t matter how it got here. What matters is to prevent further infection, and to care for the infected.\nTEGAN: You haven’t changed, have you, Nyssa? After all these years, you’re still putting other people first — and yourself last.\nNYSSA: It’s how I was brought up. And I wouldn’t want to be any other way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. EXT. MARKETPLACE [NEXT DAY]\nDOCTOR WHO: TRADERS, BUYERS, ALIEN LIVESTOCK, COWS, SNORTING HORSES.\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) The next morning, Nyssa and I left Cherryanne with her brother and went to the marketplace to get food.\nTEGAN: . What are we going to buy stuff with? We haven’t any money.\nNYSSA: My hair comb. It has a few precious stones.\nTEGAN: But that’s... That must be the last thing you have from Traken.\nNYSSA: We don’t have any choice. Unless you have any suggestions?\nTEGAN: No. So what are we going to get? I’m not sure any of this is even edible. What are these? Giant conkers or sea urchins?\nNYSSA: Those look like Alzarian river fruits, they should do.\nTEGAN: Spider-free, I hope.\nNYSSA: (TO TRADER) I’d like these, please.\nTRADER: And what have you got for me?\nNYSSA: This. I hope it’1ll be acceptable.\nTRADER: Jewellery? Tell you what, you’re a pretty girl, the universe is about to end, why not. There you go.\nTEGAN: I can’t help thinking we could’ve driven a harder bargain.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nNYSSA: Next time you can do the negotiating.\nTEGAN: So what else?\nNYSSA: Clean water. Cherryanne said we should try the medical centre.\nTEGAN: (SHIVERS) How far is that?\nNYSSA: Not far, it’s near the landing site. Are you alright?\nTEGAN: Just a little cold. Can’t you feel it?\nNYSSA: Yes, I —\nNYSSA: RUNNING, CRYING, YELLING, SURPRISED ALIEN CHICKENS AND HORSES.\nTRADERS: /CUSTOMERS:\nTEGAN: What’s happening. An earthquake!\nNYSSA: No. I don’t think so. Look. At the fruit!\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) I turned, to see all the fruit and vegetables on the market\nTEGAN: stalls shrivelling up and rotting away before my eyes.\nNYSSA: Entropy. It’s affecting the food — the animals — (PAINED)\nTEGAN: Nyssa!\nTRADERS: /CUSTOMERS :\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nNYSSA: What is it? Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something wrong?\nTEGAN: (HIDING BAD NEWS) Nothing. It doesn’t matter. What just happened?\nNYSSA: For a few seconds, the rate of organic decay was increased.\nTEGAN: What does that mean?\nNYSSA: It means Pallister must have got the portal working again.\nTEGAN: Which means they must’ve found another tribute.\nNYSSA: Yes. (FX: OPENS PAPER BAG) Oh no. The fruit we just bought. It’s putrefied.\nTEGAN: We should ask for our money back. Hey. You.\nTRADER: (MOVING CRATES) What’s the matter? Can’t you see I’ve got enough to worry about?\nTEGAN: You sold us this fruit, it’s rotten.\nTRADER: Not my fault is it? It’s this place. Keeps on happening. My whole stock, ruined. I’1ll have to defrost another batch.\nTEGAN: What about my friend? She gave you her comb, she should get back.\nTRADER: Not my problem, love. No refunds, and that’s final.\nTEGAN: Oh no it isn’t. You’re going to —\nTEGAN: it\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nTRADER: Really? Picking a fight with a fella holding a meat cleaver? Doesn’t strike me as a very strong negotiating position.\nNYSSA: Come on, Tegan, let’s go.\nTEGAN: You just wait, mate. We’1l be back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. INT. MEDICAL CENTRE [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nSENTINELS: CLANKING ABOUT KEEPING ORDER.\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: The medical centre was little more than a tent, heaving with refugees of every race and species. A queue snaked towards a row of tables, while the steam-driven robots stood guard.\nNYSSA: (OVER CLAMOUR) Is there anywhere we can get clean water?\nREFUGEE: You're too late. Today’s ration’s already gone.\nTEGAN: What? How are we supposed to manage without water?\nREFUGEE: Same as the rest of us. Offer yourself up as a tribute for one of the transit-ships, they’1ll give your family food and water, and passage out of here, if you’re lucky.\nTEGAN: For some reason the idea doesn’t appeal.\nREFUGEE: Then what are you doing here? You see all these people? They’re not lining up for medical treatment. They’re lining up to offer themselves as sacrifices.\nTEGAN: They’re volunteering for Pallister’s machine?\nREFUGEE: Yes. The sentinels are here to check if we’re healthy enough. Most of us aren’t.\nNYSSA: The result of long-term entropic exposure.\nREFUGEE: Good luck, hope you make it. Don’t let the Sandmen touch you.\nNYSSA: Don’t let the Sandmen touch you. That man we met last night said the same thing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nTEGAN: Just some — (SEES SOMETHING) What on Earth!\nNYSSA: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Over there. The Doctor!\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: The Doctor was at the far end of the tent with ‘Science-Tech’ Pallister, who seemed to be giving him a guided tour. They looked far too pally for my liking.\nNYSSA: What’s he doing here? And where’s Turlough?\nTEGAN: Why don’t we ask him? After me.\nNYSSA: But if Pallister sees you —\nTEGAN: He won’t. He’s too busy with that bunch of lizard Hells’ Angels.\nNYSSA: Alright. Excuse me... excuse me.\nTEGAN: (OVER PREVIOUS LINE) Sorry, not pushing in, just want to speak to a friend —\nDOCTOR: (CAGEY) Tegan! Nyssa! What are you doing here?\nTEGAN: I was about to ask you the same question.\nDOCTOR: You can’t stay here. You have to go. If Pallister sees you...\nTEGAN: Not until you tell me what’s going on.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: There’s no time to explain.\nTEGAN: Come on, I know you’re up to something.\nDOCTOR: Please, Tegan. You’1ll just have to trust me.\nNYSSA: Doctor. Where’s Turlough?\nDOCTOR: (GUILTY) Turlough is.. fine. Listen. Go back to the TARDIS and wait for us there. — Here’s my key. Try not to lose it.\nTEGAN: Why are you so chummy with Pallister? He tried to kill me!\nDOCTOR: Because, Tegan, he’s the only one with the means to get us back to our own universe.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: You saw he could send spaceships through the portal. Well, I’m trying to arrange to have the TARDIS put on board the next one out of here.\nTEGAN: But I thought the machine needed someone to die to work. A ‘human battery’, you said.\nDOCTOR: I did. It does.\nTEGAN: And you’re happy to go along with that?\nDOCTOR: This is a dying universe. If we don’t want to die with it, we don’t have any choice. Pallister is our only hope.\nNYSSA: But what about everyone else in E-space?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Nyssa. I can’t save everyone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nTEGAN: No, all that matters is saving yourself.\nDOCTOR: Not just me. You, Nyssa and Turlough. Would you rather I left you here?\nNYSSA: Tegan, Pallister’s coming this way. We have to go.\nTEGAN: You haven’t heard the last of this, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure I haven’t. Now. Please. Wait in the TARDIS. It’s for your own good.\nTEGAN: Come on, Nyssa, let’s go.\nNYSSA: I can’t believe the Doctor would leave everyone here to die.\nTEGAN: Yeah, he’s full of surprises.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. INT. CHERRYANNE’S HUT [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: WIND.\nNYSSA: Cherryanne? We couldn’t get any food, but we collected some rain water, if we boil it — (REACTS)\nTEGAN: Oh no.\nCHERRYANNE: My brother’s worse.\nTEGAN: What happened to him?\nCHERRYANNE: You must’ve felt it, the portal opened. And he... deteriorated.\nRALDARIN: (GROANS) Water.\nNYSSA: We'll get you some water in a moment. I just want to look at you.\nTEGAN: Careful, Nyssa, don’t get too close.\nRALDARIN: Please. Water. (BRIEF GASP OF PAIN)\nTEGAN: His whole arm. It dissolved... like sand in an hourglass!\nNYSSA: The infection has progressed to the rest of his body. Cherryanne, boil the rain water.\nCHERRYANNE: Nyssa, are you — you look —\nNYSSA: Just do it!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nCHERRYANNE: Right, yes.\nNYSSA: Tegan, we’ll need something to use as dressings.\nTEGAN: What do you suggest? I only have the clothes I’m standing in.\nNYSSA: Exactly. If we tear off our shirtsleeves and sterilize them in the water, we can use them as bandages.\nTEGAN: What about us? We nearly froze to death last night.\nNYSSA: Once I’ve made Raldarin comfortable, we can go back to the TARDIS and get some more clothes, along with some food and medicine.\nTEGAN: I suppose that makes sense, though wouldn’t — [it be]\nCHERRYANNE: Shh! Sentinels.\nNYSSA: Coming this way.\nSENTINEL: (FROM OUTSIDE, AMPLIFIED, TANNOY)\nSENTINEL: The females known as Tegan and Nyssa are required. If you know their location, you will provide it. If they are in your place of habitation, you will surrender them.\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) It wants us!\nSENTINEL: (FROM OUTSIDE) Failure to co-operate will be terminal. Any attempt to withhold the females will be terminal. They must be surrendered!\nNYSSA: We should give ourselves up.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nTEGAN: What? And have Pallister strap us both in his juice extractor and use us as batteries?\nNYSSA: We can’t ask Cherryanne and her brother to risk their lives for us.\nCHERRYANNE: You don’t need to ask. You saved my life. Now it’s my turn.\nNYSSA: But we —\nCHERRYANNE: I’m not going to argue. Use the blankets to cover yourselves, Quickly!\nNYSSA: Alright, if you insist. Tegan?\nTEGAN: This isn’t going to work but I suppose it’s worth a try.\nCHERRYANNE: (WHISPER) It’s outside. Don’t move.\nSENTINEL: (FROM OUTSIDE, AMPLIFIED, TANNOY) The females known as Tegan and Nyssa are required.\nCHERRYANNE: You’re looking in the wrong place. They’re not here.\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to withhold them will be terminal.\nCHERRYANNE: I told you, they’re not here. As you can see, it’s just me and my brother.\nSENTINEL: If you discover their location, you will provide it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nCHERRYANNE: If I see them, you’1ll be the first to know.\nSENTINEL: Maintain surveillance. Search continuing.\nSENTINEL: SCENE CONTINUES:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT. CHERRYANNE’S HUT. [CONTINUOUS]\nCHERRYANNE: Alright, it’s safe to come out now.\nNYSSA: Thank you. You didn’t need to do that.\nCHERRYANNE: The Sentinels will keep looking. So if want to get back to ship, you should go now.\nNYSSA: We’1ll be back. And we’1ll bring medicines, food, water —\nCHERRYANNE: There’s no need.\nNYSSA: There’s every need. We’re not going to abandon you. Are we,\nNYSSA: Tegan?\nTEGAN: No, of course not.\nCHERRYANNE: Very well. Where is your spaceship?\nTEGAN: It’s not a spaceship as such —\nNYSSA: It’s not far from the main marketplace.\nCHERRYANNE: your\nCHERRYANNE: Then once you leave here, turn left, there’s an alleyway that goes most of the way there, and it’s too narrow for Sentinels.\nNYSSA: We’1ll be back as soon as we can. I promise.\nNYSSA: It’s clear. Let’s go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. EXT. MARKETPLACE [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: BEFORE.\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) We made our way back through the town as the afternoon turned to dusk and people gathered for the carnival of death.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) How come it’s getting dark so quickly?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Depends on the planet’s orbit of rotation. And its sun is a red giant, so not producing much heat or light. Come on! The TARDIS is just down that side-street.\nTEGAN: What? Where is it?\nNYSSA: It’s gone. The TARDIS has gone.\nTEGAN: Are we sure we’re in the right place?\nNYSSA: You can see the indentation on the ground. The TARDIS has been dragged away... towards the citadel.\nTEGAN: So now we really are stuck here. (SHIVERS) And that’s the whole warm clothes plan up the Swannee.\nNYSSA: The TARDIS was locked. I’ve got the only key, it can’t leave without us. We just have to find it, that’s — [all]\nDANCER: The Sandmen are coming! They’re here! The Sandmen are coming! Everyone! Run for your lives! The Sandmen are coming!\nTEGAN: (OVER PREVIOUS LINE) The Sandmen? What’s he on about?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nNYSSA: I get the impression they’re more than a ‘local superstition’.\nTEGAN: Hey, you. What’s going on?\nDANCER: The Sandmen are coming to town. If they touch you, you’re dead. One touch is all it takes.\nTEGAN: But what are the Sandmen?\nDANCER: Everyone knows the stories, the songs. And if you don’t, I don’t have time to tell you. (FINISHES) Oh my sweet mother. They’re here... they’re here!!!\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: I turned to see what he was staring at. Three figures, human but with spindly limbs, were walking down the street towards us, casting long shadows before them.\nRADIO: STATIC, PLUS RASPING BREATHING.\nSANDMEN: Dust to dust, sand to sand. (REPEAT)\nTEGAN: Those are the Sandmen?\nNYSSA: Tegan. We have to get out of here. Now.\nDANCER: You two wanna live, follow me. This way —\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: He ran towards an alleyway leading from the marketplace — and\nTEGAN: another Sandman emerged from it, reaching towards him! It was\nTEGAN: formed entirely out of dust, with hollow pits for its eyes and mouth.\nSANDMAN: (ANGRY HISS) Ashes to ashes! Dust to dust!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nDANCER: No. No. Keep away from me. Keep back! (SCREAMS)\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: The Sandman touched the man, and as he fell, he aged in an instant, his hair turning white, his body becoming a skeleton, dissolving into powder as it hit the ground.\nTEGAN: AIR, THE CRINKLING OF DRIED PAPER, THEN A PUFF OF POWDER.\nSANDMAN: (SMUGLY, WELL-FED) Sand to sand!\nNYSSA: Entropy.\nTEGAN: What?\nNYSSA: It drew all the energy out of him, all the structure, all the life-force. That must be how they feed.\nTEGAN: Great, so how do we avoid being their next meal?\nNYSSA: That passageway there, it’s the only way out. (RUNS) Come on!\nTEGAN: (RUNS) Oh rabbits.\nWHOOSHING: AS PEOPLE ARE DRAINED. CROSS TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23. EXT. CITADEL GATES [MOMENTS LATER]\nREFUGEES: (AD-LIB) Please let us in!/ Take me!/ Help us! [ETC]\nTEGAN: (NARRATION)\nTEGAN: We ran, until we came to a surging tide of refugees, gathered at the citadel entrance. We squeezed through the crowd to the doorway.\nSENTINEL: Only those with a tribute may enter.\nNYSSA: But there are Sandmen in the town! They’re killing people!\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to enter without a tribute will be terminal.\nREFUGEE: Take me, just let my family in!\nSENTINEL: You are unsatisfactory. You may not enter.\nSENTINEL: Only those with a tribute may enter.\nNYSSA: But if you don’t let them in, they’1ll all die!\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) People began to try to climb over the fence, into the grounds\nTEGAN: of the citadel.\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to enter without a tribute will be terminal.\nSENTINEL: SOME IN AGONY, SOME IN TERROR.\nSENTINEL: You will vacate the area. (REPEATS THIS IN B/G FROM NOW ON)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nNYSSA: It’s no good. We have to get out of here.\nTEGAN: But those robots, they’re shooting innocent people, it’s a\nTEGAN: massacre —\nNYSSA: We have to leave. Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24. EXT. STREET/CHERRYANNE’S HUT [MOMENTS LATER]\nTEGAN: Those Sandmen things are everywhere. They have the town surrounded.\nNYSSA: There must be something we can do. They must have some weakness.\nCHERRYANNE: (APPROACHING) Nyssa! Tegan!\nNYSSA: Cherryanne, are you alright?\nCHERRYANNE: I’m fine. I heard the alarm, so I thought —\nTEGAN: What about your brother?\nCHERRYANNE: He’s still in my hut.\nNYSSA: Then we should get back to him, if we can.\nCHERRYANNE: Did you manage to get anything from your ship?\nTEGAN: Our ship has been stolen.\nCHERRYANNE: Stolen? Then you couldn’t get any medicine, or —\nNYSSA: No. We’ll just have to do what we can without.\nCHERRYANNE: Well, I found these cloaks on an overturned cart. They’re not very warm, but they’re something.\nTEGAN: Never mind the cloaks. — Cherryanne, What actually are the Sandmen?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nCHERRYANNE: You don’t know? They’re figures from bedtime stories and folk songs. Parents tell their children, if they don’t behave, the Sandmen will come and get you.\nTEGAN: But these Sandmen are real.\nCHERRYANNE: They always were real. We discovered that on Bellezar, in the final days. They are a manifestation of the death of this universe.\nNYSSA: An embodiment of entropy itself.\nCHERRYANNE: Doesn’t look like they’ve been around here, fortunately. Raldarin? It’s me. Hello?\nTEGAN: (NARRATION) Inside, it was so dark, we couldn’t make out anything but the vague shape of a man with spindly limbs, shuffling towards us.\nCHERRYANNE: Raldarin? Is that you?\nRALDARIN: Something has... happened... to me. What has... happened... to me?\nCHERRYANNE: Oh no...\nNYSSA: We’re too late. He’s died. He’s died, and he’s become one of them.\nTEGAN: What?\nNYSSA: Don’t you see? This is where they come from. This is how they’re made. Raldarin’s turned into a Sandman!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nRALDARIN: (EFFECT INCREASES) Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

All I know is that my mother is alive and in E- Space.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor said that? He told you she was still alive?\nADRIC: Yes. Why? Is there something I should know?\nTURLOUGH: No, if that’s what he said. What else have they told you?\nADRIC: Tegan had got as far as the Sandmen attacking the settlement.\nTURLOUGH: Oh, right. Well, I wasn’t really there for that. — You remember how when we found Tegan she was wired into the induction chamber?\nADRIC: (BECOMING FRUSTRATED) Of course I do!

So the power is extracted using magnetic induction... amplified here.. and then outputted to here, where it stabilizes and dilates the portal.\nPALLISTER: Except it’s not working.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Still, one has to admire the workmanship.\nTURLOUGH: Have you thought about turning it off and on again?\nPALLISTER: Have you thought about remaining silent?\nDOCTOR: There must be over a thousand capacitors, transistors and valves. It could take us weeks to locate the problem.\nPALLISTER: We don’t have weeks. This universe doesn’t have weeks.\nDOCTOR: Not while the CVE remains open, no...\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, you said there might be another way of generating power.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Even in a dying universe, you could harness the force of gravity. Or solar energy. Even the thermodynamic collapse itself.\nPALLISTER: All considered, attempted and rejected. The only way out of this universe is by using this machine.\nTURLOUGH: And human sacrifice.\nPALLISTER: If there was an alternative, I would take it. But there isn’t. Besides, they’d only die otherwise.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: That’s not a justification. (SEES SOMETHING) Ah-ha!\nPALLISTER: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Those circuits have fused. That’s the cause of your problem.\nTURLOUGH: Well, that was easy.\nPALLISTER: There’s no way they can have overloaded, there’s an emergency surge cut-out.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure about that?\nPALLISTER: I built this machine, I know every inch of it, of course I’m sure! This can only be the result of deliberate sabotage.\nDOCTOR: You don’t think if someone intended to sabotage this they’d have done a better job?\nPALLISTER: There is no alternative explanation. Fortunately I have spares. (FX: RUMMAGES THROUGH DRAWERS FULL OF SPANNERS) Here we are! (FX: INSERTS CIRCUITS) Now, it should simply be a question of restoring the connections.

Where can she have gone-?\nPALLISTER: She can hardly have escaped on her own. This must be your doing. Sentinel one. Restrain Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Oh come on, there’s no need — [for that]\nSENTINEL: As commanded. (UNDER PREVIOUS LINE)\nTURLOUGH: (GRABBED) Agh!\nPALLISTER: Admit it, Doctor.

A lethal combination.\nPALLISTER: Sentinel One. Break the human’s arms!\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nDOCTOR: Wait! We got your machine working again, didn’t we?\nPALLISTER: Yes, and you knew where to find the sabotage very quickly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: But if we were saboteurs, we’d want your machine out of action for as long as possible.

I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.\nBRANARACK: Know me as Captain Branarack. These lads are my crew, of the Buccaneer.

Say hello, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Delighted to make your acquaintance.\nPALLISTER: You see, the tribute you provided became... non-viable, so this man is to act as her replacement.\nTURLOUGH: But I helped — (RESTRAINED, FX: ROBOT CLANKS) Ow!\nPALLISTER: Sentinel one, place him in the induction chamber.\nSENTINEL ONE: As commanded.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR: You really are without any moral scruples, aren’t you?\nPALLISTER: In my experience, Doctor, pragmatists live longer.\nBRANARACK: Putting the mindless prattling to one side for a moment, are you saying you can re-open the portal?\nPALLISTER: Now there’s a new power source in place, it’s simply a matter of activating the chamber. So if you and your crew would like to return to your ship —\nBRANARACK: No. Not until I’m sure this contraption works.\nPALLISTER: Very well, if you insist. A brief demonstration.\nDOCTOR: Pallister, don’t do this.\nPALLISTER: Don’t worry, your friend will survive. Wouldn’t want to waste a valuable resource, would we?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, help me!\nPALLISTER: Doctor, if you so much as move, I will order my Sentinel to shoot you.\nDOCTOR: I helped you repair your machine. I can show you how to improve it. Just let Turlough go.\nPALLISTER: You’1l forgive me if I decline your offer, but Captain Branarack requires a demonstration. Activating induction chamber.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nPALLISTER: Stabilising portal, dilating aperture. And Captain Branarack. I don’t like having a musket pointed at my head.\nPIRATES: DOCTOR/BRANARACK:\nBRANARACK: (IN PAIN) What’s happening, you scurvy dog?!\nDOCTOR: Entropic acceleration. He’s opened the portal without stabilising the interface!\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: As I suffered in the induction chamber, Captain Branarack and his pirates grew visibly older, their skin becoming weathered, their hair turning grey.\nPALLISTER: Sentinels. Enter power vault and restrain all intruders. Now!\nSENTINELS: As commanded.\nBRANARACK: Don’t just stand there! Fight back, you yellow-bellied poltroons! — Pallister, switch it off. Or I’1ll scalp you!\nPALLISTER: With what? Your gun’s rusted solid and your cutlass is so brittle it would snap if you used it to cut cheese!\nBRANARACK: (FRUSTRATED HOWL) I can still throttle you with my bare hands! (FX: GRABBED) Ah! Get off me, you metal blackguard! Get off!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 78\nPALLISTER: Sentinels. Destroy their weapons. Then secure them. If they resist, break bits off.\nSENTINELS: As commanded.\nPIRATES: (REACTING) What the-?/ By the stars!/ Me cutlass! [ETC]\nPALLISTER: Excellent. Then we’re done. For now.\nPIRATES: TURLOUGH/ DOCTOR\nTURLOUGH: At last.\nPALLISTER: Captain Branarack. Did I prove the effectiveness of my machine to your satisfaction?\nBRANARACK: I’ll eviscerate you for this, you perfidious mongrel!\nPALLISTER: I’ll take that as a ‘yes’. Did you really think I’d be so naive as to leave myself vulnerable to attack? I’d hardly have survived this long otherwise.\nBRANARACK: You have teeth and guile, I grant you. But we had a deal.\nPALLISTER: Which was negated the moment you came in here and threatened my life. I don’t appreciate intimidation.\nBRANARACK: You sanctimonious toad, nobody crosses Captain Branarack and lives!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nPALLISTER: Yes, yes. — Sentinels: take the intruders away to the dungeon and lock them in holding cages.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nPIRATES: (PROTESTING) Don’t shove!/ Tin scoundrels! [ETC]\nSENTINEL: Shall I remove the Doctor and his companion?\nPALLISTER: No. We have matters to discuss. — Release his friend, he’s served his purpose.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you. For a worrying moment there I thought you were going to have me executed.\nPALLISTER: I still might, if you or the Doctor cross me.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, we're as honest as the day is long.\nPALLISTER: I’m sure you are. Now, you said you could improve my machine.\nDOCTOR: I’d need to take another look, but yes, I think it could be made to run more — (CUTS SHORT) Turlough? Are you feeling alright?\nTURLOUGH: I’m sorry, I suddenly feel terribly — terribly... [faint]\nDOCTOR: Turlough! (FX: HEAVY ECHO) Turlough, wake up!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. INT. GUEST ROOM [SOME TIME LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: WINDOWS.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: I woke up with a splitting headache in a bare room with a jug of water and a stale loaf on the bedside. Outside the sun was setting in the starless sky. As I was eating, the Doctor entered —\nDOCTOR: Turlough. Feeling a little better, I hope?\nTURLOUGH: (EATING) Not particularly. What happened?\nDOCTOR: You passed out. After-effect of the induction chamber.\nTURLOUGH: (DRINKING) So what’ve you been up to, while I was out cold?\nDOCTOR: Trying to gain Pallister’s confidence.\nTURLOUGH: Did you manage to improve his machine?\nDOCTOR: No, unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics are irritatingly intractable. But I’ve come up with an alternative approach.\nTURLOUGH: Which is?\nDOCTOR: Reverse the purpose of his machine. Rather than prising the portal wider, it could be used to close it.\nTURLOUGH: Close it?!\nDOCTOR: Permanently. Cutting off E-Space and N-Space forever. This is the final interface. When this one goes, there’s no way back.\nTURLOUGH: Leaving everyone trapped in a universe with a few weeks left to live!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: No. The CVE is causing the energy drain. Once the portal is closed, E-Space should be good for a few more centuries, at least.\nTURLOUGH: That doesn’t sound like much of a solution.\nDOCTOR: It’s not ideal but it’s the best I can do. If we keep opening the portal the entropy will keep increasing. The more people try to leave this universe, the less time it has left.\nTURLOUGH: The more you try to solve the problem, the worse it gets.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. We can’t evacuate everyone, but at least my way those left behind will be able to live out the rest of their natural lives.\nTURLOUGH: But... you will still need a power source. Someone has to be in the induction chamber. Someone has to die.\nDOCTOR: Like I said, it’s not ideal.\nTURLOUGH: So if you do this, we end up stuck in this universe? For the rest of our natural lives?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. Before the CVE can be closed, it must be stabilised, so one last ship will be able to pass through it.\nTURLOUGH: And we could be on that ship?\nDOCTOR: You, Nyssa and Tegan could. Someone has to remain behind, to act as a power source and close the portal.\nTURLOUGH: You?\nDOCTOR: I can’t think of anyone more qualified. I was the one who got you into this mess. It’s my responsibility to get you out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 82\nTURLOUGH: But you could use anyone — Branarack, one of his pirates —\nDOCTOR: I’m not prepared to sacrifice the life of another.\nTURLOUGH: But you are prepared to sacrifice your own life.\nDOCTOR: I won’t die. All I’1ll lose is my freedom. The least I deserve.\nTURLOUGH: And Pallister’s happy to go along with this?\nDOCTOR: No. I’ve given him the impression that I’ve improved his machine. In return, he’s agreed to allow us to leave in Branarack’s ship. I had to convince him that I was willing to use another human as a power source, so I accompanied him to the town to select some suitable candidates.\nTURLOUGH: And did you?\nDOCTOR: They’re in the dungeon. Don’t worry, I’1ll make sure they’re set free, once you’ve gone.\nTURLOUGH: What about Nyssa and Tegan? Do they know what you’re planning?\nDOCTOR: Not yet. I spoke to them when I was in the town, told them to wait in the TARDIS. Hopefully they’1l have done as I said.\nTURLOUGH: Hopefully.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. You see, I persuaded Pallister to get his robots to fetch the TARDIS, and place it onboard the Buccaneer.\nSENTINEL: Doctor. You are required by Science-Tech Pallister.\nDOCTOR: Good news, I hope?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 83\nSENTINEL: Your container has been located and transferred to the spacecraft. Follow, I will take you to it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31. INT. BUCCANEER [SOME MINUTES LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: CREAKY.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION) The sentinel led us to the Buccaneer, still resting on the ramp in front of the Portal.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: We passed through the airlock into a murky, cramped control room littered with looted trinkets. It smelt heavily of stale sweat and corroded batteries.\nPALLISTER: Ah, Doctor. Mind your head. I’m pleased to see your friend has recovered. Tell me, what precisely does this blue box of yours contain?\nDOCTOR: Just some items of personal value.\nPALLISTER: Not very many, by the look of it.\nTURLOUGH: A few souvenirs of our travels in E-Space, that’s all.\nPALLISTER: Fascinating. Now, if you will excuse me, I still need to find a subject for the induction chamber. One of Branarack’s crew, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll meet you later in the power vault. Just got a few things to check first.\nTURLOUGH: He’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Good. (TO TARDIS) Nyssa, Tegan, if you’re in there, it’s safe to come out. There’s no-one here apart from Turlough and me. Hello?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 85\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think they’re in there.\nDOCTOR: No. They must still be in the settlement with that girl,\nDOCTOR: Cherryanne.\nTURLOUGH: So what now?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. INT. PALLISTER’S LABORATORY [FEW MINUTES LATER].\nPALLISTER: I would not advise leaving the citadel, Doctor. You’ve seen for yourself the conditions out there. If it wasn’t for the Sentinels, we would’ve been mobbed.\nDOCTOR: Then let us borrow two Sentinels, for our protection.\nPALLISTER: There’s no need. The Sentinels can locate and recover your friends for you.\nDOCTOR: You’re in radio contact with all the Sentinels in the settlement?\nPALLISTER: Of course. I can give the order right now. I’m quite keen to enjoy Tegan’s company again.\nTURLOUGH: I doubt the feeling is mutual.\nPALLISTER: What was the other girl’s name again?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. She’s called Nyssa.\nPALLISTER: Science-Tech Pallister calling all Sentinels on patrol in the settlement. You are to locate two females, known as Tegan and Nyssa.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nPALLISTER: Anyone attempting to obstruct your search or withhold them is to be dealt with in the usual fashion.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nTURLOUGH: Now what?\nPALLISTER: (FX: CHECKING EQUIPMENT) A disturbance in the dungeon. Sentinels, report. Report! Report!\nTURLOUGH: They’re not answering.\nDOCTOR: Maybe we should go down there and look?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33. INT. PRISON.\nDOCTOR WHO: CAGES. SENTINELS CLANKING.\nPRISONERS: (CRYING OUT, FEARFUL) Let us out!/ The plague is here! The plague! / Get away from me! Get back! [ETC]\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: We made our way down to the dungeon, to find the prisoners ina state of terror, heaving at the bars of their cages like wild animals.\nPALLISTER: What’s got into them?\nDOCTOR: They’re scared. Something’s frightened them out of their wits.\nBRANARACK: Pallister! You’ve got to let us out of here! In the name of the fire demons of Valuma!\nPALLISTER: And why on Apollyon would I want to do that?\nBRANARACK: One of my crew. He’s come down with the Entropy plague.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: I picked up a flaming torch and peered into the cage. One of the pirates sat in the far corner. Even as I watched, his hair snaked out of his scalp and his skin tightened over his skull.\nPALLISTER: Get back! Don’t let them touch you.\nBRANARACK: What’re you saying, man? You’ve got to let us out of here! Or we’ll all catch it. And you know what that means!\nPALLISTER: What?\nBRANARACK: You know what happens to those struck down with entropy plague. What they become. And then these cages won’t be enough to hold us.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: What’s he talking about?\nBRANARACK: Doctor. Do you want to stand by and let us die? Do you?\nDOCTOR: No. Tell me what I can do.\nBRANARACK: Let us out. Gavlar’s beyond hope now, but the rest of us are plague free.\nPALLISTER: No. You’re carriers. All of you.\nBRANARACK: Not yet. But if you don’t release us, soon we will be and then not even your Sentinels will be able to save you. Look at them!\nPALLISTER: What are you talking about? Sentinel five. Report status.\nSENTINEL: Communications malfunction. Corrosion of internal mechanisms. Condition terminal. (REPEAT)\nTURLOUGH: So that’s why they weren’t responding. They’re rusting away.\nDOCTOR: And so are the bars of the cages.\nPALLISTER: (TERRIFIED) They’re infected. They’re all infected.\nDOCTOR: You can’t be sure of that. You should establish a quarantine —\nPALLISTER: It’s too late for that. (TO SENTINELS) All Sentinels. On my word, you are to open all the holding cages and drive out all the prisoners into the settlement, do you understand?\nDOCTOR: But if you do that, you’ll spread the infection!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 90\nPALLISTER: We don’t have any choice. It’s them or us.\nBRANARACK: Just let us out of here, you flea-ridden cur! Gavlar’s changing. He’s changing!\nSANDMAN: Dust to dust!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, if he says there’s nothing we can do for them, and they’re infectious —\nDOCTOR: I can’t let you do this, Pallister —\nPALLISTER: All Sentinels, open the cages now! Get them out of here!\nPALLISTER: OF SANDMEN. UTTER CHAOS. CONTINUES INTO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34. INT. PRISON. [CONTINUOUS]\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION) The Sentinels unlocked the cages and the prisoners staggered free, stumbling towards us.\nSENTINEL: All tributes are to vacate the citadel. Any attempt to remain will be terminal. (REPEATS IN B/G)\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION) As the Sentinels forced the prisoners out of the citadel, we retreated up the stairs.\nPALLISTER: There. Now that should keep them out.\nDOCTOR: What about everyone in the settlement? What happens to them?\nPALLISTER: They are not my concern. And either you help me open the portal so we can escape this becursed universe, or you are very welcome to join them!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. INT. PALLISTER’S LABORATORY [LATER]\nDOCTOR WHO: B/G.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION) Pallister ordered his remaining Sentinels to secure the other entrances to the citadel while we returned to his laboratory.\nDOCTOR: Pallister, what exactly is the Entropy Plague?\nPALLISTER: The second law of dynamics as infection. Incurable and unstoppable, resulting in complete cellular decay and disintegration.\nTURLOUGH: You mean they turn to dust?\nPALLISTER: Yes. Unfortunately it doesn’t always prove fatal.\nDOCTOR: Like Branarack said. The plague transforms the carrier into something else.\nPALLISTER: A Sandman. A figure from folklore, but with origins in fact. They feed on energy, on structure, on heat and light. And if you’re so much as touched by a Sandman, you become a Sandman.\nTURLOUGH: And you released them into the settlement.\nPALLISTER: Which should give us time to get away.\nDOCTOR: But if you open the portal you’1ll accelerate the progress of the infection. You’1l make the Sandmen even more powerful.\nPALLISTER: As I seem to keep telling you, there is no alternative.\nDOCTOR: No. There is. We close the portal. Seal it off. End the energy drain. If that’s what’s generating the Sandmen, then if we close it, they should be scattered to the four winds.\nPALLISTER: And we will all be trapped!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily. To close the CVE, we need to stabilise it, so one last ship will be able to pass through.\nTURLOUGH: The Buccaneer.\nDOCTOR: But that will be it. The next time the Portal is opened must be the last. We go, the portal closes behind us, forever.\nPALLISTER: So long as we get away it hardly matters.\nDOCTOR: Of course it matters. There are thousands of people left in this universe. If we can’t evacuate them, we can at least give them a chance of survival.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) Science-Tech Pallister.\nPALLISTER: What is it?\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) Humans are congregating at the main entrance. They claim there are Sandmen in the settlement.\nPALLISTER: Unless they offer tributes, and are free of infection, no-one is to enter the citadel, do you understand? No-one!\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) They are climbing the perimeter fence, attempting to enter the grounds.\nPALLISTER: Order them to vacate the area. If they refuse, persuade them.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nTURLOUGH: But you did this, you are responsible. If you leave those people out there, at the mercy of the Sandmen —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nPALLISTER: The Sandmen have no mercy.\nTURLOUGH: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: Turlough’s right. You have to let them in!\nPALLISTER: It’s too late for that. They must take their own chances.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Tegan and Nyssa are out there.\nDOCTOR: I hadn’t forgotten.\nPALLISTER: If they are still alive, my Sentinels will find them. But in the meantime, we have preparations to make.\nDOCTOR: You agree? You’1ll use your machine to close the CVE?\nPALLISTER: I agree. One of my Sentinels can operate it, once we are safely on board the Buccaneer.\nDOCTOR: There’1ll be no need for that.\nPALLISTER: No?\nDOCTOR: I’m offering myself as tribute. If it means I get my friends home, it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36. INT. GENERATOR ROOM [LATER]\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor and Pallister went to the vault to work on the generator while I remained in the laboratory, staying in contact with the Sentinels.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) The females known as Tegan and Nyssa have been located.\nTURLOUGH: What? Are they alive?\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) They are both animate. They were with another female, known as\nSENTINEL: Cherryanne.\nTURLOUGH: Bring them all into the citadel through the west-gate.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? Hello?\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) Turlough, what is it?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan and Nyssa, they’re alive, and being brought here now.\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) Marvellous. Pallister and I just have a few finishing touches to make, and I’1ll meet you all in the power vault.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37. INT. POWER VAULT [LATER].\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: I waited for the Doctor in the power vault. A few minutes later he arrived, and then a Sentinel led in three figures dressed in hooded cloaks.\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Tegan, and, eYF...\nCHERRYANNE: Cherryanne.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I remember. — You’re all unharmed, I trust?\nTEGAN: Just about. We were in Cherryanne’s hut when her brother became one of those Sandman things. Then this robot turned up, grabbed us, and frogmarched us here.\nNYSSA: You should see it out there, Doctor. It’s like a war zone.\nTEGAN: Sandmen and robots killing people, people begging to get into this place.\nCHERRYANNE: It’s like the world is coming to an end.\nDOCTOR: Not just a world, the entire universe. It can’t have more than a few hours left.\nTEGAN: We can’t just pretend it’s not happening. Doctor, we have to do something!\nDOCTOR: Yes. That’s why I’ve arranged with Pallister for you three to be on board the last ship to pass through the CVE.\nTEGAN: I didn’t mean make a deal with that sadist! I meant —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Necessity makes strange bedfellows. The TARDIS is already in the ship. Once you’re back in N-Space, it will re-activate, and you’ll be able to contact the Time Lords. They’1l be able to get you all home.\nTEGAN: You’re talking like you won’t be with us.\nDOCTOR: I won’t. Someone needs to act as a power source.\nNYSSA: And that person gets left behind...\nDOCTOR: Yes. — So you see, that person should be me.\nTEGAN: Doctor, you’re not listening.\nNYSSA: We can’t abandon anyone! Not you, and not the people of E- Space!\nDOCTOR: Please, listen to me. Once the CVE is closed, the energy drain will cease and the Sandmen will turn to dust. This world will still have centuries left.\nTEGAN: Oh. Right. — Still, you’d never be able to return to our universe.\nDOCTOR: Rather me than any of you. And Cherryanne — you can go on the ship too, if you like.\nCHERRYANNE: Thank you. I would like that very much.\nNYSSA: No.\nTURLOUGH: Why are we still arguing?!\nNYSSA: There are people suffering out there, Doctor. Not just from the plague. From malnutrition, from exhaustion. We can’t just leave them.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: If you’re ever going to return to N-Space, we don’t have any choice.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. There is another way. I can be the power source. I should be the one who stays.\nDOCTOR: No, Nyssa. You have a son and daughter.\nNYSSA: Out of all of us, who can do the most good here? Me, Doctor. It’s me. I'll be able to save lives, to tend to the sick. It’s what I’ve always done. It’s what I was brought up to do.\nDOCTOR: I’m not going to argue with you, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: I can’t let you sacrifice yourself, Doctor. You have so much more life left to live. But me? I’ve lived a long time. Look at me.\nTURLOUGH: (NARRATION)\nTURLOUGH: As Nyssa spoke, she drew back the hood of her cloak, to reveal her skin was lined and her hair was streaked with grey. She looked even older than she did when we met her on Helheim.\nDOCTOR: Oh no...\nNYSSA: Yes. My rejuvenation has been reversed. I’m starting to look and feel my real age.\nDOCTOR: The effect of exposure to accelerated entropy.\nNYSSA: Exactly, Doctor. The same thing that destroyed my home planet, and now it’s killing me.\nTEGAN: But you can be cured. Once we’re back in N-Space, you’1ll be back to normal? Won’t she, Doctor? (BEAT) Won’t she?\nDOCTOR: There is no cure. It’s an immutable law. Entropy increases.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nNYSSA: Which is why I must stay, and you must go. Go and find my son and daughter. Tell them that I chose to remain here. Tell them that I love them, that I will always love them —\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, no.\nNYSSA: You have to let me do this, Doctor. You have to let me be the one who stays behind.\nNYSSA: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100"

I couldn’t abandon the people there, not when there was a chance I could do some good. But the Doctor did not agree...\nDOCTOR: I’m not going to let you do this, Nyssa. You promised your son you'd meet him on Maxis Realtor. If it wasn’t for me, you’d be with him right now.\nNYSSA: I don’t blame you, Doctor. It wasn’t your fault.\nTEGAN: You can’t stay here. Do these people really mean more to you than your own children?\nNYSSA: My children have lives of their own. They don’t need me.\nTEGAN: I don’t think they’d agree with that.\nTURLOUGH: Why does any of us have to stay behind? Pallister said one of his Sentinels can operate the machine —\nDOCTOR: So what are you suggesting? We use someone else as a power source?\nTURLOUGH: Yes! Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because, Turlough, it would be murder.\nTURLOUGH: One life for many. Think of all the people you’ve saved, all the people you will save if you get back to N-Space. And the same goes for Nyssa.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nTEGAN: I don’t see you volunteering, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: I don’t see you volunteering either.\nDOCTOR: Then who should it be? Cherryanne?\nTURLOUGH: What about Captain Branarack, or one of his crew? They’re murderers, we’d be doing both universes a favour.\nDOCTOR: All the time you’ve been with me, Turlough, have you learned nothing?\nTURLOUGH: I’ve learned that your life, Nyssa’s life, all our lives, are worth more than those of some bloodthirsty pirates!\nBRANARACK: (ENTERING) Is that so, boy? You’ll have to forgive me and my lads if we disagree.\nPIRATES: (ENTERING)\nCHERRYANNE: Oh no —\nBRANARACK: Grab them. And don’t let the Doctor touch the controls. Remember last time.\nBRANARACK: TURLOUGH/ TEGAN/NYSSA/CHERRYANNE/DOCTOR\nTEGAN: Get off of us!\nDOCTOR: How did you even get in here, Branarack?\nBRANARACK: Followed the two wenches, didn’t we? My lads made short work of the robot on guard. It was riven with decay, like everything in this festering rat-hole of a universe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nTEGAN: What about the Sandmen? I thought you were infected —\nBRANARACK: Two of my lads were. Last we saw of them, they were too busy feeding to bother with us.\nNYSSA: But you’ve all been contaminated. It’s only a matter of time.\nBRANARACK: Do you think I don’t know that? But once we’re back in our own universe, we’ll be cured, won’t we?\nDOCTOR: You can’t be sure of that. You might carry the Plague with you into N-Space.\nBRANARACK: You’re bluffing. And even if you’re not, it’s a gamble I’m willing to take. We’re getting out while we still can, aren’t we lads?\nTURLOUGH: You’1ll need someone to operate the machine.\nBRANARACK: We have all the help we need. — Alright, bring him in, lads.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nPALLISTER: (DRAGGED IN) There is absolutely no-need for this. I told you I would co-operate.\nBRANARACK: Yeah, we’ve already had a taste of your co-operation, Pallister.\nPIRATES: (CONCUR) Aye!\nBRANARACK: Unfortunately for you, we didn’t die how we was supposed to.\nPALLISTER: If I’d wanted you dead, I’d have ordered my Sentinels to kill you.\nBRANARACK: Bet you wish you had, now. How many working Sentinels have you got left?\nPALLISTER: A dozen or so —\nBRANARACK: Good. Summon them here. And don’t try anything, or it’1ll be the last thing you do.\nPALLISTER: All Sentinels to power vault. At once.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nBRANARACK: Captain Branarack and his crew are not to be harmed. Speak it!\nPALLISTER: Captain Branarack and his crew are not to be harmed.\nBRANARACK: This order cannot be countermanded.\nPALLISTER: This order can — cannot be countermanded.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nPALLISTER: They’re on their way.\nBRANARACK: You can order them to open the portal by remote control?\nPALLISTER: I can, yes. They are programmed to obey my every command.\nBRANARACK: Of course they are, that’s the only thing that’s keeping you alive. Once we’re safely on board the Buccaneer, you’ll give them the order to stabilise the CVE and send us through.\nPALLISTER: I’1l need to make some preparations —\nBRANARACK: Alright. But just remember. You’1ll be in the ship with us. So you’d better make sure we have a pleasant journey.\nPALLISTER: Once we’re on the other side, you’1ll let me go?\nBRANARACK: If I’m feeling in a good mood. So try not to disappoint me.\nPALLISTER: I won’t, I promise. — But we’ll need a power source, for the\nPALLISTER: induction chamber...\nBRANARACK: Yeah, well, we’re spoilt for choice, aren’t we lads?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40. INT. POWER VAULT [CONTINUOUS].\nBRANARACK: Five unwilling volunteers. Let us see. Ah, now this damsel looks familiar.\nTEGAN: You haven’t lost any of your charm.\nBRANARACK: But she’s already been subjected to the chamber. As has the boy.\nTURLOUGH: It’s been a while since anyone called me a boy.\nBRANARACK: You are to me. (TO NYSSA) Now, who might you be? Speak, wench.\nNYSSA: My name is Nyssa.\nBRANARACK: Hmmm. Bit on the old side. We could do with someone fresher.\nTEGAN: Seriously, with chat-up lines like that, it’s no wonder you have to resort to a bunch of unwashed thugs for company.\nBRANARACK: Silence. Or you’1ll start making me wonder why I haven’t had you killed.\nNYSSA: I volunteer. You can use me as a power source.\nBRANARACK: What?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, no!\nNYSSA: Just let my friends go with you. They have a container on board your ship. Lock them in it, and once you’re through the portal, eject them into space.\nBRANARACK: You had your belongings stowed in my ship? You were planning on using it to leave? Well, we’ll see about that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nNYSSA: But I’m offering —\nBRANARACK: No, you’re no good, there’s barely enough life in you to keep it open for more than a few seconds. But what about this one...\nDOCTOR: I was wondering when you’d get around to me.\nBRANARACK: You’re young enough, healthy enough. And the thought of you suffering is tempting.\nDOCTOR: Then what are you waiting for? Put me in the induction chamber.\nBRANARACK: No. You’re up to something. Some treachery. And I think you’d suffer more if you lived... and we used this girl!\nCHERRYANNE: Me? No. No, please —\nBRANARACK: There’s still blood in her cheeks, her skin is smooth as pearl. She’s barely been touched by the blight. Yes. She should prove an efficacious power source.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, if you want power, you should use me.\nBRANARACK: Then maybe we will, Doctor. You can be our spare. If the induction chamber burns her out!\nBRANARACK: Pallister, is your contraption prepared?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nPALLISTER: (OPERATING CONTROLS) It is. All that remains is for the subject to be placed in the chamber. So, if you’d care to —\nBRANARACK: Alright. But first, let’s just make sure you behave yourself, shall we? Hold him, matey.\nPIRATE: Yurr!\nPALLISTER: (GRABBED) There’s no need for this, I —\nBRANARACK: Well that’s where you and I have a difference of opinion. Order\nBRANARACK: your Sentinels to place the girl in the chamber.\nPALLISTER: Very well. Sentinel one. Place the girl in the induction chamber.\nNYSSA: Cherryanne!\nTURLOUGH: Don’t antagonise them, Nyssa.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nCHERRYANNE: (GRABBED AND HAULED ACROSS ROOM) No, please... please!\nPALLISTER: Secure her.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nCHERRYANNE: Please... Please stop. I.. don’t want to die.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nBRANARACK: Yeah well, we can’t always get what we want. Right, Pallister. Order your Sentinels to stand guard.\nPALLISTER: Sentinels. You are to remain here.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nBRANARACK: Tell them. No-one is to touch the girl or your contraption.\nPALLISTER: No-one is to interfere with the power source, the controls or leave this room. Is your projectile weaponry still functional?\nSENTINEL: It is.\nPALLISTER: Then if they try anything, shoot them. All of them.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nBRANARACK: Alright, lads. Put the Doctor and his friends over there.\nPIRATES: (AFFIRMING) Aye, captain.\nTURLOUGH: (MOVED ACROSS ROOM WITH DOCTOR, TEGAN & NYSSA) Alright, alright, we’re going!\nTEGAN: Why not just kill us?\nBRANARACK: This way, you have a front-row seat for my departure — and to see your friend die.\nDOCTOR: Unadulterated sadism.\nBRANARACK: I find it’s good for morale. Lads. Time we were gone. And don’t forget to bring our Science-Tech. Wouldn’t want to accidentally leave him behind, would we?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nCHERRYANNE: Nyssa, Doctor.. help me. Please.\nNYSSA: Try to stay calm, Cherryanne. The Doctor will think of something. I hope.\nTURLOUGH: Can’t we just rush the Sentinel?\nTEGAN: It does look like it’s falling to bits.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Worth a try.\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to interfere with the controls or induction chamber will be terminal. This is your first and final warning.\nTURLOUGH: Right. So we’ve proved it’s still in working order.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. INT. POWER VAULT [FEW MINUTES LATER]\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: The minutes slowly passed, with us powerless to do anything,\nNYSSA: and Cherryanne strapped in the induction chamber. Outside in\nNYSSA: the courtyard, the pirates boarded their ship with Pallister.\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Doctor? Still there, I hope?\nDOCTOR: Yes. If this is a social call, Captain Branarack, can you keep it short? It’s not a very convenient time.\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) (LAUGHS) Thought you might like to know. I’ve had your container thrown outside.\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind of you.\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Just in case you have any friends inside it thinking of leaping out and taking command when we least expect.\nDOCTOR: You really shouldn’t judge people by your own standards.\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Goodbye, Doctor. Alright, Pallister. Get us out of here.\nPALLISTER: (DISTORT) Very good. Sentinel. Elevate platform.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nDOCTOR: Listen. Let me take Cherryanne’s place in the induction chamber.\nPALLISTER: (DISTORT) Too late for that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand. I’m not human. I’m a Time Lord. You’ll draw vastly more energy out of me than you will a young woman.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 111\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Useful to bear in mind, if the girl dies.\nSENTINEL: Platform elevated.\nPALLISTER: (DISTORT) Buccaneer ready for egress. Commence induction.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nCHERRYANNE: (IN PAIN UNDER THE FOLLOWING) Please, no, make it stop...\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, the portal. It’s expanding.\nTEGAN: I can see stars! Millions of stars.\nNYSSA: N-Space.\nPALLISTER: (DISTORT) Release winch-locks.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nTURLOUGH: The ship’s sliding towards the interface...\nDOCTOR: They’re leaving.\nCONTINUES INTO: 112\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45.

Sand to sand!\nTEGAN: Sandmen!\nTURLOUGH: They must’ve found a way into the citadel.\nDOCTOR: Attracted by the portal. Don’t let them touch you, whatever you do.\nTEGAN: I don’t think they’re interested in us.\nTURLOUGH: They seem more interested in the induction chamber.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nSENTINEL: No-one may approach the controls. Any attempt to do so will be terminal.\nRALDARIN: Cherryanne? — It’s me, Cherryanne.\nCHERRYANNE: R-Raldarin?\nRALDARIN: Goodbye, my sister.\nSENTINEL: Any attempt to disrupt or disable a Sentinel —\nSLOWING: DOWN, SECTIONS STEAMING UP, HISSING, OVERLOADING.\nSENTINEL: - will be terminal. This is your first and final [warning. ]\nTEGAN: I don’t believe it. They just touched it and it rusted away.\nDOCTOR: Raldarin, be careful with those controls.\nRALDARIN: All must come to dust. To dust!\nTERRIBLE: GROANING, CREAKING HISS OF MACHINERY GOING AWRY.\nCHERRYANNE: (SCREAMING IN TERROR BUT NO LONGER IN PAIN) Raldarin!\nDOCTOR: He’s stopped the induction. Just in time for Cherryanne.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 115\nCHERRYANNE: (WEAK) Just in time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nTURLOUGH: But not in time for the pirates. Look!\nTEGAN: The portal!\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: I watched in horror as the spaceship slid down the ramp and towards the unstable interface — a swirling, churning vortex of unimaginable forces.\nBRANARACK: (DISTORT) Halt our descent, curse you!\nPALLISTER: (DISTORT) Sentinel, stabilise portal, stabilise, stabil —\nDOCTOR: Get down, away from the windows!\nTEGAN: /NYSSA/TURLOUGH / CHERRYANNE\nRALDARIN: (TRIUMPHANT) Dust to dust!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. INT. POWER VAULT. [CONTINUOUS]\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: An icy wind roared through the shattered windows, ripping into the Sandmen’s bodies. Dissolving them, scattering them, reducing them to grains of dust.\nNYSSA: Doctor, the chamber, Cherryanne...\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, get her out. I’1ll try to stabilise the portal.\nNYSSA: Right. (FX: BEGINS FREEING CHERRYANNE )\nTEGAN: What’s happening?\nTURLOUGH: The Buccaneer tried to leave through an unstable interface.\nTEGAN: I saw that. — I mean, what’s with the howling gale?\nDOCTOR: (OPERATING UNRESPONSIVE CONTROLS) The portal has been jammed wide open in a destabilised state.\nTEGAN: What does that mean? In words of one syllable?\nDOCTOR: It means... the rate of decay will accelerate if I can’t find some way of stabilising it.\nTEGAN: You mean, we’ll all fall to bits?\nDOCTOR: Not just us. Everyone in this universe. Everything in this universe.\nTURLOUGH: How soon?\nDOCTOR: Probably a matter of minutes. And not very many of those.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 118\nNYSSA: There! You’re free, Cherryanne.\nCHERRYANNE: (WEAK) Thank you, thank you. My.. my hand, what’s happened to it? It’s an old woman’s hand.\nNYSSA: Don’t worry, the effect is purely superficial. — Doctor, can’t you just close the portal?\nDOCTOR: Not without power. And first we need another ship to take us — to take you, through the portal.\nTEGAN: Another ship?\nTURLOUGH: There’s another on the tracks, it was probably due to leave after the Buccaneer. We could use that.\nDOCTOR: If we can get it to the portal before all of Pallister’s machinery seizes up.\nNYSSA: Using the machinery will only hasten the disintegration.\nTEGAN: Well, what else can we do? Get out there and push?\nCHERRYANNE: If the portal remains unstable, everybody in this universe will die. There’s only one solution.\nTURLOUGH: Cherryanne, no!\nCHERRYANNE: Someone has to be a sacrifice. (PUSHES TURLOUGH OUT OF THE WAY)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 119\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: Pushing Turlough out of the way, Cherryanne ran to the induction chamber and strapped herself in. Immediately it began to flicker and flash with blue light.\nNYSSA: Cherryanne, you don’t have to do this.\nCHERRYANNE: (PAINED) I’m too old now. I don’t have much time left. Let me die for something, Nyssa. If I save you, you can save others in my name...\nNYSSA: Please —\nCHERRYANNE: This is my decision. (GASPS, LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS)\nTURLOUGH: The portal, it’s stabilised!\nDOCTOR: The entropy’s reducing. Thanks to Cherryanne.\nTURLOUGH: And the winch is working. Yes! Here comes the ship now!\nNYSSA: (NARRATION) Outside, a large, battered wreck was hauled into the courtyard.\nTEGAN: We’re leaving here in that rustbucket? It looks like it could fall to pieces any second.\nTURLOUGH: It must’ve been caught in the entropy field.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, you'll be safe inside the TARDIS, inside the ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 120\nTEGAN: And how do we get the TARDIS into the ship?\nNYSSA: The sentinels. There may be some still working.\nDOCTOR: It has to be worth trying.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. INT. POWER VAULT.

Identify.\nDOCTOR: This is... Science-Tech Pallister.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) Your voice pattern does not match.\nDOCTOR: I have a cold. There’s a wooden blue box near the portal. Could you place it on board the ship on the access ramp?\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) (SCEPTICAL PAUSE) As commanded.\nDOCTOR: Right. Tegan, Turlough, Nyssa. Off you go.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: Into the courtyard, into that ship, and into the TARDIS. No time for discussion.\nTURLOUGH: Come on, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Alright, I just don’t like being told what to do. Nyssa?\nNYSSA: I’m staying.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 122\nNYSSA: Somebody has to be here to close the portal once the ship has gone through.\nDOCTOR: And that person will be me.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor.\nTEGAN: Well, I’m not leaving without you. Without either of you.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, please!\nTURLOUGH: There is a third option.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: One of the Sentinels could do it.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Good plan! (FX: OPERATES RADIO) Sentinels, respond?\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) Receiving.\nDOCTOR: Is my blue box on board the ship?\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then I want you here in the power vault. All of you. The\nDOCTOR: more the merrier.\nSENTINEL: (DISTORT) As commanded.\nTEGAN: How will they know what to do?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 123\nCHERRYANNE: (STILL IN INDUCTION CHAMBER; WEAK BUT ALIVE) I will be able to give them the order —\nNYSSA: Cherryanne...\nCHERRYANNE: Doctor. Show me what they must do.\nDOCTOR: This switch here releases the winch-locks. The ship will then descend into the portal. Then, once we’re through, order them to pull this lever. Everything has been set up. Just one pull, and the portal will close, seal shut, forever.\nCHERRYANNE: I understand. Now go! All of you! Go!\nDOCTOR: Alright. And thank you.\nNYSSA: Yes, thank you, Cherryanne. We won’t forget you. And goodbye.\nCHERRYANNE: Now all I have to do... is stay alive long enough.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. INT. SPACE SHIP [FEW MOMENTS LATER].\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS ON CRUNCHY RUST.\nTURLOUGH: (REACTING TO BAD SMELL) And I thought this ship looked bad from the outside. It’s like standing in a dirty oven.\nDOCTOR: As long as it holds together long enough to get through the interface, it hardly matters.\nTEGAN: We’1ll be inside the TARDIS when it does, anyway.\nDOCTOR: And there she is. (FX: PATS SIDE OF TARDIS) Now, what did I do with the key?\nNYSSA: Here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Nyssa. What would I do without you? (FX: KEY IN LOCK)\nTEGAN: And not before time. Look.\nDOCTOR: What —\nNYSSA: The portal’s destabilising.\nTURLOUGH: But if we go through that, we’ll be ripped to pieces.\nDOCTOR: Something must’ve gone wrong. Radio. Radio!\nDOCTOR: Doctor calling power vault. Cherryanne, can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: INTERFERENCE, NOT EVERY LINE CLEAR, JUST ENOUGH TO GET GIST.\nCHERRYANNE: (DISTORT) Doctor, I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter, we’re losing the interface —\nCHERRYANNE: (DISTORT) Too weak. Can’t keep it... Feel so weak.\nDOCTOR: You have to, or there’1ll be another entropic wave.\nTURLOUGH: And we'll be right in the firing line. We won’t stand a chance.\nCHERRYANNE: (DISTORT) I’m sorry... I can’t hold on.\nTURLOUGH: The portal’s almost completely destabilised.\nDOCTOR: There’s only one solution. One of us has to go back and take Cherryanne’s place in the induction chamber.\nTEGAN: You mean you, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Who else — (BEAT) Where’s Nyssa?\nTURLOUGH: She was with us. She was standing by the airlock.\nDOCTOR: It’s locked. Nyssa must’ve sealed it from the outside.\nTEGAN: Can’t you force it?\nDOCTOR: It’s rusted solid. To open it now, I’d need a blow-torch.\nTEGAN: But Nyssa’s out there!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. EXT. PORTAL.\nHELL: BREAKING LOOSE. NYSSA PELTS TOWARDS US.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: I dead-locked the airlock door, climbed down from the platform and ran back towards the citadel, the wind whipping at my hair, turning it completely grey, and then white.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. INT. POWER VAULT.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION) I made it to the power vault, where the three remaining Sentinels stood motionless beside the induction chamber.\nCHERRYANNE: (WEAK) Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Cherryanne! You’re still alive!\nCHERRYANNE: I tried to hold on, but... sorry. (DIES)\nNYSSA: It’s alright. You did your best. Time you were set free.\nSLUMPS: FORWARD ONTO THE GROUND.\nNYSSA: And now... to take your place.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Nyssa! Nyssa, can you hear me?\nNYSSA: I can hear you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Then come back to the ship. Let us out.\nNYSSA: No. Time for you to return to N-Space.\nTEGAN: (DISTORT) But if you do this, you’1ll never see your children again.\nNYSSA: Give them my love, Tegan. Tell them goodbye, from me.\nTURLOUGH: (DISTORT) You realise what you’re planning is suicide?\nNYSSA: Not suicide, Turlough. Self-sacrifice.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT)\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, please. If you do this, there is no way back. There will never be another interface between the two universes. I’1l never be able to find you!\nNYSSA: I realise that. But this is my choice. I can do more good here.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT) Nyssa.\nNYSSA: I’m needed. You know that, Doctor.\nNYSSA: Sentinel. Deactivate radio.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nNYSSA: Activate induction chamber.\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nNYSSA: (GASP OF PAIN) Portal stabilised. And.. release winch-locks.\nSENTINEL: Releasing winch-locks.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: From my position in the induction chamber, I watched as the spaceship trundled down the ramp towards the portal, towards the shining mass of stars that lay beyond in N-Space.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION) And then it was through, and gone.\nNYSSA: Sentinel. Pull main activation lever.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 129\nSENTINEL: As commanded.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: The portal shrank down to a point and disappeared with a blinding flash. And then, with shaking hands, I released myself from the chamber.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. INT. SPACESHIP.\nNYSSA: (DISTORT) I realise that. But this is my choice. I can do more good here.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (DISTORT) I’m needed. You know that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, you can’t do this —\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/ TEGAN /TURLOUGH\nTEGAN: The portal... I can see stars!\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa must’ve stabilised the interface.\nDOCTOR: Into the TARDIS, everyone. Quickly! We’re going through!\nDOCTOR: TURBULENCE, WRENCHING, RIPPING.\nDOCTOR: FADE OUT.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. INT. TARDIS INTERIOR.\nDOCTOR: (NARRATION) The moment the ship passed into N-Space, the TARDIS returned to life, the central column rising and falling.\nTURLOUGH: The power’s restored. Everything’s working again.\nDOCTOR: And the CVE’s closed. She did it. Nyssa did it!\nTEGAN: (WEAK) Doctor... I...\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nTURLOUGH: What is it... my head...\nDOCTOR: Entropic exposure. Some d-sleep and you’1ll be right as rain.\nTURLOUGH: Why is rain r— (FALLS TO GROUND)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55. INT. ADRIC’S HOUSE.\nDOCTOR: Then I set the co-ordinates, and, well, here we are.\nADRIC: So that’s it? You’re saying my mother chose to remain behind in E-Space?\nTURLOUGH: So that we could leave.\nTEGAN: If it wasn’t for her, we’d all be dead.\nADRIC: But is she still alive? Did she survive the ‘induction chamber’ ?\nDOCTOR: There’s no way of knowing for sure. But Nyssa’s made of strong stuff, she was only in the chamber for a few minutes —\nTEGAN: Both Turlough and I were in it for longer, and we’re still here.\nDOCTOR: So, yes. I think she’s still alive.\nADRIC: But trapped in E-Space. Forever.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nADRIC: In a dying universe with, what was it you said? Only a few days left.\nDOCTOR: That was with the CVE. With the energy drain removed, it should have years. Centuries. Nyssa didn’t just save us. She saved everyone in E-Space.\nTEGAN: Thousands of people will live because of her.\nADRIC: I don’t care about thousands of people, I care about my mother.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 133\nTURLOUGH: We’re all going to miss her.\nTEGAN: She meant a lot to us too, you know.\nADRIC: Why did she have to be the one who stayed? Why did you let her do this? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I tried to stop her. But it was her decision.\nADRIC: And now I’m never going to see her again. If I get married, she won’t be there, and if I have children, they’1ll never know their grandmother. — There should have been another way!\nDOCTOR: Don’t you think I don’t know that? Don’t you think that if there was the slightest chance of getting Nyssa back I would take it? But there isn’t. And I’m sorry. All I can say is I’m sorry, and I will regret this for as long as I live.\nADRIC: Just go. All of you. You’ve done enough damage to my life, to my sister’s life, to my mother’s life. I wish she’d never met you on Helheim, all those years ago. Just go. Leave me alone.\nDOCTOR: Adric —\nADRIC: Go!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. EXT. GARDENS.\nDOCTOR WHO: LAUGHTER.\nNYSSA: (NARRATION)\nNYSSA: After the CVE closed, all the Sandmen in the settlement turned to dust. Then it was left to those that had survived to try to rebuild, knowing that the final way out of E-Space had been lost.\nNYSSA: In the beginning, life was difficult. There was hardship, disease and disorder, but soon things improved as it was realised that the curse of E-Space had been lifted. Food no longer rotted in a matter of hours, metal no longer rusted. The rate of decay had been restored to normal. Giving people a chance of life, to plant crops, to look to the future. And even as hope returned, the light of the sun brightened, turning from dark red to brilliant white.\nNYSSA: That was ten years ago. Now, things on Apollyon are very different. The wilderness around the castle is full of fields. The settlement has been replaced by a thriving town filled with the sound of industry and children’s laughter.\nNYSSA: Of course, everybody knows this universe is still dying. But if anything, that knowledge drives them on, to make the most of what time they have left.\nNYSSA: As for me. After the hardship of the early years ended, I spent my time teaching others how to treat the sick, passing on what knowledge I had learned. But now my work is done, and I spend my days tending the gardens. Which now blossom and bloom with flowers, the air thick with scent like the groves back on Traken. That’s how I will spend my old age, which even now is creeping up on me like a shadow.\nNYSSA: A shadow cast by the sunshine, in my garden at the end of the universe.\nNYSSA: I never got to say goodbye to you, Adric, or your sister Neeka, which is why I’m writing you this letter. Not that you’1ll ever be able to read it, but just to put the words down on paper. I’m so sorry I broke my promise to you and that I missed so much of your childhoods. But I know you have made lives for yourselves now, and hope you have found love and happiness. You may even have children. I hope you do, because then you’1l know how precious you are to me, how much I delighted in seeing your first smiles, hearing your first words. And that bringing you both into the world is the best thing I have ever done. So no regrets, just memories of happy times.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ENTROPY PLAGUE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: I expect the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough have come to tell you what happened to me. Please don’t be angry with them. And please try to forgive me, as I try to forgive myself.\nDOCTOR WHO: One last thing. Last night, just before the dawn, the bells rang out across the town. There were cries, people shouting, to look up, into the night. Because there, in the middle of the endless blackness, was a new star. A star that had never been there before. So maybe this universe does have a future after all.\nDOCTOR WHO: That’s all I have to say, as I write this, gazing out across my gardens, towards the setting sun. Goodbye. Goodbye, Turlough. I hope you find the peace of mind you’re looking for. Goodbye, Tegan, my greatest friend. Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you for all the adventures. To have seen so much, I feel my life has been blessed.\nDOCTOR WHO: And goodbye, Neeka, my beautiful daughter and Adric, my handsome son. You’ve made me proud, and I will think of you always, as I hope you will think of me. I love you both. Goodbye, forever. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE END"
