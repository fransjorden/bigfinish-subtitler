One Zero Zero, Seven Four Two. Stand forward.\nSTEWARD: STANDARD PROCEDURE TO BE GOT THROUGH BEFORE LUNCH.\nGREEL: Ragnar Crezzen, you are found guilty of the attempted murder of a government official of the Supreme Alliance of Eastern States.\nRAGNAR: (QUIETLY) People have to know.\nSTEWARD: Quiet.\nGREEL: The subversive actions of Earth Free Media have imperilled the security of the Alliance. Such crimes are punishable by termination.\nRAGNAR: In your experiment camps, Greel? In the Dead Zone? How many victims now?\nSTEWARD: Be quiet.\nRAGNAR: How many others have you sent to the time chambers?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 3\nGREEL: But... at this time of disturbance and unrest, let us be seen to be lenient. The death sentence is reprieved. Ragnar Crezzen, you will be transported for life to a work group in the Outer Colonies.\nRAGNAR: But that’s not what happens, is it? That’s just for show, for the official bulletins. I know my future. It’s already happened!\nGREEL: Take him down.\nRAGNAR: You’re the Butcher, Greel! (LED AWAY BY GUARDS, STRUGGLING) One day you’1ll drown in your victims’ blood!\nSTEWARD: (CALLING) Next prisoner. Stand forward.\nRAGNAR: (OUTSIDE) You’re the Butcher!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 4\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 2. INT. FINDECKER’S LAB\nGUARD: Delivery of Prisoner One Zero Zero, Seven Four Two.\nFINDECKER: (COLD, SLIGHTLY THROATY ALIEN, PRECISE AND FAST) Place him in the projection chamber.\nRAGNAR: (SHOCKED) Findecker! It’s you... !\nFINDECKER: How fascinating. The human propensity for distress seems boundless and so self-indulgent. Restrain him.\nFINDECKER: EXITS, DOOR CLANKS SHUT THROUGH:\nFINDECKER: Don’t struggle, please. Your suffering will be quite extensive enough without compounding your injury.\nRAGNAR: (HALF CHOKED) I came to find you. I was going to kill you. For Sasha’s sake!\nFINDECKER: Sasha? Oh, yes, of course. (WITH RELISH) Sasha. I remember...\nFINDECKER: . Prisoner “One Zero Zero, Seven Four Two” - because that’s all you are now. It’s too late for vengeance, I’m afraid.\nRAGNAR: I knew that.\nFINDECKER: But you’re still an invaluable part of my research. So thank you, Ragnar Crezzen. Your circle is complete.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3. INT. TARDIS — TEGAN & NYSSA’S BEDROOM\nNYSSA: Camel racing? What are camels?\nTEGAN: Big... lopey.. sort of like a double-decker horse with a hump.\nNYSSA: (AMUSED) I see.\nTEGAN: And if the Doctor gets it right, we might be home in time for shearing.\nNYSSA: That sounds ominous. Do the camels object?\nTEGAN: Now that would be worth seeing. No. It’s the sheep that get sheared. For wool. On my Dad’s station outside Toowoomba.\nNYSSA: Ah, that explains it. Natural fibre for clothing.\nDOCTOR: Actually, Nyssa, camel wool is used by the Bedouin to keep out the heat. Can I come in?\nTEGAN: Have you been earwigging?\nDOCTOR: Not from choice. You’re so excited, I could hear you from halfway down the corridor.\nTEGAN: So could we do it, do you think? Be home in time for shearing?\nDOCTOR: Which would be...?\nTEGAN: Early June.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’ll try.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 6\nTEGAN: Tell you what. Turlough shearing a bolshy Merino. That’s something I’d pay to see!\nNYSSA: (TO DOCTOR) She’s excited.\nDOCTOR: I can tell.\nTEGAN: It’ll be great. And then we can drive down to Brizzie.\nDOCTOR: That’s Brisbane, of course.\nTEGAN: There’s a whole load of places I’m taking you. It’s where I went to school.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. I look forward to it.\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Turlough. Come in. Tegan’s planning our itinerary.\nTEGAN: (TO TURLOUGH) Fancy a spot of sheep-shearing?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, I think you should come and look at the console. It’s making... “juddering” noises.\nDOCTOR: Juddering?\nTURLOUGH: Like when a car’s about to stall?\nDOCTOR: You'd better show me. (FX: THEY DEPART.)\nNYSSA: Oh, no. Not now.\nTEGAN: I don’t believe it. Do you think, just for once, he could fly this old crate properly?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nTURLOUGH: There! See what I mean?\nDOCTOR: (AT CONSOLE) I don’t like the sound of that. Something’s thrown the drive system out of phase.\nTURLOUGH: The TARDIS certainly picks its moments, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Not always. We seem to have hit a field of turbulence in the vortex.\nDOCTOR: See that? The quantum pressure outside’s dropping like a stone.\nNYSSA: (WALKING IN, FOLLOWED BY TEGAN) What’s happening?\nTEGAN: I might have known it. Batten down the hatches!\nDOCTOR: Just a bit choppy out there, that’s all. Nothing to worry about.\nTEGAN: Oh, yeah? Sounds like engine trouble to me.\nNYSSA: (TO DOCTOR) Is there somewhere we can put down?\nTURLOUGH: Sooner rather than later, preferably?\nTURLOUGH: ROOM.\nNYSSA: Look out!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 8\nTURLOUGH: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Get away from that, all of you!\nTEGAN: It’s like a curtain of light!\nDOCTOR: I said, keep clear!\nDOCTOR: ITSELF BACK AT THEM.\nTURLOUGH: Sooner rather than later preferably.\nTEGAN: Sounds like engine trouble to me.\nTURLOUGH: What’s happening?!\nNYSSA: Is there somewhere we can put down?\nNYSSA: Some sort of energy beam! It’s slicing the ship in two!\nDOCTOR: It’s splintering reality! Nyssa, Turlough — come around to this side of the console!\nDOCTOR: Nothing to worry about.\nNYSSA: We can’t!\nTEGAN: Sounds like engine trouble to me.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa! Hold on to me!\nNYSSA: Is there somewhere we can put down?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 9\nNYSSA: (FURTHER AWAY) We’re cut off! Doctor!\nTEGAN: Where are you?! Nyssa!!!\nTURLOUGH: (FURTHER AWAY) Nyssa! Over here!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa! Turlough! Come towards my voice!\nNYSSA: (FAR OFF) Doctor! Help me!\nDOCTOR: Reach out, Nyssa! Reach out and take my hand!\nDOCTOR: NYSSA & TURLOUGH (FADING AWAY) Doctov...!\nDOCTOR: EXISTENCE. NORMAL TARDIS HUM.\nTEGAN: (SHAKEN) Nyssa? Turlough? (BEAT) Doctor, they’ve gone!\nDOCTOR: I know.\nDOCTOR: Reality was breached. That energy beam was carving up the ship’s dimensions.\nTEGAN: Breached? (SCARED) What about Nyssa and Turlough?\nDOCTOR: (GRAVELY) Tegan... they may have been torn out of the TARDIS’s internal continuum.\nTEGAN: But we were in flight. They could be anywhere. They could even be... [dead. ]\nDOCTOR: First we must check the ship’s integrity. And before you ask, Tegan, I don’t know where they are. Or when. Or what that energy beam was. But I promise you, we’re going to find out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE (BHUTAN)\nDOCTOR WHO: TURLOUGH’S FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH IN THE SNOW. THEY ARE LOST AND SHIVERING. CONVERSATIONS ARE BREATHLESS AND GASPING.\nNYSSA: Turlough. How much further?\nTURLOUGH: As far as the trees. We can shelter there.\nNYSSA: Not too far. For when the Doctor comes looking for us.\nTURLOUGH: If the TARDIS is still in one piece. (BEAT) Sorry. But we have to reach cover.\nNYSSA: Turlough? I can’t feel my fingers.\nTURLOUGH: Not far now. Keep going. The snow’s not so deep here.\nNYSSA: When you stop shivering. That’s when you’re in trouble.\nTURLOUGH: That’s good to know. Nearly there.\nNYSSA: Wait.\nTURLOUGH: No, keep going.\nNYSSA: There’s something... over there. Lying in the snow.\nTURLOUGH: It’s just a rock. We need to get under shelter.\nNYSSA: I have to be sure.\nTURLOUGH: Please come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL)\nNYSSA: We can’t... we can’t just leave someone.\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, come back... Nyssa!\nTURLOUGH: Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: (ANGRY) They could be anywhere? I thought they were out in the Time Vortex!\nDOCTOR: That’s one possibility.\nTEGAN: Then can’t we circle back to where they went over the side, or something?\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately it doesn’t work like that. (REACHING ACROSS) Excuse me.\nTEGAN: sorry.\nDOCTOR: The Vortex is endlessly shifting. There’s no constant. Nowhere\nDOCTOR: to throw a lifebelt. Anyway, the incursion of that energy beam means they could have been thrown directly into the continuum.\nTEGAN: Oh. But that’s good, right? Somewhere solid we can reach.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Or not. Come on... respond!\nTEGAN: But that takes us back to “could be anywhere”. They could be\nTEGAN: dead by now!\nDOCTOR: Tegan, I’m doing my best.\nTEGAN: sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR: The energy beam left residues in the ship. And if we can locate its source...\nTEGAN: You’re already trying that, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Amongst other things.\nDOCTOR: Ah... intriguing.\nTEGAN: Well?\nDOCTOR: The beam was composed of zygma energy.\nTEGAN: This is me you’re talking to.\nDOCTOR: It’s a notoriously tricky source of radiation. The double nexus particle — one half is in the solid universe, but its mirror nucleus exists outside time and space altogether. It’s often mistaken as a vital component of time travel.\nTEGAN: But if they’re linked... couldn’t we latch onto the half that zapped us.. the bit in the vortex...\nDOCTOR: . and piggyback into the continuum? Yes, that’s what I was hoping.\nTEGAN: And will it get Nyssa and Turlough back?\nDOCTOR: I’m trying, Tegan. That’s all I can do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE (BHUTAN)\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Nyssa, hang on.\nNYSSA: It’s a woman.\nTURLOUGH: Be careful.\nNYSSA: She’s cut a furrow right through the snow. As if she’d been shot out of something.\nTURLOUGH: She can’t have survived.\nNYSSA: No. She’s frozen solid. I’m sorry.\nTURLOUGH: Ugh... her face. She’s.. withered.\nNYSSA: Desiccated.\nTURLOUGH: (BEAT) Well... sorry and everything, but we need these.\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nTURLOUGH: Clothes. We need them.\nNYSSA: (SPOTTING SOMETHING SCARY) Turlough...\nTURLOUGH: I’m being practical, Nyssa. We’1ll both be joining her if we don’t help ourselves.\nNYSSA: No. I meant over there. Another body.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 15\nNYSSA: And more of them that way.\nTURLOUGH: Where have we landed up? In some sort of graveyard?\nNYSSA: I don’t know.\nTURLOUGH: (RETURNING TO BODY) Come on. We need these clothes.\nTURLOUGH: SCOURGED THE TARDIS.\nNYSSA: Look out!\nTURLOUGH: Another one. They’re dumping them here.\nNYSSA: The air opened up and he just... fell through.\nTURLOUGH: He’s still alive. Come on.\nTURLOUGH: HE WAS YOUNG RAGNAR. THEN HE WAS THROWN THREE YEARS BACK IN TIME AND THE SHOCK HAS REDUCED HIM TO A HUSK.\nHUSK RAGNAR: (GROANS. IN PAIN. EVERY WORD A CROAKED EFFORT) There you are.\nNYSSA: Are you hurt? What happened? Where did you come from?\nHUSK RAGNAR: I knew you’d be here. Waiting.\nTURLOUGH: Waiting?\nNYSSA: I’m Nyssa and he’s...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 16\nHUSK RAGNAR: Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nHUSK RAGNAR: (WINCES) Everything goes round.\nTURLOUGH: How can you know us? Who are you?\nHUSK RAGNAR: It’s three years ago, isn’t it? He’s thrown me back three years.\nNYSSA: He’s rambling.\nHUSK RAGNAR: (SHOCKED) My hands... What’s he done to me? That monster Findecker. What about my face? How old do I look? How old?!\nTURLOUGH: (AWKWARD) You’re not exactly young.\nHUSK RAGNAR: (GROANS) I was twenty-three. He stole my future.\nNYSSA: We can’t stay out in the open. The trees aren’t far.\nHUSK RAGNAR: Twenty three... that’s all...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. TARDIS -— CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: That’s it!\nTEGAN: You found the source of the Zygma beam?\nDOCTOR: Just waiting for the co-ordinates. But if we’re going to find Nyssa and Turlough, we’ll need to know where it was directed.\nTEGAN: Directed? Like a weapon?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think we were under fire. That’s not what Zygma radiation’s used for.\nTEGAN: Well, what then? Come on. Don’t clam up on me now.\nDOCTOR: Ah. The co-ordinates.\nTEGAN: You’re changing the subject.\nDOCTOR: (OMINOUS) It’s what I was afraid of. Earth. In the fifty-first century.\nTEGAN: Strewth, that’s a long haul. But at least the air will be breathable... won’t it?\nDOCTOR: (LYING) Yes, yes. It’1ll be fine.\nTEGAN: Now you’re scaring me. What’s wrong?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just find Nyssa and Turlough, shall we? The sooner the better.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE (BHUTAN)\nDOCTOR WHO: CARRY RAGNAR UNDER THE TREES.\nNYSSA: (EFFORT, HAULING RAGNAR) We’1ll be out of the wind under the trees.\nTURLOUGH: (EFFORT) It’ll just take longer for us to freeze.\nNYSSA: Careful.\nTURLOUGH: He’s heavy.\nTURLOUGH: AND WHUMPFS INTO THE SNOW. THEN ANOTHER.\nNYSSA: More of them. More people.\nTURLOUGH: More bodies. They’re raining down out there.\nHUSK RAGNAR: (EXHAUSTED WHISPER) Findecker’s having a busy day.\nTURLOUGH: Who’s Findecker?\nNYSSA: We can’t help all of them.\nHUSK RAGNAR: No-one survives the experiments. Not for long.\nTURLOUGH: But who did this to you? Where did you come from?\nHUSK RAGNAR: Hell. I came from Hell. The darkest of futures. All of us here on the mountain. But it’1ll be better, now you’re here. (COUGHS)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 19\nNYSSA: You’re from the future?\nNYSSA: NEARBY.\nTURLOUGH: They’re getting closer. Maybe we should move.\nHUSK RAGNAR: No. There’s a tag on my wrist. A beacon.\nTURLOUGH: Is someone coming? Will they rescue us too?\nHUSK RAGNAR: But you never had tags, did you? That’s why you’re important. Nyssa and Turlough. Ugh...\nNYSSA: He’s injured. He needs medication!\nHUSK RAGNAR: (WEAKENING) Tell Sasha, when she gets here...\nTURLOUGH: Sasha?\nHUSK RAGNAR: Tell her you don’t have tags. (WINCES) You don’t even exist.\nTURLOUGH: But we don’t understand. We don’t belong here.\nHUSK RAGNAR: No-one knows you. That’s good. Sasha will understand. You’re so brave, Nyssa. Magnus Greel...\nNYSSA: Magnus who?\nHUSK RAGNAR: Uh... (FADING) I wanted to see Sasha one last time. Before she dies, too. But she was always hopeless at hitting deadlines...\nHUSK RAGNAR: FALLING.\nTURLOUGH: He’s gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 20\nNYSSA: We didn’t even know his name.\nTURLOUGH: Someone’s coming. Get down!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. EXT. WASTELAND (FUTURE BRISBANE)\nTEGAN: (STEPPING OUT) Not a lot here, is there? Unless you like ruins.\nDOCTOR: The source of the Zygma energy must be over the next ridge.\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING) It’s too creepy — (SLIPS IN MUD) Aah!\nDOCTOR: (HELPING HER UP) Careful.\nTEGAN: Flaming mud! Why isn’t the fifty-first century all space cities and monorails?\nDOCTOR: That would have been the thirty-first. Things moved on.\nTEGAN: Mainly backwards.\nDOCTOR: That’s truer than you think. It’s another Ice Age.\nTEGAN: Is it? It’s not snowing here.\nDOCTOR: Maybe not. But the snowfields cover all of Europe and North America, and reach up as far as Tasmania in the south.\nTEGAN: That’s not a lot of room left.\nDOCTOR: There’s been a mass exodus to the colonies. Earth’s been gutted of its resources anyway. It’s just a factory now, processing material from elsewhere.\nTEGAN: You know what’s going on, don’t you? You’re just not telling, as usual. Where is this, exactly?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR: Tricky bit here. Take my hand.\nTEGAN: Got it. Thanks.\nDOCTOR: No, I just don’t like Zygma energy.\nTEGAN: Did that cause all this?\nDOCTOR: It’s not easy to explain.\nTEGAN: Nyssa would tell me.. if she was here.\nDOCTOR: (SIGHING) The Zygma beam is the product of a crude exercise in time travel experimentation, for which this century is justly notorious. Nearly at the top.\nTEGAN: Did you do “future” lessons at school too? As well as history?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you wouldn’t believe.\nDOCTOR: Here we are. That’s better. You can see the river.\nTEGAN: But what a wreck. What happened to the city? Was there a war?\nDOCTOR: I told you. This century is turbulent.\nTEGAN: Hang on. I know this place. The shape of the land... it’s familiar. Down there. That wrecked building... That’s the old Windmill!\nDOCTOR: Tegan...\nTEGAN: We’re on Spring Hill. These ruins... this was Brisbane!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. EXT.

I’ve got thermal blankets.\nTURLOUGH: Thank you.\nSASHA: cc? It’s Sasha. It’s like a massacre, but I’ve got two survivors.\nSASHA: Sasha Dialfa, Earth Free Media. Are you hurt? Can you tell me where you came from? Look, I’d like to interview you.\nNYSSA: You’re Sasha?\nTURLOUGH: There’s someone here who told us to expect you.\nSASHA: Me?\nNYSSA: He’s here. I’m sorry.\nTURLOUGH: We tried to help him, but...\nSASHA: I’m sorry, I don’t - (STUNNED) Oh, my — Ragnar! His face. He’s so old. What happened?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: WHOOSHING DOWN THROUGHOUT THE SCENE.\nNYSSA: He said he came from the future.\nTURLOUGH: Three years in the future.\nSASHA: He did it. He proved it. The idiot killed himself to prove it!\nNYSSA: I’m sorry.\nSASHA: (CRYING) The victims are coming from the future. Oh, heavens.\nSASHA: CC? I’ve got Ragnar here. He’s dead.\nTURLOUGH: He said you’d help us.\nNYSSA: Turlough...\nSASHA: Yes. (COMPOSING HERSELF) Yes, I’m sorry. You fell through too? Out of the sky?\nTURLOUGH: No. We don’t know who these people are.\nSASHA: They started appearing weeks ago. Thousands of bodies. The whole mountain’s knee deep. You’re lucky it’s been snowing.\nNYSSA: But we’re lost too. Your friend said we should tell you.\nSASHA: Ragnar? What did he say?\nNYSSA: That we had no “tags.”\nSASHA: (AMAZED) No tags?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 26\nTURLOUGH: He said we don’t exist. That you’d understand.\nNYSSA: He seemed to think we were important.\nSASHA: No tags.\nSASHA: CC? I’m bringing in a couple of unknowns. Run a check, will\nSASHA: you? (TO NYSSA & TURLOUGH) Sorry.

How many people died?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nTEGAN: You always know. You always know the horrible things!\nDOCTOR: I try to put them right.\nTEGAN: But it doesn’t stop them from happening, does it?!\nDOCTOR: Sometimes. Sometimes it does. (BEAT) Tegan. Do you want to go back?\nTEGAN: (DETERMINED) No. No, we have to find Nyssa and Turlough. It’s just...\nDOCTOR: I know. You’ve had a terrible shock.\nTEGAN: Please. Take your readings.

Did you get that? Activity detected in the Brisbane Dead Zone!\nSASHA: We need to talk.\nRAGNAR: It’s started. Three years we’ve waited for this. The Doctor arrives at last!\nSASHA: Look... this story. I want you to stand down.\nRAGNAR: (AMUSED) Me? You’re joking. This is it.. the home run!\nSASHA: For your own sake.\nRAGNAR: (ANNOYED) Scared I’1l get myself killed? I’m not a ten-year- old. What really happened, when you first met Nyssa?\nSASHA: This isn’t the time.\nRAGNAR: You always clam up. You’1l have to tell me one day.\nSASHA: I can’t explain. Please, Ragnar! Just stand down.\nRAGNAR: This is it, then. We’re going in. Both of us.\nSASHA: (DEFEATED) Ragnar, please... be careful.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: EXT. WASTELAND (FUTURE BRISBANE)\nTEGAN: (STOPS WALKING) What was that? Doctor? Don’t say there’s wild animals here.\nDOCTOR: Nothing dangerous, I’m sure.\nTEGAN: Then what’s that? It’s coming from [over there]\nDOCTOR: (PULLING HER ASIDE) Get down.\nTEGAN: (MUTTER) What is it?\nDOCTOR: Like some sort of troll. Do you have those in Australia?\nTEGAN: More like a gigantic baby. And no we do not!\nDOCTOR: Then it’s a mutation.\nTEGAN: That big? A mutation of what?\nDOCTOR: Not all mutants are deleterious.\nDOCTOR: However...\nTEGAN: It’s seen us!\nDOCTOR: Its features are twisted; the sort of protein distortion caused by Zygma radiation. We’1ll need a branch to fend it off.\nTEGAN: A small tree wouldn’t hold that thing back. Come on! Please!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: Where did I put those keys? (SLAPPING POCKETS) Must be somewhere. Ah...\nTEGAN: Doctor, no!\nDOCTOR: Here. Over here. See these?\nDOCTOR: Like them? Yes? I thought you would.\nTEGAN: Those aren’t the TARDIS keys?\nDOCTOR: Just uncut spares. (TO TROLL) Yes, pretty, aren’t they?\nTEGAN: So now what?\nDOCTOR: He’s probably in pain. I need to examine him.\nTEGAN: Look out!\nDOCTOR: Ah... Dropped them.\nTEGAN: Here. I’ve got them.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, get back!\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: AND BACKS OFF.\nSASHA: (OFF) Secure the circle! See it off!\nDOCTOR: The mutant’s retreating. Tegan? Are you alright?\nTEGAN: How do you think I am? (BEAT) Who are this lot?\nDOCTOR: Security forces, by the look of them. I’1l handle it.\nSASHA: (APPROACHING) Doctor? Tegan? Sasha Dialfa, Earth Free Media.\nDOCTOR: The Press?\nTEGAN: You know us?\nSASHA: We have to get you out of here now. Ragnar?\nRAGNAR: Please put these wristbands on.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Stay by me, Tegan.\nSASHA: You’re coming with us!\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you for your offer, but that sort of bossy behaviour only makes me dig my heels in.\nSASHA: This area isn’t safe.\nDOCTOR: Really. That mutant creature we saw — it used to be human, didn? = at?\nTEGAN: Human? !\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: Its accelerated growth caused by Zygma radiation, yes? (DARKLY) And Weng-Chiang was the God of Abundance.\nTEGAN: Weng-who?\nSASHA: There’s a base beneath us. An experimental camp. But it’s shielded and we can’t infiltrate it.\nDOCTOR: Has the Supreme Alliance of Eastern States declared war on the Icelanders yet? And Magnus Greel, my old “friend” Magnus, is he still Minister of Justice?\nSASHA: We have to get you out. Before the patrols find us.\nTEGAN: We’re looking for our friends.\nRAGNAR: Nyssa and Turlough. Yes?\nDOCTOR: Where are they?\nRAGNAR: Sasha! The dogs are out!\nSASHA: Put the bands on now! We’re leaving!\nDOCTOR: Not until we find our friends!\nSASHA: I said —\nRAGNAR: They’re here!\nTEGAN: Oh my — dingoes! Men like dingoes! Doctor, get back!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: Curious. You’re quite right, Tegan, they do appear to be some sort of hybrid — (BITTEN BY DINGO SOLDIER) Aaah!\nTEGAN: Doctor! (STRUGGLING WITH RAGNAR) They’ve got him! Let me help him —\nRAGNAR: Put the band on.\nTEGAN: Help him! Please!\nTEGAN: You moron, you hit the Doctor!\nSASHA: Too late, they’ve got him! Withdraw! Pull back! Home!\nTEGAN: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. SPACE STATION\nTEGAN: Ugh! (PANIC) Where am I? What did you just do?!\nSASHA: What a mess!\nTEGAN: I just blinked, and I was here.\nRAGNAR: It’s okay. The trans always disorients people the first time.\nTEGAN: Those dingo-soldiers took the Doctor. Take us back. We have to find him!\nSASHA: Give her something to calm her down, Ragnar. I’ve a report to file.\nRAGNAR: You’re safe here. We’ll get the Doctor back, I promise.\nTEGAN: You’d better. Where is this?\nRAGNAR: Earth Media Monitoring Station. We call it the Correspondents’ Club.\nTEGAN: Where’s the way out?\nRAGNAR: There’s no way out. We’re in space, Tegan. In cloaked orbit two-fifty klicks above the Earth.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. FINDECKER’S LAB\nDOCTOR: (GROANS, COMING TO) Ohh, my shoulder.\nCHOPS: Hit by your own troopers. We just fetched you in.\nDOCTOR: Into where exactly?\nCHOPS: Hurr.. The Chief’s after you. He hates bushwalkers on his patch... Strings ‘em up insides-out.\nDOCTOR: Tell him I’1ll be delighted to speak to him... once you’ve untied me.\nCHOPS: WHINES NERVOUSLY.\nDOCTOR: This is him, I take it? The Chief?\nCHOPS: We brought him, Chief. Only a bit damaged.\nFINDECKER: If you’ve finished, Sergeant Chops, get out.\nFINDECKER: You'd better be co-operative, or I'll just give you a number and be done with you. Where are you damaged?\nDOCTOR: My shoulder. It’s what’s termed friendly fire. I’m the Doctor, by the way.\nFINDECKER: Let me see.\nDOCTOR: Ow!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 37\nFINDECKER: A glancing burn. It will soon heal.\nDOCTOR: And you are.. no, let me guess. You must be... Findecker! Yes? Quantum physicist, cyborg engineer extraordinaire...\nFINDECKER: Sa Yy Findecker, Honorary Alumnus, Plaava Institute.\nDOCTOR: And the discoverer of the double nexus particle. Your “magnificent” achievements echo throughout history. What on Earth are you doing here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. SPACE STATION\nRAGNAR: Tegan, Sasha’s in editorial. She’ll let us know as soon as there’s [news] — What’re you doing, staring out of the window?\nTEGAN: Just looking out at the Earth. I thought the snow would be white, but it’s grey. It covers half the planet.\nRAGNAR: I thought you’d have retuned the glass. Here, let me —\nRAGNAR: (TO GLASS) Show spyfeed.\nRAGNAR: APPLAUSE FROM SPACEDROME CROWD [ITALICISED SECTIONS EXTRACTED FROM NEXT SCENE]\nTEGAN: Hey, that’s TV!\nRAGNAR: Intelligent glass. You use your finger to flick through.\nTEGAN: So what’s this we’re watching?\nRAGNAR: Direct video feed from Peking.\nTEGAN: And this is worth spying on, why?\nRAGNAR: The Icelandic Alliance has sent a delegation — that’s them arriving — to establish a new Trade Accord with the self-styled Supreme Alliance of Eastern States.\nINGRID: (ON MIC) Thank you, High Minister, for your warm welcome — in\nINGRID: every way! [On behalf of the Icelandic Alliance, I want to say how good it is to be here in Peking. We hope for great things. Two Alliances in One Accord. The re-forging of Earth! ]\nINGRID: [FX: APPLAUSE. ]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 39\nTEGAN: Who’s she?\nRAGNAR: Ingrid Bjarnsdottir, the Icelandic Commissioner.\nTEGAN: Very teutonic. And the guy she’s meeting?\nRAGNAR: That’s Magnus Greel, Justice Minister of the Supreme Alliance.\nMAGNUS GREEL: (ON MIC) Thank you, Commissioner. [The big speeches will come later, but one thing I know. There is a unity coming. One Earth at the heart of the Empire. Great things for a great day! ]\nMAGNUS GREEL: [FX: RIOTOUS APPLAUSE, TO FIT UNDER... ]\nTEGAN: Oh, right. The Doctor mentioned him. He’s handsome enough.\nRAGNAR: Everything he touches stinks. He has dodgy funding links to several off-Earth science faculties. His opponents have a habit of disappearing. He’s got more blood on his hands than a butcher’s boy.\nTEGAN: Not a fan then?\nRAGNAR: Look at him. Smug and self-satisfied, lapping up the applause. He’s a monster.\nTEGAN: Wait a minute. The woman beside him, that looks like —\nMAGNUS GREEL: (ON MIC) [Thank you. Thank you. But] none of this could have been achieved without the support of my office and, of course, my devoted bride-to-be. [Please, my dear, step forward —]\nTEGAN: No.. no, it can’t be...!\nRAGNAR: You recognise her?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 40\nTEGAN: That’s my best friend. The one who’s missing. That’s — that’s [Nyssa! ]\nMAGNUS GREEL: (ON MIC) [Step forward..] Nyssa!\nMAGNUS GREEL: [FX: APPLAUSE]\nMAGNUS GREEL: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 41"

Somehow you know my work. Even covet it, yes?\nDOCTOR: Well...\nFINDECKER: And I rarely converse with anyone remotely approaching my level of enquiring intelligence.\nDOCTOR: I know the feeling.\nFINDECKER: Alright. I’11 show you round, Doctor whoever-you-are...\nDOCTOR: Well, thank you.\nFINDECKER: But one illicit move and my guards will use all of their canine zeal to tear you into edible gobbets.\nDOCTOR: Understood. Magnus Greel is lucky to have so illustrious a scientist in his service.\nFINDECKER: I’m no lackey of Greel’s.\nDOCTOR: Of course not.\nFINDECKER: The man is a scientific ruffian.\nDOCTOR: But he has power.\nFINDECKER: Oh, he will have. But he’ll pay through the nose before I give it to him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: INT. GREEL’S SALOON (IN MOTION)\nGREEL: So how was I?\nNYSSA: (AMUSED) Very statesman-like.\nGREEL: Oh? Not presidential?\nNYSSA: You're not even Commissioner yet. Besides, Presidents don’t devour their brides-to-be in public.\nGREEL: No? I thought Presidents did what they liked.\nNYSSA: No.\nGREEL: How disappointing. I’d better resign and get a job on a guano dredger sifting the rings of Saturn. No-one knows or even cares what they get up to. (BEAT) Poor Nyssa. Will you miss me?\nNYSSA: Perhaps. But the Icelandic Commissioner did not look amused.\nGREEL: It’s all that snow where she comes from. Brrrrr. No fire in the blood.\nGREEL: Two hours at home and then off to the boring banquet.\nNYSSA: Kaori will have laid out our clothes. She’s a wonderful present, Magnus. I love her head made of flowers. Thank you.\nGREEL: If it gives you more time for your projects.\nNYSSA: It does. And I’d.. well, I’d wondered [if...]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 47\nGREEL: Yes?\nNYSSA: I’d like to see more of the factories.\nGREEL: Earth has precious little else to offer.\nNYSSA: Perhaps I could make some visits? In an official capacity, of course.\nGREEL: Let me guess. You know more about the technology than I do.\nNYSSA: Actually I meant to see the workers’ conditions.\nGREEL: Ah...\nNYSSA: I hear stories about low credit and twenty-five hour work shifts. And poor health too.\nGREEL: That’s my little ex-medic speaking.\nNYSSA: I hope so. I’d feel involved, Magnus.\nGREEL: Well... alright, I’1l sound out the Ministry. Just don’t interfere too much. (BEAT) Nearly home.\nNYSSA: And also...\nGREEL: Yes.\nNYSSA: I was checking through your finances... and I found some unexplained anomalies.\nGREEL: (TESTY) Nyssa...\nNYSSA: Payments to an anonymous off-Earth account. Large amounts. Several million credits each time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 48\nGREEL: (LAUGHING) Maybe you’re not supposed to know.\nNYSSA: But I was concerned.\nGREEL: Oh, Nyssa. You found me out. (SIGH) Alright. If you must know. (LYING) It’s a trust I set up for us.\nNYSSA: For us?\nGREEL: For our future children... once we’re married.\nNYSSA: (AWKWARD) Ah...\nGREEL: But it’s a secret. So don’t tell them yet.\nNYSSA: Right.\nGREEL: You know, perhaps it’s time we did something about [that.]\nGREEL: Nyssa!\nGREEL: WAIL.\nGREEL: Get help, driver! Get help!

All you people do is question me.\nSASHA: “Interview” you.\nTEGAN: It feels like harassment.\nRAGNAR: Then suppose you try giving straight answers, Tegan.\nTEGAN: No. You tell me for a change!\nSASHA: (BEAT) Go on then.\nTEGAN: When you found the Doctor and me, you knew who we were.\nSASHA: We'd been expecting you for three years.\nTEGAN: Three!\nRAGNAR: Ever since Nyssa and Vislor Turlough arrived on Earth.\nTEGAN: That long ago! Were they hurt?\nRAGNAR: I was still a cub reporter. Sasha brought them in. Full interviews. Exclusives.\nSASHA: They were in shock. But they were adamant you’d come back for them one day.\nTEGAN: They’ve been waiting for us? For three years?\nSASHA: They said the Doctor’s ship smashed into a time displacement beam...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 50\nRAGNAR: Someone was working on time travel experiments, flinging victims back in time.\nSASHA: Thousands of bodies strewn across a mountain in snowy Bhutan. It was a massacre. But we were seeing the effect before the cause.\nRAGNAR: The morgue before the murder.\nSASHA: Oh, shut up.\nRAGNAR: It’s true. It took years tracing the beam back to the Dead zone.\nTEGAN: Brisbane... that was my home once.\nSASHA: There’d been an energy spill, years back. The area was off limits.\nRAGNAR: The perfect spot to build a hidden base.\nSASHA: How “convenient.”\nTEGAN: And Nyssa and Turlough?\nRAGNAR: When you traced that beam, you landed at the wrong end.\nTEGAN: Oh, great.\nRAGNAR: Sasha found your friends stranded three years earlier at the target point, among the sea of corpses.\nSASHA: No ID. No credit. After the interviews, Editorial must have found placements for them.\nTEGAN: In Peking?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page\nRAGNAR: Peking? Reykjavik?\nSASHA: I don’t know. We don’t get told.\nRAGNAR: Nyssa’s done well enough for herself.\nTEGAN: And you’ve broadcast all this?\nRAGNAR: Not yet... It’s still on file.\nSASHA: 51\nSASHA: The fact is.. we can’t go public. Not till we open up that base\nSASHA: and expose who’s behind it all.\nTEGAN: But the Doctor’s already in there. Isn’t that enough proof?\nSASHA: I’ve filed a request with Editorial. Once they’ve stamped it,\nSASHA: in we go to find him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: INT. FINDECKER’S BASE — CORRIDOR\nFINDECKER: (WALKING INTO CORRIDOR) Chops! Stop dawdling. Bring our guest.\nCHOPS: Move on.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, Chops. (FX: THEY WALK) This base of yours really is bigger than it looks, Findecker.\nFINDECKER: We have three kilometres of cold storage areas.\nDOCTOR: Looks more like an abattoir. But the carcass racks are empty.\nFINDECKER: Oh, I never work on carcasses. Living tissue yields far better results. Regrettably, it has a much shorter shelf life.\nDOCTOR: Live humans die so easily, don’t they? Especially when exposed to high doses of Zygma radiation. That must be such a nuisance.\nFINDECKER: Fortunately Earth’s colonies are rich in supplies. I get regular deliveries.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, but isn’t experimenting in time travel like shooting arrows at the sky? You never get them back, or see the results.\nFINDECKER: My subjects are projected into the past. That way the results are easily retrievable.\nDOCTOR: And what’s the survival rate? Not many, so I heard.\nFINDECKER: Chops! Bring him through.\nCHOPS: (TO DOCTOR) You. Onto balcony.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25. EXT. FINDECKER’S BASE — BALCONY [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: What’s this?\nFINDECKER: A daily task. Chops! It’s feeding time.\nFINDECKER: APPROACHING FROM BELOW.\nDOCTOR: Ah... that’1l be another of your experiments. Your pet troll? I think I met him earlier.\nFINDECKER: He’s more of a genetic side effect. Zygma radiation stimulated his growth hormone out of all expected proportion.\nDOCTOR: He grew and grew. And now he’s the biggest toddler in town.\nFINDECKER: He makes a good guard dog. And he’s delightfully aggressive when provoked. Chops? Attach the Doctor to the rail.\nCHOPS: Hands together.\nDOCTOR: Ow! This really isn’t necessary, you know —\nFINDECKER: Dangle him over the side, Chops. Let’s see how our giant little one responds to the stimulation of a new toy.\nDOCTOR: And I thought we were getting on so well — (SHOVED OVER RAILING) — aaah!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT.

Someone tried to kill him.\nTEGAN: Magnus Greel? Was he hurt?\nRAGNAR: Greel’s fine. But your friend was with him.\nTEGAN: Nyssa?\nSASHA: That’s right. Looks like she took the shot.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: EXT. FINDECKER’S BASE — BALCONY\nDOCTOR WHO: A CREAKING CHAIN.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) You’re throwing away an opportunity, Findecker.\nFINDECKER: I do not taking kindly to being ridiculed, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Then stop sulking and face the truth. Your time travel experiments are doomed.\nFINDECKER: (MUTTERS, RE TROLL) Where’s he going now?\nFINDECKER: (CALLING) Come along, you overgrown foetus. Dinner’s waiting.\nDOCTOR: The double nexus particle is a liar. It’ll trick you at every turn.\nFINDECKER: Mock all you like. When its thread is harnessed, it will take us anywhere in space and time.\nDOCTOR: Bunkum. It’s a viral mirage. It’s leading your research up a dark alley and you’1ll be stuck there forever.\nFINDECKER: Prove it. Give me one shred of evidence.\nDOCTOR: You’re dying.\nFINDECKER: (HALF LAUGHING) Ah... I hardly think...\nDOCTOR: You've been poisoned by exposure to your own experiments. The Zygma radiation is eating you away.\nFINDECKER: Laughable nonsense!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: It’s true and you know it!\nFINDECKER: At last. Here he comes.\nFINDECKER: (CALLING) Dinner time, my pet! A fresh morsel for you!\nDOCTOR: What does he usually get? Your leftovers? (BATTED HARD BY TROLL) Aah!\nFINDECKER: He will insist on playing with his food.\nDOCTOR: Leftovers like the living bodies you distil — ouch! - and ingest as medicine to drag your own miserable life out?!\nFINDECKER: Who told you that?\nDOCTOR: It’s common knowledge, Findecker — (BATTED AGAIN) Ooof!\nDOCTOR: SWINGING.\nDOCTOR: (BATTED ABOUT) You’re part of history, Findecker! — Ow, don’t do that! - Of course, time travel’s possible. I’ve been doing it myself for centuries. — Ow! - But not your way! Aaahagh!

You’ve had a nasty shock.\nNYSSA: I’ve had far worse. And we must go. It’s important to show a brave face.\nGREEL: Oh, Nyssa.

I ordered security to be doubled!\nTURLOUGH: It’s been more than doubled, sir. But... whilst your safety is obviously my first concern, I am Miss Traken’s secretary. It isn’t my area.\nGREEL: I could have been killed!\nTURLOUGH: Yes, sir. I am very sorry. I’m sure Security are reviewing every possibility. It won’t happen again.\nDUPLESSIS: (DISTANT) Greel!\nGREEL: It had better not.\nTURLOUGH: Minister.\nGREEL: (CALLING) Commissioner DuPlessis.

Trouble’s your business. What about Nyssa?\nSASHA: Only slightly hurt... apparently.\nTEGAN: Well, thank goodness for that. But we can’t leave the Doctor.\nSASHA: The story’s on hold.\nTEGAN: But I’m not. Give me one of those wristbands.

You’re not really going to hang me up like a side of beef, are you?\nDOCTOR: Think, Chops. It’s freezing in here — I'll be lucky to last an hour without developing hypothermia, and then what use will I be to anyone?\nCHOPS: Shut your maw.\nDOCTOR: Can’t be easy to think, I suppose, what with your poor old brain stuck in a fibro-construct body. Being held together by magnets can’t feel right.\nCHOPS: It feels strong.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but didn’t you used to be a dingo? I bet that was fun. Running wild. You and your mates. Chasing rabbits and kangaroos. Are there still kangaroos?\nCHOPS: No boomers round here.\nDOCTOR: No? The Dead Zone, I suppose. How many mates do you have?\nCHOPS: Bluey and Ripper and Drongo and Muddy...\nDOCTOR: Right.\nCHOPS: . and Stubby and Kylie...\nDOCTOR: Yes...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 63\nCHOPS: . and Ocker and...\nDOCTOR: Yes... yes, quite a little army obviously.\nCHOPS: Greel.

Nothing must topple the Accord summit.\nGREEL: It came close to being toppled today.\nDUPLESSIS: No, no. The entire Icelandic delegation was quick to express their good will and condemnation.\nGREEL: They’ve already sent their “heartfelt” sympathy.\nDUPLESSIS: Magnus, the crackpot would-be assassins will be caught. I know you have ambitions, but don’t get angry.\nGREEL: I believe in a united Earth. But not as a republic.\nDUPLESSIS: (WARNING) But an individual display of power would be against the spirit of the Accord. And also illegal.\nGREEL: I would remind you, Commissioner, that I embody justice and the law. Even with the Accord signed, the Supreme Alliance must be shown to be superior.\nDUPLESSIS: I’ve not forgotten what you promised us. The prize of time travel. How soon now?\nGREEL: It will be there. Soon we shall put the black hole that is Earth back in its rightful place at the very heart of the Empire.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT.

Who do you work for?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 67\nKAORI: For you, Madam.\nNYSSA: The first thing I did was give Kaori’s system a thorough overhaul and adjustment.\nTURLOUGH: So was she spying on you?\nNYSSA: Difficult to say. But she works for me now. And she’s very useful.\nKAORI: Thank you, Madam.\nTURLOUGH: I still hate being watched.\nNYSSA: That’s just you. Don’t forget they chose us for this mission because no-one knew who we were.\nTURLOUGH: I quite liked not existing.\nNYSSA: We can’t just throw away three years’ work.\nTURLOUGH: But there’s still no evidence. Greel’s too clever. We can’t prove he’s importing anything illegal to Earth.\nNYSSA: Can’t we? Kaori found these.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nNYSSA: Kaori?\nKAORI: Payments from the account of “Chervil Dun-tsu” to an unnamed off-Earth source.\nTURLOUGH: But how?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 68\nNYSSA: Chervil is an operative in Magnus’s office.

Sasha’s account of bodies dumped on a mountainside in Bhutan.\nTEGAN: When she first met Nyssa and Turlough!\nDOCTOR: All it tells us is that “Two unknowns were picked up.”\nTEGAN: That’s all?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and the visuals are restricted access.\nTEGAN: Maybe they’re being sensitive.\nDOCTOR: Yes... I wonder...\nDOCTOR: FURIOUSLY AT IT. DOOR OPENS.\nTEGAN: Oh look, another insomniac. What’s up, Ragnar?\nRAGNAR: Editorial are not happy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 97\nTEGAN: Surely they can run an exposé on Greel by now.\nRAGNAR: They want an exclusive on the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I don’t do interviews. (SEES SOMETHING WORRYING) Ah...\nTEGAN: Find something?\nDOCTOR: (COVERING UP) Erm, no. No, not exactly.\nRAGNAR: Let’s see.\nDOCTOR: Oops. Oh, sorry. Lost it.. Never mind, eh? It wasn’t important.\nRAGNAR: (SUSPICIOUS) Right...\nTEGAN: Why can’t Greel be arrested and tried as a war criminal?\nRAGNAR: There isn’t a war.\nDOCTOR: Not yet. But there soon will be.\nRAGNAR: You think that’1l happen?\nDOCTOR: Maybe. But Greel won’t be involved. He dies elsewhere. Not in this time.\nTEGAN: Oh, here we go. This, Ragnar, is the most complicated man in the Universe.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nTEGAN: You know what’1ll happen, don’t you? Were you there?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: No comment. I can try to minimise the damage, but I can’t stop Greel himself.\nTEGAN: (PORTENTOUS) Not without messing up the fabric of time?\nDOCTOR: It’s very delicate.\nRAGNAR: So where does Greel die? And will it be horrible?\nDOCTOR: (GRAVE) Ragnar... No-one should ever know that.\nTEGAN: We could still pull Nyssa and Turlough out of Peking and leave.\nDOCTOR: Without my TARDIS?\nRAGNAR: Want to go down there?\nDOCTOR: I thought you’d never ask.\nRAGNAR: Right. It’s off your own back. It’1ll be news to me. I can’t think how you got hold of the wristband.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I’1ll take Chops too. He needs a walk.\nRAGNAR: (LEAVING) Right.\nTEGAN: Ready when you are.\nDOCTOR: Erm, no Tegan.\nTEGAN: Stay here? Oh, now come on.\nDOCTOR: (CONFIDENTIAL) We won’t be long. Keep an eye on our friend Ragnar. And don’t let him do anything foolish.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. GREEL’S HOUSE — RECEPTION\nTURLOUGH: So who was this mystery intruder?\nNYSSA: He said his name was Findecker, and that he works for my — (CATCHES HERSELF) — for Greel.\nTURLOUGH: And he knows about us?\nNYSSA: He knows everything. He was sitting there by the fire, Turlough. It was frightening.\nTURLOUGH: But has he told Greel?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. You didn’t see Magnus at the banquet. He went crazy. All because of that explosion. I never saw that coming. Not like that. He’s seriously disturbed.\nTURLOUGH: We should have got out of here long ago.\nNYSSA: But suppose Findecker is somehow causing it. Did you meet your contact?\nTURLOUGH: He didn’t show.\nNYSSA: He didn’t...?\nTURLOUGH: There are new guards on the streets - all over town. So I went to the Embassy. I nearly got caught myself.\nNYSSA: You saw Mrs Bjarnsdottir?\nTURLOUGH: Briefly. She’s trapped as well. Those guards... They’re Greel’s private army. That’s what he’s investing in. He’s going to seize control. Nyssa.. she wants us to stay.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 100\nNYSSA: To stay? Suppose I speak to Commissioner DuPlessis? Tell him everything. He could stop this.\nGREEL: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (STARTLED) Oh! Magnus.\nTURLOUGH: Good morning, Minister.\nNYSSA: How did you sleep?\nGREEL: (TO NYSSA) I don’t want him here anymore.\nNYSSA: Magnus?\nGREEL: I want him out!\nNYSSA: Turlough is my private secretary.\nGREEL: Is that all he is?\nNYSSA: Magnus, that’s ridiculous.\nTURLOUGH: Minister, I have every respect for your fiancée.\nGREEL: Particularly behind my back!\nGREEL: Get out!\nNYSSA: No, Magnus!\nGREEL: Out!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 101\nTURLOUGH: (LEAVING) Sorry, Nyssa.\nGREEL: Miss Traken to you! Soon to be Mrs Greel!\nNYSSA: Magnus...\nGREEL: (WEEPING) It’s all gone away.\nNYSSA: Come on. Let’s get you some help. It’1ll be alright.\nGREEL: No. Just you, Nyssa. You’re all I need to see. Just you...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: EXT. PEKING MARKET\nDOCTOR WHO: TELEPORT AS BEFORE.\nDOCTOR: Here we are. How’s your sense of direction, Chopsy? Last time I was here, it was still Beijing.\nCHOPS: (SNIFFS) Too many niffs in the air.\nDOCTOR: No, maybe the market wasn’t the best place to land.\nCHOPS: Hang on. (DEEP BREATH)\nDOCTOR: What now?\nCHOPS: Mark outs. (SNIFFING ROUND) Jumbuck... and Duster... and Jaywick...\nDOCTOR: Friends of yours? Marking their territory?\nCHOPS: But they’re for Greel. Not my new Chief.\nDOCTOR: Stay upwind if you can. Come on.\nCHOPS: Ah...\nDOCTOR: Something else?\nCHOPS: Not good. Know that niff. It’s Him. The old Chief.\nDOCTOR: Findecker?\nCHOPS: Stay close. We’ll soon track him down.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. SPACE STATION\nRAGNAR: (IN SHOCK) I don’t believe this.\nTEGAN: Ragnar?\nRAGNAR: I checked back over what the Doctor was viewing. I knew he was hiding something.\nTEGAN: That’s Nyssa and Turlough!\nSASHA: Are you hurt? Can you tell me where you came from? Look, I’d like to interview you.\nRAGNAR: It’s Sasha’s last report. The restricted video. He got into it.\nNYSSA: You’re Sasha?\nTURLOUGH: There’s someone here who told us to expect you.\nTEGAN: The Doctor sees that sort of thing as a challenge. Oh... they look so cold. Is this through Sasha’s eyes?\nSASHA: Me?\nNYSSA: He’s here. I’m sorry.\nRAGNAR: POV Cams. Standard fitting.\nTURLOUGH: We tried to help him, but...\nRAGNAR: I can’t watch this.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: (STUNNED) Ragnar! Oh, my — His face. He’s so old. What\nDOCTOR WHO: happened?\nTEGAN: Ragnar?\nRAGNAR: It’s me, but I wasn’t there. How was I there?\nNYSSA: He said he came from the future.\nTURLOUGH: Three years in the future.\nTEGAN: Turn it off, Ragnar.\nSASHA: He did it. He proved it. The idiot killed himself to prove it!\nNYSSA: I’m sorry.\nSASHA: (CRYING) The victims are coming from the future. Oh, [heavens-]\nTEGAN: That’s enough.\nRAGNAR: I looked so old. Like I was my granddad.\nTEGAN: It doesn’t have to be that way.\nRAGNAR: It hasn’t happened yet... but it will. I’m gonna be thrown back in time - back to then. And Editorial knew. That’s why they covered it up! The morgue before the murder - that’s what I said. And Sasha was there. She knew, and didn’t tell me! That must have broken her.\nTEGAN: No. Things can be changed.\nRAGNAR: Oh, yeah? Is that what your precious Doctor says? (GETTING UP) No, I’m TRANSing down now!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 105\nTEGAN: It could be years yet, Ragnar. You’re not thinking straight. Just wait!\nRAGNAR: Wait? How much time have I got? I can’t wait!\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING) Then I’m coming with you. We’1ll find the Doctor together!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: NYSSA’S ANSAFONE\nNYSSA: Hello. I’m not here at the moment. Please leave a message.\nTURLOUGH: (EXCITED BUT HAVING TO SPEAK FURTIVELY) Nyssa? It’s me. Nyssa, call me when you can. I’m in the outer office. I’ve just seen the TARDIS being wheeled in. Here, in the Ministry!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: EXT. PEKING STREET\nDOCTOR WHO: APPEAR.\nTEGAN: Woah. This is Peking, right?\nRAGNAR: (CALMER, GRIMLY RESOLVED) That’s the Justice Ministry through the Pagoda Gate.\nTEGAN: (SETTING OFF) Come on, Ragnar. We have to find the Doctor.\nRAGNAR: No, Tegan. That’s your story. I have nothing to lose. I’ve just seen my own death.\nTEGAN: But you might walk straight into it. Ever heard of a self- fulfilling prophecy?\nRAGNAR: The sooner, the better.\nTEGAN: No! Look, when they found you on the mountain, you looked old.\nRAGNAR: All the bodies were old. It’s the time travel process. The radiation. But when I find Findecker and Greel...\nTEGAN: But what if we can break the circle? Think, Ragnar. If you won’t do it for yourself, then do it for Sasha.\nRAGNAR: The war sirens. It’s starting. Good luck, Tegan. Find the Doctor and get out while you can.\nTEGAN: Ragnar! Wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. JUSTICE MINISTRY — GREEL’S OFFICE\nGREEL: (AT DESK, LOOKING UP) I said, I was not to be dist-[urbed] (BREAKS OFF) Findecker?!?\nFINDECKER: You are surprised to see me in the Ministry?\nGREEL: I’m surprised to see you at all! I thought... with the explosion...\nFINDECKER: Yes, well — despite the efforts of some depressingly manic Time Agent, normal service, as they say, has been resumed.\nGREEL: Time Agent-?\nFINDECKER: Last night, plenty was lost. But more was gained. I bring you a gift, Greel. A trophy. (CLAPS HANDS, CALLING OFF) Workborgs! Bring in the box!\nGREEL: Trophy? What sort of trophy is this?\nFINDECKER: (TO ROBOTS) There, in the corner. (FX: ROBOTS PLACE THE TARDIS AND DEPART, THROUGH:) This, Greel, is the aforesaid Time Agent’s craft.\nGREEL: (READING) “Police... Box.”\nFINDECKER: Yes. It seems we are scrutinised by hitherto unknown authorities. We must be alert.\nGREEL: You mean, there could be more of these ‘Time Agents’?.\nFINDECKER: If one is here, more may follow. And you, Greel?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 109\nGREEL: Me? I am summoned to the Commissioner’s office. But the old fool can wait. My guards... our guards surround the Icelandic Embassy. I have demands to issue. Cases to review. Sentences to pass. (LAUGHING) Business as usual.\nFINDECKER: And your lovely bride-to-be?\nGREEL: Nyssa? (RELAXES) What would I do without her? She is my salvation.\nFINDECKER: I assumed that was me. Oh dear, Magnus. I fear I must disabuse you of that notion.\nGREEL: Do what? I don’t understand.\nFINDECKER: Kaori!\nKAORI: I am ready, sir.\nFINDECKER: The list of Nyssa’s misdemeanours as you have observed them.\nGREEL: Her what?\nFINDECKER: Please begin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: EXT./INT. JUSTICE MINISTRY\nDOCTOR: (EFFORTFUL) I’ve often wondered, Chops, why it is that windows are never left open on the ground floor? — (SNAGGED) Ow!\nCHOPS: (BELOW) There’s a door down here.\nDOCTOR: What? Ouch!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Turlough! It’s you!\nTURLOUGH: I don’t believe it, after all this [time] — (BREAKS OFF) What are you doing, climbing up the wall of the Justice Ministry?\nDOCTOR: Explanations later, but first — this wisteria isn’t very sturdy, so if you would...?\nTURLOUGH: Here, let me help you.\nDOCTOR: (SLIPPING) Agh!\nTURLOUGH: It’s alright, I’ve got you. Hold on. In you come...\nDOCTOR: (JUMPING DOWN ONTO FLOOR) Oof! Thank you, Turlough. Just a moment. (CALLS DOWN) Chops. Stay out of sight. Be with you in minute.\nCHOPS: (BELOW) Gotcha, Chiefy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 111\nTURLOUGH: So where have you been the last three years?\nDOCTOR: It may not feel like it, Turlough, but we came straight away. What about Nyssa? Is she really engaged to Magnus Greel?\nTURLOUGH: It’s a long story. I’m her secretary. Or was, until this morning.\nDOCTOR: Turlough, Greel is one of the worst maniacs in Earth’s sorry history. I only hope Nyssa knows just what a dangerous game she’s playing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: INT. JUSTICE MINISTRY — GREEL’S OFFICE\nKAORI: [..] May fourth: Nyssa passes restricted data to Mr Turlough, who conveys it to the Icelandic Embassy. May eighth: Mr Turlough supplies Nyssa with data pertaining to the Minister’s private financial investments. May twentieth:\nGREEL: (STUNNED) That’s enough! Findecker, I can hardly believe this!\nFINDECKER: Under your own roof, Greel. Clearly you were too busy to notice.\nGREEL: Kaori! Where is Nyssa? Fetch her now!\nKAORI: Nyssa is no longer in the Ministry.\nGREEL: Then find her! And her “secretary”!\nRAGNAR: Greel! Magnus Greel1!\nGREEL: Who are you? How did you get in here-?\nRAGNAR: Press pass. Down on the floor, you murderer!\nFINDECKER: I know this man.\nRAGNAR: You too, Findecker!\nFINDECKER: This is one of the... ruffians who destroyed my project.\nRAGNAR: On the floor! Or I’11l shoot your alien kneecaps out!\nFINDECKER: (COLD) I will not bow to you. Or your like. Kaori...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 113\nKAORI: The use of a gun in the Ministry is forbidden.\nFINDECKER: Thank you, Kaori.\nGREEL: (FX: FLICKS COMMS) Security! In here now! (FX: DISTANT ALARM SOUNDS )\nFINDECKER: Wait. My old workshop here is still viable. I mean to recommence my research. This one can be my first subject.\nGREEL: Legally sentenced first, Findecker! Let’s do it properly. Star Chamber sits in thirty minutes.\nGREEL: Guards — arrest this man. Charge him with the attempted murder of a government official. Tab scan for record, motives and ID. He is already pronounced guilty.\nRAGNAR: (COMING ROUND) Wh-what...?\nGREEL: Take him down. You others — bring the Time Agent’s craft!\nGREEL: INTO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. JUSTICE MINISTRY — CORRIDOR/CUPBOARD\nDOCTOR: Was it worth it, Turlough? Working for the Icelanders?\nTURLOUGH: (MUTTER) Keep it down, Doctor. Guards everywhere. (FX: OPENING DOOR) In here.\nDOCTOR: A stationery cupboard?!?\nTURLOUGH: (GRABBING DOCTOR) Just get in!\nTURLOUGH: You must realise, Doctor — the Icelanders had to know what Greel was planning.\nDOCTOR: And Nyssa thought it was the right thing to do?\nTURLOUGH: She didn’t mean to land up engaged.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure she didn’t.\nTURLOUGH: But Greel can be charm on a stick when he likes.\nDOCTOR: Not the insane, craven monster he’1l become, then. Where is Nyssa now?\nTURLOUGH: She’s gone.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: Gone to the Commissioner’s office to expose Greel for the villain he is. And get him arrested. (BEAT) Well, we had to do something!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR: But that’s not Greel’s fate. We have to stop [her.]\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) Sh! Someone’s outside. One of Greel’s dingo soldiers.\nCHOPS: (FROM BEHIND DOOR) Chief? You in there?\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, he’s with me. (FX: OPENS DOOR) Chops! You gave us a fright.\nCHOPS: Got tired of waiting. And then...\nTEGAN: . then he picked up a scent he recognised.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Turlough. Oh, it’s great to see you. (HUGS HIM)\nTURLOUGH: (BEING HUGGED) It’s, er, good to see you too.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, I told you to stay put.\nTEGAN: Ragnar found out about Sasha.\nDOCTOR: Ah...\nTEGAN: He totally freaked. I couldn’t stop him. He came down here to sort Greel out.\nDOCTOR: Oh, good grief.\nTURLOUGH: Hang on. Is this Ragnar Crezzen, hothead reporter? Trying to face off Magnus Greel?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 116\nTEGAN: With a gun. We have to stop him. Or he’1l land up dead on a mountain three years ago!\nDOCTOR: Tegan.\nTEGAN: No! Don’t tell me it can’t be changed!\nDOCTOR: I can’t be everywhere. I have to stop Nyssa!\nTEGAN: Nyssa?\nDOCTOR: Her best intentions could throw the whole of Earth’s future history into chaos!\nTEGAN: I don’t believe this. Will you stop holding Time’s hand for just one minute? It’s bigger than you are. It can look after itself. We’re talking about people here with hopes and rights. Maybe, left alone, they can change it for the better by themselves!\nTEGAN: SCENE 60: INT. COURTROOM\nGREEL: Ragnar Crezzen, you are found guilty of the attempted murder of a government official of the Supreme Alliance of Eastern States.\nRAGNAR: (QUIETLY) People have to know.\nSTEWARD: Quiet.\nGREEL: The subversive actions of Earth Free Media have imperilled the security of the Alliance. Such crimes are punishable by termination.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. OUTSIDE COURTROOM\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) People are leaving.\nSTEWARD: (DISTANT) This session of Star Chamber is now closed.\nCHOPS: (HUSHED) Too late.\nTEGAN: (HUSHED) We’ve missed Ragnar?\nTURLOUGH: (HUSHED) He’1ll have been sent down. Sorry, Tegan.\nTEGAN: I’m not giving up yet. Where will they take him?\nSTEWARD: (APPROACHING) Please clear the court.\nTURLOUGH: Excuse me. These people are guests of the Minister.\nSTEWARD: The Minister was leaving. And animals are not allowed.\nCHOPS: Who’s an animal?\nDOCTOR: Oh, how very tiresome. Magnus promised to see us.\nTEGAN: We’ve come all the way from Queensland.\nTURLOUGH: He must have forgotten. But erm.. (FX: RUSTLES MONEY) .. if you let us through we might still catch him.\nSTEWARD: (TAKING MONEY) That will do nicely, Mr Turlough. Third door on the left.\nTURLOUGH: Thanks. Come on, you lot.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 118\nTEGAN: (DEPARTING) How much did you pay him, Turlough?\nDOCTOR: (DEPARTING) The joys of Baksheesh.\nSTEWARD: (CALLING AFTER) Better hurry. The Minister was in a rush.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. COMMISSIONER DUPLESSIS’S OFFICE\nNYSSA: Commissioner DuPlessis?\nDUPLESSIS: (AWKWARD) Nyssa...\nNYSSA: Please excuse this intrusion, but I have to speak with you.\nDUPLESSIS: (PANICKY) My dear, it’s not convenient. —\nNYSSA: It’s about Greel. Commissioner, I have proof that he plans to seize control of the Alliance. He’s working with an alien scientist called Findecker.\nDUPLESSIS: (SADLY) Oh, Nyssa...\nGREEL: (FROM OFF) What did I tell you, Commissioner?\nNYSSA: Magnus! I — I didn’t see you there...\nGREEL: Evidently, or you would not have shown your true colours. (STANDING, STRIDING TOWARDS NYSSA) All the time we’ve been together, you were in the pay of the Icelandic Alliance. Gaining my trust, passing secrets. Living lies! (GROWING MANIC) You affect the air of a self-righteous do-gooder, the perfect Ministerial consort! But you’re a cheat and a liar! (TWISTING NYSSA’S ARM) And we all know what happens to liars, don’t we?\nNYSSA: (SCARED) My arm, Magnus! You’re hurting me...!\nDUPLESSIS: Leave her be, Minister.\nGREEL: You dare to oppose me, Commissioner, knowing how much you stand to lose?\nDUPLESSIS: Time travel? Hasn’t that fool’s gold has caused enough deaths already? It isn’t worth it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 120\nGREEL: You’re the fool!\nDUPLESSIS: Your ambition has no limits, Magnus. But it’s all about you, not the Alliance. It has to end here.\nDUPLESSIS: Security! In here please.\nDUPLESSIS: What’s this? What are these creatures?\nNYSSA: (REALISATION) No, Magnus! You mustn’t-!\nGREEL: My guards, DuPlessis! Not yours. Your days are over.\nDUPLESSIS: (NERVOUSLY) Call them off.\nNYSSA: Please, Magnus! Call them off!\nGREEL: If the Alliance doesn’t want my leadership... I’1l sell myself elsewhere. Come on, Nyssa!\nNYSSA: No!\nDUPLESSIS: Security! Security! Answer!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. FINDECKER’S LAB\nFINDECKER: . Prisoner “One Zero Zero, Seven Four Two” - because that’s all you are now. It’s too late for vengeance, I’m afraid.\nRAGNAR: I knew that.\nFINDECKER: But you’re still an invaluable part of my research. So thank you, Ragnar Crezzen. Your circle is complete.\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING IN) Turn off the chamber, Findecker!\nFINDECKER: You! How did you get in here?\nTEGAN: Turn it off!\nDOCTOR: Out of my way!\nDOCTOR: POWERS DOWN.\nFINDECKER: Guards! G— (MUFFLED)\nCHOPS: (STIFLING FINDECKER) Keep it quiet, Chiefy!\nTEGAN: Ragnar’s still here! He didn’t get sent!\nDOCTOR: Turlough, help me get him out of there. (FX: HE & TURLOUGH RELEASING RAGNAR FROM CHAMBER THROUGH: )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 122\nTEGAN: We stopped you, Findecker. We changed Time! The circle’s broken!\nFINDECKER: Interfering dullards!\nCHOPS: Quiet.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor? Is Ragnar alright? He’s not moving.\nTEGAN: Oh, no...\nTURLOUGH: Look at his face. It’s withered, just like it was on the mountain.\nDOCTOR: He’s still breathing. But the Zygma beam has had its effect. We may have broken the loop and changed time. But at what cost?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: INT. ICELANDIC EMBASSY\nINGRID: Who’s there?\nGREEL: Good afternoon, Ingrid.\nINGRID: Magnus Greel? This is intolerable. When will my Embassy staff be released?\nGREEL: I came personally to apologise.\nINGRID: You expect me to believe that? After last night?\nGREEL: An unfortunate aberration.\nINGRID: You insulted the Icelandic Alliance.\nGREEL: And I am duly contrite. I see you still have our gift. I hope he’s behaving.\nINGRID: I demand a public apology.\nGREEL: Of course. Of course. But as you’1ll appreciate, in this unstable political climate, I find I must offer my services to the most reliable employers.\nINGRID: Minister Greel. We are hostages to your dog-brained guards.\nGREEL: Your embassy is under my protection, Commissioner.\nGREEL: Accept my services and I promise you and your staff safe passage home to Reykjavik. Nyssa and I shall accompany you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 124\nINGRID: Nyssa?\nGREEL: Of course. I know she was your agent, Ingrid.\nINGRID: As long as we know where we stand.\nGREEL: Besides, I have another gift for you.\nINGRID: Another dancing doll? This is laughable. I know what you want. You want asylum!\nGREEL: What I offer you will give the Icelandic Alliance supreme power over its opponents. The last enigma. The prize of time travel.\nINGRID: (ASTONISHED) Then... the rumours are true!\nGREEL: You see, Commissioner, you can hardly refuse.\nSIN: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 125"

Are you sure? If this is war, won’t there be — I don’t know, missiles flying about?\nTURLOUGH: (PATRONISINGLY) 51°* century war is formal combat - like playing chess. Convention insists that bombings are declared beforehand.\nTEGAN: Well, that’s me told.\nTURLOUGH: That’s what three years stuck in this timezone does for you.\nDOCTOR: There is, however, one small detail you won’t be aware of, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Such as?\nDOCTOR: I was with the Filipino Army on the Siberian floes, for entirely different reasons of course, when all this blew up.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL)\nTEGAN: You’re out there now?\nTURLOUGH: Now he tells us!\nDOCTOR: Once the bombardment starts, the city has only two\nDOCTOR: live. Could I borrow your comms unit for a moment?\nTURLOUGH: Erm... Of course. Here.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. There’s a call I need to make...\nDOCTOR: . if I can remember the number right.\nDOCTOR: Page 146\nDOCTOR: days\nDOCTOR: to\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78: INT. GREEL’S APARTMENT (REYKJAVIK)\nGREEL: Who’s that?\nDOCTOR: (D) It’s me, Magnus. Your friendly local Time Agent.\nGREEL: You! What are you after?\nDOCTOR: (D) Just to let you know we’re still watching you. You and your accomplice, Nyssa. Cheerio for now.\nGREEL: Wait. Wait!\nNYSSA: (ENTERING FROM OFF, SLEEPY) Magnus? What’s the matter?\nGREEL: (MANIC) Nyssa. You know him. You know that man!\nNYSSA: Who?\nGREEL: The one on the line. The one who keeps calling! The Time Agent!\nNYSSA: Magnus, dear, I don’t know who you mean. Why are you so angry?\nGREEL: (SOOTHING) Nyssa. Listen to me. I want you to remember those things you have forgotten. Those things you thought you’d lost.\nNYSSA: Things I’ve forgotten. Things I didn’t want to remember.\nGREEL: They’re all coming back now. Remember. The time ship. The blue box.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 148\nNYSSA: I remember. The TARDIS...\nGREEL: You know how to get into it, don’t you? That “TAR-DIS!” (BEAT)\nGREEL: Don’t you?!\nGREEL: WAIL.\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nGREEL: The bombardment. It’s started.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79: EXT. REYKJAVIK STREET\nDOCTOR WHO: EXPLOSIONS HIGH ON THE DOME.\nTEGAN: We should be undercover. There must be shelters somewhere.\nDOCTOR: The bombs won’t break through the city dome yet.\nTEGAN: You’re sure about that?\nTURLOUGH: (TO STOP) Hang on. There’s an air saloon pulling out of The Asgard.\nTEGAN: Hold on — that’s Nyssa in the back!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nTEGAN: She saw me. I know she did.\nDOCTOR: Right, come on then. (CALLING) Taxi!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80: INT. AIRCAR (IN MOTION)\nGREEL: There’s an aircar following us.\nNYSSA: Magnus. You’re getting paranoid.\nGREEL: Why did you want to marry me, Nyssa? For money? For position? Or simply out of cruelty?\nNYSSA: (CAUTIOUS) I see a lot to admire in you. Your dedication. Your determination.\nGREEL: But nothing to love.\nNYSSA: You can be cruel and egotistical. But I do care about you.\nGREEL: You could have had everything, Nyssa. But you’re a betrayer. We’re two of a kind. This world will turn on us whatever side we’re on. That’s why we have to get away.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81: INT. ANOTHER AIRCAR (IN MOTION)\nTEGAN: Hey, they’re turning off!\nTURLOUGH: That’s the Defence Ministry. We’ll never get in there. It’s like a fortress.\nDOCTOR: “Never” is probably the most annoying word in the universe. Pull over, please, driver!\nTEGAN: Except in “never say die”, right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Tegan.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 82: INT. DEFENCE MINISTRY — CORRIDOR\nINGRID: Through here.\nGREEL: Nyssa. This way.\nNYSSA: How is your son, Ingrid?\nINGRID: He'll live. He couldn’t understand the uproar. He thought the doll was playing a game.\nNYSSA: I’m so sorry.\nINGRID: But then he likes the bombing too.\nGREEL: And Mr Sin?\nINGRID: We've had one sighting. At the Piggery in the Market. Leaning over the wall, laughing at the other pigs.\nNYSSA: That’s horrible.\nINGRID: The sooner he’s caught and dismantled the better. (STOPS) Here we are.\nNYSSA: The TARDIS!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 153\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83: EXT. DEFENCE MINISTRY\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) Look at those guards. The Heavy Mob.\nTURLOUGH: (SOTTO) Buffalo hybrids. We’re never going to get past them!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) That word again. Comms unit, please, Turlough?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84: INT. DEFENCE MINISTRY — STOREROOM\nNYSSA: I told you, Magnus! I can’t open the TARDIS!\nGREEL: Can’t or won’t?\nNYSSA: I don’t have a key!\nGREEL: (MUTTER) You are compromising your safety, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Oh, I’ve been doing that for years! By working with you!\nINGRID: Greel! You promised us the secret of time travel. Is this the best you can do? This... this battered object. You can’t even open it!\nGREEL: We’1ll get the door forced.\nINGRID: What am I supposed to tell my Generals? And the Alliance?\nGREEL: Now what? (FX: BLIP)\nGREEL: DOCTOR (impersonating FINDECKER) (D, OVER FUZZY COMM) Greel. It’s taken long enough to find you.\nGREEL: (INCREDULOUS) Findecker? Is that you? There’s no picture.\nINGRID: At last. Your scientific advisor, I take it?\nGREEL: I thought you’d abandoned me!\nGREEL: DOCTOR (impersonating FINDECKER) (D) When I had yet to receive my fee? I’m outside the building. These cattle-brained Security guards refuse to admit me.\nINGRID: I can arrange that. (FX: BLIP) (INTO COMMS) Security. Let him through. Send him down.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 85: EXT. DEFENCE MINISTRY\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR (impersonating FINDECKER)\nDOCTOR WHO: There you are, you heard the lady. Let me pass!\nDOCTOR: (NORMAL VOICE, TO TEGAN AND TURLOUGH) Come along, you two.\nTURLOUGH: Full of surprises, aren’t you, Doctor?\nTEGAN: Isn’t he just?\nDOCTOR: The voice, the petulance, are easy enough to mimic. Hurry!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 86: INT. DEFENCE MINISTRY — STOREROOM\nGREEL: Now you’1ll see, Commissioner. Findecker will explain.\nINGRID: I hope so, Magnus. For your sake.\nGREEL: The double nexus particle. That’s the key. He discovered it. He’1ll explain. —\nGREEL: Ah, that’1ll be him now —\nINGRID: (AGHAST) That Sin creature!\nNYSSA: Magnus? How did that get in here?\nGREEL: I don’t know —\nNYSSA: It’s dangerous. (MOVING TOWARDS DOOR) Ingrid, come with me. We're leaving.\nGREEL: No! No! Stop her, Sin —\nGREEL: AND TURLOUGH RUNNING IN FROM OUTSIDE CORRIDOR]\nNYSSA: (CRIES OUT) No! Please! Get it off me —\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING IN) Greel! Call your creature off!\nGREEL: The Time Agent?! How—?!?\nTURLOUGH: You heard him!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 157\nGREEL: The secretary, too-?!\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING) Magnus, please!\nGREEL: Sin, stay! (BEAT) Oh, but this is perfect! Open up this ship of yours, Time Agent. You can transport me to a place of safety. No tricks, or Sin will kill Nyssa!\nTEGAN: Leave her alone, you monster!\nINGRID: Magnus Greel. Your overtures to our Alliance are no longer tenable. You will be publicly investigated for war crimes against humanity. Now release Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: Commissioner, be careful.\nTEGAN: That thing’s got a dagger!\nINGRID: That thing attacked my son! (SWATS AT SIN) Let her go, you foul\nINGRID: creature!\nNYSSA: Ingrid, don’t-! (THROWN ASIDE AS...)\nNYSSA: Ingrid!\nGREEL: Sin! Come to heel! Heel!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING TO INGRID) Alright. I’ve got her.\nNYSSA: She’s bleeding badly. She needs medical aid!\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Turlough. Get help!\nTEGAN: You heard the man, Turlough! Come on!\nNYSSA: (HARDLY DARING TO BELIEVE IT) Doctor... I thought you'd never find us.\nDOCTOR: We need to keep her warm.\nNYSSA: Here. Lift her head.\nDOCTOR: (RAISING INGRID’S HEAD) I’m only sorry it took so long.\nDOCTOR: (FX: INGRID BREATHES HER LAST) What with everything you’ve been through. —\nNYSSA: Ingrid’s dead, Doctor.\nGREEL: And she won’t be the last. Sin’s just getting started! Unless you open up your ship!\nDOCTOR: No, Magnus. Your future’s elsewhere. But you’re not getting a lift there in my TARDIS!\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: A pan-temporal beacon. I’m calling the only person who can help him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL)\nGREEL: Page 159\nGREEL: Help from you? I’d rather rot in Hell! Follow me, Mr Sin!\nNYSSA: Magnus! Doctor, I have to go after him.\nDOCTOR: No! Nyssa! Wait!\nNYSSA: (EXITING, CALLING BACK) I’m sorry! I have to!\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: STARTS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 160\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 87: INT. DEFENCE MINISTRY — CORRIDOR\nTURLOUGH: Doctor! There’s a medical team on its way.\nDOCTOR: Too late for that. The Commissioner’s dead.\nTEGAN: (RUNNING UP BEHIND TURLOUGH) Dead! But...\nDOCTOR: Did you see them, either of you?\nTEGAN: Who?\nDOCTOR: Greel! With Sin!\nTURLOUGH: What?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa followed them — (SPOTS SOMETHING ON FLOOR) Ah!\nTEGAN: Blood?\nDOCTOR: Ingrid’s. From Sin’s dagger. They’re up on the roof!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, the bombing’s intensified. We have to get out!\nDOCTOR: Turlough, any guards you see — send them the wrong way.\nTURLOUGH: The wrong way?\nDOCTOR: Whatever else happens, it’s imperative that Magnus Greel\nDOCTOR: allowed to escape!\nDOCTOR: is\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 161\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 88: EXT. ROOF\nGREEL: (BREATHLESS) No way down. Which way down, Sin?\nNYSSA: (APPROACHING) Magnus! Magnus, wait! (STOPS) Please, listen.\nGREEL: No, Sin! Leave her! I said, “Leave!”\nNYSSA: Come inside, Magnus. The bombing’s getting worse. It’s not safe.\nGREEL: What’s the matter, Nyssa? You’ve spent two years trying to destroy me — don’t you want to be there at the end?\nNYSSA: This isn’t the end, Magnus!\nGREEL: What, you mean — you care? Because I did! I cared!\nNYSSA: No, I mean —\nGREEL: Ohh, you’ve been talking to your Time Agent friend, haven’t you? What was it he said? My future is elsewhere? I have no future.\nNYSSA: Magnus, please. Get back from the edge!\nTURLOUGH: (OFF, RUNNING) There they are!\nDOCTOR: (OFF, RUNNING) Greel. Wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 162\nGREEL: (LAUGHING) And here he is! You see? There’s no escape! Get rid of them. I don’t want an audience!\nTEGAN: (RUNNING UP) Nyssa, stop him! He’s gonna — [jump! ]\nTEGAN: Oh no, you don’t! (GRABS GREEL)\nGREEL: (STRUGGLING WITH TEGAN) Let me go, woman-!\nTEGAN: No! You’re a killer — a mass murderer! You destroyed my home!\nTEGAN: You’re standing trial, and I’1ll be first in line as a witness!\nGREEL: (STRUGGLING) I shall take you with me-!\nDOCTOR: No! Stop!\nGREEL: (DISTRACTED, LETS TEGAN GO) Findecker’s cabinet-?!\nFINDECKER: What is this? Who summoned me? Greel!\nDOCTOR: You don’t have a choice, Magnus. Get away now. Go with your partner in crime.\nFINDECKER: With me? I am still unpaid!\nNYSSA: That cabinet’s not safe. Anyone can see that.\nDOCTOR: Who knows, one of them might survive!\nTEGAN: What are you doing, Doctor? They both have to face charges!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 163\nTURLOUGH: Greel caused this war! We can’t let him go!\nDOCTOR: His destiny is elsewhere! It can’t be changed!\nTEGAN: Well, Ragnar survived!\nDOCTOR: Did he?\nTEGAN: (STUNNED) What?\nFINDECKER: And what makes you think I’1l take Greel?\nGREEL: Who cares about you, you leech! I’m going anyway. There’s not room for both of us. Sin!\nTURLOUGH: Findecker! Look out!\nTEGAN: No!\nGREEL: Sin! Over here. Inside now! (SIN TROTS UP TO CABINET) (TO DOCTOR) This destiny you promise, Time Agent — will it be glorious?\nDOCTOR: Just go, Greel!\nGREEL: Nyssa? Come with me. Come on! We can burn together!\nNYSSA: No, Magnus. I don’t belong with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 164\nGREEL: Then — goodbye, my love. And thank you. You’ve given me my future back!\nGREEL: BEAT.\nTURLOUGH: Findecker’s dead.\nNYSSA: It’s all over, then.\nTEGAN: Is it, Doctor..? Is it really ‘all over’?\nTURLOUGH: I think the bombing’s stopped.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Tegan. It’s all over.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 165\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 89: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nNYSSA: I first met him on an official visit to the hospital.\nTURLOUGH: That was a trick, of course. We knew Greel had been secretly investing in medical research.\nDOCTOR: But not its actual nature.\nNYSSA: After that, it was easy to get into his circle.\nTEGAN: I’m still amazed at how brave you were. Both of you.\nNYSSA: It didn’t always feel like bravery.\nTEGAN: You don’t mean —\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Tegan.\nTEGAN: Well, I mean — you didn’t really love him, did you? You couldn’t have. —\nNYSSA: He was a monster, Tegan. But even monsters deserve a chance. And there were moments when Magnus was very honourable.\nTEGAN: Moments!\nDOCTOR: Some monsters are irredeemable.\nTURLOUGH: Where does Greel go now? Do you really know, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I, er — (FX: FIDDLES WITH CONSOLE) Yes.\nTEGAN: (SUSPICIOUS) Were you there?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BUTCHER OF BRISBANE by Marc Platt (FINAL) Page 166\nDOCTOR: It’s history, Tegan. That’s all you need to know.\nTEGAN: And in the 51** century? Has the war really ended?\nDOCTOR: Ah, now that’s something I was able to sort out.\nNYSSA: You were-?\nTURLOUGH: He phoned himself.\nNYSSA: What?\nTURLOUGH: Via the Filipino Army. Out on the glacier.\nTEGAN: So the bombing’s off? They’ve all gone home?\nDOCTOR: It seems World War Six has indeed been averted.\nNYSSA: Was this a former self you spoke to?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.\nTEGAN: Do you know everything that’s coming, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I couldn’t say, Tegan. I wouldn’t dare.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
