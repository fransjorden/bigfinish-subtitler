Had quite a rough ride on the way here — and I don’t mind telling you, it was a bit, you know, seat-of-the-old-pants a couple of times with those containers. I mean, you wouldn’t want one of them splitting open mid-flight, would you? Eh? Eh? Hello? Hello! Hello, Amethyst —\nFRATALIN: [INFINITE PATIENCE] Please stick to procedure, commander. The recorder is running.\nETHERON: [DISTORT]\nETHERON: Oh.. Oh, I see. Er... sorry. Um.

In some kind of coma.\nCHARLEY: Years?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: Yes.\nCHARLEY: Oh my God. You’re not serious. Years? Really? It feels like—\nDOCTOR: You were infected with something... you still are. It’s a virus of some kind.\nCHARLEY: Virus? I’ve got a virus?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And you shouldn’t have. Not in the TARDIS. The old girl’s defences should protect—\nCHARLEY: What kind of virus?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Apart from putting you in a coma, I can’t work out what else it does. And believe you me, I’ve tried long and hard to find out.\nCHARLEY: How many... years?\nDOCTOR: Well, time is relative in the TARDIS.. but it’s been a long time.\nCHARLEY: So... not that it’s any of my business, I suppose... but what have you been doing all this time?\nDOCTOR: I identified the virus’s molecular signature and... I’ve been trying to find out where it came from. If I can find the source, then—\nCHARLEY: You can cure me? Is that all you’ve been worrying about, all this time?\nDOCTOR: Well... there’ve been a few... [CLEARS THROUGH] detours.\nCHARLEY: [SMILING] You mean... you’ve got caught up a few scrapes?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 14\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t put it quite like that, but...

Are you content?\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 246: [DISTORT] Content in all tasks, thank you. Will you permit a personal query?\nFRATALIN: I can tell something is troubling you, 246.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 246: [DISTORT] Yes. I am troubled by what the commander of the cargo ship said about—\nFRATALIN: Commander Etheron is from a less disciplined species, 246, one of the ‘singulars’ - they are not like us. And\nFRATALIN: he has gone. We will most likely never have contact with him again. You should concentrate on the job in hand, 246.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 246: [DISTORT] But he seemed... afraid... of the Viyrans. And... whenever\nFRATALIN: they are mentioned... I feel fear.\nFRATALIN: We have our duty to perform, 246. The great work to be done here is all that matters. Focus on that.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 246: [DISTORT] I know you are correct, Fratalin, but I still feel—\nFRATALIN: A SMALL ALARM BLEEPS.\nFRATALIN: I’m registering.. an intrusion.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 246: [DISTORT] [SCARED] The Viyrans?\nFRATALIN: I’m transmitting location co-ordinates to all familiars.\nFRATALIN: BLEEP OF TRANSMISSION.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: COMMS BLEEP.\nDOCTOR WHO: BEHIND THE FOLLOWING LINES, WE CAN HEAR THE TARDIS MATERIALIZE ON DISTORT.\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: [DISTORT]\nDOCTOR WHO: Control Centre! This is 557. There is a molecular disturbance! An intruding object is solidifying adjacent to the Containment Vaults.\nDOCTOR WHO: TARDIS MATERIALIZATION IS COMPLETE.\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN’S SCREEN ACTIVATES.\nFRATALIN: I have visual contact. The physical configuration is unfamiliar.\nFRATALIN: ON DISTORT, THE SOUND OF THE TARDIS DOOR OPENING.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Oh... hello.\nFRATALIN: Another singular. Apprehend him. Purify.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: [DISTORT] You will stand still.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Of course. I’m perfectly harmless, you know. Er... what’s\nDOCTOR: that?\nDOCTOR: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: The atmosphere in the station must remain sterile. You are an intrusion. There will be impurities.\nDOCTOR: I see... but are you quite sure that thing won’t harm me in any— ?\nDOCTOR: A WHOOSH AS THE PURIFIER FIRES. SUSTAINED FOR A FEW SECONDS.\nDOCTOR: [A BIT STUNNED, SPLUTTERS] Um... yes. Well, I’m sure that was completely necessary. The taste of carbolic soap won’t be lingering for too long, I hope?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: You will come with me.\nDOCTOR: Naturally. Where are we going?\nFRATALIN: To see Fratalin, the Station Supervisor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, and who are you?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: I am Fratalin.\nDOCTOR: Mm... I see. Actually, I don’t, but sometimes it’s better not to let questions get in the way of a good mystery. Lead on... er...

I knew you’d come back—(BEAT) I’m sorry, I was expecting someone else.\nMILA: Doctor, there’s something different about this one. Why would she be expecting someone else?\nDOCTOR: Someone else? I hadn’t realised dimensionally transcendental vehicles disguised as Police Boxes were quite so commonplace.\nMILA: The TARDIS doesn’t like her.\nMILA: ‘WHAM’, WE’RE BACK IN THE ZERO ROOM AS CHARLEY AWAKES WITH A START AGAIN.\nMILA: MILA’S VOICE SOUNDS SLIGHTLY INDISTINCT IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SCENE. A BIT FUZZY.\nCHARLEY: What? The TARDIS doesn’t— [GASPS] Ooooh, my head.\nMILA: I remember that. [REFERRING TO HEADACHE]\nCHARLEY: Wha— ? Oh. Who... ? Oh God, I’m delirious or something, aren’t I?\nMILA: I don’t know. You seem very awake to me, Charlotte Pollard.\nCHARLEY: [THINKING IT’S NOT REAL] Yes, that’s right. I’m awake and talking to an out-of-focus person. Morning, how are you? And what’s your name, then?\nMILA: Mila.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 19\nCHARLEY: ‘Mee-la’? And what are you, then? Someone I met and have forgotten all about? Or is this delirium so bad that I’m just making up fuzzy-edged looking girls.\nMILA: I’ve known you quite a while. You’re very special to me.\nCHARLEY: Am I? Fascinating. [DISMISSING IT] Oh, this is just completely ridiculous. Doctor! Doctor! [DISCONCERTED BY THE FLOATING] Ooooh! Whoops... This floating around takes some getting used to. [A SUDDEN THOUGHT] Hang on.\nCHARLEY: If I’m actually in this Zero Room place... then—\nMILA: You’re awake. Yes. Although, of course, you could be just dreaming that you’re awake. But you’re not, though.\nCHARLEY: Ah yes, but you would say that, wouldn’t you?\nMILA: [LAUGHS] You’re funny. I like that. I want to be as funny as you.\nCHARLEY: Er.. do you? That’s nice. Doctor!\nCHARLEY: PAUSE. Um... What do you remember?\nMILA: What do you mean?\nCHARLEY: When I woke up, you said ‘I remember that’.\nMILA: Oh... your head was hurting.\nCHARLEY: Tt. 'Stadi -1s:.\nMILA: I remember that happening to me to start with.\nCHARLEY: To start with?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 20\nMILA: And there’s no use calling for the Doctor. He’s left the TARDIS.\nCHARLEY: Has he? How would you know?\nMILA: Oh, I know everything about the Doctor. He’1l be out exploring. He likes doing that.\nCHARLEY: [SUSPICIOUS] Yes... I know. [TO THE POINT] What do you mean, you know everything about the Doctor?\nMILA: Well, he’s the greatest enemy of the Daleks, for a start. Did you know that?\nCHARLEY: Yes, I did, actually.\nMILA: Oh yes, because of that time you thought you were on Spiridon?\nCHARLEY: What?\nMILA: With the Cyropyts? And the Thals?\nCHARLEY: How do you know about that? Oh, of course... if I’m just imagining you—\nMILA: [A BIT CROSS] I know more than that! I know it all. Well, nearly all of it. For example, did you know the Doctor didn’t always look like he does now?\nCHARLEY: Um... Yes. And you only know that because I know, because you’re the product of my feverish imagination. I have\nCHARLEY: got a fever, haven’t I? I mean, I feel pretty rotten.\nMILA: [CAUGHT UP IN A FOND MEMORY] He seemed to be so old when I first met him. [WITH A CHUCKLE] And he was so grumpy!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: I think he was pretending most of the time. And he had such a sparkle in his eye. But then he changed—\nCHARLEY: What are you talking about?\nMILA: His hair got darker for one thing. It was like a sort of mop. It was silver before... but when he changed, he played around a lot more. [CHUCKLES WARMLY] He used to\nMILA: make me laugh. He made them all laugh... [SUDDENLY SERIOUS] those girls. They all loved him. But they left. Every single one of them. None of them stay. [ACCUSING] And neither will you, Charley. You’1ll leave, just like all the rest of them.\nCHARLEY: Um... ?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: 7.

HIS FOOTSTEPS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOFT PADDING OF FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557.\nDOCTOR: Now that was impressive. Exactly what speed were we travelling at in that train thing?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: The shuttle train was travelling at maximum speed.\nDOCTOR: Maximum, eh? Mmm... very impressive. Er... and there are trains like that all over this... base?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: This station is over seventy-five siberuds in mass.\nDOCTOR: [TO HIMSELF ] ‘Siberuds’. That’s not translating very well. Strange.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557:\nDOCTOR: [IGNORING HIM] There are only eight hundred of us. If we are to do our jobs well, we must have the fastest means of transport available.\nDOCTOR: Oh.. well, of course. Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: This is the control centre. Through here.\nDOCTOR: DOOR BUZZES OPEN.\nFRATALIN: [FROM INSIDE] Bring the singular in, 557.\nFRATALIN: THEY MOVE INTO THE CONTROL CENTRE. WE GO WITH THEM. CONTROLS ARE TICKING OVER.

Conjoin.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: Of course.\nFRATALIN: HE PADS FORWARD. WE HEAR A SQUELCHY, CONNECTION SOUND.\nDOCTOR: Now that’s... fascinating. And something I’ve never seen before. No wonder you call me ‘singular’.\nDOCTOR: THE SQUELCHY SOUND OF THEM DISCONNECTING.\nFRATALIN: Thank you, 557. You may continue with your duties.\nFRATALIN: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 557: Yes, Supervisor.\nFRATALIN: HE PADS OUT AND DOOR BUZZES SHUT BEHIND HIM.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, are you both part of the same creature, or are you just... uniquely compatible in some way.\nFRATALIN: You have never met a Chogrophin before?\nDOCTOR: Evidently not.\nFRATALIN: I have seven hundred and ninety-nine Familiars. All individuals, but also part of me.\nDOCTOR: You must take up rather a lot of space when you all... *‘conjoin’?\nFRATALIN: Mass conjoining only takes place in times of dire need.\nDOCTOR: Dire need? And what qualifies as dire n—?\nFRATALIN: You are here to answer my questions.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 24\nDOCTOR: I do beg your pardon. Fire away.\nDOCTOR: MILA’S VOICE IS STILL FUZZY, BUT IT HAS GOT A LITTLE CLEARER.\nMILA: [LAUGHING, CAUGHT UP IN THE MEMORY] And the scarf was so long that—\nCHARLEY: Just.. hang on a minute! How do you know all this?\nMILA: The TARDIS is my home. I’ve been here with the Doctor for.. well, such a long time. A long, long time.\nCHARLEY: That doesn’t make sense.\nMILA: Yes it does! I’m his companion!\nCHARLEY: Oh really? Then why hasn’t he ever mentioned you?\nCHARLEY: PAUSE. Well? MILA STARTS TO SOB.\nCHARLEY: Look... I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. But... Well, I need to know... Mila?\nCHARLEY: MILA’S SOBBING SUBSIDES. How did you get into the TARDIS?\nMILA: I escaped from them. You see, I’d heard about the Doctor. I knew they hated him. They hated him because he’d beaten them. I think... I think they were scared of him. So I thought, this is the man I want to be with. The man who scares the Daleks!\nCHARLEY: The Daleks? You escaped from the Daleks?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 25\nMILA: Yes. I hid from them for ages. On one of their space ships. They couldn’t find me. No one could find me.\nMILA: And then one day, I managed to get into one of their time machines.\nCHARLEY: A Dalek time machine?\nMILA: Yes. They were chasing the Doctor through time and space, you see. And I thought, They’re bound to find him eventually, and when they do, that’s when I can get aboard the TARDIS! Do you see?\nCHARLEY: Um... I’m not sure exactly what I see...\nMILA: And it worked. It worked, didn’t it?\nCHARLEY: [SIDLING TO THE DOOR] Er... why don’t you just wait here while I find the Doctor?\nMILA: I told you, he’s gone out exploring—\nCHARLEY: I know, but all the same, perhaps I should check to see—\nMILA: [SUDDENLY AGGRESSIVE] There’s no point!\nCHARLEY: [SUSPICIOUS] Why? Have you done something to him? What are you doing here anyway? [SUDDENLY FEELING ILL] Oooh... what’s the matter with me?\nCHARLEY: THE EBBING AND FLOWING SOUND.\nCHARLEY: I feel... terrible... Oooh... urgh...\nMILA: You’ re leaving, Charley.\nCHARLEY: What? What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 26\nMILA: You’re going to leave the Doctor.\nFRATALIN: So your proposition is that you are a traveller in time, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And space. Sorry, do go on. I must say I’m encouraged that you don’t find the proposition preposterous.\nFRATALIN: I find nothing preposterous, Doctor. It would be a waste of my energies. The universe is full of possibilities.\nFRATALIN: It is simpler to embrace than reject.\nDOCTOR: How refreshing.\nFRATALIN: And why do you travel in time and space?\nDOCTOR: [FLOORED FOR A MOMENT] Oooh, er, any number of reasons really.\nFRATALIN: This is a secure facility and I have security functions to fulfil, so please, be more precise. Is your\nFRATALIN: proposition that you arrived here entirely by chance?\nDOCTOR: Actually, no, not in this case. And.. well, I was wondering if you could help me... ?\nFRATALIN: Proceed.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you could say I’m on a kind of quest. A friend of mine, someone who’s travelling with me, has fallen\nDOCTOR: zit bel\nFRATALIN: Ill. Can you expand on that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: Not with any great degree of accuracy, I’m afraid. All I know is that she has some kind of virus. My ship should be impervious to such things, but.. well, in this case it wasn’t and I’m not sure why— anyway, I-— [was wondering]\nFRATALIN: A virus?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Her condition seems to be stable... although I’m not really sure. But I’ve been tracing the spacio-temporal spore of the virus. Very tricky. There’ve been a lot of blind alleys and detours. But I got my strongest readings to date on my way here... to Amethyst. What is Amethyst, by the way? Is it the name of a planet or—-?\nFRATALIN: The nature of this facility is top secret, as laid down by The Great Armistice Treaty.\nDOCTOR: ‘Armistice’ ?\nFRATALIN: And you came here looking for a virus?\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, um.. I did. Is that all right?\nFRATALIN: You are in breach of security protocols.\nDOCTOR: Am I?\nFRATALIN: If you know about the viruses we have stored here, then\nDOCTOR: You have viruses here? Then, this—\nFRATALIN: . there is only one course of action for me to take. You have no security classification, which means you are a potential saboteur.\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not.\nFRATALIN: There is no other available classification.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR: But I thought you had an open mind—\nFRATALIN: The penalty is execution.\nDOCTOR: I thought things were going rather too\nDOCTOR: well.\nDOCTOR: Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS AS CHARLEY APPROACHES.\nCHARLEY: [ENTERING] Hmm... certainly sounds as if we’ve landed. Let’s see... Scanner...\nCHARLEY: SHE ACTIVATES THE TARDIS’S SCANNER. Definitely landed. Huh, a metal corridor. Great. MILA’S VOICE IS CLEARER STILL.\nMILA: What are you doing?\nCHARLEY: Where did you spring from? I really am hallucinating aren’t I? What’s wrong with me?\nMILA: I’ve told you. You’ re—\nCHARLEY: Yes, I’m leaving, that’s right. And in actual fact, I am. I’m going outside to find the Doctor— God, why am I even bothering to talk to you? You’re just... just— Hey, wait a minute, there’s something different about you.\nMILA: Is there?\nCHARLEY: You’re not so fuzzy about the edges. Sort of clearer to look at. What does that mean?\nMILA: What do you think?\nCHARLEY: Oh... I’m feeling too awful to bother about talking to hallucinations, get out of my way, I’m going.\nCHARLEY: DOOR CONTROL ACTIVATES. Er.. would you mind getting out of my way, please? [SHE\nCHARLEY: DOESN’T, SO, INTENDING TO PUSH MILA OUT OF THE WAY] Right—\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SHE STRIDES FORWARD. THE STRANGE EBBING SOUND. Urgh.. What? Oh, now I know you’re not real.\nMILA: Why’s that?\nCHARLEY: [IRRITATED] Because I just walked right through you! Uuuugh.. and I feel really terrible for it too. [A FEW\nCHARLEY: DEEP BREATHS, LIKE SHE’S FEELING SICK] I don’t understand...\nMILA: You really don’t get it, do you?\nCHARLEY: Get what?\nMILA: You must know that you’re different.\nCHARLEY: [GETTING A LITTLE ANXIOUS] Different? What do you mean?\nMILA: Different from all the others.\nCHARLEY: Wh-?\nMILA: They were all protected by the TARDIS, but not you. Not you, Charley. Everything about you is... wrong.\nCHARLEY: Wrong? What are you saying?\nMILA: You must know. It’s like you’re not supposed to be here. This... space... doesn’t belong to you. And that’s why you’re the one I truly love. You’re like me... like I was... an outsider.\nCHARLEY: [DEEPLY DISTURBED. QUIETLY] I’m not listening to any more of this.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: CHARLEY WALKS OUT. THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HER.\nMILA: [TO HERSELF] Yes. Perhaps it’d be best if you did leave now. Leave me here to be by the Doctor’s side.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: A SHUTTLE TRAIN WHOOSHES PAST. CROSS-FADE TO INTERIOR.\nDOCTOR: So where exactly are we going? And what number are you, by the way?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: I am 665.\nDOCTOR: Not as talkative as Fratalin himself, are you?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665:\nDOCTOR: I am Fratalin himself. But I have been given one function. To carry out your execution. I hope you’re not thinking of attempting escape.\nDOCTOR: Why, what would you do if I was?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665:\nDOCTOR: I would dispose of you now by enveloping you. I understand that singular species such as yourself have no facility for conjoining. The process would, I am told, suffocate you.\nDOCTOR: A FEW WARNING, SQUELCHING SOUNDS FROM THE CREATURE.\nDOCTOR: I think you may well be right, 665, old chap. You Chogrophins really are totally unique, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: I see that you are enjoying your state of fascination.\nDOCTOR: Er.. yes I am. It’s always good to learn something new. That’s probably why the TARDIS was having some trouble translating that word of yours. What was it? ‘Siberud?’ This must be one of the remotest parts of space-time the old girl’s ever travelled to.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: It is a pity for you that your fascination will be so\nDOCTOR: short-lived.\nDOCTOR: THE TRAIN WHOOSHES TO A HALT.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 33\nDOCTOR: We’ve arrived, have we? What is it, a squelching squad at dawn?\nDOCTOR: DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: Step forward, please.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS.\nDOCTOR: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: DOOR CLOSES BEHIND THEM.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: This is the waste vent.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’re not throwing me out with the rubbish, are you? I hate the smell of old bins!\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665:\nDOCTOR: There is no waste in the Amethyst Station. We are buried deep beneath the surface of a lava planet. You will be vented into molten lava.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 34\nCHARLEY: [FEELING REALLY SICK] I must be going mad... [A STAB OF PAIN] Oh, Doctor, where have you landed us this time?\nCHARLEY: AN ALARM SUDDENLY SOUNDS. TWO HOWLS, THEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT, TWO HOWLS, THEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT, AND SO ON.\nCHARLEY: Wha—?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN [RECORDED VOICE ECHOING OVER SPEAKERS]: Biological Alert! Biological Alert!\nCHARLEY: Biological... ? Doctor! Doctor, where are you?!?\nCHARLEY: HER VOICE ECHOES OFF THROUGH THE CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: 13. OMITTED.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: WASTE VENT DOOR OPENS NOISILY AND VIOLENTLY. CLANGS OPEN.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BIOLOGICAL ALERT SIREN CAN BE HEARD IN THE BACKGROUND, TOGETHER WITH THE ‘BIOLOGICAL ALERT’ ANNOUNCEMENT.\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: You will enter the waste vent airlock.\nDOCTOR: Um... what exactly is a biological alert? Ina station full of viruses, isn’t that a bit of a worry?\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: It is no concern of yours.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? It sounds like trouble, and I’m a handy man to have in your corner when there’s trouble about.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: It would not surprise me if you were the cause of the trouble. In!\nDOCTOR: WITH A SHOVE, THE DOCTOR IS PROPELLED THROUGH THE DOOR.\nDOCTOR: [CRIES OUT AS HE IS PUSHED INTO THE AIRLOCK. ]\nDOCTOR: AIRLOCK DOOR CLANGS SHUT, VIOLENTLY.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: 665 to Amethyst Control.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 37\nDOCTOR WHO: COMMS BLEEP. BIOLOGICAL ALERT IN BACKGROUND.\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: [DISTORT] The Doctor is now in the ejection vent.\nFRATALIN: Thank you, 665. Open the vent and complete the execution.\nFRATALIN: COMMS BLEEP.\nFRATALIN: This is the supervisor to all Familiars. I am registering a biological alert in the containment zone, close to the intruder’s craft - intersection Blue Zero, Zero Four. Scanners identify viral leakage conforms to the Type 7001 batch. Any familiar close to this intersection, please move to investigate.\nFRATALIN: SCREEN ACTIVATES.\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Doctor!\nFRATALIN: There is a female singular. Apprehend her.\nFRATALIN: COMMS BLEEP. FRATALIN 354: [DISTORT]\nFRATALIN: This is 354, I am approaching the intersection, Supervisor.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR IS HAMMERING ON METAL DOOR.\nDOCTOR: Is there any chance you might reconsider?!? [SIGHS,\nDOCTOR: DEFEATED] No way out.\nDOCTOR: VENT DOOR CLUNKS. SERVOES START TO WHIRR. THE SIZZLE AND ROAR OF LAVA MUFFLED AND BECOMING CLEARER.\nDOCTOR: There must be better ways to die. Sorry, Charley.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: A SQUELCHING SOUNDS AS CHARLEY IS GRABBED BY FRATALIN FAMILIAR 545.\nCHARLEY: Aargh! Get off me! Who are you?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: I am Fratalin Familiar 354. You are identified as a biological risk. You must be contained.\nCHARLEY: What? But... where... where’s the Doctor?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: He is a saboteur and is being executed.\nCHARLEY: What? No!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: [DISTORT] Waste vent now opening. The Doctor will be dead in seconds.\nFRATALIN: Thank you, 665.\nFRATALIN: A TINY BLEEPING ALARM.\nFRATALIN: What.. ? I am registering... something... unusual.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: VENT DOOR OPENS, LAVA HISSES AND BURNS AS IT POURS IN.\nDOCTOR: This is it, then, Doctor. No chance of regeneration, buried under a planet-full of molten lava.\nDOCTOR: SUDDENLY THE LAVA HISSES AND SEEMS TO RECEDE.\nDOCTOR: What? What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: A MATERIALIZATION SOUND WHOOSHES THROUGH THE LAVA SOUND AS IT RECEDES AND THE OUTER DOOR CLOSES.\nDOCTOR: [DARKLY] How ironic.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Materialization complete.\nDOCTOR: Rescued by the Daleks...\nDOCTOR: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: PART 2.\nDOCTOR WHO: 20. OMITTED.\nDOCTOR WHO: COMMS BLEEP.\nFRATALIN: [ IMPATIENT ] 665, has the execution of the Doctor been completed? 665, respond please.\nFRATALIN: COMMS BLEEP. A BURST OF STATIC. SOMETHING’ S GONE WRONG WITH THE COMM.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Hello? Hello?\nFRATALIN: Doctor? You should be dead.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] I know, it must be infuriating for you - and it wasn’t even me who hacked into your comms system.\nFRATALIN: Who was it, then?\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Well, I’ve got a squad of three Daleks here with me.\nFRATALIN: Three what?\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT]\nDOCTOR: Daleks. You’ve never heard of them?\nFRATALIN: I’ve never heard of them. 665, open the outer vent door immediately.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT]\nDOCTOR: The Daleks have deactivated it. And for some unfathomable reason, they’re rather reluctant to damage any part of this station - unless they absolutely have to, of course. So - and I can’t believe I’m actually saying this — they’re asking you to open the door, or they’1l blast it open.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: CONTROLS ARE HASTILY ACTIVATED.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Fratalin? What are you doing?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 44\nDALEK ONE: Transmission detected!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: A distress signal is being transmitted from this station.\nDOCTOR: Well, perhaps if you’d just blown up the door without getting me to ask so politely—\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Silence!\nDOCTOR: Please yourselves.\nDALEK TWO: Alert, energy readings indicate full station security systems being activated!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Destroy the door immediately before force-fields are activated!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: DALEKS ONE & TWO: We obey!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: DALEK GUNS FIRE. AN ALMIGHT EXPLOSION AS THE DOOR SPLITS AND CLANGS TO THE FLOOR IN TWO HEAVY PIECES.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 665: Aaaaargh! [CRUSHED AND KILLED]\nDOCTOR: [QUIETLY] Oh no.\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT] No! Doctor! Doctor, what’s happening?\nFRATALIN: SOUND OF THE DALEKS GLIDING FORWARDS.\nDOCTOR: They’ve destroyed the door... unfortunately your familiar,\nDOCTOR: 665, was standing behind it. He was killed by the—\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT] I know! I felt it!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: I’m so— [sorry]\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Silence! Attention! You will deactivate all your defence systems immediately!\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT] Doctor, who are these friends of yours?\nDOCTOR: They’re no friends of mine, Fratalin, I can assure you of that.\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT]\nFRATALIN: And why should I believe you? You are part of an attacking force, invading this station, and you will be treated as such.\nFRATALIN: COMMS CUT OFF.\nDOCTOR: Can’t say I blame him.\nDALEK ONE: Defence systems are blocking our scanners. Our search\nDALEK ONE: will be impaired.\nDOCTOR: What are you searching for?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You will begin the search now, set all perceptors to\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: maximum. Proceed!\nDALEKS: We obey!\nDALEKS: DALEKS MOVE OFF SWIFTLY. DALEK HEAD TURNS TO THE DOCTOR.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: The creature called Fratalin referred to you as ‘Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Er... did he? I don’t remember that.\nDOCTOR: A SCANNING NOISE STARTS EMITTING FROM THE DALEK.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 46\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Transmitting your image to Dalek Control.\nDOCTOR: Dalek control, and where exactly is that? Out there in\nDOCTOR: the middle of the molten lava?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You will be silent!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: FADE UP SCANNING/TRANSMISSION NOISE. CROSS-FADE TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 47\nDALEK COMMANDER: This is the one referred to as ‘the Doctor’. Feed information to Dalek Time Controller.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Dalek Time Controller receiving.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: A MISH-MASH OF ECHOING CLIPS FROM THE DOCTORS\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Identity confirmed. This is our greatest enemy. The Time Lord. The Doctor.\nDALEK COMMANDER: He must be exterminated!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: No!\nDALEK COMMANDER: No? He is our greatest enemy! He must die!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: There are spacio-temporal imperatives we must obey. Any deviation could mean the failure of our mission.\nDALEK COMMANDER: But, the Doctor—!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: His presence in this time zone was not foreseen. We do not know what his purpose is here. We cannot risk destabilizing events. Our imperatives are to recapture Patient Zero and locate the viruses.\nDALEK COMMANDER: But the Doctor will attempt to impede our imperatives!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The Doctor is resourceful. We must use that\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: resourcefulness. For now, he must be kept alive.\nDALEK COMMANDER: [RELUCTANTLY] Very well.\nDALEK COMMANDER: COMMS BLEEP.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: The Doctor will be your prisoner. Use his knowledge to achieve your goals.\nDOCTOR WHO: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 49\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: I understand.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes? Been talking to someone have you? What exactly are the Daleks doing here?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You will take me to the control area.\nDOCTOR: Find your own way.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: This station’s security systems are blocking my scanners. Do you know where the control area is?\nDOCTOR: What if I say no?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: I have orders to use you as a resource, Doctor. If you are not useful, you will die.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: PAUSE.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Well?!?\nDOCTOR: [NONCHALANTLY] Er... it’s this way. Keep up.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: KERCHUNK OF BARS LOCKING INTO PLACE.\nCHARLEY: What are you going to do now? Just leave me here, behind bars?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354:\nCHARLEY: In this containment area, you are isolated from the Station’s air supply. Once the airlock to this room is sealed, there will be no further risk of viral contamination.\nCHARLEY: What sort of station is this?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: All matters relating to Amethyst’s purpose are top secret.\nCHARLEY: Ooh top secret— ugh [FEELING FAINT]\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: You are exhibiting symptoms of viral infection.\nCHARLEY: Oh... thanks... nice bedside manner. Ugh... have you got anything I can take for it?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: There are no cures for any of the viruses held here. You will soon be dead.\nCHARLEY: Wha—?\nCHARLEY: AN ALERT CHIME. THREE BLASTS.\nCHARLEY: What does that mean?\nCHARLEY: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: That is an intrusion alert.\nCHARLEY: COMMS BLEEP.\nCHARLEY: 354 to control centre.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 51\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT] The Doctor has escaped execution and has brought other aliens into Amethyst. All familiars are called to the control centre for mass conjoining.\nFRATALIN: FAMILIAR 354 STARTS TO PAD OUT OF THE ROOM.\nCHARLEY: Wait a minute! Come back! Please! Did he say the\nCHARLEY: Doctor had escaped? Please! You can’t...\nCHARLEY: DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS AS FAMILIAR 354 LEAVES.\nCHARLEY: [DEFEATED] can’t just... leave me... here... ugh... to die. [SHE PASSES OUT]\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 52\nFRATALIN: All familiars will return to the control centre immediately.\nFRATALIN: DOCTOR’S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, ALONG WITH THE SOUND OF THE DALEK MOVING.\nDOCTOR: [APPROACHING, SOME WAY OFF] Hello again, Fratalin. It’s me! Sorry about the company I’m keeping.\nFRATALIN: I would advise you to come no closer, Doctor! FZZZ OF FORCE-FIELD.\nDOCTOR: Argh! [RECOVERING] A force-field, of course. Oooh, that hurt.\nFRATALIN: I did warn you.\nFRATALIN: DALEK COMES TO A HALT.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Shut down the force-field immediately!\nFRATALIN: I will not.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Shut down all defence systems and surrender to the Daleks. This station is under Dalek control.\nDOCTOR: Bit of an exaggeration, isn’t it? There are only three of you so far, and the security systems are affecting your—\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Silence! You will shut down the security systems or I will exterminate the Doctor.\nFRATALIN: Do as you wish. Nothing supersedes the security of this station.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: Oh dear.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 54\nMILA: [A LONG SIGH] Oh come on, Doctor. Where are you? Are you out there?\nMILA: SCANNER OPERATES. WE HEAR THE BACKGROUND SOUND OF THE AMETHYST STATION.\nMILA: SLOWLY, THE SOUND OF A DALEK BEGINS TO FADE IN. [WITH GROWING DREAD] What... ? What’s that?\nDALEK ONE: [DISTORT] Unit One to Dalek Control.\nMILA: Oh, so it’s you lot again!\nDALEK ONE: [DISTORT] I have located the Doctor’s TARDIS.\nMILA: But you won’t find me! You never will! I’m safe with the Doctor. He’ll defeat you! He always has done and he always will!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 55\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Shut down your security system or the Doctor dies!!!\nDOCTOR: Far be it from me to put ideas into your head, but why don’t you just blast the force-field projectors, get into the control centre and shut down the security systems yourself?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. DALEK HEAD WHIRLS AROUND A BIT. Don’t tell me you hadn’t thought of that.\nFRATALIN: Your friend seems somewhat slow-witted, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Once again, Fratalin, the Daleks are not my friends. They are, in fact, my mortal enemies.\nFRATALIN: Then why does this... creature hesitate to kill you?\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I’m not sure. He seems confused.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Dalek time squad leader to Dalek control. Am requesting orders.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 56\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Continue to obey your mission imperatives. The integrity of the station’s viral containment fields must not be endangered. The Doctor must be kept alive as a resource. Find alternative solutions. Use other life-forms.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 57\nDOCTOR: What are they telling you, your friends in ‘Dalek Control’ ?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: I... am... detecting other life-forms in this station.\nDOCTOR: Interesting that you call yourself a ‘ time squad leader’.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: They are of the same species as this creature.\nFRATALIN: You say there are only three of these Daleks, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but don’t underestimate—\nFRATALIN: Then my familiars will overpower them.\nDOCTOR: I only hope you’re right.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Creatures detected, moving in this direction.\nDOCTOR: How many? Let me guess... About seven hundred and ninety- nine? You’ve called them for a mass conjoining, haven’t you, Fratalin? Dire circumstances.\nDOCTOR: THE FOOTSTEPS OF FAMILIAR 354 ARRIVING.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Halt!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: Supervisor Fratalin, what are your orders?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Creature designated as ‘Supervisor Fratalin’! You will shut down the force-field or your fellow creature will be destroyed.\nFRATALIN: 354! Envelop this machine creature!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: Yes, Supervisor!\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS AS IT MOVES FORWARD, SQUELCHING, UNFURLING ITSELF.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Stay back! Do not move! Stay back!\nDOCTOR: I hope this works, Fratalin.\nDOCTOR: A WHOOSH AND SQUELCH AS THE DALEK IS ENVELOPED, AS IF 354 LAUNCHED HIMSELF AT THE DALEK.\nDOCTOR: DALEK IS MOVING BACK AND FORTH, ITS HEAD SPINNING. THE VARIOUS SERVO NOISES ARE MUFFLED BY THE SQUELCHING CREATURE.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: [MUFFLED] Casing enveloped! Casing enveloped! Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUN FIRES. A FIZZ OF ENERGY.\nDOCTOR: FRATALIN FAMILIAR 354: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaargn!\nDOCTOR: A HORRIBLE ‘FRYING OF FAT’ KIND OF SOUND AS THE CHOGROPHIN IS DESTROYED.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: This will be the first of many of your fellow creatures to die, if you do not shut down the force-field! Obey the Daleks!\nFRATALIN: [CLEARLY SHAKEN, IN PAIN] I... I.. will... will not.\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, are you all right?\nFRATALIN: These... creatures truly are your enemies, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 59\nDOCTOR: Truly. And you must tell your familiars not to come here, or this Dalek will surely destroy— [them all]\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Silence, Doctor!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: COMMS BLEEP.\nFRATALIN: Fratalin to all familiars. Mass conjoining is rescinded. Disperse to your duty sectors immediately, there are creatures in this station called Daleks, and they threaten us all!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Time squad leader to units one and two. Cease search for Patient Zero immediately!\nDOCTOR: Patient Zero?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Scan for all life-forms conforming to scan information I am now transmitting. Destroy on sight until further orders.\nDALEKS ONE AND TWO: [DISTORT] We obey!\nDOCTOR: What exactly is Patient Zero?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Fratalin! If you do not shut down the force-field, the creatures you call ‘familiars’ will be tracked down, one by one, and exterminated! Obey my commands and their lives will be spared!\nFRATALIN: I cannot obey your commands! I have committed my whole life, my very being, to my duty in this station! I will not betray the great work we have begun here. There is much more at stake here than my survival. So you must do your worst, Dalek. I will not yield.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: The Daleks have encountered defiance of this nature many times before. It is always been crushed! You will have\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: sacrificed your lives for nothing! The Daleks will be victorious!\nDOCTOR: What’s so precious to you that you’ve travelled in time to get here, and dare not kill me or damage the systems in this station to get it?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Silence, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Or what? What can you possibly threaten me with when you\nDOCTOR: dare not upset the balance of time itself?\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUN FIRES, BUT THE BEAM SOUND ELONGATES AND TURNS INTO A SUSTAINED, PAINFUL WHINING SOUND.\nDOCTOR: [CRIES OUT IN PAIN. HELD IN AGONY]\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You are correct! I have orders to keep you alive! But you feel pain! I can suspend you in torment! TI can... damage you! So, you - will be silent!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: DALEK GUN STOPS FIRING. DOCTOR CRASHES TO THE FLOOR, GASPING IN AGONY.\nFRATALIN: [CONCERNED] Doctor... Doctor, are you all right? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: [GASPING, BARELY ABLE TO SPEAK] Your... your ‘great work’... had better be worth the... carnage that’s about to take place.\nFRATALIN: [A WHISPER] It is. But don’t worry, Doctor, the Viyrans will soon be here. They will put a stop to these... monsters.\nDOCTOR: Viyrans? Who... who are the Viyrans?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Viyrans?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 61\nDALEK DRONE: Destination of Amethyst Station distress signal now located.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Identify.\nDALEK COMMANDER: SCREEN ACTIVATES.\nDALEK DRONE: Observe. A space vessel. Type unknown.\nDALEK DRONE: BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Its course is set to intercept this station.\nDALEK DRONE: Its speed is increasing.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The configuration suggests a powerful enemy. This must be the ‘Viyrans’ to which Fratalin refers. We must complete our mission before these Viyrans arrive. The Daleks must take full control of Amethyst immediately. Continue with the extermination of the Fratalin creatures! The station’s defences must be shut down!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SQUELCHING OF FRATALIN FAMILIAR ATTEMPTING TO ENVELOPE.\nDALEK TWO: Unit two reporting.

They are utterly ruthless. They won’t stop until you give them what they want.\nFRATALIN: I see that, Doctor. I know that. But I cannot give them what they want.\nDOCTOR: What can be worth this much suffering? What is this ‘great work’ you mentioned before. Fratalin?\nFRATALIN: I cannot tell you. I am sworn to secrecy. [SUDDEN GASP IN PAIN] No...\nFRATALIN: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEK BLAST. ‘FRYING’ OF A FRATALIN FAMILIAR.\nFRATALIN FAMILIAR: AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nDALEK ONE: Unit One to control.

What was that?\nCHARLEY: ANOTHER DALEK BLAST, SLIGHTLY CLOSER THIS TIME. Oh no... Oh no... Not them.\nCHARLEY: ANOTHER BLAST FROM A DALEK.\nCHARLEY: Daleks...\nCHARLEY: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 66\nFRATALIN: [GASPS IN PAIN]\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, for pity’s sake, please... Tell me what this ‘great work’ is. I may be able to help.\nFRATALIN: [IN PAIN] It is not your place, Doctor. Not your place. The Viyrans.. the Viyrans will [A GASP OF PAIN. THIS IS TEARING HIM APART]\nDOCTOR: Do you know?!! You! Dalek, I’m talking to you!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You have been warned, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Don’t you see? He’s never going to give in! Fratalin holds a secret that he values more than his life. This\nDOCTOR: mass murder is utterly pointless!\nDOCTOR: DALEK HEAD MOVEMENTS.\nDOCTOR: Oh, why am I even bothering to try to reason with you? You wallow in the blood of innocents just for... what? The\nDOCTOR: glory of it all?!?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: This will be the greatest victory of the Daleks!\nDOCTOR: [SEIZING ON THE NOTION] What will be? What is it you’re trying to achieve here?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR OPENS. A DALEK MOVES THROUGH.\nDALEK ONE: Life-form located. It is humanoid. Identify!\nCHARLEY: Oh... no one in particular. Now, if you don’t mind, I was\nCHARLEY: just having a little sleep, so—\nDALEK ONE: Silence! What action should I take?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 68\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Scan humanoid and relay information to Dalek Control.\nDOCTOR: What humanoid? What have you found?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDALEK ONE: Now scanning.\nDALEK ONE: DALEK SCANNING SOUND.\nDALEK ONE: CROSS-FADE TO...\nDALEK ONE: Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: BURBLE OF SCANNING DATE.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Data is being received.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The data shows antigens associated with Patient Zero.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 71\nDALEK SQUAD COMMANDER: Then this humanoid must have been in contact with Patient Zero.\nDOCTOR: Patient Zero again... Who is Patient Zero?\nDALEK COMMANDER: [DISTORT ] Patient Zero must be here. Our time scans were correct!\nDOCTOR: So that’s why you’re here, to find someone infected with a virus.\nDALEK COMMANDER: [DISTORT] It is imperative that the security systems are shut down so that the search for Patient Zero can continue unimpeded.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: The Fratalin creature will not yield.\nDALEK COMMANDER: [DISTORT] Then threaten the extermination of the humanoid female.\nDOCTOR: [TO HIMSELF ] Female... Oh no...\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] The Doctor has compassion. Our records show that he often travels with a female. This could be the one who travels with him.\nDOCTOR: You sound different, who are you?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] I am the Dalek Time Controller, Doctor. My function is linked to the flow of time and space. I control all strategies in the vortex.\nDOCTOR: [AFFECTING BEING UNIMPRESSED] How nice for you.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] Let the female speak.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nCHARLEY: Sorry, Doctor... It’s me.\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Charley... But I left you in...\nCHARLEY: Not too-—\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] That is enough! Doctor!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: How are you?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 73\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT, CONT’D] Your friend has been in contact with Patient Zero.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] She shows signs of viral infection.\nFRATALIN: It’s true, Doctor. That’s why we put her in containment.\nDOCTOR: You... ? What’s going on here?\nFRATALIN: Her bio-scan showed traces of Virus 7001.\nDOCTOR: 7001... ? Explain to me who this Patient Zero is.\nFRATALIN: I don’t know what they’re talking about. But Patient Zero is a term usually—\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, I’m well aware of what Patient Zero means... the origin of an infection. The first victim of a disease—\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: You must tell us where Patient Zero is.\nDOCTOR: You have to believe me when I Say... I’ve no idea.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: Hello? What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT] The Fratalin creature will shut down the security systems for us to search for Patient Zero. If\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: he does not, the humanoid female will die.\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, please...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 74\nFRATALIN: Doctor... Believe me.. I am truly sorry.\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, sooner or later, the Daleks will find a way to shut down your defences. Eventually they’1ll risk everything and just blast them down. You’re just prolonging the agony.\nDALEK TWO: [DISTORT] More Fratalin creatures located.\nDALEK TWO: DALEK BLAST ON DISTORT. THE ‘FRYING’ OF FAMILIARS.\nFAMILIARS: [DISTORT] Aaaaaaargh!\nFRATALIN: [WINCES IN AGONY] No... [BEGINS TO WEEP]\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Prepare to exterminate the female.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 75\nDALEK ONE: Stand up!\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Doctor, can you hear me?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Doctor?\nDALEK COMMANDER: [DISTORT] Shut down the security system!\nDOCTOR: Can’t you see, Fratalin.. they won’t ever give up.\nFRATALIN: I am sorry for your loss, Doctor. But you must understand that I have no choice.\nDOCTOR: [ALOUD] All right! Listen to me! Daleks! If you don’t harm my friend, I will shut down the force-field for you, then you can get into the Control Centre and shut down whatever systems you like.\nFRATALIN: [APPALLED] Doctor, no!!!\nDOCTOR: Don’t you understand, I can’t let that girl die? I’ve travelled across the entire universe, across aeons to try to save her. I can’t just let her die now. [WHISPERS ] We’1ll find another way to defeat the Daleks—\nFRATALIN: No! You said yourself that they never give up! Doctor, you can’t do this! You must be strong! You must—\nDOCTOR: Then I can’t be that ‘strong’! If that’s what strength is, it’s beyond me! There’s been enough senseless killing here today. Daleks! If I do this, you must cease the extermination of Fratalin’s familiars! You\nDOCTOR: hear me?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 76\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Well?\nDALEK COMMANDER: Can we trust the Doctor?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: He has compassion and he is resourceful. He will do as he says.\nDALEK COMMANDER: We should exterminate him and destroy all the defence systems! Nothing must stand against the Daleks!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: If we destroy the station’s defences, there could be a breach of the containment fields. The viruses could escape and destroy us! I have authority in this strategy! The Doctor will shut down the force-field and allow us access to the control centre. Once our time ship has materialized in the station, all can be exterminated!\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT] Come on! What’s your decision?! I have one condition, by the way.\nDOCTOR: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: No conditions, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [DISTORT]\nDOCTOR: I want to see Charley... the female! Take me to her. I want to see with my own eyes that she’s still alive and unharmed.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. You could be playing me a recording of her! You could’ve\nDOCTOR: already killed her! I want to see her before I... betray everything.\nDOCTOR: LONG PAUSE.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Very well.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: AN ALMIGHTY CRASH OF MUSIC. IT FADES SLOWLY. SOME TIME PASSES.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: DISTORT/ON SCREEN SOUND OF DALEK APPROACHING.\nMILA: Another Dalek? What are they up to now?\nMILA: FOOTSTEPS ON SCREEN.\nMILA: [DELIGHTED] Doctor! It’s the Doctor! [LAUGHS] Oh, you may have got him prisoner now... but he’1ll defeat you. He always does.\nMILA: THE DALEK SOUND AND FOOTSTEPS HAVE RECEDED ON THE SCREEN.\nMILA: And then I’1l be by his side... Yes.. I can help. Yes! I’m going to help you, Doctor.\nMILA: DOOR CONTROL OPERATED. FOOTSTEPS AS SHE RUNS OUT OF THE TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: [DASHES TO HER] Charley? Charley, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: THE CONVERSATION IS AT SOTTO LEVEL.\nCHARLEY: No.. I feel awful... but it’s nothing the Daleks have done. What is this place?\nDOCTOR: It’s where I think your virus came from.\nCHARLEY: Here? Why? How?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea at the moment, but the Daleks clearly know about the viruses here, and they’re trying to find someone they call-—\nDALEK SQUAD COMMANDER: That is enough! Silence! You have seen that the female is alive! You will now co-operate and shut down the force-field! Move!\nDOCTOR: Very well. [MOVING OFF] Everything’s going to be all right, Charley. Just... just hang on.\nCHARLEY: But, Doctor, I haven’t told you everything. There was this—\nDALEK SQUAD COMMANDER: Silence! Move, Doctor! Now! [TO DALEK ONE] Remain here and guard her.\nDALEK ONE: I obey.\nDALEK ONE: THE DALEK MOVES OFF QUICKLY, WITH THE DOCTOR’S FOOTSTEPS. DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES.\nCHARLEY: But Doctor! Doctor! There was this... girl... [DELFATED] in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDALEK ONE: You will remain silent.\nCHARLEY: Or maybe I really did just imagine her...\nDALEK ONE: Silence!\nCHARLEY: Were you real... Mila?\nDALEK ONE: What did you say?\nCHARLEY: What?\nDALEK ONE: Repeat it! Repeat that name!\nDALEK ONE: Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 81\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Mila. I said... Mila.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Patient Zero! She knows of Patient Zero!\nDALEK COMMANDER: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Interrogate her!\nDALEK ONE: [DISTORT] I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 82\nDALEK ONE: Where did you encounter Mila?\nCHARLEY: What? Why do you want to know?\nDALEK ONE: Answer!\nCHARLEY: You know who Mila is? [THINKING] She said she’d escaped from the Daleks...\nDALEK ONE: Answer or you will be exterminated!\nCHARLEY: But you promised the Doctor that—\nDALEK ONE: It was expedient! Patient Zero overrides all other imperatives!\nCHARLEY: Patient—?\nDALEK ONE: Where is Mila?!!\nCHARLEY: Well... the last time I saw... thought I saw her... Oh, this is ridiculous, I was delirious. I’m ill!\nDALEK ONE: Answer now!\nCHARLEY: She was in the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 83\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The TARDIS is outside the influence of the station’s security defences. Scan the TARDIS immediately!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: SCANNING OPERATES. AFTER A MOMENT, A BLEEPING INDICATOR KICKS IN.\nDALEK DRONE: TARDIS defences penetrated by scanners.\nDALEK DRONE: BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Where is Patient Zero?\nDALEK COMMANDER: BURBLE OF READ-OUT.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Find her! Find her noooowwww! !!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: SLOW BLEEPING, LIKE SONAR, OF SOMETHING LOCATED.\nDALEK DRONE: There is a DNA trace, but nothing substantial.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: She was in the TARDIS, but now she has left. She must be in the station!\nDALEK COMMANDER: Units one and two will search immediately!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 84\nDALEK ONE: I obey.\nDALEK ONE: DALEK MOVES OFF THROUGH THE DOOR.\nCHARLEY: Where are you off to? I thought you wanted to exterminate me?!\nCHARLEY: DOOR CLOSES.\nCHARLEY: [ALONE] Not that I’m complaining.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 85\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: What is the Doctor’s progress with the force-field?\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: [DISTORT] Proceeding.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SOUND OF CONTROLS BEING PULLED APART. TINKERING WITH ELECTRONICS.\nFRATALIN: Doctor, I’m begging you, please. Don’t do this.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Fratalin, but I must. That girl’s been an enigma to me far too long. And when it comes to defeating the Daleks, I never give up hope.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: There is no hope! You will obey! The Daleks will be victorious! That is all!\nDOCTOR: But sometimes, their certainty is something you can use against them.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Stop talking and deactivate the force-field!\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, I’m going as fast as I can. This is very tricky work, you know. Not the sort of thing you can solve with a plunger.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR OPENS. FOOTSTEPS AS MILA ENTERS. HER VOICE IS TOTALLY CLEAR NOW.\nMILA: Ah, there you are, Charley.\nCHARLEY: [GROGGY] Who... ? You?\nMILA: [WITH A SMILE] Still feeling awful, are you?\nCHARLEY: But I thought...\nMILA: [IMPERSONATING HER] ‘But I thought... ’ What did you think, Charley? That I’d deserted you? That I didn’t really love you?\nCHARLEY: Your face. It’s clearer now. There’s something familiar about it.\nMILA: [KNOWING] Is there? Have you seen the Doctor?\nCHARLEY: Yes... Those are my clothes, you’re wearing.\nMILA: Are they?\nCHARLEY: And... your hair...\nMILA: Do you like it? You should. It’s the way you’re wearing yours. Not quite so sweaty, of course, but then, I’m not ill any more.\nCHARLEY: Any more...? Ooooh [FEELING NAUSEOUS] What... what’s happening?\nCHARLEY: THE EBBING AND FLOWING SOUND. CHARLEY’S VOICE FADES IN AND OUT.\nCHARLEY: [DISTANT ECHO ON HER VOICE] What’s going on? Mila! Are\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: you doing this to me?\nMILA: [LAUGHS, DELIGHTED] Oh Charley. It’s nearly time for you to go.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 89\nDOCTOR: Ah, got it!\nDOCTOR: A BUZZ OF SOMETHING DISCONNECTING. THE FORCE-FIELD HUM WINDS DOWN VERY LOW.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Is the force-field deactivated?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and I shall demonstrate.\nDOCTOR: TAKES A FEW STEPS, TO THE OTHER SIDE OF WHERE THE FORCE- FIELD WAS.\nDOCTOR: There... you see. I’m able to pass through the doorway, unimpeded! Please, no applause.\nFRATALIN: Doctor, what have you done?\nFRATALIN: SOUND OF DALEK ADVANCING.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Reporting to control. The Doctor has deactivated the force-field. Am now proceeding to locate and deactivate all security system controls. If necessary, I will force the Doctor to assist me.\nDOCTOR: Now that wasn’t part of the bargain.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: You will obey—\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: FIZZ AS THE FORCE-FIELD CATCHES THE DALEK.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Aaaargh! Assist! Assist! Am caught in force-field energy discharge! Systems malfunctioning!\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. What a pity!\nFRATALIN: Then you... you didn’t deactivate it? You were lying to them?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 90\nDOCTOR: Strictly, no. [TO DALEK] Hmmm. It seems it will only let in organic creatures. Don’t fancy popping out of\nDOCTOR: your casing and slithering through do you? DALEK REVERSES. FORCE-FIELD FIZZING STOPS.\nDALEK SQUAD COMMANDER: [FURIOUS] Reporting to control! The Doctor has tricked us! The force-field allows organic creatures to pass through it, but prevents Dalek entry.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 91\nDALEK COMMANDER: Order unit one to proceed to Containment area immediately and exterminate the Doctor’s companion!\nDALEK COMMANDER: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 92\nDOCTOR: Yes, what? [SOTTO] Fratalin, I need your help.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [DISTORT]\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: You have one last chance to save your companion’s life. Fully deactivate the force-field immediately, or she will die.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Fratalin...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: CHARLEY’S VOICE HAS BECOME JUST A TINY BIT FUZZY.\nMILA: Come on, try it.\nCHARLEY: Don’t be ridiculous. I can’t fit through these bars.\nMILA: [ENTICING] It wouldn’t hurt to try, though, would it? Would it?\nMILA: A FEW FOOTSTEPS. THE EBBING AND THROWING SOUND.\nCHARLEY: Oh my goodness.\nCHARLEY: FOOTSTEPS.\nCHARLEY: I just... But... how is that possible? I can’t just walk through solid bars.\nMILA: You’d be amazed what you can do now... seriously.\nMILA: DOOR OPENS. DALEK APPROACHING.\nCHARLEY: Look out!\nDALEK ONE: Stay where you are! You will be exterminated!\nCHARLEY: No!\nCHARLEY: A QUICKER VERSION OF THE EBBING AND FLOWING SOUND. LIKE A WOBBLE OF REALITY.\nCHARLEY: What? But... that Dalek just went straight through me.\nDALEK ONE: The Doctor has tricked us! You will be exterminated!\nMILA: [QUITE PROUD] Who me?\nCHARLEY: It.. it thinks you’re me? It can’t see me at all.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 94\nDALEK ONE: Exterminate!\nMILA: Oh well, if you must.\nMILA: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 95"

There must be a force- field or something we can activate to prevent a Dalek getting access to that containment area!\nFRATALIN: No, Doctor. The containment area is sealed by airlock doors.

I’ve gambled with her life... and lost.\nFRATALIN: She is to you almost as the Familiars are to me?\nDOCTOR: What? No, that’s the terrible thing. I hardly know her at all.

You don’t belong out here.\nCHARLEY: What am I supposed to do in the TARDIS?\nMILA: What I did. Be ignored.\nCHARLEY: You mean... you were there all that time, and no one saw you?\nMILA: No one until you.\nCHARLEY: Why me?\nMILA: I told you! Because of the TARDIS! It didn’t like you. Didn’t protect you. So I could pass the virus to you.\nCHARLEY: All right! I sort of understand that... sort of.. But what kind of virus is it? Where did you pick it up? What does it do?\nMILA: I was being experimented on.\nCHARLEY: You said you were on a Dalek ship. You were being experimented on by the Daleks?\nMILA: Yes, by the Daleks! Honestly, you’re so slow! They were experimenting on me with a virus that was supposed to change what you were.\nCHARLEY: ‘Change what you were’?\nMILA: Yes... like, if you caught it... your DNA would mutate into a copy of the DNA of whoever you caught it off.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: And why were the Daleks experimenting with that?\nMILA: To try to turn people into Daleks! Isn’t it obvious?\nMILA: But the trouble was that the mutation was so violent, it killed the infected person, and they didn’t want that. They wanted the mutated person to survive, so that they would actually become a part of the Dalek army. They used to say that their plan was for every creature in the universe to become a Dalek.\nCHARLEY: That sounds like the Daleks all right.\nMILA: [A BAD MEMORY] But something went wrong. [BEAT ] Have you ever felt certain you were going to die?\nCHARLEY: Yes, but.. [TRAILS OFF]\nMILA: But what?\nCHARLEY: But... with the Doctor, there’s always a glimmer of hope... Even in the most awful of circumstances.\nMILA: I had no hope. I had no Doctor. They just used me, like bacteria in a test tube or something. I knew they\nMILA: wouldn’t stop... until I was dead... or worse.\nCHARLEY: Worse?\nMILA: Being a Dalek is worse than being dead, wouldn’t you say?\nMILA: FADE IN NIGHTMARISH SOUNDS OF DALEKS, ECHOING UNDER MILA’S WORDS. OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF INDISTINCT DALEK DIALOGUE. WE’RE MOVING TOWARDS HER POINT OF VIEW...\nCHARLEY: Yes. I think you’re probably right. Is that what they tried to do to you?\nMILA: They were using me as a guinea-pig to test the virus on. They thought, if they could get me to infect other creatures and turn them into copies of me... copies that\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: survived.. then it would be safe to inject the virus into a Dalek.\nCHARLEY: And did the virus work on you? Did you infect other people and—-?\nMILA: And they turned into copies of me. Yes. And they survived. The Daleks must’ve thought, ‘Right, it’s working now’. So they injected a Dalek with the virus.\nMILA: I was meant to catch the virus off the Dalek. Turn into a Dalek. [BEAT] But... maybe the virus kept mutating... I don’t know. But the Dalek test subject died. [BEAT ] They were really angry. Like it was my fault. They started bombarding me with... I don’t know... radiation? Energy? Whatever it was, they blasted me with it... again and again and again... Each time like being slammed into a wall so hard that finally, I couldn’t even remember who I was. It went on for what felt like days... maybe longer.\nMILA: I don’t know. I remember the light... blinding and burning... but so cold. Freezing to the core of me. But what I remember most is... [SHE TRAILS OFF]\nCHARLEY: [GENTLY] Mila?\nMILA: Wanting to die.\nMILA: PAUSE.\nMILA: And then... something happened. They started screaming and shouting, as they always did... And there was pain. Pain like you wouldn’t believe... Like you never forget. I didn’t even know what was going on.\nMILA: CROSS-FADE TO FLASHBACK OF MILA’S EXPERIENCES.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 104 64. MILA’S FLASHBACK. DALEK RESEARCH VESSEL.\nDOCTOR WHO: ALARMS SOUNDING.\nDALEK TANNOY: [DISTORT, ECHOING IN BACKGROUND]\nDALEK TANNOY: Cellular mutation alert! Cellular mutation alert!\nDALEK SCIENTIST: Patient Zero’s molecular structure is phasing with reality! Stabilize power from warp reactor!\nDALEK SCIENCE DRONE: Fluctuations in warp reactor field are causing dimensional fusing with Patient Zero’s DNA.\nDALEK SCIENTIST: Shut down hyperdrive immediately! Patient Zero is phasing into another dimension!\nDALEK SCIENTIST: THE EBBING AND FLOWING SOUND.\nMILA: [FROM BEHIND GLASS]\nMILA: What’s happening to me? Nooooo! [HER VOICE ECHOES INTO\nMILA: NOTHING]\nDALEK SCIENTIST: Where is Patient Zero? I cannot see her!\nDALEK SCIENCE DRONE: She is not registering on perceptors!\nDALEK SCIENTIST: Where is she???\nDALEK SCIENTIST: CUT BACK TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 105\nCHARLEY: So.. that’s how you hid from the Daleks. They couldn’t see you. And... when you came into the TARDIS... [REALIZING] The Doctor’s never seen you, has he? And everybody who’s travelled with him all these years... None of them has ever seen you, have they?\nMILA: But that’s going to change... and all because of you, Charlotte Pollard.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: COMPUTER READOUTS BURBLE.\nFRATALIN: Doctor, please—\nDOCTOR: I know, I know, it’s all top secret.\nDOCTOR: MORE COMPUTER READ-OUTS.\nDOCTOR: [LOOKING AT SCREEN] What are these? Ah! These are the containment areas for the viruses, aren’t they? This station is full of viruses... must be literally millions of them here. But why? Something to do with these Viyran creatures you mentioned? And why are the Daleks here?\nDOCTOR: To take the viruses? They have a penchant for biological warfare. And who is Patient Zero? Feel free to answer any time you like.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: URGENT BLEEPING OF SCANNERS.\nDALEK DRONE: Approaching space ship has increased speed.\nDALEK COMMANDER: We cannot wait any longer! We must risk destroying the station’s security systems! Now!\nDALEK COMMANDER: SOUND OF THE DALEK MOVING AND SWIVELLING EYE STALK. Time Controller! We must act immediately!\nDALEK COMMANDER: PAUSE.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Very well. Give the order for the Time Squad Leader to destroy the force-field projectors.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Begin destruction of force-field projectors!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: [DISTORT] I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEK GUN FIRES A SUSTAINED BURST. SPARKS SHOWER ON IMPACT.\nDOCTOR: Right, that’s it, Fratalin! We’re officially out of time. You’ve got to tell me the purpose of this station! It’s the only way I can help.\nFRATALIN: There will be no need for your help, the Viyrans willl... Soon, the Viyrans will... [HE CANNOT SAY]\nDOCTOR: Will what? What do the Viyrans want, Fratalin?\nDOCTOR: CROSS-FADE TO DALEK BEAM BURNING OUT FORCE-FIELD PROJECTOR. SPARKS SHOWERING.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: CHARLEY’S VOICE IS BECOMING VERY FUZZY NOW.\nMILA: You see, all that experimenting the Daleks had done... all that radiation or whatever it was... and the dimensional shifting... I don’t pretend to understand it, but it changed me. All I could remember was my name... Mila... I didn’t know anything else.\nCHARLEY: That’s horrible. I’m sure the Doctor could help if we—\nMILA: But don’t you see, Charley, I’m going to the Doctor now. Me. And he won’t be able to see you any more.\nCHARLEY: What are you saying?\nMILA: But he’ll be able to see me. Do you see me? Are you looking at me? Can you see me?\nCHARLEY: You... you’ re...\nMILA: I’m you, now, Charley. You see, I found, after so many years, I could control the virus. If I tried hard\nMILA: enough, I could let it out a bit at a time and, maybe, even kill a Dalek now and again.\nCHARLEY: What? But—\nMILA: Or, in your case, with you unprotected by the TARDIS, I gave you the virus. But then, with the TARDIS stopping you from passing it on to anyone but me... You re-infected me. And while I’ve changed into you, you’ve started to change into...\nCHARLEY: You? You mean—?\nMILA: [VOICE CROSS-FADES INTO MILA/CHARLEY]\nMILA: It’s so perfect. That’s why I love you, Charlotte Pollard. Because I am you now. I’ve been watching you so closely. I know everything I need to know about you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 110\nCHARLEY: [VERY FUZZY NOW] You don’t know the truth! You can’t know the truth!\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : Who needs the whole truth? I can make up my own truth, tell the Doctor what he wants to hear.\nCHARLEY: But what’s going to happen to me?\nCHARLEY: PAUSE. MILA/CHARLEY : I’m sorry... I didn’t quite hear that. You’1l have to\nCHARLEY: speak up.\nCHARLEY: I said what’s going to happen to me?!?\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : No. [BEAT] I can’t hear you any more. [In fact... why am I standing here, talking to myself. [LAUGHS] I must be\nCHARLEY: going mad.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 111\nDALEK COMMANDER: Has the force-field been destroyed yet?\nDALEK DRONE: Readings indicate force-field integrity is near point of collapse.\nDALEK DRONE: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Dalek Control to Time Squad Leader, increase your firepower!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEK BEAM IS STILL BURNING AWAY AT FORCE FIELD PROJECTORS.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Firepower already at maximum!\nDOCTOR: [TRYING TO BE CALM] Look, Fratalin, as far as I can tell, this is probably the biggest stockpile of viruses in the entire universe. If the Daleks get hold of it, they are going to make life intolerable for every living creature in existence. Do you really want that?\nFRATALIN: [LOSING HIS TEMPER] But how can you stop it, Doctor? Is this your ‘stupid over-confidence’ again? The whole purpose of this station is... is to.. [STOPPING HIMSELF]\nDOCTOR: Is to what? Tell me!\nFRATALIN: [AND FINALLY...] To prevent the kind of catastrophe you’re talking about! To prevent the use of biological weapons forever! I’ve said too much.\nDOCTOR: [WORKING IT OUT] These Viyrans... they’ re coming to take the viruses away, aren’t they? To destroy them? And you said something about an Armistice Treaty. There’s been a war, hasn’t there?\nFRATALIN: [HEAVY SIGH] There was a war. Long ago. A biological war. It nearly wiped out this whole galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Who are the Viyrans? What are they?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : [OFF TO ONE SIDE, DISTANT] Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [TO HIMSELF] Charley? [ALOUD, DUMBFOUNDED] Charley! But you— Get back!\nDOCTOR: DALEK BLASTING CONTINUES.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: Humanoid female! Remain where you are!\nDOCTOR: Charley, get back to the TARDIS as fast as you can! That Dalek is about to finish blasting out the force-field protecting us in here!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: I’m not leaving you!\nDOCTOR: It issued orders to kill you! The moment it’s finished—\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY’S FOOTSTEPS RUNNING. Charley, no! What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : [EFFORT, AS SHE COLLIDES WITH DALEK AND GRABS IT]\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Humanoid female will remove herself from my casing immediately!\nFRATALIN: It will kill her.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY : [A GROWL OF EFFORT, AS SHE PUSHES THE DALEK]\nDOCTOR: Charley, no!!!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: Assist! Assist!\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: WHOOSH OF SPARKS AS PROJECTORS EXPLODE, HISS OF GUSHING SMOKE/VAPOUR. WHIZZ OF DALEK AS IT IS PROPELLED INTO THE FORCE-FIELD UNIT.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: MILA/CHARLEY: [CLOSE, TO HERSELF] Just... one more time. Come on...\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: [STRANGULATED NOISES] No! Systems failure, I cannot... cannot... !!!\nFRATALIN: Doctor, what’s she doing to it?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: I can’t see, there’s too much smoke. HUGE METALLIC CRUNCH AS THE DALEK CRASHES INTO THE WALL.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: [WINDING DOWN] Cannot... cannot... aaaaaaargh. [IT DIES]\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: PAUSE. NOTHING BUT THE INTERMITTENT FIZZING OF THE DESTROYED FORCE-FIELD PROJECTORS.\nDALEK SQUAD LEADER: FOOTSTEPS AS DOCTOR APPROACHES.\nDOCTOR: Charley? Charley, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [GASPING, EXHAUSTED] Er... yes... I think So...\nFRATALIN: What did you do to it?\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Just pushed it into that control panel thing. Who are you?\nFRATALIN: I am Fratalin, the Supervisor of this station.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Pleased to meet you. [SAVOURING THE MOMENT] I am Charlotte Pollard.\nDOCTOR: You took a terrible risk, Charlotte. It could’ve killed you.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I didn’t think. I just knew I had to save you—\nDOCTOR: Did you now? Well... I didn’t chase round the universe to find a way of curing you, just to see you take stupid risks! ‘Stupid’? What am I talking about? Suicidal risks!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I’m sorry, Doctor. I really am.\nDOCTOR: Well... good... mmm. Anyway... How are you feeling?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: Much better, thank you. That containment area they had me in must have done the trick.\nFRATALIN: Done the trick? The purpose of a containment area is simply—\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Is... the Dalek dead?\nDOCTOR: Yes... yes it is.\nDOCTOR: SOUND OF DALEK HEAD BEING LIFELESSLY SWIVELLED. It’s completely shut down. Dead. You were very lucky.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: I think we all were... as it turns out. [PLAYFUL LAUGH]\nDOCTOR: Hmmm, and you’ve still got some explaining—\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Oh don’t worry, Doctor. I’11 tell you everything now.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Everything I haven’t been telling you. You see—\nDOCTOR: CONTROLS BEING OPERATED.\nFRATALIN: Doctor... that explosion, it’s shut down the whole security system.\nDOCTOR: That leaves this entire station open to Dalek attack. If they’re in a time ship, they’1ll be able to materialize... well, anywhere they... [HE STOPS, LISTENING]\nDOCTOR: THE BEGINNING OF DALEK TIME SHIP MATERIALIZATION HAS FADED IN.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: What’s that sound? Is it the Daleks?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: Yes, come on, the only safe place is the TARDIS!\nFRATALIN: I cannot desert the control centre, my duty is—\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, surely your duty is to survive in order to carry out your duty! There’s nothing you can do here...\nDOCTOR: except get yourself killed! Now, please! You’ve got to\nDOCTOR: help us get back to the TARDIS in one of your shuttle-\nDOCTOR: trains. We can wait in there until your Viyrans turn up.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Viyrans? Who are they?\nDOCTOR: Who indeed... Well, Fratalin?\nFRATALIN: Very well.\nDOCTOR: Good, come on!\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS AS THEY DASH OFF. DALEK TIME SHIP MATERIALIZATION IS WELL ADVANCED NOW.\nCHARLEY: [FUZZY AND CUTTING IN AND OUT] Doctor! Doctor! It’s me! Charley! Doctor!!!\nCHARLEY: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDALEK DRONE: Co-ordinates locked. Materialization\nDALEK COMMANDER: Prepare to exterminate all aliens!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The Doctor must not be harmed. We do function in the timeline. He must be interrogation.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: MATERIALIZATION COMPLETES.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Prepare to disembark!\nDALEK COMMANDER: CUT TO...\nDALEK COMMANDER: Page 117\nDALEK COMMANDER: now completing.\nDALEK COMMANDER: not know his captured for\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: CROSS-FADE FROM EXTERIOR OF TRAIN WHOOSHING PAST...\nDOCTOR: So how do these Viyrans intend to destroy the viruses?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, don’t you want to know about me and—?\nDOCTOR: Just a moment, Charlotte - that can wait.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: But—?\nDOCTOR: Fratalin?\nFRATALIN: Very well. I will tell you this... The Viyrans were charged with the task of taking all captured viruses and destroying them in the heart of Amethustra.\nDOCTOR: Amethustra? What’s that?\nFRATALIN: Amethyst’s sun. It was calculated that the unique destructive power of Amethustra was the only sure way of\nFRATALIN: destroying the viruses completely.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY : And who exactly are the Viyrans?\nFRATALIN: That I will never tell you.\nFRATALIN: THE TRAIN SUDDENLY SLOWS DOWN. We’re arriving.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEKS CIRCLING AROUND EACH OTHER.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Report!\nDALEK DRONE: Station Control Centre secured. Dalek Time Squad leader has been destroyed. Squad unit 2 has located unit 1. Unit 1 has also been destroyed.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Cause of destruction?\nDALEK DRONE: Both were destroyed by viral degeneration of cellular structure.\nDALEK DRONE: SOUND OF DALEK TIME CONTROLLER APPROACHING.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The same cause of death as recorded at the time of Patient Zero’s escape.\nDALEK DRONE: There are only residual traces of Patient Zero. She cannot be located.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Intensify the search immediately! Deploy search patrols throughout the station.\nDALEK DRONE: [AS IT MOVES OFF] I obey.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Time transfer generators are now being positioned. Soon we will be able to begin our work! Then Dalek victory over the entire universe will be assured!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND MILA/CHARLEY. PADDING ALONG OF FRATALIN.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the TARDIS is definitely this way. I remember this...\nFRATALIN: Your craft should be three junctions from here.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY : Doctor, I’m sorry I wasn’t more honest with you earlier.\nDOCTOR: ‘More honest’? You’re either honest or you’re not, Charlotte. Which is it to be?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Honest.\nDOCTOR: Very well.. And not before time—[SUDDENLY HEARING SOMETHING] Sssh!\nFRATALIN: [WHISPER] Daleks!\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: But—\nDOCTOR: [WHISPER] Back everyone and keep very still.\nDOCTOR: THE DISTANT SOUND OF DALEKS MOVING.\nDOCTOR: DALEK 1: [IN DISTANCE] Device now in position. Activate!\nDOCTOR: A WHIRRING SOUND.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] I wonder what they’re up to.\nDOCTOR: DISTANT SOUND OF DALEKS MOVING AWAY.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Shall we take a look?\nDOCTOR: TENTATIVE FOOTSTEPS AND PADDING AS THEY APPROACH THE WHIRRING MACHINE. THE WHIRRING GETS LOUDER AS WE APPROACH WITH THEM.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 121\nFRATALIN: What is this device? They’ve attached it to the station’s power conduits. Why?\nDOCTOR: Definitely a piece of Dalek technology... so nothing good will come of it. [EXAMINING IT] Hmmm...\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: It looks like... [MAKING A BIT OF A POINT OF ‘ACCIDENTALLY’ GIVING SOMETHING AWAY] Oh... it doesn’t matter.\nDOCTOR: What doesn’t matter? Of course it matters if you know something about this machine. Come on, out with it, Charlotte.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: Well... this is what I’ve been scared of telling you all along.\nFRATALIN: You singulars are most strange. You really do have secrets from each other? How can that be, Doctor, when there is such a bond between you; when you were so upset that she might be dead?\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: [TOUCHED] Doctor, you-?\nDOCTOR: [ AWKWARD ] I thought... I thought—well, never mind what I thought. What is it you’ve been scared of telling me, and what’s it got to do with this Dalek machine?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [DEEP BREATH] Well... I’ve seen something very like it before.\nDOCTOR: Where?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: On board a Dalek time ship.\nDOCTOR: You've... been on board a—? MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: I was a prisoner of the Daleks. But I managed to escape.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: That’s how I ended up on Earth in the future, where you found me. And I knew who you were, because the Daleks have records of you... and I managed to access those records.\nDOCTOR: You managed to... ? How?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY :\nDOCTOR: I was trapped on one of their space ships. After I’d escaped, I hid inside their communications system. I hacked into their main computer for a while. It’s true.\nDOCTOR: [DUBIOUS] And this was before you managed to stowaway in a Dalek Time ship, was it?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I thought I was going to die there... I’d given up... but then I saw my chance.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, we’ll go into that later. What do you think this device is?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY :\nDOCTOR: Something to do with time travel. I think it’s some kind of generator. What? Why are you looking at me like that?\nDOCTOR: Because you’re absolutely right. This is a Dalek time transfer generator. They use them to expand the time shift field of their ships.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: So... you believe me?\nDOCTOR: Why did you keep this from me?\nCHARLEY: [ALMOST INAUDIBLE, LIKE AN OLD RADIO SIGNAL] Doctor...\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : Because... well, I know you’re the greatest enemy of the Daleks. I was wary of mentioning them to you. I\nCHARLEY: thought... I don’t know, I thought you might have thought I was working for them... or something.\nCHARLEY: [ALMOST INAUDIBLE, LIKE AN OLD RADIO SIGNAL]\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You did claim to be working for them when we encountered that Thal-Dalek Brotherhood. You’re lucky they didn’t recognize you.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I think we were in the wrong time period for that.\nFRATALIN: Isn’t it more important to find out why the Daleks have put this machine here?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I know why they’ve put it here. And I’11 laid odds they’ re placing other time transfer generators throughout Amethyst.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR OPENS. DALEK ENTERS.\nDALEK COMMANDER: [ENTERING] Report!\nDALEK DRONE: Alien vessel is approaching this planet at increasing speed. At current speed, it will arrive in orbit in 582 rels.\nDALEK COMMANDER: What is the status of the time transfer generators?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: All generators have been attached to power conduits. Power network will reach optimum level in 500 rels. Has Patient Zero been located?\nDALEK COMMANDER: Search patrols are moving through the station, but the area is too large. Only 2% of the station has been covered.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: What of the Doctor?\nDALEK COMMANDER: His TARDIS is now guarded. If he should attempt to return to it, he will be captured.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: THE THREE OF THEM ARE MOVING ALONG THE CORRIDOR AT A FAST PACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: So the Daleks want to take this entire station with them when they dematerialize their ship?\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nFRATALIN: And use the viruses for their own ends. I cannot allow that.\nDOCTOR: You can’t allow it? JI can’t allow it.\nFRATALIN: The Viyrans will stop them.\nDOCTOR: I admire your faith.\nCHARLEY: [ALMOST INAUDIBLE, LIKE AN OLD RADIO SIGNAL] Doctor... please, listen to me! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Did anyone hear something just then?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : No.\nFRATALIN: No. But I sense... some of my familiars are not far from here.\nCHARLEY: [ALMOST INAUDIBLE, LIKE AN OLD RADIO SIGNAL] Doctor, there are Daleks ahead of you.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Familiars?\nDOCTOR: Fratalin is plural rather than singular, Charlotte.\nCHARLEY: [ALMOST INAUDIBLE, LIKE AN OLD RADIO SIGNAL] Doctor, they’re watching the TARDIS, you’ll be walking into— [a trap]\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 126\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: What?\nDOCTOR: I.. for a moment, I thought I sensed— Anyway, come on, the TARDIS is just up here, I believe. Yes, look, there she is.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS INCREASE IN SPEED AS THEY RUN FORWARD. IMMEDIATELY, DALEKS MOVE IN TOWARDS THEM.\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 1: Halt!\nFRATALIN: Doctor! Look out!\nFRATALIN: DALEK GUARD 1: Do not move!\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY : [BEING PRODDED] Argh! Get off me!\nFRATALIN: DALEK GUARD 2: You are our prisoners!\nDOCTOR: How tediously predictable. And what are you going to do with us? Please feel free to surprise me.\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 1: You are to be interrogated, Doctor. These other creatures will be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: No! Charley, Fratalin, run!!!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUN FIRES. IMPACTS. RUNNING FOOTSTEPS OF CHARLEY AND FRATALIN.\nDOCTOR: VOCAL REACTIONS FROM MILA/CHARLEY AND FRATALIN AS THEY DIVE OUT THE WAY OF THE BLASTS.\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 2: Destroy them!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: BOTH DALEKS FIRE AGAIN.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: Fratalin!\nDOCTOR: If you harm them, I will not co-operate!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 1: We will force you to co-operate!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 2: Alert! Alert! Additional creatures detected!\nFRATALIN FAMILIARS: [TEN OF THEM] Supervisor!\nFRATALIN FAMILIARS: MILA/CHARLEY : I see what you meant by plural!\nFRATALIN: Quickly, my familiars, conjoin! We must become one!\nFRATALIN: A FAST, SQUELCHING SOUND AS THEY JOIN TOGETHER.\nFRATALIN: DALEK GUARD 1: Destroy them! Destroy them all! Exterminaaaaa...\nFRATALIN: BUT THE DALEK IS MUFFLED AND OVERPOWERED BY A MASS OF SQUELCHING.\nDOCTOR: It’s working, he’s overpowering—!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Watch out, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUARD 2: Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: DALEK GUN FIRES.\nDOCTOR: FIZZ AND FRYING SOUND AS PART OF THE CONJOINED FRATALIN IS HIT.\nFRATALIN FAMILIAR: Aaaaaargh!\nFRATALINS: [A MASS OF TEN OF THEM] No! You will kill no more of us!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: AN OVERWHELMING GUSH OF SQUELCHING AS DALEK 2 IS OVERWHELMED TOO.\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEK GUARD 2: [BEING SMOTHERED] Vision impaired! I cannot see! Casing power overload! Aaaaaaaaargh!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DALEK COMES TO A HALT. SQUELCHING AS THE FRATALIN MASS WITHDRAWS.\nDOCTOR: Fratalin, are you all right?\nFRATALINS: They killed one of us, but we are still conjoined.\nFRATALINS: MILA/CHARLEY: Are those Daleks actually dead?\nFRATALINS: DALEK GUARD 1: [A MURMUR] EXXX... CeCerrrr...\nFRATALINS: MILA/CHARLEY : Ah, apparently not.\nDOCTOR: I feared as much. Short-term casing damage... they’1ll be self-repairing. It’s not safe to be around them, we must\nDOCTOR: get into the TARDIS. A MASSIVE ALARM SOUNDS. A DEEP, DISTURBING HOWL.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: What does that mean? Is it the Daleks?\nFRATALINS: No. Not the Daleks.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: MUFFLED SOUND OF THE BIG ALARM.\nDALEK DRONE: Alert, alien space craft has accelerated. It is now docking with this station.\nDALEK COMMANDER: All Daleks to defensive positions. Prepare to activate time shift generators.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Optimum power levels have not yet been reached.

It’s the only safe place to be.\nFRATALINS: No, Doctor, we must greet the Viyrans. It is our duty. And on the way, I will conjoin with as many of my familiars as possible.\nFRATALINS: MILA/CHARLEY: So you can smother more Daleks?\nFRATALINS: If necessary, yes.

Are you seriously saying I should let the Daleks win?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: You came here to cure me of that virus. And that’s what’s happened. You’ve achieved your purpose. Does any of the other stuff have anything to do with you?\nDOCTOR: Are you sure you’re not working for the Daleks?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Look, Fratalin and these Viyrans are clearly going to deal with the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Are they, indeed?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: Doctor, I’m sorry... but, you see, the reason I’m here, the reason I stowed away on a Dalek time ship and then sent out that signal was because... well, I’d come to admire you.\nDOCTOR: How, precisely?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: From all that information I’d read about you, in the Dalek data files. [DETERMINED TO PROVE IT] Your defeat of their invasion of Earth. Their Time Destructor plan on Kembel. The Daleks who tried to take over that colony on Vulcan... and the way they tricked you into creating the Dalek Factor on Skaro—\nDOCTOR: [GOBSMACKED] You really did do your homework, didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: You were my hope!

Well... I’ve been watching you a lot... since I’ve been in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Really? As a matter of fact, I am detecting the energy Signatures of those Dalek generators. And by the way, don’t think your ‘admiration’ for me has obviated the central question.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: What central question?\nDOCTOR: Oooh, just a little matter, of course. But, who are you, Charlotte Pollard?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I’ve told you. I was a prisoner—\nDOCTOR: No, that’s what you are. I understand that. And I may even believe you. But you still haven’t told me where you’re from, how you came to be a prisoner of the Daleks...?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Oh.\nDOCTOR: Yes... ‘oh’. Well?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Well that’s the thing, you see.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 139\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s the thing, is it?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Yes.. well. You see. I really don’t remember.\nDOCTOR: That’s.. what you’ve said all along. Very convenient.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR: [GENUINELY UPSET] No. No, it isn’t. It’s like... a nothingness... where everything should be. I expect you can remember lots about your past, can’t you? You must’ve lived a long time. I mean, I know you have, because of all those times you defeated the Daleks. You’ve had different faces, been different people. I know all that about you, Doctor. Can you remember all that?\nDOCTOR: Yes... of course.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Imagine what it would be like... not to.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks did something to me. I don’t know what. I don’t know why. But my memories start from when I was their prisoner. And the first contact I had with\nDOCTOR: anything that wasn’t a Dalek was when I found out about you. I know that must sound a bit strange. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: [A LONG SIGH. HE’S NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK]\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER BLEEPING FROM THE CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: The Daleks’ generators have reached maximum energy levels.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Which means they’re about to dematerialize this whole station, the viruses—\nDOCTOR: And probably even the Viyran ship. Which means we have to\nDOCTOR: stop them. [STARTS WORK ON THE CONSOLE]\nDOCTOR: CONTROLS OPERATING.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: All right. But can I ask you just one thing?\nDOCTOR: [WORKING FURIOUSLY] Make it quick. I’ve got quite a few rather complicated things to do here.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Will you help me find out who I really am, Doctor? And—\nDOCTOR: You said one thing.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Can I stay?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR WHO: TIME GENERATOR HUM IS VIBRANT AND FULL NOW.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: All generators at maximum.\nDALEK COMMANDER: We can now return to our own time.

SOMETHING SPARKS ON THE CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY : Argh!\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t fuss! It’s only a few sparks and some smoke.\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER, BIGGER SPARK.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Whatever you’re doing... it feels like it’s going to blow the TARDIS up!\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. Just a bit of time jousting. I think the Daleks will find they can’t dematerialize while the TARDIS is competing for the same space-time location in the Vortex. Impressed?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: I always have been, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hmmm... well, unfortunately, it’s draining every drop of spare power the old girl can muster.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : How long can we hold out?\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure. It’s just a question of who\nDOCTOR: blinks first.\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER CIRCUIT BLOWS NOISILY.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: A LARGE GROUP OF VIYRANS ARE WALKING.

Daleks!\nDOCTOR: Oh no... with this much of a power drain, the TARDIS’s defences are down.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: You mean... ?\nDOCTOR: MUTED SOUND OF DALEK GUNFIRE FROM OUTSIDE.\nDOCTOR: Charley, get down!\nDOCTOR: A MASSIVE EXPLOSION AS THE TARDIS DOOR BLOWS OPEN. DEBRIS CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: THE SOUND OF DALEKS MOVING IN. MILA/CHARLEY : Doctor! The Daleks are getting in! They’re getting into\nDOCTOR: the TARDIS!!!\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3: Do not move! Shut down the power of your TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: [STALLING FOR TIME] Well which is it to be? Do I not\nDOCTOR: move or do I shut down the power? Make your mind up!\nDOCTOR: DALEK 4: Destroy the console!\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR: DALEKS FIRE. HUGE EXPLOSION.\nDOCTOR: THE POWER OF THE TARDIS WINDS DOWN DRAMATICALLY TO NOTHING.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 146\nDOCTOR: [QUIETLY] Oh no...\nDOCTOR: DALEK 3: You will come with us!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: TIME GENERATOR POWER WINDS DOWN.\nDALEK DRONE: TARDIS power now shut down.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Recalibrate time transfer generators and begin again.\nDALEK DRONE: The Doctor and his human female associate have been captured.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Exterminate the human!\nDALEK DRONE: Readings indicate the human has had contact with Patient Zero.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Keep her alive for interrogation!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: COMMS BLEEP.\nDALEK DRONE: Patrols nine and six are reporting in.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: [DISTORT] Patrol nine reporting.

Do not question the Daleks!\nVIYRAN: We have been summoned in accordance with the terms of The Great Armistice Treaty. None may interfere with our mission—\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: Silence! You will obey Dalek commands!\nVIYRAN: We have the ultimate authority. We have come to take the viruses. You will surrender them to us.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: We will take the viruses for our own purposes. You will assist us.\nVIYRAN: You will disconnect your machinery from the power conduits of this base and leave.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: Obey or die!\nVIYRAN: We are the Viyrans. We have our mission. We obey no one. We have the ultimate authority.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: Destroy them! Destroy them all!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 149\nDALEKS: We obey!\nDALEKS: MASSED DALEK FIRING.\nFRATALINS: Noooo!\nFRATALINS: HUGE SQUELCHING SOUND AS THE FRATALINS ENVELOPE A DALEK.\nDALEK: Aaargh! I cannot see! My vision is impaired!\nDALEK: FIRING CONTINUES. MAYHEM.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: DALEKS ENTER. FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND CHARLEY WITH THEM.\nDALEK COMMANDER: It is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hello again. Which of you is in command, then?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Be careful, Doctor.\nDALEK COMMANDER: I command! You will answer my questions.\nDOCTOR: Fire away... although I must say I’m surprised. I thought that other one sounded more intelligent. Let me guess,\nDOCTOR: that’d be you? The Dalek Time Controller?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Your attempt to stop us has failed.\nDOCTOR: Well, we don’t seem to be going anywhere. Seems very much as if I’ve succeeded to me.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Our power vectors have been realigned. We are about to commence dematerialization.\nDOCTOR: And precisely where and when will we be going?\nDALEK COMMANDER: Silence! What is your purpose here?\nDOCTOR: To defeat you, no change there.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: You did not expect the arrival of the Daleks. Why were you here, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why should that concern you?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: My temporal strategy must take account of all random factors.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 151\nDOCTOR: Getting a little conscientious about time travel in our old age, aren’t we? My experience of Daleks is that they blunder through time causing chaos where and whenever they go.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Non-strategic damage to the timelines has the potential to harm Dalek interests.\nDOCTOR: I’m impressed, I really am. And who is this Patient Zero you’re looking for?\nDALEK COMMANDER: Your female associate has had contact with Patient Zero.\nDOCTOR: Have you?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: I don’t know what they’re talking about. [TO THE DALEKS] What do you mean?\nDALEK COMMANDER: Our perceptors show residual traces of contact with her.\nDOCTOR: Her?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: But I haven’t met anyone since I’ve been here... except you and Fratalin.\nDOCTOR: Who exactly is this Patient Zero?\nDALEK COMMANDER: She was part of a viral experiment to mutate all sentient life into Daleks.\nDOCTOR: That’s obscene!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: She escaped. We have been tracking her through time and space.\nDOCTOR: [ALMOST TO HIMSELF] And you traced her here... to this\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 152\nDOCTOR WHO: station-full of viruses.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: But now we have these viruses, it does not matter. We will return to the future and begin our work again, with infinitely improved resources. Now, answer! What are you doing here, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: None of your business.\nDALEK COMMANDER: You will be exterminated!\nDALEK COMMANDER: MILA/CHARLEY: [NERVOUS ] Doctor...\nDOCTOR: [INTIMATE, TO HER] It’s all right.. [TO DALEKS] But have you had time to assess the significance of my ‘random’ presence here? Dare you risk killing me? Who knows what my real purpose here is.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Silence or you die!\nDOCTOR: Well, Dalek Time Controller?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Keep them alive. We will take them back to our fleet in the future. There, they will be fully interrogated, and then they can be used as the new subjects for our viral experiments.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: MILA/CHARLEY: No!\nDOCTOR: [CLOSE] Don’t worry, Charley. While there’s life\nDOCTOR: there’s hope.\nDALEK COMMANDER: For you, there is no hope! Take them into the ship!\nDALEK COMMANDER: DALEK DRONE MOVES ACROSS TOWARDS THEM.\nDALEK DRONE: I obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 153\nDOCTOR WHO: AN EXPLOSION OFF TO ONE SIDE. THEN A DALEK BLAST.\nDALEK: [DISTANT] Exterminate!\nDALEK: THE SOUND OF FRATALIN ENVELOPING A DALEK.\nDALEK COMMANDER: What is happening?\nDOCTOR: Sounds like trouble, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER DALEK BLAST. HUGE EXPLOSION. DEBRIS FALLING.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, look out!\nDOCTOR: Quickly, Charley, take cover!\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: Patrol Nine reporting! Aliens are resistant to firepower!\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: DALEKS FIRE EN MASSE.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: AN EXPLOSION. THEN THE EXPLOSION KIND OF REVERSES.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: SOUND OF ADVANCING VIYRANS.\nDALEK PATROL NINE LEADER: CUT TO CLOSE ACOUSTIC AS DOCTOR AND CHARLEY HIDE BEHIND DEBRIS.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Yes.. did you see that? Those must be the Viyrans.\nDOCTOR: Remarkable creatures.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: That’s one word for it. Those Daleks shot that one. It blew up, then just seemed to... reassemble itself.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Exterminate! Maximum firepower!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 154\nDOCTOR WHO: THEY FIRE AGAIN. EXPLOSIONS. THEN UN-EXPLOSIONS.\nVIYRAN: [FRATALIN’S VOICE]\nVIYRAN: We are the Viyrans. You will not stand against our mission. Disconnect the Dalek machinery from Amethyst’s power conduits.\nVIYRAN: SOUND OF VIYRANS MOVING.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: They must not disconnect the generators! Exterminate them! Exterminate!\nDALEK COMMANDER: Fire! Fire! Fire!\nDALEK COMMANDER: MASSED DALEK BLASTS. CONTINUOUS BATTLE. VIYRANS EXPLODING THEN UNEXPLODING. BATTLE RAGES IN THE BACKGROUND AS...\nDOCTOR: Fratalin! Fratalin! Over here!\nDOCTOR: SQUELCHING AS FRATALINS MOVE CLOSER.\nFRATALINS: Doctor! What happened? I thought you would be safe in\nFRATALINS: your TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately not!\nDOCTOR: A DALEK BLAST.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, get down!\nDOCTOR: THE BLAST IMPACTS ON THE FRATALINS.\nFRATALINS: Aaaaaaaaaaargnh!\nFRATALINS: THE UNPLEASANT FRYING SOUND.\nFRATALINS: MILA/CHARLEY: No! They’ve killed him.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Fratalin?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 155\nFRATALIN: [WEAK, IN PAIN] So many of my Familiars.. dead.\nDOCTOR: I know. I’m so sorry. Are you going to be all right?\nFRATALIN: All right? I have lost so much of myself... and they will never return to me. It is a terrible feeling.\nFRATALIN: ANOTHER DALEK BLAST IMPACTS NEARBY.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY:\nFRATALIN: Doctor, this battle is a complete stalemate. AS soon as the Viyrans re-form themselves, the Daleks are blasting them to pieces again.\nDOCTOR: What kind of creatures are these Viyrans, Fratalin?\nFRATALIN: I cannot tell you.\nDOCTOR: Well... Will they ever give up?\nFRATALIN: Never.\nDOCTOR: As I suspected.\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER RANDOM BLAST AND EXPLOSION.\nDOCTOR: But what really worries me is the collateral damage. Too much damage to Amethyst, and the virus containment fields could be broken. Am I right?\nFRATALIN: You are... regrettably, Doctor.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: And the viruses will escape into space.\nFRATALIN: To cause untold damage in this galaxy.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got an idea. Follow me!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 156\nDOCTOR WHO: FADE UP ON BATTLE.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Destroy them! Destroy them!\nDALEK COMMANDER: ANOTHER FUSILLADE OF DALEK FIRE. VIYRANS EXPLODE THEN RE-FORM.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR, MILA/CHARLEY AND FRATALIN RUN IN. THE MUTED SOUND OF BATTLE OUTSIDE.\nDOCTOR WHO: DOOR CLOSES BEHIND THEM.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: What are we doing in here, Doctor?\nFRATALIN: Isn’t this the Dalek time ship?\nDOCTOR: Yes.. and luckily, all the Daleks are outside trying to stop the Viyrans.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : You’re going to do something clever, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: I’m beginning to think I could get used to this admiration, Charley. It’s doing wonders for my confidence. But yes, as a matter of fact, I have a plan. [LOOKING FRANTICALLY AROUND THE CONTROL ROOM. ] Err... Hmm...\nFRATALIN: What are you looking for, Doctor?\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Some kind of Dalek technology?\nDOCTOR: Well... obviously!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Well, what? I might be able to help.\nDOCTOR: Wha—? Oh yes. Central power controls?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Um... here!\nDOCTOR: THEY WALK TO THE CONTROL UNIT.\nDOCTOR: You really do know your Daleks, don’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: So... now what?\nDOCTOR: Um...\nDOCTOR: A FEW CONTROLS OPERATED. Uh-huh. Yes. And... MORE CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR: There!\nDOCTOR: Page 158\nDOCTOR: THE HEARTBEAT OF THE DALEK CONTROL ROOM IS STARTING TO\nDOCTOR: QUICKEN, THE PITCH RISING.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY :\nDOCTOR: But you’ve.. oh no, Doctor. You’ve.. I can’t believe you\nDOCTOR: did that.\nFRATALIN: What has he done?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 159\nDOCTOR WHO: BATTLE CONTINUES.\nDALEK DRONE: Alert! Dalek Time Ship power levels approaching danger level!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The Doctor! He has interfered!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 160\nDOCTOR WHO: HEARTBEAT QUICKER, HIGHER, LOUDER. IT GROWS IN INTENSITY THROUGHOUT. WE ARE CLEARLY HEADING FOR A BIG BANG.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: This is insane! You’re just going to kill us all!\nDOCTOR: Maybe... maybe not.\nFRATALIN: I don’t understand. You’ve done something foolish?\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY :\nFRATALIN: Foolish! He’s only gone and set the Dalek power controls to overload. This ship and probably your whole station is about to explode. Have you got an escape plan?\nDOCTOR: Well, the TARDIS may be ailing a little at the moment, but we could effectively shelter in her.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : How are we going to get there? This thing’s about to blow any second.\nFRATALIN: Your self-sacrifice is a noble gesture... But, Doctor, the explosion won’t destroy the viruses, it will just spread them. Only Amesthustra is powerful enough to—\nDOCTOR: Possibly, possibly. But I think I’m gambling on a\nDOCTOR: certainty!\nFRATALIN: What certainty?\nFRATALIN: THE POWER WHINE HAS REACHED AN INTOLERABLE LEVEL. AN EXPLOSION BEGINS.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, look out!!!\nFRATALIN: SUDDENLY THE EXPLOSION STOPS. SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: That. That’s the certainty I was gambling on.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY : The explosion... it’s just...\nFRATALIN: Frozen?\nDOCTOR: Frozen in time.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Who’s doing that?\nDOCTOR: Shall we go outside and see? Come on.\nDOCTOR: FOOTSTEPS. DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: Page 161\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 162\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Regulate time vectors! Correct flow! Correct flow!\nDALEK DRONE: I obey.\nDALEK DRONE: TIME TRANSFER GENERATORS WHIRRING. VERY ACTIVE. CONTROLS OPERATING.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Maintain temporal equilibrium on all generators.\nDALEKS: [VARIOUSLY, AND CONTINUING IN BACKGROUND]\nDALEKS: I obey. Maintaining, maintaining. Counting from zero four. Equalize.\nDALEKS: Preparing stability check. Stability check at point seven. Maintain. Strengthen temporal field.\nDOCTOR: Rather preoccupied, aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: VIYRANS APPROACH.\nDOCTOR: Er.. Fratalin, do you think you could convince your Viyran friends not to disconnect the time generators?\nFRATALIN: But what... what’s going on, Doctor?\nVIYRAN: We must carry out our mission. The alien machines must be disconnected.\nDOCTOR: Those ‘alien machines’ are the only thing keeping this place from blowing up.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: The Daleks are holding back the explosion.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : How did you know they’d do that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 163\nDOCTOR: Oh come on, now. Didn’t you say you knew the Daleks of old? I overloaded the power of their ship to the point of explosion, and the Daleks are sitting out here next to several highly advanced time transfer generators. What do you think they’re likely to do?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : [REALIZING] Anything to hold back localized time, to stop the explosion.\nDOCTOR: Yes, isn’t that right, Dalek commander?\nDALEK COMMANDER: [PREOCCUPIED] You... you will be exterminated!\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think you’re only too well aware that it wouldn’t be a good idea to let off a high energy weapon in such a delicately balanced time suspension field... Isn’t that right, Dalek Time Controller?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: We... we will contain... the explosion... We will reverse it! And then we will destroy you!\nDOCTOR: Well, I certainly admire you for trying. Viyrans, I suggest you get on with your removal of the viruses. The Daleks won’t let their ship blow up. They’1l hold that explosion at bay for eternity if necessary. Isn’t that right, Mr Time Controller?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: We... will... control and reverse! Control and reverse!\nDOCTOR: Of course you will. If you can ever control a time\nDOCTOR: suspension field without a dimensional stabilizer. Got one of those handy, have you? Mmm? Thought not.\nDOCTOR: VIYRANS MOVING OFF.\nDOCTOR: Oh, there they go. Fratalin, I suggest you maybe go with your Viyran friends when they finally leave. Nothing left for you here when they’ve done their duties, is there?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 164\nDOCTOR WHO: I.. I suppose not. Doctor, I think you’ve done an incredible thing here today.\nDOCTOR: You’ re too kind.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Except, isn’t the TARDIS broken?\nDOCTOR: The old girl will be in a regenerative cycle by now. Yes, in fact, I can feel it in my bones. It’1ll take a\nDOCTOR: while, but she should be all right. Eventually.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : [LAUGHS, WARMLY. IMPRESSED]\nDOCTOR: My dear Miss Pollard... Are you regarding me in an admiring fashion?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Might be.\nDOCTOR: Well don’t. It’s making me feel queasy. And in answer to your earlier question, you can stay.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Thank you, Doctor. You won’t regret it.\nDOCTOR: But only if you soft-pedal on the admiration.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : You like it really.\nDOCTOR: Hm...\nDOCTOR: FADE OUT.\nDOCTOR: MUSIC. A SHORT PASSAGE OF TIME.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 165\nDOCTOR WHO: UNCERTAIN BACKGROUND SOUND. A FEW SWITCHES FLICK. NO BLEEPS OR BURBLES.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: How is she?\nDOCTOR: Hmmm. Nowhere near back to normal, I’m afraid. But we should be able to make enough of a short hop away from here to be safe.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Safe? From the Daleks, you mean? Will they eventually lose their battle to stop the explosion.\nDOCTOR: It’s inevitable. Only their arrogance is blinding them from that. Know thine enemy, Charley.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY :\nDOCTOR: You keep calling me Charley, now. I like that.\nDOCTOR: Do I? I hadn’t noticed.\nDOCTOR: OPERATES DOOR CONTROLS. DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: I just want to check how much longer the Daleks can hold off the explosion.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [CALLING AFTER HIM] Going to gloat? Don’t you think that’s a bit dangerous?\nDOCTOR: They’1l be far too occupied. As I said... Know thine enemy, Charley... One of the most important lessons I ever learnt.\nDOCTOR: CROSS-FADE TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 166\nDOCTOR WHO: TIME TRANSFER GENERATORS WHIRRING. VERY ACTIVE. CONTROLS OPERATING.\nDALEKS: [VARIOUSLY, AND CONTINUING IN BACKGROUND]\nDALEKS: I obey. Maintaining, maintaining. Counting from zero four. Equalize.\nDALEKS: Preparing stability check. Stability check at point seven. Maintain. Strengthen temporal field.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Continue... Continue... Regulate time vectors! Correct flow! Correct flow!\nDALEK DRONE: Regulating.\nDALEK DRONE: FOOTSTEPS AS DOCTOR ENTERS AND STOPS.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Maintain... maintain... maintain... temporal equilibrium on all generators.\nDOCTOR: I know you can hear me. No use pretending.\nDALEK COMMANDER: You... you will die... die for this.\nDOCTOR: Oh really? Then stop what you’re doing. And risk firing your weapon.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Other Daleks... other Daleks in the... the station.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, don’t rely on those. Fratalin conjoined with hundreds of his surviving Familiars throughout the station. Your other Dalek patrols have been put out of action for more than long enough.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. JUST THE CHATTER OF THE DALEKS, STRUGGLING WITH THE TIME CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 167\nDOCTOR WHO: [CHECKING CONTROLS] Hmm... seems the TARDIS will have enough time to get away. Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: You know, I should be grateful that you never learn, shouldn’t I? Grateful that ultimately, it always boils down to one simple move that outwits you, ties you in knots or destroys you. It’s often a long time coming, and the suffering along the way... sickens me.\nDOCTOR WHO: But sometimes, what really hurts about you, the Daleks, the ‘supreme beings’ is that you fly in the face of\nDOCTOR WHO: everything I hope for in the universe. Change. Growth. Learning. The ability of creatures to eventually transcend their own limitations. To become something better.\nDOCTOR WHO: And here you are, trapped in your rage to survive and exterminate. Believe me when I say... it’s truly pitiful.\nDOCTOR WHO: Good-bye.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: What... ?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: What... would you... would you have us... us learn, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That there are other ways.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Other... strategies?\nDOCTOR: If you like. For example, what good could these viruses actually do you?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: We found a virus that, if developed, would—\nDOCTOR: Turn everyone into a Dalek, yes, I know. And what would be the point of that? Oh. Making everyone in your own image. I suppose I should’ve expected that of you. The ultimate delusion. [IDLE CURIOSITY] Where did you find this virus, by the way?\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 168\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: We... have found... many... many viruses drifting through time and space. When Patient Zero escaped... we traced as many of them... as we could. That strategy led us.. here.\nDOCTOR: Here? The Amethyst Viral Containment Station?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: We tracked Patient Zero back in time to this remote galaxy beyond all known civilizations. But she is not here. What does that mean, Doctor? Teach us something?\nDOCTOR: Ah well... the best laid plans... Wait a minute. If we’re so far back in time, how come those viruses were present in your... ? Oh no.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Yes?\nDOCTOR: [SUDDENLY WORRIED] No. It doesn’t matter. Good-bye.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: What do you teach us... Doc-tor? You want the Daleks... to\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: learn? I am learning. I am learning!\nDOCTOR: No! No, you’re not! You’re incapable of learning!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The viruses we discovered were scattered through time and Space. Scattered through time and space.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: FOOTSTEPS AS MILA/CHARLEY APPROACHES.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor? Is everything all right?\nDOCTOR: Get back to the TARDIS, Charley.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Oooh, Charley again. Becoming quite a habit—\nDOCTOR: No time for that nonsense, just do as I Say, now!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 169\nDOCTOR WHO: CLICK OF CONTROLS. COMMS BLEEP. Fratalin? Fratalin, come in please. Fratalin?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: You have taught me something... Doctor... I see... I see what you have taught me!\nFRATALIN: [DISTORT] Doctor? Hello? What can I do for you?\nDOCTOR: Get to the control centre immediately. I need you, now!!!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, what’s going on? What have you done?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: The Doctor... has taught us what our true victory is! This will be the ultimate victory of the Daleks!\nDOCTOR: No! And Charley, I told you to go.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I won’t leave you. I’11 never leave you.\nDOCTOR: Stop that!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I can help, you know I can!\nDOCTOR: Not this time.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: [TAUNTING HIM] The viruses were scattered through time and space. That is the effect. What is the cause? Can\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: you teach us that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. I can’t.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Or.. you won’t? I have learnt!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: FRATALIN ENTERS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 170\nDOCTOR WHO: Doctor, what can I do to help?\nDOCTOR: [LOW AND FEVERISH, ALMOST A WHISPER] Show me how to overload the power of this station. I need to senda\nDOCTOR: devasting power spike through the Dalek time generators.\nFRATALIN: But... I thought... Why?\nDOCTOR: Why?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: I can hear your words! This is the moment! This is the victory! This is the cause! This is the explosion that caused the dissemination of viruses throughout time and\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: space, the viruses we found and developed! This is your purpose in the timeline, Doctor! You assist the Daleks\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: in their greatest victory of all time!!!\nDOCTOR: That’s why! We have to create an explosion so powerful that it will completely destroy everything here. You understand me?\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: All Daleks! Cease work on the time generators! Allow the explosion to continue.\nDALEK COMMANDER: Why? It will destroy us! We cannot let it destroy us!\nFRATALIN: But Doctor... are you sure? It will kill all of us... perhaps even the Viyrans—\nDOCTOR: Better that than these viruses should be spread throughout time and space for the Daleks to exploit.\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: Our destruction will assure the dissemination of the viruses. Viruses the Daleks will develop to wipe out all resistance!\nDALEK TIME CONTROLLER: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, there must be another—\nDOCTOR: Didn’t I tell you to get back to the TARDIS?!! Go back,\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 171\nDOCTOR WHO: shut the doors, you’ll be safe!\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: Safe, alone and trapped. What’s the point of-—?\nDOCTOR: For heaven’s sake, don’t argue with me, girl! Charley, please.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: No, I won’t leave you. Never.\nFRATALIN: Help me with the controls, Doctor. I’m putting the power levels at maximum, but I need your help with—\nDOCTOR: Of course, of course. Here... let me\nDOCTOR: AN ALMIGHTY WHACK AS THE DOCTOR IS HIT WITH A PIECE OF DEBRIS.\nDOCTOR: Ugh. HE FALLS UNCONSCIOUS.\nFRATALIN: What did you do that for?\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: [TRUE COLOURS] You may be willing to sacrifice yourself. But not me. And I won’t let him do it either. I’ve\nFRATALIN: fought too long and hard to be at his side to see him blow himself up at the first opportunity. Will you summon a couple of your familiars to help me carry the Doctor? [PICKING DOCTOR UP, STRUGGLING] Come on, Doctor... Well, Fratalin?\nFRATALIN: Very well, Charley. I will have them meet you at the shuttle train.\nFRATALIN: MILA/CHARLEY: Good luck to you, Fratalin. [SHE STRUGGLES OFF, CARRYING THE DOCTOR]\nDALEK COMMANDER: All Daleks. Disengage from time generators. We will allow the explosion to continue. We will take our place in Dalek history. This is our victoryyyyyyyy!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 172\nFRATALIN: Not if I can help it.\nFRATALIN: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 173\nDOCTOR WHO: MUCH PATTING OF DOCTOR’S FACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor... Doctor, please, wake up! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [GASPS AS HE COMES ROUND.] What... what... ? Charley?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Oh thank goodness you’re all right. I thought when that piece of debris hit you—\nDOCTOR: Piece of debris?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Well, I was worried that Fratalin wouldn’t be able to—\nDOCTOR: To set off the explosion himself? No, he needed my help.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: He said he’d be all right! He told me to get you back to the TARDIS. That he’d set off the explosion himself.\nDOCTOR: But...\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Oh, doctor, never mind all that just now. You have to get the TARDIS moving.\nDOCTOR: Get it moving?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Yes, the Daleks were about to release the explosion and Fratalin was overloading the—\nDOCTOR: MASSIVE EXPLOSION. BOTH DOCTOR AND CHARLEY CRY OUT.\nDOCTOR: THEIR VOICES ARE FILTERING STRANGELY. A TEMPORAL DISTORTION EFFECT.\nDOCTOR: It’s... it’s a temporal explosion! No! Fratalin failed!\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 174\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: Will... will we be safe in here?\nDOCTOR: Not for long! Help me with the controls! There! There! And there! Got them?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Yes.\nDOCTOR: Keep pressing... and...\nDOCTOR: CONTROLS CLICK AND BLEEP.\nDOCTOR: A THUD OF THE TARDIS’S ENGINES. THEN THEY WHOOSH INTO ACTION.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [OVER THE DIN] Is that it?!? Are we going to make it?\nDOCTOR: We’re caught in the temporal shockwave!\nDOCTOR: A MASSIVE EXPLOSIVE JOLT. And it may yet destroy us!\nDOCTOR: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR: AS THEME FADES, CROSS-FADE TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: PATIENT ZERO by Nicholas Briggs Page 175\nDOCTOR WHO: THE REAL CHARLEY.\nDOCTOR WHO: FROM INSIDE A GLASS COFFIN. THE LISTENER WILL NOT KNOW THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT THE ACOUSTIC MUST SOUND CONFINED.\nCHARLEY: Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Doctor? Doctor, where are you? Where am I?\nCHARLEY: SOUND OF VIYRAN APPROACHING.\nVIYRAN: [FRATALIN’S VOICE] The first phase of your treatment has begun.\nCHARLEY: Can you cure me?\nVIYRAN: The virus was mutated. It is impossible to tell.\nVIYRAN: A GROWING WHINE OF HIGH PITCHED ENERGY.\nCHARLEY: What are you doing? What— ? No...\nCHARLEY: THE PITCH BECOMES ALMOST UNBEARABLE. No... No! Please no!\nCHARLEY: CUT TO SILENCE.\nCHARLEY: 231163-15"
