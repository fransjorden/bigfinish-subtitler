When I was in the Falklands they taught us all about things like that.\nCAITLIN: (MOCKING) They taught you about picking locks in the Falklands? Why?\nKEVIN: I can’t answer that, Caitlin. I signed a form.\nMATTHEW: Right, so they made you sign a form that lets you talk when you want to impress us, then shut up when you’re about to expose your lack of first-hand knowledge.\nKEVIN: What are you saying?\nCAITLIN: He’s saying he doesn’t believe you were in the Falklands and neither do I.\nKEVIN: Do you realise how disrespectful that is? All my friends who died. All the things I saw...\nCAITLIN: On television.\nKEVIN: Do you want my help or not? Don’t forget who brought you the map in the first place.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 4\nMATTHEW: So if we don’t stop being mean to you, you’ll go home and take your ball with you?

Come on Nyssa, we’re supposed to be friends!\nNYSSA: Really, I’m fine.\nTEGAN: No you’re not. What are you doing with all this gear? It looks like my old chemistry lab back at school!\nNYSSA: I’m trying to isolate the Richter’s Syndrome virus. This was the best that I could find in the TARDIS. And it’s still not enough!\nTEGAN: Richter’s? Why are you bothered about Richter’s?\nNYSSA: After everything that happened on Samur, everything that happened to Turlough...\nTEGAN: That boy. Since then, he’s not said a word about it. About her.\nNYSSA: . Tegan, it’s time I went home.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 7\nTEGAN: Oh. Right. I — well, I guess you’d better talk to the Doctor about that. I only hope he can get you there.\nNYSSA: The thing is, I need to take the Richter’s cure with me. I can’t leave everyone I love exposed to such a terrible disease.\nTEGAN: But don’t you still have the cure we found on Hellheim?\nNYSSA: Yes. But the vaccine is failing.\nTEGAN: What do you mean? It worked fine on us!\nNYSSA: That’s because we were injected as soon as it was created. But now it’s destabilising, and I don’t know how to stop it.\nTEGAN: What do you mean, destabilising?\nNYSSA: The binary strands are degrading, the protein base is losing cohesion... Soon we’1ll have nothing.\nTEGAN: Then we’ll fix it. We all had the vaccine injected into us, so perhaps our blood holds the key? You know, to restabilising the whatsits in your vaccine?\nNYSSA: I suppose that might be an option...\nTEGAN: Come on, the Doctor asked me to find you.

Do you think this place is still active?\nMATTHEW: Could be.\nKEVIN: Well this changes things, doesn’t it? I mean, there could be people here...\nCAITLIN: Yes, there could.\nKEVIN: You sound excited.\nCAITLIN: ‘Secret military experiments happened thirty years ago’ is a good story. ‘Secret military experiments happening right now under your nose’ is time to pick out a nice frock to wear to the awards ceremony.\nMATTHEW: Why, Kevin? Are you scared?\nKEVIN: No, it’s just... a mission is only as good as its intelligence.\nMATTHEW: Did they teach you that in the Falklands?\nKEVIN: It’s common sense. This wasn’t what we prepared for.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 9\nCAITLIN: If we’d known, what would we have done differently? Gone in armed? I don’t think so.\nMATTHEW: She’s right, Kevin. Turn back if you want, but after two hours trudging [through these —]\nKEVIN: No, I don’t want to go back.\nMATTHEW: Right then. We’1ll just have to be a bit more cautious, that’s all. Come on.\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) I never thought I’d even see a picture of these tunnels, let alone be in them!\nKEVIN: Is it a telephone exchange? Those switchboards almost look brand new.\nCAITLIN: (WALKING) Get this map out then, Kevin. Let’s see how accurate at 1S’\nKEVIN: (PAUSES TO A STOP) Wait a mo.. it’s in my rucksack.\nCAITLIN: (SHOCKED) Whoa whoa whoa! Stop right there! What was that I just saw? Was that dynamite in your bag?\nKEVIN: Yes.\nMATTHEW: What are you playing, at bringing that with you?\nKEVIN: I just thought if we couldn’t pick the locks, we should have a back-up plan. I put it together myself. Some dynamite, some nitro-glycerine...\nCAITLIN: I wondered before, but now I know for sure: Kevin, you’re insane!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5. INT. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. )\nDOCTOR: Ah, Tegan, you found Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Tegan said you had something that might... Brighten our day, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I have indeed! The TARDIS is being a bit stubborn with temporal calibrations past the twenty-first century at the moment, so while it self-rectifies that, I thought we should go on a field trip!\nTEGAN: Knowing you, that means a trip... to a field.\nNYSSA: Turlough, what have you and the Doctor been planning?\nTURLOUGH: Don’t look at me, he’s been talking about this all morning.\nDOCTOR: Cadogan Castle! Oh, you’1ll love it, Nyssa! Eleven Twenty-Three. Smack bang in the middle of the age of chivalry!\nTURLOUGH: ‘In days of old, when Knights were bold.’\nNYSSA: Yes, I remember the Knights I met in Stockbridge.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but — this was the very day that the Treaty of The Marshes was Signed! History in the making! Well, already made, really. But there’1ll be feasts, and dancing, jousting...\nTEGAN: I saw a Ren Fayre in Sydney once. They had jousting. Two fat guys, half drunk on lager. Funniest thing I ever saw.\nNYSSA: What is this... jousting?\nTEGAN: Well, you have two men in plate armour, on horses. They line up, facing each other down a long, narrow course...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 11\nTURLOUGH: And then they charge at full speed, trying to spear each other with a long wooden pole.\nNYSSA: That sounds barbaric!\nDOCTOR: (CLICKING SWITCHES ON THE CONSOLE) Thank you, Turlough. Actually it’s much more fun than it sounds. They try to knock each other off the horses rather than run each other through. Strategy and skill. Even the Kings were known to joust. (BEAT) But it’1ll be fun! And let’s face it, we could all do with a bit of fun now, couldn’t we? There are jugglers and archery contests...\nTEGAN: We can stick Turlough in the stocks and throw fruit at him...\nTURLOUGH: Yes. Marvellous. I’1l just go and shoot myself now, shall I?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6. INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (TARDIS CORRIDOR).\nDOCTOR: Ah. The TARDIS seems to have... overshot the mark, somewhat.\nTEGAN: (EXITING THE TARDIS) You think? An old tunnel’s not quite my idea of a grand day out, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (EXPLORING) The walls are well made, the tunnel has a perfect arch above us! Look at that! Interesting tiling pattern, too...\nNYSSA: There’s electric lighting as well. A desk and a typewriter. I don’t think we’re when you think we are, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that does put us a bit further ahead than I thought...\nTURLOUGH: (INTERRUPTING) What was Operation Daylight?\nDOCTOR: Daylight? It was a covert Allied mission during the Second World War... Where did you get that from?\nTURLOUGH: Papers on the desk. See?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING TO THE DESK) Operation Daylight! Well, at least we’re in the right place, anyway!\nNYSSA: How did you come to that conclusion?\nDOCTOR: Operation Daylight was a Second World War attempt at liberating France. It was controlled from a set of underground war rooms deep in the cliffs under Cadogan Castle! Right place, just the wrong time!\nTURLOUGH: Well, it seems deserted.\nNYSSA: No it’s not. I think I hear voices...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (UPPER LEVELS).\nCAITLIN: You idiot, Kevin.\nKEVIN: Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the explosives. Stop going on about it.\nMATTHEW: You could kill us all!\nCAITLIN: I’m going to kill him in a minute.\nMATTHEW: If you slip and fall, they could go off.\nKEVIN: (BEAT) Really?\nMATTHEW: Yes. And setting anything off down here would only bring the whole tunnel down on [our heads —]\nCAITLIN: What was that?\nKEVIN: What was what?\nCAITLIN: I heard something move.\nMATTHEW: It’s probably a rat.\nCAITLIN: It sounded too big to be a rat.\nMATTHEW: Probably a very big rat then.\nKEVIN: You think someone’s watching us?\nCAITLIN: It didn’t sound like a person either.\nKEVIN: I see him! Over there, by the wall!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 14\nMATTHEW: You’re right, there is someone.\nCAITLIN: I told you, it didn’t sound —\nKEVIN: (CALLS) I’m warning you, we’ve got explosives.\nMATTHEW: Shh! (CALLS) Look, ignore him — we’re not going to blow you up. We're just... we wanted to ask —\nCAITLIN: He isn’t moving. I’m telling you, it wasn’t him I heard.\nMATTHEW: Are you all right?\nKEVIN: Be careful! It could be a trap, he could be pretending, he could be...\nKEVIN: (FX: TAPPING ON A SHOULDER, THEN THE THUMP OF A BODY HITTING THE FLOOR. )\nMATTHEW: Dead.\nKEVIN: (SCREAMS) Oh GOD!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (TARDIS CORRIDOR)\nTEGAN: Sounds like someone’s in trouble.\nNYSSA: We should go and help.\nTURLOUGH: Do we all have to go?\nDOCTOR: No, I’ll check whether it’s safe first. You stay here.\nTEGAN: Wait — you’re not going on your own, I’m coming with you. You two, stay here.\nTURLOUGH: No complaints from me.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (UPPER LEVELS)\nCAITLIN: Are you all right now, Kevin?\nKEVIN: (IRRITABLY) Yes. It just gave me a bit of a flashback, that’s all.\nMATTHEW: He’s dead, all right. Looks like he’s been like that for hours. Army uniform.\nCAITLIN: These seem like defensive wounds — he was defending himself against something.\nKEVIN: What though?\nMATTHEW: I dunno. But judging from the cuts to his face and arms, I'd say about the size of a small dog, perhaps?\nKEVIN: You think there’s any more of them?\nMATTHEW: Any more soldiers, or any more of whatever killed this one?\nCAITLIN: If there’s military down here, this place must still be active.\nMATTHEW: Probably clearing the place out before it gets handed over.\nCAITLIN: Clearing out stuff they don’t want us to see perhaps?\nMATTHEW: Could be.\nKEVIN: Maybe we should call the police.\nCAITLIN: Someone’s coming.\nMATTHEW: And say what? ‘I’m sorry, officer, but while breaking into the Cadogan War Tunnels, I came across this dead soldier’?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: . and before you know it, you’re the one under suspicion. I do sympathise, happens to me all the time. Why don’t you tell me what happened?\nMATTHEW: Who are you?\nTEGAN: Who screamed? Was it you?\nCAITLIN: No, it was him.\nKEVIN: You didn’t have to tell him that.\nMATTHEW: Who are you? I assume you’re not army, dressed like that...\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor and this is my friend Tegan.\nKEVIN: Doctor of what?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know, this and that. Things that end in an ‘ology’, that sort of thing. (EXAMINING CORPSE) Not a lot I can do for this chap, unfortunately...\nTEGAN: Those wounds look horrible. Ugh.\nDOCTOR: Mmm. (TO KEVIN) Now, you found the body, didn’t you? That can cause deep subconscious shock. Can you tell me the date?\nKEVIN: I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: Just a simple test. If you could tell me the exact date.\nKEVIN: June the ninth, nineteen eighty three.\nDOCTOR: General Election day. It’1ll be a landslide, if I remember right.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 18\nMATTHEW: How would you know that? The polls have only been open for six hours!\nKEVIN: It’s the government, man! They’re fixing the votes!\nCAITLIN: No. I think you’re not meant to be here either, are you? (TO OTHERS) I think they’re here for the same reason we are.\nTEGAN: Which is what?\nMATTHEW: To find out the truth about these tunnels. I’m Matthew Dunbar from the Urban Explorers Collective, we check out disused and forgotten places in towns and cities. I’ve been interested in these tunnels for years.\nKEVIN: There’s been rumours of government experiments here. Dodgy stuff. Weapons. I’m Kevin Wilde — I met Matthew through the group and brought him this map.\nDOCTOR: And where did you get the map from?\nKEVIN: I’d rather not say.\nCAITLIN: He likes his air of mystery. I’m Caitlin Jones, freelance journalist. I talked to Matthew about these tunnels when I did a piece on his group a couple of years ago. When he decided to come down here he invited me along.\nDOCTOR: So these tunnels are supposed to be closed off? Shut down?\nKEVIN: You must know that, if you managed to get in here.\nTEGAN: We got in by accident.\nMATTHEW: How?\nDOCTOR: Never mind. So you’re simply curious and you came down here to investigate? Excellent. I approve of that.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 19\nCAITLIN: We were expecting it to be deserted though. We didn’t expect to find the lights still working, or dead soldiers on the floor.\nDOCTOR: No. Something is still going on down here. Shall we find out what?\nMATTHEW: You’re taking this very lightly.\nDOCTOR: I assure you, I’m not. I never take death lightly. But for me, the decision to get involved is never very difficult. [We should cover the body, then let’s find Nyssa and Turlough and get to the bottom of this, shall we?]\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. THE LAIR OF THE KING RAT.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BACKGROUND COMPUTER HUMMING. DRIPPING WATER, STRIKING PUDDLES. NOTE, ALL RATS SPEAK ‘TELEPATHICALLY’, A EFFECT MIGHT BE NEEDED.

Stranger different to the others. He knows something. He speaks of date. The result of election. There is something more there.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: We cannot discover where he came from. He and his companions simply appeared in the lower levels.\nWALLACE: (FROM OFF, WEAK AND FEEBLE) Please... Let me die...\nKING RAT: Ah, Wallace. Death not for quite a while. More experiments needed for you.\nWALLACE: No... I beg you...\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: Should we examine this new specimen closer?\nKING RAT: No, Technician Fifteen. This is interesting. We want to see what he does next.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: Three more specimens approaching from the south. About to intersect with two specimens in lower tunnels.\nKING RAT: The civil servant and his woman. The third is their warrior. This should be amusing.\nWALLACE: Stop this... let them go... You have me...\nKING RAT: Ask nicely.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 21\nWALLACE: Please... let them go.\nKING RAT: No! Hahaha! Mutoids! Come!\nMUTOID: (STUMBLING FORWARD, ZOMBIE-LIKE) Whurrrrghh...\nWALLACE: No! Get these monsters off me!\nKING RAT: Is that way to talk to your colleagues, Doctor Wallace? Take him to his cell!\nWALLACE: No! Let me die!\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: What do you want to do with these new specimens?\nKING RAT: Trap them. Like rats. Start security measure. Lock bunker down.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (TARDIS CORRIDOR)\nNYSSA: Turlough — look at this.\nTURLOUGH: A dead rat. In an old abandoned tunnel. Who’d have thought it?\nNYSSA: It’s much larger than a normal Terran rat... There’s something strange here. Would you pass me a pen please?\nTURLOUGH: There you go.\nNYSSA: Thanks.\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing?\nNYSSA: Checking that it’s dead. Which it is. There you go.\nTURLOUGH: No no, you keep it.\nNYSSA: Clear a space on the table.\nTURLOUGH: You’re not going to pick it up, are you?\nNYSSA: Please, Turlough, this might be important.\nNYSSA: Thank you.\nTURLOUGH: Why is it so interesting to you?\nNYSSA: Look at the size of its head.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 23\nTURLOUGH: Maybe it’s got some kind of disease. Leave it alone — we’ve had enough of that recently.\nNYSSA: Look at the cranial distribution. That’s not a product of natural evolution.\nTURLOUGH: You lost me at ‘cranial distribution’.\nNYSSA: It has a larger skull. Presumably, to house a much larger brain. Cauterised skin, and metal under the surface. Looks like it’s been operated on.\nTURLOUGH: Yes, maybe. But who would —\nHARRIS: Step away from the rat.\nNYSSA: Why?\nHARRIS: Because I don’t want you throwing it at me, that’s why. Anything can be a weapon in the right hands. Speaking of which, put them in the air.\nTURLOUGH: We’re not here to cause trouble.\nHARRIS: Oh no, of course not. And you wouldn’t know anything about the disappearance of three of my men in the past 24 hours, would you?\nNYSSA: No, we wouldn’t. We didn’t even know you had any men.\nHARRIS: Haven’t seen Peterson since this morning. He was the last of my squad. I’m just left with the pen-pushers now.\nTURLOUGH: Pen-pushers?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 24\nANDREWS: Major Harris means us.\nHARRIS: Can one of you manage to keep them covered while I check them for hidden weapons?\nSALLY: Yes, give me the gun.\nHARRIS: You first.\nNYSSA: (BEING MANHANDLED) There’s no need to be so aggressive.\nANDREWS: And what are you two doing down here?\nTURLOUGH: Er.. we got lost.\nANDREWS: I see.\nSALLY: I don’t remember seeing this blue door before. Where does it go?\nANDREWS: Let’s worry about them for the moment.\nHARRIS: This one’s clear.\nNYSSA: We’ve only just arrived. We don’t know what he’s talking about — who are you anyway?\nANDREWS: Clifford Andrews. Home Office. That’s Sally Lucas, my P.A. They’re selling this place to the English Heritage next month, and we were sent down here to make sure it’s clear of anything sensitive.\nSALLY: But then Major Harris’ men started disappearing.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 25\nHARRIS: This one’s clear too. Yes. Three men, all vanished since yesterday afternoon. What have you done with them? Dead? Or have you got them tied up somewhere?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa’s told you the truth — we’ve only just arrived, we don’t know anything.\nHARRIS: We'll see about that. You’re not going anywhere.\nNYSSA: I don’t think handcuffs are necessary!\nNYSSA: [ TURLOUGH: (FX: BEING HANDCUFFED THROUGH:) This is all we need. ]\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. THE LAIR OF THE KING RAT.\nTURLOUGH: (VIA MONITOR) (FX: BEING HANDCUFFED THROUGH: ) This is all we need.\nKING RAT: See the aggression of Harris. He wants revenge!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: The other humans are not afraid. Both have been threatened many times before. ‘Nyssa’ is very interesting. She seems filled with guilt over something called Richter’s.. It seems to be some kind of plague. The ‘Turlough’ only wishes to be somewhere else, safe and warm.\nKING RAT: A Plague? Interesting. And the others?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: The ‘Tegan’ worries about the tunnel collapsing on her. The Doctor... We cannot read his thoughts. There is a block.\nKING RAT: We would like to hear more. Attend them. Find what you can before we take them. Technician Fifteen? Secure base.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (LOWER LEVELS)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: NEAR THE TARDIS CORRIDOR. DOCTOR, TEGAN, CAITLIN, KEVIN AND MATTHEW WALKING THROUGH )\nDOCTOR: Just down here, wasn’t it Tegan?\nTEGAN: I don’t know, we were going so fast. [I think —]\nKEVIN: What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: The base is going into lockdown! What did you do?\nCAITLIN: Don’t look at us!\nTEGAN: What do you mean, lockdown?\nDOCTOR: After the Second World War, the Cadogan War Tunnels were obsolete, but with the arrival of the Cold War, the government needed nuclear shelters for the cabinet. Dover Castle, Cadogan, they made about five bunkers just like this, fitted them up with automatic doors and airlocks.\nMATTHEW: That’s what I heard. In the case of a nuclear war, the Prime Minister was to enter one, it would close behind him —\nCAITLIN: Or her.\nMATTHEW: —and he or she, and his or her aides would be safe. I didn’t know this was one.\nDOCTOR: Well, they do try to keep these things a secret.\nCAITLIN: Then how do you know?\nKEVIN: So they’ve dropped the bomb on Election Day? When we’re all distracted, of course!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING TO A DOOR) Let’s not jump to conclusions. Maybe something’s set it off accidentally, or...\nTEGAN: We won’t be able to get to Nyssa, or Turlough — or the TARDIS! Can you stop it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That sounded like the surface door. We’re locked in.\nKEVIN: We’re trapped down here?\nDOCTOR: There’s always a way out, Kevin. We just have to find it. After all, the air’s still flowing through the ventilation shaft —\nTEGAN: I don’t think it is, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Really? (WALKS TO VENTILATION SHAFT) You’re right! That could be a problem.\nCAITLIN: Forgive me, Doctor... But you seem to be enjoying this.\nTEGAN: He does that.\nDOCTOR: We’1ll work out how to open the doors.\nMATTHEW: But there could be half a dozen of them between us and the surface.\nDOCTOR: But only one between us and the TARDIS. Get through there, then a short locational hop and we’1ll be out of here in no time.\nCAITLIN: Now you’re just talking gibberish.\nDOCTOR: Most probably. Right then. Unfortunately I don’t have my toolbox with me, so I’1ll just have to make do with what’s in my pockets.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 29\nKEVIN: I’ve got a skeleton key.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. I think we might need something a little cleverer than that.\nCAITLIN: Maybe there’s still a way out down one of these other tunnels?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it, but you never know. Best to check all options.\nTEGAN: I’1l go with you.\nKEVIN: Me too.\nCAITLIN: Really, Kevin?\nKEVIN: Why not? I just don’t want to stand still when I could be doing something useful.\nCAITLIN: All right, but the Rucksack of Death stays here.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (TARDIS CORRIDOR)\nHARRIS: No good. It’s locked.\nANDREWS: So how do we get out?\nHARRIS: If the Bomb’s really gone off, I suggest we don’t bother.\nNYSSA: Bomb?\nSALLY: It’s possible that Armageddon has happened up there.\nANDREWS: I doubt it. There’s no sign of the PM, is there? It’s probably been triggered by mistake. There’s a radio over there, I’1l get on it and find out. Watch these two.\nTURLOUGH: So what did you do that got you into trouble, then?\nSALLY: I’m sorry? What?\nTURLOUGH: Just seems a rum job, I wondered what you’d done to get yourself stationed here.\nSALLY: Nothing, I volunteered for it.\nNYSSA: Volunteered?\nSALLY: Yes. I’ve worked under Clifford — Mr Andrews that is — before, when he took this post I asked to be considered for his PA.\nTURLOUGH: Really? But it’s a bit of a no-hoper isn’t it?\nSALLY: Oh and you’d know all about that, wouldn’t you? Look at your school uniform, the wing collar... What is it, Eton?\nTURLOUGH: Brendon, actually.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 31\nSALLY: School dorms and sons of presidents, I bet!\nTURLOUGH: Look, I don’t see what this has to do with —\nSALLY: I was born in London. The South West. It’s supposed to be the posh part, but there’s a lot of council estates there too. When I was sixteen I left school, a lot of us did. Most of the girls I knew got pregnant, ended up on the social and housing benefit. But not me.\nNYSSA: You didn’t like the... social?\nSALLY: No. I didn’t want to be one of the millions of unemployed. I worked my way up. Four years typing, delivering letters, making tea.. and then Mr Andrews sees me. Takes me under his wing. In one year I moved higher up the food chain than I did the first four combined. I’m twenty-one and I’m the peer of people almost double my age. And I did it without a degree or an ‘old school tie’. Because I volunteer for ‘rum old jobs’ like this.\nTURLOUGH: All right, consider me told. Although believe it or not, I’m not your usual kind of public schoolboy, either.\nNYSSA: How about you, Mr Harris?\nHARRIS: I was stationed here. Orders are orders.\nNYSSA: But you seem decked out for a full scale war! Grenades, assault rifle, pistol...\nSALLY: Major Harris here heard a few rumours about these tunnels before he came.\nHARRIS: They’re not rumours, I’ve seen them.\nSALLY: There may be something down here.\nHARRIS: I’ve seen them.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 32\nTURLOUGH: Seen what?\nHARRIS: Like people, but covered in patches of fur. They lumber around the tunnels...\nNYSSA: Don’t you think those might be responsible for the disappearances of your men, rather than us?\nHARRIS: They stay in the shadows. Don’t come close to us. I’ve never managed to catch one. I think someone’s helping them.\nNYSSA: And you haven't... er...\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, are you alright?\nNYSSA: What? Yes, sorry — it’s just that these corridors... they remind me of Hellheim. And the rat... Everywhere I go I seem to be looking at plague and corridors...\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (SOFT, IN NYSSA’S MIND) So much loss... All those people dying... family forgotten... How can you live like that...\nNYSSA: Did you hear that?\nHARRIS: Hear what?\nNYSSA: That voice?\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, are you all right? There was no voice.\nNYSSA: No... sorry.. I could have sworn that I heard.. No, it’s nothing.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (LOWER LEVELS)\nTEGAN: Are you sure we’re going the right way?\nCAITLIN: Kevin? What does the map say?\nKEVIN: It says there shouldn’t be a tunnel here at all.\nCAITLIN: I knew that thing would be useless.\nKEVIN: Not necessarily — maybe this tunnel is new.\nCAITLIN: It looks exactly as old as the others. Face it, you got sold a pup when you bought that thing.\nTEGAN: It doesn’t look like there’s any other way out. Let’s get back to the Doctor.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) So.. is this the sort of story you usually cover?\nCAITLIN: (WALKING) Not exactly. But then, this isn’t the sort of story that comes along every day.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) You know, on election day there are probably easier places to find a story.\nCAITLIN: (WALKING) What better day to do something like this? Everyone else is looking the other way.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) Fair point, I stand [corrected —]\nTEGAN: (STOPS) Did you hear that?\nCAITLIN: I’ve heard that before! Quick! This way! (STARTS RUNNING)\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 34\nKEVIN: (RUNNING) They’re following us! They’re getting closer!\nMUTOID: Muurrgghhh!!!\nTEGAN: (STOPPING) What the blazes is that!\nCAITLIN: It’s — a man! He’s hurt! He’s wearing some kind of fur coat?\nKEVIN: He’s not wearing it — it’s part of him! Look! His face!\nTEGAN: It’s some kind of giant man-rat!\nMUTOID: MuuRRRGGHHhhh!!!\nTEGAN: And he sounds hungry! Come on! Let’s get out of here!\nCAITLIN: (RUNNING) Which way! Left or right?\nKEVIN: (STOPPING AT SPEED) I don’t know! I can’t remember! Right! No — Left!\nTEGAN: Great one, Kev!

CADOGAN TUNNELS (TARDIS CORRIDOR)\nHARRIS: Do we know anything yet?\nANDREWS: No. I’ve managed to get a message out — someone should have picked it up — but nothing back yet.\nHARRIS: We need to get out of here.\nTURLOUGH: Agreed.\nNYSSA: If we can find [the Doctor —]\nSALLY: You’re giving up on your men?\nHARRIS: We need back-up. Something that can deal with those things.\nSALLY: I still haven’t seen any things.\nHARRIS: So you say. But it’s strange how my men have vanished and you two have been left alone.\nANDREWS: Don’t be ridiculous, Paul. (BEAT) Good grief, have you seen the size of this dead rat?\nNYSSA: Yes, I was just examining [it when —]\nHARRIS: How do know you’re telling the truth?\nSALLY: How do we know you’re telling the truth? You’ve been very quick to blame these disappearances on anyone you find — everyone from tunnel beasties to these two.\nHARRIS: What are you suggesting?\nSALLY: I’m suggesting you keep your theories to yourself and work on —\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 37\nTURLOUGH: What was that?\nHARRIS: Quiet, you.\nNYSSA: He’s right. There’s something in the shadows.\nANDREWS: Rats!\nNYSSA: No ordinary rats...\nSALLY: What’s happened to them?\nTURLOUGH: They’re enormous! And what’s that behind them? Is that... a man?\nMUTOID: Muurghhh!!!\nHARRIS: At last! Come to face me, have you?\nANDREWS: (OFF) Come on — this way!\nTURLOUGH: No! Into the TARDIS!\nANDREWS: (OFF) The what?\nTURLOUGH: The blue box! We’1ll be safe there.\nNYSSA: He’s right. Get us out of these cuffs.\nSALLY: I’m not sure —\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 38\nTURLOUGH: Well get sure, if you don’t want to die! Harris! Get back!\nMUTOID: Muurgghh!!!\nHARRIS: You want some? Take that!\nNYSSA: Harris, that thing isn’t the danger! It’s the rats! Don’t you see? It’s the rats!\nANDREWS: (OFF) There’s no way through here! Another of those blasted doors!\nHARRIS: Argh! There’s too many! Get them off me!\nTURLOUGH: Quick! Get inside!

(FX: DRAGGING STOOL) Here, sit on this stool.\nSALLY: (SITTING DOWN) Thank you, Turlough.\nNYSSA: I suppose you’re wondering how it’s bigger on the [inside than\nNYSSA: =]\nSALLY: Where do all these rooms go? This must be an entire annexe that’s not on the map! A totally different design, very modern... this must all have been added later. They didn’t tell us about this!\nNYSSA: Ah. No, you’re mistaken — this isn’t another part of the tunnels, it’s —\nTURLOUGH: (WARNING) Nyssa!\nNYSSA: We may as well be honest with her. (TO SALLY) This is how we got inside the tunnels. It’s our ship.\nSALLY: Good grief. But how [can it —]\nTURLOUGH: None of your business.\nNYSSA: Now, let’s look at this ankle —\nSALLY: Ow!\nNYSSA: sorry.\nSALLY: It’s okay, it just — ah — hurts when you do that.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 51\nNYSSA: Well, it looks like there’s no bones broken. It’s probably a sprain, or perhaps a severe bruising.\nTURLOUGH: Still, how is she going to be able to walk along these tunnels like that? Even we can’t keep our balance down here!\nNYSSA: She won’t. She’ll have to stay here, and you’1ll have to stay with her. (CLOSER) I don’t really want a stranger wandering\nNYSSA: around the TARDIS, and we can’t leave her sitting where the\nNYSSA: rats might find her.\nTURLOUGH: What about you?\nNYSSA: I'll take the toolbox, some torches and the radio. Here...\nNYSSA: I’ve tuned the communications array to the same frequency as this radio. You should be able to hear me if I call.\nTURLOUGH: Are you sure about this? I could go instead...\nNYSSA: I’ve had decades of experience crawling through tunnels just like this one, Turlough. I think I’1l be fine. I’11 be back as soon as I can. (WALKS OFF)\nSALLY: Is she going to be all right?\nTURLOUGH: I hope so. While we’re waiting — can I get you a cup of tea?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: INT.

Rrrgh!\nTEGAN: (WALKING) Will you get off me, Rat-man?!? I’m walking! I’m walking! Look, back off!\nTEGAN: (WALKING) Yeah, and you guys might want to call in a plumber. There’s water everywhere!\nKEVIN: (WALKING) What are they going to do with us, Tegan?\nTEGAN: (WALKING) I don’t know, Kevin.\nKEVIN: (WALKING) These things creep me out. They look like humans — but their eyes — there’s nothing in them! And what’s with the fur grafts?\nTEGAN: (WALKING) They’re like hybrid rat things. And these freaky giant rats seem to follow him around everywhere. Maybe they think he’s their leader, or something.\nKEVIN: (WALKING) We’re off the map now.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) I know. Where are we? That door looks more like something off a submarine.\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Be honoured. You are about to see royalty.\nTEGAN: (STUMBLING IN WATER) Argh! Did you hear that, Kev?\nKEVIN: Yeah... in my head. Can this guy read our minds?\nMUTOID: (WALKING) Whurrggh.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 53\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) (LAUGHS) No, not that pathetic thing. Us!\nKEVIN: What?\nTEGAN: The rats!\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) The mutoid obeys us. Not other way round. Do our heavy work. While we do the thinking.\nKEVIN: Telepathic rats? Oh god...\nTEGAN: That must be why their heads are so massive.\nKEVIN: What do you want with us?\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You will be done with as the King decides.\nKEVIN: (STOPPING IN THE WATER) The King?\nTEGAN: Something tells me he’s not talking about Elvis.\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Open the door.\nMUTOID: MurrGGHHHhh!!!\nTEGAN: (STUMBLING) Hey! I told you before about pushing! Okay! We’re walking! Jeez!\nTEGAN: Ah, that’s just great!

Are they... computers? They’re covered in filth! And what’s that smell?\nTEGAN: You ever smelt rat droppings before? Multiply that by a thousand. And then add whatever these giant morons do.\nKEVIN: (SPLASHING) So we’re walking through a rat toilet? Great. (BEAT) We’re dead, aren’t we. We’re going to die.\nTEGAN: Ah, not necessarily. (PAUSING) Look about, Kev — the rats are actually using the computers!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHICALLY) Rats good. Rats control everything.\nTEGAN: Who said — I mean thought that? Are you the — ewwww.\nKEVIN: Tegan?\nTEGAN: I think I found the boss.\nKEVIN: Where?\nTEGAN: Just look at that pile of filth in the middle of the water. See it? The wads of wet paper and the — well, whatever that is. See zie\nKEVIN: (REPULSED) It looks like a mountain of.. Ohhh, I think I’m gonna be — [sick!]\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 55\nTEGAN: Go for it. I doubt they’d even notice here. (TO KING RAT) Hey, fella — do you want some help with that?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHICALLY) Get back! Do not approach us!\nMUTOIDS: Wuurgghh...\nTEGAN: Hey, don’t ruffle your fur! It’s just, you and your mates seem to have your tails all knotted up and I thought someone with opposable thumbs might be able to help!\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHICALLY) This is the Rat King. They join their tails to join consciousness. It is what allows us to speak to you in this way.\nTEGAN: So what, while ratty there is all tied up, you can all speak?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHICALLY) Do not speak this way! Do not mock! You give respect!\nTEGAN: Well excuse me! You were the ones who abducted us, dragged us here! Maybe you should give us some respect first! Maybe you could start by telling us what’s going on! Who are you? What are you? What are they?\nMUTOID: Muurrgghhh...\nTEGAN: Rack off, ugly!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You wish to know? Then we tell. We control base. We control air, water, lights themselves. We control you. See this monitor? We watch your ‘Doctor’ try to work out what is\nKING RAT: done. We take you.

CADOGAN TUNNELS (CONNECTING CORRIDOR)\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) Where are we going, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) The main command centre. If I remember correctly, it should be just down here.\nANDREWS: (WALKING) ‘If you remember correctly’? You sound like you've been here before!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Well actually.. I have, but it was before your time.\nANDREWS: (STOPS) Before my time? Look at you — what are you, twelve? How do you know what before my time is? How many years are we talking here?\nDOCTOR: Well, if you really want to know... About forty.\nANDREWS: Forty.\nDOCTOR: Give or take. Now, if you have no more questions, we really need [to move on —]\nANDREWS: (WALKING) I do have more questions, as it happens. You still haven’t properly explained who you are. Either of you.\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) We came down here because we’d heard something strange was going on, and I think that’s been borne out, don’t you?\nANDREWS: And you just took it in your own hands to sort it out, did you?\nMATTHEW: I’ve never had a problem with taking direct action. We did it all the time back in my day.\nANDREWS: Don’t you start. At least you look old enough. Campus demonstrations, was it?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 57\nMATTHEW: And the rest.\nANDREWS: I’1l call up your file when I get back to the office. Might make interesting reading.\nDOCTOR: Mr Andrews, we are trying to help, and I think you need us.\nANDREWS: (WALKING) Maybe. Do we really need this dead rat though?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I want to get a look at what’s inside that rat. There’s more going on here than meets the eye!\nANDREWS: (WALKING) Great.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: Ah, here we are! The Cadogan Tunnels control room. In this very location Winston Churchill himself led Operation Daylight, you know.\nANDREWS: Very illuminating. Can I put this rat down now please?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, just put it down on that table. Matthew, help me clear these chairs so I can get to the master console.\nMATTHEW: Looks like they left in a hurry, Doctor, the furniture is all over the place.\nANDREWS: I thought we were trying to reach Sally and your friends?\nDOCTOR: We are, but I think we should restore the air supply first as a matter of priority.\nANDREWS: Air supply?\nDOCTOR: Yes, sorry, didn’t you know? We’re running out of air. That should do it. See if there’s anything from that vent up there, will you Matthew?\nMATTHEW: (CLIMBING ONTO A CHAIR) Can’t feel anything, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Hm. I somehow doubt that’s part of the lockdown strategy... so either something’s faulty, or...\nMATTHEW: It’s being done deliberately?\nANDREWS: Who by?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR: I don’t know...\nDOCTOR: There’s no power to this at all.\nANDREWS: But you said it was the master console.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And since the base is still functioning, control must have been transferred somewhere else. But where?\nMATTHEW: Maybe there’s something in one of these filing cabinets.\nANDREWS: You can’t go in there — there’s sensitive information —\nMATTHEWS: Well then you should have cleared it out earlier.\nANDREWS: We would have done if the soldiers hadn’t started disappearing.\nDOCTOR: I think I know what happened to your soldiers.\nANDREWS: Well they weren’t my soldiers, they were [just on —]\nDOCTOR: We found one of them, in the upper levels. Dead. And I think this is what killed him.\nANDREWS: The rat?\nDOCTOR: Well not necessarily this one, but one like it. Possibly several.\nANDREWS: They were trained men.\nDOCTOR: And these are more than just rats.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 60\nMATTHEW: Doctor! Look!\nDOCTOR: It’s a rough sketch out of the tunnels — but look — there are lower levels here! Quick, turn that table over.\nDOCTOR: Look! There’s a whole extra floor underneath everything that wasn’t on the earlier map! That’s where we need to go!\nMATTHEW: But how do we get down there?\nDOCTOR: There’s a lift shaft, there. Mr Andrews — we’re on the move again... (BEAT) Mr Andrews?\nMATTHEW: He’s gone!\nDOCTOR: Yes.. But the question is, where did he go?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (DEEPER LEVEL)\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Look, whoever you are... You’ve made your point. I’m here, I’m waiting... Tell me why you keep contacting me!\nNYSSA: (WALKING) You’re the one who contacted me! So come out, come out, wherever you are! Ahh!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) Do not fear me, Nyssa of Traken. I mean no harm. I want to converse.\nNYSSA: (STOPS) Telepathy! That would explain the metal additions and the enhanced cranium in that rat we found! Who are you? Who made you?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) I am Scientist Twenty Seven. I work on our biohazard vaccine. I have been trying to cure a deadly plague from hundreds of years ago, if released it would kill thousands of humans. And I need your help. You have seen something like this recently, yes?\nNYSSA: Richter’s Syndrome. Yes, well, I had a cure, but it destabilised. But why do you care about that? And why would you want to save the humans? The rats down here have done nothing but attack us!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) This is true. The rats want you to die. But I do not feel the same way. For decades your kind has experimented on us, cut us open, injected us, hidden deep in the tunnels, so deep that even the maps have forgotten us. Genetically advanced to genius level through decades of experimentation.\nNYSSA: You were test subjects?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) Generation after generation they worked on us, each one more advanced than the last. Each generation larger in Size, larger in intellect. But eventually we were too clever, and we overcame our captors, our torturers.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 62\nNYSSA: What happened to them?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) We — augmented — them.\nNYSSA: Those things, those humans! They were the scientists? But they were mindless, badly wounded — and the fur! That’s terrible!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) You look shocked, Nyssa. Do you not think that the person that did this to us should be punished? That killed our parents, experimented on our families should face judgement?\nNYSSA: I — I don’t think there’s ever a case for such response.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) Really? Not even the Master? A man who stole your own father’s body? Who killed your step mother? You didn’t want vengeance? Your memories state otherwise.\nNYSSA: Stay out of my memories. Look, I’m not here to judge you. I’m here because you said you can help me. How can you give me the cure to Richter’s Syndrome? And what do I have to do to get it?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) The King Rat wants to use a virus to kill many humans, so that we can return to the surface as rulers. I want you to help me find an alternative. Something that would control the humans, make them docile, placid, but still live.\nNYSSA: Why would I do this?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) Because our work may help you with yours. Your virus is destabilising, yes? So did ours. But we developed a biotropic enzyme that helped slow this, one that may help you.\nNYSSA: So.. to save billions, I have to condemn all of Earth?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) No, we want life in peace. Have hidden down here too long, afraid of humans coming and wiping us out. We will talking with humans, ask for land to live, to breed in. Virus is just a bargaining chip.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 63\nNYSSA: Nobody would be hurt? You swear? But won’t the rats be suspicious? A human, helping you?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHICALLY) You think you’re the first human to work for uS...?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (ELSEWHERE)\nCAITLIN: (HALF-SOBBING) What am I doing here? What am I looking for? Why did I —\nCAITLIN: (TERRIFIED WHISPER) Oh no... oh, please no... Don’t let them get me...\nANDREWS: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) No-one’s getting anyone, young lady.\nCAITLIN: A person! A real, live person! Oh, thank you, thank you! .. The rats, they attacked us! They had these terrible humanoid guards that took Kevin and Tegan!\nANDREWS: Who are Kevin and Tegan? Are they with the other two — the Doctor and Matthew?\nCAITLIN: Yes! Where are they? We need to tell them!\nANDREWS: Follow that tunnel for about a hundred yards, turn left, go up the steps, follow the right hand tunnel until you reach them.\nCAITLIN: What about you? We should all stay together.\nANDREWS: I’m going to see if my superiors got my message and what the Situation is. The Doctor seems all for going deeper in.\nCAITLIN: Why?\nANDREWS: Look, go ask him. He enjoys the sound of his own voice, I’m sure he’d love to tell you. (BEAT) The rats took them, you say? They didn’t kill them?\nCAITLIN: Definitely.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 65\nANDREWS: We’ll see about that. I’1l be sure to tell them you’re down\nANDREWS: here.

THE LAIR OF THE KING RAT.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WATER, DRIPPING, RAT UNDERBUZZ, SPARKING WIRES, AN ORGANIC HUM)\nTEGAN: You can’t be serious! You’re flamin’ mad!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Thirty years we sit here, in darkness, forgotten. Breeding, enhancing, evolving. Soon we are too many for tunnels. Must find larger domains. Why not on land?\nTEGAN: But a plague? Come on! That’s overkill on a massive scale!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) We will keep many of you alive. But there must be sacrifice. Only strong, loyal will be given cure to the plague.\nTEGAN: It won’t happen! We’1ll stop you! The Doctor will find out and he’ll end this!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Doctor is not threat. Our interest in him lessens. And we now have new toys to play with. (TO MUTOID) Take soldier human out of treadmill. We will eat his body later.\nKEVIN: Treadmill?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Yes, once we were placed in them. We would run and run until we were too tired to. We made one for humans. (TO MUTOID) Treadmill powers us. Gives light. Faster you run, more power we have. Slower — and bad happens.\nKEVIN: So when we turned the lights on up there...\nKING RAT: Soldier human had to run faster, yes. Thought he would last longer. Disappointing. Now you will go in treadmill.\nMUTOID: Murrghhh!!!\nKEVIN: (DRAGGED THROUGH WATER) Help me! No! Get away!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: KEVIN IS THROWN INTO THE TREADMILL CAGE AND THE DOOR IS\nSLAMMED: SHUT)\nTEGAN: Bad happens? What ‘bad’ happens?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Nothing, if runs. When stop, even for moment, electric shock in spine. He run again. More power.\nTEGAN: And if he’s too tired to continue?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Then he stops. And shocks will keep striking. He will die.\nTEGAN: That’s inhuman!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Thank you.\nKING RAT: (FX: UNDERLYING BACKGROUND OF KEVIN RUNNING, WITH OCCASIONAL SHOCK)\nTEGAN: And me? You gonna throw me in a maze or something? Make me squeak for some cheese?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) No. You interest us. You have strange memories, the snake.\nTEGAN: Snake?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Snake in your mind.\nTEGAN: The Mara?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Yes. You are not of this world, though born here. We would learn more. Are there more like you?\nTEGAN: Why, are you afraid of me?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 68\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) No. Make you like others. Human with rat mind.\nTEGAN: Wait! You mean to make me like these men? Brain dead and furry? No!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You will not care when done. You will be... complacent. Guards? Take her to cell. Prepare experiment room for conversion operation. Soon she will be rat hybrid!

Wake up.\nSALLY: (WAKING) Wurgh... I’m sorry, I must have nodded off... Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Stay very still.\nSALLY: What is it?\nTURLOUGH: The TARDIS door mustn’t have closed properly after Nyssa left. While you slept... we have visitors.\nSALLY: Where?\nTURLOUGH: Other side of the console, in the corner. Three rats, watching us. Can you stand? Do it slowly, that’s the ticket... Here, I brought this.\nSALLY: A cup of tea?\nSALLY: (FX: THE CLATTER OF A BROOM BEING PULLED SLOWLY ACROSS THE FLOOR)\nTURLOUGH: No, I meant the broom. Something to use as a crutch.\nSALLY: Okay... argh... I’m all right. It’s just sore.\nTURLOUGH: Now slowly back away behind me towards the door...\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING) Quickly! They’re moving!\nRAT: SKREEEE! !!\nTURLOUGH: Get back!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 70\nRAT: (IN PAIN) SKKREEEEEEE!!!\nTURLOUGH: (OPENING DOOR) Quick! Move! Shut the door!\nTURLOUGH: sorry.\nSALLY: Sorry? For what?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING OFF) For spilling your tea. Come on, they’1ll probably work out how to open that door soon. We need to gain a head start. And find some proper weapons.\nSALLY: (WALKING) Like a gun?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) No, the TARDIS doesn’t allow weapons to be fired in it. It’s called a ‘temporal grace’ or something. We’1ll have to find a way to work around it.\nSALLY: (WALKING) Weapons don’t work in here? What are you talking about?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t really understand it myself.\nSALLY: What about giant rats tearing off your face? Does that count as a ‘weapon’?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) I think we should assume not. Come on, this way.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (DEEPER LEVEL)\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WE’RE IN THE DRIPPY, ECHO-Y TUNNELS NOW. DOCTOR AND\nMATTHEW: CLAMBER DOWN A LIFT SHAFT ON A ROPE. )\nDOCTOR: Safely down?\nMATTHEW: I think so. Yes. Are you sure about this, Doctor? These tunnels don’t look as secure as the others.\nDOCTOR: The walls are rougher down here — more like a mine shaft than a wartime bunker. And you’re looking at them as if you expect something to burst out from them.\nMATTHEW: I’m sorry. It’s — they’re just stories. I’m looking for bones in the walls.\nDOCTOR: Bones? Why would there be... ah. The Cadogan plague pits, am I right?\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) Yes. The Black Death. Fourteenth Century. There was a large outbreak in Cadogan Castle shortly before the end. The stories say they dug giant plague pits deep into the ground to bury the masses of dead.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) And the burial grounds were right here, yes?\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) In the late sixties there was supposed to be a shopping centre built on Grant’s Field, just down the road. I heard that as they dug into the ground to build the foundations, they found bodies. Plague victims. They’d accidentally dug into one of the burial pits.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Yes, I can see how that might not go down well.\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) But there’s more. The government sent scientists to check the bodies. And they discovered that the plague? It was still there, in the bones. And it had mutated.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) What happened?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 72\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) They ordered the ground be concreted over. They built the shopping centre on the other side of town, on a nature reserve. I went on a protest sit-in. Didn’t do any good.\nDOCTOR: (PAUSES) But how does that relate to these tunnels?\nMATTHEW: Well, the rumour is that when these first tunnels were built in the sixteenth century, they also caught a plague pit — but they just sealed up the hole and worked around it. But then, after the discovery, a construction team was seen coming into these — supposedly abandoned — tunnels.\nDOCTOR: Let me guess. The favourite theory is that the government, realising that the plague was literally next door, decided to have a look at it.\nMATTHEW: Exactly! Everyone knows that the next big thing is going to be germ warfare. If they could limit its range...\nDOCTOR: And that’s why you believe these tunnels aren’t on the map?\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) Well, I didn’t know really what we’d find, but with the place being given to English Heritage soon, I knew any evidence would be removed. Look! There!\nDOCTOR: (MOVING TO THE WALL) Bring the light over, Matthew — I can’t see properly — good lord! It’s a hand! Well, what was once a hand, anyway. Now it’s just bones.\nMATTHEW: (BACKING AWAY) A plague victim?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so, Matthew. It’s wearing a wristwatch. This body was dumped here during the excavation. What I want to know is why?\nMATTHEW: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Turn the light off! It might be — No, wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 73\nCAITLIN: (ENTERING) Matthew! Doctor! Oh, thank god!\nDOCTOR: Miss Jones! What are you doing down here!\nCAITLIN: I followed your voices. I found your rope down the lift shaft.\nMATTHEW: Where are Kevin and Tegan?\nCAITLIN: I’m sorry... I’m so sorry. But they were taken by the rats!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. TARDIS CORRIDORS\nSALLY: (WALKING) Where are we going, Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) My bedroom, actually.\nSALLY: (WALKING) Well that’s quite forward!\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) No, not that. I have something there that might help us. An item I picked up on another... well, let’s just say I picked it up on my travels. A place called ‘Purity’.\nSALLY: (WALKING) What is it?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) It’s a ‘sparkwire’ — a slightly more advanced defibrillator, essentially.\nSALLY: (WALKING) You mean those things that hospitals use to restart hearts?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) Yes, but it’s been tampered with. It’1ll shoot a charge — as it’s a medical device, I’m hoping the TARDIS might overlook it.\nSALLY: That’s not very reassuring.\nTURLOUGH: It gets less reassuring, believe me. There’s probably enough power for three small charges — or one large one. With luck, we’ll be able to knock out each of the rats before they can get close. But we’ll have to be careful.\nSALLY: (WALKING) Why?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) Because if we do it wrong, it’ll use all the energy at once. And that’s enough to kill either of us.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS.

Is there someone else in here?\nWALLACE: (WALKING) You’re.. real! You’re not a... dream?\nTEGAN: I hope so! Who’s that? Come out of the shadows.\nWALLACE: I’m sorry... it’s been so long since I spoke to a human being...\nTEGAN: Good god! What happened to you? Those burns... those scars! The fur —You’re one of them! One of those human rats!\nWALLACE: No, my mind is still my own, though I wonder if that’s a mixed blessing. As for my body? The rats... they like to play with me, torture me.\nTEGAN: Play with you? It looks like they’re trying to kill you!\nWALLACE: No, they want me alive, for as long as they can. They want me to see the world when they have finished with it.\nTEGAN: But why?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 76\nWALLACE: Because my name is Doctor Christopher Wallace... And I created them!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (DEEPER LEVEL)\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Come on! We haven’t a moment to lose!\nMATTHEW: (RUNNING) What about the lockdown? How do we get out?\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) I’m sorry, Matthew, but Tegan and Kevin’s safety is far more important than finding a way out for the moment!\nCAITLIN: And maybe that other bloke will get some help.\nDOCTOR: Mr Andrews? Maybe, but I wouldn’t bank on it.\nMATTHEW: (RUNNING) But Doctor! We don’t know where Kevin and Tegan are, even! They could be anywhere! Now what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (TUTS) These batteries are going.\nCAITLIN: Is that Kevin’s rucksack you’ve got? There should be spares in there.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nDOCTOR: Shine your torch in here, Matthew.\nCAITLIN: Be careful, Doctor — There’s Nitro in there.\nDOCTOR: No there isn’t — I left it back in the tunnel where you last saw us, under a crate, safely out of the way. Remind me to go and dispose of it properly before we leave... Batteries, batteries.. compass, no.. Dog whistle?\nCAITLIN: In case there were security dogs. It was Kevin’s idea.\nDOCTOR: You know that dog whistles call dogs to you? Not send them away?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 78\nCAITLIN: You met Kevin. What do you think?\nDOCTOR: Fair point. Ah! Batteries.\nDOCTOR: Now —\nCAITLIN: Doctor! It’s the rats! Look! They’re the ones who took Tegan!\nDOCTOR: Yes, it looks like they want to see what we’re doing. Slowly back away, Caitlin — we can go around them —\nMUTOID: Wurrghhh!!!\nMATTHEW: Argh! What the hell is that!\nDOCTOR: I think it was human... but as for what it is...\nCAITLIN: Whatever it is, it’s strong.\nMATTHEW: (INTERRUPTING) Doctor! Rats — behind us!\nDOCTOR: Ah. That’s inconvenient. (LOUDLY) Hello, I’m the Doctor. Who’s the leader here?\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) I am, Doctor. Security Rat Seven.\nDOCTOR: Telepathic communication! Marvellous way to bypass those limited little squeaky vocal cords. Now look, we don’t want to be a nuisance, but I believe that you have two of our friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 79\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) They have been taken for conversion. Our hybrids\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: are old. New humans must replace the old.\nDOCTOR: I don’t like the sound of that.\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You have been deemed a threat, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Have I? Always nice to be recognised.\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You will be eradicated. Your humans will be converted.\nMATTHEW: Converted to one of those? You mean you made them?\nCAITLIN: Did you do that to everyone you found down here?\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) No. Some of them we killed.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t come closer! I have nitro glycerine in this bag! move and boom!\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) I do not believe you.\nCAITLIN: (MURMURING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) Don’t worry, I’ve been in tighter spots than this\nDOCTOR: One\nDOCTOR: before. All I need to do is to keep them talking while I work\nDOCTOR: out a plan.\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) The time for talking is over, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Ah. Forgot how well rats can hear. (TO RATS) Look, if we could\nDOCTOR: only discuss this...\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Soldiers! Attack! Kill the Doctor and his allies!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL)\nMUTOID: WurrGGHHHH!!!\nMUTOID: END OF PART TWO\nMUTOID: Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 81"

Continue —\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) I really think that you should reconsider! This isn’t just a whistle — it’s a hypersonic dog whistle! If I blew on this, the pitch would be too high for us to hear... But for you...\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) What about us?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen your enhancements. The small metal plate in your skull? A transcendal wavelength receiver. Your telepathy is nothing more than a communal wavelength broadcast, controlled by a central location!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 82\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) What does this mean to us?\nDOCTOR: The wavelength that connects you is the same one as this whistle. One blow and it’1ll sever your hive mind! We won’t hear it, but you’ll suffer the intense pain of cerebral feedback. If it doesn’t kill you, it’1ll drive you mad with pain.\nSECURITY RAT SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) (BEAT) Not believe you.\nDOCTOR: Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

If they come through, just blow the whistle again.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: I would, if it actually worked.\nCAITLIN: You lied?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just say that I... exaggerated a little. Those metal plates in the skull were designed for hive communication, but I have no idea where their telepathy came from. The theory’s sound, I think, but I’d need something more powerful and directed to make it work.\nCAITLIN: Hold on — why couldn’t they tell that you were lying? I mean, if they’re telepathic...\nDOCTOR: Psychic defences. I’ve kept out better mind-readers than them in my time. I realised when I threatened them with the explosives. They said they didn’t believe me... but they didn’t actually know.\nMATTHEW: Psychic rats.. how is that possible?\nDOCTOR: Matthew, the list of the impossible is growing every additional minute we stay down here. Those rats aren’t naturally evolved — the amount of proteins that would have to be mixed together to create such a hybrid, not to mention the surgery...\nCAITLIN: Someone did this to them?\nDOCTOR: It certainly looks that way. There might be a lot of rats down here, but there’s definitely a pied piper playing the tune somewhere in all this. The trouble is, what if the rats have learned the tune for themselves?\nDOCTOR: Come on, down here. Wherever those rats took Tegan and Kevin, I’m sure it’s downward.

Keep the human to the designated areas.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Of course. Come with me, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Does the Rat King really know about me?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) (WALKING) Of course not. They would want you for experimenting, breeding even. My virus suggestion is irrelevant to them.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Breeding?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Of course. More humans equals more specimens, more hybrid soldiers. Why look so shocked, Nyssa of Traken? Your kind has done the same to us for centuries. Come, my bench is this way...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS. THE CELL.\nWALLACE: It was supposed to be the dawn of a new age.\nTEGAN: A new age of warfare, you mean.\nWALLACE: Many of our greatest achievements came, came from warfare, you know. Airplanes during world war one, yes, Radar and satellite technology in world war two — Haha! Even Silly Putty — that’s right, Silly Putty came from such a thing.\nTEGAN: Look, you need to sit down — you don’t look so good.\nWALLACE: Silly Putty!\nTEGAN: Yes. Silly Putty. Look, are you saying that war is good?\nWALLACE: Of course not! But war, it pushes forward technology. And in the fifties, with a terrible war right behind us...\nTEGAN: Yeah, you really look like you’ve put it behind you.\nWALLACE: And we were preparing for the next one.\nTEGAN: Why?\nWALLACE: Twenty years between world war one and two? We assumed that in the sixties, it’d begin all over again, just in time for the next generation to forget the mistakes of the last.\nTEGAN: But the war didn’t come, did it? Well, not in the way you expected? It was a secret war. The Cold War.\nWALLACE: (PACING) Exactly. Russia became the threat, and we needed to know what their plans were. Spies became our front lines. Information became our ammunition.\nTEGAN: But what does this have to do with rats? Because let’s face it, everything else can wait for the moment.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 89\nWALLACE: We had an idea. An idea! To create spies that would never be considered. A rat in a building? A pest! But they’re clever animals — what if that rat could hear, see what was happening, disseminate the information, bring it back? The ultimate secret agent!\nTEGAN: If I hadn’t seen it out there, I’d say you were mad.\nWALLACE: I made a cocktail of amino acids and proteins and synthetic strings that, when injected made a radical advancement in rat genetics. And as the rats progressed, so did our ideas. A receiver dish to allow new orders to be sent remotely. Larger Size of the rat itself, to ensure survival against things like guard dogs...\nTEGAN: Let me guess, it all went wrong. But if they took over and made you the prisoner, what happened to the others?\nWALLACE: The rats’ humanoid servants. That’s all that’s left of my team. The rats had spent years watching what we did. They faked an accident — cleared the base of non-important personnel. The tunnels were closed and the humans waited for the air to clear. By the time it did, the rats had changed things, removed all knowledge of my project and the lower levels. They’d sealed it off, and anyone who knew about it had been captured, kept.\nTEGAN: But surely the government would have known?\nWALLACE: Oh, they did. But they believed that the lower levels were caved in, and that a plague pit had been opened up. Don’t want to play in a plague pit, no no. We were probably dead anyway, tell the families we died in an accident. Not worth the risk to come down here and check. Our work was so secret, even they didn’t know what it was half the time.\nTEGAN: How long has this been going on?\nWALLACE: Close to twenty years. My wife, my daughter, think I am dead.\nTEGAN: You’ve never tried to get out?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 90\nWALLACE: I always thought it was for the best that I stay. I don’t want people to see me, know the mistakes I made... I made a lot you know. The rats, they enjoy reminding me of my mistakes... But now, with the tunnels being sold they want to leave, get out before it’s too late. They’re creating a virus to kill any humans that get in their way — and they’1ll have it ready any day now. I must get out and warn someone — but I can’t do it alone.\nTEGAN: I’1ll help. Can you run?\nWALLACE: I’1l damn well sprint if I have to.\nTEGAN: Good. Now, here’s the plan...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (DEEPER LEVEL).\nCAITLIN: (WALKING) It’s like a sewer down here.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Yes, it looks like there was a cave-in at some point — here, watch your footing on these steps, the top one is loose.\nMATTHEW: (WALKING) What I’d give if that was the only problem down here, eh! I mean —\nCAITLIN: (STOPPING) Matthew! Are you all right?\nMATTHEW: (OFF) Yes, don’t worry, I’m fine. Just a few cuts and —\nDOCTOR: Look out, Matthew! The ground —\nMATTHEW: (OFF) Whoa — aaarrgh!\nCAITLIN: Matthew!\nDOCTOR: Get me a rope. I need to get down there.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS, RAT LABORATORY\nNYSSA: What was that?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) I do not know. I fear the Doctor is trying to rescue his friend. This will force the Rat King to move ahead with the plague. We must work fast.\nNYSSA: Why not just let Tegan go? She’s nothing to do with this.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) We will free her — after we have created this new compound. Now, what do you need?\nNYSSA: But Tegan —\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) What would you rather do? Free your friend, or find a cure for your Richter’s Disease?\nNYSSA: I.. you're right. I have to think of the many over the one. I need to see the enzyme that you claim stopped the destabilisation of your compound. I’1ll also need something I can use to draw some of my own blood to test it against.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Scientist Twenty Seven.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Technician Fifteen. What can I do for you?\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Rat King sent me to bring the plague.\nRAT SCIENTIST: Why?\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) They wish to bring launch forwards. Latest batch will be tested on new woman.\nNYSSA: Tegan?\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 93\nNYSSA: But they can’t!\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) And why not?\nNYSSA: She’s.. she’s been travelling with me! We’re time travellers!\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Your human is mad, Scientist Twenty Seven.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Read her memories. She has been to other worlds and times.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) If I believe you, human — why can’t this compound be used?\nNYSSA: The temporal flux — it takes at least five hours for the body to settle and behave normally. Before then, you won’t get a reliable result.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) I see. Then we will wait. Thank you.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS (SECRET LEVEL)\nDOCTOR: Don’t come too close to the edge, Caitlin — that might give way too.\nCAITLIN: (OFF) Can you see him, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m just looking for a safe footing...\nDOCTOR: Matthew? Matthew...\nCAITLIN: (OFF) Is he all right?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) I’m sorry, Caitlin. The rocks came down on him, crushed him. He’s dead.\nCAITLIN: What? But he can’t be. Have you checked —\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. He’s gone.\nCAITLIN: He only came because of his stupid mid-life crisis... he felt like he’d sold out, joined the establishment... Are you coming back up?\nDOCTOR: No, I think you should come down.\nCAITLIN: Why?\nDOCTOR: There’s a whole new level down here. This must be where Tegan and Kevin were taken.\nCAITLIN: But Matthew...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR: Matthew would have wanted us to save them. Come on, I’1l help you down.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS, RAT CELL\nTEGAN: Guard! Quickly! I think the old man is having some kind of attack!\nWALLACE: Ohhh! My heart!\nMUTOID: Wuurggh!!\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Get back! Get away from the door!\nWALLACE: Now, Tegan!\nTEGAN: Hey, rat — what am I thinking?\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Argh! The snake! Hide! Hide from the snake!\nTEGAN: Quick! While he chases his tail!\nWALLACE: Hehe! Rats in a trap! What if there’s more guards?\nTEGAN: They’1l get more of the same.\nWALLACE: What do you think of? To make them do that?\nTEGAN: Something else got in my head once. Something powerful, a sort of snake. I just remember what that was like, and they think it’s in their heads. Snakes and rats, not great pals of course. This memory of the Mara seems to do well if we meet any.\nWALLACE: That’s very clever.\nTEGAN: Thanks. Come on, this way!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44: INT. TARDIS CORRIDOR\nTURLOUGH: (RUNNING) Come on, Sally! They’re getting closer again!\nTURLOUGH: (PAUSES) Maybe we should try to talk to them?\nSALLY: Do you remember what they did to Harris, Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Maybe not, then. Here, lean against this wall. If they come close, use the broom handle as a weapon.\nSALLY: And what will you be doing? Where are you going?\nTURLOUGH: (OPENS A DOOR) There’s an archon feed to the time vortex here — it’s fiddly, but I should be able to rig up a quick charge for the sparkwire.\nSALLY: And then what? They won’t stop coming!\nTURLOUGH: True — but if they see one of their own get shocked, they might take him away for medical attention, or even give up and leave.\nSALLY: They’re giant rats, Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: Intelligent giant rats. And we have to hope that the intelligence part overcomes the whole ‘bite first, ask questions later’ part. Back ina bit.\nSALLY: Turlough? Turlough!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: INT. SECRET CADOGAN TUNNELS, DIARY ROOM\nDOCTOR: Hnnf — There!\nCAITLIN: (ENTERING THE ROOM) Where are we, Doctor? It looks like nobody’s been around here in decades.\nDOCTOR: During the war, this was a radar station, although latterly it seems to have been used as a dumping ground for old tapes and files.. help me shift these.\nCAITLIN: What for?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been thinking about the ruse with the dog whistle. The device needs to be significantly stronger.\nCAITLIN: You want a bigger dog whistle.\nDOCTOR: In a nutshell, yes. I should be able to cannibalise the radar for the parts I need.\nCAITLIN: What, and just knock up a gadget just like that?\nDOCTOR: Trust me, Caitlin — this isn’t my first time doing something like this.\nCAITLIN: Doctor... look at this tape! ‘Nineteen Fifty Eight, Doctor Wallace Personal Diary’.\nDOCTOR: I don’t see the relevance —\nCAITLIN: Please, Doctor — I need to hear this. Is that a tape player?\nDOCTOR: A reel-to-reel recorder. If it still works —\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR: (COUGH) I wonder how long it’s been since this one’s been\nDOCTOR: played.\nCAITLIN: Why? What’s on it?\nDOCTOR: The Goon Show. Pass me your reel.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS, AWAY FROM CELLS\nWALLACE: (RUNNING) They know we’ve escaped!\nTEGAN: (RUNNING) Then we’d better make every second count. This way, Wallace.\nWALLACE: (STOPPING) But we can’t just leave — we have to stop them!\nTEGAN: We need to find the Doctor before we can think about stopping them. Our chances are a hell of a lot better with him.\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) Come on! Which way!\nWALLACE: It’s been so long... I can’t remember...\nANDREWS: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) I’d say you need to go that way.\nTEGAN: Who are you?\nANDREWS: Someone who can help you find the Doctor.\nTEGAN: You’ve met the Doctor?\nANDREWS: Yes, and I know where he is. Quick, we need to get out of here and fast — there’s a staircase down that corridor that takes us to the upper dormitory.\nTEGAN: (WALKING) That’1ll do for me! Come on, Wallace! We need to —\nWALLACE: (INTERRUPTING) No. It’s a trap.\nTEGAN: (STOPPING) What?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 101\nWALLACE: That escape route, it’s a trap. It’ll take us right back to the rats.\nANDREWS: And why would I do that?\nWALLACE: Because you work for them, Mr Andrews. I’ve seen you. You might have thought I was unconscious, or too in pain to understand, but I saw you. And that woman of yours. Talking to the Rat King. You sold us out, a rat in every sense.\nANDREWS: (FX: COCKS PISTOL) Ah.\nTEGAN: The pistol tells me it’s true.\nANDREWS: I’m afraid so. Now — be a good girl and do exactly what I tell you.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. SECRET CADOGAN TUNNELS, DIARY ROOM\nWALLACE: (D) The aim of Project Piper is to create a breed of hyper- intelligent rats for use in chemical warfare, using a variety of hypertension proteins and a continual regime of radical shock therapy to create a non-epileptic super-breed.\nCAITLIN: Doctor Christopher Wallace...\nDOCTOR: Does that name mean something to you?\nWALLACE: (D) Here, we plan to create a hive mind by linking together three enhanced rats by their tails to create a King Rat, a communications hub if you will for a genetically achieved super-rat hive mind.\nDOCTOR: That’s how the rats were created!\nWALLACE: (D) Each hive rat will have a transcended wavelength receiver surgically implanted in their frontal lobe, allowing them to communicate via wavelength broadcast, controlled by a central location.\nDOCTOR: Thought as much.\nCAITLIN: But we don’t have those plates in our skulls, and we understand them.\nDOCTOR: No. The rats have clearly been working on it.\nWALLACE: (D) (SIGHS) It is hard sometimes. I know they’re only rats. I don’t care about that. But to keep this all so secret, to not even be able to tell my wife and daughter what I do every day can be rather —\nWALLACE: (FX: STATIC WIPE AS ANOTHER RECORDING CUTS IN, RECORDED OVER THE DIARY ENTRY)\nWALLACE: (D) June the fifteenth. I’m currently opening up the frontal lobe of specimen fifteen...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 103\nWALLACE: (VIA TAPE RECORDER) Can you pass me the transducer? Thank you. And the receiver?\nWALLACE: Excellent. Now, if you can pass me the soldering iron? We’1l cauterise the wound — no need to waste time stitching —\nCAITLIN: Why’s it stopped?\nDOCTOR: Old tape, I’m afraid. The recorder’s chewed it up.\nCAITLIN: He did all that? Doctor Wallace?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes people just lose sight of things when they focus on a project. I’ve been guilty of it myself... Are you all right?\nCAITLIN: (CRYING) We never knew exactly what it was he did down here. But to hear all that.. To hear the proof that your own father was a monster...\nDOCTOR: You’re his daughter?\nCAITLIN: (DRYING HER EYES) Yes. My name isn’t Caitlin Jones, it’s Caitlin Wallace. Christopher Wallace was my father — and he died in an accident down here almost twenty years ago. Or that’s what they told us...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS, RAT LABORATORY\nNYSSA: (LOW) Kevin! Can you hear me? Are you all right? Where are the rats?\nKEVIN: (WALKING) What do you want, traitor?\nNYSSA: To tell you I’m not a traitor. The scientist rat? He’s not like the others — he wants to help us. I’m making sure that this plague of theirs never works. I’m saving you!\nKEVIN: (WALKING) Yeah? Then open this cage. Otherwise, it looks to me like you’re saving yourself.\nNYSSA: Just keep walking for a little while longer. And trust me! I need to get back to the desk!\nKEVIN: (WALKING) Whatever. Go play with your rat chums.\nKEVIN: (FX: NYSSA WALKS CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WATER. RAT STEPS FROM\nSHADOWS: )\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Why are you not at your desk, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) I — I needed a break, Scientist Twenty Seven.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Then let me walk with you back to your desk. How are you proceeding?\nNYSSA: (WALKING) Much better since they stopped the alarms. What was that?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Your human friend escaped the cells.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) She did? Oh.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) No need to hide your happiness. I was hesitant of\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: testing the plague on her. Hopefully your help will give us a different solution.\nNYSSA: (WALKING) The design of the base compound is very interesting — I’ve seen similar in Richters Syndrome victims. (STOPS) Here, look — I’m comparing the antibodies in my blood to this to see what will happen.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Very good. And the new virus? The one to make the humans docile?\nNYSSA: I’m working on it. I found a compound in your stores which might be useful in that, but I wanted [to check —]\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) (INTERRUPTING) Give that to me! Carefully — do not drop it!\nNYSSA: Why? Is it the plague?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Give it to me!\nNYSSA: What is it?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You do not need to know. I must speak to the Rat King. Keep working!\nNYSSA: I will. (TO HERSELF) Yes, I will...\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT. SECRET CADOGAN TUNNELS, DIARY ROOM\nCAITLIN: My mother always thought there was something more to Dad’s death, though she never talked to me about it. She knew he hadn’t told the truth about his work, but she wanted to protect me. When I looked into it and discovered the rumours for myself\nDOCTOR: What rumours?\nCAITLIN: Seems they were more than just rumours. I heard he was a Doctor Mengele, that he experimented on animals to make monsters for the military. That he wasn’t really dead, he’d gone on the run for war crimes. I wish I’d left it alone.\nDOCTOR: So you came here to find out the truth?\nCAITLIN: I had to. The Ministry of Defence wouldn’t even take my calls. I don’t know what I hoped I’d find. The more I went into it, the more likely it seemed everything I’d heard was true.\nCAITLIN: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. I think they’ve discovered our arrival. Which means I need to work fast.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. TARDIS CORRIDORS\nSALLY: Where’ve you been, Turlough? I thought you were dead!\nTURLOUGH: Charging up this Sparkwire. The jury rig didn’t last long, but I have about four charges worth in here. Four charges, three rats. Should be fine.\nSALLY: Good, because they’re coming!\nTURLOUGH: Just in time then.\nTURLOUGH: Get back. I’m warning you.\nSALLY: Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: Right!\nSALLY: Direct hit!\nTURLOUGH: Seems to be giving them pause for thought. Here, take the sparkwire. Switch to the left for a small charge, switch to the right if.. well, if there’s no other choice. But we won’t have time to recharge it again.\nSALLY: What about you? If I have the weapon —\nTURLOUGH: (PICKING SOMETHING UP OFF THE FLOOR) I’11 make do with the broom. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 108\nSALLY: (WALKING WITH A LIMP) Where to now?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) I have a plan. If we keep going this way, we should loop around and get to the console room before them.\nSALLY: (WALKING WITH A LIMP) And then?\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING) I don’t like to think that far ahead.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. CADOGAN TUNNELS. THE KING RAT’S LAIR\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Rat King! The humans have escaped!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) We know. Find them.\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) The Doctor is still missing!\nRAT KING: (TELEPATHIC) Time to remove problems. Find Doctor and friend and kill them. Find woman and Wallace - kill them too!\nGUARD RAT: (TELEPATHIC) And the boy? Should I tell the rats to attack?\nRAT KING: (TELEPATHIC) No — we have better assassin there. This test! Pass her message — kill Turlough!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. TARDIS CORRIDOR\nTURLOUGH: (WALKING SLOWLY) They’re still following. Probably trying to goad us into discharging the sparkwire, wasting the charges.\nSALLY: Maybe.\nTURLOUGH: So if we try to make a right along this corridor... Sally? Your twisted ankle suddenly seems better.\nSALLY: I never had a sprained ankle. It was purely to slow you down.\nTURLOUGH: So the rats could keep up with us and watch us. What were their orders, to wait for you to act? You let them in while I was making the tea, didn’t you?\nSALLY: I’ve always said public schools are full of idiots. You gave me the only weapon, showed me how to use it to kill you.\nTURLOUGH: So you and Andrews were with the rats from the start?\nSALLY: It’s survival, that’s all. They’ve drawn dozens of people down here for their experiments.\nTURLOUGH: What experiments?\nSALLY: To see how we react to danger, distress... death.. Most of the Survivors are used to test viruses and so on. Andrews and me are the only ones they’ve kept. I even have a rat transmitter in my skull, anything to keep them trusting me, anything that stops them turning me into one of those brain dead hybrids. When the rats decimate the planet, we will be spared, because we know our place in the new world.\nTURLOUGH: On all fours and begging for scraps. I hope you like cheese, Miss Lucas. Your boss Andrews as well.\nSALLY: (LAUGHS) Andrews isn’t my boss any more. He wouldn’t agree to the transmitter. That made me the Rat King’s favourite servant.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 111\nTURLOUGH: Then why the charade with us?\nSALLY: Did you see how Harris talked to me? We may have a woman Prime Minister, but nobody will take me seriously as the boss of a man like Andrews. For the experiments, we pretended he was still in charge. Anyway, it was funny to watch him go through the motions, knowing he was nothing [compared to —] This might be Thatcher’s England — but women are still treated like secretaries, no matter what job they do. People automatically turn to Andrews over me. So I decided to let them. Now, turn around. Get on your knees. Hands behind your head.\nTURLOUGH: (DOES SO) Look, if you’re going to kill me, I’d much rather you just got it over with.\nSALLY: If you say so. Switch left for a small charge, but right... (FX: CLICK OF SWITCH) .. if there’s no other choice. (BEAT) Goodbye, Turlough.\nSALLY: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 112"

I didn’t, actually. I thought that when we tried to use this to kill anything, it just wouldn’t work. I didn’t tell you earlier because I didn’t want to put a dampener on your morale. When you took the Sparkwire, I just had to hope I was right. But I see it’s backfired on you. There’s a bonus.\nRAT: (TELEPATHIC) The human has bested the woman.\nTURLOUGH: Ah, now I’m hearing voices, just like Nyssa! You two down there, I suppose? Well. you can stay right there, because this sparkwire still has some charge in it and unlike Sally here, I don’t want to kill you — I just want to get away from you.

Are they all right?\nRAT: (TELEPATHIC) Nyssa is assisting a Rat Scientist. Tegan is a prisoner. The Doctor is no threat.\nTURLOUGH: Which is rat-speak for ‘you have no idea where he is’. Alright then, rats, here’s the deal. You’re going to wait while I tie up Miss Lucas here and then we’re going to find my friends.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. SECRET CADOGAN TUNNELS. THE RADAR ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE SOUNDS OF MACHINERY BEING TAKEN APART, WIRES TORN OUT, ETC)\nCAITLIN: How does it look, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (TIGHTENING A SCREW) Well we’ve definitely got enough pieces from this radar array to make the device. The only problem is that it won’t scramble the rats like I said it would. The frequencies here are too different, even with a lot of jiggery pokery.\nCAITLIN: Why are you bothering then?\nDOCTOR: (HAMMERING A BOLT) Just because it doesn’t work the way we wanted doesn’t mean that it doesn’t work. When switched on, it’ll create a kind of sonic hum, a beckoning command that will affect the rats on a subsonic level.\nCAITLIN: In English?\nDOCTOR: (FLICKING A SWITCH A COUPLE OF TIMES) The Pied Piper blew his whistle and led the rats to a cliff where they jumped. He used the same techniques as I intend to. With this working, I should be able to gather the rats into one place.\nCAITLIN: And then?\nDOCTOR: (PLACING THE ITEM DOWN) Make them an offer they can’t refuse. Fly them somewhere in the TARDIS where they can live out their lives, free of humans perhaps. Once we’ve dug the TARDIS out.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. THE KING RAT’S LAIR\nTEGAN: (WALKING THROUGH WATER) Get off me, you idiot!\nANDREWS: I hope you’re not in any way useful to them, so I can shut you up for good.\nWALLACE: She’s right, Andrews. You are an idiot.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) What is intrusion?\nANDREWS: I found these two running around the tunnels. Who was stupid enough to let them escape?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You dare raise voice to us? We who made you human you are now?\nTEGAN: What does that mean?\nANDREWS: Nothing.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Hah! This human and his woman were nothing when they found us.\nANDREWS: Shut up. We were on a fast track up the civil service ladder before we met you.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Yes. Coffee boy and tea girl. Very high.\nANDREWS: I was in charge of this operation. Overseeing the handover of this site.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Your office don’t even know what’s here. You say you are important, but why send someone important here? You told us a version you liked, but we read the truth in your mind. You are here to tidy up, throw away old paper. You are a janitor.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 116\nANDREWS: Shut up! You might think you control me, but I control you. I let you do these things. When you take control, I’1l1 be president of Europe.\nTEGAN: You idiot! They don’t want to rule mankind — they want to wipe us out. They’ve been working on a plague to destroy the human race.\nANDREWS: No. Sally would have told me.\nTEGAN: Ask the three mouseketeers there.\nANDREWS: Is what she’s telling me true? Is that your plan? To kill us? And Sally knows this?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Sally more useful than you, Andrews. Understand our cause. Gave herself to us in mind, spirit... and body.\nANDREWS: What do you mean?\nWALLACE: They mean that she allowed herself to be experimented on. I saw it happen. They put one of those metal receivers in her head, injected her with various compounds... You’re yesterday’s news, Mr Andrews. Sally is as much rat as a human can be. She’s our future.\nANDREWS: No...\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Enough rambling. With the election, the time is right — the nation is distracted. We shall rise to surface and take it, then the world. Transmit order! Begin release of plague!\nANDREWS: What? Stay back! I warn you!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You cannot stop this with a bullet. Watch as your world is destroyed, then we let Sally herself end your pitiful life!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. RAT LABORATORY\nNYSSA: This vaccine still won’t hold together!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You have done everything you can, Nyssa — the vaccine is flawed. You find another way to create one.\nNYSSA: Do you think I don’t know that? But my blood... the Hellheim cure is in it, I can see it.. I just can’t unlock it!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You must work on this another time. Now you must help me with the virus before the Rat King demands the original. There is commotion outside.\nNYSSA: Just one more attempt?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) You do not understand — the Rat King has ordered the deaths of all humans! They are close to launching the virus! We must have a working alternative!\nNYSSA: You’re right, I’m sorry. You’ve been so helpful to me. Pass me the readouts on the control compound —\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) (ENTERING CUBICLE) Why is this human still alive?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) She is still useful.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) I have watched her. She has not advanced our research. She has worked on her own project. She has left her post and spoken to the human male in the treadwheel. She wishes to help him.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) That is none of your concern, Technician Fifteen.\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) You must kill her. Or allow us to kill her. The Rat King has ordered it.\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) The Rat King is wrong!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: VARIOUS RATS HEAR THIS AND SQUEAK / INTAKE BREATH IN SHOCK)\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) That is, um, the Rat King is too eager! We are so close to a compound that will control, not kill the humans! Make them willing drones! The humans won’t fight us! They’11l help us!\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Scientist Twenty Seven has been corrupted. Bring me the punishment vaccine.\nNYSSA: The what?\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Nyssa — run! You cannot overcome this many rats!\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) Stop the human.\nMUTOID: Muurghh!!!\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING) Get off me! I’m trying to help you!\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Please, look at what you’re doing! We have lived peacefully down here for years! Generations! The Rat King is mad! No! Keep that away from me! I’m loyal!\nNYSSA: That’s the punishment vaccine? But what does it —\nSCIENTIST RAT TWENTY SEVEN: (TELEPATHIC) Noo!!! Don’t — argggh! It hurtssss! Nonono keep thinking — skreeeeeee!!! Nuh — nuh — SKREEEEE!!!!\nNYSSA: No, please no... What’s happening?\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) The punishment is taking effect. His synapses are returning to normal. Soon he will be nothing more than a worker drone, controlled by his transmitter.\nNYSSA: But that’s horrible. To make him what he was and then — [take it away]\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 119\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) You opinion does not count. Take her to the Rat King!\nNYSSA: But what of Scientist Twenty Seven?\nTECHNICIAN RAT FIFTEEN: (TELEPATHIC) He is gone. Take her now!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: INT. RAT KING’S LAIR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MORE RATS ARE HERE NOW, LOW BUZZING AMONGST THE SPARKS AND THE WATER. NYSSA MARCHED INSIDE)\nTEGAN: Nyssa!\nNYSSA: (SPLASHES THROUGH WATER) Tegan! Oh, thank goodness you’re all right! They haven’t injected you with anything, have they?\nTEGAN: Not yet, but the day’s still young. Nyssa... They had a spy.\nWALLACE: Sally Lucas.\nNYSSA: Sally? But I left Turlough with her!\nTEGAN: Then let’s hope he figured it out.\nNYSSA: Yes. (TO WALLACE) Who are you, by the way?\nWALLACE: Christopher Wallace. I used to work here, now I’m more of a... guest.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, where’ve you been?\nNYSSA: In the medical labs. They felt I was useful. Well, until now. They said they were going to kill us?\nTEGAN: Probably. They’re releasing some plague. We’re probably the guinea pigs. Although they’11 need to pull Kev out of the treadwheel if they want to use him too — (WHISPER) Wait! Who’s that beside the cage?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: INT. RAT KING’S LAIR, TREADWHEEL\nKEVIN: (WALKING ON TREADWHEEL) Please... please let me stop...\nCAITLIN: (WHISPER) Kevin!\nKEVIN: (WALKING) Caitlin? What are you doing?\nCAITLIN: Setting you free! The rats are distracted. What happens if this stops?\nKEVIN: (WALKING) They electrocute me.\nCAITLIN: Then definitely keep walking.\nKEVIN: (WALKING) Where’s Matthew?\nCAITLIN: He’s dead, Kevin.\nKEVIN: (WALKING) He’s what? — Oh no, no, no...\nCAITLIN: I’m here with the Doctor, he has a plan. Wait until it all kicks off and I’1ll get you out of here.\nKEVIN: (WALKING) What’s that box?\nCAITLIN: The Doctor made it.\nCAITLIN: It’s like a homing beacon, a subsonic whistle of some kind. We’re going to turn it on in here, bring all the rats back.\nCAITLIN: Trust us! It’1ll work!\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. RAT KING’S LAIR\nTEGAN: (LOW) It’s Caitlin! Good on her, she escaped!\nWALLACE: Caitlin...?\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Bring humans to us!\nNYSSA: I think the King’s finished talking to Andrews.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) I have explained everything to Mister Andrews here. His loyalty has returned.\nTEGAN: Turncoat.\nANDREWS: Survivor.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You humans will be allowed to live, to watch as rats become dominant force! Your friend is dead! Rats have sent report and return with Miss Lucas! Your Doctor is missing, believed destroyed!\nDOCTOR: (EMERGING FROM THE SHADOWS) Just goes to show, a lot of fondly- held beliefs aren’t really based in fact.\nTEGAN: (SPLASHING AS SHE RUNS) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello Nyssa, hello Tegan. Now, keep away everyone, I’m sure your Security Rats have told you all what this whistle does.\nMUTOID: Wurrghhh...\nDOCTOR: And you too. Your synapses are tuned to these wavelengths too — this might not drive you mad, but it’1ll certainly hurt.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) What do you want, human?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR: Please, I’m as human as you are. And that’s why I’m here to speak to you. Now, Caitlin!\nCAITLIN: (ACROSS ROOM) Working, Doctor!\nCAITLIN: (FX: SWITCHES FLICKED, A FAINT HUMMING. RATS START SQUEAKING IN FEAR)\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) What — what is that noise? It grates our teeth!\nDOCTOR: That? Oh, I’m just calling every rat back to this room. I do hope it’s large enough!\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Why — why do this?\nDOCTOR: To show you that I can do this. I created a device in ten minutes with pieces of technology built half a century ago, that can control you. Imagine what I could do if I really put my mind to it? All I want is to make a suggestion.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) What — what is offer?\nDOCTOR: I have a craft that can travel through time and space. I can take you with me, I can take you all — we can find a world, a wonderful world, safe from humans where you can live your lives in peace. All I ask is that you stop this plan of attack.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) We don’t want peace, Doctor! We want revenge!\nNYSSA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Not now, Nyssa...\nNYSSA: The rats... they’re returning in numbers — but look! Something’s happening!\nNYSSA: (FX: THE BACKGROUND NOISE RISES AS THE RATS START TO GET\nRESTLESS: )\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: Yes. All those little transceivers in their heads, all so close to the source — it’s giving them feedback. Slowly step back...\nANDREWS: Stay where you are, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Ah, Mr Andrews. I wondered when you’d show your true colours. And hello, you must be Doctor Wallace. I’ve got your daughter with me —\nWALLACE: Caitlin?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but keep quiet, there’s a good chap. Time for reunions later.\nANDREWS: That’s it! I warned you! I’ve wanted to do this since I met you!\nANDREWS: (FX: THE SOUND OF A SPARKWIRE. ANDREWS SCREAMS, SPLASHES INTO WATER, UNCONSCIOUS )\nTURLOUGH: (APPROACHING) And I’ve wanted to do that since I met you.\nTEGAN: Turlough!\nTURLOUGH: Hello everyone. Are we in trouble again?\nTURLOUGH: (FX: THE BACKGROUND NOISE RISES AS THE RATS FILL THE ROOM, SCARED)\nNYSSA: You gave Andrews an electric shock while he was standing in water!\nTEGAN: Don’t you know how dangerous that is?\nTURLOUGH: Well, don’t all thank me at once.\nWALLACE: The rats are going mad — they’re tearing the place to pieces.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 125\nTEGAN: So, shall we get out of here while they run around in circles?\nDOCTOR: No, I need to give them one more chance. Tegan, Nyssa — help free Kevin from the treadwheel.\nTEGAN: Right.\nDOCTOR: (TO RAT KING) Two options, King Rat. You can come with me to my ship and I’1l take you away. Or I leave my device switched on and let you all destroy your own control centre in sheer blind confusion, then leave you to fend for yourselves without your technology.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) No! We will kill all humans! We must destroy you all!\nANDREWS: (SPLASHING TO HIS FEET) Whu-wait! But you suh-said I would —\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) We cannot trust any of you. You will all die!\nANDREWS: (FX: COCKS PISTOL AGAIN) Not if I kill you first!\nDOCTOR: No! Look out, Andrews!\nANDREWS: Aiieee!!!!\nNYSSA: (OFF) Doctor, we've got Kevin out!\nDOCTOR: Run, everyone!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE NOISE REACHES A CRECENDO — ALL THE RATS ARE NOW IN THE\nCONTROL ROOM. CROSSFADE TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.\nTEGAN: Are you really going to just leave them?\nDOCTOR: They’re intelligent creatures — I can’t just murder them.\nWALLACE: I think our fellow man might murder them when they find out they’re here.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s why I gave them the option to leave. I did my best, now —\nNYSSA: Doctor... it’s not enough.\nDOCTOR: What? Why not?\nNYSSA: They were about to release a plague. Even half mad with pain, they could still do it — it would only take one of them.\nWALLACE: She’s right. I’ve watched them perfect it for years. It’1ll kill everyone.\nTEGAN: So what do we do?\nNYSSA: I found something in their stores. The rat scientist I was working with wouldn’t tell me what it was, but he seemed afraid of it. I’d worked out the chemical structure so I made up some more in the lab, just so I’d have a back-up plan. (FX: UNZIPS POCKET) And here it is.\nTEGAN: A test tube?\nTURLOUGH: But if you don’t know what this stuff does —\nNYSSA: I do now. I saw them use it on the scientist — the rats call it P for ‘punishment’. It regresses them back into a normal rat. It’s cruel, but.. what if we gave it to the Rat King?\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR: The Hive mind would be destroyed. Their communication would be\nDOCTOR: gone. Even if they were still intelligent, the act of launching the plague would be beyond them. (SADLY) Give me the test tube, Nyssa —\nWALLACE: No, Nyssa. Give it to me.\nCAITLIN: But Dad!\nWALLACE: I created this mess, Cate. It’s up to me to fix it.\nDOCTOR: But the moment the Rat King is struck, it’1l de-evolve. The hive mind link will shatter, the rats will go even more berserk — it’s suicide.\nWALLACE: Not if I take your friend’s electrical device.\nTURLOUGH: The sparkwire?\nWALLACE: It’ll keep them away long enough to throw the punishment solution and then get back through the door. Once I’m through we simply lock it and leave. Trust me, nobody knows that room better than I do. I know how to get to the Rat King without the rats even seeing me!\nDOCTOR: All right. But at the first sign of trouble, we’re coming in after you.\nWALLACE: Agreed.\nCAITLIN: You can’t! What if they do kill you? I only just got you back!\nWALLACE: Cate, let me do this. Please.\nNYSSA: (PASSING TUBE) Here you go. Aim for the head. I saw a spray of this devolve a rat in seconds, but the King might be more resilient.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 128\nWALLACE: Wish me luck.\nTEGAN: What is he doing?\nCAITLIN: Why’s he still at the door?\nDOCTOR: He’s used the final sparkwire charge to fuse the lock! We can’t\nDOCTOR: get in!\nCAITLIN: (HAMMERING ON DOOR) Dad! What are you doing?!?\nWALLACE: (THROUGH DOOR) I’m sorry, Cate, but we have to end this. [..]\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. RAT KING’S LAIR\nWALLACE: [..] After I devolve the rats, I’m going to start an electrical fire, destroy this entire level. Shouldn’t be difficult. I suggest you get moving.\nCAITLIN: (MUFFLED, THROUGH DOOR) No! You’1l die!\nWALLACE: I died decades ago, Caitlin. I just haven’t lain down yet.\nWALLACE: Doctor, get her out of here. I don’t want her to see this.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. OTHER SIDE OF DOOR\nCAITLIN: (SOBS) No!\nDOCTOR: Page 130\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing we can do, Caitlin. He’s fused the doors. We\nDOCTOR: have to get out of here.\nTEGAN: Good luck, Wallace.\nWALLACE: Thank you, Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Come on — the TARDIS is this way.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. THE RAT KING’S LAIR\nWALLACE: Greetings, your majesty.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Wallace! We need you! We will make you our president! Stop this pain!\nANDREWS: Don’t... listen to him. It’s a bad deal.\nWALLACE: Sorry, Andrews, I’m afraid you’re trapped down here too.\nANDREWS: Probably for the best. I don’t know if I can live up there any more.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) Keep that .. solution away from us! Rats! Save us!\nMUTOID: Wurghh!\nWALLACE: I’m sorry — Singh, wasn’t it? You were a lab assistant? You didn’t deserve this. You didn’t deserve what they did to you.\nMUTOID: WurrGGHH!\nANDREWS: He’s backing off!\nWALLACE: They all are. All the humans that were turned. They know I can give them rest.\nKING RAT: (TELEPATHIC) You made us! Master!

OMINOUS RUMBLE)\nTEGAN: (RUNNING) What was that?\nNYSSA: (RUNNING) The tunnels collapsing, I expect.\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Too much structural damage. The entire place will probably fall in a matter of minutes. At which point Kevin's explosives will be triggered and seal the place for good.\nKEVIN: (RUNNING) So how do we get out?\nDOCTOR: (TO CAITLIN) My TARDIS. It can take us to the surface, then it’ll be up to Caitlin to decide what to do about all this. She has her story, after all.\nCAITLIN: There’s no story, Doctor. Just the truth. My father created monsters. If I go public with that, I damn him forever as far as the world’s concerned.\nKEVIN: What about me? I’ve got nothing. A washed-up squaddie who never got to see any action, who stumbles around tunnels looking for secrets nobody else believes. And the only other person who believed me — is dead.\nTURLOUGH: Can we have this discussion inside the TARDIS?\nNYSSA: (TARTLY) I think that’s a very good idea.\nTEGAN: Are you alright, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Yes. Yes. (BEAT; LOW) .. No.\nDOCTOR WHO: RAT TRAP by Tony Lee (FINAL) Page 133\nTEGAN: (LOW) We’ll talk later. (LOUDER) C’mon, Caitlin. —\nDOCTOR: When you reach the surface, Kevin, I’1ll help you contact some friends of mine in an organisation called UNIT. They’re good at cleaning up these sorts of things...\nCAITLIN: (FROM INSIDE THE TARDIS) What the — it’s huge!\nDOCTOR: (TO KEVIN) .. You never know, Kevin, they might well be on the lookout for open-minded people who believe the things that no- one else does.\nKEVIN: I will do, Doctor. And thank you.\nDOCTOR: In you go.\nCAITLIN: (FROM INSIDE THE TARDIS) Who’s this woman tied up on the floor?\nTEGAN: (FROM INSIDE THE TARDIS) Turlough... !\nTURLOUGH: (FROM INSIDE THE TARDIS) Oh, yes.
