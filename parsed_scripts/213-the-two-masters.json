The section of history I was about to pass through, the section thirty minutes from now, simply wasn’t there any more. The future, your future, wasn’t present. A huge chunk of reality.

Eventually. With a little investigation. If you let me go.\nJEMIMA: This is ridiculous. How can the future be missing? It doesn’t exist yet.\nDOCTOR: Oh, have an open mind! The past isn’t happening right now either, but it happened once, didn’t it? You still experienced it. Well, the future’s exactly the same, just the other way round.\nJEMIMA: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Release me and I might just be able to reverse what’s happened. Keep me here, and you die. I guarantee it.\nJEMIMA: Why should I believe you?\nDOCTOR: Why would anyone try that as a bluff if it wasn’t true? Please. I’ve done nothing to warrant your distrust. If there’s even the slightest chance I’m telling the truth, you’ve got to let me go, surely?\nJEMIMA: (CONSIDERING IT) How can I know if you’re telling the truth?\nDOCTOR: You can’t.\nDOCTOR: Too late.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 12\nBLORE: This him, is it?\nDOCTOR: Er...\nBLORE: Looks like we caught you just in time.

That’s what we usually steal...\nDOCTOR: Look. You don’t understand. I’m not a thief. (SIGHS) I’m the Doctor.\nBLORE: The Doctor?\nTAZMEENA: The Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. From the look of this ship, you’re late period Rocket Men, am I right? After the Asteroid. You should know who I am, and you should know what I do. I save people, I don’t steal from them. You must see I wouldn’t risk telling you that if I didn’t need you to believe me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 14\nBLORE: The Doctor, eh? (BEAT) Never heard of you.\nTAZMEENA: No, not a clue. What’s this asteroid you’re talking about?\nDOCTOR: The Asteroid. The home base of the Rocket Men. I destroyed it.

The one that just happened, how long ago was it?\nTAZMEENA: An hour or so — (STOPS SELF) Hey, you don’t get to ask questions!\nDOCTOR: And you can’t remember what you stole?\nTAZMEENA: T’ll get it eventually.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you will. You remember who you are, but actual history... no. It’s worse than I thought. It’s not just the future that’s missing. It’s the past too! We’re in a temporal island!\nBLORE: Whatever. I’ve had enough of your nonsense. Wait here. It’s been ages since I’ve done an execution. I’m going to come up with a really good one.\nDOCTOR: Please! I’m the only thing standing between you and oblivion.\nBLORE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nDOCTOR: (SADLY) No...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 15\nBLORE: That box of his might be worth something.\nTAZMEENA: You think?\nBLORE: Yeah, sure. Soon as we can figure out what it is...\nBLORE: (THEY WALK OFF DOWN THE CORRIDOR. THERE ARE FOOTSTEPS - JEMIMA’S BEHIND, AS SHE HEADS INTO THE CELLS)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: At least they left me this...\nDOCTOR: Although that’s hardly comforting.\nJEMIMA: Alright, you want out of here?\nDOCTOR: You! You believed me? About the time breaks?\nJEMIMA: No. Didn’t understand a word. But you got on board somehow. So you can get me out the same way.\nDOCTOR: You want that?\nJEMIMA: I don’t owe that lot anything. They killed my family. Stole me. Kept me like a pet.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. The memories must be deep-rooted if you’ve retained them despite the erasure.\nJEMIMA: And there you go again. Talking nonsense. Cut to the chase. Can I come with you?\nDOCTOR: What’s your name?\nJEMIMA: Jemima.\nDOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Jemima. You know, I could show you the universe. If you wanted me to. But it’s a dangerous place. If something is erasing parts of the time-stream I really couldn’t guarantee your safety.\nJEMIMA: You think I’m safe here? Please. Take me with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: I suppose you do fit the profile.\nJEMIMA: Then I’m getting you out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 18\nBLORE: Let’s do a data scan. If we can identify - What in - ?\nTAZMEENA: Where’s everybody gone?\nBLORE: What’s this? Somebody been making scale models of the crew?\nTAZMEENA: Feel a bit warm, don’t they?\nBLORE: Wait. Somebody’s sitting in my chair.\nDECAYED MASTER: (SPINNING THE CHAIR ROUND) And it sure ain’t Goldilocks.\nDECAYED MASTER: (NB: THE DECAYED MASTER IS FASTER AND MORE PLAYFUL THAN USUAL -\nBECAUSE: IT’S REALLY THE NEW MASTER IN THE WRONG BODY)\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, I know. Almost unbearably beautiful, aren’t I? The chiselled jaw. The fine cheekbones. The cold, crystal blue eyes acting as windows to the soul. Yes, some mornings I can hardly bear to look at myself in the mirror.\nBLORE: Who are you, monster? What you doing on my ship?\nDECAYED MASTER: Now that’s an interesting outfit, isn’t it? Where have I seen that before...?\nBLORE: Answer the question!\nDECAYED MASTER: (SNAPS FINGERS) Oh, yes. Of course. You’re the Rocket Men! I remember. A pathetic rag-tag bunch of no-hopers with delusions of power on a cosmic scale. So this is what became of you after the Doctor destroyed your base...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 19\nBLORE: The Doctor? Did you just say... the Doctor?\nTAZMEENA: That chap in the cells?\nBLORE: He did what?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, don’t worry. If you can’t remember, it’s not important right now. All I needed from you was his location, and you’ve just told me that. So, look, it’s been lovely catching up, we must do it again sometime, but I really can’t stop and chat. I’m an awfully busy fellow and I’ve got a schedule to keep. So if you don’t mind.\nBLORE: Aaaarghhhhh!\nBLORE: (BLORE’S BONES BREAK AND CRUNCH. HIS SCREAM DWINDLES AS HE’S SHRUNK DOWN TO THE SIZE OF A DOLL AND DROPS TO THE FLOOR)\nTAZMEENA: Wha- what just happened? Where’d he go?\nDECAYED MASTER: He didn’t go anywhere. Just lost a few inches.\nTAZMEENA: You’re the one who did all the models...\nDECAYED MASTER: Not exactly...\nTAZMEENA: No. You.. you killed him! You killed him!\nDECAYED MASTER: Did I? Oh, how awful. That’s a bit of an oversight by the manufacturers, isn’t it? Does this thing not have any safety settings?\nDECAYED MASTER: (HE TAPS THE ELIMINATOR. TAZMEENA LEAPS FOR THE CONTROLS. HITS THE TANNOY. AN ALARM BLARES AND HER VOICE ECHOES )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL)\nTAZMEENA: All crew, alert. We have a hostile on board, he’s killed the captain, he - Aaaaargh!\nDECAYED MASTER: Page 20\nDECAYED MASTER: No, clearly not. There it goes again. Hope I kept the receipt...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s alarming.\nJEMIMA: A hostile on board? Everyone will think it’s you!\nDOCTOR: Really? She was clearly talking about whoever it was that made her scream.\nJEMIMA: And you reckon anyone’s going to work out that wasn’t us?\nDOCTOR: I suppose not. How many crewmen does this ship have?\nJEMIMA: About thirty?\nDOCTOR: Then we’d better hurry. It’d be wise to get away from here.\nDOCTOR: (THEY START RUNNING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. A ROCKET MAN APPEARS AT THE\nOTHER: END)\nROCKET MAN: There!\nJEMIMA: Other way!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 22\nDECAYED MASTER: Escaped? Already? Oh, for goodness’ sake, Doctor, what’s the point of a chap trying to pull of a dramatic rescue if you’re just going to break out before I can get to you? The ingratitude!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: Where now?\nJEMIMA: This way...\nJEMIMA: (THEY DART DOWN A CORRIDOR. BRIEF PAUSE. THEN A FLURRY OF GUNFIRE\nFROM: DOWN THAT CORRIDOR. THE DOCTOR AND JEMIMA RACE BACK OUT)\nJEMIMA: Maybe not that way then.\nDOCTOR: Do we have another route through?\nJEMIMA: I’m thinking. We’re running out of options.\nDOCTOR: Quickly.\nROCKET MAN: Stop!\nDOCTOR: Not quickly enough.\nROCKET MAN: Raise your hands.\nDOCTOR: I seem to be doing that a lot today.\nROCKET MAN: Do it!\nDOCTOR: (RAISING HIS HANDS) Best do as he says.\nJEMIMA: I did it before he asked.\nROCKET MAN: You killed the Captain. I sentence you to summary execution.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: Now look here -\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nJEMIMA: What happened to him? Where’d he go?\nDOCTOR: We need to leave.\nJEMIMA: But why? He’s vanished.\nDOCTOR: Well, you know how I told you how the situation was really rather dire?\nJEMIMA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: It’s just got immeasurably worse.\nDECAYED MASTER: Come on, that’s no way to greet an old friend, is it? One doesn’t expect cake and bunting, but is a hug really out of the question?\nJEMIMA: (SHOCKED) Who is that?\nDOCTOR: Your worst nightmare.\nDECAYED MASTER: Made flesh. Which one is this? Have we met? I lose track.\nDOCTOR: She’s... new. Early days.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 25\nDECAYED MASTER: Really. Well, hello then, young lady. I’m called the Master. Don’t listen to a word he says about me. He’ll make all these terrible claims, saying I’ve done this, caused that, murdered these people, eradicated this species, but don’t believe any of it. In reality, I’m far, far worse.\nDOCTOR: Enough of your games. What do you want?\nDECAYED MASTER: Want? What do you mean, ‘want’? Isn’t it obvious? I’m here to rescue you, old boy.\nDOCTOR: Rescue me?\nDECAYED MASTER: You can thank me later. First, we get back to your -\nROCKET: MAN 2: There you are! (HE STARTS CHARGING FOR THEM) Stop in the name of - (TCE FIRES) Aaaargh!\nDECAYED MASTER: Honestly. We’re in the middle of a conversation! The rudeness of some people... Now, this way, I think...\nDOCTOR: I told you - I’m not playing.\nDECAYED MASTER: What?\nJEMIMA: Look, not being funny, but shouldn’t we go with him? What with the vicious pirates and gaps in time and everything. We need all the help we can get.\nDECAYED MASTER: Doctor, your monkey has a point.\nJEMIMA: Hey!\nDOCTOR: I don’t trust you.\nDECAYED MASTER: I’m sure you don’t, but do you really have time to indulge that distrust? Do any of us?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: Alright...\nDECAYED MASTER: Excellent! That’s the spirit! Now, I believe your TARDIS is in the hold -\nJEMIMA: Yes, it’s this way. Follow me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE TISSUE COMPRESSION ELIMINATOR FIRES AGAIN AS THE GROUP CHARGE\nDOWN: MORE CORRIDORS )\nDOCTOR: Will you stop killing them?\nDECAYED MASTER: But I’m so good at it. You save people, I murder them. It’s what we do!\nJEMIMA: They’1l kill us if he doesn’t stop them, it’s our only way out of here!\nDOCTOR: Don’t make me regret allowing you to accompany me, Jemima.\nDECAYED MASTER: In ten minutes the gap in reality will erase everyone on this ship from time. They’re dead whatever happens, at least this way I get to have fun.\nDECAYED MASTER: 5 x ROCKET MEN:\nDECAYED MASTER: Can’t be more than about ten of them left, we should have a clear run now.\nDOCTOR: I can’t believe we were once friends.\nDECAYED MASTER: Trust me, no matter how much anger you might feel for me at the moment, it’s as nothing to the fury I currently have bubbling within.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nJEMIMA: It’s right here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: (THEY ENTER, THE DOCTOR AND JEMIMA COME TO A STOP, THE DECAYED\nMASTER: MOVING AHEAD. THEY’RE BY HIS TARDIS, WHICH IS SPARKING AND\nSPUTTERING: )\nDOCTOR: What on —- ?\nJEMIMA: What’s that? Looks like a.. Grandfather clock, sort of.\nDECAYED MASTER: It’s not important.\nJEMIMA: That wasn’t here earlier...\nDOCTOR: it's his. TARDIS:.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, yes, come along people, come along, clock’s ticking.\nJEMIMA: Well, that clock ain’t. That’s his version of your box?\nDOCTOR: I think it was once, yes.\nJEMIMA: So why’s it all... sparky and melty?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea, they’re not supposed to look like that. (TO MASTER) What have you done to it?\nDECAYED MASTER: It’s a long story, and might I remind you we don’t have time for those? Alacrity is the order of the day. Come along, hurry, hurry, hurry.\nDECAYED MASTER: Your ship’s at the other end, yes?\nDOCTOR: Correct, just over - Ah.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 29\nROCKET: MAN 3: I thought we’d find you here.\nDOCTOR: That’s where the others got to.\nROCKET: MAN 3: Ten against three. Fancy your odds?\nDECAYED MASTER: Very much so! (ASIDE TO THE DOCTOR AND JEMIMA) Keep close to me.\nDOCTOR: What? What are you planning?\nDECAYED MASTER: Just do it! If you’d like to live. Grab your pet too, if you fancy keeping her...\nDOCTOR: Best do as he says...\nJEMIMA: Alright.\nJEMIMA: (THE DECAYED MASTER PULLS OUT A HANDHELD DEVICE. HE PRESSES A BUTTON AND THERE’S A QUIET BUZZ OF ENERGY)\nROCKET: MAN 3: Two killers and a traitor, eh?\nJEMIMA: This isn’t what it looks like.\nROCKET: MAN 3: Isn’t it?

DEBRIS\nWHIPS: AROUND THEM AS THE SHIP STARTS TEARING APART. )\nJEMIMA: (SHOUTING) What was that?!\nDECAYED MASTER: (SHOUTING) I planted a bomb here when I arrived. A little contingency plan. I try to anticipate every eventuality.\nDOCTOR: (SPOTTING HIS SHIP) My TARDIS! —- Did you anticipate blowing my\nTARDIS: out into space too?\nDECAYED MASTER: Naturally! Have a little faith!\nJEMIMA: How come we’re still... hanging here?\nDOCTOR: Something to do with the force field from your TARDIS, I’m guessing.\nDECAYED MASTER: Well, it wasn’t doing much good in that broken down pile of wreckage, was it? I thought I’d employ it for a slightly more useful purpose. Vis-a-vis, continued existence. I made the basic elements portable, see? This device here.\nDOCTOR: That won’t last long.\nDECAYED MASTER: With the dead time approaching we don’t have long.\nJEMIMA: Presumably that’s why you didn’t use it when we were getting shot.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, why waste the battery? The protective bubble’s relatively tight around us, giving us something to stand on, some air to breathe... but with a little adjustment...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL)\nDECAYED MASTER: [CONT'D] I can loop it around your TARDIS. Now it’s just a question of nipping over to it, and hopping on in.\nDOCTOR: It’s drifted a bit.\nJEMIMA: How long until we hit this gap in time?\nDOCTOR: Can’t be more than five minutes now.\nDECAYED MASTER: Then I suggest we run.\nDOCTOR: I agree.\nDOCTOR: Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOORS OPEN AND THE DOCTOR, JEMIMA AND THE DECAYED MASTER\nSTUMBLE: IN. THE CLOISTER BELL IS STILL TOLLING, ALARMS ARE STILL RINGING)\nDECAYED MASTER: That was too close, it was almost out of power.\nDOCTOR: That panel there, we don’t have much time...\nDECAYED MASTER: I’m there.\nJEMIMA: Blimey, your box, it’s -\nDOCTOR: Yes, deceptively spacious. That’s what the Estate Agent said. How long have we got?\nDECAYED MASTER: Sixty seconds, perhaps?\nJEMIMA: And then?\nDECAYED MASTER: Nothing. No-time. We need to project over the gap.\nDOCTOR: You’ve done it before?\nDECAYED MASTER: A few times. My TARDIS reacted rather badly.\nDOCTOR: It’s happening a lot?\nDECAYED MASTER: Throughout all recorded history. Blank patches of time, spreading everywhere.\nDOCTOR: Why? What’s causing it?\nDECAYED MASTER: A question for later, I think... Reckon you can manage this?\nDOCTOR: I can try.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 33\nDECAYED MASTER: Then what are we waiting for. Let’s give it all we’ve got!\nDECAYED MASTER: (THEY SLAM THE CONTROLS HOME, THEN RAPIDLY HIT MORE BUTTONS.

We make a good team, you and I.\nDOCTOR: We are not a team. We are never a team.\nDECAYED MASTER: Please yourself.\nJEMIMA: He just saved us, how can you be angry with him!\nDOCTOR: Because I’ve met him. His soul’s as decayed as his current appearance.\nDECAYED MASTER: Flattery will get you nowhere.\nDOCTOR: This is your fault, isn’t it? The gaps in time?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, my dear fellow, not at all, not at all! I’m just an innocent party, like you.\nDOCTOR: You expect me to believe that?\nDECAYED MASTER: Not really, but it’s the truth, so it’s what I’m going to tell you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 35\nJEMIMA: He’s not lying, is he?\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t believe he is. If it’s not you, what’s causing it? And why did you come for me?\nDECAYED MASTER: In answer to the first question, no idea. In answer to the second... well, you saw the state my TARDIS was in, I wasn’t going to get past another one of those gaps unscathed.\nDOCTOR: No, there’s more to it than that. You could have just stolen my TARDIS and left me there. But you didn’t. You took me with you. Why?\nDECAYED MASTER: Because I need your help.\nDOCTOR: Help? You expect me to help you? After all you’ve done in the past? After all you did just now?\nDECAYED MASTER: What, saving your life?\nDOCTOR: After endangering it in the first place, and by murdering thirty people!\nDECAYED MASTER: Was it as many as that? I’ve stopped counting. It’s tricky to keep track once you hit tens of thousands.\nDOCTOR: I will never help you.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, I thought that might be the case.\nJEMIMA: What you doing?\nDECAYED MASTER: This, my dear, is a tissue compression eliminator. It eliminates you through tissue compression. Or eliminates tissue compression, I’ve never been entirely sure, the name’s a trifle confusing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 36\nJEMIMA: (WORRIED) So why you pointing it at me?\nDECAYED MASTER: Doctor, must we do this again? Why do you think I let you keep her?\nDOCTOR: Very well. What do you want?\nDECAYED MASTER: That’s the spirit. Just a journey, just a quick journey. And your assistance in battle.\nDOCTOR: Battle?\nDECAYED MASTER: We’re going up against the deadliest foe I’ve ever encountered.\nDOCTOR: Deadlier than me?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, my dear Doctor, your arrogance is never ending. You flatter yourself that you are in some way my nemesis, Moriarty to my Holmes, but in reality you provide merely adequate opposition, worthy of very little attention.\nDOCTOR: If you insist.\nDECAYED MASTER: No, the prey we seek is a far grander, far more intimidating proposition. An adversary like no other.\nDOCTOR: Really? Who?\nDECAYED MASTER: Me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 37"

I sent them out to check my old boltholes for any sign of him.. One of them located him on that prison island UNIT kept me in once.\nDOCTOR: Your old prison? What was he doing back there?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, the usual sort of thing. Something to do with a Carmentine mind leach. But you were there, Doctor. Don’t you remember?\nDOCTOR: I was?\nDECAYED MASTER: My agent said he’d met you. He was disguised as a boatman. Rather cunningly, I had him use your involvement as cover. While you kept my other self busy, he was able to plant a tracker on my TARDIS. His TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t ring a bell, I’m afraid.\nDECAYED MASTER: Doubtless an after-effect of your encounter with the leach. Forget I mentioned it.\nDECAYED MASTER: Aha. Here we are. Now according to the historical records I’ve found here, in a slight alteration to the old timeline... that fleet’s being led by a humanoid ally of Kalazar. Known as General Malgrove. Does his picture remind you of anyone?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR: Malgrove. Of course. The Gorlan word for Master. Sometimes I wonder if you have any imagination at all. One of your later iterations I see.\nDECAYED MASTER: He’1l be playing both sides. Helping one Baron destroy the other, whilst maintaining the illusion of being a friend to both. Then when they’re out of the way, he steps in to fill the resultant power vacuum. It’s quite brilliant.\nJEMIMA: How come you’re so sure? How do you know that’s his plan?\nDECAYED MASTER: Because it’s what I’d do.\nJEMIMA: I’m not even going to pretend I understand this.\nDOCTOR: And yet despite your... ‘shared history’ you’re viewing him as an adversary.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes! Curious, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: So you want us to land on that ship? Why? What are you planning?\nDECAYED MASTER: No, I’ve got to keep some things to myself, now haven’t I?

What’s this hostile wotsit?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: The HADS. In the event of an attack, it immediately translates the TARDIS to the nearest safe environment.\nDECAYED MASTER: It doesn’t work temporally, it’s on a different circuit, so it should still be operational.\nJEMIMA: So why aren’t you using that?\nDECAYED MASTER: Because he’s bloody-minded, that’s why. We’re being fired on by a fleet of spaceships. By definition, the nearest safe environment is inside one of those ships. Specifically, the most secure and well-armoured one.\nJEMIMA: The flagship.\nDOCTOR: Precisely where he wants to go.\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, that one practically popped in to use the bathroom!\nDOCTOR: You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?\nDECAYED MASTER: Can I not have some fun once in a while?\nDOCTOR: Not usually this much.

I won’t let him harm you.\nJEMIMA: I’m glad to hear it.\nDOCTOR: What do you want me to do?\nDECAYED MASTER: That’s the spirit! I want you to take him this.\nJEMIMA: What? You’re giving him cigars?\nDECAYED MASTER: No, this is far more than a cigar box, though I accept the appearance is similar.\nDOCTOR: What’s in it?\nDECAYED MASTER: Let’s not spoil the surprise. Take it to him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR: I’m a Doctor, not a postman. Why can’t you give it to him yourself?\nDECAYED MASTER: Because he and I are not on the best of terms presently. I ama man quite literally at war with myself.\nDOCTOR: You’re fighting each other? Master versus Master?\nDECAYED MASTER: I suppose you could put it that way.\nDOCTOR: You’re saying he actually wants to kill you? But that’s ridiculous! He can’t kill you without destroying himself!\nDECAYED MASTER: And yet it appears to be what’s happening.\nDOCTOR: I can’t believe that.\nDECAYED MASTER: You saw his hired assassins try to murder me in Upper Hexford, how can you doubt it?\nDOCTOR: (BAFFLED) Upper Hexford?\nDECAYED MASTER: Dear me, Doctor. Short-term memory is the first to go, they say. You and I had an encounter there, quite recently.\nDOCTOR: We did?\nDECAYED MASTER: Well, recently for me, for you it was a while back. I got myself rejuvenated and started looking for him, the other me.\nDOCTOR: I don’t remember that.\nDECAYED MASTER: You must. It would stick in the mind. My TARDIS up for auction? The Trans-Human Sisters on my tail? Those wretched, ungrateful children of mine?\nDOCTOR: Children, what are you talking about?\nJEMIMA: Eh?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 55\nDECAYED MASTER: You must remember. It was you. Well, an older, younger you. The drippy blonde one. Wanders around dressed like nobody who’s ever played cricket ever. It was that you.\nDOCTOR: And you were as you are now?\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes!\nDOCTOR: I don’t recall meeting this version of you in that incarnation.\nDECAYED MASTER: (SOMEWHAT TROUBLED) Don’t you?\nDOCTOR: It was always the one with the goatee beard and the taste for melodrama. When was this? Who was I travelling with?\nDECAYED MASTER: You were alone.\nDOCTOR: That could be a few occasions, I - (PAUSE) You know, there is an absence once, when I was him. Now you come to mention it. Somewhere around Little Hodcombe... How odd. A period of... nothingness.\nJEMIMA: Like the gaps in time.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, exactly like that. Now I wonder why that’s happened?\nDECAYED MASTER: I’m sure it won’t be anything to worry about. Well then. Are you going or not?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 56\nNEW MASTER: Yes?\nBAUZA: We’ve detected an unusual temporal signature in the missile bay, sir. It only registered after that craft’s apparent destruction.\nNEW MASTER: (QUIETLY) I’ve got you. (ALOUD) Send a squad down. I want anyone or anything that emerges from that box brought to me. Immediately.\nBAUZA: Sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 57\nDECAYED MASTER: Off you pop then, Doctor. Give him the box, then get him to open a\nDOCTOR: He won’t want to do that.\nDECAYED MASTER: Make him.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure I want him to. Is it a bomb?\nDECAYED MASTER: Nothing so crude. You’ll enjoy it, trust me. Now you understand? It’s vital he doesn’t know I’m here.\nDOCTOR: I understand.\nDECAYED MASTER: I’ll be watching you. Say anything more and she dies.\nDOCTOR: I said I understood!\nDECAYED MASTER: Then what are you waiting for? We’ve less than thirty minutes til the next time break! Allez-oop!\nDOCTOR: T’ll come back for you, Jemima.\nJEMIMA: I know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR EMERGES. DOZENS OF TROOPS ARE WAITING. THEY RACK THEIR\nWEAPONS: )\nGORLAN: Stop right there. Hands in the air.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nGORLAN: Hands in the air!\nDOCTOR: Quite the day for that, isn’t it? (HE RAISES THEM IN THE AIR)\nGORLAN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t understand. Take me to your Master.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 59\nGORLAN: (DISTORT) You three, wait here. Guard the blue box. You, prisoner. This way!\nGORLAN: (THE GORLAN GRINDS OUT OF THE ROOM WITH THE DOCTOR. THE DECAYED\nMASTER: SWITCHES OFF THE MONITOR)\nDECAYED MASTER: Excellent!\nJEMIMA: Did you know he’d be captured that quickly?\nDECAYED MASTER: I knew it was a possibility, yes. In fact, I was rather hoping he would.\nJEMIMA: Oh? Why?\nDECAYED MASTER: You’re full of questions, aren’t you? Questions, questions, questions, have you considered making a statement once in a while?\nJEMIMA: Oh, I’ll make a statement, all right. I’ll make a statement. On your face.\nDECAYED MASTER: Hmm, I’m pretty certain that’s nonsensical bravado, but at least you’re trying. No, the Doctor’s immediate capture means I’ll be able to commence my side of the plan sooner rather than later.\nJEMIMA: You’re going out there? Of course. You’re up to something.\nDECAYED MASTER: What gave it away? Well, young lady, I’m afraid that this is where we part company.\nJEMIMA: You’re not taking me with you? Why not?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 60\nDECAYED MASTER: Because you’re a tediously imbecilic example of a lesser species, and I’d rather not mooch around babysitting you when I could be doing something more interesting with my time, like staring vacantly at a wall.\nJEMIMA: You’re not a very nice man, are you?\nDECAYED MASTER: I’m glad you’ve noticed.\nDECAYED MASTER: I’m terribly sorry, my dear, but you’ve outlived your usefulness.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 61\nGORLAN: 2: Stop! Raise your hands in the air!\nDECAYED MASTER: What? Dear boys, don’t you recognise me? I know carbon based life can be a little tricky for you chaps to distinguish between, but I can’t have changed that much, can I?\nGORLAN: 2: Should we know you?\nDECAYED MASTER: Of course. I’m your General. General Malgrove!\nGORLAN: 2: You do not look like the general.\nDECAYED MASTER: Scan me if you don’t believe me.\nGORLAN: I will!\nDECAYED MASTER: It was that fellow who left the box before me. He captured me. Tortured me. Left me for dead. Fortunately, I survived.\nDECAYED MASTER: Well?\nGORLAN: 2: You are the General!\nDECAYED MASTER: See? I don’t want to say ‘I told you so’, but -\nGORLAN: 2: My apologies, sir. To point my weapon at you. It was a... monstrous error.\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, not at all, not at all, it’s quite forgotten. Don’t trouble yourself. Now, if we could get on. I’m feeling a trifle discombobulated following my ordeal. I could do with a little lie down. Might you, perhaps, show me to my room?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 62\nGORLAN: Prisoner as requested, General.\nNEW MASTER: Excellent. Thank you.\nGORLAN: I put the blue box under guard.\nNEW MASTER: Good. Good. Doctor. What a pleasure to see you again.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry I can’t say the same to you.\nNEW MASTER: And with a new face too. How delightful. You’re getting through them almost as quickly as me these days.\nDOCTOR: (BEMUSED) A new... face?\nNEW MASTER: What are you doing here, Doctor? Invading my stronghold alone is foolhardy even for you. You must have some ulterior purpose. I’d be gratified to learn of it before your annihilation. Just to ease my curiosity if nothing else...\nDOCTOR: You know, I’m not entirely sure... You’ve not met my current persona before?\nNEW MASTER: No. Last time was the carnival clown, don’t you remember?\nDOCTOR: No. I don’t. And you looked like that?\nNEW MASTER: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Was it in your old prison, by any chance? Something to do with a Cermentine mind leach?\nNEW MASTER: You know it was.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I definitely don’t remember that. Interesting.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL)\nNEW MASTER: An after-effect of your encounter with the leach.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. Or perhaps it’s another gap...\nNEW MASTER: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: No, but I’m beginning to.\nNEW MASTER: Well, I’m sure discussing our relative appearances must be\nNEW MASTER: Page 63\nNEW MASTER: fascinating for someone, but it isn’t me. You will explain your purpose here before I count to three, or I will have you shot. One\nDOCTOR: Oh, let’s not go that far. I’m here to bring you this.\nNEW MASTER: A box? What’s in it?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea. I didn’t pack it myself.\nNEW MASTER: Then who did?\nDOCTOR: I’m not at liberty to say. But I was told to bring it to you and to\nDOCTOR: make you open it.\nNEW MASTER: (TO GORLAN) You. Gorlan. Scan it.\nGORLAN: Sir.\nGORLAN: (THE GORLAN RUNS A PORTABLE SCANNING DEVICE OVER THE BOX.\nBEEPS: ) Nothing registers as harmful, General.\nNEW MASTER: Not a bomb? It doesn’t contain or virus, or something?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 64\nGORLAN: No, sir.\nNEW MASTER: I see. (PAUSE) What’s in it, Doctor? I know you of old. You’re not to be trusted. There’s some trick to this, I know there is.\nDOCTOR: Like I say, I can’t help you. I simply don’t have the answers. Think of it as Schrodinger’s parcel, the contents will only exist when you prise it apart.\nNEW MASTER: If you want me to open it, I suspect I probably shouldn’t.\nDOCTOR: I don’t particularly want you to. I’m only trying to persuade you because a friend of mine dies if I don’t. (PAUSE) Tense, isn’t it?\nNEW MASTER: Alright, you open the box. —- Gorlan, throw a protective shield around the prisoner. If anything comes out of that box, it’s not getting to me.\nDOCTOR: You’re too kind.\nNEW MASTER: Well do it.\nDOCTOR: I suppose I have little choice in the matter.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nNEW MASTER: What’s in it?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely nothing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page\nDECAYED MASTER: Ah, yes, good. The main navigation controls. So many of then... Thank you, you’ve been a lot of help.\nGORLAN: 2: I thought you’d have known where they were, General.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, and that’s your problem. You didn’t think. Goodbye.\nGORLAN: 2: (CRUMBLING) Aaaargh!\nDECAYED MASTER: Now. Where to start, where to start...\nDECAYED MASTER: 65\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 66\nNEW MASTER: Gorlan! Lower the shield!\nNEW MASTER: There’s got to be something inside that box.\nNEW MASTER: Nothing. Literally nothing.\nNEW MASTER: What are you up to, Doctor?!\nDOCTOR: I’m not up to anything! I’m as surprised as you are.\nNEW MASTER: Nice try. But I don’t believe you. Very well, if you won’t supply answers willingly, I may have to employ... special instruments of persuasion.\nDOCTOR: It really won’t help.\nNEW MASTER: What’s happening?\nBAUZA: Sir, we’ve changed course.\nNEW MASTER: Oh?\nBAUZA: We’re now heading directly for the Hypertunnel relays.\nNEW MASTER: Then change back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 67\nBAUZA: I’m trying to, sir. But the navigation systems aren’t responding. We can’t have more than twenty minutes.\nNEW MASTER: If we crash into that relay, the ship will be destroyed! The tunnel too!\nBAUZA: I know, sir. I’m trying my best...\nNEW MASTER: This is your doing, Doctor. Somehow or other this is all down to\nNEW MASTER: you.\nDOCTOR: I can assure you it’s not.\nNEW MASTER: (PAINED, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE GORLANS) What in -\nDOCTOR: (PAINED, BUT NOT AS MUCH) No, he can’t be -\nBAUZA: (AGONISED) Sir! Sir, please, help me, I can’t stand the - Aaarghhhh!\nBAUZA: (SHE SHATTERS INTO A CLOUD OF DUST. ALL THE GORLANS AROUND THE\nBRIDGE: FOLLOW SUIT)\nDOCTOR: The Gorlans. They’re exploding! Get down!\nDOCTOR: (THE NEW MASTER AND THE DOCTOR DUCK. THE TONE CUTS OUT. THE DUST SETTLES. THEY RISE)\nNEW MASTER: No! Dead! They’re all dead!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: A sonic tone. Keyed to explode rock... leaving us the sole survivors...\nNEW MASTER: (GRABBING HIM BY THE SCRUFF) What have you done? Everything was going so well. Then you! What was in this box?\nDOCTOR: Nothing! It looks empty!\nNEW MASTER: (SHOVING IT INTO HIS HANDS) Show me what it does!\nDOCTOR: (FIDDLING WITH IT) I don’t know what it is!\nDECAYED MASTER: Then I’1l tell you. A microscopic sonic generator. Keyed to Gorlan biology, via this vessel’s public address system.\nNEW MASTER: No! Not... you!\nDECAYED MASTER: You’ve lost your army, Master. That must be shattering.\nNEW MASTER: No! (PRODUCING WEAPON) No, I’m not going back in there!\nDOCTOR: See sense, Master! You can’t shoot your earlier self!\nNEW MASTER: Can’t I?\nNEW MASTER: (THE NEW MASTER FIRES HIS TCE AT THE DECAYED MASTER WHO DUCKS\nAWAY: )\nDECAYED MASTER: Missed!\nDECAYED MASTER: (CALLING OUT AFTER HIM) Run all you like! You’re not getting away!\nDOCTOR: He tried to shoot you! He really doesn’t care if you die!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 69\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, I told you that. Didn’t you believe me? Come along. Back to your ship.\nDOCTOR: But he’s escaping.\nDECAYED MASTER: No he isn’t. He’ll be heading for his quarters. That’s where he left his TARDIS. As least... that’s what he thinks.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 70\nNEW MASTER: No! Where is it? What have you done with my TARDIS?!\nNEW MASTER: Yes?\nBARON: (COMMUNICATOR DISTORT) General, your ship appears to be heading directly for the Hypertunnel -\nNEW MASTER: Yes, yes, I’d noticed.\nBARON: (DISTORT) Might I remind you in the strongest terms -\nNEW MASTER: Quiet, fool. I do not have time for your inanities!\nNEW MASTER: I said I do not have time!\nDECAYED MASTER: (DISTORT) Now, now, no need to be rude, is there? We go back a\nDECAYED MASTER: long way.\nNEW MASTER: You! Tell me! Where is my TARDIS?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DECAYED MASTER SPEAKS INTO A COMMUNICATOR, THE DOCTOR TO ONE SIDE)\nDECAYED MASTER: (CHUCKLES) Now, now, that would be telling.\nNEW MASTER: (DISTORT) I will destroy you for this!\nDECAYED MASTER: Then you’ll never get off this crate, will you? Can’t have long now before it crashes, can we? I imagine it’ll be a pretty big boom.\nNEW MASTER: (DISTORT) What do you want?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, a chat, just a chat. Three minutes. The missile bay. Be there.\nDOCTOR: Was that wise?\nDECAYED MASTER: Doctor. I think it’s time to clear the air.\nDOCTOR: What’s that you’re holding?\nDOCTOR: Urgh!\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh. Not air freshener. Knock out gas. I really should label these\nDECAYED MASTER: things more carefully.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 72\nALERT: Proximity alert. Collision imminent. Please abandon ship.\nALERT: (THIS REPEATS REGULARLY AFTER A SHORT PERIOD. THE DECAYED MASTER IS TYING THE DOCTOR TO A CHAIR, TIGHTENING KNOTS)\nDECAYED MASTER: Morning! Did you sleep well? Now, now. Don’t struggle.\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) Oh great. Tied to a chair again... Always ready to double cross me, aren’t you?\nDECAYED MASTER: You’d feel betrayed if I didn’t.\nNEW MASTER: (DISTANT) You know, I could shoot you in the back right now, Master. Then I’d be free. I could steal the Doctor’s TARDIS and escape.\nDECAYED MASTER: The key to the Doctor’s TARDIS is hidden as well as your own ship. You’re not escaping this craft’s imminent immolation unless I say so, and you know what I want!\nNEW MASTER: (DISTANT) I’d rather die! I’11 kill you before I go back there!\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, I don’t think you’1ll have to. Come on. Join us. You might see things more clearly.\nNEW MASTER: (TAKING IN THE SCENE) But... I don’t understand. You’ve tied him up, you’re not working with him?\nDECAYED MASTER: We were, sort of. But you know how it is with the Doctor, collaboration never ends well.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 73\nNEW MASTER: Who are you? Who resides in that cadaverous form?\nDECAYED MASTER: (THROWN) You... don’t know?\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST FULLY RECOVERED) He might not, but I do.\nNEW MASTER: Oh?\nDOCTOR: I should have realised sooner. The Master with the decayed face is usually quite a serious sort. Cold, cruel. But this time round he’s been enjoying himself a little too much. He’s been playful, insane. More the sort of personality I’d associate with you. And you seem somewhat subdued. Almost as if you’d switched bodies.\nNEW MASTER: What?\nDOCTOR: He’s you. I mean, there’s more to it than that, obviously. He’s the future you. Not on the outside, of course. That’s your past. I’m talking about the creature within.\nNEW MASTER: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Neither do I, not really. But it’s the only thing that makes sense. Although I use the word ‘sense’ loosely.\nNEW MASTER: (STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH IT) I - (GATHERS HIMSELF) So - what happened? I know I took this shell off... someone, but I... struggle to recall the details. You’re saying it’s the body of my future self...? I stole the body from my future self?\nDOCTOR: Well, I don’t know precisely what happened, but presumably, yes.\nNEW MASTER: I don’t understand. How can this be?\nDECAYED MASTER: It doesn’t matter in the slightest. I am not pleased to be contained within this walking corpse again. Whether you knew my identity or not, that is still my body you’re squatting in. And I would like it back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 74\nNEW MASTER: Don’t make me return to that... thing...\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, I won’t. I remember those days. The pain is almost unendurable. I feel it now. I would never condemn myself to this. Not even an earlier me, not even one I thought an enemy. I might have detested you for your betrayal but I had at least planned to offer an alternative.\nNEW MASTER: What alternative?\nDECAYED MASTER: You know when people say they wouldn’t wish something upon their own worst enemy? Well... I would.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDECAYED MASTER: And now you know why I brought you here, Doctor.\nNEW MASTER: I see. It is... ingenious.\nDECAYED MASTER: I tried to steal his form in Hexford. It didn’t work out, but it gave me an idea. I return my mind to its original body. You place your mind in the Doctor’s. Take it over, leaving him only one place to retreat to.\nNEW MASTER: That decaying husk.\nDECAYING MASTER: Exactly. He’ll be trapped in this prison of pain for the rest of his life. Which, seeing as he’s in a shrinking island of time and on a ship due to explode very shortly, won’t be more than five minutes, but you can’t have everything.\nDOCTOR: You can’t do this.\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I think we can!\nDECAYED MASTER: Isn’t it glorious? In one fell swoop we’ll be rid of the Doctor, and of this disgusting lump of flesh. Rid of them both. Forever!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 75"

Destroyer of worlds. Murderer of billions.\nNEW MASTER: Oh, stop, stop, you’re making me blush.\nSALRON: The Master? Father Sebastian, we must destroy him. He will betray us!\nSEBASTIAN: No. No, Salron, I do not think he will. If he wished our endeavours neutralized, he could easily have eliminated us when he arrived, when we were not aware of his presence. And yet we still live. Why?\nSALRON: I do not know.\nNEW MASTER: Come on, come on, you can do it.\nSEBASTIAN: He requires something of us...\nNEW MASTER: Exactly, you’re very astute. I suppose that’s why you’re Cult Leader and not just some common or garden cultist, like Salron here.\nSEBASTIAN: Tell us then. What is it that you desire?\nNEW MASTER: Why, like I said. To help you, dear chap, just to help you. What else could I want?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 76\nSEBASTIAN: You are... familiar with my brethren? With our ideology?\nNEW MASTER: Oh yes. The Cult of the Heretic. Quite a cosmopolitan group, aren’t you? I count, what... a dozen species? I have to say, you’ve worked awfully hard to convince the universe you didn’t exist. The false trails, the double bluffs, the secrets and the lies. It would take a genius to untangle them. And it did.\nSEBASTIAN: The universe would destroy us if it knew we were real.\nNEW MASTER: With good reason, I mean, you do want it dead after all. So, thanks to your manipulation and persuasion, you are believed to be a myth, a legend. A bedtime story to scare little ones of all species.\nSEBASTIAN: And yet you found us. You knew the stories were true.\nNEW MASTER: Well. When you’ve allied yourself with as many myths as I have, you learn not to take these things at face value. I found out about the Heretic from the Time Lords’ secret files. He was one of my people, you know?\nSEBASTIAN: So I believe.\nNEW MASTER: And it was my people who killed him. Dissipated his atoms to the\nNEW MASTER: cosmos. They’re like that.\nSALRON: Curse them. Curse the Time Lords!\nNEW MASTER: And that’s your problem, isn’t it? He was rather vital to the scheme. Without Time Lord involvement, his dream could be a little tricky to realise.\nSALRON: We will find a way.\nNEW MASTER: Will you? I mean, seriously, will you? It’ll be an awful lot of faff, experimenting here, investigating there. Why go to all that bother when you’ve got me? Now. Ready to donate my biological data. At a cost.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 77\nSEBASTIAN: What cost?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I think you can guess.\nNEW MASTER: Well?\nSEBASTIAN: We would have conference. You appreciate we cannot make a decision\nSEBASTIAN: of this import without some discussion.\nNEW MASTER: Of course, certainly, don’t mind me, talk as much as you like. I’ve got all day.\nSEBASTIAN: Brethren. Let us leave this place.\nCULTISTS: As you wish.\nNEW MASTER: I’ll just stay here and put my feet up. Don’t worry. I’ve got a good book...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 78\nNEW MASTER: Oh, you’re back. That’s sooner than I expected. I’1l have to save the Great Glass Elevator for another day.\nSEBASTIAN: It is agreed. We will grant you that which you desire. You may rule.\nNEW MASTER: Excellent. I knew I could trust you chaps and chapesses to do the wrong thing.\nSEBASTIAN: Only... there is... a condition.\nNEW MASTER: Don’t try my patience, Sebastian.\nSEBASTIAN: You require something of us; well, we require something of you.\nNEW MASTER: I am not accustomed to taking orders. I am the Master. There’s a clue in the name.\nSEBASTIAN: It is what we need. It is nothing onerous. Merely... a declaration of intent.\nNEW MASTER: I could show you a declaration of intent you wouldn’t be happy with. I am remarkably expert at murder.\nSEBASTIAN: Threaten me all you wish, Time Lord. We are as one. If I die my brethren shall replace me, one by one. They shall make the same request.\nNEW MASTER: Then I’ll reply to them in the same way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 79\nSEBASTIAN: And kill all of us? We are not afraid of death. We serve a higher cause. But you - you need us. You cannot perform this act alone. You need our information, otherwise why come here? — The Time Lords have not been able to create an Anomaly Cage of their own, have they?\nNEW MASTER: I will admit that the Heretic was a unique thinker. His designs have proved impossible for even our finest minds to replicate.\nSEBASTIAN: And if they cannot replicate it, you cannot steal it. We are the only ones offering that technology. Therefore you will not destroy us.\nNEW MASTER: What do you want?\nSEBASTIAN: We want you to kill yourself.\nNEW MASTER: Yes, I’m intrigued by your definition of the phrase ‘nothing onerous’.\nSEBASTIAN: You think too conventionally, Time Lord. You know what the Cage does.\nNEW MASTER: I have the rough idea, yes.\nSEBASTIAN: Then you know such an act will cause you no harm whatsoever.\nNEW MASTER: Is this your first language? I have to see what dictionary you’re using.\nSEBASTIAN: We do not mean you of the now. We mean you of the past.\nNEW MASTER: Oh.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page\nSEBASTIAN: And now you comprehend.\nNEW MASTER: Destroy my past self, change history that completely... my only possible means of survival is through using the Cage.\nSEBASTIAN: Precisely. You must prove your commitment to the cause.\nNEW MASTER: Yeah, that’d do it. Well, it’s ingenious, I’ll give you that.\nSEBASTIAN: But what say you?\nNEW MASTER: You ask a great deal.\nSEBASTIAN: No more than you ask of us. You want the power only we can provide? Prove to us you are worthy of it.\nNEW MASTER: Let me tell you, I am awfully hard to kill.\nSEBASTIAN: Even for you? I believe you're... ‘remarkably expert at murder’.\nNEW MASTER: Touché.\nNEW MASTER: Very well. Most of my former selves have been incompetent wastrels. They got through lives at the drop of a hat. Their continued survival is of little consequence to me. Only my own ongoing existence matters.\nSEBASTIAN: Then you will do it?\nNEW MASTER: Of course I’ll do it! Gladly! If one of them must die a little earlier than otherwise, well... they should have been more careful, shouldn’t they? They deserve to die. Every last one of them.\nSEBASTIAN: Good. Good. Then it is agreed.\nNEW MASTER: Yes. And I know exactly where to do it.\nNEW MASTER: 80\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: 41.

Though I couldn’t have done it without your teleport, Father Sebastian.\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) Low-level technology, I admit. But their defences were designed to combat more sophisticated incursions.\nNEW MASTER: Very clever. Second time I’ve broken into this place. Though that was later in its life, obviously. They really should look into their security. You’re sure you won’t join me? To see the... ‘coup de grace’?\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) Our current location is perfectly adequate. We are not as bloodthirsty as you.\nNEW MASTER: Too scared to leave your little sanctuary, more like.\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) Believe what you wish, we are not sadists. The scanners you have installed will prove sufficient witness. But be quick. Once the deed is done. The second your earlier incarnation is obliterated, your timeline will start unravelling. You will need to make haste for the Anomaly Cage if you wish to survive.\nNEW MASTER: And you’re only going to tell me its location when I’ve killed him. Yes, yes, I know. I mean, really, whatever happened to trust? Go on. You can tell me now. What difference will it make? Didn’t your mothers ever talk to you about sharing?\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) You know the agreement.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 83\nNEW MASTER: Can’t blame a guy for trying. Very well. I will make contact again when the deed is done. Master out.\nNEW MASTER: Though if you think it’ll be as simple as that, you’ve another think coming. Well, now.

I’d almost forgotten what it looked like before...\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Before... what?\nNEW MASTER: I almost regret it. I’ve often wondered what killed me here. My mind was curiously foggy on that point. Turns out it was me... Well, that’s a twist.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: What are you talking about?\nNEW MASTER: You know, I don’t think I’ve ever meant this quite as sincerely before, but believe me - this is nothing personal.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Oh no you don’t —-\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: (...

(CHUCKLES) Did you really believe me so naive as to trust you? An anonymous contact offers vital knowledge leading to the destruction of the Time Lords? Of course it was a trap, I am no fool.\nNEW MASTER: Aren’t you?\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: I am far more intelligent than you will ever be.\nNEW MASTER: Well, you say that — but are you faster? (LEGS IT)\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Stop! Stop!\nNEW MASTER: (RUNNING OFF) Catch me if you can!\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: You think you can escape me. It will be my pleasure to disabuse\nNEW MASTER: you of that notion.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE NEW MASTER CHARGES DOWN THE CORRIDOR. HE RECEIVES A CALL ON\nHIS: COMMUNICATOR. HE ANSWERS IT)\nNEW MASTER: (RUNNING) Yes, Sebastian, what do you want? I’m busy...\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) Your sensors indicate your younger self is still alive. Things do not appear to be going to plan. It seems you underestimated him.\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I don’t think so. If there’s one person in the universe I never underestimate, it’s myself. I have the highest possible opinion of me.\nSEBASTIAN: (DISTORT) Then this is -\nNEW MASTER: - all part of the plan, yes. So if you’ll forgive me -\nNEW MASTER: Now where - ah, yes.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: You cannot hide. I will find you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Your agonising demise is merely a matter of - Aaaargggh!\nDOCTOR WHO: (HE’S BEEN CAUGHT IN A FIELD OF ENERGY —- LIKE AN ELECTRIC FENCE. IT BURNS. THE NEW MASTER EMERGES FROM WITHIN THE ROOM)\nNEW MASTER: There, that’s better.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: What have you done? What is this?\nNEW MASTER: A Malson Electrofield. A sort of energy net. Very nasty. You won’t be able to move, so don’t bother trying. I out-thought you, you see. You anticipated my betrayal, well, I anticipated your anticipation. Factored it in. You’re very easy to trick, dear boy. We think the same way.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: I will escape this mesh. And you will regret your actions.\nNEW MASTER: No, don’t think so. It was never going to be the TCE, I knew that. That’s not how it happened, the first time. I remember. I was burnt. Burnt to a crisp.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: What say you?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, don’t worry. You’1ll work it out. Eventually. Now, let’s see, how does this thing work?\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Yaaarggggh!\nNEW MASTER: Oh, does that hurt? Yes, I suppose it does. Look, sorry about all this, but I really am acting in your best interests.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Yaaarrrghhhh!\nNEW MASTER: This is for your own good you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Yaaargggggh!\nNEW MASTER: Don’t shout. I’m trying to concentrate! This is a very delicate operation. I need you left a fraction above death...\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: Yaaaargggghhhhh!\nNEW MASTER: .then if I abandon your dying body, they’ll think I’ve fulfilled my side of the bargain... but they don’t know what happens next. If I Signal Gallifrey, a certain Chancellor might just wing his way over here and rescue you. Everyone wins. I’m doing you a favour, really.\nNEW MASTER: PRE-DECAYED MASTER: (GOING INTO A SLUMP) Yaaaarrrggggghhhh...!!!\nNEW MASTER: Ah. Yes. Looks like that’s the ticket. Well. All I have to do now is - (BLASTED FROM BEHIND) Urgh!\nNEW MASTER: What in - (HE’S BLASTED AGAIN) Urgh!\nNEW MASTER: (HE DROPS.

We have.\nSALRON: Do you require assistance?\nDECAYED MASTER: Where did you come from?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 90\nSEBASTIAN: We teleported in shortly after he did. But we waited. Out of Sight. For just this moment.\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh?\nSEBASTIAN: Remove the other one, Salron.\nSALRON: Brothers, help me.\nDECAYED MASTER: What are you doing with hinm...?\nSEBASTIAN: Taking him to our domain. You may follow. And see.\nSEBASTIAN: Oh. Of course. You must be close to death. I will assist you. Be\nSEBASTIAN: careful - the teleport may prove painfull...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 91\nDECAYED MASTER: Please, I... cannot live long... like this...\nSEBASTIAN: Long enough, I would hope.\nDECAYED MASTER: What is this place?\nSEBASTIAN: Our cloisters. Come. This way...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: (SEBASTIAN HELPS THE DECAYED MASTER IN. A BIG MACHINE WHIRRS OFF. THE NEW MASTER IS BEING PLACED WITHIN)\nSEBASTIAN: Ah. All is nearly prepared.\nDECAYED MASTER: What have you done to him?\nSEBASTIAN: Nothing. Yet. Is... ‘he’... installed correctly?\nSALRON: Very soon.\nSEBASTIAN: And we have the required biodata?\nSALRON: The scan is running, it will soon complete.\nSEBASTIAN: Good.\nDECAYED MASTER: What is that machine...?\nSEBASTIAN: A mental transference unit.\nDECAYED MASTER: I do not understand.\nSEBASTIAN: He tried to murder you. He failed. What sweet revenge it would be for you to place his mind inside your expiring body and... take over his?\nDECAYED MASTER: I could... I could do that?\nSEBASTIAN: Oh yes. Through that machine, it is simplicity itself. And your only possible means of survival.\nDECAYED MASTER: This is my last regeneration. If this body dies...\nSEBASTIAN: I know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 93\nSALRON: We will save you.\nDECAYED MASTER: Save me? Why would you do that?\nSEBASTIAN: Why? Because it is the right thing to do.\nDECAYED MASTER: The right thing? No. No-one would help me live through pure altruism. You have some ulterior motive...\nSEBASTIAN: Whether we do or not hardly matters. We are your only option for survival. Well?\nDECAYED MASTER: Who was he? Why did he wish to kill me?\nSEBASTIAN: Does it matter?\nDECAYED MASTER: No. It does not. (BEAT) Do it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: (DECAYED MASTER IS BEING PLUGGED INTO THE MACHINE — METAL CLAMPS ETC)\nSALRON: There. He is ready.\nDECAYED MASTER: Will the procedure be quick? This body has little time left...\nSEBASTIAN: It shall be quick enough. We may proceed.\nDECAYED MASTER: Will it hurt?\nSEBASTIAN: Probably.\nSEBASTIAN: (HE SLAMS A LEVER DOWN. BIG BURST OF ENERGY, BUZZING. THE MASTERS REACT IN AGONY )\nNEW: MASTER/DECAYED MASTER: Gaaaah!\nSEBASTIAN: Do not worry. All goes precisely to plan. You may feel agony now, but in time, you will never have existed at all. So it matters not.\nDECAYED MASTER: (JUST HOLDING ON, GRITTED TEETH) Never... have... existed?\nSEBASTIAN: No one will. Apart from us. The universe is sick, my friend. Soon,\nSEBASTIAN: very soon... it shall regenerate.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: (FADE UP REPRISE OF 38. THE MASTERS ARE BACK IN THEIR ALTERNATIVE PERSONALITIES. THE ALERT CONTINUES IN THE BACKGROUND)\nDECAYED MASTER: [..] I return my mind to its original body. You place your mind in the Doctor’s. Take it over, leaving him only one place to retreat to.\nNEW MASTER: That decaying husk.\nDECAYING MASTER: Exactly. He’ll be trapped in this prison of pain for the rest of his life. Which, seeing as he’s in a shrinking island of time and on a ship due to explode very shortly, won’t be more than five minutes, but you can’t have everything.\nDOCTOR: You can’t do this.\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I think we can!\nDECAYED MASTER: Isn’t it glorious? In one fell swoop we’ll be rid of the Doctor, and of this disgusting lump of flesh. Rid of them both. Forever!\nDOCTOR: No, I mean you really can’t do this. It’s impossible.\nDECAYED MASTER: Don’t try to bluff us, Doctor, you will fail.\nNEW MASTER: To us, nothing is impossible.\nDOCTOR: Think about it. The gaps in history. The blank pages, if you like.\nDECAYED MASTER: What about them?\nNEW MASTER: Blank pages?\nDOCTOR: Those islands of time your other self mentioned. Time is being wiped out. Patches of non-time spreading everywhere, everywhen. Throughout the universe. Like a disease.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 96\nDECAYED MASTER: They’re not important. We’ve flown around them before, we’ll fly around them again. Just in slightly different bodies.\nDOCTOR: Oh, will you? Are you sure? Time itself is being erased. Isn’t it obvious why?\nNEW MASTER: No, but I’m sure you will inform us of the answer in your usual oh So superior way.\nDOCTOR: It’s you two. It’s your fault.\nDECAYED MASTER: Doctor, if I was destroying the universe, I think I’d know about it, I’ve done it often enough.\nDOCTOR: That body, there. The later model.\nNEW MASTER: Me?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It only exists because the earlier you didn’t possess it now. The earlier you, the one inside there, was left to die on Terserus, and eventually regenerated into that form. It’s your future self from a timeline where this didn’t happen.\nDECAYED MASTER: I suppose so.\nNEW MASTER: Go on.\nDOCTOR: So by taking over it now, you make it an impossibility. It can no longer be created. And if it can’t be created, it can’t be there to be taken over. You see where I’m going with this? It’s sort of like killing your own grandfather. Only in reverse.\nNEW MASTER: I... see...\nDOCTOR: You’re now both walking temporal anomalies. In your current forms you cannot exist, yet you do. And you know how time abhors a paradox.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 97\nDECAYED MASTER: You think that’s what’s causing the time breaks?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you? You want proof? You both claim to have met me recently in some of my earlier incarnations. Well, I have no memory of those meetings. Almost as if history is breaking down around those points. The points you’ve travelled to as you presently are.\nNEW MASTER: This is all speculation. There’s no temporal theory to the effect.\nDOCTOR: Because there’s no precedent for this level of madness. You’re acting like a computer virus on time - a ‘reality virus’, if you will. Wherever you go, you infect it. The longer you stay in the wrong bodies, you’re destroying all history.\nDECAYED MASTER: As long as we stay in the wrong bodies, precisely. But we have no intention of remaining in them. When we return, the effect will cease.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but you’re not returning, are you? Not both of you. You want to place his mind in my head. That won’t stop it. That’s still not what happened in your past, I can’t regenerate into this latest you. One of you will still be an impossibility, so the effect will\nDOCTOR: continue.\nNEW MASTER: Do you believe him?\nDECAYED MASTER: This incarnation of the Doctor is a wily one. He could be lying.\nDOCTOR: Can you take the risk? If I’m right, and you ignore me, the universe will collapse around you. Rather a pyrrhic victory, wouldn’t you say?\nNEW MASTER: I can’t return. Not to that decaying monstrosity. I can’t.\nDECAYED MASTER: It need not be for long.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: Far be it from me to interrupt your delicate negotiations, but might I remind you that we’re on a spaceship that’s crashing into a hypertunnel? And rapidly approaching a period of non-existence? You really don’t have the time for detailed deliberations. You can make your choice later. For now, I have to fly us out of here.\nNEW MASTER: You? Why can’t we just leave you here?\nDOCTOR: Because I don’t believe your TARDIS was damaged by traversing the empty time periods.\nDECAYED MASTER: Mine?\nDOCTOR: You remember, you said you were having difficulty piloting it? I believe it’s been reacting to you just like the universe has. By breaking down. If you try to fly mine, you’ll hurt it just as badly.\nDECAYED MASTER: You can’t know that.\nDOCTOR: Maybe not, but there’s an easy way to find out. You didn’t know about the gaps, did you?\nNEW MASTER: Me?\nDOCTOR: Yes. So you can’t have flown through them. How’s your TARDIS been working?\nNEW MASTER: It has had... some difficulties.\nDOCTOR: See? You need me.\nNEW MASTER: No. No we don’t.\nDOCTOR: You... don’t?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, my dear Doctor. You have miscalculated.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 99\nDECAYED MASTER: (GETTING IT) Ah, of course, yes, that is magnificent!\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand.\nNEW MASTER: I hate existing as a walking corpse, existing in that husk of a body. But I hate you more. The one thing that could persuade me to return to it... is the guarantee of your death. Contact!\nDECAYED MASTER: Contact!\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 100\nDECAYED MASTER: Come now. It’s time to come home.\nNEW MASTER: Yes. Yes I suppose it is.\nNEW MASTER: (AND WITH A ROAR OF ENERGY, NOT UNLIKE THE ANDROZANI REGENERATION, THEIR MINDS TRANSFER AND WITH A BANG —- )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE MASTERS HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR ORIGINAL FORMS — ‘STANDARD’ PERFORMANCES FROM THIS POINT)\nNEW MASTER: Oh, yes. Yes, that’s more like it. Thank you! It’s good to be back.\nDOCTOR: No.\nDECAYED MASTER: Ah. This familiar cage... (REMEMBERS SOMETHING) Cage... Something about... a cage.. Why do I remember that?\nDOCTOR: You can’t leave me here.\nNEW MASTER: You’re really not an expert on what we can and can’t do, are you, Doctor? Leaving you on a warship that’s going to crash into a hypertunnel and explode is very much within our remit.\nDOCTOR: But there’s more to it than that! The universe is dying. History is dying. You’ve nowhere to run.\nDECAYED MASTER: (GASP OF REALISATION) Ah, I believe we do! The Anomaly Cage!\nNEW MASTER: The what?\nDECAYED MASTER: I saw it in your mind as a place of safety! But the details are... unclear... What is an Anomaly Cage?\nNEW MASTER: I’ve no idea what you’re banging on about, I’ve never heard of an — (MEMORY RETURNING) Ah! Yes! The fog clears. The Cult! The Cult of the Heretic! Of course. A bit of contact’s always good for defragging the old noggin.\nDOCTOR: The Cult of the Heretic. Oh, this just gets worse.\nNEW MASTER: For you, maybe. I’m kind of alright with it all.\nDECAYED MASTER: What is this Cult?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 102\nNEW MASTER: I’ll explain later. But I think we’ve uncovered who thought to betray us...\nDECAYED MASTER: It was they who sent the assassins? The Dragonhunters? The Trans- human Sisters of the Unholy Protocol?\nNEW MASTER: Yes, at a guess. I must say, I don’t like it when people try to kill me. It’s so terribly impolite. But, yes, I think the Anomaly Cage should prove perfectly adequate for our requirements.\nDECAYED MASTER: Thank you for your assistance, Doctor, but we have no further need of your input. You will shortly die.\nNEW MASTER: But don’t let that trouble you. So will everything else in recorded history. With two rather handsome exceptions.\nDOCTOR: Think about what you’re doing.\nNEW MASTER: Thinking about it, perfectly fine with it. So now, old me. Shall I tell you what I did with your TARDIS? So we can scooch off out of here?\nDECAYED MASTER: Oh, no, no, I have a better idea. Why not take the Doctor’s?\nDECAYED MASTER: He might find some way out of his ropes, and use his own ship to escape. He doesn’t know where mine is, so if we steal his we eliminate his only opportunity for egress.\nNEW MASTER: Ooh. I like the way you think. So ruthless. So vengeful. So... me. His ship it is, then.\nDOCTOR: Jemima will stop you.\nNEW MASTER: Really? She might struggle to do that when she’s dead.\nDOCTOR: You killed her?\nNEW MASTER: I think so. They all blend into one after a while.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 103\nDECAYED MASTER: You killed his companion? Oh, I’ve always wanted to do that.\nNEW MASTER: I've a feeling she was new, I’m not sure she counts.\nDOCTOR: There was no need to kill her!\nNEW MASTER: Oh, need, need, need. That’s your answer every time, isn’t it? ‘You didn’t need to do that’. What an inane response. Well, of course I didn’t need to do it, you cretin, I never need to do it. If I needed to do it, it wouldn’t be fun.\nDECAYED MASTER: I have no need to kill you either, Doctor. But that will not stop me. Goodbye. You will not be missed.\nNEW MASTER: Love to all my victims.\nDECAYED MASTER: Where’s the key?\nNEW MASTER: What key?\nDECAYED MASTER: His key.\nNEW MASTER: His key, you had it last, didn’t you?\nDECAYED MASTER: No, you did.\nNEW MASTER: I rather think not. You hid it, remember, I recall you saying exactly that.\nDECAYED MASTER: No, you hid it when you were possessing my body. You heard my voice, but it was you saying it.\nNEW MASTER: I - actually, you may be right.\nDOCTOR: Gosh, this is all needlessly complicated, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 104\nNEW MASTER: In that incarnation, you can talk. - Oh, of course! That’s where I put it!\nDECAYED MASTER: You left it in the Doctor’s pocket?\nNEW MASTER: Don’t overthink things.\nDOCTOR: Are you quite finished?\nNEW MASTER: Goodbye, Doctor.\nDECAYED MASTER: Goodbye.\nDECAYED MASTER: (THEY ENTER THE TARDIS.

No-one would help me without reason.\nSEBASTIAN: We are a religious order. We seek the good of all.\nNEW MASTER: And yet you are willing to eliminate my attacker?\nSEBASTIAN: There is no good in him.

It’s the gaps in time. These readings suggest they’re increasing in number. Spreading. There’s precious little of history left.\nDECAYED MASTER: Even though we have returned to our original bodies.\nNEW MASTER: Seemingly so. I suppose once the sickness enters and multiplies, it hardly matters if the original germ is neutralised. We infected the universe and now the illness spreads.\nDECAYED MASTER: And you believe this all to be the work of the... ‘Cult of the Heretic’?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, undoubtedly. It fits their objectives to aT.\nDECAYED MASTER: You said you would explain who they were.\nNEW MASTER: Yes, yes, of course I did. Sorry, forgot. The Heretic was one of our kind, you see. Back in the day. He was executed. Or sent to Shada. I’m not entirely sure which, the records on the subject aren’t exactly comprehensive. But the important thing is that he didn’t wholly subscribe to the traditional orthodoxy of our people.\nDECAYED MASTER: That much would seem apparent from the name.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 116\nNEW MASTER: Yes. Good point. Although it didn’t seem that way initially. He didn’t head out into the universe to start mucking about with it like you, me, the Doctor, and everyone. No, he sat at home, like a good little Gallifreyan and observed. And it was what he observed that was the problem.\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes?\nNEW MASTER: He saw a universe that was sick. Spoilt and ruined by its own inhabitants, mortally wounded. There was no good in it, only evil.\nDECAYED MASTER: They say that of me too.\nNEW MASTER: He saw violence, anger, war and death, everywhere he looked. An eternity gone wrong. It revolted him. And he resolved to put it right.\nDECAYED MASTER: How?\nNEW MASTER: The only way a Time Lord would think to cure the mortally wounded. Regeneration.\nDECAYED MASTER: He wanted to regenerate the universe?\nNEW MASTER: In a nutshell, yes. Destroy it all and replace it with something better of his own devising.\nDECAYED MASTER: Even I have not had the audacity to attempt the destruction of everything.\nNEW MASTER: Well, you’ve got to have ambitions, haven’t you? But actually, it wasn’t quite everything. As he and his followers considered themselves the only healthy beings in the cosmos, he decreed their right to survive.\nDECAYED MASTER: Through using this Anomaly Cage.\nNEW MASTER: Exactly. You’re very smart, I could grow to like you.\nDECAYED MASTER: Get on with it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 117\nNEW MASTER: Although you can go off people. (BEAT) The Cage protects you from the manipulation of time. It rewrites it around you, shapes it to fit. Destroy your own history and you remain unaffected. Paradoxes drift past like a summer breeze.\nDECAYED MASTER: So it is what you would use to survive disrupting your own past by, to pick an example at random, murdering an earlier iteration of yourself?\nNEW MASTER: You’re not still angry about that, are you? Oh come on, you’re alive. That makes it attempted murder at worst, get it right.\nDECAYED MASTER: Attempted murder? Merely attempted? You expect me to revel in your incompetence? I would not have attempted, I would have succeeded.\nNEW MASTER: Whatever happened to forgive and forget?\nDECAYED MASTER: You tried to kill me. Condemned me to exist as a living curse. If you were anyone else I would not be standing here talking to you, you would be dead.\nNEW MASTER: And that’s precisely the point. I’m you and you’re me and we’re both still here. That’s why I picked Terserus. Because I knew you survived it, it’s what happened to me! In my past. The Cult would think I was doing their bidding, but in reality I was just leaving things the way they always were.\nDECAYED MASTER: Really? Do you expect applause for this piece of cunning? Appreciation?\nNEW MASTER: I expect gratitude. If someone was going to leave you like that, wouldn’t you rather it was me that was responsible, instead of the Doctor? Or some random chap off the street?\nDECAYED MASTER: I would rather pain did not course through my every nerve at even the slightest movement.\nNEW MASTER: You’re not going to let this one go, are you? Shall we just say the Cult fogged my mind or something and forget about it?\nDECAYED MASTER: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 118\nNEW MASTER: Excellent. Where were we? Ah, yes. The Cage. The Heretic had only got as far as the design stage when the Time Lords caught up with him. He’d swanned off into the great wide yonder to found his religion, you see. Gathering followers from myriad races. Had it been built, all he’d require was a catalyst to initiate the collapse of the universe, then some of his own Time Lord biodata to trigger its regeneration. The latter proved tricky when he was killed, obviously.\nDECAYED MASTER: So we provided a replacement?\nNEW MASTER: I can’t imagine they wouldn’t have stolen the biodata from one of us when we were in their power. And our temporal displacement provided the infection they required as the catalyst. We were the computer virus that disrupts the system before they reboot it.\nDECAYED MASTER: We gave them everything.\nNEW MASTER: And they left us to die. Yes, it’s the ingratitude that hurts the most. Fortunately, revenge isn’t far behind them.\nDECAYED MASTER: I hope not. I do not believe the Doctor’s ship is built for much more of this. We cannot traverse the no-time endlessly. We will eventually be destroyed.\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I don’t doubt it, but I’m not merely hoping our vengeance is close. I’m speaking from a point of certainty. You see -\nNEW MASTER: I’ve found the Cage.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: (SEBASTIAN ADDRESSING THE CULTISTS. A REASONABLY SIZED ROOM IN A\nSPACESHIP: TYPE ENVIRONMENT, SOME LIGHT TECHNOLOGY ACTIVE. MONITORS HUM, READOUTS BEEP)\nSEBASTIAN: This is a wondrous day. The day we have prepared for for many years. The day of regeneration. All praise the Heretic!\nCULTISTS: All praise the Heretic!\nSEBASTIAN: Our catalyst has triggered the obliteration of time. It is only we who will survive. It shall be our great task to remake the universe. Build it anew. And build it better.\nCULTISTS: All praise the Heretic!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: (COMPUTERS TICKING OVER. THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. THE MASTERS EXIT, CLOSING DOOR BEHIND)\nNEW MASTER: This place was remarkably easy to locate, of course. They’ve built a craft to withstand the obliteration of the universe. So, when history itself is vanishing, you simply scan the dead sections of time and voila. The Cage will be hidden in the real universe, but in the gaps it’ll be the only thing you can find. Clever, eh?\nDECAYED MASTER: Yes, you’re very ingenious.\nNEW MASTER: You can’t wait to be me, can you?\nDECAYED MASTER: Their domain is... bigger than I expected.\nNEW MASTER: They only call it a Cage. It doesn’t have bars. It’s sort of a Space-time craft. Only it flies through paradoxes rather than the vortex.\nDECAYED MASTER: I see. So our intentions now are to kill the entire Cult as painfully as possible and take this ship over? Then reboot the universe in our own image?\nNEW MASTER: You know, that’s exactly what I was thinking. Those very words. We’re incredibly simpatico.\nDECAYED MASTER: So if that is our intent, we should proceed with alacrity, yes? These appear to be environment controls... if you’re correct that the Cult consists of multiple species, the atmosphere here must be carefully balanced and controlled. If we interfere with the air\nDECAYED MASTER: supply...\nNEW MASTER: Ooh. Yes. Now that’s my kind of plan!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 121\nSEBASTIAN: Through carefully managed application of the catalyst’s biological data we can shape our new creation in any way we desire. The choices are, literally, infinite.\nSALRON: Father. Sensors register a forcefield breach.\nSEBASTIAN: Calm, calm. This is easily solved.\nSALRON: But if the shields fail, there’ll be nothing to protect us from the temporal erosion.\nSEBASTIAN: Such a breach is impossible. There is nothing outside to invade us. This is a glitch in the system, nothing more.\nSEBASTIAN: Where is this so called breach?\nSALRON: The second storeroom.\nSEBASTIAN: Then kindly investigate the issue, Salron. And repair it.\nSALRON: I obey.\nSEBASTIAN: There must be no mistakes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE MASTERS ARE OPERATING COMPUTER CONTROLS. CULTIST IS\nAPPROACHING: OUTSIDE)\nNEW MASTER: Now, if we attach the extraction lines to the -\nDECAYED MASTER: Wait.\nDECAYED MASTER: Someone approaches.\nNEW MASTER: Excellent. I think we know what to do\nDECAYED MASTER: I look forward to it.\nNEW MASTER: Hello there!\nSALRON: You?\nNEW MASTER: about them, don’t we?\nNEW MASTER: Page 122\nNEW MASTER: Yes, us! Good to see you again. Brother Salron, isn’t it? Are you Still one of that ‘Cult of the Heretic’ mob? Wanting to regenerate the entire universe? Such an insane scheme. Maybe you need to see\nNEW MASTER: (THE DECAYED MASTER SHOOTS CULTIST 2,\nSALRON: Aaaagh!\nSHRINKING: HIM DOWN)\nSHRINKING: Why did you do that? I was in the middle of a bit!\nDECAYED MASTER: You were wasting time. There is no need for prattle.\nNEW MASTER: I wasn’t prattling, I was building to something.\nDECAYED MASTER: He needed to die. He might have alerted the others.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 123\nNEW MASTER: ‘Maybe you need to see a shrink’! That’s what I was going to say.\nNEW MASTER: Because it would have been quite amusing. You know. With ‘shrink’ being slang for a psychiatrist? And because I was going to ‘shrink’ him? It would have been, sort of... a pun. You understand?\nDECAYED MASTER: Are you finished?\nNEW MASTER: With this audience, certainly.\nDECAYED MASTER: Then get on with it. I desire their deaths to be as painful as possible.\nNEW MASTER: (BITTERLY) Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 124\nSEBASTIAN: There, my brethren. It is done. All history... has been erased. Praise be the Heretic!\nCULTISTS: Praise be the Heretic!\nSEBASTIAN: It is time for his dream to become a reality. It is now but the simple matter of generating a replacement. Converting the Time Lord’s regeneration energies and starting everything anew. Making it all... better.\nSEBASTIAN: We must choose the new existence carefully. We will be its creators, we will be as gods. We should tread carefully with that responsibility. Be benevolent rulers in his name. All hail the Heretic!\nCULTISTS: (CHOKING) All... hail... Gah! Air!\nSEBASTIAN: My... brethren... what... ails you? (COUGHS) What...\nSEBASTIAN: (STRUGGLING TO SPEAK) What treachery is this? Who has... betrayed usS...?\nNEW MASTER: As if you need to ask.\nSEBASTIAN: (WEAK) No...\nDECAYED MASTER: All dead. All bar hin...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 125\nNEW MASTER: Yes. I went for a slightly unusual mix to air. Fatal to everyone except him. Humans aren’t killed, they’re just left incapacitated. didn’t want it to be quick. I want him to see his murderers. Understand his error of judgement.\nDECAYED MASTER: Ah, I see. That is the price he must pay for his treachery. He must... suffer. I am glad. (TO SEBASTIAN) Hello. I believe I made you a promise...\nSEBASTIAN: You... two...\nNEW MASTER: Yes! Me! Us! Fancy seeing you here, Sebastian! Isn’t ita -\nSEBASTIAN: Aaargh!\nNEW MASTER: Oh come on! Can you allow me to say at least one?\nDECAYED MASTER: Let me guess. ‘Fancy seeing you here. Isn’t it a small world’.\nNEW MASTER: No, that wasn’t it.\nDECAYED MASTER: What was it then?\nDECAYED MASTER: Honestly, why do you persist with this witless juvenilia? Or do you truly believe the death agonies they feel when their bodies are crushed down to Lilliputian size are as nothing unless they\nDECAYED MASTER: are also forced to listen to an inane play on words?\nNEW MASTER: I find it amusing.\nDECAYED MASTER: I do not kill to amuse myself. I kill for power.\nNEW MASTER: Kill joy more like. You know, you used to be fun. Back when it was\nNEW MASTER: all pointy beards and nehru jackets. Whatever happened to that?\nNEW MASTER: I\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 126\nDECAYED MASTER: You happened.\nNEW MASTER: Am I really going to be stuck ruling a new universe with you? Out of all my other incarnations, this is the version I end up with? Couldn’t I have had Mister Velveteen, or the snake?\nDECAYED MASTER: You picked me. This regeneration. You picked me. This was not my choice.\nNEW MASTER: Well, just try to enjoy yourself, can’t you? Find some pleasure in your work. This is all we’ve ever wanted, isn’t it? Through this mental interface we design our new universe. Throw this lever and the regeneration energies force it into being. All history. At our fingertips. If you can’t smile at that when can you?\nDECAYED MASTER: It is... that simple?\nNEW MASTER: The Heretic knew his stuff. Think about it. Every single life.\nNEW MASTER: Ours to control. We are the Masters... and they will obey us!\nDECAYED MASTER: I suppose it is... good.\nNEW MASTER: It’s not good, it’s magnificent! Every one else, ever... dead! An entire new universe ready to be born under our rule! An eternity to command. And best of all - no Doctor!\nDECAYED MASTER: What - is - that?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, you have got to be kidding me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 127\nDECAYED MASTER: No! Another TARDIS!\nNEW MASTER: Yes. I think it might be mine.\nDOCTOR: Hello boys. Did you miss me?\nDECAYED MASTER: Doctor!\nNEW MASTER: How did you find us?\nDECAYED MASTER: How did you get here?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it was simplicity itself. You were heading for something that could survive the erasure of history. So once history had been erased, your location would be pretty easy to ascertain.\nNEW MASTER: Of course.\nDECAYED MASTER: Much the same technique as we used.\nNEW MASTER: But the spaceship! It was crashing into the Hypertunnel! You could never have found my TARDIS quickly enough.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I didn’t need to. I was in the missile bay, remember? I merely hopped inside one missile and shot myself into space, out of range of the explosion.\nNEW MASTER: Ah. I see.\nDOCTOR: When the Gorlan ship was destroyed, your TARDIS was one of the few items to remain unscathed. As the missiles were energy seeking, and TARDISes use a lot of energy -\nNEW MASTER: You would have flown straight to it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: Correct.\nDOCTOR: And since you’d very helpfully left me a portable force-field generator -\nDECAYED MASTER: You did what?\nNEW MASTER: No! Yes. Well, maybe I did, but there was no harm in it! I couldn’t see the thing being of any use to him, it was almost out of power.\nDOCTOR: Fortunately it still retained enough to enable me to reach your ship. Which was damaged from having you fly it so breaking in was an easy job. I simply had to use my own key, the lock wasn’t in great shape.\nNEW MASTER: Very clever.\nDECAYED MASTER: Ingenious.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDECAYED MASTER: But it is the last moment of ingenuity you will ever display. Anything you wish to say before the execution?\nDOCTOR: Well, I -\nDECAYED MASTER: Not you. Me.\nNEW MASTER: Really?\nDECAYED MASTER: In this particular case I am willing to make an exception.\nNEW MASTER: Why thank you. Most kind. Doctor. You are, quite literally, no fun any more. Your life expectancy is extremely short.\nNEW: MASTER/DECAYED MASTER: Goodbye, Doctor!!!\nNEW: (THEY BOTH SHOOT HIM WITH THEIR TCES. BUT THE BLASTS BOUNCE OF AN\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 129\nENERGY: FIELD)\nNEW MASTER: What on —- ?\nDECAYED MASTER: Why is he not - ?\nDOCTOR: Oh, did I not say? Your adaptation of the TARDIS forcefields clued me in on how to make my own portable version. The original might have run out of juice... but the one from this TARDIS, your other TARDIS, has no such trouble.\nDECAYED MASTER: You’re the gift that keeps on giving, aren’t you?\nNEW MASTER: I could hardly have expected that.\nDOCTOR: Trouble in paradise? Stands to reason I suppose... What’s through here...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR: The assembled Cult of the Heretic, I presume. All dead. Will no amount of bodies ever satisfy your hunger for destruction?\nNEW MASTER: Oh, I think our current tally of ‘everyone in history who ever lived’ is probably sufficient.\nDECAYED MASTER: Not quite everyone. The Doctor remains a glaring admission in our list of victims. But that forcefield cannot last long. Soon it will decay.\nNEW MASTER: So all we need do is wait. Then we can complete the set.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you’re very patient. And with history dead, you’ve a lot of time to fill...\nNEW MASTER: Oh, my dear Doctor, history isn’t dead. It’s merely resting...\nDOCTOR: Before being restored in whatever way you desire. Is this the equipment designed to program the regeneration?\nDECAYED MASTER: Step away from those controls.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn’t worry. That’s the problem with this forcefield. I can’t actually touch anything.\nNEW MASTER: So you can’t interfere?\nDOCTOR: No.\nNEW MASTER: Ha! Oh, this is delightful! And the moment the forcefield drops, we kill you.\nDECAYED MASTER: You survived the explosion merely to join us here and experience a more personal form of death.\nNEW MASTER: Glorious!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR: Well. The rest of time was destroyed. Where else was I going to go? (HE WALKS AROUND) I’ll say one thing for the Cult, they knew their stuff.\nDECAYED MASTER: You were already aware of them, weren’t you?\nDOCTOR: I helped stopped the Heretic himself. Many years ago. Or last week. One or the other. I’m not really sure. I thought the rest of the Cult had been neutralised.\nNEW MASTER: Well, they have been now, yes.\nDOCTOR: Am I to understand that the pair of you plan to restore history in your own image?\nDECAYED MASTER: Correct.\nNEW MASTER: We haven’t quite finessed the precise details yet, but yes, that’s the basic idea.\nDOCTOR: And which one of you will be in charge?\nDECAYED: MASTER/NEW MASTER: Me. (THEN MORE INSISTENT, TO EACH OTHER) Me!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought this might happen. That’s the trouble with meeting your others selves. You don’t always get on. Trust someone who knows.\nDECAYED MASTER: Mere teething troubles. We shall rule in harmony.\nNEW MASTER: We shall rule together!\nDOCTOR: Really? Are you certain of that? There can be only one Master, surely? By definition. There’s a clue in the name.\nNEW MASTER: I see what you’re doing, Doctor.\nDECAYED MASTER: You are trying to sow discord between us. You will fail.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: I’m just stating the facts. If the pair of you reboot the universe and take charge together, well... you’1l just confuse your new subjects. No man can be the servant of two masters, no matter what Goldoni might think.\nNEW MASTER: They will learn.\nDOCTOR: And can you really submit to the will of the other? You have very different personalities. I’m sure you’ll disagree on matters of importance. Who gets final say? With only two of you there is no casting vote.\nDECAYED MASTER: You think I would argue with my own self?\nDOCTOR: I suspect you already have.\nNEW MASTER: You know, he’s sort of got a point.\nDECAYED MASTER: He might be correct, to a degree.\nNEW MASTER: Yes. Maybe it’d be best if you stuck to the... administrative side. Kept to the shadows.\nDECAYED MASTER: Me? Whilst you rule, I suppose?\nNEW MASTER: Well naturally, you’ve not got the face for politics...\nNEW MASTER: (THE DOCTOR PUTS IN SOME EARPLUGS AND QUIETLY TAKES OUT THE BOX\nFROM: PART TWO. HE STARTS PROGRAMMING IT - VERY QUIET TAPPING)\nDECAYED MASTER: I would strike fear into the hearts of our subjects. The universe will hardly quake in terror at the commands of a low ranking civil servant like you.\nNEW MASTER: Oh come on, this is what leaders look like these days. You, that face, you’re completely unelectable.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 133\nDECAYED MASTER: With the anomaly cage in operation, I will be able to absorb a new form. A new face. I need never become you.\nNEW MASTER: Now, that’s just spiteful -\nNEW MASTER: (THE DOCTOR OPERATES THE BOX. A TONE RINGS OUT, SIMILAR TO THAT USED TO DESTROY THE GORLANS IN EPISODE TWO)\nDECAYED: MASTER/NEW MASTER:\nNEW MASTER: (AGONISED) What is -\nDOCTOR: I might not be able to emerge from the forcefield. But I’1ll tell you one thing that can leave it. Sound waves. Obviously.\nDECAYED MASTER: (AGONISED) That... box...\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s the one you gave me to destroy the Gorlans, remember? Or\nDOCTOR: was it you? I’ve lost track... Anyway, I figured out how to operate as\nNEW MASTER: (AGONISED) You let him keep that? You witless imbecile!\nDECAYED MASTER: I haven’t forgotten the forcefield.\nDECAYED: MASTER/NEW MASTER:\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, the forcefield, of course.\nDOCTOR: With you incapacitated temporarily, I don’t think I need it any more. Yes, it was an easy job to adjust the settings of this thing. So it would hurt you two rather than kill Gorlans.\nDECAYED MASTER: But not you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. I put some earplugs in just now. I’m very good at lip- reading. That should be enough... (HE SWITCHES IT OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 134\nNEW MASTER: You - are - infuriating...\nDOCTOR: Aren’t I? It seems both of you have sown the seeds of your own defeat. I’ve used your own murder devices against you. You are, quite literally, your own worst enemy...\nDECAYED MASTER: I will destroy you!\nDOCTOR: Maybe tomorrow, eh? Now... these controls. A mental interface, eh? Seems simple enough...\nDOCTOR: Yes. Throw this lever, and I get to remake the universe any way I want. Oh, the power. So many options -\nNEW MASTER: (PAINED) That should have been us!\nDOCTOR: But it’s not. If you two were like a computer virus, infecting the system... a reboot isn’t the only option. Why not just switch it off and on again? Restart everything exactly as it was?\nDECAYED MASTER: No - you cannot waste this opportunity!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it’s a waste. The Heretic thought the universe was Sick. Maybe it was. But that just means it needs a Doctor.\nNEW: MASTER/DECAYED MASTER:\nNEW: (IN THE EMPTINESS OF NO-TIME, REGENERATION ENERGY BLAZES OUT,\nFIRING: EVERYWHERE, SOMETHING BETWEEN A TRIUMPHANT ORGAN CHORD AND A MASSIVE LIGHT BLAZING INTO LIGHT.

The gaps all repaired. History returned. Everything just as it was before the Cult started interfering.\nNEW MASTER: You fool! You could have had anything! Fixed it in any way you desired! Eradicated the Daleks! Removed the Cybermen! Saved the Gorlans, saved Jemima!\nDOCTOR: If I play God I become you. And I really wouldn’t want to do that.\nDECAYED MASTER: (FADING) Then I hope you are happy in yourself! Because it shall be your last action! You have no forcefield now!\nNEW MASTER: (FADING) Do you truly think you’ll have time to use that box again?\nDOCTOR: No, but I won’t need to. I dealt with you two, also.\nDECAYED MASTER: (FADING) What say you, I - ? No! What is happening!\nNEW MASTER: (FADING) I can’t see you - you’re fading away!\nDOCTOR: Not just him! I was able to reprogram the universe in any way I wanted. That includes in here. That includes both of you.\nDECAYED MASTER: (FADING) What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t worry. I’ve been kind. Far kinder than you deserve. I’m returning you to your original times and places. You to Terserus with a restored TARDIS, and you to - well, wherever it is you came from. It all still happened. But you won’t remember a thing about this. So you needn’t be embarrassed next time we chat.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TWO MASTERS by John Dorney (FINAL) Page 136\nDECAYED MASTER: (FADING) No - no! You cannot send me back there!\nNEW MASTER: (FADING) We will meet again Doctor! And I will destroy you!\nDOCTOR: Of course you will!\nDECAYED: MASTER/NEW MASTER: (FADING) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Goodbye!\nDECAYED MASTER: (FADING) This is all your fault, you cretinous ingrate!\nNEW MASTER: (FADING) Mine?
