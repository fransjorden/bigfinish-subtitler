Like — a plantation.\nDOCTOR: Evidence of intent, of planning — of industrialisation, even. All things that shouldn’t happen on Bliss.\nHEX: Why would someone create an ironweed forest?\nDOCTOR: The species is unique: it has mercury for sap.\nHEX: These thorns are amazing.

Sorry, lieutenant, but I can’t allow you inside — parts of the facility are under quarantine.\nBETH: You misunderstand, Professor — asking for permission was a courtesy, nothing more. Roarke Two-Seven-Nine is funded by the military. My troops need treatment, and our ship needs refuelling. You will let us in, or suffer the consequences.\nSHIMURA: Very well.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 14\nDOCTOR: Hex, I want you back inside the TARDIS. You too, Ace.\nACE: No way.\nHEX: You need us.\nDOCTOR: Not this time. Better if neither of you gets involved.\nHEX: You said it yourself, Doctor — something’s terribly wrong\nHEX: here. We can help you put things right.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be so sure about that.\nACE: At least let us try.\nDOCTOR: I need equipment from the TARDIS to analyse these wound patterns. We can debate our next move on the way —\nHEX: Er, what’s that-?\nACE: What’s what?\nHEX: I dunno. Humming.\nDOCTOR: Look up.\nACE: A — cloud?\nDOCTOR: A swarm.\nHEX: Oh great.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 15\nACE: What are they? Hornets?\nDOCTOR: Not in this galaxy, Ace.\nACE: Then [what-?]\nDOCTOR: Piranha locusts.\nHEX: Not a name that inspires confidence.\nACE: Don’t tell me — they’re what happened to those people back there?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nHEX: Look at the size of them-!\nDOCTOR: Four or five times larger than normal. I wonder what’s made these specimens so big?\nACE: Not sure this is the time for scientific curiosity.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense, there’s always time for scientific curiosity.\nHEX: Oh God — they’re coming this way!\nACE: You were saying, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes the need for speed outweighs even my curiosity.\nHEX: In other words-?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 16\nSHIMURA: Forgive my earlier abruptness, Lieutenant. Your sudden arrival took me by surprise.\nBETH: This facility can support forty people when fully staffed. Where are all the others, Professor?\nSHIMURA: Most were evacuated when war spilled into this sector. Then the infection swept through those who stayed behind...\nBETH: Infection?\nSHIMURA: A virus, most likely alien in origin. We put the victims into isolation, sealed off their quarters. A few are still alive. I was fortunate, in that I seem to have some sort of natural immunity.\nBETH: That doesn’t explain why you didn’t join the evacuation.\nSHIMURA: My work is here. I couldn’t abandon a lifetime of research and testing, not when I’m so close to completion.\nBETH: What is this project?\nSHIMURA: Sorry, but you don’t have security clearance for that.\nBETH: Well, once my troops are patched up and our ship’s refuelled, we'll be evacuating you to the nearest military base.\nSHIMURA: (STOPPED) You can’t make me leave.\nBETH: (STOPPED) Professor, listen to me. The Daleks will have control of this sector within days, if not sooner. Either you come with us, or you’ll die here.\nSHIMURA: I’d rather die than leave my work.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 17\nBETH: I’m not threatening you, Professor. Simply stating facts.\nSHIMURA: If Daleks do not frighten me, Lieutenant — what chance have you got? (FX: WALKS AWAY)\nBETH: (CALLING AFTER) Professor.

These are my troops. Who are you?\nSISTERMATIC: Sistermatic, the medical droid. This is my infirmary.\nBETH: I need everyone prepped for evacuation within the hour.\nSISTERMATIC: Impossible. Three of your troopers should not have survived the journey here. Moving them again would certainly be fatal.\nBETH: What about the others?\nSISTERMATIC: Seven I would classify as walking wounded. I was busy treating them when you interrupted me.\nBETH: For a standard medical droid, you’re a real pain in the backside-!\nSISTERMATIC: Displays of anger can be symptomatic of underlying psychological conditions.

There’s a swarm of piranha locusts about to eat us alive out here, and you want I.D.?\nACE: Probably thinks you don’t look eighteen.\nHEX: Oh, ha ha.\nBETH: Hold on.\nACE: You hold on —\nBETH: Piranha locusts?\nKHAN: Security scans show a swarm of insects approaching that location.\nBETH: Can we activate the perimeter security grid?\nKHAN: Not with those three outside.

She hasn’t met us yet.\nHEX: Doctor, how’d you even know this place was here?\nDOCTOR: Lucky guess.\nHEX: Yeah, right.\nACE: Be fair, that fighter was coming in to land —\nDOCTOR: (TO BETH & KHAN) Good afternoon.\nKHAN: Stay where you are!\nHEX: I do love a warm welcome.\nACE: Shame we never get one.\nKHAN: Silence!\nBETH: Who are you people?

Now.\nHEX: You mean those bodies we found outside?\nDOCTOR: They’re just the tip of the iceberg.\nACE: What kind of atrocity?\nDOCTOR: The sort I never wanted either of you to witness. I’m sorry.\nAEX: So we’re here to stop the atrocity, is that it?\nDOCTOR: You couldn’t be further from the truth.\nACE: Stop talking in riddles, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’m not on Bliss to prevent the atrocity. I’m here to make sure it happens!\nHEX: What is this atrocity? What happens here?\nDOCTOR: I can’t tell you that.\nACE: Can’t — or won’t?\nDOCTOR: Very little will ever be made public about what’s happening here on Bliss. I’ve got a role to play in all of this, but you two —\nACE: We were meant to stay in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB)\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nHEX: Page 43\nHEX: We can’t go back now, even if we wanted to — not with those\nHEX: piranha locusts outside.\nACE: And the Daleks on their way.\nDOCTOR: Here they come. Writing history with\nDOCTOR: lightning.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 44\nKHAN: Blasts are getting closer, Lieutenant. Point of origin above\nKHAN: the atmosphere.\nBETH: Daleks like to soften up planets with an orbital bombardment, before their main attack force moves in for the kill.\nKHAN: The facility meteor shield can take one direct hit, maybe two\nKHAN: — but no more than that.\nBETH: Divert all secondary power to the shield.\nBETH: (FX: MEEP, BEEP, BEEP. RISING HUM AS SHIELD REINFORCES ITSELF. )\nKHAN: That’s boosted it by forty-four per cent.\nBETH: (TO HERSELF) Still don’t understand how the Daleks found us... I\nBETH: was certain we’d shaken them off...\nKHAN: Lieutenant?\nBETH: (TO HERSELF) Something else, maybe? Something I missed...?\nKHAN: Lieutenant Stokes!\nBETH: Sorry, I was just.. What is it, Sergeant?\nKHAN: The bombardment’s passed on.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: They’1ll be coming for us soon. No faces, no souls, nothing you can reason with. Just metal.\nKHAN: You’ve fought the Daleks before?\nBETH: Only in battle sims.\nKHAN: Then how-?\nBETH: They attacked the colony where I grew up. Subjugated the people, strip-mined the planet. Tore us apart, like wet paper.\nKHAN: Sorry, Ma’am. I didn’t know.\nBETH: If we’re lucky, the Daleks have orders to exterminate us. A bright light, a few moments of searing pain — and then nothing.\nKHAN: And if we’re unlucky...?\nBETH: They’1ll be taking prisoners, to be interred as potential slave labour.\nKHAN: We'd live to fight another day.\nBETH: Trust me, Khan — that’s not living.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 46\nHEX: Listen — the bombing. It’s stopped.\nACE: Not long until the main Dalek attack.\nHEX: Oh. Still, the Lieutenant’s got a whole army to defend this place, right?\nDOCTOR: How many women in a standard Valkyrie unit, Ace?\nACE: One commissioned officer, and twenty troopers.\nHEX: But we’ve only seen Stokes and her sergeant so far.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nACE: Their escort fighter looked pretty banged up. You don’t get that much damage without sustaining casualties.\nHEX: Where are the others, then?\nDOCTOR: I think we should visit the infirmary. Coming, Ace?\nACE: I’m heading for the command centre, see if I can help there.\nDOCTOR: Stay in touch.\nACE: Copy that.\nDOCTOR: Something puzzling you, Hex?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: No, you’re alright.

The Daleks won’t resume orbital bombardment, not with their patrols closing on us.\nBETH: Alright. Do it.\nKHAN: Switching power from meteor shield to perimeter security grid.\nKHAN: Transfer complete. That should make the Daleks think twice.\nACE: Don’t count on it.\nBETH: What are you doing here?\nACE: Thought I could help.\nKHAN: Experienced Dalek fighter, are you?\nACE: I’ve had my moments.\nBETH: Go back to your friends. War is no place for amateurs.\nACE: Couldn’t agree more. But I was curious about the defence grid.\nKHAN: Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: Looks like the lasers are on their narrowest possible setting, probably as a defence against piranha locusts.\nBETH: So?\nACE: Daleks are much larger than piranha gaps between beams, the lasers will stronger.\nBETH: Very impressive, I’m sure —\nKHAN: Lieutenant, she’s right.

An advanced level medical droid.\nHEX: (KENNETH WILLIAMS) Ooh, Matron —\nSISTERMATIC: My official designation is Sistermatic. Why are you here?\nDOCTOR: We’re on a fact-finding mission to assess how well artificial medics cope in battlefield conditions.\nSISTERMATIC: Roarke Two-Seven-Nine is a research facility, not a war-zone.\nDOCTOR: Not for much longer.\nHEX: Maybe we could see some of your patients?\nSISTERMATIC: If you insist. But they have suffered severe injuries. You may find their condition disturbing.\nDOCTOR: Not to worry, Hex is a trained nurse.\nSISTERMATIC: He is-? (WHIRRING) Very well.\nHEX: (SOTTO) She didn’t take much convincing.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) No, she didn’t. I wonder —\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SISTERMATIC WHIRRS AWAY, FOOTSTEPS AS HEX AND DOCTOR FOLLOW)\nSISTERMATIC: This is Hannah Te Kanawa. She lost both legs in combat.\nHEX: How? Those are burn marks.\nSISTERMATIC: Friendly fire. Another trooper panicked during an enemy attack. The patient is still in shock.\nDOCTOR: What about this poor soul?\nSISTERMATIC: Bowman. Shrapnel embedded in the brain.\nHEX: She doesn’t have long. Oh, man.\nDOCTOR: Casualties of war, Hex.\nSISTERMATIC: Two others have the same prognosis. I have already treated and discharged the remainder of the walking wounded.\nDOCTOR: What about facility staff? I understand you have several under treatment in an isolation unit.\nSISTERMATIC: Unfortunately, their symptoms are beyond my programming.\nHEX: Can we see them?\nSISTERMATIC: Follow me.\nSISTERMATIC: Our first case appeared three weeks ago. The infection swept through facility staff. Just three of these patients remain...\nSISTERMATIC: functioning.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 53\nSISTERMATIC: You can view them through here.\nHEX: My God...\nSISTERMATIC: I warned you this might be disturbing.\nDOCTOR: As if the infection’s eating them alive.\nHEX: Necrotising fasciitis?\nSISTERMATIC: That was my initial diagnosis. But the speed and virulence of the contagion was beyond any recorded cases. These three have lost half their body weight in the past two days.\nHEX: What are you doing to treat them?\nSISTERMATIC: They have been made comfortable.\nHEX: Is that all?\nSISTERMATIC: Their symptoms are being observed.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we could take a closer look?\nSISTERMATIC: That is not possible.\nHEX: This lock’s encrypted.\nDOCTOR: Just like Professor Shimura’s laboratory.\nSISTERMATIC: It was necessary to stop the contagion spreading.\nHEX: You can’t lock them away to die!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 54\nSISTERMATIC: It was necessary to stop the contagion spreading.\nHEX: Is that all you’ve got to say for yourself?\nSISTERMATIC: It was necessary to stop the contagion spreading.\nDOCTOR: Quite right, too.\nHEX: What?! ?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen enough here. Hex, why don’t you stay and help Sistermatic with her patients?\nSISTERMATIC: I do not require assistance.\nDOCTOR: You will. Soon enough.\nHEX: Doctor? Hold ona sec!\nHEX: (FX: MORE FOOTSTEPS AS HEX HURRIES AFTER THE DOCTOR. THEY STOP)\nHEX: (WHISPER) Why’d you agree with Sistermatic? You can’t think--\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) I don’t. Someone’s tampered with her circuits to stop her questioning orders. I need you to get inside that isolation unit, find out what really happened to those patients.\nHEX: (WHISPER) Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Time I met this Professor Shimura. Face to face.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AUTOMATED DOOR SLIDES OPEN. FOOTSTEPS OUT.

Heavier than it looks.\nKHAN: One blast from that punches a hole through anything organic.\nBETH: Shame our enemy’s made of metal.\nACE: The Lieutenant’s right. You’d need a dozen shots to stop one Dalek.\nBETH: You won’t get a dozen shots, Khan. Not even close.\nKHAN: But if we create four-women units, concentrate our fire —\nBETH: It won’t work, Sergeant!\nKHAN: What d’you suggest we do instead?\nACE: You could tweak the pulse frequency to short-circuit the Daleks. Like throwing water under a dodgem.\nKHAN: What’s a dodgem?\nACE: Doesn’t matter. Here, let me show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 56\nBETH: Whatever you’re planning, make it quick.\nACE: Why?\nBETH: That’s the external proximity alert.

Surrender and you will be allowed [free passage from this world -]\nBETH: I said switch it off!\nACE: Weird. Daleks usually exterminate first and interrogate later. Why offer you the chance to surrender?\nBETH: Latest intelligence reports suggest the Daleks have resumed taking prisoners. They must need expendable slave labour.\nKHAN: When the fleet was under attack, you told me the Daleks never took prisoners, lieutenant.\nBETH: I said the Dalek never leave survivors.\nACE: Not unless they can use them.\nKHAN: There were people still alive up there, and you didn’t try to save them!\nBETH: I had to warn others.\nKHAN: By abandoning your post?\nBETH: Stand down, Sergeant.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 59 You don’t deserve to wear that uniform, Stokes. You’re a\nDOCTOR WHO: coward —\nBETH: Stand down!\nBETH: Khan, I want you to go and form the troops into four-women teams. Show them how to modify their pulse emitters. Start with any walking wounded still in the infirmary.\nKHAN: The infirmary? But that’s —\nBETH: Now!\nBETH: You - go with Khan. Make sure she gets it right.\nACE: She looks pretty savvy to me.

I thought I could, thought it would be different this time...\nACE: (ALARMED) You’ve deactivated the laser defence grid!\nBETH: Don’t bother. You’re only prolonging your agony.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 60\nACE: You can’t believe the Daleks will let anyone leave here alive! You’ve seen what they can do!\nBETH: You’ve no idea what I’ve seen. Women and children slaughtered indiscriminately. Whole families murdered en masse.\nACE: So why the Daleks let in here with us?\nBETH: It’s for the best. A quick death, an end to it all...\nACE: Lieutenant, listen to me —\nBETH: Don’t you understand? The Daleks, they don’t give up. They just keep on coming, until... until...\nACE: That’s it.

Just keeping up with the latest developments.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: That does not answer my question.\nDOCTOR: No, it doesn’t. These cocoons, Professor — they’re soft as silk, but spun from metal.\nSHIMURA: Evidently.\nDOCTOR: But what bothers me more is their size.

It was installed to protect facility staff from dangerous native fauna.\nDOCTOR: Ah, the piranha locusts. I encountered a swarm of them earlier.\nSHIMURA: You were fortunate to survive.\nDOCTOR: Especially as the ones I encountered were five times their normal size. Such growth would take a thousand generations of evolution — or the intervention of a scientific genius.\nSHIMURA: You think so?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. But genius alone would not be enough. You’d also need access to gestation chambers, not to mention —\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 71\nSHIMURA: . an Ormston-Idoru accelerator?\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nSHIMURA: Devices prohibited by ethical research laws throughout the galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’ve always believed that rules were made to be broken... so long as those breaking them know what they’re doing.\nSHIMURA: An admirable attitude, Doctor — if not the most conventional.\nDOCTOR: I’m many things, Professor, but conventional isn’t one of them.\nSHIMURA: It’s refreshing to meet someone who shares my attitudes.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it is.\nSHIMURA: Enlarging the piranha locusts was my first experiment when I arrived here. I’ve done so much more since then.\nDOCTOR: The creatures inside these cocoons — they’re the next stage?\nSHIMURA: The final stage. The apotheosis of a lifetime’s work.

Afterwards, it has.. different needs.\nDOCTOR: And different tastes?\nSHIMURA: Precisely. What do you desire, Kiseibyaa?\nKISEIBYAA: Metal. We hunger for metal.\nSHIMURA: It worked. My experiment worked!\nDOCTOR: A creature that feeds on metal?\nDOCTOR: 84\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 85\nSHIMURA: Now you see, Doctor! Now you understand.\nDOCTOR: The pieces are coming together.\nKISEIBYAA: We must feed.\nSHIMURA: You will, Kiseibyaa —\nKISEIBYAA: ‘Kiseibyaa’. Why do you call us that?\nSHIMURA: It means ‘saviour’. I created you to deliver all mankind from a great evil.\nKISEIBYAA: We must feed!!!\nDOCTOR: Well, if it’s metal you want —\nKISEIBYAA: Metal!!!\nDOCTOR: . might I suggest the Professor’s Ormston-Iduro accelerator for starters?\nSHIMURA: No-!!!\nDOCTOR: . and then — this genetic splicing array for a main course?\nSHIMURA: No, you must not —\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t interrupt if I were you, Professor. Looks like the Kiseibyaa hasn’t eaten for some time.\nKISEIBYAA: (FX: IN BETWEEN MOUTHFULS OF METAL) Soon more of our kind will emerge. We have not eaten since our feast of flesh, before the cocooning.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 86\nDOCTOR: ‘Feast of flesh’, Professor?\nSHIMURA: During its larval state, the creature consumes many times its own weight in raw meat.\nDOCTOR: What kind of flesh?\nSHIMURA: My God, look at it. I never imagined the adult stage would be so voracious, so... dominant.\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) What kind of flesh? Animal flesh?\nSHIMURA: Sometimes.\nDOCTOR: Human flesh?\nSHIMURA: I... yes.\nDOCTOR: We found at least a dozen bodies outside, in the ironweed forest. They’d been eaten alive, torn apart.\nSHIMURA: Things got out of hand.\nDOCTOR: There was never any evacuation, was there?\nSHIMURA: No.\nDOCTOR: I thought the piranha locusts were responsible for those corpses.\nSHIMURA: They were. The piranha locusts are the Kiseibyaa’s larval stage.\nDOCTOR: You created this from one of the galaxy’s most voracious species?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 87\nSHIMURA: Yes.\nKISEIBYAA: We hunger! Bring us more metal. Before we breed, we shall sate ourselves on metal!\nDOCTOR: You never know, you might be in luck.\nSHIMURA: Soon, I’1ll bring some soon -\nKISEIBYAA: (ROARING) Now!\nDOCTOR: Don’t keep the Kiseibyaa waiting, Professor.\nSHIMURA: I invented the Kiseibyaa — I can control it!\nDOCTOR: Never had children, have you?\nSHIMURA: Kiseibyaa, listen to me —\nSHIMURA: You're eating my equipment. Those are important scientific\nSHIMURA: instruments, I need them to —\nKISEIBYAA: We hunger.\nSHIMURA: Yes, I know, but —\nKISEIBYAA: We hunger!\nSHIMURA: You’re destroying all my [things —]\nSHIMURA: (FX: ROARING, THE KISEIBYAA LASHES OUT.

I gave you life!\nKISEIBYAA: Your work here is done. Go.\nSHIMURA: Not until you —\nKISEIBYAA: Go!\nDOCTOR: Let’s get out of here, Professor. While we still can.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 89\nACE: Khan, can you hear me? Did you get Hex out of the infirmary?\nHEX: Ace, it’s me.\nACE: You’re alright!\nHEX: Luckier than some.\nACE: I’ve got to get out of here — the Daleks are close to the command centre, they’1ll be inside any minute.\nKHAN: We need to regroup, find somewhere to make a stand.\nACE: What about the kitchens, in the south-east corner? That’s furthest from Dalek incursion and easiest to defend!\nKHAN: Agreed!\nHEX: How long until the Daleks reach that part of the facility?\nACE: Ten, maybe twelve, minutes at their current rate of progress.\nKHAN: Tell the others to fall back to the kitchen. In eight minutes we seal the doors. After that nobody gets in or out.\nACE: I’1ll see you both there!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 90\nDALEK: 1: Report!\nDALEK: 2: The humans are retreating.

I’m not going back.\nDALEK: 1: The Daleks need expendable labour. You will serve us.\nBETH: Kill me now. Save yourselves the trouble of doing it later.\nDALEK: 1: You have no weapon. You are not a threat to the Daleks.\nBETH: Just kill me. Get it over with.\nDALEK: 1: No.\nBETH: Exterminate me! That’s what you always do, isn’t it?\nBETH: I can’t take it anymore. Kill me! Please-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 92\nSHIMURA: I.. I cannot believe the Kiseibyaa attacked me...\nDOCTOR: Later, Professor. What’s this door made of?\nSHIMURA: What-?\nDOCTOR: The door-?\nSHIMURA: Toughened plasteen. A poly-resin compound.\nDOCTOR: Is there any other access to your lab?\nSHIMURA: No, just this door.\nDOCTOR: Then we’ve still got a chance.\nSHIMURA: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Over-riding the entry system. Sealing the Kiseibyaa inside.\nSHIMURA: That won’t stop them for long —\nDOCTOR: No, but long enough for the two of us to review your notes. You have kept notes-?\nSHIMURA: In my private quarters, yes. What are you hoping to find?\nDOCTOR: The Kiseibyaa is a new, completely unknown species. I need to assess what its next move will be.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: Saving humanity — that’s what I created it to do.\nDOCTOR: Your invention couldn’t care less about humanity, Professor. The Kiseibyaa is a predatory animal — sentient, even intelligent — but still an animal. All it wants to do is feed and breed!\nSHIMURA: T-this way. Hurry!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 94\nKHAN: Domingo, fall back! Domingo!\nDALEK: (OFF) Exterminate!\nKHAN: Domingo! Too late —\nHEX: Khan! She’s still moving.

If that’s what you want.\nACE: Lieutenant Stokes?\nBETH: It’s no more than I deserve.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 97\nDOCTOR: How much further, Professor?\nSHIMURA: Not far. It’s just [around —]\nDOCTOR: Get back!\nDOCTOR: Too many Daleks. We need another route.\nSHIMURA: This way.\nDOCTOR: Did you ever wonder how the Daleks came to be, Professor?\nSHIMURA: I’ve heard the stories, the same as everyone else.\nDOCTOR: They were created by a scientist, seeking to break the deadlock in a war. Believing they would save his people.\nSHIMURA: Did he succeed? Did he save them?\nDOCTOR: No. The Daleks exterminated them.\nSHIMURA: And the scientist, what happened to him?\nDOCTOR: His name became a byword for science gone mad. Is that the legacy you would leave, Professor?\nSHIMURA: My Kiseibyaa are nothing like the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Not yet, but they could be — if you don’t try to correct their development. I can help, if you let me.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 98\nSHIMURA: How?\nDOCTOR: Tell me what inspired your creation.\nSHIMURA: Silk worms. My father kept them as a hobby, fed mulberry leaves to the larvae so they’d construct —\nDOCTOR: . cocoons made of silk.\nSHIMURA: As a boy I used to wonder what cocoon they might spin if I fed them something different.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That’s why you grew an ironweed forest.\nSHIMURA: I meant to harvest mercury sap for the Kiseibyaa to drink. But then my funding ran out. The Dalek war, you know?\nDOCTOR: So you sold your talents to the military. Is it just me, or do I hear the sound of history repeating?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 99\nACE: The others’1l be here any minute.\nBETH: If they haven’t been killed. Worse, taken prisoner.\nACE: Real glass-half-empty merchant, aren’t you?\nHEX: Ace?\nACE: Hex! Where are you?\nHEX: Not sure. There’s Daleks everywhere. We’re having to —\nACE: Hex? Hex!\nACE: That does it. I’ve gotta go and help Hex and the others.\nBETH: Don’t leave me!\nBETH: No, you won't. They’1ll kill you, just like — just like they killed my sister. Just like they killed Becca!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 100\nSHIMURA: (ENTERING) In here, Doctor. There is so much I would show you.\nDOCTOR: I warn you, Professor Shimura, I’m not easily impressed.\nSHIMURA: I thought you wanted to see my notes? (FX: DURING THE FOLLOWING, THE DOCTOR IS PRESSING BUTTONS ON A COMPUTER ARRAY — BLEEPS:) To learn how I combined DNA markers from the silk worm and the piranha locust to create a species that could spin gossamer threads of metal, supple as silk yet stronger than any known alloy — (BREAKS OFF) What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Just wondering whether or not to use your intranet to summon the Daleks here, to your quarters.\nSHIMURA: Here-?\nDOCTOR: (FX: A FINAL BLIP) I press this button, the Daleks come running. So to speak.\nSHIMURA: You would not dare —\nDOCTOR: Why so scared, Professor? You summoned the Daleks to Bliss in the first place. Am I right, or am I right?\nSHIMURA: W-when word reached us that the Daleks were attacking refugee fleets in this sector, my fellow scientists were terrified. They couldn’t wait to evacuate this facility. But I saw an opportunity.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nSHIMURA: Have you ever stopped to consider, Doctor, why, exactly, the Daleks have been so successful — as a species, I mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 101\nDOCTOR: Enlighten me.\nSHIMURA: Most predators are themselves prey for another species. But the Daleks are a manufactured predator, without a natural enemy.\nDOCTOR: And so you engineered the Kiseibyaa to prey upon the Daleks.\nSHIMURA: The generals needed a new weapon, something that could reverse the Dalek advances. Something that could stop the war.\nDOCTOR: You created one monster to destroy another.\nSHIMURA: You do understand! I knew you would.\nDOCTOR: I understand that you’re little short of a genius, professor — but you wasted that brilliance on an act of madness. And that madness endangers every life-form in the galaxy.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 102\nKHAN: (PAIN) You can’t carry me all the way, Hex!\nHEX: (EFFORT) Just keep going, yeah?\nKHAN: So tell me — where’d you pick up that martyrdom complex?\nHEX: Ever heard of a place called [Liverpool-? ]\nDALEKS: (OFF) Exterminate!

Surely you must see [that —-]\nDOCTOR: Madness, yes. How else would you describe injecting your own colleagues with Kiseibyaa eggs?\nSHIMURA: I — I don’t understand what you mean —\nDOCTOR: I saw their bodies, Professor.\nSHIMURA: It was — a necessary evil.\nDOCTOR: You turned your fellow scientists into human incubators — and you call it necessary?\nSHIMURA: The Daleks will control this whole sector within days. My colleagues would have died anyway, and for nothing. Their sacrifice was in the service of a greater good.\nDOCTOR: Those lives were not yours to sacrifice!\nSHIMURA: I never wanted my creation to feast on human flesh during its larval stage. Given more time, I could have purged that gene.\nDOCTOR: . but you took a short-cut. And turned one of this galaxy’s most beautiful planets into a factory of death!\nSHIMURA: You’re wrong, Doctor! My intentions were honourable. The Kiseibyaa were created to save mankind!\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. ‘Kiseibyaa.’ The name you gave to your monstrosity.\nSHIMURA: ‘Say-byaa’ is a word like ‘redeemer’ or ‘rescuer’.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: But ‘key-say’ means ‘parasite’ in Japanese, does it not? ‘Kiseibyaa’ — ‘the parasite saviour’!\nSHIMURA: A private joke, a pun — that’s all.\nDOCTOR: I doubt that.

There’s nowhere left to run. Even if it wasn’t my fault the Daleks came here, Khan, Bowman and the others all died because of me.

You can outgrow that.\nKISEIBYAA: We have all but conquered the creatures of metal and flesh. They are our vessels now. (FX: MANACING SCRAPE) You should join us, Doctor. Become one with the Kiseibyaa-!\nDOCTOR: Maybe later. Must dash!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 146\nBLACK DALEK: Doctor...?\nBETH: He’s not here.\nBLACK DALEK: Who are you?\nBETH: Lieutenant Stokes. Beth.\nBLACK DALEK: Your voice is familiar.\nBETH: Your Daleks were attacking a refugee fleet. I begged you to show mercy. Now look at you — helpless, defenceless. Pathetic.\nBLACK DALEK: Take your revenge. Kill me.\nBLACK DALEK: Do it. Do it!\nBETH: No.\nBLACK DALEK: You refuse?\nBETH: I spent years in Dalek labour camps. Watching everyone around me die. Fighting other prisoners for scraps of food. Betraying what I believed in just to stay alive. Everything I’ve done, all the things I’ve been since then — it’s... (BEAT) You made me like this.\nBLACK DALEK: Then exterminate me. Exterminate me!\nBETH: I= od...\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 147\nDOCTOR: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Don’t torture yourself, Lieutenant Stokes.\nACE: Yeah. He’s not worth it.\nBETH: Ace, Hex. You shouldn’t be here —\nBLACK DALEK: The parasites are moving inside me. Soon they will hatch.\nDOCTOR: Then we haven’t much time. How do I access your power cells?\nBLACK DOCTOR: Remove the panel below me.\nDOCTOR: Ahh, I see them.\nBETH: What are you doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Something I’d hoped to avoid.\nHEX: Beth? You alright?\nBETH: I’m not sure.\nDOCTOR: All of you. Help me move the Black Dalek nearer to that power relay.\nACE: Why we doing this?\nDOCTOR: Long or short version?\nHEX: Short. Sooner we get out of here, happier I’11 be.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 148\nACE: Well?\nBLACK DALEK: The Doctor is helping me... self-destruct.\nDOCTOR: I’m triggering a power overload that’1ll destroy this facility.\nACE: Destroying the Kiseibyaa at the same time?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nBETH: You’re going to wipe out a species that can defeat the Daleks?\nHEX: But that’s —\nACE: . genocide.\nHEX: Big word. Big, big word.\nACE: Doctor. You said one of the worst atrocities of the Daleks wars would be committed here — this is it, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nACE: But the Kiseibyaa could end the Dalek wars forever. Think how many millions of lives that'd save.\nHEX: Only like America dropping the bomb on Japan. It ended the war alright, but the cost —\nBLACK DALEK: These creatures are more dangerous than any bomb.\nACE: Yeah, you would say that, wouldn’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: Ace, Hex — try to understand. What’s about to happen will\nDOCTOR WHO: happen. Has happened. Must happen. I’ve been searching for my\nDOCTOR WHO: part in these events ever since we landed here.\nBETH: I don’t understand. Why d’you keep talking as if all of this is already history? Who are you people?\nACE: Don’t ask.\nHEX: Even if we explained it, you wouldn’t believe us.\nBETH: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We travel in time and space.\nACE: Righting wrongs.\nHEX: Protecting eternity.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes I have foreknowledge of events.\nACE: And sometimes we’re part of events.\nHEX: Part of history, you might say.\nBETH: What about this time, this place?\nDOCTOR: If I don’t make certain history unfolds correctly, the Kiseibyaa will bring a terror to the galaxy that makes the Daleks pale in comparison. They must be stopped. Here. Now.\nBETH: How can you be so certain?\nDOCTOR: I’ve seen what happens if the wrong choices are made. I was present when the Daleks were born, long ago. I had a chance avert their creation.\nDOCTOR: to\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 150\nHEX: So why didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: At the time I feared wiping out an entire intelligent life form would make me no better than the creatures I’d been sent to destroy. I comforted myself with the knowledge that something good must come out of the Daleks’ evil.\nBETH: You don’t believe that anymore?\nDOCTOR: What science and fear of the Daleks have wrought here is as evil and twisted as the Daleks themselves. Do I have the right to destroy the Kiseibyaa? Probably not.\nACE: Then why do it?\nDOCTOR: It’s my duty, my place in history. Sometimes, that’s all we have.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 151\nKISEIBYAA: Let us sing our creator’s lullaby as we go to witness the next generation of Kiseibyaa being born in the flesh of our enemy...\nMULTIPLE KISEIBYAA: Sakura, sakura,\nMULTIPLE KISEIBYAA: no-yama mo sato mo, mi-watasu kagiri.. [ETC]\nDALEK: 1: Report!\nDALEK: 2: The enemy have exterminated all other Daleks. We are the last.\nDALEK: 1: I have ordered our vessel in orbit to leave. We cannot become carriers for the Kiseibyaa.\nDALEK: 2: Then... we must destroy each other!\nDALEK: 1: Yes. In three rels.\nDALEKS: (TOGETHER) Three. Two. One. Exterminate-!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 152\nDOCTOR: There. All I need do now is trigger the overload.\nBETH: Let me do it, Doctor.\nACE: Beth?\nHEX: Are you sure?\nBETH: Yes. After everything that’s happened, all I know is: to destroy a monster, first you have to become a monster.\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily.\nBETH: Please. Let me be the one to trigger the overload.\nDOCTOR: Very well. Touch those two wires together.\nBLACK DALEK: It is... time?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Your circuits are overloading. The countdown’s begun.\nHEX: I can’t see any countdown.\nACE: Don’t look, Hex — listen.\nDOCTOR: The closer the beeps are together, the nearer detonation is.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 153\nDOCTOR WHO: How long?\nDOCTOR: A few minutes.\nACE: Enough time to get clear of this place, I hope. (FX: RUNNING) Come on, Hex!\nHEX: You don’t have to tell me! (FX: EXITS)\nDOCTOR: Beth, go with them.\nBETH: Part of me — it wants to watch. The part the Daleks made.\nDOCTOR: Beth!\nBETH: Yes. Yes, I know —\nBLACK DALEK: Doctor. The ruthlessness you have demonstrated here is — impressive.\nDOCTOR: Spare us the pleasantries. We’re leaving.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE KISEIBYAA LULLABY BECOMES AUDIBLE AS THE MASS OF\nMONSTERS: APPROACH THE LABORATORY )\nBLACK DALEK: You will share my fate, Doctor. Listen!\nBLACK DALEK: The Kiseibyaa. They are coming.\nDOCTOR: Beth, go after Ace and Hex. I’1l make sure the Kiseibyaa don’t interfere with the countdown.\nBETH: (LAUGHS) What are you planning to stop them with?\nDOCTOR: I can be most persuasive when required.\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 154\nBETH: I’m the soldier here, not you. Get out, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to die, Beth!\nBETH: No. But the truth is, Doctor, I don’t much want to live.\nBETH: (FX: MASSIVE METALLIC ROAR FROM THE KISEIBYAA OVERWHELMS HER\nWORDS: FOR A MOMENT. ONCE IT RECEDES--)\nBETH: Just go, will you?!? For Ace and Hex. And because —\nBLACK DALEK: Because-?!?\nBETH: Because I don’t want to give him the satisfaction.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Beth.\nBETH: Go!\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 155\nACE: Where is he?\nHEX: Should have been here by now.\nACE: Doctor? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: What are you waiting for?\nHEX: Where’s Beth?\nDOCTOR: Run!\nACE: But —\nDOCTOR: Don’t argue — run!\nBLACK DALEK: The Kiseibyaa. They are — heeeeere...!\nKISEIBYAA: Sakura, sakura,\nKISEIBYAA: no-yama mo sato mo,\nKISEIBYAA: mi-watasu kagiri..\nBETH: Oh God. Oh God. Becca —\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 156\nDOCTOR: (LOW AND QUIET) It’s over...\nDOCTOR: Into the TARDIS, both of you. Time we were away from here.\nHEX: Do you think — do you think she was right?\nACE: Who? Beth?\nHEX: Yeah. You know, about how we only defeat monsters by becoming monsters ourselves?\nACE: Aww, mate. Beth — she had no-one to save her, from who she became. But we look after each other, right? (FX: SLAPS HEX’S BACK)\nHEX: Oww-!\nACE: Come on, you two. I’m not planning on sticking around here for a moment longer. ‘Bliss’. As if-!\nHEX: What do you think? Doctor-?\nDOCTOR: Do we have to become a monster to defeat a monster? As I told Beth... Not necessarily.\nHEX: Back there, in the infirmary — I couldn’t help. All those years of training, all my experience — there was nothing I could do. Not for anyone.\nDOCTOR: Hex. I’m sure you did all you could —\nDOCTOR WHO: ENEMY OF THE DALEKS by David Bishop (003 - AB) Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: I’m thinking — is this me, Doctor? Ace, she was born to all this. It’s like she was made for it. But me — I’m a nurse. A pretty good one, too —\nDOCTOR: You think your talents are wasted here?\nHEX: Not exactly. It’s just — am I right for all this? Am I right for.. this life we live?\nDOCTOR: Only you can know that for certain, Hex.\nHEX: I guess. (BEAT) Hark at me, bleating on. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Come on. It’s been a long day.\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR: 231163-15"
