The fact that he has been so cruelly and violently taken from us only bears testament to his courage and honesty — qualities sadly lacking in the late President Harmon of Garrack, who brought about the destruction of his entire city and its population.\nVALLAN: My people, this is the dawn of a new era. We must not be fearful; but neither must we be too willing to place trust in outsiders who seek to destroy our way of life. With the city of Garrack gone, we in Stronghaven must look to ourselves for the strength we require. And although it is true that we once thought we needed Garrak — that we once viewed it as our twin city — we now know in our hearts that all we really need to survive is ourselves... Our city...

(FX: SURPRISED MURMUR FROM CROWD) President Karnex’s decision was not taken lightly, and I know it has had a real impact on our society. However, the moment that President Harmon of Garrak was revealed as a dangerous cult leader — and given what we now know about the explosion, there can be no doubt about this — once, as I Say, we knew their President was unstable, it became apparent that any Garrak-living, or even Garrak-born, citizen is a potential threat to Stronghaven security.\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 6\nVALLAN: SCENE 6: EXT.

I firmly believe that in the long-term it will become clear to all that the Garrak Exclusion Bill has ensured Stronghaven’s safe future. And I would remind you that the very opinion polls that you members of the press so often quote at us, clearly indicate that the vast majority of Stronghaven citizens agree. Move the microphone to that one, please. Yes?\nVALLAN: JOURNO # 2:\nVALLAN: (MIC DISTORTION) Here at The Daily Bulletin, we exclusively understand that President Karnex’s assassin — Nia Brusk — has escaped. Is that correct?\nVALLAN: (MIC DISTORTION) Er... As you know, I am determined to maintain the openness and honesty which marked President Karnex’s term in office. Therefore... I can only confirm this news. (FX: MORE CROWD ALARM, OUTRAGE) But I assure you, our new Hover-Sentries are scanning the whole 10-mile stretch between here and the Garrak ruins. Rest assured that Brusk and her fellow escapee Sherla Randall will be back in custody very soon.\nVALLAN: JOURNO # 2: (MIC DISTORTION) But how exactly did Brusk manage to escape?\nMEERA: (MIC DISTORTION) Thank you, members of the press. Regrettably we need to cut this Q&A short. I do apologize.\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 9\nMEERA: (MIC DISTORTION) I’m sorry, but we will schedule another one soon.

FOREST (PATH)\nMARY: I thought you said we’d arrive in time for luncheon? Looks like we’ve missed it by several hours.\nDOCTOR: The planet’s in perpetual twilight. It’s either eerie or beautiful, depending on your point of view.\nMARY: I choose the latter.\nDOCTOR: A Romantic through and through! The stars are astonishing, aren’t they? Shall we stroll beneath them, Mary? Would you take my arm?\nMARY: (SLIGHTLY FLUSTERED) I... er, no, I’m quite content as I am. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: (CHEERY, OBLIVIOUS) As you wish. Now, if my calculations and co-ordinates serve me well, the people we’1l encounter here are tenth generation settlers from Earth... all very peaceful and happy. And this is the continent of Zelonia, the most serene country on the planet.\nMARY: ‘Serene’, you say? Hmmm. I remember you using that word about the planet Mayhem. You were at pains to predict how amusingly ironic I would find the name Mayhem once I had visited the place. Sadly, there was a noticeable absence of irony.\nDOCTOR: Which is, in itself, kind of ironic, don’t you think? I still have one strand of duckwolf-weed stuck between my toes — can’t get it out for love nor money. But trust me, Zelonia’s a totally different kettle of fish. See that glass dome in the far distance, at the base of the cliffs? That’s the city of Stronghaven. As the name suggests, it’s a place of stability, tranquility and safety. Let’s head for that. I’m sure they’1l stump up a five-star luncheon!\nDOCTOR: 10\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 11\nDOCTOR: SCENE 9: INT.

There’s surely no need to lock the office door as well?\nMEERA: Better safe than sorry.\nVALLAN: Look: what is going on?\nMEERA: Listen to this. Private Baden’s emergency call to Commander Raynar, 15 minutes ago.\nMEERA: (FX: ACTIVATES HER WRIST COMMUNICATOR. RECORDING BEGINS WITH A BEEP. )\nPRIVATE BADEN: (DISTORT, RUNNING) This is Private Baden. Red alert — the Senate Building is under attack. Captain Maddox is down!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) Raynar here. Under attack? Be more specific, private.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Who is attacking us?\nPRIVATE BADEN: (DISTORT) The dead, Sir. The dead are coming!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) I didn’t catch that, Baden. Repeat.\nPRIVATE BADEN: (DISTORT) The walking dead, Sir. Skeletons. Bare bones, that’s all they are.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) Have you lost your senses, Private?\nPRIVATE BADEN: (DISTORT) They’re here! They’re inside the Senate!\nPRIVATE BADEN: Get away from me! No! Nooo! Aaaarrghhhhh!\nPRIVATE BADEN: 11\nPRIVATE BADEN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 12\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) Baden? Come in! Baden!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FX: CLICK-CLACKS, CLOSE UP SKELETON GROWL DISTORTING, COMMUNICATOR DIES. RECORDING ENDS WITH A ‘BEEP’ )\nMEERA: Now perhaps you’1ll understand my precautions.\nVALLAN: It’s unbelievable. (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Come in, Commander Raynar. Report, please.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) Raynar here, Mr President. The press have been evacuated without incident and we now have the situation in hand. All intruders have been... disabled.\nVALLAN: “Disabled”?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) I’m reluctant to say “killed”, Sir. Given, you know, the nature of the enemy.\nMEERA: But you have stopped them, haven’t you, Commander?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (DISTORT) Might I suggest you both come over and see for yourselves? We’re in the North Wing, Corridor C, near the Great Hall.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 12\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 13\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: SCENE 10: EXT. FOREST (PATH)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FX: TWO SETS OF FOOTSTEPS STROLL ALONG PATH, WIND BLOWS TREES. FOOTSTEPS STOP. )\nMARY: Don’t tell me: you’re lost.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t bargain on the forest roof becoming quite this dense. I’ll be okay just as soon as I find the moon again. Ah, look — a clearing ahead of us. Come on.\nMARY: (LOW) Wait! (THEY STOP) Look: on the far side. There’s someone\nMARY: sleeping on the ground.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Then we must be careful not to wake them. Perhaps if we—\nNIA: (COLD, LOW) Both of you, put your hands in the air and slowly - very slowly — turn around to face me.\nDOCTOR: Hello. My! You’re very tall, aren’t you? I wonder if you’d\nDOCTOR: mind lowering the crossbow. You have nothing to fear from us.\nNIA: The same can’t be said for me. One false move and it’1l be your last. (LOUD) Sherla, wake up. Company.\nMARY: (SOTTO) It’s Mayhem all over again.\nNIA: (LOUDER) Sherla!\nSHERLA: (OFF) Nia? What’s going on?\nSHERLA: 13\nSHERLA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 14\nNIA: Visitors.\nSHERLA: (OFF) What kind?\nNIA: Unwelcome. It’s okay, I’1l deal with them. You pack and get ready to move. (TO MARY & THE DOCTOR) Now then, you two. I have a very important question for you. Think carefully before you answer, because there’s a lot riding on what you say. Why shouldn’t I slaughter you like a couple of quayla-beast?\nDOCTOR: Funnily enough, that’s not as question I get asked that frequently.\nDOCTOR: 14\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 15\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11: INT. SENATE BUILDING (CORRIDOR)\nVALLAN: “Bare bones”, just as Baden said. A trail of bones...\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: That’s why I wanted you to see it for yourself, Lord President. That and what’s about to happen.\nMEERA: What’s about to [happen]-\nMEERA: (FX: LOW RASP OF BONES SHUFFLE ACROSS THE FLOOR IN GRADUAL BURSTS, CONTINUOUS )\nMEERA: Oh. I see.\nVALLAN: They move? The bones move?!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Yes, Sir. They don’t give up. Like the skeletons before them, they keep heading in the same direction. Single file — like ants.\nMEERA: How long is this trail, Commander?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: It leads all the way in from the North entrance, Lady Meera. As far as we can tell, that’s where the skeletons made their first appearance — out of the forest.\nVALLAN: Have you been using flamer-throwers on them?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: No, Sir. They were scorched like that already. We merely blew them apart.\nMEERA: Immune to bullets, immune to fire. How do you stop a thing like that?\nCOMMANDER RAYNER: Like this. (CRRRR-UNCH! A BOOT REDUCES BONES TO DUST) I’m sorry Lady Meera, it’s not pretty but it works. They only stop moving when practically reduced to dust.\nCOMMANDER RAYNER: 15\nCOMMANDER RAYNER: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 16\nCOMMANDER RAYNER: (FX: BONES SLIDE ACROSS THE FLOOR IN SLOW BURSTS, AND CONTINUE TO DO SO)\nVALLAN: How did they get so close to the Senate without being detected? Where were the Hover-Sentries?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Both off searching for the prisoners, Sir.\nMEERA: But if they were scanning the forests, why didn’t they detect an impending attack on the Senate?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: I don’t know, ma’am. Would you like me to bring the Sentries in for a diagnostic?\nMEERA: No: we have to find Nia Brusk before we drown in a tidal wave of bad press.\nVALLAN: All this hammers home just how unprepared we are. We need to toughen up, Commander, so rally more recruits. And destroy the rest of these bones.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Yes, Lord President. Guards! Get stomping!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FX: THE REPEATED STOMPING OF BOOTS ON BONE, REDUCING THEM TO DUST...)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 16\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 17\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: SCENE 12: EXT. FOREST (TREES)\nNIA: For the last time: where you are from?\nMARY: We’ve told you: we’re travellers.\nDOCTOR: Strangers in a strange land. By the way, I didn’t think weapons had been needed in Zelonia for centuries. (THE THOUGHT OCCURS TO HIM) I say, you two aren’t criminals, are you?\nNIA: Only in Stronghaven’s eyes. We met in prison.\nMARY: Prison? What had you done?\nSHERLA: (APPROACHING) Don’t listen to her, Nia. She knows full well who you are. Come on, best get moving before the Hover- Sentries pick up our trail.\nMARY: Hover-Sentries, what are they?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of flying robot, I expect. People always come up with such dull names for these things. I’d go for something snappier. Flybots! Yes, that sounds good. ‘Dispatch the flybots to bring back their bodies.’\nNIA: You really aren’t from round here, are you? I think you’d better come with us to Garrak.\nMARY: And who, pray, is Garrak?\nDOCTOR: Garrak is Zelonia’s other major city. Rather a flashy affair, if memory serves: all fountains and Tiffany glass.\nNIA: Not any more. Three weeks ago, Garrak and everyone in it, was destroyed by a bomb.\nNIA: 17\nNIA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 18\nMARY: The entire city? But that’s terrible. How did it happen?\nNIA: President Harmon turned out to be an insane fanatic. He was determined to take everyone in Garrak to what he called “the grand utopia”.\nSHERLA: Most people went along with it, whether voluntarily or not. Come on, let’s get moving.\nSHERLA: (FX: THEY HEAD OFF, FEET SCRUNCHING LIGHTLY ON THE FOREST FLOOR)\nDOCTOR: So why weren’t you in Garrak when it happened?\nNIA: Sherla and I were born there, but we’ve lived in Stronghaven for most of our lives. When Garrak went up, it was feared that Harmon’s death cult could infect Stronghaven too.\nSHERLA: Everyone born in Garrak became ‘the enemy within’.\nNIA: Especially me. Got myself branded an insurgent, just for publicly disagreeing with Stronghaven’s policies. I’ve been in and out of prison ever since.\nMARY: So how many died in the Garrak explosion?\nSHERLA: Thousands upon thousands. Many haven’t officially been named alive or dead.\nNIA: Including my husband, Skylon. He commuted to Garrak every day to work for Harmon’s Ministry. He was there on the... he was there when it happened, I think. I can’t be sure because I’ve been locked up ever since and I’ve had no opportunity to search for him.\nMARY: I’m so sorry.\nDOCTOR: If there’s any way we can help...\nDOCTOR: 18\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 19\nSHERLA: There is. You’ll make useful hostages, if we get cornered.\nDOCTOR: Not entirely what I had in mind. By the way, Nia, you said you’d been in and out of prison. If they keep letting you out, why did you bother escaping this time?\nNIA: Ssssh! Keep down!\nNIA: HOVER-SENTRIES: (DISTANT) Scanning Forest Sector 12C.\nMARY: (HUSHED) Flybots?\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) Spot on.\nNIA: (HUSHED) No more talking. Move on and be ready to run at my command.\nNIA: 19\nNIA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 20\nNIA: SCENE 13: INT. STRONGHAVEN SENATE BUILDING (VALLAN’S CHAMBER)\nMEERA: Lord President, Commander Raynar informs me that all the bones have been disposed of. I think we should cancel your next Press Conference. Actually, perhaps the next two. It gives us more options.\nVALLAN: (MUSING AS HE STARES OUT OF THE WINDOW) Do you think the people of Stronghaven have faith in me?\nMEERA: Of course they do, Sir.\nVALLAN: There’s really no need to call me ‘Sir’ when it’s just you and me, Meera.\nMEERA: (SOTTO) The guard outside might hear... John.\nVALLAN: I haven’t slept since the president died, you know. I used to sleep a lot, in the old days — when I thought I’d be Vice President for years.\nMEERA: This Senate Building is exactly where you deserve to be, John. You’1ll be a great leader.\nVALLAN: Will I? It’s easy to lead during peacetime, Meera. But Garrak, Karnex and now this insane invasion...\nMEERA: You can do this. President Vallan will go down in history as the man who saved Stronghaven.\nVALLAN: Do you think they’11 find out? About you, I mean.\nMEERA: I.. I don’t think so. No one knows but us. The only people who can alter the birthing records are the President and the Vice President — and you’re both of them. As far as Stronghaven’s concerned, I was born and raised here.\nMEERA: 20\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 21\nVALLAN: Let’s hope it stays that way. If anyone ever discovered that I’d made an exception for you, I'd be torn from office and you’d be detained and expelled just like all the other Garrak- born.\nMEERA: No one knows. I moved here pre-school. Now sleep!\nVALLAN: How am I supposed to do that?\nMEERA: You can at least try. No one should make decisions without rest. I’1l wake you in five hours.\nVALLAN: Make it three. And wake me immediately if anything else\nVALLAN: happens.\nMEERA: Very well. (SOTTO) Dream of me.\nVALLAN: (TO COMPUTER) Dim lights.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Ambient luminescence decreasing.\nVALLAN: (TO COMPUTER) Music.

VERY QUIETLY) Guards... guards...\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION] : You want to run to the door, but your limbs betray you. That must be most upsetting.\nVALLAN: (WEAKLY) Who are you? Are you here to kill me?\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION] : Don’t you recognize my voice? I’m Harmon. Valek Harmon.\nVALLAN: 23\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 24\nVALLAN: (WEAKLY) Harmon? That’s impossible. You died in your own explosion... died along with all the Garraks you betrayed.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: The report of my death was... not.. an exaggeration. I did die. And yet here I am.\nVALLAN: (SHIVERS, UNNERVED) That’s impossible.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: No less impossible surely than living skeletons attacking Stronghaven.\nVALLAN: Those skeletons came from you?!\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]:\nVALLAN: They are my warriors. You stopped them, Vallan. An unwise and pointless thing to do. You cannot stop death. Death is relentless. Death never gives up until it gets what it wants.\nVALLAN: And what is that you want, Harmon?\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION] : Lower the city’s defences. Reduce security to a mere token gesture.\nVALLAN: And if I don’t?\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: I will return.

It is not my mind. It is my heart. Buried in my heart is a shameful truth, which I am finding it difficult to face. And yet, face it I must, no matter what the consequence.\nNIA: What are you doing?\nMARY: (SLAMMING THE JOURNAL SHUT) Passing the time, nothing more.\nNIA: Show me what you’ve written.\nMARY: Nia, you have us as hostages. And there I must draw the line.\nNIA: Do not test me.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP) Nia, if Sherla has quite finished climbing trees, I suggest we move on. The flybots can’t be far behind us.\nNIA: (CALLING UP) Sherla? Any sign of the Sentries?\nSHERLA: They’re meticulous hunters and that is their weakness. (SHE REACHES THE GROUND) Too slow.\nMARY: How far is it to Garrak?\nNIA: Two hours.\nDOCTOR: In that case, Nia, we’ll come with you and do our best to help.\nDOCTOR: 25\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 26\nNIA: You have no choice, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know. Just seemed nicer the way I put it, don’t you think?\nNIA: All niceties are obsolete in this world. Onwards!\nMARY: (SOTTO) What are we to make of all this, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Two things, Mary. Firstly, the fact that I’ve clearly brought us to the worst possible moment of Zelonia’s history. Secondly, the fact that irony appears to follow me round the\nDOCTOR: universe.\nMARY: Do you have any deeper analysis to hand?\nDOCTOR: We have to try and make Nia see us as something more than merely bargaining chips or human shields.\nMARY: (WORRIED) Do you think they are desperate enough to kill us?\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope not. I’m sorry, Mary — this must be one of those moments where you wish you were back with Percy.\nMARY: (STOPS ABRUPTLY) Please don’t let us talk of Percy!\nDOCTOR: (ALSO STOPPED) I’m sorry. Have I upset you in some way?\nMARY: You haven’t the faintest notion, have you?\nDOCTOR: Of what?\nMARY: I try to think of Percy. I really do. But each time it is you, Doctor, you who are in my thoughts. And my heart.\nMARY: 26\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 27\nDOCTOR: Well I... that is.. I mean...

Of course you may have painted some lovely murals, for all I know. Only it’s kind of hard to tell, what with this hood on my head.\nRAYNAR: Remove the hood.\nRAYNAR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: (HOVERING DOWN & DOING SO) Removing hood.\nDOCTOR: Ah! That’s better. A friendly face.\nRAYNAR: You have precisely one minute to tell me who you are, what you were doing in the forest with the fugitive Nia Bruck and everything you know about the walking skeletons.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps ‘friendly’ was a tad premature.\nRAYNAR: If I deem your responses to be less than satisfactory, I shall have the Sentry here remove your arm.\nDOCTOR: What was the first question again?\nDOCTOR: 33\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 34\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: INT.

I could [always]-\nVALLAN: Get on with it woman! I’m sorry, Meera. I’m fine. Just... stressed. Please, continue with your report.\nMEERA: (HURT, BUT TRYING TO HIDE IT) The Sentries found four people in the forest: Brusk, Randall and two others. Randall was killed, Brusk and an unidentified female escaped and the fourth’s in custody.\nVALLAN: What do we know about this fourth man, aside from the fact that he’s an accomplice of Brusk and Randall? Who is he?\nMEERA: No one knows. He matches no profile on record.\nVALLAN: That’s ridiculous! Everyone on this planet is recorded in the central register\nMEERA: Well, we’ll find out who he is soon enough. Commander Raynar’s interrogating him as we speak. I’1l call the lift and we can go down to see for ourselves. (SUMMONS LIFT) Incidentally, I’ve upped security around the city, as instructed.\nVALLAN: Upped security? (OH GOD)\nMEERA: That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?\nVALLAN: Yes. Yes, of course.\nMEERA: (LIFT ARRIVES; DOORS OPEN) Here we are.\nMEERA: 34\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 35\nMEERA: SCENE 22: INT.

I’m\nVALLON: coming to speak to the prisoner myself.\nRAYNAR: Understood. Sentries: stand down.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I’m rather attached to that arm.\nDOCTOR: Who gave that order, by the way?\nDOCTOR: RAYNAR?: President Vallan.\nDOCTOR: I like him already.\nMEERA: I am Meera Darone, the Presidential Aide. And this is -\nDOCTOR: President Vallon! I’ve heard so much about you. I couldn’t help reflecting, as I was flown upside down towards your beautiful city, how politeness and hospitality seem to be in short supply in Stronghaven these days.\nVALLON: These are troubled times. Sometimes extreme measures are necessary.\nVALLON: 35\nVALLON: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 36\nDOCTOR: The tyrants eternal whine.\nMEERA: How dare you speak to the President in that tone?\nVALLON: It’s all right, Meera. I can defend my own honour. What’s your name, prisoner?\nDOCTOR: Well, since you’re asking nicely and not threatening to remove one of my appendages, I’1l tell you. I’m the Doctor. I arrived here today — at least I think it was today, it’s impossible to tell in all this half-light. Anyway my friend Mary and I were taking a perambulation through the forest when we fell in with the wrong crowd.\nVALLAN: I take it you are referring to Nia Brusk?\nDOCTOR: And Sherla, yes. They took Mary and me hostage.\nMEERA: By what means did you enter Zelonia?\nDOCTOR: You know, I’m giving serious consideration to drawing up a leaflet of Frequently Asked Questions, then simply handing it over whenever I’m arrested. It would save an awful lot of time. I arrived here in my time and space machine, the TARDIS.\nMEERA: I warn you not to be facetious. We can easily set the Hover- Sentries back on you.\nVALLAN: That’ll do, Meera. Commander, I wonder if you’d be so good as to leave us alone for a moment.\nRAYNAR: But, sir, the prisoner -\nVALLAN: (SNAPPING) He’s strapped to a chair! What harm can he do? (CALMING) Besides, I have the Hover-Sentries to protect me.\nRAYNAR: As you wish, sir.\nRAYNAR: 36\nRAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 37\nVALLAN: You too, Meera.\nMEERA: But -\nVALLAN: That’s an order!\nMEERA: Very well. Come with me, Commander. We can review the new security arrangements for the Senate.\nRAYNAR: Ma’am.\nDOCTOR: To what do I owe this private téte-a-téte?\nVALLAN: Did Brusk tell you why she was imprisoned?\nDOCTOR: Because she’s from the city of Garrak.\nVALLAN: I’m afraid she misled you about the true nature of her crime.\nDOCTOR: Don’t tell me: she forgot to pay her council tax?\nVALLAN: No. She assassinated President Karnex. She’s a cold-blooded\nVALLAN: killer, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But Mary’s with her.\nDOCTOR: 37\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 38\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23: EXT. FOREST (PATH)\nNIA: Can’t you move any faster? This is like dragging a piece of driftwood.\nMARY: (RATTLED) I am moving as fast as I possibly can. These shoes are hardly appropriate for hiking. Besides, I was thinking about the Doctor.\nNIA: Don’t worry. You’1ll see your husband alive again.\nMARY: Husband?\nNIA: But the odds are against me seeing mine.\nMARY: I get the impression that you always feel the odds are against you. Quite the persecution complex you’ve got there.\nNIA: I told you before not to test me, Mary — and I meant it. Don’t make me put a bolt through your skull.\nMARY: No.\nNIA: No? What do you mean ‘no’?\nMARY: For all your talk, I don’t believe you have a killer’s eyes.\nNIA: (THROWN) Well, you’re the only person in this entire land to-\nMARY: (SUDDEN WHISPER) Shh! Listen: those skeletons are returning.\nNIA: (WHISPER) Quick. Under here. (HIDING IN A BUSH) We must be completely silent. You saw what they did to Sherla.\nNIA: (FX: SMALL ARMY OF SKELETONS, APPROACHES. THEY’RE RIGHT UP TO US NOW.. AND THEN THEY HALT, VIRTUALLY AS ONE.

Nia had an anger about her, it’s true, and a certain anti-authoritarian streak, but assassination? No. Mind you, she was certainly frightened and frightened people do stupid things.\nVALLAN: Frightened?\nDOCTOR: There was a haunted look in her eyes, as if she’d seen a ghost. That same look is in your eyes now, Mr President.\nVALLAN: This interview isn’t about me.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it? How many interviews with prisoners does the President of Stronghaven normally conduct alone?\nVALLAN: (DEFENSIVE) What do you mean by that?\nDOCTOR: There’s something wrong, isn’t there, Mr President? I mean, something really wrong. Tell me about Harmon.\nVALLAN: (STARTLED) H-harmon?\nDOCTOR: Assuming Nia was telling the truth about Garrak, why do you think President Harmon destroyed his own city?\nVALLAN: They say he came to consider himself God-like. His cult grew within society, like an infection, until it engulfed Garrak. And why the hell am I answering your questions? For all I know, you could be one of Harmon’s people.\nDOCTOR: That’s the problem, you see.. After a traumatic event like Garrak’s destruction, fear settles like a frost. Paranoia bites hard. And who do you trust? Your President Karnex seems to have taken that paranoia to extremes. Surely ejecting or detaining Garrak-born citizens was taking it too far?\nDOCTOR: 39\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 40\nVALLAN: I don’t believe so.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t know so. What if, for instance, Miss Darone had been from Garrak? Would you have backed Karnex’s measures then?\nVALLAN: What are you saying?\nDOCTOR: Look, all I want to do is help restore the status quo, solve the riddle of the skeletons, find Mary and be on my way. So: let’s talk bare bones.\nDOCTOR: 40\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 41\nDOCTOR: SCENE 25: EXT. FOREST (PATH)\nDOCTOR: (FX: SKELETONS, MARCHING ONWARDS. CLICK, CLACK, CLICK, CLACK... MARY & NIA RECOVER AS THE MARCHING FADES AWAY. )\nMARY: (WHISPER) There are hundreds of them. Where are they heading?\nNIA: (WHISPER) Looks like Stronghaven. At least they’re out of our way. Come on, that’s the last of them. Let’s go.\nMARY: Nia.\nNIA: What?\nMARY: You described the Doctor as my “husband”. Just so you know: that isn’t the case.\nNIA: I see.\nMARY: We're just... friends. Travelling companions. That is all. I'd hate you to get the wrong impression.\nNIA: I haven’t.\nMARY: What I’m saying, in a roundabout way, is that I’d like to help you find Skylon. Oh, I know you could make me do it, but I’d like to help willingly. It’s not good to be separated from your loved ones. And perhaps, once we find your husband, you can help me find the Doctor?\nNIA: You're pretty tough, for a stranger in a strange land. All right, Mary. You’ve got a deal.\nNIA: 41\nNIA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 42\nNIA: SCENE 26: INT. SENATE BUILDING (INTERROGATION ROOM)\nVALLAN: A group of warriors — skeletons, I mean — broke into this Senate Building earlier today. They killed several of my guards. What mystifies me is why the Hover-Sentries didn’t see them approaching the complex.\nDOCTOR: What kind of detection system do they use?\nVALLAN: Thermal imagi-. (REALISING) Ah.\nDOCTOR: Not much heat to emit when you’re literally a bag of bones.\nVALLAN: What are these things, Doctor? How do they move?\nDOCTOR: I have no idea. But one thing they certainly aren’t is ghosts. They’re as real as you and me. Now, in the short term, might I suggest you customise your Sentries’ detection systems?\nVALLAN: Yes.. yes. Good idea. Sentries: offer yourselves to our Tech Lab team, relaying the Doctor’s suggestions.\nVALLAN: HOVER-SENTRIES : We comply.\nVALLAN: (FX: HOVER-SENTRIES HOVER ACROSS ROOM & EXIT THROUGH A SPECIAL SLOT, WHICH WHOOSHES SHUT AFTER THEM)\nDOCTOR: Since we’re now such good friends, I don’t suppose you could untie me?\nVALLAN: In due course, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: I’ve already told you I don’t respond well to forced interrogation. Why do authoritarian regimes always think torture is the answer? It’s never been proved to give reliable results.\nDOCTOR: 42\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 43\nVALLAN: We are in a state of emergency, Doctor. My predecessor, President Karnex, introduced it and I am maintaining it.\nDOCTOR: And I suppose Karnex did it for the benefit of society. Keep them in fear, keep them malleable.\nVALLAN: Karnex was a good man, a lover of peace. His contributions to Stronghaven were enormous: welfare reforms, public transport, the LifeSpan Project...\nDOCTOR: The LifeSpan Project — what was that?\nVALLAN: A dream, a vision of a better future. Sadly, since we now need to redirect the bulk of taxes to security, it may not happen for a decade. The idea was to prolong all our lives. It would have been the crowning glory of our Golden Age. Our scientists were making progress, but now it’s all on ice.\nDOCTOR: Good. Meddling with biological lifespans is never a good idea. When will people learn that eternal life is a curse, not a goal.\nVALLAN: The LifeSpan project does not aim for eternal life, Doctor, merely an extenuation of our current existence.\nDOCTOR: That’s how every quest for the elixir of life begins. I expect Karnex was afraid of death. Speaking of which — is there any security film of Karnex’s assassination?\nVALLAN: Why would you want to see that?\nDOCTOR: I’m an information magpie. The more info, the happier I am. Perhaps I can shed some light.\nVALLAN: There is no light to shed. We have Nia Brusk on film, shooting\nVALLAN: the President. Case closed.\nDOCTOR: I once assassinated a President myself.\nDOCTOR: 43\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 44\nVALLAN: What?!\nDOCTOR: They caught it on TV, too. Of course, I was innocent. The point is, Vallan, film can be faked. The fact that you have footage of Nia Brusk assassinating the President has prevented you from asking the most important question of all.\nVALLAN: And what’s that?\nDOCTOR: Why she assassinated him. May I see the footage?\nVALLAN: (SIGHS) I must be losing my mind. I’1l have it channelled through to the screen in here.\nDOCTOR: Incidentally, before I go to all the bother of helping you, can I quickly check that you didn’t arrange to have Karnex killed yourself?\nVALLAN: WHAT? !\nDOCTOR: Well, you’d be the prime suspect if I was heading an\nDOCTOR: investigation.\nVALLAN: I can assure you, Doctor, I’m the last person [in the world]-\nDOCTOR: All right, all right! Didn’t think so. Just checking.\nVALLAN: I’ll have it streamed in here. I need to attend to other\nVALLAN: matters.\nVALLAN: 44\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 45\nVALLAN: SCENE 27: INT. SENATE BUILDING (LIFT/CORRIDOR\nVALLAN: Miss Darone?

Now, why have you defied me?\nVALLAN: (GASPS, CHOKES) I... can’t.. expose this city.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: Can’t or won’t? I want access to Stronghaven and you’re going to give it to me.\nVALLAN: 45\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 46\nVALLAN: But you already have access. I don’t understand.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION] : You have sixty seconds to strip those defences down or the next time I control living human bones, it will be those of your precious Meera.\nVALLAN: (CROAKING) No...\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: The choice is yours, Vallan.\nVALLAN: (FX: KARNEX PARALYSIS CHIME FADES. VALLAN IS RELEASED, GETS BREATH BACK, CHOKING. THE LIFT DOOR OPENS)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (RUNNING UP) President Vallan, are you all right?\nVALLAN: Just a little... light-headed, Commander. You know how airless these lifts can get. Now, how are the security arrangements?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: In line with Miss Darone’s orders, we’re doubling the perimeter defences.\nVALLAN: Doubling, I ordered them halved.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Halved?\nVALLAN: Reduce perimeter defences to 20 per cent. If those things attack again, we’ll have plenty of time to divert troops to the affected areas. Our first priority must be maintaining law and order within the city. To that end, deploy the upgraded Sentries inside the city.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Inside, Sir?\nVALLAN: You heard me. Do it.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (REALLY UNSURE) Yes Sir.\nVALLAN: Oh, and Commander. I have another little task for you.\nVALLAN: 46\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 47\nVALLAN: SCENE 28: INT.

It is a price worth paying, to protect us against attacks from President Harmon’s surviving cult members.\nDOCTOR: So that’s what you looked like, Mr Karnex. Good beard.\nPRESIDENT KARNEX: As I stand here today, beneath our Great Hall’s historic dome, like my illustrious predecessors, I can assure you that Garrak’s fate shall not become our own. Furthermore, I would like to deny accusations that taxes allocated to the LifeSpan Project have been taxes wasted. We are still committed to—\nNIA: (IN CROWD) —-Die!\nPRESIDENT KARNEX: (IN B/G, UNDER DOCTOR’S NEXT LINE) Guards! Where did that come from?\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on. Where are you, Nia? Cameras going mad, trying to find you.. and there you are.\nDOCTOR: A life snatched away. And the Guards are hauling you off. (ALOUD) Pause. (FOOTAGE STOPS) Replay last ten seconds.\nDOCTOR: Stop. (VID CLIP STOPS) So it looks like you did it... but that’s not the Nia I met. There’s no hatred in those eyes. What was going on, inside your head? What?\nDOCTOR: To what do I owe the please, Commander Raynar?\nDOCTOR: 47\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 48\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (ENTERS) You are to be released and placed under my supervision, by order of the President.

It’s a big empty room — what’s the worst thing that could happen? They redecorate?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: These things are still pouring in from the forest, sir.\nDOCTOR: Look at them, Vallon: they’re like worker ants, right down to the distinct sense of purpose.

There’s definitely language being spoken, but the resonating cavities are all wrong... no flesh, you see. I’m hoping I can alter the resonation with my sonic screwdriver.\nMEERA: I’d hardly call that growling and snarling ‘speech’.\nMEERA: (FX: SKULL KEEPS GROWLING, GNASHING, SLIGHTLY MORE LIKE SPEECH AS THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER VIBRATES. )\nDOCTOR: Not speech as we know it, perhaps.

My guess is these bones aren’t free agents.\nVALLON: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: All they want is oblivion. But why seek it here? Why not simply stay in Garrak? Someone’s making them do this.

First, a laboratory in which to examine poor Yorick here. Second, I want you to send the Hover-Sentries to find my friend Mary and fly her back here to Stronghaven.\nVALLAN: Where were she and Nia Brusk heading when you left them?\nDOCTOR: To Garrak. They should have arrived by now.\nVALLAN: In that case, I’m afraid there’s no point in sending anyone after them. President Karnex declared Garrak a no-go zone, just days before his death.\nDOCTOR: So? Overrule him: you’re the President now.\nVALLAN: You don’t understand — and neither would Nia Brusk, since she was incarcerated at the time — the ruins of Garrak are massively radioactive.\nDOCTOR: What?\nVALLAN: It seems Harmon detonated the city’s main reactor core.

It’s never too late.\nVALLAN: Commander Raynar is monitoring the situation. Of course, you realise that we will re-arrest Nia Brusk on sight.\nDOCTOR: We can deal with that later. Her life comes first.\nDOCTOR: Now.. I’ve tried to enhance the resonance, with the aid of one of your rudimentary computers here. If only we had better equipment to work with, I could get some real answers.\nVALLAN: There’s sure to be more advanced equipment in President Karnex’s Vault. His work was cutting edge.\nDOCTOR: What sort of work?\nVALLAN: The LifeSpan project.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, you mentioned that before. Well why are we wasting time here? Let’s go to the vault.\nVALLAN: The vault is sealed, Doctor. Sealed forever. Only Karnex knew the encryption code and the secret died with him.\nDOCTOR: Great. Just great.

I wonder why the resonation ran out of control. Perhaps some kind of will power within the skull itself, manipulating the vibrations.\nVALLAN: Perhaps it would rather die than fail its mission.\nDOCTOR: Hardly. That was a tortured soul, not a zealous missionary. And we have a growing pile of them in the Great Hall. Unless you plan on building an extension, we need to find out what they want and who’s behind it.\nVALLAN: Well...

How big is it, Commander?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Approximately 30 metres in diameter, Doctor. It’s an invisible dome, encircling the bone-pile.\nDOCTOR: I see. Now that the bones are here, someone wants them to stay in position. But for what purpose?\nVALLAN: You don’t think they’re going to mount another attack, do you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m sure of it. For one thing, there’s still plenty of room for more bones inside that forcefield.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Mr President, I request permission to increase security at the main entrance?\nVALLAN: Permission denied, Commander.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: With respect, Sir, why?\nDOCTOR: Allow me to second that question, Mr President. Why?\nVALLAN: Doctor, I need to talk to you. Alone.\nDOCTOR: I see. Commander — any word on the progress of those Sentries heading for Garrak?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: I’m sorry, Doctor. They haven’t left the building. Once I discovered the forcefield, I needed them here.\nDOCTOR: To do what? Determine its shape and diameter? Something you could’ve done yourself with a stick?\nDOCTOR: 63\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 64\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: It seemed a more urgent priority.\nDOCTOR: Did it? Well my priority is with Mary Shelley — a young woman who has trusted me to protect her. Instead, I let her walk into a death-zone. If you’ve quite finished measuring your invisible dome, Commander, I’d like to borrow your Sentries — and three boxes of anti-radiation pills.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (GOING OFF) I’11 fetch you some.\nVALLAN: You can’t possibly be thinking of going to Garrak yourself?\nDOCTOR: If you want a job done properly, and all that. Now, authorize these Sentries to obey my commands.\nVALLAN: But, Doctor... I need to speak to you urgently.\nDOCTOR: Authorize them.\nVALLAN: Hover-Sentries (THEY HOVER CLOSER) — you will obey the Doctor’s commands henceforth.\nVALLAN: HOVER-SENTRIES #1 & #2: Understood.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (APPROACHING) Here, Doctor. The radiation pills.\nDOCTOR: (TAKING THEM) Thank you. (ALOUD) Sentries. Mesh protocol five.\nVALLON: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Engage traction lines. (THEY DEPLOY). No arguments, Varron. Once Mary and Nia are safe, I'll return. You have my word on it. (TO THE SENTRIES) Flybots — take me to Garrak!\nVALLAN: But Doctor...\nVALLAN: 64\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 65\nVALLAN: SCENE 38: EXT. GARRAK (ALLEYWAY)\nSTENNEN: I won’t say it again. Drop that crossbow, or we’1ll drop you.\nNIA: Who are you?\nTOX: (FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION) Do as he says: drop it. Now.\nMARY: Nia, do as they say. We cannot see their faces, but I very much feel their intent.\nSTENNEN: Good move. Now, you’re coming with us for a little ride in the\nSTENNEN: hover-car.\nTOX: The boss will want to see you.\nNIA: The boss?\nTOX: President Harmon.\nMARY: What?! But he’s—\nSTENNEN: That’s right, lady. We’re taking you to see a dead man.\nSTENNEN: 65\nSTENNEN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 66\nSTENNEN: SCENE 39: EXT. SKY (OVER FOREST)\nSTENNEN: HOVER-SENTRY #1: The metropolis of Garrak is one mile from this location.\nDOCTOR: The former metropolis, don’t you mean? Oh Mary, I let you walk into a big hole in the ground. Flybots—\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: We are not Flybots.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: We are Hover—Sentries.\nDOCTOR: And touchy ones at that. What do you have in your databanks on President Harmon?\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Three search results. ‘President Ramirez Harmon of Mexico,\nDOCTOR: Earth, 2017’. ‘President Elzaak Harmon of Tygon 3, the Tangier Spiral’. ‘President—\nDOCTOR: Now you’re just showing off. It has to be the third one. HOVER-SENTRY #2: ‘President Valek Harmon of Stronghaven, Zelonia, Draxine’.\nDOCTOR: What do you wish to know?\nDOCTOR: Whatever you’ve got. Forewarned is forearmed.\nDOCTOR: 66\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 67\nDOCTOR: SCENE 40: INT. SENATE BUILDING (PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE)\nVALLAN: (TO HIMSELF) What have I done? Stronghaven, I have failed you.\nMEERA: That’s putting it mildly.\nVALLAN: Meera! You startled me. How did you get in? Actually, that doesn’t matter. Listen Meera, I need to tell you something. It’s important. It’s about Stronghaven.\nMEERA: Stronghaven is no longer your concern. (CALLS) Commander.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: I’m ‘Sorry, Sir.\nVALLAN: What’s going on? Meera?\nMEERA: (SAD) You’re being deposed, John. The city’s governors have deemed that you acted against the good of the people — either through incompetence or in malice. As of 15 minutes ago, I became Stronghaven’s Acting President.\nVALLAN: What? But I... (HUSHED) Meera. It was for you. I did it all for you.\nMEERA: What? You compromised the city’s defences; you got men killed; you allowed a complete stranger to let you usher the living dead into our Great Hall and then steal our Hover-Sentries — and that was all for me? Forgive me, if I’m low on gratitude. I will, however, spare you the indignity of a cell. Commander, you will escort Mr Vallan to his chamber, then finalise arrangements for a maximum security presence around the Senate.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Madam President.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 67\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 68\nVALLAN: No, don’t do that. Please, Meera, I beg you. He’1ll control you, like he did me!\nMEERA: Who will? The Doctor?\nVALLAN: No, not the Doctor: Harmon! He’s still alive. He’s here, in the Senate! I’ve seen him.\nMEERA: You’ve seen him?\nVALLAN: He attacked me. He has some power over you mind. He’s the one controlling the skeletons — his warriors, he calls them. (BEAT) Meera?\nMEERA: (SAD) Escort Mr Vallan to his chamber, Commander. If he gives you any trouble, sedate him.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Yes, Ma’am. This way, sir.\nVALLAN: (BEING DRAGGED AWAY BY RAYNAR) Meera! Please! I’m telling the truth. You have to believe me! Meera!\nMEERA: (TO SELF) John... What’s happened to you?\nMEERA: 68\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 69\nMEERA: SCENE 41: EXT. SKY (ABOVE GARRAK)\nMEERA: HOVER-SENTRY #1: City of Garrak, directly below us.\nDOCTOR: Scan for Mary and Nia.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Scanning for life-forms designate Nia Bruck and Mary Shelley.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Scanning.\nDOCTOR: Good luck. Big city.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRIES TOGETHER: Subjects located.\nDOCTOR: You’re kidding. Where are they?\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Beneath the former Azran Factory.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2 Directly below us.\nDOCTOR: Are they alone?\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: No. There are three other lifeforms in the vicinity.\nDOCTOR: Anyone you recognise?\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Negative.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2:\nDOCTOR: One guards the factory. The other two are three floors below ground level.\nDOCTOR: 69\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 70\nDOCTOR: Put me down around the side of the building — away from where the guard is.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Approaching ground level.\nDOCTOR: Whoah, slow down — I much prefer my legs unbroken.\nDOCTOR: (HUSHED) There. Now unhook and unmesh me.\nDOCTOR: (FX: HOOKS REMOVE FROM MESH. OVER FOLLOWING LINE, THE MESH UNWRAPS, WITH A METALLIC WHOOSH)\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Now stay close — I’ve a feeling I’1ll be needing you.\nDOCTOR: 70\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 71\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42: INT. GARRAK (AZRAN FACTORY STAIRCASE)\nSTENNEN: Come on, keep moving. Won’t do to keep the President waiting.\nMARY: (SOTTO) Deeper and deeper. Where do you think these stairs lead?\nNIA: (SOTTO) To our almost certain deaths. Harmon’s crazy and so are his acolytes. First chance we get, we escape.\nMARY: (SOTTO) You are good at that. I am skilled only in escaping my\nMARY: own emotions.\nNIA: (SOTTO) Stay strong, Mary. I won’t leave you.\nSTENNEN: Enough whispering. An audience with President Harmon awaits.\nSTENNEN: (FX: THEY ARRIVE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS & STOP. STENNEN OPENS A RUSTY METAL DOOR)\nSTENNEN: After you, ladies.\nSTENNEN: 71\nSTENNEN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 72\nSTENNEN: SCENE 43: INT. GARRAK (AZRAN FACTORY, HARMON’S LAIR)\nMARY: (FEARFUL) By all the saints... what is that?\nSTENNEN: This is President Harmon.\nHARMON: (50s, SOFT VOICE WITH LIGHT BUBBLING EFFECT) Forgive me if my appearance disturbs you. Without these many tubes and pistons, what’s left of my body would have long since perished.\nNIA: Like the thousands of innocent Garraks you destroyed. You... you abomination!\nSTENNEN: (GRABBING NIA) You will address the President with respect.\nHARMON: Release her, Mr Stennen. The young woman shows passion, courage and a commendable honesty. What is your name, child?\nNIA: More important is my husband’s name: Skylon Brusk. Before I die here, I need to know the truth about his fate.\nNIA: 72\nNIA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 73\nNIA: SCENE 44: EXT. GARRAK (AZRAN FACTORY, STAIRS)\nTOX: Stop right there. (FX: FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE) I said stop!\nDOCTOR: Please, throw the gun aside. You know this won’t end well.\nTOX: For you, you mean.\nTOX: (FX: THE HOVER-SENTRIES APPEAR & FLOAT EITHER SIDE OF THE DOCTOR)\nTOX: HOVER-SENTRY #1: You will lower you weapon.\nTOX: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Any attempt at aggression will be met with instant retaliation.\nDOCTOR: You were saying?\nTOX: Who... who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor. Who are you?\nTOX: My name's... Tox.\nDOCTOR: Glad to meet you, Tox. I wonder if you’d mind lowering your hood: I find it difficult to converse with articles of clothing.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: You will comply.\nTOX: I’m complying. (DOING SO) Happy now? I’ve got burns on my arms, too, if you want to gawp.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t have any stochastic scarring. In fact, no signs of radiation sickness at all. Interesting. Tell me: from where do you get your anti-radiation pills?\nDOCTOR: 73\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 74\nTOX: There’s no radiation here. That’s just Karnex propaganda.\nDOCTOR: Really? If that’s true, you’ve made me a very happy Doctor. Now whose little fortress might this be?\nTOX: You a Stronghaven spy?\nDOCTOR: I’m a free agent, Tox. Listen: two of my friends have just entered this factory, almost certainly against their will. I'd very much like to make sure they’re safe.\nTOX: They’re safe. They’re with the boss.\nDOCTOR: And who might he be?\nTOX: President Harmon.\nDOCTOR: Well, well. Lead on, Tox. It’s been a good few hours since I last spoke to a dead person.\nDOCTOR: 74\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 75\nDOCTOR: SCENE 45: INT. SENATE BUILDING (VALLAN’S CHAMBER)\nVALLAN: I said, open this door.\nAUTOMATIC VOICE: Door control suspended.\nVALLAN: (GETTING WEAKER) Oh, no. Not now.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]:\nVALLAN: From President of Stronghaven to misbehaving child, stuck in his room. Things haven’t worked out well for you, Vallan, have they?\nVALLAN: (WEAK) I did everything you asked.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: Only because you didn’t have a chance to talk to this meddling imposter, ‘The Doctor’. I see and hear all, Vallan.\nVALLAN: I wasn’t going to tell him. I just wanted to know about the bones in the Great Hall.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]:\nVALLAN: You’1l find out — in time. Now I must pay my respects to\nVALLAN: Stronghaven’s new Acting President.\nVALLAN: Meera? No. Leave her alone.\nVALLAN: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: The final phase begins very soon. Goodbye, Vallan.\nVALLAN: Meera. (SHOUTS) Meera!\nVALLAN: 75\nVALLAN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 76\nVALLAN: SCENE 46: INT. GARRAK (AZRAN FACTORY, STAIRS)\nTOX: We’re almost there, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Why do despots always bury themselves in the earth? Must be something primal.\nTOX: We're here. President Harmon is through this door. (SCARED) Are you... are you going to kill him?\nDOCTOR: I’d rather not. It all depends on how many of his skeletal\nDOCTOR: warriors he has in there and what he chooses to do with them.\nTOX: There’s no-one in there but his assistant: Mr Stennen.\nDOCTOR: Just two people to guard this great cult leader?\nTOX: Everyone else is out gathering, or on patrol.\nDOCTOR: That’s Nia, crying. Sentries: blast this door down.\nTOX: Please don’t harm him!\nTOX: 76\nTOX: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 77\nTOX: SCENE 47: INT. GARRAK (AZRAN FACTORY, HARMON’S LAIR)\nMARY: Doctor! Oh my goodness!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Mary.\nSTENNAN: Who the [hell]-\nSTENNAN: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Remain motionless.\nSTENNAN: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Do not move.\nSTENNAN: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Drop the weapon.\nSTENNEN: All right. (HE DOES SO)\nHARMON: A spectacular entrance. I congratulate you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, President Harmon. Mary, Nia, take these pills. (HE SHAKES THEM) Just in case.\nHARMON: There’s no need, I assure you. There is no radiation risk.\nDOCTOR: I’d rather be safe than sorry. Mary, what’s going on here?\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter with Nia — is she hurt?\nMARY: Nia’s husband perished in the Garrak explosion.\nHARMON: He was one of my finest Ministers. Tragically the building in which he worked was at the epicentre of the blast.\nHARMON: 77\nHARMON: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 78\nDOCTOR: Tragically? Don’t you mean ‘gloriously’ or ‘joyously’. Wasn’t it the culmination of your grand plan?\nHARMON: Do I look like a man who deliberately triggered a massive explosion in his own city?\nDOCTOR: You tell me. As suicidal fanatics go, you tick all the boxes.\nSTENNEN: You people are so stupid — you’1ll believe anything!\nMARY: But if Harmon didn’t blow up Garrak, who did?\nHARMON: President Karnex.\nDOCTOR: Karnex? !\nMARY: Who’s he?\nDOCTOR: Stronghaven’s former President. Assassinated only a few days ago by Nia here.\nMARY: Nia? But I-\nNIA: I’m sorry, Mary. I never plucked up the courage to tell you.\nDOCTOR: But why would Karnex want to destroy Garrak?\nSTENNEN: Two words: money and power.\nHARMON: The public perception was that Karnex and I had the perfect relationship. Behind the scenes, the two of us were at war. You name it, we disagreed on it. Trade issues, especially.\nSTENNEN: Karnex began to spread rumours that the President here was a lunatic and that Garrak was being infected by his cult.\nSTENNEN: 78\nSTENNEN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 79\nHARMON: Three weeks ago, an unmarked hover-car landed in our central Grand Square and stopped dead. One of our security teams arrested the driver and discovered a massive bomb inside. As they worked to defuse it, Karnex called me, laughed and said just one word: “Goodbye”. I managed to get halfway into my panic room before the entire city seemed to heave, then go black. The next thing I remember, I woke up strapped to this machine. Stennen here saved me: he’s a surgeon you know.\nMARY: Is that why you assassinated him, Nia? In revenge?\nNIA: I had no idea of what he’d done to Garrak.\nDOCTOR: Then why kill him?\nNIA: I couldn’t help it. Something took control of me.\nMARY: Took control?\nNIA: It was like I was watching someone else do everything. Without really wanting to, I broke out of detention, stole a gun and shot Karnex where he stood on that stage. It was terrifying.\nDOCTOR: Yes! That’s the look in your eyes on that footage: terror. Harmon, was this your doing? Did you make Nia kill Karnex?\nHARMON: I can assure you, Doctor, that if I had that kind of power I would have unhesitatingly used it to against Karnex, in revenge for what he did to me and my people. Sadly, I do not possess that ability.\nDOCTOR: Nor, I take it, can you bring the dead back to life?\nHARMON: Then the rumours are true? There really is an army of the\nHARMON: dead?\nHARMON: 79\nHARMON: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 80\nDOCTOR: By the sound of it, they’re right above us.\nTOX: (PANTING) I went to look up-top. The ground’s shifting, all around — moving like it’s alive.\nDOCTOR: Harmon — how many people were working in this building on the\nDOCTOR: day of the explosion.\nHARMON: I don’t know: two, perhaps three thousand.\nHARMON: (FX: A POWERFUL RUMBLE SHAKES THE BUILDING. THE WHOLE STRUCTURE GROANS. )\nMARY: You surely can’t mean -?\nDOCTOR: I surely can. They’re all waking up, moving, clawing their way to the surface.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Infrastructure becoming increasingly unstable.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Urgent evacuation recommended.\nNIA: We need to get up top.\nMARY: To join an army of the dead?\nDOCTOR: If we stay here, we’re dead for sure.\nHARMON: Go, all of you.\nSTENNEN: I’m not leaving you, Mr President.\nSTENNEN: 80\nSTENNEN: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 81\nHARMON: Mr Stennen, go with them. I always knew this would be my tomb.\nHARMON: (FX: A BLOCK OF STONE FALLS FROM THE CEILING, SMASHES INTO THE GROUND. EVERYONE GASPS/SCREAMS )\nDOCTOR: The roof’s collapsing! Tox: you lead the way. Flybots — you next. Mary and Nia, no questions... go!\nDOCTOR: (PAUSING IN THE DOORWAY) President Harmon, it was an unexpected pleasure to meet you. I will spread the truth about you and this city, as best I can.\nHARMON: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mr Stennen, we’ll keep the stairwell clear for as long as we can.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR DASHES OFF. WHOLE BUILDING SHAKES AGAIN. ANOTHER BLOCK FALLS FROM THE CEILING, HITS THE GROUND)\nHARMON: This is your last chance, Mr Stennen.\nSTENNEN: No, Sir — this is my last act. Ensuring that you don’t die\nSTENNEN: alone.\nSTENNEN: (FX: ENTIRE CEILING CRASHES IN. HARMON & STENNEN’S MUFFLED CRIES. TANK SMASHES, WATER SPLASHES.

Follow Tox’s lead —\nDOCTOR: he’s like a March hare.\nMARY: (STUMBLES) Doctor, I- !\nNIA: (CATCHING HER) I’ve got you.\nTOX: (FROM ABOVE) The door’s jammed! Hang on. I'll -\nDOCTOR: Tox, no! It could mean the wall above it’s unstable!\nTOX: Arrrrggg—(CUT SHORT) (FX: DEBRIS SETTLES)\nMARY: How horrible.\nNIA: We’re trapped!\nDOCTOR: It certainly looks that way.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Step aside from the blockage.\nDOCTOR: Ah!

Have you retrieved those Hover-Sentries yet?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (D) Working on it now, ma’am. They don’t seem to be responding.\nMEERA: What was Vallan thinking? Commander, I want those Sentries back here immediately, guarding the Senate. See to it.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (D) Madam President — I’m accessing their systems right now and it looks like trouble’s on its way.\nMEERA: Trouble?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (D) Skeletons — thousands of them — heading towards Stronghaven.\nMEERA: At least this time we’ll be ready for them. I want them blown apart and ground into dust. Have the Sentries attack them from above, on their way back here, too.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (D) Very good, ma’am.\nMEERA: Report back, Commander. Over and out.\nMEERA: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: Hello Meera. Nice office.\nMEERA: 83\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 84\nMEERA: Who’s that?! Where are you?!\nMEERA: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: You shouldn’t have doubted Vallan. For once in his miserable life, he was right. Now stand up.\nMEERA: No. I refuse.\nMEERA: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: You can’t refuse Bone Control, my dear. Now, let’s go for a little walk, shall we? Over to Stronghaven’s Control Centre.\nMEERA: (STRUGGLING) I won’t do this. I will fight you.\nMEERA: KARNEX [PROJECTION]: Fight all you like. Nia Brusk tried to resist and failed — and she’s twice as pig-headed as you.\nMEERA: (STRUGGLING) Brusk? You mean you made her assassinate Karnex? Then she isn’t a murderer?\nMEERA: KARNEX [PROJECTION]:\nMEERA: She never was. President Karnex is very much alive, Meera my dear.

We just happened to be in their way.\nMARY: You’1ll not persuade me that those creatures are harmless.\nDOCTOR: Most certainly not. But they’re only programmed to kill if someone obstructs their mission.\nNIA: They’re puppets. Just like me when I killed Karnex.\nDOCTOR: Except these dead souls are somehow trapped inside their own bones.\nMARY: That is quite the most horrendous thing I have ever heard.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it just? Now, delightful company as you two ladies are, I think it’s time we slipped out of our fishnets and into something more comfortable. (THE DOCTOR ACTIVATES THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER.

Now, as far as I can remember, the north side is just around this corner.\nMARY: Do not take us too near the cliffs, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mary, Mary, you know you’re always perfectly safe with—\nDOCTOR: (FX: SINGLE RAPID-FIRE BURST, FROM NEAR DISTANCE. SOME BULLETS ‘ZING’ THE HOVER-CAR, WHICH KEEPS ZOOMING)\nDOCTOR: MARY & NIA: Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: Is there ANYONE who doesn’t want to shoot at us today?!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (APPROACHING — WE GET CLOSER TO HIM) Ceasefire! Ceasefire!\nDOCTOR: I recognize that voice!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (VOICE RISES IN VOLUME AS WE ARRIVE BESIDE HIM) For God’s sake, Private! Do these people LOOK like the living dead? In a hover-car? Sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Quite all right, Commander. How goes it?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Not well, Doctor. I’m trying to reach President Darone and I can’t even manage that.\nNIA: Meera Darone is President?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (REALISING) Nia Brusk! Stay where you are — you’re under arrest.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 91\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 92\nNIA: I’ve returned of my own free will. To help.\nMARY: Nia speaks the truth. She was under someone else’s control when she killed Karnex, just like these walking dead.\nDOCTOR: Can we deal with more pressing issues, Commander — like the dead having already gained access to the Senate?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Impossible! We’ve held the North entrance.\nDOCTOR: But you haven’t held the west wall. The skeletons are getting in via the sewers.\nMEERA: (DISTORT) Commander Raynar! Something terrible is about to happen in the Great Hall. President Karnex is far from the man we thought he was — and I think he’s coming back!\nMEERA: SCENE 54: EXT. STRONGHAVEN (STREETS)\nMEERA: (P.A. DISTORT) People of Stronghaven. This is your Acting President, Meera Darone, standing in for President Vallan, who has been taken ill. Please do not be alarmed by the pyrotechnic display currently underway outside the city walls. This is a military training exercise. We are not, I repeat not, under attack.\nMEERA: 92\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 93\nMEERA: SCENE 55: INT. SENATE BUILDING (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: Military training exercise, my foot.\nMEERA: (P.A. DISTORT, B/G, DURING THE FOLLOWING) However, we do need to conduct an urgent maintenance check on the security systems in city streets. This check will require the streets to be clear. So I’1ll need you all to return to your homes within the next 30 minutes and remain there until further notice. There is absolutely no reason to be concerned by this. Thank you.\nNIA: Listen to her, lying through her teeth.\nDOCTOR: It’s a recording. That’s not the Meera we just heard.\nMARY: Meera said something about Karnex coming back, Doctor. What did she mean?\nDOCTOR: I have a theory, but it’s not a very pleasant one. How far to the Great Hall, Commander?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Just around this corner... Oh.\nMARY: There must be hundreds of them.\nDOCTOR: Well, we’ll never get through there. If we get in their way, we'll be torn apart. Is there another way into that Hall, Commander?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: A ventilation panel. This way!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 93\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 94\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: SCENE 56: INT. SENATE BUILDING (VALLAN’S CHAMBER)\nVALLAN: For the last time: let me out of this chamber!\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Your Presidential privileges have been revoked. Exit denied.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Access being granted from outside.\nVALLAN: Meera!\nMEERA: John! Forgive me. I should have listened. Karnex controlled me, just as he controlled you. He released me, but he’s about to do something terrible!\nVALLAN: Karnex?! You mean Harmon?!\nMEERA: No — Karnex. I’1l explain along the way.\nVALLAN: Where are we going?\nMEERA: The Great Hall.\nMEERA: 94\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 95\nMEERA: SCENE 57: INT. SENATE BUILDING (GREAT HALL)\nMEERA: (FX: GROWLS, CLICK-CLACKS, BONES PILING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER, CONTINUOUS. COMMANDER RAYNAR KICKS IN A VENTILATION PANEL & THE DOCTOR & CO EMERGE INTO THE GREAT HALL)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Here we are, Doctor.\nMARY: Look at that Golgotha!\nNIA: The mountain of bones is almost touching the glass dome!\nDOCTOR: And because it’s still inside that forcefield, we can’t lay a finger on it.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Looks like the last of them are joining the pile now, Doctor. (FX: BONES HIT THE MOUNTAIN) They’ve achieved their objective.\nDOCTOR: I wish that was true, Commander. I fear this is only the beginning.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BONES SLOWLY START TO MOVE. MASS CLICK-CLACKS, CONTINUOUS )\nMARY: It’s moving. The mountain is moving!\nDOCTOR: See that glow around the whole pile? It’s shifting. Coalescing. Becoming...\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Becoming what, Doctor?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FX: KARNEX’S VOICE RISES FROM A GROAN TO A BOOMING ROAR, OVER THE FOLLOWING)\nMARY: It’s taking the shape of... of a man!\nNIA: An effigy of Karnex! It even has his face.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: That head’s going to hit the dome!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 95\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 96\nDOCTOR: Everyone get back!\nDOCTOR: (FX: HUGE CRASH OF GLASS BREAKING. GLASS SHOWERS DOWN, HITS THE GROUND. FROM NOW ON, WIND IS AUDIBLE. KARNEX’S LAUGHTER BOOMS )\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: I... am... reborn! Behold: The Bone Lord!\nNIA: I don’t understand. Karnex is dead: I shot him!\nDOCTOR: It seems death was just a passing phase.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: From here, I can see across the entire land. And I am the lord of all I survey. The LifeSpan Project is a triumph!\nDOCTOR: The LifeSpan project! So that’s it.\nNIA: What does he mean?\nNIA: KARNEX [GIANT]: Is that Nia I spy down there? Thank you for terminating my Earthly existence. I owe you so much.\nNIA: (ANGRY) Oh, don’t worry, I owe you too.\nNIA: (FX: DOORS BURST OPEN. VALLAN & MEERA RUN IN. WE SWAP TO THEIR POSITION)\nVALLAN: What in heaven’s name-?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM) Madam President. Mr Vallon. Get back into the corridor.\nMEERA: Karnax! You monster!\nMEERA: KARNEX [GIANT]: “Monster”, Meera? Hardly. I am a brand new deity — and you will serve me as you served me before. My puppet government!\nMEERA: Never!\nMEERA: 96\nMEERA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 97\nVALLON: We serve Stronghaven. We’ll never serve you.\nVALLON: KARNEX [GIANT]: As you wish. (GROWLS! )\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Look out, both of you!\nDOCTOR: VALLAN & MEERA:\nDOCTOR: (FX: HUGE BONY FOOT HITS THE FLOOR WITH AN AFTERSHOCK. VALLAN AND MEERA’S SCREAMS STOP. )\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: So disappointing when toys break.\nDOCTOR: All of you, back into the ventilation shaft. Now.\nMARY: What are you going to do?\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]: Yes, little scurrying man. What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m not entirely sure, but something like this.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) Wait, what is this?! (LANDS A BLOW AGAINST THE FORCEFIELD, IT REBOUNDS) What have you done, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Turned your own forcefield against you. Now nothing can get in or out. Speaking of which, everybody out through the ventilation shaft! Now! Come on!!!\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED. RAGE) Run, Doctor, run! Enjoy your last moments of liberty. I shall shatter this forcefield and then I shall shatter you. Bone by bone.\nDOCTOR: 97\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 98\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57: INT. SENATE BUILDING (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: (FX: KICK OPEN THE VENTILATION SHAFT & SPEW INTO THE CORRIDOR. SETTLE, OUT OF BREATH)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: All right, Doctor, that’s everybody out. What now?\nDOCTOR: Commander, I need you to break into the President’s vault. Use brute force if you have to — we must get access to the Karnex’s Tech Lab.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Consider it done.\nDOCTOR: Mary, Nia: go with him. Find out everything you can about the LifeSpan project — notes, technology, computer files. It’s the source of Karnex’s powers, so the more we know about it, the better.\nNIA: And what are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: I’m heading back in. Someone has to keep Karnex busy while you lot break into his lab.\nMARY: I’m coming too, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mary, that forcefield is unstable. He could break free at any moment.\nMARY: Then you will need help. I won’t let you face that creature alone.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right — just follow my lead. Commander, Nia:\nDOCTOR: we'll hopefully see you soon.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Good luck, Doctor. (HE & NIA DASH OFF)\nDOCTOR: We'll need it.\nDOCTOR: 98\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 99\nDOCTOR: SCENE 58: INT. SENATE BUILDING (GREAT HALL)\nDOCTOR: Karnex. I hope you didn’t get too depressed all on your lonesome. (ALMIGHTY, GROANING CLICK-CLACK OF BONES) Please, don’t get up on our account.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Every minute you stand before me, Doctor, I grow more powerful. I’ve never felt so much vitality coursing through me. Who would have thought that so much death could give one man such life?\nMARY: Who would have wanted it? You have turned yourself into a vile abomination.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, CALMING) Mary...\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) Such spirit, in one so young. I can hardly wait to crush you in my hand and watch it all drain away.\nDOCTOR: Tell me about the LifeSpan Project, Karnex. I must concede to being impressed with the results.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) So you should, Doctor. You are gazing upon The Bone Lord. The mightiest being in all creation.\nMARY: You are an obscenity.\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nMARY: (MUFFLED) Your companion can barely control her emotions, Doctor. And yet you remain rational. I can only assume you are a man of science.\nDOCTOR: And that’s why I’m so fascinated to hear more about the LifeSpan Project.\nMARY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Play along. We need information. (ALOUD) It truly is a scientific marvel.\nDOCTOR: 99\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 100\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) My scientists stumbled upon a bold new technology, Doctor. It allows one’s psychic cloud to be placed in storage.\nDOCTOR: ‘Psychic cloud?’ Er... Very interesting. You cloned your mind?\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) My soul, yes.\nMARY: Your soul?\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we could debate ‘mind versus soul’ for hours. Sadly, we’re rather pressed for time. So: you backed up your soul...\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) By the time Nia Brusk punctured my mortal shell with a bullet, my soul had been safely duplicated.\nDOCTOR: You can’t have done all this on your own. You must have had lab assistants.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) Oh, I did. Hundreds of them. The finest minds on the planet.\nMARY: Where are they now?\nMARY: (FX: FROM THIS POINT, THE MUFFLING BEGINS TO DIMINISH AS THE FORCEFIELD WEAKENS IMPERCEPTIBLY )\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) Once their work was done, I sent them on a celebratory day-trip to Garrak.\nDOCTOR: Really. And I wonder which day that just happened to be...\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (MUFFLED) I abhor loose ends, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Speaking of which: what did you put in the Garrak bomb, to enable you to control the dead?\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) The bomb was laced with the same psychic isotopes I used to duplicate my soul. Once they enter the marrow, they allow me to directly link my mind to the bones of the dead.\nDOCTOR: 100\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 101\nDOCTOR: But not all at once, eh? It took practice, didn’t it? You could only control a few skeletons at a time. Then as you got better at it, more and more until you could bring all of Garrak’s dead here.\nMARY: That explains why they could move faster and faster each time.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Like and infant, Karnex here had to learn to walk before he could run.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (NO MUFFLING BY NOW) Congratulations, Doctor. Now that you know everything, you can die happy.\nMARY: The forcefield?\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nMARY: Fizzled out a whole minute ago, but I was enjoying our chat. (FX: SLOW, BIG FOOTSTEPS SHAKE THE FLOOR) It’s crunch time, Doctor.\nMARY: (FX: FROM ABOVE, TWO SETS OF LASER PULSES FIRE ON KARNEX. HE ROARS IN PAIN)\nDOCTOR: The flybots!\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #1: Acts of aggression will not be tolerated.\nDOCTOR: HOVER-SENTRY #2: Desist or there will be reprisals.\nDOCTOR: Time to make a discreet exit, I think. Come on, you. (LEAVES)\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (GROWLS, IRRITATED) You think you mechanical insects can stop me, the great Karnex? I’ll crush you! (BATTLE ROAR)\nDOCTOR: (FX: ROOF PULLED APART, HURLED DOWN, HITS THE FLOOR, LASER ZAPS — BATTLE IN FULL SWING)\nDOCTOR: 101\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 102\nDOCTOR: SCENE 59: INT. SENATE BUILDING (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: (FX: BACKGROUND THROUGHOUT — BATTLE RAGES BETWEEN KARNEX AND HOVER-SENTRIES. LASER-FIRE, MUFFLED KARNEX ROARS)\nMARY: (HURRYING) Where to now?\nDOCTOR: (HURRYING) The Tech Lab. Let’s hope Raynar’s got it open.\nMARY: You were fascinated, weren’t you? In there.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nMARY: Even when you’re gazing up at a giant who is constructed from living death, you can’t help but be fascinated. (SHE STOPS; HE TOO) How can such a sight not churn your very stomach?\nDOCTOR: Mary, we haven’t time for this. We have to focus on stopping Karnex before he tears this whole place, and us, apart.\nMARY: Answer me! How can it not churn your stomach?\nDOCTOR: In a way, I wish it sickened me more.\nMARY: But how can it not?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Mary. If you could only spend one minute in my head...\nMARY: My husband Percy: yes, he can be highly desensitised. But in his case, laudanum is to blame. Tell me Doctor — what is your excuse?\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]: (DISTANT, HIDE & SEEK STYLE) Doctor... where arrrrre you?! (LAUGHS) I’ve crushed these ridiculous tincans.\nDOCTOR: The Lab — quick!\nDOCTOR: 102\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 103\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60: INT. SENATE BUILDING (TECH LAB)\nDOCTOR: (FX: LABORATORY BLEEPING ATMOS. DISTANT DESTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR AND MARY RUN IN)\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Doctor! As you can see, the vault door finally yielded to concentrated fire.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Commander. Now — Karnex is heading this way. Anything you can do to slow him?\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: I’1ll post guards along the corridor outside. Good luck, Doctor. (CALLING) Transen, Carpell, Brandar — with me!\nNIA: Doctor — the LifeSpan Project seems to consist of just this machine, attached to this chair.\nDOCTOR: This must be where Karnex cloned his mind — or his soul. He transformed it into a cloud of psychic isotopes which could live on inside bone marrow and which, through a process I don’t fully understand, were susceptible to thought control. That’s how he puppeteered you, Nia, and made you kill his physical self.\nMARY: But why did he want to die?\nDOCTOR: Oh, nothing guarantees martyrdom like an assassination. And Nia’s insurgency marked her out as a convincing assassin.\nMARY: What can you do to stop the machine, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not a great deal. If I destroy it, the radiation released\nDOCTOR: might result in another Garrak-style explosion.\nNIA: Then what can be done?\nNIA: 103\nNIA: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 104\nDOCTOR: The only thing I can think of. I’m going to feed my mind into the machine’s psychic cloud.\nMARY: No!\nDOCTOR: It’s the only way! If I’m right, it’ll allow me to fight Karnex\nDOCTOR: for control of the Bone Lord.\nMARY: And if you’re wrong?\nDOCTOR: It’s been nice knowing you.\nDOCTOR: (FX: DISTANT STOMPING. CRASHING DESTRUCTION. RAPID GUNFIRE. SCREAMS FROM GUARDS, CONTINUOUS )\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (DISTANT) Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Here he comes. Mary: strap me in. Nia: fire up the machine!\nDOCTOR: 104\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 105\nDOCTOR: SCENE 61: SENATE BUILDING (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: (FX: RAPID-FIRE BURSTS AND CORRIDOR WALL/CEILING DESTRUCTION THROUGHOUT )\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (LAUGHS) How the Senate crumbles at the Bone Lord’s touch.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: This is for Vallan and Darone!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: KARNEX [GIANT]: Ah! Commander Raynar — my toy soldier.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: Let me go, you freak!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: KARNEX [GIANT]: I certainly shall let you go...\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: (FX: HORRIBLE CRUNCH) Arggggghhh!\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: KARNEX [GIANT]: . into the great beyond.\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: 105\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 106\nCOMMANDER RAYNAR: SCENE 62: INT. SENATE BUILDING (TECH LAB)\nDOCTOR: Nia, you need to place that rather attractive Psychic Cloud Regulator on my head.\nNIA: (AT THE MACHINE) Understood. I need to stabilize the energy flow first.\nMARY: Even now, you find humour?\nDOCTOR: When you’ve seen as much darkness and bloodshed as I have, across hundreds of years, you learn to wrest enjoyment from every single heartsbeat. If I let everything get to me, I might as well join the walking dead myself.\nMARY: Doctor... Please, I beg you, don’t do this.\nDOCTOR: There’s no alternative.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ENORMOUS TEARING CRUNCH OF BRICK AND MORTAR. DEBRIS RAINS DOWN. MARY SCREAMS )\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: (TOWERING ABOVE) There you are, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Karnex... we need to talk.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: The time for talking has long passed. It’s time for demonstrations of godly might. The Bone Lord crushes all!\nDOCTOR: But to what end, Karnex?\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nDOCTOR: Purity, Doctor. Nothing extraneous. No fat. A mortal man, reduced to bare bones. Absolute, ultimate simplicity, yet wielding the utmost power! I shall be worshipped.\nMARY: People will worship you through fear. The lowest possible form of power.\nMARY: 106\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 107\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]: Judge how ‘low’ my power feels when I crush the life from you!\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Connection established. Thirty seconds until direct transfer.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISE) Nia — what are you doing?! Remove the crown and leave that chair at once!\nNIA: I’m sorry, Doctor. We both know there’s no going back once the connection’s established. You might be able to fool Mary, but you can’t fool me: to transfer your soul you have to die. And that’s just what I intend to do.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Twenty seconds until direct transfer.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: KARNEX [GIANT]: You desecrate my throne with your filthy flesh. Leave it at once.\nNIA: Careful, Karnex. If you damage this chair, you might lose your precious mind control. And then where would you be? A bag of bones.\nNIA: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Ten seconds until direct transfer.\nMARY: Nia, please don’t do this. Doctor — please stop her.\nDOCTOR: Nia, there’s another way.\nNIA: I’ve lost everything I ever cared for: my city, my people, my\nNIA: husband. You have each other: Mary and the Doctor. Be happy.\nMARY: (HEARTBROKEN) Nia!\nMARY: 107\nMARY: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 108\nNIA: Look out, Karnex. This time I choose to become your assassin! (DYING PAIN) Arrrgghhh!\nMARY: Nia!\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Direct transfer complete.\nMARY: She’s gone?!\nMARY: KARNEX [GIANT]: (LAUGHS) Pathetic! Her feeble soul could not effect the transfer. I win!\nDOCTOR: Are you so sure, Karnex?\nMARY: Doctor? What is it?\nDOCTOR: Nia’s psychic cloud.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: And it’s about to be dispersed. Come, Nia, wherever you are: let us end this.\nDOCTOR: NIA [SPECTRAL]: (CRY OF RAGE) Fight me now!\nDOCTOR: KARNEX & NIA:\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: Haha! You cannot take this body, Nia. It is mine!\nDOCTOR: If anyone has the right to control the fate of Garrak’s dead, Karnex, it’s Nia. And you forget that, when that’s put to the vote, the dead are likely to agree.\nDOCTOR: 108\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 109\nMARY: Doctor! The bones — they’re screaming!\nDOCTOR: Hear that, Karnex? The polls are not looking good.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]: No! I rule you all! Do not let her in! I am your leader. I AM\nDOCTOR: you!\nDOCTOR: Not any more. The King is dead... long live the Queen.\nDOCTOR: KARNEX [GIANT]:\nDOCTOR: NIA [GIANT]: (EXHAUSTED, BOOMING, ABOVE) Karnex.. Karnex has gone. I did it...\nMARY: Yes! Nia, you did! Well done!\nMARY: Nia? Where’s she going, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Now comes the really hard part. Come.\nDOCTOR: 109\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 110\nDOCTOR: SCENE 63: EXT. OUTSIDE STRONGHAVEN\nMARY: Doctor, where is she going? I can’t see in this damned\nMARY: twilight!\nDOCTOR: The cliff edge, Mary.\nMARY: No. (CALLING) Nia, don’t do this. The Doctor may find a way to\nMARY: revive you! We can could reverse the process.\nMARY: NIA [GIANT]: I am so tired. Goodbye, Mary. Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Nia. You saved the world.\nMARY: NO! Nia!\nMARY: (FX: BEAT, THEN AN ALMIGHTY CRASH OF SPLINTERED BONE ON ROCKS BELOW)\nMARY: Oh, Doctor. (BURSTS INTO TEARS)\nDOCTOR: Come here. (HOLDS HER) We should head into the forest and find\nDOCTOR: the TARDIS. Stronghaven and Garrak will rebuild themselves. In time.\nDOCTOR: 110\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 111\nDOCTOR: SCENE 64: INT. TARDIS (CONSOLE ROOM)\nDOCTOR: It seems Karnex was dependable only when it came to lies. The scanner confirms there’s not a scrap of radiation about you. Are you all right?\nMARY: I.. don’t entirely know what I am. Or what I now want to do.\nDOCTOR: Mary, I’m constantly amazed that anyone chooses to join me on this rollercoaster. The highs are about as high as you can get. But the lows... well, you’ve now seen the seventh circle. I hope you don’t think too badly of me.\nMARY: How could I? You were going to sacrifice your life for people you didn’t even know, before Nia had to step in. But given what I said to you, in the forest... well, maybe it’s all just too complicated now.\nDOCTOR: Surely our friendship will endure, Mary, after all this time we've spent together? After the adventures we’ve had? The Cybermen, the witches, the Bone Lord?\nMARY: Of course: we shall be friends forever. In fact, I.. I want you to have this. (HANDS HIM HER JOURNAL) It is finally full.\nDOCTOR: Your journal? I couldn’t possibly.\nMARY: I want you to know what goes through the head of a person who travels with you. The good and the bad. How some of the things you consider commonplace and ordinary, can send fireworks soaring through the minds of others. Promise me that you will read it.\nDOCTOR: I certainly will. It’s not everyday one gets to read a new work by Mary Shelley!\nMARY: Why do you say my name this way? Is that sarcasm?\nDOCTOR: Never. Nor, I hope, irony. (THEY LAUGH) Please stay, Mary. I have so much more to show you.\nDOCTOR: 111\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR WHO - ARMY OF DEATH by Jason Arnopp Page 112\nDOCTOR: SCENE 65: INT. TARDIS (MARY’S ROOM)\nMARY: (FX: JOURNAL SCRIBBLES, CONTINUOUS) Before taking pen to paper in this new journal, I thought about my last entry in the other. I hardly recognise the woman who wrote it — a woman so optimistic about what she and Nia might find in Garrak. It feels as though I have been in a world of illusion where danger and death somehow pass as ‘adventure’. Where it feels exhilarating to evade monsters and evil spirits. It has taken the blackest necromancy of a man like Karnex to awaken me, as if from a distorted dream, confused and shaken.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Mary, sorry to disturb you... but would you like a cup of tea? I’ve some marvellous Oolong I picked up in Peking in 1893. Or was it 1983?\nMARY: The Doctor. What am I to make of him? I believe he has a hypnotic quality. An undeniable charisma which can blind one to the maelstrom which swirls around him. I was too busy falling for his unquestionably good heart — even believing him to be a soulmate — to notice his other travelling companion. The Reaper, constantly grinning by his side.\nMARY: But my mind is now made up. I shall instruct the Doctor to take me to the place, where, for better or worse, I belong. The place where I am merely... (SIGNING) Mary Shelley.\nCRASH IN CLOSING THEME: END\nCRASH IN CLOSING THEME: 112"
