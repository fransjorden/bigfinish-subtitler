It’s coming from down there, it’s... no, wait, it’s behind us! It’s all around us, I can’t tell—\nRACHEL: There! By the steps, just taking shape. Can you see it?\nSAM: It’s them, they’ve come for us! I knew they would.\nRACHEL: You have to get out of sight. We can’t let them see you here. Down there, Sam. Between those fighters. Go! I can handle them.\nRICHTER: (IN MID-CONVERSATION) —saying is that we could be doing far more than we currently are to identify potential—\nKLEIN: You there! Who are you?\nRACHEL: Nope, sorry. Not how it works. You’re the one who set off the intruder alarm. So, you get to do the introductions first.\nKLEIN: (AMUSED) Very well. I am Oberst Klein, in charge of Temporal Affairs for the Galactic Reich. You have heard of our department, I trust?\nRACHEL: Ah. Yes. Sorry, ma’am. Rachel Cooper. I’m a member of the Ground Crew here. A technician. But—\nRICHTER: This is the Moonbase?\nRACHEL: That’s right, sir. Hangar Fourteen. You’ve missed the ramp by, oh, about fifteen metres.\nRICHTER: And the year, Citizen Cooper? It is 2044, yes?\nKLEIN: The one hundredth year of our Golden Age. Where else do you think we would be, Major Richter? Look at those ships! The first to be fitted with Dalek propulsion units. Those ships will expand our Empire beyond this one solar system. They will carry our colours to the stars and beyond.\nRICHTER: I just wanted to be sure we were in the right—\nKLEIN: When you’ve travelled as widely as I have, you develop an instinct about such things. Everything is as it should be.\nRACHEL: Er.. yeah, now about that alarm? You know there’1l be a security detail on its way over here? I could call—\nKLEIN: Good. Then they can inform your Commandant that we have arrived. (WALKING AWAY) And they can take my TARDIS to the Operations Centre.\nKLEIN: (FX: KLEIN AND RICHTER MARCH AWAY; HEAVY DOORS SLIDE OPEN WITH A\nRUMBLE: )\nRACHEL: Yes, ma’am. (TO SELF) No, ma’am. Three bags full, ma’am. So, that was the infamous Elizabeth Klein...\nRACHEL: SCENE 2. MOONBASE RAMP\nRACHEL: (FX: LOTS OF PEOPLE, ACTIVITY, ENGINE NOISES. STAY WITH KLEIN AND\nRICHTER: AS THEY WALK)\nRICHTER: That security detail should have been here to greet us. There is no excuse for complacency.\nKLEIN: (WEARILY) I agree, Major Richter. But you and I might accept our fair share of the blame for that.\nRICHTER: I assume that speech back there was for my benefit, ma’am. All that talk of our glorious Reich. I have not heard such passion from you in a long time.\nKLEIN: I think it is important, sometimes, to reflect on all we have achieved. Without us—\nRICHTER: Without us, Man could not live and work on the surface of the moon. He could not gaze up at the Earth, because there would be no eco-bubble to protect him.\nKLEIN: Without us, those ships would be painted in the colours of our enemies. You and I remember this place as it was. But we are the only ones who do — and maybe that’s the problem.\nRICHTER: Begging your pardon, ma’am, that is not the way to Generalleutnant Tendexter’s office.\nKLEIN: You can deal with the Commandant. I have business to attend to.\nRICHTER: The prisoner. I guessed as much when you brought us to this year again. Is he the reason you seem so... cautious, these days? We have achieved so much, Oberst Klein, but we can do more.\nKLEIN: I’m aware of your feelings on that subject, Major Richter. But one day, you will understand. One day, when you have seen as many versions of this place as I have seen.\nRICHTER: (CALLS AFTER HER) Who is he, Klein? How is it that a mere prisoner has so much of a hold over you? (GIVES UP, TO SELF) Why do you keep bringing us back here?\nRICHTER: SCENE 3. PRISON CELL\nRICHTER: (FX: WATER DRIPPING. THUNK OF HEAVY LOCKS. IRON DOOR SCREECHES OPEN)\nDOCTOR: You’re back, then.\nKLEIN: Yes, Doctor. I’m back.\nKLEIN: SCENE 4. HANGAR\nRACHEL: It’s OK, Sam. They’ve gone now.\nSAM: (RATTLED) I thought they’d never go away. I thought they’d never get that box, that machine, out of here. What time is it? I’m due back on shift at twelve-hundred hours.\nRACHEL: You’ve got time, Sam. It’s OK, you’ve got time.\nSAM: What if they come back? What if they’re watching us now? What was I thinking? I have my cleaning job. I’m one of the lucky ones. So what if other people have more, if they were born with better genes than I was?\nRACHEL: Don’t talk like that.\nSAM: You saw what just happened, Rachel. Temporal Affairs, they were right here, and I can’t afford to—\nRACHEL: They don’t know a thing. It was chance that brought Klein here, that’s all. Stupid, random chance.\nSAM: I must have been mad. We must both have been mad. Nobody gets away with... something like this, with what you’re suggesting. When was the last time? When was the last time you heard of anyone—?\nRACHEL: Because no one has tried.\nSAM: People have tried, they just don’t.. We don’t remember it. You know that. You know how it works, what they can do. You heard how they came for Gustav two weeks ago, and Marc a few weeks before that. They can’t lose, Rachel.\nRACHEL: Believe me, Sam, I know what I’m asking of you. If I could do this alone, I would. But I need you. And you came to me, remember.\nSAM: Even if they don’t suspect us now, they will. They’1ll have time later, all the time in the world, to work it out, and then—\nRACHEL: No. Don’t you see? If they were going to do that — if they were ever going to find out about us — they’d have come for us already. We’re safe. We’re the ones who can’t lose.\nSAM: I’m sorry, I just can’t.. I can’t risk it. I’m a loyal citizen. Loyal to the Reich. Please, Rachel, just... just leave me alone!\nRACHEL: Sam, no!\nRACHEL: SCENE 5. TENDEXTER’S OFFICE\nRICHTER: I’m sure you’ll find the paperwork in order, sir.\nTENDEXTER: I don’t doubt it, Major Richter. One thing I will say for Temporal Affairs is that your paperwork is always immaculate.\nRICHTER: Thank you, sir.\nTENDEXTER: Even if your commandant is apparently too preoccupied to present it to me in person.\nRICHTER: Oberst Klein sends her apologies, but she had to—\nTENDEXTER: I think I can guess where Oberst Klein is. My concern is that this will be — what? — the fourth member of my staff she has taken this year. If she is so keen to see my prisoner, she could just ask.\nRICHTER: If you’d care to examine the seal on that warrant, Sit...\nTENDEXTER: Yes, thank you, Major, I had made that observation.\nRICHTER: Then you can appreciate that this is no trivial matter. This cleaner’s actions could undermine the security of the Reich itself.\nTENDEXTER: And there has been a trial, I see. Or rather, there will be. Or will have been? A trial over which, it appears, I presided myself. Except that, of course, I have no memory of so doing.\nRICHTER: The intentions of the accused are beyond doubt, sir. If we don’t act now, this crime will be committed. This base will be compromised.\nTENDEXTER: (SIGHS) All right, Major Richter, I don’t need to hear the whole speech again. You may make your arrest. Take all the men you need to assist you.\nTENDEXTER: 10\nRICHTER: Thank you, sir.\nTENDEXTER: Well, I can hardly object, can I? I can hardly stand in your way. Not when it appears that I issued these papers myself.\nTENDEXTER: 11\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 6. PRISON CELL\nKLEIN: I have to say, I’m impressed. Disappointed, but impressed. I had thought our interrogators might have softened your resolve by now.\nDOCTOR: Then perhaps your interrogators aren’t as good as you thought they were, Oberst Klein. Or perhaps I have already told them the truth.\nKLEIN: I doubt that. You forget that I know you, Doctor. Oh, I know you don’t recall the adventures we had. You think we met for the first time in this squalid little cell, only a few months ago. But in another timeline, another world, we travelled in the TARDIS together.\nDOCTOR: I think you might have me confused with somebody else. Alone this time, I see?\nKLEIN: A suicide mission? A clumsy attempt to sabotage our reactor core? Oh no, no, Doctor, I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: You have no idea where I came from, this version of me. You think I might have a TARDIS of my own, somewhere on this base. And that worries you, doesn’t it?\nKLEIN: You wouldn’t have come here without an escape route planned.\nDOCTOR: It worries you, because this power you think you wield — it’s worth nothing to you if you don’t wield it alone.\nKLEIN: You know I’m keeping you alive, don’t you? Were it not for me, Tendexter would have had you executed long ago. If you could just open your eyes, if you could see what I’m building here.\nDOCTOR: I can see what you’ve torn down, Klein. You’ve rewritten history again and again until you like what you read.\nKLEIN: And, of course, you would never do such a thing. If it weren’t for you, Doctor, my timeline — the proper timeline — would still be intact.\nKLEIN: A\nDOCTOR: I’1ll have to take your word for that.\nKLEIN: You just won’t accept it, will you? The year is 2044, and a unified Earth government has ended famine and disease, averted wars before they could even begin, repelled invaders from a score of worlds.\nDOCTOR: I can see how it happened, of course. You set out with one goal alone: to restore the timeline from which you came. But my TARDIS wouldn’t let you meet yourself, wouldn’t let you correct the mistake you once made.\nKLEIN: I have used my TARDIS in ways you would never have dared dream. I have become the architect of a better world. A Golden Age.\nDOCTOR: And now, you’re exporting your idea of perfection to the stars. In swastika-patterned spaceships. I thought I was getting through to you, Klein. The last time you were here, with Faber, you seemed—\nKLEIN: (RATTLED) Who... who are you talking about? Faber? I don’t know anyone called Faber.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you? The love of your life? The man you left behind in 1965? Think, Klein. I know it must be hard, sometimes, to know what’s real and what only used to be. Your head, filled with memories of days that never were.\nKLEIN: You never met Faber. And I.. I never told you about him. Not this version of you. How could you...?\nDOCTOR: You’ve been travelling in time long enough now, Klein. Long enough to begin to see how its fragile strands are spun. Punch through them as you have been doing, and you risk bringing the whole web down.\nKLEIN: You would say anything, do anything, to get your own way. But you had your chance, Doctor. You’ve had your time. It’s over. I don’t think you do have a plan, after all — else why would you have spent six months in chains?\nDOCTOR: What’s the point in escaping? You’d only go back in time and stop me, and I wouldn’t even remember it.\nDOCTOR: ile\nKLEIN: So, to answer one of your questions: no, Doctor, you don’t worry me. But I will grant you this much: This is not the world, the timeline, I set out to restore all those years ago. It is a better one by far.\nKLEIN: 14\nKLEIN: SCENE 7. REFECTORY\nKLEIN: (FX: SMALL CROWD, CLINKING OF CUTLERY. DOOR CRASHES OPEN, SOLDIERS\nMARCH: IN, HALT)\nRICHTER: I will have silence, please. (FX: ACTIVITY BEGINS TO SUBSIDE) (YELLS) Silence! (FX: ACTIVITY CEASES) You! Where do you think you're going?\nSAM: I was taking these plates to the kitchen, sir. My duties—\nRICHTER: I commend you on your diligence, Citizen. But I’m sure you would not wish me to think you were sneaking away, that you had something to hide?\nSAM: No. No, sir. Nothing to hide. I am loyal to the Reich, I swear. And I always will be. In the future, I mean.\nRICHTER: In the future. Of course. (TO ALL) Major Richter, Temporal Affairs. (FX: DISCONCERTED MURMURS) I am here to execute an arrest warrant. As, it seems, one among you has deduced already.\nSAM: No, sir. I mean, yes sir. I mean, I’ve never seen you before. But your uniform insignia, that blue flash...\nRICHTER: (TO ALL) You all know the principles upon which our society is built. We must stand united against the outsiders that would divide and destroy us. Sadly, some of us lack the strength of will to maintain that unity. Our intentions may be good, but our genes are weak. I want you to search your hearts, Citizens. Search your hearts, and be honest about what you find there - because, as your comrade here has so rightly surmised, I have seen the future. And I know that somebody in this room will betray us.\nSAM: I.. I don’t understand. Why are you giving me this...?\nRICHTER: (SARCASTICALLY) Because you are a good and loyal Citizen. So, I know I can trust you to read out the name on these papers — and identify the traitor in question to me.\nRICHTER: 15\nRICHTER: SCENE 8. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nRICHTER: (FX: ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE PRESENT, SOME ACTIVITY. MACHINERY HUMS AND CLICKS, RADAR PINGS. DOORS OPEN AND FOOTSTEPS )\nTENDEXTER: All right, Feldwebel, I’m here. What’s the problem?\nFELDWEBEL: The tactical screen, sir. Those signatures. A moment ago, they weren’t there, I swear. I just don’t see how—\nTENDEXTER: Let me see that... No. That can’t be. It’s impossible. It must be a malfunction. Didn’t you think to run a diagnostic before you disturbed me?\nFELDWEBEL: I did that, sir. The computer confirms it. There are six ships out there. Less than two light minutes away, and closing fast.\nTENDEXTER: Then they’re already in... (FX: FRANTIC PRESSING OF SWITCHES) Why weren’t we warned? What’s the point of having a network of satellites if they don’t..? Didn’t we get a warning from the satellites?\nFELDWEBEL: Nothing, sir. As I said, the ships appeared from nowhere.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Diagnostic. Sensor systems functioning normally. Satellite network online and reporting no problems. End diagnostic.\nFELDWEBEL: I could try to contact them.\nTENDEXTER: Yes. No. I want our fighters scrambled. ‘A’ Flight. I want visual confirmation. And I want to know how this happened. Our satellites.. Nothing should be able to enter this solar system without our knowing about it.\nFELDWEBEL: Should we put the Moonbase on alert, sir?\nTENDEXTER: Yes. Yes, do that. And Klein! Her time machine is still here, she must be on the base. Get me Oberst Klein. At once.\nTENDEXTER: 16\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Announcement. This installation is now on full alert. All operational personnel are to report to emergency positions. Repeat, this installation is now on full alert. End announcement.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Ai\nCOMPUTER VOICE: SCENE 9. CORRIDOR\nRACHEL: What made you change your mind?\nSAM: That major. Klein’s stunted sidekick. He was in the refectory. I thought... His eyes were boring right through me. But it wasn’t me he wanted. It was Karen... Karen Montoya. She was so scared.\nRACHEL: I don’t think I know her.\nSAM: She just transferred from the Twilight Shift. Keeps herself to herself, works hard, but always seemed unhappy. She wanted to start a family, but she couldn’t get a permit. Maybe she just... I mean, one day she might have...\nRACHEL: What did they do?\nSAM: Marched her out of there. Told us to forget we ever knew her. Left us afraid to think the wrong thoughts. The same as they always do.\nRACHEL: We can stop this, Sam. We can stop this today. But we have to act fast. Here.\nSAM: What... what is this thing? It looks like a.. listening device.\nRACHEL: It’s probably best if I don’t explain. But I need you to plant this on the TARDIS... on Klein’s time machine. It’1ll be in Operations. I don’t have the clearance to get in there, but you...\nSAM: I’m rostered on there this afternoon. You mean...? I didn’t expect it to be so soon. Rachel...\nRACHEL: I know, Sam, and I’m sorry. But you hear that siren? We’re out of time. If only I could see the future myself. If I’d known this morning that Klein and Richter were going to appear right in front of me...\nSAM: No. No, it’s OK. In fact, it’s better this way. Because I’ve made up my mind, and that means... Well, the sooner, the better. Get it over with. Until we do, I’1ll always be waiting...\nSAM: 18\nRACHEL: You just place that device on the time machine, Sam. That’s all\nRACHEL: you have to do. But you have to do it this afternoon. It has to be now.\nRACHEL: 19\nRACHEL: SCENE 10. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nKLEIN: You should have told me about this, Tendexter. Why didn’t I know about this?\nTENDEXTER: I don’t know what you mean, Oberst Klein. I sent for you as soon as I-\nKLEIN: I mean, the last time we met. Four years from now.\nTENDEXTER: You think I’d keep something like this from you? Six unidentified craft within striking distance of Earth... This is exactly the sort of thing your department exists to prevent.\nRICHTER: Indeed. And yet, we did not know this was coming. There was no report.\nTENDEXTER: Well... then, maybe it will turn out to be nothing after all. An equipment malfunction, as I first thought. We’1ll soon know. I’ve scrambled eight fighters. They should be nearing—\nKLEIN: Just eight?\nTENDEXTER: We had twelve on standby, of course, but four of them.. Some manner of blockage at Hangar Fourteen. We’ve sounded the alert. Every ship on this base will be battle ready within six minutes.\nRICHTER: Excuse me a moment. (FX: A COUPLE OF STEPS) Citizen Kirke, is it not?\nSAM: Yes, sir. Sam Kirke, sir. I.. I clean in here three times a week. I could come back later, if you’d rather?\nRICHTER: No, no, you go about your business. (SUSPICIOUS) You must have your Commandant’s trust, after all, to be working in his Operations Centre.\nFELDWEBEL: We’re getting pictures, sir, from Eagle One-Niner. Putting them on screen.\nFELDWEBEL: 20\nKLEIN: And there is the first of our enemy ships. Recognise the design, Major Richter?\nTENDEXTER: It’s so... so black. That fin on its back, and that decal on its front. Like teeth. It looks like a...\nRICHTER: A shark, Generalleutnant Tendexter. It looks like a shark.\nTENDEXTER: So, this is an attack. But how is that possible? How could they have...? And why didn’t you see it? In the future?\nKLEIN: All very good questions, Tendexter. And I suspect that only one man knows the answers. (FX: WALKING AWAY) Major Richter, you will prepare the TARDIS for departure. I will join you shortly.\nKLEIN: 21\nKLEIN: SCENE 11. PRISON CELL\nDOCTOR: Back so soon, Klein? I would offer you a cup of tea, perhaps a chocolate hobnob, but as you can see...\nKLEIN: I’m not here to make small talk with you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What a shame. I thought we could reminisce again, about old times that never happened.\nKLEIN: Not this time. This time, I want to talk about the Selachians.\nDOCTOR: Selachians?\nKLEIN: Don’t play the innocent with me. In their time, the Selachians were the scourge of their galaxy. It took me months, and many trips in the TARDIS, to keep them from conquering this one too. But this is 2044 — and in 2044, the Selachians had not yet built their armoured suits, let alone developed space travel. So tell me, Doctor... what did you do?\nKLEIN: 22\nKLEIN: SCENE 12. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nTENDEXTER: Major Richter, you can’t just leave.\nRICHTER: You heard Oberst Klein. I have to prepare the TARDIS for—\nTENDEXTER: Please, can’t you help us? Those creatures... If they’re from the future, you must know something—\nRICHTER: Selachians, Generalleutnant. They’re called Selachians. Walking, armoured sharks. Ruthless, paranoid and totally without pity.\nTENDEXTER: But... but why are they here? What do they want? Maybe, if we knew that, we could negotiate with them.\nRICHTER: What the Selachians want, sir, is to destroy you. You can attempt to negotiate with them if you wish. I wouldn’t give you much for your chances.\nFELDWEBEL: It’s the aliens, sir. They’re acknowledging our transmission.\nTENDEXTER: Take that call. Put it on the screen here. No, belay that. Major Richter, you know these creatures, perhaps you could— Richter! (FX: TARDIS DOOR SLAMS) (SIGHS) All right, you just hide in your little blue box while I.. (TO FELDWEBEL) I’11l talk to them now. To the aliens.\nFELDWEBEL: Patching them through, sir.\nTENDEXTER: I am Generalleutnant Adolph Tendexter, representing the Terran Galactic Reich. Your ships have violated our space, and I insist—\nSELACHIAN LEADER: (FX: OVER RADIO) I do not care about your name or your rank. You are nothing but plankton to be ground beneath the heel of the Selachian Empire. Your primitive ships are no match for our warcraft. You have ten minutes to surrender — or else we will destroy you.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: 23\nSELACHIAN LEADER: SCENE 13. CORRIDOR\nSAM: (CALLS) Rachel! Rachel!\nRACHEL: Sam! You’re supposed to be in Operations.\nSAM: Everyone was so busy. I slipped away. I had to find you, had to talk.\nRACHEL: Did you do it, Sam? Did you plant the device on Klein’s TARDIS?\nSAM: I think so. But Richter was there. He almost saw me. I didn’t have time to make sure it had stuck, but I think it did. Rachel, there are ships out there. Outsiders!\nRACHEL: (TO SELF) It has to work. We can’t have gone through all this for nothing.\nSAM: Did you hear what I said? The Moonbase, it’s under attack! And Klein... What if Klein was the only hope we had? What if we’ve.. What if we need her, after all? Maybe we should—\nRACHEL: No, Sam. You did the right thing. I wish I had time to explain it to you, but we.. It’s best if we aren’t seen together.\nSAM: I never thought this would be me, you know. Before we met. I never thought I’d be a rebel. I knew my place. I did as I was told.\nRACHEL: I.. I was the opposite. I used to dream that Temporal Affairs would come for me, and I’d have to go on the run and join a resistance group. And then, one day, it was my twenty-first birthday, and I realised something. I realised they weren’t coming. I was never going to be important, never going to make a difference.\nSAM: Thank you, Rachel. Whatever comes of this.. Thank you, for showing me who I can be.\nRACHEL: What... what will you do? Where will you go?\nRACHEL: 24\nSAM: Back to my old life. Back to my work, my cleaning. They won’t have missed me yet. And if they have... I’11 tell them I was afraid, that I ran. They won’t execute me for that. It’ll just be a few weeks in confinement.\nRACHEL: I shouldn’t do this. I’m supposed to leave you behind, that was the plan, but I can’t just.. Come on, Sam. Quick, before I come to my senses!\nSAM: What...? What are you..? Where are you going?\nRACHEL: (CALLS) You’re coming with me, Sam Kirke! Come on!\nRACHEL: 25\nRACHEL: SCENE 14. PRISON CELL\nKLEIN: Don’t lie to me, Doctor. I see your hand in this. Or... or that of your people. I demand to know the truth!\nDOCTOR: You claim to know me, Klein. Then you ought to know how I respond to demands.\nKLEIN: Why are the Selachians here? In this time period?\nDOCTOR: I really have no idea. But surely your Galactic Reich can defend itself against a few little monsters?\nKLEIN: Of course it can. Our defences are decades ahead of their time. Our fighter ships are equipped with the finest weaponry of three galaxies.\nDOCTOR: And should they fail, you’1l just rub out the history books again. Start over. Only you can never quite get it right, can you? There’s always something more to be fixed, some new threat to counter. They just can’t seem to get along without your help.\nKLEIN: That... that has been a concern of mine. But that’s why others have been trained to continue my work. So long as we have the TARDIS—\nDOCTOR: Others such as Faber. Whatever happened to him, Klein? Faber was important to you once. More important than any of this. You were a different person with him.\nKLEIN: (RATTLED) This.. this is serious, Doctor. The Selachians have time travel.\nDOCTOR: So, what’s to stop them from doing to you what you did to them? What you’ve been doing to the rest of the universe?\nKLEIN: (PULLS HERSELF TOGETHER) Very well then, keep your silence. I’m leaving now. I will see for myself the outcome of this attack, and I will learn how best to pre-empt it. When next we meet, you will have no memory of this conversation. But I will take great pleasure in explaining to you just how your oh-so-clever scheme has been thwarted.\nKLEIN: 26\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) So, another strand breaks.\nDOCTOR: 27\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nTENDEXTER: Oberst Klein, thank goodness you’re back. The Selachians—\nKLEIN: (BRUSQUELY, MARCHING PAST HIM) Put it in your report, Generalleutnant Tendexter. If you survive to file one. I’1ll read it in the future.\nTENDEXTER: You can’t leave us now, we need you! We... we don’t know what to do. You’re supposed to tell us what to do.\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) Must we go through this again? It’s always the same. Against the Sontarans, against the Daleks... If I had a hundred marks for every time I’ve seen you, or somebody like you, break under the pressure...\nTENDEXTER: I don’t know what you mean. I was decorated for my part in the Dalek War.\nKLEIN: In this timeline, perhaps so. This timeline, in which I was here to warn you of your mistakes, one by one, before you could make them. Don’t crow to me about your war record, Generalleutnant. The man standing in front of me now has never fought a war that wasn’t already won.\nTENDEXTER: And I suppose this — we — are just one more mistake to you? One more of your ‘timelines’ to abandon as you please? Well, I won’t have it, Klein. As your superior officer, I am ordering you to—\nKLEIN: You can’t order me to do anything, Tendexter. Where matters of the future are concerned, my department has jurisdiction. Continue to stand in my way, and I will have you charged with treason.\nTENDEXTER: But what about us? What happens to us if you alter the past? Do we just.. just cease to exist? How will that happen? What will it feel like?\nTENDEXTER: 28\nKLEIN: I don’t know, and I care less. But think of it this way. Perhaps will reach the future to learn that you dealt with this incident all by yourself, that my assistance was not required. Somehow, though, I doubt it. (FX: TARDIS DOOR OPENS) Goodbye, Generalleutnant Tendexter. I would wish you good luck — but frankly, it doesn’t matter a jot what you do now.\nTENDEXTER: Damn you, Klein, you can’t do this to us. (FX: BANGS ON TARDIS) Come out of that box. I order you to come out of that box!\nTENDEXTER: 29\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 16.

The TARDIS... Something has happened to it. Please, don’t make this any harder for us all than it has to be.\nDOCTOR: Any harder? I take it, Klein, you have some rational reason for believing I’1ll agree to help you?\nKLEIN: You’1l help me, Doctor, because you don’t like the Selachians any more than I do.\nDOCTOR: A disagreeable race, I’1ll grant you. Of course, you could also choose to see them as a product of an abused history. And a few minutes ago, you thought I was in league with them. What changed your mind?\nKLEIN: I need the TARDIS. Without it, we’re defenceless. Earth will fall to those monsters. The whole of Time itself will fall to them. And I’m sure that was never a part of your plan. Even you couldn’t be SO... SO...\nDOCTOR: (CALMLY) Ruthless? Is that what you think, Klein? Selachians, Nazis.. suppose I don’t care which of them wins this war? Suppose I don’t see all that much of a difference between you?\nDOCTOR: 34\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20. MOONBASE RAMP\nDOCTOR: (FX: ATMOS AS BEFORE, BUT ACTIVITY MORE FRENZIED. SAM AND RACHEL\nRUN: TOWARDS US, STOP)\nSAM: We’ll never get across the ramp. There are too many people!\nRACHEL: Of course there are. Tendexter put the base on full alert. Everyone who’s anyone is out here now. And that’s why no one will stop to question us. Come on, Sam, we can do this!\nRICHTER: Bad luck, Citizen... Cooper, wasn’t it? You’ve found the one man who does wish to ask you and your comrade here a few questions.\nSAM: Major Richter! I thought you’d.. I mean, this.. this isn’t what it looks like. Rachel and I, we were just... we... we're...\nRICHTER: You are ‘loyal to the Reich’. I know that, Citizen Kirke. That is why you will spare a moment of your time to assist me.\nRACHEL: That, and the plasma pistol you’re sporting. Nice piece of kit, Sir.\nRICHTER: A posting to Temporal Affairs has its, shall we say, fringe benefits.\nRACHEL: Look, Major, I’m at fault here. I took Sam from his duties. I didn’t think anyone would mind. Hangar Fourteen. We need the fighters that are blocked in there. Sam said he’d help me clear the doors.\nRICHTER: Did he also mention this little gadget?\nRACHEL: A listening device?\nRICHTER: I think you know better. I have been to the future, Citizen Cooper. I have been to alien worlds. I have seen their technology, used it — and yet, I have never seen anything like this.\nRICHTER: 39\nRACHEL: So, you’re looking for a techie to give it the once-over. I’11 do what I can, but you should probably take this to the boffins in the Vault.\nRICHTER: I know what the device does. I have seen it in action. What I wish to know is, who attached it to my time machine? And then I remembered that you, Citizen Cooper, were alone with the TARDIS this morning — and that you, Citizen Kirke, were skulking about the Operations Centre.\nRACHEL: Then you saw us together, and you thought... what? That we’re trying to escape? Where would we go?\nSAM: It’s like Rachel said, Hangar Fourteen...\nRICHTER: We will discuss this further with Oberst Klein and Generalleutnant Tendexter. (FX: COCKS GUN) Both of you, march!\nRICHTER: 36\nRICHTER: SCENE 21. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nRICHTER: (FX: ACTIVITY MORE FRENETIC THAN BEFORE, LOTS OF RUNNING ABOUT,\nFELDWEBEL: OPERATING CONTROLS FRANTICALLY )\nFELDWEBEL: Eagle One-Niner down, sir. The pilot bailed out, but he’s drifting in space. Eagles Three and Two-Four report they can’t reach him.\nTENDEXTER: Tell them to press the attack. A pilot is no good to us without his ship. How are they doing this, Feldwebel? The technology on board those fighters... (ANGRY, FRUSTRATED) They told us this couldn’t happen!\nFELDWEBEL: Another hit. Eagle One-Two, reporting the loss of port engines. Attempting to stabilise.. Eagle Six down, sir! Eagle Six down!\nTENDEXTER: What’s happening out there, Feldwebel? We have the firepower, the numbers... Why aren’t we hurting them?\nFELDWEBEL: Eagle Two-Four reports a direct hit on the Selachian flagship, sir, but.. but no sign of damage. Hostiles returning fire.\nTENDEXTER: Damn it, we need more ships up there. Where are those reinforcements?\nFELDWEBEL: ‘B’ Flight is off the ground, moving to engage. ‘C’ Flight... Sir, one of the Selachian ships, it... it’s broken formation. It’s coming towards us!\nTENDEXTER: A bombing run? They... they’d have to be insane. Our shields... I want the whole of ‘B’ Flight between them and us. They’re to bring that ship down, whatever it takes. Do you hear me, Feldwebel? Whatever it takes!\nTENDEXTER: 37\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 22. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: It’s as I thought. The interior dimension of the TARDIS has been torn loose from the exterior. The damage is irreversible.\nKLEIN: I refuse to accept that. There must be something you can do. There must be some way you can fix it.\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing to fix. It’s gone, Klein. Nothing can bring it back. (TO SELF) But the weapon that could do that... It doesn’t exist, even in the Selachians’ time. There’s only one place I’ve seen such a weapon...\nKLEIN: We can carry out the post-mortem later. What now?\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) They would have triggered it from space. But they’d have needed somebody down here too.\nKLEIN: Did you hear me, Doctor? I asked you, what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: I’m open to suggestions.\nKLEIN: It’s time we stopped playing games. Time for the truth. I know you have a way out of here. You have to take me to it, for the sake of—\nDOCTOR: Do we have to go through this again, Klein? Even if I had another TARDIS, even if I knew where it was, do you think I would let you of all people through its doors? After what you did last time?\nKLEIN: You remember—?\nDOCTOR: Escaping from Colditz, the Chaelis in Kenya, the hatching yards of the Vrill. Of course I remember.\nKLEIN: But that timeline no longer exists! How could you—?\nKLEIN: 38\nDOCTOR: I’m a Time Lord, Klein. With a lifetime’s worth of exposure to the Vortex. Seven lifetimes’ worth. You might have rewritten those lifetimes, placed me in a universe I don’t recognise — but you couldn’t take my mind.\nKLEIN: You mean you don’t...? You really don’t know how you came to be here?\nDOCTOR: I remember my past. That’s what I held on to. I remember my TARDIS disappearing, stranding me. Then Time, reshaping itself around me, over and over. Then I was here. In this world. In that prison cell. Just three days ago. As for what my rewritten self might have been up to before I arrived, before my consciousness replaced his.. I’m as much in the dark as you are.\nKLEIN: Now what...?\nDOCTOR: It sounds as if the Selachians have begun their attack. Terrifying, isn’t it? To know that there’s no going back this time, that whatever happens now you have to live with the consequences.\nKLEIN: Where do you think you’re going? Your cell, Doctor, is this way.\nDOCTOR: But the Operations Centre, I believe, is this way. And that’s where we need to be now, Klein — to face the Selachians. To deal with your problems in the here and now.\nDOCTOR: 39\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23. MOONBASE RAMP\nDOCTOR: (FX: RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE BOMBING NOW, PEOPLE SCREAMING, RUNNING. A WIND INCREASES IN VOLUME AND STRENGTH THROUGHOUT THE SCENE )\nRACHEL: (CRIES) This way, Sam. Back to the base! Run!\nRICHTER: (CRIES) Do not take another step! You are still my prisoners, and I will—\nRACHEL: You'll do what? You’1l shoot us? Don’t you see, Richter? Can’t you feel that wind? Those bombs have punctured the eco-bubble.\nSAM: (CRIES) We.. we’re losing air.\nRACHEL: It’s worse than that. If that bubble collapses, we’1ll all be blown out into space. We’ve got to get under cover.\nSAM: Rachel, watch out!\nRICHTER: The hangar. We’ll be safe in there. Go on, both of you, that’s an\nRICHTER: order!\nRICHTER: 40\nRICHTER: SCENE 24. HANGAR\nRICHTER: (FX: ATMOS AS IN SCENE 1. LOTS OF SCREAMING, IN MID-DISTANCE.\nTHREE: SETS OF FOOTSTEPS RUN IN. A STRONG WIND BLOWS. RUMBLE OF\nHANGAR: DOORS CLOSING)\nRACHEL: (BREATHLESS) Richter, what are you doing? No, you can’t just—\nRICHTER: (BREATHLESS) I am saving three lives! Now take your hands off the door control, or I will drop that figure by one.\nSAM: (BREATHLESS) But the people out there! Our friends!\nRICHTER: It is too late for them. There is no air outside of this hangar. If I hadn’t closed the doors when I did, there’d be no air left inside it either.\nRACHEL: You could have given them a chance. A few more seconds, at least.\nRICHTER: We should count our blessings that we don’t share their fate. And perhaps, Citizen Cooper, we may also spare a thought for the saboteurs who planted this device on my time machine, because—\nRACHEL: That again? Really? That’s how you want to spend your final minutes in this world? Conducting a witch hunt?\nRICHTER: Because, had it not been for those saboteurs, nobody would have had to die today. Temporal Affairs would have prevented this disaster!\nSAM: What... what do you mean? What are you saying, ‘final minutes’?\nRACHEL: I’m sorry, Sam. I wouldn’t count those ‘blessings’ just yet. Like the man said, there’s no oxygen out there. And no means of generating it in here. We’re cut off from the main building.\nSAM: They’1l restore the eco-bubble, though. Or send someone for us. They won’t leave us trapped here! Is it me, or.. or is the air already starting to feel a bit thin?\nSAM: 41\nRACHEL: So, how about you, Major Richter? Want to take a look around, see if we can find a nice bright light for you to shine in our eyes? Maybe some thumbscrews? Or do you think that maybe — just maybe — we can concentrate on finding a way out of this mess?\nRICHTER: I don’t work with traitors, Citizen Cooper. And the more I hear from you, the more convinced I become that a traitor is what you are. So, I will conduct my ‘witch hunt’ as you call it. I will get to the truth. Because, if nothing else, what little air remains in this hangar will last three times as long with only one pair of lungs to breathe it.\nRICHTER: 42\nRICHTER: SCENE 25. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Warning. Eco-bubble compromised. Ramp exposed to vacuum. Emergency procedures instigated. All exits sealing. Moonbase now in lockdown. End warning.\nFELDWEBEL: (SHELLSHOCKED) Reports are starting to come in, sir. Casualties in the scores... in the hundreds. Anyone who was still out there...\nTENDEXTER: While the rest of us are sealed inside this building. Sitting ducks.\nFELDWEBEL: ‘B’ Flight was off the ground, sir, but ‘C’ and '‘D’.. Trying to contact our fighters now. (FX: CONTROLS) No response from Eagle Four-Three. No response from Eagle Eight-Five. No response from Eagle Six-One.\nTENDEXTER: Don’t waste your breath, Feldwebel. Auto-distress signals lighting up the board. We’ve lost Hangars Four, Six, Eleven and Fifteen. Klein was right. She was right about me. But.. but how could I have stopped this?\nDOCTOR: Wrong question, Generalleutnant Tendexter. What you need to be asking is, how do we stop it now? Excuse me, I need to get to those controls.\nTENDEXTER: What the...? Oberst Klein! What is the meaning of—?\nKLEIN: (RESIGNED) I don’t like it any more than you do, Generalleutnant, but—\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I’m sure I’m breaking every rule and regulation in the book. Because there’s always a book, somewhere. Put your finger on that button, would you, Klein? Now hold it there while I... (TAILS OFF, DISTRACTED)\nKLEIN: You had your sonic screwdriver with you all along? How on earth...?\nKLEIN: 43\nFELDWEBEL: Incoming signals, sir. Ten of them.\nTENDEXTER: I’ve told you, Feldwebel, I have no wish to speak with—\nFELDWEBEL: No, sir, these aren’t comms signals. They’re too broad, compressed with algorithms the computer can’t decode. I don’t know what they are. —=.\nDOCTOR: Transmat beams. They’re transmat beams. There are ten Selachians, attempting to materialise in this room. And the only reason they haven’t succeeded yet is because I’m oscillating the output frequency of the Moonbase’s reactor core—\nKLEIN: —to interfere with their recombination matrices. That’s ingenious, Doctor! But you’re utilising most of the core’s capacity to do it. And the transmat beams are increasing in strength. How long—?\nDOCTOR: About another ten seconds. (FX: BARRAGE OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS) On second thoughts, make that five.\nTENDEXTER: You mean you can’t... You can’t stop them? We have to get out of here! Evacuate! Regroup in... I don’t know... in the...\nDOCTOR: No time for that, Generalleutnant. They’re here.\nDOCTOR: (FX: INBOUND TRANSMAT — LIKE A SUDDEN, FIERCE INRUSH OF AIR? BUT\nKEEP: THAT SOUND GOING AS PEOPLE PANIC, CRY OUT)\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: In the name of the glorious Selachian Empire, I lay claim to this—\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: (FX: SELACHIAN LEADER CUT OFF IN MID-WORD AS TRANSMAT SOUND REVERSES TO A DEFINITE PERCUSSIVE END)\nDOCTOR: And now they’re gone. For a short time, at least. I couldn’t block\nDOCTOR: the beams outright, so I had to settle for deflecting them.\nKLEIN: To where? Back to their ships? Out into space?\nDOCTOR: Not quite so far, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: 44\nDOCTOR: SCENE 26. HANGAR\nDOCTOR: (FX: IN MID-DISTANCE: AN INBOUND TRANSMAT. CLOSER: THREE PEOPLE\nRUN: FOR COVER, HALT)\nSAM: (HUSHED) What... What’s happening? What is that thing? It just... it just appeared from nowhere!\nRICHTER: (HUSHED) Don’t you recognise it, Citizen Kirke? Have you really not seen your alien masters before?\nRACHEL: (HUSHED) You’re just choked because its gun is so much bigger than yours.\nRACHEL: (FX: IN MID-DISTANCE: METAL FOOTSTEPS ON STONE, ALSO THE SLOSHING OF WATER INSIDE A SELACHIAN’S ARMOUR)\nSAM: It hasn’t seen us yet. Maybe if we’re quiet, it’1ll think there’s nobody in here. Maybe it’1ll just... leave.\nRACHEL: It looks like a shark. An armoured shark. What do you think, Richter? Aquatic? Is that water I can hear in its suit?\nRICHTER: We’ll see soon enough. I’m going to riddle that monster with—\nSAM: No, you can’t shoot! Its armour will... I mean, what if its armour is too strong for your bullets?\nRICHTER: This pistol, Citizen Kirke, was developed by the finest weapon- smiths of the thirty-first century. I hardly think—\nRACHEL: We don’t have much choice. You were right about that thing leaving us alone, Sam. It’s headed for the doors. And the bad news is?\nSAM: It’s headed for the doors! But there’s no air out there!\nRICHTER: (YELLS) Hey! Come back and face us, you fish-faced freak!\nRACHEL: (NORMAL VOICE) OK. So, now who’s thinking that asphyxiation might not have been such a bad way to go?\nRACHEL: 45\nSELACHIAN: Human plankton! You will pay for your assault upon a Selachian trooper. Surrender and face your deaths with some honour, or be shot down like cowards. Either way, you will die today!\nSELACHIAN: (FX: RACHEL AND SAM RUN. THE SELACHIAN FIRES, A REAL ‘WHUMPH’ OF ENERGY, ITS GUN OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN RICHTER’S)\nSELACHIAN: 46\nSELACHIAN: SCENE 27. CORRIDOR\nCOOK: (GAGGING AND GASPING AS HE’S STRANGLED) Please, please I’ve done nothing to you.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: Cease your snivelling, plankton. All surface creatures bear the guilt of your crimes against our kind.\nCOOK: But I’m only a cook. You can tell by the colour of my eyes, I can’t be a leader. I was just looking for a place to hide. You’re choking me!\nSELACHTAN LEADER: I will do worse than that if you don’t direct me toward these leaders of yours. Where is Generalleutant Tendexter?\nCOOK: Operations. The Operations Centre. He’1ll be in there, or... or his office is just off it. Straight down that corridor, third on the left.\nSELACHTAN LEADER: And they tell me that human beings have spines.\nSELACHIAN: Leader. What is this place? How were we separated?\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: Our transmat beams were thrown off-course. Evidently, the Terrans of this age are more advanced than we were given to believe. Even so, they are no match for our technology. We have breached their facility as planned.\nSELACHIAN: We should have been warned. Our agent among the humans—\nSELACHTAN LEADER: There will be a reckoning for that later. For now... (FX: ELECTRONIC\nBLEEP: AS HE ACTIVATES A COMMUNICATOR) All troopers will converge on the area designated ‘the Operations Centre’ — bearing oh-nine- five, distance approximately oh-point-three-five-four kilometres from my Signal. Should any surface creatures cross your path... eliminate them!\nBLEEP: 47\nBLEEP: SCENE 28. HANGAR\nBLEEP: (FX: SELACHIAN STOMPS FORWARD, SHOOTING. RICHTER RETURNS FIRE; WE’RE WITH RACHEL AND SAM AS THEY RUN FROM THE BATTLE)\nSAM: (BREATHLESS) What’s the point in running? Rachel, there’s nowhere to run to!\nRACHEL: (BREATHLESS) We need time to think. Richter may be a thug, but he’s a highly trained thug. If he can buy us a few more minutes—\nSAM: You were saying? He’s dead, Rachel. Major Richter is dead — and we’re next!\nRACHEL: (HUSHED) Get down here, Sam! I don’t think the Selachian saw which way we went. Look, it’s just standing there, guarding the doors. It doesn’t know we can’t get out that way, anyway.\nSELACHIAN: (CALLS FROM DISTANCE) There is no escape for you, humans. The longer you hide from me, the more painful I will make your inevitable deaths.\nRACHEL: It’s trying to intimidate us. That’s what these things do, I’m guessing. That’s what the shark motif’s all about. Don’t fall for it, Sam.\nSAM: (HUSHED) Rachel, I.. I’m sorry, but I think I have to—\nRACHEL: A rivet gun! Well done, Sam! I don’t suppose it’1ll do us much good, but it’s something. Um.. you do know you’re pointing that thing right at me?\nSAM: (FRUSTRATED, ALMOST TOO LOUD) Please, Rachel, just listen! I... I don’t want to do this, but I-—\nRACHEL: OK. It’s OK, Sam. I know what this is. It’s about what Richter said — about that device I gave you being from the future. But I Swear to you, he was wrong about me. Trust me, if that monster over there finds us, it is not going to greet me with a big hug.\nRACHEL: 48\nSAM: What... What if we gave ourselves up? We never fired on the Selachian, that was Richter. We aren’t even armed. It might—\nRACHEL: No. No, that’s not an option. Remember what I told you about when I was younger? About wanting to make a difference, but knowing it couldn’t happen? I met someone, Sam. Someone who gave me a second chance at life. Someone who showed me that there’s always hope.\nSAM: Then... you are a spy. You’re working undercover.\nRACHEL: But not for the Selachians, Sam. I’m working for a friend of mine. My best friend. The Doctor.\nRACHEL: 49\nRACHEL: SCENE 29. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nTENDEXTER: Is that them, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Non-human life signs. Ten of them, scattered across the base. Yes, Generalleutnant, I’d say that was them.\nKLEIN: You really didn’t send them far, did you?\nDOCTOR: And they appear to know the way back, too. Converging on this room.. All apart from this one, here in... where is that?\nTENDEXTER: Hangar Two. You’ve bought us some time, at least. If the Selachians want to get in here now, they’1ll have to blast their way through the emergency bulkheads — twenty centimetres of Dalekenium-laced steel.\nDOCTOR: And don’t imagine they can’t. Or won’t. (FX: MUFFLED BLAST OF\nSELACHIAN: GUN) It seems the first of our ‘guests’ has arrived already.\nSELACHIAN: (FX: ANOTHER BLAST. REPEAT AT REGULAR INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THIS SCENE )\nKLEIN: This is your fault, Doctor. We should have done as I said, looked for your.. your alternative self’s TARDIS, and escaped in that. But no, you had to stay and face your ‘consequences’.\nDOCTOR: You're talking as if we’re defeated, Klein. Correct me if I’m wrong, but neither of us is dead yet.\nTENDEXTER: Two Selachians out there now. The bulkhead is holding, but the computer estimates it will fail in... (FX: CONTROLS) in approximately fourteen minutes. That’s if no more of those things turn up!\nKLEIN: Doctor, take a look at this.\nKLEIN: 50\nDOCTOR: The operating protocols for the reactor core. Very interesting, Klein, but I’ve already—\nKLEIN: Don’t you see? That core outputs more energy than all the fighter ships on this base combined. It’s the greatest weapon we have! And you.. You, Doctor, bypassed all the safety shut-outs in about a minute flat, found a back door in. What I’m saying is, you could—\nDOCTOR: No, Klein. There’s a reason those safeguards existed in the first place. Scrambling a few transmat beams was risky enough, but this...\nTENDEXTER: What? What could he do?\nKLEIN: The Doctor could trigger a reactor core backlash. He could send a microwave pulse right through the Moonbase. We’d be safe in here — the bulkheads would protect us. The Selachians would boil in their water-filled armour!\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t expect you to respect the sanctity of alien life, Klein. But your own people are out there. You saw what your monitors said. One hundred and sixteen survivors.\nTENDEXTER: A hundred and twelve now. The Selachians are slaughtering them. If we don’t do something soon, they’1ll kill us all! Can you do what Klein says?\nDOCTOR: I won’t commit mass murder for you.\nTENDEXTER: I didn’t ask if you would do it, Doctor. I asked if you could.\nKLEIN: He’s done the hard work already. I could probably trigger the backlash myself, if I had more time.\nDOCTOR: And you’d do it, too, wouldn’t you? Without hesitation. Without\nDOCTOR: remorse.\nTENDEXTER: I’m not hearing a better idea from you.\nTENDEXTER: 51\nDOCTOR: I don’t think too well with a gun to my head. But then, you don’t appear to be thinking too clearly either, Generalleutnant Tendexter. What happens after you pull that trigger? Who’1l save you then?\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) Put the gun down, Tendexter. One thing I have learned about the Doctor is that you won’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do.\nDOCTOR: Why, thank you, Klein.\nKLEIN: (TO ALL) Look at this man, all of you. This man could save our lives, but he chooses not to. It’s against his principles! (FX:\nUNCERTAIN: MURMURS FROM TWENTY OR SO PEOPLE) (TO DOCTOR) Well, good for you, Doctor. Now, at least you can die with a smug look on your face.\nDOCTOR: Alternatively, I could live. We could all live. Everybody on this base, both inside this room and outside of it. There might be a way.\nTENDEXTER: ‘Might be’?\nDOCTOR: I think I know what’s going on now. I think I can stop the\nDOCTOR: killing. But it’s something of a gamble. If I’m wrong...\nTENDEXTER: What makes me think I’m not going to like this?\nTENDEXTER: 52\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 30. HANGAR/FIGHTER COCKPIT\nSAM: (HUSHED) What’s happening? Rachel? I think we should get down from here.\nRACHEL: (HUSHED) A few more seconds. If I can just get power to the cockpit systems... (FX: HITS DASHBOARD) Blast it!\nSAM: I can’t see the Selachian. It could be sneaking up behind us. Rachel...\nRACHEL: I doubt it. That armour isn’t made for sneaking. Pass me that wrench, would you, Sam?\nSAM: This fighter wouldn’t even be here if.. I mean, this is a maintenance hangar. And even if we could... Once you get the engines running, how are we supposed to get the Selachian standing by the intake valves?\nRACHEL: (DISTRACTED) One worry at a time. If only the Doctor were here, he'd have a plan. He always had a plan. He didn’t always tell me what the plan was...\nSAM: You really think he could beat the Selachians?\nRACHEL: He’s done it before. Selachians, Sontarans, Autons. But this time... This time, even he seemed... He said that, this time — and this is ridiculous, because the last time we fought the Daleks, they were threatening the universe — this time, he said the stakes were the highest they’d ever been.\nSAM: Rachel, I...\nRACHEL: (STILL DISTRACTED) So, he takes me back to Earth. He plonks me right back down in my old life, working in the garage. Only he’s fixed it so that, a few days later, I get my call-up papers.\nSAM: Rachel, I think there... There’s something I should tell you.\nSAM: 53\nRACHEL: So, a week after that, I’m working on the Moonbase, and the Doctor — he’s already here, a prisoner. And he’s left me a list of instructions, but nothing about what to do when (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT) (FX: METALLIC THUNK) when things go wrong.\nSAM: The Selachians... (CRIES) Rachel, the Selachian! It’s found us! Jump, Rachel! Jump for it!\nRACHEL: (CRIES) Sam!\nRACHEL: 54\nRACHEL: SCENE 31.

You are prisoners of the Selachian Empire.\nTENDEXTER: Selachian Leader, hear me. I am Generalleutnant Adolph Tendexter, and I-—\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: We have been introduced. Troopers, kill everyone in this room!\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: (FX: THE SELACHIAN WEAPONS ARE COCKED AND CHARGED TO FIRE. SHOCKED REACTION)\nTENDEXTER: No, wait! We.. we’re doing what you wanted. We’ve put down our guns. I’ve called off the attack on your ships. We’re surrendering to you!\nDOCTOR: Stand down your troopers, Leader. That’s an order. There will be no more deaths today.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: And who are you, human, to give me orders? I am in command here! This Moonbase belongs to the Selachians!\nDOCTOR: Look more closely, Leader. I am not human. And you have achieved your objectives. The Reich’s time machine is destroyed; its former pilot is your prisoner. There she is, standing in front of you.\nKLEIN: What... what are you saying? You’re betraying me to them?\nTENDEXTER: Doctor, what is the meaning of this? You said you could—\nSELACHIAN LEADER: ‘Doctor’? I have heard that name.\nDOCTOR: That’s right, you have. I’m the reason you’re here. I gave your rulers the means to reach this Moonbase, a hundred years into their own past — and I told them how to conquer it. I planned this invasion, right down to the last detail. And that, Leader, is why I am now taking command.\nEND: PART TWO\nEND: 55"

The Reich’s time machine is destroyed; its former pilot is your prisoner. There she is, standing in front of you.\nKLEIN: What... what are you saying? You’re betraying me to them?\nTENDEXTER: Doctor, what is the meaning of this? You said you could—\nSELACHIAN LEADER: ‘Doctor’? I have heard that name.\nDOCTOR: That’s right, you have. I’m the reason you’re here. I gave your rulers the means to reach this Moonbase, a hundred years into their own past — and I told them how to conquer it. I planned this invasion, right down to the last detail. And that, Leader, is why I am now taking command.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 31 (cont).\nKLEIN: (FX: SLOW HAND CLAP) Oh, well played, Doctor. You certainly had me fooled. You have a ruthless streak in you, after all.\nDOCTOR: The prisoner will remain silent! Leader, you will take these humans to the detention block. Tendexter can show you the way. But ensure that Klein has a cell to herself. I haven’t finished with her.\nSELACIAN LEADER: Tendexter stays here.\nDOCTOR: That was not a request, Leader.\nDOCTOR: 56\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: The woman, Klein, is yours. That was your agreement with our Supreme Leader. But this human is mine. I have questions to put to him.\nDOCTOR: Oh, very well. But remember what I told you. No more deaths.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: I cannot promise that. The humans will be treated according to their actions.

I did grow to appreciate the subtlety of that water drip, however. Do you hear that?\nKLEIN: I’m not deaf.\nDOCTOR: It’s artificial, of course. Intended to break the spirit of this cell’s occupant. A constant reminder to him — or to her — of the passing of time. Every minute, every second, every... (FX: DRIP) drip.\nKLEIN: Have you come here just to gloat? You’ve got what you wanted, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be so obtuse, Klein. I told you — I keep telling you — I’m not the Doctor you thought I was. I have no memory of this timeline of yours.\nKLEIN: All the same, our positions have been quite neatly reversed, haven’t they? Now you’re the one prepared to sacrifice the rest of us, prepared to go to any lengths, to bring back your world. Because that’s what this is all about, isn’t it? Your alliance with those monsters...\nDOCTOR: I swear, I didn’t know.\nKLEIN: How do you justify that to yourself? No, I can guess. Soon, this timeline will be erased. So, anyone who has suffered and died here for your sake — it won’t have happened any more. Your conscience will be clear.\nKLEIN: 60\nDOCTOR: What I said to the Selachian Leader, I couldn’t be sure any of it was true. I still don’t know the full extent of my alternative self’s plan — and I certainly don’t approve of it.\nKLEIN: Don’t you? I have seen hundreds of possible worlds — and one thing I have learned is that people rarely change. The Doctor of this timeline..

You’ve kept me here in this room like some... some slave to do your bidding. Whatever has happened out there—\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: (ROARS) One of your treacherous kind has murdered one of mine.\nTENDEXTER: And I’m supposed to be sorry about that? Why are you still here, anyway? You’ve destroyed our time machine. You’ve emptied our Vault of technology.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: I will decide when our work here is done.\nTENDEXTER: What... what’s happening now? What are these people doing back here?\nSELACHIAN: I brought the prisoners as you instructed, Leader. Six of them.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: I gave you fair warning, human. I told you what would happen if we were met with resistance.\nTENDEXTER: No! No, you can’t mean to... Earth knows what’s happening up here, you know. I alerted them as soon as your ships appeared. They’11 be making plans.\nSELACHTAN LEADER: The blood of my kind has been spilt, Tendexter. I will have the blood of yours in recompense. (TO THE SELACHIAN) Kill them.\nTENDEXTER: (CRIES) No!\nTENDEXTER: 62\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 35. HANGAR\nSAM: (BREATHLESS THROUGHOUT THIS SCENE) Are you certain it’s dead?\nRACHEL: (SAME) If it wasn’t, I would be by now. I can’t imagine a live Selachian just lying here while I... (FX: WRENCH OF METAL) (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT) while I take its armour apart. (FX: HISSING —\nSOMEWHERE: BETWEEN SPARKING WIRES AND SNAKES) Oh, that’s charming, that is. That’s rank!\nSAM: They look like... worms! Is that... is that the Selachian?\nRACHEL: No, Sam. That, I hope, is the inside of a transmat module. Organic wiring, you see, grown rather than made. The Zygons have something Similar.\nSAM: You talk about all this as if it’s normal. As if it’s something you see every day.\nRACHEL: Yeah, well. It’s been a long time, actually. But you can’t imagine what it’s like, Sam, out there. You think you know what life is about, but there’s so much more, so much they’ve been keeping from us.\nSAM: I know what you mean. They don’t want us to dream.\nRACHEL: I’m going to show you the stars, Sam. Like the Doctor showed me. Once we get out of here...\nSAM: If we get out of here. Can’t be much air left now. Can you make it work, the transmat?\nRACHEL: I think so. The tricky part will be unwiring it from the armour. It looks like.. oh, gross! It looks like those worms feed off the Selachian’s blood.\nSAM: (NAUSEATED) Maybe... maybe I’1l take another look round, see if I can’t find a pair of spacesuits after all.\nSAM: 63\nRACHEL: Yeah. Maybe you should. The pilots do leave their suits in the hangars sometimes. They’re not supposed to, but they do. And a quick space walk, that has to be better than... than trusting our component molecules to a bunch of... (FX: SQUELCH) (DISGUSTED) Oh, that’s not good!\nSAM: (STAGE WHISPER) Rachel? Rachel, it’s Richter. Richter’s body. He was lying right here. But—\nRACHEL: (CALLS FROM MID-DISTANCE) What was that, Sam?\nSAM: (A LOUDER HISS) Major Richter! He’s gone! Disappeared!\nRICHTER: Don’t worry, Citizen Kirke, I haven’t gone far. Fortunately, the body armour of the thirty-first century is every bit as good as its weaponry. Now, as I recall, we were interrupted in mid-‘witch hunt’...\nRICHTER: 64\nRICHTER: SCENE 36. PRISON CELL\nKLEIN: Tell me about him, Doctor. About Faber.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? You didn’t want to know before.\nKLEIN: You remember what I told you, of course. In your timeline. I thought you’d have forgotten. Was he really here?\nDOCTOR: You tell me. The man you loved and lost... And you with a ship that can take you anywhere in space and time. Why didn’t you go back for him?\nKLEIN: I always thought, one day... one day, when my work was done. But somehow, I kept... I just kept putting it off. Maybe I was afraid that—\nDOCTOR: Or maybe you weren’t. Just how many people did you train in the use of my TARDIS, Klein?\nKLEIN: You don’t mean... No. No, they couldn’t have.\nDOCTOR: When you rewrote history, you made yourself the most important person in it. A Lord of Time. Everyone was afraid of you, including the leaders you professed to serve. And what do you Suppose frightened them the most?\nKLEIN: The Fihrer — every one I ever met — was afraid that my contact with outsiders would... change me, that I might turn against him.\nDOCTOR: Not a pleasant thought, is it? That your past itself might not be your own? That somebody else might have looked at your life, and decided that it needed a few small changes. To keep you in your place.\nKLEIN: And... and what about your past? What would you like to change? I think we both know, now, why you came to this Moonbase. You wanted to lure me here. And you orchestrated the Selachians’ attack—\nDOCTOR: None of that was me! That was my other self. The Doctor who belongs in this timeline.\nDOCTOR: 65\nKLEIN: Nevertheless, I’m here. You’re here. They’re here. And you’re running out of options. So, tell me, Doctor, what next? Are you going to do it? Are you going to execute me?\nDOCTOR: You seem remarkably sanguine about that prospect.\nKLEIN: I didn’t expect to feel.. almost relieved, I suppose. That it’s over. You were right about one thing, at least. No matter how many trips I took in the TARDIS, how much I changed, I could never quite make things right.\nDOCTOR: Of course you couldn’t. I could have told you that from the start, Klein. You could never go home.\nKLEIN: You.. you won’t do it. You won’t kill me. You’re too squeamish.\nDOCTOR: You're right. I won’t. Apart from anything else, it would achieve very little, now that you no longer have a time machine. I didn’t come here to execute you, Klein — no version of me did. What I came here to do, I’m beginning to suspect, was something far worse.\nDOCTOR: 66\nDOCTOR: SCENE 37. OPERATIONS CENTRE/CORRIDOR\nSELACHTAN LEADER: You will begin now, Tendexter.\nTENDEXTER: You don’t have to do this. Why don’t we find the Doctor? Why don’t we talk to him before—?\nSELACHIAN LEADER: You know what you have to say. My troopers are fetching six more prisoners as we speak. If you would rather exchange places with one of them...\nTENDEXTER: No, I’1l do it. I.. I need a moment to collect my thoughts, that’s all. (FX: CONTROLS) (DEEP BREATH) Attention, all Moonbase personnel, this is your Command— This is Tendexter. I’ve been asked to speak to you, because... (FX: CUT TO CORRIDOR, SPEECH\nCONTINUES: OVER SPEAKER) something has happened. One of the Selachians, our occupiers, has been killed. And the Selachian Leader... the Selachian Leader and I would like the culprit to come forward. If he does, I have been promised that nobody else will be hurt. The Selachians will take what they want and they’1ll leave us be. Otherwise... They’ve already shot six people. Colleagues of ours. Friends. They say that, until the man who killed their trooper comes forward, there will be six more deaths every half- hour. I’m appealing to you, all of you, please... We can’t beat these monsters. It’s futile to even try.\nCONTINUES: (THE SPEECH CROSSFADES TO A TANNOY AT THE START OF THE FOLLOWING SCENE )\nCONTINUES: 67\nCONTINUES: SCENE 38. HANGAR\nCONTINUES: (FX:WE HEAR THE LAST FEW WORDS OF THE ADDRESS AND THERE IS A\nSTATIC: SQUEAL AS SPEAKER CUTS OUT, RACHEL TINKERING)\nSAM: (STILL BREATHLESS) What... what do we do? You heard what the Commandant said. If we don’t turn ourselves in—\nRACHEL: (SAME) It might be a moot point, Sam. I’ve got the transmat device unwired from the armour, but I can’t... Without Selachian blood to power it...\nRICHTER: (SAME) If you can’t make that device work, Citizen Cooper, then the two of you are dead.\nRACHEL: You mean the three of us, don’t you?\nSAM: Can’t we at least contact the Selachians? Tell them it was us that killed their trooper, and that we... we’re dying anyway?\nRICHTER: There’s a spacesuit next to the back wall. One person can walk out of here. Of course, the other two will die when he opens the door.\nRACHEL: So, let me guess. We draw straws, right?\nRICHTER: That would be one option. Another would be that the man with the gun gets the spacesuit. A pity, really. Citizen Kirke here will be no loss to anyone, but you.. I would have liked to have saved you, Citizen Cooper. I would have liked to have heard how that story of yours ends.\nSAM: What are you doing?\nRICHTER: Don’t worry, I wouldn’t waste a charge cycle on shooting you. What would be the point? But I did think I might destroy that transmat device before I leave. Just in case you haven’t been entirely honest with me.\nRACHEL: No, don’t! I.. OK, there might be a way we can all get out of here.\nRACHEL: 68\nRICHTER: I’m listening.\nRACHEL: When I said I couldn’t.. What I mean is, I can maybe get one journey out of this thing. The trouble is, it was designed for personal use. It can only take the weight of one Selachian.\nRICHTER: But one Selachian in its armour must be as heavy as two people.\nRACHEL: That’s right. Two. Not three. And the spacesuit would still be safer. Why don’t you take that, and Sam and I can—?\nRICHTER: I don’t think so, Citizen Cooper. I would rather keep you within reach. We will transmat out of here together, while Citizen Kirke... well, I’m not sure I can allow a traitor to the Galactic Reich to walk free.\nRACHEL: You kill him, Richter — you hurt Sam in any way — and I swear, I’ll short this thing out myself. Here, take this!\nRICHTER: What are you—?\nRACHEL: The Selachian’s gauntlet. Grab hold. One-time offer, Richter. Live or die. But you have to decide right now.\nRICHTER: You’re bluffing, of course. You wouldn’t sacrifice yourself, wouldn’t jeopardise whatever plans you have made with your Doctor friend, for the sake of a cleaner. But very well, I will play your game. After all, what harm can it—? (FX: CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY)\nSAM: (CRIES) What did you do?\nRACHEL: Take my hand, Sam. We’re getting out of here.\nRICHTER: (WEAK, STRAINED) You won’t get away with this! (FX: GUNSHOT) I will track you down and I will kill you both, do you hear me? I\nRICHTER: will kill you both!\nRICHTER: 69\nRICHTER: SCENE 39. PRISON CELL\nKLEIN: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: You heard Tendexter’s broadcast. There are people in danger. I’m going to help them.\nKLEIN: You’re insane! The Selachians—\nDOCTOR: As it seems I brought them here, it’s up to me to deal with them.\nKLEIN: Not this time, Doctor. You know what you’re supposed to do this time. You’ve already admitted—\nDOCTOR: You wouldn’t understand. You were wrong about me, Klein. What happens here, in this timeline, it does matter. Those people out there matter. I can’t let them suffer. I won’t.\nKLEIN: Everything you said about the web of Time... about the damage I did to it, the broken strands... was any of that true?\nDOCTOR: Every word.\nKLEIN: Then what right have you to walk out of here now? We’re talking about a handful of lives, weighed against the whole of space and time. And you’re willing to take that gamble, risk everything, to make a point?\nDOCTOR: It’s more than that. I’m not that man, Klein, the man you want me to be. You can say what you like, even rewrite my past, but it doesn’t change who I am. If I can save them, I will. I’m the Doctor. And that’s what I do.\nDOCTOR: 70\nDOCTOR: SCENE 40. CORRIDOR\nRACHEL: (HUSHED) That’s him, Sam. That’s the Doctor! What’s he still doing here?\nSAM: That’s the Doctor?\nRACHEL: Do you think he saw us? He seemed to glance this way. If I could just speak to him. If that Selachian wasn’t standing guard over him...\nSAM: It doesn’t look like it’s standing guard. It looks more like... (FX: DOCTOR AND SELACHIAN MOVE AWAY) like an escort to me. As if the Doctor’s the one giving the orders.\nRACHEL: That’s the way to the Operations Centre. But, Sam, he was supposed to meet us. He was supposed to meet me. Outside Hangar Fourteen. And I thought... I think he was supposed to bring Klein with him.\nSAM: You ‘think’?\nRACHEL: Maybe... maybe, if he heard Tendexter’s broadcast... Yeah, that’1ll be it, he wouldn’t leave those people to die! But... what about us, Sam? What do we do? What if he needs our help?\nSAM: We could make things worse by interfering. We should just do as the Doctor said, find a pair of spacesuits and—\nRACHEL: It’s been six months since I spoke to him. He’s always been too well guarded. Six months! Anything could have happened in that time. What if things have changed? What if.. Sam! Sam, are you OK?\nSAM: (WEAK) I’m OK. I just... I had a bit of a dizzy turn there.\nRACHEL: Your shoulder... Oh God, why didn’t you tell me? You’ve been shot!\nSAM: It’s OK, Rachel. Really, it’s OK. It’s just a flesh wound. Richter... As we transmatted out of the hangar—\nSAM: 71\nRACHEL: Let me see. I said, let me see. Oh, Sam, you should have told me. I should have noticed, instead of blathering on about... That gun, Richter’s gun, it fired plasma bullets. They don’t just burn your skin, they burst inside your body. We have to get you some help.\nSAM: No time. Too dangerous. Hangar Fourteen... If that’s where we’re going, I can hold on till we get there. I can... (GROANS)\nRACHEL: (CRIES) Sam!\nRACHEL: 72\nRACHEL: SCENE 41. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nSELACHTAN LEADER: This is intolerable, Doctor. You have no right to interfere in—\nDOCTOR: I have every right, according to my agreement with your Supreme Leader. If you have a problem with that—\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: One of my troopers is dead. There must be consequences, else the surface dwellers will think us weak.\nDOCTOR: What did you expect? Your bombs slaughtered them in their hundreds. They’re always going to fight you.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: You were not so squeamish when you planned that attack. You agreed that the destruction of the atmospheric bubble was the most efficient—\nDOCTOR: That was then. I said ‘no more deaths’, Leader, and I meant it.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: You know what these humans did, what they will do to us in the future. I will not let that happen again. Those, Doctor, are my orders.\nTENDEXTER: Do you think... Did you get through to him? Will he stop the executions?\nDOCTOR: For now. The Selachians like to throw their weight around — but, beneath all that, they’re basically insecure. So long as our agreement stands, they won’t risk breaking it. I’m sure they know what I can do.\nTENDEXTER: Is it true what he said? Is all this, what they’re doing here... Is it all just payback for what we’ll do to them some day?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t seen the future of your timeline, Tendexter. But if it’s anything like the one I have seen, the human race has a great deal to answer for.\nTENDEXTER: Then it’s the same where you come from? Things are no better there?\nTENDEXTER: 73\nDOCTOR: I never said my world was perfect.\nDOCTOR: 74\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42. CORRIDOR\nSELACHIAN: Halt! This base is under Selachian control. Access to other life forms is denied. Identify yourself!\nRICHTER: (FX: THROUGH A TINY SPEAKER, DISTORTED, UNRECOGNISABLE) Don’t shoot. I’ve come to turn myself in. I have information for you.\nSELACHIAN: I said, identify yourself. Remove the spacesuit helmet, and show me your face.\nRICHTER: Very well. (FX: CLIPS UNDONE, HISS OF ESCAPING AIR) (NORMAL VOICE) Major Richter, Assistant Head of Temporal Affairs for the Galactic Reich. And if you’re interested, I can tell you who killed your comrade out there.\nSELACHIAN: Tell me what you know.\nRICHTER: In a moment. First, I have a question for you. Those guns your lot wear strapped to your arms — could they penetrate your own armour?\nSELACHIAN: It is not for you to question Selachian technology.\nRICHTER: I’ll find out for myself, then.\nRICHTER: 75\nRICHTER: SCENE 43. PRISON CELL\nKLEIN: (CALLS) Who’s there? What’s happening out there? (FX: FOOTSTEPS\nAPPROACH: DOOR) Doctor? Doctor, is that you?\nRICHTER: No, Oberst Klein. It is not your outsider friend.\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) Richter! I might have guessed. Where did you get the gun?\nKLEIN: (FX: RICHTER CROSSES THE CELL IN A COUPLE OF PACES, UNLOCKS HER CHAINS)\nRICHTER: I pulled it off the arm of a dead Selachian. There’s another one outside the door. But we need to move, before they—\nKLEIN: Oh, no, no, no. I’m not going anywhere with you.\nRICHTER: You don’t have any choice.\nKLEIN: I believe I do. I believe the Doctor will come to his senses and return for me. In the meantime, this cell is the safest place for me to be.\nRICHTER: So, you confess that you are working with him now.\nKLEIN: I have... reached a decision, yes. And what about you, Richter? Who do you work for? You’ve always been ambitious. Enough so to have taken my TARDIS, behind my back? To have interfered in my past?\nRICHTER: That’s ‘Major Richter’ to you. And I don’t know what you’re talking about. But I think you’ve misunderstood me, Klein. You have no choice but to come with me — because if you don’t, I will shoot you.\nKLEIN: You’ve picked the wrong time to stage a mutiny, Major Richter. I have no ship for you to seize.\nKLEIN: 76\nRICHTER: You know, I wasn’t just appointed to be your deputy. I pulled every string I could for the chance to work with you. I’d heard how efficient, how ruthless, you were. I could see from the start that something had changed. You were always just going through the motions.\nKLEIN: Then leave me, Richter. Let me stay here! You don’t need me.\nRICHTER: You’ve no idea how tempting that sounds. But you have more experience with time machines than I do.\nKLEIN: You mean you’ve found the other TARDIS? The one in which the alternative Doctor travelled here? (TO SELF, TRIUMPHANTLY) I knew I was right. I knew it had to exist. (TO RICHTER) But... but you won't be able to get inside it.\nRICHTER: I haven’t found the Doctor’s time machine yet, but I do know where to look for it. And I know who must have the key.\nRICHTER: 77\nRICHTER: SCENE 44. CORRIDOR\nRACHEL: (STRAINED) Come on, Sam, we’re almost there. One foot in front of the other, that’s it. (CRIES) Sam!\nSAM: (WEAK, BREATHING LABOURED) I can’t... can’t go on. Please, just have to rest.\nRACHEL: You can rest all you like once we get you patched up. The medical bay’s right around the next corner. Come on!\nSAM: Even if we could... Rachel, it’s too late!\nRACHEL: It’s not too late. I’1ll get help. (SHOUTS) Help, somebody help us!\nSAM: No! You know what... what the Selachians will do to you if they catch you. Should have left me behind. Should have done that right from the start.\nRACHEL: I won’ t-\nSAM: Go back to the stars for me, Rachel. You gave me a chance to be a hero. I don’t... don’t want it to have all been for nothing.\nRACHEL: It won’t be. I swear to you, it won’t be. The Selachians think they’ve won, but—\nSAM: Please, Rachel, don’t.\nSAM: My ship, the Doctor’s ship, it’s a TARDIS. Like Klein’s. A time machine. It’s outside Hangar Fourteen. We’re going to rewrite history one last time, Sam. That was the plan all along. We’re going to put things right.\nSAM: Don’t... don’t say any more. I’m not the man you think I am. The Selachians. They... they brought me here. From the future. I’ma spy, Rachel. I’m working for them.\nSAM: 78\nRACHEL: You're... what?\nSAM: I tried to tell you in the hangar. The Selachians told me to get close to you. I didn’t know why. They said they’d set me free, and I.. I didn’t think I could stand up to them, then. But you showed me...\nRACHEL: You can do it now, Sam. You can stand up to them now.\nSAM: (FADING) You don’t... don’t understand. They couldn’t risk normal radio contact, so.. Something in my brain. When I sleep, it uploads my memories to their flagship. Everything I’ve seen, everything you told me... And I think... Rachel, I think I have to sleep now.\nRACHEL: (TEARFUL) Oh, Sam. Sam, I am so, so sorry. I shouldn’t have got you into this. I should have found some other way. But... but I’11 find you again. In a world with no Galactic Reich, and no Selachians, where you’1ll be free to be everything you were ever meant to be. And I’1l make sure you know what you did today, that you saved the whole world, and...\nRACHEL: And I will keep my promise to you, Sam Kirke. I will show you the stars. Somehow. Some day.\nRACHEL: 719\nRACHEL: SCENE 45. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nSELACHIAN LEADER: So, Doctor. You intended to betray us all along.\nDOCTOR: What on earth gave you that idea? I assure you—\nSELACHIAN LEADER: My sources are none of your concern. Do not compound your crime by attempting to deny it. You thought you could use us to topple the humans’ empire, then snatch our spoils from us.\nTENDEXTER: Doctor, look at this. More of their ships. They’re popping up all around us. Hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: What is this, Leader? Our agreement...\nSELACHTAN LEADER: Our agreement is void, Doctor. You broke it when you plotted behind our backs. But we expected no less. That is why we made plans of our own.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t possible. I couldn’t have.. I wouldn’t have let this happen.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: You gave us the means to shift six warcraft backwards in time. Your mistake was in thinking us too stupid to replicate those means.\nTENDEXTER: The ships. They... They’re headed towards Earth. They’1ll be within firing range in about thirty seconds.\nDOCTOR: Stop this. I order you to stop this at once.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: I do not take orders from plankton. You underestimated us. You will not do so again. We are about to make an example of these surface creatures, one that they will still speak of in awe and fear in our own time.\nDOCTOR: No!\nDOCTOR: 80\nTENDEXTER: Listen to me, please. I know we’ve mistreated you in the past — in your past — and on behalf of the human race, I apologise. Do you hear me? I’m sorry. We’re sorry. But none of us here, today, know anything about that. You can’t punish an entire race for something we’ll never do.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: I’m sure your Head of Temporal Affairs would disagree.\nTENDEXTER: (PLAINTIVELY) Please, my family is down there.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: Then they will die, Tendexter. My pilots have instructions to reduce your world to a ball of cinders. And then, with the technology that the Doctor has provided for us, the Selachians will be the new masters of Time.\nEND: PART THREE\nEND: 81"

Planning an excursion?\nRACHEL: (SIGHS, DEFEATED) I thought I’d stretch my legs, take a stroll along the ramp. I’d invite you to join me, Richter — if you weren’t wearing a spacesuit yourself.\nKLEIN: (WEARILY) Look, I don’t like this any more than you do, Miss Cooper. But you will take us to the Doctor’s TARDIS.\nRACHEL: The Doctor’s what?\nRICHTER: We know you must have a key. I can take it from your dead body if you’d rather.\nRACHEL: Yeah, I noticed you’d got yourself a bigger gun. Won’t do you much good, though, Richter. There is no key.\nRACHEL: 82\nRICHTER: You must think me a fool. I heard you talking to Citizen Kirke. I know you came here with the Doctor. And I know you headed straight for Hangar Fourteen when the Selachians arrived.\nRACHEL: (SPITS) Oh, bad mistake, Richter — mentioning Sam’s name. Want to know why? Because now I don’t care if you do shoot me dead. Go on, do it, throw away your only chance to save yourself. I’d like that.\nKLEIN: This TARDIS, I assume, won’t open for anyone but the Doctor or you?\nRACHEL: It won’t even show itself to anyone else. So, you see, Klein, you have a problem — because the only way the two of you are getting inside that ship is over my dead body. And that just isn’t possible.\nRACHEL: 83\nRACHEL: SCENE 47. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nTENDEXTER: You see? You see that, Leader? Ships launched from the Earth to meet your fleet. I told you they’d be ready for you. Call off this war, before it starts. You can still spare both sides a great deal of bloodshed.\nSELACHTAN LEADER: Your ships are outnumbered, Tendexter — and, I suspect, no more capable than the ones we have already destroyed. The only blood shed today will be warm blood.\nDOCTOR: And even if Earth could win this battle, the Selachians would just go back in time and fight it a different way — isn’t that right, Leader?\nSELACHTAN LEADER: I instructed you to put on that spacesuit, Doctor. Do I have to start killing my hostages to make you comply?\nDOCTOR: There’1ll be no need for that. It’s just a little... (FX: RUSTLE OF FABRIC) (GRUNT OF EFFORT) tight around the shoulders. There!\nTENDEXTER: Are you happy now, Doctor? Do you see what you’ve done? You brought these creatures here. You have the blood of the human race on your hands!\nDOCTOR: (FX: DISTORT AS IN SCENE 42) All right, Leader, I’m ready. What do we do now? All stand in a ring, hold hands, click our heels together and chant ‘There’s no place like—’?\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: Now, Doctor, these two troopers and I will transmat out onto the ramp, and take you with us. We will arrive in the vicinity of Hangar Fourteen — where, according to my information, we will find your TARDIS. You will guide us towards it, and open its doors to us.\nDOCTOR: Typical Selachians. Never satisfied with what you have. Always worrying that somebody somewhere might have a bigger gun, a deadlier bomb. Or a better time machine.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: Not any more, Doctor. Not after today.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: 84\nSELACHIAN LEADER: 85\nSELACHIAN LEADER: SCENE 48. MOONBASE RAMP\nSELACHIAN LEADER: (FX: THE TOTAL SILENCE OF VACUUM. FOR THE DURATION OF THIS SCENE, WE ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDE THE DOCTOR’S HELMET)\nDOCTOR: So. Here we are, then. And that must be Hangar Fourteen. Anyone see a time machine around here?\nSELACHIAN LEADER: (FX: OVER RADIO) Do not insult my intelligence. The machine is obviously camouflaged.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it is. But what you have failed to quite grasp, Leader, is that this version of me has never been out here before. This\nTARDIS: you’re looking for, it could be anything: that fighter ship, the hangar itself... It could be hiding behind that stone ziggurat.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: Troopers, search behind that.. that.. what did you say?\nDOCTOR: It’s a matter of perspective, I suppose.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: I am losing patience, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But then, I expect some things haven’t changed that much in this timeline. For example, I was never an especially skilled pilot. It would be just like me to — I don’t know — park across those hangar doors?\nSELACHIAN LEADER: There is nothing in front of the hangar. Nothing except... except...\nDOCTOR: Funny, isn’t it, how sometimes you can look right at an object without seeing it? Of course, when you’re dealing with an advanced perception filter...\nSELACHTAN LEADER: The ziggurat! There is a ziggurat in front of Hangar Fourteen! How did I not...?\nDOCTOR: You saw it. You just didn’t think it was important. You didn’t even bat an eyelid as I placed my hands on the locking pad and opened this door. Do you have eyelids, by the way? What was that you were saying, Leader? Something in front of the hangar?\nDOCTOR: 86\nSELACHTAN LEADER: I.. I don’t remember. There was something important... Something was here! What was just here?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, it’ll all come back to you. Especially if I were to present your brain with a stimulus it can’t so readily ignore — like, for example, the sight of me stepping through this doorway. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS DOORS CLOSE. RUSH OF AIR AS THE CONSOLE ROOM PRESSURISES. FADE UP THE HUM OF THE CONSOLE ROOM. NOTE THAT THIS IS A NEW MODEL TARDIS, AND MAY SOUND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO THE USUAL. THE DOCTOR WALKS ACROSS THE ROOM, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING,\nOPERATES: CONTROLS )\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: Doctor? Doctor, where have you...? The ziggurat! He is inside the ziggurat. Fire at the ziggurat, you fools, before he... (FX: TARDIS\nDEMATERIALISATION: SOUND. SELACHIAN LEADER'S VOICE BREAKS UP AS\nRADIO: CONTACT IS LOST) (ROARS) Doctor, I will see you dead for this, I swear.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Not today, you won’t.\nDOCTOR: 87\nDOCTOR: SCENE 49. CORRIDOR\nKLEIN: That sound. Is that... is that what I think it is?\nRACHEL: The Doctor! He must have escaped from the Selachians. He must have made it back to the TARDIS.\nRICHTER: How very thoughtful of him. He has saved us a journey. OK, the pair of you, start moving down that corridor.\nRACHEL: I don’t think so, Richter. This doesn’t change a thing as far as I’m concerned. I’m going nowhere with you.\nRICHTER: I would suggest that it changes one thing, Citizen Cooper. I no longer need you. The Doctor will open his time machine for me.\nRACHEL: Yeah, good luck with that.\nKLEIN: She’s worth more to you alive, Richter. I remember what the Doctor is like about his ‘companions’. And if I may make one more observation...\nRICHTER: We have two choices, ladies. We can stand here until the Selachians find us, or we can—\nKLEIN: It sounded to me like the TARDIS materialised by the detention block. The Doctor is looking for me. He needs me. I think you know that, don’t you, Miss Cooper? You must have an inkling of what he has planned.\nRACHEL: Yeah, right. And you... you’re just going to go along with that, are you?\nKLEIN: Considering the alternative.\nRICHTER: Fine. So, the Doctor wants you. He wants you. And as I believe I might have mentioned already, I’m the one with the gun. So, no one is going anywhere without me.\nRICHTER: 88\nKLEIN: We all want the same thing, Miss Cooper. We want to reach that\nKLEIN: time machine. And we stand more chance of achieving that goal if we all work together. So, what do you say, both of you? Truce?\nKLEIN: 89\nKLEIN: SCENE 50. FIGHTER COCKPIT\nKLEIN: (FX: BRIEF SNATCH OF SPACE BATTLE — LASERS FIRING, SHIPS SWOOPING BY, EXPLOSIONS. THEN MOVE INTO FIGHTER ENGINE COCKPIT, ENGINES ROARING, SHIP ROCKED BY MORE EXPLOSIONS )\nPILOT: (FX: OVER RADIO) Eagle One-Four-One to Eagle Command. Requesting instructions. I.. They hit my weapons mountings. I can’t... I’m helpless, don’t know what to do. They’re firing on the Earth. God help us.. I can see whole continents, burning. We’re trying our best, but the sharks... It’s like they don’t even know we’re up here. Well, I’m going to make them notice us. I’ve seen... If we hit them just right, we can break through their shields, start a chain reaction in their engines, take them down with us. I.. I don’t know if I can, but... I can’t see my home any more. There’s just... just smoke. Everything I ever knew, everyone I ever loved. I don’t know if you can hear me, Eagle Command. If you can... Wish me luck. Pray for a miracle. Eagle One-Four-One... out.\nPILOT: 90\nPILOT: SCENE 51. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nTENDEXTER: Enjoy your victory while you can, you shark. You know as well as I do, it’s meaningless now. You’ve let the Doctor escape.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: You forget, we know the secret of time travel too. The Doctor will be found and destroyed.\nTENDEXTER: If I were him, do you know where I’d be right now? I’d be orbiting your home world, a million years ago, when you were just microbes floating in the sea. And I’d have with me enough photonic missiles to sterilise that wretched planet.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: You appear to have found your spirit, Tendexter. What are you trying to hide from me?\nTENDEXTER: I don’t know what you mean. Shoot me if you like. I have nothing to lose.\nSELACHTAN LEADER: And nothing to gain. Move away from the console. Move! (FX: FOOTSTEPS) That light. What does that light signify?\nTENDEXTER: It ‘signifies’ that you should have kept a closer eye on me, instead of letting the Doctor distract you. Here. (FX: CONTROLS) I had disabled the warning system, but you may as well hear it now.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Warning. Reactor core building to overload. Estimated time to explosion: eleven minutes and twenty seconds.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: You... you will kill your own people!\nTENDEXTER: Before you can, you mean? (FX: CONTROLS) You’re wasting your time. I closed the Doctor’s back door into the control systems. Even I couldn’t open it again in the time we have left.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: (FX: ACTIVATES COMMUNICATOR) All troopers will return to their warcraft.\nTENDEXTER: That’s right, run while you still can. Go back to your people. Tell them that the human race won’t die quietly.\nTENDEXTER: Gal.\nSELACHTAN LEADER: But you will die. You are still trapped on this base, If this is an attempt at a bluff — if the base is not your actions — then trust me, it will be destroyed by\nTENDEXTER: (TO SELF) Ah, but you haven’t seen the full extent of just yet. We’ll be seeing each other again, Selachian\nTENDEXTER: 92\nTENDEXTER: Tendexter. destroyed by mine.\nTENDEXTER: my ‘actions’ Leader.\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 52. CORRIDOR\nSELACHIAN: (NERVOUS) Please repeat your instructions, Leader. I did not receive... Leader, can you hear me? Leader?\nDOCTOR: Your communicator won’t work, I’m afraid. Sonic screwdriver. You see, I’d rather nobody else knew I was still here.\nSELACHIAN: Halt! Drop the weapon, or I will—\nDOCTOR: Shoot me? That appears to be the Selachians’ answer to everything. How old are you, Trooper?\nSELACHIAN: That is none of your concern. I...\nDOCTOR: Not more than four or five cycles, I suspect. Still young. Inexperienced.\nSELACHIAN: The occupant of this cell — did you free her? Did you... did you kill the guard?\nDOCTOR: Certainly not. He was shot by one of your own guns. And I'd rather like to know where Klein is myself.\nSELACHIAN: I instructed you to drop the weapon.\nDOCTOR: I heard you. But the sonic screwdriver isn’t a weapon. Not like you mean. It doesn’t fire rays, it won’t explode. It won’t protect me from your gun.\nSELACHIAN: Then... then you will surrender. I will take you to my Leader, and he will decide what to do with—\nDOCTOR: But one thing it can do. The one thing it was designed for, the\nDOCTOR: one thing it excels at.. It can open things.\nSELACHIAN: Open...?\nSELACHIAN: 93\nDOCTOR: There’s an access hatch in that armour of yours, at the base of the fin. Kill me... and as I die, I will press this button. I will open that hatch.\nSELACHIAN: You are bluffing. There is no device that could do such a thing.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t there? I reckon it would take... oh, about twenty seconds for that armoured suit to drain. Not nearly enough time for anyone to miss you, to come looking for you, to find you dying here.\nSELACHIAN: I.. I have my instructions. My Leader would—\nDOCTOR: I won’t tell him if you don’t. We could both turn our backs, walk away and pretend we never saw each other. We could both survive. Or we could both die. Your choice. What do you say?\nDOCTOR: 94\nDOCTOR: SCENE 53. CORRIDOR\nRACHEL: No one down this corridor either. Come on.\nRICHTER: Not so fast, Citizen Cooper. We will proceed with caution.\nRACHEL: Why? I told you, Richter, I saw the Selachians transmatting out of here. You’re just wasting time.\nRICHTER: You saw two Selachians leaving. We don’t know that the rest of their number went with them.\nKLEIN: However, if they did leave, then they likely had good reason. The sooner we can reach the Doctor’s TARDIS—\nRICHTER: You will proceed to the end of the corridor, Citizen Cooper. Check that there are no enemies lurking around the next corner.\nRACHEL: Why do I get all the plum jobs? No, don’t tell me, I remember. You’re the one with the gun, right?\nKLEIN: Listen to the girl, Richter. She has — we both have — far more experience of this sort of situation than—\nRICHTER: Wait! That sound! What—?\nRACHEL: (CRIES) Incoming!\nSELACHIAN: #1: Where am I? Who are you? What have you done? Identify yourselves!\nKLEIN: Now, while it’s disoriented. Run!\nKLEIN: (FX: TWO SHOTS FROM SELACHIAN GUN, THEY RUN A FEW STEPS, SELACHIAN #2 STEPS OUT IN THEIR PATH)\nRACHEL: There’s another one!\nRACHEL: 95\nSELACHIAN: #2: Halt! You will surrender yourselves for execution.\nSELACHIAN: (FX: RICHTER AND SELACHIAN #2 EXCHANGE FIRE; RICHTER’S SELACHIAN\nGUN: IS LOSING POWER, GASPING AND WHINING)\nRACHEL: Get down! Klein! Klein, what are you doing?\nSELACHIAN: #2:\nRICHTER: My gun, it’s out of power. Where... where is my...?\nKLEIN: Your plasma pistol? It’s right here, Major Richter. It’s pointed at your head. (FX: COCKS GUN) (CALLS) Don’t shoot. I have everything under control. (FX: SELACHIANS CLOSE IN, HALT) My name is Oberst Elizabeth Klein, and I am on your side. I have been working with the Doctor—\nRACHEL: Don’t listen to her, she’s lying!\nSELACHIAN: #1: The Doctor has proven himself a traitor.\nKLEIN: All the more reason, then, to spare me. I have knowledge of time travel. That technology is still new to you, but I have been studying it, working with it, all my life. I can help you.\nSELACHIAN: #2: You were attempting to escape.\nKLEIN: That isn’t true. I was made to leave my cell at gunpoint. These people here—\nRACHEL: We're her assistants. Klein couldn’t do a thing without us. No one knows their way around the inside of a TARDIS console like I do, while Richter—\nKLEIN: (LAUGHS) A nice try, Miss Cooper. I’m particularly impressed that you tried to save Richter as well. But no. These two are of no use to me. Not only that, but they are responsible for the deaths of at least—\nKLEIN: 96\nRICHTER: I will kill you for this, Klein. Do you hear me? I’11 kill you!\nKLEIN: (LOUDER, OVER HIM) —the deaths of at least two of your troopers. Not to mention the damage they just inflicted on you with a weapon wrested from a Selachian corpse. These are the fugitives you have been searching for. Your instructions on how to deal with them, I believe, are perfectly clear.\nKLEIN: 97\nKLEIN: SCENE 54. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nSELACHIAN LEADER: What happened? Why are we still here? Why did the transmat not work?\nSELACHIAN: Diagnostics inconclusive, Leader. Could the Doctor have... Could he...?\nTENDEXTER: The Doctor isn’t to blame for everything. All right, he may have provided a little inspiration — but I fought in the Dalek War, you know. I was decorated for my—\nSELACHTAN LEADER: (ANGRILY) What did you do?\nTENDEXTER: Adjusted the frequency of the reactor core output. It’s bouncing your transmat signals right back where they came from. You’re trapped here.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: No!\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately six minutes.\nTENDEXTER: Earth might be finished, but we’ll take the leader of our enemies down with us.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: What... what do you want, Tendexter? Name your terms.\nTENDEXTER: I want you to call off your invasion. I want you to leave this solar system, this time, and never return. But even if you promised that, I wouldn’t believe you. And it would make no difference if I did. As I’ve already told you, I can’t reverse what I’ve done.\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: You are lying. You must have a shutdown code. You will give it to\nSELACHTIAN LEADER: me.\nTENDEXTER: Or else..? ‘Nothing to lose’, remember.\nTENDEXTER: 98\nSELACHTAN LEADER: You will give that code to me, or you will die in agony. Six minutes is a long time, Tendexter — (FX: STOMPS TOWARDS HIM) and you will learn just how much pain a Selachian warrior can inflict in that time.\nTENDEXTER: 99\nTENDEXTER: SCENE 55. CORRIDOR\nTENDEXTER: (FX: DOCTOR AND KLEIN RUN FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, MEET.\nSELACHIAN: GUNFIRE FROM BEHIND KLEIN)\nKLEIN: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Klein! I’ve been looking for you. Where—?\nKLEIN: Does this mean you’ve seen reason at last? I know you have a\nTARDIS: nearby. Where is it? Tell me!\nDOCTOR: Can’t you see it, Klein? It’s right here.\nKLEIN: Then we have to get out of here. Doctor? (FX: GUNFIRE ENDS) Oh no, no, don’t you dare. Don’t you even think about racing headlong into danger again. Don’t you ever learn?\nDOCTOR: But those gunshots—\nKLEIN: —are none of our concern.\nDOCTOR: You never did much care about the mess you left behind you.\nKLEIN: You can’t save everyone. And the more you try, the greater the risk that you’ll lose the ones who matter. (BEAT) The firing has stopped.\nDOCTOR: So, the Selachians will be on the hunt for fresh prey. I can’t argue with your logic, Klein. I never could. That doesn’t mean I have to like it.\nKLEIN: (SOFTER) I know what you’re thinking, Doctor. But it’s too late for her. Rachel Cooper gave her life so that we could escape. The best way to honour her memory is to take this chance she’s given us.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nDOCTOR: 100\nDOCTOR: SCENE 56. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS DOORS OPEN, CONSOLE ROOM HUM. DOCTOR AND KLEIN ENTER,\nVOICES: ECHOING)\nKLEIN: This is it, then. Your TARDIS in this timeline. It’s different from your usual models.\nDOCTOR: Just as well. I suspect, if you thought you could fly this ship, you would have pulled that gun on me by now. It won’t work in here, by the way.\nKLEIN: Black walls. Low lighting. It suits you, Doctor. It suits the real you. And it’s appropriate, of course. For an execution chamber.\nDOCTOR: As you said, Klein. ‘This is it, then.’\nKLEIN: We could still fix this. We could travel to the future, find a defence against the Selachians, deliver it to Tendexter in the past.\nDOCTOR: You don’t expect me to agree to that.\nKLEIN: No. No, I don’t. Because, for all your protestations, all your feigned innocence, you’ve always known how this was going to end. Your way.\nDOCTOR: You brought us to this. You’re the one who went rampaging through the past with no regard to the damage you were causing.\nKLEIN: I was happy in my life, Doctor. I was happy with my world. Until you came along. Until you tricked me into taking that first step. You started this.\nDOCTOR: You’re right, Klein. Again. I made a mistake. That’s why it’s up to me to fix it. (FX: CONTROLS) We’d better leave. Before the Selachians do to this TARDIS what they did to the last one. And then... (FX: TARDIS BEGINS TO DEMATERIALISE) Then, we have a great deal to talk about.\nDOCTOR: 101\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57. OPERATIONS CENTRE\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately two minutes and thirty seconds.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: (FX: ALARM SIREN. A RUMBLING FROM THE REACTOR CORE BEGINS GENTLY AND BUILDS THROUGH THIS SCENE)\nTENDEXTER: (MURMURS, WEAKLY) Underestimated us... You underestimated me.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: Damn your weak human flesh, Tendexter, I won’t let you do this to me. (FX: SLAP OF METAL GAUNTLET ACROSS FACE) Open your eyes, do you hear me? I demand that you open your eyes!\nTENDEXTER: Dying now. We’re all dying now.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: Tendexter! (ROAR OF RAGE)\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately two minutes.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: It can’t end like this. Our time machines... My troopers, my followers... Why aren’t they here? Why haven’t they saved me? This is your fault, Tendexter. You had best pray that there is no afterlife for us — because if there is, I will find you there. I will find you, and exact a bloody revenge from your soul. I ama Selachian warrior, a leader. You cannot defeat me just by... by dying.\nSELACHIAN LEADER: 102\nSELACHIAN LEADER: SCENE 58. CORRIDOR\nSELACHIAN LEADER: (FX: SIREN CONTINUES. RUMBLING FROM REACTOR CORE MORE INTENSE NOW, CONTINUING TO BUILD)\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately one minute and twenty seconds.\nRACHEL: (YELLS) Doctor! Doctor, it’s me, Rachel. I’m still here. Doctor! (FX: TARDIS GONE, SHE COLLAPSES) (PLAINTIVE, BREATHLESS) Doctor, I’m hurt. Took a shot to the arm. I need you, Doctor.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately one minute.\nSELACHIAN: (ONE OF THOSE FROM SCENE 53) You cannot escape, human. There is nowhere to run.\nRACHEL: Perfect. As if it’s not enough that the entire Moonbase is about to go up in our faces. Go on, then. Shoot me. Finish the job you started. Why should I even care?\nSELACHIAN: You are not afraid to die?\nRACHEL: I can think of worse things. Far worse things. Don’t you get it? It doesn’t matter any more. Nothing matters. Nothing we do, nothing we say. Because the Doctor has gone. He won. And he left us behind.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Reactor core will overload in approximately thirty seconds.\nSELACHIAN: This facility is doomed. There... there is no way out. For any of us.\nRACHEL: (TO SELF) Do you want to know what I’m afraid of, Doctor? Really afraid? I’m afraid you might not find me, in this new timeline of yours. I’m afraid I might live out my small, humdrum life, and never know how much more there was to see, how much more I could have been.\nRACHEL: 103\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Ten seconds.\nRACHEL: Everybody has to die, some time. I accept that, Doctor. What I can’t bear is the thought that I might never have lived.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Five. Four. Three. Two. One.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: 104\nCOMPUTER VOICE: SCENE 59. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM\nKLEIN: (SIGHS) And so it ends. The Moonbase destroyed, Earth not far behind it. A hundred years of prosperity, of progress. Of peace. My Golden Age.\nDOCTOR: It’s not quite over yet.\nKLEIN: I’m aware of that. Everything is prepared, I assume? Well, of course it is. You said it yourself in the Operations Centre. You made your plans well.\nDOCTOR: I never stopped hoping that there might be another way. I hoped that, perhaps, my alternative self might have found something.\nKLEIN: Tell me about Faber. While there’s still time. I want to... remember the time we had together. If I can.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Klein. I misled you. Faber was never here. I never saw him. As far as I know, you never went back for him.\nKLEIN: (LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY) You... you mean you lied to me?\nDOCTOR: I made you think about what you were doing to others. I made you ask yourself, how would you feel if it was done to you in return?\nKLEIN: ‘Right down to the last detail’. And that ‘detail’ was me. You played on my doubts, my dreams, because you knew they would lead me here.\nDOCTOR: I suspect you were right the first time. I think you were afraid. Afraid that, even if you could find Faber, it wouldn’t be the same between you. Afraid of tarnishing your memories, losing your past.\nKLEIN: You were right about me, Doctor. I don’t know what’s real any more.\nDOCTOR: (SADLY) You were tried in your absence, Klein, and convicted. This\nTARDIS: was configured to carry out your sentence. All I had to do was get you into this room, and push this button.\nTARDIS: 105\nKLEIN: And I will never have existed. I’m right, aren’t I? Executing me would never have been enough. I am to be erased from all time. Dematerialised.\nDOCTOR: You’re an anomaly, Klein. A refugee from a world that should never have been. A timeline that was born and died in the wink of an eye.\nKLEIN: But it did exist, didn’t it? It was real. And... and if I had never lived there... What then, Doctor? What if I had never taken that first journey, back to Colditz Castle? What if we had never met?\nDOCTOR: Would your timeline have become the primary one? Would the Nazis have won the Second World War?\nKLEIN: If you do this, if you push that button... With that single action, you could achieve everything I have ever desired. You could restore my world, my home. Of course, I will not be around to see it. Even so...\nDOCTOR: It might not work like that. Time has an amazing propensity for self-correction. If you’re not around to fulfil your part in history, it might cast somebody else in your role. Perhaps somebody less dangerous.\nKLEIN: But you don’t know, do you? You can’t be sure.\nDOCTOR: It could go either way. Your world or mine. I think we can agree, based on what we’ve just seen, that either would be an improvement.\nKLEIN: And whichever timeline wins out, you’d have no choice but to accept it. Because you wouldn’t dare intervene in the past directly. You couldn’t live with the consequences. (BEAT) I think I’m ready now.\nDOCTOR: There’s no hurry, Klein. We’re parked outside of time. Nothing can happen beyond those doors. You can take as long as you wish.\nKLEIN: (LAUGHS) Oh no, no, Doctor, you don’t get off the hook so easily. You don’t get to pretend that none of this is on your hands. This is what you were sent here to do. It’s your responsibility.\nKLEIN: 106\nDOCTOR: I can’t.\nKLEIN: I know you can. Push that button. End my life. Look at this way. I’m giving you an opportunity. A chance to see who you truly are.\nDOCTOR: There’s no way out of this for you, Klein. I can’t let you go. You’11l grow old in here. You’1ll die, and the world you leave behind will be one of desolation.\nKLEIN: Then you know what you have to do, Doctor. I can wait as long as it takes. As you said, we have no shortage of time.\nKLEIN: 107\nKLEIN: SCENE 60. UNIT HQ - LABORATORY\nKLEIN: You must be the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You recognise me?\nKLEIN: Not that particular face. But who else could you be? Who else would materialise a 1960s police box in the middle of a secure installation?\nDOCTOR: Who else indeed? I am in the right place, then?\nKLEIN: Has it changed so much in two years? Yes, Doctor, this is still UNIT. We’re still here. Fighting to keep the world safe.\nDOCTOR: For democracy?\nKLEIN: Something like that. I’m Doctor Elizabeth Klein, by the way. I’m... well, I suppose you could say I’m your replacement.\nDOCTOR: Elizabeth Klein... Yes, of course. Born in England to German parents, raised in a time of war. Gifted with an enquiring mind and a prodigious intellect, but also a need for order.\nKLEIN: Excuse me, have we.. have we met? I just thought... when you said my name, for a moment there...\nDOCTOR: In another life, perhaps. It can be hard, sometimes, to know what’s real and what only used to be.\nKLEIN: I think I do recognise you. Your description, at least, from a dozen old files. You were in Shoreditch in 1963, yes? Kenya in 1953. The Shangri-La holiday camp near Llandrudnod Wells in 1959.\nDOCTOR: And Colditz Castle, in 1944?\nKLEIN: Ah, yes. We thought that might be you too. So, to what do we owe the honour of this visit, Doctor? And should I be preparing for the worst?\nKLEIN: 108\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I haven’t brought the monsters with me this time. At least, none that I’m aware of. I just wanted to see how things were here, check that nothing is... well, out of place.\nKLEIN: I see. And have we passed inspection?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes, Doctor Klein, you most certainly have. It’s a beautiful\nDOCTOR: day. The sun is shining in the sky. The birds are singing in the trees. And everything is as it should be.\nDOCTOR: END\nDOCTOR: 109"
