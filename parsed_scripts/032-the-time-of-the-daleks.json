I wonder if I can trace it back to\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nCHARLEY: Not really, but don't worry about me.\nDOCTOR: You do look a little sickly though, with the pale cast of whatever.\nCHARLEY: I'd worry about yourself. I mean, what's this pale cast of whatever business?\nDOCTOR: I think we've already established that you're not a huge devotee of Shakespeare, judging by your less than enthusiastic response to my extremely clever tidal wave allusion.\nCHARLEY: Shakespeare?\nDOCTOR: To be or not to be.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, I haven't a clue what you're talking about. What is a Shakespeare?\nDOCTOR: Yes, very funny. Very ironic. You're serious, aren't you. What did they teach you at school? Did you never study Hamlet?\nCHARLEY: What, small villages?\nDOCTOR: Plays. Shakespeare. You know, Shake. Elizabethan playwright, quite popular in his day.\nCHARLEY: Oh, Doctor, you can't expect me to know all about the obscure people\nDOCTOR: Obscure?\nCHARLEY: You come across in your travels.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me.\nCHARLEY: I mean, if you'd quoted from Jonson or Marlowe\nDOCTOR: What?\nCHARLEY: Or a decent playwright of the time that people have actually heard of.\nDOCTOR: Charley, Charley, Charley. You mean to tell me that you know about Ben Jonson?\nCHARLEY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: And Kit Marlowe?\nCHARLEY: Well, of course.\nDOCTOR: But you've never heard of William Shakespeare.\nCHARLEY: Never.\nDOCTOR: That's fascinating. It's also quite, quite impossible.\nVIOLA: Has she started?\nFERDINAND: Shh. We're on air.\nBOY: On air?\nVIOLA: He means we must be quiet. Remember what I told you.\nBOY: Yes, Mistress Viola.\nVIOLA: Has she talked about the election?\nFERDINAND: She's coming to that.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: So I have to tell you that yesterday I went to the King and asked his permission to delay the elections.\nVIOLA: And you couldn't tell me that, Major Ferdinand. Oh, what has she done?\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Matter of time before the increasingly frenzied situation leads to violence and death. I have therefore decided to defer the elections.\nPRIESTLY: Learman can't do that! It's unconstitutional.\nHART: Oh, come on, Priestly. When has that ever bothered her?\nPRIESTLY: Well, Hart, we won't stop now. She can't maintain martial law for ever. We'll restore democracy to this country, and we'll get back Shakespeare.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Said in words far more appropriate than I ever could. This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, this earth of majesty\nVIOLA: Why can't she just hold the elections and retire gracefully?\nFERDINAND: She can't be seen to give in to them.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: This fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war. This happy breed of men\nVIOLA: Ironic that she should quote from Richard the Second.\nFERDINAND: You mean because most people have already forgotten Shakespeare?\nBOY: Richard the Second is about a ruler who is deposed.\nVIOLA: You should not know that.\nBOY: I'm sorry.\nVIOLA: And even if you do, you should not say it.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England!\nDOCTOR: You used to know about Shakespeare. I'd have noticed by now if. Orson Welles.\nCHARLEY: What about him?\nDOCTOR: He didn't know about Shakespeare either.\nCHARLEY: Oh, there you are, then. Nobody knows who he is except you.\nDOCTOR: Orson Welles made films of his plays. Not the most subtle of interpretations, but. Ah ha. Found it.\nCHARLEY: Found what, exactly?\nDOCTOR: A time fissure. A rent in the fabric of the Web of Time itself. Probably what gave us that buffeting as well. You see, it runs from the middle of the sixteenth century.\nCHARLEY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: It's the other way round. It ends in the sixteenth century but the rupture point is here, in the mid-twenty-first.\nCHARLEY: Does that matter?\nDOCTOR: Only if you worry about the difference between cause and effect.\nCHARLEY: So your Shakespeare disappeared down this crack in time?\nDOCTOR: Not yet, or I wouldn't remember him either. We need to drag him back into the real universe. Come on.\nCHARLEY: Where to?\nDOCTOR: New Britain, after the Euro-wars, during General Mariah Learman's benevolent dictatorship.\nCHARLEY: And when will we get there?\nCHARLEY: Ah.\nDOCTOR: After you, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: This way, I think.\nDOCTOR: It seems to be a main corridor. We need to identify the event that will start the rupture, then we stop it.\nFERDINAND: Hold it.\nDOCTOR: There'll be the usual misunderstandings, of course. Get locked up, escape, dice with death, get locked up again. That sort of thing.\nCHARLEY: Oh, you do surprise me.\nFERDINAND: We've been waiting.\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry, we were\nFERDINAND: Missed the speech. Couldn't get petrol, I suppose, with the blockade.\nDOCTOR: Something of the sort.\nFERDINAND: You know, General Learman isn't convinced this is a public relations problem. We keep our minds open.\nDOCTOR: Well, that's always a good start.\nFERDINAND: General Learman, ma'am. PR chap's here.\nLEARMAN: Good. Excellent. Wheel him in, Major.\nDOCTOR: Hello there.\nLEARMAN: Hastings, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: Oh please, just call me Doctor. And this is my associate, Miss Pollard.\nCHARLEY: How'd you do?\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Charley.\nLEARMAN: You heard the speech, I take it?\nDOCTOR: Well\nLEARMAN: So you know I've postponed the elections. Now we need to make that more palatable for the people.\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course it's never easy, is it, persuading people to swallow a dictatorship.\nLEARMAN: I know. Like medicine. The sooner we restore the democratic process, the better.\nCHARLEY: So why postpone?\nLEARMAN: We can't just cave in because they organise a few roadblocks and reckon we should talk to those Eurozone cretins.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well.\nLEARMAN: They're barely holding France, Italy and Germany together with their so-called single economy. The whole thing's plainly ludicrous.\nFERDINAND: It's only national pride that stops them admitting it.\nLEARMAN: That public relations battle was won as soon as I walked into the House of Commons and fired at the ceiling. You can't play at democracy. You can't ask the country for it's opinion then just ignore it like wanton boys dressed in a little brief authority.\nDOCTOR: Hmm, suppose not.\nFERDINAND: The rebels aren't widely supported.\nCHARLEY: So what's the problem?\nLEARMAN: Shakespeare, of course!\nDOCTOR: Of course. Shakespeare.\nLEARMAN: Thank God for that. For a moment I thought he'd been wiped from the table of your memory as well.\nTANNOY: [OC]: Attention please. Will Major Ferdinand please contact main gate.\nFERDINAND: Excuse me. Ferdinand here. Hang on. They say they have Marcus Hastings there.\nDOCTOR: Ah, that'll be er\nCHARLEY: Ramsey.\nDOCTOR: McCrimmon. Ramsey McCrimmon. Yes, insufferable name-dropper.\nCHARLEY: Insufferable.\nDOCTOR: What do you think, Miss Pollard? Do we need him on this one?\nCHARLEY: No. No! No, definitely not, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Mmm, that's what I thought. No, no, you can tell him we don't need him after all. He can go back to the office.\nFERDINAND: You're sure?\nDOCTOR: Yes. This all sounds pretty straight forward. An open and shut case of Shakespeare being taken out of time.\nLEARMAN: What did you say?\nHART: We lost Sarah Wilkinson this morning.\nPRIESTLY: Nothing?\nHART: Not a trace. She didn't recognise the standard quotes at all.\nPRIESTLY: It's getting worse.\nHART: Do you really think it's Learman? Can it really be something she's done?\nPRIESTLY: Well, what else could it be?\nHART: Well, maybe, maybe she's trying to save Shakespeare?\nPRIESTLY: What?\nHART: Well, like we are.\nPRIESTLY: Oh, sure. And maybe the Eurozone countries won't go bankrupt. Free Will. Remember that.\nHART: I know, I know. But it's difficult sometimes. Especially at night.\nPRIESTLY: Yes. When the nightmares come.\nLEARMAN: What gossip have you been listening to?\nDOCTOR: Well, perhaps the best approach would be if you were to tell us how you see the situation.\nCHARLEY: Yes, er, give us your assessment.\nFERDINAND: Will you excuse me, ma'am?\nLEARMAN: Yes, yes, you cut along. Oh, er, you don't know where my niece is, do you, Ferdinand? I suppose the Doctor ought to hear her opinions, however outrageous they may be.\nFERDINAND: I believe she went to the library.\nLEARMAN: Then so shall we.\nLEARMAN: The rebels think I'm somehow responsible for people forgetting Shakespeare. Oh brave New Britain that has such people in it.\nDOCTOR: Very impressive.\nLEARMAN: My library. (door closes) Well, the nation's library, strictly speaking.\nVIOLA: Aunt Mariah?\nLEARMAN: Ah, Viola. Doctor Hastings and Miss Pollard are here to help us with our Shakespearean problem.\nBOY: Mistress?\nVIOLA: Shh. Go along to the kitchens. They'll want help.\nLEARMAN: Before you go, get me down the Folio, would you?\nBOY: Folio?\nLEARMAN: That book I asked you for the other day? Large, leather bound?\nBOY: Yes, ma'am.\nLEARMAN: I don't know why you keep that boy on. His mind is a very opal.\nVIOLA: He's here to learn.\nDOCTOR: Well, aren't we all?\nBOY: This on, ma'am?\nLEARMAN: Yes, that's it. Well done, lad. You can go now.\nVIOLA: But remember what I told you.\nBOY: Yes, mistress. I remember.\nDOCTOR: An original Folio?\nLEARMAN: Indeed.\nDOCTOR: Look, Charley. The first collected plays of Shakespeare. Feel the history behind that. Look at the way the ink has faded, the pages yellowed.\nCHARLEY: But this still exists. Does that mean there's no real problem?\nVIOLA: Whole communities forgetting our national heritage? And now these dreams and memories of a past that never happened. There's a real problem all right.\nDOCTOR: I'm sorry, I've not heard of that.\nLEARMAN: Such stuff as dreams are made on. I did wonder if the rebels are using some form of collective hypnosis.\nCHARLEY: To take Shakespeare out of time?\nMARIAN: You used that phrase before. Are you suggesting we give some credence to the rebel claims?\nVIOLA: It's about time someone did.\nDOCTOR: You don't agree with your aunt's assessment?\nLEARMAN: Of course she doesn't, any more than she thinks I should stand up to the rebels.\nVIOLA: What do you think, Doctor? About Shakespeare.\nDOCTOR: I think he was the most accomplished, talented and influential playwright who ever drew breath. I think his prose is peerless, his sonnets sensational, and his blank verse beguiling.\nLEARMAN: Got some sense in that head of yours then.\nDOCTOR: I think his disappearance from history is a symptom of something far more\nDOCTOR: dangerous and insidious. A fracture in Time itself.\nLEARMAN: But if Time itself has changed, how can we be aware of it?\nDOCTOR: Thus far, Shakespeare's removal from history is only a possibility, but it's rapidly becoming a probability. As the chance of it really happening increases, so more people forget.\nCHARLEY: And as that becomes more probable, so it becomes more tangible?\nDOCTOR: Mmm, but the main event that will cause it hasn't happened yet. It's just a possible event for the moment, becoming inexorably more certain with every second that passes.\nLEARMAN: But what enterprise of such pith and moment could have that effect.\nDOCTOR: I don't know. But it will happen soon and it will happen here. It's interesting that you don't immediately dismiss my suggestion as utter nonsense.\nCHARLEY: A refreshing change.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, why do the rebels think you might be to blame?\nLEARMAN: Because of my experiments with time travel.\nOSRIC: I need another power supply. Get one from the stores, would you? I'd send the boy, but he's never around when you need him. Not that he's any more talkative than you two. Ah, that was quick. Oh, it's you, General.\nCHARLEY: So many clocks and mirrors. They go on forever. What is it?\nLEARMAN: Our time machine. Doctor, Miss Pollard, let me introduce Professor Osric.\nDOCTOR: Which is the real you? With so many mirrors, it's difficult to tell what's a reflection and what's reality.\nOSRIC: Which is, of course, the point. Doctor of what, may I ask?\nDOCTOR: Oh, everything, really. This is impressive, to say the least. You must have over a hundred mirrors in here, and I hate to think how many clocks.\nLEARMAN: There are one hundred and eleven mirrors, and over sixteen hundred clocks.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Could I just ask, why? I mean, how does it work?\nDOCTOR: More to the point, does it work?\nOSRIC: The theory holds. Every step forwards is according to our predictions.\nDOCTOR: I take it that means no.\nOSRIC: Er.\nLEARMAN: Another reason why I cannot be held responsible for taking Shakespeare out of time, as you put it.\nDOCTOR: If this time machine does one day work, that may be when whatever happens, happens.\nOSRIC: What is he talking about?\nCHARLEY: I still don't understand how it's suppose to work.\nDOCTOR: Orthopositronium, I suppose.\nOSRIC: How do you know that? You told him.\nLEARMAN: (laughs) No, indeed. And you're right, Doctor. Every archway, every alcove in this room has a mirror in it. In addition, there are the free-standing mirrors and those arranged on the walls and the ceiling.\nOSRIC: Since light travels to the mirror and back to the observer, what it shows is actually an image of the past. The very recent past, but still the past.\nDOCTOR: And you use mirror matter. The mirrors are coated with orthopositronium.\nCHARLEY: With what?\nDOCTOR: It's a substance in which the electron and the positron orbit each other in the same direction.\nCHARLEY: Oh, of course.\nOSRIC: This enables us to open a portal into the mirror universe, a realm where light travels at a different speed.\nDOCTOR: Just as it travels slower through water, so it travels more quickly through your mirror universe.\nLEARMAN: Exactly, Doctor. In theory.\nDOCTOR: But, it doesn't work, does it.\nOSRIC: Er, not yet.\nDOCTOR: Not ever. To open the portal you need to stabilise the mirror universe in relation to our own.\nLEARMAN: You're right, of course, Doctor. And that is what the clocks are for.\nVIOLA: Priestly? Hart? Are you there?\nHART: Over here, Viola.\nVIOLA: Oh, you don't have to hide. Nobody knows you're here.\nPRIESTLY: And what if your charming aunt sends patrols into the grounds to hunt us down?\nVIOLA: She isn't like that. She's doing what she believes is right.\nHART: Tell that to the people whose memories have faded. We've got weapons, but if we delay\nVIOLA: Now listen to me. I might still persuade her to hold elections, despite your half-hearted blockades and ill-conceived civil actions.\nPRIESTLY: I thought we had your support?\nVIOLA: For restoring democracy, yes. And the best way is to sit tight and do nothing.\nHART: And what about Shakespeare?\nVIOLA: I don't know.\nHART: What is it, Viola?\nVIOLA: There's a new man at the palace. A doctor. I think he may be able to sort it out, unlike those. There's something about him.\nLEARMAN: You are familiar with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle?\nDOCTOR: That the very act of measuring something changes its nature, yes.\nCHARLEY: Me too. Now, at least.\nLEARMAN: To observe it is to change it. We are applying that principle to time itself.\nOSRIC: A clock, merely by counting off the seconds, disturbs, changes time.\nLEARMAN: Think what almost two thousand clocks in a confined space will do.\nDOCTOR: But how do you keep control? You want to create an image, I assume, in that large mirror. An image of the past, since it's the passing of time that the clocks measure.\nOSRIC: There is a Master Clock over there.\nCHARLEY: The silver carriage clock?\nLEARMAN: A clock to which we have slaved to Time itself.\nOSRIC: Change that clock, and you set the point in time displayed. Next we shall open up the portal, so we can walk through it into the past.\nCHARLEY: And what do you see in the mirror?\nLEARMAN: At the moment, nothing.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) They need a source of chronons to act as a temporal stabiliser.\nOSRIC: But once this panel is fixed, it will work again.\nDOCTOR: Er, again?\nLEARMAN: About a month ago, it worked for a short time. Then, it stopped.\nOSRIC: Tonight we shall be ready.\nCHARLEY: For what?\nLEARMAN: To witness the first ever performance of Julius Caesar.\nDOCTOR: Fifteen hundred and ninety nine. An interesting choice. Though without a source of chronons, I don't see how\nLEARMAN: What do you know about chronons?\nDOCTOR: Without time travel you don't get chronons, and without chronons you can't have time travel. It's a classic chicken and egg paradox.\nOSRIC: When the mirror worked, it showed us, brought us, help.\nDOCTOR: Help?\nLEARMAN: This endeavour is not mine alone. It is a partnership.\nOSRIC: They appeared from the mirror, came through it into our world and time.\nLEARMAN: The most enthusiastic of Shakespearean scholars, come to ensure the success of our enterprise.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, what's wrong?\nDOCTOR: These partners who bring you the secrets of time travel\nDALEK: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I should have known.\nVIOLA: I must get back.\nPRIESTLY: Keep in contact. You know the frequency.\nVIOLA: Just don't do anything rash while I'm away.\nDALEK: The Daleks venerate Shakespeare.\nDALEK: 2: He is the greatest playwright in the universe.\nDOCTOR: I never thought I'd hear a Dalek say something I actually agree with.\nCHARLEY: You know them, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not as Shakespearean scholars, sadly.\nDALEK: The Daleks have many strengths.\nLEARMAN: I have to say that's true. Ferdinand tells me they've made some excellent suggestions to improve palace security.\nDOCTOR: I'll bet they have.\nDALEK: 2: Power supply connected to panel. Chronon level reaching optimum.\nDALEK: Master Clock will require one hour to reach full charge.\nLEARMAN: Then at last we will witness one of Shakespeare's triumphs.\nDOCTOR: Learman, you have to stop this.\nLEARMAN: What?\nDOCTOR: I don't know what they're up to, but this isn't about Shakespeare.\nLEARMAN: Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. Here, in one hour. Come to the performance.\nDOCTOR: Performance? We shall see.\nDALEK: 'Tis now the very witching time of night.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: I need to think.\nDALEK: 2: When churchyards yawn\nDOCTOR: Keep an eye on things, Charley.\nDALEK: 2: And hell itself breaths out contagion to this world.\nDOCTOR: I have to work out what's going on. This is why we're here, Charley.\nDALEK: Now could I drink hot blood\nDOCTOR: In one hour somehow we face the beginning of the end of the world.\nCHARLEY: Why are you so worried? It's not like these Daleks are going around killing anyone.\nDOCTOR: It isn't, and that's what worries me most.\nVIOLA: Doctor? Wait a moment.\nDOCTOR: I was looking for the library. I usually have an excellent sense of direction, but I am a bit distracted.\nVIOLA: It's this way. (walking) They do have that effect, don't they. The Daleks.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you've met them, then.\nVIOLA: They appeared from nowhere, and have just what Aunt Mariah needs for her quixotic quest. I don't trust them, but nobody listens to me.\nDOCTOR: Frustrating, isn't it.\nVIOLA: Don't get me wrong. I think saving Shakespeare is a good cause. But I'd rather get the country sorted out first. What's past is past.\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately, what's past is still very present.\nVIOLA: She did it for the right reasons, you know. She was the people's heroine.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nVIOLA: She just can't let go. Once she's started something, she has to finish it. Well, that's not wrong, is it?\nDOCTOR: No, not in itself. It's very difficult doing what's best when both sides are absolutely right.\nVIOLA: I just. I just don't want everything to end up as it is in the nightmares.\nDOCTOR: Tell me about the nightmares.\nVIOLA: A world of conformity. No individuals. Just a mass of humanity following orders. A world where there's no thought, no imagination, no love.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nVIOLA: The library, Doctor. I'll leave you now. But, do you know what the nightmare is?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid I do. It is the past, the present and the future. Unless I can stop the Daleks.\nBOY: I'm sorry, I\nDOCTOR: Don't mind me, don't mind me.\nBOY: I'm not supposed to come here. I have to keep out of the way.\nDOCTOR: Not out of my way, you don't. Go on reading.\nBOY: Thank you. I like reading.\nDOCTOR: He who loves reading has everything within his reach. Who said that? Godwin? Never mind.\nDOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened.\nDALEK: 2: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, it's you. I was wrong. Be frightened. Be very frightened. And what do you want? Come to revise the text for tonight's performance?\nDALEK: The performance will proceed as planned.\nDOCTOR: You're not interested in Shakespeare. What are you really up to? Can I guess?\nDALEK: We defy augury.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, you can drop the pretence. I mean, we're all enemies here. You don't think I can stop you, is that it?\nDALEK: The readiness is all.\nDOCTOR: I couldn't agree more. And you should know I love a challenge.\nDALEK: Doctor? Be careful. Be careful.\nLEARMAN: You will be joining us, won't you?\nFERDINAND: Shakespeare isn't really my sort of thing, ma'am, as you know. But for such an auspicious occasion.\nCHARLEY: It's all right. We'll sit at the back.\nLEARMAN: Good. Excellent. How long now?\nDALEK: 2: Data suggests an image will form in approximately eleven minutes.\nOSRIC: Yes, I'd agree with that.\nLEARMAN: Just time for you to find Viola. She'll want to see this.\nFERDINAND: Of course, ma‘am.\nOSRIC: Oh, where have you been?\nDALEK: Refreshments are prepared. Liquid is available.\nCHARLEY: I'm rather partial to those cheesy pineapple things. (sotto) I wish the Doctor would come back.\nBOY: Sir? Sir?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? What is it?\nBOY: You've been silent and still a long time, sir. I was worried.\nDOCTOR: Have I? How long?\nBOY: I don't know. Time goes on crutches till interest takes it up.\nDOCTOR: How can a Shakespearean play? Pass me that Folio, would you? Thank you. The answer must be in here somewhere.\nBOY: It is the same book, sir. I swear it.\nDOCTOR: You're sure?\nBOY: Yes, but where's the writing gone? It's just blank pages.\nDOCTOR: Airy nothing. Melted into air like the baseless fabric of a vision.\nBOY: What does it mean? What can it portend?\nDOCTOR: It means I'm probably too late.\nDOCTOR: And it portends the end of the world.\nDALEK: 2: Image established.\nCHARLEY: It's like mist.\nLEARMAN: Now we see into the dead past.\nOSRIC: Was Shakespeare himself in this one? Adjust temporal flow.\nCHARLEY: It's clearing.\nFERDINAND: There are people sitting on the stage.\nLEARMAN: Anthony's speech in Act Three!\nLEARMAN: (Distorted performance in the background all but obliterated by the dialogue. Possibly Mark Anthony's soliloquy starting O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth.)\nDALEK: Contact established.\nLEARMAN: Be quiet over there. Oh, couldn't you have caught the beginning, Osric?\nDOCTOR: Stop this. You have to stop it now.\nDALEK: Full integrity in eight Rels.\nLEARMAN: Are you mad, Doctor? Look at it! My achievement.\nDOCTOR: Shut it down.\nDALEK: Five Rels.\nLEARMAN: Be quiet, I said.\nDOCTOR: Shut it down, Osric.\nLEARMAN: Don't listen to him.\nDALEK: Three Rels.\nCHARLEY: Do as he says.\nDOCTOR: I'll do it myself.\nLEARMAN: Get him away from there, Ferdinand. Screw your courage to the sticking place, man!\nFERDINAND: Come on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Have to disconnect it!\nCHARLEY: Ferdinand, he may be right.\nDALEK: Full integrity. Time corridor forming,\nDALEK: 2: Link to ship established.\nLEARMAN: What's happened? What have you done?\nCHARLEY: It's all misty again.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, we're too late.\nDALEK: Time portal forming.\nLEARMAN: It's clearing.\nFERDINAND: It looks like a corridor.\nCHARLEY: A corridor of mist.\nDOCTOR: Down!\nCHARLEY: But there's no glass.\nDOCTOR: Time rupture!\nLEARMAN: What say you?\nDOCTOR: They're coming through a hole in the fabric of Time itself!\nLEARMAN: What are?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks!\nDALEKS: (multiple overlapping voices merging into one) We are the Masters of Time. We are the Masters of Time. We are the Masters of Time. We are the Masters of Time!"

I assume our agreement still stands?\nDOCTOR: I think all bets are off, don't you?\nDALEK: Our terms remain unchanged. Shakespeare will be restored.\nCHARLEY: Why are they playing along?\nDOCTOR: They still need something from Learman. I'd advise you not to trust them.\nLEARMAN: I'll thank you to keep your own counsel, Doctor.\nDALEK: The Doctor is known to the Daleks. He will assist with the construction of the temporal stabiliser.\nDOCTOR: So that's what you're after!\nDALEK: Search all areas.\nDALEK: 2: Security squad gamma to proceed to outer perimeter. Squad alpha now in control of lower floor of palace.\nDALEK: 3: Squad epsilon has encountered resistance in barracks area.\nDALEK: All extraneous human personnel will be exterminated.\nDALEK: 3: I understand.\nDALEK: Dalek battle commander to all sections. Palace security will be maintained. All non-essential humans are to be exterminated. Destroy all resistance.\nDALEKS: [OC]: Exterminate! Encountering resistance.\nDOCTOR: So what's this agreement, Learman?\nLEARMAN: A simple bargain, Doctor. Their ship has run aground in the time vortex, I have offered them facilities to repair it.\nOSRIC: You never told me that.\nCHARLEY: In return for what?\nLEARMAN: Shakespeare, what else?\nDOCTOR: I can't believe they just want to repair their ship.\nDALEK: We require a temporal stabiliser to restore our ship's function. In return, we will complete this time travel facility.\nDOCTOR: Hardly an inconvenience, since you'll have to get it working to create a temporal stabiliser.\nDALEK: You will assist in the creation of the stabiliser.\nDOCTOR: And if I do, you'll let Learman here sort out Shakespeare and then just go home to Skaro?\nDALEK: Agreed.\nDOCTOR: All right, then, I'll do it.\nLEARMAN: Good. Excellent. Now, I'd better get back to my office. Major Ferdinand? You're with me.\nDALEK: You may go.\nDOCTOR: And if I'm to help, I need to read up on a few things. The library seems a good place to start. Charley, Viola, I'd welcome your help.\nDALEK: Escort the Doctor and his companions to the library.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nCHARLEY: (sotto) Do you trust them, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Oh, Charley, where's your faith? Of course I don't trust them. Not one millionth of one millionth of an inch.\nDALEK: Chronon source detected in palace.\nDALEK: 2: Data suggests it is the Master Clock.\nDALEK: The Master Clock will form the core of a temporal stabiliser.\nDALEK: 2: A replacement Temporal Extinction Device is now being prepared.\nDALEK: Satisfactory. We still require power to refuel our timonic engines.\nDALEK: 2: Security squad gamma reports that the palace draws energy from a nuclear reactor. This will serve our needs.\nDALEK: Dalek victory over Time is assured.\nLEARMAN: Ferdinand, why so vexed? We have a bargain.\nFERDINAND: They won't let me near the barracks, and I've not seen a single guardsman.\nLEARMAN: You're a soldier. You know they can maintain security better than our men.\nFERDINAND: Hmm. It's a strange partnership where they do all the work and we get all the reward.\nLEARMAN: Be thankful the balance is in our favour.\nFERDINAND: I don't trust it. Unless.\nLEARMAN: Unless what?\nFERDINAND: Tell me, ma'am. Is there more to your agreement than I know?\nLEARMAN: Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries?\nFERDINAND: Ma'am?\nLEARMAN: A question not to be asked, Major Ferdinand. A question not to be asked.\nCHARLEY: Perhaps it was always blank.\nVIOLA: No. I've looked at it a thousand times. My aunt has pored over these pages over and over again.\nDOCTOR: We saw it, Charley, and what's his name, the boy? He was surprised too.\nVIOLA: He shouldn't be reading it.\nDOCTOR: Too good for the likes of him, huh?\nVIOLA: That would be my aunt's opinion.\nCHARLEY: There's something very unnerving about those Daleks. Look at the one by the door. It's never still. Moving, twitching, watching.\nVIOLA: Like nervous energy. As if the machine was actually alive.\nDOCTOR: It is. Or rather, the creature that sits within and controls it is.\nCHARLEY: Inside? What's this creature like?\nDOCTOR: Think of your worst nightmare. Think of the most repellent, disgusting, nauseating thing you can possibly imagine. Think of pure evil made malignant flesh.\nVIOLA: And that's what it's like?\nDOCTOR: No. It's a thousand times worse.\nCHARLEY: So why are they here?\nDOCTOR: I don't know, but it certainly isn't to save Shakespeare.\nCHARLEY: Is there something here they want, they need?\nVIOLA: The time travel experiments, perhaps? If they really are shipwrecked, as they say.\nDOCTOR: Yes, if. The Master Clock will allow them a degree of control over the time vortex\nDOCTOR: that exceeds anything they already possess, if it works.\nVIOLA: It brought them here.\nDOCTOR: It brought them out of the vortex, and it allowed us to see the past in the mirror. But a working two way portal between temporal zones is rather more complicated.\nVIOLA: It will happen, though.\nCHARLEY: How'd you know?\nVIOLA: Well, we have to assume it will, don't we?\nDOCTOR: Always assume the worst. Very wise, especially where the Daleks are involved.\nVIOLA: I er, I have to go. Will you excuse me?\nDOCTOR: It isn't us you have to ask.\nDALEK: 2: Wait.\nVIOLA: I have to go. Let me pass.\nDALEK: 2: You will remain here until the Doctor has completed his research.\nVIOLA: I will not.\nDALEK: 2: Return to the others now.\nVIOLA: My aunt has asked me to join her. I have to see General Learman.\nDALEK: 2: Very well. You may proceed.\nCHARLEY: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: It's a few minutes work to rig up the clock to act as a temporal stabiliser they can use.\nCHARLEY: So?\nDOCTOR: So we have to make it take rather longer.\nCHARLEY: How much longer?\nDOCTOR: As long as we need to find out what's going on. Until then we have to keep the Daleks trapped here.\nCHARLEY: With us?\nDALEK: 2: Outgoing communication detected.\nDALEK: 3: Carrier wave intercepted.\nDALEK: Relay to main speakers.\nDALEK: 3: Adjusting frequency.\nDALEK: Locate source of transmission. Dispatch a security squad to the area.\nDALEK: 2: Triangulating. Transmission emanating from within residential area of palace.\nVIOLA: I'll tell you when I see you. For the moment just\nVIOLA: Oh, my God!\nDALEK: Transmission source located. Drop the communicator.\nDALEK: [OC]: Exterminate the dissident human.\nVIOLA: No. I'm Learman's niece!\nDALEK: [OC]: Exterminate!\nDALEK: Communications device destroyed. You are a prisoner of the Daleks. Do you\nDALEK: understand?\nVIOLA: Yes. Yes, I understand.\nDALEK: 3: Any attempt to resist will result in your immediate extermination.\nDALEK: Follow!\nPRIESTLY: Viola? Viola!\nPRIESTLY: Nothing. Gone.\nHART: What happened, Priestly?\nPRIESTLY: An explosion. Voices, sort of metallic, then nothing.\nHART: Is she dead?\nPRIESTLY: I don't know, Hart.\nHART: Did she tell you what's going on in there?\nPRIESTLY: She said it was time to act. Get everyone ready and give me that gun. Let's go and get her out of there.\nDOCTOR: I think we've hung round here long enough.\nCHARLEY: We're off, then?\nDOCTOR: Back to the Hall of Clocks and Mirrors, I think.\nDOCTOR: I still don't really understand why the Master Clock works. We're off to examine the Master Clock. Would you care to join us, or do you have some reading to do?\nDALEK: 2: I will accompany you.\nDOCTOR: Not a great scholar of literature, then? Well, let's not stand upon the order of our going, but go at once.\nCHARLEY: More Shakespeare?\nDOCTOR: Macbeth.\nDALEK: 2: Act Four, Scene Three.\nCHARLEY: Showoff. What else do you know?\nDALEK: 2: Blood will have blood.\nDALEK: 3: Move. Move!\nVIOLA: All right, all right, I'm moving.\nDALEK: 3: Halt.\nVIOLA: Oh, make up your mind.\nDALEK: 3: Lifeforms detected in corridor.\nVIOLA: (sotto) Oh no, Priestly.\nDALEK: 3: Humans sighted. Halt! Halt!\nPRIESTLY: What the hell?\nVIOLA: Priestly, Hart, all of you.\nDALEK: 3: Exterminate!\nVIOLA: Run! Get out of here!\nDALEK: 3: Exterminate!\nPRIESTLY: Viola, move away. Get away from them, Viola.\nDALEK: 3: Unauthorised humans will surrender.\nPRIESTLY: Us surrender? No. You're outnumbered and outgunned.\nDALEK: 3: Exterminate!\nCHARLEY: That's ahead of us, near the hall.\nDALEK: 2: Remain here.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Charley. Let's have a look.\nDALEK: 2: Remain here!\nDOCTOR: We're remaining, we're remaining.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, look. Two more of them.\nDOCTOR: They look a bit twitchy, don't they?\nDALEK: 4: Report.\nDALEK: 5: Rebel forces attempting to liberate Viola Learman.\nDALEK: 4: Forces now dispersed. We must locate and destroy them.\nDALEK: 5: Understood.\nDALEK: 4: Seek, locate, exterminate. (moves away, chanting.)\nCHARLEY: Where is Viola?\nDALEK: 2: She will be apprehended with all speed. You will come with me. Move.\nDOCTOR: We obey. (sotto) If we have a chance, try to get Viola away to safety.\nCHARLEY: If I have a chance, I'll get myself away to safety.\nDOCTOR: That's the spirit.\nVIOLA: Listen to me. Hart, Priestly, take your people and get out of here.\nPRIESTLY: Viola.\nVIOLA: Go on! It's me they want.\nHART: Where are you going?\nVIOLA: I'm going to get the clock.\nPRIESTLY: Good luck.\nVIOLA: I'll see you later. Now go!\nDALEK: 3 [OC]: Rebel forces located. Pursue and exterminate.\nPRIESTLY: More of them.\nHART: Come on, Priestly!\nDALEK: 3: Viola Learman located. Assist.\nVIOLA: Now, let's see just how fast you can move.\nOSRIC: Viola.\nVIOLA: Quickly, Osric. Where's the Master Clock?\nOSRIC: It's over there, on the\nDALEK: 2: Do not move.\nVIOLA: No. You do not move. See what I have here?\nDALEK: 2: (panicked) You are holding the Master Clock!\nVIOLA: Any closer and I'll smash the clock. And if you shoot, you'll destroy it.\nDOCTOR: In here, Charley.\nCHARLEY: Viola! What's happening?\nDALEK: 2: You will surrender the Master Clock.\nVIOLA: No, I won't.\nDALEK: 2: You will surrender the Master Clock or we will exterminate these humans.\nCHARLEY: Oh, great.\nPRIESTLY: This way! Come on. Major Ferdinand.\nFERDINAND: Put the gun down, Priestly.\nPRIESTLY: Why? Because you'll shoot me before I can use it, when there are ten men here who will kill you right afterwards?\nFERDINAND: No. Because I think we're both on the same side, and you only have seven men.\nPRIESTLY: What?\nFERDINAND: The quickest way out is through there. I'll try and delay them.\nPRIESTLY: Thank you.\nFERDINAND: I wish I could say it was a pleasure.\nVIOLA: Kill anyone and I'll destroy the clock.\nDALEK: Prepare to exterminate the young human female.\nDOCTOR: You harm Charley and you forfeit my help. And Osric here has expertise we'll need as well.\nBOY: Mistress, I heard\nVIOLA: No! No! Get away from here!\nDALEK: Remain where you are.\nDALEK: 2: The young human male will be exterminated unless you surrender.\nBOY: Mistress\nVIOLA: You can't!\nDALEK: 2: Immediately!\nDALEK: Move away from the mirror!\nVIOLA: The boy. Make sure they don't harm him.\nDOCTOR: We'll make sure.\nCHARLEY: The image in the mirror, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: She's linked it to the clock.\nCHARLEY: It looks like an old street, half-timbered buildings.\nDOCTOR: Don't do anything rash, Viola.\nDALEK: 2: You have five seconds to surrender. Five, four\nCHARLEY: Here, let me take that.\nVIOLA: No, Charley. You have to get away.\nDALEK: 2: Two, one.\nCHARLEY: Viola, what are you?\nDALEK: Master Clock activated! Time portal forming.\nDOCTOR: Charley, get away from the mirror!\nDALEK: 2: Portal closing. Humans escaping.\nDALEK: Emergency! The Master Clock has been removed from this temporal location.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Charley, Charley. When have you gone now?\nCHARLEY: Where are we?\nVIOLA: Oh, sets your teeth on edge, doesn't it? Come on, this way.\nCHARLEY: What?\nVIOLA: They can still see us in the mirror. I'll carry the clock, if you don't mind.\nCHARLEY: You know where and when we are, don't you. You brought us here deliberately.\nDALEK: 2: Spatial offset approximately one hundred miles.\nOSRIC: She managed to change the geographical location.\nBOY: I know where that is.\nDOCTOR: A hundred miles from London, apparently, but it's the date that's more interesting, I think.\nDALEK: Temporal offset calculated. They have travelled to the year one five seven two.\nBOY: 1572?\nDOCTOR: Yes. A strange choice. Still, it does tell us one thing.\nOSRIC: And what it that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That the Master Clock works.\nCHARLEY: Look, so where and when are we?\nVIOLA: It's 1572, and since relative locations don't change, we're about half a mile away from where we need to be.\nCHARLEY: But we're trapped here now. We can't get back except through the mirror.\nVIOLA: Except through a mirror. And on September the nineteenth 1572, at about this time and about half a mile this way, there's the entrance to another mirror.\nCHARLEY: Another? Well, leading where?\nVIOLA: To a small outbuilding on the edge of the palace grounds.\nCHARLEY: How do you know all this?\nBOY: Is this what you wanted?\nOSRIC: Ah, thank you. But without the Master Clock, we can't stabilise a portal.\nDOCTOR: That's not strictly true. We need a stabiliser, but it doesn't have to be a clock, theoretically.\nOSRIC: Theoretically won't get them back.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, theoretically none of this ridiculous set up should work at all.\nDALEK: 2: You will design a short term temporal stabiliser to enable recovery of the Master Clock.\nDOCTOR: We need to synchronise the other clocks to the main controls. Can you link them to that chronostat and set its output to analogue rather than particle?\nOSRIC: That should be possible. You, boy, come over here and give me a hand.\nDOCTOR: Good. I need peace and quiet to think this through.\nDALEK: Follow me.\nDOCTOR: Going to find me a cosy cubby-hole somewhere, are you? I'll just collect a few bits and pieces I want to look at, if you don't mind.\nDALEK: You will remain here until the design work is complete.\nDOCTOR: Very cosy, thank you.\nFERDINAND: Hello, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So, they got you, too. Nice office you have here, Major Ferdinand.\nFERDINAND: They think I helped the rebels escape, so they're keeping me here.\nDOCTOR: You're lucky they didn't just exterminate you. You have a nice large mirror over the mantelpiece, I see.\nFERDINAND: Yeah, it is just a mirror.\nDOCTOR: For the moment. But I have a few bits and bobs can change that.\nFERDINAND: You're going to change it into a time machine?\nDOCTOR: Nothing so complicated. This little chap should home in on one of the mirrors in the Hall. So, if we slot this in here, and attach that.\nFERDINAND: They've gone! Our reflections. The mirror's gone blank.\nDOCTOR: We should see something. Let me just.\nFERDINAND: Careful, you'll smash it. No, no, that's it. It's clearing. It's\nDOCTOR: The time corridor. But with no temporal displacement, so there's no need to stabilise it, you see.\nFERDINAND: Er, no.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now, pull that chair over and we should be able to climb through into the Hall, mirror to mirror.\nFERDINAND: As simple as that?\nDOCTOR: Well, we have to hope there isn't a Dalek waiting on the other side. Now be careful when you climb up onto the mantelpiece. It's a little bit narrow. Argh!\nFERDINAND: Doctor! Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Yes, yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm. Wait a minute, this isn't the Hall. Where on Earth am I?\nFERDINAND: Hold on. I'm coming through.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Good. Oh. And just who might you be?\nLEARMAN: Where the rebels are concerned, I'm happy to give you a free (pause) hand, as it were.\nDALEK: Satisfactory. We have located a secondary temporal energy source close to this location.\nLEARMAN: You think it might be the rebels?\nDALEK: We will monitor any transmissions.\nLEARMAN: Perhaps that's how they're getting to Shakespeare.\nDALEK: Any threat to the security of this facility will be eliminated.\nLEARMAN: Then our interests overlap. Good. Excellent.\nDALEK: Viola Learman has caused considerable disruption.\nLEARMAN: I may be her aunt, but as mine honour is my life, I cannot be held responsible for her actions.\nDALEK: The Master Clock will be recovered from the Elizabethan time zone. Quantum fluctuations in that temporal location confirm Dalek supremacy.\nLEARMAN: And Shakespeare?\nDALEK: Our agreement stands.\nVIOLA: The outbuilding is where Priestly and his rebels have set up their headquarters.\nCHARLEY: You know about the rebels?\nVIOLA: I've been trying to keep them at bay while I persuade Aunt Mariah to step down.\nCHARLEY: So the rebels have their own mirror, and it just happens to be pointing here and now, pretty much?\nVIOLA: That's right.\nCHARLEY: Do you want to explain that at all?\nVIOLA: It's quite simple, Charley. You see, what\nCHARLEY: Quick, back here. Into the bushes.\nVIOLA: What is it?\nCHARLEY: Shh. Look.\nVIOLA: How did they get here? And what are they doing with those people?\nDALEK: All able bodied humans will be assigned to labour force seven. Move. Move!\nDALEK: 2: Weak female human lagging behind.\nCHARLEY: Maybe they didn't follow us.\nVIOLA: What do you mean?\nDALEK: Dalek central control in London orders that the weakest workers will be exterminated to increase efficiency.\nCHARLEY: Perhaps they've been here for a while. Perhaps they've always been here.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nVIOLA: We have to help her.\nCHARLEY: We can't!\nCHARLEY: Remember what the Doctor said about history being changed? What you said about dreams of a different past?\nVIOLA: You mean, the Daleks have changed history?\nCHARLEY: Yes. Changed it so they have always been the rulers of Earth.\nVIOLA: I think they've gone.\nCHARLEY: Ow. I don't want to do that again. I had a bramble sticking in my leg.\nVIOLA: It's this way. Come on.\nDALEK: Halt! Human females are required at the main Warwick compound. Join that labour force. Move.\nVIOLA: What do we do?\nCHARLEY: Run!\nDALEK: Halt! Halt! Halt or you will be exterminated!\nDALEK: ?? 21.55 humans escaping. In pursuit. Assist! Assist!\nDOCTOR: This is excellent. You have your own mirror portal.\nPRIESTLY: It doesn't work. Hasn't for a month or more.\nDOCTOR: But it did before?\nFERDINAND: You've been hidden away in this outbuilding for over a month? I admire your cheek if nothing else, Priestly.\nDOCTOR: I thought I'd focused on one of the mirrors in the Hall. This is much better. If only I had a way of linking this mirror to 1572.\nPRIESTLY: It's already linked to 1572, but it doesn't work.\nDOCTOR: It is? What a stroke of luck.\nFERDINAND: Really?\nDOCTOR: Yes, really. We don't need to recalibrate. Must be something in amongst this lot that will help get it working.\nFERDINAND: You're right. Something's happening.\nDOCTOR: It's clearing.\nFERDINAND: Looks like someone hammering on the back of the glass.\nVIOLA: [OC]: Priestly! Priestly, are you there? Let us through!\nCHARLEY: [OC]: There are Daleks outside. They'll be here any minute. Do you want me to\nCHARLEY: help?\nVIOLA: [OC]: No, keep watch. I'll keep trying the mirror. Can anyone hear me?\nPRIESTLY: Viola?\nDOCTOR: Charley!\nPRIESTLY: They're stuck on the other side.\nDOCTOR: Without another Master Clock, it's just like a sheet of glass.\nFERDINAND: But they have the Master Clock.\nDOCTOR: On their side of the mirror. We need it here, with us. Now, let me see.\nCHARLEY: [OC]: They're searching the other buildings.\nPRIESTLY: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Just a few adjustments.\nPRIESTLY: You've lost them!\nDOCTOR: I need to get to the Hall of Clocks and Mirrors. Osric can stabilise a portal for them to get through.\nFERDINAND: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: I don't. I'm hoping. But if there are Daleks already manifested in the history of the sixteenth century, then things are getting out of hand. Right, that should do it. Come on, Major. Follow me through the mirror.\nBOY: Professor, look. Doctor.\nOSRIC: You do believe in making an entrance. And you, Major Ferdinand.\nFERDINAND: Professor Osric.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, both of you. I was hoping to persuade Professor Osric to make a swift exit.\nOSRIC: Through the mirror?\nDOCTOR: It's connected to the mirror in the rebel base, not that you'd know anything about that, would you?\nOSRIC: Well.\nDOCTOR: Tell me later. Right now they need your help.\nOSRIC: Viola and I helped them set it up, Doctor, as I think you've guessed. But getting it working again is a problem\nDOCTOR: Do your best, please. They're depending on you. And when you've done that.\nOSRIC: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Tell Priestly and his people they must attack the palace. History is changing, and they have to stop the Daleks before it's too late. Too late for us all.\nOSRIC: I'll do what I can.\nBOY: Can they succeed?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. I hope so. With surprise on their side, it could be the only chance we have.\nFERDINAND: Someone's coming. You two, hide until we see who it is. Behind the mirror, quickly.\nBOY: Yes, Doctor.\nLEARMAN: Osric? Where've you got to, man. Ah, Ferdinand. Have you seen him?\nFERDINAND: I'm afraid not, ma'am. The Hall was deserted when I arrived just now.\nLEARMAN: Hmm. Not like him to push off and leave the job half done. What are you doing?\nDALEK: This mirror has been reconfigured as a spatial corridor. Observe.\nOSRIC: [OC]: Stand aside, now. Let me see what I can do.\nLEARMAN: Rebels.\nOSRIC: I must say, I don't hold out much hope without a source of chronons.\nPRIESTLY: Professor, please. You have to do something.\nCHARLEY: [OC]: They're coming this way!\nVIOLA: [OC]: I still can't get through. Priestly, wake up in there!\nPRIESTLY: Come on, Professor.\nOSRIC: No, it's no use.\nCHARLEY: [OC]: Here, let me try.\nDALEK: [OC]: Renegade humans located. Exterminate! Exterminate!\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Exterminate.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Oh, thank you. You couldn't have done that sooner, I suppose.\nOSRIC: I'm not sure what I did do.\nVIOLA: Well, whatever it was, it worked.\nOSRIC: Priestly, the Doctor says that history is changing. He says you are to attack the Daleks and stop them.\nPRIESTLY: I'll get everyone ready. Hart?\nOSRIC: I must get back before they miss me.\nCHARLEY: Look, in the mirror. Back into the past.\nDALEK: [OC]: Renegade humans have escaped from this location.\nVIOLA: Daleks. They're changing.\nDALEK: [OC]: Search the immediate area.\nYOKEL: [OC]: Those thieving girls can't have gone far. The Constable wants them found.\nCHARLEY: Yes! The Daleks. History's been reset. The probabilities have changed again.\nVIOLA: What does that mean?\nCHARLEY: It means we can still win.\nDALEK: Your scientist has betrayed us.\nLEARMAN: A point you will be able to make to him yourself in a moment.\nDALEK: Attack squad seven will report to Hall of Mirrors immediately.\nOSRIC: [OC]: I'd better be getting back.\nPRIESTLY: [OC]: We'll follow you through as soon as everyone's ready.\nVIOLA: [OC]: Ready to attack from within the palace. We can take them by surprise. Charley, you take care of the Master Clock. Get it to the Doctor.\nCHARLEY: [OC]: If you're sure.\nLEARMAN: A veritable collection of traitors, it seems.\nBOY: Can't we warn them?\nDOCTOR: I wish we could, but they'd stop us as soon as they see us. They still want me alive, but they'd kill you.\nBOY: Then our fears to make us all traitors.\nDALEK: Spatial portal opening.\nLEARMAN: Greetings, Professor.\nOSRIC: General Learman. I, I can explain.\nLEARMAN: Oh, there's no need. We saw and heard everything. In your mirror.\nOSRIC: No, please, listen to me.\nFERDINAND: Wait, General, stop him. We need to interrogate him.\nLEARMAN: Come not between the dragon and his wrath.\nDALEK: Exterminate! Kill the Professor!\nHART: [OC]: Everyone's ready, Priestly, Miss Learman.\nDALEK: 3: Attack squad seven reporting.\nDALEK: All Daleks to battle position.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nLEARMAN: My niece. You will spare her.\nDALEK: All enemies of the Daleks will be exterminated.\nVIOLA: [OC]: We're going through.\nFERDINAND: You can't! It'll be a massacre.\nLEARMAN: You will spare her life or our agreement is\nDALEK: She is not relevant to our agreement.\nBOY: Doctor, we have to help them.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, we do.\nFERDINAND: Viola, don't come through!\nDOCTOR: They can't hear you, Major Ferdinand.\nDALEK: Doctor!\nLEARMAN: How good of you to join us. Come over here, away from the mirror.\nDOCTOR: You don't need to kill them. You can take them captive.\nDALEK: Spatial portal opening.\nLEARMAN: Viola.\nVIOLA: Aunt Mariah!\nPRIESTLY: Get back! It's a trap!\nHART: [OC] Come on through, quick as you can.\nVIOLA: No, go back. Charley don't bring the Master Clock through!\nDOCTOR: Don't kill them. Let them surrender.\nPRIESTLY: Surrender? What's going on?\nDOCTOR: Please listen. You have to surrender to the Daleks or it will be a massacre.\nHART: Too right. We outnumber them three to one.\nCHARLEY: Doctor! Doctor, what's happening?\nDOCTOR: Charley?\nDALEK: Exterminate.\nDOCTOR: No! You harm one hair on her head and I won't help you, not ever.\nDALEK: The humans will surrender or be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: Priestly, listen to me. The Daleks have superior firepower and the strategic position.\nPRIESTLY: We have to see this through, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don't do it!\nVIOLA: We have to. Think of what's at stake.\nDOCTOR: You are at stake.\nLEARMAN: I order you to surrender.\nPRIESTLY: We don't take orders from you.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, it's all of history. You said so yourself.\nDOCTOR: Discretion is the better part of valour. You can't do anything if you're dead.\nCHARLEY: We've seen it, what happens.\nDOCTOR: Charley!\nCHARLEY: The suffering. The lines of slave.\nFERDINAND: Give up. You have no alternative.\nCHARLEY: If the Daleks shoot at me, they'll damage their precious Master Clock. I'll be all right, Doctor.\nFERDINAND: Lay down your weapons, and put up your hands. That's an order!\nPRIESTLY: We cannot obey that order. You know we cannot obey that order.\nDALEK: You will obey!\nPRIESTLY: Never!\nLEARMAN: Viola!\nFERDINAND: Cease firing! Cease firing! Both sides!\nDALEK: Caution! Caution! The Master Clock must not be damaged!\nDOCTOR: Charley!\nCHARLEY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Charley!"

Destroy all resistance.\nDALEKS: (overlapping) Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: Charley, are you all right?\nPRIESTLY: Viola, come on!\nLEARMAN: Stay here, Viola.\nVIOLA: Aunt Mariah, let me go!\nLEARMAN: I said, stay here!\nDALEK: Surviving rebels escaping into passage. Pursue! Pursue!\nVIOLA: I hope you're satisfied, Aunt.\nLEARMAN: The fault lies with the rebels, not with myself.\nDOCTOR: It's all right, she's breathing.\nVIOLA: Charley.\nDOCTOR: I think the Clock absorbed the energy of the blast.\nLEARMAN: It'd better not be damaged.\nDOCTOR: Has anyone ever told you that you have a rather warped sense of priorities, General Learman?\nVIOLA: I think she's waking.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Ow. Doctor. Oh, Doctor, is that you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Charley, I'm here. You're going to be fine.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Good.\nDALEK: She will be held captive to ensure the Doctor's cooperation.\nDOCTOR: She's injured. She needs rest.\nLEARMAN: Viola can take her to her room and look after her. You, boy, go with her.\nBOY: Yes, ma'am.\nDOCTOR: I'll see you soon, Charley, I promise.\nPRIESTLY: This way. Come on!\nHART: They're picking off the stragglers. There's only a few of us left now. Priestly, what do we do?\nPRIESTLY: Come on, this way.\nHART: But that's further into the palace! Where are we going?\nDALEK: Attack squad alpha will prepare for temporal transfer.\nDOCTOR: You're going back in time, through the mirror?\nLEARMAN: The mirror sent Viola and your friend Charley back to the sixteenth century. The Daleks can go back for Shakespeare.\nDOCTOR: I admire your stoic optimism, but we have no idea what he needs saving from. And whatever it is, it originates here, in this place and time.\nDALEK: Master Clock in position. Energy level building.\nDALEK: 2: Target coordinates set.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Learman. Time is crystallising along a different path. A new history.\nLEARMAN: What say you?\nDOCTOR: A history where the Daleks are the rulers, where they have always been the rulers of your planet.\nDALEK: Prepare for transference.\nDOCTOR: That's what this is about. Not Shakespeare.\nFERDINAND: What is it, Doctor? What's wrong?\nDALEK: 2: Chronon level insufficient to sustain temporal portal. Doctor!\nFERDINAND: Why isn't it working for them?\nDOCTOR: Because the Master Clock's been damaged. The Daleks shot it, remember?\nDALEK: You will effect repairs.\nDOCTOR: It might take a little while, you know, but I suppose you have the time.\nDALEK: Begin at once. I will return to our ship.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Charley, what have I got you into?\nHART: Priestly. Priestly, stop. Stop.\nPRIESTLY: What?\nHART: Where are we going?\nPRIESTLY: This way. I think.\nHART: Are we going to rescue Viola?\nPRIESTLY: It's too late for her. For all of us. But perhaps we can still save Shakespeare.\nHART: Who?\nDOCTOR: I don't understand how or why the Clock worked in the first place, but given it's in our interests to take as long as we can, it's not the main thing.\nFERDINAND: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: We go and see Charley. (loud) Excuse me. You there. Yes, you. I need to speak to Charley and Viola.\nDALEK: 2: Request denied. You will remain here.\nDOCTOR: I can't continue working until I have the information I need from them.\nDALEK: 2: That is not necessary.\nDOCTOR: Not necessary? I think it's very necessary. Don't you think it's necessary, Major Ferdinand?\nFERDINAND: Oh, absolutely essential, I'd say.\nDOCTOR: Essential! Well, there you are, then.\nDALEK: 2: They will be brought to you.\nDOCTOR: Charley is ill. Injured.\nFERDINAND: She shouldn't be moved.\nDALEK: 2: Request denied. Continue work.\nDOCTOR: Listen, if you know so much about it, you fix the Clock. I'm on strike. Good, eh? Clock, strike. No?\nFERDINAND: I think the subtlety's lost on him.\nDOCTOR: We'll see.\nDALEK: 2: Request accepted. Follow me.\nDOCTOR: Lay on, McDalek.\nDALEK: Establish communications with Imperial flagship.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nDALEK: Dalek Supreme to Emperor.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Report.\nDALEK: Operation proceeding to plan. Secondary Temporal Extinction Device being prepared. It will be powered by the human's nuclear reactor.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Full Time Ship capabilities must be restored before the device is detonated.\nDALEK: Understood. The Doctor will provide the necessary temporal engineering and componentry. We are holding his companion and his Tardis has been located.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Victory is assured. Proceed.\nDALEK: I obey.\nPRIESTLY: No, no. Shakespeare. William Shakespeare.\nHART: I've never heard of him.\nPRIESTLY: He's what this is all about.\nHART: This is about the Daleks. About breaking their hold, liberating the human race.\nPRIESTLY: Liberating? It's Learman who's in control of New Britain, not the Daleks.\nHART: Your memory's screwed, Priestly, not mine. Learman is the Dalek's puppet ruler. You must remember that? The Daleks have ruled us for longer than recorded history. Shakespeare, whoever he might be, is irrelevant.\nPRIESTLY: The Doctor was right. All history is changing. I don't know what past is real any more.\nHART: What do you mean?\nPRIESTLY: Doesn't matter. What matters is that we finish this. Come on.\nHART: Where are we going?\nPRIESTLY: To find the reactor.\nBOY: Someone approaches.\nCHARLEY: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello, Charley. Feeling better?\nVIOLA: Major Ferdinand? You took your time.\nFERDINAND: I'm pleased to see you, too.\nDOCTOR: You can go. We'll be fine now, thanks.\nDALEK: 2: I will observe your communication with the humans.\nDOCTOR: No, you won't. You make them nervous and I need a sensible, detached appraisal of the situation, so you can wait outside. Thank you.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Agreed.\nCHARLEY: So what's the plan, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: To get you all out of here.\nVIOLA: Past that Dalek?\nDOCTOR: I was hoping there'd be a mirror in here.\nVIOLA: There was. They smashed it up and took it away.\nDOCTOR: I can't say I blame them. That would be too easy, after all.\nFERDINAND: So, what do we do?\nDOCTOR: I want you and Viola to find Priestly and his people, assuming they're still alive, and give them what help you can.\nVIOLA: We do have to get out of here first.\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nCHARLEY: So how do we do that?\nDOCTOR: Don't you work in the kitchens usually?\nBOY: Yes, sir, but there is little that is usual about today.\nFERDINAND: Is this important, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Important? It's vital. I don't know about you, but I've not had a bite to eat for simply ages.\nDOCTOR: Ah, there you are.\nDALEK: 2: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We're feeling a bit peckish in here so I'm sending Major Ferdinand and the kitchen boy for a takeaway.\nDALEK: 2: Request denied. Major Ferdinand will remain here.\nDOCTOR: What about the lad? He's hardly important to you, is he now? And I could murder a cheese and pickle sandwich.\nDALEK: 2: The young male human may go.\nDALEK: 4: I will accompany him.\nDOCTOR: Don't worry about anything fancy. Just whatever you can find in the kitchens.\nBOY: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: Ham, cheese, caviar, whatever.\nDALEK: 4: We will leave now.\nDOCTOR: Off you go now. Be careful and be quick. (sotto) And there's one other thing you can do for me.\nBOY: (sotto) Sir?\nPRIESTLY: It's this way.\nHART: Okay, you lot. Keep moving.\nPRIESTLY: This is it. The main reactor room. We can cripple the palace from here, cut off their power.\nHART: Get back, all of you. Daleks.\nDALEK: 5: Reactor output will be raised by fifty percent.\nDALEK: 6: Excess power is to be diverted to our ship.\nDALEK: 5: The security of this area must be maintained.\nHART: What the hell are they up to?\nPRIESTLY: I don't know, but they need the power.\nHART: Can we shut it down?\nPRIESTLY: Better than that. We can blow it up.\nDOCTOR: I think that's the lot. No, no, hang on. The power supply's up my sleeve somewhere. Yes, here it is.\nFERDINAND: Aren't these what you used to rig up the mirror in my office?\nDOCTOR: Top of the class. Not the same components, of course, as they're still in there.\nCHARLEY: So with this you can connect a mirror here to one of the mirrors in the Hall?\nDOCTOR: Or in Major Ferdinand's office.\nVIOLA: But we don't have a mirror in here.\nDOCTOR: That's all right. We just have to wait for one to turn up.\nCHARLEY: Turn up?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Of course, it'll need to be big enough to climb through.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, the Daleks are not just going to let someone walk in here with a mirror, are they?\nDOCTOR: Oh, aren't they?\nDALEK: 2: Inside. Move!\nBOY: I brought some food.\nDOCTOR: Oh, excellent. Here, let's get this off the top.\nFERDINAND: Cheese and pickle. Mmm.\nCHARLEY: Ooo, is that smoked salmon?\nVIOLA: Hey, leave some for the rest of us.\nDOCTOR: What do you all think you're doing?\nCHARLEY: (mouth full) Having a sandwich.\nDOCTOR: Give me that. This is no time to be eating. We've things to do.\nFERDINAND: (mouth full) Like what?\nDOCTOR: Like getting this stuff off the tray, for a start. And you can unwrap the rest of the food. Come on, we need as much as we can get. No, no, don't scrunch it up.\nVIOLA: It's just silver foil.\nDOCTOR: Just silver foil? Just silver foil? Look. What do you see?\nVIOLA: Silver foil?\nDOCTOR: No, in it. In it.\nCHARLEY: A reflection!\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nBOY: Is that what you wanted, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you've done us proud. Now let's spread the foil as flat as we can and get it connected up.\nPRIESTLY: But we need either explosives to blow the reactor up, or the time to set it to critical. Look, the Doctor said that some event will take place that gives the Daleks control over the past.\nHART: Okay. So we destroy them now, before that happens. Whatever it is.\nPRIESTLY: Exactly. Destroy the Daleks now and history will be returned to normal.\nHART: Then we have to get this right. The eye stalk at the top of the dome, that's their weakest point.\nPRIESTLY: How do you know that?\nHART: The Daleks may not have won yet, but I've been fighting them for years.\nPRIESTLY: Right. Pass the word along. Get everyone ready.\nCHARLEY: We can see through it now.\nFERDINAND: Ha, it's my office.\nDOCTOR: Seems a good place to start. Better than risking the hall. Come on, Viola. You go first.\nVIOLA: Do I just step into it?\nDOCTOR: Yes, just like paddling, except you come out feet first at the other end. Right, Major Ferdinand, you go next.\nDALEK: 3: Unauthorised portal operating. Alert! Alert!\nDALEK: Locate the source of the emission. Locate! Locate!\nDALEK: 3: Triangulating. Source located.\nDALEK: It is the Doctor. Alert Daleks in the area. He must not escape!\nDOCTOR: Right, Charley, you're next. Then you, lad, then me.\nBOY: Is it safe?\nCHARLEY: Safer than staying here.\nDALEK: 4: Do not move.\nDOCTOR: It wasn't actually locked, you know.\nDALEK: Where are the other humans?\nDOCTOR: They just stepped out for a minute. I don't think they want your company, somehow.\nDALEK: The Doctor and his companion will be taken to our ship.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) You'd better stay here.\nBOY: If you say so, sir.\nDOCTOR: See if you can get to the kitchen or the library.\nCHARLEY: Somewhere that's safe.\nDALEK: Move!\nVIOLA: Oh, it's just a mirror again. There's nobody else following us through.\nFERDINAND: All clear out here. Let's head for the barracks.\nVIOLA: The rebels are hardly likely to be there.\nFERDINAND: True, but that's where the armoury is, and we may find some help.\nVIOLA: Daleks! Quick, get back.\nDALEK: [OC]: Rebels sighted in main reactor area. All available Daleks will proceed to that area immediately.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: I obey.\nDALEK: [OC]: You will come with me.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Oh, absolutely. There are a few things I wish to discuss with your superiors.\nVIOLA: What's she up to?\nFERDINAND: I don't know. They're taking her to the Hall. To the Dalek ship, perhaps.\nVIOLA: It's all clear now. Come on!\nCHARLEY: I'm getting used to these portal things.\nDALEK: 3: Vessel's integrity within vortex holding.\nDALEK: 4: Scan for temporal activity.\nDALEK: 3: Continuing.\nDALEK: 7: Assimilating data.\nDALEK: 3: All parameters within safety margins.\nDOCTOR: Hello there. Brought us here for a little t@te-@-t@te, have you?\nDALEK: Doctor, this is your final warning. Any further resistance will result in the extermination of your companion.\nCHARLEY: Oh, thanks.\nDALEK: You will repair the Master Clock.\nDOCTOR: Of course. And then you leave us in peace. But I don't work under duress. A guarantee of safety for my friends would be an encouragement, don't you think?\nDALEK: If the Master Clock is not functional within one hour, you will all be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: Well, I suppose that's an incentive.\nDALEK: 3: Scientific unit reports that rebel forces are attacking the reactor area.\nDALEK: Doctor, you will return to your work.\nDOCTOR: We'll see ourselves out.\nDALEK: Order scientific unit to engage and destroy rebel forces.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nCHARLEY: What are you doing here?\nLEARMAN: I don't think that's any of your business, young lady.\nDOCTOR: Come to find out how they're getting along with Shakespeare, have you? Between you and me, I'm not impressed.\nLEARMAN: As I understand it, Doctor, the Daleks are waiting for you to repair the Master Clock.\nDOCTOR: Good point. Well, I won't keep you. I'm sure you have lots to discuss.\nDALEK: 3: You will return to the Hall of Mirrors.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Come on, Charley.\nDOCTOR: Hang on, Charley.\nCHARLEY: Aren't we going back to the Hall?\nDOCTOR: Not yet. They can detect when a portal is being used. I saw them monitoring the equipment.\nCHARLEY: So that's how they knew Viola and Major Ferdinand were escaping.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. So they'd know if we tried to sneak back to find out what they're up to.\nCHARLEY: Ah.\nDOCTOR: So we wait here a moment till the coast is clear, then we go back without opening another portal.\nCHARLEY: And get back into the Dalek ship without them knowing.\nDOCTOR: Good plan, eh?\nCHARLEY: Ask me in an hour.\nDOCTOR: Nobody about. Good.\nCHARLEY: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: If we can find an empty control room, we may be able to tap into their communication system and see what's happening on the bridge.\nCHARLEY: Learman's on the bridge.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nFERDINAND: You haven't the first idea, have you.\nPRIESTLY: What are you two doing here?\nFERDINAND: I assume you want to get to the reactor.\nPRIESTLY: That's right. Past the Daleks.\nFERDINAND: Frontal attack isn't the way to do it. As soon as more Daleks arrive, you'll be trapped between them.\nVIOLA: There are more on the way, and you won't have a chance.\nFERDINAND: Pull half your men back.\nPRIESTLY: How will that help?\nFERDINAND: Keep the Daleks occupied here while we go round the side and blow our way in through the corridor wall.\nPRIESTLY: Blow our way in? With what?\nVIOLA: About twenty kilos of plastic explosive from the armoury.\nDOCTOR: Bridge, bridge, bridge. There must be a video feed somewhere. Ah.\nCHARLEY: That's it. Well done, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Now we find out who is bluffing who.\nDALEK: [OC]: We will dispatch a squad of Daleks to locate Shakespeare.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: The fact that Shakespeare is vanishing from history confirms your success.\nCHARLEY: What does she mean? Surely if they're going to save Shakespeare\nDOCTOR: Shush. Listen.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: That's the root of our country's troubles. We can give birth to a genius like William Shakespeare. But how many actually appreciate that genius? We've done it before so we think we can do it again, resting on our laurels and hamstrung by the past.\nDALEK: [OC]: And what of Shakespeare?\nLEARMAN: [OC]: We can't allow him to become merely a figurehead for the rebels. His genius is so far in excess of their ability to understand it. It's wasted on the rabble. Pearls before swine. That is why Shakespeare must die!\nFERDINAND: Get your people to stand clear. As soon as the charges blow, we'll go in.\nPRIESTLY: Be quick. Hart can't hold them back for much longer.\nVIOLA: You'd better hand out these grenades.\nDALEK: We will provide a shielded copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare.\nLEARMAN: So only I will remember Shakespeare. Only someone who truly appreciates and venerates his genius will know of his work. Good.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Excellent.\nDOCTOR: Appalling, more like.\nDALEK: [OC]: Shakespeare and his plays will never have existed. He will remain only in the table of your memory. Return General Learman to the\nCHARLEY: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Now we know what Learman's real agenda is, I want to know what the Daleks are up to.\nCHARLEY: They're out to murder Shakespeare, that's what they're up to.\nDOCTOR: They don't give a tinker's cuss about Shakespeare. It isn't his life or death that changes history. It's something more massive, more horrendous. This is a side show.\nCHARLEY: So why are they bothering if it's a distraction?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps this will tell us.\nCHARLEY: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Archived monitor data.\nCHARLEY: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: Black box flight recorder, Charley. It may show us how and why they got here. If I can just find the right sequence\nCHARLEY: Which is?\nDOCTOR: Immediately prior to their arrival at Learman's\nDALEK: [OC]: Temporal energy is released.\nDOCTOR: Ah, here we go.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Danger! Danger! Time fissure destabilising!\nDOCTOR: So the fissure was already (inaudible under noise of the replay.)\nDALEK: [OC]: Device operating outside safety parameters.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Energy wave approaching. This vessel is now endangered.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, does that\nDOCTOR: There's more than just this ship stuck here.\nCHARLEY: A whole fleet!\nDALEK: [OC]: Advise Imperial Command that the device has malfunctioned.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: I obey.\nDOCTOR: What do they do next?\nDALEK: [OC]: Deploy escape corridor. Activate full temporal shielding.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Shielding activated. Hull integrity falling to seventy\nDALEK: 3 [OC]: Temporal collapse estimated in twenty two Rels.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Corridor locked on source of time fissure. Stability of corridor not guaranteed.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Hull integrity\nDOCTOR: They managed to extrude an escape corridor and attach it to one end of the fissure, to Learman's mirrors.\nCHARLEY: Then they tried to evacuate the ship.\nDALEK: 3 [OC]: Temporal collapse in ten Rels.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Hull stability failing.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: A temporal stabiliser element is required to restore hull integrity and dissipate time energy.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Total collapse in seven Rels.\nDOCTOR: There goes the pilot down the corridor.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Pilot evacuating.\nCHARLEY: Another Dalek, escaping, and another.\nDOCTOR: That makes three so far.\nDALEK: [OC]: Our Strategists will implement rescue procedures.\nCHARLEY: Four Daleks are out now.\nDALEK: 2 [OC]: Corridor collapsing.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Trapped in corridor. Alert! Alert! Gaaaah!\nCHARLEY: What happened to that one?\nDOCTOR: Temporal collapse. Nasty. Four Daleks got out, and one of those was destroyed in the time corridor. They sent the strategists to plan the rescue, and the pilot for his expertise in temporal engineering.\nCHARLEY: But we only saw two Daleks before the mirror opened again.\nDOCTOR: I wonder what happened to the third Dalek? And I'd like to know what this device was. Questions, questions. Let's get back to the Hall of Mirrors before they miss us.\nCHARLEY: And what do we do there?\nDOCTOR: Start getting some answers.\nPRIESTLY: Charges set, Major.\nFERDINAND: Good. Once that wall's down we'll use the grenades.\nPRIESTLY: Right.\nVIOLA: Right.\nFERDINAND: Keep your heads down. Here we go. Detonating now!\nDALEK: 5 [OC]: Alert! Alert! Rebels have gained access to main reactor area,\nDALEK: 6 [OC]: Assist! Assist!\nFERDINAND: Grenades now!\nDALEK: 6 [OC]: Vision impaired. I cannot see. Emergency! Emergency!\nFERDINAND: Come on, we've got to get to the inner chamber.\nVIOLA: We can seal that from the inside.\nPRIESTLY: Hart! Get your people over here!\nHART: [OC]: On our way. Move it! Move it!\nDALEK: 5 [OC]: Exterminate!\nPRIESTLY: Hart! Hart!\nVIOLA: Leave him. We've got to leave him, Priestly. He's dead.\nPRIESTLY: Noooo!\nFERDINAND: We're all dead if we don't get moving.\nDALEK: 3: Rebels now within main reactor area.\nDALEK: Dispatch more Daleks to assist. Report on progress of power supply.\nDALEK: 4: Device now fully charged. Once a temporal stabiliser is available it can be deployed.\nDALEK: 3: Portal activated. Unauthorised use of time corridor from ship to Hall.\nLEARMAN: The Doctor? I thought he'd gone.\nDALEK: 3: Scanning. Chronon source detected in Hall of Mirrors.\nDALEK: 4: Indications are that the Master Clock has been repaired and is functioning at full capacity.\nDOCTOR: Careful, don't drop it.\nCHARLEY: It's just a clock, as far as I can tell.\nDOCTOR: That's right. There's an inductive connection to the main panel here, but apart\nDOCTOR: from that, nothing.\nCHARLEY: So how does it work?\nDOCTOR: Well, it doesn't. That's the point.\nLEARMAN: How wrong you are, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I see we have company.\nLEARMAN: The Daleks have detected a chronon source in this room. The Clock is indeed working again.\nDALEK: Activate mirrors.\nDALEK: 2: I obey.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, look.\nDOCTOR: I can see, Charley.\nCHARLEY: The mirrors. All of them, showing scenes from the past.\nLEARMAN: London through the ages. A living history if you like.\nDOCTOR: And with the Master Clock working again there's nothing to stop you from stepping through into Roman times over there, or Regency here. The Blitz in that corner, what looks like the Great Plague in that.\nDALEK: Dalek victory is assured. We are the Masters of Time!\nFERDINAND: Priestly, what's up ahead?\nPRIESTLY: There's a shutter, then another door like an airlock.\nFERDINAND: Must be in case of a radiation leak. Come on.\nVIOLA: More Daleks coming.\nFERDINAND: Everyone inside. Lower the shutters.\nVIOLA: They'll just blow their way in.\nFERDINAND: It'll take them a while.\nFERDINAND: So, now we're inside, what's your plan?\nPRIESTLY: Drop in the fuel rods, drain off the coolant. Blow the place sky high.\nVIOLA: And us with it.\nPRIESTLY: But we destroy the Daleks. Whatever they're doing to change history, we stop it before it happens.\nVIOLA: All right.\nFERDINAND: Let's get on with it, then.\nCHARLEY: What's happening? They're changing. All the scenes are changing.\nDOCTOR: Desolation and despair. Nightmare landscapes of ruin and rubble.\nCHARLEY: And Daleks. Everywhere there are Daleks.\nLEARMAN: Isn't it obvious, Doctor? The Dalek victory over Time, over Earth's history, has moved a step closer.\nDOCTOR: Possibilities crystallise into probabilities, which harden into certainties.\nDALEK: Assassination squad will prepare to return to the sixteenth century time zone.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nLEARMAN: The final act.\nDOCTOR: Sending a couple of Daleks to kill Shakespeare. You really think that matters now, Learman? Can't you see all of history is changing?\nLEARMAN: Do you think I care, Doctor? Humanity, like our own small country, has abdicated the right to its own history. Better to end it now than continue the slide into decadence and decay.\nDOCTOR: Decadence and decay? What do you think that is? Or that? It's what your history will soon become. The ultimate nightmare. Hell on Earth. The Apocalypse.\nLEARMAN: But as long as I remember, Shakespeare will live on inside me. His works, humanity's greatest achievements, will survive.\nCHARLEY: You're quite, quite mad, aren't you.\nLEARMAN: The Daleks will win, whatever happens. Their victory is certain. This way, my way, at least something of the glory of the human race will survive.\nTANNOY: Nuclear reactor has suffered catastrophic failure.\nLEARMAN: The rebels!\nTANNOY: Containment breach imminent. Main reactor will explode in two minutes.\nDOCTOR: What? Idiots!\nCHARLEY: They'll kill us all!\nDALEK: Order Daleks in reactor area to subdue the rebellion! The reaction must be contained!\nDOCTOR: With the mirrors working again, it isn't just us at risk.\nCHARLEY: You mean the explosions will travel through the mirrors to the other time zones?\nLEARMAN: Every significant time period in London destroyed by a nuclear explosion.\nTANNOY: Main reactor will explode in ninety seconds.\nDALEK: The explosion will also breach the time corridor to our ship. The harmonic power source will detonate within the vortex.\nDOCTOR: A huge explosion within the vortex.\nCHARLEY: Will the explosion of their ship be enough to damage Time itself?\nDOCTOR: Probably not, but there's more than one ship out there, remember?\nCHARLEY: How many ships are there in your fleet?\nDALEK: Seventeen hundred.\nDOCTOR: Seventeen hundred? That sort of chain reaction could rupture the Web of Time!\nTANNOY: Main reactor will explode in sixty seconds.\nDOCTOR: You have to disconnect the time corridor, cut us off from your ship.\nDALEK: Not possible. Without a temporal stabiliser, our fleet will be helpless.\nDOCTOR: If you don't, your fleet will be obliterated.\nCHARLEY: Along with all of history.\nDALEK: Daleks in reactor area will deal with the problem.\nDOCTOR: I admire your confidence, but I don't think there's time.\nDALEK: Assassination squad will depart. Set coordinates for London in the year one five eight five.\nDALEK: 2: I obey. Master Clock responding.\nCHARLEY: I can feel it, tingling like an electric charge.\nDALEK: 2: Coordinates set. Squad will proceed.\nDALEKS: We obey.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, they've gone!\nDOCTOR: And in a moment we'll see them emerge into the image in the mirror.\nDALEK: Shakespeare will be exterminated.\nTANNOY: Main reactor will explode in thirty seconds.\nDOCTOR: Not that it matters now.\nLEARMAN: Of course it matters. When history changes, Shakespeare will be taken from it. The rebels have handed the Daleks victory over all of Time.\nCHARLEY: No! Doctor, that can't be right, can it?\nDOCTOR: Catastrophic event, Charley. The very thing we've been trying to prevent. This is it, here and now. When the reactor explodes, and the energy is channelled into the vortex and magnified by the exploding Dalek fleet. That's what causes the damage. That's what gives the Daleks their chance. This is the end of history as we know it, and the start of the Time of the Daleks."

Charley, there's a thumb wheel on the back that controls the date settings.\nDALEK: 2: Alert! Portal end point shifting. Assassination squad split between destination time zones.\nTANNOY: Main reactor will explode in ten seconds.\nDALEK: Attack squad prepare firepower maximum. Daleks at shutters will trigger self-destruct mechanisms now!\nVIOLA: The Daleks are through!\nDALEK: 5: Reset main controls.\nFERDINAND: The explosion's cracked the glass ceiling over the main reactor.\nDALEK: 5: Apply safety procedures.\nPRIESTLY: No! Stop them! Argh!\nVIOLA: Priestly!\nTANNOY: Safety measures applied. Reactor returning to normal.\nFERDINAND: Out! Viola, quick. The screen's coming\nDALEK: 6: Radiation is released.\nDALEK: 5: Lower secondary blast shutters.\nDALEK: 6: Wait. Dalek units are still within the reactor area.\nDALEK: 5: Halt! Halt! Do not move!\nFERDINAND: All right, all right, we surrender.\nDALEK: 5: Prisoners will follow me.\nVIOLA: What about your friends?\nDALEK: 5: Friends?\nFERDINAND: The Daleks trapped behind the blast shutter.\nDALEK: 5: Radiation must be contained or equipment and human labour force will be contaminated. Daleks trapped within the affected area will remain there.\nVIOLA: For how long?\nDALEK: 5: For ever.\nLEARMAN: Well, if you'll excuse me, I have things to attend to.\nCHARLEY: What did you do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I reset the end point just as the Daleks emerged.\nCHARLEY: So they're in different time zones?\nDOCTOR: If the clock wasn't connected into the mirrors, since you're holding the clock and\nDOCTOR: I've shifted you back in time a few minutes\nCHARLEY: You mean, I'd have met myself?\nDOCTOR: The time differential would have shorted out and the older Charley would have been consumed by the temporal energy.\nCHARLEY: Oh. Why the older?\nDOCTOR: Because the younger one has to survive to meet herself later. Look, the mirrors are changing back to established history. The emergency's over and Shakespeare is safe.\nDALEK: Probability still indicates that the Daleks will destroy history.\nDOCTOR: Really? Well just as the moment, history is destroying your Daleks. Just look at the 1940 zone.\nOFFICER: Get to the shelters, you lot. Jerry's not done with us yet.\nDALEK: Where is Shakespeare?\nOFFICER: What the?\nDALEK: Answer. Answer!\nOFFICER: Good God. Over here, men. Bring the grenades.\nDALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate.\nOFFICER: We can stop it. Wait till it's by that wall, then throw all the grenades at once. Now!\nOFFICER: Got it!\nDOCTOR: And the other Dalek seems to be having some trouble with the Romans.\nMARCUS: Ignore the sky. It's just the aurora. It's a mirage. A demon!\nDALEK: Alert!\nMARCUS: A metal demon. What has this got to do with anything? Don't just stand there, attack it! Take it together. Put up your shields. Charge in the tortoise. Push it in the ditch!\nDALEK: Emergency! Emergency!\nMARCUS: That's it, lads. We killed it. Now come on, to the gate. Help the servants and the other troopers out. Come on. Get moving there.\nDOCTOR: I don't think you're cut out to be the Masters of Time.\nDALEK: You underestimate the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: You mean like you underestimated the Time Lords when you invaded Gallifrey?\nCHARLEY: They invaded Gallifrey?\nDALEK: Time Lord technology was necessary. Our fleet is now powered by harmonic energy.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDALEK: We have created an Eye of Harmony from the Time Lord design.\nDOCTOR: You'd still need a way of shifting the Eye fractionally into the future.\nCHARLEY: Why, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Otherwise you'd get all the power in one gulp rather than a controllable osmotic stream. That function was built into the Eye itself by Omega. You didn't get that from Gallifrey.\nDALEK: We acquired the technology from the Time Barrier on Kar-Charrat. We have the knowledge we need.\nDOCTOR: The irony is that if you'd let the reactor explode, that would have cause the very\nDOCTOR: time rift you need. But without that sort of massive disruption within the vortex, there's no way you can control Time.\nDALEK: We have been delayed, not defeated.\nDALEK: 2: Emperor Dalek on flagship requires status update.\nDALEK: I will return to the ship.\nDOCTOR: Give him my regards. (sotto) If the Emperor Dalek is on one of the ships, he must seriously believe they have the means to conquer Time itself.\nCHARLEY: But the reactor's been shut down.\nDOCTOR: That was a coincidence, and they could have let it explode.\nCHARLEY: Then why didn't they?\nDOCTOR: They'd do it if that was required. Single-minded is an understatement. Dedicated doesn't even come close.\nCHARLEY: Perhaps they have some other way of achieving the same result.\nDOCTOR: A detonation even more massive than a tidal wave would be felt before we arrived here. An enormous destructive power that they can actually focus onto a time fissure. Oh, I hope not, Charley. I sincerely hope not.\nEMPEROR: Report.\nDALEK: A second Temporal Extinction Device has been prepared. The Master Clock is now fully functional. Once our ship is stabilised within the vortex, we can detonate the device.\nEMPEROR: Why should you delay?\nDALEK: Our Pilot was destroyed on arrival at Learman's palace. Temporal expertise is necessary to maintain integrity of this vessel within the eye of the detonation.\nEMPEROR: The Doctor has the requisite knowledge.\nDALEK: The Doctor is unreliable. He will attempt to thwart the Dalek plan.\nEMPEROR: Agreed. Alternatives?\nDALEK: A replacement Pilot is available.\nDOCTOR: A device that explodes within the vortex, that creates a temporal tide wave directed at a time fissure.\nCHARLEY: They were trying to split it open, like frost cracking. Pour water into a tiny split. When the water freezes overnight, it forces it open further.\nDOCTOR: Something of the sort. Only it went wrong. They rode out the energy wave we felt, but were trapped.\nCHARLEY: And now they're ready to try again. What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: The more we know about what happened and what they're up to, the better our options. Ah, that's it.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, there's Daleks in the mirror.\nDALEK: [OC]: Approaching end of time corridor.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, Charley, I set the mirror to depict past events. Those three Daleks are escaping from their ship down the escape conduit, remember?\nDALEK: [OC]: End of corridor anchored on source of time fissure. Proceed.\nCHARLEY: The corridor's collapsing behind them. It's caught the fourth Dalek.\nDALEK: 4 [OC]: Alert! Alert!\nCHARLEY: There's Learman and Professor Osric, working on their equipment.\nDOCTOR: I think they're in for a bit of a surprise. Let's see what happens.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Power! Temporal energy, as if\nOSRIC: [OC]: In the mirror. My God, what are they?\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Perdition catch my soul.\nOSRIC: [OC]: They're coming through.\nDALEK: [OC]: Temporal equipment primitive but acceptable.\nPILOT: [OC]: We will require the cooperation of these human beings.\nDOCTOR: They'll need Learman's help to rescue the others.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Chaos has come again.\nCHARLEY: Lucky they found a time experiment.\nDOCTOR: Not luck at all. That's what they latched the corridor onto.\nPILOT: [OC]: Quotations identified.\nDALEK: [OC]: Pilot will elaborate.\nPILOT: [OC]: Shakespeare, William. Born in the year one five six four. Died one six one six. First quotation Othello. Second quotation Richard the Third.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: You know about Shakespeare. My excellent good friends, how dost thou?\nPILOT: [OC]: There are many events in the womb of Time which may be delivered, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Well said indeed.\nOSRIC: [OC]: But what are they?\nLEARMAN: [OC]: Scholars, Professor. Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading. I would shake your hand, but\nCHARLEY: What happened? She just touched the Dalek and it\nDOCTOR: It's gone. Shorted out the time differential, by the look of it. Residual energies burned out the connections here too, unfortunately.\nCHARLEY: But what happened?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks were charged up with chronons from the time corridor, I suppose. When Learman touched that Dalek, she earthed it to the present. Result, temporal implosion. I think.\nCHARLEY: Oh, nasty.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. But it does tell us one thing.\nCHARLEY: What's that?\nDOCTOR: Unless they carry a spare, they need a new Pilot.\nLEARMAN: It is polite to knock before entering, you know.\nDALEK: 2: You will come with us.\nLEARMAN: I'm busy. Get out.\nDALEK: 2: Our ship requires a new Pilot.\nLEARMAN: You have my sympathy. Now go away.\nDALEK: 2: You have the necessary temporal expertise to pilot the ship.\nLEARMAN: What? I doubt it. I know how my own equipment works, but as far as yours in concerned my mind is a very opal.\nDALEK: 2: The Pilot is slaved to the main flight systems via positronic linkage to the Dalek inside its casing. Your expertise is sufficient to instruct the systems.\nLEARMAN: In case it had passed you by, I am not a Dalek.\nDALEK: 2: You will be.\nLEARMAN: What?\nDALEK: 2: You will accompany us to the irradiated reactor area. Move!\nLEARMAN: Get, get, get off me, you stupid\nDALEK: 2: Move!\nLEARMAN: You, you can't do this! Let me go!\nDALEK: 2: A transient time corridor has been established through the reactor area. It will accelerate the effects of the radiation on your body.\nLEARMAN: It'll kill me, you idiot.\nDALEK: 2: Drugs will stimulate the mutation.\nLEARMAN: What about our agreement? What about Shakespeare?\nDALEK: 2: Our agreement stands. The Temporal Extinction Device will obliterate all knowledge of Shakespeare. He will cease to have existed.\nLEARMAN: But his plays, the memory. You promised. You said that I would remember Shakespeare.\nDALEK: 2: We have a memory sphere containing the Complete Works of Shakespeare. It will be inserted into the positronic linkages between you and the Dalek casing. You will retain full knowledge of Shakespeare and his works.\nLEARMAN: So much for honour.\nDOCTOR: It's a time paradox. I wonder why I seem to be chasing or being chased by time paradoxes unless\nCHARLEY: The time fissure is caused by whatever the Daleks are going to do, only they haven't done it yet.\nDOCTOR: It's as if they've tried once and failed, but the fissure gives them the chance to go back around the loop. Some minor but defining event first forced it open just the merest whisper of a crack, and now we stand on the edge of the abyss.\nCHARLEY: I hate to ask, but where does Shakespeare fit into all this?\nDOCTOR: Shakespeare. Viola set the Master Clock to 1572.\nCHARLEY: The same date as the rebel's mirror.\nDOCTOR: Charley, that's it. You're a genius!\nCHARLEY: I am? Oh, good.\nDOCTOR: Since we seem to have the run of the place, let's go to the library.\nCHARLEY: Something you want to look up?\nDOCTOR: Someone I want to talk to.\nLEARMAN: What are you doing?\nDALEK: 2: Place General Learman in the time corridor.\nLEARMAN: Please, please, no!\nDALEK: 5: I obey.\nLEARMAN: No! Stop! I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you! (screams)\nDALEK: 2: Learman now passing through irradiated area. Mutagenic drugs are accelerating the process.\nDALEK: 5: The action of the rebels endangered this facility.\nDALEK: 6: Their weaponry and determination exceeded projections.\nDALEK: 2: Defence of the reactor area was your responsibility. We require a Dalek casing for the Learman organism.\nDALEK: 6: Understood.\nDALEK: 2: Unseal your casing.\nDALEK: 6: I (pause) obey.\nDALEK: 5: Learman organism fully mutated. Emerging from time corridor.\nDALEK: 2: Disconnecting superfluous Dalek from nutrient and control systems.\nDALEK: 2: The Dalek organism is dead. Remove it from the casing.\nDALEK: 5: Connecting Learman organism into casing. Attaching memory sphere.\nDALEK: 2: Seal your casing.\nDALEK L: (very deep voice) I obey.\nDALEK: 2: Report status.\nDALEK L: All systems fully operational. Memory sphere activated. (voice tone rises.) III met by moonlight.\nCHARLEY: So, what did you want to do here in the library?\nDOCTOR: Tidy up a few loose ends. And you can help us, can't you, my friend?\nBOY: Doctor sir, Mistress Charley.\nCHARLEY: Hello again.\nDOCTOR: You see, I don't think the Master Clock ever really worked. When the mirrors activated a month ago, it was on the residual energy from the Daleks' first device. But it was enough for the mirrors to function briefly, wasn't it?\nBOY: I, I don't know, sir. I have little understanding in these things.\nDOCTOR: But Viola understands. She brought you here, didn't she? And she told you not to talk to anyone. Not to tell them anything.\nBOY: Well, yes, sir.\nDOCTOR: And especially not your name. Isn't that right, Will?\nBOY: That's right, sir. But I didn't tell you. How did you know?\nCHARLEY: Will? You don't mean\nDOCTOR: Yes, Charley. Meet the greatest playwright in history.\nCHARLEY: Oh, my God. I mean, hello, William.\nDOCTOR: It's nothing to do with the Daleks that William here disappeared from time. It was the rebels that caused it. Viola went back and collected William Shakespeare from 1572 when he was eight years old, to protect him from the very action she herself was taking.\nCHARLEY: Another paradox.\nDOCTOR: Little by little they squeezed open the time fissure. Frost cracking, wasn't it you said?\nBOY: Could you, can you take me home, sir, please?\nDOCTOR: I hope so. I really do hope so.\nDALEK: 2: All humans are to assemble in the Hall of Clocks and Mirrors immediately.\nDOCTOR: There are just a few things I have to sort out first.\nDALEK: 2: Immediately!\nBOY: Greetings, Mistress Viola.\nVIOLA: You're safe. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we've been keeping an eye on young Will for you.\nVIOLA: You know?\nDOCTOR: Yes. But first things first, en?\nFERDINAND: I'm not sure why they didn't kill us.\nCHARLEY: Here comes the boss Dalek. You can ask him.\nDALEK: We are preparing to depart.\nDOCTOR: Bye, then. Can't say it's been a pleasure.\nDALEK: The Master Clock is linked to our timonic engines.\nCHARLEY: But I thought you said the clock\nDOCTOR: Shh, shh, shh, Charley. Yes, I rather thought it would be.\nDALEK: Once we are within the vortex, we will deploy our temporal extinction device.\nVIOLA: Your what?\nFERDINAND: Is that as serious as it sounds?\nDOCTOR: It's hard to take seriously a weapon a weapon that has the acronym TED. Sounds a bit too warm and cuddly somehow.\nVIOLA: And what happens to us?\nDALEK: You will remain here and witness the triumph of the Daleks.\nDOCTOR: In the mirrors, you mean. Because, of course, once Time is reset into your grand design, we won't know it was ever any different. Makes it hard for you to gloat after the event.\nCHARLEY: What if we don't want to watch?\nDALEK: Two Daleks will remain on guard at this location. Once the Temporal Extinction Device\nDOCTOR: You mean TED.\nDALEK: Is detonated, this facility will be destroyed.\nDALEK: 2: Countdown to launch has begun.\nDALEK: Pilot will proceed to ship.\nDALEK L: Our time doth call upon us. Once more unto the breach\nDOCTOR: We'll close up the fissure with our human dead, is that it? Your new pilot seems rather. It's Learman, isn't it?\nVIOLA: Oh, my God. It's my aunt.\nDALEK: Do not attempt to interfere. We have your Tardis.\nDOCTOR: Do you, indeed.\nDALEK: To ensure your complete cooperation, your companion will come with us.\nDOCTOR: That isn't necessary. Whatever will happen, will happen, has happened.\nDALEK L: There is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.\nDALEK: You, move.\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nDALEK: Move, or you will be exterminated!\nDOCTOR: Go with them, Charley. We have no choice. None of us has any choice now.\nCHARLEY: Goodbye, Doctor.\nDALEK: 2: Temporal stabiliser Master Clock is in position.\nDALEK: 3: Chronon level below threshold. The Master Clock is not functioning.\nDALEK: 2: Check instruments.\nDALEK: Human female will wait here. Do not move.\nCHARLEY: Whatever you say.\nDALEK: 3: Chronon level detected. Rising.\nDALEK: 2: Temporal stability possible. Ready to launch Temporal Extinction Device.\nDALEK: 3: All that remains is to sever the link to normal space time.\nCHARLEY: You mean the time corridor? You're cutting us adrift?\nDALEK: Close down time corridor. Prepare to deploy Temporal Extinction Device.\nVIOLA: It's just a mirror again.\nDOCTOR: For the moment. We can reestablish the link from this end while their ship's in a stable position in the vortex.\nBOY: So we can rescue Miss Pollard.\nFERDINAND: Not with those two Daleks watching everything, we can't.\nDOCTOR: A slight complication. I could deal with one of them, but two Daleks?\nFERDINAND: Would a grenade have any effect?\nDOCTOR: You have a grenade?\nFERDINAND: Two, actually.\nDOCTOR: Two might just be enough. If close enough to the casing, on a good day.\nVIOLA: What do you mean by a good day?\nDOCTOR: When the wind is southerly and the weather's clear. You sort out that one, I'll look after his friend.\nBOY: What shall I do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Keep well out of the way. I wonder what the exact angle of this mirror is, relative to that one over there? Oh, if only they hadn't taken Charley. I thought I had this all worked out.\nVIOLA: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: I mean she's key to the Dalek's success. Now, if you can wait until I've persuaded your Dalek to dispose of mine before you blow him up, I'd be grateful.\nDALEK: 5: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: I'm just having a look around all these mirrors. It's fascinating, don't you think?\nDALEK: 5: Return here immediately.\nBOY: Where's he gone?\nDOCTOR: Yoo hoo! Over here.\nVIOLA: There. Or is it a reflection?\nDALEK: 5: Surrender or you will be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: Not right now, thank you. Can't you see I'm busy thwarting your plans?\nDALEK: 5: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate.\nDOCTOR: Actually, I'm over here.\nDALEK: 5: Danger, energy blast reflecting!\nDALEK: 7: Under attack! Under attack! Argh!\nFERDINAND: Very neat, Doctor. Do you play billiards?\nVIOLA: Look out, the other one.\nDALEK: 5: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!\nDOCTOR: Just lodge the grenades and get away.\nDALEK: 5: Under attack.\nDOCTOR: I can't hold it.\nVIOLA: Wretched thing won't keep still.\nDALEK: 5: Under attack.\nFERDINAND: I can't. I'll have to hold the grenades in place.\nDALEK: 5: Under attack!\nFERDINAND: Get away, both of you.\nDOCTOR: Major, no!\nVIOLA: No!\nFERDINAND: Get away, unless you want to be blown to Kingdom Come with me!\nDALEK: 5: Explosive charges detected. Alert! Alert!\nVIOLA: Major Ferdinand! Noooooo!\nDOCTOR: He's gone, Viola. I'm sorry.\nVIOLA: So am I. So, this is the Dalek ship?\nDOCTOR: That's right.\nVIOLA: That's not a part of it, surely?\nDOCTOR: No, I'm happy to say that's my own ship. It's nice to see her again safe and well. I'm glad we left young William safely in the palace.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing here?\nBOY: I'm sorry, I wanted to help.\nVIOLA: Don't be hard on him, Doctor. He's as frightened as we are.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know.\nVIOLA: Let's find Charley, get back the Master Clock and go.\nDOCTOR: Charley shouldn't be too difficult. They won't expect her to have an escape route.\nVIOLA: And the Master Clock?\nDOCTOR: Oh, we don't need that.\nVIOLA: What?\nDOCTOR: The clock doesn't work. Actually, it's never worked.\nBOY: It enabled Mistress Viola to come and find me.\nDOCTOR: No, that was the residual energy bleeding through from the Dalek's first attempt.\nVIOLA: But we escaped through the mirror from the Daleks. And we saw the performance of Julius Caesar. The equipment worked. It even brought the Daleks here.\nDOCTOR: Oh, indeed it did, but the Clock is only good for setting a date and a time. It's no use at all as a temporal stabiliser.\nVIOLA: Then how?\nDOCTOR: Because there is something else here that is a rich source of chronons.\nBOY: Your vessel?\nDOCTOR: No, no. She keeps her secrets to herself. It's something else entirely. Something that went with you back to 1572. Something that was there when Julius Caesar appeared in the mirrors and the Daleks all crashed through. Something that the Daleks have with them on this ship. Except they don't realise the significance.\nCHARLEY: Why are you keeping me here?\nDALEK: Remove the prisoner from the bridge.\nDALEK: 3: I obey.\nDALEK: She will be held in isolation until our victory is complete.\nCHARLEY: Thank goodness for that.\nDALEK: Then she will be exterminated.\nCHARLEY: Oh, charming. Made all the more palatable by the way you talk about me as if I wasn't here.\nCHARLEY: All right, all right. Don't push.\nDALEK: 3: Proceed.\nCHARLEY: I am proceeding, thank you. (gasps)\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Carry on, Charley.\nCHARLEY: (sotto) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Shh. But keep to the left.\nVIOLA: She's doing it. She's leading the Dalek to the portal we came through.\nDOCTOR: Good girl, Charley. (loud) Now, Charley, out of the way! Clear the corridor!\nDALEK: 3: Alert! Alert! Under attack! Alert! Alert! Aliens at liberty! Alert! Alert!\nDOCTOR: Viola, keep down.\nVIOLA: Can't. He's too strong. We're not going to make it.\nDOCTOR: Keep pushing!\nDALEK: 3: Entering time corridor. Excess temporal energy detected! Alert! Alert! Alert!\nCHARLEY: Where did it go?\nDOCTOR: I disconnected the other end, so it opened directly into the vortex.\nCHARLEY: What happened to the Dalek?\nDOCTOR: Ripped apart by the Time Winds. Come on, we need to get Charley away from here before they explode their bomb.\nCHARLEY: But how, if the time corridor\nDOCTOR: The Tardis, of course. It's down here.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: Report.\nDALEK: We are preparing to deploy the Temporal Extinction Device.\nDALEK L: Let us tell sad stories of the death of history.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: There must be no delay.\nDALEK: Understood. Commencing final check sequence.\nEMPEROR: [OC]: We shall be the Masters of Time.\nVIOLA: We can see what they're doing.\nCHARLEY: Like the mirrors.\nDOCTOR: Similar. I've tuned the scanner into the Dalek's own monitoring system.\nCHARLEY: So what now? Dalek victory over Time?\nDOCTOR: I don't think so. Not now you're off the ship.\nVIOLA: The Doctor says that the Master Clock is no use to them.\nCHARLEY: But they tested it. And you and I got through the mirrors with it.\nDOCTOR: You happened to have it with you. Not the same thing. The Clock is not the source of time energy that activated Learman's equipment.\nCHARLEY: Then what is?\nDOCTOR: I'm rather afraid that you are, Charley.\nCHARLEY: What!\nBOY: Look, it begins.\nDOCTOR: And ends.\nDALEK L: The time is out of joint.\nDALEK: Report!\nDALEK: 2: Temporal Extinction Device repaired.\nDALEK: 4: Projections indicate that time fissure resolution will be maintained.\nDALEK L: Time is come round. And where I did begin, there shall I end.\nDALEK: Pilot will maintain stability of this vessel within the vortex.\nDALEK: 4: Target coordinates set.\nDALEK: Deploy the device.\nDALEK: 2: Device launched. Locked on course.\nDALEK L: The dust on antique time would lie unswept.\nDALEK: 2: Countdown to detonation five, four, three, two, one.\nDALEK L: (simultaneously) Time, that takes survey of all the world, must stop.\nDALEK: 2: Detonation.\nDALEK L: Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!\nDALEK: 2: Temporal energy is released.\nDALEK: 4: Danger, danger. Time fissure destabilising.\nDALEK: Alert! Alert! Device operating outside safety parameters.\nDALEK: 2: Energy wave approaching. Fleet, this vessel is now endangered.\nDALEK: 4: Feedback building. Temporal grouping imminent.\nDALEK: Advise Imperial Command that the device has malfunctioned.\nDALEK: 4: I obey.\nDALEK: Deploy escape corridor. Activate full temporal shielding.\nDALEK: 4: Shielding activating. Hull integrity falling to seventy three percent.\nDALEK: 3: Temporal collapse estimated in twenty two Rels.\nDALEK: 2: Corridor locked on source of time fissure. Stability of corridor not guaranteed.\nDALEK: 4: Hull integrity falling to fifty one percent.\nDALEK: Pilot Dalek and Strategist to escape corridor.\nDALEK: 3: Temporal collapse in ten Rels. Hull stability failing.\nDALEK: 2: A temporal stabiliser element is required to restore hull integrity and dissipate time energy.\nDALEK: 3: Total collapse in seven Rels.\nDALEK L: Thus the whirligig of Time brings in his revenges.\nDALEK: 4: Pilot evacuating ship. Strategist squad one following.\nDALEK: Advise Emperor that our Strategists will implement rescue procedures.\nDALEK: 3: Three Rels.\nDALEK: 2: Escape corridor collapsing.\nDALEK: 4: Trapped in corridor. Alert! Alert! Gaaaaaah!\nDALEK: 2: Total temporal collapse imminent.\nDALEK: We will await rescue. We will await rescue. We will await rescue. We will await rescue. We will await rescue. We will await rescue. We will await rescue. (Ad infinitum)\nDOCTOR: To the last syllable of recorded time.\nBOY: Hoist by their own petard.\nDOCTOR: How very well put. You know, you have an evident knack for an apt phrase.\nBOY: Thank you, sir.\nCHARLEY: I remember who you are now, Will. Alas, poor Daleks. Does that mean it's over?\nVIOLA: Are the Daleks destroyed?\nDOCTOR: More sort of stuck for a while.\nBOY: Then what?\nDOCTOR: Oh, then they'll do it all again.\nVIOLA: Oh, a good plan, then.\nDOCTOR: One that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention.\nCHARLEY: So Time is safe, history is preserved, and young Shakespeare can go home.\nDOCTOR: Yes, indeed. And you too, Viola.\nVIOLA: Thank you. I've a feeling there will be a lot to sort out.\nDOCTOR: Right, Will, we'll take you back to Stratford now, or rather, then. If you see what I mean.\nBOY: Doctor, I have found I rarely understand your words or meaning.\nDOCTOR: Well, that's probably all to the good.\nCHARLEY: But what about me? What do we do about me?\nDOCTOR: I don't know, Charley. I really don't know.\nCHARLEY: But if I'm emitting some sort of time energy like you said\nDOCTOR: There's still a rent in the fabric of space time. The Web is unravelling strand by strand, pulled apart by a rogue source of temporal energy.\nCHARLEY: So I'm at the centre of it? The heart of the problem? All our recent problems?\nDOCTOR: The eye of the storm, the still point in the turning vortex.\nCHARLEY: What do we do? Can't we stop Time from falling apart and taking me with it?\nDOCTOR: I don't know.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, I'm scared.\nDOCTOR: So am I, Charley. So am I."
