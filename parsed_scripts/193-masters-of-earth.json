Do you ride?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been known to, in my youth. (BEAT) The Daleks let you come and go in the village as you please?\nKYLE: Pretty much. Lived in Laughlin all my life. Some of the lassies do laundry. I’m a mechanic by trade, fix up vehicles for ‘em.

(SIGHS, WEARY) Look, may I come in? It’s been a trying morning.\nKYLE: Aye, I suppose.\nKYLE: THEY GO INTO HOUSE.

Are there any weaknesses in security at the refinery, that you know of?\nKYLE: Having a laugh, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: I’ve never been more serious.\nDOCTOR: STOPPING IN KITCHEN.\nKYLE: Persistent, I’1ll give you that. (PICKING UP BOTTLE) — A wee dram, for your journey?\nDOCTOR: Ah, no thank you. But don’t let me stop you.\nGLASS: CLINKS, STOPPER PULLED, MEASURE POURED, THROUGH:\nKYLE: I shan’t force you. It’s me last bottle of the good stuff, this. Once it’s gone... Och, well. Slainte.\nKYLE: DRINKS\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Slainte. (BEAT) Now, about that refinery...\nKYLE: Well, why would I be knowing anything about that? I fix things, keep my head down, try to survive.\nDOCTOR: Admirable policy. What are we, ten years into Dalek occupation?\nKYLE: Meteorite bombardments came in... when was it, '52? Then came the sickness. Crosses on doors and 'Bring out your dead.' Daleks rode in six months later, like the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\nKYLE: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 26\nDOCTOR: Standard Dalek invasion strategy. Weaken, divide, conquer.\nKYLE: There’s resistance. The odd patrol brought down. Nothing to make any difference.\nDOCTOR: You'd be suprised. (BEAT) The refinery. You must know\nDOCTOR: something.\nKYLE: Place is tight as a drum. The Daleks are sucking the life out\nKYLE: of the Scotland, stripping the land like-\nDOCTOR: I know what the Daleks are doing.\nKYLE: Plenty go in. No-one comes out.\nDOCTOR: We’ll see about that.\nKYLE: You’re on a hiding to nothing, man!\nDOCTOR: Frequently. But that never seems to stop me. (TURNING) My thanks, Mr Inskip. I shan’t take up any more of your time.\nDOCTOR: WALKS DOWN HALLWAY.\nKYLE: Suit yourself.\nDOCTOR: OPENS DOOR.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) I’1l see myself out.\nKYLE: Suit yourself!\nDOCTOR: EXITS, CLOSING DOOR LOUDLY.\nKYLE: (TO HIMSELF) Hiding to nothing. — Still: Slainte.\nKYLE: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 27\nMOTORBIKE: ENGINE STARTS UP OUTSIDE.\nKYLE: What the-?!

SHUTTLE RAMP LOWERS, HATCH OPENS.\nDALEK: Move forward!\nDALEK: 2 x ROBOMEN MARCH FORWARD AHEAD OF PERI, ALAN, MOIRA, ROSS & 4 x OTHER SLAVES, FOLLOWED BY A DALEK. MOVING ON THROUGH:\nPERI: This place looks like hell.\nALAN: You got that right.\nMOIRA: The Daleks push the workers to the point of death, because if they die.. well, there are always more to be had.\nALAN: Sounds like every boss there’s ever been.\nROSS: What are they doing here? What do they even want?\nPERI: The Doctor knew to expect them here, on Earth, now. He must\nPERI: know what they’re up to.\nMOIRA: Know a lot about the Daleks, this Doctor of yours?\nPERI: More than anyone else in the universe, I should [think. ]\nDALEK: (BEHIND) Halt!\nALL: STOP.\nDALEK: Robomen will assign slave workers to work details.\nROBOMAN: #1: We obey.\nROBOMAN: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 30\nDALEK: These four will be held for physical assessment.\nPERI: Why aren’t we being assigned to a work detail?\nPERI: SWIVEL.\nDALEK: Do not question the Daleks!\nPERI: I wouldn’t dream of it.\nDALEK: Move!\nOTHER: SLAVES MOVED AWAY BY ROBOMEN. PERI, ALAN, ROSS AND MOIRA MOVED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.\nALAN: You need to learn to keep that geggy shut, little lady.\nPERI: Like that’1ll ever happen.\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 31\nPERI: A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM REFINERY. MOTORBIKE APPROACHES. ENGINE SPLUTTERS. BIKE COUGHS TO A HALT.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Ah. Well, I suppose I was lucky there was fuel in the tank to start with.\nDOCTOR: DISMOUNTS.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Mr Inskip, I’1ll be sure to return this transport of delight at the first opportunity.\nDOCTOR: TAKES A BREATH.\nDOCTOR: Shanks’s pony it is then, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: BEGINS TO WALK.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 32\nDOCTOR: OUTSIDE, INDUSTRIAL SOUNDS CAN BE HEARD.\nROSS: Why are they keeping us here? What does “physical assessment” mean?\nALAN: Be thankful we’re not out there with the others, up to your heid in industrial sludge.\nMOIRA: They’1ll be wanting to make sure we're of hardy Scottish stock before they put us to work.\nALAN: You seem to know a lot about it?\nMOIRA: Just a guess. Take a cross-section of your workers, make sure they’re up to it.\nALAN: You really think the Daleks care about our welfare?\nPERI: The Daleks may be cruel, but they’re not stupid. Moira’s right.\nMOIRA: Thanks. (MOVES TO SIT NEXT TO PERI) So, you and the Doctor came across the Daleks on... Necros, you said?\nPERI: It’s hard to believe, I know. You see, the Doctor has a ship. A very special ship.\nROSS: And the Daleks are out there, in space? Conquering other worlds?\nPERI: They never stop.\nMOIRA: And that’s what your Doctor does — fight them?\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 33\nPERI: Whenever he meets them, yeah.\nALAN: He was keeping well out of the way back there, in the village.\nPERI: I know. It’s weird. This time, he seemed... oh, I don’t know.\nALAN: Scared?\nPERI: No!\nROSS: He wasn’t scared to take you on, Alan Weir!\nALAN: (AMUSED) Oh! Found your backbone, have ye, thief? — Come on, then, wee man, I’1l take you on.\nPERI: Leave him alone!\nALAN: I suppose your Doctor will be coming to rescue us all by hisself? Our knight in multi-coloured armour?\nPERI: I’d like to think so! — Although... we were apart for a long time, until recently. Maybe he’s changed more than I thought.\nMOIRA: GETS UP.\nALAN: Where are you off to, now?\nFOOTSTEPS: ACROSS THE CELL.\nPERI: Moira?\nFIST: BANGS ON METAL DOOR.\nMOIRA: You out there! Robomen!\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 34\nPERI: What are you doing?\nPERI: GETS UP.\nMOIRA: I have information!\nALAN: (LAUGHING) She’s selling you out!\nPERI: (CROSSING TO MOIRA) Moira?

What did you do there, then?\nROSS: Wire on his helmet looked important. So I, um, ripped it out.\nMOIRA: Must have shorted out the control circuit or something. Smart.\nALAN: Lucky, more like.\nPERI: (TO MOIRA) You weren’t selling us out, Moira?\nMOIRA: Needed a way out. This Doctor of yours could be just the fella we need to lead the fight against the Daleks.\nPERI: I hope so. — C’mon, let’s go. It won’t take long for the Daleks to figure out what’s happened.\nMOIRA: COLLECTS RIFLE.\nMOTRA: At least we’ve got a weapon now.\nALAN: Good luck with that pop gun against a squad of Daleks.\nALAN: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 39\nROSS: You’re not thinking of staying here?\nALAN: Why not? Might sit and wait for this famous Doctor to turn up.\nALAN: Better than gettin’ killed as an escaped prisoner.\nMOIRA: They’11l only kill you for not stopping us escape.\nALAN: You reckon-?\nROSS: Oh aye.\nPERI: Your choice, Alan.\nALAN: Well, since you put it like that...\nMOIRA: Come on!\nALL: EXIT.\nALL: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 40\nREFINERY: SOUNDS, AS BEFORE.

We could have all been killed!\nROSS: But we weren’t, were we?\nMOIRA: (COMING OVER) Everybody OK?\nALAN: Is that it? Break’s over?\nMOIRA: Daleks don’t take breaks.\nDOCTOR: Quite. Night or day, we can’t stay still for long.\nMOIRA: I hear you know a lot about them, Doctor. The Daleks. Regular grudge match you’ve got going...?\nDOCTOR: (EVASIVE) Grudge... ? Well, why would anyone not have a grudge against the Daleks, Miss...?\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 61\nMOIRA: Sorry, we didnae have time for the social niceties. Moira Brody.\nALAN: (WHISTLES) You’re kidding, right?\nDOCTOR: The Moira Brody. Well, well, well.\nMOIRA: Seems I’m more famous than I thought.\nPERI: Why, are you some kind of celebrity?\nROSS: She’s — she’s with the resistance.\nMOIRA: I was, aye...\nROSS: You’re a hero!\nALAN: Troublemaker, more like. Causing grief for the rest of us who just want to keep our heads down. — (A THOUGHT) Hey! Way I\nALAN: heard it, there’s a price on that head of yours...!\nMOIRA: People say all sorts. But the Daleks didn’t realise who I was when the shuttle picked me up.\nALAN: Is that so? — Lucky, that.\nMOIRA: Luck had nothing to do with it. One captured work unit is the same as the next, so far as they’re concerned.\nDOCTOR: Interesting as this discussion is, we need to move on.\nALAN: Go where you like.

And make a bigger target?\nPERI: Doctor, what do you think?\nDOCTOR: Well, what I think [is —]\nMOIRA: We head north.\nALAN: North?! — Why?\nMOIRA: I heard there’s Dalek-free islands, up in the Orkneys. Folks like us, banding together, getting ready to strike back. Gathering up arms and armour, medical supplies...\nROSS: Food?\nMOIRA: Aye, of course.\nALAN: More to rob?\nPERI: Change the record, Alan.\nDOCTOR: The coast... that’s, what, some hundred miles or so?\nMOIRA: I reckon.\nROSS: The Orkneys, though.\nDOCTOR: I suppose, if it’s the last place we were thinking of going, it’s the last place the Daleks will be thinking of looking...\nALAN: Och, I was sittin’ pretty until you bunch of head-cases turned up on my patch! (BEAT, SIGH) Alright, alright... I’m in.\nALAN: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 63\nMOIRA: Keys, then. We drive in shifts.\nALAN: (FX: HANDS OVER KEYS.) Suits me.\nMOIRA: Ross, you join me up front.\nMOIRA: MOIRA, ALAN & ROSS MOVE AWAY.\nDOCTOR: (TO PERI) Well, then — best we climb aboard.\nPERI: I thought you wanted to run away back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: “Run away”?\nPERI: That’s what it seemed like.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING TO TRUCK) Believe me, Peri, the less you know about this particular episode in Earth’s history, the safer we’1ll be.\nPERI: (FOLLOWING) Thanks.\nDOCTOR: Please, trust me. It’s not what it sounds like. More than that I’m not at liberty to say.\nPERI: So we’re staying with this lot, why?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING AT TRUCK) Because I think they might need our help, to find safe passage to the Orkneys. And because — well, because the TARDIS is indisposed, for the time being.\nTRUCK: ENGINE STARTS UP.\nPERI: (OVER NOISE) What do you mean, ‘indisposed’?\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 64\nDOCTOR: Sunk in that peat bog.

We need water at least.\nMOIRA: AS ROSS AND ALAN DISEMBARK FROM OTHER SIDE OF CAB:\nDOCTOR: That I cannot argue with. — What a charming little village.\nPERI: “Drumkyld”.\nROSS: You know it, Peri?\nPERI: There’s a sign. “Drumkyld General Stores”.\nROSS: Aye, so there is! — (HEADS OFF)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Don’t go too far, any of you!\nALAN: You in charge now?\nDOCTOR: Does it matter?\nMOIRA: The Doctor’s right, we need to be able to get back aboard at a moment’s notice. — Look, just make yourself useful, will you?\nALAN: (SURLY) Yes, ma’am.\nPERI: JUMPS OFF BACK OF THE TRUCK.\nPERI: Come on, we’d better help them.\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 67\nDOCTOR: Many hands, yes.\nDOCTOR: JUMPS DOWN. THEY WALK.\nPERI: Place looks deserted. Like a ghost town.\nDOCTOR: I daresay it is. Like brutal barons of old, the Daleks have cleared the Highlands.\nPERI: Why?\nDOCTOR: Small communities make easy targets, rounded up in an afternoon. Very efficient. Very Dalek.\nPERI: I mean, what for?\nDOCTOR: Labour, for their industrial works. Not just here, down South as well. Oh, if Jamie could see this...\nPERI: What industrial works? What are they doing? (STOPPING) Doctor, tell me!\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) All right. This is the year 2163.\nPERI: I got that much. And the Daleks have invaded Earth.\nDOCTOR: A dark time. The solar system blockaded. Other worlds unable — or unwilling - to stand against the Dalek Empire. A decade of occupation that almost brought the human race to its knees.\nPERI: What happened?\nDOCTOR: I did.\nPERI: You were here before?\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 68\nDOCTOR: I will be. About a year from now, Earth will be liberated. I helped destroy the occupying Dalek force. And... I lost someone very precious that day...\nPERI: I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: Not like that, it was just time to say good-bye, but... What I’m trying to say is, this is... was my fight. But not here. Not now. It goes against everything I believe in — but to become involved, to actively fight the Daleks here...\nPERI: You’re worried about the, what do you call it, the Web of Time.\nDOCTOR: It’s not about the Web of Time, it’s about me! If the Dalek army of occupation was to identify me or the TARDIS now...\nPERI: . they might be ready for the other you who turns up a year from now.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. This terrible status quo must remain intact for my earlier self to tackle. — Listen to me, Peri. If I were to be\nDOCTOR: captured, and if the Daleks were to examine my memories... well, promise me you won’t let that happen.\nROUND: ABOUT NOW, ALAN & ROSS BEGIN ARGUING DOWN STREET.\nFOLLOWING: DISTANT DIALOGUE RUNS UNDER PERI & DOCTOR:\nFOLLOWING: [ALAN: What you got there, thief?\nFOLLOWING: [ROSS: (EATING) Biscuits. Still fresh.\nFOLLOWING: [ ALAN: (SNATCHES BISCUITS) You were going to scoff the lot weren’t you?\nFOLLOWING: [ROSS: Hey! — I was going to share! ]\nFOLLOWING: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 69\nPERI: How?\nDOCTOR: Peri...\nPERI: You don’t mean... No!\nDOCTOR: Well...\nALAN: (LOUD, TO ROSS) Liar!\nDOCTOR: Are those two at it again?\nCROSS TO: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 70\nALAN: Once a thief, always a thief! (SHOVES ROSS)\nBISCUITS: SCATTER ON THE FLOOR\nROSS: The biscuits, you’ve broken them!\nALAN: You’re pathetic.\nMOIRA: (RUNNING UP) Och, you two! Do I have to bang your heads together!\nALAN: Kid’s a liability.\nROSS: I’m sorry.\nALAN: Stop saying you’re sorry!\nMOIRA: Enough with the scrapping! We work together, or we die together. Which do you want, Alan — hey? Hey?\nALAN: Suppose.\nMOIRA: There’s a good boy. There’s a coupla crates of mineral water in the pub.\nROSS: Mineral water?\nMOIRA: I know, in Scotland. Tourists had to drink something. — Fetch\nMOIRA: ‘em together, the pair of you!\nMOIRA: AS ALAN & ROSS HEAD OFF, CROSS TO:\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 71\nPERI: Moira’s impressive.\nDOCTOR: She certainly is. And therein lies the problem — and part of the reason why we’re still here.\nPERI: You recognised her name, didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: The years following the liberation were nearly as tough. The Earth broken, world leaders slaughtered. The destiny of the planet hung in the balance and it needed strong people to lead the rebuilding — and healing.\nPERI: Moira’s one of those people?\nDOCTOR: The history texts of the time mention the leader of the Scottish resistance. Her name, Moira Brody.\nPERI: You think it’s our Moira?\nDOCTOR: It would be an enormous coincidence if it wasn’t.\nPERI: Why am I sensing an enormous ‘but’?\nDOCTOR: You know me so well. It’s why I wanted to leave before, but I think our presence here has already polluted the timeline. History records that Moira Brody was liberated from a labour camp — a refinery — at the end of the occupation...\nPERI: Not that she escaped a year before.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 72\nPERI: Now she’s out here, you’re worried something might happen, something that stops her from being part of the rebuilding?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. If the change is minor, time has a habit of washing its own wounds clean. Things remain on track, more or less. However, if Moira dies...\nPERI: We have to stay with her.\nDOCTOR: At least until she’s safe in the Orkneys.\nPERI: Then what? What if she raises her army a year early?\nDOCTOR: Once we’re safely there, I’1ll sit her down and talk to her.\nPERI: Well, what if she won’t listen?\nDOCTOR: Sssh, she’s coming over.\nMOIRA: (COMING OVER) What are you two in cahoots about?\nDOCTOR: Ohh, this and that. — Did you find anything?\nPERI: What was that?\nMOIRA: It’s alright, it’s just the boys finding what I found in the pub.\nDOCTOR: Which was?\nMOIRA: The landlord, danglin’ from an oak beam. Reckon he heard the Daleks were comin’, and...\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 73\nPERI: That’s horrible!\nMOIRA: Aye, well. Figured the boys needed remindin’ — fightin’ the Daleks is all there is. If we don’t do that, well...\nPERI: There are other ways to do it —\nMOIRA: Hey, do either of you sail?\nDOCTOR: I can’t claim to be a natural born matelot, but I know the ropes.\nPERI: What’s this about sailing?\nDOCTOR: Obvious, I’d have thought, Perpugilliam?\nMOIRA: Once we get to the coast, we’re going to have to find ourselves a boat.\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 74\nMOIRA: 39: RADIO BROADCAST\nDALEK: Attention, all humans.

Well, until recently.\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 75\nMOIRA: You had time apart?\nPERI: Lived a whole other life, apparently.\nMOIRA: I’m not following you.\nPERI: Don’t try.

Can you remember your father’s first name, for me? Peri Brown?\nPERI: No... no!\nDOCTOR: It was Paul.\nPERI: (REMEMBERING) Paul... Brown.\nDOCTOR: Paul Brown, that’s right. And your mother’s name was what?\nPERI: J-Janine.\nDOCTOR: Janine Brown. You were born in Baltimore, in the United States — and you’ve come so very, very far from home, haven’t you? With me.

I’m going to turn into one of them, aren’t I?\nDOCTOR: Keep fighting. Remember who you are. Who I am.\nMOIRA: Still — guess the sooner we get her away from this plantation, the better?\nDOCTOR: Their influence should diminish, yes. We need to get to the Orkneys as soon as possible.\nALAN: See over in the east? I reckon that’s the coast path. Two, three miles, I’m thinking...?\nDALEK: (IN FAR DISTANCE — REPEAT FROM 61) Humans! We know you are in the plantation.

Hold her, you two.\nDOCTOR: RANSACKING SHELVES.\nDOCTOR: Must be some here somewhere...\nCURBISHLEY: Some what?\nDOCTOR: Sedatives, Mr Curbishley, sedatives!\nALAN: What, like horse tranquillisers?\nDOCTOR: I’ll ignore that, Alan — (FINDS SOMETHING) Ah-ha!\nCURBISHLEY: That’1l1 do the trick, will it?\nDOCTOR: (DRAWING UP SYRINGE) It should keep her quiet, until I can find a more permanent solution.\nCURBISHLEY: I can suggest a more permanent solution.\nDOCTOR: Hold her arm out for me. — Mind the thorns!\nPERI: I must... must kill!\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 147\nDOCTOR: Sorry about this, Peri. But I don’t suppose it’1ll hurt.\nDOCTOR: That’s it. She’s going under. There.\nALAN: For how long?\nDOCTOR: Long enough, I hope. — Now, Mr Curbishley. You say you arrived here yesterday?\nCURBISHLEY: For all the good it did me. Place is deserted.\nALAN: Well, except for our murderous friend back there. You suppose he was the garage guy? Mr Home Surgery 2163?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be surprised, but I have a rather more urgent matter to attend to.\nCURBISHLEY: What? — You surely don’t expect to cure the woman here?\nALAN: It’s not the mange she’s got, you know!\nDOCTOR: No, it’s something her immune system hasn’t evolved to protect her against. But mine, I fancy, is a little more robust.\nALAN: Why? Proper blue blood, is it?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just say it has a certain extra elements.\nCURBISHLEY: What is it you propose?\nCURBISHLEY: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 148\nDOCTOR: A blood transfusion. My natural antibodies to bolster hers. It’ll take time to prepare, and I’1ll need you to help keep me awake throughout the process. Oh, and I’1l need iron!\nALAN: Iron what?\nDOCTOR: Sources of iron, good for the blood! Seeds, nuts, chocolate will do.\nCURBISHLEY: There’s a shop down the way. It’s probably been looted, but...\nALAN: I’ll go.\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) Thank you, Alan. I'd appreciate that.\nALAN: Don’t get excited, I’m not bein’ brave or nothing. It’s just I cannae bear the sight of blood.\nCURBISHLEY: You’d better hurry, before the whole parade goes up in smoke.\nALAN: Aye, aye. — Can I have your gun, Mr Curbishley?\nCURBISHLEY: No.\nALAN: Fine. Fine! (EXITING) I’1ll just risk my life fetchin’ the Doctor a boxload of choccy treats, shall I?\nSLAMS: DOOR BEHIND.\nCURBISHLEY: You’re a doctor? — Ah, so you do know what you’re doing.\nDOCTOR: Believe me, Mr Curbishley — I haven’t the first idea.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page\nALAN: RUNS UP OUTSIDE AND OPENS DOOR. BELL JANGLES.\nALAN: Wasn’t kidding about the looters. What a mess.\nALAN: MOVEMENT TO REAR.\nALAN: Someone out the back there? I can hear you, you know.\nMORE: MOVEMENT.\nALAN: Warning you, pal. I’ve got a gun...!\nFOOTSTEPS: THROUGH ‘PLASTIC STRIP’ DOORWAY.\nMOIRA: And you’re not afraid to use it.. Alan?\nALAN: You're kidding me!\nALAN: 149\nALAN: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 150\nDOCTOR: RIFLES THROUGH CUPBOARDS.\nDOCTOR: Came here to find paradise as well, did you?\nCURBISHLEY: I wouldn’t call it that.\nDOCTOR: I had a friend who did. So you’ve seen no sign of any kind of any organised resistance?\nCURBISHLEY: Unless you count those bodies you found. But if they couldn’t defend themselves against one man, how did they hope to take on the Daleks?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t be so sure. His strength was... incredible. Grip like a vice. (BEAT) Oh, where is Alan? Surely he must have found something by now.\nCURBISHLEY: I told you. There’s nothing out there. Go and see for yourself if you don’t believe me.\nDOCTOR: And leave Peri with you and your trigger finger?\nCURBISHLEY: Take my gun if you don’t trust me.\nDOCTOR: An excellent idea. Hand it over.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 151\nALAN: Moira?! Och, I don’t understand —\nMOIRA: There’s a surprise.\nALAN: But you-\nMOIRA: Drowned? Was left for dead? Take your pick.\nALAN: But the Slythers.\nMOIRA: Some idiot fired a flare at me.\nALAN: The Doctor. He wanted to see what was happening.\nMOIRA: Suppose I should thank him. Gave the Slythers the heebies.\nALAN: But where were you?\nMOIRA: Must have been dragged away from the boat. When I surfaced you were long gone.\nALAN: You could have shouted?\nMOIRA: And remind them I was there? No thanks. (SHE WINCES)\nALAN: What’s wrong with you?\nMOIRA: One of them got ma leg.\nALAN: Don’t show me, I cannae bear the sight of — (A THOUGHT) Hey,\nALAN: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 152\nALAN: how come you still managed to swim back to the shore? We were miles out.\nMOIRA: Stop your blathering and help me find a bandage or something?\nALAN: If it’s bandages you want, there’s yards’ worth over at the vet’s. That’s where the Doctor is, and Peri, and this other fella we met. I only came in here lookin’ for chocolate, like.\nMOIRA: Chocolate?\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 153\nDOCTOR: Look here, Mr Curbishley, we’ve only just met. If you think I’m\nDOCTOR: leaving you with Peri with a gun in your hand...\nCURBISHLEY: If you insist. Just to prove we’re friends.\nPASSES: GUN TO DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I choose my friends very carefully.\nCURBISHLEY: And your enemies?\nDOCTOR: Usually choose me. (AS HE EXITS) Stay here and watch Peri.\nDOOR: SLAMS BEHIND.\nCURBISHLEY: Oh, don’t worry. I won’t take my eyes off her.\nCURBISHLEY: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 154\nALAN: (HEFTING BOXES) Reckon that’s enough choccy biccies to keep even his nibs satisfied...\nMOIRA: Come on, you’d better show us the way to this vet’s, then.\nALAN: Och, you can’t miss it. Right by the burnt-out car. So much for your utopia.\nMOIRA: (OPENING DOOR — BELL JINGLES) I said there were no Daleks here. I didn’t say it was the Garden of Eden.\nFROM: OUTSIDE, WHINE OF MULTIPLE DALEK TRANSOLAR DISCS COMING INTO LAND.\nMOIRA: Oh no...!\nALAN: Daleks! Loads of them-!\nDALEK: #1: (OFF) Dalek patrol to control. We have reached human settlement.\nMOIRA: CLOSES DOOR.\nALAN: You said they weren’t here!\nMOIRA: Looks like I was wrong.

Surrender now, and you will not be harmed!\nDOCTOR: A likely story.\nDALEK: #1:\nDALEK: (FROM STREET) Resist, and you will be exterminated.\nDOCTOR: That’s more like it.\nCURBISHLEY: There’s a back exit.\nDOCTOR: Come on, help me with Peri.\nCURBISHLEY: Leave her here.\nDOCTOR: If you’re not going to help me carry\nDOCTOR: is open that door.\nDALEK: #1: This is your final warning.\nDALEK: OFF, 2 X PEOPLE RUNNING UP FROM REAR\nCURBISHLEY: her, the least you can do\nCURBISHLEY: OF HOUSE.\nCURBISHLEY: Did you hear that?

They’1ll never get through the front door anyhow.\nDOCTOR: That’s why they’re making a line. To concentrate their firepower.\nALAN: I don’t follow.\nMOIRA: If the little pigs won’t let them in, they’1ll huff and puff and blow the house down.\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, Peri, I’ve got you. — All of you!

The Daleks...\nPERI: I’m sorry.\nMOIRA: The Daleks made me like this. Gave me the strength to survive the Slythers. To make it back to shore. As I swam, I remembered.

You have 30 rels to give yourselves up.\nDOCTOR: You do realise you brought this all upon yourselves?\nBLACK DALEK: Explain.\nDOCTOR: Your Elite. Able to blend in perfectly. The ultimate double agents. You did your job too well. They infiltrated the enemy perfectly.\nMOIRA: (D) What’s it to be? Do you surrender?\nBLACK DALEK: No. You will all be exterminated!\nBLACK DALEK: THERE IS A QUIET HISS, LIKE GAS.\nMOIRA: (D) So be it.\nBLACK DALEK: Prepare failsafe.

Is that you?\nPERI: Live and kicking.\nMOIRA: The first survivor of the Dalek scourge.\nCURBISHLEY: RUNS UP\nCURBISHLEY: Moira, did it work?\nDOCTOR: (D) If you’re referring to the Daleks, they’re dead as the proverbial doornail. An airborne agent, developed by the Daleks in this facility, I presume?\nCURBISHLEY: Varga made virus.\nPERI: Varga?\nDOCTOR: (D) We found some of its victims in Stromness.\nMOIRA: Test subjects. The Daleks had yet to perfect the composition. I completed their work.\nDOCTOR: (D) Adding a little Dalek DNA into the mix. A targeted virus, with one race in its sights. Nasty...\nMOIRA: But effective.\nCURBISHLEY: Doctor, open the door. It’s still sealed.\nCURBISHLEY: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 196\nDOCTOR: (D) Opening a door?

When did you start to break your conditioning, Moira? When you shot that Dalek’s eye- stalk off? I see now, you had orders not to destroy — that’s why you “missed” all those Robomen — but give a beast a taste\nDOCTOR: of blood...\nPERI: She said on the boat.\nDOCTOR: (D) So after she killed Ross?\nPERI: What?\nCROSS TO: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 197\nDOCTOR: The weak link in the chain, eh Moira? Easier to push him into a Varga patch.\nMOIRA: (D) You knew all along?\nDOCTOR: No, not until your miraculous return from the depths.\nMOIRA: (D) It was the Daleks. They were-\nDOCTOR: Controlling you. Of course. (GETTING A HAND FREE) A-ha!\nPERI: (D) You’re free?\nDOCTOR: Getting there. Harry H would be proud. With you ina jiffy.\nMOIRA: (D) I didn’t want to do those things, Doctor. I had no choice.\nDOCTOR: You do now.\nCURBISHLEY: (D) We all do. The Daleks are finished.\nDOCTOR: I've heard that before.\nMOIRA: (D) The Daleks have given us everything we need.\nDOCTOR: Beat them at their own game, eh? (DROPS DOWN FROM THE SLAB) (TO HIMSELF) That’s better.\nMOIRA: That’s the general idea, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And that’s what worries me.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 198\nPERI: I recognise that tone, what’s wrong?\nDOCTOR: (D) What’s wrong is that I’m not convinced about our new friends’ motives.\nMOIRA: We are fighting for our freedom.\nDOCTOR: (D) Why do you want me to open the doors, Moira?\nMOTRA: To get you out.\nDOCTOR: (D) Really? What was that you said to the Black Dalek? You have become so much more. There’s only one reason you want me to open these doors...\nCROSS TO: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 199\nDOCTOR: You need my knowledge. About the Daleks and their plans.\nMOIRA: (D) (LAUGHS) We don’t need you. We have the virus.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Your ultimate weapon. The ability to wipe the Daleks from the face of the planet. Earth liberated in a few short moments. But it doesn’t happen that way.\nCURBISHLEY: (D) What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks don’t get wiped out. Not yet anyway. I was there when their schemes unravelled, when the people of Earth walked free.\nPERI: (D) I don’t see the problem. It happens early, so what?\nDOCTOR: It all depends what happens next. Isn’t that right, Moira?\nMOIRA: (D) (FORCEFUL) Open the doors.\nDOCTOR: You don’t want to unite the human race. You want to make them\nDOCTOR: like you.\nCROSS TO: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 200\nDOCTOR: (D) An entire planet of Robomen Elite. I can’t let that happen.\nMOIRA: It’s not your choice. It’1ll make us strong, make us able to stand up to the Daleks or anyone else for that matter.\nSHE: GRABS PERI.\nPERI: Hey!\nPERI: GAGS AS MOIRA WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER NECK.\nMOIRA: The door or I snap her neck.

How like a Dalek.\nCURBISHLEY: We are not Daleks.\nDOCTOR: You’re not human either. Stronger. More agile. Able to access the Dalek datanet?\nMOIRA: When we need to.\nDOCTOR: Impressive. But not the way it’s meant to be.\nMOIRA: None of this is how it was meant to be, but do you know what the invasion showed us?\nMOIRA: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 201\nDOCTOR: That you are not alone in the universe.\nMOIRA: That we’re sitting ducks. Do you know what it’s like to watch your own family die in front of you, Doctor? My Dad. He was always so strong. So alive.\nCURBISHLEY: Moira...\nMOIRA: I was holding him when he died. And I survived. One of the lucky ones, that’s what they told me. Until the Daleks started cherry-picking the survivors.\nMOIRA: INTO MOIRA’S HEAD...\nDALEK: (FLASHBACK EFFECT) You — mine duty. You — robotisation. You — research.\nDALEK: OUT.\nDOCTOR: You are not to blame for what the Daleks did to you.\nMOIRA: Aren’t we? The Daleks wiped the floor with us. The human race... Pathetic! Weak.\nDOCTOR: How little you know yourselves.\nCURBISHLEY: It’s changed now. We’1ll be ready.\nMOIRA: Stronger. Superior.\nDOCTOR: Familiar words.\nMOIRA: If you won’t help us, fine.

Everyone is going to willingly march into the robotisation chambers?\nCURBISHLEY: They won’t need to. The Daleks will do it for us.\nPERI: What?\nMOIRA: The pilot has been deemed a success. It is about to be rolled out across every continent. One hundred per cent conversion.\nCURBISHLEY: The Daleks estimate that the entire population of Earth will be converted within a month.\nPERI: And then you release the Varga virus.\nMOIRA: The Daleks will be gone and Earth will be ready to defend itself.\nDOCTOR: As if that will be enough. You won’t be able to stop yourself.\nMOIRA: We know what’s out there now.\nPERI: Might as well take the battle to them?\nDOCTOR: Watch out. The human race is coming. And you thought the Daleks were bad.\nMOIRA: The Daleks are dead. They just don’t know it yet.\nMOIRA: THE ROBOMEN GASP AS A DALEK VOICE BOOMS OVER THE SPEAKERS.

The Elite programme has failed.\nDOCTOR: It’s more than that, isn’t it? Your Elite Prime was going to kill me.\nSUPREME DALEK: (D) You have displayed impossible knowledge about Dalek strategy. You are an unknown element.\nDOCTOR: Always.\nSUPREME DALEK: (D) Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Oh. You’11l know soon enough.\nSUPREME DALEK: (D) You will identi-—\nSUPREME DALEK: THE DOCTOR KILLS THE COMMS LINE.\nPERI: You knew they’d do that, didn’t you?\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 206\nDOCTOR: I had an inkling.\nPERI: Keeping your hands nice and clean.\nDOCTOR: I had to do something. If Moira had won, the damage to the timeline—\nPERI: That’s alright, because nothing’s changed. (BITTER) Least of all you.\nDOCTOR: And what would you have me do? Have Moira and her Elite march across the galaxy, claiming it as their own? Exterminating anyone in their path.\nPERI: What makes it your choice?\nDOCTOR: You have no idea, have you? Even after all this time. I had the chance once, to wipe the Daleks out for good. To stop their very creation.\nPERI: (WRONG-FOOTED) Well, why didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: The Daleks are evil. But they exist. It’s not for the likes of me to sign their death certificate. Or for the likes of Moira to take their place.\nDOCTOR: A KLAXON SOUNDS\nPERI: Is that what I think it is?\nDOCTOR: More Daleks.\nPERI: And they’1l be here soon?\nPERI: THE DOCTOR PRESSES BUTTONS.\nPERI: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 207\nDOCTOR: They must find nothing of the research. Best they think all this is a failure and leave well alone.\nPERI: Think that’1l happen?\nDOCTOR: They’1l return to it in future. Infiltrators. Replicants. It’s a matter for history, but not yet. I just need to wipe all the records from the datanet, including any mention of visiting Doctors...\nPERI: Then what?\nDOCTOR: Dangerous things, Dalek power systems. Liable to overload.\nPERI: When given a helping hand.\nDOCTOR: You read my mind.\nDOCTOR: A WHINE DEEP IN THE BASE AS THE GENERATORS BUILD.\nDOCTOR: There!\nPERI: Now what?\nDOCTOR: The transolar disc bays, come on.\nPERI: You’re kidding me.\nDOCTOR: You know, I’ve always wanted to fly one.\nDOCTOR: HE RUNS FROM THE ROOM, PERI FOLLOWING. CROSS TO:\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 208\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR RUNS UP AND JUMPS ON A TRANSOLAR DISC. THE WHINE IS\nNEAR: CRITICAL.\nPERI: Still not happy about this.\nDOCTOR: Peri, this entire facility is mere rels away from exploding. So unless you can suggest an alternative? A flying carpet, perhaps?\nPERI: (STEPPING ON) Alright. Sarcastic.\nDOCTOR: Then hold on!\nDOCTOR: HE FIRES THE TRANSOLAR DISC. IT ROCKETS INTO THE AIR. PERI GASPS AND GRABS THE RAIL.\nDOCTOR: Going up, up and away...!\nDOCTOR: . AND AS THEY FLY OFF: THE DALEK BASE EXPLODES. FADE.\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 209\nDOCTOR: FADE UP. RECOVERY VEHICLE REVVING, TYRES SLIPPING IN MUD. KYLE IS USING IT TO PULL THE TARDIS OUT OF THE MUD.

Yes. About, er, twelve miles that-a-way?\nKYLE: What, by the Dalek refinery?\nKYLE: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 210\nDOCTOR: Fancy a second-hand trans-solar disk in exchange? One careful owner?\nKYLE: Why, I oughta—\nDOCTOR: Alternatively: inside my police box, I do happen to have a caseful of whiskey... purely medicinal, for emergencies only.\nKYLE: Whiskey, eh? — Good stuff, is it?\nDOCTOR: I’m no connoisseur, but I’ve heard Altairean whiskey described as the finest measure in the four galaxies.\nKYLE: (RELEASING DOCTOR) Well, now. That’d be a civilized exchange, I'd say. — C’mon, then, get her open.\nKYLE: So what happened, exactly, once you got to the refinery?\nDOCTOR: We were saved.\nPERI: By Moira Brody.\nKYLE: Never heard of her.\nDOCTOR: You will do. (STOPPING, AT DOOR) She didn’t just save us, Kyle. She saved you all.\nPERI: The Daleks were planning to convert everyone into Robomen.\nKYLE: Everyone in Scotland?\nDOCTOR: (OPENS DOOR) In the world. She stopped it. — Look, I need to\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 211\nDOCTOR: pop in here a moment. Peri, tell Mr Inskip all about Moira Brody, will you?\nPERI: Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: As we discussed. Quite sure. (DISAPPEARS INSIDE)\nKYLE: Where is she now then? This Moira?\nPERI: Still out there, fighting the good fight. Trying to bring about the end of the Daleks. Do me a favour, will you, Mr Inskip?\nKYLE: Aye, what’s that?\nPERI: Tell everyone. Your friends. Your family. Anyone who’1ll listen. Tell them that Moira Brody’s on her way. Tell them that she’s their salvation.\nKYLE: Aye, maybe I will.\nDOCTOR: (REAPPEARS AT DOOR, CASEFUL OF CHINKING BOTTLES) .. There you go, Mr Inskip. One entire caseful of Altairean whiskey, as promised. The good stuff.\nKYLE: (DELIGHTED) Slainte!\nDOCTOR: We’ll be off now.\nKYLE: Where?\nPERI: In the box, of course.\nKYLE: You’re off your heads.

Tell the world!\nDOCTOR: MASTERS OF EARTH by Cavan Scott & Mark Wright (003 NB) Page 212\nPERI: You’re sure you’re OK with that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. Altairean whiskey: rotgut to an Altairean. To humans, as non-alcoholic and reviving as the water from a Highland spring.\nPERI: No, I meant — telling him about “Moira Brody, the great saviour”.\nDOCTOR: Kyle will tell the others. With luck, they’1l tell more. Before long, the name Moira Brody will be on everyone’s lips. The great hope. The new Rob Roy.
