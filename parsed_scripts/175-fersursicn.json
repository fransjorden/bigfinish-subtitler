And what are you drinking?\nWILL: It’s a pint of something called “Lusty Pikeman”. I admit it: I was taken with the title.\nKLEIN: I thought you weren’t going to have anything alcoholic?\nWILL: It wasn’t planned. I did order a lemonade but the barman gave me such a dirty look when I asked that I... buckled. Peer pressure, I suppose. If one considers a very large man with a shaved head and a lot of tattoos one’s peer. I don’t know. Was that rude? It wasn’t supposed to be rude. (FX: PUSHES PINT ASIDE) I’1l just leave it, I think.

When you say “nothing to be alarmed about” do you in fact mean “Something to be really quite alarmed about”?\nKLEIN: Not at all. It’s not a formal meeting. Not as such.\nWILL: Right. (BEAT) Actually, if it’s all the same to you, could I record it anyway?\nKLEIN: Now, why on earth would you want to do that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 7 of 129\nWILL: Well. You know. So I can have a record of it. See if I can’t work out where I’m going wrong.\nKLEIN: As I said, this isn’t a formal meeting.\nWILL: Forgive me, ma’am, but it does sound a little like a formal meeting to me.\nKLEIN: Fine. Be my guest. Record whatever you like.\nWILL: Thanks. I’1ll use my regular Dictaphone.\nKLEIN: I have to say: that Dictaphone has won you few friends.\nWILL: Really? Why’s that?\nKLEIN: If you need to ask...\nKLEIN: WILL TAKES A DICTAPHONE FROM HIS POCKET, LAYS IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE THEM AND PRESSES RECORD. HE SPEAKS INTO IT.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Recording. Recording. One two three. These are the audio minutes of a meeting held in the Huntsman pub in Clapham Junction at eighteen hundred hours on the twenty- seventh of September. Present are Science Officer Elizabeth Klein (Ph.D) and Junior Science Officer William Arrowsmith. (BEAT) There.\nKLEIN: Right. OK. It has been put to me in the past that I can be too formal in my manner. The word “frosty” has been used. As has “aloof”. As has “unapproachable”.\nWILL: I find that hard to believe.\nKLEIN: So I thought we’d have this conversation out of the office. In more relaxed surroundings.\nWILL: Good idea. You can’t beat a bit of team bonding.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 8 of 129\nKLEIN: This is not intended as a review of your performance, let alone a disciplinary. Though officially, you are still on probation, of course.\nWILL: Oh, I’m quite aware of that. The sooner I get to become a fully-fledged member of staff, the better.\nKLEIN: And that’s what I wanted to talk to you about.\nWILL: You’re not happy with my work?\nKLEIN: Your theoretical work is excellent. Your papers are superbly researched. Your knowledge is extensive. At times, you’re a positive databank. Yet your practical contributions... Your work in the field...\nWILL: I am trying, Dr Klein.\nKLEIN: I know. But I don’t suppose I really have to mention the debacle in Bangalore? The beached Temperon at Yarmouth Pier? The heat vampire who, thanks to your inaction, is still at large in Mexico City?\nWILL: I am learning. From all my mistakes.\nKLEIN: I know. I know you’re doing your best. It just occurred to me that I ought to have a friendly word with you. Our organisation is very large. You don’t have to work in the field. There are research posts. Desk jobs which might be more suited to your particular skills. (BEAT) I’m sorry, Mr Arrowsmith. (BEAT) I am trying to help. (BEAT) I know this must be disappointing but, really, I think you could at least show some sign that you’re listening to me.\nWILL: Sorry. I didn’t mean to be rude. Don’t turn around, but I think he’s here. Watching us from over by the bar.\nKLEIN: Who’s here? Who’s watching us?\nWILL: You know who, Dr Klein. Him.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 9 of 129\nKLEIN: (BEAT) Which version?\nWILL: The little one. With the straw hat.\nKLEIN: The umbrella man.\nWILL: According to everything we have on file, he’s generally considered the most dangerous of them. Would you agree with that?\nKLEIN: No comment. But what’s he doing here?\nWILL: Could be a coincidence.\nKLEIN: Where he’s concerned, there’s no such thing.\nWILL: Right. He’s standing up.\nKLEIN: Is he coming over?\nWILL: No. No. He’s turning away. (FX: OFF, DOCTOR PULLS OPEN DOOR AND EXITS. DOOR SWINGS SHUT) He’s leaving.\nKLEIN: I’m going to follow him. His being back means serious trouble.\nWILL: I want to go with you. I want to meet him.\nKLEIN: No. You report in. Tell them we’ve got a new blue box incident underway. Can you do that?\nWILL: Of course, but I’d rather come [with you]\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 10 of 129\nKLEIN: I think we’ve established you’re not a field man, Will. So I’m giving you a direct order. Understood?\nWILL: Understood.\nKLEIN: I’m going after him. (BEAT) You can turn that thing off now. And wipe the tape.\nWILL: Goodbye, Dr Klein!\nWILL: WILL WAITS UNTIL SHE LEAVES. THEN HE PICKS UP THE DICTAPHONE AND SPEAKS HURRIEDLY INTO IT.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Klein has left the building. (BEAT) And I’ve taken an executive decision to disobey my orders and follow her. Show her what I can really do in the field. (STARSTRUCK) Besides — that was him. The Umbrella Man. The Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 11 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3. EXT. STREET\nDOCTOR WHO: FOLLOWS.\nKLEIN: Doctor! Doctor, wait!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR HURRIES ON.\nKLEIN: Doctor! Slow down!\nKLEIN: THE DOCTOR SHOWS NO SIGN THAT HE HAS HEARD HER.\nKLEIN: Curse the man.\nKLEIN: SHE HURRIES AFTER HIM.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 12 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4. EXT. PUB\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL EMERGES FROM THE PUB, SPEAKING EXCITEDLY INTO HIS DICTAPHONE.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) This is Will Arrowsmith in pursuit of Elizabeth Klein who is herself in pursuit of a person whom I think we’re\nWILL: able to identify, pretty conclusively, as our former scientific advisor. I’m going after them.\nWILL: SCENE 5. EXT. FURTHER ALONG STREET\nWILL: A MOMENT’S SILENCE, THEN RECORDING RECOMMENCES.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Arrowsmith here. We’ve been walking for about ten minutes, but at least it’s stopped raining. We’ve left the high street and we’re heading up Lavender Hill. For a moment I thought we were going towards the station but no, we just kept on walking. So far I’ve not been spotted.\nWILL: THE MACHINE IS SWITCHED OFF. A MOMENT’S SILENCE, THEN...\nWILL: SCENE 6. EXT. BY BATTERSEA ARTS CENTRE\nWILL: THE MACHINE IS SWITCHED ON AGAIN.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Right. We’re by the Battersea Arts Centre (of all places) where we seem to have come to a halt. And I’ve just seen why. The TARDIS is here. I’d have thought it’s pretty unignorable but people seem to be passing by without giving it a second glance. It’s wonderful to finally see it for myself. The Doctor’s gone inside and Klein has followed. The door’s been left ajar. I hardly dare approach it.\nWILL: Oh. Oh, the stories are true. It really does feel... alive.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 13 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nKLEIN: Doctor? Doctor? I know you’re here, in your Ship. (BEAT) Where are you hiding?\nKLEIN: TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 14 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. EXT. BY BATTERSEA ARTS CENTRE\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) I know this is in direct contravention of my orders but I hope it will show some real initiative on my part. I’m going in.\nWILL: SCENE 9. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Ah. Right. This is a later version of the flight deck so it’s all very Victorian. Well, pseudo-Victorian. Inspired by The Time Machine but rather more by the film version, I’d have said, than by the actual book. No sign of Dr Klein. Nor of our erstwhile Scientific Advisor. I suppose I should go back now. I ought to make my report. But I can’t help myself. I think I’m going to go further in.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) And since the doors have just slammed shut it’s\nWILL: not like I have much choice.\nWILL: TENTATIVELY, HE WALKS THROUGH THE CONSOLE ROOM AND INTO THE TARDIS.\nWILL: TO DEMATERIALISE.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 15 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. INT. TARDIS — STAR CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: KLEIN ENTERS A HUGE ROOM WITH A GLASS WALL WHICH LOOKS OUT, IN THE MANNER OF AN AQUARIUM, ONTO A GREAT SEA OF STARS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTOR IS STANDING BEFORE THE GLASS, WATCHING.\nKLEIN: (WALKING UP) At last. There you are.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: What is this place?\nDOCTOR: I call it the Star Chamber.\nKLEIN: That’s uncharacteristically literal of you. (BEAT) What am I looking at here?\nDOCTOR: A minor galaxy from the Tier of Ragged Restoration, out towards the universal core. It was under threat from an insatiable intelligent virus. So I materialised my Ship around the stars and prevented their destruction.\nKLEIN: You keep an entire galaxy in one room in your TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: At the moment, yes, I do.\nKLEIN: Is it safe?\nDOCTOR: From here, behind the glass. Perfectly. (BEAT) Probably.\nKLEIN: I’ve some questions to ask you.\nDOCTOR: You sound stressed, Elizabeth. You really ought to spend more time like this. Like me. Just gazing at the stars. It gives one a tremendous sense of perspective.\nKLEIN: What were you doing in London? Why were you spying on me?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 16 of 129\nDOCTOR: Spying? I just didn’t want to intrude.\nKLEIN: But if you’re here.. that means bad news, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: You know, I’m really not used to this reaction when I drop in unannounced on old friends. They’re usually overjoyed to see me. (BEAT) Well, most of them. (BEAT) Some of them.\nKLEIN: You're being evasive.\nDOCTOR: Evasive? Does that really sound like me?\nKLEIN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: The truth is I only dropped by to see that you were well and thriving. You have my old job, after all. I never expected you to come after me. Never dreamed you'd follow me into the TARDIS.\nKLEIN: You were only dropping by? You’ve not brought any extra- dimensional horrors with you?\nDOCTOR: Not this time. (BEAT) But seeing as you’re here, why not join me on a trip or two?\nKLEIN: You have no companion at present?\nDOCTOR: Not at present.\nKLEIN: Where’s Raine?\nDOCTOR: She is.. elsewhere. I’m quite alone. So how about it? A quick sprint about the universe?\nKLEIN: I have responsibilities, Doctor. I can’t just take off on some intergalactic jaunt.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 17 of 129\nDOCTOR: Ah. Then I rather think I owe you an apology.\nKLEIN: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because the TARDIS has been in flight for the past five minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 18 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. INT. TARDIS — A LONG, EMPTY CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DICTAPHONE IS SWITCHED ON AGAIN.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) I think the Ship might be moving. It’s very strange. There’s the sensation of flight but not in the same way you’d feel it in a car or a plane. I suppose it has to do with the nature of whatever it is we’re passing through. My heart rate has increased and I’ve started to perspire. I admit I didn’t expect to find this so alarming. I’ve already passed numerous peculiar rooms full of the most bizarre and unexpected things. I’ve seen cupboards the size of cathedrals and what I think must have been a fridge-freezer full of vegetarian food which extended as far as the eye could see. There are libraries stacked with impossible books. A cinema showing films in five dimensions. Though I’ve yet to see the slightest sign of the Doctor or Klein. Somehow, being here, it feels more like stepping into a man’s mind than into a real place. OK. I’m going to try another door.\nWILL: WILL OPENS THE DOOR AND STEPS GINGERLY INTO...\nWILL: SCENE 12. INT. TARDIS — JUNGLE ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nWILL: . WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DENSE PATCH OF JUNGLE.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) This is really very odd.\nWILL: WILL MOVES FURTHER INTO THE ROOM.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) I think I’m probably slightly afraid now.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE, HOARSE, BLAIR WITCH STYLE WHISPER) And I think there might be something in here with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 19 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. INT. TARDIS — STAR CHAMBER\nKLEIN: Have you kidnapped me?!\nDOCTOR: Of course not. What a ridiculous suggestion. Am I the sort of person who goes around kidnapping people? Is that really my modus operandi?\nKLEIN: You lured me aboard your Ship, then you took off without my consent!\nDOCTOR: The dematerialisation was not of my doing. You know how temperamental the TARDIS can be. Since her refit she’s grown positively mercurial.\nKLEIN: You should take me back at once.\nDOCTOR: ‘Should’, Elizabeth? You don’t sound sure. (BEAT) Admit it, you’re curious. You wonder what will be on the other side of the doors when my TARDIS lands.\nKLEIN: (WAVERING) I don’t deny I feel a certain, natural level of curiosity.\nDOCTOR: Ah. And there we are. The TARDIS has materialised. It can only have been a short hop. Won’t you accompany me to the console room, to see where we’ve ended up? (BEAT) Surely you want to know?\nKLEIN: Well, I suppose —\nDOCTOR: You’re like me, aren’t you? You always want to know.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 20 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. LARGE BARREL ON SEA\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL IS IN ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE ROOM IN THE TARDIS. IT LOOKS LIKE A ROOM TO HIM BUT IT IS IN FACT A LARGE WOODEN BARREL ADRIFT ON AN OCEAN CONTAINED WITHIN THE TARDIS. WILL DOESN'T KNOW IT YET, BUT HE’S ONLY A FEW FEET FROM SHIPWRECK.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DICTAPHONE IS SWITCHED ON AGAIN.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Right. I’m in a small oval room which seems to be made entirely of wood. It sounds absurd but I think whatever I’m in is actually floating on water somehow. It’s as though we’ve gone to sea. I’ve not got the faintest idea how or where or (exactly what)-\nWILL: WATER POURS IN.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 21 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: FLIPPING SWITCHES.\nKLEIN: So? Where are we?\nDOCTOR: The outskirts of Diisseldorf, Germany, May 1945.\nKLEIN: Dusseldorf?!\nKLEIN: Just one month after the city was liberated by American forces. By the view from outside, we’re somewhere underground. It all seems terribly quiet. Shall we take a stroll?\nKLEIN: You’re quite sure the TARDIS has brought us here of her own volition?\nDOCTOR: From time to time she has these little whims.\nKLEIN: And you played no part in it?\nDOCTOR: How could I have done? You know me. I’ve never really been able to control my Ship. She’s always had a mind of her own.\nDOCTOR: You see? Even the doors boss me around.\nDOCTOR: PAUSES. TURNS BACK.\nDOCTOR: Coming?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 22 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. TARDIS — ANOTHER LONG CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: SODDEN WILL WALKING. SQUELCHING, DRIPPING FOOTSTEPS. THE DICTAPHONE IS SWITCHED ON AGAIN.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) I can’t say this has been the easiest day. But I shan’t forget it in a hurry. I suppose I was lucky to crash into that jetty. I’ve found my way back to the central corridor now and it looks very much as though we’ve landed. The Doctor and Klein must be somewhere nearby.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 23 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17. INT. LARGE, HANGAR-LIKE AREA IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nKLEIN: (WALKING TO STOP) Where are we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You tell me.\nKLEIN: You expect me to recognise this place?\nDOCTOR: I expect you to observe. I expect you to deduce.\nKLEIN: Well, you were right. We are underground. Some sort of scientific establishment, I think.\nDOCTOR: Very good.\nKLEIN: German, of course. It seems badly damaged. Deserted so I’d say it was evacuated. And it must have been ransacked. Judging from all this ash that’s underfoot they tried to torch the place. Looters, do you think?\nDOCTOR: Looters? Or liberators? Heroes or opportunists? Who can say? It’s history who chooses. And she’s a most unreliable judge.\nKLEIN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: The question is: was the looting random or did it have a purpose? This is Europe after the war, remember. The victors are doing everything they can to acquire the secrets of those who lost.\nKLEIN: Scientific secrets, you mean?\nDOCTOR: All of the Allies — British, American, Russian alike — are engaged in a sordid competition to secure the greatest minds in Nazi Germany for themselves.\nKLEIN: You think that’s what’s happened here? Some sort of raid for tech and knowledge?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 24 of 129\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ve no idea. Ignore me. I’m just thinking aloud.\nKLEIN: It’s a plausible enough hypothesis. If it hadn’t been for Nazi science, America wouldn’t have won the moon race.\nDOCTOR: And didn’t Wernher have trouble with the prototype?\nKLEIN: I suppose you were there.\nDOCTOR: I will be.\nKLEIN: Doctor?\nKLEIN: DOCTOR? Hmm?\nKLEIN: What’s that? Someone’s daubed something on the wall.\nKLEIN: THE FAR WALL MORE CLOSELY. THE DOCTOR FOLLOWS.\nKLEIN: It says “Struwwelpeter”. That’s a German word. Shouldn’t the TARDIS have translated it?\nDOCTOR: As I said. She’s in a whimsical temper. But you evidently recognise the phrase.\nKLEIN: Yes. It means “Shockheaded Peter”. From a book by Heinrich Hoffman. A cautionary tale for children about a boy who wouldn’t cut his hair or trim his nails. He becomes a kind of monster. My mother read it to me when I was small.\nDOCTOR: Did she now? We tell our children such strange stories.\nKLEIN: My parents were German, you know. They brought their stories with them. They came over after the war. It can’t have been easy for them.\nDOCTOR: No, it wasn’t. But they were brave people. Mutte and Ralf.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 25 of 129\nKLEIN: (SHARPLY) How do you know my parents’ names?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m the umbrella man... remember?\nKLEIN: So you have been checking up on me. Creepy, Doctor. Decidedly creepy.\nDOCTOR: You were telling me about “Struwwelpeter”.\nKLEIN: I haven’t thought about it in years. What’s it doing here?\nDOCTOR: I’ve not the slightest notion.\nKLEIN: Oh, so this is another coincidence? Like the TARDIS bringing me to this country, in this time?\nDOCTOR: Coincidences in the universe are like confetti at a wedding. Now shall we go on? I usually find that exploration leads to answers. Of one kind or another.\nKLEIN: Yes, I should very much like some answers.\nDOCTOR: After you, then, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: (RESIGNED) Fine, Doctor. Fine.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 26 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DICTAPHONE IS TURNED BACK ON AGAIN.\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) Right. Back in the control room. Hallelujah. Only it’s empty. The logical conclusion is that the Doctor and Klein have gone outside the TARDIS, wherever that [may be]\nWILL: Ah. This might be them now.\nWILL: SCENE 19. INT. LARGE, HANGAR-LIKE AREA IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nWILL: Doctor? Dr Klein? Hello?\nWILL: (INTO DICTAPHONE) No, no sign. In that case, I’m left with two choices. The first is to remain in the TARDIS, in relative safety. The other is to go out. Into the field. (BEAT) Wish me luck.\nWILL: HE TURNS THE DICTAPHONE OFF.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 27 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20. INT. RANSACKED LIBRARY IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nDOCTOR: I wonder, was this a library?\nKLEIN: There’s that word again. Daubed on the wall. “Struwwelpeter”.\nDOCTOR: “Just look at him! there he stands, With his nasty hair and hands.\nDOCTOR: See! his nails are never cut;\nDOCTOR: They are grimed as black as soot; And the sloven, I declare,\nDOCTOR: Never once has combed his hair; Anything to me is sweeter\nDOCTOR: Than to see... Struwwelpeter.”\nKLEIN: That’s it! That’s just how the poem goes. (BEAT) But why on earth have you memorised it?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t know I had. No idea where it came from. It just popped into my head.\nKLEIN: I don’t like seeing that word up there somehow. Not in this place. It seems, I don’t know. It seems... ominous.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 28 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21. INT. GLOOMY DEAD-END CORRIDOR IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nDOCTOR WHO: AT THE END OF A LONG CORRIDOR, IN A SECRET COMPARTMENT, HINTERBERGER IS WAITING.\nDOCTOR WHO: FROM HINTERBERGER’S POINT OF VIEW, WE HEAR WILL APPROACH.\nWILL: (BEYOND PANEL, CALLING OUT, APPROACHING) Doctor? Dr Klein? I’m very sorry, but it’s Will Arrowsmith here!\nWILL: EMERGES, SHAKING WITH RAGE.\nHINTERBERGER: Get out! Go away! Leave!\nWILL: (SURPRISED) Aagh! (BEAT) You really scared me, jumping out of the wall like that. —\nHINTERBERGER: Why have you come back here? Why do you people persist on coming back? He’s not here anymore. You understand me? He has gone.\nWILL: Sorry. I don’t mean to intrude. I’m looking for a couple of friends. Well, I say friends. One’s more of a colleague. The other I’ve never met before today. Though I’ve read a lot about him.\nHINTERBERGER: Who are you? Where are you from?\nWILL: My name’s William Arrowsmith. People generally call me Will.\nHINTERBERGER: You are English?\nWILL: Yes. And from the look of this place you’re presumably German. Now, no doubt you’re wondering exactly how it is that we can understand one another. I have a little of your language but not nearly enough to approach this level of fluency. No, what it is is the telepathic circuits of the TARDIS which enable us both to (understand one another)-\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 29 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: Enough of this gibbering!\nWILL: Sorry, was I gibbering? It’s just me in the field, being rubbish. Or so I’m told.\nHINTERBERGER: Be quiet! You should not be here. He’s gone. You understand me? He is gone.\nWILL: Well, I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t mean to cause offence. I'd just like to find my friends and leave.\nHINTERBERGER: Oh yes. Yes. You will leave. You shall go where many others have gone before you. Into the cool embrace of death!\nHINTERBERGER: OFF.\nWILL: Oh no. Really?!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 30 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22. INT. RUINED LABORATORY FURTHER INTO COMPLEX\nDOCTOR WHO: DOXTOR AND KLEIN WALK IN, CRUNCHING OVER BROKEN GLASS.\nKLEIN: Looks like a laboratory of some sort. Or at least, it was.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Whoever ransacked it did a decent job.\nKLEIN: They laid fires in here, judging by this ash. They were thorough. The whole place is just... torn up.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I wonder what they were searching for. (BEAT) Or who.\nKLEIN: There’s something I’m missing in all this, isn’t there?\nDOCTOR: I shouldn’t have thought so. You’re usually very perceptive.\nKLEIN: Right. Well, if there’s nothing else, we’ll just go home then, shall we?\nDOCTOR: (TOO QUICKLY) No. Not just yet.\nKLEIN: Why? There doesn’t seem to be anything to see.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you want to discover what happened? Don’t you want to find out who daubed those words on the walls? Don’t you want to know what went on here?\nKLEIN: I’m not certain that I do.\nDOCTOR: But there are so many questions. What was the nature of their experiments? What were they trying to achieve? And why were they drinking milk out of test tubes?\nKLEIN: What?\nDOCTOR: I do believe that’s milk over there. It certainly looks like milk. Though in a laboratory like this you never can tell.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 31 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: MILK AND SNIFFS.\nDOCTOR: Definitely milk. (BEAT) And definitely rancid too.\nKLEIN: Does any of it really matter? The place is obviously completely abandoned. It seems clear to me that we’re the only people [here. ]\nDOCTOR: You were saying?\nKLEIN: (GOING BACK TO DOOR) Come on, then. —\nDOCTOR: You’re running towards a gunshot?\nKLEIN: You were right, Doctor. I am like you. I always have to know.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 32 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23. INT. GLOOMY DEAD-END CORRIDOR IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nWILL: Please. Put down the gun. I’m sure it going off like that was just an unfortunate mistake.\nHINTERBERGER: No mistake. You leave now. Or the next time I will aim for your heart.\nWILL: Why? Why would you want to kill me?\nHINTERBERGER: I’m. trying to do the right thing. I have always tried to do the right thing. It wasn’t supposed to end like this. Not in such confusion! We were all so certain once. As the Fiihrer was also...\nHINTERBERGER: TOWARDS HINTERBERGER. KLEIN, MORE CAUTIOUS, HANGS BACK.\nDOCTOR: Your Fihrer is dead. Your dreams of conquest have come to nothing. And your empire lies in tatters.\nHINTERBERGER: Who are you? Keep back. All of you.\nKLEIN: Will? What on earth are you doing here?\nWILL: I’m showing initiative, ma’am. In the field. (HE CRUMPLES) I can explain.\nKLEIN: You’re going to have to.\nDOCTOR: (TO HINTERBERGER) You’re quite alone here, aren’t you? The war’s over and you’ve been left behind. Hiding like a rat. But you can’t skulk forever. You know in your heart the time has come to give yourself up.\nHINTERBERGER: No! I won’t let you take me away! I’1l shoot every one of you first! I will! Don’t push me to it!\nKLEIN: Doctor. Will. You should back away.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 33 of 129\nDOCTOR: I know what I’m doing. (TO HINTERBERGER) Mein Herr, we've not come to hurt you or take you away. We’re here to help.\nHINTERBERGER: Wait. You. The Fraulein in the shadows. Step forward. Step forward, I say!\nKLEIN: I presume you’re referring to me.\nHINTERBERGER: Am I dreaming? Is it really you, returned? Oh, but how glorious it is to see you again!\nHINTERBERGER: Here. Take my gun. I lay it gladly before you.\nKLEIN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (MOCK-INNOCENT ) Klein?\nKLEIN: You need to explain exactly what’s going on. Right! Now!\nKLEIN: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 34 of 129"

My Shepherdess?\nSHEPHERDESS: My gentle lord?\nSHEPHERD: What wretched place is this? What ruined world? ‘Tis not as any newborn plane should be.\nSHEPHERDESS: I fear the fault is mine, my noble Lord.\nSHEPHERDESS: For I didst make us tarry at the end.\nSHEPHERDESS: I could not stem the voicing of my heart\nSHEPHERDESS: And feared that should we pass into the Gate, We both would altered be and so forget.\nSHEPHERD: Thou needst not claim the fault, my tender one. Friend Sylph! Speak truth. What is this wretched place?\nSYLPH: We have arrived too late, my noble lord. We waited too long by the Gate. And so we have emerged millennia after our intended point of entry.\nSHEPHERDESS: Sweet Sylph. You sound forlorn. This place doth seem To fill thee up with dolour and with grief.\nSYLPH: My lady, I ought not to possess emotion, being made as I am from lightning and air and living metal. Yet my gleaming heart doth sicken at the sight. This is not a world which was meant to be. Without your counsel this universe hath fallen into ruin.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 35 of 129\nSHEPHERD: Pray, gentle Sylph. Thou must not say ‘tis so. We'll heal this place. Show wisdom. Bring it light.\nSYLPH: I fear you are too late, my noble lord. I was not meant to live in such a world as this. So it is with sorrow that I choose the balm of death above this barren plane.\nSHEPHERDESS: No, no, sweet Sylph. I order thee to stay.\nSYLPH: My choice is made. I have sent instructions to the engine which is within me to commence my self-destruction.\nSHEPHERD: Please, our sweet Sylph!\nSHEPHERDESS: We beg you. Leave us not.\nSYLPH: I am sorry, my lady. I am sorry, my lord. The order has been given. It cannot be rescinded. And so, farewell.\nSHEPHERD: We may yet come to understand his act.\nSHEPHERDESS: We must be strong, my love. We must be bold. Let us descend from this high, airy place And see ourselves how gravely lie the wounds Upon this sad, decayed and blasted world.\nSHEPHERDESS: TOWARDS THE CITY.\nSHEPHERD: It is a conurbation of some sort. A city that is filled with sounds of war.\nSHEPHERD: CELEBRATING THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.\nSHEPHERD: (WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE CROWD BUT NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO THEM AS TO MAKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY’RE SAYING. )\nSHEPHERD: So these must be the peoples of this world.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 36 of\nSHEPHERDESS: They joyful seem. Possessed by pride and zeal. And yet I think them poor misguided things. The taint of evil hath on them been laid.\nSHEPHERDESS: Now hark, my noble lord. What do they say?\nSHEPHERDESS: NOW WE HEAR WHAT THE CROWD ARE CHANTING.\nCROWD: Ein reich, ein volk, ein Fiihrer! Ein reich, ein volk, ein Fiihrer!

GLOOMY DEAD-END CORRIDOR IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nDOCTOR WHO: REPRISE FROM SCENE 23:\nHINTERBERGER: Wait. You. The Fraulein in the shadows. Step forward. Step forward, I say!\nKLEIN: I presume you’re referring to me.\nHINTERBERGER: Am I dreaming? Is it really you, returned? Oh, but how glorious it is to see you again!\nHINTERBERGER: Here. Take my gun. I lay it gladly before you.\nKLEIN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (MOCK-INNOCENT) Klein?\nKLEIN: You need to explain exactly what’s going on. Right! Now!\nDOCTOR: What an excellent question. I only wish I knew myself.\nKLEIN: I don’t believe you. You always know more than you’re telling.\nWILL: The files do suggest that to be true. (BEAT) I’m Will Arrowsmith, by the way.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Mr Arrowsmith. I’m the Doctor.\nWILL: (BLUSHES) I know who you are.\nDOCTOR: (TO HINTERBERGER) And who are you, Mein Herr?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 38 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: My name is Lukas Hinterberger. But I will not speak with you. Only the lady.\nDOCTOR: The lady is with me.\nKLEIN: Rather presumptuous of you.\nDOCTOR: Herr Hinterberger. Perhaps you can help. We’re looking for someone. Do you know a man named Schalk?\nKLEIN: . Kurt Schalk?\nHINTERBERGER: (IRONIC LAUGH) Oh, Fraulein. I see now, you are this man’s captive. You must be.\nDOCTOR: The Fraulein is here of her own free will.\nKLEIN: Apparently.\nHINTERBERGER: Ach, is there nothing you creatures will not stoop to? (SAD) Bringing her here, to me to get me to talk?\nWILL: I don’t understand. How can he have met Dr Klein before?\nKLEIN: Good question, Mr Arrowsmith.\nDOCTOR: Quiet, both of you. (TO HINTERBERGER) Herr Hinterberger. You don’t seem surprised, to be asked about Schalk.\nHINTERBERGER: You are not the first to come looking for Kurt.\nWILL: Others have been here?\nHINTERBERGER: Many others.\nKLEIN: Who? The British? The Americans? The Russians?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 39 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: All of them have come through here. But there have been stranger visitors also. Stranger by far.\nWILL: You mean visitors not of this earth? Extraterrestrials?\nKLEIN: Yes, thank you, Will.\nHINTERBERGER: So many impossible creatures have come scuttling and oozing through this place. But the worst of them... Oh. Do you want to hear about the worst of them?\nHINTERBERGER: NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING TO THIS.\nWILL: Well, I’m quite curious.\nHINTERBERGER: The worst of them, the worst by far... were the Struwwelpeter.\nKLEIN: So it’s you who’s been daubing that word all over the place? Why?\nHINTERBERGER: Because of an old story from my childhood. As a warning. And also, somehow, as an offering.\nKLEIN: Who are they, these Struwwelpeter? What did they want?\nHINTERBERGER: You had better ask your “friend”. He seems to understand.\nKLEIN: I think he means you, Doctor. Now why doesn’t that surprise me?\nDOCTOR: Were they all looking for Schalk, Herr Hinterberger?\nHINTERBERGER: You know that they were.\nKLEIN: (EXASPERATED) For goodness’ sake. What is it about this “Schalk”, Doctor? Who exactly is he?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 40 of 129\nDOCTOR: Patience, please, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: I have been patient [enough! ]\nKLEIN: BASE.\nWILL: Wait. What’s [that sound-?]\nWILL: AN INSANELY CHEERFUL FEMALE VOICE ISSUES FROM HIDDEN SPEAKERS.\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Hey guys. This is a big hello from all of us here at the Khlecht Entity Inc.\nKLEIN: Some sort of recorded message...\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Now we’re all really excited here at the Khlecht marketing and public relations department to be sharing with you the awesome news that, after our exploration of the 1945 zone of the Earth city of Diisseldorf, we’ve decided to explode a Stret-Zeeoni Bomb in the base where you’re currently standing.\nWILL: A bomb? Why?\nDOCTOR: Quiet!\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Why? To keep things nice and tidy now we’ve left. That’s just the kind of folk we are here at Khlecht. We don’t just like to leave a place the way we found it. We like to leave it better.\nKLEIN: I’ve heard of them. The Khlecht Entity. I mean I’ve read something about them, in the UNIT casefiles.\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) (SPEAKING HURRIEDLY NOW) Terms and conditions apply. Please see our site on the Intergalactic Meganet for further details. Khlecht take no responsibility for any accidental bipedal collateral damage. (CALMER AGAIN) Thanks for taking the time to hear this message. You have a great day now!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 41 of 129\nDOCTOR: The Khlecht. A race of space-faring asset-strippers.\nKLEIN: But what were they doing here — in Diisseldorf, in 1945?\nHINTERBERGER: Why, they were here for the same reason as you!\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Hi guys! Us again! Just a quick message to let you know that the countdown’s been initiated. Detonation of the Stret-Zeeoni Bomb will take place in just about... five minutes.\nHINTERBERGER: That voice! It said there is a bomb!\nWILL: Dr Klein? You don’t suppose it’s a bluff of some sort...?\nKLEIN: I know you’ve read the casefiles too. The Khlecht are renowned across the galaxies for their no-nonsense efficiency. So no, I don’t suppose they are.\nHINTERBERGER: Why are you all being so calm?!\nDOCTOR: Herr Hinterberger. Were you here when the Khlecht arrived?\nHINTERBERGER: I was. I saw them. Though they did not see me. They have many arms. Many legs. And darkness where their eyes should be.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. They’re most disagreeable. But did you happen to notice where they planted their bomb?\nHINTERBERGER: I saw nothing. I sought refuge underground.\nKLEIN: You mean you were hiding?\nKHLECHT VOICE: Hey there. Just checking in to let you know the detonation will take place... in four minutes and thirty seconds.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 42 of 129\nWILL: She sounds pretty sure about that. Shouldn’t we just pop back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: And why would you want to do that, Mr Arrowsmith?\nWILL: I thought we could escape. Get away before the explosion. (BEAT) Sorry. Is that a totally daft suggestion?\nKLEIN: Will’s not a field agent. He’s more of a theorist. Aren’t you, Will?\nDOCTOR: I’m not prepared to abandon Diisseldorf to the Stret-Zeeoni Bomb. I want to preserve this city — not replace it with a smoking crater.\nWILL: I thought it was probably something like that. I was just playing Devil’s advocate, really.\nKHLECHT VOICE: You’ve got four minutes now, guys. Four minutes!\nHINTERBERGER: I think we are all going to die here.\nDOCTOR: Mr Arrowsmith?\nWILL: Hello.\nDOCTOR: Dr Klein said you’ve read the files on the Khlecht?\nWILL: Well, I’m familiar with the basics.\nDOCTOR: Good. Then I have complete faith in you.\nWILL: About what?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 43 of 129\nDOCTOR: You know what this is?\nWILL: Sonic screwdriver. Looks like a new model.\nDOCTOR: And have you made a thorough study of it?\nWILL: Since you mention it.. I’m not sure you ever knew this but you once left one of the old models in your lab. We’ve been able to reverse-engineer at least some of its functions.\nKLEIN: Will!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, Dr Klein. I’ve known about that project of yours for some time. In fact, I always wanted somebody like Mr Arrowsmith to understand the workings of the device.\nWILL: Why?\nDOCTOR: Catch!\nWILL: What am I supposed to do with this?\nDOCTOR: Find the bomb and defuse it.\nWILL: How do I do that?\nDOCTOR: Use your initiative. You’re in the field now.\nDOCTOR: It’s picked up a trace of Stret-Zeeoni energy. You must follow\nDOCTOR: it to its source.\nWILL: Really? You honestly want me to handle this?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 44 of 129\nDOCTOR: I should hurry, Mr Arrowsmith. If I was you.\nHINTERBERGER: You won’t be able to stop it now!\nWILL: Dr Klein?\nKLEIN: (BEAT) I’m prepared to trust the Doctor’s judgement.\nKLEIN: IS ACTING LIKE A RADIATION DETECTOR.\nWILL: It seems to want me to go.. this way. Right. Well, wish me luck.\nWILL: SCREWDRIVER.\nKLEIN: (TO THE DOCTOR) I hope you know what you’re doing.\nKHLECHT VOICE: Three minutes, guys! This is your three minute warning!\nDOCTOR: (TO HINTERBERGER) Three minutes to live, Herr Hinterberger. And you’ve nothing left to lose. So why don’t you tell us where to find Kurt Schalk?\nHINTERBERGER: I’1l tell you nothing. (BEAT) But her. I think I could tell her the truth.\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Would you mind speaking to him, Elizabeth? Herr Hinterberger seems more... sympathetic towards you.\nKLEIN: (ASIDE) First I want to know exactly who this Kurt Schalk is and just why you’re so keen to find him.\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Later. I promise. But right now — the clock is ticking.\nKLEIN: (ASIDE) Fine. But I really don’t know why he’d want to say anything to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 45 of 129\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Oh, I don’t know. I think you underestimate your powers of persuasion.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 46 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26. INT. RUINED STAFF CANTEEN IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL IS TRYING TO BEST TO DEFUSE THE NEUTRON BOMB. THE DEVICE IS SEMI-ORGANIC IN NATURE.\nDOCTOR WHO: HELPFUL BLEEPS FROM THE SONIC SCREWDRIVER.\nWILL: Right. I’m in what seems to be an abandoned staff canteen carpeted with ash in a deserted underground bunker in Diisseldorf in May, 1945 and I’m trying to defuse a sort of weird organic alien bomb.\nKHLECHT VOICE: Head’s up, guys! Just one minute to go now! One minute!\nWILL: So here’s the thing. I’ve read enough about Khlecht technology to have some idea of how this tangle of elements should work.\nWILL: We captured a little of their tech in the Crookback Incursion\nWILL: of ‘84. Still, this isn’t the model I’m familiar with. So I’m\nWILL: reduced to making an educated guess.\nKHLECHT VOICE: Forty-five seconds now! It’s really hotting up!\nWILL: I can’t be certain which of these two parts I should remove. Should I pull out this thing which looks a bit like a miniature kidney? (FX: DOOR OPENS QUIETLY IN B/G — DOCTOR STEPS IN, UNNOTICED) Or should I tug on this grisly sort of umbilical cord? The sonic’s annoyingly noncommittal. (BEAT) I’m going to go with my gut. And I think, I’m almost certain, that it’s going to be... the umbilical cord.\nWILL: WILL LEANS FORWARD, ABOUT TO TUG AT THE UMBILICAL CORD. SUDDENLY, THE DOCTOR APPEARS BEHIND HIM.\nDOCTOR: No! Not the cord. The kidney.\nWILL: Doctor? How long have you been standing there?\nDOCTOR: I’ve just arrived. Now take out the kidney.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 47 of 129\nWILL: Yes. Yes, of course. (HE LEANS FORWARD AND REMOVES THE KIDNEY) There. (BEAT) Did it work?\nKHLECHT VOICE: Oops! We’re sorry but something seems to have gone wrong. We can’t detonate the Stret-Zeeoni Bomb right now but we’l1l be back in touch as soon as we’ve figured out how to fix it. Thanks for your patience, guys!\nWILL: It’s over?\nDOCTOR: A message like that is the Khlecht’s way of admitting total defeat.\nWILL: I’m sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Why are you apologising, Mr Arrowsmith?\nWILL: I was going to pull the umbilical cord. If you hadn’t been here we’d all be... ash by now.\nDOCTOR: I would never have let that happen. You should have more faith. Besides, you did well to narrow down your decision to only two possibilities. Very well, in fact.\nWILL: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: It will get easier. With experience. With time.\nWILL: (SLIGHTLY BEWILDERED) Right. Thanks.\nDOCTOR: And speaking of time, we’re running out of it. Rather an occupational hazard, I’m afraid, if you’re going to keep company with me. We should find out how Dr Klein is getting on.\nWILL: You left her alone with that madman?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 48 of\nDOCTOR: She’1ll be quite safe. Herr Hinterberger seems to like her.\nWILL: I noticed that. I don’t suppose you’ve any idea why?\nDOCTOR: Come on. We can find out for ourselves.\nDOCTOR: Incidentally, did I hear you talking to yourself earlier?\nWILL: No. I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: I think I did.\nWILL: Sometimes I like to record my thoughts.\nDOCTOR: But you weren’t recording them then?\nWILL: No. No, I wasn’t, as it happens. It just helps me to relax.\nDOCTOR: You’re an unusual young man, Mr Arrowsmith.\nWILL: Yes. I get that a lot.\nWILL: 129\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 49 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27. INT. GLOOMY DEAD-END CORRIDOR IN UNDERGROUND BASE\nDOCTOR WHO: HINTERBERGER AND KLEIN ARE HAVING A RATHER AWKWARD CONVERSATION. HINTERBERGER IS SLUMPED ON THE FLOOR. KLEIN, WITH DISTASTE, IS STANDING OVER HIM.\nHINTERBERGER: I think it was one of your English writers who said that “history is a nightmare from which we are trying to awake.”\nKLEIN: Irish, actually. But go on.\nHINTERBERGER: He spoke sense. That is how the world seems to me now. All this emptiness and failure and ash. Like a nightmare from which I must awaken.\nKLEIN: But it’s not a nightmare is it, Herr Hinterberger? This is real. Everything your leader planned came to nothing. The empire’s fallen and you’re just hiding in the ruins.\nHINTERBERGER: There was a time when I did believe — and believed absolutely — in what this country could achieve. But then...\nKLEIN: I’m afraid that gullibility is no excuse.\nHINTERBERGER: Oh, but I think you understand. You too have known the sweet joy of zealotry.\nKLEIN: I most certainly have not!\nHINTERBERGER: (THOUGHTFUL) No. No, I do not believe that you have. Of course. (HARD) I see now that you are not who I first took you to be.\nKLEIN: So who did you think I was? When we met. You laid down your gun at the sight of me.\nHINTERBERGER: I was mistaken.\nKLEIN: You were more than mistaken, Herr Hinterberger. You genuinely believed I was someone else entirely. But who?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 50 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: (ARCH) The question is not “who?”, Fraulein — rather, “how?”\nDOCTOR: Ah, Elizabeth. There you are. Did you persuade him to talk?\nKLEIN: He’s told me where this Kurt Schalk is, yes.\nHINTERBERGER: He is far from here. In a place that is remote and inaccessible. Where his many enemies will never be able to find him unless he wishes them to.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nHINTERBERGER: I was Kurt’s assistant. I was one of his assistants. And I am proud to say that I remain his friend.\nDOCTOR: Are you now?\nHINTERBERGER: We worked together closely for many years.\nDOCTOR: You're suddenly very confidential, Herr Hinterberger. Dr Klein must have been most persuasive. So where is Schalk?\nKLEIN: On the Greek island of Minos.\nDOCTOR: Minos?\nWILL: It is quite obscure. Just about the furthest island from the mainland. Not without significance in Greek mythology, however. [I think —]\nHINTERBERGER: The boy is right. It is small and it is most obscure. That is why it was chosen.\nDOCTOR: I see. Well, thank you for cooperating, Herr Hinterberger. In the end. (BEAT) Dr Klein. Mr Arrowsmith. I am going to Minos. Do you intend to accompany me?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 51 of 129\nWILL: Yes. Of course. Absolutely.\nKLEIN: Do we have a choice?\nDOCTOR: You always have a choice. Though I don’t recommend staying too long in this part of the world at this moment in her history.\nKLEIN: Then let’s go. And you can tell us on the journey exactly what it is that’s so important about this Schalk.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Goodbye, Herr Hinterberger.\nHINTERBERGER: Take me with you. Please.\nWILL: Why would you want to come with us? You were waving a gun in our faces half an hour ago.\nHINTERBERGER: I was wrong. I see now that there are things I have to face.\nKLEIN: That has to be one of the least convincing changes of heart I’ve ever heard. And I’ve heard plenty.\nHINTERBERGER: Believe what you will, Fraulein. But you will need someone on the island, will you not? Someone who knows Kurt Schalk. Someone who can lead you to him.\nWILL: He does have a point. (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You may come with us, Herr Hinterberger. You may show us to Schalk. I make no promise after that.\nKLEIN: You can’t be serious! You’d really let a Nazi aboard your TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: You’d be surprised. Besides, it’s not for us to dispense justice.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 52 of 129\nKLEIN: That’s rich coming from you.\nDOCTOR: I also happen to believe that travel broadens the mind. This way.\nHINTERBERGER: You have your vehicle nearby?\nWILL: Oh, just you wait, Herr Hinterberger. It’s a vessel that travels through time and space. In fact, it’s called “Time and Relative Dimensions in Space” or “TARDIS” for short. [It dematerializes with a strange, wheezing groaning sound and it often arrives just as a crisis is about to start and]\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 53 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28. EXT. BEACH ON MINOS — BY WOODEN SHACK\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BEACH IS OTHERWISE DESERTED.\nDOCTOR WHO: SHACK. SHE KNOCKS.\nCASTA: Kurt! Kurt! Are you in there?\nCASTA: OUT ONTO THE SAND.\nSCHALK: Yes. Hello, Casta. Here I am. Could you shout my name just a little louder, please? I think there is an old woman on the other side of the island who did not quite catch every syllable.\nCASTA: We’re completely on our own here. Except for the birds in the sky and the fish in the ocean.\nSCHALK: Exactly. And can we trust the birds? Can we trust the fish? They might be watchers. They might be spies.\nCASTA: Kurt? Have you been drinking?\nSCHALK: For medicinal purposes only. But listen, my darling, you have no idea about the nature of the things that are searching for me. They have a million different ways to find me.\nCASTA: I’m not your darling. And I’ve probably got more idea about what’s looking for you than you think. You’ve told me about them often enough. Your monsters.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 54 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: HINTERBERGER AND WILL ARE ALONE IN THE CONTROL ROOM.\nWILL: So by my calculation, Mein Herr, twenty-three separate alien races came looking for your friend Kurt Schalk, not to mention sundry parties from England, Germany and the United States.\nHINTERBERGER: That is correct. I saw them all. Though none of them discovered me. Not even the little stumpy troll-like men with faces like potatoes.\nWILL: Yes, yes. We know all about them. Most of the others, too. But these Struwwelpeter. They’re completely unknown to us.\nHINTERBERGER: They were the worst of them. The greatest in raw power. Their memory lingers in my dreams. Somehow... I feel sure I’1l see them again. (BEAT) And, Herr Arrowsmith, that you shall see them too.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 55 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30. INT. TARDIS — STAR CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ROOM.\nKLEIN: I thought I’d find you in here. Stargazing.\nDOCTOR: I was just gathering my thoughts. How are Mr Arrowsmith and Herr Hinterberger getting along?\nKLEIN: Surprisingly well under the circumstances.\nDOCTOR: They’ve not touched anything on the console?\nKLEIN: Of course not. They’re under strict instructions.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nKLEIN: I can’t help thinking you’re avoiding me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’m not avoiding anybody. I’m planning my next move.\nKLEIN: You promised me an explanation. About everything that’s happened in the past few hours. About who this Kurt Schalk is and why we’re so desperate to find him.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) I don’t want you to think too badly of me, Klein.\nKLEIN: Why do you say that? Doctor? Doctor, what have you done?\nDOCTOR: This is not an easy thing for me to say-\nDOCTOR: ARE ALMOST THROWN TO THE FLOOR.\nKLEIN: What was that?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 56 of 129\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS took an emergency evasive manoeuvre. We must have hit something in the vortex. Which shouldn’t be possible since we’re moving only in space and not in time. (HE RUNS TOWARDS THE DOOR). This way!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 57 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31. EXT. BEACH ON MINOS — BY WOODEN SHACK\nCASTA: Here. I’ve brought you food and some water.\nSCHALK: Casta. You are my darling.\nCASTA: Come on, Kurt. Get yourself away from this awful hovel you’ve been hiding in and come and have something to eat. We could eat on the beach if you like. And afterwards, we could take a walk. To the village, perhaps.\nSCHALK: No. I am not yet ready to take that risk.\nCASTA: There’s no risk. Not really. Not anymore. But eat. Eat and then see how you feel. People in the village... they’re reasonable people.\nSCHALK: I wish you would stop trying to persuade me.\nCASTA: Oh well, if you’d rather not see me... I’ll just leave your food here. You can eat it by yourself.\nSCHALK: No. Of course I should like you to stay. You are right. We shall eat together by the ocean. And afterwards... you can have my decision.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 58 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nWILL: Doctor? What was that?\nHINTERBERGER: History does not care for your ship, I think, Doctor. She toys\nHINTERBERGER: with it like a giantess.\nHINTERBERGER: SWITCHES AND TAKING READINGS.\nDOCTOR: That’s a very colourful analogy, Herr Hinterberger. But perhaps\nDOCTOR: of limited relevance at the present time.\nKLEIN: Doctor? What caused that collision?\nDOCTOR: There’s a Spivelyn scout ship in orbit around this planet.\nWILL: Spivelyn? Why? What would they want?\nDOCTOR: Or “who”, Mr Arrowsmith. Who do they want?\nDOCTOR: Hold on, all of you! This might be a bumpy landing!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 59 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33. EXT. BEACH ON MINOS\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTA AND SCHALK HAVE FINISHED EATING LUNCH TOGETHER.\nSCHALK: I’m sorry if I seem distracted, Casta, my darling. Your picnic was wonderful. It is only this solitude which does not agree with me. It makes me lose my perspective.\nCASTA: Kurt. We have spoken about this before and I thought you understood — that I am not now and never have been “your darling”.\nSCHALK: You were once. You could be again.\nCASTA: I think that’s unlikely.\nSCHALK: Ah! It is that spirit of yours which I adore.\nCASTA: Kurt. You can’t stay here forever.\nSCHALK: I know. I am merely... regathering myself.\nCASTA: So why don’t you come with me to the village? The shadows have passed from Minos now. Things are once more as they used to be. Long ago.\nSCHALK: Perhaps. Yes, perhaps. I think I could surrender now... to the Americans or to the British.\nCASTA: Yes. You could. You are an important man.\nSCHALK: I am, aren’t I? And, as I think you know, I can usually turn any situation to my advantage.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 60 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34. INT.

It doesn’t agree [with you. ]\nSCHALK: (AS IF IN PAIN) Aaaargh!\nCASTA: Kurt! For the gods’ sake. What’s the matter with you?\nSCHALK: Forgive me, my darling. It was no meant as no slight upon your picnic. I was affected... by a tearing of the veil. A sundering of two entirely different modes of being.\nCASTA: Kurt, you’re scaring me now. What are you talking about? What\nCASTA: do you mean?\nSCHALK: That sound, it heralds Their arrival.\nCASTA: Whose arrival? Kurt?\nSCHALK: The creatures from beyond. They are coming for me.

Where hast thou been? What hast thou brought about?\nSHEPHERD: I hath been abroad in this sad city\nSHEPHERD: And I have seen such strange and awful sights.\nSHEPHERD: The people of this place, they see us now\nSHEPHERD: More clearly than before. More than they ought. When I do walk the streets they sense me there\nSHEPHERD: And start — not quite in terror or in fear\nSHEPHERD: But with a kind of troubling disquiet\nSHEPHERD: As though a thing from some old dream doth flick’r Weirdly at the edges of their vision.\nSHEPHERDESS: Oh, but the sights of this benighted place Hath filled thy soul with sadness and despair.\nSHEPHERD: All is foul and thick with death and fury.\nSHEPHERDESS: And I have felt it too, my love as I\nSHEPHERDESS: Have here sat and heard the wretched clamour\nSHEPHERDESS: Of war and of a world made black by sin.\nSHEPHERDESS: Now on us too hath evil set to work,\nSHEPHERDESS: Our hair hangs lank, our nails long and foul. We’re gods no more but half-remembered things Beset by mould and grime and turned to flesh. Worse still, my love, I fear our hunger grows We soon must feed on that which now doth thrive.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 63 of 129\nSHEPHERD: Speak not of that. I dare not think on it.\nSHEPHERDESS: Yet thou must feel it too? Thy appetite?\nSHEPHERD: Not yet. Not yet. Such measures are for when We lose dominion o’er our base desires.\nSHEPHERD: For now, my love, we never must succumb.\nSHEPHERD: As I’ve traversed this city I have seen\nSHEPHERD: A way to set this ruined world aright,\nSHEPHERD: Turn back the tides of wickedness and sin\nSHEPHERD: To make this world and then the universe\nSHEPHERD: In some approximation of all that\nSHEPHERD: We knew before — old beauty, former grace.\nSHEPHERDESS: Then thou must tell me of this scheme, my love.\nSHEPHERD: In certain of my mournful wanderings, Have heard I of a man whom we may use As happy vessel for our fondest hopes, And as a focus for our grand desires.\nSHEPHERDESS: His name, my lord? What is this good man called?\nSHEPHERD: Kurt Schalk, my lady. ‘Tis a simple thing Yet with that name shall all creation ring.\nSHEPHERD: TITLE MUSIC CRASHES IN!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 64 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37. OLIVE GROVE ON MINOS\nDOCTOR: An olive grove, Herr Hinterberger. Yes, this must be the island in question?\nDOCTOR: HINTERBERGER LOOKS AROUND HIM.\nHINTERBERGER: I cannot be certain. But I think that it is so. (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nHINTERBERGER: Are we safe? From the... Spivelyn ship?\nDOCTOR: They’1l be long gone by now.\nHINTERBERGER: How can you be sure?\nDOCTOR: Because they saw my TARDIS. And because they will have remembered our last encounter.\nHINTERBERGER: They fled at the merest glimpse of you?\nDOCTOR: They did.\nHINTERBERGER: May I ask why?\nDOCTOR: Oh, modesty forbids.\nHINTERBERGER: The war could have been very different with that machine of yours. Did you never think to choose a side on which to fight?\nDOCTOR: I don’t use my TARDIS to fight wars, Herr Hinterberger. I use it to end them.\nHINTERBERGER: So you say. Yet... how different things might have been.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 65 of 129\nDOCTOR: Things can always have been different. (BEAT) Now — (RAISES VOICE, BACK INTO TARDIS) — once our two friends have finished their conspiratorial chat over the console — (NORMAL TONE) — we\nDOCTOR: can get started. I’m really very eager to make the acquaintance of your friend Kurt Schalk.\nHINTERBERGER: No.\nDOCTOR: What?\nHINTERBERGER: I won’t help. I can’t.\nDOCTOR: Why not? Why have you changed your mind?\nHINTERBERGER: Because... I am confused and I am afraid.\nDOCTOR: We’re all afraid, Mein Herr. The trick is not to give in to it.\nHINTERBERGER: That is easy for you to say. With your impossible machine. With your technology and power.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Lukas, you’ve been afraid, I think, for all your life.\nHINTERBERGER: I can’t. I can’t help you anymore. I’m sorry.\nHINTERBERGER: DOCTOR WATCHES HIM GO.\nDOCTOR: Wait! (BEAT, THEN, SADLY) Come back.\nKLEIN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: About time.\nWILL: Where’s Hinterberger off to?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea. Nor, I suspect, does he.\nKLEIN: What happened?\nDOCTOR: He just ran away.\nKLEIN: What did you say to him?\nDOCTOR: Nothing. He told me he was afraid.\nKLEIN: We have to go after him.\nDOCTOR: Page 66 of 129\nDOCTOR: I’m getting too old for running. Mr Arrowsmith can go.\nWILL: Really? I’m afraid I’m not much of a sprinter.\nDOCTOR: I think you underestimate yourself.\nKLEIN: Go on then, Will! Get after him and bring him back.\nWILL: Are you sure? I mean, you’ve not got a motorbike in the TARDIS\nWILL: or anything like that?\nDOCTOR: Run.\nWILL: What if he won’t come back?\nDOCTOR: Then persuade him.\nKLEIN: Will? Run!\nWILL: OK! OK! I’1ll give it a go.\nWILL: HINTERBERGER.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 67 of 129\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING AFTER WILL) There’s a taverna by the beach! Bring Herr Hinterberger there!\nKLEIN: How do you know there’s a taverna by the beach, if you’ve not been here before?\nDOCTOR: There’s bound to be a taverna by the beach. We’1l need somewhere to talk. Somewhere quiet, somewhere we won’t be disturbed.\nKLEIN: Is that so? And what will we be talking about?\nDOCTOR: Kurt Schalk. And all that he means for the future of this planet.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 68 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38. EXT. BEACH\nCASTA: Kurt? Are you all right?\nSCHALK: Forgive me, Casta, darling. A momentary lapse.\nCASTA: You’re not looking after yourself, are you? Living alone out here.\nSCHALK: You might be surprised. I am nothing if not resourceful.\nCASTA: What were you talking about then, anyway? The creatures from beyond?\nSCHALK: Pay no attention. It was only... verbiage. Night-stuff. Chatter.\nCASTA: But where did this night-stuff come from?\nSCHALK: From my dreams, my darling. My strange and terrible dreams.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 69 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39. EXT. SCRUBLAND\nDOCTOR WHO: EXHAUSTED AND OUT OF BREATH.\nWILL: Herr Hinterberger! Lukas! Wait! There’s nowhere to run!

DUSTY ROAD\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND KLEIN WALKING.\nDOCTOR: You seem disgruntled, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: Merely impatient.\nDOCTOR: Impatient?\nKLEIN: For the truth.\nDOCTOR: That’s understandable.\nKLEIN: And it’s time now for the truth, Doctor. Isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I first heard the name Kurt Schalk two months ago, on those interstellar communications I monitor from my TARDIS.\nKLEIN: What communications? What do you monitor?\nDOCTOR: I have numerous lines of enquiry.\nKLEIN: Be specific.\nDOCTOR: Across thousands of worlds... the wireless communications of a multitude of law enforcement organisations. The private correspondence of a plethora of governments. The memos and e- mails of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings. Those secret words that fly daily to and fro in the criminal underworlds of hundreds of occupied planets.\nKLEIN: Your TARDIS can do all that?\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t part of her original design. But I’ve managed to persuade her.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 71 of 129\nKLEIN: Good grief. And Schalk?\nDOCTOR: It was only a rumour at first. Only a whisper. But then I started to hear the name more regularly. Then over and over. Somehow Kurt Schalk of Earth in the year 1945 has become the most wanted man in the known universe.\nKLEIN: Who’s searching for him?\nDOCTOR: Who isn’t? Gangsters, warmongers, intergalactic powers. Dictators, barbarians, tyrannical regimes. Peacemakers, bounty- hunters, old enemies and new friends. Every spacefaring race which comes within the purview of the TARDIS’ scanners is looking for Kurt Schalk.\nKLEIN: But why?\nDOCTOR: Ah, now isn’t that the million-dollar question?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 72 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. EXT. BEACH\nSCHALK: You remember the night that we spent together, Casta? When your brothers were away? And the air was filled with song?\nCASTA: Yes. I’m only surprised you do. Please, let’s go to the village.\nSCHALK: I woke that night — do you remember? — shortly before dawn. I woke screaming and afraid.\nCASTA: I’d assumed that was the wine from the night before.\nSCHALK: It was a nightmare. Such as I have suffered every night almost Since the beginning of the war.\nCASTA: Every night?\nSCHALK: Every night.\nCASTA: Then you should probably eat less cheese.\nSCHALK: You mock me. But there is fear in your mockery. You know what my nightmares have done to me.\nCASTA: I suppose I have some idea.\nSCHALK: My dreams... aren’t really dreams, you see.\nCASTA: No? Then what are they?\nSCHALK: Messages. Instructions. From a higher power.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 73 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. EXT. DUSTY ROAD\nKLEIN: There has to be a very good reason why so many people should want this... Schalk.\nDOCTOR: There must. But I don’t know what it is.\nKLEIN: You’re sure? You’re not keeping anything back? You’re told me everything you know?\nDOCTOR: Well... I have heard rumours. Tittle-tattle. Gossip.\nKLEIN: And?\nDOCTOR: I don’t want to believe a word of it.\nKLEIN: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because if even half of it is true — even a tenth — then every life-form in the universe is in the most terrible danger.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 74 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. EXT. BEACH\nCASTA: Poor Kurt.\nSCHALK: You don’t believe me? You think I’m mad?\nCASTA: No. No, I don’t. Not here. Not on Minos. Isn’t this the land of the gods, after all? Where Zeus appeared to Leda as a swan and to the mother of Perseus as a torrent of gold?\nSCHALK: I love it when you tell me the old stories.\nCASTA: Thank you.\nSCHALK: So why can’t you love me back? Please. At least... at least let me steal a kiss.\nSCHALK: AND HE LEANS IN HUNGRILY FOR A KISS...\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 75 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. EXT. DUSTY ROAD\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND KLEIN WALKING AGAIN.\nDOCTOR: It’s very peaceful here, don’t you think? The sun-baked earth... the olive groves... the sound of the sea... Hard to believe that until recently it was a distant outpost of the Reich. (BEAT) Elizabeth? You’re being very quiet.\nKLEIN: I’ve been thinking, Doctor. About what you said. And I’m shocked.\nDOCTOR: I’ve told you all I can. For now.\nKLEIN: No, I’m not surprised by this... intergalactic manhunt. The Khlecht. The Spivelyn. The hundred other interested parties.\nDOCTOR: No?\nKLEIN: I’m shocked by you.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nKLEIN: That you’d stoop to eavesdropping. Isn’t that what it is? Really? Eavesdropping on a massive scale? Listening in... looking for trouble.\nDOCTOR: You said it yourself. We both have to know.\nKLEIN: But this is more than that. More than curiosity. This is... obsessive. And it’s not how you used to operate. Why? Why now?\nDOCTOR: Because, like Herr Hinterberger, I’m afraid.\nKLEIN: Tell me.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 76 of 129\nDOCTOR: I’m close to the end, Elizabeth. In this body, at least. And I’m afraid that whatever new man comes after me won’t be strong enough to do what I do. That he won’t be willing to go as far as I have gone.\nKLEIN: So you’re doing everything you can now to seek out the enemy? You’re looking for evil and shutting it down? While you still have the mettle to do it?\nDOCTOR: Just so.\nKLEIN: Then... I do... I think I understand.\nDOCTOR: I thought you might. Out of all of them, I thought it’d be you who understood.\nKLEIN: So that’s why you came looking for me? Because I’m the perfect companion for who you’ve become?\nDOCTOR: (MOCK-INNOCENT) Oh no. All that was pure coincidence.\nKLEIN: Doctor...\nKLEIN: IN THE DISTANCE WE HEAR A MAN (SCHALK) SCREAM.\nDOCTOR: Aha.\nKLEIN: Who was that?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea. Shall we find out?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 77 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45. EXT. OLIVE GROVE\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH HINTERBERGER. BOTH ARE EXHAUSTED AND OUT OF BREATH.\nWILL: Lukas! Lukas! Give it up!\nWILL: HINTERBERGER STUMBLES TO A STOP. WILL DOES THE SAME.\nHINTERBERGER: Oh, very well. I am out of condition and you... you are indefatigable, Herr Arrowsmith.\nWILL: Really? No-one’s ever said that about me before.\nHINTERBERGER: No?\nWILL: You seem... a bit better now.\nHINTERBERGER: I have run the madness out of me.\nWILL: What happened? Why did you run away?\nHINTERBERGER: I suppose I felt... a tidal wave of fear. I was submerged in it. I lost all reason.\nWILL: But you seemed calm enough before.\nHINTERBERGER: I cannot say for certain. It was arriving here, I think. The journey. The sight of that box. I.. I think I had seen it before and I knew it as an omen of something terrible...\nWILL: Where had you seen it before?\nHINTERBERGER: It is uncertain... confused in my mind. Have you never suffered from.. bad dreams, Herr Arrowsmith?\nWILL: Doesn’t everyone? Now and then?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 78 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: AS WILL TALKS, IN THE DISTANCE, THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS BEGIN TO APPROACH, FLOATING SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE GROUND.\nHINTERBERGER: Stop. Stop talking.\nWILL: Oh. Sorry.\nHINTERBERGER: Do you see them?\nWILL: Who?\nHINTERBERGER: Turn around.\nHINTERBERGER: WILL TURNS AROUND.\nWILL: Oh! Yes, I see them. (FX: FUMBLING FOR DICTAPHONE) I should make a record of this... (FX: CLICKS DICTAPHONE ON) Arrowsmith here, on Minos. I’m with Herr Hinterberger, the Nazi, and two... beings are approaching. (MORE TO HINTERBERGER) Is that a trick of the light, do you think, or are they actually floating above the ground?\nHINTERBERGER: (TERRIFIED) They have followed us here. They are coming for us!\nWILL: They do seem to be moving this way, yes. Who — what are they?\nHINTERBERGER: Struwwelpeter! Struwwelpeter! The Struwwelpeter are here!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 79 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. EXT. BEACH\nDOCTOR WHO: KURT SCHALK IS LYING ON THE SAND, WHIMPERING SLIGHTLY. CASTA STANDS OVER HIM. SHE HAS JUST KICKED HIM.\nSCHALK: Please, my love. Won’t you help me up?\nCASTA: You don’t deserve my help.\nSCHALK: It was a temporary madness only. I shouldn’t have asked for a kiss. Please, I’m in some considerable pain.\nCASTA: I don’t believe I kicked you that hard.\nSCHALK: You don’t know your own strength. Have some compassion.\nDOCTOR: Hello there! I do hope we’re intruding. I’m the Doctor and this is my friend, Elizabeth Klein.\nCASTA: What do you want?\nKLEIN: We heard a scream.\nCASTA: That was him. He says I kicked him too hard.\nDOCTOR: And why would you want to do that?\nCASTA: He tried to kiss me. When I’d asked him not to.\nKLEIN: Then I’d say he’s lucky not to have suffered considerably more.\nDOCTOR: Klein...\nCASTA: He says he loves me. But he has proved a disappointment.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 80 of 129\nKLEIN: That’s often the way, I’ve found.\nSCHALK: Please... help me up.\nCASTA: I’m Casta.\nKLEIN: Pleased to meet you, Casta.\nCASTA: And the man on the ground making a fuss about nothing is Kurt Schalk.\nKLEIN: Well, well.\nDOCTOR: Hello, Kurt. (BEAT) I’ve been looking for you.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 81 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. EXT. OLIVE GROVE\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL AND HINTERBERGER HAVE PASSED OUT ON THE GROUND. THEY ARE ALONE.\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL IS THE FIRST TO AWAKEN — WITH A CONVULSIVE START.\nWILL: Aah! (LOOKS AROUND) Oh. Oh. What’s... (HE TURNS TO HINTERBERGER) Hinterberger.. Lukas, wake up.\nWILL: WILL SHAKES HINTERBERGER AWAKE.\nHINTERBERGER: What... What happened?\nWILL: We’ve been unconscious. Must’ve been out for... (HE CONSULTS HIS WATCH)... five minutes.\nHINTERBERGER: This happens sometimes in their presence. The human form is able to withstand only occasional contact with them.\nWILL: With who?\nHINTERBERGER: Do you not remember?\nWILL: Just glimpses... Flashes in my mind... Like remembering a nightmare when you wake.\nHINTERBERGER: Indeed. Just so.\nWILL: Who were they? What did they want?\nHINTERBERGER: The Struwwelpeter. And their motives are inscrutable.\nWILL: Did they speak to us? I seem to have some memory of them saying something.\nHINTERBERGER: As do I. But our minds would have wiped the memory for the sake of our sanity.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 82 of 129\nWILL: Wiped it? Hang on a moment.\nWILL: HE SEES THAT IT HAS BEEN RECORDING AND SWITCHES IT OFF.\nHINTERBERGER: What is that?\nWILL: It’s called a Dictaphone. After your time. Now, you’re not going to believe this. It’s quite improbable.\nHINTERBERGER: If it has to do with the Struwwelpeter then I should believe anything. They are made of some different substance to us. Improbability is their greatest ally.\nWILL: You see, if I were me, and I am, the first thing I’d do if I saw these Struwwelpeter approaching is record my impressions of them on this device. And since the tape was still running just now, I think I did.\nHINTERBERGER: But why would you have done that?\nWILL: It’s a compulsion, I suppose. The point is, that if these Struwwelpeter spoke to us — well, I’d have recorded whatever it was they said.\nHINTERBERGER: We can hear them?\nWILL: We can.\nHINTERBERGER: Dare we?\nWILL: I dare.\nPLAY. WE HEAR THE RECORDING: FROM SCENE 45:\nWILL: (ON TAPE) ~{fhey-do-seem tobe} moving this way, yes. Who — what\nWILL: are they?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 83 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: (ON TAPE) Struwwelpeter! Struwwelpeter! The Struwwelpeter are here!\nHINTERBERGER: THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS SOUND PLAINTIVE AND DESPERATE.\nSHEPHERD: (ON TAPE) Where is the thing we seek?\nSHEPHERDESS: (ON TAPE) Thou must speak true.\nSHEPHERD: (ON TAPE) Tell us.\nSHEPHERDESS: (ON TAPE) Where is our Persuasion Machine?\nSHEPHERDESS: WILL PAUSES THE RECORDING.\nWILL: Now, what the devil is a “Persuasion Machine”?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 84 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. EXT. BEACH\nDOCTOR WHO: SCHALK IS ON HIS FEET NOW, WITH HIS HANDS IN THE AIR.\nSCHALK: You have my unconditional surrender, Doctor. Let us see if we might not work together.\nDOCTOR: I don’t want your surrender.\nSCHALK: No. I have been talking with my Casta. I have decided that I am now ready to defect. Please. Take me to British High Command. In exchange for a full pardon and British citizenship I shall tell you everything I know.\nDOCTOR: I’m not from British High Command.\nSCHALK: You sound British.\nCASTA: Are you... American?\nDOCTOR: I am not of this Earth.\nCASTA: But you look human. Completely human.\nKLEIN: Don’t be fooled.\nSCHALK: Then you’re one... of the others?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That’s right. I’m one of the others.\nKLEIN: But don’t worry. We’re not here to hurt you. Are we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No. We’re here to ask you why.\nCASTA: Why?\nSCHALK: Yes. Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 85 of 129\nDOCTOR: Why the best and worst of all the galaxies are trying to track you down.\nSCHALK: I see.\nDOCTOR: You don’t seem surprised.\nSCHALK: I am not surprised. I know what it is they are looking for.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And what is that?\nSCHALK: They are looking for the Persuasion Machine.\nKLEIN: The what?\nSCHALK: Can you protect me? From the others?\nDOCTOR: I can take you to a place of safety. I can keep you out of Sight.\nSCHALK: You give me your word? You won’t throw me to the wolves?\nDOCTOR: You have my word as a gentleman.\nSCHALK: Then I will tell you everything. About the dreams. About the Persuasion Machine. About the desires of the Struwwelpeter. But I will do it over a drink. It is a long, strange story and I’ve grown thirsty again.\nCASTA: There is a taverna on the coast road. Shall we go there?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE, TO KLEIN) Of course there is.\nSCHALK: (TO CASTA) Yes. Yes, very well. I think I’m ready now. Lead on, my darling.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 86 of 129\nCASTA: (BEAT) Are you talking to me?\nSCHALK: Of course. No one else is my darling here. And you know how I want you so.\nCASTA: How many more bones would you like broken?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Please, Casta. I’d be very grateful if you could show us the way.\nCASTA: Fine. Follow me.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. We’re most grateful.\nDOCTOR: THE FOUR OF THEM SET OFF, WALKING UP THE BEACH AND TOWARDS THE VILLAGE.\nKLEIN: I admire your restraint, Casta. I think I'd have sent him packing ages ago.\nCASTA: I have known him for less than a month. I had not meant to see him again. But then... this morning... something made me come back.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 87 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. EXT. OLIVE GROVE\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL AND HINTERBERGER ARE PLAYING BACK THE RECORDING, HEARD IN SCENE 47:\nSHEPHERD: Where is the thing we seek?\nSHEPHERDESS: Thou must speak true.\nSHEPHERD: Tell us.\nSHEPHERDESS: Where is our Persuasion Machine?\nWILL: Ow.\nHINTERBERGER: What is it?\nWILL: My Dictaphone is... ow!.. getting hot.\nHINTERBERGER: Drop it! Will, drop it now!\nHINTERBERGER: IT BURSTS INTO FLAME AND IS CONSUMED BY FIRE.\nWILL: Gosh. An undeniable case of spontaneous combustion. (BEAT) Did you know that was going to happen?\nHINTERBERGER: I have seen similar things before.\nWILL: With the Struwwelpeter?\nHINTERBERGER: Yes.\nWILL: Any idea why?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 88 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: Kurt had many theories. Neither he nor I have ever been religious men. And yet the Struwwelpeter.. are — or rather have been — almost indistinguishable from gods. The devices and mediums of Man are too weak to hold even the slightest trace of them.\nWILL: We should tell the Doctor and Klein what’s happened. Events are getting ahead of us. When I went after you he said we’d find them at the taverna. Do you know where that is?\nHINTERBERGER: I think I can find it.\nWILL: Really? That’s good. But you’ve never been here before?\nHINTERBERGER: I’ve seen maps, I think.\nWILL: Are you quite recovered?\nHINTERBERGER: Completely. My madness has passed.\nWILL: Jolly glad to hear it.\nHINTERBERGER: And you are right. We need to find the Doctor and Klein, track down Kurt and get ourselves away from this island before...\nWILL: Before what?\nHINTERBERGER: Before the Struwwelpeter come for us again.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 89 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. EXT. OUTSIDE THE TAVERNA\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTOR AND SCHALK LAG SLIGHTLY BEHIND THEM.\nKLEIN: Is this it?\nCASTA: You don’t like it?\nKLEIN: It’s quite... rustic.\nCASTA: You mean ancient, run-down and dilapidated?\nKLEIN: I wouldn’t put it in quite those terms.\nCASTA: This is how we like it here. We have had enough of modernity on Minos, thank you. We prefer the old ways.\nKLEIN: Forgive me. I meant no offence.\nCASTA: And none has been taken. You are from somewhere very different, I think.\nKLEIN: How perceptive of you.\nCASTA: Thank you. Shall we go in?\nSCHALK: Wait.\nCASTA: What is it now?\nSCHALK: Don’t you sense it?\nCASTA: Sense what?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 90 of 129\nDOCTOR: Herr Schalk is right.\nCASTA: He is?\nDOCTOR: His senses seem... attuned.\nKLEIN: Doctor? What is it?\nDOCTOR: Listen. (BEAT) We’re standing outside a taverna just months after this island has been liberated. Shouldn’t there be noise from inside? Shouldn’t there be laughter? Conversation? Clinking glass and celebration? Not this... stifling silence.\nDOCTOR: SHOUTS OUT A GREETING.\nWILL: (SHOUTS) Doctor! Dr Klein! Look who I bumped into!\nKLEIN: Oh, for goodness’ sake. You were saying, Doctor?\nSCHALK: Lukas?\nCASTA: You know this man?\nSCHALK: Not the pale one. The one with him.\nCASTA: A friend of yours, is he? A German friend?\nSCHALK: His name is Lukas Hinterberger. He was one of my assistants. He\nSCHALK: is an honourable man.\nCASTA: Oh yes. You were all “honourable men”.\nWILL: Hello everyone.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 91 of 129\nHINTERBERGER: Hello Doctor. Hello Dr Klein.\nKLEIN: Herr Hinterberger.\nHINTERBERGER: And hello... Kurt.\nSCHALK: Hello, old friend.\nWILL: (TO CASTA) And hello to you too. I don’t believe we’ve met. My name’s Will Arrowsmith.\nCASTA: I am Casta. You are English?\nWILL: Yes.\nCASTA: Welcome to Minos.\nWILL: Thanks. It seems very nice so far.\nDOCTOR: Can I have your attention please?\nDOCTOR: EVERYONE FALLS SILENT.\nDOCTOR: That’s better. Now, before Mr Arrowsmith and Herr Hinterberger arrived, we were endeavouring to listen to the silence.\nWILL: Oh. Were you?\nKLEIN: The Doctor thinks something's... out of kilter here.\nDOCTOR: It’s the same silence we heard in Diisseldorf. It is the silence of the dark corners of the universe. The silence of the space between things.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 92 of 129\nCASTA: You think too much, Doctor. The taverna is silent only because it has yet to open. Thankfully, I know the owner and there should be no trouble in persuading him to open just a little early. You are all guests on this island and I wish to show you just how hospitable we can be. Everyone, please, come with me.\nCASTA: PUSHES OPEN THE DOOR AND WALKS INSIDE.\nKLEIN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I.. I don’t... Perhaps she’s right.\nDOCTOR: CASTA CALLS OUT FROM INSIDE THE TAVERNA.\nCASTA: (FROM INSIDE) Come in! Everyone! It’s all fine. Christos is just opening up.\nKLEIN: Come along then everyone.\nHINTERBERGER: A drink would be most welcome.\nWILL: Doctor? Are you sure it’s safe?\nDOCTOR: If there’s one thing you need to know about me, Mr Arrowsmith, it’s this: if I ever seem sure then I’m never as sure as I seem. Shall we go inside?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 93 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. INT. TAVERNA [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR WHO: CASTA IS WAITING FOR THEM, FLANKED BY THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS.\nDOCTOR: Hello! A jug of ice-water and a box of loukoumi, pl— [ease.] (STOPS SHORT) Ah.\nSHEPHERD: Welcome, O Doctor.\nSHEPHERDESS: Welcome, gentle Lord.\nCASTA: I’m sorry, Doctor. But this is by far the best way.\nKLEIN: Casta, I have to say I’m disappointed.\nCASTA: They arrived this morning... in pursuit, they said, of something... lost. They were so radiant. So wise. Forgive me, I had no choice but to obey.\nSHEPHERD: And welcome to you all, our noble slaves.\nSHEPHERDESS: E’en you, poor Schalk, come back to us at last.\nSCHALK: Casta? My darling?\nCASTA: It’s what you deserve, Kurt. Deep down I think you know it.\nDOCTOR: (TO SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS) Fascinating. What are you?\nHINTERBERGER: Struwwelpeter! Struwwelpeter!\nWILL: Yes. It certainly looks like that.\nDOCTOR: You’re not of this Earth, are you? Where are you from? What do you want?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 94 of\nSHEPHERD: Oh, thou doth speak the truth, sagacious thing.\nSHEPHERDESS: We have come hence from some far greater plane.\nDOCTOR: And I can see our reality doesn’t agree with you. “Just look at him! there he stands,\nDOCTOR: With his nasty hair and [hands. -]”\nSHEPHERDESS: Now hold thy tongue lest we should pluck it out.\nSHEPHERD: Yet thou speak true. In this foul universe We have diminished been and made corrupt.\nSHEPHERDESS: Alas, but we have found that to restore\nSHEPHERDESS: Our ruined selves on new life must we feed.\nDOCTOR: 129\nDOCTOR: I wondered when you were going to say something like that. For\nDOCTOR: all your fine words.\nSHEPHERDESS: Sad little Schalk? Of you we still have need. And Doctor? You intrigue us so shall live. The rest, I fear, you will be eaten up.\nSHEPHERD: But know this, little savages. We are\nSHEPHERD: Cast down, appalled, distraught by what we do. I wish you all to know how grave we are.\nSHEPHERDESS: And yet we must survive. We must go on. So you, poor girl, come here unto your gods.\nCASTA: Yes, my mistress. Yes, my noble lord.\nKLEIN: Casta! Casta, no!\nCASTA: I am your vassal. You are my gods. This is the proper way things.\nSCHALK: Casta? My darling-? Do you know these creatures-?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 95 of 129\nKLEIN: Casta! Don’t let them touch you. Casta!\nKLEIN: COMPLIANT CASTA, DRAINING HER OF HER LIFE ENERGY.\nSHEPHERD: Yet as you die, I pray you understand.\nSHEPHERDESS: And know how grateful are we for thy life.\nDOCTOR: She was your servant. She’d done everything you’d asked. You didn’t have to do that.\nSHEPHERD: But there was nothing joyous in the act.\nSHEPHERDESS: No choice had we if we are to endure.\nDOCTOR: I can see it wasn’t the first time. The floor is thick with dust and ashes.\nKLEIN: (SICKENED REALISATION) Just... just as it was in Diisseldorf.\nDOCTOR: How many others have there been? How many villages? How many towns?\nSHEPHERD: You have our pledge that we regret these crimes.\nSHEPHERDESS: Yet all we do is for the greater good.\nDOCTOR: And I suppose you’re still hungry? You both look ravenous.\nSHEPHERD: Oh, little man, I fear thou speak the truth.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 96 of 129\nSHEPHERDESS: So! Who of you would first give us delight And serve yourselves to sate our appetite?\nSHEPHERDESS: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 97 of 129"

A sad and ruined thing. All here is degradation, blood and death.\nSHEPHERDESS: A billion worlds we’ve seen more fair than this.\nDOCTOR: A billion? Then you’re even older than I thought.\nSCHALK: Oh, they are more ancient than you can imagine.\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find I have a vivid imagination, Herr Schalk. Besides, my point still stands. You’ve not seen the best of this universe. You’ve not even seen the best of this planet, plucky little mudball that she is.\nKLEIN: No need to patronise us, Doctor.\nSHEPHERD: You say that there is more that we might see? Harmonious and kinder than this place?\nDOCTOR: Many, many worlds of great beauty. One in particular.\nSHEPHERD: Your words intrigue us.\nSHEPHERDESS: They do give us hope.\nDOCTOR: Good! Excellent! So why don’t I show you... the most beautiful planet I know?\nSHEPHERDESS: And where is to be found this world of yours?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 99 of 129\nDOCTOR: Not far. A couple of galaxies away, towards the constellation of Kasterborous. It’s a planet called New Peerlessness. And as far as I’m concerned it’s a little paradise. It certainly knocks the Eye of Orion into a cocked hat.\nSHEPHERD: But how will it appear to us who have Such great perfection known and shepherded?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. But neither will you till you see it. I hope you'll like it enough to take a different view on all this. And once you seen what’s possible on New Peerlessness, you’ll be able to understand what’s possible everywhere.\nSHEPHERDESS: We thank you for your words. But we must feed.\nDOCTOR: There’s food aplenty on New Peerlessness. Though strictly of the vegetable kind. And the place has certain healing properties. You’1ll not suffer as you’ve suffered here.\nKLEIN: Doctor? Are you offering these creatures an amnesty? When we watched them kill poor Casta?\nDOCTOR: I’m doing what I have to do. I thought you of all people would understand that.\nSCHALK: The Struwwelpeter are not renowned for their mercy.\nWILL: But people can change, Herr Schalk.\nSHEPHERD: Now we have heard your words this is our choice: We will this blissful place of yours observe.\nSHEPHERDESS: Our minds are open.

This is Bondsman Tango-Veldt. How may I serve you today?\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) Report.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT:\nACQUISITOR PRIME: The Time Lord known as the Doctor has failed to detect the presence of our craft when cloaked. According to the scan engine, he has just departed the planet Earth. Destination: unknown.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) I don’t care when he’s going, Bondsman. What I care about is that the plans for the Persuasion Machine are now unguarded. Find them. Bring them home.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: Yes, most belligerent and unstinting Acquisitor.

Would you like a glass?\nKLEIN: No, I most assuredly would not. Besides, aren’t you upset? The girl you said you loved has just been killed in front of you.\nSCHALK: I never said I loved her. I said I wanted her. Two quite different things.\nKLEIN: You really are a piece of work. No wonder half the galaxy’s out looking for you. They’re probably forming an orderly queue to punch you hard on the nose.\nSCHALK: We all have different ways of grieving, Dr Klein. Please do not judge me.\nKLEIN: If I can’t judge you, Schalk, who can I judge?\nSCHALK: Lukas?\nHINTERBERGER: Thank you.

You are being addressed by Spivelyn Bondsman Tango-Veldt, Emissary of the Quenchless Spivelyn Empire. We want the Persuasion Machine. You are to give yourself up at once and yield to our tractor beam.\nHINTERBERGER: Klein? What do we do?\nSCHALK: I suppose I could give myself up. Strike a deal. Work with them. You know me. I’d find a way of coming out on top.\nKLEIN: Not while I’m here, you won’t. Come on. The ship’s at the front. We can leave through the back door.\nSCHALK: And then what?\nKLEIN: And then, Herr Schalk — we run!\nKLEIN: 129\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 106 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM (STATIC)\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) So the Doctor’s given me a new Dictaphone. He called it a Sonic Dictaphone, no doubt as a kind of joke, though as I pointed out to him a Dictaphone must, by its very nature be Sonic, that word being derived from the Latin root “sonus”, meaning, literally, “sound”. Sorry. Must be nerves. So. This is how things are. We weren’t in flight for long. I stayed in the shadows and didn’t speak to anyone, but the Doctor seemed to be able to keep up a conversation with those eerie creatures. We landed a short while ago on the planet New Peerlessness. The Doctor and the others are out there now. I was told, in no uncertain terms to stay put. I can see them on the scanner. And the Doctor was right. New Peerlessness is very beautiful.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 107 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. EXT. GREEN FIELDS OF NEW PEERLESSNESS\nDOCTOR WHO: ROLLING HILLS. SUNSHINE. THE DROWSY HUM OF BEES. CHEERFUL BIRDSONG. ALL IS BEAUTY AND TRANQUILLITY.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTOR, THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS ARE WALKING THROUGH THE LONG GRASS.\nDOCTOR: So. What thinkest thou of this fair m- [eadow?] (STOPS HIMSELF) Sorry — it’s catching. I mean — what do you think of this planet?\nSHEPHERDESS: You spoke some truth. This place is beauteous.\nSHEPHERD: In pastures, gentle hills and golden light It doth in aspect seem so much like home.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad. I told you there was more to this rackety old universe than met the eye. You really mustn’t judge a place by the first of its people you meet, you know.\nSHEPHERDESS: And is the planet all as it is here? Is all as green and beautiful and sweet?\nDOCTOR: The whole planet. A beacon of what’s possible even in this universe. Do you feel better now?\nSHEPHERDESS: Oh yes. And e’en our hunger hath withdrawn. Our looks have grown more gentle than before.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’re not so “Struwwelpeter” now, are you?\nSHEPHERD: Our minds are also changed. I fear they had So clouded grown that we did many deeds\nSHEPHERD: Of which we now should greatly be ashamed.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad you’re feeling better. You know, I think there’s a lot we could learn from one another. I’ve so many questions to ask you.. And there’s a lot I could teach you. We could work together to make this universe better.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 108 of 129\nSHEPHERD: In your words there’s hope. I feel sure That there is much we three might yet achieve.\nDOCTOR: I know. (DARKER) And that’s why I’m so sorry about what I have to do now.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 109 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM (STATIC)\nWILL: (TO DICTAPHONE) It seems to be going well. They’re chatting away quite amicably.\nDOCTOR: Things are not as they appear to be, Mr Arrowsmith.\nWILL: Doctor? But you’re.. out there.\nWILL: SWITCHES.\nWILL: What’s happening? Doctor? What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) Dematerialising.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 110 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59. EXT. GREEN FIELDS OF NEW PEERLESSNESS [CONTINUOUS]\nSHEPHERDESS: And now the Ship of space and time hath gone!\nDOCTOR: I admit I’m surprised this has fooled you. If I’d encountered you at the height of your powers I don’t imagine it would have done.\nSHEPHERDESS: Pray, Doctor, do not toy with us for sport. We thought you ally, hope and even friend.\nSHEPHERD: Explain yourself at once. Thou must speak true.\nDOCTOR: You’re too dangerous to be let loose in my universe. Your intentions might be good but you’re too powerful and too strong. You will harm the creatures who live here even if you don’t mean to.\nSHEPHERD: We wish to help.\nSHEPHERDESS: We want to make things right.\nDOCTOR: You killed a girl called Casta. And goodness knows how many others. You drove Schalk and Hinterberger mad. You’ve done more harm than good.\nSHEPHERD: There was no choice. And all these worlds will yet Give us such gratitude and praise.\nSHEPHERDESS: Besides What price the individual life when set ‘Gainst all the moral bounty we will bring?\nDOCTOR: Your question betrays you.\nSHEPHERD: Didst we not tell thee as we travelled here Of our Persuasion dream and all its works?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 111 of 129\nDOCTOR: Your Persuasion Machine, like you, is too dangerous. I can’t tolerate beings who put the greater good before the lives of individuals. I’m sorry, but New Peerlessness is a prison planet. It was built long ago by my people. Cocooned in impermeable force fields. It let me in because it knows me.\nSHEPHERD: So thou wouldst trap us here? And have us starve?\nDOCTOR: There’s vegetation and water. But I’m afraid you won’t live for long. The healing properties of this place are only temporary. You won’t feel it. I’ve spared you that. But the corruption that’s inside you has not been halted, only masked. You have only a short time left in which, I hope, you’1ll find some measure of peace.\nSHEPHERDESS: Thou art a most perfidious, traitorous knave. But thou is also traitor to thyself\nSHEPHERDESS: For thou art surely trapped here with us both.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. You see, I’m not really here at all. This isn’t the real me. Just a telepathic hologram. Farewell.\nDOCTOR: OUT OF EXISTENCE.\nDOCTOR: THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS ARE LEFT ALONE. THE SHEPHERDESS SCREAMS IN UNEARTHLY RAGE.\nSHEPHERD: Oh, my sweet love. You seem convulsed by rage.\nSHEPHERDESS: How could I not when Eden is a cage?\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 112 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. INT. COCKPIT OF SPIVELYN SCOUTSHIP\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) This is Acquisitor Prime of the Spivelyn Empire.

He is now in flight with certain others and I am in pursuit. They seem to be heading towards a densely wooded area.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) Track them! Bring me Kurt Schalk! Do not be polite, Bondsman. Do not merely urge Schalk’s surrender. Force him to yield. We are not mewling pups but Spivelyn! Spivelyn, Lords of the Galactic Index! Spivelyn, Ravagers of the Interstellar Exchange! Spivelyn!

WOODS OF MINOS\nDOCTOR WHO: TO A HALT BENEATH THE TREES.\nSCHALK: (BREATHLESS) I’m sorry... we're going to have to stop.\nHINTERBERGER: (DITTO) Yes. Me also.\nKLEIN: You two are out of shape. You need to get some exercise.\nHINTERBERGER: Forgive us our lack of athleticism, Fraulein. It may have escaped your notice but we have had a busy few years.\nKLEIN: We’re probably safe enough here. For a few minutes at least. The trees should mask us from the sky.\nSCHALK: Thank you, Fraulein.\nKLEIN: While you get your breath back, gentlemen, and since we may not get another chance, you can answer some questions.\nHINTERBERGER: Well. Secrecy seems irrelevant now. What do you wish to know?\nKLEIN: Tell me about those “busy years”, gentlemen.\nSCHALK: You wish to know the whole story? Right from the start?\nKLEIN: Yes.\nSCHALK: I was not always as you see me now. Before the war, I was somebody quite different.\nKLEIN: Spit it out.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 114 of 129\nSCHALK: Once I was just an ordinary clerk in an ordinary office in Berlin. I was — I can admit it — entirely unremarkable in every way. My only talent was for obscurity. I was able to lose myself with ease amongst the crowd. That, I think, is why they chose me. And that is why they sent the dreams.\nKLEIN: Tell me about those dreams, Herr Schalk.\nSCHALK: The dreams showed me many impossible things. Other worlds, realities, dimensions. For the first month I thought I must be going mad.\nHINTERBERGER: He did. He confided to me that he thought he had lost his mind.\nKLEIN: But they were sent, weren’t they? The dreams were sent by those creatures? Why? What did they want?\nSCHALK: They had chosen me, Dr Klein. To carry out a mission.\nKLEIN: And what was that?\nSCHALK: To build them a Machine.\nKLEIN: The Persuasion Machine?\nHINTERBERGER: The Persuasion Machine!\nKLEIN: And what exactly was that supposed to do?\nSCHALK: The clue lies in the name, Dr Klein. It was going to be very good at... persuading people.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 115 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM (IN FLIGHT)\nDOCTOR WHO: THOUGHT.\nWILL: You tricked them? With a “telepathic hologram”?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. Those poor creatures.\nWILL: I’d no idea such a thing was even possible.\nDOCTOR: It’s not. Not for you. It needs a Time Lord mind.\nWILL: So they’re trapped there, are they? For good?\nDOCTOR: One can never be certain. Even the gaol of the most ancient of my people may not be enough to hold them. Were they not in this weakened state it would most assuredly be insufficient. As it is, the prison needs one further fence.\nWILL: What are you doing? (BEAT) Doctor? (BEAT) Whatever it is.. the TARDIS doesn’t seem to like it.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 116 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63. EXT. WOODS OF MINOS\nKLEIN: A machine that’s capable of persuading anyone in its sphere of influence to believe in anything? Any point of view? Any belief system or ideology? I see now why you’ve suddenly found yourself so sought after. But what did those creatures want you to do with it?\nSCHALK: They wanted to restore their universe. To make this world into a paradise. But they knew humanity would always ruin what was perfect. This was why they needed the Machine. To turn on all of us. To make us all agree with them. They had in mind a network of such machines on Earth. And after Earth... on every inhabited planet in the universe.\nKLEIN: One point of view. One consensus. You never built it, surely?\nSCHALK: A... prototype only.\nKLEIN: And did it work?\nKLEIN: THE TWO MEN SEEM TO HESITATE SLIGHTLY.\nHINTERBERGER: We do not know. We never tried to use it.\nKLEIN: Why not? What stopped you? With a device like that... you could have won the war.\nSCHALK: I think... we both went a little crazy, Dr Klein.\nHINTERBERGER: The technology was not meant for human brains. We abandoned our research. We fled.\nSCHALK: But I still have knowledge of the Machine. I spared Lukas from most of it. He never knew all the details. But I — I could still build the Persuasion Machine if I had to. The blueprint... it’s up here.

You can be assured of this — I may leave as their prisoner but I will return at their head.\nKLEIN: Wait. Look at the ship. It’s... stopped rotating. Something’s wrong.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 121 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69. INT. COCKPIT OF SPIVELYN SCOUTSHIP\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) Why do you delay, Bondsman?\nACQUISITOR PRIME: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: Forgive me, Acquisitor. But something is wrong with the system. The whole thing’s completely frozen.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: (D) Then get the tech boys onto it. Now!\nACQUISITOR PRIME: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: No need, sir. I think I can see the problem. It’s... dammit, Acquisitor.. it’s some sort of message from outside our network.\nACQUISITOR PRIME: THEN, FROM EVERY SPEAKER ON THE SPIVELYN SHIP, WE HEAR A FAMILIAR SOUND...\nKHLECHT VOICE: (D) Hey guys. A big hello to all of you onboard from everyone here at the Khlecht Entity Inc.\nKHLECHT VOICE: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: Oh no. No, no, no.\nKHLECHT VOICE: (D) We’re thrilled to be able to share with you the good news that, following a successful takeover bid three point five seconds ago, this vessel and all holdings of the Spivelyn Empire are now the property of the Khlecht Entity. That includes all personnel on board.\nKHLECHT VOICE: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: Acquisitor? Is this true?\nACQUISTOR PRIME: (D) Bondsman. It is with regret that I have to inform you that I’ve been persuaded to step aside. Good luck with all your future endeavours. Former Acquisitor Prime out!\nACQUISTOR PRIME: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: But — what do I do now? Acquisitor!!!\nKHLECHT VOICE: (D) Bondsman! Just a quick heads up to let you know that the Khlecht’s own brand of mind-controlling gas will shortly be flooding the entire ship to ensure you remain loyal to your new employers. We can’t wait to start working with you. Catch you later!\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 122 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: BONDSMAN TANGO-VELDT: (COUGHING) Oh! .. I knew I should have been a librarian.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 123 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69. INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nWILL: So where is New Peerlessness now?\nDOCTOR: I have a room in the TARDIS called The Star Chamber. It has a small galaxy inside. I’ve placed New Peerlessness there. Amongst the stars.\nWILL: Will the TARDIS be able to take the strain?\nDOCTOR: She’1ll have to.\nWILL: You’re not certain-?\nDOCTOR: (SNAPS) I had no choice. (RELENTING) Would you like to see the Star Chamber for yourself? Would that set your mind at ease?\nWILL: Yes. Thank you. That would be fascinating.\nDOCTOR: Splendid. This way, Mr Arrowsmith!\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR WALKS AWAY AND, ALMOST RELUCTANTLY, WILL FOLLOWS.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 124 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70. EXT. WOODS OF MINOS\nSCHALK: The craft is rotating normally again.\nKLEIN: Then we’ve missed our only chance.\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Hi guys! This is the voice of the Khlecht Entity Inc, proud new owners of the Spivelyn Empire.\nHINTERBERGER: The Khlecht? What is going on?\nKLEIN: At a guess — it seems like the Khlecht have bought an entire Empire just to get at you, Herr Schalk.\nSCHALK: That doesn’t flatter me particularly. I would do the same were I in their position.\nKHLECHT VOICE: (TANNOY) Hey, Kurt. You’1ll find us a little bit more robust in our methods than the guys from Spivelyn. If you don’t give yourself up to the tractor beam of this ship immediately we’1l remove you by force and wipe this island from the map. Not that we want to sound heavy about it... that’s just the way we feel.\nSCHALK: I find I like the sound of this Entity even more. Do you know what I scent here?\nHINTERBERGER: Kurt?\nSCHALK: Opportunity.\nKLEIN: Schalk, think very carefully before you act. The Doctor would (not want you)-\nSCHALK: The Doctor is a fool. Goodbye, Lukas.\nSCHALK: OUTSTRETCHED.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 125 of 129\nSCHALK: Guten abend! Here I am! Kurt Schalk! Take me whenever you\nSCHALK: TAKING HIM INTO THE SHIP. THE SHIP FLIES AWAY IMMEDIATELY.\nKLEIN: And there they go. This is not good at all. We need to find the Doctor and tell him what’s happened.\nHINTERBERGER: You do what you want. I’m leaving.\nKLEIN: No, you’re not. You’re coming back to the beach with me, where we'll wait for the TARDIS.\nHINTERBERGER: How do you intend to stop me, Klein? You have no weapon of any kind. Despite my lack of athleticism I fancy I could overpower you with ease. Do not tempt me to try.\nKLEIN: Please. Lukas. You of all people know what’s in Schalk’s mind. If it were to fall into the wrong hands — into any hands! — it\nKLEIN: could do immeasurable damage.\nHINTERBERGER: I no longer care. You are weak, “Elizabeth”. Impotent. And you are nothing like her at all.\nKLEIN: Like who? The woman you mistook me for, in the base?\nHINTERBERGER: Goodbye... Fraulein. We will not meet again.\nKLEIN: Hinterberger! Wait! Wait! (BEAT) So much for my field work.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 126 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 72. INT. TARDIS — STAR CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: WILL AND THE DOCTOR ARE WATCHING THE STARS.\nDOCTOR: And there she is. New Peerlessness. Nestled amongst the stars.\nWILL: Won’t these Struwwelpeter realise what’s been done to them? Won’t they know they’re no longer in normal space?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. I hope they’1ll live out their lives in tranquil ignorance. I hope they’1ll find some peace.\nWILL: But if they were ever to realise. If they were ever to figure it out.\nDOCTOR: Then they’d be here. In my TARDIS. Where I could deal with them.\nWILL: Deal with them? What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It means the situation is under control for now. At least, until I can find a more lasting solution. However — there’s one small favour I have to ask of you, Will.\nWILL: Go on.\nDOCTOR: Don’t tell Dr Klein about this. Oh, tell her about New Peerlessness by all means. But not about the planet’s present whereabouts. You understand?\nWILL: Not really.\nDOCTOR: There’s some connection between Klein, Schalk and these beings. Some link I’ve not yet fathomed. And until I do...\nWILL: (DOUBTFUL) If you think it best, Doctor... Mum’s the word.\nDOCTOR: Good. Come along, Mr Arrowsmith. We still have work to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 127 of 129\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. EXT. TAVERNA\nDOCTOR WHO: KLEIN, HALF-IRRITATED, HALF-DISCONSOLATE, IS SITTING OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE TAVERNA. IT IS STILL RAINING.\nWILL: Dr Klein!\nKLEIN: Hello, Will.\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLOSING TARDIS DOOR) Rain on Minos? In the summer? I’m glad I brought my umbrella. (HE OPENS HIS UMBRELLA) But not ordinary rain, I think. Rain caused by some extraterrestrial atmospheric disturbance.\nWILL: Really?\nDOCTOR: What’s been happening here, Klein? Where’s Hinterberger? Where’s Schalk?\nKLEIN: I think you must mean “Hello, Dr Klein. How good to see you again. What on earth has happened to make you look so miserable and bedraggled”? But it’s been a long day for all of us so, on this occasion, I’1ll overlook the slight.\nDOCTOR: Elizabeth. Please.\nKLEIN: Hinterberger’s fled. He’s loose somewhere on the island. And Schalk’s been taken. By what started out as a Spivelyn ship but which then seemed to become an arm of the Khlecht Entity.\nDOCTOR: The Khlecht again? And I thought I’d scared the Spivelyn away.\nKLEIN: It would seem your reputation’s not all you think it is.\nWILL: The Khlecht will be looking to make a profit from Schalk, won’t they? As fast as possible.\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 128 of 129\nDOCTOR: You're right. But they’1l have sold him on by now. Khlecht trades happen in a fraction of a heartbeat.\nKLEIN: So Schalk could be anywhere?\nDOCTOR: And within him lies the secret of the Persuasion Machine.\nKLEIN: A Machine like that could wreak untold devastation on the universe.\nDOCTOR: We have to find him, Dr Klein.\nKLEIN: But what about the Struwwelpeter? How do we know they won’t come back?\nDOCTOR: They’1l not return to this place. I’ve put them out of reach. All that is left to show that they were ever here is dust and ashes. And the rain will soon wash those away. (DECISIVELY) Come on. (FX: OPENING TARDIS DOOR)\nWILL: Wait! — Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: (FROM INSIDE TARDIS) Quick, before the trail goes cold!\nKLEIN: We’re going after answers, Will. We’re going after Schalk!\nKLEIN: CLOSING MUSIC.\nKLEIN: AFTER A MOMENT’S PAUSE, WE CUT TO THE FINAL, POST-CREDITS\nDOCTOR WHO: PERSUASION by Jonathan Barnes (FINAL) Page 129 of\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. EXT. GREEN FIELDS OF NEW PEERLESSNESS\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEPHERDESS ARE STROLLING THROUGH LONG GRASS.\nSHEPHERD: Then think you not that there is beauty here? Tranquillity and silence and great peace?\nSHEPHERD: And think you not that though we have been gulled There was a certain justice in the act?\nSHEPHERD: It seems most apt to end in such a place,\nSHEPHERD: This bounteous cell, this iron-clad paradise.\nSHEPHERDESS: Thou speaks some truth, my noble lord, ‘tis so. And, aye, ‘tis sweet to walk in such a place With thou most tender hand in mine. And yet...\nSHEPHERD: Oh, my dear lady. Thou doth seem to me\nSHEPHERD: To still be greatly troubled in thy mind.\nSHEPHERD: Thy sweet blue eyes declare some hidden pain. Pray, tell me of the sorrow in thy heart.\nSHEPHERDESS: As we have walked together, I the heav’ns\nSHEPHERDESS: Hath watched and mapped and it doth seem to me The order of them hath been overthrown\nSHEPHERDESS: And by some secret art been wholly changed.\nSHEPHERDESS: I fear we are no more where once we were,\nSHEPHERDESS: And that this prison hath another wall.\nSHEPHERD: Now, think not of these things, my love. No more. Our time is brief. The sands run faster now.\nSHEPHERD: This finite age I wish to spend with thee\nSHEPHERD: In thy dear gaze and gentle company.\nSHEPHERD: So think no more of grief or sorrow, please. These horrid speculations put away.\nSHEPHERDESS: I will my Lord. But only for today.\nSHEPHERDESS: THEY WALK ON, THROUGH THE LONG GRASS, INTO THE DISTANCE.\nSHEPHERDESS: THE END\nSHEPHERDESS: 129"
