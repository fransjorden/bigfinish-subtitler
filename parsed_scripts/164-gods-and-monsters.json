Wait. (BEAT, UNSURE) Was I black? Or was I white? (DISTRAUGHT) Which side was I playing?\nDOCTOR: So.. we play the game again.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 1: INT.

(SEEING FENRIC) Ah, and your get-up.\nFENRIC: The warlord whose body I wear would have called this world ‘Asgard’. But you may call it ‘Hell’.\nDOCTOR: There’s no such place.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 3\nFENRIC: We shall see.\nDOCTOR: Play your games if you must. (BRIGHTLY) How about hide and seek? Off you pop, I’1ll be along ina bit.\nFENRIC: You know the game I like to play. Don’t you? Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) Chess.\nFENRIC: The game of gods. The pawns are assembled, the rooks and knights and bishops in formation.\nDOCTOR: I beat you once. I’m in no mood for a rematch.\nFENRIC: You have no choice, Time Lord. Your TARDIS has just arrived in this domain. Your little friends, come to your rescue. Oh, what a game this will be!\nDOCTOR: (GROANING) Of course. They must have found the shield.\nFENRIC: (EXCITED) The shield? Weyland’s Shield?\nDOCTOR: Following Weyland’s Shield is what dragged me into this game of yours. I should have known better.\nFENRIC: Oh, but this is perfect! Weyland’s Shield, full of fire and magic. Weyland’s Shield, that will give me the power to realise my true potential!

What’s keeping you?\nHEX: (EXITING, HEFTING SAXON SHIELD) Figured if the Doctor went to all those lengths to get hold of Weyland’s Shield, makes sense to bring it with us.\nACE: It’s just dead weight, Hex.\nHEX: (FX: CLOSES DOOR) Says the woman with a rucksack full of explosives.\nACE: Oi!\nHEX: (LOOKING AROUND) Hold up. Are we on Mars?\nACE: I’ve been to Mars, Hex. Trust me, this isn’t Mars.\nARISTIDES: (FX: SLIGHTLY OFF, BY STREAM) Look, there’s a stream.\nHEX: (FX: FOLLOW HIM AS HE CROSSES TO ARISTIDES) Do you not get streams on Mars?\nARISTIDES: Depends when on Mars.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 5\nSALLY: (COMING UP BESIDE) Ace is right. This isn’t Mars.\nACE: (COMING UP BESIDE) See, even Private Benjamin knows this isn’t — [Mars] (BREAKS OFF, TO SALLY) Hang about, how do you know this isn’t Mars?\nSALLY: I went to Mars. With the Doctor. He wanted to check up on some old hieroglyphics, in the tomb of an ancient star-god. (TO ARISTIDES) Captain, this isn’t Mars.\nARISTIDES: Fine, so it isn’t [Mars!]\nHEX: (PULLED GENTLY BY SHIELD) Whoa!\nACE: Hex? This is no time to do your Pilates.\nHEX: The shield. It, like, pulled me! (FX: HUM — PULLED AGAIN) Aah!\nSALLY: Captain, the shield! The runes on the shield — they’re glowing!\nHEX: See, what’d I tell you?\nARISTIDES: The shield gave the TARDIS the co-ordinates for here, wherever\nARISTIDES: here is.\nACE: So?\nARISTIDES: So, I reckon it knows where it wants to go.\nSALLY: You mean, we should follow it?\nHEX: Downstream. It wants to go downstream.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 6\nACE: Guess downstream it is, then.\nARISTIDES: Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: INT.

Look!\nSALLY: Is that a body?\nARISTIDES: Bodies plural, Private.\nSALLY: Plural-?\nARISTIDES: Alright, everyone stay calm!\nACE: No-one’s panicking, Lysandra.\nHEX: Speak for yourself, Ace.\nARISTIDES: (WALKING) They look like Vikings.\nACE: (WALKING) Saxons.\nARISTIDES: (WALKING) Same difference. (FX: ALL STOP) Schofield, you’re\nARISTIDES: medic. What killed them?\nARISTIDES: the\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 9\nACE: (SARCASTIC) I’m just guessing, but maybe having their throats torn out-—?\nARISTIDES: Yes, but what did it? Knives, swords, what-?\nHEX: (EXAMINING BODY) Teeth and claws, it looks like.\nARISTIDES: Wild animals, then?\nSALLY: (SLIGHTLY OFF) No. Over here.\nARISTIDES: What’s that you’ve found, Morgan?\nSALLY: Fella here was packing a GPMG.\nHEX: Looks like a machine gun.\nARISTIDES: General Purpose Machine Gun, yes.\nSALLY: There’s spent cartridges all over. What sort of wild animal couldn’t they fight off with a machine gun?\nACE: More to the point, Saxons with machine guns? This place is weird.\nHEX: (FX: PICKING GUN OUT OF WATER) It gets weirder.\nSALLY: What’s that?\nHEX: I dunno. Some kind of — (BEAT) — space gun.\nACE: Mate, is that the best you can come up with?\nHEX: Well, how should I know what sort of gun it is?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 10\nARISTIDES: Looks simple enough. A child could use it. So try it, Schofield.\nHEX: Eh-?\nARISTIDES: What’s so hard? Point it, squeeze the trigger, ruin someone’s day.\nHEX: Yeah, alright, Captain. (BEAT) No, doesn’t work.\nARISTIDES: (FX: SPLASHES OVER TO HEX) Like this. Point, squeeze and — (FX: BER-WHUMP FROM ALIEN GUN) See? Easy.\nHEX: I’m telling you, it wouldn’t work for me!\nARISTIDES: (PASSING GUN) Morgan, show him.\nSALLY: Stand back. (SHOOTS)\nARISTIDES: There you go.\nHEX: Well, why wouldn’t it work for me, then-?\nSALLY: It’s alien tech, maybe it won’t work for —\nACE: (WITHERINGLY) Humans?\nSALLY: . Men. Males. Ace, you try it.\nACE: Oi, you calling me a bloke?\nHEX: Just do it, Ace.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 11\nACE: OK. So maybe Private Benjamin’s onto something.\nSALLY: The only thing is — if it doesn’t work for males, why was a man holding it?\nACE: Maybe that’s why he’s dead?\nARISTIDES: The headline is, three of us can use it. And there’s all sorts lying around, so —\nACE: . Let’s tool up, shall we, ladies?\nHEX: Ace. The Doctor doesn’t like guns.\nACE: Didn’t like guns, Hex. These days, seems he’s quite comfortable hanging out with people who do. (HOISTING GPMG) So if we can’t beat, them — (FX: KA-CHUNK OF SAFETY CATCH) — guess we’re just going to have to join them, right?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: INT. FENRIC’S KEEP — HALL\nFENRIC: (MURMURED, SENDING PSYCHIC MESSAGE) Ancient One. Come to me.\nDOCTOR: Do you know what it is I don’t understand about you, Fenric? You and the rest of the Elder Gods?\nFENRIC: (IRRITATED) Oh, do enlighten me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: . Still, after countless years in the outer darkness, still all you can think of to do with yourselves is play your stupid games. In all these endless millennia, haven’t you once thought of anything better to do with your time?\nFENRIC: You are too small, your mind is too narrow.\nDOCTOR: But what’s the point?\nFENRIC: Poor Doctor. Your mortal realm of stars and planets and people — you really believe that it matters.\nDOCTOR: Of course it matters!\nFENRIC: These games of gods are reality, Doctor. They are all there is. They are the point.\nANCIENT ONE: (ENTERING; VOICE GUTTURAL AND SAD, AS PER ‘CURSE OF FENRIC’ — BUT WITH THE FAINTEST POSSIBLE HINT OF HIS PERSIAN ORIGINS) Fenric. You bade me come.\nFENRIC: Ah, Ancient One. There are strangers, out on the plain. Bring them to me.\nANCIENT ONE: I.. must obey.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 13\nFENRIC: You must. Yes.\nANCIENT ONE: Then... I shall summon the Haemovores. (FX: EXITS)\nDOCTOR: (FX: TWISTING IN CHAINS) No!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: EXT. RIVER’S EDGE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP STREAM, WIDENING TO RIVER. 4 X PEOPLE TRAMPING ON:\nHEX: & SALLY AHEAD; BUT WE’RE WITH ACE & ARISTIDES, LAGGING BEHIND)\nACE: . SO anyway, after I blew the school cupboard up, I bunked off school and went home. There was nothing to do, so I ended up watching kids’ TV. Jimbo and the Jet Set.\nARISTIDES: Oh. I loved that. The little planes!\nACE: Well funny, wasn’t it? You’1ll watch anything when there’s nothing on.\nARISTIDES: No, I meant I used to love it as a child.\nACE: It was only a couple of years ago.\nARISTIDES: 1986? 87?\nACE: Something like that.\nARISTIDES: (STOPPING, REALISATION) Ace, I was four.\nACE: But — you’re old enough to be my Mum!\nARISTIDES: Actually, you’re old enough to be [mine. ]\nSALLY: (FX: RETURNING FROM OFF, FOLLOWED BY HEX) Back! Back!\nACE: Hold up, the other two have seen something.\nARISTIDES: What is it, Private?\nSALLY: Column of soldiers. Over the ridge, in the far distance.\nHEX: Yeah, headed back the way we came.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 15\nARISTIDES: What sort of soldiers?\nSALLY: I couldn’t see clearly in the mist.\nACE: Mist?\nSALLY: Yeah, rolling in from the east.\nHEX: I saw them. All dressed up like refugees from Aladdin. Scimitars and that.\nACE: We should talk to them.\nARISTIDES: (IGNORING HER) What’s the shield say, Schofield?\nHEX: Guess it wants us to carry on.\nARISTIDES: Then we carry on.\nACE: Lysandra. They might know something-!\nSALLY: Or they might just cut us to ribbons. The Captain’s right.\nACE: Unlike you, Private, she’s not the boss of me. (HOISTING BACKPACK) Look, I’1l catch you up, alright?\nHEX: Ace, what are you playing at-?\nACE: (JOGGING OFF) I’1l be five minutes. Ten minutes. Ish!\nHEX: (CALLING AFTER) Ace. Ace!!! (TO SALLY) Too late. She’s won’t see nothing in that mist.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 16\nSALLY: Ace can look after herself.\nHEX: Thinks she can, Sal. Big difference.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT. RAVINE\nACE: (MUTTERING TO SELF) .. Yes, Captain. No, Captain. Would you like your boots blacked, Captain? (BEAT) Right, then. North-west, I guess. Pff, she wasn’t wrong about this [mist-!]\nHURMZID: (FROM OFF) Drop your weapon, warrior woman.\nACE: (TO SELF) Walked straight into that, didn’t I-?\nACE: (FX: FROM OFF, BER-WHUMP OF ALIEN GUN, AS BEFORE. SHOWER OF ROCKS,\nSTONES: )\nHURMZID: (OFF) I said, drop your weapon!\nACE: (LOUD) Alright, alright! (FX: SETS GPMG ON GROUND; SIMULTANEOUSLY,\nHURMZID: SCRAMBLES DOWN RIDGE, TOWARDS ACE) Consider it dropped. Not my bag, anyhow.\nHURMZID: (APPROACHING) This is not your bag? On your back?\nACE: What, the rucksack? No, that’s mine. I meant the whole ‘guns’ thing.\nHURMZID: (WITH HER) What kind of creature are you-?\nACE: My name’s Ace, I’m from a dysfunctional family, and I cope by blowing things up. What’s your excuse... Aladdin?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. FENRIC’S KEEP — HALL\nDOCTOR: So, Fenric, you’ve found yourself a new Ancient One. You do realise how absurd that sounds?\nFENRIC: You mock and sneer, because you are scared.\nDOCTOR: Of course I’m scared! You’re quite insane and quite ridiculously powerful. That thing, the Ancient One. What corrupted future did you dredge him up from?\nFENRIC: I told you. We are in Hell. Your future, your present, your past — your Time is meaningless, Time Lord. Look out of my Keep, and all you will see is a sky of red; red because the stars in the newborn sky are all so close together that there is neither day or night.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, newborn? How far back are we?\nFENRIC: To me, Doctor, your universe is less than a millionth of a second old. In the blink of my undying eye, it will be a burst bubble. All of your future, all of your past, the whole of your reality — we Elder Gods perceive it as no more than you perceive a single speck of dust. To us, your everything is nothing. There is nothing here... but us.\nDOCTOR: If we mortals are really nothing, why bother with us at all? Why not just leave us all alone?\nFENRIC: And what do you think would happen if we did?\nDOCTOR: Nothing, by your reckoning!\nFENRIC: Precisely, Doctor. Nothing would happen. Simply, nothing. There would be only nothing. And that isn’t anything, is it?\nDOCTOR: You need us, don’t you? You need our universe to be the something to your nothing. You need us to give you scale!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 19\nFENRIC: Perhaps.\nDOCTOR: Oh, but don’t you see, Fenric? We mortal nothings can happily live without you, but your lives are meaningless without ours. That makes us greater than you!\nFENRIC: (ANNOYED; MORE TO SELF) Can it be? That I’m debating philosophy with a speck of dust, when there’s a game to be played?\nFENRIC: (FX: ‘WIND’ WHIPS UP — AND FENRIC TELEPORTS AWAY, AS IN ‘CURSE OF FENRIC’ )\nDOCTOR: (ALOUD) Go on, then, disappear! Just as soon as you’re losing the argument!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. RAVINE\nHURMZID: My name is not Aladdin, warrior woman. I am Hurmzid, Prince of Persia. I am looking for my guards. We became separated, in the mist.\nACE: Yeah, well — they went that-a-way.\nHURMZID: That-a-way?\nACE: (FX: HOISTING BACKPACK) C’mon, follow me.\nHURMZID: But - you are my prisoner!\nACE: Look, Hurmzid, Prince of Persia — do you want to find your guards or not?\nHURMZID: I do.\nACE: Well, then — let’s find them, shall we?\nHURMZID: (WALKING) You know what lies this way, warrior woman?\nACE: (WALKING) Ace. And all that lies this way is a load of dead Saxons. Come to think of it — you’re from a different time period, aren’t you?\nHURMZID: (WALKING) ‘Time... period’?\nACE: (WALKING) Age. Epoch. (SIGHS) Just give us some names of people and places, recent events?\nHURMZID: (WALKING) My father is the Emperor Shapur. He defeated the Roman army at the battle of Edessa and took their emperor prisoner.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 21\nACE: Never heard of him. (STOPS; SUDDENLY SINKING IN) Sorry, did you say he beat the Romans?\nHURMZID: Yes.\nACE: Respect.\nHURMZID: (WALKING) The Romans were cut off without reinforcements, struck down by a mystery plague.\nACE: (WALKING) What sort of plague?\nHURMZID: (WALKING) My father made a deal with an ancient spirit. A djinni. He gave him a magic potion called “Anthrax”.\nACE: (WALKING) That’s disgusting.\nHURMZID: (WALKING) In return for this help, the spirit took my father away, and he has not been seen since. But then I heard the djinni had again been sighted, playing dice on the road to Byzantium. So I sneaked into the demon’s tent, and stole a talisman imbued with all his power.\nACE: What sort of talisman?\nHURMZID: (STOPPING) Here, I keep it around my belt.\nACE: It’s a hammer. A little hammer.\nHURMZID: It has an enchantment upon it. It conjures up a powerful spell called a “time storm”, that brought [me and my guards]\nACE: (SUDDENLY SCARED) Did you say —\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 22\nHURMZID: A time storm, yes. It brought me and my guards here, to this plain of mists and monsters. (SADLY) I wished then that I had heeded the advice of the strange little Doctor I had met on the high road, who warned me never to tangle with demons [and devils —]\nACE: Right. Gonna stop you there, Hurmzid, because we’ve suddenly got way more in common than you can possibly imagine —\nACE: (FX: CUT SHORT BY A ZOMBIE-LIKE GROANING FROM AHEAD; A MASS OF\nHAEMOVORES: APPROACHING )\nACE: Hang about. What was that you said about monsters-?\nHURMZID: They are coming! The monsters are coming!\nACE: Please. Tell me these monsters of yours aren’t mostly a mouldy blue colour, and in urgent need of a manicure?\nHURMZID: (DESPERATE) My guards! What has happened to my guards?\nACE: Too late for them, Hurmzid. (FX: APPROACHING HAEMOVORES PAUSE)\nACE: That lot, they’re called Haemovores. They got the name from drinking blood.\nHURMZID: Drinking... blood?\nACE: Don’t just stand there, your Highness — run!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT. RIVER’S EDGE/WORLD’S EDGE\nHEX: (WALKING) Ace should have been back by now.\nARISTIDES: (WALKING) Let’s just push on, shall we?\nSALLY: (STOPPING) Hold up.\nARISTIDES: What is it, Private?\nSALLY: Up ahead. It sounds like a waterfall.\nARISTIDES: Looks more like a lake.\nSALLY: Something’s not right. Look, I won’t be a moment. (FX: DASHES OFF)\nARISTIDES: Private! Private Morgan! Come back!\nHEX: Trouble in the ranks, Lysandra?\nARISTIDES: Follow me, Schofield.\nARISTIDES: (FX: SHE RUSHES AFTER SALLY. CROSS TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE. WATER\nTHUNDERING: OFF THE EDGE... BUT INTO NOTHING, EMPTY SPACE)\nSALLY: (FX: RUSHES TO SUDDEN STOP) Aaah!\nARISTIDES: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) I gave you an order, Private..!\nSALLY: (CALLING) Stop! Captain, stop! Don’t go near the water!\nARISTIDES: (OFF, STOPPED) What-?\nSALLY: It’s not a waterfall!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 24\nHEX: (OFF) Well, what is it? Sal?\nSALLY: It’s the edge! Come round the outside, you’ll see!\nARISTIDES: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) The edge of what?\nSALLY: (PERHAPS TO SELF?) It’s incredible. Like nothing I’ve ever seen...\nARISTIDES: (FX: ARRIVING, WITH HEX) What are you on about, Pri- [-vate?] (REALISATION) Oh my stars.\nSALLY: See? The edge. The edge of the world!\nARISTIDES: (TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT) We followed a river.\nSALLY: Yes, and look! It just runs straight off, into... well —\nHEX: . Space.\nSALLY: Space, exactly!\nARISTIDES: What is this place-?\nHEX: Whatever it is, it’s flat. This world is flat!\nSALLY: Yes, and we nearly walked off the edge of it!\nACE: (WELL OFF, RUNNING, CALLING) Hex! Run!!!\nHEX: Hold up, there’s Ace!\nACE: (WELL OFF, RUNNING, CALLING) Leg it! Run!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 25\nARISTIDES: What’s she saying?\nSALLY: Yes, and who’s that with her?\nHURMZID: (BY ACE) The monsters are almost upon us!!!\nHEX: Looks like one of them Arabian Nights guys. (CALLING) Over here!!!\nARISTIDES: They’re running. What are they running from?\nARISTIDES: (FX: CROSS TO ACE & HURMZID. BEHIND THEM — HAEMOVORES SURGING FORWARD, GROANING)\nHURMZID: (RUNNING) The stars preserve us!\nACE: (RUNNING, CALLING) Hex! Sal! Lysandra! Don’t just sit there like lemons! Run!!!\nSALLY: There’s people behind them, in the mist.\nARISTIDES: Maybe it’s the rest of that column. Be just like McShane to anatagonise them.\nHEX: No, it’s not them.\nARISTIDES: How can you tell? From this distance?\nHEX: Well — me eyesight’s not perfect, but I’m pretty sure they weren’t blue. Not that I’m saying that blue’s bad necessarily. I mean, you travel with the Doctor, you soon learn that appearances aren’t everything. People who might look scary sometimes turn out to be (HESITANTLY) quite (LESS SURE) friendly. Are those suckers?\nSALLY: Captain, you were wondering what killed those Saxons...\nARISTIDES: I think we just found out.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 26\nACE: (RUNNING UP) Come on!!! You lot! What’re you all just standing around for?\nHURMZID: (JUST BEHIND) The monsters are coming! Run!!!\nARISTIDES: Just one problem, McShane.\nACE: Oh, what? You feel like re-enacting Custard’s Last Stand, I suppose?\nSALLY: (CORRECTING HER) Custer’s Last Stand.\nACE: Shut it!\nHEX: Thing is, Ace, there’s nowhere to run to.\nACE: Yeah, well — we don’t go in the water. (FX: CLAMBERING PAST THEM,\nTOWARDS: EDGE; THUNDERING WATERFALL) But we can always go around the outs- [ide —]\nARISTIDES: See?\nACE: Is that... space?\nHEX: Flat planet.\nACE: Bad one.\nARISTIDES: No way forward, no way back, mist rolling in from the east and\nARISTIDES: the west. (GRIM) Looks like Custard’s Last Stand it is.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: EXT. RIVER’S EDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nANCIENT ONE: Beware the water, my brothers. It\nANCIENT ONE: is not safe in the water. There\nANCIENT ONE: are.. undercurrents, that will drag you from the plain.\nANCIENT ONE: Hush. Our master arrives.\nFENRIC: Ancient One. How goes the game?\nANCIENT ONE: The pieces are on the far edge of\nANCIENT ONE: move forward, nor back.\nFENRIC: (SCANNING THE EDGE) The shield. I\nFENRIC: the board.

WORLD’S EDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nSALLY: They’ve stopped moving. There’s a man, talking to the big blue Boss.\nHEX: The Viking guy?\nSALLY: With these strange green eyes.\nACE: Fenric. Hoped I’d never live to see him again.\nHURMZID: But — that is the djinni! The demon who took my father!\nARISTIDES: Sorry, who’s this?\nACE: His highness Prince Hurmzid. His Dad beat the Romans, so he’s probably a good bloke on your side in a fight, if he’s anything like his Dad.\nHEX: Alright?\nACE: Hurmzid’s from Persia. He knew the Professor, once.\nARISTIDES: That’s quite a coincidence.\nACE: Oh no. No coincidence. You see, I first met the Professor on a planet called Iceworld. I’d been taken there by a time storm.\nHURMZID: I, too, was carried away from my home.\nSALLY: So who’s this Fenric?\nACE: Scumbag from the dawn of time, according to the Professor.\nHEX: The Doctor called someone a “scumbag?”\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 29\nACE: I’m painting a picture. Fenric played the Professor at chess,\nACE: only Fenric lost, and the Professor sealed him up inside a bottle. Trouble is, a few hundred years later, the bottle got stolen by a bunch of Vikings, who tried to take it back to Norway. The curse followed them, they were all turned into Haemovores.\nHEX: Don’t tell me. The blue guys in the mist?\nARISTIDES: “Haemovores”. As in haemotologist, as in blood? Something that eats blood?\nSALLY: Vampires?\nACE: Pretty much.\nHEX: Today just gets better and better.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: EXT. RIVER’S EDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nANCIENT ONE: My brothers would feed, Lord Fenric.\nFENRIC: No. No! The shieldmaidens protect the shield. And if the shield is lost, so too is the game. This is a fool’s mate, Ancient One!\nANCIENT ONE: Why do you call me that? This universe is young. There is nothing ancient here.\nFENRIC: You were old when I summoned you, were you not? So numbed by your conquests that you welcomed the burn of Hell. (DECISIVELY) No, only a daring play will deliver me the shield. A change of tactics.\nANCIENT ONE: Then... make your move, my Lord.\nFENRIC: (EFFORT — BRINGING UP HUGE TIME STORM TO WHISK AWAY HIMSELF, AND THE HAEMOVORES) Castling. The King’s leap. The King exchanged... for his Keep!\nFENRIC: (FX: TIME STORM SOUNDS AND HAEMOVORE GROANS CROSSFADE INTO HUGE\nSTONE: GRINDING... AND A THUNDEROUS CHUD!

WORLD’S EDGE [CONTINUOUS]\nHURMZID: (FEARFUL) Look! Fenric’s Keep!\nHEX: (ASTONISHMENT) Whoa! Where did that come from?\nARISTIDES: More to the point, where did the Haemovores go?\nACE: Time storm. Fenric’s playing games with us.\nSALLY: What did you call that, your Highness? Fenric’s Keep?\nHURMZID: It is. But the last time I saw it, it was ten leagues to the east!\nHEX: Hang about. That’s more than a Keep. That’s a rook.\nARISTIDES: What are you on about, Schofield?\nACE: A rook. A castle, in chess.\nSALLY: She’s right, Captain. It’s a chesspiece. A giant chesspiece!\nARISTIDES: But that’s impossible!\nACE: Lysandra. We’re standing on a flat world floating in space populated by zombie Vikings, and you call that impossible?\nARISTIDES: Fair point, McShane.\nACE: Fenric plays games, that’s his M.O. Chess, that’s his favourite. Anyone here play chess? (SHORT BEAT) Oh well, worth a [try —]\nSALLY: I used to play a bit. You know, after school. Chess club.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 32\nARISTIDES: Well, well. Aren’t you the dark horse, Morgan?\nSALLY: (BLUSHING) I wasn’t very good, or anything. Well, I was the district champion two years running, but the competition wasn’t all that [strong]\nACE: (BUTTING IN) A dark horse. (SUSPICIOUS) That’s a black knight, isn’t it?\nSALLY: I suppose.\nHEX: Hold on, Ace, what’re you saying?\nACE: I’m saying there’s no such thing as coincidence, not where Fenric’s concerned.\nARISTIDES: It was only a figure of speech, McShane. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Hurmzid — your Highness — what else do you know about this Keep?\nHURMZID: The Keep is where Fenric holds my father. Where he holds all of his prisoners.\nHEX: Prisoners? So what’s the betting that in the very next cel1l...?\nSALLY: Captain, the Doctor’s in there! He must be!\nARISTIDES: Right then. Fenric’s made his move. That means it’s our turn.\nHEX: You mean — attack the Keep? How?\nARISTIDES: These (COUGH) “space guns” seem to work well enough.\nACE: You want to watch it, Lysandra. Fenric, he’s like a Grandmaster. Which I guess makes us the Furious Five.\nSALLY: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 33\nACE: Eighties reference. You wouldn’t get it.\nARISTIDES: Alright, McShane. (TO ALL) We proceed with all due caution — agreed?\nARISTIDES: I’1ll take that as a ‘Yes, Captain’. Come on.\nHURMZID: Ace. I made you drop your... “Space gun”.\nACE: (HOISTING RUCKSACK) Not to worry, your Highness. I’ve still got my rucksack.\nHURMZID: But do you not feel fear?\nACE: Oh, I feel fear, alright. I know all about Fenric. But if Fenric’s got the Professor in there, then he’s the one who needs to be scared, because I know exactly how I’m getting the Professor out.\nHURMZID: I wish I had your faith.\nACE: Yeah. A rucksack packed full of unshakeable faith. Go on, your Highness.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. FENRIC’S KEEP — HALL\nDOCTOR: (TWISTING IN CHAINS) Who’s that? Who’s there?\nANCIENT ONE: You have nothing to fear, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, “Ancient One”. Listen, whatever Fenric’s threatened you with, whatever hold he has on you, I can help. I’ve fought him before. He can be contained.\nANCIENT ONE: In the earthly realm, perhaps. But not here, in the darkness before creation.\nDOCTOR: All the same. Release me from these chains. Let me try. (BEAT; ANNOYED) What’s the matter, don’t you want me to save you?\nANCIENT ONE: You should know, Doctor — I am beyond salvation.\nDOCTOR: I should know? Why should I know? (BEAT) Who are you, Ancient One? — or rather, who were you? Did I know you, once? Will I know you?\nANCIENT ONE: I am lost and forsaken. That is all. (TURNING, EXITING) You will remain here until Fenric decides your fate.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) My fate? Fenric decided that a long time ago.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. FENRIC’S KEEP\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: RIVER’S EDGE OFF. ARISTIDES, SALLY, HEX, HURMZID AND ACE RUN UP TO GATE AND STOP)\nARISTIDES: (SOTTO) OK. Main gate — looks to be... (LOOKS) — wide open.\nACE: There’s no point in whispering, Lysandra. It’s obvious. He knows we're coming. He’s inviting us in.\nHEX: What are those carvings of? On the gate?\nACE: Wolves.\nARISTIDES: Plan of attack, Morgan?\nSALLY: We go in in a diamond formation. Fastest first — guess that’s me. Covering fire to the left and right — that’1l be you and McShane. Anyone tries to take us from behind, they’1ll be at close quarters — so that’s one for Hurmzid, and his scimitar.\nARISTIDES: Very good, Private.\nHEX: Hey, what about me?\nARISTIDES: You — hold our coats, Schofield.\nACE: Here’s a better idea. As before, but Hurmzid stays behind with Hex.\nHURMZID: But — what about my father?\nACE: We won’t leave without him. But the fact is — Hex can’t fire these weapons, for some reason. So someone needs to cover him.\nHEX: I’m not completely useless.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 36\nACE: No-one said you were. (FX: THUMP OF BAG ON GROUND) Hurmzid — will you stay here, and look after my rucksack?\nHURMZID: I will not argue.\nACE: Oh, I like you! Now — give me that space gun of yours.\nARISTIDES: What, it works for him?\nACE: Yeah, it does, actually.\nHEX: I take it back. I am completely useless.\nACE: Trust me, someone might need a sticking plaster later. Oh! One more thing. Hurmzid — that hammer of yours...?\nHURMZID: You would take my talisman, too?\nACE: Please. If your father’s in there — I will find him, I promise.\nHURMZID: (PASSING IT) I believe I can trust you.\nACE: Just tell me how it works.\nHURMZID: You strike the ground and think of where you wish to be.\nACE: Cool.\nARISTIDES: Are you quite ready?\nACE: Yeah. Sally, Lysandra — you’re back-up in case it goes wrong.\nSALLY: In case what goes wrong?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 37\nACE: This. (RUNS TO GATES, SHOUTS) Oi! Fenric! The name’s Ace. Remember me?\nARISTIDES: (HISSED AFTER HER) McShane! (TO SALLY) What the hell does she think she’s playing at?\nSALLY: She’s already in. Better get after her, Ma’am.\nARISTIDES: Against my better judgement...\nHEX: Look after yourselves, ladies.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT.

Yes, I remember you.\nACE: See you’ve joined the Asterix Fan Club. (STORMING FORWARD) Where is he? Where’s the Doctor?\nFENRIC: There are so many ways I could kill you. Aren’t you afraid?\nACE: Yeah, but I’ve not made my move yet. You know the rules, Fenric. First I make my move, then you make yours.\nSALLY: (MOVING TO STOP) (SOTTO) He’s in range, Captain.\nARISTIDES: (SOTTO) Then let’s take him down.\nSALLY: (SOTTO) Shoot him?\nARISTIDES: fire!!!\nFENRIC: Ah. The shield maidens.\nFENRIC: How... amusing. That was your move, I believe?\nACE: (TURNING) You idiots! You didn’t really think that guns would work on him, did you?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 39\nARISTIDES: Well, you know. Space guns.\nSALLY: “Shield maidens”. What did he mean, “shield maidens”?\nFENRIC: If you prefer — the three witches. The maiden, the wife and the hag.\nARISTIDES: He’s calling you names, McShane.\nFENRIC: The Norn. The three women at the heart of all the chaos to come. You are here at last, as I always knew you would be.\nSALLY: Anyone know what he’s on about?\nACE: He’s completely hatstand. Just go with it.\nSALLY: (CONFUSED) Hatstand?\nACE: Sorry. Eighties thing again.\nARISTIDES: (STEPPING FORWARD) What are you on about, Fenric? ‘The chaos to\nARISTIDES: come’ ?\nFENRIC: Since you wish to be better informed — I summon a time storm!\nARISTIDES: & SALLY:\nFENRIC: Best, perhaps, that you experience these things at first hand.\nACE: Hey! Leave them alone!\nARISTIDES: (CAUGHT IN STORM) Stop it!\nSALLY: (DITTO) Ace! Help us —\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 40\nACE: Where have you sent them, Fenric?\nFENRIC: To their deaths, of course. Theirs, and that of everyone else on the dismal planet Earth.\nACE: And what about me? Aren’t I included?\nFENRIC: You, Dorothy McShane? You have your own personal hell to visit.\nACE: (IN TIME STORM) Go on, then. Do your [worst! —]\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: EXT.

(GETTING UP) So bright, I can’t see a thing.\nFENRIC: Let me help you gain your bearings. We are on a hill, an island of green surrounded by tarmac.

Might be Earth. Might not. Have to assume a hostile environment until proven otherwise. Smoke in the distance. Could be a settlement. Could be a dragon. (FRUSTRATION) Oh, this is useless! We could be anywhere in the whole of time or space.\nSALLY: We’re about ten miles from Swindon.\nARISTIDES: I beg your pardon?\nSALLY: Over there, that’s a dolmen — a Neolithic burial site. We’re on the Ridgeway Path, midway between Wantage and the M4. We came here on my Duke of Edinburgh's.\nARISTIDES: You’ve been here before? You’re certain?\nSALLY: Well, we might be in the Middle Ages. But I will be here at some\nSALLY: point in the early 20s, yeah. Funny, I’d forgotten all about that weekend. Sarah Dean brought her knitting. She was making a scarf\nSALLY: for Tom [Wateracre. ]\nARISTIDES: Yes, is there anything more I need to know?\nSALLY: The dolmen, it’s called [Weyland’s Smithy.

No — Persia!\nHURMZID: It is I, Doctor. Hurmzid —\nDOCTOR: Hurmzid, Prince of Persia, that’s it! What are you doing here? (DARK) The last time I saw you, I warned you never to tangle with demons.\nHURMZID: Wise advice. I only wish I had paid heed to it. (FX: CLANKING CHAINS) Here, let me help you with these chains. —\nDOCTOR: Yes, if only they were properly knotted I’d have been out of them long ago. But this random lash-up — it’s a disgrace!\nHURMZID: (FX: LETTING CHAINS GO) I cannot even see how they are linked!\nDOCTOR: Never underestimate the value of a well-tied knot, Hurmzid. I once said the same to Baden-Powell, but he had a lot on his mind. Half the boys had been bewitched by sprites, the other half had turned into werewolves. It had been a very odd weekend.\nHURMZID: Doctor, you are babbling.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, how’s your father doing? Has he released the Roman Emperor yet, or is he still using him as a footstool to get on his horse? I should have said something, but I didn’t want to invent the Geneva Convention two thousand years early.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 47\nHURMZID: It was my father I came here in search of. You have not seen him, I suppose?\nDOCTOR: No.\nHURMZID: I must find him.\nDOCTOR: And I’1l1 help you. But first things first. I don’t suppose you brought a hacksaw-?\nHURMZID: I did not.

(SETTING OFF) Come on, Private.\nSALLY: (FOLLOWING) We’re following them?\nARISTIDES: (STRIDING UP RIDGE) They’re going somewhere. They must be.\nSALLY: (FOLLOWING) But there’s nothing over that way. Only an old hill fort called Uffington Camp. Nothing there except a nice view of a big chalk horse carved in the hillside opposite. —\nSALLY: (FX: NOW WE’RE WITH ARISTIDES AT THE TOP OF THE HILL. 2 x\nHELICOPTERS: CIRCLING ABOVE. 1 x HELICOPTER TOUCHING DOWN BELOW,\nROTORS: SLOWING)\nARISTIDES: That, and a military base.\nLIEUTENANT: (FX: FAR BELOW) Black Knight One touched down.

Please?\nHURMZID: We must hurry. Fenric may return at any moment, and we have not yet found my father.\nACE: Fenric? He’s still in Perivale.\nDOCTOR: Perivale-?\nACE: Yeah. The white had gone right out of his face when we first arrived there, so I reckon he’1ll be needing a breather before he can whip up a time storm to get himself back.\nDOCTOR: Yes, forcing his essence in and out of the time vortex will take a considerable effort. But then, he is a considerable opponent — so please, Ace, hurry!\nHURMZID: Could we not use my talisman? The hammer?\nACE: The shine’s gone right off it. Guess it must need time to recharge itself, too. (PASSING HAMMER) But here, have it back anyway. Cheers for the borrow.\nDOCTOR: This is hopeless. Much as it pains me — Ace, you’1ll have to use your Nitro Nine.\nACE: On these chains? Well, I could, but I couldn’t guarantee it wouldn’t take your legs off in the process. (FX: UNZIPPING\nRUCKSACK: COMPARTMENT, PRODUCING OBJECT) Alternatively — I could always use this.\nDOCTOR: My molecular phase disruptor! Where did you get that?\nACE: Swiped it out of your toolbox when we landed here. Figured I’d be needing some extra kit. Don’t complain, not unless you want me to stick a Ganymede Driver somewhere painful.

(SARCASTIC) Thanks so much for keeping us in the loop about Private Benjamin, and the sainted Lysandra.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Yes. That.\nACE: Yes. That.\nDOCTOR: Ace. Don’t you see — I was swapping one of my castles for another, to divert my opponent’s attention?\nACE: You could have told us! (BITTER) You just didn’t trust us, that’s all.\nDOCTOR: And if I’d told you I was playing Fenric?\nACE: I’d have killed you. — (FX: SHUTS OFF DISRUPTOR) Still might, if you don’t hold still!\nDOCTOR: Sorry. (FX: DISRUPTOR ON) What I meant was, if I’d told you I was playing Fenric, would you have been able to trust yourself?\nACE: Maybe, maybe not. But it’d have been my call. (QUIET) I’m angrier than I’ve ever been with you, Professor. You can tell by the way I’m not shouting.\nDOCTOR: This is more than a grudge match, Ace. I realised, a long time ago, that something — someone — was stirring up the Elder Gods.\nACE: Yeah, I know. The Karnas’koi? The — what was it? — Mi’en Kalarash? Moloch?\nDOCTOR: You met Moloch?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 53\nACE: Oh, me and Hex had a barrel of laughs, sitting out World War Three with your mates Peggy and Albert.\nDOCTOR: No, it was long before Moloch. The giant chess set, in the Swiss Sanatorium? I knew. So while you and Hex slept —\nACE: . while our backs were turned, you mean —\nDOCTOR: . I followed whispers, traces of the Elder Gods on a thousand worlds, over thousands of years. All of them talking about the same thing: an artefact called Weyland’s Shield.\nACE: Yeah, well — we found it. That’s how we got here. (FX: SHUTS OFF DISRUPTOR) That’s it. All done.\nDOCTOR: (FX: RISING UP, CHAINS FALLING TO FLOOR) Thank you, Ace. Fenric wants that shield. When we cast him back into the outer darkness, it was still as a shapeless spirit. The shield will allow him to reattain his natural form — or so he thinks.\nHURMZID: But what is his natural form, if it is not that of a man?\nDOCTOR: Something with an infinity of limbs, some of which creep across whole other dimensions.\nACE: Think I met a guy like that in a nightclub once.\nDOCTOR: This is no laughing matter, Ace! He’s already quite ridiculously powerful, and should he reattain his natural form — well, there’s no force in the whole of existence that could stop him.\nACE: So what are going to do about it?\nDOCTOR: Stop him.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: EXT.

Fenric whisked them away in a time storm. No idea where they’ve got to.\nDOCTOR: Well, then — where is it? (WORRY) Don’t say with Mr Hex-?\nACE: He’s not completely useless, you know. Hang about — Hurmzid, I left you guarding Hex.\nHURMZID: When you and the other warrior women did not return, he insisted we enter this castle, to look for you.\nACE: I take it all back.\nDOCTOR: Well, where is he now-?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 57\nHEX: (BREATHLESS) Ohh, am I glad to see you!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING FORWARD, WITH OTHERS) Mr Hex.

We’ve run the models. We’ve crunched the numbers. It’s inevitable. Lysandra, we know!\nOLDER ARISTIDES: Don’t you care about that?\nGENERAL MORGAN: How long do you suppose the White Fleet’s been travelling, Lysandra? How many worlds, suns — galaxies, even — do you suppose it’s destroyed? One way or another, the Earth is finished. But by using the Higgs Killer, the human race gets to do the universe a favour.\nSALLY: Captain? Is this true?\nARISTIDES: Pretty much.\nGENERAL MORGAN: The delivery system is here, on the roof. All we need is the last part of the cipher, to unscramble the electron lock that Nimrod placed on the technology. Then, bang, the White Fleet’s gone. And the four and half billion years that the Earth’s been around might have actually meant something.\nOLDER ARISTIDES: (TO LIEUTENANT) Turn that thing off, will you?!

It’s down to you and me.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 69\nOLDER ARISTIDES: But I don’t have that passcode, Sally. Really, I don’t.\nGENERAL MORGAN: You led Nimrod’s escort at CERN, when he carried out a dummy run for the Killer beam.

Littered with the corpses of Saxons and Vikings. I wonder why...?\nACE: The Vikings, that’s easy enough. They’re Fenric’s fan club.\nHURMZID: His what?\nACE: I once spent all night on a pavement with my mate Lauren, just to see Johnny Hates Jazz leave their hotel and get in a cab.\nHURMZID: You are not making sense.\nACE: You’re telling me.\nHEX: Doctor? Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: No, Mr Hex. I’m very far from alright. Think about it, all of you. Those Saxons, why are they even here?\nACE: Er, fighting the Vikings?\nDOCTOR: Yes, attacking Fenric’s Wolves, or those Fenric has turned into Haemovores. But why? On whose behalf?\nHURMZID: Well, his opponent’s.\nHEX: (UNCERTAIN) Yours-—-?\nDOCTOR: Sending all these men to die on my behalf? Does that really sound like something I’d want to be a part of?\nACE: Who is it, then, who’s doing this? Professor? Do you know?\nDOCTOR: I have a certain grave suspicion.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 72\nHEX: Er, what with all your pontificating, there was something we all failed to notice...?\nHURMZID: The mist has fallen! The monsters are coming again!\nANCIENT ONE: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Stop. You must... stop.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) That’s the Ancient One.\nACE: Looks different from last time.\nDOCTOR: He is different. I wonder what he wants...?\nHEX: What, we’re actually waiting to find out?\nHURMZID: My friends, I wish you all the best. But if the monsters are here, then my father is unguarded. My talisman, its shine has recovered. And so —\nACE: Mate, you’re not running out on us?!?\nHURMZID: I am sorry. (FX: STRIKES HAMMER ON GROUND, AS IN SCENE 19) Take me to my father.

I’m staying here.\nSALLY: (LOST) But.. why’s she just sat there? It’s obvious!

This must be important!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 80\nPEGGY: (A FEW FEET AWAY) It’s Sally, isn’t it? Sally Morgan? (TO ARISTIDES) And you —by the sour expression you must be Lysandra Aristides...?\nARISTIDES: (TO SELF) Not a civilian. So: fair game.\nSALLY: Captain, no-!\nSALLY: (FX: AND FIRES OFF A SHOT FROM ALIEN GUN — BER-WHUMP — INTO THE GROUND AT PEGGY'S FEET)\nPEGGY: Careful where you’re shooting, dear. This is ancient ground.\nARISTIDES: Warning shot. Who are you, and what do you want?\nPEGGY: Don’t get so agitated. My name’s Peggy, and I wondered — would either of you like a nice cup of tea?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: EXT. PLAIN\nANCIENT ONE: The deaths of many thousands stain my soul. As the Romans suffered, so must I suffer. And learn what it is to lose a son.\nHEX: No! Noll!\nHEX: (SCRAMBLING OVER) He’s dead.\nANCIENT ONE: I feel... no different. Is this my damnation?\nHEX: What did you have to do that for, you monster?!\nDOCTOR: Leave him, Hex.\nANCIENT ONE: (NOTICING HEX FOR THE FIRST TIME) “Hex”. Strange, I have not seen you before. You are... injured.\nHEX: I’m fine!\nDOCTOR: No. You’re bleeding. Your shoulder, it’s bleeding.\nHEX: (LOOKS) What? — (WINCES) Oh, man! How the hell did that happen?\nDOCTOR: Sit down, Mr Hex. Let me see. (BEAT) Oh dear.\nHEX: Yeah, me clavipectoral fascia. Right where that nutter Barty Kitchen shot me, back in Scutari. (WINCES) Careful!\nDOCTOR: sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 82\nHEX: I don’t get it, I didn’t hear a shot.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t a wound in the same place, Mr Hex. It’s the same wound.\nHEX: What-?\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) How long have we all been playing this game, I wonder?\nHEX: A bleeding man, on a planet of vampires. Couldn’t have planned this better, could I?\nACE: (SOME WAY OFF) Had enough, nasty, or do you want some more?!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I think Ace has the Haemovores under control.\nANCIENT ONE: The game has changed. I must recall these creatures, and depart.\nHEX: Go on, then. Don’t hang about.\nANCIENT ONE: There is indeed a powerful curse on you, “Hex”. (FX: SOUND LIKE A\nGIANT: CLAM OPENING) Please. You must... take this.\nHEX: I’m taking nothing off you.\nANCIENT ONE: It is a part of my bio-armour. You are wounded. It will... protect you.\nHEX: Thanks all the same, but I think I’1ll pass right now. Besides, it’s a bit slimy, like.\nDOCTOR: Put it on, Hex.\nHEX: Seriously?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: The wound is worse than it looks. The armour will help.\nHEX: You say so — (FX: SLURP AS ARMOUR MOULDS AROUND HEX’S SHOULDER) Aah! Oh!\nDOCTOR: Better?\nHEX: (SURPRISED) Yeah, that is — yeah!\nANCIENT ONE: (TO HAEMOVORES) Return to me, you senseless things. Return.\nACE: (RETURNING) Aww, where are you going? The party’s hardly started!\nDOCTOR: Going back to your master, Ancient One?\nANCIENT ONE: (DEPARTING) The shield remains intact. There is.. all to play for, still.\nDOCTOR: (CRYPTICALLY) The mist is lifting.\nHEX: Yeah, well — I’m none the wiser. Why’d he help me? Doctor?\nACE: (SCRAMBLING OVER) What’s up? Why’d they retreat? (SEEING HEX) And what is that thing on your shoulder, Hex?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. WEYLAND’S SMITHY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ENCLOSED, SMALL FIRE. VERY DISTANT SOUNDS OF FOUNDRY, OFF —\nCLANKING: HAMMERS, STEAM)\nPEGGY: (ENTERING) In, dears, in! There’s more room than it looks.\nSALLY: (ENTERING) But — this isn’t right.\nARISTIDES: How d’you mean, Private?\nSALLY: Weyland’s Smithy is a Neolithic burial mound. It isn’t occupied.\nPEGGY: It’s just a stove, and a few chairs. It was good enough for old Weyland. They called him the blacksmith of the gods, you know. —\nARISTIDES: We know. (CROSSING ROOM) What’s through here? Sounds mechanical —\nPEGGY: Pipes, that’s all. Just pipes. (FX: COPPER KETTLE ON STOVE) Teas all round, is it? I’1l warm the pot. —\nARISTIDES: You knew our names. ‘Peggy’. How come you knew our names?\nPEGGY: I know lots of names, dear. Our old friend Fenric — he made an illegal move, showing you your possible futures. I was sent to — well, put that right, I suppose.\nSALLY: Yes, but — [how?]\nPEGGY: I can’t rightly say, Private Morgan. Did no-one ever tell you, two wrongs don’t make a right?\nARISTIDES: You're playing the same game, aren’t you? The Doctor’s game.\nPEGGY: ‘The Doctor’. Oh yes. Me and my Albert, we so enjoyed playing the Doctor. But that was all such a long time ago. Now, what’s missing? I know. Biscuits!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. PLAIN\nDOCTOR: Now, what’s missing?\nHEX: Er — Sal, and Lysandra?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We need them back from — well, wherever they’ve got to. Ace?\nACE: Don’t look at me, I don’t know where Fenric whooshed them away to. All he said was something about a maiden, a wife and a hag. And ‘the chaos to come’.\nHEX: Is that all?\nACE: Oh yeah, and the deaths of everyone on the planet Earth.\nHEX: Do what?\nACE: Slipped my mind, that bit. Doesn’t narrow down their location any, though —\nDOCTOR: No, but I know what might.\nACE: Hurmzid’s hammer! Of course!\nDOCTOR: (PICKING UP HAMMER) His ‘talisman’, yes. This will take us straight to wherever they are, assuming —\nACE: Yeah, assuming it’s not a trap, and Fenric’s not waiting. (SNATCHING HAMMER OFF HIM) Give me that, Professor-!\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Ace...!\nACE: Look, I’1l be dead quick. I won’t even stop to blow anything up. Promise.\nHEX: Seriously?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 86\nACE: Fingers crossed, fooled you. (FX: STRIKES HAMMER ON GROUND, AS BEFORE) Take me to Sally Morgan and Lysandra Aristides. (FX: TIME\nSTORM: WHIPPING UP) (FADING) Smoke me a kipper, I’1l be back for [breakfast]\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT. WEYLAND’S SMITHY\nPEGGY: Tea’s up. How’d you like it, my loves?\nSALLY: Strong and sweet, please.\nPEGGY: (DISTASTE) Army tea, of course. Don’t mind mugs, do you? (FX:\nPOURING TEA THROUGH: ) My Albert always preferred mugs. Me, I like a nice piece of proper china. —\nARISTIDES: We don’t care about the china! Peggy — whoever you are — your little old lady act is trying my patience.\nSALLY: Captain —\nPEGGY: Now, now, dear — don’t trouble yourself on my behalf. The sour- faced Captain is quite right. I’m no more a little old lady than this is a Neolithic barrow. I am old, though.\nARISTIDES: How old?\nPEGGY: (DARK) Older than you could possibly imagine. (BRIGHT) Drink up.\nARISTIDES: (GETTING UP) That’s it, I’ve had enough. Come on, Morgan.\nSALLY: (FOLLOWING) But — where are we going?\nARISTIDES: (FX: OPENING WOODEN DOOR) The M4, then Swindon, then a direct train to London.\nPEGGY: (SITTING, OFF) Good luck with that, dears.\nSALLY: What do you mean?\nARISTIDES: Come on, Morgan. — (FX: THEY WALK OUT INTO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: EXT. BATTLEFIELD [CONTINUOUS]\nSALLY: OK, the M4 should be just over — (BREAKS OFF) Oh my [God.]\nARISTIDES: Yes, somehow I don’t think we’re in the West Country anymore.\nSALLY: Red skies. We’re back on Fenric’s world!\nPEGGY: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Not Fenric’s world, dear. This is just — the board.\nSALLY: A flat board.\nARISTIDES: We were on Earth, and then —\nPEGGY: And then Black moved his castle. The game goes on, dear. (FX:\nTIME: STORM WHIPPING UP, OFF) Ah! And here’s someone making a move now.\nSALLY: A time storm!\nARISTIDES: Must be Fenric.\nPEGGY: Oh no. I do believe it’s —\nACE: (MATERIALISED) Phew! Well, at least it’s not Perivale.\nSALLY: Ace!\nACE: Private Benjamin. It’s just you and Lysandra, I — [hope]\nPEGGY: Coo-ee! Hello there, Ace, dear. Remember me-?\nACE: Oh, what?!?\nSALLY: You know her?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 89\nACE: Hex and me, we went through World War Three because of her and her Albert. Don’t let the little old lady thing fool you, she’s —\nARISTIDES: Something else. We’re not stupid, McShane.\nACE: She’s an alien god. (POINTEDLY) A minor one.\nPEGGY: Mind you don’t cut yourself on that tongue of yours.\nACE: Alright, where is he?\nSALLY: Her ‘Albert’, you mean?\nACE: Moloch. Her boss.\nPEGGY: There’s more than one game being played here, dear.\nARISTIDES: What exactly do you mean by that?\nPEGGY: Look around you, Lysandra Aristides. Over there. — And there. — Oh, and there, too. —\nACE: More bodies.\nARISTIDES: Who are they? Saxons? Vikings?\nPEGGY: All sorts, dear. Someone’s been bringing whole armies here, to fight Fenric. Gathering them up from all over the place. All different times and places.\nARISTIDES: Yes, but who-?\nPEGGY: Well, it’s got to be someone who’s got an old score to settle with Fenric. Someone with the means to move people about in time and space, and charismatic enough to talk them into fighting and dying on his behalf. Now, who do you think that sounds like?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. PLAIN\nHEX: What’s keeping Ace?\nDOCTOR: The hammer will need time to recharge.\nHEX: What, so she’1ll be coming the long way round?\nHEX: (FX: LOW RUMBLE OF ‘THUNDER’ — ACTUALLY ONE OF SEVERAL ELDER GODS MATERIALISING IN THE SKY, BROUGHT BY A TIME STORM, BUT IT’LL\nSOUND: LIKE DISTANT THUNDER HERE)\nDOCTOR: Something in the air. A storm on the way. Come along, Mr Hex. We'll be needing that shield.\nHEX: Oh, right. (HEFTING SHIELD) Well, where are going?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS.\nHEX: Yeah, like Fenric’s really going to let you quit this game of yours before it’s finished.\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose he will. But a Time Lord’s TARDIS is his castle.\nHEX: Chess again. So you’re making a play?\nDOCTOR: No. But I’d like to see the board from another perspective.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. FENRIC’S KEEP — HALL\nFENRIC: (MURMURED) Ancient One. Come to me.\nANCIENT ONE: My master. You have... returned.\nFENRIC: Returned, yes, to find the Doctor gone!\nANCIENT ONE: It was the woman. “Ace”. She had... great faith.\nFENRIC: So, my opponent has had a free hand, in my absence. But I see from the board that there are few plays left open to him. There, by his castle, the Queen that thinks she’s a Knight, the Knight that thinks she’s a Bishop... and, yes, a pawn broken free from the [front rank] — (BREAKS OFF)\nANCIENT ONE: Master? What troubles you?\nFENRIC: The board is not as it was. One of Black’s pawns has been taken! The Prince of Persia, I believe...?\nANCIENT ONE: Once, he was my son.\nFENRIC: And?\nANCIENT ONE: The ties between a father and his son are not easily severed.\nFENRIC: I would not know. I have no children. Only wolves.\nANCIENT ONE: With his death, I believed that I would be absolved of my sins. But I am as cursed as I ever was.\nFENRIC: So, you presumed to play my hand for me, Ancient One?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 92\nANCIENT ONE: I would weep, had I tear ducts in this corruption of a body.\nFENRIC: Pity yourself all you like. The game has no pity. (DECISIVELY) Summon the Haemovores. I will need more pawns to sacrifice. Perhaps I will sacrifice you too, my last Bishop. If you’re good.\nANCIENT ONE: Then... the game nears its end?\nFENRIC: One piece is shielded from me still. But I see now that it can only be hidden behind another. (FX: MOVING CHESSPIECE) White rook to E7!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: EXT. PLAIN — BY STREAM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: STREAM OFF. MORE LOW ‘THUNDER’ ... DISGUISING THE GRINDING ‘CHUDD!’ OF FENRIC’S CASTLE MOVING INTO POSITION, OFF)\nHEX: (FX: WALKING WITH DOCTOR) More thunder.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) If that’s what it is. What a time to be caught without an umbrella. I left a lovely one on the bridge at Arnhem. A black Fulton minister. I couldn’t go back for it, the Germans had us hemmed in on three [sides. ]\nHEX: (FX: WALKING INTO STREAM — SPLASHING) Oh, man! Gonna be the death of me trainers. — (REALISATION) Hang about, this is the stream we\nHEX: followed before.\nDOCTOR: Then the TARDIS is close by?\nHEX: (SCRAMBLING FORWARD) Just over this ridge, I think — (AT TOP) Oh hell.\nDOCTOR: (FOLLOWING) What is it? Let me see. — Ah.\nHEX: There’s the TARDIS alright. But look what’s beside it!\nDOCTOR: Yes, Fenric has moved his castle.\nFENRIC: (CALLING, WELL OFF) Doctor! Where are you...? Doctor!!!\nHEX: Oh, and there he is. The original green-eyed monster.\nDOCTOR: (DECISIVELY) Wait here, Mr Hex.\nHEX: You’re not gonna go to him-?!\nDOCTOR: (MOVING OFF) Stay out of sight. Protect the shield.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 94\nFENRIC: (CALLING YOU) I know you’re close by, Doctor. I’m the big bad wolf, I can smell you...!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Very clever, Fenric, the way you move your pieces around the board.\nFENRIC: It’s easy enough. All the matter, all the mass of the universe to come is mine to command here.\nDOCTOR: Like tins on a supermarket shelf. Moving fresh food to the back so the older items can be sold first.\nFENRIC: If you must. So: how would you like me to kill you, Time Lord? Painfully, over centuries? Or painfully, over aeons? Perhaps I should make you watch as I torture your friends to death. Or perhaps I should make them torture each other? What do you think?\nDOCTOR: For all your huffing and puffing, Fenric, you’re just a boy who likes pulling the wings off spiders, aren’t you?\nFENRIC: The wings off — [spiders?!?] Oh, that’s very you, Doctor. Just like the good old days. Or should I say — good Old Times?\nDOCTOR: I’ve had enough of this, Fenric.\nFENRIC: No you haven’t. You revel in the game as much as I do. But it’s over now. Show me the shield.\nDOCTOR: I don’t have it.\nFENRIC: I can sense it, almost. At the edge of my perception. Out of the corner of my eye. Is it in your TARDIS? .. No. No, it isn’t. Where is it..? Where have you hidden it...?\nDOCTOR: (BLUFFING) You’ve moved your pieces. I’ve moved mine.\nFENRIC: You exaggerate your importance. Time Lord.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FEROCIOUS RUMBLE OF ‘THUNDER’ — ACTUALLY ANOTHER ELDER GOD MATERIALISING IN THE SKY)\nDOCTOR: That’s no ordinary thunder. What is that?\nFENRIC: Look up, Doctor. Up into the broiling cosmos.\nDOCTOR: Shapes in the clouds. (CALLING) The Elder Gods, I presume? Gathering for the endgame? (TO FENRIC) I should have known this was a spectator sport.\nFENRIC: They know you, Time Lord. They’ve enjoyed your antics. Rushing around the bullring of the universe, like some funny little matador. But they always knew — one day you’d over-reach yourself. One day, the bull would run you through. And now, at last, that day has come!\nDOCTOR: No!\nFENRIC: You have lost. Time Lord. (CALLING) Rise up, my wolves! (FX:\nHAEMOVORE: MOANING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS — A MASS OF CREATURES EMERGING FROM ALL AROUND. SOME BREAKING THE SOIL, LIKE ZOMBIES) Rise up from the mists, and the soil! Sweep the Doctor and his friends from the board!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: EXT. BATTLEFIELD\nSALLY: What is that?\nARISTIDES: Just thunder.\nPEGGY: Oh no. Not thunder, my pet. That’s the Old Gods gathering. The game must be nearing its end.\nACE: That can’t be good.\nPEGGY: Fenric will be making his play. Bringing his legions forward.\nACE: Legions-?\nARISTIDES: So what are you saying? There’s a big push coming-?\nSALLY: Captain, we should get under cover. Defend our position.\nARISTIDES: You’re right. Morgan, McShane — back to the Smithy!\nPEGGY: The Smithy, dear? The Smithy’s gone.\nARISTIDES: Gone? But it was just [here —]\nPEGGY: Well, it’s not there now. (TEASING) Perhaps someone’s moved it?\nARISTIDES: ‘Someone’? Who?\nSALLY: The Doctor?\nACE: She’s winding you up. It isn’t him. It can’t be.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 97\nPEGGY: Would you care to test that, Ace? Place your faith in him, to repel the hordes of Fenric’s wolves?\nARISTIDES: Oh, so it’s ‘hordes’ now.\nSALLY: Captain? What do we do?\nPEGGY: If I were you, dear — I’d dig out what you can. There’s weapons all over the battlefield, if you look. Bits and bobs left here for the armies sent to fight Fenric.\nACE: Saxon armies-?\nPEGGY: Saxon armies. Roman armies. All sorts of armies.\nARISTIDES: These Elder Gods. What’s wrong with a plain old-fashioned chessboard?\nACE: Back in Perivale, I had this mate, Midge. Got into ‘Dungeons & Dragons’ one summer, spent all his time indoors painting up little lead orcs and goblins. Thing was, you didn’t need the little lead figures to play the game. He just reckoned they made it more realistic.\nPEGGY: (FX: DIGGING IN MUD, WITH FINGERS) Go on. Have a good root about, all of you. (FX: SLOOP AS SHE PRODUCES SOMETHING FROM THE MUD) Look, here’s something!\nACE: What is it?\nPEGGY: A null field anti-cannon. It might look like a glittery tube with a wind chime for sights, but actually —\nACE: Gordon Bennett!\nSALLY: (ASIDE) Captain — are we missing something here?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 98\nARISTIDES: Like what?\nSALLY: Roman armies? With alien guns?\nARISTIDES: Your point being...?\nSALLY: Who made all these weapons? What for?\nARISTIDES: You heard the old woman. To fight Fenric. And that’s what we’re doing. Fighting Fenric.\nSALLY: I know. It’s just — I think someone else is, too.\nACE: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Oi! Why don’t you stop gossiping, you two, and start getting your hands dirty?!\nPEGGY: (FURTHER OFF STILL) Look, there’s all sorts over here! .. Mind the landmines, though. Beastly things, they should be banned.\nARISTIDES: You heard them, Morgan.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: EXT.

Shouldn’t you know that by now?\nHEX: (OFF) Doctor! Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: I told you — stay back!\nHEX: (OFF) There’s more of them this way, coming up from the water!\nDOCTOR: Try not to panic!\nFENRIC: Who are you talking to? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No-one! Myself!\nFENRIC: . The shield, of course. It’s there with you, isn’t it? I can’t see it, that’s all.\nHEX: (WITH THE DOCTOR) Doctor, do something!\nDOCTOR: Any second now, Hex. I think. (UNCERTAIN) I hope.\nFENRIC: Eh? Your TARDIS, Time Lord. It just —\nDOCTOR: (BLUFFING) Just, er, moving one of the tins around the supermarket shelf?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 100\nHEX: (TO DOCTOR) How’d you do that?\nFENRIC: You cannot! You do not have the power! .. Oh, but this is not your play, is it?\nDOCTOR: (FX: KEY IN DOOR, OPENS) Into the TARDIS, Hex! Hurry!\nHEX: (ENTERING) You don’t have to tell me —\nFENRIC: You know what this means, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Make your play, Fenric. If you have one.\nFENRIC: Your castle is not your own, Time Lord!

Thought he was gonna explode with — (DOUBLE TAKE) You didn’t?\nDOCTOR: Any more than I set its next destination.\nHEX: Doctor, you’re scaring me. Actually scaring me.\nDOCTOR: All this time I thought I was playing Fenric at some vast game of chess, played out on a cosmic level. I thought I was the black king, and he was the white.\nHEX: You were Black-? But Black’s — [evil]\nDOCTOR: Mr Hex. Try looking beyond your literal ideas about good and evil!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: EXT.

TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nHEX: I don’t get this. Any of this.\nDOCTOR: In my arrogance, I believed myself to be Fenric’s opposite. His equal. But all this time, I’ve been just another piece on the board. Played for a fool.\nHEX: By Fenric?\nDOCTOR: By his opponent. (FX: TIME ROTOR GRINDS TO A HALT) We’ve arrived.

I was expecting — I dunno, a dungeon or something.\nDOCTOR: We’re on the Ridgeway Path. An ancient route through the west of England. Early in the Middle Ages, I'd say.\nHEX: Pretty. (SPOTTING SOMETHING ON THE DISTANCE) Hey, on the far hill. One of those big chalk horses.\nDOCTOR: A white knight, watching over the enemy camp.\nHEX: You what?\nDOCTOR: Everything’s symbolic.\nHEX: Hang about — what’s that sound? —\nDOCTOR: To your left, Mr Hex. Follow me.\nHEX: Oh. Yeah. There’s smoke, coming out of that — I dunno, cave?\nDOCTOR: It’s a dolmen, a Neolithic burial site. Legend calls it Weyland’s Smithy.\nHEX: Weyland? Like Weyland’s Shield?\nDOCTOR: Weyland was the blacksmith of the gods. They say that if your horse needed shoeing, you could tie it here, and bury a coin, and the job would be done by the morning. (FX: THEY STOP) (CALLING) Hello? Anyone home?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 105\nWEYLAND: (SLIGHTLY OFF) (GRUFF) Do you something, stranger?\nHEX: (TO DOCTOR) That’s a relief, it’s just a man. I was expecting a monster or something.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING WEYLAND) We’ve not met. But we’re not strangers, I think.\nWEYLAND: Didn’t hear you arrive. Been busy, at my forge.\nHEX: His what?\nDOCTOR: Hex, may I introduce Weyland, a blacksmith. (DARK) The. Black. Smith.\nHEX: (REALISATION) Oh no.\nWEYLAND: Everything’s symbolic. “Hex”.\nDOCTOR: Weyland — or Volund, in the original Norse. Fenric’s opponent. A maker of weapons. Tools for gods to fight other gods.\nHEX: The man who made the shield!\nWEYLAND: “Man”, you say. (FX: PIERCING THROB AS WEYLAND BEGINS TO MANIFEST HIMSELF IN HIS NATURAL FORM, THROUGH:) (EFFORT) Little mortal, I\nWEYLAND: am so much more than a man.\nHEX: What’s he doing?

Poor loves, they’re exhausting themselves.\nARISTIDES: They’re getting tired-?\nPEGGY: You try keeping an army of zombies going with only the power of you mind, dear. Anyone would get tired, even Elder Gods.\nARISTIDES: Then this is as good a chance as we’re going to get. Morgan — you see that ridge, over to the East? Cover me.\nSALLY: But that’s right through the Haemovores!\nARISTIDES: We’re getting nowhere stuck in this foxhole. If we can secure that position, we’ve half a chance of taking a shot or two at Fenric himself.\nPEGGY: Well, yes.

Me and the Captain, Fenric showed us — took us — into the future. Our future. I was a General.\nPEGGY: Congratulations, dear.\nDOCTOR: Quiet, you. (TO SALLY) You were a General, and —\nSALLY: I destroyed the world, Doctor. I killed the Higgs Boson. Everything just.. came apart. Was it.. was it a trick?\nDOCTOR: Let’s worry more about our immediate future, Sally Morgan.\nSALLY: You mean — it wasn’t a trick?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 122\nPEGGY: Course it wasn’t. You, me, the Captain, your friend Hex — we’re Volund’s. We’re his pawns, all of us. Always have been—\nSALLY: I don’t understand —\nPEGGY: Fenric, he wanted to turn your heads. Turn Volund’s pawns against him.\nDOCTOR: Sally, you’re nobody’s pawn.\nPEGGY: Oh no? All of you, you’re still moving against Fenric. Playing Black’s game for him. (BEAT; ANNOYED) Well, aren’t you?\nARISTIDES: (COMING OVER) And what about you, ‘Peggy’? Why are you on Weyland’s side?\nPEGGY: ‘Cos Volund’s got my Albert, hasn’t he? Moloch rescued the pair of us from the Doctor’s trap, only it turned out Moloch was betting on Volund’s side. The great horror’s somewhere up above us now, enjoying the game. Any road up — Volund wanted one of us in the field, working for him, ‘cos we knew the Doctor, see?\nDOCTOR: So Albert’s his hostage.\nPEGGY: I does miss him so. But soon it’ll be time to get him back, like Volund promised.\nDOCTOR: Like I told my old friend Hurmzid — never make deals with demons.\nPEGGY: What d’you mean? Volund’1l come good on his promise.

Hex?\nHEX: (UN-POSSESSED) I feel awful.\nACE: Yeah, you’re bleeding.\nHEX: What? — Oh, man. Me shoulder. Again.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the Ancient One’s bio-armour has disintegrated.\nHEX: Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR: Because the Ancient One has died, I suspect.\nSALLY: (FIDDLING IN POCKETS) Hold on, I’ve got a compress. —\nHEX: (WINCING) Ow! Sal-!\nSALLY: Just hold still. Big baby.\nACE: Hex, mate. That wound, that’s where —\nHEX: Yeah, I know.\nACE: What the hell is going on?\nPEGGY: Yes, dear. Hell is going on. And on. And on.\nDOCTOR: Weyland saved Hex’s life, back in Scutari, so he could use him, like he’s used all of us. I thought I was playing Fenric for the fate of the cosmos. But I’m just another piece on the board. And not even an important one. All I had to do was bring Hex here.\nHEX: It was always gonna end this way, Doctor. “Hex”. Even me name means “Cursed”.\nSALLY: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: He’s Weyland’s secret weapon. Invisible to Fenric, brought here under the smokescreen of all my plans and plots and scheming.\nACE: Invisible?\nHEX: The Haemovores couldn’t see me, remember?\nDOCTOR: The shield. It’s something to do with the shield.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 127\nARISTIDES: I know what it is. I remember. Morgan, look-! If I invert the shield...!\nSALLY: It’s still just a shield — (REALISATION) Oh, no.\nARISTIDES: It’s a dish. A bit like a radio telescope?\nACE: What are you two witches on about-?\nSALLY: Fenric showed us our futures. There’s a base, at Uffington Camp. That’s what I used — will use — to destroy the world. Well, a giant version of it.\nARISTIDES: Powered by the same boss, see?\nDOCTOR: The boss from the Forge.\nARISTIDES: It’s an anti-mass accelerator. It kills the Higgs Boson.\nDOCTOR: I think I’m beginning to understand.\nACE: Go on, then. Amaze us.\nDOCTOR: The shield’s not a defence, but a weapon. It removes mass from the universe. The person who wields it can reshape... everything. Everything that ever was, everything that ever will be.\nACE: Yeah, and it makes you invisible.\nDOCTOR: It sucks mass from the wearer.\nHEX: That’1ll be why the Haemovores couldn’t see me, eh? Why I couldn’t use any of those guns?\nDOCTOR: Weyland made it, manufactured it. Such power would set him up above the gods. Above all of the gods.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 128\nPEGGY: So Fenric challenged him for it. A supremely powerful weapon. (BITTER) And Volund gave it to you... feeble children.\nDOCTOR: The gods can’t interfere directly in the workings of our mortal realm. It’s not good sport.\nSALLY: Weyland was using us to unleash its energies. Me, you, the Captain...\nARISTIDES: And Nimrod. Don’t forget Nimrod.\nDOCTOR: But that was all in a future that didn’t happen. Because the shield never ended up in Nimrod’s hands, did it?\nARISTIDES: . because we took it away, back in Beowulf’s time. We brought the shield here!\nDOCTOR: And threw the game into disarray. Ironic — Fenric possessed the shield’s owner, but he couldn’t possess the shield.\nHEX: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because, for now, only Weyland’s pieces can see it, let alone take it. Fenric can only take it if he wins.\nSALLY: Then... Fenric was playing with us, by showing us that future?\nDOCTOR: I imagine he wanted to turn you against Weyland, so that Weyland would lose and deliver him the shield.\nACE: Hang about. If Weyland wants to destroy the universe, and Fenric is fighting hin...\nPEGGY: Yes, what does that make you, dears? The goodies, or the baddies?\nPEGGY: ACE/SALLY/DOCTOR: Whoa! /Urgh!/Oof!\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 129\nARISTIDES: (DROPPING SHIELD) The shield-!\nHEX: What was that...?\nWEYLAND: (FROM OUTSIDE) Hex! Hex! Treacherous cur, you have a mission to perform! (EFFORT — SHOVING TANK AGAIN)\nACE: Weyland.\nSALLY: Yes, but he’s weakened. The battle’s taken it out of him.\nPEGGY: Exactly, dear. Weakened. Which means — this is my chance. (FX:\nGRABBING: SHIELD — SCRAPE) I’1l just take this, shall I..?

You have the shield.\nPEGGY: (FX: JUMPING TO GROUND) Yes, and I’1ll use it, too, if you don’t return to me what’s mine. My reward, for serving you!\nWEYLAND: (BAFFLED) Reward...?\nPEGGY: My Albert! (DARK) Under the rituals and oaths that bind us, I demand of thee, Volund — restore my soul-bonded mate to me.\nDOCTOR: (AT HATCH) Peggy! Don’t do this!\nACE: (AT HATCH) What’s she playing at-?\nPEGGY: (TO WEYLAND) Return my Albert! Or I’1ll give the shield to old Fenric. I could do that, couldn’t I?\nWEYLAND: But — (FX: GLITTERY SOUND, A PAWN MATERIALISING OUT OF THE AIR) I have him here. Here in my hand. “Peggy.”\nPEGGY: That’s a pawn. Spare us your symbolism, Volund! Give me my Albert!\nWEYLAND: More than a symbol. An avatar. Like all pawns, he was made to be sacrificed. (FX: SNAPS HEAD OFF PAWN)\nPEGGY: No!!!\nWEYLAND: You would dare move against me? Well, there is your reward.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 131\nACE: He just snapped the pawn’s head off. Does that mean-?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’m afraid it does.\nPEGGY: (TEARFUL) I curse you, Volund! I curse you, and will be revenged on you! I use the shield! Use your own weapon against you!\nACE: Look, he’s got another pawn!\nDOCTOR: Peggy, no!\nWEYLAND: End this futile argument. (FX: SNAPS HEAD OFF PAWN)\nPEGGY: N— (CUT SUDDENLY SHORT) (FX: BODY FALLS TO GROUND; SHIELD ROLLS AWAY, CLATTERS )\nACE: That’s horrible.\nWEYLAND: Even elder gods may die.\nDOCTOR: (FX: JUMPING TO GROUND) We know everything, Volund. Everything you’ve been planning.\nWEYLAND: The game is set, Time Lord. There’s but one last move to play. (CALLING) Hex...!\nHEX: (AT HATCH) It’s alright. I’m coming.\nACE: Hex, I won’t let you. —\nHEX: (CLAMBERING OUT) Get off me, Ace. I know what I’m doing.\nWEYLAND: That’s right. What you were made to do, Hex.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 132\nSALLY: (AT HATCH) Hex! Stop! You weren’t “made” to do anything!\nHEX: (FX: JUMPING TO GROUND) You reckon?\nWEYLAND: Sally Morgan. My most perfect creation. My invisible hand, on Earth, in the future. Invisible.. like she always feared.\nSALLY: (CLAMBERING OUT) What — what do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Your phobia. That you couldn’t be seen? A premonition, of the shield’s effect.\nSALLY: (FX: SHOULDERING GUN) I’11 kill him-!\nHEX: (WALKING FORWARD) Save it, Sal. The game’s as good as over. (FX:\nPICKING: UP SHIELD) Fact is, it was always gonna end this way. —\nWEYLAND: That’s right. Take my shield.\nDOCTOR: Hex, you don’t have to do this.\nHEX: I’m ready. I’m ready now.\nACE: (FX: JUMPING DOWN) Hex, don’t -!\nWEYLAND: (FX: WHIPPING UP TIME STORM) Then come. Meet your destiny.\nHEX: (FX: FADING AWAY, WITH WEYLAND) I’11l see youse guys around, alright?\nACE: He’s gone. (TO DOCTOR) Where’s Weyland taken him-?\nDOCTOR: Where else?

I demand you capitulate!\nFENRIC: (STEPPING FORWARD FROM OFF) Alone, Volund? You come to my castle to confront me — alone?\nHEX: No, not alone. You can’t see me... yeah, but I can see you.\nFENRIC: (OBLIVIOUS) Your armies — devoured. Your pieces — scattered. Your weapons — useless. But still you come to me, in this... weakened state.\nWEYLAND: It’s just you and me, now. This is stalemate. Resign the game, Fenric!\nFENRIC: First surrender the shield.\nWEYLAND: So, still you play on. Still, you seek to be god of gods.\nFENRIC: I bring down fire. I bring down all the fury of the heavens —\nWEYLAND: (FX: STRUCK BY LIGHTNING) Aaaah!\nFENRIC: Mate in two, I think. —\nWEYLAND: (FX: STRUCK BY LIGHTNING AGAIN) Uuh!\nFENRIC: Perhaps even one?

All of the elder gods. They knew you would come for us all, in the end. That’s why they had me make the shield. The ultimate prize. The ultimate... temptation.\nFENRIC: You rabble! (ADDRESSING GODS ABOVE) Yes, you, in the skies! You dared plot against me?\nWEYLAND: (TO HEX) My shield. Have you heard enough? Do you understand, now?\nHEX: I understand alright.\nFENRIC: Who are you talking to? Is someone there...?\nHEX: You gods, you monsters. Playing your games, and to hell with the rest of us.\nWEYLAND: Then end it. End the game, Hex, and I’ll release your friends from hell!\nHEX: Release them? They’1ll never be free of the scars that you put upon them.\nFENRIC: (REALISATION) The shield. It’s here!\nWEYLAND: It was never your prize. It was always your destruction! Read the runes, Hex.

All still fighting against me!\nDOCTOR: Weyland’s gone, Fenric.\nPOSSESSED HEX: I meant — you, Time Lord. They are your creatures. All made by you. I see it, now. It was always you... (GASPS, STAGGERS)\nHEX: (HIS NORMAL SELF) Stick it, Fenric!\nACE: Hex!!!\nHEX: Sorry, flying visit. Can’t hold him back for long. I can feel his doubts clawing away at the back of me mind, trying to get a purchase —\nDOCTOR: Don’t think about that, Mr Hex.\nSALLY: Think about us, here, in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: GODS AND MONSTERS by Mike Maddox (FINAL) Page 142\nACE: The people who, who [love you]\nHEX: Don’t, Ace!
