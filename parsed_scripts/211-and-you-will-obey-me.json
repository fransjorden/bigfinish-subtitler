Well, don’t worry, so am I. Only we’1ll look a bit less conspicuous if we pretend to have a chat while we’re doing it, won’t we?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I suppose we will.

It can’t be.\nDOCTOR: There are other grandfather clocks. Ones that work. (TURNING TO LEAVE) Like I said, I must [be—]\nANNIE: (CUTTING OVER) Are you a Masterson?\nDOCTOR: What?\nANNIE: Are you a relative? A Masterson?\nDOCTOR: Masterson?\nANNIE: Michael Masterson. The man whose house the clock came from? The man who died?\nDOCTOR: Died...?\nANNIE: I can show you, if you like.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 14\nANNIE: He lived in an old farmhands’ cottage, miles from the nearest village. Pretty much derelict, with a wall of brambles all around. The few that even knew about the place say he’d not been seen in twenty, thirty years.\nDOCTOR: This... ‘Michael Masterson’ ?\nANNIE: The woman who runs the post office says her brothers saw him once, one night when they’d missed the last bus into town. They tried to take a shortcut across country, but they got themselves lost.\nANNIE: Only then they saw a light in the distance, coming from the back of the cottage. So they picked their way through the brambles — like barbed wire, they said...\nDOCTOR: Is this a very long story?\nANNIE: Are you in that much of a rush?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. Please, carry on.\nANNIE: All they wanted was to ask directions — and sit out the worst of the rain, maybe. They couldn’t find the door, though, so they banged on the window. Only then there was a flash of lightning, and there was this face in the window. This awful face, all—\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) Burned and blistered.\nANNIE: You did know him!\nDOCTOR: He was handsome, once. Maybe even twice. —aWhat happened then? What did he do?\nDOCTOR WHO: ...AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 15\nANNIE: Well, he told them to leave. Just that: (SCARY VOICE) “Leave.”\nDOCTOR: (MORE TO SELF) Like they had no choice but to obey.\nANNIE: Yes, I suppose. Why would you think that?\nDOCTOR: (POINTING) Church on the left?\nANNIE: Oh, yes! Sorry —\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 16\nENGINE: OFF. BOTH DOORS OPEN.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHUTTING CAR DOOR) I do believe that bell-tower’s Saxon.\nANNIE: (FX: SHUTTING CAR DOOR) I’1l take your word for it.\nANNIE: No need to bother, really. Not out here. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Allow me.\nANNIE: See, you do have manners, after all!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: AMBIENCE. ANNIE LEADING DOCTOR THROUGH LONG GRASS.\nANNIE: It’s this way. Bit off the path, I’m afraid.\nDOCTOR: You’ve visited here already?\nANNIE: I laid flowers. No-one else was going to.\nDOCTOR: I don’t follow.\nANNIE: I’m thinking of buying the cottage, you see. Despite the fire.\nDOCTOR: Fire?\nANNIE: Sorry, I forget, you don’t know any of this. There was a fire at the cottage, a few weeks back. That’s when they found the body. And the clock, of course. The whole place was burned out, pretty much, except for the clock.\nDOCTOR: I see. And...?\nANNIE: .Nand, they traced the landowner, and found his grandson. He didn’t know the first thing about the old house. The grandfather went gaga ages ago, but it turned out the rent had been paid into his account, regular as anything, every month for more than thirty years.\nDOCTOR: By “Michael Masterson”.\nANNIE: The perfect tenant. — That’s the thing, you weren’t even surprised!\nDOCTOR: About the rent?\nANNIE: About the clock! About it being the only thing to survive the blaze?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR: No. (STOPPING) The grave there. That’s new.\nANNIE: Yes, that’s it.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP, READING) “Michael Masterson. Died 2016.”\nANNIE: Not much of an epitaph, but no-one knew what to say. They couldn’t find a date of birth in parish records. Or anything, actually. The pathologist seemed to think the bones were those of a man in late middle-age, but his report was more than a little vague.\nDOCTOR: Should have tried carbon dating. (TO GRAVE) Is it you in there? Really you? What happened? Why were you stuck here? What went wrong...?\nANNIE: I feel like I’m intruding. Look — I don’t mind waiting at the car. I mean, not forever, [but]\nDOCTOR: No, no, it’s not like that. But you might not want to stay. (WALKING OFF) I wonder...?\nANNIE: Why? — Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Ah! Shovel. (RETURNING) That’s handy.\nANNIE: I expect they use it to dig graves, seeing as this is a— (TRAILS OFF; REALISATION) You’re not about to do what I think you’re about to do?\nDOCTOR: That’s why I thought you might not want to stay. (HEFTS SPADE)\nANNIE: But you can’t—!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Annie. But I have to know for sure that it’s him in there. You do understand.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 19\nANNIE: You can’t just go around exhuming bodies without permission!\nDOCTOR: Not without the permission of family or friends, no. In this instance, I suspect I’m closer to either than anyone else on this planet. (HEFTS SPADE AGAIN) Now —\nANNIE: No, wait. Wait! — Look. The turf here.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) It’s been cut. The ground’s been disturbed.\nANNIE: That wasn’t how it was when I was last here. And the flowers I left — you’d think they’d still be here, he can’t have had that many visitors!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: ANNIE. SOFTLY BUZZING VOICES. FLUTTERING, HOVERING WINGS.\nJADE NYMPH: What are these creatures, Dragonmaster? What might they want with the grave?\nGOMPHUS: Watch on, my novice. The true hunter bides their time, then picks their moment to strike.\nJADE: NYMPH & GOMPHUS:\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 21\nANNIE: Wait, did you—?\nDOCTOR: Annie?\nANNIE: Nothing. I thought I heard something. — Doctor. You’re not really going to dig him up, are you?\nDOCTOR: (SETTING SHOVEL DOWN) No point now. The ground’s been disturbed. Whoever was inside there has gone.\nANNIE: What — you think grave-robbers have been at it?\nDOCTOR: In this day and age? Please, let’s be rational about this. No, more likely he simply crawled out of his coffin, then tidied the ground to conceal the fact of his regeneration.\nANNIE: What...?\nDOCTOR: The Master is still alive!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL)\nJADE: NYMPH & GOMPHUS:\nJADE NYMPH: ‘Still... alive!’ He knows, Dragonmaster! He... knows\nGOMPHUS: The creatures depart. We must follow their trail!\nGOMPHUS: Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 23\nCOLIN: (CALLING) Two more coffees, please. — Just ordinary.\nHELEN: “Just ordinary”. You’re so old-fashioned, Colin.\nCOLIN: Can’t help that, can I, Hel?\nHELEN: You should try to fit in. Be more ‘now’. (TUTS) The way you dress! That shirt.\nCOLIN: What’s wrong with this shirt?\nHELEN: Colin, it’s fluorescent. —’You were saying? About living with your Mum?\nCOLIN: Oh. Well — I mean, it got awkward for a bit. But now she’s started getting on, half the time she thinks she’s back in the Sixties anyhow. So every cloud...\nHELEN: Colin, that’s an awful thing to say!\nCOLIN: Yeah, I know. — Look, what’s the plan, Hel? The auction house’1ll be closing soon.\nHELEN: We'll go back, once it’s quiet. We’1ll find out who bought the clock.\nCOLIN: What if they won’t tell us?\nHELEN: Then we’ll use the powers. We’ll make them tell us.\nCOLIN: (SULKY) I don’t want to, Hel.\nHELEN: We’ve got no choice.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 24\nCOLIN: All that time, nothing. Then out of the blue, three weeks ago —\nCOLIN: OF SCENE 45:\nCOLIN: Woke up, there he was. (MIMICS LAUGH) Looked in the mirror, there he was. (MIMICS LAUGH) So I did a Search, and I read about Mikey, and that’s when I knew he’d come back. d You really think he’ll help us? After everything?\nHELEN: You do, too, or you wouldn’t be here. Look. He was angry with Mikey. Not with us.\nCOLIN: Wish Janine was here. She knew how to get around him. I guess it must have been an accident, but you can’t help but wonder...\nHELEN: Come on, Col. Janine was always getting herself in situations. She was never going to make old bones.\nCOLIN: Yeah, but neither are we.\nHELEN: Not unless we find him. That’s why we have to use the powers.\nCOLIN: I’m scared, though, Hel. I’m scared of him. Our master.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: DRIVER'S SIDE.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE; WALKING TO STOP, THROUGH THE ABOVE) It’s getting late. We have to get back into town as quickly as possible. I knew I should have stayed where I was, watching the auction rooms. By fair means or foul, he’1ll find a way to recover his [T-]\nANNIE: No.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE; BAFFLED) (FX: TAPS WINDOW) Annie? Could you —\nANNIE: (PULLING ON SEATBELT) No.\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE; BAFFLED) “No”?\nANNIE: Not unless you tell me what’s really going on.\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) If I tell you what’s really going on, you won’t give me a Litt,\nANNIE: Try me.\nDOCTOR: Annie, please! At best you’1ll think I’m having some sort of joke at your expense; at worst you’1ll think I’m some kind of lunatic. Either way, you’1ll more than likely drive off and leave me to walk however-many-miles-it-is back into town and I’m sorry, but I just don’t have the time!\nANNIE: Mind your fingers.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE; AS WINDOW CLOSES) Alright! The clock — well, it’s a time machine!\nANNIE: What clock isn’t?\nDOCTOR: (OUTSIDE) Not literally! (THINKS) I mean, yes, literally! A machine that travels through time! That sort of time machine! — Please!\nANNIE: A “time machine”, time machine?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nANNIE: Hop in.\nANNIE: GUNS IGNITION. CAR SQUEALS OFF GRAVEL. CONTINUES DIRECTLY INTO:\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR: I know we’re in a hurry, but we needn’t go quite so fast —\nANNIE: Seatbelt.\nDOCTOR: Seatbelt. (FX: PULLS SEATBELT OVER)\nANNIE: Now: everything.\nDOCTOR: The clock is a time machine. A TARDIS. It stands for — well, never mind what it stands for.\nANNIE: But it’s alien. — Like you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. What happened was, my TARDIS was parked close to this area of space/time [whown the road in Little Hodcombe, as a matter of fact o\nANNIE: (INTERRUPTING) Your TARDIS. That’s a clock, too?\nDOCTOR: A TARDIS can take any shape. A Greek column. An iron maiden. Concorde.\nANNIE: Concorde?!\nDOCTOR: Indeed. That’s where I was, anyway, when my TARDIS intercepted a sort of distress signal from the other TARDIS. Given that Signalulatrace, I judged it highly likely that it had been sent by one TARDIS in particular —\nANNIE: Michael Masterson’s.\nDOCTOR: The Master’s. “Masterson”, it seems, was simply the latest ina long line of rather tiresome aliases.\nANNIE: So you rushed to answer his call.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t him calling. It was his TARDIS. A signal to indicate that it had been abandoned by its operator. Obviously, it was my duty to locate it and return it to... well, our planet of origin. So I followed its artron trail to the auction rooms here in Upper Hexford, and that’s where I met you.\nANNIE: Right. So we’re speeding back there so you can catch up with your friend?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nANNIE: The friend who you seem to think has recently crawled out of his own grave?\nDOCTOR: Well, he’s regenerated. I can’t let him leave, not until I’ve found out what he’s been doing here for thirty years or more. Who knows what dreadful scheme he might have spent that time fomenting?\nANNIE: Scrumpy, that’s all he’d been fermenting. There was jar after jar in the old cottage kitchen. (QUICKLY) Apparently.\nDOCTOR: Cider?!\nANNIE: He’d been growing vegetables, too. Potatoes and carrots, broad beans. Completely self-sufficient.\nDOCTOR: That doesn’t sound like the Master.\nANNIE: It doesn’t really matter, though.\nDOCTOR: Anything to do with the Master matters.\nANNIE: No, I meant — Look, just open the glove compartment.\nANNIE: Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess in there. You might have to root around for it.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR: (ROOTING AROUND) What am I looking for, exactly?\nANNIE: You'll see.\nDOCTOR: (DISTASTE) Gummy sweets — (THEN; METAL SCRAPE — A KEY) A key!\nANNIE: For winding up a grandfather clock?\nDOCTOR: Obviously. Annie, this is the key to the Master’s TARDIS!\nANNIE: I.. found it wedged behind a loose brick in the fireplace of the old cottage, when I was having a look around.\nDOCTOR: That’s what you were doing at the auction!\nANNIE: When I found out that the clock was for sale, I thought, even if I didn’t get it, I might be able to sell the key to whoever did. So you see — even if your friend has got to that clock- TARDIS of his, he won’t be leaving.\nDOCTOR: Not without the key, no. The only trouble is — if he’s recently regenerated, I won’t know who he is.\nANNIE: (SARCASTICALLY) This ‘really old friend’ of yours.\nDOCTOR: He might not look old, now. He might look young. He might look like anyone.\nANNIE: So he might have been at the auction...?\nDOCTOR: He might, yes.\nANNIE: Best we get a move on, then.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 30\nAUCTIONEER: (CALLING) I’m afraid the auction rooms are closed!\nAUCTIONEER: (CALLING) I said, we are closed!\nCOLIN: (OUTSIDE) Please, we want to talk to you!\nAUCTIONEER: (CALLING) We reopen at nine A.M. tomorrow!\nHELEN: (OUTSIDE) Look, open up or we’re calling the police!\nCOLIN: (OUTSIDE) Yeah, tell them all about your iffy gear!\nAUCTIONEER: This is an old family firm. We do not sell “iffy gear”!\nHELEN: (OUTSIDE) Ignore my friend, he’s an idiot. It’s about the you sold earlier?\nAUCTIONEER: What about it?\nCOLIN: (OUTSIDE) We know what it really is. Where it really came\nHELEN: At last.\nCOLIN: (NERVOUSLY) Your gorilla’s knocked off for the night, has\nAUCTIONEER: clock\nAUCTIONEER: from?\nAUCTIONEER: he?\nAUCTIONEER: I confess, I am curious to know why a purely ornamental piece\nAUCTIONEER: should have attracted such attention —\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 31\nCOLIN: Yeah, you’re worried you might have missed a trick.\nHELEN: (TO AUCTIONEER) The phone bidder. Who were they? When are they coming to collect?\nAUCTIONEER: I’m afraid that’s confidential information.\nHELEN: Please. We don’t want to have to make you tell us.\nAUCTIONEER: (‘HOW RIDICULOUS!’) You? Make me what..? — I think perhaps it’s I who should be calling the police.\nCOLIN: You don’t want to do that, mate.\nHELEN: Just tell us when they’re coming. That’s all!\nAUCTIONEER: (WALKING) I am calling the police..!\nCOLIN: (SUDDENLY COMMANDING) No! You — stay where you are.\nAUCTIONEER: (STOPS IN TRACKS) What...?\nHELEN: (MESMERIC) Stay, and look into our eyes.\nAUCTIONEER: Into your eyes...?\nCOLIN: (MESMERIC) That’s right. Into our eyes.\nHELEN: You will obey us.\nMASTER: Obey me. Obey!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR: (GETTING OUT) Here we are.\nANNIE: You know — it’s strange, Doctor. That key. When I found it — it was almost like I had to get it to the clock.\nDOCTOR: The Master had a powerful personality. Perhaps his influence\nDOCTOR: still lingers.\nANNIE: Perhaps you should keep hold of the key.\nDOCTOR: Yes, perhaps I should. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 33\nCIRCLING: (SOUND WAFTING AROUND IN THE BACKGROUND).\nHELEN: Who bought the clock?\nCOLIN: When are they coming?\nHELEN: & COLIN: Tell us!!!\nAUCTIONEER: (MESMERISED) There.. there was a voice, down the end of the line. It said I had to obey...\nCOLIN: ‘Obey’?\nHELEN: When are they coming?\nAUCTIONEER: Now.\nDOCTOR: (AT DOOR) Er, hello? Sorry, the door was open.\nAUCTIONEER: You again!\nANNIE: Me too.\nCOLIN: Hel, they were at the auction. Both of them!\nDOCTOR: Yes, we were as a matter of fact. We’ve come about that clock.\nAUCTIONEER: I wish I’d never set eyes on the wretched item!\nHELEN: Ssh! That noise —\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 34\nCOLIN: It’s a helicopter. It’s been circling the village green the last minute or so. Might be a Russian MI-8?\nHELEN: Never mind the make. The auctioneer said the buyer was coming now.\nCOLIN: Yeah, so?\nDOCTOR: I think our young friend is referring to the fact that the MI-8\nDOCTOR: is a troop carrier.\nANNIE: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 35\nJANINE: (CALLING BACK) You all know what to do! Straight in, straight\nJANINE: out!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 36\nANNIE: You were right, Doctor. There are soldiers, coming down on lines!\nAUCTIONEER: Soldiers?!\nCOLIN: Great, now we’re messing with the Russians!\nDOCTOR: The uniforms are wrong. Mercenaries, perhaps?\nCOLIN: Mercenaries, even better. — Hel, let’s get out of here while we can...!\nCOLIN: OFF. HEAVY BOOTS RUNNING UP, EQUIPMENT CLATTERING.\nHELEN: Stay put, Colin! You’1l get shot.\nANNIE: Doctor — they’re armed!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and those aren’t ordinary weapons...\nAUCTIONEER: (COMPELLED) I remember. It is... as I was told. Over the telephone.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) Who spoke to you, over the telephone?\nAUCTIONEER: It is as I was told.\nGRIGOR: [LEAD MERCENARY ] (RUNS TO STOP) You! Where is item for collection?\nAUCTIONEER: (SHAKING OFF HYPNOSIS) The... item is in the back area.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 37\nGRIGOR: (TO 2 x SOLDIERS) Artem, Timor, go with him. Fetch the clock. Go, go!\nDOCTOR: Excuse me cer, Sergeant? Doesn’t all this seem a little over the top, just to secure a purely ornamental grandfather clock?\nANNIE: The Doctor asked you a question.\nDOCTOR: No? Perhaps you’d care to tell us who sent you, and where you’re taking it?\nHELEN: He doesn’t seem to want to talk.\nAUCTIONEER: (FOLLOWING FROM BACK ROOM) Do be careful with that!\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find that clock is rather more robust than it looks.\nGRIGOR: You, man in white.\nDOCTOR: ‘White’?\nGRIGOR: You close door.\nDOCTOR: Very well.\nGRIGOR: Now you join others.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 38\nCOLIN: (NERVOUSLY) W-what happens now?\nGRIGOR: (INTO R/T) Item secured. Five witnesses. Instructions? (BEAT\nFOR: “STUN THEM”) Roger that.\nAUCTIONEER: May we leave now?\nGRIGOR: No. You will not be leaving.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. As our Auctioneer friend observed, that is no ordinary weapon.\nCOLIN: Too right it’s not!\nDOCTOR: It’s a staser gun, in fact.\nANNIE: Taser?\nDOCTOR: Not Taser, staser. Which is odd, because staser guns are Gallifreyan technology.\nHELEN: (ALARMED) Colin, concentrate! Use the p—\nCOLIN: (RUSHES OVER) Hel! Hel, are you alr—\nDOCTOR WHO: ..

Well, at least that’s something.\nGRIGOR: Do not move! I have my instructions.\nDOCTOR: And you must obey, I suppose? (TO SOLDIER) Please, uh, Sergeant? Might I talk to your — commander? Controller? I’ve a feeling that he and I might be very old acquaintances.\nGRIGOR: I do not believe that.\nDOCTOR: Your master wouldn’t want you to stun me, let alone kill me. Not if he knew who I was.\nGRIGOR: My (MIMICKING HIM) ‘master’ is a she. So I know you are\nGRIGOR: [lying.]\nBROKEN: THROUGH A SKYLIGHT].\nANNIE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: It came from the rear of the premises. The storage area.\nGRIGOR: Who else is here? Tell me!\nDOCTOR: I’ve no idea.\nANNIE: I don’t mind looking, if that’s all right with our Russian friend?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 42\nGRIGOR: Both of you. Open the doors. One side each. Do it, or I kill you now!\nDOCTOR: Is this to be a permanent reprieve, or is it only temporary?\nANNIE: Why would you want to antagonise him?\nGRIGOR: Open doors. Open them now. Slowly...!\nGRIGOR: DOORS.\nDOCTOR: See? Nothing there.\nGRIGOR: What in-?\nANNIE: Apart from the two eight-foot floating dragonflies.\nDOCTOR: Good heavens. Dragonhunters!\nGRIGOR: (INTO R/T) Control? Control? Requesting instructions!\nJADE NYMPH: Dragonmaster? There is a creature here with a staser gun!\nGOMPHUS: Does it appear dangerous to you, my novice?\nJADE NYMPH: It does.\nGOMPHUS: Then you may disarm it.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 43\nGRIGOR: (OVER R/T) They are dragonflies. They are eight feet high!\nJANINE: Do they appear dangerous?\nGRIGOR: (OVER R/T) They are eight feet high dragonflies! [Eight f-]\nJANINE: Sergeant-at-arms? — Grigor? What’s happening? Grigor! (OBVIOUSLY, NO ANSWER COMING) Never mind. Pilot? Is the item\nJANINE: secure? — Then proceed back to base. (BEAT) Proceed!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 44\nGOMPHUS: Is the creature disarmed?\nJADE NYMPH: It is, Dragonmaster.\nANNIE: (ASIDE) What was that thing that shot out of its thorax? A sting?\nDOCTOR: It carried an electrical charge. Rather like a biological Taser.\nANNIE: Taser, not staser?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. (CHECKING PULSE) He’s unconscious, but he’1ll live. Now, where’s that radio? — Ah!\nGOMPHUS: Do not touch the communications device!\nDOCTOR: Please, I need to speak to whoever was controlling this man.\nANNIE: No point, Doctor. Hear that?\nJADE NYMPH: Hear... what?\nANNIE: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) The helicopter’s gone. They’1l be out of range!\nGOMPHUS: We may still trace them. My novice — the fallen soldier. Take his consciousness.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 45\nJADE NYMPH: Dragonmaster Gomphus, I am flattered you would entrust me with such a task.\nANNIE: ‘Take his consciousness’ ?\nDOCTOR: They’re Dragonhunters. A race of insectoid assassins with breeding grounds in Galaxy Five. Among their attributes is the ability to liquefy and absorb the contents of their victims’ brains.\nANNIE: How do you even know this?\nDROOLING: STICKY SALIVA. KIND OF LIKE THE INNER JAW EMERGING FROM THE HEAD OF THE H.R. GIGER ‘ALIEN’.\nDOCTOR: One sort of picks it up, I suppose. — She’s going to use that needle-like proboscis, see?\nANNIE: Won’t that kill him?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (STEPPING IN, LOUDLY) Which is why I’d sooner she stopped!\nJADE NYMPH: Stand aside, human!\nDOCTOR: I’m not human. And if you think that liquefying this man’s brain will help you find the Master, well — I think you’re mistaken!\nJADE NYMPH: The Master...!\nGOMPHUS: The Jade Nymph and I observed you both in the burial ground. We followed you here so we might locate the creature known as the Master.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, I’m afraid I don’t know where he is. Or what he even looks like at the moment.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 46\nGOMPHUS: Then you are of no interest to us. Proceed with the extraction!\nDOCTOR: Please, stop, you mustn’t!\nGOMPHUS: Is this not one of the Master’s henchmen? That is what we presumed.\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. But if this man was under the Master’s control, then his consciousness will have been addled. Any information you’re able to glean from it will be unreliable. What’s more, it won’t taste very nice!\nGOMPHUS: We Dragonhunters do not kill for killing’s sake. Nor for bounty, like you.\nDOCTOR: ‘Bounty’?\nGOMPHUS: But should you continue to impede our honourable mission...!\nANNIE: Ah! Get off me!\nGOMPHUS: Quiet, parasite!\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) You think we’re bounty hunters!\nGOMPHUS: Why else would you be seeking the Master in this place?\nANNIE: I’ve no idea what any of you are on about.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, everything’s starting to become clear. — So there’s a price on the Master’s head, is there?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 47\nGOMPHUS: Bounty hunters have followed the Master’s trail here. So we have followed theirs. The final part of my novice the Jade Nymph’s initiation is to make his ignoble killing noble.\nJADE NYMPH: And I shall not fail in my task, Dragonmaster!\nDOCTOR: I can’t let Earth become a battleground for intergalactic assassins. Not when this is Time Lord business.\nGOMPHUS: You are a Time Lord?\nJADE NYMPH: Like the Master?\nDOCTOR: Yes. So please — let these humans go, and I will help you!\nGOMPHUS: How?\nDOCTOR: I have the key to his TARDIS. — (PRODUCES KEY) See?\nANNIE: Yes, and I gave it to you!\nDOCTOR: It generates its own low-level psychic field. Homing in on the telepathic circuits in the Master’s TARDIS. That’s why it was able to influence this woman’s actions. And that’s why I’1l be able to use the telepathic circuits in my own TARDIS to home in on the Master’s ship.\nJADE NYMPH: (CATCHING ON) Dragonmaster — wherever the Master’s TARDIS is...\nGOMPHUS: (EXCITED) That is where he will be!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: IN THE ROOM IS WOOZY, DISTORTED — DOESN’T HAVE TO BE CLEAR.\nDOCTOR: (D) Well, Dragonhunters? Do we have a deal?\nMASTER: (FROM SCENE 41) Help me!\nCOLIN: Whuh...?\nJADE NYMPH: (D) Great Dragonmaster, you know Time Lords better than I. Can this one be trusted?\nGOMPHUS: (D) It is said that no Time Lord can be trusted. But this is your test, my novice.\nMASTER: (FROM SCENE 41) I said, help me!\nJADE NYMPH: (D) I believe.. there are two of us, and only one of him.\nGOMPHUS: (D) Then we should let him help us.\nMASTER: (FROM SCENE 41) Cretin!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: 27. %INT. AUCTION ROOMS — FOYER [CONTINUOUS ]\nCOLIN: (STIRS, STILL HALF-CONSCIOUS) Aaah...!\nANNIE: (STILL IN GOMPHUS’ GRIP) The boy’s coming round.\nDOCTOR: Yes, the staser stun-shot’s wearing off. — I take it that’s a ‘Yes’, then, Dragonhunters? You’1l come with me to my TARDIS?\nJADE NYMPH: Be warned, Time Lord: there will be two of us...\nDOCTOR: But only one of me, yes.\nANNIE: What about me?\nDOCTOR: You’1l have to stay here, I’m afraid.\nANNIE: That’s all the thanks I get, is it?\nDOCTOR: Dragonmaster — please, let her go.\nGOMPHUS: Agreed. (LETS GO OF ANNIE)\nANNIE: Much obliged. — What about all this lot? These teenagers?\nJADE NYMPH: We should kill them. They may be bounty hunters. Or the Master’s creatures.\nDOCTOR: No, I think they were just innocent bystanders. (TO ANNIE) You might want to tie that soldier up, though. He could be dangerous.\nANNIE: Me? — I don’t know how to tie people up!\nDOCTOR: Improvise, it’s what all the best people do.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 50\nGOMPHUS: We should depart.\nDOCTOR: Yes. (WALKING TO DOOR) Thank you for all your help, Annie. Really, it’s been most appreciated. But believe me, the best way I can return the favour is to not let you get involved any further.\nANNIE: You might be right.\nDOCTOR: Actually, before I go, would you pass me that staser? I ought\nDOCTOR: to make it safe...\nANNIE: Don’t worry, I’ll throw it in the river. Improvise, right?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: Right, then, Dragonhunters. I left my TARDIS in a lay-by, a mile or so north. You’1l have to follow me from the air.\nJADE NYMPH: We cannot let go of you.\nGOMPHUS: We do not trust Time Lords.\nDOCTOR: What are you going to do? Fly me there?\nDOCTOR: BEGINNING TO SPEED UP.\nJADE NYMPH: Do you have a tight hold of him, Dragonmaster?\nGOMPHUS: I do.\nDOCTOR: What, really? If you wouldn’t mind, I'd rather waaaaaaaaaaaaa— [1k]\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: BEAT.\nANNIE: They’ve gone. You can stop pretending now. — Children, I’m talking to you!\nCOLIN: (GETTING UP) Look, stop calling us children! We’re f[orty—]\nHELEN: (CUTTING OVER) Colin, that’s enough! (GETTING UP) How did you know, um...?\nANNIE: Annie. I saw your boyfriend picking his nose on the quiet.\nCOLIN: I was scratching!\nHELEN: He’s not my boyfriend. —nThank you, Annie. You can go now.\nANNIE: Can I?\nHELEN: We're fine here. Really.\nANNIE: I’m not going anywhere. I’m going to wake up Boris-not-Johnson there, and find out if he knows where the Doctor’s gone.\nCOLIN: Do you even know a word of Russian?\nANNIE: No, but I’ve got this, er —\nHELEN: Staser, yes. — Colin? Shall we help the lady?\nANNIE: I don’t need any help. (FIRMLY) You two — go.\nGRIGOR: (STIRRING; SEMI-CONSCIOUS) Strekozy...! [NB: MEANS ‘DRAGONFLIES’ ]\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 53\nCOLIN: Listen to that. It’s wearing off.\nHELEN: That’s why you need our help, Annie. Colin there used to be a Sea Scout.\nANNIE: So?\nHELEN: You don’t know how to tie people up. But Colin knows all the knots — don’t you, Colin?\nCOLIN: (PROUDLY) Bowline. Sheepshank. Sheet bend. Double sheet bend. Figure of eight. Fireman’s chair. Clove hitch. Rolling [hitch]\nANNIE: Alright, alright!\nCOLIN: Not forgetting the good old Reef.\nGRIGOR: (STIRRING) Strekozy...! Niet...!\nANNIE: Yes, I could use your help.\nCOLIN: We'd best find some rope, then.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: THRESHOLD.\nDOCTOR: Hover in. There’s plenty of room.\nGOMPHUS: Dimensional transcendence. I have heard of this!\nDOCTOR: FOLLOWS.\nJADE NYMPH: It flies, this conveyance?\nDOCTOR: It’s a little more convenient than being hoisted up by the pair of you, (WINCES) and a lot less wearing on one’s shoulders.\nDOCTOR: Now, then. —\nJADE NYMPH: What are these sounds?\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS’s telepathic circuits are tuning into the telepathic circuits in the Master’s TARDIS.\nGOMPHUS: So where is it?\nDOCTOR: There’s too much noise at ground level, I’m afraid. Short-wave transmissions, long-wave transmissions, frequency modulated transmissions, microwave transmissions. Like trying to make out a whisper through the wall of a discotheque. (FX: PRESSING BUTTONS) Perhaps if I take her a few thousand feet up...?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 55\nGRIGOR: (PULLED; GROANS) Strekozy..tStrekozy!\nCOLIN: That should do it.\nHELEN: What is that, he keeps on saying?\nANNIE: At a guess... “Dragonflies”?\nCOLIN: Well, at least we know a word of Russian now.\nHELEN: He’s still not properly conscious. Perhaps we should — I don’t know, throw some water in his face?\nAUCTIONEER: (STRUGGLING UP) You people. What are you doing?\nCOLIN: Oh look, now the Cravat King’s woken up!\nHELEN: Please, we just need to talk to this man.\nGRIGOR: Niet...!\nAUCTIONEER: This is a respectable auction house, not a, a torture chamber! — This madness must stop. Helicopters. Russians. Ray guns...\nANNIE: Just be thankful you missed the giant dragonflies.\nGRIGOR: Strekozy...!\nAUCTIONEER: I will not tolerate this one moment more. I’m calling the police.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 56\nCOLIN: Good luck with that, mister. Do you even know the response time, out here in the sticks? We’ll be long gone before the cops arrive.\nAUCTIONEER: (BEGINS MARCHING TO DOOR) Then I shall call for assistance elsewhere!\nHELEN: He’s making for the door! Stop him, Colin!\nCOLIN: Why can’t you?\nAUCTIONEER: (CALLING OUT) Help! Thie—h[ves! ]\nCOLIN: You didn’t just —\nANNIE: (QUICKLY) Don’t worry, it’s still set to stun.\nCOLIN: You’re sure?\nANNIE: Yes!\nHELEN: Leave him, Colin. Fetch a bucket of water, do something useful.\nANNIE: We don’t need water. Our Russian friend’s wide awake now.\nHELEN: He still looks out of it to me.\nANNIE: No, he flinched when I fired the gun. (SHARPLY) Didn’t you?\nGRIGOR: I tell you nothing. You are not soldiers, you will not hurt me. You are interfering English people, that is all.\nANNIE: Silly boy, I’m not just no-one. I’m with M.I. Five.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 57\nGRIGOR: (UNCERTAIN) M. I.—?\nCOLIN: What, really? You’re a spook? Really?\nHELEN: If she was, she’d know how to tie someone up, stupid.\nANNIE: Nice Annie was my cover. Nice Annie, house-hunting in Hexford. Of course Nice Annie wouldn’t know how to tie someone up. — Nasty Annie, on the other hand... (CLOSE TO GRIGOR) Nasty Annie knows how to tie someone to those rafters by their ankles, and let them swing. Nasty Annie’s observed the cabinet over there, full of cavalry swords...\nCOLIN: Oh yeah...! — Oh wow.\nANNIE: So what do you think, my Russian friend? Do you want to talk to Nice Annie, nicely? Or do I have to get Nasty?\nGRIGOR: (SWALLOWS HARD) If... if I tell you what you want to know, will I be protected? Will I have — what is word? — Immunity!\nANNIE: First, you tell me everything. Then... I’1l see what I can do.\nGRIGOR: I am with private security firm. Dirty jobs. Wet jobs. All round world, for different clients.\nANNIE: So who’s your client now? Your master?\nGRIGOR: She has rented big house, in gated compound. We fetch, we carry, we guard perimeter. We obey. We think, perhaps, she is oligarch’s mistress? But we do not ask questions. People like that hire people who do not ask questions.\nANNIE: Where is it, this compound?\nGRIGOR: I do not know roads from here. (BRIGHTLY) But I do know G.P.S. reference!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: There, let’s see how everything looks at thirty-two thousand feet, shall we...?\nLESS: STATICKY AND DISTORTED, THROUGH:\nGOMPHUS: Why is it taking so long?\nDOCTOR: Patience, Dragonmaster, patience!\nJADE NYMPH: We cannot wait forever. I am already three days old. Dragonmaster Gomphus is nearly thirty!\nDOCTOR: Yes, you have mayfly lives. A lot to pack in, I suppose.\nGOMPHUS: Soon, perhaps within hours, my wings will begin to crack and crumble. Then, it will be the Jade Nymph’s privilege to drain every last scintilla of life experience from my brain.\nDOCTOR: Through her proboscis, I presume?\nGOMPHUS: Each new generation absorbs the knowledge of the last.\nDOCTOR: You know, that really is a fascinating adaptation. (CASUALLY) Tell me, Dragonhunters — should we succeed in locating the Master, what will you do to him?\nJADE NYMPH: Slay him, of course.\nGOMPHUS: The Master’s misdeeds are infamous across the seven galaxies. A life devoted in its entirety to the pursuit, capture and despatch of such a monster would not be wasted.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can see why you might think that way. Every second counts to a member of your species. Every millisecond, even.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 59\nJADE NYMPH: Even this conversation is an eternity! (CALLING OUT) TARDIS! If you truly are a thinking machine, hear this — if have not located the Master within one Earth minute, I shall begin to eat your pilot! Piece by piece by piece!\nDOCTOR: I don’t think she’1ll take kindly to threats.\nJADE NYMPH: Fifty seconds!\nDOCTOR: I quite agree, the Master has done many terrible things — cruel, unwarranted, evil things; for cruel, unwarranted, evil reasons. Or worse, no reason at all.\nJADE NYMPH: Forty!\nDOCTOR: But now I’ve been told that something happened to the Master. He changed. Not just now, but more than thirty Earth years ago. He stopped. He hid himself away.\nJADE NYMPH: Thirty!\nDOCTOR: I want to know why. Perhaps he was hiding from assassins like you. Perhaps he destroyed himself deliberately, so he might regenerate and escape in another form.\nJADE NYMPH: Twenty!\nDOCTOR: Perhaps, in his post-regenerative delusion, he doesn’t even know who he is any more. Perhaps he’s no longer — well, evil.\nJADE NYMPH: Ten!\nDOCTOR: A naive hope, I know. Your tragedy, Dragonhunters, is that you don’t have the time to listen. Mine is, I have far too much.\nJADE NYMPH: No, Doctor. Now, your time is up...!\nJADE NYMPH: MATERIALISATION. AS IF A TARDIS WERE CRYING.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 60\nGOMPHUS: What is that noise? What does it mean?\nDOCTOR: It’s the distress signal emitted by the Master’s TARDIS! The one that drew me here in the first place!\nDOCTOR: Latitude fifty-point-nine-three... something. Still in motion, but beginning to slow down.\nGOMPHUS: Wait. You say a distress signal drew you here? From the Master’s TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Well, yes —\nJADE NYMPH: Then you came here to answer that call. You mean to aid the Master!\nDOCTOR: Not necessarily, no. — Look, do you want to find the Master or\nDOCTOR: not?\nGOMPHUS: Take us to him! Now!!!\nDOCTOR: Very well —\nJADE NYMPH: Hurry.

We have arrived?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: So it would appear.\nJADE NYMPH: Then let us go and kill the Master. Come, Dragonmaster!\nGOMPHUS: Doctor, open the doors!\nDOCTOR: Well, if you’re sure —\nDOCTOR: OUTSIDE, A HURRICANE.\nJADE NYMPH: What is this?!\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) We appear to have materialised in the eye of an Atlantic hurricane!\nGOMPHUS: What?!\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) It’s alright, I’ve got a tight grip of the console! You, on the other hand —\nJADE: NYMPH & GOMPHUS:\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT AS HE... FX: CLOSES DOORS) Sorry about that, old girl. But I warned them, we don’t much care for violence. — Now.\nDOCTOR: Let’s get you out of this storm. What were those co-ordinates again?\nDOCTOR: Latitude..afifty-point-nine-three-three-nine. Longitude... minus\nDOCTOR: two-point-four. There.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 62\nANNIE: Latitude..afifty-point-nine-three-three-nine. Longitude... minus two-point-four. There. Sixty point oh-five miles. Thank you.\nGRIGOR: Grigor. My name is Grigor.\nANNIE: Grigor. Is there nothing else you can tell me?\nGRIGOR: Is big house, all metal and glass. Nothing but fields around. You will not miss it.\nCOLIN: (ASIDE) She’s for real, Hel. Actually for real!\nHELEN: (ASIDE) I don’t know, Colin.\nCOLIN: (ASIDE) Don’t you get it? We can tell her everything. She can protect us, too!\nGRIGOR: I go with you? I get protection now?\nANNIE: You’re staying here.\nGRIGOR: Then —hyou are going there?\nHELEN: To this ‘compound’ ?\nCOLIN: Right now?\nANNIE: I think the Doctor could use some back-up.\nCOLIN: Well, we’re coming with you!\nANNIE: Colin, you’re going nowhere.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 63\nCOLIN: Yes, we are! Me and Helen — we were thinking... Well, we were thinking we’d tell you everything, too. About us. About (HUSHED) the Master.\nHELEN: Colin...!\nCOLIN: Come on, there’s no point pretending, not any more.\nANNIE: You know about the Master?\nCOLIN: Yeah, we know all about the Master.\nHELEN: We met him once, a while back. We thought he was dead, but he’s not, is he?\nANNIE: No, I don’t believe he is.\nCOLIN: We want to find him; M.I. Five want to find him; that Doctor wants to find him. Makes sense if we all join forces, right?\nANNIE: (CONSIDERING) You know about the Master.\nHELEN: It’s a long story.\nCOLIN: Yeah, but it’s a long drive. We can tell you on the way.\nANNIE: All right.\nCOLIN: What, seriously?\nANNIE: Yes, seriously. To be honest, it’s a relief.\nHELEN: How do you mean?\nANNIE: I thought I was going to have to kill you.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 64\nCOLIN: Right...\nANNIE: Spy joke, fell flat, sorry. (FX: PULLS DOOR OPEN) Come on, we'd better go. (USHERING COLIN AND HELEN OUT) Go, go! Before I change my mind!\nHELEN: (EXITING) Come on then, Colin...\nGRIGOR: Hey. —eHey! What about me? What about protection?\nANNIE: You just wait there. Someone will come for you. (EXITS)\nGRIGOR: (CALLING AFTER) Don’t let them be too long, eh?\nANNIE: Hello, Grigor.\nGRIGOR: You back already?\nANNIE: I forgot my handbag.\nGRIGOR: When did you have handbag?\nANNIE: That’s what I told those children, anyway. (PRODUCES STASER)\nGRIGOR: What are you doing with staser? You are going to stun me again?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 65\nANNIE: I’m not going to stun you, Grigor. Just like I didn’t stun that Auctioneer.\nGRIGOR: Eh?\nANNIE: (CALLING) Sorry! I’m right here! I’m coming!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: GROUND, STARTS WALKING OFF.\nJANINE: Come on, I want that clock secured in the basement!

You don’t like it when I make you [obey]\nJANINE: DROPS TO TARMAC.\nJANINE: What the-?\nMIKEY: (STEPPING OUT FROM INSIDE HELICOPTER) Don’t move, Janine.\nJANINE: I — (“HOW RIDICULOUS!”) My name isn’t ‘Janine’!\nMIKEY: It used to be, a long time ago. You haven’t changed. Yeah,\nMIKEY: you’re just the same.\nJANINE: Who are you? Take those silly sunglasses off, so I can see.\nMIKEY: (DOES SO) Remember me now?\nJANINE: No. No-! It can’t be. Divvy Mikey!\nMIKEY: Don’t call me that.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 67\nJANINE: Divvy Mikey. Wow, you got old. But what have you done to my boys? My lovely Russian boys. Timor and... the other one. With the prison tattoos.\nMIKEY: I was watching the auction house, waiting for whoever bought that ‘clock’ to come and collect.\nJANINE: Bet you weren’t expecting a helicopter.\nMIKEY: No. But I climbed up the line, while your goons were bringing the hclock’ aboard. Then I showed them what a real gun looks like. My brother’s old Browning. I got them to hand over their stasers and (MAKES STASER SOUND).\nJANINE: (FLATLY) You stunned them.\nMIKEY: Maximum setting. They’1ll be out for hours. — Where is he, Janine?\nJANINE: Inside.\nMIKEY: I knew it. I knew he’d come back.\nJANINE: Oh, he came back...\nMIKEY: He got to you, and now you’re working for him.\nJANINE: Like I said, he’s inside.\nMIKEY: Hands on your head. Janine. Turn around and take me to him.\nJANINE: Ohh, I get it. You think he’s inside there. In the house.\nMIKEY: He’s not?\nJANINE: Nooo. He’s inside. In... here.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 68\nMIKEY: In... you?\nJANINE: Take a look, Mikey. Look into my eyes. What do you see?\nMIKEY: He’s inside you!\nJANINE: No, don’t look away, Mikey. Look into my eyes...\nSOUND: FADES.\nJANINE: Look — Oh, what’s the use, you’re all distracted!\nMIKEY: That sound. You remember? That sound!\nMASTER: That sound... !\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: (EXITING, CALLING OUT WARILY) Hello? (FX: CLOSES DOOR) Hell1o...?\nMIKEY: (RUNNING UP FROM OFF) Doctor. You took your time.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nMIKEY: You don’t remember me, do you? You don’t remember me at all. My name’s Michael. Mikey, for short.\nDOCTOR: Michael? (REALISATION) Not... Michael Masterson?\nMIKEY: That stupid name. Yeah. I’m Michael Masterson.\nJANINE: (ARRIVING) Masterson. Do you get it? Master... son. Son of the Master. Masterson!\nDOCTOR: Really? And who might you be?\nMIKEY: Don’t listen to her, Doctor. She was the one who bought the clock. She’s working for the Master!\nJANINE: “Doctor”? — You’re the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I am, yes. I’m sorry, you seem to have me at a disadvantage, miss...?\nJANINE: That police box. That’s your spaceship? Your TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: It is, aS a matter of fact.\nJANINE: That man there. The Master’s son. He’s got a gun. A staser gun. He wants to kill us both.\nDOCTOR WHO: .. AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR: What?\nMIKEY: I said, don’t listen to her...!\nJANINE: But you could take me away, couldn’t you, Doctor? Away from all this, in your TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: We've not yet been properly introduced.\nJANINE: Look at me, Doctor. Look into my eyes...\nDOCTOR: Your eyes...?\nJANINE: Obey me, Doctor! Look into my eyes, and obey!\nMASTER: Obey me. Obey!\nDOCTOR: Are you trying to hypnotise me...?\nMIKEY: I’m warning you, Janine...!\nSOUND: FADES SUPER-QUICKLY.\nJANINE: Mikey, I nearly had him!\nDOCTOR: I’m not as susceptible to hypnotism as you seem to think, young woman.\nJANINE: (SULKY) My name’s Janine.\nMIKEY: She’s dangerous, Doctor. What’s inside her is dangerous.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: Possibly. But so is that weapon you’re carrying, er, Mikey. Really, it’d be far better if you gave it to me.\nMIKEY: I’ll keep it for now, thanks.\nJANINE: Doctor, you have to help me. He comes into my head. The Master. He talks to me. Please, can you make him go away?\nDOCTOR: Well, I can try. Perhaps we could discuss this further inside? This may sound odd, but there are creatures, Dragonhunters. Eight foot tall alien assassins, with wings.\nMIKEY: No, it figures. They’re looking for the Master, too?\nDOCTOR: Indeed. I tried to shake them off, in the air. But I don’t suppose they’1l be far behind.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 72\nMIKEY: All right, get in. Both of you.\nDOCTOR: All this glass. It’s not secure.\nJANINE: It’s intelligent glass, silly. State of the art. Close the door.\nJANINE: There. Now we can see out, but no-one else can see in.\nMIKEY: He gave you everything you wanted, then. The luxury lifestyle.\nJANINE: It wasn’t him, actually. It’s brilliant, it’s all voice- controlled. House: a low fire, please.\nJANINE: There, that’s better.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Forgive me, but there are a few questions I’d like to ask you both. If you don’t mind.\nJANINE: House: double sensor scan rate on the perimeter. Alert me if so much as a leaf falls. —eWe don’t want to be disturbed, do we?\nDOCTOR: No, I suppose not. What I want to know is this:\nMIKEY: When we first met him. How we first met him. The Master.\nDOCTOR: To start with, yes.\nJANINE: OK. It all began the day we got thrown off the bus, on the way back from school...\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 73\nCOLIN: It was all Janine’s fault. She’d been singing “Relax” from the back seat just to wind the bus driver up. Over and over, really loudly. A few miles short of home he flipped, and chucked all four of us out.\nANNIE: Wait a minute. When was this?\nCOLIN: About four o’ clock in the afternoon?\nHELEN: She means the year, Colin.\nCOLIN: “Relax”? — Nineteen eighty-four, obviously.\nANNIE: (INCREDULOUS) Nineteen...\nCOLIN: Great year for music. Frankie, Nena, Nik Kershaw, the Thompson Twins at their peak.\nHELEN: Annie wasn’t even born then, Colin. But to her, we look like teenagers still.\nANNIE: You mean, you’re not?\nCOLIN: We're forty-eight years old! Forty-nine next birthday. Look, do you want us to tell you what happened or not?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: Nineteen eighty-four? But that’s the year I came here from!\nMIKEY: Beginning to remember now — Doctor?\nJANINE: Nineteen eighty-four. The year the Master came.\nMIKEY: The year he ruined all our lives.\nFROM: SCENE 57:\nMASTER: Such good children.

Only Janine got us chucked off the bus.\nJANINE: That driver. Just dumped us, right in the middle of nowhere! Can you believe it? He’d so end up in court now.\nMIKEY: The bus went round the houses — through Crowbrook and the Hodcombes. I said I knew a shortcut home to Hexford, over fields. Be back home sooner than waiting at the bus stop, I thought.\nJANINE: Only you didn’t know the way — did you, Mikey?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 76\nCOLIN: .OSO he says, (YOUNG ONES NEIL) “Have we got a video?” And they all say —\nJANINE: & HELEN & MIKEY: “Yes, we've got a video!”\nCOLIN: You saw it.\nHELEN: Colin, everyone saw it.\nJANINE: (STOPS) Miii-key. Is it much further?\nMIKEY: See that stile, Janine? At the far end of the field? There’s a footpath.\nJANINE: That leads back to the road, does it?\nMIKEY: I think so.\nCOLIN: What’s that mean?\nHELEN: Mikey. You have actually been this way before?\nMIKEY: I’ve got a good sense of direction. Everyone says.\nCOLIN: (SIGH) Just brilliant.\nJANINE: You know what everyone says, Mikey?\nHELEN: Janine, don’t —\nJANINE: What everyone says is you’re a grade-A divvy. A total moron, just like your moron of a [brother]\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: ROOF OF A BARN, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND THEM.\nCOLIN: Whoa! Did you hear that?\nHELEN: The whole ground shook! Like a bomb went off.\nCOLIN: Like the Bomb went off. (BAD AMERICAN) “This is it, boys! This is war!”\nHELEN: (REPROACHFULLY) Col-in.\nJANINE: Can’t have been it. There’d be a mushroom cloud?\nCOLIN: Or some red balloons.\nMIKEY: There’s smoke. — Back the way we came, there!\nCOLIN: Oh, yeah! Past that barn.\nHELEN: In that barn.\nCOLIN: You've got good eyesight.\nJANINE: (CRUEL) Must be the gogs.\nMIKEY: I’m going to see. (SETS OFF)\nCOLIN: What’s to see? Some flaming barn? Literally? — Actually, it might be good. Come on! (FOLLOWS)\nJANINE: Don’t be stupid!\nHELEN: Mikey’s right. Something happened. Someone might need help.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: HEAT. BARN DOOR RATTLES OPEN.\nMIKEY: Hello? — Hello?\nCOLIN: (JOGGING IN) Wait up, Mikey. We’re not all Steve Ovett — (SEEING CAPSULE) Blimey!\nMIKEY: It must have come clean through the roof, look.\nCOLIN: What is it?\nMIKEY: I don’t know. Satellite?\nCOLIN: Satellites have aerials and antennae and stuff.\nMIKEY: Maybe they fell off? (EFFORT AS...)\nCOLIN: It’s smoking hot, whatever it [is] — What are you doing? This whole lot could go up, woof!\nMIKEY: I know, that’s why I’m moving the haybales. (DROPS ONE) You could give us a hand if you like?\nCOLIN: No fear.\nHELEN: (ARRIVING) What is it?\nCOLIN: I don’t know, but no way’s it a satellite.\nHELEN: Maybe it fell out of a plane?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 79\nJANINE: (ARRIVING) Things don’t fall out of planes. Things get dropped out of planes.\nCOLIN: What things?\nJANINE: Think about it. We’re just a few miles from an airbase?\nCOLIN: It’s a bomb. — It’s the Bomb!\nHELEN: Mikey, get away from there!\nMIKEY: If it’s the Bomb, there’s no use running.\nMIKEY: SIMILAR TO SIDRAT-OPENING EFFECT FROM ‘THE WAR GAMES’.\nJANINE: (SQUEALS) It’s moving!\nMIKEY: No it’s not. It’s opening.\nHELEN: Opening?\nMIKEY: Can’t see the top. We need a ladder.\nMASTER: (DEMANDING, FROM INSIDE CAPSULE) Help me!\nJANINE: There’s someone in there!\nMASTER: (APPEARING AT TOP OF CAPSULE) I said, help me!\nCOLIN: (SCREAMS) Aaaah!\nMASTER: (ECHOES HIM) Aaaaaaah! — Cretin. Help me down from here!\nHELEN: He’s burned. He’s been burned.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: The Master.\nMIKEY: We didn’t know that’s who he was. We just thought he needed help.\nJANINE: He looked horrible.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 81\nMASTER: My... capsule has landed upside-down. I need assistance!\nMIKEY: (COMING OVER, CARRYING LADDER) Out of the way, I found a ladder!\nMASTER: So one of you has a rudimentary intelligence.\nMIKEY: (PATTING LADDER) There. — Hold on, I’m coming up.\nMASTER: That will not be necessary.\nCOLIN: It’s closing again.\nMASTER: (CLAMBERING DOWN) That is essential, so the internal reconfiguration process may be- (GASPS IN PAIN, SLIPS) Gaaaah!\nHELEN: Catch him!\nMIKEY: (CATCHES MASTER) Alright, I’ve got you. One more step. Easy does it. There.\nMASTER: (WEAK) Pain. I feel... pain. I need to... to...\nMIKEY: You need a sit-down, that’s what you need.\nHELEN: He needs an ambulance. Janine, you’re fastest. There’s a phone box by the signpost to Hexford. Have you got ten pee?\nJANINE: Yeah, I don’t even know the way?\nMASTER: No! I do not need... medics.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 82\nCOLIN: Mate. Seriously. You’ve not seen your face.\nHELEN: I’1ll go, then!\nMASTER: (WHIPPING OUT GUN FROM UNDER COWL) No medics! Or I will kill you!\nCOLIN: He’s got a gun. A laser gun!\nMASTER: A staser gun. Imbecile!\nCOLIN: Staser?\nMASTER: Yes.\nCOLIN: Not laser?\nCOLIN: & HELEN & JANINE:\nCOLIN: Staser it is, then.\nMASTER: My capsule is damaged. It must repair itself, before it can repair me. Until then.. I’m as mortal as you.\nMIKEY: I can get you emollient cream. For the burns?\nMASTER: These scars were... pre-existing. It’s my genetic structure that’s suffered trauma.\nHELEN: Genetics? Like D.N.A.?\nCOLIN: They did a Q.E.D. about it.\nMASTER: Like D.N.A., yes! — Where is the nearest gene therapy facility?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 83\nJANINE: There’s only the Jeans Machine in big town.\nMASTER: Then take me there!\nJANINE: (SNIGGER) What, to the Jeans Machine?\nCOLIN: It sells denims. She’s having a joke.\nMASTER: A joke. Heh. Very... amusing. (CALMLY) Look into my eyes,\nMASTER: giggler.\nJANINE: (SHRINKING BACK) I don’t want to..!\nMASTER: (COMMANDING) Into my eyes...!\nMASTER: I can make you my puppet. I can make you dance to any tune I like. I can make you climb to the top of this ramshackle building and throw yourself from it, and laugh as you do so. For I am your master, and you will obey me.\nJANINE: You are my master, and I shall obey you.\nJANINE: (RELEASED) Ohhh!\nHELEN: It’s alright, Janine. You’re alright now.\nMASTER: The same applies to all of you. Do you understand?\nMIKEY: What do you want us to do?\nDOCTOR WHO: ...AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 84\nMASTER: Ah, Rudimentary Intelligence. I like you. What is your name?\nMIKEY: Mikey. Michael. Sir.\nMASTER: Tell me, Michael. What is your dearest wish?\nMIKEY: My...?\nMASTER: Your dearest wish. Your feeble beating heart’s desire. Show me! Look into my eyes and show me!\nMASTER: I see it. Yes. You would do anything for this, would you not?\nMIKEY: (MESMERISED) Yes... master.\nMASTER: Then it shall be yours.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 85\nANNIE: He read your minds?\nCOLIN: I don’t know. It was like he made us think that he had. He could make us think anything.\nHELEN: It was all a trick. He used us, Colin. We were children, and he used us.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 86\nCOLIN: Our heart’s desire? Really?\nMASTER: Yours, I think, will be easy to obtain. The giggler’s, too.\nHELEN: Who are you? What are you?\nMIKEY: He’s from space. He’s a spaceman, like E.T.\nCOLIN: Only far more handsome. Right, ‘Master’?\nHELEN: I want to pass Maths. I’1l never be anything if I can’t pass Maths. I’ve been trying and trying but it’s all x, y, z this and hypotenuse that and I’ve been having extra lessons but it’s hard, it’s too hard and I don’t want to let my Dad down [and-]\nMASTER: Then I shall give you your mathematics. I shall put the knowledge in your head. Do you see?\nHELEN: Yes. Yes! I see. (LAUGHS) It’s so easy...!\nMASTER: Laughably easy.\nMASTER: There are certain items I require. To facilitate my recovery, while I wait for my... capsule to repair itself. You will find them and fetch them for me.\nCOLIN: Then we’ll obey you. (TO THE OTHERS) Won’t we?\nMIKEY: & HELEN & JANINE: We will obey you.\nMASTER: Good.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 87\nHELEN: Only — we’ll be missed?\nJANINE: By our families?\nCOLIN: We’re late home already.\nMASTER: Yes, you are little more than children still.\nCOLIN: We can come back on Saturday, though. The day after tomorrow.\nMIKEY: I can come sooner. I can bring food. You’1l need food, won’t you?\nMASTER: Thank you, Michael. That would be most appreciated. You others — you will return on Saturday, when I shall give you... further instructions.\nCOLIN: & HELEN & JANINE: We obey.\nMASTER: My children. What fun we shall have...! (LAUGHS) [LONG & SINISTER]\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: What did he make you do? The Master?\nMIKEY: Little things, at first. Stealing. Just bits and pieces. Electronics, mostly.\nJANINE: It wasn’t thieving, like nicking things. He put his mind in ours, So we could just walk into a shop and tell whoever was behind the counter to give us stuff. Just give it. (MASTERY VOICE) “You will obey.”\nDOCTOR: It was stealing, of course.\nJANINE: No-one got threatened. No-one got hurt.\nDOCTOR: The adolescent mind is particularly pliable. Plus, if his genetic structure had been damaged in the TARDIS crash, his nucleii could have been leaking into the immediate environment.\nJANINE: He got inside us, yes.\nMIKEY: He stole us too, Janine!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 89\nMASTER: Yes. Yes! Just three more neutron amps...! (SWATS FLY) Get away from me, insect!\nPOWERS: DOWN.\nMASTER: (ENRAGED) Gaaah!!! How can I work with such primitive tools?! These are Time Tots’ instruments! (EFFORT; WRENCHES TWO PIECES OF EQUIPMENT APART)\nMIKEY: Master? Master? I got you more cream —\nMIKEY: Careful! That nearly got me on the head.\nMASTER: Then it would have done very little damage!\nMIKEY: (FX: PICKING UP BITS) You’ve been working on that whatever -it- is for days. Now you’1ll have to start all over again.\nMASTER: How many weeks has it been already, trapped in the back end of this cosmic backwater?! My form dissipates by the day!\nMIKEY: Look. I didn’t like to say, but you’re starting to pong a bit. That’s why I bought flypaper.\nMASTER: Fly... paper?\nMIKEY: (EFFORT AS FX: PINS FLYPAPER TO RAFTER) If I just pin it up to this rafter... they won’t bother you so much. See?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 90\nMASTER: (SARCASTICALLY) What a thoughtful boy.\nMIKEY: S*alright,. “Dad”.\nMASTER: “Dad”...?\nMIKEY: No-one else I can say that to. But you know that, right? It’s just me and my big brother, since our Mum... Well, that’s why it’s easier for me to visit you, than it is the others.\nMASTER: Your “big brother” doesn’t mind?\nMIKEY: He doesn’t notice anything much, not since Goose Green. — The Falklands, you know?\nMASTER: Ah. A local conflict.\nMIKEY: He came under bombardment. He got burned, like you. That’s how I knew how to treat you. (FX: UNSCREWS LID OF JAR) Practice. — Where do you want to start today? Arms or legs?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 91\nCOLIN: Poor old Mikey. Dunno what happened to that brother of his.\nHELEN: Perhaps he went to his aunt’s place, in Letchworth?\nANNIE: Letchworth?\nCOLIN: Mikey’s Mum used to go to her sister’s, when his brother’s moods got too much. He used to get angry. Crazy angry. Smash things up. Little brother Mikey was the only one he didn’t get mad at.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 92\nMIKEY: There. Feel any better?\nMASTER: All this may do is delay my physical dissolution. The power supply to this outhouse is wholly inadequate, if I’m to restore myself!\nMIKEY: That capsule of yours is still cooking?\nMASTER: I don’t know when my TARDIS will have fully regenerated.\nMIKEY: Must have been quite a bump you had. In space, I mean.\nMASTER: It wasn’t a “bump”. It was an attack! An ambush, by trans- dimensional warp cruisers! I can see them now, in my mind’s eye. A whole war fleet assembled for the sole purpose of my destruction!\nMASTER: I can hear them, too. (BEAT; ALARMED) I can hear them! They’ve found me! I have to get away!\nMIKEY: Hey, hey, calm down. It’s just the airbase. Tornadoes or Vulcans or something. They fly exercises sometimes, over the plain.\nMASTER: Air... base?\nMIKEY: The American air base. Just up the road, really. Loads of people work there. Helen’s Dad’s in logistics. Colin’s Mum works in the canteen.\nMASTER: This is a nuclear-armed establishment?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 93\nMIKEY: I guess so. There’s a sort of peace camp. Not a very big one. We’re too far out from London for the weekend hippies to bother with.\nMASTER: Dim-witted child, why didn’t you mention this before?!\nMIKEY: It didn’t seem important.\nMASTER: This airbase could hold the means of my salvation!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 94\nCOLIN: Hold up — this is the way?\nHELEN: It looks familiar.\nANNIE: I’m just following the co-ordinates. The site’s registered to an outfit called Brackley Saxover Holdings.\nHELEN: When did you find that out?\nANNIE: Earpiece.\nCOLIN: Spy gear, right.\nHELEN: You’ve been getting updates from M.I. Five? While listening to us? And driving?\nCOLIN: It’s called multi-tasking?\nANNIE: Brackley Saxover is only a subsidiary. There’s a parent company based in Moscow.\nCOLIN: The Russians!\nHELEN: (LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW) I knew it!\nCOLIN: Had to be, didn’t it? After what’s-his-name, Grigor.\nHELEN: No, not that. The road, Colin! I know the road! It’s the road to the old airbase!\nCOLIN: Is it?\nHELEN: I’m not likely to forget.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: BARRIER.\nU.S. SENTRY: Halt! I repeat, halt!\nU.S. SENTRY: (SWAGGERING OVER) Security alert in the main complex. We’ve been instructed to conduct a full search of all vehicles entering and exiting the facility. Switch off the engine and state your name, rank and business, soldier. (BEAT) I said, switch off [your engine and]\nCOLIN: The driver can’t hear you, sentry boy.\nU.S. SENTRY: What the...? Kids...!\nHELEN: No. You will not raise the alarm.\nU.S. SENTRY: (STRUGGLING) I... will... not raise the alarm.\nCOLIN: Good boy. I’m Captain Bodie, my partner here’s Sergeant Doyle. Our friend the Corporal here’s just driving us out of your little old airbase, along with the uranium core from a nuclear missile. We’ve just stolen it, you see.\nHELEN: (REPROACHFULLY) Colin. — That’s alright, isn’t it, soldier?\nU.S. SENTRY: Stolen it. Yes, sir, Sergeant Doyle, sir!\nCOLIN: So run along and raise the barrier, there’s a good boy.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 96\nMASTER: (NOT UNDERSTANDING) ‘Bodie’oand ‘Doyle’?\nCOLIN: “The Professionals”? Trust me, it was hilarious.\nHELEN: It was stupid. A stupid risk.\nJANINE: We got the driver to change the tyres. They’1ll never find where we went. (PROUDLY) That was my idea, master.\nMASTER: (IRRITATED) Good, good.\nJANINE: We can do anything we like, now we’ve got the power. Anything at all.\nMASTER: Anything... (NASTILY) So long as I permit it!\nJANINE: Yes, master.\nMIKEY: Excuse me, master, I was wondering...?\nMASTER: What is it, Michael?\nMIKEY: What do we do with the Corporal now?\nHELEN: The driver, he means.\nCOLIN: We couldn’t drive the thing out of the base ourselves. We haven’t passed our test.\nMASTER: (INCREDULOUS) What do you “do”?\nJANINE: Isn’t it obvious?\nCOLIN: No...\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 97\nMASTER: The driver must go.. ‘AWOL’ is the jargon, I believe.\nJANINE: I’1l do it, master. Let me do it, please.\nMASTER: No!\nCOLIN: I don’t understand.\nHELEN: If the driver disappears... they’1l think he did it. The robbery.\nMASTER: The authorities will be too busy searching for him to look elsewhere. And I have every intention of remaining incognito!\nCOLIN: You mean...\nJANINE: Please, master...!\nMASTER: Quiet! Michael — yours will be the privilege, I think. Take my staser. Here.\nMIKEY: I.. I don’t...\nMASTER: You others — you may dig the hole.\nJANINE: So unfair!\nMASTER: Silence! Michael. Take the staser. Obey me. Obey!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 98\nMIKEY: (v/o)\nMIKEY: My brother killed a man once, at Goose Green. It was night. The only light came from tracer fire. My brother was running up a hill when the other man tumbled down it. Each knocked the wind right out of the other. They lay there for a moment — stunned, I suppose. Then they sat up and looked at each other, and remembered that the other man was the enemy. “Don’t move!” said my brother. “Please, don’t move!” The other man was shouting, too. My brother didn’t understand the words, but he knew they meant the same thing. Don’t move. Please, don’t move. If you move, it means you’re going to shoot. If you’re going to shoot, then I have to shoot. It was only for seconds, but it seemed so much longer. Then my brother realised: any moment now, one of us will move. And it might as well be me. And he looked in the other man’s eyes, and he could see him thinking the same.\nMIKEY: The other man’s rifle jammed, so my brother shot him. Then the bombardment came, and my brother never saw his old face again. When he looked in the mirror and tried to remember what he’d used to look like, the only face that he saw was the face of the other man, the man he’d shot. The face of a man you’ve killed is the only face that you’1ll never forget. That was it. That was what broke the Master’s spell. (FX: DISTANTLY, IN MIKEY’S MIND — A STASER SHOT) The driver’s face, as I shot him with that staser.\nDOCTOR: He didn’t need to do that. The Master.\nJANINE: That was the point. Mikey, you were his favourite. It wasn’t a punishment. It was a gift.\nDOCTOR: Please. — What happened then, Michael? Afterwards, I mean?\nMIKEY: The Master told us he’d need one more night to power up the device he was making. After that, he said, he’d be able to leave. So we were to go there the next evening, so we could get our reward.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 99\nJANINE: Our heart’s desire. We’d come so far, it seemed stupid not to.\nMIKEY: I knew, then, though. I knew he wasn’t going to make my brother better. I wanted to tell someone, but I couldn’t think who.\nDOCTOR: Well, the police?\nMIKEY: Someone I could trust to believe me! I thought: if just one person believes me, really believes me, then whatever happens — I’ll be free.\nJANINE: You told! You told on us!\nDOCTOR: Who did you tell? Mikey?\nMIKEY: Did you ever have a favourite teacher, at school? When you’re\nMIKEY: not clever, and there’s a teacher who’s nice, who can see that you’re trying your best, when no-one else will — that teacher\nMIKEY: means everything. I had a teacher like that, in the third year at Little Hodcombe Primary.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Oh no...\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 100\nMIKEY: Come on, come on...\nMIKEY: (CALLING IN) Miss? Miss Hampden?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, TO SIDE) Can I help you?\nMIKEY: (STARTS) Oh!\nMIKEY: Ow!!!\nDOCTOR: Are you alright?\nMIKEY: (SHAKING FINGERS) One of those snappy letterboxes. Used to have a paper round, should have known better.\nDOCTOR: Quite. As I said.. can I help you?\nMIKEY: Oh. Yeah. I’m looking for Miss Hampden? Lady in the post office said she lived here now.\nDOCTOR: She’s not in, I’m afraid. Can I take a message?\nMIKEY: Who are you, then?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor.\nMIKEY: She’s not ill, is she?\nDOCTOR: No, no. She’s taken some friends of mine out for the day, to see a quarry.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 101\nMIKEY: Doesn’t sound much like of a day out.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Tegan wasn’t terribly impressed. “Busman’s holiday” was the phrase she used, I believe. — They’re sourcing stone. For\nDOCTOR: the church restoration?\nMIKEY: Oh, that. Subsidence, they said.\nDOCTOR: (EVASIVE) Yes. But I needed to stay here to work on my, er, motor, So...\nMIKEY: Oh, you’re out the back. Never mind. Doesn’t matter.\nDOCTOR: You’re sure I can’t take a message?\nMIKEY: No, I just wanted her advice about... exams. O Levels coming up.\nDOCTOR: Right. Well, as I said, she’1ll be back [later on. ]\nSIGNAL: HEARD IN PART TWO.\nDOCTOR: Good heavens.\nMIKEY: Is that your motor, making that noise?\nDOCTOR: It’s a distress signal, yes. Look, would you excuse me?\nMIKEY: Yeah, you go.\nDOCTOR: Good luck, though. With the exams?\nMIKEY: Yeah. Cheers. (WALKS OFF)\nDOCTOR: Exams. Nasty. (SHIVERS, WALKS OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: Michael, I’m so sorry. If I’d have known...\nMIKEY: You were here, all those years ago, looking for the Master.\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand.\nMIKEY: You should have found him! You should have stopped him! Then none of it would have happened!\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t years ago! Not for me.\nMIKEY: What?\nJANINE: He’s a time traveller, divvy. Like the Master.\nDOCTOR: Michael, for me that was yesterday morning. That signal I received was sent by the Master’s TARDIS. That was the signal that summoned me here!\nMIKEY: I was all alone. There was no-one I could trust to tell. No-one I could trust to listen.\nDOCTOR: I’d have listened...!\nMIKEY: All I could do was go back there, like he’d told us.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 104\nMASTER: Perfect! Perfect...!\nCOLIN: Master? What happens now?\nHELEN: Master...?\nJANINE: What do you want us to do...?\nMASTER: Sit still around the neutron lode, children. Obey your master.\nJANINE: Our master knows best.\nMASTER: Ah! Michael. So glad you finally decided to grace us with your presence.\nMIKEY: What?\nJANINE: (SNIGGERS) Master. You sound like a teacher.\nCOLIN: Mikey’s in trouble now...\nMASTER: In, boy, in! — Sit down on the floor with the others. Legs crossed!\nMIKEY: You've got your machine working.\nHELEN: It’s alright, Mikey. The Master’s going to give us our reward now.\nMIKEY: He’s still in your heads, isn’t he? Even after what happened. You still can’t think for yourselves.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 105\nMASTER: Such good children. The sons and daughters I never had...\nMASTER: Now obey me, Michael!!!\nMIKEY: (REELING) Gaah!\nMASTER: Go! Sit in the circle. Be a good boy for Daddy.\nMIKEY: (STRUGGLING) I... am not... your son!\nMIKEY: DISTRACTED, THE HYPNOTIC SOUND CUTS OFF.\nMASTER: That sound..! — Ah! At last! My TARDIS!\nMIKEY: It’s changed. It’s a clock. A grandfather clock!\nMASTER: The outer plasmic shell has repaired itself. (TUTS) It’s defaulted to a former shape. How tedious.\nHELEN: Will you leave us now, Master?\nJANINE: Please don’t leave us!\nMASTER: I have to, I’m afraid. But don’t worry — I shall carry a little of you inside my hearts, always.\nMIKEY: What do you mean?\nMASTER: Michael. My very essence was damaged in the attack. My symbiotic nucleii ripped open. I needed a donor, that’s why I landed my TARDIS here.\nMIKEY: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 106\nMASTER: One of my own kind! My TARDIS had indicated that his TARDIS could be found in the vicinity of this particular space-time location. But when I was locked out of my TARDIS, I was unable to pinpoint his whereabouts. The irony! All this time the Doctor might have been going about his wearyingly virtuous business just a few days and miles away, but he might as well have been in another century, another million light years off.\nMIKEY: (MORE TO SELF) The Doctor...?\nMASTER: And so... I was forced to improvise. It’s what all the best people do.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: The Master came here to find me?!\nMIKEY: It was your fight, not ours. But we were the victims.\nJANINE: What happened to us was all your fault!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 108\nMASTER: Sit in the circle, Michael.\nMIKEY: Why? What are you going to do?\nMASTER: Idiot boy! I’ve been incubating donor nucleii inside the four of you. All this time, they’ve been simmering nicely. Now it’s time to reap what I have sown. The machine in the middle of the circle is designed to extract the donor nucleii, and transfuse them into me. Then, I shall be able to pilot my TARDIS properly, and escape!\nCOLIN: But what about us, master?\nHELEN: Will I pass maths?\nJANINE: Will you make me rich?\nCOLIN: Will all our dreams come true?\nMASTER: Oh, children. It’ll be just like going to sleep. After which: dreams shall be your only reality!\nMIKEY: No. You can’t!\nMASTER: Sit in the circle. Obey me! Obey!\nMIKEY: (SHAMMING) I... obey.\nMASTER: Now, all I have to do is stand in the centre..e(FX: WALKS) Switch my machine to ‘extract’ .. (FX: SWITCH CLICKED; MACHINERY\nSTEPS: UP A GEAR) .. and the process begins.\nHELEN: & JANINE IN TURN.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 109\nCOLIN: then HELEN: then JANINE: (BEGIN TO CRY OUT IN AGONY, ETHEREALLY/ELECRONICALLY EXTENDED,\nCONTINUING THROUGH: )\nMASTER: Like a nice, warm shower. So refreshing..! (IRRITATED REALISATION) But: why are all the jets not working...?\nMIKEY: You’1l get nothing from me, Master. I’ve seen you for what you are. I’m immune!\nMASTER: You rejected the nucleii. No matter. Wait there, boy, I’1ll kill you when I’m finished.\nMIKEY: No, Master! (FX: PRODUCES REAL GUN; COCKS IT) You’re evil. You have to be stopped!\nMASTER: A pea-shooter.\nMIKEY: A Browning! It was my brother’s. In the Falklands, he killed a man to save himself, and it destroyed him. But I’m not killing a man. I’m killing a monster!\nMASTER: Pathetic. Inside the nucleii fountain, I’m immortal!\nMIKEY: Maybe. But the machine isn’t!\nMASTER: (REALISATION) And... immobile. (HORROR) No. No, Michael, you mustn’t!\nSTOP: SCREAMING. MACHINE GOES CRAZY, SCREECHING TO A CRESCENDO.\nMASTER: You're killing Daddy...!\nMASTER: DISSIPATES. TWINKLY FX, LIKE DUST.\nMASTER: COLIN, HELEN & JANINE:\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 110\nMIKEY: Colin? Helen? Janine? Are you alright?\nCOLIN: What happened?\nHELEN: Where is he?\nJANINE: Where’s the Master?\nMIKEY: I killed him. He’s gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 111\nMIKEY: I thought I’d killed the Master, all those years ago. But now he’s come back.\nDOCTOR: Very possibly.\nMIKEY: That’s why I set a trap for him. And he fell right into it — didn’t he, Janine?\nJANINE: I don’t know what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: You kept the clock, didn’t you, Mikey? You faked your own death, and put the clock up for auction, to see who’d buy it.\nMIKEY: I put the clock up for auction, but the death was real. — She knows!\nDOCTOR: What?\nMIKEY: After everything that happened, I had to get away. But I couldn’t take the clock, and I couldn’t risk it getting it into the wrong hands. So I left it with the only person I could trust.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Your brother...!\nMIKEY: All he wanted was to be left alone, away from everyone. Away\nMIKEY: from people and noise, all the things that made him anxious.\nMIKEY: Living out in the woods gave him a mission, you see? In time, everyone had all but forgotten he was there. — Until you came back for him, Janine. You and the Master!\nJANINE: Me?!\nMIKEY: You killed him, you and the Master. The stasers you gave to your goons prove it!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 112\nJANINE: They were the stasers we made for the airbase raid, divvy! We threw them down a well, remember? So I got the boys to dig them\nJANINE: up!\nMIKEY: Then you do admit it!\nDOCTOR: No, it doesn’t make sense. If the Master killed your brother, why not take the clock then?\nMIKEY: Because — (HE’S GOT NO ANSWER) — because...\nJANINE: Exactly. I’m not working for the Master. I’m trying to trap him, just like you!\nDOCTOR: You said he was in your head...\nJANINE: Whatever was inside him — these ‘symbiotic nucleii’uclthey stopped me ageing. Kept me at the age of sixteen!\nDOCTOR: Your friends Helen and Colin too.\nJANINE: You’ve seen them?\nDOCTOR: At the auction house, yes. Mikey —iyou’d already rejected the nucleii, that’s why you aged and the others didn’t!\nJANINE: That’s how it was, for thirty-two years, until three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, he came back. Every time I looked in a mirror, I heard him laughing. (FX: DUB MASTER LAUGHING, FROM SCENE 45) Whenever I tried to sleep, he’d whisper in my ear. I found I had the power again, to make people obey. (FX: DUB OVER MASTER\nFROM: SCENE 59: “OBEY ME! OBEY!”)\nMIKEY: Three weeks ago. That’s when my brother was killed. That’s why I came back.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 113\nJANINE: Me too! So I got together with certain.. business associates, who owned this tax dodge of a mansion on the site of the old airbase. I scoured the area for any sign of him. Then when I saw the clock up for auction, I bought it, thinking he’d be\nJANINE: close behind.\nDOCTOR: (GROANS) That’s why you had the private army. To catch the Master!\nJANINE: Mikey..iwhen I worked out where the clock had come from, I got Grigor to go to the graveyard.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and you exhumed a body.\nMIKEY: She did what?!\nJANINE: I had to know it wasn’t him. The Master. I’m sorry.\nMIKEY: Shut that noise up!\nJANINE: It’s showing a breach at the entrance level.\nMIKEY: Well, what does that mean?!\nDOCTOR: Please, I’m trying to think! Both of you were using the clock to try to draw out the Master. But that still doesn’t answer my question: if the Master killed Mikey’s brother, why not take the clock then?\nMIKEY: You’re the one who knows so much about the Master, you tell us!\nJANINE: Someone’s on the main stairwell.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR: Because the clock was a lure. Because the Master was using to draw you all back together. His so-called children.\nMIKEY: Why?\nDOCTOR: Knowing the Master... revenge.\nJANINE: They’re in the corridor now.\nDOCTOR: Which corridor?\nJANINE: The corridor leading here.\nMIKEY: It’s the Master! It has to be!\nMIKEY: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 115"

Annie, this is the key to the Master’s TARDIS!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 116\nJANINE: Thermal sensors. Doctor, whoever’s coming, they’re right outside!\nDOCTOR: (EXPLOSIVE REALISATION) The key is the key!!!\nMIKEY: Eh?\nDOCTOR: The key to the Master’s TARDIS. Your brother had it, yes?\nMIKEY: Yes, but —\nDOCTOR: That TARDIS has been dormant for thirty-two years. So why should it begin to transmit a distress signal now?\nANNIE: (AT DOOR) Because someone reactivated it.\nJANINE: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Someone put the key in the lock.\nANNIE: (STEPPING IN) And when they did, these two began hearing the voice of the Master.\nDOCTOR: Annie. Of course.\nMIKEY: Your friend’s wrong. I never heard the voice of the Master.\nANNIE: I meant — these two.\nJANINE: Colin. Helen!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 117\nCOLIN: Janine? We heard you’d died!\nJANINE: Long story.\nHELEN: And Mikey. Colin, it’s Mikey! — Mikey, you lost all your hair.\nMIKEY: (PUT OUT) Not all.\nJANINE: Aww, friends reunited. So who’s this we have to thank, for bringing the old gang back together?\nCOLIN: Oh, this is Annie. She’s with M.I. Five.\nDOCTOR: No she isn’t.\nCOLIN: You should have seen how she dealt with the security systems. She’s got like these electronic implants in her fingertips!\nJANINE: She’s got what?!\nCOLIN: It was A.-May.-Zing.\nDOCTOR: (TO ANNIE) Electronic implants. “M.I. Five.” Who are you, really? What are you, even? A cyborg?\nANNIE: Doctor, don’t be silly.\nDOCTOR: The key was the key, you see. Whoever had the key to the Master’s TARDIS reactivated it.\nMIKEY: But whoever did that — [IE, ANNIE KILLED HIS BROTHER]\nDOCTOR: Mikey — this is the key to my TARDIS. Do as I told you, please. Take your friends with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 118\nCOLIN: Cyborg?!\nDOCTOR: Yes, so a staser is no defence. — Go, all of you!\nJANINE: Mikey, Colin, Helen, come on!\nANNIE: (CALLING AFTER THEM) I said, don’t be silly!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS.\nCOLIN: That’s this Doctor’s TARDIS?

Skill!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR: (LOOKING OUT) Ah, some kind of pursuit ship. You’re one of the assassins whom the Dragonhunters mentioned, am I right?\nANNIE: Human personality matrix to “off”. (COLDER FROM HERE) We are the Unholy Protocol, yes.\nDOCTOR: The android Inquisition of Galaxy Five. You’ve burned whole galaxies in the course of your demented Mission!\nANNIE: We are man-made. Therefore we are blasphemy. Therefore we must atone. Were we to bring justice to the Master, we calculate that we would become one-point-seven-six per cent more worthy. That is why we attacked the Master’s TARDIS, and why we pursued its artron trail here.\nDOCTOR: Only you arrived thirty-two years after he did!\nANNIE: Correct.\nDOCTOR: And when you found it, you killed its guardian. Michael’s brother! An innocent man! So much for becoming more worthy.\nANNIE: The necessary adjustments has been included in our calculations. Also adjustments for the deaths of Grigor open- brackets surname unknown close-brackets; the Auctioneer open- brackets name unrecorded close-brackets; and human personality matrix Annie open-brackets surname unknown close-brackets.\nDOCTOR: Good and evil aren’t columns on a.. a balance sheet! You can’t put a figure on life!\nANNIE: But we can. The bounty on the Master’s head will raise a sum in excess of three hundred thousand galactic credits. This will be donated to charity.\nDOCTOR: That’s monstrous!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 121\nROBOT ANNIE: (TANNOY) We repeat, surrender yourselves to our agent!\nMIKEY: They’ve got us pinned down. No way we’ll make it to the TARDIS.\nCOLIN: Alright, what about the helicopter? The MI-8?\nHELEN: Colin, they’1ll just shoot it down!\nJANINE: They might not. Not if they know the Master’s TARDIS is inside.\nHELEN: It is?\nMIKEY: We can’t take the risk.\nJANINE: Old man, live a little! (SHE RUNS OFF)\nCOLIN: Come on, Hel. Run!\nMIKEY: Colin! Helen! Come back!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 122\nANNIE: The human named Mikey thought he’d killed the Master, in nineteen eighty-four. But the essence of the Master remained dormant in his friends.\nDOCTOR: Some of his symbiotic nucleii, yes. So when the Master’s TARDIS was reactivated, when the telepathic circuits inside the Master’s TARDIS were reactivated, so too were those nucleii.\nANNIE: Then the Master isn’t dead. The humans named Colin, Helen and Janine hold the essence of the Master. They are the Master now. Therefore: they must be killed.\nDOCTOR: No! They are human beings!\nANNIE: (INTO EARPIECE) Pursuit ship, are you listening? — Confirmed.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 123\nHELEN: (OUTSIDE) Mikey’s not coming!\nJANINE: Forget him! Just get in the cockpit!\nCOLIN: (OUTSIDE) Janine’s right, Hel!\nCOLIN: AS THEY CLAMBER INTO COCKPIT...\nJANINE: Hurry it up, you two!\nCOLIN: We’re in, we’re in.

Out of the way, two!\nHELEN: you\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: Trans—-human Sister, please, listen to me! The Master came to this region in nineteen eighty-four in search of me, so he could use my nucleii to repair his own shattered form.\nANNIE: That’s of no consequence.\nDOCTOR: Those children were innocent victims, caught up in a fight that was mine and the Master’s. What happened to them is my responsibility!\nMIKEY: (RUNNING IN) Doctor, that spaceship’s about to open fire on the helicopter!\nANNIE: The Master won’t escape us again. He must be destroyed.\nDOCTOR: (DESPERATE) But not in those children! In me!\nANNIE: In... you?\nDOCTOR: I can complete what the Master did not. Extract his nucleii from Colin, Helen and Janine and put them in me. Then by your logic I will be the Master, and you can do as you please with me! — Well? Would that be acceptable to you?\nANNIE: (INTO EARPIECE) Pursuit ship. Protocol chapter nine, verse twenty-two. Execute.\nDOCTOR: No!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 125\nHELEN: (EXCITEDLY) I’ve got the whirly things going!\nCOLIN: Blades!\nJANINE: Quick, that spaceship’s coming over!\nCOLIN: Come on, Hel!

In you, to plus zero-point- nine-three.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s good to know that my death will count for something.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: 71. j%&INT. SPACESHIP — EXECUTION BUBBLE\nCOLIN: Where are we?\nHELEN: On the Trans-humans’ spaceship, obviously.\nCOLIN: I meant specifically. This white — sphere, I guess? No doors, no windows, no ceiling. I can’t see how the floor works. Or if it’s a floor at all.\nJANINE: (CALLING) Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone even listening?\nHELEN: I think it’s a cell.\nCOLIN: Like, a prison cell?\nHELEN: More like a condemned cell, Colin.\nCOLIN: Death Row. Great. What are we supposed to do — pray for a last- minute phone call?\nJANINE: (A THOUGHT) Phone. Phone! Have either of you got a phone?\nHELEN: Janine, we’re on a spaceship. Who are you going to phone?\nCOLIN: E.T.?\nJANINE: My lovely Russian boys, stupid. Artem and... the other one. They might have come round by now.\nHELEN: Janine, what is it with you and these Russians?\nJANINE: What, apart from their being ripped?\nCOLIN: She hasn’t changed.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 128\nJANINE: No. Not in over thirty years. But at least I’ve done something with that, unlike you two.\nCOLIN: What can you do with it?\nHELEN: I’ve watched the world slip away. Our old classmates are nearly fifty now. They had careers, got married, had children. We couldn’t.\nCOLIN: You could, if you’d wanted.\nHELEN: And risk passing on the curse? No. It’s our punishment, for what we did all those years ago. Our penance.\nCOLIN: Saturday jobs, evening jobs, cash in hand, that’s all I’ve done.\nHELEN: Me too. I ended up going back to the same places I’d worked in sixteen years before, only I’d have to pretend I was my own daughter now. If they said they remembered my Mum, I’d have to tell them she’d passed away. “So young,” they’d say. “So sad.” You don’t know the half of it, mate, I’d be thinking.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: THE SHIP.\nMIKEY: (ABOVE NOISE) Are we nearly there yet? I don’t want to look.\nDOCTOR: (ABOVE NOISE) I must admit, I was expecting we’d get to the spaceship by TARDIS, not in a tractor beam...\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 130\nJANINE: Is that it? Is that all the two of you have done in thirty-two years?\nCOLIN: Is this where you tell us about the amazing life you’ve head, and how we should be sooo jealous?\nJANINE: I had a gap decade. Travelling, like Mikey did. I went everywhere. Literally, everywhere. It was always a bit beg, steal and borrow, but I’m pretty, I got away with it. It got tricky with the passport after that.\nHELEN: With the photo, you mean?\nJANINE: So one time I got arrested in Kiev. Long story, doesn’t matter. They accused me of having a doctored passport.\nCOLIN: Which you did.\nJANINE: Yes, of course? Anyway: I was interrogated by the FSB. I told them everything in half an hour. I mean, everything. Guess what? They believed me. Turns out they still had KGB files on the Master, the stuff he used to get up to in the old days you wouldn’t believe. But when they found out I was the living fountain of youth — basically, they bought me.\nHELEN: What, like a slave?\nJANINE: Like a businesswoman! Somewhere in the Urals there’s a top secret facility trying to synthesise what’s in my blood.\nCOLIN: Er, why?\nJANINE: Only a man. — I’m the ultimate beauty product! One injection of me, no-one need ever grow old.\nHELEN: Either that, or they’1ll become the Master.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 131\nJANINE: Don’t worry, the team’s been having no luck. In the meantime, luxury lifestyle! So long as I’ve got my minders around.\nHELEN: Be honest, Janine. You were under house arrest.\nJANINE: Kind of. So when the Master came back, I thought: I can use the powers to find him, catch him and use him to get away.\nCOLIN: In his TARDIS, you mean?\nJANINE: Or by giving him up to the Russians. That’s the least he deserves. — Look, have you got a phone or haven’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 132\nANNIE: Janine can’t call out, of course. Sound waves can’t exit the membrane of the execution bubble. Light waves can’t enter.\nMIKEY: We can see them, but they can’t see us?\nDOCTOR: ‘Execution bubble.’ (TO ANNIE) I presume you’re intending to put me in there, eventually?\nANNIE: The bubble will be quickly deflated. Its dimensions will shrink. Yours... won't.\nDOCTOR: Nasty.\nANNIE: The membrane’s designed so we can’t hear your screams. If we did, we might be tempted to revel in them.\nDOCTOR: Yes, because that would be a sin...\nMIKEY: Two more of them!\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Sister. Which of these is the Time Lord?\nANNIE: The man in white.\nMIKEY: Excuse me — how many of you are there, on this ship?\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Each death squad numbers twelve.\nROBOT: ANNIE #2: Why do you ask?\nMIKEY: I just what to know how many of you I have to kill, for killing my brother.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 133\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Sister, is this human not a threat?\nROBOT: ANNIE #2: Why’s he here? Shouldn’t we kill him?\nDOCTOR: Please, no! (DISSEMBLING) Mikey killed the Master — or tried to kill him, anyway — so the Master will want revenge on him. His presence will help me draw the Master out.\nANNIE: And how will the Master be drawn out, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Ah, well, I’m glad you asked me that. First, I’1ll need access to the Master’s TARDIS.\nANNIE: An obvious trick.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s essential. It was the reactivation of the telepathic circuits in the Master’s TARDIS that caused the reactivation of the nucleii in Colin, Helen and Janine. I need to disable those circuits in order to break the link and free those nucleii.\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Sister, is it a trick?\nANNIE: I’m not sure.\nDOCTOR: A zero-point-zero-five percent gain in worthiness, remember?\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Then we agree.\nANNIE: But I’1ll come with you. If it is a trick, ‘Mikey’ishall suffer summary execution.\nDOCTOR: Won’t that wipe out any gain?\nANNIE: Lying would add sufficient to your sins to mitigate against further loss.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: I see. Lead the way, then.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: IN FLURRY, LIKE BATS [FX FROM EIGHTH DOCTOR AND LUCIE XMAS\nSPECIAL: ‘RELATIVE DIMENSIONS’, SCENE 1 REASK JAMIE ROBERTSON,\nWHO: WAS THE SOUND DESIGNER].\nMIKEY: (AT DOOR) Bats?!\nDOCTOR: Fledershrews [‘FLAY/DER/SHREWS’]. A common TARDIS pest. They’ve had thirty-two years to establish a colony.\nMIKEY: They won’t suck our blood, or anything?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, they’re entirely harmless.\nANNIE: Proceed!\nMIKEY: This room..!\nDOCTOR: Quite. (QUOTING) “It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould..oas if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together.”\nANNIE: I see no feast.\nMIKEY: He’s quoting. “Great Expectations”? Miss Havisham’s house?\nDOCTOR: Very good.\nMIKEY: It was one of our O Level books.\nANNIE: These telepathic circuits. Where are they located?\nDOCTOR: In the central console.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 136\nMIKEY: Where?\nDOCTOR: Here. (BLOWS COBWEBS AWAY) “So heavily overhung with cobwebs\nDOCTOR: that its form was quite undistinguishable.”\nMIKEY: There’s a red light here —\nDOCTOR: (SHARPLY) Don’t touch that, please.\nANNIE: That is the circuit in question?\nDOCTOR: It is, [yes.]\nMIKEY: Did either of you hear — ?\nMIKEY: There it is again!\nANNIE: The Master.\nMIKEY: But he’s dead. Physically, I mean.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMIKEY: So —owhat? He’s a ghost now?\nDOCTOR: In a manner of speaking.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 137\nANNIE: He haunts this place?\nDOCTOR: (ADDRESSING THE ROOM —AIE, MASTER) Will you stop that, please?! Just — show yourself.\nMIKEY: What was [that?]\nDOCTOR: Don’t be alarmed, it’s just the scanner. Look.\nMASTER: (D: OVER SCANNER) Doctor. Always spoiling my sport. You’re just no fun anymore!

I don’t suppose you’ve got any spares?\nANNIE: How can this creature be communicating with us?\nMIKEY: And what does he mean, ‘three weeks late’?\nMASTER: (D) Oh look, it’s Mikey. Dear, dear Mikey. Such a good boy. My sincerest condolences for the loss of your brother.\nMIKEY: (RUSHING FORWARD) Oh, I’11 enjoy killing you again!\nDOCTOR: I told you, Mikey, don’t touch the console. — He’s just toying with you. Trying to provoke a response.\nMASTER: (D) Like a cat batting a mouse round the head. I’1l get bored. Eventually.\nANNIE: One of you, answer my question!\nDOCTOR: He’s communicating with us because he’s taken up residence inside the telepathic circuits themselves. I presume his consciousness fled here when his body dissipated entirely, all those years ago, in the barn.\nMIKEY: He’s been stuck in here for thirty-two years?\nMASTER: (D) It has been... particularly tedious.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: His TARDIS would have gone into sleep mode, to preserve its power supply. But then Annie- the Trans-human assassin, I mean — found it and reactivated it, using the key.\nMASTER: (D) Whereupon I sent out a distress call to the Doctor, whom I knew had been in the area, thirty-two years in the past. And here he is. My brave white knight, come to my rescue. At last.\nDOCTOR: Don’t count on it. Mikey — if it hadn’t been for that signal, I hope I’d have made the time to listen to you properly. Back in Little Hodcombe, in nineteen eighty-four.\nMIKEY: It’s not your fault, Doctor. I get that now. Perhaps... if I'd been more trusting...\nMASTER: (D) There, there. No sense crying over spilt milk, Mikey! — I’ll excuse your lateness, Doctor. But now, I need a new body. Yours!\nANNIE: Yes, so you may be slain, at last!\nHYDRAULIC: FLUID.\nROBOT: ANNIE #1: Sister..! Sister..!

But don’t\nDOCTOR: touch anything! — I’1l be back.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 144\nROBOT: ANNIE #2: (FLAILING ABOUT, STATICKY NOISES) Ssszzztop..sssszzztop!\nGOMPHUS: The assassins’ brains are electronically engineered. Their knowledge may be taken.\nGOMPHUS: Well, Jade Nymph?\nJADE NYMPH: The Master’s essence is contained inside three humans. The humans inside that execution bubble...!\nGOMPHUS: Then all three must be slain.\nJADE NYMPH: (FX: HOVERING OVER) I now understand how the bubble may be manipulated...\nGOMPHUS: No, my novice. I shall execute them personally, as the final act of my month-long life.\nJADE NYMPH: As you wish, Dragonmaster.\nPOPS: —XTWINKLY SOUNDS —WDISGORGING COLIN, HELEN AND JANINE.\nCOLIN: Wha-? We’re free! Hel, we’re —\nHELEN: Er, Colin...\nGOMPHUS: Silence, Masters!\nCOLIN: Oh great. You lot again.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 145\nJANINE: We’re dead.\nGOMPHUS: Like that of the Plutonian pufferfish, I fear the Master’s consciousness may be too toxic for safe consumption. So I shall Simply tear off each of their heads in turn.\nJADE NYMPH: It shall be my honour to watch.\nGOMPHUS: The male first, I think —\nCOLIN: Please, I’m not the Master! Really, I’m not...!\nJADE NYMPH: Dragonhunter? What-?\nANNIE: (STRIDING IN) Odonotan filth.\nJADE NYMPH: You! You have murdered the great Dragonmaster Gomphus, denying\nJADE NYMPH: him the greatest moment of his life...!\nANNIE: And you, yours.\nJADE NYMPH: Now I will never know if I passed my initiation... (DIES)\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 146\nMASTER: (D) Just you and me now, Mikey. Just like old times. You were always my favourite, you know.\nMIKEY: I only wish I’d killed you properly. For the things we did. For the things you made us do!\nMASTER: (D) I know you, Mikey. You’re a good boy. Secretly — you’re\nMASTER: glad you failed to kill me. You’re just like the Doctor. The preservation of your fatuous moral code is more important to you than ending life!\nMIKEY: Shut up! Trying to provoke me.\nMASTER: (D) There’s the telepathic circuit. That red light, right in front of your eyes? That’s where I am now, Mikey. You could just reach out.. rip it out.. and destroy me. If you had the nerve. But you don’t.\nMIKEY: Reach out? Rip it out...?\nMASTER: (D) How pitiful you are. How pathetic.\nMIKEY: (DECIDES) Destroy you. (LUNGES FORWARD TO CONSOLE) Yes!\nMIKEY: FACE IN ‘THE KEEPER OF TRAKEN’ PART FOUR.\nMIKEY: Aaaah! I can’t — move!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 147\nHELEN: Look at this place. What happened here...?\nANNIE: These creatures slaughtered every last one of my Sisters.\nCOLIN: Just as well you came along when you did. Do you know what they were about to do?\nANNIE: Exactly what I’m about to do.\nJANINE: Oh, no.\nHELEN: Out of what? Spite?\nANNIE: Because I am programmed to believe that such virtue will not go unrewarded.\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING IN FROM OFF) No! —RSister, please, listen to me! Your calculations are incorrect!\nANNIE: Explain!\nDOCTOR: You saw for yourself. The Master resides within the telepathic circuits of his own TARDIS. His essence is not inside these children, only his symbiotic nucleii! They’ve done nothing wrong!\nANNIE: Even if that were true...\nDOCTOR: It is!\nANNIE: They stole for him. They hijacked a nuclear device for him. They were party to a murder orchestrated by him.\nHELEN: We couldn’t stop ourselves!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 148\nANNIE: In fact, were I to kill them and the Master, too.. I calculate would make myself more virtuous than I initially estimated!\nJANINE: But we’re innocent.\nANNIE: No-one is innocent!\nANNIE: NB: FROM HERE, THE MASTER IS WEARING MIKEY’S BODY.\nMIKEY: (APPROACHING OFF) I couldn’t have put it better myself.\nDOCTOR: Mikey...?\nANNIE: You..ocannot hope to destroy me with a pistol shot!\nMIKEY: Not one shot, no.\nDOCTOR: That was entirely gratuitous!\nMIKEY: A staser would have been useless against it. But despite its primitive design... an Army issue pistol makes for a pleasingly blunt instrument.\nDOCTOR: You should know. You fell victim to the exact same weapon before.\nMASTER: I’1ll recover my T.C.E. in due course.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 149\nCOLIN: Mikey, mate... your skin’s going all kind of.. flakey.\nHELEN: Not just his skin. Look at his eyes...\nDOCTOR: Don’t look at his eyes!\nJANINE: His eyes...\nMIKEY: That’s right... children. Look into my eyes. You know me.\nCOLIN: You are our master.\nHELEN: We must obey you.\nDOCTOR: I warned Mikey not to touch the console.\nMIKEY: Children just won’t be told, will they?\nDOCTOR: That human body won’t last, you know. Already it’s becoming corrupted. Rotting from the inside out!\nMIKEY: Yes. I’m beginning to feel — (COUGHS; CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me.\nDOCTOR: Are you quite alright?\nDOCTOR: NB: NOW THE MASTER HAS HIS OLD VOICE BACK.\nMASTER: (FINISHES CLEARING THROAT) There. I’m beginning to feel my old self again. But never fear, Doctor: I’ve no intention of retaining this cadaverous form. Not when your body’s mine for the taking!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: Leaving that one behind, like a shed snakeskin. That’d get the assassins off your back, I suppose.\nMASTER: That would be a bonus!\nDOCTOR: I’m curious: who was it exactly, who put the price on your head in the first place?\nMASTER: That is none of your concern. Children —\nMASTER: COLIN, HELEN & JANINE: Yes, master.\nMASTER: Bring the Doctor. We’ll do the exchange in my TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 151\nCOLIN: Come along, Doctor.\nHELEN: Don’t struggle.\nJANINE: You must obey your master.\nDOCTOR: Colin, Helen, Janine — listen to me. You can break his control, just like Mikey did. Break his control and the nucleii inside you will shrivel and die. Your minds will be your own again. Yes, and your bodies, too!\nMASTER: They’re not listening, “old chum”.\nDOCTOR: (TO KIDS) Remember Mikey? Your friend, Mikey? He told me how\nDOCTOR: he'd rejected the nucleii, once he’d realised that the Master could never make his brother better. That he’d never get his\nDOCTOR: heart’s desire!\nMASTER: Ignore him, children...!\nHELEN: (STOPPING) Our heart’s desire...\nMASTER: Ignore him and proceed!\nDOCTOR: What was it the Master promised each of you? Can you even remember?\nMASTER: Quiet, Doctor! I’d tell them to tear out your tongue if I didn’t intend to use it myself!\nJANINE: He told me he could make me rich. But the rich he made me was a prison.\nDOCTOR: Exactly!\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL)\nHELEN: Page 152\nHELEN: He told me he could make me pass Maths. But all I got was\nHELEN: ‘Ungraded’.\nCOLIN: He told me he could make Helen like looked at me.\nDOCTOR: me. But she never even\nDOCTOR: None of these things were his to give. They were in your power,\nDOCTOR: all along. If you want those things to reject him!\nCOLIN: Our power...?\nDOCTOR: still — use your own power\nDOCTOR: Yes, yours! — Please, let me go, and I’1ll show you.\nHELEN: Let you go...?\nCOLIN: Yes. Let him go.\nDOCTOR: (RELEASED) Thank you.\nMASTER: Remember, children — Mikey rejected\nMASTER: him...!\nCOLIN: Yes, we remember Mikey.\nHELEN: Mikey was our friend.\nJANINE: And you killed him..!\nMASTER: me. And look where it got\nMASTER: You are my puppets! You will obey me!\nCOLIN: No.\nHELEN: We have the power, inside ourselves.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 153\nJANINE: You will obey us!\nMASTER: (REELS FROM HYPNOTIC BARRAGE) Remember — your hearts’ desire! Your dearest wish!\nHELEN: All we wish is we’d never met you!\nCOLIN: All we wish is for you to die!\nJANINE: We can make him die. If we want.\nJANINE: COLIN, HELEN & JANINE: We have the power!\nMASTER: (COLLAPSES UNDER THE HYPNO BARRAGE) No. No! You must... obey me!\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING IN) Please, stop!\nCOLIN: Get out of the way, Doctor.\nHELEN: We don’t want to have to kill you, too.\nDOCTOR: Your friend Mikey told me that when his brother killed a man, in the Falklands, all he did was kill himself. This isn’t what Mikey would want...!\nMASTER: (RECOVERING) Thank you, dear Doctor. (RUNS) For such a timely\nMASTER: intervention!\nJANINE: He’s getting away!\nHELEN: The Doctor’s right, Janine. Letting him go is the only way for\nHELEN: us to escape.\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 154\nCOLIN: There she goes. Back to — where did you say, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ve programmed the autopilot for her place of origin, in Galaxy Five. Hopefully it’1ll send a message.\nJANINE: “Don’t mess with the Master.”\nDOCTOR: I was thinking more along the lines of something about the wages of sin?\nCOLIN: He got away with it, though. The Master.\nDOCTOR: It sometimes seems to me that where the Master is concerned, whenever I win, I lose; whenever he loses, he wins.\nHELEN: I don’t follow.\nDOCTOR: I know where he’s going, eventually. I’ve already met him in that form, in his future. Only a madman would risk disrupting their own personal timeline.\nJANINE: So we’re free of him now?\nDOCTOR: The symbiotic nuclei in your bodies are already beginning to atrophy. I should warn you, though, there’ll be a side-effect.\nCOLIN: We'll start ageing again.\nDOCTOR: Quite rapidly, even.\nHELEN: Colin’s getting a touch of grey already.\nCOLIN: What, seriously?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: Now, if you’ll excuse me — I have to go back to collect my friends.\nJANINE: Please, Doctor. Take us with you. Take us back to nineteen eighty-four.\nDOCTOR: Janine. What did I just say, about risking disruption to one’s personal timeline?\nJANINE: Please, Doctor. I can’t stay here.\nCOLIN: She’s got Russian trouble.\nDOCTOR: Has she? — Well, she’d best talk to UNIT.\nJANINE: What’s UNIT?\nHELEN: (LOOKING OUT) Doctor — there’s a convoy of military vehicles, coming down the drive!\nDOCTOR: (LOOKING) Yes, that’s UNIT. The spaceship was bound to have attracted their attention. Tell them the truth, you’1l be believed. — Now, as I said: I really must be off.\nJANINE: Wait. You can’t just leave!\nCOLIN: He can. And he has. Back to nineteen eighty-four. Classic year, nineteen eighty-four. Brilliant music. Best year of my life, nineteen eighty-four. Well, ‘til it all went wrong. Shame we can’t go back, though, and start all over again.\nHELEN: Well, we can’t. So we start again now. We make these the best years of our lives — agreed?\nDOCTOR WHO: ..AND YOU WILL OBEY ME (FINAL) Page 156\nCOLIN: Agreed. (BEAT) Hel, you’re holding my hand.\nHELEN: I know. Relax.\nHELEN: THE END"
