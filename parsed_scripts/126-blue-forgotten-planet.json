So listen carefully and feel free to get very, very excited.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: FOOTSTEPS OF DOCTOR AND CHARLEY APPROACH ON SAND. THEY COME TO A HALT.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: [AWE] Oh my God...\nDOCTOR WHO: PAUSE. THE EERIE WIND WHIPS AROUND A BIT.\nDOCTOR: I wonder what caused it.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Must be a few miles across...\nDOCTOR: And relatively recent, I’d say.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : How recent?\nDOCTOR: Ooh, within a decade... or so. But what makes a crater this big? Can’t be a meteorite impact. Not unless we’re in the middle of an impact winter... and the sky’s too clear for that.. And although it’s fairly cold, it’s not that cold.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Um?\nDOCTOR: I think it was some sort of chemical explosion.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Have you noticed—?\nDOCTOR: [FRUSTRATED, TO HIMSELF ] Where are we? I don’t recognize this.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : So, definitely not Earth, then?\nDOCTOR: Probably not. What were you asking me?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Oh... over there in the woods, look. Fires.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 16\nDOCTOR: Fires? And they’re moving.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Coming towards us.. What’s going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: HUM OF MONITORS.\nDAVID: So, come on, Sergeant. Tell me.\nATHERTON: Ah, Ellen hasn’t told you yet, then?\nDAVID: Told me what? No, she hasn’t, evidently! She snuck off somewhere during my sat-link. So?\nATHERTON: Er.. well, there’s something a bit more urgent I’d like you to have a look at.\nDAVID: More urgent than what?\nDAVID: FLICK OF SWITCHES. SCREEN BLEEPS.\nATHERTON: See that?\nDAVID: It’s... a satellite image of the Solent Basin, isn’t it?\nATHERTON: That’s right, sir. Just a few miles south of here. Live image. Thought I’d make use of our alignment time. Now, if we zoom ina bit.\nDAVID: What am I looking for?\nATHERTON: I told you we had patrols out, didn’t I?\nDAVID: You did, yes.\nATHERTON: They’ve reported quite a bit of movement. And now... see, Foresters heading south into the basin, towards the Fawley Crater.\nDAVID: What would they be—? [doing that for?]\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 18\nATHERTON: No idea. That’s why I ordered the satellite view. But you see here... a whole party of them, flaming torches and all.\nDAVID: Heading towards... what’s that? A shed or something?\nATHERTON: Dunno. But someone put it there tonight.\nDAVID: Foresters?\nATHERTON: I don’t think so. But maybe... [AS HE ADJUSTS THE VIEW]\nATHERTON: ZOOMING IN SOUND.\nDAVID: Who are they?\nATHERTON: No idea. Only two of them so far, man and woman, and they’re wandering around like lost sheep. But if they’re foreigners, I don’t fancy their chances if Driscoll’s lot get hold of them.\nDAVID: Get the helicopter fired up.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 19\nDOCTOR: A torchlight parade?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I’m counting well over a hundred of them...\nDOCTOR: Not a pleasant image either... I’m thinking ‘Burn the witch’?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Great.\nDRISCOLL: [AGGRESSIVE, SHOUTING FROM QUITE A WAY OFF] Who are you? What you here?\nDRISCOLL: MILA/CHARLEY : [SOTTO] Not sounding very friendly, is he?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] We’ll never make it back to the TARDIS. They could easily cut us off. So let’s just be polite. [SHOUTING] Er... I’m afraid we’ve lost our way. Perhaps you could help!?!\nDRISCOLL: You from compound?!?\nDRISCOLL: MILA/CHARLEY: [SOTTO] Now is that a good or a bad thing?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Good question.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [SOTTO, URGENT] Doctor, they’re coming over.\nFOOSTEPS: APPROACH. WE NOW HEAR THE BURNING OF THE TORCHES.\nDRISCOLL: [CLOSER NOW] This our place! You not one of us! You come down in copter with Callister?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] All right, getting a bit tricky now.\nDISTANT: SOUND OF HELICOPTER.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY: [SOTTO] Listen. What’s that?\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Sounds like a helicopter.\nDRISCOLL: Answer me! You from ‘cross Channel then?\nDRISCOLL: MILA/CHARLEY : [SOTTO] I get the feeling there’s not going to be right answer.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] That helicopter’s getting closer.\nFORESTER: [DISTANT] Look! Up there!\nCOMMOTION: AMONGST THE FORESTERS.\nDRISCOLL: Take ‘em! Take ‘em now!\nDRISCOLL: AGGRESSIVE, MASSED CRIES AS THE BAND OF FORESTERS FORWARD.\nDOCTOR: Run, Charley! Run!\nDOCTOR: THE HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN. THE DEAFENING SOUND OF\nENGINES: COMPETING WITH THE SOUNDS FROM THE CROWD. WIND. DUST WHIPPED UP.\nENGINES: THE DOCTOR AND CHARLEY ARE GRABBED. THROUGH THE\nCACOPHONY: WE HEAR...\nDOCTOR: Argh! Get off me! Ugh!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : No! You get your filthy hands— Argh! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Leave her alone! I’m sure this can all be—\nDOCTOR: A LOUD HAILER CLICKS ON WITH A WHINE OF FEEDBACK.\nDOCTOR: Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.

Come on!\nDRISCOLL: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor!!!\nDRISCOLL: MACHINE-GUN FIRE, A COUPLE OF CONTROLLED BURSTS. IMPACTS ON ROCK AND SAND.\nDRISCOLL: SCREAMS OF ALARM FROM THE CROWD. THEN THE CROWD NOISES\nSURGE: OFF TO ONE SIDE.\nDOCTOR: [MOVED OFF DISTINCTLY TO THE SAME SIDE OF THE STEREO\nFIELD: AS THE CROWD] Charlotte!!!

Back to forest. Torches out! Move it!\nDRISCOLL: IN BACKGROUND, THE HELICOPTER RISES.\nDOCTOR: I think they’ve taken Charley.\nDRISCOLL: Your friend? Taken her right enough.\nDOCTOR: Is that good or bad?\nDRISCOLL: Bad.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nDISCOLL: Get moving!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 23\nDAVID: [FLABBERGHASTED] So what are you telling me, Ellen? You mean you let them into the compound?\nELLEN: No.. I mean, not them, just... It’s just that—\nDAVID: Oh... of course, Ed Driscoll! You just let him in and surprise-surprise all his mates came with him? Is that it?\nELLEN: I... Look, he said—\nDAVID: What? That he still loves you? That he wanted a tender moment? Just to hold hands? I mean, what? Are you really that naive, Ellen? [BEAT] Sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just that...\nDAVID: PAUSE. Don’t I mean anything to you?\nELLEN: He was the father of my daughter, David!\nDAVID: I know that, but—\nELLEN: I can’t just switch off from that! She died out there! Living with the Foresters. Exposed to the elements, grubbing around for food, while we were here, living a privileged life with medical supplies and—\nDAVID: Didn’t Atherton and his people try to stop them?\nELLEN: There were too many. It would’ve been a blood bath. Or would you’ve preferred it if I’d let Atherton hit the button and blow us all up? [BEAT] So we let them take the stuff and go.\nDAVID: How much did they take?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 24\nELLEN: As.. as much as they could carry.\nDAVID: God, Ellen. You know supplies of the vaccine are limited. Do we have any of it left? [CLEARLY NOT.\nDAVID: HE SIGHES] What a mess. Why the hell didn’t you tell me this earlier?\nELLEN: [LOADED] I didn’t think your ‘chums’ would be too happy.\nDAVID: We don’t keep secrets from them, Ellen. We’re working with them! And they’re working with us.\nELLEN: Are they?\nDAVID: Oh, now come on! This is Driscoll’s nonsense, isn’t it? Why the hell would you listen to—?\nHELICOPTER: DESCENDING OUTSIDE.\nHELICOPTER: That’ll be the sergeant and his team. Right, you stay here.\nELLEN: What are you going to do about Ed? If you tell them, they’1l punish us!\nDAVID: Wha— ? I don’t believe I’m hearing this. Of course I’m going to tell the Viyrans.\nHELICOPTER: COMPLETING ITS DESCENT.

His bark could be worse than his bite. I wonder if that applies to you. Perhaps we could be friends.\nTENT: FLAP IS PULLED BACK.\nDRISCOLL: [ENTERING] Bess knows who master is. Don’t stand no nonsense. Have your leg off.\nDOCTOR: Charming.\nDRISCOLL: You know me?\nDOCTOR: Er.. I’m not sure what you—?\nDRISCOLL: All folks here knows me. You don’t know me, you not from here.\nDOCTOR: [CHARMING] Impeccable reasoning, Mr... ?\nDRISCOLL: You speaks the tongue, but like Callister and Compounders. Them who makes pictures.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 28\nDOCTOR: Pictures? Those were the people in the helicopter? The ones who took Charley?\nDRISCOLL: [THREAT] I do askin’. What they call you?\nDOCTOR: Er... the Doctor.\nDRISCOLL: ‘Doctor’? Were doctors. Before Bad Times.\nDOCTOR: Bad Times?\nDRISCOLL: We took their stuff. No good to us. Don’t make no sense.\nDOCTOR: Um... what stuff did you take?\nDRISCOLL: [SUDDENLY VIOLENTLY ANGRY] I told you, I’m askin’, not you!\nDOCTOR: Sorry... sorry. Ask away.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDRISCOLL: Clever man... I see that. You with Callister’s lot in compound?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not. Is—? Sorry, you go on asking.\nDRISCOLL: You don’t sound foreign. So you not from ‘cross channel.\nDOCTOR: Channel? No, I’m not from... across the channel.\nDRISCOLL: Where from, then?\nDOCTOR: Well... I... I’m lost.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 29\nDRISCOLL: Lost? From up north?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know where I am.\nDRISCOLL: SUDDENLY GRABS THE DOCTOR. BESS IS GROWLING.\nDOCTOR: Ugh— now, there’s no need to get excited—\nDRISCOLL: If you clever. You could help.\nDOCTOR: Very possibly.\nDOCTOR: HE’S LET GO. Thank you. How can I help?

I’m sure he’1ll speak to you soon.\nTYPING: CONTINUES.\nTYPING: MILA/CHARLEY : Oh. Sorry. Er... there is just one thing I’d like to ask, though.\nTYPING: STOPS.\nELLEN: [SIGHES, IMPATIENTLY] What?\nELLEN: MILA/CHARLEY: Is this... Earth?\nELLEN: What?\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDAVID: [ENTERING] You can’t let that happen again, Atherton.\nATHERTON: [ENTERING] That’s why I sent out the patrols, sir. Advance warning, you see. And I’ve got those charges in place. Mind you, nothing much I can do if a member of your staff decides to let Driscoll in. [POINTEDLY] Anything you might want to do about that, Mr McCallister?\nDAVID: All right, Sergeant, point taken. Now, Charlotte Pollard...\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Yes—?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 31\nELLEN: [TERSE] She asked if this was Earth. Excuse me, I’ve got some editing to do.\nCHAIR: SCRAPES AND SHE LEAVES. DOOR CLOSING BEHIND HER.\nDAVID: ‘Earth’?\nCHARLEY: I sense a little tension in the air.\nATHERTON: Well you might.

Are you... a space traveller?\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Er... why would you think that?\nDAVID: Why else wouldn’t you know what planet this was?\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY : Good point. [DIVERTING] What’s that you’ve got there?\nDAVID: BURBLE OF BIO-SCANNER.\nDAVID: It’s a bio-scanner.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: And you’re scanning me?\nDAVID: I am.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Why?\nDAVID: Because you’re a mystery.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR WHO: All right, all right! [IN NEARLY ONE BREATH] The Doctor and I landed here earlier this morning, when it was still dark, but his instruments were on the blink, so we didn’t know where we were.

The Doctor.\nCHARLEY: PAUSE.\nCHARLEY: Come on. That’s why I agreed to help you. Why I went on those ‘little missions’ for you. So? Have you? Have you found him?\nVIYRAN: We have received a cellular scan from the planet we are orbiting. We may need to conduct tests on non-cryogenic tissue.\nCHARLEY: Oh, now come on, you promised me—\nVIYRAN: Observe the scan.\nVIYRAN: READ-OUT, ANIMATED GRAPHICS SOUND.\nCHARLEY: Look, I’ve told you before that I don’t understand your hieroglyphics—\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nVIYRAN: Observe the second scan.\nCHARLEY: First, second, it’s all Greek to me.\nVIYRAN: The second is a cellular scan of you.\nCHARLEY: How interesting! What am I supposed— ?[STOPS IN TRACKS] Oh. It’s the same. It’s a copy of me.\nVIYRAN: Precisely. Your double.\nCHARLEY: [ANGRY] Mila!\nHER: Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY : So what do these scans of me say?\nDAVID: I’ve no idea.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Oh. Why not?\nDAVID: We transmit the results for analysis.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY : Transmit? Where to?\nDAVID: Into orbit.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY : You've got spaceships in orbit?\nDAVID: Not us, no. Friends of ours. Aliens who came to help us.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDAVID: Really? Oh. By the way, if this is Earth...

Either you use the correct opening code number or...\nDOCTOR: RUSTLE OF POCKETS.\nBESS: GROWS.\nDRISCOLL: Hey! What you got in pockets?\nDOCTOR: No need to panic. I think I might have a mergin nut. Very helpful for shorting things out.\nDRISCOLL: Stop clever talk.\nDOCTOR: [PUTS IT SIMPLY] I’m finding something that will open these cases. All right? Calm down, Bess.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDRISCOLL: Okay. Quiet, Bess!\nBESS: MAKES A FEW CHASTISED NOISES.\nDOCTOR: Ah! Got it.

Give me injection.\nDOCTOR: I hardly think that’s wise—\nBESS: GROWLS.\nDRISCOLL: Wanna think again?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDAVID: For a long time, nobody knew anything—\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: ‘Anything’ ?\nDAVID: . until the Viyrans came.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: The...

Er.. you seem somewhat changed.\nDRISCOLL: It’s the drug. We took it from the Compound.\nDOCTOR: If that’s where this ship is landing, I’ve got to get to this compound, I have a friend there.

So listen carefully and feel free to get very, very excited.\nDAVID: I want to thank you all for the wonderful footage you’ve been getting. And you’ve all been following the brief perfectly. It’s just what we want. Real human faces... The faces of all those people out there less fortunate than we lucky few.. And you know what? We want more. We want every human face. Because the Viyrans tell me that, when the people back on their home planet look into the eyes of every human being on this Earth... well, they won’t be able to hold back the vital supplies and funding we need any longer.\nDAVID: So, get out there! All of you! Get to work! And with luck... we will no longer be... the Blue Forgotten Planet.\nDAVID: CRASH IN OPENING THEME.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.

I don’t have a twin!\nELLEN: This is weird. This is seriously weird. I don’t like it, David.

The other Ch—\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 54\nCHARLEY: I don’t know. The Viyrans don’t seem to be releasing control on her. She’s staying in her pod.

Why?\nCHARLEY: Because that’s who she is.\nDAVID: But she said... she said she was Charlotte Pollard.\nCHARLEY: I bet she did.\nDAVID: Then... who are you?\nCHARLEY: I’m the real Charlotte Pollard.

None of the humans were harmed.\nDAVID: I see. Sorry... I.. I trust you, of course. I’m sorry. You’ve done a lot for us. You know I’m extremely grateful. My friends down there... well, they’re apprehensive, and as I said, there was an incident with the meds.\nVIYRAN: What incident?\nVIYRAN: A SCANNING SOUND.\nDAVID: [NERVOUSLY OVER-EXPLAINING] One of the local group of survivors... he’s an ex-partner of one of our group... Ellen. He was the father of her child.. the child died. His name’s Driscoll, he’s quite a determined man. Despite everything, he remembers the emotional attachment and it makes him angry. He stirs up a lot of trouble... and while I was away, liaising with the other bases, he and his group stole—\nCHARLEY: Er, David, I don’t think they’re listening.\nDAVID: Oh, but... I see.\nCHARLEY: Trust me, the Viyrans are pretty single-minded about\nCHARLEY: their work.

The guard house?\nELLEN: Maintenance hut... for copter.\nDOCTOR: Mmm, I see.\nDRISCOLL: Wherever he’s put us... we have to get out fast.\nELLEN: You serious? Better off in here. Looked like he might\nELLEN: kill.\nDRISCOLL: That’s nothing to what the Foresters will do when they\nDRISCOLL: discover I’m gone.\nDOCTOR: Your people... in the woods?\nDRISCOLL: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Page 59\nDOCTOR: And they’1l come looking for you here. Atherton and his\nDOCTOR: people will react and—\nELLEN: Bloodbath.\nDRISCOLL: Thirty-odd people with automatic weapons against a\nDRISCOLL: mindless, angry, hungry mob of a few thousand...\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid you’re right, Ellen.

And?\nVIYRAN: It will take some time to process the results fully.\nDAVID: What do you hope to find out?\nVIYRAN: That does not concern you, David.\nDAVID: I... see.\nSCANNING: STOPS.\nVIYRAN: Your concern is the Blue Forgotten Planet Project. How is that proceeding?\nDAVID: Er.. well. Very well, I think. You got those initial transmissions of the footage?\nVIYRAN: Yes.\nDAVID: I thought there were some great shots. What did you think?\nVIYRAN: Yes. The shots were.. great. We.. liked them.\nDAVID: Good... good.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 61\nVIYRAN: When will there be more?\nDAVID: Well... er.. soon. Yes, soon. I’ve given all the groups worldwide the go-ahead, So... So...\nVIYRAN: Thank you, David. We appreciate your help.\nVIYRAN: THE VIYRANS MOVE OFF AND LEAVE, DOOR CLOSING BEHIND THEM.\nDAVID: [THEY'VE GONE] Oh... well.. thanks.\nCHARLEY: That ‘personal touch’ never seems quite real, does it?\nDAVID: They’re alien... I’ve always tried not to judge them by human standards. And they’ve helped us... saved us.\nCHARLEY: [A LITTLE DUBIOUS] Yes... yes, I suppose they have.\nDAVID: How long have you known them... the Viyrans?\nCHARLEY: Known them? I hardly think I know them at all... but they tell me I’ve been on this ship for several millennia.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.

Tell me about this medication supplied by the Viyrans.\nDRISCOLL: You’re really nothing to do with them, are you?\nDOCTOR: I’ve encountered them before, I admit. But I’ve no idea why they’ve come to Earth. [VOCAL SOUND OF EFFORT AS HE MOVES A LARGE GAS CYLINDER] Interesting. [HE TINKERS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE SCENE. ]\nDRISCOLL: What are you doing there?\nDOCTOR: Trying to find a way out. Do carry on... The ‘meds’?\nDRISCOLL: The meds they send... some kind of vaccine, I suppose. Reverses the effect of the madness.\nDOCTOR: The ‘madness’?\nDRISCOLL: You don’t know much at all, do you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That’s why I’m asking questions.\nDRISCOLL: [TO DEMONSTRATE] All right. Ellen, Ellen?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 63\nELLEN: [MAKES A FRIGHTENED WHIMPER]\nDRISCOLL: It’s all right, my love. Come here. You’1l be all right.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS SHE TENTATIVELY PADS OVER.\nDOCTOR: What’s the matter with her?\nDRISCOLL: I could see it beginning before... Ellen, tell the Doctor what you do here in the compound.\nELLEN: [VERY UNCERTAIN] Compound? That’s here... right?\nDRISCOLL: [KINDLY] That’s right. What do you and David McCallister’s lot work on here?\nELLEN: [TRYING TO REMEMBER] Mmm... mmmm... don’t... don’t remember. Ed? You gonna kill me? [ANGRY] You gonna kill me! No! Get away! Get away!\nDRISCOLL: [OVERLAPPING, CALMING HER] S’alright, Ellen. No need to be afraid. We’1ll look after you.\nDRISCOLL: ELLEN’S ANGER SUBSIDES INTO WHIMPERS. Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: She’s forgetting everything. She just seems to be afraid... and angry. You weren’t unlike this when we first met. So... this is the ‘madness’.\nDRISCOLL: It’s like a rage or a terrible fear. Like a fog in your mind. Confusion. You can’t think straight. You fight to remember the simplest thing. How to talk, how to light a fire.. how to think! And you saw it in Atherton too, the beginnings of it?\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 64\nDRISCOLL: Well, without the ‘meds’ from the Viyrans, that’s what happens to all human beings. That’s what everyone has been like for as long as anyone can remember.\nDOCTOR: But why?\nDRISCOLL: And the trouble is, there aren’t enough meds to go round... and... [SIGHS, ASHAMED ]\nDOCTOR: Ed? What is it?\nDRISCOLL: A couple of days ago... well... [HE STOPS]\nDOCTOR: You stole all the meds from this compound, didn’t you? That’s why there was that large stockpile of them sitting around uselessly outside your encampment. I see. But that still doesn’t tell me ‘why’ all this has happened... what this ‘madness’ is.\nDRISCOLL: Ooooh, that’s the big one, Doctor. The question no one can answer. Maybe not even the Viyrans. Why, one day, the whole human race... just forgot...\nDOCTOR: Forgot everything? [SUCCESSFULLY UNSCREWS CYLINDER HEAD] Ah Got <avte<\nDRISCOLL: Everything useful... like civilization.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, Mr Driscoll... what year is it?\nDRISCOLL: We don’t know.\nDOCTOR: You don’t— ?\nDRISCOLL: The vaccine gives us back our humanity, Doctor. But we can’t remember much about what happened before the madness came. All our knowledge has come from the\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: Viyrans and what they’ve told their little pet, David McCallister— Doctor, what the hell are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Give me a hand... Well, you want to get out of here, don’t you?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 66\nWALKING: THROUGH CORRIDOR. DOOR OPENS AS THEY PROCEED.\nDAVID: Where are we going?\nCHARLEY: The Viyrans are being typically secretive. I want to find out about Mila. What their scans reveal. And I think... yes, their laboratories are down here... as far as I remember. Unless they’ve moved them again.\nDAVID: So.. you work for them? The Viyrans.\nCHARLEY: Huh... that sounds like I’ve got a formal contract or something. I wouldn’t put it quite like that. Er... turning left here.\nDAVID: How did you get to be on this ship?\nCHARLEY: It’s a long story— Hold on, I think we need to go back the other way. Sorry. Follow me.\nDAVID: And how come there are... two of you? Is she a twin?\nCHARLEY: No, she certainly isn’t!\nDAVID: Then what?\nCHARLEY: STOPS. DAVID STOPS TOO.\nCHARLEY: Look... David... Let’s just take this one step at a time, all right?\nDAVID: [GETTING INCREASINGLY AGITATED] Wait a minute! I’ve trusted the Viyrans. They came here to help us. That’s what they said. And I believe them. Why shouldn’t I? They've helped, they’ve given us the vaccine. But you... You’re something different. So tell me, what exactly have you got to do with the Viyrans’ plan to save Earth?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 67\nCHARLEY: Their plan to save the Earth? Mm... well... David.. It’s not quite as simple as that.\nDAVID: What’s that supposed to mean?\nCHARLEY: Look, I don’t know why they brought you here! It was probably just a mistake, like everything else that’s been going on here recently—\nDAVID: Mistake? What’s going on here? I’ve a right to know!\nCHARLEY: I dare say you have, David. But I’1l1 tell you one thing, when it comes to people’s rights, the Viyrans usually have something else on their minds. Now, if you really want to be helpful, you can tell me something I need to know.\nDAVID: Why should I trust you?\nCHARLEY: Oh, I don’t know! Because we’re both human beings?!? Because there’s an almighty mess here and I can think of only one person who’1l be able to sort it all out.\nDAVID: Who?\nCHARLEY: The Doctor! Have you heard of him? Did you see him? Did Mila mention him?\nCHARLEY: PAUSE.\nCHARLEY: Well? Oh come on, David, please.\nDAVID: She mentioned him. Who is he?\nCHARLEY: He’s our only hope. And he’s down there, on Earth?\nDAVID: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 68\nCHARLEY: Right, change of plan. We’ve got to find one of the Viyrans’ shuttles and get down there... now.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 69\nDOCTOR: [FINAL PHYSICAL EFFORT]... good.\nCLANG: AS HE PUTS A LARGE CYLINDER ON THE GROUND. Stand back, please, Ellen. Right back.\nELLEN: You gonna kill us?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly, if you don’t stand right at the other end of the hut... Good girl.\nDRISCOLL: So what’s in this?\nDOCTOR: This tank by the door contains a few dregs of aviation fuel... not much, but enough.\nDRISCOLL: Enough for what?\nDOCTOR: For the impact of the valve from that tank over there to cause an explosion. Impressed?\nDRISCOLL: Er... well...\nDOCTOR: There must have been utter chaos when this ‘madness’ consumed the human race, am I right?\nDRISCOLL: Wars broke out, there was mass murder. And no one knew how to work the technology any more.\nDOCTOR: That crater I saw out there—?\nDRISCOLL: Used to be an oil refinery. No one knew how to run it safely. It just blew up, taking the city with it. No one knew how to cure diseases, build things, grow things... There were epidemics, catastrophes... The human population was cut by over two billion in a decade... they say.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 70\nDOCTOR: ‘They’ meaning the Viyrans, I take it?\nDRISCOLL: Yeah. They came and helped us. Their ships landed all\nDRISCOLL: over the world. Alien saviours. But it was too little\nDRISCOLL: too late. They just set up small survivor groups. Gave the temporary vaccine to a privileged few.\nDOCTOR: They didn’t have a plan to save the whole of Mankind?\nDRISCOLL: Oh, they had a plan all right, and they selected a puppet to implement it for them.\nDOCTOR: A puppet? Who?\nDRISCOLL: His name is David McCallister.\nDOCTOR: I see. Um... how do you know all this, Ed?\nDRISCOLL: Because I used to be part of his happy little team here... until I walked out in disgust.\nDOCTOR: Because of the plan? What was it?\nDRISCOLL: [DERISIVE] To make documentaries.\nDOCTOR: Documentaries?\nDRISCOLL: Charity appeals to the Viyrans.\nDOCTOR: Charity... ? I confess I know very little about them, but somehow that just doesn’t sound like their style.\nDRISCOLL: Now, are we going to get out of here or not?\nDOCTOR: Back here, with me... behind the second tank.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS DRISCOLL AND DOCTOR MOVE AWAY FROM DOOR.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 71\nDRISCOLL: And what’s in this one?\nDOCTOR: Compressed oxygen. I’ve loosened the valve all I dare. All we need to do now is give it a good whack with something, and the valve will shoot off, propelled by the escaping oxygen, into that fuel tank. ‘Ka-boom’ and we blow the door off.\nDRISCOLL: What do we hit it with?\nDOCTOR: Something big and heavy.. there’s a pile of old tools over there.\nDRISCOLL: Right... [WITH EFFORT, PICKS UP A BIG HAMMER] This do?\nDOCTOR: Splendidly, I’d say. Hopefully Sergeant Atherton and his people won’t be expecting the door to blow up.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 72\nSOLDIER: [RUNNING UP AT FULL PELT] Sergeant!

Page 74\nLARGE: DOOR OPENS.\nVOICES: ARE HUSHED.\nCHARLEY: Right, this is it.. shuttle bay.\nDAVID: Do you know how to fly these things?\nCHARLEY: Well, I’ve travelled in them quite a few times, so I’m pretty sure I’1ll be all right. I mean, how difficult can it be? Anyway, we don’t have a choice, we have to find the Doctor.\nCHARLEY: [BEAT] Right.. No Viyrans about. Good. Come on.\nDAVID: Just... hold on.\nCHARLEY: What?\nDAVID: I still don’t understand why we need your friend the Doctor.\nCHARLEY: Because—\nDAVID: Yes, I know you think he’1ll sort out the mess on Earth, but the Viyrans are already doing that. Why do we need the Doctor to—?\nCHARLEY: Look, David, you seem like a nice, trusting chap, and I don’t want to upset you, but... well...\nDAVID: Well what?\nCHARLEY: All that trouble on Earth? Everyone losing their memories and reverting to barbarism?\nDAVID: The ‘madness’, yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 75\nCHARLEY: You think the Viyrans came to save you from that, don’t you? Like medical missionaries or something?\nDAVID: They did... they are.\nCHARLEY: David... It was the Viyrans who caused the madness in the first place.\nDAVID: What? But—!\nDOOR: OPENS. VIYRANS APPROACH.\nVIYRAN: Charlotte Pollard, we do not wish you to leave this ship.\nVIYRAN: Why are you attempting to leave?\nCHARLEY: Because I want to find the Doctor.\nVIYRAN: We know of your desire to find the Doctor. We have promised to help you.\nCHARLEY: Then how come he’s down there on Earth and you haven’t told me? Just slipped your minds, did it?\nCHARLEY: PAUSE.\nCHARLEY: No answer for that, then?\nDAVID: This woman has told me that—\nVIYRAN: You will come to the central control area with us.\nCHARLEY: What if I’d rather take a shuttle down to Earth?\nVIYRAN: We will not permit that.\nVIYRANS: MOVING CLOSER.\nCHARLEY: [SOTTO, TO DAVID] Beginning to get the picture, David?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR, DRISCOLL AND ELLEN DASH THROUGH UNDERGROWTH.\nDRISCOLL: This is it.\nDRISCOLL: THEY COME TO A HALT, OUT OF BREATH.\nELLEN: Meds... You got meds.\nDISTANT: GUNFIRE. CONTINUES SPORADICALLY THROUGHOUT SCENE.\nDOCTOR: That’s coming from the wrong direction to be Atherton’s people at the compound.\nDRISCOLL: It’ll be one of his patrols, further to the west... which means the Foresters are on the move. Give me a hand with this injector, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That’s the one I used on you. This one’s full.\nDRISCOLL: Ellen, come here, my love.\nELLEN: You gonna hurt me?\nDRISCOLL: Only a bit.\nINJECTOR: INJECTS.\nELLEN: [GASPS IN PAIN, THEN SLUMPS]\nDRISCOLL: It’s all right... I’ve got you.\nELLEN: [GROANS IN PAIN]\nDOCTOR: I suggest we get as many of these cases of vaccine as we can and take them back to the compound.\nDRISCOLL: What about my people? The Foresters.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 77\nDOCTOR: Your people? They’re all your people, Ed, the Foresters and the ‘Compounders’. They’re all human beings. It\nDOCTOR: isn’t a question of taking sides.\nDRISCOLL: The Viyrans made us take sides, by helping some and leaving others to die.\nDOCTOR: All I know is that a lot more people will die if we leave the ones with guns in a state of primitive barbarism.\nELLEN: [RECOVERING] He’s right, Ed.\nDRISCOLL: Ellen, thank God you’ re—\nELLEN: Atherton’s got a pretty large arsenal of stuff at the compound, and he’s got the whole place wired up to explode if we’re infiltrated. I had to beg him not to hit the button last time you came to the compound.\nDOCTOR: Then that makes it even more imperative that we inject some sense into Atherton.\nDRISCOLL: [RELUCTANTLY] All right. Let’s grab the cases and go.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 78\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOOR: FOOTSTEPS OF CHARLEY AND DAVID. VIYRANS MOVING. SOUND OF SCANNER IMAGES CHANGING.\nDAVID: That’s the footage we sent you. What are you doing?\nVIYRAN: We are.. reviewing it. It is... great.\nCHARLEY: You were doing more than that. You were scanning it. I don’t understand your technology, but I’ve seen you scanning for viruses enough times to know—\nVIYRAN: You need not concern yourself with our work on Earth, Charlotte Pollard.\nCHARLEY: Why not? You woke me up because you wanted my help. So, come on, tell us... tell us both what you’re actually up to!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 79\nATHERTON: Don’t move!\nGUNS: COCK.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right. We’re not moving.\nDRISCOLL: Atherton, we’ve come to help y—\nATHERTON: Shut it!!! Shut it!!! Men, fire! Kill them!!!\nELLEN: No! Atherton! Can’t you see we’ve got the meds?\nATHERTON: Wha... ? Meds?\nDOCTOR: Yes, don’t you remember?\nATHERTON: Shut it!!!\nELLEN: Here.. look. Remember, I made you stand by and let Driscoll take them.\nATHERTON: Driscoll! He walked out on us!\nELLEN: Yes, but he’s back. We’re all back. And we’ve brought the meds with us.. so the Foresters can’t get them.\nATHERTON: [CONFUSED, UNCERTAIN GRUNTS]\nDRISCOLL: [SOTTO] He’s too far gone.\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] I don’t think so. I’m assuming everyone in the compound has been receiving the vaccine for some time?\nELLEN: [SOTTO] That’s true, Doctor, yes, years.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 80\nDOCTOR: [SOTTO] Then the vaccine may have built up a cumulative resistance against whatever chemical imbalance in the brain has caused this ‘madness’. And look... they still know how to hold and presumably use their guns. So, I think there’s just a chance that—\nATHERTON: Give me meds! Give it me!\nELLEN: Here.\nSHE: HANDS IT OVER.\nATHERTON: I will... inject!\nINJECTOR: INJECTS.\nINJECTOR: Aaargh!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 81\nVIYRAN: SCANNER IS BLEEPING.\nCHARLEY: [SOTTO] Notice how we’re not getting any answers?\nDAVID: [SOTTO] What’s that? I recognize that.\nCHARLEY: [SOTTO] What? David, no—!\nFOOTSTEPS: AS HE MOVES FORWARD.\nDAVID: [ALOUD] There’s a satellite view of my compound on this screen! Listen to me! Have you seen this?\nVIYRAN: Yes. It is a view from this ship’s orbital position.\nDAVID: But... what’s all this movement? Here.\nVIYRAN: APPROACHES.\nVIYRAN: The people you call ‘Foresters’. There are many thousands of them moving towards your compound with hostile intent.\nDAVID: But... why?\nVIYRAN: That does not concern us.\nDAVID: Does not concern... ? But why not? Can’t you intervene? You must have the power to intervene... even if the madness is all your fault! If the Foresters attack the compound, Atherton and his men will open fire. There’ll be a terrible loss of life. We can’t just sit here and allow that—\nVIYRAN: The information you have supplied to us makes intervention unnecessary.\nCHARLEY: The cameras they gave you have built-in bio-scanners.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 82\nDAVID: What? Built-in... ? What are you talking about?\nCHARLEY: The Blue Forgotten Planet project isn’t a charity appeal, David. They wanted shots of every human face to.. well... [SHE STOPS]\nVIYRAN: You may continue, Charlotte. The sample of scans David has given us is enough information to make a conclusion.\nCHARLEY: No! You can’t give up yet. What about me? And Mila? You haven’t explained that yet.\nVIYRAN: We will solve that problem in due course.\nCHARLEY: But the Doctor’s down there, you can’t—\nVIYRAN: The Doctor has chosen to involve himself. We cannot answer for him.\nDAVID: Look, I don’t understand what’s going on here. Charlotte, what are they saying? What are you talking about?\nVIYRAN: You may explain.\nCHARLEY: [ENRAGED] May I? Oh, thanks! I1/’11 make it short then, shall I?\nDAVID: Charlotte? What is it? Tell me.\nCHARLEY: I think... [SHE CAN BARELY BRING HERSELF TO SAY IT] I think the Viyrans are going to wipe out the human race.\nCHARLEY: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 83"

They’re human beings like you and me.\nATHERTON: Like you, maybe, Driscoll, but not like us. [ALOUD] Wait for the order to fire! Mark your targets and keep a grip of yourselves!\nDOCTOR: Atherton! Ellen is contacting the other survival bases, we have to wait until—\nATHERTON: They won’t help us! They won’t get here in time! Face it, Doctor! We’re on our own.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 85\nDAVID: But I don’t understand, you said you came to Earth to help us.\nVIYRAN: We have helped you. But now the help must stop.\nDAVID: But why?\nCHARLEY: Because of their mission, David. Their mission to wipe out all trace of the Amethyst viruses.\nDAVID: Amethyst... ? What are Amethyst viruses? You mean the madness is a virus?\nCHARLEY: No.. That was their attempt at a cure. And it went wrong.\nDAVID: What? How could the madness be a cure... a cure for what?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 86\nFOOTSTEPS: AS ELLEN RUSHES UP TO JOIN THEM.\nELLEN: [OUT OF BREATH] It’s no good... it’s no good. None of the bases can spare any help. They’re all running low on meds and—\nATHERTON: What did I tell you, Doctor?\nSOLDIER: Outer perimeter explosives now primed, Sarge!\nDOCTOR: We've got to contact the Viyrans.\nELLEN: The Viyrans? But how? And what will they do anyway?\nATHERTON: Give me the detonator.\nSOLDIER: Sarge.\nDRISCOLL: You can’t just blow them up!\nATHERTON: Just watch me. We detonate the outer perimeter charges. Cut their numbers down, maybe even scare them off.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me! The Viyrans came to Earth to help you. There’s no reason why they won’t help you now.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 87\nVIYRAN: We cannot help Mankind now. We detected one particle per human of the 001 Variant of Amethyst Icosahedral Plasmid Virus 9007/41.\nDAVID: What does that mean?\nVIYRAN: We launched a meson radiation disseminator to destroy that particle in every human being. We did not foresee the side effect.\nDAVID: Side effect?\nCHARLEY: The ‘madness’, David. The radiation caused some kind of massive chemical imbalance... somehow the result was that the human race had civilization wiped clean from its collective brains.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 88\nELLEN: Only David ever called them, I don’t know how—\nDOCTOR: Take me to the transmitter array.\nATHERTON: It’s too late for all that, Doctor. The only solution is to detonate the perimeter charges. If they get through that, we pick as many off as we can. If they’re still coming at us after that, we retreat to our dug-outs in the East and detonate the charges in the compound.\nDOCTOR: Sergeant Atherton, you must see that this is utterly barbaric.\nATHERTON: As barbaric as that lot ripping us to pieces? [ALOUD] Stand by, people! Stand by!\nDOCTOR: Ed, you’ve got to buy us some time.\nDRISCOLL: How?\nDOCTOR: You said they’re coming here because of you—\nDRISCOLL: They’re coming here because of the vaccine!\nATHERTON: There isn’t any left!\nDRISCOLL: But they’re not going to understand that!\nDOCTOR: Can’t you speak to them, Ed? Won’t they recognize you? It might at least slow them down.\nDRISCOLL: So that you have time to talk to the Viyrans? You really think they’1ll listen?\nELLEN: Isn’t it worth a try, Ed?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 89\nDRISCOLL: They only ever wanted to talk to their pet McCallister.\nDOCTOR: Well, they may talk to me. I’ve met them before. Come on, Ed, will you do it?\nDRISCOLL: I don’t know... Look at them out there. You don’t know what it’s like, Doctor. When you’ve got the madness... nothing makes much sense any more. You just feel angry... and afraid. And.. well, I made these people angry about the Compound, didn’t I? In away, this is my fault.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know exactly whose fault all this is, Ed, but it isn’t yours. This whole situation is a mess... and one\nDOCTOR: that I suspect should not be happening at all.\nATHERTON: What’s that supposed to mean?\nSOLDIER: They've reached the perimeter, Sarge!\nATHERTON: Right, that’s it!\nDRISCOLL: No! I’11 go.\nATHERTON: What?\nDRISCOLL: Let me try!\nDOCTOR: Good man.\nDRISCOLL: I’1ll give it my best shot. You’d better get to work on that transmitter, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don’t take any unnecessary risks, Mr Driscoll.\nELLEN: Good luck, Ed.\nELLEN: ED AND ELLEN KISS.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 90\nDRISCOLL: Go with the Doctor. If things go badly—\nELLEN: No—\nDRISCOLL: Don’t look back. Keep running. I love you.\nELLEN: I know. I love you too.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Ellen.\nDOCTOR: THEY DASH OFF.\nDRISCOLL: So.. Will you let me through, Atherton?\nATHERTON: Driscoll, they’1ll tear you to pieces—\nDRISCOLL: No, they’1l remember me. I’m sure they will. I hope they will. Give me a chance, Atherton. What do you say?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 91\nDAVID: All right, so it’s all your fault! And now you’re just going to eradicate us to cover up the mistake?\nVIYRAN: If the viruses cannot be eliminated, then the carriers themselves must be eliminated. It is a small price to pay for expunging all knowledge of the viruses.\nCHARLEY: A small price?!? You’re not the ones paying it.\nVIYRAN: We must follow our mission imperatives. That is why we were summoned.\nDAVID: But why did you bother to lie to us about the Blue Forgotten Planet project... filming every human face? Were you just mocking us? Is that part of your mission?\nVIYRAN: We needed to make a more detailed scan to assess the results of the meson radiation treatment.\nCHARLEY: But you haven’t scanned every human being on Earth yet.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 92\nSOLDIER: You think he’1ll stop them?\nATHERTON: Dunno... but he’s a braver man than me. Be ready to open fire if they rush him.\nDRISCOLL: [IN THE DISTANCE] Fellow Foresters! You know me! I am Driscoll! You know me and you trust me!\nATHERTON: My God... they’ve stopped.\nDRISCOLL: [IN THE DISTANCE] I am one of you! You can trust me!\nDRISCOLL: CROSS-FADE TO OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE, CLOSE TO DRISCOLL.\nDRISCOLL: I know you’re angry. I understand. I feel that anger too! You’ve seen how angry I’ve been before! But these people here.. they mean you no harm! It isn’t their fault!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 93\nVIYRAN: The sample is comprehensive enough. No further evidence is needed.\nCHARLEY: What?\nDAVID: What are they saying?\nVIYRAN: All the scans received so far show that the virus particle is still present in the human race. And now,\nVIYRAN: our schedule demands that we move on to the next stage of the mission.\nCHARLEY: What? So you’ve just run out of time! You can’t be bothered to try again?!?\nVIYRAN: There is no need.\nDAVID: No need? Not even to save—?\nTRANSMITTER: STATIC.\nDOCTOR: [HEAVILY DISTORTED] Hello! Hello! Come in, please!\nCHARLEY: Doctor? Doctor, is that you?\nDOCTOR: [HEAVILY DISTORTED] Do you hear me? This is the Doctor. Remember me? Hello!\nCHARLEY: Well, aren’t you going to answer him?\nVIYRAN: There is no need.\nCHARLEY: I have a need! Ido! And I’ve done a lot for you over the past few millennia. You know that! You couldn’t have completed your mission on some of the planets you’ve been to if it weren’t for me!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 94\nDAVID: What did you do for them?\nVIYRAN: That is not relevant at this time.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Hello! We are beaming our signal directly into orbit. Can you hear me? Please.. Come in. We are boosting the signal as much as we can. There is an emergency situation down here. We need your help.\nCHARLEY: [OVERLAP IN POST-PRODUCTION]\nCHARLEY: It’s relevant to me! You promised you’d let me know if you ever found him! Well, you’ve found him.. and I at least want to speak to him, before you do whatever you’re going to do.\nVIYRANS: MOVING AROUND. CONTROLS BEING OPERATED.\nDAVID: What are they doing?\nCHARLEY: Preparing to ‘expunge’ the human race, probably— Let me speak to the Doctor!\nVIYRAN: The disseminator is now being prepared.\nDAVID: What disseminator?\nVIYRAN: A disseminator that will impact on Earth and release radiation which will cleanse the planet of the human race.\nDAVID: ‘Cleanse’? This is a nightmare.\nVIYRAN: In the time remaining, you may speak to the Doctor.\nVIYRAN: BLEEP.\nCHARLEY: Doctor-Doctor-it’s-me!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 95\nDOCTOR: Charley? Charley, can you hear me?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Of course I can hear you, I’m on the Viyran ship. Just listen to me—\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute, Charley, I have to speak to the Viyrans. They have to help us. There are thousands of—\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Doctor, they know all that! We can see it from up here, but they’re not going to help you.\nDOCTOR: What?\nELLEN: Oh no. I knew it.\nDOCTOR: Sssh! Why not?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] It’s too complicated to explain now, but you’ve got to listen to me. Get to the TARDIS! Now! Get to it as fast as possible and leave Earth!\nDOCTOR: Charley, I can’t just—\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] They’re going to destroy the human race!\nDOCTOR: What? Why—?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Oh Doctor, does it matter why? They’re going to do it and they’re going to do it any minute now, so get out of there!\nDOCTOR: How? How are they going to destroy the human—?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] It’s too late for you to do anything about—\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 96\nDOCTOR: It’s never too late, Charley!\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] Oh Doctor, I’ve missed you. I’ve missed you so much. But you’ve got to trust me. I know the Viyrans.\nDOCTOR: [CONFUSED] You know—?\nCHARLEY: [DISTORT] I know what they’re capable of, and there’s nothing you can do to stop them. Please, you’ve got to save yourself and—\nCHARLEY: STATIC.\nDOCTOR: Charley? Charley!\nELLEN: There’s no signal. She’s been cut off.\nDOCTOR: What did she mean?\nELLEN: She meant we’re dead—\nDOCTOR: [PUZZLED] No... ‘I know the Viyrans... I know what they’re capable of’.\nELLEN: Does that matter? Looks like nothing matters—\nDOCTOR: Helicopter! Can you pilot it?\nDOCTOR: EXPLOSION IN THE DISTANCE.\nELLEN: Oh no. [RUNNING OUT] Ed! Ed!\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOOR: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 97\nANOTHER: EXPLOSION.

DRISCOLL’S FOOTSTEPS RUN UP TO US ON CONCRETE.\nDRISCOLL: [OUT OF BREATH] It was no good! No good! I thought\nDRISCOLL: they were gonna listen, and then—\nDOCTOR: You did your best, Ed—\nDRISCOLL: [SCORN] Yeah, and now Atherton’s doing his.\nELLEN: It doesn’t matter, Ed. Nothing matters now.\nDRISCOLL: What?

Ask yourself why not!\nVIYRAN: Your double is not infected either.\nCHARLEY: What?\nVIYRAN: And she is a completely perfect copy of you, down to the last cell. We will analyse this for future reference.\nDAVID: What about me?\nVIYRAN: What about you?\nDAVID: I’m human. Do I have this virus particle in me?\nVIYRAN: You do.\nDAVID: So... you’re going to ‘expunge’ me too?\nVIYRAN: You will be frozen for future reference. You may prove useful to us at a future stage of our mission. The cleansing disseminator is now prepared.\nCHARLEY: Please, you’ve got to reconsider. For my sake!

I hope.\nDRISCOLL: I’m guessing you mean something clever... judging by the technology you’ve got in this thing. Doctor, what exactly—?\nELLEN: You've stopped the Viyrans from killing everybody, you mean?\nDOCTOR: I think so... for now. And not only that... Let’s have a look at the scanner.\nSCANNER: OPERATES.\nELLEN: Viyrans!\nDRISCOLL: So that’s what they look like.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’ve managed to land us on their ship. Quite a tricky manoeuvre, actually. You two stay here. I’m going to have a word with them.\nELLEN: Is that a good idea?\nDRISCOLL: They did just try to wipe out the human race.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but I’m not human. Won’t be long... hopefully.\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 107\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS. DOCTOR EXITS TARDIS.\nVIYRAN: What have you done, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, and it’s nice to see you again too. I might ask the same of you.\nVIYRAN: Our mission is to remove all trace of the Amethyst viruses released in the explosion you failed to prevent—\nDOCTOR: I hope you’re not attempting to implicate me? It was the Daleks who—\nVIYRAN: All knowledge of the viruses must be expunged. It must be as if they had never existed.\nDOCTOR: I see... So you’re chasing around the universe, sniffing out every single virus that got scattered throughout time and space? That’s going to be more than several lifetimes’ work.\nVIYRAN: It is why we were summoned. What are you doing to our dissemination signal?\nDOCTOR: ‘Dissemination signal’? Oh, that’s the transmission you were sending to that projectile you rather rashly launched at Earth. What’s in the projectile, by the way?\nVIYRAN: Radiation designed to cleanse the Earth of the human race.\nDOCTOR: ‘Cleanse’? That’s a rather innocuous-sounding euphemism for genocide. So your deadly radiation can’t be released from the projectile without that transmission?\nVIYRAN: That is correct. How have you prevented that signal from reaching the disseminator?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 108\nDOCTOR: Ooh, trade secret, I’m afraid. Where’s Charley?\nVIYRAN: Both Charlotte Pollards have been frozen for future analysis—\nDOCTOR: ‘Both’?\nVIYRAN: . when our schedule allows.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, ‘both Charlotte Pollards’?\nVIYRAN: There are two Charlotte Pollards.\nDOCTOR: Two? No. I don’t understand.\nVIYRAN: There are two. Identical in every way.\nDOCTOR: Show them to me.\nVIYRAN: You must stop jamming our dissemination signal.\nDOCTOR: Show me Charlotte and I might just think about it. Might.\nVIYRAN: You must guarantee the release of the signal.\nDOCTOR: No guarantees. And you must show me why you consider it necessary to wipe out the human race.\nVIYRAN: It is part of our mission.\nDOCTOR: You said your mission is to remove all trace of the Amethyst viruses, does that often involve wiping out entire races?\nVIYRAN: Not often.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 109\nDOCTOR: Not... ? How often?\nVIYRAN: In our mission so far, we have located and expunged three million, four hundred and thirty-six thousand Amethyst viruses. In only five cases has it been necessary to wipe out an entire race.\nDOCTOR: [JAW DROPPING] Only five...\nVIYRAN: I will take you to see the Charlotte Pollards. Follow\nVIYRAN: me.\nVIYRAN: FOOTSTEPS. DOCTOR’S FOLLOW. DOOR OPENS.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 110\nVIYRAN: SHIP DOOR CLOSES ON SCANNER DISTORT.\nTIME: SPHERE EFFECT BURBLING AWAY TO ITSELF.\nDRISCOLL: I don’t get it. Two of them?\nELLEN: Neither do I, Ed. And you know what? I don’t care, as long as the Doctor doesn’t release their signal. As long as whatever clever thing this is here keeps going.\nDRISCOLL: It’s like we’re nothing to them, isn’t it? To the Viyrans. Like we’re just microbes in a lab.\nELLEN: I’ve never trusted them. Never.\nDRISCOLL: Even when your precious McCallister devoted his life to them?\nELLEN: David was just trying to do what he thought was best for all of us.\nDRISCOLL: Didn’t turn out that way, though, did it?\nTIME: SPHERE EFFECT FIZZES, THE PITCH WAVERING.\nELLEN: Hey, what’s it doing?\nDRISCOLL: I dunno, but that doesn’t sound right to me—\nANOTHER: FIZZ. SPARKS SHOWER.\nANOTHER: Woah— get back!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 111\nDOOR: OPENS. FOOTSTEPS OF THE DOCTOR AND THE VIYRAN.\nDOCTOR: Something’s changed, hasn’t it?\nVIYRAN: I do not understand you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You were helping the humans... They thought you were their saviours. Then suddenly, you decided to wipe them out. Why?\nVIYRAN: We have arrived.\nDOOR: OPENS. THEY WALK THROUGH INTO THE CRYO CHAMBER.\nLARGE: CHAMBER WITH RHYTHMIC HUMMING AND HISSING.\nLARGE: BLEEPS OF CONTROLS BEING OPERATED.\nVIYRAN: I am selecting the most recently frozen pods.\nVIYRAN: A POD UNLOCKS AND EMERGES.\nDOCTOR: How many people have you got frozen here?\nVIYRAN: There are beings from all over the universe frozen in this chamber.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nVIYRAN: They are of use to us in our mission.\nDOCTOR: You mean you use them as lab rats.\nPOD: LOCKS INTO PLACE. Who’s this?\nVIYRAN: This is David McCallister, an infected human.\nHISS: AS HE’S RESUSCITATED.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 112\nDAVID: [INSIDE POD] [GROANS, WAKING] What’s going on?\nVIYRAN: As we failed to cure this virus, we are keeping him as a specimen. Long term research may find a cure, which may prove useful if we discover a recurrence of this virus.\nDOCTOR: And what virus would that be?\nVIYRAN: The 001 Variant of Amethyst Icosahedral Plasmid Virus 9007/41.\nPOD: OPENS.\nDOCTOR: And that’s what the human race is infected with?\nDAVID: Yes. So they say. You must be the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. How did you know?\nDAVID: Charlotte mentioned you rather a lot.\nDOCTOR: [TO DAVID] What I don’t understand is, if the Viyrans had already developed a temporary vaccine, why did they give up?\nANOTHER: POD IS MAKING ITS WAY TO THEM.\nVIYRAN: The temporary vaccine had no effect on Virus 9007/41.\nDOCTOR: No effect? But it stopped what they called ‘the madness ’—\nDAVID: The ‘madness’ isn’t the virus, Doctor. It’s an accidental side effect of their attempted cure.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nPOD: CLUNKS INTO PLACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: Charley? Wake her up! Now! HISS OF RESUSCITATION.\nFROM: INSIDE THE GLASS POD WE HEAR...\nCHARLEY: [GASPS, WAKING]\nDOCTOR: Charley! Is that you?\nCHARLEY: [INSIDE POD] [OVERJOYED] Doctor! You made it!\nPOD: OPENS WITH A CLUNK AND A HISS. FOOTSTEPS OF CHARLEY. I’m so glad to see you.\nDOCTOR: You said there were two Charlotte Pollards.\nVIYRAN: Yes.\nANOTHER: POD IS HEADING THEIR WAY.\nCHARLEY: Oh... you know about that.\nDOCTOR: I see that you do too. Care to explain it to me?\nCHARLEY: Er.. yes, but—\nDOCTOR: [SNAPS] But what?\nCHARLEY: The human race. Have the Viyrans wiped out—?\nVIYRAN: Not yet.\nCHARLEY: Not yet? [LAUGHS, DELIGHTED]\nDAVID: That’s fantastic news!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 114\nCHARLEY: Oh Doctor, you’ve stopped them, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR: T—\nVIYRAN: The Doctor is preventing the disseminator signal from reaching the disseminator. He said he would release the Signal if we showed him the two Charlotte Pollards.\nDOCTOR: I said I might.\nCHARLEY: There’s only one Charlotte Pollard, and that’s me.\nCHARLEY: THE POD COMES TO REST.\nDOCTOR: Then who’s that?\nDOCTOR: HISS OF RESUSCITATION.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: [INSIDE POD] [GROANS, WAKING] Doctor? Doctor, is that really you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but is that really you?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 115\nTIME: SPHERE PITCH IS VARYING ALARMINGLY. ANOTHER BIG FIZZ AND EXPLOSION. SPARKS FLY.\nELLEN: I really think this thing... whatever the Doctor’s done... is going really, really wrong.\nDRISCOLL: Yeah...

FIZZING ARMS OF ELECTRICAL-SOUNDING\nENERGY: FIZZING ABOUT THE PLACE.\nBOTH: CRY OUT.\nELLEN: Well, I know one thing...\nDRISCOLL: What’s that?\nELLEN: I’m not going to stay here and get killed when it finally blows up.\nDRISCOLL: But he told us to stay in—\nELLEN: Ed, I never knew you do anything you were told to do! Come on! Er.. Did you see how he opened the door?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: IT SHOULD BE ALMOST COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL THE\nCHARLEYS: APART FROM NOW ON.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, you can’t seriously believe her—\nDOCTOR: Which of you arrived with me on Earth this morning?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: I did.\nDOCTOR: And you have no argument with that?\nCHARLEY: No, I told you. You found me in the future, on Earth, I was sending a signal—\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: No, that was me.\nCHARLEY: No! I was with the Doctor until I contracted some sort of virus. He took me to the Amethyst station to cure—\nALARM: SOUNDS.\nDOCTOR: What’s going on?\nVIYRAN: There are intruders. Humans have left your ship, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What? But I told them to stay—\nVIYRAN: They will be brought here.\nCHARLEY: Doctor, you can’t believe her. She’s a copy of me, a mutation of some kind of virus that—\nDOCTOR: Viyran, you must know. Which is the original?\nVIYRAN: It is impossible to tell. As I said, they are identical in every way.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY:\nDOCTOR WHO: That can’t be true! She can’t have the same memories as me.. about how I was a prisoner of the Daleks, how I escaped from them to find the Doctor—\nCHARLEY: Is that what she’s told you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you have another story?\nCHARLEY: Yes! And it’s not a ‘story’!\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Oh, this I’ve got to hear!\nCHARLEY: Doctor, I didn’t want to just blurt it out like this, birt.: bute.\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nCHARLEY: I’m from your future. I travelled... will travel with you...\nCHARLEY: in your future... when you're... different.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: That’s ridiculous!\nCHARLEY: I.. I loved you. And—\nDOOR: OPENS.\nVIYRANS: ENTER.\nELLEN: [RESTRAINED] Argh, get off me! Let me go!\nDRISCOLL: [RESTRAINED] Argh, Doctor, sorry, but—\nDOCTOR: Why did you leave the TARDIS? What’s the matter—?\nELLEN: [PULLING FREE] That thing you set up, whatever it was... it’s gonna blow!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nDOCTOR: Blow? Oh no...\nDOCTOR: BURBLE OF VIYRAN TECHNOLOGY.\nVIYRAN: The jamming of our dissemination signal is weakening.\nDOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, you don’t understand!\nVIYRAN: You have failed, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: [DASHING OFF] I have to get back to the TARDIS!\nCHARLEY: [DASHING] Doctor, wait for me!\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: [FOLLOWING] No, me!\nELLEN: Come on, Ed!\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THEY ALL RUN.\nVIYRAN: Restrain them!\nCHASE: MUSIC CRESCENDOS.

We’re trapped in here with it.\nDRISCOLL: [OUT OF BREATH] The others didn’t make it. David, the other Charley and the Doctor—\nCHARLEY: She isn’t another Charley! She’s called Mila and she’s just pretending to be me!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 121\nDOCTOR: Charley, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Aaargh... yes. Got a nasty grip, these Viyrans, haven’t they?\nDAVID: I’m all right too, in case anyone’s interested.\nVIYRAN: Jamming is now almost completely clear. Dissemination Signal is breaking through.\nDAVID: No! Can’t you stop them, Doctor? Charley said you were the only one who could sort this out. What’s going wrong?\nDOCTOR: I projected a time sphere from the TARDIS to stop their dissemination signal, trapping the signal in a time loop, but it was a lash-up. I’d hoped it would hold long enough—\nDAVID: Long enough for what?\nDOCTOR: For me to find another solution! Maybe persuade the Viyrans to shut the transmission off!\nDAVID: You were optimistic!\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: He always is.\nDOCTOR: Not any more.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The time sphere is imploding.\nSUDDEN: WRENCH OF TARDIS ENGINES.\nSUDDEN: Wait a minute, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.

THE TIME SPHERE FIZZES DRAMATICALLY.\nALL: CRY OUT.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.

I’d never do that!\nDOCTOR: She’s engaging the engines!\nDAVID: Is that good or bad?\nVIYRAN: Dissemination signal—\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t matter about any of that now. If the engines are engaged, the whole planet Earth could be sucked into a deflating time sphere, destroying the TARDIS. And if the temporal jolt is bad enough, Earth could be regressed back to prehistory or even before...\nDAVID: What? What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: Mankind could be ‘un-evolved’. Does that solve your problem, Viyrans? It will be as though the human race had never existed!\nDOCTOR: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 124"

It’s the rising power of the TARDIS that’s enlarging and distorting the collapsing time sphere, pushing the temporal curve of it further and further into the past.\nDAVID: So that’s it?

[CONTINUED IN NEXT SCENE]\nVIYRAN: CUT TO...\nVIYRAN: [SCANNER DISTORT] We only wish to destroy the disease—\nDOCTOR: [SCANNER DISTORT] I understand that, so why—?\nVIYRAN: [SCANNER DISTORT]\nVIYRAN: But we have calculated that there is no probable likelihood of expunging the virus without eradicating Mankind. And our mission must continue. We have detected\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 131 the location of several million more viruses and must\nDOCTOR WHO: move on as a matter of urgency.\nELLEN: [OVER THE ABOVE LINES] I’ve never believed that. I’ve never trusted them.\nCHARLEY: Strange as it may seem, it’s true. The Viyrans never—\nELLEN: [SNAPS, UPSET] Why should I trust you?\nCHARLEY: I’m sorry. Were you and... that man... close?\nELLEN: That man? That man! I don’t even know who the hell you really are, so just... just keep away from me!\nTIME: SPHERE POWER PITCH WOBBLES. A FZ2ZZZZT!\nCHARLEY: Oh no... oh no. Not again.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 132\nDOCTOR: Tell me about this virus! How did you cause the ‘madness’ on Earth trying to cure it?\nVIYRAN: It was an error that the meson radiation we disseminated had that unfortunate side effect.\nDOCTOR: You have a gift for understatement. Show me the virus. I’m assuming you have medical scans of it.\nSCREEN: ACTIVATES.\nVIYRAN: Observe the screen.\nVIYRAN: MILA/CHARLEY: That’s me.\nDAVID: And me.\nSCREEN: ADJUSTING VIEW FX.\nVIYRAN: We are scanning the humans present in this chamber. And the cellular analysis of David McCallister shows...\nVIYRAN: A BLEEP OF A FLASHING INDICATOR.\nDOCTOR: That’s the virus?\nVIYRAN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: But... but that’s just one particle.\nVIYRAN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Has David undergone treatment to reduce the growth of the infection?\nVIYRAN: There is no successful treatment. The virus is present as one dormant particle in every human being.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 133\nDOCTOR: Dormant?\nVIYRAN: But there is a one in five point four billion chance that at some time in the next seven thousand millennia, a human being may contract the virus.\nDOCTOR: Er.. I beg your pardon?\nTIME: SPHERE WAVERING AND FIZZING A LITTLE MORE.\nDOCTOR: [SCANNER DISTORT] Are you being serious?\nCHARLEY: [REALIZATION] Oh my God... they are.\nELLEN: You mean... this virus... it isn’t even really dangerous at all?\nCHARLEY: Apparently not. Depends how you define dangerous, I suppose.\nCHARLEY: FZZZZZZZ FROM TIME SPHERE.\nCHARLEY: And talking of dangerous.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 134\nDOCTOR: You really are serious, aren’t you?\nVIYRAN: I do not understand.\nDOCTOR: You would give an entire race almost fatally damaging treatment—\nVIYRAN: That was an unforeseen side-effect.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, well that makes all the difference! But you’d do that, then contemplate wiping them out, just because there’s a one in five billion chance of... of someone catching a cold or something in the next few million years?!?\nVIYRAN: The risk is within the parameters laid down for our mission.\nDOCTOR: Who exactly laid down these parameters?\nVIYRAN: I will not tell you.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes... forbidden knowledge and all that. Well whoever it was is an idiot! This beggars belief, it really does— [SUDDENLY NOTICING] Wait a minute! Your scan is including Charley as well. I don’t see a virus particle showing up in her! I thought you said all human beings—\nVIYRAN: Neither of the Charlotte Pollards contains the virus particle.\nDOCTOR: And you didn’t think that might have been significant?\nVIYRAN: We did think it was significant. And we will continue to analyse the significance as our mission continues.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 135\nDOCTOR: How nice for you! Slaughter a whole species, then just move on to the next. Life’s so uncomplicated for you, isn’t 1?\nVIYRAN: We must ask that the other two humans leave your ship.\nDOCTOR: What, so you can ‘expunge’ them?\nVIYRAN: We will freeze them as virus carriers.\nSCREEN: SCANNING NOISE.\nDOCTOR: You’re scanning inside my ship! Don’t you believe in privacy?\nVIYRAN: There is some kind of dimensional interface, but we are still able to detect lifeforms.\nSCREEN: ADJUSTS.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, I see. That must be the other Charlotte.. no sign of the virus there, and...\nDAVID: There’s only one other person. But Ellen and Driscoll both went in there with Charley.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: I’m Charley!\nDAVID: Not according to her, you’re not.\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Well she would say that—\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute! Look. Whoever that other\nDOCTOR: human being is in the TARDIS.. No virus.\nVIYRAN: Adjust scan. There is an error.\nVIYRAN: BURBLE OF VIYRAN CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 136\nDOCTOR: Definitely no virus.\nTARDIS: SUDDENLY WRENCHES AGAIN. F2ZZ2Z2ZZ.\nTARDIS: MILA/CHARLEY : Doctor, it’s happening again!\nTIME: SPHERE IS GOING CRAZY. SIZZLING BLASTS OF ENERGY.\nCHARLEY: Oh no! The time sphere—\nELLEN: It’s going to kill us, isn’t it? Like it killed Ed! We’ve got to get out of here!\nCHARLEY: No, we can’t! [GRABS HER]\nELLEN: Argh! Get off me!\nCHARLEY: If we go out there, the Viyrans will just freeze us!\nELLEN: And if we stay in here, we’ll die!\nELLEN: FZZ2ZZ2ZZ22Z2ZZZ OF TIME SPHERE.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 137\nDOCTOR: It’s the time sphere— [A THOUGHT, TO HIMSELF] Wait a minute...\nDAVID: What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Time, time, time... That’s it!\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: What’s ‘it’?\nDOCTOR: Viyrans, you’ve got to let me in there. I’m the only one who can stabilize the time sphere safely.\nVIYRAN: But if your time sphere destabilizes, then our dissemination signal will be able to release the cleansing radiation on Earth.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t need to release the radiation. Not any\nDOCTOR: more.\nVIYRAN: Why not?\nDOCTOR: Because I’ve found the cure!\nDOCTOR: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TIME SPHERE IS GOING BERSERK, FIZZING ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS.\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You were expecting someone else?\nCHARLEY: How did you get away from the Viyrans—?\nCHARLEY: FZZZ FROM TIME SPHERE. Doctor, look out!\nDOCTOR: Keep back, both of you!\nTARDIS: CONTROLS BEING OPERATED.\nELLEN: Can you put it right? Can you stop this sphere thing killing us?\nTARDIS: CONTROLS BURBLE AWAY. THERE’S A HUGE ENGINE GROAN FROM THE TARDIS, THEN SILENCE. NOT EVEN A BACKGROUND NOISE.\nDOCTOR: [PHEW] Temporarily.\nCHARLEY: What’ve you done?\nDOCTOR: Shut everything down.\nCHARLEY: But... will that work?\nDOCTOR: Not for long. Ellen, where’s Ed?\nELLEN: He... that thing... he was— It killed him.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 139\nDOCTOR: I see. I’m so very sorry, Ellen. He was a good man.\nELLEN: Yeah. Yeah, he was.\nDOCTOR: And I intend to see to it that there are no more senseless deaths.\nCHARLEY: What happens now, then?\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS AGAIN.\nFOOTSTEPS: ENTER.\nELLEN: David, what—?\nCHARLEY: What’s she doing here? What have you got there?\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: [CARRYING DISSEMINATOR] They said you’d know what to do with this disseminator thing, Doctor.\nDAVID: [CARRYING] Where do we put it down?\nDOCTOR: Next to the console, just there, please.\nDOCTOR: WITH VOCAL EFFORT, A METAL DISSEMINATOR PLACED ON FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: Good, thank you. Now then...\nSTARTS: OPERATING TARDIS CONTROLS, CONTINUES UNDER...\nSTARTS: MILA/CHARLEY: Doctor, what are you going to do? What did you and the Viyrans decide on?\nELLEN: He’s working for the Viyrans?!?\nDOCTOR: Only in as much as I’m working towards the same end. It’s just the means that have changed.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 140\nDAVID: Ellen, they never meant us any harm. They were just... well, just trying to save the universe.\nELLEN: Oh, very grand, but we’re expendible, the entire human race can just die out as far as they’re concerned!\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. They have their minds on ‘higher’ things. But they’re not wilfully antagonistic, and besides I gave them a practical alternative to wiping out Mankind.\nELLEN: Like what?\nDOCTOR: Like you, Ellen. [CONCENTRATING ON CONTROLS] Aha, I’ve located the power matrix signature.\nDOCTOR: A LOW LEVEL HUM STARTS UP.\nELLEN: Me? You’re handing me over to the Viyrans? No way!\nCHARLEY: Doctor? You’re not seriously going to—\nDOCTOR: Don’t get excited. Ellen, you were the proof.\nDAVID: Of course! You showed up on their scans as not having the virus.\nDOCTOR: Just like Charley...\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : You mean me?\nCHARLEY: Me!\nDOCTOR: Both of you are not infected with the virus the Viyrans came here to expunge. [BACK TO CONTROLS] Now, time to...\nDOCTOR: A FEW CONTROLS OPERATED. THE HUM OF THE TARDIS WINDS UP\nFROM: NOTHING.\nFROM: There we are. Power reactivated.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 141\nDAVID: What about your time sphere thing?\nDAVID: MILA/CHARLEY: Yes, won’t it destabilize again and destroy the Earth?\nDOCTOR: Not with that energy disseminator the Viyrans gave you.\nCHARLEY: The Viyrans have given you the power to shore up your time sphere?\nDOCTOR: Not only shore it up, but extend it.\nCHARLEY: Why?\nELLEN: I’m not getting any of this. What have I got to do with—?\nDOCTOR: Ellen, what have you got in common with Charley?\nELLEN: Well... I don’t know... Both of us are women?\nDOCTOR: You’re both human, yes?\nELLEN: Well, obviously.\nDOCTOR: You’re both human and you don’t have the virus. Every other human does. Every other human has a dormant particle that’s been passed down the generations, probably since the earliest evolution of Mankind.\nELLEN: So?\nDOCTOR: You’ve both travelled in the TARDIS. You’ve both travelled in time. Once the Viyrans realized that, they ran a check on the TARDIS. They may not understand temporal physics, but they soon identified the Chronon particles that get released during time travel.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 142\nDAVID: And they’re the cure for the virus?\nDOCTOR: Inexplicably, yes! Chronon particles utterly obliterate the 001 Variant of Amethyst Icosahedral Plasmid Virus 9007/41.\nCHARLEY: So.. what are you going to do with your time sphere?\nELLEN: Er... look at the screen.. The Viyrans look like they want to talk to you, Doctor.\nCONTROL: BLEEP.\nDOCTOR: Yes, hello, won’t be long.\nVIYRAN: [SCANNER DISTORT] Doctor, our readings show that your machine is now accessing the power matrix of the disseminator.\nDOCTOR: Care to wish me luck?\nVIYRAN: We hope that you are successful.\nDOCTOR: And if I’m not?\nVIYRAN: We will revert to our first plan.\nELLEN: What, and wipe everyone out?\nVIYRAN: It is the only alternative.\nDAVID: To what?\nCHARLEY: Doctor, you can’t let the Viyrans—\nDOCTOR: I can only do my best, Charlotte. That’s all anyone can ever do. But luckily, my best is...\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 143\nCONTROLS: OPERATE. TARDIS ENGINES ENGAGE WITH A BUMP.

Page 144\nDOCTOR: David, Ellen... we’re back on Earth. You can everything to me now.\nDAVID: And that’s it? But.. why? What are you going to do?\nELLEN: What’s going to happen?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s best if you don’t know.\nDAVID: Oh... We’re just supposed to accept that, are we? After all the years of struggling and—\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nELLEN: You’re no better than the Viyrans, playing god with the future of the human race.\nELLEN: MILA/CHARLEY : You can’t say that, that’s not true, the Doctor—\nCHARLEY: [COMPLETE OVERLAP] The Doctor would never... do that.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: That’s what I was going to say!\nDOCTOR: David. Ellen. Please. All I can do is ask that you to trust me. Will you do that? Please?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nDAVID: Seems like we don’t have much of a choice.\nDOCTOR: Not if you want the human race to carry on as it was meant to carry on.\nDAVID: You reckon you can achieve that?\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 145\nDOCTOR: I believe so.\nDAVID: Well... it’s all I’ve ever worked for... for as long as I can remember.\nELLEN: Doctor... just don’t let us down. Gonna open that door?\nTARDIS: DOOR OPENS. THE BREEZE FROM OUTSIDE WAFTS IN.\nDAVID: Good luck, Doctor.\nELLEN: And... thanks.\nDOCTOR: That is, perhaps, a little premature. But thank you.\nFOOTSTEPS: AS THEY LEAVE.\nCHARLEY: What about us?\nTARDIS: DOOR CLOSES.\nDOCTOR: I’m about to attempt to extend the time sphere around the entire planet Earth.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Is that possible?\nDOCTOR: I’m about to find out. Then, within the sphere, I’m going to reverse the Earth’s timeline to a point before the Viyrans fired their first disseminator. To be precise, just before they detected the virus present in the human race. The Viyrans have given me the exact time.\nCHARLEY: So you’re going to shift the entire human race back in time—\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : And cure them of the virus!\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 146\nDOCTOR: Or.. in short, break every rule in the book. And do you know why I’m going to risk doing that?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. Because of you two.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY: Because of—?\nDOCTOR: Because the TARDIS defences didn’t protect you from that Amethyst virus. Because you wanted to use Carmen’s time machine... because there are two of you! But mostly because none of this feels... right to me.. The human race driven mad by alien radiation, civilization destroyed... And I think it’s all because of you two. Something you’ve done. An action that didn’t fit into the established timeline. I don’t know exactly what it was — perhaps it was the release of the Amethyst viruses in the first place, I’m not sure — but I think you’re some kind of intrusion in time, causing a fundamental corruption of\nDOCTOR: Bi oe\nCHARLEY: The Web of Time. That’s what you’re talking about, isn’t it? You always used to talk about it.. I mean, you will, in the future, when I will travel with you.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : Oh, Doctor, this is all ridiculous! You can’t seriously believe that she—\nDOCTOR: [FIRMLY] Go on.\nCHARLEY: I told you... My past is your future. I know it’s difficult for you to believe—\nDOCTOR: No more difficult than believing that you were the prisoner of the Daleks, and you hid in a Dalek time ship, finding out all about me, then finally managed to escape and send out a signal that I just happened to pick up.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Doctor, you know me. We’ve travelled together for such a long time now—\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 147\nCHARLEY: I’m sure you have, but when we were on Amethyst you took my place! I saw you change into me before my eyes, and then the Viyrans took me and cured me of the virus you gave—\nSUDDEN: SURGE OF DANGEROUS-SOUNDING ENERGY FROM THE TARDIS. ALARMS START BLEEPING.\nSUDDEN: MILA/CHARLEY: What’s going on?\nCHARLEY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Viyran energy disseminator has reached maximum output potential. It seems to have a mind of its own. I have to activate the time sphere now.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY : I can help you, Doctor. Just tell me what to—\nDOCTOR: No! I want you both to leave. I don’t know which of you is telling the truth. Maybe you both are. Maybe neither of you are. But I don’t have time to work it out, and I can’t trust you any more. So leave. Now!\nDOOR: OPENS.\nDOOR: MILA/CHARLEY : Doctor, no! Please!\nDOCTOR: What I’m about to do could destroy the TARDIS. You’ll be safer on Earth. Go! Now!\nDOCTOR: CUT TO...\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 148\nFOOTSTEPS: WALK OUT OF TARDIS. DOOR CLOSES.\nFOOTSTEPS: MILA/CHARLEY: See what you’ve done!\nCHARLEY: You really think this is my fault? He doesn’t believe either of us.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : Is it true, what you said.. about being with the Doctor in the future? About... loving him?\nCHARLEY: Yes.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : That’s why you didn’t ‘belong’ in the TARDIS, isn’t it? Why you weren’t protected by her defences.\nCHARLEY: You said ‘her’...\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Yes, I suppose I picked that up from the Doctor.\nCHARLEY: You’ve travelled with him a long time, haven’t you? Since you’ve been... me, I mean.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Yes.\nCHARLEY: Longer than I did, I suppose.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Yes.. it’s been... amazing. Like a dream. An incredible life.\nCHARLEY: Yes. I know that feeling.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Perhaps it was more than I deserve.\nDEEP: THUD OF THE TARDIS.

I mean, you’re living proof of that, aren’t you? You’re from the Doctor’s future. You know that he lives on and changes—\nCHARLEY: No, I don’t know. My coming back in time may have changed everything, Mila—\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: [SUDDEN RAGE] Don’t call me that! I’m not Mila anymore!\nCHARLEY: Well, you’re not me! You can’t be me! Just because you mutated—\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : I’m Charlotte Pollard... and you’re supposed to be dead!\nCHARLEY: Oh, if the Doctor could only hear you now. You may have been his perfect little companion for goodness knows how long, but if he knew that underneath you were just some kind of maladjusted, psychopathic—\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY :\nCHARLEY: Well perhaps you’d like to spend a lifetime being tortured by the Daleks and see how ‘maladjusted’ you turned out to be.\nCHARLEY: Oh this is pointless! It’s pointless arguing... It’s all over. We’ve both lost him. I’ve lost him again.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY : What do you mean?\nCHARLEY: Oh, it’s a long story.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: Tell me.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs.\nALL: HELL BREAKING LOSE.\nDOCTOR: Argh, no! Too much temporal distortion! Come on, girl! Come on!\nDOCTOR: A CIRCUIT BLOWS.\nDOCTOR: Argh! This is ridiculous! The power level is...\nDOCTOR: A HUGE FZ2ZZZ.\nDOCTOR: Aaaaargh! This isn’t going to work!\nDOCTOR: old\nDOCTOR: Page 150\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 151\nCHARLEY: In the future... I saw him die. And he didn’t regenerate.\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY:\nCHARLEY: So.. your future Doctor... died. I’m so sorry, Charley. I really am. I shouldn’t have done what I did. I admit that. But I’ve become a different person now. I’ve become you, or something very like you, and the Doctor and I... well, we’ve bonded.\nCHARLEY: Not any more. Not now I’m here. Now he doesn’t trust either of us. [SIGHS] Seems like I mess everything up, don’t I?\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY :\nCHARLEY: Maybe... but I’m... I’m glad you’re not dead. I’m glad those Viyrans cured you and... and that it’s turned out that I didn’t get the life I stole from you by killing you.\nCHARLEY: THE TARDIS ENGINE SUDDENLY KICKS IN WITH AN HORRIFIC, LONG, DEEP SCRAPING.\nCHARLEY: Now that can’t be right!\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY :\nCHARLEY: We can’t leave him in there, on his own. And if you’re right that your coming back in time may have upset history, he might die in there! We’ve got to help him!\nCHARLEY: Yes... but how? He’s locked the door!\nCHARLEY: MILA/CHARLEY: [REMEMBERING] He gave me a key, on one of our adventures, long ago! He gave me.. [FINDING IT] this key!\nCHARLEY: He really did trust you, didn’t he..

It’s been such a great life, travelling with you, but I’ve started to feel like.. like I’m always running away.\nDOCTOR: There are some things out there in the universe that it’s very advisable to run away from.\nMILA: Oooh, I know that.\nMILA: THEY BOTH CHUCKLE.\nMILA: But... I’ve come to rely on you and the TARDIS too much. Every time there’s something scary, there’s always you... and the TARDIS. Always somewhere safe. And I feel like I’m starting to cling to that... a bit too much.\nDOCTOR: [ALREADY WITHDRAWING] Well... I’11 look in on you from time to time.\nMILA: I don’t think you will.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense, of course I—\nMILA: I think you’ll mean to. But once you’re in that thing... you just get lost in other worlds. Other lives. You’1ll soon meet someone else, and you’1ll want to show them the universe too. It’s what you do. It’s what you love.

You’re walking around free and I’m clamped to this chair? Call it intuition. So, which one are you?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: Does it matter?\nDOCTOR: Have you been crying?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: [TAKES A DEEP BREATH] You know, the Viyrans are very secretive about their work. It’s part of their mission to make sure no one knows about the viruses. So... if anyone does get to know anything.\nDOCTOR: They kill them? You’re here to kill me?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: No. Oh Doctor, no! They have ways of altering people’s memories.\nDOCTOR: I think you’1ll find that my memory is rather more robust than most—\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: They’ve already changed it at least once.\nDOCTOR: What? When?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: No... You see, you don’t remember. But the alteration wasn’t as... Significant as this. So you never know your luck, this alteration might fail. The memories might come flooding back. But then they’1ll try again and again\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: and again... and you’ll keep resisting them. And eventually...\nDOCTOR WHO: I’m afraid... I’m afraid you might die... or they’1ll decide they have to kill you anyway.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I could fool them.\nDOCTOR: PAUSE. You think they’re too clever for that, don’t you?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: They are. Believe me.\nDOCTOR: For some reason, I do. So, what do you propose, Charlotte? Have you come to unlock the clamps on this chair? Have you planned an escape route?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: Let me tell you a story. You meet a girl on the R101 airship. She’s meant to die in the crash.\nDOCTOR: If this is something from my future, I don’t—\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: [PRESSING ON] But you save her. And that tears at the fabric of time itself... the web of time... But in a way, you don’t care. Because you’re in love with her.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like I became reckless in my old age.\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: Isn’t that what old age is for?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps...\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: Then, one day, you and this girl.. this woman, decide to go your separate ways. But before this happens, she sees you die.\nDOCTOR: Charlotte, I don’t—\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: And you don’t regenerate.\nDOCTOR WHO: Blue Forgotten Planet — by Nicholas Briggs. Page 158\nDOCTOR: Why are—?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: You die.\nDOCTOR: Why are you telling me this?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: Because I think the only way the Viyrans can erase your memory without killing you, is if you really want to forget. And now you know that when you meet Charlotte Pollard, your life will nearly be over—\nDOCTOR: Everyone dies, Charley. Even me. I’m... prepared for that.\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: But you didn’t know... you won’t know.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I do know, when I ‘meet’ Charlotte Pollard way off in the future, perhaps I will know that it’s the beginning of my last, greatest adventure. Perhaps I’11l decide that for the sake of the web of time, it’s best to keep that knowledge to myself.\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: No, you didn’t know. And what if all this knowledge you now have of what’s to come were to have some terrible effect, not just on you, but on the future of the universe?\nDOCTOR: How can I possibly know the answer to that?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: What would you do if it wasn’t you? What would you do if it was someone else in this position, and there was a way to adjust their memory, so that the future was safe?\nA CHARLOTTE POLLARD: What would you think was the wisest thing to do then?\nLONG: PAUSE.
