INT. CATACOMBS. 21*°* CENTURY.\nLEANNE: (TOUR MODE) Hold onto the handrail, that’s right. Now has anyone heard the story of how these catacombs were discovered?\nLEANNE: No? No-one. Well, the chamber we’ve passed through used to be the living room of a student house. And one night, students being students, they decided to play with a Ouija board. I’1l tell you the full, baffling events of that night later, but for the moment, let’s just say that they discovered that their house had a basement. And what a basement! A series of blocked up passages, running under the entire street.\nLEANNE: Spooky, yes? Look to your left. See these vaults? They were originally store rooms for the merchants who lived above but... (TO THE VOICE) No, they really were, shut up.\nLEANNE: But at some point, they were abandoned, as the shops became houses. But not abandoned entirely. Some of the vaults have been bricked up, but others were pressed into sinister use. You see this one here on the left? Look, but, I beg you, don’t go inside.\nLEANNE: When the catacombs were uncovered this chamber was found. It\nLEANNE: had been put to (DRAMATIC FLOURISH) Sinister Purpose. We call it “The Temple”. See the carvings on the wall? What can they mean? Madam, do you know?\nAUDIENCE: (“Well no I don’t,” “Satanism?” “I hope she’s not picking on me, I’m shy” MUTTERING)\nAUDIENCE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 5\nLEANNE: No-one knows. Professors have been around and no-one, no-one can read them. (SIGHS, SOFT, TO THE VOICE ONLY SHE CAN HEAR) No, don’t tell me what they say. (BRIGHT) And then, of course, there are these little stones, all in a circle. Now, what do you think they are, eh?\nTOURIST: 1:\nTOURIST: Stools?\nLEANNE: Very good, sir. No. And please, don’t go near them. They are... a little like Stonehenge, aren’t they? And it is said\nLEANNE: that terrible things happen if you venture inside the circle. Terrible. (THEATRE) But don’t take my word for it. Be my guest.\nLEANNE: We can only guess that something was worshipped down here. Something evil. And that is why the Catacombs were sealed. But that is not the only unusual thing down here. You asked for a ghost tour. I’ll give you one. (PAUSE) Look at the end of the corridor. Those three steps. Yes?\nLEANNE: Stay looking at those steps. I’m going to ask you to be brave. I’m going to turn off the electric lights. And I’m going to take this candle — an ordinary candle, (SHOWING IT TO ONE OF\nHER: GROUP) would you agree sir?\nTOURIST: 2: Yes.\nLEANNE: Very good. You’re an expert on candles.\nLEANNE: Now, stay standing terribly still. And watch the wall as I walk towards it. The shadows. Watch the shadows\nAUDIENCE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nTOURIST: 1: That figure!\nTOURIST: 2: How did you do that?\nTOURIST: CAMERAS.\nLEANNE: (STERN) No pictures. No. But you all see it, yes? A shadow of a man, standing at the top of the steps. And yet, look around. Is there anyone here casting the shadow? No. We call him The Patient Man. (DRAMATIC PAUSE) It's an optical illusion. Clearly. (SMILES) Because, after all, there is no such thing as ghosts.\nAUDIENCE: FX. A BOOMING SOUND ECHOES THROUGH THE CATACOMBS.\nTOURIST: 1: What was that?\nTOURIST: 2: Just traffic. That’s all.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORTED, UNRECOGNISABLE, HOWLING NOISE.

(TO GROUP) The exit is this way. No, sir, no — don’t go into that chamber. Someone — please, stop him. Keep him back from the altar.\nTOURIST: 2: This whole place is falling apart.\nTOURIST: 1: (FROM INSIDE THE TEMPLE) It’s fine in here.\nTOURIST: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nLEANNE: Get out of the temple. Please. Let’s get to the steps. Follow me. Ladies and gentlemen — and come away from the altar.\nTOURIST: 1: (DREAMY, NOT THEMSELVES) But, I have to. It’s calling to me.\nLEANNE: Everyone else, get out — all right? I’1l get him. Sir, do not step inside that circle.\nTOURIST: 1: He’s coming! He’s reaching out to you!\nLEANNE: (GRAPPLING) Sir! Come on, out you come, and — no!\nTOURIST: 1: Sabbayoth is hungry.\nLEANNE: What?\nTOURIST: 1: Sabbayoth is coming and he needs you.\nLEANNE: No. Please. Stay out of my head. Please! Shut up!\nLEANNE: (FX NOTE: DURING ALL SCENES WITH LEANNE, THE DOCTOR HAS A\nSLIGHT: FILTER ON HIM. HE'S NOT PHYSICALLY THERE, IS, IN EFFECT, A GHOST. )\nDOCTOR: (F.) And there we are! I should be in focus now. Hello! Sorry about the theatrics. Bit confusing, but can I ask you not to panic?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nLEANNE: What! Did you cause all this?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Um. Yes.\nLEANNE: To get my attention? What are you?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Look, this is all rather awkward. Anyway, I’m the Doctor and, look, do you by any chance believe in ghosts?\nLEANNE: You’re kidding.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nLEANNE: SCENE 3. INT. CATACOMBS. 17th CENTURY.\nADRIC: (SIGHS) Looks like we’re stuck down here.\nTEGAN: Catacombs, underground passageways, cellars — they'll feature heavily in my autobiography.\nNYSSA: (LOOKING AROUND) But where are we?\nADRIC: Does it matter? It’s just a cave of some sort.\nDOCTOR: (FIRM) We’re on Earth.\nADRIC: Again? Let me guess — is this Heathrow?\nTEGAN: Most amusing.\nADRIC: (GOADING) Or, perhaps, many centuries from now this will be Heathrow? Funny how we keep missing.\nNYSSA: Adric.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS is, well, many wonderful things. Problems only occur when you aim for a specific spot. Would be much easier if we didn’t. You know - a watched pot never boils.\nNYSSA: But that’s silly.\nADRIC: Not at a quantum level.\nTEGAN: I don’t care. Where are we? Why are we here?\nTEGAN: Is that the TARDIS? Why's it making that terrible noise?\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 10\nDOCTOR: (HURT) I’ve always considered the TARDIS a she, not an it.\nTEGAN: Fine. Why is your little pony making that racket?\nDOCTOR: Something in our surroundings is upsetting her. We didn’t come here by accident. We answered a distress call.\nNYSSA: Did we?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS is very fond of them. In theory, somewhere in these, um, caverns, should be a spaceship and a friendly alien in need of help.\nADRIC: I get it. “Officers And Cars Respond To Urgent Calls”\nDOCTOR: Very good.\nTEGAN: What are you talking about?\nADRIC: I read it on the TARDIS door.\nNYSSA: But there isn’t a spaceship here.\nDOCTOR: Well, we haven’t found one yet. We’ll just have to explore a bit more, won’t we?\nTEGAN: Great.\nDOCTOR: Of course, whoever sent the distress call may not actually need one.\nNYSSA: Not all races require a spacecraft.\nDOCTOR: (GRATEFUL) Exactly! There are gateways, muon pathways, and, erm.. all sorts of things.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 11\nADRIC: But what’s an alien doing in these caverns?\nTEGAN: Looking to get out?\nDOCTOR: Asking for help. We may not have found it — but I think the\nTARDIS: has interfaced with it.\nDOCTOR: See? Now, Adric, Nyssa, why don’t you go over there? Tegan and I will go this way.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 12\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4. INT. CATACOMB STEPS. 17th CENTURY.\nNYSSA: Careful.\nADRIC: I am being careful.\nNYSSA: It’s just these steps — well, they’re not very...\nADRIC: Regular?\nADRIC: FX. NYSSA STOPS.\nNYSSA: (SIGHS) I miss Traken. (SAD PRIDE) Our staircases were very regular. I’m going back down.\nADRIC: I can’t see how high they go. This torch isn’t very powerful.\nNYSSA: Let’s go back.\nADRIC: Not coming up with me? If I go on, I'll leave you in the dark.\nNYSSA: (SHIVERING, NOW SLIGHTLY OFF) It’s so cold down here.\nADRIC: Only to be expected if we are underground. Also if there are buildings on top of this, then the amount of heat permeating downwards would be minimal. Unless of course, we were a long way underground, sufficiently so as to be able to induct heat from the Earth’s core-\nNYSSA: (OFF) Stop talking!\nADRIC: Charming! Sorry if I was boring [you] —\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 13\nNYSSA: (OFF) Can’t you feel it? The cold. There’s something in the cold.\nADRIC: I can’t feel anything.\nADRIC: You’re being hysterical. Come up the stairs. The Doctor told us to explore. I’m exploring. If there’s a way out, I’m going to find: 2h.\nNYSSA: (OFF) Please. Don’t leave me in the dark.\nADRIC: Come up the stairs, then. (GOES UP MORE STEPS) Not much further. I can see the ceiling. And, if I’m right, there should be a hatch or...\nADRIC: Oh.\nADRIC: What now?\nNYSSA: (OFF, SOFT) The Doctor was right.\nADRIC: What about?\nADRIC: Well, I’ve bad news. There’s no way out. We’re sealed in. The entrance has been blocked. Anyway, what were you saying? What’s the Doctor right about?\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nNYSSA: (OFF) We’re trapped. And there is something in here with us. can feel it in my mind. And Adric? (LOUD, PANICKED) It’s coming for you.\nSABBAYOTH: (DISTORTED) Sabbayoth!\nADRIC: What? (FALLS) Arg!\nADRIC: 14\nADRIC: I\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 15\nADRIC: SCENE 5. INT. TEMPLE CHAMBER. 17th CENTURY.\nTEGAN: You could have brought another torch.\nDOCTOR: There are plenty more in the TARDIS... somewhere. (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) I wonder if this place is some kind of temple. See — there’s even a stone circle.\nTEGAN: The mini Stonehenge?\nDOCTOR: Crudely, yes. And the markings on this wall are fascinating.\nTEGAN: Uh-huh. That’s one word for them. Seriously, have you never seen a Peter Cushing film?\nDOCTOR: (HE HAS) Well...\nTEGAN: Someone has drawn with blood all over the walls. It is blood isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Appears to be, yes. (CONSIDERING) Whatever these markings are... I can’t decipher them. They’re ancient. Which is odd as...\nDOCTOR: (SMACKS LIPS) The blood is relatively new. And tastes of chicken. Not human. So there’s something.\nTEGAN: But look at this place — it’s a temple isn’t it? A temple with blood on the walls. It’s not going to be good, is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, not necessarily. The thing is, trapped aliens are apt to be — ah — misconstrued by the local, more primitive populations. Killed out of fear. It’s even trickier if they use mental projection and arrive without a body. They end up being worshipped. Which doesn’t help anyone in the end.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 16\nTEGAN: So there's something down here. An alien. It doesn’t have a body. People kill things for it and write sinister squiggly things on the walls and you’re suggesting we offer it a lift?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Tegan, there’s so much life in the universe — some of it so strange, so wonderful that it translates badly into our own experience.\nTEGAN: The dead chickens are a translation error?\nDOCTOR: Probably. “Hello” can be a surprisingly tough concept to crack.\nDOCTOR: CRUNCH.\nTEGAN: Doctor. Could you shine your torch over here?\nDOCTOR: In a moment, I’m just trying to get my head round [this symbol. It may be an E.]\nTEGAN: (OVER THE END OF HIS LINE) Now.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Oh.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, step back.\nTEGAN: What. Am. I. Standing. In?\nDOCTOR: Step back. That’s all. Yes. That’s right. You can look now. If you really want to.\nTEGAN: (LONG INTAKE OF BREATH) It’s a pile of bones. Eurgh. But they're... mushy.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 17\nDOCTOR: (PEERING) Hmmmn. The bones are breaking down. Something’s attacking the valency of the bonds in the molecules — sucking the energy out of them like, well, marrow from a bone.\nTEGAN: Right. So they don’t just sacrifice chickens to it. It eats them?\nDOCTOR: Chickens? Yes.\nTEGAN: What? I mean, those are just chicken bones aren’t they?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (PAUSE) No.\nTEGAN: Oh god.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nTEGAN: SCENE 6. INT. CATACOMB STEPS. 17th CENTURY.\nADRIC: (GROANING) Nyssa? Where are you?(EDGE OF PANIC) Nyssa?\nADRIC: FX. NYSSA'S VOICE COMES FROM A WAY OFF.\nNYSSA: (OFF) I’m here.\nADRIC: Something attacked me. I lost my footing, fell down the steps.\nNYSSA: (OFF) Are you all right?\nADRIC: My leg... oh, it’ll heal. How about you?\nNYSSA: (OFF) I’m fine. Well, I assume I am. You’ve been quiet for so\nNYSSA: long.\nADRIC: (EMBARRASSED) I dropped the torch.\nNYSSA: (OFF) I heard it fall. It's probably broken.\nADRIC: I can’t find it. If only I knew where I’d fallen in relationship to the stairs then I could calculate its whereabouts.\nNYSSA: (OFF) Really?\nADRIC: (CAUGHT) No. (PAUSE) Something attacked us. But it wasn’t physically there. All I felt was - cold.\nNYSSA: (OFF) Adric...?\nADRIC: Just that single moment. It felt horrible.\nNYSSA: (OFF) Adric! It’s still holding on to me. It won’t let go. can’t move.\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 19\nADRIC: What? Nyssa. I’m coming towards you.\nNYSSA: (OFF) It’s pushing into my head. Peculiar. On Traken, we’re aware of fear, but we try not to feel it. But this... thing. It wants me to be afraid. It’s like a hand, stroking my spine.\nADRIC: Is it talking to you?\nNYSSA: (OFF) Not in a direct sense. Well, I think the Doctor’s alien has found us.\nADRIC: I do too.\nNYSSA: We should find a way of communicating with it.\nADRIC: Do you think that’s wise? It’s attacked us.\nNYSSA: It’s so alien. Perhaps it’s making me feel afraid... to tell me that it feels afraid. (SMILES BRAVELY) Yes. Maybe that’s it.\nADRIC: I think I’m standing next to you. Nyssa? Are you there?\nADRIC: Oh, come on Nyssa. Answer me.\nNYSSA: (SHIVERING) Sorry. I was too.. frightened to speak.\nADRIC: I’ve got you! There! I’ve got your hand. It’s so cold. (PAUSE) You can feel me holding your hand, can’t you?\nNYSSA: No. But then (SADLY) I don’t think you’re holding my hand.\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nADRIC: But --- (PANIC) I can’t let go! Nyssa,\nNYSSA: I can’t let go.\nNYSSA: Adric, it’s making me feel something else. (WORRIED,\nNYSSA: THOUGHTFUL) Hungry.\nNYSSA: 20\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 21\nNYSSA: SCENE 7. INT. CATACOMB CORRIDOR. 17th CENTURY.\nDOCTOR: (RAPID) .. An interface between mental and atomic energy. I mean, it’s not so bizarre. You boil a kettle and that energy translates into a nice cup of tea and that makes you feel all’s right with the world and yes, that’s one way, but what we’re seeing here-\nTEGAN: Slow down, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I gabble when I’m nervous. Tegan, we have to find Adric and Nyssa and get them back to the TARDIS. What drew us here...\nTEGAN: Bad news?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The force that’s become trapped down here. It’s not necessarily evil. It’s just that it is so very unlike us, and, I hate to say this, but I don’t think we’re going to get along. (SHOUTS) Nyssa! Adric! (PAUSE) Oh, where are they?\nTEGAN: These caverns are huge. Let’s try down here.\nDOCTOR: I told them to go right.\nTEGAN: Which is why we’re trying left.\nDOCTOR: Aren’t you going to ask me what the creature is?\nTEGAN: No. I’m not going to like the answer.\nDOCTOR: Very sensible. You see, what it is —\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 22.\nDOCTOR: - is an ancient force. I think, right now, it’s very weak. But it feeds off energy. Life energy. Such as chickens.\nTEGAN: And us?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Any form of life is energy to it. Which is why we’re getting out of here. It’s so starved that we can’t reason with it. It’1ll just devour us.\nTEGAN: (SOFT) Doctor, I’ve found them.\nTEGAN: YANKING AT ADRIC AND NYSSA.\nTEGAN: They’re just lying there.\nTEGAN: DOCTOR/TEGAN: Adric! Nyssa! Come on! Snap out of it!\nNYSSA: . So cold.\nADRIC: (MUTTERING) No, please, stay back, no more!\nDOCTOR: Come on, you two, let’s sit you up. Tegan, help me move them over to the wall.\nDOCTOR: & TEGAN:\nDOCTOR: That's it, there we go.\nTEGAN: They’re freezing.\nDOCTOR: Both of you. Open your eyes. That’s right. Look at me. Can you remember your names. Yes?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 23\nADRIC: Adric.\nNYSSA: Nyssa.\nDOCTOR: Very good. Excellent.\nADRIC: (WEAK) Not really. Name recognition requires a really low intellectual response. Tegan?\nTEGAN: Yes?\nADRIC: See?\nTEGAN: Hey!\nNYSSA: Doctor, can you feel the cold?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Don’t worry. We’re going to get you back to the TARDIS and you’re going to be fine.\nTEGAN: It’s freezing here. Much colder than everywhere else. Why is that?\nNYSSA: Because the alien’s here. All around us.\nDOCTOR: Draining the energy out of the air, of course!\nNYSSA: It’s fed on us already. But it left us alive. Because it knew that you would come looking for us.\nDOCTOR: Not good. Can you walk?\nADRIC: (GRUNTS) No. I can’t move my legs.\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 24\nNYSSA: It's clever — cunning. Leaving us unable to walk to detain you here. Doctor, Tegan — leave us.\nADRIC: (FEAR) No! Please — take me with you — take us. I can’t stand ats\nTEGAN: Come on — let’s (EFFORT, HEAVE) get you up — drunk passenger training. Come on, you brave soldier. Doctor, get Nyssa.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT, LIFTING NYSSA) When it comes for us, I’1l try and communicate.\nTEGAN: I thought you said we couldn’t talk to it.\nDOCTOR: I’d like to try.\nDOCTOR: FX. THEY START DRAGGING NYSSA AND ADRIC ALONG THE CORRIDOR.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Can you hear me?\nNYSSA: What’s happening?\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) I’m reaching out to it. Thinking calm thoughts along the Vantalla scale.\nTEGAN: (EFFORT) You seem to have confused it.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) That’s the intention.\nNYSSA: You can let go now, I can manage on my own.\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 25\nADRIC: Me too.\nNYSSA: It projects emotions. I think that's how it communicates.\nDOCTOR: Which is why I'm projecting to it how calm I feel. (SMILES) It’s really quite nippy, isn’t it?\nADRIC: Doctor, you don't seem calm.\nDOCTOR: Not now, Adric.\nADRIC: It’s just, if you’re trying to tell it that you’re feeling calm and you’re actually not feeling cam, isn’t it going to get [confused? ]\nDOCTOR: (TERSELY, INTERRUPTING) Not now! I said, not now!\nADRIC: I don't think anger will help.\nSABBAYOTH: DOCTOR, TEGAN, NYSSA, ADRIC: (FEAR) Aaaaargh!\nDOCTOR: Run!\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8. INT. TARDIS. 17‘\" CENTURY\nDOCTOR: 26\nHEAR: FOOTSTEPS COME RUNNING.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) Come on everyone — into the TARDIS. We’1ll be safe there.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) It’s stuck! The key's stuck!\nTEGAN: (MUFFLED) Now? It picks this moment to get stuck!\nADRIC: (MUFFLED) Nyssa! Hurry up!\nNYSSA: (MUFFLED) It’s so hungry.\nDOCTOR: (MUFFLED) And — finally!\nDOCTOR: BUT THE DOCTOR IS HAVING TO PUSH THEM.\nDOCTOR: There's something wrong with the doors. Push! Come on,\nDOCTOR: everyone, push!\nTRAVELLERS: STEP INTO THE ECHOING DEAD, TARDIS.\nTEGAN: What’s going on? It’s so dark in here.\nDOCTOR: OPEN,\nDOCTOR: I was afraid this might happen. Close the doors — come on.\nDOCTOR: Quickly — put your backs into it. Got to keep it out.\nDOCTOR: THE DOORS ARE SHUT.\nNYSSA: (QUIETLY) Doctor, the TARDIS is dead isn’t it?\nADRIC: But it can’t be!\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 27\nTEGAN: Well, she is.\nDOCTOR: The alien feeds on life. And the TARDIS is a living entity. Well, she was.\nTEGAN: (SOFT) Are you okay?\nDOCTOR: (SOFT) Not really. No.\nTEGAN: So those cries the TARDIS was making — a distress call?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (THINKS) Well, no.\nADRIC: So we’re trapped here?\nNYSSA: Not now, Adric.\nDOCTOR: (RALLYING) They weren’t distress calls. She was trying to escape. The TARDIS has a defence mechanism — The Hostile Action Displacement System. HADS for short.\nNYSSA: So, when it finds itself in danger it goes elsewhere?\nTEGAN: It scarpers from trouble?\nADRIC: It’s never worked before.\nDOCTOR: (BUSY) Like memory it’s selective. Now — before the alien force burrowed into her, the TARDIS was trying to relocate. So there could — should — be some latent energy. I can tap into the system and effect an, um, emergency temporal shift. Nyssa, open that roundel and get me some more copper cable.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nTEGAN: Can we help?\nDOCTOR: In a moment. Now — we’ll have to go outside.\nTEGAN: What?\nADRIC: (POINT SCORING) It’s inadvisable to set up a temporal field inside a time machine.\nTEGAN: You want us to go outside?! But that thing’s out there!\nDOCTOR: Then we’ll be have to be quick!\nDOCTOR: 28\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 29\nDOCTOR: SCENE 9. INT. CATACOMB TEMPLE. 17*‘\" CENTURY.\nDOCTOR: DRUM OF COPPER CABLE (ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HOSEPIPE REEL. )\nDOCTOR: This way, come on, feed the cable this way. That’s right?\nNYSSA: The centre of the temple?\nDOCTOR: Why not? It’s a nice open spot. Now, yes, that’s right, lay it out in a loop inside the stone circle —\nDOCTOR: Also, the area will have picked up a fair amount of residual psychospoor which will help to anchor the temporal field.\nTEGAN: (CONFUSED) I'm confused.\nNYSSA: (PATIENT) If you meditate on a point, it acquires mental energy. If you do it enough.\nADRIC: That’s ridiculous.\nNYSSA: Not on Traken.\nDOCTOR: Or in an English country church. Same principle applies. Especially if the vicar’s boring. Now then —\nADRIC: (INTERRUPTING) But how does that even work?\nDOCTOR: Stop quibbling! Please. You need to get inside the loop. I’1l activate the temporal field, and it’1l relocate you.\nDOCTOR: POWER.\nDOCTOR: There we go, I’ve activated the Displacement Generator. And there’s some power! Yes, this is going to work. Now, step inside the loop, please.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nNYSSA: It’s coming back.\nDOCTOR: Of course it is. It’s sensed the energy. It’s hungry.\nNYSSA: What’s to stop us rematerializing inside a wall?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, cross your fingers.\nADRIC: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Look, there’s a reason I travel around inside a box. Other than style. But this is your best shot.\nNYSSA: Our best shot?\nTEGAN: Aren’t you coming with us?\nDOCTOR: Not... immediately. I’m staying behind to make sure this works. Then I need to deal with the alien. Don’t worry, once I’ve done that I’1l come and find you.\nNYSSA: That’s quite a list!\nTEGAN: Why not pick up a pint of milk while you're at it?\nDOCTOR: Now, close your eyes, deep breath, and hold on tight.\nADRIC: To what?\nNYSSA: How are you going to defeat the creature?\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 31\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry — I know exactly how to deal with it — no, stay in the circle.\nADRIC: But don’t you want us to help you?\nDOCTOR: I want you safe. Because you’re children.\nDOCTOR: ADRIC, NYSSA, TEGAN: Doctor! Come on! No. Etc.\nDOCTOR: No, no protests. Just stay where you are. You’1ll be fine. Here we go. I'll find you.\nSABBAYOTH: ACTIVATES. THE DOCTOR IS THROWN BACK.\nDOCTOR: Argh!\nNYSSA: & ADRIC: Aieee!\nDOCTOR: (GROANS) It worked. It actually worked.\nDOCTOR: Thought that’d shut you up — all the energy’s spent. The only thing left to feed off here is me. (STANDS UP, DUSTS HIMSELF\nDOCTOR: OFF) Now all I have to do is work out a way to deal with you. Because right now, I have no idea.\nTEGAN: (CLEARS THROAT) Children?\nDOCTOR: Tegan? What?\nTEGAN: You really think we’re just children?\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 32.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing here?\nTEGAN: I figured you needed some help dealing with this thing. Turns out you do.\nDOCTOR: I told you! I told you! “Stay in the circle.” Why couldn’t you — just once — listen to me?\nTEGAN: You didn't have a plan, did you? You were just flinging us off through time and then what?\nDOCTOR: I’d have temporised. Anyway, you’d have been safe. That’s the most important thing.\nTEGAN: And you'd have just left us there to fend for ourselves?\nDOCTOR: That was the very worst case. If I can’t find a solution — which I will — before that thing devours me. Well... I'm sure\nDOCTOR: I’ll find a way out of here before that happens. Hopefully.\nTEGAN: Thought so. We’1ll work out something together, Doc. We will. And then we’ll go get the others.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 33\nTEGAN: SCENE 10. INT. CATACOMB CORRIDOR. 17*\" CENTURY.\nTEGAN: There’s got to be a way out of here hasn’t there? We just need to think practically.\nDOCTOR: We’re a long way underground. The only way out is blocked up.\nTEGAN: So — right — the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nTEGAN: You say it’s been drained. But it’ll recharge, won’t it?\nDOCTOR: I hope so.\nTEGAN: There you are then. We’1ll just hang around, dodge that thing, and wait until the TARDIS’s batteries are full.\nDOCTOR: That could take centuries.\nTEGAN: You’re kidding.\nDOCTOR: No.\nTEGAN: (SIGHS) Rabbits.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 34\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11.

We’re going to burn her.\nMATTHEW: You most certainly are not.\nGILES: But vicar — she flew into my field!\nNYSSA: (WEAK) I didn’t fly. I can’t fly. I fell.\nMATTHEW: Did you see her flying?\nGILES: Well, er.. it’s more that...\nGILES: She sort of was just there. Like. (DOUBTFUL) Don’ witches just pop up from the ground, like, reverend?\nGILES: Or from beneath the ground. That's it!

Perhaps you’ve sold some cows there?\nGILES: (MUMBLING) Not sure I’ve had the pleasure of an invite, Reverend.\nMATTHEW: Well, their cattle market is very choosy, I hear.

(PAUSE) Where’s the alien gone?\nDOCTOR: It’s eaten an entire TARDIS. Probably has indigestion.\nTEGAN: So it’1ll leave us alone?\nDOCTOR: No, no. I don’t think it needs to manifest. It can probably just.. induct the energy from us.\nTEGAN: Induct?\nDOCTOR: Giant squids aren’t always swimming around eating, um-\nTEGAN: Sharks? Whales? Captain Nemo's Nautilus?\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 41\nDOCTOR: Quite. When they’re at rest on the ocean’s floor, they’re digesting, bloated from their recent meal. All big predators do the same. I think the alien works like that too. It’s basically dormant, gathering together enough energy to manifest in a new physical form.\nTEGAN: Wait. So when it came here...\nDOCTOR: It left its body behind and simply projected its “soul”.\nTEGAN: But why would you..[do that]?\nDOCTOR: If you’re travelling an unimaginably long way. You just project yourself as far as you want. And then, when you arrive, you induct energy from your surroundings, until you have enough to make a new body.\nTEGAN: But surely that’s going to take a while?\nDOCTOR: If you’re capable of beaming yourself all the way across the universe, you’re not the kind of lifeform to care about a few centuries.\nTEGAN: Bizarre. How did it get people to — you know — bring it chickens?\nDOCTOR: The induction field — it operates at the, ah, persuasive end of the Vantalla spectrum. If you were a cat, you’d be leaving presents on the doorstep. If you’re a human being, well...\nTEGAN: It’s on with the cloaks and “All Hail Space Blob”?\nDOCTOR: (SMILES) It’s like you’ve met him. As a method it’s clever, subtle — doesn’t draw too much attention to itself while it gets on with knitting itself a new body. Mind you, there’s a problem — it’s eaten its way through the TARDIS’s telepathic circuits. That might exacerbate things.\nTEGAN: (WEARY) Right.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 42\nDOCTOR: At the very least the surrounding biosphere will experience psychic overflow... wait. Tegan, are you all right? You didn’t ask for an explanation.\nTEGAN: I’m feeling a bit tired, actually. May just lie down for a bit...\nDOCTOR: No! Snap out of it! It’s feeding on you. Come on — get up, get up. That’s right, lean on me.\nDOCTOR: TO WALK UP AND DOWN.\nTEGAN: Let go of me!\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) No. Got to keep you walking.\nTEGAN: I don’t want to keep walking.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) For once in your life you’re not going to get your way. Stay with me.\nTEGAN: But I’m so tired.\nDOCTOR: Why didn’t you tell me earlier?\nTEGAN: I didn’t want to make a fuss.\nDOCTOR: You must be ill.\nTEGAN: Hey!\nDOCTOR: Good!

A bit of scandal’s salt for the stew.\nNYSSA: I assure you, nothing’s further from the truth.\nMATTHEW: Ha! Am I that unappealing?\nNYSSA: No, no. Not at all.

Current owners of what?\nNYSSA: The vault I said I was in.\nMATTHEW: The one you escaped from on your broomstick.\nNYSSA: You’re still having trouble with time travel, aren’t you?\nMATTHEW: Absolutely.\nNYSSA: (PORING OVER BOOKS) Well, if we assume that the Doctor was right I’ve moved a little bit forward in time but not in space, so the vault would theoretically be nearby.\nMATTHEW: I see.\nNYSSA: And these maps of the city\nMATTHEW: Cartographical studies by my predecessor, the Reverend Elias Peascold.\nNYSSA: These maps, combined with this geological survey... (BREAKS OFF TO ADMIRE IT) It’s really not a bad piece of work considering this is...\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 51\nMATTHEW: This is 1738!\nNYSSA: Exactly. (BACK ON TRACK) Well, it allows me to narrow down soil composition. Now, much of the ground — from here to here, (SHE INDICATES ON THE MAP) is far too boggy for there to be cellars.\nMATTHEW: Your reasoning is sound.\nNYSSA: And this, to the North, is too hard. Which leaves this area here where the ground is relatively soft and also at an incline, which would allow for the building of cellars as part of levelling up. Unless, that is, you build your houses at a slope-\nMATTHEW: No gentleman would contemplate such a crime.\nNYSSA: Well, there we are then. This street here has a lot of houses belonging to merchants, which would make the need for cellars understandable. Most of them are, apparently, still in use, which rules them out.\nMATTHEW: Why?\nNYSSA: Oh, you’d know. Your history books would be overflowing with accounts of an angry young woman discovered in one of the cellars, demanding to be shown to the nearest airport.\nMATTHEW: What’s an airport?\nNYSSA: Don't interrupt my flow.\nMATTHEW: I’m terribly sorry.\nNYSSA: That’s quite all right.

Because of the chickens.\nDOCTOR: Oh — the ones sacrificed in the temple.\nTEGAN: Yes.\nDOCTOR: The temple’s been sealed up.\nTEGAN: But what if the alien feels like chicken tonight? Surely whoever worships it will find a way to come down and feed it?\nDOCTOR: Not so simple. The 1600s are a time of pretty strict religious persecution. An alien induction loop is one thing, but self- preservation is another. It’s a stronger impulse — the people who worshipped this thing.. they sealed these catacombs up ina hurry — that chicken blood was fresh. So either they suddenly decided to worship from a distance or more likely they got caught in the act and had to flee, walling this place up to conceal the evidence. Whatever their reasons, I don't think they're coming back. At least, not in time to save us.\nTEGAN: Can’t you say something reassuring?\nDOCTOR: Well, I think we’re better off without them.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 57\nTEGAN: Better off, why?\nDOCTOR: Because people who sacrifice chickens to disembodied demons don't usually stop at poultry.\nTEGAN: You mean... human sacrifices?\nDOCTOR: It's been known.\nTEGAN: Well, maybe someone else will find us.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I imagine the alien's retained some worshippers to guard the place and ensure it's not disturbed as it begins to grow itself a corporeal shell. These caretakers will protect the Site for as long as the entity wishes them too — months, years, centuries.\nTEGAN: And if someone were to try and bypass these caretakers and get in here?\nDOCTOR: They'd be stopped.

I’ve never worn anything like it before.\nMATTHEW: Just keep up the pace. It doesn’t do for a vicar to be late for his own service.\nNYSSA: Sorry, again.\nMATTHEW: What’s up with them all — waiting for me outside the church?\nNYSSA: Perhaps it’s locked.\nMATTHEW: No. (TO FARMER GILES) Giles! What’s the meaning of this?\nGILES: It’s the woman, Reverend.\nGILES: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 71\nMRS STUBBS: Woman? Ha! She knows what she is.\nNYSSA: Mrs Stubbs! I have no idea what you're talking about.\nMATTHEW: (HISSING) Nyssa, quiet.\nNYSSA: No. I won’t be quiet. What is going on here?\nGILES: We’re barring the Reverend from his church. Until he recants.\nMATTHEW: I beg your pardon?\nGILES: Reverend, sir, you’ve come under the influence of this — woman.\nMRS STUBBS: Say it man! She's a witch!\nGILES: And sir, unless you release yourself from this... creature, we'll have none of you in our church.\nMATTHEW: This is preposterous. All of you — this is monstrous. This is no creature, no witch — this is a girl. I took her in, as our Saviour would, because she was friendless and in need of charity. That is all-\nMRS STUBBS: (OVER) I’ve had enough of this. (SHOUTING) She’s a witch! A witch!\nCROWD: Witch! Witch! Witch!\nCROWD: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 72\nNYSSA: I’m not! I’m not!\nGILES: Denounce the witch! We beseech you! We’re praying for you, Reverend.\nMATTHEW: How can you be so simple-minded, so narrow, so cruel.\nCROWD: Witch... witch... witch... witch!\nNYSSA: Stop this!\nMRS STUBBS: Vile creature — release the reverend from your talons. If there’s any human decency left in you, release this man. He is a good man.\nCROWD: Aye, aye, aye!\nNYSSA: Matthew, let's go! They’re hysterical.\nMATTHEW: (GIVES A LONG ANGUISHED CRY, THEN) No. No. Get thee behind me, Satan.\nMATTHEW: (WHEELS AROUND, FURY) You — girl. You’re what they all said you are. I see that now. Winding yourself into my mind, Sinking your claws into my soul. Well, you shan’t have it. You shan’t. (TO CROWD) All of you — I am thrown before you humbled. I am ashamed, and you have brought me to the light. The flock have led the shepherd out of the woods.\nCROWD: (MURMURING, SCATTERED APPLAUSE).\nMATTHEW: This creature is what you say she is — do with her what you will.\nMATTHEW: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nNYSSA: (UP CLOSE, SOFT) Matthew, is this all\nNYSSA: because I said no?\nNYSSA: 73\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 74\nNYSSA: SCENE 29. EXT. DUCKPOND. 18*\" CENTURY.\nNYSSA: Ow!\nGILES: Got to make sure them straps is tight. Don't want you swimming to safety do we?\nNYSSA: So what exactly does Trial By Water involve?\nGILES: We put you to the water. If you drown, then you’re not a witch. If you survive, you're a witch and we burn you.\nNYSSA: What happens if I confess?\nGILES: We burn you.\nNYSSA: There’s not really much in this for me. (WEARY BREATH) Shall we get on with it?\nCROWD: (CONSTERNATION. “She be a saucy one!”, “Oooh, she speaks with Satan’s tongue” etc.)\nGILES: (CALLS OUT) Raise the ducking stool!\nBROTHERS: (HISSING) Sabbayoth! Feed! Feed! Sabbayoth!\nCROWD: \"It be the Brotherhood!\" \"Come to rescue one of their own!\" \"I knew it!\" Etc.\nNYSSA: Is that the Brotherhood of Sabbayoth? Oh, I’ve been trying to speak to them. Could one of them come over here?\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 75\nGILES: Don’t let her — they’1ll rescue her straight to hell. Lower the ducking stool. Now!\nBROUGHT: UP, GASPING, TO JEERS FROM THE CROWD.\nGILES: Cold, missy? It’ll be warm enough for you where you're going!\nNYSSA: Matthew! Please! Stop this! Please!\nMRS STUBBS: Vicar won’t save you now. He’s free of you. Dunk her again!\nNYSSA: WE SEGUE THROUGH THE WATER, AND NYSSA FIGHTING FOR BREATH TO...\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 76\nNYSSA: SCENE 30. EXT. GALLOWGATE. 19*\" CENTURY.\nNOOSE: BEING FITTED ROUND ADRIC’S THROAT.\nJAILER: There she goes. Nice and tight. Any last words, young sir before you drop through the trap door?\nADRIC: Yes. Can we wait a few more minutes? The Doctor specialises in last-minute rescues.\nJAILER: We've wasted enough time as it is (SHOUTING TO SOMEONE) Right, this one’s ready. Let her go.\nADRIC: No! Please, nooo!\nADRIC: THROUGH.\nCROWD: END OF EPISODE TWO.\nCROWD: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 77\nCROWD: EPISODE THREE\nCROWD: SCENE 31. EXT. GALLOWGATE. 21°* CENTURY.\nLEANNE: (IN GUIDE MODE) In those times, journalists would write up hangings for the local newspapers. I know, ladies and gentlemen, quite different from lost dogs and scout huts.\nLEANNE: But the journalist here that day in 1804 got quite the story — of a condemned boy who frightened away the ghosts who came to watch him die. The oddest thing about it — the boy’s name. Would anyone care to guess it?\nLEANNE: The boy who frightened ghosts was called Derek.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Hang on.\nLEANNE: (LOUD) The journalist’s account of the events of that day is remarkable — I’ve a photocopy here.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Let me see that.\nLEANNE: (OVER HIM) You’re welcome to have a look, ladies and gentlemen.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I'm trying to read it. Would you mind not waving it about so much?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 78\nLEANNE: (HISS, OVER) Yes I would. (SMILES) It’s a remarkable story — of ghosts and a strange order of monks. It’s quite Dan Brown. But the writer believed it. His editor believed it enough to publish it.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’m sorry, but your thumb is over the end of it.\nLEANNE: (HISS) Not now. (CLEARS THROAT) And, unless you want to look at the post where they pulled out people’s tongues, that’s all for this afternoon’s free walking tour. But, if you come back in half an hour, we’ve our evening tour — around the Catacombs of Death.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Is that really what they’re called?\nLEANNE: (HISS) Shut up! (BRIGHTLY) Ladies and gentlemen, please join us.\nLOUIE: (DISTANT BELLOW) Why wait till this evening ladies and gentlemen? When I, Magister Louix, can immediately offer you a candlelit tour of the graves beneath the cathedral? My ghosts are, I assure you, very splendid, utterly real, and guaranteed heartstopping. My tour leaves immediately — why not tag along? Tag along. Come! That’s right, follow the cape everyone, follow the cape!\nLOUIE: CLIENTS WITH HIM.\nLEANNE: Damn him. He’s stolen all my clients. That’s my evening's earnings gone.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’m sorry.\nLEANNE: I mean, honestly, how does anyone take him seriously? All dressed in black with a pointy beard? Who buys that stuff?\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 79\nDOCTOR: (F.) Hmmmn .\nLEANNE: Anyway, I’m not speaking to you.\nDOCTOR: (F.) But you are.\nLEANNE: You're ruining my business.\nDOCTOR: (F.) But I would have thought having a ghost on a ghost tour would have been an advantage.\nLEANNE: You’re not a ghost — you’re a hallucination, or an inner ear infection or hypnosis.\nDOCTOR: (F.) You lead ghost walks for a living and you don’t believe in ghosts?\nLEANNE: Do you?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Well, no.\nLEANNE: And you’re a ghost!\nDOCTOR: (F.) I admit it’s taking self-doubt to extremes. Look, I’m the Doctor. And I’m hoping you can help me.\nLEANNE: Why on earth should I help you? You’re putting me out of business. My takings are right down — look at this place. The Square is empty. Normally you can rely on at least three bewildered but tractable tourists. Nothing. Word’s got around. They tend not to pay money to people who talk to themselves.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Pity. That’s normally when I do my best thinking. Can’t you pretend to be talking to something? Have you a mobile phone or robot dog? I find they help.\nLEANNE: (LONG SIGH) Right then. I’m setting off. Maybe I’11 pick up some punters along the way.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nLEANNE: 80\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 81\nLEANNE: SCENE 32. EXT. HARROWS ROW. 21°* CENTURY.\nLEANNE: SPIEL IN THE HOPE OF PICKING UP CUSTOM. NO ONE'S BITING.\nLEANNE: And here we are on Harrows Row. This house is remarkable because it has two fronts. We’ll see the other side of it at the end of the tour, down the hill. This house has had many uses over the years, and was long abandoned. Eventually it was split up into flats. It was when that happened that all the new tenants started to report seeing — unexplained phenomena.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Ghosts?\nLEANNE: (MUCH LESS PUBLIC) Mysterious cloaked figures. Apparitions. Lost postmen. Do you care?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Well, yes.\nLEANNE: Why are you in my head?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Are you on medication?\nLEANNE: Wait. The voice in my head is questioning my sanity?\nDOCTOR: (F.) It’s a serious question, are you on medication?\nLEANNE: Well, no. I’ve just stopped taking beta-blockers.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Adrenergenic inhibitors? Curious. Why?\nLEANNE: I was having driving lessons. They stopped me shaking during three point turns.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Interesting. So I could have been in your head for a while and you’re only now beginning to notice me. (THOUGHT STRIKES) Did you pass?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 82\nLEANNE: What? Yes. Fifth time. The examiner gave me a hug and a wagon wheel.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Congratulations. Can we go inside?\nLEANNE: What? Oh, the flats. No. The owners don’t even like us hanging around in the streets outside. Says it scares the tenants. So we stand outside making up stories about headless nuns and dead babies.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’d like a look inside.\nLEANNE: Can’t you float through the door?\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’m not that sort of ghost. I’m more of a.. well, a presence in your mind. I suppose. Look, I’ve never been a ghost before.\nLEANNE: Right.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Can’t you knock on the door?\nLEANNE: I’ve said no. Anyway, we can look in the other side — it’s the end of the tour, where the catacombs are.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Catacombs. Interesting.\nLEANNE: You keep saying “Fascinating” this and “Interesting” that.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Do I?\nLEANNE: You’re trying to make it sound like you’ve got a clever theory and really you’re baffled.\nLEANNE: Aren’t you?\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 83\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: Baffled is a little harsh. (THINKS) Now, you run a tour of the most haunted places in the city. Maybe I’m not the only ghost. Maybe there’s another connection. Everything here must be somehow linked. Ah well. It’1ll come to me. Where next?\nLEANNE: We call it The Lake Of The Haunted Witch.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Sounds delightful.\nLEANNE: (HEADING OFF) So, what happened to you — you know, down in the Catacombs?\nDOCTOR: (F. HEADING OFF) How did I die? Well it's rather interest— (STOPS HIMSELF) peculiar.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 84\nDOCTOR: SCENE 33. INT. CATACOMBS. 17th CENTURY.\nWALKING: IN.\nTEGAN: (STIRRING) Doctor...? Where have you been?\nDOCTOR: Tegan! How are you feeling?\nTEGAN: Pretty weak. Like I’ve got the flu.\nDOCTOR: Nasty. I tried getting a cold once. Just to see what the fuss was about.\nTEGAN: (CUT THE CRAP) Did you have any luck with the entrance?\nDOCTOR: Not as such, no. The whole top of the staircase has been filled in. Lots of bricks and very little mortar to chip away at. Our best bet is an earthquake.\nTEGAN: Won’t it just fall on top of us?\nDOCTOR: I said it was our best bet. Not that it was a good one.\nTEGAN: There’s got to be a way out of here. What about the water that’s dripping everywhere? Pipework? Drains? Sewers?\nDOCTOR: The water's just seeping from the streets I'm afraid. I'd imagine we’re beneath the layer cake of roadlaying geology. This water’s probably gone through cobbles, ash, gravel, slabs, perhaps even a Roman Road. Each layer a tribute to the people who made it.\nTEGAN: If only one of them had left a pickaxe lying around...\nDOCTOR: I’m going to go have another look. Maybe there’s something in one of the vaults. (PAUSE, SERIOUS) If there’s anything you need... you will shout, won’t you?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 85\nTEGAN: Have you met me?\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nTEGAN: Hey, Doctor! I've just thought of something! Doctor? (TO HERSELF) Unbelievable! (GETS UP, IT IS SLOW AND PAINFUL) There’ll be a pickaxe in the TARDIS. Won’t there? Of course there will be. Ah well. (WALKS TOWARDS THE SHIP WITH EFFORT) If you need a job doing properly, get an air stewardess to do it.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 86\nTEGAN: SCENE 34. INT. TARDIS. 17th CENTURY.\nTEGAN: INTO THE CONSOLE ROOM.\nTEGAN: Emergency exits are located here and here. Oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling, and, if you require a pickaxe, just press the call button and we will be only too happy to find your nearest one for you. (SHE STOPS AND SHIVERS) It’s so cold in here. And dark. (SHE FLICKS SOME SWITCHES ON THE CONSOLE) Dead as a doornail. Poor old console.\nTEGAN: THE CORRIDOR. SHAKES HER TORCH.\nTEGAN: The storeroom should be along here. Rabbits. This torch is going. Maybe I’1l find some batteries next to the pickaxe.\nTEGAN: The storeroom! Right first time. Gosh, I'm good.\nTEGAN: Hello?\nTEGAN: Is someone there?\nSABBAYOTH: (SOFT, LOW) Is someone there?\nTEGAN: Who are you?\nSABBAYOTH: Who are you?\nTEGAN: (TO HERSELF) Pull yourself together woman. Don’t be frightened.\nSABBAYOTH: Be frightened!\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 87\nTEGAN: (SHAKEN) Ohhhkay.\nTEGAN: FX. SHE BEGINS BACKING AWAY.\nTEGAN: I’m going to go outside and get the Doctor. He’1ll know what to do.\nTEGAN: FX. OPENS DOOR TO CONSOLE ROOM.\nTEGAN: See? Here we are back in the console room. I'll just go through the main doors and fetch the Doc[tor]—\nTEGAN: FX. THE DOORS SLAM SHUT.\nTEGAN: (SHOUTING AS THE DOORS SHUT) Doctor! Doctor!\nSABBAYOTH: Doctor! Doctor!\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 88\nSABBAYOTH: SCENE 35. INT. CATACOMBS. 17th CENTURY. (CONT. )\nSABBAYOTH: FX. THE DOCTOR IS WALKING ALONG WHEN HE HEARS TEGAN’S DISTANT SHOUT FROM THE PREVIOUS SCENE CUT OFF BY THE TARDIS DOORS\nSLAMMING: SHUT.\nDOCTOR: Tegan!\nDOCTOR: FX. HE RUNS.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, I’m coming! (IRRITATED) The TARDIS. What is she doing\nDOCTOR: in there?\nDOCTOR: FX. STOPS RUNNING. HE RATTLES THE TARDIS DOOR. IT DOESN'T OPEN.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) It’s locked.\nDOCTOR: FX. TRIES KEY IN LOCK.\nDOCTOR: My key’s not working.\nDOCTOR: FX. HE RATTLES IT SOME MORE.\nDOCTOR: (PANICKED, SHOUTING) Tegan, stay calm — I’m coming. (TO HIMSELF) Somehow.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 89\nDOCTOR: SCENE 36. INT. TARDIS. 17th CENTURY\nFOCUS: IS ON TEGAN AND WHAT IS WITH HER.\nFOCUS: NB: SABBAYOTH IS FLAT. IT IS NOT A GLOATING SUPERVILLAIN.\nTEGAN: You’re the creature — the alien that’s down here?\nSABBAYOTH: Yes. I’m the creature — the alien that’s down here.\nTEGAN: But how can you speak? The Doctor said you were too alien to be chatty.\nSABBAYOTH: I can speak to you because of this machine. It contains systems which translate. I consumed them, so they are part of me.\nTEGAN: Okay.\nSABBAYOTH: Even though this machine is dead, it is strong. Capable of so much.\nTEGAN: But what about you? What do you want?\nSABBAYOTH: To be reborn. I have travelled far, been asleep so long.\nTEGAN: And, when you are “reborn”. What will you be like?\nSABBAYOTH: Hungry. I shall walk this world and I shall devour it.\nTEGAN: Great.\nSABBAYOTH: Yes. I shall be great. (PAUSE) Would you like to see?\nTEGAN: See what?\nSABBAYOTH: Your own time. I can sense your loss. When are you from?\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 90\nTEGAN: (SHRUGS) I’m from 1980. More or less.\nSABBAYOTH: A good time. Shortly before I return. I shall prove it to you.\nTEGAN: Go on.\nSABBAYOTH: (SMILES) This machine needs a little power to send you there. I shall take your strength, and use it for that.\nSABBAYOTH: FX. AS TEGAN GASPS, THE TARDIS GROANS.\nTEGAN: (GASPS) What — are — you — doing — to — me?\nSABBAYOTH: Sending your spirit ahead to your own time. You shall be my anchor.\nTEGAN: What? What are you doing? No!\nTEGAN: ENGINES.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 91\nTEGAN: SCENE 37. INT. HOUSE. 20th CENTURY\nCLEAR: JUST VOICES TAKEN FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE RECORDING, DISTORTED, ECHOED AND TURNED INTO A CHAOTIC SOUNDSCAPE. THIS IS THE FLIPSIDE TO SCENE 47.

I cast you out!\nJUST: ENOUGH THAT, WHEN PEOPLE DO GET THERE (OR ON A SECOND LISTEN) IT MATCHES UP.\nJUST: OVER THE TOP, TEGAN'S WORDS WHICH ALSO ECHO, SO WE’RE NOT\nQUITE: SURE IN WHICH ORDER SHE SAYS THEM...\nTEGAN: (AGONY) Listen to me. Please! It’s tearing me apart. You’ve got to listen. Sabbayoth is coming. Sabbayoth. Listen to me — you’ve got to be ready. It waits underneath. You’ve got to stop it. Find the Doctor. He’1ll know what to do. No. Listen to me. You don’t understand. (SHOUTING) My name’s Tegan Jovanka!\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 92\nTEGAN: SCENE 38. INT. TARDIS. 17th CENTURY\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Tegan! (SKIDS TO A HALT, FINDING HER ON THE FLOOR) Tegan!\nSABBAYOTH: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What have you done to her?\nSABBAYOTH: I did what you could not. She wanted to get back to her own time. I sent her.\nDOCTOR: But — look at her. (TAPPING HER FACE) Come on, Tegan, come on. Wake up. Stay with me.\nSABBAYOTH: These creatures. They have so little energy.\nDOCTOR: What are you? How could you do this to her?\nSABBAYOTH: It is what I do. There is so little of her left. But you...\nSABBAYOTH: There is more to feed on in you.\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 93\nSABBAYOTH: SCENE 39. INT. CATACOMB ENTRANCE. 21st CENTURY\nLEANNE: Doctor, sure you want to go back down the Catacombs? Considering you died in them?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Returning to the scene of the crime always provides a certain eLaritys:\nLEANNE: Doesn’t it creep you out? (PAUSE) I’ve never been down here alone before.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’ve spent all too much time on my own down here.\nLEANNE: How much do you remember?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Not enough to be of any practical help.\nLEANNE: Has your spirit really been — I dunno — floating around here for centuries, haunting other people?\nDOCTOR: (F.) That would be interesting, wouldn’t it? Not sure.\nLEANNE: Surely they’d have found your body when they first cleared the catacombs out, got them ready for tourists?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Corpses lying around could lead to negative reviews. Ah, here we are. Would you mind terribly tapping that wall?\nLEANNE: This one?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Yes. But tap it. Go on.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nDOCTOR: HOLLOW.\nLEANNE: It’s — hollow — here.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Yes. Thought so. If you look at the brickwork, it’s cruder. Look up — around there? See? This was an archway.\nLEANNE: There’s a chamber bricked up behind this wall?\nDOCTOR: (F.) It’s my tomb.\nLEANNE: What?\nDOCTOR: (F.) You were asking about my body. I was just trying to be helpful.\nLEANNE: Okay. This fire extinguisher should do it.\nLEANNE: IT — WHACK! — AGAINST THE WALL.\nDOCTOR: (F.) No! No! No! Stop!\nLEANNE: What? I’m uncovering your body. Isn’t that what you want?\nDOCTOR: (F.) No. I'm sorry, but this is where it becomes complicated. Now. I’m currently dead, yes?\nLEANNE: Yes.\nDOCTOR: (F.) And yet you can hear my voice as though I’m still alive. And neither of us believes in ghosts. So, if I'm not a ghost, I must still alive.\nLEANNE: (UNCERTAIN) I suppose so.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Perhaps I’ve found a way out of my tomb. Perhaps not. But\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 95\nDOCTOR: maybe there's just enough doubt at a quantum level for me to still be able to talk to you.\nLEANNE: I’m not sure I get this-\nDOCTOR: (F.) I’m Schrodinger’s Ghost. Currently it’s possible that I’m dead AND alive. Break down that wall and there’s only one possibility. And, if as I very much suspect, it’s that I’m dead, then I’m afraid that’1ll be the last of me.\nLEANNE: No more voice in my head?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Probably not. And no chance of me sorting this out. My death will be fixed.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 96\nDOCTOR: SCENE 40. INT. CATACOMBS. 17th CENTURY\nTEGAN: (WEAK) Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, thank heavens.\nTEGAN: The TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got you out of there, away from that creature.\nTEGAN: I could feel it - hungry.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nTEGAN: When it finally comes back — it’1l devour the Earth. It sent me there — to the future — I tried to warn them. I failed. I think.\nDOCTOR: What did you tell them?\nTEGAN: I’m not sure. So tired.\nDOCTOR: You'll get your strength back.\nTEGAN: No. I won’t. I could feel it feeding on me. That creature — what is it?\nDOCTOR: There are distant galaxies — far out in space and time. Whole sectors of space that are dark. No suns, no life, no energy. Drained. Like they were born and died unimaginable aeons ago. Only there hasn't been enough time for that to happen...\nTEGAN: Sabbayoth...?\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 97\nDOCTOR: Maybe. Imagine a creature that turns a whole cosmos dark, and then leaps on to the next. It’ll arrive exhausted. It’1ll take time to regrow. But it will.\nTEGAN: Just like a really slow game of hopscotch.\nDOCTOR: Clearly I’ve been getting the rules wrong.\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS, PAINFUL) Yes. (SIGHS) The future - I tried to tell them to find you.\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind. But I might not be around by then.\nTEGAN: Aren’t you like 8,000 years old?\nDOCTOR: Not quite.\nTEGAN: You'll get out, Doc. You always do.\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, Tegan. I’m not feeling too clever myself.\nTEGAN: You're starting to look your age.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nTEGAN: About time too! Cheer up, Doc. Promise me you’1ll get out.\nDOCTOR: T’1ll try.\nTEGAN: Thanks. (SIGHS) I’m so tired.\nDOCTOR: No, Tegan. Stay awake. You’ve got to.\nTEGAN: Dog-tired.\nTEGAN: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 98\nDOCTOR: Don’t go, Tegan. Please. You’re rather fun to have around.\nTEGAN: So are you, Doctor. (SMILES) So are you. (LONG SIGHING, DYING\nBREATH: )\nDOCTOR: Tegan...?\nDOCTOR: THERE. HIS VOICE ECHOING AFTER US.\nDOCTOR: (ECHOES) Oh Tegan.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 99\nDOCTOR: SCENE 41. INT. CATACOMBS. 21st CENTURY\nLEANNE: I’m sorry about your friend.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Thank you.\nLEANNE: And now I understand why you’re haunting me — somehow, you want me to save you all.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Well, that would be nice, but that’s really not it.\nLEANNE: (SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED) Oh. But. Somewhere down here, in these catacombs, is the solution to this whole mystery.\nDOCTOR: (F.) That's not it either. It’s more like the entire city has spent the last few centuries becoming the mystery.\nLEANNE: And you’re the key to it?\nDOCTOR: (F.) No, you are.\nLEANNE: What?\nDOCTOR: (F.) You're not here to save me — I’m here to save you.\nLEANNE: Me?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Yes. (PAUSE) We’re no longer alone down here. Listen.\nBROTHERS: (OFF, DRAWING IN)\nWIND: COMING CLOSER.\nLEANNE: What the hell?\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 100\nDOCTOR: (F.) This may seem like the wrong time to bring it up, but have you ever heard of the Brotherhood of Sabbayoth?\nLEANNE: Not really.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Fascinating really. A secluded religious order operating in the heart of this city. Ah, here they are...\nSHADOWY: FIGURES SURROUND LEANNE.\nLEANNE: I see. And these men in cloaks who've just appeared from nowhere... they're the Brotherhood of Sabbayoth?\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: Yes. As I was saying, operating in the heart of this city, seemingly untroubled by centuries of religious persecution\nLEANNE: Doctor, what do I do?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Your profession’s an odd one. You take people into dark rooms with a terrible history and you lecture them until they’re scared. What happens when a real ghost appears? You go to pieces.\nLEANNE: Real ghost? You mean these men in cloaks are...\nDOCTOR: (F.) The Brotherhood have never existed. They’re not people. They’re not even cloaks. They’re just wraiths.\nLEANNE: But I can see them!\nDOCTOR: (F.) Look at their feet. (BEAT) They don’t have any.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth... is... hunger...\nLEANNE: Please! Stay back! Please!\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 101\nDOCTOR: (F.) Pull yourself together Leanne. How can you be afraid of something that doesn’t know how to tie its shoelaces?\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth!\nLEANNE: Doctor! Shut up! Please!\nDOCTOR: (F.) They’re a simplistic extrusion into the real world of an idea. Keeping an eye on things for their master. A smoke alarm.

I’m just trying to reassure you that although you perceive the threat it’s merely an apparition.\nLEANNE: Wait. You’re trying to make me less scared of a ghost by telling me it’s just a ghost. EVEN THOUGH I AM SURROUNDED BY GHOSTS?\nDOCTOR: (F.) That was the plan, yes.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth!\nLEANNE: It’s not worked. I've got a better plan.

It’s not clean.\nKATYA: Not my responsibility. That's why we have a cleaning rota.\nMARTIN: And a splendid one at that. I love that you’ve coloured it in. Now, shall we get started?\nMARTIN: FX. MARTIN PLACES THE GLASS ON THE OUIJA BOARD.\nMARTIN: Right. We both put a finger on the glass, like this. If it moves, the spirits will spell out a message.\nKATYA: (GIGGLES) Okay. (SPOOKY) Is there anybody there?\nNOTHING: HAPPENS.\nMARTIN: Let me try. (BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, GHOSTS LISTEN TO MEN) Is there anybody there?\nNOTHING: AGAIN.\nKATYA: Well. So much for the paranormal.

Murdered her.\nSABBAYOTH: No, I simply transferred her energy into myself. Elementary physics. Is it murder when a solid becomes a liquid?\nDOCTOR: You have a lot to learn about how things are in this suburb of the universe.\nSABBAYOTH: I will learn. There are many centuries until my form will manifest.\nDOCTOR: “Manifest”?” You’re one of those. Can’t get your head around how wonderful just being alive is, but oddly at home chuntering on about your “great manifestation” and your “final arising”.\nSABBAYOTH: FX. THE DOCTOR STANDS UP, TEGAN IN HIS ARMS.\nDOCTOR: I’m sealing Tegan away in a stasis chamber. She’s... (HE WANTS TO SAY \"DEAD\", BUT CANNOT) she contains no more energy for you to harvest.\nSABBAYOTH: She has no more value to me.\nSABBAYOTH: INSIDE. HIS SPEECH RUNNING OVER THE ACTION.\nDOCTOR: (PLACING TEGAN'S BODY) Well, that’s one way of putting it. A remarkably selfish one. In the next few years, you should try bumping into a few politicians. You’d get on famously.\nSABBAYOTH: Your words. I do not understand.\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 105\nDOCTOR: Of course you don’t understand. Sometimes, when we’re confronted by terrible things... We smile. It’s called being alive and making the most of it.\nDOCTOR: Brave heart, Tegan. (PAUSE) There.

Me talking to you?\nDOCTOR: Not at all, Sabbayoth. You’re the only company I have. There’s no point in sulking.\nSABBAYOTH: I am beginning to understand how you must feel towards me.\nDOCTOR: Are you?\nSABBAYOTH: That woman. She was your friend?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes she was.\nSABBAYOTH: And this vessel... that we walk through. It was also your friend?\nDOCTOR: My friend and my home. For a very long time.\nSABBAYOTH: It must make you... grieve... to see it dead?\nDOCTOR: Very much.\nSABBAYOTH: And, when I reach full strength, I shall do the same to this world. Will that make you grieve?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (WINCES — HE’S WEAKENING) Although, I’m not sure I’1l be around to see it.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 109\nSABBAYOTH: I cannot stop feeding on you. I regret that.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nSABBAYOTH: Yes. (THINKS. THIS IS DIFFICULT) I have a concept.\nDOCTOR: A concept?\nSABBAYOTH: An offer. If I could make this ship breathe again, you could go away. You would live. And you would not have to grieve when I end the Earth.\nDOCTOR: That’s very kind. (WEARY SIGH) But no. I’1l stay.\nSABBAYOTH: But you will die.\nDOCTOR: Yes. (HE’S REALLY VERY TIRED NOW) It’s a very nice planet. Worth it.\nSABBAYOTH: But death is the end. Look what happened to your friend.\nDOCTOR: Tegan?

Sabbayoth hungers!\nDOCTOR: (F.) (SOFT) Leanne, Leanne, listen to me. Running won’t work. They’re not real and they won’t stop — you can’t outrun them.\nLEANNE: (RUNNING) Shut. Up.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I understand, it’s a primal urge. But you need to confront\nDOCTOR: them. By running you’re just putting yourself in danger.\nLEANNE: How?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Think. You’re off the tourist path. No other tour guides. No exits. There aren’t even any lights here.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Can you retrace your steps?\nLEANNE: What? You think I'm lost? (SHE KNOWS SHE IS)\nDOCTOR: (F.) Does your phone have a torch on it?\nLEANNE: Yes.\nLEANNE: FX. SHE ACTIVATES IT.\nLEANNE: There.\nDOCTOR: (F.) No signal down here, I suppose?\nLEANNE: (CHECKS) No.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 111\nDOCTOR: (F.) Too much to hope.\nLEANNE: All the time you were down here... did you find another way out?\nDOCTOR: (F.) (SMILES) No.\nBROTHERS: (DISTANT) Sabbayoth. Is. Hunger.\nLEANNE: The light. On my phone...\nDOCTOR: (F.) Going dim. I know.\nLEANNE: (LOOKING AROUND, PANICKING) And this tunnel is a dead end.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I wish they wouldn’t call them that.\nLEANNE: Doctor, what do I do? Why are they interested in me?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Sabbayoth needs a psychic anchor, to pull himself fully into this world. It’ll have been on the look-out for one over the centuries. Potential subjects will have come and gone. But only now, now that it’s ready, a great mass of potential energy hovering just outside our world... only now does it really need one. And Leanne, I’m afraid it’s you.\nLEANNE: Me?\nDOCTOR: (F.) You have a unique connection to it.\nLEANNE: How?\nDOCTOR: (F.) There are other anchors in this city. And you’ve walked between the site of them — all connected with Sabbayoth. Over and over. Wearing a groove in reality.\nLEANNE: Oh god.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid it’s that simple.\nBROTHERS: (CLOSE) Sabbayoth.

But it is coming back. I can feel it!\nFR. ANGELO: That is often the way. Now, I ask this, not because I doubt you, but because I must know how strong you are before we fight this together. Is there are history of mental... difficulties.. in your family?\nMARTIN: (HOT) She’s not mad.\nFR. ANGELO: Katya — My question?\nKATYA: No.\nFR. ANGELO: That’s fine. Take my hand.

Come along.\nTOURIST: 3: Do you have any tickets left for today's tour?\nLOUIE: (PAUSE, TO A TOURIST) No madam, alas, we’re fully sold out for today. There are other tours. But everything you’ve heard about them is sadly true... (PUBLIC) My party — this way!\nTOURIST: APPROACHES LEANNE.\nTOURIST: 3: Excuse me?\nLEANNE: Yes?\nTOURIST: 3: Do you do ghost tours?\nLEANNE: Yes. We have one leaving in 5 minutes.\nTOURIST: 3: Where do I stand? I can’t see the queue...\nLEANNE: (WEAK SMILE) We have sold other tickets, of course we have. But sometimes, people don’t show up.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 117\nTOURIST: 3: Only, the other man — Magister Louie, he said something about your tour.\nLEANNE: Did he?\nTOURIST: 3 Yes.\nLEANNE: Ah.\nDOCTOR: (F.) If I might have a word?\nLEANNE: No!\nTOURIST: 3: Excuse me?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Is now a bad time?\nLEANNE: Shut up! Go away! You left me to die!\nTOURIST: 3: I did nothing of the—\nLEANNE: How many times — go away!\nTOURIST: 3: Gladly.\nLEANNE: Not you, you idiot, come back. Please! (SIGH)\nDOCTOR: (F.) Ah. Sorry. Didn’t mean to get in the way.\nLEANNE: (IGNORING) Take a flyer! Ghost tour — one leaving in 5 minutes and then there’s our Midnight Murder March! Please, someone, take a flyer.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I can understand why you might be cross with me.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 118\nLEANNE: You left me alone, in the dark, with those things.\nDOCTOR: (F.) It wasn’t my choice. You became so frightened that the latent telepathic channels in your brain became overloaded.\nLEANNE: You’re using long words to make this my fault?!?!\nDOCTOR: (F.) Not exactly\nLEANNE: Anyway, I got out of there without you. I didn’t need you.\nDOCTOR: (F.) You were supposed to.\nLEANNE: What?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Something needed access to your brain and I was just getting in the way.\nLEANNE: Ain't that the truth.\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: Since last night, I’ve had a chance to think things through and examine the various accounts of the hauntings. (CLEARS THROAT) I used your phone while you were asleep.\nLEANNE: You did what?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Sorry about that. (SMILES) Still, at least we’re talking again!\nLEANNE: You're talking.\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: Ah. Quite. So, remember my companions - the ones I sent off into history? Well, I now know where they ended up — as stops on your ghost tour. Those psychic anchors I mentioned last night. Even Tegan makes an appearance — fascinating really. Still, the interaction between artron energy and psychospoor would be like candy floss to Sabbayoth.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 119\nLEANNE: Please shut up. I’ve never been more scared than I was last night.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Again, I’m sorry. And I’m afraid it’s going to get worse.\nLEANNE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: (F.) I think Sabbayoth is just about ready to make its grand entrance. Last night it planted a trigger in your brain.\nLEANNE: Seriously?\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: (PRESSING ON) Whatever you do, you cannot go down into the catacombs tonight.\nLEANNE: Doctor, listen to me. It’s my job, okay? I’m already in trouble — ticket sales are down, Magister Louie’s telling everyone that I’m nuts. I’m going down the vaults tonight or I won't be able to pay my rent tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: (F.) There might not be a world tomorrow.\nLEANNE: That all sounds very grand but — even if the world ends, my landlord is still going to want his money. That's why I’m standing, in the rain, for hours, handing out flyers. It’s the dull things that get you.\nDOCTOR: (F.) (LONG, SAD BREATH) It is, isn’t it? All right. I can’t stop you. But you’ll be putting yourself in terrible danger.\nLEANNE: Yeah, right.\nDOCTOR: (F.)\nDOCTOR: Look around you — look at the street. There’s less traffic than yesterday, isn’t there? Fewer people? And a slight tang in the air. That’s Sabbayoth. Already the world is sensing its arrival.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 120\nDOCTOR: SOUNDS OF THE STREET HAVE FADED AWAY WITHOUT OR NOTICING —\nLEAVING: JUST THE RAIN.\nDOCTOR: (F.) This is how the world ends Leanne. On a rainy day.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 121\nDOCTOR: SCENE 49. INT. CATACOMBS. 17th CENTURY\nACROSS: BRICKS.\nSABBAYOTH: Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Sabbayoth, you’ve been quiet for ever so long. When your erstwhile worshippers sealed this place up, they left most of their building materials on this side of the divide. So I’m building a wall. Bricklaying’s a good hobby to have, you know. Calming. Churchill was a big fan you know.\nSABBAYOTH: Why are you doing this?\nDOCTOR: I’m dying, Sabbayoth. But I’m doing a bit of tidying up first. At some point, someone’s going to come down here. I can’t have them finding the skeleton of a Time Lord, or an abandoned time machine. It could all end very badly.\nDOCTOR: So, I'm sealing myself away. It’s very neat.\nDOCTOR: And there we go, wall finished. Must rest. (HE LEANS BACK, EXHAUSTED) Not much energy left. My mind’s still sharp, but this body is threadbare.\nSABBAYOTH: You have sustained me.\nDOCTOR: Yes I have, sadly. (WIPES FOREHEAD) How long... how long have I been down here?\nDOCTOR: No answer? Thought not. Time has no meaning for you does it? The drips from the ceiling tell me only that it’s raining upstairs. Not the time of day, not the season even — still less the year. Or should that be century?\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 122\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) So tired. (FROWNS) Tegan — when you flung her spirit forward, you used the telepathic circuits, and (RALLYING) you couldn’t have done that unless the TARDIS is still here in the future. So my bricklaying worked. Good to know. (LIES BACK, SPENT) Should do something with that. (PAUSE) Funny really. Always had hoped to die on a sunny day. Ah well. (LONG SIGH, IN EFFECT HIS DYING BREATH).\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 123\nDOCTOR: SCENE 50. INT. CAFE. 21st CENTURY\nDOCTOR: BABIES. BUT ALSO, IT’S QUITE QUIET. THERE’S A HOSPITAL ECHO TO\nTHIS: CAFE.\nLOCAL RADIO: (D.)\nLOCAL RADIO: And Janice there, calling in to say she’s no power either. We also heard from Brian who claims none of the cars in the Market Street car park will start. Are you affected by the mysterious blackouts? Call in. Unless of course, your radio has been affected too! (LITTLE DJ LAUGH) More after this...\nLOCAL RADIO: FX. RADIO FADES RIGHT INTO THE BACKGROUND AS WE MOVE TO LEANNE AND THE DOCTOR.\nLEANNE: So, that’s how you died?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Sort of.\nLEANNE: Do you ever answer anything with a yes or a no?\nDOCTOR: (F.) You’ve not asked me about tea.\nLEANNE: Do you like tea?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Depends.\nLEANNE: GROANS\nDOCTOR: (F.) Are you having the last of that scotch egg?\nLEANNE: No. I’m full.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Pity. I do like a scotch egg. So. Listen. I couldn’t help you last night. But I can now.\nLEANNE: And you expect me to trust you? After last time? Seriously?\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 124\nDOCTOR: (F.) Sabbayoth will come through tonight.\nLEANNE: Or maybe he won’t. Doctor, I’m being polite. I’ve had enough of ghosts. Please. Leave me alone.\nDOCTOR: (F.) I see. (A SIGH) Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: ANOTHER.\nLEANNE: What’s going on?\nLEANNE: Doctor is this you?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Drastic measures. Sorry. Will you help me?\nLEANNE: You’re a poltergeist now?\nDOCTOR: (F.) Quite an impressive one. Help me?\nLEANNE: No.\nDOCTOR: (F.) Very well.\nDOCTOR: CONSTERNATION AND SCREAMING IN THE CAFE.

Leanne, don’t do this — please — nooo!\nLEANNE: (OVERLAPPING) Go away!\nLEANNE: NOISE.

NIGHT. 21st CENTURY.\nLEANNE: CROWS.\nLOUIE: (OFF-DUTY, SO HIS ACCENT IS A BIT BRUM) Power’s off over most of the city. They were saying the hospital’s lit by candles.\nLEANNE: Very Florence Nightingale.\nLOUIE: And I hear you were lucky not to be arrested.\nLEANNE: Please, Louie. Let’s not go into it.\nLOUIE: They said it was like something from Poltergeist. Wish I’d seen it.\nLEANNE: (FIRM) Stop it. It’s been a tough few days.\nLOUIE: (BIT PLUMMIER) My dear Leanne, I’m just teasing. But, is it voices in your head, or are all the demons of hell chasing you?\nLEANNE: Suppose I really was in touch with ghosts. Suppose I can blow up a café with my mind.. Should you really be winding me up?\nLOUIE: But... my dear... (THE ACT DROPS COMPLETELY FOR A MOMENT) Are you okay?\nLEANNE: No.\nLOUIE: (TRUCE OVER) Well, looks like you won’t have to worry about your Midnight Tour. No-one’s here.\nLEANNE: Yeah. No punters for you to steal.\nLOUIE: The very idea! No. All mine are waiting for me in St David's Churchyard. Just wanted to... ah... make sure... you were... all right.\nLOUIE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 127\nLEANNE: Thanks.\nLOUIE: Hey hey! Looks like I spoke too soon. Over there — Punters. Don't worry — I won't pinch them. I'm full for tonight anyhow. (LOUD) Fancy dress! I like it. I like it. (APPLAUDS) Well done on making the effort, all of you. Love the cloaks. You’1l be in safe hands with Leanne here. Well, must be getting along. Can't leave my Germans in the graveyard too long. See you!\nLEANNE: See you. (DEEP BREATH. SHE IS BEING BRAVE) I take it you’re the Brotherhood.\nLEANNE: A BEAT OF SILENCE, NO RESPONSE.\nLEANNE: I know what you want. I’ll take you down the catacombs. I’ve\nLEANNE: no choice really, have I?\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 128\nLEANNE: SCENE 52. INT. CATACOMBS. 21st CENTURY\nBEHIND: HER, JUST A WHISPER OF SPOOKY NOISE.\nLEANNE: (TOUR GUIDE VOICE, SHAKEN) .. The Catacombs. Now has anyone heard the story of these catacombs? (PAUSE SILENCE)\nLEANNE: Anyone? Really? No? A long time ago something terrible and alien arrived here — and, over the years, it was worshipped. They called it Sabbayoth. They called themselves the Brotherhood because, well, men. Now, would anyone like to guess at what happened to these worshippers?\nLEANNE: (SILENCE) No. Shame. I’m sort of guessing they waited for Sabbayoth to grow stronger. And, as time passed, it consumed them until they faded away to wraiths. But they didn’t stop believing. Which is nice.\nLEANNE: HALLS.\nLEANNE: Did you know, the building above us used to belong to the Brotherhood? Then it became flats. And the students in one flat decided to play with a Ouija board. What they heard that night led them to rediscover the basement. Which is this series of passages running under the entire street.\nSACRIFICIAL: CHAMBER.\nLEANNE: Now then, let’s turn left and step through here.\nLEANNE: FX. CROSS TO INSIDE THE CHAMBER.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 129\nLEANNE: SCENE 53. INT. CATACOMB TEMPLE. 21st CENTURY. (CONT. )\nLEANNE: Let me know when you want me to stop the tour, won’t you?\nLEANNE: Okay. Well, when the catacombs were uncovered this chamber was found. It has long puzzled people, but I guess we can call it the Temple of Sabbayoth. (BRIGHT) And then, of course, there are these little stones, all in a circle. Now, what do you think they are, eh? (BEAT) I guess this point marks the spot where Sabbayoth arrived, all those years and years ago. Also, you know, the bit where the Doctor tried to save his friends — which probably made things more complicated. But there we are. (DEEP, BRAVE BREATH) So. Any questions?\nLEANNE: I mean, I’m guessing this is it, right? That thing you worship is about to be reborn. And you need me to help do it. What about the Doctor — was that you? Was there even a Doctor? Or just a voice in my head. Misleading me?\nLEANNE: I could try and run. But what’s the point? You’ve had centuries to shape this city. And I’m just one person.\nSHE: IS SHOVED\nLEANNE: (REACTING) A shove? That was definitely a shove. So you’ve body enough when your boss needs something.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth!\nLEANNE: You want me to in the circle. I'd rather not, if it's all the same.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth is coming. Sabbayoth demands it.\nBROTHERS: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 130\nLEANNE: All right. Stop shoving. I’1l do it.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth is coming. You must wait for him in the circle.\nLEANNE: You not joining me? Thought not. You're just going to leave me standing here. Alone.\nLEANNE: WIND.\nDOCTOR: (CLEARS THROAT) Actually, you don’t have to be alone.\nLEANNE: Doctor! Is that you? I... I...\nDOCTOR: You imagined I’d be taller. I know. Hello Leanne! Let me just take this cloak off. Sackcloth always smells funny doesn’t it? No wonder these fellows are so dispirited.\nDOCTOR: Oh I know, but now I’m standing inside the circle you can’t touch me. It’d be like opening the oven to see how the Yorkshires are doing. (TUTS) So I’m going to stand beside my friend Leanne and await Sabbayoth. (PAUSES, LISTENS TO THE\nRISING: WIND) He sounds nearly cooked.\nDOCTOR: Any second now, Sabbayoth will turn up and burn this whole world to a cinder. Any. Second. Now. (TUM-TE-TUMS FOR A BIT) I hate this bit. Like waiting for a bus.\nLEANNE: Doctor. You’re really here.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 131\nLEANNE: How come you’re not dead?\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 132\nDOCTOR: SCENE 54. INT. TARDIS. 17‘* CENTURY\nDOCTOR: THE LAST OF THE BRICKS AND WALK INTO THE ECHOING DEAD TARDIS. WE HEAR HIM WALKING AROUND AND THEN, WITH A LONG SIGH, SITTING DOWN.\nDOCTOR: (VOICE OVER) You see, back in the 17 Century... I bricked myself up and went into a healing coma.\nLEANNE: (VOICE OVER) A coma?\nDOCTOR: (VOICE OVER) We can survive like that for hundreds of years —\nLEANNE: (VOICE OVER) We?.\nDOCTOR: (VOICE OVER) My people. I interfaced with my ship’s telepathic circuits to project my consciousness into the future.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 133\nDOCTOR: SCENE 55. INT. CATACOMBS TEMPLE. 21st CENTURY.\nDOCTOR: BROTHERHOOD.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth, Sabbayoth (REPEAT)\nLEANNE: Wait, what?\nDOCTOR: I projected myself into the head of the person Sabbayoth had chosen to bring about its return. You.\nLEANNE: You emailed yourself into my head?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That's a nice analogy. Like a chatty bit of spam.\nLEANNE: But why?\nDOCTOR: You’1ll find out in a moment.\nLEANNE: Here it comes.\nDOCTOR: Yes it does. Hold my hand.\nLEANNE: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m the Doctor. I’m the link you really shouldn’t\nDOCTOR: click. Here it comes. Get ready for the end of the world!\nSABBAYOTH: Sabbayoth!\nLEANNE: FX. SEGUES INTO NEXT SCENE.\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 134\nLEANNE: SCENE 56. INT. CATACOMBS TEMPLE/LEANNE'S HEAD (CONT).\nLEANNE: TO THIS SCENE. THE SOUND OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD BECOMES DULLED AS WE STEP INTO LEANNE'S HEAD SLIGHTLY. LEANNE AND SABBAYOTH\nSOUND: CLEAR, INTIMATE, WHILE THE REST IS ALL SLIGHTLY 'OFF'.\nSABBAYOTH: Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth is risen! Sabbayoth is risen!\nDOCTOR: Leanne! Leanne! Stay calm!\nLEANNE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: If you panic, we’re lost. Stay calm.\nLEANNE: I can’t.\nDOCTOR: If you don’t, an alien force will harvest a vast amount of psychic energy through you and destroy the world.\nLEANNE: That’s not helping.\nSABBAYOTH: I shall be reborn. Even now, I am racing through your brain..\nSABBAYOTH: BRAIN.\nSABBAYOTH: The powers that you have belong to me. You are my focus.\nLEANNE: (TEETH GRITTED) Doctor! It’s tearing my head apart.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth! Sabbayoth!\nSABBAYOTH: You have so much energy in you!\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss\nLEANNE: 135\nLEANNE: (GASPS IN PAIN) Help me! What do I do?\nDOCTOR: (OVER THIS) Leanne, you have to let him into your head.\nLEANNE: (AGONY) Why?\nDOCTOR: (FIRM, HEROIC) Because him.\nLEANNE: (EFFORT) We? Who's we?\nDOCTOR: Open your eyes.\nDOCTOR: FX. A WHOOSH. THE ECHO\nCOMPLETELY: BACK IN THE THE BIG BANG.\nLEANNE: Who are you?\nNYSSA: I'm Nyssa.\nADRIC: Adric.\nTEGAN: Tegan. Hello.\nLEANNE: What? But how?\nDOCTOR: then we have him exactly where we want\nDOCTOR: OF HER SCREAM STOPS AND WE'RE CATACOMBS. A MOMENT OF SILENCE BEFORE\nDOCTOR: Now's not really the time — Here it comes everyone!\nDOCTOR: THE MAELSTROM EXPLODES. WE WHISK AWAY FROM THE SOUND\nDOCTOR: AND THEN CROSSFADE WITH THE NEXT SCENE, AS WE FLASH BACK TO\nDOCTOR: SCENE 50.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 136\nDOCTOR: SCENE 57. INT. TARDIS. 18‘* CENTURY.\nDOCTOR: [FLASHBACK SC 50, SLIGHTLY DREAMY, DISTANT, A MEMORY.\nDOCTOR: THE SHRIEK OF PHONES, THE OCCASIONAL CRASH OF A TEACUP.\nDOCTOR: Noooooo! Leanne, don’t do this — please — nooooo....\nLEANNE: (OVERLAPPING) Go away!\nLEANNE: NOISE. ]\nLEANNE: WITH A GASP. FAINT SOUND OF THE TARDIS HUMMING, IT'S POWER\nSLOWLY: BUILDING.\nDOCTOR: (GASP) Stupid girl! She’s sent me back to the TARDIS. What was she thinking? She’s ruined everything! Why do they never listen? (SIGH) Humans. Now I’m stuck back in my ship before any of it happens and.. no, wait, hang on a second! There’s some light! The power's back!\nDOCTOR: (CHECKING A READOUT) Still a hundred years off, but the TARDIS has recharged. It could work. Let me see — ah yes, still early enough in time for me to get away with it. Oh. Leanne, you are brilliant.\nDOCTOR: SWITCHES. THE TARDIS BEGINS TO DEMATERIALISE\nDOCTOR: For those we are about to deceive... Well, let’s just hope the Time Lords don’t catch me at it.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 137\nDOCTOR: SCENE 58. EXT. DUCKPOND. 18°\" CENTURY\nDOCTOR: [Reprise of Scene 29.\nGILES: Cold, missy? It’ll be warm enough for you where you're going!\nNYSSA: Matthew! Please! Stop this! Please!\nMRS STUBBS: Vicar won’t save you now. He’s free of you. Dunk her again!\nMRS STUBBS: FX. CALM SETTLES ON THE WATER. MATTHEW COMES RUNNING UP.\nMATTHEW: Let her up! Let her up!\nMRS STUBBS: Vicar! Don't lose faith. She’s as black as sin — you said so yourself!\nMATTHEW: She’s innocent! I lied — I lied to save myself. May god forgive me. Stop this at once!\nGILES: Bide another few moments, Reverend. We’re nearly done with washing her sins off in holy water. (CHUCKLES)\nMATTHEW: Let her up, I tell you. Let her up!\nMATTHEW: & GILES:\nMRS STUBBS: It’s too late.\nMRS STUBBS: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 138\nGILES: (RESPONSE SOUND TO BE BEING PUSHED OVER, BREATHLESS FROM THE FIGHT).\nMATTHEW: I’ll do it myself. (GRUNTS/EFFORT AS STRUGGLES TO LIFT THE\nDUCKING: STOOL)\nDUCKING: AND, WITH SOME EFFORT, IT COMES BACK TO THE SURFACE.\nGILES: It’s empty! She’s gone!\nMATTHEW: Nyssa! Oh god forgive me, Nyssa!\nMATTHEW: FX. HE SPLASHES INTO THE POND.\nMATTHEW: Someone — someone help me search the pond. Damn you — search the pond.\nMRS STUBBS: (SOAKED IN PIETY) It’s too late for that, Reverend. (TO THE CROWD) May Jesu blast any of you that spoke against that soul — for she were an Angel and God’s taken her back to Heaven.\nMRS STUBBS: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 139\nMRS STUBBS: SCENE 59. INT. TARDIS. 18° CENTURY.\nCOUGHING: WETLY.\nNYSSA: (CHOKING) Drowning — they were drowning me.\nDOCTOR: I know, Nyssa, I know. I’m so sorry. Just — try to relax. You’ve swallowed a lot of water.\nNYSSA: (WEAK, COUGHING) Humans — they’re horrible. Horrible. I don’t know why you want to help them so much.\nDOCTOR: (SOFT) Not all of them. Here, I brought a warm blanket for you.\nNYSSA: Thank you. Thank you for saving me.\nDOCTOR: It was the least I could do. Also (SMILES WITH GLEE)\nDOCTOR: underwater materialisation!\nNYSSA: (MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE) That’s nice.\nDOCTOR: The next stop’s a bit easier. Needs a steady hand, though.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 140\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60. EXT. GALLOWGATE. 19** CENTURY\nDOCTOR: [REPRISE OF SCENE 30, NOW HEARD FROM UNDERNEATH A CLOSED TRAPDOOR, SO IT IS A LITTLE MUFFLED.\nJAILER: There she goes. Nice and tight. Any last words, young sir before you drop through the trap door?\nADRIC: Yes. Can we wait a few more minutes? The Doctor specialises in last-minute rescues.\nJAILER: We've wasted enough time as it is (SHOUTING TO SOMEONE) Right, this one’s ready. Let her go.\nADRIC: No! Please, nooo!\nADRIC: THROUGH.\nCROWD: (JUBILANT ROAR) ]\nCROWD: FX. AS HE FALLS THROUGH, THE ACOUSTIC CHANGES TO HEAR THE ROAR OF THE CROWD THROUGH THE OPEN TRAPDOOR.\nDOCTOR: Got you!\nADRIC: (HOARSE) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, cut the rope- quickly!\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 141\nDOCTOR: SCENE 61. INT. CATACOMB TEMPLE. 21st CENTURY (FOLLOWS DIRECTLY\nFROM: SCENE 56).\nLEANNE: (PANICKING, SHOUTING) But the four of you! You shouldn’t be here.\nTEGAN: (SHOUTING) No. We should. Now. You do your bit.\nSABBAYOTH: I arise!\nPOURS: INTO THEM.\nBROTHERS: Sabbayoth! Help us! Help us! We are burning!\nSABBAYOTH: Burn! You are mere fuel to be consumed.\nLEANNE: Stop!\nSABBAYOTH: What? What are you doing?\nLEANNE: Fighting back. You put all this power in my head. I’m using it against you.\nLEANNE: (EFFORT) It’s so strong.\nDOCTOR: Stand still, Leanne. Face up to it. We’re here.\nADRIC: You'll have to do most of the work, though.\nADRIC: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 142\nTEGAN: Thanks for the encouraging words, Adric! (TO LEANNE) Leanne, we’re here for you.\nLEANNE: (PAINED) So strong!\nNYSSA: And so are we.\nDOCTOR: (YELLING) Sabbayoth. I’ve moved the goalposts. You’ve used\nDOCTOR: these people as a focus. Used them and discarded them. But\nDOCTOR: they’re here now. Exactly where they shouldn’t be. Fighting back. (TO LEANNE) Leanne. Give him hell!\nLEANNE: (GRUNTING) Sabbayoth? All the power you wanted? Have it. (ROAR OF EFFORT) Have it all.\nSABBAYOTH: Doctor, let me through. I could do so much to this world!\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT, SAD) Yes you could. And perhaps it’s best you don’t get to try. (TO THE OTHERS) Concentrate everyone. Don't let Sabbayoth out of the circle.\nSABBAYOTH: I will become. I shall!\nLEANNE: (EFFORT) No. We don’t want you here.\nSABBAYOTH: The world shall be mine!\nLEANNE: No. (SIGHS) Just go away. (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT AGAIN)\nSABBAYOTH: (AGONY) Mine...!\nSABBAYOTH: (ECHO) Mine... mine... mine...\nSABBAYOTH: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 143\nSABBAYOTH: A MOMENT’S SILENCE.\nDOCTOR: I do hate it when they shout. But it does make it easier. They never think straight when they’re cross.\nNYSSA: (CAUTIONING) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Oh, Leanne. I am sorry. How are you?\nLEANNE: (OVERCOME) It’s just — I’m rather — It’s been a long day.\nADRIC: For all of us.\nTEGAN: Come on, Leanne. Perch on a sacred stone. It’s okay isn’t it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s as harmless as a concrete bollard now.\nLEANNE: Thank you. (SIGHS) How did I do that?\nDOCTOR: (STARTS TO ANSWER) Ah, now...\nNYSSA: (INTERRUPTING) Oh, you shouldn’t ask him that.\nTEGAN: Definitely not.\nADRIC: No. The explaining is often more painful than the actual experience.\nDOCTOR: If you wouldn’t mind. (PAUSE) Earlier you said I emailed myself into your head.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 144\nTEGAN: Email?\nADRIC: Primitive electronic messaging system.\nNYSSA: It’s banned on Traken. Too distracting.\nDOCTOR: (CLEARS THROAT) Anyway, not only did I email myself into your head, but I also included a virus. I implanted a telepathic trigger. Sabbayoth focused all his power into you. And had no idea you could use it against him. Hoist with his own petard.\nLEANNE: And so that’s the end of Sabbayoth?\nDOCTOR: (NOT EXACTLY, BUT THEY NEEDN'T WORRY) Not eaxactly.\nDOCTOR: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 145\nDOCTOR: SCENE 62. INT. CAFE. 21st CENTURY.\nDOCTOR: TALK.\nLOUIE: (OUTSIDE THE CAFE)\nLOUIE: Well, my dear children, I’m sorry we didn’t see any ghosts tonight, but maybe, just maybe, we’1ll have better luck tomorrow. And don't forget, tonight's ticket gives you 50% off tomorrow's tour.\nLOUIE: FX. WE HEAR THEM MOVE AWAY.\nDOCTOR: So... basically, thanks to you, Sabbayoth became untethered.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t so much blow him up as blow him away.\nLEANNE: Like a tent in a storm?\nDOCTOR: You're really good with your analogies!\nTEGAN: Here you go. Have you seen how expensive coffee is in the future? Adric, I got them to make yours with almond milk.\nADRIC: Ooh! Will I like it?\nTEGAN: No.\nADRIC: (VERY DISAPPOINTED) Oh.\nNYSSA: Here, you can have mine.\nLEANNE: You cheated, didn't you Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (PLAYING THE INNOCENT) Cheated?\nLEANNE: Rearranged history so that Nyssa and Adric vanished. And in\nLEANNE: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 146\nLEANNE: such a spectacular manner that legends would spring up about their disappearances.\nDOCTOR: Thus creating two of the stops on your ghost walk.\nTEGAN: But what about me?\nDOCTOR: I lied to Sabbayoth. Told it she was dead, and packed her into a cryopod so that she could heal and it couldn’t feed on her any more.\nTEGAN: And he woke me up immediately after he'd rescued Nyssa and Adric:\nDOCTOR: (LYING) Quite. Almost... Immediately.\nTEGAN: (GLARES) We'll talk about that later. (TO LEANNE) And then we came back to return the favour and rescue you.\nDOCTOR: We put on some cloaks, and tagged along on your ghost walk.\nADRIC: The Brotherhood didn’t even notice us.\nLEANNE: I feel rather sorry for them.\nDOCTOR: Yes. They were all that remained of Sabbayoth’s original worshippers. Over the years their belief ate away at them.\nTEGAN: Nothing to what it would have done to the planet.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nLEANNE: But we’re safe now.\nNYSSA: No Sabbayoth.\nNYSSA: DW-MR-JAN2018- Ghost Walk by James Goss 147\nADRIC: No Brotherhood.\nTEGAN: No poltergeists?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely none. Those were only projections generated by the TARDIS.\nLEANNE: So just to check — I’m no longer psychic?\nDOCTOR: You never were. But it's worse than that, I’m afraid. Now I’ve reset my time machine’s telepathic circuits, that’s the last the city will be seeing of the supernatural. Your life from here on in is going to be a lot more dull.\nLEANNE: (SIPS COFFEE, SMILES) That’s fine by me, Doctor. After all, I’ve never really believed in ghosts."
