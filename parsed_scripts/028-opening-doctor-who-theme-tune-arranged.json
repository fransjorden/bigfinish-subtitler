      "searchable_dialogue": "MAN ON RADIO: ... We present a talk by Professor John Morritz of the University of Minnesota entitled, The New Deal, Where Next. Later, it's a month now since the celebrated meteor lit up our skies. What was it? Where did it go?\nMOUSE: Would you get moving, you great lunk?\nELLIS: Hey, hey! You can't hurry genius, my friend. Know what The Phantom says? There's a fine art to successful chicanery.\nMOUSE: Ah, you don't even know what that means. Besides Ellis, we're breaking into a dime store. This ain't no bank heist. And we shouldn't even be doing this.\nELLIS: I've told you, Mousey, it's just insurance.\nMOUSE: Jeez, if the boss knew we had some of the merchandise...\nELLIS: Yeah well, he ain't gonna know. Not until it's too late anyways.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, it's the historical repercussions, you see. The beat of one bat's wing eventually leads to a tropical storm. That sort of thing. Or was it a butterfly?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: And that's what happened with ... what's his name...\nTHE DOCTOR: Canute. He got a bit above himself, declared himself so powerful, he could turn back the tide.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh yes, I remember reading that somewhere. Listen, we are still heading for Singapore, aren't we?\nTHE DOCTOR: Of course. Now, history records the King getting soggy ankles, but not until I'd intervened. Someone had been meddling.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Who?\nTHE DOCTOR: One TARDIS, one twenty-fourth century Pulfidian Flood Controller, and an amoral Time Lord later, King Canute really did turn back the tide. And our friend had an unshakeable power base in Anglo Saxon Britain. Mucking about with Time is a risky business. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\nELLIS: What's the time?\nMOUSE: Er ... eleven thirty. Ellis?\nELLIS: He should be here.\nHALLIDAY: I'm here.\nMOUSE: Jeez!\nHALLIDAY: You got it?\nELLIS: Yeah. I got it.\nHALLIDAY: Let me see.\nELLIS: Uh-uh. There are two sides to every bargain, old pal of mine. Say...\nHALLIDAY: I'm only asking to see what I'm paying for.\nELLIS: Why don't you step out here into the light, Mister, and we can have a good look at you.\nHALLIDAY: I don't think so.\nMOUSE: Ellis, who is this wise guy?\nELLIS: Out here where I can see you. Or nobody gets nothin’.\nHALLIDAY: Very well.\nELLIS: Hey!\nMOUSE: Oh God...\nHALLIDAY: Let's shed a little light on those pretty mugs of yours. Well, well. Mr Mouse and Mr Ellis. Nice to renew our acquaintance.\nMOUSE: Halliday, we was just...\nELLIS: Shut up.\nMOUSE: I'm just trying to explain to Mr Halliday, Ellis, that...\nELLIS: I said shut up. What the hell are you doin’ here, Halliday?\nHALLIDAY: Not ... quite what you were expecting, eh Ellis? Hands against the wall.\nMOUSE: Oh, do as he says.\nHALLIDAY: Ellis?\nMOUSE: When are you...?\nMOUSE: Oh no, Ellis. Put that thing away.\nHALLIDAY: Do I have to get nasty, Mr Ellis? Come out here where I can see you and get your damned hands up against that wall.\nMOUSE: Ellis, for Christ sakes!\nHALLIDAY: You wanna play hardball, wise guy, huh? This pistol belonged to my Dad. He never missed.\nHALLIDAY: And neither do I.\nELLIS: Yeah? Yeah? And this ain't no Hallowe'en pop gun.\nMOUSE: Oh, Jesus, Ellis.\nELLIS: Move.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Which is where you came in.\nTHE DOCTOR: In the nick of time, or thereabouts.\nTHE DOCTOR: Put things back in their proper place. The King had to go through it all again, and this time...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: ...The tide came in. (Laughs.) What a silly...\nTHE DOCTOR: Canute? I'll say. Charley!\nDRIVER: You lousy jaywalking citizen!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Singapore, Nineteen Thirty?\nTHE DOCTOR: Perhaps, let me see. Thirty Fourth Street and Broadway. Ah.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Not Singapore.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, judging by that skyline and that taxi-driver's language...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: And that ... dead man.\nTHE DOCTOR: And that dead man ... Oh. I'd have to say New York City.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey Farmlands tonight, are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Huh?\nORSON WELLES: Who wrote this crap? I certainly didn't write this crap.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: You will, Orson, you will.\nORSON WELLES: The vanguard of an invading army - hogwash. We'd be better off pulling the whole thing, Jack.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: What would you prefer, dear boy - Lorna Doone?\nORSON WELLES: Well, why not? I can think of nothing more suitable for Hallowe'en except perhaps for - Little Lord Fauntleroy, now there's a thought.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Really Orson, now is not the time. Let's just get Howard's little play over and done and then we can concentrate on the important stuff.\nORSON WELLES: Danton's death.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: As you say, dear boy.\nORSON WELLES: Mm.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Anyway, I like the news report idea, I think it's rather neat.\nORSON WELLES: That's because you thought of it. Who'll be listening to us in any case? That damn ventriloquist is on.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: I know.\nORSON WELLES: Why do we bother?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Because Campbell's Soup pay us to. Now, you must think of yourself like Mr Bergen's little wooden friend, and get back in your box, Orson. I'm not letting you out of this studio until rehearsals are over.\nORSON WELLES: This is Orson Welles, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that The War of the Worlds has no further significance than as the holiday offering it was intended to be. The Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and...\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) ... jumping out of a bush and saying \"boo\".\nBIX BIRO: God...\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) Starting now we couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates...\nCARLA: What? Is that you?\nBIX BIRO: What are you trying to do?\nCARLA: Heavens, I'm sorry, Mr Biro, I saw the light, I figured someone must have forgot to lock the studio up.\nBIX BIRO: Yeah - No, no - no, Carla. I'm just fixing some equipment, for Mr Welles.\nCARLA: Just like the old times, eh sir?\nBIX BIRO: (laugh) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nCARLA: They still in there, sir? Them and the Martians? (laugh.)\nBIX BIRO: What? Oh. Oh, yeah.\nCARLA: (laugh) I don't know what they make all the fuss about. I mean, I see little green men all the time. All it takes is just a few hours with my old friend Jack Daniels. Not that I would, I wouldn't...\nBIX BIRO: That's okay, Carla. I'll see you in the morning.\nCARLA: Yeah, goodnight, Mr Biro, sorry. Sorry I startled you.\nBIX BIRO: Come on, come on!\nTHE DOCTOR: Anything?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Erm ... a wallet, a gun, some loose change, keys...\nTHE DOCTOR: Can I see the wallet? Hmm, JC Halliday, some sort of private detective.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What is it?\nTHE DOCTOR: I believe it's usual in these circumstances to find a clue written on the back of a book of matches.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Mm ... Mm, what, like this book of matches?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well done. What's in it?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Matches.\nTHE DOCTOR: Uh, that's the trouble with clich@s.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Shall we tell the police or something, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Probably not. I always seem to end up helping them with their enquiries. Perhaps it'd be better to go by Mr Halliday's office, and...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (alerted) Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh, nothing. I thought I saw someone. Over there by that shop.\nTHE DOCTOR: Mm, no-one there now. How's your stomach?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Pardon?\nTHE DOCTOR: Look at his body.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh! Burnt?\nTHE DOCTOR: Frazzled, more like.\nDON CHANEY: And then the boss looks at the fat guy and he says, \"How'd you get like that, Herman? You used to be such a skinny thing,” and the guy says, \"Time is cruel, Don.\"\nELLIS: And what did you say, boss?\nDON CHANEY: \"Ice cream is crueller.\"\nELLIS: \"Ice cream is crueller.\" Jeez, that was funny, boss. ‘Cause, you know, it was the ice\nELLIS: cream that must've made him fat, that - that's what the boss was sayin’...\nDON CHANEY: Yeah, I think the boys are capable of understanding that, Ellis.\nELLIS: Er - yeah, boss, sure, boss, er ... Hey, do you want some more meatballs?\nDON CHANEY: No.\nELLIS: Mind if I, er...?\nDON CHANEY: Go ahead.\nDON CHANEY: Say, where'd you get to before, Ellis?\nELLIS: Oh ... just some business, boss.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah. Ain't someone missin’?\nELLIS: Er ... yeah. Yeah, that little guy...\nDON CHANEY: Mouse.\nELLIS: Yeah.\nDON CHANEY: When I say I'm taking the boys out for dinner, I expect a full turnout, Ellis. You make sure of that.\nDON CHANEY: Can I help you, gentlemen?\nGANGSTER: 1: I guess so, Chaney. We've, er ... we've got a surprise for yous.\nDON CHANEY: A surprise? I like surprises.\nGANGSTER: 2: Yeah. Yous got a secret benefactor. He says, \"Hey guys, give this to The Phantom.\"\nDON CHANEY: What did you call me?\nGANGSTER: 1: \"I says, I don't know who you mean, sir.\" He says, \"Well, go along to Luigi's on Thirty-Fourth and Lexington, and look for the guy with his nose shot off.\"\nDON CHANEY: Why, you...\nGANGSTER: 2: And then he says...\nGANGSTER: 2: \"... Shoot off the rest of his face for me, will you?\"\nDON CHANEY: I wouldn't do that if I were you, boys.\nGANGSTER: 1: Oh no?\nGANGSTER: 2: Oh crap.\nDON CHANEY: Luigi? Could we have the tab, please?\nLUIGI: Si, Signor Chaney.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: So, it's not far off my time, Nineteen Thirty-Eight. I could get a boat home.\nTHE DOCTOR: You know, it's a constant puzzle to me why so many of my travelling companions can't wait to leave me. I show them all the wonders of the Universe, and what thanks do I get. Ah!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Halliday's office.\nTHE DOCTOR: Mm, at least according to his wallet, yes. Look - JC Halliday, Private Investigator, discretion assured.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What now?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, people are rarely killed without a reason, Charley, even in New York. Besides, there's the way he died. Concentrated radiation burst.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Is that what it was?\nTHE DOCTOR: Indubitably.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Onwards and upwards, then.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hmm?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: After you.\nGLORY BEE: Mr Halliday?\nTHE DOCTOR: Pardon? Oh, erm - erm, yes, yes, that's me.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor!\nGLORY BEE: Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Doctor ... er, Jack Halliday, private investigator.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Indiscretion assured.\nTHE DOCTOR: I never advertise the title. People badger you to look at their tonsils. Can I help?\nGLORY BEE: With my tonsils?\nTHE DOCTOR: No, I imagine you want to hire me.\nGLORY BEE: You came recommended. Shall we go up?\nTHE DOCTOR: Why not?\nTHE DOCTOR: Er - Charley, do you have, er ... my keys?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What? Oh, er, yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: My associate Miss Pollard. You are...?\nGLORY BEE: My name is Glory Bee. I need your help, Mr Halliday, desperately.\nTHE DOCTOR: I see. Well, erm, go on up, Miss Bee. It - it's the, er, the second floor.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor, what do you think you're doing?\nTHE DOCTOR: You know, I'm not at all sure. Let's see what happens, eh?\nMRS VAN BUREN: No. As far as I'm concerned it's just a feeble attempt to recapture her youth.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Really?\nMRS VAN BUREN: Yeah.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I'm always trying to recapture my youth, but he keeps escaping.\nMRS VAN BUREN: Oh, Cosmo! (Laughs.) Oh, you are a card.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Queen of Hearts.\nMAN: (amplified) Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. The founder of our feast.\nMRS VAN BUREN: I think you're wanted, Cosmo.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Uh-huh - in forty-nine states.\nMAN: (amplified) Mr Cosmo Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh well, here goes.\nCOSMO DEVINE: (amplified) Good evening, friends. And how delightful it is to see you all here. You know, as I was saying to the President the other day.\nCOSMO DEVINE: (amplified) \"Why, President,\" I said. \"What do you think of the new outfit?\" Oh, I forgot to mention I dropped by the White House in this gorgeous lilac suit I had a little man run up for me. Later on he ran down it again, but ...\nCOSMO DEVINE: (amplified) I said, \"Franklin, what do you think?\" Well, he looked me up and down kind of sneery, I have to say and murmurs, \"You forgot the pearls, Cosmo.\" I said \"Pearls? With lilac? Are you insane?\"\nCOSMO DEVINE: (amplified) Well, I hope you've all got your cheque books ready. My theatre project is the most deserving cause I know.\nCOSMO DEVINE: And I want to hear those cash registers ringing tonight. Oh, and don't forget - we have a special guest arriving later. None other than America's favourite Renaissance man himself, Mr Orson Welles.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Professor Pearson. Could this occurrence possibly have something to do with the disturbances observed on the planet Mars?\nORSON WELLES: Hardly, Mr Philips. This is probably a meteorite of unusual size and it's arrival at this particular time is merely a coincidence. However we shall conduct a search as soon as daylight permits. Blah, blah, blah...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Shall we call it a day?\nORSON WELLES: Oh yes please, let's call it a day.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: All right everyone, rehearsal over. You all have your call times, I trust?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Coulouris, what are you doing with those keys? See you tomorrow.\nORSON WELLES: Watch out for the Martians.\nORSON WELLES: I'm sure there was one driving my cab last night. He could have been Czech, though, it's so difficult to tell them apart.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Well, considering what's brewing back home I bet he'd take alien invasion over Mr Hitler any day. Do you want a drink?\nORSON WELLES: Naturally.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Oh - dammit, we're late for Cosmo Devine's little party.\nORSON WELLES: Oh, to hell with that, I've got a table booked at the Excelsior.\nBIX BIRO: Good evening Mr Houseman, Mr Welles.\nORSON WELLES: Hello, Bix. To what do we owe this honour?\nBIX BIRO: Honour?\nORSON WELLES: Well, we don't get the chairman of the network visiting our little studios\nORSON WELLES: every day, do we Jack?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Sadly no. Nice to see you, Mr Biro.\nBIX BIRO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever masterpiece has the Mercury Theatre of the Air to give us next?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: War Of The Worlds, sir. A Hallowe'en treat.\nORSON WELLES: Or a Hallowe'en trick - depends on how you look at it.\nBIX BIRO: The War Of The Worlds?\nORSON WELLES: You don't know it? It's Wells.\nBIX BIRO: (laugh) You wrote it?\nORSON WELLES: Alas I cannot claim the honour, sir. Herbert George Wells, Mr Biro, of the noted scientific romances. You may have heard of him?\nBIX BIRO: Yeah well, let's hope the public have, Mr Orson Welles, or the Columbia Broadcasting Service may have to think twice about renewing your contract. Good night to you.\nORSON WELLES: Philistine! Why we had to get ourselves in hock with a ... mob stooge like Biro...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: He has a point, my boy. We have to get ourselves noticed, and soon.\nMRS VAN BUREN: Oh, a hell of a speech, Cosmo. Oh! My Lord, you should stand for Congress, sweetie.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Thank you, no, Mrs van Buren. I get all the scandal and vice I need in the theatre.\nMRS VAN BUREN: (laughs.) Oh, Cosmo!\nCOSMO DEVINE: If you will excuse me, I have a call to make.\nTHE DOCTOR: Sit down, Miss Bee.\nTHE DOCTOR: Charley, get the lady a chair.\nGLORY BEE: Thank you. I prefer to stand.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, you don't mind if I...?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: That's a dead man's desk you've got your feet on, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: So Miss Bee, what's the rumpus? You cracking foxy with me or is you in trouble with the Bricks? They gonna drag you down to the hole because some guy gets shot through the pump with a heater?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Are you all right?\nTHE DOCTOR: Local patter, Charley, it always helps break the ice. As it happens, it's a particular skill of mine.\nGLORY BEE: Miss Pollard, is Mr Halliday unwell?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: No, no, erm ... he just gets like that sometimes. I believe he was trying to say, how can we help you?\nBIX BIRO: Come on, you son of a...\nBIX BIRO: Hello? Yeah, yeah ... yeah, yes. I think I have the information you require. I'll transmit the signal as arranged ... Mm? Yeah, yeah, tomorrow. Yes. (Louder) Look, I know what I'm doing, dammit! (Calmer) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, look - Look, can I just speak to him, please? ... I done everything you asked. Please, just let him go!\nBIX BIRO: Hello?\nBIX BIRO: Hello? Look, let him go will you? Please!\nBIX BIRO: God!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Your boyfriend is certainly very worried about you, Mr Winkler. I must say, I'd be very flattered to find anyone so concerned for my welfare. Sadly this is not likely. It's oh-so-difficult to form close personal relationships in my line of work.\nCOSMO DEVINE: However, if Mr Biro does as he is told, there should be no reason for any ... unpleasantness.\nCOSMO DEVINE: You can go back to your little job at the CBS and everything will be hunky-dory. Let's hope for your sake that Mr Biro plays ball.\nGLORY BEE: It's my Uncle, Mr Halliday. He was here in the city for some kind of conference. We'd arranged to meet, but he didn't show.\nTHE DOCTOR: Did you check his hotel?\nGLORY BEE: First place I went. They had no record of him.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Are you sure it was the right one?\nGLORY BEE: Perfectly - you see, I'd seen him there the afternoon before.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: In his room?\nGLORY BEE: No, the lobby.\nTHE DOCTOR: What did you do next?\nGLORY BEE: I went to the address he'd given for the conference.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Same result?\nGLORY BEE: It was just a warehouse down by the East River.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor, can I have a word?\nTHE DOCTOR: Er, just one moment, Miss Bee.\nTHE DOCTOR: What's the rumpus - I mean, what is it?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Should we be doing this? This poor woman's problem is nothing to do with us. She came here to find Halliday so he could find her Uncle.\nTHE DOCTOR: Halliday's dead.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Exactly. And you're not going to be of much use to Miss Glory Bee by\nCHARLEY POLLARD: indulging your private detective fantasies.\nTHE DOCTOR: No, I suppose you're right. Better refer to the police, or ... Miss Bee, this conference your Uncle was attending - what did you say it was?\nGLORY BEE: Heavy water, or something. I really don't understand what his research is.\nTHE DOCTOR: He's a scientist?\nGLORY BEE: Didn't I say?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: No. Heavy water? What's his field?\nGLORY BEE: Oh, I don't know. Something about atoms or some such...\nTHE DOCTOR: Atoms?\nGLORY BEE: Yeah.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor, why are you looking like that?\nTHE DOCTOR: Remember how Halliday died, Charley?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Radiation burst, you said.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hmm, I think Miss Bee's little problem may be more important than we thought.\nDON CHANEY: Ellis, open the chute.\nELLIS: Oh Jesus, boss. Would you look at that thing. I never seen the likes, It's...\nDON CHANEY: It's a Golden Goose, Ellis, that's what it is.\nDON CHANEY: And look at the pretty little eggs it keeps layin’.\nELLIS: Yeah. (Laughs.)\nDON CHANEY: And don't point that thing at me!\nDON CHANEY: Where the hell is that little rat anyway?\nELLIS: Er, the ... the boys is bringing him in right now.\nDON CHANEY: Ah.\nMOUSE: Mr Chaney ... Mr Chaney sir, there's been a misunderstanding. I...\nELLIS: Shut up. Shut up, you lousy fake.\nDON CHANEY: Now, where's your partner?\nMOUSE: I don't know what you mean, sir.\nDON CHANEY: I know someone's been fleecing me. I Know you're part of the scam, but I don't know who's behind it. Now, talk.\nMOUSE: I swear I don't know, Mr Chaney. I was told to bring some of the merchandise to the store. It all went crazy. And then ... then your guys found me.\nDON CHANEY: What the hell were you up to?\nMOUSE: Oh - you can vouch for me, ca... can't you, Mr Ellis?\nELLIS: Shut your mouth! He ... he's crazy, boss.\nMOUSE: I just borrowed the merchandise.\nDON CHANEY: What, this merchandise?\nMOUSE: Not that one, sir, but it was like it.\nDON CHANEY: How does it work, Ellis? Do you know? I mean ... I mean, if I pointed it at Mr Mouse here...\nMOUSE: No ... No!\nDON CHANEY: Yeah, you're right, you're right, I ain't through.\nDON CHANEY: So, your mysterious friend. He'd arranged to meet somebody?\nMOUSE: Yeah, that's right.\nELLIS: He - he - he was gonna sell the boss's merchandise?\nMOUSE: I - I guess so. I - I didn't know a thing. I - I swear it.\nDON CHANEY: Okay, okay. But the guy who turned up - that wasn't who your friend expected, am I right?\nMOUSE: Nah. It was Halliday. The private dick? We've had some run-ins with him before, when he was on the force. But somebody gave him what he wanted. Fried him. It w... it wasn't me, Mr Chaney...\nDON CHANEY: That's okay, son. What do we care if an ex-cop gets his guts fried, huh? Huh?\nDON CHANEY: And you have no idea who this benefactor of yours is?\nMOUSE: No, sir. I would tell you if I knew, I swear I would.\nDON CHANEY: I believe you, kid. Yeah, it's a damn shame.\nMOUSE: S-sir?\nDON CHANEY: Well - if I thought you'd be any use to us, I'd keep you alive.\nMOUSE: What? Oh - no - no, Mr Chaney, sir - I can help. I'll tell ya...\nELLIS: Shut up!\nDON CHANEY: You handled some of the merchandise, Mr Mickey Mouse, strictly against instructions. Now, I think it's time you saw some more of it. A little closer to. Ellis, take the gentleman's coat, would ya?\nELLIS: Why, it'd be a pleasure, boss.\nDON CHANEY: Open the chute, Ellis.\nMOUSE: No, no! Ph-phantom, please...\nDON CHANEY: Don't call me that!\nMOUSE: Mr Chaney. It - it was...\nELLIS: Go on, wise guy, there's...\nELLIS: ... some thing we'd like you to meet.\nMOUSE: No... No...\nMOUSE: No! Ellis!\nELLIS: Bon voy-agee!\nMOUSE: No!\nDON CHANEY: I think our friend was hungry tonight."

I'll tell ya...\nELLIS: Shut up!\nDON CHANEY: You handled some of the merchandise, Mr Mickey Mouse, strictly against instructions. Now, I think it's time you saw some more of it. A little closer to. Ellis, take the gentleman's coat, would ya?\nELLIS: Why, it'd be a pleasure, boss.\nDON CHANEY: Open the chute, Ellis.\nMOUSE: No, no! Ph-phantom, please...\nDON CHANEY: Don't call me that!\nMOUSE: Mr Chaney. It - it was...\nELLIS: Go on, wise guy, there's...\nELLIS: ... some thing we'd like you to meet.\nMOUSE: No... No...\nMOUSE: No! Ellis!\nELLIS: Bon voy-agee!\nMOUSE: No!\nDON CHANEY: I think our friend was hungry tonight.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Good morning.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What time is it?\nTHE DOCTOR: No idea. Look at this.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Where's...?\nTHE DOCTOR: She had to go. I've arranged another meeting.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh Doctor, it's six AM. Don't you ever sleep?\nTHE DOCTOR: Once in a while. Look.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Wh... what are they?\nTHE DOCTOR: Halliday's notes. He was onto something.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: The Excelsior? That's the hotel where Glory's uncle...\nTHE DOCTOR: Was staying, yes, or not staying according to the management. Halliday'd been down there to check things out, and...\nCOP: (from outside) Police! Open up!\nTHE DOCTOR: Police?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh Lor’! Halliday's body. It must have been found by now.\nTHE DOCTOR: I forgot about that. We'd better scarper.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: How?\nTHE DOCTOR: Down there.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Are you mad?\nTHE DOCTOR: It's only two floors.\nCOP: (from outside) This is the police. Open this door.\nTHE DOCTOR: The fire escape. There. I've made it easy.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: After you?\nTHE DOCTOR: Very well.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Right. The Excelsior Hotel?\nTHE DOCTOR: Indeed. The trouble is there's no address in Halliday's papers.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: We could ask a policeman.\nTHE DOCTOR: We'll find it. Come on.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor, hang on.\nGANGSTER: Okay Lady, the party's over.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What? Who...?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (CHARLEY POLLARD mumbles as though her mouth is covered and is being dragged away.)\nTHE DOCTOR: One thing about New York, Charley - the traffic is always terrible. Charley. Charley? Charley!\nBIX BIRO: Uh-huh. No, that's not a problem, look I understand. Your men didn't manage to, uh...\nBIX BIRO: Er ... clean up the restaurant as I hoped. Mm. Yeah.\nCARLA: Your coffee, Mr Biro.\nBIX BIRO: Yeah - yeah, thank you, Carla. (Laugh.) Very well, thank you again for your\nBIX BIRO: endeavours. Good morning.\nBIX BIRO: How are you finding the new recording machine, Carla?\nCARLA: Oh swell, Mr Biro.\nBIX BIRO: Okay.\nBIX BIRO: (tape) Memo, to the shareholders of the Columbia Broadcasting Service. October Thirty-First, Nineteen Thirty-Eight.\nBIX BIRO: Hmph. Never could stand the sound of my own voice.\nCARLA: Is everything all right, Mr Biro?\nBIX BIRO: What? Oh yeah, sure, Carla. Just a little business trouble. I tried to have some assets ... liquidated.\nTHE DOCTOR: Charley, where the devil are...?\nGLORY BEE: Trouble, Doc?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, it's you, Miss Bee.\nGLORY BEE: Where's your pal?\nTHE DOCTOR: That's what I'm trying to ascertain. We left the office, I was walking a little ahead and then...\nGLORY BEE: Well, it's a big city, gumshoe. There's a lot to tempt a girl.\nTHE DOCTOR: What are you suggesting? No, no, something smells rotten here.\nGLORY BEE: You're standing on a sewer. Listen, ten to one whoever's got my uncle has got your Miss Pollard.\nTHE DOCTOR: Perhaps.\nGLORY BEE: Well, no sense hanging around on the street. What say we get on with the investigation? That is why I hired you.\nTHE DOCTOR: No, no, I must find Charley, I mean, I - I'm not actually Halli...\nGLORY BEE: Not actually what?\nTHE DOCTOR: Nothing. Oh, very well, Miss Bee, the Excelsior Hotel it is, but keep your eyes peeled for Charley.\nORSON WELLES: Jack, what the hell are we doing here? We're late for rehearsals.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: You're late for rehearsals, Orson, and the reason we're here is because I couldn't let you go home last night in the state you were in, Virginia would...\nORSON WELLES: That was the State I was in?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Virginia would have killed me. You remember your wife, Orson?\nORSON WELLES: Vaguely.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Dear boy, come along.\nELLIS: This is crazy. Why can't we meet somewhere quiet?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Crowds make me feel secure. It's when I'm alone I get nervous.\nELLIS: You're a strange guy.\nCOSMO DEVINE: You'd better believe it. Okay, so - what happened last night? My man\nCOSMO DEVINE: came as arranged, but no you. Just some stiff on the street corner.\nELLIS: Yeah. Guy called Halliday, he was on to us somehow. Arrived early. I thought he was your guy for a while, and when I found it wasn't - bam!\nCOSMO DEVINE: You used...?\nELLIS: Oh yeah. Let me tell you, that baby's worth every cent, Mr Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Keep your voice down, you klutz. I'm not wearing these dark glasses just to protect my baby blues, you know. So this guy Halliday. He was on to us, you say?\nELLIS: I don't know how. Anyway, I had his place watched and one of my guys has taken a young lady into ... protective custody. She's back at your place.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Mm. Well, we can chat about that later. Now, I don't suppose you've thought any more about our conversation of the other night?\nELLIS: Mm?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Where's the merchandise coming from, Ellis?\nELLIS: Oh, you ... you know I can't tell you that.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I can make it worth your while.\nTHE DOCTOR: Stepashin. Professor Yuri Stepashin. He was staying here.\nMAN: No sir, I don't believe so.\nGLORY BEE: Check again, would you?\nMAN: I'm afraid there wouldn't be any point, Ma'am. No-one of that name has registered in this hotel.\nELLIS: What's up?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Stepashin. He's an atomic scientist over from Russia for a top-secret conference. I had my eye on him. He was here at the Excelsior, then ... puff, he vanished.\nELLIS: Why were you so interested in him?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh, he's a remarkable fella. A great brain, also he has theories about life on other worlds and has made no secret of them. We thought him just the man to ... help us with this little matter.\nELLIS: But someone else beat you to it.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Alas.\nELLIS: Yeah. And I know who.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Will you let me out! What on earth is ... Let me out!\nWINKLER: It's no good shouting. They're paid not to hear.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh! You made me jump. How long have you been here?\nWINKLER: Oh, about three weeks, I guess. I'm Jimmy. Hi.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Charley. Where are we?\nWINKLER: Somewhere in New Jersey, I think. What did you do to offend Mr Devine?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Who?\nWINKLER: Our host. Don't you know? That's the genius of it, I guess. No-one would ever think ill of Mr Cosmo Devine, the life and soul of every party.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: I've never heard of him. I was conducting an ... investigation with my friend.\nWINKLER: You will hear of Mr Devine, at least if he gets his way. I ... think he's planning a trip for some foreign visitors. They have trouble getting into the States via the usual\nWINKLER: channels.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Why? Who are they?\nWINKLER: The German Army.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? Could I speak to the manager, please?\nGLORY BEE: This isn't getting us very far. So, we think someone's got your friend and my uncle, the hotel's denying all knowledge of it.\nTHE DOCTOR: That about sums it up.\nGLORY BEE: Which I told you yesterday. Great start.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes well, could you cause a distraction? I've got an idea.\nGLORY BEE: A distraction? What kind of distraction?\nTHE DOCTOR: Search me. Engage the man at the desk in conversation, you know - politics, weather, approaching war, that kind of stuff.\nGLORY BEE: Approaching war?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, failing that, feign death. It always works for me.\nGLORY BEE: Help me.\nTHE DOCTOR: Miss Bee, what's wrong?\nGLORY BEE: Oh Mr Halliday, I feel strange, I...\nTHE DOCTOR: Help, please. Someone get a doctor.\nMAN: Oh my.\nGLORY BEE: Now what?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'll get the guest register while no-one's looking.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. Don't you people know the meaning of service? Get this young lady a chair.\nGLORY BEE: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Are you sure, Miss? That was quite a tumble.\nGLORY BEE: No, no. No,. that's ... that's all right.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, you do look a lot better actually. Shall we go?\nGLORY BEE: You found it?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'll tell you later. She's going again.\nTHE DOCTOR: Come on, I'd better get you to a darkened room.\nGLORY BEE: I beg your pardon?\nTHE DOCTOR: Fifteenth floor. Room One Five Four Oh.\nSTEPASHIN: Careful, careful. This is the crucial stage, my friend. Now, if I add just one tiny drop to the suspension.\nELLIS: The top of the morning to you, Professor.\nELLIS: Oh Jeez, I'm sorry.\nSTEPASHIN: Look what you have made me do, you cretinous dog!\nELLIS: Hey, no need to get nasty, Prof.\nSTEPASHIN: Look, I go along with your little scheme, yes? I try to find out how our visitor in the tank ticks, yes? And all I ask in your return is that your ugly mindless brutes don't come crashing in here like the Keystone Kops.\nELLIS: Don't call the boss ugly.\nDON CHANEY: Shut up.\nELLIS: No. I got to put him right, boss. I know how sensitive you is about your mug an’ all.\nDON CHANEY: Shut up!\nELLIS: You know, when that guy in Luigi's called you the Phantom I got so mad, I tell ya...\nDON CHANEY: Ellis! If you don't want to join our friend in there...\nDON CHANEY: ... You'll keep it zipped, capiche? Professor, I apologise for my loutish associate. So tell me. How goes it?\nSTEPASHIN: I progress. That is all I can say. There is so much information, such wonders. Ach, it would take a thousand lifetimes to decode it all.\nDON CHANEY: Ah, you've got three days.\nSTEPASHIN: This I know,\nELLIS: The boss is close to a deal, ain't ya, boss?\nDON CHANEY: That's right, Ellis. Then the guns, the flying saucer, and the whatever the hell itis in there, goes west.\nSTEPASHIN: To the highest bidder?\nDON CHANEY: Naturally. I ain't running no charity.\nSTEPASHIN: But you don't understand, Mr Chaney.\nDON CHANEY: Don. Call me Don.\nSTEPASHIN: Yes - Don. If this technology falls into the wrong hands...\nDON CHANEY: What? There'll be a war? There's already one cooking up nicely out there Professor, or ain't you heard?\nSTEPASHIN: If the Nazis were to hear of this...\nDON CHANEY: They won't. They ain't even in the bidding. Don't you fret now, Professor. The CIA ain't stupid. They'll come round to my way of thinking and pay my price. And then this particular Man in the Moon will make sure Uncle Sam's on the winning side, huh? Huh?\nTHE DOCTOR: The page for October Thirtieth had been removed, then copied out again.\nGLORY BEE: So how come you spotted my uncle?\nTHE DOCTOR: I could see where the names had left their imprint on the next page. Is this the right floor? Yes. They were all the same, all the signatures carefully traced over.\nGLORY BEE: Except One Five Four Oh. Here it is.\nTHE DOCTOR: Where, according to the register, A Mr Schwerwasser resides.\nGLORY BEE: What kind of a name is that?\nTHE DOCTOR: No kind. It's a joke, not a very good one at that. It's the German for heavy water, as used in the production of...\nGLORY BEE: Atomic weapons.\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: Mr Schwerwasser? Mr Schwerwasser, Room Service.\nGLORY BEE: What are you expecting to find, Doc? I mean, if he'd been kidnapped they're hardly likely to keep him in his own hotel room.\nTHE DOCTOR: Clues, Miss Bee. Anything which might tell us where he's being held.\nGLORY BEE: How did you...?\nTHE DOCTOR: Please.\nGANGSTER: Glad youse could join us. The boss would like a word. I understand you's been asking questions.\nORSON WELLES: What are we doing tied to this lumbering monstrosity? There's serious work down there, Jack. That's what the Mercury Theatre should be doing, not these penny-dreadfuls.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Oh, a dollar fifty dreadfuls at least, Orson. Besides, that's a bit rich coming from The Shadow.\nORSON WELLES: Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of Man? The Shadow knows.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Pure melodrama, my boy. As I say, the pot calling the kettle black.\nORSON WELLES: Beige, perhaps, Jack. What time are we on?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Five minutes. Now, get this down you and for Pete's sake relax.\nORSON WELLES: We know now that in the early years of the Twentieth Century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than Man's, and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the Earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood, which by chance or design Man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space ... Hmm. Not bad, Howard, not bad.\nCARLA: Two minutes, studio.\nEDGAR BERGAN: (radio) Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're very glad to be here.\nCHARLIE: McCARTHY: (radio) Speak for yourself.\nDON CHANEY: How do they think of these things? I love it, I love it!\nGANGSTER: Kinda strange though, eh boss?\nDON CHANEY: What is?\nGANGSTER: Well, a dummy on the radio. I mean, how do we know the guy's lips ain't moving?\nDON CHANEY: Shut your mouth. You want to spoil the magic, huh?\nGANGSTER: No, boss. Sorry.\nCHARLIE: McCARTHY: (radio) A match made in heaven.\nEDGAR BERGAN: (radio) You'll be taking a trip to the...\nDON CHANEY: I can't listen to it now. Twist the god-damned dial.\nGANGSTER: Yes, sir.\nMALE RADIO VOICE: The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations present Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre of the Air in \"The War Of The Worlds\" by H.G. Wells.\nDON CHANEY: Where the hell is Ellis’? He's never around when I need him.\nGANGSTER: He went to put the two I found sniffing around at The Excelsior into the clink. In case you want to give them the once-over.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah, I might just do that.\nORSON WELLES: (radio) We know now that in the early years of the Twentieth Century...\nDON CHANEY: So you got the candy ready?\nGANGSTER: Candy, Mr Chaney?\nDON CHANEY: Yeah. In case some kids come round for Trick or Treat.\nGANGSTER: Trick or Treat. That's good, boss.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah. Yeah well, I think I will go and see those goons you picked up. I can't sit around on my brains all night.\nGANGSTER: Yes, sir.\nGANGSTER: Er - I mean no, sir.\nORSON WELLES: (radio) ... Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope...\nGANGSTER: Dumb freak.\nORSON WELLES: (radio) ... Might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the Earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood, which by chance or design Man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this Earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.\nELLIS: Mr Chaney's too busy to see youse now but he says he might drop by a little later.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's very nice of Mr Chaney. Could you remove the blindfolds now? We promise not to peep.\nELLIS: Well, er ... okay.\nTHE DOCTOR: Would it be too much to ask why you've brought us here?\nELLIS: That's secret. All I Know is I have to bring in anyone sniffing around the Professor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Remind me not to entrust you with any of my secrets.\nGLORY BEE: Professor Stepashin?\nELLIS: Er ... well, I'm not allowed to say.\nTHE DOCTOR: No, Miss Bee, it could be any of a number of kidnapped Professors, isn't that right, Mr...?\nELLIS: Ellis.\nTHE DOCTOR: Like the island.\nELLIS: Yeah, yeah. That's what they call me.\nTHE DOCTOR: I can't think why.\nELLIS: Yeah ... Hey, you talk too much.\nTHE DOCTOR: So I'm told. Well, don't let us keep you.\nELLIS: Er ... Hey, a word of advice. When you meet the boss, don't make no cracks about his mug. It upsets him. And when he gets upset he gets angry.\nTHE DOCTOR: Thank you very much, we'll bear that in mind. Toodle-oo.\nELLIS: Er ... right.\nGLORY BEE: You think these mobsters have my uncle?\nTHE DOCTOR: Seems likely, don't you think? At the very least they're involved, but the question is why?\nGLORY BEE: It's a wicked world, Doc. There's plenty of people who'd like to get their hands on what's inside my uncle's head.\nTHE DOCTOR: Mm. Well, no sense in hanging round here, we'll find out an awful lot more once we're mobile again. Besides, I've got to find Charley.\nGLORY BEE: Maybe they're holding her here too.\nTHE DOCTOR: I wouldn't mind having another look inside that hotel, though.\nGLORY BEE: You think she's there?\nTHE DOCTOR: Possibly. I'd also like to try one of their sidecars. I've a weakness for Manhattan cocktails.\nGLORY BEE: You're forgetting something.\nTHE DOCTOR: I am?\nGLORY BEE: The door.\nTHE DOCTOR: Please.\nGLORY BEE: We're you a housebreaker before you became a detective?\nTHE DOCTOR: No, but I've been intimately involved with more cell doors than you've had...\nGLORY BEE: Dead men?\nTHE DOCTOR: I was going to say hot dinners.\nGLORY BEE: I've had a few.\nTHE DOCTOR: And yet you stay so slim. What's your secret?\nGLORY BEE: Clean living. What's yours?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, every now and again I treat myself to a complete makeover.\nTHE DOCTOR: Let's go.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: And he's got some kind of hold over your ... your friend.\nWINKLER: Yeah. Bix has some ... unwholesome connections. Mobsters, mainly. I guess Devine thinks he can find out where this space stuff is being kept.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Good evening to you.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: What's going on here? I mean, honestly, can't a person walk down the street without being kidnapped these days?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Hush now.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Why are you keeping me here?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh! What the...\nWINKLER: Leave her alone!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Don't struggle.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh, I don't believe this. Will you let me go?\nCOSMO DEVINE: I'm afraid not. Not until you've answered fully one or two questions which I must put to you.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Who are you?\nCOSMO DEVINE: The Boogey-Man, sweetheart. Now, tell me about your interest in Professor Stepashin and a little matter of New York City's illustrious new visitors.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: I don't know what you're talking about.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh, come on. We are not children.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Sadly, it may prove necessary to inject a little ... something to speed the process along.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: No!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Will you hold out your arm, please? Or do I have to get nasty?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: No!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: \"PHILLIPS\": (radio) most terrifying thing I've ever witnessed.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh...\nCOSMO DEVINE: \"PHILLIPS\": (radio) Wait a minute...\nCOSMO DEVINE: I almost forgot.\nCOSMO DEVINE: \"PHILLIPS\": (radio) Someone's crawling out of the hollow top ... some one, or ... some thing...\nCOSMO DEVINE: Happy Hallowe'en.\nCOSMO DEVINE: \"PHILLIPS\": (radio) ... two luminous discs ... Are they eyes? It might be a face, it might be...\nTHE DOCTOR: Shine the light, would you?\nGLORY BEE: This looks promising.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, it's certainly the sort of place I'd knock up if I were in the Professor's line of work. Nice equipment.\nGLORY BEE: I bet you say that to all the girls.\nTHE DOCTOR: Actually, no. Look.\nGLORY BEE: What is it?\nTHE DOCTOR: Do you know what that is?\nGLORY BEE: Nota clue.\nTHE DOCTOR: Nor me.\nGLORY BEE: Oh.\nTHE DOCTOR: But this I do know and this is very familiar.\nGLORY BEE: I'm all ears.\nTHE DOCTOR: They're part of the drive system from a star ship.\nGLORY BEE: Star ship?\nTHE DOCTOR: Extraterrestrial, or I'm a Dutchman.\nGLORY BEE: Extra... You mean...?\nTHE DOCTOR: Not of this Earth, Miss Glory Bee. Quite a thought, isn't it?\nGLORY BEE: Someone's coming. Quickly.\nTHE DOCTOR: Lights!\nTHE DOCTOR: Behind this. Get your head down.\nGLORY BEE: Doctor...\nTHE DOCTOR: Shh!\nSTEPASHIN: Ah ... ah-hah ... Yes, yes, Mm, mm, yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: Is that your uncle?\nGLORY BEE: That's Professor Stepashin, yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, what are we waiting for?\nGLORY BEE: No, wait, wait.\nSTEPASHIN: And how is my patient?\nSTEPASHIN: It's getting murky in there, like a dirty goldfish bowl, eh my friend? I cannot see you in there, but ... you are getting well, yes?\nSTEPASHIN: I do not think I will be trying to take your temperature just yet.\nTHE DOCTOR: What's the matter? He's your Uncle, isn't he? This'll be a nice reunion.\nGLORY BEE: Let's wait, see if we can find out more about who kidnapped him.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, why don't we just ask him? Professor Stepashin?\nSTEPASHIN: What is this? Who...?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm sorry to startle you. I'm the Doctor, and I've brought a visitor. Glory?\nSTEPASHIN: What do you think you're ... Who are you people?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm just a tourist, but this lady needs no introduction, surely?\nSTEPASHIN: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: Your niece.\nSTEPASHIN: I have no family. Where is Chaney? What the hell is going on?\nGLORY BEE: Sorry, Doc. I guess I ought to thank you for leading me to the Professor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, not at all.\nSTEPASHIN: You have come for me?\nGLORY BEE: It's nothing personal. I'm doing it for Mother Russia."

Who are you people?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm just a tourist, but this lady needs no introduction, surely?\nSTEPASHIN: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: Your niece.\nSTEPASHIN: I have no family. Where is Chaney?

Two aliens, NORIAM's voice more high-pitched that STREATH.)\nSTREATH: Situation, Conserver Noriam?\nNORIAM: Decimation pattern concluded. And as estimated, Destroyer Streath, we are only a short distance from the stranded breeding party.\nSTREATH: That is acceptable.

However a brief techno-scan prior to landfall reveals evidence of a heavily-industrialised pre-fission civilisation.

This is the future that Mother Russia offers me.\nGLORY BEE: Come, we must get out of here. Walk, please.\nTHE DOCTOR: You were going to defect.\nSTEPASHIN: I do not know the term.\nGLORY BEE: We suspected the Professor was planning to ... extend his trip to the United States a little. It is important that such a mind as his remain within the Soviet Union.\nTHE DOCTOR: But you lost him, didn't you?\nGLORY BEE: Somebody made away with him, yes. We decided to try any means of discovering his whereabouts, even down to hiring disgusting Capitalist private detective! No offence, Mr Halliday.\nTHE DOCTOR: None taken, I'm not Halliday, he's dead.\nGLORY BEE: Then it seems we have both been playing games.\nTHE DOCTOR: Shh!\nSTEPASHIN: But you don't understand. Neither of you can. This is no longer about politics. What is in that room will change the world.\nTHE DOCTOR: Alien technology, I know.\nSTEPASHIN: Yes, and already I have used it to advance my studies in atomic fission. It will be of incredible benefit to Mankind.\nTHE DOCTOR: Or finish off Mankind altogether.\nSTEPASHIN: Not just the wonderful machines of these space creatures, one of the creatures themselves.\nTHE DOCTOR: What?\nSTEPASHIN: Back there, back there in the tank.\nGLORY BEE: This is all to the good. Now I shall return the Professor to Moscow, along with his astounding trinkets.\nTHE DOCTOR: I imagine they're pretty heavy. How do you propose...?\nGLORY BEE: Once we are out of here, I shall make contact with my people. They will arrive in force. Now, through here, if you please.\nSTEPASHIN: What is this?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, well. I've seen some secret headquarters in my time. A headquarters inside the Brooklyn Bridge.\nORSON WELLES: Suddenly my eyes were attracted to the immense flock of black birds that hovered directly below me. They circled to the ground and there before my eyes, stark and silent, lay the Martians. With the hungry birds pecking and tearing brown shreds of flesh from their dead bodies. Later when their bodies were examined in the laboratories, it was found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared...\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) Slain, after all Man's defences had failed...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: What's that, Carla?\nCARLA: I don't know, sir.\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) ...by the humblest thing that God in his wisdom put upon this Earth.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Very nice, Orson.\nCARLA: Yeah? ... What? What did you say? You're kidding. What!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Carla?\nCARLA: It's the switchboards, Mr Houseman. They're jammed.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: You mean somebody's listening?\nCARLA: You could put it that way, sir. They ... they think it's real.\nBIX BIRO: Oh boy! You've really done it this time!\nSTEPASHIN: Most ingenious.\nTHE DOCTOR: Ingenious indeed. Discreet, and yet handy for town.\nGLORY BEE: There is no time for this. The Professor and I must be going. To the victor, the spoils, eh? In this case, the Soviet Union. Doctor, you are free to go.\nTHE DOCTOR: That's very kind of you, but I'm afraid I'd rather stick around. As I've explained, I can't really allow that technology to fall into anyone's hands.\nDON CHANEY: Least of all a lousy Red.\nTHE DOCTOR: Now, let's not do anything hasty.\nDON CHANEY: You're the two Ellis found at the hotel?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes.\nDON CHANEY: The ones he told me were locked up?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes.\nDON CHANEY: Would you recommend I get myself a new second-in-command?\nTHE DOCTOR: Probably. Now listen, Mr ... Chaney, isn't it?\nDON CHANEY: That's right. So youse is the Russkies, huh?\nTHE DOCTOR: No, no, the lady is a ... is a Russkie, I'm just an interested observer.\nDON CHANEY: Observer, huh? Never sit on fences, my friend. It makes your eyes water.\nTHE DOCTOR: All right, Mr Chaney, I'm not an observer, I'm an active participant. Now, listen to me. We both know what kind of a precarious state the world is in currently.\nDON CHANEY: Uh-huh...\nTHE DOCTOR: Then I implore you, whatever deal you've made, forget it. This stuff is too dangerous to give to anyone right now.\nDON CHANEY: But I made a deal, Mr...\nTHE DOCTOR: Doctor.\nDON CHANEY: Doctor. Don Chaney made a deal with the good guys, how about that? The\nCIA: are on their way to a cosy rendezvous. I'm packing up my troubles and I'm gonna give them all that space junk downstairs.\nSTEPASHIN: At least he has not sold it to the Nazis.\nGLORY BEE: But it belongs to us. The Professor has sustained this creature, analysed the technology. I claim it all!\nDON CHANEY: Are you kiddin’?\nTHE DOCTOR: What do you think this is, Pass The Parcel? We're talking about technology that is thousands of years in advance of what you have on Earth. The Professor here has already adapted what he's learned to help with his fission experiments.\nSTEPASHIN: Yes. Yes, I have constructed a prototype. I believe it will work. Think of it. An atomic bomb.\nTHE DOCTOR: I am thinking of it. Now please, Mr Chaney, Professor, Miss Bee or whoever you are, let it go. Believe me, it's for the best. I can take care of this.\nDON CHANEY: And who are youse, huh? Santy Claus? Say, are you English? Is that why you're giving us all this hope and charity stuff? Yeah, that's it. Your Mr Chamberlain wants to get his paws on it first. Well, no dice, Doctor.\nGANGSTER: Boss! Boss!\nDON CHANEY: Hey, you're just in time. Tell Ellis he's fired.\nGANGSTER: Listen boss, it's on the radio. Everyone's talking about it.\nDON CHANEY: Talking about what?\nGANGSTER: Men from Space, boss. They're here.\nDON CHANEY: We know that, you klutz. What do you think this whole goddamn circus is about?\nGANGSTER: No, no, not that man from Space, boss. Some other man from Space.\nTHE DOCTOR: What?\nGANGSTER: Martians. The Martians have landed!\nTHE DOCTOR: I sincerely hope not.\nORSON WELLES: (radio) ... in vain for the monsters that inhabit those machines.\nELLIS: That was the signal?\nCOSMO DEVINE: That's correct, Mr Ellis. The signal telling me I can toddle along to the CBS and pick up the information I require.\nELLIS: Ah - ah ... I think she's coming out of it.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Really. It's of small consequence.\nELLIS: I-information? What information?\nWINKLER: The alien. Where it's being kept.\nELLIS: Why .,.. but how can you...\nELLIS: No. You need me, Devine. I got you all this merchandise.\nCOSMO DEVINE: And I'm probably grateful. Alas, you wouldn't divulge its location and so I had to find someone else who'd tell me.\nELLIS: You ... you double-crossed me.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Naturally. My grandmother taught me two things in life. Never wash taffeta with cotton, and never put all your eggs in one basket. I have to say, the latter has been of most use to me.\nELLIS: You know where the spaceman is.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I will very shortly. I've been keeping this young man in my house. \"Plus @a change...\", I hear you cry. But this one was staying very much against his will, I'm afraid. His nearest and dearest is very keen to get him back.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Blackmail.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Well, hello. Yes, blackmail. What do they say in the movies? It's an ugly word? Well, it's an ugly world too, my friend, as you will shortly find out.\nELLIS: You're crazy, Devine! What if your guy doesn't come up with the address? Then what? I'm your only hope.\nCOSMO DEVINE: It's a chance I'll take, if only to spare myself your dazzling conversation. Ta-ta.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: No!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Why, you...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Chair, quick!\nELLIS: What?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Hit him with the chair!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Now, cut Jimmy loose or I'll shoot.\nELLIS: It's no good. The ray gun must have got him. He's a goner.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh ... Oh, all right. Let's go. Move.\nTHE DOCTOR: We can't stand around here all night.\nDON CHANEY: I gotta protect my investment, Doctor. The CIA want the Professor here as well. Maybe they'll want you too. You science guys fetch quite a few cents, I can tell you. Now, drop the gun, sister.\nGLORY BEE: Hah! I am trained Soviet agent. I do not disarm myself because some stupid Yankee gangster threatens me.\nDON CHANEY: Uh. I'll count to three.\nSTEPASHIN: Please, stop this.\nDON CHANEY: Hand over the Prof and you can go home to Siberia and play with your dolls.\nGLORY BEE: You know, we have skilled surgeons in Soviet Union. They could do something about that face of yours.\nDON CHANEY: Uh, sticks and stones. Now, what's all this about Martians?\nTHE DOCTOR: I've no idea. I would imagine that whoever lost his alien ship has come back to find it and ... Wait a minute. What year is this?\nDON CHANEY: Oh, now I heard it all.\nTHE DOCTOR: Nineteen Thirty-Eight, yes?\nSTEPASHIN: October Thirty-First, why?\nTHE DOCTOR: Martians, hmm?\nBIX BIRO: They're going crazy, Houseman. What the hell did you think you were doing?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: We none of us expected this, Mr Biro.\nBIX BIRO: Yes? What? Oh, for Christ sakes.\nBIX BIRO: The whole place is under siege, you dumb ass! As if I didn't have enough on my ... Is that clock right?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Of course.\nBIX BIRO: Okay. You're off the air in five. Now, I'm expecting a ... very important visitor. I want you to get that young idiot in there to apologise to the people of America for scaring the bejesus out of 'em, and then, I want to see both of you in my office.\nBIX BIRO: Martians. Jesus!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: All right, Carla. Better write something appropriate for young Mr Welles. Lock that door, would you? I've a feeling it's ... gonna be a long night.\nWOMAN: The Martians are coming! The Martians are coming! They're coming!\nMAN: They're here already, lady. Jersey's been blowed.\nWOMAN: Oh my Lord.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh, keep moving, you fat fool.\nELLIS: I'm ... I'm gonna wring your neck, little lady.\nELLIS: What the...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Do you see what I see?\nELLIS: L-let's get out of here.\nSTREATH: What was that? Seize them.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh my God! Get off me, get away!\nELLIS: Holy Mother...\nSTREATH: Destroy, destroy, destroy!\nNORIAM: Wait, wait.\nSTREATH: You dare to question me?\nNORIAM: It is my right as a brother Laiderblacker to question you, Streath. I am merely suggesting that we record the life-form before its destruction.\nSTREATH: Destruction is good, Noriam. To destroy is the Second Principle.\nNORIAM: And the joint Second Principle is conservation. That is our way. Do I have to explain to you as I would to a child?\nSTREATH: Yes, yes! The middle way, I know. Between destruction and conservation lies wisdom, yes...\nNORIAM: Precisely. Now, would it not be wise to gauge the strength of the native creatures by examining them?\nSTREATH: There is some sense in your words, Noriam. Their destruction shall be postponed.\nNORIAM: Thank you.\nSTREATH: Postponed, mind you. Now...\nSTREATH: Ahh...!\nSTREATH: They're very little, are they not?\nNORIAM: Indeed, Streath. Keep still, beast!\nSTREATH: And ... and without much hair. It is a poor thing to be so hairless. What are you called, hairless thing? Ahh...!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Ch... Ch... Charley.\nSTREATH: Are you an overlord of this place, Ch-Ch-Charley, or an underling?\nSTREATH: Answer! Your destruction has merely been postponed.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: I don't understand.\nNORIAM: May I?\nNORIAM: Now, what is this place called?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: I haven't a clue.\nNORIAM: You, then. What is this place called?\nELLIS: N... New Jersey.\nNORIAM: And what are your defensive capabilities?\nELLIS: Eh?\nNORIAM: (Sigh.) Is N-New Jersey the place where your weapons are kept?\nELLIS: No, sir. I guess that'd be in ... in the city.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Shut up, Ellis.\nSTREATH: The city.\nELLIS: Manhattan. Just across the water.\nNORIAM: Water? Ah yes.\nELLIS: You, er ... need, erm ... the Staten Island ferry.\nSTREATH: Just so, Noriam?\nNORIAM: Yes.\nSTREATH: This city. This must be where the breeding party crashed. Tracking must begin at once, and prepare for takeoff.\nNORIAM: Very well.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Well done, Ellis.\nSTREATH: And you will come with us, hairless things. You may prove useful. We'll take Manhattan, and Staten Island too.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I had quite a bit of trouble getting in here, Mr Biro. Is there a Mardi Gras going on?\nBIX BIRO: Look, never mind that. Did anyone see you come in?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Nota soul. I followed your instructions to the letter. And I got your signal. Ingenious.\nBIX BIRO: Yeah, yeah, well ... I was a sound engineer before they put me behind this desk. It wasn't very difficult to arrange.\nCOSMO DEVINE: You have the location?\nBIX BIRO: I got it. Now, where's Jimmy ... Mr Winkler?\nCOSMO DEVINE: He's safe. He'll be released as soon as we leave here.\nBIX BIRO: How do I know...?\nCOSMO DEVINE: That he'll be all right? You don't. I guess you'll just have to trust me.\nBIX BIRO: Okay. Okay. The spaceship or whatever crash-landed in Brooklyn. The CIA were onto it like flies round a wound, but the local mobsters got there first, a fella called...\nCOSMO DEVINE: Chaney. Don Chaney. Known as The Phantom.\nBIX BIRO: You know all this?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Naturally. One of Mr Chaney's thugs was until recently in my employ. And I have a few scores still to settle with him. All I need is the address.\nBIX BIRO: (laugh) It's not quite an address. Chaney's base is inside the left leg of the Brooklyn Bridge. Manhattan side.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Thank you. I knew I could rely on those rather dubious underworld\nCOSMO DEVINE: contacts of yours. I'm sure no-one need hear of them now.\nBIX BIRO: Devine, you'll let Jimmy go?\nCOSMO DEVINE: I only wish I could, Mr Biro, but he met with an accident a short time ago.\nBIX BIRO: Why, you...\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh, there's just one more thing.\nCOSMO DEVINE: That's Mr Devine to you.\nDON CHANEY: Here. Take this. These rays guns is heavy.\nGANGSTER: Sure, boss.\nTHE DOCTOR: Look, over there, heading towards us.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah, yeah, I know all the tricks, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm serious...\nSTEPASHIN: My God!\nTHE DOCTOR: We've got company, Mr Chaney.\nDON CHANEY: What is it?\nTHE DOCTOR: A version of the ship I imagine you have in pieces down below. It's probably...\nGLORY BEE: Get back, all of you.\nGANGSTER: Lady?\nGLORY BEE: The Professor comes with me.\nGANGSTER: Let him go.\nDON CHANEY: Now, now - don't shoot.\nTHE DOCTOR: Hang on, take my hand.\nTHE DOCTOR: Take it.\nGLORY BEE: I can't ... I can't hold on.\nTHE DOCTOR: Chaney, help me.\nDON CHANEY: Okay, okay. Here lady, grab hold of my arm.\nGLORY BEE: No good...\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh no!\nDON CHANEY: Jeez. She was a looker too. Okay, you wise guys - downstairs.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, Miss Bee, I hope it was worth it, all for Mother Russia.\nNORIAM: Energy weapon fired outside at close quarters, Streath. I think we've found them.\nSTREATH: There is a body of water below, yes?\nNORIAM: According to our scans.\nSTREATH: Then put us down there.\nELLIS: That's the Brooklyn Bridge down there. I may still have a chance.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: A chance for what?\nELLIS: To make good. I gotta warn Chaney. Devine is after him. He'll be down here with his men as soon as he knows about the bridge. If I can warn Chaney...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Why are you so concerned about Chaney? You were selling him out, weren't you?\nELLIS: Ah, it was business, that's all, I ... I thought I was just using my initiative. I never told him where the boss has his headquarters.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Huh! Bully for you. I bet your precious Mr Chaney won't be in a forgiving mood.\nELLIS: I owe him everything. How can I sell him down the river to a goddamn Nazi.\nSTREATH: If the breeding party is intact, then how are we to proceed?\nNORIAM: As usual, of course, Streath. I'm afraid destruction may have to be indefinitely postponed.\nSTREATH: Oh, it's always the same.\nNORIAM: Keep your voice down, Streath. We must appear invincible to these creatures.\nDON CHANEY: Okay, get inside.\nDON CHANEY: Hell, where is everybody? Ellis? Ellis! You, go see what's up.\nGANGSTER: Yes, boss.\nSTEPASHIN: What about ... the Martians?\nTHE DOCTOR: They're not Martians. Oh, this is extraordinary.\nDON CHANEY: What is?\nTHE DOCTOR: I think I Know what's going on, and it's quite an amusing coincidence.\nDON CHANEY: Do you see me laughing?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Well, isn't this nice.\nDON CHANEY: What the hell...?\nCOSMO DEVINE: You must think me such a bore, Mr Chaney. It is Mr Chaney, isn't it? I arrive unannounced, gatecrash your little party and then spirit away your special guests.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Steady, boys.\nTHE DOCTOR: Who are you?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Cosmo Devine. Perhaps you've read my articles in the Tatler.\nDON CHANEY: Listen to me, you lousy faggot. I made a deal for all this space junk and I gave them my word. Don Chaney's word is his bond.\nCOSMO DEVINE: How touching. Well, well, time and tide, time and tide. My associates and I will have to be going. Soldier, get this machinery out of here, then kill them all.\nSOLDIER: Jawohl!\nSTEPASHIN: Soldier?\nTHE DOCTOR: I think Mr Devine's associates are representatives of an unfriendly power, Mr Chaney.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh, didn't I mention? How remiss. Yes, they're Germans. Pure, one\nCOSMO DEVINE: hundred per cent. Unlike me. I'm just what they call a sympathiser.\nDON CHANEY: Lousy Fifth Columnist.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Just a gossip columnist, actually. Incidentally, I've always wondered, what do the other four columns do?\nTHE DOCTOR: Devine, I implore you not to do this. If you give Nazi Germany this technology...\nSTEPASHIN: Da, da. This is what I have been saying.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Well, you'll forgive me for being obvious, but that is rather the point, isn't it? They'll be unbeatable. Flying disc ships, death rays. I think they'll have the opposition beat.\nTHE DOCTOR: I can't let you do it.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Well, boo-hoo. Just how are you going to stop me?\nSTEPASHIN: What are you doing? You mustn't unseal the tank.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I'm afraid my pals in Berlin aren't worried about the spacemen, Prof. They just want the guns.\nSTEPASHIN: But it is priceless, priceless!\nCOSMO DEVINE: My heart bleeds. Okay, junk it, soldier.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh dear.\nSTEPASHIN: I can't see anything. Do you think it is dead?\nTHE DOCTOR: No.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What are you waiting for, Fritzy? Christmas? Get the thing out of there and we'll split.\nSOLDIER: Es ist schrecklich!\nSOLDIER: [Translation - \"it is horrible.\"]\nCOSMO DEVINE: Hey-ho. If you want something doing. Here, give me that gun.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What in God's...?\nTHE DOCTOR: How many creatures did you say were in the tank, Professor?\nSTEPASHIN: One. One only.\nTHE DOCTOR: Look.\nSTEPASHIN: Oh no.\nTHE DOCTOR: I think something else has been doing the splitting, Mr Devine. Binary fission. It's been reproducing.\nSTEPASHIN: There are?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes. There must be thirty of them.\nTHE DOCTOR: End of part three on CD.\nSOLDIER: Oh my God!\nTHE DOCTOR: Right, everybody out.\nTHE DOCTOR: Chaney, through the door, come on.\nSTEPASHIN: Okay. I made mistake. Now...\nTHE DOCTOR: We can't just leave them in there.\nDON CHANEY: Watch me. Where's the Professor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Still inside, I'm afraid. You've got to get him out.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Your loyalty is touching, but a little misplaced. In case you haven't noticed, there's a bunch of giant fruitbats in there making short work of the Fuhrer's finest.\nTHE DOCTOR: We have to try.\nCOSMO DEVINE: You forget...\nCOSMO DEVINE: I still have this little baby.\nTHE DOCTOR: I'm going back for him.\nDON CHANEY: Watch it.\nTHE DOCTOR: Professor.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Are you crazy?\nSTEPASHIN: Leave me.\nDON CHANEY: Get a gun and shoot them, Prof. Come on!\nSTEPASHIN: I cannot. They are magnificent. Magnificent.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Enough! I won't warn you a second time.\nTHE DOCTOR: What now, Mr Devine? You've come away rather empty-handed, haven't you?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Shut up, I'm thinking.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Okay dokey, get moving, both of you.\nDON CHANEY: What ... what are those things, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: I haven't the foggiest. Mammalian, certainly, as our friend here put it so colourfully, they're like some form of giant bat. That sound.\nDON CHANEY: But they're so ... savage. How could creatures like that...?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yes, that had occurred to me too. They do act a little ... brusquely for supposedly intelligent creatures.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, they're young, aren't they? You know what young carnivorous alien mammal-like monsters are like. Always getting into scrapes.\nDON CHANEY: And you think someone's coming to find them?\nTHE DOCTOR: I do, and I have a nasty feeling that the grown-ups are even worse."

You've come away rather empty-handed, haven't you?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Shut up, I'm thinking.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Okay dokey, get moving, both of you.\nDON CHANEY: What ... what are those things, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: I haven't the foggiest. Mammalian, certainly, as our friend here put it so colourfully, they're like some form of giant bat. That sound.\nDON CHANEY: But they're so savage. How could creatures like that...?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yes, that had occurred to me too. They do act a little ... brusquely for supposedly intelligent creatures.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, they're young, aren't they? You know what young carnivorous alien mammal-like monsters are like. Always getting into scrapes.\nDON CHANEY: And you think someone's coming to find them?\nTHE DOCTOR: I do, and I have a nasty feeling that the grown-ups are even worse.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Move.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Let me go, you filthy great...\nNORIAM: What an interesting structure.\nSTREATH: Primitive.\nNORIAM: But see how it spans the water, enabling craft to move across it. Ingenious.\nSTREATH: Really? A race that has not even conquered basic gravitational forces is beneath our contempt.\nNORIAM: What is this structure called, hairless things?\nELLIS: What?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: It's a bridge.\nNORIAM: Bridge? Yes. Well, this must be conserved for the records.\nSTREATH: Hah. It will make a glorious spectacle, as it crashes in flames, like the rest of this benighted globe.\nNORIAM: Must we go through this every time?\nSTREATH: Naturally.\nNORIAM: The breeding party is concealed close by. In fact, they are within the metal structure, the ... bridge.\nSTREATH: Not for long. They shall be released from their bondage amongst these barbarians and set free. Free to destroy! Aah!\nNORIAM: Well ... w-we'll discuss it later, all right? For now let's content ourselves with finding them.\nTHE DOCTOR: They're getting closer. Which way?\nDON CHANEY: Er - down here.\nTHE DOCTOR: What now?\nTHE DOCTOR: Charley!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Thank heavens for that. Where did you get to?\nDON CHANEY: Ellis? What the...?\nELLIS: Boss. Boss, are you okay?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Don't get too excited, we've brought some ... friends with us.\nTHE DOCTOR: Ah. The grown-ups, I presume?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Good evening. My name is Cosmo Devine. I am in command here. If you want to see your lost property again you'll have to negotiate with me.\nSTREATH: Kill it!\nTHE DOCTOR: No, wait. This man is not in charge here. Erm, I am.\nSTREATH: In the name of the joint Second Principle, I must destroy.\nSTREATH: Destroy!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Naughty, naughty. I've got one of those too.\nCOSMO DEVINE: And you boys may be bigger than me, but I bet I could still make a whole mess of Jell-O out of those hairy old chests of yours.\nSTREATH: What does it say? Destroy!\nNORIAM: Streath, Streath, wait!\nNORIAM: We have come to find ship. Erm ... star fall from sky full of treasure. We give some to you, if you help us find it.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Who do you think you're talking to? Pocahontas?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (laugh) I think they've got the measure of you , Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Mm?\nNORIAM: Streath, I think it would be wise if I interrogated these two hairless things alone. Why don't you take these others to one side, and, er, calm down.\nSTREATH: (sigh.) Very well.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: It's all right, Charley, I'll be with you in a moment.\nSTREATH: Move!\nNORIAM: So, you both lay claim to represent the creatures of this world. Who am I to believe?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Well, me. I'm the one with the gun.\nNORIAM: Hmm. It is one of ours, is it not? You have rescued the breeding party?\nTHE DOCTOR: He has, but only by force of arms. He has no authority to speak for the people of this planet.\nCOSMO DEVINE: And you do? What is this, Victorian revival week? Just who are you\nCOSMO DEVINE: anyway?\nORSON WELLES: All right, Bix, I'm sorry, you can have my head on a goddamned plate if you...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Orson.\nORSON WELLES: Oh my God. Shot?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Right in the middle of his...\nORSON WELLES: I can see, Jack. Jesus, I Knew Biro had some shady friends, but this.\nDON CHANEY: So where the hell have you been, Ellis? I mean, the whole place is crawling with Nazis and monsters. Where was my number two?\nDON CHANEY: It was you, wasn't it? The one that was selling me out.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: This isn't the time for recriminations.\nELLIS: Jeez ... I'm sorry, boss. I tried to make things right, but ... oh hell, they're here now.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: And their little ones aren't far behind.\nNORIAM: Be quiet, hairless things! I grow weary of this. You are not of significance. We must recover the defective hatchlings and then revert to the ... invasion plan.\nTHE DOCTOR: Invasion plan?\nNORIAM: Certainly. We are the Laiderplacker, conquerors of Space.\nTHE DOCTOR: What, just the two of you?\nNORIAM: Of course not. Our ship teems with life an, erm ... invincible invading army that will lay waste to this wretched planet.\nTHE DOCTOR: You don't sound very convinced.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Ignore him. I want to help you.\nTHE DOCTOR: No, I-let me see. Breeding party? That's what you said, wasn't it? A breeding party. Oh, I think I've got it. What do you do, you - you shoot off a ship full of eggs or something onto different planets, let them hatch...\nNORIAM: Silence!\nTHE DOCTOR: ... cause chaos, scare the daylights out of the population and then you two turn up, and offer ... what?\nNORIAM: Er...\nTHE DOCTOR: Security. That's it, isn't it? It's a big bad universe out there. Is that what you're saying? You fool people into thinking they're vulnerable, and then ... It's a protection racket. A - an unbelievably huge protection racket. (Laughs.) Oh, that's good.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Is this true?\nNORIAM: A herd brother crashed on this world with his hatchling. Obviously the breeding failed. We have come to recover them.\nTHE DOCTOR: They didn't fail. They were just a little late.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Then you can continue as normal. Subjugate this world. Don't listen to him. Even if you don't have an army, your weapons are far in advance of what we have here. You can still conquer.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, under normal circumstances, yes.\nNORIAM: Explain?\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, as you say, little planets like this, they're vulnerable, and I'm afraid someone else has beaten you to it.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What on Earth are you talking about?\nTHE DOCTOR: What on Earth indeed. The fact is, my hairy friends, this planet has already been invaded.\nNORIAM: What?\nTHE DOCTOR: By Martians.\nNORIAM: Mar ... tians?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, Martians, from the planet Mars. Otherwise planet Sol Four, the red one you probably passed on your way in.\nCOSMO DEVINE: He's lying, don't listen to him.\nNORIAM: Your words are false.\nTHE DOCTOR: Are they? Would you believe that right now there's a squadron of Martian war machines marching across country to intercept you.\nNORIAM: Do you play a game, thing?\nTHE DOCTOR: No I do not. Your arrival here has not gone unnoticed. There are hostile invaders out to get you, bigger, nastier, hairier ones than you.\nSTREATH: Did you not try to resist them?\nTHE DOCTOR: Of course, but they're too strong. They're still arriving as we speak. Whole sections of the world are ignorant of their presence. Go now while you're still able. Let these people go. We'll gather up your chicks, and we can all go home.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No! This world is populated by trash and governed by weaklings. There are no invaders except yourselves. The Earth couldn't withstand any kind of properly-orchestrated assault.\nTHE DOCTOR: Look out!\nSTREATH: The hatchlings!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Stop them or I'll fire!\nNORIAM: A restraining signal, Streath, quickly.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I warned you.\nTHE DOCTOR: Everybody out now, we can get round them.\nELLIS: Out of my way.\nSTREATH: Stop...\nTHE DOCTOR: Charley, come on.\nDON CHANEY: Ellis!\nSTREATH: No. You come here.\nELLIS: No good, boss. I can't...\nNORIAM: A restraining sign... Oh don't bother, I'll do it myself.\nNORIAM: There. That should keep them quiet for a while. Ah, the prisoners have escaped, Streath. Call yourself a destroyer?\nSTREATH: There are still these hairless things.\nSTREATH: I shall take great pleasure in destroying them. Aah!\nCOSMO DEVINE: Gentlemen, we need to talk. I want to make a deal.\nSTREATH: Deal?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yes.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Nov ... it - it seems to me you've been running a rather modest operation. I don't think you quite realise your own potential. Okay, so there's just two of you, but you could be big.\nSTREATH: Big?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yeah. Look, the fellas I was formally doing business with looked like a good investment. Perhaps you've heard of them - the Nazis, booming economy, expansionist plans, neat black uniforms, all that jazz? But you guys seem like a far better proposition. As I say, you may not be the biggest noise in the Universe, but ... in a little backwater like Earth - well, if you stick with me, you could be in the market for a take-over, a global take-over.\nELLIS: You scum, Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: That's my name.\nNORIAM: You are proposing an alliance, Scum Devine?\nCOSMO DEVINE: No... No, I - I didn't ... Oh, never mind. An alliance? Well, let's call ita merger. I got the brains, you got the brawn. And I can tell you just where to hit this planet so it hurts most.\nSTREATH: Aah! And why should we not destroy you, along with this entire world?\nNORIAM: We can't destroy anything, Streath, and you know it. We ... haven't got the firepower.\nSTREATH: You promised me one of these planets. I could destroy.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Listen. A few well-judged strikes in the right places, this world could be mine ... ah-ah-ah ... ours. There's so much to enjoy here, so much to exploit.\nNORIAM: That is why we are here. Exploitation is the First Principle.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Then I guess we can do business together.\nNORIAM: Very well, Scum Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No, no...\nNORIAM: We will consider your offer.\nCOSMO DEVINE: My name is...\nNORIAM: We shall return the hatchlings to the ship, Scum Devine...\nCOSMO DEVINE: Stop calling me that!\nSTREATH: Then what are we to call you?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Something appropriate for the soon-to-be master of the world. Alexander the Great, perhaps. What do you think Ellis, mm?\nELLIS: How about Judas?\nCOSMO DEVINE: That's a little rich coming from you.\nELLIS: Tell me, how does it feel to betray your entire planet?\nCOSMO DEVINE: A lot like betraying your country, but just that teensy bit more satisfying. Oh dear, Fatty, you are tiresome. I think my first act as emperor of the world will be...\nCOSMO DEVINE: ...This.\nNORIAM: Why do you slay your own?\nCOSMO DEVINE: I'm a businessman. It was time to get rid of the dead wood.\nELLIS: See you ... in hell, Devine.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No doubt, but enjoy your head start.\nCOSMO DEVINE: As I say, trash, trash, trash.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Shall we go?\nDON CHANEY: That no-good lousy double-crossing fink! Why, I oughta...\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, well no doubt Mr Ellis is reflecting on the error of his ways right now.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Huh. I don't know who I'd rather be stuck with - those creatures or Cosmo Devine.\nTHE DOCTOR: Now look, Chaney, I've got an idea. What's the main broadcasting network in these parts?\nDON CHANEY: What, you mean like a ... like a radio?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes.\nDON CHANEY: CBS, I guess. Why?\nTHE DOCTOR: As I thought. Right. Now, you have contacts, yes? I mean, not all of your men were wiped out by Mr Devine's private army?\nDON CHANEY: Hey, the Don's got men everywhere. This is my city.\nTHE DOCTOR: I believe you, I believe you. Now, you're going to take us to CBS Studios and then I need you to mobilise some muscle, my friend. There's a blue box on the corner of ... Where was it, Charley?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Oh ... Broadway and...\nTHE DOCTOR: Broadway and Thirty-Fourth Street. If you can arrange to have the box brought to the studios, and ... you do have a car?\nDON CHANEY: Do I have a car? I got a Twenty-Nine Lamborghini. Used to belong to Capone.\nTHE DOCTOR: Come on, then!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Look here.\nORSON WELLES: Hmm?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: It's that memo recorder Biro was so proud of.\nCOSMO DEVINE: (tape) I Knew I could rely on those rather dubious underworld contacts of yours. I'm sure no-one need hear of them now.\nORSON WELLES: That's Cosmo Devine.\nBIX BIRO: (tape) Devine, you'll let Jimmy go?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: What the hell did he want with Bix Biro?\nCOSMO DEVINE: (tape) I only wish I could Mr Biro...\nORSON WELLES: Dropped by for a donation?\nCOSMO DEVINE: (tape) ...but he met with an accident a short time ago.\nBIX BIRO: (tape) Why, you...\nCOSMO DEVINE: (tape) Oh, there's just one more thing.\nCOSMO DEVINE: (tape) That's Mr Devine to you.\nORSON WELLES: Devine shot him!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Orson, this is turning into a very curious evening.\nCARLA: Mr Welles, the press boys are insisting on a statement. They've...\nORSON WELLES: Okay Carla, i-it's okay.\nCARLA: Oh, Mr Biro, oh my God, what happened...?\nORSON WELLES: Carla ... Carla, I want you to do something. I want you to go down to the lobby and fetch a policeman. Can you do that?\nCARLA: Oh my Lord...\nORSON WELLES: Can you do that, Carla?\nCARLA: Yes, sir.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: But Orson, are you sure? I mean, with the atmosphere down there...\nORSON WELLES: Yes, you're right. Perhaps it would be better if cooler heads prevailed. All right Carla, could you get me a number? I need to speak to someone at the Central Intelligence Agency.\nCARLA: Yes, sir. Oh my...\nORSON WELLES: Okay Jack, let's play that tape again, from the beginning.\nSTREATH: Look at this carnage. It's good, innit?\nNORIAM: Well, the hatchlings certainly made short work of these hairless things. Are they all under control now?\nSTREATH: Yes, and stored back on the ship. They will be unleashed again when the time comes to destroy...!\nSTREATH: Er ... If the time comes to destroy this world.\nNORIAM: Well then, I suggest we return to the ship to discuss this creature's idea of an alliance.\nSTREATH: Are we finished here?\nNORIAM: Most of the equipment is safely packed away, including the remains of the crashed ship. There's only the hatching tank left, and these few items.\nSTREATH: Oh! What are these? The hairless things must have been tinkering with our glorious technology!\nNORIAM: It may prove a useful study. I should like to conserve it all.\nSTREATH: Oh! Where are we going to put it! It'll just end up gathering dust in the corner!\nNORIAM: It is my duty as a Conserver.\nSTREATH: Oh! Very well. I'll put it in with the prisoner. At least it won't be under my feet.\nDON CHANEY: Ah, shut up!\nTHE DOCTOR: Quite a turn of speed, this car of yours.\nDON CHANEY: She's a beaut, ain't she, Doc? Not a scratch on her neither, except for the bullet holes in the door - some wise guy took a pop at Capone. Bam, bam, bam, bam!\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Eyes on the road, please.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah. So what's the plan, Doc? I still got a rendezvous arranged with the\nCIA: boys. You know, they could get the troops in, and...\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, I told you. This technology's too dangerous for anyone to get hold of, even the, er ... the good guys.\nDON CHANEY: Okay. So I get the blue box to CBS, then what?\nTHE DOCTOR: Then we shall see.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor, if there's just two of these aliens, then why are we getting so excited?\nTHE DOCTOR: Because despite Mr Devine's bluster, he was right. With an insider like him on their side, they can still cause unprecedented damage to this world.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: You have a plan?\nTHE DOCTOR: Of course. Tell me, Charley, are you fond of drama?\nORSON WELLES: Serious? Of course I'm serious. Look, could I speak to someone in authority? ... You are someone in authority? Well, you've got a mighty strange way of showing it ... My name? Yes, Welles. Orson Welles. No, I'm not joking. What? What did you say?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Don't tell me, they didn't believe you.\nORSON WELLES: Well, apparently they don't believe I'm Orson Welles, and if they did they would come round here and kick my butt for what we've just done.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Look at them down there. If we show our faces they'll tear us apart.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Oh, this is a mess.\nTHE DOCTOR: My thoughts exactly.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: What the devil...?\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh, it is you, isn't it?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Who?\nORSON WELLES: Who the hell are you?\nTHE DOCTOR: You're Orson Welles, as I live and breathe. I'm such a fan. I've seen all your films.\nORSON WELLES: But I haven't made any.\nTHE DOCTOR: Of course not, but you will, you will.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Mm?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Look.\nTHE DOCTOR: Oh dear. Poor fellow. Shot?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: Who was he?\nORSON WELLES: Bix Biro.\nTHE DOCTOR: His pen name?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: I beg your pardon?\nTHE DOCTOR: You must be...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: John Houseman, sir. You are...?\nTHE DOCTOR: A pleasure. I'm the Doctor. This is Charley.\nDON CHANEY: Okay, the blue box is on its way, Doc.\nORSON WELLES: Now what?\nTHE DOCTOR: And this is Mr Chaney.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Chaney?\nORSON WELLES: Don Chaney?\nDON CHANEY: Yeah. What's it to youse?\nORSON WELLES: You, er, you have this spaceship?\nTHE DOCTOR: Excellent. I don't have to bring you up to speed. Now, you've been working tonight, haven't you?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Yes.\nTHE DOCTOR: It's just as I thought! I knew I'd remembered correctly. The War of the Worlds, yes? You've panicked half the city into believing there's an alien invasion underway.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: So it would seem.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, there is.\nORSON WELLES: Are you a reporter?\nTHE DOCTOR: Gentlemen, I need your help. This planet is in grave danger. An extraterrestrial force has landed, and it'll probably be quite a job to get shot of them.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Are you serious?\nORSON WELLES: What do you want us to do?\nTHE DOCTOR: Can you get your actors back together again?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: What's all this in aid of?\nTHE DOCTOR: I'll explain later. Can you get them?\nORSON WELLES: I doubt if anybody could get through the mob outside.\nTHE DOCTOR: We did.\nORSON WELLES: But the police...\nDON CHANEY: Yeah, the cops and me have a ... an understanding.\nORSON WELLES: How reassuring.\nTHE DOCTOR: On second thoughts, we don't have time. We'll have to do some doubling up.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Care to enlighten us, Doctor?\nTHE DOCTOR: Once the TARDIS is here, all will become clear. Now, let's get to the studio.\nORSON WELLES: Whatever you say.\nTHE DOCTOR: Cheer up, Orson. The play's the thing, in which thou we'll the conscience of the King.\nORSON WELLES: Er, er, how's that?\nTHE DOCTOR: Hamlet.\nORSON WELLES: You've lost me there, Doctor, whoever you are.\nTHE DOCTOR: But sure...? Oh, never mind. Now, we'll need scripts.\nCOSMO DEVINE: This is outrageous! Keeping me in here like an animal. Oh, why I had to give up my weapon so easily. It was a gesture of good faith, you baboons! Oh well, I guess that's where good faith gets you.\nTHE DOCTOR: All right, everyone, are we all clear?\nORSON WELLES: I think so, Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: Remember, nothing must break the frame. Keep up the illusion as long as you can.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: We can't broadcast this again, they'll crucify us.\nTHE DOCTOR: Don't worry, this particular production is going out on a very special frequency, and to a very select audience. Orson?\nORSON WELLES: Okay, Mr Chaney, Jack, Charley. Shall we start with the weather forecast?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Just like before?\nORSON WELLES: Just like before. Go ahead.\nTHE DOCTOR: You're on!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Maximum temperature sixty-six, minimum forty-eight. This weather report comes to you from the Government Weather Bureau. We now take you to the...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (whispering) Now what?\nTHE DOCTOR: (whispering) I go into the TARDIS.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: ...Meridian room in the Hotel Park Plaza in downtown New York, where you will be entertained by the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.\nTHE DOCTOR: Now, a little tweaking. Where are you, where are you...?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (speaker) Er ... Ladies and gentlemen...\nTHE DOCTOR: Now, what sort of frequency would hit the spot?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (speaker) ... to bring you a special bulletin...\nTHE DOCTOR: This one?\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (speaker) ... from the intercontinental radio news...\nTHE DOCTOR: No, no. How about...\nTHE DOCTOR: Definitely not. Ah, maybe...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (speaker) ... Observatory, Chicago, Illinois. Reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas...\nCOSMO DEVINE: I thought we had a deal. Sticking me in here with all this...\nCOSMO DEVINE: ... junk!\nCOSMO DEVINE: What?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Hello? Is somebody ... in here with me?\nNORIAM: Come then, hairless thing. Destroyer Streath is most anxious to know the weak points in your world's defences.\nCOSMO DEVINE: (sigh.) And I can't wait to show him.\nNORIAM: Well, what is it?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Nothing. I - I thought I heard something.\nNORIAM: There is only the hatching tank and this ... detritus.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yes, yes, of course. Let's get out.\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) As I was saying, I was listening to the radio kinda halfways.\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) Yes Mr Wilmont, and then you saw something?\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) Not first off...\nTHE DOCTOR: That's it, Orson. Keep going.\nCOSMO DEVINE: At present, the main powers would be this country, the Soviet Union, France, England and the Germans. A systematic attack on those countries would in my opinion, leave the rest floundering.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (speaker) And what did you hear?\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) A hissing sound. Er, like this...\nNORIAM: What is that?\nSTREATH: We've been picking it up for some time. It appears to be the hairless things communicating.\nCOSMO DEVINE: It's just radio.\nSTREATH: This is happening now.\nCOSMO DEVINE: I guess. Don't worry about it.\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) ... something smacked to the ground, knocked me clear out of my chair.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (speaker) Well, were you frightened, Mr Wilmont?\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) I turned by head out the window...\nNORIAM: They appear to be reporting our arrival.\nSTREATH: Hah! Much good will it do them.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Listen, you can forget all this stuff about protection rackets - chicken-feed. One concentrated strike could completely disorientate them. The whole world's in a war fever anyway.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: How do we know it's working?\nTHE DOCTOR: Shh.\nORSON WELLES: Good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadows like a grey snake. Now it's another one and another one and another one. They look like tentacles to me ... There, I can see the thing's body, it's large, large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather.\nCOSMO DEVINE: And once morale starts to crumble...\nNORIAM: And tell me, what is your price for all this?\nCOSMO DEVINE: Oh, I don't want much. Dominion over America, or some such.\nSTREATH: Noriam! Listen!\nNORIAM: Streath! I am conducting...\nSTREATH: Listen!\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) ... face or monster or whatever it is...\nSTREATH: This is not a report of our landing.\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) Possibly gravity or something, the things rising up, the crowd falls back down...\nNORIAM: This planet is under attack.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No, no, no, it's a drama, a play. They were broadcasting it earlier.\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) I'll have to stop the description until I take a new position...\nSTREATH: Creatures from Mars. I have heard of them. A feared race of Warriors. You have tricked us, hairless thing.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No!\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) A humped shape is rising out of the pit, I can make out a tall beam of light against...\nSTREATH: The other hairless thing spoke the truth. You hoped to distract us, while your true allies launched their strike against the Earth.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What the hell are you talking about?\nNORIAM: Engines are initiated, Streath. I suggest we continue this conversation in orbit.\nSTREATH: Agreed.\nORSON WELLES: (speaker) ... spreading everywhere, it's coming this way. About twenty yards to my right...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (speaker) Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grover's Mill.\nSTREATH: Your death will be extremely prolonged, hairless thing. You have deceived us, and must pay the price.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What?\nNORIAM: I must say, I agree. In this case, destruction is necessary, and a long drawn-out nasty destruction at that.\nCOSMO DEVINE: No, it isn't real, I swear it!\nNORIAM: Take him back to the cell.\nSTREATH: Aah!\nTHE DOCTOR: Charley, pop into the TARDIS, would you, keep an eye on their position.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Are you off somewhere?\nTHE DOCTOR: No, I want to go.\nTHE DOCTOR: People of the Earth, your attention. Your planet is now under Martian control. Surrender is not an option. We intend to, er ... devastate your planet until it hangs like a cinder in Space. All life will be extinguished. We shall ... drain your rivers, er, level your mountains, annihilate your infestation from this world.\nTHE DOCTOR: How am I doing?\nORSON WELLES: Very good.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: I think they're on the move.\nDON CHANEY: It worked.\nTHE DOCTOR: Looks like it.\nORSON WELLES: Well Jack, it looks like we fooled 'em.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: That's twice in one night.\nNORIAM: That false creature. We have saved our skins by...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Look at them go...\nSTREATH: Listen!\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (speaker) Half-way gone with whatever passes for a tail between their legs.\nDON CHANEY: (speaker) It was quite a gamble Doctor.\nTHE DOCTOR: (speaker) Oh yes, but broadcasting on their own high frequency must have helped. It certainly rammed home the message ... What's that red light for?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (speaker) Oh God, we're still on the air.\nNORIAM: No! The Scum Devine spoke the truth. It was a trick!\nSTREATH: Aah! Return! Destroy, destroy, destroy!\nTHE DOCTOR: The signal's increasing, they're coming back.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Listen to me, he tricked you. Let me out of here.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What the hell? Professor?\nSTEPASHIN: Thank heavens.\nSTEPASHIN: It is you. Good, that is good. I was hoping to see you again.\nCOSMO DEVINE: But you ... I mean, those things.\nSTEPASHIN: Oh, those wonderful creatures. Wonderful, but deadly. I managed to crawl into the tank. It saved my life.\nCOSMO DEVINE: You're bleeding.\nSTEPASHIN: Da. I am not long for this world.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Yeah, well, I ... Look, I haven't got time for this. What have you got there?\nSTEPASHIN: This? This is a puzzle, Mr Devine. A question to which I hope soon to provide an answer, very soon.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Some sort of a machine. Is it theirs? The aliens, I mean?\nSTEPASHIN: No. It is mine. Constructed with a little help from their technology. I saved it from destruction, and here. Ah! Here is all that I need. They have brought all my experiments with them. Ah, they are wonderful creatures but not, I think, terribly bright.\nCOSMO DEVINE: What are you doing? Listen, I got to get out of here. These creatures are my ticket to the high life.\nSTEPASHIN: No, Mr Devine, I think not. Now, the answer to my question.\nCOSMO DEVINE: Question? What question?\nSTEPASHIN: Have you not guessed? (Laugh.) Saving the Earth is not a bad thing to die for, eh?\nCOSMO DEVINE: What the hell are you talking about?\nSTEPASHIN: The question is, am I, Yuri Stepashin, the first man to build a working atomic bomb?\nSTREATH: We will destroy all of it. Al! Every last atom.\nNORIAM: Except for the parts we conserve.\nSTREATH: Oh, shut up. you old fool! This is a time for action. I, Destroyer Streath, will plunge this Earth into a pit of flame, I shall watch its death-throes as I tear it apart stone by stone, boil away its waters, purge its devious hairless things in the pure flame of my unquenchable vengeance!\nNORIAM: Er ... what's that ticking?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: (radio) ... Which lit up the skies last night had nothing to do with the Mercury Theatre radio broadcast which caused panic over a wide area of the State. Astronomers say it is most likely another fragment of the meteorite which struck our atmosphere just over a month ago.\nTHE DOCTOR: Well, they obviously didn't get far. I wonder why. Still, rather neat, wasn't it?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Oh, there's a lot to be sorted out. Biro's death for one thing.\nORSON WELLES: Er, no, Jack, I got a call from the CIA, they ... have ways of covering up things like this. Actually they said they were expecting to hear from you, Mr Chaney.\nDON CHANEY: Yeah well, er, that all counts for squat now. No merchandise, no nothin’.\nTHE DOCTOR: Thankfully.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: But people must have seen things. I mean, spaceships over New Jersey?\nTHE DOCTOR: Mass hysteria, Charley, and thanks to Orson and his friends the CIA already have their cover story.\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Which reminds me. Time to face the music.\nORSON WELLES: The Press are outside?\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Uh-huh.\nORSON WELLES: Oh no. How do I look?\nTHE DOCTOR: You look like someone who's just about to become the most famous man in America.\nORSON WELLES: You think so? Say...\nJOHN HOUSEMAN: Come along, Orson.\nORSON WELLES: What do you think, Jack? Abjectly apologetic, or humble but proud?\nTHE DOCTOR: Don't let them cut Ambersons! Oh no, I mustn't interfere.\nDON CHANEY: Hey, Doctor. You're a resourceful guy. You want a job with prospects?\nTHE DOCTOR: Already got one, thank you. And if I were you, Mr Chaney, I'd find myself a quieter occupation.\nCHARLEY POLLARD: (chuckle.) Unlike us, I daresay. Hey, aren't we due in Singapore?\nTHE DOCTOR: Yes, and we're eight years late. Best be off. Goodbye, Mr Chaney.\nDON CHANEY: But where are you...\nCHARLEY POLLARD: Bye.\nDON CHANEY: Hey, what is this?\nDON CHANEY: Well, I'll be a...\nDON CHANEY: Trick or treat."
