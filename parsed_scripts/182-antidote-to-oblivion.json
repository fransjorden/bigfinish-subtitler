Bliss, Flip, perfect bliss, no rabid creatures trying to pull the universe from under our feet, no monsters, no Daleks yelling ‘ex-ter-minate’! This planet is well named, Tranquillity; that is just what it delivers. Yes, ahh... (SIGHS WITH SWEET CONTENTMENT) .. tranquillity.\nFLIP: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Mmm?\nFLIP: How long have we been here, exactly?\nDOCTOR: Flip, time no longer matters, it has no relevance; we can stay here for as long as we wish.\nFLIP: Yeah, but how long’s that gonna be?\nDOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea. The universe can get by without us for a few hours. Days. Aeons.\nFLIP: Aeons!?!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 3\nDOCTOR: Right now, I wish for nothing more than this sun, this sand... this hammock, swaying softly in this gentle breeze... and another refreshing glass of ‘Delicia’. (RATTLE OF ICE, DRINKS) Ahh. That’s the ticket.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 4\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 2: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: THE ROOM IS WAY UP INSIDE A TALL BUILDING. THERE IS LITTLE TRAFFIC\nNOISE: APART FROM THE FAINT WHOOSHING SOUNDS OF THE SKY CAR NETWORK IN THE SKY ABOVE. SIL AND PRESIDENT BOSCOE ARE ARGUING FIERCELY.\nSIL: No, Mr President, NO! You have exceeded your credit limit. I cannot countenance a further loan!\nBOSCOE: My dear Sil... The Universal Monetary Fund exists to service requests such as this.\nSIL: But not to submit to excessive demands without guarantees! No, Mr President. Concorp has come to my well once too often.\nBOSCOE: My request is on behalf of Concorpia. You are supporting not just a corporation, but a country, a nation!\nSIL: I have already put myself in jeopardy with my masters on Thoros Beta. I have recommended billions of credits in loans. My masters wish to know when and how you propose to pay them back?\nBOSCOE: We plan further austerity measures.\nSIL: Only radical cutting will do. You pay too much in benefits to the general population, to non-productive people.\nBOSCOE: I thought you had a plan. That little side project you’ve been working on in the Concorp medical centre...?\nSIL: That is private business! It has nothing to do with the U.M.F.!\nBOSCOE: Of course, of course. (SLY) But it would be personally compromising, would it not, were your U.M.F. masters to hear about the little venture you’ve embarked upon, using Concorp’s facilities? They might well perceive a conflict of interest.\nSIL: My dear President Boscoe, there is no need to resort to idle threats.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 5\nBOSCOE: They are not idle. I need a further influx of funds to keep our national budget viable.\nSIL: Well, how much more do you require?\nBOSCOE: Twelve billion universal credits.\nSIL: (SPLUTTERS IN SHOCK) Twe.. Twel.. Twelve?! Do you jest?\nBOSCOE: Should I approach one of your rivals, then? Perhaps Mistress Na will prove more... flexible.\nSIL: SOFTENS HIS STANCE EVEN MORE.\nSIL: Mr President, our association has long been of mutual benefit. There is no need for us to fall out over such a trivial amount. But should the U.M.F. reject your request, I trust you will appreciate that I have already lent you far more than my personal discretion allows...?\nBOSCOE: Enough of your snivelling, Sil. I must have re-financing. Do you wish for the population of Concorpia to rise up against us?\nSIL: The proletariat? (SHUDDERS) Nobody wants that, Mr President.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 6\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 3: EXT.

Wh— aaah!\nDOCTOR: SPILLING AND UPSETTING HIS DRINKS TABLE.\nDOCTOR: Very funny. Now look what you’ve made me do, you’ve made me spill my jug of Delicia!\nFLIP: Good.\nDOCTOR: Good?!\nFLIP: Yes, good — you, you hammock potato!\nDOCTOR: I’ve merely become, how would you say — chilled? Laid back?\nFLIP: Laid out, more like.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 4: INT. CONCORP — COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE\nDOCTOR WHO: BOB, A LACONIC TECHIE, IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH AN INTERPLANETARY\nCOMMUNICATIONS: LINK WITH SIL’S HOME PLANET. THERE IS STATIC AND A JUMBLE OF INTER-GALACTIC NOISE.\nSIL: What is happening? I wish to call Thoros-beta.\nBOB: Should’ve booked it earlier.\nBOB: There we go. Ugh, horrible distort on the picture, mind.\nSIL: There, on the screen, that is my master, the Lord Mav.\nBOB: That’s how he looks? That wrinkly old lizard?\nSIL: The Lord Mav, yes.\nBOB: I can’t sit looking at that; (GETTING UP) I’m off on my break.\nSIL: But I cannot hear what he is saying!\nBOB: (LEAVING) Press the speaker switch. (MUTTER) Put me right off my tea.\nSIL: Speaker switch... Ah!\nSIL: WITH A REEDY QUAVERY VOICE THAT HAS A SLIGHT DISTORTED QUALITY BECAUSE OF THE INTER-PLANETARY WOBBLE EFFECT.\nMAV: (D) [Sil! Sil! Are] you listening to me, Sil?!\nSIL: I am here, my Lord Mav. I hear you!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 8\nDOCTOR WHO: (D) At last. I was beginning to feel ignored. Now — I have received your request for yet more funds. Fourteen billion credits! After an initial loan of one trillion to this... Concorpia. Are you gambling with U.M.F. money, Sil?\nSIL: Perish the thought, Ancient Master.\nMAV: (D) ‘Concorpia’. Do I know them? Weren’t they once called something else? The — ‘Yuk’, is that right?\nSIL: The U.K., my Lord. Or ‘not so Great Britain’.\nMAV: (D) Oh, yes, we accepted their crown jewels as part of the bankruptcy settlement. Why are we interested in this tiny island, anyway? (SUSPICIOUS) Just what are you doing there, Sil?\nSIL: Concorp manufactures and exports P.P.M.C. drugs to the rest of the planet, my Lord.\nMAV: (D) P.P.M.-what?\nSIL: Population Pacification and Mind Control. An industry that could bring great prosperity to us as investors.\nMAV: (D) Ah, my second favourite word, next to profit. Mm, pros-per- ity, mm, pro-fit. Lovely. Well, go on.\nSIL: I can vouch for the integrity of Concorp, they have matters well in hand. Their society is stable, the people are docile. There are no political parties to worry about, just a President and a like- minded Board who govern the country.\nMAV: (D) Do they have any competition?\nSIL: Only an East World conglomerate state, Hang Seng, controlled so ably by my esteemed colleague, Mistress Na. But their research is lagging far behind that of Concorp, thanks to my guidance.\nMAV: (D) Then explain to my dull mind why, even with your sage advice, this Concorp outfit is so deeply in debt?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 9\nSIL: They have a large non-productive population, the work is mostly done by elite members of Concorp. Did you receive my analysis, Master?\nMAV: (D) I did, Sil. (READING OFF SCREEN) G.N.P., eighty-five per cent; no monopoly markets; unemployment seventy-one per cent; .. against\nMAV: a fourteen billion credit loan?! No, I cannot allow that amount.\nSIL: Master, please...\nMAV: (D) Not in full. Twelve billion credits is the maximum I can authorise at this time, but only if the loan repayment rate is increased by a further two per cent.\nSIL: Thank you, wise Lord Mav. I will put that to them.\nMAV: (D) Discipline, Sil; probity; integrity must be your watchword with these foreign creatures. You must instruct them in the ways of finance that has made Thoros Beta supreme. Others may wish to conquer all known worlds, but why bother when we can buy them up and take them over?

What’s the matter?\nFLIP: It’s just — (ANOTHER SIGH)\nDOCTOR: Am I to take it, Miss Jackson, that you are bored?\nFLIP: Tranquillity’s not exactly my scene, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, what would be more your scene, Flip? Bungee-jumping off the Colossus of Rhodes? Off-roading through the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Free-diving to the ruins of Atlantis?\nFLIP: All right, no need to get — Hang about. Atlantis? Seriously?\nDOCTOR: Depends which Atlantis, of course. There are several.\nFLIP: Any Atlantis. I’1ll take any Atlantis, any day [you like.])\nFLIP: AN ALARM FROM INSIDE THE TARDIS.\nFLIP: What’s that racket?\nDOCTOR: (UNEASY) Oh, that, nothing; nothing at all.\nFLIP: It’s coming from the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Is it? Oh, well, even if it is, it’s nothing to worry about.\nFLIP: You sure? Sounds like it’s gonna self destruct or something.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 11\nDOCTOR: No, nothing like that. Just ignore it, it will soon go away. I hope.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 6: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: IN.\nBOSCOE: Well, Sil? Did your masters agree to the loan?\nSIL: (TO BEARERS) Place me here, bearers, here! Beside Mr President! (TO BOSCOE) The U.M.F. has consented to advance Concorp a further twelve billion credits —\nBOSCOE: Good news!\nSIL: . but at an increased rate of interest. Three per cent!\nBOSCOE: That’s exorbitant, impossible. We will go elsewhere, these rates are beyond extortionate!\nSIL: Mr President, I quite agree. Might you be able to accept, say, two per cent extra?\nBOSCOE: Two-? (BEAT) Yes, all right, agreed.\nSIL: Contingent on one further condition.\nBOSCOE: What would that be, exactly?\nSIL: That you allow a representative of the U.M.F. to take a place on\nSIL: your board.\nBOSCOE: Was a name suggested?\nSIL: It was.\nBOSCOE: And?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: The name put forward was that of Sil.\nBOSCOE: What a surprise.\nSIL: I will be a most valuable addition, beside you in this Boardroom. You will need my guidance to implement the stringent measures that lie ahead, will you not, Amadeus? May I call you Amadeus, since it will be my hand plucking on your purse strings?\nBOSCOE: You can call me whatever you like, just pay that loan into the\nBOSCOE: Treasury.\nSIL: Right away, my dear Amadeus.\nSIL: HE CHORTLES A LITTLE.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 7: EXT. ALIEN BEACH\nFLIP: You’re not planning on sleeping through this racket?\nDOCTOR: (SLEEPILY) It will stop soon, distress signals usually do.\nFLIP: Distress-—? Did you say ‘distress signal’? (SHAKES HIS HAMMOCK — IT\nCREAKS: NOISILY) Doctor, what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Mind my hammock! — Oh, all right. Each TARDIS has a facility that sends out a distress call, for when a Time Lord finds themselves in extreme danger.\nFLIP: Like an SOS?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nFLIP: Shouldn’t we answer it, then?\nDOCTOR: Someone on Gallifrey is bound to have heard it by now.\nFLIP: Then why is the alarm still sounding?\nFLIP: THE ALARM BECOMES EVER MORE INSISTENT.\nDOCTOR: Just ignore it.\nI FLIP: I I can’t stand this noise. Do something, Doctor, right now!\nI DOCTOR: I Jt’s not my responsibility,!\nI FLIP: I What’s the matter with you? You feeling your age?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 15\nDOCTOR: I am no age at all, as Time Lords go. I’m in my prime, yes, my absolute prime, absolutely.\nFLIP: Buried in that hammock,, you don’t create that impression.\nDOCTOR: I know, but it’s so lovely.\nFLIP: Where’s your sense of adventure gone? How can you be deaf to a fellow Time Lord’s cry for help?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well,— I have to admit, a couple of things are beginning to bother me.\nFLIP: What’s the first?\nDOCTOR: Your somewhat flippant attitude to me, young lady.\nFLIP: And the second?\nDOCTOR: Why has that alarm been sounding so long? Something is wery much amiss. (FX: HAMMOCK CREAKS AS HE LEAPS OUT) Right, young Flip, duty calls,! Come on, stir your, sticks!\nFLIP: Me-?\nDOCTOR: (HEADING TO TARDIS) No use sitting around when there’s a soul in need of saving-!\nFLIP: Unbelievable.

ARE THE WHIRRS AND BEEPS OF COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC\nMONITORING: EQUIPMENT.\nSIL: Mistress Cordelia, what progress to report?\nCORDELIA: Your translator device needs adjustment, Sil. The term ‘mistress’ is misleading and most inaccurate.\nSIL: I’ve an upgrade on order, you must make allowances... my dear.\nCORDELIA: Just ‘Cordelia’ will suffice for our business dealings.\nSIL: Business, yes. What progress on our ‘special project’?\nCORDELIA: Nothing further since the last time you asked, which was yesterday.\nSIL: This does not please me. I can have this laboratory closed, your research funding withdrawn!\nCORDELIA: Virological research is a complicated process. I am taking pains to ensure the antidote is a complete success.\nSIL: Pain? You are causing me pain with your shally-shillying! [SIC]\nCORDELIA: You promised me another Time Lord. Where is he?\nSIL: Moves are afoot. But please... Cordelia... try not to spoil him, the way you did the last!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 9: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: FIDDLES WITH CONTROLS.\nDOCTOR: That’s odd. The call seems to be emanating from Earth, but I can’t seem to fix the temporal co-ordinates. Let’s try again, shall we...?\nFLIP: (LOUD, OVER NOISE) Yeah, can you find the ‘mute’ button while you’re about it?\nDOCTOR: Better?\nFLIP: Just a bit.\nDOCTOR: Now, those co-ordinates. There they go, spinning, spinning...\nFLIP: Forward or back?\nDOCTOR: Forward from your time, I think... yes, the year twenty-three eighty-two! Twenty-fourth century, can’t remember too much about that period.\nFLIP: I certainly can’t.\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s your call to adventure, Miss Jackson.\nFLIP: Let’s answer it, ay?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 10: INT. CONCORP — PRESIDENTIAL APARTMENT\nBOSCOE: (DISTASTE) How are the ‘marsh minnows’, Sil?\nSIL: (MOUTH FULL) Acceptable, a trifle better than your last attempt, Mr President.\nBOSCOE: Fish are a rare commodity. I had our vitro food designers build you a replica product specially.\nSIL: Won’t you be joining me?\nBOSCOE: I seem to have lost my appetite.\nBOSCOE: I must say, the meeting went well. Your ideas seemed reasonably well received by the rest of the Board.\nSIL: Apart from that woman person.\nBOSCOE: Kristal? Yes, Kristal is something of a liberal recidivist; she is our voice of conscience, not to be taken account of.\nSIL: Most wise, most wise, but your main economic problem remains. Too many mouths to feed, too many unearned home comforts. Their benefit payments are the reason I have been sent here to find a radical solution to resolve your dilemma.\nBOSCOE: At least civil unrest is not a factor we need concern ourselves with.\nSIL: Thank the Great Morgo for that.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 11: INT. TUBE PLATFORM/TUNNEL\nFLIP: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere underground.\nFLIP: Not just somewhere underground. The Underground! The Tube! Where I first met you, sort of.\nDOCTOR: I must say, Flip, you have the eyesight of a nocturnal animal. I can barely make out a thing in this gloom.\nFLIP: Me neither, but I’d know the smell anywhere. Oily engines and sweaty passengers, eurgh.\nDOCTOR: (RUMMAGING) Hold on, I usually keep a torch in the pockets of my coat...\nFLIP: That coat of yours could light the way on its own.\nDOCTOR: (PRODUCING TORCH) Ah-ha!\nFLIP: What did I tell you? Embankment.\nI DOCTOR: I No use waiting for a train, I believe there hasn’t been one for, I quite some time.\nI FLIP: Yeah, ‘We are sorry for the three-hundred year delay to your journey and apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.’ All I right, then: which way to the TARDIS in distress?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 20\nDOCTOR: All in hand. If you could just take the torch? — Thank you. (PRODUCING SOMETHING ELSE FROM POCKETS) We can triangulate its position by using this handy little gizmo I picked up at the Garazone Bazaar.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and what it’s telling me is we go... that-a-way.\nFLIP: What, into the tunnel? Looks dead creepy, a real rat hole.\nDOCTOR: (TEASING) Why — don’t you like rats, Miss Jackson?\nFLIP: It’s not that I don’t like rats. I just don’t think they’1ll like me.\nDOCTOR: Did I never tell you about the time I spent as a ratcatcher in Hamelin? (JUMPS OFF PLATFORM; CALLS UP) Come on, hop down off the platform.\nDOCTOR: Yes, ‘Dust of ages...’\nFLIP: Most of it in my throat. (COUGHS)\nFLIP: THEY START TO WALK INTO THE TUNNEL.\nFLIP: (WALKING) Wonder how long it’s been since these tracks were live?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) A long time indeed, judging by the depth of oxide coating. They’re almost rusted away.\nFLIP: (WALKING) Rusted? Down here?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 21\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Well, the River Thames is directly above our heads. Without regular maintenance, moisture will soon seep through.\nFLIP: (COUGHS AGAIN) Moisture, yes — tell you what, Doctor, I could really use something to drink.\nDOCTOR: I’d have brought some Delicia with us, but someone made me spill the last of my supply. — Look now, there’s an opening ahead!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 12: INT. TUBE PLATFORM\nCERISE: Anything in there, Pan?\nPAN: Not today. Rats are intelligent, they’re getting wise to the traps.\nCERISE: So hungry, Pan. It’s been days now.\nPAN: You were right, Cerise. It’s no good waiting for the food to come to us, [we’ll have to go hunting. ]\nFLIP: (OFF, APPROACHING — TALKING TO DOCTOR) Hang about, I thought the Piper was the bad guy?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, APPROACHING) The legend got garbled in the telling, of course. No, all was not as it seemed, in the mountains of Lower Saxony in the year 1284...\nCERISE: (ALARM) Pan...! Pan! There, in the tunnel! Bakerloonies!\nPAN: (CALLING OUT) You two — get away, we’ve got nothing you want!\nDOCTOR: I do beg your pardon. Is yours a private platform?\nCERISE: Please! It’s the end of the month, we’ve spent all our credits.\nPAN: (THREATENING) You don’t belong here, get back to your own line!\nFLIP: You mean, like the Bakerloo line?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin\nCERISE: Yes, where else?\nPAN: This is the Northern line. We are Northernliners.\nCERISE: We have no truck with Bakerloonies.\nDOCTOR: Well, we are not of the Bakerloo persuasion.\nCERISE: Liar! That’s what Bakerloonies do — lie and cheat, sneak\nCERISE: tunnels, steal our food and water.\nFLIP: Water, you have water?\nPAN: Not fresh. Only bottled.\nFLIP: Even better.\nDOCTOR: Look, do you mind if we come up onto the platform?\nCERISE: Watch him, Pan.\nDOCTOR: down\nDOCTOR: Page 23\nDOCTOR: We mean you no harm. We’re searching for a fellow traveller who may be in serious trouble. But if you could spare my young friend\nDOCTOR: a little water, it would be much appreciated.\nFLIP: Just leave it, Doctor. I’1l go without.\nCERISE: “Doctor”?\nPAN: Give the girl some water, Cerise.\nCERISE: You’re sure?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 24\nPAN: If they were Bakerloonies, they wouldn’t ask, they’d take. Besides — look at her, she’s desperate, she’s ready to tox out. [IE,\nTHINKS: SHE’S AN ADDICT]\nCERISE: All right... Here, catch!\nFLIP: (CATCHING IT) Whoa!\nCERISE: Have the lot, it’s nearly empty.\nFLIP: Are you sure-?\nPAN: We only kept it for emergencies.\nFLIP: Cheers, then. (DRINKS) Oh, that is so good... Mm, thank you. (OFFERING BOTTLE) Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: No, thank you. I’m still full of Delicia.\nCERISE: Are you really a doctor?\nDOCTOR: Well...\nCERISE: I’m a doctor. Well, at least I was a doctor — until they brought in robo-scans.\nDOCTOR: ‘They’, being?\nPAN: Concorp, of course. I was a pharmacist, until Concorp closed down all non-company outlets. What’s she to you, the girl?\nDOCTOR: Miss Jackson is — well, you could call her my assistant.\nCERISE: Like a nurse?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 25\nFLIP: (HAVING DRAINED BOTTLE) Some of the time, yeah. Oh, that’s better.\nPAN: You’1ll be on your way now, then?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think so.\nPAN: Way Out’s at the far end of the platform. The stairs’1ll take you above ground.\nDOCTOR: Yes — now we’re on the other side of the river, above ground is\nDOCTOR: where we need to be. Ready, Flip?\nFLIP: Ready? Me?\nDOCTOR: (ODD) Yes, you.\nFLIP: Me, I’m ready. I’m ever ready, me. (SHE GIGGLES FOR NO REASON)\nDOCTOR: Are you quite all right, Miss Jackson?\nFLIP: Never better!\nPAN: (SLIGHT DISGUST) Now she’s had her water fix.\nFLIP: Exactly!

(CALLING BACK) You were right, Flip — I’m a Time Lord, not a beach bum.\nFLIP: (STOPS, SPACED OUT) Beach bum. Cool. You are so cool, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) If anything, I’m a little overheated.\nFLIP: (GIGGLES) You’re dead funny, too.\nDOCTOR: Cool, dead and funny? Well, it wouldn’t be much of an epitaph, but it’d do. Come on, not much further now. I think I see daylight.\nDOCTOR: Flip? This is no place for a sit-down. Once we’re above ground, I can recalibrate the location of this TARDIS in distress.\nFLIP: I was just thinking — we’re so lucky, Doctor. So very very lucky.\nDOCTOR: Flip? Is something the matter?\nFLIP: (DREAMILY) No, no. I just want to sit here and think about how lucky we are. Don’t you think we’re lucky, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Being stuck on a broken-down escalator covered in several centuries’ worth of accumulated grime is not my idea of luck.\nFLIP: But it’s so high. It’s amazing.\nDOCTOR: Flip, look at me. Open your eyes, wide, wider. Yes, as I thought. (HAULING HER UP) Come on, let’s get you up on your feet.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 27\nFLIP: (FLOPPY) Just leave me here, Doctor.

I love the rain, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Flip, listen to me. I think the water you were given back there must have been contaminated.\nFLIP: Whatever.\nDOCTOR: Contaminated with a sedative of some sort, maybe even a psychotropic drug. Whatever it contained is affecting your personality; your perception, too.\nDOCTOR: BEAT.\nFLIP: Pffaww, I feel just great. Have you seen, it’s raining? Rain, wow!\nDOCTOR: It’s nothing to get excited about. Now: whatever this poison is, we need to flush it out of your system, fast. — (REALISATION) It’s raining!\nFLIP: I told you..! Isn’t it amazeballs?\nDOCTOR: Rainwater, that’s what we need. Here, Flip — you see that\nDOCTOR: drainpipe? I’m going to pull it off the wall.\nFLIP: Ooh, you rebel!\nDOCTOR: It’s not vandalism, it’s a medical emergency-!\nDOCTOR: A TORRENT.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin\nDOCTOR: There, that’s got it.\nFLIP: It’s like a waterfall... Cool.\nDOCTOR: Page 29\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it just.

I wish to see how my skin glistens and sparkles, such a lovely shade of green, deeply verdant and lustrous. (MORE WATER) Oh, argg, oooh! (PLEASURE), Such perfect, volcanic mineral water. Pity it costs so much to have it tankered in from the planet Tigus... but sooner that than imbibe so much as a Single drop from the pulbic water supply, hmm? (BEAT) More, slave! More! (GURGLES)\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 16: EXT. SOUTH BANK\nDOCTOR WHO: ACROSS THE SKY FROM TIME TO TIME.\nDOCTOR WHO: A SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE IS PLAYING ABOVE WHERE THE DOCTOR AND FLIP\nARE: SEATED.\nAUTOMATIC: VOICE\nAUTOMATIC: . You are seated opposite the place where democracy died one hundred and fourteen years ago, along with the politicians that had brought ruin to the nation formerly known as the United Kingdom. How fortunate that a company of Concorp’s stature and integrity was able to buy up the nation’s last remaining assets [in order to revitalise not only the economy, but also the happiness of all the people. Concorp loves you. ]\nFLIP: COMES AWAKE WITH A START.\nFLIP: What, where — what’s that voice?\nDOCTOR: Back with us, Miss Jackson-? Good.\nFLIP: Oh, I’m soaking. — Hang about, isn’t this the South Bank?\nDOCTOR: In your time, perhaps. Here in the twenty-fourth century, it appears to be part of what’s known as the Westminster theme park — as this rather handy tourist information post has been telling me, repeatedly, throughout the time you’ve been asleep.\nFLIP: Asleep? Have I been out of it long?\nDOCTOR: Long enough. The water you were given contained a cocktail of drugs that distorted your sense of reality.\nFLIP: Those two freaks in the underground — they gave me spiked water! Why?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. But while I’ve been sitting here waiting for you to recover your senses I’ve been watching the people passing by, all of them with happy grins on their faces, all praising the beauty of the riverside.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 32\nFLIP: Beauty? It’s a complete dump! Look at the river, it’s all choked up with rubbish!\nDOCTOR: Certainly, there’s no water flowing. Nothing to drink here. Well, nothing other than bottled water labelled with the logo of this company, ‘Concorp’.\nFLIP: What, so everyone’s drinking the same dodgy water?\nDOCTOR: Everyone I’ve seen passing by, yes. And look — there’s that logo again, at the top of that vast skyscraper over the river.\nFLIP: So it is! (REALISATION) Hold on. That broken-down ruin it’s sticking out of — isn’t that...?\nDOCTOR: The Houses of Parliament, yes. Which is where I believe our TARDIS distress call is coming from.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 17: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nKRISTAL: Mr President, are you suggesting that our main chemical factories may have been sabotaged?\nBOSCOE: Nothing of the sort, Kristal. An unfortunate accident.\nKRISTAL: But they are out of action?\nBOSCOE: Only on a temporary basis.\nSIL: I do not welcome this word ‘sabotage.’\nBOSCOE: It is merely one of many possible causes being investigated.\nSIL: Disruption to the P.P.M.C. programme could be very costly! It might lead to insurgency! Insurrection!\nBOSCOE: That is why I have already commenced negotiations with an outside provider, to ensure that we are fully stocked.\nKRISTAL: ‘Another provider’ — do you mean the Hang Seng?\nBOSCOE: As I say, we are in negotiations.\nKRISTAL: Mr President — the Hang Seng are our greatest rivals, they’d like to see us reduced to rubble, how can we possibly [trust them? ]\nSIL: Oh! That’s me. Excuse me, Mr President... woman.\nBOSCOE: Can’t it wait, Sil?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 34\nSIL: (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Cordelia! Is this important?\nCORDELIA: (D, THROUGH COMMUNICATOR) You instructed me to inform you the moment there was any development in the Time Lord situation.\nSIL: Well, what has happened?\nCORDELIA: (D) Two unregistered consumers appear to have answered our call.\nSIL: What — are they are in the jaws of the trap?\nCORDELIA: (D) Almost.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 18: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS — CORRIDOR\nFLIP: What happened here? Did Guy Fawkes get resurrected or something?\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) What-?\nFLIP: He wanted to blow up this place, he’d be pleased to see it’s nowa demolition site.\nFLIP: Sounds like we’re getting warm.\nDOCTOR: (HURRYING) I think it’s in the main chamber!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 19: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS — MAIN CHAMBER\nFLIP: Oh, wow! This is it, isn’t it? — Just like on the telly. Well, except without all the chinless baldies going ‘rar, rar’ at each other, and some bloke in a dress droning on about ‘the ayes on the right’ —\nDOCTOR: (SOFTLY) Eyes straight ahead, Flip.\nFLIP: That’s bonkers. It looks like a — a tree. An old oak tree, growing out of the floor.\nDOCTOR: It’s not a tree, Flip. Ah, no, no, not him!\nFLIP: What’s the matter, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That’s not an oak tree, it’s a TARDIS. And I know just who it belongs to...!\nFLIP: Why have you gone whiter than white?\nDOCTOR: Because that is the TARDIS belonging to Anzor!\nFLIP: Anzor?\nDOCTOR: A bully who made my life a misery, back on Gallifrey. — only Come on, Flip, we're leaving.\nFLIP: What, after all the trouble we went to, to get here?\nDOCTOR: If Anzor’s in trouble, he’s welcome to it.\nFLIP: Get a grip, Doctor. We’re here now, aren’t we? (WALKING UP TO TREE) So how do we get into it? Knock on the tree trunk, pull ona branch, or what?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 37\nDOCTOR: If Anzor was here, he’d have shown his face by now. (TURNING) But he hasn’t, so —\nSIL: (FROM DOORS BEHIND) Ah, Doctor. How very good of you to answer my call.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. You-!\nFLIP: That’s him? That green thing?\nDOCTOR: That’s not Anzor, Flip. No — that particular monstrosity is known as Sil.\nSIL: Guards, cover both sides! — So, Doctor, I see you have another female ‘companion’. Good, she can join you in assisting my latest enterprise.\nDOCTOR: Your last ‘enterprise’ ended in total disaster. The definition of insanity, Sil, is to repeat actions that always bring about the same negative result.\nSIL: Not this time, Doctor. Guards, are your weapons primed? — Then\nSIL: fire, you dullards, FIRE!\nSIL: AND THE DOCTOR. SIL LAUGHS WITH MANIACAL INTENSITY.\nSIL: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 38"

I drank this dodgy water and then, like, we were in the House of Commons with this horrible sort of slug-man thing who had us both shot!\nDOCTOR: For a time, I imagined I was back on Tranquillity. Alas, when I woke up, I was stuck here with you in this cell.\nFLIP: Cell? You mean —\nDOCTOR: You have rather less of an imagination than I do, young lady. Unfortunately, it seems that Sil had his guards’ guns set to stun, not to kill.\nFLIP: What do you mean, ‘unfortunately’?\nDOCTOR: I mean that whatever Sil has planned for us, it can only be worse\nDOCTOR: than death.\nFLIP: Worse? How?\nDOCTOR: I imagine we’re about to find out.\nDOCTOR: SIL, CARRIED BY HIS BEARERS, ENTERS.\nSIL: Place me down opposite to the prisoners. Not too near, out of their reach, you oafs! — yes, here, so I can gaze at our guests in\nSIL: perfect safety. (BEAT) Doctor. What a sublime pleasure to meet with you once more.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 39\nDOCTOR: The feeling is not reciprocated, Sil.\nFLIP: Where are we? What are you going to do to us?\nSIL: Your new home is here in the research laboratories at Concorp HQ, where you will shortly donate your repulsive persons to the advancement of medical science. (GURGLES WITH PLEASURE) How fortunate, Doctor, that it should have been you who chose to answer my call.\nDOCTOR: Your call? So where’s Anzor?\nSIL: Your fellow Time Lord is also in... custody. (LAUGHS)\nFLIP: Sil — that’s your name, right? Shouldn’t you be looking for a stone to crawl back under?\nSIL: Your new little friend fails to amuse me, Doctor. Haven’t you told her what happened to your last female companion? — now what was her name? Terry? Jerry? Merry? Not so merry at the finish, eh?\nDOCTOR: Her name was Peri.\nSIL: And where is she now, Doctor? Hm?\nDOCTOR: Te\nCORDELIA: Sil? I’m ready to begin.\nFLIP: (TAKING THE MICKEY) Ah, here we go.. A woman in a white coat. She come to take you away, has she Sil?\nSIL: Allow me to introduce Miss Cordelia, in charge of this laboratory.\nCORDELIA: So this is the infamous Doctor. The girl, who is she?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 40\nDOCTOR: Her name is Phillipa Jackson.\nFLIP: Flip for short.\nCORDELIA: Fascinating. Guards — bring them through to the laboratory hub.\nSIL: After you.\nFLIP: No, after you.\nSIL: Females first.\nFLIP: Ladies first, you dummy.\nSIL: Whatever, move her along.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 21: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY [CONTINUOUS ]\nDOCTOR: Your laboratory seems remarkably well-equipped, Miss Cordelia. It reminds me of that time I was in Geneva with that doctor — oh, what was his name...?\nFLIP: Is this really the time for one of your reminiscences, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: . Frankenstein, that was it.\nCORDELIA: Very amusing.\nDOCTOR: Tell me, what’s it all in aid of?\nCORDELIA: You Time Lords have a natural immunity to a great many of the diseases at large in the microbial universe.\nDOCTOR: We’re a resilient bunch, that much is true.\nCORDELIA: I intend to break you down, piece by genetic piece, to isolate each and every one of those immunities.\nDOCTOR: For what purpose? To combat some disease? Is there an epidemic?\nCORDELIA: Not yet.\nFLIP: Why the Doctor? Why not this ‘Anzor’?\nSIL: The female really is as stupid as she seems.\nDOCTOR: I thought Anzor had been transported back to the antediluvian Swamps. What did you do to him, Sil?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 42\nSIL: We used data records taken from his TARDIS to unlock his time transmission settings and recall him to the present. He was a most unwilling participant in our research project, alas for him.\nDOCTOR: What did you do?\nCORDELIA: Owing to a malfunction within the isolation chamber, Anzor suffered some cellular transmogrification.\nSIL: He emerged not in the form he went in. (CHUCKLES)\nDOCTOR: So you used his TARDIS, to help you summon another Time Lord?\nSIL: Not any other Time Lord, Doctor. Before he went in the chamber, Anzor was keen to explain to us how we might target a distress call at your TARDIS, in particular.\nFLIP: Charming. You mean he tried to bargain the Doctor’s life for his own?\nDOCTOR: That’d be true to form.\nFLIP: Well, whatever he got, it sounds like he deserved it.\nCORDELIA: The Time Lord known as Anzor was indeed a repulsive specimen.\nSIL: What was it he called you, Miss Cordelia? ‘Witch’, that was it. ‘Harpy.’ ‘Harridan.’\nCORDELIA: Amongst other discriminatory terms, unacceptable in civilised society.\nFLIP: Sounds a right laugh.\nSIL: Would you like to meet him?\nFLIP: Not really.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 43\nSIL: Oh, but I’m sure the Doctor would. Cordelia, show the Doctor the present state of his fellow Time Lord.\nCORDELIA: (CROSSING TO WALL) Now where did I put him?\nSIL: Try the upper shelf.\nCORDELIA: (COLLECTING BOX) Ah, yes — here he is, hiding amongst the toxin\nCORDELIA: samples.\nFLIP: But that’s just some titchy box. What’s in there?\nDOCTOR: Anzor’s ashes, perhaps?\nCORDELIA: See for yourselves.\nMINI: ANZOR Fiddlesticks! Fiddlesticks!\nFLIP: Ugh! How the-?!\nSIL: Lift him out, Cordelia, lift him out!\nCORDELIA: There.\nDOCTOR: That is Anzor?\nFLIP: That pink potato? With his eyes on sticks? That’s just rank!\nDOCTOR: How did this happen?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 44\nCORDELIA: A malfunction of the chromosomes whilst he was inside the isolation chamber. It is unlikely to occur again.\nSIL: Fortunate for you, Doctor, that the mistake was made on Anzor — Since you are the next in line to enter Cordelia’s chamber of horror!\nCORDELIA: Guards! Prepare these two for decontamination!\nFLIP: Wait, wait! What’s with the ‘they’?\nDOCTOR: Miss Jackson is not a Time Lord.\nCORDELIA: Every experiment needs a control procedure. Inevitably, she will expire first, but it will be of some interest to see how long you can outlast her.\nFLIP: That’s horribibble! [SIC]\nSIL: (GURGLES) Cordelia, may I beg a favour? May I keep Anzor as a pet?\nCORDELIA: He is of no further use to me.\nSIL: Thank you. Oh, look the way his eye stalks wave about, just like Swamp reeds in the wind.\nMINI: ANZOR Fiddlesticks! Fiddlesticks!\nCORDELIA: That’s for you, Sil.\nSIL: Oh, what is it now? (CHECKING COMMS UNIT) It appears that President Boscoe has called an Extraordinary Board Meeting. I must attend.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 45\nDOCTOR: Well, don’t let us stop you.\nSIL: I will go at once. Bearers, lift... Not too quickly, you doltards! Cordelia, do not start the infective procedures until I return.\nCORDELIA: They will be prepped and ready...\nSIL: Oh, I will look forward to that. (LAUGHS AS HE IS BORNE AWAY)\nCORDELIA: Guards! Come on, get to it!\nDOCTOR: Cordelia, what is it you want, exactly? Ask, and I can help.\nCORDELIA: The reaction of your metabolism to viral and bacterial onslaught will provide me with all the answers I need, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Cordelia, you are clearly a hugely intelligent young woman. And I warn you: whatever he’s promised you, this association with Sil will bring you [no good]\nCORDELIA: Be quiet! I know all about you, Doctor; your twisted tongue, your devious mind.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nCORDELIA: Whatever it is you’re about to say, I know full well that it is designed to deceive me.\nFLIP: You sure you’ve got the right Doctor?\nCORDELIA: Exactly the right Doctor. A coward who I’ve long wished to destroy.\nDOCTOR: What?!\nCORDELIA: (TO GUARDS) Decontaminate them!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 22: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nSIL: Emergency? Great Morgo, give me strength! The only words I seem to I hear in this Boardroom are crisis and emergency!\nBOSCOE: Because that is exactly what we are faced with.\nSIL: Do, please, enlighten me, Mr President.\nBOSCOE: A trade dispute has escalated into a crisis. We are running short of the drug narcoplaximine. We have only a few days supply remaining. Unless we can maintain a sufficient level in the public water supply millions of angry sleepers will awaken.\nKRISTAL: The Gen-Pop will see things as they really are.\nBOSCOE: Turn against the Consumer Corporation [FULL NAME FOR CONCORP]; seek bloody revenge against those who have fed them dreams and visions of unreality.\nSIL: (ALARM) Oh dear. Are we well protected?\nKRISTAL: Not against the will of the people.\nBOSCOE: Nothing could withstand their anger.\nSIL: (SOME PANIC) Purchase the drug, manufacture it, obtain supplies! We can’t allow the proles to get above themselves!\nBOSCOE: We suspect Hang Seng agents are behind the recent sabotage of our pharma factories. We also believe they are creating a worldwide shortage of the drug we seek. They wish to foment revolution so as to bring Concorp to ruin. To cover the shortfall in our drug supply until production can resume will require a further loan of three billion credits.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 47\nSIL: Three?!\nBOSCOE: That is the price your colleague, Mistress Na, demands.\nSIL: What was done with the last load of credits I authorised?\nKRISTAL: Spent on the status quo, and repaying exorbitant U.M.F. loan rates.\nSIL: Preposterous, my masters will not countenance another request.\nBOSCOE: Need they know?\nSIL: They will when they review my account at month’s end. Reckoning will pour down upon poor Sil then. Unless... yes, I would have to explain the situation, explain how I think such a loan could be repaid, how Concorp could regain solvency. Yes, yes... but I would have to propose a truly radical solution to solve your chronic insolvency. My masters would welcome that.\nBOSCOE: How radical?\nSIL: Something I have been working on for just such an emergency Situation. A scheme to drastically reduce your parasitical population.\nKRISTAL: How? We can’t starve them.\nSIL: Well, of course not! It would take far too long. No, the quickest\nSIL: means is introduce them to our old friends, pestilence and plague!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 23: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nELECTRONIC: PARTICLES.\nFLIP: I’m all atingle, what’s this thing doing to us?\nDOCTOR: We’re undergoing a thorough cleansing. This is an electronic particle dispenser, designed to cleanse us of all known germs.\nFLIP: I’ve never taken a shower with my clothes on before.\nDOCTOR: It seems our ‘Miss Cordelia’ wants us free of infection — presumably so she can then re-infect us with whatever nasties she likes, under laboratory conditions.\nFLIP: The way she looks at us — those cold blue eyes... She doesn’t think much of me but she really seems to have it in for you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can’t imagine why. I’ve never met her before, I’m sure of that. That said, there is something oddly familiar about her...\nCORDELIA: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Bring them through.\nDOCTOR: (EXITING INTO MAIN AREA) Well, here we are, scrubbed up and squeaky clean.\nFLIP: You could eat your dinner off us.\nCORDELIA: Guards — escort the subjects to the isolation chamber.\nFLIP: (SHOVED) Ow, who you pushing...?\nDOCTOR: No point resisting, Flip, we are entirely helpless. Completely in the power of Miss Cordelia... what did you say your name was again?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 49\nCORDELIA: You don’t know who I am, do you?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not.\nCORDELIA: Look closer, then. It’s often said I have my father’s eyes.\nDOCTOR: Your father-? Did I know him at all?\nCORDELIA: More than that, Doctor. You were the person responsible for my father’s death!\nFLIP: You what-?\nCORDELIA: My full name is Cordelia Clare Crozier.\nDOCTOR: (REMEMBERING) ‘Crozier’..?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 24: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nSIL: Fellow members of this Board, I regret to inform you that soon, Concorpia may well suffer outbreak after outbreak of certain... unpleasant diseases.\nKRISTAL: What sort of diseases?\nSIL: Alien diseases, against which humankind has no immunity. Fortunately, and under my own expert supervision, a young scientist based within this very building is busy harvesting a number of protective vaccines.\nBOSCOE: Antigens to protect all necessary members of our society.\nKRISTAL: Such as?\nSIL: Those of us on this Board, for example. Everybody else, however...\nKRISTAL: . what, dies? How can this be contemplated? Mr President?\nBOSCOE: Not every last member of the Gen Pop would perish, Kristal.\nSIL: I estimate forty-five per cent —\nKRISTAL: (‘THAT MANY?!’) Forty-five?!?\nSIL: . would survive the initial outbreaks. There would be a second wave, of course, to mop up that many again.\nBOSCOE: Concorpia can tolerate a rump ten per cent of especially fit individuals, for unskilled labour.\nSIL: (GRUMBLES) That figure still seems a little high to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 25: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nFLIP: Is it true, Doctor? Did you know Cordelia’s dad?\nDOCTOR: Young Crozier? — I met him, certainly, on the planet of the Mentors. A quite brilliant brain surgeon, who sought to conquer Death itself.\nCORDELIA: Which is why you had him killed!\nDOCTOR: Hardly. Cordelia, my dear young lady, I’m afraid you’ve been terribly misinformed. And I can guess by whom.\nFLIP: Sil.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nCORDELIA: And now you presume to slander my guardian!\nFLIP: Your what?\nCORDELIA: It was Sil who sponsored me after my father’s execution. It was Sil who paid for the education that ensured I might live up to my father’s name!\nDOCTOR: I admit, my recall of those days is a little hazy, but whatever your father’s fate, he was not ‘executed’. And certainly not at my behest!\nCORDELIA: Oh, so your ‘recall of those days is a little hazy’? How convenient.\nFLIP: Gotta admit, Doctor, that does sound pretty weak.\nDOCTOR: As a matter of fact, my brain was somewhat scrambled after an intimate encounter with one of young Crozier’s mind-warping machines!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 52\nCORDELIA: A feeble pretence at amnesia. Oh, how I longed for you to answer Anzor’s distress call. Longed? I ached for it. Wherever my father is now, he will look down and rejoice at your being delivered to me.\nDOCTOR: I was removed from the scene by my own people, Ms Crozier. Whatever occurred afterwards, I wasn’t there!\nCORDELIA: Your people were simply protecting their own. In the chaos that followed their manipulation of the Laws of Time, they created a void. That was how my father died: sucked into a timeless absence, never to return!\nDOCTOR: I have only fragments of memory from that time. And I’1l have you know, Cordelia, that I, too, lost someone when the Time Lords intervened.\nFLIP: This ‘Peri’, right?\nDOCTOR: My companion, yes.\nFLIP: Sil said. What happened? She died, right?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. It’s — well, it’s complicated.\nFLIP: What kind of explanation is that?\nCORDELIA: Complicate things all you like, Doctor, I know the truth. You were the Time Lords’ agent. You owe me — and you’1l repay your debt by donating your body — and that of your ‘companion’ too — to the cause of scientific research!\nFLIP: Me? His ‘companion’? Nah. It’s just friends. Really.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 26: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nKRISTAL: Mr President? Am I to understand you knew about this alien creature’s monstrous scheme?\nBOSCOE: You must appreciate, Kristal; as President, I must be prepared to think the unthinkable when it comes to protecting our beloved Concorpia.\nKRISTAL: (LOST FOR WORDS) But how could — how could you even — [contemplate]\nSIL: Titan cholera can be introduced into the public water supply; rats can be infected with a bacterium christened the New Black Death.\nKRISTAL: That’s not what I meant.\nBOSCOE: Sil, how long before the various antigens become available?\nSIL: Soon, Mr President. We have very special individual assisting us. A non-human prepared to donate his body to science in the interest of reducing the cost of welfare benefits by ninety per cent. Grant me permission to proceed and I will allow Concorp a further loan on my own authority.\nBOSCOE: Shall we take a vote?\nSIL: (ROLLING EYES) Democracy!\nBOSCOE: Say ‘aye’ and I shall authorise Sil to expedite this most radical of solutions.\nBOSCOE: What is your decision? ‘Aye’ or ‘nay’? Speak!\nBOARD: MEMBERS [NOT KRISTAL]\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 54\nSIL: I can’t quite hear you.\nBOARD: MEMBERS [NOT KRISTAL] AYE!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 27: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nDOCTOR: Ms Crozier — Miss Jackson here is my assistant, a fellow human being not in any way involved with our mutual history, whatever that may be. Let her go.\nCORDELIA: How she responds to the viral bombardment, how soon she succumbs will be of value to the project.\nFLIP: Doctor, I don’t much fancy this. I know I said I wanted an adventure, but being some mad woman’s guinea pig comes way down the list.\nCORDELIA: You are the main prize, Doctor. As you do battle with the diseases that await you in the isolation chamber, my instruments will track the resistance your immune system summons up to resist the viral onslaught.\nFLIP: What sort of diseases do you mean? Cos I’m rubbish with a sniffle. One sneeze and I’m dead for a week.\nDOCTOR: I think Ms Crozier has more than the common cold in mind. They’re all lined up on the bench here, in vials. (READING) Cholerae Titanicum; a nasty little flavivirus from the Outer Galaxies; Yersinia pestis novus?! You are spoiling us.\nCORDELIA: They’re not what you think. Merely failed attempts at a panacea. Guards, keep him away from the samples.\nDOCTOR: Why? If these are failures, there’s no harm in picking up this tube of ‘New Black Death’ — (GRABS VIAL) — is there now?\nCORDELIA: Put that back, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But it wouldn’t matter if I did drop it, and smash it open on the floor — would it, Ms Crozier? Oh — except a failed antidote would contain something of the original disease, would it not?\nCORDELIA: It.. might. But you would be risking the life of your assistant.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 56\nDOCTOR: It'd be risking the life of your two security guards. Who will back off! — if they know what’s good for them, that is.\nCORDELIA: (TO GUARDS) You idiots, he’s bluffing!\nFLIP: I don’t think they’re so sure.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure they have no wish to inhale the fumes of the New Black Death, if they can possibly avoid it. Right, Flip, I suggest we\nDOCTOR: make ourselves rather scarce.\nFLIP: You mean like now?\nDOCTOR: Like now, absolutely.\nDOCTOR: THEY RUSH TO THE DOOR, PULL IT OPEN. AND SLAM IT AFTER THEM.\nCORDELIA: Cowards! Well, don’t just stand there — raise the alarm!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 28: INT. CONCORP — CORRIDOR/RAT ROOM\nFLIP: Where are we running to? We didn’t see the way in!\nDOCTOR: (TO STOP) Try a door, any door! (EFFORT, PUSHING ON DOOR) Shut tight. Oh, I wish I still had my sonic screwdriver...!\nFLIP: This one’s open —\nFLIP: SQUEAKS AND SQUEALS GREETS HER. SIMULTANEOUSLY, CLATTERING FOOTSTEPS AT FAR END OF CORRIDOR OFF.\nFLIP: Oh pants, it’s full of rats!\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t matter, guards approaching! Inside, quick!\nFLIP: (HISSED) Doctor, there’s hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: All in cages, nothing to worry about.\nFLIP: Easy for you to say. I can feel a phobia coming on. What are they here for?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. That said, rattus rattus was the primary carrier of the original Yersinia pestis...\nFLIP: They’re plague rats? You’re saying they’re plague rats?!

Now, Doctor, NOW!\nDOCTOR: All right, they’ve gone.\nFLIP: Go, go, go!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 29: INT. CONCORP — CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR\nDOCTOR WHO: FLIP AND THE DOCTOR HURRY TO STOP.\nDOCTOR: Is there no end to this corridor?! (A THOUGHT) Unless — don’t tell\nDOCTOR: me it’s circular...?!\nFLIP: It’s not circular.\nDOCTOR: Well, thank goodness for that.\nFLIP: I think it might be, actually. Look — sign for ‘LAB HUB’ ahead.\nDOCTOR: Well, why’d you say it wasn’t?\nFLIP: Duh, cos you told me not to?\nDOCTOR: Come on, we’d better go back the way we came.\nFLIP: Or we could just get in the lift.\nDOCTOR: What lift?\nFLIP: The one I just called. Obv.\nDOCTOR: Just get in...\nDOORS: CLOSE.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 30: INT. CONCORP — RECEPTION [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR WHO: NB: NO KLAXON NOW.\nAUTOMATED: VOICE G.F. One. Doors opening. Concorp thanks you for your work. Concorp where everyone matters.\nDOCTOR: Here we are, Reception. Nearly there, Flip. —\nFLIP: Yeah, but look at that lot. How many security guards does one evil headquarters need?\nSIL: (OFF) Ah, Doctor. Not planning on leaving us?\nFLIP: Oh, and look who it isn’t.\nSIL: Guards — arrest them, return them to the laboratory,!\nDOCTOR: Uh uh uh. I still have this little vial of New Black Death. I warn you all, it’s ever so fragile.\nSIL: (TO GUARDS) Pay him no heed, he’s bluffing! I know the Doctor of old, he’s revoltingly humane.\nFLIP: Not something you’d know much about, slug-features.\nDOCTOR: Should this glass break you’1ll all be dead in three days, along with half of the population of London. Imagine that — the streets piled waist-deep with corpses...\nSIL: You think I hire security guards for their imagination?!\nFLIP: He’s got a point, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 61\nDOCTOR: Pity, I was just hitting my stride.\nFLIP: (STEPPING FORWARD) You know what I think? I think slug-face here is just like them at the head office of Freshgoods.\nSIL: What is this ‘Freshgoods’?!\nFLIP: Supermarket where I used to work. Us lot on the checkouts, the only thing them at Freshgoods ever cared about us was how cheap our labour was. I bet Sil here’s the same. So ask yourselves — however little Sil, or Concorp, or whoever it is, is paying you — is it really worth the risk of dying? (BEAT AS THE GUARDS TAKE A\nSTEP: BACK) Thought not. Come on, Doctor, they’re letting us go.\nSIL: Don’t let them leave! You rabble, I’1l1 have you all demoted, you'll be living on scraps underground with the Bakerloonies!\nFLIP: Word to the wise, slugface. Next time, give your goons a raise.\nSIL: (SPLUTTERS WITH RAGE) A what?! — Stop them, he’s bluffing, bluffing!\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Sil.\nSIL: You'll be hunted down, Doctor. You’1ll be back in custody, we’1ll\nSIL: turn out the militia, you won’t escape.\nDOCTOR: (EXITING) We just have...\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 31: INT. WATERLOO STATION\nAUTOMATED: VOICE\nAUTOMATED: (OVER PA, IN B/G) The next train for all stations to Concorpia West is at Platform One. [Platform One for all stations to Concorpia West. All passengers for Sub-Europa and the ScandiState are reminded: radiation suits are mandatory. Repeat, mandatory. ]\nCERISE: (BECKONING) Pan! Pan! Any luck in the refuse stacks?\nPAN: No joy, Cerise. The Bakerloonies were all over the Business Class throwouts.\nCERISE: I begged a few bags of Concorp handouts. Snucky snacks, melty munches...\nPAN: Well, what good’s that filth?\nCERISE: Not for us, silly. To bait the traps, in the Underground?\nAUTOMATED: VOICE (OVER PA) All consumers, stand by for a public address from your President. Uploading.\nPAN: Boscoe himself? What’s he want, I wonder?\nBOSCOE: (OVER PA) Consumers and shareholders, I regret to inform you that dangerous agents are believed to be at large within the capital.\nBOSCOE: Agents in the pay of Concorpia’s rivals, trained to distort your\nBOSCOE: reason with insidious lies. The first is goes by the name of ‘The Doctor’; his companion is a young female designated ‘Flip’.\nCERISE: Pan! Aren’t they the ones who-?\nPAN: Yeah. Yeah, they are.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 63\nBOSCOE: Any sighting must be reported to the nearest control point. Anyone with information leading to their capture will be handsomely rewarded. Remember: Concorpia loves you.\nZOMBIE: CITIZENS (ON CONCOURSE; FLATLY, BY ROTE) And we love Concorpia.\nFLIP: Doctor, did you see that?\nDOCTOR: (SOFT MONOTONE) Of course I did. Try not to look so animated, Flip. Concentrate on fitting in with the crowd.\nFLIP: Oh, I get it. Slack jaw, dopey gaze...\nDOCTOR: Inane looks, vacant smiles.\nFLIP: How’s this face, too much?\nDOCTOR: Not quite enough, take your intelligence quotient down another ten points. That’s it, you now look like a member of the Concorpia sleeping class.\nFLIP: (DOPEY VOICE) Gee, thanks, Doc.\nCERISE: Pan! Look, heading to the sub-levels! That’s them!\nPAN: So it is. Catch up with them, Cerise. I’1ll meet you on the Southbound.\nCERISE: Well, where are you going?\nPAN: (LYING) I’m — going to scoop some rainwater. Must still be a few puddles about.\nCERISE: Just — watch out for the Marshals, yeah?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 64\nPAN: Don’t worry, I will. (WALKS OFF)\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 32: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nSIL: Incompetence, complete and utter, why was the plague vial on display within the Doctor’s reach?\nCORDELIA: It wasn’t on display, he recognised the name on the label as Yersinia Pestis and realised what it was.\nSIL: Thanks to you, Ms Crozier, he has escaped, taking his special immunities with him!\nCORDELIA: Then have Concorp’s goons return him to me. In a city full of zombies, he’ll stick out like the sorest of thumbs.\nSIL: He will be found. But if he is not, you will be made to suffer the consequences of your bungling!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 33: INT. TUBE PLATFORM\nCERISE: I’m sorry, Doctor, Flip. The traps are empty, I’ve no food to offer either of you.\nDOCTOR: Quite all right — Cerise, did you say?\nCERISE: Pan will be back soon, with water.\nFLIP: Just so long as it’s not that stuff you gave me before.\nCERISE: We didn’t realize. You said you were desperate, we just thought you were going through withdrawal.\nFLIP: Yeah, well — I wasn’t. I drank what you gave me and it was like all my critical faculties shut down, the world seemed just... fine.\nDOCTOR: (TO CERISE) When did you and Pan first realize the water was drugged?\nCERISE: I told you, I was a doctor. Six months ago, there was a fault in the pipeline. I was besieged by patients suffering the most terrible of symptoms. That was when I saw Concorpia as it really was. But when the health authorities discovered that Pan and I were gathering rainwater on the roof of the hospital...\nFLIP: What, they sacked you?\nCERISE: We had no choice but to join the Underground class. (BEAT) Getting cold, it must be past dark. I wonder what’s keeping Pan...?\nFLIP: I’m sure it’s nothing. Least we’ve got the fire to keep us toasty.\nDOCTOR: That reminds me. (PRODUCING VIAL FROM POCKET) A little fuel for the brazier.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 67\nCERISE: (READING LABEL) ‘Yersinia pestis novus’. Isn’t that...?\nDOCTOR: A very nasty little something, best made safe by incineration.\nPAN: (OFF) Cerise? Cerise, you there?\nCERISE: Pan! What kept you?\nPAN: (APPROACHING) Just business. You kept the enemy agents with you, good.\nFLIP: We’re not agents of anyone, we only want to help.\nPAN: That’s not what the Marshals say.\nCERISE: Since when did you care what the Marshals say — (REALISATION) Oh Pan. Pan, you haven’t —\nFLIP: Haven’t what?\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Stay where you are, all of you!\nPAN: Don’t stress, Cerise. It’s alright. I turned in the strangers.\nDOCTOR: How very kind.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Rival agents, raise your hands!\nFLIP: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just do as they say, Flip.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 68\nPAN: I’ve claimed the reward, Cerise. We’1ll be employed! No more eating rates. We’ll have our place in the Upper World again.\nCERISE: Pan, how could you-?\nPAN: I did it for us, Cerise.\nFLIP: For yourself, more like.\nDOCTOR: Don’t judge Pan too harshly, Flip. I can see clearly how this ‘Concorpia’ drives people to terrible extremes.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Citizens, Concorp is grateful for your assistance. You must accompany us to Concorp HQ, to claim your reward.\nFLIP: Yeah, thirty pieces of silver.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL I give you scum a clear choice. Walk with us or be rendered\nKNIGHT: unconscious. Which is it to be?\nDOCTOR: What do you think, Flip?\nFLIP: I say why walk when we can r—\nFLIP: ONE). FIRST FLIP, THEN THE DOCTOR, FLUMP TO FLOOR.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Predictable.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 34: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nCORDELIA: (APPROACHING) That was the Knight Marshal’s office, Sil. The Doctor and his whatever-she-is are being brought in.\nSIL: Then the experiment can begin. We will discover how and why Time Lords are always in the pink — won’t we, little Anzor?\nMINI: ANZOR Fiddlesticks! Fiddlesticks!\nCORDELIA: Put him back in his box, Sil. I don’t want him running around my lab.\nSIL: Poor little Anzor. No, don’t sulk, let me scratch you between your eye stalks, mm, you like that, don’t you? Now — let’s pop you back into your box, shall we? Let you have some sleepy-byes.\nMINI: ANZOR Fiddlesticks! Fiddle...\nSIL: I trust your next experiment is more successful than the last, Cordelia. I will be less than merciful should you fail me twice. You must succeed, my future prosperity depends on it!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 35: INT. CONCORP — PRESIDENTIAL APARTMENT\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL President Boscoe, sir?\nBOSCOE: What is it, Knight Marshal?\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL The, er, citizens who helped us apprehend the seditionists. You wanted to thank them personally?\nBOSCOE: I did, I did! Well, show them in.\nPAN: Mr President, I must apologise for our appearance. Everything’s so clean in here, but we’re in rags.\nBOSCOE: Pan, isn’t it? And you must be Cerise. Welcome to Concorp.\nCERISE: (QUIET) Mr President.\nBOSCOE: Don’t be shy, young lady. You’re one of us now. I have decided to grant you both the Concorpia order of merit. Your shining example of civic duty in helping us capture the Hang Seng agents deserves our fullest appreciation.\nPAN: Thank you, sir. (UNCERTAIN) May I... er...\nBOSCOE: Yes?\nCERISE: Pan wants a job, Mr President.\nBOSCOE: Oh! Well, I’m sure a suitable position can be found, now that you have proved your devotion to Concorp. But first — (MILD DISTASTE)\nBOSCOE: — let’s get you cleaned up, fed and watered. From our private supply, of course...\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 36: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nSIL: Ah, Doctor. How nice to see you and your seditious little friend Suitably restrained. I do hope the straps on your stretchers are uncomfortably tight.\nFLIP: (STRAPPED ONTO STRETCHER) The pins and needles are kicking in nicely, if that’s what you mean.\nCORDELIA: The isolation chamber is ready, Sil. Let’s get on with it, shall we?\nDOCTOR: (STRAPPED ONTO STRETCHER) Do what you must to me, Ms Crozier, but why should Flip suffer?\nSIL: Her disrespectful attitude to me is reason enough!\nDOCTOR: You can’t condemn her for a little youthful exuberance, Sil.\nFLIP: Yeah, were you never young?\nSIL: (SPLUTTERING) I am still young, you little-!\nFLIP: Oops. Sorry.\nSIL: Cordelia! Send them into the chamber of horrors!\nCORDELIA: Activating automatic stretchers.\nDOCTOR: CREEPING TOWARDS THE ISOLATION CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Hold tight, Flip, I’1ll see you on the other side.\nSIL: For her there will be no other side.\nCORDELIA: Sealing isolation chamber... now.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 72\nCORDELIA: All monitors registering.

Lovely to see them placed side by side, like mummies in a tomb. Why are their eyes closed?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 74\nCORDELIA: There is nothing for them to see, only total darkness. All the activity will take place inside their bodies, as the various bacteria and viral elements strive to overcome the antibodies alerted by their immune systems. That is already beginning to occur, see.\nSIL: Oh, I don’t understand all this instrumentation, wiggly lines, graphs and figures, lights that blink, things that go beep.\nCORDELIA: I thought figures were your strong suit.\nSIL: Only when they appear on a balance sheet. Why aren’t they showing Signs of stress and pain?\nCORDELIA: This is a controlled investigation of an alien immune system, not a Sideshow put on for your amusement.\nSIL: A little trauma, the odd burst of agony, is that too much to ask?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 38: INT.

I can’t see anything!\nDOCTOR: I’m right here, Flip. Try not to panic.\nFLIP: Tell me that’s not the best plan you’ve got?\nDOCTOR: As a matter of fact, I’m trying to place a field of protection around us by means of telepathic transference.\nFLIP: Will it protect me?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know if it even exists, but I once met a Saturnian swami who swore by it.\nFLIP: There’s things in here with us! — (FX: CLOSE BUZZ) — There! Did you hear that? Flies, or insects, or something.\nDOCTOR: It might be your imagination, literalising the microbial swarm.\nFLIP: I’m not making it up.

It’s as though something in there is absorbing the sound.\nSIL: Then call an engineer, your devices are faulty!\nCORDELIA: I’m not so sure. (THOUGHTFUL) There was something Anzor said...\nSIL: What, ‘Fiddlesticks’?\nCORDELIA: When he was first put in the chamber, before his transmogrification into your pocket pet, he claimed he’d felt something in there, on the psychic waveband. Some sort of intelligence.\nSIL: Pseudo-scientific rot!\nCORDELIA: That’s what I thought. Now, I’m not so certain.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 40: INT. CONCORP — ISOLATION CHAMBER\nVELENA: Phillipa. Phillipa...\nFLIP: Who’s that? Who’s there?\nDOCTOR: There’s no-one else, Flip. Only you and I.\nVELENA: Phillipa. Do not be alarmed. My name is Velena, I’m your friend.\nFLIP: Doctor, I can hear a voice.\nDOCTOR: Yes, mine.\nFLIP: I mean, a voice in my head. Hearing voices, that can’t be good, can it? — Doctor? Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Please, I am trying to focus my admittedly limited telepathic abilities.\nVELENA: Calm youself, Phillipa. Please, relax. What a lovely young body you have. So strong. So healthy. So very, very healthy...\nFLIP: It’s a woman’s voice. Her name is Velena, she’s my friend. She says I’m young, strong and healthy. So very, very healthy...\nVELENA: Sleep, Phillipa. (AN EDGE OF SOMETHING NASTY CREEPING IN) Sleep, and let... me... in!\nFLIP: (SLEEPILY) Sleep, yes. Sleep, and let you in...\nDOCTOR: ‘Sleep’? (URGENT) No! Flip! Wake up! Whatever the voice is, pay it no heed! It’s lulling you into a false sense of security, so it can take over your physical form with the minimum resistance.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 78\nFLIP: Seriousl]Ly...?\nDOCTOR: Before you know it, you’ll be colonised by some alien disease, and there'll be no way for you to stop the spread. You must fight her off!\nVELENA: Fanciful beyond measure. Now sleep, Flip. Sleep...\nFLIP: Shut it, freaky voice in my head. I don’t know who or what you\nFLIP: are, but one thing’s for sure, you’re no mate of mine!\nVELENA: Disappointing. I was hoping you’d prove... more receptive.\nFLIP: Doctor? I think the voice has gone. I’ve got rid of her, yes!\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Flip. I’m listening to the band.\nFLIP: The what-?\nFLIP: MARCH, SLOW DRUMMING, APPROACHING.\nDOCTOR: The band, Flip. Can’t you hear them, marching into battle...?\nFLIP: (FADING) There’s no band, Doctor. Doctor, they’re attacking you now! Doctor!!!\nVODA: Halt!\nDOCTOR: And who might you be? You and your pestilential army?\nDOCTOR: THE MALE VOICE THAT ENTERS THE DOCTORS MIND IS BRISK, DEEP AND SONOROUS WITH ALIEN OVERTONES.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 79\nVODA: Doctor. I am Voda, Great Chief of the Velendari.\nDOCTOR: Is that so?\nVODA: We are about to engage in mighty battle, you and I. You seem to possess unusually strong fortifications but I have many battalions to send against you.\nDOCTOR: Is this to be an entirely metaphysical exchange?\nVODA: Sooner or later the walls of your immunity will be breached.\nDOCTOR: Don’t count on that, Chief.\nVODA: I can lose billions and still call billions more to the attack.\nDOCTOR: Bully for you.\nVODA: You doubt that I can summon such an army?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. There are an awful lot of bugs out there in the microbial universe. Unsurprising, really, that one or two should have developed some sort of binding intelligence.\nVODA: We are multitudes. We are unstoppable. But, nevertheless, I wish to offer you a truce.\nDOCTOR: How kind. May I ask on what terms?\nVODA: Our intelligence grows impatient to leave the confines of the microbial world and occupy the living spaces beyond. To do so we need a point of entry; you. Submit your consciousness to me, and your physical life will be spared.\nDOCTOR: Psychic bacteria, now I’ve heard everything. Tell me, Voda, once you have achieved the transition you seek, what will you do then?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 80\nVODA: We will transmit ourselves into the minds of a select group of humans. For us it will a giant step in our evolutionary journey.\nDOCTOR: What will you do then, build, create, write books, plays, compose symphonies?\nVODA: What?\nDOCTOR: What will be your aim, your goal?\nVODA: Why, to occupy, to conquer, to put an end to the human experiment.\nDOCTOR: What — destroy them utterly?\nVODA: A few will remain, as nurseries for our young.\nDOCTOR: In which case — I don’t believe I can help you, Voda. I think it’s best if you and all your microbial chums remain where you are, in the physical realm.\nVODA: Then we shall take your mind by force! Prepare yourself for oblivion!\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Oh, I’m always prepared for that. Flip? Flip!\nFLIP: Doctor? You back in the room? What’s going on?\nFLIP: AND STRONGER AS IF A SWARM OF LOCUSTS WERE GATHERING.\nDOCTOR: We are about to suffer a massive onslaught from the legions of the Velendari.\nFLIP: They’re like, what? Microbes?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 81\nDOCTOR: Microbes with ideas well above their station, yes. Our immune systems may yet be able to fight them off —\nFLIP: Mine won’t! Can’t even remember when I last had a tetanus jab!\nTARDIS: travel will have given you some additional protection. Another of Rassilon’s gifts.\nFLIP: Plus I bunked off school the day everyone else had the B.C.G.!\nDOCTOR: Flip, listen! It’s imperative that whatever physical effects you experience, do not give in to the mental attack! — Now, gather\nDOCTOR: your strength. They’re coming. (TO SELF) All right, Voda, let the conflict commence.\nVODA: Forward, my army, forward! Ch-a-a-arge!!!\nVODA: OF BATTLE — AS AN ARMY CHARGING ON A MEDIAEVAL CASTLE. CLASH OF WEAPONRY, SCREAMS, CRIES OF THE DYING, AS THE DOCTOR AND FLIP’S\nANTIBODIES: SEEK TO REPEL AND DESTROY THE INVADING HORDES.\nANTIBODIES: FADE.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 41: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nDOUBLE: HEARTBEAT.\nCORDELIA: Look at the Doctor’s physical signs. Things are happening in there. He’s starting to succumb.\nSIL: Succumb to what?\nCORDELIA: The New Black Death...\nSIL: Excellent!\nCORDELIA: . plus Titan cholera, Creeping moon fever, Lasarti’s Wasting, lavapox and the Darkspace Plague.\nSIL: Lovely.\nCORDELIA: Now the readings are fading. They’re going to die, both of them.\nSIL: But where is the Doctor’s resistance? What use is this experiment if the Doctor dies without giving us what we want?

The battle is over, we are victorious. Weakened but still inviolable.\nFLIP: I’ve got the king and queen of all hangovers. Headache, dry mouth, (HUFFS AND SNIFFS) minging breath, urgh...\nDOCTOR: But you’re alive, that’s all that matters.\nFLIP: I heard that witch Velena’s voice amongst all that noise. She was still trying to sneak past my defences - then I lost her.\nDOCTOR: The Velendari are banished, for the time being at least.\nFLIP: After surviving this lot, I’1ll never worry about catching ‘flu again.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 43: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nSIL: They have survived?\nCORDELIA: The readings suggest that the girl almost succumbed; but that the Doctor’s immunities somehow protected her. Sil, do you see what this means?\nSIL: That this Flipper creature has the luck of the Great Morgo himself!\nCORDELIA: That the Doctor’s immunities are transmissible! From the data I’ve recorded it should be possible to construct a model of his resistance, and turn that into a panacea against all these alien diseases!\nSIL: Then I offer you my congratulations, Ms Crozier. You are your father’s daughter. (BEAT) Let’s have no devil hands for idle work, press on, press on!\nI CORDELIA: I The, Doctor and his friend need time to recover their strength.\nI SIL: I What does that matter,? They have served their purpose.\nI CORDELIA: I Not quite. I will need the Doctor for further tests, (THOUGHTFUL) I also want to question him about jis experience ,inside the chamber, to see if it tallies with Anzor’s account.\nI CORDELIA: I SIL. (DISMISSIVE) Chasing psychic phenomena! Where’s the profit in I that?, All I want to see ,is the look on the Doctor’s face when he, I realises that he has been ,responsible for my Mentorship being I rated most bonus worthy! ,(GURGLES WITH PLEASURE),\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 44: INT. PAN & CERISE’S APARTMENT\nPAN: (WALKING IN) This is it, Cerise. An apartment of our own! Three rooms, kitchen, a bathroom. Fully furnished, everything fresh and new!\nCERISE: Access to the executive water supply, too? So we won’t be drinking in placatory drugs, designed to keep us content?\nPAN: We’re out of that world, now.\nCERISE: What about the millions who remain there, Pan?\nPAN: They’d change places with us given a chance.\nCERISE: Everyone should have that chance.\nPAN: Cerise, stop this. I’m going to try the shower — no more waiting in line for the communal bath house for us. Join me? We need to be looking our best for the President’s presentation. We’re going to be on the public vid, you know!\nPAN: CERISE. We can take all the showers we like, we’ll never be clean inside.\nPAN: You must stop this... These feelings of guilt... We’ll be given work to do — paid work, useful work. You might even get your old job back.\nCERISE: If I’m a good girl. If I do what Concorp say.\nPAN: Concorp look after their own.\nCERISE: They also own us.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 45: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nPRESSURE: IS RELEASED, STRETCHERS BEARING THE DOCTOR AND FLIP SLIDE OUT OF THE CHAMBER TOWARDS CORDELIA AND SIL.\nSIL: Ah, hello, Doctor, Did you enjoy your time in splendid isolation in Cordelia’s chamber of horrors? No ill-effects, I trust?\nDOCTOR: Reseal the chamber, Ms Crozier. Do it now!\nCORDELIA: It is done.\nFLIP: Any chance you could release these straps? I’ve got dead arms, dead legs, dead everything.\nSIL: If only that were true.\nDOCTOR: Cordelia, are Flip and I clean? Because if so much as a single microbe should get out of that isolation chamber...\nFLIP: Yeah, a right Pandora’s Box you’ve got there.\nCORDELIA: I’ve run three whole sterilisation cycles. You’ve no need to fear.\nFLIP: That’s you again, Sil. What is it this time? Greengrocers got some fresh lettuce in, for you to crawl over?\nSIL: (CHECKING COMMS UNIT) I have a call scheduled with the great Lord Mav, on Thoros Beta. Cordelia, I must depart. Can I trust you not to let these creatures out while I’m away?\nCORDELIA: Don’t worry, they won’t be going anywhere.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 46: INT. CONCORP — TV STUDIO\nBOSCOE: IS ADDRESSING THE NATION.\nFLOOR: ASSISTANT (SLIGHTLY OFF) Ready, Mr President? Going to air in three, two, one —\nFLOOR: A BIT ‘LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY’ UNDER BOSCOE’S SPEECH.\nBOSCOE: My fellow citizens. I would be failing in my duty to this great nation of Concorpia were I not to warn you that there are those amongst us who seek to disrupt and subvert the workings of our great society. Fortunately, there are heroes among us — and today, it is my privilege to introduce to you two of them, whose brave and selfless actions helped our Knights Marshal capture two ruthless agents of rival powers, including that underground leader known only as the Doctor. Step forward, Pan Connell and Cerise Davies.\nPAN: Mr President.\nBOSCOE: It is with great pleasure that I confer upon you both the insignia of the Knights of Concordia. As newly promoted Citizens of the Executive Class, wear this honour with pride and humility.\nPAN: We will, Mr President, thank you. (HISSED) Cerise-!\nCERISE: (FLAT) Yes. Thank you.\nBOSCOE: Once again, our sincere gratitude for your actions in defending the interests of us all. My fellow citizens, thank you for listening to your President, I wish you good night. And remember: Concorp cares.\nFLOOR: ASSISTANT Relax, studio, it’s a wrap.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 47: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nCORDELIA: Doctor, Miss Jackson — I shall need to release you both in order to run you through a further round of decontamination.\nDOCTOR: Belt and braces, eh, Ms Crozier? Very wise.\nCORDELIA: Be aware that this lab hub is in lockdown, and that the guards outside have been issued with biohazard suits. So there’s little point in trying to bluff your way out of here again.\nDOCTOR: Flip? How are you feeling?\nFLIP: Bit unsteady on me feet.\nDOCTOR: Only to be expected.\nFLIP: You’re sure I’ve not got any lurgies or anything?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think I deflected the attentions of your friend Velena.\nCORDELIA: Velena?\nDOCTOR: One of several intelligent viral entities we encountered inside the chamber. (BEAT) Forgive me, you don’t seem completely surprised.\nCORDELIA: No. Continue.\nDOCTOR: They call themselves the Velendari. They’d like very much to infect human minds, not just their bodies. Whether they existed all along, or have come into being as a result of your experimentation, I cannot say.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 89\nCORDELIA: More likely they were figments of your hallucination.\nFLIP: They were real all right. Velena spoke to me. A right schmoozer she was.\nDOCTOR: I met a warrior chief called Voda. Ms Crozier, I beg you: destroy every last one of your samples. Close down this ‘project’ of yours.\nCORDELIA: Doctor, if I didn’t know of your history, I might be intrigued enough to investigate further, but I know you to be a cheat whose every word must be doubted.\nDOCTOR: Every word?\nCORDELIA: Every one. You are almost superfluous to my requirements as far as this project is concerned. I have the data as to how you combat disease, and only require a few more samples to complete the formula that will allow the creation of the perfect antidote.\nDOCTOR: Antidote to what, for what?\nCORDELIA: That need not concern you. You will have served our purpose.\nDOCTOR: The New Black Death isn’t even active in this galaxy. And Titan is hardly a popular tourist destination. Why are you so desperate to conquer such exotic diseases, when altogether more mundane afflictions, such as influenza, surely pose a more urgent threat?\nCORDELIA: (MOCKING) Are you quite sure about that, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You’re planning an outbreak, aren’t you? You and Sil. You’re going to let these diseases out!\nFLIP: That’s totally insane.\nDOCTOR: But it makes financial sense. You forget who Ms Crozier’s in cahoots with. That’s Sil’s interest, don’t you see? Patent the treatment, release the disease — they’1l make billions! Trillions!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 90\nCORDELIA: Oh, Doctor. You couldn’t be more wrong.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 48: INT. CONCORP — COMMS CENTRE\nBOB: KEEPS TRYING TO RESTORE CONTACT.\nSIL: Why this endless delay?! Connect me to Lord Mav at once!!!\nBOB: I’m trying. Bane of my life, Thoros Beta. Thoros Alpha distorts the frequency, see. Sun spots don’t help.\nBOSCOE: (APPROACHING WITH PAN AND CERISE) .. ah, now, here’s someone I must introduce you to. Sil. — Sil! Is something the matter?\nSIL: My patience is at an absolute end, Mr President, this dolt cannot raise my home planet for me to make my report and try for further funds.\nBOSCOE: I’m sure Bob is doing his very best.\nSIL: Who are these persons with you?\nBOSCOE: I was just giving these two newly instated Executive Class citizens a tour of the Communications Floor. Pan and Cerise, this is Sil — one of our business partners...\nCERISE: Partners? But he’s an — [alien]\nBOSCOE: . a member of Concorp’s Board, yes.\nSIL: Aren’t you the people who betrayed the whereabouts of the Doctor?\nPAN: We are, sir.\nSIL: Then my congratulations on putting your own interests first.\nBOB: (CYNICAL) The heroes of the month, eh?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 92\nSIL: Get on with your work, you, you... functionary!\nBOSCOE: Pan is to work on restoring narcoplaxamine to the public water supply. He has been awarded the post of shift supervisor.\nPAN: I really am very grateful. Concorp loves me.\nSIL: And you? The female? Do you have any skills?\nCERISE: I was a doctor, once.\nSIL: (INTERESTED) A doctor? Really? We must find you something... productive to do.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 49: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nDOCTOR: You're a fool to believe this association with Sil will bring you any kind of fortune, Ms Crozier. There’ll be a catch. Something in the small print. There always is!\nCORDELIA: I have no contract with Sil.\nVELENA: (FAINT, IN FLIP’S HEAD) Phillipa...\nFLIP: (TO SELF) What?\nDOCTOR: Don’t tell me all you’ve got is some kind of gentleman’s agreement? That’s even worse!\nVELENA: (LOUDER, IN FLIP’S HEAD) Oh, Phillipa...\nFLIP: (GRITTED TEETH) Shut up, will you?!\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nCORDELIA: Doctor, my interest here is purely personal —\nDOCTOR: Ssh, ssh, ssh. Flip? Is something the matter?\nFLIP: I can hear her, Doctor. Velena. She’s come back. She wants me to —\nVELENA: (LOUDER STILL, IN FLIP’S HEAD) ... Sleeeeeeeeep.\nFLIP: Doctor, I — oh...\nMEDICAL: INSTRUMENTS AWRY — CLATTERING ETC.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 94\nDOCTOR: (ALARMED) Flip? Flip!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 50: INT. CONCORP — COMMS CENTRE\nBOB: Here we go. Signal’s coming through.\nSIL: At last!\nMAV: (D, OVER SCREEN) Sil, where have you been, what news, are you there?\nSIL: Master Mav, it is I, Sil, the line was broken up by sun spots, galactic storms and frequency interruptus.\nMAV: (D) Sil, spare me the inter-galactic weather report. Have you imposed the restrictions on Concorpia the U.M.F. demands?\nSIL: They are almost in place.\nMAV: (D) Almost? What is this ‘almost’?\nSIL: I can promise a forty-five per cent reduction of their welfare budget in one weeks’ time, followed by a further forty-five per cent the week after.\nMAV: (D) Forty-five..? Sil, these figures can only be fantasy!\nSIL: President Boscoe is with me, he will confirm all I say.\nBOSCOE: The figures Sil quoted are indeed correct, sir, according to our latest projections.\nMAV: (D) But won’t such a radical reduction cause civil unrest, revolution, anarchy?\nBOSCOE: No, we have already made plans for a security clampdown. All precautions will be in place.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 96\nSIL: The U.M.F. loan and its payback profits will be safe.\nMAV: (D) Do you know what you are doing, Sil? I recall that you have failed on several previous missions.\nSIL: Not this time, Master, I promise.\nMAV: (D) Then you had better attain these targets, or you will be recalled and re-assigned to the deserts of outer Segoria!\nSIL: Please, Master, let’s not be too hasty —\nBOB: He’s gone, mate. Anything else I can do for either of you, gents?\nBOSCOE: No, thank you, Bob, that will be all.\nBOB: (GETTING UP) Good. Might just catch the canteen.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 51: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nFLIP: (DROWSY) Doctor, I feel so sleepy, I feel as if I could sleep forever.\nDOCTOR: (ALARM) No, Flip, no. Stay awake, you must stay awake, do you hear me? — Cordelia, help me get her up on the couch.\nCORDELIA: After three. One, two, three — (EFFORT)\nFLIP: Is it me, or is it getting dark in here? Will they let the rats in?\nDOCTOR: We'll be back into the light, very soon.\nFLIP: No rats.\nDOCTOR: None at all.\nCORDELIA: Her temperature is on an upward gradient; dangerously so.\nDOCTOR: We must bring it down.\nCORDELIA: I can do that.\nDOCTOR: Then do it.\nCORDELIA: If you agree to assist me in my work.\nFLIP: Can’t do that, Doctor. Can’t help Sil...\nDOCTOR: Save her, help her recover and I will show you where you went wrong with Anzor. Time Lord immunobiology is a complicated business.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 98\nCORDELIA: But you will help me refine the antigen?\nFLIP: No!\nDOCTOR: Yes!\nCORDELIA: Very well. I will inject her with a prime antibiotic, it’s one of the few that remain potent. Hold her arm... (INJECTS)\nFLIP: Ow!\nCORDELIA: She still feels pain, that’s a good sign.\nFLIP: (FEVERISH, DELIRIOUS) Great, whoopy-doo, pain, take me to the threshold, take me to meet...\nVELENA: (IN FLIP’S HEAD) Sleep.\nFLIP: Velena! Hi, how are you? I can hear her, Doctor, she’s talking to me, the witch, Velena....\nDOCTOR: Don’t listen to her Flip, send her away.\nFLIP: She wants to be my best mate. Shut up, will you? Get lost, get lost, GET LOST!!\nCORDELIA: Shall I sedate her?\nDOCTOR: No, she needs to resist; my only hope is that she is re-living a memory and not experiencing reality.\nCORDELIA: What reality?\nDOCTOR: That she is being over-run by the Velendari.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 52: INT. PAN & CERISE’S APARTMENT\nPAN: (OVER NOISE) This is the second shower you’ve taken today; is it still such a novelty? Cerise?\nCERISE: Pass me that towel.\nPAN: Why turn away from me, what is it?\nCERISE: I was in need of a shower after being paraded around like a pair of prize penguins, all scrubbed up, dressed in our new white uniforms and black jackets, that stupid insignia draped around our necks like fancy dog collars.\nPAN: Penguins wearing dog collars?\nCERISE: You know what I mean. I have to hurry. I have to report for duty at this Laboratory Hub.\nPAN: You’re still angry with me, aren’t you?\nCERISE: You betrayed the Doctor and Flip.\nPAN: Someone else would have turned them in.\nCERISE: . so why not us? I thought I knew you, Pan, now you seem like another person, a stranger.\nPAN: I have a job, forty thousand a month, forty thousand. Enough for us to buy into a protected area, to live safe and free.\nCERISE: Free? Stop, please, just, just, stop.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 100\nPAN: It was your dream for us to be able to afford children, now we can.\nCERISE: Why does this all feel so wrong? That green slug of an alien as good as patted our heads, congratulated us for thinking only of ourselves. Who is he? What is he?\nPAN: Sil is a Mentor, an agent of the U.M.F., he advises the President on all things financial.\nCERISE: Why was he so keen to give me a job?\nPAN: I don’t know. This is a strange new world.\nCERISE: It frightens me.\nPAN: I know.\nCERISE: Hold me.\nCERISE: HE TAKES HER TO HIM.\nPAN: We'll be fine. New beginnings are always scary. This is our new beginning.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 53: INT. CONCORP — ISOLATION CHAMBER\nFLIP: (FEVERISH) She’s still here, Doctor. Velena, I mean. She won’t stop — (CONVULSES) uurgh!\nDOCTOR: Flip? Flip!!!\nEFFECTED: DIALOGUE?\nEFFECTED: FLIP/VELENA Hello, Doctor.\nCORDELIA: That voice. What-?\nDOCTOR: The voice of the Velendari. I told you they were real!\nDOCTOR: FLIP/VELENA Doctor, I am now at one with the consciousness of your companion. I am ready to colonise her, to infect her completely.\nCORDELIA: But the girl was decontaminated. Sterilised!\nCORDELIA: FLIP/VELENA I possess this child. All I have to do is think her diseased, and it will be so!\nDOCTOR: What good will that do you? If Flip dies, you’ve lost your host.\nDOCTOR: FLIP/VELENA And if you want her to live, you will help me gain access to your world!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 54: INT. CONCORP — CORRIDOR\nSIL: This ‘security clampdown’ you promised Lord Mav. Do you have enough pacification substances to control the mob?\nBOSCOE: We could... but the price being asked by Mistress Na is astronomical.\nSIL: Pay it, I will authorise it. We must keep every one happy-happy until the diseases can do their work.\nBOSCOE: How soon will the antigens be ready?\nSIL: Soon, Mr President, soon. I am on my way to Miss Cordelia, to put a bit of stick about. Rest assured, I have no intention of being exiled to the sandy wastes of Outer Segoria. Uhrrrr!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 55: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nFLIP: So tired, Doctor...\nCORDELIA: The fever is abating. It seems that voice has gone away.\nFLIP: Yeah, I told her to get lost.\nDOCTOR: So you did.\nCORDELIA: The anti-viral treatment seems to be having an effect.\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope so...\nSIL: Cordelia! I demand proof of your progress!\nCORDELIA: Oh, no. — (CROSSING TO SIL) Sil, this laboratory is in lockdown. I demand you vacate these premises immediately.\nSIL: I come and go as I please! — (SUSPICIOUS) Lockdown? Why?\nCERISE: (STEPPING FORWARD) The girl, Flip. Can’t you see? She’s seriously a a is\nSIL: Is she? Oh good. (TO BEARERS) Lower me, gently down so I can witness the female on her sick bed.\nDOCTOR: Cerise? What are you doing with Sil?\nSIL: (REMEMBERING) Oh, yes. — Doctor, say hello to the one of the persons who sold you down the river, or should that be up the tunnel? (LAUGHS)\nCERISE: It wasn’t like that.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 104\nSIL: But see what it has brought you, a job with Ms Cordelia Crozier.\nCORDELIA: What? — I don’t need an assistant.\nSIL: I think you do. When will the antidote be perfected? Our plans are in place to introduce the cleansing agents into the general population.\nDOCTOR: ‘Cleansing agents’?\nCORDELIA: I still have final tests to do. The serum must be fully proven.\nSIL: You need only provide enough for a fraction of the populace.\nDOCTOR: Is that what you’re planning here? Introduce a smorgasbord of alien diseases into the environment, causing millions to perish, so only those who can pay for your patent medicine survive? Even by your standards, Sil, this is despicable!\nSIL: Doctor, you seem to imagine I’m some profiteering monster. No, no, no. I am here as a troubleshooter, assisting Concorp’s President at a moment of great hardship. Difficult times call for difficult solutions, and the Gen Pop simply must be reduced by a minimum of ninety per cent, for their own good!\nDOCTOR: You’re proposing genocide-?!\nSIL: We must have the vaccine tomorrow, at the very latest!\nCORDELIA: There is still a chain of anti-bodies to collate. The Doctor has agreed to assist me in their production in return for the life of his companion.\nFLIP: No, Doctor, I told you not to...too-00-00..atishoo!\nDOCTOR: Flip...?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 105\nSIL: What is the matter with this feminine creature?\nCERISE: Look, there, on her forehead...\nCORDELIA: A rose coloured ring.\nDOCTOR: I was afraid of this.\nSIL: Afraid of what?\nDOCTOR: What has just appeared is the first visible sign of infection by the New Black Death!\nDOCTOR: FLIP/VELENA\nDOCTOR: (POSSESSED AGAIN, SINGING) Ring-a- ring a roses, a pocket full of posies, atishoo, atishoo, we all fall DOWN!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 106"

I must prepare some more.\nDOCTOR: No time for that, is this sample a vaccine based on my DNA?\nCORDELIA: Infused with that of the girl’s. Why won’t it work, the formulaic projection and resultant equation should perform better than this?\nDOCTOR: Programme the next chain differently, take out all but five percent of the human DNA, project the rest from my immunity data.\nCORDELIA: If you say so.\nCORDELIA: SYSTEM.\nDOCTOR: Carefully! The nuclei of Gallifreyan antibodies are symbiotic, no wonder nothing’s working if you’re going to start chopping into them like a Smithfields butcher.

You really believe this vaccine will cure the New Black Death?\nDOCTOR: The New Black Death’s the easy bit. If I’m right, this will also banish the Velendari from Flip’s physiology.\nCORDELIA: Very well. I will prepare a sample dosage, but you must be the one to administer it.\nDOCTOR: Come, now — surely you’re better qualified?\nCORDELIA: Undoubtedly.

Stop twitching.\nDOCTOR: Still in their cages, I wonder if they’ve been infected yet.\nFLIP: I want out of here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t object to that either.\nDOCTOR: HE WANDERS TOWARDS THE WINDOWS.\nDOCTOR: Mmm. We must be about eight or nine stories up from the ground, on the east side of the Concorp tower; windows sealed, a guard outside the door, caged rats all around.\nFLIP: It’s hopeless, we’re trapped.\nDOCTOR: For the moment.

You know, about her father, and you being... I dunno, implicated?\nFLIP: What? What is it, Doctor? What’s the matter?\nDOCTOR: I wish I could be sure. I remember meeting Crozier on the planet Thoros-beta with my companion, Peri. But then there was a serious disruption of the flow of time, engineered under orders of the High Council of Time Lords. At first, I believed Peri to have been killed, but as it transpired... well, that was only one of several possibilities.\nFLIP: Sounds like a right mess-up.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. As regards exactly what happened to Cordelia’s father... I simply have no idea. As I explained, my memory of those events is somewhat compromised.\nFLIP: So what really happened to this... Peri? Do you know?\nDOCTOR: I thought I did. After the last few days... I’m wondering if I shouldn’t find out for sure. I have to admit... It is something that plays on my mind. And, I do miss her — Flip, are you listening to me?\nFLIP: Sorry, it’s just I don’t like the way that big black rat keeps looking at me; rubbing its paws; coiling its tail; what do you think I am, mate, dinner?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 63: INT. PAN & CERISE’S APARTMENT\nCERISE: Cordelia called the guards, they marched the Doctor and Flip away.\nPAN: Cerise...\nCERISE: Discarded them. I followed them to what’s called the rat room. There are hundreds of the things in there waiting to be infected with horrible diseases.\nPAN: This has nothing... [to do with us]\nCERISE: It has. Betraying the Doctor helped you become what you are now.\nPAN: How else would I gain such a trusted position with the water board? They were a means to an end.\nCERISE: Listen to yourself — ‘a means to an end’. What’s happened to you, Pan?\nPAN: It’s the way the world is.\nCERISE: Not my world.\nPAN: Your world no longer exists. There’s surplus population — I’m sorry, but there is. Despite bromidal additives, the plebeians still ignore the zero birth restriction order.\nCERISE: We didn’t ignore that law.\nPAN: We are no longer duty bound to obey. As members of the Executive Class we will be allowed two children.\nCERISE: In return for you drugging the population into total apathy.\nPAN: I do what is necessary to avert anarchy.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin\nCERISE: Anarchy?\nPAN: Why aren’t you happy, Cerise? We have everything, now.\nCERISE: Everything except our love for each other.\nPAN: What are you saying?\nCERISE: Simply this; I don’t respect, love or even recognise the you have become. From now on... keep away from me.\nCERISE: Page 121\nCERISE: person\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 64: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nSIL: My fellow Board members — I am delighted to inform you that the project will be instigated within days. Final safeguards are being completed as I speak. Then, as soon as sufficient amounts of vaccine are available to protect the Executive Class, the public downsizing down can begin.\nKRISTAL: And how is this ‘downsizing’ to be done? Mr President?\nBOSCOE: Initially, by introduction of cleansing elements into the public water supply.\nSIL: Together with extensive... ‘rat-ification’ within the Underground system. (GIGGLES) We should see a significant reduction of those other parasitical elements within days.\nKRISTAL: What of the public services? There will be bodies littering the streets once the epidemic takes hold.\nBOSCOE: Incineration units will be in place, burial pits will be prepared. I do not pretend it will be pretty. But fear not, Kristal: the vaccine works. I am told it is so powerful it has already brought a young woman suffering the effects of a deadly disease back from the dead.\nKRISTAL: That’s not what I’m afraid of.\nBOSCOE: What are you afraid of, Kristal?\nKRISTAL: The loss of our humanity.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 65: INT. CONCORP — LABORATORY\nAUTOMATED: VOICE Formula stability confirmed.\nCORDELIA: That’s it, then. Our work is almost done.\nCERISE: They’re really going to release the plagues?\nCORDELIA: That is not our concern, Cerise.\nCERISE: Not our concern, how can you say that?\nCORDELIA: What’s the matter, do you not wish to be employed? I would remind you that the vaccine will only be issued to the Executive Class. — Now, I have other business to attend to. Go and inform the Knight Marshal that I wish to have the prisoners brought to me.\nCERISE: The Doctor and Miss Jackson? Why?\nCORDELIA: There was another Time Lord here before. Anzor. He came to suffer an accidental transmogrification. I’m afraid a similar ‘accident’ is about to befall the Doctor and his companion. Soon they will look like creatures dredged up from the ocean floor; bulbous eyes, gaping jaws, waving fronds for feet.\nCERISE: The Doctor, you hate him that much?\nCORDELIA: He destroyed my father — his work, his reputation, his life. It is time for the Doctor to settle his debt.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 66: INT. CONCORP — RAT ROOM\nFLIP: We’ve got to get out of here.\nDOCTOR: We will.\nFLIP: How? I asked, how, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I know you did. That remains something of a conundrum.\nFLIP: I’m alive but, because of that, millions are going to die.\nDOCTOR: Yes, our genocidal friends in the Executive Class too.\nFLIP: How’d’you mean?\nDOCTOR: I believe Ms Crozier’s collection of diseases is itself infected, infiltrated by these Velendari.\nFLIP: I thought Velena was gone?\nDOCTOR: Successfully banished from your consciousness, yes. But these Velendari are multitudes, that’s what Voda said. I can’t imagine they won’t be able to mutate — and when they do, any ‘antidote’ will soon be useless. Humankind will be defenceless against the viral horde.\nFLIP: The Velendari will rule...\nDOCTOR: Someone’s coming.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 125\nCERISE: (TO GUARD) Knight Marshal, remain outside.\nFLIP: Cerise!\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Can’t do that, Ma’am.\nCERISE: I wish to interrogate the prisoners, wait outside.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Can’t do that.\nDOCTOR: Um, I hate to be alarmist, Knight Marshal, but I think you ought to know...\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL What?\nDOCTOR: There’s a rat crawling up your leg.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL (PANICKING) I hate those things — where-?\nFLIP: Whack him, Cerise-!\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL Get off me, woman!\nCERISE: (STRUGGLING) Flip, grab his gun!\nFLIP: Already on it. All right, you — back slowly into the rat room.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL (BACKING INTO ROOM) I mean it, I hate those things. It’s the eyes, the way they look at you.\nDOCTOR: Who’re you more afraid of? Miss Jackson, a desperate seditionary with a gun? Or a few big mice?\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL I hate mice too. Please, don’t leave [me]\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 126\nFLIP: The big wuss.\nCERISE: Quickly, take this keycard. My apartment is in the habitation annexe, third floor, room one-eight-two. There are exit passes in a kitchen drawer. It’s the only way out of this Tower.\nFLIP: Hang about, why are you helping us, anyway? Thought you’d thrown in your lot with Concorp.\nCERISE: Cordelia means to transmogrify you, the way she did the other Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: What about you?\nCERISE: I’1l say I was forced to release you. Hurry!\nDOCTOR: The Knight Marshal will tell a different story. Come with us, we'll find a way to get you out of here too.\nCERISE: I’m... I’m not sure, I--\nFLIP: Oh don’t be stupid, Cerise, come on!\nCERISE: All right! I will.\nDOCTOR: Come on, then!\nDOCTOR: ON THE DOOR AND YELLS FROM INSIDE.\nKNIGHT: MARSHAL They won’t stop looking at me. Let me out of here, somebody,\nKNIGHT: anybody, please!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 127 Scene 67: INT. PAN & CERISE’S APARTMENT\nFLIP: Thas’ 1s rt? Tt’s a bit titchy, ain't. 1t?\nCERISE: (BITTERLY) Home sweet home. In, both of you.\nDOCTOR: Kitchen drawer, did you say?\nCERISE: Third one down.\nPAN: (CALLS FROM OFF) Cerise? Is that you-?\nPAN: Cerise, we have to talk — (REALISATION) What are these two doing here?\nDOCTOR: Hello, Pan.\nCERISE: You’re home early.\nPAN: I told them I was ill. I wanted to talk to you, to try and work\nPAN: things out.\nFLIP: Looks like it’s worked out pretty well for you. Aww, look, you've even get your own name badge. ‘Water Enhancement Services’, what’s\nFLIP: that?\nCERISE: It means, he pours sedative drugs into the public water supply on\nCERISE: a daily basis.\nFLIP: Nice.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 128\nPAN: You don’t understand. I do my job.\nFLIP: I understand all right. Loser.\nCERISE: Flip, give me the Knight Marshal’s gun. (AS FLIP DOES SO) Doctor,\nCERISE: pick up those exit passes.\nPAN: You’re not helping them escape!\nCERISE: Back off, Pan. Doctor, get those passes!\nDOCTOR: Passes got. Cerise, we don’t need the gun.\nPAN: (STEPPING FORWARD) You won’t shoot me, Cerise. I know you won’t —\nFLIP: Cerise? You just —\nCERISE: It’s set to ‘stun’, he’1ll come round in a few minutes. Go, the pair of you! I’ll stay here, make sure he doesn’t raise the alarm.\nDOCTOR: I understand. Thank you, Cerise.\nFLIP: Will you be all right?\nCERISE: What do you think? — Please, just go!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 68: INT. CONCORP — ELEVATOR/RECEPTION\nFLIP: We’re not just running away, are we? Doct-\nDOCTOR: Walls have ears, remember? Elevators too.\nAUTOMATED: VOICE Approaching G.F. One. Concorp thanks you for your work. Concorp, where everyone matters. Doors opening.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: THEY EXIT INTO RECEPTION, CROSSING FLOOR:\nFLIP: Seriously, Doctor. We can’t just run out on everyone!\nDOCTOR: We’re going back to the TARDIS. Much as it pains me to do so, I’m calling in the Time Lords.\nFLIP: What, really?\nDOCTOR: I’ve no choice. A vaccine developed from my own Gallifreyan immunity is about to be misused to the most terrible end. Worse, it may turn out to be the herald of some sort of biological apocalypse. — (STOPS) Something’s wrong.\nFLIP: Yeah, no Knight blokes standing sentry in Concorp reception. Why’s that, then?\nSIL: (ENTERING) Why do you think, you revolting hideous creature?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 130\nSIL: Because they’re all been waiting in ambush. Knights Marshal, advance!\nSIL: CLATTERING IN FROM OFF, SURROUNDING THE DOCTOR AND FLIP.\nSIL: (BEING LED FORWARD) Well, Doctor. I doubt even you can contrive to escape your long-overdue liquidisation on this occasion.\nDOCTOR: Admittedly, the odds do seem against it. I would try appealing to your better nature, Sil, but...\nSIL: To presume that I possess the smallest microgram of pity would be\nSIL: most insulting!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 69: INT. CONCORP — COMMS CENTRE\nFLIP: (D) How’d you know we were coming, slugface?\nSIL: (D) Mistress Cordelia raised the alarm, of course.\nCORDELIA: (APPROACHING) You — Bob, whoever you are. Have the internal cameras picked up the Doctor and his companion?\nBOB: There you go, ma’am, they’ve been recaptured — see?\nCORDELIA: Good. I want to see the Doctor compressed into utter malformation. I want to keep him in a glass box where I can forever gaze in pleasure at the agony of his shrivelled existence.\nBOB: Whatever plugs you in, ma’am.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 70: INT. CONCORP — RECEPTION\nFLIP: You won’t get away with it, you know. The Time Lords are coming.\nSIL: A feeble bluff. The Time Lords are only interested in protecting their monopoly on near-immortality, they won’t be involving themselves on this occasion.\nDOCTOR: Unlike back on Thoros Beta, of course...?\nFLIP: What, when they killed Cordelia’s Dad?\nDOCTOR: I can’t believe the Time Lords would have executed young Crozier. But only Sil knows the truth — don’t you, Sil?\nSIL: It pains me to remember. When the time storm abated, the great Lord Kiv, whose magnificent mind was supposed to have been placed within the repulsive body of the Doctor’s young companion, was no more. Lord Kiv was dead. Dead!\nDOCTOR: I knew it.\nSIL: Young Crozier had failed my masters; how else could I have appeased them but by having him ‘fired’ .. so to speak?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 71: INT. CONCORP — COMMS CENTRE\nCORDELIA: (GASPING) No! NO!!!\nBOB: You all right there?\nDOCTOR: (ON SCREEN) So what was Cordelia to you, Sil? Just another mark, another human resource to be exploited?\nSIL: (ON SCREEN) A fine young talent grown greater still, since I gave her the right motivation!\nFLIP: (ON SCREEN) You killed her father, you lying scumbag!\nCORDELIA: (ROARING) Sil! I shall see you suffer for this!!!\nBOB: All right, don’t lose your connection.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 72: INT. PAN & CERISE’S APARTMENT\nPAN: (COMING ROUND) Cerise-? (GROANING) Oh, no. What have you done-?\nCERISE: Helped the Doctor and Flip to escape. The Knights Marshal will arrest me and and kill me, probably. I don’t really care.\nPAN: (GETTING UP) We’ve got to get out of here!\nCERISE: Don’t worry, Pan. I’1ll tell them you had no part in it. If they don’t believe me, Concorp have truth drugs. You’1l be all right, good company man like you.\nPAN: You don’t understand. You don’t know what’s going to happen. I couldn’t risk telling you, Cerise — not even in here, in case we\nPAN: were under surveillance.\nCORDELIA: Couldn’t risk telling me what?\nPAN: Part of my duties as a ‘trusted employee’ is to regulate the influx of the water enhancement drugs, the reason people accept their lot and do not rebel.\nCERISE: We both know that.\nPAN: I saw a chance to alter the world as it is to something you would like it to be.\nCERISE: What have you done? Pan?\nPAN: I’ve been manipulating the influx system controls, draining the narcoplaxamine away into an emergency reservoir. No sedative drugs have been fed into the public water supply for the past three days!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 73: INT. CONCORP — RECEPTION\nSIL: Generally speaking, Doctor, I do not approve of bringing personal issues into the work environment.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad to hear it.\nSIL: But given that I now have the opportunity to have you and your horrid little apprentice lasered to death... I am prepared to make an exception!\nFLIP: Go on, knock yourself out.\nSIL: Knights Marshal, raise your weapons. (FX: A MULTITUDE OF HOISTED RIFLES) On my command — wait for it, wait for it —\nSIL: What was that? Who threw that projectile?\nDOCTOR: (PUZZLED) It came from outside.\nSIL: Someone is attacking the tower!\nMOB: Down with Concorp!\nMOB: Concorp hates us!\nMOB: Concorp doesn’t care! [REPEAT THROUGH: ]\nFLIP: It’s people. Thousands of people, coming up from the underground!\nDOCTOR: Marching on the tower! It’s a mob!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 136\nSIL: Great Morgo, it’s the proles! Knights Marshal — defend the tower! Shoot them, you doltards! We’1l be over-run!\nFLIP: Doctor, we’d better get out of here.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think someone else has the same idea...\nSIL: The rabble are entering the building, invading our sanctity,! , Bearers, carry me away,! Carry me away,, right now! Ah, thank you, good bearers, sweet bearers, so kind...\nPAN: (EXITING LIFT) The insurrection! Cerise, it’s already begun!\nCERISE: (FOLLOWING) Pan, we have to stop the slaughter!\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER) Just what I was thinking, young lady. Once the Marshals’ weapons run down, they won’t stand a chance. We must persuade them to surrender.\nFLIP: But what started all this? Why have the people turned on Concorp?\nCERISE: It was Pan, Flip. Pan did it! Pan!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 74: INT. CONCORP — BOARDROOM\nKRISTAL: RUSHING IN.\nBOSCOE: Hurry, Kristal, hurry! Knights Marshal — barricade the Boardroom, we need to protect ourselves!\nKRISTAL: I don’t understand, Mr President. What’s happening out there?\nBOSCOE: Mass outbreaks of civil disobedience, all over the capital! The underground tribes rising up in — well, protest, I suppose.\nKRISTAL: But how can this have happened? The water supply in the city was not affected by the shortages!\nBOSCOE: This is the work of Hang Seng saboteurs, it must be. Are we all accounted for? Where’s Sil?\nKRISTAL: I know I had my doubts... but it’s time to act, Mr President. Time to implement the plague plan. Is everything in place?\nCORDELIA: (AT DOOR, A BIT STRANGE AND SLURRY) You will all need to be vaccinated first.\nBOSCOE: Ms Crozier! Just who we need. Knights Marshal, let her past!\nKRISTAL: Has she got it? Has she brought the vaccine?\nCORDELIA: (COMING OVER) Where is Sil? Where is that green monster?\nBOSCOE: I’m not sure. All the members of the Board were sent a message to assemble here. I’ve ordered a sky car, to meet us on the roof.\nKRISTAL: But that’s a sky car, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 138\nBOSCOE: No, why’s it leaving? Come back! Come back! I don’t understand...\nCORDELIA: (LAUGHS HOLLOWLY) I do, Mr President. The slug has got [SNEEZING] A-A-ATCHOO!\nKRISTAL: Are you — (DISTASTE) — unwell?\nCORDELIA: Undoubtedly.\nBOSCOE: Never mind that. The vaccine, have you brought the vaccine with you?\nCORDELIA: Only the plagues, Mr President. I came here to give them to Sil... but I shall have to make do with infecting the rest of you instead. (SNEEZES VIOLENTLY )\nBOSCOE: Infecting us-?\nBOSCOE: CORDELIA/VELENA\nBOSCOE: (POSSESSED, LIKE FLIP WAS) Come to me, Mr President. Come to me and receive the New Black Death, and Titan Cholera. All of you Concorpians, come and receive Creeping moon fever, Lasarti’s Wasting, lavapox and the Darkspace Plague. Come receive the kiss of the Velendari. It is time to settle your account.\nBOSCOE: (TERRIFIED) No! No! Nooooo-!\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 75: EXT. CONCORP HO IN B/G, SOME LAUGHTER, RUNNING FEET, AN EXCITED CHEER OR TWO.\nDOCTOR WHO: FLIP. Come on, Doctor. We’ve done everything we can here.\nCERISE: More than enough.\nDOCTOR: No, I have to go back to the laboratory.\nFLIP: What?!\nDOCTOR: I need to make sure Ms Crozier’s plagues are properly made safe. The last thing we need is the Velendari [getting out]\nPAN: What was that-?\nDOCTOR: Looks to me like that was the Boardroom exploding.\nFLIP: Doctor, you don’t think — Cordelia...?\nDOCTOR: More likely the Knights Marshal going out in a blaze of glory. But I daresay that towering inferno will take care of our problem. Even the worst diseases of the universe will not survive that holocaust.\nFLIP: Yeah, neither will Sil.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. I suppose he was beyond redemption.\nCERISE: Concorp has fallen. We owe you so much, Doctor, Flip.\nFLIP: It’s Pan you should be thanking, girl.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 140\nCERISE: I know.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 76: INT. SKY CAR — IN FLIGHT\nSKY: CAR WHOOSHES PAST. CROSS-FADE TO INTERIOR PERSPECTIVE. SIL AND MISTRESS NA, A FEMALE THOROS-BETAN WHO HAS A SING-SONG VOICE.\nSIL: My dear Mistress Na, how good of you to commandeer a sky car to effect my rescue.\nSIL: NA The Hang Seng always try to protect their agents.\nSIL: But to send such a beautiful protectress only enhances my good fortune — eh, little Anzor?\nMINI: ANZOR Fiddlesticks! Fiddlesticks!\nSIL: I do wish you’d learn to say something else.\nSIL: NA Look at those humans down there, running about, attacking the towers of government.\nSIL: (CHUCKLES) Chaos is come. A fractured society will take years and years to rebuild. There should be many business opportunities for the Hang Seng to exploit. I do hope my part in this triumph will not be forgotten when you make your report...?\nSIL: NA The downfall of Concorp is most satisfactory to us.\nSIL: I trust our masters will look on U.M.F. losses as only temporary? I argued against setting an incendiary device in Ms Crozier’s laboratory but would my masters listen? It is hard being a subordinate, I had to obey. (SIGHS)\nSIL: NA Did you have some kind of attachment to the human female?\nSIL: Of course not. I knew her father, once. He was a nuisance, too. No, it’s just the patent on that panacea of hers might have been worth a fortune.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: NA\nDOCTOR WHO: Perhaps. But it is better for our agents to cover their tracks. Tell me, Sil, truth between Mentors, was it planning, opportunity or simply blind chance that brought about your success?\nSIL: Between ourselves, Mistress Na, a little of all ..all... three... Ah... Ah... Atishoo!\nSIL: NA (ALARM) What was that?\nSIL: A sneeze. Oh dear, I do hope I haven’t caught something nasty.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 77: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: There goes Anzor’s TARDIS, on its way back to Gallifrey. Probably best if the Time Lords don’t discover who programmed the co- ordinates...\nFLIP: Doctor, will Britain ever be as it once was?\nDOCTOR: I’ve always found it a most resilient nation. Its people may hibernate for long periods but when they do wake up, watch out.\nFLIP: So — where to next? (A BIT GLUM) S’pose you’1ll be wanting to go after your friend Peri, find out what really happened to her.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I intend to do. Although there are one or two, shall we say, variables to be considered first, hmmm... Why,\nDOCTOR: is there somewhere else you’d rather go to first? Don’t say Atlantis.\nDOCTOR: FLIP. We did interrupt our holiday on Tranquillity; I don’t suppose...\nDOCTOR: No, that would be an escape from reality. (BEAT) But then again, you have been ill.\nFLIP: Struck down by a deadly disease.\nDOCTOR: Teetering on the very edge of oblivion.\nFLIP: That’s so true.\nDOCTOR: You, Miss Jackson, are in need of recuperation. Tranquillity might indeed be the correct antidote! (FX: BUTTON-PRESSING; SETTING CO- ORDINATES) Yes, I would be prepared, in the circumstances, to assist with your convalescence. Not too long a stay, mind.\nFLIP: That’s really kind of you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: ANTIDOTE TO OBLIVION by Philip Martin Page 144\nDOCTOR: Not at all, Flip, considering all you’ve been through, it’s the very least I can do.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
