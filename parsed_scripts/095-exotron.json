      "searchable_dialogue": "DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, Peri. Haven’t you collected enough samples already?\nPERI: I couldn’t resist, Doctor. Gotcha. See? This one has completely different leaves to the one we saw on the other dunes. The variegation would seem to indicate that cross-pollination occurs within related species. Here, for example, you can make out that... Sorry, I’m lecturing. Hope you’re not getting bored.\nDOCTOR: Of course not. It’s always good to listen to someone with a passion for their subject. You know, to the untrained eye, this is just an expanse of dead scrubland.\nPERI: Actually, it’s shrubland. Very xeric. That means dry.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you. I have studied Greek.\nPERI: We'll just scrub out your mistake then, shall we?\nDOCTOR: You should have brought a bigger bag. Those xerophytes are never going to fit.\nPERI: So you do know something about botany. Actually, I was sort of hoping you’d help carry these. I want to take a look over the rise. Please?\nDOCTOR: Of course. As long as you don’t load me down with too many succulents and geophytes and other related specimens which store water in their root systems in such xeric environments as this one. Come on, then.\nPERI: (laughs) Okay, I get the point. Did you get anywhere following those footprints?\nDOCTOR: In a manner of speaking. The wind had wiped them out once I got beyond the shelter of the dune.\nPERI: Yeah?\nDOCTOR: Well, I found this spanner. No corrosion, which would indicate it was dropped fairly recently, so I'd conclude there’s humanoid life here.\nSHREENI: (distant) Well, get down there and give it a kick or something.\nPERI: And I’d conclude that two examples of it are right up that pylon.\nDOCTOR: So they are.\nWEISS: (distant, a woman) It was working earlier.\nDOCTOR: Well then, shall we give them their spanner back?\nPERI: Hey, maybe they can tell us the indigenous names for the plants. Come on.\nDOCTOR: Maybe they can carry them for you.\nPERI: A little sand never hurt anyone.\nDOCTOR: (echoes) Honestly, you’d think I was a wheelbarrow.\nPERI: (laughs) What was that?\nDOCTOR: I said, perhaps they’d carry them for you.\nPERI: No, you didn’t. You said something about being a wheelbarrow.\nDOCTOR: Interesting.\nPERI: More fractious, I'd say.\nDOCTOR: Could be something out of synch with the Tardis’s telepathic circuits. Now I wonder what’s causing that? For a moment there, you were able to hear what I was thinking.\nPERI: Do you often think about being a wheelbarrow?\nDOCTOR: You know, it really does look as though those two are doing something fascinating to that pylon. Come on.\nPERI: Okay, okay. I'll only make you carry the small ones in future.\nSHREENI: Oh damn it. Why can’t they design these blinking pylons with the circuit hatches at the bleeding bottom.\nWEISS: You all right up there, Shreeni?\nSHREENI: Oh yeah, right blinking marvellous, me. Right. 0357. Right then, you over-complicated little gizmo, Major Taylor wants the Net boosted before the first colonist shuttle arrives, and what Major Taylor wants, Major Taylor gets, so (buzz) Ow! Hey, have you got that wave amplifier in position down there yet? I’m still getting power surges here.\nWEISS: Yeah, yeah, it’s all set up. It'll just be residuals. Here, I’ve got one for you. This Farakosh goes into a bar, right.\nSHREENI: Residuals, my foot. Now then, lets just get this end of the booster cable attached to here.\nWEISS: And it says to the barman, I'll have a Kalinka, a Tokay wine, and er, mmm, schnapps.\nSHREENI: Gotcha. Right, you can hook down your end of the cable into the amplifier now.\nWEISS: And the barman says, sure, mate, but why the huge paws?\nSHREENI: That’s got her. What?\nWEISS: Why the huge paws! P a ws. Get it? Farakosh. Paws.\nSHREENI: Listen, if Taylor... hey, paws. That ain’t bad.\nPERI: You know we tell that joke where I come from.\nWEISS: What the?\nSHREENI: What? Who are they? What’s going on down there?\nDOCTOR: Well, my botanist friend here is Peri, and I’m the...\nSHREENI: Oh no. Weiss?\nWEISS: I heard it, Shreeni.\nSHREENI: Get those two into some spare harnesses and get up here now!\nPERI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: it’s all right, Peri. I take it you know what made that sound?\nWEISS: Yeah, it’s a blinking Farakosh.\nSHREENI: This is Sergeant Shreeni to Eluhod 2-7 Central lab. We got trouble. A Farakosh has got our scent. Request Exotron support.\nDOCTOR: No time for the harnesses, Peri. Move to the other side of the pylon. You too, Weiss\nWEISS: Shreeni. Shreeni, hold on up there. It’s\nSHREENI: It’s trying to eat the pylon!\nPERI: Doctor! The cable. Look out!\nSHREENI: Watch out!\nDOCTOR: Shreeni! You’d better jump. It’s got the pylon support.\nSHREENI: Oh, for gawd’s sake. Look out below!\nPERI: Doctor!\nPERI: (coughing) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Peri, are you all right?\nPERI: I... I think so. My lungs are full of sand.\nDOCTOR: It could have been worse.\nPERI: Doctor, the guy, Shreeni. Is he?\nSHREENI: Not dead yet.\nDOCTOR: Hurry. We need to get him out before that thing fully regains its senses. Once he’s safe, then maybe I can help the creature too. Can you stand?\nPERI: I don’t know. I... Is that a robot?\nDOCTOR: Ah, perfect. Over here! We've got a man...\nDOCTOR: Stop! Cease fire! There was no need for that. (receding) It was a defenceless animal! It posed no threat.\nPERI: Doctor! Where are you going? Doctor!\nTAYLOR: Exotron. Make sure the Farakosh is dead, then see if you can get Sergeant Shreeni out from under that section of pylon.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Excuse me. Hello? Yes, I’m speaking to you. Are you some kind of robot?\nTAYLOR: Wait. Where did that civilian come from?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: I wonder if you’d mind telling me exactly why you just killed a defenceless creature in cold blood.\nTAYLOR: Seize him, immediately. Bring him to me at the Central Med Block.\nDOCTOR: (distant) Hey, put me down. There’s a man over there who needs urgent medical attention. Please, put me down! (receding) Look, we really do need to help that man.\nPERI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (distant) I said, that man needs to be helped.\nPERI: What? Oh, of course. Shreeni.\nSHREENI: (groans and coughs) I’m still here, just about.\nPERI: Hold on. I'll see if I...\nPAULA: Hey!\nPERI: What? Hello. Thank goodness. We need help.\nPAULA: Lay one finger on him and you’re both dead.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Please, could you just slow down? Are you listening to me, you... robot? I’m the Doctor. I\nDOCTOR: take it you’re controlled by some sort of remote device, yes?\nTAYLOR: Who is this Doctor? Where did he come from?\nDOCTOR: [OC]: The silent type, eh? Well, you certainly don’t look like a robot sophisticated enough to think for itself. Ah, that’s interesting. A speech grill but no apparent inclination to communicate. Why is that, I wonder?\nTAYLOR: Perhaps he was sent by Ballantyne to check up on me.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: You're built for military application, I assume. No one but the military would design something so grey and unaesthetic. But not with the usual field training protocols, otherwise you’d have helped that poor man back there.\nTAYLOR: Not from Ballantyne, then. He doesn’t seem to know about the Exotron Project, about me.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Or perhaps those protocols were overridden by whoever’s controlling you.\nTAYLOR: Wait. He knows. He must have been sent by Earth Authority, then. Somehow they’ve got at Ballantyne, and this Doctor here is to take the Project from me.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: The question is, why is it more important to capture me than to help an injured human being?\nTAYLOR: Quick, bring him here. Quickly!\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Well, it looks like I'll find out soon enough.\nPERI: Look, I don’t know who you are, but I haven’t touched him.\nPAULA: Good, because the power’s still live. There. Sorry, but if you’d touched him you’d have earthed the circuit and fried yourselves. How are you, Shreeni?\nSHREENI: I’ve had better days. Is Weiss... ?\nPAULA: Dead, I’m afraid. I’m sorry. I know how fond you were of her. Now, let’s see about getting you out of here.\nPERI: Here, let me help. Do you know these guys?\nPAULA: They sometimes get assigned to my team. I heard gunfire. What happened?\nPERI: We were attacked by a kind of big mutant hyena. A Fara-something, Weiss called it.\nPAULA: Farakosh. Don't tell me you’ve never heard of one before? Of course. You’re from off-world, aren't you. I didn’t think the colonist’s shuttle was due to land until this afternoon. What are you doing out here?\nPERI: Er, er... Shouldn’t we be helping Shreeni under there?\nPAULA: You're right. Help me with this. (effort) Well, the Farakosh were the top of the food chain until we arrived to begin terraforming the planet. They usually don’t attack unless they're provoked.\nSHREENI: Oh, careful.\nPAULA: Sorry, Shreeni, but we’re going to have to lift this thing off you. Okay?\nPERI: I’ve got this side.\nPAULA: After three. One, two\nSHREENI: Tell Major Taylor that\nPAULA: Oh, don’t worry. I'll have a few choice words for Major Taylor. Three.\nPERI: Will he be okay?\nPAULA: As long as we get him back to the outpost. Take his other arm.\nSHREENI: I can walk, I think, if you support me.\nPERI: Er, who’s Major Taylor?\nPAULA: We haven’t decided who you are yet, remember?\nPERI: Sorry. My name’s Peri.\nPAULA: Well, Peri, you must be pretty shaken up after that attack. Are you sure you weren't provoking the Farakosh?\nPERI: Provoking it? I didn’t even know its name until ten minutes ago.\nPAULA: Sorry. Sometimes I get as paranoid as Hector. The Major we spoke of. He’s the commander of our outpost here. He’s about as good at doing that as he was at being a husband.\nPERI: Oh, I see.\nPAULA: Do you? I wish I did. Anyway, I’m Paula. Paula Taylor. I’m head of the geological team. Chief terraformer. So it’s not entirely inappropriate for me to say, welcome to my world.\nPERI: Thanks. So, is it far to the outpost?\nPAULA: No. Eluhod 2-7 is over this way, about five klicks.\nPERI: Well, I don’t know what a klick is, but this is the way the robot took the Doctor.\nPAULA: The Doctor? Who’s he, then? It sounds like you’ve got a story which’ll make those five klicks fly by. Come on, you can tell us on the way.\nTANNOY: Colonist’s shuttle ETA 95 minutes. All personnel to take up welcoming positions.\nDOCTOR: Ah. The only way to travel. A reception committee. I feel honoured.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me. We haven't been introduced. I’m the Doctor.\nMOZZ: I’m to take you to Major Taylor.\nDOCTOR: Good. If he’s the man in charge, I’d rather like to talk to him myself, Private...?\nMOZZ: Corporal. Corporal Mozz. You there. Open the hangar doors for the Exotron. Take it in and power it down.\nSOLDIER: Sah!\nDOCTOR: Ah. So this is an Exotron. Hmm.\nMOZZ: You, follow me.\nDOCTOR: My pleasure, Corporal.\nTAYLOR: Need... to rest. Come!\nMOZZ: Major Taylor. We’ve brought the unidentified male.\nDOCTOR: Hardly unidentified. I have already told you who I am.\nTAYLOR: Thank you, Corporal. Just wait outside, would you?\nMOZZ: Sir.\nTAYLOR: Perhaps you’d like to start by telling me how you landed on this planet undetected by my outpost’s sensors, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Not unidentified after all, then. You can’t have heard me introduce myself to your men, so it must be some kind of monitoring device in the er... Exotron that brought me here.\nTAYLOR: Ingenious reasoning, Doctor. I congratulate you.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. I take it you’re the man responsible for giving the Exotron its orders.\nTAYLOR: You think so? Tell me, how much do you know about the Exotrons?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. How much should I know?\nTAYLOR: (laughs) Now, Doctor, we can’t pussyfoot around each other all day. Surely there’s room for a little candour between men such as ourselves?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I have nothing to hide, Major Taylor. Have you?\nTAYLOR: I'll Keep this brief, Doctor. I’m a busy man. I know why Earth Authority has sent you.\nDOCTOR: Now why would you assume I’m from Earth Authority?\nTAYLOR: I do not like to play games!\nDOCTOR: Neither do I. I witnessed the brutal killing of a creature at the hands of your military organisation, Major. Perhaps you'd care to explain that?\nTAYLOR: The Farakosh attack us, and my Exotrons defend us.\nDOCTOR: That Farakosh creature was utterly helpless by the time your Exotron arrived.\nTAYLOR: Listen, I have brought this outpost in under budget and on time, with minimum assistance from your precious Offices of Earth Authority, and I have achieved this by creating the Exotrons.\nDOCTOR: Not only without the assistance of Earth Authority, without their knowledge either, it seems. What is it you are hiding, Major Taylor?\nTAYLOR: I see what’s happening here, Doctor. Whatever you know about the Exotrons, you must have learned somehow from Secretary for the Interior Ballantyne, and you are here to take the Project from me.\nDOCTOR: Is there something about the Exotrons that you’re ashamed of?\nTAYLOR: Doctor, may I see your Earth Authority identification?\nDOCTOR: Did I say I was from Earth Authority?\nTAYLOR: (intercom) Corporal, be so good as to step back in here a moment, would you?\nMOZZ: [OC]: Sir.\nDOCTOR: What have you created here, Major Taylor? Because whatever it is, it doesn’t look like it’s helping you sleep at night. Your skin’s grey, your eyes are hollow, your body gaunt.\nTAYLOR: The pressures of command.\nDOCTOR: Do I have to spell it out? Your exhaustion coupled with the fact that you monitored my arrival here through the Exotron, tells me that you are somehow controlling these robots. Controlling them through a form of cerebral link, yes? Now, the interface would need to be close to your office. How about behind that door. Do stop me if I’m wandering wide of the mark.\nTAYLOR: Ah, Corporal.\nMOZZ: Sir.\nTAYLOR: I’ve established that the Doctor here is a spy, trying to undermine Earth Authority's terraforming policy. Please be so good as to show him the detention block.\nMOZZ: Sir.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Major. You may think yourself very clever for having created a telepathic network which controls robots over great distances, but let me tell you the implications of using such a network are unfathomable! Regardless of the obvious danger to your own health, just think of the devastation that could be caused by a robotic army controlled by a single military mind.\nTAYLOR: I created the Exotrons to protect this settlement, Doctor. Nothing more. Take him away.\nDOCTOR: Wait, Major. You don’t know what you’re dealing with.\nTAYLOR: Doctor, believe me. I know exactly what I’m dealing with.\nPERI: So with all the chaos, I lost my samples. And then before I could free myself from the pylon, this robot grabbed the Doctor and took off.\nPAULA: That was an Exotron.\nSHREENI: It saved our lives, that’s for sure.\nPAULA: Really, Shreeni. I’m surprised you remembered much of the incident. You were barely conscious at the time. Listen, Peri, the Exotron will doubtless be taking your Doctor friend to Hector. The Exotrons are Hector’s pet project. He designed them to protect my geological survey teams when we work far from the outpost.\nPERI: Then where are they? You’re out here on your own.\nPAULA: The Farakosh never bother me when I’m working. Oh they come close sometimes, but they just kind of stare at me then lope away.\nPERI: Aren’t you scared?\nPAULA: What's to be scared of? In over two years they’ve never one done anything other than stare at me. They only go crazy when the Exotrons are around.\nPERI: Maybe they don’t like metal. That Farakosh did seem to be attacking the pylon rather than Shreeni and Weiss.\nSHREENI: Whoever heard of an animal that doesn’t like metal? If it hadn’t been for the Exotron...\nPAULA: If it hadn’t been for the Exotron, that Farakosh would still be alive and we could ask it. How else to you explain the fact that they only attack humans when Hector’s machines show up?\nSHREENI: Well, it attacked us before the Exotron showed up. They’d kill us all if they got the chance. I think they’re planning something. They’ve been getting worse lately, more and more of them massing around the main compound.\nPAULA: Nonsense, Shreeni. Anyway, what were you and Weiss doing to that pylon?\nSHREENI: Boosting the Exotron Net signal. Major Taylor wants it twelve and a half percent stronger before the colonist’s shuttle arrives.\nPAULA: And a half? Oh, you have to admire the man’s military precision. Well, we don’t need the Exotrons and their stupid Net. I’ve studied the Farakosh and they are not hostile. I’ve told Hector until I’m blue in the face, but he won't listen.\nPERI: You're still on speaking terms, then. After the divorce, I mean.\nPAULA: When we have to. We try to be friends, but it’s not so easy. Well, not when there’s someone else involved.\nPERI: I’m sorry.\nPAULA: I told Hector I’d stop the geological surveys if he insisted I take an Exotron with me. He refused, so now I have to sneak out to do the field work. On my own, mosily.\nPERI: What about the other geologists?\nPAULA: They’re scared. It’s easier if I do it on my own.\nSHREENI: Well, I’m scared too. We're still two klicks from the base and, well, I’m not in any shape to fight passing Farakosh in search of a quick bite eat, metal or otherwise.\nPAULA: Chin up, brave soldier. We'll get you to the medical block.\nTAYLOR: Come on, come on. Answer, damn it.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Major Taylor. Always a pleasure to hear from you.\nTAYLOR: What’s going on, Ballantyne? I tried to reach you at your Brussels office, but they re-routed me to your personal line.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: I have some fairly understanding secretaries. I’ve asked them to transfer all calls from certain individuals. More discreet, you understand. What can I do for you?\nTAYLOR: There’s an Earth Authority agent here asking questions about the Exotron Project.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Is there indeed?\nTAYLOR: At least, I assume he’s from Earth Authority. Calls himself the Doctor. It seemed logical to assume they were onto us and had somehow got information from you.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Don't be ridiculous. Even if they had reason to investigate me, they couldn't trace my private funds. How much does he know, this Doctor?\nTAYLOR: Not much, but he’s clever. He almost worked out the whole thing standing in front of me in my own office.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Just stay calm. He can’t know anything. He’s just guessing, bluffing.\nTAYLOR: I don’t think so. It wasn’t so much what he said, it was the way he said it.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Calm down, Hector. There’s a lot riding on this project, not the least of which is your reputation.\nTAYLOR: This project has got out of hand. I only started it to protect my wife.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Ex-wife, Major. And if I hadn’t supplied the money for the last eighteen months, you’d\nBALLANTYNE: be up to your neck in debt with Earth Authority, and that outpost would have been discontinued as unprofitable. And who knows what would have happened to your lovely little ex-wife then.\nTAYLOR: Maybe she'd still be my wife.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Oh, for pity’s sake, pull yourself together, man. You’re supposed to be a soldier. We agreed to make the change in direction with the Exotrons, and the risks have paid off. Selling the project to the military will be the easy part.\nTAYLOR: You’re right, of course. I’m just tired. Guiding the Exotron Net isn’t easy.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Spare me the sob story. I trust you'll be fit in time for the arrival of the first colonist’s shuttle.\nTAYLOR: It’s all under control. When the shuttle lands it'll be protected by three full units of Exotrons.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Good. It wouldn’t send out quite the right message to potential buyers were the first colonists to step off the ship and straight into the jaws of two dozen Farakosh.\nTAYLOR: Just a second. I have another call. Give me a moment, Sergeant.\nMOZZ: [OC]: Sir.\nTAYLOR: Ballantyne, this Doctor worries me.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Everything worries you, Taylor. Where is he now?\nTAYLOR: They’re taking him down to the detention block. We have him on suspicion of espionage.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Then just forget about him. He’s harmless. If Earth Authority really did suspect something, they’d have sent you the paperwork first. You know what sticklers they are for protocol. This man is obviously just some chancer.\nTAYLOR: Oh, that’s worse. It means anyone could know about the project. What if he’s an independent arms trader?\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Then we deal with him. Just relax, Hector, and keep me informed of developments. Everything is going as planned. Ballantyne out.\nTAYLOR: What is it, Sergeant?\nMOZZ: {OC]: It’s your ex-wife, Major. She’s out in the dunes.\nTAYLOR: What! You and your men are incompetent, Sergeant!\nMOZZ: [OC]: Yes, sir. She knows we’re watching her now and somehow she always manages to... lose us.\nTAYLOR: Open the Exotron hangar doors. I’m sending a squad to get her.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating little outpost you have here. Tell me, do you get to decorate your own locker?\nMOZZ: Just call the lift and keep your hands where I can see them. (echoes) Give me one excuse, and so help me I'll put a bullet in you.\nDOCTOR: Ah, interesting.\nMOZZ: I said, keep your hands where I can see them!\nCOMPUTER: Elevator doors opening.\nDOCTOR: (echoes) Actually, what you said was you wanted to put a bullet in me.\nMOZZ: What the? How did...\nDOCTOR: Going down.\nDOCTOR: Bargain basement all right for you?\nCOMPUTER: Elevator doors closing. Descending.\nMOZZ: [OC]: Oi, come back here.\nCOMPUTER: Elevator malfunction. (slows) Elevator malfunction.\nMOZZ: Oi, you, stop! Stop or I fire.\nMOZZ: Detainee alert. Repeat, detainee alert. Prisoner’s blond, six foot tall, and possibly dangerous. He’s entered the northern stairwell of the central Med block. Shoot to wound, not to kill. Corporal Mozz in pursuit. Right, Doctor, you’d better pray they get you before I do.\nPAULA: Exotrons. Peri, quick, make for that dune. We need to take cover.\nSHREENI: What the hell for? They're on our side.\nPAULA: That’s why Farakosh.\nPERI: Oh, they're everywhere.\nPAULA: Just stay still. They won’t hurt us.\nSHREENI: Oh my Gawd. Exotrons, over here! For Gawd’s sake!\nPAULA: No, hold your fire.\nPERI: Shreeni, can you run?\nSHREENI: Faster than you can, darling.\nPAULA: Peri, Shreeni, don’t move. You have to trust me.\nPERI: They’re going to tear us to pieces! Look out! (screams)"

      "searchable_dialogue": "DOCTOR: Now, where am I? Ah, an office. Empty, at least. (approaching footsteps) (thinks) Please don’t come in here, there’s a good Mozz. (speaks) Hello again, Corporal Mozz, isn’t it? You decided to take the stairs, I see.\nMOZZ: (breathless) Shut it. Move and you’re dead.\nPAULA: Exotrons, cease fire. The Farakosh don’t want to harm anyone. Just stop! Stupid damn robot, what do you think you’re doing? Go away!\nPERI: I think these three want to rescue us.\nSHREENI: Sounds fine by me.\nPAULA: I don’t need rescuing. Get off me! Hey! Put me down! Put me down!\nSHREENI: Well, don’t just stand there, Exotron. Rescue us.\nPERI: I’m guessing this is going to be a... ow! Bumpy ride.\nSHREENI: Just hang on.\nDOCTOR: Ah, now, let’s not be too hasty about this, Corporal.\nMOZZ: Just don’t start any of your mind tricks.\nDOCTOR: Mind tricks?\nMOZZ: Speaking inside me head. Please don’t come in here, there’s a good Mozz. That’s what you said.\nDOCTOR: Ah. That’s how you knew I was in here, was it? Interesting. Well, perhaps I might allay your fears by explaining. You see, this outpost and the area around it seems to be saturated with telepathic fields. (thinks) I take it you know what telepathy is?\nMOZZ: Stop it. Get out me head!\nDOCTOR: (thinks) In a moment. But first let me tell you about a fascinating theory. Some scholars of telepathy have held that two minds connected to each other cannot only converse like we’re doing now, but can also influence each other.\nMOZZ: I’m warning you. If you... if you\nDOCTOR: (thinks) Of course, you’d need to be in an area awash with liberal quantities of telepathic energy.\nMOZZ: My orders are to\nDOCTOR: (thinks) And you’d need a stronger mind already versed in the rudiments of telepathy in order to dominate the weaker.\nMOZZ: To... to... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (thinks) It’s an interesting theory, don’t you think? That gun looks very heavy, Corporal. I’d lay it down on the table if I were you. (thud) You look tired. Why don’t you go back to your quarters and have a lie- down.\nMOZZ: Maybe I need a lie-down, yeah.\nDOCTOR: (thinks) It’s a shame you haven’t seen the escaped prisoner.\nMOZZ: Yeah, a shame I couldn’t find the prisoner. I wanted to.\nDOCTOR: (thinks) I know you did. There’s a good Corporal. Make yourself a cup of tea while you’re at it.\nDOCTOR: Looks like telepathy is the key to quite a lot around here. Now, I wonder.\nPAULA: Peri, are you okay?\nPERI: I think so.\nSHREENI: There’s the outpost. We’re nearly there.\nPERI: The Farakosh are heading for the compound. Look, some are already making for the main entrance. They're going inside the place!\nTAYLOR: [OC]: Who is this girl? Another spy? Things are getting out of hand. But she’s right, the Farakosh are attacking like never before.\nPERI: [OC]: Oh! These things need to practice their handbrake turns.\nPAULA: [OC]: Looks like the other Exotrons are leading the Farakosh away.\nSHREENI: [OC]: It’s to protect us. I told you they’d look after us.\nTAYLOR: Exotrons, where are you taking them? I did not order this. Obey my command! Bring them here to the central Net block. Do it! Bring me my wife!\nPAULA: [OC]: I think we’re going to make it, Peri. Not many of the Farakosh are following us.\nTAYLOR: Exotrons, why won’t you obey me? The Net is boosted thirty percent beyond capacity. Why don’t they listen to me?\nDOCTOR: Old-fashioned computers. So much easier to hack into. There we are. The frequency specifications of the Exotron Net. Hmm. On the floor, I think. Back straight. Now, if the Tardis isn’t out of range, I should be able to link with its telepathic circuits and use their power to force my way inside Major Taylor’s little science project. Time to open those doors of perception.\nPAULA: Inside, quickly.\nSHREENI: Why’d they put us down at the geology block?\nPERI: Maybe they recognised Paula.\nPAULA: They’re just tools, Peri. They have no capacity for intelligence.\nPERI: Nevertheless, I think your Exotron is fond of you. He doesn’t seem to want to leave you alone.\nPAULA: Well, the disgusting thing’s staying out there.\nPERI: I doubt it could get through the doorway without destroying it, anyway. Maybe Hector programmed it specially to look after you.\nPAULA: That'd be just like him. Trying to do something nice for me and deciding on the one thing that'll annoy me most. Come on, there’s a med kit in my office. Let’s get you sorted out, Shreeni.\nSHREENI: It won’t hurt, will it?\nCHRISTIAN: [OC]: Doctor, we have been waiting for you. Help us.\nTAYLOR: [OC]: No, Doctor. You are not welcome here.\nDOCTOR: (gasps) Well, I wasn’t expecting that. There’s definitely some kind of constructive telepathic link here. But there’s something else too. Well, whatever it is, I'll be ready for it this time.\nPAULA: You’re a very lucky man, Shreeni. Apart from a few broken ribs, it’s mainly just cuts and bruises. You'll be fit enough to climb pylons again before the lunar cycle is out.\nSHREENI: Oh, that’ll please Major Taylor.\nPAULA: Leave Major Taylor to me. Arm, please. This injection should help the pain.\nSHREENI: Ow! Shouldn't that be help ease the pain?\nPAULA: Try to get some rest. Now, Peri, are you all right?\nPERI: I’m fine, thank you. I should try to find the Doctor.\nPAULA: But I thought... Oh. You mean your friend the Doctor. So, you two are from the colonist’s shuttle, then.\nPERI: Not exactly.\nPAULA: Oh. I knew I hadn’t heard it land. Well, in that case, I don’t mean to be rude but... who the hell are you?\nPERI: We're just travellers.\nSHREENI: Well, you saved my life, so I won’t be asking any questions.\nPAULA: I thought I told you to get some rest. Looking at you, you’re not from Earth Authority, that’s for sure. You lack the aura of crushing negativity and pessimism.\nPERI: Honestly, we just landed here by mistake. Why would we be from Earth Authority anyway? Are you expecting a visit?\nPAULA: I’m not, but I can’t help feeling that Hector is. He’s playing with fire. One day someone’s going to show up from Earth and pull the rug right out from under him.\nPERI: I don’t understand.\nSHREENI: Can't say I do, either.\nPAULA: Well, there’s a surprise. Peri, why don’t we let the Sergeant here get some rest while we have a little chat over there.\nSHREENI: Oh, I get it. Not for the ears of the squaddies, eh?\nPAULA: I think Hector’s using the outpost as an excuse to develop the Exotrons beyond what was originally intended. Oh, he says it’s all to protect us, but you’ve been among the Farakosh yourself. It’s clear they've got no intention of attacking us provided we leave them alone.\nPERI: Well, you say the Farakosh aren’t a threat, and if the Exotrons are not to protect you, why is he building them? You think he’s testing the Exotrons for the army or something? A top secret kind of thing?\nPAULA: It’s worse than that. The outpost doesn’t get much funding from Earth. It’s part of the deal. The less funds an outpost commander needs, the greater the bonus for everyone when the first colonist’s shuttles arrive.\nPERI: So where’s Hector getting the money from? A private source?\nPAULA: Yes. Now that means he’s just going to sell the whole for profit at the end of the day. He'll sell to the highest bidder, and that won’t be Earth Authority. Hector, the intergalactic arms trader. I can’t believe he’s changed so much.\nPERI: Well, maybe he hasn’t. You don’t know for certain any of this is true. You said he tries to do nice things for you. He thought sending the Exotron to look after you was the right thing to do. Maybe he’s trying to make up for things.\nPAULA: He’s got nothing to make up for. It was me who had the affair.\nPERI: Oh.\nPAULA: Yeah. Hector’s the good guy.\nTAYLOR: Exotron, regroup with the rest of your unit. I command you to leave the geology block. Obey, Exotron! First you disregard my order to bring Paula to me and now you won't leave her side. It’s as if... It’s you, isn’t it? I can feel it. Three, I Know what you’re doing, but you are mine to command. Do you hear me? You are mine to command! No!\nPAULA: His name was Christian. He died. He’s dead six months ago.\nPERI: I’m sorry.\nPAULA: So am I. He was a Lieutenant. I seem to like soldiers. He was killed by a Farakosh.\nPERI: But I thought you said the animals were harmless, that they didn’t attack humans.\nPAULA: It was Christian’s fault. He was your typical military type, but gentle with it. Anyway, they’re not animals in the pejorative sense. I think they're possessed of reasoning minds. I swear I can see them communicating sometimes.\nPERI: All animals communicate, don’t they?\nPAULA: Well, yes, but the Farakosh, they... listen to each other, but they don’t make a sound. At least, not one that I can hear.\nPERI: So what exactly is it you do out there? Aside from listening for sounds that aren’t there.\nPAULA: We take sonic readings to measure the strata, classify its composition. It’s not really looked on as serious work by the military, but they have to put up with us because it’s part of the colonisation regulations.\nPERI: You use sonics? Some insects communicate like that, through vibrations. Maybe that’s what the Farakosh are listening for.\nPAULA: The Farakosh are mammals.\nPERI: They’re also aliens, to us, so what do we know.\nPAULA: You may be onto something. Maybe when we set up the rigs they think we’re trying to communicate with them.\nPERI: That would explain why they never attack you. You’re familiar, a face they’ve gotten used to, and a sound.\nPAULA: Good God. They think I’ve been trying to talk to them.\nPERI: What are you doing?\nPAULA: I’m taking a sounding rig out there.\nPERI: Sounding rig? Wait a minute. There must be hundreds of Farakosh out there by now.\nPAULA: I know. I’ve never seen this many. But if I can get through to them.\nPERI: With that sounding rig?\nPAULA: I can make them leave, stop them getting slaughtered by Hector’s machines.\nTANNOY: All personnel. All personnel. Fall back to the Central Net block. The Farakosh have breached the perimeter defences. Repeat, the Farakosh have breached the perimeter defences.\nPERI: Oh no.\nSHREENI: What're they playing at?\nPAULA: You should be lying down. I’ve patched you up, but I’m no doctor.\nPERI: The Doctor!\nPAULA: If you’re thinking of going over there, forget it. You'll never make it. There'll be far too many bullets flying around.\nPERI: No, I have to find the Doctor.\nPAULA: Okay, but I’ve got to go, but Shreeni will help you use the monitors here. They’re linked up all over the outpost. You can see exactly where he is first. Maybe he’s not in Central Net at all. Okay, Shreeni?\nSHREENI: Good as done.\nPERI: Good luck.\nPAULA: You too.\nPERI: Right then, Sergeant Shreeni, do your stuff.\nDOCTOR: So close. There must be another way in.\nPERI: [OC]: Doctor? Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Peri?\nPERI: [OC]: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Peri, long time no see. You look rather flushed.\nPERI: [OC]: So would you if you’d been chased by a couple of hundred giant hyenas.\nDOCTOR: But you’re somewhere safe now.\nPERI: [OC]: I’m fine. I’m with Sergeant Shreeni, the one at the pylon? He’s okay too. For a minute there I didn’t know if you were doing yoga or you’d died.\nDOCTOR: Simple telepathic trance. Nothing to worry about. This whole area is flooded with telepathic activity. It’s how the Exotrons communicate.\nPERI: [OC]: Hey, Paula thinks she knows how the Farakosh communicate. She’s gone outside to test her theory now.\nDOCTOR: Has she? And who’s Paula?\nPERI: [OC]: Oh, sorry. Head of the geology team. Major Taylor’s her ex-husband. He’s in command of the outpost.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’ve met our Major Taylor. In fact I need to have another word with him right now.\nPERI: [OC]: Be careful, Doctor. The Farakosh are inside the Central Net block, and all the Exotrons and soldiers are heading back there too. You're in the middle of a war.\nDOCTOR: Well, at least that means they’ll stop looking for me. Peri, from where you are, have you got access to all the security cameras in this block?\nPERI: [OC]: Hang on.\nSHREENI: [OC]: Hi, Doctor. Shreeni here. Yeah, I can access, well, any of the cameras you want.\nDOCTOR: Good. Give me two minutes to lash up a portable communicator from this console.\nSHREENI: [OC]: Two minutes? Oof, pretty impressive.\nDOCTOR: Peri, you and Shreeni are going to have to use the cameras to guide me along the best route back to Major Taylor’s office. Avoid the worst of the fighting.\nPERI: [OC]: Okay, we'll try.\nPAULA: It’s madness out here. This’ll have to do. Exotron, make yourself useful. Set the sounding rig down here. Come on, we haven't got much time. Your robot friends are murdering dozens of Farakosh by the minute.\nTAYLOR: Look at you, trying to impress her. You’re pathetic.\nPAULA: [OC]: Move that cable. Quickly.\nTAYLOR: Do you think she’d be prepared to stand next to you if she knew who you are, what you were? I’m the one that protects her, not you. Three, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Exotron.\nDOCTOR: Peri, can you hear me? Is this lash-up working?\nPERI: [OC]: Loud and clear, Doctor. And we’ve got you on camera. Turn right at the next junction.\nDOCTOR: Right. Are you sure?\nPERI: [OC]: No, wait!\nPERI: [OC]: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m all right, Peri. Wish I could say the same for that Farakosh. This is mass slaughter.\nPERI: [OC]: Doctor, now! Run to the right.\nDOCTOR: I’m on my way.\nPERI: Okay, Doctor. Stop at the next junction. Now, oh, er. Oh no.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: It’s all right, Peri. Stay calm. Now, which way?\nPERI: I don’t know. They’re everywhere. Sergeant?\nSHREENI: Bear with us, Doctor. We’re trying to find you a safe route. At least they’re not moving in your direction yet.\nPERI: Hold it. That’s Paula, isn’t it? Oh no.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Peri, fascinating though this audio commentary is\nPERI: Sorry, Doctor, it’s just that I can see Paula on another monitor. The Farakosh are moving towards her from almost every direction. I’ve got to go out and warn her.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Peri, no, you mustn't. It'll be too dangerous.\nPERI: The Exotrons seem to make the Farakosh angry.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: The Exotrons do?\nPERI: Yeah. And looks like she’s got one with her.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Wait a minute, let me get my bearings. Yes, I think I recognise this corridor. I was taken down here to the Major’s office. I think I can make my own way from here anyway.\nPERI: No, Doctor. You should just sit tight.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Seems we're both determined to take a risk, doesn’t it? Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.\nPERI: Well, you’d better be.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Same to you. Call me when you get back.\nSHREENI: Bit of a hero, your Doctor friend.\nPERI: I guess so.\nSHREENI: Listen, I can’t let you go out there alone.\nPERI: Who’s the hero now, Sergeant? Okay, let’s do this.\nSHREENI: And I thought I was going to have a dull day up a pylon.\nPAULA: Exotron, hold this connection for me. That should do it. What the hell? The colonist’s shuttle. Don’t land. Don’t land, you idiot. Can’t you see what’s happening?\nDOCTOR: Made it. Now for the inner sanctum. 72852. (door opens) Major Taylor. That wouldn’t by any chance be a cerebral link interface you’re hooked up to, would it?\nTAYLOR: Doctor. How did you know the door code?\nDOCTOR: Let’s just say I read your mind.\nSHREENI: Bleeding hell. What a time for the Earth shuttle to arrive.\nPERI: Oh no! Please don’t let us be too late. Come on!\nTAYLOR: Explain yourself, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: First things first. Unplug yourself from the Net so we can talk properly. Those intravenous implants must be causing you a great deal of pain, and they’re not doing my stomach much good either. Come on, unhook. What do you say?\nTAYLOR: I can’t, Doctor. If I lose concentration, the entire outpost will be overrun by the Farakosh. It is my will, and my will alone, that’s controlling the Exotron robots.\nDOCTOR: Yes, we’ve established that. Strange then that this chap in the corner seems completely inert. Perhaps he just needs waking up.\nTAYLOR: Stay away from there, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Afraid I'll rumble your little secret? What exactly is inside? Oh no.\nTAYLOR: I did warn you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s Weiss, the soldier that was electrocuted at the pylon. I thought she was dead.\nTAYLOR: To all intents and purposes she was dead, but an Exotron got there soon enough to revive the brain activity.\nDOCTOR: And then you had the body brought here to... to... These tubes. They're keeping her alive, aren't they? Preparing her.\nTAYLOR: You can’t even begin to understand the work I’m doing here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You’d be surprised, Major. You wouldn’t be the first grave robber I’ve encountered.\nTAYLOR: No, it’s not like that.\nDOCTOR: Then what is it like, Major? What do you do, trawl the Medical block, falsify death certificates? I doubt you ask for volunteers. I can’t imagine the process is painless.\nTAYLOR: How would you know anything about the process?\nDOCTOR: Because I broke into the Net, albeit for a brief moment. I’ve seen inside your mind, Taylor. That’s how I knew the door code to this chamber of horrors. And now I realise what you’re up to. The Exotrons are shells, they’re not robots. Fused inside each one is the body of a fatally wounded soldier. And there you keep them, in mortal agony. It’s obscene.\nTAYLOR: And what are you going to do to stop it, Doctor? Murder me? If you pull me bodily from the interface, you'll kill me, and I don’t think you’re that kind of man. Evidently you’re an accomplished telepath, Doctor, but you didn’t actually succeed in staying in the Net.\nDOCTOR: Then perhaps I can get into the Net another way.\nTAYLOR: There is no other way.

Now then, how do I get into this metal overcoat. Ah ha.\nPILOT: Shuttle down and locked off, sir.\nBALLANTYNE: I’m coming back to join the payload.

Is that you?\nDOCTOR: A Farakosh. I can hear the Farakosh.\nLIPTOYE: The Farakosh are in the Net with us. They are natural telepaths. The Exotrons enrage them because the white noise of the Exotron Net sears across their telepathic senses.\nDOCTOR: Peri was right. Every time the Exotrons are activated, it causes the Farakosh pain.\nLIPTOYE: The Farakosh only fight to try and stop the pain.\nDOCTOR: Did you know this, Taylor? Speak to me, Major.\nLIPTOYE: He does not hear you, but we do. All of us. We’ve been waiting for you, Doctor. Now it can begin.\nPERI: Paula, are you all right?\nPAULA: Peri, Shreeni, I thought you were looking for your friend.\nPERI: It’s okay, I found him.\nSHREENI: We’ve got to get out of here. There’s about half a dozen Farakosh heading this way.\nPAULA: Good. I’ve almost got the sounding rig set up.\nPERI: But with the Exotron here, the Farakosh are going to be provoked into attacking you, aren’t they?\nPAULA: You're right. Exotron, get out of here. Go back to the hangar and shut down, or something.\nPERI: It’s not going to leave you, Paula.\nSHREENI: Come on, maybe we can make it to the shuttle.\nPAULA: No. Peri, if you’re right and the Farakosh have been trying to communicate with me, then the sounding rig may be our only way to get through to them and stop this carnage.\nPERI: But I was only guessing. What if I’m wrong?\nPAULA: Now’s your chance to find out.\nDOCTOR: What can begin? Tell me.\nLIPTOYE: This living hell is a single consciousness, Doctor. Everything’s shared in here. Sight, knowledge, pain.\nDOCTOR: Of course. A telepathic gestalt. Stupid of me not to realise. I can feel it too. The communal awareness. Let me see now. You're Liptoye. Lieutenant Liptoye.\nLIPTOYE: Correct. You’ve got an extraordinary mind, Doctor. Profound, unique, strong. But it’ll only take a few moments for the Net to imprison it permanently. I have to push you out before the assimilation is complete. Before it’s too late.\nDOCTOR: No, wait, I’m here to help you. I think I can take control of the Net from Major Taylor.\nLIPTOYE: 1! don’t doubt it, but you don’t need to do anything, Doctor. The fact that a mind as individual as yours is here at all has been enough to disrupt the cerebral harmonics. It’s given us the strength we needed. I’ve been fighting against Major Taylor’s orders for a long time, and gaining a little ground with each attempt. When I learned why the Farakosh attack us, I was able to resist his orders to kill them. And now, thanks to you, I can feel myself becoming completely independent. I shall soon challenge him for control of the Exotron Net.\nDOCTOR: I... I can see my friend, Peri. That must be Paula with her.\nLIPTOYE: You're looking through my eyes. Or rather, those of the Exotron my body is rotting in. They’re both safe, Doctor. I’ve been looking after them.\nDOCTOR: You’re protecting them, yes. But it’s more than that. I can feel... Yes, it’s love.\nLIPTOYE: The Net is assimilating you, Doctor. You’re seeing too much.\nDOCTOR: You and Paula are in love. Does she know that that’s you, standing there with her?\nLIPTOYE: She thinks I’m dead, and that’s the way it has to stay. It would kill her to know what Hector’s done to me.\nDOCTOR: Lieutenant, I\nLIPTOYE: No, not Lieutenant, please. Not any more. My name is Christian. Now I must push you out of here, Doctor, before it’s too late.\nDOCTOR: Now wait, Christian. I want to...\nLIPTOYE: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Argh!\nDOCTOR: Hector. Hector!\nTAYLOR: Such pain. Such loss. I had no idea.\nDOCTOR: Hector, this has got to stop.\nPILOT: Squads Alpha and Omega are armed and ready to disembark the shuttle, Secretary Ballantyne.\nBALLANTYNE: Good. Deploy Alpha Squad with orders to proceed to the Central Net block on foot. You will pilot myself alone when they’re there. Land on the roof. Let’s see how surprised Major Taylor is to see me.\nPILOT: Sir.\nBALLANTYNE: Oh, and relay orders to kill anything that moves.\nPILOT: Sir.\nPAULA: Can you understand me, Farakosh?\nSHREENI: Hey, something’s happening with the colonist’s shuttle. Are they leaving?\nPERI: I don’t know, but the fighting’s stopped. Listen.\nPAULA: The rig’s communicating with you somehow, isn’t it?\nKUCHA: [OC]: Not communicating as such, but connecting.\nSHREENI: Eh? Who said that?\nPAULA: It wasn’t the Farakosh. I was watching it the whole time.\nPERI: The Exotron.\nKUCHA: [OC]: Not the Exotron, no. I was simply using its devices and the human voices in your Net to communicate with you in a way you will understand.\nPAULA: Are you a...\nKUCHA: [OC]: Yes. I am the Farakosh standing directly in front of you. My name is Kucha.\nSHREENI: Blimey.\nPAULA: Kucha. About what’s happening. I... I’m sorry.\nKUCHA: [OC]: We understand, Paula Taylor.\nSHREENI: Well, I don’t. How can you talk?\nKUCHA: [OC]: We can talk because Peri’s friend, the Doctor, has allowed someone else to control part of Major Taylor’s telepathic Net.\nPERI: That sounds like the Doctor.\nPAULA: And the reason you’re not attacking this Exotron, it’s got something to do with the sounding rig, hasn’t it?\nKUCHA: [OC]: The Exotron Net disrupts our natural telepathic field. The vibrations in your sonic device harmonise that disruption. Put simply, it stops the pain.\nPAULA: You were in pain? So that’s why you attacked.\nSHREENI: I don’t believe it. This is unbelievable. A talking dog?\nKUCHA: [OC]: As long as the sonic device is working, our species can live in peace.\nSOLDIER: (distant) Alpha Squad on the double. Move, move, move!\nPERI: Er, Paula? Didn’t you say there were supposed to be a lot of civilians in that shuttle?\nPAULA: What? Yes, it’s carrying the first Earth colonists. Workmen, families, farmers.\nPERI: They don’t look like farmers to me.\nSOLDIER: (distant) Fire at will!\nPERI: Paula, run!\nPAULA: Exotron, forget about me. Protect the sounding rig. The rig! Kucha, get away from here. Quick!\nPAULA: Kucha!\nSHREENI: Get down, you stupid bleeding great dog. Cease fire! Cease fire! Civilians present! I said cease fire! Argh!\nPAULA: Shreeni! Come on, Shreeni, breathe. Breathe. Look at me. Look at me. Come on.\nSHREENI: (weak) Quite a day, eh?\nPAULA: Shreeni? Shreeni! Shreeni!\nPERI: It’s no use, Paula. He’s dead. Kucha, I don’t know if you can understand me, but keep the Exotron between you and the soldiers. Now run! Right, let’s go.\nTAYLOR: Doctor, Earth Authority troops, they’re storming the compound. I’m trying to hold them off.\nDOCTOR: For pity’s sake, man, look at yourself. This is killing you.\nTAYLOR: Christian, protect her. Please.\nDOCTOR: If only to save your own life, Major, close down the Net.\nTAYLOR: She still loves him, Doctor, after all this time. She must be so sad. Oh, what have I done?\nDOCTOR: Taylor, you’ve created a self-sustaining circle of violence. You created your own enemy to fight.\nTAYLOR: It’s all my fault, Doctor. All my fault.\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: Hector. Can you hear me, Hector?\nTAYLOR: Ballantyne, is that you?\nBALLANTYNE: [OC]: I have come for the return on my investment, Hector.\nDOCTOR: Things are getting out of control, Major, but you can still stop all this.\nBALLANTYNE: Set us down on the roof, Pilot.\nPILOT: Sir.\nSOLDIER: [OC]: Alpha Squad to shuttle. Alpha Squad to shuttle. We’re being wiped out down here! It’s a slaughterhouse. Argh!\nBALLANTYNE: Let’s finish this.\nPERI: (breathless) Oh, do you reckon Kucha got away?\nPAULA: I didn’t see it. Shreeni saved her life, though.\nPERI: Oh, this is all just so senseless! With the sounding rig gone, there’s nothing to calm the Farakosh down. Who are those idiots?\nPAULA: It’s what I was worried about. Earth Authority has come to take the Exotron Project from Hector. They must have used the colonist’s shuttle as a cover.\nPERI: Do you think Hector knew about the pain he was causing the Farakosh?\nPAULA: No. He’s obsessive, but he’s not cruel.\nPERI: What did the Farakosh mean about human voices in the Exotron Net?\nPAULA: I don’t know. Come on, we have to follow those Earth Authority barbarians to the Central Net block. We've got to find Hector. And you can get out of my way as well, you metal freak!\nPILOT: Which way, Secretary Ballantyne?\nBALLANTYNE: Over there, behind the processing tower. Come on. We can reach Taylor’s office from the northern stairwell. We’ll take the men down there and...\nPILOT: Sir. The southern stairwell.\nSOLDIER: (distant) Open fire! There’s another one. Come on, cut it off.\nBALLANTYNE: Cover me while I get this door open.\nPILOT: Sir.\nPILOT: Sir? The door’s locked! Sir? Secretary Ballantyne!\nTAYLOR: Christian? I don’t have much strength left. Take control of some Exotrons and direct them to the roof. Assist the Farakosh against the Earth Authority troops.\nLIPTOYE: I'll send unit seven up there.\nTAYLOR: And Christian? Thank you for looking after Paula.\nLIPTOYE: Hang on, Hector. I’m on my way to you.\nTAYLOR: Doctor, help me get free of this thing.\nDOCTOR: With pleasure. Careful. Don’t try to stand.\nTAYLOR: I heard you and Christian in the Net, Doctor. I had no idea about the Farakosh.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’ve disconnected it now, which means the Exotrons will be shutting down all over the outpost. That will stop the Farakosh’s pain. You’ve done the right thing, Major.\nPERI: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Peri. You were careful, then.\nPERI: We had the Exotron to protect us.\nDOCTOR: Yes, so you did.\nPAULA: Finally doing the thing it was designed for.\nDOCTOR: And you must be Paula.\nPAULA: I am. Now where’s that ex-husband of mine. Hector?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. You’d better prepare yourself for the worst.\nPAULA: Worst? What are you talking about? Hector?\nTAYLOR: Paula.\nPAULA: I’m here, Hector. By God, what’s happened to you?\nTAYLOR: Paula, you were right about the Exotrons. About everything. I just didn’t understand. I didn’t understand.\nPAULA: You made a mistake. People do, sweetheart.\nTAYLOR: I made more than one mistake. I wasn’t a good husband, Paula. You didn’t deserve that. I wish I had been a good husband to you.\nPAULA: You were, Hector, at the beginning.\nTAYLOR: Really?\nPAULA: Well, somewhere in the middle, at least.\nTAYLOR: Ah yes, somewhere in the middle.\nPAULA: I wasn’t a good wife, Hector. Not in the end.\nTAYLOR: No, you weren’t, were you.\nTAYLOR: And I’m glad you’re here, Paula.\nPAULA: I know. Hector. Hector?\nPERI: Paula, I’m so\nBALLANTYNE: Well, this is all very touching, I must say.\nPAULA: And who the hell are you supposed to be?\nBALLANTYNE: Ballantyne, Secretary of the Interior and one-time business partner of oh. The dear departed. You’ve caused me a lot of problems, ex-Mrs Taylor.\nPERI: Listen, you murdering money-grabbing\nDOCTOR: Quiet, Peri. He’s armed, and at a guess unrestrained by morals.\nBALLANTYNE: As soon as you left Hector he started going to pieces. That put our project at risk, and I couldn’t have that, so I had to make plans to come here and relieve him of the responsibility, shall we say.\nDOCTOR: Doesn't seem to have gone all that well, though, does it, Mister Secretary of the Interior. Especially since I’m about to dismantle the Net apparatus. (gunshot) Ow!\nBALLANTYNE: I'd stay away from there if I were you. I take it you’re this Doctor that Taylor was so frightened of. Can’t really see what all the fuss was about. Oh, and on the contrary, it’s gone exceedingly well.\nPAULA: What are you doing? That’s Hector’s research.\nBALLANTYNE: Which I paid for. Once I’ve downloaded it I intend to sell it for a fortune to the military. And now I don’t even have to kill old Hector there before I do it.\nPAULA: I'll destroy the outpost before I let you do that.\nBALLANTYNE: Oh, I intend to do that anyway. I have all the self-destruct codes.\nLIPTOYE: Stop.\nBALLANTYNE: What? I thought all the Exotrons had shut down. No matter. Once I have what I\nBALLANTYNE: Exotron, I command you to cease! At once! The research!\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re welcome to the hard drives, Secretary.\nPERI: If you can find all the bits.\nBALLANTYNE: You fools. You think that’ll stop me? All I need is a working Exotron, and they can dismantle it if they want to know how it works. But first I think I'll remove the witnesses.\nDOCTOR: Get his gun, would you, Peri?\nPERI: Sure thing, Doctor.\nLIPTOYE: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well done, Lieutenant.\nPAULA: Wait a minute, I know that voice. But it can’t be. You’re dead.\nLIPTOYE: There’s no easy way to say this, Paula.\nPAULA: Christian?\nPERI: Christian! Kucha said something about human voices in the Exotron Net. Does that mean he’s alive, trapped inside there?\nBALLANTYNE: Alive, no. We merely needed his neural network. That Lieutenant’s dead, rotting flesh.\nPERI: Don’t move, you. I... I’m not afraid to use this.\nPAULA: Christian, is it...?\nLIPTOYE: Paula.\nPAULA: I loved you.\nPERI: Doctor. Ballantyne!\nBALLANTYNE: Get off, girl.\nDOCTOR: Peri, stop him!\nBALLANTYNE: Too late, Doctor. This place is about to go sky-high. Best of luck.\nPERI: Doctor, should we go after him?\nDOCTOR: No, leave him. I can’t deactivate it. Christian, can you do anything?\nLIPTOYE: Not directly, Doctor, but there is one thing.\nPAULA: Christian, what are you going to do?\nLIPTOYE: I can control the Net now, Paula. I’ve summoned the others here. Together we can smother the blast, localise it to this lab. The outpost will be saved and you'll have enough time to get the survivors clear.\nPAULA: Christian, no!\nDOCTOR: Christian, it was Major Taylor’s manipulation of the Net that caused you and the Farakosh so much pain. If all the Exotrons have independence, that manipulation won't exist. You can live here peacefully with the Farakosh.\nLIPTOYE: We know that, Doctor, and the Farakosh would welcome us. But being mostly machine is no kind of a life.\nDOCTOR: There must be another way.\nLIPTOYE: You know there isn’t, Doctor.\nPAULA: Christian, I’ve just found out you’re alive. I can’t lose you again. You can’t sacrifice yourself.\nLIPTOYE: I’m not alive, not really. I’m sorry, Paula. And I’m sorry about Hector.\nPAULA: Don’t do it, please.\nLIPTOYE: I just wanted to tell you one more time, I love you. Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Paula. We have to go. Make sure everyone evacuates the outpost. Christian, you’re a very brave man.\nPAULA: No! (crying) No.\nPERI: Paula, come on.\nLIPTOYE: Goodbye.\nPERI: Doctor, most of these people are wounded. We should rest.\nDOCTOR: All right. I reckon we’re far enough from the outpost now. Send the word around, would you, Peri?\nPERI: Sure. Okay, everyone. We’re going to stop here. The Doctor says we’ve come far enough.\nPAULA: We shouldn’t have left him. Them.\nDOCTOR: It was their choice, Paula. There was no changing his mind, believe me. I could see into it.\nPAULA: Ballantyne got away.\nDOCTOR: Physically, maybe, but I’d say his career is over. This isn’t the kind of thing he’ll be able to cover up. He’ll be hounded from office.\nLIPTOYE: [OC]: Paula. Paula?\nPAULA: (thinking) Christian? Christian, is that you?\nCOMPUTER: Self-destruct in ten, nine\nLIPTOYE: Farewell, my love. I’m glad we got to see each other again.\nPAULA: So am I. Farewell.\nCOMPUTER: Two, one.\nPAULA: He’s gone. I spoke to him. We said goodbye. It was as if he was inside my head.\nDOCTOR: I know. It’s all right.\nPAULA: Is it? No one really understood anybody else. We had no idea the Farakosh were trying to communicate with us. Hector and I couldn’t tell each other what we needed when we were married.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, er.\nPERI: Doctor, we’ve got company.\nKUCHA: Paula Taylor, we are glad you are still alive.\nPAULA: Kucha! I’m glad you're alive too.\nDOCTOR: Hello, I’m the Doctor, and, well, you already know all that, don’t you.\nKUCHA: It is good to meet you, Doctor.\nPERI: It’s all over, Kucha. No more Exotron Net. No more Exotrons.\nKUCHA: We know. We are here to mourn the dead of both races.\nDOCTOR: As are we.\nKUCHA: And then, Paula, we shall help you to rebuild.\nPAULA: Yes. No more misunderstanding.\nDOCTOR: They will be remembered.\nDOCTOR: Urban Myths, by Paul Sutton\nDOCTOR: A Big Finish Productions Dr Who Audio Drama, released May 2007\nEDGE: Look, can we all just agree on this once and for all. The Doctor must die.\nKETTOO: (a woman) Keep your voice down, for Rassilon’s sake. We’re supposed to be blending in with these humans.\nHAROM: The Doctor won’t be the only one to die. I’m going to waste away if that waitress doesn’t get a move on with our appetisers. Oh, I knew it boded ill wnen she suggested a Montrachet to accompany the goulash.\nKETTOO: Is goulash a local speciality, sir?\nHAROM: Oh, yes, yes, it is, it is. In fact, despite its popularity throughout the universe, goulash actually originated in this particular part of planet Earth.\nEDGE: I’m sorry, sir, but I really... How about steak? Is that a local speciality too?\nKETTOO: As if you’d even notice, Edge. Wherever you go in the galaxy, you always order the same thing. Steak and chips.\nEDGE: I know what I like, and I like what I know.\nKETTOO: You have no appreciation when it comes to food.\nHAROM: Edge, we are all agreed that the Doctor is guilty, but killing him is outside Inquisitor Oron’s brief.\nEDGE: Then we should exceed the brief. What are we, CIA or Time Tots?\nHAROM: You would do well to remember to whom you are talking, Commander.\nEDGE: I’m sorry, Coordinator Harom, but surely the Doctor’s actions warrant the severest punishment.\nKETTOO: I have to say, I agree with Edge. The atrocities performed by the Doctor on planet Poytee are almost unparalleled.\nHAROM: Right, right, right, right, right, right. So we kill the Doctor. Anything for a quiet life.\nEDGE: Okay. When’s he going to get here?\nHAROM: Oh, your guess is as good as mine. Inquisitor Oron interprets the Doctor’s time signature as indicating he should be putting in an appearance some time this evening, though more than that it’s impossible to say. But all we need to is wait for him. Quietly. Ah, here comes the waitress.\nPERI: Your appetisers, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Chef’s in one of his fiddling moods. Keeps adding a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Consommé?\nHAROM: Oh, that’s mine. Er, er, dear.\nEDGE: Yes, yes, just put them down and disappear.\nPERI: Sorry, sir.\nKETTOO: Edge! I do apologise for my friend. He’s had a long day in the... office. We all work in an office, you see. The same office, in fact. Yes. Just your ordinary office. Yes, and we blend right into it.\nHAROM: Oh, give me strength.\nPERI: That’s okay. We get all sorts in here. Sometimes the customers are so weird it’s like they're from a different planet. Bon appetit.\nEDGE: What did she mean by that?\nHAROM: Oh, nothing, nothing. She didn’t mean anything by it at all. Now just eat your boring melon balls and act like everyone else.\nKETTOO: Mmm. Anyone want to try my fruits de mer medley? It really is exquisite.\nEDGE: I’m surprised any of us has the stomach to eat, when you think what the Doctor and his associate did on Poytee.\nHAROM: We all know what happened, thank you, Edge.\nEDGE: Well, perhaps some of you need reminding. Or maybe I just remember it differently. As far as I recall, from the very second they arrived on that lawless blot on the galactic landscape, the Doctor took it upon himself to be judge, jury and executioner.\nPERI: It’s just like you said it'd be, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Peri.\nDOCTOR: The planet Poytee. It’s entire surface just a single, moral-less conurbation.\nPERI: They’re killing each other on the streets.\nDOCTOR: That’s just what I mean. This place has always had the reputation of being an insidious little hole, but at this point in its history its people have reached the height of their cruelties to one another.\nMAN: No, please, argh! (laser fire) Argh!\nPERI: No kidding.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t worry. Whoever he was, he probably deserved it.\nPERI: Doctor, look out! It’s coming straight for us!\nDOCTOR: Are you okay, Peri?\nPERI: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Right. Those street brats aren’t going to get away with that.\nPERI: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Tardis armoury. (door opens) I keep a stash of weapons in a secret compartment under the console. (inside) Ah ha! (door closes)\nPERI: They must be half a dozen blocks away already.\nDOCTOR: Well, they won't be able to outrun this little baby. Let’s see if I can remember the priming sequence. Just keep the back of it steady for me, will you, Peri? (hum of device powering up) My shoulder can't take the whole weight.\nPERI: I’m not surprised. Got it.\nDOCTOR: Right then. Let’s see them laugh this off.\nPERI: Whoa!\nDOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on.\nDOCTOR: Got him!\nPERI: Great shot, Doc.\nDOCTOR: Excellent weapon. Must pop to Earth and give a consignment to the Brigadier.\nPERI: So, where are we now?\nDOCTOR: Now, Peri, we sort this planet out. These people have to be taught a lesson.\nPERI: And you’re just the Time Lord to do it.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Here, I got us another toy each from the armoury. Careful where you point it.\nPERI: Gee, thanks.\nDOCTOR: Now I'd say we'll find who and what we’re looking for in the penthouse of that tower. Come on.\nPERI: Right behind ya.\nPALGRAVE: What am I going to do? What am I going to do? Ah!\nPERI: Who needs door codes when you’ve got one of these.\nPALGRAVE: Who... who are you people?\nDOCTOR: Are you Planetary Coordinator Palgrave?\nPALGRAVE: How did you get past security?\nPERI: You wouldn’t believe what level three on these pistols does to a humanoid body.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t answer my question. Are you Palgrave?\nPALGRAVE: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nPERI: Ha! Right between the eyes.\nDOCTOR: Now then.\nPERI: Can you really access anything on the entire planet from here?\nDOCTOR: Absolutely anything, including the global network of subsurface atomic generators which I’ve just set to overload. Irreversibly so. The fireworks should start any minute... now.\nDOCTOR: Miss Brown, I think our work here is done, and we should have just enough time to get back to the Tardis before Poytee’s upper mantle ruptures and the surface of the planet becomes awash with cleansing lava.\nPERI: After you then, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Last one back has to get the blood out of my shirt.\nPERI: Hey, that’s not fair.\nKETTOO: Last one back has to get the blood out of my shirt? You know, I thought that was the way it happened, but, well, now you tell it again, I don’t know. It doesn’t seem very characteristic of the Doctor. What do you think, Coordinator Harom?\nHAROM: Are you sure you got that all right, Commander Edge? I mean, we know the Doctor is a subversive, but somehow I...\nEDGE: Now I think about it, it does seem a bit... extreme, doesn’t it?\nPERI: How did you enjoy your appetisers, gentlemen?\nHAROM: Hmm? Oh. Oh, very nice. Very nice, thank you. An interesting aftertaste with the consommé, though. Bit of cognac, perhaps? Or Amontillado?\nPERI: I really couldn't say, sir. It’s secrets of the profession. You understand.\nHAROM: Oh, of course, of course. Crass of me. Anyway, it was delicious.\nEDGE: Surprised it tasted of anything. It looked like warm water to me.\nPERI: I'll certainly pass on your compliments. Now, er, goulash?\nHAROM: Ah, here.\nPERI: Sole.\nKETTOO: Thank you.\nPERI: And for you, bifteck avec pommes frites.\nEDGE: Bif what? I ordered steak and\nPERI: Steak and chips. Enjoy your meal.\nHAROM: Hmm. Curious girl. Anyway, back to the business of the Doctor. If that is not what happened, then what did?\nKETTOO: I think...\nHAROM: Yes?\nKETTOO: I think this fish is quite the best I’ve ever tasted. Mmm mmm.\nEDGE: They'd never put up with this kind of thing in the Chancellery Guard.\nKETTOO: All right, misery guts. I think I do Know where your story became a little... exaggerated, though. The Doctor and his companion did land on Poytee amid the chaos of what seemed like a global riot. But I think his cruelty was actually prompted by some kind of twisted desire to help.\nPERI: It’s just like you said it'd be, Doctor. Poor people, to live like this.\nDOCTOR: Indeed, Peri. Poytee’s entire surface was terraformed as a single conurbation. It can produce some unique pressures.\nPERI: You're not kidding.\nDOCTOR: I’ve never known it to be as bad as this, though. Something must have happened.\nPERI: Doctor, look out! It’s coming straight for us!\nDOCTOR: Are you all right, Peri?\nPERI: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Right, now where did I put... ah ha. Those street rats aren’t going to get away with that.\nPERI: Do you ever go anywhere without a cricket ball?\nDOCTOR: Let’s see what they make of my googly.\nDOCTOR: Howzat!\nPERI: Must have hit the driver.\nDOCTOR: I once bowled WC Grace for a duck, you know. Or was that WC Fields?\nPERI: So where now, Babe Ruth?\nDOCTOR: I want to know what’s going on here, and I’d say we'll find that out in the penthouse of that tower. Come on.\nPERI: Right behind you.\nPALGRAVE: There must be some way to control this. People are dying.\nTROOPER: Planetary Commander Palgrave?\nPALGRAVE: Yes, trooper. Who are these people?\nDOCTOR: Hello. I’m the Doctor and this is\nTROOPER: Quiet. Sorry, sir. We captured them on level fifteen. Said they had to speak to you urgently. According to the bioscan they’re not infected so I\nPERI: Infected?\nDOCTOR: So that’s what’s going on.\nPALGRAVE: Thank you, Trooper. Wait outside a moment, would you?\nTROOPER: Sir.\nPERI: So a whole population has been infected by some kind of frenzy-inducing virus?\nPALGRAVE: Well, not exactly. What do you think you’re doing with that control panel?\nDOCTOR: I need access to the chain of subsurface atomic reactors.\nPALGRAVE: Now wait a minute.\nDOCTOR: Palgrave, do you want to save your planet or not?\nPALGRAVE: What do you intend to do?\nDOCTOR: Vent the cooling systems of each and every reactor on Poytee through their outlet pipes and into the seas.\nPALGRAVE: But the coolant will react with the hydrogen molecules and create an enormous radioactive gas cloud! It'll rise over the oceans and suffocate the planet! Every living thing will die.\nDOCTOR: Rather that than allow the virus or whatever is causing this frenzy among your people to leave Poytee and spread throughout the known galaxy.\nPALGRAVE: But it’s genocide!\nPERI: Just the lesser of two evils. We have to make these kinds of choices all the time.\nPALGRAVE: I simply won't let you do it.\nDOCTOR: Look, I don’t like it any more than you do, but if you don’t allow me to complete this code sequence, I'll\nPALGRAVE: No. (weapon readied) Step away from the control panel, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, really.\nPALGRAVE: Doctor, I won't tell you again. Step away from...\nPERI: Shame about the vase.\nDOCTOR: Well done.\nPERI: Right then, everything set to vent?\nDOCTOR: Irreversibly so.\nPERI: And there really was no other way?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not, Peri\nPERI: Then we'd better get out of here. After you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: When we get back to the Tardis, I think we should observe a moment's silence for the dead.\nPERI: Hmm. I'll make you a cup of tea.\nHAROM: Well, that sounds closer to the mark, Kettoo, but there’s still something that doesn’t add up.\nEDGE: Strange, isn’t it? Somehow it still doesn’t seem credible. Somehow.\nKETTOO: When I started telling it, I felt so sure that... But even before I'd finished I’d begun to doubt it.\nHAROM: Now wait a minute. What exactly is going on here? We’re supposed to be the Celestial Intervention Agency’s top team, but we can’t even get our story straight.\nPERI: Everything okay, gentlemen?\nKETTOO: Yes, yes, thank you. Nothing to worry about or be suspicious of. No, no.\nHAROM: Oh, I despair. I really do.\nEDGE: Ah ha! Is that my ice cream?\nPERI: There you go, sir.\nHAROM: Not having jelly with that, Edge?\nEDGE: Sorry?\nPERI: Iced berries with hot white chocolate sauce?\nHAROM: Mmn,, thank you.\nPERI: So the panna cotta must be you, madam.\nKETTOO: Ooo, indeed, indeed. Oh, that looks exciting. What's this sprinkled on the top? Nutmeg?\nPERI: There’s nutmeg involved, yes. Plus a little something else to give it a kick.\nKETTOO: Ooo, intriguing.\nPERI: Enjoy.\nHAROM: Look, Kettoo, speaking of giving things a kick, I’m afraid you may be exaggerating a little in your account of the events of Poytee. That’s not the way I remember it.\nEDGE: The Doctor’s still guilty, correct?\nKETTOO: Of course he is. We wouldn't be here otherwise.\nEDGE: Good.\nKETTOO: Go on, Coordinator. What’s your version of the Poytee incident?\nHAROM: Well, if it happened the way I’m beginning to remember it.\nWOMAN: [OC]: Science Corps to Planetary Commander Palgrave.\nHAROM: The Doctor and his companion landed on Poytee.\nWOMAN: [OC]: This is the Science Corps to Planetary Commander Palgrave!\nHAROM: And I think there was something about an infection. But how the Doctor dealt with it, I can’t quite recall.\nPERI: Hey! High tech. Cool.\nDOCTOR: Now don’t touch anything, Peri. We’ve no idea where we are and what any of this does.\nWOMAN: [OC]: Science Corps to Planetary Commander Palgrave.\nPERI: Well, this is acomms unit and... Doctor, the... the monitor. What’s happening out there? They looked possessed.\nDOCTOR: Some kind of mass hysteria. I wonder what can be causing that?\nPALGRAVE: At last.\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello. I’m the\nWOMAN: [OC]: Science Corps to Planetary Commander Palgrave.\nPALGRAVE: Just a minute, please. Science Corps, this is Palgrave. All under control. I’ve got your people here with me now. Palgrave out. Right then, what have you got for me?\nPERI: Got for you. Er...\nPALGRAVE: Look, I'll be honest with you. To a great extent, the exact cause of this illness is no longer relevant. I’m just praying you’ll debunk the necessity for the Corps’ latest plan to deal with it and come up with something less drastic.\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. How drastic is drastic? What are they... I mean, what do we in the Science Corps intend to do?\nPERI: They don’t tell us bods at the rock face anything.\nPALGRAVE: Your superiors have decided the only solution is to vent selective subsurface atomic generators. The Corps will control the spread of the resultant radioactive clouds using the climate modulator, then disperse them into the upper atmosphere when the situation has been dealt with.\nPERI: But Doctor, that’s mass murder.\nDOCTOR: It’s a quaint solution.\nPALGRAVE: And they want to implement it pretty much immediately.\nDOCTOR: Then I suggest I examine one of the victims right away.\nPALGRAVE: Good. We shall have to go down to level fifteen. Follow me.\nPERI: Is that the medical level?\nPALGRAVE: No, it’s the detention centre.\nDOCTOR: Then take us to the medical centre first. I need a syringe for a blood sample.\nPALGRAVE: Here we are, level fifteen.\nPERI: That noise. It’s horrible!\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is.\nPALGRAVE: This cell is as good as any.\nPERI: What’s she doing? What’s she doing to herself in there?\nPALGRAVE: There’s a monitor. I can...\nDOCTOR: Compulsive aggressive behaviour. She can’t control her own actions.\nPERI: Is she trying to get out?\nPALGRAVE: No, they’re all like that. Frenzied activity until they exhaust themselves into sleep, then it all starts again.\nPERI: Can you help her, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I'll need a blood sample. I can’t get that from out here. Palgrave, the door, if you’d be so kind.\nPALGRAVE: Of course.\nPERI: But Doctor, what about the risk of infection?\nDOCTOR: Just close this behind me, quickly.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Hello. I’m the Doc...\nPERI: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [OC]: It’s all right, it’s all right. I’m all right.\nPALGRAVE: I’m coming in, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: No, it’s okay. Open the door and stand back.\nDOCTOR: I’ve got everything I need.\nPERI: You’ve got the blood sample already?\nDOCTOR: Well, in a manner of speaking, yes. Our poor friend there broke the syringe when she attacked me, but I know what the condition is now. The eyes are unmistakeable. It’s a variant of the Tuloz virus. Oh, and it’s passed on by physical contact, so I'd stand back if I were you.\nPERI: You’re infected! Oh Doctor, I warned you.\nDOCTOR: If we’re quick, Palgrave, I believe you mentioned something about a climate modulator.\nPALGRAVE: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Right. Peri, go with Palgrave. Together you’re going to have to persuade the Science Corps to stop their plans.\nPERI: Okay, but what do we tell them?\nDOCTOR: You’ll think of something. Palgrave, I'll need to you evacuate the lab for me so I can work in isolation.\nPALGRAVE: Yes, Doctor. If you wait here, I can get in touch with you on the wall communicator to tell you when it’s arranged\nDOCTOR: Good. Now hurry, both of you. We have a planet to save.\nEDGE: That’s it, Coordinator. That’s how it happened.\nKETTOO: Yes, I remember.\nHAROM: Funny, it all seems so obvious now.\nEDGE: The woman Peri persuaded the Science Corps to wait, while the Doctor synthesised an antidote from his own blood sample and shot it into the atmosphere.\nKETTOO: Where it was activated and dispersed across the planet using the climate modulator.\nHAROM: He saved all those lives.\nKETTOO: What in Rassilon’s name were we thinking before? Killing the Doctor?\nPERI: Ah, I see you’ve finished your dessert, gentlemen, madam. I hope everything was to your satisfaction, Coordinator Harom.\nHAROM: Oh yes, it was. Er, what did you just call me?\nPERI: If I could be permitted to introduce the chef.\nDOCTOR: Good evening. Always nice to meet members of the Celestial Intervention Agency. Well, I say always.\nHAROM: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: And this is my friend, Peri.\nEDGE: What’s going on here?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s quite simple. You see, in the course of gathering information from the planet Poytee for your report, you were all infected by a benign strain of the Tuloz virus.\nPERI: It causes the sufferer to make wildly exaggerated claims.\nDOCTOR: Very common among amateur fishermen here on Earth, I believe.\nPERI: (sotto) Not to say men in general.\nDOCTOR: Yes. This particular strain of Tuloz is effectively responsible for something known as the Urban Myth.\nPERI: A story that may have at one point been based on some small truth, that has since lost itself to the realms of fantasy and scaremongering.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nKETTOO: So we’re infected?\nHAROM: It would make sense.\nDOCTOR: Actually, not any more. The antidote which we served you slowly over each course of your meal here this evening, has neutralised it.\nPERI: So now you can remember what really happened on planet Poytee.\nDOCTOR: And will hopefully no longer want to kill me.\nEDGE: How did you know of our assignment?\nDOCTOR: Typical Time Lord bureaucracy, I’m afraid. In order to maintain a back-up copy for future reference, any top secret communiqué’s automatically routed via the nearest Type 40 to the incident in question. On this occasion that just happened to be my own Tardis. Once I’d intercepted the message, breaking the cypher was child’s play. Inquisitor Oron has a rather literal mind. Which reminds me, Peri.\nPERI: A little present for Inquisitor Oron, when you get back to Gallifrey.\nKETTOO: What is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, if you hurry, it'll be his dose of the antidote for the Tuloz virus.\nPERI: If you don't, it'll be cold cream of mushroom soup, congealed honey glazed tofu and a curdled tiramisu.\nHAROM: Right then, we’d better be off. Thank you, Doctor, er, Peri.\nEDGE: And er... sorry for the misunderstanding.\nKETTOO: Yes, quite. No hard feelings, eh?\nDOCTOR: None at all. Maybe you could put in a good word for me with the High Council.\nHAROM: Better get going, eh? Come along, you two. Goodbye, Doctor, Peri.\nPERI: Doctor, you weren’t trying to twist things to your advantage, were you? Currying favour with the Time Lords by buttering up members of the CIA? Careful not to over-egg the pudding.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Peri. I've done more than enough cooking today to last me a regeneration.\nPERI: Glad I won’t have to wear this uniform anymore.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Yes, well, I wouldn’t take it off just yet.\nPERI: Doctor? What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Well, in order to have free run of the kitchens this evening, I er...\nPERI: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The proprietor is an old friend of mine. Renegade Time Lord, as it happens. She’s had a restaurant on this spot since the time of the Hapsburgs. Fairly monotonous life, if you ask me, but she seems\nDOCTOR: to like it.\nPERI: Just tell me!\nDOCTOR: I said you’d stay on till the end of the week.\nMAN: Waitress!\nPERI: What? I’m not standing for that.\nDOCTOR: No choice, I’m afraid. That out of order walk in fridge at the back of the kitchen is actually her Tardis. She’d track you down in a trice.\nMAN: Waitress!\nDOCTOR: I'll be back for you on Sunday.\nPERI: Hey, come back here!\nDOCTOR: That’s the way the cookie crumbles, Peri.\nPERI: Doctor!\nMAN: Waitress!\nPERI: Oh, coming, sir."
