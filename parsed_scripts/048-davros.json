They cannot bring themselves to look at me, let alone kill me. They hesitate. They fear me. Even when I am like this, and they have their perfect, pure, strong bodies, they fear me. And well they should. Iam no longer like them. I am above them. I have the ultimate power — the power of life and death. This body... this is my dominion. Mine to command, no one else's. I can sense them out there in the corridor. Cowering, not daring to speak. They are the frail ones, they are the crippled. They are the ones without choice. They will die. They will lose this war, and they will die. I could join them in defeat and death. But if I survive, then something stronger will emerge, a new race, the supreme power in the universe. I will not press this switch, I will not cower, I will not die! I will not die! This is not the end: this is only the beginning! !",

It will be painless, they say. They tell me they know the pain I am in — as if they could! — and that just by pressing this switch, I will end that suffering forever. They say I should be the one to do it. But they are weak. They cannot bring themselves to look at me, let alone kill me. They hesitate. They fear me. Even when I am like this, and they have their perfect, pure, strong bodies, they fear me. And well they should. Iam no longer like them. I am above them. I have the ultimate power — the power of life and death. This body... this is my dominion. Mine to command, no one else's. I can sense them out there in the corridor. Cowering, not daring to speak. They are the frail ones, they are the crippled. They are the ones without choice. They will die. They will lose this war, and they will die. I could join them in defeat and death. But if I survive, then something stronger will emerge, a new race, the supreme power in the universe. I will not press this switch, I will not cower, I will not die! I will not die!

Engine noises, electronic bleeping — we're in a spaceship.\nBAYNES: Are you stalling for time? Are you?\nPILOT: No... no. It's just that I'm not sure how to open it. We weren't meant to unseal the vault in transit.\nPILOT: Electronic squawk.\nLORRAINE: (Quiet and distorted, coming in over an earpiece) You're behind schedule.\nBAYNES: I'm at the vault door, the pilot can't get it open.\nLORRAINE: (Quiet and distort) So there's a problem?\nBAYNES: There are no such things as problems, my dear, just potential solutions.\nLORRAINE: —= (Quiet and distort) How do you suggest we solve this potential solution, darling?\nBAYNES: Well — I could kill the pilot and find another member of the crew that can open the door.\nBAYNES: The PILOT yelps.\nBAYNES: But I've tried that a couple of times already and the ship only had a crew of three. need you to come over.\nLORRAINE: —= (Quiet and distort) I thought I was staying over here to watch out for patrol ships.\nBAYNES: Change of plan. Set the computer for automatic scan and bring me my blue holdall.\nLORRAINE: (Quiet and distort) I'm already in the docking tube.\nPILOT: Look — I know this freighter is registered to the Galactic Bank, but the cargo isn't money, or bonds or anything it's just a\nLORRAINE: Here.\nBAYNES: I didn't want to use explosives — we'll set the alarm beacon off. But we don't have any choice. Attach this to the locking mechanism.\nBAYNES: We hear clamping sounds thunking against the metal door. SFX: Small bang... then a heavy door whooshes open.\nLORRAINE: __ It worked!\nBAYNES: Careful, the vault may be booby-trapped.\nBAYNES: The voices echo now they're in a small vault.\nLORRAINE: __ No, they didn't think anyone could get this far. That's why there are no lights. Have you got a torch?\nBAYNES: Here. (Beat, then a grunt of surprise.)\nPILOT: I told you there was no treasure. Just that. A dead body.\nBAYNES: That's what separates people like us from people like\nBAYNES: you, pilot. You and the rest of the herd would look at this and see... nothing. We see an opportunity.\nLORRAINE: You do know who this is?\nPILOT: Yes... it's — (hesitates)\nLORRAINE: _ Hecan't even say the name. It's Davros, pilot. This is the body of Davros.\nPILOT: It doesn't matter who it was. He's no use to you dead.\nLORRAINE: __ A patrol ship just came into range. It's altering course and heading this way.\nBAYNES: We have to get moving. The body's light enough, I can move it on my own. I'll get it back to our ship.\nLORRAINE: ~— Wait! Don't take him out of his chair.\nBAYNES: He'll be a lot easier to move if I do.\nLORRAINE: Don't!\nBAYNES: All right.\nLORRAINE: _ When the patrol gets here, they'll be expecting to find a body in the vault — let's not disappoint them.\nBAYNES: Good point.\nPILOT: Wait, what are you doing? I could come with you. I... Abruptly cut off by a gunshot. Gut to:\nPILOT: SCENE 1.3 - PEACEFUL WOODLAND. Slow fade-up to: birdsong, we're in woodland, and we hear trudging feet.\nWILLIS: Here.\nKIM: We wait here? How long for? Willis, there could be patrols.\nWILLIS: This far from the Dome. Is that earpiece of yours even working?\nWILLIS: KIM The signal faded out about half an hour ago.\nWILLIS: There you are, then.\nKIM: You know for sure that there are no patrols?\nWILLIS: I’ve got level one access, remember?\nKIM: You have a press pass. It's not the same thing.\nWILLIS: Look around — there's no one here. No one for miles\nKIM: Including your friend. How is he supposed to land\nKIM: here anyway? There's not a clearing big enough. Look — he'll have been picked up by a patrol. They probably intercepted him the moment he\nKIM: entered the system. We have to get back before —\nDOCTOR: Boo! WILLIS and KIM jump out of their skins.\nWILLIS: Hell, Doctor, you frightened the life out of me. You're not due for another half an hour.\nDOCTOR: I... overestimated how long it would take the\nDOCTOR: TARDIS to get there. So I've been waiting around here for the best part of the morning.\nWILLIS: But the TARDIS is a time machine surely you ought to be able to —\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. Now — if I can sneak up on you then those guards young...\nKIM: ...Kim...\nDOCTOR: Kim. Hello Kim, I'm the Doctor. Well, those guards\nDOCTOR: young Kim was worrying about could sneak up on us. So, rather than criticise my driving, perhaps we should all get to a safe place, and then you can tell me why you sent me that message.\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 1.4 -—- BAYNES'S INTERCEPTOR.\nBAYNES: We've just entered home system. Dome control has switched us to automatic control for landing.\nLORRAINE: ~— What about that patrol ship?\nBAYNES: It didn't even see us. We're well out of its detector range, now.\nLORRAINE: I'm not sure it matters.\nLORRAINE: BAYNES Of course it matters.\nLORRAINE: _ The medical computers on this ship are some of the most sensitive instruments available.\nBAYNES: I know — I sell them, remember?\nLORRAINE: _ But I'm the one with a degree in space medicine. I'm the one that understands what their read-outs are telling me.\nBAYNES: And?\nBAYNES: LORRAINE And they're telling me that Davros is dead.\nBAYNES: A pause.\nBAYNES: Dead?\nLORRAINE: __ Look at him. He's dead. No respiration no cardiovascular activity, no brain activity.\nBAYNES: Then there's no hope?\nLORRAINE: _ This computer is good, but the facilities back home are far better. There could be a chance. We should never give up.\nBAYNES: I know. But if he's dead, what can we do?\nBAYNES: SCENE 1.5 — KALED CITY.\nBAYNES: Slow fade-up — to the ‘electronic heartbeat '. (This — and other flashbacks in this episode — are slightly distorted, echoey. DAVROS's life is flashing in front of him. He's clinging to life, and is delirious. In this scene the Kaled sounds a little like BAYNES — DAVROS's memories and his actual surroundings are blurred.)\nKALED: We can keep him alive. Kaled medical technology will sustain him for — well, at least as long as his natural life expectancy. He could very well become the first of our people for ten generations to die of old age. But should we? Have we the right? Look at it... him. Look at him.\nDAVROS: I can hear you.\nKALED: Davros. I... the sedatives weren't supposed to...\nDAVROS: You are talking to the Elite? They are here?\nKALED: There is a radio link to the Council Chamber. DAVROS And you are meeting to decide my fate.\nKALED: Davros, you are one of our greatest scientists, you —\nDAVROS: I am the greatest scientist. The greatest mind Skaro has ever known!\nKALED: No one doubts that, Davros. But the attack...\nDAVROS: What has been decided?\nKALED: You know the principles that built and sustained the\nKALED: Kaled Nation. Physical strength. Self-reliance. Genetic purity. And you know... you know what you have become.\nKALED: DAVROS The Elite have voted to have me destroyed.\nKALED: We... the Kaled people owe you a great debt, Davros.\nDAVROS: Tell me what has been decided.\nKALED: None of us can do it. If Davros is to die, it must be by\nKALED: his own hand. Here. It's a poison injector, it activates when you flick this switch. It will be painless.\nDAVROS: Thank you. You have been most generous.\nKALED: I... I'll wait outside. For an hour. Thank you Davros, for all you have done. Cut to:\nKALED: SCENE 1.6 —- PEACEFUL WOODLAND.\nDOCTOR: We can rest here. And you can tell me what's going\nDOCTOR: on.\nWILLIS: TAI are planning to close all the mines.\nDOCTOR: TAI?\nWILLIS: TransAlliedInc. One of the largest corporations in the galaxy. They have nearly twelve billion employees.\nDOCTOR: They must have the largest staff canteen in the universe.\nKIM: (Deadly serious) The workforce is spread over a hundred worlds, Doctor. But that Dome is their headquarters.\nDOCTOR: Dome? Oh yes. Impressive. However did I miss that? It must be a mile high.\nWILLIS: Two and a half, and there are as many level underground even before you reach the mines.\nWILLIS: KIM The Dome contains everything they need to run TAI — computers, communications, marketing, training facilities...\nWILLIS: WILLIS And in there, the decision has been made to close every mining colony.\nDOCTOR: Well... it's a human tragedy. But mass redundancy, labour relations... it's really not my field.\nKIM: It's the fate of twelve billion people. Whole\nKIM: communities — whole planets — will be devastated for generations. You must be able to do something.\nDOCTOR: Well... what reason did they give for closing them?\nWILLIS: They haven't made the announcement yet.\nDOCTOR: Then how — ?\nKIM: I work in the computer section. I discovered secret\nKIM: files, something from a focus group that someone forgot to erase. I've only told Willis — if the company knew I'd been speaking to a journalist —and he said we should contact you.\nWILLIS: I reported on that business on Stellastora, Doctor, I\nWILLIS: know what you did there. But I don't just want to file a report on this — I want someone to stop it.\nDOCTOR: Well, I'll see what I can do. Okay... let's think: are the mines profitable?\nKIM: Almost every one of them is, yes. There are only a handful that couldn't be run at a profit, if they invested in them, or replaced the local manager with someone better.\nWILLIS: It makes no sense.\nDOCTOR: No it doesn't. (Beat) Can you hear that?\nWILLIS: It's a ship!\nDOCTOR: It's coming in to land.\nWILLIS: It'll be heading for the Dome. That's ten miles away.\nDOCTOR: It's going to land a lot closer than that. Down!\nKIM: There's nowhere to land around here, it's going to —\nKIM: WILLIS The ground's opening up.\nDOCTOR: There's a concealed hangar. You didn't know about this?\nWILLIS: No.\nKIM: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: If it closes up we might never find our way in. Hurry! Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 1.7 - BAYNES'S INTERCEPTOR.\nBAYNES: Hangar control, we're inside. Shutting down engines.\nBAYNES: Seal the hangar. Medical team to docking port.\nLORRAINE: — Opening airlock. Where is that medical crew?\nBAYNES: I'll find them. Stay here with the... the patient. We hear him leave.\nLORRAINE: _ Don't worry, Davros. I'll keep you safe.\nLORRAINE: SCENE 1.8 - HANGAR.\nDOCTOR: I don't recognise the design, but it's human technology.\nWILLIS: It's a medium-range interceptor. Built for speed. It’ heavily armed.\nDOCTOR: I can see that — but no armour or defences to speak of.\nDOCTOR: Something you'd use for a quick raid, then an even quicker getaway.\nKIM: Why would pirates operate right under the noses of\nKIM: the TAI headquarters?\nDOCTOR: Quick! Behind here!\nWILLIS: Ow!\nDOCTOR: Shush!\nKIM: (Urgent whisper) You stood on his foot.\nDOCTOR: Will you two be quiet?\nBAYNES: Bring that over here. Quick march!\nKIM: I don't —\nDOCTOR: Shush! (Whispering) Kim, what do you see?\nKIM: That's Baynes.\nDOCTOR: Baynes?\nWILLIS: Arnold Baynes, the chief executive of TAI.\nKIM: My boss. He's one of the richest men in this half of the galaxy.\nKIM: DOCTOR An unlikely pirate. Who's he with?\nKIM: Baynes's wife is there, too. They've got an injured\nKIM: man... no... God... it's horrible.\nDOCTOR: Don't raise your voice\nKIM: It's a body. A mutilated body.\nDOCTOR: Let me have a look. (Beat, then a yell) DAVROS!\nWILLIS: Oh, no...\nDOCTOR: You there! You there! Do you have any idea who this is? Yes, you!\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR's heading away from us, towards BAYNES — he carries\nDOCTOR: on speaking over this.\nWILLIS: Quick, Kim: follow me.\nKIM: What about the Doctor?\nWILLIS: He can look after himself.\nDOCTOR: (Continued, getting closer to BAYNES — and us — again) What are you trying to do?\nBAYNES: What the — ? Hold your fire, men! (To LORRAINE)\nBAYNES: Get our guest to the medical centre. I'll deal with this.\nLORRAINE: _ Iwill.\nLORRAINE: arguing, but it's muffled. We're on the other side of the door.\nDOCTOR: No wonder you're keeping this secret — who else know Davros is here?\nBAYNES: Who are you?\nBAYNES: This side of the door.\nLORRAINE: _ It's allright. You're safe. You're safe.\nLORRAINE: SCENE 1.9 —- KALED CITY.\nKALED: (Distorted) Davros. Davros, can you hear me?\nDAVROS: That smell... I can smell...\nKALED: Don't exert yourself.\nDAVROS: What is wrong with my voice?\nKALED: Your larynx was damaged in the attack. We've replaced it.\nDAVROS: I remember the attack. I remember the explosion. KALED A Thal shell, packed with radioactive isotopes.\nDAVROS: I raised my hands to shield myself from the blast. A\nDAVROS: foolish instinct. And the light was so intense I saw the bones of my hands. And as the explosion hit me, I flexed my fingers just to see my skeleton moving. What is that smell? I feel... I don't...\nKALED: We've given you the most powerful sedatives we have Davros.\nDAVROS: I don't think they are working. What is that smell?\nKALED: It's your skin.\nDAVROS: My... skin...?\nKALED: You were badly burned. You were lucky to survive.\nKALED: No one else in that section did, and...\nDAVROS: No... one?\nKALED: No.\nDAVROS: Show me my face.\nKALED: That wouldn't be...\nDAVROS: Show me! Show me!\nKALED: Davros, you're in the best hands, now, the most skilled Kaled doctors are tending to you, and —\nDAVROS: You will show me!\nKALED: Very well. Here.\nDAVROS: I can't see. Move it down. Yes... I... no! No! No!!!!!\nDAVROS: screams. Merge with:\nDAVROS: SCENE 1.10 - HANGAR.\nBAYNES: I won't ask again: who are you?\nDOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.\nBAYNES: Your real name.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it doesn't matter. Do you know who that is you've brought here?\nBAYNES: Tell me.\nDOCTOR: That is Davros. You know who Davros is? What he's done?\nBAYNES: My wife is one of the... no, actually she is the foremost on the subject.\nDOCTOR: If she knows Davros, then she knows that he is one of the... no, actually he is the most evil being this galaxy has created.\nBAYNES: Are you always this melodramatic?\nDOCTOR: Where Davros is concerned, it's no exaggeration to say —\nBAYNES: How did you know that Davros would be coming here?\nDOCTOR: I... I didn't.\nBAYNES: You just happened to arrive here at the precise moment Davros came off the ship?\nDOCTOR: Mr Baynes. Wait. Baynes. So your wife is Professor L. R. S. Baynes? Teaches history at Dawkins College, Oxford?\nBAYNES: She's Professor Lorraine Baynes, yes. She's never\nBAYNES: taught at Oxford, though.\nDOCTOR: Not yet. But she wrote Dalek Genius and The Dark Side of Skaro?\nBAYNES: You seem remarkably well informed. You've read them, I take it?\nDOCTOR: I started them. The idea of reading two rather turgid volumes written by an apologist for the Daleks stuck in my craw. BAYNES The last person to make that sort of accusation lost a lot of money in the libel courts.\nDOCTOR: He was also speaking the truth. So, you're working with the Daleks, are you? Where are they, then?\nBAYNES: No, we are not! The Daleks haven't been active in this arm of the galaxy for a century. The last Dalek War saw to that.\nDOCTOR: Yet Davros is here.\nBAYNES: Davros is dead.\nDOCTOR: No.\nBAYNES: What you saw was a corpse.\nDOCTOR: Don't underestimate him. You're playing with fire. Where did you find him?\nBAYNES: Doctor, you're wasting my time. You're obviously lying.\nDOCTOR: I never lie, Mr Baynes. I'll ask you again — how did you find Davros?\nBAYNES: You're convinced he's alive. So's my wife. Do you think you could resuscitate him?\nBAYNES: DOCTOR Of course I could, I'm not some bumbling local quack who —\nBAYNES: The DOCTOR realises he's said too much.\nBAYNES: How? How would you bring him back?\nDOCTOR: I'm not saying.\nBAYNES: I thought doctors were meant to preserve life, any life.\nBAYNES: It doesn't matter who he is, he's a patient in need of care.\nDOCTOR: What you have at the moment is a corpse.\nBAYNES: You can change that.\nDOCTOR: If you know anything about that monster you've got in there, you know that given the chance he'd kill countless millions.\nBAYNES: If you really can revive him, we can make it worth your while.\nDOCTOR: ‘Worth my while’? This isn't about money. And if\nDOCTOR: Davros is dead there's no moral dilemma here, no life to save: he stays dead, and good riddance.\nBAYNES: Come with me.\nBAYNES: Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 1.11 - CORRIDOR.\nKIM: Where are we going?\nWILLIS: I don't know.\nWILLIS: KIM The hangar doors are closed. There may not be another way out.\nWILLIS: There must be. What's going on here?\nKIM: I've no idea.\nWILLIS: You work in the computer section of the Dome. You must have had some clue this existed.\nKIM: None of us ever leave the Dome. It's so large, there's no reason to.\nWILLIS: We've no idea how big this place is.\nKIM: Your friend was no help at all.\nKIM: WILLIS The Doctor found the hangar. I think he found me a story.\nKIM: Is that all you care about?\nWILLIS: No. Of course not. For one thing, I care about getting out of here alive.\nKIM: If I don't get back soon, I'll be missed. My work shift starts at two point five.\nWILLIS: I'll get you back.\nKIM: How?\nWILLIS: Well, I'm not sure about that bit, yet.\nWILLIS: Cut to:\nWILLIS: SCENE 1. 12 - MEDICAL CENTRE.\nLORRAINE: Can you hear me? (Beat) You're magnificent Davros. Everything I imagined. I've seen images, but they just aren't the same... even with you like this. We'll bring you back. I promise.\nLORRAINE: BAYNES In there.\nLORRAINE: You've brought him here?\nBAYNES: He says he's a doctor, and he can revive Davros.\nDOCTOR: I'm not going to. Look at him. He even looks evil.\nLORRAINE: — Youare bringing your own cultural biases into play here. You've been told he's evil, so he looks evil. That's what you were told at school, on the news channels — you can't be blamed for that — you've been conditioned into thinking that Davros and evil are\nLORRAINE: synonymous.\nDOCTOR: Trust me, that isn't it.\nBAYNES: He looks dead to me.\nLORRAINE: _ Heis. I'msorry...\nDOCTOR: What? But these instruments — (He shuts up)\nLORRAINE: What about them?\nBAYNES: Check.\nLORRAINE: _ There was nothing. Wait. The sensors are registering something. There is brain activity. Look.\nBAYNES: What am I looking at?\nDOCTOR: Signs of life.\nBAYNES: That doesn't even qualify as a glimmer. That amount of cerebral activity isn't anywhere near a legal definition of life.\nDOCTOR: Then it's one more law that Davros has broken. He's\nDOCTOR: alive. And do you know what's keeping him alive?\nLORRAINE: _ The chair. It was built by Davros himself — a magnificent achievement. It acts as an iron lung, a pacemaker for his heart, it performs dialysis. It monitors his body, coordinates the self- repair circuits.\nDOCTOR: It's not the chair.\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 1.13 —- KALED RUINS. Murky DAVROS POV scene, same heartbeat. SFX: Rubble shifts, then clatters down and we hear someone scrabbling around.\nKALED: WOMAN © (In radiation suit, so muffled) 'm through! Oh...\nKALED: (Very distorted) What can you see?\nKALED: WOMAN __ Nothing. Dust. Wait.\nKALED: WOMAN The radiation levels are off the scale.\nKALED: Very distorted) Your suit will protect you.\nKALED: WOMAN _ Not for long.\nKALED: I'm through. Ah! I've just stepped in —\nKALED: WOMAN _ What?\nKALED: It doesn't matter.\nKALED: WOMAN _ Look up — you can see the stars. We're thirty levels below ground here.\nKALED: —~\nKALED: KALED The Thals must have scored a direct hit. At least ten megatons.\nKALED: WOMAN __ Twelve, probably, or there would be more debris.\nKALED: Here's Tral Mekta. And that's Chief Scientist Rontral.\nKALED: WOMAN _ Cal Vergant. At least that's what the name badge says. And... here's Coordinator Davros. What's left of him.\nKALED: Gods... there's not much, is there?\nKALED: WOMAN _ They're all dead.\nKALED: We knew that.\nKALED: WOMAN _ There aren't any survivors.\nKALED: No. And our suits won't last much longer.\nDAVROS: (Very, very weak — and no electronic effect , true voice of DAVROS) Shan?\nKALED: WOMAN _ Did you say something?\nKALED: No.\nDAVROS: Shan?\nKALED: It's Davros.\nKALED: WOMAN _ Butit can't be.\nKALED: Help me move him.\nDAVROS: Where is Shan?\nKALED: What's he saying? Shan? Is that a woman's name?\nKALED: Davros, there are no women in here. Even if there were, everyone here is dead.\nDAVROS: (Under previous line) Get a medic. Fetch a —\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 1.14 -MEDICAL CENTRE.\nBAYNES: If it isn't the chair, then what — ?\nDOCTOR: Hatred, Mr Baynes. All-consuming hatred of everything that isn't like him.\nLORRAINE: Davros is unique.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Look, whatever you've got planned here you have to stop it. Just allow him to lapse back into suspended animation. Leave him.\nLORRAINE: ~~ Whoare you?\nDOCTOR: I am the —\nDAVROS: Doctor!\nDAVROS: There's as long a pause as we can get away with.\nDOCTOR: Davros.\nDAVROS: is catching his breath for the first time in decades, rasping — but it's too much: DAVROS screams.\nLORRAINE: — Quick, prepare sedatives, we need to stabilise him. Get me ten ccs of dexpanthenol and —\nDAVROS: No. No sedatives.\nLORRAINE: _ The pain...\nDAVROS: You think Iam unused to pain? Look at me!\nBAYNES: This is incredible. His heart just started, all by itself. Breathing normal. Brain activity approaching normal.\nDOCTOR: Stop it! You have to —\nBAYNES: Get away from him.\nDAVROS: Doctor?\nDAVROS: The DOCTOR and DAVROS are face to face, BAYNES and LORRAINE are further away.\nLORRAINE: __Life signs are strengthening, but still nominal.\nDAVROS: Are you going to kill me, Doctor? You'll never get a better chance.\nDOCTOR: Shut him down. End this now.\nDAVROS: You are weak. There's the switch. End my life. You,\nDAVROS: not them. Do your own dirty work. End my life if you have the stomach for it.\nDOCTOR: No....\nLORRAINE: __ Life signs nominal. He's stabilising.\nDAVROS: cackles. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 1.15 —- CORRIDOR.\nWILLIS: Did you recognise the name the Doctor shouted?\nKIM: When he saw that body? Davros?\nWILLIS: Yes. You've never heard it?\nKIM: No. Should I?\nWILLIS: You've heard of the Daleks. Davros is their creator. But he’s been dead for over a century.\nKIM: He looked it. Why would they bring him here?\nWILLIS: That's quite a relic. There's quite a market for it, isn't there?\nKIM: For what?\nWILLIS: Dalek regalia. My grandfather served in the Dalek\nWILLIS: Wars, and I had a fragment of casing he kept on the wall. It took his whole squad to destroy it, they all took a bit home. When he died, it was sold to collector for a small fortune.\nKIM: For a scrap of metal?\nWILLIS: Yeah. So imagine what the body of Davros would fetch.\nKIM: People would pay money for a dead body?\nWILLIS: Oh yes. It's illegal, of course. But that's all Baynes stands for — money.\nKIM: It's immoral. It's... horrible. (Beat) Wait.\nWILLIS: What?\nWILLIS: KIM The air. It's changed.\nWILLIS: What do you mean? Yes... you're right. There's a breeze.\nKIM: We've gone down a few levels, haven't we?\nWILLIS: Down a few, up a few. I think we're lower now than that hangar bay. I think there's machinery. Can you hear that?\nKIM: This way.\nKIM: over the next bit — it's still quite quiet at the end.\nWILLIS: Definitely machinery.\nKIM: I think you're right.\nWILLIS: Through here?\nKIM: Why not?\nKIM: deafening.\nWILLIS: It's a production line.\nWILLIS: KIM A big one. Fully automated.\nWILLIS: They take it in for a moment.\nKIM: What's it for, do you think?\nWILLIS: Some sort of heavy machinery. I think that's going to be a hydraulic arm.\nKIM: It's a robot... they're building an army of robots!\nKIM: Cut to:\nKIM: SCENE 1.16 - MEDICAL CENTRE.\nDAVROS: Who are you?\nBAYNES: I'm Arnold Baynes, this is my wife Lorraine.\nLORRAINE: Davros, it is a great honour.\nDAVROS: Who do you work for?\nBAYNES: I don't work for people. People work for me. I'm the owner and chief executive of TAI, TransAlliedInc.\nDAVROS: A... businessman?\nBAYNES: Precisely. And I have a business proposition for you. I want you to work for me.\nDAVROS: For you?\nDOCTOR: Mr Baynes, this is madness.\nBAYNES: You'd have the whole R&D department of TAI to use.\nBAYNES: You'd be able to green-light projects, you'd have a helicopter view of the whole company and you'll be able to go any blue-skies initiatives you want.\nDAVROS: Your words make no sense. Have you resurrected me just to gibber at me?\nBAYNES: I can make you rich, Davros.\nDAVROS: Rich?\nBAYNES: If you worked for me, the sky would be the limit.\nDAVROS: I do not understand what is being offered — or expected of me.\nDAVROS: BAYNES The human race has come to dominate this galaxy.\nDAVROS: We’ve colonised sixty per cent of the habitable worlds and we're within a century of taking the rest. After that... what?\nDAVROS: There are other galaxies.\nDOCTOR: It takes an incredible technology to cross a galaxy but to travel between galaxies is a whole different order of problem.\nBAYNES: Exactly. And human technology, as it stands, just isn't up to it. And we humans consume, we expand — the galaxy is a big place, but we'll exhaust, 1t Within a matter of generations. But colonising other galax les — we’d need much better computers just to begin planning that.\nBAYNES: DAVROS And you require my help? Why should I assist you?\nBAYNES: Well, I'll introduce you to TAI, and you'll see we're on the level. I think the best thing to do first is play this.\nBAYNES: Perhaps overlapping with next line to emphasise it's a recording. There's some uplifting music under this.\nBAYNES: (V.O. in best voiceover voice) — TransAlliedInc is a good old-fashioned family mega-corporation. Started back in the thirty- eighth century by Elias Baynes as a simple robot manufacturers TAI has gradually expanded by giving its customers what they want — which isn't as easy as it sounds in today's diverse galactic marketplace. Our secret is to anticipate demand, to be at the forefront of innovation and invention. TAI's proud boast is that it can supply any of its products to any planet in the galaxy. And things have marched on since those humble beginnings: we still sell robots, the best on the market but we also sell (brief pause and 'ping' before each one) starships terraformers, medical equipment, explosives, foodstuffs, protective clothing, weft engines, computer brains, recreational narcotics, laser cannons. And that’s much more... Everything a colony world could possibly want to go from this... (howling winds and screams) to this (laughter and birdsong). And that's what we strive to do at TransAlliedInc: build a better world on every world in the galaxy.\nBAYNES: There's a swell of inspirational closing music.\nLORRAINE: _ So what do you think?\nDOCTOR: Typical corporate claptrap. What you carefully neglect to mention —\nBAYNES: Be quiet, Doctor. Davros?\nDAVROS: (Thoughtful) A better world... yes, I can see that.\nBAYNES: Subversives like the Doctor might complain about\nBAYNES: capitalism and universalisation, but that's what we're all here for: to improve the quality of people's lives. To make people feel happy, and secure.\nDAVROS: Yes. So Isaw. You'll forgive me, Mr Baynes. On my world... on Skaro there was nothing like this.\nDOCTOR: It's propaganda, Davros. And there was plenty of that of that on Skaro. It's what they want you to think, it's not the reality.\nDAVROS: No. Of course not. I see that. But... it is an ideal. You heard what it said. They strive to do it, they know they aren't there yet.\nBAYNES: We could get a lot closer if we had a man of destiny like you working with us, Davros.\nDOCTOR: It was an advert. Don't tell me that the creator of the\nDOCTOR: Daleks watches one short film showing happy smiling children running through a cornfield and suddenly the scales fall from his eyes? Baynes, you can't possibly believe that?\nDAVROS: Believe. Mr Baynes, we have a deal.\nDOCTOR: Wait. I have a counter-offer.\nBAYNES: You do?\nDOCTOR: There is a man who can help you, without any of the\nDOCTOR: risks. Davros isn't the only genius, you know. If you really want to help the people of the galaxy, then — well, you don't need Davros.\nBAYNES: So who do you suggest instead?\nDOCTOR: Ah, well far be it for me to say, but —\nLORRAINE: — We had the top headhunters in the galaxy looking for the most radical intellect, the greatest mind. They named Davros number one, by a clear margin. It took us a lot of time and money, but we got the best.\nDOCTOR: Ahem.\nBAYNES: So, go on, who is this other ‘genius’?\nBAYNES: DAVROS The Doctor is offering his own services.\nBAYNES: chuckles.\nDAVROS: Do not underestimate this man, Baynes. He is a scientist, he is devious.\nDAVROS: DOCTOR And every time we've met, I've got the better of you.\nLORRAINE: — Oh, you're that Doctor. Well, if I remember my researches correctly — and I do, Doctor — according to all the records, your presence was incidental, at best. The Daleks repeatedly betrayed Davros, or failed him.\nDOCTOR: Call yourself an historian? It wasn't like that at all! I beat him fair and square. Numerous times.\nDAVROS: He is a dangerous opponent. (Grudgingly) He is my\nDAVROS: equal.\nDOCTOR: Iam? I mean: yes, Iam.\nBAYNES: Here's a question for you, then: what would you do in my position?\nDOCTOR: Davros mustn't be allowed even a foothold of power,\nDOCTOR: ever again. He should be returned to suspended animation. I can give you so pointers with any problem you have.\nBAYNES: Davros?\nDAVROS: (Rants a little) The Doctor is a known saboteur. He is our enemy. He must be (checks himself before her says 'exterminated') incarcerated.\nDOCTOR: Mask slipping, Davros?\nDOCTOR: BAYNES The solution is obvious.\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nBAYNES: You are both men of science. You have a lot in\nBAYNES: common. Either one of you would be a perfect addition to our team here at TAI. But why choose? You can work together!\nBAYNES: DOCTOR and DAVROS No!\nBAYNES: Together, you're going to build a better world.\nBAYNES: End of Part One"

Uh. Who are you? For that matter, where are you?\nEARPIECE: I am your personal organiser. I was inserted into your Inner ear while you slept.\nDOCTOR: Were you indeed?\nEARPIECE: I will provide you with all the information you need, from financial news to nutrition and fashion advice. It's time to get up, Doctor. It is nine point zero. You are due at work at nine point five, in thirty minutes.\nDOCTOR: Uh?\nEARPIECE: You've been asleep for over eleven point five hours.\nDOCTOR: Wake me at nine point four one six recurring.\nEARPIECE: I... you will need time to prepare for work, Doctor. (Beat) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (Snores)\nDOCTOR: Fade to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2.2 - BEDROOM/DOME/WORKSHOP.\nDOCTOR: Fade up DOCTOR snoring.\nEARPIECE: You are due at work in five minutes, Doctor\nDOCTOR: (Instantly awake) There we go. Nothing like a lie-in.\nEARPIECE: What would you like to have dispensed for breakfast?\nDOCTOR: Orange juice. And some toast.\nDOCTOR: Thanks. Oh — some marmalade on that, please. And a pot of tea.\nEARPIECE: Your workshift starts at nine point five. TransAlliedInc is forbidden by law to insist you start before then, but reminds you that we're a happy corporation, full of happy employees, and it's perfectly normal if you want to get to work a little early.\nDOCTOR: Bit late for that, now. Tut tut, naughty Doctor. This is nice toast. Any chance of some more? And how about a grapefruit? EARPIECE And an extracaff coffee to perk you up and ready you for your working day?\nDOCTOR: No, no. This tea will be fine.\nDOCTOR: EARPIECE A suit has been provided for you, made to your measurements.\nDOCTOR: Very generous. But if I'm going to wear anything at\nDOCTOR: all, I'll wear my own clothes, thank you.\nEARPIECE: If you wish to mark yourself out as an individual, you have a choice of these four ties: single colour, striped, amusing cartoon animal, geometric design.\nDOCTOR: I don't want to wear a tie — wouldn't want the colours to clash with my coat, now, would I?\nEARPIECE: I will show you to your place of work. This way, Doctor.\nEARPIECE: vast open-plan office, with floors above and below all bustling with activity.\nDOCTOR: This Dome is very impressive. I'll want a full tour later.\nEARPIECE: Mr Baynes has it scheduled for ten point five. DOCTOR In here?\nEARPIECE: Your workshop is on the ninety-fifth floor. This lift will take you straight there.\nEARPIECE: EARPIECE The share price is up another six points.\nDOCTOR: Don't you ever shut up?\nEARPIECE: I am here to provide you with all the information you need to be a happy, functioning employee of TransAlliedInc. In the absence of new information, I will play soothing music.\nDOCTOR: No thanks.\nEARPIECE: This is your workshop. Please be aware it is advisable to have an explanation for your lateness.\nDOCTOR: I'm barely two minutes late. It's not as though Davros I likely to punch in at nine-thirty sharp, is it?\nBAYNES: Ah, Doctor, glad you could join us.\nEARPIECE: This is Arnold Baynes, the CEO of TransAlliedInc. This room is workshop 95A, the largest workshop in the Dome and —\nDOCTOR: (Over this) Excuse me a moment, Mr Baynes. Could you pass me that screwdriver?\nBAYNES: Sure. Why do you need it?\nDOCTOR: I'm going to stick it in my ear.\nEARPIECE: It is fully-equipped with the latest electronic equipment (squeals, then stops).\nDOCTOR: Sorry about that, Mr Baynes. Now, when Davros gets here, I think I should —\nBAYNES: There's no 'T' in 'team', Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know how to spell —\nDAVROS: Doctor.\nBAYNES: Davros was here at seven this morning, keen to\nBAYNES: started. He's already begun work on this positronic network. As you see, he's made a lot of progress.\nDAVROS: Do not blame him, Mr Baynes — my life-support system means that, unlike the Doctor, I don't need to sleep.\nDAVROS: The DOCTOR decides to brazen it out.\nDOCTOR: My Time Lord constitution means I don't need much sleep, either. An hour a night suffices. And I don't have to come to work a couple of hours early to get up to speed. I can see from here that you’ve configured the alpha matrix all wrong. Set it to three point seven.\nBAYNES: Remarkable. A threefold increase in neural activity.\nDOCTOR: It's nothing.\nDAVROS: You have increased the risk of burn-out.\nDOCTOR: No, I wouldn't worry about —\nDOCTOR: burning out.\nBAYNES: Total burnout, on all circuits.\nDAVROS: It's ruined!\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear. Back to square one, two and a half hours wasted — you could have stayed in bed, Davros.\nDAVROS: You have deliberately destroyed my creation.\nDOCTOR: (This is a blatant lie) No. It was an accident. DAVROS An accident?\nDOCTOR: How was I to know that whoever designed the\nDOCTOR: network failed to build in adequate safety precautions? We'll start again, and this time /'// design the circuit.\nBAYNES: How long will that take?\nDOCTOR: No more than an hour.\nBAYNES: I'll be back then. Afterwards, I'll give you a tour of this Dome.\nDOCTOR: Davros, if you're not careful your face will stick like that. Now, could you pass me those neuronic pliers?\nDAVROS: You sabotaged my work.\nDAVROS: Sounds of electronic work going on.\nDOCTOR: No, no. Let's see... that's a good start. Could I have a clean screwdriver? Thank you. And that length of neural wire?\nDAVROS: Baynes was clear, we are to work together.\nDOCTOR: We are working together. I'm pleasantly surprised just how well you're fitting in as my assistant. Now, I'm going to be a bit busy do you mind making me some tea?\nDAVROS: (Growls)\nDOCTOR: Come on, Davros, making tea shouldn't be beyond you. After all, you can't say 'team' without saying 'tea’,\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2.3 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nLORRAINE: — Howis Davros?\nBAYNES: He seems fine. It's the Doctor I'm worried about. He's acting like a child — but I think Davros is right, he's up to something. Computer noises.\nLORRAINE: _ Well, I've been digging up some notes on him. None\nLORRAINE: of my sources can offer much insight though. There are dozens of fleeting references — hundreds — but nothing substantial.\nBAYNES: Keep looking.\nLORRAINE: __ Iwas hoping to start interviewing Davros today.\nBAYNES: You can do — but I need your research skills to find\nBAYNES: out about the Doctor first.\nLORRAINE: — Youare worried by him.\nBAYNES: Yes.\nLORRAINE: ~ Well, why don’t simply have him... removed?\nBAYNES: Well, we don’t know very much about the Doctor, but\nBAYNES: we know what he does to is enemies. I'd rather we kept him close. Talking of enemies... I've got an interview with that journalist, Willis.\nLORRAINE: _ He’s an enemy?\nBAYNES: Well, I don’t know his news service, so he's near enough.\nLORRAINE: — Who does own it?\nBAYNES: It's one of the independents.\nLORRAINE: Ah.\nBAYNES: Exactly. He’s an asteroid-hugging halfwit. But no\nBAYNES: publicity is bad publicity. And it’s always funny to hear them bleating on. By definition, they don't understand how the galaxy works.\nLORRAINE: _ By definition?\nBAYNES: Yes. If they knew how the galaxy really works, they'd know that it's because of people like me, not despite of it. I'm the solution, not the problem.\nBAYNES: Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 2.4 —- WORKSHOP.\nDAVROS: What are you doing here, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Helping to make a better world, Davros, just like that nice advert said. This new alpha matrix is coming along nicely.\nDAVROS: You want to see me destroyed.\nDOCTOR: I don't want you to destroy all other life in the galaxy\nDOCTOR: — there a precedent for suspecting there is a distinction. And there’s something of a precedent for suspecting that’s what you’re up to.\nDAVROS: I am alone, Doctor. The last of my race.\nDOCTOR: Only because you were instrument a in their\nDOCTOR: extermination.\nDAVROS: Indeed. Doctor, do you know who is the nearest thing that I have to a friend?\nDOCTOR: No.\nDAVROS: You.\nDOCTOR: Me? But —\nDAVROS: We have been through a lot together, have we not?\nDAVROS: We are both scientists. Your intellect, your experience — you are a shining light in a dark galaxy. We have much m common.\nDOCTOR: We're not friends, Davros.\nDAVROS: No. No, but I often think that in some strange dream of history we could have been. Fate has made us allies — imagine what we could achieve.\nDOCTOR: You're dangerous.\nDAVROS: All men of destiny are.\nDOCTOR: Men of what? Destiny? I'm a time traveler, Davros — perhaps I have a different perspective on fate and destiny.\nDAVROS: Perhaps you have. But you’re one of the elite. A Time\nDAVROS: Lord not one of the rabble. I think Baynes and his wife are like us. We can achieve great things.\nDOCTOR: You can’t have four supreme beings, Davros, by definition.\nDAVROS: I always thought it was a question of destruction — but\nDAVROS: I see now that the constant fighting just cancels out any gains. If we can work together...\nDAVROS: DOCTOR To what end? I know you of old, Davros. I know your nature.\nDAVROS: DAVROS The human race has abandoned the death penalty.\nDOCTOR: (Wary at the change of subject) Yes.\nDAVROS: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because humans hold life to be sacred. Because they\nDOCTOR: believe that even the worst criminal might be rehabilitated.\nDAVROS: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: You think you're a reformed character?\nDAVROS: Not yet. But I have been given a new chance. I intend to take it.\nDAVROS: DOCTOR The humans have a saying — 'A Dalek can't change its\nDAVROS: bumps.’\nDAVROS: I am not a Dalek. I have always been in control of my destiny, Doctor. I have misused that power. Done terrible things.\nDOCTOR: But now you're going straight?\nDAVROS: I understand your scepticism. All I ask is that you judge me by my actions.\nDOCTOR: Don't worry, I'll be right here, doing just that. Fade to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2.5 — DOME OFFICE.\nBAYNES: So, Mr Willis, ask me anything.\nWILLIS: I'll just get the recorder going. There. So. Arnold Baynes, s the head of TAI, what do you think your greatest responsibility is?\nBAYNES: My greatest responsibility? Well, I'd say that it's identifying what the people of this galaxy want, before they know they want it.\nWILLIS: Before they know?\nBAYNES: Developing a new technology, researching the market for it, testing it, getting it to comply with all the laws and local customs and restrictions. That alone takes several years. If we want to give people what they want, right now, then we would have had to anticipate the demand years ago.\nWILLIS: But how much of that is telling people they want?\nBAYNES: I don't understand.\nWILLIS: Well, you offer these products. What if people really want something completely different which you're not offering?\nBAYNES: We're not the only corporation. And if we don't give our customers what they want, someone else will.\nWILLIS: But many of the outer planets depend on TAI.\nBAYNES: They choose TAI. There is a difference.\nWILLIS: Only TAI ships go to some systems.\nBAYNES: Because they're invited. Mr Willis, I think I've answered this question.\nWILLIS: Okay. Davros. The announcement that you've hired Davros is bound to cause many people distress.\nBAYNES: It's a bold move. We don't mean to distress anyone.\nWILLIS: Almost everyone has a grandparent or great-\nWILLIS: grandparent who was killed in the Dalek Wars.\nBAYNES: Davros isn't a Dalek — his involvement with Dalek history is marginal.\nWILLIS: (Flabbergasted) He created them.\nBAYNES: He did but mere days later they killed him — or so it\nBAYNES: was thought. It was thousands of years before he was revived, but again it was less than a day before he was captured by Earth forces and bought to trial. He can't be held responsible for what the Daleks did in the millennia in between.\nWILLIS: You don't think he's culpable at all?\nBAYNES: Davros is a scientist. You wouldn't blame Isaac Newton for the gravitronic bomb, or Faraday for the electric chair.\nWILLIS: There will be many people who don’t see it that way.\nBAYNES: Davros is perhaps the foremost single scientific\nBAYNES: genius in the history of this galaxy. People may not like his past, but I'm guessing that when he solves the famine problems m the colonies, or develops a new totally efficient hyperdrive system, they won't refuse to use his technology.\nWILLIS: What do you say to the anti-universalisation lobby, the people who say that corporations have too much influence?\nBAYNES: I don't say anything at all to them. It’s kindergarten politics, not worthy of discussion. There are bigger projects.\nWILLIS: You're committed to your workforce?\nWILLIS: BAYNES Of course.\nWILLIS: What about the rumours that you are planning to close your mining planets down?\nWILLIS: Beat.\nBAYNES: I haven't heard those rumours.\nWILLIS: Are you saying you have no such plans?\nBAYNES: This interview is terminated.\nWILLIS: Sir, [-\nBAYNES: Hand me that recorder.\nWILLIS: No, I— hey!\nBAYNES: What have you heard about the mines?\nWILLIS: So, you do have —\nBAYNES: Don't play games with me. Who's told you this?\nWILLIS: I— are you threatening me, Mr Baynes?\nBAYNES: You're on your own out here, Willis. You call for help, how long do you think it would be before anyone heard you? About a week.\nWILLIS: I'm a member of the Galactic Press Association.\nBAYNES: Spare me your 'ethics'. You've got a duty to report the truth. Not rumours and gossip.\nBAYNES: WILLIS The truth as you see it.\nBAYNES: BAYNES The truth is the truth. There's only one.\nBAYNES: WILLIS The gospel according to TAI?\nBAYNES: (Conciliatory) Mr Willis, we've got off on the wrong\nBAYNES: foot. Now, if you'll just stick around for a few days, calm down a bit, then we'll conduct this interview again. I'll even get you a new voice recorder.\nWILLIS: No. I want to leave.\nBAYNES: As I say — stay here, calm down. We'll talk again.\nWILLIS: I'm a prisoner?\nBAYNES: Mr Willis, you've got alpha-grade access to the Dome.\nBAYNES: That's a freedom that barely a hundred TAI employees have. You've got all the food you can eat, complete access to the datanet. If you're in prison, then so’s virtually the entire population of the galaxy. You think about that. Now, I've got work to do. Real work. Be seeing you.\nBAYNES: The door slams shut, like a prison door. Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 2.6 —- WORKSHOP.\nDAVROS: You don't understand, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Understand what?\nDAVROS: I spent ninety years alone with my thoughts after\nDAVROS: humanity sentenced me to lifelong imprisonment. Many more years after that after my prison was destroyed, as I drifted in space. DOCTOR And now you've had a little think about it, you've decided to mend your ways?\nDAVROS: DAVROS A little think? Ninety years. Do you have any idea? Your people are immortal, aren’t they? Ninety years to you must be nothing. For me it was a lifetime unable to move, I was in complete sensory deprivation. I wasn’t breathing, I couldn't even feel my heart beating. I sat utterly alone. I thought I would go insane.\nDOCTOR: No comment.\nDAVROS: I wondered if I had died, after all. How would I know? I started hearing voices. I started imagining things out there in the darkness. Terrifying things, larger than me, all around me. It was like I had been cast adrift on a raft in the middle of the ocean. I heard the Daleks there, every one of them calling out my name in unison. They sounded so faint.\nDOCTOR: After your blood, or just demanding an apology for what you programmed them to do?\nDAVROS: (Ignoring him) Then I saw your face, tormenting, sneering, cruel, cowardly, just as it is now, just as it has always been. Your true face, not the one you happen to be wearing today. Then there was nothing. A near-century of nothing. I turned inward. My mind consumed my memories, forced me to live and relive every single experience, from the moment I was born. Maybe even before that. I was locked in my past, unable to change my mistakes, condemned to relive them, over and over and over. Every death, every failure, every lie, every I betrayal. Even those I thought I had completely erased from my memory, like — (he stops)\nDOCTOR: Like?\nDAVROS: Every one of the foul deeds I thought I had buried rose up. Taunted me. I felt so ashamed, so... naked. The process stripped me of everything. It showed me how small I was, how insignificant my achievements had been. I was nothing, the mere dreams of a man who should have died millennia before. I passed through eternity, imagining every possible theory, every possible book, every possible idea. And then, as I'd exhausted every combination, in that moment, I felt myself transcending. I felt myself starting to lift away from my body, to join with something greater than me, greater than all things. (Beat) And then I felt my heart beat. That had just been the first second of my imprisonment. And I was back at the beginning, utterly trapped, cursing those who had imprisoned me, a mere deformed, unfinished thing. Before the next heartbeat, the process was repeated in every detail. The third second was the same. As was the next. As was the next.\nDOCTOR: Well, as I'm only wearing a wristwatch, and I don't have a calendar on me, you should probably skip to the end.\nDOCTOR: DAVROS The end? Very well. I came to realise that I could count myself the king of an infinite universe, were it not for my bad\nDOCTOR: dreams. That there was more in heaven and Skaro than was dreamt of in my philosophy.\nDOCTOR: (Laughs) Eternity, and the best you could manage is to misquote Shakespeare? Any monkey with a typewriter could do the same — and at least they'd have managed to write something down.\nDAVROS: My point precisely.\nDOCTOR: Good night, sweet prince — I'm off to get that cup of tea. This alpha matrix I've built is growing nicely — you keep your hand off it. (SFX: door) Ah, hello, Mr Baynes.\nBAYNES: Are you two ready for lunch?\nDAVROS: We can eat here.\nBAYNES: Well, I'm afraid you can't. Galactic employment law requires you both to take at least a half-hour break.\nDAVROS: You have laws that make your workers less productive?\nDOCTOR: People need rest.\nDAVROS: Every four hours?\nBAYNES: Davros, my wife has invited you to dine with her. She’s got our personal chef to come up with something.\nDAVROS: Very well.\nDAVROS: DOCTOR And I—?\nBAYNES: There's the staff canteen. Before then, though, like to show you the computer centre —\nBAYNES: Fade to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 2.7 - COMPUTER CHAMBER. Hubbub. This is a large control room, full of people and equipment. The nerve centre of operations. BAYNES is in the middle of an introduction.\nBAYNES: — the computer centre which coordinates all life here in the Dome. Everything from air conditioning to the production lines.\nDOCTOR: Very impressive. Absolutely everything runs from this centre? That would seem to make it vulnerable to attack.\nBAYNES: They'd have to get through the walls of the Dome, first, and not even a battlecruiser could do that. Then the computer complex itself is built like a fortress, and is completely self-contained, With its own kitchens, communications centre, water supply — even an emergency medical centre.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nBAYNES: This is one of our Delta-grade technicians, Kimberly Todd. Address any concerns to her. I just need to check some figures. Kim.\nKIM: Hello.\nBAYNES: Explain the operating principle of this processor to the Doctor. I'll be back in a moment.\nDOCTOR: (Whispers) Kim — where's Willis?\nKIM: (Whispers) He's back in his quarters. He's had a run-in\nKIM: with Baynes this morning. Doctor, we found a tunnel linking that secret hangar to the Dome. There's an elevator right here to the computer centre. It let us up, but it won't let us back down without the password.\nDOCTOR: Well, obviously Baynes likes to keep his secrets.\nKIM: We also found an automated production line.\nDOCTOR: There are dozens of production lines here, aren't there?\nKIM: Yes, but this one doesn't appear on any of the\nKIM: databases. I checked that this morning.\nDOCTOR: Baynes just told me that everything was run through here.\nKIM: That's what we are told. But I've double-checked — there's no hangar, that production line isn't showing up. If it was on this system, I'd. be able to find it.\nKIM: DOCTOR And so what's he up to? Hang on — Baynes is coming back. (Loudly) I see — so that would explain why the K13 processor has been used, rather than the cheaper L4-11.\nKIM: (Taken aback) That's right. I'm amazed you can tell just by looking at the casing.\nDOCTOR: Quality always demonstrates itself.\nBAYNES: (Approaching) We always use the best, Doctor. We've got to resist the temptation to compromise.\nDOCTOR: Absolutely, absolutely. (Whispers to KIM) Kim, I'll meet you in your quarters ten minutes after the work shift ends.\nKIM: I'll make sure Willis is there, too.\nKIM: Cut to:\nKIM: SCENE 2.8 — PRIVATE DINING ROOM.\nLORRAINE: Davros. Come in.\nDAVROS: Mrs Baynes. It is you I have to thank for my recovery.\nLORRAINE: __ Yes. [have long been an admirer of yours. Here — take your place at the table.\nDAVROS: You... admire me? I had understood that the human race reviled everything that I stood for.\nLORRAINE: __ Centuries have passed. Historians have returned to the subject of the Daleks with new perspectives. The old prejudices have been stripped away. We now appreciate there was much to admire about the Daleks and their creator.\nLORRAINE: DAVROS And everyone thinks like that?\nLORRAINE: _ No. Only a few of us carry the flame. But it burns bright. One day, the whole of humanity will see it that way. I have written books on the subjects — they are bestsellers. People want to hear the truth.\nDAVROS: I... see. May I ask what the purpose of this meeting is?\nLORRAINE: _ Toeat. To talk.\nDAVROS: I see. Your husband tells me there is no such thing as\nDAVROS: a free lunch. So what is expected of me?\nLORRAINE: We know so little about you, but what we know is inspirational. In the entire history of this galaxy, there have been few to match you in the fields of leadership, science, ambition. And to do that from such a world as Skaro...\nDAVROS: It was the only world I knew.\nLORRAINE: We humans don't have much information about Skaro — few who have been there have ever returned. I have some photographs. Here.\nDAVROS: How were these obtained?\nLORRAINE: __ A robot probe took these photos and managed to transmit them before it was detected and destroyed.\nDAVROS: I have never seen the planet from space before.\nLORRAINE: — One of your fields of research was rocketry.\nDAVROS: Yes, but I built rockets to fire at the Thals, not at the moons.\nLORRAINE: Here. Falkus and Omega Mysterium. The moons of Skaro. You must have seen them?\nDAVROS: Yes. When I was young. Before shelters. Before —\nDAVROS: He hesitates. LORRAINE breaks the silence.\nLORRAINE: _ Before?\nDAVROS: It doesn't matter. That is my past. Skaro is my past. Here, takes these back.\nLORRAINE: _ ['mahistorian, Davros. My interest is in the past. You past in particular. You have correctly guessed that I have an ulterior motive — I want to write the definitive biography of Davros, the greatest individual this galaxy has ever produced.\nDAVROS: I see.\nLORRAINE: — And what better way than to interview you? To hear about your past in your own words.\nDAVROS: I have much to offer in the present.\nDAVROS: LORRAINE Of course. No one doubts that. But are all shaped by our past, aren't we? And we know so little of yours.\nDAVROS: I see.\nLORRAINE: —_ You sound disappointed.\nDAVROS: No. Just surprised. I confess that I am a little out of\nDAVROS: my depth in this world. It seems strange to me. This meal is...\nDAVROS: He struggles for the word.\nLORRAINE: __Itis to your liking? If not, I will have replaced and —\nDAVROS: Yes. Of course. I am sure it is good. There is justt so much. My life-support systems are very efficient, I don't need to eat that often. And I lack teeth. And taste buds.\nLORRAINE: — You must miss good food.\nLORRAINE: DAVROS On Skaro, even before my accident, we only had food pills.\nLORRAINE: _ The overpopulated colony planets have food pills. Famine is a serious problem in much of the galaxy.\nDAVROS: Overpopulation was never a problem on Skaro.\nLORRAINE: _ But you've only eaten pills before?\nLORRAINE: DAVROS From time to time, another opportunity presented itself.\nLORRAINE: Fade to:\nLORRAINE: SCENE 2.9 -SKARO WASTELAND.\nLORRAINE: disturbs a pile of rubble.\nDAVROS: (Unmodulated) Wait.\nSHAN: Davros, what is it?\nDAVROS: There. A rodent. One of the herbivorous ones. We should catch it.\nSHAN: Why? We can't eat it. The radiation levels out here are will over safety levels.\nDAVROS: It's alive. That's healthy enough for me.\nSHAN: What's wrong with food pills?\nDAVROS: You know where they come from?\nSHAN: Packets.\nDAVROS: Before then. Wait (Beat) Got you!\nDAVROS: away.\nSHAN: (Laughs)\nDAVROS: I will capture it.\nSHAN: Wait a moment. Where do food pills come from?\nDAVROS: Where do you think?\nSHAN: This is one of your scientific tests, isn't it? Well...\nSHAN: before war, people used to eat plants and special food animals.\nDAVROS: Cattle.\nSHAN: Is that what the word used to mean? I've only heard it to mean Thal prisoners.\nDAVROS: But cattle need to eat plants.\nSHAN: Inefficient. We should just eat the plants ourselves. DAVROS And that's what we’d did. But plants need sunlight to grow.\nSHAN: There’s been no sunlight since the atomic shelling began.\nDAVROS: No.\nSHAN: So how do the plants grow?\nDAVROS: There is still some sunlight. And we can propagate plants in artificial sunlight.\nSHAN: But not on the scale to feed the whole Kaled Nation.\nDAVROS: No. Food is almost all recycled.\nSHAN: From?\nDAVROS: Scraps of food. Leftover vegetable matter. Corpses.\nSHAN: What?\nDAVROS: People.\nSHAN: No. You've just made that up to scare me. The Mutos are cannibals — the Kaleds would never stoop to that.\nSHAN: DAVROS The Mutos understand what nature requires. They are honest — we have to hide what we are doing.\nSHAN: This isn't true?\nDAVROS: My first scientific work was in the rendering plants. It horrifies you?\nDAVROS: SHAN Of course. Doesn't it horrify you?\nDAVROS: No. It's logical. By definition, our bodies contain all\nDAVROS: the chemicals needed to feed us. The alternative is to waste that resource.\nSHAN: Dead bodies are about the only thing Skaro has plenty of.\nDAVROS: Precisely. But there are still some animals. Like that rodent. Where's it gone?\nSHAN: It's been over there for the last two minutes.\nDAVROS: Where?\nSHAN: See that patch of bare earth, just before the silo?\nDAVROS: I see it.\nSHAN: Davros, wait! There could be snipers.\nDAVROS: Not this close to the shelters.\nSHAN: It can see you.\nDAVROS: Be quiet. I can get it.\nSHAN: (Laughs) Are you all right?\nDAVROS: You've frightened it off, it —\nDAVROS: It stood on a mine. This is a minefield.\nSHAN: Ours or a Thal one?\nDAVROS: That really doesn't matter. Help me back up.\nDAVROS: SHAN Of course. The ground is muddy, we can retrace our\nDAVROS: steps to the shelter. We've got all the readings we need. Fade to:\nSCENCE: 2.10 — PRIVATE DINING ROOM.\nLORRAINE: ~~ Who were you with?\nDAVROS: It doesn't matter who.\nLORRAINE: itis difficult to imagine that you had friends.\nDAVROS: Is it?\nLORRAINE: __ It seems such an ordinary thing.\nDAVROS: I was an ordinary man.\nLORRAINE: _ Now you are so much more.\nDAVROS: I had friends, then. Many of them. War makes\nDAVROS: comrades of us all. And then takes all those comrades away.\nLORRAINE: — We don't even know how the war started.\nDAVROS: Heh. Neither did we.\nLORRAINE: — You didn't know why you were fighting?\nDAVROS: We knew that. We fought because the only alternative\nDAVROS: was extermination. Our only tactic was to commit genocide before the accursed enemy did. But do I know why the war started, who fired the first shot? The Kaled historians said it was the Thals. The Thal historians said it was the Kaleds.\nLORRAINE: — Human historians are committed to the truth. To objectivity.\nDAVROS: They always say that about scientists, too. (Beat) Do you know when the first time was in my life no one was trying to kill me?\nLORRAINE: No.\nDAVROS: When you revived me. Yesterday.\nLORRAINE: You are safe now.\nDAVROS: Yes. If it wasn't for the Doctor.\nLORRAINE: _ You think he will try to kill you?\nDAVROS: No, that is not his way. He confines, he limits, he\nDAVROS: imprisons. Sets traps. (Laughs) He would have caught that rodent. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 2.11 - DOME.\nBAYNES: Heading back to work already, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I had a big breakfast. Your stock price is rising, I see.\nBAYNES: Davros will prove an asset to this company. He'll give this company the edge it needs.\nDOCTOR: ‘Edge’?\nBAYNES: Do you know the problem with the corporations,\nBAYNES: Doctor? We won a long time ago. Our way of doing things is the best that humanity's ever come up with.\nDOCTOR: It would be a sad reflection on the human race if that was true.\nBAYNES: Hey, I'm not saying we're perfect. But our way's all\nBAYNES: about keeping the maximum number of people alive and happy, and consuming.\nBAYNES: DOCTOR A short-sighted philosophy that almost destroyed your people in the twenty-first century.\nBAYNES: Ancient history. And the collapse of Earth's ecosystem is what forced us out into the stars, out into the galaxy. Our way was best. We prevailed.\nDOCTOR: Well, if you've got it all worked out, why do you need Davros?\nBAYNES: We've gone this far, but for hundreds of years we've been stuck in a technological, no, a cultural cul-de-sac. He can make the next leap forward. He can think out of the box.\nDOCTOR: He's evil.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES A meaningless label.\nDOCTOR: It's not a term I bandy about without thinking. But Davros is evil. He'll destroy everything you've built here.\nBAYNES: He knows he's better off working for me. What's the alternative? Prison? Death?\nDOCTOR: Supremacy. You're handing him the means to enslave the whole human race.\nBAYNES: He's one man. He's barely half of one.\nDOCTOR: He'll destroy you, Mr Baynes. He'll take out your eyes then he'll come back for the sockets. And he'll laugh as he does it. Watch yourself, protect yourself, and you might just make it out alive. Now... I've got work to do. Don't worry — the lecture's over. I won't tell you again. If you’re as savvy as you say you are, I won't need to.\nDOCTOR: Door. Beat. SFX: radio bleep.\nBAYNES: Hangar control, this is Baynes. Keep the interceptor on standby until further notice. I might need to leave in a hurry.\nBAYNES: SCENE 2.12 -BEDROOM. We hear a door code being entered from outside — then the door opens.\nKIM: is humming but stops suddenly as she enters.\nKIM: Willis, what are you doing here?\nWILLIS: You said to meet me in your quarters.\nKIM: But how did you get in?\nWILLIS: I've picked up a few tricks.\nKIM: I see...\nWILLIS: There's not a problem, is there?\nKIM: It's just... well, there's precious little privacy in the Dome as it is. We're all convinced our quarters are bugged.\nWILLIS: No. They don't need to be.\nKIM: What do you mean?\nWILLIS: TAI aren't interested in knowing what you think, they only want to tell you what they think.\nKIM: We all read your news service here, you know. That's the truth, we know it.\nWILLIS: Yeah. But you read it once a week, for a few minutes.\nKIM: We can think for ourselves, you know. Do you want a drink dispensed?\nWILLIS: Please. And I know you can think for yourself — but\nWILLIS: the constant bombardment of advertising, dome-u-soaps and corporate announcements is like hypnosis. Makes people who work for the corporations talk like they've swallowed a company brochure.\nKIM: I don't think so. What do you want to drink? The dispenser is top of the range, and can synthesise over a thousand — oh.\nWILLIS: Don't worry about it, Kim. You're not alone, and the\nWILLIS: Doctor and I will help you. SCENE 2.13 - WORKSHOP.\nBAYNES: So, gentlemen. It's nearly the end of the first day. Can\nBAYNES: you appreciate the problem, yet?\nDOCTOR: We have done substantially better than that.\nBAYNES: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Here.\nBAYNES: What's this? DAVROS A working prototype. BAYNES In a day?\nDAVROS: For many years now, I have had a number of theories\nDAVROS: in this field. Once I shared these with the Doctor, he was able to apply a couple of interesting techniques.\nDOCTOR: I've picked up a few tricks of the trade on my travels.\nBAYNES: We thought you'd take months to do this. Why, gentlemen, in one day you've justified our investment in you.\nDOCTOR: I always said we'd make a winning team. Now — we’ve helped you out. It's time for us to move on.\nDAVROS: No.\nDOCTOR: That was the deal, Mr Baynes.\nBAYNES: It most certainly was not.\nDAVROS: Famine. That is the problem we must address next Billions die every year, Doctor. Mrs Baynes told me over dinner.\nDOCTOR: Five course, or just the three?\nBAYNES: You could end the Galactic Famine?\nDAVROS: Not in a day.\nBAYNES: But you could come up with the solution?\nDAVROS: I think so. I need to analyse the problem more fully.\nBAYNES: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I... it's certainly an ambitious aim.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES Of course it is — Davros, if you managed to feed\nDOCTOR: everyone in the galaxy... why, you'd be the greatest humanitarian in history. The greatest hero.\nDAVROS: Is that right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why... yes.\nDAVROS: Then I must begin immediately. Doctor?\nBAYNES: Are you going to help us make history?\nDOCTOR: I... [have a prior engagement\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2.14 -BEDROOM.\nWILLIS: Where is he?\nKIM: Relax. He said he would be here — he's not even late, yet.\nWILLIS: If Baynes sees us together —\nKIM: — then I have far more to lose than either you or the\nKIM: Doctor. You said this was important, that billions of lives were at stake? It has to be worth the risk.\nDOCTOR: Kim. Hello. Willis.\nWILLIS: Doctor. You're free to speak.\nDOCTOR: We have to stop Davros.\nWILLIS: Davros is not the problem. Baynes is the danger. I was\nWILLIS: speaking to him, and he threatened me — he did everything but throw me out of an airlock.\nDOCTOR: Davros first, then Baynes.\nWILLIS: What's he got planned?\nDOCTOR: Well, he's —\nKIM: Wait. (Beat)\nWILLIS: Are you all right?\nDOCTOR: She's listening to her earpiece.\nKIM: They've just put out a press release — Davros wants to end the galactic famines.\nWILLIS: Who doesn't?\nKIM: Apparently he says he's got an innovative new strategy which will demonstrate radicalised thinking and shift the hunger paradigm.\nDOCTOR: I suspect Davros didn't write that press release himself\nDOCTOR: — indeed I can guess who did. If I know Davros, he'll prevent people from starving to death by shooting them before they get a chance. This is precisely what I was saying — Baynes is a problem, but Davros will soon be operating on a far bigger scale. If he says he's doing whatever he's doing because it'll relieve famine... well, who's going to stop him?\nWILLIS: You still haven't seen the robots.\nWILLIS: DOCTOR The what? Oh yes — that robot production line.\nKIM: It might not have anything to do with Davros, but Baynes is determined to keep it a secret.\nWILLIS: Which means it can't be anything good.\nDOCTOR: Well, no: he's not exactly afraid to blow his own trumpet, is he? Let's wait until things have quietened down a bit and take a look.\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2.15 -BEDROOM.\nDOCTOR: unison.\nDAVROS: (Normal voice, but over distorting Tannoy) Soldiers of the Kaled Nation, this has been a day of great victory. Not only over the Thals, but over the enemy within. On the very day our forces destroyed the entire Thal navy, using a secret weapon of my devising, we have also crushed a spy ring here in Kaled City. These are the traitors —\nDAVROS: You will recognise some of them. Members of the Elite, even members of the Council. They have made their confessions, they have implicated others. The whole Council will need to be restructured. But we will not hesitate. All the enemies of the Kaleds must be —\nDAVROS: Abrupt silence, then DAVROS wakes with a start.\nDAVROS: Uh! (Beat) Now that is odd...\nDAVROS: SCENE 2.16 — PRIVATE DINING ROOM.\nBAYNES: So, you've talked to Davros now, what do you make of him?\nLORRAINE: __ Icanonly see him as a victim.\nBAYNES: He doesn't come across that way.\nLORRAINE: _ He's always been a slave to his past — his upbringing, his circumstances, the relentless propaganda of a planet at total war.\nBAYNES: His disabilities.\nLORRAINE: No. No, in an odd way, that's really the least of his problems. I think it's the pain that drives him on, allows him to see himself as unique.\nBAYNES: Really?\nLORRAINE: _ Think about it — he's capable of chemically inducing a form of forced evolution, of creating an entire new race. He's a geneticist and biologist of almost unparalleled skill.\nBAYNES: I know that.\nLORRAINE: _ Well, surely he could have cloned himself a new body — as undamaged one. We've been able to do that for centuries.\nBAYNES: Some people are odd about that. Don't see it as themselves.\nLORRAINE: _ They are?\nBAYNES: You've never faced the choice. You said it yourself\nBAYNES: human race has been able to prolong their lives for centuries just by cloning themselves and downloading their consciousness. It's not that expensive. But people don't like to do that. You wouldn't.\nLORRAINE: _ But I'm not Davros. He deserves life. He could offer\nLORRAINE: so much.\nLORRAINE: BAYNES The people that can afford it freeze themselves. You know why?\nLORRAINE: _ Because it's still them?\nBAYNES: Yes. A precise copy is still just a copy. And that copy would know that somewhere, someone had just flicked a switch and killed the original.\nLORRAINE: = Oh.\nBAYNES: We looked into it ten years ago. Market research.\nBAYNES: Sure, they'll take cloned organs, they'll clone their pets. But the whole deal — people weren't interested. I know Davros — he'll cling onto the life he’s got. He's a fighter.\nLORRAINE: _ Heis that.\nBAYNES: Hey. Should I be getting jealous?\nLORRAINE: — Ofcourse not!\nBAYNES: You be careful of him.\nLORRAINE: You've been listening to the Doctor.\nBAYNES: I listen to a lot of people. There's a chance the Doctor\nBAYNES: is right. And if he is, we need an exit strategy.\nBAYNES: SCENE 2.17 - FACTORY FLOOR.\nWILLIS: It was through here.\nDOCTOR: What's down that way?\nKIM: We had a look — I think it's another entrance to the mines.\nDOCTOR: It's dark in here. I really must start carrying a torch.\nKIM: I could find the light switch.\nWILLIS: We don't want to alert any guards.\nDOCTOR: We haven't seen any guards. But there were some at the hangar. There's enough light for the moment.\nKIM: These robots scare me.\nDOCTOR: Well, there's nothing to worry about — for one thing, they look like industrial units. For another, they aren't activated.\nWILLIS: Do you recognise the design?\nDOCTOR: Well, from the outside, industrial robots all look the same really, don't they? A few cosmetic differences here and there a few different tool attachments and the like. To find out what they are for I need to get closer.\nWILLIS: How close?\nDOCTOR: Well, ideally right inside them, with a screwdriver. So I can get to see the workings.\nKIM: There's something wrong here.\nWILLIS: Apart from a huge secret factory?\nDOCTOR: Kim's right. This is an automated factory. It needn't ever be shut down. So it's been shut down for a reason.\nKIM: It must be a problem.\nDOCTOR: Or a solution...\nKIM: Doctor?\nWILLIS: Over here — there's a robot on the floor.\nDOCTOR: They've taken it off the line to have a look at it. Hold\nDOCTOR: this. (Access panel flips off) There — look, they've been having a fiddle around inside its central processing unit.\nWILLIS: If you say so.\nDOCTOR: I only know because earlier today... yes. Do you recognise that, Kim?\nKIM: It's some sort of neural device. It's very advanced.\nKIM: Whoever designed it must be a genius.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nWILLIS: What?\nDOCTOR: I designed his processor. With a little help from Davros. It was mean for a starship’s navigation computer. Not for a robot. (Panel goes back on) There. Baynes lied about how be would use the research.\nKIM: So, what do we do?\nWILLIS: We alert the authorities.\nWILLIS: KIM To what? That a company that’s always built robots is robots?\nDOCTOR: We need full schematics — and we should take the initiative, not just wait for the authorities.\nKIM: Shut down this place?\nWILLIS: Blow it up! What's that?\nKIM: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I must have reactivated it when I replaced that panel.\nWILLIS: We have to destroy it!\nDOCTOR: Willis! No!\nDOCTOR: You threatened it. It's gone into defensive mode.\nKIM: What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It means it's going to kill us!\nDOCTOR: End of Part Two"

It's gone into defensive mode.\nKIM: What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: It means it's going to kill us!\nWILLIS: (Weakly) I wasn't threatening it.\nDOCTOR: I know that. I'm not the one you have to convince.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3.2 — BEDROOM.\nDAVROS: (Sounds shaken) Ah, Baynes. Arnold.\nBAYNES: You said you didn't need sleep. I hope it's okay if I— ? DAVROS Of course. Come in.\nBAYNES: Are you all right?\nDAVROS: A... nightmare, that is all.\nBAYNES: You have nightmares? I didn't think you slept. DAVROS To the first approximation, I have done nothing else in\nBAYNES: my life. From time to time, things from my past rise up to confront me. Things I am not proud of.\nBAYNES: But you're okay?\nDAVROS: Yes. Repairing the problem is just a simple matter of adjusting the chemicals in my memory centres. (Beat) We have much to discuss. I have analysed the economic information you have given me.\nBAYNES: All of it?\nBAYNES: DAVROS Of course.\nBAYNES: But there's enough data there to... never mind. What conclusions have you reached?\nDAVROS: It is a chaotic system.\nBAYNES: You've got that right. DAVROS A chaotic system in both the vernacular and scientific\nBAYNES: senses. Planets that don't grow enough food to support their own populations grow cash crops for planets with too much food to eat. The farming methods on those worlds are —\nBAYNES: Hey, I hope you're not turning into one of those guys that blames everything on the corporations, like that journalist.\nDAVROS: Journalist?\nBAYNES: Willis. Forget I mentioned him.\nBAYNES: DAVROS The economy of Skaro was far more efficient. Gearing to war meant we were focused, that we conserved energy and rations.\nBAYNES: It's pretty tricky to manage that in peacetime.\nDAVROS: Indeed. I was —\nBAYNES: Hang on, [ have to get this. (To radio) Yeah?\nBAYNES: Well, what's causing it?\nBAYNES: Conversation.\nBAYNES: I'll be down there straight away. Try to contain the situation.\nDAVROS: Trouble?\nBAYNES: One of the robots has got off the production line and is attacking people.\nBAYNES: DAVROS And where is the Doctor?\nBAYNES: BAYNES The Doctor?\nDAVROS: Just a suspicion, Mr Baynes. Perhaps I am being\nDAVROS: paranoid. Perhaps it is nothing to do with him. I will let you find out what's going on down there. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.3 —- FACTORY FLOOR. The robot takes another step.\nKIM: It hasn't killed us yet — that's got to be a good sign.\nDOCTOR: It's trying to work out which of the three of us represents the biggest threat.\nDOCTOR: Ah. I think it's decided. Me. Well, you can't fault it’s judgement.\nWILLIS: What can we do, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You can both get to safety.\nKIM: But what about you?\nDOCTOR: I'll cope. Go — quickly!\nKIM: This way.\nKIM: A bit more stomping.\nDOCTOR: Hello there, old chap. Got me alone at last, I see.\nDOCTOR: Good robot. As you can see, I'm unarmed. I don’t\nDOCTOR: represent a threat to you. Do you understand?\nDOCTOR: (Gasps)\nBAYNES: Try not to damage the head!\nBAYNES: The robot roars, but is being blown apart. One more burst of gunfire and it collapses.\nBAYNES: Cease fire, men!\nDOCTOR: Mr Baynes. Thank you. Was it really necessary to destroy it?\nBAYNES: I'll be honest with you, Doctor — I was thinking of\nBAYNES: letting it carry on.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nBAYNES: What are you doing down here?\nDOCTOR: I was just on a stroll, a tour of the Dome, and — BAYNES To get past here, you had to get through three security\nDOCTOR: doors. Doors made of solid nutrilium, which the manufacturers assured me were impenetrable.\nDOCTOR: Well, they'd be pretty useless as doors if that was the case, wouldn't they?\nBAYNES: Z can get through them. I was under the impression I was the only one.\nDOCTOR: I didn't even realise it was restricted. There are no\nDOCTOR: signs saying that, are there? I'm so sorry, this has all been a terrible\nDOCTOR: misunderstanding.\nBAYNES: Were you alone?\nDOCTOR: Can you see anyone else here?\nBAYNES: Why did the robot attack you?\nDOCTOR: Hmmm?\nBAYNES: What did you do to provoke it? It's a simple mining robot.\nDOCTOR: You're blaming me for one of your robots malfunctioning?\nBAYNES: It wouldn't attack without a reason.\nDOCTOR: I gave you a reason — shoddy workmanship.\nBAYNES: Come with me.\nBAYNES: Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 3.4 — CORRIDOR.\nKIM: What do you think happened to the Doctor?\nWILLIS: Doesn't that earpiece of yours tell you?\nKIM: No. It only says what the company wants me to hear. Do you think the Doctor got away?\nWILLIS: I'm sure he did. He's resourceful.\nKIM: What will he do?\nWILLIS: I've no idea — it was a big robot.\nKIM: No. I mean after he's beaten it. Will he come back for us?\nWILLIS: We can't be sure of that. We have to start taking the initiative ourselves. We need to send a message offworld.\nKIM: Who would we contact? TAI are the only authority in this sector.\nWILLIS: They still follow Earth law. They have to.\nKIM: There's no one who forces them to.\nWILLIS: There is: the other corporations. They have laws and\nWILLIS: rules and codes of conduct. They have to, or it would be the law of the jungle. They’re corrupt — but they like a level playing field.\nKIM: But what have TAI done wrong?\nWILLIS: Well — how did they get hold of Davros? An act of piracy. They’ve announced they have him. They're admitting they killed that crew.\nKIM: I checked — there weren't any records of Davros being moved. It must have been top secret.\nKIM: WILLIS And no paper trail, no case to answer. But someone was expecting Davros to arrive, and they'll know there's a problem.\nKIM: Right.\nWILLIS: Look — there has to be something incriminating on that computer. And you've got full access to it. So you've got to be the b st\nWILLIS: chance we have of finding evidence against Baynes.\nKIM: I'm back on duty at eight point two five. I'll do my best.\nWILLIS: Right. Look - we shouldn't _be se,en tog ther. I'll o b\nWILLIS: to my room. Hopefully if the Doctor made It, he ll get m touch WIth on of us. Cut to:\nWILLIS: SCENE 3.5 - WORKSHOP.\nWILLIS: Door chime.\nDAVROS: (Preoccupied) Come in. (Door opens) Ahh. Mrs Baymes?\nLORRAINE: __ I'm looking for my husband.\nDAVROS: He was here. He was called away.\nLORRAINE: ~ What are you reading?\nDAVROS: Stock market reports for the last fifty years. The\nDAVROS: patterns are fascinating.\nLORRAINE: _ ['mnotan economist, but I didn't think there were any patterns in stock market behaviour. The galaxy's economy is too diverse.\nDAVROS: It is a complicated equation. But — here. Cross- checking it, this holds true for the last twenty years, I'm working backwards to see whether it is a universal rule, or merely a local one.\nLORRAINE: This means nothing to me.\nLORRAINE: DAVROS The E stands for the Elliot Wave and P stands for a planetary economy's —\nLORRAINE: I'm not a mathematician. Davros, I doubt there are many minds in this galaxy that could follow your work, let alone match it.\nDAVROS: (Sadly) You may be right.\nLORRAINE: Yours is the supreme intellect. You have no equals.\nDAVROS: Indeed.\nLORRAINE: __ Did I say something wrong?\nDAVROS: No.\nLORRAINE: _ Idid. What was it?\nDAVROS: There's no challenge if I don't have an equal.\nLORRAINE: __ It's tough at the top.\nDAVROS: It is lonely.\nLORRAINE: _ With this equation alone, you could become the richest man in the galaxy, almost overnight. You could shape the galaxy to your will.\nDAVROS: It is a piece of data, that is all. The intellectual community could only benefit from it.\nLORRAINE: __ Back on Skaro, if you had been doing some research and it turned out that it could be used by the military, would you stop your researches?\nDAVROS: No, of course not.\nLORRAINE: This equation is a weapon. A weapon to defeat your economic rivals. It's your destiny to rule, Davros. It always was. You so much more than we are.\nDAVROS: I see.\nLORRAINE: Are you all right, Davros?\nDAVROS: Shan, everything feels so empty. So easy.\nLORRAINE: ~— What did you just call me?\nDAVROS: I... would you leave me? You have given me much to\nDAVROS: think about.\nLORRAINE: — Ofcourse. I won't tell my husband about that equation. Not until you've thought about it.\nDAVROS: (Hollow) Thank you.\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.6 —- BEDROOM.\nEARPIECE: ...already announcing a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence. Rival companies are registering scepticism but\nTAI: stock is already up on its record gains yesterday, and now stands at a seventy-five-year high, lifting the market as a whole, despite the\nTAI: collapse of rival stock. The time is eight hours.\nTAI: The DOCTOR wakes up.\nDOCTOR: Whuh. Uh. Who are you? For that matter, where are you?\nEARPIECE: I am your personal organiser. I was inserted into your inner ear while you slept.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, not again...\nEARPIECE: I will provide you with all the information you need from celebrity gossip and horoscopes to —\nDOCTOR: You can start by telling me where the nearest screwdriver is. Why isn't this door opening?\nEARPIECE: You are asked to stay in your quarters until your Performance Review has been completed.\nDOCTOR: Performance Review? I really don't like the sound of that.\nEARPIECE: Mr Baynes will contact you shortly. Until then would you like me to dispense breakfast?\nDOCTOR: I think I've lost my appetite.\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3.7 — PRIVATE DINING ROOM. Door.\nBAYNES: Darling I... oh, good day, Davros. Lorraine, I've run all that information you found about the Doctor through the human resources computer. It recommends that we keep him on, but withdraw some privileges.\nDAVROS: That would be a logical course of action — provided we could prevent further transgressions.\nLORRAINE: That's ridiculous, we should —\nBAYNES: I know. We're going to deport the Doctor.\nLORRAINE: __ Deport?\nBAYNES: There's a ship leaving in a couple of days. By then we'll have dealt with his journalist friend.\nDAVROS: Won't they go straight to the authorities? BAYNES To say what? They don't have proof we're doing\nDAVROS: anything illegal. What a minute am I saying — I've not done anything illegal.\nLORRAINE: We attacked that ship, killed the crew.\nBAYNES: There's nothing to link us with that.\nLORRAINE: There's the hangar. If they find the interceptor, they'll know it was us. They'll be able to tell!\nBAYNES: No one can find it. DAVROS The Doctor was there.\nBAYNES: Like I said, he won't be able to find it. What — why are\nBAYNES: you two looking at me like that?\nLORRAINE: ~— We should kill the Doctor. He's not working for anyone, he wouldn't be expected back anywhere.\nLORRAINE: BAYNES And the journalist?\nLORRAINE: — Anunfortunate accident could be arranged. Kill two birds with one stone.\nDAVROS: No.\nLORRAINE: — You don't want the Doctor dead?\nDAVROS: He is a useful assistant. Away from here, he can only\nDAVROS: cause trouble for our operations. Your computer's solution was logical. Further, I think you should place him under constant surveillance.\nBAYNES: Can't be done.\nDAVROS: You have cameras and microphones throughout the Dome. These aren't used to monitor your staff?\nBAYNES: We don't snoop on our employee's private lives, no.\nDAVROS: Then why have the cameras?\nLORRAINE: ~ We have them in public areas for basic security. If there’s an intruder or a fire, then we can pinpoint the problem. DAVROS The Doctor is far more dangerous than a mere fire. You talk about 'security'? He is a clear threat to yours. He was caught red-handed.\nBAYNES: We've never spied on our workers like that. It's unethical.\nDAVROS: Yet the technology is there, ready to be used. The\nDAVROS: intercoms in our quarters could easily be adapted to listen in. I could that for you. Only in the rooms where the Doctor is, if that's what you want.\nBAYNES: No.\nDAVROS: No? You are scared by the law? The law is not for people like us, Baynes.\nBAYNES: I'm not scared. There's no need for you to do anything\nBAYNES: the system already allows for the monitoring of private rooms.\nLORRAINE: __ It does?\nDAVROS: It must be done. The Doctor could be an asset to me... to this company. But only if he can be controlled.\nLORRAINE: — Youcan control him?\nDAVROS: Yes. Naturally, if it is proved that Iam wrong, then there are always other options to explore. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.8 - BEDROOM.\nDOCTOR: Come on, let me out.\nEARPIECE: Please remain calm, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you're right. (Beat) Could I have some breakfast, now?\nDOCTOR: EARPIECE Of course.\nDOCTOR: Anything I want?\nEARPIECE: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, I want something a bit unusual for my breakfast today. I'd like a length of wire, please. Copper wire — about five inches long.\nEARPIECE: Certainly, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yum yum. That does look appetising. And, oh look, if I stick the wire here —\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The door opens. Remarkable.\nBAYNES: Remarkable indeed.\nEARPIECE: This is Arnold Baynes the —\nDOCTOR: I know who it is.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES And do you recognise this?\nEARPIECE: It is a small computer processor, of advanced design.\nDOCTOR: I ought to know — I made it. That's the brain from the\nDOCTOR: robot that attacked me. Baynes, you must see by now — Davros did something to the processor. Made the robot hostile.\nBAYNES: No. We've analysed the fault. It comes from your configuration of the alpha matrix.\nDOCTOR: Baynes — it was Davros, I know it.\nBAYNES: Here's the report. See for yourself.\nDOCTOR: Look, I — Oh. (Beat) Well, that might have caused the malfunction.\nBAYNES: We've assessed the situation here — you could still be a valuable asset. I wanted to deport you, but Davros came to a different conclusion — he wants you to assist him with the famine problem.\nDOCTOR: Be his teaboy, you mean?\nBAYNES: You've hardly done anything to suggest we can trust you. And this is vital work.\nDOCTOR: What are those robots, Baynes?\nBAYNES: They are mining robots.\nDOCTOR: I thought you were planning to close all the mines.\nBAYNES: No, I— you didn't know Davros was coming here.\nBAYNES: You came here because you heard I was closing the mines?\nDOCTOR: That's right.\nBAYNES: (Hollow laugh) Typical. That was just an idea. Some ridiculous idea one of the focus groups came up with when we were looking for radical solutions.\nDOCTOR: You don't plan to close them?\nBAYNES: No. It would make no sense — they're all profitable, give or take. When the focus group came up with that, I got rid of the focus group, not the miners. You came here because someone found a discarded note, I take it? It was never a serious proposal.\nDOCTOR: But that still doesn't explain why you're building an army of robots that need brains powerful enough to coordinate intergalactic starships.\nBAYNES: Fifty, Doctor. Hardly an army.\nDOCTOR: It doesn't explain why you need one. BAYNES The galaxy is at a crossroads, Doctor. We've reached\nDOCTOR: the limits of human expansion. To maintain our competitive edge, we need new ways of thinking. Ask anyone. That robot is capable of new ways of thinking. It'll be able to do things that our competitors’ robots won't.\nDOCTOR: What sort of things?\nBAYNES: I don't know that. The whole point is to push out into uncharted territory. To stretch the envelop. To think the unthinkable.\nDOCTOR: Well if you want the unthinkable, hiring Davros was a\nDOCTOR: step in the right direction. He's not changed, Baynes, he's not capable of approaching a problem with an open mind. You'll see.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3.9 - BEDROOM.\nDOCTOR: Door chimes.\nWILLIS: Door opens.\nDAVROS: journalist?\nWILLIS: Yeah?\nWILLIS: Mr Willis.\nWILLIS: (Shocked) Davros.\nWILLIS: Do not be alarmed.\nWILLIS: (But he is) No?\nWILLIS: I see my reputation has preceded me. You are a\nWILLIS: Yes. Why are you here? I am trying to report on a story. Uncover evidence that\nWILLIS: Baynes is involved in wrongdoing.\nDAVROS: I see. Presumably you haven't found that evidence? I've been trying, but —\nDAVROS: Here.\nDAVROS: What's this?\nDAVROS: What does it look like?\nDAVROS: A box.\nDAVROS: Open it.\nDAVROS: It's — I don't know what it is. (Beat) What is it? (Impatient) It's an atomic weapon.\nDAVROS: What? It's... no.\nDAVROS: It's not armed.\nDAVROS: I damn well hope not!\nDAVROS: But it is illegal. The Treaty of Parlagon prevents any\nDAVROS: private individual from holding atomic weapons.\nWILLIS: something.\nDAVROS: Baynes will just say that it's used in mining or\nDAVROS: He will indeed. At which point you tell him that a\nDAVROS: mining charge would be designed to maximise the blast effect. This device is a powerful explosive — but its main purpose is to spread radiation over a wide area.\nWILLIS: It's a weapon.\nDAVROS: Far more effective on people than on rocks.\nDAVROS: WILLIS And I can have it?\nDAVROS: Without the trigger, it's useless. Although I advise you not to try to open it up.\nWILLIS: Okay. Now why did you give me this? What do you want in return?\nWILLIS: DAVROS An excellent question. Think of it as a goodwill gesture.\nWILLIS: Cut to:\nWILLIS: SCENE 3.10 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nLORRAINE: ~— What's going on?\nBAYNES: I'm not sure — but I've got it under control.\nLORRAINE: Where's the Doctor, now?\nBAYNES: He's in the workshop. I came to take Davros over.\nLORRAINE: _ He's gone. He said he had important work. I was promised full access to him. Yesterday, just talking to him, it became obvious that my book will be fascinating. Revolutionary, even —\nBAYNES: (Interrupting) You'll get your access, and you'll get your book. He’s been awake a little over a day. It's going to take time for him to find his feet. So to speak.\nLORRAINE: __ [really think he could end the famine. If anyone can.\nBAYNES: So do I. And the more colonists there are, the bigger the markets for TAI goods.\nLORRAINE: sIs that all you think about?\nBAYNES: That's all there is, Lorraine. The human race\nBAYNES: consuming and expanding.\nLORRAINE: — You make us sound like locusts.\nBAYNES: No. Far more efficient than that, far more driven. There are more galaxies than there are grains of sand on a beach. There is so much more. And Davros will help us make the leap to other\nBAYNES: galaxies.\nLORRAINE: ~ What if he doesn't want that?\nBAYNES: We're kindred spirits. I can sense it. He and [ are...\nBAYNES: we're the same. Driven, ambitious, radical — maybe even a little bit ruthless. In the end, though — well, he's a research scientist. How\nBAYNES: dangerous can a jumped-up lab technician be?\nLORRAINE: — Youare both men of destiny, Arnold. The sort of people that history bends to accommodate.\nLORRAINE: BAYNES And you?\nLORRAINE: __ I'msomeone that can see the course of history. Someone that knows that we're on the verge of forging a new era.\nLORRAINE: SCENE 3.11 - BEDROOM.\nDAVROS: Mr Willis, you have serious reservations about the economic system?\nWILLIS: Er, yes.\nDAVROS: I would be interested to hear what those reservations are.\nWILLIS: You would?\nDAVROS: Yes. Mr Baynes is clearly one of the lucky ones. Yet there are citizens of other planets dying from diseases?\nWILLIS: That's right.\nDAVROS: Diseases which human scientists have cured?\nWILLIS: Not everyone can afford the drugs. People like Baynes\nWILLIS: would say that the galaxy is overpopulated anyway, it's good if there's something that eases that pressure.\nDAVROS: Baynes has said that?\nWILLIS: No. Well, he might have done. I don't know.\nDAVROS: He wouldn't say that if it was his life at risk, would he?\nWILLIS: No, sir. Davros... there are millions like me. People\nWILLIS: who hate the corporations, who think they are synonymous with greed. They've destroyed whole planets, stripped them bare. And for what? Just to fuel more growth, to generate more money.\nWILLIS: DAVROS The economic system of the galaxy is fundamentally flawed. The corporations could be a force for good, but they are compelled to fight one another.\nWILLIS: We've tried to highlight all that in our news service. But no one has ever come up with a better system.\nDAVROS: I'm sure they have. But the corporations have bought\nDAVROS: them off. Or had them killed. That is what absolute rulers do.\nWILLIS: Changing the economy of the whole galaxy just\nWILLIS: couldn’t happen. There have been scandals and crises, but the corporations always survive — or new ones take their place.\nDAVROS: Are all the people that think like you such defeatists?\nWILLIS: We can't beat the corporations. They control everything, employ everyone.\nDAVROS: I have the means to destroy them. Once and for all.\nWILLIS: You do?\nDAVROS: You understand how the stock market functions?\nWILLIS: Well... sort of. The basics.\nDAVROS: Explain them.\nWILLIS: Well, people with money invest that money in\nWILLIS: companies that they think will do well. People take risks, sometimes they rewarded, sometimes they are ruined.\nDAVROS: But it is the element of risk that's important?\nWILLIS: Well, yes. My father always said it was like horse racing: gambling, but with people's lives.\nDAVROS: Yes. And if you knew the outcome of each race\nDAVROS: beforehand, would it be gambling? (Beat) I can predict the stock market.\nWILLIS: You can?\nWILLIS: DAVROS With one equation. I have now checked the records for the last five hundred years. The formula holds. I can predict the price of any stock at any time, anywhere.\nWILLIS: That power would set me up for life. You. It would make you rich. More than rich.\nDAVROS: If I was the only person to have the equation. WILLIS Of course. I mean, you wouldn't share it, would you?\nDAVROS: Why not?\nWILLIS: Because if everyone had the equation, then the whole system... would... collapse.\nDAVROS: Precisely.\nWILLIS: (Realising) You can do it.\nDAVROS: I will do it. But Ineed your help. This disk contains\nDAVROS: the equation, how the equation was devised, and a simple program that will run on even a household computer. Your job is to disseminate information — your news channel will run the equation.\nWILLIS: But there will be chaos.\nDAVROS: No. There will be a new order. A new economic\nDAVROS: model have designed for the galaxy. I alone will be prepared for the collapse the corporations. I will be able to use the TAI infrastructure to impose the new system.\nWILLIS: I imagine it would have to based on a loose, grass- roots system. A network of communes, committed to the environment of each world. Self-sufficient planets, but bartering goods if they have a surplus.\nDAVROS: I have been searching Mrs Baynes' history books to see if there is a precedent for what I am doing.\nWILLIS: Not on this scale. The main problem will be re-\nWILLIS: education — the human race has got so used to commerce, that a switch to the post-economic system, where people only take what they need will be difficult to adjust to.\nDAVROS: Essentially, the entire galactic economy will switch to a war footing. Criminals and undesirables will be put to work as labourers, those with particular aptitudes will form the elite, and will be granted limited rights. Those in the middle, the citizens, will provide a workforce. The women will produce and rear children, the men will work in new factories and in the armies, and all surplus production capacity will go into armaments —\nWILLIS: What? No! I won't be — hell... this damn door won't open for me. Let me out!\nDAVROS: Willis, you are intelligent and resourceful and I had\nDAVROS: hoped you would be in my new elite — subversives and troublemakers will suffer a rather different fate. Please don't disappoint me.\nWILLIS: Let me out!\nDAVROS: As you wish. (SFX: Door) But please think about my offer.\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.12 - WORKSHOP.\nDAVROS: Door.\nBAYNES: Doctor, hasn't Davros arrived yet?\nDOCTOR: He's not here.\nBAYNES: No. Hold on — (SFX: Radio bleep) Lorraine, are you\nBAYNES: with Davros?\nLORRAINE: — (Radio FX) No. I told you. Isn't he in the workshop?\nDOCTOR: He's not shown up. Look, I've made his tea for him and everything.\nWILLIS: (Radio. Upset) Doctor. Doctor, are you there? It's Willis.\nDOCTOR: Er. Yes. Hello Willis.\nBAYNES: (Whisper) So you two know each other, do you?\nDOCTOR: (Resigned whisper) We do.\nBAYNES: (Whisper) He's your — what's the word? — ‘companion’?\nDOCTOR: (Whisper) No, she's safe on the other side of the galaxy attending a botany symposium.\nWILLIS: Doctor? Are you there?\nBAYNES: (Whisper) Keep talking.\nDOCTOR: Willis, I'm right in the middle of something.\nWILLIS: Doctor, I have to talk to you.\nDOCTOR: We're talking now.\nWILLIS: Not over the radio.\nDOCTOR: Then come up here, I'm in workshop —\nWILLIS: No. Not in the Dome. They can see us. You come down here. I'm in the mines. (SFX: Radio bleep)\nWILLIS: BAYNES A resourceful young man. I thought I had him under control.\nDOCTOR: It's not Willis you should be looking out for, Baynes. He really is the least of your worries.\nBAYNES: Then let's go and see him. Get him out of the way. Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 3.13 -DOME/COMPUTER CHAMBER. Lift going up. KIM is humming. Chime and the lift slows and then the doors open. KIM's humming stops as she sees who it is.\nDAVROS: Good day.\nKIM: (Nervous) Hello. How can I help you?\nDAVROS: You are taking this lift to go to the computer centre?\nKIM: Yes. I'm a technician there.\nDAVROS: I will accompany you. If that is agreeable.\nKIM: Er... yes. Of course. My name is Kim. Kim Todd.\nKIM: Lift operates.\nDAVROS: I am Davros. How long have you worked at the computer centre, Miss Todd?\nKIM: Five years.\nDAVROS: Excellent. I have a project that requires me to upload files to the galactic datanet.\nKIM: I don't have that authority.\nDAVROS: If I had, would you be able to operate the communications terminal?\nKIM: Only Mr Baynes has that authority. We need tight security to prevent company secrets from being leaked.\nDAVROS: That was not my question.\nKIM: I have often helped Mr Baynes transmit files, yes. Door opens.\nDAVROS: Excellent. We appear to have arrived. Proceed. I will meet with you in a minute or so — I have business to attend to first.\nKIM: As you wish, Mister Davros.\nLORRAINE: Davros.\nDAVROS: Ah, Mrs Baynes. Good to see you again.\nLORRAINE: — (To DAVROS) My husband has been looking for you. You weren't in the workshop or with me. I thought you'd be heading here.\nLORRAINE: DAVROS An excellent deduction.\nLORRAINE: __ The way you were looking at that technician...\nDAVROS: She reminds me of somebody.\nLORRAINE: _— Shan?\nDAVROS: How...?\nLORRAINE: You mentioned her name before. So, who was she? Cut to:\nLORRAINE: SCENE 3.14 —- KALED CITY.\nSHAN: Coordinator Davros, I am Shan.\nDAVROS: Ah, yes, the latest recruit to Science Division. You are the same Shan who wrote a paper on the long-term effects of the atomic shelling?\nSHAN: That is right. You read that?\nDAVROS: I read every paper. (Beat) But that one was one of the\nDAVROS: few to impress me.\nSHAN: If the war continues much longer, the entire biosphere will be devastated.\nSHAN: DAVROS The Kaleds did not start the shelling.\nSHAN: Sir, it doesn't matter who drops the bombs, the poisons still enter the earth and the water supplies.\nDAVROS: Indeed.\nDAVROS: SHAN The Kaleds will win the war, but we could be left with a dead planet.\nDAVROS: DAVROS The inevitability of science\nSHAN: Nothing is inevitable, Davros. We shape our own destiny.\nDAVROS: That is not what your paper says.\nSHAN: My paper ends with a number of suggestions that —\nDAVROS: Shan, I know how your paper ends. A couple of\nDAVROS: piecemeal fixes that might just have some effect. But we both know what your real conclusion is.\nSHAN: Yes, sir. We have to adapt or die.\nDAVROS: We?\nSHAN: Life.\nDAVROS: Kaled and Thal?\nSHAN: I think we have gone beyond that.\nDAVROS: Yes. Do you think that is why the two races are trying to kill each other?\nSHAN: Sir?\nDAVROS: Do you think we know deep down that this is a\nDAVROS: suicidal war, whatever our political officers tell us? That every death just puts people out of their misery?\nSHAN: Sir, I believe there is a way to survive this.\nDAVROS: No.\nDAVROS: SHAN With respect, Coordinator: yes. I have prepared a new paper. One that proposes a solution.\nDAVROS: DAVROS An end to the war?\nSHAN: Not necessarily.\nDAVROS: I am a scientist, Shan. I spend most of my time\nDAVROS: developing weapons. But over the years I have given a great deal of thought to more radical solutions. It is clear to me that the only hope for the Kaleds is to cooperate with the Thals.\nSHAN: We are two different races in the same ecological niche, sir. Every biologwal imperative makes cooperation impossible. The Kaleds must destroy the Thal species for the sake of our own.\nDAVROS: Then your solution is some devastating weapon? Something even I have not conceived of?\nSHAN: No, sir. More radical than that.\nDAVROS: Tell me.\nSHAN: We are approaching the problem from the wrong angle.\nSHAN: DAVROS The problem is simple: prolonging the war will mean\nSHAN: that soon this world will not be able to support Kaled life. We lack the ability to leave this world — there are no other worlds that would support life in any case. The only solution is to end the fighting. And we cannot do that because our enemies will destroy us. Either way, the Kaled race is dead.\nSHAN: Yes. I agree with all of that.\nDAVROS: Yet you have a solution?\nSHAN: Yes.\nDAVROS: Tell me.\nSHAN: Read my new paper, sir.\nDAVROS: Does it have a title?\nSHAN: Yes sir. (Beat) I call it 'The Dalek Solution’ . DAVROS And this word... 'Dalek'. What does it mean? SHAN To discover that, sir, you will have to read the paper. Cut to:\nSHAN: SCENE 3.15 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nLORRAINE: _ So... you didn't create the Daleks?\nDAVROS: I created them. She proposed the idea, but I was the\nDAVROS: one that experimented on Kaled embryos. I told them the chemicals I\nDAVROS: was injecting them with would make their babies stronger. I didn't tell them that it would also make them change species.\nLORRAINE: You must have felt...\nDAVROS: Yes?\nLORRAINE: _ Idon't know. Guilt? Pride? Horror? I honestly don't\nLORRAINE: know. You were making a monumental decision, but —\nDAVROS: I felt nothing.\nLORRAINE: — You must have felt —\nLORRAINE: with a Dalek mutant's hissing instead of crying.\nDAVROS: I remember the first birth. The first live birth. The mother felt pride and anxiety. Have you got children, Mrs Baynes?\nLORRAINE: No.\nDAVROS: I imagine that what unites the humans, the Kaleds and the Thals is pride in the birth of a new child. The hope, the fear that something will go wrong. Nothing went wrong, as far as I was concerned. But —\nDAVROS: DAVROS The mothers often felt differently. Those few that, survived the shock of childbirth.\nLORRAINE: You were working to ensure the survival of life on your planet.\nLORRAINE: DAVROS A creature that could breath air thick with mustard gas, drink poisoned water, eat the crops that grew in plutonium dust.\nLORRAINE: _ A creature that could survive anywhere.\nDAVROS: Yes.\nLORRAINE: __ Those were your children.\nDAVROS: Yes.\nLORRAINE: This Shan. She was... she was one of the mothers?\nDAVROS: No. What gave you that idea?\nLORRAINE: __ [thought perhaps you and she were — ?\nDAVROS: She was beautiful, Mrs Baynes. Young. Strong. A brilliant mind. The first mind I encountered that was more brilliant than my own.\nLORRAINE: _ You loved her?\nDAVROS: I am not sure that I have ever loved, Mrs Baynes. I am\nDAVROS: not sure I have ever felt... anything.\nLORRAINE: _ But you are one of the most driven beings there is. The daleks have extreme emotional —\nDAVROS: I am not a Dalek. My life-support system perfectly regulates my body's functions. If I feel cold, it warms me. I feel hunger or tiredness, it neutralises them. At their root, all emotions are simple chemical responses. Fear, anger, jealousy. All can be regulated.\nLORRAINE: _ But this was before your accident. Before you had your life-support system?\nDAVROS: Yes. LORRAINE And still you felt nothing?\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.16 — KALED CITY.\nSHAN: Davros. You presented my paper to the Council.\nDAVROS: Yes. As Coordinator, that was my duty.\nSHAN: You didn't mention my name, though. You took all the credit.\nDAVROS: You work under me. All scientific research needs my approval.\nSHAN: You are a genius, Davros, there is no doubt about that.\nSHAN: But this has always been my specialism. I understood that I would be the one to present to the Council on this matter.\nDAVROS: It is a side issue.\nSHAN: It is the fundamental issue, Davros.\nSHAN: DAVROS The war is the only issue.\nSHAN: We both know that isn't true. You read my paper. I was the only person thinking about what happens afterwards.\nDAVROS: There won't be an afterwards. Not unless we win.\nSHAN: Even if we win there will not be an ‘afterwards’.\nSHAN: Already birth rates are falling, infant mortality is four times the level it was a generation ago.\nSHAN: DAVROS The inevitable consequence of war. Who would want to bring children into this world now? The women don't want to be mothers any more, they want to help with the war effort.\nSHAN: Are you telling me to shut up and start producing babies?\nDAVROS: Shan...\nSHAN: Is that all I... ?\nDAVROS: No. You are a great scientist, Shan. Perhaps the greatest this planet will produce.\nSHAN: Coordinator Davros, your own reputation is -\nDAVROS: Shush.\nSHAN: One day I may surpass you. But for now...\nDAVROS: You are always thinking of the future, Shan. I admire that.\nSHAN: Sir.\nDAVROS: Your ideas are ahead of their time. I think only you and I truly understand the implications. Others, those less than ourselves, will be scared by what you propose.\nSHAN: Sir, did you present all of my paper?\nDAVROS: I removed certain of your conclusions. The Council do not need to know everything. Not yet. They are politicians. They would not approve the new experiments if they knew... what we know.\nSHAN: That they are signing all our death warrants? That the new species will replace the original?\nDAVROS: Yes.\nDAVROS: Gut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.17 — MINES.\nBAYNES: These tunnels go on forever, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: This is a large complex, Baynes, but it's hardly infinite.\nBAYNES: That shaft we just passed is over fifteen miles deep.\nBAYNES: You fell down that, it would feel pretty infinite, believe me.\nEARPIECE: Doctor — Willis is twenty metres straight ahead.\nDOCTOR: Willis?\nWILLIS: (Distance) Doctor? (Coming closer) Doctor, it's good to see you. You're the only one I can trust. Even Kim...\nBAYNES: Kimberley Todd, the technician from the computer centre? She's in league with you, is she?\nWILLIS: Doctor, you betrayed —\nDOCTOR: He was in the room when you radioed me. And this\nDOCTOR: man is the only person we have to convince about Davros.\nWILLIS: But he's —\nDOCTOR: Whatever he is, Davros is worse.\nWILLIS: I know.\nBAYNES: Not another one. Davros has a shady past, I suppose, but he's put that behind him. If either of you have evidence, could you just tell me what it is?\nWILLIS: Davros is planning to destroy you.\nBAYNES: He couldn't if he tried. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve you know. And trading accusations isn't evidence, Willis.\nWILLIS: Not you personally — our whole economic system.\nDOCTOR: He told you this?\nWILLIS: I think he was trying to recruit me.\nBAYNES: Why would he do that?\nWILLIS: He needed me.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nBAYNES: Yes, why? I'd love to know.\nBAYNES: Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 3.18 — KALED CITY.\nSHAN: You sent for me, Davros?\nDAVROS: Coordinator Davros.\nSHAN: I meant no disrespect. Sir, I thought —\nDAVROS: You presumed, Shan. You presume too much.\nSHAN: Sir, have I done something wrong?\nDAVROS: Possibly, possibly not. You know Councillor Valron?\nSHAN: Yes, sir.\nDAVROS: You have been observed fraternising with him.\nSHAN: By whom, sir?\nDAVROS: It is my duty to know all the activities of my staff.\nSHAN: Sir, the Councillor and I have seen each other socially. But there is no rule against that. There's nothing wrong with it.\nDAVROS: Your work is suffering.\nDAVROS: SHAN With respect sir, no it isn't.\nDAVROS: How dare you?\nSHAN: How dare you, Coordinator? I have a relationship with the Councillor...\nDAVROS: You share a bed.\nSHAN: Sir, [have done nothing illegal, Coordinator Davros. More to the point I have done absolutely nothing wrong.\nDAVROS: I am concerned about the Councillor. I believe he has pro-Thal sympathies.\nSHAN: Coordinator, that is nonsense. He is one of the main advocates for the use of gas weapons against the Thals.\nDAVROS: You have discussed politics with him?\nSHAN: We have talked about the war, yes.\nDAVROS: You have told him what we have been doing here at\nDAVROS: Scientific Division? He knows about our work?\nSHAN: biosphere.\nDAVROS: it?\nSHAN: No, sir. He has read my paper on the future of Skaro's You discussed that? He asked about it. I answered some of his questions.\nSHAN: You took credit for the paper. You told him you wrote\nSHAN: Coordinator, I did write the paper. Every word. I had\nSHAN: reached the main conclusion before you and I met. Life as we know it on Skaro is doomed. Wait... how did you know what I said?\nDAVROS: sympathiser.\nSHAN: Thal shells.\nSHAN: You were observed.\nSHAN: Sir, that conversation took place in my personal berth. Indeed.\nSHAN: Councillor Valron and I had just —\nSHAN: Spare me the details.\nSHAN: Do I need to?\nSHAN: You must end this relationship with the Thal\nSHAN: Sir, Valron's entire family was wiped out by the first\nSHAN: Yet he survived. Do you not find that suspicious? No. Sir... this is ridiculous. I am returning to work.\nSHAN: Do what you will.\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: I fully intend to, Shan.\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.19 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nLORRAINE: the Councillor?\nLORRAINE: You... wait, I don't understand. Shan betrayed you to\nLORRAINE: No.\nLORRAINE: She was seeing him behind your back?\nLORRAINE: Pardon?\nLORRAINE: She was unfaithful to you?\nLORRAINE: Shan and I were not romantically involved.\nLORRAINE: But you loved her?\nLORRAINE: I told you: I am incapable of that.\nLORRAINE: That's what you told me, yes. But you also said she\nLORRAINE: was beautiful, that you admired her. That her mind rivalled your own.\nLORRAINE: It's the job of the historian to see the motivations and forces that drive events. Perhaps I see what you can not.\nDAVROS: I thought you said you didn't understand me. That you needed to hear it first hand. Shan said it herself — we were two creatures in the same evolutionary niche. Only one of us could be the greatest scientist.\nLORRAINE: What?\nDAVROS: It is the same throughout the universe — Thal and Kaled, Neanderthal and Homo sapiens. Only one could survive.\nLORRAINE: _ But what happened?\nDAVROS: I had collected my evidence. That which I couldn't collect, I created. I had Councillor Valron arrested for consorting with the enemy. All his associates were rounded up and executed.\nDAVROS: I smiled as I watched Shan hang. (Beat) Mrs Baynes?\nLORRAINE: _ But... she...\nDAVROS: It was her or me.\nLORRAINE: __ No. She was no threat to you.\nDAVROS: She would have been.\nLORRAINE: Notif-—\nDAVROS: Mrs Baynes, you don't see it, do you? You don't see\nDAVROS: the same patterns occurring and reoccurring throughout my history? Throughout all history? The solutions, too, are always the same. Radical solutions require ruthless action against those who would block them.\nLORRAINE: _ The Doctor says you are a monster.\nDAVROS: Ah yes, the Doctor. My equal. My rival. For a moment I didn't believe him. I thought I could change.\nLORRAINE: You haven't?\nDAVROS: I can't. I see that now. Talking to you about history and destiny and patterns and motivations has given me a new perspective. I see now that it's like those corpses in the food rendering plants. We can disguise nature, but we can't change it.\nLORRAINE: People can change. Rectify their past mistakes.\nDAVROS: I made no mistakes.\nLORRAINE: _ Shan. If you had your time again, wouldn't you go back and save her?\nDAVROS: No.\nLORRAINE: _ But your nightmares. The guilt. The shame you've felt.\nDAVROS: Simple chemical responses. Ones that drove me to survive, drove me to create. I would do it again in a moment. If I had not destroyed her, she would have destroyed me. (Beat) Which reminds me...\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.20 — MINES.\nBAYNES: Davros is wrong. You can't just sum up the economy of the galaxy on one computer disk.\nDOCTOR: He's a genius.\nBAYNES: He's an engineer, not an accountant.\nWILLIS: You can't take the risk he's right. He'll destroy everything.\nBAYNES: I thought that's what you and your subversive friends have always wanted.\nBAYNES: WILLIS The corporations are bad — but what Davros is planning is much worse.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don't tell me. He sees the galaxy as one big concentration camp, with him as the commandant?\nWILLIS: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Can you imagine it, Baynes? Every one of those\nDOCTOR: factories of yours producing weapons. Warships, armies of combat robots and tanks. Every skyline full of smoking chimneys, every worker a slave?\nWILLIS: He can imagine it, all right. That's what he's always wanted.\nBAYNES: No! I only want what's best for people.\nWILLIS: For you.\nBAYNES: I got where I am by making people's lives better. By employing people, by selling them what they want.\nDAVROS: (Radio) I hate to interrupt this fascinating discussion.\nDOCTOR: Davros! Where's that voice coming from?\nBAYNES: Your pocket, I think, Mr Willis.\nWILLIS: What?\nDAVROS: (Radio) Getting warmer, Mr Willis.\nWILLIS: Here.\nDOCTOR: What have you got there?\nDAVROS: (Radio) I fitted a radio in that little gift I gave you.\nBAYNES: What is it?\nDOCTOR: It's a bomb, Mr Baynes. A nuclear bomb.\nBAYNES: What the hell?\nWILLIS: Don't play the innocent. Davros gave me this —\nDOCTOR: Davros gave it you?\nWILLIS: It belongs to you, Baynes — Davros gave it to me to show that you're up to no good.\nBAYNES: I've never seen this thing before in my life. They're illegal. Immoral. What use would I have for a nuclear bomb?\nDAVROS: (Radio) Oh, you'll find they are very versatile. With this one, I plan to kill three birds with one stone.\nBAYNES: I swear I had nothing to do with this.\nDAVROS: (Radio) He didn't, Willis. I'm afraid I built it this\nDAVROS: morning. I faked the evidence. I believe you journalists would call it a ‘smoking gun’.\nWILLIS: Look, there's no need to worry. Davros said this thing was useless without the trigger.\nDOCTOR: Willis — do you know what a trigger for a nuclear bomb looks like?\nWILLIS: Well, no, but —\nDOCTOR: Hand me that. See here? Trigger. There, you've learned something new today.\nWILLIS: Oh.\nWILLIS: Cut to:\nWILLIS: SCENE 3.21 - COMPUTER CHAMBER.\nDAVROS: (Cackling) Don't imagine you can defuse it,\nLORRAINE: __ Doctor. Davros, what are you doing?!\nDOCTOR: (Radio) Davros, whatever you want, we can talk.\nBAYNES: Lorraine — stop him.\nDAVROS: You've always known what I want, Doctor. I tried to change, I really thought I could. But you were right.\nDOCTOR: (Radio) Scant consolation.\nDAVROS: No. I will miss you, Doctor. (Cackles) A nuclear\nDAVROS: bomb, on the other hand... well, it can't miss you at that range.\nDAVROS: SCENE 3.22 — MINES.\nDOCTOR: He's activated the detonation sequence. Quick!\nBAYNES: We can't outrun a nuclear blast, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (Some way off) You stay here.\nWILLIS: What's he doing?\nBAYNES: He's going back to that shaft. He's going to drop the\nBAYNES: bomb down there, hope it drops far enough that —\nBAYNES: followed by the crackling of rocks and boulders falling. The explosion continues to rumble and echo. Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 3.23 - COMPUTER CHAMBER.\nBAYNES: radio link.\nLORRAINE: — What have you done? What have you done?\nDAVROS: (Insane laughter)\nDAVROS: End of Part Three"

Can catch breath.\nWILLIS: Where's all this water coming from?\nBAYNES: These mines are built over a lake — a reservoir. The explosion must have fractured the rocks.\nWILLIS: You tunnelled under a lake?\nBAYNES: Two miles under, yes.\nWILLIS: Two miles? We're two miles underground?\nBAYNES: We're deeper than that, here.\nWILLIS: We'll never get out.\nBAYNES: Not on our own. But they'll send a rescue team.\nWILLIS: Will they? Or will they just assume we're already dead?\nBAYNES: They wouldn't do that.\nWILLIS: You did, with the Doctor.\nBAYNES: (Unconvinced) Not the same thing.\nBAYNES: below.\nBAYNES: It's not slowing down.\nWILLIS: I think the water might be getting faster. BAYNES At least it's not rising on this level.\nWILLIS: I don't think a rescue team could survive down here.\nBAYNES: Heh. You know what the irony is? If you and the Doctor hadn't sabotaged that robot, they could have sent it. It would have survived — and it was smart enough to get down here and get us out. We had fifty of them, ready to go — but they're deactivated.\nWILLIS: I think we can stay on this ledge. It's big enough, it's not too wet. There's drinking water.\nBAYNES: Plenty of it.\nWILLIS: There's only so much water in a lake.\nBAYNES: Millions of gallons.\nWILLIS: Yeah, but look at the speed of that flow — and this isn't\nWILLIS: the only tunnel. It's got to start running out in a couple of hours, at most.\nWILLIS: BAYNES And this is a big mine. The water will flood the lower levels, but it won't rise this far.\nWILLIS: You're sure?\nWILLIS: BAYNES Of course I'm not sure. But I'm pretty sure. So, what will you do when you get up to the surface?\nWILLIS: I'll worry about that when I get there.\nBAYNES: Will you make your report about my company?\nWILLIS: Look...\nBAYNES: Will you expose me?\nWILLIS: This is hardly the time or place.\nBAYNES: It's exactly the time and place.\nWILLIS: Wait, what are you doing? (Cries out)\nBAYNES: If you had died down here, in the explosion, no one would ever know.\nWILLIS: I won't tell anyone, I won't tell anyone.\nBAYNES: No. No, you won't.\nWILLIS: screams as he falls to a watery death. We hear him crying out as he's swept away in the torrent.

Have we permission to evacuate the Dome?\nDAVROS: No. The Dome is to remain sealed. Stay at your workstations. Everything is under control.\nVOICE: 3 Of course, sir. Of course.\nDAVROS: Listen to your earpieces. They will tell you everything you need to know.\nDAVROS: Gut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.5 — MINES.\nEARPIECE: (Calm, as ever) Doctor, you are hanging from a precipice. A large volume of water is falling to your left. There are dangerous fissures in the local geology.\nDOCTOR: (Aggravated) Shut up! Please, shut up! I do know all this. If you can't help, then shut up!\nEARPIECE: I am currently unable to call for help.\nDOCTOR: (He scrabbles around and hoists himself up with some exertion) Phew. Made it. (Breaths deeply for a second, then:) Now, what are the radiation levels like?\nEARPIECE: Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.\nDOCTOR: Only slightly? Are you sure?\nEARPIECE: Checking. Yes. The levels in the upper caverns of this mine are well above human tolerance, but in the lower caverns, the level is only slightly higher.\nEARPIECE: DOCTOR The water is washing away the dangerous particles down here, but above the water level there's still a radiation cloud. EARPIECE The facts would support your theory.\nDOCTOR: These mines lie below the Dome?\nEARPIECE: Correct.\nEARPIECE: DOCTOR And the radiation cloud is rising?\nEARPIECE: Correct.\nDOCTOR: How long before the radiation cloud reaches the Dome?\nEARPIECE: It already has.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.6 - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM.\nLORRAINE: _— Kim-— don't send that message.\nKIM: Davros has ordered me to.\nLORRAINE: Don't. It will mean chaos. Hand me the disk.\nKIM: Here. Do we tell Davros?\nKIM: LORRAINE Of course not. Kim, we must be able to do something for those people outside in the Dome. They're dying. We must be able to get medical supplies to them.\nKIM: Open the doors and we'll flood the computer centre with radiation. We'll die.\nLORRAINE: _ Then open the outside doors. Let them leave the\nLORRAINE: Dome.\nKIM: We can't. We're at full defensive alert. The computer won't let us.\nLORRAINE: — You must be able to reprogram it.\nKIM: No, ma'am. Your husband insisted on it. If we try to\nKIM: open the doors, now, they'll fuse shut automatically. It would take a day with a fusion torch to cut them open.\nLORRAINE: __ Then all those people will die.\nKIM: Your husband might have known a way round the computer — but if he did, the secret died with him.\nLORRAINE: —  (Sobs)\nLORRAINE: KIM With respect, ma'am, it's a little late for tears, now, we should —\nLORRAINE: Door.\nDAVROS: Miss Todd. The message has been sent?\nKIM: Yes, Davros.\nDAVROS: Miss Todd, you are aware that I don't have eyes. I lost them in the accident that crippled me.\nKIM: Sir?\nKIM: DAVROS The explosion burst my eardrums, seared off most of the nerves in my skin, destroyed my sense of smell and hearing.\nKIM: I don't understand.\nDAVROS: I compensated. Built a camera eye and microphones\nDAVROS: that are delicate scientific instruments. Designed sensors that give me acute awareness of my surroundings.\nKIM: Er, yes, sir.\nKIM: DAVROS And I can sense your heartbeat, hear you perspiring, see the fear in your voice. You are lying to me.\nKIM: No. I-\nDAVROS: You are lying.\nKIM: Yes.\nKIM: High-pitched noise starts building.\nDAVROS: I'm the CEO of this company, now. I control everything.\nDAVROS: KIM Of course, Davros. I understand. What's that noise?\nLORRAINE: _— [don't hear anything. The sound is getting painful to listen to.\nDAVROS: That, Miss Todd, is your earpiece. It's playing a frequency that the human brain finds extremely painful.\nKIM: Agh! Davros, please stop!\nDAVROS: You lied to me.\nKIM: I'm sorry! Davros. Please.\nLORRAINE: You're killing her!\nDAVROS: Yes.\nLORRAINE: You need her to send the message! She's indispensable.\nLORRAINE: The noise stops abruptly.\nDAVROS: Ah... yes.\nKIM: (Collapses)\nDAVROS: What's the matter with her?\nLORRAINE: _ She's unconscious. Sensory overload.\nDAVROS: Weak creature! How long before she recovers?\nLORRAINE: __ A few minutes at most.\nDAVROS: So be it. [have work to do in the main computer\nDAVROS: room. Inform me when she has regained consciousness. And warn her that the next time she disobeys me, she dies — it won't take me long to learn how to perate the communications terminal. The graveyards are\nDAVROS: full of the indispensable, Mrs Baynes. Lorraine. Remember that.\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.7 — MINES.\nEARPIECE: (Crackling — bad signal) All personnel remain at your posts. There is no reason to be alarmed. Your earpieces will keep you informed. Do you want me to repeat the message?\nDOCTOR: (Out of breath) No, I got it the first time.\nEARPIECE: You should return to the Dome. Please leave the mines and head for Hatch Alpha Four.\nDOCTOR: I am trying to leave the mines. That is precisely what I have been trying to do for the last twenty minutes! The rockfalls and millions of gallons of fast-flowing, freezing cold water are slowing me down a bit. I've managed to get up thirty levels. Frankly, that's more than most people could have done.\nEARPIECE: Once out of the mines...\nDOCTOR: Please shut up.\nBAYNES: (Distance) Doctor? Doctor, is that you?\nEARPIECE: That is Arnold Baynes, former CEO of TransAlliedInc.\nDOCTOR: Former CEO?\nBAYNES: (Closer) What did you say?\nDOCTOR: Yes — what did you say, again?\nEARPIECE: That is Arnold Baynes, former CEO of TransAlliedInc.\nDOCTOR: Fascinating.\nBAYNES: Doctor, are you talking to yourself? DOCTOR To this earpiece thing.\nBAYNES: It still works down here? Fantastic!\nDOCTOR: Hardly the word I'd use.\nBAYNES: Those are great products. Every corporation uses them.\nDOCTOR: Yes — but I'm guessing you don't have one. BAYNES The CEO doesn't need one.\nDOCTOR: You're not the CEO.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES Of course I am.\nDOCTOR: Computer, tell me: who is the CEO of TransAlliedInc?'\nEARPIECE: Davros.\nBAYNES: What did it say?\nDOCTOR: You know the answer to that already. Never mind that\nDOCTOR: —I found Willis.\nBAYNES: You did? What did he say?\nDOCTOR: (Suspicious) Say? He was dead. Looked like a broken neck.\nBAYNES: Right. How did you survive the bomb going off?\nDOCTOR: By dropping it down that mineshaft and running very, very fast before it went off.\nBAYNES: We have to get back up to the surface.\nDOCTOR: We also have to be careful of the radiation levels.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.8 - COMPUTER CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: dome personnel dying. Things like: 'Help us... radiation sickness... sir, tree people in our section have collapsed... please open the outer doors... send for help... request medical teams.' Oblivious, DAVROS is recording a message. Door — LORRAINE enters.\nDAVROS: This is TAI control to all regional managers. Attached to this message is an operational plan that will allow TAI to thrive in the new galactic order. All assets of rival corporations are to be seized or destroyed. All enemy senior management executives are to be arrested and detained. Further instructions will follow. This is a glorious time in the history of the universe — one that favours the bold and the ruthless. Remember the new TAI mission statement — 'Exterminate the opposition. TAI shall be the supreme authority in the galaxy.' (Beat) Ah... Lorraine. Has Miss Todd recovered?\nLORRAINE: _ No. I think that will be another ten minutes or so.\nDAVROS: Then you must help me.\nLORRAINE: __ That message you were recording. There was a problem.\nDAVROS: (Threatening) A... problem?\nLORRAINE: __ I mean the voices. Listen.\nLORRAINE: They stay quiet — we hear the monitors clearly, people sounding distressed. After a moment, LORRAINE breaks the silence.\nLORRAINE: _ The regional managers will hear that in the background.\nDAVROS: Yes. [had grown used to the sound I didn't notice it. But you are right, I will need to re-record my message. Let me turn this\nDAVROS: off — SFX — or rather the lack of one — the voices shut off:\nDAVROS: There. Now, you are to liquidate all TAI shares and savings. The money is to be used to buy armaments and to hire mercenaries.\nLORRAINE: __ [I'll prepare the instructions.\nDAVROS: Sell high, buy low, Mrs Baynes. The first rule of the stock market. TAI shares are at a record price — by the end of the week, as my program spreads like a virus, there will be no financial system. Shares will be worthless, money — both electronic and paper — will be meaningless. And I will be the only one placed to take advantage.\nLORRAINE: Yes, Davros.\nDAVROS: Do not worry — there will always be a place in my organisation for a loyal servant. You are a loyal servant, I take it? LORRAINE Of course, Davros.\nDAVROS: Excellent. I will be in the communications room. You will wait here. Watch television, if you want. Here, I'll put the sound back on.\nDAVROS: The distressed voices come back on. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.9 — MINES/PEA CEFUL WOODLAND.\nDAVROS: birdsong.\nDOCTOR: Wait. You do see that sunlight?\nBAYNES: I see light.\nDOCTOR: Come on — I think we've reached the surface.\nBAYNES: I've no idea where we are. Miles from the Dome.\nDOCTOR: I think you're right. It's been a while since my earpiece said anything. Come on: help me move these rocks. BAYNES The radiation levels?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The radiation cloud was directly underneath the\nDOCTOR: Dome. If the Dome's as secure as you say it is, then the radiation will have risen into the Dome, where it'll be sealed in.\nBAYNES: All those people... Look, we won't be able to survive in there without radiation suits. Where are we going to get those? And Lorraine, all those workers. They'll be dead already.\nDOCTOR: Is there anywhere they could have barricaded themselves in?\nBAYNES: Yes... anyone in the computer centre will be safe from the radiation if they sealed it in time.\nDOCTOR: I bet they did, and I bet that's where Davros is. And he'd need your wife to confirm the transfer of your authority to him. At first, anyway.\nBAYNES: He'll want her around, anyway. He thinks he's making history — he'll want someone to record the moment.\nBAYNES: DOCTOR At last you're starting to realise the way his mind works.\nBAYNES: It's not that — hey, that's the reason I married an historian in the first place.\nBAYNES: DOCTOR And they say romance is dead. (To himself) Wait a minute, I recognise this place.\nBAYNES: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Nothing.\nBAYNES: Doctor, the situation's hopeless — the Dome's sealed\nBAYNES: and an entire battle fleet would take months to break in.\nDOCTOR: Well... we don't have months. Or a battle fleet. But we do have something Davros doesn't know about.\nBAYNES: We do?\nDOCTOR: Just through this clearing. There.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES A wooden hut?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A TARDIS, Mr Baynes. If you'll follow me?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.10 — TARDIS INTERIOR.\nBAYNES: Dimensionally transcendental. (Beat) A bit old- fashioned.\nBAYNES: Console bleeping.\nBAYNES: DOCTOR The TARDIS is far beyond human technology. I'll set\nBAYNES: us down in the Dome's computer centre.\nBAYNES: The TARDIS is now in flight.\nBAYNES: What about Davros?\nDOCTOR: Although we've met a few times, he's never actually seen the TARDIS. He knows nothing about it.\nDOCTOR: BAYNES And what he doesn't know can hurt him?\nDOCTOR: Well, he won't be expecting it.\nBAYNES: We're landing already?\nDOCTOR: Uh-huh. In a small room a little way from the main computer control chamber. Radiation levels normal. Let's take a look outside.\nDOCTOR: Scanner operates.\nBAYNES: Lorraine!\nDOCTOR: Come on.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.11 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nDOCTOR: and the distressed voices on the monitors.\nBAYNES: Lorraine!\nLOBBAINE: (Verge of hysteria) We thought you were dead. Arnold it was horrible. Davros killed everyone in the Dome.\nBAYNES: Turn that noise off, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: That won't make the problem go away.\nDOCTOR: The distressed voices mute.\nBAYNES: I know, we — Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Just inspecting this computer. Don't mind me.\nLORRAINE: _ Hejust sat there, watching the monitors. Watching everyone dying from radiation burns. He was laughing at it.\nDOCTOR: He's got more in mind than mere sadism. Has he broadcast the contents of that disk?\nLORRAINE: __ No. Wait — I have the disk here.\nBAYNES: He could be rich if he kept this to himself.\nDOCTOR: I'll take that, if you don't mind.\nBAYNES: Wait a second — how do I know you won't use it? You're no fan of the corporations.\nDOCTOR: If the corporations fall, so does human civilisation.\nDOCTOR: Who'll fly the supply ships, or run weather control? Who'll grow the food and clear ear up the waste? Who'll run the hospitals? There will be anarchy, all across the galaxy. Worse than anarchy. Remember what Willis told us, Baynes — Davros is ready to step into the breach. We\nDOCTOR: have to stop him. Just... just give me a moment.\nBAYNES: I'm not waiting for you. Dispenser — authorisation Baynes Alpha, I want a shotgun and plenty of ammunition for it.\nLORRAINE: ~~ What are you doing?\nLORRAINE: Dispenser dispenses a shotgun. BAYNES loads and pumps it.\nBAYNES: What does it look like?\nDOCTOR: Baynes, just wait a — Door.\nDOCTOR: ( Beat ) — moment.\nLORRAINE: — What's more important than Davros? Why aren't you trying to stop him?\nDOCTOR: I'm activating those new robots. I'm programming them to save as many people as they can in the Dome. A million lives are worth saving, don't you think?\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.12 — KALED CITY. We can hear crowds baying for blood outside.\nSHAN: Davros, please, have mercy.\nDAVROS: It's too late for that, Shan. Can't you hear the crowds?\nSHAN: Why are you doing this? Just tell me.\nDAVROS: Oh, if you're so clever, you can work it out for yourself.\nSHAN: I can't. I've been trying to think what I've said or done,\nSHAN: but I can't think of one reason. I've done good work for you. I've done nothing but sing your praises.\nSHAN: DAVROS The future, Shan. What of the future?\nSHAN: I... I don't know.\nDAVROS: I will be the greatest scientist in Skaro history.\nDAVROS: Pause.\nSHAN: No.\nDAVROS: What?\nSHAN: That's not it. You know how science works — we build\nSHAN: on the work of others. We challenge the established order, we take another scientist's theory and develop it. There's questioning, progress. That's what science is. Your place in history is already assured — whatever I would have done, it couldn't have diminished your achievements. It's something else.\nSHAN: No. You don't even know yourself, do you? You don't\nSHAN: understand why you feel the way you do.\nSHAN: I don't feel. 1am not weak. You sound scared of yourself. Why are you even here\nSHAN: talking to me? You don't need to see the condemned prisoner.\nDAVROS: =\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.13 - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM.\nDAVROS: Door.\nDAVROS: Uh! I still haven't managed to... (Groggy) Eh?\nDAVROS: Miss Todd. Get up.\nDAVROS: (Weak) Yes, Davros.\nDAVROS: Broadcast the contents of that disk. Yes, of course.\nDAVROS: Soon the galaxy will tremble.\nDAVROS: Baynes? You survived?\nBAYNES: Not so clever, now, eh?\nBAYNES: You hesitate, Mr Baynes.\nBAYNES: Give me the formula.\nBAYNES: What?\nBAYNES: We both know the Doctor's going to beat you.\nBAYNES: The Doctor is dead.\nBAYNES: I survived, so did the Doctor.\nBAYNES: You're bluffing.\nBAYNES: You know I'm not. Look: I'm finished here — you've\nBAYNES: ruined me. But give me the formula, and I'll get us both away before the authorities arrive.\nBAYNES: You have a ship? I've a concealed hangar with a ship waiting. You can\nBAYNES: get there in the lift, even with the computer centre sealed, if you know\nBAYNES: the entry code.\nDAVROS: Tic8€G; Give me the formula. I was planning to give everyone the formula.\nBAYNES: Yes, but that only works if you are in control of TAI. If you're on your own when galactic civilisation collapses, you'll be in the same boat as the rest of us. Look — the Doctor is going to win this battle. But you can still get away, if you play it my way. If we keep the formula to just ourselves, we'll be rich.\nDAVROS: You underestimate me, Baynes. Do you think you're the first person to point a gun at me?\nBAYNES: I'll be the last unless you give me that disk.\nDAVROS: No. Tell me — what's the access code to that hangar?\nBAYNES: I'm not going to —\nBAYNES: (Screams)\nBAYNES: Cut to:\nBAYNES: SCENE 4.14 - COMPUTER ROOM.\nBAYNES: (Screams, muffled)\nLORRAINE: ~— What's happening?\nDOCTOR: Davros. It's what he does.\nLORRAIN: He did something like that to Kimberly Todd. But... she was wearing an earpiece. Arnold doesn't have one. So how is he...?\nDOCTOR: I'll stop it, whatever it is.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.18 — KALED CITY.\nDAVROS: (No modulation) You didn't understand, Shan. You could never understand. I am unique. Laws are mine to create, not to follow.\nDOCTOR: She understood that you're nothing but a spoilt child\nDAVROS: (Splutters) Doctor? You're dead. Baynes is wrong. I killed you. (Quickly recovers) Of course. I survived a nuclear explosion. I should not be surprised that you have.\nDOCTOR: I'm in rather better shape than you.\nDAVROS: (Modulated) I like to think of myself as a self-made man.\nDOCTOR: Very good, Davros. You should be a stand-up\nDOCTOR: comedian. (Beat) No offence. Just one thing...\nDAVROS: (Modulated) What? DOCTOR The explosion that crippled you. It's not happened yet.\nDAVROS: (Modulated) What?\nDOCTOR: Look around you. This is Kaled City. This is the day Shan was executed. That was ages before the Thal shelling.\nDAVROS: (Modulated) That is... that (unmodulated) is true. I'm not in my chair. Not yet. I wasn't until you came in... but...\nDOCTOR: You're malfunctioning, Davros. Your clockwork's winding down, your batteries are going flat.\nDAVROS: No.\nDOCTOR: You're seeing things, now. Like me — if I'm dead how\nDOCTOR: could I be in this room? The parts of your memory you've replaced with a computer have corrupted. You can't trust the inputs from your camera eye, or any of those other sensors of yours.\nDAVROS: No. This is... this is part of the malfunction. The self- repair circuits are malfunctioning. That is all.\nDOCTOR: If you refuse to believe the evidence of your own electronic eye...\nDOCTOR: DAVROS A simple calibration. That is all that is needed.\nDOCTOR: Your problems are more serious than — (DOCTOR's voice fizzes out)\nDAVROS: There.\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.16 - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Baynes. Baynes, can you hear me?\nBAYNES: (Groans) Destiny. It's destiny.\nDOCTOR: You're going to be all right. Kim help me.\nKIM: (In shook). I can't. I... I watched him...\nDOCTOR: He's dead.\nDOCTOR: DAVROS A pity, I would have preferred to prolong his agony.\nDOCTOR: Wait. No. No... this is still not right.\nDOCTOR: What's up with him? He seems confused about something.\nKIM: I don't know. I... Doctor, what Davros did was horrible. He just pointed at Mr Baynes and... like electricity... just...\nDAVROS: (Gutting across this) You're dead, Doctor.\nDAVROS: Yet here I am. The nuclear bomb went off. You and Baynes are dead.\nDAVROS: That is categorical fact. If I can see you, then that must mean you are both part of the malfunction.\nDOCTOR: Therefore all elephants are pink. You only managed to\nDOCTOR: kill one man: Willis, and he didn't even die in the explosion. It's quite the most inefficient use of a nuclear weapon I've ever seen.\nDOCTOR: lost.\nKIM: So you really are alive? I stand here before you. Come on, Davros — you've\nKIM: No. Miss Todd, kindly broadcast my message. I... can't.\nKIM: What?\nKIM: I gave the disk to Mrs Baynes.\nDOCTOR: Davros, no!\nDOCTOR: She dies unless you get me that disk. Here.\nDOCTOR: You had it already? Of course you did. Release Kim. Release Kim, or I'll —\nDOCTOR: He picks up the shotgun and pumps it.\nDAVROS: Ah, we've been here before, Doctor. We both know\nDAVROS: you won't shoot me.\nDOCTOR: You're right. But... well —\nDOCTOR: terminal.\nDAVROS: I've no qualms about shooting a communication\nDAVROS: Like I said, you've lost, Davros.\nDAVROS: No.\nDAVROS: Davros...\nDAVROS: Don't take another step or this young lady dies. It's a\nDAVROS: poison injector, Doctor. A Kaled device for killing terminally ill patients. I was handed it a long time ago. I never used it, but I kept it with me. I have never forgotten.\nDOCTOR: I'm putting the gun down.\nDOCTOR: DAVROS Of course you are. Miss Todd — spacecraft communication systems, do they not?\nDOCTOR: KIM Of course...\nDOCTOR: Door.\nDAVROS: Then if you would follow me to the lifts. (Savage)\nDAVROS: Not a step, Doctor. (Beat) Oh, and Doctor — Baynes wasn't answering your question. He was answering mine.\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.17 - COMPUTER CHAMBER. DAVROS and KIM make their way from one side of the audio field to the other.\nLORRAINE: _ Kimberly! What's happened to my husband?\nDAVROS: Don't stop. Move! Get to the lift.\nKIM: I'm moving, I'm moving.\nKIM: Lift doors slide shut, we hear the lift operating. A moment later the\nDOCTOR: runs in from the other side.\nDOCTOR: Out of the way, Mrs Baynes.\nLORRAINE: Davros has just taken the lift down to —\nDOCTOR: Five inches of copper wire.\nLORRAINE: __ Icansee that.\nDOCTOR: If I place one end there, one there —\nDOCTOR: Short circuit and the lift doors fly open.\nLORRAINE: There's no lift there.\nDOCTOR: You wait for the next one. I'll catch up with Davros.\nLORRAINE: — Catch up, but how?\nDOCTOR: Gravity, Mrs Baynes. Grav...i...ty....\nDOCTOR: Tie throws himself down the liftshaft as he's saying it. Cut to:\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.18 — LIFT. Lift operating.\nKIM: Where do you want to go, sir?\nDAVROS: Executive Hangar Bay, Miss Todd.\nKIM: I need to input the password.\nDAVROS: (Savouring the word) Destiny.\nKIM: (Punching it in) D-e-s-t-i-n-y. Confirmed.\nDAVROS: Keep hold of that disk, Miss Todd.\nKIM: Yes, Davros.\nDAVROS: I would carry it myself, but as you see, my hand is full.\nKIM: I'll do whatever you say. Just please don't kill me.\nDAVROS: Soon the whole galaxy will.\nDAVROS: There's a large clump as the DOCTOR lands on the roof of the lift car.\nDAVROS: What was that?\nKIM: I don't know.\nDAVROS: Stay close to me.\nKIM: Sir.\nKIM: SCENE 4.19 - HANGAR BAY.\nKIM: Lift door opens.\nDAVROS: Move towards the ship. Stay close to me.\nDAVROS: KIM Of course\nDAVROS: We hear the DOCTOR clump down.\nDAVROS: Wait.\nDOCTOR: Uh-oh.\nDAVROS: Ah, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Davros. Thought I'd drop in.\nDAVROS: Trying to prevent my getaway? Are you still wearing that earpiece?\nDOCTOR: Er... yes. Thankfully it's been quiet for a while, but — High-pitched noise, building.\nDOCTOR: DAVROS At what frequency does a Time Lord brain liquefy?\nDOCTOR: It's a while since I've had the chance to do some practical scientific research.\nDOCTOR: (Struggling a bit) You'll have to do better than that.\nDAVROS: Really? How about this?\nDAVROS: The noise changes pitch and the teeth of half the listeners fall out — this is a really unpleasant, blackboard-scraping noise.\nDOCTOR: (Groans) Keep going. Keep going.\nDOCTOR: The noise reaches a pitch and then the earpiece burns out.\nDOCTOR: Ow! I think my earpiece just popped.\nDAVROS: Take another step forward and Miss Todd — Kim — dies.\nDOCTOR: You've caused enough destruction.\nDAVROS: There's no such thing as too much destruction.\nDOCTOR: Is that really the only way you can feel powerful, Davros? By killing and smashing things?\nDAVROS: Feel? I don't feel anything.\nKIM: You laughed as you watched Baynes and all those people in the Dome die.\nDAVROS: I laughed because this is so... easy. Humans value\nDAVROS: their lives and their feelings and their money and their security. It's nothing. It's worth nothing. None of this is worth anything. That is true power, Doctor. The power of life and death.\nDOCTOR: But you haven't got that power. You can't die — heaven knows, people have tried. And you can't kill yourself — you're had that injector with you since your accident, but despite every crime you’ve committed and atrocity you've unleashed, however guilty you've felt, you never used it. You pretend to be a machine to avoid the problem. You don't have any choice, do you? You have to survive. At\nDOCTOR: any price.\nDAVROS: No. I can destroy you, Doctor. Like I destroyed everyone in the Dome.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well, I saved them. Not all of them, sadly, but\nDOCTOR: almost all of them. I used the robots, and when the robots are finished there, they've got orders to come for you. Now... it's simple logic. If the power of life and death is what makes you so superior, but you don't have that power and I do... well, a mind of your calibre can work out the only conclusion.\nDAVROS: You haven't won yet. Kim, open that hatch. Hatch opens.\nDOCTOR: If you want a hostage, take me, not her.\nKIM: Doctor, no!\nDOCTOR: She's done nothing wrong. Take me.\nDAVROS: No.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nDAVROS: Because you want me to.\nDAVROS: Lift door opens.\nDAVROS: Ah, Mrs Baynes. Come to see me off?\nLORRAINE: You... you... (impotent fury)\nDAVROS: Inside the ship, Kim.\nKIM: (Struggles a little)\nKIM: SCENE 4.20 —- BAYNES'S INTERCEPTOR.\nDAVROS: Sit there.\nKIM: Where will you... oh.\nDOCTOR: (Radio) You're beaten, Davros.\nDAVROS: If that was true, Doctor, you wouldn't sound so\nDAVROS: panicked. Computer — voice control.\nCOMPUTER: = (Same voice as EARPIECE) Voice control.\nDAVROS: Launch this ship. Now!\nDAVROS: My equation will still be broadcast, Doctor. The galaxy will all. You have merely delayed my conquest, not ended it.\nDOCTOR: (Radio, but to KIM) Kim, can you stop him opening the hangar doors?\nDAVROS: Evidently not.\nDAVROS: Computer — I said launch this ship now!\nCOMPUTER: _ Engines now powered up. Launch in five, four, three, two, one...\nDOCTOR: (Radio, over this) Davros, there's no escape, you —\nDOCTOR: This lasts for a few seconds, then:\nDAVROS: I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn't quite catch that.\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.21 — HANGAR BAY.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Baynes, get down!\nLORRAINE: — Wecan control the ship.\nDOCTOR: What?\nLORRAINE: —= Quickly. You can access the computer from here. While it's in the planet's atmosphere, Dome Flight Control controls the ship. Basic safety feature.\nDOCTOR: This place is hardly the safest place to work.\nLORRAINE: — The computer's running on reduced power. It can't set a new course.\nDOCTOR: (Resigned) Of course it is. Right, I'll need to calculate a new trajectory in my head. (Beat) Actually, if you've got a piece of paper that might help.\nLORRAINE: This is a paperless organisation, Doctor. We pride ourselves on —\nDOCTOR: Oh shut up, will you and give me your hand.\nLORRAINE: My hand? Owl Hey! Ow!\nDOCTOR: Take the numbers I'm writing on it and enter them\nDOCTOR: into the computer.\nLORRAINE: ~~ What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Modifying the computer.\nLORRAINE: _ With your feet?\nDOCTOR: There are few universal truths, Mrs Baynes — one of\nDOCTOR: them is that every computer needs a good kicking from time to time.\nDOCTOR: There. How are you doing?\nLORRAINE: — Sequence entered. Now what?\nDOCTOR: Well, now we hope very hard that I know what I'm doing.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4.22 - BAYNES'S INTERCEPTOR.\nDAVROS: What is happening? Why has the ship changed course?\nCOMPUTER: ~The Dome controls atmospheric navigation, for your comfort and safety.\nDAVROS: Return this ship to manual control.\nKIM: It can't be done. Not until we leave the atmosphere. DAVROS The course change is keeping us in the atmosphere.\nDOCTOR: (Radio) Indeed it is. Odd that.\nDAVROS: No. I can get control of this ship. Emergency override.\nCOMPUTER: — Unable to comply.\nDAVROS: Damn you, Doctor, I'm not beaten yet.\nCOMPUTER: Warning — ship's computer is being hacked by an unknown source.\nDAVROS: I am extending the function of my chair's computer. It, allows me to directly interface my mind and the ship's function. Do you understand?\nCOMPUTER: = (More Daleky) I understand. I obey Davros.\nDAVROS: Emergency course change! Activate the hyperdrive now!\nDAVROS: Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.23 - HANGAR BAY.\nLORRAINE: _ [don't understand —\nDOCTOR: He's trying to activate the hyperdrive. If he does that, he'll fly out of the atmosphere.\nDOCTOR: LORRAINE And out of our control.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nKIM: (Radio) Doctor. Davros is planning to —\nDOCTOR: I know... I'm —\nKIM: (Radio) You control the ship. Crash it. Crash it into the planet's surface.\nDOCTOR: There's no need for —\nKIM: (Radio) You don't have time for anything else.\nCOMPUTER: = (Radio) I obey Davros. Hyperdrive powering up.\nKIM: (Radio) Now, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Kim, I can't —\nKIM: (Radio) Do it!\nKIM: SCENE 4.24 —- BAYNES'S INTERCEPTOR. The hyperdrive is building up.\nCOMPUTER: _ Hyperdrive in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one — And over this:\nDAVROS: Destiny, Doctor. Destiny.\nKIM: You said it.\nDAVROS: What? Give me that back.\nKIM: I'm not a coward like you. j,\nKIM: I've used the injector, Doctor. I'm dead either way. Do\nKIM: it!\nDOCTOR: (Radio) Oh... Kim.\nDAVROS: Wait. No. If this ship is pointing at the planet when the hyperdrive fires... No! Come back! Shan! Come back! (Screams) Heh. Lots of noise — DAVROS screams, the hyperdrive activates and the ship flies, very fast into the solid bedrock of the planet. There's a huge explosion, metal and rook and flame everywhere. It carries on for some time. Cut to:\nDAVROS: SCENE 4.25 - COMPUTER CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Space detectors registering a massive explosion. All signals from Davros's ship lost.\nLORRAINE: _ The hyperdrive fired. Davros is dead.\nDOCTOR: (Weary) No.\nLORRAINE: __ Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No, it doesn't work like that.\nLORRAINE: _ Doctor, according to what's left of the computers, the Dome has been decontaminated.\nDOCTOR: We'll... check up on everyone else in a moment. (Beat — weary) The formula died with Davros. The galactic economy is safe.\nLORRAINE: Minus TAI.\nDOCTOR: Minus your husband. But TAI has a chance to rebuild. It will get the chance to try — what was the expression? — a bit of blue- skies thinking.\nLORRAINE: Stay on. You could be the new Chief Executive.\nLORRAINE: DOCTOR On who's authority?\nLORRAINE: = Mine, I-\nDOCTOR: You are responsible for this, Mrs Baynes. You\nDOCTOR: revived Davros, it was your admiration for that vile creature that started all this.\nLORRAINE: You have no evidence of that. In fact, come to think\nLORRAINE: of it there is no evidence that Davros was ever here.\nLORRAINE: DOCTOR The press releases your husband put out —\nLORRAINE: __Faked, to discredit us. You don't have any tangible proof we actually had anything to do with capturing Davros's body.\nDOCTOR: Well, actually, yes Ido. When your interceptor returned with Davros, it must have switched to automatic flight control. Its flight was recorded in the Dome computers. Yes... there. All ships leave a trail in hyperspace — this one will lead straight to that freighter you raided. I imagine that you'll be arrested as soon as the authorities arrive. And I shall stay here to ensure it.\nLORRAINE: __ So, you think you've won Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Barely. People suffered and died because I didn't stop Davros earlier.\nLORRAINE: You really think Davros is alive?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. He survived. (Beat) People like him and me don't know any different.\nDOCTOR: End of Part Four\nREHABILITATION: OUTLINE By Lance Parkin\nREHABILITATION: A proposal for a Sixth Doctor, Peri and Davros story\nREHABILITATION: IN BRIEF 4 major corporation acquires Davros’s body and revives him. His scientific genius is just what they need to keep ahead of their rivals, Tbe charismatic bead of the corporation thinks be can control Davros, His wife thinks that Davros bas served bis time, and deserves a second chance. Davros is very taken with the idea of having a state-of-the-art laboratory, unlimited funds and the corporate talk of ‘eliminating the competition’. Only the Doctor can stand in bis way... which is probably why the corporation bas hired bim, too.\nREHABILITATION: Eh?\nREHABILITATION: This is a Doctor Who story, but one that focuses on Davros. Don’t worry, there will be pienty of Doctor - just as much as normal; more, tronically, than Revelation of the Daleks {1985 Doctor Who serial). But the ‘viewpoint’ will be that of Davros - the cliffbangers will see the Doctor threatening bim, not vice versa, for example. It'll be subtle stuff, a matter of opening and closing scenes in slightly different places - rather than start a scene with the Doctor about to open a door then stepping through, it would start with Davros, on the other side of the door, and the Doctor would step in. The advantages: we see more of Davros and whai makes bim tick (making the story an insight into bis psychology)... and we get to see a Doctor Who story more from the monster's point of view - see what it’s like to be on the receiving end of the Doctor's techniques.\nREHABILITATION: Tone - picking up cues from the dark comedy and satire of Revelation of the Daleks, particularly the Eleanor Bron bits, but mixed in with that the gangster chic stuff - Sexy Beast, something like that. Davros is out of jail and going straight, but falls in with bad company. And the vicious creature we know and love is never far from the surface. There are real-world dilemmas bere - the way the US used ex-Nazi scientists, say. The way countries often bave to use bad people to get their way, training them up and giving them resources - and how it often backfires. The way people glamourise crime and criminals, and ‘evil’. Davros’s supporters in this think they've got Marilyn Manson, something that’s a bit scary, but is fundamentally a commodity to be marketed... what they've actually got is Hitler: But, at least early on, there's also the idea that Davros could bave turned over a new leaf. By Revelation, be bas put an end to the galaxy’s famine, after all. Perbaps the Doctor is wrong...\nREHABILITATION: PART ONE\nREHABILITATION: Headhunters from the TransAlliedInc mining and electronics corporation learn that Davros has been recovered from his space station (this is between Resurrection of the Daleks [1984] and Revelation, and bridges that gap) and a ship is taking his remains back to Earth. They intercept the ship and bring him to their head office, on the colony world R-26.\nREHABILITATION: The TARDIS arrives on R-26.The Doctor has come to meet a retired mathematician friend of his, Todd. Peri’s not thrilled with the idea of this - until she discovers that he’s still in his twenties and very hunky. Mathematicians burn out early. Todd has been\nREHABILITATION: 386\nREHABILITATION: working on software for TAI - and he’s called the Doctor here because something odd is going on underneath the dome of TAI's HQ.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor, Peri and Todd watch as a shuttlecraft lands, but the security around the landing site means they can’t see what is going on.\nREHABILITATION: Baynes, the head of TAI, revives Davros and explains the situation - the galaxy is a competitive place. The big corporations need to grasp hold of every advantage to keep their position in the market. So, when there's a chance to hire one of the greatest scientific minds the universe has ever seen... well, you'd be a fool not to take it, wouldn't you? TAI have built an army of mining robots, which is stored in vast subterranean vaults, but they need Davros’s brilliance to make them the galaxy-beating product TAI demand. Davros initially resents the idea, but quickly realises the advantages when Baynes explains that TAJ’s influence spreads across the galaxy.\nREHABILITATION: Todd telis the Doctor and Peri that there are rumours that TAI is planning to close its mines on a dozen planets. They just aren’t cost effective. He’s been trying to arrange a workers’ buy-out, but TAI isn’t interested, and Todd’s earned himself a reputation as a troublemaker.\nREHABILITATION: Once inside the dome, the Doctor is shocked to see Davros and confronts Baynes - doesn't he realise that Davros is playing him for a fool? Does he even know who Davros is? The Doctor’s made to look a bit of an idiot - Baynes explains that, okay... Davros is the creator of the most evil race in the galaxy. No one’s perfect. No one ever got to the top without abandoning the odd principle here and there.\nREHABILITATION: Davros realises, though, that the Doctor is a threat to him. Baynes explains that Davros is a unique talent, and it's TAI’s duty to utilise his skills. Baynes’s wife tells the Doctor that they want to rehabilitate Davros. The Doctor insists they are playing with fire.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor explains that there is someone just as much of a genius as Davros, who'd be happy to work for him. Baynes isn’t sure who he means - Peri has to explain that the Doctor is offering his own services instead of Davros's.\nREHABILITATION: Baynes thinks about it - he’s got a better idea. Davros and the Doctor can work together. Neither the Doctor nor Davros are delighted at the prospect. Davros and the Doctor know that each seeks the destruction of the other...\nREHABILITATION: PART TWO\nREHABILITATION: Davros has already started work on improving the design for the mining robots. Much irony and suspicion ensues, but the new prototype robot isn’t at all like a Dalek - it’s barely sentient, and rather friendly. The Doctor remains suspicious.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor and Davros get their company passes and a brief induction talk. The Doctor is sceptical and scathing about all the corporate speak - ‘blue-skies thinking’, ‘galactic expansion’ ‘mission statements’ and so on - but Davros is fascinated, and thinks the corporation is very well run. Economics fascinates him - the wartime economy of Skaro seems much more sensible to him than the system of trading, supply and demand that dominates the galaxy.\nREHABILITATION: Davros is teacher’s pet - Mrs Baynes is fascinated by him, and invites him to dinner that night.\nREHABILITATION: Peri has to put up with the Doctor at his sulkiest - she'd much rather have been with Todd.\nREHABILITATION: The next day, the Doctor and Davros work together. It’s clear that the Doctor thinks Davros is up to something. More interesting, though, the Doctor and Davros have a great deal in common, and working together they quickly make a genuine scientific\nREHABILITATION: 387\nREHABILITATION: breakthrough. We get under the skin of both of them, see them as people. Davros suggests that this is the way to improve life in the galaxy, not the Doctor's disorganised freedom fighting.\nREHABILITATION: When the Doctor relates this to Peri, she wonders if... well... Davros might have a point.Todd sides with the Doctor - TransAllied are interested in profit, and nothing but profit. They work out what's going to happen - these new robot miners will put millions out of work.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor sneaks into the communications centre and deactivates the security - Todd calls a journalist friend of his. When she broadcasts the fact that Davros is working for TAI, Baynes will be ruined.\nREHABILITATION: Mrs Baynes tells Davros she wants to write a book about him. She’s convinced she can rehabilitate Davros. She’s got a real Lady Macbeth vibe ~- we get the clear sense she'd abandon her husband to side with Davros. Davros’s emotions are just as crippled as his body, and he doesn’t pick up on this.\nREHABILITATION: Davros meets with Todd, to hear his point of view. It’s Todd that looks like the extremist - he’s the one talking about the colony planets rising up against their leaders. Todd boasts that the rebels on the various planets are getting organised - TAI will have to reach a settlement.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor sneaks into the robot production line, intent on sabotaging the robot. He plants explosive charges. But the robot responds and moves to defends itself - if the robot’s going to die, it’s going to take the Doctor with it...\nREHABILITATION: PART THREE\nREHABILITATION: Baynes shuts off the robot, rescuing the Doctor. The Doctor accuses Davros of programming the robot to attack him - but the fault looks like it started in the Doctor's software.\nREHABILITATION: The Doctor is disciplined for going down to the production lines without seeking security clearance. Davros has no compunction about sacking the miners; the Doctor is appalled. Previously, Davros and the Doctor had been equals - now it’s clear that Baynes is playing favourites, and the Doctor has been reduced to little more than an assistant.\nREHABILITATION: Davros is suspicious of the Doctor - where is he getting his information? He tells Baynes to keep the Doctor under surveillance... and they quickly find the Doctor meeting Todd, who Baynes recognises as a troublemaker.\nREHABILITATION: Davros meets with Todd, who is still angry with him. Davros laughs at him - he’s never going to get anywhere without any weapons. Todd leaves vowing that he'li find some weapons, and Davros cackles.\nREHABILITATION: Davros enjoys his meetings with Mrs Baynes - he really is beginning to feel like he’s turned over a new leaf. But Mrs Baynes is the future equivalent of someone who collects Nazi regalia - she’s fascinated by his past. Davros is surprised that she wants him to be ruthless and evil. For his part, he wishes there was a way to get the economy of the galaxy onto a war footing. Mrs Baynes tells him that they could slowly play up the risk of alien invasion, bribe defence ministers to place more orders. Davros isn’t happy with this plan.\nREHABILITATION: Todd’s journalist friend, Craddock, transmats in from her spaceship, which she’s hidden in the wasteland outside the Dome. She hasn't broadcast the news - she wants to see it for herself, take pictures of TAI using Davros.They head towards the production lines via some tunnels.\nREHABILITATION: Baynes, who’s been monitoring them the whole time, confronts the Doctor and co in the tunnels underneath the dome. Craddock films the argument.\nREHABILITATION: 388\nREHABILITATION: Mrs Baynes is watching this with Davros. She’s just returned from the tunnels, she did what Davros said. Davros laughs - time to eliminate the competition. He waits until Todd repeats his boast about the rebels being organised and rising up - then detonates the explosive charges the Doctor planted.\nREHABILITATION: - and the Doctor, Baynes, Todd, Craddock and Peri watch as the rockface collapses, letting in a tidal wave of water...\nREHABILITATION: PART FOUR\nREHABILITATION: Mrs Baynes is hysterical. Davros tells her that he’s only doing what she was expecting him to. But she didn't rea/ly want her husband dead, Davros tells her they will have to move quickly.\nREHABILITATION: The news channels are reporting that Todd is a suicide bomber who's started a massive galaxy-wide uprising. This is exactly as Davros hoped. Now the colony worlds will move to crush the disgruntied workers - and TAI is ready to help them do just that. What better way to switch to a wartime economy than to start a war?\nREHABILITATION: In the flooded tunnels, it’s a life and death struggle. The Doctor and Baynes quickly get to safety. Baynes can't believe that Davros has double-crossed him, and the Doctor initially seems more interested in telling Baynes he told him so than stopping Davros. The Doctor wants to stay to save the others - Baynes convinces him the greater good would be served by stopping Davros.\nREHABILITATION: Davros has been working to take control of all of TAI’s computer systems. He now has a galaxy-wide infrastructure, with Mrs Baynes as his puppet leader. As predicted, every colony in this sector of the galaxy is in the throes of civil war. Mrs Baynes quickly broadcasts a hard line - she declares martial law on every planet TAI controls.\nREHABILITATION: Todd is dead, Peri and Craddock struggle to the surface, where they are arrested by\nTAI: guards.\nTAI: Davros is orchestrating a mass slaughter of surplus staff on the colony planets, under the guise of rounding up ‘subversives’.\nTAI: Baynes and the Doctor arrive, and smash the space radio, But Davros has lit the fuse - this fighting will spread across the galaxy. Davros repeats all the corporate speak: he's eliminating the competition, making the tough decisions.\nTAI: Peri and Craddock take advantage of the anarchy to retrieve the tape which implicates Davros. They broadcast it, knowing that as soon as Davros’ involvement is known, TAI will lose all sympathy and support from other planets.\nTAI: Baynes sabotages his own computer system, destroys Davros’s chain of command.\nTAI: Davros responds by unveiling a nuclear charge on a short countdown - the Doctor has to choose between stopping Davros from escaping in Craddock's ship or defusing the bomb.\nTAI: Davros makes his escape, and is in orbit when the Doctor transmats on board, with the nuclear bomb. He's not had time to defuse it, but he can give it back to its owner. The Doctor looks horrified - oh, no, the guidance mechanism on the teansmat is broken; he’s trapped here with Davros and they'll die together. Davros cackles with laughter ~ and the Doctor smiles: ‘Only joking - it is working, after all’ The Doctor transmats off the spacecraft, which is completely and utterly destroyed, with no hope of escape for\nTAI: Davros.\nTAI: Peri and the Doctor can see the remnants of the explosion as they head back to the TARDIS.A great evil has been removed from the universe...\nTAI: 389"
