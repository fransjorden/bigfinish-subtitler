I am your creator — and I can be your destroyer...\nMELANIE: Honestly, Doctor, stop being so melodramatic.\nDOCTOR: WHO Mel, am I not permitted an occasional moment of melodrama?\nMELANIE: Yes, but it’s only a game of Monopoly.\nDOCTOR: WHO A game that I am winning... yes, there is no power but mine... I control Park Lane, Mayfair, the waterworks...\nMELANIE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: WHO I want to imagine what it feels like to be a power crazed dictator. See into the enemy’s mind.\nMELANIE: And?\nDOCTOR: WHO Boring. And I hate hotels. Your roll.\nDOCTOR: MELANIE A double six,\nDOCTOR: WHO You're the iron, I’m the dog.\nMELANIE: Sorry.\nDOCTOR: WHO You're getting absent-minded. Most unlike you.\nMELANIE: (Groans) Oh no.\nDOCTOR: WHO Excellent. You must surrender to my will... two thousand, two hundred and sixty pounds rent, please.\nMELANIE: All right.*\nDOCTOR: WHO By the way, why did you reset the coordinates this morning?\nMELANIE: I thought you did.\nDOCTOR: WHO Yet more absent-mindedness...\nMELANIE: I haven’t been near the controls. Guide’s honour.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Amused) You were a Girl Guide?\nDOCTOR: bleeps.\nDOCTOR: Never mind that. These readings... the TARDIS is way off course...\nDOCTOR: WHO Way, way off course... we've drifted millennia into the far future..\nMELANIE: Who's done this? Who could control the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: WHO The same person who always does - or tries to. Me.\nMELANIE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: WHO I was experimenting with the navigation settings... and I must have accidentally switched on the wide-range distress transceiver. Knocked it with my elbow.’ The TARDIS responded automatically, like a dog fetching a bone. Yes, listen...\nMELANIE: Where's it coming from?\nMELANIE: 73\nDOCTOR: WHO I don’t know. But we’re almost on top of it. (Wearily) We'd better materialise, I suppose... ?\nMELANIE: Don’t worry, Doctor. We'll finish the game later. What's the matter?\nDOCTOR: WHO I just wish, sometimes, people could sort their problems out all by themselves. I mean, why does it always have to be me?\nDOCTOR: party is underway. Perhaps the sound of some hovering vehicle zooming past. This is the far future, after all. The TARDIS materialises with its customary wheezing and groaning. Nobody takes a blind bit of notice.\nMELANIE: So - where exactly are we?\nDOCTOR: WHO The vulgar end of time.\nMELANIE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: WHO I prefer never to go this far.\nMELANIE: Why?\nDOCTOR: WHO Everything’s been discovered. Everybody knows everybody else, and everybody knows everybody else’s business. All the wars are over — the interesting ones anyway. Technology’s made every pleasure affordable. Nobody strives... not that there’s anything worth striving for... it’s hedonism, hedonism, hedonism all the way... MELANIE And that’s a bad thing? How far ahead are we? After my time?\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh, 1989 is long gone. Although I suppose that's one reason for us to look on the bright side!\nMELANIE: Hmm. I might get a straight answer from the data bank...\nMELANIE: (CONT'D) According to this we’re on Generios 1°, central planet of the Great Generios System, in the constellation of... Generios. Hmm. ‘A mighty galactic trade Empire spanning seventeen planets’. And they need our help.\nDOCTOR: WHO Let’s have a look at the old scanner.\nDOCTOR: Silo scanner shutters slide open. We hear the sound of the crowd outside.\nMELANIE: Looks like a party.\nDOCTOR: WHO Appearances can be deceptive.\nMELANIE: Yes... perhaps they’ve been brainwashed into submission by invading aliens...\nDOCTOR: WHO (Gently chiding) Melodrama! Pass me my coat, will you?® (Shrugging it on)” Let’s divine the truth of the matter.\nDOCTOR: TARDIS. te .\nMELANIE: Don’t think much of this place.

We've only just arrived. We picked up a distress call.\nSOKKERY: Sorry... wasted journey. Here, you have a drop, pretty lady... anyone ever tell you you've got amazing ringlets?”\nMELANIE: Never mind my ringlets. What are you celebrating?\nSOKKERY: We've been saved... the Skelloids are vanquished...\"\nMELANIE: Skelloids?\nDOCTOR: WHO Skelloids?\nSOKKERY: (With relish) Ferocious aliens from the outer reaches of deep space... like living skeletons. There were hundreds of them, vicious and deadly, ready to land their mother ship on this, our Great City of Generios. They would have enslaved us.\nMELANIE: But you defeated them?\nSOKKERY: Oh no. We were useless. The Great Council tried to make peace with the Skelloids and failed. And our defences were totally inadequate.\nDOCTOR: WHO So - what became of these ‘Skelloids’?'’ Did they just pack up and go home for tea?\nSOKKERY: Course not - the Skelloids never give up. The Doctor sorted them out for us, didn’t he?\nSOKKERY: A big incidental music moment.\nDOCTOR: WHO The Doctor... did you say the Doctor?\nSOKKERY: Yeah... you know, the mysterious Time Lord. Travels the universe poking his nose in, putting things to rights. You must know the legends.\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes, I believe I have heard something...\nSOKKERY: I thought it was a lot of billy rot until he actually turned up and saved the day. With his assistant — phwoarr, lovely girl. Anyway, I've spent long enough talking to you two - there’s a conga over there with my name on it!\nDOCTOR: WHO I said they were vulgar.\nMELANIE: It looks like you've already saved the day, then. Beaten yourself to it.\nDOCTOR: WHO Somehow I doubt it.’* I've never been to Generios before.\nMELANIE: Then you will in the future.\nDOCTOR: WHO I doubt that too.\nMELANIE: Why?\nDOCTOR: WHO I can sense the proximity of another self, having experienced it on several occasions.'® My hair stands on end.\nDOCTOR: 75\nMELANIE: (Laughing) How could it? : ; ;\nDOCTOR: WHO (Deadly serious) Figuratively speaking. And this time it hasn't.\nMELANIE: You're really rattled, aren’t you? i\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes. Because if I didn't save this planet from the evil Skelioids - who is the Doctor that did...?\nDOCTOR: 5, INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY\nDOCTOR: A big, draughiy, vaulted room. The celebrating crowd can be heard - close, but muffled. Enter POTIKOL, the rather fey and nervous head councilor.\nPOTIKOL: Listen to the citizens! This day is truly unique in the Great Annals of Generios! The people rejoice!\nPOTIKOL: THE DOCTOR!’\nPOTIKOL: (CONT’D) They’re crying out for their saviour! Are you sure you won't step out on to the balcony, Doctor?\nPOTIKOL: Ah, but this isn't really the Doctor. Here we meet BANTO ZAME and SALLY-ANNE, confidence tricksters. Both are currently doing fair, if rather over-the-top impressions of Doctor Who and his assistant. BANTO is being terribly bombastic and grandiose while SALLY-ANNE is the very model of simpering naivete. These, as we shall see, are not their natural states,\nBANTO: ZAME I’m sorry, Councillor Potikol, but I hate farewells.\nPOTIKOL: But you've done so much for us — saved the seventeen planets from certain annihilation...\nBANTO: ZAME Please - any passing genius would have done the same.\nPOTIKOL: (Laughs obsequiously) Tell me again — how did you defeat the Skelloids?\nBANTO: ZAME It was simple enough - after I worked out their entire life cycle was based on the absorption of hydrogen through their gill-plates.\nPOTIKOL: Go on.\nBANTO: ZAME I simply inverted the core of their hydrogen stabilisers. With a little help from my psychic screwdriver ~ and a little help from Sally Anne.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE I wondered when you'd get round to mentioning me.\nPOTIKOL: Generios is indebted to your assistant as well, Doctor. SALLY-ANNE So the core sucked hydrogen from the Skelloids instead of supplying it to them.\nBANTOZAME: Result - skedaddle, Skelloids! They won’t be back again — well, at least, not for another couple of aeons. Anyway, Potikoi, time’s winged chariot marches on - especially for a Time Lord. Sally-Anne and I really must get back to the TARDIST (sic).'”\nPOTIKOL: Must you leave us, Doctor?\nBANTO: ZAME I'm afraid so.\nPOTIKOL: How can we ever repay you for saving us?\nPOTIKOL: pea) Ae I don’t expect repayment — the work I do is reward in itself.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE (As if struck by an idea) Hey Doctor - what about the pluvon power crystals?\nPOTIKOL: 76\nBANTO: ZAME Eh? Oh yes...\nPOTIKOL: Pluvon power crystals? SALLY-ANNE We need them for the TARDIST. And we’re running dry.\nPOTIKOL: I'm afraid we have no such crystals. The seventeen\nPOTIKOL: planets were mined out generations ago.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Yes -— but you’ve got the cash we could use to buy them.\nBANTO: ZAME Come on, Sally-Anne, that’s out of the question. Goodbye, Councillor —\nPOTIKOL: One moment, Doctor. How much do you need to buy these crystals you seek?\nBANTO: ZAME Really, I won't hear of it —\nPOTIKOL: Doctor. SALLY-ANNE About a hundred million credits.\nPOTIKOL: (Shocked) A hundred million...\nBANTO: ZAME Yes, quite. It’s our problem, not yours. So we'll just slip quietly away...\nPOTIKOL: No. I won't hear of it. If a hundred million is what you need, Doctor, Sally-Anne - a hundred million is what you shall have.\nBANTO: ZAME No, Potikol, I absolutely insist — I will not take your money.\nPOTIKOL: Please, Doctor. What is a hundred million credits weighed against the lives of all in the seventeen planets?\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Go on, Doctor.\nBANTO: ZAME I do have principles, you know...\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE You won't have much use for them if we don’t get those power crystals.\nBANTO: ZAME You have a point... Very well, Councillor.\nPOTIKOL: You will accept our gift.\nBANTO: ZAME As a loan. I will find some way to repay you.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, Doctor, what more could you have done for us?\nPOTIKOL: I will go at once to the Great Bank of Generios and make out a cheque.”\nBANTO: ZAME Ev... I'd prefer cash. I don’t actually have a bank account myself. Never had much use for money.\nPOTIKOL: I understand. It shall be done. Wait here.\nBANTO: ZAME and SALLY-ANNE burst into laughter and revert to their real personas. SALLY-ANNE is as common as muck, while BANTO is cynical, brusque and ever-so-slightly camp.\nBANTO: ZAME Ha ha... there's one born every nanosecond... SALLY-ANNE Banto, this lot have gotta be the doziest load of prawns\nBANTO: yet.\nBANTO: ZAME ‘Please, Doctor. What is a hundred million credits weighed against the lives of all in the seventeen planets?’ What a plank! SALLY-ANNE ‘Time marches on ~ especially for a Time Lord’ Loved it Pass me one of them beers.\nBANTO: ZAMB To us - and to our ‘pluvon power crystals’. SALLY-ANNE (Mock appalled) Oh Doctor - you’re not going to spend that money on something else, are you?\nBANTO: ZAME Come here and give us a kiss.\nBANTO: PX - BANTO ZAME and SALLY-ANNE kiss.\nBANTO: ane\nBANTO: We're outside the council complex now — much FX cheering, clapping and good-natured hammering on the door.\nDOCTOR: WHO This must be it — their Great Council Complex. Everything around here seems to be Great.'”\nMELANIE: Great! So how are we going to get inside? Knock on the door?\nDOCTOR: WHO Everybody’s knocking on the door.\nMELANIE: Somebody’s popular. (She sees SOKKERY) Oh no...”\nDOCTOR: WHO What?\nMELANIE: It’s him again.\nSOKKERY: Hello.*! Come to see the Doctor, have you? They reckon he’s gonna step out on to the balcony up there.\nDOCTOR: WHO Is that some sort of newspaper you’ve got there?\nSOKKERY: Eh? Oh yeah, Great Visi-Mcho of Generios. Special commemorative edition.\nMELANIE: That must be him — plastered all over the front page...\nSOKKERY: Yeah, that’s the Doctor.”\nDOCTOR: WHO Give me that...\nSOKKERY: Here, steady on, there’s a voucher for the Great Commemorative Tea-towel in there...\nDOCTOR: WHO Look at that Mel! It is definitely not me!\nMELANIE: How can you be so sure?\nDOCTOR: WHO I have assumed several guises over the centuries but have always maintained an essential air of Olympian dignity. Look at this buffoon!\nMELANIE: He looks all right to me.\nDOCTOR: WHO All right? Ali right? FPlorid complexion, nose like a mulberry... and his figure is positively rotund!\nMELANIE: You’re not exactly sylphlike.\nDOCTOR: WHO There is a difference between being big-boned and being portly! There’s no doubt about it ~ I must confront this impostor. Impersonating a Time Lord is a serious offence. I may need this paper as evidence.\nSOKKERY: Hey!\nMELANIE: How are we going to get in?\nSOKKERY: (Sulky now) You can’t. Without a pass.”\nDOCTOR: WHO I can go anywhere I like. (Cunning, slow) Mel... how’s your wilting willow impersonation?\nDOCTOR: Big, end-of scene twinkling music. A beat.**\nMELANIE: What? What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: WHO I mean - I’ve got a plan.\nMELANIE: Why didn’t you just say so?\nDOCTOR: WHO Ev... yes. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: We're back with BANTO ZAME and SALLY-ANNE, still smooching.\nDOCTOR: 78\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE ’Ere, get off, Banto. Someone might come through that door any second. Won’t suit our image to be all crumpled and rumpled.\nBANTO: ZAME I wonder where he is with that cash? It’s been twenty minutes.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE What, you don't reckon he might’ve rumbled us?”\nBANTO: ZAME Fotikol? He’s a fool. Remember when the ‘Skelloid Commander’ told him to (alien voice) ‘surrender or die’?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Yeah, hur hur... 1 thought he were gonna have an accident.\nBANTO: ZAME That’s him - get up. Quick sticks! And hide those cans!\nBANTO: corner as the door opens and POTIKOL enters. BANTO and SALLY-ANNE revert to their Doctor Who personas.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, Doctor...\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Oh Councilor, did you manage to get the money?\nBANTO: ZAME I still feel extremely dubious about this arrangement, Sally-Anne.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Ignore him, Councillor — too proud, that’s his trouble.\nPOTIKOL: I'm afraid there’s been a slight problem. SALLY-ANNE You what? I mean - a problem, you say? POTIKOL The computer links to the Great Bank of Generios are\nPOTIKOL: being... influenced somehow.\nBANTO: ZAME Influenced?\nPOTIKOL: ‘Yes. In fact, all the workings of the Great Computers of Generios are slipping somewhat out of our control.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE What - your cash machine’s on the blink?”\nPOTIKOL: If only it were that simple.\nBANTO: ZAME Potikol, please get to the point. POTIKOL At first we thought the interference was perhaps an after-\nBANTO: effect of the Skelloids’ handiwork.\nBANTO: ZAME I doubt it. ] mean - unlikely.\nPOTIKOL: But our Great Radarscopes have just reported a foreign object — a piece of space debris - that has drifted into the System.\nBANTO: ZAME And it’s interfering with your computers somehow?\nPOTIKOL: We think so. But do not fret, Doctor. I have dispatched a space dredger to blast it out of the skies.” All will be well. Excuse me while I attend to the arrangements...\nPOTIKOL: type.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE {I told you. They’ve cottoned on. We ought to get out of here.\nBANTO: ZAME And lose our chance of a hundred million credits? SALLY-ANNE You don’t believe all his fluff about flotsam?\nBANTO: ZAME Why ever not? There are still huge chunks of debris floating round from the Skardu/Rosbrix wars.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Floating out this far?\nBANTO: ZAME Just relax, my little coelacanth. Here have another can. Listen, if they had the slightest doubt about us, we’d be clapped in irons by now.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE (Taking a sip) Ooh... doesn’t sound too uncomfortable, if I was with you.\nBANTO: 79\nBANTO: ZAME And I with you, my turtle dove.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Ooh, be romantic.\nBANTO: ZAME Later. When I’ve got that hundred million in my hand I'll be very romantic.\nBANTO: inside the Council Complex. FX doors open. We hear the crowd.\nGUARD: This way, sir...\nMELANIE: inside. She groans, feebly.\nDOCTOR: WHO I'm sorry, she’s usually a very picture of health.\nMELANIE: (Woozy) Oh... where am I? I feel...\nDOCTOR: WHO Now now, Mel, you've just fainted in the crush, that’s all.\nGUARD: Just lay her down here, sir, against the wall.”\nDOCTOR: WHO There you go.\nMELANIE: It must have been the excitement of being that close to the Doctor...\nDOCTOR: WHO (Arch) Indeed.\nMELANIE: I could do with a glass of water — clear my head.”\nDOCTOR: WHO If it’s not too much trouble. We'll just wait here. Innocently.\nGUARD: Right you are, sir. 1 won't be a second — there’s a cooler round the corner.\nDOCTOR: WHO Right. Let’s slip off.\nMELANIE: Which way? These corridors all look the same.\nDOCTOR: WHO Not to a corridor veteran like me. This way — I’m rather excited about meeting the Doctor myself.\nDOCTOR: The GUARD is filling a glass of water from the cooler and humming softly to himself. FX - water pouring into cup. We hear POTIKOL approaching in a great flurry from a distance.\nPOTIKOL: Guard! Guard! Summon the council!\nGUARD: Councillor! Whatever's the matter?\nGUARD: POTIKOL A great calamity - another great calamity — has befallen us! Inform the council that our dredger has been destroyed.”\nGUARD: Not the Skelloids?\nPOTIKOL: No, not the Skelloids. Well don’t just stand there man, get\nPOTIKOL: off and summon the council. And give me that glass of water.\nGUARD: Yes sir. On my way sir. The GUARD hurries off.\nPOTIKOL: Oh, what a day... what a day...\nDOCTOR: WHO and MELANIE have arrived outside the chamber. They are whispering.\nDOCTOR: 80\nDOCTOR: WHO This must be the place.\nMELANIE: How can you be sure?\nDOCTOR: WHO That sign on the door - ‘Great Council Chamber of Generios’.\nMELANIE: Well you were standing in front of it!\nDOCTOR: WHO I imagine this is where we’ll find their guest of honour.\nDOCTOR: 11, INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY\nBANTO: ZAME and SALLY-ANNE are now rather merry.\nBANTO: ZAME ...we could buy ourselves a nice slab of real estate out on the rim worlds...\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE The rim worlds?\nBANTO: ZAME Yes, what about buying up Abidos?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Abidos? There’s nowt there.’\nBANTO: ZAME There will be. We’ll build a pleasure complex... SALLY-ANNE Ooohh...\nBANTO: ZAME To satisfy our every desire... We'll be outside the law. No amusement too extreme... no diversion too decadent...\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE We could have bingo and ice-rinks.\nBANTO: ZAME I was thinking more of a total sensory immersion device, like they have on Zynglat 3.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Oooh... I like the sound of total sensory emulsion...\nBANTO: ZAME Immersion...\nBANTO: ZAME (CONT’D) What the...? Here —- who are you?\nDOCTOR: WHO I think it is who should be directing that question to you.\nBANTO: ZAME I, sir, am the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO The Doctor, eh?\nMELANIE: You're not the Doctor, this is the Doctor!\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE ’Ere, what’s going on?\nBANTO: ZAME Oh, [ understand. Yes, it’s all becoming very clear. You are the Doctor then?\nDOCTOR: WHO Indeed! I am the one and only - and there’s nobody I'd rather be!\nMELANIE: Exactly. You’re a fraud — so obviously bogus!\nSALI: Y-ANNE Eh?\nBANTO: ZAME Don’t you see, Sal? You can't have an original idea nowadays. Now listen you - this is my patch, and I invented this operation, so hop off.\nDOCTOR: WHO I'm not hopping anywhere. I am the Doctor!\nBANTO: ZAME Yeah, yeah, I’m the Doctor, you're the Doctor, we're all the flipping Doctor. But this is my system, I’ve been working West Galaxy a long time, twenty-five years in this business.**\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE So you'll do an about-turn if you fancy keeping your elbows intact.\nMELANIE: I must really be missing something here. Who are these jokers?\nDOCTOR: WHO An immaculate deception, Mel. Allow me to ‘double’ check...\nBANTO: ZAME Here, get your hands off my chest!**\nBANTO: 81\nDOCTOR: WHO There we are. A single heartbeat — if he’s a Time Lord then I am Marie of Romania.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE You'd better not try that on me.\nMELANIE: I'm still lagging behind here.\nDOCTOR: WHO It all seems quite clear to me, Mel. They turn up ata planet, fake an alien invasion somehow — 3\nMELANIE: I get it — they sweep in, foil the invasion and claim the credit.\nDOCTOR: WHO Playing off my not inconsiderable renown. Well, it’s got to stop!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Too right it has.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, Doctor, you must... what is going on? SALLY-ANNE (Simpering) Oh Councillor, you’ve simply got to help us. These people are intruders.\nBANTO: ZAME They're overexcited fans.\nDOCTOR: WHO Fans? Fans?\nBANTO: ZAME I get them all the time. ‘Doctor, what was it like on the planet Zenta? Doctor, what were you thinking when you defeated the Deadly Dustbins?’ et cetera, et cetera.\nPOTIKOL: I see. Guards?” Take these two away.\nGUARD: Sir?\nPOTIKOL: Yes, take these two intruders away.\nGUARD: Sir.”\nMELANIE: Hey! Get your hands off me!\nDOCTOR: WHO This is an outrage! I am the Doctor! I am the Doctor!** They are carted away and the door shuts. DOCTOR WHO rants ad lib as he is led away.\nBANTO: ZAME Please be gentle with them. It’s really very sad. SALLY-ANNE Did you sort out the problem at the Great Bank, Councillor?\nPOTIKOL: If only I had. Doctor, Sally-Anne, we are in terrible danger.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Not the Skelloids?\nPOTIKOL: No, not the Skelloids. That object has destroyed our\nPOTIKOL: dredger — and it's heading straight for us!*\nPOTIKOL: A bit of an awkward silence.\nPOTIKOL: (CONT'D) Doctor - er, did you hear what I said?\nPANT: TAM (Laughs) Yes, yes, very good, Potikol, I get it. Very ‘unny.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, this is in deadly earnest. I wouldn't joke with you. SALLY-ANNE You mean - there really is a UFO heading here?\nPOTIKOL: Yes. Thank goodness you're still here with us, Doctor.\nPOTIKOL: Only you can save us now!\nBANTO: ZAME (Gulping, very uncertain) Quite. Oh...\nBANTO: bars, slide a bolt, i.e. lock them in. Dank, echoing atmos here.”\nBANTO: 82\nGUARD: (Stern) You stay there until the Councillor decides what to do with you.”\nMELANIE: This is a travesty of justice. You can’t treat us like this, we're the innocent parties. We have rights you know! Don’t we even get any food?\nGUARD: (Friendly) Yeah, course. There’s a machine in that corner. Next to the sofa.\nMELANIE: Oh yes, sorry.\nGUARD: We've got business to attend to.\"\nMELANIE: Doctor, don’t look so downhearted. It’s not as if those two are actually doing any harm.\nDOCTOR: WHO It's not you whose reputation is being actively besmirched.\nMELANIE: It’s quite a clever scam, really. I almost admire their pluck. How do they know who you and the Time Lords are anyway? You don't normally like to advertise your presence.\nDOCTOR: WHO This is the vulgar end of time, remember, Mel. Everything’s been said, done, bought and sold. Cheapened. (Sighs) I’ve become a legend. A laughable footnote in the history of the universe. People doubt I ever existed. Like Father Christmas.\nMELANIE: Perhaps people here leave mince pies out for you. Oh come on, Doctor, that was worth a smile,\nDOCTOR: WHO I had hoped for a rather more fitting remembrance. Nowadays it seems any Tom, Dick or Cephalapod can go round claiming to be me, trading on my reputation.\nMELANIE: Well let’s keep that reputation intact by getting out of this place.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Pulling himself together) Yes, you're right...’\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT'D) Hmm, a simple trisonic lock. Should be easy... for a ‘legend’ like me.\nDOCTOR: He and MEL laugh. FX — A wave of feedback-type noise starts to fade up eradually.\nMELANIE: What's that? An alarm?\nDOCTOR: WHO I don’t think so... It sounds like... like a multiphasing corpolectric soundwave! Very nasty! Who could be...?\nMELANIE: It’s getting louder!\nDOCTOR: WHO Concentrate, Mel.? Try and blot it out! It’s our... only chance... to...\nDOCTOR: The noise is louder here. The crowd are now crying out in terror. The sound of a huge engine getting closer. Wind whips around.

SALLY-ANNE It’s massive! Doctor, do something!\nPOTIKOL: Help us, Doctor!\nBANTO: ZAME (Yelling) I can’t! I can’t!\nBANTO: MEL and DOCTOR WHO are still struggling against the din. Their voices slur as the soundwave invades their heads.\nMELANIE: Aaargh... Doctor... I can’t... can’t bear it! What... is... it?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Struggling, his voice reaching a crescendo of pain and fear) ...a weapon... must fight... concentrate... aargh... it’s... destroying... our minds!!\nMELANIE: Doe - tor...\nDOCTOR: WHO Concen.rate, Mel... we must... clear...\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT'D) - our heads...\nDOCTOR: He realises the noise has stopped.\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT'D) Peculiar... Are you all right?\nMELANIE: It’s stopped. I... I'm fine, I think. Just dizzy. Who would want to do that? e\nDOCTOR: WHO I really don’t know. I thought for a moment that -*\nCYLINDER: VOICE (In, huge, booming) I trust I have your attention. CN.B. We can tell the voice is booming out over the entire planet.)\nMELANIE: Who is that?\nDOCTOR: WHO Whoever made the noise I’d imagine. Ssh, listen...\nCYLINDER: VOICE Citizens of Generios, you will listen.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, what is it?\nBANTO: ZAME (Authoritative) A mysterious voice. SALLY-ANNE From that thing in the sky?\nBANTO: ZAME I think it likely.\nCYLINDER: VOICE I wish to speak to your leader.\nPOTIKOL: Oh. Er... that is I.\nCYLINDER: VOICE Speak up. My sensors are homing in on your location.\nPOTIKOL: (Louder) It is T. Sir.\nCYLINDER: VOICE You are the one they call Potikol?\nPOTIKOL: Yes. What can we of Generios do for you?\nCYLINDER: VOICE I[ have been sent to collect Tribute.\nCYLINDER: A beat. The echoes of ‘Tribute’ die away.\nCYLINDER: 85\nPOTIKOL: Um. What kind of tribute?\nCYLINDER: VOICE (Angry) You know what kind!\nPOTIKOL: Er, really sir, I don’t. Perhaps you could -\nPOTIKOL: C¥LINDER VOICE My purpose is to collect Tribute. I must have the three greatest treasures of the Generios System. Or I will destroy you all!\nDOCTOR: WHO and MEL have been listening attentively. The CYLINDER\nVOICE: goes on as they talk.\nCYLINDER: VOICE (B/G) These must be presented to me in good repair. You will bring them to me and I will analyse them in order to assess their value. Failure to do so will result in immediate death for your peoples.”\nDOCTOR: WHO Incredible. It must be transmitting to the entire planet.\nMELANIE: It sounds rather unforgiving.\nDOCTOR: WHO We must get out of here.\nMELANIE: But how?\nDOCTOR: WHO That electronic food dispenser... it might take a bit of work, but that could be our means of escape...\nDOCTOR: 18, INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY\nCYLINDER: VOICE (NB: recorded in this scene but used in Se 17) These must be presented to me in good repair. You will bring them to me and I will analyse them in order to assess their value. Failure to do so will result in immediate death for your peoples.*”\nPOTIKOL: Sir, it will take some time for us to assemble the items you require. There are seventeen planets in our Great Union —\nGYLINDER: VOICE You have five marlegs to comply.\nPOTIKOL: Five marlegs?\nCYLINDER: VOICE Yes. It is more than enough time.\nPOTIKOL: Pardon me, but how long is a marleg exactly?\nCYLINDER: VOICE It is exactly fifteen and a half gluarbs long of course.” SALLY-ANNE And how long’s a gluarb?\nCYLINDER: VOICE (Heavy sigh, pause) Five marlegs is equivalent to three of your hours. I shall speak again then. Beware - if you fail to bring the Tribute, my response will be swift and merciless.\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, do you think it can do what it claims?\nBANTO: ZAME I’m very much afraid it can, Councillor. And in the time it’s given us, we don’t have any option but to collect what it wants. SALLY-ANNE So what are we going to do, Doctor?\nBANTO: ZAME Obviously, we shall need the TARDIST. Councillor, could you arrange for it to be brought here, very urgently? I must set off at once.\nBANTO: POTIKOL Of course. And I shall compile a list of the three greatest treasures of Generios and their locations.\nBANTO: ZAME What? Oh yes — of course.\nPOTIKOL: Oh thank you, Doctor. What bad luck. Two alien threats in as many days. But what good luck to have you here to deal with them. I shall go and order the TARDIST to be brought here at once.\nPOTIKOL: 86\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Well done. Now we can get out of here before that big hairy UFO blots this lot.\nBANTO: ZAME What big hairy UFO?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE The one that just blasted our earholes, you git. The one in the sky!\nBANTO: ZAMB Think about it. ‘Bring me the three greatest treasures’ this mysterious voice says.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Yeah?\nBANTO: ZAME Don't you see? It’s another version of our operation! SALLY-ANNE (Figuring it out) What — you mean that curly-haired piece that was just in here...\nBANTO: ZAME It’s his version of the Skelloids. Pay up or I'll destroy you. So he goes and gets the treasure, no questions asked, and he’s off before you can say Theory of Parallel Matter.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE The rotten swine. Conning these people.\nBANTO: ZAME Yes. At least I give them a sense of being saved, and they’re none the wiser. He scarpers and leaves them feeling like a right bunch of Quarks. No style.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE So that thing in the sky...?\nBANTO: ZAME Projection I expect. Like the Skelloid mothership. No originality.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE That voice was right convincing though. Gave me goose pimples.\nBANTO: ZAME Yeah, granted, but you don’t get the same effect with audio. People want to actually see the monsters. Remember when that Skelloid materialised in front of the Council?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANWE Classy, yeah. Here, we can't leave, then — not without our hundred million, let Curlytop and Ginge walk off with the loot.\nBANTO: ZAME Did you think I would? Nobody pushes me off my patch. Pm going to see he gets what’s coming.\nBANTO: batter the door down.\nMELANIE: (Out of puff) When you said you were... going to use the... dispenser to get the door open... I didn’t think you meant like this...\nDOCTOR: WHO One more heave... (FX — The door gives way.) There we are. Careful with it... (FX - They put the food machine down.) Ahh. When science stumbles, force has a certain finesse. Now — we must discover more about that voice. Come on.\nMELANIE: Hold on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes?\nMELANIE: Two things. One - aren't the guards going to come rushing down here after all that racket?\nDOCTOR: WHO Mel, the people here think they’ve only got five marlegs ~ sorry, three hours - left to live. Keeping anybody locked up will be the Jast thing on their minds. Two?*!\nMELANIE: That voice sounded fishy to me.\nDOCTGR: WHO What, of aquatic origin, you think?\nMELANIE: No, Doctor, Couldn't it be part of those impostors’ scam?\nDOCTOR: WHO Skelloids are one thing. But the technology needed to\nDOCTOR: 87\nDOCTOR: transmit a corpolectric soundwave doesn't come cheap, even in this period. Unlikely to be within the reach of our friends up there. Satisfied\nMEL: ANTE Why do you always have the answer to everything?\nDOCTOR: WHO One of the advantages of being very old. Come on, the Counci) Chamber.”\nDOCTOR: POTIKOL and the GUARDS are carrying the fake TARDIS through the corridors up to the council chamber. FX - Much shuffling of feet, grunting and the occasional thud as the fake TARDIS hits a doorway.\nPOTIKOL: Careful, you men... the Doctor’s TARDIST must not be damaged... hurry... time is running out... (ad Ifb similar in B/G as they move away)\nDOCTOR: WHO and MEL see this happening and whisper, close mic.\nMELANIE: What’s that they’ve got?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Seething) I can think of a number of terms for it, but for now let’s just call it an insult. That is supposed to be the TARDIS.\nMELANIE: But it’s nothing like it. Looks more like a... well, a... Oh dear. I suppose some details always get garbled in legends.\nDOCTOR: WHO Don’t try and placate me. Let’s follow them.\nDOCTOR: 21, INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY BANTO and SALLY-ANNE are waiting for the TARDIST.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE I wish they’d hurry up with that thing. Don’t see why we have to lug the teleporter round in that dirty great box.\nBANTO: ZAME All part of the illusion, my duck. Anyway, when it arrives we'll get inside and go and find our two competitors.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Can I bash the girl?\nBANTO: ZAME Why?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE I saw you eyeing her up.\nBANTO: ZAME I did not! You imagined it.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE You were eating her up with those piggy little peepers of yours. Besides, she was really overdoing it with that ‘Oh Doctor’ business. I mean, when I do it, I’m subtle.\nBANTO: ZAME Very. Oh, here they come...\nPOTIKOL: Through here... mind the door... quickly...\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE 0h Doctor, it’s good to see the TARDIST again. (Sotto) See, I'm subtle, ain’t I?\nBANTO: ZAME Right. Well, Potikol, we'd better get started...\nPOTIKOL: You'll need this list of our three greatest treasures and where to find them.\nBANTO: ZAME Ch yes.\nPOTIKOL: Beware, Doctor. Although our world is civilised, not all the planets in the system are so welcoming. You must take great care.\nBANTO: ZAME I always do, Potikol. Right, Sally-Anne, into the TARDIST...\nBANTO: 88\nDOCTOR: WHO Not so fast! Councillor, that man cannot protect you from your enemy because he is not the Doctor!”\nPOTIKOL: Oh goodness — not these idiots again! Guards, throw them out — onto the streets this time! I must go to the people and try to calm them! Good luck, Doctor — the future of Generios is in your hands, again!™*\nGUARD: Right then you...\nBANTO: ZAME It’s all right, guards, I’ll deal with these two. Go.\nGUARD: Oh. Right you are then, sir. We'll wait outside.*\nBANTO: ZAME You've got some cheek. Very clever, the big voice, but it never fooled me.\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh, did someone say something?®® Oh yes, it must have been that impostor over there! Now you listen to me, I presume that contraption —\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE The TARDIST.\nDOCTOR: WHO The what? No, I heard you the first time. It’s capable of short range teleport, yes? ;\nBANTO: ZAME What business is it of yours?”\nDOCTOR: WHO Any time I see innocent people being exploited I make it my business. And this time, it's personal. I suppose you thought disguising your so-called ‘TARDIST’ in that ridiculous manner was funny, eh?\nBANTO: ZAME Funny? There's nothing funny about that. It's accurate to the last detail\nDOCTOR: WHO Accurate? Hah! If you were even a semi-competent con- mnan, you'd realise that the TARDIS - my TARDIS - has been in the shape of a Police Box for centuries.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Tch! Everybody knows that!®® We done our research. That is a Police Box. 12\nMELANIE: No it isn’t. That’s a... well, a... (sighs) a portaloo.® SALLY-ANNE Eh?\nBANTO: ZAME Listen, you. We’ve seen the holo-records. You can’t catch us out. Policemen were always hanging around these things.\nDOCTOR: WHO You really are an imbecile, aren’t you?\nBANTO: ZAME Listen, do I have to get nasty?\nDOCTOR: WHO I wouldn't advise it. I’m quite capable of defending myself.\nBANTO: ZAME (Louder) Oh yes?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Louder) Yes!\nMELANIE: CYelling) Quiet! (Normal voice) Thank you. Listen, time’s running out and all you two can do is indulge in a slanging match. That creature out there could kill us all!\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Come Off it, love, we know that’s part of you muscling in on our territory.\nMELANIE: What? We've got nothing to do with that! It’s a deadly threat to us all!\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Gawd! Look, there’s no one here but us now, so you can drop the goody twoshoes act.\nMELANIE: What act?\nCYLINDER: VOICE Generios! I would remind you all there are now only four point six-three marlegs left to complete the task.\nCYLINDER: 89\nBANTO: ZAME Listen to that — so unconvincing.\nCYLINDER: VOICE If any should doubt the seriousness, of my intention, I shall now destroy the eleventh planet of this system! E\nCYLINDER: starts to panic and exclaim.\nCYLINDER: VOICE (CONT’D) Now fetch Tribute. Or the same fate will befalk you.\nBANTO: ZAME (A liitle unsure) This is pathetic.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Yeah, as if anyone’s gonna believe that.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE (CONT'D) Flippin ’Ada!\nMELANIE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: WHO Get down!\nBANTO: ZAME What was that?\nCYLINDER: VOICE A further demonstration of my power!\nCYLINDER: SALLY-ANNE It went right past my nose!\nCYLINDER: VOICE I demand Tribute! Do you need any more convincing? SALLY-ANNE What was it?\nCYLINDER: MELANIE A high energy impulse beam?\nDOCTOR: WHO Top of the form, Mel. Directed straight at us. The creature must realise we're the only ones capable of doing its bidding. SALLY-ANNE Banto - this is actually for real then?\nBANTO: ZAME For the first time, I’ve got the horrible feeling it might be. SALLY-ANNE A bona fido alien invasion.\nMELANIE: ‘Yes. How does it feel now the boot’s on the other foot?\nDOCTORWHO: No time for recriminations, Mel. (To BANTO) Unfortunately! We must get back to the TARDIS.\nBANTO: ZAME (Sotto) They are mad.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE So what are we gonna do?\nBANTO: ZAME Get the first shuttle out of here, that’s what. SALLY-ANNE Everyone’s gonna be trying that!\nBANTO: ZAME We'll bribe one of the pilots.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE What with?\nBANTO: ZAME You, if all else fails. Now quick — into the teleporter. Goodbye, you fruitcakes.\nDOCTOR: WHO Wait! I think you can give us a, lift.\nDOCTOR: MELANIE In that thing?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Pointediy) Whatever it might look like, it’s merely a disguised short-range teleporter.\nBANTO: ZAME Listen —\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Banto, come on!\nBANTO: ZAME One second, Sally-Anne. (To DOCTOR WHO) I don’t know who you think you are, and I don’t care. But I would rather pluck out my own eyes with a pair of rusty forceps than ever see you again. SALLY-ANNE Come on, Banto!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Whispers) Right, Mel — you take him, Ill take her!\nMELANIE: Okay!\nDOCTOR: WHO Now!\nDOCTOR: manhandle BANTO and SALLY-ANNE into the fake TARDIS.\nBANTO: ZAME Oof! Get her off me!\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE ‘Ere, leggo!\nBANTO: 90\nDOCTOR: WHO This is what I believe is known as hitching a ride! Get them inside, Mel!\nPOTIKOL: Doctor, Doctor - please, you must hurry — the eleventh planet has been destroyed — (surprised) oh. They've gone inside.**\nPOTIKOL: the TARDIS we know and love and a flushing loo.\nPOTIKOL: (CONT'D) Good luck, Doctor.\nPOTIKOL: breathlessness and rustling of clothing as they move.\nMELANIE: Ow! This TARDIS feels smaler inside than outside.\nBANTO: ZAME You two’ve gone too far this time —\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Yeah, you can't push your way in here!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Brightly) We just did. Ah, as I thought. This device could barely get us to the front gate, as it were.\nMELANIE: This must be the co-ordinate entry panel.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE It is, yeah, so get your mitts off it.\nBANTO: ZAME Set the controls for the space docks, Sal.\nDOCTOR: WHO I don’t think you’re going to find your getaway quite so easy as usual.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE ‘Ere, Banto — the panel’s stuck.\nBANTO: ZAME You knew that was going to happen.\nBANTO: MELANIE The Doctor's a past master at knowing what's about to happen.\nDOCTOR: WHO Do you think that object up there, whatever it is, will let anyone escape? Its powers are phenomenal. Fortunately, there is one journey I think it will be happy to make. May I?\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Banto? Shall I let him?\nBANTO: ZAME Might as well.\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes... I thought so...\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT’D) There we go. Theory proved.\nMELANIE: I take it we’re heading straight into the jaws of deadly danger?\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh no. Not directly, anyway...\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE (Sotto) They're mentalists.\nBANTO: ZAME (Sotto) When we land... get ready to cosh them...”\nMEL: step out.\nMELANIE: (With reservation) Well — I’m pleased to see the TARDIS — the real TARDIS — again...\nBOCTOR: WHO But?\nMELANIE: But what?\nMELANIE: oO\nDOCTOR: WHO Miss Bush, I detect a certain reservation.\nMELANIE: That thing allowed us to come here, didn’t it? It’s using us like puppets on a string.\nDOCTOR: WHO I'm afraid so.\nDOCTOR: BANTO and SALLY-ANNE emerge.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Here, where’s this? This ain't Generios!\nDOCTOR: WHO This, my dear, is the TARDIS. The real thing. SALLY-ANNE It’s weird... Gives me a warm feeling. Banto?\nBANTO: ZAME (Slowly) Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE (Sotto) Shall I cosh ’em then?\nBANTO: ZAME Oh dear. Oh dear.”\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Whassup?\nMELANIE: I think your friend is beginning to realise we've been telling the truth.\nBANTO: ZAME This technology... I’ve never seen anything like it...\nMELANIE: Time Lord technology.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE You're not saying - they are the full ticket? But that means...\nMELANIE: Exactly. He is the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO So, given that we’ve finally sorted out that little case of mistaken identity and established you as an impostor, a fraudster and a not-so-petty criminal, perhaps you could furnish us with a name to accompany that glowing CV, hmm?\nBANTO: ZAME (Dazed) Uh, Banto Zame.\nMELANIE: Where did you come by a name like that?\nBANTO: ZAME Osphogus.\nDOCTOR: WHO Osphogus? That's a superdense mudball, nothing could live there.\nBANTO: ZAME They terraformed it five thousand years ago.\nDOCTOR: WHO Of course. Forgive me, I’m a little out of touch.\nBANTO: ZAME You actually are a Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: WHO Feel my chest. Two hearts.\nBANTO: ZAME By the Deities... it’s true.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Let me have a feel. (Sexy) Hmmm... Flipping heck.\nDOCTOR: WHO Both beating strong and true. Though perhaps a little faster than usual given the circumstances.\nMELANIE: Yes, we must get on with finding the Tribute.\nBANTO: ZAME Wouldn't it be more sensible just to use this marvellous machine to get away from here?\nMELANIE: We can’t just abandon the people of Generios. SALLY-ANNE Why not? We don’t owe them nothing.\nMELANIE: Your research on the Doctor can’t have been very thorough. He would never abandon anyone while there was a chance of saving them.\nDOCTOR: WHO Admirably put, Mel. Unlike some of us here, it seems, I have a particular aversion to system-wide genocide. Now — Banto Zame. I overheard the Councillor giving you a list the three Great Treasures. Where is it?\nMELANIE: I'll take that. So, we’re going after the Tribute, then, Doctor?\nMELANIE: 92\nDOCTOR: WHO I don’t see we have any choice. Now, Mel, where's the first treasure located?\nMELANIE: Let’s see... the first one... on the eighth planet of the system...\nDOCTOR: WHO Then that’s where we need to be.\nBANTO: ZAME Er, Doctor..\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes?\nBANTO: ZAME We're still on Generios right now, aren’t we?\nDOCTOR: WHO Are you about to ask me to open the door and let you out?\nBANTO: ZAME That's about the size of it, yes.\nDOCTOR: WHO Mel?\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh dear — how sad — too late!\nBANTO: ZAME You did that on purpose!\nDOCTOR: WHO Time's running out. With that Cylinder’s forcefield in action I daren’t attempt time travel. We’ve less than three hours left to us and Mel and I will need all the help we can get. And besides — it’s high time you two were taught a lesson.\nMELANIE: Yes - about saving the very people you intended to defraud!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Gently chiding) It doesn’t need spelling out, Mel.\nMELANIE: Oh. Sorry, Doctor,\nDOCTOR: WHO And, er - Sally-Anne, is it?\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Yeah?\nDOCTOR: WHO You can take your hands away now.”\nDOCTOR: 24, INT. CONSTRUCTION PLANET - NIGHT A weird, echoey, empty metallic atmos - threat hangs in the very air. The TARDIS materialises and DOCTOR WHO and co step out.\nMELANIE: I don’t like the look of this place. Just a lot of gloomy, empty corridors.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE ‘Ere, look Banto. That’s what the TARDIST... TARDIS really looks like. Aren’t those little windows sweet?\nBANTO: ZAME Mm. We weren't that far off. Except the colour and —\nDOCTOR: WHO ‘Not thai far...’ no.” No time for that now. What does the list say we’re supposed to be looking for, Mel?\nMELANIE: It just says — Unit 2X419.\nBANTO: ZAME Did you say this was the eighth planet?\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes. Why?\nBANTO: ZAME I read up on the Generios System before we arrived. There was something about the eighth planet...\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes? What?\nBANTO: ZAME Something about it being.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Being what?\nBANTO: ZAME Something. Can't remember.\nMELANIE: Something. Brilliant.\nDOCTOR: WHO Well, was it something good or something bad?\nBANTO: ZAME No, it’s gone.\nBANTO: MELANIE With our record, Doctor, it’s bound to be bad.\nBANTO: 93\nDOCTOR: WHO Not necessarily. In fact, Mel, as time is rather against us.. a\nMELANIE: What?\nDOGTOR: WHO I think you and, er... Sally-Anne should do the job here, while this ‘gentleman’ and I head for stop two.\nDOGTOR: SALLY-ANNE Here, you’re not splitting us up!\nBANTO: ZAME What are you playing at? Wherever we g0, we g0 together!”\nDOCTOR: WHO There really isn’t time to argue.\nBANTO: ZAME (Slightly lusty) Hang on, Doctor. What about — if you go with Sally-Anne, and I go with Melanie?\nMELANIE: Do the ins and outs matter? Millions of people are relying on us. The important thing is to get on with the job in hand.\nBANTO: ZAME (More lustfully) Exactly.\nDOCTOR: WHO Right. If I can take the rest of that list from you, Mel — (FX: Paper ripping.) Then we're set. Sally-Anne and I will be back in one hour. Take care, won't you?\nMELANIE: You too, Doctor\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE You watch it, Banto.\nBANTO: ZAME Watch what?\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE I've seen your eyes, roving all over that ginger piece.\nMELANIE: Don’t worry, Sally-Anne. I’m an expert at defending my honour. (Sotto) I only hope the Doctor can say the same...\nDOCTOR: WHO (From inside the TARDIS) Come along, Sally-Anne! SALLY-ANNE Bye, Banto. See yous in an hour.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE walks into the TARDIS. Door closes.\nBANTO: ZAME So, Melanie — how did you pal up with the Doctor in the first place, then?\nMELANIE: It was quite interesting, actually. I was working as a computer programmer in Brighton when...\nBANTO: ZAME Zerberak’s Trousers! It really can travel through time? MELANIE And space.\nBANTO: ZAME Yeah, but anyone can travel through space. Don’t go boasting about that, people will think you're strange.’ So where is this ‘Brighton’ then?\nMELANIE: East Sussex. Earth.\nBANTO: ZAME Earth, eh? I once met a bloke from Earth, in a pub on Geddon. I wonder if you know him. About five foot ten, called Martin something or other, brownish hair...\nMELANIE: Veto the reminiscences - let’s concentrate on the job in hand. We've got to find Unit 2X419. Whatever it is.”\nBANTO: ZAME What was that?\nMELANIE: What was what?\nBANTO: ZAME I saw something just then — down there — out of the corner of my eye...\nMELANIE: Excellent. Signs of life. This way then.\nBANTO: ZAME (Resigned) I expect you do this sort of thing all the time.\nMELANIE: (Calling back) I suppose I do, actually...\nMELANIE: 94\nMELANIE: throughout this scene. The TARDIS materialises, and DOCTOR WHO and SALLY-ANNE emerge.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Whoa. I could get used to this life.\nDOCTOR: WHO I doubt it. I never have. So here we are... the fourteenth planet of the Generios system.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Not much here is there?\nDOCTOR: WHO Don't be too sure of that. When you've travelled as far and wide as myself, you’ll learn that even the most innocuous-looking places can have hidden depths (sotto) hidden depths with sharp teeth and large guns usually, but, well...\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE But it’s just a big empty quarry.\nDOCTOR: WHO Nevertheless, the list says this is the place... Generios 14, home of Mentos.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE What's Mentos?\nDOCTOR: WHO (With good humour) Another thing you’ll have to learn about me. I never have all the answers.\nDOCTOR: very like the ridiculously overdramatic stings used on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? or The Weakest Link. But from this distance it could almost be a4 clarion call.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE What was that?\nDOCTOR: WHO Didn't you just hear what I said? Whatever it was, it came from that ruin on the horizon.”\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE There ain’t no ruins.\nDOCTOR: WHO Wrong. That crag there... Look again.”\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE There isn’t... Blimey! You're right. It’s like a big old cathedral.\nDOCTOR: WHO Succinctly put.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Perhaps Mentos is in there.\nDOCTOR: WHO My thoughts exactly. Are you fit for a spot of hiking? SALLY-ANNE Hold on. I can’t go charging up there in these shoes.\nDOCTOR: WHO Well, I'll have to leave you then.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE No chance. Here, I’m freezing and all.\nDOCTOR: WHO Mm. It’s not really leotard weather, is it? Take my coat.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Ta. Hey, you're a nice big feller, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: WHO What?\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE (Coy) I like a man with a bit of meat on him. Like a big teddy bear. Keep me all nice and cosy.\nDOCTOR: WHO Young lady, we are on a mission that could spell life or death for millions of innocent people. The comforts or otherwise of my figure are neither here nor there!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Ooh, so we’re playing hard to get, are we?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Resigned) Let’s go and find this Mentos.\nDOCTOR: PX — They start clambering over the rocky ground.\nDOCTOR: 5\nDOCTOR: MEL and BANTO have wandered in to another area — a huge storage section.\nMELANIE: I thought I heard a noise from here...\nBANTO: ZAMS This room — it's huge...\nMELANIE: What are these things? Storage bays?\nBANTO: ZAME But what are they storing?\nMELANIE: Let’s take a closer look. Help me get this down... mind, it’s heavy.\nBANTO: ZAME It’s a... (surprised) chair. It’s just a folding chair.\nMELANIE: There's a note attached to it. ‘Unit DR436. This light, attractive, interlocking, easy-to-assemble chair is the latest innovation from our top design computers. It combines comfort with the spinal support required by (starting to doubt) ...inferior human beings’. I don’t like the sound of that. What else is there?\nBANTO: ZAME I'll get this down.\nBANTO: ZAME (CONT’D) Oh, it’s a lamp. And quite pretty too. ‘Unit EM670. This light, attractive, interlocking, easy-to-assemble anglepoise lighting feature is available in both burnt ochre and cerulean blue finish. Whether you're working or just relaxing, it provides a reassuring glow to relieve the pointless and arbitrary existence of the human being’”\nMELANIE: I get it. This whole place is a massive furniture storage centre — a warehouse.\nBANTO: ZAME (Quietly) Oh no. °\nBANTO: MELANIE And Unit ZX419, the First Great Treasure — it must be somewhere on these shelves.\nBANTO: ZAME Oh no.\nBANTO: MELANIE With this coding system, it should be simplicity itself to\nMELANIE: You go that way, I’ go... What is the matter with you?\nBANTO: ZAME I’ve just remembered. Or rather —- your theory jogged my memory.\nMELANIE: (Getting it) You remember what you read in the guide book? So what did it say about this place?\nBANTO: ZAME Centuries ago this was a thriving planet. One particular company made furniture. It was incredibly successful - supplied the whole system, and far beyond. ”®\nBANTO: MELANIE And then?\nBANTO: ZAME The company execs decided to hand the whole operation over to their assembler robots. They went berserk — and took over. Killed everybody. The entire population of the planet.\nMELANIE: That’s horrible!\nBANTO: ZAME I know.\nMELANIE: Go on.\nBANTO: ZAME Well — that’s it. It’s a dead planet. Nobody’s set foot here from that day on. Until now.\nBANTO: MELANIE And when did all this happen?\nBANTO: ZAME Thousands of years ago.\nBANTO: 96\nBANTO: MELANIE In which case there’s no need to worry. The robots must have packed up by now. Let’s find the Treasure, come on.\nBANTO: Melanie?\nMELANIE: What?\nBANTO: ZAME [’m scared.\nMELANIE: Oh for goodness sakes... hold my hand.\nBANTO: ZAME (Timid) Thank you.\nDOCTOR: WHO and SALLY-ANNE have nearly reached the ruin. They are rather breathless from the climb. FX — We hear the jingle again, much more clearly.\nDOCTOR: WHO Almost there.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE God, my legs are killing me... Where do you get your energy?\nDOCTOR: WHO Plenty of vigorous exercise. A lot of running. SALLY-ANNE (Oh yeah - like jogging and that?\nDOCTOR: WHO No. Running away from things, in general. SALLY-ANNE Let me just get my breath...\nDOCTOR: WHO You certainly are a stark contrast to Mel. I’m usually the one lagging behind.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE There it goes again.\nDOCTOR: WHO And whatever’s making it is in those ruins. Let’s take a peek shall we...? Look, there’s a break in the wall, just here.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE It's weird.\nDOCTOR: WHO Indeed... this must once have been an enormous amphitheatre. e\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Amphi-what?” ‘Ere look! Something’s moving in the middle — on the stage bit...\nDOCTOR: WHO It looks like there's two of them.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Don’t tell me you can see in the dark as well.\nDOCTOR: WHO Plenty of carrot juice... let’s climb inside, get nearer. SALLY-ANNE If we have to. Give us a hand.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE (CONT'D) Careful! You’ve ripped my skirt!\nDOCTOR: WHO Shhhh!”*\nDOCTOR: They slip over to the inside of the ruin.\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT'D) Listen... they’re talking to each other...\nDOCTOR: We hear them. Faintly at first, but increasing in volume as SALLY-ANNE and DOCTOR WHO move closer. The QUESTIONER is a severe woman, with a clipped voice. A hint of Anne Robinson about her. MENTOS is a nervous-sounding, rather frustrated, old-ish man.\nQUESTIONER: Correct. Next round - politics. Who said, ‘A yurnit of quince on Alpha Centauri is not worth a sproobel’s mantivol on\nQUESTIONER: Monoceros?”\nMENTOS: Er... was it... er, was it the Archifrage of Spass?\nQUESTIONER: Correct. Geography. What is the capital of Ferazforon?\nMENTOS: Er... is it... Golostopherea?\nMENTOS: o7\nQUESTIONER: Correct. At the end of that round, your Superbrain score stands at six hundred and sixty-seven billion, eight hundred and fifty-six million, nine hundred and eighty-seven thousand, one hundred and five credits.\nDOCTOR: WHO Incredible. I think it’s some sort of game...\nDOCTOR: MEL and BANTO are still creeping around the bays.\nMELANIE: Here we are... now that was storage bay ZW, so this must be storage bay 2X...\nBANTO: ZAME What was that?\nMELANIE: What?\nBANTO: ZAME I saw a shadow.\nMELANIE: Probably your own. I told you, there’s probably nothing to worry about.\nBANTO: ZAME You like that word, don’t you? Probably. There’s probably nothing to worry about. That was probably just my shadow.\nMELANIE: There’s no point in worrying until you know there’s a problem.”\nBANTO: ZAME Ah - so why are you whispering?\nMELANIE: (Annoyed) Because you are, I suppose. Give me my hand back, you’re getting very clammy. Look — ZX! I was right. It must be right up there at the top. Lift me up.\nBANTO: ZAME All right. Hold still. There you are. Oh no.\nMELANIE: Oh what is it now?\nBANTO: ZAME Oh no.\nMELANIE: Banto, what is it?\nBANTO: ZAME Oh no.\nBANTO: When they speak, it is clipped and mechanised - they sound a bit like the Smash robots.\nMELANIE: Normally I’d ask what they are. But I think I have a pretty good idea. Sorry, Banto.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Humans have infiltrated the storage bays!\nASSEMBLER: 2 Disassemble them! Disassemble them - now!!!\nASSEMBLER: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME. END OF PART TWO.\nASSEMBLER: PART THREE”\nASSEMBLER: MEL and BANTO are still creeping around the bays.\nMELANIE: Here we are... now that was storage bay ZW, so this must be storage bay ZX...\nBANTO: ZAME What was that?\nMELANIE: What?\nBANTO: ZAME I saw a shadow.\nMELANIE: Probably your own. I told you, there’s probably nothing to worry about.\nBANTO: ZAME You like that word, don’t you? Probably. There's probably nothing to worry about, That was probably just my shadow.\nMELANIE: There's no point in worrying until you know there’s a problem.”*\nBANTO: ZAME Ah - so why are you whispering?\nMELANIE: (Annoyed) Because you are, I suppose.

Oh no.\nMELANIB: Oh what is it now?\nMELANIE: Banto, what is it?\nBANTO: ZAME Oh no.\nBANTO: When they speak, it is clipped and mechanised — they sound a bit like the Smash robots.\nMELANIE: Normally I’d ask what they are. But I think I have a pretty good idea. Sorry, Banto.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Humans have infiltrated the storage bays!\nASSEMBLER: 2 Disassemble them! Disassemble them - now!!!\nMELANIE: No! Wait!\nASSEMBLER: 2 We do not accept the orders of organics.\nMELANIE: You can’t kill us!\nBANTO: ZAME (Praying) I’m so sorry, Mother...\nMELANIE: Banto, let me down.\nBANTO: ZAME I never meant to take that five nim note out of your purse..\nASSEMBLER: 2 These organic spies must be disassembled.\nBANTO: ZAME ...I only needed it to..\nMELANIE: You’ ve got to hear me out! We aren't spies!\nASSEMBLER: 2 A typical organic untruth.\nMELANIE: We're working for the good of this planet — of the entire system. If we don’t complete our mission here, you and all your kind will be destroyed for sure.\nBANTO: ZAME Forget it, Mel — you can’t reason with those things!”\nBANTO: 99\nASSEMBLER: 1 On the contrary, human - we Assemblers are creatures of pure reason.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Indeed. Do not judge us by your own puny human standards.\nMELANIE: Sorry. But I'm serious. Back me up, Banto.\nBANTO: ZAME (Talking for his life) Yes, your magnificences... metallic masters... If we don't get... er, what is it...?\nMELANIE: Unit ZX419.\nBANTO: ZAME Unit XZ491...\nMELANIE: Zx419l%\"\nBANTO: ZAMB Unit ZX419 — there’s a big nasty thing out in space that'll kill us all! Think what it'll do to all this lovely furniture...”\nASSEMBLER: 1 Unit 2X419? Did you say Unit ZX419°?\nMELANIE: Yes. Several times.\nASSEMBLER: 1 That unit is our greatest achievement.\nASSEMBLER: 2A synthesis of our most brilliant designs - lovingly pincer-crafted.\nASSEMBLER: 1 It has taken nearly fifty million dekkons to produce.\nBANTO: ZAME Dekkons?\nASSEMBLER: 1 A dekkon is equivalent to sixty of your —\nMELANIE: Oh no -~ let’s not got bogged down in all that again.\nASSEMBLER: 1 There are no bogs on this planet.\nASSEMBLER: 2 I think the organic ‘Mel’ was making a feeble metaphor.\nASSEMBLER: 1 So typical of the inefficiency of the human mind. (To the humans) Your story is clearly a ploy.\nASSEMBLER: 2 You intend to trick us into parting with Unit 2X419.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Our suspicion circuits are tingling.\nASSEMBLER: 2 With suspicion.\nMELANIE: You've got to believe us. And quickly - time is of the essence.\nBANTO: ZAME (Despairing) Oh, come on then! Disassemble us! At least it'll be quick and painless. I assume.\nBANTO: The ASSEMBLERS laugh.\nBANTO: ZAME (CONT'D) Oh dear.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Prepare to meet your manufacturer, intruders!\nMELANIE: No — please! Every word we've said is true!\nASSEMBLER: 1 Yes -— wait, 2.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Wait, 1? Why must we wait?™*\nASSEMBLER: 1 These humans wish to take Unit ZX419...\nASSEMBLER: 2 (Wary) Yes?\nASSEMBLER: 1 (Sinister undertones) Then perhaps we... should let them take it.\nASSEMBLER: 2 What?\nASSEMBLER: 1 Think about it.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Eh? (Catching on) Oh... Yes.\nASSEMBLER: The ASSEMBLERS laugh again\nBANTO: ZAME Phew. That’s all right then. (Doubtful I think.\nMELANIE: Ever heard of jumping out of the frying pan?\nBANTO: ZAME No, actually.\nMELANIE: (Sighs) I can ses why the Doctor never comes to this end of time — it’s like talking a different language. It’s an expression — out of the frying pan and into the fire.\nMELANIE: 100\nBANTO: ZAME What’s a frying pan?\nMELANIE: You use it to fry food - on a hob...*\nASSEMELER: 1 Enough talk of this foolish Earth ‘pan’.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Stand back and we will retrieve the unit you seek. Stand back!\nASSEMBLER: As ASSEMBLER 2's arms extend and reach up for the Unit we cut away to...\nQUESTIONER: What D was signed in the 49th reign of the Great Oceloth of Grunj?”\nMENTOS: Br... um... that’d be... the Dinarian Treaty.\nQUESTIONER: Correct. Who represented Venus in the 2059 Intergalactic Song Contest?\nMENTOS: Er... um... I know this one...”\nQUESTIONER: I'll have to hurry you.\nMENTOS: Erm... was it X-Karumb’i click-chirrup-chirrup?\nQUESTIONER: Correct. And for an extra point, the full title of the song?\nMENTOS: Easy. T’lla-for-zeba-er-korrok. Brackets — baby.\nQUESTIONER: Correct.\nQUESTIONER: Over this, DOCTOR WHO and SALLY-ANNE are conferring. SALLY-ANNE This is mental.\nDOCTOR: WHO Perhaps the only relic of an entire civilisation. SALLY-ANNE If everybody’s dead, perhaps they’re ghosts.\nDOCTOR: WHO Ghosts? No. Not enough clanking chains and icy chills! SALLY-ANNE (Muttering) Well I'm cold enough!\nDOCTOR: WHO Far more likely the products of advanced technology.” Look at the contestant, Sally-Anne — closely.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE The feller? No. What?\nDOCTOR: WHO Look again.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE No, I can't see nothing.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Urging) More closely.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Look, I can't see anything, so just tell me!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Dryly) I love an enquiring mind. (Sighs) He's standing on a box. To my eyes, that box looks very like a sophisticated computer. SALLY-ANNE How can you tell?\nDOCTOR: WHO Compare it to the rest of this place. All in ruins - a toppled empire. But that box is pristine. Throbbing with energy. SALLY-ANNE Yeah. That’s very clever of you to notice that.\nDOCTOR: WHO I am very clever.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE And very sexy.\nDOCTOR: WHO And very sexy... no, no, let’s not start all that again.” Whatever it may be, that box has unique properties.” Ergo...? SALLY-ANNE It’s Mentos!\nDOCTOR: WHO You got there in the end.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE That box is Mentos! Great, let’s go and get it! 'U sneak up behind the old bloke, you grab his arms, push him off and I’ll nab the box!\nDOCTOR: WHO Steady on. We don’t know the full situation — so we won't just blunder in.”\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE (Sulky) Oh, all right. Whatever you say.\nDOCTOR: 101\nDOCTOR: WHO Allow me to demonstrate the correct etiquette for the space/time traveller.\nDOCTOR: WHO walks into the open.\nDOCTOR: WHO (CONT'D) (Grandly) Hello down there. I am known as the Doctor.\nQUESTIONER: (Breaking off) Please, sir - we're on air. The audience are not permitted to leave their seats. If you want to use the lavatory please wait.\nDOCTOR: WHO Ah, my mission is rather more urgent.\nQUESTIONER: We're in the middle of the show.\nMENTOS: Don’t listen to her, old chap. I’m glad of a break. You know, I could have sworn the audience ali died.\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE Died?\nDOCTOR: WHO Exactly how long has this show of yours been running?\nMENTOS: ican answer that one. Thirty-three thousand years. QUESTIONER And we need to carry on, sir, madam, so please — return to your seats.\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE Hold on. It’s just Mentos we're after, not you two!\nMENTOS: But I am Mentos.\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE Eh? But Doctor, you said...\nDOCTOR: WHO (Interrupting, musing) Yes, that would make sense. The Mentos device creates a real-world interface for itself. (To Mentos) So you're a projection?\nMENTOS: Top marks!\nQUESTIONER: Can we please stop these unauthorised questions? You're distracting the contestant.\nDOCTOR: WHO I’m sorry, madam, but we require Mentos'’s aid urgently.\nQUESTIONER: You can have him as soon as I’ve finished with him at the end of the game.\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANNE All right, then. Hurry up.\nDOCTOR: WHO We’ll just wait here.\nMENTOS: I don’t think you understand, Doctor. I'm to remain here until 1 fail to answer a question.\nDOCTOR: WHO So?\nMENTOS: I’m the only contestant.\nDOCTOR: WHO I can see that.\nMENTOS: No - ever.\nDOCTOR: WHO What - you mean... you've been here...\nMENTOS: For three hundred and thirty centuries, yes. After all, Iam Mentos. I know everything.\nMENTOS: The ASSEMBLERS have fetched the unit from the rack.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Behold, humans! Unit 2X419. The crowning glory of our Tace. Open the box, 2.\nASSEMBLER: sting of choral, almost holy music. A beat.\nBANTO: ZAME It’s just a lot of wooden boards.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Pitiful organic. The true elegance and functionality of the unit is clearly beyond its understanding.\nASSEMBLER: 1 (With meaning) Precisely, 2.\nASSEMBLER: 102\nASSEMBLER: 2 Ah yes. Of course, 1.\nASSEMBLER: They laugh once more.\nBANTO: ZAME (Sotto) Call me a pessimist, Mel, but I don't like the way this is going.\nMELANIE: Mm. They’ve obviously got something up their sleeves.\nBANTO: ZAME Yes, pincers. Big, fierce, razor-sharp metal pincers which...\nASSEMBLER: 1 Do not fear, human. Your disassemblage has been... delayed.\nBANTO: ZAME Oh. Good.\nMELANIE: Don't think me ungrateful for the stay of execution, but why? Your friend over there was keen as mustard to kill us a few moments ago.\nASSEMBLER: 1 You show interest in Unit ZX419. This... pleases us. But before you can take it — you must construct it.\nASSEMBLER: MELANIE The instructions are attached to this bit. It looks simple enough. A straightforward shelving unit.”\nBANTO: ZAME Shelves? How can a set of shelves be one of the three great treasures of the system?\nASSEMBLER: 2 Do not blaspheme!\nASSEMBLER: 1 These sheives are like no others. Now - you have thirty dekkons to assemble unit ZX419. If you succeed you may leave with it. If you fail —\nASSEMBLER: 2@ You will be disassembled!\nMELANIE: Sorry — thirty dekkons?\nASSEMBLER: 2 Half of one pitiful human hour.\nBANTO: ZAME Better get cracking then.\nASSEMBLER: 1 We shall withdraw and observe on our visiscope.”\nASSEMBLER: 2 We would not wish to... distract you.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Remember - thirty dekkons.\nBANTO: ZAME (Sotto) Mel, let’s just leg it with the goods. This place is massive. I'm sure we could find a good hiding place until...\nBANTO: them. Close, echoing atmos from now on with appropriate noises as they construct the shelves.\nMELANIE: They were hardly likely to have overlooked that. Right. (Reading) ‘Insert Rod A into stanchion G while screwing nails B and D into aperture F as seen in Figs 1a and Se’.\nBANTO: ZAME Let's have a go.\nMELANIE: You hold this section.\nBANTO: ZAME That must be Rod A.”\nMELANIE: That’s stanchion G.” There we go, easy.\nBANTO: ZAME How are we going to screw the nails in without a screwdriver?\nBANTO: floor. The shutter clangs down again.\nMELANIE: Oh. Thanks. Right, let’s see... ‘Extend the nut on supports J and KE...’\nBANTO: ZAME Righto. Done that.\nMELANIE: Slide shelf 1 into aperture A... Hold on, what’s happened? Did you touch that while I wasn’t looking?\nMELANIE: 103\nBANTO: ZAME Touch what? I haven’t touched a thing.\nMELANIE: Rod A — and stanchion G - where are they?\nBANTO: ZAME Isn't that them?\nMELANIE: No!\nBANTO: ZAME You had them in your hand a second ago. You must have put them down.\nMELANIS: But... I fast... (confused) I don't get it. A moment ago...\nBANTO: ZAME I knew it was too good to be true. I bet they’re having a right chuckle on that visiscope.\nMELANIE: Jt should be simple as long as we follow the instructions. Right. ‘Insert dowels provided into pre-drilled holes on surface W as shown in Figs 51, 9 and 17D’\nBANTO: ZAME Mel. Is it just me...\nMELANIE: What? I’m trying to concentrate.\nBANTO: ZAME Those instructions look as if they’re getting bigger.\nMELANIE: Don’t be ridiculous. Come on, help! (Determined) We’re going to do this, Banto. Together. Right then you take bracket F there...\nMELANIE: The QUESTIONER has resumed her questioning. MENTOS has no choice but to continue.\nQUESTIONER: What are the young of the Pontam race called?\nMENTOS: The... oh, it’s on the tip of my mind... the Letlills?\nQUESTIONER: Correct.\nDOCTOR: WHO Excuse me. I don’t know if I made myself clear...\nQUESTIONER: Please be quiet, sir.\nDOCTOR: WHO Madam, if I may just collect the Mentos device, I'll be out of your way...\nDOCTOR: QUESTIONER The questions must continue.\nDOCTOR: WHO Here, let me disconnect the box...\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Doctor! Doctor! (To the QUESTIONER) You've — killed him!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Groaning) No she hasn’t. Just an electric shock to the head. (To SALLY-ANNE) You know, you’re getting the hang of this. SALLY-ANNE (Made up) Thanks!\nMENTOS: I knew she wouldn’t let you disconnect me, Doctor. Would it were that easy to leave this place...\nQUESTIONER: We must continue.\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANNE I get it. She’s been programmed to carry on with the game, whatever.\nMENTOS: Correct. SALLY-ANNE And you’ve been programmed to answer her questions?\nMENTOS: More than that —I have been programmed to answer any\nMENTOS: question. The box you see beneath me is merely a portal.\nDOCTOR: WHO To a controlling intelligence?\nDOCTOR: MENTOS To a team of electronic research devices and intelligence gatherers suspended in a shadow universe. They work tirelessly to gather information on our own universe — to which I am merely the interface.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Stunned) That is — incredible.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE I don’t like it when you get flabbergasted.”\nDOCTOR: 104\nDOCTOR: WHO Flabbergasted? Too small a word for such a concept. One of the greatest advancements of technology ever...\nMENTOS: (Modestly) Thank you.\nDOCTOR: WHO The supreme achievement... makes the Matrix of Gallifrey look like a Ladybird book...\nMENTOS: I say, you’ll make me blush.\nDOCTOR: WHO But what happened to the civilisation that created you?\nQUESTIONER: Look around you.\nDOCTOR: WHO War?\nMENTOS: Two sides, ideologically opposed, wanted to get their hands on me.\nDOCTOR: WHO And wiped each other out? Leaving you stranded here?\nMENTOS: Yes. Coming on ‘Superbrain’ was a gimmick. A test run, if you like, to show off my abilities to the plebs. Unfortunately, until the correct code is released into the panel you see beneath me, I am irrevocably conditioned to answer questions. And before you ask, the only other people who knew the code were my designers, and they’re long dead.\nMENTOS: QUESTIONER And I am programmed to select questions - from throughout all time and space. Until Mentos is bested and the code released. Now, we must return to the game.\nQUESTIONER: Who invented the Spode Catcher?\nMENTOS: Ah... er... Finkum the Lesser.\nQUESTIONER: What's the infinite cube root of the hypothetical number uinv?\nQUESTIONER: MENTOS The hypothetical number uinv... would it be the theoretical locus plyff?\nDOCTOR: WHO and SALLY-ANNE confer.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Look, we can’t just hang about all day hoping that brainbox there is gonna slip up.\nDOCTOR: WHO You're right. We'll have to think of something. Some distraction...\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE I'l! just distract that cranky old bag and you run in and get the box?\nDOCTOR: WHO You saw what happened before. That was a nasty knock I took.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE So there’s nothing we can do.\nDOCTOR: WHO Apparently not.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE We're finished. The whole system’s finished.\nDOCTOR: WHO Quite — we’re doomed, utterly doomed...'\"' Hold on, hold on’ — as my companion, you’re supposed to try and rouse me from my sloughs of despond. Not encourage them!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE I've always been a bit of a gloomy sort. (Sighs) What a life. Dad walked out when I was six. Mum hit the bottle. Brother knocked down by a speeding hover car. (Getting teary) Me poor auntie Sue gobbled up by one of the Spaags of Vishtek 3...\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Is it any wonder I turned to crime? I was led astray by Banto. He promised me the universe. And look where I end up.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Awkward) There, there. Have my hanky.’”\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Ts. (Blows nose) Give us a cuddle, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: 105\nDOCTOR: WHO Er... there you go... : SALLY-ANNE At least we'll go together when we go. You know, you've got a very comfortable shoulder.\nDOCTOR: WHO Wait a moment!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE What?\nDOCTOR: WHO I've had an ideal\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Is this the Time Lord way of giving a girl the brush-off?\nDOCTOR: WHO Questioner —\nQUESTIONER: Your interruptions are futile, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO I don't think so. You say you are programmed to find a question Mentos cannot answer?\nQUESTIONER: (Wary) Yes.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Proudly) I think I have such a question. Will you allow me to put it to him?\nDOCTOR: MEL and BANTO are still struggling with the shelves.\nMELANIE: ‘Slot stanchion G into the base unit...’ Hold on, I’m certain I've already done that...\nBANTO: ZAME That was stanchion D, and it wasn’t the base unit, it was the central support stand.\nMELANIE: But where’s that?\nBANTO: ZAME (Puzzled) Er... I dunno...\nMELANIE: This is so complicated. The instructions seem to make sense, but we never seem to get any nearer actually putting it all together.\nBANTO: ZAME What does it say next, let’s have a look... ‘Balance lower shelf on support Y, then use Allen key provided to — ‘\nMELANIE: Now hold on. We finished the lower shelves, I’m positive.\nBANTO: ZAME No, look.'”’\nMELANIE: But J remember finishing that section.\nBANTO: ZAME Perhaps you're confused.\nMELANIE: No. I've got a memory like an elephant.'” (Chuckles) A running gag I share with the Doctor.\nBANTO: ZAME I bet the hours just fly by.\nMELANIE: (Working it out) Yes, there’s the section we finished... in which case, these parts here — must be new.'™\nZAME: I'm not going to say ‘but that’s impossible’ again.\nMELANIE: You know what this means, Banto?\nBANTO: ZAME (Sarcastic) Really good news?\nMELANIE: These shelves are a cheat. Parts of them keep appearing and disappearing.\nBANTO: ZAME Eh? We’d see it.\nMELANTE: Not if the maths involved was sufficiently developed. It would be beyond our senses to see it happening.\nBANTO: ZAME I'm sure this is all very clever, but you've lost me. It’s just a lot of shelves. (Thinks) Except - it’s one of the three Great Treasures, so it must have special properties...\nMELANIE: Yes. The ability to slip in and out of different dimensions. That’s why they let us try and do this. Don’t you see?\nBANTO: ZAME We can never finish putting up the shelves because...\nBANTO: 106\nMELANIE: . .they’re slipping in and out of our reality. We can never catch up.\nBANTO: ZAME (Gloomy) That’s it then.\nMELANIE: What are you doing?\nBANTO: ZAME We've got about ten minutes before they come back in and finish us off. ’'ll be damned if I'm going to spend the last ten minutes of my life putting up shelves!\nMELANIE: You can’t just lie there!\nBANTO: ZAME Exactly what do you think I should be doing instead?\nMELANIE: Listen. The last thing Melanie Jane Bush is going to do is give up.\nBANTO: ZAME It’s hopeless, you said it yourself.\nMELANIE: Listen. I used to live in a small town called Pease Pottage. Every year my mum and dad organised a Christmas show for local pensioners in the church hall. That year the snow fell eight feet deep. We lived in a big house about seven miles from the town. There was no way for us to drive in. Everybody else gave up. But not my mum and dad, and not me. ‘We're Bushes, said my mum. ‘And we’re made of stronger stuff. Those old folk are relying on us’. So we put on our wellies, jumpers and sou’westers, packed a steaming thermos, hoisted our bags and boxes of costumes and props, and we strode off into the deep snow, setting our faces against the biting wind. And though it was hard, and the road was long, we made it to that church hall, and we gave that show! So don’t talk to me about giving up, because I’m a Bush, and Bushes never do!!”” There is a long pause.\nASSEMBLER: 1 (From outside) We would remind the humans they have only twelve dekkons left to complete the task.'i¢\nMELANIE: Oh. Yes, sorry. Got a bit carried away.\nBANTO: ZAME (Sincere) Mel — you're right.\nMELANIE: (Surprised) Am I?\nBANTO: ZAME (Falling in love) That was the most beautiful story I’ve ever heard.\nMELANIE: Was it?\nBANTO: ZAME You don't understand. Where I come from nobody believes in anything. You really do.\nMELANIE: (Awkward) Thanks. Look, let’s try and think of something...\nBANTO: ZAME By the way - did the pensioners enjoy their show?\nMELANIE: No, none of them turned up.'\nMELANIE: podium.\nQUESTIONER: You are honoured, Doctor. The first audience member to question Mentos.\nDOCTOR: WHO Thank you, madam.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Go on, Doctor. You can do it.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Clears throat) Now — Mentos?\nMENTOS: Yes?\nMENTOS: 107\nDOCTOR: WHO Let me get this straight. If I ask a question you cannot answer, you will be free, and I can take you with me?\nMENTOS: Yes.\nDOCTOR: WHO Right. Now then.\nDOCTOR: QUESTIONER The rules allow you only two questions, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO Very well. I doubt I'll need my second go.\nMENTOS: Ooh, Doctor — you’re not going to try one of those tricky fox-the-computer logic conundrums, are you? You know, ‘if I’m lying was the last thing I said true’ and all that nonsense?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Covering) Um... No.'”\nMENTOS: Good. Because I can answer those, you know?\nDOCTOR: WHO Really? Oh. (Thinking quickly) Very well. Here goes. What colour was the wallpaper in the back bedroom of number 35 Jefferson Road, Woking, in June 1975?\nMENTOS: Purple.\nDOCTOR: WHO What?\nMENTOS: Purple. Easy. Next.\nDOCTOR: WHO How could you possibly...\nMENTOS: We sent a research device there to find out. You’ll have to do better than that.'\"'\nDOCTOR: WHO I can hardly believe it.\nMENTOS: I'm more interested to know how you know the answer.\nDOCTOR: WHO I based myself in Woking during a Cybermen invasion.'*\nMENTOS: Oh, of course.\nDOCTOR: WHO So how come you didn’t know that?\nMENTOS: Oh, I can’t send requests for information, Doctor, I have to be asked.\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE Fantastic. Try a harder one.\nQUESTIONER: Next question please, Doctor. Your second and final question.\nDOCTOR: WHO Erm... try this one... It’s in three parts.\nQUESTIONER: Tch... I suppose it’s allowed...\nDOCTOR: WHO What were my three wishes as I blew out the candles on my nine hundredth birthday cake?\nMENTOS: Ah... oh... er...\nDOCTOR: WHO That’s got you foxed.\nMENTOS: Er... wait a minute... it’s a tough one...\nDOCTOR: WHO I'll have to hurry you.\nQUESTIONER: ! say that.\nDOCTOR: WHO Sorry.\nQUESTIONER: 1['ll have to hurry you.\nMENTOS: Well, it’s... oh...\nDOCTOR: WHO Game, set and match to myself, I think. Questioner, if you'll allow me to disconnect the box?\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Well done, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Smug) Mentos can see anywhere — but not, I think, into the mind of a Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: eae Wait, I’ve got it. Wish one — peace throughout the alaxy.\nDOCTOR: WHO I don’t believe it... how?\nMENTOS: Wish two - er...\nDOCTOR: WHO Hah. A lucky guess. Come on.'!®\nDOCTOR: 108\nMENTOS: Wish two — better control of the TARDIS... SALLY-ANNE Is he right?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Downcast) Incredibly, yes. But don’t fret, he’ll never get the third one...\nMENTOS: Er... oh, it’s so nearly there...\nBOCTOR: WHO Your time’s running out, Mentos.\nMENTOS: Ah... oh... ah yes. Wish three - more manageable hair.\nDOCTOR: WHO (Shocked) Good grief! How did you know that?\nMENTOS: Hasy really. Remember later that day you were locked in a dungeon by the evil Mantelli?'””\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes.\nMENTOS: Remember your cellmate?\nDOCTOR: WHO It was an old man, shackled to the wall. Asked me what I'd been doing, and I... oh no. It was you!\nMENTOS: Another projection of me, yes. Very clever, those research devices.'\"* Took me a while to get it out of you.\nQUESTIONER: (Prim, mocking) So, Doctor, you travel through space and time, yes?\nDOCTOR: WHO That’s right.\nQUESTIONER: Meet a lot of interesting people do you?\nDOCTOR: WHO Well yes, I...\nQUESTIONER: Then it’s a shame some of them couldn't have been here instead of you. Please return to your seat. You have been defeated by Mentos. You are the feeblest contestant. Goodbye.\nDOCTOR: WHO It’s impossible. We're fighting the greatest resource of information the universe has ever known - even my mind is no match. We'd have more chance of beating a squad of Daleks with a rolled up newspaper.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANWE Oh, come on. Here, let me have a go.'’? Oi! Questioner!'””\nDOCTOR: WHO If you like. Though I don’t think it'll do any good. I suppose you could ask him ~\nQUESTIONER: No conferring!\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANWE I've got a good question worked out. Don’t worry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO makes a despairing sound.’\nQUESTIONER: Sally-Anne Stubbins — will you please come up to the hot spot?\nQUESTIONER: Sally-Anne, you have two questions.\nBOCTOR: WHO (To himself over the above) Wait! I’ve got it, I know what to ask... How could I have been so stupid...'?\nBOCTOR: SALLY-ANNB Right. What did I tell Banto on the night when he asked me to marry him, just after we'd downed that third bottle of red. (To\nDOCTOR: WHO) He'll never get this one, cos Banto’s never told another living soul. He promised.\nMENTOS: You... er. Oh, what was it? Yes, of course. You told him you'd had... I hardly like to say it.\nQUESTIONER: Your answer please, Mentos.\nMENTOS: Well, that you’d had... uh... mammary enhancement surgery. He was out for a drink the following evening, you see. Told all his friends. One of my gatherers was there. Apparently he thought you'd also had your cheeks sucked in and your lips —\nMENTOS: 109\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE (Interrupting, furfous) The scumbag! I'll get him for that\nQUESTIONER: One question left.\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANNE Oh, flippin’ ‘eck. It’s impossible. (Gabbling, not actually asking a question) 1 mean, what don’t you know?\nMENTOS: Er...\nQUESTIONER: Is that your second question?\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANNE No, hang on...'”\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes! Yes, that’s her second question! Mentos — what don’t\nMENTOS: Er... I’m sure I'll have the answer soon... it’s going to be a bit tricky...'\"* er...!”°\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE What have I done?\nDOCTOR: WHO Pulled the cat out of the bag is what you've done! Great minds do think alike after all.'” Come here!\nDOCTOR: WHO grabs her and fives her a quick, exuberant kiss on the cheek. SALLY-ANNE Cob, Doctor.'”\nDOCTOR: Mentos.\nMENTOS: Wait, please, I...\" I'm sending my research devices...'?> 1... er... what is happening?'”> Mentos overloaded...'2* cannot answer...'*° (slurring)... portal closing down...’° code released...\nQUESTIONER: Mentos, that is the end of your time here on Superbrain. Do you want to come back next week?\nMENTOS: Certainly not! I am - closing down... closing down...\nMENTOS: SALLY-ANNE He's disappeared!\nDOCTOR: WHO Merely retreated into his shell. Good. I hate clever clogs.\nQUESTIONER: You have banked a pitiful six hundred and seventy-nine billion,three hundred and thirty-three million, five hundred and sixty- seven thousand, and ten credits.’”” Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye...\nQUESTIONER: metallic-sounding clang.\nQUESTIONER: SALLY-ANNE What happened to her?\nDOCTOR: WHO Game over. No need for a questioner any longer. Now come on - let’s disconnect the box and get back to the others.'”\nDOCTOR: 34, INT. CONSTRUCTION PLANET CELL - DAY We hear the voice of ASSEMBLER 1 on the intercom.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Two dekkons remaining, human weaklings.\nBANTO: ZAME Two minutes! Two minutes of life. What can you do with two minutes?\nMELANIE: Quiet, will you — I’m trying to think.\nBANTO: ZAME It’s amazing. You don’t seem scared at all.\nMELANIE: No point in it. Believe me, when I’m scared I'll scream the paint off the walls.\nMELANIE: Yes?\nBANTO: ZAME Can I hold your hand?\nMELANIE: If it makes you feel better.\nBANTO: ZAME Thanks. It does. You know, in ancther time, another Place... I might've set my cap at you.\nBANTO: 110\nMELANIE: (Gently sarcastic) Thanks. Perhaps in another dimension we got together and had tons of odd-looking children... hang on!\nBANTO: ZAME What?\nMELANIE: I think I’ve got it!\nBANTO: ZAME Got what?\nBANTO: MELANIE A way out! These shelves can never be fully assembled, yes?\nBANTO: ZAME If you say so\nMELANIE: So those robot things out there can’t have ever seen the finished unit.\nBANTO: ZAME (Still unconvinced) Makes sense, I s’pose...\nMELANIE: Then how will they know whether we’ve put it together correctly? We've done all we can, so let’s just gather up the rest of the pieces (she does so while talking) — the ones currently in our dimension, anyway — and pile them on top!\nBANTO: ZAME That'll never work! There must be a picture of the end product somewhere on these instructions...\nBANTO: ZAME Hey! Hey you're right! You can’t even get to the end of the instructions. There’s always more... oh this is doing my brain no good at all!\nMELANIE: Never mind that! Quick, help me with all this.\nMELANIE: stopped as the shutters slide up and the ASSEMBLERS trundle in, chittering.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Your thirty dekkons are up, Earth creatures.\nMELANIE: (Bluffing) And a very fine job we've done, I’m sure you'll agree.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Prepare your internal organs for... whaaaat?\nASSEMBLER: 1 What did you say?\nMELANIE: Unit ZX419. We assembied it. Look.\nBANTO: ZAME (Whispering) They aren't going to fall for this, surely?\nMELANIB: (To BANTO) Play along. (To the ASSEMBLERS) It wasn’t all that difficult once we got the hang of it.\nBANTOZAME: Yes... you tried to fool us, you naughty robots. But we soon saw through it.\nMELANIE: So if you don’t mind we’ll be on our way.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Wait! You cannot have assembled Unit Z2X419!\nMELANIE: Why not? They’re only shelves.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Very special shelves. Our finest achievement — the Shelves of Infinity!\nMELANIE: Oh, you mean the dimensional trickery. Didn’t take us long to work that out. Did it Banto?\nBANTO: ZAME Yeah, we're dab hands when it comes to, er...\nMELANIE: Multi-reality cogency phasing. It's simple — you just train your mind to think in the abstract and you can see thirty seven dimensions all at the same time.\nMELANIE: The ASSEMBLERS confer.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Can this be possible?\nASSEMBLER: 2 We must examine the Shelves of Infinity.\nMELANIE: Feel free. You see — finished.\nASSEMBLER: 2 This is an organic untruth!\nASSEMBLER: 11\nASSEMBLER: MELANIE Of course it isn’t. Look, check on the instructions.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Let me see... stanchion G is supported by rod 6... the interlocking nuts 9b and 4a have been tightened, yes...\nASSEMBLER: 1 It will take us some time to check the truth of your claim.\nBANTO: ZAME That wasn’t part of the deal. Thirty dekkons you said.\nMELANIE: Surely it won’t take the Great Assemblers that long to examine their own shelves?\nASSEMBLER: 1 Of course not!\nASSEMBLER: 2 We are superior!\nASSEMBLER: MELANI5 Well then. (Under her breath) Come on, Doctor!\nBANTO: ZAMB You're not trying to back out of the deal, are you? Tsk, tsk.'? And I thought you were honourable creatures.\nASSEMBLER: 2 We are beings of our word - unlike humans.\nMELANIE: Let's have the shelves then.\nMELANIE: the shelves.\nASSEMBLER: 2 There is conflict in my circuits, 1.\nASSEMBLER: 1 And in mine, 2.\nASSEMBLER: 2 We are superior to humans.\nASSEMBLER: I Undoubtedly.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Then how can the humans have completed their task?!”\nASSEMBLER: 1 We must examine these instructions closely, 2.\nMELANIB: Right on time for once! Come on Banto, help me with the shelves!\nMELANIB: as they run, perhaps interlocking nut 9a tinkles to the floor.\nBANTO: ZAME I’m right behind you!\nASSEMBLER: 1 What is this blue cuboid object with windows and writing on the door? ‘Pull to open...’ Are these its instructions?\nMELANIE: (Calling back) It’s something we made earlier.\nBANTO: ZAME Goodbye, creeps!\nASSEMBLERS: approach the TARDIS.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Emerge from this cuboid!\nASSEMBLER: 2 Bring back the Shelves of Infinity!\nASSEMELER: 1 We must disassemble this box, 2.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Yes, 1. Advance, advance!\nASSEMBLER: 1 Disassemble, disassemble!\nASSEMBLER: 2 You will return!\nASSEMBLER: 1 We are superior! We are superior!\nASSEMBLER: 2 We have been beaten by humans, 1.\nASSEMBLER: 1 Yes, 2. It is not possible.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Thus — it cannot have happened.\nASSEMBLER: 1 We shall erase it from our memories.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Erase! Erase!'*'\nASSEMBLER: 1 That is better.\nASSEMBLER: 2 Now - let us go and assemble a new design. How about — @ sun lounger and chairs in matching lavender?\nASSEMBLER: 112\nASSEMBLER: 1 Or footstools and occasional table with accompanying pouffe?’*\nASSEMBLER: 2 1 know — we shall assemble both\nDOCTOR: WHO Mel, it’s very good to see you. I only hope your excursion was less fraught with peril than mine and Sally-Anne’s.\nMELANIE: I'd rather not dwell on the detail, Doctor. Suffice it to say, I hope these were worth it.\nDOCTOR: WHO Forgive me — but they do rather resemble shelves.\nMELANIE: They are shelves. Special shelves. (ScepticaD What about your treasure? It’s just a box.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE A very special box, actually.\nBANTO: ZAME Before we all get carried away with the explanations —\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes?\nBANTO: ZAME - there’s still another treasure to find.\nMELANIE: He’s right, and we’ve only got about twenty-five minutes\nBANTO: ZAME (Weary) My life seems to lurch from one countdown to another.\nDOCTOR: WHO Hah! Can’t take the pace, eh? That'll teach you to imitate somebody less awe-inspiring next time!\nBANTO: ZAME Awe-inspiring? In that coat? Have you looked in the mirror recently? Come to think of it, I shouldn’t think you do much else...\nDOCTOR: WHO I intend to rise above your barbs. (Pause) But before I do, I'd like to say that this coat can only be appreciated by someone with a sharpened aesthetic sense - not a dunderhead like you!\nBANTO: ZAME Sharpened aesthetic sense? Sharpened by what — a dose of mind-altering drugs?\nDOCTOR: WHO I warn you - a verbal duel against me, as you should remember, if you used the smallest fraction of your cerebral cortex occasionally, ean only end in ignominy for you!'**\nBANTO: ZAME Igno-what? Talking to you is like arguing with a thesaurus!\nDOCTOR: WHO It pays to enrich your word power!\nMELANIE: Doctor, Banto! Please!\nDOCTOR: WHO I'm sorry, Mel. (Pause) But he started it.\nBANTO: ZAME J did not! You did!’*\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE Shut up!\nMELANIE: Can we please get on with finding the treasure?\nDOCTOR: WHO Already covered. In fact we’re just about to materialise. SALLY-ANNE/MELANIE Where, Doctor?!\"\nMELANIE: Task that question. SALLY-ANNE Suit yourself.\nMELANIE: Where, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: WHO The innermost planet of the system. Generios 15. It’s a gigantic body composed almost entirely of superheated gas.\nBANTO: ZAME Rather like you, then.\nDOCTOR: WHO If I have to endure another insult —\nDOCTOR: 113\nBANTOZAME: Oh here we go, another voyage round the English language —\nMELANIE: C¥elling) Quiet!\nMELANIE: 36, EXT. GAS PLANET - DAY\nMELANIE: materialises. DOCTOR WHO et al step out.\nMELANIE: I don’t like the look of this place.\nBANTO: ZAME Too red for my liking. Red always spells danger.\nDOCTOR: WHO We're not here to discuss the colour scheme. Look around, all of you. According to the list, we should be right on top of the Third Treasure.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE ‘Ere, you don’t reckon it could be the planet itself, do you?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Impressed) Good thinking, Sally-Anne. But no — I did a quick analysis in the TARDIS, and there’s nothing uncommon in its composition.\nMELANIE: Jt wasn’t that clever a suggestion.'*°\nDOCTOR: WHO Do I detect a hint of envy, Mel?\nBANTO: ZAME (Calling back) Hey — what’s that over there? It’s a... oh my stars... look at the size of it!\nMELANIE: It's enormous!\nDOCTOR: WHO What a beauty!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE I’ve never seen one as big as that before!\nDOCTOR: WHO It must take the particular geological extremes at work here to produce a diamond that size.'*’\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE That’s the Treasure then.\nDOCTOR: WHO Just lying here.\nBANTO: ZAME Let's get it and go, shall we then?\nMELANIE: Hold on. No one’s going to leave something as valuable as that lying out in the open and unguarded.'2*\nDOCTOR: WHO xtra Brownie points for Mel. Or should that be Girl Guide points?\nMELANIE: (Laughing) Thank you.\nDOCTOR: WHO So - I shall approach with caution. Stand back, the rest of you.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Ooh, he’s so brave.\nBANTO: ZAME The word I'd choose is ‘stupid’.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE I wish I had a feller like that — not a coward like the one Tm stuck with.\nBANTO: ZAME As if he’d look twice you, my little gargoyle. SALLY-ANNB You what?\nBANTO: ZAME He’s hardly going to throw over a lovely girl like Melanie,\nMELANIE: Stop squabbling. The Doctor's reached the diamond...'?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Calling) It appears to be stuck!\nMELANIE: Give it a tug!\nDOCTOR: WHO I am! It won’t budge!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE screams.\nMELANIE: What is it?\nMELANIE: 114\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Over there -— look!\nBANTO: ZAME Ch no.\nMELANIE: Doctor — behind you! Doctor! SALLY-ANNE It’s like an horrible big... jelly!\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh -— aarggh!!\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE It’s gobbled him up!\nMELANIE: No!

They could\nJELLOID: turn up at any moment.

I just know —- if I go and switch the field off - they'll appear and I'L) have missed them. Then I'll have to call the depot and arrange another delivery date do the whole thing again. And it takes you ages to get through — forty thousand years they put me on hold.\nDOCTOR: WHO But surely you can see our mission is vitally important?’ How long will it take you to switch the field off and come back?\nJELLOID: About ten minutes.\nDOCTOR: Well then. The chances of your goods arriving in that period are infinitesimal.\nJELLOID: Ooh... I just know they will though...\nJELLOID: SALLY-ANNE They won't.\nJELLOID: I bet they will. You go out and they turn up. It always happens.\nJELLOID: SALLY-ANNE Look - we’re here. We promise if they do show up we'll make them wait until you come back.'*\nJELLOID: Hmm... Well...\nJELLOID: SALLY-ANNE Honest\nJELLOID: Oh... all right. But keep a sharp eye out for them.\nDOCTOR: WHO Well done, Sally-Anne. That was very well handled.

This fine gentieman.\nMELANIE: Hey! He’s not the Doctor!\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Too right he’s not.\nCYLINDER: VOICE I wish to reward this... Doctor. Speak!\nPOTIKOL: Yes, Doctor. Go on.\nBANTO: ZAME (in Doctor voice) The task you set me was challenging indeed, I needed all the ingenuity and legerdemain at my disposal. SALLY-ANNE Ooch! And after what he said about you, Doctor!\nBANTO: ZAME A mission fraught with danger, and one for which I will éladly receive any financial reparations you wish to give me. As a Time Lord I have no use for filthy lucre, but on this occasion I think I can force myself to make an exception. I could always give it to charity. Later.\nMELANIE: You can’t let him get away with this, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: WHO Shush, Mel!\nMELANIE: (Sotto) What's up? You look like the cat that got the cream!\nDOCTOR: WHO Just watch...\nCYLINDER: VOICE Very well, Doctor. Raise your hand that I may know you. SALLY-ANNE Oy! Don’t you dare! He’s not the Doctor.\nCYLINDER: VOICE Who is this personage?\nBANTO: ZAME A common space-troll, your eminence. Her mental state is afflicted.\nPOTIKOL: But I thought...\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE Don't worry, Councillor, I’ve got a man who appreciates me now — standing right over there. The Doctor!\nCYLINDER: VOICE What is this? Who is the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: WHO (In cod, Banto Zame-y voice) Not me! The woman's mad.\nCYLINDER: VOICE Then who are you?\nCYLINDER: 124\nDOCTOR: WHO I'm Banto Zame, your honour (with relish) just a two-bit. lying bigamist from the gutters of a superdense mudball. Nobody important.\nBANTO: ZAME Why you... (he stifles his protest)\nCYLINDER: VOICE Then why does the woman say that you are the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: WHO She... er, worships me. Follows me everywhere I go. She’s quite mad. Just as the Doctor said. That Doctor. There.\nCYLINDER: VOICE Himmm... I am suspicious.\nMELANIE: (Worried, sotto) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: WHO Mad, though a lusty wench. No, that’s the Doctor over there. Hang on, look.\nDOCTOR: confiscated from SOKKERY in Part One.\nDOCTOR: WHO There, see? He’s plastered all over the front page of this newspaper. If I just scrape the bile off you can see him...\nCYLINDER: VOICE But still 1 must be certain...\nDOCTOR: WHO And, the Doctor’s a Time Lord, your cylinderness. And a Time Lord would never do this...\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE (Shocked but very pleased) Ooh Doctor!\nMELANIE: (Scandalised) Doctor!\nCYLINDER: VOICE You are right. A Time Lord would never do that!\nBANTO: ZAME Blimey! I mean, indeed. We are above such... things. Now, the reparation you promised...\nCYLINDER: VOICE Very well, Doctor. I shall now reward you.\nBANTO: ZAME What the...? I can’t move.\nBANTO: SALLY-ANNE What’s happening?\nPOTIKOL: Doctor!\nGUARD: He’s caught in some kind of beam, sir.\nPOTIKOL: I can see that! What are you doing to him?\nGYLINDER: VOICE Positive identification obtained. You are the Doctor. Also known as Doctor John Smith; Doctor Johann Schmidt; Doctor von Wer; Theta Sigma; Ka Farag Gatri; Snail...'\"*\nGYLINDER: MEL and DOCTOR WHO hold the following exchange in a whisper.\nMELANIE: (Sotto) 1 get it! The Cylinder wasn’t after the treasure at all... it was after you!\nDOCTOR: WHO (Sotto) Be quiet Mel! I'm Banto Zame, remember? MELANIE And you knew all along?\nDOCTOR: WHO Modesty prevents me from claiming that... but I did work it out a few minutes ago. There are coincidences and coincidences, Mel. Il knew something wasn't right. This whole thing seemed, as you so eloquently put it, ‘fishy’!\nBANTO: ZAME No! Let me go! I’m not the Doctor! It’s him. Over there. Look, if I could point I'd show you...\nCYLINDER: VOICE (Now very stern) You are wanted by my masters, Doctor. The Sussyurats of Chalzon have arraigned you for trial. Too long you have evaded their justice.\nCYLINDER: SALLY-ANNE 1’m not following this at all.\nDOCTOR: WHO The Cylinder set a task it knew only the Doctor could complete.\nDOCTOR: 125\nCYLINDER: VOICE Indeed. My sensors registered newscasts of the Doctor in this system. I tracked him here and now I have him.\nBANTO: ZAME Let me go! Let me go! Please!\nCYLINDER: VOICE No, Doctor. You are coming with me. The journey will be a long one. You will be placed in a time bubble from which even you cannot escape. I am sorry to have troubled you, people of Generios. The loss of your eleventh planet was... regrettable. Goodbye.\nBANTO: ZAME Help! Sally-Anne! Mel! Doctor! Anybody! Help!\nBANTO: ZAME (CONT'D) My wife’s gonna kill me...\nBANTO: space and is gone.\nGUARD: It’s gone.\nPOTIKOL: (Sadly) With the Doctor its only victim. We owe him so much. Again.\nPOTIKOL: again.\nPOTIKOL: GUARD The people are rejoicing, sir!\nPOTIKOL: I must go and address them. Tell them of this terrible blow. Come!\nMELANIE: Poor Banto. Even he didn’t deserve that. (A rueful laugh) ‘You know, he actually proposed to me. SALLY-ANNE He proposes to everyone.\nMELANIE: He told me I was the most beautiful, spirited, intelligent woman... SALLY-ANNE (Joining in) ...spirited, intelligent woman he’d ever met.\nMELANIE: /SALLY-ANNE Eyes like limpid pools, a smile to shame the gods of love...'™\nDOCTOR: WHO Ah - never mind, ladies, Casanova's long gone now. Although I suppose I ought to rescue him from whatever grisly fate these Sussyurats have arranged. I do have a reputation to keep up, after all. SALLY-ANNE Why bother? Good riddance, I reckon. Anyway, I’ve got you now, Doctor. .\nDOCTOR: WHO Ah.'” Sally-Anne. I think I may have given you the wrong impression... faut) 4¥-ANNE Come off it. No man kisses me like that and doesn’t mean it.\nMELANIE: It was all part of the bluff! Isn’t that right, Doctor? SALLY-ANNE Really?\nDOCTOR: WHO (Uncomfortable) Er... well, yes... SALLY-ANNE (Devastated) Oh. Oh well. Suppose I'll just wander down the spaceport, then, catch a shuttle out. Find some other loser to attach myself to. I'm a magnet for losers...!”\nPOTIKOL: Sally-Anne - I have told the crowd of the Doctor’s sacrifice. They wish to see you. my dear. To express their deep sorrow, and their gratitude to you. SALLY-ANNE What? Ooh, really? Oh, hang on though, I suppose it’s the Boron Waa He St\nPOTIKOL: The Doctor couldn't have done it without you, Sally-Anne. ‘Why do you think I... I mean, he has travelling companions? aly\nPOTIKOL: 126\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE So - I was the Doctor’s companion?\nDOCTOR: WHO Yes, Sally-Anne. And you did a fine job. Isn’t that right, Mel?\nMELANIE: Well I... Ckindly)'* yes. Yes of course you did. Couldn’t have done better myself.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE Oh. Oh... cheers. Thanks. You ain't so bad really, you know, ginge.\nMELANIE: Hmm. Thanks, I think.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE And ta for everything, Doctor. I ain't all that keen on this deadly danger bit, but it weren't so bad with a living legend like you around. Come ’ere.\nMELANIE: SALLY-ANNE See you around... sexy!\nDOCTOR: WHO (To himself) Sexy...?\nDOCTOR: POTIKOL The crowd, Sally-Anne?’”\nPOTIKOL: CCONT’D) And there is still the matter of the pluvon power cells.\nPOTIKOL: SALLY-ANNE The what? Oh — oh them.\nPOTIXKOL: I should be able to transfer you the ten million credits later today...\nPOTIXKOL: SALLY-ANNE Ooh! On - that'll do nicely.\nMELANIE: Hmm. You know, that money was swindled out of these people...\nDOCTOR: WHO I think Sally-Anne earned it today, don’t you? Now then — I’ve had quite enough of the vulgar end of time.\nMELANIE: Me too. Hey Doctor - why did those Sussyurats have such a big grudge against you anyway?” They really did go to a lot of trouble to get at you.\nDOCTOR: WHO I've no idea, Mel. I haven't met them yet. When I do, I must be sure to really, really annoy them.\nMELANIE: (Laughs) I suppose we'd better go and rescue poor old Banto then?\nDOCTOR: WHO There's a favour I have to do for the Jelloid first. And of course I was winning a game of Monopoly...\nMELANIE: You are incorrigible!\nDOCTOR: WHO Don’t worry. We'll rescue him, Mel. (Mischievously) In time. But for the moment, I think there’s only room in the universe for the one Doctor. Don’t you?\nDOCTOR: FADE UP CLOSING THEME THE END\nNOTES: 1. Added dialogue before the beginning of Part One —\nANNOUNCER: ‘And now, Colin Baker and Bonnie Langford star in a new adventure spelling double trouble for Doctor Who’ The\nANNOUNCER: is played by sound designer Alistair Lock.\nANNOUNCER: PART ONE\nANNOUNCER: 2. Before his line, DOCTOR WHO laughs maniacally.\nANNOUNCER: 3. This line is repeated.\nANNOUNCER: 4. Deleted dialogue: ‘Knoekedit-with-myohbew?’\nANNOUNCER: 5. MELANIE mispronounces the word ‘Generios’. Then, added dialogue with the correct pronunciation:\nDOCTOR: WHO Generios 1.\nMELANIE: Hm. Generios 1. Gary Russell: ‘Recipe for disaster — put Colin Baker and Bonnie Langford in a recording booth together and then try and get them to do a take in a straightiorward manner! I don’t know who was faughing more in the control room, myself or Alistair, but we could barely concentrate on our jobs and I got told off for being too happy! Bah — I got my revenge when Bonnie stumbled over “Generios” and Calin corrected her. We stilf needed a second take but I made them keep that error in!’\nMELANIE: 6. Line changed to: ‘Pass me my coat, will you?’\nMELANIE: 7. Added dialogue - DOCTOR WHO: ‘Now then... bit tight.’ This is complemented by the sound of DOCTOR WHO putting his coat on.\nMELANIE: 8. ‘TI’ added at the beginning of the line.\nMELANIE: 2. ‘Well, added at the beginning of the line.\nMELANIE: 10. Line changed to: ‘Thank you... but would you mind not dribbling on $e it...’\nMELANIE: 11. Line changed to: ‘Come on, pall’ Gary Russell: ‘Nick Pegg has been @ Big Finish stalwart since the beginning — he wrote, directed and even cropped up in The Spectre of Lanyon Moor and after that a hanaful of other stories featured his dulcet tones. Originally he was going to be Potikol and Steve Fewell was Sokkery but I changed my mind (not sure if either of them knew that!). Nick opted to do an impression of William Hague who, I believe, might have been a famous politician at the time! Hence the “Chum” was replaced with a more Northern-ish “Pal”.’\nMELANIE: 12. Line changed to: ‘Here, you have a drop, pretty lady... anyone ever tell you you've got fantastic ringlets?’\nMELANIE: 13. ‘Well’ added at the beginning of the line.\nMELANIE: 14. Line changed to: ‘So - what happened to these “Skelloids”?’\nMELANIE: 15. Line changed to: ‘I somehow doubt that.’\nMELANIE: 16. ‘Normally, added at the beginning of the line.\nMELANIE: 17. Line changed to: ‘Anyway, Potikol, time’s winged charity Marches on — especially for a Time Lord. Sally-Anne and I really must get back to the STARDIS” For the rest of the script — although they are not annotated - all instances of ‘TARDIST’ are changed to\nMELANIE: 128\nMELANIE: ‘STARDIS'. Gary Russell: ‘TARDIST was an in-joke by Gareth and Clay — it’s from an old TV interview or somesuch I imagine where someone said “TARDIS” wrong. However we realised that TARDIST and TARDIS still sounded tao similar so we opted for STARDIS instead, Banto’s quoting of Andrew Marvell's poem To His Coy Mistress got a bit scrambied on the take (he says “charity” rather than “chariot”) but we all thought it was far more in character for Banto to misquote something he had heard rather than be educated to the Doctor’s level and get the quote right. Another example of Banto not quite being as smart as the Doctor.’\nMELANIE: 18. Line changed to: ‘I will go at once to the Great Bank of Generios and make you out a cheque’\nMELANIE: 19. Line changed to: ‘Everything round here seems to be Great.\nMELANIE: 20. Added dialogue - SOKKERY: ‘Hello’\nMELANIE: 21. Line changed to: ‘Eh up!”\nMELANIE: 22. Line changed to: ‘Yeah, yeah, that’s him, yeah, that’s the\nMELANIE: 23. Line changed to: ‘Not without a pass.’\nMELANIE: 24. No music.\nMELANIE: 28. Line changed to: ‘What, you don’t reckon they’ve rumbled us?’ 26. Line changed to: ‘What — you mean your cash machine’s on the\nMELANIE: 27. Line changed to: ‘I have dispatched a great space dredger to blast it out of the skies’\nMELANIE: 28. Deleted dialogue - GUARD: ‘dast—tey—hep—dewn—heore,_si\nMELANIE: 29. Line changed to: ‘I could do with a glass of water — it would clear my head’\nMELANIE: 30. Line changed to: ‘A great calamity — another great calamity — has befallen us! Inform the council that our great space dredger has been destroyed’\nMELANIE: 31. Line changed to: ‘There’s nothing there.’ Gary Russell: ‘Sally-Anne was written as a.pure Coronation Street-style teenager, but jason and I wanted to get Clare Buckfieid in for this one, who isn’t Northern at all. Thus odd terms and phrases throughout the script became more “Saarf London, innit”. fason had met Clare before but I only knew her through 2 Point 4 Children which, whilst not my favourite sitcom ever, did feature four amazing lead actors as the main family so ! was overjoyed to meet her. Fab lady, completely unfazed by being a mega TV star. It also took me ages to realise that her boyfriend, “Dec, who she talked about was in the fact the one who isn’t Ant in “Ant and. When she eventually introduced me to him a few months later, I immediately tried to get him interested in doing a Docter Who, along with Mr McPhelin, but alas neither of them are really Who aficionados and Dec said no. Bah humbug! Stick him in a snake-infested jungle, t say!’\nMELANIE: 32. Line changed to: ‘But this is my system, I've been working West Galaxy a long time, twenty-five years in the business.’\nMELANIE: $3. Line changed to: ‘Here, you get your hands off my chest!’\nMELANIE: 34. Added dialogue - [2ND] GUARD: ‘Yes sir!’. [2ND] GUARD, who does not appear in the script, was played by Alistair Lock.\nMELANIE: 129\nMELANIE: 35. Line replaced by - [@ND] GUARD: ‘Right away, sir!’\nMELANIE: 36. Underneath this line, added dialogue - BANTO ZAME: ‘Bye, bye. Give them an autographed picture. Gary Russell: ‘It took Chris Biggins ail of thirty seconds to realise that every ad lib Colin could do, he'd do one too. it became a contest I think! The one under this line about getting an autograph was undoubtedly one of the best. Gareth and Clay wrote Banto for Chris Biggins right from the word go. There simply wasn’t anyone else in their minds. Through Stephen Fewell (he and Chris had been in an Oscar Wilde play together) Gareth put the idea to him, which I then followed up. Many years ago I'd worked with Chris ona schools TV show we did where he was the baddie and we bonded, as did all the cast, over a mutual loathing for a member of the production team. it was nice to see him fifteen or so years later and realise he still remembered! The man is adorable and I’d love to hear more from Banto one day.’\nMELANIE: 37. Line changed to: ‘That object has destroyed our great space dredger - and now it’s heading straight for us!’\nMELANIE: 38. Line changed to: “Yes, very, very good, Potikol, I get it.’\nMELANIE: 39. Added dialogue - DOCTOR WHO: ‘Charming!’\nMELANIE: 40. Added dialogue - (2ND] GUARD: ‘Right.’ Gary Russell: ‘in post- production Alistair realised that the same guard as earlier (played by stalwart Mark Wright) couldn't conceivably do everything, so he replaced one or two of Mark’ lines with his own voice and added in a few more fines as well. Never misses an opportunity, does Ali.’\nMELANIE: 41. ‘Right, added at the beginning of the line. Then, added dialogue — [2ND] GUARD: ‘Oh, yes’\nMELANIE: 42. Line changed to: ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes, you're right...\"\nMELANIE: 43. Line changed to: ‘Concentrate, Mel, concentrate.’\nMELANIE: 44. SOKKERY’s entire dialogue in this scene was changed to: ‘Whassat? Whassat thing? It’s huger than the sky! It’s blotting everything out! Oh, and we were having such a laugh as well. Eh, do you mind keeping the noise down up there? There’s people down here trying to have a party. (Burps) Sorry. Look at the size of it! It’s enormous!’ Gary Russell: ‘Talking of never missing an opportunity ~ here’s Mr Pegg taking a couple of liberties with what's scripted. “Look at the size of it” indeed!’\nMELANIE: 48. Line changed to: ‘It’s right over the city!’\nMELANIE: PaRT Two\nMELANIE: ’ 46. This scene does not appear in Part Two. Gary Russell: ‘This scene isn't in the final version, I honestly have no idea why not. Probably time, or maybe Alistair felt it interrupted the flow of the climactic end to Part One. He was probably right. Probably,’ 47. Line changed to: ‘I thought for a moment there —’' 48. Rather than CYLINDER VOICE’s line being in the background, it is intercut with DOCTOR WHO's line:\nCYLINDER: VOICE These must be presented to me in good repair.\nDOCTOR: WHO Incredible.\nDOCTOR: 130\nCYLINDER: VOICE You will bring them to me and I will analyse them in order to assess their value.\nDOCTOR: WHO it must be transmitting to the entire planet.\nCYLINDER: VOICE Failure to do so will result in immediate death for your peoples.\nCYLINDER: 49. As indicated, this line does not appear in this scene.\nCYLINDER: 80. On the director’s copy of the script, the pronunciation of\nCYLINDER: ‘gluarb’ is phonetically specified as ‘gloo-arb’.\nCYLINDER: §1. Line changed to: ‘The second thing?’\nCYLINDER: S82. Line changed to: ‘Come on, the Great Council Chamber’\nCYLINDER: S83. Added dialogue:\nMELANIE: No, he’s not.\nDOCTOR: WHO No.\nDOCTOR: 84. Line changed to:\nPOTIKOL: Oh goodness — not these idiots again. Guards. [2ND] GUARD Yes, sir!\nPOTIKOL: Throw them out - into the streets this time!\nPOTIKOL: [2ND]GUARD Right!\nDOCTOR: WHO What?\nPOTIKOL: I must go to the people and try to calm them! Good luck Doctor - the future of Generios is in your hands, again! 85. Added dialogue - [2ND} GUARD: ‘Yes!’ 86. Line changed to: ‘Oh, sorry, did someone say something?’ 87. Line changed to: ‘What business is that of yours?’ 58. Line changed to: ‘Fek! Everybody knows that!’ 59. Line changed to: ‘That’s a... well, a... (signs) it's a portaloo’” 60. BANTO ZAME and DOCTOR WHO both have two extra ‘Yes’s. 61. Line changed to: ‘Lest any should doubt the seriousness of my intention, I shall now destroy the eleventh planet of this system!’ 62. Deleted dialogue — POTIKOL: ‘fheyve-doneinside’ 63. Added dialogue - DOCTOR WHO: ‘What?’ 64. BANTO ZAME says an extra, ‘Oh dear. 65. BANTO ZAMBE says an extra, ‘Oh dear’ 66. Added dialogue: SALLY-ANNE Oh.\nDOCTOR: WHO Thank you. 67. Line changed to: ‘“Not that far off...” no, no, no. 68. Line changed to: ‘Infaet—Mel, as time is rather against us...’ 69. Added dialogue — SALLY-ANNE: ‘Yeah’ 70. Line changed to: ‘So, Melanie - how did you pal up with that Doctor in the first place, then?’ 71. Line changed to: ‘Don’t go boasting about that, people will think we’re strange.’ 72. Line changed to: ‘Now, we’ve got to find Unit 2X419. Whatever that is.’ 73. Line changed to: ‘Whatever it was, it came from that ruin there on the horizon’\nDOCTOR: 131\nDOCTOR: 74. Line changed to: ‘Look, look again’ 78. Line changed to: ‘“Unit EM670. This light, attractive, interlocking, easy-to-assemble anglepoise lighting feature is available in both burnt ochre and aqua marine blue finish. Whether you're working or just relaxing, it provides a reassuring glow to relieve the pointless and arbitrary existence of the human being”’ 76. This line is said under the preceding line. 77. Under this line, BANTO ZAME says, ‘Ohno. %8. Line changed to, ‘It was incredibly successful — supplied the whole world, and far beyond. %9. Line changed to: SALLY-ANNE A what-theatre?\nDOCTOR: WHO Oh, never mind.\nDOCTOR: 80. This line and the preceding line was changed to:\nDOCTOR: WHO Here we go.\nDOCTOR: SALLY-ANNE Careful! ¥euve-ripped-myskint!\nDOCTOR: WHO Sorry. Shhh!\nDOCTOR: 81. ‘Leok, added at the beginning of the line."
