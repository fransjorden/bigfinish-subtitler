For too many years, our fleet drifted through space, where hope is coldest and despair best fits. But deliverance came in an unexpected form, when a blue box materialised onboard The Duke of Milan. That is why today, this day of days, we honour those who set us on a true course, the Doctor and Mel!\nGONZALO: Not only did they find a new world for us to inhabit, but one containing a new and sustainable source of energy. And when paradise seemed within our grasp, we came to realise that this unnamed world was already inhabited, by the subterranean race we now know are called the Mogera. Once again, the Doctor came to our aid. In honour of our new-found co-operation, the Mogera and I have agreed to bestow upon this planet the name “Prosper.” What’s past is prologue, the seeds of time have this day been planted!\nGONZALO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 3\nGONZALO: SCENE 2: INT.

This ceremony is being simulcast to every one of them.\nDOCTOR: No need to stand on ceremony for us, you know.\nMEL: He doesn’t usually like to hang around for the celebrations after the job’s done. Personally, I love it.\nDOCTOR: It was mostly good luck, you know.\nMEL: Luck, and a decent collection of maps from the TARDIS’ interstellar cartography room.\nDOCTOR: I really don’t understand the need for all this ceremony.\nMEL: (HUSHED) Quiet, Doctor! Why can’t you just learn to accept what you deserve?\nGONZALO: I have in my hand a piece of paper...\nDOCTOR: Ah, that brings back memories.\nGONZALO: . a pact between our race and the Mogera.

I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well, I’m sure that wasn’t important. — So what story were you telling, Mel? The were-tarantulas of Vyga 3?\nMEL: I was telling Ace about the treaty between the human colonists and the Mogera on Prosper.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s a good one, too.\nACE: The Doctor’s story sounded better.\nMEL: I thought you might prefer to hear about a time when nobody died and nothing exploded.\nACE: You don’t really know me at all, do you?\nDOCTOR: What on Earth made you think of that, Mel?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 9\nMEL: Because you said we were headed back there!\nDOCTOR: Did I? Does that sound like the sort of thing I’d be likely to say?\nACE: You said it was one of your items on your bucket list.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, there it is, just after “duet with Frank Sinatra”.\nACE: Which you did last week.\nMEL: We were lucky to get out of that one with our lives.\nDOCTOR: Yes, he wasn’t as good a sport as I’d hoped.\nMEL: Well, he did like to do things his way.\nDOCTOR: I should probably cross off “host a game show” and “find out what happened to the dinosaurs”.\nDOCTOR: And I might save “box with Joe Frazier” for a later incarnation.\nACE: But, look, we are actually going to this place- what’d you say it was called again?\nMEL: Ace, weren’t you listening either?\nACE: Not really.

But it turned out there was a problem.\nACE: Someone else was already living there — the Mogera, right?\nDOCTOR: Whose territory just happened to be on top of the largest source of Doctorium on the planet.\nMEL: Obviously, it wasn’t called that before the Doctor discovered Tes\nDOCTOR: That would have been something of a coincidence.\nACE: I do know this story. Loads like it, anyway. The natives have something, the settlers want it, and they’1l kill as many natives as they like to get their hands on it.\nDOCTOR: Except that on this occasion, we were able to reach an accord before a single shot was fired.\nMEL: Believe me, Ace, it would’ve been a bloodbath — the Mogera weren’t exactly equipped for fighting.

You’re never tardy in a TARDIS, that’s what I always say.\nMEL: I have literally never heard you say that.\nACE: Me neither.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’re not always here. I might’ve said it to Polly, or Tegan, or Sharon...\nMEL: You’ve never mentioned a Sharon before.\nDOCTOR: Everyone has at least one Sharon in their life.\nMEL: I think he might have a point there.\nDOCTOR: And I think we’1ll find both humans and Mogera are enjoying a golden age- (TRAILS OFF AS HE SEES OUTSIDE)\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8: EXT.

These must be the colony ships. They just landed them here and turned them into cities.\nACE: Except there’s no “they.” I don’t see or hear anyone. And no birds.\nDOCTOR: There weren’t any in the first place.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 15\nMEL: Doctor — this isn’t because of anything we did... is it?\nDOCTOR: I’m asking myself the same question.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: SCENE 9: INT.

You’re needed back at The Duke.\nMEL: The Duke?\nMIRANDA: The Duke of Milan — our headquarters.\nMEL: Why are you still using your old ships? Why haven’t you built anything?\nMIRANDA: We’ve been a little busy, Mel. It is Mel, isn’t it?\nMEL: Yes.\nMIRANDA: They said you were time-travellers. I don’t think I ever believed it. It’s not usually nice, being wrong — today, I’m glad I was.\nDOCTOR: Happy to be of assistance.\nMIRANDA: Driver, contact The Duke, tell them we’ve picked up our visitors, and that apparently there’s a third, still wandering the streets.\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: Please! We need our friend.\nMIRANDA: Forgive me, Doctor, but the Minister of Fate needs you more.\nMEL: Minister of Fate? Is that another ship?\nDOCTOR: I hope so, Mel, because otherwise it sounds quite ominous.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12: EXT. STREETS OF PROSPER\nACE: Doctor? Mel? What happened? Where’d you go?\nACE: Anyone about? Great!\nACE: Anybody in there? You decent? Hello? Hello! Look, have gone now, it’s safe to let me in. I’m- nice. probably talking to myself.\nACE: Page 22\nACE: those things And I’m\nACE: EARLIER.\nACE: Uh-oh. I know that noise. Not hanging round this time! Which\nACE: way’s the TARDIS?\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 23\nACE: SCENE 13: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — LABS\nOPERATING: MACHINERY.\nJUNO: Miranda, everyone here on The Duke's talking about the Doctor. It’s not true, is it?\nMIRANDA: (D; OVER RADIO) He’s sitting right next to me right now, Juno. Is that true enough for you?\nJUNO: The actual Doctor, with the hat and the umbrella?\nMIRANDA: (D) Believe me, I’m finding it hard enough to believe and I’m actually looking at him.\nJUNO: There goes my paper on the impossibility of time travel.\nMIRANDA: (D) When would you have got around to writing it?\nJUNO: Good point. And what about the other one, Mel?\nMIRANDA: (D) She’s here, too. And apparently there’s another one, a female.\nMEL: (D; OFF) Her name is Ace!\nMIRANDA: She’s lost in Sector Fourteen.\nJUNO: (D) Is she, now? That’s not good. Do you think they know how not good it is?\nMIRANDA: (D) If they didn’t before, they do now.\nJUNO: No room for tact in science. When you get back here, bring them down to the lab. I want to see the legendary Doctor for myself.\nMIRANDA: (D) Attending.\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 24\nJUNO: (A LONG, DEEP SIGH) Doctor...\nJUNO: FLOORS, LIKE ALL OTHER LOCATIONS ON THE DUKE).\nJUNO: (DEPARTING) Nobody touch anything on my workstation, I'll be right back!\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 25\nJUNO: SCENE 14: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR.\nJUNO: HE’S STILL RECOGNIZABLY A MOGERA.\nCALIBAN: All Burrow-Brothers, take heed! A stranger wanders the streets of the human district — she is not of The Duke of Milan, her clothing and her ways are different. Her presence on our world is a sign! She must be brought to me! Our destiny depends upon it! The brave warrior who brings her here will have earned himself a promotion — away from the main battle!\nMOGERAS: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 26\nMOGERAS: SCENE 15: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — ENTRY BAY.\nMOGERAS: APPROACHES.\nALONSO: (APPROACHING) Miranda! Juno told me everything!\nMIRANDA: Hard to believe, I know. But here’s the proof.\nMEL: I think they’re talking about us, Doctor.\nALONSO: Indeed I am, child!\nDOCTOR: The Minister of Fate, I presume?\nALONSO: Alonso, please! The Doctor and Mel. Well. The statues don’t do either of you justice.\nMEL: There are statues?\nALONSO: There were statues. I think we may still have some pictures of them, but I’m afraid nostalgia hasn’t really been a priority. As I’m sure you gathered, we don’t have a great deal of time for reminiscing.\nMIRANDA: Or much of anything, apart from surviving.\nALONSO: Miranda, child, I’ve noticed that your driver Adrian has worked four consecutive tours. Go after him and tell him he’s excused the next two tours, would you?\nMIRANDA: Attending.\nDOCTOR: Mr Alonso — Minister — we have a friend, who- Forgive me, have we met?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 27\nALONSO: Had I been so honoured, Doctor, I would surely have remembered LE.\nMEL: I recognised you straight away! The features, the voice - even the ruff could be the same. You look just like Gonzalo - captain of The Duke of Milan!\nALONSO: My illustrious ancestor. The man who helped turn Prosper from an optimistic dream into a paradise.\nMEL: Except it didn’t stay a paradise, did it?\nALONSO: About eight months. But it was a glorious eight months, by all accounts.\nDOCTOR: Is that when they invaded?\nALONSO: Invaded?\nDOCTOR: Those creatures we saw — those armour-plated trolls.\nMEL: Ogres.\nDOCTOR: Ogres.\nMEL: We've seen them, Alonso. They almost tore our friend to pieces with those massive claws.\nALONSO: You baffle me, both of you. Prosper hasn’t been invaded.\nMEL: But we thought the only intelligent beings native to this planet were the Mogera.\nALONSO: And you thought correctly.\nMEL: Well?\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 28\nALONSO: Those creatures who attacked you out on the streets were the\nALONSO: Mogera.\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 29\nALONSO: SCENE 16: EXT. STREETS OF PROSPER\nACE: The TARDIS! There you are..! (FX: STOPS RUNNING) You, my friend, are the most beautiful thing I’ve seen since Teen Beat printed that picture of Johnny Chess with his shirt off- No, forget that, you’re just the most beautiful, the most fabulous, the most welcoming...\nACE: Uh... At least you would be, if I hadn’t left my key inside!\nACE: Aw, come on! (DRAWS BREATH) OK... Look: the Doctor’s always saying you’re more than just a machine, that you’re a living thing? So, you know me, right? We’ve been around each other for a while now. So why not just let me in? Hm? C’mon. Show me some love.\nWHEN: IT DOESN’T WORK.\nACE: You’ve always hated me, haven’t you? Admit it! Mel’s your favourite, I know, I can tell! I bet she could just snap her fingers, and you’d let her walk right in, wouldn’t you? Well, that’s just fine!\nACE: I’1ll catch up with the Doctor. Even if I have to- run.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 30\nACE: SCENE 17: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — BRIDGE\nALONSO: Ace? Our histories don’t include mention of an Ace. Is shea new addition to your crew?\nMEL: Actually, I am. It’s complicated.\nALONSO: Time out of joint, eh? You don’t have to explain.\nMEL: Oh, thank goodness.\nALONSO: I’ll see if anyone can be spared to look for your friend. In the meantime, there’s much to discuss.\nDOCTOR: There certainly is. How did all this happen, Alonso?\nMEL: And when?\nALONSO: Now, I don’t want you to blame yourselves, either of you. It’s not entirely your fault.\nMEL: Our fault?\nALONSO: We had no reason to believe the Doctorium was at all harmful. It certainly had no effect on human physiology.\nDOCTOR: The Doctorium...?\nALONSO: It altered the Mogera — physically and mentally. They became much, much larger, pathologically aggressive. This all came to pass not long after you abandoned us.\nMEL: We didn’t really think of it as abandoning you.\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 31\nALONSO: Nevertheless, for the last hundred years, the Mogera have been raiding our territory, killing our people and stealing our technology.\nDOCTOR: And the metal from your ships — I assume that’s what they fashion their armour from.\nALONSO: Quite correct. Apart from anything else, it’s extremely ill- mannered.\nMEL: But why are they doing it?\nALONSO: You'd have to ask Caliban, their leader. But I couldn’t in all good conscience, recommend that you do so. He’s rather angry with you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Alonso, I ran tests on the Doctorium, I was sure it was safe-\nALONSO: Yes, yes. That’s all in the past. And what’s past is prologue.\nDOCTOR: So I hear.\nALONSO: Now you’ve returned to us, an entirely new volume in Prosper’s history is about to be written, just as we thought we’d almost reached the end of the tale.\nMEL: Things are really that bad, then?\nALONSO: My dear Mel, another year, and there won’t be enough of us left to make a human settlement on this world sustainable. Most of the survivors are here, in The Duke — there are still a few scattered bands of people out there. We try to protect them as best we can, but...\nMEL: I can’t believe the Mogera are capable of doing something like that.\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 32\nALONSO: But you saw it with your own eyes. The Duke of Milan's super- thick hull protects most of the survivors, but we can’t last much longer. And though it pains me to inform you, it’s almost certain that the girl Ace is dead also.\nMEL: No!\nALONSO: Hell is empty, Doctor, and all the devils are here.\nDOCTOR: And it seems I created those devils.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18: EXT. STREETS OF PROSPER\nACE: (OFF-MIC) Hey, you! Any shelter round here?\nSTEPHANO: (HOARSE) Get away!\nACE: (OFF-MIC) What?\nSTEPHANO: (HOARSE) Get away from here! Get aw-\nACE: (OFF-MIC) Hey!\nACE: It’s all right, I’m here.\nSTEPHANO: Noooo... (HE SOBS) Why couldn’t you leave me alone? Now we’re both dead!\nSTEPHANO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 34\nSTEPHANO: SCENE 19: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — BRIDGE\nCALIBAN: (D) Our Burrow-Fathers were duped! Duped by the humans, duped by the being known as the Doctor! He tricked us into mining for his precious Doctorium, knowing it would poison us, knowing it would make us into monsters! Knowing that-\nALONSO: Pause it.\nALONSO: Scurvy monster, this Caliban, isn’t he?\nMEL: Terrifying!\nALONSO: He’s the Mogera’s equivalent of a war hero. But one man’s terrorist, you know...\nJUNO: Minister, I thought you ought to know our last attempts to block Setebos were unsuccessful, I’m afraid. Somehow he’s managed to hack his way back in.\nALONSO: The Devil take his fingers!\nMEL: Who’s Setebos?\nALONSO: A minor irritation, no more than a distraction for our Chief Mage here. Oh, Juno here is head of the League of Technogicians. Juno, the Doctor and Mel.\nDOCTOR: Delighted. You’re some sort of scientific adviser, I take it?\nJUNO: I do more than advise, Doctor. It’s my job to find new ways of dealing with the mess you left us in a century ago.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 35\nALONSO: I was just showing our guests footage of the self-styled “General” Caliban.\nMEL: I was just wondering, why does he have that thing on his neck?\nJUNO: Voice synthesizer of some sort. He was wounded by our troops shortly before he rose to power about, um, fifteen years ago. (A BEAT) Thereabouts. To him, the synthesizer’s a symbol of our human cruelty.\nALONSO: As is everything about the Mogera, particularly their strength and aggression.\nDOCTOR: Because I persuaded them to mine the Doctorium.\nJUNO: Which transformed them into the thing they hate the most. Although they also hate us for making them hate themselves.\nALONSO: Succinctly put, Juno.\nMEL: I’m sorry, but they can’t be the same creatures, they just can’t!\nJUNO: Look at this.\nJUNO: That’s a Mogera, taken shortly after the colony ships arrived.\nMEL: Awww...\nJUNO: And this is one of the few images we’ve been able to get of them as they are now. You see? Teeth become fangs, nails become talons. The only thing that hasn’t increased, apparently, is their brain capacity, which is capable of processing only resentment.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose anybody’s tried negotiation?\nALONSO: The one person who did took that picture - moments before his flesh was shredded by the claws of the Mogera. Since then, we've relied on the League of Technogicians to provide us with effective weaponry.\nJUNO: Not simply weaponry, but tracking systems, too. It’s hard to predict where your enemy will strike when they travel at speed underground.\nMEL: We saw three of them claw their way to the surface, just before a storm whipped up, and then Miranda appeared and scared them off with- well, it sort of looked like a wizard’s stick.\nJUNO: One of these, you mean? Catch.\nMEL: It is a wizard’s stick!\nDOCTOR: The staff’s powered by Doctorium, I take it?\nJUNO: Fresh cells go in here, you see?\nDOCTOR: And with this you can manipulate climactic conditions?\nALONSO: On a very small scale, yes.\nDOCTOR: Small?\nJUNO: And over a very short range. The Mogera retain an inbred fear of extreme weather. But it’s no more than a defensive measure — eventually, they’1l overcome it and gradually slash their way in here.\nDOCTOR: How many have died?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 37\nJUNO: Excuse me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: How many people have died since the Mogera mutated?\nALONSO: I don’t know that records are kept any more, but... several million.\nMEL: Million...!\nJUNO: Including my daughter.\nDOCTOR: Juno, I’m so sorry.\nJUNO: Don’t be. I, for one, am very grateful for the opportunity to thank you in person, Doctor, for everything you’ve done for us.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 38\nJUNO: SCENE 20: EXT. STREETS OF PROSPER\nACE: You still with me, mate? Come back to me.\nACE: They did this to you, those hairy things in the armour, they tore you up like this? Is your home anywhere round here?\nSTEPHANO: Home...\nACE: Yeah, home, you know?\nSTEPHANO: Family.\nACE: Family, that’s right. I’m going to get you back to your family. What’s your name?\nSTEPHANO: Stephano.\nACE: Alright, Stephano, we’re getting out of here — so long as you can tell me where we go.\nSTEPHANO: My family...\nACE: You’re going to see your family soon enough.\nSTEPHANO: I think so, too. (SPLUTTERS) Take this.\nACE: What is it, some sort of gun?\nSTEPHANO: Take it.\nACE: I dunno, I have a friend who sort of has a thing against guns.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 39\nSTEPHANO: Take — it!\nSTEPHANO: UNDERGROUND, AS HEARD EARLIER.\nACE: Fine, fine, I’1ll take it. Now do you think you can walk? Stephano? Take my hand, let me help you up. Come on, come on, open your eyes!\nACE: Open your eyes! (REALISATION; HE’S DEAD) Damn. I’m sorry, Stephano. I’m so... sorry.\nACE: SURFACE.\nACE: Not again! Stay back! I’ve got a gun, and I’m not afraid to use at!\nACE: All right, I am sort of afraid to use it, but I’1ll still use it, so back off, OK?\nACE: I warned you!\nACE: A REGULAR GUN. THE FOUR PROJECTILES FLY FROM THE WEAPON AND\nSPLAT: AGAINST TALPA LIKE PELLETS FROM A PAINT GUN.\nACE: Oh, no way! I hit you every time! Not fair!

Of course it’s about Ace!\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 49\nMIRANDA: You’re can’t face what’s out there alone, Mel, and no-one else can be spared.\nMEL: So I’m told. But you don’t seem to be doing anything.\nMIRANDA: Except trying to protect you. Even this close to The Duke, we're not safe. Come back inside.\nMEL: When I come back inside, it’1ll be with Ace. And before you say it, yes, I’m sure you’ve lost far more people than I have or ever will, but you must understand what it means to want to keep someone safe.\nMIRANDA: You’re going to get us both killed, you know that, don’t you?\nMIRANDA: THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN.\nMEL: Thank you.\nMIRANDA: Thank me when we come back alive. If we come back.\nMEL: Miranda, what’s that? Is it the Mogera?\nMIRANDA: Mogera don’t need vehicles, they travel underground. It’s one of ours! No-one should be out at this time!\nMEL: It’s covered in claw marks!\nMIRANDA: And it’s not slowing down! — Mel, get out of the way!\nMIRANDA: CRUNCH.\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 50\nMIRANDA: SCENE 26: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — LAB\nJUNO: I wanted you to join me in the lab, Doctor, because I think you should see just how dire our present situation is.\nSLIDES: OPEN.\nDOCTOR: This is all there is?\nJUNO: These tanks represent our last reserves of Doctorium.\nDOCTOR: Whenever I hear that name, it’s like a knife through each of my hearts.\nJUNO: And an even bigger one through your ego, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: But surely this can’t be the last of it, Juno.\nJUNO: All that’s available to us. There are seams in our territory, but mining them is suicidally dangerous when you have a subterranean enemy.\nJUNO: Now what?\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 51\nJUNO: SCENE 27: EXT. IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE DUKE OF MILAN.\nMIRANDA: Mel, are you all right?\nMEL: Thanks to you. Who was driving that thing?\nMIRANDA: That’s what I’d like to know! (COUGHS) Come on, whoever it is, we've got to get them out of there!\nMEL: Careful, Miranda, it might- (COUGH) It might explode!\nMIRANDA: I think the worst has already happened.\nMEL: (SEES WHO’S INSIDE) Alonso!\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Mel, Mel, are you safe?\nMEL: We both are, but I don’t know if we can say the same about the driver.\nJUNO: Minister!\nMIRANDA: Someone help me get him out of there! And be careful with him — we don’t know the extent of his injuries.\nMEL: He’s still breathing, he’s just unconscious.\nDOCTOR: Not precisely, Mel. I think he’s asleep.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: EXT. WASTES OF PROSPER\nACE: You should know, that man we left back there — the one your mates ripped to shreds. Before he died, he told me his name.\nTALPA: Mm?\nACE: Stephano.\nTALPA: Humans all have funny names.\nACE: He had a family. Don’t you want to know if I have a family?\nTALPA: I’m not even really interested whether or not you have a name.\nACE: I do. It’s Ace.\nTALPA: Well, Ace, it’s going to be a long journey, since you lot can’t breathe underground.\nACE: Not easily, anyway.\nTALPA: So I’d appreciate a little quiet.\nACE: Well, that’s too bad, because I’d really like us to get to know each other.\nTALPA: You want me to feel bad about killing you?\nACE: Killing me? You said you were going to hand me over to some General.\nTALPA: I might not be able to stop myself.\nACE: I thought you were cured of the ‘roid rage.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 53\nTALPA: You saw other Mogera.\nACE: Just after I got here. If they’re what pass for tourist guides on Prosper, your customer service skills need a bit of work.\nTALPA: Were they wearing bandoliers?\nACE: Like a belt across their chest? Yeah. What’s that for, spare ammo?\nTALPA: It stores the vaccine we take when we’re away from the burrows. Four ampoules a day: a green one first, then three yellow ones during the day.\nACE: So why don’t you have one of these belts?\nTALPA: I lost it in a- skirmish.\nACE: Yeah, I’ve seen what happens to people who get caught in one of your “skirmishes.” But you’re fine now, right?\nTALPA: Only because you gave me a massive dose. When it’s run its course, I’ll revert. This time, there’1ll be no coming back for me. I’11 kill anything that moves.\nACE: Let me know when it’s happening, so I’11 know not to move.\nTALPA: If it helps at all-\nACE: It won’t.\nTALPA: The alien I was actually hoping to kill was the one who did this to us — a being called the Doctor.\nACE: What?\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 54\nACE: SCENE 29: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — INFIRMARY\nALONSO: It’s all rather embarrassing, really.\nJUNO: The physician tells me you managed to avoid breaking a single bone.\nDOCTOR: I should call it little short of miraculous.\nMIRANDA: What did you think you were doing out there?\nALONSO: The Doctor and Mel’s friend is on the streets somewhere. I was the only non-essential person available to look for her.\nJUNO: Since when is the Minister of Fate non-essential?\nALONSO: There’1l always be another, child.\nMIRANDA: Forgive me, but it was damn foolish.\nJUNO: Especially since the girl is almost certainly dead. Statistically speaking.\nMEL: I don’t give a damn what your statistics say!\nDOCTOR: Mel, please. Alonso, I take it you didn’t see a trace of her?\nALONSO: I’m so sorry, Doctor. I was on my way back here to inform you, when my eyes grew wondrous heavy... I felt a good dullness, and I must have dozed off moments before the crash.\nJUNO: Your state of total relaxation saved your life.\nDOCTOR: One sees it in drunks and babies — not to imply that you’re either, of course.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 55\nALONSO: No, Doctor, I’m an old man — be not disturbed with my infirmity. But it seems for once, my advancing years have been of some use.\nMEL: Not in finding Ace, they haven’t. Come on, Miranda.\nMIRANDA: I’m sorry, Mel, we've left it far too late. There’s no way I can permit anyone to leave The Duke.\nMEL: Oh, I don’t believe this!\nMIRANDA: Mel!\nALONSO: Go after her, child.\nMIRANDA: Attending.\nALONSO: Doctor, Juno’s probably told you already, I- I need you to do something for us.\nDOCTOR: If it’s to help you destroy the Mogera, Alonso, that’s something I can’t agree to.\nALONSO: Not that, never that. Just... find a way to bring this madness, this violence, to an end. Juno will work with you.\nJUNO: Oh, will she?\nALONSO: I accepted the title of Minister of Fate so many years ago because I wanted to carry on the work of my ancestors. Now I Simply want to put a stop to the killing. And I have no idea how to do that.\nDOCTOR: I’m responsible for everything that’s happened here.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 56\nJUNO: Agreed.\nDOCTOR: How can I do anything else but help you and the Mogera?\nALONSO: Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I ask.\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 57\nALONSO: SCENE 30: EXT. WASTES OF PROSPER\nALONSO: FEET.\nACE: It’s tiring, all this walking. Don’t you find it tiring? (NO REPLY) ‘Cos I do. (PAUSE) This is actually a pretty nice planet you’ve got here. A bit bleak, but I’ve seen a lot worse.\nACE: Lovely sky. I like a nice sky, me. Just the right number of suns. Oh, look if we’re gonna talk, I’ve got to know your name.\nTALPA: Then we just won’t talk.\nACE: What’s your name?\nTALPA: (AFTER A PAUSE) Talpa.\nACE: OK, Talpa, I’m tired. I don’t have the legs of a massive, armour-plated rage-monster. I’m a human being, and I’m knackered.\nTALPA: Fine! (FX: HE STOPS ABRUPTLY, AS DOES ACE) We stop here for the night.\nACE: Is there any food? Every two or three days, I get hungry.\nTALPA: Survival rations.\nACE: Do they taste as good as they look? (WITH A FULL MOUTH) Sadly, yeah, they do.\nTALPA: Anything else wrong?\nTALPA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 58\nACE: I could be warmer.\nTALPA: Then allow me.\nACE: Hey!\nTRANSPORT: ENGINES AND MIRANDA’S STAFF. FLAMES CRACKLE.\nTALPA: Tree stump’1l burn for hours.\nACE: Does your gun need to be that massive, or are you just making up for something?\nTALPA: It’s based on human technology, you tell me. And like every piece of technology on Prosper, it’s powered by Doctorium.\nACE: I thought you said that stuff was poisoning you. Why do you use it in all your weapons? Seems barmy to me.\nTALPA: Once the last of the humans are gone from this world, we’1ll block up the mines for good.\nACE: You know you could do that right now?\nTALPA: Not until we’ve taken vengeance on the ones who did this to us.\nACE: It wasn’t on purpose!\nTALPA: Your own people say it was!\nACE: Who? Who says that?\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 59\nACE: SCENE 31: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — LAB\nACE: DISTORTION AND INTERFERENCE.\nSETEBOS: How does one even put into words the method by which it is possible to overthrow those who have lied to us, held us in contempt, kept us in virtual slavery for generations? I speak in particular here of The Minister of Fate himself, he is the loathsome canker that lives in the sweetest bud. It is here already, my friends: Total martial law, total surveillance, total taxation, a revolution of criminality, and we have reached the key point where we have become acclimated to it. Let every eye negotiate for itself! It has emerged, and once the Mogera, the demons we have made, have been exterminated, the final phase is total domination, oh yes. Make no mistake, Prosper is a world of deceit and we have lost too many to this manufactured slaughter! [FROM THIS POINT ON, JUNO AND THE\nDOCTOR: TALK OVER HIS SPEECH WHICH CONTINUES AS FOLLOWS: I Say, let grief convert to anger! Blunt not the heart, enrage it! We have all become comfortable living under the heel of tyranny. I grant our Minister bloody, luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, malicious, smacking of every sin that has a name. The answer to defeating him and his pernicious League of Technogicians is to withdraw our consent at every level. Expose the system as fraudulent, don’t let these degenerate cultural oxymorons possess the power that rightfully belongs to you, the people. We will never back down! They are bringing us into bondage with huge chains, forged for us and our children, smiling at us all the time!]\nJUNO: Setebos. If you really want to be of any use, Doctor, you can find a way to shut him up.\nDOCTOR: Setebos — I believe I’ve heard that name before.\nJUNO: He’s a buffoon, a mutineer, constantly spouting nonsense about how we intentionally infected the Mogera with Doctorium as part of some open-eyed conspiracy that changes from week-to-week.\nDOCTOR: I’d be happy to assure him that wasn’t the case.\nJUNO: If you can find him. He’s somehow able to jump onto our frequencies and broadcast his deluded rambling to all our devices — possibly the Mogera’s too, for all I know. Audio only - he’s too much of a coward to show his face.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: And you can’t trace them back to the source?\nJUNO: If I could find him, I’d offer him a position with the League — once I’d finished supplanting some of his teeth.\nDOCTOR: Mel has a particular aptitude with computers, perhaps you should speak to her.\nJUNO: Always keen to dodge responsibility, aren’t you, Doctor? Is that the secret of your success?\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t categorise what’s happened on Prosper a success.\nJUNO: Then we agree on something.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 61\nJUNO: SCENE 32: EXT. WASTES OF PROSPER\nSETEBOS: (D) They are bringing us into bondage with huge chains, forged for us and our children, smiling at us all the time! Now you understand why the peril is so great! In the corrupted currents of this world—\nACE: So just because some nutter comes on your radio and says it’s all a conspiracy, you believe him?\nTALPA: We’ve always believed it. The humans turned us into monsters.\nACE: Why?\nTALPA: They thought the Doctorium would kill us. Instead, it did this.\nACE: You’re wrong.\nTALPA: What do you know? You’re just a prisoner.\nACE: I’m no-one’s prisoner, mate, and I don’t believe the Doctor would do anything like that!\nTALPA: I’m living proof that he did. How do you think I feel, looking at my reflection, seeing a fanged demon, instead of the person I know I am? That I know I can be if I can fight the infection?\nACE: If it happened, it happened by accident! And he can undo it, too!\nTALPA: Very trusting, aren’t you?\nACE: Not as trusting as you are, mate! (LUNGES FORWARD —)\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 62\nACE: (MINOR GRUNT OF EFFORT - THE GUN’S HEAVY) Sorry, but if you will leave your rifle just lying around...\nTALPA: You’re right. You should definitely shoot me.\nACE: (STRUGGLING WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE WEAPON) Don’t think I won’t.\nTALPA: I know you will, you’ve shot me once today. But the vaccine gun was a medical device, it has to be simple.\nWHICH: DO NOTHING. IT STARTS TO RATTLE AS SHE STRUGGLES WITH IT.\nTALPA: You need training to use a weapon like that, though. You don’t have the strength, either. Getting heavy, isn’t it? And the longer you hold it, the heavier it gets.\nTALPA: Thank you. Now get up — break’s over.\nACE: I thought we were here for the night!\nTALPA: Sleep is for prisoners who don’t try to shoot me. Get up.\nACE: Forget it, Talpa. I’m not moving.\nTALPA: Then I’1ll move you! (SHOVES HER)\nACE: (SHOVED) Oof!\nTALPA: Now get up! You’re my prisoner, and when I say move, you move!\nACE: Talpa...? What’s happening to you?\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 63\nACE: SCENE 33: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — CORRIDOR\nACE: THE DOCTOR.\nMEL: Doctor, I’ve been looking for you.\nDOCTOR: Good morning, Mel.\nMEL: Please tell me you have some news about Ace.\nDOCTOR: I was going to say the same thing to you.\nMEL: (GROANS) You don’t think Juno’s right, do you?\nMEL: (SO SLIGHT DISTORT), PRECEDED BY A CATCHY JINGLE, NOT UNLIKE THE FANFARE IN EPISODE ONE.\nMIRANDA: (D) Obey and be attentive! Mogera sightings in sectors thirteen to twenty-seven have reached peak levels. These sectors are off-limits until further notice.\nDOCTOR: These people know more about Prosper than we do — in fact, I’m starting to think I never knew this world at all.\nMEL: You can’t blame yourself.\nDOCTOR: My tests on the Doctorium were insufficient. The Mogera were infected, which led to this.\nMEL: Well, even if that’s true, there’s nothing you can do about that, is there?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been wondering about that...\nMEL: Doctor, you can’t be thinking what I think you’re thinking.\nDOCTOR: Is there anywhere we can talk in private?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: SCENE 34: INT. THE CLOVEN PINE\nSWING: OPEN AS MEL AND THE DOCTOR ENTER.\nTRINK: Welcome to the Cloven Pine, esteemed visitors! Can I get you some ale?\nMEL: I’m afraid we don’t have any money. Do we?\nDOCTOR: None valid in this century.\nTRINK: Well, it’s three Doits a pint for the riff-raff, but it’s not every day we get distinguished visitors.\nDOCTOR: Oh!\nTRINK: So I'll put it on your slate.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nMEL: Ale sounds fine.\nDOCTOR: Just water for me, please.\nTRINK: Trust me, you don’t want the water. Ever been on a sandminer? Say no more.\nMEL: Two ales, please.\nTRINK: Trolley’s over there, if you want anything off it. I’d leave the custards, if I were you.\nMEL: No, thanks.\nTRINK: Two ales coming up.\nTRINK: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 65\nMEL: They’ve got all the period ambience right, haven’t they?\nDOCTOR: The period being this period. The tides of time, remember?\nMEL: I almost expect to see a pig, roasting on a spit.\nDOCTOR: No pigs on Prosper.\nMEL: I don’t eat meat, anyway.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t as private as I would have wished, but for a ship’s galley, it has character.\nMEL: Well? You were going to tell me what you’d been wondering about.\nDOCTOR: Do you really need me to tell you?\nMEL: You want to go back in time, don’t you? Change what you did a hundred years ago.\nDOCTOR: Something along those lines, yes.\nMEL: How would you even do that?\nDOCTOR: Punch myself on the nose, perhaps. I’d say it was the least I deserve, wouldn’t you?\nMEL: In all the years I’ve known you, you’ve never talked about doing something like this.\nDOCTOR: I haven’t been responsible for the deaths of millions before.\nMEL: It’s not just that, though, is it? There’s Ace, too.\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: She’s probably dead because of me.\nMEL: We don’t know that. She’s a fighter.\nDOCTOR: Against an entire nation of Mogera.\nDOCTOR: Page 66\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: SCENE 35: EXT. WASTES OF PROSPER\nTALPA: A plague upon this howling!\nACE: It’s not that bad. You should visit the Shetland Islands sometime.\nTALPA: Insolent noisemaker!\nACE: You get that you’re talking to the wind, right? It’s not going to die down just because you want it to.\nACE: Talpa! Talpa, stop! You’re going to hit me!\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 68\nACE: SCENE 36: INT. THE CLOVEN PINE\nMEL: You can’t seriously be thinking about rewriting a century of history, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: More than thinking about it, Mel - it’s what I have to do.\nMEL: You can’t!\nDOCTOR: You seen me commit the occasional temporal infraction before now.\nMEL: Pompeii, you mean? That was cheating at best, but this - this is huge! The Time Lords won’t let you.\nDOCTOR: It’s a higher authority I’m more concerned about.\nMEL: A higher authority than the Time Lords?\nDOCTOR: There are more things in the dark abysm of Time, Mel... You reap what you sow in this universe.\nMEL: And you’d risk it all for Ace.\nDOCTOR: For either of you.\nMEL: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No?\nMEL: I’m just as responsible for what’s happened on Prosper as you are, and while there’s even a chance that we can find Ace, that we can help these people right now — humans and Mogera — then we can’t just make it like it never happened. I won’t let you. So get back to your lab, and you find a way to end this madness, So we can go out there and look for Ace.\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: Moments like this remind me why I came looking for you, Mel. I’1ll see you later.\nDOCTOR: DOWN.\nTRINK: Your ales.\nMEL: Oh, I’m afraid my friend’s gone now. Sorry.\nTRINK: Good, ‘cause I want to talk to you.\nMEL: What?\nTRINK: I said I need to talk to you.\nMEL: OK, pull up a chair.\nTRINK: Well, I can’t talk to you now, can I? I’m working. But we do need to talk. Come back here after closing time. Everything depends on it.\nTRINK: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 70\nTRINK: SCENE 37: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — LAB\nCALIBAN: I say, a pox on the throats of these bawling, blasphemous, uncharitable dogs! We are what our reflections would have us be — once we were fair, and we treated our visitors fairly. [But now we have the aspect of demons, and as demons we must act! To the humans, I say give thanks you have lived so long!]\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Juno, I was wondering- Oh, is this live?\nJUNO: Live? No, just examining some old footage of Caliban — know your enemy. Enough prating, hag-born fiend!\nJUNO: Now, Doctor, how do you propose to slow down my vital work today?\nDOCTOR: I’m supposed to be helping you.\nJUNO: And I’m supposed to be married to Coragio Welkin.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nJUNO: The actor? It doesn’t matter, he died years ago. What do you want now?\nDOCTOR: Well, it occurs to me that if I could retrieve some equipment from my TARDIS-\nJUNO: Absolutely out of the question.\nDOCTOR: I really think-\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 71\nJUNO: I have yet to see any firm evidence of that, Doctor. Your sole contribution to our efforts thus far has been to endanger the life of the Minister of Fate. And now you wish to send some other poor soul to face the same dangers on your behalf.\nDOCTOR: I’m quite willing to go alone.\nJUNO: And in allowing you to do so, I risk jeopardising any potential benefit you may represent.\nDOCTOR: You seem certain I don’t represent any sort of benefit.\nJUNO: The Minister disagrees with me, unfortunately. So whatever you want to do, you’1ll have to do it with our rather primitive equipment.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’ve seen your staffs perform short-range weather manipulation.\nJUNO: Scarcely news to me.\nDOCTOR: I thought that perhaps their range could be augmented.\nJUNO: Then you thought wrong.\nDOCTOR: If a large enough storm could be created, then the Mogera would retreat to their burrows, giving Alonso the opportunity to transmat in and talk to Caliban.\nJUNO: A delightful fantasy, Doctor. Do please tell me another, I have difficulty sleeping at nights.\nDOCTOR: But-—\nJUNO: But me no more buts. If you’d bothered to check the data you’1ll know that Doctorium is incapable of generating the power required to operate a transmat or to conjure up storms of the size you’re suggesting.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR: But-—\nJUNO: What did I just say about that word? Take a sample to the aft quarters and test it, if it means you’1l be out of my way, but I promise you, the limits of Doctorium were established a century ago.\nDOCTOR: “Incapable of generating the power..?” It’s impossible! It’s simply not possible!\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: SCENE 38: INT. THE CLOVEN PINE\nMEL: Hello? Are you there?\nTRINK: Evenin’.\nMEL: You gave me a fright!\nTRINK: sorry.\nMEL: Can’t we have the lights on in here?\nTRINK: You meet a better class of person in the dark, Mel.\nMEL: You said everything depended on me talking to you. Please let that be true.\nTRINK: It’s me.\nMEL: What is?\nTRINK: Good old Trink, eh! Who’d have thought it?\nMEL: What’s a Trink?\nTRINK: I am!\nMEL: Oh, right.\nTRINK: Everybody knows me. I’m a local legend.\nMEL: That’s nice.\nTRINK: Seriously, no-one’s mentioned me?\nTRINK: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 74\nMEL: Well, I have only just arrived. What was it you wanted to tell me?\nTRINK: It’s me.\nMEL: You already said that. What's you?\nTRINK: Setebos. (PAUSE; IN POSHER SETEBOS VOICE) Setebos.\nMEL: Oh, wait, I’ve heard that name.\nTRINK: I should think you have, he’s a legend!\nMEL: So you’re two legends?\nTRINK: Bet nobody else can say that.\nMEL: Actually, I know someone who’s seven legends. But why does it matter that you’re this Setebos?\nTRINK: I know things.\nMEL: Good for you.\nTRINK: I know my ancestors deliberately mutated the Mogera.\nMEL: I’m fairly sure that’s not true.\nTRINK: So pretty, but so naive. I knew when I saw you on the bridge that I could trust you. But I don’t trust him.\nMEL: By “him,” I take it you mean the Doctor?\nTRINK: He’s too pally with a certain someone in a position of authority.\nTRINK: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 75\nMEL: You mean Juno?\nTRINK: (CHUCKLES) I would love to know what the League of Technogicians have to hide, wouldn’t you? But you — you’re important, Mel, that’s why I need your endorsement when I make my next broadcast — ‘cause it could be my last.\nMEL: Look, Trink- Do you prefer to be called Trink?

Don’t worry, Trink didn’t get the chance to tell her anything. But she got away before I could take care of her.\nCALIBAN: (D) Good.\nMIRANDA: How is that good?\nCALIBAN: (D) A Doctor with a dead companion is a dangerous adversary; a Doctor with an endangered companion is knit up in his distractions.\nMIRANDA: So I can’t kill her?\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 78\nCALIBAN: (D) I would lift the moon out of her sphere and give it to you for an apple if I could, Miranda, but this request I must deny.\nMIRANDA: Fine!\nCALIBAN: (D) Good girl.

You learn that sort of thing when you spend enough time with the Doctor.\nTALPA: And you say he’s a good man.\nACE: Yeah, I do say that.

He was on his way to get it when he was shot.\nDOCTOR: And you didn’t see who did it?\nMEL: I was too busy running for my life.

Making an early start, Juno?\nJUNO: Look who’s talking.\nALONSO: I assumed the Doctor would be here also. He’s not in his quarters, either. Where’s he got to?\nJUNO: You tell me. I’m not his gaoler.\nALONSO: He’s a guest, Juno, not a prisoner. He can come and go as he pleases.\nJUNO: He’1ll be happy to hear that. Last time I saw him, he was talking about going back to his ship.\nALONSO: What?\nJUNO: It’d be no great loss, Minister.

Believe me, I know the weight of a saucepan.\nMEL: Trink didn’t die for the sake of a heavier than usual saucepan.\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: It’s the handle that’s heavy. So if we unscrew it...\nMEL: There’s something inside it.\nDOCTOR: I think I can reach it...\nMEL: What is it?\nDOCTOR: This, I suspect, is the device Trink used to hack into human and Mogera frequencies.\nMEL: That’s how he got his conspiracy theories out! Right under everyone’s noses.\nDOCTOR: I wish I’d met this Trink properly, in spite of his opinion of me.\nMEL: So what’s on it?\nDOCTOR: Umm...\nDOCTOR: SIZE.\nDOCTOR: Nothing. The memory’s empty.\nMEL: (SIGHS) He never got a chance to record it.\nDOCTOR: Everything he either knew, or thought he knew, really did die with him.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: SCENE 46: EXT. WASTES OF PROSPER\nACE: And what sort of time do you call this?\nACE: I had to make the fire the old-fashioned way. I was never a Girl Guide, but you wouldn’t know looking at that, would you?\nTALPA: (HIS VOICE IS NOTICEABLY HIGHER) What... what?\nACE: Word of warning, don’t ever ask the Doctor how to make one of these — it’s all shoelaces, cavemen skulls and sabre-tooth tiger fat in his book.\nTALPA: Ace... You didn’t run away.\nACE: I didn’t, did I? Maybe I’m not as scared of you as you think I ought to be.

WASTES OF PROSPER\nTALPA: I feel different. I sound different. Do I look different?\nACE: Not so you’d know it - still got the fangs, and the talons. Maybe you’ve lost a little fierceness in your snout. But I reckon if we give you a few weeks off the shots...\nTALPA: I thought this was it. That my mind was going to go the same way as the rest of me.\nACE: You weren’t getting worse, Talpa, you were having a comedown.\nTALPA: And you recognised that?\nACE: What can I say, you can take the girl out of the council estate...\nTALPA: You're saying I was drugged?\nACE: I think so. And I think you did it to yourself, all of you.\nTALPA: The ampoules.\nACE: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that. Didn’t you say you had to take a green one first, and then three yellow ones?\nTALPA: That’s right.\nACE: I think that’s how they did it. The green one causes the mutation, the yellows keep it in check, just about stopping you from going the way you thought you were going. I suppose I didn’t really help you all that much when I shot you full of the stuff.\nTALPA: Don’t worry, I think we’re even.\nTALPA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 92\nACE: When I start taking potshots at anything in my eyeline because I don’t like the way the clouds are looking at me, then we’1l be even.\nTALPA: We Mogera don’t respond well to rough weather.\nACE: The important thing is that you know the Doctor couldn’t have done this to you.\nTALPA: Yes. Yes, I suppose I do know that. And if he didn’t do it... then some of my Burrow-Brothers did.\nACE: I think both of us need to have a word with your General Caliban.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 93\nACE: SCENE 49: INT.

You know the Minister was looking for you all morning. What are you doing here?\nMEL: The Doctor asked me to work out a way of... blocking the broadcasts from Tr[ink]- (STOPS, CATCHES HERSELF) Setebos.\nJUNO: We haven’t suffered one of those in the past 24 hours, praise mercy. So how’s it going?\nMEL: Early days. Your alphabet’s changed a little since my time.\nJUNO: I hear you’re supposed to be very clever, I’m sure you’1ll adapt.\nMEL: The TARDIS usually does it for me — with something like this, it takes a little longer. But I’m managing.\nJUNO: Good.\nMEL: I’1ll let you know if I have a breakthrough.\nJUNO: That’ll be nice.

How small do you think this planet is?\nACE: Then where’ve we been headed all this time?\nTALPA: We can’t dig our way everywhere. Sometimes we have to fly.\nACE: What, you can fly, too?\nTALPA: Yeah, we can fly, too. In magical machines with wings and engines.\nACE: You know, Talpa, it seems like one of the side-effects of getting off the drugs is that you’ve become a bit of a prat.\nTALPA: Seems that way.

I haven’t had an ugly incarnation yet, but I’m sure I must be due for one.\nMEL: Doctor, what exactly happened?\nDOCTOR: I wish I knew, Mel. It should have worked — I ran repeated simulations, I re-tested the Doctorium.\nMEL: Then it must have been sabotage. Only someone in the League of Technogicians could have that kind of knowledge.\nALONSO: (APPROACHING) Oh, my friend, you’ve had quite a day.\nDOCTOR: It certainly hasn’t gone the way I expected it to.\nALONSO: Juno explained the whole thing to me.\nMEL: Did she? I’d be very interested to hear that explanation.\nALONSO: I’m just relieved you realized the limitations of Doctorium before it cost you your life.\nMEL: “Limitations”?\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: Yes, Alonso, I see that now.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I’d be interested in examining the data, to understand just where I went wrong.\nALONSO: If you’d regained consciousness an hour or two earlier, Doctor, that might have been possible. Juno deemed it inadvisable for even the last piece of the experiment to be recoverable, and I must confess, I agree with her. Everything has been dismantled, and all records wiped.\nMEL: She’s very thorough, isn’t she? How long has she been Chief Mage now? Fourteen years, isn’t it?\nALONSO: I believe it is, Mel.

I don’t know why, I just find her so fascinating.\nALONSO: Well, Doctor, I wish I could stay with you a while longer, but my work is never done.\nDOCTOR: Another emergency?\nALONSO: Of a rather mundane nature, I’m afraid.

I can’t find any mention of mention of Caliban in any of the humans’ intelligence reports until he became leader of the Mogera — it’s as though before that, he didn’t exist!\nDOCTOR: What is it you’re trying to say, Mel?\nMEL: I’m saying Trink was right to suspect Juno. I think it seemed like Caliban didn’t exist because he doesn’t exist. Why do you think he needs that voice synthesizer? Not because he was wounded in battle...\nDOCTOR: But because Juno and Caliban are one and the same.\nMEL: She’s posing as him, stage-managing the entire war to wipe out the Mogera!\nDOCTOR: For a moment, I thought you were about to say it was Coragio Welkin.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 105\nMEL: Who?\nDOCTOR: The actor. But Mel, in order for that to be true, Juno would have to have access to transmat technology.\nMEL: Which you say should be completely possible and she says isn’t! The whole of the League of Technogicians have been tricked! And who’s in charge of the League, who dismantled your equipment and wiped all the data? Well?\nDOCTOR: It’s still just a theory. How do you propose we prove it?\nMEL: By uncovering Juno’s transmat device.\nDOCTOR: Easier said than done.\nMEL: Said and done!\nDOCTOR: You’ve found it?\nMEL: Let me show you — I borrowed this tablet from the Technogicians’ lab.\nMEL: I love these, when are we going to get them on Earth? Now, look\nMEL: at this.\nDOCTOR: Blueprints.\nMEL: The original designs for The Duke of Milan.\nDOCTOR: Oh, look, they went back to using cubits. Very wise.\nMEL: Now this is the current layout of the ship. Notice anything different?\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: Not until I stop seeing double, I’m afraid.\nMEL: How about if I overlay one on the other? Now, pay close attention to this section. There’s a compartment right here that’s on the original blueprints but not the current plans.\nDOCTOR: Just large enough for a transmat chamber.\nMEL: I thought so, too. And look how close it is to the labs.\nDOCTOR: I should say it’s worth a look. What are we waiting for?\nMEL: “We\"?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I’ve grown impatient being a patient. Help me detach all these wires, would you?\nMEL: I thought you were still seeing double.\nDOCTOR: Then there’1ll only be half as many wires to deal with as I thought.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: SCENE 56: INT. MOGERA FLIGHT VESSEL\nKLOSSI: Put her anywhere, son, no need to be gentle.\nTALPA: Klossi, I think you hit her too hard.\nKLOSSI: There’s no such thing as “too hard.” They don’t feel things like we do, remember.\nKLOSSTI: Hey, pilot — what’s the hold-up? We want to be back home!\nKLOSSI: What’s your problem, Talpa? If we get hungry, we’ve got ourselves an in-flight meal.\nKLOSSI: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 108\nKLOSSI: SCENE 57: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — CORRIDOR\nKLOSSI: QUIET.\nMEL: It should be somewhere around here.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing?\nMEL: It always works in films. You keep knocking on the wall until you hear a sort of hollow sound, you know you’ve found the hidden room.\nDOCTOR: Much as I admire the old-fashioned methods, I think we can speed the process up a little.\nDOCTOR: Here.\nMEL: Behind the painting of Queen Elizabeth?\nDOCTOR: The label says it’s Empress Beyonce The Second.\nDOCTOR: Shall we?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: SCENE 58: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER (CONTINUOUS)\nMEL: I was right!\nDOCTOR: You almost sound like you don’t believe it.\nMEL: Well, it’s one thing to say, it’s another thing to actually find the proof of it.\nMEL: INTO LIFE.\nMEL: It really is a transmat! Powered by Doctorium?\nDOCTOR: I can’t tell you how much I’ve gone off that name. This is interesting, though.\nMEL: What is?\nDOCTOR: Quite a range on it — it could send a person anywhere on Prosper.\nMEL: Including Mogera territory.\nDOCTOR: It’s also linked directly to another transmat machine. I wonder where that is?\nMEL: We could go there and find out for ourselves.\nDOCTOR: It might be dangerous.\nMEL: It almost certainly will be. What are we waiting for?\nNOISE: SLOWLY RISES IN VOLUME.\nDOCTOR: (AS HE DEMATERIALISES) Here we go...\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 110\nMIRANDA: You’re not going anywhere!\nMEL: Doctor, look out!\nFOLLOWED: BY A SMALL EXPLOSION AND SPARKS.\nFOLLOWED: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 111\nFOLLOWED: SCENE 59: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nDOCTOR: Mel! (PAUSE) Mel? She didn’t come through with me — that’s alarming. I hope she’s in less trouble than I am.\nDOCTOR: THE DUKE)\nDOCTOR: Oh, well, mustn’t keep the General waiting.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: SCENE 60: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: OVER THE RADIO.\nMIRANDA: (D) I saw that the transmat had been breached. In my haste to respond, I may have damaged it.\nCALIBAN: Not permanently, I’m sure. We’ve just had an arrival at this end.\nMIRANDA: (D) The Doctor.\nCALIBAN: The legends don’t exaggerate his resourcefulness.\nDOCTOR: Why do I get the feeling I was expected?\nCALIBAN: Sooner or later, it was inevitable, Doctor. But I’m glad it’s taken you this long. You’re in good time.\nDOCTOR: For tea?\nCALIBAN: For the end game.\nDOCTOR: It’s never for tea.\nCALIBAN: Take care of things at your end, Miranda.\nMIRANDA: (D) You can rely on me.\nDOCTOR: I’m a big fan of your videos, General Caliban. In fact, I’m seriously thinking about subscribing.\nCALIBAN: And for my part, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you ever Since you arrived on Prosper.\nCALIBAN: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t think so.\nCALIBAN: No?\nDOCTOR: We’ve met before, haven’t we? Several times, in fact, on The Duke of Milan.\nDOCTOR: You know the means by which I came here, there really is no point in denying it.\nCALIBAN: Oh, I don’t deny it, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I know that underneath that mask you’re not a Mogera at all —\nDOCTOR: you’re human.\nCALIBAN: You’re quite correct, Doctor. I am indeed human...\nALONSO: (DEEP GULP OF AIR) .. but probably not the human you were\nALONSO: expecting.\nDOCTOR: Alonso?\nCALIBAN: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 114"

I am indeed human...\nALONSO: (DEEP GULP OF AIR) ..But probably not the human you were\nALONSO: expecting.\nDOCTOR: Alonso?\nCALIBAN: SCENE CONTINUES:\nCALIBAN: SCENE 61: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR (CONTINUOUS)\nALONSO: I’m so very tired. You’ve no idea how exhausting it is, dematerialising here, rematerialising there.\nDOCTOR: I think I might.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 115\nALONSO: You know, I was hoping for more of a reaction - that’s something of a let-down. I was under the impression that you were beginning to suspect Juno.\nDOCTOR: You are and your ancestors have been running quite an operation, Alonso.\nALONSO: I knew you’d be as clever as they said. You were just a little slow on the uptake, that’s all.\nDOCTOR: No one person could have kept the properties of Doctorium secret for a century.\nALONSO: How true, how true. And you’re quite right about that, Doctor — my daughter, Miranda, has been my faithful accomplice.\nDOCTOR: Your daughter? Well, that makes a depressing amount of sense.\nALONSO: It’s a wise father that knows their own child, Doctor.\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 116\nALONSO: SCENE 62: INT.

Caliban.\nMEL: (GROANS) Right idea, wrong person.\nMIRANDA: Now: Get up.\nMIRANDA: I said... Get up!\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 117\nMIRANDA: SCENE 63: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nDOCTOR: You’ve been at this quite some time, haven’t you?\nALONSO: I, and the Milanese who came before me.\nDOCTOR: Oh, you gave yourselves a name? That’s never a good sign.\nALONSO: After a century’s effort, I think we’ve earned that at the very least.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you think if you’d been less elaborate and gone without the subterfuge, you’d have got the job done long ago?\nALONSO: What exactly is it that you imagine we’re doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The same as all the other madmen I’ve encountered in my travels — the extermination of an entire race.\nALONSO: I prefer to think of it as “pruning”.\nDOCTOR: And how do you think the Mogera see it?\nALONSO: The Mogera? My dear Doctor, the Mogera are of no importance to our plans whatever, except insofar as they serve a purpose.

He won’t like that.\nMEL: Well, if that’s the worst thing that happens to hin...\nMIRANDA: You should be more concerned about what’s going to happen to you, Mel. My father gave strict me orders not to kill you. But I think the situation has changed quite a bit of late.

CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nALONSO: One hundred years ago, Doctor, you created this situation.\nDOCTOR: I thought we’d already established that I didn’t.\nALONSO: And when did we do that?\nDOCTOR: When it became clear that the Doctorium posed no threat to the Mogera.\nALONSO: The Mogera, the Mogera! Forget the Mogera! Think instead of the humans you abandoned on Prosper.\nDOCTOR: Abandoned, simply because you weren’t prepared to share a planet?\nALONSO: Did you ever do some simple arithmetic before selecting this\nALONSO: brave new world for us to spend the remainder of our days on? Prosper is far from barren, but did you really imagine it was large or fertile enough for an entire fleet? Before the first settler even set foot here, we Milanese had established that\nALONSO: our numbers were at unsustainable levels.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t know.\nALONSO: You could have known. But you, Doctor, were interested only in saving the day — that one day, with no consideration of all the days to come. That problem you left to my illustrious ancestor, Lorenzo, and his inner circle.\nDOCTOR: The original Milanese.\nALONSO: We poor, ignorant humans aren’t like you, Doctor — we can’t simply wait for time to tell the tale. Had we done so, it would have ended in death.\nDOCTOR: It always does, Alonso, it’s just a matter of how long you have to: Walt for. at.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 120\nALONSO: You have no right to judge those great men! You placed them in an impossible situation and turned your back on them!\nDOCTOR: I almost hate to ask what course of action they decided upon.\nALONSO: Because you’ve finally realised, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: A cull.\nALONSO: Of course, despite the necessity of the enterprise, you can imagine that the settlers would be rather unwilling to volunteer themselves for sacrifice.\nDOCTOR: People can be strange about things like that.\nALONSO: There was, of course, only one logical solution: manufacture an enemy to do the job for us.\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 121\nALONSO: SCENE 66: INT. MOGERA FLIGHT VESSEL\nALONSO: DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING THEIR RIFLES.\nKLOSST: I sometimes wonder if I don’t love my gun more than I love my claws, you know. That’s not wrong, is it?\nTALPA: She’s coming round.\nKLOSSTI: Good, I like my meat fresh.\nTALPA: Too late for that — we’re about to land.\nTALPA: Can you hear me, Ace- (CHECKS HIMSELF) — human?\nKLOSST: I think you’re getting far too fond of this creature. You know Caliban’s going to turn her inside out?\nTALPA: He just wants to talk to her.\nKLOSSTI: You’re not thinking of asking if you can keep her as a pet, are you?\nTALPA: She’s not a pet, she’s a person!\nKLOSST: You're really starting to worry me, Talpa. I think it’d be best if I took her to the General.\nTALPA: She’s my prisoner!\nKLOSSTI: She was your prisoner — now she’s mine. D’you want to fight me for her, Talpa? Because I really don’t think you’re up to it.\nKLOSSTI: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 122\nMOGERA: 1, 2 & 3:\nSLOWLY: COMES TO A STOP.\nTALPA: You don’t even want the promotion!\nKLOSSTI: I don’t want to stop killing humans, I never said I didn’t want promotion. Now step away from her, boy.\nACE: Not so fast!\nACE: You heard what Talpa said, I’m his prisoner! Now back off, Godzilla!\nKLOSSTI: (LAUGHS) Don’t waste your time, little girl! I doubt you can hold Talpa’s rifle much longer, and you definitely don’t know how to use it.\nACE: You're right, it is heavy. But you’re wrong when you think I’ve been unconscious up ‘til now. I came to ages ago, and I’ve been watching your lot field-stripping your weapons. I reckon I could handle one.\nKLOSSTI: Give me that!\nBEFORE: COLLAPSING.\nMOGERA: 1, 2 & 3:\nACE: Same goes for the rest of you - back off, Super Furry Animals!\nKLOSSI: (AN EXCLAMATION OF ANNOYANCE AND DISCOMFORT THAT CONVEYS THE\nFACT: THAT ACE DIDN'T SHOOT TO KILL)\nACE: Talpa!\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 123\nTALPA: What?\nACE: Take the gun!\nTALPA: (STRUGGLES) All right, got it! Now listen — she’s my prisoner. Nobody takes her to Caliban but me!\nTALPA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 124\nTALPA: SCENE 67: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nMEL: The crash — that was all staged, wasn’t it?\nMIRANDA: Of course it was.\nMEL: Alonso was never attacked by the Mogera at all. He never even went out looking for Ace.\nMIRANDA: Why would he? He wanted her out of the way, wanted the Doctor anxious.\nMEL: But he could have died, Miranda! How could you just stand there and let that happen?\nMIRANDA: Do you even listen to what you’re saying? It was all staged — all of it. He was never in that transport. It was pre- programmed to hit the hull of The Duke; my father wasn’t even on board.\nMEL: Then, how..? (GROANS; REALISATION) He transmatted in just after the crash. Oh, that is brilliant!\nMIRANDA: He thought so. I thought you’d be clever enough to see through it. Obviously, I gave you too much credit.\nMEL: If he was right about that, maybe he was right about not killing me.\nMIRANDA: The Doctor’s in Caliban’s burrow now. He knows the truth. There’s no need to keep up the pretence. The hour’s almost come, Mel.\nMEL: What does that mean?\nMIRANDA: For you, it means not having to worry about the Doctor or Ace any longer, for me it means I finally get to-\nMIRANDA: OBJECT.\nMIRANDA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 125\nMEL: Thanks for that, Juno!\nJUNO: Don’t mention it. She was going to kill you.\nMEL: Looks that way, doesn’t it?\nJUNO: I heard a shot, and came looking and- and-\nMEL: And discovered a room you’ve never seen before, right?\nJUNO: That’s right. Will you please tell me what the hell is going around here?\nJUNO: on\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 126\nJUNO: SCENE 68: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nALONSO: The original Milanese carried out the mutation of the Mogera with a steroid-infused gas.\nDOCTOR: Genetically-targeted, I imagine.\nALONSO: Well, naturally. As time went on, and we infiltrated what passes for the higher levels of what passes for their society, we were able to introduce the concept of regular anti-Doctorium inoculations.\nDOCTOR: Simply a more direct way of introducing the toxin into their systems.\nALONSO: If you want to cut down the population, it’s best not to tell them you’re doing it. If you want the population to inject themselves with a drug so frequently that it becomes an addiction, don’t let them know why they actually need to take aes\nDOCTOR: You made them into monsters.\nALONSO: After you made us into monsters! Do you think I’m proud of the pain we inflicted on the Mogera?\nDOCTOR: Honestly? Yes.\nALONSO: Well, perhaps a little, but why shouldn’t I be — after a century’s work on the part of my forefathers, and no small effort on my own part?\nDOCTOR: Don’t sell yourself short, Alonso. You engineered the Mogera attacks and the human resistance.\nALONSO: Not too resistant. It’s all finely-calculated, down to the very last casualty.\nDOCTOR: And all to ensure a viable gene pool.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 127\nALONSO: All to ensure the continuation of our noble race on Prosper.\nDOCTOR: You call mass murder noble?\nALONSO: Well, I wouldn’t call it murder, so I suppose it all comes down to semantics in the end. And we are nearing the end, Doctor. Believe me when I say that every possible contingency was accounted for a hundred years ago, including the remote possibility of your return.\nDOCTOR: Ace didn’t get separated from us by accident, did she?\nALONSO: There are no accidents. You must have known that when I was forced to sabotage your little experiment.\nDOCTOR: You weren’t expecting me to show up in your lair, though, were you?\nALONSO: The correct term is ‘burrow’, Doctor. The point is, nobody on The Duke of Milan knows where you are now.\nDOCTOR: Mel knows.\nALONSO: And my daughter is dealing with Mel. Despite my earlier injunctions, I suspect she’s quite keen on killing your companion. What sort of parent would I be if I didn’t give my child just what she wanted?\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 128\nALONSO: SCENE 69: INT. ENTRANCE TO CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nAGAIN: DRAGGING HIS RIFLE. ECHO ON DIALOG THROUGHOUT.\nACE: I think I might’ve misjudged burrows, Talpa. As a place to live, I mean. Couple of rugs, a lampshade, it’d be nicer than the place I grew up.\nTALPA: They used to be a lot smaller. We used to be a lot smaller.\nACE: You can drop that gun now, you know.\nTALPA: I suppose I’11 have to.\nTALPA: Too heavy for either one of us to carry. The question is, what do we do when we get to Caliban?\nACE: The Doctor should have a few ideas.\nTALPA: The Doctor? He’s back in the human territory, probably on The Duke of Milan.\nACE: Not once he’s figured out that Caliban has all the answers. He’1ll want to talk to him as badly as we do.\nTALPA: Sorry, Ace, that’s me.\nACE: Just when I think I’ve seen everything a Mogera can do.\nTALPA: I mean it’s my communicator. I’ve got a message... and it’s from the Doctor!\nTALPA: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 129\nTALPA: SCENE 70: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nJUNO: Where did this place come from?\nMEL: For a scientist, you don’t have a lot of curiosity, do you?\nJUNO: So it would seem. How’s this?\nMIRANDA: Ow!\nMEL: I think that means the rope’s tight enough.\nJUNO: Knot-tying’s not really my area of expertise. I don’t want to cut off her circulation.\nMIRANDA: You don’t know what I’m going to cut off you when I get free!\nJUNO: You know, Miranda, when you had this attitude towards the Mogera, I was fine with it, but now it’s just disturbing.\nMEL: Just so long as she can’t try to kill us again.\nMIRANDA: You. I was trying to kill you. Juno, untie me!\nJUNO: No.\nMIRANDA: This is high treason!\nJUNO: And this is a transmat chamber. At least, it looks like one. And that should be impossible. So I want you to tell me right now-\nPREVIOUS: SCENE.\nJUNO: Excuse me, I’ve got mail.\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 130\nMEL: And it definitely can’t wait?\nJUNO: Not this one — the Doctor’s sent me a file.\nMIRANDA: The Doctor?\nMEL: What is it?\nMEL: PART THREE IS REPLAYED.\nDOCTOR: I know that underneath that mask you’re not a Mogera at all — you’re human.\nCALIBAN: You’re quite correct, Doctor. I am indeed human...\nALONSO: (DEEP GULP OF AIR) .. but probably not the human you were\nALONSO: expecting.\nJUNO: Minister?\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 131\nJUNO: SCENE 71: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nALONSO: Now does my project gather to a head. Two more weeks is all it will take. Two weeks precisely. The final Mogera assaults will at last reduce our population to a manageable size.\nDOCTOR: “Manageable” — not the first time I’ve heard the word used in that context.\nALONSO: I don’t expect you to approve because I don’t expect you to understand.\nDOCTOR: Clearly, you don’t expect either the Mogera or your fellow humans to understand, either.\nALONSO: They don’t have to understand to benefit from the bright future I’ve shaped for them. Except for the Mogera, of course, they’1ll all be dead. But you can’t make an omelette without killing a few eggs, as I believe the expression goes.\nDOCTOR: Then it’s probably just as well that they haven’t been let in on your grand scheme for them.\nALONSO: Obviously, I take no great pleasure in committing... what should one call it?\nDOCTOR: Genocide.\nALONSO: Pest control. — But once they’ve served their purpose, they’re really just using up our precious air and resources, to say nothing of all that valuable Doctorium they’re sitting on top of.\nDOCTOR: What do you imagine they’d say about that?\nALONSO: Oh, I imagine they’d be furious, but then they’re always furious, aren’t they? We designed them that way.\nDOCTOR: And the humans?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 132\nALONSO: I’m not really interested in playing hypotheticals any more, Doctor. I have enjoyed our little visit — apart from Miranda, there isn’t really anybody else capable of appreciating the scale of the Milanese plan. But now I think it’s time...\nCALIBAN: To notify those poor credulous monsters that their greatest foe has somehow made his way into their leader’s burrow.\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary, “General Caliban”. You see, they already know.\nCALIBAN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: This recording device recently came into my possession. I believe your daughter killed its inventor.\nCALIBAN: Setebos!\nDOCTOR: It’s a clever little thing, able to transmit on all available channels.\nCALIBAN: Wait, wait...\nALONSO: -more weeks is all it will take. Two weeks precisely. The final Mogera assaults will at last reduce our population to a manageable size.\nDOCTOR: “Manageable” — not the first time I’ve heard the word used in that context.\nALONSO: I don’t expect you to approve because I don’t expect you to understand.\nDOCTOR: Your revels now are ended.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 133\nCALIBAN: Do you have any idea what you’ve done?\nDOCTOR: The point is, Alonso, everyone on Prosper now knows precisely what you’ve done... and I think it’s safe to say that they won’t be happy about it.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: SCENE 72: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nJUNO: Nearly got it...\nJUNO: Good grief!\nMEL: Do you think you can fix it?\nJUNO: Fix it? I shouldn’t even touch it! Mel, I’ve never seen technology like this before.\nMEL: Well, you’ve got next to no time to become an expert, because we've got to get the Doctor out of there!\nJUNO: I expect Miranda could help. Could you?\nMIRANDA: Just release me and find out.\nJUNO: I withdraw the suggestion.\nMEL: Don’t worry, I was never considering it. She’d probably use it to scatter your atoms across the entire planet.\nMIRANDA: I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now you’ve given me the idea, it’s all I can think about.\nJUNO: Ah, this looks promising...\nJUNO: Ow! Skainsmate! Pardon my French.\nMEL: Just get it working!\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 135\nJUNO: I always did think there was something a bit odd about you, Miranda, even when you were a child. I blame the parent.\nMEL: So do the Mogera, which means the Doctor’s going to be in the\nMEL: middle of a bloodbath any minute!\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 136\nMEL: SCENE 73: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nCALIBAN: What happens next is on your head, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: The events of the last century are on my head also, so that seems only fair.\nCALIBAN: Perhaps the damage to the transmat isn’t as bad as Miranda thought...\nPREVIOUS: EPISODE. THE ACTIVATION NOISE BEGINS, BUT QUICKLY DIES OUT.\nDOCTOR: Nothing. You have your own daughter to thank for that. Children can be such a handful, can’t they?\nCALIBAN: I only needed a little while longer. But we’1ll have to proceed to the final stage nonetheless.\nDOCTOR: Alonso, whatever it is you’re thinking of doing, please reconsider!\nCALIBAN: Computer, answer my best pleasure, and bring forth a torment to lay upon the damned!\nACE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello Ace. Making friends, I trust?\nACE: This is Talpa. He’s not like the other Mogera, don’t worry.\nTALPA: No, I’m not like the others. My rage is real, old man!\nCALIBAN: Stand down, burrow-brother, you’ve completed your mission.\nCALIBAN: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 137\nACE: Oh give it a rest, everyone’s seen who you are, granddad.\nCALIBAN: Who I am...\nALONSO: But not what I can do, child.\nTALPA: You deceived us all, made us do terrible things, made us into- terrible things.\nALONSO: Even at your best, you creatures were never particularly eloquent. You see what strange bedfellows I’ve had to work with here, Doctor?\nTALPA: All the deaths, ours and theirs...\nALONSO: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That’s all academic now. Just go back to your own burrow and wait for death, would you?\nDOCTOR: What have you done, Alonso?\nTALPA: At least you won’t have to wait for your death.\nACE: Forget him, Talpa.\nALONSO: A challenge? Well, I’m hardly a sprightly youngster any more, I’m not even a Mogera.\nACE: He’s right, just leave him.\nTALPA: Never! He’s used us, distorted us, killed us - and pretending to be one of us, that’s the sickest joke of all!\nALONSO: But artificial though they may be, my Mogera claws are just as sharp as yours!\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 138\nACE: He’s not kidding. Those are vicious — (WARNING) Talpa, look out!\nTALPA: (SHRIEKS IN PAIN — THEN, WOUNDED:) Wrong. Mine are sharper —\nALONSO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nALONSO: Page 139\nALONSO: SCENE 74: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nJUNO: I think that should do it. I mean, I hope that should do it.\nMEL: Then what are we waiting for?\nJUNO: Did you not just hear what I said? There’s no guarantee that the transmat will work properly.\nMIRANDA: Or at all.\nJUNO: Thank you for that, Miranda.\nMIRANDA: Looks like a botched job to me.\nJUNO: Yes, thank you!\nMEL: We need to send something through — the Doctor’s running out of\nMEL: time.\nJUNO: Miranda’s staff. No, stupid —\nJUNO: Miranda!\nMEL: It might kill her!\nJUNO: She almost killed you. Fair’s\nMIRANDA: I hate to say it, but she has\nMEL: You’ve changed your tune. The\nMIRANDA: Who knows?\nMEL: it needs to be something organic.\nMEL: fair.\nMEL: a point, Mel.\nMEL: transmat is repaired, isn’t it?\nMEL: You do! You want us to beam you over to your father, so he can release you, and then it’s two against one! Send me, Juno!\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 140\nJUNO: You're just guessing!\nMIRANDA: Let her do it, Juno - I’m interested to see what’1l happen.\nMEL: Oh, I’m not going alone. You’re coming with me, come on.\nJUNO: All right. Just stand right there. I think. There’s still time\nJUNO: to change your mind, Mel.\nMEL: Just do it, before I come to my senses.\nCOMES: IN.\nCOMES: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 141\nCOMES: SCENE 75: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nACE: Talpa! Talpa!\nDOCTOR: Ace, I’m so sorry.\nACE: You killed him, Alonso!\nALONSO: And he... me.\nACE: Then hurry up and die!\nALONSO: Not... before... the rest of his kind.\nDOCTOR: The order you gave the computer, Alonso — what did it mean?\nALONSO: I have... discharged what I strove to do. See for yourself, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No!\nACE: What is it, what’s happening?\nDOCTOR: There’s a storm brewing.\nACE: The Mogera hate storms!\nALONSO: They’1l hate this one most of all.\nDOCTOR: It’s the biggest this planet’s ever had! It’s brewing out at sea, look.\nGROWING: EVER LOUDER AS THE SCENE PROGRESSES.\nGROWING: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 142\nACE: It’s moving fast.\nDOCTOR: It’ll create a tsunami large enough to cover the entire Mogeran territory.\nACE: He’s going to drown them all!\nALONSO: Sea-water shall be their drink, and of their bones, shall coral be made!\nACE: Doctor, do something, shut it down!\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing I can do. Alonso, cancel the storm!\nACE: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Mel!\nMEL: Ace, thank goodness you’re safe!\nACE: Yeah, I get the impression I won’t be for much longer. You hear that sound?\nMIRANDA: Father!\nMIRANDA: What have you done to him?\nACE: My friend did to him exactly what he did to my friend.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 143\nMIRANDA: Father? Father, can you hear me? Untie me, Mel. Please!\nMEL: All right.\nACE: But I’m watching you.\nDOCTOR: Miranda — you’ve got to convince him to reverse the storm.\nMIRANDA: Father?\nALONSO: Miranda?\nMIRANDA: Yes. Yes, it’s me.\nALONSO: The experiment... has failed, Child. He that dies... (HE CHOKES) pays all debts...\nMIRANDA: Nooo!\nDOCTOR: Miranda, I’m sorry, but the Mogera are running out of time.\nMIRANDA: You’re wrong, Doctor - there’s no time at all.\nBEGIN: SHRIEKING IN TERROR.\nDOCTOR: Mel, you and Ace transmat back to The Duke!\nMEL: Not without you, Doctor!\nACE: Is there really no way of stopping this before the tsunami hits?\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: Not from here.\nACE: You hear that? The Mogera know what’s coming!\nMEL: Why not from here?\nDOCTOR: The program is voice-activated, and Alonso’s dead!\nMEL: Did he actually give the order?\nDOCTOR: Of course he did- No, wait! Caliban did!\nMEL: The synthesizer, put it on!\nDOCTOR: Where is it? Where did it go?\nMIRANDA: I’ve got it right here, Doctor.\nMIRANDA: CALIBAN/MIRANDA: Computer, answer my best pleasure — may a south-west blister\nMIRANDA: them all!\nMIRANDA: ONSCREEN.\nMEL: It’s almost here!\nDOCTOR: Oh, not just here...\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: SCENE 76: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nJUNO: FRANTICALLY ACTIVATES CONTROLS.\nJUNO: This message is going out on all available frequencies. Tornadoes are about to tear the colony ships to pieces. I don’t know if you can hear this, Doctor - but do something!\nJUNO: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 146\nJUNO: SCENE 77: INT. CALIBAN’S UNDERGROUND LAIR\nACE: Give me that mask-thing!\nACE: CALIBAN/MIRANDA: Not a chance!\nACE: THE PROCESS TAKES A LITTLE LONGER THIS TIME.\nDOCTOR: You're wasting your time, Miranda - there’s nowhere you’1ll be safe.\nDOCTOR: CALIBAN/MIRANDA:\nDOCTOR: That’s not the plan, Doctor. I’m going to disperse my atoms over the whole of Prosper, and I’m taking the synthesizer with me!\nMEL: This is insanity!\nMEL: CALIBAN/MIRANDA:\nMEL: It’s science! The experiment has been corrupted - it all has to be destroyed!\nACE: My name’s Ace. We haven’t been properly introduced. I’ve just got one question for you, Miranda - do you have the same claws\nACE: as your dad?\nACE: CALIBAN/MIRANDA: What? Claws?\nACE: Thought not!\nACE: CALIBAN/MIRANDA:\nMEL: Grab the synthesizer!\nMEL: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 147\nACE: Got it!\nDOCTOR: Now get out of there!\nDOCTOR: OPERATION.\nACE: Here, Doctor — do something brilliant with this!\nDOCTOR: Gladly!\nDOCTOR: CALIBAN/DOCTOR: Computer, answer my best pleasure and, er.. shut everything down, everything!\nDOCTOR: TEARS OFF THE SYNTHESIZER.\nDOCTOR: Phew! I hate to say it, but I think I’m several hundred years too old for these nick-of-time rescues.\nACE: It didn’t come in time for everybody.\nDOCTOR: No, Ace. No, it didn’t.\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: SCENE 78: INT. DUKE OF MILAN — TRANSMAT CHAMBER\nJUNO: Mel? Is that you?\nJUNO: ACE, ARE TALKING, AN EFFECT ON THEIR VOICES WHICH ENDS AS THEY REMATERIALISE.\nMEL: Did you have to shut down everything?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t exactly have a lot of time to think it through, Mel.\nMEL: But we were stuck for hours, while you tried to get the transmat working again!\nJUNO: Doctor, Mel! You’re all right!\nDOCTOR: All right? Far from it, I’m afraid.\nMEL: Juno, this is Ace.\nJUNO: The one you made such a fuss about.\nACE: Trust me, I’m worth it.\nJUNO: I thought we were all dead a few hours ago.\nMEL: Alonso and Miranda are dead.\nACE: So’s Talpa.\nJUNO: Who’s Talpa? I’ve never heard of him.\nACE: And he’d never heard of you, either. That doesn’t mean he didn’t make a difference.\nACE: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL)\nJUNO: Doctor, is it over?\nDOCTOR: Page 149\nDOCTOR: For Alonso and Miranda, definitely. For Prosper, it’s about to\nDOCTOR: begin all over again.\nMEL: Now you have a chance to get Mogera are completely honest\nJUNO: How can we ever trust them?\nACE: That’s funny, they’re saying\nDOCTOR: The Mogera were only ever as\nMEL: Who also happened to be your\nDOCTOR: it right — so long as you and the with each other from the start.\nDOCTOR: the same thing about you.\nDOCTOR: evil as their leader.\nDOCTOR: leader.\nDOCTOR: We all create our own monsters, Juno.\nJUNO: All right, er... How do we start?\nDOCTOR: That’s for you to decide together.\nJUNO: Aren’t you going to help?\nDOCTOR: No.\nMEL: You know, Doctor, I think we\nDOCTOR: We’re leaving, Mel. Come on.\nJUNO: But... you will be back, won’t\nDOCTOR: Back? Never. Goodbye, Juno.\nDOCTOR: might have some responsibility-\nDOCTOR: Ace, you too.\nDOCTOR: you?\nDOCTOR: MAKER OF DEMONS by Matthew J Elliott (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: SCENE 79: EXT. STREETS OF PROSPER\nACE: WALK.\nMEL: Ace, you talk some sense into him.\nACE: I’m torn over this, Mel. Yeah, on the one hand, we probably should stay on a while, but on the other hand, I think I’ve seen enough of Prosper to last a lifetime — and walked over most of it. And then there’s Talpa...\nMEL: Come on, Doctor, you’ve had time to think.\nDOCTOR: Several centuries, in fact, and it’s still never enough. Ah, the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: THE DOOR OPENS.\nMEL: Couldn’t we at least make a return trip, in another hundred years or so?\nDOCTOR: Not even in a million. I’ve meddled in this planet’s affairs for the last time. Get in, both of you.\nDOCTOR: What’s past is prologue.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
