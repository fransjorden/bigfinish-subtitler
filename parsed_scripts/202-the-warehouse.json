Who’s going to be stupid enough to defy the High Priestess and try to contact the Warehouse?\nDARL: Us, apparently.\nREEF: (STEPPING UP TO AN ALTAR-LIKE DESK) Look, here it is. I told you.

There is nothing to explain. (TO THE ACOLYTES) Bind her.\nREEF: (STRUGGLING) Leave her alone, it’s me you want!\nLYDEK: Reef. You have betrayed your position in Customer Service. (TO ONE OF THE OTHER ACOLYTES) Remove his card.\nLYDEK: You were a loyalty card holder, Reef. Only the chosen few were issued with these. You swore upon the Catalogue to uphold our\nLYDEK: laws. This betrayal cannot go unpunished. Both of you will pay the penalty.\nDARL: But you can’t...!\nREEF: Lydek, please! Darl only went along with it for the sake of her family. For her father!\nLYDEK: Then her family will have to survive without her. The law is clear. The Terminal may not be accessed by any but the appointed servant of the Warehouse. I alone can ask for Delivery. The punishment for what you have done is death. Take them away.\nLYDEK: REEF AND DARL ARE DRAGGED AWAY.\nDARL: No!

RATTLE OF DOOR CATCH AS DOCTOR AND MEL STEP OUT.\nMEL: If this is the Grand Concert Hall of the Megrootii then it’s looking a little past its prime.\nDOCTOR: It would appear that we’ve overshot slightly.\nMEL: So where are we?\nDOCTOR: I’m not entirely sure...\nMEL: It looks like a warehouse of some kind. A very big warehouse. There must be miles of shelves!\nDOCTOR: Miles of shelves and millions of boxes. (FX: CLOSES TARDIS DOOR) Ah well, since we’re here, we might as well have a little look round. (HEADING OFF A FEW PACES)\nMEL: (NOT MOVING FROM HER SPOT) Might we. From the looks of it, no one’s been here for years. It’s dark, dusty and (SNIFFS) something smells decidedly mouldy.\nDOCTOR: Just a quick wander down a few of the aisles, Mel? I’m intrigued.\nMEL: Oh, alright. (WALKING TO JOIN THE DOCTOR) Just as long as we don’t miss that concert! You’ve got me all excited about it now!\nMEL: THE TWO OF THEM SET OFF, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. WE STAY WHERE WE ARE, THEIR VOICES RECEDING.\nDOCTOR: A quick recce, nothing more. I promise.\nCROSS TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 8\nCROSS TO: THE DOCTOR AND MEL’S FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE OVER CCTV — THEY’RE\nBEING: WATCHED ON A MONITOR.\nBEING: ‘BLUP’ OF A WATERCOOLER.\nSUPERVISOR: Interesting... we seem to have intruders in the Warehouse... (SLURPS WATER) Where did you spring from, I wonder?\nMEL: (CCTV) What are they keeping here? What’s it all for?\nDOCTOR: (CCTV) According to the label, these shelves are stacked with... (READING) biscuits.\nCROSS BACK TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 9\nMEL: Who on earth would want this many biscuits? I can’t even see the end of the aisle.\nDOCTOR: (CROSSING TO WALL) Ah! This might shed some light on things.\nMEL: (FOLLOWING) Thank goodness, a map!\nDOCTOR: (READING) Bay E. Section seven. “Biscuits, flour and non- perishable baked goods.”\nMEL: And look, ‘Bays A to Z’. That means there are twenty-five other bays. Each with thousands of different sections!\nDOCTOR: That’s an awful lot of biscuits. Bourbons... Ginger snaps...\nMEL: (READING) Hardware, books and periodicals, furniture, electrical components... This place must be enormous!\nDOCTOR: It does seem to be extraordinarily well-stocked.\nMEL: Well you’d think that they’d keep the place a bit cleaner. It’s hardly very inviting for shoppers. It’s all so gloomy.\nDOCTOR: I think you’ll find that the shopping experience has changed a little since your time, Mel. Whenever we are in your future... I presume that practically everything is done online.\nMEL: Online? You mean orders placed by computer?\nDOCTOR: Precisely! The goods are stored in a central location like this and delivered direct to the shoppers’ homes as requested. By robotic drone most likely.\nMEL: Really? Even things like books? And food?\nDOCTOR: Books, food, furniture, clothes... Pretty much everything.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 10\nMEL: That’s all well and good, but what about the shops on the high street?\nDOCTOR: They’1ll become something of a novelty, I’m afraid. By the mid- 21°* century the high street at Pease Pottage will consist solely of one hundred and seventy three different coffee shops...\nMEL: What? But that’s awful!\nDOCTOR: I agree. It’s almost impossible to get a cup of Earl Grey.\nMEL: That’s not what I meant...\nDOCTOR: It’s progress, Mel. Like it or not, things change. If we took someone from this time back to the 1980s then they would be equally baffled by the way that you do things. You - more than most people - should appreciate how fast technology evolves...\nMEL: I suppose so. I wonder what the world is like outside of this grubby old warehouse.\nDOCTOR: Well, let’s find out. (CROSSING FLOOR; MEL FOLLOWS) That looks like a shuttered window of some kind, wouldn’t you say?\nMEL: Hmm. Maybe it should stay shuttered. Look at the warning sign. (READING) ‘Shield to be kept closed. Atmospheric seals to be checked regularly.’ — ‘Atmospheric’?\nDOCTOR: This keypad must raise the shutter...\nDOCTOR: HE PRESSES A SERIES OF BUTTONS THAT BEEP.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) EMERGENCY INSTRUCTION...

I must say, the view is quite\nDOCTOR: spectacular.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 12\nMEL: We’re in orbit!\nDOCTOR: It makes sense. Place the warehouse in orbit and robotic drones can deliver to every continent on the planet below.\nMEL: Where are they, then — these robotic drones?\nDOCTOR: Yes, we should be able to see them flying in and out of here like busy little bees. Perhaps it’s a bank holiday.\nMEL: Still, at least we’ve got some light now. It’s a proper maze. These shelves really do look like they go on forever!\nDOCTOR: And there’s still that smell of decay...\nMEL: Doctor, this is pretty dull. Why don’t we get on our way to Megrootii?\nDOCTOR: Just a little while longer, Mel, there’s a mystery here, I can feel it. (WALKING) Let’s head down this aisle for a bit. See if we can find a section for Jammy Dodgers.\nMEL: (SIGH) Oh, alright then...\nSHE: FOLLOWS.

You know what he’s like when he gets his head down. He’s determined to get the stocktake of wafers, crackers and savoury snacks complete by the end of this shift. It’s probably just another computer error. (PAUSE) Or vermin...\nSUDDEN: ANN-E: Yes. I suppose it could be the vermin...\nSUDDEN: JEAN-E: Good girl. Now, where were we?

As far as the end of the aisle, you said, and here we are. — There’s nothing here, Doctor. Nothing but more\nMEL: aisles, more biscuits and (SNIFFS) that revolting smell!\nDOCTOR: It does seem to be stronger than before. I wonder what could be causing it?\nMEL: Mouldy digestives, probably. Can’t we just go back to the TARDIS? Please?\nDOCTOR: Just a minute, Mel. — Down that next aisle. At the far end, see?\nMEL: See what? — Point with your umbrella.\nDOCTOR: There!! — Something glowing. Some sort of phosphorescence...\nMEL: (DESPAIRING) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I won’t be a moment.

I knew it. Now, stay close. Step where I step.\nMEL: Don’t you worry. I’m very attached to my extremities!\nMEL: THEY CREEP FORWARD.\nMEL: Urgh! That smell really IS appalling.\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Yes, and I rather think this might be the cause.\nMEL: (COUGHING) What on Earth-?\nDOCTOR: Some sort of phosphorescent mould, I think.\nMEL: It’s all over the packing crates. — Is it me, or is it glowing brighter the closer we get to it?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it seems to be reacting to our presence...\nDOCTOR: SUDDENLY, A LOUD SCRATCHING - CLAWS ON METAL — FROM UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR, CLOSE BY.\nMEL: Are you sure it’s not the only thing reacting to our presence...?\nDOCTOR: Yes.

I wonder...\nCROSS TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 35\nSUPERVISOR: WATCHING VIA CCTV, AS BEFORE.\nMEL: (D) I’d better work out another route, since we can’t go through Bay F?\nMEL: FRED-E: (D) I’1l1 show you on the map.\nSUPERVISOR: Yes, we don’t want you going anywhere near Bay F, do we? — ‘Travellers’. I wonder how you came to be here...?\nSUPERVISOR: BEEP OF COMMUNICATOR.\nSUPERVISOR: All section managers, check all airlocks for sign of unauthorised docking. Report any unidentified spacecraft to me immediately. Supervisor out.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 36\nSUPERVISOR: FADE UP. ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.\nMEL: You know, Doctor — it’s odd. I get the feeling that nothing’s moved from these shelves in a very long time.\nDOCTOR: My thoughts exactly, Mel. Look at the stock level charts (STOPPING) — here, for example.\nMEL: (REALISING) The same quantities, repeated over and over!\nDOCTOR: I’m not convinced anything ever leaves this warehouse. Just an endless stocktake: day after day, month after month, year after year...\nMEL: No wonder the families are starting to go stir crazy!\nDOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Yes...\nMEL: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: There’s that glow again — see? (WALKING OVER)\nMEL: (FOLLOWING) More of that mould. — A lot more, actually...\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Yes, and see how it’s reacting to our presence again.\nMEL: So it’s alive. I mean — properly alive, able to reason in some way.\nDOCTOR: Possibly. I won’t know for sure until I get a sample back to the TARDIS for analysis. I need to find a container of some kind. (PASSING UMBRELLA) Hold my umbrella for me, will you?\nMEL: I don’t know why you’re still hanging onto it. As an umbrella it’s pretty much useless, now.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR: (LOOKING OVER SHELVES) Yes, perhaps it is time for a new one.\nMEL: Maybe they’1ll have one in stock here?\nDOCTOR: Ah! (TAKING TIN FROM SHELF) This looks promising...\nMEL: A tin of shortbread?\nDOCTOR: To put my sample in?\nTIN: LID REMOVED; RUSTLE OF A WRAPPER.\nMEL: Doctor! You can’t keep all that shortbread in your pocket.\nDOCTOR: Waste not, want not, Mel. (PATTING POCKETS) Now. I should have a spoon in here somewhere... (FINDING SPOON) .. a-ha!\nMEL: You and your spoons.\nDOCTOR: (SPOONING MOULD INTO TIN) I’11l just take a very small sample... There. (PUTS LID ON)\nSIMULTANEOUSLY: — DISTANT SQUEALING, SCAMPERING ‘ALIEN RAT’ FEET.\nMEL: (NERVOUSLY) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I hear it, Mel. The patter of clawed feet.\nJOINED: BY OTHERS — A WHOLE PACK.\nMEL: The patter of LOTS of clawed feet. And coming this way.\nDOCTOR: Quickly — which way do we need to go?\nMEL: According to Fred-E’s map — the direction that those things are coming from.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: Then we’ve no choice. We’ll have to take the more direct route.\nMEL: Through Bay F?\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nMEL: And the rogue family unit?\nDOCTOR: Let’s worry about them when we get there. Come on!\nDOCTOR: THEY RACE OFF, PURSUED BY SQUEALING ALIEN RATS.\nCROSSFADE TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR: & MEL RUN TO HALT. RATS STILL SOME WAY BEHIND.\nDOCTOR: There it is. Bay F.\nMEL: But it’s sealed. Doctor, how are we going to get in?\nDOCTOR: You know what they say, Mel, the bigger they are...\nMEL: The harder they are to open?\nDOCTOR: Not when I’ve still got my spoon. — Let’s see now... (BEGINS\nJABBING: DOOR LOCK WITH SPOON)\nEXCITED: SQUEALING, OFF.\nMEL: There must be hundreds of those things! — Whatever you’re trying to do, Doctor, you’d better hurry.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) I am hurrying... This lock is tricky to trip.\nMEL: (PANICKED NOW) Doctor!\nCOMPUTER: (OVER) Fire. Door... Door... Fire door opening.\nCOMPUTER: HISS OF HYDRAULICS.\nMEL: I knew you could do it!\nDOCTOR: That wasn’t me. It’s being opened from the other side.\nSQUEALING: MUCH CLOSER NOW. DOOR COMES TO A HALT. BEHIND:\nSQUEALING: FRED-F: Stand still, both of you.\nDOCTOR: Fred-e? Jean-e? What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 40\nMEL: Why are you armed?\nMEL: JEAN-F: Fred, they must be infected.\nMEL: Fred-E, it’s us! Melanie and the Doctor...\nMEL: FRED-F: I said, stay where you are!\nMEL: But those rat-things behind — they’1l be here any second!\nMEL: FRED-F : Then we can deal with two problems at once. — Prime the flamethrower, Jean. We’ll have to incinerate them.\nMEL: JEAN-F: With pleasure.\nFLAMETHROWER: BURSTS INTO LIFE — WHOMPF!\nMEL: No!\nDOCTOR: Wait!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 41"

We’ll have to incinerate them.\nMEL: JEAN-F: With pleasure.\nFLAMETHROWER: BURSTS INTO LIFE — WHOMPF!\nMEL: No!\nDOCTOR: Wait!\nDOCTOR: Don’t be a fool, man.

They could be the relief team...\nALIEN: RATS NOW VERY CLOSE — SQUEALING TRIUMPHANTLY.\nDOCTOR: You’ve got to let us in and close this door!\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (MAKING A DECISION) Alright.

Who are you?\nMEL: You really don’t have the faintest idea who we are, do you?\nMEL: FRED-F: I’ve never seen you either of you before in my life.\nDOCTOR: Whereas Mel and I have very definitely met you, Jeannie and Annie.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: In the previous section?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 43\nMEL: Yes.\nMEL: ANN-F: Then that was family unit E. We’re unit F. Fred-F, Jean-F..\nMEL: (REALISING) .. and Ann-F!\nMEL: ANN-F: Yes, but you can just call me Ann. I never liked F as a surname.\nDOCTOR: You’re clones, then — all of you? Fascinating...\nMEL: Doctor, I don’t understand.\nMEL: FRED-F: It’s simple enough. There are twenty-six cloned family units in the Warehouse, one per bay.\nMEL: No, I get that. It’s just — Fred-E; the other Fred... he told us that you Fs had gone rogue!\nMEL: FRED-F: (LAUGHS) Really? Well, he would have.\nMEL: ANN-F: He’s infected, you see.\nDOCTOR: Infected?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: By the mould.\nDOCTOR: SCRATCHING AND SQUEALING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.

Do you have any idea what they are?\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: A menace is what they are. Between them and the mould, it’s no wonder that we’re so behind with the stocktake.\nDOOR: CLOSES.\nMEL: You all seem obsessed with this stocktake.\nMEL: ANN-F: But of course. It’s what we were designed to do.\nMEL: Designed?\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) Yes... That’s why you’re all clones, isn’t it? So that you all work in exactly the same way. All to the same routine.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (CHEERFULLY) That’s right.\nMEL: But what do you do when you’re not doing the stocktake?\nMEL: JEAN-F: Maintenance. Security. Cleaning up after the mould, and the vermin...\nMEL: No, I mean when you’re not working. In your spare time.\nMEL: FRED-F:\nMEL: ‘Spare time’? Do you realise how much work there is to do here? It was bad enough before, but now that we’re shut off from the other sections...\nDOCTOR: Yes, why is that? You mentioned a contagion...\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (GETTING AGITATED) The others. They’re infected. They’re not to be trusted!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: JEAN-F: Gently, Fred... Remember your blood pressure...\nDOCTOR: FRED-F:\nDOCTOR: It’s the mould. Anyone in prolonged contact with it.. changes. It hides inside them, in the brain, growing, controlling... Shut it out, it’s the only way!\nDOCTOR: And that’s what you’ve done. Shut it out?\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: Yes.\nDOCTOR: (THOUGHTFULLY) How long have you been on your own in here?\nDOCTOR: JEAN-F: It must be well over a year, now...\nMEL: (SHOCKED) A year?\nDOCTOR: Then I think that this has gone on long enough. We saw no sign of any infection. And Fred-E would hardly have sent us to repair the computer if...\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (INTERRUPTING) Repair the computer?\nDOCTOR: Computers are Mel’s speciality.\nMEL: Although looking around here... what Fred-E failed to mention is that this section seems to contain everything I’1l need to repair it!\nMEL: ANN-F: Bay F: electrical hardware and light industrial.\nDOCTOR: Hence the flamethrower...\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (FIRM) No.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: I said no! If Fred-E wants you to repair the computer, then he’s up to something, he must be...!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (DESPAIRING) Dad...\nSUPERVISOR: (TANNOY) Would the manager of Bay F please contact the supervisor’s office immediately.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F: (WORRIED) Fred...\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: That’s all I need. (BEAT) Lock these two up.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: Dad, no. This is crazy!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: I said lock them up!\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F : Where?\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: Aisle four thousand, three hundred and seven, of course! It’s got a security cage.\nMEL: A cage?\nMEL: FRED-F: For high-value items. I’d say you qualify.\nMEL: Look here, we’re trying to help!\nMEL: JEAN-F: Come on, you two.\nMEL: AS THEY’RE BUSTLED AWAY:\nDOCTOR: This is absurd!\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (GRIMLY, TO SELF) Now to see what our beloved Supervisor wants.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR: FADE UP. MEL RATTLES INSIDE OF MESH CAGE.\nMEL: (SIGHS) Locked up again!\nDOCTOR: An occupational hazard, I’m afraid. Still, at least we won’t starve to death. (FX: WRAPPER) Shortbread?\nMEL: Thank you. (BITES, THEN FLINCHES) Gah, it’s like rock!\nDOCTOR: It does seem past its best, rather.\nMEL: Great. — What do you think, Doctor? Is there a contagion here, or has Fred-F just gone barmy?\nDOCTOR: The answer to that... is in here. (FX: TAPS TIN)\nMEL: Your tin of mould? Until we can get back to the TARDIS to analyse it — it’s not a fat lot of use, is it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know, Mel. Look around you.\nMEL: (WEARILY) More shelves.\nDOCTOR: Shelves packed with electrical hardware...\nMEL: ‘High-value items...’ (SUSPICIOUS) What have you got in mind? Something to break us out of this cage?\nDOCTOR: What? And waste an opportunity to learn something about this mould? No. We’re going to build ourselves an analysing scanner!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 49\nSUPERVISOR: (D) Fred? Fred-F, my boy, are you there?\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: I’m here. What do you want?\nSUPERVISOR: (D) Is that any way to speak to your Supervisor?\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: I said, what do you want?\nSUPERVISOR: (D) Very well, if we’re dispensing with the social niceties... There are two people, two strangers, that you’re holding prisoner.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: I am, yes.\nSUPERVISOR: (D; EXASPERATED) You really are a most tiresome boy. They’re here to help! The girl claims to be able to repair the computer. That’s what we all want, isn’t it? To get things back to normal.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: If you want them to repair the computer... then you’re up to something.\nSUPERVISOR: (D) Up to something? Fred-F, my dear, you’re so suspicious. Now, you really must listen to me. I’m your Supervisor...\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: No. No, you’re not. Not any more at any rate. You’ve been infected. Like the rest of them.\nSUPERVISOR: (D; HARDENING) This has gone far enough. Release them!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: No.\nSUPERVISOR: (D) Fred-F, that’s an ord—\nCOMMUNICATOR: CUT OFF.

Are you sure about this? Ann thinks..she thinks we should let the strangers try to help.\nCOMMUNICATOR: FRED-F: Well, Ann’s wrong! They’re infected, Jean. All of them. I know it...!\nCOMMUNICATOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: (PROUDLY) There, Mel — that’s what you get when you cross a video camera with a cholesterol tester, a pair of electronic scales, a laser pointer and a telescope!\nMEL: Yes — one almighty mess. But will it work?\nDOCTOR: Of course it will! Switch on, would you?\nDIFFERENT: BLEEPS FROM VARIOUS SMALL ITEMS.\nMEL: Well? Does it work?\nDOCTOR: Of course it works! — Look at this, it’s fascinating..!\nMEL: Budge up then. (THE DOCTOR GETS OUT OF THE WAY & MEL LOOKS THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER) Hmm. You’1ll have to tell me what I’m looking at. Computer science is my area, not microbiology.\nDOCTOR: This mould is an incredibly complex organism. And Fred-F was right, it seems to have a structure that would allow it to interface with an animal nervous system. See those little wavy hairs? They help it latch onto animal cells.\nMEL: Delightful. So he’s right? The others are infected?\nDOCTOR: Possibly.\nMEL: Doctor — are we safe? With that sample, I mean?\nDOCTOR: It seems inert at the moment. But if we were to stimulate ita little...\nCROSS TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 52\nMEL: (CCTV) I’m not so sure that’s a good idea...\nDOCTOR: (CCTV) Brave heart, Mel. The more we can learn about this mould, the better. Turn the power up a notch.\nMEL: (CCTV) Well, if you’re sure...\nOVER: CCTV — RISING POWER.\nSUPERVISOR: Ohh, you’re clever, you are, Doctor. Too clever by half...!\nCROSS BACK TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: There, see — it’s glowing again!\nSOFT: BUBBLING-CRACKLING FROM MOULD... GROWING STRONGER.\nMEL: (NERVOUSLY) More than just glowing. It seems to be growing. Take a look!\nDOCTOR: (LOOKING IN THE VIEWFINDER) Yes, it does seem to be reacting to something.\nMEL: Whatever it is that you’re doing, it might be time to stop.\nDOCTOR: Mel!\nPOWER: CUT. CRACKLE CONTINUES.\nMEL: It’s not making any difference. It’s already twice the size it was!\nDOCTOR: Get back, Mel. Find something to cover your nose and mouth.\nMEL: We’ve got to get out of here!\nMEL: ANN-F :\nMEL: What have you done with the stock?\nDOCTOR: Ah, Ann-F! I wonder, could you open this cage?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : Those items had all been counted. We’1ll have to start all over — (NOTICING) Is that mould? It is!\nMEL: (FRANTIC) Open the cage!\nKEYPAD: BEEP. RATTLE AS CAGE DOOR SLIDES OPEN.\nKEYPAD: ANN-F: Both of you, out! Quickly!\nKEYPAD: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 54\nKEYPAD: DOCTOR AND MEL SCRAMBLE OUT.

About the others being infected...?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: He’s been under so much pressure, what with the mould... the vermin... the computer problems...\nMEL: Then let us help you. Get us out of here so we can fix the computer!\nDOCTOR: Ann — if vital systems like life support were to fail...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: I know. (STOPS) Yes. Yes, alright.\nDOCTOR: Splendid!

On my own?\nDOCTOR: You’re more than capable. With luck Fred-E will have informed his clone in Bay G that you’re coming. See what you can do with that computer.\nMEL: Why? Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: I have an urge to take a quick trip down to the planet below.\nMEL: What on Earth for?\nDOCTOR: I want to find out why there’s been no contact with them. Why these poor people have been abandoned in orbit.\nMEL: By abandoning me in orbit, too!\nDOCTOR: We have to find out what’s going on here, Mel. Splitting up will get the job done quicker.\nMEL: Alright, Doctor. If you’re sure.\nDOCTOR: Just... be careful, Mel.\nMEL: (HEADING OFF) Don’t worry, I will.\nDOCTOR: Now then, Ann-F.

The Warehouse.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: It looks like a huge halo.\nDOCTOR: It does, rather. The trouble is: if the Warehouse is in a geo- stationary orbit directly above us, then we should be standing in a thriving metropolis.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: So what’s happened?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure.

The rusted remains of motor vehicles.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: This used to be a city!\nDOCTOR: Undoubtedly.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: But — where are all the people? What happened to them?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Something terrible, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : But what?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure... but whatever it was, it wasn’t recent. (BEAT) You’ve been up there in orbit a long time, haven’t you?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: We clones were designed to be long-lived. We tend to lose track of the years.\nDOCTOR: I know the feeling. But it doesn’t explain why you were left up there with no contact.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Come on.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: Well — if there are buildings, they might contain records of some kind.

But why would they want to attack a computer?\nMEL: FRED-G: We don’t know.\nMEL: JEAN-G:\nMEL: We think they got in through the cable ducting.

Three crescents, clustered together...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: A biohazard symbol!\nDOCTOR: That, and the yellow ribbons over every interior doorway. The black print’s long faded, of course, but all told, it’s indicative of disease. A viral outbreak of some kind. Perhaps this was a hospital...?\nDOCTOR: ANN-E: Oh no...\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Of course! That’s why the Warehouse is in orbit!

Doctor — did we come this way earlier...?\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t believe we did.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: So who made those footprints, on the path ahead?\nDOCTOR: Good question, Ann-F. Here’s another: who made the path? —A path leading up to a particular long, low structure...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: See? There ARE still people alive here! (DASHING OFF) Come on!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER) Ann, slow down!\nCROSSFADE TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 74\nSWING: DOORS PUSHED OPEN, AS BEFORE.\nSWING: ANN-F: (DISAPPOINTED) There’s no one here.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING UP BEHIND) Good. That means that we have time to work out how we’re going to introduce ourselves properly.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: What was this place, do you suppose?\nDOCTOR: Once? The loading bay of a superstore, perhaps. Judging by the way that altar has been garlanded with flowers, now it’s become some kind of temple. Only instead of an idol on the altar...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: . it’s a computer terminal.\nDOCTOR: THEY RUSH FORWARD TO ALTAR.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Doctor — it’s exactly the same as the terminals in the Warehouse. That can’t be a coincidence!\nDOCTOR: TAPS AT KEYBOARD.\nTERMINAL: (FLICKERY, FAINT) Please... place your order.\nTERMINAL: ANN-F: It’s still working!\nDOCTOR: Solar cells keep the terminal going. But with the communications gone, it can’t connect to the Warehouse mainframe. (TURNING) I might have something back in the TARDIS to... (SEES SOMETHING) Oh.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Turn around.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (TURNING) What is it?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: Above the door. The mural.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : That’s the Warehouse!\nDOCTOR: And hanging in space above the Warehouse, is...?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : No! But that’s...!\nDOCTOR: Not quite Michelangelo, perhaps, but I think the likenesses are rather good, don’t you? Fred, Jean... and yourself, Ann. All giant size.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: But if this place is a temple of some kind...\nDOCTOR: Then you and your clone family are being revered as deities.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 76\nMEL: Three hundred and fifty years, that’s impossible!\nMEL: FRED-G: Not really. We clones come with a five-hundred-year guarantee.\nMEL: And all you’ve done in all that time is stocktake?!\nMEL: ANN-G: Well, yes. It’s what we were designed to do.\nMEL: You said. Don’t you ever get bored, you Gs? Don’t you wish that you had a life beyond this?\nMEL: JEAN-G: Doing what?\nMEL: I don’t know. Reading books? Watching films? Interacting with other family units?\nMEL: ANN-G: But we’re not programmed for that.\nMEL: JEAN-G: You feel sorry for us, because you think we have desires like yours. But we don’t, and that’s that.\nMEL: It’s horrible. Cruel and horrible.\nMEL: ANN-G: Do you think asking that computer to run a system diagnostic is horrible? Or to ask it open a door, or turn on a light?\nMEL: But that’s completely different!\nMEL: ANN-G: Isn’t it just a matter of perspective? It’s a machine designed to do a job of work.\nMEL: FRED-G: Exactly. We clones — we’re just organic machines, designed for one purpose.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 77\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Movement detected. Section nine. Aisle eight thousand and thirty three. Damage to coolant pipes.\nCOMPUTER: FRED-G:\nCOMPUTER: Blasted vermin again! Come on, Jean. (TO MEL) Look, Melan-E: if you really want to help us, you just carry on with those repairs.\nMEL: But —\nFRED: & JEAN EXIT. DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES.\nFRED: ANN-G: You really don’t have to worry about us, Mel. We’re perfectly happy — Mum, Dad and me.\nMEL: But only because you’re programmed not to notice that you’re un-happy. (BEAT) Well — if fixing this computer will help, then that’s what I’m going to do. Come on, let’s see if we can get some this wiring back into some kind of order...\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR: Over here, Ann-F — take a look at this.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (WALKING OVER) What is it?\nDOCTOR: Writing on the pillars either side of the mural.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F:\nDOCTOR: (READING) “Deliver unto us bread and meat... Deliver unto us warm clothing... Deliver unto us weapons for the hunt...” What is it, a prayer of some kind?\nDOCTOR: Not a prayer. A list.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : A list?\nDOCTOR: A shopping list. Every line on these pillars is an order, placed with the Gods — placed with you, Fred and Jean!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Stop it Doctor! We’re not Gods!\nDOCTOR: To the people who built this temple you are. Hanging in the skies, with a warehouseful of unimaginable bounty...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: You mean — they worship us?\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY, TO HIMSELF) A cargo cult.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : A what?\nDOCTOR: It’s a cargo cult. I saw something similar on the planet Earth, in the early twentieth century. The inhabitants of the Melanesian islands came to believe that ritualistic acts would bring them material wealth.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR: The Melanesian islanders were first-hand witnesses to a war fought by two great technological nations. When they saw cargo planes delivering food and equipment to the troops, they thought the gods were delivering wealth from the sky — and began worshipping them in the hope that they, too, would be blessed with supplies.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: And you think that’s what has happened here?\nDOCTOR: It would make sense. Everything that this society needs to repair itself has been hanging in plain sight for hundreds of years. But all their attempts to communicate have failed.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: So if Mel repairs the computer...\nDOCTOR: Then I guess that this terminal, and hundreds of others like it, will start working again, and the drones will start delivering.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: So let’s get back to the Warehouse, and help Mel!\nDOCTOR: It’s not as simple as that. From the look of this place, hundreds of years have gone by. The survivors started out civilised, but in the intervening centuries — well, who knows how low they might have s—[unk] (TRAILING OFF) Ah.\nSIMULTANEOUSLY: 4 x ACOLYTES APPROACHING FROM OUTSIDE, HAULING\nLYDEK: INTO THE TEMPLE. WE CANT YET HEAR CLEARLY WHAT THEY’RE CHANTING, BUT IT GOES LIKE THIS:\nLYDEK: 4 X ACOLYTES: (CHANTING) Danger, vehicle reversing. Danger, vehicle reversing. [ETC]\nLYDEK: ANN-F: (EXCITED) Survivors!\nDOCTOR: Approaching the Temple. Quick, behind the pillars!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : Shouldn’t we introduce ourselves?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: (IMPATIENT) And what will you tell them, Ann-F? ‘Hello, I’m one of the Gods you’ve been worshipping. Sorry we’ve been ignoring you all these centuries, but we thought we’d just drop by to see how you’re doing?’\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Yes, you might have a point.\nDOCTOR: Besides, look at where we are. In my experience - which is painfully extensive - the faithful tend to get a bit touchy when you intrude upon their holy of holies without permission. Now ssh!\nSWING: DOORS CRASH OPEN. ACOLYTES GRUNT WITH EFFORT AS THEY PULL\nLYDEK: INTO THE TEMPLE ON TOP OF A CAR CHASSIS. NOW WE HEAR\nTHEIR CHANT CLEARLY: 4 X ACOLYTES: (CHANTING) Danger, vehicle reversing. Danger, vehicle reversing. [ETC]\nDOORS: SWING SHUT.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Fascinating.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (SOTTO) What is it they’re bringing that woman in on?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) The remains of a goods vehicle of some kind. Four acolytes pulling a four by four.\nCHANTING: STOPS AS LYDEK IS SET DOWN.\nLYDEK: Loyal Service Assistants, we are gathered once again to beg the Gods for Delivery! To fill the sky with the soft drone of angels!\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 81\nCOMPUTERY: NOISES.\nMEL: (CURSING) Oh, rats!\nMEL: ANN-G: (ALARMED) Vermin? Here!\nMEL: No, Ann-G — that’s not what I meant. Sorry. Not the best choice of curse, in the circumstances.\nMEL: ANN-G: Well, what’s wrong?\nMEL: This logic board, that’s what’s wrong.\nMEL: ANN-G: It’s broken?\nMEL: Completely. Most of the other damage can be repaired, but there’s nothing I can do with this. It’s going to have to be completely replaced.\nMEL: ANN-G: There must be a spare, somewhere in the Warehouse.\nMEL: Oh, I’m sure there is.\nMEL: ANN-G: Well then, what’s the problem?\nMEL: All the computer spares... They’re in Bay F.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 82\nACOLYTE: #1: Stop the ceremony!\nLYDEK: You forget yourself, Acolyte!\nACOLYTE: #1: High Priestess. There has been a blasphemy!\nLYDEK: Explain!\nACOLYTE: #1: The terminal has been disturbed. Someone has tried to send a request...\nLYDEK: (CROSSING TO THE ACOLYTE; SHOCKED) Another blasphemy! Will\nLYDEK: these heresies never cease? — When?\nKEYBOARD: CLATTER.\nTERMINAL: Please... place your order.\nACOLYTE: #1: Within the last few minutes.\nLYDEK: Then the blasphemers could still be somewhere inside the temple.

Stay here, Ann-F.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (WH) What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Talk to them. Try to explain.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (SOTTO) They’ve got spears!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Stay here. (STEPS OUT FROM HIDING, COUGHS LOUDLY) Good\nDOCTOR: afternoon.\nACOLYTE: #1: Priestess! A blasphemer!\nLYDEK: Seize him!\nACOLYTES: RUSH FORWARD TO GRAB DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: Alright, alright. (GRABBED) There’s no need to be so heavy- handed.\nLYDEK: (APPROACHING) I do not know you. Who are you?\nDOCTOR: A traveller. My name’s the Doctor. I’m here to help.\nLYDEK: Did you defile the terminal?\nDOCTOR: I was seeing if I could establish a link with the Warehouse.\nLYDEK: (SHOCKED) So you freely admit your guilt!\nDOCTOR: If you would just let me explain...\nLYDEK: What is there to explain? You are a stranger who has defiled our temple. Service Assistants — raise your spears! And put this blasphemer to death!\nDOCTOR: What-? No!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 84"

This one, I presume, has been loaded with the knowledge needed to programme a clone workforce to rebuild this civilisation. — Am I right, Lydek?\nLYDEK: Your words are strange, but I think I understand your meaning. The Oracle was built by our ancestors. It contains the history of our people.\nDOCTOR: I’m right, then. May I-?\nDOCTOR: PRESSES A FEW BUTTONS. VERY FAINT ‘TICKING OVER’.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Well?\nDOCTOR: It’s barely working. Like the Terminal in the temple, the solar cells have all but disintegrated.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 97\nLYDEK: We try to keep the wisdom of the Oracle alive, passing it down from High Priestess to High Priestess. But every generation, the voice of the Oracle becomes harder to hear...\nDOCTOR: I’m amazed that the telepathic generators have run as long as they have...\nLYDEK: But there is another way to access its voice. A secret shown to me by my mother, and her mother before her.\nLYDEK: ANN-F : How?\nLYDEK: With prayer.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nLYDEK: And a special powder.\nDOCTOR: What ‘powder’?\nLYDEK: I shall show you.\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 98\nLYDEK: JEAN-G & MEL SEARCHING SHELVES.\nLYDEK: JEAN-G: Mel. Up there. Top shelf, three along. Is that it?\nMEL: The logic board. At last! We’re lucky. It looks like there’s only one left in stock!\nMEL: JEAN-G: I’1l climb up and get it, then we can get out of here. (STEPS\nONTO: METAL LADDER)\nMEL: Hurry! Now that the gas has cleared, I’m worried that getting out of here isn’t going to be as easy as getting in...\nMEL: JEAN-G: (UP LADDER) Got it!\nUNDERFLOOR: SCRATCHING AGAIN.\nMEL: Come on. Those rat-things seem more determined than ever.\nMEL: JEAN-G: (UP LADDER) Just changing the stock level card to zero.\nMEL: (INCREDULOUS) Jean! Leave it!\nMEL: JEAN-G: I can’t. It goes against my programming. It’1ll only take a [moment...]\nHUGE: RENDING AS THE ‘RATS’ TEAR THROUGH FLOOR. SHRIEK-SQUEALING\nMEL: They’re coming through! Dozens of them! Jean — help!\nMEL: JEAN-G: Climb the ladder, Mel!\nMEL: (STARTS TO CLIMB, BUT IS ATTACKED) Aaaah! One’s got my leg! Jean!\nMEL: JEAN-G: (BESIDE) I — I don’t...\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 99\nMEL: That fire extinguisher! Quickly!\nJEAN: TAKES A COUPLE OF STEPS DOWN THE LADDER.\nJEAN: JEAN-G: (PULLING EXTINGUISHER OFF WALL — EFFORT) Got it! Here.\nMEL: I can’t take it. If I loosen my grip, I’11l be pulled down. Spray it at them!\nMEL: JEAN-G: (WRESTLING WITH PIN) The pin’s stiff!\nMEL: Hurry, Jean..! They’re coming along the shelves now!\nMEL: JEAN-G: (STRIKES PIN) Got it!\nHUGE: ‘WHOOSH’ OF CO2. ‘RATS’ RUN OFF, SQUEALING.\nHUGE: JEAN-G: (DROPS FIRE EXTINGUISHER, CLIMBS DOWN THE LADDER) Mel? Are you alright? Did they bite you?\nMEL: No. No, I’m fine. There’s not a scratch on me. — It’s almost as if...\nMEL: JEAN-G:; What?\nMEL: As if they didn’t want to hurt me. What did you do with that logic board?\nMEL: JEAN-G: I put down on the shelf when... (REALISATION) It’s gone!\nMEL: That’s why they attacked me! To distract us.\nMEL: JEAN-G: The vermin? But what would they want with a computer component?\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 100\nMEL: Why did they attack the computer in the first place? (THEY BOTH CLIMB THE REMAINING FEW RUNGS DOWN THE LADDER TO THE FLOOR) I’ve a feeling there’s far more to these creatures than meets the [eye.]\nMEL: FRED-F: (DISTANT) Where are they?\nMEL: JEAN-G: Ssh, Mel!\nMEL: JEAN-F: (DISTANT) I think that I heard something down here...\nMEL: (SOTTO) We’d better get out of here.\nMEL: JEAN-G: (SOTTO) Not that way! Bay G is the other direction.\nMEL: (SOTTO) We’re not going back to Bay G. We’re going into the service ducts after those rats!\nMEL: JEAN-G: (SOTTO) You want to follow the vermin?\nMEL: (SOTTO) There’s not much point in going back if we don’t have that component. And besides, I want to find out a bit more about our rodent friends.\nMEL: CLANG, EFFORT AS MEL SHIFTS RENT FLOOR PANEL.\nMEL: FRED-F: (DISTANT) I can hear voices. They’re this way!\nMEL: (CLIMBING THROUGH HOLE IN FLOOR) Quickly, Jean! With luck they’1l think we’re heading back the other way, and won’t think of looking down here.\nMEL: JEAN-G: You’re right, they won’t. Who in their right mind would climb into ducts full of deadly vermin?\nMEL: I’m not so sure about ‘deadly’. Come on, follow me.\nEFFORT: AS THEY SCRAMBLE INTO DUCT BELOW.\nEFFORT: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 101\nEFFORT: ANN-F: (SOTTO) Look at her. Incense and candles and bowls of powder. All to access a computer?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Fascinating, isn’t it? Mysticism and technology all jumbled up.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (SOTTO) But how can it possibly work?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I once witnessed something similar, among a lost tribe of the Amazon. I’m guessing that the chemicals in the smoke open up the neural pathways of whoever breathes it, allowing the weak telepathic signal being generated by the computer to connect.\nLYDEK: (ALOUD) It is ready. We can begin.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: (SOTTO) Good luck, Doctor.\nLYDEK: Breathe in the smoke, prophet. Let it open your mind.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Maybe breathe more shallowly?\nDOCTOR: Thank you for your valuable advice. (INHALES)\nLYDEK: Yes, yes! Let the vapours seep into you. (DOCTOR’S POV — HER\nVOICE: BECOMING DISTANT AND ECHOEY) Oracle of the people, reveal the past to this prophet. Reveal to him your secrets...\nECHO INTO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 102\nECHO INTO: 57. MONTAGE [DOCTOR’S POV]\nTRIPPY: JUMBLE OF ECHOING, OVERLAPPING VOICES — ORIGINALLY TV\nNEWS: REPORTS, OR RADIO INTERVIEWS.\nVOICE: #1:\nVOICE: [The Branheely] Expedition to the uncharted sub-continent returned today announcing a key discovery, [and a new scientific breakthrough... ]\nVOICE: #2: A new variety of fungus thought to have unique medical properties.\nVOICE: #3:\nVOICE: [The] natives claim that the fungus grew on fragments of rock that fell to earth in their settlement during the meteor showers that lit up our skies [nearly three years ago. ]\nVOICE: #1: [Early tests] show a remarkable ability for the refined fungus to treat a wide range of ailments, [some of them serious. ]\nVOICE: #2:\nVOICE: [The first of] the patients to be treated with drugs derived from the new Branheely fungus has died in what authorities are describing as unusual circumstances.\nVOICE: #3: [There have now been] three more unexplained deaths [in the space of three days. ]\nVOICE: #1:\nVOICE: [There is still] no official word regarding the spate of deaths that have rocked the city, but rumours persist of plans being put in place to deal with a [major emergency. ]\nVOICE: #2:\nVOICE: All citizens are being advised to stay indoors, to keep the doors and windows sealed, and only to go out [if absolutely necessary. ]\nVOICE: #3:\nVOICE: Launches to the space station are continuing, with no official explanation given for this unprecedented number of orbital missions. [Scientists from the space facility...]\nVOICE: #1: [We’re hearing reports of] shots being fired.\nVOICE: #2: Several officers have been badly injured.\nVOICE: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 103\nVOICE: #3: [Government sources claim that] martial law has become unenforceable.\nVOICE: #1:\nVOICE: [We’re getting reports of] several huge explosions at the launch site. Witnesses claim that shuttles are being deliberately destroyed by the military.\nVOICE: #2: [It’s now] estimated that over sixty per cent of the population has been infected.\nVOICE: #3: “Only by isolating those still unaffected can we prevent the plague from spreading.”\nVOICE: #1: (WEAKER, DESPERATE) .. no contact with the Warehouse for nearly ten years now...\nVOICE: #2: (WEAKER, DESPERATE) Please, if there’s anyone still alive up there, we need help...\nVOICE: #3: (WEAKER, DESPERATE) Help us...!\nTERMINAL: Contact failed... contact failed... contact failed...\nECHO BACK INTO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 104\nECHO BACK INTO: ANN-F: Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor, wake up!\nDOCTOR: (GROANS, COMING ROUND) Ohhh...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Are you OK?\nDOCTOR: (GROGGILY) My head...!\nLYDEK: The feeling will pass.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: What did you see?\nDOCTOR: A whole civilisation destroyed... by a fungus.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Fungus?\nDOCTOR: It all but wiped out the inhabitants of this planet.\nLYDEK: We who survived are clear of the infection. As is our world. But it took time.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. You waited it out in shelters like these. But it took hundreds of years. By the time the survivors emerged, they'd been cut off from the supplies sent up into orbit, to help them reclaim the planet.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : In the Warehouse!\nDOCTOR: Isolated in orbit, in the hope that those vital supplies would remain uncontaminated. (SUDDENLY URGENT) We have to get back there right now.\nLYDEK: (CONCERNED) You are returning to the Warehouse...?\nDOCTOR: We must stop Mel from repairing the computer!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: But why? What’s wrong?\nDOCTOR: That machine - the Oracle - it showed me everything: the analysis of the fungus they found, the genetic codes the scientists inserted to try and turn it into a wonder drug...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: So?\nDOCTOR: The results are exactly the same as the analysis I performed on the mould. It DID reach the Warehouse. The fungus up there is the same as the one they had here. If Mel repairs the computer, and it starts to deliver its supplies... this entire planet will be re-infected!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR: JEAN AND MEL CRAWLING THROUGH NARROW METAL DUCTS.\nDOCTOR: JEAN-G: Slow down a minute, Mel. Your hips are narrower than mine!\nMEL: My hair’s bigger than yours though! Sorry, let’s rest fora bit. (BEAT) This is as much of a maze as the shelving!\nMEL: JEAN-F: We must be a long way from Bay F by now. I think we must be getting towards the centre of the Warehouse.\nMEL: (SNIFFS) Urgh. There’s that smell again - if anything, it’s even stronger here.\nMEL: JEAN-G: The mould, yes. There must be a concentration of it nearby.\nMEL: Demented computers. Vermin. Mould. To think I was meant to be sat in a grand concert hall, listening to opera, sipping a nice glass of something chilled...!\nMEL: A VOICE BOOMS OUT FROM AHEAD.\nSUPERVISOR: (OFF) Ohh, that sounds splendid...!\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: (RECOGNITION) Oh my life...!\nMEL: (SOTTO) That came from up ahead! (ALOUD) Who’s there?\nSUPERVISOR: (OFF) There’s an exit point close by. Please, come and say hello. I don’t get that many visitors. I think the smell puts them off...\nMEL: (TO JEAN) Who is that?\nMEL: JEAN-G: Mel, that’s the Supervisor!\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR: Lydek. You must get us back to the surface. I’ve got to reach my TARDIS as soon as possible.\nLYDEK: TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: My ship. The means by which we travelled here.\nLYDEK: You were not delivered by angels?\nDOCTOR: No. You see, we’re.. Well, it’s like this... (GIVES UP) Listen, Lydek, we’re not Gods, okay?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: We’re just people. Like you.\nLYDEK: But... the Catalogue says that you stride amongst the goods, able to reach the highest shelves.\nDOCTOR: Do Ann and I look like we could reach the uppermost shelves of\nDOCTOR: anything? (SIGHS) Lydek, I wish that there was an easier way to do this, but there is no time. There is nothing mystical about\nDOCTOR: the Warehouse. It’s just a place, and the people inside it are\nDOCTOR: just that: people. Trapped and isolated, just like you.\nLYDEK: No... It can’t be possible... Such talk is blasphemous. (REALIZING) Ah, you seek to test the Loyalty of our cards! You shall not find me wanting in points.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: No, Lydek.\nDOCTOR: (PLEADING) You must trust us. Your people have spent three hundred years sending requests via the terminal. If the computer starts to fulfil those orders... nowhere on this planet will be safe.\nLYDEK: Where is your... ‘ship’?\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR: In the jungle, on the edge of a hill overlooking the city. It’s the only bare spot for miles.\nLYDEK: The Scar. I know the place. (PAUSE) Very well. I will take you there.\nDOCTOR: (RELIEF) Thank you.\nLYDEK: But you must take me with you. To the Warehouse. If you want me to believe, I need to see with my own eyes. (STRIDING OFF) Come!\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Whatever happened to ‘proof denies faith’?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 109\nEFFORT: AS MEL & JEAN-G CLIMB OUT OF DUCT.\nSUPERVISOR: There you are. See, I told you there was an exit. Here, take my hand.\nMEL: Thank you. (HELPED OUT OF THE DUCT) So, you’re the Supervisor? What, for the whole Warehouse?\nSUPERVISOR: That’s me.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: (AWED) He’s in charge of everything here.\nSUPERVISOR: I do my best, Jean-G. My very best...!\nMEL: Are you a clone too?\nSUPERVISOR: My dear girl, no. I’m as human as you are!\nMEL: Really?\nSUPERVISOR: Look, why are we standing around here, beside this horrible hot, dry ducting? Why don’t we go back to my office for a nice glass of water?\nMEL: I’m not sure I should trust you...\nMEL: JEAN-G: (HUSHED; SHOCKED) Mel! This is our Supervisor you’re talking to.\nSUPERVISOR: But what if I gave you that computer component?\nMEL: (SUSPICIOUS) You’ve got it?\nSUPERVISOR: I took it from the jaws of one of those awful rodent creatures. I’ve laid traps of my own, you know.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL)\nMEL: Really.\nSUPERVISOR: So what do you Say... Melanie?\nMEL: (SIGHS) We don’t really have much\nMEL: choice,\nMEL: do we?\nMEL: Page 110\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 111\nMEL: DOCTOR, ANN-F AND LYDEK PROCEED THROUGH TUNNELS.\nMEL: ANN-F: I think you were right about these tunnels being a transit system, Doctor...\nLYDEK: (AHEAD, CALLING BACK) They extend to the farthest reaches of the city. They are the quickest way to return to your.. ship.\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (SOTTO) Is bringing her back to the Warehouse a good idea, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I don’t see that we have much choice. Besides, if we can convince her of the truth... she in turn can convince her people.\nDARL: (OFF) Is there someone there? Please... please help...\nDARL: ANN-F: Doctor? Did you hear that?\nDOCTOR: Yes... it came from this side tunnel.\nLYDEK: That noise is of no concern.\nDOCTOR: It’s of concern to me. Come on, Ann-F.\nDARL: PLEASE, PLEASE. I RECANT MY BLASPHEMY. PLEASE...!\nDARL: ANN-F: Over here! (APPROACHING) She can’t move, Doctor. She’s been tied up in something.\nDOCTOR: Bubble wrap! She’s been cocooned in bubble wrap!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 112\nDARL: Please...\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. Hold still...\nDOCTOR: TEARING OF BUBBLE WRAP.\nDARL: (GASPING) I managed to bite a hole in the wrapping, but Reef... Reef...\nDOCTOR: Reef?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: There’s someone else here. All wrapped up. I think... I think he’s dead.\nLYDEK: (BEHIND) They were blasphemers. They were condemned.\nDARL: Please, High Priestess. Show mercy.\nDOCTOR: (ANGRY) Lydek. Did you condemn these people to be suffocated?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : That’s monstrous!\nLYDEK: It was your temple they defiled, Saint Ann. They were sacrificed to appease you.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: (HORRIFIED) Oh, no. No..!\nDARL: (SUDDENLY SEEING ANN CLEARLY) Saint Ann! I see now, it is! It is Saint Ann! Saint Ann... forgive me!\nDARL: ANN-F : No! No! I’m not a God!\nDOCTOR: (HARD) Listen to me, Lydek. This barbarism stops. Right now. No more talk of blasphemy. No more sacrifices. Or for once I might just decide that this civilisation isn’t worth saving. Do you understand me?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 113\nLYDEK: (PUZZLED) As you wish... (TO DARL) Darl — the Gods have spoken. You are free to go.\nDARL: Oh thank you, thank you!\nDOCTOR: TEARING MORE WRAP OFF DARL.\nDOCTOR: Here, let me help you out of this awful stuff.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: We’ll have to bring her with us. What if Lydek’s acolytes capture her again?\nDOCTOR: RUSTLING FROM ROBES.\nLYDEK: Darl, take this.\nDARL: (ASTONISHED) It’s... it’s a Gold Card!\nLYDEK: Wear this, and my Service Assistants may not harm you.\nDOCTOR: (DANGEROUS) Lydek — if I find out later that she’s been hurt...\nLYDEK: You have my word, prophet.\nDOCTOR: Go, Darl. Quickly...!\nDARL: Thank you. Oh thank you! (HURRIES OFF)\nDOCTOR: Come on, Ann-F. It’s time we put an end to all this.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR: SWISH OF A DOOR OPENING.\nSUPERVISOR: Home at last. Do come in, ladies. Make yourselves comfortable. I must just get myself a glass of water.\nSUPERVISOR: CROSSES TO THE WATERCOOLER WHICH ‘BLUPS’ AS HE POURS HIMSELF\nMEL: (SOTTO) Jean, are you certain that’s the Supervisor?\nMEL: JEAN-G: (SOTTO) Yes, of course.\nMEL: (SOTTO) So you’ve met him before?\nMEL: JEAN-G: (SOTTO) Lots of times. — Why?\nMEL: (SOTTO) I don’t know... There’s something wrong. Why would the most powerful person in the warehouse choose to live in a place like this? It’s so damp in here. And that sme1l...\nMEL: JEAN-G: (SOTTO) I told you: it’s the mould, that’s all.\nMEL: (SOTTO) But it’s stronger here than anywhere!\nSUPERVISOR: What are you two gabbing on about?\nMEL: I was just saying to Jean-G — well, that there’s something I don’t understand?\nSUPERVISOR: And what might that be, my dear?\nMEL: You say that you’re human, not a clone?\nSUPERVISOR: But of course. We couldn’t have a clone running things, that’s an absurd notion.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 115\nMEL: Ignoring that bigoted remark for a moment, that means that you’ve been alive for over three hundred and fifty years.\nSUPERVISOR: Has it really been that long?\nMEL: So how have you survived all this time?\nMEL: JEAN-G: (EMBARRASSED) Mel...\nSUPERVISOR: No, it’s alright, Jean-G. It’s a valid question. Before I took up the position of Supervisor of this facility, I had a gene inserted into my DNA strand that slowed my metabolic rate. That, and the occasional use of a cryogenic stasis capsule, has allowed me to keep doing my job... Under extremely difficult circumstances, I might add.\nMEL: But... the planet surface. Have you had any contact with the surface? Do you know what’s going on down there?\nSUPERVISOR: (STERN) Information about the surface is on a strictly need to know basis, I’m afraid. (PAUSE) Now, where did I put that component...?\nMEL: So that’s it, you’re just going to hand over that logic board and send us on our way?\nSUPERVISOR: But of course. What else would I do? You really are most mistrusting, Melanie. It’s in all our interests to get you back to that computer room with all speed. There are orders to fulfil.\nMEL: Alright. (PAUSE) I’m sorry. I guess I’m just getting jumpy, suspicious of everyone. You’re right of course.\nSUPERVISOR: Quite alright, my dear. — Do you know, I think I must have put that component down in my living quarters somewhere. Jean-G, I wonder: would you come and help me find it?\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: Yes, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 116\nFOLLOW: THEM AS THEY WALK...\nMEL: Look, why don’t I [help you —]\nDOOR: SWISHES SHUT, SEALING JEAN-G AND THE SUPERVISOR IN AN\nADJOINING: ROOM.\nSUPERVISOR: (ALL JOLLITY GONE) Well? Is Melanie able to repair the computer?\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: Yes, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: And she suspects nothing?\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: No, Supervisor. She still believes the F Family Unit were mistaken about the infection.\nSUPERVISOR: Excellent.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: But her companion has used a machine and gone down to the surface.\nSUPERVISOR: What ‘machine’? Be specific.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: A ship of some kind.\nSUPERVISOR: Then you need to watch her carefully, Jean-G. If this ‘Doctor’ has been to the surface I suspect he’1ll try to stop her repairing the machine.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: And if she learns the truth?\nSUPERVISOR: Then that would be very unfortunate for her. Very unfortunate indeed.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 117\nDOORS: OPENING. DOCTOR, ANN-F AND LYDEK ENTER.\nLYDEK: (IN AWE) This place... is magnificent! A celestial temple of light! And still you say that you are not Gods?\nLYDEK: DOCTOR AT CONSOLE, PRESSING BUTTONS. DOORS CLOSE.\nDOCTOR: If I had godlike powers, Lydek, I wouldn’t keep landing myself in these situations. Now... ‘fast return’, I think.\nTARDIS: ENGINES STARTING.\nTARDIS: ANN-F: Doctor... if the mould is the same as the fungus from the planet, then why haven’t we all been infected?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Some mutation, perhaps... The infection only appeared to have become fatal after genetic tampering. (SIGHS) Why do people always have to meddle with the natural order of things?\nDOCTOR: ‘THUMP’ OF TARDIS MATERIALISING.\nDOCTOR: We’re here. Let’s hope we’re in time!\nDOCTOR: DOORS. ALL THREE EXIT INTO...\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: (EXITING SHIP) Doctor... This isn’t where the TARDIS was before.\nDOCTOR: CLOSES TARDIS DOOR BEHIND.\nDOCTOR: No. The co-ordinates must have slipped slightly. She does that I’m afraid.\nALL: BEGIN WALKING.\nALL: ANN-F : It looks like we’re in one of the main exhaust vents.\nLYDEK: (LOOKING AROUND) It is... not as I expected...\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t suppose it is. Come on, we’ve got to get to that computer room.\nSUDDENLY: SCURRYING, SCRABBLING OFF.\nLYDEK: What was that sound?\nLYDEK: ANN-F : Oh no. Vermin!\nLYDEK: Vermin?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid Paradise might not be all that you hoped for, [Lydek... ]\nSUDDENLY: DEAFENING SHRIEK-SQUEALING. HUNDREDS OF ‘RATS’\nPOURING: IN, ALL AROUND THEM!\nLYDEK: Gods preserve me!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: They’re all around us!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR: Both of you, against the wall!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : There must be hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: Yes.

HUNDREDS OF ‘RATS’\nPOURING: IN, ALL AROUND THEM!\nLYDEK: Gods preserve me!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no...\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: They’re all around us!\nDOCTOR: Both of you, against the wall!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: There must be hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: Yes. I rather think I’ve managed to land us right in the middle of their nest...!\nLYDEK: (GASPS — PSYCHIC PAIN) My head..!\nDOCTOR: Lydek? What is it? What’s wrong?\nLYDEK: Their voices! Their voices are in my head...!\nLYDEK: ANN-F: The vermin? They’re talking to her?\nDOCTOR: So it would seem. (TO LYDEK) Well, what are they saying?\nLYDEK: “Wait.”\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 121\nLYDEK: ANN-F: Doctor, look! The vermin - they’re knotting their tails together.\nDOCTOR: I know what this is, I’ve seen it before! They’re forming a Rat King!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : A what?\nDOCTOR: A Rat King. A gestalt creature.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F : So the ‘vermin’\nDOCTOR: . are an intelligent alien species. Multiple minds working as one. And somehow Lydek is receptive to thenm...!\nLYDEK: (TO RATS) Yes, yes — I hear you.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: Why her?\nDOCTOR: Because her neural pathways have been widened by prolonged exposure to that powder, I suspect.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: But if these creatures are so intelligent — why have they been causing so much damage?\nDOCTOR: Let’s ask them, shall we? — Good afternoon. I’m the Doctor.\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED - MULTITRACK WITH WHISPERED VERSIONS]: You are not a clone worker.\nDOCTOR: No. I’m just a traveller, who arrived at the Warehouse by accident. As did you, I suspect...?\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: Not by accident. Our instruments detected a dangerous infectious organism. We came to investigate. To help.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: (ASTONISHED) You’re.. space travellers?\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 122\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: We are the Muroid (‘lure-oid’), from the planets of the Eurminidae (yure-mini-die) galaxy.\nDOCTOR: Then you’re a very long way from home.\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: We are the first of the long-range survey teams. We hoped to establish peaceful contact.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: So where’s your ship?\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]:\nLYDEK: Adrift. Some of our crew became infected when we first landed. In the struggle to stop them using the ship to reach the planet below, its navigational controls were damaged. Our ship was pulled into the planet’s orbit.\nDOCTOR: Trapping you here.\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: Yes. And so we have tried to contain the spread of the fungal infection. To ensure it could not re-infect the planet below.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: So that’s why you disabled the computer!\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: Your drones would have proved an ideal means to spread the disease.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: And all this time we’ve been trying to kill you, treating you like vermin.\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: We have suffered... losses at your hands, yes.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: I’m so sorry.\nDOCTOR: Time for reconciliations later. Right now we have prevent Mel from repairing that computer.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 123\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]:\nLYDEK: You may already be too late. Our attempts to stop her acquiring the logic board required to complete the repairs have been thwarted by the actions of the creature that was once the Supervisor.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean — ‘the creature that was once the Supervisor’?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 124\nCOMPUTERY: FX. SWISH OF DOOR.\nCOMPUTERY: ANN-G: Mum! Mel! Thank goodness.\nMEL: (ENTERING) Good to see you too, Ann-G.\nMEL: FRED-G: We thought the Fs must have caught you. Them, or the vermin.\nSUPERVISOR: (ENTERING) And they might have done, dear boy, but for my intervention.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: Supervisor! In person!\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: He found us chasing vermin in the service ducts.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-G: But did you get the part you needed?\nMEL: Eventually. It turned out he had it.\nSUPERVISOR: Never mind that now. Hadn’t you better be getting on with those repairs? We do have a stocktake to be getting on with, you know.\nMEL: I suppose so.\nSUPERVISOR: Fred, my boy, a word in your ear, if I may...\nFOLLOW: THEM INTO CORRIDOR; DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES.\nFOLLOW: FRED-G: What can I do you for, Supervisor?\nSUPERVISOR: (ALL LEVITY GONE AGAIN) Are all the packages ready for delivery?\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: Yes, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 125\nSUPERVISOR: Good. Because if the woman Melanie really can do as she says, then the computer will be fixed within the hour. Have you seen anything of this ‘Doctor’?\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: No, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: It seems that he and the child from Bay F went to the surface. If they’ve learned the truth... it would be highly inconvenient!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: What do you want me to do?\nSUPERVISOR: Keep an eye on that girl. Tell me the moment that the computer\nSUPERVISOR: is repaired.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: Yes, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: Meanwhile, I’d better contact your clone brothers...\nSUPERVISOR: FADE.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 126\nSUPERVISOR: (TANNOY) This is the Supervisor calling all section managers.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F : Fred! Fred-F! It’s him...!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: (COMING OVER) What’s he want now...?\nSUPERVISOR: (TANNOY) Drone delivery service is expected to commence shortly. In the meantime, all clones are to check their bays for an alien known as the Doctor. He may try and attempt to interfere with the operation of this Warehouse. He is to be apprehended on sight. If he resists... kill him. Supervisor out.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: Well, there’s a turn-up. And all along I was thinking that the Doctor was in league with him.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F: (WORRIED) What about Ann? If she’s with that Doctor...\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: We'll just have to go out there and find him first.\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F : But the infection...\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: I’m beginning to think that the infection might be the least of our worries.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 127\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: (INCREDULOUS) The Supervisor is infected by the mould?\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: The mould has a way of controlling the brain. Many of the clones are already under its influence.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: So Dad was right all along.\nDOCTOR: The question is, why? What have those infected clones been up to all this time...?\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: The Supervisor is working to a plan, that much is certain.\nDOCTOR: Whatever his plan, it requires a fully-functioning computer. We must get to Bay G and stop Mel from completing those repairs!\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]: That could take time. For our own safety we built this nest a long way from the computer room.\nDOCTOR: We have to try.\nLYDEK: [POSSESSED]:\nLYDEK: The most direct route is through the computer’s cooling vents. We are small enough to get through... but without a means to communicate our intent...\nLYDEK: ANN-F: I should be small enough to follow you through the vents.\nDOCTOR: Excellent! Then you go with the Muroids to the computer room.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: What about you?\nDOCTOR: The Supervisor will need the Warehouse’s flying drones to reach the planet. I presume they’re stored in some central location?\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Yes. There’s a hanger at the very bottom of the Warehouse.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: Then I think I’1ll pay it a visit.\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Why? What are you up to?\nDOCTOR: Contingency planning. Muroids — you’d better release Lydek.\nLYDEK: (GASPS AS PSYCHIC GRIP RELEASED) Ohh...!\nDOCTOR: The rest of you — go. Hurry!\nDOCTOR: ANN-F: Good luck, Doctor!\nSQUEALING: RATS HURRY OFF WITH ANN-F.\nDOCTOR: Lydek? Are you alright?\nLYDEK: Those creatures were in my mind...\nDOCTOR: Years of exposure to that powder has made you highly receptive to them. (BEAT) That powder... how’s it made?\nLYDEK: From a dried fungus...\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course — the original fungus, minus the genetic tampering that made it deadly. It’s that ability to forge a synaptic connection that allows the mould to control the mind...\nLYDEK: Your words are strange, prophet. I do not understand.\nDOCTOR: Never mind, Lydek. And stop calling me the ‘prophet’ - I’m the Doctor. Come on. We’ve got work to do.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 129\nCOMPUTERY: FX.\nSUPERVISOR: (SNAPPING) What is taking you so long, Melanie?\nMEL: Give me a chance! This component is tricky to install, I’m going as fast as I can.\nSUPERVISOR: I’m. So sorry, my dear. Please forgive my impatience. It’s just — it’s so hot in here, and I’ve been under such strain. Let me just get some water.\nSUPERVISOR: BUBBLING OF WATERCOOLER.\nMEL: That’s alright. Just a few more connections and we should be able to get everything working properly.\nSUPERVISOR: (TO HIMSELF) A few more moments... yes. After centuries of waiting. (GURGLES WATER)\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 130\nSUPERVISOR: DOCTOR AND LYDEK, WALKING QUICKLY.\nLYDEK: It is exactly as written.. Treasures as far as the eye can see.\nDOCTOR: And is it everything that you dreamed that it would be, Lydek? Was it worth all the sacrifices? The countless lives lost needlessly?\nLYDEK: The smoke in the oracle room revealed to me what lies beneath the veil of your mind, Proph- (CORRECTING HERSELF) Forgive me: Doctor. Your hands are far from bloodless.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) No.\nLYDEK: It may be that I have led the people down the wrong path. If it is.. I shall seek to make amends.\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 131\nLYDEK: ANN-F CRAWLING, TO STOP. MUROIDS SCAMPERING WITH HER.\nLYDEK: ANN-F: (SOTTO) There’s the computer room, behind the vent.\nMUROIDS: [SQUEALING, IMPLIES “What can you see?” ]\nMUROIDS: ANN-F: (SOTTO) I can see Mel. But the Supervisor’s in there. Oh, and the Gs. — We need to get them out of there. Can you lot create\nMUROIDS: some kind of diversion?\nMUROIDS: [SQUEALING, IMPLIES “OK.” ]\nMUROIDS: SCRABBLING OF CLAWS ON METAL AS MUROIDS SCURRY OFF.\nMUROIDS: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: (WALKS TO DOOR, WITH LYDEK) Here we are...\nDOCTOR: KEYPAD. HYDRAULIC DOOR OPENING.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Door to drone hanger, opening.\nDOCTOR: & LYDEK WALK INTO CAVERNOUS SPACE. DOOR CLOSES BEHIND.\nLYDEK: What is this place?\nDOCTOR: A hangar holding thousands of drones, all ready to deliver the goods stored in the Warehouse to the surface.\nLYDEK: The angels...!\nDOCTOR: Angels of death. These machines - and that’s what they are, Lydek: machines - will spell the end of your people if we’re not careful. (STOPS TO EXAMINE DRONE) Now then, let’s take a look at your circuits.\nCLICK: AS HE OPENS DRONE PANEL.\nLYDEK: Well? What have you found?\nDOCTOR: Yes, as I thought. The drones are all interlinked by some complex flocking programme.\nLYDEK: Once again, I do not understand. Please explain.\nDOCTOR: The drones receive their orders from the central computer, but once they leave the Warehouse they have a certain amount of autonomous control. They’d need it, to avoid unforeseen obstacles, or just to avoid crashing into one another.\nLYDEK: Like a swarm of bees, or a flock of birds. Many creatures, moving as if with a single mind.\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) Yes... Yes, exactly.\nLYDEK: And so if you can bring one of these metal creatures under your\nLYDEK: control...\nDOCTOR: You catch on quickly, Lydek.\nHANGER: DOOR OPENS, OFF.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Door to drone hanger opening.\nDOCTOR: What...?\nFRED: & JEAN-F RUSH IN.\nLYDEK: Saint Fred! Saint Jean!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. The Fs!\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: (APPROACHING) Doctor! We’ve found you!\nDOCTOR: JEAN-F: (APPROACHING) But what have you done with our Ann?\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 134\nSUDDEN: ALARM.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Alert. Vermin infestation detected in central zone.\nSUPERVISOR: What is it? Jean-G, what’s going on?\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: Sounds like those pests have broken through the internal panelling again.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: Filthy beasts!\nSUPERVISOR: Where? Where are they now, exactly?\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-G: Computer? Can you tell?\nMEL: Will you lot please be quiet?! I’m trying to concentrate!\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Vermin infestation narrowed to Supervisor’s Office.\nSUPERVISOR: (SPLUTTERING) My office! We must get them out! At once!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: I’ll get the tasers. Ann-G, you stay here and help Mel.\nSUPERVISOR: Come on, come on! They could be doing untold damage!\nSUPERVISOR: FRED, JEAN AND SUPERVISOR HURRY OFF. AS SOON AS DOOR SWISHES\nSHUT: ANN-F: (SOTTO) Psst. Mel!\nMEL: Did you say something, Ann-G?\nMEL: ANN-G: I didn’t say a word.\nMEL: ANN-F: (SOTTO) Mel, it’s me! Down here!\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 135\nMEL: ANN-G: Hold on, that came from the v— (SURPRISE) Ann-F? What on earth are you doing down there?\nMEL: ANN-F: Help me open this grille, Ann-G, and I’11 tell you.\nGRILLE: LIFTED. ANN-F SCRAMBLES OUT.\nGRILLE: ANN-G: What’s going on, Ann-F?\nMEL: And where’s the Doctor?\nMEL: ANN-F: (URGENT) Mel, listen, you mustn’t complete those repairs. If you do it will spell disaster for everyone on the planet below.\nMEL: ANN-G: (SCOFFS) Is there something wrong with you, Ann-F?\nMEL: ANN-F:\nMEL: Don’t you see, Ann-G? We were wrong about the vermin. They’re not our enemy. It’s the Supervisor, he’s infected with that mould!\nMEL: I knew there was something fishy about him!\nMEL: ANN-F: Dad... Fred-F, he was right. The mould takes people over, and now it wants to re-infect the planet below.\nMEL: Alright, so where’s the Doctor?\nMEL: ANN-F: Gone down to the drone hanger to try and sabotage things there. He told me to stop you fixing the computer...\nDOOR: SWISHES OPEN IN THE BACKGROUND. NO ONE HEARS IT.\nMEL: But it’s practically finished! It’s just a matter of making the\nMEL: last connection...\nSUPERVISOR: (ENTERING) .. and it won’t take a computer genius to do that.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 136\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: What’s going on, Doctor? I thought that you and the Supervisor were working together, but he’s just given orders to kill you.\nDOCTOR: Never mind, Fred-F. I suppose it was inevitable once he realised that I’d been to the surface, along with your Ann.\nDOCTOR: JEAN-F : You took Ann to the surface? Is she safe?\nDOCTOR: Ann-F has gone to try and stop Mel repairing the computer. You were right all along, Fred-F. The Es, the Gs... they’re all controlled by the Supervisor. He’s had them working to his plan all this time.\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: I knew it! But what is his plan?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure, but it relies on these drones making their deliveries. Tell me — is there any way of disconnecting them from the main computer?\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: No, there are too many fail-safes.\nDOCTOR: Then I’1l have to hope that planting an instruction in just one of them will do the trick.\nRUMMAGES: INSIDE DRONE INTERIOR.\nLYDEK: Doctor, what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Call it.. ‘consumer protection’.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 137\nSUPERVISOR: So, Ann-F — back from your little jaunt to the surface, I see.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-G: And in league with the vermin.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: No, I —\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: Did you really think that the Supervisor would fall for your ‘distraction’? — Come away from her, Ann-G.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-G: (COMPLYING) Mum.\nSUPERVISOR: Now — (HARD) Where’s the Doctor?\nMEL: She doesn’t know.\nSUPERVISOR: I wasn’t asking you. Don’t make me hurt you, Ann-F...\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: T=\nMEL: (BLOCKING HIM) Don’t even think about it, Supervisor. Lay a finger on Ann-F and I’1l wreck the computer.\nMEL: FRED-G: Let me deal with them, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: No need, Fred-G, no need. A bit of gentle persuasion is all that’s required. Jean-G — please, place your hands around the throat... of Ann-G.\nMEL: What?!\nMEL: JEAN-G: Please, Supervisor...\nMEL: FRED-G: Do as the Supervisor says, Jean-G.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 138\nMEL: ANN-G: Mum...?\nMEL: JEAN-G: I’m.. sorry, love.\nMEL: ANN-G:\nSUPERVISOR: You see, Mel. My influence is more than enough to overcome any programmed feelings of family loyalty.\nMEL: You monster!\nMEL: ANN-F: Jean-G — let Ann go! Don’t listen to him. It’s a fungus making you do this! A mould!\nSUPERVISOR: (SHARP) Carry on, Jean-G!\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-G: Yes... Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: Ah... The clone mind is such a simple thing to control... All except the Anns. For some reason the Anns have unusual resistance.\nMEL: Alright, alright! Let Ann-G go, and I’1l complete the connection!\nSUPERVISOR: Good girl.\nMEL: PLUGS IN THE FINAL COMPONENT. HUM OF POWER.\nMEL: It’s done...\nSUPERVISOR: Let her go, Jean-G.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-G: (LET GO.

Lydek — are you happy to act as our translator again?\nLYDEK: (WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOUR) Interceding is what High Priestesses are best at.\nDOCTOR: Humour, Lydek? I didn’t know you had it in you.\nDOCTOR: ‘THWIPPING’ OF RATS TWISTING TAILS TOGETHER.\nLYDEK: (GASPS, THEN:) [POSSESSED] Doctor.

But no idle threat, I suspect. I think it’d be best if you accompanied me back to my office. We shall monitor the final delivery from there.\nMEL: I’m not going anywhere with you.\nMEL: JEAN-G: You have no choice.\nSUPERVISOR: Fred, Jean — stay here, tie up those Anns: both of them. If Melanie here causes me any problems... you know what to do.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-G: We’re not scared of you, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: Well said, Ann-G. Dad and the Doctor will find a way of stopping you, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: Such faith. So misplaced.\nMEL: Underestimating the Doctor is a common mistake.\nSUPERVISOR: Shall we go?

You did what we thought was the right thing.\nSUPERVISOR: (TANNOY) How touching. I think that it’s time we met face-to- face, Doctor. Come to my office - alone.

My clones have been working hard, ensuring that mould spores are in every package due for delivery.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that was the real purpose of the stocktake.\nSUPERVISOR: A way to ensure we infected as many of the goods as possible.\nMEL: But why?

Skin, flesh, organs... I’m not sure there’s actually anything left of the original organism at all.\nTRANSFORMATION: FX END.\nSUPERVISOR: Ah, that is so much better. The bipedal form is such an ungainly shape to maintain...\nDOCTOR: Fascinating. Not just infected. Totally absorbed.\nSUPERVISOR: My spores first arrived on one of the construction shuttles. For years they were left in the cargo bays, exposed to cosmic rays and solar radiation, mutating, adapting, growing...\nDOCTOR: Evolving.\nSUPERVISOR: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: But only thanks to the genetic tampering you’d undergone, back on the planet below.\nSUPERVISOR: Ah, yes. We were alone in the forest for so long, the simplest of organisms...\nDOCTOR: Until the scientists came. So eager to manufacture a wondrous drug that they totally overlooked the most remarkable thing about you.\nMEL: Which was?\nDOCTOR: Sentience. A mould that can think.\nSUPERVISOR: The genetic changes they made to our DNA allowed us to invade a host, to control the brain. The aim was to create a harmless symbiotic relationship.\nDOCTOR: But you killed your hosts!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 147\nSUPERVISOR: Yes, well, in any new experiment there are bound to be teething problems.\nMEL: Teething problems!\nDOCTOR: You wiped out an entire civilisation!\nSUPERVISOR: Well, they tried to wipe us out! If the tiniest part of me hadn’t escaped up here, our species would have withered and died.\nMEL: So now you want to infect the planet again?\nSUPERVISOR: Yes, but this time, our mutated form will allow us to control our hosts, to absorb them. With a big enough workforce, we can start a programme of interstellar travel...\nDOCTOR: And spread your infection throughout the stars. I can’t allow that.\nSUPERVISOR: You sound like the Muroids, they too thought they could control us.\nMEL: Muroids?\nDOCTOR: Our rodent friends. They realised the nature of the mould.\nSUPERVISOR: Filthy vermin.

Rerouting drones.\nSUPERVISOR: You can’t do that, you stupid machine!\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) All customers are to be given a full refund. Thank you for your patience!\nSUPERVISOR: How have you done this? (BELLOWING) How have you done this!\nMEL: Yes, I was wondering the same!\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR: A simple matter of placing a delayed order into the drone flocking program. As we speak the first batch of drones are breaking off from their projected orbit path, and heading for the nearest sun...\nSUPERVISOR: My spores...!!!\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Drones redirecting to close solar orbit. Faulty products to be destroyed.\nSUPERVISOR: No!\nMEL: Oh dear, Supervisor. Looks like you won’t be hitting your delivery targets.\nSUPERVISOR: Curse you, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: It’s over, Supervisor.\nSUPERVISOR: If we cannot have the planet, then we shall absorb every living thing in this Warehouse.\nMEL: What?\nSUPERVISOR: (STRAINING TO TRANSFORM) Soon the inside of this space station will be nothing... but a mass of mould!!!\nPLANT: OUTGROWING ITS POT.\nMEL: Doctor! He’s growing!\nDOCTOR: Quick, Mel. Out!\nSWELLING: CONTINUES AS THEY RUSH OUT. DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES.\nCROSS TO: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 152\nCROSS TO: BEEPING OF KEYPAD. MUFFLED GROWING NOISE FROM WITHIN.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Door to Supervisor’s office, sealed.\nMEL: That’s not going to hold him for long!\nDOCTOR: No, but every little helps.\nMEL: He looked just like your experiment, back in the cage in Bay F. If he carries on growing like that...\nDOCTOR: Yes, before long this whole Warehouse will become a very unhealthy environment.\nMEL: What are we going to do? We can’t fumigate the entire Warehouse!\nDOCTOR: (ALMOST TO HIMSELF) Dried fungus...\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR: The computer room! Quickly!\nDOCTOR: THEY RACE OFF.\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 153\nSWELLING: FX. CRASHES AS BITS OF FURNITURE ARE CRUSHED OR\nDISLODGED: BY HIS EXPANDING BULK.\nSUPERVISOR: You’11 not... stop me, Doctor!!!\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 154\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: So what do we do now, Jean-F?\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F: Ann-G’s taken a Muroid escort to lock up her Mum and Dad. Nothing much we can do, except wait for the Doctor.\nLYDEK: Good. Then he can take me away from this... unholy place.\nLYDEK: VAST, DISTANT ENGINES.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Activating station thrusters.\nCOMPUTER: ANN-F : What was that? Dad?\nCOMPUTER: FRED-F: The whole Warehouse is moving!\nCOMPUTER: DOOR. DOCTOR AND MEL RACE IN.\nCOMPUTER: ANN-F : Doctor! Mel!\nCOMPUTER: JEAN-F: What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: The Supervisor’s getting desperate.\nDOCTOR: FRED-F: What, so he’s trying to fly the Warehouse away?\nDOCTOR: Oh no. I suspect he’s planning to crash the whole station onto the planet below.\nMEL: That’s one way of spreading his spores!\nDOCTOR: Quickly, Mel. The computer’s environmental control circuits — which are they?\nMEL: Coded green, if I remember rightly.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 155\nDOCTOR: The mould needs moisture to survive.\nMEL: That’s why his office was so damp - and why he kept drinking the whole time!\nMEL: FRED-F: He had watercoolers everywhere!\nMEL: JEAN-F: Now we know why!\nDOCTOR: If I can set the heating and dehumidifiers to maximum, he should start to desiccate — to dry to a powder.\nLYDEK: Like the powder our people used...!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. We can then vent him out into space.\nMEL: But how are we going to get the Supervisor out of his office?\nLYDEK: Show me where it is. I shall lure him away.\nDOCTOR: Lydek?\nLYDEK: This palace of metal means nothing to me now. But if this Supervisor would use it to destroy my people... it is my sacred duty to stop him.\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 156\nDISTANT: ENGINES.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Warning. Warehouse entering planetary atmosphere. This facility is now operating beyond engineering tolerances.\nSUPERVISOR: Did you hear that, Doctor? It’s end for you, and the beginning for m—\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Environment controls adjusting. Humidity down to 70%... 65%... 60%... 55%...\nSUPERVISOR: (OVER THIS, AGHAST) Wait. Wait! I’m... I’m shrinking...!\nSUPERVISOR: CRACKING, RECESSIONAL FX.\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 157\nROARING: ENGINES.\nROARING: FRED-F: Doctor, if we get too much further into the atmosphere, we’1l never be able to pull up again!\nROARING: JEAN-F: We must override the navigation controls.\nDOCTOR: No! The friction on the hull is giving us extra heat - drying the air quicker.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Hull temperature now reaching critical.\nMEL: Yes, but will we survive long enough to dry the Supervisor out?\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 158\nMEL: 88. SUPERVISOR’S OFFICE\nROARING: ENGINES.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Humidity down to 40% and falling.\nSUPERVISOR: (AGHAST) So hot... so dry... what’s happening to me?!\nDOOR: SWISHES OPEN.\nLYDEK: Are you the ‘Supervisor’?\nSUPERVISOR: What? Who are you?\nLYDEK: You do not know? Does a God not recognise his devoted servant? A loyal cardholder?\nSUPERVISOR: God? — Of course, the Doctor brought you back from the planet...!\nLYDEK: That blasphemous Doctor. Destroyer of drone angels. Now he would kill you, too, with ‘environmental controls’.\nSUPERVISOR: Of course..! Loyal servant — if I am your God, save me! Kill the Doctor!\nLYDEK: He is too well-guarded, by vermin and traitor Saints. But he transported me here in his space machine, his TARDIS. I saw how he operated it.\nSUPERVISOR: But... do you know where it is?\nLYDEK: Come. I will show you.\nLYDEK: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 159\nROARING: ENGINES.\nROARING: FRED-F: The Warehouse can’t take much more of this, Doctor..!\nDOCTOR: Hold your nerve, Fred-F. If I can time the opening of the exhaust vents properly, then the mould will burn up in the atmosphere.\nMEL: Can’t we just release it into space?\nDOCTOR: Do that, and there’s a chance it’1ll mutate again. We must give Lydek more time...!\nDOCTOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 160\nENGINES: EVEN LOUDER. BITS ARE CRUMBLING OFF THE SUPERVISOR THROUGHOUT THE SCENE.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Humidity down to ten per cent...\nSUPERVISOR: (WEAK, HUFFING) So hot..I’m just flaking away!\nLYDEK: Fear not, Lord Supervisor. The Doctor’s machine is this way...!\nSUPERVISOR: What, in the exhaust vents? (SUSPICIOUS) You wouldn’t lie to me, would you? Lie to your god?\nLYDEK: Lie? I shall tell you of a lie - a monumental, iniquitous, wicked lie. Year after year, decade after decade, century after century a High Priestess of Customer Service has waited patiently by the terminal on the world below, waiting to hear from the Gods above.\nSUPERVISOR: And here I am. — Now show me the Doctor’s machine!\nLYDEK: To think that I worshipped a creature like you. That I killed in the name of a mould, a fungus, a disease!\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) Lydek. You have to get out of there. I can’t hold off opening the vents any longer, or it’1ll be too late to save the Warehouse!\nLYDEK: I hear you, Doctor!\nSUPERVISOR: It is a trick! (MAKES FOR THE DOOR)\nLYDEK: (SLAMS THE DOOR) You’re going nowhere. All my life, I have wanted to meet my maker - now we can do so together!\nCOMPUTER: Exhaust vents opening in ten seconds. — Nine. [CONTINUING\nUNDER: ] Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.\nUNDER: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 161\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) Lydek, get out!\nLYDEK: No. I must atone for the things I have done.\nDOCTOR: (TANNOY) What? — No! Lydek, you’ve done enough!\nSUPERVISOR: Please, Doctor. Have pity..!\nLYDEK: Goodbye, Doctor.\nCOMPUTER: (TANNOY) Vents opening.\nMASSIVE: SHUTTERS MOVING. HUGE WOOSH OF AIR AS THE MOULD\nVENTED: OUT INTO SPACE.\nSUPERVISOR: Nooooo!!!\nSUPERVISOR: BURNING. FADE.\nSUPERVISOR: IS\nSUPERVISOR: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 162\nSUPERVISOR: DOCTOR, MEL AND THE THREE Fs WALKING UP TO TARDIS.\nSUPERVISOR: FRED-F: That’s the Doctor’s spaceship? That blue shed?\nSUPERVISOR: ANN-F: I told you, Dad!\nSUPERVISOR: JEAN-F : Doesn’t look like much to me.\nALL: STOPPING.\nMEL: It does us very well, Jean-F.\nDOCTOR: Right, then — Fred-F, Jean-F, Ann; Muroids...\nMUROID: SQUEAKS.\nMUROID: ANN-F: You’re going, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Well, the Warehouse is safely back in its geostationary orbit. I’ve located the Muroids’ ship, activated its engines remotely and set up a homing beacon - it should rendezvous with you on\nDOCTOR: the next pass of the planet.\nMUROID: SQUEALS.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. I’m afraid without poor Lydek, I’m having trouble\nDOCTOR: understanding you.\nMEL: It’s pretty obvious, Doctor. They’re saying, ‘Thank you.’\nDOCTOR: Ah, well. My pleasure. Or should I say: (HE ATTEMPTS TO SQUEAK IN MUROID)\nMUROIDS: SQUEAK IN ALARM & SCATTER AWAY.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Evidently I shouldn’t have said.\nMEL: Maybe stick to English, in future.\nMEL: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 163\nMEL: ANN-F: Now the mould’s gone, will the other family units get back to normal?\nMEL: I should imagine they’re stocktaking already.\nDOCTOR: You Fs will have to convince them that it’s time to stop counting supplies, and start delivering all this bounty to the planet below. There are still plenty of drones.\nMEL: And if they should fail — there’s always Bay Q.\nMEL: JEAN-F : Fabrics and materials?\nMEL: FRED-F: I get it. Parachutes!\nMEL: Easy.\nDOCTOR: (OPENING TARDIS DOOR) Come along, Mel. We have an appointment on Megrootii (meg-rooty-eye) Prime.\nMEL: (ENTERING) Oh, at last...!\nMEL: ANN-F: Doctor — are you sure there’s nothing we can give you? From the shelves?\nDOCTOR: I ask for no reward, Ann-F. Besides, I’ve already found out to my cost that your biscuits are a little past their ‘use by’ date. Goodbye.\nTARDIS: DOOR SHUTS.\nTARDIS: ANN-F: Goodbye...\nTARDIS: FRED-F: Come on, Ann. We need to get those remaining drones online.\nTARDIS: JEAN-F: Turns out we’ve got a lot of customers. And they’ve been waiting an awful long [time. ]\nTARDIS: THE WAREHOUSE by Mike Tucker (FINAL) Page 164\nTARDIS: DOOR SUDDENLY REOPENS.\nDOCTOR: On second thoughts... it can get a little wet on Megrootii. I don’t suppose I could trouble you for a new umbrel1la...?\nDOCTOR: THE END"
