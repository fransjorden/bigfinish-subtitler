You should wrap up warmer, you know!\nJOHN: Tam fine. (Laughs) Really, 1 am. I was a little out of sorts but I’m all the better for seeing you two. How are you both?\nVICTOR: Muddling along, John. Muddling along.\nJOHN: Where are my manners? Let me pour you both a drink. Wine?\nJACQUELINE: Coh, yes! Some of that delicious red you make yourself.\nJOHN: Now let me just-—\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts) Just a small glass for Jacqueline. You know how... flighty she gets.\nJOHN: Come on now, Victor. Tonight is a celebration.\nVICTOR: (Interrupts) I think I know my wife best, thank you, dobn.\nVICTOR: JOHN Of course, my apologies.\nVICTOR: He pours three glasses of wine.\nJOHN: There you go.

They all laugh.\nJOHN: 195\nJOHN: VICTOR And leaving you a wonderful maid.\nJOHN: Jade?\nVICTOR: She’s certainly a pretty young thing, John.\nJOHN: (Has obviously never considered JADE in this way) Yes, I suppose she probably is. I believe she has a young man in town.\nVICTOR: Young men never have money or intelligence, though\nVICTOR: John. Perhaps you—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) Victor!\nVICTOR: Ah... but she doesn't compare to my sweet and charitable Jacqueline. ;\nJOHN: (Quietly) No... (Louder) So you like what I've done with\nJOHN: the study? I've tried to make it a little more homely. I’m afraid old Woolstencroft had an unhealthy obsession with darkness.\nJACQUELINE: Ob, but it’s a wonderful house! So old. Well, apart from the curse!®\nJOHN: Ah, yes, the curse!\nVICTOR: Curse?\nVICTOR: JOHN The curse! Your beloved wife told me all about it! Bit of a family-\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts with a hint of jealously) When?\nJOHN: Oh... ah, just after I inherited the place.\nJACQUELINE: You tell him, John.\nJOHN: Well, you know how Jacqueline’s ancestors, the Uttersons, founded Perfugium many years ago?\nVICTOR: How could I forget? Her mother reminds me every time\nVICTOR: we meet. (Shrill voice) ‘You've married into the Founding Family, Victor. Moved up the social scale now.\nVICTOR: They laugh.\nJOHN: Well, the Uttersons were said to be a devout, disciplined family. Well... most of them. One of them, Sir Joseph Utterson was, I believe, the black sheep of the family. A gambling drunk, he was said to cavort with whores and beggars. His family shunned him, so he built himself this house and continued his life of debauchery within these walls.\nVICTOR: Debauchery, eh? Doesn’t sound that bad!\nJOHN: Ah, but then one night he went too far. He procured himself a young girl, plied her with brandy and absinthe, believing her to be one of his ladies of the night. Only she wasn’t. And... during their ‘night of wickedness’ she died. Her father, seeking revenge, slaughtered Sir Joseph and all his servants~\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts) And placed a curse on the house that whoever lived here would meet a similar fate?\nJACQUELINE: (Claps her hands) You have heard it!\nVICTOR: It's hardly the most original legend, my darling. Superstitious claptrap!\nJACQUELINE: Oh, Victor! You’re no fun! Just think! The ghost of Sir Joseph could be in this very room.\nJOHN: (Behind JACQUELINE’s shoulder) Boo!\nJACQUELINE: John!’\nVICTOR: laughs. Very briefly and almost unnoticeably a whispering voice Jaughs along with VICTOR.\nVICTOR: 196\nVICTOR: (Laughing) I'm afraid my wife has the same ridiculous sensibilities as ever, John. Oh, I nearly forgot. Your present...\nJOHN: Oh, thank you both. Really, I wasn’t expecting...\nVICTOR: I wouldn’t get too excited, old man. I’m afraid I've been rather busy with work and so Jacqueline had to choose it. Bound to be some ridiculous, romantic rubbish.\"\nJOHN: I’m sure it will be excellent. Shall I open it now, or after dinner?\nJACQUELINE: Oh, after dinner! My stomach feels as if my throat has been cut.\nJACQUELINE: The whispering voice, again almost unnoticeable, sniggers as JOHN speaks,\nJOHN: After dinner it is then. If you'll both excuse me, I shall see how Jade is getting on.\nJOHN: VICTOR Of course.\nJOHN: leaves, closing the door.\nVICTOR: (Lowered voice) There you go again. Making a fool of yourself, Jacqueline. Fawning over him. He’s not one of your charitable cases.\nJACQUELINE: (Lowered voice) And I see, my dear husband, that you are doing your best to ruin what could be a perfectly wonderful evening. What is the matter with you tonight?\"\nVICTOR: Oh, Jacqueline, you do know me too well.\nJACQUELINE: Indeed I do. So? What’s wrong?\nVICTOR: There’s been... there’s been another murder.\nJACQUELINE: (Shocked) Oh... (quieter) oh, I'm so sorry. Was it the same as the others?\nVICTOR: Yes. Another poor young girl. This one wasn’t even a- I had... I had to tell her mother.'”\nJACQUELINE: 0h, Victor. 1 am sorry. And was she—\nVICTOR: Cnterrupts) Like the others? Yes. All these years as an Adjudicator and I still cannot understand how anybody could do such a thing\nVICTOR: JACQUELINE And you're no nearer to finding the killer?\nVICTOR: No. (Sips his drink contemplatively) He’s playing with us.\nJOHN: returns.\nJOHN: Playing? I hope you two aren't planning more games for\nJOHN: later. If I remember correctly, last time, Victor, you Managed to fleece me out of a great deal of money!\nVICTOR: (Quietly) No... no.\nJOHN: Is something amiss?\nJOHN: sac oEae (Trying to brighten the mood) We're fine, John. Is dinner ready?\nJOHN: Indeed it is!\nJACQUELINE: Good! I’m famished. I swear I could eat a horse.\nJOHN: (Deadpan) It is funny that you should say that...\nJOHN: They laugh.\nJACQUELINE: Well, a lady should never arrive at the table unescorted. If you will each take one of my arms... (To VICTOR) there... (To JOHN) thank you.\nJACQUELINE: They leave the study and walk down the hall.\nJACQUELINE: 197\nJOHN: So, I believe you two were at the theatre the other evening.\nSACQUELINE: (Laughs) Oh, wait until I tell you about it, John. Victor what did we think of (dramatically) Portentum! (She laughs)\nSACQUELINE: SCENE 4: SILENCE. Silence, then very quickly...\nVOICE: (Whispers) I know you can hear me. (Sniggers) This should be very sudden and quiet, almost subliminal.\nVOICE: SCENE 5: INT. THE DINING ROOM. We hear JOHN, JACQUELINE and VICTOR approach the dining room — another clock is ticking.\nJACQUELINE: (Muffled, still laughing) And they kept... oh, they kept preaking into song. (Sings in an operatic/OTT style) ‘And hence one master-passion in the breast, Like Aaron’s serpent, swallows up the rest.\nVICTOR: (Muffled laughter) As you hear, John, I did not choose my wife for her musical abilities.\nVICTOR: The door opens and they enter.\nJACQUELINE: Oh, but it was so ridiculous. This boy was just killing people for no apparent reason. But when one of his victims rose up from the dance hall floor and began to sing... well, I wasn’t the only one laughing, was I dear?”\nVICTOR: No. I was disappointed myself. Would have liked some kind of reason as to his motives.\nJOHN: Is there always a motive?\nVICTOR: Isn’t that what you always tell me? Whenever I suggest otherwise you start quoting one of those damn books of yours!\nJOHN: Yes. I do not know. Recently, I have begun to wonder if\nJOHN: sometimes those who kill simply have a different morality to the rest of- He is interrupted by the cat squealing as he stands on it.\nJOHN: (Gasps) Wretched creature! Come on, get out! Out, out!\nJACQUELINE: Oh, did the poor kitty get in the nasty man’s way? (She continues making ‘mewing’ noises to the cat and talking to it as JOHN and VICTOR speak)\nJOHN: Poor kitty nothing. I swear the animal is cursed. At night, T’m positive I’ve seen its eyes glowing as it follows me around... waiting to pounce.\nVICTOR: If you don’t like it so, why keep it?\nJOHN: It was in Woolstencroft’s will. ‘I bequeath my good doctor — the man who has prolonged my life for these last few years - my house, my maid and my vicious little beast of a cat.’\nJACQUELINE: (Putting down the cat) Go on then, out you go.\nJOHN: (Sitting down) Now shall we eat?\nJOHN: They sit down and begin to eat.\nVICTOR: (Chewing) Mmmm... John... this is superb...!”\nJACQUELINE: Victor! Don’t talk with your mouth full.\nVICTOR: (Laughing) Ah... there she goes again, John! Sorry, my\nVICTOR: blue-blooded beauty!\nVICTOR: 198\nJACQUELINE: (Stung) Victor!\nJOHN: (Quickly) Would anyone like more wine? Jacqueline? You're not eating?\nJACQUELINE: I don’t seem to have a knife...\nVOICE: (Whispers - almost subliminally) Gonna cut your throat.\nJOHN: Oh, I must apologise. Pll call for Jade.\nJACQUELINE: Ni no, I'll go and fetch one. It will give me a chance to see more of my ancestor’s workmanship.\nJOHN: If you wish. But, please, I do not be long.\nJACQUELINE: (Stands up) Gentlemen. JOHN and VICTOR stand. She leaves and they sit down again.\nJOHN: Is something wrong, Victor?!”\nVICTOR: What do you mean, old man?\nJOHN: Jacqueline and yourself — you both seem... on edge.\nVICTOR: If I didn’t know better, I'd swear you two had some sort of mystical ability, you know. (Pause) He’s killed again.\nJOHN: Damn! I should have been at the Sanatorium!\nVICTOR: Cinterrupis) You wouldn’t have been able to do anything, John. You can’t save them all.\nJOHN: I might have been able to.\nVICTOR: No John—\nJOHN: CInterrupts - agitated) I might have been able to—\nVICTOR: (interrupts — upset) John! You are the greatest surgeon\nVICTOR: Perfugium has ever known. Your skills are renowned throughout the town; you have saved more lives in the last ten years than many would believe possible. But... but there is nothing even you could do for a girl whose throat has been sliced so savagely as to make her head almost separate from her body. Even you could not save one whose chest has been ripped open and her heart removed. Her heart... (He trails off, unable to speak)\nJOHN: moves over to him.\nJOHN: (Quietly) Here... have some more wine.\nVICTOR: (Quietly) I’m sorry, old friend. I do not know why this one is affecting me more than the others. In our professions, John, we see death every. day but - I am sorry this is supposed to be a night of celebration.”\nJOHN: pours more wine.\nJOHN: (Passing the wine to VICTOR) Victor, my ersatz birthday fails in comparison to the unnatural taking of a human life.\nVICTOR: I had to tell her family. I had to... I destroyed that family.\nVICTOR: Do you know what that must, be like? Well, of course you don’t. (Slightly bitterly) You have no family.’\nJOHN: You and Jacqueline have been my family since I arrived here. You have cared for me and shown me love and friendship that I do not even know if I deserve. If I even try to imagine my life without you two... well, I can’t.\nVICTOR: (Drinks his wine) I’m sorry, old man. Must be getting old. Letting the job get to me. Would you mind if I got terribly drunk?\nJOHN: (Laughs) It’s my birthday and my house and so I say we shall all get ‘terribly drunk’ and you can forget about work, Jacqueline can forget about the Hostel and I shall forget about my dark past and we will have a good night even if it kills us to do so.\nJOHN: 199\nJOHN: SCENE 6: SILENCE. Silence, then very quickly...\nVOICE: (Whispers) You're going to die tonight. (Sniggers) This should be very sudden and quiet, almost subliminal.\nVOICE: SCENE 7: A CORRIDOR.\nJACQUELINE: is walking, her footsteps keeping the beat of the clock from the previous scene.\nJACQUELINE: (Calling out) Jade! Jade!\nJADE: (From a distance) I’m coming, ma’am.\nJACQUELINE: (Shivers, then to herself) Cold...”\nJACQUELINE: The whispering voice — sniggers — by now this is becoming more noticeable.\nJACQUELINE: (Calling out) Where are you?\nJACQUELINE: We hear a sound of scratching against woodwork.\nJADE: (From a distance) In the scullery, ma’am. I'm coming. The scratching gets louder.\nJACQUELINE: What is that?\nJADE: (From a distance) What’s what, ma’am?\nJADE: The scratching gets louder and more frantic.\nJADE: SAC! Hello? Is somebody there?\nJADE: The scratching gets louder and JACQUELINE stops walking. Her footsteps stop, the sound of her heartbeat fades up, getting faster. The scratching gets louder and more frantic and seems to be coming from all around her.\nJACQUELINE: (Starting to panic) What is that? Who’s there?\nJADE: (Suddenly loud in JACQUELINE’s ear) Ma’am?\nJADE: The heartbeat stops and the scratching becomes quiet.\nJACQUELINE: (Gasps) Jade!\nJADE: Ma'am?\nJACQUELINE: That noise...\nJADE: I’m afraid there might be some mice in the house, ma’am.\nJADE: Unfortunately the cat seems more interested in following the Master than in catching rodents. Are you—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) I’m fine. Now, the reason I called you is because the table has not been set correctly.\nJADE: Ma'am? JACQUELINE The table... My knife is missing.\nJADE: That's not possible!\nJACQUELINE: (Shocked at a servant speaking this way) 1 beg your\nJACQUELINE: pardon!\nJADE: I’m sorry, ma’am. I mean... I set three places. The Master,\nJADE: yourvelt and Inspector Schaeffer. Three forks, three spoons, and three ves.\nJACQUELINE: Well then, my knife would appear to have vanished into\nJACQUELINE: thin air. Perhaps you’d be so good as to fetch me another one.\nJACQUELINE: JADE Of course.\nJACQUELINE: They start walking.\nJADE: I will bring it to the dining room, ma‘am.\nJACQUELINE: I'd like a word with you first.\nJADE: Ma’am?\nJADE: 200\nJACQUELINE: How old are you, Jade?\nJADE: I will be twenty next month, ma’am.\nJACQUELINE: Twenty? That's very young.\nJADE: I was working for the old Master\nJACQUELINE: (interrupts) Mr Woolstencroft?\nJADE: That's right, ma’am. I joined Mr Woolstencroft’s service on my fourteenth birthday and then, after his death, I stayed on for the new Master. JACQUELINE And how do you find your new Master?\nJADE: He is a good man. And very learned. He’s not like the men from the town. He reads books!\nJACQUELINE: Books, eh? Well!\nJADE: Is something wrong, ma’am? Only you seem — oh, here’s the kitchens, I'll fetch you that knife.\nJADE: opens the door and they enter the scullery as they continue talking.\nJACQUELINE: How much do you know about your new Master, Jade?\nJADE: I know there is a mystery about him, but that is all. aye if you could tell me more..\nJADE: John Smith is a wonderful man. He is the Kindest, most porters man I have ever met.\nJADE: But Inspector Schaeffer—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts with an embarrassed giggle) Oh, of course, except for the good Inspector. But we know where Inspector Schaeffer came from, don’t we?”\nJADE: I’m not sure I understand, ma’am. Here’s your knife.\nJACQUELINE: Thank you. I know your Master’s appearance is, at first, off-putting and I know that his amnesia can cause worry as to what his past—\nJADE: CInterrupts, struggling with the word) ‘Amnesia’ ma’am?”\nJACQUELINE: His lack of memory. (Beat) Let me explain. Doctor John Smith, was found wandering the streets of Perfugium ten years ago today. He has no memory of his previous life, no memory of who he was. Because of his physical appearance we believe he may have survived a terrible accident, perhaps a fire. We do know that he is clearly a good man My husband and I are here for his birthday.”\nJADE: Birthday? But if he has no memory—\nJACQUELINE: Indeed. This is not his real birthday. This is a celebration of the ten years he has spent in our town.\nJADE: I did not know any of that, ma’am, thank you. May I ask...\nJACQUELINE: Yes?\nJADE: Well... he does not know where he is from?”\nJACQUELINE: That’s correct. He is a man of mystery and I know (Pauses) I know how intriguing that can be to a young woman.\nJADE: He is an intriguing gentleman.\nJACQUELINE: Yes... he is. Of course, he wouldn't be interested in a girl such as yourself.\nJADE: (Shocked) Ma‘am, I-\nJACQUELINE: (interrupts) Oh, please do not take offence. I’m sure a pretty young girl like you has the pick of many a young man. It’s just\nJACQUELINE: 201\nJACQUELINE: that I know of a number of young women who have believed that because of his missing memory, because of his physical disability... well, Tm sure we understand each other.\nJADE: I think we do, ma‘am. If you'll excuse me, I must prepare dessert.\nJACQUELINE: Oh good! What is it?\nJADE: Marinated figs with a raspberry coulis. The Master’s favourite.\nJACQUELINE: Wonderful. If you'll excuse me...\nJACQUELINE: JADE Of course, ma’am.\nJACQUELINE: leaves the kitchen. Fade down.\nJACQUELINE: SCENE 8: INT. THE DINING ROOM. Fade up as VICTOR talking. The clock ticking. They are all eating and talking boisterously.\nVICTOR: .. well, I don’t understand it, I really don’t.\nJACQUELINE: it’s who I am.\nVICTOR: But to consort with criminals?\nJOHN: Oh, come on now, Victor. We cannot categorise them so simply.\nVICTOR: It is a fact universally acknowledged that those without\nVICTOR: homes or a decent family upbringing descend rapidly into a criminal lifestyle. Pickpockets, prostitutes and the rest.\nJACQUELINE: But if we try and help them—\nVICTOR: (interrupts) Which is very noble, my dear, but why you? Why do you feel the need, with your privileged upbringing, to run a hostel for them?\nJACQUELINE: Perhaps because of my upbringing? Since I was a child, I have had it drummed into me that I am somehow superior\nVICTOR: CInterrupts) Ah! So, it is out of guilt?\nJOHN: (Laughing) And I thought I was the one who always looked for motives, Victor!\nJACQUELINE: But I would never talk down to another merely because of their upbringing...\nJACQUELINE: Her voice merges into the following lines as the conversation and the evening continues.\nVICTOR: ..crime, crime, crime! I mean, what say you, John?””\nJOHN: I’m afraid I agree with your wife. I believe that all life is precious. I am surprised you feel otherwise. I thought you disapproved of social superiority.\nVICTOR: It’s not that. I’m not explaining myself very well. It is not what you are born into but what you do with your life. The girl today... the girl we found. She wasn’t a whore like the others. Do not tell me that. her life was therefore not of more importance!l”*\nVICTOR: JACQUELINE Of course it wasn’t! The others may have been-\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts) Be honest, Jacqueline! Who of us here does not place such judgements? We hear of a death. Our first reaction is one of sadness. We then discover that the victim was a prostitute or a member of a criminal gang and we immediately, almost unconsciously,\nVICTOR: fee] that it is therefore of less importance. That, perhaps, in some small way, they deserved it.\nVICTOR: 202\nJOHN: Much as I hate to agree, agree I must. Perhaps, it is part of what makes us... human. However, I do believe that Jacqueline’s work is imperative if we are to improve...\nJOHN: Again his voice merges into the following lines as the evening moves forward.\nJOHN: JACQUELINE And you still have had no luck?\nJOHN: No. I must have read a thousand or more books in an attempt to jog my memory. I have visited hypnotists, and specialists, and only the Empress knows who else, and yet still I have found no way to light the darkness in my mind. But let us not dwell on it. Not tonight.\nJADE: enters.\nJOHN: Aah! Here’s Jade with dessert! More wine, Victor?\nJOHN: Again his voice merges into the folowing lines as the evening moves forward.\nVICTOR: .» and so I said, ‘Fetch me everything on the menu!’ They all laugh.\nJOHN: (Laughing) How they must appreciate your patronage, Victor!\nJACQUELINE: (Laughing) Victor! Are you drunk?\nVICTOR: What? No. No, no, no, no! Well, yes actually...\nVICTOR: They all laugh.\nVICTOR: But while I am standing. (He stumbles) Oops!\nJOHN: (Laughing) Just about!\nVICTOR: I want to make a speech... no, a toast! (Seriously) These\nVICTOR: last few days have not been easy for us. John, old friend, you have been ill and are no nearer to understanding what... well, what you are! I have seen... seen things I would not wish on anyone... and I don't just mean that blasted musical!\nVICTOR: They laugh.\nVICTOR: But... but tonight is a night to forget all that and to... well let’s have no more talk of death!\nJACQUELINE: Hear he-\nVICTOR: (interrupts) Or curses!\nJOHN: Quite—\nVICTOR: CInterrupts) Or proph— procephies... prophecies!\nJACQUELINE: I think-\nVICTOR: CInterrupts) And let us celebrate! It’s good old Doctor\nVICTOR: John Smith’s birthday! (His voice starts turning nastier) Except it isn’t of course.\nVICTOR: A heartbeat starts to fade up, getting louder and faster.\nJACQUELINE: (Amused) I’m sorry, John. He was drinking before we arrived here.\nVOICE: (Whispers) You know what he is!\nVICTOR: (Suddenly shrieks) The blood! I can smell it on my hands!\nJACQUELINE: (Terrified) Victor! John, perhaps-\nVICTOR: CInterrupts shrieking) Shut up! Don’t turn to him! He\nVICTOR: doesn’t even know who he is! Who are you John, ‘old friend'? You can’t remember! What are you hiding? And look at you! What are you? (He throws his glass at the wall causing JACQUELINE to scream. Shouts) What are you?\nVICTOR: The heartbeat suddenly stops as VICTOR falls silent.\nVICTOR: 203\nVICTOR: (Quietly) Dear God... John, I am so sorry. I don’t even know what I’m saying...” ;\nJACQUELINE: Victor? What's happening to you?\nVICTOR: I don’t... I don’t know! John! I am so truly sorty., Please, I must have drunk more wine than I thought. Please forgive me!*\nJACQUELINE: John?\nJOHN: I did not know you thought this way, Victor.\nVICTOR: I don’t! It’s as if something is in my head... (The whispering voice sniggers) trying to... I cannot apologise enough John! JOHN And you, Jacqueline? Do you believe that I am hiding something?\nJACQUELINE: No. of course not! And neither does Victor. Do you, Victor?\nVICTOR: No! Please, old friend!*'\nJOBH: You are obviously under a great deal of pressure. The\nJOBH: horrors you have seen recently must have... well, it must be very difficult. But, I assure you, Victor, I am not trying to hide anything. I\nJOBH: would give anything to know my past. Anything to know what... who I am.\nVICTOR: 1 know you would! I don’t understand why I... perhaps I should seek medical help... I don’t...\nVICTOR: d0nN (Humorously) And now you're questioning my skills as a doctor?\nVICTOR: (Laughs) No, of course not. (Quieter) I am sorry.\nJOHN: It is partly my fault. Home-made wine is always stronger...\nVICTOR: Yes... perhaps I should not have drunk so much.*”\nJOHN: It is forgotten. The murders are making you see shadows\nJOHN: where there are none. You see the world... no you see people as good or bad... law-abiding citizens or criminals... and you believe that it is something in them that causes them to be this way. Perhaps, because we do not Know what I was, you find it harder to categorise me?\nVICTOR: But I do know. You are a good doctor and a damn good friend! Why would I wish- 7\nJOHN: (Interrupts) Please, let us think nothing of it. We should\nJOHN: retire to the study.\nJACQUELINE: (Still quite shocked) Ob yes... and there’s your present...\nJOHN: (Drily) Really? 1 assumed Victor’s performance there was my gift. An extract from Portentum, no?\nVICTOR: laughs but still shocked at his own outburst.\nJOHN: Just promise me one thing, Victor?\nVICTOR: (Desperate) Anything John.\nJOHN: Don’t start singing!\nJOHN: SCENE 9: THE KITCHEN.\nJOHN: Fade up. JADE is washing the dishes. She is humming the ‘Zagreus’ tune and then gradually the words come to her.\nJADE: (Singing to herself) ‘They say he sits inside your head, and he sees you in your bed...’ (Pauses) What a strange tune! Now what do you suppose put that in my head, eh???\nJADE: The cat mews.\nJADE: No... no, of course you don’t know. You're only a cat! Now,\nJADE: 204\nJADE: let’s see if the Master left some food for you... (continues singing) ‘... and eats you when you're sleeping... 34 Fade down just as the whispering voice sniggers once more.\nJADE: SCENE 10: INT. THE STUDY. Fade up. The clock is ticking and we can hear the wind starting to pick up outside.\nJOHN: That wind is really starting to pick up!\nVICTOR: Yes. It doesn’t sound too pleasant, does it? John, thank you for being so understanding about earlier.\nJOHN: Victor, you’re my oldest friend. You helped keep me sane\nJOHN: when my mind was empty. I owe you so much.\nJACQUELINE: (Coughs) Ah-hem!\nJACQUELINE: JOHN And you too, of course. But, as tonight is my birthday I feel that it should be all about me! Enough talk about you two! I would like to open my present!\nJACQUELINE: I’m not sure if it’s such a good idea now...\nJOHN: Come on! What is it?\nJACQUELINE: It’s just tonight... well... what is it you want more than anything John?\nJACQUELINE: JOHN A bottomless pot of gold and dominion over all of Perfugium!\nJOHN: laughs a fake, OTT evil laugh which VICTOR joins in with.\nJACQUELINE: No, really. I’m being serious.”\nJOHN: Well. . to know who I am. To know what I have forgotten.\nJACQUELINE: takes the present and hands it to JOHN.\nJACQUELINE: Well... perhaps this will oh, it seems silly now after everything else that’: s happening but—\nJOHN: CInterrupts intrigued) What is it?™\nJACQUELINE: Yesterday, at the Hostel, we had a visitor. A remarkable man whom we helped. So he gave me these!\nJACQUELINE: She pours the stones onto the table.\nJOHN: What are they?\nVICTOR: Stones!\nJOHN: (Laughs) Victor, your deductive powers astound me once\nJOHN: more! (He picks up one of the stones) They seem to be engraved, no... branded. How can they help me?\nJACQUELINE: It’s quite simple. We place them in a circle (She dogs this as she speaks) and then take a glass... put it in the middle and..\nVICTOR: (Laughing) And?\nJACQUELINE: (Fmbarrassed) And communicate with the spirits!\nJACQUELINE: JOHN and VICTOR laugh.\nJACQUELINE: Well, if you're both just going to ridicule the idea...\nJOHN: (Tries to stop laughing) No... no, I’m sorry Jacqueline... it was a wonderful thought and who knows.. i science has failed to answer our questions. Well, Victor, are you game?”\nVICTOR: (Still laughing) Why not! So, come on darling? What must we do?\nJACQUELINE: (Laughing despite herself Well, stop laughing for onel And that goes for you too, Doctor Smith!”\nJOHN: I'm sorry.\nJOHN: 205\nJACQUELINE: We each need to place a finger on the glass.\nJACQUELINE: They do this.\nJACQUELINE: Now we need to concentrate.\nVICTOR: On?\nVICTOR: JACQUELINE On the glass, Victor!\nVICTOR: VICTOR Of course, how foolish of me!\nJACQUELINE: Concentrate!\nJOHN: (Whispers) What's supposed to happen?\nJACQUELINE: Apparently, if a spirit chooses to communicate with us then the glass will start moving. He or she will start spelling out their name and then... then we can ask it questions!\nJACQUELINE: JOHN And you think the spirits will know who I was?\nJACQUELINE: Well... no one else does.\nJACQUELINE: There is silence except for the clock ticking and the wind outside. We can also hear JOHN’s, JACQUELINE’s and VICTOR’s breathing increasing in volume and slowing down, becoming almost hypnotic.\nVOICE: (Whispers quickly) Behind you- gonna cut your throat! They don’t hear the voice and for a short while we just hear their breathing then the glass starts to move, slowly scraping across the table.\nJACQUELINE: (Whispers) It’s moving... spelling out a name... D... O... Cuties\nJACQUELINE: We just hear the glass moving slowly. The main sound we can hear throughout is the breathing. Ali three of them are breathing at the same time and the sound is hypnotic and continues for quite a while until suddenly there is a loud flash of lightning and we hear the DOCTOR scream outside in agony. The glass flies against the wall and smashes and JACQUELINE screams and these mix with the DOCTOR’s scream as they crescendo into:\nJACQUELINE: Crash theme. End of Part One.\nJACQUELINE: 206"

By my reckoning, your story has about five minutes before I lose my concentration and go back to killing people.\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t worry — killing and death is about to play a very important part in the proceedings. Now, where was I?\nDOCTOR: The reprise from Part One starts from JACQUELINE’s comment about spelling out the name...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12; INT. THE STUDY.\nJACQUELINE: is moaning slightly, as if she’s having a migraine.\nVICTOR: Jacqueline! You're bleeding!\nJOHN: Keep still, let me- *\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) A man..\nJOHN: Keep stilll Here, wrap this around the wound. JACQUELINE A man!\nVICTOR: Ssh. Calm down, Jacqueline. We just let our imagination—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) No! A man at the window!\nJACQUELINE: VICTOR The window?\nJACQUELINE: JOHN A man?\nJACQUELINE: JACQUELINE A man at the window! His face... *\nVICTOR: Did you know him?*?\nJACQUELINE: His face... it was contorted... he was in agony!\nJOHN: Well, your bleeding seems to have stopped. Victor, fetch your coat.\nVICTOR: (Moving to the door) Ahead of you, old boy.\nJACQUELINE: Where are you going?\nJOHN: I'm a doctor. If there is an injured man, I must-\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) No! No, leave him...\nVICTOR: (Shocked) Jacquel- “\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) Please! I beg of you! I saw his face! I know this man means us harm!\nVICTOR: Don’t be ridiculous. *\nJOHN: Ssh, Jacqueline. Sit down and wait here. We won’t be long. JOHN and VICTOR run out of the room.\nJACQUELINE: (Quietly) He means us harm...\nJACQUELINE: The whispering voice sniggers.\nJACQUELINE: SCENE 13: EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.\nJACQUELINE: The storm is picking up - lots of rain and thunder. JOHN and VICTOR shout over the wind.\nJOHN: (Shouts) Can you see him?\nVICTOR: (Shouts) This blasted rain... can't see a blood- (Suddenly) I’ve found him!\"\nVICTOR: 207\nJOHN: (Shouts) Where? Where are you?\nVICTOR: (Shouts) Over here! He looks in a bad way, John!\nJOHN: (Shouts) Don’t move him! (Quieter as he reaches VICTOR) Here. We'll have to get him inside.\nJOHN: SCENE 14: INT. THE STUDY. .\nJOHN: The clock is still ticking and the storm can be heard from outside.\nJADE: Ma'am? You called for me.\nJACQUELINE: Yes... Doctor Smith and my husband are bringing in an injured man. He might need you to prepare-\nJACQUELINE: She is interrupted by the sound of JOHN and VICTOR bursting into the room, carrying the unconscious DOCTOR.\nJOHN: (Struggling) Over here... They lay the DOCTOR down on the table.\nJOHN: He seems to be burned.\nVICTOR: Struck by the lightning?\nJOHN: Yes. I expect so.\nJACQUELINE: Is there anything we can do? The whispering voice starts chanting the ‘Zagreus’ rhyme — fading up from silence but not too loud.\nJOHN: Good. Now go and fetch some- (Annoyed) What is that? Can anyone else hear it?\nVICTOR: What?\nJOHN: That whispering... that—\nJOHN: He is interrupted by a groan from the DOCTOR.\nJACQUELINE: He’s waking up!\nJOHN: Good. Now go and fetch ~ one moment! I... I... I think... he seems familiar...\nJACQUELINE: You know who he is?\nJOHN: I don’t know. His face...\nJOHN: The DOCTOR groans once more as the whispering voice gets louder.\nJADE: Master?\nJOHN: His face... Can you hear me? Who are you?\nJACQUELINE: His eyes...\nVICTOR: They're opening...\nJOHN: Who are you?\nJOHN: There is a pause in which suddenly the whispering voice and the clock stop.\nJOHN: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Death!\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR then screams again.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 18: INT. THE APARTMENT. We hear the slight car horns and crowds.\nMAN: Well... that’s nice! This really is a cheerful tale!\nDOCTOR: Well, I never said it would be a happy story.\nDOCTOR: So... ’'m about to kill someone and to convince me that life is for living you're telling me a story about a group of hypocrites who-\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupts) Hypocrites?\nMAN: Yes! That Jacqueline. One minute she’s all sweetness and light, the next she’s having a go at the maid.\nMAN: 208\nDOCTOR: Jade?\nMAN: Yes, Jade. And Victor! He’s no better. (Bluster) ‘You old rogue’ and yet he obviously doesn’t trust John. In fact, John seems to be the only sane one in the house and he doesn’t even know who he is! And as for that bloke they’ve found - ‘Who are you?’ (Dramatically) ‘Death!’ He's obviously going to be another nutter.\nDOCTOR: (Slight laugh) Really?\nMAN: Yeah! Listen, mate, if you’re going to tell a story you should put at least one likeable character in it. Is this a ghost story?”\nDOCTOR: It’s a true story. So do you believe in ghosts?\nMAN: Dunno. But, yeah! Maybe the ghost of Sir Wotsit is channelling itself through John and that- *\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupts cheerfully) Are you telling this story or am I?\nMAN: Oh yeah, sorry.”\nDOCTOR: Now then, the man spoke. And the word he spoke was\nDOCTOR: ‘death’. Victor ushered the ladies out of the room and left John to care for his patient.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 16: INT. THE STUDY. THE DOCTOR is screaming. The scream blocks out all other sound.\nDOCTOR: (Voiceover) The man’s clothes had charred slightly from the lightning strike. With care, John removed them and wrapped the man’s skin, where necessary, in wet towels to try and ease the pain. John was a good man who believed that all life was precious. But there was more to this patient. His face, the burnt clothes, even the man’s endless scream. All these battered at the barrier in his mind, threatening to destroy it, threatening to allow him memory of what once he had been.” The screams stop. We hear the DOCTOR breathing short, harsh breaths.\nDOCTOR: (Voiceover) And then... the patient became still. John, exhausted from the work he had done, fell into a reverie. He sat next to the patient, his other guests forgotten. This could be it! After ten years, this could be it!\nDOCTOR: The breathing fades down and is replaced by the clock ticking and the storm outside.\nJOHN: (Quietly) After ten years, this could be it! (Pause) Who are you?\nJOHN: The DOCTOR coughs.\nJOHN: (Quietly) Can you hear me? Hello? Let me get you some water.\nDOCTOR: (Still semi-conscious) Where... where....\nJOHN: Ssh. Ssh. Here, drink this.”\nJOHN: He gives the DOCTOR some water to drink. The DOCTOR wakes up and, seeing JOHN, gasps.\nJOHN: Hello. Try not to move.\nJOHN: pOocTOR Where am I?\nJOHN: JOHN In my study. I... ’m sorry but do you know me? Do you recognise me?\nDOCTOR: What? Is this some kind of joke?\nJOHN: No! I am sorry, it’s just... your face. It seems familiar to me.\nDOCTOR: You don’t know who I am?\nDOCTOR: 209\nJOHN: Wo... do you know who I am?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you? .\nJOHN: No. Well... currently I am Doctor Smith, resident physician here in Perfugium.\nDOCTOR: Perfugium? 3\nJOHN: Yes. Do you not know where you are?\nDOCTOR: (Mutters) Perfugium! Oh, not now. I’m not ready. (To\nJOHN: decisively) I am sorry. I have never met you before.\nJOHN: Oh. Are you sure? It’s just that when you first awoke—\nJOHN: (realises) oh, it was my appearance, wasn’t it? Do not be shocked by my disturbing aspect. I no longer am. To be honest, it is the one constant from my life before Perfugium. Every day I stare at my own reflection, willing it to... but, I’m sorry. I am not being much of a host, or a doctor. How are you feeling?”\nDOCTOR: I have felt better.\nJOHN: You may not feel it now but you are a lucky man.™\nDOCTOR: Lucky?\nJOHN: Perfugium is no longer a safe town. We are plagued by a mourderer.\nDOCTOR: Really? I thought when the colonists settled here, they\nDOCTOR: based their society on what they perceived as a highly moralistic template. Very Edwardian. Terribly hot on morals, those Edwardians. (Quietly) And hypocrisy.\nJOHN: (Not hearing the last bit) Yes. It is a shocking affair. I presume you are not from Perfugium yourself? (Pause) No, I thought not.\nDOCTOR: Will you tell me about the murders?\nJOHN: Why do you want to know about them?\nDOCTOR: I came to Perfugium to find a friend of mine.\nJOHN: Oh. You fear they may be dead?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t heard from them in quite a while.*\nJOHN: Well, there have been twelve murders so far. Eleven of the\nJOHN: victims were prostitutes. The twelfth... a young girl of only fourteen. They were all found with their throats cut and then... I am sorry, but are you sure you want to hear about this?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That’s why I'm here. (Pause) Well, one of the reasons. Please, continue.\nJOHN: If you are sure. The girls' bodies were also sliced open and their hearts removed.\nDOCTOR: That's terrible.\nJOHN: I know.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And were there any other connections between the murders? Were they committed in the same place? At similar times?”\nJOHN: No. The only other... well, they were all found covered in green blankets or sheets. Like shrouds.\nDOCTOR: Green?\nJOHN: It is the colour of death, here in Perfugium. It represents the return to nature.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nJOHN: How are you feeling?\nDOCTOR: I'm fine - this is all rather confusing for me.\nJOHN: Do you really believe your friend to have been one of the\nJOHN: victims? What was her name?\nJOHN: 210\nDOCTOR: No... my friend wasn’t one of the victims. He must still be missing...\nJOHN: Well, perhaps I can help you there. Victor Schaeffer, a very good friend of mine, is the local inspector. He might be able to find your missing friend. He was the other gentleman who- *\nDOCTOR: CInterrupts, excited) Others. There are others here!\nJOHN: Yes... They are in the dining room. Victor, that’s Inspector Schaeffer, and his wife.\nDOCTOR: Can I ask... how are you helping Inspector Schaeffer? I\nDOCTOR: would have presumed that the murder victims were beyond the help of a doctor.\nJOHN: Victor is an intelligent man with great deductive skills but... have you ever had dealings with an Adjudicator?\nDOCTOR: I have known one or two.\nJOHN: They can be... a little limited. Their investigations rely\nJOHN: solely on facts that can be proven. I am a doctor of the physical body but I am also something of an amateur psychologist.\nDOCTOR: Ah! (Looking around) So I see from your books!**\nJOHN: (Excited) Ah, yes, my books! It’s something of a collection, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Indeed it is!\nJOHN: walks around the study, removing books as he speaks.\nJOHN: Each book in this room deals with the mind. I own\nJOHN: medical texts written by highly regarded professionals... here, The Divided Self by Doctor Julia Steer... amateur scribblings such as... ah, here, Man: Two Hearts in One Mind by Professor Summerfield and... then noted works of fiction, Dostoevsky... Stevenson... Welsh. All deal with what it is that makes us who we are. All trying to understand the human condition.\nVOICE: (Whispers almost subliminally) Human? (Sniggers) DOCTOR A remarkable collection!\nVOICE: JOHN The subject interests you?\nDOCTOR: Oh, greatly. May I...?\nJOHN: By all means! It’s so refreshing to meet another like\nJOHN: myself. But, do be careful. Your wounds are healing at a really quite extraordinary rate, but you may stil- © The DOCTOR gets up.\nDOCTOR: It appears that I am mostly uninjured. Thank you for saving my-\nJOHN: Cinterrupts) Oh, think nothing of it! Now... here...\nDOCTOR: (Reading) ‘One point that required clearing up was,\nDOCTOR: whether the crime is the result of disease, or whether the crime, by virtue of its nature, is not always accompanied by some morbid phenomena; but this the young man. did not feel himself able, as yet, to solve. While’\nJOHN: CUnterrupts) ‘...reasoning thus, he persuaded himself that he, personally, was secure against any such mental weakness, and that he was capable of retaining his resolution and intelligence throughout his enterprise for the simple reason that the latter was not a crime’ Dostoevsky - a remarkable writer.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. So have you been able to profile the killer?\nJOHN: Alas, no. I am not quite as skilled as these others... I can see that there are patterns... but, recently, I have begun to... well...\nJOHN: 211\nDOCTOR: What? ;\nJOHN: It is difficult to explain. I have begun to question whether indeed there must always be a motive... whether, indeed, that a killer must always have a reason, no matter how twisted, to kill.\nDOCTOR: But what other explanation is there?\nJOHN: Well I... I'm sorry, I've just realised I do not know your name!\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes... Well, I am a doctor, like yourself. Doctor Smi- Sutton. Vaughan Sutton.\nJOHN: Well, Doctor Let me ask you something. All these books\nJOHN: here try to unravel the motives of why people behave in the way that they do. But... what if, in some cases, there is no motive? No reason? Tell me, Doctor, do you believe in evil?\nJOHN: The whispering voice sniggers.\nDOCTOR: Why do you-\nJOHN: (Interrupts) Do you believe that evil, as a concept, exists? bDocTOR Somebody... somebody once told me that exposure to evil, even the smallest amount, can corrode the soul.\nJOHN: So they believed it be substantial... tangible perhaps? And what did you say?\nDOCTOR: Well... that evil is relative.\nJOHN: So you don’t believe in it then?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I believe that people can commit terrible acts, such as murder, but there is usually a motive.\nJOHN: But not always?\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nJOHN: (Quite excitable) I mean... I don’t know... there isn’t\nJOHN: always a motive. What if someone commits murder just because, that’s who — that’s what — they are?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I see. You mean if nature as opposed to nurture has defined them?\nJOHN: Exactly. Have you ever met anyone who could be described thus?\nDOCTOR: I have met a number of... criminals... killers in my time but they usually have a motive. There is usually a reason that makes sense to them, at least. But... there was one man...\nJOHN: He had no motive for what he did?\nDOCTOR: Nothing that could be explained, no. He was a terrible man, responsible for the deaths of a countless number. I used to try and dismiss him as a madman or as...\nJOHN: As evil?\nDOCTOR: Yes. As a monster.\nJOHN: It’s far more comfortable to point a finger and declare\nJOHN: someone a devil than to call upon your imagination to try and understand their world. Because your imagination is a reflection of yourself... a\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, so by admitting you understand ‘them’ then you must be acknowledging a similarity between yourself and the monster?\nJOHN: Exactly! But... what if it’s true? What if, say, the man you\nJOHN: are talking about, is purely evil? What if no amount of analysis or trying to understand would explain why he did what he did?\nDOCTOR: He was an old friend of mine. Then... an old foe. He used to call himself ‘the Master’.\nDOCTOR: 212\nJOHN: (Thoughtful) The Master? That name—\nDOCTOR: Cnterrupts) It is perhaps best that we do not talk of him.\nJOHN: Were you close to him?\nJOHN: DOCTOR At one time... yes.\nJOHN: So, presumably, once he—\nDOCTOR: CInterrupts) ’'m sorry. I really would rather not talk about him.\nDOCTOR: JOHN Of course. I am sorry. Anyway, I then began to wonder\nDOCTOR: that if all those who had no motive, those who we thought of as ‘evil’ might instead be technically classified as insane. Psychotic, perhaps. DOCTOR A friend of mine ~ she was also something of an amateur psychologist - once said to me that ‘the critical test of whether or not a person is psychotic is a lack of congruity - an incongruity, a clash between him and me. Of course, she’d had a little too much wine at the time.\nJOHN: You mean that there might not be such a thing as sanity or madness - merely a different way of seeing the universe? Of seeing each other?\nDOCTOR: Do you see me as I see myself? Do I see you as you see yourself? When you see the colour red do you see the same colour red that I see? Or is your red my blue?\nJOHN: So... one who suffers such an affliction is merely trying to help the rest of the universe see the same colour red?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps...\nJOHN: So there is no such thing as evil. It doesn’t exist. DOCTOR A man who kills because of motives can be questioned. A\nJOHN: man who kills because he is ill, can be certainly helped. A man who kills because... well, because he was born, fated even, to be evil? Well, that is a true tragedy in itself.\nJOHN: (To himself) Knowing you were evil and no matter what you did to try and stop yourself...\nDOCTOR: But, may I ask why you have started to think this way?\nDOCTOR: You say you used to believe that there must be motive behind every action?\nJOHN: Yes... it is odd. Perhaps it’s this house. I inherited it from an old patient of mine. It is said to be cursed. Nonsense, of course. But... since moving in I have felt as if... as if there is a presence or something... something is making me have thoughts that I am sure are not my own and yet... yet they feel right!\nDOCTOR: Thoughts?\nJOHN: Oh, I am certain it is nothing. As you may have gathered, lam suffering from a form of amnesia. I have no memory or recollection of my life from before I arrived in Perfugium.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And when was that?\nJOHN: Ten years ago. I stumbled into Jacqueline’s hostel ~ that’s Inspector Schaeffer's wife... she runs 2 kind of hostel for the homeless and deprived... well, I stumbled in there without any knowledge of who I was or where I came from. But (slight laugh) look at my face... I clearly have some history!™\nJOHN: DOCTOR And your interest in psychology stems from this?\nJOHN: Yes. I have been trying to discover what could cause a\nJOHN: Iman to entirely forget his whole life. A traumatic incident of some sort.\nJOHN: 213\nJOHN: Perhaps a fire, which would explain my physical condition as well as my mental one.\nJOHN: DOCTOR A fire?\nJOHN: Let us sit down. I will tel you but you mustn't breathe a word of this to the others. They are my closest friends and I couldn’t bear it if they feared me.\nJOHN: They sit down.\nJOHN: It is odd that I feel I can talk to you! As if we have known each other for years. Although perhaps it's because we haven’t known each other for years\nDOCTOR: Yes... perhaps.\nJOHN: Well... (Pauses) I had the first one about three months ago, not long after I moved into this house. I... I was helping a young lady give birth. She has been a patient of mine for a while and everything was going well. She pushed forth that new life into our world and I held him in my arms. A beautiful baby boy, so innocent his eyes weren't even open to the world. And as I held him I had this image... this thought that I could smash him to the floor! I could throw him with all my force and watch his helpless little body fall apart as it hit the ground, the blood splashing across the sterile white tiles. I could take his life as easily as I had helped bring him into the world!”\nDOCTOR: But you didn’t?\nDOCTOR: JOHN Of course not! I could never harm anyone, especially not a newborn child! But... but why did I think it? Why would I? Unless, it is some kind of flashback to my previous life. But then, what would be my motive for such an act? It would be an act of pure evil!\nVOICE: (Whispers almost subliminally) Are you evil?\nDOCTOR: So you fear that, despite everything, deep down inside of you... you are evil? These fantasies... you fear they may be representative of what you once were?’\nJOHN: I do not know. I hope not. I would almost prefer to believe in the curse.\nDOCTOR: Ab, yes, this curse—\nJOHN: Cinterrupts) Oh it is obvious and clichéd...\nJOHN: many years ago there was a death in this house and people believe that those who live here will suffer from madness or fall victim to a violent death.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And the others? Your friends? Have they been affected?\nJOHN: Well... that is why I have invited them here. I cannot believe, myself, that I have been so manipulative but... I invited them here to see if they would notice anything. Victor, like I say, is a very pragmatic man, almost stubborn in his belief in facts and facts alone. Jacqueline, on the other hand, is almost foolish in her readiness to believe in anything.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And has anything happened tonight?\nJOHN: (Laughing) You mean other than the rather obvious cliché of a mystery man arriving in a storm?\nDOCTOR: (Laughs) Other than that, yes.\nJOHN: Well, Victor suddenly turned on me earlier. He seems to\nJOHN: be being affected by something. I actually feel quite guilty for inviting him here. The latest murder has affected him deeply and I'm sure whatever is happening tonight cannot be helping. Also, he seems to be forming prejudices... he almost seems to believe that criminals are the way they are, because of what they are!\nJOHN: 214\nDOCTOR: Nature not nurture again?\nJOHN: Yes! Oh, it is so refreshing to meet- ””\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupts) I must ask you something.\nJOHN: I think I know what it will be but, go on.\nJOHN: DOCTOR The murders...\nJOHN: Am I committing them?\nDOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't want to be as blunt as—\nJOHN: CInterrupts) I can see you are an intelligent man, Doctor,\nJOHN: and I would have been most surprised if that most obvious of conclusions hadn't occurred to you. Here I am, a man with no memory of what I once was, a man who fears that something may be happening to him, a man almost morbidly obsessed with the concept of evil and what motive man might have for murder... and a terrible wave of murders are currently being committed by, one can only assume, a madman,\nDOCTOR: ‘Well, if I am the clichéd man from nowhere then...\nJOHN: I am the clichéd madman helping the Inspector whilst in actuality committing the crimes.\nDOCTOR: So how can you be sure that it is not you?\nJOHN: For a while, I feared it was. But then, a few days ago, I\nJOHN: disturbed an intruder.A man, I don’t know who he was, was in here rifling through that cabinet over there. I was so angry with him... I actually felt sick with anger at this creature going through my own personal belongings. I crept up behind him and raised a poker, ready to strike! And then I froze. I could not do it! It must have looked almost comical as I stood there trying to regain control of my own arm. But I could not. He turned around, knocked me down and left. So you see Doctor, it is impossible for me to kill.\nDOCTOR: Well, that doesn’t really prove—\nJOHN: (Interrupts) Maybe not. But it is what I believe. Whatever these thoughts are, they are not of my own making. And Victor's behaviour tonight is proving my theory that there is something in this house. Be it a curse, or a ghost. It’s either that... or madness.\nJOHN: A book falls off the shelf.\nJOHN: Ha ha! See, the ghost doesn’t like us talking about him.\nDOCTOR: Hither that or he doesn’t like your taste in books!\nJOHN: So, the question is... will you stay and help us?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I really think I should be going.\nDOCTOR: JOHN The storm is still raging outside, Doctor. You wouldn’t get very far.\nDOCTOR: No... no, I wouldn’t would I?\nDOCTOR: JON Of course, I won't press the matter. There are strange\nDOCTOR: things Bevpering but I am sure that we have nothing to fear.\nDOCTOR: DOCTO! You don’t sound totally convinced.\nDOCTOR: sce (Smiles) No. Of course, I am scared. I am a doctor and a scientist and here I am talking of curses and ghosts! I do not pretend to understand what is happening which is why I need my friends around me and, odd though it may seem, with us only just having met, I feel we too could be friends. I sense a likeness in us — perhaps that is why I thought I recognised you. I feel we are quite similar, you and I, Doctor.\nBOCTOR: Perhaps we were friends in a past life.\nJOHN: (Laughing) I can just about accept ghosts and goblins but reincarnation? So you will stay?\nJOHN: 215\nDOCTOR: I'd be honoured and delighted. It will be good to get to know—\nJOHN: (Suddenly gasps and drops his glass)\nDOCTOR: John!\nJOHN: shrieks.\nDOCTOR: John! What is it?\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) Not John...\nJOHN: DOCTOR The Master!\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) Oh, no... not yet. Don’t you recognise me?\nDOCTOR: You! I won't do it. I can’t do it!\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) You think he’s your friend again, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Please!\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) There will be death in this house before the sun rises!\nDOCTOR: No! I tell you now, I will not do it!\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) There will be death, Doctor, and it will be of your doing! You cannot escape fate!\nJOHN: DOCTOR And if I don’t?\nJOHN: (Possessed/whispering) All who hear my voice shall die!\nJOHN: laughs. which then turns into coughing as JOHN is returned to his own body. He collapses to the floor.\nDOCTOR: (Runs over to him) John! John!*\nJOHN: (Coughs) I am... I am fine. Why am I on the floor?\nDOCTOR: You collapsed.\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR helps JOHN to stand.\nJOHN: (Laughs) Fine pair of doctors we make, eh? Again, please\nJOHN: don’t tell the others. Jacqueline especially will only worry needlessly.\nDOCTOR: I won't.\nJOHN: I shall go and fetch them. Help yourself to more wine.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nJOHN: leaves, closing the door behind him. A beat as we hear the storm outside.\nDOCTOR: (To himself) He really has no idea. A book falls off the sheif.\nDOCTOR: Now, which book is my clumsy poltergeist trying to draw\nDOCTOR: my attention too, hmm? (Moving over and picking up the book. To himself) Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde — oh, very apt. (He places the book back on the shelf) There-\nDOCTOR: He is interrupted by another book falling off the shelf and then another.\nDOCTOR: Very, very subtle. I heard you!\nDOCTOR: Suddenly many of the books start flying off the shelf.\nVOICE: (Whispers loud and harsh) Consider this your final warning!\nVOICE: Suddenly the room starts to trash itself. Books are thrown across the floor, glass is smashed. There is a wind flying through the room,\nVOICE: atria everything, including the DOCTOR, who struggles to stand inst it.\nDOCTOR: I... will... not... kill... him!\nVOICE: . (Loud harsh whisper) You break off the deal, Time Lord, and you die! All who hear my voice will die!\nVOICE: 216\nVOICE: The VOICE keeps repeating the word ‘die’. As the room continues to tear itself apart, we hear a loud scream echo throughout the house. It is JADE. The room being smashed and JADE’s scream merge into... Music: Doctor Who theme tune -— the repeated word ‘die' continues over the top of the theme tune, getting louder and louder and as the theme ends the whispering VOICE laughs."

I will...\nJADE: She runs out of the room sobbing, the door shutting behind her.\nJADE: 218\nVICTOR: Jacqueline! What in the name of all that is holy has got into you?\nJACQUELINE: (Stunned) 1... I don’t know. Did I just hit Jade?\nVICTOR: Yes!\nJACQUELINE: Well, she is nought but a servant anyw — what?! What am I saying?”\nVICTOR: I do not know!\nJACQUELINE: (Panicking) You see, Victor! There is something happening! It’s like earlier when you shouted at John! It wasn’t like you!\nVICTOR: Well, that certainly wasn’t like you! It is like I say — it’s this house. We have to tell John that if...\nJOHN: enters.\nJOHN: Cinterrupts) Tell me what?\nVICTOR: There is—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) It is nothing, John. How is the stranger?”\nJOHN: He is quite an extraordinary man! We have so much in\nJOHN: common. He is almost as intelligent as I! (Laughs but notices nobody else does) Yes... well..., he is going to stay for the evening.\nJACQUELINE: Are we to return to the study?\nJOHN: Well, if that is what you want.\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts) Good! We were running out of wine, anyway. Come along, Jacqueline, John—\nVICTOR: He is interrupted by JADE’s scream as heard at the end of Part Two. JACQUELINE, gasping, drops the plate which smashes to the floor. They Jeave the room.\nVICTOR: NB: No Scene 19.\nVICTOR: SCENE 20: INT. THE CORRIDOR. This scene continues directly on from Scene Eighteen.\nJOHN: dade! Jade! What is it? What's the —\nJOHN: They stop running. JOHN gasps.\nVICTOR: Jacqueline, don’t look.\nJACQUELINE: No! No! It can't be...\nJADE: (Crying) My cat...\nJOHN: Look at me Jade. Look at me.\nJADE: (Crying) My cat!\nJOHN: Look into my eyes, Jade. 1 am your Master and you will-\nJOHN: (Hypnotic but not threatening) Jade! Listen to my voice. I want you to go to the scullery. Forget what you have seen here. Go to the scullery and fetch my new guest a light meal. Some cold meats or somesuch. Will you do that?\nJADE: (Crying) I...\nJOHN: (Hypnotic) Can you do that for me?\nJADE: (Crying) Ye... yes, sir.”\nJOHN: Jacqueline?\nJACQUELINE: (Shocked) I'll go with her. JACQUELINE and JADE leave.\nVICTOR: Is this some kind of joke? If so, it’s in poor taste!\nJOHN: Victor, L..\nVICTOR: It's taunting me, John. It’s taunting us.\nVICTOR: 219\nJOHN: It? Victor! I don’t know what's happening here but...\nVICTOR: Look. Its throat has been cut, it’s been sliced open and I’d wager a hundred Imperials that its heart has been removed.\nJOHN: I know. I was never particularly fond of the creature but Jade liked it.\nVICTOR: Where is the stranger?\nJOHN: Sutton? In the study, as far as I know.\nVICTOR: Well, perhaps we should go and speak to him!\nJOHN: Yes... let’s cover this... mess, first.\nJOHN: He pulls down a curtain as he speaks.\nJOHN: This curtain will do for now until-\nVICTOR: interrupts with a frightened laugh.\nJOHN: What?\nVICTOR: Look! It’s green! You’re covering it in a green shroud!”\nJOHN: Come on, Victor, snap out of it. Let’s go and-\nJOHN: The door to the study (further down the corridor) is suddenly flung open and the DOCTOR, shouting, flies out, collapsing against the wall. We hear the chaos in the study as the door is open but it slams shut immediately behind the DOCTOR.\nVICTOR: What the—\nDOCTOR: (Delirious) John! I don’t... I don’t think your house likes me!\nDOCTOR: JOHN and VICTOR run down towards the DOCTOR.\nJOHN: What happened?\nDOCTOR: (Still slightly confused) It’s been a long time since I was\nDOCTOR: attacked by a book.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: INT. THE STUDY.\nDOCTOR: The chaos has stopped, leaving just the clock ticking and the storm outside. As they open the door and walk in, we hear them standing on Paper and broken glass.\nVICTOR: What the... What has happened in here?\nJOHN: Quickly, close the doors. (Doors close) Keep the ladies out for now. (Beat) Doctor Sutton! Are you all right? Can you hear me?\nDOCTOR: ‘And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome.’\nVICTOR: Dear God, the man’s—\nJOHN: (interrupts) Quoting Stevenson...\nDOCTOR: (Coughing) John... what happened?\nVICTOR: We were rather hoping you could tell us!\nJOHN: Victor! Please, remain calm!\nVICTOR: But look at the mess he’s made of your study!\nJOHN: Lhardly think our friend here did all this. Do you? You’re\nJOHN: an Adjudicator! Could one man do this in such a short space of time? You heard his voice! Come on, Victor! Look at the facts! Face up to what might be happening here!\nVICTOR: What?\nJOHN: Oh never mind. Fetch the Doctor a brandy. That's if the decanter is still in one piece.\nVICTOR: walks over to the decanter and pours two glasses of brandy.\nVICTOR: I think I'll have one myself.\nVICTOR: 220\nVICTOR: He walks back and hands JOHN the other.\nJOHN: Thank you. Here, Doctor Sutton, drink this.\nDOCTOR: (Drinking) Thank you. (Slight laugh) Déja vul\nJOHN: Indeed. Except, an hour ago my study did not look as ifa storm had raged through it. (Quietly) What happened?\nDOCTOR: I was attacked... didn’t want to have to tell you...\nJOHN: Tell me what!\nDOCTOR: IL... I know who-\nDOCTOR: He is interrupted by the doors opening as JACQUELINE arrives.\nJACQUELINE: I’ve got some food — (Gasps) What has happened? John! Your books!”*\nJOHN: I know. Put the tray down, Jacqueline. Victor, I think your wife would also appreciate a brandy...\nVICTOR: What? Yes... yes, of course. Sit down, Jacqueline.\nJOHN: walks over and pours another brandy as JACQUELINE sits down.\nVICTOR: gives her the brandy and also sits down.\nJACQUELINE: (Sipping the drink) What is happening here?\nJOHN: I think I owe you both an explanation. I haven’t been entirely honest with you. Jacqueline, Victor. You two are my closest friends but the reason J invited you here tonight wasn’t just because of my birthday...\nJOHN: Fade down.\nJOHN: SCENE 22: INT. THE STUDY. Fade up. The clock is ticking and the storm is sounding outside.\nJOHN: ...SOQ you see why I need your help.\nVICTOR: (Jumping up, shouts) You brought us here to participate in some ridiculous ghost hunt?\nJOHN: (Standing up, quiet) Please, Victor. Please, stay calm. Do\nJOHN: you not understand? I needed you two. Especially you, with your insistence on facts and certainty, I needed someone who would not be so easily affected as Jacqueline or Ii\nVICTOR: (Shouts) You have placed my wife’s life at risk!\nJACQUELINE: Victor! Don’t be so ridiculous. John, needs our - ”\nVICTOR: Cinterrupts, shouts) There you go again, you see! Why\nVICTOR: must you always take his side? You, in case you have forgotten, are my wife! Not his!\nVICTOR: JACQUELINE And you, in case you have forgotten, are supposed to be an Adjudicator! What has happened to you? (Pause) You are also supposed to be John’s friend!”\nVICTOR: (Shouts) Do friends keep secrets from each other?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Sometimes...\nVICTOR: (Shouts) And who the hell are you?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Why are you so scared, Inspector Schaeffer? 1 thought you didn’t believe in the supernatural?\nVICTOR: I don’t! Well... Something is happening here!”\nVICTOR: JOHN At last, Victor, you are starting to open your mind!\nDOCTOR: There is nothing worse than a closed one.\nJOHN: Indeed. Now please, Victor, sit down.\nVICTOR: sits down.\nJOHN: I may be stating the obvious here, but something is\nJOHN: 221\nJOHN: happening tonight. The curse, the murders, my memory loss... they are all connected.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I think they are.\nJOHN: What?\nDOCTOR: What is happening here is more than a vengeful ghost. Much more.\nJOHN: I am beginning to suspect that myself.\nVICTOR: John, we should leave this house. Immediately.\nJOHN: But we cannot leave. The storm outside is just as\nJOHN: dangerous as what is happening inside. A roll of thunder as if on cue.\nVICTOR: So what do you propose we do?”\nJACQUELINE: May I make a suggestion?\nJOHN: By all means.\nJACQUELINE: We are not children. We are intelligent, well-bred adults. Why do we not discuss this, like adults? You said that there is a connection between the old curse and the murders. What is that connection?\nJOHN: Well... the legend concerns an ancestor of yours, and also bears remarkable similarities to the murders Victor is investigating.\nVICTOR: How?\nVICTOR: JOHN The latest murder was of a girl mistaken for a prostitute.\nVICTOR: Just as Joseph Utterson mistook the girl who died for a prostitute, all those years ago...\nJACQUELINE: So you are saying that we are the connection! But how? How could that old curse be anything to do with this situation?\nDOCTOR: I might be able to help there. Firstly, I think we can all rule out the possibility of the curse being genuine. None of us here truly believe in it, do we?**\nDOCTOR: There is a pause.\nDOCTOR: Do we?\nJACQUELINE: Well... something is happening.\nDOCTOR: This legend about a curse. It’s an old family story is it,\nDOCTOR: Jacqueline? Passed down from generation to generation?\nJACQUELINE: (Laughs) Oh, no, Doctor. Victor, can you imagine my mother telling me such a tale?\nVICTOR: (Laughs) Hardly.\nJACQUELINE: Doctor, my family is very proud. They would rather incidents such as what led to the curse were quietly forgotten. Erased from history.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. My family feel the same way about me. So who told you the curse?**\nJACQUELINE: 01d Woolstencroft. The man who used to own this house.\nJOHN: I didn’t think you had ever met him?\nJACQUELINE: Only the once. He called into the Hostel one day. DOCTOR And told you the story.\nJACQUELINE: JOHN And he decorated this house, the house he gave to me, in\nJACQUELINE: black and green... green - I think I might be seeing what you are getting at, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: There are too many coincidences happening tonight.\nJOHN: Including your arrival.\nDOCTOR: Himm. Yes.\nDOCTOR: 222\nJOHN: Looking for a missing friend. Isn’t that right?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Pause.\nDOCTOR: JOHN And would I be that missing friend?\nDOCTOR: JACQUELINE and VICTOR gasp.\nDOCTOR: What? No, of course not.\nJOHN: Come along, Doctor. Don’t mistake my physical disability\nJOHN: for a mental one. I am not a fool. It’s as you said — there are too many coincidences happening here tonight.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And I am not one of them. Trust me, John.\nVICTOR: Trust you? We don’t even know who you are!\nVICTOR: DOCTOR And do you know who you are? Well, do you? I mean John tells me you have been behaving oddly. Acting out of character, so to speak.\nVICTOR: Iam under a, lot of pressure. The murders —\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. The murders. How goes the investigation, Inspector?\nVICTOR: We are making some progress.\nDOCTOR: Really? According to John, you are no nearer in discovering the killer than you were after the first. murder.\nVICTOR: There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the killings. No motive!\nVICTOR: pOocToR No rhyme or reason? I can think of a hundred motives!\nVICTOR: Young pretty women: jealousy! Prostitutes: a deep loathing for the guilty, for the dirty, for the criminal! Hearts removed: because they never deserved them! A green shroud: a return to nature? Where else should Nature’s abhorrence be sent? A hundred diff—\nJOHN: (interrupts) Doctor!\nJACQUELINE: This is getting us nowhere. May I make another suggestion?\nJOHN: What's that?\nJACQUELINE: [If the storm continues, we will all have to spend the night here. Well, I have two things to say about that. Firstly, whatever is happening here is causing us all to attack each other. It is causing us all to act, as the Doctor said, out of character. Well, are we going to let it win?\nVICTOR: It?\nJACQUELINE: Whatever it is. Are we going to let it destroy our friendship? Surely, we should try and remain calm.\nJACQUELINE: DOCTOR And your second suggestion?\nJACQUELINE: This room is a mess. I do not know about anyone else, but I have no wish to go to bed tonight.\nJACQUELINE: VICTOR In this house? Not bloody likely.\nJACQUELINE: So let’s tidy up. Let’s do something constructive, instead of sitting here allowing ourselves to be manipulated into accusing each other of-\nVICTOR: CInterrupts) But what about the cat? Someone in this room killed the cat!\nJOHN: I think Jacqueline is right-\nVICTOR: CUnterrupts) Don’t you want to talk about the cat John? You were in the corridor just before we found it. Perhaps—\nJOHN: Cinterrupts, quietly angry, getting louder) Victor! I do not\nJOHN: wish to talk about it because I do not welcome death into this house! We can all cast aspersions on each other. Yes, I was in the corridor but... who did it\nJOHN: 223\nJOHN: affect most? If I remember correctly, your words were ‘It’s taunting me’ and ‘It’s a warning’. What is ‘it’? Why you? Why would the ghost or whatever did it be taunting you? Warning you? Have you something to hide?®\nVICTOR: (Jumps up) John! How dare- * ‘ ;\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupts) Jacqueline is right! You’re allowing it to control you! :\nJOHN: (Quieter) Then let’s tidy this mess. How can we think\nJOHN: straight when surrounded by such clutter? Jacqueline, if you would help me with the books. Doctor, Victor perhaps you would be so good as to rearrange those cabinets there.\nJOHN: DOCTOR Of course. Come along Inspector.\nJOHN: The DOCTOR and VICTOR move to the other side of the room. JACQUELINE and JOHN start putting the books back on the shelves. They talk in lowered voices.\nJACQUELINE: Should they be in any particular order?\nJOHN: It doesn’t matter. Can I ask you something? JACQUELINE Of course, John.\nJOHN: Do you think I am foolish for allowing Doctor Sutton to stay?\nJACQUELINE: I’m sure you have your reasons.\nJOHN: He knows me, Jacqueline. He knows me from my time\nJOHN: before Perfugium. Why won’t he tell me?\nJACQUELINE: You think he did you harm?\nJOHN: Actually, I think the opposite. I am starting to suspect something. Something I have been trying to ignore for months now.\nJACQUELINE: What is it?\nJOHN: When we came into the room, the Doctor quoted something from Jekyll and Hyde.\nJACQUELINE: What's that?\nJACQUELINE: JOHN A book, from your ancestors’ time. About a killer with two personalities — the evil Hyde and the good Dr Jekyll.\nJACQUELINE: So?\nJOHN: It was a commert by Hyde about how he welcomed the reflection of his ugly visage.\nJACQUELINE: And?\nJOHN: I had made such a comment earlier in the evening. I said to him how I welcomed my reflection, disturbing though it is, because it was the only reminder of what once I might have been.\nJACQUELINE: I still do not understand.\nJOHN: Suppose... suppose I was Hyde.\nJOHN: They stop replacing the books.\nJACQUELINE: What?\nJOHN: Suppose I was Hyde and now I am Jekyll.\nJACQUELINE: You think you were some evil killer? That’s ridiculous. You couldn't harm an insect, John.\nJOHN: Exactly! Doctor John Smith could not harm an insect. ‘Man is not truly one, but truly two. The good, honest, life-saving Doctor Jekyll and the evil, murdering Hyde.\nJACQUELINE: He is doing something to you! You’ve never considered that before. Think about your books, John! Motives, reasons,\nJACQUELINE: psychoanalysis... You say it yourself constantly — we are coinplex beings! I will not believe it of you.\nJACQUELINE: 224\nJOHN: He’s scared, Jacqueline. He’s scared of me. He's absolutely terrified that I might discover the truth. What was I? What was I?\nJACQUELINE: Perhaps then, it is better you do not know. Your life here—\nJOHN: Cinterrupts) The murders! I have to know.\nJACQUELINE: (Shocked) You think it might be you?\nJOHN: (interrupts) Too many coincidences remember! It’s as if...\nJOHN: iVs as if there is something inside of me, strugéling to break free. I have to know what it is! Jacqueline, I have to know what I am!*”\nJOHN: He picks up something.\nJACQUELINE: What's that?\nJOHN: It’s a knife. A dinner knife...\nVOICE: (Whispers almost subliminally) Gonna cut your throat. VICTOR and the DOCTOR are moving some furniture. They also talk in hushed tones.\nDOCTOR: (Struggling) And... there.\nDOCTOR: We hear them right a piece of furniture and then place objects back on\nDOCTOR: So, tell me Inspector. Do you trust John?\nDOCTOR: VICTOR Of course I do. We have been friends for many years. We have—\nDOCTOR: CInterrupts hissing) Listen to me. You have to get out of here.\nVICTOR: What?\nDOCTOR: Something is happening tonight. Something evil.\nDOCTOR: Something without motive or reason. You and your wife could be ~ no, you are in terrible danger.\nVICTOR: Doctor, I do not like staying here any more than you do but the storm—\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupts) Against the natural elements, you stand a\nDOCTOR: chance. Against the unnatural? You will certainly die. The whispering voice sniggers.\nVICTOR: Like the cat?\nVICTOR: DOCTOR The cat. It wasn’t a warning. It was trying to provoke a response. Trying to make someone react.\nVICTOR: Do you think it could be connected to the murders?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps...\nVICTOR: How? You think it was John?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Do you?\nVICTOR: He is a man of mystery, Doctor. Who knows what motives he might have?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think I know the motives behind the murders.\nVICTOR: (Uncomfortable) Do you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. But, loath though I am to say it, they are not important right now.\nVICTOR: I had to—\nVICTOR: He is interrupted by a scuffle on the other side of the room and JACQUELINE's scream.\nVICTOR: What the—\nDOCTOR: CUinterrupts, quietly) Oh, no. It’s too late,\nJOHN: (Holding a struggling JACQUELINE with a knife to her\nJOHN: throat) It’s time for some answers, Doctor!\nJOHN: 225\nVICTOR: Jacqueline!\nJOHN: Stay where you are, Victor, or I will cut her throat open!\nJACQUELINE: (Panicking) He’s gone mad! Please, do as he says!\nDOCTOR: So? The Master makes his appearance.\nDOCTOR: JOHN The Master?\nDOCTOR: Or is some of you still John Smith?\nJOHN: I do not know of who you speak. Stop struggling, woman!\nJOHN: Doctor! There is something happening to me! I can feel it breaking free... T can feel it in my mind... in my soul! Tell me what I am!\nDOCTOR: Let Jacqueline go. She has done nothing.\nDOCTOR: JOHN And have you lie to me again? Never. You will tell me what I am or the streets of Perfugium will run with the blood of innocents!\nDOCTOR: I can’t! If you find out what you were, then you will remember! And if you remember, then we’ll all die!\nJOHN: You will die anyway! I can feel him... yes... I can feel\nJOHN: this... Master taking dominance once again! Tell me what he is before it’s too late!\nDOCTOR: You're holding your friend at knife-point! It’s already too late.\nJOHN: (Shrieks) TELL MB!\nJACQUELINE: screams and then there is a pause.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) No.\nDOCTOR: There is a pause.\nVICTOR: (Shouts) Tell him! Doctor!\nJACQUELINE: (Terrified) Please!\nDOCTOR: (Calm) Go on, then John. Kill her,\nJOHN: (Shrieks) Tell me who I am!\nDOCTOR: Would anyone like a brandy?\nVICTOR: knocks the brandy decanter to the floor and strangles the\nDOCTOR: as he shouts...\nVICTOR: I don’t want another bloody brandy! Tell him, Doctor! Tl... kill... you, if you don’t tell him!\nDOCTOR: (Can hardly breathe) John...\nDOCTOR: There is a pause.\nJOHN: (Quietly) Let go of him, Victor!\nVICTOR: (Shouts) Let go of Jacqueline first!\nJACQUELINE: (Suddenly) I'm sorry, John. Look, Victor. I am fine.\nVICTOR: jumps up, runs over to JACQUELINE and hugs her.\nVICTOR: ores Oh, thank God. I couldn’t bear to lose you! (Pause) But... what...?\nDOCTOR: (Standing up) It was a trick, Inspector. Wasn’t it? John? Jacqueline?\nJOHN: Tam sorry.\nJOHN: He drops the knife.\nVICTOR: (Stunned) Jacqueline...\nJACQUELINE: John needs to know who he is, Victor. We agreed that if he pretended to... well, threaten me, then perhaps the Doctor would tell\nVICTOR: ‘You put me through that?\nJACQUELINE: I'm sorry, Victor. Truly, I am but—\nVICTOR: (interrupts) You put me through that, for him?\nVICTOR: 226\nJOHN: We are sorry Victor...\nVICTOR: (Interrupts) You shut the hell up! (To JACQUELINE) Do you know what I do for you, woman? Do you know what lengths I go to protect you from harm? Do you? (Violently shakes JACQUELINE) Well, do you?\nJACQUELINE: (Scared) I’m sorry, Victor!\nVICTOR: How could you... how could you do... (He breaks down)\nJACQUELINE: (Comforting VICTOR) Ssh. I’m sorry. Ssh, now.”\nDOCTOR: Happy, Doctor Smith?\nJOHN: How can I be happy? How can I be anything? I have to\nJOHN: know what I was. Tell me, Doctor. Did I... did I kill someone? Are you scared that I'll kill again? Am I killing already?\nJOHN: DOocTOR I didn’t want... (To himself) Oh, she’s done a good job. Manipulated the whole situation — the curse, the murders even... all for tonight. All to make me helpless.\nJOHN: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: (Quietly) Sit down. Sit down and I will tell you what once you were.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 23: INT. THE APARTMENT. Fade up. The muted crowds and cars, etc.\nMAN: Yes, who was he then? Come on...\nDOCTOR: (Sad and quiet without any anger in his voice) And so the stranger spoke. He told him of two young boys, growing up together in a land far far away from Perfugium. Two boys, so alike that many considered them more as brothers than as friends. Their world was one of rules — a stuffy, class-driven society. And as Jacqueline Schaeffer had striven to escape her social chains so they strove to shatter their own.” Two young children laughing as the DOCTOR speaks.\nDOCTOR: They would run away from their classes, run free through fields and forests. Often, as they tired of running, they would sit by the river and stare up at the stars. They would talk of how one day they would be truly free, and how they would wander the stars and see the universe. They were united in their yearnings to escape and be free. They were, however, also united in their suffering at the hands of another. The laughing stops.\nDOCTOR: Another boy would torment and bully them for he saw them as simply ants. One day the ants revolted. They had been playing on the banks of the River Lethe when Torvic - for that was the bully’s name — appeared.\nDOCTOR: A child laughing mockingly.\nDOCTOR: He wasn't evil. He was just another naughty young child, trying to break the rules. He found the two boys sat by the river. Without warning, he jumped. Pulled one of them down to the water, grabbed his head and pushed it into the flowing stream.*!\nDOCTOR: The mocking child’s laugh now as if heard from underwater. Someone struggling to breathe in water.\nDOCTOR: (Still calm and sad) The child struggled. Struggled vainly as the water went up his nose and down his throat. Torvic wasn’t going to drown him. He was merely... well, he was merely doing what bullies do. Seeking control.”\nDOCTOR: 227\nDOCTOR: Fade down the laughing and underwater SFX.\nMAN: (Quiet, shocked) But... but what about the other boy? What did he do? :\nDOCTOR: This is where it all began. Usually when Torvic tormented\nDOCTOR: one of them, the other would sit and wait. Helpless. But this time... this time something awoke in the other child.\nDOCTOR: A child screaming in rage fades up from silence. This mixes with the other child’s spiteful laughter.\nDOCTOR: This is where it all began. The other boy felt the anger, the rage, the bloodlust rise up in him. A blind fury, an anger... sick with anger... he charged at Torvic... (pauses then quieter) stopping only to pick up a large stone on the way...”\nDOCTOR: ‘A stone crunching into a skull suddenly interrupts the scream and the Jaughter. A pause then a splash as a body hits the water.\nDOCTOR: (Almost whispering) Torvic never stood a chance. The murderer pulled his friend from the water and they stood there in silence. Watched as the blood flowed from Torvice’s shattered skull. Watched as the blood flowed into the stream. Watched, unable to comprehend what one of them had done. The other boy, being of a sounder mind, realised immediately what punishment they would face.\nMAN: But... but they had only been trying to protect themselves!\nDOCTOR: (Sadly remembering) One of them had taken a life! They\nDOCTOR: knew that if they were caught, they would never realise their hopes for freedom. They would never see the universe.\nMAN: What did they do?\nDOCTOR: They pulled Torvie’s corpse from the river. They pulled him onto dry land. They covered his body in branches from the trees. Then, together, as one, they set the funeral pyre alight.™\nDOCTOR: A fire burning.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And together, holding hands, they watched as his body burnt. They watched as Torvic’s skin bubbled and burnt and became smoke. They watched as they sent him back to Nature.\nDOCTOR: Fade down the fire.\nDOCTOR: MAN And they were never caught?\nDOCTOR: They were never caught. They returned to their homes as if nothing had happened. And, as the years went by, the boys grew up and apart. They never once spoke again of that dreadful day. Years later, one of them left their home, for reasons too complicated to go into. And he became known as the Doctor. He travelled the universe, always with friends, doing good wherever he could. Perhaps... perhaps to, in some small way, try and make up for what he had done that day. The other, the one who had smashed Torvic’s head into a bloody pulp, became distant as the guilt and hatred ate away at him. Gnawing at his soul. He too left their home. He too travelled the universe, but always alone, doing... doing whatever he could to survive. But... but, something was growing inside of him... evil. Wherever he travelled, so he brought death. He had no motives, no reasons... he was the Master.””\nMAN: (Quiet) And that’s who John Smith is?\nMAN: DOCTOR And the stranger told them of the Master. He told them of his ridiculous schemes and plans. His plans to control the universe. He had no motive. There was no reason! There was only one certainty with\nMAN: 228\nMAN: the Master and that was that he would bring Death. He was, beyond all doubt, evil! He told them of worlds destroyed and families devastated. He told them of how the Master would kill and kill and kill, of how thousands... no, millions had died at his hands. His once accomplice, his oldest friend, the Doctor, became his oldest foe.\nMAN: (Quiet) And Doctor Sutton was this Doctor?\nDOCTOR: He was!\nDOCTOR: SCENE 24: INT. THE STUDY. Fade up. SFX: The clock ticking and the wind outside.\nJOHN: (Quietly) Well...\nJACQUELINE: That’s an awful... tragic story...\nVICTOR: Stuff and nonsense!\nJACQUELINE: (Quietly) Victor! Be quiet! John? John, how are you\nJOHN: So it’s all true?\nDOCTOR: I am so sorry.\nJOHN: (Calmly) I am evil. I am fated to kill. Perhaps... perhaps\nJOHN: I was trying to make the universe see the same colour red as IT do?”\nJACQUELINE: No! No, it’s not true!\nDOCTOR: It is, 'm afraid.\nJOHN: (Clears his throat) You should leave. Jacqueline, Victor — you both should leave.\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) John! We are your friends. I am your friend! I will not leave you. Not like...\nDOCTOR: Like I did?\nJACQUELINE: But the curse? The murders? The ghost? Are you expecting us to believe that John is responsible for all this? How could he? How could he cause us to act so oddly earlier?”\nDOCTOR: Because my — our — race have certain telepathic abilities. I believe that as John’s real- *\nJOHN: Cinterrupts) As my Hyde tried to escape this Jekyll shell,\nJOHN: so your true beliefs tried to escape. Jacqueline, you are a good woman and a wonderful person but you are not perfect. You do so much good but deep down there are darker sides to your personality. You have prejudices that, try as you might, you cannot control. It is the same with you, Victor—\nVICTOR: CInterrupts) Do not even talk to me.\nJOHN: You try to believe in fairness and justice and facts but inside, buried deep you also have prejudices. You believe that all those who commit crime are lower, baser than the rest of us.\nVICTOR: Well I... ”\nJOHN: If I do have these telepathic abilities then, as this creature - the Master - inside of me is trying to break free, so your secret Masters inside of you were doing the same! I brought them out of you...\nJOHN: There is a pause.\nJACQUELINE: Well... I too have a confession.\nJOHN: What?\nJACQUELINE: When I was a little girl... I once... well, it was long ago and I do not like to speak of it but once (pause) I stole some humbugs from\nJACQUELINE: 100\nDOCTOR: CSadiy) I don’t think you understand-\nDOCTOR: 229\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts calmly) No, Doctor, I don’t think you understand.\nJACQUELINE: pocToR You don’t know what he was like!\nJACQUELINE: JACQUELINE And you don't know what he is like. You speak of Traken and Duchamp and of 4 thousand other places. I speak of Perfugium. You can name a hundred people that the Master killed. I can name a thousand that John Smith has saved. Doctor, I do not know what it is like where you are from but here, in Perfugium, our friendships cannot be so easily broken. John Smith is a good man. And as Hyde was separate from Jekyll so is John separate from the Master of which you speak. The man you see sat before you is a wonderful doctor. He grows tomatoes and makes his own wine. He enjoys the theatre and books and... and the company of his friends. He’s not fond of dogs or people with shifty eyes. He has failings and I wouldn’t claim that he was perfect but... but he’s a damn sight nearer to perfect than anyone else in this room. (To JOHN) John, tonight has been a night of surprises. Tomorrow was also to be one. For tomorrow there is to be a party in the Town Hall, in your honour. Many will attend for you have many friends. (Back to the DOCTOR) So you see, Doctor, whatever is happening tonight, whatever John has to face, he will not ~ he shall not ~ face it on his own.’\nJOHN: Thank you, Jacqueline.\nDOCTOR: But there is nothing we can do!\nJACQUELINE: Then, Doctor, I suggest you leave.\nDOCTOR: Fate is coming for him and it will not care who stands in its way.\nJACQUELINE: Fate will have to pass through me, then.\nJACQUELINE: VICTOR And you haven’t seen my wife when she’s angry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: dohn?\nJOHN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You have good friends. (Beat) And I have not been one of\nDOCTOR: them. But I think your friends are right and I am wrong, John. Free will is not an illusion! We can’t let fate decide our actions! Come on! Come with me, all of you. If we can get away from here then... well, there’s a chance. And, frankly, it's a chance worth taking.\nDOCTOR: A series of bangs sound throughout the house.\nVICTOR: What-—\nDOCTOR: Cinterrupis) Quickly! John! I failed you many years ago — I will not do it again!\nDOCTOR: The bangs get louder and then a scream from JADE echoes throughout the house.\nJOHN: T fear it might be too late!\nJACQUELINE: Wait! What about Jade! She’s still in the scullery...\nDOCTOR: (interrupts) Who?\nJOHN: Jade, my maid!\nDOCTOR: Your what? (Quiet) Oh no. John, I fear Jade is much more than your maid!\nJOHN: Well, yes, She’s also cook and hous: er.\nDOCTOR: No, she is much more than that. es com The house begins to sound as if it is shaking itself to Pieces.\nVICTOR: We have to get out of here!\nJOHN: I can’t move. Something... forcing me...\nJACQUELINE: (Defiant) Whatever’s happening, we stay with John. We—\nJACQUELINE: 230\nVICTOR: Jacqueline!\nVICTOR: Suddenly all the noise stops leaving just the clock ticking.\nJACQUELINE: Silence.\nDOCTOR: Except for the clock.\nDOCTOR: The clock stops ticking. For a second there is silence and then the door begins to creak open.\nJOHN: da... Jade?\nJADE: (Eerily, innocent) Hello sir.\nJOHN: dade — what... what is it?\nJADE: (Herily, Innocent) Please, sir. Now the masks have\nJADE: dropped, can we address each other by our proper names? We are no longer John Smith and Jade, his servant. You are my servant, the Master!\nJOHN: But... then who are you?\nJADE: (Eerily, innocent) Me Sir? Oh, I'm Death!\nJADE: The door slams shut behind her.\nJADE: 231"

The stakes are high then?’\nDOCTOR: You could say that.\nMAN: (Dramatically) And then with a crash of thunder and a flash of light, Death destroyed our helpless heroes!\nDOCTOR: (Laughs) No... it wasn’t that simple.\nMAN: Somehow I didn’t think it would be. So... all the noise in\nMAN: the house had stopped...\nMAN: SCENE 26: INT. THE STUDY.\nMAN: The reprise starts from the clock ceasing its ticking. JADE walks further into the room as she talks. NB: no longer is JADE speaking ‘Edwardian’ as everyone else does. As a contrast, DEATH is very modern and colloquial.\nJADE: You know what? That entrance was even more dramatic than I had hoped it would be. I do so enjoy a stunned silence. So much more suitable than:\nJADE: JADE/VICTOR (This is JADE talking — but we hear both her and VICTOR's voices) John, old devil! Your lovely bit of stuff seems to have lost the plot!\nJADE: JADE And you Mrs Schaeffer? No:\nJADE: JADE/JACQUELINE Why, you insolent girl! I should put you over my knees!\nJADE: JADE And you Doctor! I had at least expected some incoherent: JADE/DOCTOR (Babbling) But, of course! I should have known — your name is Jade and green is the colour of Death and there is too much death and if only we could all just appreciate the beauty of a daisy and perhaps I should play my spoons!\nJADE: (Sadly) Except you don't do that any more, do you Doctor? Don't play your spoons. Don’t mix your metaphors. Don’t have fun! Too busy destroying planets, tidying up your previous mistakes, dreary navel-gazing...\nJOHN: (Calmly) Jade. I don’t know who you are -\nJADE: Cinterrupts matter-of-factly) I’m Death.\nJOHN: (Calmly) — or what you want but... leave these other three. It’s patently obvious that it’s me you have a quarrel with.\nJADE: Oh, he’s so brave, isn’t he, Jacqueline? I can see why you-\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) That's Mrs Schaeffer to you — Cher voice is cut off as she starts wheezing as an invisible force strangles her)\nVICTOR: Jacqueline!\nVICTOR: 232\nJADE: Does she ever shut up?'™\nVICTOR: Please! Whatever you're doing to her. Stop it!'!®\nJADE: Say please.\nDOCTOR: Pleass.\nJADE: Why? You've all had your own moments of glory. Forgot\nJADE: about poor old Jade, down in the scullery, didn’t you? J mean, I really think it’s my turn now.\nDOCTOR: Please.\nJADE: Oh, all right. Since you asked so nicely. There.\nJACQUELINE: starts breathing again.\nJOHN: Jacqueline!\nJACQUELINE: (Close to tears) I’m...\nJOHN: Ssh. Everything will be fine.\nJACQUELINE: (Quietly) I won’t cry! Won't give her that satisfaction.\nJADE: ‘You’re very quiet, Doctor.\nJOHN: I don’t really know -\nJADE: CInterrupts) Not you! The real Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Let them go.\nJOHN: Doctor, I appreciate you trying but surely this is between dade and myself?\nJADE: (Giggles) Oh, Doctor! You little minx! Didn't you tell them? Didn’t you tell John why you're here?'®\nDOCTOR: (Through gritted teeth) Don't do this!\nJADE: dohn! Your old friend, the Doctor here! He’s not here by\nJADE: coincidence! He’s here because he organised all this. You. Your life in Perfugium. He’s here because of his deal with me! He’s here... to kill you. Silence.\nJADE: But, at least you have your lifelong friends, the Inspector and Mrs Schaeffer, don’t you?\nJADE: Silence.\nJADE: Well? Don’t you?\nJOHN: I-\nDOCTOR: Cnterrupts hissing) Don’t do this!\nJADE: Oh. By the way, Victor is the one killing the prostitutes—\nJACQUELINE: (Shocked) Victor!\nJACQUELINE: JADE And Jacqueline is in love with you, John,\nJOHN: (Shocked) Jacqueline!\nVICTOR: No... no.... Jacqueline. J did it for you. All of it! And you\nVICTOR: repay me by loving him? Loving that!\nJACQUELINE: Victor. I...\nVICTOR: No! Damn you woman, no! (The last bit as he runs from the room)'””\nJADE: Oops! Did I let the cat out of the bag there, so to speak?\nJADE: A cat squeals, there is 2 sudden rush of noise — glass breaking, the door banging, a baby screaming, books falling, wind howling - during which the clock starts ticking, getting faster. It then starts chiming, getting faster, and then explodes. The noise stops. Silence for a few beats. Now it is pitch black. We hear JACQUELINE breathing and stumbling around.\nJACQUELINE: (Quietiy) Hello? (Pause) Hello? Is anyone there? John? Victor?\nVOICE: (Whispers) Alone. Alone in the dark.\nVOICE: 233\nJACQUELINE: (Panicking) Anyone? Is anybody here?\nJOHN: (Quietly breaking the silence) I am.\nJACQUELINE: John?\nJOHN: John? (Laughs) Who knows? Am I John or the Master?\nJOHN: Who knows anything any more?\nJACQUELINE: Where are you?\nJOHN: Over here. Follow my voice. (Pause) Or are you scared of me?\nJACQUELINE: (Scared laugh) I’m bloody terrified.\nJOHN: (Scared laugh) Me too. Never did like the darkness.\nJACQUELINE: crawls towards JOHN.\nJACQUELINE: What about the others?\nJOHN: Doctor? Jade? (Pause) Victor?\nJACQUELINE: He ran out... Do you think she was telling the truth?\nJOHN: You saw his reaction. What do you think?\nJACQUELINE: I can’t... I can’t believe it.’\nJOHN: It seems we all had secrets.\nJACQUELINE: Yes...\nJOHN: Was she telling the truth about you? Do you...\nJACQUELINE: 1... I always have.\nJOHN: But Victor?\nJACQUELINE: You know my mother.\nJOHN: Ah, She wanted you to marry handsome, upright\nJOHN: Inspector Schaeffer and not the disfigured man with no past.\nJACQUELINE: (Laughs sadly) Why would that be I wonder? I am so sorry, John, If only, I’d stood up to her.\nJOHN: She was correct, though. You were right not to... pursue me.\nJACQUELINE: How can you say that? I love you!\nJOHN: Jacqueline. You don’t know what I am- well, you do now. Tm evil\nJACQUELINE: No. No, you're not. You were once but this Doctor obviously has given you this new life here.\nJOHN: Yes, and now it seems he has come to take it away again.\nJACQUELINE: Well, we won’t let him. We should get out of here. Get away from Perfugium. Just the two of us. Nobody need know our pasts.\nJOHN: We can’t.\nJACQUELINE: We can!\nJOHN: Jacqueline! I am fated. Wherever we go, she will find us.\nJACQUELINE: She?\nJOHN: dade or Death or whatever she is. And what about Victor?\nJACQUELINE: I don’t want to think about Victor.\nJOHN: We can't run away, Jacqueline. We can’t pretend to be what we’re not. Inside of us we are fated. I am evil! Don’t you understand?\nJACQUELINE: No, John, you're- '\"”\nJOHN: Cinterrupts, suddenly bitter, hissing angrily) Don’t you understand? I am not human. I am not a doctor. I am not John Smith! I am the Master! I am evil and I am fated to kill and destroy and—\nJACQUELINE: (Interrupts) But John-\nJACQUELINE: 234\nJOHN: (Still angrily) My heart is black! My soul is tainted! If you stay near me, I will kill you! I can’t help it — it’s what I am inside!\nJACQUELINE: But... I love you, John.\nJOHN: (Calmer) Yes. Unfortunately, I do not feel the same way.\nJACQUELINE: What?\nJOHN: I don’t love you. I do not even like you that much.\nJACQUELINE: But I\"\nJOHN: (interrupts) You are foolish and unintelligent. Your pampered, aristocratic background has made you fat and prejudiced. You run that Hostel of yours to ease your guilt. Your subjects call you the Queen. of Hearts and you lap it up. Every last worshipping phrase they utter!\nJACQUELINE: (Close to tears) Why... why are you saying this?\nJOHN: Because it’s true. I pretended to be your friend to try to have some normality in my life. I grow tomatoes, I make wine, I have friends, et cetera, et cetera. In actuality, I am not normal. We know that now. Perhaps, we should all be a little bit more truthful. And in all honesty, you bore me. Now, you can either stay here in this house and die or you can leave but please just get away from me.\nJACQUELINE: John!\nJACQUELINE: She runs out of the room.\nJOHN: Alone. Alone in the darkness.\nDOCTOR: (Quietly breaking the silence) But the darkness cannot save you.\nDOCTOR: A cat squeals as the door slams shut. NB: No Scene 27.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: INT. THE HALLWAY.\nJACQUELINE: is running down the corridor. There is silence except for the wind outside.\nJACQUELINE: (Not quite crying) Oh... which way?...\nVOICE: (Whispering) This way. Follow my voice.\nJACQUELINE: (Stops running, voice is shaky) Wait! Breathe. Calm down, Jacqueline. You’re made of sterner stuff than this. Walk. Walk and breathe and stay — (She shrieks as she slips on something and falis to the floor) What? What’s that- oh God, the cat. The blood!\nJACQUELINE: Her heart is pounding.\nJACQUELINE: (Hising panic) The blood! Everything. Lies. Lies.\nJACQUELINE: The scratching again starts to sound.\nJACQUELINE: Stop it! I won’t let you scare me! I am not a child! I do not fear the dark or whatever it is you are!\nJACQUELINE: Some footsteps approaching.\nJACQUELINE: Who’s there? Victor?\nJACQUELINE: The scratehing, heartbeat and footsteps sound louder, threatening to overcome our Sé€nses.\nJADE: (Her voice seems to be moving about, coming from\nJADE: different directions) Hello, Jacqueline. Oh, I see you found my cat. Do you\nJADE: like it? I like the blood. Would you like me to put some on your face? Or\nJADE: perhaps in your eyes? You’ve been blind to Victor and John all these\nJADE: years. Perhaps we should really make you blind.\nJACQUELINE: Shut up! Where are you?\nJACQUELINE: 235\nJADE: (Suddenly close) I’m here. Time to open your eyes,\nJADE: Jacqueline.\nJACQUELINE: finaily screams. Then a beat of silence before: ;\nVOICE: (Whispers almost subliminally) You're going to die tonight.\nVOICE: SCENE 29: INT. THE STUDY. dust the (fainter) wind outside.\nDOCTOR: ‘You must really like her.\nJOHN: What? Where are you?\nDOCTOR: Over here. You tried to destroy her love for you to save her, didn’t you?\nJOHN: Well, aren’t you the great psychologist. So?\nDOCTOR: So?\nJOHN: Are you going to kill me?\nDOCTOR: I don’t want to.\nJOHN: That's very noble of you. But you're going to anyway?\nDOCTOR: We made a deal.\nJOHN: You and Death? Good friends are you?\nDOCTOR: Our paths cross from time to time. I wanted to save you.\nDOCTOR: Wanted to give you the life you never had. The life she took away from you. Do you remember when I said that I used to wonder what your motives were? I eventually realised that you had no motive. There was no reasoning behind your actions and that the only results of your actions were death. You were created by her, merely to destroy.\nJOHN: So why you? Why did you make the deal with my... my mistress?'””\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Guilt, perhaps? Because J had never tried to\nDOCTOR: understand you. She enjoys games. She came to me one night and made me an offer.\nJOHN: I don't need all the sordid details.\nDOCTOR: She said that she would relinquish her hold over you for ten years. For ten years you could live a life, at one with the universe instead of at odds with it.\nDOCTOR: JOHN And your side of the deal was to kill me?\nDOCTOR: poor” When the ten years were up, yes. But, I don’t want to. I can't!\nJOHN: Because of what you are? Life is that simple then. You are Sood and I am evil.\nDOCTOR: No. It’s not that simple at all but... I didn't expect you to be... didn’t expect you to have friends and be so... normal.'’*\nJOHN: Normal is something I can never be. Did she do all this then? Did she make Victor a murderer?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Like we said earlier, there are many coincidences.\nJOHN: As if... as if everything revolves around those of us in\nJOHN: this house. The killer could have been anyone in Perfugium but it was my oldest friend. Well, John Smith’s oldest friend. You’re apparently the Master's oldest friend, but then you are here to kill him. Me.\nDOCTOR: Death manipulated all this.\nJOHN: But why? Why is she doing this?\nJOHN: 236\nDOCTOR: It's a game. She sees us as merely ants. You, me, the others -— we're just playthings.\nJOHN: So, would it not be better for all of us if you just killed me? That would end the game.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes it would. By taking your life, I would be preventing the deaths of countless others.\nJOHN: Well, do it then. (Pause) Doctor, it’s dark. I can’t see you but I can sense you. You're standing over me, aren’t you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am.!\nDOCTOR: JOHN And presumably you’re holding the knife with which I threatened Jacqueline earlier, aren't you?\nDOCTOR: ‘Yes. Yes, I am.!\nJOHN: Well, use it then. End the game. Take my life. It’s dark.\nJOHN: ‘You needn't even see the whites of my eyes.\nJOHN: SCENE 30: INT. THE SCULLERY. The wind sounds outside. VICTOR is in the kitchen humming.\nVICTOR: ..in my head... in my head... sleeping...\nVICTOR: The door slams open as JACQUELINE runs in. She is in @ real state.\nJACQUELINE: Victor?\nVICTOR: (Dreamily) Hello, my darling.\nJACQUELINE: (Panic) What are you doing here?\nVICTOR: (Dreamily) Oh, just thinking. Time to myself.\nJACQUELINE: Victor... why?\nVICTOR: (Dreamily) Why what? Oh, the whores? I killed them to save you! I killed them to save all the innocents.\nVICTOR: SCENE 31: INT. THE STUDY. Still silence.\nJOHN: (Calmly) Well, Doctor? (Pause) Kill me. Make all this stop. pocToR But if I do that—\nJOHN: CInterrupts calmly) You'll be no better than me. But it\nJOHN: isn’t that simple. If I live, then surely I will kill once more. It’s fate. It’s what I am.\nDOCTOR: But that doesn't make it~\nJOHN: (interrupts calmly) Right? No. No, it doesn't. I have had a good life here. I’ve enjoyed being John Smith, citizen of Perfugium. And... and in all honesty, I don’t want to die but what other choice is there? Whai else can break Death’s hold over me?!’\nDOCTOR: But it isn’t your fault!\nJOHN: No. No, it isn’t. But... if I die, others will live. Jacqueline will live.\nDOCTOR: Do you... do you love her?\nJOHN: She makes me laugh. She makes me feel special. She gives\nJOHN: me hope. (Surprised) Yes. Yes, 1 think I do love her.''” The DOCTOR drops the knife.\nDOCTOR: Then her hope might be our hope!\nJOHN: How?\nDOCTOR: She loves you! You love her!\nDOCTOR: JOHN And what? You think love might be stronger than fate?\nDOCTOR: 237\nDOCTOR: As the Master you never once felt any emotion for anyone. My deal with Death was that you would live for ten years as a man who saved lives instead of taking them. As a man who could live in a community and feel as if he belonged.\nJOHN: Yes, so you said.\nDOCTOR: But, there was no mention of love! Don’t you understand? When you killed Torvic, the Jack of emotion, the inability to love... it grew inside of you and she used that! She encouraged it, nurtured it! That was her hold over you!\nJOHN: Lord! I think I do understand! It’s a common trait amongst serial killers and the like. They feel dissociated from others. As if they are constantly on the outside, looking in. But if I am capable of feeling love for another person...\nDOCTOR: Then you are capable of changing what you are! You can break free from your servitude. You can have free will! There can be hope!\nJOHN: Then we must move quickly, Doctor. We have to find Jacqueline.\nDOCTOR: Let me help you up.\nDOCTOR: The DOCTOR helps JOHN to his feet.\nJOHN: Thank you. Friend.\nDOCTOR: After all these years...\nDOCTOR: Fade down.\nDOCTOR: SCENE S52: INT. THE SCULLERY.\nDOCTOR: The wind outside. VICTOR is slowly stalking JACQUELINE around the kitchen as he speaks.\nVICTOR: Don't be scared, my sweet. I would never hurt you! Not after all these years of loving you.\nJACQUELINE: (Shakily but getting stronger) Keep away from me.\nVICTOR: But you're my wife. We love each other, don’t we?\nJACQUELINE: Why? Why did you kill them?\nVICTOR: Oh, I had to. I’m an Adjudicator. They were criminals. JACQUELINE The last one wasn’t.\nVICTOR: (Suddenly loud) I know! She was a mistake! I’m sorry!\nJACQUELINE: But why?\nVICTOR: They're filth. They deserve to die.\nVICTOR: JACQUELINE And their hearts? Why remove their hearts?\nVICTOR: Because... they don’t deserve hearts! They’re not like us!\nJACQUELINE: You... you said you did this for me?\nVICTOR: But, of course, my darling. Their blackness was tainting\nVICTOR: you. I know they came to see you at the Hostel.\nJACQUELINE: They needed help!\nVICTOR: You could not save them. They were beyond saving.\nJACQUELINE: Nobody's beyond saving, Victor!\nVICTOR: Not even me, Jacqueline?\nVICTOR: SCENE 35: INT. THE CORRIDOR.\nVICTOR: The wind outside. JOHN and the DOCTOR are walking slowly down the corridor,\nVICTOR: 238\nJOHN: There. Up ahead. A light. It’s coming from the scullery.\nDOCTOR: Jade. Or perhaps Jacqueline... Death might be tormenting her...\nJOHN: But why? It’s me Jade wants.\nDOCTOR: Ah, but if Jacqueline dies, your ability to love dies. And you will become the Master once more.\nJOHN: After how much I hurt her just now, I'm sure she cannot\nJOHN: love me, so what does it matter if I love her or not? How can she be at risk?\nDOCTOR: Please, John, listen to me. Try and see the bigger picture. If Jacqueline dies, millions more will follow like a set of dominoes!!!”\nDOCTOR: SCENE 34: INT. THE SCULLERY. The wind outside. Also random whispering voices throughout the scene, Jaughing, etc.\nJACQUELINE: Yes, Victor. There’s hope for you.\nVICTOR: (Starting to break down, quietly) I could never... I could never tell you what I was feeling. You were always so... superior to me. I worship you, Jacqueline.\nJACQUELINE: But why?\nJACQUELINE: She suddenly screams as VICTOR lunges at her and grabs hold of her.\nJACQUELINE: Victor! Please!\nVICTOR: (Whispering) Hold me! I won’t hurt you. I love you.\nJACQUELINE: (Talking for her life) And I... I care for you Victor. Tell me.\nVICTOR: Nobody ever cares. Nobody. But it’s there. In my head. Telling me!\nJACQUELINE: What? Telling you what?\nVICTOR: That everything is wrong. Everything is wrong but I can\nVICTOR: put it right! Don’t you understand?\nJACQUELINE: I'm... Victor, you're ill. You need help.'”\nVICTOR: No. No, no, no. I’m the Inspector. I help others. Do you love me?\nJACQUELINE: I... 1...\nVICTOR: She said you loved John! But you couldn’t could you?\nVICTOR: Look at him. He’s disgusting. Dogs bark at him in the street! You don't love him, you just feel sorry for him! And now we know! We know what he is inside. The Doctor told us!\nVICTOR: The DOCTOR and JOHN enter.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes! Well, you shouldn't believe everything I say.\nJOHN: Victor, My friend. Please.\nVICTOR: Oh! Now you want to talk to me, ‘old man’, eh? All these\nVICTOR: years! All these years of you keeping secrets. Corrupting my (turns to\nJACQUELINE: sweetly) my innocent Jacqueline. (Back to JOHN) Well, you shan’t have her! (Like a child) She’s mine!\nJACQUELINE: Victor! Please. John doesn't want me!\nDOCTOR: (Quiet warning) Inspector Schaeffer!\nVICTOR: Doctor! You knew John before! Was he evil?\nDOCTOR: He existed to kill, yes.\nVICTOR: So you can understand. You came here to destroy that\nVICTOR: which was evil! I was only doing the same. They were tainting our society. Tainting all that was good.\nVICTOR: 239\nDOCTOR: But that doesn’t give us the right to kill!\nVICTOR: So one rule for you and another for me?\nVOICE: (Whispers) Kill her!\nVICTOR: (Shouts) Get out of my head!\nJOHN: Victor. Please, let Jacqueline go. We can help you. Don’t let dade win.\nVICTOR: See I love her but I know she loves you. I’ve always known it.\nDOCTOR: Victor. Inspector Schaeffer. You want justice, yes?\nVICTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: You want peace.\nVICTOR: More than anything.\nDOCTOR: Then let her go. Jacqueline is the only thing that’s keeping Death from destroying Perfugium.\nVICTOR: She does care. Always looking after her criminals. Trying to help them.\nDOCTOR: More than that. She gives John hope. You give John hope.\nDOCTOR: You want peace in your mind, but the only way you'll get that peace is if you let her go.\nVICTOR: But... but I love her.\nJACQUELINE: Please, Victor. I do care for you. I want to help you.\nVICTOR: (Sadly) Always so superior aren’t you? You and John.\nVICTOR: Always wanting to look after me and help me. But I’m not the one who’s sick. He is! JACQUELINE And he has made his feelings for me quite clear.\nVICTOR: Tm sorry, Jacqueline. I do... I want you to be safe.\nJOHN: Victor, the Doctor can take us away from here. He can help us all.\nDOCTOR: Don't you understand, Inspector Schaeffer? Death has\nDOCTOR: been using you. While she couldn’t have John, she travelled the universe, snaring others in her trap. Making them act as her servants. You are not responsible, she is! None of us blame you.\nJOHN: You are innocent, my friend.\nDOCTOR: We're all innocent. We’ve all been pawns in her game. She's manipulated us into being here tonight. She created the curse. She twisted your mind. She ensured that here, on this night, all would become one. Why? So that there would be death. And when yours, Jacqueline’s and John’s friendship proved too strong she created a sense of evil and dread that stalks this house. Let Jacqueline go. Let’s escape the game.\nVICTOR: Jacqueline?\nJACQUELINE: Please Victor. Let’s be free.\nVICTOR: But... but... I don’t know!\nJACQUELINE: I! love you, Victor.\nVICTOR: (Sadly) No, you don't. You love him.\nJACQUELINE: You're... you're right. Can you ever forgive me?\nVICTOR: Can you ever love me?\nJACQUELINE: I do care for you.\nJACQUELINE: weron (Exeited, hopeful Then... you will stay with me? As my\nJACQUELINE: (Sadly) I can't, Victor. I’m truly sorry. But, I will always be your closest friend.\nVICTOR: (Sadly) Then, forgive me for what I must do.\nVICTOR: 240\nJACQUELINE: (Sadly) Please Victor. Please, do not do anything stupid. Don’t let Death win.\nVICTOR: If you can’t love me, I can’t let you love anyone else. Suddenly VICTOR snaps JACQUELINE’s neck.\nDOCTOR: (Shouts) Not'*\nVICTOR: lets JACQUELINE fall to the floor. JOHN screams in rage.\nVICTOR: Don’t scream! Why must everyone scream? Don’t you understand? I love her! I need her...\nVICTOR: His voice slows down and stops as does the wind. JOHN stops screaming and for a second there is silence. Then a flash of lightning sounds and\nJADE: appears.\nJADE: Poor Mrs Schaeffer. Who'd’ve thought it would be her husband who killed her?\nDOCTOR: Why? Why are you doing this?\nJADE: It’s what I do. It’s what he used to do. For me.\nJADE: DOCTOR On your behalf?\nJADE: Yes, exactly.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? Are you sure you didn’t work on his behalf? Do you know where the boundaries were? Or are?'”*\nJADE: Let’s ask him, shall we? Oh, John? John, are you in\nJADE: there? (Beat) Nope, nothing. Nadda. Zilch. Oh, but wait... ah ha! He’s just seen his lady friend die. Let’s try something else. (Beat) Oh Master? Master are you in there?!”\nJOHN: L.. L.. (Suddenly dark, suddenly the Master) Free.... free at last!\nDOCTOR: No! No, that’s not freedom, John! The Master is not freedom!\nJOHN: Oh but it is, Doctor. This is real. This is me. Not that snivelling, feckless ‘friend of the people’ nonsense you’ve put me\nJADE: See? I was right, you were wrong. Nyabh... '\nJOBN: Oh do be quiet, woman. Neither of you understand, do\nJOBN: you? I haven’t been lost, submerged, buried deep inside my... John’s subconscious. I’ve been here all the time, waiting for this moment. Waiting for the right moment to reappear, reassert myself.'””\nJADE: I think you’ll find, actually, that I —\nJOHN: You? You? What exactly did you do? Nothing except helped him imprison me for ten years. Ten long, tortured years, aware of my existence but unable to fulfil my destiny.\nDOCTOR: I rather fear, Death, or Jade or whatever you call yourself, that you are in error...\nJADE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: You couldn’t let him go, could you. You are both bound up\nDOCTOR: in one another and although we created the John persona for him, it wasn't enough. Wasn’t enough to eradicate the evil...\nJOHN: Evil? No Doctor, I refute your claim of evil. Evil implies malevolence, a desire only to destroy. I crave power, dominion, knowledge of the forbidden and the secret... so much more than just evil.\nDOCTOR: But don’t you see, those things lead to evil. They lead to death, death for innocents and innocence! That’s what I tried to... to take away...\nJOHN: Take away? You wanted me neutered! You had neither the\nJOHN: 241\nJOHN: courage nor the good sense to stop me forever, and instead you imprisoned me in Perfugium, imprisoned me in a lifestyle that is the antithesis of all I hold important. Of all that matters!\nJADE: Well, this is fun, but I think we need to bring this jolly reunion to a temporary halt.\nDOCTOR: John... Master... 1 warned you this would happen! That if\nDOCTOR: you let Jacqueline die, the Master would be free to corrupt and despoil and —\nJADE: Yes, thank you. That was the closing arguments from the prosecution? Now from the defence?\nJOHN: Let me be free! Let me exist as I truly am. The universe needs me and I need all that it has to offer!”\nJOHN: JADE And on that note...\nJOHN: Be silent, woman. I'm warning you..... (His voice is raised\nJOHN: to a screech that suddenly elongates and repeats over and over again like a stuck record)\nJADE: Well, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Happy now? Innocent lives destroyed and John is yours once more. We never stood a chance of making it through tonight, did we?\nJADE: ‘Yeah, well, the deal, if you remember, was for you to kill him. Of course, I knew you couldn’t do it so I had to use these others.\nDOCTOR: I'll make a new deal with you.\nJADE: Why?\nDOCTOR: I want him... John, not the Master, to have another\nDOCTOR: chance. To see what, as the John who has lived this life with these people\nDOCTOR: for ten years, will do when faced with options rather than givens.\nJADE: Deal.'?!\nJADE: DOCTOR And what do I have to do for you now?\nJADE: I'll let you know, Doctor. I’ll let you know. Now, where\nJADE: were we? Oh yes, Victor has murdered his missus in a fit of jealous rage\nJADE: ond dohn, who won’t remember our little téte 4 téte just then, isn’t too APY.\nJADE: Crash of thunder. VICTOR and JOHN’s yells and words start up again.\nJOHN: Victor! Victor, why?’\nVICTOR: L..

Think back. Think back to the day\nJADE: Torvic died. Think back to the deal you made with me then.\nDOCTOR: I... I can’t remember.\nJADE: That night, as you slept. That night when I came to you\nJADE: in your dreams.’**\nDOCTOR: What are you saying?\nDOCTOR: sADE This poor creature didn’t cause all this. He didn’t kill rvic.\nDOCTOR: 242\nDOCTOR: (im shock) No...\nJADE: You did.\nJADE: There is another flash of lightning and the rain starts to sound outside.\nJADE: Poor little Doctor. Poor little Master. Nasty little Torvic. He deserved to die, didn’t he?\nDOCTOR: (Devastated) No.\nJADE: Then why did you kill him?\nDOCTOR: (Devastated I... L.., didn’t...\nDOCTOR: A child sorrowfully moaning sounds with the same effect as when the\nDOCTOR: was telling his story in Part Three.\nJADE: You did. Oh, we don’t blame you. You were just trying to save your friend. It seems there’s a bit of me in everyone. The ability to take another’s life. But as long as there’s justification... You really don’t remember, do you? I could never make up my mind whether you did or didn’t. You killed Torvic, Doctor, and by rights you should have been mine. You should have been the Master and he should have been you. But... well, others had plans for you and so I had to make you an offer. (Pause) T came to you that night as you lay there dreaming childish thoughts. I came to you in those dreams and we made the deal. I let you make the choice. You or him. You could live with the guilt and the torment and let it eat away at you until you became mine forever or you could be free and give your closest friend to me. And can you remember what you said?\nCHILD: Take him.\nDOCTOR: (Devastated) It's not true.\nJADE: Oh, you know it is. You created the Master when you were\nJADE: merely a selfish child and you’ve been paying for it ever since. Can you smell the blood on your hands? For a while there is silence.\nJADE: JADE And what do you think, John?\nJOHN: Is it true?\nDOCTOR: (Devastated) I am... I’m so sorry.\nJOHN: Then what else is there to be said or done. You! Why don’t\nJOHN: you just destroy us both here and now. End this. We were children. Neither of us deserve this torment.'*\nDOCTOR: (Stunned) You don’t blame me?\nJOHN: You were a child. We both were. You killed Torvic to save me. You could not know what was to come.\nJADE: Or what's still to come.\nJOHN: What do you mean?\nJADE: Many years ago I made a deal with the Doctor. Then,\nJADE: again, more recently we made another. How would you like your chance?\nJOHN: Go on.\nJADE: Look at this pitiful creature. He sentenced you to a life that was no life. A life of solitude and despair. A life where everything you did failed. A life of misery.\nJOHN: He then gave me ten years of hope. Ten years of real life!\nJADE: How would you like to continue as Doctor John Smith? I offer the choice to live out your life as Doctor John Smith and let this man who betrayed you become my servant. Or...\nJOHN: Or what?\nJADE: Or you can save Jacqueline Schaeffer. JOnN She’s dead. She’s dead because of you.\nJADE: 243\nJADE: JADE And therefore she can live because of me. I’m not just a pretty face with fancy lights and bangs, you know, I can control Time. I can create Destiny.\nJOHN: Ican really save her?\nJADE: Tough one, sh? Who will you save? Yourself or the woman you love?\nJOHN: How can I save her? Tell me!\nJADE: By killing Victor.\nDOCTOR: (Devastated stil) John... don’t...\nJOHN: (Calmly) I see. And if I kill Victor, I become the Master, and your servant, once more.\nJADE: Exactly.\nJOHN: Can I discuss it with my friend?\nJADE: By all means. But keep it brief.\nJADE: There is a flash of lightening and JADE disappears. E\nDOCTOR: How? How can you call me your friend?'?\nJOHN: Let me ask you a question. How many times over the years could you have killed me?\nDOCTOR: I... I don’t know. Many times.\nJOHN: Yet, you never did. And how easy would it have been for you to kill me tonight?\nDOCTOR: I honestly don’t know if I could have done.\nJOHN: You made the deal with Death. You gave me ten years of life, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But why? Why did I do that? (Bitter) Because of guilt. JOHN And it is guilt that drives the woman I love to help those\nDOCTOR: less fortunate. None of us are perfect, Doctor. In life, none of us are good or evil.\nDOCTOR: But as the Master, that is all you are. No life. No reason.\nDOCTOR: Nothing. Darkness and solitude forcing you to kill all life.\nDOCTOR: JOHN And I have to decide whether to become that once more.\nDOCTOR: What do you suggest?\nDOCTOR: GStunned) You really care what I think?\nDOCTOR: one Do you think we would have stayed friends were it not for eath?\nDOCTOR: I can’t think of anyone else I would rather be friends with\nDOCTOR: than you.\nJOHN: I wish I could be a little more selfish now. Leave here.\nJOHN: Pretend none of this ever happened.\"\nDOCTOR: So do I.\nJOHN: My mind is made up. I know what I must do.\nJOHN: With a flash of lightning, JADE reappears.\nJADE: Tm so sorry to break up this touching little reunion but I\nJADE: need your answer.\nJOHN: 1 know what—\nJADE: (interrupts) Wait a minute.

The musical that Jacqueline and Victor have been to see, Portentum, is based on that story (the events of the story are turned into a film during ‘I Was A Monster!!!’, so the reasoning is that this was then turned into a musical stage production).

I needed the Doctor to see her briefly when he’s first brought into the house — he actually calls her “Death” at that point — then she needed to disappear so he could forget about having seen her in his initial delirious state. Jade then returns at the beginning of Part Three but disappears quickly before the Doctor rejoins the other characters. Hence the Doctor only realises that Death (or indeed anyone other than John, Victor and jacqueline) is actually in the house when john mentions jade at the end of Part Three.”\nNOTES: 77. ‘Line changed to: ‘Leek!

And he became known as the Doctor. He travelled the universe, always with friends, doing good wherever he could. Perhaps... pephape—te, in some small way, to try and make up for what he had done that day. The other, the one who had smnashed Torvie’s head into a bloody pulp, became distant as the guilt and hatred ate away at him. Gnawing at his soul. He too left their home. He too travelled the universe, but always alone, doing... doing whatever he could to survive. But... but, something was growing inside of him... evil. Wherever he travelled, so he brought death. He had no motives, no reasons... he was the Master? Gary Russell: ‘Sylvester really enjoyed this script - it gave him @ chance to play sad and sombre and with none of the scientific gobbledegook he likes to get Sophie Aldred to say!

Line changed to: ‘And you don’t know what he is like. You speak of Traken and Duchamp and ef a thousand other places. I speak of Perfugium. You can name a hundred people that the Master killed. I can name a thousand that John Smith has saved. Doctor, I do not know what it is like where you are from but here, in Perfugium, our friendships cannot be so easily broken. John Smith is a good man. And as Hyde was separate from Jekyll so is John separate from the Master of which you speak. The man you see sitting before you is a wonderful doctor. He grows tomatoes and makes his own wine. He enjoys the theatre and books and... and the company of his friends. He’s not fond of dogs or people with shifty eyes. He has failings and I wouldn’t claim that he was perfect but... but he’s a damn sight nearer to perfect than anyone else in this room. (To JOHN) John, John, tonight has been a night of surprises. Tomorrow was also to be one. For tomorrow there is to be a party in the Town Hall, in your honour. Many will attend for you have many friends. (Back to the DOCTOR) So you see, Doctor, whatever is happening tonight, whatever John has to face, he will not — he shall not — face it on his own.’ Joseph Lidster: 't really like this speech and think that Anne did an amazing job both with it and throughout the whole play. From the start, Jacqueline was a major concern for me. I didn’t want her to be a passive victim or overshadowed by the more showy characters. Hence, it is her who suggests doing something constructive about the messed-up study. She is the first one to talk back to jade/Death. She is genuinely trying to improve the situation for the poorer citizens of Perfugium. She isn't just the “love object” or the murder victim.’\nNOTES: Part FouR\nNOTES: 102.

The Doctor was there to tell him the story which we, as the listeners, would assume was to stop him killing himself, In actuality, the Doctor is telling the story to justify his repayment to Death by encouraging him to commit suicide.\nNOTES: ‘Of course, by the end of the story, the Doctor cannot bring himself to do this, and tries to save the man — who reveals himself to be Death. Gary then informed me that the situation of the Doctor telling a story to a suicidal person was already being used in Dactor Who and the Pirates. He suggested that just by changing a few lines it could be altered to the Doctor talking to an assassin.\nNOTES: ‘Gary changed the various lines. I liked the changes but felt that the scenes suggested a European-style setting. Gary cast Daniel Barzotti — who he’d recently seen play an italian in a stage play — as the assassin. Therefore, Daniel suggested minor changes — such as “Blimey!”\nNOTES: becoming “Cristo”.\nNOTES: Gary Russell: ‘indeed, Dan was in a play called Scorpa! which I'd gone to see, as Conrad Westmaas was in it. it was a two-hander and Dan blew me away.

You had neither the courage nor the good sense to stop me forever, and instead you imprisoned me in Perfugium, imprisoned me in a lifestyle that is the antithesis of all that I hold important. Of all that matterst’\nNOTES: There is then a large section of new lines added. These lines were written, after the completion of the script, by Gary Russell at the request of actor Geoffrey Beevers:\nDOCTOR: But here, John, here in Perfugium, you had friends. You had life. Something that you've denied so many others...\nJOHN: Those which deserved to die, were denied life, yes. Of course. The weak shall fall. Or follow... You should know all about having the weak follow you, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I have my companions to ease the loneliness, Master! Your loneliness is what has led you to this. To a lifetime partnership with her!\nDOCTOR: 255\nJADE: Oh, remembered I’m here, have you?\nJOHN: Jade? Death? What is she? An abstract universal entity given form to help play out this pantomime of a scenario? Here to test my mettle. And yours as well, no doubt.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure who or what she is... universal concepts are hard to pin down...\nJOHN: So,what am I, Doctor? Death’s Champion? Just as some claim\nJOHN: you are Time’s Champion? Both of us locked in a ridiculous crusade to appease intangible concepts? Pah! This discussion is worthless! I want existence back. My power.\nJOHN: DOCTOR And I want my old friend back! Not my old enemy!\nJOHN: ‘You see friendship as something good, don't you? DOCTOR Of course...\nJOHN: I see friendship as a weakness, a distraction —- an excuse to\nJOHN: give up, to never see things through to their ultimate conclusion. Why\nJOHN: should I want friendships, Doctor? Stop trying to put your values onto me! JOHN’s first line in the above extract originally read, ‘Those which deserved to die, were denied life, yes. Of course. The weak shall fall. Or follow... You should know all about having the weak follow you, Doctor... let’s discuss Miss Grant. Or my poor, dear Nyssa. And foolish young Adric... what did happen to him, Doctor? Did he deserve to die?’ It was cut down in post-production. Joseph Lidster: ‘I was very impressed that Geoff was taking such an interest in the script, and felt that the additional lines worked well. I wasn’t too happy about the references to Doctor Who's previous companions, as I felt they made the Master sound like a bit of a fan. Why would he know about Adric's death? f had also tried to keep continuity toa minimum, hence no mention of Gallifrey or the TARDIS, et cetera. The lines were then cut for timing reasons.’\nJOHN: 130. Line changed to: ‘Let me be free! Let me exist as I truly am. The universe needs me and J need all that it has to offer! Iam the Master, that is who I am, what I am, and what I need to be.’\nJOHN: 131, Line changed to: ‘Well, let me think about it. If, as an apparently non- corporeal universal concept, I can think. Oh, all right, Doctor, why not? This could actually be fun. Deal.’\nJOHN: 132. Line changed to: ‘No, Victor! Victor, why?’\nJOHN: 133. Line changed to: ‘Of course.

Slow fade-up of overlapping, whispering voices - at first indistinct but then becoming clearer.‘Murderer!’, ‘Killer!’ and ‘Destroyer!’\nTHE MASTER: The whispering gets louder and then suddenly stops, as the Master shouts, ‘No!’\nTHE MASTER: Opening music.\nTHE MASTER: We hear quiet classical-type music and the sound of a pen writing. Doctor John Smith speaks:\nTHE MASTER: ‘I write these words not knowing who will read them. Indeed, I'm not sure why I even write them. Perbaps, I feel an urge to record, for posterity, my thoughts... or, perbaps, I write as therapy for myself alone... or, perhaps, I write simply because I cannot sleep. But, for you ghosts of the future, for you shades of time to come, let me set the scene: it’s a warm evening ~ one of those nights where no matter how much air you let into the room, the heat still stifles and suffocates. And all is quiet in anticipation of an oncoming storm. And, so, as the world anticipates the storm, so I anticipate my own death. For, you see, this could be my last dark night as Doctor John Smith, respected surgeon and physician, This could be the night of my death and my rebirth as... well, as who knows?’\nTHE MASTER: ‘This morning started as any other, Upon waking with the sunlight bathing my face, I washed, dressed and ate a simple breakfast. My nurse, Jacqueline, lives in an apariment adjoining my small but comfortable bome and I called for ber shortly after eight o'clock. Jacqueline is my carer as well as my assistant, for I bave been ill for some time. We work together at the Sanatorium and waik there together every morning. This morning, as usual, ber excited chattering kept my mind from dwelling on my... on my condition.\nTHE MASTER: walking and talking. Jacqueline is babbling about a meal she had with Victor, the night before. ‘And he even offered me his bed for the night - I ask you!’\nTHE MASTER: ‘Of course, she wasn't asking me. The lady is aware of my thoughts on the dependable, respectable Victor I barely bad chance to say “good morning” in the twenty or so minutes it took us to watk to the Sanatorium. Eventually, we arrived and my sweet and generous Jacqueline was required to close ber mouth!\nTHE MASTER: colleagues. As they enter the locker area, they overhear two new nurses discussing *... Doctor Smith’s face! Have you seen it? He must have been in some terrible accident!”\nTHE MASTER: The other replies, ‘Well, I heard that he can’t even remember...’ They are interrupted by Jacqueline, who admonishes them, informing them that Doctor Smith is the most respected surgeon here and that if they have any problems they should come and speak to her! The nurses apologise and leave. Doctor Smith thanks Jacqueline and says he remembers the time when he was able to stand up for himself. He seems sad and old and Jacqueline is worried. She asks him if he will be able to work today.\nTHE MASTER: ‘John, you are an excellent surgeon, but I'm worried about you. It’s as if... as if you're fading away’ He replies that she is talking nonsense and that he'll be fine.\nTHE MASTER: 390\nTHE MASTER: ‘But she wasn't talking nonsense. 1 am fading, faster than even she knows, She has been my nurse for nearly a year now, helping me to keep going... to keep working. Although I tire quicker now, I’m still able to perform my work - thanks to the help of my sweet Jacqueline. She helps administer my medication but there's not much more she - or anyone else - can do. My physiology is unique... my condition unknown... but perhaps... perbaps after today, I will know the answer... and then perhaps I can make my feelings known...’\nTHE MASTER: there has been a fire at a local hotel and that they’re bringing many of the casualties here. There is a lor of noise as people discuss this, with one person crying that her husband worked there and everyone gets to their stations.\nTHE MASTER: Doctor Smith and Jacqueline rush to their operating theatre as the first patient is wheeled in. The ambulance driver announces that the patient appears to be a human male in his late forties or early fifties, but... ‘he's... he's not human!’ Doctor Smith shouts at him, asking him what the patient is then.\nTHE MASTER: ‘I don't know, John. I've never seen anything like this. He appears 10 have been engulfed in the flames... his clothes have melted into his skin but... his body appears to be healing itself. He's even been having brief moments of consciousness’ Doctor Smith is shocked but immediately starts to work on the unknown patient. He tells Jacquetine to start removing the patient's shirt. As we hear her cut though the material...\nTHE MASTER: And then his eyes opened! And his eyes stared straight into my own! And I watched as bis pupils grew large in recognition as this man - this unknown creature - recognised me! After ail these years, I bad found someone who knew who I was - a fact which bas eluded even me these ten years past.\nTHE MASTER: The patient shouts out.'No! Keep away from me!\"\nTHE MASTER: Doctor Smith tries to calm him. ‘You're safe. You're in the Sanatorium but we need to remove these clothes before your skin tries to heal’ The patient keeps on struggling. ‘Jacqueline, pacify him... I need him to be still. (To the patient) Listen to me, my name is Doctor John Smith. .\nTHE MASTER: The patient incterrupts,'I know who you are...’ and then fades into unconsciousness.\nTHE MASTER: ‘I tried to put this out of my mind. I needed a Clear head if I was to save his life. For three hours, Jacqueline and I struggled to keep this familiar stranger alive. At times, bis body fought along with us, at times against us. At times he seemed to give up and for one strange moment bis whole body seemed to glow with a strange unearthly light and begin to distort. Who was this man? Some sort of angel? Eventually, we did\nTHE MASTER: manage ta save him and then bis skin... bis skin began to heal itself? I watched, incredulous, as the cells seemed to seek each other out and join together And for the briefest of moments, I was jealous. 1 pondered why my own decaying form couldn't just... regenerate as his bad. My musings were interrupted by the arrival of the Gardai - or one of them anyway - who else but the decent and bonourable Victor!’\nTHE MASTER: patient. Jacqueline returns to the theatre with refreshments for John and Victor. Victor is announcing that the unknown patient is the only survivor from the fire. This naturally shocks both John and Jacqueline, and John has to sit down for a moment - disgusted at so much death. Victor is obviously keen to speak to the patient but John says he is against this, as the patient needs rest.\nTHE MASTER: The patient wakes. In a hoarse whisper, he says he will speak - but only to John. Victor\nTHE MASTER: refuses this but the patient says it will be ‘the Doctor here or no one else’. Victor and Jacqueline leave the room.\nTHE MASTER: 391\nTHE MASTER: The patient then turns on John, waking up fully - “What are you doing here?’\nTHE MASTER: John is stunned.*] work here. You know me?’The patient tells him to drop the act. ‘Sir, this is no act, I assure you. Please, tell me your name’\nTHE MASTER: The patient laughs bitterly and says he is known as ‘the Doctor’. John doesn’t laugh. ‘and you know who I am?’ The Doctor says that whatever plan John has, he will stop him. ‘I have no plan! But we're the same, you and I.\nTHE MASTER: The Doctor interrupts saying that they are not the same, not at all. John says that they both share many biological similarities. He gets quite excited saying how he has waited for this day for many years, wondering who he was, if he was the only one of his race left alive... and then has to sit down again. The Doctor, for a moment, is concerned. \"You're ill?”\nTHE MASTER: John says that he is dying. He just wishes... he just wishes he knew who he was.\nTHE MASTER: The Doctor suddenly interrupts him saying that John can kill him now.'They obviously respect you as a doctor, so why not just give me a lethal injection, or smother me with the pillow?’\nTHE MASTER: “By now, naturally, I was perplexed! This stranger, this ‘Doctor’, knew me and yet seemed frightened of me.I know my appearance can, at times, offend people, but be seemed to have a genuine fear... or perhaps batred... of me. And here be was asking me to kill bim?’\nTHE MASTER: ‘Why would I kill you? Are you perhaps mentally injured? Do you know who you are and where you are?\"\nTHE MASTER: The Doctor replies that he knows who he is and who John really is but isn't sure where he is.\nTHE MASTER: John tells him.‘You are in Perfugium. You were at a hotel when there appears to have been some sort of accident and you were caught in a fire!\nTHE MASTER: ‘Ah, yes, I remember!’\nTHE MASTER: ‘At this point, Victor returned. I was shocked to discover that be bad been eavesdropping - perbaps, bis envy of mine and Jacqueline’s friendship bad ignited a fire in his belly! He seemed determined to discover the truth from our patient. I considered the possibility that Victor and bis underlings might indeed be able to discover this creature’s identity but it was more likely that be would expire from boredom at their interminable questions. So, I presented a compromise...’\nTHE MASTER: “What if I were to take custody of the patient? He can stay at mine to recuperate and perhaps, he will be able to remember the events leading up to the fire?’ Jacqueline immediately disagrees saying that John is too tired to took after anyone else but as John points out, she will be there to help him. Victor, after some consideration agrees and leaves.\nTHE MASTER: The Doctor asks John why is he really helping him.\nTHE MASTER: ‘I still did not understand his fear Surety, be would want to belp me, as I had helped him? In the end, be seemed resigned to his fate of my hospitality and allowed bimself to be placed in a carriage’ (SFX: A horse-drawn carriage moving through the streets). ‘The journey was quiet as one companion closed bis eyes and sank into a deep sleep and as another presented ber disapproval in a dark silent stare - silence being a difficult activity for Jacqueline!’\nTHE MASTER: They arrive at John’s house. John and Jacqueline help the Doctor in. They offer him food but he declines.

John apologises but then asks him why he is so angry with him. ‘Because of who you are! Because of\nTHE MASTER: 392\nTHE MASTER: what you must have done!’ John is stung and asks him what he means. ‘The fire at the hotel? Your way of smoking me out?’\nTHE MASTER: ‘T couldn't believe be could think that of me.I may not be a perfect gentleman ~ but to think that I could be responsible for even one death... it beggared belief”\nTHE MASTER: “You really don’t know who you are, do you?’ asks the Doctor.\nTHE MASTER: John explains that everything before the ten years he has spent here in Perfugium is a blank. ‘But you know, don’t you? You know who I am!’ The Doctor says that he will explain, but in the morning. He must rest. John, disappointed, respects the Doctor's wishes and heads to his room. Just as he is leaving, the Doctor stops him.\nTHE MASTER: ‘Oh, I never did thank you for saving my life’\nTHE MASTER: John says, ‘Think nothing of it. It’s my job - I’m a doctor’\nTHE MASTER: The Doctor replies quietly, “Yes, a very masterful Doctor!’\nSEX: The classical-type music and pen SFX return.\nSEX: And as I closed the door, I wondered what bis cryptic comment meant. My excitement is beginning to fade now - who is this stranger? He does seem to know who I am but perhaps he is a madman? Perhaps, be was responsible for the fire? Indeed, there are so many possibilities as to bis identity that the one I hope is true - that be knew me from before my time bere in Perfugium - is beginning to seem remote. But, I have to know!

He is then woken by someone coming into his room. It is the Dector.

He is then woken by someone coming into his room. It is the Doctor. John asks him if he is unwell and then notices that the Doctor is carrying his scalpel.'Look at it, shining in the moonlight!’\nSEX: Suddenly, the Doctor lunges at John and begins to frantically stab him, screaming that he is evil! John’s dying screams merge into...\nSEX: The Doctor's voice telling him to wake up. Suddenly, the stabbing and screaming stops as John wakes up, face to face with the Doctor. The Doctor offers him a glass of water, and John laughs, bitterly, saying he should be looking after the Doctor. ‘You shouldn’t have to help me survive an attack of night terrors!”\nSEX: 393\nSEX: The Doctor, quietly, says he doesn’t mind. He remembers how many years ago he used to help him.\nSEX: John is excited - ‘so we did know each other? We were friends?”\nSEX: The Doctor tells him that they were once, but then... he is interrupted as a thunderstorm begins to sound outside and we hear the sound of rain bouncing onto the roof.The Doctor says he will tell John everything but first he wants to know how John came to be in Perfugium.\nSEX: John explains how ten years ago, he was found by the Monks of the Servator Monastery outside the city walls. He was unconscious and they feared he was close to death. But, as they looked after him, he had woken - but with no memory of who he was or how he had come to be outside Perfugium. For months, they had tried everything to discover his identity. The local Gardai had asked around for any missing people and the Monks had tried everything to trigger John’s memory. Eventually, they came to the conclusion that he had been in a terrible accident, which had left his physical body so horribly scarred and that had destroyed his memory.The Doctor asks him how he had come to be a surgeon at the Sanatorium. John explains how he had been working in the gardens at the Monastery when one of the monks had an accident and how he, almost unconsciously. had managed to save his life. He realised he had a skill - saving the lives of others. Perhaps, [ had performed an evil act in the past, and this was my chance to atone for it’\nSEX: As the years went by, John became the most skilled surgeon at the Sanatorium and moved out of the Monastery. And then, nearly a year ago, he had started to experience an inexplicable physical and mental pain. The Sanatorium had assigned Jacqueline to care for him - but he refused to give up working.\nSEX: “Yes, you never were one for giving up!\" says the Doctor.\nSEX: John then asks the Doctor to tell his story. The Doctor says he is a traveller and that he arrived in Perfugium the previous day. He had been checking into the hotel when...\nSEX: John interrupts him and says he is not interested in the hotel - ‘I want to know who lam and how we know each other?’\nSEX: The Doctor says that Victor placed him into John’s custody to try and discover the cause of the fire.\nSEX: John shouts: ‘I'm not interested in the fire!’\nSEX: The Doctor smiles.'So things haven't changed that much. You still don’t care about the loss of innocent lives?’\nSEX: John is shocked - by both the Doctor's indication of his past and by his own reaction. Quietly:‘I do care. It's just... to be so close to knowing who I am?”\nSEX: The Doctor says that he will teil him in good time but first asks him if the word ‘dominus’ means anything to him. John asks why. The Doctor says he wants to tell him about the fire. He had been stood in the reception area when suddenly the receptionist had stopped what he was doing. To the confusion of everyone, he had walked around locking all the doors. When the Doctor asked him what he was doing, the receptionist had stopped, shouted ‘This is for my Dominus!\" and had then set the place on fire. John says that that is horrible. The Doctor agrees, regretting that he was unable to save anyone's life.'But, then again, I usually am the one to survive as all those around me die!’ he says quietly. John asks him what ‘dominus' means. The Doctor explains that it is Latin for ‘master’.\nSEX: John wonders if the receptionist was acting on behalf of the Advena Commonwealth, a race that Perfugium has an uneasy peace with.\nSEX: The Doctor says, ‘Possibly, but I suspect not’.\nSEX: 394\nSEX: Suddenly, something registers with John. ‘You said, I s#flf don’t care about the Joss of innocent lives! What did you mean?’The Doctor asks him why he thinks he has lost his memory. John says he suspects he witnessed something so terrible that his mind has repressed it and everything else. The Doctor asks him why he hasn't tried hypnotism to restore his memory. John says he isn’t sure but the Doctor interrupts him.\nSEX: ‘You're scared, aren't you? Saving lives means everything to you... and yet, your immediate, subconscious reaction earlier indicated that you didn’t care about loss of life. You're scared that perhaps, you wouldn't like what you once were?’\nSEX: John angrily shouts at him,‘Tell me who I am! Tell me who I am!\" He breaks down and, struggling to breathe, properly asks the Doctor why he is taunting him! ‘What did I do that was so bad that you won't tell me? Why do you enjoy hurting me so much?’\nSEX: The Doctor is shocked.‘I don’t enjoy hurting you!”\nSEX: But John says that now the Doctor is the one not facing his subconscious, darkest thoughts.\"You believe that deep down I care more about you telling me who I really am, than I do about discovering why so many innocent people died yesterday - and perhaps you're right! But you are enjoying this! Were we enemies? Did we hate each other so much that you gain pleasure from this power you have over me?\"The Doctor is shocked, mainly because John is right. There is a loud lightning strike and the lights go out and John screams out. The Docior says it is okay, the lightning must have hit the power. He asks John if he has any candles.They search for the candles and light them, then sit down quietly.\nSEX: ‘You said we were once friends?’ asks John. The Doctor confirms this and says how, in childhood, the two had been inseparable - but then, as time went by, they chose different paths. John asks him what he means but the Doctor is reticent.\nSEX: As they talk, they start to like and trust each other. The Doctor is still unwilling to tell John what happened after their childhood. They talk about John’s life, Jacqueline and Victor, and John’s condition - how he is dying. The Doctor asks him if he has had ‘these night-terrors’ before. John says no.\nSEX: The Doctor says that he must be the trigger - ‘Don't you see? I’m the wigger! I'm the face from the past that's starting to trigger your repressed memories!\" He feels it would be better if he left as he makes it clear he doesn’t want John to recover his memories.\nSEX: John stops him.‘Why won't you tell me?’\nSEX: The Doctor replies that he doesn’t want to destroy his life. His life here is good and he is a good man and perhaps... if things were different they could have been friends again,'but I can’t risk triggering any more memorics!\nSEX: John starts to suspect that the Doctor must have done him wrong in the past - saying how he has confirmed they were once friends, and how his triggered memory was the Doctor trying to kill him. ‘What kind of monster are you? Did you cause me to be this way? Did you leave me for dead and then come back after ten years to destroy my new\nSEX: life?’‘The Doctor denies everything but John is not convinced - ‘And the fire? Was that so you could get to meet me?’ The Doctor again denies everything and tries to leave but John manages to physically overpower him. He starts to scream at the Doctor to tel! him everything. The Doctor sncers and says that this is more like the man he knew, which enrages John.\nSEX: Suddenly, the Doctor pushes John off and shouts at him - ‘You want to know what you were - what deep down you still might be? You create misery! You're the most evil and corrupt person in the universe. You have destroyed whole worlds and been responsible for the deaths of millions! You even killed me once! We were friends once until you became the most terrible being this universe has ever seen!’ John is, obviously, shocked\nSEX: 395\nSEX: by this and says the Doctor must be lying. The Doctor says that this is why he doesn’t want John to recover his memories. ‘Life is for living and you are finally living yours! Don't destroy it by reverting to the sick and twisted being you once were!”\nSEX: John refuses to believe this - believing that the Doctor is lying and that he must be this evil being. The Doctor says that he can show John the truth - ‘But what if you are something you despise? What will you do when you realise I’m telling the truth?’ John screams at him that he has a right to know.‘And what about the right of everyone else to live?’ John shouts at him to show him. So, the Doctor tells him to look into his eyes. As John does, the Doctor says ‘Contact’ which John finds himself repeating.\nSEX: Screams and fire and people begging for their lives and Jobn’s evil laugh and more screaming and death and...\nSEX: John pulls away.'What are these lies? What false memories are you trying to put in my mind?’\nSEX: The Doctor shouts at him - ‘Don’t you see? You are the Dominus! You are the Master!\" John panics and runs out of the house and into the rain. As he runs through the rain, he hears voices in his head begging for their lives. He shouts out that it wasn't him and as he's running we start to hear some monks chanting.\nSEX: Eventually he arrives at the Servator Monastery. He hammers on the door and a monk - Brother Antonio - lets him in. ‘John? What's wrong?’\nSEX: John can hardly speak but says he needs protecting as the man responsible for his condition is trying to kill him. His life has suddenly started to fall apart and he needs sanctuary. The other monks continue to chant as Brother Antonio locks the door behind John. He then walks around John muttering that they must welcome the cleansing fire - ‘the fire that will burn out the serpent in this paradise’.\nSEX: John asks him what he is doing when suddenly Brother Antonio shouts out, ‘This is for my Dominus!’ and the chanting gets louder and merges inte...\nSEX: Closing miutsic.\nSEX: EPISODE THREE\nSEX: Opening music.\nSEX: The Doctor shouts at him ~ ‘Don’t you see? You are the Dominus! You are the Master!’ John panics and runs out of the house and into the rain. As he runs through the rain, he hears voices in his head begging for their lives. He shouts out that it wasn't him and as he’s running we start to hear some monks chanting.\nSEX: Eventually he arrives at the Servator Monastery. He hammers on the door and a monk ~ Brother Antonio - lets him in. ‘John? What's wrong?’\nSEX: John can hardly speak but says he needs protecting as the man responsible for his condition is trying to kill him. His life has suddenly started to fall apart and he needs sanctuary. The other monks continue to chant as Brother Antonio locks the door behind John. He then waiks around John muttering that they must welcome the cleansing fire -‘the fire that will burn out the serpent in this paradise’.\nSEX: John asks him what he is doing when suddenly Brother Antonio shouts out, This is for my Dominus!’ and the chanting gets louder and then suddenly stops.\nSEX: Back at the Sanatorium we hear the two young nurses (from Episode One) having a conversation.\nSEX: ‘There's been another fire!” ‘So I hear. At the Servator Monastery?’ “Yes. The whole town is in shock.\nSEX: 396\nSEX: ‘How many dead this time?’\nSEX: ‘About thirty!\nSEX: ‘No!’\nSEX: “Yes!\nSEX: “Were there any survivors?\"\nSEX: “Well, that's the creepy thing - just one again\"\nSEX: ‘No!’\nSEX: “Yes! A man, they’re not sure who.\nSEX: ‘Well, whoever he is - he’s a very lucky man!’\nSEX: Cut to: John’s agonising screams. Jacqueline is shouting,‘Don’t let him die!’ and various doctors and nurses are trying to save John’s life.As John continues screaming, the Doctor leaves the room and Jacqueline follows.\nSEX: She confronts him in the corridor.'What did you do to him? Who are you?”\nSEX: The Doctor is impassive saying, ‘I can’t watch. She screams at him, asking him if this isn't what he wanted. The Doctor quietly says he doesn't know.\nSEX: Suddenly, John’s screams stop. They return to the room, expecting John to be dead, but one of the doctors says that they have managed to pacify him and that they think he will be okay. His body seems to be mending itself.\nSEX: Jacqueline turns on the Doctor - ‘Just like yours? Who are you?”\nSEX: The Doctor says he doesn’t have to answer her and leaves the room. Fade down.\nSEX: Fade up to the sound of John’s breathing. Jacqueline is sat next to the bed. ‘You're awake!’ He says yes, but is obviously not very well. They talk about what happened. john thinks that Victor will suspect him of starting the fire. Jacqueline says she will talk to him - she knows how Victor feels about her. John asks her why she hasn’t gone to Victor, what's holding her back. She says that John is. John refuses to believe that she loves him\nSEX: ~ because of the way he looks. She says that she loves him because of the man he is inside. He says he doesn't know who he is.\nSEX: He is starting to remember things from before he arrived in Perfugium - only small things and he is worried in case he is the evil man the Doctor claims he is. Jacqueline says that that ridiculous - she trusts him. The one person she doesn't trust is the Doctor. She thinks he is trying to frame John for something or that he wants John out of the way. John starts to feel tired so Jacqueline says she will go and speak to Victor - try and get this Doctor arrested, so that they can carry on with their lives.\nSEX: Jacqueline and Victor talk. She is explaining everything to him but he is biased against John because of his feelings for her. He then says that he wil! protect John if she does something for him. He then attacks her. She manages to fight him off and runs out. Victor, angry and blaming John, decides to visit John’s home later to try and find some evidence against him.\nSEX: Jacqueline has returned to John’s house. There she is shocked to find the Doctor. She has to restrain herself from attacking him. He tries to get her to calm down and eventually she breaks down - this is all too much for her to take, she just wants hers and John’s lives back the way they were\nSEX: The Doctor asks her if she loves John. She says she does. The Doctor still cannot fully comprehend all this. He tells Jacqueline that he is an old friend of John's and that he has come to Perfugium to see how he is but that his very presence is causing John's memories to return. And that cannot happen!\nSEX: She asks if somchow John’s returning memories are causing the fires. The Doctor says\nSEX: no; that the fire at the hotel happened before he met john and started to trigger his hidden memories. He says he needs to find out what is causing the fires. He says it is too\nSEX: 397\nSEX: much of a coincidence that the first fire happened in his presence, and the second in John’s.\nSEX: He explains to her that John and he share many biological similarities - ‘we are of the same race!\nSEX: Jacqueline is starting to believe him. She asks him what is happening then. He says that he believes that there is an alien presence in Perfugium - something that is seeking out those near John and telepathically causing them to start the fires. He’s not sure why this hasn't happened before - and just hopes he had nothing to do with it. He is at John’s to try and locate something that once belonged to John - something he thinks may be involved. Jacqueline still isn't entirely convinced. She wants to know why John’s memory returning would be so bad. The Doctor will only tell her that it would destroy their lives. He just wants to find out what else is happening and then leave. He asks her if she will trust him and heip him. He needs her to help him find ‘John’s TARDIS'.\nSEX: She asks what the TARDIS is but he again asks her if she wilt trust him and if she will help keep Victor away from him and his investigations - it will all be in John’s best interests. He asks her to look at him. She does and is almost hypnotised as he soothingly explains that he needs her to trust him and to do what he says. Almost in a trance, she says she trusts him and will help him and that she will keep Victor distracted - just as Victor walks in.\nSEX: He explodes at her - ‘All this time, I've been trusting you and trying to save you from that scarred cripple and now... now I find out it’s him that needs protecting from you!’ He calls her an evil witch ‘pretending to love me to distract me from your crimes!’ Jacqueline tries to explain but Victor advances on her. The Doctor and Jacqueline manage to run past Victor.\nSEX: John wakes up to find Victor at his bedside. He treats him disparagingly, asking where Jacqueline is. Victor gloats at him, saying that Jacqueline has found someone else and that she and the Doctor have been working together all this time. They are causing the fires and they're the ones trying to kill John. John refuses to believe him. Victor then calms down and says he needs to find evidence. The Doctor and Jacqueline are looking for John’s ‘TARDIS’. He asks John what a TARDIS is but John doesn’t know.\nSEX: He refuses to believe a word that Victor says but Victor manages, eventually, to convince him - ‘Where are they now?’ John becomes agitated and emotional, as does Victor.\nSEX: Victor shouts at him to help him but John doesn't know who to trust any more. Victor begins to enjoy John's discomfort. He is completely deranged. john tries to speak but it is barely a whisper. He gets Victor to lean forward. John then places his hands on either side of Victor's face.\nSEX: Victor is disgusted.\"What are you doing? Get your disgusting hands off me!’ He then begins to panic, as he can’t move. ‘Let go of me, John. John then, starting off quiet and then getting louder, explodes in a rage shouting for Victor to shut up. Victor starts to scream and then John snaps his neck. John is devastated and starts to cry out loud,’ What have I done? What have I done?’\nSEX: Closing music.\nSEX: EPISODE FOUR\nSEX: Opening music. Victor begins to enjoy John’s discomfort. He is completely deranged. John tries to\nSEX: speak but it is barely a whisper. He gets Victor to lean forward. John then places his hands on either side of Victor's face.\nSEX: 398\nSEX: Victor is disgusted. ‘What are you doing? Get your disgusting hands off me!’ He then begins to panic, as he can't move. ‘Let go of me, John: John then, starting off quiet and then getting louder, explodes in a rage shouting for Victor to shut up. Victor starts to scream and then John snaps his neck. John is devastated and starts to cry out loud, What have ] done? What have I done?’\nSEX: Jacqueline and the Doctor are talking. Jacqueline is saying that she thinks they should go and see John but the Doctor is using some piece of technology to detect where John’s TARDIS is. He says he is determined to stop this before things get any worse.\nSEX: John, muttering to himself, is in a state of shock. He is wandering through the Sanatorium, where people are pointing, laughing and talking at him, He keeps hearing the voices of unknown people begging for their lives and the sound of Victor’s neck snapping. Eventually he manages to find the exit and heads toward a quiet part of town. He is muttering ‘What should I do? What should I do?’ over and over again.\nSEX: Suddenly, he bumps into a small child. The child asks him what he is doing. He tells him that he has lost something and needs to find it. The child says that his mummy always tells him to think about where he left it. John ageees that this is a good thing and then remembers Victor's mention of the TARDIS. He asks the child if he has heard of a\nTARDIS: but the child says no. He wishes John good luck and leaves. John is alone and realises that he has to try and remember what a TARDIS is and where he left it. He hears the Doctor's voice goading him that deep down he is scared to remember his past. He hears Victor goading him about Jacqueline. He decides he has to try and remember. He calms himself down and clears his mind. He starts to repeat the word 'TARDIS' over and over again, forcing himself to remember...\nTARDIS: Lots of random voices - but especially the Doctor and Jobn - from brief scenes in or about TARDISes - John’s voice clear over the top asking himself if is TARDIS was bis bome or a means of transport - little scenes with some of Jobn's more violent thoughts occasionally playing over the top and then Jobn forcing himself net to remember them. The child's voice repeating ‘Where did you leave it?’ and then suddenly...\nTARDIS: ‘I remember!’ says John as he starts to head off.\nTARDIS: We hear the hum of John's TARDIS and the Doctor's and Jacqueline’s voices echo around it. Jacqueline is stunned at how it is bigger on the inside. The Doctor compares it to John’s mind and body - outwardly one thing but inside... He starts to explore - looking for what could be causing the fires - when Jacqueline interrupts him. She has found what appears to be a translucent creature - similar to a foetus - in a glass cage full of liquid. The Doctor congratulates her and says that they make a good team, when suddenly John arrives.\nTARDIS: He turns on Jacqueline, accusing her of betraying him. She denies everything but John isn’t convinced and starts to almost turn violent. The Doctor begs him to stop and think about what he is turning into.'At first, you have these angry thoughts... how soon before you start to enjoy them - and then how soon before you kill!\"\nTARDIS: John is shocked - not only at the Doctor's comments but also at how at home he feels\nTARDIS: in “this dark, evil place’ The Doctor is worried - he asks John if he has ever felt fully at home in Perfugium?\nTARDIS: John says no and the Doctor again likens the TARDIS to John’s mind. He says that they have to act now to stop any more of John’s memories being triggered.\nTARDIS: Jacqueline still does not understand how John’s memories returning would destroy them all, but John says he is beginning to understand. He finally admits that he doesn't want to remember what he was but that he wants to live out his last few months with Jacqueline, in peace. :\nTARDIS: 399\nTARDIS: The Doctor is happy but then feels compeiled to tell John, against his better judgement, that if John regained his memories of what he was, that he would be able to live longer - as John’s struggle for lengthening his life was one of his main attributes.\nTARDIS: John says he will be happy to continue lengthening the lives of those around him. He asks that Doctor what has been causing the fires. The Doctor points to the creature in the glass cage. He explains that it is a Scordatura - a parasitic being that lives between dimensions - in a place where reality and dreams cannot be separated.\nTARDIS: He says that they are a violent race and that he feels that John was working with this one - ‘perhaps waging some war on some innocents somewhere’ - when John may have betrayed it. They have incredible mental powers and if John had betrayed it then it may have attacked him - causing him to lose his memory and ejecting him from his TARDIS.\nTARDIS: Jacqueline says she does not understand. She is starting to disbelieve the Doctor and wonders if indeed this was not all part of his plan. She still cannot believe that John was ever this evil being when suddenly the Scordatura smashes its way out of the box and launches itself at her with a hideous screech.\nTARDIS: Possessed by the Scordatura, she explains what happened. She explains that the Doctor is right: ten years ago it and John - or the Master as it knew him - arrived here during some war they were waging and that, indeed, the Master had betrayed it. It had fought him and banished him from both the TARDIS and his mind. It had also absorbed. all of the Master's memories. This had exhausted it and it has spent the last few years recuperating. Recently it had awoken and decided to complete its one task - to kill his Dominus - the Master. Using its telepathic powers it had searched out for a human near to a being with two hearts and forced him to commit suicide - through burning himself and all those near him to death (at the hotel). It had then realised its mistake and had tried again (at the monastery). It will not make the same mistake again.\nTARDIS: It forces Jacqueline’s body to try and attack the two men.The Doctor tells John to keep back - as he fears that if John fights he will return to his old self.'I’'m a trigger, this place is a trigger - if you take just one life it could destroy you for ever!’\nTARDIS: John struggles to control himself as the Doctor manages to knock the Scordatura off Jacqueline - where it splashes about on the floor squealing. The Doctor tells John to take Jacqueline and leave this place and never return.‘Turn your back on death and live your lifer”\nTARDIS: John asks him what he is going to do but the Doctor tells him to leave. He tells John that he is a good man and he wishes that they could be friends - like once they were before. John takes Jacqueline and leaves.\nTARDIS: Alone, the Doctor looks down at the Scordatura - he says to himself that he is going to do something he should have done years ago. He blames himself for his friend becoming the Master and all the deaths that the Master then caused. He sees the Scordatura as not only the physical embodiment of the Master's evil but also as the embodiment of his own guilt. He walks around the TARDIS pondering how easily he could have followed the same path as his old ftiend. He then rigs the TARDIS console to explode. He won't let his guilt over his friend's descent into madness and evil be his Dominus any more. He leaves with a parting ‘Sweet Dreams’ as the console explodes and the Master's TARDIS and the Scordatura ace destroyed forever. The sound of the\nTARDIS: explosion merges into...\nTARDIS: The pen SFX and classical-style music.\nTARDIS: ‘it bas been an interesting day. I look back at last night's diary entry and it seems as if it was written by a different man - I suppose it very nearly was. I was so certain that I would be able to recover my memory and therefore my life, but it appears that\nTARDIS: 400\nTARDIS: by remembering who I was, I would have been destroying not only myself but ail those around me. The flashes of memory I did bave have convinced me that the Doctor was telling the truth - my past was not something to be embraced but my present is! I bave decided that I will do as be suggested - I will stay here in Perfugium and live out the last few months of my life content with my sweet Jacqueline. 1 came so close to lasing ber today but I believe that she will recover from her ordeal. Now she sleeps in the very chair that the Doctor occupied just a few short bours ago.As for Victor... that is something I will never be able to erase from my memory... but I cannot... I wili face my demons about that... about what I did, another day. The Doctor? He has disappeared as mysteriously as he arrived. Although I bave no regrets about not remembering much of my past, the one regret ts that I will never remember my friendship with bim.1 believe that he probably was the best friend I ever had and I do believe that bis actions bere today have confirmed that completely. Exhaustion is overpowering me now - as I said, it bas been an interesting day So as night falls once more, as darkness steals the light, so I say good night.\nTARDIS: He puts down the pen and closes his diary. Before he gets into bed he mutters that he will check on Jacqueline one last time. He goes through to his living area. He quietly calls Jacqueline’s name but there is no answer. He kisses her on the forehead but then realises she is cold.\nTARDIS: He then notices a note in her hand. Panicking, he reads it aloud. In it Jacqueline describes how when possessed by the Scordatura she glimpsed what John had been like before Perfugium, She reminds him how, in the Sanatorium, she had told him she loved him because of who he was inside but now... now she knew who he really was inside and that is something she cannot live with. She has taken an overdose of John's\nTARDIS: painkillers,\nTARDIS: John struggles to breathe and as the wind and rain begin to pick up once more outside he hears the whispering voices - ‘Killer!’,‘Murderer!’ and ‘Destroyer!’ He drops to his knees, screaming, ‘No! and then begins to cry. His crying turns into a hysterical reaction and his mind finally reminds him who he is. He goes mad and starts to smash up his home, laughing. He is, once more, the Master!\nTARDIS: 401\nMASTER: TRAILER By Joseph Lidster\nMASTER: tempo throughout the trailer as appropriate.\nJOHN: My dearest friends, I write this letter in the hope that you will do me the greatest of favours.\nMAN: (Scene One) What do you want?\nMAN: JOHN On the 23rd of this month, I would be honoured if you\nMAN: would join me here, in my home, for dinner.\nJACQUELINE: (Scene Five) I don't seem to have a knife.\nJOHN: It ig ten years since my arrival in this town - an anniversary I feel I cannot possibly ignore.\nVICTOR: (Scene Five) And let us celebrate!
