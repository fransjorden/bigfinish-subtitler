Listen!\nHURLEY: Don’t you shush your master!\nCATHY: Can’t you hear? There are voices...!\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 4\nTEGAN: This way! I can hear voices.\nNYSSA: And lights! Doctor, there are lights. There’s a building of some kind...\nTEGAN: A mansion, by the looks of it.\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING THROUGH BRANCHES) Hold on, I’m a bit caught up in these branches... (FREE) Ah! Yes, it is rather a big house, isn’t it?\nWILLIAM: (DISTANT) Hello? Who are you?\nHURLEY: (DISTANT) Where the devil did you come from? What was that horrific hullaballoo?\nNYSSA: They don’t look very friendly.\nDOCTOR: Well, we shall just have to tread carefully — (STUMBLES) Argh!\nNYSSA: Doctor? Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: Perfectly, I — (WINCES) Ow! I seem to have twisted my ankle.\nTEGAN: So much for treading carefully.\nHURLEY: (CLOSER NOW) Who the devil are you people?\nDOCTOR: Hello! I’m the Doctor. I’m terribly sorry to have ended up\nDOCTOR: dropping in on you like this, in the middle of the night...\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 5\nPAST: TICKING GRANDFATHER CLOCK.\nTEGAN: Nice place you’ve got here!\nHURLEY: Yes, come on, come on. I’d rather hear you people explain yourselves in the drawing room, rather than stand around outside.\nDOCTOR: You’re very kind. (WINCES AGAIN)\nHURLEY: Good God — what are you wearing, all three of you?!\nNYSSA: Clothes?\nWILLIAM: Never mind, sit down. Cathy? Fellow here looks in need of something restorative.\nCATHY: I’1l get Cook to warm some milk.\nHURLEY: Milk, by hang! Brandy’s what’s required here.\nDOCTOR: (SITTING) Really, you mustn’t go to any bothevr...\nHURLEY: (CALLING) Dodson! — Dammit, where is that butler? (CALLING) We need drink here! On the double!\nTEGAN: Isn’t that the drinks cabinet just over there?\nDOCTOR: Shush, Tegan.\nHURLEY: Dodson!\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 6\nWILLIAM: Father, you’ll be waking up mother. She needs her rest...\nHURLEY: I told her not to leave her room, until I knew what’s going on. (TO DOCTOR) And I’m still none the wiser, sir!\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. Well, that was our fault. My fault, really. It was my ship.\nWILLIAM: Ship?\nHURLEY: We’re a long way from the sea!\nDOCTOR: This will take some explaining.\nHURLEY: And we will sit here until you have explained to my satisfaction how and why you’ve managed to bring down the finest stand of oaks in all of Cheadle Hulme.\nWILLIAM: Father, calm down. They seem like reasonable people...\nHURLEY: Causing explosions in the night? Reasonable? My heart nearly leapt out of my chest! I thought revolution had come! — Now you,\nHURLEY: sir, will explain what you mean about a ‘ship’!\nDOCTOR: (DEEP BREATH) Well...\nWILLIAM: In the morning, perhaps? — Father?\nHURLEY: Very well, in the morning. But I’1ll have my answers then, sir — you see that I don’t!\nCUT TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 7\nCUT TO: OF DOOR AS CATHY LETS HERSELF INTO LOWLY DWELLING BELONGING TO\nHER: FATHER. CRACKLING FIRE.\nROBERTS: Cathy?! — Where have you been, girl? You should have been back hours ago.\nCATHY: Shush, father. Everything’s fine. Here, you’ve let the fire burn down...\nROBERTS: The child was up through the night. He won’t settle unless you’re here...\nCATHY: There was a something strange going on. I was needed.\nROBERTS: (MORE HEATED) I need you here. So does your... little brother.\nCATHY: Hush. You’1ll wake hin...\nROBERTS: Bargain was, you’d be here to do all the household tasks, same as your mother used to. Then I can keep working, and doing early starts.\nCATHY: I know that, father. I’m here, aren’t I?\nROBERTS: The pittance you make at Hurley Hall won’t keep us, will it? I’ve got to work. Even sick as I am.\nCATHY: Things will get easier...\nROBERTS: They will, will they? And when’s that?\nCATHY: You’11l see. Things have to get better.\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 8\nROBERTS: I don’t see how. And I don’t see your fancy friends changing anything, either. Not any time soon.\nCATHY: (LAUGHING) What fancy friends have I got?\nROBERTS: You know who I mean. That lot you fell in with. Speechifiers. Talkers.\nCATHY: There’s nothing wrong with talking.\nROBERTS: Rabble-rousing. That’s what it is. And you won’t be allowed to get away with it.\nCATHY: Come on, Dad. Get this tea. Have you time for porridge?\nROBERTS: Tend to yourself. And prepare the boy’s breakfast. He’1ll hear your voice and want to be up. I have to go. But tell me — why were you out all night?\nCATHY: Oh! They had an emergency up at the Hall. It was the oddest thing... these people, strangers, turning up out of nowhere. Like no-one else you’ve ever seen. They claim they just fell out of the sky. In some kind of box.\nROBERTS: I don’t like the sound of that. What were you needed for?\nCATHY: I had to see to them. Get them rooms sorted out. The Hurleys of Cheadle pride themselves on their hospitality, you know...\nROBERTS: Oh yes, the big man in his high castle. I still don’t like the sound of all this. Folk dropping out of the sky...\nCATHY: Quite nice folk, as it turns out. They were very friendly to me.\nROBERTS: You take far too much interest in life outside this house. You've got duties here.\nROBERTS: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 9\nCATHY: This is about the march tomorrow, isn’t it? You don’t want me to go.\nROBERTS: No, I don’t. You or the child.\nCATHY: But it’ll be the most important thing that’s ever happened to me.\nROBERTS: The most important things are here.\nCATHY: It’s only one day!\nROBERTS: I forbid it. Do you hear me, Cathy? You’re not going anywhere!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: Ah, it’s you two. Good.\nTEGAN: How’s your ankle this morning?\nDOCTOR: Sore.\nNYSSA: Oh, your room is lovely, too. What a beautiful house this is...\nTEGAN: Yeah, if you like that sort of thing. I can’t stand all those servants hanging around...\nNYSSA: Do you know when and where we are, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not entirely. I must go back to the TARDIS and check her over at the first opportunity.\nNYSSA: I hope she’s all right.\nDOCTOR: Tough as old boots. I hope. — Anyway, broadly speaking, we’re sometime in the early nineteenth century, somewhere south of Manchester.\nTEGAN: Come on, you two. Whenever and wherever we are, I’m starving.\nNYSSA: Someone was bashing a gong before.\nDOCTOR: Yes. It means, ‘Breakfast is served.’\nTEGAN: More bowing and scraping. Still...\nNYSSA: Why is it you don’t like the servants, Tegan?\nNYSSA: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 11\nTEGAN: I didn’t say I didn’t like them. I just don’t like to see people treated like slaves.\nNYSSA: They seemed happy enough in their work.\nTEGAN: They’ve got no choice!\nDOCTOR: Not the way the world is run at this point in time, no.\nTEGAN: (LAUGHING) You can talk — you’re a posho, too!\nDOCTOR: I am not a ‘posho’.\nTEGAN: Course you are, you’re a Time Lord. Nyssa’s told me all about Gallifrey, don’t you worry...\nDOCTOR: Nonetheless, we’re not here to change the world. We’1ll have a nice breakfast, then it’s back to the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: We could carry you down on a litter, if you like?\nDOCTOR: Ssh.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 12\nCROSS TO: DOCTOR, TEGAN & NYSSA ENTER.\nHURLEY: (GRANDLY) Ah, the good Doctor and his friends. Our esteemed guests!\nDOCTOR: Good morning, sir.\nHURLEY: Hurley, please. We don’t stand on ceremony here. Actually, we do, my wife rather likes it. Come and sit, come and sit...\nTEGAN: I’m ravenous.\nNYSSA: This all looks wonderful...\nHURLEY: That idle son of mine will be down soon. He seems to need more sleep than anyone else.\nNYSSA: William? He seemed very nice.\nHURLEY: He’s had everything on a plate, that boy. Just handed to him, like I never had.\nDOCTOR: You're a self-made man, I take it?\nHURLEY: Give me a man who’s worked his way up in the world. Who knows how things tick. That’s what the country needs. A man who knows all the nuts and bolts.\nTEGAN: You’ve done all right for yourself, yeah.\nHURLEY: You're a very outspoken young miss.\nDOCTOR: She’s from abroad. Raised in the bush.\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 13\nTEGAN: Just hang on a moment...\nHURLEY: Colonies, eh? Explains a lot. And your other niece, hm, Doctor? She looks like she could be an exotic princess of some kind.\nNYSSA: I’m not actually a princess, but I am from somewhere more exotic than Cheadle Hulme.\nWILLIAM: Good morning, father. And... er, everyone else.\nHURLEY: Stirred yourself, have you?\nWILLIAM: I’ve been out with Dodson and the others, as it happens. We’ve been surveying the... ah, damage.\nHURLEY: Have you, by gad? And what did you find?\nWILLIAM: Just a few lopped branches, really. It sounded worse that it is.\nTEGAN: Well, hurrah for the trees.\nWILLIAM: And our, um, guests are speaking the truth.\nHURLEY: In what sense, sir?\nWILLIAM: There is, in fact, a blue box amongst the oaks. Lying on its Side and utterly impregnable.\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s TARDIS, yes.\nWILLIAM: (TO DOCTOR) A ship. You called it your ship, sir.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I did, didn’t I? Well, I can’t really explain too much about it...\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 14\nHURLEY: It’s an invention, isn’t it? It’s something very clever. Very new.\nTEGAN: How would you know that?\nHURLEY: My dear, I am an engineer. An industrialist. I can smell something new when it drops in my lap. Something valuable.\nWILLIAM: I’m not sure it looks valuable exactly...\nHURLEY: You must show it to us, Doctor. This ‘ship’ you arrived in. William — fetch men and tackle, so we can right the Doctor’s vessel.\nWILLIAM: Very good, father. (EXITS)\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that’s a good idea.\nHURLEY: Do you not, sir? Well, I think it is. I’1ll have you know, I’ma magistrate. My word is law round here, as it happens.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS would be of no interest to you.\nHURLEY: You've accepted my hospitality in return for honest answers. So: we’ll finish our breakfast; then we’ll go and have a gander at this box of yours, hm?\nHURLEY: FADE.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 15\nHURLEY: WILLIAM.\nCATHY: William! Am I in trouble? I’m late...\nWILLIAM: Calm yourself, Cathy. Why are you so worked up?\nCATHY: It’s my dad. He had a right go at me about getting home so late last night.\nWILLIAM: He doesn’t like you working here, does he?\nCATHY: He doesn’t like anything I do.\nWILLIAM: I don’t suppose he’s going to be very pleased about this famous march of yours tomorrow...\nCATHY: You don’t take it serious either. I should never have told you about it.\nWILLIAM: I do take it seriously. I think you shouldn’t get involved.\nCATHY: I must. It’s about people’s livelihoods and about you lot... you tycoons and landowners and... and you just laugh about it...\nWILLIAM: I’m not laughing about your cause! I’m sure it’s all very laudable and important. It’s just you! My little pal. Cathy Roberts the kitchen maid.\nCATHY: Those days are gone, Master William. We live in different worlds. Life is more serious now.\nWILLIAM: Perhaps so. But what about those strangers though, eh? They seem rather colourful and out of the ordinary...!\nCATHY: You just like the look of the girls. — Look, I’d best get inside. Cook will have my guts for garters...\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 16\nWILLIAM: (IMPULSIVE) Cathy...\nCATHY: What is it?\nWILLIAM: I’m glad you’re back with us at Hurley Hall. When you went away last year.. down south to your cousin’s.. I thought we’d lost you forever.\nCATHY: I belong here. I’m not going any time soon.\nCUT TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 17\nCUT TO: TARDIS.\nHURLEY: That’s it, you men... Careful, now! Don’t damage the precious box any further!\nDOCTOR: This is very kind of you.\nHURLEY: It’s most exciting, Doctor. This flying machine you claim to have piloted into my garden... it’s nothing more than a miracle! Whoever imagined such a thing?\nDOCTOR: Well, it isn’t really a flying machine, you see...\nDOCTOR: CROSS TO — TEGAN AND NYSSA STANDING TO ONE SIDE:\nTEGAN: I presume we’re going to run for it at some point...?\nNYSSA: That depends what damage the TARDIS has suffered.\nTEGAN: So, we might be stuck here a while?\nNYSSA: At least it seems a civilized sort of era.\nTEGAN: You think?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Ah! I think I can get through now...\nHURLEY: (OFF) Stand aside, men...\nTEGAN: Doctor? Do you need us?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, COUGHING ON SMOKE FROM INSIDE TARDIS) Ah...!\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 18\nTEGAN: Did you see that? There’s smoke coming out of the door!\nHURLEY: (OFF, CALLING TO DOCTOR) Shall I instruct my men to fetch buckets?\nDOCTOR: (OFF, CALLING BACK) No, there’s no fire... but there seems to be quite a lot of damage...\nTEGAN: Rabbits. We’re going to get stuck here, and I’1l end up becoming my own great-great-grandmother, won’t I?\nNYSSA: The chances of that happening are remarkably slim.\nHURLEY: (OFF, CALLING TO DOCTOR) Don’t lock yourself away in your strange box, Doctor...!\nHURLEY: NYSSA3: I don’t like that man much.\nTEGAN: He seems a bit of a bully. But his son’s all right.\nNYSSA: (ARCH) Do you think so, Tegan?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS’ automated repairs will take a day or two. We just\nDOCTOR: have to wait.\nHURLEY: So you can’t do a demonstration for us?\nDOCTOR: Not today, I’m afraid.\nHURLEY: What a disappointment! — Come on, everyone. Back to work. No more gawping.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 19\nHURLEY: & TEGAN.\nNYSSA: Doctor? How long do you think we’1l be stuck here?\nDOCTOR: Not long. I made it look a bit more dramatic than it really is. I don’t want Mr Hurley demanding to see inside the TARDTS...\nTEGAN: Good idea.\nDOCTOR: What I really wanted to do was find out when and where exactly we are in time.\nNYSSA: And?\nDOCTOR: According to the instruments we’re in August eighteen-sixteen. Four miles south of the centre of Manchester. Something was niggling at me, you see... something I was trying to remember...\nTEGAN: Hang on. The master of the house is coming over...\nHURLEY: (ARRIVING) That was most diverting! The Doctor and his magic box! Perhaps later you could have a go at sawing your two ladies in half, eh? Hahaha!\nDOCTOR: Quite!\nTEGAN: Hilarious.\nNYSSA: Why would he want to saw us in half?\nHURLEY: Listen, I’ve had a thought. Why don’t I give you a tour, Doctor? A man of learning like you. You’d be very interested!\nDOCTOR: Of your house?\nHURLEY: House? It’s just a house. Nothing interesting about that. No, man. My pride and joy! My factory!\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: Oh! Well, yes, that would be splendid.\nHURLEY: It’s just a short ride into town...\nDOCTOR: This will be most interesting, I’m sure.\nTEGAN: Yeah, riveting.\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY, TO COMPANIONS) Nyssa, stay here, would you? The\nTARDIS: will repair herself mostly, but she may require your help...\nNYSSA: Of course, Doctor.\nTEGAN: I wish we could just leave.\nDOCTOR: I’m very interested in this factory of his. Aren’t you, Tegan? This is your history, after all!\nCUT TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL)\nCUT TO: Page 21\nCUT TO: POUNDING, THRESHING. GIGANTIC LOOMS AT WORK. NB: VOICES PITCHED SLIGHTLY UP OVER NOISE.\nHURLEY: What do you have to say about this, then?\nDOCTOR: It’s certainly very impressive.\nHURLEY: There’s nothing like it in the whole of the North West. Nay, in\nHURLEY: the whole country, Doctor.\nTEGAN: These machines... they’re huge!\nDOCTOR: Beautiful, aren’t they?\nTEGAN: Monstrous, more like. How do people manage to work here and\nTEGAN: stay sane?\nHURLEY: Money in their pockets, in’t it? I support half the families in\nHURLEY: south Manchester by providing them with work here.\nDOCTOR: It’s all quite an achievement.\nTEGAN: So, you’re spinning yarn from cotton...\nHURLEY: That’s right, Miss Jovanka.\nDOCTOR: Brought up the ship canal from Liverpool, and before that, from\nDOCTOR: America.\nTEGAN: So it’s the slave trade.\nHURLEY: Beg pardon?\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 22\nTEGAN: Cotton picked by slaves in America, brought here to be spun by people on slave wages in Manchester...\nDOCTOR: Broadly true.\nHURLEY: My people aren’t slaves!\nTEGAN: You sure about that? Look at them. They look — [il1..] (REALISATION) Wait, those are children over there!\nDOCTOR: Yes. — Mr Hurley, I must say, the conditions here in your mill aren’t exactly the best. Rather worse than I’d hoped, [in fact]\nWORKERS: (OFF) Watch out there!/Oh, look! Have a care...!\nHURLEY: What’s that, sir? — Hang on... there’s something going off on the factory floor. Some fuss about nothing, as per usual.\nWORKERS: (OFF) Someone help him!/Get him out of there!\nTEGAN: There’s someone caught up in the workings!\nHURLEY: (SHOUTING) What’s going on down there?\nDOCTOR: I can’t see from here. (CALLING) Someone stop the engines!\nHURLEY: NO! The machines can’t stop!\nDOCTOR: Hurley, listen! There’s someone injured down there!\nTEGAN: It’s a child!\nHURLEY: Of course it is — only the kiddies are small enough to get underneath the machines, to pick up the waste and the chaff.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: He’s trapped. He’s been injured. Take my coat, Tegan.\nTEGAN: What are you doing?\nHURLEY: Keep away from there. There’s nothing to see.\nDOCTOR: I’m going underneath. I’m going to save him.\nHURLEY: Doctor!!!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 24\nCATHY: (STOPPING NYSSA) Miss Nyssa, isn’t it?\nNYSSA: That’s right.\nCATHY: I thought you’d gone into town with the others.\nNYSSA: No, I was just going to check on the TARDIS—\nCATHY: Oh, your blue box, of course.\nNYSSA: I saw you out in the garden last night, didn’t I?\nCATHY: That’s right, Miss. I was the first one out when your party... arrived.\nNYSSA: It wasn’t a conventional materialisation. It must have come as something of a shock.\nCATHY: The words you lot use! I don’t understand some of them at all.\nNYSSA: Oh!\nCATHY: Never mind, I mustn’t keep you. I should get on with tidying the drawing [room. ]\nMRS HURLEY: (FROM OFF) Cathy!\nCATHY: Now I’m for it.\nMRS HURLEY: (WALKING FORWARD) Cathy, you mustn’t bother our guests. You have been warned before about talking to your betters.\nMRS HURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 25\nCATHY: Yes.. Mrs Hurley.\nMRS HURLEY: (TO NYSSA) Good morning, my dear. I gather you are one of our impromptu visitors? I’m sorry I was too wretched to get up from my sick bed in the middle of the night in order to greet you...\nNYSSA: Yes, I’m Nyssa. You must be Lady Hurley.\nMRS HURLEY: Oh, merely Mrs. I’m not a Lady. Not yet.\nCATHY: Mrs Hurley means that her husband hasn’t been knighted yet, for his services to industry, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Oh, I see! (SHE DOESN'T)\nMRS HURLEY: Cathy, you are impertinent.\nCATHY: Yes, Mrs Hurley.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 26\nSPECTATING: WORKERS.\nHURLEY: (CALLING, FROM DOORWAY) Back to your duties, all of you! There’s nothing to gawp at over there! — Here, Doctor, let them\nHURLEY: clear up the mess!\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (FX: CLOSING DOOR BEHIND HIM) The boy’s clear of the mechanism now. His lacerations seem superficial, but he’s very badly bruised.\nTEGAN: Shouldn’t we get him to hospital?\nHURLEY: Hospital, by hang! He doesn’t need an expensive hospital.\nWILLIAM: I’ve just heard.. I was in the depot. What’s gone on?\nHURLEY: Our Doctor friend here’s been a bit of a hero.\nTEGAN: He saved that child’s life!\nWILLIAM: Which child?\nDOCTOR: He’s still down there on the factory floor. I must get back to him. I’1l need bandages, and, uh, surgical spirit?\nHURLEY: William, answer that.\nWILLIAM: Yes, Father.\nWILLIAM: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 27\nWORKERS AT DOOR: (OFF) We’ve come for ‘im./We mun’t take him home, to his people.\nTEGAN: The boy’s alive, that’s the important thing. Maybe that’s the reason we came here, Doctor? So you could save him. For all we know, he’ll grow up to be someone important...\nHURLEY: I shouldn’t think so, my dear. He’s just a factory hand. A raggy urchin.\nWILLIAM: (RETURNING) Father, the boy’s people are here. To take him home.\nHURLEY: Let them have him! We don’t want any fuss. (TO WORKERS) Go on, then. I’ve had him looked at by an expert here — this Doctor! Take the boy home! Only get a shift on! I can’t have sickly kids lying about all over the place, taking up space. We’ve all got to get back to work! Chop chop!\nTEGAN: I don’t believe this. — Mister Hurley!\nWILLIAM: Tegan, don’t aggravate my father. You’1ll make it worse...\nTEGAN: Make what worse?\nDOCTOR: Hurley, the boy’s condition needs stabilising before he goes home. I’ve not yet cleaned his wounds properly.\nHURLEY: Doctor, you’ve done more than enough.\nTEGAN: (ACCUSINGLY) They’re not even people to you, are they?\nHURLEY: What?!\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 28\nTEGAN: The Doctor’s trying to help that boy and all you’re concerned about is getting the machines going again!\nDOCTOR: Tegan, this isn’t helping.\nTEGAN: I’1ll show you helping. I’m going after those people right now, to see that the boy gets home OK.\nWILLIAM: You can’t go off with that lot! Alone, I mean...\nTEGAN: I don’t need a bodyguard.\nWILLIAM: You’re new to this city. I insist.\nTEGAN: (SIGH) Come on, then.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll see you later, back at the Hall. (FX: DOOR CLASHES) Now,\nDOCTOR: Mr Hurley — we need to talk about this factory of yours.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 29\nMRS HURLEY: Sit with me, Miss Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Thank you.\nCATHY: (AT DOOR) May I go, Mrs Hurley?\nMRS HURLEY: Yes, yes, be off with you.\nCATHY: Very good, madam. (TURNS)\nMRS HURLEY: Wait! Before you go — tell me, how is that small brother of yours? How is Peter?\nCATHY: Oh, he’s thriving. An absolute devil. He’s so clever... and bonny.\nMRS HURLEY: You and your father are extremely lucky, my dear. To have new life around you. New possibilities. How wonderful to have a child to treasure like that...\nNYSSA: Who is this baby she’s talking about, Cathy?\nCATHY: My brother, Miss. He’s our miracle baby.\nMRS HURLEY: Perhaps... one day you might bring him up to the Hall?\nCATHY: (SURPRISED) Yes, Mrs Hurley, if it can be arranged...\nMRS HURLEY: It’s been a long time since this place had any new life or laughter within its walls. I would be most grateful, Cathy.\nCATHY: I’1l talk to my dad. He’s not best pleased with me just now, though.\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 30\nMRS HURLEY: He is a good father. He has stuck by you.\nCATHY: He has forbidden me from going on tomorrow’s march.\nMRS HURLEY: This march! I wish they’d call it off.\nMRS HURLEY: NYSSA3: What kind of march is it to be?\nCATHY: It’s our chance. The working people. We’re all getting together and marching into Manchester. There’1ll be speeches and banners and music... It’ll be like one big jamboree!\nMRS HURLEY: I agree with your father. I don’t think you should go.\nCATHY: You forget, madam, what it’s like to be a working person and to feel like we do. You’ve been married so long to a rich man.\nMRS HURLEY: (OUTRAGED) Catherine Roberts!\nCATHY: It’s true, though - that you were one of us once, Mrs Hurley? You lived in the same village, did the same work. Ordinary, like the rest of us.\nMRS HURLEY: I don’t need lecturing by you — a servant girl!\nCATHY: I didn’t mean anything bad by it!\nNYSSA: (AWKWARD) Perhaps I should go.\nMRS HURLEY: You stay where you are, Miss Nyssa! Being told where I belong... by you, Cathy! By a girl who’s no better than she ought to be! Get out, girl! Out of my Sight...!\nCATHY: I — yes, Mrs Hurley. (EXITS)\nMRS HURLEY: (CALLING AFTER) Don’t bother bringing that brat of yours here! Don’t you ever bother coming back here, for that matter!\nMRS HURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 31\nNYSSA: Please, Mrs Hurley, don’t be rash. I’m quite sure Cathy didn’t mean any offence.\nMRS HURLEY: Oh, so you presume to lecture me also?\nNYSSA: No, that’s not it at all —\nMRS HURLEY: Then you can get out and all!\nNYSSA: (GETTING UP) I’m very sorry, Mrs Hurley —\nMRS HURLEY: Go on, out! You don’t belong in my house either!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 32\nHURLEY: There’s more to you than meets the eye, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s been said before.\nHURLEY: I think I need to keep you close. You’re a very intriguing individual. Clever. Brave.\nDOCTOR: You flatter me.\nHURLEY: I think I’d like to pick your brains...\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s handy, Mr Hurley, because I you and I should have a talk, about industrial relations. About changes you ought to make in the future?\nHURLEY: I am a man of the future. I believe in the coming age. It’s eighteen-nineteen, Doctor. Great challenges lie ahead.\nDOCTOR: Eighteen-sixteen, surely?\nHURLEY: -nineteen, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (GRIMLY) Eighteen-nineteen. Are you sure?\nHURLEY: My son might treat me like an old fool, Doctor, but I think I can be trusted to know what year it is.\nDOCTOR: (WORRIED) Then the TARDIS was wrong. The pollutants damaged the chronometer after all. I thought it was eighteen-sixteen.\nHURLEY: What are you talking about, man? How can you doubt which year tt ase?\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR: Eighteen-nineteen. Eighteen-nineteen. — Come on, Doctor. Think! Why does that year fill you with dread? (PACING ABOUT) And the place... the location... Hurley: what month is it?\nHURLEY: It’s August. August the fifteenth, eighteen-nineteen!\nDOCTOR: (STOPS DEAD. AGHAST) Then... I’ve brought my friends into the midst of disaster.\nHURLEY: What are you talking about?\nDOCTOR: It’s August the fifteenth, eighteen-nineteen. We’re in Manchester.\nHURLEY: So?\nDOCTOR: I’ve let my friends wander free in the city.\nHURLEY: Miss Nyssa’s back at the Hall. Miss Tegan is with my son. No harm can come to either of them, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand, Hurley. We’re on the eve of the darkest day in this city’s history. No-one is safe here!

We’re in\nDOCTOR: Manchester.\nHURLEY: So?\nDOCTOR: I’ve let my friends wander free in the city.\nHURLEY: Miss Nyssa’s back at the Hall. Miss Tegan is with my son. No harm can come to either of them, Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand, Hurley. We’re on the eve of the darkest day in this city’s history. No-one is safe here! No-one!\nCROSS TO: 14. MANCHESTER CITY SLUMS — DAY\nTEGAN: I thought I’d been in some grim places before, but this is terrible.\nWILLIAM: These are the slums. It’s what they’re like the world over.\nTEGAN: We’re completely lost, aren’t we? I wanted to see that the boy was all right...\nWILLIAM: They’re like rabbits in a warren. They vanish into holes and scurry away.\nTEGAN: They’re not animals, William!\nWILLIAM: I wasn’t meaning to suggest (that)...\nWILLIAM: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 35\nTEGAN: But that’s your attitude, isn’t it? You and your dad and your type. The people who live in conditions like this, they’re just sub-human to you.\nWILLIAM: I don’t know what you mean...\nTEGAN: You can’t see it, can you? Look at how they have to live, William. Just look at it.\nWILLIAM: Some of them pull themselves up by their bootstraps and do well for themselves.\nTEGAN: Easy for you to see, given how you and your family live — compared to this.\nWILLIAM: My father came from a poor background. And he did well for himself.\nTEGAN: So? What does that prove?\nWILLIAM: Confound it, woman, are you always this argumentative?\nTEGAN: Yes!\nWILLIAM: Look, the point is — if my father can rise to the top, then anyone can.\nTEGAN: No, they can’t. And anyway, does that justify people living like this?\nWILLIAM: I don’t know. (UNEASY, LOWERS VOICE) I just know I don’t like the looks we’re getting here. They’re watching us from every corner.\nTEGAN: I know. (SIGHS) All I wanted to do was for us to see that boy, to see his people, his parents. And to tell them he’1l be all right... and for you to say sorry...\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 36\nWILLIAM: Well, we’ve lost them. And we were foolish to wander into the heart of the stews. We’re vulnerable here.\nTEGAN: Maybe you’re right. But I’m glad we came. Now I’ve seen how people live here. What life is really like.\nWILLIAM: Yes, well done. You’ve spent five minutes looking and being appalled.\nTEGAN: What?\nWILLIAM: Your compassion is misplaced, Tegan. These people won’t thank you for taking pity on them.\nTEGAN: Look here, you [ jumped-up—]\nWILLIAM: Look, shall we go somewhere more convivial? My barracks in Mount Street aren’t far.\nTEGAN: Your barracks? You never said you were a soldier!\nWILLIAM: You don’t know anything about me, and yet you saw fit to judge.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 37\nCATHY: Father? Are you here?\nNYSSA: Is this where you live, Cathy?\nCATHY: If I’d had my own way, I’d have moved away years ago. I don’t want to spend my whole life in Cheadle Hulme.\nCATHY: (WALKING OVER TO COT) Peter! He left you here alone.\nNYSSA: (FOLLOWING) Oh, he’s beautiful.\nCATHY: Peter, meet Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Hello, Peter.\nCATHY: Hold him, if you like?\nNYSSA: Oh, I’m not very good with (babies).\nCATHY: Rubbish! (HANDS HER THE BABY) There. You’re a natural.\nNYSSA: He’s your... brother, you say? You must have lost your mother quite recently.\nCATHY: It was horrible. A horrible illness. Dad will never recover from her loss. I can see it all over his face.\nNYSSA: What was Mrs Hurley getting upset about, back at the Hall?\nCATHY: She’s doo-lally. Well, we don’t want to see her anyway, do we, Peter? You can do without that mad old woman in your life. The Hurleys don’t have anything that we need.\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 38\nNYSSA: Their financial assistance would be useful, though. And what about your job?\nCATHY: I’ll find something else. I can do anything.\nNYSSA: You’re very confident.\nCATHY: We have to be, don’t we? Otherwise it’s easy to go under and give up hope.\nNYSSA: I suppose I was given everything... what was it Mr Hurley said about his son, William? He was given everything on a plate. I suppose I’m that privileged, too.\nCATHY: Well, in your case it hasn’t spoiled your character and made you weak and foolish.\nNYSSA: Don’t you like William?\nCATHY: I did, once. We grew up together. Mum worked in the kitchens at the Hall. She took me to work, and I saw Will everyday. We used to play out in the grounds. He used to make me laugh.\nNYSSA: And now?\nCATHY: He’s the enemy. He’s one of the enemy. (BRIGHTLY) Come on, Nyssa. You can help me. I’ve a lot to do before tomorrow. There’s banners to help make, and placards to paint.\nNYSSA: Banners for your famous march?\nCATHY: It’ll be like nothing this city has ever seen before. Thousands of people are going to gather in St Peter’s Square in the centre of Manchester. And I’m going to speak! I’ve been asked to give a speech! I can hardly believe it. — Oh, Nyssa, will you come with us? It’1ll be grand.\nNYSSA: Well, I’m not sure...\nNYSSA: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 39\nCATHY: But you must! It’s a once in a lifetime thing! You have to come\nCATHY: along!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 40\nCROSS TO: WHICKERING OF HORSES; CLIPPED HEELS.\nTEGAN: What kind of soldier are you, William? You never said anything about all of this...\nWILLIAM: I’ve got hidden depths, eh? There’s more to me than meets the eye. I’m a Captain!\nTEGAN: But how? You work in your father’s factory, don’t you?\nWILLIAM: You don’t understand much, do you? How do you think the city is protected, eh? How do you think honest, law-abiding citizens get to go about their business in peace?\nTEGAN: The police?\nWILLIAM: The Doctor’s magic box said something about ‘police’ on the front. I supposed you were from London, or Glasgow or somewhere. No, we don’t have that here.\nTEGAN: You've got your own private militia.\nWILLIAM: Exactly! Paid for by the great and the good, by the likes of my father. By the fathers of the city, in fact, who all know how best this place should be run.\nTEGAN: But that can’t be right!\nWILLIAM: Why not? — Come and see the horses, they’re magnificent...\nTEGAN: So what do you do..? Just dress up in your finery and trot around on your horses? How can you hope to keep the peace and defend people?\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 41\nWILLIAM: We carry swords! — Ceremonial swords, really. But we train with them, and in a fight I’m sure we could acquit ourselves pretty well...\nTEGAN: I don’t know about all this, William. It seems like rich boys dressing up and playing at justice...\nWILLIAM: Does it, now?\nTEGAN: I keep spouting off, don’t I?\nWILLIAM: You do a bit, Miss Tegan.\nTEGAN: I’m just trying to understand how things work here.\nWILLIAM: Wait here with the horses. The diamond one is Jack. He’s mine. Stay with Jack, while I report to my commanding officer. I need to find out what my orders are for tomorrow.\nTEGAN: Tomorrow?\nWILLIAM: (WALKING OFF) It’s going to be a big day for us...!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 42\nHURLEY: Here we are again, Doctor. Home sweet home.\nMRS HURLEY: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Hadn’t you best introduce me to your guest...?\nHURLEY: Ah! There you are, my dear. You’re out of bed.\nMRS HURLEY: I suppose you’d prefer me to languish forever in my room?\nHURLEY: But your nerves, my dear.\nMRS HURLEY: My nerves are shattered anyhow.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Hurley, I’m the Doctor. One of the visitors who arrived so unexpectedly last night.\nMRS HURLEY: Oh, yes, indeed. I haven’t yet recovered from all that brouhaha.\nHURLEY: My dear, the Doctor’s arrival is fortuitous. He is a brilliant man, and is developing some wonderful ideas about improving productivity at the mill.\nMRS HURLEY: Oh, you and that mill and your stupid business rivals. All of you competing and dashing around...\nHURLEY: If I didn’t compete, my dear, we wouldn’t have the lives we have, and this house and all the luxuries you enjoy.\nMRS HURLEY: Enjoy? I don’t enjoy anything anymore. — You, Doctor. I met one of your friends. Nyssa, was it? Funny name.\nDOCTOR: Yes, indeed. Is she here?\nHURLEY: The Doctor is concerned for the whereabouts of his companions.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: (LETTING WORRY SHOW) They do tend to drift off when I’m not paying attention and it is rather imperative that I get them together.\nMRS HURLEY: She’s gone now.\nDOCTOR: Gone where?\nMRS HURLEY: I presume she went after that maid, once I’d dismissed her. That Cathy Roberts.\nHURLEY: You dismissed Cathy?\nMRS HURLEY: You know how that girl can forget herself. Well, enough is enough. I will not be spoken to so insolently [in my own home]\nHURLEY: But of all the staff, you’re fondest of Cathy. And surely she needs every penny, too, with that child and all...\nDOCTOR: I’1ll have to go after them.\nHURLEY: Surely there’s no hurry, Doctor? I can send one of my men to fetch her, if you like. I’d rather you stayed and talked to me about your ideas.\nDOCTOR: I think I’d rather go myself. Where does Cathy live?\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 44\nNYSSA: But what I understood was that, in this day and age... in this country... women weren’t listened to with the same respect as men?\nCATHY: That’s true enough. Isn’t it the same where you come from?\nNYSSA: It’s so long since I was home. I can hardly remember what it was like. But it wasn’t like this.\nCATHY: Things are changing here. I’m going to stand up in front of that crowd tomorrow, and I’m going to talk about things just the same as any of those men. About injustice and poverty and everything!\nNYSSA: Won’t you be nervous?\nCATHY: I can’t afford to be nervous about it! Someone’s got to tell them, haven’t they? Someone’s got to stand up and tell the truth.\nNYSSA: How many people are going?\nCATHY: They say there’1ll be thousands pouring into Manchester tomorrow. From Oldham, Preston, all over Lancashire. From all over the county, north and south. And probably from further afield as well. I don’t care what my father says. I’m going. And so is Peter.\nNYSSA: You’re very brave.\nCATHY: It’ll be a piece of history. People will remember this. They’re starving, Nyssa. And they’re bullied and pushed around by those few who’ve got a bit of money behind them. It’s not right.\nNYSSA: I think I will come with you. To the march. If that’s all right.\nNYSSA: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 45\nCATHY: That’s wonderful! I knew you would. You already feel like a good friend, Nyssa. Plus, you can help with the baby.\nNYSSA: Have you written your speech?\nCATHY: Everything I need to say, it’s already in my head. I know what’s important. When I get up on a platform, it’s funny, but I always know just what to say. It comes easy to me. And folk listen, too. They always listen.\nNYSSA: Tegan will want to hear you. The Doctor will too, I’m sure.\nCATHY: Then you should tell them. Like I say, Nyssa, I reckon tomorrow’s going to be a day no one’s ever going to forget. — I\nCATHY: can’t let my father stop me. We need to leave now, before he gets home from work. Help me with the baby’s things...\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 46\nCROSS TO: IN FRONT OF TEGAN.\nWALTON: You. What are you doing here? We don’t allow females in here.\nTEGAN: I’m waiting for my friend. William Hurley?\nWALTON: I doubt Lieutenant Hurley would have left a strange female unaccompanied in the barracks.\nTEGAN: He’s with his superior officer, or something. Getting his orders for tomorrow?\nWALTON: Ma’am, I’m afraid I don’t believe you.\nTEGAN: There’s nothing I can do about that. He told me to wait here with the horses and — (SHE’S GRABBED) — hey! Get your hands off me!\nWALTON: (GRIPPING TEGAN) I’m afraid I’m going to have to remove you from the barracks.\nWALTON: What kind of accent is that? — You’re a saboteur, aren’t you?\nTEGAN: You’re crazy. Let me go...!\nWALTON: You’ve been caught skulking around in the stables. Who knows? You might have been harming the horses...\nTEGAN: Why would I do any such thing?\nWALTON: Trying to hamstring the horses. Yes, we were warned about this.\nWALTON: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 47\nTEGAN: I love horses, I grew up with them. I wouldn’t do anything of the sort!\nWALTON: You radicals won’t stop at anything. Luckily, I’m within my powers to put you away.\nTEGAN: What? Where?\nWALTON: It might teach you a lesson.\nWILLIAM: What the devil’s going on? — Tegan? What have you done?\nTEGAN: What have I done? Tell this idiot to get his hands off me!\nWILLIAM: That ‘idiot’ is a Captain in the cavalry!\nWALTON: I caught this woman skulking round the stables, Lieutenant. Obviously up to no good.\nTEGAN: I wasn’t skulking! I was waiting for him!\nWALTON: She had the effrontery to suggest that she was here as your guest.\nWILLIAM: Well, as a matter of fact —\nWALTON: I’m not sure what would be thought of your sneaking strangely- attired, roughly-spoken females into the barracks.\nTEGAN: Roughly-spoken?! — You haven’t heard the half of it!\nWALTON: I’m locking her up overnight. We can’t take the chance.\nTEGAN: What?! — William, tell him!\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 48\nWALTON: Whoever she is, she’s not the sort of woman you ought to be fraternising with, Lieutenant. Whatever would your father say?\nWILLIAM: Tegan, I’m sorry, but...\nTEGAN: William...!!!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 49\nROBERTS: What is it you want? Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Are you Cathy’s father? Mister... Roberts?\nROBERTS: Might be.\nDOCTOR: I’m here looking for my friend Nyssa. She was last seen with your daughter.\nROBERTS: There’s no-one here now. You can see for yourself.\nDOCTOR: But they were here?\nROBERTS: I know you. I saw you up at the factory on Oxford Road. You were there with the bosses!\nDOCTOR: That’s right. I’m the Doctor.\nROBERTS: It was you saved the boy. Risked your life.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it wasn’t as dramatic as all that...\nROBERTS: Way I heard it, it was. Step inside for a moment, if you must.\nDOCTOR: (STEPS IN) Thank you. Hurley’s factory is not a very safe place. I’m going to do what I can to get him to improve conditions.\nROBERTS: That’1ll do no good. He’1ll listen to your ideas, but if any of them cost money, you can forget it. He’s all about the profits. They all are. They don’t care for the likes of us.\nDOCTOR: Well, he seems to want to hear my ideas. And for all his bluster, I think he was genuinely concerned about the injured boy.\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 50\nROBERTS: Was he really? (CYNICALLY:) Enough to not dock his wages?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Would Hurley do such a thing?\nROBERTS: Like he wouldn’t! But it’s the way of the world. We can’t all be bosses and owners and Doctors.\nDOCTOR: I suppose not. — Look, this is very important. Do you know where your daughter might have gone? And Nyssa?\nROBERTS: I dunno anything about your Nyssa. But I know what Cathy’s done, against my express wishes. She’s taken the babby as well.\nDOCTOR: Where, man? Where’s she gone?\nROBERTS: There’s an encampment. Down on the green. They’re getting ready for tomorrow. Like any of it could ever make a difference...\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 51\nCROSS TO: AND LAUGHTER; DISTANT ACCORDION MUSIC AND CLAPPING.\nCATHY: Isn’t it wonderful, Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Is this everyone in the village?\nCATHY: Oh, many more than that. Cheadle’s a tiny place. But people are gathering here, as planned. There’s room for everyone to pitch their tents.\nNYSSA: Yes, it’s like a fairground. Funny, when everyone’s gathered to complain. Not that they don’t have a lot to complain about.\nCATHY: We'll draw enough attention to ourselves — peacefully, mind — that they can’t ignore us anymore.\nNYSSA: The Doctor always thinks he can change the world, too.\nCATHY: Too many people just give in. They think nothing they do will ever count.\nNYSSA: The Doctor’s taught me that we always need to try to make things better.\nCATHY: This little one will grow up knowing that it’s possible. I’1l teach him that, if nothing else.\nNYSSA: Will he be warm enough, though? If we stay out overnight?\nCATHY: It’s a warm night. They’1ll be up for hours, singing and chanting. I want to meet everyone. I want to stay up all night...\nNYSSA: Perhaps you should have left your brother at home.\nCATHY: (SHARPLY) No! He stays with me!\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 52\nNYSSA: Oh! I’m... sorry.\nCATHY: No, no, I’m sorry, Nyssa. You’ve been nice to us. I shouldn’t have been so sharp. Come on — I’1l1 introduce you to my local group, and the committee.\nNYSSA: Who?\nCATHY: They’re the ones who’ve put me forward to speak!

Are you going to join this silly jamboree?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa is among the crowd somewhere, but I’m not having much luck finding her. It’s essential I do, you see, [because...]\nWILLIAM: Is she joining the march tomorrow?\nDOCTOR: I’m very much afraid she might be.\nTYLER: (BESIDE WILLIAM) Does this mean that you know what this lot have planned for tomorrow, sir?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, who’s this?\nWILLIAM: Ah! Allow me to introduce my travelling companion — Mr Thomas Tyler, an old school friend of mine. Thomas, this is the Doctor — a friend of the family, you might say.\nTYLER: Pleased to meet you, sir.\nWILLIAM: Thomas has come up from London, especially for the march.\nDOCTOR: Not taking part?\nTYLER: I’m a newspaperman, sir. I like to call myself an “investigative reporter”.\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 54\nWILLIAM: Can you credit it? A London news-sheet, sending a fellow all the way here to witness the proceedings with his own eyes.\nTYLER: It’s my job to get a true picture of what occurs.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know what an investigative reporter does.\nTYLER: It’s a new thing. Perfect for me. I like to be in the thick of things.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure. — William, where’s Tegan?\nWILLIAM: Ah, that’s something I should have told you about straight away.\nDOCTOR: What?\nWILLIAM: Climb aboard and I’1l1 explain on the way back to the Hall. They’1ll be ringing the gong, and I know Thomas will be ravenous...\nTYLER: Absolutely. Climb aboard, Doctor!\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. (SITS) Thank you.\nWILLIAM: Carry on, cabby.\nDOCTOR: William, you went with Tegan. What happened?\nWILLIAM: Tegan and I became completely lost in the slums and... well, we had a bit of an argument about the poor, and then...\nDOCTOR: Then what?\nTYLER: Who is this Tegan, eh? Not some floozy you’ve collected, Will?\nWILLIAM: After she’d done fighting with me, she picked a fight with a cavalry officer.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nWILLIAM: Made herself sound like a saboteur. A radical.\nDOCTOR: Where is she now?\nWILLIAM: Well, he locked her up in the barracks overnight.\nDOCTOR: She’s a prisoner? And you left her behind?\nWILLIAM: He put her in custody overnight. Teach her a lesson. That’s all.\nTYLER: Best thing for her. Can’t have women running about being insubordinate!\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: Why didn’t you tell me this straight away?!\nWILLIAM: I’m telling you now. She wasn’t at all happy. but she won’t come to any harm, I promise you.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you realise how serious this is!\nWILLIAM: Tegan will be safe in the barracks, Doctor. It’s in the grounds of the Magistrates’ house. Probably the safest place in the city.\nDOCTOR: I want to get her out, right now.\nWILLIAM: We can’t do that tonight, Doctor. It’s too late. Tomorrow will be soon enough. She’s safe, believe me.\nDOCTOR: You’d better be right.\nWILLIAM: You worry too much. (CALLS OFF) Driver!

When they’ve had mass protests before, the authorities have tried to say they were full of troublemakers. We don’t want to give them the excuse of thinking that.\nNYSSA: No-one would bring their children if they wanted to cause trouble, I suppose.\nCATHY: I wouldn’t bring Peter along if I thought that there’d be bother.\nCROWD: We’re moving!/We’re off!/This is it now!/Come on!\nCATHY: Look, they’re on the move already! Come on, let’s join the line...\nNYSSA: How far is it from here?\nNYSSA: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 58\nCATHY: We've a few miles to go — all through the suburbs, up Oxford\nCATHY: Road. We should be in the city by mid-day.\nNYSSA: I just wish I’d managed to get a message to the Doctor and Tegan...\nCATHY: I’m sure they’1ll be there. Everyone’s attention will be on St Peter’s Field today.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 59\nWILLIAM: Ah! Morning, Doctor! Big day today!\nTHOMAS: A hearty breakfast’s what we all need, wouldn’t you say?\nDOCTOR: William. Nyssa’s room is empty. She didn’t come home last night.\nWILLIAM: I’m sure she’ll be all right, with Cathy looking after her.\nDOCTOR: William — I need to get into the city as soon as possible. Before the march gets there, if I can.\nTHOMAS: Hold your horses, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: My friends are — very probably — going to be caught up in the events of the day.\nTHOMAS: The protestors claim it’s going to be a peaceful day. A friendly demonstration! Why so worried?\nDOCTOR: This day is going to go badly wrong. There’s going to be a disaster.\nWILLIAM: What? How do you know this?\nDOCTOR: There’s going to be mayhem and death on a grand, unthinkable scale. Now, you must get me into the city, gentlemen. At once.\nWILLIAM: We are going there straight after breakfast. We have our allotted roles in the day’s proceedings. My father’s there already, he set off for the barracks first thing.\nDOCTOR: The barracks. You said Tegan would be safe in the barracks. Has he gone to get her out?\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 60\nWILLIAM: I shouldn’t think so. He’s gone there to report for duty.\nDOCTOR: For duty?\nWILLIAM: But surely you knew? My father and I are part of the yeomanry.\nDOCTOR: (ASTONISHED) You’re both soldiers?!\nWILLIAM: In our spare time, yes.\nTHOMAS: It is a noble calling. The city of Manchester is safe in the yeomanry’s hands.\nDOCTOR: Not today, it’s not.\nWILLIAM: We’ll be there to keep everyone safe.\nDOCTOR: But you won’t. Not today!\nTHOMAS: You need to explain yourself better, sir.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll explain on the way into town. William, we have to get my friends out of there!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 61\nCROSS TO: OF THE SOUTH OF THE CITY.\nCRIES: Come and join us!/Universal suffrage for all!/Bread for all!/ /Decent wages for a decent day’s work! [ETC]\nCATHY: The Yeomanry arrested me on Market Street. Last year, sometime. Dragged me off for distributing what they called filthy propaganda to the hoi-polloi.\nNYSSA: What was it, to make them react like that?\nCATHY: It was for women. Advice. Just medical facts about avoiding unwanted pregnancy. Basic things that every woman needs to know about. But we aren’t allowed to talk about things like that.\nNYSSA: Whyever not?\nCATHY: They put me in their stinking gaol. They were going to leave me there. But Mr Hurley spoke up for me. He’s one of them, you see. The Yeomanry. He and William both. They love dressing up and all. But on that occasion, he did speak up for me, so Peter wouldn’t go without his— (CATCHES HERSELF) — his sister.\nNYSSA: I think I’ve guessed your secret, Cathy.\nCATHY: I don’t know what you mean. Come on, we’re lagging behind...\nNYSSA: Peter’s not your brother. He’s yours.\nCATHY: Hush, Nyssa. I’m not supposed to say.\nNYSSA: It’s obvious by the way he looks at you. And you at him.\nCATHY: Please, Nyssa! I have to keep my secret, or I could lose him. They could even take him away from me!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR: (CALLING, OFF) Tegan? Where are you? — Tegan, it’s me...!\nTEGAN: What? (LEAPING UP FROM STRAW) Doctor! I’m here, in the cell! (AS HE COMES OVER TO TEGAN’S CELL:) Thank goodness you’re here. They left me locked up in here all night!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I heard you got into a fracas with one of the cavalry.\nDOCTOR: Shall I let you out...?\nTEGAN: You’ve got keys?\nDOCTOR: William had keys. It turns out he’s a soldier. Him and his father.\nTEGAN: Yes, he said.\nDOCTOR: It’s important. They’re up to their necks in all this... (DOOR UNLOCKED) There, that’s the one.\nDOCTOR: Out you come.\nTEGAN: Up to their necks in what? They’re just playing at soldiers.\nDOCTOR: It’s more than just playing. It’1ll lead to disaster.\nTEGAN: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS got the date wrong. It isn’t eighteen-sixteen. It’s three years later.\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 63\nTEGAN: So? Look, can we get out of this prison, it’s driving me mad.\nTEGAN: HOOVES ON COBBLES, AND SABRES BEING SHARPENED.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa’s out there somewhere. In the gathering crowds. I’ve not been able to find her.\nTEGAN: Doctor, something’s wrong. Look — the men are sharpening their sabres. They’re supposed to be ornamental.\nDOCTOR: They’re preparing for battle.\nTEGAN: Who against? What did you mean about the date, exactly?\nDOCTOR: I’m an idiot. Even with the TARDIS playing up, I should have seen the signs.\nTEGAN: What signs?\nDOCTOR: It’s the sixteenth of August, eighteen-nineteen. It’s the day of the Peterloo massacre. This city is about to go to war against its own people.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 64"

This city is about to go to war against its own people.\nSOLDIERS: To the hussars!/To us, gentlemen!/Let us pray for good sport today!\nWILLIAM: Father, what are you doing here?\nHURLEY: Ah, there you are, my boy...\nWILLIAM: Have you been drinking, before mid-day?!\nHURLEY: Calm yourself, William. We always start off at the Tavern.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 65\nWALTON: (LEANING IN) Your lad’s looking a bit jumpy there, Hurley. Wet behind the ears. Hasn’t even broken his boots in.\nWILLIAM: Father, I must talk with you. It’s about the Doctor —\nHURLEY: You need to get a drink down you, boy. Steady your nerves. (CALLING) Porter for my lad, landlord!\nWILLIAM: I’m not drinking with you. We’ve got to get out there!\nWALTON: Still — he’s keen to see action. Reminds me how I was. How we all were. At Waterloo. (MOVES AWAY) I’1ll see you both on the field!\nHURLEY: (AS HE LEAVES) The yeomanry of Manchester are honoured to have your infantry by our side today, Walton.\nWILLIAM: Father, the Doctor says that today will go badly. That there will be disaster!\nHURLEY: Rubbish! All will be well. We’re having the Riot Act read, as is proper. If the protestors pay no heed — well, then they’11 have no-one to blame but themselves.\nWILLIAM: Blame for what? Father?\nHURLEY: (LOUDLY) A toast! Everyone! To... upholding the peace!\nSOLDIERS: Upholding the peace!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 66\nCROSS TO: BARRACKS. DOCTOR & TEGAN WALKING HURRIEDLY, ON A MISSION.\nTEGAN: There must be thousands of people out there!\nDOCTOR: Eighty thousand or so. The records don’t agree exactly, but far more than the city fathers were expecting.\nTEGAN: So what goes wrong?\nDOCTOR: Almost everything. We don’t want to be in the caught at the heart of it. — This way, I think...\nTEGAN: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: The barracks belong to a private militia run by the city magistrates. They’re the ones who control what happens today.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: There’1l be a good vantage point from the magistrates’ building. (STOPS AT TOP OF STEPS) We’1ll have a better chance of spotting Nyssa from here, rather than at ground level.\nTEGAN: Can’t we just stop it happening?\nDOCTOR: You know we can’t, Tegan. But we can... ameliorate things a little, perhaps. — Come on, this is where the magistrates are.\nDOCTOR: Wait! There’s someone coming...\nREV SMALL: Hello? Hello there? Is this the place?\nREV SMALL: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: That depends, sir.\nREV SMALL: I’m the Reverend Mr Small. There’s some little task the magistrates need a man of my experience to carry out...\nDOCTOR: Well, lead the way, sir.\nREV SMALL: I was rather flattered to be asked. The most important men in town, asking me!\nTEGAN: Mind your step, there...\nREV SMALL: Thank you, my dear. Of course, it was quite a struggle, coming through the crowds. What a terrible lot they are!\nTEGAN: They’re protesting. That’s all.\nREV SMALL: They need a lesson in how to behave themselves. Good job I’m here.\nTEGAN: Why? What are you going to do?!\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY, WITH DREAD) Oh no. This is how it begins...\nREV SMALL: (PROUDLY) I’m going to read the crowd the Riot Act.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 68\nPROTESTORS: Justice and freedom for all!/They can’t deny us if we stand together! /Lancashire lads and lasses!/Yorkshire workers! [ETC]\nCATHY: Nyssa... take Peter for a bit, would you?\nNYSSA: Of course. He’s so good. He’s hardly made any noise at all.\nCATHY: He’s used to noise; to my father coming in at all hours, crashing about...\nNYSSA: How are you feeling now, Cathy?\nCATHY: Excited. Scared. It’s even better than I thought. All those faces! There are so many of us.\nNYSSA: What are they chanting? I can’t make it out?\nCATHY: Does it matter? How can they not listen to such a hullaballoo?\nNYSSA: Who?\nCATHY: The rich ones! They have to pay heed to our pleas!\nNYSSA: I just hope they won’t feel threatened by all this...\nCATHY: But how could they, Nyssa? It’s just... wonderful!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 69\nCROSS TO: ST PETER’S FIELD. FOOTSTEPS STOP AND THE CROWD NOISE FROM\nOUTSIDE: EXPANDS.\nTEGAN: That view. Doctor, look at them all!\nDOCTOR: I can’t see Nyssa.\nREV SMALL: A terrible rabble. Stand back from the window — sir, madam. My duties today are vital for protecting the liberty, order and property of the citizens of Manchester!\nTEGAN: Doctor — what did the Reverend mean about reading the Riot Act?\nDOCTOR: It’s a warning to the crowd. By law, if he reads out a warning to desist and they ignore him, then the meeting can be declared unlawful. And if it’s unlawful, they can send the troops in. It’s the lynchpin of this whole disaster. — But where are your witnesses, Reverend Small? Where are the magistrates?\nTEGAN: Probably hiding from the “rabble”.\nREV SMALL: They’1l be doing good works elsewhere. You two will be my witnesses as I perform my solemn act!\nTEGAN: Come off it. Who’s going to hear you reading from here?\nREV SMALL: I shall now say my piece. (COUGHS GRANDLY) “Our sovereign Lord the King commands all persons assembled to disperse themselves peaceably to their habitations...”\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 70\nPROTESTORS: Hark at us!/Fair treatment and wages for all!/Freedom and justice and bread for all!

The old fool up at the\nHURLEY: window — see?\nWILLIAM: What’s he saying? I can’t make out a word!\nHURLEY: He’s reading them the Riot Act.\nWILLIAM: But no-one can hear!\nHURLEY: Pity, that — ain’t it?\nWILLIAM: But that’s not fair!\nHURLEY: What’s fair got to do with it? We’1ll show them!\nWILLIAM: Ohh, I want no part in this!\nHURLEY: You're already part of it, boy. On the side of the city fathers.\nCROSS BACK TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 71\nREV SMALL: (ALOUD) “.. upon the pains contained in the act made in the first year of King George I for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies.

We must find Nyssa.\nREV SMALL: (MURMURS) I have done my duty. Now, may God have mercy upon\nREV SMALL: their clamorous, unhappy souls.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 72\nCROSS TO: AND CELEBRATORY. IT SOUNDS LIKE A FOOTBALL CROWD.\nPROTESTORS: (PUSHING AND SHOVING) Let us through!/Make way!\nNYSSA: (SHOVED) Hey, watch out!\nCATHY: Give Peter back to me, Nyssa. — There, there, baby... all will be well.\nNYSSA: It’s becoming much more rowdy. I don’t like this.\nCATHY: Everyone’s excited. — Look, at the Deansgate end, can you see the crowd parting?\nPROTESTORS: The speakers!/The speechifyers!/They’re here!/Come and hear!\nNYSSA: Maybe it wasn’t such a good idea, bringing Peter.\nCATHY: It’s a peaceful day. Everyone’s in their Sunday best. There’1l be no trouble.\nNYSSA: I don’t know what half these banners mean: “Equal Representation.” “Vote by Ballot.” “Annual Parliaments.”\nCATHY: You’1l know what that one means.\nNYSSA: Where? Oh, yes. “Love.”\nCATHY: That’s all it says. Respect, kindness, and fellow-feeling. That’s what all this is about. (ANXIOUS) I’ve got to get to the hustings. They’re expecting me on the platform.\nCATHY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 73\nNYSSA: Which way?\nCATHY: We’re aiming for the big building, with the pillars, see? The\nCATHY: Free Trade Hall.\nNYSSA: But we’ll never get there through the crush!\nCATHY: I can’t let them down. I said I’d give my speech!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: The crowds are even thicker now.\nTEGAN: There’s William! (CALLING) William, over here!\nWILLIAM: Tegan! (COMING OVER) So you’re out.\nTEGAN: Well, don’t sound so disappointed!\nWILLIAM: It might be safer in the cells, than out here.\nDOCTOR: William, where’s your father?\nWILLIAM: They’re leading the advance on the crowd. Doctor... things aren’t as they should be. I never knew they were doing all of this, I swear...\nDOCTOR: All of what?\nWILLIAM: I’ve just been checking the streets, all the approaches to St Peter’s Fields. Portland Street, Lower Mosley Street... they’ve sealed them off!\nTEGAN: But that’s madness!\nWILLIAM: They’ve got special constables out, and all the cavalry.\nTEGAN: Well, I hope you’re satisfied, “Yeoman” Hurley!\nWILLIAM: I might look the part, but I’m not part of this, Tegan. I’ve told my father that, too. It’s wickedness, that’s what it is.\nTEGAN: You said it!\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 75\nWILLIAM: There’s more. They’re setting up field guns on Mosley Street.\nDOCTOR: What?!\nWILLIAM: As if this were a battlefield. As if we were at Waterloo...\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 76\nSTILL: BUT UNSETTLED, SNORTING AND STAMPING.\nWALTON: (PULLING HORSE OVER) Captain Hurley, you witnessed the reading of the Riot Act?\nHURLEY: I did, sir. And the crowd paid no heed whatsoever, persisting in this insurrection.\nWALTON: Good. Then I shall address the cavalry.\nTYLER: Mr Hurley, sir! Thomas Tyler... remember? The newspaperman?\nHURLEY: Stand back, Tyler. You’re alarming my horse. Stand down, sir. Keep out of this.\nTYLER: I am only here to observe, as you well know.\nWALTON: (TO FORTY-STRONG CAVALRY) On my mark, men. We will proceed through the crowd, undeterred. We will march on the Free Trade Hall in order to arrest the speech-makers and rabble-rousers before they can even begin to deliver their vile orations.\nTYLER: What’s that, sir? You can’t ride horses through the crowd!\nHURLEY: Hold your tongue, man. What would you know?\nTYLER: There are too many people! They’re too tightly packed!\nWALTON: (CONTINUING ADDRESS) Present arms. Use the flat of your blades only. Our mission is to send them scuttling back to their sewers.\nTYLER: But you’ve sealed off the whole of St Peter’s Fields. The crowd has nowhere to disperse to!\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 77\nWALTON: Silence, sir, or you’ll be the first to feel the flat of my blade!\nHURLEY: You mark his words, Thomas Tyler...\nTYLER: Look at these men, Hurley — they’ve been drinking! They’re in no fit state!\nHURLEY: A little snifter to stiffen the sinews, that’s all!\nTYLER: And the horses are agitated...

I look upon this sea of marvellous, bright faces [and wonder how it could be possible that the fathers of this city, or any other city in this land of ours, could fail to take notice of our demands...]\nCATHY: That’s Mister Hunt, I think. They say his voice carries clear across fields. He’s famous for it.\nNYSSA: Well, I can’t make out a word he’s saying. What’s he talking about?\nCATHY: The rights of ordinary people. So we can vote who rules over us. So we can afford even simple things [like bread. ]\nCATHY: Hush, Peter, hush. — I’m so stupid, Nyssa. What was I doing bringing him here?\nNYSSA: Let me take him for a while.\nCATHY: No!

The peasantry. Even if men like Mister Hurley were to offer to pay for every last one.\nNYSSA: Why do you say that?\nSISTER: Because we will take their names.

(COTTONS ON) Hang about, are you saying —\nNYSSA: I’ve a suspicion that the child was his.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 109\nARE: DWINDLING NOW.\nTYLER: Suddenly it’s like a wasteland, Doctor. All the injured are gone. All the dead dragged away.\nDOCTOR: It has the eerie quiet of a battlefield, yes.\nTYLER: Thank the Lord it’s all over.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nTYLER: There’s a carriage at six from Piccadilly. I need to be on it, if I want to be back in London tomorrow.\nDOCTOR: You’re leaving, Thomas Tyler?\nTYLER: I must first collect my luggage from Hurley Hall. Then I have a job to do.\nDOCTOR: Your report. Of course. Tempus fugit, and so must you.\nTYLER: I will tell the truth as best I can. Inasmuch as I am allowed...\nDOCTOR: What does that mean?\nTYLER: You will read my account in the paper. But it may be that I am obliged to compromise.\nDOCTOR: ‘Compromise’. I see.\nTYLER: You must understand, Doctor: society, the establishment... they will take a particular view of everything that has occurred here today.\nDOCTOR: And so you’re going to lie.\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 110\nTYLER: No, sir. I shall describe exactly how the yeomanry rode out, in order to quell a riotous assembly...\nDOCTOR: It only became riotous after they rode out. Mister Tyler, I beg you not to compromise your account. The people of Manchester were innocent.\nTYLER: As I said, Doctor: inasmuch as I am able.\nDOCTOR: Well, I look forward to reading it. Goodbye, Thomas Tyler.\nTYLER: Goodbye, Doctor.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 111\nROBERTS: (COMING OVER) Master William.. is it you?\nWILLIAM: Mister Roberts. You’re looking for Cathy.\nROBERTS: They said she was here, at the Infirmary. That she was in some bother...\nWILLIAM: I’ve seen her. She has come to some serious injury. Broken ribs, a broken arm. But the Sisters believe she will recover. Roberts, forgive me, [but —]\nROBERTS: Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord she’s alive. — And the babby...? The Sisters are looking after him, too?\nWILLIAM: (TRYING NOT TO BREAK DOWN, MOVING AWAY) You must... talk to the Sisters, Roberts. Never fear, I have seen that the account is settled. I.. I cannot stay here.\nROBERTS: Where are you going?\nWILLIAM: I had meant to return to the Field, but I’ve now heard it is all but emptied. So I must go back to Hurley Hall, to see my father.\nROBERTS: He wasn’t wounded too?\nWILLIAM: I have settled one account; I believe I must settle another.\nROBERTS: I don’t understand.\nWILLIAM: I’m sorry. So sorry. (WALKS QUICKLY AWAY)\nWILLIAM: CuT TO:\nWILLIAM: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 112\nWILLIAM: PAUSES, THEN CROSSES TO SPEAK WITH NYSSA AND TEGAN.\nSISTER: Are you still here? — Our work is better done unhindered.\nNYSSA: Please, Sister, we just want to see her.\nSISTER: She is sleeping. She is not to be disturbed.\nTEGAN: Then we’ll wait.\nSISTER: I should advise against it. The yeomanry will be here before very long, looking for the ringleaders of today’s riot. Agitatators. (HEAVY HINT) Radicals from out-of-town...\nTEGAN: Ohh, it’s like that, is it?\nNYSSA: Cathy’s got no-one but us. Please, Sister. We just want to see her, [and then we’ll be gone. ]\nROBERTS: Hello? — Hello? I’m looking for my daughter. Catherine Roberts?\nSISTER: Well, she has someone else now.\nNYSSA: Mister Roberts, yes. She’s sleeping.\nROBERTS: I met Master Hurley on the way in, he told me she was here. He seemed... very strange.\nNYSSA: Mister Roberts. There’s something you should know.\nROBERTS: Said he had settled one account, and now he had to settle another. — Who are you people?\nROBERTS: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL)\nNYSSA: Friends of Cathy’s.\nROBERTS: Page 113\nROBERTS: (SUSPICIOUS) Friends, are you? Her new friends, that have led\nROBERTS: her into this?\nTEGAN: Nyssa, we have to go.\nNYSSA: I have to explain.\nSISTER: Come with me, sir. I shall explain what has happened. These\nSISTER: people are just leaving.\nROBERTS: Thank you, Sister.\nNYSSA: We can’t just leave, Tegan!\nTEGAN: Nyssa, we have to! Didn’t you hear what he told us, about what\nTEGAN: William said?\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: What William said?\nTEGAN: That he had another account to settle?\nNYSSA: Yes, but —\nTEGAN: With his father, perhaps?\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: Oh no. He wouldn’t...!\nTEGAN: Come on!\nCROSS TO: AWAY.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 114\nWALTON: Captain Hurley! There you are, back at the barracks at last. Good man!\nHURLEY: Am I that, Captain Walton?\nWALTON: (DISMOUNTING) Of course! One of the heroes of the hour! Look how we routed them — a mere forty of us, arranged against... how many thousands?\nHURLEY: Fifteen fatalities. Six hundred and fifty-four casualties. The Doctor says.\nWALTON: Nonsense. — Who’s this doctor?\nHURLEY: What was it for? What was all that in aid of?\nWALTON: Protecting our wealth and our safety, man! Remember what happened on the Continent? Can’t let our own beloved land fall into the hands of radicals and revolutionaries!\nHURLEY: Was that... revolution? A march for loaves and votes?\nWALTON: Manchester has sent out a clear message to the country at large — we will not be bullied by the hoi-polloi! Now come — we’re repairing to the Star Tavern, to celebrate our success!\nHURLEY: No. I’m going home. I have nothing to celebrate.\nWALTON: Why, that’s not playing the game, Hurley. Your absence will be noted.\nHURLEY: Fifteen fatalities, sir. Six hundred and fifty-four casualties...!\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 115\nWALTON: Come now, Hurley. A few minor injuries. A few harsh lessons learned. (AS HURLEY TURNS) Hurley, you can’t go!\nHURLEY: I’m going home, sir. I’m going home right now!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 116\nCROSS TO: UP TO MEET THE DOCTOR.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Nyssa. Tegan. I was on my way to find you. How’s Cathy?\nNYSSA: Her father is with her.\nDOCTOR: Good.\nNYSSA: Doctor, have you seen William?\nDOCTOR: William? No.\nNYSSA: We thought he might pass by here, on his way to Hurley Hall.\nDOCTOR: As you see, there’s hardly anyone here now.\nTEGAN: Just smashed banners and signs. Trampled hats and bloodstains.\nDOCTOR: Oh, there’ll be a very efficient clean-up operation. Thomas Tyler will help whitewash the scene.\nNYSSA: 3: Who?\nDOCTOR: A journalist. A friend of the Hurleys. He’s on his way now, to Cheadle Hulme.\nTEGAN: Someone should put him right.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid the newspapers will tell lies about the massacre of St Peter’s Fields for years to come.\nTEGAN: Well, we’re on our way back to Hurley Hall. I’1l make him tell him the truth, don’t you worry.\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: It’s no good, Tegan. This is a fixed point in time.\nTEGAN: You always say that.\nDOCTOR: We can no more change the aftermath of these events than we could prevent the massacre itself. I’m afraid we should never have come here. If the TARDIS hadn’t suffered damage to its systems, if I’d known the precise date, I would never have allowed us to become involved.\nTEGAN: Yeah, well, we did become involved!\nDOCTOR: I understand how you feel, Tegan. I told Hurley, had I known he was with the yeomanry, I’d have done everything in my power to stop him. But it was too late then, of course.\nNYSSA: But would you, Doctor? Would you have tried to change history?\nDOCTOR: Probably not, no. I was — well, angry.\nTEGAN: I don’t blame you.\nNYSSA: I think we should get back to Hurley Hall.\nDOCTOR: To the TARDIS, yes.\nNYSSA: No, Doctor. Not the TARDIS. Not yet. We can still prevent something terrible from happening.\nDOCTOR: I beg your pardon?\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 118\nRAPIDLY: HOME ON DIRT TRACK. SLOWING, BLOCKED BY TYLER.\nWILLIAM: (CALLING, FROM CARRIAGE) Out of the way there! I said, out of the way!\nTYLER: William?\nWILLIAM: Thomas Tyler. It’s you.\nTYLER: Driving your own carriage, William? There’s fortuitous.\nWILLIAM: What?\nTYLER: I thought I’d be obliged to take Shanks’ pony all the way back to Hurley Hall, to collect my luggage. — I may ride with you,\nTYLER: of course?\nWILLIAM: I=\nTYLER: (CLIMBING UP) Good, good. (SETTLING) There’s a relief.\nTYLER: (JOLTED) Whoa there! What’s the hurry? I admit, I thought you fellows would still be in the Star. That’s where your father is, I take it...?\nWILLIAM: No. They told me at the barracks that he’d been seen returning home.\nTYLER: Odd.\nWILLIAM: I need to see him. At once...\nWILLIAM: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 119\nTYLER: Forgive me, William — but you seem rather strange. Distracted.\nWILLIAM: Is it any wonder?\nTYLER: The child. Of course. What a ghastly day.\nWILLIAM: He had done no wrong. He did not deserve to suffer.\nTYLER: It was the mother who took him into the field. Foolish girl! That’s the trouble with the poor. They have no notion of consequence. That is why they must look to their betters, to decide what’s best for them.\nWILLIAM: That could be my father speaking.\nTYLER: He is a grand man. And I shall tell him as much, when we arrive at Hurley Hall!\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR: Tegan, wait! (ALL STOP) Where are we going?\nTEGAN: We need horses, right? To get to Hurley Hall? So we’re going to the barracks.\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: But the soldiers...!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa’s right.\nTEGAN: The soldiers will all be at the Tavern. And even if they’re not — you’ve got the keys to the stables, remember? — Come on!\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 121\nTEGAN: THE HUSHED CALM OF HURLEY HALL. MRS HURLEY RUSHES TO GREET HIM,\nALL: DITHERY AND STARCHY IN HER FROCK.\nMRS HURLEY: My dear, you’re safe. I’ve been so worried!\nHURLEY: Have you?\nMRS HURLEY: Well, naturally. — Where’s William?\nHURLEY: If I’d have died in today’s melee you’d have copped for the whole lot. This house, the mill, the business, everything. You’d have been queen of all you survey. You’d never have had to suffer the sight of my face again.\nHURLEY: TICKS AND THE FIRE CRACKLES.\nMRS HURLEY: Why are you saying this? What’s happened?\nHURLEY: I am a monster, Elizabeth.\nMRS HURLEY: I should say you need a drink. I’1l fetch Dodson —\nHURLEY: No! Let me sit quietly. I feel sick to my stomach.\nMRS HURLEY: My dear, there’s mud on your boots. And is that blood on your sleeve? You’1ll leave it on the cushions...\nHURLEY: There is blood everywhere, Mrs Hurley. The streets of Manchester are swimming with it tonight. The civic buildings we have built to display our own magnificence will be stained with blood for a good long time. I shall close my eyes in bed tonight and still be able to see all the blood. I’11 still be able to smell it.\nMRS HURLEY: Where is William? — Something ghastly has happened, I know it...!\nMRS HURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 122\nHURLEY: Not to him. Not to us. Our world hasn’t changed.\nMRS HURLEY: Then... what? My dear?\nHURLEY: Cathy Roberts was at St Peter’s Field. With that child.\nMRS HURLEY: Her little brother...?!\nHURLEY: It’s dead, Elizabeth. The child was killed.\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 123\nSISTER: Good, you’re awake.\nCATHY: (WOOZY, IN BED) Sister. Is my friend Nyssa here? I should like to see her.\nSISTER: No. But your father is.\nROBERTS: (AT DOOR) Please. I just need to talk to her...\nSISTER: You mustn’t stay long. (EXITS BRISKLY)\nCATHY: Dad...?\nROBERTS: (COMING OVER) Cathy, love.\nCATHY: Oh, Dad...\nROBERTS: You're safe now. The Sisters will look after you. They’re good women.\nCATHY: It’s Peter, Dad. He’s gone... (WEEPS)\nROBERTS: I know, love. They told me. That little mite was too good for this rotten world. — Just you think about yourself now. You\nROBERTS: have to get better. Get strong again.\nCATHY: Oh Dad, what will I do...?\nROBERTS: Hush, now. — You should never have got involved. You should never have been out marching today. The likes of us... we have to keep our heads down. Know our place. See what happens when we don’t.\nROBERTS: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 124\nCATHY: No! Peter’s gone. But there are other Peters. Other children. They deserve better, I know they do!\nROBERTS: Enough, girl. Enough.\nCATHY: We have to go on fighting, for all the children. We must!\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 125\nWILLIAM: (OFF, CALLING, ANGRY) Father? — Father!!!\nMRS HURLEY: There’s William now.\nHURLEY: I heard.\nMRS HURLEY: Why all the noise?\nWILLIAM: (ARRIVING AT DRAWING-ROOM DOOR) Mother, I would speak with Father.\nMRS HURLEY: William? I know it has been a terrible day. But nonetheless: manners!\nTYLER: (ARRIVING BESIDE WILLIAM) Mrs Hurley?\nMRS HURLEY: Oh. The “reporter”.\nHURLEY: He’s all I need...!\nTYLER: (TO MRS HURLEY) I believe manners may be excused. It has been a trying day indeed. Nonetheless: all back safely.\nMRS HURLEY: Then that is something to be thankful for, at least. Our family is safe. From what I understand, we must be one of the few families in Manchester who hasn’t suffered a casualty of some sort today.\nWILLIAM: Is that so?\nTYLER: Perhaps we might all take a drink?\nTYLER: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 126\nWILLIAM: No. — Mother, there is something I must tell you.\nHURLEY: Your mother’s had enough upset for one day, boy.\nWILLIAM: (UNDETERRED) Mother — there is no way to prettify this, or to make it more palatable...\nMRS HURLEY: I think what your father means, my dear, is that we mustn’t discuss our feelings and thoughts in company. It isn’t polite.\nWILLIAM: Polite! Who cares about polite now?!\nHURLEY: Your mother does. Remember that.\nTYLER: I think what your parents are saying, William, is that they don’t wish to discuss today’s ructions in front of a gentleman of the press.\nHURLEY: You are correct, sir. You already have your story. I trust you are returning to London this evening in order to meet your deadline?\nTYLER: And a sorry tale I shall tell. Of revolutionaries and peasants. And how they had to be put down. Not unjustly. Not ferociously. But for their own good. For the good of the nation.\nMRS HURLEY: But that’s right, isn’t it, William? They became rowdy... unmanageable... Why, they brought the disaster upon themselves by becoming quite carried away.\nWILLIAM: Oh, I know who got “carried away”.\nMRS HURLEY: William, dear — sit down, beside your father. I should call Dodson to remove that horrid sword.\nWILLIAM: His sabre, yes. (SWOOPS TO PICK IT UP)\nHURLEY: Put that down, boy.\nHURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 127\nHURLEY: PASSENGER; TEGAN LEADING.\nNYSSA: (POINTING) There’s a militia cart on the drive!\nDOCTOR: William’s already here.\nTEGAN: Come on!\nTEGAN: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 128\nWILLIAM: Whose blood is this, Mother? On Father’s sword?\nMRS HURLEY: William, please. Let’s not dwell.\nHURLEY: I said, put it down, boy.\nWILLIAM: Do you want to tell her, Father? Or you, Tyler?\nTYLER: I... believe it’s time I departed.\nWILLIAM: No? Then it’s up to me.\nNYSSA: RUSH UP HALL.\nHURLEY: Who the devil...?\nWILLIAM: Don’t move, Father. Nor you, Tyler. We all three know what happened today.\nDOCTOR: As do we.\nWILLIAM: Doctor! Tegan...!\nTEGAN: William, give me the sword.\nWILLIAM: What? Why?\nTEGAN: (MARCHING FORWARD) Just give it!\nWILLIAM: Very well. (PASSES SWORD) I don’t understand...\nNYSSA: We were worried that someone might get hurt.\nNYSSA: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 129\nMRS HURLEY: Neither of my men has come to harm. We are indeed fortunate to come through a day like this quite unscathed.\nTEGAN: Hardly unscathed!\nNYSSA: William... have you told her?\nWILLIAM: We needn’t play this family drama out in front of Thomas Tyler. My father is right about that.\nTYLER: I thought I was good as family to you! I always was before.\nHURLEY: But today you are a.. What did you call yourself? A reporter! You have a duty to posterity, to history.\nDOCTOR: My thoughts exactly!\nTYLER: Nothing more you can say will influence me, Doctor. — I must get my things. Mister Hurley, may I borrow Dodson, and the Landau? I must catch the six o’clock, or I’1l be stuck here in the North.\nHURLEY: Be my guest, sir.\nDOCTOR: No, wait. Don’t turn your back on me, Thomas Tyler. When you’re writing your copy, I want you to remember. Remember the noise, and the panic. Remember the faces of those who were trampled on, or struck down with swords. Remember how the cavalry behaved today, and that nasty private militia assembled with such vicious intent!\nHURLEY: (LEAPING UP) Sir! Doctor! I cannot allow you to impugn the honour of my regiment, not in my own house!\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, sir. I was merely expressing my hope that Mister Tyler will listen to his conscience when he commits his words to posterity later tonight.\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 130\nTYLER: I’m sorry, Doctor. I must do the right thing.\nTEGAN: (CALLING AFTER) The right thing for who? For the rich? For your paymasters? For the ruling class?\nNYSSA: We’ll never convince him. Not now.\nDOCTOR: I’m a fool for even hoping.\nHURLEY: You’re a strange man, Doctor. You and your ‘companions’. Who are you? What are you...?\nMRS HURLEY: Leave them be, my dear. Let these awful strangers leave. I don’t want them in my home a moment longer.\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, Mrs Hurley. We’re leaving.\nNYSSA: Only not just yet!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, please.\nNYSSA: You’re all talking about history and posterity, but not one of you is talking about Cathy, and Peter.\nTEGAN: Too right.\nNYSSA: Peter, William. Do you not remember him...?\nWILLIAM: I carried his poor cold body to the infirmary. How could I not?\nTEGAN: But he was more than that to you, wasn’t he?\nWILLIAM: More than what? I don’t follow you.\nWILLIAM: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 131\nNYSSA: Cathy told me, William. How you used to play out, here in the grounds. How you used to make her laugh.\nWILLIAM: But that was years ago! What does that have to do with anything?\nHURLEY: Stupid boy, don’t you hear what she’s insinuating?\nWILLIAM: No, what?\nNYSSA: (FLUSTERED) That the child... was yours?\nMRS HURLEY: Merciful heavens.\nWILLIAM: No! I couldn’t possibly... No! Why would you think that of me? How could you think that of me?\nMRS HURLEY: The child wasn’t my son’s, you foolish girl. Do you think my darling boy would stoop so low?\nHURLEY: It were the progeny of some young radical, I expect. One of those who went round putting ideas in her head. But I took her back, after her stay down south. In my house. Despite the talk. I took her back — remember that!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, William. My young friends appear to have leaped to the wrong conclusion. — Nyssa, Tegan, we’re leaving.\nNYSSA: Even so.. Cathy still belonged to Hurley Hall, and so did her son.\nTEGAN: Even if the boy wasn’t directly related, he was one of your own!\nMRS HURLEY: I’ve never heard the like.\nMRS HURLEY: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 132\nWILLIAM: No, mother. They’re right. Cathy was one of us, and so was her child. We employed her. We employed all of her family. We were responsible — weren’t we, Father? The boy was one of our own.\nHURLEY: One of our own. — Yes. Yes, he was. (BEGINS TO WEEP)\nWILLIAM: I’m sorry, Father. But there’s the truth.\nHURLEY: What have I done? What will we do?\nWILLIAM: Peter’s gone. But there are other Peters. Other children. They deserve better, I know they do! — Isn’t that so, Tegan—\nMRS HURLEY: They’ve gone, all of them. Just now. While you were... (DISTASTE) . distracted.\nWILLIAM: What? Just... gone?\nCROSS TO: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 133\nCROSS TO: TREES IN THE BREEZE. UNDERGROWTH CRACKLES AS DOCTOR, NYSSA &\nTEGAN: MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE COPSE.\nDOCTOR: What you have to remember is that, as time travellers... sometimes, we witness terrible things. Things we never should.\nNYSSA: And you’re saying that these are fixed points, that we shouldn’t even visit?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I shouldn’t have put it that way. Yes, there are certain events that must proceed unimpeded. What I meant is, there will be consequences of today. Positive, as well as negative.\nTEGAN: I can’t see a bright side.\nDOCTOR: Today’s outrage marks are a major turning point in the history of the working class. I say that as a ‘posho’, of course. But nonetheless. Women like Cathy will be inspired to speak out. To push for reform. It’s the beginning of the campaign for universal suffrage!\nNYSSA: That’s something, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: Percy Shelley will write a poem about it.\nTEGAN: Oh great. A poem.\nDOCTOR: Words last longer than people do, Tegan. Even Time Lords. The words are the means by which any of it’s remembered. (QUOTING) “Rise, like lions after slumber/\nDOCTOR: In unvanquishable number!/\nDOCTOR: Shake your chains to earth like dew\nDOCTOR: Which in sleep had fallen on you:\nDOCTOR: Ye are many — they are few!”\nDOCTOR: Here we are. (PATS DOOR)\nDOCTOR: THE PETERLOO MASSACRE by Paul Magrs (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Yes, she seems to have repaired herself nicely.\nNYSSA: The child, though. Peter. It’s hard to consign everything to history and say, this is how it goes...\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: So am I. (SHE GOES INSIDE)\nTEGAN: Give her time, Doctor. She knows what it’s like, she’s\nTEGAN: travelled with you long enough. But she’s hurting, you know?\nDOCTOR: I know, Tegan.\nTEGAN: I was away for a while. But I still remember.
