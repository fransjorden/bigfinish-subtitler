Last time we crossed paths we were in Antarctica, with a communication dead zone on our side. Even then...\nACE: We were lucky to come out on top.\nDOCTOR: This time, we’re in the south of England.

He’s the king — all clever and impressive but very hands-off with the nitty-gritty. He sits at the back and sends everyone else rushing about, doing his dirty work — all those plans, strategies, tinkering. Sending wave after wave of pawns to die while he keeps his conscience clean.\nHEX: (UNSURE) It’s nothing like that. He helps people become the best they can be...\nNOBODY: The best they can be?!?

Ooh, ‘harmed him’. That’s a nice idea. Maybe later.\nDOCTOR: So I’m guessing you’re from my future, a contemporary of my older self?\nNOBODY: Oh yeah. You and me Doctor, we've battled through space, time, and half a dozen other dimensions. Broke a few of ‘’em, too. And the sacrifices you made trying to stop me — heartbreaking. Seriously. But I’m still ahead on points.\nDOCTOR: Would that be before or after you found yourself locked inside the Forge’s vaults? How will I do that, by the way?\nNOBODY: That’d be telling. The Forge were great though, weren’t they? I loved Nimrod. [NIMROD IMPRESSION] “Welcome to the Forge, Doctor!” Brilliant. But you had to go and kill him, didn’t you? You're like some intergalactic Elliot Ness Fun Police.\nDOCTOR: You’re too kind.\nNOBODY: I ran into them for the first time I was following you — you remember, in 1945? After I regenerated I needed to lay low for a bit, so I disguised my CORDIS as their catchphrase and hid in plain sight.\nDOCTOR: “For King and Country.” That was your ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 27\nNOBODY: Sometimes.\nDOCTOR: Very clever. But tell me, after all these encounters with my future self, how do you expect to ‘take care’ of the present me, here and now? Wouldn’t that create a paradox in your personal timeline?\nNOBODY: What, as if I’m some sort of space-time beholden, slave-to- science, matter-ape like you? I’m an unanchored, causal intervention in your universe, Doctor. “Please stop! With your every demented action, you jeopardize the whole of established reality!” — that’s what you said to me once.

This is the story of what happened to me, after the Doctor died.\nHEX: SCENE 17: EXT. FOREST PATH\nHEX: [FX: SLOW FADE UP. FOREST IN SPRING. ALIEN, BUT CLOSE TO EARTH. ‘BIRDS’ SINGING. BREEZE THROUGH TREES. TWO PEOPLE WALKING. ]\nHEX: AYL-SAN\nHEX: [WALKING] Alright, I admit it — this is nicer than the walk up to the church. Are the forests on Earth as peaceful as they are on Pelechan?\nEVELYN: [OUT OF BREATH. GOOD HUMOURED] Only because I’m not there, wheezing away, trying to keep up with you! I’m not as young as I used to be, Ayl-San.\nEVELYN: [FX: BOTH STOP]\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN Sorry, Aunty Evelyn. Are you alright? Link arms?\nEVELYN: No, I’ll be fine, thank you. [CATCHES BREATH] You really must learn the value of a good stroll, you know. March through life like that and you’1ll be out the other side [before —]\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN . before you’ve had a look around, I know.\nEVELYN: I’ve said that before, haven’t I?\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN [FRIENDLY] Just once or twice.\nEVELYN: [LAUGHS] I’m sorry. You’re young, dear. You charge about as much as you like, and don’t listen to an old has-been like me. I’m just jealous my charging-about days are over.\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN Has-been? You? As if!\nEVELYN: You're very kind.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: AYL-SAN\nDOCTOR WHO: Don’t give me that, you’re still one of the most formidable councilors on Pelechan. I was there when you chewed up Jeeph Haylis over the dam site.\nEVELYN: Well. He had it coming. Pompous ass.\nEVELYN: [FX: BIRD CALLS: MALE BIRD SINGS. FEMALE BIRD SINGS.

FEMALE BIRD. ]\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN That’s sweet.\nEVELYN: [FX: MALE BIRD. NO ANSWER. BEAT. REPEAT. ]\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN Oops, spoke too soon — sounds like the wedding’s off.\nEVELYN: Give her a moment. Perhaps she’ll decide he’s the right fellow after-all.\nEVELYN: [FX: MALE BIRD SINGS. BEAT. NO ANSWER. MALE BIRD SINGS.

I’m sorry, I could have sworn I heard...\nHEX: You did, yeah. But it’s gone now. I don’t think it’1l be coming back.\nEVELYN: Right... I see.. (SEEING HEX PROPERLY) Oh, but you’re white as a sheet! What happened? Is everything alright?\nHEX: No. No, it’s not, to be honest. Ace is gone. The Doctor's... [LOOKS AROUND] And this isn’t Kansas anymore, is it?\nEVELYN: You’re in shock. Why don’t we get you back to the house? I’11 get the fire going and make us a nice hot cup of tea. I’m Evelyn, by the way. Evelyn Rossiter.\nHEX: Hex.\nEVELYN: That’1ll be easy to remember.\nHEX: It’s short for Hector. Thomas Hector Schofield.\nEVELYN: Thomas Hector Schofield?

Heaven’s sake — brambles!\nEVELYN: (TO HEX) Please, don’t worry. It’s only Ayl-San. My ward.\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN [FX: BREAKS THROUGH] Aunty Evelyn, have you gone completely — [nuts? ]\nHEX: Hi.\nHEX: AYL-SAN\nHEX: [CONFUSION] Ah. Right. Hi.\nEVELYN: Ayl-San, this is Tommy Schofield.\nHEX: Hex.\nEVELYN: Sorry. Hex.\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN [QUIETLY TO EVELYN] What’s going on?\nEVELYN: Hex is.. a friend of the family. He’s coming home with us.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: INT. EVELYN’S HOUSE [FX: FADE UP. FIRE IN THE GRATE.

You said stop asking who he is, and what sort of ‘family friend’ turns up in the middle of a wood, so I stopped. [BEAT] Alright, fine. You be all serious. I’1l go for that walk up to the church after all. [STANDS]\nEVELYN: Thank you, dear.\nEVELYN: AYL-SAN [FRIENDLY] Back in a bit.\nEVELYN: [FX: DOOR]\nEVELYN: [DIFFICULT PAUSE]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 40\nEVELYN: Hex. You don’t have to talk if you’re not ready to. You don’t have to talk to me at all, really. But, well, I’m rather on the edge of my seat, I’m afraid. Has something happened? Is our Time Lord friend in trouble?\nHEX: (SAD) Did you know him well? The Doctor?\nEVELYN: Oh, we muddled along together for quite a while, me and him. You might not think it to look at me, but I was an explorer in time and space, just like you. [BEAT] What is it? Is it the Doctor? Hex, you’re frightening me.\nHEX: [TRAINING KICKING IN] I’m afraid there’s no easy way for me to tell you this...\nEVELYN: Oh no.\nHEX: I’m sorry. We tried everything we could think of to save him, but there was nothing we could do.\nEVELYN: . How?\nHEX: Defeating an all-powerful maniac. Saving the Earth. The stuff he was best at. Only this time, he didn’t make it out the other Side. [BEAT] Are you alright?\nEVELYN: (QUOTING DOCTOR) “I don’t always win, Evelyn.”\nHEX: Sorry?\nEVELYN: [GOES TO CABINET] The Doctor said that to me once, a long time ago. I was so angry with him, because I thought ‘Yes you do, you have to! It’s your job to win!’ [FX: CABINET OPENED, CLINK OF GLASSES & BOTTLE] As if the Doctor owed us all never-ending perfection, just because that’s what we’d come to expect., [FX:\nCABINET: CLOSED] But I didn’t ever — [expect] (CUT SHORT BY A\nDIZZY: MOMENT) Ohhh.\nDIZZY: [FX: GLASS FALLS TO WOODEN FLOOR — DOESN’T BREAK]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 41\nHEX: (JUMPING UP) Are you okay?\nEVELYN: (GETTING BEARINGS) I’m fine. Stood up too quickly, I expect.\nHEX: Here, let me pick that (PICKING UP) glass up for you. You’re sure you’re alright?\nEVELYN: (DISTANT) Look at that. It didn’t even break. Sometimes you’1l drop a glass and it’1ll smash into a hundred pieces, other times, not a mark. You never know, do you?\nHEX: That’s what I’m learning.\nEVELYN: I didn’t ever really think... Not the Doctor.\nHEX: I know.\nHEX: [FX: CLINK OF GLASS AGAINST BOTTLE]\nHEX: (SITTING) So what’s in the bottle?\nEVELYN: Something a little stronger than tea. [FX: SITS DOWN.

It’s no good.\nACE: What are you stopping for? Wake him up, Hex!\nHEX: It’s no good. He’s dead, Ace. The Doctor’s dead.\nHEX: [SCENE CONTINUES: ]\nACE: [DISBELIEF] No. He can’t be.\nOLDER: DOCTOR (SLIGHTLY OFF, APPROACHING FROM MEDICAL TENT) This time, Ace, I’m afraid that Mr Hex’s diagnosis is distressingly accurate.\nACE: & HEX (TURNING TOGETHER) Doctor?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 43\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21: INT. EVELYN’S HOUSE\nHEX: I look up and there he is. Another version of the Doctor. The same man, but older, just standing there. Before I can say anything Ace is on at him about changing what’s happened, finding a way to undo it. But this older Doctor, the way he’s looking down at our Doctor, our dead Doctor — I know. I just know.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 44\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: EXT. BESIDE CRATER\nOLDER: DOCTOR (SAD) Some things have to stand, Ace, and the death of a Time Lord is very much one of them.\nACE: What are you talking about? If you exist, then it isn’t meant to happen! You can correct a stray time-line, you’ve done that before.\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: There’s nothing stray about this. Beings like Nobody No One have a powerful effect on space-time. My timeline hasn’t been corrupted or changed. It’s been replaced.\nHEX: ‘Replaced?’ As in...?\nDOCTOR: As in, there’s no ‘correct’ alternative. This is what happened. This is what should’ve happened. This is what always happened. I died in my Seventh incarnation. On this spot, about three minutes ago.\nACE: (ANGRY DISBELIEF) Pants.\nHEX: Yeah, come on. Since when did anyone get one over on you? If there’s a way of sorting this, bending the rules, tweaking things a bit, then you’1l know it.\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: (SIGH) It’s so good to see you both again, I can’t tell you. And there I am, look: gone. Isn’t the universe a peculiar place? (THINKS) Perhaps it’s a blessing.\nACE: A blessing? How can it be a blessing? Think of all the people you won’t save by being dead!\nOLDER: DOCTOR (POINTEDLY) Think of the people I will.\nOLDER: [BEAT ]\nHEX: But you’re not gone, are you? Our Doctor’s gone. You’re still right here.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 45\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: For the moment. I am an extremely complicated space-time event, you know. Causality needs a few minutes to straighten itself out, adjust to the fact that the Doctor died today, not years in the future. When that happens, I expect I’11 simply disappear.\nACE: You don’t seem too bothered.\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: [ANGRY] Not bothered!? Of course I’m bothered! I’m dead! [IT\nHITS: HIM] I’m dead, and I’m only talking to you now because of a stray wrinkle in reality. I’m sorry, but some things are beyond my power and beyond my authority. This has happened. It must stand.\nHEX: You’re serious? This is it?\nOLDER: DOCTOR For me. But not for the two of you. For everything lost there’s always something new to be gained. Come on!\nHEX: Wait! We can’t leave you lying here!\nOLDER: DOCTOR UNIT’s undertakers are the best in the business, and they will be any minute. Which means we shouldn’t be.\nACE: Fine. Hex, grab that helmet thing and the computer it’s attached to from the Doctor's...\nHEX: . body.\nACE: Yeah. (BEAT) And put your jacket over him. I’1l round up the rest of the space tech from the tent.\nOLDER: DOCTOR Hurry up! [FX: WALKING AWAY] I know I used to say this a lot, but this time I really don’t have all day...\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23: INT. EVELYN’S HOUSE\nHEX: So we get to the TARDIS, our TARDIS, and the next thing, we’re off. [FX: DISTANT TARDIS DEMATERIALISATION] This older Doctor tells me to pack a bag of clothes. I’m not thinking too straight...\nEVELYN: The shock.\nHEX: Yeah, so off I go. When I get back, Ace is still trying to make him do something to change it all back, but he’s having none of it. Then we land, and the Doctor asks me to come outside with Hams\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: EXT. FOREST CLEARING [FX: TARDIS DOOR OPENS. HEX & DOCTOR EXIT]\nOLDER: DOCTOR Yes, this is it.\nHEX: Where are we?\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: [FX: CLOSES DOOR BEHIND] The planet Pelechan, local year 1871 AC. Billions of years before your time. Billions of years before your sun’s time. Up there, the universe is a baby, bright as a new pin.\nHEX: I don’t get it.\nOLDER: DOCTOR You've got friends here, Hex.\nHEX: Friends? How?\nOLDER: DOCTOR You’1l see. This planet could be a blank canvas for you, a whole new start. I can offer you that much.\nOLDER: [FX: ON ‘NEW’ THE DOCTOR’S VOICE BECOMES HOLLOW. THIS\nHOLLOWNESS: INCREASES SLOWLY THROUGHOUT... ]\nHEX: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nHEX: You're... turning transparent.\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: Time is reorganising itself. I’m fading out of existence. (REASSURING) Don’t worry, the process is quite painless. I won’t feel a thing...\nHEX: It’s getting worse.\nOLDER: DOCTOR (CONT) Fading into existence, you wouldn’t want to do that. Horrific reality burns. But this... isn’t so bad. I promise.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 48\nHEX: (UPSET) I should get Ace.\nDOCTOR: (KIND) Hex, listen to me. Before I go — there are things I want to say. Things I should have said, when I had the chance. It was wrong of me, not to tell you about your mother. I made a mistake. I’m sorry.\nHEX: It’s alright, Doctor. You don’t need to — [say anything]\nOLDER: DOCTOR\nOLDER: Yes I do. Sometimes we lie because we must, but sometimes we lie because we think we know what’s best for everyone else. An important distinction, and one that was lost on me for too many years.\nOLDER: [BEAT ]\nHEX: No. Whatever happened with us at the end, you’re the Doctor. You can’t die. You just can’t.\nOLDER: DOCTOR Oh, I’m afraid the fat lady’s already sailed, Mr Hex.\nHEX: What?\nOLDER: DOCTOR (SAD CHUCKLE) I mean, my death is a done deal. This is just the universe cottoning on.\nHEX: (HEARTBROKEN) Late for your own funeral.\nHEX: [FX: HOLLOWNESS INCREASES.

EVELYN’S HOUSE\nHEX: I don’t know if it was Ace or the TARDIS that decided to leave, and I don’t know why. But after that it was just me, on my own, standing in a forest on some strange planet. And that’s when you came along.\nEVELYN: (HEARTBROKEN) Poor Doctor. That wonderful man. (TRYING TO BE\nSTRONG: FOR HEX) Well. (FINISHES DRINK) I’m glad he brought you to Pelechan, Hex. It’s true what he said, you know. You do have friends here.\nHEX: Thanks. (BEAT) But.. I don’t get it. I mean, why? Of all the people the Doctor’s known on Earth, why would he bring me here to find you?\nEVELYN: I think he was trying to make good on past mistakes.\nHEX: How do you mean?\nEVELYN: Now the Doctor’s gone, I’m the only person left who can tell you about your mother.\nHEX: (SHOCKED) You knew my Mam? (REALISING) You were there.\nEVELYN: Yes, I was travelling with the Doctor when it happened. But it’s not a nice story. After all you’ve been through today...\nHEX: (SHARP) No. No more waiting. I need to hear it. I’ve needed to hear it all of my life.\nEVELYN: Yes. Yes, of course. [BIG SIGH] I first met your mother when the Doctor insisted we set the TARDIS down in South East London for — [REALISING] Oh, of all the ridiculous things. For a Chinese takeaway...\nHEX: (WRONG-FOOTED) A take-away?\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 51\nEVELYN: He was quite different back then. [SAD] Everything changes, doesn’t it? Nothing lasts forever. [BEAT] Oh, but listen to me. I’m sorry. Yes, we were walking back to the TARDIS and the Doctor was saying, I don’t know, something along the lines of “T have sat at table in the court...\nEVELYN: [FX: MERGE WITH AUDIO SAMPLE FROM PROJECT: TWILIGHT PART ONE,\nTRACK: 2 (0:34)]\nSIXTH: DOCTOR\nSIXTH: . the court of the great Kublai Khan, and tasted the mouthwatering pastries created by the master bakers of Borasdobon, and nothing, but nothing, beats the Peking Crispy Duck from the Slow Boat...\nSIXTH: [FX: SLOW FADE OUT]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT.

Don’t mention the time [ship-] (CORRECTING SELF) .. the you-know-what, I mean. I just thought, he’s a\nHEX: doctor, a man of science. He must be interested [in-]\nHEX: AYL-SAN You remember what I said to you, yes? The day after you first got here?\nHEX: Here we go.\nHEX: AYL-SAN\nHEX: I said: “Aunty Evelyn led an archeological expedition down to the Southern Ridge about five years ago. They found the wreckage of a huge —”\nHEX: (SOTTO) — spaceship —\nHEX: AYL-SAN “.. thousands of years old, crashed in the mountains.” I said: “Evelyn thinks it must have been some kind of —”\nHEX: (SOTTO) — time ship —\nHEX: AYL-SAN “., that we’re all descended from the crew of said —”\nHEX: (SOTTO) .. time ship, (NORMAL) yeah. Which would explain what English-speaking human beings are doing on such an old planet.\nHEX: AYL-SAN Then I said: “Just don’t talk to anyone about the (SOTTO) time ship. It’s a contentious religious matter.” (NORMAL) Is any of\nHEX: this ringing a bell? I can’t believe you went on at him about the (SOTTO) time ship.\nHEX: I didn’t go on at him about it. It’s just... this planet’s throwing me. In some ways it’s pretty modern, but in others it’s so primitive. You know they have leeches at the infirmary, don’t you? I’m not even kidding. Leeches. And this afternoon —\nHEX: AYL-SAN Watch your back, steam car.\nHEX: [FX: STEAM CAR CLANKS BY]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 55\nHEX: Cheers. (CONTINUING) .. This afternoon, I heard them saying something about ‘reading a soul into the hereafter.’ The staff, I mean. Not your vicars or Applins or anything —\nHEX: AYL-SAN (FROM NOWHERE) I heard you and Evelyn talking about your Mum.\nHEX: (THROWN) What?\nHEX: AYL-SAN\nHEX: I wasn’t eavesdropping. I just heard. I wanted to say I’m sorry. I’ll listen, if you ever want to talk about her or anything.\nHEX: Right. Thanks.\nHEX: AYL-SAN My Dad was an inventor, died when I was small. My Mum, she went up to play her part in the afterlife not long after.\nHEX: Oh hey, that must’ve been hard, having your folks pass away so close together.\nHEX: AYL-SAN My Mum’s not dead.\nHEX: What?\nHEX: AYL-SAN My Mum’s not dead. Look, you see the trees over there?\nHEX: Yeah...\nHEX: AYL-SAN Look past them, to the rocky hill behind. Up near the top there’s a church. You see it?\nHEX: No... oh wait, yeah. Gotcha.\nHEX: AYL-SAN That’s where we keep the afterlife.\nHEX: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: AYL-SAN The afterlife.\nHEX: I don’t have a clue what you’re on about.\nHEX: AYL-SAN I know.

(WALKING) To understand Pelechan, the thing you need to know is, no one really dies here.\nHEX: (WALKING) You reckon? Ayl-San, someone died in the infirmary just this afternoon. And Evelyn says life on this planet is pretty much identical to Earth — same gravity, atmosphere...\nHEX: AYL-SAN (WALKING) Evelyn doesn’t have faith.\nHEX: (WALKING) But you do?\nHEX: AYL-SAN (WALKING) Absolutely. My Mum’s the Story Speaker.\nHEX: (WALKING) Story Speaker? San, I’m lost.\nHEX: AYL-SAN\nHEX: (STOPPING) Alright, look. We have an afterlife — not one that’s up in the sky, like where Evelyn comes from — but one that’s right here, on Pelechan.\nHEX: So — that’s why “no one dies on Pelechan”?\nHEX: AYL-SAN Exactly.

It should cover the phone bill. If Lowry’s still famous. [BEAT] Is Lowry still famous...?\nHENRY: Ace, who are you?

I thought she was Fraud Squad, or something Similarly frightening.\nACE: Okay...\nHENRY: She knew my name, and she knew I’d spoken to you. She said if I ever saw you again, I should ‘strongly suggest’ you stop making such a fuss about your friend.\nACE: Did she now?\nHENRY: Yeah, and that ‘Your silence would be in the best interests of King and Country’.\nACE: Oh great.

Why would I give you duff art?\nHENRY: (MARVELLING AT HER WEIRDNESS) Do you know, before you walked through that door, I’d almost convinced myself you were a deranged art thief running from Interpol. Which would be funny if, well, if I wasn’t sure the truth’s going to turn out to be much weirder than that.\nACE: It’s harder than I thought it’d be.\nHENRY: What is?\nACE: Fitting in. Living day after day in the same temporal period. It’s like they’ve got rid of all the colours except yellow. There’s nothing wrong with yellow, I like yellow, but only seeing yellow all the time, yellow yellow yellow, I’m thinking — Where’s the red? Where’s the blue? Where’s everything else, you know? Give me velociraptor violet, Mondassian silver, anything, but if I see any more yellow I’m going to hurt somebody!\nHENRY: I understand maybe ten percent of what you’re talking about. But then, you know that already. (BEAT) Who are you, Ace?.\nACE: Short answer?

Nothing works. The Doctor’s dead.\nACE: What have you done with him?\nFABER: His body was interred in a secret vault within one of the great cathedrals.

Spots of rain started to fall. Warmer rain than anyone had been used to. The old rose garden in the centre of town had not bloomed for many years. Ethal Raid said as much to Greg-Oh Spivin at the well and both agreed that it had been many long years since a flower had grown there. Hyval Loritt walked lonely through the stony gorge, whatching his feet on the loose rocks, while overhead, two red eagles soared and swung in the heavy sky. The rainclouds waited like dark marble, and before long the thick heavy drops were patting down onto the land, warmed then than the frost beneath. Shal Hyvers at top horse dashed out from the back room to pull down her washing from the line and Greeg Spire was woken by the rain rap-tapping on the cover of his book as it layed over his face, bundled in three coats as he was and dreaming in his also-dreaming allotment, which waited for spring just as Greeg did, so there might be trowels and digging and planting and sitting out in the evening sun as slowly it would set.",

Already he had felt the first warm breaths of her approach in the breeze beyond the valley and now he thought of warmer times and of decades past, and of his wife Sulan, living still in the outside world and he thought - every day he thought - of the happy day when Sulan would make her journey from the land of Pelechan to the land of the Handervale and the two of them might be together again and together always, in this world of the afterlife. And Woodsman Faith wondered if Sulan’s Hedgeberry pie would taste as it had done all those years ago in the outside world, and with pride he anticipated preparing all the meals he had learned to cook for her since he came to Heather Rise, for he had not been able to cook or prepare a single morsel all the years they were together in the outside world.

Hendlefig the inventor threw tarpaulin sheets over his dream engine, lest the think workings become damp and sprite-circuit themselves. The wonderous motive machine had been the talk of many though there were those who thought is un-churchmanly that Hendlefig that he might consider the running of a machine on such fuel. The last of the tarpaulins, set, the inventor rushed into helping his neighbour Vichi Marsh. Vichi’s sheets rapped and flapped upon the line as she hurried to take them down, the inventor beginning to assist her working from the other end of the garden to get all inside before an mornings drying was all to waste. But in his hurry to help, the inventor thought nothing of the oil upon his hands nor the ink, until his own black handprints were shown back to him, covering those white sheets now in an ever-preserved hurry to help. Vichi Marsh let forth such a tirade then at the inventor, for though he was a good man and acted almost always from kindness and consideration for others, it was never-the- less the case that often such good intentions would backfire upon him, due to his natural clumsiness and a mind that was so often about something else, unless he should be in his workshop, where no other thought might find or touch him.",

Jaf knew the rain could only help his work, warmer than the frozen soil as it was, and happily he gave it it’s turn at softening the field for him, content to half-way dream of older days and his earlier life while bundled beneath the spread of the sychalan tree. How slowly might a tree grown in the afterlife, Jaf wondered, and how long might one live? Could one do ought but live in the Handervale? Or where the trees of the afterlif mortal there as a man might be on Pelechan? Jef knew th sychalan tree was at least three hundred summers old, as he had spent as many summers in its company, working his field.

I’m language with an avatar, just like you.\nNOBODY: Interesting. You’ve got five minutes.\nDOROTHY: Alright then, as you asked so nicely. A long time ago, on the planet Pelechan, there was a living story called the Handervale...\nDOROTHY: [FX: CROSSFADE TO: ]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. SPEAKER’S CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: [FX: PELECHAN CHURCH INTERIOR. SPEAKER WILDTRACK IN B/G. DOROTHY’S V/O IN THE F/G]\nDOROTHY: (V/O) .. To exist, the Handervale needed only a Story Speaker to speak it, and the Story Speaker spoke the Handervale every day of their life. Now, the people of Pelechan believed that the Handervale was an afterlife; and if a written account of a person was read to the Story Speaker by someone who really knew them and loved them, then that person would be recreated inside the Handervale, and live there forever.\nDOROTHY: [FX: FLASHBACK ‘WOOSH!’ SHARP CUT TO REPRISE FROM SCENE 30: ] AYL-SAN\nDOROTHY: [FX: TREATED, EG REVERSE ECHO] Rex Jeefers will be added to the Handervale, and will carry on living inside the story for as\nDOROTHY: long as there are story speakers to continue speaking it.\nDOROTHY: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT.

He’d been to Pelechan several times already, but on his last visit he’d collected that living story and taken it with him.\nDOROTHY: [FX: FLASHBACK ‘WOOSH!’ SHARP CUT TO THE TG TABLET — TREATED AS\nANOTHER: REPRISE, BUT IT ISN’T: ]\nTABLET: [FX: TREATED, EG REVERSE ECHO] In the year 2192 A.C., a stranger came to Pelechan and was given the Handervale to combat a great evil...\nTABLET: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nNOBODY: Very good, the Doctor became the Story Speaker. So?\nDOROTHY: On Earth, he trapped you inside the Handervale, inside his head. Then he locked himself inside a sarcophagus, so he’d never be disturbed.\nNOBODY: But I got out.\nDOROTHY: When Ace and his younger self revived him, the Older Doctor lost his concentration. And just for a moment, you saw that you weren’t in the real universe as you’d thought, but that you’d been tricked. That lapse in concentration was like a window opening, enabling you to escape.\nNOBODY: I saw the light. Hallelujah!\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 106\nDOROTHY: My Doctor died defeating you, and you were banished into a maze of internet noise. But the interesting thing is what the Older Doctor did next.\nNOBODY: Amaze me.\nDOROTHY: He sent Hex to live on Pelechan, hundreds of years before he came to take the Handervale away. Why do you suppose he did that? He sent Ace back to London, to the White Rabbit pub — where she met Henry Noone, and fell in love.\nNOBODY: Awww. Sweet.\nDOROTHY: With the Doctor, the little things that seem like accidents at the time, never really are. The space-time stamp, the TG Tablet — the Older Doctor planned for Ace to end up with them all along.\nDOROTHY: [FX: FLASHBACK ‘WOOSH!’ SHARP CUT TO REPRISE FROM SCENE 48: ]\nACE: [FX: TREATED, EG REVERSE ECHO] ‘Lime’! ‘Lime’ was the key to the thought lock!\nACE: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nDOROTHY: But try as she might, Ace couldn’t work out how the puzzle fitted together.

I can’t seem to stop saying that.\nFABER: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nDOROTHY: When the Doctor blasted you with sound that day, he exiled you, but not your CORDIS. You CORDIS was still around, still disguised as the repeated phrase ‘For King and Country’. That’s when Ace had her brainwave.\nNOBODY: One in twenty-odd years is something, I suppose.\nDOROTHY: A Time Lord can’t travel through just time by thinking about it, he needs a TARDIS. What if it were the same for a Word Lord? What if the manipulation of reality through language wasn’t an innate ability of the species, but a function of the CORDIS?\nNOBODY: Ooh, what if-?\nDOROTHY: So. Ace got Henry to write a long description of her...\nDOROTHY: [FX: FLASHBACK ‘WOOSH!’ SHARP CUT TO REPRISE FROM SCENE 49: ]\nACE: [FX: TREATED, EG REVERSE ECHO] Describe the woman I’1l be when\nACE: we’ve been together ages, on our tenth anniversary...\nACE: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 108\nDOROTHY: Using the space-time stamp, she posted that description to Hex on Pelechan, asking him to take it up to the Handervale church...\nDOROTHY: [FX: CROSSFADE TO: ]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. SPEAKER’S CHAMBER [FX: FADE UP. SPEAKER WILDTRACK TO SPEAKER'S FIRST LINE: ]\nDOROTHY: (V/O) .. and that’s exactly what he did.\nHEX: (HUSHED) Go on, San. Talk to her. It’1ll be alright.\nHEX: AYL-SAN (APPROACHING SPEAKER) Mum? It’s me. It’s Ayl-San. Mum, can you hear me?\nSPEAKER: . and all at once, the rain stopped, and the flowers in the old rose garden burst into bloom.\nHEX: (AWE) She knows you’re here.\nSPEAKER: And the skies cleared and the sun shone. Then the door of an old, forgotten cabin on the far side of the hill opened and, blinking and unaccustomed to the light, a woman stepped out.\nSPEAKER: AYL-SAN (DISBELIEF) Mum?\nSPEAKER: The woman had tears in her eyes, so moved was she by the voice she heard. And the woman said “Ayl-San?”\nSPEAKER: AYL-SAN Mum!\nSPEAKER: The woman beamed with joy at the sound of her daughter’s voice, Saying, “Ayl-San, it’s me, I can hear you.”\nSPEAKER: AYL-SAN (OVERWHELMED) Mum... Oh Mum. I need to.. I have a friend is with me. He has someone he needs to read into the story.\nSPEAKER: And the woman answered: “I know. The Handervale knows. The Herald leads to the Hidden Woman who leads to the Final Speaker. Their actions will end the world... to save the universe. (KIND) Tell your friend to read his account, San. Tell him your mother is listening.”\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 110\nHEX: [FX: UNFOLDING PAPER] OK, here goes.

He read the account to the Story Speaker, and into the Handervale. And in doing so, he created...\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT.

First thing was to work out how to make the\nCORDIS: project me a body like yours, so I could interact with the physical world. Course, I had to wait for time to catch up, for Ace to actually send the package to Hex before I could act. But she’s done that now, so — here I am.\nNOBODY: Question: Why? What’s the point?\nDOROTHY: You're forgetting, Ace heard everything that happened at the Forge crater. Including what you made that poor soldier say to make sure you won...\nDOROTHY: [FX: FLASHBACK ‘WOOSH!’ SHARP CUT TO REPRISE FROM SCENE 13: ]\nCORPORAL: [FX: TREATED, EG REVERSE ECHO] No One has the power of life and\nCORPORAL: death over the Doctor!\nCORPORAL: [FX: CUT BACK TO: ]\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 112\nDOROTHY: ‘No One’, spelled: N.O.O.N.E. When Henry wrote his account, he imagined me as his wife, which is why I’m Dorothy Noone, also spelled N.O.O.N.E. ‘No One’, ‘Noone’..? Can you see where I’m going with this, Word Lord?\nNOBODY: Keep talking.\nDOROTHY: “N.O.O.N.E has the power of life or death over the Doctor.” You made that rule. You’re No One, I’m Noone, but the spelling’s the same. So the point is — if the CORDIS gives you the power to bend reality and decide whether the Doctor is alive or dead, then it gives me the exact same power! And I say — the Doctor lives!\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT.

[BEAT] Poor old Henry Noone though, used for his name and left behind. You manipulated everyone who ever trusted you, didn’t you?\nDOROTHY: Ace made her choice. She sacrificed everything she could’ve had and everything she could’ve been for the Doctor. She even added a few words to what Henry had written, to make sure I’d go through with her plan. (SAD) I think Ace made her choice a long time ago.\nDOROTHY: [BEAT ]\nNOBODY: Yes, well. It’s been fascinating, but...

Perhaps you need to think a little more about what you’re teaching them.\nDOCTOR: If you have something to say, Evelyn...\nEVELYN: Hex told me how you... operate these days. The secrets, the lies, the schemes. His mother.\nDOCTOR: (SHARP) I didn’t come here for a lecture.\nEVELYN: (SHARP) Well, maybe it’s high time you got one anyway. Yes, sometimes difficult things need to be done — you and I know that better than most. But deceit? What good does that do? Other than to teach Ace and Hex that it’s alright to lie and to manipulate, so long as it all turns out alright in the end?\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 125\nDOCTOR: There are difficult things I must do, Evelyn. Me. Those things needn’t affect Ace and Hex.\nEVELYN: Oh, take your head out of the mechanics of the universe for five minutes and look what you’re doing to them!

I understand.\nNOBODY: What in the blue blazes is going on here?!?\nEVELYN: You haven’t killed anyone or anything, because you are inside the Handervale. This is the Handervale, and out there, I am speaking it.\nNOBODY: Impossible!\nDOCTOR: You were never inside that mobius chip, Nobody. Whoever made you think you were, they tricked you.\nNOBODY: What?\nDOCTOR: The chip was a red herring. It wasn’t the pendant around Captain Stillwell’s neck that drew you in and trapped you, it was the Handervale in his mind.\nNOBODY: The Great Living Story was not in that sick grunt’s mind.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 130\nDOCTOR: Oh yes it was. Whose ear was my older self whispering away into when we brought him out of the Forge crater all that time ago? Captain Stillwell’s. UNIT thought he was in a coma. But then, they wouldn’t know how to spot a Story Speaker, would they?\nEVELYN: The Doctor and Ace collected Captain Stillwell and brought him here, to Pelechan — where I agreed for the Handervale to be transferred from the Captain into me.\nNOBODY: Why?\nEVELYN: Because out there in the real world, I’m still lying on that lecture hall floor. There’s nothing anyone can do. I’m dying.\nNOBODY: But that means...\nDOCTOR: Yes, the Handervale is dying too. It’s been shrinking, quietly. Now there’s only this room left. A room with no doors.\nNOBODY: And you're here telepathically.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNOBODY: so you can get out.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNOBODY: But there’s no way out for me.\nDOCTOR: Not anymore.\nNOBODY: When Evelyn Rossiter dies, the story dies. I die.\nEVELYN: Yes.\nNOBODY: Why did you beg if you knew this, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 131\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t begging for everyone else’s lives, Nobody. I was begging for yours.\nEVELYN: We asked you to go. But you wouldn’t. “No one really dies on Pelechan” — that’s something they’re always saying round here.\nNOBODY: I’m going to die.\nDOCTOR: You left me no choice.\nDOCTOR: [FX: BUZZ OF FLICKERING LIGHTS]\nEVELYN: Doctor, the lights are failing. I think it’s time, you need to\nEVELYN: go.\nNOBODY: Wait! I have one last story, a little history lesson for you,, before the end. It’s not ‘Handervale’, it’s ‘Hand of All’. ‘All’ was one of the greatest Word Lords who ever lived, the founder of our society. The Hand of All was his finest creation, a living synthetic reality made from purest language. But the Hand of All didn’t just contain one little world, oh no — it was an entire universe. And inside that universe there were other pocket worlds, miniature Hands of All. What I’m saying, Doctor, is you may have trapped me in a place where reality is made entirely from words and speech, but how do you know I didn’t beat you to the punch? How do you know this isn’t simply one of those pocket worlds, and out there, you’ve spent decades travelling in an entire universe made only of words and sounds without ever realising?\nDOCTOR: I don’t. But then, you’re a Word Lord, you’1ll say anything.\nDOCTOR: [FX: BUZZ OF FLICKERING LIGHTS — TIME RUNNING OUT! ]\nEVELYN: Doctor, the lights! You have to go!\nDOCTOR: Goodbye, Evelyn. I shall miss you.\nEVELYN: Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you, for everything.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 132\nEVELYN: [V/O] (STRONG AND CLEAR) But the Doctor had already gone. As the lights grew faint around her, and the Word Lord paced the shrinking room in silence, Evelyn Rossiter sat quietly, without fear, thinking about her friend the Doctor. Her Doctor, with his bright coat and bravado, and all their wonderful adventures together, in time and space.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: EXT.

Was he better than our Doctor in the end, or a million times worse?\nACE: I don’t know.\nHEX: There was something he said, about telling lies because you think you know what’s best?\nACE: Right...\nHEX: Thing is, the whole time I was here, I was on at San to talk to her Mam, telling her how my mate Dan never got to make it up with his Dad, how she should seize the day and all that. I wanted her to be happy.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 134\nACE: So?\nHEX: I never had a mate called Dan. And that’s how it starts, isn’t it? I’m scared I’m getting like him, Ace. Like the Doctor.\nACE: Stay, Hex. If that’s what you want.\nHEX: You could have stayed in London, with your Henry Noone. But you didn’t. Why?

[FX: BEGIN TO FADE OUT, AS IF WE’RE PULLING AWAY] I’d like to say a few words about Evelyn — Professor Smythe, as I first knew her...\nDOCTOR: [FX: FADE TO SILENCE]\nDOCTOR: [MUSIC: CLOSING THEME ]\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 136\nAPPENDIX: WILDTRACKS 1: STORY SPEAKER WILDTRACK\nSPEAKER: (TRANCE-LIKE) In the fields behind the valley, Jaf Hast turned over the still-frozen soil and thought about getting home to Mar-Ha and the children that evening. Spots of rain started to fall. Warmer rain than anyone had been used to. The old rose garden in the centre of town had not bloomed for many years. Ethal Raid said as much to Greg-Oh Spivin at the well and both agreed that it had been many long years since a flower had grown there. Hyval Loritt walked lonely through the stony gorge, whatching his feet on the loose rocks, while overhead, two red eagles soared and swung in the heavy sky. The rainclouds waited like dark marble, and before long the thick heavy drops were patting down onto the land, warmed then than the frost beneath. Shal Hyvers at top horse dashed out from the back room to pull down her washing from the line and Greeg Spire was woken by the rain rap-tapping on the cover of his book as it layed over his face, bundled in three coats as he was and dreaming in his also-dreaming allotment, which waited for spring just as Greeg did, so there might be trowels and digging and planting and sitting out in the evening sun as slowly it would set.\nSPEAKER: On Heather Rise, Woodsman Faith chopped logs, oblivious to the rain, the chock chock of his axe giving an irregular heartbeat to the blood flow shhhh of downpour. Woodsman Faith had laided out food for the birds all winter and in anticipation for the scaled sparrows and four-winged nightingales to return from their winter migration, a sign that spring had truly taken the land in it warm and fertile hand. Already he had felt the first warm breaths of her approach in the breeze beyond the valley and now he thought of warmer times and of decades past, and of his wife Sulan, living still in the outside world and he thought - every day he thought - of the happy day when Sulan would make her journey from the land of Pelechan to the land of the Handervale and the two of them might be together again and together always, in this world of the afterlife. And Woodsman Faith wondered if Sulan’s Hedgeberry pie would taste as it had done all those years ago in the outside world, and with pride he anticipated preparing all the meals he had learned to cook for her since he came to Heather Rise, for he had not been able to cook or prepare a single morsel all the years they were together in the outside world. He imagined the surprise on her beautiful face, and noticed not a single drop of the rain as it beat down and soaked him through.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: Back in the valley, the first great rains of spring brought much hustle and bustle. Hendlefig the inventor threw tarpaulin sheets over his dream engine, lest the think workings become damp and sprite-circuit themselves. The wonderous motive machine had been the talk of many though there were those who thought is un-churchmanly that Hendlefig that he might consider the running of a machine on such fuel. The last of the tarpaulins, set, the inventor rushed into helping his neighbour Vichi Marsh. Vichi’s sheets rapped and flapped upon the line as she hurried to take them down, the inventor beginning to assist her working from the other end of the garden to get all inside before an mornings drying was all to waste. But in his hurry to help, the inventor thought nothing of the oil upon his hands nor the ink, until his own black handprints were shown back to him, covering those white sheets now in an ever-preserved hurry to help. Vichi Marsh let forth such a tirade then at the inventor, for though he was a good man and acted almost always from kindness and consideration for others, it was never-the- less the case that often such good intentions would backfire upon him, due to his natural clumsiness and a mind that was so often about something else, unless he should be in his workshop, where no other thought might find or touch him.\nDOCTOR WHO: Jaf Hast drank tea from his flask as he sheltered from the downpour under a large sychalan tree. Though far from water- safe, Jaf enjoyed the few fat drops and blown flurries that found him below his canopy and pushed his nose down to the lip of his cup, breathing in the warm steam from his hot drink. Jaf knew the rain could only help his work, warmer than the frozen soil as it was, and happily he gave it it’s turn at softening the field for him, content to half-way dream of older days and his earlier life while bundled beneath the spread of the sychalan tree. How slowly might a tree grown in the afterlife, Jaf wondered, and how long might one live? Could one do ought but live in the Handervale? Or where the trees of the afterlif mortal there as a man might be on Pelechan? Jef knew th sychalan tree was at least three hundred summers old, as he had spent as many summers in its company, working his field. Jef thought, upon some consideration, that yes, the tree had grown a small amount within that time.\nDOCTOR WHO: Henmal Rawlings, the baker, bustled two and fro with his two boys to drag back the sacks of flower from the yard. They had been cleaning the storeroom when the rain struck and now Henmal cursed and swore and berated the boys for the sacks getting when, this even though it had been no one’s idea but his own to lay out the sacks with the sky turning dark. And the boys knew better than to say as such when Henmal was in one of his tempers.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: 2: MARKET WILDTRACK\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A LARGE, BUSY VICTORIAN MARKET.

In science\nPRESENTER: news, Doctor Henrich Borgman presented findings of his research into the unanticipated global eclipse last year. According to Dr Borgman’s findings the ‘solar blink’ can be attributed to the quantum ‘ghost pull’ of a planet no longer in our solar system. I asked Doctor Borgman to tell me mor\nBORGMAN: (GERMAN)\nBORGMAN: Exploration of our solar system and historical records of planetary orbit, do give considerable credence to the notion of our solar system having once contained a further, tenth planet. This might sound remarkable, but we have strong evidence to suggest we once hand many more neighbours than today. The planet Theia, for instance, which crashed into Earth billions of years ago, creating our moon.\nPRESENTER: So could EHinstein’s spooky action at a distance really be responsible for the solar blink. Borgman is sure of it, but Professor Harris at NASA development remains unconvinced:\nHARRIS: (AMERICAN)\nHARRIS: The fact is, we simply have no idea what affected the sun last year. There are plenty of theories out there and NASA’s investigations are ongoing, but Dr Borgman is kinda making a big leap into the dark with this one...\nDOCTOR WHO: A DEATH IN THE FAMILY by Steven Hall (005) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: 7: PUB WILDTRACK 4\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR\nFOOTBALL: ...on a wet September afternoon for league champions Hull’s first match of the season against long time rivals Manchester United.\nFOOTBALL: (FX: COMMENTATOR INTERCUT WITH THE GAME THROUGHOUT & AS REQUIRED)\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR ONE It’s been a slow first half with neither team wanting to risk opening up with an all-out attack.\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR TWO Well that’s right, Tom. This one isn’t going down in the history books so far, is it? Bt that’s what we so often see\nFOOTBALL: with these two teams now. A sense of caution and both teams taking the time to feel each other out before committing.\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR ONE\nFOOTBALL: (EXCITEMENT) That’s Randle, takes up up the left side, over, to Hollis, who’s had a great season so far! Hollis tries to find Hannan on the end there...! But Brian Southwick was waiting.\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR TWO Yes. Nice play from Southwick. And a controversial signing too, after those bionic augmentation rumours.\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR ONE Now cleared up by the Football League, we should say.\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR TWO And once again, the ball comes back to Hull’s keeper Rossington. A Safe pair of hands, do you think, Mike?\nFOOTBALL: COMMENTATOR ONE\nFOOTBALL: Well, you would want to trust the feller with a nuclear power plant or anything, but it’s been a much improved performance this season from the Hull keeper.

The streams flowed though there were no people anymore to see them and a tree fell in the woods, unheard and unknown. The quite world continued like this, day and night, night and day, rain and shine, cloud and frost. And there were no people to see the stars twinkling over head and there were no people to run their hands through the fields of crops that now grew ragged and unattended, escaping their boundaries. And there were no people to tend to the old houses that began to fall into disrepair and become homes to the mice and the spiders for they had had no residents but the cold and the damp for so long. The quiet world waited, and the wind slowed, for almost is was as though that place held its breath, that dim awareness from beyond its boundaries told it that something was coming. And the forests grew fresh and tall with no people to cut at them or to see below their canopies where deer and the leaves fell to die and feed the leaves that would grow the next year, and then next over and over again. The cycle of silence and emptiness that now was the world again and again and over and over. And abandoned place this, lost and quite. Beautiful and quiet. Dead and quiet. Alive and quiet. Alive, alive, for it’s roots below the grown were fixed in the worlds that were spoken and the words fed the world and the world lived on and\nSTILLWELL: grew on is the quiet with no people there to see..."
