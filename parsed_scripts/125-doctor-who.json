And nothing elaborate either.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Draconian culture is very formal. Austerely elegant to the point of minimalist. Masked priests, ferocious warriors.

What are you doing in there?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY (THROUGH DOOR) You said we weren’t going to Draconia.\nDOCTOR: Maybe not.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY (THROUGH DOOR) Make your mind up.\nDOCTOR: I once played Sazou - that®’s a sort of Draconian chess - against the 15th Emperor. I9’m the only person to have ever beaten him - which was a bad move, because no-one beats the Emperor. The knack is to lose while displaying as much strategic skill as possible, so that he thinks he®’s the clever one by beating you.\nDOCTOR: You®’d think he®’d see through that, wouldn®’t you? But it’s all a matter of honour.\nDOCTOR: 18\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: The only thing that stopped them chopping my head off was the fact that I9’d just saved the entire planet from the ravages of a Great Space Plague.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY (THROUGH DOOR) Well, bully for you!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I thought so.

But if the co-ordinates are correct, he®’1l be a lot older by now. He was a bit of a wild card when I knew him, always upsetting the Nobles of the court with his new ideas, but that must have been sixty years ago.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Perhaps he®’s having a birthday party.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps.

I first visited your world at the time of the Great Plague and was received with considerable hospitality. The Emperor himself made me a Noble of his court. My life at his command.\nTOMBKEEPER: The Doctor? The Doctor? As one of the vigilants?\nDOCTOR: My deepest sympathies for your sad loss.

He’1ll be carrying the Emperor’s decree naming the successor to Draconia’s throne.\nPRINCE: The decree? (CHANGING TACK) Why then I must go and greet‘my oldest friend®’ before the vigil begins.\nDOCTOR: What is this vigil exactly?\nTOMBKEEPER: It is a period spent in silent contemplation of the late Emperor’s life.\nPRINCE: Three minutes would have sufficed, but no... three days!\nDOCTOR: I take it, your Highness, that you did not get on with your father.\nPRINCE: I take it, Doctor, that he held you in higher esteem.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t that flattering?

In my TARDIS. My private transport.

Already here?\nPRINCE: (SOTTO) Then where is he now?\nDOCTOR: (BUTTING IN) Of course, I can leave whenever I like. But that hardly seems respectful, does it? Not when I’ve come all this way. As for the Prefect’s murderer? I’d say he’s almost certainly still here in the tomb with us. And consequently, I’m concerned for my missing friend’s safety.\nPRINCE: Unless your friend is the assassin.\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. Don’t start lashing out. Charlotte is entirely innocent.\nTOMBKEEPER: Or he was following your instructions.\nDOCTOR: He’s a she actually. And the Emperor was my friend. Why would I want to murder his envoy?\nTOMBKEEPER: It’s a thin wineskin that divides sweet friendship from bitter\nTOMBKEEPER: hatred.\nDOCTOR: 52\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: Then we’ve plenty of suspects to choose from. But at the moment, we’ve only one decent clue: a shred of paper caught in the Prefect’s hand.\nPRINCE: What possible help can that be?\nDOCTOR: HereO... touch it. It has an odd texture. Almost clammy.\nPRINCE: Ow!\nDOCTOR: Careful.\nPRINCE: It nicked my finger. No matter.\nDOCTOR: Oh, dear. Paper cuts can be nasty, can’t they? Now let’s seed...

I was a novice at the young Emperor’s court.\nTOMBKEEPER: There were outsiders at court in those days. Honourable ambassadors from strange warm-blooded worlds across Draconia’s Empire. And the Doctor was there too. Everyone talked about him.

One of those killed the Prefect. Hence the shred of white paper in his hand. But the Sazou are only game pieces. Someone is playing them.\nPRINCE: A “White” Sazou? Doctor, you are an historic, but infrequent visitor to Draconia. Our rituals may not be clear to an outsider. So let me explain. Traditionally an Emperor is interred with a half set of Sazou pieces in his own colour. In my father’s case: Red. There are no White Sazou.\nPRINCE: MILA/CHARLEY Then what attacked Gomori and me?\nPRINCE: Attacked a superstitious peasant and a soft-skinned alien? Almost anything, I should think.\nGOMORI: It was a White warrior, Highness. Same as those things in there...\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY But white.\nDOCTOR: Highness, where’s your mother?\nPRINCE: She has duties of her own.\nDOCTOR: Surely her duties are here, overseeing your father’s obsequies. I want to speak to her.\nPRINCE: Speak to me.\nDOCTOR: Highness, I’m sure you understand our concern. You’ve already attacked your mother once in our presence.\nPRINCE: She’s not at your beck and call, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Then where is she?\nDOCTOR: 92\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY Doctor, he’s lying. Suppose he’s done away with her too.\nTOMBKEEPER: You were warned about speaking in the Emperor’s presence.\nPRINCE: The alien female was concerned for your safety, mother. Isn’t that touching?\nDOCTOR: Charlotte would apologise personally, Holiness, but she understands and respects your laws.\nTOMBKEEPER: Her contrition is acceptable... this time.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Holiness.\nTOMBKEEPER: There has been enough disruption. The vigil, the reason you were summoned here, must begin.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY (SOTTO) But surely...\nDOCTOR: (HISSES) Not now, Charlotte! (ALOUD) Forgive me, Holiness, but how can the vigil proceed when the all important decree of succession is still missing?\nTOMBKEEPER: The day bird, taking wing at night, circles in the dark till he sees the dawn.\nDOCTOR: Red sky in the morning, Draconia’s warning.\nTOMBKEEPER: The decree has been recovered. Here it is.\nDOCTOR: (DOESN’T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT) Amazing.\nDOCTOR: 93\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 94\nTOMBKEEPER: I found it myself amongst the late Prefect’s robes. I place it here... upon the Emperor’s breast. To be read once the vigil is complete.\nDOCTOR: I can hardly wait.\nTOMBKEEPER: So.. order is restored. Refreshment and ceremonial robes await you in the antechamber. Take one hundred moments to compose yourselves. Then your days of contemplative office will commence.\nTOMBKEEPER: 94\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: 36. EMPEROR’S CHAMBER (again\nTOMBKEEPER: Well, you old fool? I hope you’re satisfied. You summoned them and here they are: the Highest, the Lowest, the Bravest and the\nTOMBKEEPER: Wisest in your world. It might have been in your Empire, but no.. that’s long lost.\nTOMBKEEPER: And here’s the decree. (LAUGHS) Who’s arguing now, eh? Trying to pass over my son, were you? You should have known better.\nTOMBKEEPER: I’ve followed your orders to the last detail. Everything in ceremonial place. We must maintain appearances, mustn’t we? Keep up the show for the rabble. But it’s too late for you, poor old fellow. Heaven won’t help you now. Oh, no. Heaven is where you already are and it boils with rage!\nTOMBKEEPER: Enjoy your reign up here, with all the other Deathless Emperors!\nTOMBKEEPER: Who’s there?

Don’t keep them all for yourself.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY We could still leave.\nDOCTOR: Yes, we could. But we won’t.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY The rest of you could go. The Captain’s ship’s still docked.\nSOLDIER: One day, you’ll stop calling me that.\nSOLDIER: MILA/CHARLEY Gomori? Don’t you still want to go?\nGOMORI: What? And spend the rest of my days running from the Imperial sluggers? I may not have a tin spoon to my name, but I won’t skulk in shadows, thanks very much.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Sorry, I spoke. (BEAT) More tea anyone?\nDOCTOR: Where’s the Prince gone?\nSOLDIER: You don’t expect his Highness to spend time with the likes of usr\nDOCTOR: Nevertheless, he shouldn’t wander off. It’s not safe.\nSOLDIER: More likely he’s trying to get his hands on that decree.\nGOMORI: He’1l have to get past his mother first.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Does anyone really believe that’s the real thing?\nDOCTOR: 96\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: Seems very convenient, doesn’t it? But then what do I know? Perhaps I was wrong about the White Sazou. Perhaps it’s as much a visitor here as we are. If this is the Red Emperor’s tomb, am I right that there was once a White Emperor too?\nGOMORI: Oho, that goes back a bit.\nSOLDIER: The White? He was the first Emperor. A thousand years ago. He was a tyrant and a half. In his reign, he conquered fifty-two worlds. The scribes say the suns ran purple with blood.\nDOCTOR: And he’s here in his tomb in Draconian Heaven?\nSOLDIER: They all are, Doctor. Every last dead Emperor.\nDOCTOR: Fach with a half set of life-size paper Warriors in their own Imperial colours. Charley? You’re spilling your tea.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Sorry.., but that was what I saw. Out there, flying between the tombs. All white and changing shape as it flew.\nSOLDIER: That’s the one.\nGOMORI: And then inside... in the corridor.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY What does it want? Is it hunting?\nDOCTOR: It’s a gamepiece. It doesn’t think for itself. Someone else moves it on the gameboard.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY But how? And why make a set of toys so aggressive?\nGOMORI: It’s still here... the White Sazou. Somewhere in the tomb.\nDOCTOR: And we’d better do our best to find it.\nDOCTOR: 97\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: 38. EMPEROR’ S CHAMBER\nPRINCE: Who’s there?\nTOMBKEEPER: Caught you!\nPRINCE: (GASPS) Oh... Mother!\nTOMBKEEPER: Official capacity please.\nPRINCE: (SIGHS) Holiness.\nTOMBKEEPER: Better. Sneaking about again?\nPRINCE: No.\nTOMBKEEPER: You were after the decr\nPRINCE: If I don’t find out what it says, I shall go mad. Do you know? You do, don’t you?\nTOMBKEEPER: It cannot be read until the appropriate time.\nPRINCE: Oh, I know you, Mother. You’d never risk messing up your schemes. Just tell me I’1l be Emperor in three days time.\nTOMBKEEPER: I could not say... my son. (KNOWING) Imperial Highness.\nPRINCE: (CAUTIOUS) Good. But I still don’t like it. The decree lying there for anyone to pick up.\nTOMBKEEPER: Any threat will be dealt with.\nTOMBKEEPER: 98\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 99\nPRINCE: What do you mean?\nPRINCE: What’s that? Where is it? (WALKS TO DOOR) Is it out there?\nTOMBKEEPER: It’s history,\nTOMBKEEPER: my son. And it’s on your side.\nTOMBKEEPER: 09\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: 39. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A DOOR SLIDES OPEN. THE DOCTOR AND THE SOLDIER STEP THROUGH)\nSOLDIER: How do we find it? It must be lying low...\nDOCTOR: Or flying high... I don’t suppose it’s fussy. How small can a paper Sazou fold itself?\nSOLDIER: Small as you like... at a guess. But these ones are very special. Even when I was in service at the court...\nDOCTOR: I thought as much.\nSOLDIER: o,...they never had pieces like these. Sazou pieces were carved solid -— or Nobles dressed up.\nDOCTOR: Or those pocket-sized sets you could keep in your sleeve... because obviously there are no pockets on Draconia. But the quite exquisite life-size Sazou here must be sculpted of some sort of neuro-technologically responsive paper.\nSOLDIER: Directed by the player’s thoughts?\nDOCTOR: Whoever controls them has an eye to wiping the accursed reign of that great heretic, the Red Emperor, from history.\nSOLDIER: It’s the Priests. It’s always the same. Faith against the State, past against the present.\nSOLDIER: ct ct\nDOCTOR: And you left court life behind long ago.\nSOLDIER: Fortune pays my bills... or it doesn’t. These days, it’s every moment for itself.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t bother you at all, does it? And the answer to our problem’s obvious.\nDOCTOR: 100\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 101\nSOLDIER: Try me.\nDOCTOR: To catch a White Sazou...\nSOLDIER: o...we need a Red Sazou. (CHUCKLES GRIMLY) That’s sound logic, Doctor. But I doubt our hosts will agree.\nSOLDIER: 101\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: 40. TOMBKEEPER’S SANCTUM\nGOMORI: Charlotte? In here. Bit of peace.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Is it another shrine?\nGOMORI: Maybe. Look out there. Lights twinkling in the tombs... There weren’t lights before. I don’t like that. Do you think they’re watching?\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY What about your home? Tell me about that.\nGOMORI: Gomori... he’s lowest of the low, they reckon. Just shows how deep the honourable Nobles in their houses ever look. As far as lows are concerned, Gomori the fisher-catcher’s just paddling in the shallows.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY You said you weren’t really Gomori.\nGOMORI: Oi, hush. Keep it down, will you? Walls have eyes and ears, specially round here. I never liked walls anyway. You spend your life hiding, trying not to get noticed\"... and then this happens. I didn’t want this.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Getting noticed was just what I did want. But now®...\nGOMORI: I never left home before. Don’t suppose I’1l1 ever see home again.\nGOMORI: Other places, places over the horizon, were just stories.

Jumm the lamp-filler. That’s what I am!\nGOMORI: (FX: WE SPLASH INTO THE WATER, AND We’re IN THE HEAVY UNDERWATER WORLD)\nGOMORI: Others, the Lords, the villagers, all live in huts or fine houses. I live in a pond. Deep down in green water, that’s where I belong, catching fish for oil for lamps I can’t even afford to light.\nGOMORI: And they took me away from my world. What had I done? My only crime was being there!\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY It’s alright. We’1ll get you home, Jumm. I promise. I promise.\nGOMORI: 103\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 104\nGOMORI: And you, Charlotte? What about you?

(BEAT) Ready for this?\nSOLDIER: Ready.\nSOLDIER: They’ve formed up in ranks again. Careful!\nDOCTOR: No reaction yet.\nSOLDIER: One shred of white paper was enough to set them off before.\nDOCTOR: Yeso... Which one, do you think?\nSOLDIER: The Snake Warrior. It’s smaller - easier to move.\nDOCTOR: Without it falling apart? Look at simple, but so detailed. Even th Hard to know where to hold it.\nDOCTOR: he way it’s folded.

And lift.\nSOLDIER: (FX: THEY LIFT THE SAZOU. IT RUMPLES A LITTLE. THEY BOTH GRUNT AND LAUGH)\nDOCTOR: That fooled us.\nSOLDIER: Lighter than it looks. Just paper.\nDOCTOR: Deceptive at every level. Right. Towards me.\nSOLDIER: And back to me. They say you visited Draconia before. Mind that lantern.\nDOCTOR: Whoops®... Yes, I did. Sixty years ago.\nSOLDIER: They say it was youo... left a bit9... that had the Red\nSOLDIER: Emperor’s ear; that made him cut the world off from its own Empire; that brought Imperial Draconia to th dge.

If the Emperor hadn’t actedo... careful4... oops... do you think your world would\nDOCTOR: have survived at all?\nSOLDIER: It’s what they say. And down.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. There, no damage so far. But one warrior is enough, I think.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now, how are we going to manage this? Push it through the tomb until it picks up the scent of its enemy?\nDOCTOR: 106\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 107\nSOLDIER: No need, Doctor.

There’1ll be nothing left. (LAUGHS) Go on then. Finish each other off!\nDOCTOR: Gomori! Come out of there now.\nDOCTOR: VOCAL NOISES FROM GOMORI AS HE CLAMBERS THROUGH.\nTOMBKEEPER: Who released the Red Sazou from the Treasury?\nDOCTOR: The Captain and I took the liberty. It’s called fighting fire with fire.\nGOMORI: That White one was staring at me. If you hadn’t arrived...\nTOMBKEEPER: It would not have harmed me.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY I bet it wouldn’t.\nTOMBKEEPER: Where is the Soldier? And more importantly, where is his Highness the Prince?\nTOMBKEEPER: 112\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: 43. ANTECHAMBER\nPRINCE: I remember you. You were once a Captain in the Emperor’s bodyguard.\nSOLDIER: Yes, Highness.\nPRINCE: And your soldier of\nPRINCE: father before you4... but now you are a masterless fF fortune. How can that be?\nSOLDIER: My master is dead, Highness.\nPRINCE: You were banished - who knows why. Yet you still answered his summons.\nSOLDIER: IT still honour him.\nPRINCE: What’s honour to do with it? My father also summoned the Doctor, the serpent, who poisoned the Empire.... What does that tell us?\nSOLDIER: Saw?\nPRINCE: You are a dog. You run this way or that as ordered.\nPRINCE: In three days time, soldier, I’1ll be enthroned as Emperor and the stale old world will be burned away for ever. That’s when we begin again.\nPRINCE: But first, there’s work to do. Wheels must be turned, my position must be strengthened. Obstacles must be removed. After which, rewards will be great. Will you play a part in that... Captain?\nSOLDIER: Once honour®’s gone, Highness, it’s never bought back. But me? I’m cheap at the price. When do I start?\nSOLDIER: 113\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: 44. ANOTHER ANTECHAMBER\nDOCTOR: Well? What do you think?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY They’re a bit green.\nDOCTOR: I know. Green silk and bronze shoulder-plates are so last dynasty.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY As long as your knees hold out.\nDOCTOR: Dynastically speaking, my knees ar ven older. Three days though... that might be tough going. I fancy I might snooze a Ite le.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY With your eyes open, I’d suggest.\nDOCTOR: Passive wakefulness. It’s a trick I learned from a Sobekian shaman. But he was reptilian and it came naturally to him.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY That time already?\nDOCTOR: Remember what I said: keep calm, keep quiet...\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY And keep my eyes open. Right.\nDOCTOR: At least you can move about a bit. Here’s the TARDIS key. For emergencies only.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY\nDOCTOR: Somebody’s impatient.\nDOCTOR: 114\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: We’d better put in an appearance.

Wish me luck - quietly as you can.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Do I get to stay?\nDOCTOR: I doubt it. You’re already only here under sufferance. In case threaten to walk out.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Good luck, Doctor. Good luck... “Gomori.” Your Highness. (FROSTY BEAT) Where’s the Captain?\nTOMBKEEPER: The Highest, the Lowest, the Bravest and the Wisest... (BEAT) Where is the Wisest?\nDOCTOR: Erm, well... I was assuming that was me.\nTOMBKEEPER: Where is the Soldier?\nDOCTOR: Oh, well. If you say so. Does that mean I’m the Bravest?\nTOMBKEEPER: The vigil cannot proceed until he is present.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY (SOTTO) Should I go and look?\nTOMBKEEPER: Silence! Doubtless he will present himself.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY The Prince looks smug.\nDOCTOR: 116\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: Hmm?\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY Like someone who’s already won. Do you think he knows what’s in the decree?\nDOCTOR: Gomori? Are you alright? You look a little...\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Green?\nDOCTOR: Charlotte!\nGOMORI: It’s not funny. I don’t wear clothes like this. They feel all wrong.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Sorry.\nTOMBKEEPER: I shall fetch the Soldier myself. The rest of you remain here.\nPRINCE: Will this ordeal ever begin?\nDOCTOR: (MOVING AWAY) You’re eager to start, Highness. Where’s our friend, the Captain, do you think?\nPRINCE: Why ask me? I cannot account for him.\nGOMORI: (EMBARRASSED SOTTO) Charlotte, what are you doing? Charlotte!\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY I just want to take a peek at the decree, that’s all. Try and keep the others occupied.\nGOMORI: Be careful.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Won’t take a second.\nGOMORI: 117\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: She’d have you flayed for less.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY Then keep clear.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE EMPEROR’S CORPSE GROANS HORRIBLY.

FROM THE WALL COME THE STROKES OF A GREAT PEN)\nPRINCE: Shut him up! Shut him up!!\nGOMORI: Look at the wall! The writing!\nDOCTOR: These are his thoughts.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Please. My arm...\nGOMORI: What’s it say? (READING) ‘She... is.. lying.4’Who’s she?\nTOMBKEEPER: (RE-ENTERING) Stand away from the throne!\nPRINCE: The Emperor’s still alive! My father is—\nTOMBKEEPER: Let me deal with that. Stand aside.\nTOMBKEEPER: (SHE STRUGGLES WITH THE HAND) Hear me! Let her go! Let her go!!\nTOMBKEEPER: That’s better. Learn your place. You answer to me now.\nDOCTOR: Charley, are you hurt?\nGOMORI: Of course she’s hurt.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Yes. I am.\nGOMORI: 120\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 121\nPRINCE: My father is still alive.\nTOMBKEEPER: He is deathless. It’s the way of all Emperors. Even him.\nPRINCE: All of them? In all their tombs?\nTOMBKEEPER: My son, I warned you there were secrets, secrets the Priests have guarded for a thousand years. The Emperors cannot be lost. Their wisdom cannot be lost.\nDOCTOR: So you keep them alive? In their tombs in Imperial Heaven?\nPRINCE: Will that be my fate too?\nTOMBKEEPER: Oh my boy, my hatchling, you will restore the Empire that your father lost.\nPRINCE: How do you do it? How do you stop them from dying?\nGOMORI: This is horrible. I’m not staying here. They said there’d be ghouls.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Gomori... Jumm!\nDOCTOR: You ‘embalm’ your Emperors alive.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Oh, no. That smell. When we arrived, you thought it was embalming fluid.\nTOMBKEEPER: So now you all know.\nDOCTOR: All of us apart from the missing Captain.\nTOMBKEEPER: 121\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: We have to preserve them. Their wisdom cannot be lost. They are kept to be consulted.\nDOCTOR WHO: MILA/CHARLEY It’s repulsive. How can anyone be made to live forever? Trapped alive forever? They’d go mad.\nDOCTOR: They do have things to occupy them.\nTOMBKEEPER: Of course, they do.\nDOCTOR: The paper walls pick up memories and paint them alive.\nTOMBKEEPER: Oh, yes.\nDOCTOR: They play games. That’s why each Emperor has a half set of Sazou pieces in his tomb. They play against each other across eternity.\nPRINCE: Is that what you’ve planned for me?\nPRINCE: MILA/CHARLEY But they shouldn’t be attacking the living.\nDOCTOR: Forget your vigil. Let’s see what’s in that decree.\nDOCTOR: (FX: EMPEROR GROANS AND GRABS THE DOCTOR’S ARM. THE DOCTOR CRIES OUT)\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (IN PAIN) It’s alright.

The unholy serpent who laid Draconia’s ruin.\nDOCTOR: (OVER SPEAKERS) (SIGH) I’m sorry, old friend. You made me an honoured Noble of your court - my life at your command, etcetera, etcetera - but you didn’t do the wrong thing, you know. You had to save the world, whatever they say.\nTOMBKEEPER: It is the Doctor. Returned to threaten our order once again. He’s in your grasp.

Or did the Priests impose this on you without your consent?\nDOCTOR: And now you’re up here, interred in Imperial Heaven, do you want to continue? Could you bear that? Being eternally Deathless?\nDOCTOR: Or would you rather... ? (STOPS HIMSELF)\nDOCTOR: Well, you tell me.\nDOCTOR: But please, please don’t make me choose for you.\nDOCTOR: (HALF AMUSED) You want to win the match. (RELIEF) Do you know?

They’ve come for Him.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY They’ re right behind us!\nGOMORI: We couldn’t stop them!\nSOLDIER: Highness, find somewhere safe. The Emperor’s Chamber - that has solid walls.\nTOMBKEEPER: What nonsense. This is a game. No more than that. The Sazou are no threat to us.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY Where’s the Doctor?\nTOMBKEEPER: He’s with the Emperor, paying his respects. (CALLING) Come back here!\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY (DEPARTING) I have to warn him!\nTOMBKEEPER: SHE RUNS OFF.\nSOLDIER: Highness, you must remove to a place of safety.\nPRINCE: Absolutely.

White versions of the Red Sazou in the Treasury.\nDOCTOR: And were they aggressive?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY The Sazou? Isn’t that the point?\nDOCTOR: The minds that drive them are aggressive. The ancient Deathless Emperors of Draconia, trapped forever in their tombs, playing deadly games. Especially the First, the White Emperor, the most powerful and savage of all.\nDOCTOR: They want me, Charley. In revenge for what I did to their Empire.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOOR CLATTERS AS THE SOLDIER, GOMORI, THE PRINCE AND TOMBKEEPER STAGGER IN.

Those Warriors can cut through anything.\nDOCTOR: 142\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: It may buy us time.\nGOMORI: That’s it. Anything else?\nTOMBKEEPER: What difference can this make? We know what the Sazou are really after. They want him! The Doctor! He who trickled poison into the heart of the weakling Red Emperor.\nDOCTOR: Poison trickles. Emperor nods. Draconia crumbles. Serpent smiles.\nDOCTOR: (FX: GONG SOUNDS. THE WIND OF EMPERORS®’ MOANS. THE STROKES OF WRITING ON THE WALL BEGIN)\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY The walls again®... more writing.\nGOMORI: What’s it say? Me and words, we don’t get on that well.\nSOLDIER: It names the Doctor.\nSOLDIER: MILA/CHARLEY Over and over.\nDOCTOR: I thought it might do that.\nDOCTOR: And what about you, Holiness? And your insidious regime of Priests, condemning fifteen wizened Emperors to eternity like a set of mouldering books on a forgotten shelf.\nTOMBKEEPER: Be silent!\nDOCTOR: And there’ll be a sixteenth too when your son ascends the throne. He won’t escape.\nTOMBKEEPER: Silence!\nDOCTOR: 143\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: If he finds the lost decree of succession, of course.\nPRINCE: You think I don’t know her plans? But I’11 change all that.\nPRINCE: my reign, the Priests will answer to me!\nDOCTOR: I expect that’s what they all said.\nSOLDIER: It’s too quiet out there.\nGOMORI: There’s fifty two different sorts of quiet9... so they say. MILA/CHARLEY\nGOMORI: Doctor, there’s a spyhole here... in the door\nDOCTOR: Well, take a look then.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY\nDOCTOR: It’s difficult. Hang on. They’re right outsideo... the Sazouo ... waiting. The passage is full of them.\nGOMORI: Let’s have a look.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Why don’t they attack? You’d think they’d attack by now.\nDOCTOR: Because it’s the Red Emperor’s move.\nGOMORI: In\nGOMORI: That armour. There’s one like a siege engine. Vicious looking.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY\nGOMORI: But he can’t make a move. He doesn’t have the pieces to play.\nGOMORI: So why doesn’t the game just stop?\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Exactly.\nGOMORI: 144\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 145\nDOCTOR: An interesting conjecture.\nSOLDIER: Regrettably, Doctor, it’s in the rules. The player simply\nSOLDIER: chooses a set of substitute warriors.\nSOLDIER: MILA/CHARLEY Which means us, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I wonder§... Your Holiness?\nTOMBKEEPER: What now?\nDOCTOR: What powers the tombs?\nTOMBKEEPER: Why? What are you planning?\nPRINCE: There’s a central power house. The Temple of the Spilling Sun at the heart of the Necropolis.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Highness. If we disrupt the power, the other Emperors®’ influence over the Sazou will be broken. Then perhaps we can reason with them.\nTOMBKEEPER: Without power, all the Emperors will die.\nGOMORI: Mightn®’t that be a good thing?\nTOMBKEEPER: Keep such profanities to yourself, peasant. This predicament is easily resolved. Surrender the game. Hand the Doctor to the Emperors now.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY No!\nPRINCE: The power house is out of your reach.\nDOCTOR: 145\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: Is it? Captain, is your ship ready to fly? Could you take me?\nSOLDIER: We’d have to fight through the Sazou first.\nPRINCE: Captain, your ship is taking me back to Draconia.\nDOCTOR: And what will you do then?\nPRINCE: I’1l shoot the tombs out of the sky! Are you ready, Captain?\nDOCTOR: Captain? We need your help.\nPRINCE: We’11l soon deal with you.\nSOLDIER: Stand away, Highness...\nPRINCE: Lower your sword, soldier.\nSOLDIER: My lifeS’s already forfeit.

I was three years old, but he was aged and kind. He gave me a golden disc.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I remember. A gold sovereign with Charles I9’s head on it.\nSOLDIER: The Doctor had great influence. When the Plague struck, he demanded the antidote be given to Commoners as well as Nobles.\nDOCTOR: I like a good rumpus.\nSOLDIER: After that, the Emperor believed it was fate, not divine right, that set him on the Throne.\nDOCTOR: And you, Tegoya, became his bodyguard.\nSOLDIER: Twelve years I was at his sideo... and then he banished me, cast me out into the Burnt Desert on pain of death.

(SMOTHERED) Let me go!\nDOCTOR WHO: 167\nDOCTOR WHO: Paper Cuts by Marc Platt\nDOCTOR WHO: 771. EMPEROR’ S CHAMBER\nGOMORI: Charley? Are you hurt?\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY\nGOMORI: The power’s down. Anyone got a candle?\nGOMORI: Do you think the Doctor got through?\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY\nGOMORI: Page 168\nGOMORI: I don’t know. He can’t keep winning for ever.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Oh, you found a lamp.\nTOMBKEEPER: What are you smiling at, alien?\nGOMORI: We meant no disrespect, Holiness.\nTOMBKEEPER: The Doctor left the Empire in ruins before.\nTOMBKEEPER: The past, the future, all destroyed.\nTOMBKEEPER: MILA/CHARLEY But you killed...\nTOMBKEEPER: (SHOCKED) Husband?\nGOMORI: The Emperor... he’s alive!\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY Alive?

Oh, a passing Sazou, courtesy of the Dusk Blue Emperor, wrapped me up and flew me back. Times are changing for Draconia.\nGOMORI: Where’s the Captain?\nDOCTOR: (PAUSES) He was a true Noble. He gave his life to save me and his world. I don’t think I could have found a way to shut down that generator. That kind of courage is... humbling.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY But if the power’s off, why is the Emperor still alive?\nDOCTOR: That’s what I’m just checking. Hm, yes, quite a healthy heart beat.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY You mean... none of the emperors were on the brink of death when the Priest’s suspended them?\nDOCTOR: It would seem so.

A new emperor will-\nDOCTOR: Will have to wait!\nTOMBKEEPER: You have no right to-—\nDOCTOR: I have no right, no, but all fifteen Emperors of Draconia have rights. And at this precise moment, all of them are alive and very, very angry. All fifteen of them! Alive and waiting to be restored to power.\nTOMBKEEPER: What? But... no! All of them?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes! You wanted the past back so much, and now you’ve got\nDOCTOR: it.\nDOCTOR: Hello, old chap. How are you feeling?

And as for you...\nEMPERORS: Is any one paying attention? / What’s happened? / Where are my\nEMPERORS: servants? / How much longer must I endure this! etc...\nTOMBKEEPER: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: It’s all the restored Emperors in their tombs demanding your attention.\nTOMBKEEPER: No! Doctor, you serpent! What have you done to us now?!\nDOCTOR: So sorry. Wasn’t that the honourable thing to do?\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY (SOTTO) Doctor? Time to beat a hasty retreat?\nTOMBKEEPER: Majesties, you will be attended. Quiet. Please.\nDOCTOR: before our pasts catch up with us too!\nGOMORI: What’s gonna happen to me? Am I stuck here?\nDOCTOR: Well, you can come with us, if you like? We can drop you off.\nDOCTOR: MILA/CHARLEY (TAKEN ABACK) Oh...\nDOCTOR: Come along!\nTOMBKEEPER: This is impossible! Quiet!

And, well, the truth is... (SHE STOPS, FEELING A BIT BAD ABOUT THIS)\nGOMORI: What? What’s the matter?\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY He... he can’t really steer the TARDIS very well.\nGOMORI: Oh.\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY It could take ages to get you home. And I’d hate to think of your poor wife and... and hatchlings... well, worrying about you.\nGOMORI: Well, a little bit more worrying won’t hurt them. And anyway, I’ve no idea how long I’1ll be kept up here, with all that emperor stuff going on. It’s probably best if I come with you\nGOMORI: and the Doc—\nGOMORI: MILA/CHARLEY\nGOMORI: Gomori! The fact is, we may never get you home. And you wouldn’t want that, would you? And anyway, it’s.. well, as you can see, it’s a bit cramped in there.\nGOMORI: Oh... yeah...
