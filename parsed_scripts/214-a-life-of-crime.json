Thank you.\nMAYOR: (EXITING CHAPEL) A very tasteful service. Just what he’d have wanted.\nGLORIA: Nice to get a chance to say goodbye. It was all so sudden.\nMAYOR: (UNCOMFORTABLE) My sincere condolences, Miss Swannicker. Your... associate was one of our most... colourful guests.\nGLORIA: Thank you, Mr Mayor. There’s five hundred grotzits in the collection tray for... you know.\nMAYOR: Very kind, Madam. Very kind.\nGLORIA: If you’ll excuse me. Now everyone’s gone, I’d like a moment alone with the departed.\nMAYOR: Of course.\nGLORIA: WALKS UP STEPS INTO CHAPEL OF REST. WE FOLLOW MAYOR\nWALKING: OFF ALONG BEACH. HOVERBIKE PULLS UP.\nMAYOR: (CALLING) Hey! You there! You need a permit to ride those on the beach.\nMEL: (CALLING, OFF) Who says?\nMAYOR: I do.\nMEL: TURNS OFF ENGINE AND CLIMBS OFF. SHE STARTS WALKING OVER.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 4\nMEL: And who are you to tell people what they can and can’t do?\nMAYOR: I, young woman, am the Mayor of Ricosta. As such, fully versed in all bye-laws, regulations, fines and the enforcement thereof.\nMEL: (ARRIVING) Give me a break. I’ve only just arrived on the planet. (HANDING OVER A WAD OF CASH) Here. Will fifty credits cover it? It’s all I’ve got.\nMAYOR: (COUNTING MONEY) I may be able to overlook this matter for now. A new arrival? Might I enquire as to the nature of any business you intend to transact here?\nMEL: I’m looking for a Mr Lonnigan.\nMAYOR: You'll find him inside the Chapel of Rest.\nMEL: Chapel of Rest?\nMAYOR: Along the terrace.

You’re still wet behind the ears.\nNATHAN: Well. It’s the kind of crowd I’d be happy with at my funeral.\nGLORIA: Let’s hope that’s a long way off. (PATTING CASKET LID) Now you, the dear departed. You’re going on a long journey.\nGLORIA: PRESSES BUTTON, WHICH STARTS CONVEYOR BELT MOVING.\nGLORIA: There it goes. All the way down to Ricosta’s incineration and burials department. Or whatever else they want to do with the bodies.\nNATHAN: (URGENT) Gloria, can we talk about-\nGLORIA: Not now, Nathan. Get the hoverboat ready. I’m still hoping one more guest turns up.\nNATHAN: All right.

I’m looking for Lefty Lonnigan.\nGLORIA: Sorry, darling. You just missed him.\nMEL: We were supposed to have a rendezvous. Organised by a mutual friend of ours. I think I might be a bit late.\nGLORIA: No. I’m afraid he is. The ‘late’ Lefty Lonnigan.\nMEL: Oh. I see. Chapel of Rest. Sorry I missed him.\nGLORIA: We’ve all just said our fond farewells. Sent the coffin on its way to the hereafter. (WALKS OVER) And you are Miss Melanie Bush. Late to the funeral.\nMEL: How do you know who I am? Who are you?\nGLORIA: I know lots of things.

But it takes a while to filter through the system.\nSECRETARY: Indeed, sir.\nMAYOR: Prepare tax receipts for Miss Swannicker and the other donors. We require all charitable contributions to be on record. Above board and beyond reproach. That’s how we like to keep things.\nSECRETARY: Of course, sir. How was the funeral?\nMAYOR: So sad when we lose another of our long-standing — and most spendthrift - residents. Remind me, I need to work out the death duties and interment charges. (GOING INTO OFFICE) To pass on to the Lonnigan estate.\nMAYOR: GOES OFF INTO OFFICE. RIFLES PAPERS ON DESK.\nMAYOR: (OFF, IN OFFICE) What are these?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 8\nSECRETARY: (CALLING) Messages. From S.I.

I was hoping Mr Lonnigan would be able to help me.\nGLORIA: And why might you be needing help?\nMEL: Well, you see, I’m in rather a lot of trouble.\nGLORIA: Really? You don’t look the type.\nMEL: You didn’t say who you were.\nNATHAN: (CALLING, OFF AT HELM) Gloria! We’re almost there!\nMEL: ‘Gloria’... who?\nGLORIA: (CALLING) Mr Later! I believe the correct expression is ‘Secret Island Ahoy!’ (TO MEL) He’s the new boy. How did you get to Ricosta?\nMEL: My ship. The ‘Nosferatu Three’. They impounded it at customs. I couldn’t pay the landing tax.\nGLORIA: Of course. Though it’s not your ship really, is it? It’s the property of Mr Sabalom Glitz.\nMEL: You do know something, then? Maybe you can help me instead.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 10\nGLORIA: Oh, I’m sure I can. Once we’re safe on dry land.\nHOVERBOAT: ENGINES SLOW, THEN REV AS THEY PULL INTO DOCK.

SECRET ISLAND, DOCK\nHOVERBOAT: PULLS UP AT DOCK, THEN IDLES. HUM AS RAMP EXTENDS AND GLORIA AND MEL WALK ACROSS THROUGH FOLLOWING. DISTANT TROPICAL\nISLAND: CREATURES AND CHIRPING.\nGLORIA: This way, Mel! (WALKING) They go back a long, long way, dear old Lefty and your ship’s owner. A mutual arrangement of investment and support. He bought this island with the proceeds from their Iceworld job.\nMEL: (FOLLOWING) Iceworld? Oh. That’s where I met Glitz.\nGLORIA: I know. And Lefty had been following your career with interest, Melanie.\nMEL: Me? Then he must know we’re in deep trouble. Glitz always said he could rely on Lefty Lonnigan if ever we got into a really tight corner. He told me all about the retirement villa on Ricosta. He was planning on joining him one day. I liked the sound of the place — beaches, pools, fabulous restaurants.\nGLORIA: My my, he has been quite an influence, hasn’t he?\nMEL: But now we’re in real dire straits, Glitz has vanished. I thought he might have come here?\nGLORIA: No. No sign of him. Not even at his best friend’s funeral. Then again, ‘honour among thieves’ is a slippery commodity.\nMEL: Tell me about it! He’s run out and left me owing a lot of money to some very unsavoury types.\nMEL: THEY WALK ON ALONG A PATH. NATHAN HURRIES TO CATCH UP.\nNATHAN: Secret Island Ahoy, ladies.\nGLORIA: This is Nathan. Our pilot — among other things. He can show us the way inside.\nMEL: Impressive obelisk. What is it? Some kind of sculpture?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 12\nGLORIA: Lefty always had a liking for abstract art. Didn’t understand it. Just thought buying it made him look clever. Open it up will you, Nathan.\nNATHAN: Of course. Step this way.\nNATHAN: TAPS IN A CODE, ELECTRONIC HUM AND SCRAPING OF ROCK AS\nDOORS: OPEN UP.\nMEL: Oh, it’s not just a monument. It’s a building.\nGLORIA: Nothing gets past you, does it, Melanie?\nNATHAN: What’s the point of a secret island, if it doesn’t have a secret hideaway? This way, Miss Bush.\nNATHAN: THEY WALK INSIDE.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE\nMAYOR: IS ON THE PHONE TO SPEROVORE.\nMAYOR: S. I. Holdings have been extremely generous. I am the first to admit-\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX, VIA PHONE) Some might say too generous. We expect a return on our investments.\nMAYOR: But as you know, the economy here is very finely balanced.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) The scales are tipping away from your favour.\nMAYOR: I couldn’t have known the grotzit index would fall so low. The Ricostan dollar is just going through a very bad patch.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) We take financial responsibility very seriously. We had certain requirements when we offered the bail-out to your economy. Not all those requirements have been met.\nMAYOR: We should really have entered the common currency when we had the chance.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) You cannot profit from decisions not taken.\nMAYOR: No. Of course. You would know all about that.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) And we feel it is time we cut our losses - any further losses.\nMAYOR: We should have a new influx of residents very soon.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) Applications have been falling year on year for the past decade.\nMAYOR: I know. I know. But those that do come bring great wealth. I am introducing a regime of taxation, but-\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 14\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) Soon there will be no-one left.\nMAYOR: Then there are the tourists-\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) Our uses for them are... limited. You know we require the bio-signatures of your permanent residents for the process.\nMAYOR: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I really am grateful that you stepped in to support us in Ricosta’s hour of need. But I understood the investment strategy was always long-term-\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) That term is up.\nMAYOR: Please. A few more years-\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) We will see how the latest import tastes when our agent has prepared it. We are due in a board meeting. We always look forward to the menu on such occasions.\nMAYOR: I’m sure you’ll find it very agreeable. One of our most colourful residents.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (D) We will be in touch soon, with our final decision. Goodbye, Mr Mayor.\nMAYOR: A pleasure doing business. As always.\nPUTS: PHONE DOWN.\nMAYOR: (TERRIFIED) An absolute pleasure.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT.

GLORIA AND MEL DESCEND\nLAST: STEPS OUTSIDE AND ENTER.\nGLORIA: Sorry about all the steps, Mel.\nMEL: Not a problem.\nDOOR: SLIDES CLOSED BEHIND.\nGLORIA: This is what I wanted to show you.\nMEL: A conference room? Under an obelisk, on a tropical island.\nGLORIA: Sometimes, things are just what they appear to be. More of my associates will be joining us. But before all that, I should get you up to speed. With a little show and tell.\nMEL: ‘Show and tell’? What is this? School assembly? Listen, I don’t mean to sound rude, but who are you?\nGLORIA: All will become abundantly clear to you very, very soon. (WALKS OVER TO CONTROLS) All right. So here is the show.\nGLORIA: PRESSES BUTTONS. A SHUTTER OPENS.\nMEL: (GASP) The TARDIS. But... that means...\nGLORIA: Yes.\nMEL: Is he here? Can I see him?\nGLORIA: You'd better sit down. This might come as a bit of a shock. You came here to see Lefty Lonnigan. And I’m showing you a TARDIS. Let me fill you in on how the two are connected...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 16\nGLORIA: (VOICEOVER) The first Mr Lonnigan knew of this box, was when he picked it up on the security cameras outside his villa on the\nGLORIA: mainland. One week ago...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: EXT. RICOSTAN VILLA GROUNDS\nSEA: LAPPING, OFF. TARDIS MATERIALISES UNDER FOLLOWING, THEN OPENS. DOCTOR AND ACE STEP OUT. SEA IN DISTANCE, SEA BIRDS,\nCALLING: WAY OFF.\nACE: Nice. Should have brought a bucket and spade.\nDOCTOR: I doubt we’ll have time for sandcastles, Ace.\nACE: No. Looks like we got here too late. Someone’s already built a pretty impressive fortress.\nDOCTOR: Fortress. Luxury villa. One and the same on Ricosta.\nACE: That’s where we are, is it? Ricosta?\nACE: THEY START WALKING OVER SAND ONTO PAVED PATH UNDER FOLLOWING.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A retirement haven for a certain type of business person. Tropical climate. Untouched beaches. Fabulous cuisine. And no extradition treaties.\nACE: Right. That type of business person.\nDOCTOR: I wonder why the TARDIS brought us here? She’s normally quite select about who she mixes with.\nACE: Then again, you did steal her in the first place.\nDOCTOR: There is that. Shall we take a look around?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: EXT.

Balconies on every vista.\nACE: Yeah, but we just walked straight in. You’d think the criminal mind would be thinking a little more about security.\nLEFTY: (OVER P.A SYSTEM) Oh, I think about it. A lot. Hold it right there, you two. My boys will come and get ya.\nROBOT: SECURITY GUARDS CLANK TOWARDS THEM.\nACE: (CLOSE) Android sentries. Reckon you can knock them out with some sonic swizzling?\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Let’s keep that up our sleeves, shall we? Allow ourselves to be captured and taken straight to the top. Then we might discover who needs our help.\nACE: (ALOUD) So, who would live in a house like this? (CRIES OUT,\nGRABBED: )\nROBOTS: CLAMP THEM BOTH AND DRAG THEM OFF.\nDOCTOR: We’re about to find out. (GRABBED BY ROBOTS) Ow. Careful with the elbow! I’ve only got the two! (SHORT MUSIC TRANSITION TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT.

LEFTY WALKS\nTOWARDS: THEM — HALF HIS BODY IS CYBERNETIC, FOOTSTEPS ALTERNATES WITH ROBOTIC CLUNKS.\nLEFTY: So you’re saying you broke into my house to see if I need any help?\nDOCTOR: In a roundabout way.\nACE: Think of it as a complimentary security assessment. Well, now we've seen you’re quite capable of looking after yourself, (EDGES TOWARD DOOR) we should probably just be on our- [way] (GRABBED BY SECURITY ROBOT) Ow!\nDOCTOR: I think they’re insisting we stay.\nACE: What are you anyway? Some kind of cyborg?\nDOCTOR: (WARNING) Ace! (TO LEFTY) I’m sorry about my friend. She has an enquiring mind.\nLEFTY: Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of ‘Lefty Lonnigan’.\nDOCTOR: We haven’t, I’m afraid. (BEAT, REALISATION) Oh, I see. ‘Lefty’ because-\nACE: It’s only the left side of your body that’s still human.\nLEFTY: (MENACING) Yeah.\nLEFTY: CLUNKS FORWARD AS NATHAN APPROACHES OPEN DOOR AND KNOCKS.\nLEFTY: What is it?\nNATHAN: Mr Lonnigan?\nLEFTY: Oh yeah. The new boy. Come in, why don’t you. Norman, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 20\nNATHAN: (ENTERING) Nathan, sir. Nathan Later.\nACE: (CLOSE) Doctor? I’m thinking now’s the time to poke around up your sleeve...\nDOCTOR: FIDDLES INSIDE HIS JACKET.\nDOCTOR: (CLOSE) Already doing it, Ace.\nLEFTY: What should we do with these two, new boy?\nNATHAN: Well...\nACE: Tell you what, while you’re making your minds up-\nSONIC: SCREWDRIVER BUZZ. SENTRIES BEEP AND SPIN. SECURITY ALARMS TRIP.\nACE: We’1ll just be outside! (RUNS)\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Getting some air!

This way!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. VILLA GROUNDS\nALARMS: BLARING. DOCTOR AND ACE RUNNING ALONG PATHS THROUGHOUT.\nACE: Where’s the TARDIS gone? It should be right outside the gate!\nDOCTOR: It seems Lefty’s security droids may have acquired it.\nACE: Once a thief, always a thief.\nDOCTOR: In which case, we need to go back inside and find it.\nDOCTOR: LOTS OF SECURITY ROBOTS START CLANKING TOWARDS THEM.\nACE: I suppose we do. This way! There must be another way in. How\nACE: many of those robot things are there?\nDOCTOR: Too many! Ace! Back around here!\nDOCTOR: THEY RUN OFF AGAIN.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. LEFTY’S VILLA\nDOCTOR WHO: NATHAN AT CONTROLS.

This way!\nACE: (ON-SCREEN, RUNNING IN DISTANCE) Right behind you.\nRUNNING: FOOTSTEPS AND PURSUING ROBOTS CONTINUE ON SCREENS UNDER FOLLOWING.\nNATHAN: They’re outside.\nLEFTY: Then it’s time to prove your mettle, new boy.\nNATHAN: We’ve got cameras on them. They won’t get far.\nLEFTY: Good. They’d better not trample my azaleas.\nNATHAN: They’re heading past the pools. I’ve managed to get all the sentries back online. And I think I’ve filtered out whatever Signal came off that sonic weapon of his.\nNATHAN: PRESSES MORE SECURITY CONTROLS.\nLEFTY: Good. Very good. He can’t play that trick again.\nNATHAN: No. And I’m bringing in the spares from the perimeter too.\nLEFTY: Nice tech skills. Where did we hire you from again?\nNATHAN: I’ve been freelancing. I heard you looked after your own, Mr Lonnigan. Just want to do my bit to help. Earn my keep.\nLEFTY: We’ve a job lined up that you could be a good fit for. I’1ll see what my associates think when they arrive.\nNATHAN: What kind of job?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL)\nLEFTY: Let’s deal with these visitors first.\nNATHAN: There.

I don’t think we’ve got time for a jaccuzzi!\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) Just a moment!\nDOCTOR: STARTS USING SONIC SCREWDRIVER. WATER BUBBLES MORE FURIOUSLY.\nDOCTOR: Steam, Ace! It should give you some cover! Let’s abandon the villa for now. Get outside the grounds so we can catch our breath.\nACE: Right. (RUNS)\nACE: RUNS OFF TO FENCE AND STARTS CLIMBING. CLANKING SECURITY\nROBOTS: COME CLOSER AND WHIR IN CONFUSION.\nACE: (CALLING) Come on then!\nDOCTOR: I can’t. As soon as I move, the steam will disappear and the robots will head straight for you.

ACE DROPS OUTSIDE.\nACE: I’ll find whoever’s in charge of this place! Don’t worry Doctor. They can’t do this! (RUNS OFF)\nNATHAN: (VIA P.A.) We got one at least. Bring him inside. The boss wants to have a word.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE\nACE: THUMPS MAYOR'S DESK. PAPERS GO FLYING.\nACE: You've got to do something! You’re supposed to be the Mayor!\nMAYOR: I, young lady, do not have to do anything.\nACE: Don’t you believe me? You must know there’s a bunch of crooks living on your planet.\nMAYOR: GATHERS PAPERS TOGETHER AGAIN.\nMAYOR: It’s not a question of whether I believe you. I’m quite certain that what you describe may well have happened.\nACE: So? What are you gonna do about it?\nMAYOR: I? Um. Nothing.\nACE: Nothing?\nMAYOR: Nothing.\nACE: I’m gonna take this up a level then. Who’s your boss, fur-face?\nMAYOR: Young woman, I am the Lord Mayor of Ricosta. The highest authority.\nACE: (REALISATION) I get it. You’re in their pocket. Of course. If this place is some ‘Costa Del Crime’ planet, then it stands to reason the authorities are in on the action. What’s your cut?\nMAYOR: My ‘cut’?\nACE: You know. How much do the gangsters bung you to turn a blind eye? From the look of the villas out there, I’d say they’re probably selling you short.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 26\nMAYOR: I refute the accusation, young woman! I am extremely gratified that so many successful business men and women have seen fit to retire to Ricosta. Our economy reaps many benefits from such a diverse range of interests.\nACE: You’re raking it in and you don’t want to rock the boat. Fair enough. I’1l deal with it myself.\nMAYOR: Young woman!\nACE: SUDDENLY REACHES ACROSS DESK AND GRABS MAYOR.\nMAYOR: (GRABBED) Urrk!\nACE: (CLOSE, THREATENING) ‘Young woman’ me one more time, and you’1l be wearing that bushy tail of yours as a snood.\nMAYOR: A... a.. what?\nACE: A ‘snood’!\nMAYOR: K-kindly release me!\nACE: Your back end’s gonna feel a bit chillier. But, on the upside... you'll have invented the snood.\nMAYOR: Do not threaten me in my own office. (CALLING) Valla! Get\nMAYOR: Security!\nACE: No need! I’m going. (PUSHING HIM AWAY)\nACE: PUSHES THE MAYOR BACK IN HIS SEAT. THEN STORMS OUT, SLAMMING THE DOOR.\nMAYOR: What a disagreeable person!\nMAYOR: SOUNDS OF SCUFFLE OUTSIDE AS ACE PUSHES PAST SECRETARY.\nSECRETARY: (OFF) Oof!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 27\nACE: (OFF) Don’t bother trying to stop me!\nSECRETARY: (AT DOOR) Mr Mayor? What happened?\nMAYOR: If that young woman comes anywhere near these offices again... arrest her!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. LEFTY’S VILLA\nLEFTY: CLUNKS AROUND ROOM.\nLEFTY: What are we gonna do with you, then?\nDOCTOR: That’s rather up to you. Isn’t it time you told me? Why am I here?\nLEFTY: I haven’t the foggiest who you are.\nDOCTOR: My Ship has been homing in on someone in need of our help. I thought it was someone female. Given you’ve got me tied up, at gunpoint, I’d hazard a guess that it’s not you. (BEAT) Unless she’s taking a more holistic view of things...\nLEFTY: Help? You seem more like a hindrance to me.\nDOCTOR: How quickly we’ve got to know one another.\nLEFTY: I’m busy. I don’t have the patience for burglars. I’m waiting for some business partners to arrive on Ricosta. We’ve got a little job on.\nDOCTOR: I’m guessing it’s nothing innocent. Like a bathroom extension?\nLEFTY: Anyway. Why would I — Lefty Lonnigan, the most successful career criminal this sector’s ever known — why would I be asking some stranger for help?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. What happened, Mr Lonnigan? I mean, your prosthetics. The injuries must have been very severe.\nLEFTY: Things went wrong. On a job. I was lucky to end up in a state- of-the-art medi-facility. The Krytomp Bio-Infirmary. Out by Andromeda. In the Golden Dragon Nebula. Very swish. Do you know ah es\nDOCTOR: I’ve heard of its work. Pioneering reconstructive surgery.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 29\nLEFTY: Yeah, well. It’s all a long time ago now.\nDOCTOR: The folly of youth, eh?\nLEFTY: What are you? Some kind of intergalactic missionary?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been called worse.\nLEFTY: Hang on. You call yourself ‘The Doctor’?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nLEFTY: And that blue box. You called it a ship.\nDOCTOR: Not just any ship. The TARDIS.\nLEFTY: (CHUCKLES) Of course. I’m being so flamin’ slow! The old rascal. He can’t make it along himself, so he arranges some specialist assistance. You did come here to help me!\nDOCTOR: Now I think I’m being slow, Mr Lonnigan.\nLEFTY: CLUNKS OVER TOWARDS DOCTOR.\nLEFTY: The Doctor. The TARDIS. Tell me you remember Ravolox? Iceworld?

It looks like we won’t be needing that second option after all.\nMEL: I’ll just be inside.\nMEL: ENTERS TARDIS.\nNATHAN: I’d best close it down then. I’1l take the boat back. (WALKING OFF) Meet you over on the mainland.\nLEFTY: Do you think she’s gonna do it? Looks to me like she’1ll need some convincing.\nGLORIA: And I can convince her.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT. TARDIS\nTARDIS: B/G HUM. MEL STEPS TOWARDS CONTROLS.\nMEL: (TO SELF) I remember this. It’s been so long. Yet no time at all.\nGLORIA: ENTERS.\nGLORIA: Mel?\nMEL: (TESTING HER — MEL’S PRETTY MUCH CONVINCED IT’S A SHAM NOW) Do you remember what you said to me last time we were here?\nGLORIA: I.. er. The memory’s a bit fuzzy. I’m sure it’1ll all come back to me. In time.\nMEL: Days like crazy paving. I never thought I’d get to walk down that path again. But I always hoped I might. It’s been a strange time. A girl from Pease Pottage, travelling the universe with a ne’er-do-well like Sabalom Glitz.\nGLORIA: I imagine that gives you quite a different perspective on things.\nMEL: You can say that again.\nGLORIA: Will you do it?\nMEL: (FROM NOW ON, MEL’S PRETENDING SHE’S BEEN CONVINCED) If you’re asking me to do something, Doctor. Then I know it must be right. (BEAT) Of course. Of course I will.\nGLORIA: (BELIEVES SHE’S WON MEL ROUND) Mel! Welcome back!\nGLORIA: THEY HUG.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. VAULT\nDOCTOR WHO: HEARTBEAT AND PULSING GLOOPING B/G. ATOMON SLITHERS OVER TO CASKET.\nATOMON: (FX) You are still not ready. This is not right.\nDOCTOR: On that we agree.\nATOMON: (FX) I can prepare you for the process, nonetheless. Flavour is all in the preparation. (EFFORT) You are not what I expected.\nHEAVES: DOCTOR OUT OF CASKET AND SUSPENDS HIM AMONG GLOOPING CABLES.\nDOCTOR: (GETTING LIFTED OUT) Whereas you are strangely familiar. All those tentacles. All those mouths. A buzzing in my follicles. I’m trying to place the species.\nATOMON: (FX) I believed you were already familiar with my people.\nDOCTOR: IS SUSPENDED AMONG CABLES.\nDOCTOR: Ah. At last. Some feeling returning in my fingers and toes...\nATOMON: (FX) I am Sperovore.\nDOCTOR: Of course. And I’m not dead. Am I?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT.

(TAPPING KEYS) .. best left where they are for now.\nPHONE: TRILLS.\nMAYOR: (ANSWERING) Ah. Thank you for calling back. Yes, I’m looking at realising as many assets as possible. And liquidating them into my personal account- (BREAKS OFF, INTERRUPTED) Of course. I’m happy to hold.\nMAYOR: PRESSES INTERCOM.\nSECRETARY: (VIA INTERCOM) Yes sir?\nMAYOR: Valla? Tell the Foamasi representative they need a visa before making planet-fall. So we need to come to some arrangement - in cash. And the land tax on that mansion. Double it.\nSECRETARY: (VIA INTERCOM) Oh, and sir? There’s someone here to-\nDOOR: OPENS. NATHAN ENTERS.\nNATHAN: Sorry to interrupt. But if I wait for an appointment I could be here all day.\nMAYOR: Oh. You’re one of Mr Lonnigan’s people, aren’t you?\nNATHAN: That’s right. But I’m here off the books. I’ve come to see if we can do a bit of business together.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. VAULT\nDOCTOR WHO: PULSING, GLOOPING B/G AS BEFORE.\nATOMON: (FX) Do you feel death’s icy grip as yet?\nDOCTOR: Not in tip-top condition, I must admit. Paralysis, blurred vision... After-effects of some kind of neural anaesthetic.\nATOMON: (FX) So many species, I don’t always recognise the signs of termination. Let me take a closer look...\nATOMON: BUZZING OF PSYCHIC SCAN.\nDOCTOR: Agh! That’s enough poking around my mind. I’d rather you didn’t pry too closely.\nATOMON: (FX) Hmm. You won’t let me in. Perhaps I should hurry the process along.\nDOCTOR: No need for that! I’m sure I’1l expire any time now. I’m feeling quite peaky after all. What am I hanging in?\nDOCTOR: MOVES, CABLES SHAKE AND GLOOP.\nATOMON: (FX) My psycho-active cables. They allow the recently-departed to marinade in a brine of unfulfilled choices and aspirations. Adds to the piquancy. A delightful tang.\nDOCTOR: Food. Of course. Your people eat people. Or rather, while consuming a body, you feast on all its alternative futures.\nATOMON: (FX) Sperovores are not savages. We are gourmets. Our palates are attuned to only the finest flavours.\nDOCTOR: The finest flavours being all the hopes and dreams encompassed in a life.\nATOMON: (FX) You do know us.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: I’m starting to remember. I know you feed on potential.\nATOMON: (FX) It is so much more than that. And my brothers and sisters always share the feast.\nDOCTOR: That’s right. A hive mind. A race that devours the quantum possibilities of the soul.\nATOMON: (FX) How poetic. And you know what poetry makes me?\nDOCTOR: Do tell.\nATOMON: (FX) Hungry.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: EXT. OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\nDOORS: CLOSE. ACE WALKS DOWN STEPS.\nACE: It was about time someone got me out. Where’s the Doctor?\nNATHAN: Is that your way of saying thanks?\nACE: What?\nNATHAN: I posted bail. Me. Out of my own pocket. Lonnigan’s lot know nothing about this. Until now, they’d been happy to keep you locked up for as long as it took.\nACE: As long as what took?\nNATHAN: I’m going to show you. Call it a hunch. Call it stupidity. But I think you might be able to help me out.\nACE: What are you to Lefty Lonnigan, exactly? You’re not exactly sticking to the henchman rulebook.\nNATHAN: Oh, I’m nothing much to him. But he’s a person of special interest to me.\nACE: So he’s definitely not dead then.\nNATHAN: No. Not dead.\nACE: Good. I’d rather he was alive if I’m gonna punch him in his one good eye. For what he did to the Doctor.\nNATHAN: Cool it, for now. ‘Ace’, was it?\nACE: That’s my name. Don’t wear it out.\nNATHAN: Believe me, you’d just become very expendable to Lefty and his pals.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 53\nACE: I need to see my friend. If what I think has happened has happened... Well, he’1ll be in a state.\nNATHAN: (CAGY, HEDGING HIS BETS ON TRUSTING ACE) You wouldn’t believe what kind of state. No, Ace. Not here. My hovercar’s down the next street. I know where we’1ll find them.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: EXT. RICOSTA, MONTAGE OF LOCATIONS\nDOCTOR WHO: MONTAGE. HOVERCARS POWER UP AND ZOOM OFF. ‘ITALIAN JOB’-STYLE\nMONTAGE: MUSIC. LEFTY, GLORIA AND MEL’S VOICES IN ‘FOREGROUND’\nDESCRIBING: PLAN.\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) So this is how it’s gonna go down. Freddie and Frank. You’ll be taking the mini-hovers down the promenade.\nMINI: HOVER CARS ZOOMING OUT ALONG BUSY RICOSTAN STREET.\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) Charlie. You wait for the signal. Then get the container truck moving.\nBIG: CONTAINER STARTING UP. AND DRIVING OFF.\nMEL: (VOICEOVER) Where’s he taking that?\nGLORIA: (VOICEOVER) We’1ll draw too much attention driving that up to the Bank. That’s where our mini-hovers come in. We’ve rigged a jammer broadcast for the traffic controls. Every traffic- light and navcom in Ricosta central. Just get in position...\nTRAFFIC: JAMS. HONKING. MINI HOVER CARS PULLING UP.\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) Then Freddie and Frank activate their gizmos.\nJAMMING: SIGNAL STARTS BEEPING. MORE TRAFFIC NOISE, CAR DOORS SLAM. ANGRY SHOUTS.\nWILDTRACK RICOSTANS: Oi!/ Out the way!/ What’s the hold-up?\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) The signal goes out, and we snarl up the whole ci — all apart from Main Street.\nGLORIA: (VOICEOVER) So the container can get though.\nCONTAINER: LORRY DRIVES DOWN EMPTY STREET\nGLORIA: (VOICEOVER) With us lot sitting in the back, and our TARDIS.\nCROSS TO: up\nCROSS TO: ty\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT.

The Security Centre, right over the Vault of the Bank of Ricosta.\nGLORIA: Any word from the new boy?\nLEFTY: Never made it back. I’1l just have to take care of this bit myself.\nSHUTTER: DOOR OF CONTAINER PULLED OPEN.\nLEFTY: Me, Tren and Gart can deal with ground floor security. Given my.. particular advantage.\nMEL: Being dead.\nGLORIA: Yes, that. It’1ll send the scanners into a tizzy. Force a self- diagnostic.\nLEFTY: And that’s our window. (GETTING UP) Come on you lot.\nLEFTY: CLUNKS OUT, OTHERS FOLLOW.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: EXT.

Got those canisters?\nTHUGS: Yes, boss.\nLEFTY: Right then. (STRIDING FORWARDS) A dead man walked into a bank...\nBANK: DOORS SWISH OPEN. LEFTY AND TWO THUGS WALK IN. DOORS CLOSE. CANISTERS THROWN INSIDE. HISS OF GAS, CRIES OF ALARM, WITHIN.\nGUARDS: (INSIDE BANK) Stop!/ Don’t move!/ No, wait!/ Gas!!!/ Aaaargh!/\nMEL: They’re not hurting them, are they?\nGLORIA: Knockout gas. Harmless. They’1ll just get bruises when they hit the floor.\nGUARDS: FALLING INSIDE. BANK ALARMS START.\nGLORIA: (WALKING FORWARD) That’s our cue.\nMEL: But the alarms-\nGLORIA: No-one gets through the traffic, remember? And by the time they do, we'll be away. (CALLING) Charlie!

Fifth floor!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. NATHAN’S HOVERCAR, RICOSTAN STREETS\nTRAFFIC: JAM. JAMMED VEHICLES HONKING.\nACE: Traffic’s bad.\nNATHAN: Yeah. Ricosta normally prides itself on running like clockwork. That way the toll charges keep rolling in.\nNATHAN: OPENS HOVERCAR DOORS.\nACE: You reckon it might be quicker to walk?\nNATHAN: Yeah. If the traffic’s stopped. That means they’ve started.\nNATHAN: THEY GET OUT.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: EXT. RICOSTAN STREETS (CONTINUOUS)\nTRAFFIC: JAM ALL AROUND.\nACE: Who’s started what?\nNATHAN: You’ll see. Come on. We need to hurry.\nNATHAN: ACE AND NATHAN JOG ALONG THROUGH TRAFFIC JAM THROUGHOUT FOLLOWING.\nACE: Where to? Why? Your handsome mug might let you play the man of mystery card with some people. But not me. What are you doing?\nNATHAN: I’m doing my job.\nACE: I thought you were a freelance criminal.\nNATHAN: No, Ace. Time to come clean. I’m a policeman.\nACE: Gordon Bennett.\nNATHAN: No. Nathan Later. Undercover. And I want to nail Lefty Lonnigan. Because he’s made my life a misery.\nNATHAN: THEY RUN ON, TRAFFIC JAM NOISES FADE.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT.

While Red here is working on the computers with... ‘The Doctor’-\nMEL: (VOICEOVER) The name’s Melanie!\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) While you two work on the computers, I’1l have knocked out the guards. Charlie brings that TARDIS inside on the hovercart and we’ll be waiting for you to peel back Vault security.\nCOMPUTERS: BEEPING. ALARMS STOP.\nMEL: That’s better. I can hear myself think.\nGLORIA: Mel? How’s it coming over there?\nMEL: I’m in. Switching off all the cameras now.\nMEL: CLICKS. MEL CARRIES ON WORKING. COMPUTERS BEEPING IN RESPONSE.\nMEL: And vault combination... reset. On the inner and outer locks. To something a little easier.\nGLORIA: Ten thousand possibilities on each. You should crack it in no time at all.\nMEL: Well, give me half an hour.\nGLORIA: Time Lord. You can have whatever time you like! Now, I just have to wipe the security footage, clear memory buffers, and reset the system.\nCOMPUTERS: BEEPING AND RESETTING.\nGLORIA: It’s like we were never here. Nothing for the Ricostan police to worry about at all...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 60\nMEL: All done. I’m just calling the elevator.\nUNDER: FOLLOWING, LIFT ARRIVES AND OPENS. MEL AND GLORIA RUN INTO IT. DOORS CLOSE.\nLEFTY: (VOICEOVER) And then when you’ve finished, we can all meet-\nMEL: (VOICEOVER) Down in the basement-\nGLORIA: (VOICEOVER) Outside the Vault.\nLIFT: PINGS THROUGH FLOORS...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. RICOSTAN BANK VAULT\nLIFT: PINGS ON ARRIVAL AND OPENS. MEL STEPS OUT.\nMEL: So that’s everything?\nLEFTY: Everything. All that’s left to do is break inside. Inner and outer doors. Then we take out the goodies and load up our blue holdall.\nGLORIA: Ready to do your safe-cracking stuff, Mel?\nMEL: Ready. ‘Doctor’.\nMEL: STEPS FORWARD AND ACTIVATES VAULT LOCK.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. RICOSTAN STREET\nTRAFFIC: JAM, FAR OFF. ACE AND NATHAN HURRY ALONG EMPTY STREET.\nACE: How come you’ve made it personal?\nNATHAN: My dad. He was a cop like me. And he never caught him. It drove him mad. Lefty always stayed two steps ahead. Dad took it out on us. One of the many things Lefty Lonnigan stole was my childhood.\nACE: How’d he end up the full Long John Silver? What happened to him?\nNATHAN: No-one knows for sure. Lefty came out of nowhere. All it said\nNATHAN: in the hospital records was some explosion. Must’ve been a job gone wrong. Over twenty years back. Him and one Sabalom Glitz\nNATHAN: struck up quite a partnership.\nACE: Hang on.. Glitz?! (BEAT) Run that by me again?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. VAULT\nDOCTOR: WRIGGLING IN GLOOPY TUBES.\nATOMON: (FX) What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) If I’m not dead, I’m certainly not going to lie down.\nATOMON: (FX) You cannot escape. You may not be deceased now. But you very soon will be. I have requested authorisation for an intervention.\nDOCTOR: Authorisation? Oh yes, from your parent company.\nATOMON: (FX) Think of it as.. an accounting error, Mr Lonnigan. One that will very soon be corrected.\nDOCTOR: (STOPS STRUGGLING) I’m sorry. What did you call me?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: EXT. OUTSIDE RICOSTAN BANK\nDOCTOR WHO: ACE AND NATHAN WALK THROUGH QUIET STREET.\nNATHAN: Lonnigan and Glitz. Partners in crime. Ever since they were laid up in the same hospital ward.\nACE: Glitz always finds his feet.\nNATHAN: You know him?\nACE: He hung around a place I worked. Like a bad smell. (STOPPING) It’s deserted. Is the street closed?\nNATHAN: That was the idea. Everyone’s navcom’s been told there are roadworks. Only there aren’t. Here’s the bank.\nNATHAN: THEY GO UP STEPS.\nACE: Some security. Doors open and everyone’s asleep.\nNATHAN: Looks like it all went to plan.\nACE: There’s a robbery going on?\nNATHAN: This is the thing I thought you could help with. Sticking a Spanner in their works. Gloria’s works.\nACE: Gloria?\nNATHAN: Lefty’s ‘accountant’. Appeared out of nowhere last week. She’s quite a force of nature.\nPOLICE: SIRENS APPROACH.\nNATHAN: Ah. Not quite to plan, then. We should hide somewhere. Inside.\nACE: I thought you were the police?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 65\nNATHAN: I am. Just not the Ricostan police.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: INT.

I think we have the measure of one another. Come on in. It’s open.\nPSYCHIC: PULSE.\nATOMON: (FX) Why yes... I- Aaaagh!\nATOMON: SQUELCH OF SLUMPING TENTACLES.\nDOCTOR: (PANTING WITH EFFORT) Very much bigger on the inside. Can be a shock if you’re not expecting it. Enough of a shock to buy me\nDOCTOR: some time.

OUTSIDE VAULT\nDOCTOR WHO: CODE-CRACKER CYCLING THROUGH COMBINATIONS.\nGLORIA: How are we doing?\nMEL: Almost there. Safe-cracking has become a speciality of mine. Lots of practice, recently. There we are!\nCLUNK: AS VAULT DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS.\nGLORIA: Good. One more door to go.\nPOLICE: ARRIVE IN FOYER NOISILY, OFF.\nLEFTY: What’s that? No-one should be able to get near this place.\nPOLICE: (LOUD-HAILER, OFF) This is the police! Nobody move! We know you’re in there, Mr Lonnigan.\nLEFTY: What?! Someone’s grassed!\nGLORIA: Nathan!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44: INT. CORRIDOR, OUTSIDE VAULT ROOM\nPOLICE: ASSEMBLING AT END OF CORRIDOR. ACE AND NATHAN SNEAK ALONG.\nACE: (SOTTO) But if the police are onto them-\nNATHAN: (SOTTO) It’s a bit more complicated than that. Ricostan police can be very accommodating.\nPOLICE: (LOUD-HAILER, OFF) Two minutes, Lonnigan. Then you give yourself up.\nNATHAN: (SOTTO) They’re as likely to take a bribe as arrest him. I need to catch him in the act. (PULLS OUT WEAPONS)\nACE: Which is why you brought — guns?\nNATHAN: Something tells me you’re a crack shot, Ace.\nACE: I have my moments.\nPASSES: WEAPON TO ACE.\nNATHAN: Here. Remember where they’re standing. I’m about to drop a smoke grenade.\nACE: You’re giving me a gun?\nNATHAN: Stun-gun. I’m not gonna hand you a deadly weapon. I’m not that stupid.\nACE: I could still shoot you.\nNATHAN: And you’re not that stupid either. We’d both end up in prison. Ready? Five of them.\nACE: Ready.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 69\nNATHAN: THROWS SMOKE GRENADE — POP AND A HISS.\nPOLICE: (CONFUSION, COUGHING) ‘What?’\nPOLICE: ACE AND NATHAN RUN IN. FIVE TASER BLASTS IN QUICK SUCCESSION.\nPOLICE: Aaagh!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: INT. OUTSIDE VAULT (CONTINUOUS )\nPOLICE: FALL TO GROUND. ACE AND NATHAN RUN UP.\nNATHAN: (CALLING) Mr Lonnigan!\nLEFTY: (JUST OFF) Nathan. I thought you’d grassed.\nNATHAN: Not me, boss. I was running Plan B all along. If our new recruit couldn’t remember how to fly that thing... I thought I’d bring someone who could.\nACE: Hang on. I haven’t agreed to anything yet.\nGLORIA: Lefty. Go with Nathan. Help the others tie up those policemen before they wake up.\nLEFTY: Good idea.\nLEFTY: LEFTY AND NATHAN WALK OFF.\nACE: And you — you're...\nMEL: (COUGHS, APPROACHING) I know that voice... Ace? Is that you?\nACE: Donut?! What are you doing here? (BEAT) Hang on. Are you cracking a safe?\nGLORIA: Isn’t this nice. Can we get on?\nACE: But you’ re-\nMEL: Yes. Ace. There’s something you need to know.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. VAULT (CONTINUOUS)\nATOMON: STIRRING. DOCTOR DROPS DOWN FROM CABLING.\nDOCTOR: I’ve bought a few minutes. Long enough for whoever’s out there to open these doors.\nDOCTOR: HURRIES TO DOOR.\nACE: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE) You mean you already know?\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Ace!\nMEL: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE) About the Doctor? Yes. Yes I do.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) My oh my. Miss Melanie Bush.\nGLORIA: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE) Ahem. Perhaps I should explain, Mel.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) And... who’s that?\nACE: (MUFFLED, OUTSIDE) Is it you? Really you?\nGLORIA: (MUFFLED OUTSIDE) Same hat, same coat. Same old me, Ace.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Really. Who is that?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. BANK VAULT (CONTINUOUS )\nGLORIA: I hope you remember all I taught you. Because we’1ll need to warm her up and be ready to-\nACE: (INTERRUPTS) Right! Of course. You need to get in the TARDIS and-\nMEL: (CUTS ACROSS THEM — SHE’S GOT TO STOP ACE HELPING) Ace. Don’t agree to anything.\nACE: Hang on, Donut. You don’t understand. If this is the Doctor...\nMEL: That’s the thing. It’s not. This is someone who was lining you up to be their patsy until I came along.\nGLORIA: Melanie?\nMEL: Drop the act, Gloria. I’ve already worked it out. It’s a con.\nACE: But I saw it happen!\nMEL: What you saw was Gloria here dressed up. What did you do? Bung on a hat and a wig? Fake some special effects? If only I’d been there, I'd have known the difference.\nACE: But... I’ve read about it. It’s a total change.\nMEL: Think, Ace! When the Doctor made a break for it, before he got shot. Did you actually see his face? (BEAT) Didn’t think so. You needn’t have gone to all that trouble, Gloria. I never believed you were him. I’m robbing this vault for my own reasons.\nACE: You? Is this Glitz’s idea?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 73\nMEL: No. Glitz isn’t here because Glitz left me in the lurch. I need thousands of credits and I need them now. If going along with Gloria’s little charade helps me get them — well, that’s good enough for me.\nACE: But Donut-—\nMEL: Mel. And lovely as it is to see you again, Ace, I don’t need you coming along and messing everything up now! Keep a hold of her, Gloria.\nGLORIA: A pleasure. (GRABS ACE)\nACE: Wha- (GRABBED)\nMEL: I need some peace while I finish cracking this vault.\nMEL: SAFE-CRACKING TOOL BUZZES.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT.

You are not Lefty Lonnigan.\nDOCTOR: No. Unless it means you’1l let me go. In which case, yes.\nATOMON: (FX) I’ve wasted time tuning my quantum extraction to the wrong bio-signature. You are something more.\nDOCTOR: It’s often been said.\nATOMON: (SLITHERING CLOSER, FX) I’ve a good mind to kill you for inconveniencing me.\nDOCTOR: You’re not the only one who’s been inconvenienced!\nATOMON: (FX) But it would be a waste. I sense a tantalising banquet of potentiality...\nDOCTOR: Oh, you’ve no idea... But you can’t feed off my potential until\nDOCTOR: you’re inside my mind.\nATOMON: (FX) And you have been particularly good at keeping me out.\nLOCKS: SLIDE OPEN.\nATOMON: (FX) What is that noise?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT.

Well, Glitz said she’d be a soft touch.\nNATHAN: But then she got arrested and Melanie Bush turned up.\nGLORIA: And I could spin the story again. To someone who’d be even more likely to buy it. Couldn’t have been more wrong about that. It’s a lesson. Always keep your options open.\nNATHAN: I know you do that more than anyone.

It saddens me that you of all people have got bogged down in such grubby concerns.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 86\nMEL: Oh.\nACE: (DRIVING) But it sounds like you don’t actually have any money.\nMEL: No. The Sperovores aren’t known for their favourable lending terms.\nACE: Sperovore?\nDOCTOR: The creature in the vault.\nMEL: They’re the ones we owe all the money to.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Their greedy appetites extend far beyond their collective stomach.\nACE: So they’re rich. Fat-cat bankers. Fat... cuttlefish bankers.\nDOCTOR: One of the wealthiest species in the galaxy. If not the wealthiest. They’ve cornered the market in futures. Everyone’s futures. A place like this could be rich pickings.\nACE: Did you see those tentacles? Mouths instead of suckers.\nDOCTOR: All the better to eat every alternative version of your reality with.\nMEL: I admit it.

But it explains a few things about this planet’s economy. Do you think it saw me?\nNATHAN: No. Too busy grabbing Lefty and Charlie and the others. So that’s a Sperovore? I’ve never seen one before.\nGLORIA: They’re not big on public appearances. You don’t need to be when you’re holding the credit notes for half the galaxy. When you’re the major shareholder in every bank, every insurance plan, every pension scheme in this sector. You just stay at home and count the cash.\nNATHAN: Sperovore Investment Holdings. Seems like every crook in this sector has some kind of arrangement with them.\nGLORIA: I know. Because I arranged most of them. Even for poor old Lefty.\nNATHAN: Well. I suppose we don’t need to worry about him finding out. You know. About us.\nHOVERBOAT: SLOWS AS NATHAN PULLS UP INTO DOCK.\nNATHAN: We’re here.\nGLORIA: So.

But then, it doesn’t matter when you’re being dissolved one molecule at a time! Of course I’m gonna run. (BREAKS OFF, ZIPS CASE) Do you think I can get more shoes in here?\nNATHAN: Why are they here? Are they coming for Lefty?\nGLORIA: I told you. Everyone here is in deep shtuck with them. Even little miss carrot-curls.\nNATHAN: Mel? You think she’s got some kind of arrangement with S.I. Holdings?\nGLORIA: I know so. Well, her business partner had. Only Sabalom Glitz defaulted on his debts. I’ve seen his accounts. He was way over his eyes in hock to S.I. One of the last deals I did was to Sign all his liabilities over to our Miss Bush — including herself as security.\nNATHAN: Hold on. Does she know?\nGLORIA: I doubt it. Small print so small you need an electron microscope. She was ready to take the readies. What with her previous history in that time-travel box of tricks, the Sperovores seem to think she’s worth a whole lot of planet.\nNATHAN: What about our arrangement?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 93\nGLORIA: You were fun while you lasted, Mr Later. But our little fling was always on borrowed time. If Lefty had ever found out-\nNATHAN: Lefty’s gone.\nGLORIA: Yeah.\nNATHAN: So?\nGLORIA: So...\nNATHAN: You and me.\nGLORA: HEAVES SUITCASES ONTO FLOOR. HEADS FOR DOOR.\nGLORIA: I’m leaving. You’re pretty. But not so pretty I’1ll risk my neck.\nNATHAN: Well. In that case. That’s helped me make up my mind. I’m just\nNATHAN: gonna have to make an honest woman of you.\nGLORIA: (STOPPING) You’1l1... do what?\nNATHAN: (APPROACHING) Gloria Swannicker. Will you do me the honour.\nNATHAN: CLICKS ON HANDCUFFS.\nNATHAN: Of accompanying me to Galactic Police HQ.\nGLORIA: What?\nNATHAN: You’re nicked.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. VAULT\nGURGLING: ABSORPTION OF FEEDING SPEROVORES. VAULT DOOR SWINGS OPEN.\nMAYOR: (OUTSIDE DOOR) Hello? I’m sorry to disturb but-\nATOMON: (FX) Stay there! We are occupied.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (PSYCHIC FX) The palate is sensational. And we have made our decision. Our final meal was worth the investment at least.\nMAYOR: APPROACHES OUTSIDE.\nMAYOR: (OUTSIDE DOOR) Excuse me? May I interrupt?\nATOMON: (FX) I said stay!\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (PSYCHIC FX) Who disturbs our repast?\nATOMON: (FX) One of the Ricostan creatures. Please, continue digesting while I pass on the news.\nTENTACLES: EXTEND INTO HALL.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. OUTSIDE VAULT\nDOCTOR WHO: ATOMON’S TENTACLES SLITHER OUT OF VAULT DOOR.\nMAYOR: Um... Who’s that?\nATOMON: (FX) Mr Lefty Lonnigan is within.\nMAYOR: Yes. I already went to his funeral.\nATOMON: (FX) I am not happy. My brothers and sisters are not happy. It has been ratified by the board. Sperovore involvement with this planet is over.\nMAYOR: What do you mean?\nATOMON: (FX) Ricosta is exposed. We cannot afford exposure.\nMAYOR: Please. No. Anyone who knows, we can find them. Track them down and get rid of them. There’s no reason our arrangement cannot continue.\nATOMON: (FX) It is too late. They are coming.\nMAYOR: What?\nATOMON: (FX) I have already called in the receivers. The proposal was passed unanimously. My Sperovore brethren are on their way.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: EXT. OUTSIDE MAYOR’S OFFICE.\nBUSTLING: CROWD. TRAFFIC STARTING TO MOVE AGAIN.\nACE: Why have we come back to that useless Mayor’s office? We could have gone anywhere. What about that secret island Mel was on about?\nMEL: That’s where Lefty’s gang will have regrouped. What’s left of them anyway.\nDOCTOR: I need the help of the local authorities to retrieve the TARDIS with the minimum of fuss. I suspect they may already know what’s in their Vault. But I know what those creatures can do.\nACE: The Sperovores?\nDOCTOR: Eaters of hope. Devourers of dreams. They feed on possibility itself.\nACE: Alternative realities. Parallel universes. I get it. Potential energy flows between every point in the multiverse. And they can stick their tentacles in the stream.\nMEL: Ace? How do you know all this? How long have I been away?\nDOCTOR: Time is relative. For you, it might only have been a matter of months.\nACE: But for me and the Doctor. Well, we’ve had a whole world of adventures in between.\nMEL: Days like crazy paving.\nDOCTOR: You remember?\nMEL: Like it was yesterday. How could I ever forget?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Memory like an elephant. Of course. Ah Mel, we’re all of us made of dust and made of stars. But you decide which one you reach for.\nMEL: I can tell you’re disappointed. If you’d just give me a chance to explain.\nDOCTOR: No time. Sorry. We never get the time, do we? Before we're plunged into another life or death situation. And here we are again. Another planet. Another ultimatum.\nACE: Yeah, but can we save the reminiscing till we’ve got the TARDIS back from that room full of octopus legs?\nMAYOR: APPROACHES.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Here comes the Mayor. Perhaps we can help each other.\nACE: I doubt it. The Ricostans aren’t much use for anything. Unless it’s a cover-up. And that one’s as crooked as they come.\nMEL: No. If the Doctor’s right, and they’re already trapped in some kind of deal with the Sperovores, they’1ll be desperate for any way out they can get.\nDOCTOR: Very astute, Mel. There were a lot of bodies in that Vault. And its occupant knew who to expect next. As if everything’s been done to order...\nMAYOR: (APPROACHING) Excuse me... You’re waiting for me?\nMEL: Yes. Mayor.\nMAYOR: Sorry. I’m terribly busy.\nDOCTOR: I know. Your world is in danger. And I’m the only one who can save it.\nMAYOR: In that case. You’d better come in...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: THEY ENTER MAYOR’S OFFICE.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: INT. SPEROVORE FINANCE OFFICES\nDOCTOR WHO: MUZAK ON PHONE. CUTS OFF. BEEP OF CONNECTION.\nGLORIA: (VIA PHONE) Hello? Is that a real person?\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (FX) You are through to Sperovore Financial Services. How can we help?\nGLORIA: (VIA PHONE) Customer code. Alpha nine, alpha zero, one one, treble seven.\nBEEPING: AS DETAILS ARE BROUGHT UP.\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (FX) Ah. Yes. Miss Swannicker. One of our most valuable associates. How can we be of service today?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: INT. SECRET ISLAND HIDEAWAY (CONTINUOUS)\nGLORIA: (TO PHONE) I’d like to-\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (VIA PHONE, FX) Please hold while I bring up your account details.\nGLORIA: PACING, MUZAK PLAYING ON PHONE.\nNATHAN: I’m stretching the rules letting you do this.\nGLORIA: One phone call. I’m allowed one phone call, right?\nNATHAN: Usually people call their lawyer. Not their financial advisers.\nMUZAK: STOPS.\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (D) Miss Swannicker? Thank you for holding.\nGLORIA: Shh! They’re back. (TO PHONE) I currently find myself attached to one of your... um... assets as it enters liquidation mode. The planet Ricosta?\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (VIA PHONE, FX) Hmm. I’ve got that coming up negative.\nGLORIA: Check again. It’s a very recent transaction.\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (VIA PHONE, FX) I see. Yes. We’re getting updated now. All assets on the planet surface are in the process of being seized.\nGLORIA: That’s my issue. I am on the surface. I and my... associate would like to enquire after a means of departure.\nSPEROVORE FINANCIER: (VIA PHONE, FX) I see. (BEAT) A new credit advance would normally require an application through our-.\nGLORIA: (INTERRUPTS) Tell you what. This is rather urgent. Any chance I can speak to your manager?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR, ACE & MEL ENTER BEHIND MAYOR. AND CLOSE THE DOOR.\nMAYOR: So: how exactly can you help?\nDOCTOR: I’m guessing, Mr Mayor, that your guest is a little annoyed.\nMAYOR: (FEIGNING IGNORANCE) Guest?\nACE: Drop the act, fur-face. It’ll save us all a lot of time.\nMEL: We know about the Sperovores. You’ve cooked up some arrangement where you’re handing over your residents in exchange for... what?\nDOCTOR: A line of credit, perhaps?\nMAYOR: (COVERING UP) We have faced challenging times. Everyone has had to tighten their belts, but with careful fiscal management, Ricosta has come through. Now we are a land of plenty!\nMEL: (WORKING IT OUT) You were in a lot of trouble with the galactic common currency a while back. Overspending, trying to attract business... but no proper control over your debts.\nDOCTOR: Since then, the planet’s ‘economic miracle’ has been somewhat... miraculous.\nACE: (REALISATION) You’re feeding these Sperovores all your ex-pats just to keep the ouzo flowing!\nMEL: And keeping it all hushed up. Until now.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Come along, Mr Mayor. My friends and I are right. I can only begin to help if you admit what’s been going on here.\nMAYOR: (BEAT, RELUCTANT) We only hand them over when they’re dead. Or dying...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR: Yes. Suspended on the point of expiration. I’ve had first-hand experience.\nMAYOR: Atomon. The Sperovore’s.. catering agent. He was installed years ago. We had no use for the bank as a financial depository any longer, it was the most secure location.\nMEL: The most secure location? For what?\nDOCTOR: Anyone who dies on Ricosta. They’re frozen, suspended just before life-signs completely fade. Then shipped to the Vault. Am I correct, Mr Mayor?\nMAYOR: We make a small interment charge to deal with the bodies... But I’m assured it’s all done as humanely as possible. The subject has a chance to reflect.\nMEL: What is it they say about your whole life flashing before your eyes when you die?\nDOCTOR: Only, these people see every possible life. The Vault is filled with technology to enhance the flavour. Something akin to marinading in your own juices.\nACE: ‘Retire to Ricosta. And let the Sperovores chow down on your remains’. I bet you don’t put that in the brochure.\nPANICKING: CROWDS, OUTSIDE. RUMBLE OF SHIPS IN FAR DISTANCE OVERHEAD.\nWILDTRACK RICOSTANS: (SCREAMS OF PANIC, OFF) Aaagh!/ What is that?/ It’s coming this way! [ETC]\nACE: Sounds like something’s spooking the locals. (RUNNING OFF) I’11 go and check it out!\nACE: EXITS OFFICE.\nDOCTOR: So? Anything to say, Mr Mayor?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 103\nMAYOR: It was meant to be secret.\nMEL: I bet the Sperovores thought that way too. They don’t want your grubby little deal exposed. People might look at their businesses in a whole new light. (BEAT) Hang on... It’s gone very dark outside all of a sudden.\nDOCTOR: USES SONIC.\nDOCTOR: Planetary shielding. They’ve put the whole world in lockdown. Just to keep everything quiet.\nMAYOR: I know... Ships can’t get in, or out. There’s a beacon warning Ricosta is closed for business. I’ve had representatives from the port authorities calling me for the last half hour.\nDOCTOR: So much for you trying to make a quick getaway. That’s what all these piles of cash are meant for, I presume.\nMEL: You were trying to save your own skin and leave everyone else to face the music?\nBUILDINGS: CRASH, JUST OFF. CROWDS RUN SCREAMING. ACE RUNS IN.\nMEL: Things are about to get a whole lot worse.\nACE: (BREATHLESS) Hate to be the bearer of bad news. But there’s a twenty-foot squid coming down the high street. (SNIFFS) What’s that smell? Ozone?\nSONIC: BOOM ABOVE. OFFICE WINDOWS SHATTER. CROWDS SCREAMING IN TERROR.\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) The arrival of a hyperspace ship.\nSEVERAL: MORE BOOMS. MORE PANIC.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR: (OVER NOISE) Lots of hyperspace ships!\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Attention all residents of Ricosta!\nATOMON: (CALLING, OUTSIDE) Lord Mayor! Prepare yourself! My people are arriving!\nDOCTOR: Atomon.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: INT. SECRET HIDEAWAY\nCOMMS: ROOM CONTROLS. BEEPING OF BEACON, WITH REPEATED MESSAGE\nRECORDING: PLAYBACK.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (VIA MONITOR, FX) Repeat. Sperovore Investment Holdings is foreclosing on Ricosta. Ricosta is closed for business. Ricostan space is restricted. Do not enter. Repeat.\nGLORIA: That’s the beacon message. To everyone outside of orbit. Warning them off. Keeping us in isolation. While Down here on the surface... (USES CONTROLS TO CHANGE CHANNELS) .. this is all over the news feed. But no-one offworld is ever gonna see it.\nCHANNEL: SWITCHES TO SHOW DISTANT CARNAGE OF SPEROVORE TENTACLES\nATTACKING: CITIES, SMASHING BUILDINGS, PEOPLE FLEEING, ON SCREEN.\nNATHAN: What the hell is going on out there?\nGLORIA: Giant tentacles coming out of the sky, scooping people up into their ships. For a prolonged and horrible death. I think that just about covers it.\nNATHAN: How can they do this?\nGLORIA: They like to present a respectable face to the outside universe when they do business. Well, as respectable as you can be, given their clientele. But once the receivers get called in, the planetary shields go up and all bets are off.\nNATHAN: They’re keeping everything hidden, while they strip every living thing off the planet. Are we safe on the island?\nGLORIA: Won't be long before they find us. They’re looking for all life forms. So they can squeeze out their possibilities and serve them up for their collective dinner.\nNATHAN: How are we supposed to get away? (BEAT, PRESSES COMMS) I know. I can contact them. Show my warrant card.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 106\nGLORIA: You think that will make the slightest bit of difference? One policeman? They’1ll eat you along with everyone else.\nNATHAN: STOPS.\nGLORIA: To the outside universe, Ricosta is closed for business. Down here... well, it’s gonna be a feeding frenzy. (BEAT) Nathan, honey. I think I need another phone call.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: EXT. RICOSTA STREET (OUTSIDE MAYOR’S OFFICE)\nSONIC: BOOM AGAIN. WINDOWS SHATTER. SCREAMS OF PANIC. PEOPLE\nRUNNING: INTO THE STREETS. DOCTOR, ACE, MEL AND MAYOR EXIT OFFICE.\nMAYOR: (CALLING) Please. There’s no need for this.\nATOMON: (CALLING, OFF, FX) We have your final demand.\nMEL: Look at all those ships! They’re huge! They’re blotting out the sky! And what’s that coming down out of them? Cables? Legs... no...\nACE: Tentacles... covered in mouths. Just like in the vault. Only now there are loads, they’re bigger, and they’re everywhere!\nDOCTOR: They’re no longer hiding. Things are much worse than we’d imagined.\nATOMON: (OFF, FX) Mmm. I taste the first of them being absorbed on the ship. Piquant, like a mature cheese. Fear brings a sharpness that is most pleasing to the palate!\nDOCTOR: RUNS TOWARDS ATOMON.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Stop this! Atomon! Tell your people to stop this slaughter!\nACE: Haven’t you got any weapons, Mr Mayor? Where are your police?\nMAYOR: They ran at the first sign of trouble.\nATOMON: (FX) (LAUGHING) Run, run all you like, people of Ricosta. So many ways. So many choices. These will be sweet. More like a dessert wine.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 108\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX, BOOMING FROM ABOVE) Attention Ricosta! Be informed this planet has defaulted on its debt to the Sperovores. All lives now present on this world are assets.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: We have declared complete liquidation. With extreme prejudice. Every life can be foreclosed immediately!\nSPEROVORE BANKER: Sperovore Investment Holdings have come to collect.\nMORE: SLITHERING TENTACLES DESCEND FROM SHIPS.\nWILDTRACK RICOSTANS: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 109"

The ports are locked. Nothing leaving. Nothing coming in.\nGLORIA: Told you. Planetary shielding. Even your police ship’s not getting into orbit. Whatever else happens, sweetheart, you’re not taking me to lockup today.\nNATHAN: (STOPS USING CONTROLS) I guess not.\nGLORIA: Nathan. Listen. I know you’re a cop. I know you’ve a job to do. But you and me... we worked. We clicked. Those few days we had... Isn’t it worth giving ‘us’ a chance?\nNATHAN: I... don’t know.\nGLORIA: You do. You know you do. Look at me. Nathan, sweetie. Just look.\nNATHAN: It’s not fair. You know what you do to me when- (GETS KISSED)\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 110\nGLORIA: MOVES IN FOR A SMOOCH.\nGLORIA: (KISSING NATHAN) See. It’s still there. (BEAT) And I’ve got one other thing that might interest you. Something that financial adviser gave me. The number for S.I. HQ. A direct hotline to the boardroom. On one of those ships up there.\nNATHAN: You tried talking. They didn’t listen.\nGLORIA: Those were the monkeys. These are the organ-grinders. They want Ricosta locked down and shut up. They don’t care about the police. But they do care about an accountant.\nNATHAN: You think you can make a deal?\nGLORIA: RATTLES HER HANDCUFFS.\nGLORIA: Unlock these cuffs again. Let me give it a try...\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71: EXT. OUTSIDE MAYOR’S OFFICE\nTENTACLES: GRABBING PEOPLE.\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) I said stop this! Or do you want me to make you stop? Then you really would regret it.\nSONIC: SCREWDRIVER BUZZES VERY HIGH PITCHED.\nMAYOR: (CALLING, JUST OFF) Doctor. Don’t antagonise them! I thought you said you could help.\nACE: (HEADING OFF) OK, your police have scarpered. But you must have an armoury, right? Show me, fuzzball.\nMEL: (FOLLOWING) Ace? What are you planning? Wait!\nATOMON: (FX) Ow. That noise is spoiling my appetite. Who’s doing that?\nDOCTOR: I’m disrupting your psychic connection. Not much, but it got your attention.\nATOMON: (FX) Oh, it’s you. The strange one. (CALLING) Sperovore brethren. Wait!\nSONIC: STOPS. TENTACLES STOP GRABBING PEOPLE.\nDOCTOR: I am willing to negotiate. But you gain nothing unless you stop\nDOCTOR: and listen.\nATOMON: (FX) Negotiate? With what? We already own this world.\nDOCTOR: I am not of this world.

But I’m not sure what he’s offering.\nACE: He’s doing what he always does. Creating a distraction. Really, Donut. Leave this to me. Actually, forget the armoury. I’ve had a better idea.\nMEL: What?\nACE: Don’t you see? While big, slimy and ugly is out here. Who’s down in the vault?\nMEL: No-one.\nACE: Exactly. Mr Mayor? You’re coming with me.\nMAYOR: Are you sure that’s wise?\nMEL: We should probably wait and see what the Doctor-\nACE: Listen, Donut. Sorry. But I’ve been doing this a lot, lot longer than you ever did.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 113\nMEL: Ace-\nACE: It’s easy. The monster’s out of the vault. The Doctor’s keeping it busy so we can get to the TARDIS.\nMEL: And then what? You can’t actually fly it. (BEAT) Oh. You think you can?\nACE: Not just ‘think’. I’ve been having lessons. You stay here, out of trouble. Me and Tufty will go and do the heavy lifting.\nMEL: I’ve been out there too. Travelling the universe-\nACE: Yeah. Raking off a tidy profit. Not so much of the saving planets.\nMEL: That’s not fair-\nACE: Leave it to me. Are you in, Mr Mayor?\nMAYOR: I’m all for going anywhere those things aren’t. The Vault. It’s underground. Secure. Lockable. You’ve convinced me. But it’s all the way across town.\nACE: Then we’d better get a shift on.

Delightfully spicy so far.\nSPEROVORES: MURMURS OF AGREEMENT IN B/G\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (VIA PHONE, FX) We’re all enjoying them very much here in the boardroom.\nGLORIA: Riiiight. (BEAT) That’s my issue, you see. I’m here, but I’m not a resident asset. I’d like to enquire after some kind of exit.\nSPEROVORE: (VIA PHONE, FX) I see.\nGLORIA: Check my records. You’1l see I’ve brought you many, many lucrative prospects in the past. And I hope to continue to do so in the future, so long as I remain alive enough to achieve that end.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (VIA PHONE, FX) That is an impressive record, Miss Swannicker.\nGLORIA: Please, call me Gloria.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (VIA PHONE, FX) Hold one moment.\nNATHAN: What are they saying?\nGLORIA: (TO NATHAN) Shh!

You’re keeping track of my quantum trace?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Of course. We never know when we’1ll need to cash in any of our associates. Hmm. Possibility trails such as yours aren’t always the best eating... So we can weigh that alongside potential future business.\nSPEROVORE: ACTIVATES GLOOPY COMPUTER CONTROLS UNDER FOLLOWING.\nREADOUTS: PRINTING.\nGLORIA: (D) Then I’ve every confidence this will come out in my favour. (BEAT) Well?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) S. I. Holdings computers say... ‘yes’. You can be released. But-\nGLORIA: (D) There had to be a ‘but’.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) A down-payment would expedite your exit. To an immediate\nSPEROVORE BANKER: priority.\nGLORIA: (D) Down-payment? OK.

Well, then — you know a short pause between courses aids digestion. Please. Amuse us. What is your proposal?\nDOCTOR: What will it take for you to leave this world alone?\nATOMON: (FX) Hmm. We will commune, check the accounts. We have been propping up the economy of this planet for a very long time.\nMEL: (APPROACHING) I think you can afford it. Several galaxies would need to go bust before you’d even notice a dent.\nDOCTOR: Mel. I told everyone to stay back.\nMEL: You should remember, Doctor. I don’t always do what I’m told.\nATOMON: (FX) Ah yes. This one. Melanie Bush. She is also in our ledgers.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nATOMON: (FX) She is of exceptional value.\nDOCTOR: Every life is of exceptional value, Atomon.\nATOMON: (FX) But Miss Bush. She has the scent of many realities, many different universes. (SNIFFING) What an aroma. Intoxicating.\nMEL: Charmed, I’m sure.\nATOMON: (FX) How was this achieved?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: If you don’t know, then I’m not at liberty to say.\nATOMON: (FX) No matter. Mr Glitz has already used up several of her alternative futures to extend his line of credit.\nDOCTOR: He’s done what?\nMEL: My ‘futures’?\nATOMON: (FX) Of course, some of those futures are now past. I understand humans see them in dreams. Our representatives visited you while you slept.\nMEL: Hyper-jumps! I knew we didn’t need to go into cryo-sleep every Single time! Why, that no-good, self-serving, manipulating-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTS) Mel. What’s done is done. Or rather never-will- have-been done.\nATOMON: (FX) Yes. She has many futures. We could absorb her now. Devour every future except one. That would offset a considerable amount of the debt...\nMEL: What would that leave me with? Which future?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76: EXT. RICOSTA STREETS\nDOCTOR WHO: ACE AND MAYOR HURRY ALONG DESERTED STREETS.

Waiting.\nMAYOR: Ricosta was such a beautiful world.\nACE: You’re the one who asked the gangsters to move in.\nMAYOR: It worked so well, for a while. It’s a paradise. People were happy to spend. Then the financial crisis came. Our debts were called in. Sperovore Holdings offered to bail us out.\nACE: I’ll bet they did. So they could set up their very own kitchen with foie gras on tap.\nMAYOR: I have faced many criminals in my time. None have scared me quite so much as you, Miss Ace.\nACE: I’ll take that as a compliment. OK, this is the plan. Find the TARDIS. Take it to the Doctor. Then we save your planet. And your tail stays where it is. Deal?\nMAYOR: Deal.\nMAYOR: THEY HURRY ON.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77: INT.

It can’t be!\nNATHAN: What?\nGLORIA: That dirty, double-crossing, low-down rat!\nNATHAN: Who?\nGLORIA: Glitz. He’s emptied them. He must have used some hacker to get in. And his rainy day has already come.\nNATHAN: He’s robbed you?\nGLORIA: Me... and Lefty. Everything, siphoned off into Nosferatu’s accounts.\nNATHAN: You can’t go back to the Sperovores with nothing.\nGLORIA: I’m not beaten yet. Oh no. You’ve got special police codes, haven’t you? To look into dodgy banking.\nNATHAN: Yes.. I’ve been tracking Lefty’s funds.\nGLORIA: TYPES AGAIN.\nGLORIA: Then give them to me. We follow the money... We follow my money!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78: EXT. RICOSTAN STREET\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND MEL WALK A SHORT WAY FROM ATOMON.\nMEL: The Sperovores are willing to take me, and let this planet go.\nDOCTOR: They’ve given us time to think it over. But it’s not for me to make that choice. I’d never give you up, Mel. But I don’t feel I know you any more.\nMEL: What? How can you think that?\nDOCTOR: What else am I supposed to think? So many lives placed in danger. All for the pursuit of money.\nMEL: You’ve got the wrong end of the stick, Doctor. Really, you have.\nDOCTOR: What happened to Melanie Jane Bush from Pease Pottage? With her moral compass that never wavered?\nMEL: Are you the same person you always were? (BEAT) After you regenerated, well, I thought you were sweet, funny. So different from what you were before — but still the same. But now.. Is your ‘moral compass’ still working?\nDOCTOR: Of course, but-\nMEL: Then so’s mine. It’s working perfectly.\nDOCTOR: Mel, I-\nMEL: I need you to be quiet, Doctor. I need you to listen.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79: INT. SECRET HIDEAWAY\nGLORIA: TAPPING KEYS.\nGLORIA: Nothing. No credits whatsoever. Everywhere the same signature code. The hacker’s backdoor. An address, ‘Pease Pottage’. (BEAT) It’s her. She did it. She’s robbed me blind! Every last penny!\nNATHAN: Who did?\nGLORIA: Melanie Bush!\nTHROWS: COMPUTER TERMINAL ACROSS ROOM.\nNATHAN: Gloria. Calm down-\nGLORIA: (FURIOUS) Quiet! I’m thinking!\nSMASHES: ANOTHER COMPUTER AGAINST WALL.\nGLORIA: Wait. There is something else. Something I can offer. Not strictly mine. But I do have a key. In my purse! I didn’t give it back!\nGLORIA: SCRABBLES IN PURSE.\nNATHAN: A key? (PENNY DROPS) Oh, riiight. But it’s in the Vault. How will we get past the tentacles and back to the mainland?\nGLORIA: Don’t worry. Once the Sperovores know exactly what’s on the table, they’1ll have us there in a flash.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80: EXT. RICOSTAN STREET\nMEL: When I left, I think you hoped I’d get Glitz on the straight and narrow. So did I. But he’s too much of a recidivist to change. He’s committed to his life of crime. That’s the only honest thing about him!\nDOCTOR: I should never have let you go-\nMEL: Quiet, Doctor! Instead, I did the only thing I could. I did what you’d do. Every time we left a place, I made sure we left it better than we’d found it. Whatever scheme, whatever con Glitz was running, he’d pay his takings into his dodgy accounts. Only he hadn’t the slightest clue that I’d already hacked them. That I made sure those funds — and more - went back to help the helpless. Feed the hungry. Home the homeless.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Mel...\nMEL: I’m still talking! It was the same here. Who do you think informed the Ricostan police about the robbery? I didn’t buy Gloria’s story for a second. I wanted to get the bad guys locked away so I could look after the TARDIS, until you — the real you — turned up. Because I know you always do.\nDOCTOR: And I’m here. Now.\nMEL: Are you? My Doctor believed in me. Why don’t you? No trust, no faith, no confidence. You’re questioning me? Perhaps you’re the imposter after all.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Mel. I’m sorry.\nATOMON: SLITHERS OVER.\nATOMON: Have you finished?\nMEL: Yes. Yes we have. (WALKING BACK OVER TO ATOMON) You can take me, Atomon. I’1ll give myself up if it means this planet can live.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81: INT.

It’s always wise.\nACE: CRACKS AND RENDING METAL AS TENTACLES BREAK THROUGH ROOF.\nMAYOR: You said it was empty!\nACE: I said the coast was clear. I didn’t know they’d be coming through the roof!\nMAYOR: Not just the roof. Look! Teleports!\nTELEPORT: BEAM AS GLORIA AND NATHAN ARRIVE.

Or my tentacled friend will squish you.\nNATHAN: Sorry Ace. We’re gonna have to take this box.\nGLORIA: It’s our collateral. Our ticket out of here.\nACE: It’s not yours!\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Why are they here? Is this an attempt at deception?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 124\nGLORIA: No! You know me. I always play straight down the line with Sperovore Financial. It doesn’t pay me to do anything else.\nMAYOR: Please. I want no part of this. Can I leave?\nGLORIA: This one. He’s the one you’ve an argument with. He messed up this world. Have an appetiser on me.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Ricostan.\nMAYOR: Y-yes?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) You have governed your world recklessly. Without thought for prudence and austerity. I find such financial mismanagement offensive in the extreme. Liquidate.\nTENTACLES: GRAB MAYOR. SUCKING PSYCHIC ABSORPTION.\nMAYOR: Aaaaggh!\nACE: RUNS TO TARDIS AND UNLOCKS IT.\nACE: Quick! Get in! Both of you!\nACE: ACE, GLORIA AND NATHAN RUSH INTO TARDIS.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Engage matter transporter. These co-ordinates.

Miss Swannicker made great claims for it.\nSPEROVORE: SLITHERS OFF.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) I sense something... tantalising in the air around it. Flavours beyond our experience.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) I will be in the boardroom. Digesting.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83: INT. TARDIS\nACE: What are you doing? Handing over the TARDIS to that bunch of slimeballs?\nGLORIA: We were getting off this world. We were on our way until you messed it up.\nNATHAN: Sorry Ace.\nACE: Nathan? You’re in on this too? I thought you were one of the good guys. (BEAT) Oh no. I know that doe-eyed look. She’s got her claws into you, hasn’t she?\nGLORIA: (SIGH) Petty jealousies aside-\nACE: Oh, I’m not jealous. Just very, very annoyed.\nGLORIA: That aside - we should go out there and talk to them. They know me.\nACE: And in the five minutes I’ve spent with you, I think I do too. You’d sell your own granny to save your skin. So I don’t give much for our chances.\nNATHAN: Gotta say, Gloria. I’m inclined to agree with Ace.\nGLORIA: You don’t trust me either? Fine.\nNATHAN: What else can we do?\nACE: First things first. Let’s look outside.\nACE: ACTIVATES TARDIS MONITOR.\nNATHAN: Is that their ship? Eurgh.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 127\nACE: Looks like we’re alone. For now. I’m guessing we won’t have long before they call in their specialist time-spaceship assessors.\nGLORIA: What are you proposing?\nACE: We hit those slimy squid where it hurts. Find their control centre and blow it up.\nGLORIA: What with? I don’t happen to carry kilos of explosive around with me wherever I go.\nACE: PULLS OUT CRATE FULL OF NITRO-9 CANISTERS.\nACE: (EFFORT) See. Now that’s where you’re going wrong, right off the bat.\nCHUCKS: ONE TO NATHAN.\nACE: It’s called Nitro-Nine, pretty-boy. Catch.\nNATHAN: (REACTS) Uh!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84: INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR AND MEL ENTER. SLITHERING AS ATOMON FOLLOWS.\nATOMON: (FX) The Mayor has been commoditised. We can use his office to finalise the deal.\nMEL: Commoditised? Does that mean-\nDOCTOR: I’m rather afraid it does.\nATOMON: (FX, SMACKS LIPS) Fast food. Never satisfying. My people are preparing the paperwork.\nMEL: Couldn’t you have just killed me anyway?\nDOCTOR: That’s the difference between crisps and caviar.\nATOMON: (FX) Such a wealth of potential... willingly given. We can marinade you in every possibility. A rainbow of flavours that could sustain us for months. My ligula are moistening at the merest anticipation...\nDOCTOR: Are you sure, Mel?\nMEL: One life for many. I don’t have grey areas. Things are black and white. The right and the wrong thing to do.\nDOCTOR: It is you. You haven’t changed a bit. (BEAT) I can’t allow it, you know.\nMEL: If you know I’m me, then you know it’s pointless arguing. I’m as stubborn as they come.\nATOMON: (FX) Ready, girl? Are you prepared for death? In all its myriad possibilities?\nDOCTOR: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 129\nMEL: Doctor, we don’t have any choice. Not if we want to save the planet.\nDOCTOR: We do have a choice. Atomon. I’m offering you a new menu.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 85: INT.

Timer set to blow in three minutes.\nGLORIA: Now what?\nGLORIA: THEY CREEP TOWARDS DOORWAY.\nACE: We get back down that corridor, into the TARDIS and disappear.\nNATHAN: You really can fly that thing?\nACE: I keep telling everyone. I’ve had lessons.\nSLITHERING: TENTACLES APPROACH\nNATHAN: Uh-oh. Sperovore. Right outside and in the way.\nSPEROVORE AUDITOR: (FX, APPROACHING) What are you? The aroma is familiar. Exotic. We tasted something similar very recently.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 86: INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE\nATOMON: What, Doctor? What can you offer to match Melanie Bush?\nDOCTOR: Something of mine. Something I’ve been protecting all the while I’ve been here.\nMEL: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: In exchange for Mel. I can give you - my TARDIS.\nMEL: Doctor — you can’t!\nDOCTOR: It’s the very least I can do. To make up for doubting you.\nMEL: Please. There must be another way.\nDOCTOR: No. If you want quantum possibilities, the TARDIS can feed you all forever.\nATOMON: (CHUCKLING) We cannot take it.\nDOCTOR: Have I said something amusing?\nATOMON: (FX) We cannot take it from you. Because we already have it.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.. (REALISATION) Ace!\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 87: INT.

Get to the TARDIS!\nACE: ACE AND SPEROVORE STRUGGLE. NATHAN RUNS PAST.\nSPEROVORE AUDITOR: (FX) Euurgh! I am not used to handling ‘produce’!\nNATHAN: Hurry up, Ace. Gloria!

It’s what else she might have done that worries me...\nTARDIS: DOORS BURST OPEN, ACE STUMBLES OUT.\nACE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: What do you think you’re doing, Ace?\nATOMON: CRASHES THROUGH WALL OF MAYOR'S OFFICE ONTO STREET.\nDANGLING: TENTACLES WRITHE IN SKIES.\nATOMON: (FX) Pain... Poison!\nMEL: Is this all your handiwork, Ace? What happened?\nACE: Never mind the monsters. You’ve got to help us. It’s Nathan. He’s hurt. Badly hurt.\nDOCTOR: Come on Mel. We need you.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR, MEL AND ACE HURRY INTO TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 90: INT. TARDIS\nTARDIS: ALARMS. DOCTOR RUSHES TO CONSOLE.\nDOCTOR: Temporal buffers. Burnt out. Ah, but that’s not the real problem is it?\nMEL: RUSHES TO NATHAN.\nMEL: Doctor. This poor man. He’s...\nACE: He was caught in an explosion. Up on the ship. Can we do something?\nMEL: I’1l check medical. (RUNNING OFF) Is it still in the same place?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Mel!\nACE: Doctor. Can’t you leave the controls? Nathan’s dying. It’s all my fault.\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER) No. The TARDIS has been itching to sort this out Since before she arrived. That’s why we got here early. The poor old thing was confused.\nACE: What do you mean?\nSONIS: SCREWDRIVER BUZZ.\nDOCTOR: This man can’t die. Not yet. And it’s not exactly your fault, Ace. It’s causality. You’re simply Time’s unwitting agent. (CHECKS READINGS) Yes... I see it now. Like a Magic Eye picture. Stare long enough at what’s in front of you, and it all falls into place.\nMEL: RETURNS WITH MEDICAL KIT.\nMEL: I brought what I could find.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 138\nATOMON: (OUTSIDE, FX) Aaaagh! Doctor! What is happening to us!\nDOCTOR: Stabilise him. Something’s wrong with our alien gourmets.\nACE: Nathan’s dying here.\nMEL: Surely a touch of indigestion for the Sperovores can wait!\nDOCTOR: No. I need to see them. I’m afraid their last meal disagreed with them. It’s disagreeing with the entire cosmos.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 91: EXT. RICOSTAN STREETS\nDOCTOR: EXITS TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Atomon! A word!\nTENTACLES: WRITHING IN SKY. SPEROVORES MOANING IN PAIN.\nATOMON: (FX) What is happening? We are poisoned...\nSPEROVORE: (MOANING IN AGONY, FX) Infected... Diseased!\nDOCTOR: There’s someone in my ship in need of urgent medical attention.\nATOMON: (FX) So are we!\nDOCTOR: I need to leave and save his life. The right side of his body has been severely traumatised. That’s just the physical damage. He has mental scars too — partial absorption by your brethren has shredded his memories.\nDOCTOR: Well, you should! This man cannot die because he’s already lived.\nATOMON: What?\nDOCTOR: Nathan Later is Lefty Lonnigan. Or will be. But only if I set time back on the right course.\nATOMON: The potential... we cannot absorb a potential that never was...\nDOCTOR: While his fate hangs in the balance, you are all victims of reality poisoning. A toxic paradox. One of your own making.\nMEL: EXITS TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 140\nMEL: Doctor. Nathan’s fading fast! We need to get him somewhere. A hospital!\nDOCTOR: And I know which one. First, I need the planet shield raised. And the population freed.\nATOMON: (FX) No. They are ours...\nDOCTOR: Because if you don’t, you have one future. And only one.\nATOMON: (FX) This.. This is impossible...\nDOCTOR: Not when you have a time machine. If Nathan dies, so do you all. Perhaps I should just let it happen.\nMEL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: All right, Mel. We’ll go. But first, they leave this planet alone!\nATOMON: (FX, IN PAIN) I will commune... with the board.\nDOCTOR: I suggest you commune quickly.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 92: INT. SPEROVORE SHIP, BOARDROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: SICK-SOUNDING GLOOPY B/G. GLORIA STUMBLES IN.\nGLORIA: What’s going on? What’s wrong with you?\nSPEROVORES: (FX) Poison... Poison... Agree... Agree!\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) The agreement is ratified! We agree!\nGLORIA: What agreement?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX, STARTING TO RECOVER) What are you doing here?\nGLORIA: Me... Oh nothing. Really. Nothing at all. An accounting anomaly, but it’s all sorted out. If I could just impose for a ride to somewhere less... doomed.\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) Ricosta is reprieved.\nGLORIA: Sorry?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) We have reviewed the planetary debt situation and are prepared to offer an extension.\nGLORIA: Really?\nSPEROVORE BANKER: (FX) We have sufficient power to transfer you to Ricostan customs. Then we will be taking a business sabbatical. To recover.\nGLORIA: Customs? In that case, one more thing. I couldn’t ask for a small loan?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 93: EXT. RICOSTAN STREETS\nSPEROVORE: COMMUNICATION HUM.\nATOMON: (FX) We agree Doctor! We agree to your terms.\nDOCTOR: An absolute displeasure doing business with you.\nDOCTOR: 142\nDOCTOR: ENTERS TARDIS. DOORS CLOSE. DEMATERIALISATION STARTS.\nATOMON: (FX) We depart. Sperovore brethren! Return me! We must be\nATOMON: cured!\nTENTACLES: RETRACT. ATOMON BEAMS BACK TO SHIP.\nWILDTRACK RICOSTANS: (CRIES OF RELIEF) They’re going!/ We’re saved!\nRUMBLING: AS SPEROVORE SHIPS DEPART FROM SKIES.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 143\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 94: INT. FUTURISTIC HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR WHO: FADE UP BEEPS OF LIFE SUPPORT.\nMEL: This is the right place. The Krytomp Bio-Infirmary.\nDOCTOR: In the Golden Dragon Nebula. One of the wealthiest sectors in the galaxy. Rich pickings for anyone with criminal leanings.\nDOCTOR: But is it the right ward? Ace, who’s in the next bed?\nACE: It’s empty. (WALKING OVER) But there’s a chart. (PICKS UP CHART) Says he’s in surgery... Ohhh.\nMEL: Let me see... (TAKING CHART) An accident on a stolen hoverscooter... Ohhh.\nDOCTOR: And the name on the chart: (TAKING CHART) Sabalom Glitz. Good.\nMEL: Gloria said they’d known each other a long time.\nDOCTOR: We’re about to condemn Mr Later to a life of crime. One we know ends very badly.\nACE: But at least he gets to live. It’s the way the universe runs. We’ve got to do it. Haven’t we? (BEAT) Bilge-bag and Lefty, twenty years younger.\nDOCTOR: We all change over time...\nMEL: I’ve prepaid Nathan’s account. Courtesy of S.I. Holdings. The consultant says he needs lots of prosthetics.\nDOCTOR: We've seen them. (PICKING UP NATHAN’S CHART) The name on his chart’s blank. Let’s fill it in, shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL)\nMEL: Are you allowed to do that?\nDOCTOR: I am a Doctor. (WRITING) ‘Nathan...\nDOCTOR: Come along. Both of you.\nACE: Later, Later.\nACE: Lonnigan.’\nACE: Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 95: INT. SPEROVORE SHIP\nGLOOPING: B/G RETURNING TO NORMAL.\nDOCTOR: (VIA COMMS) I’m pleased to see you’ve left orbit.\nATOMON: (FX) You have saved the Sperovore race. The board is grateful, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (D) I didn’t do it for you. If your financial structures collapse it would cause untold misery across hundreds of worlds. Sometimes, you have to save the monsters too.\nATOMON: (FX) We are reviewing our investments. A more circumspect view may be needed. Some control of our... appetites.\nDOCTOR: (D) Yes. You never know when you might come across another paradox. Especially if I’m anywhere in the vicinity. Over and out.\nCOMMS: CUT OUT. SPEROVORE SHIP FLIES ON.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 96: INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: TARDIS IN FLIGHT B/G.\nMEL: Erm. Doctor, did you ask about my debt?\nACE: We don’t tend to think about money.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it will all be ancient history soon enough. Well done, Mel. As for you, Ace...\nACE: What about me?\nDOCTOR: I’ll speak to you about rash decisions later. Once I’ve made sure there are no further repercussions.\nACE: But-—\nDOCTOR: (USING CONTROLS) First, I need to put Mel’s old room back where we can find it. Though I suspect the TARDIS may already have it to hand.\nACE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Our last few trips. The sentimental old thing’s been following in Mel’s footsteps! She must have thought we needed her.\nACE: The TARDIS was doing all the steering? But I thought-\nMEL: You’ve been looking for me! Without even realising?\nDOCTOR: And now we’ve found you. Follow me, Mel! (EXITS INTO CORRIDOR,\nWHISTLING: ‘PEASE POTTAGE HOT’ )\nMEL: Isn’t it great? The old gang back together? (FOLLOWS DOCTOR) Doctor! Wait for me!\nACE: (UNIMPRESSED) Yeah. Just great.\nDOCTOR WHO: A LIFE OF CRIME (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 97: INT. SHUTTLE\nDOCTOR WHO: RYANAIR OF SPACE TRAVEL. CRYING CHILD.\nGLORIA: Excuse me! Isn’t there a better seat than this?\nSTEWARD: APPROACHES IN AISLE.\nSTEWARD: Sorry madam. Miss-\nGLORIA: Swannicker. Gloria Swannicker. If you check my loyalty points-\nSTEWARD: I’m afraid First class and business are full.\nGLORIA: Look. I’ve got cash-\nSTEWARD: We’re not allowed to do that. Would Madam like an economy meal?\nGLORIA: No. Thank you.\nSTEWARD: Then please fasten your safety belt. We’re about to depart.\nSTEWARD: CLUNK OF TROLLEY. CHILD CRIES LOUDER. SHUTTLE RATTLES AS IT\nMOVES: OFF.\nGLORIA: (TO SELF) I’1ll be back. Back in a better seat. A better life. Once I track you down, and take back what I’m owed. Miss Melanie Bush.\nGLORIA: THE END"
