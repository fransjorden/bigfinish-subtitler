Even hurt him a bit.\nSALLY: And you’d be prepared to do that, would you?\nRACHEL: Why not?\nSALLY: Well, for one thing we’re not in any immediate danger. And for another, Mr Soames is our only potential ally.\nRACHEL: He’s our only source of information too.\nSALLY: Except for the Master.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nRACHEL: Oh yeah. The mysterious Master. Can’t say I think much of him. Leaving us to stew in our own juices. Softening us up.\nSALLY: Or just allowing us to acclimatise before he makes his appearance?\nRACHEL: Trusting little soul, aren’t you?\nSALLY: Not at all. I just don’t automatically think the worst of every Situation.\nRACHEL: Thinking the worst is the only way to survive, darling.\nSALLY: If that’s how you think, I feel sorry for you.\nRACHEL: Don’t patronise me.\nSALLY: I’m not. I just... Look. We’re in the same situation here. Let’s stick together, shall we? Support one another?\nRACHEL: How do I know you’re not a plant? Put here to gain my trust?\nSALLY: Oh, you’re impossible!\nRACHEL: Wary, that’s all.\nSALLY: How do I know you’re not here to destabilise me?\nRACHEL: You don’t. Only I know that.\nSALLY: Exactly.\nRACHEL: Okay. We’1ll stick together. But that doesn’t mean we have to trust each other. Agreed?\nSALLY: Agreed.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nRACHEL: What’s that?\nSALLY: The lift! Must mean someone’s in it. Come on, let’s check it\nSALLY: out.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DESCENDING WHIRR/CLANK OF THE LIFT, LOUDER NOW. FADE IN SALLY AND RACHEL’S APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS )\nSALLY: (RUNNING UP) At last. It was further away than I thought.\nRACHEL: (BEHIND) Quick, press the button or the lift won’t stop.\nRACHEL: (FX: SALLY’S RUNNING, THUMPING FOOTSTEPS. SHE REACHES THE LIFT, HITS THE BUTTON)\nSALLY: (PANTING) Made it!\nRACHEL: Nice one.\nSALLY: We'll have to open the gate ourselves. (EFFORT) Give me a hand, will you? This is really stiff.\nSALLY: (FX: BOTH GIRLS GRUNT AND GASP AS THEY HAUL OPEN AN OLD- FASHIONED, CONCERTINA-LIKE LIFT GATE, WHICH CLANKS RUSTILY)\nRACHEL: Empty! After all that!\nSALLY: Filthy, too. Looks as though it hasn’t been used in years. Except...\nRACHEL: Except what?\nSALLY: Look there. Footprints in the dust. Flat shoes. A man’s, possibly.\nRACHEL: Probably just Soames.\nSALLY: Well, whoever it was, they must have got out higher up and then sent the lift down.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nRACHEL: Don’t sound too healthy, does it?\nSALLY: I think sticking to the stairs might be the safest option.\nRACHEL: (TEASING) Not scared, are yer?\nSALLY: No. Just careful. Let’s close this and move on.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOWNSTAIRS, CLOCK STRIKES ONCE FOR HALF-HOUR. FADE UP THE GIRLS’ FOOTSTEPS )\nSALLY: Half-past five.\nRACHEL: Is that all? (STOPPING) It’s so piggin’ gloomy. Is there a way of making these gas lamps any brighter?\nSALLY: There should be a little wheel on the side.\nRACHEL: Well, that makes a big difference. Blimey, it’s like we’ve been thrown back to the Dark Ages.\nSALLY: Maybe we have.\nRACHEL: Hey, look at this. Spooky old mirror. (SPOOKY VOICE) Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all? (PAUSE) Guess not me, then.\nSALLY: (THOUGHTFULLY) It’s interesting, isn’t it?\nRACHEL: What is?\nSALLY: What we do and don’t remember. I’m guessing you remember what year it is?\nRACHEL: Course. 2020.\nSALLY: Right. So you remember cities and cars and people? And politics and news, things like that?\nRACHEL: Yeah.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nSALLY: But can you remember where you live? Can you remember members of your family? What you ate for your last meal, even?\nRACHEL: No...\nSALLY: So what we can remember is the infrastructure, the mechanics, of the society we live in, but not our place within it. For instance, I can easily picture.. a meadow on a sunny day. A football crowd. People eating in a restaurant. But I can’t relate any of those images to my personal experiences. As far as I’m concerned, I’m a.. void.\nRACHEL: So what does that mean?\nSALLY: I don’t know. Maybe we don’t exist.\nRACHEL: Don’t be soft. Course we exist! We’re here, aren’t we? My heart’s beating. If I pinch myself, it hurts.\nSALLY: (STOPPING) You know what frightens me more than anything? Being forgotten. I have this fear that one day I’1ll wake up and no- one will be able to see or hear me. I’1l just be... gone.\nRACHEL: That won’t happen.\nSALLY: How do you know? We’re half-way there already. We have no focal point, no identity.\nRACHEL: We have an identity. We just haven’t found it yet.\nSALLY: But what if we never find it?\nRACHEL: We will.\nSALLY: But what if we don’t?\nRACHEL: Look, just — keep calm, carry on. Let’s try some of these doors, shall we? (FX: TWISTS DOORKNOB. DOOR CREAKS OPEN INTO:)\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nRACHEL: Blimey, look at this!\nSALLY: It’s an operating theatre.\nRACHEL: In a hotel? What the hell’s going on?\nRACHEL: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ON TILED FLOOR AS SALLY CROSSES TO A SINK. SHE\nPICKS: UP A METAL TRAY, WHICH RATTLES WITH SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS )\nSALLY: There’s blood on these instruments. Fresh blood.\nRACHEL: Nice. (FX: CREAK AS SHE LIFTS A METAL LID) Check out the waste bin. There’s blood on these scrubs, too. Remember what I said before? About experiments?\nSALLY: (SHUDDERS) Brrr...\nRACHEL: You all right? Bit freaked out?\nSALLY: It’s not that. Didn’t you feel it?\nRACHEL: Feel what?\nSALLY: Something cold. It just... brushed by me.\nRACHEL: A draught, you mean? Got to expect it, old house like this. No central heating.\nSALLY: It didn’t feel like a draught.\nRACHEL: So what’re you saying? That it was a ghost? (SPOOKY VOICE) Reaching out from beyond the grave with icy fingers?\nSALLY: Don’t make fun of me.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nRACHEL: Well, you got to admit, it’s a bit of a cliché. You’1l be seeing things next. Hearing unexplained noises.\nRACHEL: (FX: OFF/OUTSIDE IN THE CORRIDOR — MUFFLED, CHILD-LIKE GIGGLING, AS BEFORE, THOUGH SLURRED, DISTORTED, SINISTER)\nSALLY: Like those, you mean?\nRACHEL: Yeah. What the hell —\nSALLY: Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nRACHEL: There’s nothing here. Which direction did it come from?\nSALLY: Down the corridor, look! Door closing!\nSALLY: (FX: A DOOR FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR CLOSES WITH A SHARP BUT\nSTEALTHY: CLICK)\nRACHEL: (ANGRILY) Someone’s mucking us about!\nRACHEL: Oi, you in there!\nSALLY: (MUTTERS) Open sesame.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THEIR FOOTSTEPS ECHO HOLLOWLY ON A TILED FLOOR AS THEY ENTER)\nSALLY: (SURPRISED) It’s a swimming pool! At least... I’m guessing there’s water under all those leaves.\nRACHEL: (CLEARLY ON EDGE) Well, there’s obviously nothing here. Let’s\nRACHEL: go.\nSALLY: What do you mean? We’ve barely had time for a proper look around.\nRACHEL: (NERVOUSNESS MAKING HER ANGRY) What’s to see? A big empty room with a swimming pool in the middle. Big deal.\nSALLY: Something made that noise we heard.\nRACHEL: It must’ve come from another room. Come on, we’re wasting our time here.\nSALLY: Another room? We saw the door close. We ought to at least have a poke about under these leaves. Pass me that net, would you?\nRACHEL: (SCATHINGLY) You honestly think there’s something hiding in the water?\nSALLY: It’s possible. Besides, we don’t know for certain that there’s any water in there, do we?\nSALLY: (FX: SHE POKES AT THE LEAFY SURFACE OF THE POOL. THE POLE\nSPLATS: THROUGH INTO WATER)\nSALLY: Okay, so there is water in there. (FX: SHE RAISES THE POLE. WATER AND SLIME DRIPS FROM IT, ON TO THE LAYER OF LEAVES) Ugh. Pretty rank. Look at all that slime.\nRACHEL: (ANXIOUSLY) Nothing could survive under there. Let’s go.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nSALLY: You know what’s weird?\nRACHEL: What?\nSALLY: Where are the leaves from? I mean, if this was an outdoor pool it would make sense. But this room is sealed up tight. There isn’t even a door leading onto a terrace.\nRACHEL: Does it matter?\nSALLY: It might.\nRACHEL: Look, nothing makes sense here. We’ve already established that. Let’s just go.\nSALLY: (SIGHS) Okay. I suppose you’re right that no-one could hide under there. Not for as long as we’ve been in the room anyway.\nSALLY: (FX: A SUDDEN DOUBLE-SPLASH, AS OF SOMETHING BRIEFLY BREAKING THE SURFACE BEFORE SUBMERGING AGAIN)\nSALLY: What was that?\nRACHEL: (RISING ANXIETY) Nothing.\nSALLY: It was definitely something.\nRACHEL: Just an air bubble. Come on. (FX: SHE STOMPS AWAY)\nSALLY: (SCEPTICAL) An air bubble? (FOLLOWING) Hey, hang about —\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nRACHEL: Which way now, d’you think?\nSALLY: I think this place is... strange. Corridors leading on and on, twisting round and around [and —]\nRACHEL: (SEES SOMETHING) That wasn’t here.\nSALLY: What?\nRACHEL: Words, on the wall — see? They weren’t here when we went into the pool room.\nSALLY: You’re sure-?\nRACHEL: (READING) ‘You Are Mine’. (POINTING) Same there. And there. On the ceiling, even.\nSALLY: (QUIETLY) Whoever it was did this, they didn’t write it.\nRACHEL: What do you mean?\nSALLY: These words have been burned into the plaster.\nRACHEL: Burned? How?\nSALLY: I don’t know. With a blowtorch, [maybe?]\nSALLY: (FX: INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD BANG FROM DOWN CORRIDOR — OPEN\nWINDOW: BANGING AGAINST FRAME)\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: RACHEL/ SALLY\nRACHEL: (BARK OF LAUGHTER) It’s okay. It’s just the window down the end there, look.\nSALLY: (WALKING) Perhaps whoever did all this —\nRACHEL: (WALKING) Climbed in and out of the window? (STOPPING) We’re four flights up now —\nSALLY: (EXCLAMATION, LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW) Hey! Then who’s that?\nRACHEL: What?\nSALLY: Some bloke. On the path there.\nRACHEL: Oi! You down there! (BEAT) No use, he’s gone. Disappeared round the side of the house. Did you get a proper look at him?\nSALLY: Only for a second. Dark jacket. White hat. Didn’t look like\nSALLY: Soames.\nSALLY: Come on. Let’s check it out.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. WIND; SCRAPE AND RUSTLE OF FOLIAGE. THE CLUNK OF A LATCH AND A CREAK AS THE MAIN DOOR OPENS)\nSALLY: It’s freezing out here.\nRACHEL: Come on!\nRACHEL: (FX: CRACKLING, RAPID FOOTSTEPS AS THEY HURRY ALONG THE\nOVERGROWN: PATH THAT SNAKES AROUND THE HOUSE. EVENTUALLY\nFOOTSTEPS: SLOW, STOP)\nRACHEL: (PANTING) I think this is where we saw him. Yeah, there’s the window of the room we were in.\nSALLY: (PANTING) You’re sure?\nRACHEL: Pretty sure. It’s one of that row anyway. I recognise this tree.\nSALLY: This place might be run-down, but it’s huge. I wish I knew where we were.\nRACHEL: Maybe there’s a library or something inside, with books on the local area.\nSALLY: Maybe. (PAUSE) Well, there’s no sign of our mysterious man. Maybe he went back into the hotel.\nRACHEL: Or he could’ve gone to ground. For all we know, he might be watching us right now.\nSALLY: Comforting thought. Shall we head back?\nRACHEL: Let’s walk all the way round. We might learn something.\nRACHEL: (FX: THEIR FOOTSTEPS RESUME; MORE LEISURELY NOW. OFF/HIGH ABOVE — A SUDDEN LOUD CRACKLING FLASH, LIKE A FIERY BURST OF\nELECTRICITY: )\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nRACHEL: Did you see that?\nSALLY: I saw something. Lightning?\nRACHEL: No, it came from inside.\nSALLY: Inside?\nRACHEL: Up there. Top of that turret. Huge flash of blue light at the window.\nSALLY: An explosion maybe?\nRACHEL: No, it was more like... oh, I dunno... a camera flash or something.\nSALLY: Hell of a camera.\nRACHEL: Well, maybe it was a telly blowing up.\nSALLY: No electricity, remember.\nRACHEL: (EXASPERATED SIGH) All right, Miss Smartypants. What do you think it was?\nSALLY: (HALF-JOKINGLY) Maybe there is a mad scientist up there.\nRACHEL: (HESITANTLY) I think... No, it don’t matter.\nSALLY: What?\nRACHEL: When the light flashed, I saw something else. At the window. A figure.\nSALLY: A person, you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nRACHEL: Maybe.\nSALLY: Well... was it or wasn’t it?\nRACHEL: I dunno. There was something weird about it.\nSALLY: In what way?\nRACHEL: It was only in silhouette. Back-lit, so maybe I didn’t see it clearly. But it looked.. too tall for a normal person. And too thin. And its hands and head looked long and narrow, as if they’d been stretched. (SNORTS A NERVOUS LAUGH) Like I say, I didn’t get a proper look.\nSALLY: Did it seem male or female?\nRACHEL: Male maybe? The head looked smooth. Bald.\nSALLY: (DECISIVELY) Come on. Let’s find the nearest door and go back\nSALLY: inside.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nRACHEL: Something smells good.\nSALLY: Mr Soames did say that dinner was at seven. This must be it.\nSALLY: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ON TILED FLOOR AS RACHEL CROSSES THE ROOM. SCRAPE OF A METAL BUCKET ON A WOODEN TABLE AS SHE DRAGS IT CLOSER AND TILTS IT. FISH GUTS SLOP HEAVILY INSIDE)\nRACHEL: Judging by this bucketful of guts, we’re having fish.\nSALLY: (RUEFULLY) Yum.\nRACHEL: So what’s in the pot? Severed head? Pet rabbit?\nRACHEL: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ON TILES AS SALLY CROSSES TO THE COOKER. FADE UP SOUND OF BUBBLING POT)\nSALLY: Potatoes. (FX: OFF — THE ‘ZING’ OF STEEL ON STEEL AS RACHEL EXTRACTS A KNIFE FROM A METAL RACK ON THE WALL) Hey, what are you doing?\nRACHEL: Taking one of these knives.\nSALLY: What for?\nRACHEL: Defend myself with.\nSALLY: Defend yourself against what?\nRACHEL: Who knows? That thing in the tower room maybe.\nSALLY: (LAUGHS) You’re paranoid, you know that?\nRACHEL: Take my advice, darling. Always be prepared.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nSALLY: But you can’t just go round stealing things.\nRACHEL: Who’s gonna know? Hardly a case of too many cooks in here, is\nRACHEL: af wis\nRACHEL: (FX: A BELL TINKLES, ONE OF A ROW OF SMALL SERVANTS’ BELLS ON THE WALL)\nSALLY: (SNIGGERS) You rang m’lud?\nRACHEL: Come on, let’s scarper before we’re rumbled. See if we can find\nRACHEL: this tower.\nRACHEL: (FX: FOOTSTEPS ON TILES AS THEY CROSS TO THE INTERNAL DOOR. AFTER A FEW STEPS THE BELL TINKLES AGAIN)\nRACHEL: Someone’s impatient.\nSALLY: Very impatient. I wonder if-\nSALLY: (FX: SUDDENLY ALL THE BELLS START RINGING AT ONCE, A HIDEOUS CACOPHONY, DROWNING OUT HER WORDS)\nRACHEL: (SHOUTING) What the hell’s this? Fire drill?\nSALLY: (SHOUTING) Let’s get out before they drive us mad.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nRACHEL: (TRUDGING TO HALT) Listen. Half-six.\nSALLY: Soon be dinner time.\nRACHEL: (SUDDEN FRUSTRATION) Oh, this is insane! How can that tower not exist?\nSALLY: It does exist. We know it exists because we’ve seen it.\nRACHEL: But we've looked everywhere. I’m sick of the sight of corridors and staircases.\nSALLY: There must be a route we haven’t discovered yet, that’s all. We just have to be methodical.\nRACHEL: Easier said than done. This place is a maze. We’re like rats chasing our tails.\nSALLY: (RELUCTANTLY) Maybe...\nRACHEL: Maybe what?\nSALLY: I hate to say this, but maybe the tower’s only accessible via the lift.\nRACHEL: You want to try it?\nSALLY: Do you?\nRACHEL: I’m game if you are.\nSALLY: From what I remember, it’s back this way. (FX: THEY EXIT. FADE)\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nSALLY: Oh.\nRACHEL: What?\nSALLY: It doesn’t seem to be working.\nRACHEL: Press the button again.\nSALLY: I’ve pressed it once.\nRACHEL: Well, press it harder. Here, let me.\nSALLY: You see?\nRACHEL: Damn thing. It’s like it knows what we’re up to. It’s like the whole house knows, and it’s working against us. Playing with us.\nSALLY: You’re being paranoid.\nRACHEL: Oh, am I?\nSALLY: Well, listen to yourself. You’re suggesting that the house is somehow... alive. Intelligent.\nRACHEL: All right, well maybe it’s not the house then. But someone somewhere is watching us. Manipulating us. Take it from me, darling, someone means us harm.\nSALLY: You’re such a pessimist.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nRACHEL: No, I’m a realist. You should try it sometime.\nRACHEL: (FX: OFF/DISTANT — FIST BANGING ON WOOD; CLANG OF THE FRONT\nDOOR: BELL)\nSALLY: Someone’s arrived.\nRACHEL: (NON-PLUSSED) Whoopee. Hope they’ve brought a bottle. We can have a party.\nSALLY: Come on, let’s say hello.\nRACHEL: (MUTTERS) Yeah, let’s.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nSOAMES: (TO TOBY, BEING MENACED) I already told you, gentlemen — the Master will explain [everything] —\nTOBY: Everything, yeah. Only I don’t feel like waiting. Cough up, you ghastly old retainer!\nJEROME: What is this place? What’s going on?\nSALLY: (FX: FROM OFF, DESCENDING STAIRS) Hey! You two! No need for the rough stuff!\nTOBY: (FLIRTING) Well, hello there, gorgeous. And who might you be?\nSALLY: (FX: STEPPING OFF STAIRS, WALKING FORWARD) No idea. Number 18?\nTOBY: Right. Well, delighted to meet you, 18. Apparently I’m 12 and this chap here is 16.\nJEROME: Hi.\nSALLY: You arrived together?\nTOBY: In a manner of speaking.\nTOBY: (FX: CREAK OF RACHEL’S FOOTSTEPS AS SHE DESCENDS THE STAIRS\nBEHIND: SALLY)\nRACHEL: Do you two know each other?\nTOBY: My cup runneth over. Is this place full of beautiful women?\nRACHEL: Just answer the question, pal.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nJEROME: We met a few minutes ago.\nTOBY: What 16 means is that he sneaked up on me. Nearly gave me a coronary.\nJEROME: I didn’t sneak. I saw you on the path ahead. I called out.\nSALLY: Can either of you remember how you got here?\nTOBY: Not a clue. Must’ve been one hell of a party.\nRACHEL: You a moron or what?\nTOBY: Hmm. I think you need to work on those chat-up lines, sweetheart.\nJEROME: Where are we? What’s going on?\nSALLY: We don’t know.\nRACHEL: (RAISING HER VOICE) Why don’t you try asking him? Mr Sinister Soames, lurking in the corner?\nSOAMES: (OFF; ACROSS THE HALLWAY) As I’ve already explained, Miss, I’m not at liberty to —\nRACHEL: I don’t care whether you’re at ‘liberty’ or not, pal. I’m sick and tired of being given the runaround. Grab him, boys!\nTOBY: That’s more like it. I do love a commanding woman.\nSALLY: No. No! I already said!\nRACHEL: Sorry, 18. Hold him there!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nSOAMES: Please... I can’t tell you anything.\nRACHEL: I think you can. (FX: PUNCHES SOAMES IN GUT)\nTOBY: (WINCING) Ooh.\nSALLY: 5th)\nJEROME: Yeah, go easy, girl.\nRACHEL: Come on, Mr Soames. Talk.\nSOAMES: (IN PAIN) I can’t...\nRACHEL: You can and you will.\nSALLY: Or what? You’1l torture him?\nRACHEL: We have a right to know what’s happening here.\nTOBY: You tell ‘em, sweetheart.\nSOAMES: I can’t tell you anything. If I did, it would place us all in jeopardy.\nRACHEL: We just want to know what you know.\nSOAMES: Please... The Master will tell you as much as he can.\nRACHEL: So why doesn’t this precious Master show himself? Why is he keeping us waiting?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 37 (FX: RIGHT ON CUE A CLOCK BEGINS STRIKING SEVEN.

What’s so terrible that we’re better off not knowing about it?\nRACHEL: Isn’t it obvious what he’s doing? He’s on some sort of power yo ag oe\nDOCTOR: It’s a question of power, certainly. But not mine.\nRACHEL: Stop talking in riddles. What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: All I can tell you is that something ancient and foul has emerged from the wilderness and drawn you to this house. And that speaking of it will only strengthen it.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 43\nSALLY: What do you mean, ‘drawn’ us here?\nDOCTOR: I’ve said too much already. You’1ll just have to trust me for now.\nRACHEL: Why should we do that?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m the only one who can help you.\nTOBY: And what’s to stop us walking out of here right now?\nDOCTOR: There’s nowhere to go.\nRACHEL: We'll see about that. (FX: SCRAPE OF CHAIR AS SHE STANDS UP) Who’s with me?\nTOBY: Count me in, sweetheart.\nDOCTOR: Why don’t you humans ever listen?\nRACHEL: ‘You humans’? So what are you? A super hero?\nDOCTOR: It’s imperative that you stay together.\nRACHEL: We will — as long as we’re all going in the same direction. You two coming?\nSALLY: No, I’m staying here.\nRACHEL: Don’t tell me you believe this weirdo?\nSALLY: I don’t know. But we’ve seen and heard plenty here we can’t explain.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nRACHEL: Magic tricks. I can’t believe you’re so gullible.\nTOBY: What about you, soldier?\nJEROME: Why d’you call me that?\nTOBY: Just a turn of phrase. You coming or not?\nJEROME: No. I think I’1ll stay here too.\nRACHEL: Please yourselves. Well? Not going to try and stop us, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Your minds are clearly made up.\nRACHEL: You got that right. Well... see you around. Or not.\nTOBY: Yes, cheerio. Have fun.\nTOBY: (FX: THEY MOVE AWAY; OPEN THE MAIN DOOR WITH A CREAK; BANG IT\nSHUT: BEHIND THEM)\nSALLY: What will they find out there, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Disappointment. Confusion.

A good chat to jog the old brainbox, grease the cogs as it were...\nTOBY: Something the matter?\nRACHEL: Call me ‘sweetheart’ one more time, and I’1l1 swing for you.\nTOBY: Duly noted. (WALKS) So what shall I call you? ‘5’?\nRACHEL: (WALKING) Don’t call me anything.\nTOBY: (WALKING) Bit unfriendly.\nRACHEL: (STOPS) I’m not interested in making friends. I just want to get out of here and find out who I am.\nTOBY: (STOPPED) Me too. But there’s nothing to stop us being civil. We are in the same boat, after all.\nRACHEL: We might be deadly enemies in real life.\nTOBY: Or husband and wife. Have you thought about that?\nRACHEL: God forbid.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 46\nTOBY: Oh, thanks a bunch. (PAUSE) Look, I meant what I said... about talking, I mean.\nRACHEL: (SIGH) Okay then — talk.\nTOBY: All right. Where to start?\nRACHEL: Tell me about your phobia. Mirrors, isn’t it?\nTOBY: Yes.\nRACHEL: What is it about them that frightens you?\nTOBY: Well... I know it sounds loopy, but I’ve always had this idea that if I look into a mirror I’1ll see someone else looking back at me. Someone who isn’t me, I mean. Either that, ovr...\nRACHEL: Or?\nTOBY: . or that I’1l see something standing behind me. Something terrible.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TICKING OF GRANDFATHER CLOCK; SCRAPE AND CLATTER OF CUTLERY /CROCKERY )\nSOAMES: Beef or trout, sir?\nDOCTOR: Trout, I think, Mr Soames. Stimulates the brain cells.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ‘TINK’ OF SERVING TONGS AGAINST CHINA AS SOAMES TRANSFERS A PORTION OF FISH FROM PLATTER TO PLATE)\nSOAMES: And for you, miss?\nSALLY: (DISTRACTED) Er... yes, I’1l have the trout too. Look, what is this, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It smells like a ginger and rosemary sauce, unless I’m much mistaken.\nSALLY: I don’t mean the food. I mean why are we just sitting here? Having dinner?\nDOCTOR: Aren’t you hungry?\nJEROME: (TO SOAMES) Beef, mate. Cheers.\nSOAMES: Sir. (FX: SERVING THROUGH: )\nSALLY: That’s beside the point! You talked about something ancient and foul coming out of the wilderness. You intimated we were about to come under attack. Shouldn’t we be doing something? Trying to escape like the others?\nDOCTOR: A pointless exercise. (BEGINS EATING) Eat, eat!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nJEROME: I don’t get it. You said you were here to rescue us.\nDOCTOR: (MOUTH FULL) And so I am.\nJEROME: But how can you rescue us if there’s no escape?\nDOCTOR: I’m waiting for a door to open.\nSALLY: What kind of door?\nDOCTOR: I’1l know it when I see it.\nSALLY: You have no idea what you’re doing, do you?\nDOCTOR: Of course I know what I’m doing! (PAUSE) I’m just not entirely sure what I’1l be doing five minutes from now. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that it pays to be flexible.\nJEROME: So this foul and ancient thing? Is it on its way?\nDOCTOR: It’s already here.\nJEROME: (NERVOUSLY) Really?\nSALLY: Where is it?\nDOCTOR: In the shadows. Biding its time.\nSALLY: Why doesn’t it attack?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m here. And it doesn’t know what I am. Yet.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nTOBY: What about you? Your fear of water?\nRACHEL: It’s something I’ve learned to live with.\nTOBY: So it’s drowning you’re afraid of?\nRACHEL: It wouldn’t be a phobia if it was that simple. (PAUSE) Water makes me anxious. It’s like a predator without a face, a killer without mercy. I hate the way it moves. It’s... muscular. Sinewy. It just keeps going, no matter what.\nTOBY: It’s running water you don’t like, then?\nRACHEL: No. Its stillness bothers me too. It’s like it’s waiting. The fact that you can’t see beneath the surface — as if it’s hiding something.\nTOBY: Keeping clean must be tricky.\nRACHEL: (SNAPS) Are you making fun of me?\nTOBY: Absolutely not. You’re looking at a man who can’t shave without getting the sweats, remember.\nRACHEL: (SUBDUED LAUGH) I can manage showers. But not baths — and definitely not swimming pools. Under the water it’s another world. Heavy and airless and dark. I get breathless just talking about it...\nTOBY: Best not then. Let’s change the subject.\nRACHEL: But it makes me angry. It’s irrational, stupid. Besides, this is what we should be talking about. It’s the only thing that\nRACHEL: defines us here. How long have you had your fear of mirrors?\nRACHEL: Where does it come from?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nTOBY: No idea.\nRACHEL: Have you ever seen anything in a mirror? Anything that frightened you?\nTOBY: (ANXIOUS) I’m not sure... I can’t remember.\nTOBY: (FX: OFF/DISTANT, LOUD RUSTLE OF WIND THROUGH THE TREES — BUT\nSUBTLY: DISTORTED...

(RELUCTANTLY) It sounded like water. Just for a second. (NERVOUS LAUGH) This place must be getting to me.\nTOBY: How far have we come, do you think?\nRACHEL: Dunno. A mile?

A flash of movement.\nRACHEL: A person, you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nTOBY: I’m not sure. It looked... silvery. Formless but fast. It seemed to reflect the light.\nRACHEL: (SPOOKED) Like water?\nTOBY: (ALSO SPOOKED) Or glass...\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TICKING OF GRANDFATHER CLOCK; SCRAPE AND CLATTER OF CUTLERY/CROCKERY AS THEY EAT)\nSALLY: What are you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: To our friend?

(FX: SETS CUTLERY ON PLATE) Thank you, Soames.\nSOAMES: (WALKING FORWARD) Sir.\nSALLY: You’re saying you’re, I don’t know, bait?\nDOCTOR: More of a distraction.

Oh... yeah.\nSOAMES: In that case, I’1ll take your plate, if I may?\nJEROME: Go for it.\nJEROME: (FX: SOAMES PICKS UP THE PLATE — AND A COCKROACH EMERGES FROM\nBENEATH IT: RAPID, CLICKING, SCUTTLING LEGS.

It ran right across the table and over the side. (SHUDDER OF REVULSION)\nSALLY: What did? What was it?\nJEROME: A cockroach. A great big cockroach.\nDOCTOR: It’s started.\nSALLY: What has? The attack, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes. What you saw wasn’t real, Mr 16.\nJEROME: It so was.\nDOCTOR: It might look real. It might even feel real. But it’s a manifestation of your fear, lifted directly from your mind. You must fight it. Deny it. (FX: SCRAPE OF CHAIR AS THE DOCTOR STANDS) Stay here.\nSALLY: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Our enemy has come out into the open. That makes it vulnerable.\nSALLY: Yes, but where are you going, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hunting!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: RUSTLE OF FOLIAGE; SNAP AND CRACKLE OF BRANCHES THROUGH SCENE AS RACHEL AND TOBY STRUGGLE TO MAKE HEADWAY )\nRACHEL: (PRICKED) Ow! These thorns. They’re lethal.\nTOBY: Let’s hope not. (GRUNTS AS HE TRIES TO HACK A WAY THROUGH) It would help if we could find some open ground. But it’s all so wild.\nRACHEL: Just tangles of brambles and nettles and dead trees. No walls or fields, no sound of traffic... What was it that Doctor said? That there was nowhere to go? Maybe he meant it literally. Maybe we’re dead and this is limbo...\nTOBY: And that little Doctor chap is the Devil Incarnate, eh?\nRACHEL: Who knows?\nRACHEL: (FX: OFF/HIGH UP, THE BRIEF RUSHING, WAVE-LIKE SOUND AGAIN; LOUD AND SUDDEN, WITH A SENSE OF MOVEMENT, OF FLOWING FROM ONE SET OF TREES TO ANOTHER)\nRACHEL: That sound again. It came from behind us.\nTOBY: Just wind in the treetops.\nRACHEL: So how come the treetops aren’t moving?\nTOBY: It comes and goes. Nothing odd about that. Shall we press on or look for another route?\nRACHEL: (SIGHS) I don’t think we’ll get through here. What time is it, do you reckon?\nTOBY: Haven’t a clue.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nRACHEL: Impossible to tell by the sky. It just looks grey.\nTOBY: Well, at least that proves we’re still in England. Come on, old girl, chin up. Best foot forward.\nRACHEL: Hang on. Look. Through the trees there. What’s that?\nTOBY: (GRUNTING) Let me just... trample down this... damn bush. (FX:\nTRAMPLING: SOUNDS) Well, I’1l be jiggered.. It’s a maze! A big one too. Looks like this isn’t an unchartered wilderness, after all.\nRACHEL: Never liked mazes. Creepy things.\nTOBY: Is that a specific memory breaking through?\nRACHEL: No. Just a gut reaction.\nTOBY: Might be a clue to your past, though.

Yes, yes, I remember now.\nSOAMES: (UNCERTAINLY) Doctor, are you all right?\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY; DOOM-LADEN) Dr Soames. I seem to have made a terrible mistake.\nSOAMES: (HESITANTLY) A mistake? What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: How long was I out?\nSOAMES: Ninety minutes? But you began to convulse ten minutes ago.\nEVE: Your readings went through the roof. We thought we’d lost you.\nSOAMES: We severed your link with the system and transferred you to here — whereupon you began to stabilise quickly, thank goodness.\nDOCTOR: (URGENT) The test subjects.

All personnel, aside from myself and the test subjects, must leave.\nSOAMES: I’1ll do it, Doctor. But this is my project.

How long will it take to revive them?\nSOAMES: Not long. But I’d advise against it. You’ve read the report of what happens when they’re conscious?\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes. The subjects show evidence of increased psychic activity.\nEVE: More than that, Doctor. The subjects have been unable to break the psychic link to the Bluefire system. As a result they become distressed, resulting in -\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) .. destructive psychic manifestations. I know.\nSOAMES: To put it bluntly, Doctor, things fly about. The subjects become uncontrollable.\nEVE: Awake, they’re a danger to themselves and to us, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: They’re far more dangerous asleep, believe me.\nSOAMES: How so?\nDOCTOR: Let me ask you a question, Dr Soames. If you were at home, with all your doors and windows open, and you heard that an escaped tiger was prowling the area, what would you do?\nSOAMES: I’d close all the doors and windows.\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nSOAMES: I don’t follow.\nEVE: I think I do. You’re saying that the unconscious minds of the test subjects are wide open to attack?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nEVE: Attack from what?\nDOCTOR: First things first. Let’s shut out the tiger.\nSOAMES: All right.

The mental faculties of your test subjects are unimpared.\nSOAMES: Your assessment criteria are hardly scientific, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I tend to find that cutting a few corners invariably results in a more interesting journey.\nSOAMES: This is highly irresponsible! We have no idea of the manner or extent of the psychological trauma that may have resulted from the subjects’ exposure to the system.\nDOCTOR: And that’s your primary concern, is it? The welfare of your test subjects?\nSOAMES: (WARILY) Of course.\nDOCTOR: How philanthropic of you. And here’s me thinking you might be more concerned about the fate of your ‘experiment’.\nEVE: That’s unfair, Doctor. Dr Soames has put a huge amount of work into this project. The prior research was exhaustive, the safety procedures rigorously checked and re-checked.\nSOAMES: There was no indication whatsoever that Bluefire would have a detrimental psychological effect on its subjects. In fact, such an outcome was deemed impossible.\nDOCTOR: (COLDLY) And yet it happened. Miss Morgan? Sally?\nSALLY: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: What were you told about the Bluefire Project before you volunteered for it?\nSOAMES: We didn’t withhold information, if that’s what you’re insinuating.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR: I should like to hear what Sally has to say.\nSALLY: (HESITANTLY) They asked for army volunteers with specific phobias. We were told that the object of the research was to identify and isolate those phobias, so they might be.. I don’t know, extracted?\nDOCTOR: Except that instead of creating fearless warriors, Bluefire caused psychic instability. So much so that the test subjects’ destructive urges could only be curtailed by heavy sedation.\nEVE: There were twenty-four volunteers in all, Doctor. Twenty completed the process with no ill-effects whatsoever.\nDOCTOR: (COLDLY) Those odds were still unacceptable.\nSOAMES: We’re trying to isolate and eradicate fear here, Doctor. Isn’t that a worthwhile pursuit?\nDOCTOR: Not if the sole purpose is to create more efficient killers.\nSOAMES: The purpose is to prevent young people like these succumbing to a potentially debilitating emotion. One which, in battle, might prove to be the difference between life and death.\nDOCTOR: Hasn’t it ever occurred to you, Dr Soames, that fear can be a positive emotion? Take away fear and people lose their sense of self-preservation.\nSOAMES: If that’s true, then it can be countered through training, discipline.\nDOCTOR: So you still maintain that your intentions are philanthropic?\nSOAMES: To a large extent, yes.\nDOCTOR: And does that include your research into the application of R.E.P. technology?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 85\nJEROME: R. E. what?\nSOAMES: (FX: PULLING CURTAINS FROM AROUND A BED) Doctor — a word in\nSOAMES: private, if you would?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR: ‘Nurse, the screens!’\nSOAMES: (SOTTO) Remote Emotional Programming technology is highly classified, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: ‘Fear bullets’, I believe you call them?\nSOAMES: (SOTTO) That phrase was not of my choosing.\nDOCTOR: Then it isn’t your aim to extract the fear from the minds of your own soldiers, so you can shoot those fears into the minds of others?\nSOAMES: (SOTTO) That is a gross over-simplification —\nDOCTOR: To cripple entire nations with acute psychological trauma? Not just tyrants and soldiers, but innocent people going about their daily lives?\nEVE: (ENTERING) Dr Soames, I’m concerned [that-]\nSOAMES: One moment, please, Miss Pritchard-!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. They all heard everything.\nEVE: . I’m concerned that we have more important matters to attend to.\nDOCTOR: Quite right, Miss Pritchard.\nEVE: You mentioned an ‘enemy’? An outside influence infiltrating the system?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR: The Mi’en Kalarash, yes.\nSOAMES: And what’s that when it’s at home?\nDOCTOR: I’1ll explain as I work. Shall we go?\nEVE: Go where?\nDOCTOR: To the heart of the operation, of course.

I also remember that none of us knew who we were or how we’d got there.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You were brought together.\nTOBY: By you?\nDOCTOR: No. I simply constructed the battleground.\nTOBY: I’m sorry. I’m flummoxed. Is anyone actually following this?\nSALLY: You mean you constructed Bluefire House? You... created it with your mind?\nDOCTOR: I entered the system to rescue you.

Way to go.\nDOCTOR: My raw materials were limited. And I had... opposition.\nEVE: This ‘Mi’en Kalarash’ you mentioned?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR: Yes.

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS FROM PARTS ONE/TWO, ALL WITH\nREVERSE ECHO: )\nSALLY: [FROM SCENE 8: ] I have this fear that one day I’ll wake up and no-one will be able to see or hear me. I’ll just be... gone.\nTOBY: [FROM SCENE 21: ]\nTOBY: [..] I’ve always had this idea that if I look into a mirror I’1ll see someone else looking back at me.\nRACHEL: [FROM SCENE 23: ]\nRACHEL: Under the water it’s another world. Heavy and airless and dark. I get breathless just talking about it...\nJEROME: [FROM SCENE 25: ] A cockroach. A great big cockroach.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nSALLY: But what is it, this ‘Mi’en Kalarash’?\nDOCTOR: A legend. A scary bedtime story. In the ancient mythology of my people there are tales of an entity that inhabits the wastelands between realities, feeding on nightmares.\nJEROME: And you reckon that’s what’s got inside our heads?\nDOCTOR: It has infiltrated your minds through the Bluefire system, yes.\nJEROME: How?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nRACHEL: But this is mental. I mean — time machines, aliens, evil entities! Are you for real?\nSALLY: Shush, Rachel. (ADDRESSING THE DOCTOR) She has got a point, though, Doctor. Even accepting what we’ve seen, this does seem pretty... far-fetched. What makes you think this ‘entity’ has got into the Bluefire system?\nDOCTOR: Where I come from there is an ancient language known as Old High Gallifeyan. And in Old High Gallifreyan, ‘Mi’en Kalarash’ translates as ‘Blue Fire’.\nTOBY: Sorry, but it still sounds loopy to me.\nRACHEL: Loopy or not, it looks like we’re stuck with it. So what happens next?\nDOCTOR: I re-route the Bluefire system into the TARDIS and connect it to the Vortex Manipulator.\nRACHEL: Does that actually mean anything?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) It means I’m constructing a temporal trap. If I can capture and contain the Kalarash, I can use my TARDIS to send it back into the wastelands.\nSALLY: And will that work?\nDOCTOR: It has to. I thought that I could enter the Bluefire system, rescue the four of you and find a way to banish the Kalarash from there.\nEVE: But...?\nDOCTOR: But, it anticipated my every move. Outmanoeuvred me.\nTOBY: Meaning what?\nDOCTOR: Meaning that it hitched a lift back with me into the physical world. This world.\nRACHEL: So it’s in your head now?\nDOCTOR: No, no. It jumped ship as soon as I started to regain consciousness.\nSOAMES: So where is it?\nDOCTOR: Lying low. Acclimatising. Ideally I need to draw it into the open while it’s still disorientated.\nJEROME: But how come it needed you, Doctor? Why didn’t it just use our minds to get here?\nDOCTOR: Because to climb out of a hole you need rope, not thread.\nJEROME: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nSALLY: I think he means that our minds are puny compared to his.\nTOBY: Oh, charming.\nDOCTOR: No offence. In my case, it’s simply a question of advanced evolution.\nRACHEL: And that’s supposed to make us feel better?\nDOCTOR: It might do, given that it’s my fault the Kalarash is here.\nSALLY: How come?\nDOCTOR: At some point in the past it must have detected my presence, picked up my temporal trace. Since then it’s been devising a way to reach me.\nEVE: So what does it want, Doctor? Now it’s free?\nDOCTOR: Given the materials it has to hand, I’d say it’s seeking to manipulate and corrupt impressionable military minds in order to bring about Armageddon.\nTOBY: Are you serious?\nDOCTOR: No, Mr Dodds, I’m joking. I always joke about the end of the world.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR: (FX: FLICKING LEVERS. THRUM OF POWER) There, that should do it.\nRACHEL: Should? Aren’t you sure?\nDOCTOR: It’s a bit of a lash-up. Square pegs in round holes. Best I can do, in the circumstances.\nSOAMES: You’ve cannibalised the entire Bluefire system. Millions of pounds worth of equipment treated like... like old car parts.\nDOCTOR: Rest assured, Dr Soames, if this doesn’t work it’s not something you’ll have to worry about. Let’s see how the others are getting on. (WALKING) Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nEVE: . Oh, Doctor! I presume these cables will accommodate the power linkage between the Bluefire system and your machine?\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) A series of controlled temporal surges, Miss Pritchard, yes. —\nSALLY: You sure that duct tape will hold? It looks a bit dodgy.\nDOCTOR: Of course it will hold. It was made in Birmingham.\nSOAMES: So what exactly will happen when you switch this thing on?\nDOCTOR: (FX: WALKING OVER TO SPOT) With any luck the Kalarash will manifest right about... (STOPPING) .. here.\nSALLY: Manifest? Become solid, you mean?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Everybody, gather round again.\nJEROME: (FX: AS HE AND OTHERS GATHER ROUND DOCTOR) Aye-aye, looks like it’s showtime.\nDOCTOR: Now. The entity is currently composed of a series of slivers in incremental time. I’ve constructed a kind of time magnet, designed to draw it out into the open.\nSOAMES: (INCREDULOUSLY) Incremental time?\nDOCTOR: Cracks so minute they don’t officially exist.\nSALLY: You mean the entity has... divided itself up? Dispersed itself?\nDOCTOR: Like a vast number of microscopic iron filings stuck between the time-cracks. When I switch on, temporal energy from the\nTARDIS: will drag all those filings down to this one fixed point\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nTOBY: . and, hey presto!, our friend will appear?\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nSALLY: Will it be like that thing I saw in the attic room, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Possibly.\nJEROME: What thing?\nSALLY: Tall and thin. Like a reflection in a fun house mirror. Dark- skinned, sort of leathery. Its face was... vicious. Animal-like. And it was surrounded by blue fire. Bathed in it.\nJEROME: Nice.\nEVE: What’1ll happen when it appears, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: If all goes to plan, it will be contained in a temporal stasis field. Then I’1l set the TARDIS co-ordinates and... schlupp!\nTOBY: ‘Schlupp’? Is that a technical term?\nDOCTOR: It means that our friend will be sucked into the Vortex and expelled back into the wastelands.\nSOAMES: And what if it doesn’t go according to plan?\nDOCTOR: Then I suggest we run. Very fast. Now — is everyone standing well back, behind the power nexus?\nJEROME: Check.\nDOCTOR: Then — here we go!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: HE SLAMS A LEVER; WARBLING ELECTRONIC SCREECH AS THE\nSYSTEM: POWERS UP. IN THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE EVERYONE IS RAISING THEIR VOICE ABOVE THE ESCALATING DIN)\nDOCTOR: How are those readings, Miss Pritchard?\nEVE: Stable, Doctor.\nTOBY: Er... Doctor, there’s smoke coming from this connection here.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. That’s perfectly normal.\nSOAMES: (COUGHING) You realise that the sprinkler system will activate if it gets any worse?\nDOCTOR: No it won’t. I’ve disabled it.\nSOAMES: You’ve done what?\nSALLY: Look! Something’s happening!\nSALLY: (FX: FADE IN SOUNDS OF THE MI’EN KALARASH. IT IS IN TORMENT, SNARLING AND WRITHING)\nRACHEL: Oh my — [God!]\nTOBY: Is that thing real?\nJEROME: It’s just like you said, Sally. The blue fire and everything.\nSALLY: Doctor, the system’s overloading!\nDOCTOR: Just a few more seconds. It’s almost through! (SUDDEN ALARM) Miss Pritchard! Eve! No, don’t touch that connection!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE ELECTRONIC SCREECH SUDDENLY SUBSIDES, DIES. HEAVY BREATHING OF THE MI’EN KALARASH; CRACKLE OF BLUE FIRE)\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nRACHEL: What happened?\nSALLY: (ANXIOUSLY) Doctor...?\nSOAMES: It’s Eve. She broke the connection.\nDOCTOR: (OUTRAGED) Miss Pritchard! What have you done? (NO ANSWER) Miss Pritchard!\nTOBY: She can’t hear you.\nRACHEL: She’s in some kind of trance.\nSOAMES: Eve! Speak to us!\nSOAMES: (FX: THE MI’EN KALARASH ROARS, A HIDEOUS, DEMONIC SOUND. ACCOMPANYING THE ROAR IS A SURGING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY. THEN IT VANISHES.

Did you send it back where it came from?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not...\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH (FX: RECOGNISABLE AS EVE, BUT GUTTURAL/DEMONIC) Ahh. Freedom. But such a puny frame. So... temporary.\nSOAMES: (SHOCKED) Miss Pritchard?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nJEROME: Oh, man! Look at her eyes!\nJEROME: RACHEL/ TOBY /SOAMES\nSALLY: They’re full of blue fire.\nJEROME: It’s that thing, isn’t it, Doctor? It’s inside her.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. And not for the first time, I suspect. (RAISES\nHIS: VOICE) Isn’t that right, Mi’en Kalarash?\nHIS: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH Yes, Doctor. The human female has been preparing for this moment for over two Earth decades.\nSOAMES: She’s been working with that thing?\nDOCTOR: No. She’s been manipulated. Like a pawn on a chess board. Probably without even realising it was happening.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH\nDOCTOR: When the human female was four years old it was struck by a car. It suffered injuries to its brain. It almost died. For a split-second, as it hovered between being and not being, it slipped between the cracks. Our minds touched.\nDOCTOR: And you wormed your way in, didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH\nDOCTOR: Eve Pritchard brought a splinter of my consciousness back with her, into the world. Just the tiniest splinter, but enough to mould her thoughts into treading a particular path.\nDOCTOR: A path that led you to me.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH The female is bait, Doctor. You are the... ‘big fish’.\nDOCTOR: You've even gained a grasp of Earth idioms, I see. Not that you'll win any prizes for originality.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nSALLY: (WHISPERS) Not sure insulting it is a good idea, Doctor.\nTOBY: (WHISPERS) When should we run? Should we run now?\nTOBY: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH\nTOBY: You can run, little human, but there is no escape. The age of man is over. I will wring every drop of misery and pain and terror out of your species before crushing this world and moving on to the next.\nDOCTOR: (YAWNS) Have you finished? When you’ve heard one despotic rant, you’ve heard them all.\nSOAMES: For goodness’ sake, don’t goad the thing, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’ll do what it’s come to do anyway. We might as well have a bit of fun before we go.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’EN KALARASH Your fun is over, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So soon?\nTOBY: (NERVOUSLY) What’s it doing?\nJEROME: Why’s it raising its hand like that?\nSALLY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Brace yourselves.

If you tilt your head slightly the outline is clearly visible.\nSALLY: Yes... Yes, I can see it!\nJEROME: So can I.

All of you, concentrate.\nTOBY: I still can’t...\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Yes you can! The Kalarash thinks you’re stupid. Easily manipulated. But it’s wrong. Human beings are clever and determined and resourceful. And if you really want to go home, you'll see the door. All of you. Smack bang in the middle of the wall.\nTOBY: (EXCITED) Yes! I can see it!

I convinced you there was a door so you could break the Kalarash’s conditioning long enough to make the mental leap back to this reality.\nSALLY: [GHOST] You knew that was possible?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Well, I hoped.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nTOBY: [GHOST] (URGENTLY) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] What is it?\nTOBY: [GHOST] Through the glass, in that fear chamber place. It’s Miss Pritchard.\nSOAMES: [GHOST] In the storage facility. Yes.\nTOBY: [GHOST]\nTOBY: (CALLING) Miss Pritchard. Miss P[ritchard]. (MAKES TO BANG ON\nGLASS: — BUT CAN’T TOUCH ANYTHING) — Oh! Can’t seem to touch the window.\nSALLY: [GHOST] Thought-people, remember?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] She can’t hear you anyway, Mr Dodds. She’s in thrall to the Kalarash.\nJEROME: [GHOST] Why’s she just standing there?\nDOCTOR: The entity inside her is still gathering strength. Once it realises we’ve broken the conditioning, it’ll be back. Full of vim and vigour.\nSOAMES: [GHOST] (OMINOUSLY) Yes. Something must be done.\nSALLY: [GHOST]\nSALLY: What I don’t understand is — why didn’t it kill you when you were unconscious, Doctor? I see that it’s kept us alive to feed on our trauma and fear, but you’re different. You’re a threat. You know what it is and where it comes from. And you’ve served your purpose already, by bringing it here. (PAUSE; UNCERTAINLY ) Er.. why are you looking at me like that? I’ve said something stupid, haven’t I?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] On the contrary. Sally Morgan, you are a genius!\nSALLY: [GHOST] (SURPRISED) I am?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] That was an excellent question!\nJEROME: [GHOST] So what’s the answer, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Isn’t it obvious?\nRACHEL: [GHOST] Not to us mere mortals.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] The Kalarash hasn’t killed me because it can’t!\nDOCTOR: JEROME[GHOST] Why’s that, then?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] (THINKING ALOUD) The Ancient Ones might exist in Chaos, but they’re still bound by their own particular rules. Evidently the Kalarash can only influence others to kill and destroy. It can’t do it directly. I wonder [if] —\nSALLY: [GHOST] Doctor! .. Dr Soames is down in the chamber with Miss Pritchard.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] What?\nTOBY: [GHOST] Yes, walked right through the wall. Didn’t much fancy it myself.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] The idiot! If he disturbs it while it’s feeding — (CALLING) Dr\nDOCTOR: Soames!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 123\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] (FX: THROUGH GLASS) Dr Soames, get out of there at once!\nSOAMES: [GHOST]\nSOAMES: I heard what you said, Doctor. Once this thing knows we’ve broken its conditioning, it’1ll be back. (TO EVE) Miss Pritchard. Eve. It’s me, Dr Soames. I want you to listen to me. Whatever it is that’s got inside you, I need you to fight it. Fight it, do you understand?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] (FX: THROUGH GLASS) Stay away from that thing! Whatever you do, don’t —\nDOCTOR: (FX: A SURGING ELECTRICAL CRACKLE AND ZAP! LIKE A LIGHTNING\nSTRIKE. CROSS BACK TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] . get too close...\nSALLY: [GHOST] Where did he go? A flash of blue fire, and he just... disappeared.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] The bluefire energy acted as a shield for the Kalarash. It vaporised him.\nJEROME: [GHOST] Well, the doc might never have won any popularity contests, but I wouldn’t have wished that on him.\nTOBY: [GHOST]\nTOBY: Yes, but — he’s not really dead, is he? I mean, wasn’t that only his.. what did you call it? His thought-person self? His real body’s still here, unconscious.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Not unconscious. The shock will have killed his physical self, too.\nSALLY: [GHOST] (OFF) I’m afraid it’s true. He’s not breathing. He’s gone.\nTOBY: [GHOST] So if our ‘thought bodies’ die here, our real bodies die too?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Yes.\nRACHEL: [GHOST] So how the hell are we supposed to join back up with our real bodies, Doctor?\nJEROME: [GHOST] Or are we stuck like this now?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Hopefully, once we break the link with the Kalarash, the two separate parts will snap back together.\nRACHEL: [GHOST] ‘Hopefully’?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR: [GHOST]\nDOCTOR: Nothing is certain, Private McMahon. That’s what makes life so interesting. Now, we need to move our bodies to a place of safety.\nTOBY: [GHOST] And how the devil are we supposed to do that, if we can’t touch anything?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] (FROM OUTSIDE) Eyes right. Quick march.\nSALLY: [GHOST]/RACHEL [GHOST]/TOBY [GHOST]/JEROME [GHOST] (FROM OUTSIDE, MOVING IN) Left-right, left-right, left-right, left-right, left-right... [ETC]\nSALLY: (FX: SIMULTANEOUSLY, THEIR BODIES MARCH INTO TARDIS — WITH\nFOOTSTEPS: )\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] . and halt! (FX: FOOTSTEPS HALT) Doctor, over by the console, if you would.\nTOBY: [GHOST] Damned peculiar, making one’s own body march like this.\nRACHEL: [GHOST] Is that really what I look like to everyone else?\nJEROME: [GHOST] Oh, man. Carrying a few extra pounds there, Jerome.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] As I explained — our thought-selves have the power to control our physical bodies. Given the right orders, that is. Doors, please, Doctor.\nTOBY: [GHOST] So, we’ve got our bodies safe. What now, Doc?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Now — I’m going back outside, to rouse the Kalarash.\nSALLY: [GHOST] What?!?\nJEROME: [GHOST] It’ll vaporise you, like it did old Soames!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ]\nDOCTOR: I’m a Time Lord. I have defences of my own. If my plan succeeds, your thought-selves will be reunited with your bodies. And when that happens —\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 127\nTOBY: [GHOST] . we can come to your rescue, I suppose?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] Absolutely not.\nSALLY: [GHOST] It’s alright, Doctor. I’m not scared.\nTOBY: [GHOST] I am!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] You stay put, Sally. Stay in the TARDIS, do you understand?\nSALLY: [GHOST] Why? What is this plan of yours?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST]\nDOCTOR: I said, stay in the TARDIS. Private Fisher — as soon as I’m gone, I want you to compel your body to pull this lever. That’1ll seal the TARDIS doors.\nJEROME: [GHOST] Yes, sir!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Yes. No need to salute me, Private.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] (AUTHORITATIVE) Mi’en Kalarash. (LOUDER) Mi’en Kalarash!\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH (WOOZY) Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Yes. Surprised to see me, back here and fighting fit? Bit of a delay with the old cognitive transfer?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH The human brain is such a primitive instrument.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] A bad workman always blames his tools.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH Come closer, Doctor. So I can hear you better.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] And be vaporised by your bluefire shield? I think not. (VOICE HARDENS) I have a proposition for you, Kalarash.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’EN KALARASH What could you possibly offer me?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ]\nDOCTOR: What have you got here, Kalarash? A single planet. You’1l suck it dry and then move on. But these little planets are so unsatisfying, don’t you find? So lacking in sustenance.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH Your universe will sustain me, Doctor. I’1ll grow fat on the fear that I generate.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Oh, I doubt that. You’ll just be a scavenger. Always hungry. Always looking to stave off the gnawing emptiness inside.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH What do you propose?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST]\nDOCTOR: Stored in my memory is the misery of a hundred thousand races, on a hundred thousand worlds. It can all be yours, if you agree to leave the Earth and return to the wastelands with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH You are prepared to sacrifice all that you are for this miserable planet?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Imagine it, Kalarash. Grief, pain and destruction on a massive scale, accessed through the memories of a Time Lord. Eternity awaits. What do you say?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH I say... no.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] (SURPRISED) What?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH I say no, Time Lord. I refuse your offer.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] But why? I’m offering you a banquet, not a.. a finger buffet!\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH And I shall devour it, Time Lord. All of it.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Oh no. That’s not how it works.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH\nDOCTOR: (FX: CRACKLING FIRE — GROWING MORE POWERFUL) You have no choice. You underestimate my power. I have adapted to this reality. I shall devour your memories and your universe too. There is nothing you can do to stop me.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] (CRIES OUT IN PAIN) No. I won’t.. let you in!\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH Such flimsy defences, Time Lord. Such a weak mind. I expected more from the great Doctor... (BREAKS OFF) What is that... noise?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] (EFFORT) What... noise?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH\nDOCTOR: In the Systems Room. Ahh, I see you — forcing your physical self to carry out your pathetic schemes. But there is nothing your zombie can do up there to harm me in here.\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ] Really? (SHOUTING) Doctor — disengage failsafe!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A FLURRY OF PULSES, LIKE A DIGITISED GATLING GUN, FILLING\nTHE FEAR CHAMBER THROUGH: )\nTHE FEAR CHAMBER THROUGH: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH (PAINED, STRUCK BY PULSES) What... is... happening?\nDOCTOR: [GHOST ]\nDOCTOR: (PAINED, STRUCK BY PULSES) You should know. It was your influence over Eve Pritchard that helped to advance the research into Remote Emotional Programming.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’EN KALARASH (PAINED, STRUCK BY PULSES) Fear bullets!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST]\nDOCTOR: I’d sooner call them — a taste of your own medicine.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’'EN KALARASH (PAINED, STRUCK BY PULSES) I shall crush you, Doctor! Crush you utterly!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] I’m not afraid. (STEELY) What are the Ancient Ones afraid of, Kalarash? What do you see in your nightmares?\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH (PAINED, STRUCK BY PULSES) Such... unspeakable things!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Leave here. Go back to the wastelands. Break the link.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI'EN KALARASH No.. no! Have mercy!\nDOCTOR: [GHOST] Oh, I have plenty of mercy. (COLD) But none, I’m afraid, for you.\nDOCTOR: EVE/MI’EN KALARASH\nDOCTOR: (FX: ..WHICH BLENDS INTO A RUSHING, ELECTRICAL SURGE — BUT INVERTED; AN IMPLOSION RATHER THAN AN EXPLOSION.

And now — (FX: DOOR CONTROL ACTIVATED) — we’re going to rescue him. (FW WALKING TO DOORS) Come on.\nRACHEL: Sally, no. The Doctor said to stay put.\nTOBY: She’s not wrong.\nSALLY: He’s not an officer, he can’t hand out orders to any of us!\nJEROME: She’s right, you know. Come on!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 132\nSALLY: (TO HALT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: I thought I told you to stay inside the TARDIS.\nSALLY: Yes, and I ignored you.\nDOCTOR: Good girl.\nRACHEL: What happened? Where’s the Kalarash?\nDOCTOR: On the run.\nTOBY: What, literally?\nDOCTOR: I used my physical self to release the energies Dr Soames had stored up in the bluefire system. His ‘fear bullets’.\nTOBY: And you escaped without a scratch?\nRACHEL: Idiot. His physical self was up here at the time.\nDOCTOR: My mental self is a little shot up, I must admit. But I was able to escape back into my physical self as soon as the Kalarash retreated.\nTOBY: Yes, but where to?\nJEROME: Back into the bluefire system, dummy.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The conduit between this Universe and the wastelands.\nSALLY: What about Miss Pritchard? Eve?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR: Collapsed when the Kalarash dispossessed her. She’s unconscious, but she’ll be all right.\nTOBY: So that thing’s gone for good?\nDOCTOR: No.\nSALLY: /RACHEL/ TOBY / JEROME No?!?\nDOCTOR: I have to hunt it down while it’s still vulnerable, force it all the way back and seal the system for good.\nSALLY: How?\nDOCTOR: Help connect me up, Sally.\nSALLY: Lie down, Doctor.\nJEROME: You're seriously going back inside the system? After everything?\nDOCTOR: Back... to Bluefire House. Pressure pad ‘A’ on my frontal lobe, please, Sally.\nSALLY: (FX: CONNECTING THE DOCTOR BACK UP TO BLUEFIRE MACHINES) I know. Hold still.\nTOBY: You’re mad, going back to that place.\nDOCTOR: The Kalarash is in turmoil. Its carefully constructed empire is crumbling. But Bluefire House should still be standing. A temporary haven in a sea of instability.\nRACHEL: Because you created it?\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nJEROME: Why do you say it should still be standing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The world that the Mi’en Kalarash constructed will be collapsing around it. It’s bound to have some effect.\nSALLY: But what if it collapses with you inside it?\nDOCTOR: I’1l burn that bridge when I come to it. Now then, Sally. You know what to do.\nSALLY: Pull this lever down, leave you to cook on Regulo 7 for a few minutes, then push the lever back up again.\nDOCTOR: Give me at least five minutes. Whatever happens.\nSALLY: Don’t worry, Doctor. I won’t let you down.\nDOCTOR: No. I don’t believe you [will]\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: KEENING WIND THROUGH OPEN DOORWAY.

There’s a weird double heartbeat.\nTOBY: Twitching a bit, isn’t he?\nSALLY: His adrenaline’s pretty high. He must be busy in there.\nRACHEL: How long has he had?\nSALLY: Just coming up to two [minutes. ]\nRACHEL: Maybe you should pull him out now.\nSALLY: No. I promised the Doctor that, whatever happened, I’d give him five minutes.

Whatever happens.\nDOCTOR WHO: HOUSE OF BLUE FIRE by Mark Morris (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR: My fear, Kalarash? Very well. I fear the Old Times. The times of night and chaos. Perhaps you remember them too...?\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH I... remember.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And perhaps you, too, dread conjuring up the memory of those terrible times as much as I? Remembering what was done to you? Or — worse, perhaps — what it was you did...?\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH These thing are past! Their memory is nothing to fear!\nDOCTOR: It’s not remembering the Old Times I’m afraid of. My fear is, Kalarash...\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH Tell me!!!\nDOCTOR: My fear is, that the Old Times might be coming back.\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH That... cannot be!\nDOCTOR: Can’t it?\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH You think I haven’t noticed, Doctor? How you’ve been creeping further and further back, towards the open lift?\nDOCTOR: Have I?\nDOCTOR: MI’EN KALARASH You still think you can escape me. Bluff me.
