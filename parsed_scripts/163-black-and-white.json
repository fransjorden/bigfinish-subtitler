I’1ll just... make sure you’re doing it right.\nARISTEDES: As far as I can tell, we four are the only life-signs on board. Apart from the bats.\nACE: He’s out there somewhere. I’m thinking, alternative dimensions? He’s flipping reality inside the TARDIS somehow?\nARISTEDES: Could be. Not something I’d want to mess around with.\nACE: So, he hasn’t shown you how to work the TARDIS properly, then...?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 10\nARISTEDES: Just some basics. A few hours’ training a week.\nACE: Training? I never got training...\nARISTEDES: That’s probably too strong a word for it...\nACE: You said something before. About a mission?\nARISTEDES: Each operation has a clear objective. A specific target.\nACE: Target?\nARISTEDES: The Animus. The Great Intelligence. The Mi’en Kalarash. Derleth. To name a few. The Elder Gods, he calls them. He’s got a list somewhere.\nACE: Yeah, I’ve met a few. The Toymaker. The Karnas’koi —\nARISTEDES: Then you’1l know what we’re dealing with, won’t you?\nACE: You mentioned weapons. The Doctor wouldn’t go around with a cache of guns.\nARISTEDES: But canisters of explosive are perfectly acceptable?\nACE: I just can’t believe he ferries you two round like his little private army.\nARISTEDES: Then you’d better start believing. Because that’s exactly what we are.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: INT. BLACK TARDIS — SALLY’S ROOM\nSALLY: (BANDAGING HEX’S HAND) Nearly done. I’1l just tie off the bandage... (FX: SNIPPING BANDAGE) There.\nHEX: Nice job. Couldn’t have done much better meself.\nSALLY: Of course. The Captain called you ‘Nurse Schofield’. I take it that’s not a nickname?\nHEX: Fully qualified, me.\nSALLY: The Doctor and the Nurse. Makes sense I suppose.\nHEX: Never thought of it like that. (BEAT) Look. It’s nice of you coming after me, but you don’t know what’s happened.\nSALLY: Then tell me.\nHEX: I don’t even know you. How come you’re here anyway? And what’s all this ‘Yes Ma’am, No Ma’am’ stuff?\nSALLY: We’re a unit. A team. You’ve got to maintain the chain of command. It keeps us alive.\nHEX: It’s all a bit.. regimented. Formal, like. That’s not how the Doctor works.\nSALLY: Well it’s how we work. (BEAT) You and Ace? Are you...?\nHEX: No. (LOUDER) No! Just mates.\nSALLY: I suppose it’d be hard doing this alongside someone you... What am I talking about? Mum and Dad managed it.\nHEX: How’d you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 12\nSALLY: Military family. My parents worked alongside each other in Specialised Forces.\nHEX: The family business, yeah? My nan was a midwife. She brought me up.\nSALLY: Snap! Almost. I lived with my Grandad from when I was nine. He’d been a Colonel in Iraq.\nHEX: I’ve been on the wrong end of quite a few guns, recently. I didn’t think you were really gonna shoot me.\nSALLY: I wouldn’t have needed to. I’ve got the combat moves.\nHEX: Yeah, well. I might not be a soldier, but I’ve got moves of me own, you know.\nSALLY: I bet. I guess Ace handles all the rough stuff?\nHEX: She’s not in charge, though she thinks she is. We’re not together, like. But we do care about each other. (BEAT) Come on, then. How did you meet the Doctor?\nSALLY: (BEAT) I helped him.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: INT. BLUEFIRE SYSTEMS OPERATION ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nSALLY: Everyone — into the TARDIS now. You too, Doctor — Ah.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I seem to be rather tangled up in all these wires...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 6: INT. BLACK TARDIS — SALLY’S ROOM\nSALLY: There was a creature that fed on fear. Mine, and my... colleagues’. The Doctor risked his life to save us.\nSALLY: SCENE 7: INT. BLUEFIRE SYSTEMS OPERATION ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: Cool under pressure, Private Morgan. I admire that.\nSALLY: Yes, save the compliments ‘til later, perhaps-?\nDOCTOR: Asks all the right questions, and even listens to the answers. Obeys the right orders, disregards the wrong ones. Yes, all very admirable qualities. And with one bound, he was free. Come along.\nSALLY: Course, if you’ve got any kind words, Doctor — save them for my C.O. I could use a promotion.\nDOCTOR: The thing is, Sally Morgan — I was rather hoping you might consider going AWOL instead.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. BLACK TARDIS — SALLY’S ROOM\nSALLY: So I did. Two weeks later we were tracking down zombie lizards\nSALLY: on a cemetery planet.\nHEX: You what?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. ALIEN CATACOMBS [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ECHOING STONE TUNNELS, DRIPPING. DOCTOR & SALLY RUNNING UP, DISTANT ECHOING LIZARD HISSES)\nDOCTOR: (STOPPING) I’ve been meaning to ask. Are you lonely, Sally?\nSALLY: (STOPPING) Doctor. We’re on the run from an army of dead lizards re-animated by their Ancient God. I don’t think now’s the time to discuss my social life.\nDOCTOR: You may be right. But it does put things in perspective.\nSALLY: I think you’re looking down the wrong end of the telescope.\nDOCTOR: There’s someone I want you to meet. I think it’s time.\nSALLY: We’re stuck underground with no way back to the TARDIS. Everyone else is gone.\nDOCTOR: I haven’t always taken good enough care of my friends. I’m trying to change. After all these centuries... it’s not easy.\nSALLY: Four shots left in my rifle. (FX: RIFLE COCKED) And you’ve got- an umbrella.\nDOCTOR: Soldiers have a different outlook. A military life is one of sacrifice. You know that better than most, Sally Morgan.\nSALLY: Doctor — I don’t know if this is really-\nDOCTOR: Practical as ever, Private. Yes. First things first.\nSALLY: We're getting out of here?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Hand me that bio-tracker. I’m about to do something rather clever to its innards...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. BLACK TARDIS — SALLY’S ROOM\nSALLY: After that, we found the Captain. We’ve been tracking these ‘Gods’ ever since.\nHEX: You’ve really put your faith in him, haven’t you?\nSALLY: All I’ve ever seen him do is good. He saves people.\nHEX: I was like you at first. Trusting. Happy to follow him blindly round the universe. But you’ve gotta be careful.\nSALLY: What do you mean?\nHEX: Some time, some day, he’1ll let you down. He won’t mean to do it. He might even say it’s for your own good. He might even believe it himself. But he’1ll do it. Just... be prepared.\nSALLY: I can’t believe he’d ever hurt me. Or the Captain. Or you and Ace for that matter.\nHEX: The thing you’ve gotta remember is — he’s not human. He doesn’t understand. He might know all about space and time and that. But when it comes to how we feel, there’s a great big blank.\nSALLY: He’s let you down.\nHEX: It was to do with me mam. He knew things. Things he should have told me. I thought I understood. I thought I’d forgiven him. And I suppose a part of me thought he might have changed.\nSALLY: Look — it’s the same for us. All this time together... suddenly we find out we’re not his priority.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nACE: You know what doesn’t make sense?\nARISTEDES: Everything?\nACE: He’s targeting these Elder Gods when he’s with you two. But with me and Hex, they just... turn up.\nARISTEDES: So it seems.\nACE: So where were you going? (BEAT) The book! I did Beowulf at school — only paid attention ‘cos of the fighting.\nARISTEDES: (PICKING UP BOOK) Well, it’s a twenty-second century edition of a nineteenth century translation of an eleventh century Anglo- Saxon manuscript. Based on a story that originates in the fifth or sixth century. Take your pick.\nACE: You could steer the TARDIS? To any of those times?\nARISTEDES: Never got as far as flying solo.\nACE: What happened with you, Lysandra? I tried to find you once. They said you were on Black Ops.\nARISTEDES: Standard cover story for missing C-4 personnel. In my case, they didn’t know how right they were.\nACE: You weren’t the Doctor’s biggest fan.\nARISTEDES: I changed my mind. Sue me. I’d been made Acting Director — basically a flak-magnet for all the Department’s bad publicity.\nACE: After Nimrod.\nARISTEDES: Three months later, the Doctor came back. And he absolutely knew what was coming.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: EXT. LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Welcome to London, Private Morgan.\nSALLY: (WALKING) I’m... home? But what’s with all the police? The army?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) A little after your time, I think. There’s been an... event.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 13: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: The evacuees had started shipping in. London was in danger of\nARISTEDES: falling into chaos.\nARISTEDES: SCENE 14: EXT. LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nSALLY: What’s happening, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: There are times when history hangs in the balance. Tipping points. This is one.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: And in the confusion, someone burrowed into what was left of\nARISTEDES: the Archive.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: They call themselves the Sons of Kai. The authorities think they’re just anarchist troublemakers.\nSALLY: But they’re more than that?\nSALLY: SCENE 17: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: We had no idea. Controlling them was a creature called the Kai’lizakia. And guess what?\nARISTEDES: SCENE 18: EXT. LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nSALLY: Another Evil from the Dawn of Time?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. Who better qualified to deal with it than us?\nSALLY: No-one!\nDOCTOR: Actually, I’ve a friend — an acquaintance — who might lend a hand. I’d like you to join her unit incognito — for now.\nSALLY: She’s an officer?\nDOCTOR: A Captain. I’m rather hoping you’1l get along...\nDOCTOR: SCENE 19: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: So he fought it. We fought it.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS — LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nARISTEDES: (SHOUTING) Back! Get back! (TO DOCTOR) Doctor, it’s no good.\nDOCTOR: Get your people out, Lysandra. It’s my turn now.\nARISTEDES: What can you hope to achieve with that — that contraption?\nDOCTOR: A Cyber-planner’s cerebral cortex, in fact. This creature feeds on chaos... so let’s give it a taste of pure logic.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUZZ OF CYBER-PLANNER FEEDBACK — AS IN ‘GIRL WHO NEVER WAS’, PART FOUR, SCENE 68 — AND KAI’LIZAKIA SCREAMS. )\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: Not long after, he asked me the question...\nFADE TO: SCENE 22: EXT. LONDON 2026 [FLASHBACK]\nARISTEDES: (SHOUTING) They’re going to hang me out to dry this time.\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING, WALKING AWAY FROM NOISE) Not your fault, Lysandra. The Kai’lizakia was too powerful. Once it saw its chance, there was no stopping it. Well, almost no stopping it.\nARISTEDES: (WALKING) But the Sons of Kai, they were just... chancers. It shouldn’t have gone that far.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR: Chancers with one of the Ancient Powers of the Universe behind them. The Kai’lizakia was always one of the minor Gods, but still dangerous enough once given its head. (CORRECTING HIMSELF) Heads. Ah, here comes Private Morgan.\nSALLY: (RUNNING UP) Everyone accounted for, Captain. The tech from the Crichton Building’s secured. Getting boxed up now for transfer.\nDOCTOR: You’ve made sure those... particular items, have gone into that... particular box?\nSALLY: Yes, Doctor. Into the TA- (STOPS) Oops.\nARISTEDES: I wondered where you’d been seconded from, Morgan.\nDOCTOR: I think, perhaps, we should continue this conversation somewhere a little... quieter.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP B/G HUM. DOORS OPENING. DOCTOR WALKS IN, FOLLOWED BY ARISTIDES & SALLY)\nARISTEDES: Why’s it black on the outside now? It was white before.\nDOCTOR: Black and white and blue all over. Sally, would you get the doors, please?\nSALLY: It can be a bit disorientating the first time, Captain...\nARISTEDES: Don’t worry, Private. I’ve been in this thing before.\nDOCTOR: (CONSIDERING) Yes. You have. Haven’t you.\nARISTEDES: And from what I remember, you gave me pretty short shrift.\nDOCTOR: You had to stay here, Captain. So that I could come back. So that we could do this.\nARISTEDES: And the others? What happened to them?\nSALLY: Who’s she talking about?\nARISTEDES: The Doctor had friends with him last time we met. Miss [McShane ]-\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING HER OFF) Somewhere safe, not that it’s any of your concern. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Private Morgan travels with me now.\nARISTEDES: So you’re a real cadet?\nSALLY: King’s New Delta Squadron.\nARISTEDES: But now you take orders from the Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 24\nSALLY: I’ve had worse C.O.s.\nDOCTOR: You know there’s nothing I’d ask you to do that I wouldn’t be willing to do myself, Lysandra.\nARISTEDES: So why don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Even I can’t be in two places at once. Well, not without a great deal of forward planning.\nSALLY: We could do with another pair of hands. You said yourself, Captain, it’s not gonna be much fun for you out there.\nDOCTOR: So. What’s it to be, Captain? Stay here as ‘Acting Director’? Or come with us and take direct action?\nARISTEDES: Are you trying to recruit me?\nDOCTOR: Think of it as volunteering.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nACE: (STUNNED) I don’t believe it. Right from the off, he’s been using you to track down these Gods and take them out. Two- timing us!\nARISTEDES: Ace, I never wanted to replace you in the Doctor's... affections.\nACE: Just shut up, Lysandra. I’m trying to work it out.\nARISTEDES: (LOSING PATIENCE) I’ve had enough of this. Boo-hoo. The Doctor didn’t trust you enough to tell you his great plan. Get over rts\nACE: But you haven’t replaced us, have you? We’re still here.\nARISTEDES: I had noticed.\nACE: No. He’s running you like crack commandos. Black clears the way for White. Or is it something else?\nARISTEDES: The only way we’ll know for sure is by finding him. I don’t like it any more than you, McShane — but he’s forced us into this, so...\nACE: . We might as well work together? That what you’re saying?\nARISTEDES: (TENDERING HAND) Shake on it?\nACE: Get real, Lysandra. Best I’ll give you is a temporary ceasefire.\nARISTEDES: Good enough.\nACE: Alright. Let’s take another look at that book, shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: INT. BLACK TARDIS — SALLY’S ROOM\nHEX: . So that’s what happened with me Mam. (REACHING INTO POCKET,\nTAKING: OUT WALLET) I’ve got a picture of her, in me wallet. (SHOWS HER) See?\nSALLY: She’s beautiful.\nHEX: That’s how I remember her. Not all the stuff that came after.\nSALLY: It’s good you’ve got something. (BEAT) Pina coladas.\nHEX: You what?\nSALLY: I never knew my mum either. Not properly. But pina coladas —she and dad always made them when they came back on leave. I remember the smell. Coconut. Reminds me of her.\nHEX: Sally, is she — [dead?]\nSALLY: Yeah. Dad too. At least they were together. That’s what they told me.\nHEX: What happened?\nSALLY: Failed state. Middle of nowhere. Their convoy was ambushed. Dad didn’t survive the first blast. Mum got some of her people clear, but then... (TRAILS OFF)\nHEX: Sorry, like.\nSALLY: Long time ago. Long time since I told anyone.\nHEX: Not even Lysandra?\nSALLY: She doesn’t need to know. Nor the Doctor. Although sometimes, I think he does...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 27\nHEX: What happened next?\nSALLY: Shipped off home. To Grandad’s. He was so proud when I got my Sign-up papers. Despite everything.\nHEX: The Doctor reminds you of him, does he?\nSALLY: (AMUSED) Oh, no! But now I think about it, he does remind me of Henry.\nHEX: Who’s that? Your uncle?\nSALLY: (LAUGHING) No, Henry was Grandad’s cat. Ancient, but sweet. Grey-green eyes. He’d disappear for days on end, and do absolutely anything for a kipper.\nHEX: Yeah, that sounds like the Doctor. What sort was he?\nSALLY: You know, I’ve no idea. Bit of a moggy really. Black and white.\nHEX: Sounds like something’s working.\nSALLY: You never know, the Doctor might’ve turned up. With an explanation.\nHEX: That’ll have to be one heck of an explanation. OK. I’1ll give him five minutes. I just hope- (PAUSE)\nSALLY: Hope what?\nHEX: Nothing’s happened to him, like.\nSALLY: (GETTING UP) Come on. Let’s find out.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 28\nHEX: (RUNNING) You know what?\nSALLY: (RUNNING) What?\nHEX: (RUNNING) Your granddad, my nan. We should hook them up.\nSALLY: (RUNNING) Sucker for a happy ending, aren’t you?\nHEX: (RUNNING — GOING OFF) Next stop. We find a pub. I’11 buy you the biggest pina colada you’ve ever seen.\nSALLY: (RUNNING — OFF) It’s a date...!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nACE: I thought you knew how to use these controls, Lysandra?\nARISTEDES: I didn’t do anything!\nACE: (PUSHING HER OUT OF THE WAY) Let me try.\nHEX: (ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY SALLY) So, where’ve you brought us,\nHEX: ladies?\nACE: Calmed down a bit, have we?\nHEX: Yeah. Sorry. Lost it back there,\nHEX: time out.\nACE: after everything. Needed some\nACE: Blonde hair, blue eyes perking you up? Who’d have thought?\nHEX: (SOTTO) They’re green, actually.\nSALLY: Captain? Where are we?\nARISTEDES: Exactly where we were.\nSALLY: But the engine sound-\nARISTEDES: -wasn’t us. Look at the scanner.\nHEX: But that’s-\nACE: The inside of the TARDIS. Yeah.\nHEX: Another TARDIS? He’s got another\nHEX: TARDIS?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 30\nARISTEDES: And it’s materialised around this one.\nSALLY: That’s just insane. Two TARDISes? ‘TARDI’? Is that a word?\nACE: Look, Hex. The hatstand.\nHEX: That’s your jacket, Ace.\nACE: Which means we’re inside our own TARDIS. The White one.\nARISTEDES: Occam’s razor. We’re here wondering about alternate dimensions and different realities. When the simplest explanation is, we've been flying around in two different TARDISes.\nACE: And now the doors work. Hex, shall we?\nHEX: My pleasure. (EXITING)\nARISTEDES: Go ahead. I’1l run a scan. (TO SALLY) Private, a word.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT. WHITE TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nHEX: (EMERGING & CALLING) Hello? Doctor?\nACE: (FOLLOWING) Lysandra’s scanning for lifesigns. He’s shown her how to scan for lifesigns. He’s never shown me how to scan for lifesigns.\nHEX: There’s me boots. Definitely our TARDIS.\nACE: Just as we left it. (FX: TRYING DOOR CONTROLS) Doors aren’t working.\nHEX: We’re still in the vortex, remember.\nACE: So we're just as stuck as we were. (BANGS CONSOLE IN FRUSTRATION) Where are you, Professor?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: (FX: USING TARDIS CONTROLS) Been getting on well with our Mr Schofield, haven’t you, Private?\nSALLY: He’s a nice lad, Captain.\nARISTEDES: Don’t get too attached. (CHECKING TARDIS READINGS) Right — nothing. Nobody else in either ship. Only his friends.\nSALLY: We’re all his friends, aren’t we?\nARISTEDES: Correction. We’re professionals.\nACE: Definitely our ship.\nHEX: But no-one’s home.\nSALLY: So we're still at square one?\nARISTEDES: Right. Tell me again how you summoned the TARDIS? I’m guessing yours had a delayed response and locked onto this one.\nHEX: The Doctor, he’d set a trap for these two scumbag aliens. It just appeared when we passed his test.\nACE: I guess it must have been set to automatic. You know, like the Fast Return Switch.\nARISTEDES: Sorry? The what?\nACE: You know. Fast Return Switch. Takes you back to the last place the TARDIS-— (REALISATION) Oh.\nSALLY: You mean all this time, we could have just gone back to where we left the Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 33\nARISTEDES: (TAKING COMMAND) Private. With me. You two — into your TARDIS.\nACE: No way. You’ve forgotten, I’m not signed up with anyone. You can’t give me orders.\nARISTEDES: Then what do you suggest? The last thing we want to do is lose one of these TARDISes.\nHEX: TARDI.\nACE: What I suggest is, I come with you, Lysandra. These two stay safe in the White.\nARISTEDES: Morgan?\nSALLY: Fine by me.\nARISTEDES: Let’s get you kitted up, then.\nHEX: (SOTTO) Ace, do you know what you’re doing?\nACE: (SOTTO) Don’t I always? (BEAT) No, I want to keep Lysandra where I can see her. As for you, I’d say keep an eye on Sergeant Barbie, but I see you already are.\nHEX: (SOTTO) Hey, what do you mean?\nACE: (SOTTO) Just... don’t get distracted.\nHEX: (SOTTO) As if anything like that would even have crossed my mind at a time like this.\nACE: (SOTTO) You’re a man, mortal peril wouldn’t stop you from thinking about that for a moment. Just — be careful.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 34\nARISTIDES: Enough of the whispering, you two.\nACE: Finished packing the kitchen sink, then?\nSALLY: Just the minimum of field essentials. Lockbreakers, plasma grenades, spatio-temporal tracking devices...\nACE: (SARKY) Ooh, ‘Spatio-temporal tracking devices’.\nARISTIDES: Don’t often see you without a rucksack, McShane.\nACE: Three cans of nitro and a spare pair of tights, that’s all. You’11 get a hunchback lugging all that around.\nSALLY: (MUTTERED) Someone’s got the hump, that’s for sure.\nACE: I heard that!\nHEX: (INTERVENING) All set, then, Sal?\nSALLY: Your place it is, Hex.\nARISTEDES: Good luck, Private. Nurse Schofield.\nHEX: (EXITING, TO ARISTIDES AND ACE) You two — try not to bite too many lumps out of each other while we’re gone, eh?\nACE: Go on then, Captain. Press the switch.\nARISTEDES: Why don’t you do it, you’re so keen to take charge?\nACE: (RACING UP TO CONTROL) Ha! He hasn’t shown you where it is, has he?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 35\nARISTEDES: Just do it, McShane.\nACE: It’s like he’s playing hide and seek. All the way through space\nACE: and time.\nARISTEDES: Some kind of game, yeah.\nACE: (PRESSING SWITCH) OK, Professor. Coming. Ready or not.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT. WHITE TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nHEX: So, what now?\nSALLY: Just wait, I guess. I take it you’ve no idea what any of these controls do?\nHEX: I can open the doors, that’s about it.\nSALLY: OK. What did you press?\nHEX: Me? Nothing!\nHEX: (FX: SEVERAL DIFFERENT ALARMS — BECOMING INCREASINGLY URGENT/NOISY THROUGH FOLLOWING. )\nSALLY: You must have done something!\nHEX: Look — I’m not touching it.\nSALLY: Another one! And another.\nHEX: What’s that?\nHEX: (FX: A FLURRY OF BATS SQUEAKING, SWOOPING DOWN, SWARMING\nTHROUGH: INTERNAL DOOR TO CLOISTERS )\nSALLY: The bats are leaving the belfry!\nHEX: What do they know that we don’t?\nHEX: (FX: ALARMS REACH CRESCENDO THEN SUDDENLY STOP.

We shall feast at the place of Beowulf’s victory!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. HART’S HALL\nACE: Right, Ace — ‘Procedure!’ (LOOKING AROUND) Fire — glowing. Food on the tables — steaming. Which means either that whoever was here left in a hurry, or...\nWEOHSTAN: (OFF, CALLING) Here comes the hero!\nNORSEMEN: (OFF, CHANTING) Beowulf! Beowulf!\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (OFF, CALLING) The fight makes me hungry! Let us feast!\nACE: Great. Vikings! Now, what would Lysandra do? Ace’s procedure: hide under the table!\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Feast!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. WHITE TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nHEX: What now? We can’t just sit here.\nSALLY: I’m wondering... If we followed the other TARDIS, then we’re back where the Doctor left us.\nHEX: Any idea where that was? Did he tell you anything, say anything at all that could be a clue?\nSALLY: You know the Doctor. Half the things he says are clues to\nSALLY: something...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: (QUOTING) ‘O wise of men, mourn not; for to each man ‘tis better/ That his friend he awreak than to weep overmuch.’\nARISTEDES: (BEAT) And that’s helpful because...?\nDOCTOR: Poor old William. No-one much cared for his translation at the time. Personally, I think it has a certain... brio.\nSALLY: Translation of what?\nDOCTOR: (BUSY AT CONTROL) Now, the Mythos can be broken down into three stages. Thesis. Antithesis. Synthesis.\nARISTEDES: Right. It’s one of those conversations, is it?\nDOCTOR: (FX: FIDDLING WITH CONTROLS) Every story has a beginning. A middle. And an end. But not necessarily in that order. It’s a question of finding the correct point of entry... There!\nSALLY: So where are we going Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Somewhere cold. (THOUGHTFUL) With an icy reception in prospect.\nARISTEDES: Once, just once, it’d be nice to turn up somewhere where people are actually pleased to see us.\nDOCTOR: You usually manage to win them round, Lysandra.\nARISTEDES: I’1ll break out the weapons. (EXITS TO CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) It must be your sunny disposition!\nSALLY: She’s right, though, Doctor. It’d be much simpler if we could actually tell people we’re there to help as soon as we arrive.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR: It’s an unwritten rule of the universe, Sally Morgan, that no sooner one resolves to keep things simple, they become very complicated, very quickly.\nSALLY: Yes, I have noticed...\nDOCTOR: Besides, people often don’t realise they need help. Or won’t admit it.\nSALLY: So where are we going this time?\nDOCTOR: I told you. Into a story.\nSALLY: OK. That’s all I’m getting?\nDOCTOR: For now. A-ha! We’ve arrived.\nSALLY: I’1ll get my pack. (EXITS TO CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER SALLY) I meant what I said. It’1ll be chilly out there. You’d best wrap up.\nDOCTOR: (EXITING TARDIS) Now, then. Where are you hiding? (FADING INTO DISTANCE) Right at the beginning? Buried in the middle, perhaps? Or are we at the end?\nDOCTOR: [NB: SPEECH REPEATED IN SCENE 60]\nARISTIDES: Doctor?\nSALLY: Don’t go without us! (RUSHING TO DOORS) Hold up, we’re just [coming] — (FX: DOORS CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY IN HER FACE) — oh!\nSALLY: (TO ARISTIDES) Captain? Why’d you close the doors?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL)\nARISTIDES: I didn’t. I didn’t do anything.\nSALLY: What? Well, just open them, anyway —\nSALLY: (RUSHING TO CONSOLE) No! No!

Now we’re stuck in the middle of — well, whatever we’re stuck in the middle of, with no orders, no back-up, no way of radioing HQ. Black TARDIS down.\nHEX: Guess we could just follow his lead. You know — see what’s outside those doors?\nSALLY: Assuming they work.\nHEX: (PULLING DOOR CONTROL) Here goes!\nHEX: SCENE 42: EXT.

(CALLING BACK) Come and see, Sal. It’s like a ruined castle. Half the wall’s been taken out. Recently, too, from the look of it. (TURNING BACK) Sal? (BREAKS OFF AS HE SEES TARDIS) Whoah, now that’s weird.\nSALLY: (AT TARDIS THRESHOLD) Why are you looking at me like that? Have I got something on my face?\nHEX: Not you — the TARDIS! From here, you’1ll see. (FX: SALLY\nSTEPPING: OVER) It’s gone all — I dunno, transparent?\nSALLY: That is weird. —\nHEX: The doors!\nSALLY: (REACHING OUT) My hand... It’s gone right through.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 54\nHEX: Like it’s a ghost.\nSALLY: Hex, if we can’t get back into the TARDIS-\nHEX: Yeah. We’re stuck.\nHEX: (FX: LOUDER WHOOSH OF XYBROX JETS & EXPLOSION AS OUTSIDE FOREST\nSET: ALIGHT — DISTANT CRIES FROM WIGLAF )\nSALLY: What was that?\nHEX: Come on, nothing we can do here.

Who are these persons?\nWIGLAF: This Valkyrie and her herald were sent by Odin to save you.\nOLD BEOWULF: Then my thanks go to Odin. We should move. Before the dragon returns.

BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: (TO TARDIS) We’ll meet monsters. Oh yes, we’ll meet monsters, you and I. But you can’t always tell the difference between the monsters and the people.\nDOCTOR: No, sometimes the monsters and the people can’t tell the difference, either.\nDOCTOR: Which reminds me. Time for a test.\nDOCTOR: Let’s try a precision landing. On a moving vessel.\nDOCTOR: The Ventalis system, I think. The good ship Lorelei...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: EXT.

Safe in that White [TARDIS] —\nARISTEDES: Now, that’s something bigger than scrap.\nARISTEDES: Considerably bigger.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. HART’S HALL\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (ALOUD) Meat! Bring more meat! (TO WEOHSTAN) So, Weohstan, what is my reward?\nWEOHSTAN: Horses, my lord. King Hrothgar has promised horses.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Divide them among the men. What of the gold?\nWEOHSTAN: I have yet to settle an amount.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (MUNCHING) I do not like the way Lord Unferth looks at me. He should be taught some manners.\nWEOHSTAN: It would be wise not to pursue this grudge. He has some standing with the King.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: A sorry sort of kingdom, this. The land is wet and marshy. I do not like it.\nWEOHSTAN: No matter, sire. We need not tarry here. King Hygelac will hear of his nephew’s deeds soon enough. Your name will be on every tongue when the tale is carried back.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (STRETCHING) I still feel the toll in my muscles. The creature struggled, did it not?\nWEOHSTAN: To no avail, my Lord.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: It was a lot... smaller than I expected.\nWEOHSTAN: Yes. We need not mention that.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: The tale-telling I leave to you. I prefer actions to words.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 60\nWEOHSTAN: (RISING) Give me leave, my Lord, I’ve actions of my own to complete.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: What’s that?\nWEOHSTAN: King Hrothgar still parades the trophy. I need to discuss the matter of the gold.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Go. Politicking is your domain.\nWEOHSTAN: (LEAVING) I shall return soon, my Lord.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Do — or we'll have finished this feast! (WAVING HIM OFF &\nDROPPING: MEAT) Ah, I dropped my mutton. (ALOUD) ‘Tis good your monster did not slip my grip so easily!\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (LOOKING UNDER TABLE) Now where did it fall? (SEES ACE) Hold. What have we beneath our table?\nACE: (HIDING UNDER TABLE — BANGS HEAD) Ow. Er, hello. Would you care to see the dessert menu?\nYOUNG BEOWULF: A young lad, keen to see how warriors celebrate a kill!\nACE: Not a lad. Clearly, not a lad.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: A wench, eh? You cannot keep away from the menfolk after battle? Come out from there. (FX: DRAGGING ACE OUT) What pleases you? Something to eat? Roast fowl, ox or fish? Or is it something else you desire?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 61\nACE: Don’t flatter yourself, beardy. Oh, and never, ever, call me ‘wench’. Here, have a drumstick. Second thoughts, have the whole chicken. (FX: ACE HITS BEOWULF WITH ROAST CHICKEN AND\nRUNS: )\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Right, my girl. We have a chase!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: EXT.

(WONDERING) A robot of some kind. A malfunctioning robot. (TO WARBOT) What’s wrong with you? Where are you from?\nARISTEDES: (FX: GLOOP AS GARUNDEL SURFACES FROM SWAMP & PUTS GUN TO ARISTEDES’ HEAD)\nARISTEDES: And why’s there a blaster pressed against my head?\nGARUNDEL: Hold that thought, sister. (FX: SPOUTS OUT WATER) Word of advice. Next time you sneak up on a person, turn off your hi- tech tracking devices. They’re making my detectors squeal like a broodlayer on spawning day. Oh, and wear less squeaky boots.\nARISTEDES: Who are you? What are you doing hiding in a swamp?\nGARUNDEL: So many questions from someone on the wrong end of a gun? You first, sister.\nARISTEDES: I’m a traveller. Looking for my friend.\nGARUNDEL: Nicely non-specific. So you haven’t come looking for that?\nARISTEDES: I’ve no idea what that is.\nGARUNDEL: That’s Grade A technology right there. Xybrox Warbot remote drone for hand-to-hand combat. Lots of lasers and killsticks. Dialled down to weapontech one point five for... local conditions.\nARISTEDES: (DUBIOUS) All right... but if it’s supposed to be superior technology, why’s it walking round in circles, hitting itself on the head?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 63\nGARUNDEL: OK, it’s not at the top of its game. (FX: FIDDLING WITH REMOTE CONTROL) And something’s fazizzled its remote receiver. The off-signal should be.. there!\nARISTEDES: You haven’t answered my questions.\nGARUNDEL: Military, I guess? I can tell you guys a light year away. The name’s Garundel. And right now I’m on a schedule. Move it.\nARISTEDES: (WALKING) Why are you here? What are you, some sort of toad- man?\nGARUNDEL: Hey. Nix on the personal remarks, sister. I am Urodelian. Not toad. As for ‘man’, ‘woman’: don’t be so mammal-centric. (DISDAINFUL) ‘Toad-man’ — huh.\nARISTEDES: Have you been here long? Seen any other... travellers?\nGARUNDEL: That’d be the little guy in the hat? (SUCKS TEETH) Nasty. I might know something about him, yeah. Again, I say- naaasty.\nARISTEDES: Tell me. Now.\nGARUNDEL: Remind me. Who’s got the gun? (FX: ALARM — LIKE DIGITAL WATCH) OK. ‘Scuse me, sister. Got a top level meeting with a local venture partner. I need you to stay right here.\nGARUNDEL: You’re not gonna let me tie you up are you? (BEAT) OK, that’s\nGARUNDEL: how you wanna play it? Didn’t want to waste the shot...\nARISTEDES: No! Wait!\nGARUNDEL: . but frankly, it’s a heck of a lot easier.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 64\nWEOHSTAN: (OFF — CALLING) Toad-man!\nGARUNDEL: What is it with the people on this planet and the personal comments? I don’t go on about the facial hair and hygiene issues. (CALLING) Weohstan. Fella! Over here.\nWEOHSTAN: (ARRIVING) What is this, toad-man? A body? Your... next meal?\nGARUNDEL: For the last time, buddy. Not a toad. I do have a name.\nWEOHSTAN: Garren... del? It is a fitting monster’s name.\nGARUNDEL: I give up. So, the plan. Small hitch in the, ah, execution, but you’re getting the goods, right?\nWEOHSTAN: The King is pleased. Soon, we will have the gold.\nGARUNDEL: And my reactors will be operational again. All very well Signalling the Mothers-ship, but if I can’t take off...\nWEOHSTAN: The beast has a mother?\nGARUNDEL: Don’t we all fella? I got four. Be back here at sunrise. Or I’1ll come eat you for breakfast. There’s a good native.\nWEOHSTAN: Yes, toad-man. (BEAT) Gar-endel. (DEPARTING) Your place in the story is assured.\nGARUNDEL: Whatever gets me the gold, little apeman. (TO SELF) Can’t say it’s been a pleasure. I for one cannot wait to get off this miserable planet.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: No, no, no. You need to learn to follow co-ordinates. Until you can do that, I shan’t be taking you back to Earth.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Where the humans come from.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. (BEAT) You liked Miss Chenka, didn’t you?\nDOCTOR: Another time, perhaps... But not now...\nDOCTOR: Soon. We’1ll visit Earth soon. But before we do, you need to learn to listen properly when I set a destination. Now. Let’s\nDOCTOR: try again.

You are welcome in what remains of my home.\nSALLY: (ENTERING) Thank you, Your, er, Majesty.\nWIGLAF: It still offers shelter from the night winds.\nSALLY: This is your home? But it’s just... ruins.\nOLD BEOWULF: ‘Tis a ruin now, Valkyrie. You should have seen it filled with Geat warriors and their women. There was a mead-hall.\nHEX: That’s a point. Where is everyone?\nWIGLAF: Address your king with respect, knave!\nHEX: How come she’s all ‘great Valkyrie’ and I get the knave treatment?\nWIGLAF: You bleed, boy. Your hand is bound and I see the stain. You are mortal. The Shieldmaiden bears the weapons of Thor himself.\nOLD BEOWULF: I would see what else this Valkyrie carries on her back. Some wings perhaps? To meet the dragon in the skies.\nSALLY: Tell us about this dragon.\nOLD BEOWULF: Wiglaf — your father was the tale-teller.\nWIGLAF: I have not inherited his way with words... (SUSPICIOUS) But I am surprised they do not know already.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 67\nSALLY: The.. news hasn’t reached Valhalla yet.\nWIGLAF: The dragon ravages these lands without mercy. It flies in from its lair on the cliffs. It cuts the air, raining fire from its mouth. Its roar is a terrible thing. Few who hear it survive.\nOLD BEOWULF: First we knew was when it fired my Hall five days ago. Since then, my thanes have all deserted. All but Wiglaf.\nWIGLAF: At least the monster seared the skin from their backs as they fled.\nHEX: That’s a bit harsh. No-one deserves that.\nWIGLAF: This is my world. If you do not like it (FX: UNSHEATHS SWORD) here is the way to the next.\nSALLY: There’s no need for-\nOLD BEOWULF: Wiglaf! Let them speak.\nSALLY: Thank you, your majesty. I’m sorry to hear of your troubles. We came here looking for our friend. The Doctor. Dragons are probably right up his alley.\nOLD BEOWULF: I have met one like you before, Shieldmaiden. Many years ago. One of the Aesir. She also sought a ‘Doctor’.\nWIGLAF: My father spoke of this. Across the seas, in the Hall of Hrothgar of the Danes.\nOLD BEOWULF: Indeed. I had just wrestled the demon Grendel.\nHEX: Grendel? I’ve heard that name.\nSALLY: Of course, Hex... The book! The story the Doctor was talking about.

Do not let this she-wolf reach the door.\nACE: I’m not trying to reach the door. (FX: TAKING SWORD FROM WALL) I’m trying to reach one of the big pointy swords you’ve left hanging around on the wall.\nUNFERTH: Now the wench has a weapon!\nACE: I told you. Don’t ‘wench’ me, bumfluff-boy, not if you don’t want me to give you your first shave with a three-foot razor.\nUNFERTH: O-Odin save me!\nACE: Well?!?\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (LAUGHS, BREAKING TENSION) Ha!

My name is Be-owulf!\nACE: Beowulf? You’re why the Doctor came here!\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (CHUCKLING) We have seen many strange visitors these last few nights. You are the most amusing.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 69\nACE: This is gonna sound like a strange question — but, have you seen a tall black box appear from nowhere?\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (SUDDENLY SERIOUS) Men! We have had our sport. Return to the King’s tower. Tell Weohstan I await him.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Out! (SHOUTING) Out! (THREATENING) I’11 finish this alone.\nACE: (WORRIED) What did I say?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: ‘The Traveller will see the end of his path...’ (SCRUNCHING PAPER) Oh, Nostradamus. There’s no profit in prophecy.

That you met this other Valkyrie?\nOLD BEOWULF: Fifty years ago.\nSALLY: (DISBELIEVING) How old were you? Two? You don’t look fifty now.\nOLD BEOWULF: Is this another enchantment? You look in a man’s face and tell the number of his years?\nHEX: How about- how many winters have passed?\nOLD BEOWULF: More than can be counted upon a man’s fingers. So, fifty. This is what Weohstan always told me.\nSALLY: Technically, it’s eleven, but we’ll let that pass.\nOLD BEOWULF: Wiglaf knows the tale. He has heard it often enough.\nWIGLAF: My father travelled with Lord Beowulf for many years, seeking fortune and adventure. They crossed the sea to the land of the Danes, of King Hrothgar, where a demon terrorised the people. For years, the brute plagued Hart’s Hall. Its rage was swift and cruel. It ate men whole, leaving nothing behind. King Hrothgar despaired. [His kinsmen and his thanes had all tried to fight the beast, but none prevailed. This spawn of hell destroyed any sword, and the strongest mail offered no defence. At last, Lord Beowulf and his men arrived at the coast. The watchmen challenged him, but he made clear his intent to pay respects to the King. And to do him honour by ridding him of this evil. ]\nSALLY: (SOTTO) Hex, I think we overshot. We’re about fifteen years off. And a good few hundred miles, from the sound of it.\nHEX: (SOTTO) Fifteen years, or fifty — doesn’t make much difference. If that’s where Ace and Lysandra are, it might as well be a lifetime ago.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 72\nOLD BEOWULF: Valkyrie! Pay attention. This is the good part.\nWIGLAF: (CONTINUOUS ) They marched to the hall, and Lord Beowulf prepared to do battle...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. HART’S HALL\nYOUNG BEOWULF: What do you know of the black doors?\nACE: That, er.. they bring the sound of the wind rushing down from Olympus? Hang on. Wrong gods. A big wind anyway.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: How do you know this?\nACE: Because that’s where I’m from.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (UNSURE) Ha. You... mock.\nACE: And here they are. (FX: JUMPING DOWN, RUNNING OVER TO COVERED TARDIS) Under these skins — (FX: UNCOVERS TARDIS)\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (GASPS) It is a sign. The black gates appeared there before I fought the demon. My victory summoned you?\nACE: Yeah. I’m here to... congratulate you. Er. Well done. (BEAT) Better still — (WHISPERS) I can open the doors.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (AWED) This is truly the Hall of the Gods. Is it my time? Am I to enter Valhalla?\nACE: Nah. Just a preview, mush. Your time’s not up yet.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: No. I am not worthy. If you came from there, then you know my shame. (WHISPERS) When I heard the breath of the Gods, when the Black Doors appeared... I ran. When I returned, they were gone. And the fiend had arrived.\nACE: You were scared. But you came back. That’s the brave bit.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Who are you? Brunhild, returned from legend?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 74\nACE: No, I’m Ace.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Aesir? You are of the Gods? (DROPPING TO KNEES) Could you be... Lord Odin’s consort, great F-[rigga]\nACE: Nah. Just Ace. Get up, beardy. You’ve some questions to answer. You’re in charge round here, right?\nYOUNG BEOWULF: No, my home is over the sea. I have no kingdom. I came to pay respects to King Hrothgar.\nACE: (PICKING UP GOBLET) And you’ve been on the mead. Celebrating.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: I did defeat a demon.\nWEOHSTAN: (ENTERING) Lord Beowulf. The men said you’d found a.. companion.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: This is Ace. She came through the black gates. See. (AWED WHISPER) The way to Asgard.\nWEOHSTAN: (SUSPICIOUS) Indeed. Hart’s Hall is most honoured to be visited by gods and monsters this night.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Weohstan is a wordsmith. He tells the tale better than a humble warrior.\nACE: Don’t bother. I think I know this one. This monster whatsisname’s been terrorising the king’s hall for years.\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Years? ‘Tis not one moonspan since we came to these shores.\nWEOHSTAN: (SOTTO) Years would work well.

Will this Gar-undel end the attacks as promised?\nACE: You’re part of all this — aren’t you, Weohstan?\nWEOHSTAN: People need their heroes, girl. The men love Lord Beowulf. They want to follow him.\nACE: What are you? His PR?\nWEOHSTAN: You think the commoners here know Hrothgar is their king? No. They hear tell of the son of Halfdane, from the line of Shield Sheafson. Tales of his forefathers carried Hrothgar to the throne. The people set store in stories. The lords rally behind a hero.\nACE: That’s what you’re doing for Beowulf?\nWEOHSTAN: A leader must make allies, gain experience. I am building a legend. Beowulf left his homeland as an adventurer. With Hrothgar’s blessing, he will return as king-in-waiting.\nACE: Does he get a say in all this? Or are you just manipulating him?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 84\nWEOHSTAN: It is for the good of the people! They need a man like Beowulf to lead them. To unite them.\nACE: You are manipulating him! (BEAT) You and the Doctor — you’d get on.\nWEOHSTAN: Again, you speak of a Doctor. I know no Doctor.\nACE: Look. Beowulf seems like a good bloke. Big and dumb, but basically OK. Good luck to you. For what it’s worth, I think you'll do alright. I just want to find my friends.\nWEOHSTAN: Not until I know how this story ends.\nACE: You're trying to keep a lot of balls in the air, Weohstan. If there’s a real monster out there, you need help.\nWEOHSTAN: Still you claim ignorance. Think on it, girl. Beowulf’s tale may need the slaying of another monster — or a monster’s mother. One way or another, you’1ll not see sunset.\nACE: (BANGING DOOR, SHOUTING) Weohstan! You need me! Get me out of here!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. URODELIAN PODCRAFT\nARISTEDES: What do you know of Time Lords, Garundel?\nGARUNDEL: Oh, I’ve been around. You’d be surprised. Basic bodyscan showed up the two hearts. Respiratory bypass system. Extra ribs. Spare liver.\nARISTEDES: What happened to him?\nGARUNDEL: Oooh, he got pretty beat up by that Warbot outside.\nARISTEDES: How bad is it?\nGARUNDEL: Nothing a few weeks in my regenerative pod can’t fix. Broken bones, fractured skull — no biggie.\nGARUNDEL: In fact, he’s cooking nicely. He’ll be done sooner than expected.\nARISTEDES: Then you’re going to just let him go?\nGARUNDEL: What was it you called me? A ‘good Samaritan’? I like that.\nARISTEDES: You did say you didn’t want to kill anyone...\nGARUNDEL: Oh that? Just a little wager between me and my eighty-two siblings. Whoever makes the most credits with the lowest kill- rate gets the keys to the Mothers-ship.\nARISTEDES: (DISDAINFUL) Oh, so you’re a mercenary.\nGARUNDEL: I prefer the term ‘speculator’. ‘Collector’ even.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 86\nARISTEDES: What do you collect? Apart from broken robots...\nGARUNDEL: I’1ll have you know, lady, Xybrox tech is the most sought-after in this galaxy. On account of it being almost impossible to secure.\nARISTEDES: You thought I was looking for it. Back there in the swamp. You’re hiding!\nGARUNDEL: That Xybrox ain’t coming after me anytime soon.\nARISTEDES: But it will be coming, won’t it?\nGARUNDEL: I knocked out its ship’s systems. And the auto-repair bots. And the backup mainframe. Could be a week, could be a decade — but Xybrox are extremely antsy about other people playing with their toys. It’ll come all right. But I’1ll be long gone by then.\nARISTEDES: Where to? This doesn’t look like a long-haul flyer.\nGARUNDEL: The Mothers are gonna be looping round the Milky Way for the next few decades. Rich pickings. I’ve sent a signal, but in the meantime I gotta get my hands dirty in local politics.\nARISTEDES: Yes, you mentioned a ‘local partner’?\nGARUNDEL: More a stooge. OK, a little unfair — he did drag me froma burning pod.\nARISTEDES: Oh, right. So you crash-landed here?\nGARUNDEL: I admit, my ship experienced an uncharacteristic malfunction after the Xybrox sting. I finished up belly-up in the swamp. (FX: LASER FIZZ) With a busted control panel.\nARISTEDES: So what about your rescuer?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 87\nGARUNDEL: We came to an arrangement. There’s a local King he wants to impress. I terrorise his hall with my Warbot. Vapourize a few apes. His buddy comes in and saves the day.\nARISTEDES: And what do you get out of it?\nGARUNDEL: The, ah, spontaneous descent burnt out my reactor plates. What I need is inert metal plating. And what they’ve got here is-\nARISTEDES: Gold.\nGARUNDEL: Which reminds me — (FX: DIGITAL BEEPING) — I’ve a meeting in ten minutes. (CONSIDERS) But you’d really like to know what happened to your Time Lord pal wouldn’t you?\nARISTEDES: Well what do you think?\nGARUNDEL: OK, so last night was gonna be the finale. One-to-one combat, beat the monster. I ‘ported to the Hall and found a hidey-hole while the Warbot made its own way...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. HART’S HALL [FLASHBACK]\nYOUNG BEOWULF: Gods. What is that sound...?\nGARUNDEL: (V/O) Trouble was, as soon as your guy’s ship arrived, our so- called hero turned tail. I kept my head down...\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (SEEING TARDIS) Black doors. This is not just one demon. What horrors will spill from these gates?\nYOUNG BEOWULF: They open..! (RUNNING AWAY, GOING OFF) Forgive me, Odin. I am not ready for this!\nDOCTOR: [FROM SC. 40] (EXITING TARDIS) Now then. Where are you hiding? .. Right at the beginning? Buried in the middle, perhaps? Or are we at the end?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Hmmm. Could do with a candle. I suppose that’s why they call it the Dark Ages. (FEELING POCKETS) Matches... matches... Where did I put [them?]\nDOCTOR: Ah. Inconvenient. (BEAT) But first things first. (SEARCHING HALL) Beowulf. The wolf of war. Thor’s wolf. The ‘bee-wolf’. All too obvious. What are you calling yourself here? Van-a- gand-r? Loki? Or something else?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Have you hidden it in plain sight? A throne, a sword, a helmet, a...\nDOCTOR: (SURPRISED) A Xybrox Warbot?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 89\nWARBOT: (FX: HEAVILY MODULATED, MECHANISED) Target acquired.\nDOCTOR: Target? I think not, my friend.(FX: BUZZ OF SONIC SCREWDRIVER) Here, let me just —\nWARBOT: (FX: HEAVILY MODULATED, MECHANISED) Target disarmed.\nDOCTOR: That’s not a weapon! Give it back!\nWARBOT: (FX: HEAVILY MODULATED, MECHANISED) Engage target.\nDOCTOR: No! Wait! (CRIES OUT)\nDOCTOR: (FX: FAST MECHANICAL SWIPES. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, MORE — THE\nDOCTOR: BEING THOROUGHLY DONE IN. CRASHING AGAINST TABLE, CHAIRS, SMASHING POTTERY )\nDOCTOR: Ah! .. Ugh! .. Gah! .. Oof! [ETC]\nGARUNDEL: (FX: REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS) (EMERGING FROM HIDING) Whoah, whoah whoah! Stop! Stop! Whoever he is, he doesn’t need the full\nGARUNDEL: treatment! .. Stop!!!\nGARUNDEL: (FX: DOCTOR THUDS INTO STONE FIREPLACE — CRUNK! WARBOT STOPS MOVING)\nGARUNDEL: All done now? (WALKING TO DOCTOR) Eurgh, there’s juice. .. (TO DOCTOR) Sorry about the Warbot, fella, reckon it must’ve been set to ‘maim and mangle’. (BEAT) Who are you?\nDOCTOR: (WEAK) Too soon. I... need... the boss.\nGARUNDEL: (CHECKING VITALS) Breathing — shallow. Pulse... hmm. That’s odd.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 90\nGARUNDEL: OK, so you’re not going anywhere. Lemme reset this baby. (FX:\nMECHANICAL: CLUNKS AS WARBOT RESET)\nYOUNG BEOWULF: (OFF — APPROACHING) Monster! I hear you. Whatever you are, I am prepared to face you now!\nGARUNDEL: (TO SELF) Good boy. (TO DOCTOR) Now, my strangely-vasculatured friend, let’s get you back to my pod.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. URODELIAN PODCRAFT\nGARUNDEL: Used up my teleport charge to get back. And the Warbot did its thing. Hairy apeman had his fight, took his trophy — along with your guy’s sonic gizmo. The Warbot smashed its way out and — well, you know the rest.\nARISTEDES: That’s all he said? ‘I’m sorry.’\nGARUNDEL: And the ‘boss from the Forge’ stuff.\nARISTEDES: (SOTTO, UNSURE) I suppose that must be me.\nGARUNDEL: As last words go, pretty meh. So it’s a good job they won’t be. (MOVING OFF) OK. Time’s a-pressing, sister. I gotta go see a man about a god.\nARISTEDES: (CALLING) You’re not just leaving me tied up?\nGARUNDEL: (LEAVING) Try not to wreck the joint while I’m away. Any more than it already is. And mind that laser! (HE’S GONE)\nARISTEDES: Don’t worry, I will! (SHIFTS HERSELF AROUND; TO SELF) Mind it so carefully while I’m using it to burn through these ropes. (FX: BUZZ OF LASER, CUTTING RESTRAINTS THROUGH: ) Cos unlike you, my Urodelian friend, I can’t just grow back anything that gets cut off...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. HART’S HALL — DUNGEON (INSIDE CELL)\nACE: Hello? (BEAT) Is someone there? (BEAT) Weohstan? That you again?\nACE: Hello?\nACE: Blimey. (BEAT) Well, I’m not playing orthodontist to the gift- horse... (HEADING OFF) Thanks, whoever you were...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: EXT. FENS\nWEOHSTAN: (STAGE WHISPER) Gar-endel! I have the payment.\nGARUNDEL: Right on time. (STEPPING FORWARD) Nice effort with the name. See, politeness costs nothing. Terrorising a kingdom however, that’1l come in at around ten kilos of gold.\nWEOHSTAN: (HANDING OVER BAG) The King’s gratitude is boundless. There are horses to be had. Jewels. Fine swords and armour too. Are these coins really all you want?\nGARUNDEL: (TAKING BAG) Gold’s all I asked for and gold’s all I want. I got my vices, but one thing I can never be accused of is greed, my hairy little friend. (FX: JINGLING GOLD COINS AS HE LOOKS IN BAG) Hmm, little more... ‘bitty’ than I’d hoped. But hey, I can work with this.\nWEOHSTAN: (TENTATIVE) Is... our business concluded?\nGARUNDEL: Sure is, Weohstan old buddy. Go. Good luck with the whole.. king thing.\nWEOHSTAN: That is all, man of the marshes? You need no other sacrifice?\nGARUNDEL: Well, if you’re offering. I’1ll take your firstborn!\nWEOHSTAN: (TAKEN ABACK) My- my son, Wiglaf. He is far from here. I — I cannot, I could not- He is not eight summers old...\nGARUNDEL: Oh, I’m kidding you! Get away, you gullible old hairball, you.\nWEOHSTAN: (DEPARTING) Fare well, toad-man. Gar-endel. I will remember you!\nGARUNDEL: (CALLING) And your memory will stay with me. (SOTTO) As long as your body odour clings to this bag. Ew.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 94\nGARUNDEL: (TO HIMSELF) Now, I gotta a whole new venture in mind. But I first I gotta find that bust-up Warbot...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: INT. URODELIAN PODCRAFT\nARISTEDES: (TRYING POD CONTROLS) Doctor? Can you hear me in this pod thing? Thing is, I can’t open it. Must be time-locked. (BEAT; TO SELF) He’s trapped.\nARISTEDES: SCENE 65: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM [FLASHBACK]\nDOCTOR: Question. When is a trap not a trap?\nARISTEDES: (FROM UNDER CONSOLE, FIDDLING WITH MECHANICS) What?\nDOCTOR: A little slower with the dimensional dampers.\nARISTEDES: (UNDER CONSOLE, ANNOYED) Ah! Thought I had it that time.\nDOCTOR: She needs coaxing, not pummelling. Don’t you, old girl?\nARISTEDES: (GETTING UP) You’re distracting me with riddles. We’re supposed to be training. You could at least put your book down.\nDOCTOR: ‘The Tale of Beowulf’. An engrossing read.\nARISTEDES: Business or pleasure?\nDOCTOR: You can really get the measure of a man from the stories told about him.\nARISTEDES: So what does that make you, Doctor? I’ve seen the files in the Forge.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR: I never read reviews. Besides. It’s not the opinion of the human race that matters at the moment.\nARISTEDES: Really?\nDOCTOR: No. What we’re doing is for the benefit of certain... higher powers.\nARISTEDES: You’re making a reputation for yourself?\nDOCTOR: I have several reputations, depending on whom you talk to.\nARISTEDES: So who should I be talking to? Let me guess, these ‘Elder Gods’ we've been tracking? (SLOWLY) You want them to think you mean business, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Think of it as... a declaration of intent.\nARISTEDES: Or of war?\nDOCTOR: Wars need soldiers. Wars have casualties.\nARISTEDES: What exactly is it you’re planning, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I will tell you, Lysandra. (SOTTO) I’11 tell you all... (ALOUD) but only when the time is right.\nARISTEDES: That’s the trouble. It’s never the right time.\nDOCTOR: You’ve seen these creatures. You know how dangerous they are.\nARISTEDES: You want them to think you’re the same. On a mission. To wipe them out.\nDOCTOR: That should get their attention. Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 97\nARISTEDES: Then they’1l try and stop you.\nDOCTOR: Which brings me back to my question. When is a trap not a trap?\nARISTEDES: I give up.\nDOCTOR: When it’s an-ticipated.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 66: INT. URODELIAN PODCRAFT\nARISTEDES: (FX: KNOCKING ON HOLLOW SHELL) Well, you didn’t anticipate this, did you Doctor? OK, so here’s my plan. Garundel’s got a teleport, right? So —\nARISTEDES: . somewhere in my backpack, there’s a teleport-tracker... (FINDS IT) Ah-ha!\nARISTEDES: Yeah, all this and the kitchen sink, Ms McShane. (EXITING PODCRAFT) Catch up with you later, Doctor. Don’t go anywhere, will you?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: INT. BEOWULF’S RUINED HALL\nDOCTOR WHO: REPRISE FROM SCENE 55:\nOLD BEOWULF: See, boy — the creature’s head.\nHEX: Thanks, but I don’t wanna see my friend’s head, you sicko —\nSALLY: Hex. Look. Look!\nHEX: Oh my — [God].\nSALLY: It’s from some sort of robot.\nHEX: OK. So Beowulf here didn’t kill the Doctor. He’s stilla psycho, though.\nSALLY: Your majesty — where did you get this?\nOLD BEOWULF: It belonged to creature with iron skin, one with the strength of twenty men. I faced it alone.\nSALLY: Can I... take it?\nWIGLAF: My lord, Should we allow-\nOLD BEOWULF: (FX: HANDING WARBOT HEAD OVER) Here, Valkyrie. Mind, ‘tis heavier than it looks.\nSALLY: (TAKING IT) Thank you, sire. Hex, this thing is completely dead.\nHEX: Well, yeah, obviously —\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 99\nSALLY: Think! If we could get it working, the Doctor might be able to home in on it.\nHEX: Anachronistic technology, I get you!\nOLD BEOWULF: ‘Doctor’. Ace spoke of this Doctor, too.\nHEX: Please, your Maj. What happened to Ace?\nWIGLAF: (ASIDE, TO BEOWULF) Sire. We should prepare. The dragon does not rest for long.\nSALLY: My lord, was there another Shieldmaiden, too? One dressed like me?\nOLD BEOWULF: (TRYING TO REMEMBER) Oh, it was all so long ago...\nSALLY: Believe me, you’d remember Captain Aristedes.\nWIGLAF: There is a time for story-telling. This is not it. My shield lies out in the field. And our rations. Naegling too.\nHEX: ‘Naegling’? Is that another of your men?\nWIGLAF: King Beowulf’s sword. (BECOMING SUSPICIOUS) Another tale not reached Valhalla? You will tell me next you have never heard of Wayland’s Shield!\nOLD BEOWULF: Go, Wiglaf. I will follow.\nWIGLAF: Soon, my Lord. Please. (EXITS HALL)\nOLD BEOWULF: So like his father. Weohstan did not trust Ace. I could see her for what she was though. A warrior. I thought her... comely. (BEAT) Oh, and she proved true. Fought like a she-wolf. Right to the end.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 100\nHEX: What do you mean, ‘the end’?\nWIGLAF: (OFF, OUTSIDE) My Lord. Come! See! More enchantment.\nOLD BEOWULF: Perhaps Wiglaf is right. The time for tales is gone. I was never much good at them anyway. (EXITS HALL)\nSALLY: Hex, I’m worried about the others. I’m starting to think maybe they’re the ones who ended up in the wrong place.\nHEX: Still doesn’t explain why that robot had the Doctor’s sonic. You know what though? What you said before about the head. If we want technology for him to trace...\nSALLY: Of course! The screwdriver!\nHEX: Think you can get it off the wall? I’1ll give you a leg up...\nSALLY: (PULLING) These rings are rammed right into the stone. There’s a laser-knife in the front of my pack.\nHEX: Course there is. (FX: SEARCHING PACK) This it?\nSALLY: Yeah (FX: LASER KNIFE — CONTINUOUS) It’1ll take a little while to burn through.\nHEX: OK, I’m gonna see what got Mr Happy excited. (BEAT) Sal?\nSALLY: Yeah?\nHEX: It’ll be alright, you know. Honest.\nSALLY: You don’t have to protect me, Hex. But it’s sweet of you to try.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: EXT. BEOWULF’S RUINED HALL\nOLD BEOWULF: (APPROACHING) What now, Wiglaf? Jumping at your own shadow?\nWIGLAF: (AWED WHISPER) My Lord. It is a spirit. White and shimmering. My blade passes straight through.\nOLD BEOWULF: (SEEING TARDIS) No!\nWIGLAF: Your countenance, sire. As pale as the apparition itself.\nOLD BEOWULF: I have seen such a thing before. The gates to Asgard...\nWIGLAF: In Hrothgar’s Hall?\nOLD BEOWULF: Then, their appearance augured great victories. The difference is — those gates were black.\nWIGLAF: And these are white. If the black gates lead to Asgard, then where should these go?\nHEX: (APPROACHING) Oh, you’ve found our TARDIS.\nWIGLAF: (ADVANCING WITH SWORD) You admit this is from whence you came?\nHEX: Put the sword away, Wiglaf. (TO BEOWULF) Tell him, your Maj!\nOLD BEOWULF: I am afraid, boy, that we may have mistaken demons for gods.\nHEX: Aw, c’mon...!\nWIGLAF: (FORCING HEX AT SWORDPOINT) Back inside the hall, knave. I’1l put you and that daughter of Loki to the blade.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: INT. BEOWULF’S RUINED HALL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SONIC SCREWDRIVER BUZZ — FOOTSTEPS AS HEX, BEOWULF, WIGLAF ENTER)\nSALLY: (BUSY WITH SONIC) Hex, it’s working! I’1l turn it up to max.\nWIGLAF: Drop your wand, witch.\nSALLY: (SEEING HEX AT SWORDPOINT — SHUTS OFF SONIC) What’s going on?\nHEX: They saw the TARDIS and freaked.\nOLD BEOWULF: Can it be true, Valkyrie? Have you deceived us?\nSALLY: Your Majesty. We mean you no harm. Hex saved you from the fire.\nWIGLAF: A ruse to win our trust. Are you seeking to steal the King’s treasure for your Master? (ADVANCING ON SALLY) I will test your mortality.\nHEX: Get away from her! (FX: STRUGGLE BETWEEN HEX & WIGLAF. HEX KNOCKED TO FLOOR)\nWIGLAF: (RAISING SWORD) Ha! I shall send you to the next world, boy!\nSALLY: No!\nOLD BEOWULF: (SHOUTS) Stay your arm, Wiglaf! We can’t be sure. The girl’s words are not untrue. I would not wish to offend the gods before a battle. (FRUSTRATED) Agh! I cannot think of these things now.\nOLD BEOWULF: Bind them with ropes, Wiglaf. We’1ll decide their fate after the fight.\nWIGLAF: Unless the dragon decides for us all.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70: INT. HART’S HALL\nARISTEDES: (SOTTO, CREEPING IN) Let’s let sleeping Vikings lie, shall we...?\nACE: (FROM HIDING) Call that twenty minutes, Lysandra?\nARISTEDES: (JUMPING) Ace! Where’ve you been?\nACE: (STEPPING FORWARD) Well, so far I’ve had a fight, been captured, locked up, and escaped. I was on my way back to the\nTARDIS: when I heard you stomping around like a herd of elephants. Thought I’d best nip behind a tapestry. You know, in case it was a herd of elephants.\nARISTEDES: You’re not funny. (FAUX-INNOCENT; KEEPING SCHTUM) So, er — no Sign of the Doctor, then?\nACE: No. But I’ve met Beowulf. I reckon that’s who he was coming to see. No idea why, though. How about you, you seen any sign?\nARISTEDES: Not exactly. There’s alien activity, though. Some extraterrestrial interfering with history. Just the Doctor’s sort of thing.\nACE: That figures. Beowulf’s mate’s got it in for me, and he’s up to his neck in something. Come on. Let’s get back to the TARDIS.\nARISTEDES: OK. Quietly though. We don’t want to wake the Vikings.\nACE: (MOVING FORWARD, BLASE) It’s alright, they’re dead to the world. I wonder what percent proof that mead of theirs is?\nARISTEDES: (GRABBING HER) Still no need to take unnecessary risks.\nACE: You know what, Lysandra, I’ve just about had it with you telling me what to do. You’ve been with the Doctor for, what? —\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: five minutes? And you think you’ve got a better way of doing everything! Well, me and the Professor go back years-\nARISTEDES: Ace, this isn’t about you and your friend romping through time and space. This is-\nGARUNDEL: Surprise! (BEAT) Ooh. Am I interrupting something?\nARISTEDES: Garundel. (SUSPICIOUS) What, you’re not surprised to see me?\nGARUNDEL: Puh-lease. You think I didn’t drop enough hints about the laser? I let you escape. So I could follow the tracker I put in your backpack.\nARISTEDES: Tracker?\nACE: (SARCASTIC) Well done, Captain.\nGARUNDEL: Who’s your friend-in-need-of-a-makeover? Don’t bother to answer, I don’t actually care.\nACE: I’m Ace.\nGARUNDEL: Course you are, sweetheart. And I’m fabulous, thanks for asking.\nACE: What do you want, Kermit? (TO ARISTIDES) This the alien activity you were on about, Lysandra?\nARISTEDES: Yes. (TO GARUNDEL) Thought you’d be busy fixing your ship. And leaving?\nGARUNDEL: The fixing bit’s done. But it occurred to me that you must have gotten here somehow. With our mutual friend in stasis, I put two and two hearts together.\nACE: What ‘mutual friend’?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 105\nGARUNDEL: Ooh. Do I take it that your associate hasn’t apprised you of the Time Lord’s situation?\nACE: Lysandra-?!?\nARISTIDES: 3 oe\nGARUNDEL: Tut, tut. You two have some trust issues, dontcha? As I was saying. He’s a Time Lord. Ergo, he must have a TARDIS. Forget Xybrox tech. Gallifreyan tech takes me into a whole different league.\nACE: What’s that?\nGARUNDEL: Just my little Warbot friend. Think we’d better rouse the natives from their slumbers, don’t you? (FX: KICKING NORSEMEN)\nARISTIDES: No — don’t-!\nNORSEMEN: (WAKING GRUNTS AND GROANS) Uggh!/What?/What in Odin’s name...?\nACE: What are you playing at, frog-features?\nGARUNDEL: Wake up, little apemen! Wake up! Time to visit Valhalla!\nNORSEMEN: (ALARMED) A monster!/ An iron dragon!/ Odin preserve us!\nWARBOT: Multiple targets acquired. (FX: BEGINS ZAPPING)\nUNFERTH: Please, I’m too young and handsome to [die-] Aaargh! (KILLED)\nHROTHULF: (BACKING AWAY) I have jewels! I have daughters! I’1l let you have my daughters — Aaaargh! (KILLED)\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SCREAMS, CLANKS AND ZAPS AS NORSEMEN ARE VAPOURISED BY\nWARBOT THROUGH: )\nGARUNDEL: As you can see, the Warbot’s now in near perfect working order. Shame about the arm.\nACE: Stop it! You’re killing them!\nGARUNDEL: Not me, my unkempt friend. Blame the robot.\nGARUNDEL: All done? Good.\nARISTEDES: Alright, Garundel, you’ve made your point. What is it you want?\nGARUNDEL: I thought I’d made myself abundantly clear. Your TARDIS. But first I need rid of the passengers. (DRAWING HIS BLASTER) Don’t worry sister, this time the blaster’s set to kill. It’1ll ruin my scoresheet, but hey. Some things are worth the price.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 71: INT. BEOWULF’S RUINED HALL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WIND WHISTLING — ROAR OF XYBROX JETS BUILDING AS IT SWOOPS ABOUT IN DISTANCE, GETTING CLOSER THROUGH: )\nSALLY: (SQUIRMING IN ROPES) Ow. Hex! That’s my arm again.\nHEX: (STRUGGLING) Sorry. These ropes are pretty tight. You remembered to do the thing when they tied them —\nSALLY: Tensing muscles to stretch the ropes? Yes. Part of the Doctor’s basic training!\nHEX: (WORKING ON BONDS) We’re a pretty good team, aren’t we, Sal? I mean, we've got ourselves tied up together under sentence of death, but apart from that...\nSALLY: (PLAYFUL) Shut up, Hex.\nHEX: (STRUGGLING WITH ROPES) They’re leather or something. Really dry. No give in them.\nSALLY: I’ll try shifting this way...\nSALLY: Any better?\nHEX: Not really, but I can see through the hole in the roof now!\nSALLY: What’s there?\nHEX: Mist. Some flashes — must be the forest fires.\nSALLY: What is that noise?\nHEX: I’m guessing that’s the dragon.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 108\nSALLY: When do you think they’1ll be back? Wiglaf and Beowulf?\nHEX: I dunno if they’re gonna make it back. The King looked pretty beaten up. From the sound of that thing, a few arrows and a sword aren’t gonna do much damage.\nSALLY: I liked him. There’s something sad about him. I wonder... What happens at the end of the story? Do you know?\nHEX: Never read it. (BEAT) Whatever happens, I’m glad I met you, Sal.\nSALLY: Never say die, Hex.\nHEX: Thing is, Sal, I’ve had this feeling the last few weeks — like there’s a guy with a scythe with my name on it? And all the time he’s been getting closer and closer, and the swish of that scythe is getting nearer and nearer, [and]\nSALLY: Now, that sounds closer. What can you see? Hex?\nHEX: It’s just hanging there. I can make out — it’s black and Silver. It’s no dragon. But it’s... massive. Oh no. I think it’s seen us.\nSALLY: Hex, what’s it doing?\nHEX: It’s heading straight for us!\nHEX: (FX: XYBROX HOWL — MONSTROUS AND MACHINE-LIKE — ROAR OF FLAME BLASTING THE HALL)\nHEX: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 109"

What did Weohstan have to say?\nOLD BEOWULF: Weohstan... his manner was strange. When I reached the lakeside, he was standing there. A strange light in his eyes. He did not speak, but dived down to the beast’s lair also. Two days later we sailed for home with Hrothgar’s blessing.\nARISTEDES: Weohstan must have been upset at losing his friend.\nWIGLAF: What do you mean, Valkyrie? My father was a faithful servant. He was no ‘friend’ to monsters.\nARISTEDES: Don’t you get it? He set it up. The Warbot attacking the Hall. Beowulf getting the credit for stopping it. Weohstan made a nice little deal with Garundel. Only it sounds like it backfired.\nACE: Lysandra. We don’t need to do this now. (CHANGING SUBJECT) Wiglaf. The dragon’s gonna come from the cliffs, right?\nWIGLAF: (CONFUSED) That- that is where it returns to.\nACE: OK. Lysandra, Sally. Take your big guns to the other side of the hall for cover.

Don’t ‘Ma’am’ her. (LEAVES)\nSALLY: Yes ma’am. (LEAVING) No ma’am. Sorry, Captain.\nHEX: They’1l be OK, won’t they?\nACE: They’ve got the easy bit. We’re the ones who’ll have to deal with it on the ground.\nOLD BEOWULF: (BROODING) Is it true, Aesir?\nACE: Yeah. Don’t worry, we’ve got plasma grenades and a neutron harpoon. If all else fails, there’s Nitro-Nine-\nOLD BEOWULF: No. I mean Weohstan. He brought Grendel to Hrothgar’s hall?\nWIGLAF: It cannot be, sire. It makes no sense.\nACE: Beowulf, look. I’m not gonna lie. Yes. He arranged it. But he did it for you-\nWIGLAF: Sire-\nOLD BEOWULF: (INTERRUPTING) Don’t you see, Wiglaf? How this changes things? I am no hero.

I just want him admit it to our faces.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 89: EXT. CLIFFTOP\nWIGLAF: (LOOKING OVER CLIFF) I see the dragon sinking in the sea.\nACE: You should have let me stop him, Wiglaf!\nHEX: Leave it, Ace. What’s done is done.\nWIGLAF: There! The King’s helmet, on the rocks below... I should climb down to retrieve it.\nHEX: Hold up, there’s something else down there!\nWIGLAF: Where-?\nACE: (EXCITED) There, holding onto the rockface!\nOLD BEOWULF: (OFF, FAINT) Wiglaf! Aesir! Help me!\nWIGLAF: (OFF, OVER CLIFF) Odin be praised! The King lives!\nACE: Good old Beardy.\nHEX: Come on, we’d best help the old fella up. (CLIMBING DOWN)\nACE: You do that. I’m going to find Lysandra.\nHEX: What, you don’t want to help us?\nACE: Love to. But I don’t trust her not to — (STOPS HERSELF)\nHEX: Not to what? Ace?\nACE: Take off without us.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 134\nHEX: C’mon. She wouldn’t-!\nACE: Wouldn’t she-? (GRIM) See you back at the TARDIS. (RUNNING) If it’s still there!\nHEX: (CALLING AFTER) Ace. Ace!!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 90: INT. BLACK TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nSALLY: Deliberately putting us in harm’s way? Weighing our lives up against theirs? No. The Doctor wouldn’t do that. (BEAT) Would he?\nARISTEDES: You can ask him yourself. In ten. Nine. [Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four]\nACE: Lysandra! Don’t even- (SEES EGG) What the hell’s that?\nARISTEDES: I was hoping to spare you this, McShane. .. Three, two, one, zero!\nARISTIDES: (STEPPING FORWARD) Hello... Doctor?\nGARUNDEL: Hello girls. Bet you never thought you’d see me again!\nARISTEDES: (COMPLETELY THROWN) You! But.. you said the Doctor was in there!\nGARUNDEL: Oh he was. But my need was more pressing.\nACE: Didn’t Beowulf cut off your [head]?\nGARUNDEL: Told you, sister. Urodelians grow back anything, given time. How long was I out?\nSALLY: Sixteen years.\nGARUNDEL: (RUBBING NECK) Ooh. No wonder I got a crick in my neck. (FINDING BLASTER IN HOLSTER) Fortunately I also got a blaster. Thanks to my benefactor. Now where was I? Oh yeah. Taking this ship. (DRAWS BLASTER)\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 136\nARISTEDES: But how did you even get in the pod?\nGARUNDEL: Got an offer I couldn’t refuse.\nACE: Where’s the Doctor?\nGARUNDEL: Enough with the questions. Now. To business.\nARISTEDES: What about your scoresheet?\nGARUNDEL: New head. New rules. (BEAT) OK, strictly speaking it’s just new neck. Anyhoo. Eeny, meeny, miney mo. Catch a tadpole by toe. Who, shall, I, shoot, first? Hello. Unlucky, blondie. (MAKES TO SHOOT) Hold up.\nACE: Technical hitch?\nGARUNDEL: Sixteen years in a gunk tank, trigger’s sticky —\nWIGLAF: (ENTERING TARDIS) A monster! In Valhalla itself!\nGARUNDEL: Beg pardon? Do I know you?\nWIGLAF: Fear not, Valkyries, I shall cleave its head from its shoulders! (CHARGING FORWARD) Yaaaa!\nGARUNDEL: Seriously? Again?\nSALLY: Wiglaf, no!\nARISTEDES: a\nARISTEDES: his\nARISTEDES: You stupid- (ANNOYED) It’s not like he had anything useful to\nARISTEDES: tell us.\nWIGLAF: Was my father in thrall to such a beast?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 137\nACE: Same one, actually.\nWIGLAF: Then his debt is paid. Aesir. You should know. The King is here. His wounds are mortal... Hex tends him.\nGARUNDEL: (WEAK, RASPING) A word, ladies...\nSALLY: That’s disgusting.\nWIGLAF: It lives...?!?\nARISTEDES: Morgan. Get him out.\nSALLY: Yes, Ma’am. Come on you. It’s not Valhalla-time yet. (LEADS\nWIGLAF: OUT)\nWIGLAF: (EXITING TARDIS) So many strange sights...\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) The pod... Get me back in. Pleeease.\nACE: Not before you tell us everything.\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) I don’t have much time...\nACE: Then you’d better make it quick.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 91: INT. URODELIAN PODCRAFT [FLASHBACK]\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING V/O) My gill function... keeps my brain alive. For a while. This is how I was back then. In my ship. Weohstan arrived... Only he wasn’t quite himself...\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Garundel. The time of your bargain is come.\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) Weohstan.. Is that you?\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) You have one chance, Urodelian.\nGARUNDEL: not human.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Deliver the Doctor, and you may live.\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) Take him. In the pod. The code-\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) —does not matter. (RAISES SHIELD) I carry Wayland’s Shield. It is the key to many doors.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Could someone give me a hand? Legs are like jelly.\nDOCTOR: Somebody...?\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Doctor. Come with me.\nDOCTOR: (PULLED OUT) Thank you. Do I know you? ...\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (HARD, SOMBRE) Yes. Yes, I rather think I do.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 139\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Garundel of Urodel. You freely discharge this being, under your protection. You deliver him to our possession?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry your head over it, Garundel. I can see you’ve little choice.\nGARUNDEL: Yes! Do it.\nDOCTOR: You're forbidden to interfere directly. So many rules. So many hoops to jump through.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) You can still choose to save yourself, Doctor. Let this creature die.\nDOCTOR: You know I can’t do that.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) The stories about you — ruthless destroyer of worlds. Are they only true when you have your soldiers?\nDOCTOR: You shouldn’t believe everything you hear in stories.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Garundel lies, he cheats, he steals. He has killed.\nDOCTOR: He is not my concern. I am not the moral arbiter of the universe. And neither are you.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) You are saved, Urodelian. Coincidence has been aligned. Your navigational failure. A missing TARDIS. A stray weapon. Fate has conspired. The dice are cast.\nDOCTOR: Dice? I thought we were playing — [chess. ]\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) The game has changed. That... concerns you?\nDOCTOR: I can see you’re not quite yourself. Filtering your essence through a Nordic bloodline. It’s a good trick. But I’ve seen it done before. (BEAT) Who’s the unfortunate you’ve possessed?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 140\nWEOHSTAN: It is of no consequence.\nDOCTOR: A local lord? No. From the armour, I’d say a visitor. One of Beowulf’s men?\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) This mortal will remember nothing. He dies twelve years hence in his bed. That is the end of his story. You, Doctor, have another chapter ahead. It will not be pleasant.\nDOCTOR: I expect nothing less. What of my friends?\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) They are no longer in this time. The forces of chaos range against them.\nDOCTOR: I have every faith in their abilities.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) You cannot save the boy. He is marked. The girl is a wolf you have steeped in blood.\nDOCTOR: No! They are innocent. I’m protecting then...\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) You are willing to let the soldiers die in their stead?\nDOCTOR: Not willing, no. But they know the risks.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Do they truly? Have you told them?\nDOCTOR: Not yet. But I plan to.\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) Your plans end here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Then I’1l have to improvise. (BEAT) That should scare you. Don’t forget your bargain.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 141\nWEOHSTAN: (POSSESSED) There, Urodelian. You are in place. (PUTTING BLASTER IN GARUNDEL’S HOLSTER) You will have need of your weapon.\nDOCTOR: (OFF, AS POD DOOR CLOSES) Ah, I was right. The co-ordinates are inscribed on the shield. The boss from Wayland’s Forge. I should have-\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHIELD CRACKLES — DISTORTED TELEPORT ZIP AS DOCTOR\nVANISHES: — POD DOOR CLOSES.

The Doctor vanished. That’s everything. I swear. Now... please.\nARISTEDES: The boss, the Forge. Why does he keep saying that?\nACE: Alright, Lysandra. Kermit’s suffered enough.\nHEX: (ENTERING) .. Ace? Ace, you need to come quick. It’s the King, [he’s-]\nARISTEDES: Ah, Schofield. Just the man.\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) In... the... pod...\nHEX: I know I’m a trained nurse, but I must have missed the day they did advanced decapitation.\nARISTEDES: You heard him. He’s re-attached his head in there once already. Take the.. parts and put them in.\nHEX: Why me? (LIFTING GARUNDEL’S HEAD) Eeurgh.\nARISTEDES: Think of it as... a facelift.\nGARUNDEL: (RASPING) Funny. See you in the next life, sister.\nARISTEDES: Not if I see you first, toad-man.\nACE: Whatever was controlling Weohstan used the shield to send the Doctor — where?\nHEX: Shield-?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 143\nACE: Wayland’s shield! Weohstan mentioned it before.\nARISTEDES: I’m guessing it’d have been passed down to his son...?\nACE: But it’s wood. It’s all burned up.\nHEX: No. Not the middle bit. You know, the grip. It’s metal.\nARISTEDES: Of course. The boss. It’s called the shield boss.\nWIGLAF: (OFF, OUTSIDE TARDIS) The King! The king is dying!\nACE: What? But I thought-\nHEX: I came to tell you, Ace. There’s nothing more anyone can do.\nACE: I should go. (HURRIES OUT)\nARISTEDES: (CALLING AFTER) Ace. We need that shield!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 93: INT. BEOWULF’S RUINED HALL (DOORWAY)\nACE: (HURRYING OVER) What happened-?\nWIGLAF: He fell. At the door. He should be in his Hall. For the end.\nSALLY: Ace, help me.\nOLD BEOWULF: (WEAK) Ah. My Valkyries. You bear me to the gates of Valhalla...\nACE: Don’t try to move.\nSALLY: (SOTTO) He’s lost a lot of blood. Hex says there’s massive\nSALLY: internal damage. Every bone, broken. I can’t believe he made it back.\nACE: (SOTTO) He’s a one-off, that’s for sure. (ASIDE) Wiglaf, we need your shield.\nWIGLAF: But, my father passed it to me. His father to him-\nOLD BEOWULF: Give it, Wiglaf. We owe the Gods this much. Grant your King his dying wish.\nSALLY: You’re not dying...\nOLD BEOWULF: Lies do not become you, pretty one. You, I think, must be Freya.\nACE: Oi, I thought I was your favourite.\nOLD BEOWULF: (LAUGHS THEN WINCES IN PAIN AND COUGHS) I have done enough? To redeem my honour? To enter Valhalla?\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 145\nACE: Listen, Beardy. In more than a thousand years, a girl ina classroom will pay that bit more attention for a day, because of you.\nOLD BEOWULF: Your words still confuse me. After all this time.\nACE: I’ve a friend. He fights monsters, too.\nOLD BEOWULF: He is lucky to have a cohort such as you.\nACE: You think? I’ve let him down. Been too worried about getting my nose put out of joint. Left it too long.\nOLD BEOWULF: You have time to make amends, Aesir. I do not.\nACE: Don’t...\nSALLY: Ace, we should... I’m sorry, Your Majesty. (SALUTING) It’s been an honour.\nOLD BEOWULF: Were I the monster. And you two were coming... I would be afraid. Go. Find your ‘Doctor’. Fight for him. For me.\nACE: (HOLDING BACK TEARS) Goodbye, Beowulf. We won’t forget. No-one will.\nOLD BEOWULF: Faithful Wiglaf, son of Weohstan. Come.\nWIGLAF: (KNEELING BY BEOWULF) My Lord.\nOLD BEOWULF: Tell me one more tale. Before I sleep.\nWIGLAF: My lord... I do not... I cannot...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 146\nOLD BEOWULF: (GETTING WEAKER) Tell me of the simple warrior who fought monsters. Who became King. Tell me — (BEAT) Tell me the story of Beowulf...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 94: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nARISTEDES: Right. Off you go, Garundel.\nHEX: What was that?\nARISTEDES: Teleport. Back to his ship. His mothership might pick him up — eventually. Besides, he wouldn’t thank us for taking him with us.\nHEX: You’re saying it’s a better option staying here in the Dark Ages with your head cut off than going wherever we’re going?\nARISTEDES: Basically. Yes.\nHEX: Right. Glad we’re clear on that.\nACE: (ENTERING WITH SALLY) Here it is. Wayland’s Shield.\nARISTEDES: Put it on the console.\nACE: The carvings — they’re glowing.\nHEX: The second you put it on the console.\nARISTEDES: Runes. I can’t translate them.\nSALLY: But the TARDIS can! Look!\nARISTEDES: (TAPPING KEYS) Co-ordinates. But they don’t make sense! Time vectors — negative. Spatial positions — imaginary!\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT — RECORDED MESSAGE BROADCAST) Hello? Is this thing recording?\nHEX: The scanner!\nACE: I don’t believe it.\nSALLY: Doctor?!\nDOCTOR: (D) Ah. Yes. (BEAT) Ahem. Attention TARDIS crew members. All four of you!\nARISTEDES: Seems to be an automated message.\nDOCTOR: (D) I’m assuming you’ve made your introductions. Now. If you’re hearing this message, you’re standing in the wrong place. The\nTARDIS: — the two TARDISes — began preparing for symbiotic propulsion as soon as they detected your life-signs in one location.\nARISTEDES: Ah.\nDOCTOR: (D) Once the process has started, do not attempt to move either\nTARDIS: until it’s complete.\nSALLY: Oops. (WHISPERS) Explains our bumpy ride.\nDOCTOR: (D) When the TARDIS — my original TARDIS — is prepared, its next journey will require more power than a single Ship can muster. Back through the birth pangs of this universe. Sideways through the vortex and diagonally through several relative dimensions. I’m afraid the Black TARDIS — the clone, the cutting — will be consumed in takeoff.\nHEX: Ace. Our TARDIS. It’s not white any more. It’s-\nACE: Blue! He set this up...\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 149\nARISTEDES: He must have thought he’d already have the shield.\nDOCTOR: (D) Have a safe journey, and I’1ll see you all very soon.\nSALLY: He knew he’d get taken. He wants us to work together.\nACE: He left a message. He never leaves us messages.\nHEX: Don’t you see, Ace? He’s learned. He’s trying to tell us stuff!\nACE: And you heard what he told us. Everyone. Inside the Blue TARDIS!\nSALLY: What about our equipment, Captain? All the tech and weapons?\nARISTEDES: No time. You heard. In a few seconds this Black TARDIS of ours is going to end up as so much rocket fuel. Come on, Morgan.\nSALLY: Yes, Ma’am! (SHE ENTERS TARDIS WITH ARISTEDES )\nHEX: So where exactly are we going?\nACE: (ENTERING TARDIS) To rescue the Doctor.\nHEX: (ENTERING TARDIS) Rescue him from what?\nHEX: (FX: TARDIS DOORS CLOSE — DEMATERIALISATION WITH RISING HUM OF\nBLACK: TARDIS’S IMMINENT DESTRUCTION CONTINUES THROUGH\nFOLLOWING: )\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 150\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT — RECORDED MESSAGE RESUMES) Ah — good. It’s still recording. It occurs to me I should remind you what I told you in the briefings before I left. (BEAT) But then. It also occurs to me that this message may make no sense at all. (GRAVE) If that’s the case, then leave. Leave now. Whatever time, whatever place you’re in — leave the TARDIS and don’t look back. (BEAT) Because if I haven’t already told you what I’m doing, something’s gone terribly wrong. (CUTS OUT)\nDOCTOR: (FX: TARDIS DEMATERIALISATION BUILDS TO CRESCENDO & IMMENSE EXPLOSION)\nDOCTOR: (V/O) And one day, the little Black TARDIS would be tested. A sacrifice would be needed. And to save her friends, she’d know what to do. (BEAT, DARK) So that they could all live happily ever after.\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 95: INT.

Wait. (BEAT, UNSURE) Was I black? Or was I white? (DISTRAUGHT) Which side was I playing?\nDOCTOR: So.. we play the game again.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART FOUR\nDOCTOR WHO: BLACK AND WHITE by Matt Fitton (FINAL) Page 152\nPRONUNCIATION: Accent always falls on first syllable; make the h before r and n a strongly-breathed sound; ch in the pronunciation equivalent indicates the sound of ch in Bach or Scottish loch.

The Grim Reaper’s not happy, and it appears (from earlier stories) that the Elder Gods of the Universe are aiming to collect on his behalf, bringing the Old Times with them. The Doctor wants to stop them, and the only way to be sure is to cut them off at source. Which means getting back to the Old Times first. But he can’t just fly there — for one, a TARDIS can’t enter easily, and two, they’ll see him coming.\nWIGLAF: Instead, he grows the Black TARDIS for a twofold purpose. He runs the Black TARDIS crew, recruiting soldiers to call out the Elder Gods and let them know he’s gunning for them. That way, he expects they’1l eventually set a trap for him, and he’ll be taken back to the Old Times on their terms — or so they believe. When in fact the Gods will be playing into his hands.\nWIGLAF: Because the other part of the plan is to assemble the two crews and two TARDISes for symbiotic propulsion back into the Old Times. He’s been collecting the items he needs for his plan — next on the list is Wayland’s Shield, containing a legendary ‘key to many doors’ which will provide the co-ordinates for the journey. And given his recent experiences with Ace and Hex, the Doctor actually intends to tell all his companions their precise roles in the final battle with the Elder Gods - when the time is right.\nWIGLAF: Only the trap has been sprung early, and nobody has a clue. They’re going in completely unprepared. And the Doctor can’t possibly be intending to sacrifice his soldiers for his friends... can he? Or is there some other reason that Sally and Lysandra have been chosen? (For the answers, see Story 3!)"
