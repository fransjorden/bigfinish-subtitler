CHARLEY (Not listening) He's absolutely charming!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Well, I don't think so!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY You don't know him!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Well, no, but he said he'd killed me!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Alex Grayle said he'd killed you?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Not Alex! (Realises) Grayle? Alex is also called Grayle? CHARLEY Also?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR As well as Sebastian.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Who's Sebastian?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Sebastian is the Grayle who says he's killed me!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Have you been fighting with Alex's Granddad? He told me they'd met up earlier today—\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Granddad? My aunt Flavia he's his Granddad! He's an Immortal! CHARLEY I'm very confused.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR So's time. Charley, something awful has happened. Sometime in the past.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Is this anything to do with... you know. Rescuing me?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I don't know. I doubt it — this is quite different. Apparently this is a ruse — a falsehood. In reality, the monsters have taken over!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Then how can everything be like this?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Later, Charley, later! We have to get back to the TARDIS, before they decide they don't need this pretend timeline anymore!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor, what—? Oh, wait for me!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Voice fading as he strides off) Come on Charley, we've got a world to save!\nDOCTOR: Scene Four: TARDIS Interior.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Fade into conversation) ...which means that the web of time has been unspun. These masters Grayle talks about have shattered it. The rules don't exist anymore. Grayle can do anything he likes.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I've got the TARDIS out of the false timeline, at least. We're being battered by time storms in all directions. The disruption to the original timeline is vast.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor... this problem with time, please be honest with me now. Is it my fault? DOCTOR Your fault?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY I was talking to Alex... Apparently the newspapers are saying that nobody could\nDOCTOR: have survived the blast that brought down the R/JO/. Remember what Edith Thompson said? I died — they found my diary and everything. Oh, Doctor, if you hadn't rescued me, I would be dead too, wouldn't I? I have read novels on this subject, the person who is rescued when actually their time has come. What you did, it disrupted time, it must have. Have I caused this to happen?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR It's... possible. But no, no, of course it isn't true! If I'm not allowed to rescue just one person... No, it's ridiculous! Charley, you're right, if I hadn't shown up, you would have died on the R/O/. But time has a way of sorting these things out. Grayle and his masters have done this, not us. (Musing) Grayle must have followed his family line in this fictional world of his and arranged to meet Alex in Singapore, just so he could get you and me there too.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY So what do we do, Doctor? The damage has already been done!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Quite right. But thanks to Grayle, the rules are suspended. We can play him at his own game. We have license to meddle! We can go back to when this all started, when Grayle's masters first contacted him. We can prevent this from happening!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY We get to save the universe?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Again. The question is, where, and more importantly, when, did Grayle get his invitation to immortality?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Um. That is a rhetorical question, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Actually you probably do hold the key to answering it. Could I just... Well, I don't really know how to put this...\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY How unusual.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR What I want to know is... well... you see... Oh, here, just put this under your tongue!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Wh- uggh ugh ugh?!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I assume that means ‘what is it?' It's a genetic sampler. And it's just taken a\nDOCTOR: microscopic DNA swipe of your mouth.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR It feeds the information directly into the TARDIS console. Which saves me asking you whether or not you kissed your friend Alex.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Oh.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Ah.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Oh.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The TARDIS can tease out the patterns of human DNA throughout the spacetime vortex. We're heading for the Grayle family home. CHARLEY Ah.\nDOCTOR: Scene Five: Creaky Attic.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Shh. Don't disturb the mice.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY This is Alex's family home! We're in the attic. We came up here once to fetch a cricket bat.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Did you meet Sebastian then?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY No. He only became interested in Alex recently. Just before Alex left for Singapore. Which tends to support your theory.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR As does this.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Family photos. Documents...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR There's Sebastian! And this photo dates from the 1800s. Look over here! One very old vase. An amphora.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Isn't that Roman?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Absolutely. And unless there's an antiquarian in the family...\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Not that I'm aware of.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Then Sebastian's Christmas present may prove costly. For him. So what do we have?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY A name. An unholy Grayle.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR A Latin original.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY A conversation. I assume you did your usual act of playing the fool and making him talk?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Do I do that?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY I, erm, always assumed you did.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Oh. (A short, rather hurt, pause, then...) He's immortal, because of his masters.\nDOCTOR: Masters who feed on the energy of worlds and have tremendous power if they can indulge their slaves so much as to create a whole new timeline for them. Plus, he can't have killed me face to face. That's why he went to the trouble of getting his masters to do that. My death must have been extremely unsatisfying.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Yes, do look on the bright side.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And we also have your carefully sampled DNA chain. CHARLEY (Embarrassed cough) Yes.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Let's do some research, shall we? Then: we go on the offensive!\nDOCTOR: Scene Six: Roman Camp.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Ave, Lucilius. Cold night, eh?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Ave, Marcus. This rain! You wonder what's going to fall out of the sky next! It's why the Picts breed so hard.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Do you mean that they're a hardy breed, or that they spend so much time doing it? LUCILIUS Both. At least we won't see their fetid hides tonight. Pity the poor sentries up on the wall.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Pah, they're Dacians, they don't feel the cold either. I miss dear old Londinium. LUCILIUS They say it's warm in Rome.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS You and I never have and never will see Rome. You'll still be conducting the meeting tonight?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS It keeps the men happy. You know, ‘we're brothers in the blood of Mithras', and\nDOCTOR: all that.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I know it means more to you than that.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS I suppose so. If I hadn't become a priest I'd probably have ended up dead in the arena. But on nights like this... Oh, thank mighty Mithras for the rain, for it blesses the wheat and gives us our grain! Better?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Sounds more like your old self.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Indeed. I'm one of the few priests in this loose brotherhood who actually means what the incantation says: I wish I could have been there to kill the demon bull myself. My life seems to be missing that: its greatest challenge, its reason to be. We're never going to have a major battle against the Picts, are we? The wall is there, the empire's there for the Britons...\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I know, it seems sometimes that we've done all there is to do. That this is as far as we get. We should bring the Picts into the Empire, go as far as there is to go.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS But we're never going to. Anyhow, I'm on my way to sacrifice our earthly bull. If you have a moment? It might cheer us both up.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Delighted to help.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Nobody about. Come on, Charley!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Wait a minute, I'm trying to keep my toga out of the mud!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR So am I! Now, you're certain my bottom doesn't look big in this?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor... We really do have more important things to think about.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Of course, of course! But just take a moment to consider how well we're doing!\nDOCTOR: For once, we've arrived somewhere in exactly the right costumes, having thoroughly read up on our destination! It feel I luxurious!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Was it really worth three weeks at that awful Abbey?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The Abbot of Felsecar is the greatest authority on human genealogy in the Milky Way! And now we know that the first instance of the name Grayle appearing in the records in a British context was right, here, on the payroll of this very Roman fort, in 305 AD, the year of the two Emperors, Constantius and Galerius.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY So we find Grayle, and shoot him.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR We do not shoot him.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Or catapult him, or feed him to the lions!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR We find out if he's contacted his alien masters yet, and try to stop whatever he's doing.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY You do always go the pretty way. (Pause) I'm joking!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Are you?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Or we could stone him, or throw him off the wall of the fort...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Charley...\nDOCTOR: Scene Seven: Temple.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS It's so much more than blood. It's a sacrament. A promise from Mithras that he won't allow the demon bull to ravage the world again as it did before. (Pause) Listen to me! I sound almost Christian, don't I?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I like the fact you're into it. For me it's just a good excuse for an amphora of wine and a song afterwards.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS That's how most of the men think.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Don't you worry. You should talk to that Christian down in the village: the Greek. There's a fanatic for you. Do you know, he won't admit the existence of other gods!\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS They won't get very far like that.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I'm amazed they've got this far. A soldier can appreciate this Mithras chap.\nDOCTOR: Persian: we all know what good lads they are. Fond of the sun. Perished in battle. All very noble. This slave Christ was hung on a... (embarrassed) you know.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS That's the attraction of fundamentalism. You get to be a fanatic. Our society of comrades gets the common soldier. Not too religious: just looks out where the birds are flying and\nDOCTOR: does a bit of hail Pallas Athena at the weekend—\nDOCTOR: MARCUS It's the bathing in blood. All lads together. A great laugh. So who's the penitent tonight?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS It's, erm, Decurion Gralae.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Oh no. I may be indisposed after all.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS He's just a little... intense.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS He's mad as the moon! Have you heard some of the stuff he comes out with? It's hardly Mithraism at all!\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS So let him do it his own way. What are we, Christians?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Listen, Marcus, I'll bet that as we speak, Decurion Gralae is in his tent, muttering\nDOCTOR: to something under his breath. And I doubt that something is Mithras!\nDOCTOR: Scene Eight: Tent.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Oh, my great Lord, help me see you as you truly are... show me the truth... CHARLEY (From outside the tent) Well, go on then. Knock.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (From outside the tent, to Charley) How exactly do you knock on a tent? Oh well, never mind. Erm, hello? Anybody in?\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Yes? Please, please... enter.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Oh, hullo.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Ave, strangers. Iam Decurion Sebastius Gralae. How may I aid you?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY (Whisper) Is that him?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Whisper) A little younger, but yes! (To GRAYLE) I'm Ambrosius Clemencis, and this is my friend—\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Daisius Daisius.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Odd to see a woman in camp at this time of night. I advise you to leave as soon as possible, the fort is no place for a lady after dark.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Thank you for the warning.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Lady, there is always danger in a military camp. Women are what make the best\nDOCTOR: of men. They offer us absolution, forgive us, and give us a reason to aspire to greatness. Such as you must be protected at all costs. Let me say again, depart swiftly!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm very pleased to meet you too, Decurion Gralae. Or have we met before? GRAYLE Why, no, I don't think so—\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Fantastic!\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE What's this about? I have to go and officiate at the temple in a moment. DOCTOR Oh no no no! My friend and I have vital information about the Picts. This is much more important than anything else you might have got planned.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE What sort of information?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Tell him, Dasicus.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Daisius.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I call her that for short. Well?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY The Picts are revolting, under a new war leader, King Caractacus.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE How do you come by this intelligence?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR We were travelling in the hills when we saw the ladies and the pages of the court of King Caractacus—\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Just passing by.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE That does sound urgent. But it can wait until after I've been to the temple. DOCTOR Why, Decurion? What's so special about tonight at the temple? Is there going to be a tombola?\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE I... I... [have to go! Lady, follow my words and leave this place!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm going to follow him! Charley... search the tent!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Oh, of course. It falls to me to sort through the used undergarments of an ancient Roman.\nDOCTOR: Scene Nine: Temple.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I seem to have misjudged Gralae. Far from being fanatic, he's not here at all! LUCILIUS We're going to need someone to manhandle the entrails. And where's the ritual sword?! I can't do everything!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS It's not on the altar already? Gralae must really have something on his mind. Ah, talk of the bullock...\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Sorry, I was disturbed.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS (Aside) I'll say.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Fine, fine, you're here now, brother. Go and get the entrails. Marcus, if you collect\nDOCTOR: the sword then we should be all set.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Oh, hello, am I in time for the meeting?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Of course! Come in, brother! New comrades are always welcome.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm not a comrade. I'm shopping around. Trying out all the different cults. Seeing what suits me.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Absolutely. The only sane thing to do. I still like a bit of the mysteries of Mercury every now and then.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS There's a place in the third rank. You're just in time for the bloodbath.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The story of my life. Nice sword, by the way I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. Could I have a look?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS You're welcome to, brother. I've not seen another like it in all my years in the\nDOCTOR: legion, either. There's something of an aura about it. The story goes that it's Mithras' own sword, his weapon of rustless metal with which he killed the demon bull. It's certainly killed a few bulls here in its time.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Fascinating. And who'll be using it tonight?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS That fellow over there, Decurion Gralae.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Unfortunately.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Should he be moving the statues around like that?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Oh, by Jupiter! Sorry. He's putting them in the wrong positions! LUCILIUS Leave him be. I'll have a quiet word afterwards.\nDOCTOR: Scene Ten: Tent.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Oof! If there isn't anything here, then I-\nDOCTOR: NIMON (Over communicator) Gralae? Is that you?! Gralae?! Is it time yet?! CHARLEY (Trying to sound male) Erm, no! No, it is not time yet!~ Over and out!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Scene Eleven: Temple.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR So what happens now?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Lucilius announces the bloodbathing, and then Gralae carries it out.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR He looks a bit strange.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS He's not supposed to still be wearing his armour. Got here in a rush, apparently.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Where does he come from?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Oh, he's from Londinium, like us, of Briton stock. We're not high on the list of Roman tourist spots since we had that independence business. Gralae's a fellow Decurion, changed his family name from something barbarian, but born within the sound of Boudicca's Bells. He's not some Greek mystic, he's just got some wild ideas. He tried to talk to me about them, at the start of our tour of duty, back when he thought I'd listen.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Like what?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS He kept asking me if we were certain who we should worship. Mithras killed the demon bull, you see, to save us all. But he kept saying that the bull was the powerful one, a kind of cleansing force, that would wipe out our enemies and return the Empire to the glory it held during the realm of Emperor Hadrian. Instead of the mess we're in at the moment.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Isn't that blasphemy?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS What, like the Jews and Christians have? No, my friend, you believe what you want. If someone who was... (embarrassed) you know... can have a cult of his own, anyone can! Oh, now shh, Lucilius is ready to speak.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Dearly beloved, Mithras is with us. ALL And we are with him. LUCILIUS Before we proceed to the bloodletting, I have a few announcements. Centurion\nDOCTOR: Severinus Paulus is getting married on Saturnsday, so let us wish him well in our prayers this evening... (He continues, under...)\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Oh no, that's quite out of the question I'm afraid, no women in the temple! CHARLEY What?!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I thought you didn't believe in blasphemy?\nDOCTOR: MARCUS There's wild speculation on one hand and getting a woman near the blood on the other! Please!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Relax. We'll disappear outside for a minute.\nDOCTOR: Scene Twelve: Roman Camp.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY You'd think we were in the Dark Ages! DOCTOR Not for a couple of hundred years. Now what is it? CHARLEY There's a device in Grayle's trunk. It looks like it's from the future. A sort of\nDOCTOR: pointy thing, pulsing with light. And, Doctor, I think it must be a radio of some kind. It knew I was there, it spoke to me!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Did you bring it?! CHARLEY Well, no. It spoke to me... well, rather angrily, and... DOCTOR They'll be a while with their announcements. Come on, let me see!\nDOCTOR: Scene Thirteen: Tent.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY It's in here.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Wow!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY What is it?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I have no idea. The technology looks familiar. It's definitely some sort of two-way\nDOCTOR: transmitter. This must have been sent to Grayle by his alien friends. Which means he's already in touch with them. Hmm. Odd.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY What?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR It looks as though it should project a hologram as well, but you say it only spoke to you? No pictures?\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY None. So Gralae switched over to sound only? Why would he do that?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I really don't know, Charley. Perhaps our Gralae isn't as certain of his masters as\nDOCTOR: he will be in the future.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Plus he's wearing his armour wherever he goes: not something an immortal would do. DOCTOR Yes, there's a distinct lack of trust there. And he didn't know who I was, of course.\nDOCTOR: I think now would be the ideal time to put Grayle off his stride. He's certainly more human than he was back in Singapore. We can use that.\nDOCTOR: NIMON (Over communicator) Gralae! The time approaches! Have the sacrifices at the appointed co-ordinates. We will switch to the psionic mind beam for the transfer of power. The first instalment of your immortality awaits you!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Right you are! (Whisper) It's tonight! Tonight is when they, whoever they are, begin to make Grayle immortal! CHARLEY We have to stop it!\nDOCTOR: Scene Fourteen: Temple.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS And now let me hand you over to brother Gralae for the sharing of the blood and flesh of the bull that our lord Mithras destroyed that we might live. GRAYLE Thank you, brother Lucilius. (Ritual) I show you the amphorae of the blood. (A\nDOCTOR: shout) And now let me show you where you have gone wrong!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Oh, how terribly dull. It's gone all over the place. (Yell) Will you please stop believing in things, Decurion?! It's very messy! Now where are you going? Oh, in the middle of the ceremony and everything!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I suppose I'll have to haul him back ins- It's locked! That mad old... He's locked us in! What in Hades is he doing?\nDOCTOR: Scene Fifteen: Just outside the Temple\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE I worship the great bull that encompasses all time and space! Master, I can feel you in my head! I call on you to give me now the power that you promised me! I offer the lives of all the men in this temple as a sacrifice worthy of you!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY I thought he was supposed to be in the Temple!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR That was for the ritual gesture. This is for the sacrifice proper. Don't you think it's a much more dramatic effect, here at the very centre of the fortress, open to the sky? That sound... The transfer must be starting already! We've got to stop him!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY How?! Aaah! That light! What is it?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Gravitic distortion. Gravitational lensing! They're phasing energy through the event horizon of a black hole, channelling it directly into his body. Oh pants!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Is this what makes him immortal?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Not quite. This will keep him going for another millennia at least, but he won't be\nDOCTOR: truly immortal until he physically travels through a black hole. The energies are too powerful to be released through space. It looks as though he's quite happy to sacrifice everyone in there for just that much, though. Everyone inside that temple is in terrible danger. We have to get them out!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY He's bolted the door. Hold on...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Come on!\nDOCTOR: Scene Sixteen: The Temple.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Gralae, what do you think you're... Oh, it's you two. What's going on here?\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS Through the window, look at the sky! It's the colour of blood! It's full of light!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Marcus, you've got to get your men out of here.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS We are soldiers in the service of Rome! We do not...\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR If you stay here, you'll all die, for nothing! Facing things like this is my job. LUCILIUS Do as he says! I feel it in my bones, Marcus. This is not the place for this battle. Leave that for another time.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS I knew you'd make a prophecy one of these days! Very well! (To soldiers)\nDOCTOR: Retreat! Abandon the area! We will return in greater numbers!\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS You seem to know what this is about. Can I help?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Erm... I don't know!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Yes, Doctor, what are we going to do?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm going to try talking to Gralae.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Talking to him? But he's going to kill you!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR In the future. Possibly. But the laws of time suspended, remember? There's still a chance that I can talk him down.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY I'm coming with you.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR No. I'm not going to put you in the firing line. Go with Lucilius and make sure that you both get a good distance away from the fortress.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor—\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Please Charley, I'm counting on you...\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY All right. Let's go, Lucilius.\nDOCTOR: LUCILIUS I just hope Marcus and the others have made it to the gates.\nDOCTOR: Scene Seventeen: Roman Camp.\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Keep going men! We're nearly at the gate!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Ignore the sky! It's just the aurora. It's a mirage!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS A demon! A metal demon! Oh, what has this got to do with anything?! Don't just stand there, attack it!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Take it together! Put up your shields! Charge in the tortoise!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS Push it into the ditch!\nDOCTOR: MARCUS That's it lads! We killed it! Now come on, to the gates! Help the servants and the other troopers out! Look to the wounded! Come on, get moving there...\nDOCTOR: Scene Eighteen: In the centre of the camp.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE I can feel... time and space opening up to me... Thank you, masters, for this grace! Until all time can be mine to inhabit, I will serve you faithfully, Lord!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Gralae!\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE You! The stranger!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm not here to hurt you, Gralae. But I am here to stop you sacrificing the lives of all these people.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE They are lambs to be set on the stone! They worship gods which do not exist. Heroes and sprites! Their sacrifice will bring the true Lords into this world once again!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR How? How did you find them?!\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE In my meditations on the nature of power. In my prayers to Mithras. How foolish\nDOCTOR: I was, to imagine he was the centre of all things. As foolish as he, when he thought he had killed the demon bull. That demon called to me, with his fellows. They made me solid offers, came before me in visions. They will take me out of this ignoble place, so far from the fortune that should be mine. DOCTOR A fortune where? In Rome?\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE In Londinium, where the eldest of all my brothers has inherited the villa. I changed my family name to distance myself from such humility. Now I know I shall outlive him, and claim my family's honours and possessions. All the wealth of an undying man!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR That's why you're going to doom an entire world? An entire universe?! For money?!\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE As yet I know not what my masters desire of me. But I think you seek to mislead me, stranger. My masters will grant me power, the strength to make Rome glorious again.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR You really have no idea what you're doing, do you? Gralae, I travel in time. I have\nDOCTOR: spoken to you in the future. Then you had already doomed the world. But it doesn't have to be like that.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Enough! Soon my masters will come, and then my ascension can truly begin. Your lies will not deter me. DOCTOR No. You're wasting your time, Gralae. You're beaten already. The sacrifice you\nDOCTOR: offered has escaped. Without the lives of those men, your masters will stay just where they are. You may live a few extra years, but immortality? I don't think so.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE No! How dare you?!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR For the sake of this world and everyone who lives here, present and future. I can promise you, Gralae, every time you try to summon your masters I will be there to stop you.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE Perhaps I should remove you now then. I am a soldier, and you have declared war on me and the ones I follow. Is it not better to destroy you sooner rather than later?\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR You're making a mistake, Gralae. Why can't you just live out your extra years and gain the fortune you want so badly? We need never see each other again.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE You underestimate me. Extra time is welcome, but it is not immortality. I will\nDOCTOR: only be satisfied when I am immortal, seated among the gods, and my Lords have this world in their hands! If you seek to stop me, then you make yourself my enemy. Make your peace with your gods! CHARLEY Get away from him!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Charley! I told you to—\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY I won't let you hurt him, Gralae. Don't come any closer, or I'll use this thing, I swear' I will!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR The sword from the temple. It looks a bit big for you.\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE You hide behind women, now? When you know I would never harm a lady'? You are not only my enemy, but a coward!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR I'm not hiding, Gralae—\nDOCTOR: GRAYLE No matter. You have won this round, stranger. You have spoilt my sacrifice. But\nDOCTOR: if you get in my way again, with the lady or without, next time I shall put an end to your meddling! CHARLEY Doctor, he's getting away!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Let him. We've done all we can do here. Oh, and thank you for saving my life! But please don't make a habit of disobeying everything I say. I usually have a very good reason. CHARLEY You're welcome. I think I'll keep this sword. It's very jolly.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR (Urgently) But now, we've got to get going! Grayle ran off for a reason, and I\nDOCTOR: don't think it was to return an overdue library book.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY The temple's shaking! Doctor, what's going on?!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Grayle's alien masters were trying to beam the sacrifices to their homeworld using a transmat beam. The shockwaves will destroy the rest of the fortress!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY You're right. We do have to get going!\nDOCTOR: Scene Nineteen: Roman Camp.\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Come on! Back to the TARDIS! Tell me you got everyone else out!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Lucilius was a bit of a straggler but I saw him on his way. They'll all be well clear by now. We're the only ones in danger, actually!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Not far now...\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY There goes the Temple!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR And us next! Come on! The shockwave is going to hit any moment...\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY The huts! The fences! The sky!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Run!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR We sprinted through the fort as the shockwave raced behind us. Buildings\nDOCTOR: exploded into ash as it gained ground. Grayle's masters hadn't got the energy they needed that night, and the destruction was all in vain. When we reached the TARDIS, we were only seconds ahead of the blast.\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR Key... Key, key, key! Ah, there we are!\nDOCTOR: CHARLEY Doctor! We're not going to make it in time!\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE."
